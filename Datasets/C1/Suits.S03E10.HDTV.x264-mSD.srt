<i>Suits...</i>

2
00:00:01,197 --> 00:00:02,225
This is a copy of the letter

3
00:00:02,226 --> 00:00:03,425
you wrote a copy
to the district attorney

4
00:00:03,426 --> 00:00:04,993
when you threatened
expose me.

5
00:00:04,994 --> 00:00:07,470
You ever do send that letter,
you're in the same boat as me.

6
00:00:07,471 --> 00:00:08,638
You want to move in here?

7
00:00:08,706 --> 00:00:11,408
I've only ever
been here twice,

8
00:00:11,475 --> 00:00:13,493
and both times
were with you.

9
00:00:13,577 --> 00:00:15,257
You beat me
on the dissolution negotiation,

10
00:00:15,279 --> 00:00:16,439
you get your name
on the door.

11
00:00:16,447 --> 00:00:17,314
If you think you're gonna win
this time,

12
00:00:17,381 --> 00:00:18,632
you've got another thing
coming.

13
00:00:18,716 --> 00:00:20,083
You ready to use
your relationship with Rachel

14
00:00:20,151 --> 00:00:21,451
to get her father to turn?

15
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:23,153
Doesn't matter,
because I'm not gonna do that.

16
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:25,155
Folsom Foods.
This is about Harvey Specter,

17
00:00:25,222 --> 00:00:27,691
Jessica Pearson,
and their divorce negotiations,

18
00:00:27,758 --> 00:00:29,059
and you don't go to the one
you didn't marry

19
00:00:29,126 --> 00:00:30,326
to stick it
to the one you did.

20
00:00:30,361 --> 00:00:31,561
It's a check
from Folsom Foods.

21
00:00:31,562 --> 00:00:33,163
It's the remainder
of what they owe us.

22
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:35,365
If you crush me,
I'll have nothing.

23
00:00:35,433 --> 00:00:36,399
He was bullying me.

24
00:00:36,467 --> 00:00:38,101
So you used me
to bully him back.

25
00:00:38,169 --> 00:00:39,052
If you don't want
to live with me,

26
00:00:39,136 --> 00:00:40,103
why don't you just tell me?

27
00:00:40,171 --> 00:00:41,504
I just need some time.

28
00:00:41,572 --> 00:00:43,606
- Hessington Oil just fired us.
- Scottie betrayed me.

29
00:00:43,674 --> 00:00:45,408
I gave you my word,
and I honored it.

30
00:00:45,476 --> 00:00:46,943
Something dropped
from the sky,

31
00:00:47,011 --> 00:00:49,179
tilted everything in your favor
right after I cut you a break?

32
00:00:49,246 --> 00:00:51,798
I am not going to dissolve
this merger.

33
00:00:51,882 --> 00:00:52,816
You already signed
the agreement.

34
00:00:52,883 --> 00:00:54,183
Then sue me.

35
00:00:54,235 --> 00:00:56,319
Scottie didn't get us fired.
Ava Hessington did.

36
00:00:56,387 --> 00:00:58,088
She's suing all of us.

37
00:00:58,155 --> 00:01:00,023
I got into Stanford.

38
00:01:16,107 --> 00:01:19,275
You have something
to say to me?

39
00:01:19,343 --> 00:01:21,344
I'm sorry, Scottie.

40
00:01:21,412 --> 00:01:24,314
I didn't believe you,
but you were telling the truth.

41
00:01:25,716 --> 00:01:27,384
Why does it always
have to be so--

42
00:01:27,451 --> 00:01:28,918
- I said I was sorry.
- You didn't mean it.

43
00:01:28,986 --> 00:01:30,286
I meant it.

44
00:01:30,354 --> 00:01:32,022
But just because I was wrong
about you betraying me

45
00:01:32,089 --> 00:01:34,257
doesn't mean I was wrong
to think you might have done it.

46
00:01:34,325 --> 00:01:35,792
See, this is what I mean,
Harvey.

47
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:38,261
If you thought anything of me,
you'd know I'd never do that.

48
00:01:38,329 --> 00:01:39,629
I do think something
of you,

49
00:01:39,697 --> 00:01:41,731
which is why I'm going to
tell you this: Get out.

50
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:43,933
Honor the dissolution agreement
and move on.

51
00:01:44,001 --> 00:01:45,635
You've got to be
kidding me.

52
00:01:45,703 --> 00:01:48,505
You want me to put
all the liability on Edward?

53
00:01:48,572 --> 00:01:50,173
The liability
belongs on Edward.

54
00:01:50,241 --> 00:01:51,775
So when you say that you think
something of me,

55
00:01:51,842 --> 00:01:53,376
what you actually mean is
you want me to help you

56
00:01:53,444 --> 00:01:54,878
to bail
on Darby International.

57
00:01:54,945 --> 00:01:56,346
Scottie,
when this lawsuit's over,

58
00:01:56,414 --> 00:01:57,614
there's not going to be
a Darby International.

59
00:01:57,681 --> 00:01:59,215
- You don't know that.
- What I know is

60
00:01:59,283 --> 00:02:00,850
you have a chance
to get another job

61
00:02:00,918 --> 00:02:03,420
before everything hits the fan.
You won't in another week.

62
00:02:03,487 --> 00:02:05,255
I won't need another job
when I right the ship.

63
00:02:05,322 --> 00:02:07,123
You're not going to right
the ship.

64
00:02:07,191 --> 00:02:09,859
If you were on that jury,
the only question you'd ask

65
00:02:09,927 --> 00:02:12,762
is how many zeroes
to put on the check.

66
00:02:16,117 --> 00:02:18,168
You want me to turn my back
on the man

67
00:02:18,235 --> 00:02:21,571
that I've been in the foxhole
with for the last ten years.

68
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:23,206
Would you do the same?

69
00:02:23,274 --> 00:02:25,308
If that man turned out
to have sanctioned murder

70
00:02:25,359 --> 00:02:28,211
without my knowledge and let me
take the hit, I would.

71
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:35,651
Hmm.

72
00:02:35,703 --> 00:02:39,622
Well...like it or not,
you're in the foxhole with me.

73
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:42,409
So order a glass
of your Macallan 20-pretentious,

74
00:02:42,493 --> 00:02:45,328
and let's figure out how we're
going to fight this together.

75
00:02:51,936 --> 00:02:53,903
You haven't said a word
all night.

76
00:02:53,971 --> 00:02:55,305
Are we going to talk
about this or not?

77
00:02:55,372 --> 00:02:56,806
What is there
to talk about?

78
00:02:56,857 --> 00:02:58,297
This is why you didn't want
to decide

79
00:02:58,308 --> 00:03:00,076
whether to live with me
or not, right?

80
00:03:00,144 --> 00:03:01,644
Well, it isn't,
actually,

81
00:03:01,712 --> 00:03:03,680
but you knew that I was
applying to Stanford,

82
00:03:03,747 --> 00:03:05,448
and you said that you'd support
whatever decision I made.

83
00:03:05,516 --> 00:03:08,218
I did, but then
you got into Columbia,

84
00:03:08,285 --> 00:03:10,587
so I thought
that wouldn't matter anymore.

85
00:03:10,638 --> 00:03:12,172
Because Stanford's
in California,

86
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:14,257
and Columbia's here.
And because Columbia

87
00:03:14,325 --> 00:03:16,509
is an amazing school
and we said we love each other.

88
00:03:16,594 --> 00:03:18,061
Yeah, but it's not
that simple.

89
00:03:18,129 --> 00:03:20,997
It sounds that simple to me.

90
00:03:22,683 --> 00:03:26,586
What I mean is

91
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:28,404
I'm not built
the same as you.

92
00:03:28,472 --> 00:03:30,707
I need to decide
what school is better for me

93
00:03:30,774 --> 00:03:33,276
before factoring in you or us
or anything else.

94
00:03:33,344 --> 00:03:34,761
And how exactly
do you plan on doing that?

95
00:03:34,845 --> 00:03:36,713
The same way that I make
all the important decisions

96
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:39,165
in my life,
by weighing the pros and cons

97
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:40,583
of both schools.

98
00:03:40,651 --> 00:03:42,885
And where does not being
with me rank on that list?

99
00:03:42,937 --> 00:03:44,504
You're missing the point.

100
00:03:44,588 --> 00:03:46,556
I am trying to figure out
which school is best for me

101
00:03:46,623 --> 00:03:48,424
in a vacuum.
No, you're missing the point.

102
00:03:48,476 --> 00:03:50,426
You're trying to figure out
what school is best for you

103
00:03:50,478 --> 00:03:52,261
as though I didn't exist,
but I do.

104
00:03:52,313 --> 00:03:54,030
- Mike--
- Rachel, I'm not saying

105
00:03:54,081 --> 00:03:56,399
that you have to
go to Columbia.

106
00:03:56,467 --> 00:03:59,836
We're adults.
We're together.

107
00:03:59,904 --> 00:04:02,605
At some point, you're going to
have to factor that in too.

108
00:04:06,043 --> 00:04:08,928
- She go for it?
- No, she didn't.

109
00:04:09,013 --> 00:04:10,914
Then if Scottie won't
separate from us amicably,

110
00:04:10,981 --> 00:04:12,282
we'll make her do it
forcibly.

111
00:04:12,349 --> 00:04:14,150
Jessica, I don't want to start
another war with her.

112
00:04:14,218 --> 00:04:15,658
- Then what's your idea?
- My idea is

113
00:04:15,719 --> 00:04:17,921
we act like lawyers
and we fight the lawsuit.

114
00:04:17,988 --> 00:04:19,756
On its merits?

115
00:04:19,823 --> 00:04:22,892
Edward Darby sanctioned murder.
We don't stand a chance.

116
00:04:22,943 --> 00:04:26,095
- Jessica--
- Harvey, you know I'm right,

117
00:04:26,163 --> 00:04:28,214
and it's what you told
Scottie--

118
00:04:28,299 --> 00:04:30,600
it's the truth, and just because
she can't see it

119
00:04:30,668 --> 00:04:31,651
doesn't mean
we have to live with it.

120
00:04:31,735 --> 00:04:32,835
No, we don't.

121
00:04:32,903 --> 00:04:34,303
I need you to get in a room
with Ava

122
00:04:34,305 --> 00:04:36,306
and offer our testimony
against Edward

123
00:04:36,373 --> 00:04:39,192
in exchange for taking our names
off the lawsuit.

124
00:04:40,644 --> 00:04:43,513
What about when Scottie
finds out?

125
00:04:51,055 --> 00:04:52,939
Thanks.

126
00:05:03,194 --> 00:05:04,662
11:08.

127
00:05:04,713 --> 00:05:06,664
For being late
to a settlement conference.

128
00:05:06,731 --> 00:05:08,766
Tanner, what the hell are you
doing here, and how the hell

129
00:05:08,833 --> 00:05:10,851
did you insinuate yourself
with Ava Hessington?

130
00:05:10,936 --> 00:05:12,603
- Jealous?
- No, I just thought Hessington

131
00:05:12,671 --> 00:05:15,406
was in the oil business,
not the snake oil business.

132
00:05:15,474 --> 00:05:16,974
Ha ha.
They diversified.

133
00:05:17,042 --> 00:05:19,877
- Where's Ava?
- Ava's not here,

134
00:05:19,928 --> 00:05:21,479
because she's not interested
in your offer

135
00:05:21,546 --> 00:05:22,980
to testify
against Edward Darby.

136
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:24,431
I'm not the one
who did this to her.

137
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:26,517
Aren't you? Didn't you pull
your typical bullshit

138
00:05:26,585 --> 00:05:28,202
to get the original attorney
thrown off this case?

139
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:30,254
- To win the damn case.
- Well, instead of winning it,

140
00:05:30,322 --> 00:05:31,622
it led to Ava being charged
with murder.

141
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:33,023
A charge I got her off of

142
00:05:33,091 --> 00:05:35,059
by finding the people
who were actually responsible.

143
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:36,527
Sorry, Harv,
but that's not enough,

144
00:05:36,595 --> 00:05:38,863
and Ava has no intention
of letting you off the hook.

145
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:41,148
Ava or you?

146
00:05:41,233 --> 00:05:42,933
We both know
you tracked her down

147
00:05:42,984 --> 00:05:44,952
because of your lifelong,
never-gonna-happen dream

148
00:05:45,036 --> 00:05:46,287
to beat me.
I never heard

149
00:05:46,371 --> 00:05:48,122
of Ava Hessington until
she walked through my door.

150
00:05:48,206 --> 00:05:50,040
Bullshit.
You have a subscription

151
00:05:50,108 --> 00:05:51,825
to Harvey Specter monthly,
and I know it.

152
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:53,661
Okay, you got me.

153
00:05:53,745 --> 00:05:54,879
I knew exactly who she was

154
00:05:54,946 --> 00:05:56,413
the second she walked
through my door--

155
00:05:56,464 --> 00:05:58,382
my chance to take
your lunch money.

156
00:05:58,449 --> 00:06:01,919
Well, let me make you
an advance payment.

157
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:04,288
Why don't you use this

158
00:06:04,339 --> 00:06:06,423
to call your mom and tell her
to get the tissues ready,

159
00:06:06,474 --> 00:06:08,175
because you're 0-2
against me,

160
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:11,862
and the 0 isn't the number

171
00:06:51,264 --> 00:06:52,332
We should have known

172
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:53,618
Tanner was behind
this whole thing.

173
00:06:53,684 --> 00:06:55,017
According to Tanner,

174
00:06:55,085 --> 00:06:56,725
Ava went to him,
not the other way around.

175
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:58,821
- You believe that shit?
- Not for a second.

176
00:06:58,872 --> 00:07:00,189
Who am I putting
in the cross hairs,

177
00:07:00,257 --> 00:07:02,375
Tanner or Ava?
At the moment, no one.

178
00:07:02,459 --> 00:07:04,844
Tanner's going to depose me,
then we'll see what we see.

179
00:07:04,928 --> 00:07:07,697
Come on, Harvey,
you got to give me one of them.

180
00:07:07,764 --> 00:07:09,031
You've got to be
kidding me.

181
00:07:09,099 --> 00:07:11,000
You got girlfriend troubles,
don't you?

182
00:07:11,067 --> 00:07:13,336
Okay, I'm just asking
for an assignment, that's all.

183
00:07:13,387 --> 00:07:15,504
Don't tell me, quarterback
asked her to the prom?

184
00:07:15,555 --> 00:07:17,473
Okay, first of all,
I specifically haven't

185
00:07:17,524 --> 00:07:19,275
bothered you with any of this.
Until now.

186
00:07:19,343 --> 00:07:20,776
I was just asking
for an assignment.

187
00:07:20,844 --> 00:07:22,478
Captain Pinstripe's the one
who brought up the girlfriend,

188
00:07:22,529 --> 00:07:24,347
and second of all,
people actually had girlfriends

189
00:07:24,414 --> 00:07:26,549
after high school,
which you wouldn't know,

190
00:07:26,616 --> 00:07:28,351
because emotionally,
you never graduated.

191
00:07:28,418 --> 00:07:29,919
Well, I guess
you're the expert,

192
00:07:29,987 --> 00:07:32,772
because the only thing you
graduated from is high school.

193
00:07:35,092 --> 00:07:36,942
Why you got to go there,
man?

194
00:07:39,262 --> 00:07:41,263
This predicts
a candidate's success rate,

195
00:07:41,331 --> 00:07:43,466
and then this
cross-references it

196
00:07:43,533 --> 00:07:45,501
with your firm's
employment needs.

197
00:07:45,568 --> 00:07:47,803
Wait a second, you're running
two programs at the same time?

198
00:07:47,871 --> 00:07:49,972
Yeah, I don't bend over
backwards for just anyone.

199
00:07:50,023 --> 00:07:51,457
Hold on to that thought.

200
00:07:51,541 --> 00:07:53,609
In the meantime, I need you
to put this guy on the list.

201
00:07:53,677 --> 00:07:55,127
Uhhuh.
I already did.

202
00:07:55,212 --> 00:07:56,612
Would you
look at this place?

203
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,380
I mean, it's like a war room
in here.

204
00:07:58,432 --> 00:08:02,051
Mmhmm.
Speaking of wartime,

205
00:08:02,119 --> 00:08:04,420
I'm in the mood
to do battle in the bedroom.

206
00:08:04,488 --> 00:08:06,555
- Not now!
- Oh.

207
00:08:06,623 --> 00:08:08,090
Muddles my mind.
I need to focus.

208
00:08:08,158 --> 00:08:10,626
I get it, you want
to keep looking at candidates.

209
00:08:10,694 --> 00:08:11,977
Yeah.

210
00:08:12,062 --> 00:08:14,830
Check out this bad boy
right here.

211
00:08:16,133 --> 00:08:17,666
- Where'd you get this?
- Harvard archives.

212
00:08:17,734 --> 00:08:19,268
Think this guy's
partner material?

213
00:08:19,336 --> 00:08:20,369
I'm ready to go
to the other room.

214
00:08:20,437 --> 00:08:21,670
Thought
that'd do the trick.

215
00:08:21,738 --> 00:08:23,139
We should bring this in,
tape it to the wall.

216
00:08:23,206 --> 00:08:24,767
There's already 50
taped to the ceiling.

217
00:08:24,808 --> 00:08:27,510
You won't be
looking at the ceiling.

218
00:08:27,577 --> 00:08:30,679
You want this guy
to join us?

219
00:08:30,747 --> 00:08:32,915
- We're running out of time.
- Oh.

220
00:08:34,417 --> 00:08:36,819
Tanner's deposing Harvey.
We need to talk about it.

221
00:08:36,886 --> 00:08:39,121
- Who's going to handle it?
- I am.

222
00:08:39,189 --> 00:08:40,510
I don't want to step
on your toes,

223
00:08:40,557 --> 00:08:42,491
but don't we want to consider
outside counsel?

224
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,360
We've gone
down that road before.

225
00:08:44,428 --> 00:08:46,195
Turns out Harvey doesn't
play well with others.

226
00:08:46,246 --> 00:08:47,379
Don't I know it.

227
00:08:47,464 --> 00:08:48,531
But I still think
it's a good idea

228
00:08:48,598 --> 00:08:50,466
to have outside counsel
in that room.

229
00:08:50,534 --> 00:08:51,867
I don't think
it's a good idea

230
00:08:51,935 --> 00:08:53,802
to have anyone else
in that room.

231
00:08:53,854 --> 00:08:55,704
So you brought me in here
to tell me

232
00:08:55,772 --> 00:08:57,089
that you don't want me
to be a part of it?

233
00:08:57,174 --> 00:09:00,209
I brought you in here
to tell you to keep your cool.

234
00:09:00,277 --> 00:09:02,645
I appreciate the condescending
words of wisdom, but I've sat in

235
00:09:02,712 --> 00:09:05,347
on about 1,000 depositions
and I've never broken a sweat.

236
00:09:05,415 --> 00:09:08,050
You've never sat in one
with Travis Tanner.

237
00:09:08,118 --> 00:09:09,618
You're gonna need
a thick skin,

238
00:09:09,686 --> 00:09:11,087
'cause he's gonna try
to get under it.

239
00:09:11,154 --> 00:09:12,888
- I'm not the one being deposed.
- Doesn't matter.

240
00:09:12,956 --> 00:09:14,190
Last time he deposed Harvey,

241
00:09:14,257 --> 00:09:16,125
it ended with Harvey
punching him in the face.

242
00:09:16,193 --> 00:09:17,626
That's Harvey, not me.

243
00:09:17,694 --> 00:09:20,096
And if Harvey hadn't done it,
I might have.

244
00:09:20,147 --> 00:09:21,630
What are you talking about?

245
00:09:21,681 --> 00:09:23,532
Tanner knew
all about Harvey's mother.

246
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,434
Came with a whole story
about how I'm Harvey's mother

247
00:09:25,502 --> 00:09:27,970
and what Harvey wants to do
to his mother,

248
00:09:28,038 --> 00:09:31,841
and that story was bullshit.
I get it.

249
00:09:31,908 --> 00:09:34,477
He's not going to need
a bullshit story with me.

250
00:09:36,346 --> 00:09:39,281
Stanford class schedule
and a list of every flight

251
00:09:39,332 --> 00:09:41,350
from here
to Northern California.

252
00:09:41,418 --> 00:09:44,520
I would get a lot of time off,
and it's really not that far.

253
00:09:44,588 --> 00:09:46,489
So I guess this means
you've made your decision.

254
00:09:46,556 --> 00:09:48,224
Mike, I need you
to listen to me.

255
00:09:48,291 --> 00:09:51,794
I love you.
That's over here.

256
00:09:51,862 --> 00:09:53,262
I need to decide
where I want to go to school.

257
00:09:53,329 --> 00:09:55,531
That's over here.
But I want to be with you

258
00:09:55,599 --> 00:09:57,266
no matter what,
and that's in here.

259
00:09:57,334 --> 00:09:58,334
I'm onboard with that,
Rachel,

260
00:09:58,401 --> 00:10:00,903
there's just one problem.

261
00:10:00,971 --> 00:10:02,938
If you say that long-distance
relationships don't work--

262
00:10:03,006 --> 00:10:04,006
I know,
you don't want to hear it.

263
00:10:04,074 --> 00:10:06,142
Because we're not
most people.

264
00:10:06,209 --> 00:10:07,943
I don't know anyone
that has ever

265
00:10:08,011 --> 00:10:10,980
made a long-distance
relationship work.

266
00:10:11,047 --> 00:10:12,915
Do you?

267
00:10:15,385 --> 00:10:20,022
Mike, I need
to be able to breathe

268
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:21,423
to make this decision.

269
00:10:21,491 --> 00:10:23,725
I'm not the one
that's making it that you can't.

270
00:10:23,777 --> 00:10:26,128
The facts are, but the facts
aren't going to change.

271
00:10:26,196 --> 00:10:30,933
You choose to go to Stanford,
most likely it means we're done.

272
00:10:44,848 --> 00:10:48,918
I don't think you could be
any better than that.

273
00:10:48,969 --> 00:10:52,071
It's like you read my mind.

274
00:10:52,155 --> 00:10:53,622
I have a reward for you.

275
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:55,958
Oh, please, if it's a picture
of me as an astronaut,

276
00:10:56,026 --> 00:10:58,027
I can't right now.
Brian Galloway.

277
00:10:58,094 --> 00:11:01,947
Top of his class, <i>Law Review,</i>
<i>and one cutthroat mother--</i>

278
00:11:02,032 --> 00:11:03,699
Oh, my God,
he's perfect.

279
00:11:05,151 --> 00:11:06,569
You were hiding him
from me?

280
00:11:06,636 --> 00:11:09,305
I've been saving him
for you.

281
00:11:09,372 --> 00:11:15,577
Now, Louis, let's you and I
take the rest of the day off.

282
00:11:15,629 --> 00:11:17,897
- The rest of the day?
- Yeah, we can play hooky.

283
00:11:17,981 --> 00:11:19,498
It'll be fun.

284
00:11:19,583 --> 00:11:24,253
There's a Mastodon exhibit
on loan from Bangkok.

285
00:11:24,304 --> 00:11:25,821
Sheila!
You know that I can't

286
00:11:25,889 --> 00:11:27,122
be unfaithful to my firm
like that.

287
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:28,924
I mean, it's bad enough
we took a 77-minute break

288
00:11:28,992 --> 00:11:30,793
to do what we just did.

289
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:33,028
I understand.

290
00:11:33,096 --> 00:11:34,630
You're dedicated
to your work.

291
00:11:34,698 --> 00:11:38,067
It's one of the things
that I admire about you.

292
00:11:38,134 --> 00:11:40,135
Thank you.

293
00:11:40,203 --> 00:11:44,873
In fact, unless you have
any other candidates for me,

294
00:11:44,941 --> 00:11:46,809
I really have to go.

295
00:11:51,615 --> 00:11:53,599
Thank you.

296
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,590
Donna.

297
00:12:03,293 --> 00:12:05,361
Oh, he's not here.

298
00:12:05,428 --> 00:12:07,696
Is there something
that I can help you with?

299
00:12:07,764 --> 00:12:10,115
Come to think of it,
I'm not one for office gossip,

300
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:13,035
but I have to know.
Are Briscoe and Linhart dating?

301
00:12:13,103 --> 00:12:15,204
Oh, my God,
big time,

302
00:12:15,272 --> 00:12:17,640
and it is drama
with a capital "D."

303
00:12:17,707 --> 00:12:19,141
I knew it.

304
00:12:19,192 --> 00:12:20,909
What about van Giessen
and Schwarz?

305
00:12:20,977 --> 00:12:24,079
Oh, they were,
but it's done-zo.

306
00:12:24,147 --> 00:12:28,784
Van Giessen thinks Schwarz
got too cozy with Boone.

307
00:12:28,852 --> 00:12:31,053
- Tax law Boone?
- Bankruptcy Boone.

308
00:12:31,121 --> 00:12:33,155
- I thought she was gay.
- No, she's not.

309
00:12:33,223 --> 00:12:35,291
What?
I knew you'd know.

310
00:12:35,358 --> 00:12:36,659
I always do.

311
00:12:36,726 --> 00:12:41,080
How long have Mike Ross
and Rachel Zane been dating?

312
00:12:41,164 --> 00:12:42,931
Um, a few months.

313
00:12:42,983 --> 00:12:47,135
- So it's not casual?
- No, it's not.

314
00:12:47,187 --> 00:12:48,737
Which means
he told Robert Zane's daughter

315
00:12:48,805 --> 00:12:49,971
his secret.

316
00:12:50,023 --> 00:12:51,240
Jessica, I know
what you're thinking--

317
00:12:51,307 --> 00:12:53,609
You have no idea
what I'm thinking.

318
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:55,828
But for now, I'm thinking
that you're not going to say

319
00:12:55,912 --> 00:12:59,147
anything about this
to either one of them.

320
00:12:59,199 --> 00:13:00,783
And that's not a request.

321
00:13:00,834 --> 00:13:03,168
I won't say a word.

322
00:13:11,116 --> 00:13:12,887
Jesus, you look like shit.

323
00:13:12,888 --> 00:13:14,922
I was up all night.
I couldn't sleep.

324
00:13:14,974 --> 00:13:16,924
I told you I didn't need
anything on Tanner yet.

325
00:13:16,992 --> 00:13:18,710
I'm not here to talk
about Tanner

326
00:13:18,794 --> 00:13:22,096
or the lawsuit or the merger,
I just...

327
00:13:23,666 --> 00:13:24,932
I want to know
how you do it.

328
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,401
How I do what?

329
00:13:26,468 --> 00:13:28,836
Not let people in.

330
00:13:28,904 --> 00:13:30,505
I need to know.

331
00:13:30,572 --> 00:13:32,407
You don't know
what I do and don't do.

332
00:13:32,474 --> 00:13:34,342
What I know is that
you seem to have relationships

333
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:36,411
again and again
and they don't eat you up

334
00:13:36,478 --> 00:13:39,147
or spit you out
or seem to affect you at all.

335
00:13:39,214 --> 00:13:40,882
I have a picture
of Dorian Gray

336
00:13:40,949 --> 00:13:42,550
hanging in my closet.
It's not funny.

337
00:13:42,618 --> 00:13:44,252
I wasn't joking.
I was trying to get you to leave

338
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,987
so I could have my morning
without you judging me.

339
00:13:46,055 --> 00:13:47,722
Harvey,
I'm not judging you, all right?

340
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:50,425
I'm just--I just need to know
what your mind-set is.

341
00:13:50,492 --> 00:13:52,927
My mind-set is,
I don't talk about it.

342
00:13:52,995 --> 00:13:54,462
I don't want
to talk about it.

343
00:13:54,513 --> 00:13:58,099
I keep my personal here
and my business over there.

344
00:13:58,150 --> 00:13:59,534
I'm happy
that's working for you,

345
00:13:59,601 --> 00:14:02,403
but it doesn't seem
to be working for me.

346
00:14:02,454 --> 00:14:06,441
I wasn't giving you advice.
I was answering your question.

347
00:14:06,508 --> 00:14:07,942
You want advice,
call Dr. Phil.

348
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:10,444
Harvey, I'm not trying
to attack you here, okay?

349
00:14:10,496 --> 00:14:12,146
I'm struggling with something.
I just--

350
00:14:12,214 --> 00:14:13,581
I'm trying to get
your take on it.

351
00:14:13,649 --> 00:14:15,183
And I'm not trying to be
defensive, I'm just telling you

352
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:18,052
I don't know everything
about everything.

353
00:14:19,421 --> 00:14:22,357
Look Mike, you want to know
how to be a lawyer,

354
00:14:22,424 --> 00:14:24,042
I'm your man.

355
00:14:24,126 --> 00:14:26,627
You want to know
how to deal with love,

356
00:14:26,695 --> 00:14:28,963
That's not my area.

357
00:14:29,031 --> 00:14:31,432
There's coffee made
and bagels in the fridge.

358
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,701
Why don't you
take the morning off?

359
00:14:33,752 --> 00:14:36,637
I've got the deposition.
I got to go.

360
00:14:41,777 --> 00:14:43,378
What the hell happened?

361
00:14:43,445 --> 00:14:45,480
Brian Galloway's weighing offers
from seven different firms.

362
00:14:45,547 --> 00:14:48,249
Eight if you count yours.

363
00:14:48,317 --> 00:14:49,884
Why would you
do that to me?

364
00:14:49,935 --> 00:14:51,296
Is this about
the Mastodon exhibit?

365
00:14:51,353 --> 00:14:53,054
No, you're committed
to your work

366
00:14:53,122 --> 00:14:55,623
as I'm committed to mine,
and unless I'm mistaken,

367
00:14:55,691 --> 00:14:58,526
we never made a professional
commitment to each other.

368
00:14:58,594 --> 00:14:59,961
Sheila,
I don't need a commitment

369
00:15:00,028 --> 00:15:01,662
to know that what we have
is special and unique.

370
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:05,400
It's not special,
and it's definitely not unique.

371
00:15:06,735 --> 00:15:08,152
Okay, well, then I'm going to
ask you a question,

372
00:15:08,237 --> 00:15:09,971
and I'm only
going to ask it once.

373
00:15:10,038 --> 00:15:11,873
Do you war room
with other firms?

374
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:13,424
You're a lawyer, Louis.

375
00:15:16,612 --> 00:15:18,880
Don't ask questions
you don't want the answers to.

376
00:15:18,931 --> 00:15:20,815
I'm sorry
you feel that way,

377
00:15:20,882 --> 00:15:22,850
but if you can't handle me
seeing other firms,

378
00:15:22,918 --> 00:15:25,319
then maybe you're not the man
that I thought you were,

379
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:28,439
and maybe you don't deserve
Brian Galloway.

380
00:15:28,524 --> 00:15:29,907
Deserve him?

381
00:15:29,992 --> 00:15:31,358
You don't get to make
that determination.

382
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:34,262
Yes, I do.
I'm Sheila Amanda Sazs,

383
00:15:34,329 --> 00:15:36,531
and if I say
you don't deserve him,

384
00:15:36,598 --> 00:15:39,200
you don't get to have him.
I don't care who you are.

385
00:15:39,268 --> 00:15:40,768
If I want him,
I can have him,

386
00:15:40,819 --> 00:15:42,069
and I'm going to take him
six ways from Sunday

387
00:15:42,121 --> 00:15:43,271
and there's nothing you can do
to stop me.

388
00:15:43,338 --> 00:15:44,505
Yes, there is,

389
00:15:44,573 --> 00:15:46,240
because when I'm done
talking to him,

390
00:15:46,308 --> 00:15:48,943
there's no way on earth he'll
end up at Pearson Darby Specter

391
00:15:49,011 --> 00:15:50,111
or whatever bullshit name

392
00:15:50,179 --> 00:15:53,214
you guys are calling yourselves
this week.

393
00:15:53,282 --> 00:15:56,217
Now, get out of my way.
I have a plane to catch.

394
00:16:03,659 --> 00:16:05,793
- You're early.
- So are you.

395
00:16:05,861 --> 00:16:07,462
I should have known
something like this was coming

396
00:16:07,529 --> 00:16:08,830
when you left
without saying a word.

397
00:16:08,897 --> 00:16:10,932
What did you expect,
a fruit basket

398
00:16:10,999 --> 00:16:13,301
for getting me out of a crime
your firm committed?

399
00:16:13,368 --> 00:16:15,169
Ava, I know Travis Tanner
fed you a line

400
00:16:15,237 --> 00:16:16,318
to get your business, but--

401
00:16:16,371 --> 00:16:18,372
Mr. Tanner
didn't feed me anything.

402
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:21,242
This is the result
of your actions.

403
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:23,494
Wait a second,
you really did go to him?

404
00:16:23,579 --> 00:16:26,581
I looked into you
when I was deciding to hire you.

405
00:16:26,648 --> 00:16:28,149
You think I wouldn't do
the same thing again

406
00:16:28,217 --> 00:16:29,884
when I decided
to come after you?

407
00:16:29,952 --> 00:16:31,452
When you looked into me,

408
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,820
you found out
that whatever I do

409
00:16:32,871 --> 00:16:35,356
I do it to win, and that's all
I ever did for you.

410
00:16:35,424 --> 00:16:36,991
What you did
was intimidate people

411
00:16:37,059 --> 00:16:39,227
and what it did
was backfire onto me.

412
00:16:39,294 --> 00:16:42,296
Well, now I've found someone
you can't intimidate,

413
00:16:42,364 --> 00:16:44,265
and it's backfiring
onto you.

414
00:16:44,332 --> 00:16:45,967
Now, if you'll excuse me,

415
00:16:46,034 --> 00:16:47,335
I don't need to be here
for this.

416
00:16:47,402 --> 00:16:50,838
So you came here
just to vent at me?

417
00:16:50,906 --> 00:16:53,774
I came here to see
if you were at all sorry

418
00:16:53,825 --> 00:16:55,710
about the way
you handled my case.

419
00:16:55,777 --> 00:16:58,980
I see that you aren't.
Though I imagine you will be

420
00:16:59,047 --> 00:17:01,883
once Mr. Tanner
gets through with you.

421
00:17:05,988 --> 00:17:08,122
Feels like old times.

422
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:09,891
Lot of good memories
in this room.

423
00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:11,859
Bring back the taste of blood
in your mouth?

424
00:17:11,927 --> 00:17:14,929
Oh, I'm a shark, Harvey.
I love the taste of blood.

425
00:17:14,997 --> 00:17:16,264
Speaking of which,

426
00:17:16,331 --> 00:17:19,016
when you accepted this case,
did you make a side deal

427
00:17:19,101 --> 00:17:20,902
with Edward Darby
where he agreed to make you

428
00:17:20,969 --> 00:17:23,671
managing partner
over Jessica Pearson if you won?

429
00:17:23,739 --> 00:17:25,072
Yes, I did,

430
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:27,842
but that isn't a side deal.
That's an incentive.

431
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:29,644
What it is
is a conflict of interest.

432
00:17:29,711 --> 00:17:30,978
That is not true.

433
00:17:31,046 --> 00:17:32,813
If anything, it made Harvey
work harder for Ava.

434
00:17:32,881 --> 00:17:34,482
Whatever gets you
through the night.

435
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:36,517
The truth is, Edward Darby
doesn't make that deal

436
00:17:36,568 --> 00:17:39,320
unless you have leverage.
You knew Darby couldn't lose

437
00:17:39,388 --> 00:17:41,122
because Stephen Huntley's
murders would be discovered.

438
00:17:41,189 --> 00:17:42,807
Isn't that correct?
No, it isn't.

439
00:17:42,891 --> 00:17:45,459
So prior to her trial
starting, you didn't know

440
00:17:45,527 --> 00:17:47,295
that Stephen Huntley
orchestrated those murders?

441
00:17:47,362 --> 00:17:48,863
- No, I didn't.
- What if I told you

442
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:51,211
I have evidence that you did?
I'd say you're full of shit.

443
00:17:51,266 --> 00:17:52,466
And whether he knew or not
is irrelevant,

444
00:17:52,517 --> 00:17:54,902
since Edward Darby
stipulated that he knew,

445
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:56,871
making Mr. Specter liable
anyway.

446
00:17:56,939 --> 00:17:58,339
Oh, it's relevant,

447
00:17:58,407 --> 00:18:00,608
because two days ago,
Mr. Specter tried to cut a deal

448
00:18:00,676 --> 00:18:03,744
to split off from Edward Darby
behind your back.

449
00:18:03,812 --> 00:18:06,247
Oh, I see.
Harvey didn't tell you.

450
00:18:06,315 --> 00:18:07,315
If Harvey had told me,

451
00:18:07,382 --> 00:18:08,849
it wouldn't be going
behind my back,

452
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,217
and I'm not going to blame him
for doing what's in his nature

453
00:18:10,285 --> 00:18:12,205
any more than I'd blame you
for being an asshole.

454
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:14,789
Ooh.
Feisty and hot.

455
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,480
Now I get why he can't
stay away from you.

456
00:18:16,558 --> 00:18:19,460
Tanner, last time,
Harvey knocked you out.

457
00:18:19,528 --> 00:18:21,629
You don't start acting
like a human being this time,

458
00:18:21,696 --> 00:18:23,030
you're gonna have to deal
with me.

459
00:18:23,081 --> 00:18:24,732
Hey, I'm not the one
who screwed my old girlfriend

460
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:27,602
while she was engaged.
Kind of a dick move, Harv.

461
00:18:27,669 --> 00:18:28,636
That's enough.

462
00:18:28,704 --> 00:18:30,171
Wait a second.

463
00:18:30,238 --> 00:18:32,073
How come she jumped in,
and you didn't?

464
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:34,742
She didn't tell you
she was engaged.

465
00:18:34,809 --> 00:18:36,243
Can't trust the hot ones.

466
00:18:36,311 --> 00:18:39,080
Come after me, Tanner.
That's what you're here for.

467
00:18:39,147 --> 00:18:42,450
Oh. I get it.
You actually care about her.

468
00:18:44,686 --> 00:18:47,288
I think I've gotten
everything I need right now,

469
00:18:47,356 --> 00:18:49,790
but since it was so much fun,
I'm going to go ahead

470
00:18:49,858 --> 00:18:52,560
and reserve the right
to do this again.

471
00:19:04,206 --> 00:19:07,174
- Hey, do you have a minute?
- Of course.

472
00:19:07,242 --> 00:19:08,722
Just wondering if maybe
you had a copy

473
00:19:08,744 --> 00:19:10,044
of Harvey's deposition.

474
00:19:10,112 --> 00:19:11,746
Can't you just
get one from Harvey?

475
00:19:11,813 --> 00:19:13,693
I could, but then I wouldn't
be able to show you

476
00:19:13,715 --> 00:19:17,468
how I'm letting you
have all your space.

477
00:19:17,552 --> 00:19:19,453
- This is space?
- Yeah, I mean,

478
00:19:19,521 --> 00:19:20,988
I'm all the way over here,

479
00:19:21,056 --> 00:19:24,959
being all space-giving
and adorable.

480
00:19:26,228 --> 00:19:27,962
As opposed to what
you really want to be doing,

481
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:30,498
which is looking
at my pros and cons list

482
00:19:30,565 --> 00:19:34,535
for Columbia and Stanford.
No, it actually isn't.

483
00:19:34,603 --> 00:19:36,303
That list is for you.

484
00:19:36,371 --> 00:19:39,707
It's part of your process,
and I'm gonna respect it.

485
00:19:39,775 --> 00:19:42,343
What changed your mind?

486
00:19:42,411 --> 00:19:44,178
I went to see Harvey
this morning.

487
00:19:44,246 --> 00:19:46,347
Harvey gave you advice?

488
00:19:46,415 --> 00:19:47,948
No.

489
00:19:48,016 --> 00:19:51,385
And yes.

490
00:19:51,453 --> 00:19:55,990
I just realized that if I go
his way, I am gonna lose you.

491
00:19:56,058 --> 00:20:00,361
But if I keep going mine,
I'm gonna push you away.

492
00:20:00,429 --> 00:20:04,899
So make your decision,
and I'll give you your space.

493
00:20:04,966 --> 00:20:07,268
Thank you.

494
00:20:07,335 --> 00:20:11,205
You go to Stanford...
We'll beat the odds.

495
00:20:18,813 --> 00:20:20,247
Son of a bitch.

496
00:20:20,315 --> 00:20:21,999
I'm sorry you had to sit
through that personal attack.

497
00:20:22,084 --> 00:20:23,417
Oh, you think
that's what I'm pissed about?

498
00:20:23,468 --> 00:20:25,636
You tried to cut a deal
that would screw Edward

499
00:20:25,721 --> 00:20:26,887
and me in process.

500
00:20:26,955 --> 00:20:29,774
I tried to include you.
You said no.

501
00:20:29,858 --> 00:20:31,242
Oh, you think
that makes it any better?

502
00:20:31,326 --> 00:20:33,660
Scottie, all this is
is Tanner trying to get us

503
00:20:33,712 --> 00:20:34,862
to fight among ourselves.

504
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:36,597
Well, he's doing
a damn good job of it.

505
00:20:36,648 --> 00:20:38,065
You think he didn't say
some things in there

506
00:20:38,133 --> 00:20:40,484
that got to me too?
Well, I'm not bringing them up,

507
00:20:40,569 --> 00:20:42,486
because right now,
we need to stick together.

508
00:20:42,571 --> 00:20:44,438
Sticking together
means telling the truth,

509
00:20:44,489 --> 00:20:46,407
so tell me, whose idea was it
to cut that deal,

510
00:20:46,474 --> 00:20:48,526
yours or Jessica's?
It was hers,

511
00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:50,027
and I didn't want
to go behind your back

512
00:20:50,112 --> 00:20:51,779
just like you didn't want
to go behind Darby's,

513
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:55,116
but I did because in the end,
I knew I didn't have a choice.

514
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:58,652
And neither do you,
you just haven't seen that yet.

515
00:21:06,261 --> 00:21:08,851
- Mike, I need your help.
- Okay, what is it Louis?

516
00:21:08,856 --> 00:21:10,856
I need to you convince
Brian Galloway to come here.

517
00:21:10,892 --> 00:21:12,376
Who?

518
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:14,511
The top associate candidate
of this year's class.

519
00:21:14,596 --> 00:21:16,396
Stick with me.
Oh, yeah, Brian Galloway.

520
00:21:16,464 --> 00:21:18,265
Harvard,
editor of the <i>Law Review.</i>

521
00:21:18,316 --> 00:21:20,167
Welcome to the conversation.
Please tell me you knew him.

522
00:21:20,235 --> 00:21:21,802
- No, I didn't.
- Damn it!

523
00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:23,904
Louis,
he wasn't my year.

524
00:21:23,972 --> 00:21:25,038
You've already got Katrina.
What's so important

525
00:21:25,106 --> 00:21:26,373
about getting this guy
to come here?

526
00:21:26,441 --> 00:21:28,825
Mike, no, no, no, no, no, no.
It's not about him.

527
00:21:28,910 --> 00:21:30,076
It's about Sheila Sazs.
Oh, yeah?

528
00:21:30,128 --> 00:21:31,895
What about it?
I mean her.

529
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:33,547
Mike, come on,
don't be coy with me.

530
00:21:33,615 --> 00:21:35,883
Everyone in New York knows
about our torrid affair.

531
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:38,185
Yeah, of course.
Torrid.

532
00:21:38,253 --> 00:21:39,753
She had it all set up
for him to come here,

533
00:21:39,821 --> 00:21:41,455
and out of the clear,
blue sky,

534
00:21:41,522 --> 00:21:42,789
she's no longer going to be
exclusive with us.

535
00:21:42,857 --> 00:21:44,524
- There's nothing you did?
- No.

536
00:21:44,592 --> 00:21:47,060
She asked me to take the day
off, I said no.

537
00:21:47,128 --> 00:21:49,062
Next thing I knew she was saying
that our relationship

538
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:51,732
wasn't special and that
she was free to see other firms.

539
00:21:51,799 --> 00:21:53,734
Okay, Louis, I'm sorry,
but is it possible

540
00:21:53,801 --> 00:21:55,285
that this has nothing to do
with work

541
00:21:55,370 --> 00:21:56,637
and what
she's actually saying

542
00:21:56,704 --> 00:21:59,072
is that she wants
to be exclusive with you?

543
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:01,441
Oh, Mike, you're so silly.
You know nothing about women.

544
00:22:01,509 --> 00:22:02,989
If she wanted to be
exclusive with me,

545
00:22:03,044 --> 00:22:04,711
she would just come right out
and say it.

546
00:22:04,779 --> 00:22:06,580
Holy shit, it was staring
at me right in the face.

547
00:22:06,648 --> 00:22:08,582
- Not necessarily.
- I've just been using her

548
00:22:08,650 --> 00:22:11,090
for her candidates, I've just
been wham, bam, candidate ma'am.

549
00:22:11,119 --> 00:22:12,452
- Okay.
- I mean, any woman

550
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:13,520
who's been repeatedly Litt up
would demand

551
00:22:13,588 --> 00:22:14,828
exclusive dominion
over my body.

552
00:22:14,856 --> 00:22:15,989
- Duh.
- Now, get out of my way.

553
00:22:16,057 --> 00:22:17,291
I have a letter to compose.
I'm...

554
00:22:17,358 --> 00:22:19,326
Not in your way.

555
00:22:19,394 --> 00:22:22,079
- Hello, Scottie.
- Tanner.

556
00:22:22,163 --> 00:22:23,830
What are you doing here?

557
00:22:23,881 --> 00:22:25,961
Oh, I just came to bring you
a coffee in the morning.

558
00:22:25,967 --> 00:22:27,768
After meeting you,
I'd say there's an 80% chance

559
00:22:27,835 --> 00:22:30,070
there's a roofie in there.
No roofie.

560
00:22:30,121 --> 00:22:32,172
Just a skinny vanilla latte
with extra whip

561
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,308
and a shot of caramel.

562
00:22:34,375 --> 00:22:36,176
You looked up
my favorite drink?

563
00:22:36,244 --> 00:22:38,712
It's all
part of the package.

564
00:22:38,779 --> 00:22:40,113
You're here
to split me off from Harvey?

565
00:22:40,181 --> 00:22:41,715
Well, he did
the same to you.

566
00:22:41,783 --> 00:22:43,750
And you wouldn't even know
about it if it weren't for me.

567
00:22:43,818 --> 00:22:45,485
You're a regular
Mother Teresa.

568
00:22:45,553 --> 00:22:48,622
Look, I just came to tell you
that we can take it easy on you

569
00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:50,457
if you'll just maybe say
that Harvey

570
00:22:50,525 --> 00:22:52,326
knew about Stephen Huntley
two months ago.

571
00:22:52,393 --> 00:22:53,760
That would be a lie.

572
00:22:53,828 --> 00:22:56,396
Maybe it would just be
conjecture presented as fact.

573
00:22:56,464 --> 00:22:59,282
Look, I'm gonna say
because you already know it.

574
00:22:59,367 --> 00:23:01,084
I betrayed Harvey once.

575
00:23:01,169 --> 00:23:02,602
It's never going to happen
again.

576
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:05,138
Okay, well,
then I'll just have to hear

577
00:23:05,206 --> 00:23:07,741
your side of the story
at your deposition.

578
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:11,345
Ms. Scott,
to your knowledge,

579
00:23:11,412 --> 00:23:13,346
did Harvey Specter
want this merger?

580
00:23:13,398 --> 00:23:14,915
- No, he didn't.
- And did you try

581
00:23:14,983 --> 00:23:16,883
to force it on him
because you'd lost to him

582
00:23:16,951 --> 00:23:18,819
numerous times and you wanted
to get him back?

583
00:23:18,886 --> 00:23:20,737
You're the only one
who's trying to get Harvey back

584
00:23:20,822 --> 00:23:21,989
for losing, Tanner.

585
00:23:22,056 --> 00:23:23,490
And I'm about to be
successful.

586
00:23:23,558 --> 00:23:25,592
Isn't it true
that while you were engaged,

587
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:27,961
you came to New York
and slept with Harvey Specter

588
00:23:28,029 --> 00:23:29,997
in an attempt to get him
to tell you he loved you

589
00:23:30,064 --> 00:23:31,064
and he said no?

590
00:23:31,132 --> 00:23:32,666
That is utter conjecture.

591
00:23:32,734 --> 00:23:34,067
That's why we have
these depositions,

592
00:23:34,135 --> 00:23:36,336
so I can ask questions
about things I'm conjecturing.

593
00:23:36,404 --> 00:23:38,538
You're not asking questions.
You're throwing mud.

594
00:23:38,606 --> 00:23:40,273
Am I?
The facts are,

595
00:23:40,341 --> 00:23:42,309
you had a relationship with him
in law school,

596
00:23:42,377 --> 00:23:43,543
you worked a case
against him,

597
00:23:43,611 --> 00:23:46,046
and shortly thereafter,
ended your relationship.

598
00:23:46,114 --> 00:23:48,315
It doesn't take a rocket
scientist to connect the dots.

599
00:23:48,383 --> 00:23:49,716
- Tanner--
- Did you really think

600
00:23:49,784 --> 00:23:52,319
that you could domesticate him?
A house in Westchester,

601
00:23:52,387 --> 00:23:54,588
Harvey flipping burgers
on the weekends?

602
00:23:54,655 --> 00:23:56,123
What kind of fantasy land
were you living in?

603
00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:57,424
Tanner, that's enough.

604
00:23:57,492 --> 00:23:58,759
She's not answering
this line of questioning.

605
00:23:58,826 --> 00:23:59,960
Then I'll answer it
for her.

606
00:24:00,028 --> 00:24:02,229
You loved him,
he spurned you,

607
00:24:02,296 --> 00:24:04,798
and you set this whole thing up
to get him back.

608
00:24:04,866 --> 00:24:05,932
That's insane.

609
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,168
Which part?
That you loved him?

610
00:24:08,236 --> 00:24:10,637
That he spurned you?

611
00:24:10,705 --> 00:24:13,173
Nothing?
Wow, I guess they're both true.

612
00:24:13,241 --> 00:24:14,562
We're just not
supposed to believe

613
00:24:14,642 --> 00:24:16,203
that you set this merger up
out of anger

614
00:24:16,277 --> 00:24:17,944
because you knew what was
coming down the pike.

615
00:24:18,012 --> 00:24:19,262
I had no idea
what was coming down the pike.

616
00:24:19,347 --> 00:24:21,248
Oh, so you're telling me
that Edward Darby knew

617
00:24:21,315 --> 00:24:22,582
but his number two
didn't know?

618
00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:24,650
I was not the only one
that Edward Darby relied on.

619
00:24:24,652 --> 00:24:26,787
He relied on Stephen Huntley
for what happened in the E.I.R.,

620
00:24:26,854 --> 00:24:30,557
and they both
kept it from me.

621
00:24:30,608 --> 00:24:32,676
Then why am I holding
this affidavit

622
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,040
with Stephen Huntley's name
on it

623
00:24:34,062 --> 00:24:36,263
stating
you knew everything?

624
00:24:36,330 --> 00:24:38,732
Because he's
a lying son of a bitch,

625
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:39,933
and you're a piece of shit,

626
00:24:39,984 --> 00:24:42,536
and this is the end
of this deposition.

627
00:24:52,146 --> 00:24:54,765
What you doing?

628
00:24:54,849 --> 00:24:56,650
You know what I'm doing.

629
00:24:56,717 --> 00:24:58,618
If you want to keep
your mind off Rachel,

630
00:24:58,686 --> 00:25:01,621
try reading
Scottie's deposition.

631
00:25:01,689 --> 00:25:02,956
I did.

632
00:25:03,024 --> 00:25:04,491
That must have been
brutal for her.

633
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:06,693
Must have been brutal
for Harvey.

634
00:25:06,761 --> 00:25:08,912
From what I've seen,
not much is.

635
00:25:08,996 --> 00:25:11,815
Mike, he's not as hard
as you think.

636
00:25:14,035 --> 00:25:15,635
Why are you talking to me
about this?

637
00:25:15,703 --> 00:25:17,637
Because if I asked Harvey
what I'm about to ask you--

638
00:25:17,705 --> 00:25:20,039
He'd say no.

639
00:25:20,091 --> 00:25:21,208
I want to talk to Stephen.

640
00:25:21,275 --> 00:25:23,643
- Donna, not a good idea.
- Mike, please.

641
00:25:23,711 --> 00:25:25,011
I can't just let him hurt
somebody else

642
00:25:25,079 --> 00:25:26,346
and do nothing about it.

643
00:25:26,414 --> 00:25:27,848
So this is just
about protecting Scottie?

644
00:25:27,915 --> 00:25:29,155
I'm not just
protecting Scottie.

645
00:25:29,217 --> 00:25:30,350
I'm protecting Harvey,

646
00:25:30,418 --> 00:25:33,753
because he may not know
how he feels, but I do.

647
00:25:39,343 --> 00:25:41,962
I was told my attorney
was here to see me.

648
00:25:42,013 --> 00:25:45,499
I'm sorry, should have said
"an attorney's here to see you."

649
00:25:45,566 --> 00:25:48,368
You lied, so we lied.

650
00:25:48,419 --> 00:25:53,240
See you got my affidavit.
Well written, wouldn't you say?

651
00:25:53,291 --> 00:25:54,541
So is <i>Lord of the Rings,</i>

652
00:25:54,609 --> 00:25:57,444
but you know what they both are?
Fiction.

653
00:25:57,512 --> 00:25:59,746
What did Tanner offer you
to sign that?

654
00:25:59,814 --> 00:26:01,381
He didn't offer me
anything.

655
00:26:01,449 --> 00:26:03,250
Bullshit.
Tanner's a liar and a snake

656
00:26:03,317 --> 00:26:05,218
and he doesn't do anything
without a reason.

657
00:26:05,286 --> 00:26:06,647
So you say,
but I wouldn't know him

658
00:26:06,671 --> 00:26:08,321
from a hole in the ground.

659
00:26:08,389 --> 00:26:10,056
He came to me
with an opportunity,

660
00:26:10,124 --> 00:26:11,658
and I took it.

661
00:26:11,726 --> 00:26:13,727
How is making up
a load of shit about Dana Scott

662
00:26:13,794 --> 00:26:15,629
an opportunity?
I didn't make up anything.

663
00:26:15,696 --> 00:26:17,497
What I wrote was that
she was the conduit

664
00:26:17,565 --> 00:26:19,015
between Edward and I.

665
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:21,952
She was my boss.
That is factually correct.

666
00:26:22,036 --> 00:26:25,038
That's a misleading statement
designed to confuse a jury

667
00:26:25,106 --> 00:26:27,307
in your murder trial
so that you can claim

668
00:26:27,375 --> 00:26:30,177
Edward's testimony is a lie.
It is a lie.

669
00:26:30,244 --> 00:26:32,829
We never had the conversation
he said we had.

670
00:26:32,914 --> 00:26:36,950
Mike.
Can you give us a minute?

671
00:26:45,176 --> 00:26:46,643
You told me I was wrong

672
00:26:46,727 --> 00:26:48,161
about you.
How can you do this?

673
00:26:48,229 --> 00:26:52,365
Donna,
my life is on the line.

674
00:26:52,433 --> 00:26:53,483
So you'll drag
as many people down

675
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:54,808
as you have to
to save yourself?

676
00:26:54,869 --> 00:26:56,536
Her freedom
isn't at stake.

677
00:26:56,604 --> 00:26:58,271
No,
but her reputation is.

678
00:26:58,339 --> 00:26:59,706
She'll survive.

679
00:26:59,774 --> 00:27:03,610
You're lying about her.

680
00:27:03,678 --> 00:27:06,913
Yeah, I am.

681
00:27:08,883 --> 00:27:12,135
Stephen, I'm gonna
ask you this one more time.

682
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:16,522
If anything you ever said to me
was true, please don't do this.

683
00:27:20,094 --> 00:27:23,396
I'm sorry, Donna.
I have to.

684
00:27:31,956 --> 00:27:34,624
- You get what we need?
- No, she didn't.

685
00:27:34,709 --> 00:27:36,242
Actually, I did.

686
00:27:36,294 --> 00:27:37,877
What are you talking about?

687
00:27:37,929 --> 00:27:40,297
You might not know this,
but every conversation

688
00:27:40,381 --> 00:27:43,249
in this particular facility
is recorded,

689
00:27:43,301 --> 00:27:45,602
with an exception made
for attorney-client privilege.

690
00:27:45,686 --> 00:27:48,605
And as you pointed out,
we're not your attorneys.

691
00:28:29,282 --> 00:28:30,360
Jessica.

692
00:28:30,385 --> 00:28:31,625
Were you expecting
someone else?

693
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:35,412
- I--um--.
- - Nice place. Can I come in?

694
00:28:35,463 --> 00:28:37,014
Yeah, of course.

695
00:28:37,081 --> 00:28:38,549
Do you want some Cheerios?

696
00:28:38,617 --> 00:28:41,318
- What would Cap'n Crunch say?
- Yeah, you're right.

697
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:43,520
We wouldn't want
to cross him.

698
00:28:43,572 --> 00:28:46,023
I've never seen you wear this
at the office.

699
00:28:46,091 --> 00:28:48,626
Something I should know?
Yeah, that's not-

700
00:28:48,693 --> 00:28:50,895
I know,
and I know whose it is,

701
00:28:50,962 --> 00:28:53,097
and that's exactly why
I'm here.

702
00:28:53,164 --> 00:28:56,267
You told Robert Zane's daughter
my business.

703
00:29:00,872 --> 00:29:03,440
Look, she's not gonna
tell anyone.

704
00:29:03,508 --> 00:29:06,777
I know.

705
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:09,647
Because you're going to get her
to sign this.

706
00:29:15,887 --> 00:29:18,088
This puts her in jeopardy.

707
00:29:18,156 --> 00:29:21,892
You put her in jeopardy.

708
00:29:21,943 --> 00:29:25,679
And if I won't do it?

709
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:28,632
Then you won't be working
for me anymore.

710
00:29:30,335 --> 00:29:32,736
- I got your letter.
- And?

711
00:29:32,804 --> 00:29:34,371
You drafted
a legal document.

712
00:29:34,422 --> 00:29:36,540
That outlines
my exclusivity proposal.

713
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:38,842
This is
the least romantic thing ever.

714
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:41,078
You couldn't have the courtesy
to do it in person?

715
00:29:41,146 --> 00:29:43,026
I sent it FedEx, Sheila.
It got there overnight.

716
00:29:43,048 --> 00:29:44,014
P.M. delivery.

717
00:29:44,082 --> 00:29:45,633
A.M. delivery is a scam,
Sheila.

718
00:29:45,717 --> 00:29:47,017
It gets there
at the same time anyway.

719
00:29:47,085 --> 00:29:48,953
Okay, you know what's a scam?
This letter,

720
00:29:49,004 --> 00:29:52,022
which I am now ripping up.

721
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:53,407
No!
Sheila, please!

722
00:29:54,526 --> 00:29:55,926
I labored over every word
of that.

723
00:29:55,994 --> 00:30:00,831
The time for words is over.
The time for deeds is now.

724
00:30:00,899 --> 00:30:02,733
Well, then give me a deed,
I'll do it.

725
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:04,368
Give me a mountain,
I'll climb it.

726
00:30:04,436 --> 00:30:06,020
Gimme a Katy Perry song,
I'll sing it.

727
00:30:06,104 --> 00:30:08,339
Your only deed is for you
to get off the phone

728
00:30:08,406 --> 00:30:10,341
and figure out where I'll be
tomorrow night

729
00:30:10,408 --> 00:30:12,843
so you can tell me
what you need to tell me.

730
00:30:12,911 --> 00:30:15,279
Okay, can I just have
some sort of--

731
00:30:15,347 --> 00:30:17,848
Hello?

732
00:30:19,951 --> 00:30:22,119
Good to see you,
Tanner.

733
00:30:22,187 --> 00:30:23,921
Hello, Harvey.

734
00:30:23,972 --> 00:30:25,622
What do you got
in your hand there?

735
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:27,210
It's an arrest warrant
for your father.

736
00:30:27,225 --> 00:30:29,860
Turns out he did a little
insider trading a few years ago,

737
00:30:29,927 --> 00:30:31,495
and I pulled some strings.

738
00:30:31,563 --> 00:30:35,532
- Bullshit.
- You're right, I'm lying,

739
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,768
just like Stephen Huntley did
on his affidavit,

740
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:38,836
and we've got proof.

741
00:30:38,903 --> 00:30:40,604
Well, look who decided
to show up.

742
00:30:40,671 --> 00:30:42,873
I was waiting for you
to get some points on the board.

743
00:30:42,941 --> 00:30:44,221
Now we can start
having some fun.

744
00:30:44,275 --> 00:30:46,477
Nice try, Tanner,
but that affidavit was bullshit,

745
00:30:46,544 --> 00:30:48,946
now you got nothing to back up
your bullshit on Scottie.

746
00:30:49,014 --> 00:30:50,114
You think I need backup?

747
00:30:50,165 --> 00:30:51,815
It wasn't about her.
It was about you.

748
00:30:51,883 --> 00:30:53,617
I'm going to drag her ass
through the mud

749
00:30:53,668 --> 00:30:55,786
left, right, and center,
and when I'm done with her,

750
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:59,289
there's not a firm that'll
touch her with a 10-foot pole.

751
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:01,780
What the hell happened to you?
Why are you doing this, Tanner?

752
00:31:01,793 --> 00:31:03,210
I'm doing it for my client.

753
00:31:03,294 --> 00:31:05,162
You actually had me thinking
if we ever met again--

754
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:06,363
That I'd fight fair?

755
00:31:06,431 --> 00:31:08,866
I do in the ring,
but this isn't the ring,

756
00:31:08,933 --> 00:31:12,202
and you know very well that you
can stop me anytime you want.

757
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:13,537
If I settle.

758
00:31:13,588 --> 00:31:15,773
There are lot of zeroes
on that offer.

759
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,375
You just need to decide whether
you care more about money

760
00:31:18,443 --> 00:31:21,278
or your girlfriend.

761
00:31:35,910 --> 00:31:38,362
Donna told me that Stephen's
affidavit is dead.

762
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:41,498
It is, but it doesn't matter,
because Tanner's

763
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:44,802
gonna keep coming after you
unless we sign this.

764
00:31:46,071 --> 00:31:47,387
You'll never sign this.

765
00:31:47,472 --> 00:31:49,306
Scottie,
you may not believe this,

766
00:31:49,374 --> 00:31:52,042
but if the decision were mine,
I would.

767
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:54,545
Jessica--
she wouldn't even consider it.

768
00:31:54,612 --> 00:31:56,013
I should have known.

769
00:31:56,081 --> 00:31:58,348
This is about you getting me
to split you off from Edward

770
00:31:58,416 --> 00:32:00,184
so you can convince Ava
to stop coming after you.

771
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:02,820
- This isn't about that.
- Then what is it about?

772
00:32:02,887 --> 00:32:05,222
I can't stand to see them
come after you.

773
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:06,530
- Bullshit!
- It's not bullshit.

774
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:07,724
You think I can't take it!

775
00:32:07,792 --> 00:32:09,476
Look, you're not listening
to me, okay?

776
00:32:09,561 --> 00:32:11,962
I can't take it!

777
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:14,698
Scottie, Tanner can only
come after you

778
00:32:14,765 --> 00:32:16,567
if Ava lets him
come after you,

779
00:32:16,634 --> 00:32:18,795
and Ava's only letting him
come after you to get to me.

780
00:32:18,803 --> 00:32:20,404
Take off the shackles off
and let me convince her

781
00:32:20,472 --> 00:32:22,573
this fight isn't with me,
it's with Edward.

782
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,641
Okay, Harvey.

783
00:32:24,692 --> 00:32:27,044
Okay, you win.

784
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:32,382
Shackles are off.

785
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:36,870
- Hi.
- Hey.

786
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:41,141
There's something that I need
to tell you, and...

787
00:32:41,226 --> 00:32:43,861
I really don't want to.

788
00:32:43,928 --> 00:32:47,147
Okay.
You're scaring me.

789
00:32:47,232 --> 00:32:49,399
Jessica came by my place
this morning.

790
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:52,402
- She knows about us.
- She does.

791
00:32:52,453 --> 00:32:53,937
Okay.

792
00:32:54,005 --> 00:32:55,639
She says that you're
Robert Zane's daughter,

793
00:32:55,690 --> 00:32:59,409
and if you want
to stay at the firm...

794
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:02,146
You need to sign
an affidavit.

795
00:33:02,213 --> 00:33:05,599
Saying what?

796
00:33:05,683 --> 00:33:08,552
That you know I'm a fraud.

797
00:33:11,089 --> 00:33:13,457
Well, what if
I don't sign it?

798
00:33:13,525 --> 00:33:15,742
Then she'll fire me.

799
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:18,946
I don't believe that.
You've got leverage.

800
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:22,449
No, that just stops her
from exposing me, not firing me.

801
00:33:22,534 --> 00:33:24,785
- Bullshit.
- No, it's not bullshit.

802
00:33:24,869 --> 00:33:27,788
If she fires me, what am I
gonna to do, run to the D.A.?

803
00:33:27,872 --> 00:33:30,073
Have them throw me in jail
just to get her back?

804
00:33:30,124 --> 00:33:33,377
I'm not going to do that,
and she knows it.

805
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:45,522
Can't stand that I put you
in this position.

806
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:48,442
And the only way I can see
out of this is...

807
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:50,811
for you to go to Stanford.

808
00:33:53,237 --> 00:33:56,088
Miss Hessington, when we first met

809
00:33:56,745 --> 00:33:58,779
did you admit
you bribed a foreign government

810
00:33:58,847 --> 00:33:59,847
to get your pipeline?

811
00:33:59,915 --> 00:34:01,382
I pled guilty.

812
00:34:01,450 --> 00:34:03,751
I didn't ask you
what you pled.

813
00:34:03,819 --> 00:34:05,920
I asked if you did it.
That's privileged.

814
00:34:05,988 --> 00:34:08,256
Your client forfeited
privilege when she sued me.

815
00:34:08,323 --> 00:34:09,423
Keep that in mind.

816
00:34:09,491 --> 00:34:10,591
My client's not suing you.

817
00:34:10,659 --> 00:34:12,360
She's suing
Pearson Darby Specter.

818
00:34:12,427 --> 00:34:15,129
There is no
Pearson Darby Specter.

819
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:16,664
We split.

820
00:34:16,732 --> 00:34:18,149
Edward Darby
wouldn't allow that.

821
00:34:18,233 --> 00:34:20,074
Edward Darby doesn't have
the power to stop it.

822
00:34:20,135 --> 00:34:22,536
But I do, and I'm not going to
let you make them suffer

823
00:34:22,604 --> 00:34:25,106
for what Darby did.
Hell of a performance, Harvey.

824
00:34:25,173 --> 00:34:26,574
Back-up singers
and everything.

825
00:34:26,642 --> 00:34:27,758
It's still not
going to stop us.

826
00:34:27,843 --> 00:34:30,177
And he isn't
making them suffer.

827
00:34:30,245 --> 00:34:31,846
I am
for what he did to me.

828
00:34:31,914 --> 00:34:34,649
Did what to you?
Get you a slap on the wrist

829
00:34:34,716 --> 00:34:35,850
for your original
bribery charges,

830
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:37,818
get you off murder,

831
00:34:37,886 --> 00:34:39,453
or stop you
from bribing witnesses?

832
00:34:39,521 --> 00:34:41,255
Which brings me
to my next question.

833
00:34:41,323 --> 00:34:43,491
Did you fire me
for refusing to bribe witnesses

834
00:34:43,542 --> 00:34:44,825
on your behalf?

835
00:34:44,893 --> 00:34:47,128
- You're under oath.
- Don't answer that.

836
00:34:47,195 --> 00:34:48,963
I wouldn't.
It's a federal crime.

837
00:34:49,031 --> 00:34:50,931
She doesn't have to.
Like I said,

838
00:34:50,983 --> 00:34:53,901
we're not bound by privilege
and I've got three witnesses,

839
00:34:53,969 --> 00:34:55,436
including your friend
Stephen Huntley

840
00:34:55,504 --> 00:34:57,622
who testified to it
in open court.

841
00:34:57,706 --> 00:35:00,708
You want to throw stones, Ava?
We've got some rocks of our own.

842
00:35:07,449 --> 00:35:08,949
What are you doing,
Harvey?

843
00:35:09,001 --> 00:35:10,885
I'm talking to your client
off the record.

844
00:35:10,936 --> 00:35:12,720
No, no, no.
On the record, or not at all.

845
00:35:12,788 --> 00:35:13,955
No, let him speak.

846
00:35:14,022 --> 00:35:17,858
I want to hear
what he's got to say.

847
00:35:17,926 --> 00:35:20,995
Ava, you can come at us
and we can come at you.

848
00:35:22,864 --> 00:35:26,100
I don't want that.

849
00:35:26,168 --> 00:35:29,337
You wanted to know if I'm sorry.
I am.

850
00:35:29,404 --> 00:35:32,506
I'm sorry
I didn't listen to you,

851
00:35:32,574 --> 00:35:34,241
I'm sorry
I didn't believe you,

852
00:35:34,309 --> 00:35:36,844
I am sorry that my history
with Cameron

853
00:35:36,912 --> 00:35:38,412
put a target on your back,

854
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:41,349
but I am not sorry that I did
everything in my power

855
00:35:41,416 --> 00:35:43,351
to help you
every chance I got.

856
00:35:43,418 --> 00:35:45,519
If you don't believe that,
then keep coming.

857
00:35:45,587 --> 00:35:50,291
But if you do, I'm asking,
put your anger where it belongs.

858
00:35:57,899 --> 00:36:01,819
Tanner, I hope you still have
that quarter I gave you,

859
00:36:01,903 --> 00:36:04,355
'cause I think it's time
to call your mom.

860
00:36:04,439 --> 00:36:07,408
Harvey.

861
00:36:07,476 --> 00:36:10,878
Fantastic.

862
00:36:24,459 --> 00:36:26,060
I hear we won.

863
00:36:26,128 --> 00:36:27,795
We hit a single.
Just kidding.

864
00:36:27,862 --> 00:36:29,714
We knocked the son of a bitch
out of the park.

865
00:36:29,798 --> 00:36:31,866
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations to you.

866
00:36:31,933 --> 00:36:34,335
I hear you're representing
Stephen Huntley now.

867
00:36:34,402 --> 00:36:37,538
Yeah.
Might as well be.

868
00:36:37,606 --> 00:36:39,140
What's that
supposed to mean?

869
00:36:39,207 --> 00:36:41,475
It means we sat and had drinks
when we thought Ava was guilty.

870
00:36:41,526 --> 00:36:43,744
Now Stephen is.
What's the difference?

871
00:36:43,812 --> 00:36:45,880
Guess your morning off
didn't do the trick.

872
00:36:45,947 --> 00:36:48,182
What are we doing here,
Harvey?

873
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:51,085
We spend every minute
of our lives in this office

874
00:36:51,153 --> 00:36:53,087
fighting with each other
over meaningless shit

875
00:36:53,155 --> 00:36:54,655
for clients
that we don't even know,

876
00:36:54,723 --> 00:36:56,323
and then when some
real connection comes along,

877
00:36:56,391 --> 00:36:58,926
just some little piece
of happiness--

878
00:37:08,566 --> 00:37:10,420
Mike.

879
00:37:12,524 --> 00:37:15,409
I'm sorry.

880
00:37:20,549 --> 00:37:22,583
Did she tell you
what she did?

881
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:24,819
Rachel?

882
00:37:24,886 --> 00:37:28,489
I guess not.

883
00:37:28,557 --> 00:37:30,257
Jessica's basically forcing her
to go to Stanford

884
00:37:30,325 --> 00:37:32,026
instead of Columbia.

885
00:37:32,094 --> 00:37:33,928
She found out
about you two.

886
00:37:33,995 --> 00:37:36,931
I don't want her to go.

887
00:37:36,998 --> 00:37:39,767
And there's nothing
I can do about it.

888
00:37:48,076 --> 00:37:49,610
Come in.

889
00:37:53,148 --> 00:37:56,951
I want to talk to you about...
This.

890
00:37:58,420 --> 00:37:59,703
I see you haven't
signed it.

891
00:37:59,788 --> 00:38:01,822
No, I haven't.

892
00:38:01,890 --> 00:38:03,958
Then you must want something,
because you wouldn't be here

893
00:38:04,025 --> 00:38:05,659
just to tell me
you weren't going to sign it.

894
00:38:05,727 --> 00:38:07,628
Mike said you were worried
that Robert Zane's daughter

895
00:38:07,696 --> 00:38:11,332
knew his secret, which got me
thinking about my father

896
00:38:11,399 --> 00:38:13,200
and something
he's always said.

897
00:38:13,268 --> 00:38:14,885
- Which is?
- Don't sign anything

898
00:38:14,970 --> 00:38:16,837
unless you can get something
in return.

899
00:38:16,905 --> 00:38:19,540
- It's called consideration.
- I know what it's called.

900
00:38:23,995 --> 00:38:26,263
What do you want?

901
00:38:26,348 --> 00:38:29,316
You want me to guarantee
that I won't do something

902
00:38:29,384 --> 00:38:30,951
that I would never do.

903
00:38:31,019 --> 00:38:32,979
I want you to guarantee
that you will do something

904
00:38:33,021 --> 00:38:37,024
that you thought you would
never do but should do.

905
00:38:37,091 --> 00:38:39,126
I can't wait to hear this.

906
00:38:39,194 --> 00:38:40,354
Waive the Harvard rule
for me.

907
00:38:40,395 --> 00:38:42,663
- You're not even a lawyer.
- But I will be,

908
00:38:42,731 --> 00:38:44,865
and when I am,
I want to work here.

909
00:38:44,933 --> 00:38:46,567
The Harvard rule

910
00:38:46,634 --> 00:38:48,569
is the longest-standing rule
we have.

911
00:38:48,636 --> 00:38:52,356
I have been killing it here
for the better part of a decade.

912
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:54,608
I'm better than most of
the associates in that bullpen

913
00:38:54,676 --> 00:38:56,877
and I haven't even
gone to law school yet,

914
00:38:56,945 --> 00:38:59,446
so imagine what it'll be like
once I have.

915
00:38:59,514 --> 00:39:01,949
You are
your father's daughter.

916
00:39:02,017 --> 00:39:03,784
Yes, I am.

917
00:39:03,852 --> 00:39:05,402
But I don't want to work
for him.

918
00:39:05,487 --> 00:39:08,322
I want to work for you.

919
00:39:13,494 --> 00:39:15,062
To kicking
Travis Tanner's ass.

920
00:39:15,113 --> 00:39:19,300
You got that right.

921
00:39:19,367 --> 00:39:23,254
Mmm.
A pretty great meal.

922
00:39:23,338 --> 00:39:25,339
Couldn't have done it
without you.

923
00:39:25,406 --> 00:39:27,808
I know, I taught you
how to make it.

924
00:39:27,876 --> 00:39:30,544
Right after we crushed
the bar.

925
00:39:30,612 --> 00:39:34,515
I also remember
what happened later that night.

926
00:39:34,582 --> 00:39:37,484
It was
a pretty great night.

927
00:39:40,005 --> 00:39:43,257
Harvey.

928
00:39:43,325 --> 00:39:44,692
Why am I here?

929
00:39:44,759 --> 00:39:48,028
Well, I haven't cooked
anyone dinner for a while,

930
00:39:48,096 --> 00:39:49,930
and I thought you deserved it.
I did,

931
00:39:49,998 --> 00:39:51,565
but you've made it clear
that you don't want more,

932
00:39:51,633 --> 00:39:54,635
and I don't want to go back
to the way it was, so...

933
00:39:54,703 --> 00:39:57,537
I want to work with you.

934
00:39:58,607 --> 00:40:01,375
What?

935
00:40:01,442 --> 00:40:03,978
You've been associated
with the name Darby too long.

936
00:40:04,045 --> 00:40:05,212
I can help you.

937
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,830
I don't need your help.
I'll be fine.

938
00:40:06,915 --> 00:40:08,949
No, you won't,
and all that stuff about Tanner

939
00:40:09,017 --> 00:40:11,051
coming after you and me
not being able to take it,

940
00:40:11,102 --> 00:40:13,187
it was true.
I care about you.

941
00:40:13,255 --> 00:40:16,790
Come to Pearson Specter.
I know that you care about me.

942
00:40:16,858 --> 00:40:18,392
You have made that
very clear,

943
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:19,760
but I am not interested

944
00:40:19,828 --> 00:40:21,468
in working with someone
day in and day out

945
00:40:21,496 --> 00:40:24,598
where all they can manage to say
is, "I care about you."

946
00:40:24,666 --> 00:40:26,033
- Is that all I've ever said?
- Actually, yes,

947
00:40:26,101 --> 00:40:28,936
over and over again,
"I care about you."

948
00:40:28,987 --> 00:40:30,704
Just what every girl
wants to hear.

949
00:40:30,772 --> 00:40:33,173
- Scottie, that's--
- No, no, no.

950
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:40,581
If all you want to do
is work with me,

951
00:40:40,649 --> 00:40:42,249
I can find a job
somewhere else.

952
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:44,218
It's the best I--

953
00:40:46,121 --> 00:40:47,888
Sorry, I should just go.
I don't--

954
00:40:47,955 --> 00:40:53,027
Scottie,
that's not all I want.

955
00:40:53,094 --> 00:40:56,330
Then say it.

956
00:40:56,398 --> 00:40:58,632
I want you in my life.

957
00:41:05,607 --> 00:41:08,442
- Hi.
- Hi.

958
00:41:08,510 --> 00:41:10,177
Thought you didn't like
coming down here.

959
00:41:10,245 --> 00:41:14,014
- Can I come in?
- Yeah, of course.

960
00:41:24,642 --> 00:41:27,661
I finished my list.

961
00:41:27,729 --> 00:41:29,129
And?

962
00:41:29,197 --> 00:41:32,399
Stanford.

963
00:41:32,467 --> 00:41:35,703
It's the better fit.

964
00:41:35,770 --> 00:41:37,171
Rachel, look--

965
00:41:43,244 --> 00:41:45,612
I don't need a list
to tell me

966
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:48,499
that I don't want to be
without you.

967
00:41:51,653 --> 00:41:53,087
You're staying?

968
00:41:53,154 --> 00:41:55,021
Just try and stop me.

969
00:42:00,628 --> 00:42:01,995
You were messing with me.

970
00:42:02,047 --> 00:42:03,130
- You got me.
- I got...

971
00:42:03,181 --> 00:42:04,331
You!
You got me!

972
00:42:18,279 --> 00:42:19,813
How did you find me?

973
00:42:19,864 --> 00:42:23,550
You're like me,
a gladiator of your profession,

974
00:42:23,618 --> 00:42:27,054
and...
This is your arena.

975
00:42:30,358 --> 00:42:36,263
This place has every
Harvard law student file ever.

976
00:42:36,331 --> 00:42:38,632
It's like home for me.

977
00:42:38,683 --> 00:42:43,036
And...It's where
you wanted me to say...

978
00:42:43,104 --> 00:42:47,341
Sheila Amanda Sazs,
I want to be exclusive with you.

979
00:42:48,910 --> 00:42:51,044
And I want to be exclusive
with you.

980
00:42:51,112 --> 00:42:54,415
Yes.

981
00:42:54,482 --> 00:42:56,827
Yes.

982
00:42:58,787 --> 00:43:01,488
A thousand times yes.

983
00:43:03,741 --> 00:43:05,526
We're gonna make love.
And eat this picnic.

984
00:43:05,593 --> 00:43:07,127
In no particular order.

985
00:43:07,178 --> 00:43:10,197
Wait.
First, I'm gonna call my mother.

986
00:43:10,265 --> 00:43:11,598
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

987
00:43:11,666 --> 00:43:13,117
To tell her the good news?

988
00:43:13,201 --> 00:43:15,068
To tell her
you stopped being a pussy.

989
00:43:15,136 --> 00:43:19,406
Do not touch
any of the files in here.

990
00:43:19,457 --> 00:43:21,041
- Will you smack me if I do?
- Louis,

991
00:43:21,109 --> 00:43:23,110
this is not a joke.

992
00:43:23,178 --> 00:43:25,979
You're not even
supposed to be in here.

993
00:43:45,517 --> 00:43:48,635
For the love of God,
forgive me, Sheila.

994
00:43:50,071 --> 00:43:51,321
You gotta be kidding me.

995
00:43:51,406 --> 00:43:55,576
Harvey Specter.

996
00:43:55,643 --> 00:43:57,528
What a douche.

997
00:43:57,612 --> 00:43:59,530
Mike Ross.

998
00:44:01,583 --> 00:44:04,668
R-o, r-o, r-o.
"R-o."

999
00:44:08,823 --> 00:44:14,044
"Richardson...
Jerry Ross"...

1000
00:44:14,128 --> 00:44:17,047
Mike Ross.
What the hell?

1001
00:44:21,803 --> 00:44:24,721
He's not here.
