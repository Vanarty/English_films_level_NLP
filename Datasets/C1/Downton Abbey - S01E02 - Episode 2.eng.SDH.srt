1
00:00:54,262 --> 00:00:56,799
Here we are, ma'am, Crawley House.

2
00:00:58,683 --> 00:01:00,344
For good or ill.

3
00:01:09,818 --> 00:01:12,685
[SIGHS] I still don't see why
I couldn't just refuse it.

4
00:01:12,779 --> 00:01:15,020
There's no mechanism for you to do so.

5
00:01:15,115 --> 00:01:17,607
You will be an earl.
You will inherit the estate.

6
00:01:17,743 --> 00:01:22,112
Of course, you can throw it away
when you have it. That's up to you.

7
00:01:22,789 --> 00:01:24,279
Can I help?

8
00:01:24,374 --> 00:01:27,207
I'm Molesley, sir, your butler and valet.

9
00:01:27,711 --> 00:01:30,129
-Mr. Molesley, I'm afraid...
-May I introduce ourselves?

10
00:01:30,213 --> 00:01:34,127
I am Mrs. Crawley and this is my son,
Mr. Matthew Crawley.

11
00:01:34,885 --> 00:01:36,678
I'll just give Mr. Taylor
a hand with the cases.

12
00:01:36,762 --> 00:01:39,003
-I can...
-Thank you, Molesley.

13
00:01:42,517 --> 00:01:44,724
I won't let them change me.

14
00:01:44,811 --> 00:01:45,937
Why would they want to?

15
00:01:46,021 --> 00:01:48,729
Mother, Lord Grantham has made
the unwelcome discovery

16
00:01:48,815 --> 00:01:52,317
that his heir is a middle-class lawyer
and the son of a middle-class doctor.

17
00:01:52,401 --> 00:01:53,641
Upper middle class.

18
00:01:53,736 --> 00:01:56,530
He wants to limit the damage
by turning me into one of his own kind.

19
00:01:56,614 --> 00:01:59,527
When you met him in London, you liked him.

20
00:01:59,784 --> 00:02:03,652
I simply do not understand
why we are rushing into this.

21
00:02:03,746 --> 00:02:05,737
Matthew Crawley is my heir.

22
00:02:05,831 --> 00:02:08,163
Patrick was your heir,
he never lived here.

23
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:10,419
Patrick was in and out of this house
since the day he was born.

24
00:02:10,503 --> 00:02:13,088
You saw how many of the village
turned out for the service.

25
00:02:13,172 --> 00:02:14,503
But nothing's settled yet.

26
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:17,799
It is settled, my dearest one,
whether you like it or not.

27
00:02:17,885 --> 00:02:19,751
I wouldn't say that.

28
00:02:19,845 --> 00:02:22,462
Not while your mother breathes air.

29
00:02:30,064 --> 00:02:35,558
Oh, Ellen. This is much better than I
thought it would be. You have done well.

30
00:02:35,652 --> 00:02:37,108
Thank you, ma'am.

31
00:02:37,195 --> 00:02:39,280
Would you like this in here, ma'am,
or taken up to your room?

32
00:02:39,364 --> 00:02:41,196
In here, thank you.

33
00:02:41,699 --> 00:02:45,613
So, are you
the whole of our new household?

34
00:02:45,787 --> 00:02:47,903
There's a local girl, ma'am, Beth.

35
00:02:47,997 --> 00:02:50,332
She's to double under-housemaid
and kitchen maid.

36
00:02:50,416 --> 00:02:53,750
-This is ridiculous.
-Thank you very much, Molesley.

37
00:02:53,962 --> 00:02:57,080
-Might we have some tea?
-Very good, ma'am.

38
00:03:02,095 --> 00:03:03,961
-Well, he can go right now.
-Why?

39
00:03:04,055 --> 00:03:08,299
Because we do not need a
butler or a valet, if it comes to that.

40
00:03:08,393 --> 00:03:10,603
We've always managed perfectly well
with a cook and a maid,

41
00:03:10,687 --> 00:03:12,146
and they cannot expect us to alter our...

42
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:15,149
What they expect, Matthew,
is that we won't know how to behave.

43
00:03:15,233 --> 00:03:19,442
So if you don't mind, I would
rather not confirm their expectations.

44
00:03:19,528 --> 00:03:21,769
I have to be myself, Mother.

45
00:03:21,864 --> 00:03:24,697
I'll be no use to anyone
if I can't be myself.

46
00:03:24,783 --> 00:03:29,198
And before they or you get any ideas,
I will choose my own wife.

47
00:03:29,288 --> 00:03:30,580
What on earth do you mean?

48
00:03:30,664 --> 00:03:32,874
Well, they're clearly going to push
one of the daughters at me.

49
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:35,335
They'll have fixed on that
when they heard I was a bachelor.

50
00:03:35,419 --> 00:03:37,205
Lady Mary Crawley.

51
00:03:39,006 --> 00:03:41,373
I do hope I'm not interrupting.

52
00:03:42,217 --> 00:03:45,335
-Lady Mary...
-Cousin Mary, please.

53
00:03:45,429 --> 00:03:49,423
Mama has sent me down to welcome you
and to ask you to dine with us tonight.

54
00:03:49,516 --> 00:03:51,553
Unless you're too tired.

55
00:03:51,643 --> 00:03:53,259
We would be delighted.

56
00:03:53,353 --> 00:03:55,264
Good. Come at 8:00.

57
00:03:55,856 --> 00:03:58,393
Won't you stay and have some tea?

58
00:03:58,525 --> 00:04:02,859
Oh, no, you're far too busy.
And I wouldn't want to push in.

59
00:04:11,412 --> 00:04:13,539
Lynch, I think we'll go back
by the South Lodge.

60
00:04:13,623 --> 00:04:14,704
Very good, my lady.

61
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:17,960
Lady Mary, I hope you didn't
misunderstand me. I was only joking.

62
00:04:18,044 --> 00:04:20,752
Of course. And I agree.

63
00:04:20,838 --> 00:04:23,580
The whole thing is a complete joke.

64
00:04:27,887 --> 00:04:29,555
THOMAS: So what do you think
we'll make of them?

65
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:32,506
I shouldn't think much.
She hasn't even got a lady's maid.

66
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,851
It's not a capital offense.

67
00:04:33,935 --> 00:04:36,061
She's got a maid, her name's Ellen.
She came a day earlier.

68
00:04:36,145 --> 00:04:37,601
She's not a lady's maid.

69
00:04:37,688 --> 00:04:40,983
She's just a housemaid that fastens
hooks and buttons when she has to.

70
00:04:41,067 --> 00:04:43,359
-There's more to it than that, you know.
-MRS PATMORE: Daisy!

71
00:04:43,443 --> 00:04:46,070
We'll want some very precise reporting
when dinner's over.

72
00:04:46,154 --> 00:04:47,697
Are we to treat him as the heir?

73
00:04:47,781 --> 00:04:51,695
Are we heck as like.
A doctor's son from Manchester?

74
00:04:51,785 --> 00:04:53,828
He'll be lucky if he gets a civil word
out of me.

75
00:04:53,912 --> 00:04:56,654
We're all lucky if we get a civil word
out of you.

76
00:04:56,748 --> 00:04:59,831
Gwen, parcel for you.
Came by the evening post.

77
00:04:59,918 --> 00:05:01,829
Thank you, Mr. Carson.

78
00:05:02,253 --> 00:05:05,666
-William.
-Have you seen them yet, Mr. Carson?

79
00:05:05,757 --> 00:05:09,842
By "them" I assume you mean
the new family, in which case, no.

80
00:05:09,928 --> 00:05:12,841
I have that pleasure to look forward to
this evening.

81
00:05:13,765 --> 00:05:16,684
Daisy, did you hear me call
or have you gone selectively deaf?

82
00:05:16,768 --> 00:05:17,849
No, Mrs. Patmore.

83
00:05:17,936 --> 00:05:21,554
Then might I remind you we are preparing
dinner for your future employer.

84
00:05:21,648 --> 00:05:24,857
And if it goes wrong,
I'll be telling them why.

85
00:05:28,904 --> 00:05:32,522
Why are they here at all
when you're going to undo it?

86
00:05:33,409 --> 00:05:36,151
Your father's not convinced
it can be undone.

87
00:05:36,245 --> 00:05:38,077
But you'll still try.

88
00:05:38,205 --> 00:05:40,572
Granny and I are willing to try.

89
00:05:41,166 --> 00:05:42,656
And Papa is not?

90
00:05:42,751 --> 00:05:44,583
We'll bring him round, you'll see.

91
00:05:44,712 --> 00:05:47,830
We're trying to find a lawyer
who'll take in on.

92
00:05:47,923 --> 00:05:50,005
So what are they like?

93
00:05:50,175 --> 00:05:54,840
She's nice enough,
but he's... very full of himself.

94
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:57,592
-Why do you say that?
-Just an impression.

95
00:05:57,683 --> 00:06:00,095
Let's go down
and you can decide for yourself.

96
00:06:03,772 --> 00:06:05,433
Hello again.

97
00:06:05,941 --> 00:06:08,193
It's a pleasure to meet you at last,
Mrs. Crawley.

98
00:06:08,277 --> 00:06:11,940
We're delighted to be here,
aren't we, Matthew?

99
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:13,566
Delighted.

100
00:06:31,966 --> 00:06:33,627
Welcome to Downton.

101
00:06:34,218 --> 00:06:36,710
Thank you. You've been so kind.

102
00:06:37,263 --> 00:06:39,470
What a reception committee.

103
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:44,551
Yes, thank you.

104
00:06:44,645 --> 00:06:47,808
This is Carson. We'd
all be lost without him.

105
00:06:49,567 --> 00:06:52,309
Mama, may I present
Matthew Crawley and Mrs. Crawley.

106
00:06:52,445 --> 00:06:54,776
My mother, Lady Grantham.

107
00:06:56,156 --> 00:06:58,568
What should we call each other?

108
00:06:58,825 --> 00:07:03,069
Well, we could always start with
Mrs. Crawley and Lady Grantham.

109
00:07:05,916 --> 00:07:10,661
Come into the drawing room and we can
make all the proper introductions.

110
00:07:19,638 --> 00:07:24,178
Do you think you'll enjoy village life?
It'll be very quiet after life in the city.

111
00:07:24,309 --> 00:07:26,016
Even Manchester.

112
00:07:26,645 --> 00:07:29,262
I'm sure I'll find something
to keep me busy.

113
00:07:29,356 --> 00:07:31,267
You might like the hospital.

114
00:07:31,358 --> 00:07:33,941
What sort of hospital
is it? How many beds?

115
00:07:34,027 --> 00:07:36,519
Well, it isn't really a hospital.

116
00:07:36,654 --> 00:07:38,941
Don't let Dr. Clarkson hear you.

117
00:07:39,031 --> 00:07:41,074
He thinks it's second only to St Thomas'.

118
00:07:41,158 --> 00:07:44,617
It's a college hospital, of course,
but quite well equipped.

119
00:07:44,703 --> 00:07:45,864
Who pays for it?

120
00:07:45,996 --> 00:07:48,533
Oh, good, let's talk about money.

121
00:07:48,874 --> 00:07:51,866
My father gave the building
and an endowment to run it.

122
00:07:51,961 --> 00:07:55,124
In a way, he set up his own memorial.

123
00:07:55,214 --> 00:07:56,465
MRS CRAWLEY: But how splendid.

124
00:07:56,549 --> 00:07:59,883
ROBERT: And Mr. Lloyd George's
new insurance measures will help.

125
00:07:59,969 --> 00:08:04,133
Please don't speak that man's name.
We are about to eat.

126
00:08:05,141 --> 00:08:07,726
I will hold it steady
and you can help yourself, sir.

127
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:10,723
Yes, I know. Thank you.

128
00:08:12,481 --> 00:08:15,081
You'll soon get used to the way
things are done here.

129
00:08:15,192 --> 00:08:20,561
If you mean that I'm accustomed to a very
different life from this, then that is true.

130
00:08:20,655 --> 00:08:22,566
What will you do with your time?

131
00:08:22,657 --> 00:08:26,491
I've got a job in Ripon,
and I've said I'll start tomorrow.

132
00:08:26,578 --> 00:08:27,659
A job?

133
00:08:27,745 --> 00:08:30,915
In a partnership. You might
have heard of it. Harvell and Carter.

134
00:08:30,999 --> 00:08:33,959
They need someone who understands
industrial law, I'm glad to say.

135
00:08:34,043 --> 00:08:37,411
Although I'm afraid most of it will be
wills and conveyancing.

136
00:08:37,505 --> 00:08:40,918
You do know I mean to involve you
in the running of the estate?

137
00:08:41,009 --> 00:08:44,172
Oh, don't worry.
There are plenty of hours in the day.

138
00:08:44,262 --> 00:08:46,503
And of course I'll have the weekend.

139
00:08:46,598 --> 00:08:50,011
We'll discuss this later,
we mustn't bore the ladies.

140
00:08:50,101 --> 00:08:52,183
What is a weekend?

141
00:08:56,274 --> 00:08:57,935
Why shouldn't he be a lawyer?

142
00:08:58,026 --> 00:09:00,688
Gentlemen don't work, silly.
Not real gentlemen.

143
00:09:00,778 --> 00:09:01,862
Don't listen to her, Daisy.

144
00:09:01,946 --> 00:09:05,688
No! Listen to me,
and take those kidneys up to the server

145
00:09:05,782 --> 00:09:08,618
before I knock you down
and serve your brains as fritters!

146
00:09:08,702 --> 00:09:10,534
DAISY: Yes, Mrs. Patmore.

147
00:09:10,621 --> 00:09:12,783
Wonder what that Mr. Molesley
makes of them.

148
00:09:12,873 --> 00:09:16,286
Poor old Molesley.
I pity the man who's taken that job.

149
00:09:16,376 --> 00:09:18,743
Then why did you apply for it?

150
00:09:19,796 --> 00:09:22,788
I felt it might help me
to get away from you, Mr. Bates.

151
00:09:24,635 --> 00:09:27,297
I'm so interested to see the hospital.

152
00:09:27,429 --> 00:09:31,388
Ooh. Well, you would be,
with your late husband a doctor.

153
00:09:31,475 --> 00:09:33,557
Not just my husband.

154
00:09:33,644 --> 00:09:36,688
My father and brother, too.
And I trained as a nurse during the war.

155
00:09:36,772 --> 00:09:38,137
Oh, fancy.

156
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:41,728
I'd love to be involved in some way.

157
00:09:41,818 --> 00:09:44,904
Well, you could always help with
the bring-and-buy sale next month.

158
00:09:44,988 --> 00:09:47,445
That would be most appreciated.

159
00:09:50,826 --> 00:09:53,662
She's a match for the old lady,
she wasn't going to give in.

160
00:09:53,746 --> 00:09:56,829
What old lady are you
referring to, Thomas?

161
00:09:56,958 --> 00:10:00,326
You cannot mean her ladyship,
the Dowager Countess.

162
00:10:00,461 --> 00:10:02,254
Not if you wish to remain in this house.

163
00:10:02,338 --> 00:10:03,999
No, Mr. Carson.

164
00:10:06,175 --> 00:10:07,586
William!

165
00:10:08,344 --> 00:10:11,757
Are you aware the seam at your shoulder
is coming apart?

166
00:10:11,847 --> 00:10:14,099
I felt it go a bit earlier on.
I'll mend it when we turn in.

167
00:10:14,183 --> 00:10:16,935
You will mend it now and you will
never again appear in public

168
00:10:17,019 --> 00:10:18,680
in a similar state of undress.

169
00:10:18,813 --> 00:10:19,848
No, Mr. Carson.

170
00:10:19,981 --> 00:10:24,100
To progress in your chosen career, William,
you must remember that a good servant,

171
00:10:24,193 --> 00:10:27,857
at all times,
retains a sense of pride and dignity

172
00:10:27,947 --> 00:10:32,440
that reflects the pride and dignity
of the family he serves.

173
00:10:32,993 --> 00:10:35,985
And never make me remind you of it again.

174
00:10:41,001 --> 00:10:42,412
I'll do it.

175
00:10:43,336 --> 00:10:46,704
And cheer up, we've all had a smack
from Mr. Carson.

176
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:50,458
You'll be the butler yourself one day,
then you'll do the smacking.

177
00:10:50,552 --> 00:10:52,008
I could never be like him.

178
00:10:52,095 --> 00:10:55,097
I bet he comes from a line of butlers
that goes back to the Conqueror.

179
00:10:55,181 --> 00:10:57,422
He learned his business and so will you.

180
00:10:57,559 --> 00:11:00,347
Even Mr. Carson wasn't born
standing to attention.

181
00:11:00,437 --> 00:11:02,929
I hope not for his mother's sake.

182
00:11:11,197 --> 00:11:12,858
This was at the back door.

183
00:11:12,949 --> 00:11:14,734
Thank you, William.

184
00:11:48,901 --> 00:11:51,233
It's kind of you to take an interest.

185
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:54,438
I'm afraid it's a case of
the warhorse and the drum.

186
00:11:55,115 --> 00:11:57,152
You know my late husband was a doctor.

187
00:11:57,284 --> 00:12:01,823
I do. I'm familiar with Dr. Crawley's work
on the symptoms of infection in children.

188
00:12:01,954 --> 00:12:06,494
Oh. Even I studied nursing
during the South African war.

189
00:12:06,626 --> 00:12:07,661
Really?

190
00:12:07,794 --> 00:12:09,410
[SOBBING]

191
00:12:12,256 --> 00:12:15,715
Very distressing. Young
farmer, John Drake.

192
00:12:15,802 --> 00:12:18,760
A tenant of Lord Grantham's.
He came in today.

193
00:12:18,846 --> 00:12:21,008
It's dropsy, I'm afraid.

194
00:12:21,516 --> 00:12:24,178
-May I see him?
-Yeah. By all means.

195
00:12:31,317 --> 00:12:35,982
-Is the dropsy of the liver or the heart?
-Everything points to the heart.

196
00:12:38,449 --> 00:12:41,031
[COUGHING]

197
00:12:41,785 --> 00:12:44,948
All right, Mr. Drake,
you're in safe hands now.

198
00:12:50,001 --> 00:12:52,459
What will happen to his wife?

199
00:12:52,546 --> 00:12:54,628
She may try to keep the farm on.

200
00:12:54,714 --> 00:12:58,878
Grantham is not a harsh landlord,
but her children are young.

201
00:13:00,637 --> 00:13:02,674
What can I do to help?

202
00:13:03,515 --> 00:13:07,053
If I'm to live in this village,
I must have an occupation.

203
00:13:07,185 --> 00:13:09,893
Please. Let me be useful.

204
00:13:11,398 --> 00:13:13,810
He chooses his clothes himself.

205
00:13:15,026 --> 00:13:18,735
He puts them out at night
and hangs the ones he's worn.

206
00:13:20,532 --> 00:13:23,326
I get to take the linen down to
the laundry. But that's about all.

207
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:24,490
That's all?

208
00:13:24,577 --> 00:13:28,866
"I'll do this", he says, "I'll
take the other". "I'll tie that".

209
00:13:29,373 --> 00:13:34,083
And I'm just stood there like a chump
watching a man get dressed.

210
00:13:36,046 --> 00:13:40,540
To be honest, Mr. Bates,
I don't see the point of it.

211
00:13:41,552 --> 00:13:43,839
ROBERT: I thought you didn't like him.

212
00:13:43,929 --> 00:13:47,467
Well, so what?
I have plenty of friends I don't like.

213
00:13:47,558 --> 00:13:50,676
Would you want Mary to marry one of them?

214
00:13:50,936 --> 00:13:55,055
Why do you always have to pretend to be
nicer than the rest of us?

215
00:13:55,191 --> 00:13:56,477
Perhaps I am.

216
00:13:56,567 --> 00:14:00,686
Then pity your wife, whose fortune must go
to this odd young man,

217
00:14:00,779 --> 00:14:03,817
who talks about "weekends" and "jobs".

218
00:14:03,908 --> 00:14:07,901
[SCOFFS] If Mary were to marry him
then all would be resolved.

219
00:14:15,251 --> 00:14:16,833
What've you got there?

220
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,251
Nothing.

221
00:14:18,922 --> 00:14:20,833
What kind of nothing?

222
00:14:20,924 --> 00:14:23,211
You haven't got an admirer?

223
00:14:23,885 --> 00:14:26,252
I might have. Why shouldn't I?

224
00:14:26,387 --> 00:14:30,176
Don't tell Mrs. Hughes or she'll bring
the vicar round to have you exorcised.

225
00:14:30,266 --> 00:14:34,476
How are we supposed to find husbands
if we're never allowed to see any men?

226
00:14:34,604 --> 00:14:37,596
Perhaps she thinks the stork brings them.

227
00:14:42,278 --> 00:14:45,521
Eh. Lady Mary's in for a surprise.

228
00:14:45,615 --> 00:14:49,233
Thomas was in the library
when old Violet came in from the garden.

229
00:14:49,327 --> 00:14:52,193
Seems they want to fix her up
with Mr. Crawley.

230
00:14:52,287 --> 00:14:56,076
Well, it makes sense.
She was going to marry Mr. Patrick.

231
00:14:56,166 --> 00:15:00,285
Would she have, though, when
it came to it? That's the question.

232
00:15:06,843 --> 00:15:10,461
Ah, there you are, dear.
I was hoping you'd be home in time.

233
00:15:10,597 --> 00:15:12,008
In time for what?

234
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:15,178
I've been paid the compliment of a visit.

235
00:15:21,316 --> 00:15:23,648
-Hello.
-Good afternoon, cousin Matthew.

236
00:15:23,777 --> 00:15:25,188
Afternoon.

237
00:15:26,488 --> 00:15:29,571
We were just saying how charming
this room is now.

238
00:15:29,658 --> 00:15:34,152
Mmm. It always seemed rather dark
when my mother-in-law lived here.

239
00:15:34,288 --> 00:15:37,700
But then she made everything rather dark.
[CHUCKLES]

240
00:15:37,832 --> 00:15:39,994
-Sir.
-No, thank you.

241
00:15:40,876 --> 00:15:44,494
-A cup of tea, sir?
-It's all right. I'll help myself.

242
00:15:48,676 --> 00:15:50,667
So, Molesley,

243
00:15:52,013 --> 00:15:56,098
how do you find being home again?
Your father must be glad you're back.

244
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:58,341
He is, your ladyship.

245
00:16:03,232 --> 00:16:05,394
Might I give you this cup?

246
00:16:06,861 --> 00:16:08,852
I'm afraid we must be going.

247
00:16:09,947 --> 00:16:12,609
-Thank you.
-You'll think about it?

248
00:16:17,371 --> 00:16:19,077
Ouch!

249
00:16:26,379 --> 00:16:28,962
Oh. I thought no one was here.

250
00:16:30,383 --> 00:16:32,420
Can I help, Mr. Carson?

251
00:16:32,552 --> 00:16:33,758
Uh...

252
00:16:34,554 --> 00:16:37,216
No. No, thank you, Anna.

253
00:16:43,772 --> 00:16:45,137
May I?

254
00:16:47,067 --> 00:16:49,399
I must compliment you, Mrs. Crawley.

255
00:16:49,486 --> 00:16:52,899
When you made your offer, I thought
you might be a "great lady nurse"

256
00:16:52,989 --> 00:16:55,447
and faint at the sight of blood.

257
00:16:55,909 --> 00:16:58,901
But I see you're made of sterner stuff.

258
00:17:01,498 --> 00:17:05,411
It's definitely the heart.
It's almost too quiet to hear at all.

259
00:17:05,501 --> 00:17:06,832
I'm afraid so.

260
00:17:06,919 --> 00:17:09,588
I've been thinking about
the treatments that are available.

261
00:17:09,672 --> 00:17:12,881
Considerable success have been achieved
over the last few years

262
00:17:12,966 --> 00:17:15,754
by draining the pericardial sac
of the excess fluid

263
00:17:15,844 --> 00:17:17,585
and administering adrenaline.

264
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:20,923
Mrs. Crawley, I appreciate
your thoroughness.

265
00:17:21,016 --> 00:17:22,723
But you're unwilling to try it?

266
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:25,893
Injection of adrenaline
is a comparatively new procedure.

267
00:17:25,979 --> 00:17:29,847
It's a while ago now,
but I saw my husband do it. I know how.

268
00:17:29,942 --> 00:17:34,061
Please, Mrs. Crawley,
don't force me to be uncivil.

269
00:17:34,154 --> 00:17:37,146
We would be setting
an impossible precedent

270
00:17:37,282 --> 00:17:41,025
when every villager could demand
the latest fad in treatment

271
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,031
for each new cut and graze.

272
00:17:43,122 --> 00:17:46,409
I would remind you that we're not talking
of a cut or a graze,

273
00:17:46,499 --> 00:17:48,917
but the loss of a man's life
and the ruin of his family.

274
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:53,666
Of course. But I beg you to see
that it is not reasonable.

275
00:17:56,968 --> 00:17:59,175
I'm sorry but I have standards.

276
00:17:59,303 --> 00:18:01,055
I've just seen something ever so odd.

277
00:18:01,139 --> 00:18:04,391
And if anyone thinks I'm going
to pull my forelock and curtsey to this

278
00:18:04,475 --> 00:18:06,216
Mr. Nobody from Nowhere...

279
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:07,675
O'Brien!

280
00:18:08,646 --> 00:18:10,978
Were you discussing Mr. Crawley?

281
00:18:11,899 --> 00:18:12,980
Yes, my lady.

282
00:18:13,067 --> 00:18:15,308
Is it your place to do so?

283
00:18:16,821 --> 00:18:20,564
I've got my opinions, my lady,
same as anybody.

284
00:18:20,658 --> 00:18:22,399
Can I help, your ladyship?

285
00:18:22,493 --> 00:18:24,578
This is the button we're missing
from my new evening coat.

286
00:18:24,662 --> 00:18:26,278
I found it lying on the gravel.

287
00:18:26,372 --> 00:18:31,741
But I was shocked at the talk I heard
as I came in.

288
00:18:32,377 --> 00:18:35,870
Mr. Crawley is his
lordship's cousin and heir.

289
00:18:36,006 --> 00:18:40,341
You will therefore, please, accord him
the respect he's entitled to.

290
00:18:41,511 --> 00:18:44,138
But you don't like him yourself, my lady.
You never wanted him to...

291
00:18:44,222 --> 00:18:47,681
You're sailing perilously close
to the wind, O'Brien.

292
00:18:47,768 --> 00:18:51,932
If we're to be friends, you will not speak
in that way again about the Crawleys

293
00:18:52,022 --> 00:18:55,105
or any member of Lord Grantham's family.

294
00:18:56,568 --> 00:19:00,232
Now I'm going up to rest.
Wake me at the dressing gong.

295
00:19:08,413 --> 00:19:11,371
I don't think that's fair,
not here in the servant's hall.

296
00:19:11,458 --> 00:19:12,743
I agree.

297
00:19:13,209 --> 00:19:15,877
If she was a real lady,
she wouldn't have come down here.

298
00:19:15,961 --> 00:19:18,130
She'd have rung for me
and given me the button, that's all.

299
00:19:18,214 --> 00:19:20,507
This isn't her territory.
We can say what we like down here.

300
00:19:20,591 --> 00:19:21,672
Who says?

301
00:19:21,759 --> 00:19:23,966
The law. And Parliament.

302
00:19:24,428 --> 00:19:26,221
There is such a thing as free speech.

303
00:19:26,305 --> 00:19:28,387
Not when I'm in charge.

304
00:19:29,809 --> 00:19:32,346
Don't push your luck, Thomas.

305
00:19:32,436 --> 00:19:36,270
Now, tea's over. Back to work.
You'd better take this.

306
00:19:39,485 --> 00:19:40,896
Friends.

307
00:19:41,403 --> 00:19:43,822
Who does she think she's fooling?
We're not friends.

308
00:19:43,906 --> 00:19:45,692
-No?
-No.

309
00:19:45,783 --> 00:19:48,115
And you're not friends
with the girls neither.

310
00:19:48,244 --> 00:19:49,780
We're servants, you and me.

311
00:19:49,912 --> 00:19:53,075
And they pay us to do as we're told,
that's all.

312
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:58,492
-May I...
-I can manage.

313
00:19:59,754 --> 00:20:01,711
Now where have I put my cuff links?

314
00:20:01,798 --> 00:20:03,215
I thought these would make a change.

315
00:20:03,299 --> 00:20:05,666
I want my usual ones.

316
00:20:07,762 --> 00:20:11,721
I know I'm a disappointment to you,
Molesley. But it's no good.

317
00:20:11,808 --> 00:20:14,891
I'll never get used to being dressed
like a doll.

318
00:20:14,978 --> 00:20:17,720
-Only trying to help, sir.
-Of course.

319
00:20:17,814 --> 00:20:19,607
And if I've offended you, I apologize.

320
00:20:19,691 --> 00:20:22,023
Surely you have better things to do.

321
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:24,067
This is my job, sir.

322
00:20:24,153 --> 00:20:28,442
Well. [CHUCKLES] It seems a very
silly occupation for a grown man.

323
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:35,779
Look, I'm sorry if I'm...

324
00:20:38,501 --> 00:20:39,990
I'm sorry.

325
00:20:47,342 --> 00:20:49,299
Why are you so against him?

326
00:20:49,386 --> 00:20:52,222
Aside from the fact he's planning
to steal our inheritance?

327
00:20:52,306 --> 00:20:54,047
Your inheritance.

328
00:20:54,474 --> 00:20:56,932
It makes no difference to Sybil and me.

329
00:20:57,019 --> 00:20:59,761
We won't inherit, whatever happens.

330
00:21:00,063 --> 00:21:01,770
He isn't one of us.

331
00:21:01,857 --> 00:21:05,441
Cousin Freddie's studying for the bar,
and so is Vivian MacDonald.

332
00:21:05,527 --> 00:21:09,771
MARY: At Lincoln's Inn. Not

The point is, my dear, I don't want you,

-You disliked the idea of him.
-That was before he came.

Now he's here, I don't see any
future in it. Not the way things are.

It's too ludicrous for words.

352
00:22:11,591 --> 00:22:14,674
It's not as simple as that.
The money isn't mine any more.

353

some of the newer treatments.

403
00:24:48,954 --> 00:24:53,619
Her father was King Cepheus
whose country was being ravaged by storms.

404

And in the end, he decided
the only way to appease the gods

405
00:24:57,295 --> 00:25:01,288
was to sacrifice his eldest daughter
to a hideous sea monster.

your pericardial sac is full of fluid.

and then to inject the adrenaline

and restore normal activity.

Is it dangerous, Doctor?

657
00:39:36,277 --> 00:39:38,735
The draining may stop the heart,

may not be able to restart it.
