1
00:00:37,369 --> 00:00:39,169
MRS HUGHES: Hurry up girls, come on.

2
00:00:45,169 --> 00:00:48,252
Come on, come on,
you should be done here!

3
00:00:48,339 --> 00:00:51,582
They'll be back from the station
any second now.

4
00:00:57,973 --> 00:01:00,635
I haven't had a chance to ask,
how was London?

5
00:01:00,726 --> 00:01:04,641
Oh, much as usual.
Dirty, noisy and quite enjoyable.

6
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:07,314
There was no need for you
to come back a day early.

7
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,108
I'm perfectly capable
of getting the house ready.

8
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:12,196
Of course you are,
but I like to have the heavy luggage

9
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,521
back and unpacked before they get here.

10
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:19,110
I suppose... Steady,
William. This isn't a race.

11
00:01:21,873 --> 00:01:23,159
Poor Iad.

12
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:24,911
But he did see her?

13
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:27,086
I was worried when I took him
to King's Cross.

14
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:29,252
Yes, he had time to say goodbye.

15
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:30,875
How is he now?

16
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:33,674
Well, you've only got one mother,
haven't you?

17
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,046
Mmm-hmm.

18
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:37,719
They're here, Mrs. Hughes.

19
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:52,068
Hello, William. It's
good to have you back.

20
00:01:53,322 --> 00:01:54,983
What a relief to be home!

21
00:01:55,074 --> 00:01:58,362
Don't listen when his lordship
pretends not to enjoy the season.

22
00:01:58,452 --> 00:01:59,988
When in Rome...

23
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:01,661
Will Lady Mary be back soon?

24
00:02:01,747 --> 00:02:04,291
She's staying on with my sister
for a couple of weeks.

25
00:02:04,375 --> 00:02:08,710
-So Grantham House is closed?
-It will be by the end of this week.

26
00:02:08,796 --> 00:02:10,662
Dear Mrs. Hughes,

27
00:02:10,756 --> 00:02:13,383
I hope you've had some time to yourself
while we've been away.

28
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:17,335
I've tackled a few jobs that get
forgotten about when the house is full.

29
00:02:18,264 --> 00:02:19,800
Any local news?

30
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:23,383
The main topic here is
the murder of the Austrian Archduke.

31
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:25,013
Here and everywhere else.

32
00:02:25,104 --> 00:02:27,641
I'm afraid we haven't
heard the last of that.

33
00:02:27,732 --> 00:02:30,144
-And how is William?
-Bearing up.

34
00:02:31,028 --> 00:02:33,520
Poor chap. He has our sympathies.

35
00:02:34,197 --> 00:02:36,199
I think I'll wash the
train off before dinner.

36
00:02:36,283 --> 00:02:38,326
Very good, milord.
I can unpack while you're bathing.

37
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:39,946
I'll see you up there.

38
00:02:40,037 --> 00:02:43,831
Oh, Mrs. Hughes, have you had any thoughts
about the garden party for the hospital?

39
00:02:43,915 --> 00:02:46,876
I've started on it, but there
are things we need to talk about.

40
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:51,045
Oh, dear. That sounds like trouble.
I'll take my hat off.

41
00:02:52,674 --> 00:02:57,635
Sybil, you were a great success
in London, darling. Well done.

42
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:01,926
You never say that to me.

43
00:03:02,017 --> 00:03:06,227
Don't I?
You were very helpful dear. Thank you.

44
00:03:08,273 --> 00:03:11,561
I hate to spoil her ladyship's homecoming,

45
00:03:11,652 --> 00:03:14,771
but what are we going to do
about Mrs. Patmore?

46
00:03:15,198 --> 00:03:17,986
She's worse than when
you left. Much worse.

47
00:03:19,911 --> 00:03:25,077
Oh, and I meant to ask, is there a
decision about Mr. Bates leaving?

48
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:29,956
Oh, not yet. His lordship wants the facts,
and Mr. Bates won't give them.

49
00:03:31,297 --> 00:03:34,881
So, what are you going to say
to her ladyship about Mrs. Patmore?

50
00:03:34,967 --> 00:03:37,459
MRS HUGHES: [SIGHS] I'm not sure.

51
00:03:37,553 --> 00:03:43,174
I don't want the poor woman sacked,
but things cannot go on as they are.

52
00:03:48,272 --> 00:03:50,899
ROSAMUND: There's nothing
like an English summer is there?

53
00:03:50,983 --> 00:03:53,350
MARY: Except an English winter.

54
00:03:54,529 --> 00:03:57,613
I'm sorry you haven't received
more invitations.

55
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:02,160
But then, after four seasons,
one is less a debutante than a survivor.

56
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:06,118
My dear, is there anything
you're not telling me?

57
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,077
-No.
-Only one hears stories...

58
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:12,537
There's nothing, Aunt Rosamund.

59
00:04:13,841 --> 00:04:19,883
So, have you decided
whether or not to marry Cousin Matthew?

60
00:04:20,347 --> 00:04:24,136
Oh, there's no secret Cora can keep
for more than a month.

61
00:04:24,226 --> 00:04:26,012
You'd be surprised!

62
00:04:26,729 --> 00:04:30,142
I've told him I'll give him my answer
the day I get back.

63
00:04:30,274 --> 00:04:35,110
Well, it would be very tidy,
at least we can say that.

64
00:04:45,331 --> 00:04:48,494
-Fancy a smoke?
-Don't mind if I do.

65
00:04:49,586 --> 00:04:52,123
There they go. Guy
Fawkes and his assistant.

66
00:04:52,589 --> 00:04:54,626
-Which is which?
-Here you are.

67
00:04:59,679 --> 00:05:02,512
Surely, if his lordship
hasn't done anything until now,

68
00:05:02,599 --> 00:05:04,949
it means he doesn't want
to take it any further.

69
00:05:06,186 --> 00:05:09,269
WILLIAM: Anna's made me an armband,
Mr. Carson.

70
00:05:09,355 --> 00:05:11,642
For my mother. Can I wear it?

71
00:05:12,025 --> 00:05:15,859
I dare say, not when we're entertaining,
but otherwise.

72
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:32,787
-Hello, Doctor. I didn't know you were here.
-No, Lady Grantham sent a message.

73
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,464
-Why? She's not ill, is she?
-Not ill, exactly.

74
00:05:38,177 --> 00:05:40,885
Would you mind waiting in the library?

75
00:05:44,892 --> 00:05:45,973
Pregnant?

76
00:05:47,061 --> 00:05:49,553
You needn't be quite so shocked.

77
00:05:49,897 --> 00:05:51,558
Give me a moment.

78
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:57,235
-You haven't been pregnant for 18 years.
-And I'm pregnant now.

79
00:05:57,321 --> 00:05:59,489
I don't understand
what we've done differently.

80
00:05:59,573 --> 00:06:03,285
Stop right there. If you want to know more,
go down and offer the doctor some whiskey.

81
00:06:03,369 --> 00:06:05,155
I can't take it in.

82
00:06:05,747 --> 00:06:07,579
But you're pleased?

83
00:06:10,836 --> 00:06:12,247
Of course.

84
00:06:13,922 --> 00:06:15,022
Of course I'm pleased.

85
00:06:18,093 --> 00:06:19,583
[CHUCKLING]

86
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:27,182
I didn't think she'd do it.

87
00:06:27,269 --> 00:06:29,101
I told you she would.

88
00:06:29,604 --> 00:06:31,436
I could see she was interested.

89
00:06:31,565 --> 00:06:33,775
And I was speaking
as one lady's maid to another.

90
00:06:33,859 --> 00:06:35,359
That means something, you know.

91
00:06:35,443 --> 00:06:39,562
Course we thought we had him before,
but he's a slippery devil.

92
00:06:46,371 --> 00:06:51,287
-CLARKSON: It's unusual, obviously.
-Unusual? It's Biblical.

93
00:06:51,627 --> 00:06:53,538
[CHUCKLES] Not quite.

94
00:06:54,755 --> 00:06:58,373
You understand that women
go through a certain change.

95
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:02,210
Thank you. I know quite as much
as I need to about all that.

96
00:07:02,555 --> 00:07:04,796
Well, sometimes it can result

97
00:07:05,725 --> 00:07:09,889
in a surge of fertility,
for want of a better word.

98
00:07:09,979 --> 00:07:13,079
-But the child will be healthy?
-Oh, there's no reason why not.

99
00:07:13,858 --> 00:07:15,314
How long has she...

100
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:19,649
Hard to be precise.
Things had become irregular, but...

101
00:07:20,114 --> 00:07:21,320
Please!

102
00:07:21,449 --> 00:07:25,488
I'd say she's about four months gone.
It'll begin to show soon.

103
00:07:26,537 --> 00:07:29,620
And I don't suppose
there's any way of knowing if it's a...

104
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:36,503
I do beg your pardon, milord.
I thought you were alone.

105
00:07:36,715 --> 00:07:39,958
No, please come in, Mrs. Hughes.
I'm just leaving.

106
00:07:40,052 --> 00:07:41,087
MRS HUGHES: William!

107
00:07:41,178 --> 00:07:44,296
Well, thank you, Doctor.
I'd better start writing some letters.

108
00:07:44,973 --> 00:07:47,010
Show Dr. Clarkson out.

109
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:56,401
I didn't want to bother her ladyship,
if she's not well...

110
00:07:56,485 --> 00:07:58,192
She's resting, but tell me anyway.

111
00:07:59,571 --> 00:08:01,687
It's Mrs. Patmore, milord.

112
00:08:02,366 --> 00:08:05,324
The time has come
when we really have to make a decision.

113
00:08:07,663 --> 00:08:08,698
Hmm.

114
00:08:15,546 --> 00:08:17,253
THOMAS: Now do you believe me?

115
00:08:17,382 --> 00:08:20,841
Careful, Thomas.
Your position is not a strong one.

116
00:08:20,927 --> 00:08:24,795
Don't punish us, Mr. Carson.
It's Mr Bates who's wanting here.

117
00:08:24,889 --> 00:08:26,682
Tell me, Mr. Carson, do you think it right

118
00:08:26,766 --> 00:08:29,224
a man like that should live and work
at Downton?

119
00:08:48,246 --> 00:08:49,532
[DOOR OPENING]

120
00:08:50,415 --> 00:08:51,951
Mr. Napier, milady.

121
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:56,584
What a surprise!
I'm afraid you've just missed my aunt.

122
00:08:57,255 --> 00:09:00,794
[CHUCKLES] I know. I watched her leave.

123
00:09:02,094 --> 00:09:04,882
How are your wedding plans going?

124
00:09:04,972 --> 00:09:08,761
Not very well.
In fact, we've decided to call it off.

125
00:09:09,476 --> 00:09:10,557
Really?

126
00:09:11,145 --> 00:09:13,603
Well, it seemed quite
fixed at Sybil's ball.

127
00:09:14,815 --> 00:09:16,305
What a shame!

128
00:09:16,775 --> 00:09:17,810
Please.

129
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,146
It'll be better in the long run.

130
00:09:23,282 --> 00:09:24,272
Perhaps.

131
00:09:24,825 --> 00:09:27,325
I know what high hopes
you have of the institution.

132
00:09:30,122 --> 00:09:31,954
The thing is, Lady Mary,

133
00:09:32,082 --> 00:09:34,042
I am here today because
I needed to tell you something,

134
00:09:34,126 --> 00:09:36,959
face to face, before
you went to the country.

135
00:09:37,087 --> 00:09:40,455
"Face to face"? Gracious me!

136
00:09:40,591 --> 00:09:45,132
I've recently heard gossip about the time
when I came to Downton with Kemal Pamuk.

137
00:09:46,264 --> 00:09:49,848
Gossip that I believe
has made life difficult for you.

138
00:09:51,811 --> 00:09:54,861
I've also heard it said
that I am the source of these stories.

139
00:09:57,692 --> 00:10:00,742
It is very important to me
that you should know that I am not.

140
00:10:02,322 --> 00:10:06,281
From that day to this, I have never
spoken one word on the matter.

141
00:10:06,367 --> 00:10:07,857
Then who did?

142
00:10:08,912 --> 00:10:11,995
It seems to have come
from the Turkish Embassy,

143
00:10:12,082 --> 00:10:15,575
from the Ambassador himself, in fact,
and his wife.

144
00:10:16,336 --> 00:10:19,078
But who told them, if not you?

145
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:22,001
This is the hard part.

146
00:10:23,343 --> 00:10:26,013
When I discovered the answer,
I debated whether I should relay it,

147
00:10:26,097 --> 00:10:28,097
but in the end I feel you ought to know.

148
00:10:28,557 --> 00:10:30,719
The suspense is killing me.

149
00:10:33,729 --> 00:10:37,188
It was your sister, Lady Edith,
who wrote to the Ambassador.

150
00:10:37,274 --> 00:10:39,891
That is why people accept the story.

151
00:10:41,904 --> 00:10:43,019
Edith?

152
00:10:43,864 --> 00:10:45,901
It is very hard to believe.

153
00:10:48,285 --> 00:10:50,276
Harder for you than for me.

154
00:10:56,877 --> 00:11:00,415
I love the thought of a baby in the house,
but if it's a boy...

155
00:11:00,548 --> 00:11:02,789
It'll be very hard on Mr. Crawley.

156
00:11:02,883 --> 00:11:04,499
I know.

157
00:11:04,593 --> 00:11:07,677
I was no great champion
when he first arrived,

158
00:11:07,764 --> 00:11:11,723
but it seems to me he's tried his best,
and he's done the decent thing.

159
00:11:12,602 --> 00:11:14,468
I can't see that coming off.

160
00:11:15,397 --> 00:11:20,517
-You don't mean the engagement?
-But it's not an engagement yet, is it?

161
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:22,396
She'd never throw him over!

162
00:11:24,406 --> 00:11:28,240
Mr. Carson, Lady Mary Crawley
does not deserve you.

163
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:41,172
COUNTESS: And she's not
been in touch with Cousin Matthew?

164
00:11:41,256 --> 00:11:43,088
CORA: Not that I've heard.

165
00:11:44,009 --> 00:11:46,125
Wonderful news, of course.

166
00:11:46,761 --> 00:11:48,251
You must look after yourself.

167
00:11:48,597 --> 00:11:51,465
Don't worry. O'Brien has me
wrapped in silk and feathers.

168
00:11:52,351 --> 00:11:54,058
You're lucky.

169
00:11:54,145 --> 00:11:58,480
I have a horrible feeling
Simmons is about to hand in her notice.

170
00:11:59,025 --> 00:12:05,112
She's looking very fidgety, lately, and I
saw her hurrying to meet the postman.

171
00:12:05,489 --> 00:12:07,605
Oh, you poor thing.

172
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:10,863
Is there anything worse
than losing one's maid?

173
00:12:11,454 --> 00:12:14,663
I mean, why would she want to leave me?

174
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:16,701
I've been as gentle as a lamb.

175
00:12:19,545 --> 00:12:21,286
Most of the time.

176
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,763
ROBERT: I want to say
I'll make provision for you,

177
00:12:29,847 --> 00:12:32,179
if it's a boy and you get pushed out.

178
00:12:32,308 --> 00:12:34,641
Don't worry, I know you can't.

179
00:12:35,729 --> 00:12:39,893
If any man living understands
the strength of the entail, it's me.

180
00:12:39,983 --> 00:12:43,567
I can give you Crawley House for life,
if it's a help.

181
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,896
Have you heard from Mary?

182
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:48,697
No. Have you?

183
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:53,744
By the way, I want to ask a favor.
What's the name of your cook?

184
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:56,322
The one you brought with you
from Manchester?

185
00:12:56,416 --> 00:12:57,747
Mrs. Bird.

186
00:13:01,171 --> 00:13:04,334
-I'll get it, Mrs. Patmore!
-Oh! Don't fuss me!

187
00:13:04,424 --> 00:13:06,474
WILLIAM: is that everything? DAISY: Yeah.

188
00:13:06,843 --> 00:13:09,005
How are you feeling?

189
00:13:09,096 --> 00:13:11,848
Well, most people's parents die
before them, and so they should...

190
00:13:11,932 --> 00:13:13,047
Oh, give it a rest.

191
00:13:13,141 --> 00:13:15,936
Your mother knew how to drag it out,
I'll say that for her.

192
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:17,761
-What?
-MRS HUGHES: Thomas!

193
00:13:17,855 --> 00:13:19,391
Get up to the servery!

194
00:13:19,482 --> 00:13:23,396
[SHRIEKS] You gave me the wrong cloth! Ow!

195
00:13:23,486 --> 00:13:24,897
Here, sit down, Mrs. Patmore.

196
00:13:24,988 --> 00:13:27,571
I can't sit down,
I've got the luncheon to finish!

197
00:13:27,657 --> 00:13:29,944
It was not a suggestion. Sit!

198
00:13:31,035 --> 00:13:33,743
Daisy and I will finish the luncheon.

199
00:13:43,006 --> 00:13:46,124
So he'll give us this house
for life, will he? How generous!

200
00:13:46,217 --> 00:13:48,800
It is generous. He doesn't have to.

201
00:13:51,264 --> 00:13:53,255
But it's made me think.

202
00:13:54,392 --> 00:13:56,679
You must stay here if you want,

203
00:13:56,769 --> 00:14:01,685
but I wonder if it mightn't be better
all round if I went back to Manchester.

204
00:14:02,443 --> 00:14:03,933
It may not be a boy.

205
00:14:05,195 --> 00:14:08,031
Really, Mother. You never
approved of it all in the first place.

206
00:14:08,115 --> 00:14:12,325
If it is a boy, you should see it as
a release, not a disappointment.

207
00:14:13,871 --> 00:14:15,953
What does Mary say?

208
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:19,581
Nothing yet.

209
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:24,704
You wanted to see Mrs. Bird, sir.

210
00:14:24,798 --> 00:14:30,419
Yes, Mrs. Bird, Lord Grantham
has rather a favour to ask of you.

211
00:14:32,181 --> 00:14:36,015
I'm surprised Lord Grantham
knows that I exist, sir.

212
00:14:36,769 --> 00:14:37,804
[LAUGHS]

213
00:14:43,026 --> 00:14:44,767
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]

214
00:14:47,447 --> 00:14:48,937
I'm sorry to disturb you.

215
00:14:50,033 --> 00:14:51,740
Quite all right.

216
00:14:51,826 --> 00:14:56,536
Mr. Bates, it's about
your somewhat startling confession.

217
00:14:57,374 --> 00:15:00,724
As you'll have surmised, his
lordship has yet to come to a decision.

218
00:15:01,336 --> 00:15:02,701
His delay is generous.

219
00:15:03,254 --> 00:15:06,497
However, it will be no surprise to you

220
00:15:06,591 --> 00:15:11,301
that Miss O'Brien has been
unwilling to let things drop.

221
00:15:12,514 --> 00:15:16,599
It seems that, when we were in London,
she made a new friend.

222
00:15:16,684 --> 00:15:21,019
A lady's maid in the house of a colonel
in your former regiment.

223
00:15:29,698 --> 00:15:34,238
Please tell me that this account is false,
at least in part.

224
00:15:36,038 --> 00:15:37,620
I wish I could.

225
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:43,417
-I'll have to show this to his lordship.
-Of course you will.

226
00:15:43,629 --> 00:15:48,214
I do not like to play the part of
Pontius Pilate, but I'm afraid I must.

227
00:15:49,218 --> 00:15:51,676
Lord Grantham will
decide what's to be done.

228
00:15:56,559 --> 00:15:57,924
Mr. Bates,

229
00:15:59,437 --> 00:16:02,187
I hope you do not feel
that I have treated you unjustly.

230
00:16:03,149 --> 00:16:07,063
On the contrary, Mr. Carson,
I am astonished at your kindness.

231
00:16:20,709 --> 00:16:25,624
Of all of you, Sybil might
find joy in a cottage, but not you.

232
00:16:25,714 --> 00:16:27,048
We don't know it'll be a boy.

233
00:16:27,132 --> 00:16:30,625
Exactly, so ask Matthew
to wait until the child is born.

234
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:34,222
If it's a girl you can wed him happily,
and all will be as it was before.

235
00:16:34,306 --> 00:16:37,719
But if I delay, won't he think
I'm only after him for his position?

236
00:16:38,894 --> 00:16:43,434
Besides, I'm not sure I want to
put him off, even without the title.

237
00:16:44,691 --> 00:16:46,728
We get on so well, you know.

238
00:16:46,818 --> 00:16:50,402
And he's terribly clever.
He might end up Lord Chancellor.

239
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:54,949
And he might not.
Oh, come along, Mary, be sensible.

240
00:16:55,036 --> 00:16:57,536
Can you really see yourself
dawdling your life away

241
00:16:57,622 --> 00:17:00,614
as the wife of a country solicitor?

242
00:17:07,924 --> 00:17:11,167
But why would we ever want
a telephone at Downton, milord?

243
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:13,297
ROBERT: Well, they have their uses.

244
00:17:13,387 --> 00:17:15,431
You could speak
to the housekeeper in London.

245
00:17:15,515 --> 00:17:16,846
That'd be helpful surely?

246
00:17:16,933 --> 00:17:20,426
I hope I've not failed
in my management of the recent move?

247
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:24,138
Not at all. But the telephone is here now,

248
00:17:24,232 --> 00:17:26,894
and the girls got used to it
when we were in London.

249
00:17:26,984 --> 00:17:30,477
Besides, none of us know
what the next few months will bring.

250
00:17:30,571 --> 00:17:32,528
Because of the Archduke's death?

251
00:17:32,615 --> 00:17:37,156
Austria won't get what it wants from
Serbia. And now Russia's starting to rumble.

252
00:17:37,246 --> 00:17:40,113
Well, there's not much
we can do about that.

253
00:17:40,207 --> 00:17:46,624
-So, will you take care of the telephone man?
-Hmm. Oh, about Mr. Bates, milord,

254
00:17:47,047 --> 00:17:50,881
I expect you've had time
to consider the contents of that letter?

255
00:17:50,968 --> 00:17:53,630
Yes. But I find it very odd.

256
00:17:54,179 --> 00:17:55,920
Regimental silver?

257
00:17:56,014 --> 00:17:59,225
I could more easily see Bates
as an assassin than a petty pilferer.

258
00:17:59,309 --> 00:18:03,473
I agree, and while the letter
is hard to argue with,

259
00:18:03,564 --> 00:18:07,228
I wouldn't put anything past Thomas
or Miss O'Brien.

260
00:18:12,406 --> 00:18:15,819
-So, what did we miss?
-Nothing much.

261
00:18:15,951 --> 00:18:18,370
Although you'd have had
more invitations than I did.

262
00:18:18,454 --> 00:18:22,823
-Have you thought about Matthew?
-Of course, but Aunt Rosamund...

263
00:18:22,917 --> 00:18:25,579
She's written to me.
I should pay no attention.

264
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:28,913
But, Granny, she has got a point.
Mary can't be completely naïve.

265
00:18:29,007 --> 00:18:30,748
I don't need your help, thank you.

266
00:18:30,842 --> 00:18:34,255
Mary, listen to me, if
you take Matthew now,

267
00:18:34,345 --> 00:18:39,431
when his whole future is at risk,
he will love you to the end of his days.

268
00:18:39,517 --> 00:18:41,508
Why, Granny, you're a romantic!

269
00:18:42,478 --> 00:18:44,605
I've been called many
things, but never that.

270
00:18:44,689 --> 00:18:47,733
And what happens if the baby is a boy
and Matthew loses everything?

271
00:18:47,817 --> 00:18:49,524
Mary can always change her mind.

272
00:18:49,611 --> 00:18:52,112
But I can't do that to Matthew.
It's not how we are together.

273
00:18:52,196 --> 00:18:55,689
-COUNTESS: Oh!
-I'm going upstairs to help Anna unpack.

274
00:18:55,825 --> 00:18:57,611
I'll come with you.

275
00:19:02,207 --> 00:19:04,494
Edith, why don't you go, too?

276
00:19:08,547 --> 00:19:11,630
Sir Anthony Strallan
was at Lady Wren's party.

277
00:19:12,384 --> 00:19:13,715
He asked after you.

278
00:19:22,561 --> 00:19:25,474
Is she really serious about him?

279
00:19:25,564 --> 00:19:27,680
Any port in a storm.

280
00:19:28,359 --> 00:19:34,230
By the way, I was right about my maid.
She's leaving, to get married.

281
00:19:34,907 --> 00:19:38,400
-How can she be so selfish?
-I do sympathize.

282
00:19:39,078 --> 00:19:42,742
Robert's always wanting me to
get rid of O'Brien, but I can't face it.

283
00:19:42,831 --> 00:19:47,076
-Anyway, she's so fond of me.
-Well, I thought Simmons was fond of me.

284
00:19:47,879 --> 00:19:49,540
What am I to do?

285
00:19:49,923 --> 00:19:51,799
Why don't I put an advertisement
in <i>The Lady?</i>

286
00:19:51,883 --> 00:19:53,683
It's always the best place to start.

287
00:19:54,177 --> 00:19:59,843
Oh, that's so kind, thank you.
Now, I really must be going.

288
00:19:59,933 --> 00:20:05,849
Now, don't let Mary wait for the baby
before she gives Matthew her answer.

289
00:20:05,939 --> 00:20:08,101
I'm sure it's another girl.

290
00:20:09,067 --> 00:20:11,775
I know those men of the moral high ground.

291
00:20:12,612 --> 00:20:16,230
If she won't say, "yes",
when he might be poor,

292
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:19,613
he won't want her, when he will be rich.

293
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,623
Maybe we should knit something.

294
00:20:23,707 --> 00:20:26,807
Oh, yes, I'm sure they'd love
a pair of bootees knitted by you.

295
00:20:26,919 --> 00:20:30,457
-Or what about a christening mug?
-They can buy their own silver.

296
00:20:30,589 --> 00:20:31,965
Anything in the paper, Thomas?

297
00:20:32,049 --> 00:20:34,882
They've arrested this Princip fellow
and his gang.

298
00:20:34,969 --> 00:20:37,381
All Serbian and members of the Black Hand.

299
00:20:37,471 --> 00:20:40,071
"The Black Hand"?
Oh, I don't like the sound of that.

300
00:20:40,266 --> 00:20:42,974
I don't like the sound of any of it.
War is on the way.

301
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:44,471
Then we'll have to face it,

302
00:20:44,603 --> 00:20:47,311
-as bravely as we can.
-Thank you, Mr. Cannon Fodder.

303
00:20:47,815 --> 00:20:49,232
Don't you think a war's coming?

304
00:20:49,316 --> 00:20:52,566
Oh, there'll be a war, all right.
And it's time to prepare for it.

305
00:20:53,112 --> 00:20:55,604
-The country, do you mean?
-No, me.

306
00:20:56,365 --> 00:20:57,855
You never disappoint.

307
00:20:59,034 --> 00:21:04,245
Daisy, run and find Mrs. Patmore. His
lordship wants to see her in the library.

308
00:21:04,331 --> 00:21:07,031
His lordship wants Mrs. Patmore
to go up to the library?

309
00:21:07,501 --> 00:21:11,336
That is what I said.
And Anna, you're to come, too.

310
00:21:15,343 --> 00:21:19,382
And we thought the assassination
of an Archduke was a surprise.

311
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:25,892
Mrs. Patmore, milord.

312
00:21:32,527 --> 00:21:36,691
Your lordship, I know things
haven't been quite right for a while,

313
00:21:36,823 --> 00:21:39,123
-but I can assure you...
-Come in, Mrs. Patmore.

314
00:21:41,703 --> 00:21:45,241
I promise you, milord, if I could
just be allowed a bit more time...

315
00:21:45,373 --> 00:21:48,473
Mrs. Patmore, I have not asked you here
to give you your notice.

316
00:21:49,586 --> 00:21:51,202
-Haven't you?
-No.

317
00:21:51,338 --> 00:21:53,507
I understand you've had
some trouble with your sight...

318
00:21:53,591 --> 00:21:56,009
That's just it!
I know I could manage better if only...

319
00:21:56,093 --> 00:21:59,336
-Please, Mrs. Patmore!
-Let him speak!

320
00:22:00,181 --> 00:22:02,092
-Beg pardon, milord.
-Don't apologize.

321
00:22:02,225 --> 00:22:05,269
Now, on Dr. Clarkson's recommendation,
I'm sending you up to London

322
00:22:05,353 --> 00:22:07,435
to see an eye specialist at Moorfields.

323
00:22:08,356 --> 00:22:10,858
Anna will go with you
and you'll stay with my sister Rosamund,

324
00:22:10,942 --> 00:22:13,559
in her new house in Belgrave Square.

325
00:22:14,445 --> 00:22:17,483
I'm afraid I'm going to have to sit
in your presence, milord.

326
00:22:17,573 --> 00:22:18,938
Of course.

327
00:22:22,119 --> 00:22:24,406
[STAMMERING]
But how will you get on here?

328
00:22:26,249 --> 00:22:30,914
Well, Mrs Crawley is lending us
her cook, Mrs. Bird.

329
00:22:31,295 --> 00:22:32,337
She's coming over tomorrow.

330
00:22:32,421 --> 00:22:35,084
You'll be good enough
to show her how things work.

331
00:22:35,217 --> 00:22:37,317
Are the Crawleys to starve while I'm away?

332
00:22:38,303 --> 00:22:40,044
They'll eat here every evening.

333
00:22:40,138 --> 00:22:44,223
Now, my sister's butler will
look after you. He's very nice.

334
00:22:44,309 --> 00:22:46,346
Anna, you won't mind a visit to London?

335
00:22:46,436 --> 00:22:50,145
No, milord. Thank you.
It'll be an adventure.

336
00:22:50,941 --> 00:22:53,308
One with a happy ending, I hope.

337
00:22:57,114 --> 00:22:58,445
Cor.

338
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:06,206
Let me get this clear, at Sybil's ball
you said you'd give me your answer

339
00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:08,041
the day you got back,
and now you say you will not!

340
00:23:08,125 --> 00:23:11,834
Why do we have to rush into it?
I need to be sure, that's all.

341
00:23:12,129 --> 00:23:13,836
But you were sure.

342
00:23:14,339 --> 00:23:15,715
Shall I tell you what I
think has altered you?

343
00:23:15,799 --> 00:23:17,550
My prospects!
Because nothing else has changed!

344
00:23:17,634 --> 00:23:18,796
-No.
-Yes!

345
00:23:18,928 --> 00:23:21,096
If your mother's child is a boy,
then he's the heir

346
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:23,766
and I go back to living on my wits,
and you'd rather not follow me there!

347
00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:27,309
Oh, Matthew, you always
make everything so black and white.

348
00:23:27,854 --> 00:23:29,936
I think this is black and white.

349
00:23:30,023 --> 00:23:32,423
Do you love me enough
to spend your life with me?

350
00:23:33,026 --> 00:23:35,142
If you don't, then say no.

351
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:38,402
-If you do, then say yes.
-I want to...

352
00:23:39,824 --> 00:23:44,489
Granny told me I should say yes now,
then withdraw if you lost everything.

353
00:23:47,749 --> 00:23:50,582
To make that work,
you'd have to be a good liar.

354
00:23:51,502 --> 00:23:53,368
Are you a good liar?

355
00:23:54,088 --> 00:23:56,671
Well, not good enough
to try it, apparently.

356
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:05,595
How could you not have realized
they'd discover the loss at once?

357
00:24:05,684 --> 00:24:08,051
And to keep them in your house...

358
00:24:09,563 --> 00:24:12,806
-But you only served two years?
-That's right, milord.

359
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:17,019
So, clearly the judge thought
there was some mitigating factor.

360
00:24:18,197 --> 00:24:20,564
I just want to know the truth.

361
00:24:21,533 --> 00:24:23,991
I cannot speak of it, milord.

362
00:24:24,078 --> 00:24:29,039
You must decide whether I stay or go
on the basis of the evidence before you.

363
00:24:29,124 --> 00:24:30,956
I will respect that.

364
00:24:36,715 --> 00:24:39,423
I'm sorry. I don't believe it.

365
00:24:40,219 --> 00:24:43,257
How can you say that,
when I've confessed to the crime?

366
00:24:44,891 --> 00:24:48,185
Well, his lordship obviously
doesn't think that's all there is to it,

367
00:24:48,269 --> 00:24:49,851
and I don't either.

368
00:24:49,938 --> 00:24:53,226
Anna, are you set for
the 9 o'clock train tomorrow?

369
00:24:53,441 --> 00:24:54,727
All packed and ready.

370
00:24:54,818 --> 00:24:57,901
You'll be met at King's Cross
by Lady Rosamund's chauffeur,

371
00:24:57,988 --> 00:25:01,982
which I think is generous,
but after that you're on your own.

372
00:25:02,075 --> 00:25:03,486
Right, I must get on.

373
00:25:03,576 --> 00:25:06,489
I'm acting referee
for Mrs Patmore and Mrs. Bird.

374
00:25:06,913 --> 00:25:08,745
-Best of luck.
-Mmm.

375
00:25:14,587 --> 00:25:16,419
Will you miss me?

376
00:25:18,425 --> 00:25:21,759
Try not to miss me.
It'll be good practice.

377
00:25:27,435 --> 00:25:31,144
I expect it'll be hard
adjusting to this kitchen,

378
00:25:31,272 --> 00:25:34,390
-after the one you're used to.
-Not to worry.

379
00:25:34,483 --> 00:25:37,646
I'm sure I can have it
cleaned up in no time.

380
00:25:37,778 --> 00:25:38,768
Cleaned up?

381
00:25:39,196 --> 00:25:41,062
I'm not criticizing.

382
00:25:41,157 --> 00:25:44,695
With your eyesight, it's a wonder
you could see the pots at all.

383
00:25:45,619 --> 00:25:48,407
You have met Daisy and the others?

384
00:25:48,497 --> 00:25:51,956
I have. Though what they all
find to do is a mystery to me.

385
00:25:52,334 --> 00:25:55,184
MRS PATMORE: Are you not
used to managing staff, Mrs. Bird?

386
00:25:55,296 --> 00:25:59,210
I'm used to getting it done
with one kitchen maid, Mrs. Patmore,

387
00:26:00,342 --> 00:26:05,178
but I suppose in a house like this
you expect to take it easy.

388
00:26:07,725 --> 00:26:10,269
Do you think we should erect a ring
and let them fight it out?

389
00:26:10,353 --> 00:26:13,061
[CHUCKLES] She's all right, Mrs. Bird.

390
00:26:13,774 --> 00:26:18,359
She's more of a general than a trooper,
but, you know, you need that in a cook.

391
00:26:18,445 --> 00:26:20,311
Mrs. Patmore's the generalissimo.

392
00:26:20,405 --> 00:26:21,691
[LAUGHS]

393
00:26:28,872 --> 00:26:30,658
Well, I'm very sad.

394
00:26:32,709 --> 00:26:36,998
-I thought Mary was made of better stuff.
-Don't speak against her.

395
00:26:38,173 --> 00:26:41,217
Of course, she's taken advice from someone
with false and greedy values.

396
00:26:41,301 --> 00:26:43,219
-Oh, Mother.
-And we don't have to go too far

397
00:26:43,303 --> 00:26:45,138
to know who that is! I've a good mind...

398
00:26:45,222 --> 00:26:49,307
Mother! You are not to go near
Cousin Violet, that is an order.

399
00:26:50,185 --> 00:26:53,018
-Something's not right about it.
-I agree.

400
00:26:53,731 --> 00:26:56,567
Having a silver thief in the house
does not seem right at all,

401
00:26:56,651 --> 00:26:57,982
even if he could walk.

402
00:26:59,529 --> 00:27:01,739
But Carson isn't keen
to get rid of him either,

403
00:27:01,823 --> 00:27:04,408
and he normally comes down on
this sort of thing like a ton of bricks.

404
00:27:04,492 --> 00:27:05,732
What's his reasoning?

405
00:27:06,702 --> 00:27:09,239
He blames Thomas and O'Brien.

406
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:11,957
He says they've been working
against Bates since he got here.

407
00:27:12,041 --> 00:27:14,408
So I should sack O'Brien instead?

408
00:27:14,502 --> 00:27:16,334
You'll hear no argument from me.

409
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:19,162
This should do the trick, milady.

410
00:27:23,803 --> 00:27:25,763
Ten years of my life,
that's what I've given her.

411
00:27:25,847 --> 00:27:27,178
Ten bloody years!

412
00:27:27,265 --> 00:27:30,599
-But did she say she'd sack you?
-It's obviously what he wants.

413
00:27:30,685 --> 00:27:34,178
-So when will they tell you?
-When they've found a replacement.

414
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:37,811
Heaven forfend she should have to put
a comb through her own hair!

415
00:27:37,901 --> 00:27:40,233
And if I'm going, you won't be far behind.

416
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,652
Oh, so what? Sod 'em.

417
00:27:42,739 --> 00:27:45,197
There's a war coming and war means change.

418
00:27:45,284 --> 00:27:46,991
We should be making plans.

419
00:27:47,077 --> 00:27:49,739
-What are you talking about?
-Well, put it like this.

420
00:27:50,205 --> 00:27:51,498
I don't want to be a footman any more,

421
00:27:51,582 --> 00:27:54,495
but I don't intend to be
killed in battle, neither.

422
00:28:02,509 --> 00:28:04,841
[WHISPERING] I'm not saying poison them.

423
00:28:05,262 --> 00:28:08,550
Just make sure they don't find her food
all that agreeable.

424
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:12,053
-[WHISPERING] By poisoning it?
-Will you stop that!

425
00:28:12,144 --> 00:28:14,636
You don't want it to taste nice.

426
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:18,143
I want them to be glad when I get back,
that's all.

[MRS PATMORE SIGHS]

428
00:28:23,448 --> 00:28:27,157
This will be for the family
and the one in my pantry is for the staff,

429
00:28:27,243 --> 00:28:29,359
or, more precisely, me.

430
00:28:29,454 --> 00:28:31,320
We don't normally provide two.

431
00:28:31,414 --> 00:28:33,541
Then perhaps we should find
another supplier.

432
00:28:33,625 --> 00:28:35,707
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hold your horses.

433
00:28:35,793 --> 00:28:39,377
All right, where do you see
this other telephone?

434
00:28:39,464 --> 00:28:41,501
Here, in the outer hall.

435
00:28:45,803 --> 00:28:47,555
Good afternoon, Carson. Is Lady Edith in?

436
00:28:47,639 --> 00:28:50,597
I am! I most certainly am!

437
00:28:51,309 --> 00:28:53,300
-I was just driving past...
-Yes?

438
00:28:53,394 --> 00:28:56,522
...and I thought you might like to come
for a spin, if you're not too busy.

439

Wait till I get my coat!

Oh, this is Mr. Bromidge, milady.
He's here about the telephone.

Oh, please make your notes,
dear Mr. Bromidge.

there'd be an actual operation.

00:55:34,115 --> 00:55:37,107
And we'll celebrate
after we've finished today's work.

826
00:55:37,243 --> 00:55:39,109
Of course, Mrs. Hughes.

827
00:55:41,581 --> 00:55:44,118
-I don't suppose...
-MRS HUGHES: Lady Sybil.

828
00:55:45,501 --> 00:55:47,242
Her ladyship was asking after you.

829
00:55:55,469 --> 00:55:57,426
Be careful, my lad.

830
00:55:57,513 --> 00:56:00,631
Or you'll end up with no job
and a broken heart.

831
00:56:01,017 --> 00:56:02,132
What do you mean?

832
00:56:09,483 --> 00:56:13,943
-I don't seem to be able to find your sister.
-I wonder where she is.

833
00:56:14,030 --> 00:56:15,697
Of course, she may have been cornered.

834
00:56:15,781 --> 00:56:18,481
I know there was some old bore
she was trying to dodge.

835
00:56:18,619 --> 00:56:21,532
-Ah, who was that?
-I'm not sure.

836
00:56:21,663 --> 00:56:25,748
He's simply ghastly, apparently,
but he's promised to propose today.

837
00:56:25,834 --> 00:56:28,545
I can't tell you how funny she was
when she acted it out.

838
00:56:28,629 --> 00:56:31,712
-She ought to go on the stage.
-Really?

839
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:33,501
Ah, how amusing.

840
00:56:35,844 --> 00:56:40,259
Well done, Mrs. Hughes.
Beautifully executed, as always.

841
00:56:40,349 --> 00:56:42,181
The key is in the planning.

842
00:56:42,809 --> 00:56:44,477
Mr. Carson, this probably isn't the moment,

843
00:56:44,561 --> 00:56:48,475
but I've just heard from Dr. Clarkson
I've been accepted for a training scheme

844
00:56:48,565 --> 00:56:50,021
for the army medical corps.

845
00:56:50,150 --> 00:56:52,068
-Have you indeed?
-Yes, and I want to do it.

846
00:56:52,152 --> 00:56:55,736
So I'll be handing in my notice.
I'll serve out the month, of course.

847
00:56:56,239 --> 00:56:59,402
Thank you, Thomas.
We can talk about it later.

848
00:57:02,205 --> 00:57:05,869
And you couldn't have planned that
any better, either.

849
00:57:07,502 --> 00:57:08,867
[CHUCKLES]

850
00:57:09,796 --> 00:57:12,914
-You can't be leaving yet!
-I'm afraid I must.

851
00:57:13,591 --> 00:57:16,379
Please, make my excuses to your mother.

852
00:57:17,470 --> 00:57:18,710
But...

853
00:57:49,503 --> 00:57:51,995
I wish you'd come inside, milady.

854
00:57:52,339 --> 00:57:53,420
No.

855
00:57:55,426 --> 00:57:58,088
People mustn't think I'm really ill.

856
00:57:59,805 --> 00:58:02,923
I don't want to cast a
dampener on the party.

857
00:58:03,475 --> 00:58:04,931
Very well.

858
00:58:06,103 --> 00:58:09,687
But are you sure you have everything
you need, milady?

859
00:58:13,944 --> 00:58:15,434
Dear O'Brien.

860
00:58:18,490 --> 00:58:20,276
How sweet you are.

861
00:58:27,125 --> 00:58:29,287
O'Brien! O'Brien!

862
00:58:30,628 --> 00:58:32,084
Can I have a word?

863
00:58:32,172 --> 00:58:35,049
I need a favor and I don't want
to bother Lady Grantham with it.

864
00:58:35,133 --> 00:58:36,589
Certainly, milady.

865
00:58:36,676 --> 00:58:38,667
She's been helping me find a new maid

866
00:58:38,803 --> 00:58:41,795
and we've had quite a few answers
from her advertisement.

867
00:58:42,307 --> 00:58:43,557
Can you find where she's put them

868
00:58:43,641 --> 00:58:46,053
and get Branson to bring them
to the Dower House?

869
00:58:46,644 --> 00:58:48,896
Her ladyship was helping you
find a new lady's maid?

870
00:58:48,980 --> 00:58:51,972
Yes. We should have asked you, really.

871
00:58:52,901 --> 00:58:55,814
You might take a look at the letters
if you have a minute.

872
00:58:55,904 --> 00:58:59,738
There's one we liked the sound of,
who'd been trained in Paris.

873
00:59:01,910 --> 00:59:04,322
Do you know where
she might have put them?

874
00:59:05,580 --> 00:59:07,036
The answers?

875
00:59:07,832 --> 00:59:11,003
Oh, yes, milady. There are only
two or three places they could be.

876
00:59:11,087 --> 00:59:15,752
Oh! Thank you, O'Brien.
You're a treasure. Thank you.

877
00:59:21,388 --> 00:59:24,801
I didn't know a garden party
was a spectator sport.

878
00:59:24,892 --> 00:59:27,008
Pretty, though, isn't it?

879
00:59:27,728 --> 00:59:31,106
Hard to believe the clouds are gathering
on a summer's day like this.

880
00:59:31,190 --> 00:59:36,356
Mr. Bates, I know you think I was wrong
to call on your mother.

881
00:59:36,445 --> 00:59:38,277
I don't think that.

882
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:41,197
She likes you, by the way.

883
00:59:42,952 --> 00:59:44,818
I had to find out the truth.

884
00:59:44,912 --> 00:59:47,779
But you see, you don't know
the whole truth, not even now.

885
00:59:47,873 --> 00:59:50,323
-You know my mother's truth.
-But not your wife's?

886
00:59:53,797 --> 00:59:56,710
-Where is she now?
-I couldn't tell you.

887
01:00:00,428 --> 01:00:02,260
I'd better get back.

888
01:00:07,644 --> 01:00:09,812
You're here, Mr. Molesley?
I didn't know that.

889
01:00:09,896 --> 01:00:11,557
Just helping out.

890
01:00:12,816 --> 01:00:14,477
Nice girl, that Anna.

891
01:00:15,152 --> 01:00:17,702
Do you know if she's got anyone special
in her life?

892
01:00:18,071 --> 01:00:20,278
I'd like to say she hasn't.

893
01:00:20,657 --> 01:00:23,740
I would, truly.
But I'm afraid there is someone.

894
01:00:23,827 --> 01:00:26,569
And do you think he's keen on her?
Or is it worth a go?

895
01:00:26,663 --> 01:00:31,783
Well, he keeps himself to himself,
and he's very hard to read at times,

896
01:00:33,128 --> 01:00:36,838
but I'd say he's keen.
I'd say he's very keen indeed.

897
01:00:40,094 --> 01:00:44,383
Daisy! I said ices, not iced cakes!

898
01:00:44,473 --> 01:00:46,683
Now, unclog your ears
and get these to William

899
01:00:46,767 --> 01:00:48,929
before they turn into soup!

900
01:00:51,772 --> 01:00:55,022
-But I don't understand, nothing's changed.
-Everything's changed.

901
01:00:55,276 --> 01:00:58,570
You can't be sure I was going to
refuse you, even if it had been a boy.

902
01:00:58,654 --> 01:01:01,191
-Because I'm not.
-That's the point.

903
01:01:01,282 --> 01:01:04,900
I can't be sure.
Of you, or of anything, it seems.

904
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:07,079
The last few weeks have taught me that.

905
01:01:07,163 --> 01:01:08,824
But you can't leave Downton.

906
01:01:09,415 --> 01:01:11,452
I can't stay. Not now.

907
01:01:12,168 --> 01:01:13,668
Well, what will you tell Papa?

908
01:01:14,503 --> 01:01:19,374
That I'm grateful for what he's trying
to do, but the experiment is at an end.

909
01:01:20,469 --> 01:01:23,803
I'm not a puppet.
I must take charge of my own life again.

910
01:01:25,390 --> 01:01:28,599
Would you have stayed,
if I'd accepted you?

911
01:01:31,521 --> 01:01:32,727
Of course.

912
01:01:34,650 --> 01:01:37,233
So I've ruined everything?

913
01:01:37,527 --> 01:01:43,068
You've shown me I've been living in a
dream, and it's time to return to real life.

914
01:01:45,118 --> 01:01:47,280
Wish me luck with it, Mary.

915
01:01:47,788 --> 01:01:50,325
God knows I wish the best for you.

916
01:02:05,181 --> 01:02:06,763
Well, Rosamund.

917
01:02:07,141 --> 01:02:12,011
I'm afraid your meddling has cost Mary
the only decent offer she'll ever get.

918
01:02:12,397 --> 01:02:16,356
I'm sorry, Mama, but you know me.
I have to say what I think.

919
01:02:16,776 --> 01:02:19,985
Why? Nobody else does.

920
01:02:31,124 --> 01:02:33,286
Are you quite well, milady?

921
01:02:33,501 --> 01:02:36,789
Of course! You know me, Carson.

922
01:02:38,214 --> 01:02:40,296
I'm never down for long.

923
01:02:43,886 --> 01:02:45,343
[SOBBING]

924
01:02:47,641 --> 01:02:50,008
I know you have spirit, milady.

925
01:02:50,811 --> 01:02:54,600
And that's what counts.
It's all that counts in the end.

926
01:02:58,902 --> 01:03:00,392
There, there.

927
01:03:02,281 --> 01:03:06,616
So Mary is to be denied
her countess's coronet after all?

928
01:03:06,702 --> 01:03:08,158
Don't crow at me.

929
01:03:08,245 --> 01:03:11,122
I think she was very foolish
not to take him when she could.

930
01:03:11,206 --> 01:03:12,947
And I told her so.

931
01:03:13,042 --> 01:03:14,125
Well, if I'm perfectly honest,

932
01:03:14,209 --> 01:03:17,702
I wonder if Matthew isn't making
the same mistake right now.

933
01:03:24,470 --> 01:03:26,302
Are you warm enough?

934
01:03:26,972 --> 01:03:29,465
I am when you're holding my hand.

935
01:03:29,684 --> 01:03:33,473
-Your lordship, this has just arrived for you.
-Thank you.

936
01:03:33,980 --> 01:03:37,564
Oh, and I'm happy to tell you
that Thomas has just handed in his notice.

937
01:03:38,276 --> 01:03:41,143
So we'll be spared any unpleasantness
on that score.

938
01:03:41,696 --> 01:03:43,687
What a relief!

939
01:03:57,545 --> 01:04:00,378
Please, would you stop, please.

940
01:04:00,465 --> 01:04:05,130
My lords, ladies and gentlemen,
can I ask for silence?

941
01:04:08,807 --> 01:04:14,724
Because I very much regret to announce
that we are at war with Germany.
