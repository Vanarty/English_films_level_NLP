1
00:00:02,046 --> 00:00:06,083
You lose,
we don't merge.

2
00:00:06,167 --> 00:00:08,135
You win,
you get what you want.

3
00:00:08,202 --> 00:00:10,087
You lose,
you stay.

4
00:00:10,171 --> 00:00:12,305
You extend
your noncompete,

5
00:00:12,373 --> 00:00:16,009
and you get a chance to earn
your name on the door,

6
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:18,044
because it's not
going up there now.

7
00:00:18,096 --> 00:00:19,379
There's no room
for both of us.

8
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:22,716
Unless we made room
for each other.

9
00:00:22,767 --> 00:00:24,434
I put him on the list,
and I handed it in.

10
00:00:24,519 --> 00:00:27,437
He didn't put you
on his list.

11
00:00:27,522 --> 00:00:28,905
- I won't.
- You will.

12
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:30,190
Harvey will never
forgive me.

13
00:00:30,241 --> 00:00:31,881
This is a letter
to the district attorney,

14
00:00:31,909 --> 00:00:35,362
saying that you
are breaking the law.

15
00:00:35,413 --> 00:00:38,915
You file your motion,

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,367
I'll file mine.

17
00:00:40,418 --> 00:00:41,501
You weren't there.

18
00:00:41,569 --> 00:00:42,890
- I didn't have to be.
- Jessica--

19
00:00:42,903 --> 00:00:44,454
You don't work for Jessica.
You work for me.

20
00:00:44,539 --> 00:00:47,240
You're fired.
No, he's not.

21
00:00:47,291 --> 00:00:48,925
You could've just told me
that you didn't love me

22
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:50,577
instead of selling me out.

23
00:00:50,628 --> 00:00:52,512
I didn't sell you out,
Scottie.

24
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:54,297
I just got fired.

25
00:00:54,382 --> 00:00:55,799
Whatever she did,

26
00:00:55,883 --> 00:00:57,523
you wouldn't have this merger
without her.

27
00:00:57,585 --> 00:01:00,520
Would you have her work here
or in London?

28
00:01:00,588 --> 00:01:02,589
You're going
to stay here,

29
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,775
be humble,

30
00:01:04,859 --> 00:01:06,693
and learn
your goddamn place.

31
00:01:06,761 --> 00:01:09,229
I never went
to Harvard.

32
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,230
What?

33
00:01:10,281 --> 00:01:13,066
I'm a fraud.

34
00:01:50,104 --> 00:01:51,137
Hey.

35
00:01:51,189 --> 00:01:52,589
I got your message.
What's going on?

36
00:01:52,607 --> 00:01:55,776
Partners meeting.
Essential personnel only.

37
00:01:55,827 --> 00:01:56,867
In the middle
of the night?

38
00:01:56,911 --> 00:01:58,445
You afraid
of the dark?

39
00:01:58,496 --> 00:01:59,830
I wouldn't be if I had
my Cookie Monster with me.

40
00:01:59,914 --> 00:02:01,081
Well, then go get him,

41
00:02:01,148 --> 00:02:03,917
because we're finalizing
the terms of the merger.

42
00:02:03,984 --> 00:02:04,918
We?

43
00:02:04,985 --> 00:02:06,369
We.

44
00:02:06,454 --> 00:02:08,288
So I'm a partner now?

45
00:02:08,339 --> 00:02:09,706
Easy, Marcia Clark.

46
00:02:09,791 --> 00:02:11,875
Jessica and I
discussed it.

47
00:02:11,959 --> 00:02:14,094
You're responsible
for making this merger happen.

48
00:02:14,161 --> 00:02:15,595
You deserve
to be here.

49
00:02:15,663 --> 00:02:17,764
So Jessica and you
talked?

50
00:02:17,832 --> 00:02:18,765
You forgave her?

51
00:02:18,833 --> 00:02:20,834
She won.
I lost.

52
00:02:20,885 --> 00:02:21,852
Nothing to forgive.

53
00:02:21,936 --> 00:02:24,020
And me?

54
00:02:24,105 --> 00:02:27,224
You did
what you had to do.

55
00:02:29,176 --> 00:02:33,196
You have no idea
how much I needed to hear that.

56
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:37,067
The merger is complete.

57
00:02:37,151 --> 00:02:38,351
And we would like
to show everyone

58
00:02:38,402 --> 00:02:40,954
that the new Darby Pearson
will be stronger,

59
00:02:41,021 --> 00:02:42,355
better connected--

60
00:02:42,406 --> 00:02:44,791
And most importantly,
based on a foundation that is--

61
00:02:44,859 --> 00:02:45,909
Full of shit.

62
00:02:45,993 --> 00:02:46,993
What the hell's
going on?

63
00:02:47,044 --> 00:02:49,412
- I told her.
- Told her what?

64
00:02:49,497 --> 00:02:51,131
That Mike Ross
is a fraud,

65
00:02:51,198 --> 00:02:52,966
and I am not going
to let him get away with it.

66
00:02:53,033 --> 00:02:54,084
How could you do this?

67
00:02:54,168 --> 00:02:56,536
You did this
to yourself.

68
00:03:05,179 --> 00:03:07,898
How long are you going
to keep staring at that offer?

69
00:03:07,982 --> 00:03:09,432
Until one of us blinks.

70
00:03:09,517 --> 00:03:11,184
Deron signed it.
You said it was great.

71
00:03:11,235 --> 00:03:12,519
I'm not interested
in great.

72
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:15,889
I want it to know
who its daddy is.

73
00:03:19,443 --> 00:03:20,660
What is it, Donna?

74
00:03:20,728 --> 00:03:24,497
It's Sunday night.
Darby needs an answer.

75
00:03:24,565 --> 00:03:27,000
London.
Send her to London.

76
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,909
Do you want
to talk about it?

77
00:03:38,296 --> 00:03:40,013
Have Ray
meet me downstairs.

78
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,015
And where should I say
you're going?

79
00:03:42,082 --> 00:03:44,100
Brooklyn.

80
00:04:04,372 --> 00:04:06,706
I did not expect
the great Harvey Specter

81
00:04:06,774 --> 00:04:07,707
to come all the way
to Brooklyn

82
00:04:07,775 --> 00:04:09,242
just to deliver
a contract.

83
00:04:09,293 --> 00:04:11,328
That's good,
'cause I came for the hot dogs.

84
00:04:11,412 --> 00:04:13,463
I told you,
that was our final offer.

85
00:04:13,547 --> 00:04:15,081
You did,
but the third quarter's

86
00:04:15,132 --> 00:04:16,750
about to end,
and if you want Deron Williams

87
00:04:16,801 --> 00:04:19,619
playing for you
in the fourth,

88
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:22,222
this is his number.

89
00:04:23,841 --> 00:04:25,058
Even if you had
another offer,

90
00:04:25,125 --> 00:04:26,459
which you don't,

91
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:29,145
he can't leave
in the middle of a game.

92
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:30,730
I was talking
about the fourth quarter

93
00:04:30,798 --> 00:04:32,015
of game seven,

94
00:04:32,099 --> 00:04:33,900
when you're looking
to lock up a championship,

95
00:04:33,901 --> 00:04:36,903
because the question isn't
"do you want Deron or not?"

96
00:04:36,971 --> 00:04:39,639
It's "do you want
a ring or not?"

97
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:41,074
You got nothing.

98
00:04:41,141 --> 00:04:43,276
And I told you,
that's my final offer.

99
00:04:43,327 --> 00:04:44,277
Then I guess I'll just have
to go bring Deron

100
00:04:44,328 --> 00:04:45,445
his new Mavs jersey then.

101
00:04:45,496 --> 00:04:47,364
There's no way
Mark Cuban pays that much.

102
00:04:47,448 --> 00:04:48,648
Why don't you call him
and ask?

103
00:04:48,699 --> 00:04:51,284
Oh, wait, you can't,
because he hates you.

104
00:04:51,335 --> 00:04:52,285
Bullshit.

105
00:04:52,336 --> 00:04:53,370
We may not
be blood brothers,

106
00:04:53,454 --> 00:04:54,371
but he doesn't
hate me.

107
00:04:54,455 --> 00:04:55,872
Oh, he does now.

108
00:04:55,957 --> 00:05:00,260
Evidently, he found out
about that thing from last May.

109
00:05:00,327 --> 00:05:01,344
How do you know that?

110
00:05:01,429 --> 00:05:03,830
Because I was there
when I told him.

111
00:05:03,881 --> 00:05:05,598
You have
until 10:00 a.m.

112
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:07,017
Then I'm calling Dallas.

113
00:05:07,101 --> 00:05:09,335
And Mark may not
take your call,

114
00:05:09,387 --> 00:05:13,356
but he'll sure as hell
take mine.

115
00:05:13,441 --> 00:05:14,607
How do I know
you're not going to turn around

116
00:05:14,675 --> 00:05:15,725
and get him
to pay more?

117
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:16,943
You don't.

118
00:05:17,011 --> 00:05:18,445
But if you don't
match this,

119
00:05:18,512 --> 00:05:20,897
you'll never find out.

120
00:05:35,029 --> 00:05:36,296
Jessica.

121
00:05:36,363 --> 00:05:37,330
Harvey.

122
00:05:37,381 --> 00:05:39,332
I don't recall
giving you my key.

123
00:05:39,383 --> 00:05:41,418
I don't recall authorizing you
to negotiate

124
00:05:41,502 --> 00:05:42,869
behind Deron Williams' back.

125
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,220
His back
is just fine.

126
00:05:44,305 --> 00:05:46,172
I'm standing
right behind it.

127
00:05:46,223 --> 00:05:49,709
Then why is the contract
he signed in my hand?

128
00:05:51,762 --> 00:05:52,979
How much
did you ask for?

129
00:05:53,047 --> 00:05:55,181
Triple.

130
00:05:55,232 --> 00:05:56,733
You out of your mind?

131
00:05:56,817 --> 00:05:57,767
We have leverage.

132
00:05:57,852 --> 00:06:00,353
And what is that?

133
00:06:00,404 --> 00:06:02,522
- It's complicated.
- Simplify it for me.

134
00:06:02,573 --> 00:06:04,724
- I bluffed him.
- That's not leverage.

135
00:06:04,775 --> 00:06:05,825
It is
if he believes it.

136
00:06:05,893 --> 00:06:07,444
And if it fails,
he fires us

137
00:06:07,528 --> 00:06:09,162
and takes ten other players
with him.

138
00:06:09,229 --> 00:06:10,830
Then it better not fail.

139
00:06:10,898 --> 00:06:13,616
You asked the man
for triple.

140
00:06:13,701 --> 00:06:15,581
If I had what I said I had,
that's what I'd get.

141
00:06:15,619 --> 00:06:18,204
I don't ask for triple,
he knows I'm bluffing.

142
00:06:18,255 --> 00:06:19,789
Then don't bluff
in the first place.

143
00:06:19,874 --> 00:06:22,675
I'm afraid
that's what I do.

144
00:06:22,743 --> 00:06:23,877
You know
what I think?

145
00:06:23,928 --> 00:06:25,178
I think you want it
to fail.

146
00:06:25,245 --> 00:06:26,596
I think
you're stuck

147
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,680
with a merger
you don't want

148
00:06:27,748 --> 00:06:29,682
and a noncompete
you can't stand,

149
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:31,384
and you're trying
to get me to fire you.

150
00:06:31,435 --> 00:06:33,269
I could bust
that noncompete wide open.

151
00:06:33,354 --> 00:06:34,637
But you gave me
your word.

152
00:06:34,722 --> 00:06:36,940
Which is
why I'm staying.

153
00:06:37,024 --> 00:06:39,442
Jessica, I've always
operated this way.

154
00:06:39,527 --> 00:06:42,195
It's what you hired me for,
it's what you pay me for,

155
00:06:42,262 --> 00:06:44,364
and it used to be
what you valued me for.

156
00:06:44,431 --> 00:06:45,565
I'm not going
to fire you.

157
00:06:45,616 --> 00:06:47,984
Neither is Deron Williams.

158
00:06:48,069 --> 00:06:49,452
Nets just caved.

159
00:06:49,537 --> 00:06:52,655
So unless you're looking
to cook me breakfast tomorrow,

160
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,207
I'd say we're done.

161
00:07:04,668 --> 00:07:06,469
I told you
I needed time.

162
00:07:06,554 --> 00:07:07,754
I know,
but it's been two days,

163
00:07:07,788 --> 00:07:08,721
and I can't
take it anymore.

164
00:07:08,789 --> 00:07:11,925
I had to see you.

165
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:20,350
I don't want any comments
about how messy the place is.

166
00:07:20,434 --> 00:07:21,968
Okay.

167
00:07:22,019 --> 00:07:26,906
And what would clean
look like?

168
00:07:26,974 --> 00:07:29,642
Don't even think
about it.

169
00:07:29,693 --> 00:07:32,311
I can't not think
about it, all right?

170
00:07:32,363 --> 00:07:34,280
It's all I've been able
to think about for two days.

171
00:07:34,331 --> 00:07:36,032
Mike, why are you here?

172
00:07:36,117 --> 00:07:38,618
Because that's not going
to happen.

173
00:07:38,669 --> 00:07:39,986
Now or ever?

174
00:07:40,037 --> 00:07:42,839
You lied to me
about everything.

175
00:07:42,923 --> 00:07:44,174
Rachel--

176
00:07:44,258 --> 00:07:45,208
Do you remember
when I told you I needed time?

177
00:07:45,292 --> 00:07:46,826
That's what
I needed it for--

178
00:07:46,877 --> 00:07:49,429
to process this bomb
that you dropped on me.

179
00:07:49,496 --> 00:07:53,633
I had a nightmare.

180
00:07:53,684 --> 00:07:55,135
You asked why I'm here.
That's why.

181
00:07:55,186 --> 00:07:57,604
I--

182
00:07:57,671 --> 00:07:59,439
you exposed me
to the entire firm.

183
00:07:59,506 --> 00:08:01,307
- I would never do that.
- I know.

184
00:08:01,358 --> 00:08:02,842
And I woke up,
and I realized

185
00:08:02,893 --> 00:08:04,811
that the real nightmare
wouldn't even be that.

186
00:08:04,862 --> 00:08:09,282
The real nightmare
would be--

187
00:08:09,349 --> 00:08:12,986
would be if you didn't want
to be with me.

188
00:08:13,037 --> 00:08:14,320
Do you really
mean that?

189
00:08:14,371 --> 00:08:17,457
I meant it
the first time I ever saw you.

190
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:24,747
Rachel, I know that I'm not
who you want me to be,

191
00:08:24,832 --> 00:08:26,966
but--but you know
what happened in that room.

192
00:08:27,034 --> 00:08:28,218
You know
what we both felt.

193
00:08:28,302 --> 00:08:30,303
I--

194
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:32,672
I don't want
to lose that.

195
00:08:35,226 --> 00:08:37,310
I just keep wishing
you never told me.

196
00:08:37,377 --> 00:08:40,680
But then it never
would have happened.

197
00:08:40,731 --> 00:08:43,049
And it did.

198
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:44,767
And I'm--

199
00:08:44,852 --> 00:08:46,903
I'm really glad
that it did.

200
00:08:48,355 --> 00:08:52,025
I am too.

201
00:08:52,076 --> 00:08:53,943
But what happens
if you get caught?

202
00:08:54,028 --> 00:08:57,363
Because what you had
may have been a nightmare, Mike,

203
00:08:57,414 --> 00:08:58,531
but you can't tell me
you're not afraid

204
00:08:58,582 --> 00:08:59,532
of being exposed.

205
00:08:59,583 --> 00:09:00,833
Of course I am.

206
00:09:00,901 --> 00:09:03,336
But there's nothing
that I can do about it.

207
00:09:03,403 --> 00:09:06,289
Well, maybe there is.

208
00:09:06,373 --> 00:09:08,675
What are you saying?

209
00:09:08,742 --> 00:09:11,294
Quit.

210
00:09:11,378 --> 00:09:13,945
Go in tomorrow,
and just quit.

222
00:10:53,518 --> 00:10:55,102
I need to talk to you.

223
00:10:55,169 --> 00:10:57,304
You want to talk
about how things played out,

224
00:10:57,355 --> 00:11:00,724
but the place to do that
is somewhere more private.

225
00:11:00,809 --> 00:11:04,278
You didn't just come through
on the merger.

226
00:11:04,345 --> 00:11:05,946
You bluffed Hardman,

227
00:11:06,013 --> 00:11:08,315
turned Monica Eton,

228
00:11:08,366 --> 00:11:09,616
and put us over the top
on Folsom Foods.

229
00:11:09,684 --> 00:11:11,985
Now that's a lot
of coming through in the clutch.

230
00:11:12,036 --> 00:11:14,321
And I wouldn't have saved
your ass

231
00:11:14,372 --> 00:11:17,741
if I didn't think
you deserved to be here.

232
00:11:17,826 --> 00:11:18,992
I don't know
what to say.

233
00:11:19,043 --> 00:11:20,911
Well, the usual response is
"thank you."

234
00:11:20,995 --> 00:11:22,296
The usual road
to getting here

235
00:11:22,363 --> 00:11:24,331
doesn't involve
stabbing someone in the back.

236
00:11:24,382 --> 00:11:27,551
Doesn't it?

237
00:11:29,671 --> 00:11:31,338
When I was 16,

238
00:11:31,389 --> 00:11:33,307
I came home,
my mother sat me down,

239
00:11:33,374 --> 00:11:35,476
and said my parents
were separating.

240
00:11:35,543 --> 00:11:38,095
Trial basis.

241
00:11:38,179 --> 00:11:41,064
But the good news was
she was going to get me a car

242
00:11:41,149 --> 00:11:42,683
to help with my sister.

243
00:11:42,734 --> 00:11:46,353
All my friends talked about
how lucky I was to have it.

244
00:11:46,404 --> 00:11:49,740
I hated that car.

245
00:11:49,824 --> 00:11:52,910
Every time I got in it, I--

246
00:11:52,994 --> 00:11:54,912
it just reminded me.

247
00:11:54,996 --> 00:11:57,030
Why are you telling me this?

248
00:11:57,081 --> 00:11:59,166
Because five years later,

249
00:11:59,233 --> 00:12:03,570
that same car got me to Harvard,
which led me here.

250
00:12:03,621 --> 00:12:05,756
So you can think
of this office

251
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:09,092
as a reminder
of what you did to Harvey

252
00:12:09,177 --> 00:12:12,129
or as a symbol
of what you can accomplish

253
00:12:12,213 --> 00:12:14,298
at the firm.

254
00:12:14,382 --> 00:12:17,751
Now, do you still
have something to say?

255
00:12:17,802 --> 00:12:20,938
No.

256
00:12:21,022 --> 00:12:23,357
No, I don't.

257
00:12:26,027 --> 00:12:28,028
They ever get back together?

258
00:12:28,095 --> 00:12:30,931
No.

259
00:12:30,982 --> 00:12:34,401
No, they didn't.

260
00:12:45,613 --> 00:12:48,215
Ah, God!
Damn it!

261
00:12:48,282 --> 00:12:49,299
Louis, what happened?

262
00:12:49,384 --> 00:12:51,134
Oh.
I'll tell you what happened.

263
00:12:51,219 --> 00:12:52,252
This stupid merger.

264
00:12:52,303 --> 00:12:53,420
It's bad enough
my vote is worth

265
00:12:53,471 --> 00:12:54,638
1/3 of what it was
last week.

266
00:12:54,722 --> 00:12:56,173
Now our uni-balls, gone.

267
00:12:56,257 --> 00:12:57,641
Our...What?

268
00:12:57,725 --> 00:12:58,725
Pens, Donna.

269
00:12:58,793 --> 00:13:00,143
The new quartermaster,

270
00:13:00,228 --> 00:13:03,630
Barbara L. Tottingham, will not
buy us any more uni-balls.

271
00:13:03,681 --> 00:13:06,633
There's not one single uni-ball
in this entire firm.

272
00:13:06,684 --> 00:13:08,769
- Please stop saying uni-ball.
- No, I will not.

273
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:10,988
Stuck
with these stupid plastic things

274
00:13:11,072 --> 00:13:12,272
that keep breaking.

275
00:13:12,323 --> 00:13:14,074
So buy your own pen.

276
00:13:14,141 --> 00:13:16,777
Bu

277
00:13:16,828 --> 00:13:18,912
okay.

278
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:20,080
There are two things
in this firm

279
00:13:20,147 --> 00:13:22,366
that I hold very sacred--
my uni-balls

280
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:24,117
and my raspberry Bran bars.

281
00:13:24,168 --> 00:13:25,586
And if I have to go
and buy 'em myself,

282
00:13:25,653 --> 00:13:28,255
well, then,
this Barbara L. Tottingham

283
00:13:28,322 --> 00:13:29,840
has a message for me,
loud and clear,

284
00:13:29,924 --> 00:13:31,258
and that's "Louis Litt,
go screw yourself."

285
00:13:31,325 --> 00:13:32,960
Louis, the ink on your face.
You've got just, like--

286
00:13:33,011 --> 00:13:34,294
you've got, like,
a little bit right there.

287
00:13:34,345 --> 00:13:36,129
Where, here?

288
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:38,465
No, I think you've gotta
give it, like, a good--

289
00:13:38,516 --> 00:13:39,466
Okay, fine.

290
00:13:39,517 --> 00:13:41,935
Gone?

291
00:13:42,003 --> 00:13:44,304
Thank you, Donna.
You're a true friend.

292
00:13:44,355 --> 00:13:45,772
I got your back.

293
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,140
Hey, do you remember

294
00:13:47,191 --> 00:13:48,842
when you used to do
those rotator cuff exercises?

295
00:13:48,893 --> 00:13:50,343
Oh, yeah,
what are you kidding? Of course.

296
00:13:50,395 --> 00:13:52,779
Every day for, like, 18 months.
Why do you ask?

297
00:13:52,847 --> 00:13:55,282
No reason.

298
00:13:59,203 --> 00:14:01,204
Edward.

299
00:14:01,289 --> 00:14:02,823
Jessica,
how lovely to see you.

300
00:14:02,874 --> 00:14:04,408
I wanted to thank you.

301
00:14:04,492 --> 00:14:06,910
- Ah. You saw the sign.
- Mm-hmm.

302
00:14:06,995 --> 00:14:08,412
You didn't have
to do that.

303
00:14:08,496 --> 00:14:10,247
Our agreement stipulates
Darby Pearson,

304
00:14:10,331 --> 00:14:11,748
not Pearson Darby.

305
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:16,053
Our agreement also stipulates
a 51/49 percentage structure.

306
00:14:16,137 --> 00:14:17,704
And this is your way
of showing me

307
00:14:17,755 --> 00:14:19,306
that you think of it
as 50/50.

308
00:14:19,373 --> 00:14:21,475
- Merely a gesture.
- Ah.

309
00:14:21,542 --> 00:14:22,759
Heck of a gesture.

310
00:14:22,844 --> 00:14:24,711
How would you propose
to a woman?

311
00:14:24,762 --> 00:14:25,929
A woman?

312
00:14:26,014 --> 00:14:28,598
I think we both know that--
Yes, we do.

313
00:14:28,683 --> 00:14:30,734
Anyway...

314
00:14:30,818 --> 00:14:32,569
It is shaping up
to be a lovely day.

315
00:14:32,654 --> 00:14:33,987
Oh, I wish
I could say that same.

316
00:14:34,055 --> 00:14:35,656
I assume you know
about the latest goings-on

317
00:14:35,723 --> 00:14:37,057
with Hessington Oil.

318
00:14:37,108 --> 00:14:39,076
I wouldn't be much
of a partner if I didn't.

319
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:42,279
Now they've decide to take on
Ava Hessington personally.

320
00:14:42,363 --> 00:14:44,498
- Who is they?
- The U.S. government.

321
00:14:44,565 --> 00:14:46,450
I've decided to let Harvey
handle it.

322
00:14:46,534 --> 00:14:48,669
- Why?
- Why not?

323
00:14:48,736 --> 00:14:49,903
It's not a good time.

324
00:14:49,954 --> 00:14:51,955
He's still digesting
the merger.

325
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,840
- Meaning?
- He's acting out.

326
00:14:53,908 --> 00:14:55,375
Well, he may be
acting out,

327
00:14:55,426 --> 00:14:58,345
but I understand he just got
his client triple the money.

328
00:14:58,412 --> 00:15:01,014
By taking a huge risk
he didn't have to.

329
00:15:01,082 --> 00:15:02,883
This case,
he may have to.

330
00:15:02,934 --> 00:15:05,085
So that's why Harvey.

331
00:15:05,136 --> 00:15:08,305
And this case is more
important to me than just money.

332
00:15:08,389 --> 00:15:10,557
And why is that?

333
00:15:10,608 --> 00:15:13,110
Because it is.

334
00:15:15,429 --> 00:15:16,596
What if I said no?

335
00:15:16,647 --> 00:15:19,265
I'm afraid that's not an option.

336
00:15:19,317 --> 00:15:21,868
So I guess
that sign

337
00:15:21,936 --> 00:15:24,071
really doesn't mean 50/50
after all.

338
00:15:24,122 --> 00:15:26,740
I did say
it was merely a gesture.

339
00:15:26,791 --> 00:15:29,876
Hmm.

340
00:15:29,944 --> 00:15:31,912
You keep showing up
to surprise me,

341
00:15:31,963 --> 00:15:33,613
people are gonna
get the wrong idea.

342
00:15:33,664 --> 00:15:36,133
People are going to think
what they're going to think.

343
00:15:36,217 --> 00:15:38,752
I'm here to bury the hatchet.
And what prompted that?

344
00:15:38,803 --> 00:15:41,088
Darby found out what you did
with Deron Williams.

345
00:15:41,139 --> 00:15:42,789
Don't tell me.
He was impressed.

346
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,624
He was pissed.

347
00:15:44,675 --> 00:15:45,792
Thinks you're trying
to get fired.

348
00:15:45,843 --> 00:15:47,677
And you told him
how smart he was.

349
00:15:47,762 --> 00:15:50,013
I told him
you said it wasn't true

350
00:15:50,098 --> 00:15:51,598
and that I believed you,

351
00:15:51,649 --> 00:15:54,267
and then I fought to give you
a chance to prove it.

352
00:15:54,318 --> 00:15:56,636
Ava Hessington.

353
00:15:56,687 --> 00:15:57,637
I got you on it.

354
00:15:57,688 --> 00:15:58,805
What does that matter
to me?

355
00:15:58,856 --> 00:15:59,906
Harvey,

356
00:15:59,974 --> 00:16:02,308
I know you and I
have had our problems,

357
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,361
but this is a chance
for us to move past it.

358
00:16:04,445 --> 00:16:05,612
Let's take it.

359
00:16:05,663 --> 00:16:07,531
You really do
wanna make up.

360
00:16:07,615 --> 00:16:09,533
I never wanted to be at odds
in the first place.

361
00:16:09,617 --> 00:16:13,286
Neither did I.

362
00:16:13,337 --> 00:16:15,589
Are we good?

363
00:16:15,656 --> 00:16:18,208
Don't you wanna tell me
I better win this goddamn case?

364
00:16:18,292 --> 00:16:19,993
I didn't think
I had to.

365
00:16:20,044 --> 00:16:21,605
Never stopped you
from saying it before.

366
00:16:21,629 --> 00:16:24,548
Well, I'm learning
to let go.

367
00:16:25,683 --> 00:16:27,884
Oh, Harvey,
there is one more thing.

368
00:16:27,969 --> 00:16:31,638
You better win
this goddamn case.

369
00:16:51,409 --> 00:16:53,026
I know
it's not my place,

370
00:16:53,077 --> 00:16:56,046
but you really suck
at quitting.

371
00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:57,197
I can explain.

372
00:16:57,248 --> 00:17:00,634
No need.
It was just a suggestion.

373
00:17:00,701 --> 00:17:01,968
Rachel, I tried to do it,
but--

374
00:17:02,036 --> 00:17:05,371
But then Jessica
gave you this office to stay?

375
00:17:05,423 --> 00:17:06,873
Actually,
she gave me this office

376
00:17:06,924 --> 00:17:11,011
before I could even
bring it up.

377
00:17:11,062 --> 00:17:12,095
Well, aren't you

378
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:13,346
just the luckiest person
in the world?

379
00:17:13,397 --> 00:17:14,714
Rachel--

380
00:17:14,765 --> 00:17:16,566
You came to me,
you were petrified

381
00:17:16,651 --> 00:17:18,551
of being exposed,
and I gave you a way out.

382
00:17:18,603 --> 00:17:22,022
And now, 12 hours later,
you're in a brand-new office

383
00:17:22,073 --> 00:17:23,323
with a diploma on the wall
that, for all I know,

384
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:24,658
came from Kinko's.

385
00:17:24,725 --> 00:17:26,860
What do you want me to do?
Everyone hangs one.

386
00:17:26,911 --> 00:17:31,231
No, Mike,
everyone doesn't just hang one.

387
00:17:31,282 --> 00:17:32,699
So that's
what this is really about.

388
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:34,734
You're damn right
it is.

389
00:17:34,785 --> 00:17:38,622
I've been trying to earn one
for as long as I can remember.

390
00:17:38,706 --> 00:17:41,174
And you have one and everything
that goes with it,

391
00:17:41,242 --> 00:17:43,677
and you didn't do
a single thing to deserve it.

392
00:17:43,744 --> 00:17:44,794
You have no idea
what I have or haven't done

393
00:17:44,879 --> 00:17:46,379
to get where I am.

394
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:48,715
And that's
the whole problem.

395
00:17:48,766 --> 00:17:51,184
I have no idea
who you are.

396
00:18:26,094 --> 00:18:29,764
Harvey, I'm just in the middle
of a little afternoon crossword.

397
00:18:29,815 --> 00:18:30,932
Are you a puzzler?

398
00:18:30,983 --> 00:18:32,567
Don't you have work
to do?

399
00:18:32,634 --> 00:18:34,134
My dear fellow,
if I have to do work,

400
00:18:34,186 --> 00:18:36,103
then I'm not doing my job.

401
00:18:36,155 --> 00:18:37,104
What can I do
for you?

402
00:18:37,156 --> 00:18:38,489
Jessica told me

403
00:18:38,574 --> 00:18:40,358
that you agreed to let me
be lead on Ava Hessington.

404
00:18:40,442 --> 00:18:41,742
I wanted to thank you.

405
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:44,144
- You're welcome.
- There's just one problem.

406
00:18:44,196 --> 00:18:46,914
You didn't agree to anything.
You demanded it.

407
00:18:46,982 --> 00:18:48,783
And you let Jessica
play good cop

408
00:18:48,834 --> 00:18:51,169
because you didn't wanna
undermine the chain of command.

409
00:18:51,253 --> 00:18:53,120
That's quite
the conspiracy theory.

410
00:18:53,172 --> 00:18:54,655
Well,
here's the good news.

411
00:18:54,706 --> 00:18:56,657
My plate's a little full
right now.

412
00:18:56,708 --> 00:18:59,460
And since you didn't want me
on this case in the first place,

413
00:18:59,511 --> 00:19:01,328
why don't you let
somebody else handle it?

414
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:03,431
Good luck.
I hear it's a tough one.

415
00:19:03,498 --> 00:19:06,333
What do you want?

416
00:19:06,385 --> 00:19:08,102
I want out.

417
00:19:08,169 --> 00:19:09,270
I win this,

418
00:19:09,337 --> 00:19:11,639
you tear up my noncompete,
and you fire me.

419
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:14,008
You hate this merger
that much.

420
00:19:14,059 --> 00:19:15,676
I had an agreement
with Jessica,

421
00:19:15,727 --> 00:19:16,944
and I honored it.

422
00:19:17,012 --> 00:19:19,680
Then she accused me
of trying to get fired.

423
00:19:19,731 --> 00:19:21,199
Then she lied to me

424
00:19:21,283 --> 00:19:22,817
by claiming
that she fought for me

425
00:19:22,868 --> 00:19:24,151
to be on this case.

426
00:19:24,203 --> 00:19:27,371
She really does wanna
make up with you, you know.

427
00:19:27,456 --> 00:19:29,040
Funny way
of showing it.

428
00:19:29,124 --> 00:19:30,491
Ironic.

429
00:19:30,542 --> 00:19:32,577
Her belief that you wanted
to be fired

430
00:19:32,661 --> 00:19:35,079
led you to wanting
to be fired.

431
00:19:35,163 --> 00:19:37,999
Do we have
a deal or not?

432
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:42,386
It appears we do.

433
00:19:49,428 --> 00:19:52,179
Oh, hey.
Uh, go ahead.

434
00:19:52,231 --> 00:19:54,348
No, that's all right.
You were here first.

435
00:19:54,399 --> 00:19:55,716
Why are you being
so polite?

436
00:19:55,767 --> 00:19:56,984
Come on, you have
one stupid copy.

437
00:19:57,052 --> 00:19:58,436
You could've finished it
already.

438
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:00,938
Louis, I--

439
00:20:01,023 --> 00:20:04,075
A letter of resignation?

440
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:05,109
Why?

441
00:20:05,193 --> 00:20:07,111
It's complicated.

442
00:20:07,195 --> 00:20:10,665
Well, simplify it for me,
Mike.

443
00:20:12,668 --> 00:20:14,201
Harvey.

444
00:20:14,253 --> 00:20:15,536
He's the one
who hired me.

445
00:20:15,587 --> 00:20:17,071
Now he wants nothing
to do with me.

446
00:20:17,122 --> 00:20:18,405
What are you talking about?
He just gave you a new office.

447
00:20:18,457 --> 00:20:20,041
No, Jessica gave me
a new office.

448
00:20:20,092 --> 00:20:24,912
If it was up to Harvey,
I wouldn't even have a cubicle.

449
00:20:24,963 --> 00:20:27,715
What happened?

450
00:20:27,766 --> 00:20:31,085
All that matters is that,
uh, I can't fix it.

451
00:20:33,689 --> 00:20:34,939
You know, when we were
in the bullpen,

452
00:20:35,023 --> 00:20:37,942
Harvey was like Superman.

453
00:20:38,026 --> 00:20:39,894
And then, one day,

454
00:20:39,945 --> 00:20:41,896
Hardman decided to just
knock him down a peg.

455
00:20:41,947 --> 00:20:43,531
Gave him
this bullshit assignment,

456
00:20:43,598 --> 00:20:45,399
undoable workload,
unwinnable case.

457
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:47,034
And I took it
as a chance

458
00:20:47,102 --> 00:20:49,453
to break down his walls
and offer my help.

459
00:20:49,538 --> 00:20:50,738
And I just thought,
this just might be

460
00:20:50,789 --> 00:20:52,106
the chance
that we could become--

461
00:20:52,157 --> 00:20:54,792
- Friends.
- Yeah.

462
00:20:54,876 --> 00:20:58,329
And he looked at me--
how dare I?

463
00:20:58,413 --> 00:20:59,830
I get it.
He's alone.

464
00:20:59,915 --> 00:21:01,465
He always has been.
He always will be.

465
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:03,501
Always was.

466
00:21:03,585 --> 00:21:06,220
Harvey is
not Superman anymore.

467
00:21:07,806 --> 00:21:11,425
He's Batman.

468
00:21:11,476 --> 00:21:13,311
And Batman needs Robin.

469
00:21:13,395 --> 00:21:15,629
And I just need
to remind him of that.

470
00:21:15,681 --> 00:21:17,264
What's the one thing
that Harvey values

471
00:21:17,316 --> 00:21:18,432
over everything else?

472
00:21:18,483 --> 00:21:19,567
- Winning.
- Yeah.

473
00:21:19,634 --> 00:21:20,768
You help him win,

474
00:21:20,819 --> 00:21:22,803
he'll remember
why he needs you.

475
00:21:22,854 --> 00:21:24,905
I have to figure out
what cases he's working on.

476
00:21:24,973 --> 00:21:26,407
The I.T. Department
has access to every computer

477
00:21:26,474 --> 00:21:28,743
in the entire firm,
syncs up every night.

478
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:31,245
So all I have to do is get
access to Harvey's hard drive.

479
00:21:31,312 --> 00:21:33,313
That place is a fortress.

480
00:21:35,867 --> 00:21:37,535
Benjamin.

481
00:21:39,254 --> 00:21:40,705
It's you.

482
00:21:40,789 --> 00:21:42,423
Aw, that's sweet.
You remember me.

483
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:43,657
Oh, yes.

484
00:21:43,709 --> 00:21:45,659
I remember everyone
who's ever bamboozled me

485
00:21:45,711 --> 00:21:47,494
into giving them
a top-of-the-line laptop.

486
00:21:47,546 --> 00:21:48,996
Their names
are Michael Ross.

487
00:21:49,047 --> 00:21:51,015
I didn't bamboozle you,
Benjamin.

488
00:21:51,099 --> 00:21:52,499
I won it
fair and square.

489
00:21:52,551 --> 00:21:55,019
And I've been tracking
every Internet move you've made

490
00:21:55,103 --> 00:21:58,022
for the past ten months,
waiting for the slipup.

491
00:21:58,106 --> 00:22:00,608
Bet you thought you had me
at teenybikini.com.

492
00:22:00,675 --> 00:22:02,560
No.
No, no.

493
00:22:02,644 --> 00:22:04,061
Because I cross-referenced that

494
00:22:04,146 --> 00:22:06,847
with your workplace
harassment case, and I knew.

495
00:22:06,898 --> 00:22:08,816
But don't think I'm not aware
that you went home for dinner

496
00:22:08,867 --> 00:22:11,318
and used your personal computer
to go back there.

497
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:13,287
Okay,
that's not actionable,

498
00:22:13,354 --> 00:22:15,373
but hacking
my personal computer is.

499
00:22:15,457 --> 00:22:18,209
Good luck proving that.
Now, what do you want?

500
00:22:18,293 --> 00:22:20,194
- I want access to a hard drive.
- No way.

501
00:22:20,245 --> 00:22:21,545
Not only that,
I want you to give me

502
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:23,381
whatever I want
whenever I want it

503
00:22:23,465 --> 00:22:24,548
for the rest
of your life.

504
00:22:24,633 --> 00:22:25,916
And why would I
do that?

505
00:22:26,001 --> 00:22:27,385
Oh, right.

506
00:22:27,469 --> 00:22:30,871
Because I just recorded you
admitting to violating the law.

507
00:22:30,922 --> 00:22:33,974
- The XJS-5000.
- Mm-hmm.

508
00:22:34,042 --> 00:22:35,593
- You--you set me up.
- Yep.

509
00:22:35,677 --> 00:22:37,645
You knew that I would
track your home computer.

510
00:22:37,712 --> 00:22:39,146
And after
you've been convicted,

511
00:22:39,214 --> 00:22:42,650
you'll be lucky to be hired
as a network administrator...

512
00:22:42,717 --> 00:22:44,902
At a high school...

513
00:22:44,986 --> 00:22:46,854
In Jersey.

514
00:22:46,905 --> 00:22:48,939
How long are you gonna
keep at this?

515
00:22:49,024 --> 00:22:50,991
Until I find out
what I just got myself into.

516
00:22:51,059 --> 00:22:52,610
I mean, look at this stack
of papers.

517
00:22:52,694 --> 00:22:55,613
It's 1/5 of the files
we have on Ava Hessington.

518
00:22:55,697 --> 00:22:58,249
- You need a shortcut.
- Well, I'm not going to Mike.

519
00:22:58,333 --> 00:23:00,701
I'm not talking
about him.

520
00:23:00,752 --> 00:23:03,587
Ava Hessington
started in the London office.

521
00:23:05,207 --> 00:23:07,174
It's too late.

522
00:23:07,242 --> 00:23:09,927
No, it's not.

523
00:23:13,715 --> 00:23:15,132
You gotta be
kidding me.

524
00:23:15,217 --> 00:23:17,184
How did you get
through security?

525
00:23:17,252 --> 00:23:19,303
Charm and this smile.

526
00:23:19,387 --> 00:23:20,554
You bought a ticket,
didn't you?

527
00:23:20,605 --> 00:23:22,389
Trinidad-Tobago.

528
00:23:22,441 --> 00:23:24,758
First-class?
You're not even going.

529
00:23:24,810 --> 00:23:27,528
I prefer to not travel
in style.

530
00:23:27,595 --> 00:23:29,063
I'd prefer to be alone
right now.

531
00:23:29,114 --> 00:23:31,532
Scottie,
I need your help.

532
00:23:31,599 --> 00:23:33,033
I'm sorry,
I have a plane to catch.

533
00:23:33,101 --> 00:23:34,535
A plane, by the way,
that you put me on.

534
00:23:34,602 --> 00:23:36,954
After I saved your job,
which you accepted.

535
00:23:37,038 --> 00:23:38,605
So now we're both working
for the same firm.

536
00:23:38,657 --> 00:23:40,440
Oh, I guess now I'm just
one of the many partners

537
00:23:40,492 --> 00:23:41,625
who gets to work with you

538
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:43,878
and yet wants nothing to do
with you.

539
00:23:43,945 --> 00:23:45,830
Scottie.

540
00:23:45,914 --> 00:23:48,615
Please!

541
00:23:48,667 --> 00:23:50,417
You once helped me
without me asking.

542
00:23:50,469 --> 00:23:53,337
Well, now I'm asking.

543
00:23:53,421 --> 00:23:55,556
Then tell me something.

544
00:23:55,623 --> 00:23:57,475
Something what?

545
00:23:57,559 --> 00:23:59,510
Just...

546
00:24:01,596 --> 00:24:04,265
Something.

547
00:24:04,316 --> 00:24:06,734
I remember the first time
I ever saw you.

548
00:24:06,801 --> 00:24:08,602
Con Law.

549
00:24:08,653 --> 00:24:10,938
You threw me some line, and I
gave you shit about your hair.

550
00:24:10,989 --> 00:24:12,823
No, it was two weeks
before that

551
00:24:12,908 --> 00:24:14,408
outside Langdell.

552
00:24:14,475 --> 00:24:16,643
You were wearing a blue dress.
The wind was blowing.

553
00:24:16,695 --> 00:24:19,413
When I saw your face,
it stopped me dead in my tracks.

554
00:24:21,166 --> 00:24:22,199
That's not enough.

555
00:24:22,284 --> 00:24:23,918
Well, I'm not finished.

556
00:24:23,985 --> 00:24:26,003
The next time I saw you
was Con Law.

557
00:24:26,087 --> 00:24:28,422
You answered the first question
that Dyson asked,

558
00:24:28,489 --> 00:24:31,542
and I knew that that face
that blew me away

559
00:24:31,626 --> 00:24:34,044
was your second best asset.

560
00:24:34,129 --> 00:24:36,347
Look, you mean
something to me.

561
00:24:36,431 --> 00:24:38,265
You've always meant
something to me,

562
00:24:38,333 --> 00:24:43,187
and you always will mean
something to me.

563
00:24:46,608 --> 00:24:49,527
You are such a dick.

564
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:53,147
What do you need, Harvey?

565
00:24:53,198 --> 00:24:54,815
Ava Hessington.

566
00:24:58,370 --> 00:25:00,187
Well, this is gonna
take a while.

567
00:25:00,238 --> 00:25:04,158
So you're gonna
buy me a drink,

568
00:25:04,209 --> 00:25:07,878
and I'm gonna take that ticket
to Trinidad-Tobago.

569
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:15,780
Okay, Norma,
it's been 24 hours.

570
00:25:15,803 --> 00:25:17,787
If you can't get me Barbara lL.
Tottingham on the phone,

571
00:25:17,838 --> 00:25:19,172
well, then guess what,
you don't get--

572
00:25:19,256 --> 00:25:22,258
Oh.
It's you!

573
00:25:22,309 --> 00:25:23,760
Well, you tell Norma if I don't
have a package of uni-balls

574
00:25:23,811 --> 00:25:25,094
on my desk by noon,

575
00:25:25,145 --> 00:25:26,963
she can kiss her trip
to Dollywood good-bye.

576
00:25:27,014 --> 00:25:28,314
Now, why don't you
get the hell out of here,

577
00:25:28,399 --> 00:25:31,434
so I can fix myself
a raspberry Bran bar in peace?

578
00:25:31,485 --> 00:25:34,404
What are you looking at?

579
00:25:42,312 --> 00:25:43,863
Looking for this?

580
00:25:43,948 --> 00:25:46,199
It's the last one.

581
00:25:46,283 --> 00:25:48,651
Not today.

582
00:25:48,719 --> 00:25:50,653
You're Barbara L. Tottingham.

583
00:25:50,704 --> 00:25:53,039
I hardly made it difficult
to figure out.

584
00:25:53,123 --> 00:25:55,324
Barbara L. Tottingham.

585
00:25:55,376 --> 00:25:59,328
B.L.T.
Which is a sandwich.

586
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:01,214
And what does one put
on a B.L.T.?

587
00:26:01,298 --> 00:26:02,715
Mayonnaise,
invented by the French.

588
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,968
Which points directly
to another French sandwich.

589
00:26:05,019 --> 00:26:06,469
Of course, the monte cristo,
as in the Count of Monte Cristo.

590
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:07,687
How did I not see that?

591
00:26:07,771 --> 00:26:08,771
It was staring me
right in the face.

592
00:26:08,839 --> 00:26:09,839
Indeed it was.

593
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:10,974
The count returned
from the dead,

594
00:26:11,025 --> 00:26:12,392
as I am now returned

595
00:26:12,476 --> 00:26:14,477
from the banishment
to which you sentenced me...

596
00:26:14,528 --> 00:26:15,979
As quartermaster.

597
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:17,613
I would ask you
how you did it,

598
00:26:17,681 --> 00:26:20,016
but I know you wouldn't tell me,
because I wouldn't tell you.

599
00:26:20,067 --> 00:26:21,200
What I will tell you is

600
00:26:21,285 --> 00:26:22,368
that during my time
in the wilderness--

601
00:26:22,453 --> 00:26:24,821
- It was three days.
- And nights.

602
00:26:24,872 --> 00:26:26,039
I endeavored to discover

603
00:26:26,123 --> 00:26:28,374
what perquisites
you value most in this firm--

604
00:26:28,459 --> 00:26:30,793
your beloved Bran bars.

605
00:26:30,861 --> 00:26:31,961
You're never going
to have them.

606
00:26:32,029 --> 00:26:33,379
I can buy them myself.

607
00:26:33,464 --> 00:26:35,305
Even if you were willing
to buy them yourself--

608
00:26:35,365 --> 00:26:37,133
which we both know
you aren't--

609
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,385
you'll never eat them
on Pearson Darby grounds.

610
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:40,386
You didn't.

611
00:26:40,471 --> 00:26:43,089
I did.
They're banned.

612
00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:47,844
Wait a second.

613
00:26:47,895 --> 00:26:51,147
You're telling me that
Barbara L. Tottingham is Nigel?

614
00:26:51,214 --> 00:26:52,515
No.
Stay with me.

615
00:26:52,566 --> 00:26:55,985
B.L.T., mayonnaise,
monte cristo sandwich.

616
00:26:56,053 --> 00:26:57,270
Oh, my God,
I'm so hungry.

617
00:26:57,354 --> 00:26:58,571
- Donna.
- What?

618
00:26:58,655 --> 00:27:00,523
What do you want from me, Louis?
I'm busy.

619
00:27:00,574 --> 00:27:03,059
So you can't have your pens
or your Bran bars, big deal.

620
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:04,444
Donna, listen.

621
00:27:04,528 --> 00:27:05,828
When I was in ninth grade,

622
00:27:05,896 --> 00:27:07,416
there was this wrestler
Randy Cusumano.

623
00:27:07,498 --> 00:27:09,248
And one day after school
in the locker room,

624
00:27:09,333 --> 00:27:11,084
he pinned me down, and he taped
my butt cheeks together.

625
00:27:11,168 --> 00:27:12,869
Wait a second, is this the
story from <i>The Breakfast Club?</i>

626
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,420
I'm not familiar
with that song.

627
00:27:14,505 --> 00:27:17,123
Never mind.

628
00:27:17,207 --> 00:27:18,458
Look, I swore
that I would get him back

629
00:27:18,542 --> 00:27:20,910
no matter what it took.

630
00:27:20,961 --> 00:27:23,012
What did it take?

631
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,213
Ah, you don't really
wanna know.

632
00:27:24,264 --> 00:27:25,548
Thank you.

633
00:27:25,599 --> 00:27:27,083
The point is
if I'm Nigel and Nigel's me,

634
00:27:27,134 --> 00:27:29,802
he's not gonna stop
at Bran bars and pens.

635
00:27:29,887 --> 00:27:32,472
I gotta take care of Nigel
once and for all.

636
00:27:34,224 --> 00:27:36,726
You need to get rid of him
as quartermaster.

637
00:27:36,777 --> 00:27:37,977
Miss Hessington,

638
00:27:38,062 --> 00:27:40,063
first of all, I want you
to familiarize yourself

639
00:27:40,114 --> 00:27:41,230
with this man.

640
00:27:41,281 --> 00:27:42,899
U.S. attorney
Richard Jensen.

641
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:44,567
He's one of the best
there is,

642
00:27:44,618 --> 00:27:45,902
and he's
who we'll be going up against.

643
00:27:45,953 --> 00:27:47,370
Well, that's all
well and good, Mr. Specter,

644
00:27:47,437 --> 00:27:48,988
but I have one question.

645
00:27:49,073 --> 00:27:51,157
Why should I hire you?

646
00:27:51,241 --> 00:27:52,575
Because you trust
Edward Darby.

647
00:27:52,626 --> 00:27:54,744
I'm afraid that only gets you
in the room.

648
00:27:54,795 --> 00:27:56,779
This civil servant

649
00:27:56,830 --> 00:27:58,464
seems to have
a personal vendetta against me,

650
00:27:58,549 --> 00:27:59,832
and I don't even know why.

651
00:27:59,917 --> 00:28:00,950
Well, I do.

652
00:28:01,001 --> 00:28:02,284
He needs a head
on a platter.

653
00:28:02,336 --> 00:28:03,669
Why mine?

654
00:28:03,754 --> 00:28:05,888
You've been skirting
environmental laws for a decade.

655
00:28:05,956 --> 00:28:07,974
He's got a chance to nail you,
and he's gonna take it.

656
00:28:08,058 --> 00:28:10,459
This isn't
an environmental allegation.

657
00:28:10,511 --> 00:28:12,628
No, it's a bribery charge,

658
00:28:12,679 --> 00:28:14,847
it's got teeth,
and it's coming your way.

659
00:28:14,932 --> 00:28:17,817
Don't sugarcoat it,
Mr. Specter.

660
00:28:17,901 --> 00:28:19,735
Give it to me straight.
Okay, I will.

661
00:28:19,803 --> 00:28:21,821
Because when he digs
a little deeper,

662
00:28:21,905 --> 00:28:23,139
he's gonna find evidence

663
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:25,908
of the spill your company
covered up in 2008,

664
00:28:25,976 --> 00:28:28,244
the whistle-blower
you bought off in 2010,

665
00:28:28,311 --> 00:28:32,081
and the environmental impact
study you doctored in 2006.

666
00:28:32,149 --> 00:28:34,200
So it's not gonna be hard
to convince a jury

667
00:28:34,284 --> 00:28:36,619
that you're guilty of bribing
a foreign government

668
00:28:36,670 --> 00:28:38,421
to get your pipeline.

669
00:28:38,488 --> 00:28:40,923
And what are you going to do
to stop him?

670
00:28:40,991 --> 00:28:44,827
Bury evidence,
contact witnesses,

671
00:28:44,878 --> 00:28:47,346
or sleep with your rival
pitcher's girlfriend

672
00:28:47,431 --> 00:28:49,549
the night
before the big game?

673
00:28:49,633 --> 00:28:51,267
The heart wants
what the heart wants.

674
00:28:51,334 --> 00:28:52,602
I got it.

675
00:28:52,669 --> 00:28:55,221
I looked into you.
You looked into me.

676
00:28:55,305 --> 00:28:56,772
I actually prefer it
that way.

677
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,174
And why is that?

678
00:28:58,225 --> 00:28:59,475
Because you know
what I'll do to win.

679
00:28:59,526 --> 00:29:01,286
Saves me the trouble
of explaining it to you.

680
00:29:01,344 --> 00:29:03,062
And I won't have
to explain to you

681
00:29:03,147 --> 00:29:04,680
what I did to win
that pipeline.

682
00:29:04,731 --> 00:29:05,982
You bribed them.

683
00:29:06,033 --> 00:29:07,817
Guilty as charged.

684
00:29:07,868 --> 00:29:09,368
And I don't care
what Richard Jensen says.

685
00:29:09,453 --> 00:29:11,154
Every company with a pipeline
over there

686
00:29:11,205 --> 00:29:12,788
did the same thing.

687
00:29:12,856 --> 00:29:14,857
- Is that your defense?
- It's the truth.

688
00:29:14,908 --> 00:29:16,542
It would be nice
if we only found oil

689
00:29:16,627 --> 00:29:19,495
under Texas ranchers
or North Sea fishermen.

690
00:29:19,546 --> 00:29:20,913
But in the real world,

691
00:29:20,998 --> 00:29:24,500
we find it in nasty places
under nasty people.

692
00:29:24,551 --> 00:29:26,586
And any executive worth a damn
does what's needed

693
00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:28,004
or goes out of business.

694
00:29:28,055 --> 00:29:31,390
- Good. We're done.
- Excuse me?

695
00:29:31,475 --> 00:29:33,235
I just needed to know
what I was dealing with

696
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:34,677
before I make
my next move.

697
00:29:34,728 --> 00:29:36,679
- And what is that?
- I'll let you know.

698
00:29:36,730 --> 00:29:39,265
I haven't officially
hired you yet.

699
00:29:39,349 --> 00:29:41,517
Yes, you have.

700
00:29:48,892 --> 00:29:50,743
How long
you been waiting here?

701
00:29:50,827 --> 00:29:52,612
Since I found out
what you need.

702
00:29:52,696 --> 00:29:54,497
What I need is for you
to leave me alone.

703
00:29:54,564 --> 00:29:57,283
No, what you need is
information on Ava Hessington.

704
00:29:57,367 --> 00:29:59,919
In 2008, her company tried
to destroy evidence--

705
00:30:00,003 --> 00:30:02,238
Of an oil spill?

706
00:30:02,289 --> 00:30:04,207
Okay, well,
in 2010, they--

707
00:30:04,258 --> 00:30:05,841
They bought off
a whistle-blower.

708
00:30:05,909 --> 00:30:07,460
And if the next thing
you're gonna tell me

709
00:30:07,544 --> 00:30:10,513
is about an environmental
impact study in 2006,

710
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:11,547
don't.

711
00:30:11,598 --> 00:30:13,249
You think
you're not replaceable?

712
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:15,017
I got all that
from an associate

713
00:30:15,085 --> 00:30:16,552
I picked at random.

714
00:30:16,603 --> 00:30:18,471
I've been doing this
before I met you,

715
00:30:18,555 --> 00:30:21,257
and I'll be doing it long after
I've forgotten all about you.

716
00:30:21,308 --> 00:30:22,692
You had enough?
No.

717
00:30:22,759 --> 00:30:25,027
No, you know what, I haven't,
because you haven't.

718
00:30:25,095 --> 00:30:26,445
Excuse me?

719
00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:27,780
You haven't said whatever
you have to say to rip me

720
00:30:27,864 --> 00:30:29,031
to shreds enough so that
you can start to forgive me.

721
00:30:29,099 --> 00:30:30,616
So go ahead.

722
00:30:30,701 --> 00:30:31,817
Whatever it takes,
I can take it.

723
00:30:31,902 --> 00:30:33,869
Go!

724
00:30:33,937 --> 00:30:35,538
Harvey, I'm sorry,
all right?

725
00:30:35,605 --> 00:30:36,822
But I need you
to listen to me now.

726
00:30:36,907 --> 00:30:38,624
Listen to you?

727
00:30:38,709 --> 00:30:40,376
You know when I would've
listened to you?

728
00:30:40,443 --> 00:30:41,544
That night.

729
00:30:41,611 --> 00:30:45,281
- Jessica threatened me.
- I don't care.

730
00:30:45,332 --> 00:30:46,549
Anyone comes at you
with any threat at all,

731
00:30:46,616 --> 00:30:47,967
you come to me.

732
00:30:48,051 --> 00:30:49,418
I don't give a shit
if it's the Queen on England.

733
00:30:49,469 --> 00:30:51,470
You come to me.
You tell me!

734
00:30:51,555 --> 00:30:53,172
You tell me everything!

735
00:30:53,257 --> 00:30:55,391
That's what
goddamn loyalty is.

736
00:31:12,025 --> 00:31:13,192
Okay, you're right.

737
00:31:13,277 --> 00:31:14,443
You don't know
who I am

738
00:31:14,494 --> 00:31:15,974
or what I've done
to deserve anything.

739
00:31:15,979 --> 00:31:18,114
So here's what's gonna happen.
I am gonna tell you.

740
00:31:18,165 --> 00:31:19,699
I am gonna tell you
everything,

741
00:31:19,783 --> 00:31:21,250
and when we're done,
either we're gonna be finished,

742
00:31:21,318 --> 00:31:23,252
or we're gonna go back there
and we're gonna do exactly

743
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:25,588
what we should've done
the other night.

744
00:31:25,655 --> 00:31:27,707
Okay.

745
00:31:32,118 --> 00:31:33,570
Okay, one more time.

746
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:35,420
Are you ready?
Yes.

747
00:31:35,471 --> 00:31:36,421
- You sure?
- Mm-hmm.

748
00:31:36,472 --> 00:31:37,422
Okay.

749
00:31:37,473 --> 00:31:39,224
So I was here.
Mmhmm.

750
00:31:39,275 --> 00:31:41,143
Yeah? And I was running
down here.

751
00:31:41,227 --> 00:31:43,445
And the cops,
they were back here.

752
00:31:43,529 --> 00:31:46,315
So I am running--
let's see, where is it?

753
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:47,900
Oh, yeah,
it was down here.

754
00:31:47,951 --> 00:31:49,868
And I run into here,

755
00:31:49,936 --> 00:31:51,954
and then Donna,
she was right here.

756
00:31:52,038 --> 00:31:54,823
- Okay.
- So she let me in...

757
00:31:54,908 --> 00:31:56,792
Here.

758
00:31:56,876 --> 00:31:59,544
And then Harvey,
he was right down--

759
00:31:59,612 --> 00:32:00,579
No!

760
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:01,780
What?

761
00:32:01,831 --> 00:32:04,115
Harvey is not getting
anywhere near there.

762
00:32:04,167 --> 00:32:06,051
Oh, no one is ever
getting anywhere near there.

763
00:32:06,118 --> 00:32:07,386
Oh, you think
you're that good, do you?

764
00:32:07,453 --> 00:32:09,755
It's one
of my many gifts.

765
00:32:09,806 --> 00:32:11,566
Being that good
or thinking you're that good?

766
00:32:11,591 --> 00:32:14,259
Do you want a replay?
'Cause I will go right now.

767
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:16,728
- Like you could.
- I could!

768
00:32:16,796 --> 00:32:19,014
Soon...ish.

769
00:32:19,098 --> 00:32:20,799
Do you have, like,
an energy drink or something?

770
00:32:20,850 --> 00:32:22,901
- Oh.
- Come on! We were up all night.

771
00:32:22,969 --> 00:32:24,302
You kept me up
all night.

772
00:32:24,354 --> 00:32:27,305
<i>You</i> kept me up all night.

773
00:32:36,649 --> 00:32:39,668
I can't tell you
how it feels

774
00:32:39,752 --> 00:32:41,486
that you know.

775
00:32:41,537 --> 00:32:43,488
Mm, well, who knew

776
00:32:43,539 --> 00:32:46,258
that honesty
was the best policy?

777
00:32:46,325 --> 00:32:49,378
Oh, wait.
Everyone knew that.

778
00:32:51,881 --> 00:32:54,349
What?

779
00:33:01,691 --> 00:33:03,976
Can I help you?

780
00:33:06,279 --> 00:33:07,195
Louis Litt.

781
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:08,814
Oh, I know
who you are.

782
00:33:08,865 --> 00:33:11,233
Freshly minted
senior partner,

783
00:33:11,317 --> 00:33:13,535
expert in matters
of corporate finance,

784
00:33:13,619 --> 00:33:16,021
and the man responsible
for the superb training

785
00:33:16,072 --> 00:33:17,155
of the associates.

786
00:33:18,992 --> 00:33:21,076
You've looked into me.
Mmhmm.

787
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:24,079
I've looked into you.

788
00:33:24,163 --> 00:33:25,998
Tarte au chocolat
from Cafe Pouchkine.

789
00:33:26,049 --> 00:33:28,366
The best patisserie
in Paris.

790
00:33:28,418 --> 00:33:30,085
A steeping cup
of da Hong pao.

791
00:33:30,169 --> 00:33:32,170
The most expensive tea
in the world.

792
00:33:32,221 --> 00:33:34,172
Two of my favorite things.

793
00:33:34,223 --> 00:33:37,843
What better to enjoy
after signing this order...

794
00:33:37,894 --> 00:33:39,144
Making me quartermaster?

795
00:33:39,211 --> 00:33:40,512
Pity you don't have
a Montblanc pen

796
00:33:40,563 --> 00:33:41,763
for me to sign it with.

797
00:33:41,848 --> 00:33:44,566
With cobalt ink.

798
00:33:44,650 --> 00:33:46,184
We already have
a quartermaster.

799
00:33:46,235 --> 00:33:47,652
Sir, I know...

800
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,771
That this is
Nigel's position

801
00:33:49,856 --> 00:33:52,107
and him losing it
would not be easy for him.

802
00:33:52,191 --> 00:33:53,909
But let me
just assure you,

803
00:33:53,993 --> 00:33:56,912
I'm not just prepared
for this position...

804
00:33:56,996 --> 00:33:59,364
I was born for it.

805
00:33:59,415 --> 00:34:02,367
I have PhDs
in chemical engineering

806
00:34:02,418 --> 00:34:03,919
and petroleum exploration.

807
00:34:04,003 --> 00:34:06,588
I've made it to the top
in a field dominated by men,

808
00:34:06,672 --> 00:34:09,041
and I'm facing
a prison sentence

809
00:34:09,092 --> 00:34:11,209
for an allegation
which any man in my position

810
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:12,577
would be fined for.

811
00:34:12,628 --> 00:34:14,713
Every similar case
has been settled with a fine,

812
00:34:14,764 --> 00:34:15,931
not prison.

813
00:34:16,015 --> 00:34:17,136
That's what we're proposing.

814
00:34:17,183 --> 00:34:19,217
Well, there's just
one problem.

815
00:34:19,268 --> 00:34:21,686
I'm not charging you
because you're a woman.

816
00:34:21,754 --> 00:34:23,271
I'm charging you
because you're the one I caught.

817
00:34:23,356 --> 00:34:25,807
Ava, can you give us
a minute?

818
00:34:34,283 --> 00:34:36,735
Okay, she's gonna
write you a check.

819
00:34:36,786 --> 00:34:38,070
Let's talk about how much.

820
00:34:38,121 --> 00:34:40,288
I'm sorry, Harvey.

821
00:34:40,373 --> 00:34:42,324
Not this time.

822
00:34:44,744 --> 00:34:45,944
Is that what I said to you
on Hazelton?

823
00:34:45,995 --> 00:34:47,662
That was
a long time ago.

824
00:34:47,747 --> 00:34:49,915
We're not at the D.A.'s office
anymore.

825
00:34:49,966 --> 00:34:52,784
I didn't realize our bond
had an expiration date.

826
00:34:52,835 --> 00:34:54,619
It doesn't, but...

827
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:57,889
you want to deal on this,
I need jail time.

828
00:34:59,842 --> 00:35:01,093
You're running for office?

829
00:35:01,144 --> 00:35:02,561
What if I am?

830
00:35:02,628 --> 00:35:05,230
You need a scalp.

831
00:35:05,297 --> 00:35:06,731
I can think of four people
off the top of my head

832
00:35:06,799 --> 00:35:08,279
that make her look like
Mother Teresa.

833
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:10,519
Harvey, I can't afford
to horse trade on this.

834
00:35:10,603 --> 00:35:11,603
You've done it before.

835
00:35:11,654 --> 00:35:13,605
And I'll do it again,
but...not today.

836
00:35:13,656 --> 00:35:16,358
Richard, you are singling out
this woman, and it's wrong.

837
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:18,944
That's not my problem.

838
00:35:18,995 --> 00:35:20,362
What if I told you
I need this one?

839
00:35:20,446 --> 00:35:24,082
Then I'd have to tell you...
I'm sorry.

840
00:35:25,668 --> 00:35:27,202
Not gonna forget this.

841
00:35:27,286 --> 00:35:28,620
Harvey, look.

842
00:35:28,671 --> 00:35:31,256
If our bond can't survive
me telling you no,

843
00:35:31,323 --> 00:35:32,991
then...

844
00:35:33,042 --> 00:35:35,961
It didn't mean much
to begin with.

845
00:35:44,003 --> 00:35:47,305
- Hey, Rach.
- No time, code two!

846
00:35:47,356 --> 00:35:48,690
Richard Gere's
in the lobby?

847
00:35:48,774 --> 00:35:51,193
- Leaving now, let's go.
- Relax.

848
00:35:51,277 --> 00:35:54,196
We have trained for this.
Okay.

849
00:35:55,731 --> 00:35:57,682
Wait!

850
00:36:11,664 --> 00:36:13,865
Congratulations.

851
00:36:13,916 --> 00:36:17,368
Your writing implements
and nourishment of choice.

852
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:18,553
Mm.

853
00:36:18,638 --> 00:36:22,557
Yeah, I'd say I'm sorry,
but I'm not.

854
00:36:22,642 --> 00:36:24,809
Please don't do this.

855
00:36:24,877 --> 00:36:26,895
No, no, no,
no, no, no.

856
00:36:26,979 --> 00:36:29,397
You're not gonna trick me into
letting you stay quartermaster

857
00:36:29,482 --> 00:36:30,932
just so you can take away
what's most dear to me

858
00:36:31,017 --> 00:36:33,401
little by little.

859
00:36:33,486 --> 00:36:37,105
Then I'm afraid I'm gonna have
to take it away all at once.

860
00:36:38,574 --> 00:36:39,991
What are you
talking about?

861
00:36:40,059 --> 00:36:42,861
I took you for a bylaws man.
It seems I was wrong.

862
00:36:42,912 --> 00:36:44,395
At Darby International,

863
00:36:44,447 --> 00:36:45,947
one cannot be in charge
of both the animate

864
00:36:46,032 --> 00:36:48,533
and the inanimate
at the same time.

865
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:53,955
Your beloved associates
are mine.

866
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:55,290
You set me up.

867
00:36:55,374 --> 00:36:56,708
What better way
to catch a rat

868
00:36:56,759 --> 00:36:58,460
than with
quartermaster cheese?

869
00:36:58,544 --> 00:36:59,761
What are you gonna do,

870
00:36:59,845 --> 00:37:02,881
beg Darby to undo
what you just begged him to do?

871
00:37:05,101 --> 00:37:07,686
Hold on.

872
00:37:07,753 --> 00:37:11,056
Nigel, the associates
are my life.

873
00:37:13,109 --> 00:37:14,425
So please don't do this.

874
00:37:14,477 --> 00:37:16,478
When I was
at preparatory school,

875
00:37:16,562 --> 00:37:19,231
like you,
I was bullied again and again.

876
00:37:19,282 --> 00:37:22,067
It was painful,
but I always saw them coming.

877
00:37:22,118 --> 00:37:23,601
But with you,
I didn't.

878
00:37:23,653 --> 00:37:26,988
So it wasn't a stab in the back,
it was a stab in the heart.

879
00:37:27,073 --> 00:37:29,741
And I just gave you
the opportunity to take it back,

880
00:37:29,792 --> 00:37:31,376
and you passed.

881
00:37:31,443 --> 00:37:35,664
So no, quartermaster Litt,
I won't forgive you.

882
00:37:41,304 --> 00:37:42,954
Nice office.

883
00:37:43,005 --> 00:37:44,723
Thanks.

884
00:37:44,790 --> 00:37:47,008
Do you mind
if I ask you a favor?

885
00:37:47,093 --> 00:37:48,176
Yeah, anything.

886
00:37:48,261 --> 00:37:49,978
I have
a ton of old files

887
00:37:50,062 --> 00:37:51,930
that I need organized
and shipped to storage,

888
00:37:51,981 --> 00:37:55,133
and I was wondering if you
could maybe do that for me.

889
00:37:55,184 --> 00:37:56,634
I

890
00:37:56,686 --> 00:37:58,153
Because I figured if you were
suddenly doing things for people

891
00:37:58,237 --> 00:38:00,105
that they don't need you to do,
didn't ask you to do,

892
00:38:00,156 --> 00:38:03,775
and don't want you to do,
then maybe I'd get in on that.

893
00:38:06,579 --> 00:38:09,748
I put that on Harvey's desk
for him, not you.

894
00:38:09,815 --> 00:38:12,033
Maybe.

895
00:38:12,118 --> 00:38:13,818
But I know
what you don't seem to get.

896
00:38:13,869 --> 00:38:16,654
Harvey didn't value you
for your help on cases.

897
00:38:16,706 --> 00:38:19,157
He valued you for your loyalty,
which he told you last night.

898
00:38:19,208 --> 00:38:20,375
Yeah, I know that.

899
00:38:20,459 --> 00:38:21,619
And I'm trying
to get it back,

900
00:38:21,627 --> 00:38:22,827
and this is
the only way I know how.

901
00:38:22,878 --> 00:38:24,162
By sending Rachel
to distract me

902
00:38:24,213 --> 00:38:25,630
and sneaking
into his office?

903
00:38:25,681 --> 00:38:27,299
Oh, by the way, you think
I don't know about you two?

904
00:38:27,350 --> 00:38:29,000
Took me one look.
Donna, come on.

905
00:38:29,051 --> 00:38:32,020
You wanna know how
to get Harvey's loyalty back?

906
00:38:32,104 --> 00:38:34,522
Get in a time machine and undo
what you did with Jessica.

907
00:38:34,607 --> 00:38:36,507
Oh, shoot,
you can't do that.

908
00:38:36,559 --> 00:38:39,110
You know what, I figured
you'd bring this file back.

909
00:38:39,178 --> 00:38:41,146
There's also one
in your bottom drawer.

910
00:38:41,197 --> 00:38:44,816
You might wanna grab that too.

911
00:38:44,867 --> 00:38:45,984
And just in case of that,

912
00:38:46,035 --> 00:38:48,737
I put seven other copies
in his office.

913
00:38:48,821 --> 00:38:50,288
'Cause whether
he forgives me or not,

914
00:38:50,356 --> 00:38:52,824
he's still gonna need it.

915
00:38:52,875 --> 00:38:55,160
Some random associate
gave him all that information

916
00:38:55,211 --> 00:38:57,712
on Ava Hessington?

917
00:38:57,797 --> 00:38:58,747
No way.

918
00:38:58,831 --> 00:39:01,299
It was Scottie.

919
00:39:01,367 --> 00:39:03,534
Yeah, I found the ticket
to Trinidad-Tobago.

920
00:39:03,586 --> 00:39:04,803
It's not a giant leap.

921
00:39:04,870 --> 00:39:07,505
The only problem is
Scottie's not here.

922
00:39:07,556 --> 00:39:08,923
She's in London.

923
00:39:09,008 --> 00:39:11,542
And Harvey--
he is still gonna need this.

924
00:39:11,594 --> 00:39:15,597
This file doesn't lead
to Harvey forgiving you.

925
00:39:15,681 --> 00:39:17,098
Donna...

926
00:39:17,183 --> 00:39:19,067
Please could you just separate
our relationship

927
00:39:19,151 --> 00:39:20,952
from yours and his
for just, like, one second?

928
00:39:20,986 --> 00:39:22,354
Are you kidding me?

929
00:39:22,405 --> 00:39:24,022
Do you think I'm mad
just because of him?

930
00:39:24,073 --> 00:39:25,990
You did this
to me too.

931
00:39:26,058 --> 00:39:27,525
And whether you appreciate it
or not,

932
00:39:27,576 --> 00:39:29,277
I've had your back
since the day that you got here.

933
00:39:29,362 --> 00:39:31,863
Yes. Yes, you have.
But what about last year?

934
00:39:31,914 --> 00:39:33,248
When I had your back,
you ignored me,

935
00:39:33,332 --> 00:39:34,999
and it almost cost him
his license.

936
00:39:35,067 --> 00:39:37,669
The difference is
I did what I did for him,

937
00:39:37,736 --> 00:39:39,254
not for me.

938
00:39:39,338 --> 00:39:41,406
And I didn't get
a brand-new office for it.

939
00:39:41,457 --> 00:39:43,675
I got fired.

940
00:39:53,679 --> 00:39:54,896
Yum.

941
00:39:54,964 --> 00:39:57,099
Oh, what do you want, Michael?
Please.

942
00:39:57,150 --> 00:39:58,633
I'm just trying to eat
my egg McMuffin

943
00:39:58,684 --> 00:39:59,935
while I'm still off-line,
okay?

944
00:39:59,986 --> 00:40:02,654
I thought
you were never off-line.

945
00:40:02,739 --> 00:40:05,690
Five minutes a day.

946
00:40:05,775 --> 00:40:07,192
Listen, Benjamin,

947
00:40:07,276 --> 00:40:09,945
I don't wanna hold what's
on this dictaphone over you

948
00:40:09,996 --> 00:40:11,113
for the rest
of your life.

949
00:40:11,164 --> 00:40:13,532
Why not?

950
00:40:13,616 --> 00:40:15,117
I don't need
any more enemies.

951
00:40:15,168 --> 00:40:17,452
I'd rather have a friend,
but...

952
00:40:17,503 --> 00:40:19,421
I do need a favor.

953
00:40:19,488 --> 00:40:21,123
And if I don't
give it to you,

954
00:40:21,174 --> 00:40:25,127
then what do you do
with the dictaphone?

955
00:40:25,178 --> 00:40:26,762
It's the only copy
there is.

956
00:40:26,829 --> 00:40:27,963
Go on, erase it.

957
00:40:28,014 --> 00:40:30,048
Then I'll ask you
my favor.

958
00:40:30,133 --> 00:40:32,934
How do I know
that this is the only copy?

959
00:40:33,002 --> 00:40:35,387
Because I'm giving you
my word.

960
00:40:40,643 --> 00:40:41,726
What do you need?

961
00:40:41,811 --> 00:40:45,981
I need you to build me
a time machine.

962
00:40:47,116 --> 00:40:49,401
And a bite
of the sandwich.

963
00:40:49,485 --> 00:40:52,020
Come on.
That's not sanitary, Michael.

964
00:40:52,071 --> 00:40:54,873
Come on,
just a little.

965
00:40:54,957 --> 00:40:57,793
You can have
the rest.

966
00:40:59,745 --> 00:41:01,529
- How did it go with Richard?
- It didn't.

967
00:41:01,581 --> 00:41:03,364
He didn't budge.
Why not?

968
00:41:03,416 --> 00:41:05,700
Says he's running for office,
but it doesn't make sense.

969
00:41:05,751 --> 00:41:08,503
Yeah, it does.

970
00:41:10,539 --> 00:41:12,207
Son of bitch!

971
00:41:12,258 --> 00:41:13,374
He looks me in the eye,

972
00:41:13,426 --> 00:41:14,826
and he feeds me
a bullshit sandwich.

973
00:41:14,877 --> 00:41:16,878
He's obviously not
the same man he used to be.

974
00:41:16,929 --> 00:41:19,147
Yeah, well, I am.

975
00:41:19,215 --> 00:41:21,183
Wait a second.
Let me guess. Mike?

976
00:41:21,234 --> 00:41:22,434
Just because you use it

977
00:41:22,518 --> 00:41:23,551
doesn't mean you have
to forgive him.

978
00:41:23,603 --> 00:41:25,553
You're right.
I don't.

979
00:41:33,663 --> 00:41:35,897
Harvey.
What are you doing here?

980
00:41:35,948 --> 00:41:38,233
Hessington Oil's
number one competitor

981
00:41:38,284 --> 00:41:41,169
also happens to be your biggest
campaign contributor?

982
00:41:41,237 --> 00:41:42,454
Which has nothing to do
with the fact

983
00:41:42,538 --> 00:41:43,622
that your client
broke the law.

984
00:41:43,706 --> 00:41:44,906
You don't want a deal.

985
00:41:44,957 --> 00:41:47,008
What you want
is a long, drawn-out trial

986
00:41:47,076 --> 00:41:49,010
that puts our stock
in the toilet.

987
00:41:49,078 --> 00:41:51,213
You think I wasn't
gonna find that out?

988
00:41:51,264 --> 00:41:52,597
I mean,
I gotta hand it to you.

989
00:41:52,682 --> 00:41:53,748
You set it up perfectly

990
00:41:53,799 --> 00:41:55,016
to shield yourself
from prosecution.

991
00:41:55,084 --> 00:41:57,853
To shield myself
from breaking the law.

992
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:00,272
Prosecuting the competition.

993
00:42:00,356 --> 00:42:02,023
It's a hell
of a campaign slogan.

994
00:42:02,091 --> 00:42:04,976
Harvey,
your client did this.

995
00:42:05,061 --> 00:42:06,928
I'm not going
after an innocent person.

996
00:42:06,979 --> 00:42:08,780
And you know
that if I win this election,

997
00:42:08,865 --> 00:42:10,315
I will do good things.

998
00:42:10,399 --> 00:42:12,534
You know what, you sound
just like Cameron Dennis.

999
00:42:12,601 --> 00:42:13,818
You remember?

1000
00:42:13,903 --> 00:42:16,204
Always a reason,
always out for the greater good.

1001
00:42:16,272 --> 00:42:18,490
But in the end,
it's all about him.

1002
00:42:18,574 --> 00:42:20,659
Look, I've never claimed
to be out for the greater good.

1003
00:42:20,743 --> 00:42:23,578
So cut me a deal
and find yourself another donor.

1004
00:42:23,629 --> 00:42:26,748
Harvey, it's too late.

1005
00:42:26,799 --> 00:42:29,384
Please.
I need this.

1006
00:42:30,619 --> 00:42:34,339
Well, that's not
my problem.

1007
00:42:35,457 --> 00:42:38,310
Send Carolyn my love.

1008
00:42:41,814 --> 00:42:43,148
You wanted to see me?

1009
00:42:43,232 --> 00:42:46,017
I know why you care so much
about Ava Hessington.

1010
00:42:46,102 --> 00:42:47,068
Well, it's no secret.

1011
00:42:47,136 --> 00:42:48,737
Her father
was my first client.

1012
00:42:48,804 --> 00:42:53,408
I think he was
a little bit more than that.

1013
00:42:53,475 --> 00:42:54,976
It was a different time.

1014
00:42:55,027 --> 00:42:57,362
Does she know?

1015
00:42:57,446 --> 00:42:59,998
She knows
that I care about her.

1016
00:43:00,082 --> 00:43:01,923
I'm sorry, was there
something else you wanted?

1017
00:43:01,951 --> 00:43:03,168
Just to let you know
that if I could figure that out,

1018
00:43:03,252 --> 00:43:04,869
Harvey can figure that out.

1019
00:43:04,954 --> 00:43:06,621
And why would that
be a problem?

1020
00:43:06,672 --> 00:43:08,123
Because it's one thing
for Harvey to know

1021
00:43:08,174 --> 00:43:09,624
that this case
is important to you,

1022
00:43:09,675 --> 00:43:12,928
another to know
how important.

1023
00:43:12,995 --> 00:43:15,513
Are you telling me
you don't trust him?

1024
00:43:15,598 --> 00:43:16,932
I told you

1025
00:43:16,999 --> 00:43:20,168
he's having a difficult time
digesting this merger.

1026
00:43:20,219 --> 00:43:24,806
I don't want him using this
as leverage to leave.

1027
00:43:24,857 --> 00:43:26,608
At the end of the day,

1028
00:43:26,675 --> 00:43:29,945
I don't believe
Harvey really wants to leave.

1029
00:43:31,447 --> 00:43:32,614
Harvey...

1030
00:43:32,681 --> 00:43:33,898
What a coincidence.

1031
00:43:33,983 --> 00:43:36,851
Cameron.
You grew the mustache back.

1032
00:43:36,902 --> 00:43:38,737
I'll let you in
on a little secret.

1033
00:43:38,821 --> 00:43:41,539
It wasn't a success
the first time.

1034
00:43:41,624 --> 00:43:43,024
What are you doing here?

1035
00:43:43,075 --> 00:43:44,793
Ah, Richard told me
that you mentioned me

1036
00:43:44,860 --> 00:43:46,294
at your last meeting.

1037
00:43:46,362 --> 00:43:49,130
It's funny,
'cause he called me

1038
00:43:49,198 --> 00:43:51,699
after your first meeting,
wanted my advice.

1039
00:43:51,751 --> 00:43:53,501
So I guess
you're here to tell me

1040
00:43:53,552 --> 00:43:55,170
he's not gonna give me
a deal.

1041
00:43:55,221 --> 00:43:57,205
I'm here to tell you he's
recusing himself from the case.

1042
00:43:57,256 --> 00:43:59,174
He didn't want the appearance
of a conflict

1043
00:43:59,225 --> 00:44:01,259
to damage the workings
of justice.

1044
00:44:01,344 --> 00:44:03,211
So he appointed
a special prosecutor.

1045
00:44:03,262 --> 00:44:06,047
Lucky for me,
I've always been special.

1046
00:44:06,098 --> 00:44:07,732
No, you've always been
a corrupt prick.

1047
00:44:07,817 --> 00:44:09,517
It just took me a while
to realize it.

1048
00:44:09,568 --> 00:44:11,052
And it took me a while
to realize

1049
00:44:11,103 --> 00:44:13,355
that you don't have a speck
of loyalty in your entire body.

1050
00:44:13,406 --> 00:44:16,324
Loyalty is a two-way street,
and you ran me off the road.

1051
00:44:16,392 --> 00:44:18,243
So what
are you gonna do?

1052
00:44:18,327 --> 00:44:20,412
You gonna let Jessica fight your
fight like you did last time,

1053
00:44:20,496 --> 00:44:21,729
or you gonna run away

1054
00:44:21,781 --> 00:44:23,031
like you did when you left
the D.A.'s office?

1055
00:44:23,082 --> 00:44:25,033
Neither one, Cameron.
But thank you.

1056
00:44:25,084 --> 00:44:26,701
For what?

1057
00:44:26,752 --> 00:44:29,737
For reminding me
that I don't run from a fight.

1058
00:44:32,741 --> 00:44:33,708
What was so important
that I had

1059
00:44:33,759 --> 00:44:35,627
to come down here
right away?

1060
00:44:35,711 --> 00:44:38,847
Don't tell me
you want a bigger office.

1061
00:44:38,914 --> 00:44:40,682
You told me
that I can think of this office

1062
00:44:40,749 --> 00:44:43,134
as a reminder
of what I did to Harvey

1063
00:44:43,219 --> 00:44:46,638
or as a symbol
of what I can do at this firm.

1064
00:44:46,722 --> 00:44:48,890
But the thing is
I don't wanna be here

1065
00:44:48,941 --> 00:44:50,925
if I'm not solid
with Harvey.

1066
00:44:50,976 --> 00:44:53,428
Well,
that's between you and Harvey.

1067
00:44:53,479 --> 00:44:57,399
It's between you and me.

1068
00:44:57,450 --> 00:45:00,235
You put yourself between us
when you blackmailed me.

1069
00:45:00,286 --> 00:45:02,153
Well, the word
you're looking for is extortion,

1070
00:45:02,238 --> 00:45:03,655
not blackmail,

1071
00:45:03,739 --> 00:45:06,157
and I'm not going to comment
on that accusation.

1072
00:45:06,242 --> 00:45:09,077
But as for your choices,

1073
00:45:09,128 --> 00:45:11,112
you made those
all by yourself.

1074
00:45:11,163 --> 00:45:12,414
So don't come crying
to me.

1075
00:45:14,417 --> 00:45:16,951
This is a copy of the letter you
wrote to the district attorney

1076
00:45:17,002 --> 00:45:19,337
when you threatened
to expose me.

1077
00:45:19,422 --> 00:45:21,423
Expose you?
For what?

1078
00:45:21,474 --> 00:45:22,754
I never wrote
a letter like that.

1079
00:45:22,791 --> 00:45:25,226
I'm not recording you.

1080
00:45:25,294 --> 00:45:26,678
I don't need
to record you.

1081
00:45:26,762 --> 00:45:29,431
This letter was printed
from your hard drive,

1082
00:45:29,482 --> 00:45:32,300
which has your computer's
digital signature.

1083
00:45:35,688 --> 00:45:37,772
What do you want?

1084
00:45:37,823 --> 00:45:39,274
I wanna know,
if you had the chance,

1085
00:45:39,325 --> 00:45:40,641
would you have traded
that car

1086
00:45:40,693 --> 00:45:42,110
to get your parents
back together?

1087
00:45:43,312 --> 00:45:44,746
That's a stupid
goddamn question,

1088
00:45:44,813 --> 00:45:46,030
and you know it.

1089
00:45:46,115 --> 00:45:48,583
I never had that chance,
so what does it matter?

1090
00:45:48,650 --> 00:45:51,002
Because I do.

1091
00:45:51,087 --> 00:45:54,622
What do I want?

1092
00:45:54,673 --> 00:45:56,875
I wanna give
this office back.

1093
00:45:56,959 --> 00:45:59,461
I didn't earn it,
I don't want it,

1094
00:45:59,512 --> 00:46:01,592
and if there's a chance
it'll help Harvey forgive me,

1095
00:46:01,630 --> 00:46:03,598
I'm gonna take it.

1096
00:46:07,103 --> 00:46:09,554
Oh, and, uh,

1097
00:46:09,638 --> 00:46:12,774
if you ever do
send that letter,

1098
00:46:12,841 --> 00:46:15,777
you're in the same boat
as me.

1099
00:46:28,357 --> 00:46:30,191
Harvey,
you're looking determined.

1100
00:46:30,242 --> 00:46:32,827
- I am.
- What can I do for you?

1101
00:46:32,878 --> 00:46:35,880
Look, I know
we had an arrangement,

1102
00:46:35,965 --> 00:46:37,215
but I came here
to change it.

1103
00:46:37,299 --> 00:46:38,216
Change it?

1104
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:39,968
But you might not even win.

1105
00:46:40,035 --> 00:46:42,637
I've just heard about
this new special prosecutor.

1106
00:46:42,704 --> 00:46:44,839
Relax, the case
was always gonna be hard.

1107
00:46:44,890 --> 00:46:46,141
It just got
a little harder.

1108
00:46:46,208 --> 00:46:47,475
Because you made it
that way.

1109
00:46:47,543 --> 00:46:48,810
That's my problem.

1110
00:46:48,877 --> 00:46:51,012
And now you're using
that increased difficulty

1111
00:46:51,063 --> 00:46:52,713
to renegotiate our deal.

1112
00:46:52,765 --> 00:46:56,651
That's your problem.

1113
00:46:56,718 --> 00:46:59,988
We both know
how important Ava is to you.

1114
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:02,774
What do you want?

1115
00:47:02,858 --> 00:47:04,692
I don't wanna run
from a fight.

1116
00:47:04,743 --> 00:47:06,327
Meaning?

1117
00:47:06,395 --> 00:47:07,328
I win,

1118
00:47:07,396 --> 00:47:09,864
you don't fire me,

1119
00:47:09,915 --> 00:47:13,401
you back me
for managing partner.

1120
00:47:13,452 --> 00:47:16,904
You want
to take down Jessica.

1121
00:47:16,956 --> 00:47:18,696
Yes, I do.

1122
00:47:18,697 --> 00:47:23,697
