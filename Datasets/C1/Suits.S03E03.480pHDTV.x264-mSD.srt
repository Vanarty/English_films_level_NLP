1
00:00:00,061 --> 00:00:01,605
Previously on <i>Suits...</i>

2
00:00:02,347 --> 00:00:03,518
Katrina Bennett.

3
00:00:03,519 --> 00:00:04,786
She comes in,
she takes over,

4
00:00:04,853 --> 00:00:06,293
She acts like everything
is her idea.

5
00:00:06,355 --> 00:00:08,123
This wasn't
about a job for me.

6
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:10,125
It was about having a life,

7
00:00:10,192 --> 00:00:12,127
But I guess
you wouldn't understand that.

8
00:00:12,194 --> 00:00:14,796
So you're gonna punish me
by giving me to Louis?

9
00:00:14,863 --> 00:00:15,997
Because you and I are done.

10
00:00:16,048 --> 00:00:18,666
You make me want
to be a better man.

11
00:00:18,718 --> 00:00:20,969
I can't let you do this.

12
00:00:22,838 --> 00:00:25,206
I regret where we are,

13
00:00:25,257 --> 00:00:27,842
And I've been trying to get us
back to where we were.

14
00:00:27,893 --> 00:00:29,677
You're suggesting
bribing a man

15
00:00:29,729 --> 00:00:31,209
to get you out
of your bribery charge.

16
00:00:31,213 --> 00:00:35,016
"In for a penny, in for
a pound," mother always said.

17
00:00:35,067 --> 00:00:36,884
Ava Hessington
doesn't plead no contest.

18
00:00:36,936 --> 00:00:37,936
She pleads guilty.

19
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:39,320
And you get
to call it a win.

20
00:00:39,388 --> 00:00:41,823
I can beat you, and I did.

21
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:43,775
You put me
in that position again,

22
00:00:43,859 --> 00:00:46,361
and I'll do
whatever I have to do to win.

23
00:00:46,412 --> 00:00:48,747
Are you saying screw this
deal, let's kick his ass?

24
00:00:48,831 --> 00:00:51,533
I'm saying take the deal.
We already did.

25
00:00:51,584 --> 00:00:54,569
I win, you back me
for managing partner.

26
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:56,237
You want
to take down Jessica.

27
00:00:56,288 --> 00:00:57,539
I do.

28
00:01:13,973 --> 00:01:15,807
What time
are you coming over?

29
00:01:15,891 --> 00:01:19,277
Um, I thought
we were doing my place.

30
00:01:19,361 --> 00:01:21,596
No, because whenever
I'm at your place,

31
00:01:21,647 --> 00:01:24,699
all I can see is Tess
in a bed sheet.

32
00:01:24,766 --> 00:01:26,201
I'll be there at 9:00.

33
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:33,441
Bran bars are forbidden
to first years.

34
00:01:33,492 --> 00:01:35,493
- Since when?
- Since two seconds ago.

35
00:01:35,578 --> 00:01:37,078
Order of the quartermaster,

36
00:01:37,129 --> 00:01:38,663
who is no longer
speaking with you.

37
00:01:38,747 --> 00:01:40,498
Rachel.
Hmm?

38
00:01:40,583 --> 00:01:41,966
Can you please instruct
the associate to your right

39
00:01:42,051 --> 00:01:43,951
to pass
the nondairy creamer?

40
00:01:44,003 --> 00:01:46,120
Louis, as I have been trying
to tell you in person,

41
00:01:46,172 --> 00:01:48,122
and in the note I left,

42
00:01:48,174 --> 00:01:50,892
and in your voice mail,

43
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:52,427
I'm sorry.

44
00:01:52,478 --> 00:01:53,845
Do you know what
nondairy creamer is, Rachel?

45
00:01:53,929 --> 00:01:55,180
- Uh--
- It's a metaphor.

46
00:01:55,264 --> 00:01:56,898
The first sip, you think
it's real, you know?

47
00:01:56,965 --> 00:01:58,183
After all,
it wants you to believe

48
00:01:58,267 --> 00:01:59,934
that it's genuine
and it's good,

49
00:01:59,985 --> 00:02:02,136
and it's gonna deliver
on its promise.

50
00:02:02,188 --> 00:02:03,571
But then with time,

51
00:02:03,639 --> 00:02:05,679
you realize that it's
just a concoction of chemicals

52
00:02:05,741 --> 00:02:07,325
that's designed
to disguise the truth

53
00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:08,827
that it's actually
full of shit.

54
00:02:08,911 --> 00:02:10,195
Then why
are you drinking it?

55
00:02:10,279 --> 00:02:12,747
I'm lactose intolerant.

56
00:02:24,326 --> 00:02:25,260
I don't accept.

57
00:02:25,327 --> 00:02:26,628
Don't accept what?

58
00:02:26,679 --> 00:02:28,599
Whatever bullshit apology
you're here to give me.

59
00:02:28,631 --> 00:02:29,848
You gave me your word,

60
00:02:29,932 --> 00:02:31,412
and the second
you found out that Mike

61
00:02:31,433 --> 00:02:33,518
was actually gonna say yes,
you couldn't stand it.

62
00:02:33,602 --> 00:02:34,719
You sold me out.

63
00:02:34,803 --> 00:02:36,203
I'm not here
to give you an apology.

64
00:02:36,222 --> 00:02:39,023
I'm here to give you a case.

65
00:02:40,276 --> 00:02:41,809
Those are
the Hessington oil files.

66
00:02:41,861 --> 00:02:43,010
Yeah, you know what, Harvey?

67
00:02:43,062 --> 00:02:44,562
I don't want
your sloppy seconds.

68
00:02:44,647 --> 00:02:46,281
That takeover attempt's
gonna be dead in the water

69
00:02:46,348 --> 00:02:48,283
the second that Ava Hessington's
settlement goes public.

70
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:50,318
Tony Gianopolous isn't
going to just sell his shares

71
00:02:50,369 --> 00:02:51,653
and go away.

72
00:02:51,704 --> 00:02:52,820
You're right.
You know what he's gonna do?

73
00:02:52,872 --> 00:02:54,205
He's gonna
leverage his position,

74
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:55,957
and he's gonna get
as much greenmail as he can.

75
00:02:56,024 --> 00:02:57,659
Which is exactly
why I'm here.

76
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:01,045
You're better suited
to beat him back than I am.

77
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:02,463
You think I don't know that?

78
00:03:02,531 --> 00:03:06,334
I know you know it.
I want you to know I know it.

79
00:03:10,089 --> 00:03:12,974
Leave the box.

80
00:03:15,928 --> 00:03:18,513
Louis,
have you given any thought

81
00:03:18,564 --> 00:03:19,931
to a rebound associate?

82
00:03:20,015 --> 00:03:22,550
Harvey, come on, you know
I'm not that kind of guy.

83
00:03:22,601 --> 00:03:25,987
Come on, you have him
file a few interrogatories,

84
00:03:26,054 --> 00:03:28,022
maybe pick up your dry cleaning,
and then you cut him loose.

85
00:03:28,073 --> 00:03:29,524
With no strings attached?

86
00:03:29,575 --> 00:03:32,860
Better men than you
have done it.

87
00:03:32,912 --> 00:03:33,995
No.

88
00:03:34,062 --> 00:03:35,997
- Yep.
- Who, Baird?

89
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:39,117
A week-long fling
I ended six days too late.

90
00:03:39,201 --> 00:03:40,535
Yeah, but Harvey,

91
00:03:40,586 --> 00:03:42,747
I don't just want a superficial
relationship, you know?

92
00:03:42,755 --> 00:03:44,505
I want a true mentee.

93
00:03:44,573 --> 00:03:46,341
Someone I can take
to the gun club or mudding

94
00:03:46,408 --> 00:03:47,792
or to the origami festival.

95
00:03:47,876 --> 00:03:51,095
Louis, you're gonna find
the right one.

96
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:57,418
Origami festival?
Oh, my God.

97
00:04:09,231 --> 00:04:12,233
Well, this is a surprise.

98
00:04:12,284 --> 00:04:14,485
What?

99
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:18,272
I just never thought I'd see
the great Harriet Specter

100
00:04:18,324 --> 00:04:20,408
making her own copies.

101
00:04:23,295 --> 00:04:26,214
Is that
what this thing does?

102
00:04:26,281 --> 00:04:28,049
You've never made a copy
in your life before, have you?

103
00:04:28,116 --> 00:04:30,501
Of course not,
I'm too busy being a badass

104
00:04:30,586 --> 00:04:31,753
and worrying about my hair.

105
00:04:31,804 --> 00:04:34,005
And your brilliant associate,
Michelle Ross,

106
00:04:34,089 --> 00:04:36,507
does all the hard work
for you anyway.

107
00:04:36,592 --> 00:04:38,893
You're goddamn right
she does.

108
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,729
I'm really sorry

109
00:04:41,797 --> 00:04:44,399
for what I said
about having a life.

110
00:04:44,466 --> 00:04:47,101
I know.

111
00:04:47,152 --> 00:04:49,354
So we're good?

112
00:04:49,438 --> 00:04:50,438
We're good.

113
00:04:50,489 --> 00:04:52,440
And you and Mike,
you're good?

114
00:04:52,491 --> 00:04:53,941
Do you really think
that Harvey

115
00:04:53,993 --> 00:04:55,910
had an emotional epiphany
on his own?

116
00:04:55,977 --> 00:04:57,612
So you did forgive him?

117
00:04:57,663 --> 00:04:58,913
Yes.

118
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:00,248
Well, he doesn't know that.

119
00:05:00,315 --> 00:05:03,167
Which is why I have
a triple-whip, double-fat,

120
00:05:03,252 --> 00:05:06,037
extra shot mocha latte
with caramel.

121
00:05:06,121 --> 00:05:07,488
Fair enough.

122
00:05:07,539 --> 00:05:09,424
But maybe it's time
you told him.

123
00:05:09,491 --> 00:05:11,259
So you decided
not to go back to London?

124
00:05:11,326 --> 00:05:13,177
Well, we have some
unfinished business to discuss,

125
00:05:13,262 --> 00:05:14,879
and I thought it best
to do it in person.

126
00:05:14,963 --> 00:05:16,130
The takeover attempt.

127
00:05:16,181 --> 00:05:18,049
Tony Gianopolous.

128
00:05:18,133 --> 00:05:20,685
Well, I've assigned it
to another attorney,

129
00:05:20,769 --> 00:05:24,522
but before you express
any concern, he's excellent.

130
00:05:24,606 --> 00:05:27,475
Well, not only
do I not have concerns,

131
00:05:27,526 --> 00:05:29,644
I'm glad
you've handed it off.

132
00:05:29,695 --> 00:05:31,479
And why is that?

133
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:33,614
Because that way I know you'll
trust the man you're overseeing

134
00:05:33,682 --> 00:05:37,318
when you come and work for me.

135
00:05:37,369 --> 00:05:39,404
I have to say,
I'm flattered.

136
00:05:39,488 --> 00:05:40,688
I don't want you
to be flattered.

137
00:05:40,739 --> 00:05:42,707
I want you to say yes.

138
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:45,209
As much success as I've had
with that line myself,

139
00:05:45,294 --> 00:05:48,028
I'm afraid
I'm not an oilman.

140
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,497
The oil business
is about oil

141
00:05:49,548 --> 00:05:52,333
as much as you being
a lawyer is about the law.

142
00:05:52,384 --> 00:05:54,802
Every day is a knife fight
in a prison yard,

143
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:58,222
and something tells me
you like a good knife fight.

144
00:05:58,307 --> 00:05:59,757
No rules in a knife fight.

145
00:05:59,842 --> 00:06:02,593
Harvey, I've just lost
my number two.

146
00:06:02,678 --> 00:06:05,346
I can't think of anyone better
to replace him.

147
00:06:05,397 --> 00:06:06,514
Ava

148
00:06:06,565 --> 00:06:08,182
I'm a woman
who gets what I want,

149
00:06:08,233 --> 00:06:10,234
and I am willing
to pay for it.

150
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:12,720
Don't get me wrong,
I'm happy to whore myself out.

151
00:06:12,771 --> 00:06:15,273
I just prefer to have
more than one client.

152
00:06:15,357 --> 00:06:18,076
Harvey, what a coincidence.

153
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,445
Cameron, I'm surprised
you can afford this place

154
00:06:20,529 --> 00:06:22,330
now that
you're unemployed again.

155
00:06:22,397 --> 00:06:24,949
Well, my temporary gig
isn't over just yet.

156
00:06:25,033 --> 00:06:27,902
You may think
you have them fooled, Cameron,

157
00:06:27,953 --> 00:06:30,070
but they'll figure you out
eventually.

158
00:06:30,122 --> 00:06:31,071
You didn't.

159
00:06:31,123 --> 00:06:32,373
What are you talking about?

160
00:06:32,424 --> 00:06:34,208
Ava Hessington,
you're under arrest.

161
00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:35,793
- What?
- On what charge?

162
00:06:35,878 --> 00:06:38,078
Conspiracy
to commit murder.

163
00:06:41,049 --> 00:06:43,250
This is bullshit, Cameron.
We had a deal.

164
00:06:43,302 --> 00:06:44,585
A deal where your client

165
00:06:44,636 --> 00:06:47,388
admitted to bribing
a foreign official.

166
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:49,223
That Colonel
that she paid off?

167
00:06:49,274 --> 00:06:51,759
After that, six people
were killed by his troops.

168
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:54,529
I give my driver a tip,
and then he runs over someone.

169
00:06:54,596 --> 00:06:56,364
Doesn't mean I had
anything to do with it.

170
00:06:56,431 --> 00:06:58,032
But if the person
he hit was me,

171
00:06:58,099 --> 00:06:59,567
sure would look like that.

172
00:06:59,618 --> 00:07:01,786
What the hell
are you talking about?

173
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:03,621
All six people
did whatever they could

174
00:07:03,705 --> 00:07:05,823
to stop your client
from getting her pipeline.

175
00:07:05,908 --> 00:07:07,658
If that's all you got,
you don't have shit.

176
00:07:07,743 --> 00:07:09,377
She did this, Harvey.
You don't know her.

177
00:07:09,444 --> 00:07:10,945
Yeah, but I know you,

178
00:07:10,996 --> 00:07:11,996
and you don't give a damn

179
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,048
about murder
in some foreign country.

180
00:07:14,115 --> 00:07:15,750
You took this case
to stick it to me.

181
00:07:15,801 --> 00:07:17,418
And I did.

182
00:07:17,469 --> 00:07:18,920
She admitted that was a bribe

183
00:07:18,971 --> 00:07:20,421
because she never thought we
would tie her to those deaths,

184
00:07:20,472 --> 00:07:21,472
and now I got her.

185
00:07:21,557 --> 00:07:22,678
And you didn't
see it coming,

186
00:07:22,758 --> 00:07:26,811

you can do about it.

197
00:08:10,452 --> 00:08:11,819
What do you need me to do?

198
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:13,087
Whatever you have to
to get Ava out,

199
00:08:13,155 --> 00:08:14,622
because Cameron's gonna
try and keep her in.

200
00:08:14,673 --> 00:08:16,207
You really think he's gonna
try and deny her bail?

201
00:08:16,291 --> 00:08:17,592
- I know it.
- Harvey, one thing.

202
00:08:17,659 --> 00:08:19,260
Hey, look, if you have
a problem defending someone

203
00:08:19,327 --> 00:08:21,629
who's accused of murder,
I don't want to hear it.

204
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,264
Look, you won't, 'cause I'm
willing to do whatever it takes

205
00:08:23,331 --> 00:08:26,551
to win
whether she's innocent or not.

206
00:08:26,635 --> 00:08:28,603
Then come with me.

207
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:30,805
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
I'm going to see Ava with you?

208
00:08:30,856 --> 00:08:32,190
- Yep.
- Yeah, baby!

209
00:08:32,274 --> 00:08:33,608
Butch and Sundance are back.

210
00:08:33,675 --> 00:08:35,443
Ooh, no go.

211
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:37,278
What do--what do--
what do you mean, "no go"?

212
00:08:37,345 --> 00:08:38,785
I mean, you're not
butch or Sundance.

213
00:08:38,847 --> 00:08:39,781
Why not?

214
00:08:39,848 --> 00:08:41,015
'Cause Butch was the leader,

215
00:08:41,066 --> 00:08:43,117
and Sundance was the gunslinger,
and I'm both.

216
00:08:43,185 --> 00:08:44,685
Okay, but Sundance
couldn't swim,

217
00:08:44,737 --> 00:08:47,238
and Butch never shot anyone,
so that makes you a loser.

218
00:08:47,322 --> 00:08:48,489
Better than a fraud.

219
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:49,707
I think it's time
for some new material.

220
00:08:49,792 --> 00:08:51,692
You write
<i>Midnight Train to Georgia,</i>

221
00:08:51,744 --> 00:08:53,244
you don't just
sing it once.

222
00:08:53,328 --> 00:08:57,248
And speaking of Butch Cassidy,
let's go start a knife fight.

223
00:08:57,332 --> 00:08:58,716
Uh, Norma,

224
00:08:58,801 --> 00:09:02,036
I just want you, from now on,
to just try to wear socks,

225
00:09:02,087 --> 00:09:05,306
because if you--
there isn't--

226
00:09:08,594 --> 00:09:09,710
and what is that?

227
00:09:09,762 --> 00:09:11,345
Hessington oil's earnings
per share

228
00:09:11,397 --> 00:09:14,982
and market cap growth
over the last 11.2 years.

229
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:17,151
Somebody ask you
to do this?

230
00:09:17,219 --> 00:09:19,237
I didn't do it because
somebody asked me to, Louis.

231
00:09:19,321 --> 00:09:23,491
I did it
because I want in on the case.

232
00:09:23,558 --> 00:09:25,276
You know, you realize
something like this

233
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,495
would entail
working hand in glove

234
00:09:27,562 --> 00:09:31,616
and possibly even
a trip or two to the mud club.

235
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:34,168
I'm in.

236
00:09:34,236 --> 00:09:35,169
And what makes you think
you're good enough

237
00:09:35,237 --> 00:09:36,504
to be my personal associate?

238
00:09:36,571 --> 00:09:38,673
I don't want to be
your personal associate.

239
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:41,075
- What?
- I'm a fifth year.

240
00:09:41,126 --> 00:09:43,344
I don't want to be
anyone's personal associate,

241
00:09:43,412 --> 00:09:47,014
but I know how good you are,
you know how good I am.

242
00:09:47,082 --> 00:09:48,132
We can use each other.

243
00:09:48,217 --> 00:09:52,019
Hmm.
Like a symbiotic relationship.

244
00:09:52,087 --> 00:09:53,554
Like between a phytoplankton
and a whale.

245
00:09:53,605 --> 00:09:56,691
I'm not familiar
with their specific dynamic,

246
00:09:56,758 --> 00:09:58,309
but, yes, exactly.

247
00:09:58,393 --> 00:10:01,562
Well, Katrina, I kind of
had enough of being used

248
00:10:01,613 --> 00:10:03,693
by associates looking to move
one rung up the ladder,

249
00:10:03,699 --> 00:10:05,817
so I suggest you get
the hell out of my office

250
00:10:05,901 --> 00:10:08,402
and find yourself
another whale.

251
00:10:17,796 --> 00:10:20,498
Did you know
about these murders?

252
00:10:20,582 --> 00:10:22,583
I knew there was
a demonstration,

253
00:10:22,634 --> 00:10:25,386
it turned ugly,
and that people died.

254
00:10:25,453 --> 00:10:26,471
Did you know those people

255
00:10:26,555 --> 00:10:27,889
were the leaders
of the demonstration?

256
00:10:27,956 --> 00:10:29,090
No.

257
00:10:29,141 --> 00:10:30,591
Did you know the military
was responsible?

258
00:10:30,642 --> 00:10:33,511
All I know about these deaths
is that they happened.

259
00:10:33,595 --> 00:10:35,263
On your land.

260
00:10:35,314 --> 00:10:38,683
We own thousands of acres.
It's a volatile country.

261
00:10:38,767 --> 00:10:40,651
People kill each other
on a regular basis.

262
00:10:40,736 --> 00:10:41,903
So you just chalk it up
to coincidence

263
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:44,272
that the six leaders
of this demonstration,

264
00:10:44,323 --> 00:10:47,158
against
your company's policies,

265
00:10:47,242 --> 00:10:49,994
on your company's
private property, were murdered?

266
00:10:50,078 --> 00:10:53,247
It was reported as
a combat incident, not a murder.

267
00:10:53,315 --> 00:10:54,315
You just said all you know
about these deaths

268
00:10:54,366 --> 00:10:55,583
is that they happened.

269
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:56,834
Now you know
it was a combat incident.

270
00:10:56,919 --> 00:10:57,919
Which one is it?

271
00:10:57,986 --> 00:10:59,370
Harvey,
what the hell is this,

272
00:10:59,454 --> 00:11:00,705
and who the hell
does he think he is?

273
00:11:00,789 --> 00:11:02,823
Mike's just doing his job.

274
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:04,342
Well, Mike,

275
00:11:04,426 --> 00:11:07,712
every death in that country is
reported as a combat incident,

276
00:11:07,796 --> 00:11:09,496
and for your information,

277
00:11:09,548 --> 00:11:11,933
there were thousands of people
opposed to our pipeline.

278
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,435
That's all we need
right now.

279
00:11:18,607 --> 00:11:20,808
Would you
please excuse us?

280
00:11:31,703 --> 00:11:33,571
How exactly did you manage
to get your head

281
00:11:33,655 --> 00:11:35,957
so far up your own ass?

282
00:11:36,024 --> 00:11:38,459
You told me
to take this deal.

283
00:11:38,527 --> 00:11:40,278
I did,
and now here I am.

284
00:11:40,362 --> 00:11:42,563
I didn't know
about these murders.

285
00:11:42,614 --> 00:11:44,949
What you don't seem to believe
is neither did I.

286
00:11:45,033 --> 00:11:46,433
We were doing our job.

287
00:11:46,485 --> 00:11:49,871
Cameron Dennis
will come at you with worse.

288
00:11:49,938 --> 00:11:51,289
Do you think
I did this?

289
00:11:51,373 --> 00:11:53,124
That's irrelevant.

290
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:56,711
I just want to make sure I know
all the evidence against you.

291
00:11:56,778 --> 00:11:58,329
I have no idea
what the evidence is,

292
00:11:58,413 --> 00:11:59,964
because I had
nothing to do with it,

293
00:12:00,048 --> 00:12:03,050
and you say it's irrelevant,
but it's not irrelevant to me.

294
00:12:03,118 --> 00:12:05,519
Do you think I did this?

295
00:12:05,587 --> 00:12:06,637
Do you want a lawyer

296
00:12:06,722 --> 00:12:08,122
who thinks
you're innocent and loses

297
00:12:08,123 --> 00:12:10,675
or a lawyer who doesn't
want to know and wins?

298
00:12:10,759 --> 00:12:12,393
You know
the answer to that.

299
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:14,145
Then don't ask me
that question again,

300
00:12:14,229 --> 00:12:15,963
'cause after I win
and you're free,

301
00:12:16,014 --> 00:12:18,966
what I think won't matter.

302
00:12:23,105 --> 00:12:25,189
So what did she want
to talk to you about?

303
00:12:25,274 --> 00:12:26,941
She wanted to know
if you were single.

304
00:12:26,992 --> 00:12:28,359
Listen, when you
get back to the office--

305
00:12:28,443 --> 00:12:29,660
Wait, what do you mean?

306
00:12:29,745 --> 00:12:31,028
What do you mean,
what do I mean?

307
00:12:31,113 --> 00:12:33,781
I mean, I thought we were
gonna go back together.

308
00:12:33,832 --> 00:12:35,416
I don't know, I thought we could
get some lunch or something.

309
00:12:35,483 --> 00:12:36,650
Like what?

310
00:12:36,702 --> 00:12:39,086
I don't know.
Like, maybe steak or something.

311
00:12:39,154 --> 00:12:40,504
It's the middle of the day.

312
00:12:40,589 --> 00:12:42,957
Yeah, Harvey, that's when
people usually eat lunch.

313
00:12:43,008 --> 00:12:45,209
This is about Louis,
isn't it?

314
00:12:45,294 --> 00:12:47,178
What? No.
Maybe.

315
00:12:47,262 --> 00:12:48,823
So I'm supposed to
take you mudding now?

316
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:50,548
That's not the point.

317
00:12:50,632 --> 00:12:52,633
Look, let's just concentrate
on winning this thing,

318
00:12:52,684 --> 00:12:53,884
and when it's over,
we can talk

319
00:12:53,885 --> 00:12:55,770
about lunch, dinner,
or anything else.

320
00:12:55,837 --> 00:12:56,771
Whoa, whoa,
you really mean that?

321
00:12:56,838 --> 00:12:58,306
No.

322
00:12:58,357 --> 00:13:00,641
Butch and Sundance are back.

323
00:13:24,866 --> 00:13:25,967
What are you doing?

324
00:13:26,034 --> 00:13:27,585
Dropping off
something for Harvey.

325
00:13:27,669 --> 00:13:29,920
You don't have
any cases with Harvey.

326
00:13:30,005 --> 00:13:31,705
I will when he sees
what's in here.

327
00:13:31,757 --> 00:13:32,974
No.

328
00:13:33,041 --> 00:13:35,042
You're not taking credit
for my ideas again.

329
00:13:35,093 --> 00:13:36,677
Harvey's gonna know
I built this airplane.

330
00:13:36,728 --> 00:13:38,512
Harvey's not gonna
know anything.

331
00:13:38,563 --> 00:13:39,981
You're a little late
to the party.

332
00:13:40,048 --> 00:13:41,315
He and I
are working together again.

333
00:13:41,383 --> 00:13:43,401
I'm not looking
to take your place.

334
00:13:43,485 --> 00:13:44,819
Oh, really?

335
00:13:44,886 --> 00:13:46,437
You just happened to prepare
a document for him,

336
00:13:46,521 --> 00:13:48,105
thinking he didn't
have an associate?

337
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:49,907
He's working a case
that I'm right for.

338
00:13:49,992 --> 00:13:52,226
That's not how it works
around here.

339
00:13:52,277 --> 00:13:53,861
I handle all of his cases.

340
00:13:53,912 --> 00:13:55,279
Does Harvey know that?

341
00:13:55,364 --> 00:13:58,232
What Harvey knows
is that I'm the "A" team,

342
00:13:58,283 --> 00:14:00,401
and you're the "B" team,
so you can leave the folder,

343
00:14:00,452 --> 00:14:01,919
or you can take it
with you,

344
00:14:02,004 --> 00:14:03,254
but if you're looking to ride
some partner's coattails,

345
00:14:03,338 --> 00:14:05,623
you're gonna have
to look somewhere else.

346
00:14:05,707 --> 00:14:08,843
Well, the "B" team
worked at the D.A.'s office

347
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:10,344
and came up
with a defense strategy

348
00:14:10,412 --> 00:14:13,514
based on a specific knowledge
of Cameron Dennis.

349
00:14:13,581 --> 00:14:15,633
The "A" team
quotes him movies.

350
00:14:15,717 --> 00:14:18,185
We'll see who Harvey does
and doesn't value.

351
00:14:18,253 --> 00:14:21,472
Katrina,
Mike is Harvey's guy.

352
00:14:21,556 --> 00:14:23,557
When he tells you
he's speaking for Harvey,

353
00:14:23,608 --> 00:14:25,059
he's speaking for Harvey.

354
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:26,143
And please don't
come into this office

355
00:14:26,228 --> 00:14:30,398
when I'm away
from my desk again.

356
00:14:36,455 --> 00:14:38,939
Boy, am I glad I never
snuck into Harvey's office

357
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:42,626
when you
weren't around before.

358
00:14:42,711 --> 00:14:43,994
Thanks, Donna.

359
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:45,629
I still expect
free, exotic,

360
00:14:45,714 --> 00:14:49,717
caffeinated beverages
for the foreseeable future.

361
00:14:53,335 --> 00:14:55,108
Cameron Dennis.
Son of a bitch.

362
00:14:55,193 --> 00:14:56,276
He played us.

363
00:14:56,327 --> 00:14:57,861
He slid that guilty plea
right by.

364
00:14:57,946 --> 00:15:00,147
I should've seen it coming.
We should've seen it coming.

365
00:15:00,164 --> 00:15:02,449
I'm the one that convinced you
to take that deal.

366
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,834
What's done is done.

367
00:15:03,918 --> 00:15:05,669
Question is,
what's being done?

368
00:15:05,753 --> 00:15:08,038
I'm working on getting Ava
off these charges,

369
00:15:08,122 --> 00:15:10,674
and I got Mike working
on getting her out on bail.

370
00:15:10,758 --> 00:15:12,209
So you're back with him.

371
00:15:12,293 --> 00:15:13,994
What's the point
of having a right arm

372
00:15:14,045 --> 00:15:15,429
without a right hand?

373
00:15:15,496 --> 00:15:17,431
- Good.
- Is it?

374
00:15:17,498 --> 00:15:19,383
- What do you mean?
- I mean, he threatened you.

375
00:15:19,467 --> 00:15:20,601
I've never known you
to be forgiving

376
00:15:20,668 --> 00:15:22,102
with someone
who threatened you.

377
00:15:22,169 --> 00:15:24,938
I've never known you to be
particularly forgiving either.

378
00:15:30,979 --> 00:15:32,646
Um, I'm sorry,
I'll come back.

379
00:15:32,697 --> 00:15:33,981
It's okay.

380
00:15:34,032 --> 00:15:35,699
We're all good.

381
00:15:35,783 --> 00:15:38,035
We're good?

382
00:15:38,119 --> 00:15:39,736
When you work with tigers,

383
00:15:39,821 --> 00:15:43,073
once in a while, they're gonna
take a swipe at you.

384
00:15:43,157 --> 00:15:44,708
I like working with tigers.

385
00:15:44,792 --> 00:15:48,462
Of course, when they get out of
hand, you have to put them down.

386
00:15:48,529 --> 00:15:53,033
Now, where are we on the prep
for Ava's bail hearing?

387
00:15:53,084 --> 00:15:54,468
Well, I was thinking,

388
00:15:54,535 --> 00:15:58,038
since Cameron used the
settlement to double-cross us,

389
00:15:58,106 --> 00:16:01,141
why don't we use the bail
hearing to double-cross him?

390
00:16:03,311 --> 00:16:04,344
Your Honor,
this is not

391
00:16:04,395 --> 00:16:06,146
a Ponzi scheme
or insider trading,

392
00:16:06,213 --> 00:16:07,681
this is cold-blooded murder.

393
00:16:07,732 --> 00:16:09,099
Prosecution moves
that bail be denied.

394
00:16:09,183 --> 00:16:11,735
That's ridiculous.
My client's not going anywhere.

395
00:16:11,819 --> 00:16:12,986
She's got a business to run.

396
00:16:13,054 --> 00:16:14,187
Let's look
at how she does business.

397
00:16:14,238 --> 00:16:17,357
Less than 48 hours ago,
she admitted to bribery.

398
00:16:17,408 --> 00:16:19,242
You want to talk
about how she does business?

399
00:16:19,327 --> 00:16:21,161
Let's talk
about how you do business.

400
00:16:21,228 --> 00:16:23,497
Your Honor,
I have a list of 87 murder cases

401
00:16:23,564 --> 00:16:25,332
that Cameron Dennis
tried as a D.A.

402
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:27,751
In each instance, he allowed
reasonable bail to be set.

403
00:16:27,835 --> 00:16:30,236
I allowed bail
because gangbangers

404
00:16:30,288 --> 00:16:33,040
don't have a fraction
of Ms. Hessington's resources.

405
00:16:33,091 --> 00:16:35,425
You allowed bail
because you didn't give a damn

406
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:37,961
about those guys,
and this is personal.

407
00:16:38,046 --> 00:16:40,931
It's why you took the case,
it's why you hid a witness,

408
00:16:41,015 --> 00:16:44,184
and it's why you negotiated
a settlement in bad faith.

409
00:16:44,251 --> 00:16:47,104
My chambers now.

410
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:51,441
You bring an accusation
like that into my courtroom,

411
00:16:51,526 --> 00:16:52,643
you better be able
to back it up.

412
00:16:52,727 --> 00:16:54,361
Your Honor,
when I told him

413
00:16:54,428 --> 00:16:55,828
he took this case
to stick it to me,

414
00:16:55,863 --> 00:16:57,898
he said, quote, "I did,

415
00:16:57,949 --> 00:17:00,233
and now I got her,
and you didn't see it coming."

416
00:17:00,284 --> 00:17:01,401
You know what, Your Honor?

417
00:17:01,452 --> 00:17:02,602
He's right.
I am sticking it to him.

418
00:17:02,654 --> 00:17:04,454
Guilty as charged,
just like his client.

419
00:17:04,539 --> 00:17:05,656
- Okay, let me--
- That's enough.

420
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:07,324
I am not a washing machine.

421
00:17:07,408 --> 00:17:10,627
You two are not here
to air your dirty laundry.

422
00:17:10,712 --> 00:17:12,713
She admitted to bribing
a Colonel in the army,

423
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:14,581
and that same army
killed these people.

424
00:17:14,632 --> 00:17:17,467
Three environmentalists
died in the polar ice cap.

425
00:17:17,552 --> 00:17:19,833
You think she killed them also?
Maybe I'll look into that.

426
00:17:19,887 --> 00:17:21,672
You gonna leak it
to a corporate raider too?

427
00:17:21,756 --> 00:17:23,006
What's he talking about?

428
00:17:23,091 --> 00:17:24,290
I'm talking about the fact
that he leaked

429
00:17:24,342 --> 00:17:26,143
this whole thing
to Tony Gianopolous.

430
00:17:26,227 --> 00:17:27,728
This is a personal vendetta,

431
00:17:27,795 --> 00:17:31,064
and he has no concrete evidence
against my client.

432
00:17:31,132 --> 00:17:32,966
Not only do I want no bail,

433
00:17:33,017 --> 00:17:35,018
I want you to throw
this case out right now.

434
00:17:35,103 --> 00:17:36,737
Well, I'm not gonna do that.

435
00:17:36,804 --> 00:17:39,272
But I'll tell you something,
Mr. Dennis,

436
00:17:39,323 --> 00:17:41,942
I am setting bail at $1.

437
00:17:41,993 --> 00:17:44,077
And if you don't
have any evidence,

438
00:17:44,145 --> 00:17:46,446
I'm gonna hear his motion
for summary judgment,

439
00:17:46,497 --> 00:17:47,948
rule in his favor,

440
00:17:47,999 --> 00:17:50,984
and this trial is going to be
over before it even starts.

441
00:18:25,403 --> 00:18:28,038
Bloody hell.

442
00:18:31,525 --> 00:18:35,361
Um, excuse me, do you not
see me sitting here?

443
00:18:35,413 --> 00:18:38,632
Yeah, I saw you.
I just chose to ignore you.

444
00:18:38,699 --> 00:18:40,133
You must like
living dangerously.

445
00:18:40,201 --> 00:18:42,252
I do, and that's
why stopping here,

446
00:18:42,336 --> 00:18:45,222
doing this with you,
well, that's playing with fire.

447
00:18:45,306 --> 00:18:46,757
There's nothing wrong with
a little casual conversation.

448
00:18:46,841 --> 00:18:48,708
What happens
when casual conversation

449
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,093
becomes serious fun?

450
00:18:50,178 --> 00:18:52,095
Oh, you're good.

451
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:55,982
I can promise you,
I'm better than good.

452
00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:59,069
Stephen Huntley,
senior partner, London office.

453
00:18:59,153 --> 00:19:00,070
Donna.

454
00:19:00,154 --> 00:19:01,905
Just Donna?

455
00:19:01,989 --> 00:19:03,990
Yeah, it's like a name
and a title in one.

456
00:19:04,058 --> 00:19:05,242
You'll see.

457
00:19:05,326 --> 00:19:06,893
I've heard.

458
00:19:06,944 --> 00:19:08,495
Secretarial pool's
been buzzing

459
00:19:08,562 --> 00:19:10,413
about some new, feisty ginger
for a fortnight.

460
00:19:10,498 --> 00:19:11,782
Look, if you're trying
to charm your way

461
00:19:11,866 --> 00:19:13,250
into Harvey's office,
it's not gonna happen.

462
00:19:13,334 --> 00:19:14,668
Mm, no, I'm not trying
to charm my way

463
00:19:14,735 --> 00:19:15,836
into Harvey's office.

464
00:19:15,903 --> 00:19:17,370
Oh, what were you
trying for?

465
00:19:17,421 --> 00:19:19,172
Well, actually,
I was gonna try for--

466
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,340
Donna, I need you
to send Louis

467
00:19:20,407 --> 00:19:22,042
everything we have
on Tony Gianopolous.

468
00:19:22,093 --> 00:19:23,126
He's running point.

469
00:19:23,211 --> 00:19:24,544
Harvey, a pleasure.
I'm Stephen.

470
00:19:24,595 --> 00:19:26,847
I know who you are,
and I know why you're here.

471
00:19:26,914 --> 00:19:30,267
You're Darby's fixer, and you're
here to hijack my case.

472
00:19:33,271 --> 00:19:34,387
Did you text him
whilst we were--

473
00:19:34,438 --> 00:19:37,107
You said you're good?

474
00:19:37,191 --> 00:19:38,441
I'm good too.

475
00:19:38,526 --> 00:19:41,061
This isn't over.

476
00:19:41,112 --> 00:19:42,896
Is that a threat?

477
00:19:42,947 --> 00:19:43,930
Mm, you take it
in whatever tone

478
00:19:43,981 --> 00:19:46,933
pleases you the most.

479
00:19:51,455 --> 00:19:52,906
You're right.

480
00:19:52,957 --> 00:19:56,326
I am Darby's fixer, but I'm not
here to hijack anything.

481
00:19:56,410 --> 00:19:57,744
When I got on a plane
at Heathrow,

482
00:19:57,795 --> 00:20:00,046
this was still
merely bribery.

483
00:20:00,114 --> 00:20:01,581
I've only just learned
of the murder charges now

484
00:20:01,632 --> 00:20:02,883
as I touched down.

485
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:06,786
It just means the timing
changed, not the motive.

486
00:20:06,838 --> 00:20:09,639
Forget the bombshell
the prosecution's just dropped.

487
00:20:09,724 --> 00:20:13,894
Let's talk about the bombshell
outside your office.

488
00:20:13,961 --> 00:20:16,012
Donna?

489
00:20:16,097 --> 00:20:17,463
She's got a body
like Elizabeth Hurley

490
00:20:17,515 --> 00:20:19,015
and the sass
of Maggie Thatcher.

491
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:21,268
I went out with Liz.

492
00:20:21,319 --> 00:20:23,687
Don't sell her short
in the sass department.

493
00:20:23,771 --> 00:20:26,106
Oh, I'm well aware
of her sass.

494
00:20:26,157 --> 00:20:27,107
'99.

495
00:20:27,158 --> 00:20:28,241
'98.

496
00:20:28,309 --> 00:20:30,143
Really?

497
00:20:30,194 --> 00:20:31,995
Well, you're obviously
a better man than I am.

498
00:20:31,996 --> 00:20:34,814
Don't beat yourself up.
You got plenty of company.

499
00:20:34,866 --> 00:20:37,150
By the way,
before you say anything else,

500
00:20:37,201 --> 00:20:40,370
she can hear
every word we say.

501
00:20:40,454 --> 00:20:42,756
Now, I've got
a murder charge to defend,

502
00:20:42,823 --> 00:20:45,125
so why don't you tell me
why the hell you're really here?

503
00:20:45,176 --> 00:20:48,211
Well, I'm here to oversee
cultural integration.

504
00:20:48,296 --> 00:20:49,930
Cultural integration.

505
00:20:49,997 --> 00:20:52,432
Standard part of the merger,
been on the books for two weeks.

506
00:20:52,499 --> 00:20:53,516
And why do you need me?

507
00:20:53,601 --> 00:20:55,101
Well, smoothing over

508
00:20:55,169 --> 00:20:57,304
these transitional periods
is never easy.

509
00:20:57,355 --> 00:20:59,522
It's not child's play.

510
00:20:59,607 --> 00:21:02,359
You're an influencer here.
People listen to you.

511
00:21:02,443 --> 00:21:04,527
I want you to help them
listen to me.

512
00:21:04,612 --> 00:21:06,029
I get it.

513
00:21:06,113 --> 00:21:08,148
You want me
to pave the way for you.

514
00:21:08,199 --> 00:21:09,532
Here's the thing.

515
00:21:09,617 --> 00:21:11,985
I don't pave the way
for people.

516
00:21:12,036 --> 00:21:14,154
People pave the way for me.

517
00:21:15,489 --> 00:21:17,407
Mm.

518
00:21:17,491 --> 00:21:19,209
I get it.

519
00:21:19,293 --> 00:21:22,045
Steer clear of you,
and you and I

520
00:21:22,129 --> 00:21:25,498
will get along
just fine.

521
00:21:25,549 --> 00:21:29,135
Welcome to New York.

522
00:21:36,427 --> 00:21:38,063
So, have you met
Stephen Huntley yet.

523
00:21:38,147 --> 00:21:39,897
- I did.
- What'd you think?

524
00:21:39,948 --> 00:21:41,509
Turns out we have
some things in common.

525
00:21:41,567 --> 00:21:45,770
Turns out he didn't
show up empty-handed.

526
00:21:45,821 --> 00:21:47,038
That's $1/2 million.

527
00:21:47,105 --> 00:21:48,623
Mmhmm, first dividend check
of the merger.

528
00:21:48,707 --> 00:21:49,907
That was my buy-in amount.

529
00:21:49,958 --> 00:21:52,460
Maybe it wasn't
such a bad idea after all.

530
00:21:52,544 --> 00:21:55,129
Wait a second.
What was your check for?

531
00:21:55,214 --> 00:21:56,414
More than that.

532
00:21:56,465 --> 00:21:57,498
1.2?

533
00:21:57,583 --> 00:21:59,000
I'm not telling.

534
00:21:59,084 --> 00:22:01,886
1.5?

535
00:22:01,953 --> 00:22:03,755
You're three times
more valuable than me?

536
00:22:03,806 --> 00:22:06,307
Oh, I don't think that.
The check thinks that.

537
00:22:06,392 --> 00:22:07,558
Does the check think
the only thing

538
00:22:07,626 --> 00:22:09,644
that guy's here for
is cultural integration?

539
00:22:09,728 --> 00:22:11,929
The check
wasn't born yesterday.

540
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:13,398
He is to Darby
what you are to me,

541
00:22:13,465 --> 00:22:14,932
and I wouldn't send you
to do that.

542
00:22:14,983 --> 00:22:15,983
No, you wouldn't.

543
00:22:16,068 --> 00:22:17,351
So what'd you tell him?

544
00:22:17,436 --> 00:22:19,821
I told him as long
as he steers clear of me,

545
00:22:19,905 --> 00:22:20,822
he'll be fine.

546
00:22:20,906 --> 00:22:22,190
You told him wrong.

547
00:22:22,274 --> 00:22:26,527
I want you to find out
what the hell that guy's up to.

548
00:22:28,247 --> 00:22:30,331
She's right, you know.

549
00:22:30,416 --> 00:22:32,333
Cultural integration's
scheduled for a week.

550
00:22:32,418 --> 00:22:35,753
Stephen Huntley booked a room
at the Peninsula for a month.

551
00:22:35,821 --> 00:22:37,622
Is it a room or a suite?
It's important.

552
00:22:37,673 --> 00:22:39,791
- A suite.
- Good work.

553
00:22:39,842 --> 00:22:42,126
- It's what I do.
- There's only one problem.

554
00:22:42,177 --> 00:22:46,547
Jessica just told me
to look into him one second ago.

555
00:22:46,632 --> 00:22:48,716
- I anticipated her needs.
- No, you didn't.

556
00:22:48,801 --> 00:22:50,968
I anticipated your needs?

557
00:22:51,019 --> 00:22:53,638
You anticipated your needs.
And by "your needs," I mean--

558
00:22:53,689 --> 00:22:56,474
Okay, my needs are not
the topic of this conversation.

559
00:22:56,525 --> 00:22:57,942
All I'm saying is,
you went to the trouble

560
00:22:58,009 --> 00:23:01,028
of specifically finding out
he booked a suite.

561
00:23:01,113 --> 00:23:04,031
- W--
- Save it.

562
00:23:13,542 --> 00:23:15,326
Can I talk to you
for a second?

563
00:23:15,377 --> 00:23:19,697
Not if it's about working
with Harvey on this case.

564
00:23:19,748 --> 00:23:23,718
Look, this isn't easy for me
to do, but for some reason,

565
00:23:23,802 --> 00:23:27,305
you and I keep locking horns,
and now I'm out in the cold.

566
00:23:27,372 --> 00:23:29,924
I know how I got here, but
I don't know how to get back.

567
00:23:30,008 --> 00:23:31,509
What do you want, Katrina?

568
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:34,479
I want to figure out a way
we can coexist in this firm.

569
00:23:34,546 --> 00:23:35,713
You want to know a way?

570
00:23:35,764 --> 00:23:37,882
When you see me coming,
give me a wide berth.

571
00:23:37,933 --> 00:23:40,067
You know what?
I'm apologizing to you.

572
00:23:40,152 --> 00:23:41,903
You don't have to be a dick.

573
00:23:41,987 --> 00:23:43,404
I'm a dick?

574
00:23:43,489 --> 00:23:45,222
You have treated
everyone at this firm

575
00:23:45,274 --> 00:23:47,441
below your station
like shit.

576
00:23:47,526 --> 00:23:49,610
Now all of a sudden
you want to be my best friend?

577
00:23:49,695 --> 00:23:51,445
Oh, I get it.

578
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:52,897
This isn't about me and you.

579
00:23:52,948 --> 00:23:55,750
This is about me
and your little girlfriend.

580
00:23:55,834 --> 00:23:58,286
Rachel
is not my girlfriend.

581
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:02,173
This has nothing to do with her,
and this conversation is over.

582
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:07,178
Funny how you know exactly
who I was talking about.

583
00:24:16,254 --> 00:24:20,424
Thank you.

584
00:24:20,475 --> 00:24:23,361
Harvey, to what do I owe
the pleasure of this lunch?

585
00:24:23,428 --> 00:24:25,313
I wanted to thank you
for the check.

586
00:24:25,397 --> 00:24:27,732
Oh, I thought
that'd change your attitude.

587
00:24:27,783 --> 00:24:28,783
It did.

588
00:24:28,867 --> 00:24:30,618
In fact,
you gave something to me,

589
00:24:30,702 --> 00:24:32,153
I want to give
something to you.

590
00:24:32,237 --> 00:24:35,105
What is it?

591
00:24:35,157 --> 00:24:36,207
It's a hotel bill.

592
00:24:36,274 --> 00:24:39,460
I paid it.
Then I checked you out.

593
00:24:39,545 --> 00:24:42,780
Hope you left housekeeping
a hefty gratuity.

594
00:24:42,831 --> 00:24:43,998
You're not here
to deliver checks

595
00:24:44,082 --> 00:24:45,967
or make
smooth transitions,

596
00:24:46,051 --> 00:24:47,718
and if you're not
gonna tell me the truth,

597
00:24:47,786 --> 00:24:49,220
you don't need
to be here at all.

598
00:24:49,287 --> 00:24:50,421
Well, that's gonna make it

599
00:24:50,472 --> 00:24:53,808
extremely difficult
for me to help you

600
00:24:53,892 --> 00:24:56,811
take over the firm
from Jessica.

601
00:24:56,895 --> 00:24:58,963
I know about your deal
with Edward.

602
00:24:59,014 --> 00:25:00,097
He sent me here to help.

603
00:25:00,148 --> 00:25:01,816
Why didn't you
tell me this before?

604
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,234
Well, you told me
Miss Moneypenny was listening.

605
00:25:03,301 --> 00:25:05,152
I didn't know
whether you wanted her to hear.

606
00:25:05,237 --> 00:25:09,607
So you're here to help me
take over the firm from Jessica?

607
00:25:09,658 --> 00:25:12,577
What exactly does that mean?
You know what it means.

608
00:25:12,644 --> 00:25:14,779
I don't need you
baby-sitting me on this case.

609
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:15,947
I'm not a baby-sitter.

610
00:25:15,998 --> 00:25:18,916
I'm a fixer.
I'm here to help you.

611
00:25:18,984 --> 00:25:20,117
Now why would you
turn that down?

612
00:25:20,168 --> 00:25:22,003
What's to stop you
from using this

613
00:25:22,087 --> 00:25:23,454
to take over
the firm from me?

614
00:25:23,505 --> 00:25:24,789
I'm not like you.

615
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:27,341
I don't care to have
my name on the door.

616
00:25:27,426 --> 00:25:29,677
So you're here
just to help me.

617
00:25:29,761 --> 00:25:31,429
You don't need
anything in return.

618
00:25:31,496 --> 00:25:33,598
Your car club has a pair

619
00:25:33,665 --> 00:25:36,801
of mint 1956
Porsche speedsters.

620
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:38,369
You want to drive one?

621
00:25:38,437 --> 00:25:40,137
I want to race you.

622
00:25:40,188 --> 00:25:43,007
Harvey,
fancy meeting you here.

623
00:25:43,058 --> 00:25:44,225
Cameron,
you keep showing up unannounced,

624
00:25:44,309 --> 00:25:46,227
and I'm not sure why.

625
00:25:46,311 --> 00:25:47,728
I can meet you
anytime, anywhere,

626
00:25:47,813 --> 00:25:49,313
because I'm not afraid
of you.

627
00:25:49,364 --> 00:25:51,148
Well, you should be.

628
00:25:51,199 --> 00:25:52,483
I've got five witnesses

629
00:25:52,534 --> 00:25:54,535
who place the Colonel
that your client bribed

630
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:55,569
at the scene
of those murders.

631
00:25:55,654 --> 00:25:57,989
You want evidence?
Here it is.

632
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,657
See you in court.

633
00:25:59,708 --> 00:26:03,661
We can schedule it
for anytime, anywhere.

634
00:26:06,548 --> 00:26:08,833
You still
don't want my help?

635
00:26:08,884 --> 00:26:12,003
No, I don't.

636
00:26:12,054 --> 00:26:13,087
I don't trust you.

637
00:26:13,171 --> 00:26:14,472
I'm not telling you
to trust me.

638
00:26:14,539 --> 00:26:16,424
I'm telling you
that this is what Darby wants.

639
00:26:16,508 --> 00:26:17,675
Well, Darby isn't here.

640
00:26:24,549 --> 00:26:26,767
Hey, you wanted to talk to me?

641
00:26:26,852 --> 00:26:28,986
Hey, yes.

642
00:26:29,054 --> 00:26:31,355
So I know you don't want me
fighting your battles for you,

643
00:26:31,406 --> 00:26:33,357
and I didn't.
Uhoh.

644
00:26:33,408 --> 00:26:35,826
I just don't want you
to get upset with me.

645
00:26:35,894 --> 00:26:37,411
What?

646
00:26:37,496 --> 00:26:38,779
I went to talk to Donna

647
00:26:38,864 --> 00:26:43,284
about her and me,
and you came up.

648
00:26:43,368 --> 00:26:45,252
What about me?

649
00:26:45,337 --> 00:26:49,957
That it's time for you
to be accepted back.

650
00:26:50,042 --> 00:26:52,793
- That's why she did it.
- Did what?

651
00:26:52,878 --> 00:26:54,712
I caught Katrina
trying to horn in on my case.

652
00:26:54,763 --> 00:26:56,213
- Again?
- Yeah, I know.

653
00:26:56,264 --> 00:26:57,424
Donna walked in
in the middle,

654
00:26:57,432 --> 00:27:00,384
and she took her
to the woodshed.

655
00:27:00,435 --> 00:27:02,053
So you're okay
with what I did?

656
00:27:02,104 --> 00:27:03,771
I'm more than okay.

657
00:27:03,855 --> 00:27:06,307
Not only did Katrina
slink away,

658
00:27:06,391 --> 00:27:07,892
but she came back later
with her tail between her legs,

659
00:27:07,943 --> 00:27:09,643
looking to be my friend.

660
00:27:09,728 --> 00:27:11,762
Well, she is not your friend.

661
00:27:11,813 --> 00:27:13,430
She's definitely not
my friend.

662
00:27:13,482 --> 00:27:16,317
She most certainly isn't.

663
00:27:16,401 --> 00:27:17,818
What are you talking about?

664
00:27:17,903 --> 00:27:19,487
Um...

665
00:27:19,571 --> 00:27:21,906
After I told her that she
could take her friendship

666
00:27:21,957 --> 00:27:23,440
and shove it up her ass,

667
00:27:23,492 --> 00:27:26,794
she said that this whole thing
was about you

668
00:27:26,878 --> 00:27:31,298
and that I was just trying
to protect my girlfriend.

669
00:27:31,383 --> 00:27:32,800
She called me
your girl--girlfriend?

670
00:27:32,884 --> 00:27:33,801
Mmhmm.

671
00:27:33,885 --> 00:27:35,086
And what did you say?

672
00:27:35,137 --> 00:27:37,621
I mean, what--
what could I say?

673
00:27:37,672 --> 00:27:40,758
We're keeping it a secret.
I-I said you weren't.

674
00:27:40,809 --> 00:27:43,728
Good.

675
00:27:43,795 --> 00:27:46,597
Yeah.

676
00:27:49,484 --> 00:27:51,736
Am I?

677
00:27:51,803 --> 00:27:53,354
Don't you know?

678
00:27:53,438 --> 00:27:55,189
Well, we never really
talked about it.

679
00:27:55,273 --> 00:27:56,357
You mean,
I've never really asked.

680
00:27:56,441 --> 00:27:58,359
Nobody asks
anybody anymore.

681
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:06,250
Whoops.

682
00:28:06,317 --> 00:28:09,253
Sorry.
Are you okay?

683
00:28:10,672 --> 00:28:14,792
Rachel Elizabeth Zane,
will you be my girlfriend?

684
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:20,264
Yes.

685
00:28:28,473 --> 00:28:30,057
What the hell is this?

686
00:28:30,142 --> 00:28:31,776
What?

687
00:28:31,843 --> 00:28:33,944
I'm working with Harvey,
my best friend.

688
00:28:34,012 --> 00:28:35,946
Harvey gave birth to me.

689
00:28:36,014 --> 00:28:37,198
When you see me coming,

690
00:28:37,282 --> 00:28:39,533
give me a wide berth,
because I'm a dick.

691
00:28:39,618 --> 00:28:41,202
I'm a dick, dick, dick.

692
00:28:41,286 --> 00:28:43,120
I'm working with Harvey,

693
00:28:43,188 --> 00:28:44,989
my best friend...
Oh, my God.

694
00:28:51,046 --> 00:28:53,297
You're not the fool anymore,
Louis.

695
00:28:53,364 --> 00:28:54,999
Mike Ross is.

696
00:28:55,050 --> 00:28:57,468
And I can't take it back.

697
00:28:57,535 --> 00:28:59,203
I put myself
out on a limb for you,

698
00:28:59,254 --> 00:29:03,974
so if you say no to me,
I won't just be a fool.

699
00:29:04,042 --> 00:29:06,977
I'll be done.

700
00:29:13,318 --> 00:29:14,852
Ugh, this means war.

701
00:29:14,903 --> 00:29:16,353
And I am not taking
any prisoners.

702
00:29:16,404 --> 00:29:18,439
If you think I'm staying
out of it, you're crazy.

703
00:29:18,523 --> 00:29:19,657
I don't want you out of it.
I want you in it.

704
00:29:19,724 --> 00:29:21,525
So what are we gonna do?

705
00:29:21,576 --> 00:29:22,526
Nothing right now.

706
00:29:22,577 --> 00:29:25,830
I need to help Harvey.

707
00:29:30,168 --> 00:29:31,452
I don't believe it.

708
00:29:31,536 --> 00:29:34,121
It's a setback,
but it's going away.

709
00:29:34,206 --> 00:29:37,174
And what exactly
does that mean?

710
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:40,628
I looked into three
of the witnesses,

711
00:29:40,712 --> 00:29:43,464
and all three were affiliated
with a guerilla faction

712
00:29:43,548 --> 00:29:45,349
within the last five years.

713
00:29:45,416 --> 00:29:46,856
We're gonna paint
the entire incident

714
00:29:46,918 --> 00:29:49,854
as a firefight between
the government and armed rebels.

715
00:29:49,921 --> 00:29:51,222
Which, as you pointed out,

716
00:29:51,273 --> 00:29:52,857
is exactly how it was reported
in the first place.

717
00:29:52,924 --> 00:29:55,142
They're still placing
the Colonel at these murders.

718
00:29:55,227 --> 00:29:56,348
I don't think
you understand.

719
00:29:56,361 --> 00:29:57,444
This is what I found
in two hours.

720
00:29:57,529 --> 00:30:00,197
In another day--
I understand perfectly.

721
00:30:00,265 --> 00:30:02,316
You want to tear
these people down in court.

722
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,618
Well, I'm suggesting
they never get there.

723
00:30:04,703 --> 00:30:08,072
We find out how to get to them,
and we pay them off.

724
00:30:08,123 --> 00:30:09,707
Bribery is what got you
into this situation.

725
00:30:09,774 --> 00:30:11,458
Now you think
that's your way out?

726
00:30:11,543 --> 00:30:13,627
That's what you said
when I suggested that with Nick,

727
00:30:13,712 --> 00:30:15,045
and I listened to you.

728
00:30:15,113 --> 00:30:16,747
And I was able to
neutralize him without a payoff.

729
00:30:16,798 --> 00:30:18,159
You were able
to get Cameron Dennis

730
00:30:18,216 --> 00:30:21,418
to offer me a deal that's
now being used against me.

731
00:30:21,469 --> 00:30:24,004
And even if you can
impugn these five witnesses,

732
00:30:24,089 --> 00:30:26,056
your way still
goes to a verdict.

733
00:30:26,124 --> 00:30:27,308
Mine doesn't.

734
00:30:27,392 --> 00:30:28,759
It doesn't
if we don't get caught.

735
00:30:28,810 --> 00:30:29,843
Then don't get caught.

736
00:30:29,928 --> 00:30:31,812
We're not
going to get caught,

737
00:30:31,897 --> 00:30:33,480
because we're not doing this.

738
00:30:33,565 --> 00:30:36,984
You told me you'd do
anything it takes to win.

739
00:30:37,068 --> 00:30:38,652
Remember that?

740
00:30:38,737 --> 00:30:40,417
You'll steal
the rival pitcher's girlfriend

741
00:30:40,471 --> 00:30:41,772
the night
before the big game.

742
00:30:41,823 --> 00:30:43,991
This is the night
before the big game.

743
00:30:44,075 --> 00:30:46,577
Ms. Hessington, what
you're proposing is a crime.

744
00:30:46,644 --> 00:30:50,998
A crime to get me
out of a crime I didn't commit.

745
00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:55,286
You said it doesn't matter
whether you believe me or not.

746
00:30:55,337 --> 00:30:56,787
It doesn't.

747
00:30:56,838 --> 00:30:58,255
But it does,

748
00:30:58,323 --> 00:31:00,591
because if you thought
I was innocent, you'd do this.

749
00:31:00,658 --> 00:31:03,093
I won't.

750
00:31:05,663 --> 00:31:06,880
Then you're fired.

751
00:31:06,965 --> 00:31:10,551
And I'll find
someone who will.

752
00:31:15,598 --> 00:31:16,746
Where did you get
this picture?

753
00:31:16,747 --> 00:31:20,171
- I friended her on Facebook.
- She accepted?

754
00:31:20,172 --> 00:31:21,255
Not as me.

755
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:23,007
I found an intern
at the D.A.'s office

756
00:31:23,058 --> 00:31:24,175
that she worked with
two years ago

757
00:31:24,226 --> 00:31:25,626
who doesn't have
a Facebook account.

758
00:31:25,677 --> 00:31:27,228
Mm. See?

759
00:31:27,312 --> 00:31:29,563
You're not the only one
who can away with fraud.

760
00:31:29,648 --> 00:31:33,050
Okay, step aside.

761
00:31:33,101 --> 00:31:35,269
Aha.

762
00:31:35,354 --> 00:31:36,570
Holy shit.

763
00:31:36,655 --> 00:31:38,555
Yeah, you do not want
to get on my bad side.

764
00:31:38,607 --> 00:31:39,607
I can see that.

765
00:31:39,691 --> 00:31:41,359
What are you working on?

766
00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:43,327
Oh, let me rephrase.

767
00:31:43,395 --> 00:31:46,664
Why the hell aren't you
working on Ava's defense?

768
00:31:49,584 --> 00:31:50,868
Uh, because we got fired.

769
00:31:50,919 --> 00:31:52,670
That's no reason
not to work on her defense.

770
00:31:52,737 --> 00:31:54,121
Look, Harvey,

771
00:31:54,206 --> 00:31:55,840
I know we're just getting back
on the same team and all,

772
00:31:55,907 --> 00:31:57,008
and I don't want
to disagree with you,

773
00:31:57,075 --> 00:31:58,715
but it's actually
a very excellent reason.

774
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:00,011
Wrong.

775
00:32:00,078 --> 00:32:02,246
Odds are Cameron's
expecting her to do this,

776
00:32:02,297 --> 00:32:03,414
and we get a call tomorrow

777
00:32:03,465 --> 00:32:04,715
to get her
out of a new bribery charge.

778
00:32:04,766 --> 00:32:06,750
And then whatever lawyer
she replaces us with

779
00:32:06,802 --> 00:32:08,469
can't stand up
to Cameron in court.

780
00:32:08,553 --> 00:32:09,971
'Cause he's not gonna
stop working on this.

781
00:32:10,055 --> 00:32:11,439
And neither are we.

782
00:32:11,523 --> 00:32:12,940
One more thing.

783
00:32:13,025 --> 00:32:14,725
Don't.
Don't what?

784
00:32:14,776 --> 00:32:15,943
You think I don't know

785
00:32:16,028 --> 00:32:17,695
what you were doing
in there with Rachel?

786
00:32:17,762 --> 00:32:19,780
You saw it too?

787
00:32:19,865 --> 00:32:22,033
I did,
and I need you to let it go.

788
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:24,402
Wait, so you're saying
she threw a punch,

789
00:32:24,453 --> 00:32:26,037
and you don't want me
to throw a punch back?

790
00:32:26,104 --> 00:32:28,406
I'm saying we're
in the middle of a murder trial,

791
00:32:28,457 --> 00:32:31,608
and I need you
to let it go.

792
00:32:35,414 --> 00:32:38,949
Harvey, is there something
you'd like to tell me about Ava?

793
00:32:39,001 --> 00:32:41,252
Yeah, some clients can be
a pain in the ass.

794
00:32:41,303 --> 00:32:42,920
Some ex-clients too.

795
00:32:42,971 --> 00:32:44,755
- Temporary situation.
- Good, good.

796
00:32:44,806 --> 00:32:46,724
'Cause I just wanted to make
sure you were still all over it.

797
00:32:46,791 --> 00:32:48,342
Did you want to make sure
the sun was still shining

798
00:32:48,427 --> 00:32:50,261
and the sky
was still blue?

799
00:32:50,312 --> 00:32:53,297
I'd be humble
after I got fired.

800
00:32:53,348 --> 00:32:55,766
If I ever got fired.

801
00:33:00,305 --> 00:33:03,024
I don't know what it's like
in the D.A.'s office now,

802
00:33:03,108 --> 00:33:04,191
but if I did
what you did

803
00:33:04,276 --> 00:33:06,610
to someone who was with me
in the trenches,

804
00:33:06,661 --> 00:33:08,662
I'd be done,
like you are now.

805
00:33:08,747 --> 00:33:11,916
You have no idea what the
story is between me and Mike.

806
00:33:11,983 --> 00:33:13,200
I don't care
what the story is.

807
00:33:13,285 --> 00:33:15,986
You hired me,
and then you hung me out to dry.

808
00:33:16,038 --> 00:33:18,089
You don't give me cases.
You don't give me a word.

809
00:33:18,156 --> 00:33:19,290
What am I supposed to do?

810
00:33:19,341 --> 00:33:21,158
We both know
how you got here.

811
00:33:21,209 --> 00:33:24,295
You expect more from me?
That's not my problem.

812
00:33:24,346 --> 00:33:25,629
I do know how I got here,

813
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:28,832
which is how I know
you're not gonna fire me.

814
00:33:28,884 --> 00:33:30,851
So keep your empty threats
to yourself.

815
00:33:30,936 --> 00:33:33,054
When I said, "you're done,"

816
00:33:33,138 --> 00:33:35,506
I meant your future
at this firm is over,

817
00:33:35,557 --> 00:33:37,024
because you will
never be anything

818
00:33:37,109 --> 00:33:39,610
more than you are
right now.

819
00:33:39,677 --> 00:33:43,481
And if you ever do
anything like that

820
00:33:43,532 --> 00:33:45,282
to Mike Ross again,

821
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:47,234
I don't give a shit
what our deal was.

822
00:33:47,319 --> 00:33:50,237
You'll be gone.

823
00:33:57,045 --> 00:33:58,362
Hey.

824
00:33:58,413 --> 00:34:00,498
Remember that thing
we were gonna do to Katrina?

825
00:34:00,549 --> 00:34:01,882
We don't need
to do it anymore.

826
00:34:01,967 --> 00:34:03,967
- What are you talking about?
- Harvey just did it.

827
00:34:03,969 --> 00:34:05,586
He went to talk to her?

828
00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:07,805
He laid her out.

829
00:34:07,872 --> 00:34:12,393
Yeah, you don't want to be
on his bad side either.

830
00:34:12,477 --> 00:34:13,561
You know, we could still
send her that thing.

831
00:34:13,645 --> 00:34:14,678
Really?

832
00:34:14,729 --> 00:34:16,347
No, actually,
Harvey told me not to.

833
00:34:16,398 --> 00:34:17,565
So?
He's not so tough.

834
00:34:17,649 --> 00:34:18,599
Yeah,
but we could take him.

835
00:34:18,683 --> 00:34:19,650
What's he gonna do?

836
00:34:19,717 --> 00:34:22,186
Talk to us with his words?

837
00:34:22,237 --> 00:34:23,320
Wag a finger at us.

838
00:34:23,388 --> 00:34:24,488
Maybe give us a time-out.

839
00:34:24,556 --> 00:34:26,657
Maybe even slap us
with a lawsuit.

840
00:34:30,579 --> 00:34:33,030
High five.

841
00:34:33,081 --> 00:34:35,332
- Okay.
- Okay.

842
00:34:37,402 --> 00:34:38,842
We don't need to bribe
the witnesses.

843
00:34:38,870 --> 00:34:40,371
We need them to sue us,
right?

844
00:34:40,422 --> 00:34:42,623
The alien tort statute
allows foreign nationals

845
00:34:42,707 --> 00:34:44,208
to bring civil claims
in U.S. court.

846
00:34:44,259 --> 00:34:45,543
And then we settle.

847
00:34:45,594 --> 00:34:47,178
Might be a payoff,
but it's a legal payoff.

848
00:34:47,245 --> 00:34:48,912
And the witnesses
aren't Americans,

849
00:34:48,964 --> 00:34:50,181
so Cameron
can't subpoena them.

850
00:34:50,248 --> 00:34:51,415
Exactly.

851
00:34:51,466 --> 00:34:52,749
Good, but they need
a legitimate claim,

852
00:34:52,801 --> 00:34:54,852
or we could be on the hook
for bribery ourselves.

853
00:34:54,919 --> 00:34:56,053
What are they suing us for?

854
00:34:56,104 --> 00:34:57,665
Harvey, they witnessed
multiple murders.

855
00:34:57,722 --> 00:34:59,440
That would be
emotionally distressing.

856
00:34:59,524 --> 00:35:01,058
Might even
suffer from P.T.S.D.

857
00:35:01,109 --> 00:35:02,643
Which would prevent them
from getting on the plane

858
00:35:02,727 --> 00:35:04,111
and testifying
in our case.

859
00:35:04,196 --> 00:35:05,563
Get it going.

860
00:35:05,614 --> 00:35:07,398
You got a lawyer
to take the other side?

861
00:35:07,449 --> 00:35:08,765
I have someone in mind,

862
00:35:08,817 --> 00:35:10,568
but we need a way to get
those witnesses to go for it.

863
00:35:10,619 --> 00:35:12,936
No, right now our problem
isn't getting them to go for it.

864
00:35:12,988 --> 00:35:15,656
It's getting to Ava before she
gets someone to bribe them.

865
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:17,041
Hey, Harvey.

866
00:35:17,108 --> 00:35:20,744
I heard about what you did
with Katrina.

867
00:35:20,795 --> 00:35:23,881
I know I asked you not to,
and I wasn't going to,

868
00:35:23,948 --> 00:35:26,000
but I saw her,
and I couldn't help it.

869
00:35:26,084 --> 00:35:27,051
I get it.

870
00:35:27,118 --> 00:35:28,452
She brings that out
in people,

871
00:35:28,503 --> 00:35:32,423
but listen,
just don't let it happen again.

872
00:35:34,676 --> 00:35:37,728
Son of a bitch.

873
00:36:04,684 --> 00:36:06,885
I'd call you
a lying son of a bitch,

874
00:36:06,936 --> 00:36:08,937
but you were
true to your word.

875
00:36:09,021 --> 00:36:11,273
- Yeah, what word's that?
- You're not like me.

876
00:36:11,357 --> 00:36:13,058
I didn't hijack
your client, Harvey.

877
00:36:13,109 --> 00:36:14,976
Oh, no, you waited
for her to fire me,

878
00:36:15,061 --> 00:36:17,062
and then you swooped in
with an illegal fix.

879
00:36:17,113 --> 00:36:18,280
You're wrong.

880
00:36:18,364 --> 00:36:19,814
You gonna look me in the eye
and tell me

881
00:36:19,899 --> 00:36:22,259
you didn't just meet with her
about bribing those witnesses?

882
00:36:22,268 --> 00:36:24,069
That's exactly
what I met with her about.

883
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:26,121
She asked me if I was willing,
and I said I was.

884
00:36:26,205 --> 00:36:29,908
I also told her that
in this particular situation,

885
00:36:29,959 --> 00:36:32,577
it'd be counterproductive.

886
00:36:32,628 --> 00:36:34,329
You looked
into Cameron Dennis.

887
00:36:34,413 --> 00:36:37,082
She bribes those witnesses,
he'll be lying in wait.

888
00:36:37,133 --> 00:36:38,500
And that's what
you told her?

889
00:36:38,584 --> 00:36:39,918
Yeah, amongst other things.

890
00:36:39,969 --> 00:36:42,003
You told her
to stick with the lawyer

891
00:36:42,088 --> 00:36:43,305
she picked
in the first place?

892
00:36:43,389 --> 00:36:46,558
More or less.

893
00:36:46,625 --> 00:36:47,976
Harvey, listen,
I told you,

894
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:50,178
you don't have
to trust me, okay?

895
00:36:50,263 --> 00:36:51,813
But Darby does.

896
00:36:51,898 --> 00:36:53,181
And Darby wants this win.

897
00:36:53,266 --> 00:36:54,849
Therefore, so do I.

898
00:36:54,934 --> 00:36:57,269
I'm guessing you think
that means that I owe you.

899
00:36:57,320 --> 00:37:00,572
No, I think it means
you're gonna pay me.

900
00:37:06,696 --> 00:37:08,146
You look happy.

901
00:37:08,197 --> 00:37:09,698
Dodged a bullet.

902
00:37:09,782 --> 00:37:11,082
You got Ava back.

903
00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:13,835
Stephen got Ava back.
Turns out he's here to help.

904
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,453
And you believe that?

905
00:37:15,504 --> 00:37:17,706
He got Ava back.

906
00:37:17,790 --> 00:37:20,425
Mike's on his way over there
as we speak.

907
00:37:20,492 --> 00:37:21,426
Mike?

908
00:37:21,493 --> 00:37:22,544
He made the call.

909
00:37:22,628 --> 00:37:24,095
Why not let him
score the touchdown?

910
00:37:24,163 --> 00:37:26,715
And you must have
someplace else to be.

911
00:37:26,799 --> 00:37:28,099
Blonde or brunette?

912
00:37:28,167 --> 00:37:29,100
Neither.

913
00:37:29,168 --> 00:37:31,937
I have to go repay a debt.

914
00:37:33,806 --> 00:37:37,609
So once this is all
taken care of, I wire the money.

915
00:37:37,676 --> 00:37:42,147
And Cameron's witnesses
never take the stand.

916
00:37:42,198 --> 00:37:45,066
Harvey told me
this maneuver was your idea.

917
00:37:45,151 --> 00:37:48,987
I'm not one to take credit,
but, yes, it was.

918
00:37:49,038 --> 00:37:51,122
He trusts you,
doesn't he?

919
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:52,523
I like to think so.

920
00:37:52,575 --> 00:37:54,542
So you know
how he thinks?

921
00:37:54,627 --> 00:37:56,044
What I know
about how Harvey thinks

922
00:37:56,128 --> 00:37:58,580
is that you can never be sure
what Harvey's gonna think.

923
00:37:58,664 --> 00:38:00,465
What do you think
he thinks?

924
00:38:00,533 --> 00:38:04,419
I think
that he's not really interested

925
00:38:04,503 --> 00:38:06,054
in whether
you did it or not.

926
00:38:06,138 --> 00:38:08,206
He's interested
in what the evidence is

927
00:38:08,257 --> 00:38:09,874
and what we can
make it say.

928
00:38:09,925 --> 00:38:11,142
I want to know.

929
00:38:11,210 --> 00:38:14,729
- Then you should ask him.
- I'm asking you.

930
00:38:18,067 --> 00:38:19,651
I have no idea
whether Harvey thinks

931
00:38:19,718 --> 00:38:22,821
you had those people
murdered or not,

932
00:38:22,888 --> 00:38:25,323
but even if I did,
I would never say anything

933
00:38:25,391 --> 00:38:28,910
because he wouldn't
want me to.

934
00:38:28,995 --> 00:38:30,362
He's picked
a good number two.

935
00:38:30,413 --> 00:38:33,114
I like to think so.

936
00:38:33,199 --> 00:38:35,166
What do you think?

937
00:38:39,121 --> 00:38:40,571
I think it's my job
to represent you

938
00:38:40,623 --> 00:38:42,757
to the best
of my ability.

939
00:38:42,842 --> 00:38:44,959
To say anything else would be
as big a betrayal to Harvey

940
00:38:45,044 --> 00:38:47,962
as discussing
what he thinks.

941
00:39:09,201 --> 00:39:11,453
Let me guess,
you won the Testosterone 500,

942
00:39:11,537 --> 00:39:12,654
and you're here to brag.

943
00:39:12,738 --> 00:39:15,273
Actually,
Harvey took the checkered flag,

944
00:39:15,324 --> 00:39:16,574
and I'm here for you.

945
00:39:16,625 --> 00:39:18,710
Why would I go out
with a loser?

946
00:39:18,777 --> 00:39:20,295
Well, losing
has its benefits.

947
00:39:20,379 --> 00:39:21,663
If he thinks
he's a better man than me,

948
00:39:21,747 --> 00:39:23,798
then he won't get jealous.

949
00:39:23,883 --> 00:39:25,523
Oh, Harvey's got
nothing to be jealous of.

950
00:39:25,551 --> 00:39:26,634
Not yet.

951
00:39:26,719 --> 00:39:30,755
He will be
if you take a ride with me.

952
00:39:30,806 --> 00:39:32,557
That could be dangerous.

953
00:39:32,624 --> 00:39:35,393
Yeah.

954
00:39:35,461 --> 00:39:36,461
Look,
if you think

955
00:39:36,512 --> 00:39:38,229
a fancy car
and some smooth talk

956
00:39:38,297 --> 00:39:40,098
is all it takes
to get to me...

957
00:39:43,652 --> 00:39:46,604
Okay, I understand.

958
00:39:46,655 --> 00:39:48,573
I'm sure I can find another
connoisseur of the theater

959
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:49,657
to take to <i>MacBeth.</i>

960
00:39:49,742 --> 00:39:51,326
Oh, your research
came up short.

961
00:39:51,410 --> 00:39:52,610
I've already seen <i>MacBeth.</i>

962
00:39:52,661 --> 00:39:55,146
Not with me,
not in the front row,

963
00:39:55,197 --> 00:39:58,950
and certainly
not with Daniel Day-Lewis.

964
00:40:05,157 --> 00:40:06,341
I'm in trouble.

965
00:40:12,798 --> 00:40:15,183
This is everything
I have on Tony Gianopolous.

966
00:40:15,267 --> 00:40:19,471
Read it, summarize it,
and make it your life.

967
00:40:19,522 --> 00:40:20,889
I won't let you down.

968
00:40:20,973 --> 00:40:24,008
Welcome to team Litt.

969
00:40:25,177 --> 00:40:28,563
Louis.

970
00:40:28,647 --> 00:40:30,732
Thank you.

971
00:40:41,744 --> 00:40:44,295
Here it is.
Fully executed settlement.

972
00:40:44,363 --> 00:40:47,715
Signed, sealed, delivered.

973
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,551
Who'd you get
to represent the other side?

974
00:40:49,635 --> 00:40:50,919
Harold Gunderson.

975
00:40:51,003 --> 00:40:53,221
Louis' whipping boy?

976
00:40:53,305 --> 00:40:55,206
Yeah, he works
for Allison Holt now,

977
00:40:55,257 --> 00:40:56,424
which is actually
kind of perfect,

978
00:40:56,509 --> 00:40:57,475
'cause everyone
knows she would

979
00:40:57,543 --> 00:40:58,760
never do anything
to help us.

980
00:40:58,844 --> 00:41:01,229
But I got Harold the job,
so--

981
00:41:01,313 --> 00:41:02,764
He owes you one.

982
00:41:02,848 --> 00:41:05,266
Not anymore.

983
00:41:06,986 --> 00:41:09,320
What'd you say?

984
00:41:09,388 --> 00:41:11,022
What?

985
00:41:11,073 --> 00:41:12,774
When Ava asked
if I thought she was guilty.

986
00:41:12,858 --> 00:41:15,276
I told her that I had no idea
what you thought

987
00:41:15,361 --> 00:41:19,247
and it was none of her business
what I thought.

988
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:24,502
Good answer.

989
00:41:29,842 --> 00:41:32,210
What about you?

990
00:41:32,261 --> 00:41:33,545
You want to know
what I think?

991
00:41:33,596 --> 00:41:38,099
I know what you think,
and I think it too.

992
00:41:38,184 --> 00:41:40,418
She did it.

993
00:41:46,308 --> 00:41:50,195
We, uh...
We never had drinks before.

994
00:41:50,262 --> 00:41:52,280
I know.

995
00:41:52,364 --> 00:41:54,365
Harvey,
we just admitted to each other

996
00:41:54,433 --> 00:41:57,235
that we're defending
a murderer.

997
00:41:57,286 --> 00:41:59,621
Doesn't really seem like
cause for celebration.

998
00:41:59,705 --> 00:42:02,490
It's not a celebration.

999
00:42:02,575 --> 00:42:05,877
Remember when you said
Butch and Sundance were back?

1000
00:42:05,944 --> 00:42:09,163
They weren't.

1001
00:42:09,248 --> 00:42:10,965
What do you mean?

1002
00:42:11,050 --> 00:42:13,218
I mean
it's time I told you

1003
00:42:13,285 --> 00:42:16,754
I made a deal with Darby to
take over the firm from Jessica.
