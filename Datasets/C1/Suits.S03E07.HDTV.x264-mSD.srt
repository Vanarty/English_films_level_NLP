1
00:00:00,052 --> 00:00:01,352
Previously on
<i>Suits...</i>

2
00:00:01,485 --> 00:00:02,925
It's going up
on the wall tomorrow...

3
00:00:03,011 --> 00:00:05,135
And this is your way
of getting me on your side.

4
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:07,160
I don't want you
on my side.

5
00:00:08,143 --> 00:00:09,673
I want us to be
on the same side.

6
00:00:10,036 --> 00:00:11,868
I get
Ava Hessington acquitted.

7
00:00:11,941 --> 00:00:14,007
Darby backs me
for managing partner.

8
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,911
I'm here to tell you
I don't want it anymore.

9
00:00:15,975 --> 00:00:17,541
Get out of my sight.

10
00:00:17,613 --> 00:00:19,306
Let me spell it out
for you, okay?

11
00:00:19,379 --> 00:00:21,778
You don't work my case
without me.

12
00:00:21,843 --> 00:00:23,182
And since you seem to be
having trouble

13
00:00:23,247 --> 00:00:25,488
understanding that,
you don't work my case at all.

14
00:00:25,553 --> 00:00:27,393
You and Stephen.

15
00:00:27,458 --> 00:00:28,521
It bothers me.

16
00:00:28,593 --> 00:00:29,824
I didn't know
you're a cat man.

17
00:00:29,896 --> 00:00:31,325
Do I have brains
in my head?

18
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:32,550
Do I have a heart
in my chest?

19
00:00:32,588 --> 00:00:34,288
Who is this stunning creature?
Mikado.

20
00:00:34,353 --> 00:00:35,954
The Hong Kong office
urgently requires me

21
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,223
for a few weeks.

22
00:00:37,288 --> 00:00:40,125
I'm sure there is a suitable
luxury feline hotel.

23
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:42,324
- Don't play games, okay?
- So you'll do it?

24
00:00:42,397 --> 00:00:43,891
Nyes.
Can I have her?

25
00:00:43,962 --> 00:00:45,856
What do you want, Stephen?

26
00:00:45,928 --> 00:00:47,692
I heard Cameron
got a witness.

27
00:00:47,757 --> 00:00:49,857
He did?
What do you want?

28
00:00:49,922 --> 00:00:50,857
I'm just checking to see
if there's anything

29
00:00:50,922 --> 00:00:51,857
I can do to help.

30
00:00:51,922 --> 00:00:53,593
- There isn't.
- No way.

31
00:00:53,658 --> 00:00:55,161
If you didn't have
Mariga yesterday,

32
00:00:55,226 --> 00:00:56,433
you don't have him today.

33
00:00:56,498 --> 00:00:59,062
Why don't you ask your friend
Stephen Huntley?

34
00:00:59,127 --> 00:01:01,295
He's the one who led me
right to him.

35
00:01:09,746 --> 00:01:11,466
You know, you might just be
the perfect man.

36
00:01:11,511 --> 00:01:13,139
You're just coming
to realize that now?

37
00:01:13,204 --> 00:01:16,140
Mmhmm.

38
00:01:22,945 --> 00:01:24,214
Donna.

39
00:01:24,279 --> 00:01:26,718
I need a minute alone
with Stephen.

40
00:01:26,783 --> 00:01:29,121
Is it just a minute?
Or do I need to get a cab?

41
00:01:29,186 --> 00:01:33,123
It won't take long.
But the rest is up to you.

42
00:01:38,758 --> 00:01:41,039
Well, I'm guessing you're not
here to join us for dessert.

43
00:01:41,096 --> 00:01:44,768
You called Colonel Mariga.

44
00:01:44,833 --> 00:01:47,870
Yeah.
I called him.

45
00:01:47,934 --> 00:01:50,100
Called him to find out what
Cameron Dennis had offered him

46
00:01:50,172 --> 00:01:52,636
and to suggest
that he could do better.

47
00:01:52,709 --> 00:01:54,940
You mean you called him
to offer him a bribe.

48
00:01:55,013 --> 00:01:56,740
Doesn't matter.

49
00:01:56,813 --> 00:01:57,813
Dennis was bluffing.

50
00:01:57,878 --> 00:01:59,045
He never had him
in the first place.

51
00:01:59,118 --> 00:02:01,948
He didn't
but he does now

52
00:02:02,013 --> 00:02:04,348
because of you.

53
00:02:04,421 --> 00:02:06,388
You're saying
he traced my call?

54
00:02:06,453 --> 00:02:07,652
You're damn right I am.

55
00:02:07,725 --> 00:02:09,493
And you're angry with <i>me?</i>

56
00:02:09,558 --> 00:02:11,198
You're supposed to be
looking out for Ava.

57
00:02:11,262 --> 00:02:12,630
If I didn't know any better,
I'd think

58
00:02:12,695 --> 00:02:14,296
that you were working
for Cameron Dennis.

59
00:02:14,335 --> 00:02:17,102
And by the way,
the man is in hiding.

60
00:02:17,167 --> 00:02:19,333
His own country can't find him.
How the hell did you?

61
00:02:19,398 --> 00:02:20,669
Same way you would.

62
00:02:20,734 --> 00:02:22,740
You know people here.

63
00:02:22,805 --> 00:02:23,939
I know people everywhere.

64
00:02:24,004 --> 00:02:26,140
Well, calling those people
just screwed us.

65
00:02:26,205 --> 00:02:28,708
I called them, Harvey,
because you were doing nothing.

66
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:31,548
I was doing nothing
because he had nothing.

67
00:02:31,613 --> 00:02:33,043
And then I had the tape
thrown out

68
00:02:33,116 --> 00:02:34,548
and he had less than nothing.

69
00:02:34,613 --> 00:02:37,020
Then he threw a hail Mary
and you just caught it.

70
00:02:37,085 --> 00:02:39,450
If he found Mariga
by tapping my phones,

71
00:02:39,523 --> 00:02:40,984
the judge
will throw him out.

72
00:02:41,049 --> 00:02:41,983
You think we're gonna be able
to prove

73
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:43,086
that that's how
he found him?

74
00:02:43,151 --> 00:02:44,349
You wanna carry on
yelling at me?

75
00:02:44,422 --> 00:02:45,991
Or should we fix this?

76
00:02:46,056 --> 00:02:47,056
You know, I have had
about enough

77
00:02:47,121 --> 00:02:48,288
of your fixer crap, okay?

78
00:02:48,361 --> 00:02:50,792
You didn't fix shit.
You broke it wide open.

79
00:02:50,865 --> 00:02:52,389
Then what the hell
are you doing here?

80
00:02:52,462 --> 00:02:54,322
I'm here to tell you
that if I hear your name

81
00:02:54,395 --> 00:02:55,361
around my case again,

82
00:02:55,426 --> 00:03:00,196
I am gonna beat the shit
outta you.

83
00:03:04,471 --> 00:03:06,436
You told him you were gonna
beat the shit out of him?

84
00:03:06,509 --> 00:03:08,075
Yeah, and that's
the last time

85
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:09,444
I'm gonna tell him anything.

86
00:03:09,509 --> 00:03:11,275
What?

87
00:03:11,347 --> 00:03:12,714
You think I wouldn't
do it?

88
00:03:12,779 --> 00:03:14,409
No, I'm not sure
you <i>could</i> do it.

89
00:03:14,482 --> 00:03:15,945
What's he going
to hit me with, his ascot?

90
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:18,450
Harvey, the man plays rugby.
That's no joke.

91
00:03:18,515 --> 00:03:19,819
How do you even
know that?

92
00:03:19,884 --> 00:03:21,587
It's on the Darby
international website.

93
00:03:21,652 --> 00:03:23,353
I don't give you
enough work.

94
00:03:23,418 --> 00:03:24,920
And I'm gonna change that
right now.

95
00:03:24,985 --> 00:03:27,854
Cameron's not denying us access
to Mariga,

96
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:30,189
which means he's gonna sing
any song Cameron wants

97
00:03:30,254 --> 00:03:31,294
to avoid a firing squad--

98
00:03:31,359 --> 00:03:32,696
So I need to find anything
I can

99
00:03:32,761 --> 00:03:34,463
to take Mariga apart.

100
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:35,599
What the hell is this?

101
00:03:35,664 --> 00:03:36,800
I'll tell you what it is.

102
00:03:36,865 --> 00:03:39,031
It's a witness list
from Cameron Dennis

103
00:03:39,104 --> 00:03:40,366
with Colonel Mariga on it.

104
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:41,733
And he's giving us access,

105
00:03:41,806 --> 00:03:43,269
which means he's not bluffing.

106
00:03:43,334 --> 00:03:44,373
I know.

107
00:03:44,438 --> 00:03:45,470
You told me
he didn't have him.

108
00:03:45,543 --> 00:03:46,543
He didn't.

109
00:03:46,608 --> 00:03:47,808
Then how the hell
did he get him?

110
00:03:47,881 --> 00:03:50,481
Stephen.
He was trying to fix it.

111
00:03:50,546 --> 00:03:52,713
Are you telling me
you let Stephen Huntley

112
00:03:52,786 --> 00:03:54,889
lead Cameron directly
to the star witness?

113
00:03:54,953 --> 00:03:56,184
I didn't let Stephen
do shit.

114
00:03:56,257 --> 00:03:58,552
He did it on his own.
He's your guy.

115
00:03:58,625 --> 00:04:00,088
You aligned with him.
I did not.

116
00:04:00,161 --> 00:04:01,655
Okay, he's Edward Darby's guy.

117
00:04:01,728 --> 00:04:03,094
You made a deal
with Darby.

118
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:07,957
That makes him your guy.

119
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:09,596
You really wanna do this
right now?

120
00:04:09,661 --> 00:04:13,463
Are you telling me
he doesn't know?

121
00:04:13,528 --> 00:04:16,002
You know I know.

122
00:04:16,067 --> 00:04:18,404
You and I had
this conversation once.

123
00:04:18,469 --> 00:04:21,232
And you know
where my loyalties lie.

124
00:04:21,305 --> 00:04:24,037
And as for your point,
Stephen is only here at all

125
00:04:24,102 --> 00:04:26,706
because you made a deal
with Darby in the first place.

126
00:04:26,771 --> 00:04:31,248
And I told you,
I don't want mine anymore.

127
00:04:31,313 --> 00:04:32,816
Then I guess
I'm still in charge.

128
00:04:32,881 --> 00:04:35,416
And since I've now been drafted
onto this case,

129
00:04:35,481 --> 00:04:38,320
no one tells Edward Darby

130
00:04:38,385 --> 00:04:40,489
or Stephen Huntley
a goddamn thing.

131
00:04:40,554 --> 00:04:45,103

What'd you get me?

143
00:05:32,209 --> 00:05:33,649
This isn't the first time
Mariga lied

144
00:05:33,718 --> 00:05:34,389
to get out of prosecution.

145
00:05:34,454 --> 00:05:35,484
Other murders?

146
00:05:35,557 --> 00:05:38,292
Murder. Extortion.
Embezzlement.

147
00:05:38,357 --> 00:05:39,587
You want someone
to commit a crime

148
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:41,387
and blame it on someone else,
he's your guy.

149
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:43,091
You got the questions
lined up?

150
00:05:43,156 --> 00:05:44,563
Right here.

151
00:05:44,628 --> 00:05:49,163
But I think you know
what my biggest question is.

152
00:05:49,236 --> 00:05:50,403
What do you want me
to say?

153
00:05:50,468 --> 00:05:52,638
I changed my mind about Darby.
I told Jessica.

154
00:05:52,704 --> 00:05:53,974
And I didn't get a chance
to tell you

155
00:05:54,039 --> 00:05:55,406
because we had bigger fish
to fry.

156
00:05:55,479 --> 00:05:57,310
I understand why you didn't
get a chance to tell me.

157
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:58,974
What I don't get is
why you told her.

158
00:05:59,047 --> 00:06:01,781
If I can't trust her
to get over it after I tell her,

159
00:06:01,846 --> 00:06:04,516
I might as well have stuck
with Darby in the first place.

160
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:06,148
Doesn't look like
she's over it.

161
00:06:06,221 --> 00:06:07,917
Because she knows
what we know.

162
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:11,852
Right now,
we got bigger fish to fry.

163
00:06:23,733 --> 00:06:27,971
Are you kidding me?

164
00:06:28,036 --> 00:06:29,172
Norma?

165
00:06:29,237 --> 00:06:30,846
I've told you a million
goddamn times.

166
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:32,383
2% of Mikado's afternoon milk.

167
00:06:32,448 --> 00:06:33,728
She's gonna taste
the extra skim.

168
00:06:33,785 --> 00:06:35,520
And who do you think
she's gonna take it out on?

169
00:06:35,585 --> 00:06:37,449
Me.

170
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:38,586
Oh, and find out
what the holdup is

171
00:06:38,659 --> 00:06:40,156
on my trademark claim
on "Litt Up."

172
00:06:40,228 --> 00:06:42,094
Nigel, you're back a week early.

173
00:06:42,167 --> 00:06:43,663
I was gonna holiday
an extra week.

174
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:45,800
But I was rejuvenated
after only two days

175
00:06:45,873 --> 00:06:48,737
in the native clays
at Guangzhou.

176
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:50,042
You're glowing.

177
00:06:50,107 --> 00:06:53,013
And I can't wait
to see Mikado.

178
00:06:53,078 --> 00:06:54,752
The lovely lass is here,
I see.

179
00:06:54,818 --> 00:06:57,121
Uh, no, she's not here.

180
00:06:57,186 --> 00:07:01,057
Then who's that for?

181
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:03,361
That's for me.

182
00:07:03,426 --> 00:07:06,035
It's my afternoon milk.

183
00:07:13,973 --> 00:07:16,784
Hits the spot.
Gotta run.

184
00:07:16,849 --> 00:07:18,480
Louis.

185
00:07:18,553 --> 00:07:20,583
Where is she?

186
00:07:20,656 --> 00:07:22,254
At the best cat spa
in the city,

187
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,054
getting her nails buffed
and her paws polished.

188
00:07:24,119 --> 00:07:25,687
You spoil her.

189
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,895
- She spoils me.
- Call me when she's back.

190
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,896
I will.

191
00:07:34,735 --> 00:07:37,670
Rachel, Louis.
Code Red.

192
00:08:02,501 --> 00:08:03,637
Did anybody see you
leave my office?

193
00:08:03,702 --> 00:08:04,765
- Norma gave me a look.
- She's on our side.

194
00:08:04,838 --> 00:08:06,069
Rachel, concentrate.

195
00:08:06,134 --> 00:08:07,341
I don't even know
if I'm on your side.

196
00:08:07,406 --> 00:08:09,574
This isn't right.
She wants to be my cat.

197
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:10,806
No.
You want her to be your cat.

198
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:12,310
You don't understand.

199
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:13,984
This past week has been the best
week of my life, ever since--

200
00:08:14,049 --> 00:08:15,153
Bruno, I understand.

201
00:08:15,218 --> 00:08:16,987
But you can't keep Mikado.

202
00:08:17,052 --> 00:08:18,292
She's Nigel's cat.

203
00:08:18,357 --> 00:08:21,725
- Well said.
- Ah, Nigel, how did you--

204
00:08:21,798 --> 00:08:23,230
By doing what any
self-respecting cat owner

205
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:26,336
would do:
Equipping her with an RFID.

206
00:08:26,401 --> 00:08:28,809
A radio-frequency-identifier
integrated circuit.

207
00:08:28,874 --> 00:08:31,137
Why would you hide
my prize possession?

208
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:33,873
Is that what she is to you?
A possession?

209
00:08:33,946 --> 00:08:37,881
What she is to me
is between me and her.

210
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:43,055
You're right.

211
00:08:43,128 --> 00:08:46,599
He's right.

212
00:08:46,664 --> 00:08:50,169
I'm sorry.

213
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:54,308
I'm not ready.
Louis.

214
00:08:54,373 --> 00:08:55,783
He was supposed to be gone
for two weeks.

215
00:08:55,848 --> 00:08:58,208
We had a verbal contract I would
have custody for two weeks.

216
00:08:58,216 --> 00:08:59,951
It was
a baby-sitting arrangement.

217
00:09:00,016 --> 00:09:01,055
One that I was
mentally, emotionally,

218
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,241
and physically prepared for.

219
00:09:02,256 --> 00:09:03,736
And accordingly,
I am legally entitled

220
00:09:03,755 --> 00:09:05,194
to Mikado
for one more week.

221
00:09:05,259 --> 00:09:07,625
That is not the law.

222
00:09:07,698 --> 00:09:09,726
There's actually precedent.

223
00:09:09,791 --> 00:09:13,599
Warminsky v. Mitchell, 1974.

224
00:09:15,034 --> 00:09:16,601
I have a meeting,

225
00:09:16,673 --> 00:09:20,605
after which I will collect
what is rightfully mine.

226
00:09:27,053 --> 00:09:28,547
- That was genius.
- No, Louis.

227
00:09:28,619 --> 00:09:30,385
That was a stall

228
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:32,216
because the truth is
Nigel's right.

229
00:09:32,289 --> 00:09:35,260
She's not your cat.

230
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:37,765
You've gotta let her go.

231
00:09:39,663 --> 00:09:40,862
Hey, do you wanna talk
about last night?

232
00:09:40,935 --> 00:09:42,302
No, Donna, I don't.

233
00:09:42,367 --> 00:09:44,533
Harvey, you said my being
with Stephen bothered you.

234
00:09:44,606 --> 00:09:45,886
And I just wanna
make sure that--

235
00:09:45,933 --> 00:09:48,973
That what he did deserved
interrupting your date?

236
00:09:49,038 --> 00:09:49,973
- Did it?
- I don't know, Donna.

237
00:09:50,038 --> 00:09:51,141
You tell me.

238
00:09:51,206 --> 00:09:52,971
I mean, we had this entire case
locked up.

239
00:09:53,044 --> 00:09:54,677
I mean, your boyfriend
gave Cameron

240
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:56,413
a Get-Out-Of-Jail-Free card

241
00:09:56,478 --> 00:09:58,246
after I told him to stay
the hell out of it.

242
00:09:58,319 --> 00:09:59,254
What'd he do?

243
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,720
He tracked down Mariga

244
00:10:00,785 --> 00:10:02,025
and led Cameron
right to him.

245
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:03,362
- Harvey, I'm--
- You know what?

246
00:10:03,427 --> 00:10:05,425
Instead of discussing Stephen
shit-ing the bed,

247
00:10:05,498 --> 00:10:08,528
right now,
I have to try to clean it up.

248
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:16,647
Gwambaa.

249
00:10:16,712 --> 00:10:18,709
Makaiwa.

250
00:10:18,774 --> 00:10:20,244
Port Eefa.

251
00:10:20,309 --> 00:10:21,612
40 people killed.

252
00:10:21,676 --> 00:10:24,515
Are you here to answer
questions or ask them?

253
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:25,947
Are you familiar
with these photos?

254
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:27,619
I'm responsible
for these photos.

255
00:10:27,683 --> 00:10:28,880
You seem proud of yourself.

256
00:10:28,953 --> 00:10:31,486
I am a military man
in a violent country.

257
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:33,718
I do what needs to be done.

258
00:10:33,783 --> 00:10:35,192
That doesn't make me
a murderer.

259
00:10:35,257 --> 00:10:36,690
Because you kill people

260
00:10:36,763 --> 00:10:37,961
under orders
from your government.

261
00:10:38,026 --> 00:10:39,024
Precisely.

262
00:10:39,097 --> 00:10:40,063
Isn't that exactly
what you did

263
00:10:40,128 --> 00:10:41,493
on Hessington Oil's land?

264
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:43,293
No, I killed those people

265
00:10:43,358 --> 00:10:45,334
because I was paid
by your client.

266
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:46,863
Well, that <i>does</i> make you
a murderer.

267
00:10:46,936 --> 00:10:48,870
And you're only saying
that Ava knew about it

268
00:10:48,936 --> 00:10:50,534
because your precious government

269
00:10:50,607 --> 00:10:52,730
is no longer in power
to protect you.

270
00:10:52,802 --> 00:10:53,968
That is not true.

271
00:10:54,033 --> 00:10:55,432
And what exactly is
the penalty

272
00:10:55,505 --> 00:10:57,568
if you're found guilty of murder
in your country?

273
00:10:57,642 --> 00:10:58,937
Death.

274
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:01,209
And why is it you haven't
been sent back there?

275
00:11:01,274 --> 00:11:03,480
I'll take this one.
He cut a deal with me.

276
00:11:03,545 --> 00:11:05,711
Because I care more about
the person who ordered this

277
00:11:05,776 --> 00:11:07,048
than the person
who carried it out.

278
00:11:07,113 --> 00:11:08,113
There's only one problem.

279
00:11:08,114 --> 00:11:09,955
He only met with Ava once.

280
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:12,691
And your only proof
of that meeting is inadmissible.

281
00:11:12,756 --> 00:11:13,986
Wrong.

282
00:11:14,059 --> 00:11:17,160
He didn't only talk
to Ava once.

283
00:11:17,225 --> 00:11:19,296
I told your client
about what needed to be done

284
00:11:19,361 --> 00:11:22,696
when we spoke
on the phone.

285
00:11:22,762 --> 00:11:24,497
Ah.

286
00:11:25,803 --> 00:11:28,067
Ms. Hessington didn't tell you
about that.

287
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:30,206
She didn't tell us about that
because that never happened.

288
00:11:30,279 --> 00:11:31,360
What'd you expect her
to do?

289
00:11:31,415 --> 00:11:33,615
Come to you
and say "I did it?"

290
00:11:33,682 --> 00:11:38,015
A record of the call
from Ava's private, secure line.

291
00:11:38,088 --> 00:11:40,148
A call in which we discussed
the impediments

292
00:11:40,221 --> 00:11:41,251
to the pipeline,

293
00:11:41,316 --> 00:11:43,483
the six leaders
who stood in its way,

294
00:11:43,556 --> 00:11:46,127
and the cost
for their removal.

295
00:11:46,192 --> 00:11:49,328
$3 million,
which she admitted paying

296
00:11:49,401 --> 00:11:51,570
in the admission
you had her sign.

297
00:11:51,635 --> 00:11:55,638
I don't need the tape because
I have everything I need,

298
00:11:55,703 --> 00:11:58,638
including the fact that she lied
about that phone call.

299
00:12:09,188 --> 00:12:10,988
Hey.

300
00:12:11,053 --> 00:12:12,090
What happened to you
last night?

301
00:12:12,155 --> 00:12:13,720
I think you know
what happened.

302
00:12:13,793 --> 00:12:14,991
I saw you two yelling
at each other

303
00:12:15,057 --> 00:12:16,687
and I didn't want any part
of it.

304
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:19,329
Well, believe me, I didn't
want any part of it either.

305
00:12:19,394 --> 00:12:20,667
Well, what did you think
he was gonna do

306
00:12:20,732 --> 00:12:23,467
when he found out
you screwed up his case?

307
00:12:23,532 --> 00:12:25,136
I think you know that I wasn't
trying to screw it up.

308
00:12:25,201 --> 00:12:26,367
But you did.

309
00:12:26,432 --> 00:12:28,566
And he specifically told you
to stay away.

310
00:12:28,638 --> 00:12:30,933
And you told me not
to discuss you with him.

311
00:12:31,006 --> 00:12:33,102
So why are you discussing him
with me?

312
00:12:33,175 --> 00:12:35,278
Because I have a relationship
with him

313
00:12:35,343 --> 00:12:36,943
that's a lot longer
than a few weeks.

314
00:12:37,008 --> 00:12:38,982
And when you mess with him,
you mess with me.

315
00:12:39,047 --> 00:12:40,350
Donna, I wasn't trying
to mess with him.

316
00:12:40,415 --> 00:12:41,516
I was trying to help him.

317
00:12:41,581 --> 00:12:43,180
And as long as we're on
the subject,

318
00:12:43,245 --> 00:12:46,254
I'm sure he mentioned if
it wasn't for my previous help,

319
00:12:46,319 --> 00:12:49,117
he wouldn't still have Ava
as a client.

320
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:52,688
You know, he might've
mentioned something about that.

321
00:12:52,753 --> 00:12:56,917
Then can we get back
to not discussing him?

322
00:12:56,990 --> 00:12:58,493
As long as you promise
not to do anything

323
00:12:58,558 --> 00:13:02,524
to make us not discuss him
ever again.

324
00:13:02,597 --> 00:13:06,166
I promise.

325
00:13:06,231 --> 00:13:09,367
Good boy.

326
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,966
I'm gonna ask you once.

327
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:13,406
Is he telling
the truth?

328
00:13:13,471 --> 00:13:14,838
Yes.

329
00:13:14,911 --> 00:13:16,374
We had a conversation
on the phone

330
00:13:16,439 --> 00:13:18,845
but not about murder.

331
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:22,346
You didn't think we needed
to know?

332
00:13:22,411 --> 00:13:23,880
I didn't remember.

333
00:13:23,945 --> 00:13:25,911
That lie won't play well
in court.

334
00:13:25,976 --> 00:13:27,215
I told you about
the meeting.

335
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:29,110
I didn't think to tell you
about the call

336
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:30,246
where we agreed to meet.

337
00:13:30,319 --> 00:13:31,747
That's all it was.

338
00:13:31,812 --> 00:13:33,450
When? Where?
How much money?

339
00:13:33,515 --> 00:13:35,620
Not even that.
That was settled beforehand.

340
00:13:35,681 --> 00:13:36,880
It was a formality
Nick arranged.

341
00:13:36,953 --> 00:13:38,879
Nick Howell?
Your former protege?

342
00:13:38,952 --> 00:13:41,519
He dealt with these people.
He knew what's expected.

343
00:13:41,584 --> 00:13:44,885
It was a social nicety
so insignificant,

344
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:46,484
I didn't remember
until you brought it up.

345
00:13:46,557 --> 00:13:47,758
They brought it up.

346
00:13:47,823 --> 00:13:50,031
And now, they're gonna point out
that you didn't.

347
00:13:50,096 --> 00:13:52,597
I understand
it looks bad.

348
00:13:52,661 --> 00:13:54,531
But Edward said that this man
is a murderer.

349
00:13:54,596 --> 00:13:55,659
And there's no need for me
to be concerned--

350
00:13:55,732 --> 00:13:57,498
Edward Darby says
a lot of things

351
00:13:57,563 --> 00:13:59,360
you want to believe
but shouldn't.

352
00:13:59,433 --> 00:14:01,263
You don't believe me.

353
00:14:01,328 --> 00:14:02,430
Hiding a conversation

354
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:03,895
and then coming clean
about it later

355
00:14:03,938 --> 00:14:05,506
tends to get in the way
of trust.

356
00:14:05,571 --> 00:14:07,509
- Jessica--
- It makes you disingenuous.

357
00:14:07,574 --> 00:14:10,908
It makes you look guilty.

358
00:14:10,981 --> 00:14:12,314
I'm not.

359
00:14:12,379 --> 00:14:14,807
Do you find that people
usually kill your enemies

360
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,143
for you without your asking?

361
00:14:16,216 --> 00:14:19,080
- Jessica.
- Ava, you'll have to excuse us.

362
00:14:19,153 --> 00:14:20,321
We have to come up
with another plan

363
00:14:20,386 --> 00:14:24,398
because the one we had
just went to shit.

364
00:14:37,518 --> 00:14:39,923
I can't help but notice
you've come empty-handed.

365
00:14:39,988 --> 00:14:44,225
Not exactly.

366
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:54,231
You're suing me for ownership
of Mikado.

367
00:14:54,296 --> 00:14:55,464
On what grounds?

368
00:14:55,529 --> 00:14:57,065
On the grounds that I provide
a better home

369
00:14:57,137 --> 00:14:58,903
because you're constantly flying
around the world.

370
00:14:58,968 --> 00:15:00,798
Mary Poppins doesn't
get custody

371
00:15:00,871 --> 00:15:02,270
of the children
in her care.

372
00:15:02,335 --> 00:15:03,871
The Von Trapp children
fell in love with Maria.

373
00:15:03,944 --> 00:15:07,111
She became their mother.
Because their mother was dead.

374
00:15:07,176 --> 00:15:08,743
There's no legal basis
for this.

375
00:15:08,816 --> 00:15:10,848
You're confident
in that fact?

376
00:15:10,913 --> 00:15:11,913
Most assuredly.

377
00:15:11,986 --> 00:15:15,585
Then let's put it
to our own jury.

378
00:15:15,658 --> 00:15:17,456
You're suggesting
a mock trial.

379
00:15:17,521 --> 00:15:18,593
You get to prove you're
the better man

380
00:15:18,658 --> 00:15:20,626
in front
of our associates.

381
00:15:20,691 --> 00:15:23,026
You agree to hand her back
the moment the verdict is in?

382
00:15:23,099 --> 00:15:24,163
I agree to let you say
good-bye to her

383
00:15:24,228 --> 00:15:25,267
the moment
that you're defeated.

384
00:15:32,236 --> 00:15:34,307
Whatever the hell
that means.

385
00:15:34,372 --> 00:15:36,447
Glad to see you haven't lost
your touch with the clients.

386
00:15:36,511 --> 00:15:37,711
I don't have to be
nice to her.

387
00:15:37,752 --> 00:15:39,550
I just have to clean up
after her bullshit.

388
00:15:39,615 --> 00:15:41,613
She didn't lie.
She just made a mistake.

389
00:15:41,686 --> 00:15:43,418
We still have
to clean it up.

390
00:15:43,483 --> 00:15:45,080
And she just handed us
a road map.

391
00:15:45,153 --> 00:15:46,717
You wanna go after
Nick Howell.

392
00:15:46,782 --> 00:15:48,485
He's reasonable doubt
staring us right in the face.

393
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:50,254
It's a bad idea.

394
00:15:50,319 --> 00:15:52,254
He admitted to the bribe,
he set up the call,

395
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:54,158
and he was her man
on the ground.

396
00:15:54,223 --> 00:15:55,623
Laying it on Nick
would be admitting

397
00:15:55,626 --> 00:15:58,161
Hessington Oil paid Mariga
to kill those people.

398
00:15:58,234 --> 00:16:00,266
We already admitted
that Ava paid him.

399
00:16:00,331 --> 00:16:02,136
And Mariga already admitted
to the murders.

400
00:16:02,201 --> 00:16:04,062
This is exactly why
we should stick to the plan

401
00:16:04,135 --> 00:16:05,965
to destroy Mariga's testimony.

402
00:16:06,038 --> 00:16:07,037
Not wanting to be shot

403
00:16:07,102 --> 00:16:08,733
is a hell of an incentive
to lie.

404
00:16:08,806 --> 00:16:10,500
And an easy thing for a jury
to understand.

405
00:16:10,573 --> 00:16:13,106
Let me spell this out
for you.

406
00:16:13,171 --> 00:16:15,874
You don't just show
that your client didn't do it

407
00:16:15,939 --> 00:16:17,745
when you can point to someone
who did.

408
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,407
But you're never gonna
convince a jury

409
00:16:19,472 --> 00:16:23,144
the number one didn't know
what the number two was up to.

410
00:16:23,217 --> 00:16:24,816
You have the balls
to say that to me?

411
00:16:24,881 --> 00:16:25,984
I'm not saying--

412
00:16:26,049 --> 00:16:28,286
I don't care
what you're saying.

413
00:16:28,351 --> 00:16:30,150
I'm the one in charge
of this case.

414
00:16:30,215 --> 00:16:32,623
And believe me,
I can convince anyone

415
00:16:32,688 --> 00:16:34,360
of the fact
that a number two

416
00:16:34,424 --> 00:16:38,927
can betray a number one
behind her back.

417
00:16:38,992 --> 00:16:42,126
Out.

418
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:58,329
- You still hiding from Nigel?
- What?

419
00:16:58,385 --> 00:16:59,312
No, I'm looking
for Katrina.

420
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:03,016
She just left
for Barcelona.

421
00:17:04,721 --> 00:17:05,824
Sorry? She what?

422
00:17:05,889 --> 00:17:08,558
The training program.

423
00:17:08,623 --> 00:17:10,861
- Nesbitt.
- Why would he send her away?

424
00:17:10,926 --> 00:17:12,125
Because he knew I'd pick her
to represent me

425
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:13,556
at Mikado's custody hearing.

426
00:17:13,629 --> 00:17:16,291
You're suing for custody?
Louis, that's insane.

427
00:17:16,364 --> 00:17:18,426
- Rachel, he abandoned her.
- He went on a business trip.

428
00:17:18,499 --> 00:17:19,898
- Okay, whose side are you on?
- Yours.

429
00:17:19,963 --> 00:17:21,434
But the law is not
with you.

430
00:17:21,499 --> 00:17:22,434
What, you think
when you become a lawyer,

431
00:17:22,499 --> 00:17:23,580
you're gonna be
trying cases

432
00:17:23,603 --> 00:17:24,465
where the law
is always on your side?

433
00:17:24,538 --> 00:17:25,536
- Louis.
- Rachel.

434
00:17:25,601 --> 00:17:26,767
You need to tell me
which associate

435
00:17:26,832 --> 00:17:30,238
is least loyal
to Nigel now.

436
00:17:30,303 --> 00:17:31,440
- Kaufman.
- No, too green.

437
00:17:31,505 --> 00:17:32,608
Corcoran.

438
00:17:32,673 --> 00:17:33,912
The guy owned a hamster
as a child.

439
00:17:33,977 --> 00:17:36,879
He'll view a cat
as a predator.

440
00:17:36,945 --> 00:17:38,943
- Donahue?
- D-D-D-D-D-Donahue?

441
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:40,936
I'll not only lose custody,
I may end up in jail.

442
00:17:40,952 --> 00:17:43,086
- For what?
- Rachel, I stole the man's cat.

443
00:17:43,151 --> 00:17:45,182
And I need someone
who understands why.

444
00:17:45,254 --> 00:17:47,883
Then who, Louis?

445
00:17:52,922 --> 00:17:54,423
You.

446
00:17:54,489 --> 00:17:56,925
- I'm not a lawyer, Louis.
- You're gonna be soon enough.

447
00:17:56,990 --> 00:17:58,689
You run circles around
those clowns.

448
00:17:58,754 --> 00:18:02,254
And Nigel holds no sway
over you.

449
00:18:02,319 --> 00:18:04,728
Okay.

450
00:18:04,793 --> 00:18:07,730
You are asking me to help you
steal Nigel's cat.

451
00:18:10,068 --> 00:18:13,543
Rachel, you know how tough
it's been for me this year.

452
00:18:13,608 --> 00:18:16,007
I lost the associates.

453
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:19,047
Mike made a fool of me.

454
00:18:19,113 --> 00:18:20,713
I saw Harvey's name go up
on the wall.

455
00:18:20,786 --> 00:18:23,518
And I went home.

456
00:18:23,583 --> 00:18:26,990
But you know
what happened?

457
00:18:27,055 --> 00:18:28,486
Mikado saw my pain.

458
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:31,694
And she brought me
a mouse.

459
00:18:37,292 --> 00:18:39,458
Louis, we have a murder trial
going on.

460
00:18:39,531 --> 00:18:42,466
A trial that I have nothing
to do with.

461
00:18:46,036 --> 00:18:49,741
Rachel, I love her.

462
00:18:49,806 --> 00:18:52,014
Now, I once fought valiantly
for your dream.

463
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:56,083
And even though I lost...

464
00:18:58,149 --> 00:19:02,457
I'm asking you.

465
00:19:02,523 --> 00:19:05,465
Fight for mine?

466
00:19:10,664 --> 00:19:12,198
Jessica!

467
00:19:12,263 --> 00:19:13,598
You have something for me
on Nick Howell?

468
00:19:13,671 --> 00:19:15,070
Nick Howell
didn't do this.

469
00:19:15,135 --> 00:19:16,334
Yeah, what the hell does
that have to do with anything?

470
00:19:16,407 --> 00:19:18,006
Look, Harvey's problem
with going after Nick

471
00:19:18,071 --> 00:19:19,910
is that it might backfire
on Ava, right?

472
00:19:19,975 --> 00:19:21,342
But even if it doesn't,
we're still putting

473
00:19:21,407 --> 00:19:22,768
an innocent man
in the cross hairs.

474
00:19:22,807 --> 00:19:24,645
An innocent man.

475
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:26,479
He sold out Ava the second
he had a chance.

476
00:19:26,552 --> 00:19:28,151
And I sat there
and watched him do it.

477
00:19:28,217 --> 00:19:29,697
Cameron had him backed
against a wall.

478
00:19:29,753 --> 00:19:30,913
He just did what he had
to do.

479
00:19:30,921 --> 00:19:32,352
And now, we're backed up
against a wall.

480
00:19:32,424 --> 00:19:35,355
And I don't give a shit
about Ava's number two.

481
00:19:35,419 --> 00:19:38,155
He can rot in hell
for all I care.

482
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:42,094
I just have
one question.

483
00:19:42,167 --> 00:19:46,230
Are you going after him
because he tried to sell Ava out

484
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:50,173
or because Harvey
tried to sell you out?

485
00:19:50,238 --> 00:19:51,471
What did you just say
to me?

486
00:19:51,544 --> 00:19:53,407
I just wanna make sure
we're not potentially

487
00:19:53,472 --> 00:19:54,607
throwing a man's
life away

488
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:58,217
just because you're mad
at someone else.

489
00:19:58,282 --> 00:19:59,913
Instead of you coming
down here

490
00:19:59,986 --> 00:20:02,249
and telling me
who to be mad at,

491
00:20:02,322 --> 00:20:03,890
why don't you do
your job?

492
00:20:03,955 --> 00:20:06,557
And find out what the hell
Cameron has on Nick Howell

493
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:09,904
that had him turn on Ava
in the first place

494
00:20:09,969 --> 00:20:12,400
because if you think all it was
was that tape,

495
00:20:12,474 --> 00:20:16,410
then you don't know
what the hell you're doing.

496
00:20:26,432 --> 00:20:29,463
They wanna talk settlement
and they sent you?

497
00:20:29,536 --> 00:20:31,334
No, they didn't.

498
00:20:31,399 --> 00:20:33,438
So you're going rogue?
Bullshit.

499
00:20:33,503 --> 00:20:35,733
I don't buy it--
You can buy whatever you want.

500
00:20:35,805 --> 00:20:37,500
The fact is you, Harvey,
and Jessica

501
00:20:37,573 --> 00:20:38,941
are so busy trying
to beat each other,

502
00:20:39,006 --> 00:20:41,078
you can't see you all have
your heads up your asses.

503
00:20:41,143 --> 00:20:43,141
Cocky, I get it.
Harvey taught you well.

504
00:20:43,214 --> 00:20:47,076
No, what Harvey taught me
is to help my client.

505
00:20:47,149 --> 00:20:48,549
Now, look.

506
00:20:48,614 --> 00:20:50,423
I can't guarantee you
that we'll agree to anything.

507
00:20:50,488 --> 00:20:52,856
But Ava deserves
an offer.

508
00:20:52,922 --> 00:20:54,794
I spelled out my offer
a week ago.

509
00:20:54,859 --> 00:20:56,330
Yeah, an offer based on
a bluff.

510
00:20:56,395 --> 00:20:57,594
Huh, now,
I've got the real deal.

511
00:20:57,667 --> 00:20:59,898
It was 9.
Now, it's 12.

512
00:20:59,963 --> 00:21:02,137
Your real deal is
a confessed murderer

513
00:21:02,203 --> 00:21:03,571
and a vindictive ex-employee.

514
00:21:03,636 --> 00:21:06,108
I've got one saying
that Ava paid for it.

515
00:21:06,173 --> 00:21:09,340
And another saying she knew
what she was paying for.

516
00:21:09,413 --> 00:21:11,348
Great, then get me
a goddamn offer under nine,

517
00:21:11,413 --> 00:21:12,381
and I'll get you
a deal.

518
00:21:12,446 --> 00:21:14,783
This negotiation
is over, Junior.

519
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:16,319
Take your ball
and go home.

520
00:21:16,384 --> 00:21:18,288
You really are a dick.

521
00:21:18,361 --> 00:21:20,624
- What did you say?
- I said you're a dick.

522
00:21:20,697 --> 00:21:24,126
And you can take your offer
and shove it up your ass.

523
00:21:29,195 --> 00:21:31,835
I am so sorry.
You little piss ant.

524
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,835
I can't believe
this shit.

525
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,602
Who the hell do you think
you're dealing with?

526
00:21:35,667 --> 00:21:37,001
You know, I could have
you locked up

527
00:21:37,066 --> 00:21:38,200
for assault right now?

528
00:21:38,272 --> 00:21:39,238
Yeah, I'm sorry.

529
00:21:39,303 --> 00:21:41,700
You know, I just--
I lost my head.

530
00:21:41,773 --> 00:21:43,639
Please.

531
00:21:43,704 --> 00:21:45,175
I-I was just trying
to do my job.

532
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:49,016
Take your mediation and get
the hell out of my office.

533
00:21:49,081 --> 00:21:52,882
Yes, sir.

534
00:21:55,858 --> 00:21:57,381
Mr. Litt,
how would you describe

535
00:21:57,454 --> 00:22:00,924
Mikado's well-being
when she came under your care?

536
00:22:00,989 --> 00:22:04,628
Well, Mikado's physical needs
were taken care of.

537
00:22:04,693 --> 00:22:06,429
But there's more to a cat
than its physical condition.

538
00:22:06,494 --> 00:22:07,693
They're highly
emotional creatures.

539
00:22:07,766 --> 00:22:09,565
And were her emotional needs
tended to?

540
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:11,966
Calls for speculation.
He's not the cat whisperer.

541
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:14,735
He can't testify
to Mikado's thoughts,

542
00:22:14,808 --> 00:22:16,905
which you should've
objected to.

543
00:22:16,978 --> 00:22:19,011
- Sorry, sir.
- Very well.

544
00:22:19,084 --> 00:22:21,948
Mr. Litt,
without speaking for Mikado,

545
00:22:22,021 --> 00:22:24,019
would you describe
for the court

546
00:22:24,084 --> 00:22:25,721
her emotional condition?

547
00:22:25,786 --> 00:22:28,018
When Mikado first entered
my home,

548
00:22:28,091 --> 00:22:30,925
she was aloof
and standoffish.

549
00:22:30,998 --> 00:22:32,494
She's a cat.

550
00:22:32,567 --> 00:22:34,296
Sorry.
I'll wait my turn.

551
00:22:34,368 --> 00:22:35,598
She was listless,
you know?

552
00:22:35,671 --> 00:22:38,132
Like, I would take her out
to see a bird

553
00:22:38,197 --> 00:22:40,636
or a dog.

554
00:22:40,701 --> 00:22:43,680
And there'd just
be nothing.

555
00:22:43,745 --> 00:22:44,946
You know what I think?
Hm?

556
00:22:45,011 --> 00:22:47,181
I think that she was
the victim of neglect

557
00:22:47,255 --> 00:22:48,820
due to the absence
of a consistent father figure

558
00:22:48,885 --> 00:22:49,956
because he's traveling
all the time.

559
00:22:50,021 --> 00:22:51,492
- I object.
- To what?

560
00:22:51,557 --> 00:22:53,956
To you letting him talk
about my cat that way.

561
00:22:54,021 --> 00:22:55,861
You changed the rules
to get Ms. Zane.

562
00:22:55,926 --> 00:22:58,969
I'm changing the rules.
I'm gonna represent myself.

563
00:22:59,034 --> 00:23:00,074
- But--
- You're dismissed.

564
00:23:05,476 --> 00:23:06,908
Getting hot in here, Nesbitt?

565
00:23:06,981 --> 00:23:08,477
Mr. Litt, I'll ask you
not to address

566
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:10,084
the defendant directly.

567
00:23:10,149 --> 00:23:11,852
I'm not the defendant.

568
00:23:11,917 --> 00:23:13,588
This isn't
a criminal trial.

569
00:23:13,654 --> 00:23:15,324
Well, it should be.

570
00:23:15,389 --> 00:23:16,557
Where were we?

571
00:23:16,622 --> 00:23:18,663
You were describing
the deplorable condition

572
00:23:18,728 --> 00:23:20,666
in which you found
Mr. Nesbitt's cat.

573
00:23:20,731 --> 00:23:23,969
Oh, yeah.

574
00:23:24,034 --> 00:23:26,571
Jessica, I've been expecting
your call.

575
00:23:26,636 --> 00:23:28,310
You aren't expecting
<i>this</i> call.

576
00:23:28,375 --> 00:23:30,047
It was pointed out
to me

577
00:23:30,112 --> 00:23:32,247
that I had misplaced
some of my anger.

578
00:23:32,312 --> 00:23:34,150
So I've decided to place
some of it on you.

579
00:23:34,215 --> 00:23:35,886
Then this is the call
I was expecting.

580
00:23:35,951 --> 00:23:38,254
You've heard about Stephen?
I heard about you.

581
00:23:38,318 --> 00:23:40,084
And your deal
with Harvey.

582
00:23:41,252 --> 00:23:42,652
I was wondering
when you'd find out.

583
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:44,119
Save it.

584
00:23:44,184 --> 00:23:45,516
I thought when I got rid
of Daniel Hardman,

585
00:23:45,589 --> 00:23:47,387
I was done with partners
I couldn't trust.

586
00:23:47,452 --> 00:23:48,955
I assume you're referring
to Harvey

587
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:51,554
because I'm not the one
who proposed that deal.

588
00:23:51,619 --> 00:23:54,486
Him asking isn't the same
as you accepting.

589
00:23:54,552 --> 00:23:56,053
No, it isn't,
but he was going to quit

590
00:23:56,126 --> 00:23:57,051
because of you.

591
00:23:57,124 --> 00:23:58,783
And that deal
made him stay.

592
00:23:58,848 --> 00:24:01,651
And as you said yourself,
he is essential to the firm.

593
00:24:01,716 --> 00:24:03,418
Not more essential
than me.

594
00:24:03,483 --> 00:24:05,418
And as for your deal
with Harvey,

595
00:24:05,491 --> 00:24:08,154
it doesn't exist because
he doesn't want it anymore.

596
00:24:08,227 --> 00:24:10,625
Which was my hope
from the beginning.

597
00:24:10,691 --> 00:24:13,457
You are a saint,
aren't you?

598
00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:15,268
I'm not sure
I fully understand

599
00:24:15,333 --> 00:24:16,797
the purpose of this call.

600
00:24:16,869 --> 00:24:18,333
I want
Stephen Huntley gone.

601
00:24:18,406 --> 00:24:20,142
I won't allow him to do
any more damage.

602
00:24:20,207 --> 00:24:23,439
When you have a problem,
you turn to Harvey.

603
00:24:23,512 --> 00:24:26,279
Stephen fills that role
for me.

604
00:24:26,344 --> 00:24:28,246
You want him gone?
Win the case.

605
00:24:28,311 --> 00:24:30,213
He'll be on the next
flight out.

606
00:24:30,278 --> 00:24:33,982
Edward, Harvey and I
are going to win this case.

607
00:24:34,055 --> 00:24:37,022
And then you and I are going
to have a conversation

608
00:24:37,087 --> 00:24:40,059
about the future
of this merger.

609
00:24:40,124 --> 00:24:42,522
Ah, now I understand.

610
00:24:42,595 --> 00:24:43,762
What?

611
00:24:43,827 --> 00:24:46,225
By telling you about my part
in his deal,

612
00:24:46,298 --> 00:24:48,192
he's turned you
against the very merger

613
00:24:48,264 --> 00:24:50,261
he never wanted
in the first place.

614
00:24:50,326 --> 00:24:52,490
Harvey had nothing to do
with this.

615
00:24:52,563 --> 00:24:55,297
Hadn't he?

616
00:24:55,362 --> 00:24:59,833
Goodbye, Edward.

617
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,503
You have portrayed yourself

618
00:25:09,576 --> 00:25:12,678
as the kindhearted savior

619
00:25:12,743 --> 00:25:15,109
of this feline soul.

620
00:25:15,182 --> 00:25:17,149
Is that correct?
Yeah.

621
00:25:17,214 --> 00:25:18,894
I believe I've brought out
the best in her.

622
00:25:18,917 --> 00:25:20,717
So you have a way
with your charges?

623
00:25:20,782 --> 00:25:24,258
A velvet glove,
so to speak?

624
00:25:24,323 --> 00:25:25,924
I guess you could say
I'm built that way.

625
00:25:25,932 --> 00:25:27,732
So you're a good parent?

626
00:25:27,797 --> 00:25:29,730
Um, a role model?

627
00:25:29,795 --> 00:25:31,799
No one could
say otherwise.

628
00:25:31,864 --> 00:25:35,267
So if one of your charges
were to say you were hostile,

629
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:39,678
cruel, prone to kicking
the proverbial dog,

630
00:25:39,743 --> 00:25:41,045
would that be a lie?

631
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:43,442
My treatment of felines is
what's of issue here.

632
00:25:43,515 --> 00:25:45,082
I thought it was
your parenting skills,

633
00:25:45,147 --> 00:25:46,627
your ability to mold
and shape gently.

634
00:25:46,683 --> 00:25:47,978
But that's not--

635
00:25:48,051 --> 00:25:50,920
This jury knows all about
your parenting skills,

636
00:25:50,985 --> 00:25:53,549
which involve
berating, belittling,

637
00:25:53,614 --> 00:25:55,518
screaming, sadism--

638
00:25:55,583 --> 00:25:57,151
Objection!

639
00:25:57,224 --> 00:25:58,591
You can object
all you like.

640
00:25:58,656 --> 00:26:03,157
But as I said,
this jury knows

641
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:06,258
that that man is not
what he portrays himself to be.

642
00:26:06,323 --> 00:26:07,690
And what about you?

643
00:26:07,763 --> 00:26:09,361
You think molding and shaping
is accomplished

644
00:26:09,426 --> 00:26:10,832
by abandoning your charges

645
00:26:10,897 --> 00:26:12,263
and sending
the occasional memo

646
00:26:12,329 --> 00:26:15,630
while you're off mudding
in the Yangtze?

647
00:26:15,703 --> 00:26:16,983
I'd like to call
my next witness.

648
00:26:17,031 --> 00:26:17,998
Oh, really?
What witness?

649
00:26:18,071 --> 00:26:19,437
You didn't declare
a witness.

650
00:26:19,502 --> 00:26:21,774
He's a hostile witness.

651
00:26:21,839 --> 00:26:24,808
And I'm afraid he's hostile
to you.

652
00:26:24,874 --> 00:26:28,142
I call Harold Gunderson
to the stand.

653
00:26:32,515 --> 00:26:34,115
Holy shit.
We're in trouble.

654
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:36,021
We need
a ten-minute recess.

655
00:26:39,852 --> 00:26:41,387
Ah, uh, no, no, Rachel,
I'm sorry,

656
00:26:41,452 --> 00:26:42,689
but I can't talk
right now.

657
00:26:42,754 --> 00:26:45,022
I am typing up Cameron's files
from memory.

658
00:26:45,087 --> 00:26:47,358
Mike, I am going to lose
my first case...

659
00:26:47,423 --> 00:26:48,591
- Uh-huh.
- A mock case...

660
00:26:48,656 --> 00:26:52,499
- Okay.
- About a cat.

661
00:26:52,564 --> 00:26:55,539
Okay, that,
I have a couple of minutes for.

662
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,501
Nigel dug up Harold.

663
00:26:57,566 --> 00:26:58,900
What? He's gonna throw Louis
under the bus.

664
00:26:58,965 --> 00:26:59,900
Which is why I need
your help.

665
00:26:59,965 --> 00:27:01,003
I need you to remember

666
00:27:01,068 --> 00:27:02,866
anything good he said
about Louis.

667
00:27:02,931 --> 00:27:04,969
- I can't.
- What are you talking about?

668
00:27:05,034 --> 00:27:06,370
You were just referring
to your amazing memory.

669
00:27:06,435 --> 00:27:07,915
No, it's not
that I can't remember it.

670
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:10,312
It's that he never said
anything good.

671
00:27:10,385 --> 00:27:11,616
Oh, my God.
I'm screwed.

672
00:27:11,681 --> 00:27:13,015
I'm so sorry, Rachel,
but I have to go.

673
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,582
What> Are you kidding?
You've got--you've got nothing?

674
00:27:14,647 --> 00:27:16,253
What I have is complete faith
in you.

675
00:27:16,318 --> 00:27:17,820
So say hi to Harold
for me

676
00:27:17,885 --> 00:27:20,753
before you figure out a way
to screw him.

677
00:27:20,818 --> 00:27:22,322
Huh.

678
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,692
Jessica was right.
There's dirt on Nick.

679
00:27:29,757 --> 00:27:30,725
Where'd you get this?

680
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:32,190
It's courtesy
of Cameron Dennis.

681
00:27:32,264 --> 00:27:33,895
I actually went in there--
Holy shit.

682
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,927
I know, there's enough there
to point the finger at him.

683
00:27:35,999 --> 00:27:38,167
There's enough here to make me
think that he really did it.

684
00:27:38,233 --> 00:27:39,905
So what do
you wanna do?

685
00:27:39,970 --> 00:27:40,969
Go tell Jessica
she was right

686
00:27:41,042 --> 00:27:42,322
and then get Nick Howell
in here.

687
00:27:42,373 --> 00:27:43,340
And make sure he doesn't have
an answer for this

688
00:27:43,412 --> 00:27:44,347
before we get to court.

689
00:27:44,412 --> 00:27:45,347
On it.

690
00:27:49,366 --> 00:27:51,713
Mr. Gunderson,
you are currently

691
00:27:51,738 --> 00:27:53,668
an associate at Bratton Gould.

692
00:27:53,669 --> 00:27:56,606
At what firm
did you previously work?

693
00:27:56,671 --> 00:27:57,878
I worked here.

694
00:27:57,943 --> 00:28:00,206
And who was
your supervisor?

695
00:28:00,279 --> 00:28:01,877
That man, Louis Litt.

696
00:28:01,942 --> 00:28:03,077
Really, Harold?

697
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:04,877
Let the record show
that Mr. Gunderson

698
00:28:04,949 --> 00:28:06,916
indicated Mr. Litt.

699
00:28:06,981 --> 00:28:10,420
Tell me about
Mr. Litt's guidance.

700
00:28:10,486 --> 00:28:12,285
Louis believes
in teaching by fear.

701
00:28:12,358 --> 00:28:13,790
Your Honor, I'd just like
to state for the record

702
00:28:13,855 --> 00:28:16,136
that the witness is speaking
into an imaginary microphone.

703
00:28:16,161 --> 00:28:17,632
You're speaking into
an imaginary microphone.

704
00:28:17,697 --> 00:28:18,896
- That's what I mean.
- You know what?

705
00:28:18,969 --> 00:28:20,096
Fine, I'm done.
Proceed.

706
00:28:20,169 --> 00:28:23,369
Would you characterize him
as a-a screamer?

707
00:28:23,434 --> 00:28:26,273
A tyrant?
Petty and vindictive?

708
00:28:26,338 --> 00:28:27,778
All of the above.

709
00:28:27,843 --> 00:28:32,055
He didn't try to gently sculpt
your future like blown glass?

710
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:34,626
He called me an idiot,
an imbecile,

711
00:28:34,691 --> 00:28:36,826
and an embarrassment
to the legal profession.

712
00:28:36,891 --> 00:28:38,162
That sounds harsh.

713
00:28:38,227 --> 00:28:40,427
My therapist says
that I have scars on my psyche.

714
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:42,403
- Hearsay.
- I could call said therapist.

715
00:28:42,468 --> 00:28:43,731
Oh, that'd be lovely,

716
00:28:43,804 --> 00:28:45,539
except it still has nothing
to do with the cat.

717
00:28:45,604 --> 00:28:48,140
Uh, bear with me.
I'm getting there.

718
00:28:48,206 --> 00:28:52,745
Uh, tell me about Bruno.

719
00:28:55,122 --> 00:28:56,585
He was Louis' cat.

720
00:28:56,650 --> 00:28:58,585
I was made to take care
of him.

721
00:28:58,657 --> 00:29:01,762
- He didn't do it himself?
- No.

722
00:29:01,827 --> 00:29:03,459
Do you like cats, Harold?

723
00:29:03,533 --> 00:29:05,826
No.

724
00:29:05,899 --> 00:29:07,561
I'm allergic.

725
00:29:07,634 --> 00:29:08,800
I don't even know
what to do with them.

726
00:29:08,865 --> 00:29:12,102
But he left this cat,
his cat,

727
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:13,832
in your care?

728
00:29:13,905 --> 00:29:15,001
What happened?
Hey, you know what?

729
00:29:15,074 --> 00:29:16,474
This would be a good time
to object.

730
00:29:16,536 --> 00:29:18,775
I can't, Louis, it's a valid
line of questioning.

731
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:22,679
What happened,
Mr. Gunderson?

732
00:29:22,744 --> 00:29:25,050
He died a day later.

733
00:29:25,115 --> 00:29:28,185
And what did he say to you
prior to that day?

734
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:30,750
He said he might as well
have left his cat

735
00:29:30,815 --> 00:29:31,981
with Michael Vick.

736
00:29:41,431 --> 00:29:42,831
I didn't realize
she'd be here.

737
00:29:42,896 --> 00:29:44,903
Didn't want to look me
in the eye?

738
00:29:44,968 --> 00:29:46,166
Ava, I'm sorry.

739
00:29:46,231 --> 00:29:48,239
I'm glad I can help you
as a character witness.

740
00:29:48,304 --> 00:29:49,871
I had no idea admitting
to the bribe

741
00:29:49,936 --> 00:29:50,944
would lead
to this nonsense.

742
00:29:51,009 --> 00:29:53,514
Solicitation of murder
is nonsense?

743
00:29:53,579 --> 00:29:55,778
You know what I meant,
that Ava would never do that.

744
00:29:55,851 --> 00:29:58,051
Oh, we agree.
We don't think she would.

745
00:29:58,116 --> 00:30:00,754
We think you would.

746
00:30:00,819 --> 00:30:02,489
What? You're trying
to blame the murders on me?

747
00:30:02,553 --> 00:30:04,424
You met with Mariga
before Ava did.

748
00:30:04,489 --> 00:30:06,823
You made the arrangements.
You agreed on the payments.

749
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:08,455
You know all this.

750
00:30:08,527 --> 00:30:10,422
But we didn't
know this.

751
00:30:10,495 --> 00:30:12,862
Mr. Howell is being shown
a record of deposits

752
00:30:12,927 --> 00:30:14,662
into a numbered
Swiss bank account

753
00:30:14,727 --> 00:30:16,630
opened one week
after the murders.

754
00:30:16,695 --> 00:30:18,431
- How did you get this?
- Are you saying it's not yours?

755
00:30:18,504 --> 00:30:19,432
It's not what it seems.

756
00:30:19,504 --> 00:30:21,103
Then tell us
what it is

757
00:30:21,168 --> 00:30:23,807
because what it looks like
is a split of the take.

758
00:30:23,873 --> 00:30:25,408
How much did Mariga
cut you in for?

759
00:30:25,473 --> 00:30:27,514
- These are bonuses.
- Bonuses?

760
00:30:27,579 --> 00:30:28,683
Part of my deal,

761
00:30:28,748 --> 00:30:30,252
incentive payments
for getting the job done

762
00:30:30,317 --> 00:30:31,621
under hardship conditions.

763
00:30:31,686 --> 00:30:33,157
The only hardship you had
was finding someone

764
00:30:33,222 --> 00:30:34,493
to kill those people.

765
00:30:34,558 --> 00:30:37,357
You split the take with Mariga
then hid your share.

766
00:30:37,429 --> 00:30:39,197
This money didn't come
from Colonel Mariga.

767
00:30:39,262 --> 00:30:41,629
It came from Hessington Oil
and she knows it.

768
00:30:41,694 --> 00:30:43,429
You can't keep pointing
the finger at Ava.

769
00:30:43,502 --> 00:30:44,799
You acted alone on this.

770
00:30:44,872 --> 00:30:47,208
I have emails
asking for her authorization

771
00:30:47,273 --> 00:30:48,640
to make bonus payments.

772
00:30:48,705 --> 00:30:51,607
Those emails didn't mention
Swiss bank accounts.

773
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,447
Because I knew you wouldn't
want them to.

774
00:30:53,512 --> 00:30:54,743
Bullshit.

775
00:30:54,816 --> 00:30:56,511
It didn't mention
Swiss bank accounts

776
00:30:56,583 --> 00:31:00,149
because you went to Mariga
and arranged everything.

777
00:31:00,214 --> 00:31:01,452
I didn't even
know Mariga.

778
00:31:01,517 --> 00:31:03,715
He came to me.
He laid out a bribe.

779
00:31:03,788 --> 00:31:06,053
I accepted it.
And Ava knew everything I did.

780
00:31:06,126 --> 00:31:07,653
- That's a lie.
- She knew.

781
00:31:07,726 --> 00:31:09,461
She just didn't know
the specifics.

782
00:31:09,526 --> 00:31:10,893
And now, you're acting
like this means

783
00:31:10,958 --> 00:31:13,524
that I ordered the killing
of those people.

784
00:31:13,597 --> 00:31:15,500
Well, I didn't.

785
00:31:15,563 --> 00:31:16,897
And if you try to make it look
like I did

786
00:31:16,962 --> 00:31:19,095
without her knowledge,
no jury's ever going

787
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:22,461
to believe it
because it's not true.

788
00:31:30,467 --> 00:31:32,167
Mr. Gunderson,
your tenure at this law firm

789
00:31:32,232 --> 00:31:33,933
wasn't very successful,
was it?

790
00:31:33,998 --> 00:31:35,364
I worked very hard.

791
00:31:35,437 --> 00:31:36,935
Is it true that you once
failed to deliver

792
00:31:37,008 --> 00:31:38,504
a motion to the court
because you thought

793
00:31:38,577 --> 00:31:40,217
they were closed
due to inclement weather?

794
00:31:40,281 --> 00:31:41,913
Someone told me
that it was a snow day.

795
00:31:41,978 --> 00:31:43,314
Did you ever give
opposing counsel

796
00:31:43,379 --> 00:31:44,849
a copy
of our trial strategy?

797
00:31:44,914 --> 00:31:46,314
I thought it was part
of disclosure.

798
00:31:46,386 --> 00:31:48,584
Did you leave a zero off
the Hopkins settlement,

799
00:31:48,649 --> 00:31:52,352
nearly costing
the client $900,000?

800
00:31:54,089 --> 00:31:55,823
No one was supposed to know
about that.

801
00:31:55,896 --> 00:31:58,126
Because Louis covered
for you.

802
00:31:58,191 --> 00:31:59,694
- He berated me.
- No.

803
00:31:59,759 --> 00:32:00,926
He kept it private.

804
00:32:00,999 --> 00:32:02,631
And he allowed you to go back
and fix it.

805
00:32:02,696 --> 00:32:04,905
Did he not?
He did.

806
00:32:04,970 --> 00:32:06,571
Which allowed you to learn
from your mistakes.

807
00:32:06,644 --> 00:32:08,570
Did it not?
I guess.

808
00:32:08,643 --> 00:32:10,242
You testified that you now
work at Bratton Gould.

809
00:32:10,307 --> 00:32:11,577
Is that correct?
Yes.

810
00:32:11,642 --> 00:32:12,809
And when
they hired you,

811
00:32:12,874 --> 00:32:14,881
did they know you'd been trained
by Louis Litt?

812
00:32:14,946 --> 00:32:16,115
It came up.

813
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:18,284
So they knew
that you were nurtured by Louis.

814
00:32:18,357 --> 00:32:19,683
They hired you.

815
00:32:19,756 --> 00:32:24,027
And now,
are you happy?

816
00:32:24,092 --> 00:32:25,028
Yes.

817
00:32:25,093 --> 00:32:26,460
So with Louis' nurturance,

818
00:32:26,526 --> 00:32:28,166
your mistakes were covered,

819
00:32:28,231 --> 00:32:29,827
you landed another job,

820
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:30,826
and you're happy.

821
00:32:30,899 --> 00:32:32,592
Isn't that correct?

822
00:32:32,665 --> 00:32:33,928
But he was mean
to me.

823
00:32:34,001 --> 00:32:36,064
No, this isn't about how
he treated you, Harold.

824
00:32:36,137 --> 00:32:39,302
This is about how he treated
his cat.

825
00:32:39,367 --> 00:32:42,071
And isn't the truth
that he loved that cat

826
00:32:42,136 --> 00:32:46,777
and cared for him
with all of his heart?

827
00:32:49,619 --> 00:32:51,847
Harold, you're under oath.
No, I'm not.

828
00:32:51,912 --> 00:32:55,382
Harold.

829
00:32:55,455 --> 00:32:57,517
Yes, he loved Bruno
with all of his heart.

830
00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:07,293
I have
no further questions.

831
00:33:20,309 --> 00:33:22,907
Hey.

832
00:33:22,972 --> 00:33:26,181
What a lovely surprise.
And I come bearing gifts.

833
00:33:26,246 --> 00:33:27,183
Oh, you didn't have
to do that.

834
00:33:27,248 --> 00:33:28,551
Oh, well,
it's only right.

835
00:33:28,616 --> 00:33:30,151
You've given me
so many things.

836
00:33:30,224 --> 00:33:32,959
And I've never
given you anything.

837
00:33:33,024 --> 00:33:35,360
Well, anything like this.

838
00:33:35,425 --> 00:33:37,359
What is it?

839
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:40,167
I'm surprised
you don't recognize it.

840
00:33:40,232 --> 00:33:44,071
It's a copy
of Colonel Mariga's deposition.

841
00:33:44,136 --> 00:33:46,503
My copy count didn't reconcile
with the machine.

842
00:33:46,568 --> 00:33:48,934
It was off
by seven pages,

843
00:33:49,007 --> 00:33:53,407
the exact amount of that.

844
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:56,183
You thought
I wouldn't notice.

845
00:33:56,248 --> 00:33:58,112
I would.

846
00:33:58,185 --> 00:33:59,488
- You spied on me.
- Oh, no.

847
00:33:59,554 --> 00:34:00,985
I trusted you.

848
00:34:01,058 --> 00:34:03,122
- Donna...
- Don't Donna me.

849
00:34:03,187 --> 00:34:06,692
You looked me in the face
and you made me a promise.

850
00:34:06,765 --> 00:34:08,364
I also made a promise
to Edward Darby.

851
00:34:08,429 --> 00:34:10,100
And I made a promise
to Harvey.

852
00:34:10,165 --> 00:34:11,300
And I wouldn't make
another one

853
00:34:11,365 --> 00:34:12,934
if I knew I could only
keep one.

854
00:34:13,007 --> 00:34:15,312
So you're choosing
what you don't have with him

855
00:34:15,377 --> 00:34:16,938
over something that you do have
with me?

856
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:19,781
This has nothing to do
with him.

857
00:34:19,854 --> 00:34:20,989
I don't care if you said
you'd stay out

858
00:34:21,054 --> 00:34:23,189
of Norma's business
and you went back on it.

859
00:34:23,254 --> 00:34:26,694
You lied to me.

860
00:34:26,759 --> 00:34:30,727
We're done.

861
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,032
Oh.

862
00:34:32,097 --> 00:34:35,369
And by the way,
you're welcome.

863
00:34:35,442 --> 00:34:36,505
For what?

864
00:34:36,571 --> 00:34:39,108
For not telling Harvey
about this.

865
00:34:39,181 --> 00:34:40,245
Because if he found out,

866
00:34:40,318 --> 00:34:41,717
he would beat the shit
outta you.

867
00:34:50,895 --> 00:34:51,855
Watch what you're doing.

868
00:34:51,896 --> 00:34:53,231
I wasn't actually moving.

869
00:34:53,296 --> 00:34:55,928
Yeah, well,
I don't actually care.

870
00:34:56,001 --> 00:34:57,834
- Donna, are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

871
00:34:57,907 --> 00:34:59,307
Hey, Donna.

872
00:34:59,372 --> 00:35:01,204
I don't wanna talk
about it, okay?

873
00:35:01,277 --> 00:35:02,940
You'll tell Harvey.
He'll get furious--

874
00:35:03,012 --> 00:35:04,043
I won't tell Harvey.

875
00:35:04,108 --> 00:35:05,443
Yeah, another promise.

876
00:35:05,516 --> 00:35:08,547
Donna.

877
00:35:08,613 --> 00:35:11,118
He just couldn't keep his nose
out of it.

878
00:35:11,191 --> 00:35:13,328
Who couldn't keep his nose
out of what?

879
00:35:13,393 --> 00:35:17,727
Stephen got
Mariga's deposition.

880
00:35:17,792 --> 00:35:18,726
You know what?

881
00:35:18,799 --> 00:35:20,895
It doesn't matter.

882
00:35:20,968 --> 00:35:23,169
I'm done with him anyway.

883
00:35:23,234 --> 00:35:24,740
I'm so sorry.

884
00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:36,137
Rachel that was amazing.

885
00:35:36,138 --> 00:35:37,831
- Thank you, Louis.
- We're gonna win.

886
00:35:38,013 --> 00:35:41,748
You did win.

887
00:35:41,813 --> 00:35:44,686
Don't worry.
I'm not going to take your cat.

888
00:35:44,751 --> 00:35:45,981
I am a man of honor.

889
00:35:46,054 --> 00:35:47,589
Well, that's very gracious
of you.

890
00:35:47,654 --> 00:35:49,189
In fact, I'm glad
we had this trial

891
00:35:49,254 --> 00:35:50,894
because you and I both know
you didn't win

892
00:35:50,958 --> 00:35:51,990
on the merits
of the case.

893
00:35:52,063 --> 00:35:54,200
You won because
the associates prefer

894
00:35:54,265 --> 00:35:58,398
your tough love
to my light touch.

895
00:35:58,462 --> 00:36:01,837
- Yeah, they do.
- But Mikado belongs with me.

896
00:36:01,902 --> 00:36:03,301
And this trial showed me
there's something

897
00:36:03,374 --> 00:36:06,269
you care about
more than her.

898
00:36:06,342 --> 00:36:08,573
- Nothing.
- Yes.

899
00:36:08,646 --> 00:36:12,075
The associates.

900
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:16,180
I'm offering you
a settlement.

901
00:36:16,245 --> 00:36:17,180
No.

902
00:36:17,253 --> 00:36:20,555
You get back
the associates.

903
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:24,386
I get back my cat.
No.

904
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:26,388
II need a moment to confer
with my client.

905
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:29,592
Of course.

906
00:36:32,424 --> 00:36:36,170
I do love her, you know?

907
00:36:47,177 --> 00:36:50,819
Louis, as your attorney,
I need to say this...

908
00:36:50,884 --> 00:36:53,752
Please don't
make me choose.

909
00:36:53,817 --> 00:36:56,489
She's Nigel's cat.

910
00:36:58,386 --> 00:37:00,226
You were right.

911
00:37:00,291 --> 00:37:01,596
No one's ever going
to believe

912
00:37:01,661 --> 00:37:04,427
that Ava didn't know
what her number two was up to.

913
00:37:04,499 --> 00:37:06,194
It was worth trying.

914
00:37:06,267 --> 00:37:09,501
It was worth trying
because she really didn't know.

915
00:37:09,574 --> 00:37:11,640
And no one's ever going
to believe it

916
00:37:11,713 --> 00:37:12,977
because she should've known.

917
00:37:13,043 --> 00:37:16,545
Jessica, Ava and Nick
are not the same as you and me.

918
00:37:16,618 --> 00:37:20,452
I know.
They're not.

919
00:37:20,525 --> 00:37:22,958
She didn't wanna know what was
happening under her nose.

920
00:37:23,023 --> 00:37:23,958
I do.

921
00:37:24,031 --> 00:37:24,998
And the only reason

922
00:37:25,063 --> 00:37:26,294
why I didn't see it
this time

923
00:37:26,367 --> 00:37:28,133
is because I never thought
you'd do that to me.

924
00:37:28,198 --> 00:37:30,078
- I didn't do it to you.
- You put it in motion.

925
00:37:30,134 --> 00:37:32,437
And then I stopped it.
And then I told you about it.

926
00:37:32,504 --> 00:37:35,176
What I wanna know
is why.

927
00:37:35,241 --> 00:37:38,111
You coulda just
let it go,

928
00:37:38,176 --> 00:37:40,205
never said a word.

929
00:37:40,278 --> 00:37:42,109
I told you
because enough was enough

930
00:37:42,182 --> 00:37:44,415
and I didn't want anymore
secrets between us.

931
00:37:44,481 --> 00:37:46,585
No, when you cheat on someone
and tell them about it,

932
00:37:46,650 --> 00:37:49,321
it's not to make them
feel better.

933
00:37:49,386 --> 00:37:51,793
It's to make yourself
feel better.

934
00:37:51,858 --> 00:37:53,192
Yeah, unless you think
there's a chance

935
00:37:53,257 --> 00:37:54,424
that they're gonna
find out.

936
00:37:54,497 --> 00:37:56,064
Or you think
telling them

937
00:37:56,129 --> 00:37:59,096
is going to make them
wanna get out of their merger.

938
00:37:59,161 --> 00:38:01,233
I guess we've stopped
with the cheating analogy.

939
00:38:01,298 --> 00:38:03,569
Yes, we have.

940
00:38:03,634 --> 00:38:07,040
Now, did you come clean
to heal our relationship

941
00:38:07,105 --> 00:38:10,345
or to make me want out
of the merger?

942
00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:12,880
Like I just
told you,

943
00:38:12,945 --> 00:38:15,543
I did it because I didn't want
to keep anymore secrets.

944
00:38:15,616 --> 00:38:17,151
But I have never kept it
a secret

945
00:38:17,216 --> 00:38:18,814
that I want out
of this merger.

946
00:38:18,886 --> 00:38:20,414
You didn't answer
the question.

947
00:38:20,487 --> 00:38:22,720
Okay, if you're asking
if I knew

948
00:38:22,793 --> 00:38:27,296
that coming clean about Darby
would make you furious with him,

949
00:38:27,361 --> 00:38:28,827
I'd be lying
if I didn't say

950
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:29,835
it crossed my mind.

951
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:31,067
So you set me up.

952
00:38:31,132 --> 00:38:33,036
No, all I did
is what you've taught me to do

953
00:38:33,101 --> 00:38:34,669
for a long time.

954
00:38:34,742 --> 00:38:36,006
And it didn't change
your mind.

955
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:39,943
It just put you in touch
with what you already felt.

956
00:38:43,517 --> 00:38:45,315
You really could be
managing partner.

957
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:47,345
But I'm not.

958
00:38:47,418 --> 00:38:50,954
And I don't
wanna be.

959
00:38:51,019 --> 00:38:55,458
So...

960
00:38:55,523 --> 00:38:59,532
What are we gonna do
about this trial?

961
00:39:00,902 --> 00:39:03,270
As much as Mikado
means to you,

962
00:39:03,335 --> 00:39:05,205
I know the associates
mean more.

963
00:39:05,270 --> 00:39:07,942
No, not more.

964
00:39:08,007 --> 00:39:12,619
The needs of the many outweigh
the needs of one.

965
00:39:12,684 --> 00:39:14,819
- What philosopher said that?
- Spock.

966
00:39:14,884 --> 00:39:17,187
<i>The Wrath of Khan?</i>

967
00:39:17,252 --> 00:39:19,525
I will take her back
to Nigel for you.

968
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:22,928
Well, thanks for doing this
for me, Rachel.

969
00:39:23,001 --> 00:39:26,703
But I want to do something
for you first,

970
00:39:26,768 --> 00:39:31,578
a reward of sorts
for your victory.

971
00:39:31,643 --> 00:39:33,275
See, I was right to pick you
to be my lawyer.

972
00:39:33,347 --> 00:39:37,482
And as it turns out,

973
00:39:37,546 --> 00:39:41,487
Columbia Law School agrees.

974
00:39:41,552 --> 00:39:42,583
Louis, what--

975
00:39:42,649 --> 00:39:43,889
I saw it on mail cart
this morning.

976
00:39:43,954 --> 00:39:46,993
I wanted to save it
for you.

977
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:51,620
Congratulations, Rachel.
You're gonna be a lawyer.

978
00:39:53,693 --> 00:39:54,629
A real lawyer.

979
00:40:01,301 --> 00:40:03,500
- Donna, where's Harvey?
- He's with Jessica.

980
00:40:03,573 --> 00:40:04,667
Where?
They're not in her office.

981
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:05,738
- They're on the roof.
- Okay.

982
00:40:05,803 --> 00:40:06,937
Get them down here
right now.

983
00:40:07,002 --> 00:40:08,104
- Mike, what's wrong?
- I said now.

984
00:40:08,169 --> 00:40:09,569
Mike.

985
00:40:09,642 --> 00:40:10,642
What's wrong?

986
00:40:10,707 --> 00:40:11,746
I know why Stephen needed
to know

987
00:40:11,811 --> 00:40:13,841
what Mariga said
in his deposition.

988
00:40:13,914 --> 00:40:15,208
Why?

989
00:40:15,281 --> 00:40:19,384
He was afraid that Mariga
would tell the truth.

990
00:40:19,449 --> 00:40:23,384
Stephen was the one
who ordered those killings.

991
00:40:31,258 --> 00:40:32,991
Emmanuel Mariga
20 years ago

992
00:40:33,064 --> 00:40:35,564
at the University of Cape Town
as an Econ major.

993
00:40:35,629 --> 00:40:37,059
Always had a head
for business.

994
00:40:37,132 --> 00:40:39,628
He was also
on the rugby team.

995
00:40:39,701 --> 00:40:41,599
You know who else played rugby?
Stephen Huntley.

996
00:40:41,672 --> 00:40:43,472
Stephen's record
from Cambridge included

997
00:40:43,538 --> 00:40:47,541
a semester abroad
at the University of Cape Town.

998
00:40:47,606 --> 00:40:50,474
That year's team.

999
00:40:50,539 --> 00:40:52,577
They had
a hell of a season.

1000
00:40:52,642 --> 00:40:53,945
They're still
a team.

1001
00:40:54,010 --> 00:40:54,945
Darby was clear.

1002
00:40:55,010 --> 00:40:56,145
Whenever he has
a problem,

1003
00:40:56,210 --> 00:40:57,882
Stephen's the one
he sends in to fix it.

1004
00:40:57,947 --> 00:40:59,345
And Ava's problem
was his problem.

1005
00:40:59,418 --> 00:41:01,110
So when she came to him
to get her pipeline built--

1006
00:41:01,183 --> 00:41:02,182
He went to Stephen.

1007
00:41:02,247 --> 00:41:03,118
And you wanna know
what it took

1008
00:41:03,183 --> 00:41:04,349
to set up
those murders?

1009
00:41:04,414 --> 00:41:06,453
One phone call
to Mariga,

1010
00:41:06,519 --> 00:41:08,317
from the offices
of Darby International,

1011
00:41:08,390 --> 00:41:10,620
from Stephen Huntley's
London office.

1012
00:41:10,693 --> 00:41:12,985
From there, Mariga calls Nick,
Nick calls Ava,

1013
00:41:13,058 --> 00:41:14,321
and the whole thing is set
in motion.

1014
00:41:14,386 --> 00:41:15,793
They thought they were paying
for a bribe.

1015
00:41:15,858 --> 00:41:17,056
But they were actually paying
for murder.

1016
00:41:17,121 --> 00:41:18,482
And they never knew
the connection.

1017
00:41:18,488 --> 00:41:20,293
And when Ava's about to be
charged for murder,

1018
00:41:20,358 --> 00:41:23,810
Stephen shows up to make sure
we'd never find out.

1019
00:41:23,861 --> 00:41:27,147
I'm so sorry, harvey.

1020
00:41:34,688 --> 00:41:35,739
Harvey.

1021
00:41:35,823 --> 00:41:38,858
Harvey, what are
you gonna do?

1022
00:42:01,215 --> 00:42:05,068
Ah!

1023
00:42:08,096 --> 00:42:13,096
