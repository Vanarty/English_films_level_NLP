1
00:00:01,383 --> 00:00:02,751
I lost Ava her company.

2
00:00:02,752 --> 00:00:05,099
I assume my deal
with Edward is dead.

3
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:06,970
As long as you win
her murder trial,

4
00:00:07,022 --> 00:00:09,106
you'll be
the next managing partner.

5
00:00:09,157 --> 00:00:10,641
I'm sleeping with Stephen.

6
00:00:10,692 --> 00:00:12,643
I can see that.

7
00:00:12,694 --> 00:00:14,478
So you're not upset?

8
00:00:14,529 --> 00:00:16,864
No.

9
00:00:16,948 --> 00:00:18,482
I got an interview.

10
00:00:18,533 --> 00:00:19,650
Look, I'm sorry, I just didn't
know how to tell you, Mike.

11
00:00:19,701 --> 00:00:21,001
I don't know,
how about,

12
00:00:21,086 --> 00:00:22,787
"hey, Mike, I might go
to law school 3,000 miles away"?

13
00:00:22,838 --> 00:00:26,424
This isn't about me getting
personal with Gianopolous.

14
00:00:26,491 --> 00:00:29,343
This is about me getting
personal with Donna.

15
00:00:29,428 --> 00:00:31,161
Chain of custody is something
I know a little bit about,

16
00:00:31,213 --> 00:00:32,213
thanks to you.

17
00:00:32,297 --> 00:00:33,347
Save yourself
the embarrassment

18
00:00:33,432 --> 00:00:34,665
and cancel this trial.

19
00:00:34,716 --> 00:00:36,600
We're in the ring,
I'm still standing,

20
00:00:36,668 --> 00:00:37,968
and this isn't done.

21
00:00:38,019 --> 00:00:39,837
It's going up
on the wall tomorrow.

22
00:00:39,888 --> 00:00:42,005
And this is your way
of getting me on your side?

23
00:00:42,057 --> 00:00:44,308
I don't want you
on my side.

24
00:00:44,359 --> 00:00:46,477
I want us to be
on the same side.

25
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:54,702
- You look happy.
- Do I?

26
00:00:54,786 --> 00:00:56,704
Why?

27
00:00:56,788 --> 00:01:00,374
Um, I don't know, Donna,
it's hard to explain.

28
00:01:00,459 --> 00:01:01,742
All right,
I'll tell you.

29
00:01:01,827 --> 00:01:03,467
Mikado finally slept
in my bed last night,

30
00:01:03,495 --> 00:01:04,735
and when I woke up
this morning,

31
00:01:04,746 --> 00:01:06,046
it felt like the whole world
was hugging me.

32
00:01:06,131 --> 00:01:07,698
I lost 9 ounces.

33
00:01:07,749 --> 00:01:09,083
My teeth whiteners
are working.

34
00:01:09,167 --> 00:01:11,001
I found five new hairs
on the top of my head.

35
00:01:11,052 --> 00:01:12,670
And to top it all off,
I just found out

36
00:01:12,721 --> 00:01:15,205
that Esther broke her foot
in three places.

37
00:01:15,257 --> 00:01:16,223
Your sister?

38
00:01:16,308 --> 00:01:17,708
Yeah, crutches
for seven months.

39
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:21,211
Serves her right.
Dad's favorite.

40
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:27,718
Mm.

41
00:01:30,522 --> 00:01:32,907
I need a day.

42
00:01:42,567 --> 00:01:44,034
Dom Perignon's on ice

43
00:01:44,085 --> 00:01:45,453
and Bloomberg's
closing Broadway

44
00:01:45,537 --> 00:01:46,904
for the ticker-tape parade.

45
00:01:46,955 --> 00:01:48,756
You saw the sign?

46
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,591
Yeah, dream come true
for any lawyer.

47
00:01:50,675 --> 00:01:52,910
I don't have dreams.
I have goals.

48
00:01:52,961 --> 00:01:55,913
Now it's on
to the next one.

49
00:02:01,219 --> 00:02:02,470
When did you find out?

50
00:02:02,554 --> 00:02:03,554
Last night.

51
00:02:03,605 --> 00:02:04,972
Why didn't you tell me?

52
00:02:05,056 --> 00:02:06,690
I shouldn't have to.

53
00:02:06,758 --> 00:02:08,108
Meaning?

54
00:02:08,193 --> 00:02:10,811
Meaning your focus hasn't
been where it usually is.

55
00:02:10,896 --> 00:02:12,776
Okay, meaning that my focus
has been on Stephen.

56
00:02:12,814 --> 00:02:15,533
If that's what you mean,
then just say it.

57
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,767
Just admit that it bothers you
about me and him.

58
00:02:16,818 --> 00:02:18,268
I'm not admitting anything

59
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,870
because there's nothing
to admit.

60
00:02:19,938 --> 00:02:22,289
And Stephen or not,
you know as well as I do

61
00:02:22,374 --> 00:02:23,791
I've never had
to tell you a thing.

62
00:02:23,875 --> 00:02:26,210
You've always just known.

63
00:02:28,413 --> 00:02:30,798
- You've had too much coffee.
- What are you talking about?

64
00:02:30,882 --> 00:02:32,166
After two cups,
your signature slants.

65
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:33,300
After three,
it scrawls.

66
00:02:33,385 --> 00:02:34,885
And after four,
it's chicken scratch.

67
00:02:34,953 --> 00:02:36,153
They're not gonna
accept these.

68
00:02:36,221 --> 00:02:37,221
You're crazy.

69
00:02:37,288 --> 00:02:38,138
How many cups
have you had today?

70
00:02:38,223 --> 00:02:39,957
Five.

71
00:02:40,008 --> 00:02:41,792
How'd you do that?

72
00:02:41,843 --> 00:02:43,143
It's what I do.

73
00:02:43,228 --> 00:02:46,630
I read, I analyze, I fix.

74
00:02:46,681 --> 00:02:48,933
Bullshit.

75
00:02:50,685 --> 00:02:51,819
You're wearing
a blue shirt,

76
00:02:51,903 --> 00:02:53,487
which means you won big
in poker last night.

77
00:02:53,572 --> 00:02:54,939
You missed a spot shaving,

78
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:56,774
which means you had
less than five hours of sleep.

79
00:02:56,825 --> 00:02:58,108
And your left wrist,

80
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:01,278
which you claim you sprained
playing basketball,

81
00:03:01,329 --> 00:03:02,997
still hasn't healed
because your loud tie is hanging

82
00:03:03,081 --> 00:03:05,366
ever so slightly
to the left.

83
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:08,118
Loud, by the way, because
you won big in poker last night.

84
00:03:08,169 --> 00:03:09,336
For your information,

85
00:03:09,421 --> 00:03:11,321
I didn't lose sleep
just because of poker.

86
00:03:11,373 --> 00:03:13,657
Yeah, you did.

87
00:03:13,708 --> 00:03:14,875
Melanie's not
in the picture anymore.

88
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,844
- You knew about Melanie?
- And Charlotte.

89
00:03:16,928 --> 00:03:18,629
And Nadia.

90
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,598
Okay, I don't want you
working for me anymore.

91
00:03:20,665 --> 00:03:22,833
Harvey, stop playing
footsie with your secretary.

92
00:03:22,884 --> 00:03:24,435
Mackenzie brothers
are here.

93
00:03:24,502 --> 00:03:26,220
We need to get
these assholes to cave.

94
00:03:26,304 --> 00:03:29,339
I had an idea.
Nite owl murders.

95
00:03:29,391 --> 00:03:31,475
We're not using an idea
you got from <i>L.A. Confidential.</i>

96
00:03:31,526 --> 00:03:33,561
How is that different
from you shooting a dead guy

97
00:03:33,645 --> 00:03:35,729
just because Sean Connery
did it in <i>The Untouchables?</i>

98
00:03:35,814 --> 00:03:37,681
What are you prepared to do?

99
00:03:37,732 --> 00:03:39,617
Is that supposed
to be Sean Connery?

100
00:03:39,684 --> 00:03:42,486
Don't even think that you
can do Connery better than me.

101
00:03:42,537 --> 00:03:45,322
Junior.

102
00:03:45,373 --> 00:03:46,707
He's a lying member

103
00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:48,709
of a no-good race.

104
00:03:48,793 --> 00:03:50,578
Ease up, James Bond.

105
00:03:50,662 --> 00:03:51,829
So you gonna come out
and say it?

106
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:52,830
Say what?

107
00:03:52,881 --> 00:03:55,249
All those observations.

108
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:57,251
You're into me.

109
00:03:59,087 --> 00:04:01,005
I'm not into you.
I'm Donna.

110
00:04:01,056 --> 00:04:02,339
What's that
supposed to mean?

111
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:03,257
It means I could do
the same thing with Bertha

112
00:04:03,341 --> 00:04:04,541
that I did with you.

113
00:04:04,593 --> 00:04:06,427
All that means is that
you're into Bertha too.

114
00:04:06,511 --> 00:04:07,595
Ooh, what if I am?

115
00:04:07,679 --> 00:04:09,379
We can have
a threesome.

116
00:04:09,431 --> 00:04:12,182
Trust me, if you were ever
lucky enough to have me,

117
00:04:12,233 --> 00:04:15,185
you wouldn't want to share.

118
00:04:22,944 --> 00:04:24,945
Dude, you gonna share
that shit with me or what?

119
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:26,614
Negatory.

120
00:04:26,698 --> 00:04:27,948
Mmhmm.

121
00:04:28,033 --> 00:04:29,783
All right, you can have some,
but take it easy.

122
00:04:29,868 --> 00:04:31,418
It's gotta last
until tomorrow.

123
00:04:31,503 --> 00:04:33,070
I thought you had
3 ounces.

124
00:04:33,121 --> 00:04:35,739
I sold it.
Daddy's gotta eat.

125
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:36,757
Wait a minute,
you're dealing now?

126
00:04:36,841 --> 00:04:37,958
Friends and family,
asshole.

127
00:04:38,043 --> 00:04:39,710
What are you, AT&T?

128
00:04:39,761 --> 00:04:41,095
What are you, the FCC?

129
00:04:41,179 --> 00:04:43,263
You don't even know
what that is.

130
00:04:43,348 --> 00:04:44,548
- Yes, I do.
- Really?

131
00:04:44,599 --> 00:04:47,551
Tell me what they do.
I'll give you $500.

132
00:04:47,602 --> 00:04:48,936
You're a dick.

133
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:50,771
A dick who just got
a hundred on his Calc midterm.

134
00:04:50,855 --> 00:04:52,940
You got the results back
already?

135
00:04:53,024 --> 00:04:54,391
No, but trust me,
hundred.

136
00:04:54,442 --> 00:04:55,893
You know who else
thinks you're a dick?

137
00:04:55,944 --> 00:04:57,260
That math test.

138
00:04:57,312 --> 00:04:58,929
Well, that's fine,
because I just made it my bitch.

139
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:02,099
Up top, mother flecker!

140
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:03,817
Whoa, you're gonna
leave me hanging?

141
00:05:03,902 --> 00:05:07,905
Like you're gonna
leave me hanging?

142
00:05:07,956 --> 00:05:10,040
You got into Harvard,
dickhead.

143
00:05:13,712 --> 00:05:15,079
They accepted
my transfer?

144
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:16,580
Yeah, they did.

145
00:05:16,631 --> 00:05:18,415
Holy goddamn shit.

146
00:05:18,466 --> 00:05:21,468
Wait a minute,
you read my mail?

147
00:05:21,553 --> 00:05:22,670
What's the point
of going through it

148
00:05:22,754 --> 00:05:24,471
if I'm not gonna read it?
I hate you.

149
00:05:24,556 --> 00:05:27,457
Yeah, mother flecker!

150
00:05:27,509 --> 00:05:28,926
Holy shit, dude.

151
00:05:28,977 --> 00:05:32,012
We gotta celebrate.
Yeah.

152
00:05:32,097 --> 00:05:34,264
Those douche bags over
at A.E. Pi are having a party.

153
00:05:34,315 --> 00:05:35,298
It's on.

154
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:36,734
It's still on.

155
00:05:36,801 --> 00:05:38,018
There's a reason Cameron
hasn't raised the white flag

156
00:05:38,103 --> 00:05:39,269
with Ava yet.

157
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,571
What is it?

158
00:05:40,638 --> 00:05:42,305
I was filing our motion
to dismiss

159
00:05:42,357 --> 00:05:44,108
when I noticed his office
faxed the court

160
00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:45,325
from the Waldorf Astoria.

161
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:47,494
He's been booking rooms
all over Manhattan.

162
00:05:47,579 --> 00:05:49,113
And turns out
two days ago,

163
00:05:49,164 --> 00:05:50,748
he also called in
the U.S. Marshals.

164
00:05:50,815 --> 00:05:52,166
Protective custody.

165
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:54,752
- 20 men strong.
- Shit.

166
00:05:54,819 --> 00:05:55,986
This case isn't over.

167
00:05:56,037 --> 00:05:58,355

another goddamn witness.

178
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,662
Rachel, come on,
let's just sit down,

179
00:06:34,663 --> 00:06:36,460
for ten minutes, please.
This is ridiculous.

180
00:06:36,461 --> 00:06:37,770
I can't.
I don't wanna miss my flight.

181
00:06:37,771 --> 00:06:38,821
You're not gonna
miss your flight.

182
00:06:38,906 --> 00:06:40,439
It doesn't leave
for another three hours.

183
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:41,824
And you're supposed
to be there two hours before,

184
00:06:41,909 --> 00:06:43,142
and the airport's
an hour away.

185
00:06:43,193 --> 00:06:44,527
And you know what, instead
of giving me a hard time

186
00:06:44,611 --> 00:06:46,312
about my travel habits,

187
00:06:46,363 --> 00:06:48,614
it'd be nice if you'd just
come with me to the airport.

188
00:06:48,665 --> 00:06:50,316
Rachel, you know the case
I'm working on,

189
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:52,501
you know the deadline,
and you know the stakes.

190
00:06:52,586 --> 00:06:53,986
What I know is you don't
want me to visit Stanford

191
00:06:54,037 --> 00:06:55,671
because you don't want me
to go to Stanford.

192
00:06:55,756 --> 00:06:57,506
I never said that.

193
00:06:57,591 --> 00:06:59,175
I just said I wish you had
told me that you had applied.

194
00:06:59,259 --> 00:07:01,043
Well, I did,
and now you're being shitty

195
00:07:01,128 --> 00:07:02,368
because you don't
want me to go,

196
00:07:02,379 --> 00:07:03,713
and you won't even
just admit it.

197
00:07:03,797 --> 00:07:05,164
Look, do you really want this
to be easy for me?

198
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:07,133
All I wanted is for you
to tell me

199
00:07:07,184 --> 00:07:10,169
to have a good trip
and to mean it.

200
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:18,945
Have a good trip.

201
00:07:30,874 --> 00:07:33,459
Okay, you're telling me
that if I can guess

202
00:07:33,526 --> 00:07:38,164
your exact birthday,
you will kiss me right here.

203
00:07:38,215 --> 00:07:41,384
If you can guess
my birthday,

204
00:07:41,468 --> 00:07:42,668
I'll kiss you...

205
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:46,205
Wow.

206
00:07:46,256 --> 00:07:48,307
That is very detailed.

207
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:50,509
All right,
I'm ready to get started.

208
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,094
Uh, I need 360--

209
00:07:52,179 --> 00:07:53,780
I'm sorry, I gotta borrow
my friend here.

210
00:07:53,814 --> 00:07:55,348
I need to borrow my friend
just for a second.

211
00:07:55,399 --> 00:07:56,715
No, no, Trevor, 'cause we're
right in the middle of a thing.

212
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:58,267
I'm doing the birthday thing.
What are you doing?

213
00:07:58,352 --> 00:08:00,072
I just found out
behind that door over there

214
00:08:00,153 --> 00:08:02,721
is a poker game filled
with drunk A.E. Pi brothers.

215
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:04,240
No way!
Yeah, that's a great idea.

216
00:08:04,324 --> 00:08:06,392
I should totally not pursue
this hot girl.

217
00:08:06,443 --> 00:08:07,827
Dude, whatever,
you're always telling me

218
00:08:07,894 --> 00:08:08,911
you're Mr. <i>rounders.</i>

219
00:08:08,996 --> 00:08:10,079
Let's go take
their money.

220
00:08:10,163 --> 00:08:11,230
Come on,
we're here to drink booze

221
00:08:11,281 --> 00:08:12,564
and hit on chicks,

222
00:08:12,616 --> 00:08:14,867
not sit in the dark
and play with a bunch of dudes.

223
00:08:14,918 --> 00:08:17,953
Come on, now where was--

224
00:08:18,038 --> 00:08:19,121
what?

225
00:08:19,206 --> 00:08:20,589
Totally not cool, man.

226
00:08:20,674 --> 00:08:22,758
- Of her or of you?
- Whatever.

227
00:08:22,843 --> 00:08:25,244
Whoa, hey, excuse me.

228
00:08:25,295 --> 00:08:27,213
Our house, our rules,
asshole.

229
00:08:27,264 --> 00:08:28,464
Oh!

230
00:08:28,548 --> 00:08:29,715
Douche bag.

231
00:08:29,766 --> 00:08:31,100
Man, forget him.

232
00:08:31,184 --> 00:08:32,968
Nah, I can't.

233
00:08:33,053 --> 00:08:35,421
First week freshman year,
I was playing basketball.

234
00:08:35,472 --> 00:08:36,422
He showed up with three
of his buddies.

235
00:08:36,473 --> 00:08:38,190
I go up for a lay-up,

236
00:08:38,258 --> 00:08:40,526
he comes in,
lays me out.

237
00:08:40,593 --> 00:08:41,944
Stands over me and says,

238
00:08:42,029 --> 00:08:44,430
"What are you gonna
do about it?"

239
00:08:44,481 --> 00:08:47,266
I let it go.

240
00:08:47,317 --> 00:08:49,768
I'm not letting it go
this time.

241
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,237
Let's roll.

242
00:08:53,073 --> 00:08:53,989
You wanted to see me?

243
00:08:54,074 --> 00:08:57,243
Mackenzie brothers.

244
00:08:58,545 --> 00:09:00,279
I got 'em 25 years apiece.

245
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:01,613
You?

246
00:09:01,665 --> 00:09:03,449
You wouldn't have gotten shit
without me.

247
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,668
Nite owl murders, baby.

248
00:09:05,752 --> 00:09:07,136
Oh, don't do that.

249
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:09,472
What kind of person doesn't
high-five another person?

250
00:09:09,556 --> 00:09:11,173
A person
who's not ten years old.

251
00:09:11,258 --> 00:09:13,125
Oh, so you mean
like a dick.

252
00:09:13,176 --> 00:09:16,095
No, I mean, like the guy
that can fire you on the spot.

253
00:09:16,146 --> 00:09:19,014
Nite owl murders, baby.

254
00:09:19,099 --> 00:09:20,900
All right, okay, okay.

255
00:09:20,967 --> 00:09:24,470
All kidding aside,
great job.

256
00:09:24,521 --> 00:09:25,688
Thank you.

257
00:09:25,772 --> 00:09:26,689
That's not
why I called you down here.

258
00:09:26,773 --> 00:09:29,141
Look, Harvey,

259
00:09:29,192 --> 00:09:31,077
you're killing it,
and you've been killing it,

260
00:09:31,144 --> 00:09:32,811
and I think it's time
that you got rewarded for it.

261
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:34,413
Head litigator.

262
00:09:34,481 --> 00:09:37,199
Look, I know you got a deal
with Jessica to come back,

263
00:09:37,284 --> 00:09:39,285
but I'm telling you,
in ten years, you could be me.

264
00:09:39,336 --> 00:09:41,370
You think about it.

265
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:44,790
In the meantime,
celebrate the win.

266
00:09:48,628 --> 00:09:51,514
Just stay away
from my scotch.

267
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:54,934
Well, I guess
I win again.

268
00:09:55,001 --> 00:09:57,520
You guys are really
behind the times.

269
00:09:57,604 --> 00:09:59,004
You ought to be playing
hold'em.

270
00:09:59,055 --> 00:10:00,506
Don't give a shit
about moneymaker

271
00:10:00,557 --> 00:10:01,807
and his bullshit game.

272
00:10:01,858 --> 00:10:03,309
We're old school.
We play stud.

273
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,676
You lose at stud.

274
00:10:04,728 --> 00:10:06,695
Not to you, asshole.

275
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:09,982
No, no, no, no,
you lose to me.

276
00:10:10,033 --> 00:10:13,035
Come on, hurry up, old school.
Deal the cards.

277
00:10:15,572 --> 00:10:18,524
Compliments
of Cameron Dennis.

278
00:10:22,662 --> 00:10:24,663
Harvey, this isn't
just winning a case.

279
00:10:24,714 --> 00:10:26,549
This is head litigator.

280
00:10:26,633 --> 00:10:27,800
Scotch isn't good enough.

281
00:10:27,867 --> 00:10:29,701
We need, like, a ritual
or something.

282
00:10:29,753 --> 00:10:31,504
What did you have in mind?

283
00:10:31,555 --> 00:10:33,672
I don't know.

284
00:10:33,723 --> 00:10:34,890
I have an idea.

285
00:10:34,975 --> 00:10:36,675
I'm listening.

286
00:10:36,726 --> 00:10:38,726
It's not something
a gentleman should say out loud.

287
00:10:38,762 --> 00:10:41,147
Oh, well,
then I'm willing to pretend

288
00:10:41,214 --> 00:10:43,682
that you're a gentleman.

289
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:50,573
Okay, you are definitely
not a gentleman.

290
00:10:50,657 --> 00:10:52,942
What would we even
do it with?

291
00:10:53,026 --> 00:10:54,393
Whipped cream.

292
00:10:56,329 --> 00:10:57,896
Enough about
this conversation.

293
00:10:57,948 --> 00:10:59,782
I want to revisit
our earlier one.

294
00:10:59,866 --> 00:11:02,785
This is our earlier one.

295
00:11:02,869 --> 00:11:05,538
Come on, you know
you've thought about it.

296
00:11:05,589 --> 00:11:07,406
Yeah, I think
about a lot of things.

297
00:11:07,457 --> 00:11:09,542
And you would.

298
00:11:09,593 --> 00:11:12,011
But I won't.

299
00:11:12,078 --> 00:11:13,579
You're afraid
you'd fall for me.

300
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:15,390
Oh, please, if anybody's
falling for anybody,

301
00:11:15,432 --> 00:11:16,932
it would be you for me.

302
00:11:17,017 --> 00:11:18,934
Sounds like a challenge.

303
00:11:19,019 --> 00:11:20,603
One you are never
gonna get to take.

304
00:11:20,687 --> 00:11:22,304
Why not?

305
00:11:22,389 --> 00:11:24,640
'Cause I don't get involved
with men that I work with.

306
00:11:24,724 --> 00:11:26,308
Okay, then you're fired.

307
00:11:26,393 --> 00:11:27,759
'Bout time.

308
00:11:27,811 --> 00:11:29,228
What did I ever
do to you?

309
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,730
Nothing.
I get your chair.

310
00:11:31,781 --> 00:11:33,532
Bertha, what are you
doing here so late?

311
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,817
Don't get all up
in my business

312
00:11:34,901 --> 00:11:37,152
just because I interrupted you
hitting on red.

313
00:11:37,237 --> 00:11:38,904
How do you know
I'm hitting on her?

314
00:11:38,955 --> 00:11:41,156
Two glasses of scotch
and you.

315
00:11:41,241 --> 00:11:43,993
I found a Mackenzie file
in the MacAllister box.

316
00:11:44,077 --> 00:11:45,578
You're welcome.

317
00:11:45,629 --> 00:11:48,047
And you better get
Dennis his scotch back.

318
00:11:48,114 --> 00:11:50,633
He won't like that.

319
00:11:50,717 --> 00:11:52,117
Shit.

320
00:11:52,168 --> 00:11:53,335
What's wrong?

321
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:55,504
We left out
a piece of discovery.

322
00:11:55,589 --> 00:11:56,589
Will it screw us?

323
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,957
It just did.

324
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:01,960
Well, I raise.

325
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:03,395
500.

326
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,685
Call and raise
another 500.

327
00:12:09,769 --> 00:12:13,188
I don't have
another 500, so...

328
00:12:13,273 --> 00:12:15,691
Wait a second.
He might.

329
00:12:17,077 --> 00:12:18,810
I have another thousand
on me.

330
00:12:18,862 --> 00:12:20,195
How do you have
another thousand?

331
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,313
From the weed.

332
00:12:21,364 --> 00:12:23,165
I told you,
I got rid of it.

333
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:26,919
Now do you have this guy
or not?

334
00:12:26,986 --> 00:12:28,370
I got kings full of 2s.

335
00:12:28,455 --> 00:12:30,039
He's got no aces showing,

336
00:12:30,123 --> 00:12:32,824
and <i>Jesus Christ Superstar</i>
folded one on first street.

337
00:12:32,876 --> 00:12:33,992
The only way he beats me

338
00:12:34,044 --> 00:12:35,661
is with trip 3s or trip 4s
under there,

339
00:12:35,712 --> 00:12:37,463
and Limp Bizkit
folded two 3s,

340
00:12:37,514 --> 00:12:40,049
and Dickcheese over here
had a 4.

341
00:12:40,133 --> 00:12:42,518
So he's got a...

342
00:12:42,602 --> 00:12:43,852
- A straight.
- Straight.

343
00:12:43,937 --> 00:12:44,887
Or he's bluffing,

344
00:12:44,971 --> 00:12:46,138
but either way,
I got him.

345
00:12:46,189 --> 00:12:47,473
Hey, do you always get
your girlfriend's advice

346
00:12:47,524 --> 00:12:48,724
on everything?

347
00:12:48,808 --> 00:12:50,676
Oh, this guy.

348
00:12:50,727 --> 00:12:53,195
Well, let's raise
another 500.

349
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,480
Hmm.

350
00:12:54,531 --> 00:12:57,066
Don't ask for more
unless you wanna lose it.

351
00:13:05,241 --> 00:13:06,191
Call.

352
00:13:06,242 --> 00:13:08,661
Full house.

353
00:13:12,248 --> 00:13:13,415
Four 4s, asshole.

354
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,084
Whoa, wait.
Wait, that's not possible.

355
00:13:15,168 --> 00:13:16,201
He had--

356
00:13:16,252 --> 00:13:18,137
he's cheating.

357
00:13:20,507 --> 00:13:22,675
And what are you
gonna do about it?

358
00:13:22,726 --> 00:13:24,876
You're not gonna get away
with this.

359
00:13:24,928 --> 00:13:26,545
Well, I guess
your only option

360
00:13:26,596 --> 00:13:28,764
would be
to call the police.

361
00:13:28,848 --> 00:13:30,209
Of course,
I haven't been drinking,

362
00:13:30,216 --> 00:13:32,351
'cause, you know,
I'm underage, like you boys.

363
00:13:32,402 --> 00:13:33,352
You set us up.

364
00:13:33,403 --> 00:13:35,521
Yeah.

365
00:13:35,572 --> 00:13:37,189
See, I remember you.

366
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,741
First week,
you come into class,

367
00:13:38,825 --> 00:13:40,892
Mr. "Oh, I got
the whole textbook memorized."

368
00:13:40,944 --> 00:13:42,528
Made the rest of us
look like chumps.

369
00:13:42,579 --> 00:13:44,279
No, you did that
all by yourself.

370
00:13:44,364 --> 00:13:45,664
Yeah, well,
I don't need a super brain

371
00:13:45,732 --> 00:13:47,282
to remember some guy who thinks
his shit don't stink.

372
00:13:47,367 --> 00:13:48,283
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, dude.
- Hey, back up.

373
00:13:48,368 --> 00:13:49,501
Now get the hell outta here

374
00:13:49,569 --> 00:13:52,254
before we put you
out of here.

375
00:14:04,028 --> 00:14:05,377
Congratulations Harvey.

376
00:14:05,672 --> 00:14:07,467
I had no idea
Jessica was planning this.

377
00:14:07,628 --> 00:14:08,945
What do you want, Stephen?

378
00:14:09,097 --> 00:14:11,231
I hear Cameron
got a witness.

379
00:14:11,315 --> 00:14:13,767
He did.
What do you want?

380
00:14:13,851 --> 00:14:15,018
I'm just checking to see

381
00:14:15,069 --> 00:14:16,269
if there's anything
I can do to help.

382
00:14:16,354 --> 00:14:18,721
There isn't.

383
00:14:18,773 --> 00:14:21,575
Cheers.

384
00:14:23,327 --> 00:14:24,361
What do you got?

385
00:14:24,428 --> 00:14:25,445
I couldn't find out

386
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:27,080
where Cameron's
got his witness hidden,

387
00:14:27,165 --> 00:14:30,083
but I figured out
who it is.

388
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:34,070
What?

389
00:14:34,122 --> 00:14:35,839
So now I know
why you wanted to meet me

390
00:14:35,906 --> 00:14:37,874
at the elevator.

391
00:14:37,925 --> 00:14:39,376
Pretty awesome.

392
00:14:39,427 --> 00:14:40,844
Yeah, it is.

393
00:14:40,911 --> 00:14:42,846
What are you gonna do
about Jessica?

394
00:14:42,913 --> 00:14:44,848
I don't know.

395
00:14:54,475 --> 00:14:56,643
Nothing ever changes
around here.

396
00:14:56,727 --> 00:14:59,196
It's good to see you too,
Harvey.

397
00:14:59,263 --> 00:15:02,566
Now what was so important
that you just had to see me?

398
00:15:02,617 --> 00:15:04,767
I wanna talk to you
about extending my time

399
00:15:04,819 --> 00:15:08,321
at the D.A.'s office.

400
00:15:08,406 --> 00:15:10,490
Come with me.

401
00:15:10,575 --> 00:15:13,376
Now what's Cameron Dennis
offering you?

402
00:15:13,444 --> 00:15:16,079
Why does he have
to be offering me something?

403
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:19,833
Because he knows, if you wanna
keep someone in your house,

404
00:15:19,917 --> 00:15:22,802
offer them
a better room.

405
00:15:22,887 --> 00:15:25,138
Head litigator.

406
00:15:25,223 --> 00:15:27,641
Do you wanna stay there
because it's a step up

407
00:15:27,725 --> 00:15:30,760
or because you can see yourself
there in ten years?

408
00:15:30,811 --> 00:15:32,179
Why do you wanna know?

409
00:15:32,263 --> 00:15:34,598
Because I have a promotion
ready for you right here.

410
00:15:34,649 --> 00:15:36,299
What are you talking about?

411
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:38,902
Daniel Hardman and I

412
00:15:38,969 --> 00:15:41,988
are taking Gordon, Schmidt,
and Van Dyke down.

413
00:15:42,073 --> 00:15:43,773
That's why we're up here.

414
00:15:43,824 --> 00:15:45,692
Did you think
we were gonna make out?

415
00:15:45,776 --> 00:15:48,078
Man can hope.

416
00:15:49,146 --> 00:15:50,363
What?

417
00:15:50,448 --> 00:15:52,832
Are you sure you wanna
take control in the night?

418
00:15:52,917 --> 00:15:54,834
Nighttime's
when they're sleeping.

419
00:15:54,919 --> 00:15:56,786
Telling them you're coming
shows them respect.

420
00:15:56,837 --> 00:15:59,122
Not telling them
shows them more.

421
00:15:59,173 --> 00:16:00,290
What about honor?

422
00:16:00,341 --> 00:16:03,260
Harvey, we're lawyers.

423
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:06,513
We're not
in the honor business.

424
00:16:08,766 --> 00:16:10,217
What did I always tell you
when you were here?

425
00:16:10,301 --> 00:16:12,686
Don't judge a man till you've
walked a mile in his shoes.

426
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:14,938
Well, if you're ever
in these babies,

427
00:16:15,005 --> 00:16:19,609
we'll see if you feel
the same way.

428
00:16:24,365 --> 00:16:25,845
It's a little early
for batting cages,

429
00:16:25,849 --> 00:16:26,866
don't you think?

430
00:16:26,951 --> 00:16:27,984
I'm not going
to the batting cages,

431
00:16:28,035 --> 00:16:29,018
and you know it.

432
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:30,070
Trevor, let it go.

433
00:16:30,154 --> 00:16:31,705
I can't.
I need that money back.

434
00:16:31,789 --> 00:16:33,189
What did you do?

435
00:16:33,241 --> 00:16:35,625
I haven't paid
for the weed yet.

436
00:16:38,195 --> 00:16:40,363
You took a loan
from a drug dealer?

437
00:16:40,414 --> 00:16:41,698
It's called consignment.

438
00:16:41,749 --> 00:16:43,533
Did you ever learn about
free enterprise in Econ 1a?

439
00:16:43,584 --> 00:16:45,418
No, but I read about
not betting money I don't have

440
00:16:45,503 --> 00:16:46,586
in Econ 1a.

441
00:16:46,671 --> 00:16:48,388
You told me you had him,
smart guy.

442
00:16:48,472 --> 00:16:50,090
I did have him,
and you know I did.

443
00:16:50,174 --> 00:16:52,759
Well, I need
a thousand dollars by Monday,

444
00:16:52,843 --> 00:16:54,511
or Omar's gonna beat
the living shit outta me.

445
00:16:54,562 --> 00:16:56,596
Trevor,
him kicking your ass

446
00:16:56,681 --> 00:16:58,265
doesn't get him
his money any faster.

447
00:16:58,349 --> 00:16:59,549
He's not gonna
see it that way.

448
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,768
Okay, then we will think
of something else.

449
00:17:01,852 --> 00:17:03,320
I've been thinking,

450
00:17:03,387 --> 00:17:05,438
and the only thing
I came up with

451
00:17:05,523 --> 00:17:06,573
you're not gonna like.

452
00:17:06,657 --> 00:17:08,057
Why do I
have to like it?

453
00:17:08,109 --> 00:17:11,695
Because I can't do it.

454
00:17:11,746 --> 00:17:12,746
I told you before,

455
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:14,698
I'm not selling
any test answers.

456
00:17:14,749 --> 00:17:16,899
It's not any test.
It's the test you just aced.

457
00:17:16,951 --> 00:17:19,452
It's not out there yet.
Nobody has it.

458
00:17:19,537 --> 00:17:22,956
I can make us 1,000 bucks
in one shot.

459
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,291
Tell me you haven't memorized

460
00:17:24,375 --> 00:17:28,378
every question
and every answer, Harvard boy.

461
00:17:28,429 --> 00:17:29,746
That's what this is about,
isn't it?

462
00:17:29,797 --> 00:17:31,765
So what if it is?

463
00:17:31,849 --> 00:17:32,882
Look, you're bolting,

464
00:17:32,933 --> 00:17:34,417
and you're using
your brain to do it.

465
00:17:34,468 --> 00:17:35,585
I'm just asking,

466
00:17:35,636 --> 00:17:38,421
before you go,
use it to help me.

467
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:42,258
Please.

468
00:17:48,566 --> 00:17:49,733
What the hell is this?

469
00:17:49,784 --> 00:17:51,318
It's the paperwork
for the Mackenzie deal.

470
00:17:51,402 --> 00:17:52,569
Type it up
and get it out.

471
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:54,537
No, that report was
supposed to be disclosed

472
00:17:54,605 --> 00:17:55,622
during discovery.

473
00:17:55,706 --> 00:17:57,290
If you type up
what I gave you,

474
00:17:57,375 --> 00:17:59,125
you'd know
I'm disclosing it now.

475
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:01,444
No, you're sticking it
in there now

476
00:18:01,495 --> 00:18:02,829
as if it's always been there.

477
00:18:02,913 --> 00:18:04,631
It's called bluffing.

478
00:18:04,715 --> 00:18:06,333
Okay, it's what I do.

479
00:18:06,417 --> 00:18:07,917
That's how I got the confession
in the first place.

480
00:18:07,968 --> 00:18:10,303
It's called bullshit,
it's what bullshitters do,

481
00:18:10,388 --> 00:18:12,472
and it's how innocent people
sometimes end up in prison.

482
00:18:12,556 --> 00:18:14,224
- Watch yourself.
- Excuse me?

483
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:16,092
That toxicology report
doesn't change the fact

484
00:18:16,143 --> 00:18:17,811
that those two assholes
killed that woman.

485
00:18:17,895 --> 00:18:19,262
And you being
an asshole to me

486
00:18:19,313 --> 00:18:21,014
doesn't change the fact
that you are breaking the law.

487
00:18:21,098 --> 00:18:22,515
I'm not breaking the law.

488
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,017
I put the goddamn thing
in there.

489
00:18:24,101 --> 00:18:26,019
They can find it
if they can think to look.

490
00:18:26,103 --> 00:18:28,471
Harvey,
you are making a huge--

491
00:18:28,522 --> 00:18:30,640
That's enough!

492
00:18:30,691 --> 00:18:32,525
I'm here.
You're here.

493
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:34,778
Do your job.

494
00:18:45,089 --> 00:18:47,090
We know you have a witness.

495
00:18:47,157 --> 00:18:48,541
Surprised it took you
that long.

496
00:18:48,626 --> 00:18:49,876
And we know who it is.

497
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:52,379
The man from the video,
Colonel Mariga.

498
00:18:52,463 --> 00:18:53,996
I don't have any prizes,

499
00:18:54,048 --> 00:18:56,383
so you'll just have to accept
a pat on the back.

500
00:18:56,467 --> 00:18:58,708
That's okay, Tom Selleck,
I don't need a pat on the back.

501
00:18:58,719 --> 00:19:00,239
I just need to know
what bullshit story

502
00:19:00,271 --> 00:19:01,471
he's gonna tell in court.

503
00:19:01,522 --> 00:19:02,639
It's not bullshit.

504
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:03,890
He's gonna say
that Ava Hessington

505
00:19:03,974 --> 00:19:05,308
paid him to kill
those people.

506
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:06,559
We're getting access
to him.

507
00:19:06,644 --> 00:19:08,561
No, you're not,
because I'm gonna say

508
00:19:08,646 --> 00:19:10,113
if she finds out
where he is,

509
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:11,981
what's to stop her
from killing him too?

510
00:19:12,032 --> 00:19:14,350
You're not gonna bribe him,
you're not gonna threaten him,

511
00:19:14,402 --> 00:19:15,819
and you're not gonna
talk him out of it,

512
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:18,905
because you're not gonna see him
until he gets on the stand.

513
00:19:18,989 --> 00:19:20,824
But what I will do
is allow you

514
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:22,575
to take an offer
to your client.

515
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:24,411
15 years, no parole.

516
00:19:24,495 --> 00:19:25,879
You're bluffing.

517
00:19:25,963 --> 00:19:27,580
He's not gonna say she knew
about the murders,

518
00:19:27,665 --> 00:19:29,866
because she didn't.

519
00:19:29,917 --> 00:19:31,551
I'll tell you what.

520
00:19:31,635 --> 00:19:34,754
Ten years with parole.

521
00:19:34,839 --> 00:19:36,339
Ah, make it nine.

522
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:39,375
After all,
we used to work together.

523
00:19:49,089 --> 00:19:50,936
- How'd it go?
- Don't.

524
00:19:51,501 --> 00:19:52,499
- Was she hot?

525
00:19:52,871 --> 00:19:54,415
I sold her a math test
for $1,000.

526
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:55,666
I wasn't thinking
of whether she was hot or not.

527
00:19:55,751 --> 00:19:57,317
Okay, I get it,
so, like, an eight?

528
00:19:57,369 --> 00:19:59,153
No, a ten wouldn't even
do her justice.

529
00:19:59,204 --> 00:20:00,755
- So six.
- Mm, she's a four.

530
00:20:00,822 --> 00:20:03,007
But she paid me $1,000,
so I bumped her up to a ten.

531
00:20:03,091 --> 00:20:04,158
Got it.

532
00:20:04,209 --> 00:20:06,177
Thank you, Michael.
Came through.

533
00:20:06,261 --> 00:20:07,678
Not yet.

534
00:20:07,763 --> 00:20:09,180
I'm coming with you
to Omar's.

535
00:20:09,264 --> 00:20:10,531
No, no, no, no,
you can't.

536
00:20:10,599 --> 00:20:12,516
Yes, I can.

537
00:20:14,269 --> 00:20:16,053
What's going on?

538
00:20:16,138 --> 00:20:17,471
I owed him the money
yesterday.

539
00:20:17,522 --> 00:20:19,006
How could you not
tell me that?

540
00:20:19,057 --> 00:20:20,775
Because I couldn't make the
test thing happen until today.

541
00:20:20,842 --> 00:20:22,042
I didn't want you
freaking out.

542
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:23,444
Well, I'm definitely
coming with you now,

543
00:20:23,511 --> 00:20:26,781
and the only way you can
stop me is with that bat.

544
00:20:28,116 --> 00:20:30,868
You wanted to see me?

545
00:20:30,952 --> 00:20:32,987
What the hell is this?

546
00:20:33,038 --> 00:20:34,705
- It's the Mackenzie file--
- I know what it is.

547
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:37,024
What the hell did you put
in the fine print?

548
00:20:37,075 --> 00:20:38,492
You too?

549
00:20:38,543 --> 00:20:40,863
You're gonna give me shit about
not disclosing this report?

550
00:20:40,879 --> 00:20:41,996
Not disclosing it?

551
00:20:42,047 --> 00:20:43,998
You gave it to 'em
on a silver platter.

552
00:20:44,049 --> 00:20:46,083
I don't understand.
You want me to take it out?

553
00:20:46,168 --> 00:20:48,052
I don't want you to do shit.
I've already taken it out.

554
00:20:48,136 --> 00:20:49,753
And if I'd wanted it disclosed,

555
00:20:49,838 --> 00:20:51,555
I wouldn't have misfiled it
in the first place.

556
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,673
You buried it?

557
00:20:52,724 --> 00:20:53,891
Damn right I did.

558
00:20:53,975 --> 00:20:56,310
Cameron, look,
I'm all for skirting the law,

559
00:20:56,377 --> 00:20:57,895
but this is
breaking the law.

560
00:20:57,979 --> 00:20:59,180
So was killing that woman,

561
00:20:59,231 --> 00:21:01,048
and I'm not gonna let
those two assholes walk

562
00:21:01,099 --> 00:21:04,051
because our eyewitness had
a few beers at the ball game.

563
00:21:04,102 --> 00:21:05,886
They won't walk. That's why
I put it in the fine print.

564
00:21:05,937 --> 00:21:07,738
You think you're the first guy
to have this idea?

565
00:21:07,823 --> 00:21:09,690
Nobody does it
because it doesn't work.

566
00:21:09,741 --> 00:21:11,192
Well, that's exactly
why it can work.

567
00:21:11,243 --> 00:21:12,827
They won't think
to look at it

568
00:21:12,894 --> 00:21:14,778
because nobody
has the balls to do it.

569
00:21:14,863 --> 00:21:16,396
And what if they do

570
00:21:16,448 --> 00:21:18,749
and these guys get out
and they murder your brother

571
00:21:18,834 --> 00:21:20,117
or your father
or your cousin?

572
00:21:20,202 --> 00:21:21,335
'Cause I'll tell you
right now,

573
00:21:21,402 --> 00:21:23,737
they're gonna
murder someone's.

574
00:21:23,788 --> 00:21:25,422
I don't feel comfortable
with this.

575
00:21:25,507 --> 00:21:27,208
I don't give a shit whether
you feel comfortable or not.

576
00:21:27,259 --> 00:21:28,876
This is my case.
We're not disclosing it.

577
00:21:28,927 --> 00:21:30,344
It's done.
Cameron-

578
00:21:30,411 --> 00:21:32,263
I told you this before.
Don't make me tell you again.

579
00:21:32,347 --> 00:21:33,931
I'm here.
You're here.

580
00:21:34,015 --> 00:21:36,267
Do your job.

581
00:21:41,473 --> 00:21:43,474
- Keep the change.
- I need to speak with you.

582
00:21:43,558 --> 00:21:45,309
Okay, let's talk
on the way up.

583
00:21:45,393 --> 00:21:47,094
No, I prefer
to speak out here.

584
00:21:47,145 --> 00:21:49,613
I know that Cameron's
offered Harvey a deal.

585
00:21:49,698 --> 00:21:51,398
All right, I'm not going
behind Harvey's back.

586
00:21:51,449 --> 00:21:53,067
I don't want you
to go behind his back.

587
00:21:53,118 --> 00:21:54,618
I want you to go
to his face.

588
00:21:54,703 --> 00:21:55,769
And do what?

589
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:56,937
It wasn't a deal.
It was an insult.

590
00:21:56,988 --> 00:21:58,272
It was an opening.

591
00:21:58,323 --> 00:21:59,490
Now he wouldn't
have offered anything

592
00:21:59,574 --> 00:22:00,908
if he wasn't willing
to negotiate.

593
00:22:00,959 --> 00:22:03,077
Maybe we can get him
down to five years.

594
00:22:03,128 --> 00:22:04,295
That's exactly
what he wants,

595
00:22:04,379 --> 00:22:05,629
to put Ava
in a position

596
00:22:05,714 --> 00:22:07,447
where she has to choose
between five years and life.

597
00:22:07,499 --> 00:22:08,999
That's a better position
than she's in now.

598
00:22:09,084 --> 00:22:10,645
He wouldn't have offered
anything at all

599
00:22:10,719 --> 00:22:11,785
if he wasn't bluffing.

600
00:22:11,836 --> 00:22:13,137
We're not gonna fall
for that bluff.

601
00:22:13,221 --> 00:22:14,661
Well, then Harvey's
making a mistake.

602
00:22:14,789 --> 00:22:16,590
Then take it up
with Harvey.

603
00:22:16,657 --> 00:22:18,792
You know as well as I do
Harvey is not interested

604
00:22:18,843 --> 00:22:20,660
in anything I've got to say
at the moment.

605
00:22:20,712 --> 00:22:22,129
You think Harvey's
making this call

606
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:23,997
because of what's going on
between you and Donna?

607
00:22:24,048 --> 00:22:26,350
- It's clouding his judgment.
- Not about this.

608
00:22:26,434 --> 00:22:28,001
Right now
Harvey cannot see reason

609
00:22:28,052 --> 00:22:29,303
with respect to Cameron.

610
00:22:29,354 --> 00:22:31,188
He can't hear reason
with respect to me.

611
00:22:31,272 --> 00:22:32,712
Now you have a chance
to convince him

612
00:22:32,724 --> 00:22:33,974
to make a deal, Mike.

613
00:22:34,025 --> 00:22:36,310
Put yourself
in Ava Hessington's shoes.

614
00:22:36,361 --> 00:22:38,946
Would you want that choice
or not?

615
00:22:43,701 --> 00:22:44,851
Okay, whatever happens,

616
00:22:44,903 --> 00:22:47,704
just be quiet
and be cool.

617
00:22:47,789 --> 00:22:49,823
Okay.

618
00:22:56,881 --> 00:22:57,831
Who this?

619
00:22:57,882 --> 00:23:00,033
My friend.

620
00:23:00,084 --> 00:23:02,052
Hi.

621
00:23:09,144 --> 00:23:11,228
Inside.

622
00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:18,936
Don't move.

623
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:21,555
Where's Omar?

624
00:23:21,606 --> 00:23:22,889
That's Omar.

625
00:23:22,941 --> 00:23:24,391
How is that Omar?

626
00:23:24,442 --> 00:23:26,160
He's obsessed
with <i>The Wire.</i>

627
00:23:27,996 --> 00:23:29,563
Are you kidding me?
Come on.

628
00:23:29,614 --> 00:23:31,248
I'm telling you,
he's no joke.

629
00:23:31,332 --> 00:23:33,092
Yeah, well, I know
I'm supposed to be scared,

630
00:23:33,117 --> 00:23:34,234
but I'm really not.

631
00:23:34,285 --> 00:23:36,336
Don't touch anything.

632
00:23:36,404 --> 00:23:39,923
Now unless my calendar
is messed up,

633
00:23:40,008 --> 00:23:41,258
today be Monday.

634
00:23:41,342 --> 00:23:42,676
- Omar--
- Shut up!

635
00:23:42,743 --> 00:23:44,294
Okay, I'm trying to decide
why I shouldn't call

636
00:23:44,379 --> 00:23:45,963
a couple of hard,
pipe-hitting negroes

637
00:23:46,047 --> 00:23:47,181
to come and work on you

638
00:23:47,248 --> 00:23:49,082
with a pair of pliers
and a blowtorch.

639
00:23:50,718 --> 00:23:52,269
I'm--I'm sorry, Omar.

640
00:23:52,353 --> 00:23:53,720
I don't have a reason,

641
00:23:53,771 --> 00:23:56,306
but I think the word
you be looking for

642
00:23:56,391 --> 00:23:58,475
isn't "negro."

643
00:23:58,560 --> 00:23:59,977
If you're gonna quote
<i>Pulp Fiction,</i>

644
00:24:00,061 --> 00:24:01,979
at least have the balls
to quote <i>Pulp Fiction.</i>

645
00:24:02,063 --> 00:24:04,815
- Omar--
- Shh, shh, shh.

646
00:24:09,037 --> 00:24:10,487
You know what they call
a quarter pounder with cheese

647
00:24:10,572 --> 00:24:11,572
in France?

648
00:24:11,623 --> 00:24:15,792
A royale with cheese,
mother flecker.

649
00:24:15,877 --> 00:24:18,128
- I love this negro!
- Yeah.

650
00:24:18,213 --> 00:24:19,796
Trevor,
you're off the hook.

651
00:24:19,881 --> 00:24:21,615
Never again.

652
00:24:21,666 --> 00:24:23,967
This be for you.

653
00:24:24,052 --> 00:24:26,553
Not white boy.

654
00:24:26,621 --> 00:24:27,838
Go in peace.

655
00:24:27,922 --> 00:24:29,456
- Oh, uh, okay.
- Thanks.

656
00:24:29,507 --> 00:24:30,924
Hey, thank you.

657
00:24:30,975 --> 00:24:32,059
Mmhmm.

658
00:24:32,126 --> 00:24:33,960
Who touched my alien?

659
00:24:35,847 --> 00:24:37,397
What the hell
is wrong with you?

660
00:24:37,465 --> 00:24:38,985
Come on,
it's nothing that some of this

661
00:24:39,067 --> 00:24:40,984
and a royale with cheese
can't fix.

662
00:24:41,069 --> 00:24:42,603
You do not know
what we just avoided.

663
00:24:42,654 --> 00:24:45,239
Just call me the wolf.
I'll be over there directly.

664
00:24:45,306 --> 00:24:46,907
Oh, you sending the wolf?

665
00:24:46,974 --> 00:24:50,994
Oh, shit, negro,
that's all you had to say.

666
00:24:51,079 --> 00:24:52,112
Yo, put that away.

667
00:24:52,163 --> 00:24:53,163
What?
Put what away?

668
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:54,831
If they find it,
it's mine.

669
00:24:54,916 --> 00:24:55,916
Trevor Evans?

670
00:24:55,983 --> 00:24:57,200
Yes, officers.

671
00:24:57,285 --> 00:24:58,318
Come with us.

672
00:24:58,369 --> 00:24:59,620
Hey, what's going on?

673
00:24:59,671 --> 00:25:01,154
Your friend here
seems to be involved

674
00:25:01,205 --> 00:25:04,824
in selling the answers
to a stolen test.

675
00:25:06,177 --> 00:25:07,544
The Mackenzie deal
came back.

676
00:25:07,629 --> 00:25:08,879
Two murderers down.

677
00:25:08,963 --> 00:25:10,923
Don't you wanna ask me
if they saw the fine print?

678
00:25:10,932 --> 00:25:13,350
Oh, no, of course you don't.

679
00:25:13,434 --> 00:25:14,834
Because you know they didn't

680
00:25:14,886 --> 00:25:16,353
because that report wasn't
in the fine print anymore.

681
00:25:16,437 --> 00:25:17,554
Donna--

682
00:25:17,639 --> 00:25:19,056
Cameron made you take it out,
didn't he?

683
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:20,190
How'd you know?

684
00:25:20,275 --> 00:25:21,441
When I do my Donna shit
with you,

685
00:25:21,509 --> 00:25:23,477
it's not just for fun.
It's my job.

686
00:25:23,528 --> 00:25:26,063
Now why don't you tell me
why you didn't tell me?

687
00:25:26,147 --> 00:25:28,065
Because you hated me
when I was working in the gray.

688
00:25:28,149 --> 00:25:30,350
This is the black.
I didn't hate you.

689
00:25:30,401 --> 00:25:32,819
I was trying to stop you.

690
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:34,521
And the truth is
what you were doing

691
00:25:34,572 --> 00:25:35,956
was right on the line.

692
00:25:36,023 --> 00:25:38,375
What he is making you do,
that's illegal.

693
00:25:38,459 --> 00:25:41,044
It's one time,
and it's not my case.

694
00:25:41,129 --> 00:25:42,245
It might not be your case,

695
00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:45,415
but it's definitely
not just one time.

696
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:48,001
I was here all night
going through his past cases.

697
00:25:48,052 --> 00:25:49,836
How many?

698
00:25:49,887 --> 00:25:52,723
Too many.
And I'll tell you another thing.

699
00:25:52,807 --> 00:25:55,208
I bet his first time he thought
would be his last time.

700
00:25:55,259 --> 00:25:56,426
Donna.

701
00:25:56,511 --> 00:25:57,811
If you want somebody
to just sit at her desk,

702
00:25:57,878 --> 00:25:59,212
answer your phones,
and pick up your dry cleaning,

703
00:25:59,263 --> 00:26:02,482
then put out a want ad,
because that's not me.

704
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:03,900
I'm gonna tell you
what I think.

705
00:26:03,985 --> 00:26:08,572
And what I think is,
if you do this,

706
00:26:08,656 --> 00:26:11,858
you're gonna keep doing it.

707
00:26:11,909 --> 00:26:14,945
Donna, I need you to--

708
00:26:15,029 --> 00:26:16,246
where the hell's Donna?

709
00:26:16,331 --> 00:26:18,615
I don't know.
I was waiting for her myself.

710
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:20,534
Wait somewhere else.

711
00:26:20,585 --> 00:26:22,753
- Harvey, listen--
- No, don't "Harvey" me.

712
00:26:22,837 --> 00:26:25,539
You went to my guy
about my case behind my back.

713
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:28,542
So what you need to do now
is stay out of my face.

714
00:26:41,014 --> 00:26:43,966
They told me this is
where I'd find women's softball.

715
00:26:44,051 --> 00:26:46,686
It is now.

716
00:26:48,638 --> 00:26:50,723
All right, old man,

717
00:26:50,774 --> 00:26:53,258
stand back while I knock
the cover off a few balls.

718
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:56,195
Easy, Reggie Jackson.

719
00:26:57,948 --> 00:27:00,616
I think you're maybe
forgetting I hit .385.

720
00:27:02,652 --> 00:27:05,955
Who doesn't hit
at least .350 in high school?

721
00:27:06,039 --> 00:27:08,374
Marcus didn't.

722
00:27:08,441 --> 00:27:09,875
Don't give
your brother shit.

723
00:27:09,943 --> 00:27:12,128
He's not here
to defend himself.

724
00:27:12,212 --> 00:27:14,714
Pussy.

725
00:27:14,781 --> 00:27:17,833
Hey, if he's not here
to defend himself...

726
00:27:17,918 --> 00:27:21,087
Yeah, he's not here
to hear it.

727
00:27:21,138 --> 00:27:24,590
Cheers.

728
00:27:24,641 --> 00:27:26,809
So what's going on?

729
00:27:27,928 --> 00:27:28,961
I don't know what to do.

730
00:27:29,012 --> 00:27:31,897
Well, breaking the law
isn't worth it

731
00:27:31,965 --> 00:27:33,265
no matter what the guy did.

732
00:27:33,316 --> 00:27:34,650
How'd you know?

733
00:27:34,735 --> 00:27:37,136
You're a prosecutor.
You told me you had a problem.

734
00:27:37,187 --> 00:27:38,821
Well, it's not
that simple, Dad.

735
00:27:38,905 --> 00:27:40,585
It's not just me,
and if I don't let it go,

736
00:27:40,607 --> 00:27:41,807
I'll get fired.

737
00:27:41,858 --> 00:27:43,359
If you do?

738
00:27:43,443 --> 00:27:45,161
I tell him
I'm only doing this once,

739
00:27:45,245 --> 00:27:47,312
and I'm only doing it
because it's his case,

740
00:27:47,364 --> 00:27:49,148
and I'll never do it
on one of mine.

741
00:27:49,199 --> 00:27:51,784
And then I keep knocking
the covers off the bad guys,

742
00:27:51,835 --> 00:27:52,985
which is what I do,

743
00:27:53,036 --> 00:27:56,205
and I don't bat .385,
I bat a thousand.

744
00:27:56,289 --> 00:27:58,290
All right.

745
00:28:00,961 --> 00:28:02,261
You know, I'm gonna
tell you something

746
00:28:02,328 --> 00:28:03,679
I never told you before.

747
00:28:03,764 --> 00:28:05,181
You might not wanna
hear it now,

748
00:28:05,265 --> 00:28:07,166
but you know what
your grandmother said to me

749
00:28:07,217 --> 00:28:09,218
when I told her I was gonna
ask your mother to marry me?

750
00:28:09,302 --> 00:28:10,719
What?

751
00:28:10,804 --> 00:28:13,338
Don't, because if she'll cheat
on someone else with you,

752
00:28:13,390 --> 00:28:15,340
she'll cheat on you
with someone else.

753
00:28:15,392 --> 00:28:16,675
We had a huge blowout.

754
00:28:16,726 --> 00:28:18,844
I told her
to shove it up her ass.

755
00:28:18,895 --> 00:28:20,196
Lily wouldn't do that.

756
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:22,698
She'd be different with me
because Lily loved me.

757
00:28:22,783 --> 00:28:24,200
- Dad--
- No, no, let me finish.

758
00:28:24,284 --> 00:28:25,534
Then, years later,

759
00:28:25,619 --> 00:28:29,538
I found out the other guy
thought the same thing.

760
00:28:29,623 --> 00:28:31,540
What I'm trying to say is,

761
00:28:31,625 --> 00:28:33,993
even if Cameron believes

762
00:28:34,044 --> 00:28:37,046
that he'll never
make you do it again,

763
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:39,465
he will.

764
00:28:47,808 --> 00:28:50,593
Okay, out with it.
Drop the hammer.

765
00:28:50,677 --> 00:28:53,562
They know Trevor
isn't in the class,

766
00:28:53,647 --> 00:28:55,431
so they know
he couldn't have been the one

767
00:28:55,515 --> 00:28:57,066
to steal the test.

768
00:28:57,150 --> 00:29:00,903
And they won't expel him
if he gives you up.

769
00:29:00,987 --> 00:29:02,271
How do you know that?

770
00:29:02,355 --> 00:29:05,524
I watch <i>Law & Order.</i>
I'm not an idiot.

771
00:29:08,161 --> 00:29:09,578
He'll never turn me in.

772
00:29:09,663 --> 00:29:12,615
- But you feel guilty.
- I am guilty.

773
00:29:12,699 --> 00:29:14,750
So you wanna
turn yourself in?

774
00:29:14,835 --> 00:29:17,236
They'll fail me.

775
00:29:17,287 --> 00:29:19,038
But I still have a 3.8.

776
00:29:19,089 --> 00:29:21,373
You know, there's no way Harvard
rescinds my acceptance.

777
00:29:23,093 --> 00:29:25,544
That goddamn kid.

778
00:29:25,595 --> 00:29:28,047
I guess I know
where you come down on this.

779
00:29:28,098 --> 00:29:30,099
Oh, he's an asshole
in the making,

780
00:29:30,183 --> 00:29:33,719
no question about it.

781
00:29:33,770 --> 00:29:36,272
But?

782
00:29:38,358 --> 00:29:39,975
After you lost
your mom and dad,

783
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:42,261
the Evanses offered
to take you in.

784
00:29:42,312 --> 00:29:44,897
They offered
because that little boy

785
00:29:44,948 --> 00:29:47,566
cried all night
for a month.

786
00:29:47,617 --> 00:29:48,984
He begged them.

787
00:29:49,069 --> 00:29:52,288
I'm not saying
he's the same kid anymore,

788
00:29:52,372 --> 00:29:54,957
but that kid
is in there.

789
00:30:01,798 --> 00:30:03,883
Harvey, just the man
I wanted to see.

790
00:30:03,950 --> 00:30:05,117
Why is that?

791
00:30:05,168 --> 00:30:06,785
'Cause I wanted you
to be the first to know.

792
00:30:06,836 --> 00:30:08,754
I'm looking
at my new head litigator.

793
00:30:08,805 --> 00:30:11,674
I'm afraid you're not.

794
00:30:11,758 --> 00:30:13,125
And why is that?

795
00:30:13,176 --> 00:30:16,295
Because after I show you this,
you're gonna demand this.

796
00:30:18,464 --> 00:30:20,266
You disclosed that report.

797
00:30:20,317 --> 00:30:23,135
That affidavit
says I made a mistake,

798
00:30:23,186 --> 00:30:24,687
an honest mistake.

799
00:30:24,771 --> 00:30:27,472
And this one says,
as my penance,

800
00:30:27,524 --> 00:30:29,692
I'm resigning.

801
00:30:29,776 --> 00:30:32,144
So you're just gonna put
two killers back on the street.

802
00:30:32,195 --> 00:30:34,196
If you're half the prosecutor
you say you are,

803
00:30:34,281 --> 00:30:35,864
you can still
put 'em away.

804
00:30:35,949 --> 00:30:37,166
And I don't give a shit

805
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:38,667
whether you feel comfortable
with that or not,

806
00:30:38,752 --> 00:30:40,252
because you said
it was your case,

807
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,987
but you made it my case.

808
00:30:42,038 --> 00:30:43,822
I made it our case,
because I thought

809
00:30:43,873 --> 00:30:45,657
you were about putting
bad guys behind bars.

810
00:30:45,709 --> 00:30:47,876
Cameron, you asked
what if they got out

811
00:30:47,961 --> 00:30:49,044
and killed my father?

812
00:30:49,129 --> 00:30:50,846
Well, I think
the question is:

813
00:30:50,931 --> 00:30:53,382
What if my father found out
what I did to put them in?

814
00:30:54,884 --> 00:30:57,502
You goddamn pussy.

815
00:30:57,554 --> 00:31:00,055
The only thing
that makes me a pussy

816
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:02,358
is that I didn't send
that affidavit in

817
00:31:02,442 --> 00:31:05,277
the second I found out.

818
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:16,572
Sir, I know you
offered Trevor Evans

819
00:31:16,656 --> 00:31:20,459
a way to avoid expulsion.

820
00:31:20,526 --> 00:31:22,194
Well, the reason
he didn't take it

821
00:31:22,245 --> 00:31:24,663
is he was trying--

822
00:31:24,714 --> 00:31:26,415
he was trying
to protect me.

823
00:31:26,499 --> 00:31:29,385
He's the one
who sold the test,

824
00:31:29,469 --> 00:31:32,805
but I'm the one
who took it.

825
00:31:32,872 --> 00:31:34,039
So please,

826
00:31:34,090 --> 00:31:36,375
do not punish him
for his loyalty to me.

827
00:31:36,426 --> 00:31:39,711
Truth is,
with the way his grades are,

828
00:31:39,763 --> 00:31:41,897
I don't think
it'll matter anyway.

829
00:31:41,982 --> 00:31:44,483
So I'll tell you what,

830
00:31:44,550 --> 00:31:46,051
I'm not going to expel
your friend.

831
00:31:48,021 --> 00:31:49,488
Oh, thank you, sir.

832
00:31:49,555 --> 00:31:51,740
There's just one thing.

833
00:31:51,825 --> 00:31:53,609
You're his roommate.

834
00:31:53,693 --> 00:31:56,412
And you scored perfectly
on that test.

835
00:31:56,496 --> 00:31:58,664
I knew it was you.

836
00:31:58,731 --> 00:32:00,616
I also know you're only
sitting here in front of my face

837
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:02,901
because you think whatever
I do to you won't matter.

838
00:32:02,952 --> 00:32:04,253
No, sir,
that's not true.

839
00:32:04,337 --> 00:32:06,872
Well, let me tell you
what is true,

840
00:32:06,923 --> 00:32:09,124
you little piece of shit.

841
00:32:09,209 --> 00:32:11,877
The young woman you sold
the test to was my daughter.

842
00:32:11,928 --> 00:32:14,013
They're demanding
my resignation.

843
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,048
And as my last official act,

844
00:32:16,099 --> 00:32:18,267
I'm expelling you
from this school,

845
00:32:18,351 --> 00:32:22,471
and then
I'm gonna call Harvard.

846
00:32:22,555 --> 00:32:23,922
Believe me when I tell you,

847
00:32:23,973 --> 00:32:26,108
you're never going there.

848
00:32:37,287 --> 00:32:39,738
I decided what kind
of attorney I want to be.

849
00:32:39,789 --> 00:32:41,606
I heard.
You quit.

850
00:32:41,658 --> 00:32:44,626
Did you hear I also turned
over the toxicology report?

851
00:32:44,711 --> 00:32:47,079
You didn't.

852
00:32:47,130 --> 00:32:49,298
Thought you were
supposed to know everything.

853
00:32:49,382 --> 00:32:51,583
How'd you not know this?

854
00:32:51,634 --> 00:32:53,252
Well, I knew that you were
either gonna take that promotion

855
00:32:53,303 --> 00:32:54,619
or you were gonna quit.

856
00:32:54,671 --> 00:32:56,839
And either way, I wasn't
sticking around to find out.

857
00:32:56,923 --> 00:32:59,124
- You quit?
- Damn straight.

858
00:32:59,175 --> 00:33:01,343
I'm not working at a place
headed by a viper.

859
00:33:01,428 --> 00:33:03,512
Donna, I can't get you
another job.

860
00:33:03,596 --> 00:33:06,432
Oh, well, that's gonna make
my decision easier.

861
00:33:06,483 --> 00:33:07,983
What does that mean?

862
00:33:08,068 --> 00:33:09,968
I'm choosing
between Bratton Gould,

863
00:33:10,019 --> 00:33:11,854
Skadden Arps,
and O'Melveny & Myers.

864
00:33:11,938 --> 00:33:13,638
If I had another one,
I don't know what I'd do.

865
00:33:13,690 --> 00:33:16,492
You know,
it just occurred to me

866
00:33:16,576 --> 00:33:18,944
that you and I
don't work together anymore.

867
00:33:18,995 --> 00:33:21,113
Yeah, that didn't
just occur to you.

868
00:33:21,164 --> 00:33:23,648
No, it didn't.

869
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:25,951
Do you know
how I know that?

870
00:33:26,002 --> 00:33:27,336
'Cause you knew
I'd show up here

871
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:28,871
the second
you heard I quit?

872
00:33:28,955 --> 00:33:30,672
Why do you think
I have this in my hand?

873
00:33:30,757 --> 00:33:33,041
What are we waiting for?

874
00:33:33,126 --> 00:33:35,166
For you to figure out
that it's time to come inside.

875
00:33:48,888 --> 00:33:50,173
So let me get this straight.

876
00:33:50,243 --> 00:33:51,577
You turned me down before,

877
00:33:51,661 --> 00:33:53,462
and now you're saying
you want to come back?

878
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:54,780
Yes.

879
00:33:54,864 --> 00:33:56,398
And it has nothing
to do with our coup?

880
00:33:56,449 --> 00:33:57,833
I didn't even know
you did it

881
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:59,284
until I saw your name
on the wall.

882
00:33:59,369 --> 00:34:00,419
You got it up there fast.

883
00:34:00,503 --> 00:34:01,503
Don't tell 'em
you're coming,

884
00:34:01,571 --> 00:34:03,455
and slam the door
behind them.

885
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:06,375
Now why should I take someone
who waited for me to win?

886
00:34:06,426 --> 00:34:07,376
Because I'm someone
you trusted with the news

887
00:34:07,427 --> 00:34:08,877
in the first place.

888
00:34:08,928 --> 00:34:11,847
I also trusted
all the people who voted for me.

889
00:34:11,914 --> 00:34:15,100
Come clean, Harvey.
What changed your mind?

890
00:34:15,185 --> 00:34:16,385
Instead of thinking

891
00:34:16,436 --> 00:34:18,554
about what I wanna be doing
in ten years,

892
00:34:18,605 --> 00:34:22,474
I started thinking about
who I want to be doing it with.

893
00:34:22,559 --> 00:34:24,810
Me over him.

894
00:34:27,763 --> 00:34:29,531
Terms are nonnegotiable.

895
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:31,233
You get what I give you.

896
00:34:31,284 --> 00:34:34,269
Fine by me, but I'm getting
my own secretary.

897
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,937
Associates don't get
their own secretaries.

898
00:34:35,989 --> 00:34:37,606
This isn't
about the associate.

899
00:34:37,657 --> 00:34:39,274
It's about the secretary,

900
00:34:39,325 --> 00:34:40,826
and I'm not coming here
without her.

901
00:34:40,910 --> 00:34:43,462
She must be very special.

902
00:34:43,546 --> 00:34:45,964
She is.

903
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:49,168
Difference comes out
of your pocket.

904
00:34:49,252 --> 00:34:50,836
As long
as she never knows.

905
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,754
Welcome back, Harvey.

906
00:34:52,806 --> 00:34:55,174
You start Monday.

907
00:34:55,258 --> 00:34:56,175
Give it up.

908
00:34:56,259 --> 00:34:58,343
Oh, no.

909
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:06,485
So what was so important

910
00:35:06,569 --> 00:35:09,304
that you just had to see me?

911
00:35:09,355 --> 00:35:10,489
I don't know how to say it,

912
00:35:10,573 --> 00:35:11,607
so I'm just gonna come out
and say it.

913
00:35:11,658 --> 00:35:14,142
But I don't want
to lose you.

914
00:35:16,613 --> 00:35:18,614
Come work for me.

915
00:35:18,665 --> 00:35:19,615
What?

916
00:35:19,666 --> 00:35:20,916
Don't go to Skadden.

917
00:35:20,983 --> 00:35:23,585
I took a job
at my old firm.

918
00:35:24,871 --> 00:35:27,089
I was hoping
you'd be happy.

919
00:35:27,156 --> 00:35:28,323
What? I am.

920
00:35:28,374 --> 00:35:29,324
If this is
about your rule--

921
00:35:29,375 --> 00:35:30,659
No, it's not about that.

922
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:32,427
Because if I had known
that this was gonna happen,

923
00:35:32,495 --> 00:35:35,264
I never would
have come over.

924
00:35:35,331 --> 00:35:37,332
Why didn't you know
that it was gonna happen?

925
00:35:37,383 --> 00:35:40,469
Because I hadn't thought
about taking another job before.

926
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:43,055
And when I did...

927
00:35:45,725 --> 00:35:47,693
I thought about who I wanted
to take it with.

928
00:35:47,777 --> 00:35:50,011
Look, I don't wanna find out
what kind of lawyer

929
00:35:50,063 --> 00:35:52,180
I'd be without you.

930
00:36:01,023 --> 00:36:03,659
Okay, I will come work with you
on two conditions.

931
00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:06,078
First, we put it
out of our minds,

932
00:36:06,162 --> 00:36:08,714
and we never
mention it again.

933
00:36:10,717 --> 00:36:13,335
Second?

934
00:36:13,386 --> 00:36:16,471
You're giving me
a huge goddamn signing bonus.

935
00:36:18,841 --> 00:36:20,726
How do you know
that's enough?

936
00:36:20,810 --> 00:36:22,930
Because you're the one
who's gonna fill in the amount.

937
00:36:23,012 --> 00:36:25,898
Oh, my God,
you really do need me...

938
00:36:25,982 --> 00:36:27,849
To stop you
from doing shit like this.

939
00:36:27,901 --> 00:36:28,850
Oh, well...

940
00:36:28,902 --> 00:36:30,885
In the future.

941
00:36:34,107 --> 00:36:35,056
Hmm.

942
00:36:35,108 --> 00:36:36,725
What?

943
00:36:36,776 --> 00:36:37,993
We're gonna need
a new ritual.

944
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:40,562
Well, maybe we can think
of something to do

945
00:36:40,613 --> 00:36:43,031
with a can opener.

946
00:36:43,082 --> 00:36:46,001
Harvey, that's the dumbest
thing I've ever heard.

947
00:36:46,068 --> 00:36:48,203
Jeez.

948
00:36:50,072 --> 00:36:52,341
Actually...

949
00:36:57,847 --> 00:36:59,214
What are you doing here,
Harvey?

950
00:36:59,265 --> 00:37:00,749
It's 7:00 a.m.

951
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,134
I didn't know
you were gonna be here.

952
00:37:02,218 --> 00:37:03,685
I love this place.

953
00:37:03,753 --> 00:37:04,886
Really?

954
00:37:04,938 --> 00:37:06,939
You've only ever been here
once before.

955
00:37:07,023 --> 00:37:07,973
How'd you know that?

956
00:37:08,057 --> 00:37:10,359
I know.

957
00:37:11,694 --> 00:37:14,479
You and Stephen,
it bothers me.

958
00:37:14,564 --> 00:37:16,865
I know it's not fair,
but it does.

959
00:37:16,932 --> 00:37:18,150
Good.

960
00:37:18,234 --> 00:37:19,155
What do you mean, good?

961
00:37:19,235 --> 00:37:20,935
I mean,
we both knew it.

962
00:37:20,987 --> 00:37:23,271
It's good that you finally
were able to say it.

963
00:37:23,323 --> 00:37:25,240
You realize just
because it bothers me,

964
00:37:25,291 --> 00:37:26,625
it doesn't mean
that I want us to be--

965
00:37:26,709 --> 00:37:28,627
I know.

966
00:37:28,711 --> 00:37:30,629
Jeez.

967
00:37:32,498 --> 00:37:35,116
You know this is exactly
why I had that policy.

968
00:37:35,168 --> 00:37:37,952
Well, then why did
you change it?

969
00:37:39,639 --> 00:37:43,175
Because I have to live
my life, Harvey.

970
00:37:43,259 --> 00:37:45,293
I've never apologized
for who I am,

971
00:37:45,345 --> 00:37:46,795
and I'm not gonna
start now.

972
00:37:46,846 --> 00:37:48,597
You don't need
to apologize for anything.

973
00:37:48,648 --> 00:37:51,683
I know.

974
00:37:51,768 --> 00:37:53,652
But you do.

975
00:37:55,738 --> 00:37:58,407
For taking so long
to say that it bothered you.

976
00:37:58,474 --> 00:37:59,691
Jesus.

977
00:37:59,776 --> 00:38:02,911
And let's just
put an order in

978
00:38:02,978 --> 00:38:04,997
for the valet
to hold my suit jackets,

979
00:38:05,081 --> 00:38:06,782
and then we c--
Harvey.

980
00:38:06,833 --> 00:38:08,083
Louis.

981
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:09,317
What are you doing here?

982
00:38:09,369 --> 00:38:10,669
You're not due back

983
00:38:10,753 --> 00:38:11,837
for another two years,
three months, and five days,

984
00:38:11,921 --> 00:38:13,038
not that I'm keeping track.

985
00:38:13,122 --> 00:38:15,040
Change of plans.
I'm back today.

986
00:38:15,124 --> 00:38:18,627
Who's your girlfriend?

987
00:38:18,678 --> 00:38:20,512
Oh, I'm not his girlfriend.

988
00:38:20,596 --> 00:38:22,381
I'm his girl Friday.

989
00:38:22,465 --> 00:38:24,132
Associates
don't get secretaries.

990
00:38:24,183 --> 00:38:25,834
I'm not like
other associates,

991
00:38:25,885 --> 00:38:27,219
and she's not like
other secretaries.

992
00:38:27,303 --> 00:38:29,971
- Bullshit.
- Donna?

993
00:38:30,023 --> 00:38:31,690
Okay, listen, <i>Rain Man,</i>
you wear lifts in your shoes,

994
00:38:31,774 --> 00:38:33,358
you want braces,
but you don't have the balls,

995
00:38:33,443 --> 00:38:34,860
and you have a cat

996
00:38:34,944 --> 00:38:38,513
that you love
more than it loves you.

997
00:38:38,564 --> 00:38:40,482
- Good to see you, Louis.
- Mm.

998
00:38:40,533 --> 00:38:43,702
I need a day.

999
00:38:45,955 --> 00:38:46,872
You going down?

1000
00:38:46,956 --> 00:38:49,207
All the way up, asshole.

1001
00:38:49,292 --> 00:38:51,025
I'll take the ride.

1002
00:38:55,882 --> 00:38:58,050
Hey.
Hey.

1003
00:39:01,838 --> 00:39:03,588
What's that?

1004
00:39:03,673 --> 00:39:05,206
This is my way
of showing you

1005
00:39:05,258 --> 00:39:07,676
that no matter
what you choose,

1006
00:39:07,727 --> 00:39:09,895
I support you.

1007
00:39:09,979 --> 00:39:11,847
And if your dream
is to go to Stanford,

1008
00:39:11,898 --> 00:39:14,900
then that's my dream
for you too.

1009
00:39:21,891 --> 00:39:23,692
How does it look?

1010
00:39:23,743 --> 00:39:26,695
I have to admit,
it looks pretty good.

1011
00:39:28,531 --> 00:39:30,866
So what changed
your mind?

1012
00:39:45,098 --> 00:39:46,381
You got into Harvard?

1013
00:39:46,432 --> 00:39:48,850
It's a--
it's a long story,

1014
00:39:48,918 --> 00:39:50,418
but I have to go
right now.

1015
00:39:50,470 --> 00:39:53,638
I wanted to be here
when you got home.

1016
00:39:53,723 --> 00:39:54,856
But if you let me,

1017
00:39:54,924 --> 00:39:56,424
I'd like to come
straight back here

1018
00:39:56,476 --> 00:39:57,726
and tell you
the whole thing.

1019
00:39:57,777 --> 00:39:59,444
Okay.

1020
00:39:59,529 --> 00:40:01,696
Okay.

1021
00:40:10,864 --> 00:40:13,983
Any progress
getting to Mariga?

1022
00:40:14,034 --> 00:40:15,297
Cameron's not just bluffing

1023
00:40:15,298 --> 00:40:17,049
about what Mariga's
gonna say.

1024
00:40:17,134 --> 00:40:18,134
He doesn't even have him.

1025
00:40:18,135 --> 00:40:19,135
That means we--

1026
00:40:19,186 --> 00:40:21,503
We win.
It's over.

1027
00:40:23,473 --> 00:40:26,559
Ah, it's gonna be fun
telling Cameron that.

1028
00:40:26,643 --> 00:40:28,027
It's gonna be fun for Mike.

1029
00:40:28,111 --> 00:40:30,479
I've got
something else to do,

1030
00:40:30,530 --> 00:40:32,815
and it's not
gonna be fun.

1031
00:40:32,866 --> 00:40:34,734
Is that
why we're up here?

1032
00:40:34,818 --> 00:40:36,685
You remember
when you told me you decided

1033
00:40:36,737 --> 00:40:39,855
to take Gordon, Schmidt,
and Van Dyke down?

1034
00:40:39,906 --> 00:40:42,124
I guess that is
why we're up here.

1035
00:40:42,192 --> 00:40:43,576
You said,
take them in the night

1036
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:45,360
because nighttime's
when they're sleeping.

1037
00:40:45,412 --> 00:40:46,712
And you thought
I was wrong.

1038
00:40:46,797 --> 00:40:49,248
And then you said
if I were ever in your shoes,

1039
00:40:49,332 --> 00:40:53,052
I might think differently.

1040
00:40:53,136 --> 00:40:54,837
What'd you do, Harvey?

1041
00:40:54,888 --> 00:40:57,206
I made a move
in the night.

1042
00:40:59,059 --> 00:41:01,477
I get Ava Hessington
acquitted...

1043
00:41:03,764 --> 00:41:05,547
Darby backs me
for managing partner.

1044
00:41:15,742 --> 00:41:17,726
I guess congratulations
are in order.

1045
00:41:17,778 --> 00:41:19,538
I'm here to tell you
I don't want it anymore.

1046
00:41:19,579 --> 00:41:21,414
Get out of my sight.

1047
00:41:44,054 --> 00:41:45,888
You look ready
to attack.

1048
00:41:45,939 --> 00:41:48,057
Does Harvey know his puppy's
off his leash?

1049
00:41:48,108 --> 00:41:49,925
Harvey said he didn't need
to waste a trip down here

1050
00:41:49,976 --> 00:41:52,594
just for me to tell you
I have my eye on the ball.

1051
00:41:52,646 --> 00:41:54,864
I'm afraid
I don't follow you.

1052
00:41:54,931 --> 00:41:56,265
Mariga.

1053
00:41:56,316 --> 00:41:58,200
You weren't lying
about what he would say.

1054
00:41:58,268 --> 00:42:00,269
You were lying about having him
in the first place.

1055
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:02,040
This whole thing
was designed just to get us

1056
00:42:02,105 --> 00:42:04,573
to sign your bullshit deal.

1057
00:42:04,624 --> 00:42:05,708
You're right.

1058
00:42:05,775 --> 00:42:07,376
We didn't have him,
but we do now,

1059
00:42:07,443 --> 00:42:09,328
and he's on a flight
as we speak.

1060
00:42:09,412 --> 00:42:11,580
So you do me a favor,
and you tell Harvey

1061
00:42:11,631 --> 00:42:13,792
he can take that bullshit deal
and shove it up his ass,

1062
00:42:13,834 --> 00:42:14,967
'cause we're going
to trial.

1063
00:42:15,051 --> 00:42:16,135
No way.

1064
00:42:16,219 --> 00:42:17,286
If you didn't have
Mariga yesterday,

1065
00:42:17,337 --> 00:42:18,620
you don't have him today.

1066
00:42:18,672 --> 00:42:21,140
Why don't you ask
your friend Stephen Huntley?

1067
00:42:21,224 --> 00:42:24,260
He's the one who led me
right to him.
