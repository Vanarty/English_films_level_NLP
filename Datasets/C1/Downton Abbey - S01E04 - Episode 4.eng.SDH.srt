Has she recovered from...

She won't do that, either.

-Oh, I am sorry.

Mrs. Crawley tells me she's recommended
nitrate of silver and tincture of steel.

Is she making a suit of armor?

471

-But I take it there's been no improvement?
-Not really.

472
00:33:42,668 --> 00:33:48,414
-And you're sure it's Erysipelas?
-That is Mrs. Crawley's diagnosis.

-It has its uses.

I see your father
has been making changes at home.

00:33:58,642 --> 00:34:01,769
He has, my lady. He's got no use
for the herb garden now me mother's gone,

477
00:34:01,853 --> 00:34:02,895
so he's turned it to grass.

478
00:34:02,979 --> 00:34:05,892
-And you've been helping him?
-I have.

-Grubbing out the old rue hedge?
-How did you know that?

480
00:34:11,279 --> 00:34:15,694
Because this is not Erysipelas,
this is a rue allergy.

481
00:34:17,118 --> 00:34:20,200
If Molesley wears gardening gloves,
it'll be gone in a week.

491
00:35:00,076 --> 00:35:01,911
Are you beginning to
see a future here, then?

492
00:35:01,995 --> 00:35:04,163
In a way, this latest business
has forced me to recognize

493
00:35:04,247 --> 00:35:07,035
that I do want Downton to be my future.

494
00:35:08,251 --> 00:35:09,787
I'm glad.

495
00:35:09,877 --> 00:35:12,588
You must have thought me
an awful prig when I first arrived.

496
00:35:12,672 --> 00:35:13,878
Not a prig.

497
00:35:14,007 --> 00:35:17,419
Just a man thrust into something
he never wanted or envisaged.

498
00:35:17,509 --> 00:35:19,928
I could only see the absurdity
of the whole thing.

499
00:35:20,012 --> 00:35:22,222
-I'm sorry.
-Well, there are absurdities involved,

500
00:35:22,306 --> 00:35:23,888
as I know well enough.

501
00:35:23,974 --> 00:35:30,141
Possibilities, too, and I was blind to them.
I was determined not to let it change me.

502
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:33,393
-It was absurd. If you don't change, you die.
-Do you think so?

503
00:35:33,483 --> 00:35:36,601
I'm not sure. Sometimes
I think I hate change.

504
00:35:36,695 --> 00:35:40,689
Well, at least we can comfort ourselves
that this will still be here.

505
00:35:40,782 --> 00:35:42,614
Because we saved it.

506
00:35:46,787 --> 00:35:48,487
DAISY: Thomas is lovely, isn't he?

507
00:35:49,415 --> 00:35:52,077
He's funny and handsome,

508
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:56,078
-and he's got such lovely teeth.
-He's not for you, Daisy.

509
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:59,007
Of course not.
He's too good for me, I know that.

510
00:35:59,091 --> 00:36:03,176
-No. He's not too good.
-What, then?

511
00:36:03,262 --> 00:36:07,426
He's not the boy for you,
and you're not the girl for him.

512
00:36:08,225 --> 00:36:10,466
Isn't that what I just said?

513
00:36:11,936 --> 00:36:13,768
And why would he be?

514
00:36:13,855 --> 00:36:19,100
When he's seen and done so much,
and I've been nowhere and done nothing.

515
00:36:19,944 --> 00:36:23,187
Perhaps Thomas has seen and done
more than is good for him.

516
00:36:25,575 --> 00:36:27,532
He's not a ladies' man.

517
00:36:28,787 --> 00:36:34,328
-Well, isn't it a blessed relief?
-Daisy, Thomas is a troubled soul.

518
00:36:36,086 --> 00:36:38,086
I don't know what you mean, Mrs. Patmore.

519
00:36:39,339 --> 00:36:43,673
Oh, nothing. I don't mean anything.

520
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:49,300
Except, if I don't get the ice cream
started, they'll be dining at midnight.

521
00:36:55,104 --> 00:36:57,311
Golly, my corset's tight.

522

Anna, when you've done that,
would you be an angel and loosen it a bit?

523
00:37:00,818 --> 00:37:04,777
-The start of the slippery slope.
-I'm not putting on weight.

524
00:37:05,239 --> 00:37:06,789
It didn't shrink in the drawer.

525
00:37:08,325 --> 00:37:09,564
Are you coming down?

526
00:37:09,659 --> 00:37:11,946
I don't know why we bother with corsets.

527
00:37:12,036 --> 00:37:14,955
Men don't wear them, and they look
perfectly normal in their clothes.

528

-Not all of them.
-She's just showing off.

529

She'll be on about the vote in a minute.

530
00:37:19,544 --> 00:37:22,794
If you mean do I think women
should have the vote, of course I do.

531
00:37:23,047 --> 00:37:25,174
I hope you won't chain yourself
to the railings

532
00:37:25,258 --> 00:37:27,215
and end up being force-fed semolina.

533
00:37:28,261 --> 00:37:30,172
What do you think, Anna?

534
00:37:30,263 --> 00:37:33,506
-I think those women are very brave.
-Hear, hear.

with your dressmaker?

536

-I did.

have it done by Friday.

with the work on the cottages?

540

a very good job of them.

541

You must all go and see.

543
00:37:55,704 --> 00:37:58,196
It was Matthew's idea.

544
00:37:58,290 --> 00:38:01,533
Old Cripps was rather reluctant,
but I'm pleased we went forward.

545
00:38:01,626 --> 00:38:04,618
EDITH: I suppose it's worth it?
SYBIL: Of course it is.

546
00:38:04,713 --> 00:38:06,713
Because of the people who'll live in them.

547
00:38:06,797 --> 00:38:08,548
You'll be glad to hear
that Matthew's conscience

548
00:38:08,632 --> 00:38:10,418
is much more energetic than mine.

549
00:38:10,509 --> 00:38:13,387
If you'll excuse me, I'm going to bed.
I've rather a headache.

550

Of course. Shall I bring you
something for it?

00:38:16,432 --> 00:38:18,982
No. I'll be perfectly
fine, if I can just lie down.

Oh, Mother, don't you see?
He has a son now.

558
00:38:47,504 --> 00:38:50,462
Of course he didn't argue with the entail.
Why would he?

-Your father loves you very much.
-He wouldn't fight for me, though.

561
00:38:57,388 --> 00:39:01,177
He wouldn't fight for you
because he knew he couldn't win.

-You're no better.
-What?

You don't care about
Matthew getting everything,

564

-Mary!
-I wish you'd just admit it.

I'm a lost soul to you.

thought of marriage, a Turk!

Don't worry, Mama. You can go down now.

Everything will look better in the
morning. Isn't that what you usually say?

571
00:39:37,969 --> 00:39:40,336
I say it because it's usually true.

00:39:41,430 --> 00:39:43,216
Papa will wonder where you are.

00:39:53,109 --> 00:39:56,227
-Don't quarrel with Matthew.
-Why shouldn't I?

574

Because one day you may need him.

Oh, I see.

576

When I've ruined myself, I must have
a powerful protector to hide behind.

-Busy, I suppose.

more thrilling than a new frock?

suited for the post and better qualified.

-Let's face it.

for the post or worse qualified than I am.

to you about, if you've a minute.

608
00:43:36,491 --> 00:43:41,327
Before I first came here as head
housemaid, I was walking out with a farmer.

609
00:43:44,165 --> 00:43:48,374
<i>When I told him I'd taken a job at
Downton, he asked ME to Marry him.</i>

so I knew the life.</i>

611

He was very nice,
but then I came here and I did well and...

612
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:04,511
I didn't want to give it up. So I told
him no, and he married someone else.

<i>She died three years ago.</i>

614
00:44:08,730 --> 00:44:12,394
<i>And last month he wrote,
asking to see Me again.</i>

We had dinner at the Grantham Arms
and after, he took me to the fair.

619
00:44:27,873 --> 00:44:31,616
And he was horrible and fat and red-faced,

620
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:34,577

what you ever saw in him.
