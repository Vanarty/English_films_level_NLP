1
00:00:01,535 --> 00:00:02,998
Ava Hessington,
you're under arrest.

2
00:00:03,023 --> 00:00:04,134
Conspiracy
to commit murder.

3
00:00:04,135 --> 00:00:05,335
If you're looking
to ride

4
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:06,286
some partner's coattails,
you're gonna have

5
00:00:06,337 --> 00:00:08,221
to look somewhere else.

6
00:00:08,289 --> 00:00:09,756
Stephen Huntley,
senior partner, London office.

7
00:00:09,807 --> 00:00:13,093
I want you to find out
what the hell that guy's up to.

8
00:00:13,144 --> 00:00:14,428
I know about your deal
with Edward.

9
00:00:14,479 --> 00:00:16,346
I don't need you
baby-sitting me on this case.

10
00:00:16,431 --> 00:00:18,482
Tony Gianopolous got a hold
of that video.

11
00:00:18,566 --> 00:00:19,833
I think he's trying
to take over the company.

12
00:00:19,901 --> 00:00:22,369
You told me
to take this deal.

13
00:00:22,437 --> 00:00:24,187
I did,
and now here I am.

14
00:00:24,272 --> 00:00:25,822
I didn't know
about these murders.

15
00:00:25,907 --> 00:00:28,158
What you don't seem to believe
is neither did I.

16
00:00:28,701 --> 00:00:30,119
You're not the fool anymore,
Louis.

17
00:00:30,203 --> 00:00:31,737
Mike Ross is.

18
00:00:31,788 --> 00:00:33,104
And I can't take it back.

19
00:00:33,156 --> 00:00:34,907
Your future at this firm
is over.

20
00:00:34,958 --> 00:00:36,759
This is everything I have
on Tony Gianopolous.

21
00:00:36,793 --> 00:00:38,494
Welcome to team Litt.

22
00:00:38,578 --> 00:00:41,997
We just admitted to each other
that we're defending a murderer.

23
00:00:42,081 --> 00:00:44,166
It doesn't really seem
like cause for celebration.

24
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:45,317
It's not a celebration.

25
00:00:45,385 --> 00:00:46,452
I made a deal with Darby

26
00:00:46,519 --> 00:00:48,220
to take over the firm
from Jessica.

27
00:01:29,562 --> 00:01:30,996
- You heard?
- I heard.

28
00:01:31,047 --> 00:01:33,215
- Vote's in 48 hours.
- She's not losing that vote.

29
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:36,018
- I'm getting my shit.
- I got my shit.

30
00:01:36,102 --> 00:01:37,719
- Conference room.
- Five minutes.

31
00:01:42,859 --> 00:01:43,809
What is she doing here?

32
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:45,310
She's my new associate.

33
00:01:45,361 --> 00:01:46,845
So that's why you made
the video.

34
00:01:46,896 --> 00:01:48,536
You seem upset
that she led you to believe

35
00:01:48,615 --> 00:01:49,815
that she was trying
to befriend you

36
00:01:49,866 --> 00:01:51,366
when it turned out
she was gonna betray you.

37
00:01:51,451 --> 00:01:53,285
- Louis.
- You got a problem with that?

38
00:01:53,352 --> 00:01:54,686
No.
No problem.

39
00:01:54,737 --> 00:01:56,121
Not as long
as your daddy's here.

40
00:01:56,188 --> 00:01:57,656
Do I have to have
another talk with you?

41
00:01:57,707 --> 00:01:59,558
- He had a talk with you?
- Yes.

42
00:01:59,626 --> 00:02:01,627
But I didn't feel the need
to run to you to protect me.

43
00:02:01,694 --> 00:02:02,911
Second choice never does.

44
00:02:02,996 --> 00:02:04,046
I can't believe it's up to me

45
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:05,130
to be the adult in the room.

46
00:02:05,197 --> 00:02:07,382
Maybe it's time
we get down to business.

47
00:02:07,467 --> 00:02:09,167
Good, because the first order
of business

48
00:02:09,219 --> 00:02:11,670
is discussing what to do
following Ava's statement.

49
00:02:11,721 --> 00:02:12,881
She's not making a statement.

50
00:02:12,889 --> 00:02:14,506
- Yes, she is.
- Ava makes a statement,

51
00:02:14,557 --> 00:02:15,707
Cameron's gonna be all over it.

52
00:02:15,758 --> 00:02:17,375
Cameron Dennis
isn't the problem right now.

53
00:02:17,427 --> 00:02:19,895
The problem is Ava Hessington
isn't a credible CEO.

54
00:02:19,979 --> 00:02:22,648
The problem is she's on trial
for murder.

55
00:02:22,715 --> 00:02:24,433
And public perception
says that she's as guilty

56
00:02:24,517 --> 00:02:26,477
as Jean Valjean with a loaf
of bread in his pants.

57
00:02:28,104 --> 00:02:30,606
We're facing a vote for control
of her company in two days.

58
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:32,774
Talking under threat
makes her look desperate.

59
00:02:32,859 --> 00:02:35,327
And not talking makes her look
either guilty or incompetent.

60
00:02:35,394 --> 00:02:37,062
We need to send the message
to Wall Street

61
00:02:37,113 --> 00:02:39,197
that she's in control
and she's got nothing to hide.

62
00:02:39,249 --> 00:02:41,366
This is a meeting
about how to keep Ava's company

63
00:02:41,417 --> 00:02:43,619
without endangering
her murder defense.

64
00:02:43,703 --> 00:02:45,087
Did it ever occur to you that,
if she's cold enough

65
00:02:45,171 --> 00:02:46,738
to kill off opposition
to her pipeline,

66
00:02:46,789 --> 00:02:49,207
she's cold enough to pull off
lying to the press?

67
00:02:49,259 --> 00:02:52,577
I mean, we all know
she did this, right?

68
00:02:56,716 --> 00:02:58,517
This isn't open
for discussion.

69
00:02:58,584 --> 00:02:59,952
She's not saying a word.

70
00:03:00,019 --> 00:03:01,436
I'm afraid it's too late.

71
00:03:01,521 --> 00:03:03,272
What did you do?

72
00:03:03,356 --> 00:03:04,606
She's on her way
to an interview right now.

73
00:03:04,691 --> 00:03:05,724
It'll run in the <i>Journal,</i>

74
00:03:05,775 --> 00:03:07,109
and then it will blow
Gianopolous

75
00:03:07,193 --> 00:03:09,861
and his bullshit takeover
attempt out of the water.

76
00:03:14,901 --> 00:03:17,069
- Connelly.
- Mr. Connelly, I do apologize,

77
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,321
but I'm afraid we have to change
the location of our interview.

78
00:03:19,405 --> 00:03:21,673
- Who is this?
- Miss Hessington's assistant.

79
00:03:21,741 --> 00:03:23,875
Well, I spoke to her assistant
this morning--

80
00:03:23,943 --> 00:03:26,461
Yes, Rebecca handles
Miss Hessington's schedule.

81
00:03:26,546 --> 00:03:28,213
I handle her life.

82
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,165
What, so I'm supposed
to traipse all over town

83
00:03:30,249 --> 00:03:31,249
because of what she'd prefer?

84
00:03:31,301 --> 00:03:33,719
- Not prefer. Insist.
- Insist?

85
00:03:33,786 --> 00:03:35,887
I'm giving her a forum
to tell her side of the story.

86
00:03:35,955 --> 00:03:38,557
An exclusive forum
which needn't be the case.

87
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:40,142
Now make no mistake,
Mr. Connelly,

88
00:03:40,226 --> 00:03:42,177
Miss Hessington is the one
doing the favor here.

89
00:03:42,261 --> 00:03:43,795
So, if you'd like
to speak with her,

90
00:03:43,846 --> 00:03:46,515
my driver will be more
than happy to take you to her.

91
00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:49,935
Or if you would prefer
to call Rebecca,

92
00:03:49,986 --> 00:03:51,603
I'm sure she'll be able
to set something up for you

93
00:03:51,654 --> 00:03:55,140
sometime say next December.

94
00:04:09,339 --> 00:04:10,672
Go ahead and order.

95
00:04:10,757 --> 00:04:12,490
Connelly's
running a little late.

96
00:04:12,542 --> 00:04:13,792
He should get here

97
00:04:13,843 --> 00:04:15,827
at ten past "you're not giving
an interview."

98
00:04:15,878 --> 00:04:17,512
I wasn't trying
to keep this from you.

99
00:04:17,597 --> 00:04:19,848
You didn't exactly cc me
on the memo.

100
00:04:19,932 --> 00:04:22,684
Very well.
You want the truth?

101
00:04:22,769 --> 00:04:26,104
I don't particularly appreciate
being muzzled.

102
00:04:26,172 --> 00:04:27,973
I suggest you don't think
of it as muzzled so much

103
00:04:28,024 --> 00:04:30,225
as keeping you out of jail
for the rest of your life.

104
00:04:30,309 --> 00:04:32,227
And what'll you have me do,
Harvey, hmm?

105
00:04:32,311 --> 00:04:34,529
Take a week in St. Barts?

106
00:04:34,614 --> 00:04:35,847
Because that is not going
to happen.

107
00:04:35,898 --> 00:04:37,282
I know that's not going
to happen.

108
00:04:37,349 --> 00:04:38,700
You're on trial for murder.

109
00:04:38,785 --> 00:04:40,869
And because of that
a tender offer's being made

110
00:04:40,953 --> 00:04:43,572
on a company
with my family name.

111
00:04:43,656 --> 00:04:46,124
And with all that going on,
the fact that I haven't made

112
00:04:46,192 --> 00:04:48,326
a statement defending myself
is bullshit.

113
00:04:48,378 --> 00:04:49,911
It's not bullshit.
It's smart.

114
00:04:49,996 --> 00:04:51,713
Of course you see it that way.

115
00:04:51,798 --> 00:04:53,632
You think I'm guilty.

116
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:55,667
I've told you before
it doesn't matter what I think.

117
00:04:55,718 --> 00:04:58,136
But if you think saying you're
innocent is gonna make people

118
00:04:58,204 --> 00:04:59,704
believe you, it won't.

119
00:04:59,756 --> 00:05:01,973
Because you know who says
they're innocent?

120
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:03,208
Everybody.

121
00:05:03,276 --> 00:05:05,727
Every day
I keep my mouth shut

122
00:05:05,812 --> 00:05:07,646
our stock takes a dive,

123
00:05:07,713 --> 00:05:09,564
and that makes me vulnerable.

124
00:05:09,649 --> 00:05:10,565
I get it.

125
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:11,850
You want to convince the world

126
00:05:11,851 --> 00:05:13,318
you're not responsible
for these murders

127
00:05:13,385 --> 00:05:14,986
so you can keep control
of your big oil company.

128
00:05:15,054 --> 00:05:16,571
That is not what I said.

129
00:05:16,656 --> 00:05:19,157
Well, that's how Cameron
Dennis is gonna make it sound.

130
00:05:19,225 --> 00:05:22,527
Ava, you're on trial
for your life.

131
00:05:22,578 --> 00:05:24,162
This company is my life.

132
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:26,364
And that's exactly
what it's gonna look like--

133
00:05:26,416 --> 00:05:29,334
a greedy oil exec
clinging to her money factory

134
00:05:29,401 --> 00:05:31,002
with her blood-stained hands.

135
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:32,504
Very well.

136
00:05:32,571 --> 00:05:34,923
You've made your point.

137
00:05:35,007 --> 00:05:39,094
Now I suggest you find a way
to get me out of both situations

138
00:05:39,178 --> 00:05:41,513
'cause I am not losing control
of Hessington Oil

139
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:43,748

What's the occasion?

152
00:06:29,504 --> 00:06:31,472
Does a girl need a reason

153
00:06:31,539 --> 00:06:34,141
Sugar me.

154
00:06:34,208 --> 00:06:37,043
Um, before anyone sugars
anyone, if you two are dating,

155
00:06:37,095 --> 00:06:38,379
you need to know that we have

156
00:06:38,446 --> 00:06:41,315
a very strict policy
in favor of that.

157
00:06:41,383 --> 00:06:43,817
And we have
a very strict policy

158
00:06:43,885 --> 00:06:45,903
to keep our sugar
to ourselves.

159
00:06:45,987 --> 00:06:49,323
Oh, that's a pity.

160
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:53,160
I'm partial to a little
sweetness in the morning.

161
00:06:53,228 --> 00:06:55,579
Well, then I would recommend
the bakery on 52nd.

162
00:06:55,663 --> 00:06:56,830
You care to join me?

163
00:06:56,898 --> 00:06:58,832
I hate to deny you the pleasure
of my company.

164
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:01,335
I think I can manage
without it.

165
00:07:01,402 --> 00:07:03,087
Since you're
from a different country,

166
00:07:03,171 --> 00:07:06,090
"She finds you
a bit douchey, love."

167
00:07:06,174 --> 00:07:08,258
My loss.

168
00:07:12,764 --> 00:07:14,736
Ladies.

169
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:20,754
Oh, that man is trouble.

170
00:07:20,805 --> 00:07:21,855
It's okay.
I can handle it.

171
00:07:21,923 --> 00:07:23,107
Oh, no, it's okay.

172
00:07:23,191 --> 00:07:24,725
I don't need you to.

173
00:07:24,776 --> 00:07:27,144
Wait.
What are we talking about?

174
00:07:27,228 --> 00:07:28,645
The fact
that he's into me.

175
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:30,364
Were you here?
He's into me.

176
00:07:30,431 --> 00:07:32,449
Then why was I the one
getting all the stares?

177
00:07:32,534 --> 00:07:35,569
Haven't you ever heard,
"go after the second prettiest

178
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:36,820
to get
the prettiest's attention"?

179
00:07:36,905 --> 00:07:38,622
No, I've never heard that.

180
00:07:38,706 --> 00:07:40,207
- Well, it's a thing.
- Oh.

181
00:07:40,274 --> 00:07:42,960
Are you saying
I'm the second prettiest?

182
00:07:43,044 --> 00:07:47,881
I'm saying you are to him.

183
00:07:47,949 --> 00:07:50,617
Oh, the dress.

184
00:07:50,668 --> 00:07:52,052
He asked you out?
Last week.

185
00:07:52,119 --> 00:07:53,170
- And?
- I passed.

186
00:07:53,254 --> 00:07:54,638
- Why?
- Why should I go out with him?

187
00:07:54,722 --> 00:07:55,923
Just because he's charming
and hot?

188
00:07:55,974 --> 00:07:57,841
- And witty and British.
- And has a title.

189
00:07:57,926 --> 00:07:58,892
- He does?
- No.

190
00:07:58,960 --> 00:07:59,893
But even if he did,

191
00:07:59,961 --> 00:08:01,094
that wouldn't be a reason.

192
00:08:01,146 --> 00:08:02,626
I told you, Rach,
I don't mix business

193
00:08:02,647 --> 00:08:04,565
with pleasure.
Business?

194
00:08:04,632 --> 00:08:06,066
He's only here
for six weeks.

195
00:08:06,133 --> 00:08:08,485
And he is based
out of London.

196
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:11,471
It's practically
a different company.

197
00:08:11,523 --> 00:08:12,573
And it's definitely
a different country.

198
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,074
- So you'll consider it?
- Nope.

199
00:08:14,141 --> 00:08:16,810
Well

200
00:08:18,947 --> 00:08:20,497
What's going on
with Ava Hessington?

201
00:08:20,582 --> 00:08:23,167
I convinced her
not to give an interview.

202
00:08:23,251 --> 00:08:24,751
How'd she get it in her head
it'd be a good idea

203
00:08:24,819 --> 00:08:26,086
in the first place?
Louis.

204
00:08:26,153 --> 00:08:27,821
Is he aware
she's up for murder?

205
00:08:27,889 --> 00:08:29,873
Is he aware that most people
don't line their offices

206
00:08:29,958 --> 00:08:32,509
with pictures of themselves?
Evidently not.

207
00:08:32,594 --> 00:08:34,094
You know he's still got one
of his dead cat?

208
00:08:34,161 --> 00:08:36,363
Harvey, leave the cat alone.

209
00:08:36,431 --> 00:08:38,665
Stupid cat.

210
00:08:38,716 --> 00:08:41,301
How dare
you sabotage my case?

211
00:08:41,352 --> 00:08:42,502
I didn't sabotage shit.

212
00:08:42,554 --> 00:08:44,104
You set that thing up
behind my back

213
00:08:44,171 --> 00:08:45,138
and you didn't tell me about it

214
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:46,557
until you thought
it was too late.

215
00:08:46,641 --> 00:08:48,058
Yeah, because I knew
the minute things heated up

216
00:08:48,142 --> 00:08:50,143
on the takeover attempt,
you'd want to take my case back.

217
00:08:50,195 --> 00:08:51,862
Take your case back?

218
00:08:51,946 --> 00:08:54,147
I don't know how familiar
you are with the game of law,

219
00:08:54,199 --> 00:08:55,716
but murder trumps takeover.

220
00:08:55,783 --> 00:08:58,402
- You condescending piece of--
- Louis.

221
00:08:58,486 --> 00:08:59,903
Harvey's right.

222
00:08:59,988 --> 00:09:01,288
The woman
can't make public statements

223
00:09:01,355 --> 00:09:03,690
while she's on trial for murder.
Trump.

224
00:09:03,741 --> 00:09:05,191
Well, if she's gonna keep
her mouth shut,

225
00:09:05,243 --> 00:09:07,027
then she's gonna have
to step down

226
00:09:07,078 --> 00:09:08,212
or we're gonna lose this vote.
Asking her to step down

227
00:09:08,296 --> 00:09:09,362
would be asking her
to cut off her arm.

228
00:09:09,414 --> 00:09:10,547
If we don't cut off her arm,
Harvey,

229
00:09:10,632 --> 00:09:11,965
we're gonna lose the patient.

230
00:09:12,033 --> 00:09:13,800
She's my client.
I'm not gonna let that happen.

231
00:09:13,868 --> 00:09:15,168
Ava Hessington
is not my client.

232
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:16,920
Hessington Oil is.

233
00:09:17,005 --> 00:09:19,673
And they generate $14 million
a year in billables.

234
00:09:19,724 --> 00:09:20,974
Have you not been listening?

235
00:09:21,042 --> 00:09:23,060
Ava Hessington
is Hessington Oil.

236
00:09:23,144 --> 00:09:24,094
Not for long.

237
00:09:24,178 --> 00:09:26,346
- Excuse me?
- Louis is right.

238
00:09:26,397 --> 00:09:28,548
If she steps down now,

239
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,817
we can still win the vote
and keep them as a client.

240
00:09:30,885 --> 00:09:32,385
Well, who's gonna convince her
to do that?

241
00:09:32,437 --> 00:09:33,437
We don't have
to convince her.

242
00:09:33,521 --> 00:09:34,821
We can just go to the board.

243
00:09:34,889 --> 00:09:35,939
We don't even have to tell her.
Like hell you will.

244
00:09:36,024 --> 00:09:37,557
And like hell I won't.

245
00:09:37,609 --> 00:09:39,326
Harvey, this needs to happen.

246
00:09:39,393 --> 00:09:42,613
- No, I won't do it.
- This is my call.

247
00:09:42,697 --> 00:09:46,333
I'm afraid it isn't.

248
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,568
Excuse me?

249
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:51,738
You and I both know
who assigned me to this case,

250
00:09:51,789 --> 00:09:53,457
and it wasn't you.

251
00:09:53,541 --> 00:09:56,009
It was the man you chose
to merge with.

252
00:09:56,077 --> 00:09:59,463
The same man who has a 51% share
of our law firm.

253
00:09:59,547 --> 00:10:01,682
So unless
you're gonna undo that,

254
00:10:01,749 --> 00:10:06,586
you're gonna live with this.

255
00:10:06,638 --> 00:10:07,721
Was she pissed?

256
00:10:07,772 --> 00:10:09,306
I bet she was pissed.

257
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:10,440
Not as pissed
as you're gonna be.

258
00:10:10,525 --> 00:10:11,942
What are you talking about?

259
00:10:12,026 --> 00:10:14,361
You're on Katrina duty
for the next two days.

260
00:10:14,428 --> 00:10:15,979
What?
I'd rather be on latrine duty.

261
00:10:16,064 --> 00:10:18,282
- It's not an option.
- Okay, then I'm going AWOL.

262
00:10:18,366 --> 00:10:21,101
Well, let me connect
the dots for you, Forrest Gump.

263
00:10:21,152 --> 00:10:23,453
Even though Jessica gave in
on the strategy,

264
00:10:23,538 --> 00:10:25,989
Louis made it clear he's willing
to sacrifice Ava.

265
00:10:26,074 --> 00:10:27,774
And you don't trust him
to play by the rules.

266
00:10:27,825 --> 00:10:30,610
Which is why you're gonna work
side by side with her

267
00:10:30,662 --> 00:10:32,296
to figure a way out of this jam.

268
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:35,132
And at the same time make sure
she and Louis don't shaft us.

269
00:10:35,216 --> 00:10:36,550
Not bad, Forrest.

270
00:10:36,617 --> 00:10:38,635
Okay, if I'm Forrest,
then you're Bubba.

271
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,138
- Shrimpin' bidness.
- Harvey...

272
00:10:41,222 --> 00:10:42,455
If Ava loses her company,

273
00:10:42,507 --> 00:10:44,508
will Darby still back you
as managing partner?

274
00:10:44,592 --> 00:10:47,811
I didn't ask,
but I sure as hell wouldn't.

275
00:10:54,352 --> 00:10:55,635
What is it, Louis?

276
00:10:55,687 --> 00:10:58,405
I just wanted to thank you
for backing me earlier.

277
00:10:58,472 --> 00:11:00,473
I had your back because you
had the best strategy.

278
00:11:00,525 --> 00:11:01,858
It still means a lot to me.

279
00:11:01,943 --> 00:11:03,076
And, you know, I don't know
where Harvey gets off

280
00:11:03,144 --> 00:11:04,277
telling you how to run things.

281
00:11:04,329 --> 00:11:06,363
It's over, Louis.
I'm moving on.

282
00:11:06,447 --> 00:11:09,816
It doesn't have to be.

283
00:11:09,867 --> 00:11:12,336
What exactly
are you proposing?

284
00:11:18,626 --> 00:11:21,044
Allow me to be
your black swan.

285
00:11:21,129 --> 00:11:23,430
Let me do the things
that your position precludes you

286
00:11:23,497 --> 00:11:27,500
from doing, the dark choices,
the distasteful wet work.

287
00:11:27,552 --> 00:11:30,504
You mean like using lye
to dissolve a human body?

288
00:11:30,571 --> 00:11:33,506
I mean using lies to dislodge
a pesky CEO.

289
00:11:33,558 --> 00:11:34,775
Well, we've been told
that's not an option.

290
00:11:34,842 --> 00:11:36,509
Not for you, maybe,
but as we just agreed,

291
00:11:36,561 --> 00:11:38,345
it's the right option
for the board.

292
00:11:38,413 --> 00:11:41,648
And Harvey and his master Lord
Poppycock don't have to know.

293
00:11:41,699 --> 00:11:45,786
Louis, I appreciate
your offer, I do, but--

294
00:11:45,853 --> 00:11:48,655
But the one time
you take my side over his,

295
00:11:48,706 --> 00:11:50,067
you're not willing
to fight for it.

296
00:11:50,074 --> 00:11:51,324
I'm willing to fight.

297
00:11:51,376 --> 00:11:52,826
I just won't do it
behind Darby's back.

298
00:11:52,877 --> 00:11:54,628
Look, I swear
it'll never come back to you.

299
00:11:54,695 --> 00:11:58,215
I didn't say I was afraid
to get caught.

300
00:11:58,299 --> 00:12:00,417
I said I don't want
to operate that way.

301
00:12:00,501 --> 00:12:01,885
Now if you'll excuse me.

302
00:12:01,969 --> 00:12:03,920
Need I remind you you had me
go behind Harvey's back

303
00:12:04,005 --> 00:12:05,538
to do the same thing
with McKernon Motors?

304
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:07,040
That was not the same.

305
00:12:07,091 --> 00:12:08,975
I get it.

306
00:12:09,043 --> 00:12:11,011
You were in charge then.

307
00:12:11,062 --> 00:12:14,064
You're not in charge anymore.

308
00:12:23,205 --> 00:12:24,801
Hey

309
00:12:24,802 --> 00:12:26,122
Ooh, all jammed up?

310
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:28,042
I'm afraid so.

311
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:29,510
You just need to coax it
a little.

312
00:12:30,178 --> 00:12:31,145
Oh, and how does one
do that?

313
00:12:31,212 --> 00:12:32,730
Oh, it's all in the touch.

314
00:12:32,814 --> 00:12:35,265
Well, I've been nothing
but gentle.

315
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:36,350
There's a time to be gentle,

316
00:12:36,401 --> 00:12:39,403
and there's a time
to be firm.

317
00:12:39,487 --> 00:12:44,358
You should see
how I handle the fax.

318
00:12:44,409 --> 00:12:46,493
I can imagine.

319
00:12:46,561 --> 00:12:48,001
You know, in fact,
given your skills,

320
00:12:48,062 --> 00:12:50,447
I think you'd probably be
the ideal person

321
00:12:50,532 --> 00:12:52,499
to handle my short-term needs.

322
00:12:52,567 --> 00:12:54,785
See, I'm in the states
on a limited basis,

323
00:12:54,869 --> 00:12:57,955
and I've got nobody to help me
with my workload.

324
00:12:58,039 --> 00:12:59,623
I get it.

325
00:12:59,708 --> 00:13:01,742
You're forced
to do everything yourself.

326
00:13:01,793 --> 00:13:03,761
It's getting exhausting.

327
00:13:03,845 --> 00:13:08,799
And you need someone
to help relieve the pressure.

328
00:13:08,883 --> 00:13:10,184
Naturally, I thought of you.

329
00:13:10,251 --> 00:13:11,602
Not Rachel?

330
00:13:11,686 --> 00:13:12,919
I think you know
the answer to that.

331
00:13:12,971 --> 00:13:14,104
I knew it then.

332
00:13:14,189 --> 00:13:16,190
I know you did.

333
00:13:16,257 --> 00:13:19,092
It'll be a brief,
casual arrangement

334
00:13:19,144 --> 00:13:20,310
whilst I'm in New York.

335
00:13:20,395 --> 00:13:22,312
I wouldn't have time
for anything more.

336
00:13:22,397 --> 00:13:24,198
Then we have
an agreement?

337
00:13:24,265 --> 00:13:26,433
I don't know.

338
00:13:26,484 --> 00:13:28,368
What kind of boss would you be?

339
00:13:28,436 --> 00:13:30,237
Demanding.

340
00:13:30,288 --> 00:13:32,489
But very generous.
Generous is good.

341
00:13:32,574 --> 00:13:36,493
As is Daniel Day-Lewis
doing <i>MacBeth.</i>

342
00:13:36,578 --> 00:13:38,996
You do realize
that this arrangement

343
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,831
would involve
no secretarial work?

344
00:13:40,915 --> 00:13:44,168
I'd be disappointed
if it did.

345
00:13:50,008 --> 00:13:52,643
- Katrina Bennett.
- At your service.

346
00:13:52,727 --> 00:13:54,895
- God, I love the sound of that.
- Your wish is my command.

347
00:13:54,962 --> 00:13:56,814
- My wish is for you--
- To work hand in glove

348
00:13:56,898 --> 00:13:58,899
with Mike Ross on getting rid
of Tony Gianopolous,

349
00:13:58,966 --> 00:14:00,651
keep an eye
on what they're doing

350
00:14:00,735 --> 00:14:02,069
while at the same time
limit their understanding

351
00:14:02,136 --> 00:14:03,470
of what we're doing.
How do you know all that?

352
00:14:03,521 --> 00:14:04,721
- It's my job.
- Wait a minute.

353
00:14:04,739 --> 00:14:05,856
I thought you can't stand
Mike Ross.

354
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:07,157
All of a sudden
you're willing to work with him?

355
00:14:07,242 --> 00:14:09,493
- It's my job.
- If I ask you to murder someone

356
00:14:09,577 --> 00:14:11,612
on a rainy winter's eve,
how would you respond?

357
00:14:11,663 --> 00:14:14,665
You want a gun or a knife?

358
00:14:14,749 --> 00:14:16,817
If you were less attractive,
I'd love you.

359
00:14:16,868 --> 00:14:20,454
I know.

360
00:14:20,505 --> 00:14:23,490
Louis, why aren't we
just kicking Ava Hessington out?

361
00:14:23,541 --> 00:14:25,425
She'd be gone before
she even knew what hit her.

362
00:14:25,493 --> 00:14:26,877
If Harvey had
half your brains,

363
00:14:26,961 --> 00:14:28,282
that's exactly
what we'd be doing.

364
00:14:28,296 --> 00:14:29,880
But he doesn't,
and as much as I hate

365
00:14:29,964 --> 00:14:32,332
to admit it, he's in charge
of this decision.

366
00:14:32,383 --> 00:14:34,218
He's not in charge
of this firm.

367
00:14:34,302 --> 00:14:36,270
Go to Jessica,
she'll agree with you,

368
00:14:36,337 --> 00:14:38,722
you'll get the credit,
and Harvey will be

369
00:14:38,807 --> 00:14:40,390
off Hessington Oil before
he even knows what hit him.

370
00:14:40,475 --> 00:14:43,861
Katrina, as much
as I appreciate your suggestion,

371
00:14:43,945 --> 00:14:46,113
I refuse to operate
in a duplicitous manner.

372
00:14:48,449 --> 00:14:52,903
Then I'll find us a way to get
rid of Tony Gianopolous anyway.

373
00:14:55,957 --> 00:14:57,875
Ahahah-ah.

374
00:14:57,959 --> 00:14:59,526
I might have to let you look
at what I've got,

375
00:14:59,577 --> 00:15:01,245
but I don't have
to let you touch it.

376
00:15:01,329 --> 00:15:03,363
Touch it?

377
00:15:03,414 --> 00:15:04,882
This room is a disaster.

378
00:15:04,966 --> 00:15:06,834
This room is fine.

379
00:15:06,885 --> 00:15:10,871
I know where everything is
and what everything is.

380
00:15:13,341 --> 00:15:15,225
What are you even doing?

381
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:16,593
Finding dirt on Gianopolous.

382
00:15:16,678 --> 00:15:18,061
You're dealing with one

383
00:15:18,146 --> 00:15:19,596
of the most sophisticated
raiders in the world.

384
00:15:19,681 --> 00:15:21,361
He's not leaving a trail
for you to follow.

385
00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:23,383
Oh, yeah?
And what's your strategy?

386
00:15:23,434 --> 00:15:26,052
You gonna record him and make
an embarrassing video?

387
00:15:26,104 --> 00:15:28,989
No.
Gonna play a little game.

388
00:15:29,056 --> 00:15:32,109
Monopoly?

389
00:15:32,193 --> 00:15:33,243
You don't think
I started with that?

390
00:15:33,328 --> 00:15:34,778
There's no way to have
a monopoly

391
00:15:34,863 --> 00:15:36,864
in the oil business.
It's too goddamn big.

392
00:15:36,915 --> 00:15:38,498
And even if you could,
these are all the companies

393
00:15:38,566 --> 00:15:40,417
that Gianopolous owns
in any way,

394
00:15:40,501 --> 00:15:42,903
and these are the biggest
companies in the oil industry.

395
00:15:42,954 --> 00:15:46,089
There's no way
to connect the dots.

396
00:15:46,174 --> 00:15:49,259
Well, do you want to go
down the same road and have

397
00:15:49,344 --> 00:15:51,077
another fight or do you want
to try to figure out a way--

398
00:15:51,129 --> 00:15:53,413
- Shit.
- What?

399
00:15:55,884 --> 00:15:59,019
We've been looking
in the wrong place.

400
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:07,978
Shit.

401
00:16:10,031 --> 00:16:11,865
Shit.

402
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:19,439
ShTy shit.

403
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:21,825
<i>Shit.</i>

404
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:25,162
You're into <i>The Wire?</i>

405
00:16:29,667 --> 00:16:31,785
shit.

406
00:16:42,397 --> 00:16:43,814
Jessica.

407
00:16:43,898 --> 00:16:46,934
What a lovely coincidence
running into you in Toronto.

408
00:16:46,985 --> 00:16:48,635
This is not a coincidence.

409
00:16:48,703 --> 00:16:50,383
Well, I hope it's still going
to be lovely.

410
00:16:50,405 --> 00:16:53,573
I need you to make it
perfectly clear to Harvey

411
00:16:53,641 --> 00:16:54,975
that he has no say

412
00:16:55,026 --> 00:16:56,827
in the Hessington Oil
takeover battle.

413
00:16:56,911 --> 00:16:58,478
And why would I do that?

414
00:16:58,529 --> 00:17:00,030
Because he's making
a huge mistake and using

415
00:17:00,114 --> 00:17:01,665
your name to do it.
And let me guess,

416
00:17:01,749 --> 00:17:03,917
you'd like her to remove herself
from management.

417
00:17:03,985 --> 00:17:05,819
She can do it herself,

418
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:07,504
or I can do it for her.

419
00:17:07,588 --> 00:17:10,590
But either way
she's got to go

420
00:17:10,658 --> 00:17:11,825
until this trial is over.

421
00:17:11,876 --> 00:17:13,427
I'm afraid
I don't see it that way.

422
00:17:13,494 --> 00:17:14,544
Well, you're wrong.

423
00:17:14,629 --> 00:17:17,681
And you're overstepping.

424
00:17:17,765 --> 00:17:20,133
Listen to me.

425
00:17:20,184 --> 00:17:23,103
She stands to lose control
of this company permanently

426
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:24,187
if we don't do something.

427
00:17:24,272 --> 00:17:25,856
Then do something.

428
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:29,192
I'm trying,
but you're cutting off my legs

429
00:17:29,277 --> 00:17:31,061
because of a bond you had
with her father.

430
00:17:31,145 --> 00:17:34,014
No, because I value
relationships over money.

431
00:17:34,082 --> 00:17:36,700
Well, I value the terms
of our merger.

432
00:17:36,784 --> 00:17:39,119
And Hessington Oil was one
of your biggest selling points.

433
00:17:39,186 --> 00:17:41,288
And Harvey Specter
one of yours.

434
00:17:41,355 --> 00:17:43,235
I'm not going to stand
for losing this takeover.

435
00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:47,210
Then don't.
But Ava isn't going anywhere.

436
00:17:47,295 --> 00:17:49,363
One more thing.

437
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:51,365
Instead of spending firm money
to fly

438
00:17:51,432 --> 00:17:53,367
to another country
to question my judgment,

439
00:17:53,434 --> 00:17:54,835
feel free to call first.

440
00:17:54,886 --> 00:17:57,637
I'll be happy to give you
the same answer over the phone.

441
00:18:02,877 --> 00:18:04,311
This is brilliant.

442
00:18:04,378 --> 00:18:05,729
We've got the connection.

443
00:18:05,813 --> 00:18:07,564
We just need to figure out
how to stop it.

444
00:18:07,648 --> 00:18:10,233
I already have.

445
00:18:10,318 --> 00:18:12,552
This is great work, Katrina.
You struck oil.

446
00:18:12,603 --> 00:18:15,572
It was actually Mike's idea.

447
00:18:15,656 --> 00:18:16,823
Why do you want
to give him credit?

448
00:18:16,891 --> 00:18:18,775
Because if I don't,
you won't listen

449
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:20,277
when I say
you should take him with you.

450
00:18:20,361 --> 00:18:21,661
I'm not taking anyone
with me.

451
00:18:21,729 --> 00:18:24,281
It's an opportunity
for him to see you

452
00:18:24,365 --> 00:18:26,533
beat the shit
out of a living legend.

453
00:18:28,736 --> 00:18:30,871
Tony Gianopolous
gets blown out of the water,

454
00:18:30,922 --> 00:18:31,955
and Mike gets blown away.

455
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,757
And Jessica hears
about it all.

456
00:18:33,841 --> 00:18:35,759
I'm gonna suggest this
to Harvey.

457
00:18:35,843 --> 00:18:37,794
Feel free to tell him
it was all your idea.

458
00:18:37,879 --> 00:18:41,431
Don't mind if I do.
Oh, perfect timing.

459
00:18:41,516 --> 00:18:42,599
Harvey, I was just gonna run
something by you.

460
00:18:42,683 --> 00:18:43,850
I don't have time, Louis.

461
00:18:43,918 --> 00:18:45,469
I'm working on a murder case.

462
00:18:45,553 --> 00:18:47,254
I just dropped by to inform you

463
00:18:47,321 --> 00:18:50,140
Mike's coming with you
to see Gianopolous.

464
00:18:50,224 --> 00:18:51,758
Like hell he is.

465
00:18:51,826 --> 00:18:53,977
- Excuse me?
- I'm not taking anyone.

466
00:18:54,062 --> 00:18:55,612
- Louis--
- And don't Louis me.

467
00:18:55,696 --> 00:18:57,597
This is my case, and you've
been sticking your nose in it

468
00:18:57,648 --> 00:18:59,950
ever since I got it.
Sticking my nose in?

469
00:19:00,034 --> 00:19:01,201
You only have this case

470
00:19:01,268 --> 00:19:02,769
'cause I was kind enough
to give it to you.

471
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:05,122
You only gave it to me
because you hadn't realized

472
00:19:05,206 --> 00:19:07,273
that you were responsible for
turning Ava's bribery charges

473
00:19:07,325 --> 00:19:08,625
into murder charges.

474
00:19:08,709 --> 00:19:10,944
- You're off this case.
- Go ahead.

475
00:19:10,995 --> 00:19:12,546
Call Ava.

476
00:19:12,613 --> 00:19:13,997
Tell her that you're diverting
your attention

477
00:19:14,082 --> 00:19:16,133
from her murder trial
to work on this.

478
00:19:16,217 --> 00:19:18,952
Yup.
Didn't think so.

479
00:19:19,003 --> 00:19:20,620
Get out of my office
because I got a meeting

480
00:19:20,671 --> 00:19:22,756
to prepare for.

481
00:19:26,961 --> 00:19:28,678
What just happened to him?

482
00:19:28,763 --> 00:19:30,647
- He got "Litt" up.
- Damn straight.

483
00:19:33,156 --> 00:19:34,312
Have you seen this?

484
00:19:34,313 --> 00:19:35,346
It's an article,

485
00:19:35,431 --> 00:19:36,647
in today's <i>Wall Street Journal</i>

486
00:19:36,732 --> 00:19:38,232
painting me as the picture
of corporate greed.

487
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:40,067
As I told you before,
if you speak out--

488
00:19:40,135 --> 00:19:42,403
I have the chance
to save my company.

489
00:19:42,471 --> 00:19:44,494
Louis Litt is doing that
right now.

490
00:19:44,503 --> 00:19:46,263
- That is not the point.
- That is the point.

491
00:19:46,338 --> 00:19:47,871
We can still save your company,

492
00:19:47,923 --> 00:19:49,924
and you won't have to hurt
yourself at your murder trial.

493
00:19:50,008 --> 00:19:52,876
No, the point is I want
to speak at my murder trial.

494
00:19:52,928 --> 00:19:53,928
That's not wise.

495
00:19:54,012 --> 00:19:55,146
And how many murder trials

496
00:19:55,213 --> 00:19:56,714
have you conducted
in your many years?

497
00:19:56,765 --> 00:19:58,899
- Ava.
- Silence is damning.

498
00:19:58,984 --> 00:20:01,235
Look at this article.
I'm already guilty.

499
00:20:01,319 --> 00:20:02,403
If you take the stand,

500
00:20:02,487 --> 00:20:04,822
Cameron Dennis is gonna rip you
to shreds.

501
00:20:04,889 --> 00:20:07,441
This is not up for discussion.
I will have my say.

502
00:20:07,526 --> 00:20:09,410
Then I'm gonna show you
what you're in for.

503
00:20:09,494 --> 00:20:11,662
Well, you wouldn't be doing
your job if you didn't.

504
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:19,503
Have a seat,
Mr. Litt.

505
00:20:19,571 --> 00:20:21,238
I'll be with you
in a minute.

506
00:20:21,289 --> 00:20:22,757
You'll be with me?

507
00:20:22,841 --> 00:20:25,342
Yes. As I said.
In a minute.

508
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:26,577
Uhhuh.

509
00:20:26,645 --> 00:20:27,962
Well, you know,
I'd ask you who you are,

510
00:20:28,046 --> 00:20:31,248
but the truth is I, uh...

511
00:20:31,299 --> 00:20:33,250
I don't really give a shit.

512
00:20:33,301 --> 00:20:34,969
Where the hell's
Tony Gianopolous?

513
00:20:35,053 --> 00:20:36,804
Mr. Gianopolous is upstairs.

514
00:20:36,888 --> 00:20:39,273
To get upstairs, you have to get
through those doors.

515
00:20:39,357 --> 00:20:41,726
And to get through those doors
you have to get through me.

516
00:20:41,777 --> 00:20:44,478
And you're not getting
through me.

517
00:20:46,398 --> 00:20:51,118
Well, perhaps I have the key.

518
00:20:53,938 --> 00:20:56,440
This is a balance sheet
from one of our subsidiaries.

519
00:20:56,491 --> 00:20:57,875
This is nothing.

520
00:20:57,942 --> 00:20:58,993
Sorry.
Forgot.

521
00:20:59,077 --> 00:21:01,612
It's a combination lock.

522
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:04,782
This represents the totality
of Gianopolous Limited holdings.

523
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:07,468
You control 40%
of the U.S. radio stations,

524
00:21:07,552 --> 00:21:09,136
corn production,
interstate trucking,

525
00:21:09,221 --> 00:21:10,387
and that's just the tip
of the iceberg.

526
00:21:10,455 --> 00:21:12,089
Looks like I picked
the right employer.

527
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:14,759
Hessington Oil
owns enough of those industries

528
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:17,895
to get you in trouble
with the FTC.

529
00:21:17,962 --> 00:21:20,297
Yeah.
Think we wouldn't find that?

530
00:21:20,348 --> 00:21:22,133
You think we wouldn't?

531
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,434
These folders are out of date.

532
00:21:23,485 --> 00:21:24,485
We've already divested.

533
00:21:24,569 --> 00:21:28,972
Into this, this, and this.

534
00:21:29,024 --> 00:21:32,309
So what? Hessington doesn't
have holdings in those areas.

535
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:34,311
They do now.

536
00:21:34,362 --> 00:21:35,663
And if you don't leave 'em
alone,

537
00:21:35,747 --> 00:21:37,481
you're gonna be tied up
with my friend from the FTC

538
00:21:37,532 --> 00:21:40,334
until kingdom goddamn come.

539
00:21:40,418 --> 00:21:43,521
Got that, spank?

540
00:21:43,588 --> 00:21:45,289
Then it's a good thing
Mr. Gianopolous

541
00:21:45,357 --> 00:21:48,008
arranged an exception for us
over dinner with his friend,

542
00:21:48,093 --> 00:21:53,047
the commissioner of the FTC.

543
00:21:53,131 --> 00:21:54,765
- That's not--
- Legal?

544
00:21:54,833 --> 00:21:56,717
Yes, it is.
As long as we disclose it.

545
00:21:56,802 --> 00:21:58,352
Which we always do.

546
00:21:58,436 --> 00:21:59,854
You think
you're the first lawyer

547
00:21:59,938 --> 00:22:01,171
to try to outsmart us?

548
00:22:01,223 --> 00:22:02,306
We're not lawyers.

549
00:22:02,357 --> 00:22:03,357
We're investment bankers.

550
00:22:03,358 --> 00:22:04,341
We call you for the paperwork.

551
00:22:04,392 --> 00:22:05,776
We didn't go to Harvard.

552
00:22:05,844 --> 00:22:07,945
We went to Wharton,
and we saw you coming

553
00:22:08,012 --> 00:22:10,281
a mile away.

554
00:22:10,348 --> 00:22:13,067
Spank.

555
00:22:13,151 --> 00:22:15,619
Oh, by the way, Mr. Gianopolous
is in Monaco.

556
00:22:15,687 --> 00:22:19,206
Christina will validate you
on the way out.

557
00:22:21,743 --> 00:22:25,913
Finally cleaning up?

558
00:22:25,997 --> 00:22:28,215
Can't stay here forever.

559
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:30,968
How'd your meeting
with Ava go?

560
00:22:31,035 --> 00:22:32,920
She wants to testify
at her own trial.

561
00:22:33,004 --> 00:22:35,038
- Are you kidding?
- Yeah, I know.

562
00:22:35,090 --> 00:22:36,140
We're working on it.

563
00:22:36,207 --> 00:22:37,875
Thought you'd be with Louis.

564
00:22:37,926 --> 00:22:40,711
He went to go see Gianopolous
by himself.

565
00:22:40,779 --> 00:22:43,063
I hope it works.

566
00:22:43,148 --> 00:22:45,733
We have a good plan.

567
00:22:45,817 --> 00:22:49,069
For what it's worth,

568
00:22:49,154 --> 00:22:52,156
I suggested Louis
take you with him.

569
00:22:54,058 --> 00:22:55,159
Shit.

570
00:22:56,611 --> 00:22:57,945
As Sil would say,

571
00:22:58,029 --> 00:23:00,063
"just when I thought I was out,

572
00:23:00,115 --> 00:23:01,699
they pull me back in."

573
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:03,918
Okay, so you watch
<i>The Sopranos</i> too?

574
00:23:04,002 --> 00:23:05,169
Nobody watches <i>The Wire</i>

575
00:23:05,236 --> 00:23:08,289
without starting
with <i>The Sopranos.</i>

576
00:23:10,374 --> 00:23:13,530
You, uh, you really
suggest that to Louis?

577
00:23:14,397 --> 00:23:17,666
It was your idea.
You deserve the credit.

578
00:23:22,372 --> 00:23:24,707
Truce?

579
00:23:24,758 --> 00:23:28,427
Truce.

580
00:23:28,511 --> 00:23:31,430
Shit.

581
00:23:33,633 --> 00:23:36,685
You trying to score some extra
edamame from the delivery guy?

582
00:23:36,753 --> 00:23:40,022
Please, Yuki always brings me
extra edamame.

583
00:23:40,089 --> 00:23:43,091
Well, then who's
the touch-up for?

584
00:23:43,143 --> 00:23:48,113
And did you do a costume change
without leaving the office?

585
00:23:48,198 --> 00:23:50,783
I have a number
that calls a guy...

586
00:23:50,867 --> 00:23:52,347
Who knows my size.
I need that number.

587
00:23:52,402 --> 00:23:54,820
- I can't give you that number.
- Mm.

588
00:23:54,905 --> 00:23:58,324
Oh, my God.
You have a date with Stephen.

589
00:23:58,408 --> 00:24:00,108
It's not really a date.

590
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:02,294
It's more...

591
00:24:02,379 --> 00:24:04,997
of an arrangement.
An arrangement?

592
00:24:05,081 --> 00:24:07,466
He has some short-term needs,
asked if I could help him out

593
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:09,117
while he's in town,
blah blah blah,

594
00:24:09,169 --> 00:24:10,669
I'm meeting him at 8:00.

595
00:24:10,754 --> 00:24:12,838
Blah blah blah?

596
00:24:12,923 --> 00:24:14,056
What's blah blah blah?

597
00:24:14,123 --> 00:24:16,392
Oh, you know,
it's just...

598
00:24:16,459 --> 00:24:18,293
This, that, and the other thing.
Uhhuh.

599
00:24:18,345 --> 00:24:21,013
And does he know
that blah blah blah constitutes

600
00:24:21,097 --> 00:24:23,065
this, that, and the other thing?
Rachel.

601
00:24:23,132 --> 00:24:25,985
Stephen and I communicate
a little more subtly--

602
00:24:26,069 --> 00:24:28,771
suggestive banter,
double entendres.

603
00:24:28,822 --> 00:24:30,406
We both know
what we agreed to.

604
00:24:30,473 --> 00:24:31,440
It sounds to me
like you agreed

605
00:24:31,491 --> 00:24:32,825
to a hot and steamy affair.

606
00:24:32,909 --> 00:24:35,143
I'm not gonna even
dignify that with a response.

607
00:24:35,195 --> 00:24:37,913
Oh, my God, did you agree
to a hot and steamy affair?

608
00:24:37,981 --> 00:24:39,915
I have no idea.

609
00:24:44,371 --> 00:24:47,172
- Louis, what can I do for you?
- I want off this case.

610
00:24:47,257 --> 00:24:48,323
I take it you struck out
with Gianopolous?

611
00:24:48,375 --> 00:24:49,658
I didn't strike out.

612
00:24:49,709 --> 00:24:51,093
What I did was almost pull
a rabbit out of a hat.

613
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:53,345
But the truth is
the one good move we had

614
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:54,763
has been taken away from us,

615
00:24:54,831 --> 00:24:56,098
and I'm not gonna be left
holding the bag

616
00:24:56,165 --> 00:24:57,883
because Harvey chose
to handcuff me.

617
00:24:57,968 --> 00:25:02,354
Louis, I'm not taking you
off this case.

618
00:25:02,439 --> 00:25:04,556
But I am taking
the handcuffs off.

619
00:25:06,526 --> 00:25:10,112
Wait, are you saying
that I have your blessing

620
00:25:10,179 --> 00:25:13,565
to go to the board and convince
them to ditch Ava Hessington?

621
00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:16,311
I'm not saying anything.

622
00:25:16,312 --> 00:25:17,812
Got it.

623
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,931
Wet work.

624
00:25:20,016 --> 00:25:24,052
This conversation
never happened.

625
00:25:24,103 --> 00:25:26,054
What is it?

626
00:25:26,122 --> 00:25:27,606
Have you ever said to Harvey,

627
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:29,051
"this conversation
never happened"?

628
00:25:29,058 --> 00:25:30,992
- Louis.
- Please tell me you never have.

629
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:33,361
Would I tell you if I had?

630
00:25:33,412 --> 00:25:34,412
I'll take that as a no.

631
00:25:34,497 --> 00:25:36,164
Good night, Louis.

632
00:25:36,232 --> 00:25:38,066
Black Swan.

633
00:25:45,908 --> 00:25:48,743
Wednesday, 6:52 p.m.,

634
00:25:48,794 --> 00:25:51,346
it happened.

635
00:26:06,312 --> 00:26:07,595
Wow.

636
00:26:07,647 --> 00:26:09,364
You aren't having
a heart attack, are you?

637
00:26:09,431 --> 00:26:11,766
Would that put a crimp
in your evening?

638
00:26:11,817 --> 00:26:12,984
Well, I guess I could scalp
your ticket,

639
00:26:13,069 --> 00:26:15,287
seeing as it is the hottest
of the season.

640
00:26:15,371 --> 00:26:18,490
You know, I practically had
to sell my spleen for them.

641
00:26:18,574 --> 00:26:20,242
That's funny. I heard
you got them from a client.

642
00:26:20,293 --> 00:26:22,460
Did you also hear
that I traded him my spleen?

643
00:26:22,545 --> 00:26:24,329
I don't care if it cost you
a lung.

644
00:26:24,413 --> 00:26:27,749
Daniel Day-Lewis in a kilt?
Worth it.

645
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:30,451
- I'm really glad to hear that.
- Of course you are.

646
00:26:30,503 --> 00:26:32,837
You found out
how much I love the theater.

647
00:26:32,922 --> 00:26:35,056
You don't think the reason
that I arranged all of this

648
00:26:35,124 --> 00:26:37,458
is because I looked
into you?

649
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:39,294
Didn't you?

650
00:26:39,345 --> 00:26:40,795
Sure I did.

651
00:26:40,846 --> 00:26:42,564
You know,
I'm actually to theater

652
00:26:42,631 --> 00:26:43,815
what Harvey is to sport.

653
00:26:43,899 --> 00:26:45,433
Nah, you don't give a shit
about theater.

654
00:26:45,484 --> 00:26:47,635
You love sports.

655
00:26:47,687 --> 00:26:49,404
- Rugby mostly.
- Nice try.

656
00:26:49,471 --> 00:26:51,106
We do what we can.

657
00:26:51,157 --> 00:26:52,324
But we are going for dinner

658
00:26:52,408 --> 00:26:53,692
with Daniel Day-Lewis
after the show.

659
00:26:53,776 --> 00:26:55,243
You're kidding.

660
00:26:55,311 --> 00:26:56,745
I may be indifferent
to the theater,

661
00:26:56,812 --> 00:26:58,747
but I know
how to get things done.

662
00:26:58,814 --> 00:27:00,198
You are good.

663
00:27:00,283 --> 00:27:02,984
I told you that
on the first day we met.

664
00:27:03,035 --> 00:27:05,987
I'm better than good.

665
00:27:06,038 --> 00:27:08,323
What time is dinner?

666
00:27:08,374 --> 00:27:09,541
10:30.

667
00:27:09,625 --> 00:27:11,259
Then we better get going.

668
00:27:11,327 --> 00:27:13,712
Oh, the show doesn't start
for another 20 minutes.

669
00:27:13,796 --> 00:27:17,665
We aren't going to the show.

670
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:22,687
Taxi!

671
00:27:25,181 --> 00:27:27,181
Is that really necessary?

672
00:27:27,216 --> 00:27:28,516
It will be in the deposition.?

673
00:27:28,584 --> 00:27:29,905
I don't care
about the deposition.

674
00:27:29,918 --> 00:27:31,352
- Harvey--
- You want to know

675
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:33,438
how you come across, you have
to see how you come across.

676
00:27:33,522 --> 00:27:34,806
Now answer my question.

677
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:38,092
Did you bribe
a foreign government?

678
00:27:38,144 --> 00:27:39,737
Why are you hesitating,
Miss Hessington?

679
00:27:39,738 --> 00:27:41,039
Something to hide?
Look, I think what Harvey's

680
00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:42,541
trying to say--
You hesitate,

681
00:27:42,592 --> 00:27:44,292
they won't trust you.

682
00:27:44,377 --> 00:27:45,577
Your bribery
isn't in question.

683
00:27:45,595 --> 00:27:46,845
Cameron is gonna enter that plea
into evidence.

684
00:27:46,912 --> 00:27:48,463
You have to own it
and move on.

685
00:27:48,548 --> 00:27:50,109
And I suggest you do it
more believably,

686
00:27:50,132 --> 00:27:52,434
because when you're up there
staring down the barrel

687
00:27:52,518 --> 00:27:54,436
of 12 executioners,

688
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:56,471
there's no changing your mind.

689
00:27:56,556 --> 00:27:58,189
Do you think I don't know
you're trying to rattle me?

690
00:27:58,257 --> 00:28:00,258
Rattle you?
I'm just giving you the facts.

691
00:28:00,326 --> 00:28:02,811
Cameron's gonna rattle you.

692
00:28:02,895 --> 00:28:04,195
And it's gonna work,

693
00:28:04,263 --> 00:28:06,114
because you and I both know
you did this.

694
00:28:06,198 --> 00:28:08,450
- How dare you!
- How dare I what?

695
00:28:08,534 --> 00:28:09,568
This is your idea.

696
00:28:09,635 --> 00:28:11,202
Then ask me
a goddamn question.

697
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:12,487
You bribed that government.

698
00:28:12,572 --> 00:28:14,406
What's to stop anyone
with a pulse

699
00:28:14,457 --> 00:28:17,208
from believing you knew
that money was payment

700
00:28:17,276 --> 00:28:18,510
for killing those people?

701
00:28:18,578 --> 00:28:20,712
Because life is more important
to me than money.

702
00:28:20,779 --> 00:28:23,281
Then why the hell did you pay
that bribe in the first place?

703
00:28:23,332 --> 00:28:24,852
Because that's how it works
over there.

704
00:28:24,884 --> 00:28:26,751
Murder is also how it works
over there.

705
00:28:26,802 --> 00:28:28,553
You did it.
You know it.

706
00:28:28,621 --> 00:28:31,289
And you're not convincing
anyone.

707
00:28:31,357 --> 00:28:34,059
Very good.

708
00:28:34,126 --> 00:28:37,795
Finally we get to it.

709
00:28:37,847 --> 00:28:39,481
If you check your records,

710
00:28:39,565 --> 00:28:42,484
you'd know the reason we won
that bid is we were

711
00:28:42,568 --> 00:28:44,636
the only company who took it
upon ourselves

712
00:28:44,687 --> 00:28:45,970
to go to the people.

713
00:28:46,022 --> 00:28:48,440
Because you needed to see
what your obstacle was.

714
00:28:48,491 --> 00:28:51,159
My obstacle?

715
00:28:51,243 --> 00:28:54,446
We paid $100 million more
than anyone else

716
00:28:54,497 --> 00:28:58,750
on the condition that the money
be used to relocate any family

717
00:28:58,817 --> 00:29:02,754
who lost anything within
50 miles of that pipeline--

718
00:29:02,821 --> 00:29:07,676
job, home, land, livestock.

719
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,661
Anything.

720
00:29:09,712 --> 00:29:12,597
What happened over there
sickens me.

721
00:29:12,665 --> 00:29:15,934
I lose sleep over it
every night.

722
00:29:16,001 --> 00:29:19,387
And as soon as I am
out of this nightmare,

723
00:29:19,472 --> 00:29:22,190
I am going to shut down
the entire project--

724
00:29:22,274 --> 00:29:27,195
the pipeline, the oil fields,
all of it.

725
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:30,014
So I've had just about enough
of you two wondering

726
00:29:30,066 --> 00:29:32,850
whether I'm guilty
of these murders or not.

727
00:29:32,902 --> 00:29:36,655
Is that a good enough trial run
for you?

728
00:29:45,498 --> 00:29:47,716
Holy shit.

729
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:50,218
She didn't do it.

730
00:29:51,704 --> 00:29:53,638
I understand
you have a strategy

731
00:29:53,706 --> 00:29:55,540
to defeat the takeover attempt.

732
00:29:55,591 --> 00:29:57,559
I do.
But it involves a conversation

733
00:29:57,643 --> 00:29:59,511
about how essential
you find Ava Hessington.

734
00:29:59,562 --> 00:30:01,879
If the only way
to beat Tony Gianopolous

735
00:30:01,931 --> 00:30:03,148
is to get rid of her,

736
00:30:03,215 --> 00:30:04,615
then I don't think
we have a choice.

737
00:30:04,684 --> 00:30:06,818
If you need cover
for the other board members,

738
00:30:06,885 --> 00:30:09,237
then you can just tell them that
Pearson Darby recommended that.

739
00:30:09,321 --> 00:30:11,222
And I'll recommend to them

740
00:30:11,273 --> 00:30:13,241
that we retain
Pearson Darby.

741
00:30:13,325 --> 00:30:15,243
So we have a deal.

742
00:30:25,621 --> 00:30:28,456
What's the matter with you?

743
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:34,713
We just deposed
Ava Hessington.

744
00:30:34,764 --> 00:30:36,097
You deposed
your own client?

745
00:30:36,182 --> 00:30:38,349
Practice.

746
00:30:38,417 --> 00:30:40,018
You couldn't convince her
not to testify?

747
00:30:40,085 --> 00:30:44,439
No, not that.

748
00:30:44,523 --> 00:30:46,608
She convinced us
that maybe she should.

749
00:30:46,692 --> 00:30:51,095
Well, there would be only one
reason to even consider that.

750
00:30:51,147 --> 00:30:53,815
She didn't do it.

751
00:30:53,899 --> 00:30:55,784
- No way.
- I know.

752
00:30:55,868 --> 00:30:57,702
You said, if she's cold enough
to do it,

753
00:30:57,770 --> 00:30:59,937
she'd be cold enough
to lie about it,

754
00:30:59,989 --> 00:31:03,825
but this woman is about to lose
her title, her company,

755
00:31:03,909 --> 00:31:08,046
her whole life...

756
00:31:08,113 --> 00:31:10,465
And I know
that she is telling the truth.

757
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,422
You don't have to believe me.

758
00:31:17,473 --> 00:31:21,009
Take a look for yourself.

759
00:31:25,264 --> 00:31:27,398
- Hey.
- What happened?

760
00:31:27,466 --> 00:31:29,984
- He agreed.
- She's out.

761
00:31:30,069 --> 00:31:32,637
It'll be done tomorrow
before the tender offer vote.

762
00:31:32,688 --> 00:31:34,889
- Then we still have time.
- What are you talking about?

763
00:31:34,907 --> 00:31:37,776
She's innocent.

764
00:31:37,827 --> 00:31:40,078
What?

765
00:31:40,145 --> 00:31:43,364
Take a look at this.

766
00:31:46,919 --> 00:31:48,240
I figured out
what we're gonna do.

767
00:31:48,287 --> 00:31:50,205
And what is that?

768
00:31:50,289 --> 00:31:51,489
What we should have done
in the first place.

769
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:53,591
We're gonna let her talk
to the board.

770
00:31:53,659 --> 00:31:55,543
And preempt tomorrow's meeting
with one of our own.

771
00:31:55,628 --> 00:31:57,178
If she can convince us
she's innocent,

772
00:31:57,263 --> 00:31:58,763
she can convince them
to keep her in charge

773
00:31:58,831 --> 00:32:01,683
and vote against the takeover.
Winwin.

774
00:32:01,767 --> 00:32:03,501
- Have Louis set it up.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Louis?

775
00:32:03,552 --> 00:32:05,220
Yeah.
He'll love it.

776
00:32:05,304 --> 00:32:06,838
Letting her talk
is what he wanted her

777
00:32:06,889 --> 00:32:07,939
to do in the first place.

778
00:32:08,006 --> 00:32:10,007
Get it done.

779
00:32:19,702 --> 00:32:21,853
Louis, what are you
still doing here?

780
00:32:21,904 --> 00:32:23,187
You put in a long day.

781
00:32:23,239 --> 00:32:25,824
You did a great job.
Now go home.

782
00:32:25,875 --> 00:32:27,024
I can't.

783
00:32:27,076 --> 00:32:29,026
Why not?

784
00:32:29,078 --> 00:32:30,745
She didn't do it.

785
00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:34,883
Who didn't do what?

786
00:32:34,967 --> 00:32:38,636
Ava Hessington had nothing
to do with those murders.

787
00:32:38,704 --> 00:32:44,142
How do you like that?

788
00:32:44,209 --> 00:32:45,290
I'll see you
in the morning.

789
00:32:45,344 --> 00:32:47,979
Jessica.

790
00:32:48,046 --> 00:32:51,733
I'm serious.
She's innocent.

791
00:32:51,817 --> 00:32:53,601
And what does that have to do
with me going home tonight?

792
00:32:53,686 --> 00:32:56,237
It has everything
to do with it.

793
00:32:56,322 --> 00:32:57,906
Harvey agreed to let her
talk to the board.

794
00:32:57,990 --> 00:32:59,223
That's all I ever wanted.

795
00:32:59,275 --> 00:33:01,392
Louis, if they don't oust her
tomorrow morning,

796
00:33:01,443 --> 00:33:04,829
they will lose that takeover
vote tomorrow afternoon.

797
00:33:04,897 --> 00:33:06,581
She will be pushed out
either way.

798
00:33:06,665 --> 00:33:07,866
Well, at least
I won't be responsible

799
00:33:07,917 --> 00:33:09,868
for taking away
an innocent woman's company.

800
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:11,502
You're not responsible for it.

801
00:33:11,570 --> 00:33:14,038
This is a hostile takeover.

802
00:33:14,089 --> 00:33:16,674
They're coming tomorrow,
and the market doesn't care

803
00:33:16,742 --> 00:33:18,009
whether she's innocent or not.

804
00:33:18,076 --> 00:33:19,127
Harvey's gonna think
it was me.

805
00:33:19,211 --> 00:33:20,578
It was you.

806
00:33:20,629 --> 00:33:22,597
And he would have thought that
before.

807
00:33:22,681 --> 00:33:25,750
Please do not stop me

808
00:33:25,801 --> 00:33:27,518
from going back to that board.

809
00:33:27,586 --> 00:33:29,854
Louis, you offered
to do this.

810
00:33:29,922 --> 00:33:31,439
You're not doing this to Harvey.

811
00:33:31,523 --> 00:33:33,358
You're doing this
for your client,

812
00:33:33,425 --> 00:33:34,692
Hessington Oil.

813
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:36,761
Ava Hessington
is Hessington Oil.

814
00:33:36,812 --> 00:33:38,429
- Not anymore.
- Jessica.

815
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,531
Enough.

816
00:33:40,599 --> 00:33:42,266
This conversation did happen,

817
00:33:42,318 --> 00:33:44,769
and it's over.

818
00:33:57,539 --> 00:33:59,442
How long have
you been standing there?

819
00:33:59,908 --> 00:34:01,775
Long enough to know
that if this law thing

820
00:34:01,776 --> 00:34:05,362
doesn't work out, you'd make
a lousy boy Friday.

821
00:34:05,446 --> 00:34:07,831
I'd ask you to help, but I
wouldn't want to take advantage.

822
00:34:07,915 --> 00:34:11,501
And I'd say yes, but I don't
want to be taken advantage of.

823
00:34:11,585 --> 00:34:13,253
Though I am happy to watch.

824
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,655
I'm nothing but a piece
of meat to you, aren't I?

825
00:34:15,706 --> 00:34:18,541
Quiet, copy boy.

826
00:34:18,626 --> 00:34:21,711
Same time tomorrow night?

827
00:34:21,796 --> 00:34:24,381
Absolutely.

828
00:34:29,770 --> 00:34:31,888
Interesting.

829
00:34:33,891 --> 00:34:35,675
If you find copy rooms
interesting,

830
00:34:35,726 --> 00:34:37,277
you need to get out more.

831
00:34:37,344 --> 00:34:39,229
Oh, I'm not talking
about the copy room.

832
00:34:39,313 --> 00:34:40,680
I'm talking about you
and Stephen

833
00:34:40,731 --> 00:34:41,891
and the spring in your steps.

834
00:34:41,949 --> 00:34:43,349
If I didn't know any better,
I'd say

835
00:34:43,350 --> 00:34:44,534
you were sleeping with him.

836
00:34:44,618 --> 00:34:47,370
Oh, my God,
you slept with him, didn't you?

837
00:34:47,455 --> 00:34:49,188
No.

838
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:50,373
How was it?

839
00:34:50,458 --> 00:34:54,244
Suffice it to say,
I was awesome.

840
00:34:54,328 --> 00:34:55,628
Oh, wait, sorry,
you probably wanted to know

841
00:34:55,696 --> 00:34:56,663
about him, didn't you?
That was the point

842
00:34:56,714 --> 00:34:58,048
of the question, yes.
Eh.

843
00:34:58,132 --> 00:34:59,549
- Really?
- God, no.

844
00:34:59,633 --> 00:35:01,384
I may have met my match.
Oh, my God.

845
00:35:01,469 --> 00:35:02,635
And the arrangement?
Ongoing.

846
00:35:02,703 --> 00:35:04,537
- Well, did you tell Harvey?
- Oh, my God.

847
00:35:04,605 --> 00:35:07,540
- What?
- I never thought about Harvey.

848
00:35:07,591 --> 00:35:08,842
I'm Donna. How could I
have not thought of that?

849
00:35:08,893 --> 00:35:10,427
Because you weren't thinking
with your brain.

850
00:35:10,511 --> 00:35:12,095
- Good one.
- You were thinking with your--

851
00:35:12,179 --> 00:35:15,882
- Yeah, I got it.
- So what are you gonna do?

852
00:35:15,933 --> 00:35:18,718
I'm gonna tell him
as soon as he gets back.

853
00:35:26,494 --> 00:35:27,577
- Have everything we need?
- Everything.

854
00:35:27,661 --> 00:35:28,912
Where's Louis?

855
00:35:28,996 --> 00:35:30,196
He's gonna meet us over there.

856
00:35:30,197 --> 00:35:31,915
We should all be going
together.

857
00:35:31,999 --> 00:35:34,334
Well, at least Ava's here
on time.

858
00:35:34,401 --> 00:35:37,954
- What the hell did you do?
- What are you talking about?

859
00:35:38,038 --> 00:35:40,239
I just got voted out
of my own company.

860
00:35:40,291 --> 00:35:41,491
Wait, the vote on the takeover

861
00:35:41,542 --> 00:35:42,842
isn't supposed to be
till this afternoon.

862
00:35:42,910 --> 00:35:44,844
Well, they had a different one
before that,

863
00:35:44,912 --> 00:35:46,078
and I'm out.

864
00:35:46,130 --> 00:35:48,014
And what I want to know is,
did you know?

865
00:35:48,081 --> 00:35:50,016
Ava, I didn't go
behind your back.

866
00:35:50,083 --> 00:35:51,935
Well, you may not have gone
behind my back,

867
00:35:52,019 --> 00:35:53,269
but this never would have
happened if you'd let me

868
00:35:53,354 --> 00:35:55,271
speak publicly
in the first place.

869
00:35:55,356 --> 00:35:58,725
Look, Ava, my believing
in your innocence

870
00:35:58,776 --> 00:36:00,894
wouldn't change my mind
about you talking to a reporter.

871
00:36:00,945 --> 00:36:02,445
Then why were you going
to let me speak today?

872
00:36:02,530 --> 00:36:04,263
Because an interview
isn't the same thing

873
00:36:04,315 --> 00:36:06,533
as a closed-door meeting
within your own company.

874
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:07,867
Well, they had
a closed-door meeting,

875
00:36:07,935 --> 00:36:10,286
and the only person
who benefited from that was you.

876
00:36:10,371 --> 00:36:11,404
How's that?

877
00:36:11,455 --> 00:36:13,940
I may be out,
but you're not.

878
00:36:13,991 --> 00:36:17,443
Pearson Darby has been
conveniently retained

879
00:36:17,495 --> 00:36:21,631
as Hessington Oil's
legal counsel.

880
00:36:21,715 --> 00:36:23,750
You think I don't know
this was you?

881
00:36:23,801 --> 00:36:25,785
I don't care whether you know
it was me or not.

882
00:36:25,836 --> 00:36:28,054
I stand by what I did,
and I'd do it again.

883
00:36:28,121 --> 00:36:29,172
You mean selling Ava out

884
00:36:29,256 --> 00:36:30,507
because of your personal issues
with me?

885
00:36:30,591 --> 00:36:33,176
This isn't personal,
and it's not about you.

886
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:35,461
Bullshit.
Ever since Darby handed me

887
00:36:35,513 --> 00:36:37,480
this case and not you,
you've been pissed.

888
00:36:37,565 --> 00:36:40,466
I wasn't pissed until we had
a disagreement on strategy,

889
00:36:40,518 --> 00:36:42,735
and you invoked his name
to cut me out.

890
00:36:42,803 --> 00:36:44,354
I get it.

891
00:36:44,438 --> 00:36:46,189
I wasn't wrong
about it being personal.

892
00:36:46,273 --> 00:36:47,690
I was wrong
about which person.

893
00:36:47,775 --> 00:36:49,025
You're not pissed at me.

894
00:36:49,109 --> 00:36:51,244
You're pissed at yourself
for getting played.

895
00:36:51,311 --> 00:36:53,112
What did you just say to me?

896
00:36:53,164 --> 00:36:54,197
You heard me.

897
00:36:54,281 --> 00:36:55,698
Fools rush in,

898
00:36:55,783 --> 00:36:57,367
and you're the one
who gave him the 51%

899
00:36:57,451 --> 00:37:00,954
in the first place.

900
00:37:01,005 --> 00:37:04,207
I merged with Edward
for the sake of this firm,

901
00:37:04,291 --> 00:37:06,593
just like what I did today
with Ava.

902
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:10,180
And the only one in this room
taking things personally is you.

903
00:37:10,264 --> 00:37:11,831
Tell yourself
whatever you want,

904
00:37:11,882 --> 00:37:13,499
but don't tell me it doesn't
have to do with Darby

905
00:37:13,567 --> 00:37:15,718
and don't tell me
it isn't personal,

906
00:37:15,803 --> 00:37:18,721
because you can't stand
being number two.

907
00:37:23,277 --> 00:37:24,694
- Harvey, do you have a minute?
- No, I don't.

908
00:37:24,778 --> 00:37:27,347
I need Edward Darby
on the phone right now.

909
00:37:27,414 --> 00:37:28,975
By the way,
where were you this morning?

910
00:37:29,016 --> 00:37:29,949
What are you talking about?
I was here.

911
00:37:30,017 --> 00:37:31,183
You weren't here.

912
00:37:31,235 --> 00:37:32,852
I was in the copy room.

913
00:37:32,903 --> 00:37:35,021
Well, what the hell were you
doing in the copy room?

914
00:37:35,072 --> 00:37:38,074
I was finishing up
a couple things for Stephen.

915
00:37:38,158 --> 00:37:39,742
You're working for Stephen?

916
00:37:39,827 --> 00:37:42,795
- I made some copies.
- You work for me.

917
00:37:42,863 --> 00:37:45,531
Sorry.

918
00:37:45,583 --> 00:37:47,667
It was a one-time thing.
Well, since you haven't gotten

919
00:37:47,718 --> 00:37:49,636
Darby for me yet,
what do you want?

920
00:37:49,703 --> 00:37:52,805
Nothing.
It can wait.

921
00:38:09,156 --> 00:38:11,658
What do you want?

922
00:38:11,725 --> 00:38:14,694
I want to tell you
that I enjoyed working with you.

923
00:38:14,745 --> 00:38:18,448
I thought I was gonna be able
to say the same.

924
00:38:18,532 --> 00:38:20,750
If it means anything to you,
I told Louis

925
00:38:20,834 --> 00:38:22,285
to stop the plan
to get rid of Ava.

926
00:38:22,369 --> 00:38:24,621
Did you know
he wasn't going to?

927
00:38:24,705 --> 00:38:26,372
No.

928
00:38:26,423 --> 00:38:29,075
But the truth is,
even if I did,

929
00:38:29,126 --> 00:38:31,261
I wouldn't have done anything
to stop it.

930
00:38:31,345 --> 00:38:33,880
Is that supposed
to make me believe you?

931
00:38:33,931 --> 00:38:37,183
It's supposed to make you
understand me.

932
00:38:40,354 --> 00:38:42,138
You're loyal to him.

933
00:38:42,222 --> 00:38:45,525
I'm committed to him.

934
00:38:45,592 --> 00:38:48,061
Good night, Katrina.

935
00:38:48,112 --> 00:38:51,781
Good night.

936
00:39:01,608 --> 00:39:03,409
What did she want?

937
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:05,795
Nothing.

938
00:39:05,879 --> 00:39:07,997
Tell me
she enjoyed working with me.

939
00:39:08,082 --> 00:39:11,801
- Did you?
- Did I what?

940
00:39:11,885 --> 00:39:13,469
Did you enjoy
working with her?

941
00:39:13,554 --> 00:39:17,674
I mean, I just kept seeing
you guys working together

942
00:39:17,758 --> 00:39:20,560
all the time, and you just
seemed to be bonding away.

943
00:39:20,627 --> 00:39:22,729
- Are you jealous?
- It's not funny.

944
00:39:22,796 --> 00:39:25,348
I'm not smiling
because it's funny.

945
00:39:25,432 --> 00:39:27,233
I'm smiling
because it's sweet.

946
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:28,801
You didn't think it was sweet
when I was jealous

947
00:39:28,852 --> 00:39:29,902
of you and Jenny.

948
00:39:29,970 --> 00:39:31,571
You and I
weren't together then,

949
00:39:31,638 --> 00:39:34,741
but we are now.
Right.

950
00:39:34,808 --> 00:39:37,493
Which is why
it bothers me more now.

951
00:39:37,578 --> 00:39:40,446
Rachel...

952
00:39:40,497 --> 00:39:42,815
I trusted you
with my secret,

953
00:39:42,883 --> 00:39:45,034
my life.

954
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:46,619
If I trusted you with that,
don't you know that

955
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:50,656
that means I...

956
00:39:51,559 --> 00:39:53,693
That I...

957
00:39:56,263 --> 00:39:57,663
What are you--
what are you trying to say?

958
00:39:57,715 --> 00:39:59,265
You know
what I'm trying to say.

959
00:39:59,332 --> 00:40:02,385
Don't say it now.
I don't want to hear it here.

960
00:40:02,469 --> 00:40:04,687
Here? Where we've done
pretty much everything else?

961
00:40:04,772 --> 00:40:08,358
- Mike, I--
- I love you.

962
00:40:08,442 --> 00:40:10,526
I love you.

963
00:40:10,611 --> 00:40:12,695
I don't want
to keep it in anymore.

964
00:40:17,234 --> 00:40:18,818
I love you too.

965
00:40:18,869 --> 00:40:21,871
And in this moment
I don't care who knows.

966
00:40:47,064 --> 00:40:48,147
What you did amounts

967
00:40:48,215 --> 00:40:50,099
to nothing short
of insubordination.

968
00:40:50,184 --> 00:40:51,184
Did you fly all the way

969
00:40:51,235 --> 00:40:52,384
from another country
to tell me that?

970
00:40:52,436 --> 00:40:53,553
You could have just called.

971
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:55,221
I gave you
a very clear directive,

972
00:40:55,272 --> 00:40:56,239
and you defied me.

973
00:40:56,323 --> 00:40:57,240
Do you want to get into it?

974
00:40:57,324 --> 00:40:58,291
I most certainly do.

975
00:40:58,358 --> 00:40:59,692
When I agreed to merge
with you,

976
00:40:59,743 --> 00:41:01,244
I knew it was 51-49,

977
00:41:01,328 --> 00:41:03,229
but I didn't think
you would lord your 2%

978
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:05,198
over me like a hammer.

979
00:41:05,249 --> 00:41:07,667
And when I agreed
to acquire you,

980
00:41:07,734 --> 00:41:08,785
I didn't think
I'd have to.

981
00:41:08,869 --> 00:41:10,169
Are you saying
you regret this merger?

982
00:41:10,237 --> 00:41:11,788
I'm saying perhaps I
should have paid more attention

983
00:41:11,872 --> 00:41:13,089
to the red flags,

984
00:41:13,173 --> 00:41:14,457
such as covering up
the embezzlement

985
00:41:14,541 --> 00:41:15,958
of a former partner.

986
00:41:16,043 --> 00:41:17,960
Something you were more than
willing to use to make the deal.

987
00:41:18,045 --> 00:41:20,012
You went behind my back.

988
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:21,597
And you stuck me
with this case

989
00:41:21,682 --> 00:41:24,600
and then risked losing me
a huge amount of money.

990
00:41:24,685 --> 00:41:27,386
I gave Harvey this case
after already handing you

991
00:41:27,438 --> 00:41:28,638
a huge amount of money.

992
00:41:28,722 --> 00:41:32,141
I am in charge
on this side of the ocean.

993
00:41:32,226 --> 00:41:33,810
Because I allow it
to be that way.

994
00:41:33,894 --> 00:41:35,111
And there it is again.

995
00:41:35,195 --> 00:41:37,864
51-49.

996
00:41:37,931 --> 00:41:41,100
Until now I believed
that Harvey was the wild horse

997
00:41:41,151 --> 00:41:43,286
that couldn't be tamed,
but perhaps it is you.

998
00:41:43,370 --> 00:41:45,271
I think maybe Harvey was right.

999
00:41:45,322 --> 00:41:46,823
It is personal.

1000
00:41:46,907 --> 00:41:48,107
But I didn't make it that way.

1001
00:41:48,108 --> 00:41:50,293
You did when you allowed
your feelings

1002
00:41:50,377 --> 00:41:52,628
for Ava
to cloud your judgment.

1003
00:41:52,713 --> 00:41:55,414
And as you pointed out,
I had a partner once

1004
00:41:55,466 --> 00:41:58,117
who made decisions
based on his personal shit,

1005
00:41:58,168 --> 00:42:00,470
and I will not allow that
to happen again.

1006
00:42:00,554 --> 00:42:02,588
And 51-49 or not,

1007
00:42:02,639 --> 00:42:05,842
I just took 14 million and put
it on my side of the ledger,

1008
00:42:05,926 --> 00:42:07,727
so do me a favor, Edward,
and turn off the lights

1009
00:42:07,794 --> 00:42:09,846
on your way out.
