00:00:01,436 --> 00:00:03,028
I get Ava Hessington acquitted,

2
00:00:03,437 --> 00:00:05,105
Darby backs me
for managing partner.

3
00:00:05,189 --> 00:00:07,774
I don't want it anymore.
Get out of my sight.

4
00:00:07,858 --> 00:00:09,559
You called Mariga
to offer him a bribe.

5
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:10,744
Doesn't matter--
Danny should never have

6
00:00:10,828 --> 00:00:11,828
had him in the first place.

7
00:00:11,895 --> 00:00:12,862
But he does now.

8
00:00:12,914 --> 00:00:15,081
You're saying
he traced my call.

9
00:00:15,166 --> 00:00:18,084
You're suing me for ownership
of the Mikado?

10
00:00:18,169 --> 00:00:20,236
He said he might as well
have left his cat

11
00:00:20,288 --> 00:00:22,339
with Michael Vick.

12
00:00:22,406 --> 00:00:23,873
I'm offering you
a settlement.

13
00:00:23,925 --> 00:00:27,177
He get back the associates,
I get back my cat.

14
00:00:27,244 --> 00:00:28,878
Clifford Danner is 18.

15
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:31,681
I put him in jail 12 years ago.
He's innocent.

16
00:00:31,749 --> 00:00:32,915
Cameron buried the evidence.

17
00:00:32,967 --> 00:00:34,768
Emmanuel Mariga,
20 years ago

18
00:00:34,852 --> 00:00:37,220
at the University of Cape Town
on the rugby team.

19
00:00:37,271 --> 00:00:39,189
You know who else played rugby?
Stephen Huntley.

20
00:00:39,256 --> 00:00:41,024
Stephen was the one
who ordered those killings.

21
00:00:41,091 --> 00:00:42,776
I'm so sorry, Harvey.

22
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,697
Aah!

23
00:00:54,438 --> 00:00:56,406
[Winces]

24
00:00:56,457 --> 00:00:58,875
Tell me he looks worse.

25
00:00:58,942 --> 00:01:01,995
He does.

26
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:04,297
Are you hurt?

27
00:01:04,382 --> 00:01:06,166
No, I'm fine.

28
00:01:08,619 --> 00:01:10,387
I hope you didn't do that
because of me.

29
00:01:10,454 --> 00:01:13,556
It was a fight, Donna,
not a duel.

30
00:01:15,259 --> 00:01:18,928
- How could I not have--
- Listen to me.

31
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:21,798
Stephen betrayed us all.

32
00:01:21,849 --> 00:01:23,433
You don't understand,
Harvey.

33
00:01:23,484 --> 00:01:26,636
I was with him.

34
00:01:26,687 --> 00:01:28,772
And he was capable
of something like that,

35
00:01:28,823 --> 00:01:30,190
and I didn't even see it.

36
00:01:30,274 --> 00:01:32,609
You know, I'm supposed to--
Donna!

37
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:34,577
[Sighs]

38
00:01:34,645 --> 00:01:36,312
It's okay.

39
00:01:36,364 --> 00:01:38,865
Just tell me
you're gonna make him pay.

40
00:01:38,949 --> 00:01:42,202
He'll pay.

41
00:01:50,628 --> 00:01:53,463
Let's not talk about it.

42
00:01:53,514 --> 00:01:56,516
Talk about what?

43
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,301
What do you need me to do?

44
00:01:58,352 --> 00:01:59,969
I need you to keep going
with everything you have

45
00:02:00,021 --> 00:02:01,504
to impeach
Mariga's testimony.

46
00:02:01,555 --> 00:02:02,689
What about the stuff
on Stephen?

47
00:02:02,773 --> 00:02:04,507
- Not yet.
- Why not?

48
00:02:04,558 --> 00:02:05,892
Because we don't have proof.

49
00:02:05,976 --> 00:02:07,027
The trial's in two days.

50
00:02:07,111 --> 00:02:08,228
We should bring Ava in
and tell her--

51
00:02:08,312 --> 00:02:09,229
- Not yet.
- Why not?

52
00:02:09,313 --> 00:02:10,280
Because we don't have proof.

53
00:02:10,347 --> 00:02:11,587
Harvey, we have
to do something.

54
00:02:11,649 --> 00:02:13,010
And how would
that conversation go?

55
00:02:13,016 --> 00:02:15,118
"Hi, Ava, turns out
one of the lawyers from our firm

56
00:02:15,185 --> 00:02:16,953
"is trying to frame you
for a crime he committed.

57
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:19,355
But right now we're not sure
we can do anything about it."

58
00:02:19,407 --> 00:02:20,957
What are you gonna do?

59
00:02:21,024 --> 00:02:22,525
I'm gonna go home,
get a good night's sleep,

60
00:02:22,576 --> 00:02:23,743
and then tomorrow
I'm gonna find out

61
00:02:23,828 --> 00:02:24,911
what the whole story is.

62
00:02:24,995 --> 00:02:26,395
Harvey, Stephen
isn't gonna tell you

63
00:02:26,414 --> 00:02:27,714
what the whole story is.

64
00:02:27,798 --> 00:02:30,199
No, but there's
someone else who can.

65
00:02:32,336 --> 00:02:34,203
You knew this case
was heading your way

66
00:02:34,255 --> 00:02:35,588
before you ever
came after us.

67
00:02:35,673 --> 00:02:37,173
That's why
you wanted to merge.

68
00:02:37,224 --> 00:02:38,425
Yes, it is.

69
00:02:38,509 --> 00:02:40,269
And I regret the situation
as much as you do.

70
00:02:40,311 --> 00:02:41,728
But what's done is done.

71
00:02:41,812 --> 00:02:43,813
Is that what you told Stephen
when you found out he did it?

72
00:02:43,881 --> 00:02:44,981
Found out?

73
00:02:45,048 --> 00:02:46,599
How do we know
he didn't order it?

74
00:02:46,684 --> 00:02:48,384
Because I am giving you
my word.

75
00:02:48,436 --> 00:02:50,570
Why should we trust a man
who sent Stephen over here

76
00:02:50,654 --> 00:02:52,072
to cover his ass?

77
00:02:52,156 --> 00:02:55,525
I sent Stephen over here
because I care about Ava,

78
00:02:55,576 --> 00:02:58,227
which is why I sent him to
the E.I.R. in the first place.

79
00:02:58,279 --> 00:03:00,580
I had no idea
he would do what he did,

80
00:03:00,664 --> 00:03:02,799
and I have been trying
to fix it ever since.

81
00:03:02,867 --> 00:03:05,168
- Then fix it right now.
- And how exactly can I do that?

82
00:03:05,236 --> 00:03:06,803
By stating in court

83
00:03:06,871 --> 00:03:09,205
Stephen acted alone
without Ava's knowledge.

84
00:03:09,273 --> 00:03:10,840
- I can't.
- Why not?

85
00:03:10,908 --> 00:03:12,292
Because he never told me.

86
00:03:12,376 --> 00:03:15,345
And you never asked because
you never wanted to know.

87
00:03:15,412 --> 00:03:17,180
You piece of shit.

88
00:03:17,247 --> 00:03:19,099
You care about Ava
so much.

89
00:03:19,183 --> 00:03:21,083
How could you
do this to her?

90
00:03:21,135 --> 00:03:23,303
I wasn't doing anything
to her.

91
00:03:23,387 --> 00:03:25,755
I was trying to do
something for her.

92
00:03:25,806 --> 00:03:29,125
Remind me never to ask you
for any favors.

93
00:03:29,193 --> 00:03:31,027
Well, I'm not asking
for a favor.

94
00:03:31,094 --> 00:03:33,446
But you are going to agree
to do something right now.

95
00:03:33,531 --> 00:03:36,316
And what is that?

00:03:52,282 --> 00:03:54,050
Well, you have it.

102
00:03:54,117 --> 00:03:57,003
Good, 'cause I just have
one question for you.

103
00:03:57,087 --> 00:03:58,922
How can you live
with yourself?

104
00:03:58,973 --> 00:04:00,757
- What?
- You know what?

105
00:04:00,808 --> 00:04:02,175
I don't have any questions
for you.

106
00:04:02,259 --> 00:04:04,293
I just came in here to let
you know that you make me sick.

107
00:04:04,345 --> 00:04:06,896
Obviously
I hurt you, Donna,

108
00:04:06,964 --> 00:04:08,982
and I never meant
to do that.

109
00:04:09,066 --> 00:04:10,400
Oh, you didn't hurt me.

110
00:04:10,467 --> 00:04:12,569
You just made me somebody
who slept with a murderer.

111

Murderer?

112

I don't know
what you think you know,

113
00:04:17,441 --> 00:04:20,493
but those people that
were killed were terrorists.

114
00:04:20,578 --> 00:04:21,744
They were people...

115
00:04:21,812 --> 00:04:23,479
Who lived on top
of something that you wanted.

116
00:04:23,531 --> 00:04:26,332
People who had guns--
murderers, Donna.

by how business is done,

all of your designer clothes

120

this firm does.

122

You mean chemical companies
that Harvey represents

or car companies
that Harvey defends?

125
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:47,020

whose claims he helps deny?

They sat there in judgment while
my character got ripped apart,

lifted a single finger to help.

Wait a second.

179
00:07:03,109 --> 00:07:04,777
That deal is only good
if he's telling the truth.

180
00:07:04,844 --> 00:07:06,812
We can't go after him
with the truth on the stand.

181
00:07:06,863 --> 00:07:10,015
Maybe, but we can go after him
with the truth not on the stand.

Cameron would have
to be willing to listen.

Then I better
get him to listen.

184
00:07:13,486 --> 00:07:14,787
And I better
go after Mariga.

about your stupid trial,

really went down.

proves nothing.

I'm going to do.

my testimony,

that is not
going to happen.

256
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:18,887
It doesn't need
to happen,

257
00:10:18,972 --> 00:10:21,757
'cause once we prove
that you're lying about Ava,

258
00:10:21,841 --> 00:10:23,425
Cameron Dennis is going
to cancel your deal,

259
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:25,811
and you're gonna come to me
begging for help.

260
00:10:28,815 --> 00:10:30,766
Do you think
you're the scariest man

261
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:32,101
I've ever sat across from?

262
00:10:32,185 --> 00:10:34,736
I know
you're not scared of me.

263
00:10:34,821 --> 00:10:37,573
But you are scared
of your own people,

264
00:10:37,657 --> 00:10:39,324
and you should be,

265
00:10:39,392 --> 00:10:40,576
because you and I
both know

266
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:43,395
they're gonna kill you
the minute you get back.

267
00:10:43,446 --> 00:10:46,064
That I know Stephen doesn't
mean I'm lying about Ava.

268
00:10:46,116 --> 00:10:47,199
But you are.

269
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:49,334
Ah, and you can see
into my soul.

270
00:10:49,402 --> 00:10:51,336
It doesn't take a fortune
teller to know you're lying.

271
00:10:51,404 --> 00:10:53,905
And it doesn't take one
to know that if you had proof,

272
00:10:53,957 --> 00:10:55,841
you wouldn't be here
talking to me.

273
00:10:58,344 --> 00:11:00,579
So you're not protecting
Stephen out of principle.

274
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:02,598
I'm not a man
of principle.

275
00:11:02,682 --> 00:11:05,350
I'm a man of expediency.
I get it.

276
00:11:05,418 --> 00:11:07,886
If you change your tune now,
you'll lose the deal you have.

277
00:11:07,937 --> 00:11:12,107

how do you say it--

I don't need your help.

283

00:11:28,491 --> 00:11:29,908
You're wrong.

285
00:11:29,959 --> 00:11:32,044
I can help you do what you
always said you're all about--

286

putting bad guys away.

287
00:11:33,613 --> 00:11:35,414
You got a confession for me?

288
00:11:35,465 --> 00:11:37,332
You're going
after the wrong person.

289
00:11:37,417 --> 00:11:39,301
You're her lawyer.
That's what you would say.

290
00:11:39,385 --> 00:11:41,336
I'm not here as her lawyer.

291
00:11:41,421 --> 00:11:42,804
This isn't a speech
for a jury.

292
00:11:42,889 --> 00:11:45,057
I'm here man-to-man to talk
to the guy I used to know.

293
00:11:45,124 --> 00:11:47,176
All right.

294
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:48,727
Talk.

295
00:11:48,794 --> 00:11:51,847
- I know who really did this.
- Then tell me who it is.

300
00:11:58,605 --> 00:12:00,138
you are sadly mistaken.

but somebody else can.

He says Ava Hessington
pulled his trigger,

307
00:12:12,202 --> 00:12:13,985
and you want me to have him
change his story?

308
00:12:14,037 --> 00:12:15,153
He's only pointing at Ava

309
00:12:15,205 --> 00:12:16,488
because that's what
you want to hear.

310
00:12:16,539 --> 00:12:18,323
Change his deal,
he'll tell you the truth.

311
00:12:18,374 --> 00:12:20,759
He changes his story now,

312
00:12:20,826 --> 00:12:22,961
anything he says
about anybody means shit.

313
00:12:23,012 --> 00:12:24,546
It means shit in court,
but if you are

314
00:12:24,631 --> 00:12:27,883
who you say you are,
it should mean something to you.

315
00:12:27,967 --> 00:12:29,384
You know what, Harvey?

316
00:12:29,469 --> 00:12:32,104
I believe that you believe
she's innocent,

317
00:12:32,171 --> 00:12:33,532
and if you can convince me
of that,

318
00:12:33,606 --> 00:12:35,557
I won't go after her,
but I'm not gonna guarantee

319
00:12:35,642 --> 00:12:37,693
I won't use what you say
before I hear it.

320
00:12:37,777 --> 00:12:40,512
- You want me to just trust you?
- That's what you're asking me.

321
00:12:40,563 --> 00:12:43,398
But if you think that I'm gonna
kneecap my star witness

322
00:12:43,483 --> 00:12:46,652
the day before the trial,
you are out of your mind.

324
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:53,063
What's up, man?
it's good to see you.

325
00:12:53,148 --> 00:12:54,548
I thought
you were my friend.

326
00:12:54,616 --> 00:12:56,116
I am.
What the hell?

327
00:12:56,184 --> 00:12:58,018
Friends don't say they tried
to save your job

328
00:12:58,069 --> 00:13:00,520
when, really,
they hung you out to dry.

329
00:13:00,572 --> 00:13:01,855
So it's true.

330
00:13:01,907 --> 00:13:03,374
Look, Harold,
I didn't mean to--

331
00:13:03,458 --> 00:13:05,209
You know what? Save whatever
bullshit explanation you have,

332
00:13:05,293 --> 00:13:06,544
because I don't want
to hear it.

333
00:13:06,628 --> 00:13:08,462
I'm not trying to give you
a bullshit explanation.

334
00:13:08,529 --> 00:13:09,630
Because there is none.

335
00:13:09,697 --> 00:13:11,215
You got to choose
between you and me,

336
00:13:11,299 --> 00:13:12,532
and you chose yourself.

337
00:13:13,032 --> 00:13:14,482
And then you lied to me
about it.

338
00:13:14,533 --> 00:13:15,533
Yes, Harold, I did.

339
00:13:15,618 --> 00:13:16,778
And then after I lied to you,

340
00:13:16,786 --> 00:13:19,671
I got you a job
at a huge, powerful firm.

341
00:13:19,755 --> 00:13:21,256
Yeah, you got me that job
so I'd owe you one

342
00:13:21,323 --> 00:13:22,257
when the time came.

343
00:13:22,324 --> 00:13:23,491
I got you that job

344
00:13:23,542 --> 00:13:25,159
because I thought you deserved
a second chance.

345
00:13:25,211 --> 00:13:27,679
And then you came calling
when you needed a lawsuit filed

346
00:13:27,763 --> 00:13:29,664
to get rid of your witnesses
in your murder trial.

347
00:13:29,715 --> 00:13:31,132
I trusted you
with that lawsuit

348
00:13:31,183 --> 00:13:32,550
because I thought
you were a competent attorney.

349
00:13:32,635 --> 00:13:34,886
And you were more than happy
to take it.

350
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:37,555
And that murder trial you just
mentioned is about to start.

351
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,891
So you can choose to be
pissed off with me or move on.

352
00:13:39,975 --> 00:13:42,610
But right now
I have a job to do.

353
00:13:48,451 --> 00:13:50,201
- Rachel.
- Louis, what did you do?

354
00:13:50,286 --> 00:13:51,703
What do you mean?
What is this?

355
00:13:51,787 --> 00:13:53,905
Fairfield Computers
is being sued.

356
00:13:53,989 --> 00:13:55,790
- How's that my fault?
- Because they're your client,

357
00:13:55,858 --> 00:13:57,459
and the attorney of record
is Harold Gunderson.

358
00:13:57,526 --> 00:14:00,128
He also sent
a settlement offer.

359
00:14:00,195 --> 00:14:02,881
He wants to pick
a fight with me.

360
00:14:02,965 --> 00:14:04,365
He's gonna regret
the day he was born.

361
00:14:04,417 --> 00:14:05,917
Aren't you the one
who picked a fight with him?

362
00:14:06,001 --> 00:14:07,886
Rachel, whose side
are you on?

363
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:09,220
Don't answer that question.

364
00:14:12,758 --> 00:14:14,392
You shouldn't be here.

365
00:14:14,477 --> 00:14:17,896
Stephen said that we're
no different than he is.

366
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:19,931
I need to see you show him
that he's wrong.

367
00:14:20,015 --> 00:14:22,150
This isn't his trial.
It's Ava's.

368
00:14:22,217 --> 00:14:23,718
You're not gonna put him
on the stand?

369
00:14:23,769 --> 00:14:25,570
You said you were gonna
make him pay.

370
00:14:25,654 --> 00:14:28,156
Donna, I will,
but now is not the time.

371
00:14:28,223 --> 00:14:30,391
Then when?
Because he killed people,

372
00:14:30,443 --> 00:14:33,161
and if we let him
get away with it...

373
00:14:33,228 --> 00:14:35,447
Then maybe we are
no different than he is.

374
00:14:37,032 --> 00:14:39,501
Had these insurgents
had their way,

375
00:14:39,568 --> 00:14:41,252
they would have blown up
the pipeline.

376
00:14:41,337 --> 00:14:44,172
Instead, Ms. Hessington
retained a valuable asset,

377
00:14:44,239 --> 00:14:47,258
and I, in turn, was compensated
for a job well done.

378
00:14:47,343 --> 00:14:51,129
And this compensation came
directly from Ava Hessington?

379
00:14:51,213 --> 00:14:52,597
Yes.

380
00:14:52,681 --> 00:14:54,883
She specifically directed you
to kill people?

381
00:14:56,102 --> 00:14:57,302
Yes.

382
00:14:57,386 --> 00:14:59,253
One more thing,
Colonel Mariga--

383
00:14:59,305 --> 00:15:01,439
do you and I have a deal
for you to testify

384
00:15:01,524 --> 00:15:04,109
in exchange
for a more lenient sentence?

385
00:15:04,193 --> 00:15:06,093
Yes.

386
00:15:06,145 --> 00:15:07,428
And why should
the jury believe

387
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,764
that you aren't making this up
to save yourself?

388
00:15:09,815 --> 00:15:12,200
Because if what I say to you
proves to be a lie,

389
00:15:12,267 --> 00:15:14,435
you'll send me back home,

390
00:15:14,487 --> 00:15:17,122
where I will be dead
within minutes.

391
00:15:17,206 --> 00:15:18,456
No further questions.

392
00:15:22,828 --> 00:15:24,245
Ten minutes recess.

393
00:15:24,296 --> 00:15:26,297
Why didn't you just
jump right in there?

394
00:15:26,382 --> 00:15:28,299
I get it--
you read a book that says

395
00:15:28,384 --> 00:15:29,617
you don't let the jury
sit with things.

396
00:15:29,668 --> 00:15:30,718
The only problem is...

397
00:15:30,786 --> 00:15:31,886
We're not inside
of a book.

398
00:15:31,954 --> 00:15:33,421
And I don't want
to seem defensive.

399
00:15:33,472 --> 00:15:35,512
Harvey, we still have
a ton of shit to hit him with.

400
00:15:35,558 --> 00:15:37,792
Were you in there?
They're buying what he's saying.

401
00:15:37,843 --> 00:15:39,283
Then we make them
buy something else.

402
00:15:39,311 --> 00:15:40,895
We got a pair of aces.

403
00:15:40,963 --> 00:15:42,347
If the jury believes that
Cameron's got three of a kind,

404
00:15:42,431 --> 00:15:44,632
we're not gonna win.
We can't go after Stephen.

405
00:15:44,683 --> 00:15:46,017
Cameron
won't go after Ava

406
00:15:46,101 --> 00:15:47,652
if I can convince him
it was Stephen.

407
00:15:47,736 --> 00:15:49,070
- You went to Cameron?
- Yes.

408
00:15:49,137 --> 00:15:50,638
And you're going
to trust him?

409
00:15:50,689 --> 00:15:53,140
I'm not sure
we have another choice.

410
00:15:55,945 --> 00:15:57,529
If you're thinking
what I think you're thinking,

411
00:15:57,613 --> 00:15:59,113
don't.

412
00:15:59,165 --> 00:16:01,032
I'm thinking I'd like
to rip your face off.

413
00:16:01,116 --> 00:16:02,717
You get Mariga
to point the finger at me,

414
00:16:02,785 --> 00:16:04,819
I will point it
straight at Ava.

415
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:07,589
Stephen, Jessica
doesn't respond well to threats.

416
00:16:07,656 --> 00:16:09,090
Well, I don't make threats.

417
00:16:09,157 --> 00:16:11,209
I give warnings.

418
00:16:11,293 --> 00:16:13,294
You've been warned.

419
00:16:19,218 --> 00:16:21,553
Mr. Specter...

420
00:16:21,637 --> 00:16:24,272
I have no questions
for Colonel Mariga, Your Honor,

421
00:16:24,339 --> 00:16:26,340
but I'd like to call
a rebuttal witness.

422
00:16:26,392 --> 00:16:28,193
Harvey, come on,
you know what he's gonna say.

423
00:16:28,194 --> 00:16:29,894
I don't care
what he's gonna say.

424
00:16:29,979 --> 00:16:31,896
He's talking to the jury.
I'm talking to Cameron Dennis.

425
00:16:31,981 --> 00:16:36,067
The defense calls
Stephen Huntley to the stand.

426
00:16:36,151 --> 00:16:38,887
What has Stephen Huntley
got to do with this?

427
00:16:38,954 --> 00:16:40,538
Harvey knows
what he's doing.

428
00:16:40,623 --> 00:16:41,906
This is what
you wanted to sell me--

429
00:16:41,991 --> 00:16:43,208
a lawyer from your own
goddamn firm?

430
00:16:43,292 --> 00:16:44,572
You want to put away
the bad guy?

431
00:16:44,627 --> 00:16:47,045
I'm about to hand him to you
on a silver platter.

432
00:16:47,129 --> 00:16:50,381
Mr. Huntley,
did you work at the law firm

433
00:16:50,466 --> 00:16:52,634
headed by Edward Darby
last year?

434
00:16:52,701 --> 00:16:54,302
Yes.

435
00:16:54,369 --> 00:16:56,971
Did Mr. Darby ask you
to solve any problems

436
00:16:57,039 --> 00:16:58,473
for Hessington Oil

437
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:00,675
regarding their pipeline
in the E.I.R.?

438
00:17:00,726 --> 00:17:02,810
I decline to answer under
my fifth amendment rights.

439
00:17:02,878 --> 00:17:05,063
The right
against self-incrimination.

440
00:17:05,147 --> 00:17:06,514
How long have you known
Colonel Mariga?

441
00:17:06,565 --> 00:17:07,732
I decline to answer.

442
00:17:07,816 --> 00:17:09,601
Is it true that you
went to school with him

443
00:17:09,685 --> 00:17:10,935
at the University
of Cape Town?

444
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:12,053
I decline to answer.

445
00:17:12,104 --> 00:17:13,521
Well, let me refresh
your memory.

446
00:17:13,572 --> 00:17:15,490
You were teammates
on a championship rugby team.

447
00:17:15,557 --> 00:17:17,575
Objection.
Counsel is testifying.

448
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:19,110
The witness is hostile,
Your Honor.

449
00:17:19,194 --> 00:17:21,029
Hostile? They work
at the same law firm.

450
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:22,530
He was fired yesterday.

451
00:17:22,581 --> 00:17:24,198
Gentlemen, approach.

452
00:17:27,202 --> 00:17:29,420
He's making things up
to create reasonable doubt.

453
00:17:29,505 --> 00:17:31,923
I'm bringing things up,
so you'll see the truth.

454
00:17:32,007 --> 00:17:34,676
The only thing tying Ava to this
is Mariga's testimony.

455
00:17:34,743 --> 00:17:37,595
You only have Mariga because
you tapped Stephen's phone.

456
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,913
That's a ridiculous
accusation.

457
00:17:38,964 --> 00:17:40,098
Cameron, please.

458
00:17:40,182 --> 00:17:42,934
Why did he call him?
How did he call him?

459
00:17:43,018 --> 00:17:44,435
Enough.

460
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,554
You're on a short leash,
Mr. Specter.

461
00:17:46,605 --> 00:17:49,090
The gentleman
invoked his rights.

462
00:17:53,428 --> 00:17:55,947
Mr. Huntley, did you meet
with your old friend

463
00:17:56,031 --> 00:17:58,599
Emmanuel Mariga
and direct him

464
00:17:58,651 --> 00:18:01,703
to kill the opponent
of Hessington Oil's pipeline

465
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:04,238
without Ava Hessington's
knowledge?

466
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:07,208
I decline to answer.

467
00:18:07,275 --> 00:18:08,876
I have
no further questions.

468
00:18:08,944 --> 00:18:11,629
Mr. Dennis,
do you have any questions?

469
00:18:13,248 --> 00:18:15,950
Mr. Dennis.

470
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:23,391
Mr. Huntley,
until you were let go,

471
00:18:23,458 --> 00:18:26,627
you worked at the same firm
as Mr. Specter, correct?

472
00:18:26,679 --> 00:18:28,295
Yes.

473
00:18:28,347 --> 00:18:31,149
And his job today
is to give this jury

474
00:18:31,233 --> 00:18:35,186
cause to doubt that
his client is the murderer?

475
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:37,138
- Yes.
- In your experience...

476
00:18:37,189 --> 00:18:39,691
Is pointing the finger
at someone else

477
00:18:39,775 --> 00:18:41,308
a good strategy?

478
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,578
It can be
an excellent strategy.

479
00:18:43,645 --> 00:18:46,080
And why do you think
that Mr. Specter

480
00:18:46,148 --> 00:18:47,865
is pointing the finger
at you?

481
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:49,834
Well, maybe it has something
to do with the fact

482
00:18:49,918 --> 00:18:52,987
that a few weeks ago
Ms. Hessington approached me

483
00:18:53,038 --> 00:18:54,372
and asked me
to bribe witnesses

484
00:18:54,456 --> 00:18:56,124
who were about
to testify against her,

485
00:18:56,175 --> 00:18:57,542
and I refused.

486
00:18:57,626 --> 00:18:59,210
And if you think
I'm lying under oath,

487
00:18:59,294 --> 00:19:02,213
then, please,
ask Mr. Specter.

488
00:19:02,297 --> 00:19:03,598
He knows that's the truth.

489
00:19:03,665 --> 00:19:06,551
And a woman who bribes
witnesses against her

490
00:19:06,635 --> 00:19:07,769
is not innocent.

491
00:19:07,836 --> 00:19:08,886
Objection.

492
00:19:08,971 --> 00:19:10,838
Withdrawn.
One last thing.

493
00:19:10,889 --> 00:19:13,941
Did the defendant
ask you to arrange a meeting

494
00:19:14,009 --> 00:19:16,310
with Colonel Mariga
where she she would pay him

495
00:19:16,362 --> 00:19:19,731
millions of dollars
in exchange for...

496
00:19:19,815 --> 00:19:21,733
Killing opponents
of her pipeline?

497
00:19:21,817 --> 00:19:24,035
I decline to answer.

498
00:19:24,119 --> 00:19:27,038
Can't blame a guy
for trying.

499
00:19:27,122 --> 00:19:28,740
No further questions.

500
00:19:38,046 --> 00:19:40,806
Is Stephen Huntley involved
in this,

501
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:43,989
or is it some kind of stunt like
he just told the jury it was?

502
00:19:50,723 --> 00:19:52,490
He ordered the killings.

503
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:55,609
- Why didn't you tell me?
- We didn't have proof.

504
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:57,944
Why would you put
that man on the stand?

505
00:19:58,012 --> 00:19:59,730
It was a calculated risk.

506
00:19:59,814 --> 00:20:02,449
You took a calculated risk
with my life

507
00:20:02,516 --> 00:20:05,685
without telling me.

508
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:07,630
I'm sorry.

509
00:20:17,474 --> 00:20:19,508
You screwed me.

510
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:21,010
I said
I wouldn't go after her

511
00:20:21,094 --> 00:20:22,978
if you convinced me--
you didn't convince me.

512
00:20:23,063 --> 00:20:24,180
Then take a recess

513
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:25,981
instead of twisting
everything he said.

514
00:20:26,066 --> 00:20:27,867
I'm not gonna let the jury
sit with that shit.

515
00:20:27,901 --> 00:20:29,318
And thank God I didn't.

516
00:20:29,403 --> 00:20:30,969
Otherwise,
I would have found out

517

It had nothing to do
with the murders.

520
00:20:35,826 --> 00:20:37,326
That's funny--
when I kept things from you

521
00:20:37,411 --> 00:20:38,778

with other murders,

523
00:20:39,913 --> 00:20:40,996
Well, that ended up
with you

524
00:20:41,081 --> 00:20:42,915
putting an innocent person
in prison.

And now you're doing it again.
Oh, don't give me that shit.

I don't wait for anyone.

Yes, I do.

to do this to you.

546

Now, we can negotiate
a settlement,

with you, Jessica.

the most direct hit.

Of course I didn't.

Well, that's exactly
what I was doing

604
00:23:46,132 --> 00:23:47,833
when I assigned Harvey
to the case.

605
00:23:47,884 --> 00:23:50,019
And after I was brought up
on murder charges,

606

who committed the crime.

Who were you trying
not to burden then?

609
00:24:08,187 --> 00:24:11,373
You once asked me if she knew
about her father and I.

610

Ava joined us and pretended
to be my girlfriend.

She did that for us.

00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:40,069
Ava is family to me.

619
00:24:40,153 --> 00:24:42,021
I sent Stephen out there
to help her.

Clifford.

692
00:27:44,878 --> 00:27:46,629
What the hell you doing out
in the middle of the night?

693
00:27:46,713 --> 00:27:47,830
Oh, you know, I told you.

694
00:27:47,914 --> 00:27:50,132
I got an urge
for some waffles.

695
00:27:50,217 --> 00:27:51,950
This isn't a coincidence,
is it?

696
00:27:52,002 --> 00:27:54,053
I need a favor.

697
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,554
No doubt.
What you need?

698
00:27:55,622 --> 00:27:58,140
I need you to talk
to Cameron Dennis.

699
00:27:58,225 --> 00:28:00,309
[Scoffs]
No.

700
00:28:00,393 --> 00:28:01,560
Hell, no.

701
00:28:01,628 --> 00:28:03,429
- Clifford...
- Look at me, man.

702
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,147
Look where I am...

703
00:28:05,232 --> 00:28:07,349
Cleaning up people's shit!
I know.

704
00:28:07,434 --> 00:28:09,485
You know this is all I can get
because of him?

705
00:28:09,569 --> 00:28:13,405
My life passed me by
because of that motherf--

706
00:28:13,473 --> 00:28:15,908
I get in a room with him,
I'll kill him.

707
00:28:15,975 --> 00:28:17,455
And I need you to tell him
all of that

708
00:28:17,494 --> 00:28:19,745
so that he doesn't do
the same thing to somebody else.

709
00:28:19,812 --> 00:28:22,164
You need?

710
00:28:22,249 --> 00:28:24,500
I know who "you" is.

711
00:28:24,584 --> 00:28:26,535
And I don't owe Harvey shit.

712
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:28,153
Now, he may have
got me out,

713
00:28:28,204 --> 00:28:30,489
but he and Cameron put me there
in the first place.

714
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:33,259
Yeah, you're right.
You don't owe Harvey.

715
00:28:33,326 --> 00:28:35,511
But you do owe me...

716
00:28:35,595 --> 00:28:37,846
'Cause I didn't have anything
to do with putting you in there,

717
00:28:37,931 --> 00:28:40,549
but I broke the law
to get you out.

718
00:28:47,674 --> 00:28:49,007
I am feeling generous,

719
00:28:49,059 --> 00:28:52,010
so absolutely, 100%,
without a doubt,

720
00:28:52,062 --> 00:28:53,779
go screw yourself.

721
00:28:53,846 --> 00:28:55,197
Everything okay?

722
00:28:55,282 --> 00:28:56,515
Yeah, of course.

723
00:28:56,566 --> 00:28:57,950
I was just using
tactic number 36

724
00:28:58,017 --> 00:28:59,685
in Louis Litt's handbook,
due to be published never

725
00:28:59,736 --> 00:29:01,320
because I don't share
my tactics.

726
00:29:01,371 --> 00:29:03,706
Tactic number seven,
by the way.

727
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:05,190
Okay.

728
00:29:05,241 --> 00:29:07,693
Well, whatever tactic you used
on Harold didn't work.

729
00:29:07,744 --> 00:29:09,128
He's not caving.

730
00:29:09,195 --> 00:29:10,629
I don't know
what you're talking about,

731
00:29:10,697 --> 00:29:12,081
because he gave me
everything I wanted.

732
00:29:12,165 --> 00:29:13,499
The client just called.

733
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:15,867
The contract Harold sent over
has a loophole in it.

734
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:18,504
It leaves him open
to punitive damages.

735
00:29:18,555 --> 00:29:21,039
Paragraph nine.

736
00:29:21,091 --> 00:29:22,641
Get that contract back.

737
00:29:22,709 --> 00:29:25,010
We need to renegotiate.

738
00:29:25,061 --> 00:29:28,063
Oh, my God, Harold
pulled one over on you.

739
00:29:28,148 --> 00:29:29,428
Don't you dare
say that out loud.

740
00:29:29,482 --> 00:29:30,716
Call him up,
set up the appointment

741
00:29:30,767 --> 00:29:32,434
for me to go over there.
I tried.

742
00:29:32,519 --> 00:29:34,770
He insisted on coming here.
He's on his way right now.

743
00:29:34,854 --> 00:29:36,071
He.

744
00:29:36,156 --> 00:29:39,725
[horns honking]

745
00:29:39,776 --> 00:29:41,910
What the hell
are you doing here?

746
00:29:41,995 --> 00:29:43,895
He's here
to tell you who you are.

747
00:29:43,947 --> 00:29:45,114
I know who I am.

748
00:29:45,198 --> 00:29:47,249
I don't need
to hear it from him.

749
00:29:47,334 --> 00:29:50,085
You think I'm giving you
a choice?

750
00:30:02,882 --> 00:30:06,218
Okay. We were supposed to meet
in the conference room.

751
00:30:06,269 --> 00:30:07,949
I don't need to wait
in the conference room

752
00:30:07,971 --> 00:30:09,588
to knock your dick
in the dirt.

753
00:30:09,639 --> 00:30:10,939
What'd you just say to me?

754
00:30:11,024 --> 00:30:12,591
It's from <i>The Breakfast Club,</i>
asshole.

755
00:30:12,642 --> 00:30:14,443
Not all of us only watch
<i>The Sound Of Music.</i>

756
00:30:14,527 --> 00:30:16,979
You little bastard.
You just crossed a line.

757
00:30:17,063 --> 00:30:19,264
Julie Andrews
is a national treasure.

758
00:30:19,315 --> 00:30:21,650
Maybe your client
would be better off with her.

759
00:30:21,735 --> 00:30:22,735
Maybe they would be.

760
00:30:22,786 --> 00:30:24,936
But she isn't here.
And I am.

761
00:30:24,988 --> 00:30:27,105
And here are a few
of my favorite things--

762
00:30:27,157 --> 00:30:28,991
countersuit for slander,

763
00:30:29,075 --> 00:30:30,993
motion to decertify class,

764
00:30:31,077 --> 00:30:32,795
motion for summary judgment,

765
00:30:32,879 --> 00:30:35,080
change of venue, sanctions,

766
00:30:35,131 --> 00:30:38,300
depositions, discovery!

767
00:30:38,385 --> 00:30:40,719
Great use
of folders there, Louis.

768
00:30:40,787 --> 00:30:42,504
Too bad none of them
are gonna work.

769
00:30:42,589 --> 00:30:44,122
Well, they may not work
on the case,

770
00:30:44,174 --> 00:30:46,308
but they're definitely
gonna work on you.

771
00:30:46,393 --> 00:30:47,893
What are you talking about?

772
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,961
Oh, I'm talking
about you may win in the end,

773
00:30:50,013 --> 00:30:52,848
but it won't justify you
spending every waking minute

774
00:30:52,932 --> 00:30:54,349
of your life
on this bullshit,

775
00:30:54,434 --> 00:30:57,352
instead of doing everything else
you've been assigned to do.

776
00:30:57,437 --> 00:30:59,738
- You'd do that to me?
- I won't be doing it to you.

777
00:30:59,806 --> 00:31:01,740
I'll be doing it
for Bratton Gould.

778
00:31:01,808 --> 00:31:03,242
And you'll be laughed
out of there

779
00:31:03,309 --> 00:31:04,949
the same way you were laughed
out of here.

780
00:31:04,977 --> 00:31:06,578
- Louis--
- We got nothing left to say!

781
00:31:06,646 --> 00:31:08,330
Drop the suit
by the end of the week,

782
00:31:08,415 --> 00:31:10,699
or one of my associates
will see you in court.

783
00:31:10,784 --> 00:31:11,834
Get out!

784
00:31:25,215 --> 00:31:27,349
I don't want him here.

785
00:31:27,434 --> 00:31:30,686
Ava, whatever he did,
he's here to help,

786
00:31:30,770 --> 00:31:32,871
and he's an asset.

787
00:31:32,939 --> 00:31:36,007
Then what does the mighty
Edward Darby have to say?

788
00:31:36,059 --> 00:31:38,060
You're innocent
until proven guilty

789
00:31:38,144 --> 00:31:39,645
beyond a reasonable doubt.

790
00:31:39,696 --> 00:31:40,863
Take the stand.

791
00:31:40,947 --> 00:31:43,315
Any juror that hears you
will have that doubt.

792
00:31:43,366 --> 00:31:44,900
She opens that door,
the first question

793
00:31:44,984 --> 00:31:47,986
Cameron asks is, did she try
and bribe those witnesses?

794
00:31:48,037 --> 00:31:52,908
The answer is yes.
There goes reasonable doubt.

795
00:31:52,992 --> 00:31:54,293
How much did you pay him?

796
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:56,044
- Cameron.
- Pay who?

797
00:31:56,129 --> 00:31:58,714
Don't play dumb.
Clifford Danner.

798
00:31:58,798 --> 00:32:00,582
Who the hell
is Clifford Danner?

799
00:32:00,667 --> 00:32:03,051
He was an innocent person
that Cameron put behind bars.

800
00:32:03,136 --> 00:32:04,816
And I thought
he would make you see reason.

801
00:32:04,871 --> 00:32:06,054
That has nothing
to do with this.

802
00:32:06,139 --> 00:32:07,706
And I didn't put him
behind bars--you did.

803
00:32:07,757 --> 00:32:09,141
Then I got him out.

804
00:32:09,208 --> 00:32:11,059
Well, you're not getting
her out, because she did it,

805
00:32:11,144 --> 00:32:13,812
and yesterday your own colleague
said that she did it.

806
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:16,265
He did not say that,
and you know it.

807
00:32:16,349 --> 00:32:18,350
- You willing to take that risk?
- What are you suggesting?

808
00:32:18,401 --> 00:32:19,852
I've worked with him
long enough

809
00:32:19,903 --> 00:32:21,236
to know what he's suggesting.

810
00:32:21,321 --> 00:32:23,155
Cameron Dennis
doesn't go to verdict.

811
00:32:23,222 --> 00:32:24,857
He cuts deals.
Then let me tell you...

812
00:32:24,908 --> 00:32:27,409
About what's
behind door number one--

813
00:32:27,494 --> 00:32:29,060
Eight years.

814
00:32:30,446 --> 00:32:33,499
Eight years instead of forever.
Leave us alone.

815
00:32:33,566 --> 00:32:36,168
Court's in ten minutes.
You have until then.

816
00:32:36,235 --> 00:32:37,569
[Door opens]

817
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:39,171
Harvey...

818
00:32:39,238 --> 00:32:40,956
He's got us,
and you know it.

819
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,207
No, he doesn't.

820
00:32:42,258 --> 00:32:44,126
She's not going to prison
for one day.

821
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:46,011
She's going
for the rest of her life

822
00:32:46,078 --> 00:32:47,746
if we don't take this deal.

823
00:32:47,797 --> 00:32:49,431
I am not losing to him.

824
00:32:49,516 --> 00:32:52,250
You-your blood feud

825
00:32:52,302 --> 00:32:54,303
or whatever it is
you have with that man

826
00:32:54,387 --> 00:32:57,306
is what put the target
on my back in the first place.

827
00:32:57,390 --> 00:32:59,942
Ava, we need
to face reality.

828
00:33:00,026 --> 00:33:02,361
She is not taking that deal.

829
00:33:02,428 --> 00:33:05,447
She better, because
she can't buy her way out of it.

830
00:33:05,532 --> 00:33:07,933
And you can't cover up
your way out of it.

831
00:33:07,984 --> 00:33:09,434
- I don't care.
- Well, what's your idea?

832
00:33:09,485 --> 00:33:10,869
Because unless
you're gonna testify

833
00:33:10,937 --> 00:33:13,038
that Stephen did this
without Ava's knowledge,

834
00:33:13,105 --> 00:33:14,239
you can't help.

835
00:33:14,290 --> 00:33:15,991
And as you said,
you have no proof.

836
00:33:16,075 --> 00:33:19,578
So why don't you get out of the
room and let the grown-ups talk?

837
00:33:19,629 --> 00:33:22,497
What if I was
to testify to that?

838
00:33:24,417 --> 00:33:26,001
What are you talking about?

839
00:33:26,085 --> 00:33:28,670
I'm talking about putting
words to a conversation

840
00:33:28,755 --> 00:33:30,973
that should have happened
but didn't.

841
00:33:31,057 --> 00:33:34,476
You'd say that you confronted
Stephen, and he admitted it?

842
00:33:34,561 --> 00:33:37,462
I made this mess.
It's up to me to clear it up.

843
00:33:37,513 --> 00:33:38,964
This isn't gonna help.

844
00:33:39,015 --> 00:33:41,633
You're her old friend coming
to her aid at the last second.

845
00:33:41,684 --> 00:33:42,768
It's a lie.

846
00:33:42,819 --> 00:33:44,186
The jury will see
right through it.

847
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:45,854
Then we need to make Cameron
believe it.

848
00:33:45,939 --> 00:33:47,856
Harvey, Cameron wants a win.

849
00:33:47,941 --> 00:33:49,858
You need to convince him
this is a win.

850
00:33:49,943 --> 00:33:52,578
Can you do that?

851
00:33:52,645 --> 00:33:55,998
I guess it's the best shot
we have.

852
00:34:06,192 --> 00:34:09,008
I knew you would cave.
With five minutes to spare.

853
00:34:09,716 --> 00:34:11,549
We're not here
to take your offer, Cameron.

854
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:12,851
We want you to take ours.

855
00:34:12,935 --> 00:34:15,169
Nah, I'm not negotiating.
Eight years is final.

856
00:34:15,221 --> 00:34:16,838
This isn't about making
a deal for Ava.

857
00:34:16,889 --> 00:34:18,273
It's about making
a deal for me.

858
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:21,175
If he's got something
to say about this,

859
00:34:21,227 --> 00:34:23,278
you should put him
on the stand.

860
00:34:23,345 --> 00:34:27,065
I already trusted you once.
I need your word.

861
00:34:27,149 --> 00:34:29,017
Go ahead.
Off the record.

862
00:34:29,068 --> 00:34:32,487
I instructed Stephen Huntley
