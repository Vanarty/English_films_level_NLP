1
00:00:01,691 --> 00:00:03,675
I'm looking at a bribe,
plain as day.

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:05,092
That's exactly
what it is.

3
00:00:05,093 --> 00:00:07,733
Tony Gianopolous got a hold
of that video somehow.

4
00:00:07,734 --> 00:00:09,202
I think he's trying
to take over the company.

5
00:00:09,286 --> 00:00:11,537
You son of a bitch,
you leaked it.

6
00:00:11,622 --> 00:00:13,322
Ava Hessington
is Hessington Oil.

7
00:00:13,373 --> 00:00:15,158
- Not for long.
- Excuse me?

8
00:00:15,209 --> 00:00:17,193
- This is my call.
- I'm afraid it isn't.

9
00:00:17,244 --> 00:00:19,545
You'd like her to remove
herself from management?

10
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:21,798
I'm not going to stand
for losing this takeover.

11
00:00:21,865 --> 00:00:24,717
Then don't,
but Ava isn't going anywhere.

12
00:00:24,802 --> 00:00:27,036
I just got voted
out of my own company.

13
00:00:27,087 --> 00:00:29,138
I stand by my decision,
and I'd do it again.

14
00:00:29,206 --> 00:00:30,590
Don't tell me it doesn't
have to do with Darby.

15
00:00:30,674 --> 00:00:33,976
You're the one who gave him
the 51% in the first place.

16
00:00:34,044 --> 00:00:36,212
You can't stand
being number two.

17
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:40,099
Please tell me
you're calling me

18
00:00:40,184 --> 00:00:41,484
because you've been kidnapped.

19
00:00:41,551 --> 00:00:42,885
I'm not the one
who disappeared.

20
00:00:42,936 --> 00:00:44,437
I told you I had a thing.

21
00:00:44,521 --> 00:00:46,823
At 1:00.
It's 1:45.

22
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:48,491
And it's called
a lunch hour, Harvey.

23
00:00:48,558 --> 00:00:51,894
60 whole minutes,
which my teeth deserve.

24
00:00:51,945 --> 00:00:53,362
You fit the dentist in
at lunch?

25
00:00:53,413 --> 00:00:54,897
He can be
surprisingly quick,

26
00:00:54,948 --> 00:00:56,282
yet remarkably thorough.

27
00:00:56,366 --> 00:00:58,284
Donna, Judge Atkins
is ready to hear

28
00:00:58,368 --> 00:01:01,570
my motion for summary judgment,
which she won't do

29
00:01:01,622 --> 00:01:03,239
if there aren't
two copies of that motion

30
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:05,091
in my hands
in ten minutes.

31
00:01:05,175 --> 00:01:06,459
All right,
here's what you're gonna do.

32
00:01:06,543 --> 00:01:08,344
Go to my computer
and press "print."

33
00:01:08,411 --> 00:01:09,929
Pick the motions up
off the printer,

34
00:01:10,013 --> 00:01:12,248
then walk over to the corner,
throw everything in the trash,

35
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:13,466
because there's already
two copies

36
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:15,301
on your desk
at this very moment.

37
00:01:15,385 --> 00:01:18,187
So the trash can's
in the corner then?

38
00:01:18,255 --> 00:01:20,589
Bye.

39
00:01:23,977 --> 00:01:25,978
You had "a thing"?

40
00:01:26,063 --> 00:01:27,763
Well...

41
00:01:27,814 --> 00:01:30,066
Two things.

42
00:01:30,117 --> 00:01:33,953
But who's counting?

43
00:01:34,037 --> 00:01:36,739
What did he want anyway?

44
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:39,709
I thought we agreed
not to talk about work at lunch.

45
00:01:39,776 --> 00:01:42,995
Yeah, we did, but we also
agreed to have lunch at lunch.

46
00:01:44,248 --> 00:01:46,832
Yeah, you're right.

47
00:01:46,917 --> 00:01:50,619
It's just that, uh,
I've always made it my business

48
00:01:50,671 --> 00:01:52,889
knowing about things.

49
00:01:52,956 --> 00:01:55,424
And you're good
at your business.

50
00:01:55,475 --> 00:01:57,009
Mmm, business is good.

51
00:01:57,094 --> 00:02:00,012
Ooh,
some might say booming.

52
00:02:02,132 --> 00:02:03,432
Listen, we've only
got 15 minutes left,

53
00:02:03,483 --> 00:02:06,468
so I'll endeavor
to be surprisingly quick.

54
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:09,855
As long as you continue
to be remarkably thorough.

55
00:02:14,194 --> 00:02:16,529
Your Honor, you said
you would dismiss this case

56
00:02:16,613 --> 00:02:18,114
if he couldn't
produce evidence

57
00:02:18,165 --> 00:02:20,316
beyond the bribery tape.
Well, he couldn't.

58
00:02:20,367 --> 00:02:22,084
We found five witnesses
that tied the man

59
00:02:22,152 --> 00:02:24,313
that Ava Hessington bribed
on that tape to the murders.

60
00:02:24,338 --> 00:02:26,339
And those witnesses
refused to come forward.

61
00:02:26,423 --> 00:02:27,540
If we can't confront them,

62
00:02:27,624 --> 00:02:28,657
then their statements
are inadmissible.

63
00:02:28,709 --> 00:02:29,825
Just because
they won't come forward

64
00:02:29,876 --> 00:02:31,210
doesn't mean
they don't exist.

65
00:02:31,295 --> 00:02:32,545
He's right, their statements
may be inadmissible,

66
00:02:32,629 --> 00:02:35,131
but I can't ignore the fact
that they were made.

67
00:02:35,182 --> 00:02:38,434
Well, in that case,
we move for an expedited trial.

68
00:02:38,501 --> 00:02:41,520
Ten seconds ago,
he was moving for a dismissal.

69
00:02:41,605 --> 00:02:43,522
And in the ten seconds since,

70
00:02:43,607 --> 00:02:45,841
public opinion of my client
has gone down even further.

71
00:02:45,892 --> 00:02:47,193
She's a murderer.
How much lower can it go?

72
00:02:47,277 --> 00:02:48,444
Well, you tell me.

73
00:02:48,511 --> 00:02:50,031
You leaked evidence
to Tony Gianopolous

74
00:02:50,113 --> 00:02:51,814
that lost her
her company.

75
00:02:51,865 --> 00:02:53,149
You might leak it
to anyone.

76
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,700
Your Honor, we've been
down this road before.

77
00:02:54,785 --> 00:02:56,452
It's called
bullshit highway.

78
00:02:56,519 --> 00:02:59,205
All dragging this out does
is delay Ava Hessington

79
00:02:59,289 --> 00:03:01,040
the opportunity
to vindicate herself.

80
00:03:01,124 --> 00:03:04,493
It also conveniently gives me
less time to build my case.

81
00:03:04,544 --> 00:03:06,212
But the case you just argued
was solid enough to go to trial.

82
00:03:06,296 --> 00:03:08,047
You're letting your mini-me
make your arguments for you now?

83
00:03:08,131 --> 00:03:09,048
Are you letting
your moustache--

84
00:03:09,132 --> 00:03:10,299
Enough.

85
00:03:10,367 --> 00:03:12,368
The trial starts
a week from Monday.

86
00:03:12,419 --> 00:03:13,586
Get out.

87
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:15,537
You still haven't told
Harvey about Stephen?

88
00:03:15,589 --> 00:03:17,757
I went to tell him,
but he was in a bad mood,

89
00:03:17,841 --> 00:03:19,392
and then somehow
I ended up telling him

90
00:03:19,476 --> 00:03:21,010
that I made some copies
for Stephen,

91
00:03:21,061 --> 00:03:22,928
and he got
really pissed.

92
00:03:23,013 --> 00:03:25,047
What's he gonna do
when he finds out about this?

93
00:03:25,098 --> 00:03:27,650
Whoa, but I thought you said
that you two had never--

94
00:03:27,717 --> 00:03:28,985
So?

95
00:03:29,052 --> 00:03:30,236
So I get why he doesn't want
to share you here.

96
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,687
You're his everything here.

97
00:03:31,738 --> 00:03:33,072
But what you're doing
with Stephen isn't here,

98
00:03:33,156 --> 00:03:34,940
it's there.
Two completely different things.

99
00:03:35,025 --> 00:03:37,226
Then why did you tell me
I had to tell him?

100
00:03:37,277 --> 00:03:38,560
To let him know
that your there and his here

101
00:03:38,612 --> 00:03:40,746
can coexist
in the same place.

102
00:03:40,831 --> 00:03:42,415
I liked it better when
we talked about you and Mike.

103
00:03:42,499 --> 00:03:43,449
I'm sure you did.

104
00:03:43,533 --> 00:03:46,285
So are you two
going to keep--

105
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:48,788
Yes, it is some
of the best damn...

106
00:03:48,872 --> 00:03:50,923
Yoga I've had
in a long time.

107
00:03:51,008 --> 00:03:52,258
Well, sooner or later,
he's gonna find out,

108
00:03:52,342 --> 00:03:54,377
because it is
all over your face.

109
00:03:54,428 --> 00:03:55,577
Oh, please,
you're a woman.

110
00:03:55,629 --> 00:03:57,797
Men are oblivious.

111
00:03:57,881 --> 00:04:00,182
There's something
different about you.

112
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:01,550
What is it?

113
00:04:01,601 --> 00:04:04,136
Yes, please tell the man
what it is.

114
00:04:04,221 --> 00:04:05,271
Nothing, Louis.

115
00:04:05,355 --> 00:04:06,689
I'm just--
been doing some yoga.

116
00:04:06,756 --> 00:04:08,858
No, that's not it.

117
00:04:08,925 --> 00:04:10,226
You're practically glowing.

118
00:04:10,277 --> 00:04:12,094
Tell me your secret.

119
00:04:12,145 --> 00:04:14,530
Ii don't think
that it's your cup of tea.

120
00:04:14,597 --> 00:04:16,598
For that glow,
I'd tea.

121
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:18,451
I'm gonna have to keep this
to myself, Louis.

122
00:04:18,535 --> 00:04:19,935
Okay, well, promise me
you'll keep doing

123
00:04:19,986 --> 00:04:21,654
whatever it is you're doing.
I think she can do that.

124
00:04:21,738 --> 00:04:23,489
No, I'm serious, Donna.
Morning, noon, and night.

125
00:04:23,573 --> 00:04:25,157
Five times a day
if necessary.

126
00:04:25,242 --> 00:04:26,208
I will do my best.

127
00:04:26,276 --> 00:04:28,277
Mm.

128
00:04:31,114 --> 00:04:34,800
- Well, we did our best.
- Our best?

129
00:04:34,885 --> 00:04:37,119
Wait a minute,
you never expected this case

130
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:38,671
to get dismissed.

131
00:04:38,755 --> 00:04:40,172
Then why would I ask for it?

132
00:04:40,257 --> 00:04:42,641
Because she was more likely
to grant an expedited trial

133
00:04:42,726 --> 00:04:44,126
after saying no
to a dismissal.

134
00:04:44,177 --> 00:04:46,962
And now, Cameron's
got a shitty case to try

135
00:04:47,013 --> 00:04:50,232
with no evidence and less
than two weeks to get any more.

136
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,234
Wait a second.

137
00:04:52,302 --> 00:04:54,487
What if they didn't just have
to scramble for new evidence?

138
00:04:54,571 --> 00:04:56,355
What if they had to scramble
for a whole new lawyer?

139
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,240
Any lawyer who got
assigned this case

140
00:04:58,308 --> 00:05:00,576
with only two weeks to go
would drop the whole thing.

141
00:05:00,643 --> 00:05:02,111
Unless they had
a personal beef with you,

142
00:05:02,162 --> 00:05:03,645
which they wouldn't.
There's only one way

143
00:05:03,697 --> 00:05:05,247
to get Cameron
thrown off this case.

144
00:05:05,315 --> 00:05:06,866
Prove he colluded
with Gianopolous.

145
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:10,586
Turn bullshit highway into...
fact highway.

146
00:05:10,653 --> 00:05:11,670
Fact highway?

147
00:05:11,755 --> 00:05:12,988
Yeah, you know,
it's right next

148
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:15,541
to "I don't want to talk
about this anymore" lane.

149
00:05:15,625 --> 00:05:17,626
We're gonna have to talk
about how to prove they colluded

150
00:05:17,677 --> 00:05:20,162
because we have a chance
to get rid of this murder charge

151
00:05:20,213 --> 00:05:21,830

you wanted to see me.

163
00:05:58,161 --> 00:06:00,121
Hey, Simon, come on in.
I have a question for you.

164
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,814
Come on, you need
to see this.

165
00:06:02,898 --> 00:06:04,482
Look at this.
This is so funny.

166
00:06:04,567 --> 00:06:05,733
Is that
some sort of joke?

00:06:13,742 --> 00:06:16,110
- "Shall"?
- Mm.

173
00:06:16,162 --> 00:06:19,380
At this firm, we instruct,
we advise, we order,

174
00:06:19,448 --> 00:06:21,883
we must,
but we do not "shall."

175
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:23,585
- That's not really a--
- Why must we "must"?

176
00:06:23,636 --> 00:06:25,720
Because we thrust,
we don't parry.

177
00:06:25,787 --> 00:06:27,755
Rewrite this.

178
00:06:27,806 --> 00:06:30,091
I can't.

179
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:32,627
Excuse me?

180
00:06:32,678 --> 00:06:33,928
Mr. Nesbitt has clearly
instructed us--

181
00:06:33,979 --> 00:06:36,314
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
This was Nigel's doing?

182
00:06:36,398 --> 00:06:37,732
Per his most recent memo.

183
00:06:37,799 --> 00:06:39,767
He's communicating
with you through memos?

184
00:06:39,818 --> 00:06:41,819
You've been left adrift
on lady law's fickle ocean

185
00:06:41,904 --> 00:06:43,238
with no rudder,
no captain?

186
00:06:43,305 --> 00:06:44,972
He hasn't been
in the office

187
00:06:45,024 --> 00:06:46,357
since he took over
the program,

188
00:06:46,442 --> 00:06:47,563
if that's
what you're asking.

189
00:06:47,576 --> 00:06:48,493
No, I think
I was perfectly clear

190
00:06:48,577 --> 00:06:50,445
in what I was asking,
Simon.

191
00:06:50,496 --> 00:06:51,529
Am I supposed
to respond to that?

192
00:06:51,614 --> 00:06:52,780
Yeah, by going back

193
00:06:52,831 --> 00:06:53,698
to your desk right now
and doing it correctly.

194
00:06:53,782 --> 00:06:54,699
But--

195
00:06:54,783 --> 00:06:55,917
Simon,
a memo from Nigel

196
00:06:55,984 --> 00:06:57,001
is not gonna stick
its boot in your ass.

197
00:06:57,086 --> 00:07:00,004
A memo from me will.
Get out.

198
00:07:07,963 --> 00:07:10,098
I told you,
not at the office.

199
00:07:10,165 --> 00:07:11,999
You mean I can't see Harvey
at the office?

200
00:07:12,051 --> 00:07:13,167
'Cause that's what
I'm here to do.

201
00:07:13,219 --> 00:07:14,886
- Oh.
- Oh.

202
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:15,937
- What?
- You know what.

203
00:07:16,004 --> 00:07:17,004
You haven't told him yet.

204
00:07:17,022 --> 00:07:18,356
It's none
of his business.

205
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:21,559
He and I are here,
and you and I are...there.

206
00:07:21,644 --> 00:07:22,677
I wish we were there.

207
00:07:22,728 --> 00:07:24,062
I just told you,
not here.

208
00:07:24,146 --> 00:07:25,280
Donna, what's going on
out there?

209
00:07:25,347 --> 00:07:27,115
I think he means
out here.

210
00:07:27,182 --> 00:07:29,484
You have a walk-in.

211
00:07:31,654 --> 00:07:32,654
What are you doing here?

212
00:07:32,705 --> 00:07:34,188
What I've always
been doing here,

213
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,040
representing
Edward Darby's wishes.

214
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:37,709
I lost Ava her company.

215
00:07:37,793 --> 00:07:40,578
I assume my deal
with Edward is dead.

216
00:07:40,663 --> 00:07:42,964
Well, Edward doesn't
see it like that.

217
00:07:43,031 --> 00:07:44,165
You may have failed,

218
00:07:44,216 --> 00:07:46,334
but Jessica took a shot
at her own team.

219
00:07:46,385 --> 00:07:48,002
And the consequences of that
are what?

220
00:07:48,053 --> 00:07:49,504
Deal stays in place

221
00:07:49,555 --> 00:07:51,556
as long as you win
her murder trial.

222
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:54,142
What if my plan is
to not even have a murder trial?

223
00:07:54,209 --> 00:07:55,876
Well, as long
as you don't accomplish that

224
00:07:55,928 --> 00:07:58,646
by having Ava plead guilty,

225
00:07:58,714 --> 00:08:00,348
you'll be
the next managing partner.

226
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:02,883
Good, because I'm going
to accomplish it

227
00:08:02,935 --> 00:08:04,819
by getting Cameron Dennis
thrown off this case

228
00:08:04,886 --> 00:08:06,821
for colluding
with Tony Gianopolous.

229
00:08:06,888 --> 00:08:08,856
And how are you
going to accomplish that?

230
00:08:08,907 --> 00:08:10,908
By suing
Tony Gianopolous.

231
00:08:10,993 --> 00:08:11,943
For what?

232
00:08:12,027 --> 00:08:13,278
For this...
or this...

233
00:08:13,362 --> 00:08:16,781
And/or that.

234
00:08:29,962 --> 00:08:31,045
- Yeah, that's good.
- Mm-hmm.

235
00:08:31,096 --> 00:08:32,747
- It is.
- Yeah.

236
00:08:32,798 --> 00:08:35,800
- But I can do better.
- No way.

237
00:08:35,884 --> 00:08:37,969
$5,000 says I can.

238
00:08:38,053 --> 00:08:41,189
$10,000 says you can't.

239
00:08:41,256 --> 00:08:42,890
Excellent.

240
00:08:42,941 --> 00:08:44,976
What's your idea?

241
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,694
Well, it requires you
to take me with you

242
00:08:46,762 --> 00:08:48,730
to see Mr. Gianopolous.
Mike?

243
00:08:48,781 --> 00:08:51,399
- Yeah.
- You're off the case.

244
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:52,984
What? You're gonna let him
get away with that?

245
00:08:53,068 --> 00:08:54,235
I have to.
I just took a bet.

246
00:08:54,286 --> 00:08:55,603
There's no going back
on a bet.

247
00:08:55,654 --> 00:08:57,238
Okay, what if I bet him
that my idea's better?

248
00:08:57,289 --> 00:08:58,239
Then can I come?

249
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:01,442
You gonna pony up
$10,000?

250
00:09:01,493 --> 00:09:04,462
Best of luck, guys.
Hope it works out.

251
00:09:06,248 --> 00:09:07,332
So you're off the case?

252
00:09:07,416 --> 00:09:09,334
Yeah,
thanks to Stephen Huntley.

253
00:09:09,418 --> 00:09:12,086
Well, doesn't he have his hand
in a lot of cookie jars?

254
00:09:12,137 --> 00:09:14,722
- What does that mean?
- Nothing.

255
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:16,974
Wait a second,
"nothing" never means nothing.

256
00:09:17,059 --> 00:09:18,593
Sometimes
it means something.

257
00:09:18,644 --> 00:09:20,461
Ah, do you want me
to force it out of you?

258
00:09:20,512 --> 00:09:22,847
I may or may not need
plausible deniability.

259
00:09:22,931 --> 00:09:26,100
- Rachel.
- Donna slept with Stephen.

260
00:09:26,151 --> 00:09:28,186
Holy shit.

261
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:29,904
You cannot let her know
that you know.

262
00:09:29,971 --> 00:09:31,155
- Does Harvey know?
- No, not yet.

263
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,573
Don't you dare tell him.

264
00:09:32,641 --> 00:09:34,192
Yeah, like I'm gonna
touch that with a 10-foot pole.

265
00:09:34,276 --> 00:09:36,143
But he's gonna care
that she didn't tell him.

266
00:09:37,479 --> 00:09:41,649
So how are you gonna
get back on that case?

267
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,984
Um, I got
a different case.

268
00:09:44,036 --> 00:09:45,286
Graham Stenton.

269
00:09:45,337 --> 00:09:47,088
The accountant
who embezzled

270
00:09:47,155 --> 00:09:49,791
$30 million from our client?
Yep.

271
00:09:49,842 --> 00:09:52,293
And our job is to get
the money back, quietly.

272
00:09:52,344 --> 00:09:53,628
Our job
as in Pearson Darby?

273
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:55,329
Our job
as in you and me.

274
00:09:55,381 --> 00:09:57,348
I'm interviewing
his associate this afternoon,

275
00:09:57,433 --> 00:10:00,184
and I need your help.

276
00:10:00,269 --> 00:10:02,854
You want me to be the Mike
to your Harvey.

277
00:10:04,973 --> 00:10:07,141
I do want you to be
the Mike to my Harvey.

278
00:10:07,192 --> 00:10:08,309
Yeah, well,
it's not really a thing.

279
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,777
It can be.

280
00:10:09,845 --> 00:10:11,279
- Huh.
- Huh.

281
00:10:11,346 --> 00:10:12,680
I get to ask
half the questions.

282
00:10:12,731 --> 00:10:15,233
Oh, Harvey doesn't let Mike
ask half the questions.

283
00:10:15,317 --> 00:10:16,567
Fine, 1/3.

284
00:10:16,652 --> 00:10:18,286
Harvey doesn't
negotiate with Mike.

285
00:10:18,353 --> 00:10:20,187
Mike doesn't have sex
with Harvey.

286
00:10:22,408 --> 00:10:24,692
1/3 of the questions
seems reasonable to me.

287
00:10:35,137 --> 00:10:38,423
Could you possibly keep
your thwacking to yourself?

288
00:10:38,507 --> 00:10:40,508
This is a private club.

289
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:42,176
With a sister club
in London.

290
00:10:42,227 --> 00:10:44,545
Courtesy mudding
privileges.

291
00:10:44,596 --> 00:10:47,014
And, yes,
it's Turkish.

292
00:10:47,065 --> 00:10:49,100
Outside mud is a clear
violation of club policy.

293
00:10:49,184 --> 00:10:50,551
There are rules,
Nigel.

294
00:10:50,602 --> 00:10:52,386
Just as there are rules
forbidding interference

295
00:10:52,438 --> 00:10:53,771
with my associates.

296
00:10:53,856 --> 00:10:58,192
Yeah, well, you don't give
a rat's ass about them.

297
00:10:58,243 --> 00:10:59,660
How dare you?

298
00:10:59,728 --> 00:11:01,829
You know, let me tell you
something you may not know.

299
00:11:01,897 --> 00:11:04,499
Associates,
they're like grains of sand.

300
00:11:04,566 --> 00:11:06,117
They need pressure
and heat

301
00:11:06,201 --> 00:11:08,068
to shape them
into Chihuly glass.

302
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,755
Memos from a distant land
don't shape shit into shit.

303
00:11:10,839 --> 00:11:12,206
Nonsense.

304
00:11:12,257 --> 00:11:14,909
I attended boarding school
from the tender age of four,

305
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,577
during which time
I received weekly memos

306
00:11:16,628 --> 00:11:17,912
from my father.

307
00:11:17,963 --> 00:11:19,347
Yeah, and look
how you turned out.

308
00:11:19,414 --> 00:11:21,415
Graduating summa cum laude
from both Cambridge

309
00:11:21,467 --> 00:11:23,434
and Harvard
is quite the failure.

310
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,938
Your parents' choice
to "homeschool," much better.

311
00:11:27,022 --> 00:11:28,255
Okay, that was only
till I was ten,

312
00:11:28,307 --> 00:11:30,090
and my mother's science fair
was legendary.

313
00:11:30,142 --> 00:11:33,277
You must be so proud of
your uncontested blue ribbons.

314
00:11:33,362 --> 00:11:35,780
Okay, you know what,

315
00:11:35,864 --> 00:11:37,698
I'm not gonna let you
shatter the glass

316
00:11:37,766 --> 00:11:39,233
that I spent years blowing.

317
00:11:39,284 --> 00:11:40,985
And I'm certainly not gonna
let the likes of you

318
00:11:41,069 --> 00:11:43,437
tell me who I can
and cannot blow.

319
00:11:47,576 --> 00:11:48,776
He's not gonna come.

320
00:11:48,827 --> 00:11:49,777
He will.

321
00:11:49,828 --> 00:11:51,462
You pushed his assistant?

322
00:11:51,547 --> 00:11:52,547
I charmed her.

323
00:11:52,614 --> 00:11:54,048
You didn't.

324
00:11:54,115 --> 00:11:56,584
He's right,
you didn't.

325
00:11:56,635 --> 00:11:59,504
She was irritated.

326
00:11:59,588 --> 00:12:01,121
But I was curious.

327
00:12:01,173 --> 00:12:02,473
Works for me.

328
00:12:02,558 --> 00:12:05,593
You know what they say
about curiosity.

329
00:12:08,797 --> 00:12:10,014
I get it.

330
00:12:10,098 --> 00:12:13,017
I come after Hessington Oil,
you come after me.

331
00:12:13,101 --> 00:12:14,685
Well, bring it on, boys.

332
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:15,853
I got a team of lawyers

333
00:12:15,938 --> 00:12:17,522
just itching
to take your lunch money.

334
00:12:17,606 --> 00:12:19,887
Well, unfortunately, you're
not gonna be able to use them.

335
00:12:19,908 --> 00:12:21,308
He's not gonna
sue you here.

336
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,244
He's gonna sue you
in London,

337
00:12:23,311 --> 00:12:25,029
where you have
countless holdings.

338
00:12:25,113 --> 00:12:27,331
Where the burden of proof
isn't on the plaintiff.

339
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:28,866
It's on the defendant.

340
00:12:28,951 --> 00:12:30,835
So instead of us
having to prove you're guilty,

341
00:12:30,919 --> 00:12:32,703
you'll have to prove
you're innocent.

342
00:12:32,788 --> 00:12:34,255
Doesn't look
very innocent.

343
00:12:34,322 --> 00:12:35,489
So you guys think
I'm gonna run scared

344
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:38,509
at the prospect of losing
a little money.

345
00:12:38,594 --> 00:12:41,712
I'm a corporate raider.

346
00:12:41,797 --> 00:12:45,967
This is a $50,000 bond.

347
00:12:46,018 --> 00:12:50,104
You see, I'm not in
this business for the money.

348
00:12:50,171 --> 00:12:52,440
Money's just
about keeping score.

349
00:12:52,507 --> 00:12:54,775
I'm in this business
to win.

350
00:12:54,843 --> 00:12:56,060
Well, here's the thing,
Tony.

351
00:12:56,144 --> 00:12:57,728
This trial's
gonna take a while.

352
00:12:57,813 --> 00:12:59,480
You'll be going
to hearing after hearing,

353
00:12:59,531 --> 00:13:01,399
deposition
after deposition.

354
00:13:01,483 --> 00:13:03,363
You won't be able
to enjoy your business at all.

355
00:13:03,402 --> 00:13:05,185
So even if you win,
you lose.

356
00:13:05,237 --> 00:13:06,571
Or?

357
00:13:06,655 --> 00:13:08,956
Well, I...
I could withdraw the suit.

358
00:13:09,024 --> 00:13:12,159
And all that'll cost you
is the truth,

359
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:14,462
that you colluded
with Cameron Dennis.

360
00:13:14,529 --> 00:13:16,247
Ah, but I didn't
collude shit.

361
00:13:16,331 --> 00:13:17,715
Yes, you did,

362
00:13:17,799 --> 00:13:20,167
when you let him leak you
that video of Ava Hessington,

363
00:13:20,218 --> 00:13:24,505
then tried to use it
to take over Hessington Oil.

364
00:13:31,807 --> 00:13:33,252
All right,
so how do we celebrate?

365
00:13:33,277 --> 00:13:34,523
Celebrate what?

366
00:13:34,966 --> 00:13:36,333
Our first case
as a couple.

367
00:13:36,418 --> 00:13:37,668
We should go
to that French place you like,

368
00:13:37,752 --> 00:13:39,053
get a bottle of wine,

369
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,621
a couple of things that
I don't know how to pronounce,

370
00:13:40,672 --> 00:13:42,590
and then go back
to my place and celebrate.

371
00:13:42,641 --> 00:13:44,058
That's what we're calling it
these days?

372
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:46,227
Well, "victory sex"
seemed less romantic.

373
00:13:46,294 --> 00:13:47,394
- Well, I can't tonight.
- Why not?

374
00:13:47,462 --> 00:13:49,180
I have dinner
with my parents.

375
00:13:49,264 --> 00:13:50,981
Maybe I could
come with you.

376
00:13:51,066 --> 00:13:52,733
Um...Yeah, I--

377
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,435
Unless you don't
want me there.

378
00:13:54,486 --> 00:13:56,487
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, wait a minute.

379
00:13:56,571 --> 00:13:58,155
You don't want me there.

380
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,607
Of course I do.

381
00:13:59,658 --> 00:14:00,807
You don't look
like you do.

382
00:14:00,859 --> 00:14:02,026
Is it because I'm white?

383
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:03,671
- That's not funny.
- Empirically it is.

384
00:14:03,745 --> 00:14:05,446
No, it's not, and you're
acting like it's nothing.

385
00:14:05,497 --> 00:14:07,414
Rachel, come on, look,
I know it's something,

386
00:14:07,482 --> 00:14:09,002
but you're acting
like it's everything.

387
00:14:09,084 --> 00:14:10,784
It is everything.

388
00:14:10,835 --> 00:14:12,086
Wait a second.

389
00:14:12,153 --> 00:14:15,206
Do you not want me to meet them
tonight or at all?

390
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:17,708
I don't want them
to find out your secret.

391
00:14:17,792 --> 00:14:19,877
They're not
gonna find out.

392
00:14:19,961 --> 00:14:22,012
- How do you know that?
- Because no one finds out.

393
00:14:22,097 --> 00:14:25,049
You, Donna, Jessica,
you were all told.

394
00:14:25,133 --> 00:14:27,518
Besides, I met your dad.
He didn't figure it out.

395
00:14:27,602 --> 00:14:28,686
He met you as someone
that he wouldn't give

396
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:30,187
a second thought to,
Mike.

397
00:14:30,272 --> 00:14:32,189
As my boyfriend,
he is going to put you

398
00:14:32,274 --> 00:14:33,440
under the microscope.

399
00:14:33,508 --> 00:14:35,226
- I can pass inspection.
- Well, what about me?

400
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:37,177
Because you might be experienced
at lying to the world,

401
00:14:37,229 --> 00:14:38,696
but I'm not.

402
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:41,148
And it's not the world,
it's my family.

403
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:43,234
Okay, Rachel, you and I
have told each other

404
00:14:43,318 --> 00:14:44,868
that we love
each other, right?

405
00:14:44,953 --> 00:14:47,738
Did we mean that
or not?

406
00:14:47,822 --> 00:14:49,573
If we did,
then at some point,

407
00:14:49,658 --> 00:14:52,042
I am gonna have to meet
your parents.

408
00:14:52,127 --> 00:14:55,462
Interview's in 20 minutes.
We should go.

409
00:15:02,337 --> 00:15:03,420
Make yourself at home.

410
00:15:03,505 --> 00:15:06,840
I wanted to talk to you
in here.

411
00:15:06,891 --> 00:15:09,209
- Is this about your--
- No, no.

412
00:15:09,261 --> 00:15:12,146
You don't even know
what I was gonna say.

413
00:15:16,551 --> 00:15:18,152
How'd it go
with Gianopolous?

414
00:15:18,219 --> 00:15:20,053
Well,
he's not a pushover,

415
00:15:20,105 --> 00:15:21,722
but I think we have
a good plan.

416
00:15:21,773 --> 00:15:23,407
- So it went well?
- Yeah, it went well.

417
00:15:23,491 --> 00:15:24,692
And since when are you--

418
00:15:24,743 --> 00:15:27,778
I'm sleeping with Stephen.

419
00:15:27,862 --> 00:15:29,947
I can see that.

420
00:15:30,031 --> 00:15:31,231
You can see that?

421
00:15:31,283 --> 00:15:33,584
That's all you have
to say?

422
00:15:33,668 --> 00:15:35,369
Do you want me
to say more?

423
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:37,254
It depends
on what you would say.

424
00:15:37,339 --> 00:15:39,790
I'd say, "when?"

425
00:15:39,874 --> 00:15:41,342
Three days ago.

426
00:15:41,409 --> 00:15:43,127
Why didn't
you tell me before?

427
00:15:43,211 --> 00:15:44,628
I was going to,
but you got so upset

428
00:15:44,713 --> 00:15:46,079
when you thought
I was working for him.

429
00:15:46,131 --> 00:15:48,048
Because you work for me.

430
00:15:48,099 --> 00:15:50,517
Well, I'm not working
for him.

431
00:15:50,585 --> 00:15:52,252
Good.

432
00:15:53,972 --> 00:15:55,589
So you're not upset.

433
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:56,940
No.

434
00:15:57,025 --> 00:15:59,092
What you're doing with him
is personal.

435
00:15:59,144 --> 00:16:01,094
- And this isn't?
- Donna,

436
00:16:01,146 --> 00:16:03,263
I don't wanna make this a thing.
I don't either.

437
00:16:03,315 --> 00:16:05,199
I just want to make sure
that it doesn't become a thing.

438
00:16:05,266 --> 00:16:08,035
It won't as long as you
don't let that affect this.

439
00:16:08,102 --> 00:16:11,121
Okay.

440
00:16:11,206 --> 00:16:13,157
Miss Clark, do you know
Graham Stenton well?

441
00:16:13,241 --> 00:16:14,608
We've worked together
for a while.

442
00:16:14,659 --> 00:16:16,327
And you handle the books
for his accounts,

443
00:16:16,411 --> 00:16:17,411
is that right?

444
00:16:17,462 --> 00:16:18,796
Yes, that's right.

445
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,631
We just need to know
when exactly you became aware

446
00:16:20,715 --> 00:16:24,385
that Mr. Stenton
was manipulating the numbers.

447
00:16:24,452 --> 00:16:27,838
I don't believe he was.

448
00:16:27,922 --> 00:16:29,623
Well,
the auditors disagree.

449
00:16:29,674 --> 00:16:31,725
Well, I disagree with them.
Graham's a good person.

450
00:16:31,793 --> 00:16:34,034
I'm sure Bernie Madoff's
friends all said the same thing.

451
00:16:34,062 --> 00:16:35,312
That isn't fair.

452
00:16:35,397 --> 00:16:36,513
And Graham
isn't the only person

453
00:16:36,598 --> 00:16:37,878
who had access
to those accounts.

454
00:16:37,932 --> 00:16:39,966
Mr. Oxnard, Mr. Dipetro,

455
00:16:40,018 --> 00:16:42,853
several individuals
from the controller's office.

456
00:16:42,937 --> 00:16:44,805
I just have
one question for you.

457
00:16:44,856 --> 00:16:47,741
How long have you
been sleeping with him?

458
00:16:47,809 --> 00:16:49,193
What?

459
00:16:49,277 --> 00:16:52,329
You smiled when you started
talking about him.

460
00:16:52,414 --> 00:16:54,164
You called him "Graham."

461
00:16:54,249 --> 00:16:56,784
You've referred to everyone else
as "mister" or "individual."

462
00:16:56,835 --> 00:16:59,152
And when my colleague asked
you about sleeping with him,

463
00:16:59,204 --> 00:17:02,122
you didn't seem offended,
you seemed caught.

464
00:17:02,173 --> 00:17:03,374
I had nothing
to do with this.

465
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:04,925
That doesn't mean
you don't know anything.

466
00:17:04,992 --> 00:17:07,594
Look, Miss Clark, we're trying
to make this go away quietly,

467
00:17:07,662 --> 00:17:09,546
but if we can't, we're gonna
make it go away loudly,

468
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:11,432
which means putting you
on the stand.

469
00:17:11,499 --> 00:17:13,500
Beth, you won't be able
to take the fifth

470
00:17:13,551 --> 00:17:15,669
because you won't be
testifying against yourself.

471
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,221
And if you lie on the stand,
that's perjury.

472
00:17:17,305 --> 00:17:19,673
Look, if you really
want to protect him,

473
00:17:19,724 --> 00:17:22,342
just get him to give us
the money back now,

474
00:17:22,394 --> 00:17:25,562
while we can still
take care of this quietly.

475
00:17:28,349 --> 00:17:30,200
I can't.

476
00:17:30,285 --> 00:17:31,685
That's it,
I'm calling the D.A.

477
00:17:31,736 --> 00:17:33,237
I think we should give her
some time to think about it.

478
00:17:33,321 --> 00:17:36,240
- I don't think so.
- Mike, it's a hard decision.

479
00:17:38,877 --> 00:17:42,379
Fine.
She has until tomorrow.

480
00:17:53,508 --> 00:17:55,843
Oh, what's going on?
Nothing.

481
00:17:55,894 --> 00:17:58,262
Simon.

482
00:17:58,346 --> 00:18:01,398
Mr. Nesbitt
gave us all gifts.

483
00:18:01,483 --> 00:18:03,434
And they're funny?

484
00:18:03,518 --> 00:18:05,819
I think
they're meant to be.

485
00:18:05,887 --> 00:18:08,155
Well, you know,
he has trouble connecting,

486
00:18:08,222 --> 00:18:10,357
but he's making an effort.

487
00:18:10,408 --> 00:18:13,277
Maybe he took
my words to heart.

488
00:18:15,947 --> 00:18:18,081
What'd you say to him?

489
00:18:20,919 --> 00:18:24,705
Ah.
Turned out quite well.

490
00:18:24,756 --> 00:18:27,257
- You crossed a line.
- I did no such thing.

491
00:18:27,342 --> 00:18:29,042
You took a private feud,
and you made it public.

492
00:18:29,093 --> 00:18:31,295
After you tried
to undermine my authority.

493
00:18:31,379 --> 00:18:32,713
Because you don't know
what you're doing.

494
00:18:32,764 --> 00:18:34,431
I knew what I was doing
when I took them from you

495
00:18:34,516 --> 00:18:35,516
like biscuits
from a schoolboy.

496
00:18:35,583 --> 00:18:37,050
All right,
you son of a bitch.

497
00:18:37,101 --> 00:18:40,637
You better get yourself ready,
'cause I'm about to kick--

498
00:18:40,722 --> 00:18:43,106
I know it's generally
against regulations,

499
00:18:43,191 --> 00:18:44,691
but her nanny
fell ill, and--

500
00:18:44,759 --> 00:18:46,643
No, no, no, no.
Say no more.

501
00:18:46,728 --> 00:18:48,312
A father's love
knows no rule.

502
00:18:48,396 --> 00:18:49,530
I didn't know
you were a cat man.

503
00:18:49,597 --> 00:18:50,981
Do I have brains
in my head?

504
00:18:51,065 --> 00:18:52,225
Do I have a heart
in my chest?

505
00:18:52,266 --> 00:18:53,426
Who is
this stunning creature?

506
00:18:53,434 --> 00:18:55,202
Her moniker
is "Mikado."

507
00:18:55,269 --> 00:18:56,737
So does that mean
she enjoys--

508
00:18:56,788 --> 00:18:59,490
Yes, whenever we travel,
I make sure she has

509
00:18:59,574 --> 00:19:01,775
some Gilbert and Sullivan
playing in her sherpa.

510
00:19:01,826 --> 00:19:03,627
Uh, do be careful,
she doesn't normally like--

511
00:19:06,047 --> 00:19:07,714
My God.

512
00:19:07,782 --> 00:19:09,166
What?
Oh.

513
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:10,617
Does she prefer
the left side?

514
00:19:10,668 --> 00:19:12,386
She doesn't normally
let anyone touch her except me.

515
00:19:12,453 --> 00:19:17,224
I happen to have a way with
those of the feline persuasion.

516
00:19:17,291 --> 00:19:18,959
Do you have any cream?

517
00:19:25,984 --> 00:19:29,236
You wanted to see me?

518
00:19:29,303 --> 00:19:31,772
Yes.
I had some free time.

519
00:19:31,823 --> 00:19:33,974
Oakwood Foods canceled
our 10:00 a.m. meeting,

520
00:19:34,025 --> 00:19:38,579
as did Omni Holdings at noon
and Dunbar Securities at 4:00.

521
00:19:38,646 --> 00:19:40,914
Sounds like you need
to work on your people skills.

522
00:19:40,982 --> 00:19:43,033
You need to work
on your people skills.

523
00:19:43,117 --> 00:19:45,986
Those meetings were canceled
because we just got fired.

524
00:19:46,037 --> 00:19:47,671
And why is that
my fault?

525
00:19:47,755 --> 00:19:49,823
They're not my clients.
I've never even met them.

526
00:19:49,874 --> 00:19:51,825
No, but evidently,

527
00:19:51,876 --> 00:19:54,160
you have met
their new owner,

528
00:19:54,212 --> 00:19:56,513
Tony Gianopolous,
who bought them

529
00:19:56,598 --> 00:19:58,599
for the sole purpose
of firing us.

530
00:19:58,666 --> 00:19:59,766
Good.

531
00:19:59,834 --> 00:20:01,518
I pissed him off.
That means it's working.

532
00:20:01,603 --> 00:20:03,670
Oh, you mean
that plan of yours

533
00:20:03,721 --> 00:20:05,042
you didn't think
to tell me about.

534
00:20:05,056 --> 00:20:06,696
Oh, I thought about it,
and then I thought

535
00:20:06,724 --> 00:20:08,725
you'd just go behind my back
and undo it.

536
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:11,445
So you went behind my back
and went to Stephen Huntley.

537
00:20:11,512 --> 00:20:13,346
I told you,
I trust him.

538
00:20:13,398 --> 00:20:15,616
Well,
you're the one

539
00:20:15,683 --> 00:20:17,618
who likes to throw
Darby's name around.

540
00:20:17,685 --> 00:20:20,954
So why don't
you and Stephen call him

541
00:20:21,022 --> 00:20:23,790
and let him know that
you single-handedly lost us

542
00:20:23,858 --> 00:20:25,358
more business in a day

543
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:27,077
than you've ever gotten
in a month.

544
00:20:27,161 --> 00:20:29,195
And feel free
to use my phone.

545
00:20:29,247 --> 00:20:30,747
Since you freed up
my afternoon,

546
00:20:30,832 --> 00:20:32,583
I'm taking
the rest of the day off.

547
00:20:33,968 --> 00:20:35,586
Did you see the look
on her face?

548
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:38,872
Are you kidding?
We put that look on her face.

549
00:20:38,923 --> 00:20:41,091
- Ah.
- Good cop, bad cop.

550
00:20:41,175 --> 00:20:44,311
- Uh, Mike, Harvey.
- So I guess it is a thing.

551
00:20:44,378 --> 00:20:46,563
So we should have the money
back by this weekend,

552
00:20:46,648 --> 00:20:47,931
and then,
we can celebrate.

553
00:20:48,016 --> 00:20:50,601
I was thinking that we could
celebrate tonight...

554
00:20:50,685 --> 00:20:53,604
After dinner
with my parents.

555
00:20:53,688 --> 00:20:55,322
Do you want me to come?

556
00:20:55,389 --> 00:20:58,075
That look
on Beth's face,

557
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:01,912
it didn't just say
that they slept together.

558
00:21:01,996 --> 00:21:03,113
She loves him.

559
00:21:03,197 --> 00:21:08,118
I told you I love you,
and I meant it.

560
00:21:08,202 --> 00:21:11,672
That's not something
I want to hide from my family.

561
00:21:15,593 --> 00:21:17,577
I actually made plans,
so I'm not gonna be able to--

562
00:21:17,629 --> 00:21:18,745
Bad joke?

563
00:21:18,796 --> 00:21:19,913
- No, terrible timing.
- Bad timing.

564
00:21:19,964 --> 00:21:21,915
Okay.
I guessed.

565
00:21:27,472 --> 00:21:29,690
I need your help
with Gianopolous.

566
00:21:29,757 --> 00:21:31,608
Relax,
if he's making another run

567
00:21:31,693 --> 00:21:33,477
at Hessington Oil,
that's not gonna happen.

568
00:21:33,561 --> 00:21:36,146
- Well, how can you know that?
- Because you just restructured,

569
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:37,981
and he can't force
another takeover vote

570
00:21:38,066 --> 00:21:39,316
for at least six months.

571
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,868
Then why is he driving
my stock into the ground?

572
00:21:41,936 --> 00:21:44,905
- What?
- He's been dumping it all day.

573
00:21:44,956 --> 00:21:47,457
I'll take care of it.

574
00:21:47,542 --> 00:21:50,110
What did you do?

575
00:21:50,161 --> 00:21:51,461
We picked a fight
with him.

576
00:21:51,546 --> 00:21:54,047
We've just finished
a fight with him

577
00:21:54,115 --> 00:21:56,216
that ended with me
losing control of my company,

578
00:21:56,283 --> 00:21:58,335
so why in God's name
would you pick another?

579
00:21:58,419 --> 00:22:01,121
To get you out of these
murder charges once and for all,

580
00:22:01,172 --> 00:22:02,506
and after I do,

581
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:04,841
we'll figure out a way
to get you back in charge.

582
00:22:04,926 --> 00:22:06,593
You see that you do,

583
00:22:06,644 --> 00:22:09,563
because I would rather rot
in a cell

584
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:12,298
than let that man
take over my company.

585
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,984
So I tell her, it's not
my fault she might be early.

586
00:22:20,427 --> 00:22:21,932
Man, I'm in the middle
of closing arguments.

587
00:22:21,933 --> 00:22:24,413
And I tell him that if he's
not with me when she arrives,

588
00:22:24,414 --> 00:22:26,249
the next case he'll try
is his own murder.

589
00:22:26,316 --> 00:22:27,750
Then I walk in the room,

590
00:22:27,818 --> 00:22:29,318
and she sees that I was right
outside the door the whole time.

591
00:22:29,369 --> 00:22:30,319
I was not amused.

592
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:31,671
You weren't amused?

593
00:22:31,755 --> 00:22:33,206
You actually didn't go
into labor for another week.

594
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:34,707
I lost that case.

595
00:22:34,792 --> 00:22:36,342
Robert, you've had
enough potatoes.

596
00:22:36,426 --> 00:22:38,594
She's trying to make me eat
that foodie bullshit.

597
00:22:38,662 --> 00:22:40,046
Oh, I find that
hard to believe.

598
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:41,214
Made me a smoothie
this morning,

599
00:22:41,298 --> 00:22:43,266
I got all excited.
It was green.

600
00:22:43,333 --> 00:22:44,300
That's what healthy
looks like.

601
00:22:44,351 --> 00:22:45,351
Thank you, Rachel.

602
00:22:45,435 --> 00:22:46,502
- You're not alone.
- What was that?

603
00:22:46,553 --> 00:22:47,937
I'm bonding
with your father here.

604
00:22:48,004 --> 00:22:49,338
- Speaking of which--
- Robert.

605
00:22:49,389 --> 00:22:51,390
What? You don't even know
what I'm gonna say.

606
00:22:51,475 --> 00:22:52,975
I know the next six things
you're gonna say,

607
00:22:53,026 --> 00:22:54,844
and you're not gonna say them,
because I told you,

608
00:22:54,895 --> 00:22:56,779
Rachel doesn't want you
grilling this poor young man.

609
00:22:56,847 --> 00:22:57,980
- What?
- Mom.

610
00:22:58,031 --> 00:22:59,365
You're not taking it easy
on me, are you?

611
00:22:59,449 --> 00:23:00,850
- A little.
- You told me to rein him in.

612
00:23:00,901 --> 00:23:02,141
I also told you
not to tell him.

613
00:23:02,152 --> 00:23:03,569
That's not how we do things
in this family.

614
00:23:03,654 --> 00:23:04,954
I'm not keeping things
from your father.

615
00:23:05,021 --> 00:23:06,656
You kept it from me
when you scratched the car.

616
00:23:06,707 --> 00:23:07,707
Robert,
eat your potatoes.

617
00:23:07,741 --> 00:23:09,375
What's so funny?

618
00:23:09,459 --> 00:23:11,043
She's not consistent
with the potatoes.

619
00:23:11,128 --> 00:23:12,528
She's not consistent
with anything.

620
00:23:12,579 --> 00:23:14,196
Okay, you're not getting
any potatoes.

621
00:23:14,248 --> 00:23:16,215
Now what's so funny?

622
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:18,050
Uh, I see
where she gets it from.

623
00:23:18,135 --> 00:23:20,803
Gets what?

624
00:23:20,871 --> 00:23:22,255
You better shut up
and eat your potatoes.

625
00:23:22,339 --> 00:23:24,423
Mmhmm.

626
00:23:28,378 --> 00:23:31,848
She actually said
she'd prefer to rot in a cell?

627
00:23:31,899 --> 00:23:33,766
Well, you've gotta give her
credit for that.

628
00:23:33,851 --> 00:23:36,218
You do,
and she's right.

629
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:38,237
It's not making any sense.

630
00:23:38,322 --> 00:23:41,107
If he's not making a run,
why is he dumping her shares?

631
00:23:41,191 --> 00:23:43,559
- He's reacting.
- He's overreacting.

632
00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:46,061
He may have money to burn,
but this isn't

633
00:23:46,113 --> 00:23:48,164
tens of thousands,
it's tens of millions.

634
00:23:48,231 --> 00:23:49,582
It's completely
out of proportion.

635
00:23:49,666 --> 00:23:52,168
- Not exactly.
- What are you talking about?

636
00:23:52,235 --> 00:23:55,621
I subpoenaed his daughter.

637
00:23:55,706 --> 00:23:57,373
You what?

638
00:23:57,424 --> 00:24:00,075
He fired our client,
so I struck back.

639
00:24:00,127 --> 00:24:02,511
And you didn't think
to run that by me?

640
00:24:02,579 --> 00:24:04,013
No, I didn't think
you'd say no.

641
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,932
I'd say no
because I'm not an idiot.

642
00:24:06,016 --> 00:24:07,416
Idiot?

643
00:24:07,467 --> 00:24:08,801
We need this man
to help us.

644
00:24:08,886 --> 00:24:10,636
You just made him
a permanent enemy.

645
00:24:10,721 --> 00:24:12,555
Me?
We did this together.

646
00:24:12,606 --> 00:24:14,857
- Don't put this on me.
- You're putting it on me.

647
00:24:14,925 --> 00:24:16,225
Because you
goddamn did it!

648
00:24:16,276 --> 00:24:18,356
You were going to go after him
no matter what I said.

649
00:24:18,395 --> 00:24:19,362
I attacked his business.

650
00:24:19,429 --> 00:24:20,980
You went after his family.

651
00:24:21,064 --> 00:24:23,699
Don't tell me you've never
done the same thing,

652
00:24:23,767 --> 00:24:25,100
and what's the difference
between me doing it,

653
00:24:25,152 --> 00:24:27,453
other than
the fact that--

654
00:24:27,537 --> 00:24:29,989
ah.

655
00:24:30,073 --> 00:24:32,291
I see.

656
00:24:32,376 --> 00:24:35,294
This isn't about me getting
personal with Gianopolous.

657
00:24:35,379 --> 00:24:38,714
This is about me
getting personal with Donna.

658
00:24:40,951 --> 00:24:42,952
I'm gonna pretend
you didn't just say that.

659
00:24:43,003 --> 00:24:45,338
Is that
because she's listening?

660
00:24:45,422 --> 00:24:47,173
I don't give a shit
if she hears it or not.

661
00:24:47,257 --> 00:24:49,141
You crossed a line
with Gianopolous,

662
00:24:49,226 --> 00:24:51,811
and you just crossed
another one with me.

663
00:24:51,895 --> 00:24:54,397
You know, you've had it
in for me from the start.

664
00:24:54,464 --> 00:24:56,682
And you've only been
with Donna for three days,

665
00:24:56,767 --> 00:24:58,300
that should tell you
something.

666
00:24:58,352 --> 00:25:00,269
Let me spell it out
for you, okay?

667
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,688
You don't work my case
without me,

668
00:25:02,773 --> 00:25:05,093
and since you seem to be having
trouble understanding that,

669
00:25:05,108 --> 00:25:06,275
you don't work my case
at all.

670
00:25:06,326 --> 00:25:09,278
Now get out of my office.

671
00:25:21,792 --> 00:25:24,660
- So, Michael--
- Mike.

672
00:25:24,711 --> 00:25:27,046
So now you're gonna tell me
what to call you?

673
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:29,832
No, I-I--it's--
people usually call me--

674
00:25:29,883 --> 00:25:31,017
I'm just messing
with you.

675
00:25:33,503 --> 00:25:36,439
So where are you from?
I grew up in Brooklyn.

676
00:25:36,506 --> 00:25:38,891
Brothers, sisters?

677
00:25:38,976 --> 00:25:40,443
Only child.

678
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:42,344
Parents still there?

679
00:25:42,396 --> 00:25:44,030
They both died
when I was a kid.

680
00:25:44,114 --> 00:25:47,516
Nah,
you're messing with me.

681
00:25:53,573 --> 00:25:56,492
I just asked an orphan
about his dead parents

682
00:25:56,543 --> 00:26:00,246
and made a joke about it,
didn't I?

683
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:01,697
Does he like apple
or blueberry?

684
00:26:01,748 --> 00:26:03,215
Mom, shh, I'm trying to hear
what they're saying.

685
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:06,052
Rachel, relax,
he can handle your father.

686
00:26:06,136 --> 00:26:07,586
How do you know?

687
00:26:07,671 --> 00:26:09,338
Because you wouldn't have
brought him here if he couldn't.

688
00:26:09,389 --> 00:26:13,175
Besides, what are you so afraid
they're gonna say?

689
00:26:13,226 --> 00:26:15,394
You're right.
Nothing.

690
00:26:15,479 --> 00:26:18,731
Honey, what is it?

691
00:26:22,652 --> 00:26:25,354
You don't have
to tell me.

692
00:26:25,405 --> 00:26:27,690
But just tell me this,

693
00:26:27,741 --> 00:26:30,609
do you love him?

694
00:26:32,662 --> 00:26:35,748
As long as he hasn't killed
someone, it'll all work out.

695
00:26:37,451 --> 00:26:41,504
Come on.

696
00:26:47,094 --> 00:26:49,211
I thought you were taking
the day off.

697
00:26:49,262 --> 00:26:51,013
That was the day,
this is the night,

698
00:26:51,081 --> 00:26:52,681
and my name is
still on the door.

699
00:26:52,749 --> 00:26:55,634
It is.

700
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:59,722
- What do you want, Harvey?
- You were right.

701
00:26:59,773 --> 00:27:01,524
We've had a lot
of disagreements lately.

702
00:27:01,591 --> 00:27:02,925
Which one
are you referring to?

703
00:27:02,976 --> 00:27:05,478
I'm not entirely sure
Stephen Huntley's judgment

704
00:27:05,562 --> 00:27:06,929
is better than yours.

705
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:09,315
He went behind my back.

706
00:27:09,399 --> 00:27:11,067
Going behind someone's back

707
00:27:11,118 --> 00:27:13,268
doesn't seem like something
you have a problem with.

708
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:16,822
Maybe, but he hit Gianopolous
below the belt,

709
00:27:16,907 --> 00:27:18,407
and now we have
a problem.

710
00:27:18,458 --> 00:27:20,493
<i>We</i> have a problem?

711
00:27:20,577 --> 00:27:22,578
You said your name
was still on the door.

712
00:27:22,629 --> 00:27:25,548
I'm coming to you
for help.

713
00:27:29,086 --> 00:27:30,886
What's our problem?

714
00:27:30,954 --> 00:27:33,339
He's dumping
Hessington Oil shares

715
00:27:33,423 --> 00:27:36,291
just to drive her
into the ground.

716
00:27:43,466 --> 00:27:46,468
Well,
if we can come together,

717
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:47,853
maybe they
can come together.

718
00:27:47,938 --> 00:27:50,156
- I'm listening.
- Tony Gianopolous

719
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:54,777
wants to own
Hessington Oil.

720
00:27:54,828 --> 00:27:56,579
Ava wants to control it.

721
00:27:56,646 --> 00:27:59,532
She sells him her shares,

722
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:01,083
he gives her
the voting rights.

723
00:28:01,151 --> 00:28:03,335
And he gives up
Cameron Dennis.

724
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:07,039
They get what they want,
and so do we.

725
00:28:07,124 --> 00:28:08,657
You think
he'll still go for it?

726
00:28:08,708 --> 00:28:12,044
He'll know we're coming to him
because he won.

727
00:28:12,129 --> 00:28:14,046
He won't be the problem.

728
00:28:14,131 --> 00:28:15,548
Ava said she'd rather rot

729
00:28:15,632 --> 00:28:18,467
than see him
take over her company.

730
00:28:18,518 --> 00:28:20,386
I'll take care of Ava.

731
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:24,023
Look, it seems like
you two get along,

732
00:28:24,107 --> 00:28:26,508
and I like you.

733
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:29,562
So I'm gonna
ask you this straight.

734
00:28:29,646 --> 00:28:31,480
She's worked her ass off
to become a lawyer.

735
00:28:31,531 --> 00:28:32,848
I know.

736
00:28:32,899 --> 00:28:34,779
Well, I don't want anything
to stand in her way.

737
00:28:34,784 --> 00:28:36,018
I would never do that.

738
00:28:36,069 --> 00:28:38,787
So what happens
when she gets into Stanford?

739
00:28:42,292 --> 00:28:45,044
You didn't know
she applied there.

740
00:28:47,363 --> 00:28:50,199
Looks like you two
have something to talk about.

741
00:28:57,721 --> 00:28:59,121
You're awfully
quiet this morning.

742
00:28:59,192 --> 00:29:00,476
- Just tired.
- Still?

743
00:29:00,527 --> 00:29:02,164
I mean, you went home
right after dinner last night.

744
00:29:02,165 --> 00:29:04,333
Yeah,
trouble sleeping.

745
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:07,202
Is something wrong?

746
00:29:07,254 --> 00:29:09,088
Hey, who the hell
do you think you are?

747
00:29:09,172 --> 00:29:10,806
Mr. Stenton, I guess
you got our message.

748
00:29:10,874 --> 00:29:13,309
Oh, I did,
and now I've got one for you.

749
00:29:13,376 --> 00:29:16,061
Beth and I got married
this morning.

750
00:29:16,146 --> 00:29:17,713
You married a woman
to protect yourself?

751
00:29:17,764 --> 00:29:19,265
I married her
because I love her.

752
00:29:19,349 --> 00:29:20,566
But you did it
to make any conversation

753
00:29:20,650 --> 00:29:22,234
that the two of you had
privileged.

754
00:29:22,319 --> 00:29:23,986
Says the lawyer
who threatened her.

755
00:29:24,053 --> 00:29:26,739
Well, now you take this
to trial, she won't testify.

756
00:29:26,823 --> 00:29:28,941
Well, it's too bad
spousal privilege

757
00:29:29,025 --> 00:29:30,576
doesn't apply
to bullshit marriages.

758
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:32,278
Yeah, good luck
arguing that.

759
00:29:32,362 --> 00:29:34,603
We offered the two of you
a chance to give back the money

760
00:29:34,614 --> 00:29:36,365
and walk away, but
after we prove you did this--

761
00:29:36,416 --> 00:29:38,250
Oh, you can't prove
I did a thing.

762
00:29:38,335 --> 00:29:41,587
And now, you can't force her
to prove it for you either.

763
00:29:49,379 --> 00:29:51,413
You never returned my call
last night.

764
00:29:51,465 --> 00:29:52,932
Well, what could be different
about last night

765
00:29:53,016 --> 00:29:55,768
than the night before?
Hmm?

766
00:29:55,852 --> 00:29:57,770
Maybe the fact
that you went to Harvey

767
00:29:57,854 --> 00:29:59,972
and you threw me
in his face.

768
00:30:00,056 --> 00:30:03,091
Um, I was just telling it
how it was.

769
00:30:03,143 --> 00:30:04,944
He's already
got it in for us anyway.

770
00:30:05,028 --> 00:30:08,481
Well, that's my business
with him, not yours.

771
00:30:08,565 --> 00:30:11,200
You're right.
I'm sorry.

772
00:30:11,267 --> 00:30:14,653
I never wanted to make things
awkward for you and Harvey.

773
00:30:14,738 --> 00:30:19,041
You made things awkward
for you and me.

774
00:30:19,108 --> 00:30:21,126
- Donna--
- I like you, Stephen,

775
00:30:21,211 --> 00:30:23,012
and I have enjoyed
our short-term arrangement,

776
00:30:23,046 --> 00:30:24,830
but I don't enjoy
complications.

777
00:30:24,915 --> 00:30:28,384
I don't either,
but it seems we have one.

778
00:30:28,451 --> 00:30:32,721
Now, I'm affected by you
more than I thought,

779
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:35,724
and I'm finding I'd like
to extend our term.

780
00:30:38,595 --> 00:30:42,631
I'll take your offer
under advisement.

781
00:30:51,691 --> 00:30:54,827
I am not selling my shares
to that man.

782
00:30:54,911 --> 00:30:56,579
I don't know you
that well, Ava,

783
00:30:56,646 --> 00:30:58,313
and I won't pretend
that I do,

784
00:30:58,365 --> 00:30:59,915
but we do have something
in common.

785
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:01,083
What is that?

786
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:02,952
I merged
with Edward Darby

787
00:31:03,003 --> 00:31:04,787
to save my firm
from being hijacked

788
00:31:04,838 --> 00:31:06,589
by my piece of shit
ex-partner.

789
00:31:06,656 --> 00:31:09,174
And what exactly
does that give us in common?

790
00:31:09,259 --> 00:31:11,877
I know what it's like
to prefer rotting in the ground

791
00:31:11,962 --> 00:31:15,548
than letting my enemy
take what's mine.

792
00:31:15,632 --> 00:31:17,349
I said,
"rotting in a cell."

793
00:31:17,434 --> 00:31:19,051
I wasn't
up on murder charges.

794
00:31:19,135 --> 00:31:20,502
And you'd rather
have died?

795
00:31:20,554 --> 00:31:22,938
I was speaking metaphorically,
as I'm sure you were.

796
00:31:23,006 --> 00:31:24,723
Was I?

797
00:31:24,808 --> 00:31:27,192
You won't be able
to run your company from a cell.

798
00:31:27,277 --> 00:31:29,177
My point is,

799
00:31:29,229 --> 00:31:31,313
I didn't want to merge,

800
00:31:31,364 --> 00:31:34,233
but I did what I had to do
to keep my company mine.

801
00:31:34,317 --> 00:31:37,185
And how is that
working out for you?

802
00:31:37,237 --> 00:31:39,371
It has
its ups and downs,

803
00:31:39,456 --> 00:31:41,857
but I wouldn't be
standing here in front of you

804
00:31:41,908 --> 00:31:43,292
if I hadn't done it.

805
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:45,911
Not exactly
a ringing endorsement.

806
00:31:45,996 --> 00:31:48,330
Ava...

807
00:31:48,381 --> 00:31:51,533
Do this.
Get free of your murder charges.

808
00:31:51,585 --> 00:31:54,503
Nobody is saying we can't try

809
00:31:54,554 --> 00:31:58,474
to get you
out of this deal later.

810
00:31:58,541 --> 00:32:00,759
I don't care what it takes,
I'm not losing to that guy.

811
00:32:00,844 --> 00:32:02,595
We need to find a way
around spousal privilege.

812
00:32:02,679 --> 00:32:03,879
I don't see how we can.

813
00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:05,397
Stupid goddamn law.
Excuse me.

814
00:32:05,482 --> 00:32:07,733
It's not entirely stupid.

815
00:32:07,817 --> 00:32:09,435
Oh, what, so now,
you're on his side?

816
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:11,219
No, privilege exists
for a reason.

817
00:32:11,271 --> 00:32:12,387
You don't want
to have to worry

818
00:32:12,439 --> 00:32:13,322
about what you trust
your partner with.

819
00:32:13,389 --> 00:32:14,406
That's assuming your partner

820
00:32:14,491 --> 00:32:15,574
even trusts you
in the first place.

821
00:32:15,659 --> 00:32:17,059
What is that even
supposed to mean?

822
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:20,663
It means, when were you gonna
tell me you applied to Stanford?

823
00:32:29,956 --> 00:32:33,208
Okay, so that's why you've
barely said three words to me

824
00:32:33,259 --> 00:32:35,678
since last night.
My dad told you.

825
00:32:35,745 --> 00:32:38,026
No, no, he didn't tell me,
he asked me how I felt about it

826
00:32:38,048 --> 00:32:39,528
because he assumed I knew,
like I know

827
00:32:39,582 --> 00:32:41,550
about all the East Coast schools
that you applied to.

828
00:32:41,601 --> 00:32:42,685
- Mike--
- First you didn't want me

829
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:44,219
to meet your parents,
and now this?

830
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:45,754
Yeah, and I changed my mind
about you meeting my parents,

831
00:32:45,805 --> 00:32:48,273
which I'm now
beginning to regret.

832
00:32:48,358 --> 00:32:49,975
Oh, why, because I found out
you hid something from me?

833
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:51,460
Like you never
hid anything from me.

834
00:32:51,528 --> 00:32:53,479
I hid something from you,
it kept us apart.

835
00:32:53,563 --> 00:32:56,098
What brought us together
was me telling you everything.

836
00:32:56,149 --> 00:32:59,318
- I was going to tell you.
- When?

837
00:32:59,402 --> 00:33:01,937
Before I went,
on Friday.

838
00:33:05,625 --> 00:33:07,126
You're going there?

839
00:33:07,210 --> 00:33:09,411
I got an interview.
I'm sorry.

840
00:33:09,462 --> 00:33:10,713
I just didn't know
how to tell you, mi--

841
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:11,880
- I don't know, how about,
"hey, Mike,

842
00:33:11,948 --> 00:33:13,716
I might go to law school
3,000 miles away"?

843
00:33:13,783 --> 00:33:15,263
I don't even know
if I'm gonna get in,

844
00:33:15,284 --> 00:33:17,052
which is exactly why I didn't
want to have this conversation.

845
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,671
No, you didn't want to have it
because you might go there

846
00:33:18,755 --> 00:33:22,341
and you're too afraid
to say it.

847
00:33:22,425 --> 00:33:26,595
Okay.
I might want to go there.

848
00:33:26,646 --> 00:33:28,897
I've said it.

849
00:33:41,444 --> 00:33:43,078
You may enter.

850
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:46,148
I'm afraid I've got
a bit of a sticky wicket.

851
00:33:47,534 --> 00:33:48,951
That sounds uncomfortable.

852
00:33:49,002 --> 00:33:51,670
The Hong Kong office urgently
requires me for a few weeks.

853
00:33:51,755 --> 00:33:53,288
Normally,
I'd bring Mikado, but--

854
00:33:53,339 --> 00:33:54,707
Whoa, wait,
are you asking me to--

855
00:33:54,791 --> 00:33:56,542
I can't get her papers
in time.

856
00:33:56,626 --> 00:33:58,210
She'd be facing quarantine.

857
00:33:58,294 --> 00:33:59,327
She'd sooner die.

858
00:33:59,379 --> 00:34:01,496
You already
understand her so well.

859
00:34:01,548 --> 00:34:03,498
I do, yet a request
of this magnitude--

860
00:34:03,550 --> 00:34:07,102
No, you're probably right,
it's too much to ask.

861
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:10,889
I'm sure there is
a suitable luxury feline hotel.

862
00:34:10,974 --> 00:34:13,442
Don't play games, okay?
We both know there isn't.

863
00:34:13,509 --> 00:34:17,446
- So you'll do it?
- N--yes, can I have her?

864
00:34:17,513 --> 00:34:18,864
Do you have a minute?

865
00:34:18,948 --> 00:34:20,399
I don't really feel like
talking about us right now.

866
00:34:20,483 --> 00:34:22,868
It's not about that.
Our discussion gave me an idea.

867
00:34:22,952 --> 00:34:25,020
Our discussion?

868
00:34:25,071 --> 00:34:27,189
Can we please not fight
about what to call our fight?

869
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:28,457
What's the idea?

870
00:34:28,524 --> 00:34:30,042
We don't do good cop,
bad cop anymore.

871
00:34:30,126 --> 00:34:32,127
We do bad cop, bad cop.

872
00:34:32,195 --> 00:34:35,030
The way I'm feeling right now,
yeah, I can do bad cop.

873
00:34:37,884 --> 00:34:39,251
Since when
do you come out here?

874
00:34:39,335 --> 00:34:41,470
Since they added
Asiago cheese.

875
00:34:41,537 --> 00:34:44,506
Your reward of choice
for a job well done.

876
00:34:44,557 --> 00:34:45,891
You remember that story?

877
00:34:45,975 --> 00:34:48,093
First story you ever told me.
You think I'd forget?

878
00:34:48,178 --> 00:34:49,728
That wasn't
the point of the story.

879
00:34:49,813 --> 00:34:52,898
- I assume you got Ava to agree.
- Yes, I did.

880
00:34:52,982 --> 00:34:54,650
Should I be buying you
an Asiago bagel?

881
00:34:54,717 --> 00:34:56,902
Poppy seed.

882
00:34:56,986 --> 00:34:58,386
The "good news, bad news"
bagel.

883
00:34:58,438 --> 00:35:00,022
Gianopolous agreed
to the deal.

884
00:35:00,073 --> 00:35:01,223
He gave up
Cameron Dennis.

885
00:35:01,274 --> 00:35:02,574
What's the bad news?

886
00:35:02,659 --> 00:35:04,159
Cameron
protected himself.

887
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:06,745
He never explicitly told
Gianopolous about the tape

888
00:35:06,830 --> 00:35:08,413
and never actually
showed him the tape.

889
00:35:08,498 --> 00:35:10,999
So what's
the good news?

890
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:13,202
He never explicitly
said anything,

891
00:35:13,253 --> 00:35:18,257
but he left Gianopolous alone
in the room with that tape.

892
00:35:29,585 --> 00:35:31,414
Late night?

893
00:35:31,415 --> 00:35:33,533
No sleep at all.

894
00:35:33,617 --> 00:35:34,707
The ulcer?

895
00:35:34,708 --> 00:35:35,941
No, Nigel's cat.

896
00:35:35,993 --> 00:35:38,044
You slept at Nigel's?

897
00:35:38,111 --> 00:35:40,380
No, he's out of town.
I'm cat-sitting.

898
00:35:40,447 --> 00:35:42,548
Mikado won't drink her cream

899
00:35:42,616 --> 00:35:44,617
unless it's precisely
5.5 degrees celsius,

900
00:35:44,668 --> 00:35:46,748
she turned her nose up
at Bruno's origami collection,

901
00:35:46,754 --> 00:35:51,007
and she won't use her litter box
unless it's facing London.

902
00:35:51,091 --> 00:35:52,842
Hate that damn thing.

903
00:35:52,926 --> 00:35:54,560
You're loving every second
with her, aren't you?

904
00:35:54,628 --> 00:35:57,680
All 86,400 of them.

905
00:35:57,765 --> 00:36:01,567
By the way, you don't have
that glow today, Donna.

906
00:36:01,635 --> 00:36:03,069
You stop yoga?

907
00:36:03,136 --> 00:36:04,654
I took
a couple nights off.

908
00:36:04,738 --> 00:36:06,072
Is this
because of Harvey?

909
00:36:06,139 --> 00:36:07,473
'Cause I don't care
what he says, Donna,

910
00:36:07,524 --> 00:36:09,075
you can't let work
get in the way of that glow.

911
00:36:09,142 --> 00:36:12,362
You know what, Louis,
you're right.

912
00:36:12,446 --> 00:36:14,864
I'm gonna schedule
an extra long session tonight.

913
00:36:14,948 --> 00:36:17,817
Ooh, can I come?

914
00:36:25,092 --> 00:36:27,043
Harvey,
what are you doing here?

915
00:36:27,127 --> 00:36:28,878
I'm here to tell you
that you lost.

916
00:36:28,962 --> 00:36:30,880
I didn't lose.
I may not have much time,

917
00:36:30,964 --> 00:36:33,716
but I still got--
That tape?

918
00:36:33,801 --> 00:36:36,769
Not anymore,
unless you want to dispute

919
00:36:36,837 --> 00:36:38,671
Tony Gianopolous'
sworn statement

920
00:36:38,722 --> 00:36:41,674
that you left him alone
with it.

921
00:36:49,683 --> 00:36:51,701
I can fight this.

922
00:36:51,785 --> 00:36:52,906
Chain of custody
is something

923
00:36:52,986 --> 00:36:54,821
I know a little bit about,
thanks to you.

924
00:36:54,872 --> 00:36:56,239
That tape is gone,
and so are you.

925
00:36:56,323 --> 00:36:58,825
- I'm not going anywhere.
- Admit it, Cameron, I beat you.

926
00:36:58,876 --> 00:37:02,194
Save yourself the embarrassment,
and cancel this trial.

927
00:37:02,246 --> 00:37:04,213
If you think
I would ever do that,

928
00:37:04,298 --> 00:37:06,532
I taught you
even less than I thought.

929
00:37:06,583 --> 00:37:09,535
This case was 50/50.
All you did was make it 80/20.

930
00:37:09,586 --> 00:37:11,087
99 to 1.

931
00:37:11,171 --> 00:37:13,139
It could be a million to one
for all I care.

932
00:37:13,206 --> 00:37:16,592
We're in the ring, I'm still
standing, and this isn't done.

933
00:37:16,677 --> 00:37:20,146
Now get out of my face.
I got a trial to prepare for.

934
00:37:28,221 --> 00:37:30,072
- What do you want?
- This is a request

935
00:37:30,157 --> 00:37:31,824
for charges to be filed
against Graham Stenton

936
00:37:31,892 --> 00:37:33,392
for stealing $30 million.

937
00:37:33,444 --> 00:37:35,564
The penalty for which
is 15 years in a federal prison.

938
00:37:35,612 --> 00:37:36,729
If you had proof of that,
you wouldn't have

939
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:38,080
come after me
in the first place.

940
00:37:38,165 --> 00:37:39,732
We have proof that you knew
something was wrong

941
00:37:39,783 --> 00:37:41,400
and you didn't notify
your employer.

942
00:37:41,452 --> 00:37:42,735
Which is why
this is a request for charges

943
00:37:42,786 --> 00:37:45,421
to be filed against you
as an accessory after the fact.

944
00:37:45,506 --> 00:37:48,257
The penalty for which is
five years in a federal prison.

945
00:37:48,342 --> 00:37:50,927
But you can avoid that
by testifying against him.

946
00:37:51,011 --> 00:37:54,180
Even if I was willing to,
I can't.

947
00:37:54,247 --> 00:37:56,098
We're married.
He'd stop me from testifying.

948
00:37:56,183 --> 00:37:58,184
In New York,
not in Connecticut.

949
00:37:58,251 --> 00:37:59,685
Which is where the charges
will be filed.

950
00:37:59,753 --> 00:38:02,188
You're asking me
to turn against the man I love.

951
00:38:02,255 --> 00:38:03,806
Then go to jail
and trust him.

952
00:38:03,891 --> 00:38:06,359
I'm guessing he's not gonna
be there when you get out.

953
00:38:06,426 --> 00:38:09,278
Beth,
even if he waits for you,

954
00:38:09,363 --> 00:38:12,231
he did this, and the fear
of him getting caught

955
00:38:12,282 --> 00:38:14,283
is going to cast a shadow
over every moment

956
00:38:14,368 --> 00:38:18,454
of the rest of your life
together.

957
00:38:18,539 --> 00:38:21,457
He may not be able to see that,
but I know you can.

958
00:38:29,917 --> 00:38:33,469
I'll get you
the money back.

959
00:38:38,759 --> 00:38:40,393
What are you doing?

960
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:42,178
Just leaving a note.

961
00:38:42,262 --> 00:38:45,965
By the way,
congratulations.

962
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:47,400
I hear you got the tape
thrown out

963
00:38:47,467 --> 00:38:49,852
and Ava reinstated
as the CEO.

964
00:38:49,937 --> 00:38:52,238
- In spite of you.
- Yeah, I know.

965
00:38:52,305 --> 00:38:55,324
You went to Jessica
for help.

966
00:38:55,409 --> 00:38:57,527
- You have a problem with that?
- No.

967
00:38:57,611 --> 00:39:00,980
I just think it's ironic
that she doesn't realize

968
00:39:01,031 --> 00:39:04,316
she just helped me
dig her own grave.

969
00:39:09,456 --> 00:39:12,375
It's me.

970
00:39:17,598 --> 00:39:19,682
Money got wired
into the account.

971
00:39:19,766 --> 00:39:22,001
Congratulations.

972
00:39:22,052 --> 00:39:23,469
I don't think
she would've caved

973
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:26,355
if you hadn't broken script
and gone all good cop on me.

974
00:39:29,643 --> 00:39:30,977
Look, I'm sorry--
I'm sorry-

975
00:39:31,028 --> 00:39:32,979
Rachel--
No, Mike.

976
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:34,981
We're in a fight
because I made the mistake

977
00:39:35,032 --> 00:39:38,183
of not telling you that I was
considering going to Stanford,

978
00:39:38,235 --> 00:39:39,351
but we're really
in a fight

979
00:39:39,403 --> 00:39:41,854
because I'm considering
going to Stanford.

980
00:39:41,905 --> 00:39:45,791
What you said to Beth,
was that really about me?

981
00:39:45,859 --> 00:39:47,220
- Mike, come on.
- Because you said

982
00:39:47,244 --> 00:39:49,879
the fear of him getting caught
was gonna cast a shadow

983
00:39:49,963 --> 00:39:52,048
over every minute of the rest
of their life together.

984
00:39:52,132 --> 00:39:55,418
If you're asking
if it's occurred to me

985
00:39:55,502 --> 00:40:01,173
that going to Stanford
could be a fresh start...

986
00:40:01,224 --> 00:40:02,174
Yeah.

987
00:40:02,225 --> 00:40:04,143
It has,
but the truth is

988
00:40:04,210 --> 00:40:06,545
I may or may not
get into Yale or Columbia,

989
00:40:06,597 --> 00:40:08,598
and you were the one
that told me

990
00:40:08,682 --> 00:40:11,400
that it'd be stupid
if I didn't just cover my bases,

991
00:40:11,485 --> 00:40:15,321
so I just need to go
and see if I even get in or not.

992
00:40:15,388 --> 00:40:17,523
I get it.

993
00:40:17,574 --> 00:40:18,524
I get all of it.

994
00:40:18,575 --> 00:40:19,615
I just can't stop thinking

995
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:22,278
about what will happen
if you do.

996
00:40:25,732 --> 00:40:26,999
You came to the decision

997
00:40:27,067 --> 00:40:29,952
to let me in on your secret
on your own,

998
00:40:30,037 --> 00:40:33,873
and I just need you
to give me the freedom

999
00:40:33,924 --> 00:40:36,959
to come to this decision
on my own.

1000
00:40:39,596 --> 00:40:42,748
I'm not one
for sentimental gestures,

1001
00:40:42,799 --> 00:40:44,800
but I was thinking
about when Hardman came back

1002
00:40:44,885 --> 00:40:48,253
and you and I got into it.

1003
00:40:48,305 --> 00:40:50,272
You got me
my tea set back.

1004
00:40:50,357 --> 00:40:52,591
You here to thank me
for that?

1005
00:40:52,643 --> 00:40:55,761
I'm here with a gesture
of my own.

1006
00:41:02,119 --> 00:41:04,036
This isn't a tea set.

1007
00:41:04,104 --> 00:41:07,623
It's going up on the wall
tomorrow.

1008
00:41:07,708 --> 00:41:09,325
I asked for that
a while ago.

1009
00:41:09,409 --> 00:41:10,793
You said I wasn't ready.

1010
00:41:10,877 --> 00:41:12,828
I also said
I wasn't just going to slap

1011
00:41:12,913 --> 00:41:16,716
someone else's name up there
next to mine, but I did.

1012
00:41:16,783 --> 00:41:21,087
And now you regret it.

1013
00:41:21,138 --> 00:41:23,756
And you're playing chess
again.

1014
00:41:23,807 --> 00:41:25,424
What does that mean?

1015
00:41:25,475 --> 00:41:28,010
It means, I want to know
if this is a gesture

1016
00:41:28,095 --> 00:41:31,180
or if it's a move.

1017
00:41:31,264 --> 00:41:35,901
What it is,
is my way of showing you

1018
00:41:35,969 --> 00:41:39,304
that Darby's treating me
the same way I treated you,

1019
00:41:39,356 --> 00:41:42,525
and I understand
how you felt.

1020
00:41:42,609 --> 00:41:45,361
You don't like it,

1021
00:41:45,445 --> 00:41:50,116
and this is your way
of getting me on your side.

1022
00:41:50,167 --> 00:41:53,335
Harvey, I can't make you
believe me,

1023
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:55,955
but I don't want you
