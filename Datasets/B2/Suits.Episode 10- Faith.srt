They get mad at them.

183
00:07:31,885 --> 00:07:33,919

I'm mad at god.

But i came out here

Patron saint of orphans.

190

Away from my family.

You've been a great father.

I'm just hoping it's not too
late to make it up to marcus.

Anyway, that's my news.

What... what did you want
to talk about?

238
00:09:56,863 --> 00:09:58,730
- Nothing.
I met a girl.

239
00:09:58,732 --> 00:10:00,365
- Great.
What's her name?

240
00:10:00,367 --> 00:10:02,834
- Scottie.

241
00:10:02,836 --> 00:10:05,070
I'm just trying to figure out
the long distance thing.

00:10:05,072 --> 00:10:07,606

if she's the one,

You'll know, just like with
me and your mother.

244

- No, i didn't.

246
00:10:17,767 --> 00:10:19,784
- But you said that was the
night you decided to tell him.

247
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:21,870
- That was the night i decided.

248
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:23,955
- No, you said it as though
it was all one night.

249
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:27,959
- I told you it was
all one night

250
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:31,229
Because i'm so used to lying
whenever i tell this story.

My age...

252
00:10:32,332 --> 00:10:33,798
- Why do you lie?

253
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,967
- Because i was a grown man
when it happened,

254
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:37,202
And grown men keep their words

255
00:10:37,204 --> 00:10:39,037

they're gonna do something,

Not give in to weakness.

made you break your word.

00:10:43,276 --> 00:10:44,909
It was love for your father.

259
00:10:44,911 --> 00:10:47,078

everything two weeks later.

After you offered to make him
name partner?

268
00:11:05,098 --> 00:11:06,965
- Because i didn't offer
to make him name partner.

269
00:11:06,967 --> 00:11:08,333
I told him to resign.

270
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:09,367

271
00:11:09,369 --> 00:11:10,935

272
00:11:10,937 --> 00:11:12,871
It was your insane idea,

If you so much as tell me
the incorrect time?

And told them

00:14:01,107 --> 00:14:02,507
- I doubt that,

354
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:04,843
And i certainly doubt that
you'll find it by 7:00.

355
00:14:04,845 --> 00:14:06,911
So instead of me telling you
what i have on jack,

356
00:14:06,913 --> 00:14:08,112
Let me tell you
what i have on you.

357
00:14:08,114 --> 00:14:09,614
You vote with me today

358
00:14:09,616 --> 00:14:12,050
And your sister's company lives.

359
00:14:12,052 --> 00:14:13,351
- What?
- Oh, it turns out

360
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:16,054
My client is looking to get into
the muffin business.

361
00:14:16,056 --> 00:14:17,522
- You leave my sister
out of this.

362
00:14:17,524 --> 00:14:19,157
- Sure thing.

363
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:21,059
As long as you vote
to remove jessica.

364
00:14:21,061 --> 00:14:23,061
- I can't do that.

365
00:14:23,063 --> 00:14:25,330
- Then i'm not only
gonna buy it,

366
00:14:25,332 --> 00:14:28,266
I'm gonna rip that company
of hers apart.

367
00:14:28,268 --> 00:14:30,134
- You son of a bitch!
She never did anything to you.

368
00:14:30,136 --> 00:14:31,936
- No.

369
00:14:31,938 --> 00:14:32,971
But you did.

370
00:14:32,973 --> 00:14:34,606
And jessica did.

371
00:14:34,608 --> 00:14:37,008
And harvey did.

372
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:39,544
So you have a choice,

373
00:14:39,546 --> 00:14:43,081
Your firm or your family.

374
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:54,893
- Michael?

375
00:14:54,895 --> 00:14:56,895
<i>It's been a long time.</i>

376
00:14:56,897 --> 00:14:58,930
- People have been calling me
that a lot lately.

377
00:14:58,932 --> 00:15:02,400
- Maybe it's a sign.

378
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:04,068
How can i help you?

379
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:06,304
- I need to talk to someone.

380
00:15:06,306 --> 00:15:09,641
I was hoping to do it
under the confessional.

381
00:15:09,643 --> 00:15:11,609
- How long has it been
since your last confession?

382
00:15:11,611 --> 00:15:13,511
- Aren't you supposed to
ask me that after we started?

383
00:15:13,513 --> 00:15:14,579
- We have started.

384
00:15:14,581 --> 00:15:17,282
Have a seat.

385
00:15:17,284 --> 00:15:18,516
- Here?

386
00:15:18,518 --> 00:15:19,684
- Why not?

387
00:15:19,686 --> 00:15:21,586
Confession's meant to be
good for the soul

388
00:15:21,588 --> 00:15:23,388
And no one's ever said anything
about it having to be done

389
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:26,124
In a little dark box.

390
00:15:26,126 --> 00:15:28,526
Please.

391
00:15:29,996 --> 00:15:32,063
- You gave that paper an f?

392
00:15:32,065 --> 00:15:33,748
It deserves an a.

393
00:15:33,749 --> 00:15:35,432
- What about the fact that
you cut the entire afternoon

394
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:37,101
Last tuesday?
- I had a doctor's appointment.

395
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:38,503
- You even had a note
from your grandmother.

396
00:15:38,505 --> 00:15:40,004
- That's right, i did.

397
00:15:40,006 --> 00:15:41,589
- The problem is, michael,

398
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:43,173
Your grandmother wrote me
a note yesterday

399
00:15:43,176 --> 00:15:45,176
Thanking me for letting
her book club use the library.

400
00:15:45,178 --> 00:15:48,079
And those two signatures,

401
00:15:48,081 --> 00:15:51,149
They don't look the same at all.

402
00:15:53,153 --> 00:15:54,385
- Okay, well, if you're
so sure i did this,

403
00:15:54,387 --> 00:15:56,120
Then why are you
only giving me an f

404
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:57,622
And not suspending me?

405
00:15:57,624 --> 00:15:59,357
- Because i don't think
it's a coincidence that

406
00:15:59,359 --> 00:16:02,193
You chose to cut class on
parent-teacher conference day.

407
00:16:02,195 --> 00:16:04,429
- That had nothing
to do with it.

408
00:16:04,431 --> 00:16:06,998
- Mike, your grandmother told me
about the books you threw out.

409
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,533
- Every parent in the world
is obsessed

410
00:16:08,535 --> 00:16:09,734
With their kid
cleaning their room.

411
00:16:09,736 --> 00:16:11,219
I actually do it,

412
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,703
And the two of you make
a federal case out of it.

413
00:16:12,706 --> 00:16:14,272
- You didn't throw out
those books to clean.

414
00:16:14,274 --> 00:16:16,407
You did it because you saw
those kids out there

415
00:16:16,409 --> 00:16:18,076
With their parents

416
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:20,244
And you just couldn't
deal with that pain.

417
00:16:20,246 --> 00:16:23,314
So you cut class, you went home,

418
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:25,650
And you threw away the books.

419
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:27,886
- You don't know what i did.

420
00:16:27,887 --> 00:16:30,121
- What i do know is that your
parents came here every sunday

421
00:16:30,123 --> 00:16:32,590
And donated money
to pay for that uniform

422
00:16:32,592 --> 00:16:34,993
Because they wanted you to
be here getting an education

423
00:16:34,995 --> 00:16:36,528
And not cutting class.

424
00:16:36,529 --> 00:16:38,062
- I've gotten a perfect grade
on every assignment

425
00:16:38,064 --> 00:16:39,430
I've ever gotten, all right?

426
00:16:39,432 --> 00:16:41,432
And i don't need to go to
your stupid class to do it.

427
00:16:41,434 --> 00:16:43,001
- I could have suspended you,

428
00:16:43,003 --> 00:16:44,402
And that would have been
much worse than an f.

429
00:16:44,404 --> 00:16:46,771
But you're getting one
or you're getting the other.

430
00:16:46,773 --> 00:16:50,641
So why don't you take
one night off from blaming me,

431
00:16:50,643 --> 00:16:53,544
And you decided what it is
that you're gonna do?

432
00:16:54,647 --> 00:16:55,680
- Harvey,

433
00:16:55,682 --> 00:16:56,781
What are you doing here?

434
00:16:56,783 --> 00:16:59,417
- I wanted to ask you something.

435
00:16:59,419 --> 00:17:01,185
I was wondering if
i could stay with you

436
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:02,787
While i do my clerkship.

437
00:17:02,789 --> 00:17:05,289
- You want to stay with me
for the summer?

438
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:07,125
- I promise you won't
even know i'm there.

439
00:17:07,127 --> 00:17:09,077
- Are you crazy?

440
00:17:09,078 --> 00:17:11,028
Do you have any idea what the
people around here would think

441
00:17:11,031 --> 00:17:12,130
If they found out?

442
00:17:12,132 --> 00:17:13,731
- Who says
they're gonna find out?

443
00:17:13,733 --> 00:17:16,167
I mean, no one knows anything
about your personal life anyway.

444
00:17:16,169 --> 00:17:18,169
- Harvey, what's going on?

445
00:17:18,171 --> 00:17:19,504
- Things aren't good at home.

446
00:17:19,506 --> 00:17:20,772
- Your brother?

447
00:17:20,774 --> 00:17:22,573
- It's my parents.

448
00:17:22,575 --> 00:17:24,175
- Listen, harvey,
i know what it's like

449
00:17:24,177 --> 00:17:26,144
To be living in a home
that's not right,

450
00:17:26,146 --> 00:17:29,180
And i also know that you might
be tempted to fix things.

451
00:17:29,182 --> 00:17:31,115
But it's not up to
the children to fix things.

452
00:17:31,117 --> 00:17:33,084
- What if it was?

453
00:17:33,086 --> 00:17:34,619
- Then there's something wrong
with those two people.

454
00:17:34,621 --> 00:17:36,287
- No, there isn't.

455
00:17:36,289 --> 00:17:37,822
There's something wrong
with one of them,

456
00:17:37,824 --> 00:17:43,094
And i don't know whether to
tell the other one or not.

457
00:17:43,096 --> 00:17:46,397
- Look, harvey, i can't
tell you what you should do.

458
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:50,368
But i can tell you
if you come work for me,

459
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:52,837
You're gonna have to have
some difficult conversations.

460
00:17:52,839 --> 00:17:54,439
- That's work, this is family.

461
00:17:54,441 --> 00:17:58,509
- There are no more difficult
conversations than that.

462
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,147
But for the record,

463
00:18:03,149 --> 00:18:06,784
If you do come work here,

464
00:18:06,786 --> 00:18:10,855
We're gonna be family, too.

465
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:18,446
.

466
00:18:18,447 --> 00:18:19,763
- Hey there.

467
00:18:19,766 --> 00:18:21,833
Your father and marcus
will be here any minute,

468
00:18:21,835 --> 00:18:24,535
And, oh, i made your favorite,
chicken parm.

469
00:18:24,537 --> 00:18:25,837
- I'm glad they're not here.

470
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:27,238
It'll give me a chance
to tell you that

471
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,873
I'll pretend when they're here,

472
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:31,309
But i am not gonna pretend
when we're alone.

473
00:18:31,311 --> 00:18:34,112
- Harvey, please,
i'm still your mother.

474
00:18:34,114 --> 00:18:35,680
- No, you're not.

475
00:18:35,681 --> 00:18:37,247
- Hey, hey, hey,
look who's here.

476
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:39,817
I thought you were
working late tonight.

477
00:18:39,819 --> 00:18:42,120
- What's up, douche nozzle?

478
00:18:42,122 --> 00:18:44,188
- You remember bobby from down
at the shop, don't you, harvey?

479
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:46,424
<i>He's helping us get
the old mustang up and running.</i>

480
00:18:46,426 --> 00:18:48,826
- That's right, harvey,
i'm getting the mustang.

481
00:18:48,828 --> 00:18:50,428
And if you think you're ever
getting behind the wheel

482
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:51,796
Of that car...

483
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:52,864
- I'm never gonna get behind
the wheel of that car.

484
00:18:52,866 --> 00:18:54,198
- Because you're jealous.

485
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,266
- Because that car's
a piece of shit.

486
00:18:55,268 --> 00:18:57,535
- Harvey, watch your mouth.

487
00:18:57,537 --> 00:19:00,404
Lil, do we have enough for
an extra plate?

488
00:19:00,406 --> 00:19:01,873
- Sure.
How you doing, bobby?

489
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:04,709
- I'll be good as soon as
i get this grease off my hands.

490
00:19:04,711 --> 00:19:06,144
Where's the bathroom again?

491
00:19:06,146 --> 00:19:08,279
- It's down the hall, bobby.

492
00:19:08,281 --> 00:19:09,747
You know what?

493
00:19:09,749 --> 00:19:11,199
We don't need an extra plate
'cause i'm not eating.

494
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,650
- What are you talking about?
You're home early.

495
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:13,651
Your mother made chicken parm.

496
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:15,153
- Well, why don't you eat it?

497
00:19:15,155 --> 00:19:16,821
Because i can't stand
chicken parm anymore.

498
00:19:16,823 --> 00:19:18,923
- Where you going?
Harvey!

499
00:19:18,925 --> 00:19:22,627
This is still my house,
you know.

500
00:19:22,629 --> 00:19:24,896
- Is it?

501
00:19:26,533 --> 00:19:29,433
- So other people know
about you?

502
00:19:29,435 --> 00:19:32,670
- Not everyone
knows everything, but...

503
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:37,241
People know that
i don't have a law degree.

504
00:19:37,243 --> 00:19:40,745
- You say that as though
it were just a technicality.

505
00:19:40,747 --> 00:19:43,214
- And you say that
as if you're judging me.

506
00:19:43,216 --> 00:19:45,516
- Isn't that what you
came here for?

507
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:46,684
- I came here for advice.

508
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:49,187
- You said you came here
to confess.

509
00:19:49,189 --> 00:19:51,856
But it doesn't matter,
because if...

510
00:19:51,858 --> 00:19:52,924
Well, if you're looking
for absolution,

511
00:19:52,926 --> 00:19:53,958
I can't give it to you.

512
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,259
- Why not?

513
00:19:55,261 --> 00:19:58,729
- Because absolution
requires contrition,

514
00:19:58,731 --> 00:20:00,464
And i'm not hearing that
you even think

515
00:20:00,466 --> 00:20:01,732
You've done anything wrong.

516
00:20:01,734 --> 00:20:02,800
- Because using my brain
to help people

517
00:20:02,802 --> 00:20:04,368
Isn't doing anything wrong.

518
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:05,937
- You're not using
your brain to help people.

519
00:20:05,939 --> 00:20:07,905
You're using it to fool people,

520
00:20:07,907 --> 00:20:10,308
And you want me to tell you that
you're a good person for it.

521
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:11,609
- I am a good person.

522
00:20:11,611 --> 00:20:13,411
- You're a person that
wants to have their cake

523
00:20:13,413 --> 00:20:14,879
And eat it, too.

524
00:20:14,881 --> 00:20:16,514
And i'm afraid that
