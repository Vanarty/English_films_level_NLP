<i>...and then I swing you around there.</i>

00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:18,240
[both laugh]

3
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,320
Darling!

4
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:23,240
A bit smoother,
and then very, very close together.

5
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:24,760
[knocking, door opens]

6
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:32,560
The Duke and Duchess of York,
Your Majesty.

7
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,920
I won't see her. Just my brother.

8
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:59,640
-I gather you've made your decision.
-I have.

9
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,800
I'm afraid you won't thank me for it.

10
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,200
-Is she really worth it?
-I love her with all my heart.

11
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:17,920
Of course,
but more than your own... country?

12
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,760
Hmm?

13
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:24,320
More than your own family?
More than your own brother?

14
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,760
Yes.

15
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,000
You'll be fine.

16
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:35,160
You have a wife by your side
and heirs to spare.

17
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,120
My daughters.

18
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:44,080
This will... crush them.

19
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:53,360
If you stand down, I shall want you
and that woman gone for good.

20
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,360
Brother has indeed turned against brother.

21
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,120
Pay me to, brother...

22
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,440
and I'll be gone forever.

Ms. McDonald. His Majesty has asked
to see the two princesses.

28
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,040
[Ms. McDonald] Right. Come along, girls.

29
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,160
Lilibet.

30
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Margaret.

[George]<i> Your uncle has let us all down. </i>

32
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,520
<i>He put love before family.</i>

33
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:50,920
Now I want you to promise me one thing...

34
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:56,640
that you will never put anyone or anything

35
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,000
before one another.

36
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,440
You are sisters above all else.

37
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:08,320
And must never let one another down.

38
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,080
Understood?

39
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,880
Never.

40
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,560
Never.

41
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,560
-[Queen]<i> Happy birthday, Margaret.</i>
-[Margaret]<i> Thank you. </i>

42
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:48,280
So, I've done what you all asked
and waited two years,

43
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,280
but now that I am 25,

44
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,040
and free to decide for myself
whom I will marry,

45
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,400
it is with great pleasure...

46
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,320
Thank you.

47
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:02,720
...great pleasure and pride,
that I say I am still committed to Peter.

48
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,640
I've kept my side of the bargain.

49
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:12,720
-Now I'm hoping you'll keep yours.
-Of course.

50
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:19,600
-[all] Happy birthday!
-Thank you!

51
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,680
[bell rings]

52
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,360
-Afternoon, Ma'am.
-Yes, thank you, Michael.

53
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:46,120
One or two bits and pieces.

54
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:50,560
A request from our neighbor,
Captain Farquharson,

55
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:53,520
wanting to lease a few acres
of Balmoral grouse land

56
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,080
in exchange for the acres
which we leased from him last year.

57
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,440
Now, I spoke to the head keeper

58
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:03,040
and he advised checking nest stocks
before responding.

59
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,120
Yes, that seems very sensible.

60
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:11,080
And a card from the Mayor of Easter Ross,
whose 70th it is this year.

61
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:14,120
Yes, he's not been well, has he?

62
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:17,920
A stroke, earlier in the year,
but he'll mend now, I'm happy to say.

63
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,360
Good.

64
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,880
That's everything from me, Ma'am.
Anything from you?

65
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:27,200
Yes. An instruction
to put things in motion,

66
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,840
as regards Group Captain Townsend's
return to the country.

67
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,160
-Ma'am?
-As you know,

68
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:36,000
my sister is now free from the constraints
of the Royal Marriages Act

69
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,920
and no longer requires
my consent to marry.

70
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,640
Yes.

71
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,880
What is it that you're not saying,
Michael?

72
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:49,360
Well, there is still the other hurdle.

73
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,640
The second part
of the Royal Marriages Act.

74
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,440
The fact that Her Royal Highness
has turned 25

75
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,240
merely means that she has reached an age

76
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:02,080
where she can give notice
of her intention to marry.

77
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,640
Not that she is free to marry.

78
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,800
What?

79
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,760
Well, if both
Houses of Parliament approve,

80
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:14,480
only then, after 12 months have expired,
can the marriage take place

81
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:19,520
and any marriage
contracted in defiance of these rules

82
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:22,600
would be void.

83
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,720
Why did no one tell me this at the time?

84
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,400
To which I hope you replied...

85
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:32,640
"It's always been there, Ma'am,
in black and white."

86
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,400
Yes, but no one drew my attention to it
or said anything.

87
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,480
This is going to be very difficult.

88
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,160
I'm sorry.

89
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:47,280
I do feel that we've left her
in a difficult spot.

90
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,920
[Lascelles] T<i>he Queen Mother</i>
<i>always believed that two years'</i>

91
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,400
separation would be long enough
for Princess Margaret

92
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,960
to lose interest in the Group Captain

93
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:59,640
<i>and the whole thing to go away.</i>
<i>But she hasn't, and it hasn't.</i>

94
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:05,600
<i>And if anything, the Queen's dilemma</i>
<i>at the heart of it all is only more acute.</i>

95
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,400
<i>Either she puts her foot down</i>
<i>and forbids the marriage...</i>

96
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:13,960
That turns sister against sister and
splits the Royal house down the middle.

97
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:18,480
...or she permits the marriage,
setting a collision course

98
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,600
with the Church
of which she herself is the Head.

99
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:26,440
<i>Well, let me give it some more thought.</i>
<i>We'll speak in the morning.</i>

100
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,520
<i>-Good night, Michael.</i>
-Thank you, sir.

101
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,720
[Philip] Take a worm.

102
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,920
-[Charles] What?
-[Philip] A worm.

103
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,920
With your fingers, go on.
They won't bite, they're worms, boy!

104
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,760
That's it! Good boy.

105
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:56,760
-It's wriggling.
-Of course it's wriggling, it's a worm.

106
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:59,920
It'll stop wriggling
once you put it on the hook.

107
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,040
So, I was thinking about a week on Monday.

108
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,840
What for?

109
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,960
To make the announcement.
The engagement.

110
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:19,040
Would you mind holding off?
Just a moment longer?

111
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:24,320
Everything's fine, don't worry.
There's just been a slight wrinkle.

112
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,320
What's a wrinkle?

113
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,200
Oh, no, a formality,
which no one told me about.

114
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,040
It will take a little longer
than expected.

115
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,520
Well, how much longer?
We've waited two years already.

116
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,000
-I understand.
-And Peter's been through hell.

117
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,680
-I know.
-Waiting like a martyr.

118
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,160
-Locking himself away...
-I know.

119
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,200
...seeing no one. Speaking to no one.

120
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,680
I've been crying into my pillow at night,
counting the days.

121
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,680
Why? Why?
Because we were doing you a favor...

122
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,600
-I'm aware of that!
-To spare you your blushes.

123
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,000
To make your life easier.

124
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,880
I know, and I'm going to take care of it.

125
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:56,080
Look, I probably
shouldn't have said a thing.

126
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:13,360
We're going to go up in three, OK?
One, two, three... cast!

127
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,600
[Philip] Come on. Let's try again.
Hold this, please.

128
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:21,800
-[Charles] I'm trying!
-[Philip] Yeah, well, try harder.

129
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:24,280
-[Charles] It's difficult, Daddy.
-[Philip] No, it's not difficult.

130
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:27,040
Come on. If you don't try again,
you'll never catch a fish.

131
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,960
He dominates that poor boy.

132
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,400
[Queen] He can be very kind, too.

133
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,840
Watch what I do.

134
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,200
And he's wonderful with Anne.

135
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:41,160
[Philip] And here,
then back to here, and cast...

136
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,840
I still think he's too hard on him.

137
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,400
Taking out his own frustrations
on an innocent child.

138
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,760
I had lunch with Tommy Lascelles
last week and we both agreed

139
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:58,440
that Philip still hasn't settled
and struggles with life in your shadow.

140
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:02,240
[Philip] Come on, Charles.
Let's do this. Let's have another go.

141
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,240
Tommy came up with an interesting notion.

142
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,600
[Philip] Hey, there you go!

143
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,960
-[Charles] Mummy, I caught one!
-Well done!

144
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,040
[Philip laughs]

145
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,120
[Philip]<i> Have you noticed something</i>
<i>about our children?</i>

146
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,720
-They're the wrong way round.
-What?

147
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,920
Well, our daughter's a boy
and our son is, God bless him, a girl.

148
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,040
-Don't be silly. He's just sensitive.
-Have you seen him fish?

149
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,520
A girl.

150
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,480
What's the matter? You seem preoccupied.

151
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:37,760
I am. I've got problems with Margaret,
and Mummy's been interfering.

152
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:40,480
-Surprise, surprise.
-Along with everything else.

153
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,760
Would you hate the idea
of going to Australia?

154
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:48,440
-What for?
-To open the Olympic Games.

155
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:54,320
The Olympics are in November, aren't they?
You can't go in November.

156
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:58,360
Oh, no, I didn't mean with me,
I meant alone. In my name.

157
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,760
Right. Whose idea was that?

158
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,920
Does it matter?

159
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,080
-Would you agree to it?
-No, I'd be gone months.

160
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:15,080
-Weeks.
-Away from you. Away from the children.

161
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,880
-Yes, but would you do it?
-No.

162
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,800
Oh, please.
Everyone just wants you to be happy.

163
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,560
Nobody gives a fig about my happiness.

164
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:25,520
Yes, they do.
They want you to be stable and fulfilled.

165
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,760
Everybody wants you happy, stable and
fulfilled. They wish I'd just disappear.

166
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:32,000
No, they just think you'd benefit
from the attention.

167
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,320
-And preferably never come back.
-No, just come back...

168
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,440
What?

169
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,280
What? Say it.

170
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:40,880
Say it. A different man?

171
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,600
No, not that.

172
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:44,800
What, then?

173
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,440
Say it, pick the adjective.

174
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,800
All right, yes.

175
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:51,800
Changed.

176
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,840
[man on TV] <i>Princess Margaret,</i>
<i>third in line for the throne of Britain,</i>

177

<i>of her own destiny.</i>

178
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,520
<i>Pressmen and sightseers throng the lanes,</i>
<i>undeterred by the official statement</i>

179
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:11,600
<i>that no announcement is contemplated</i>
<i>at present about the Princess' future.</i>

180
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,360
<i>Meanwhile, the new Prime Minister,</i>
<i>fresh off the plane from Cairo,</i>

181
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,720
<i>travels to Scotland to brief the Queen</i>

182

[car horn honking]

184
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:26,080
[man] Mr. Eden! Have you come to
discuss Princess Margaret's marriage?

185
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,440
[car horn]

186
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,880
[car pulls up outside]

187
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,160
-[Philip] Margaret!
-Oh, hello.

188
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,800
Where are you going?
Prime Minister's just arrived.

189
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,080
Taking to my bed.

190
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,200
I intend to remain in sulk
for at least a week.

191
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:56,640
-Oh, dear. Don't tell me, my wife?
-Yes.

192
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,480
-Your tie.
-Thank you.

193
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:03,480
It's not easy. I'm a little fed up
with her myself, truth be told.

194
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:05,640
Why? What's she done to you?

195
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,120
Don't get me started.

196
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,240
Is she making life difficult
for you and Peter?

197
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:13,120
-Yes, she wants to delay the engagement.
-Well, it serves you right quite frankly.

198
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,240
You both seem far too happy
and far too in love.

199
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,160
-Do we?
-Yes.

200
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:21,560
It's easy to be in love with someone
who's not here, isn't it?

201
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:25,840
Yes. Perhaps that's why
she's sending me away. Chin up!

202
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,600
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

203
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,240
Would you excuse me?

204
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:11,840
-The Prime Minister, Your Majesty.
-Yes.

205
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,720
I've just been reading about
your difficulty with Colonel Nasser.

206
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,640
Have the newspapers
exaggerated it terribly?

207
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,640
To a very significant degree, yes.

208
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,720
Oh, well, you can tell me
all about it in the car.

209
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,880
I thought rather
than have our audience in the study,

210
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,160
we could get some fresh air.

211
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,680
You must be longing for a walk
after your journey.

212
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:31,520
Do you have any outdoor shoes?

213
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,760
Galoshes, Ma'am.

214
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:35,360
Well, you might need something
sturdier than that. Come on!

215
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,000
She's a bit throaty, I'm afraid.

216
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,040
We've been having trouble
with the fuel pump.

217
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,840
[Queen] Tell me about Colonel Nasser.

218
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:06,960
[Eden] Well, the trouble started
the minute we landed in Cairo.

219
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:15,640
<i>I got off the plane and made a statement</i>
<i>to local reporters, in Arabic.</i>

220
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:20,600
-You speak Arabic?
-Very badly. I studied it at Oxford.

221
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:25,440
[Eden speaks Arabic]
I am delighted to be here in Cairo

222
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:28,560
to meet with Colonel Nasser...

223
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:31,600
<i>to continue discussions</i>
<i>regarding the funding</i>

224
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,280
<i>for his grand Aswan Dam project.</i>

225
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,600
[in Arabic]
His Arabic is good.

226
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,960
[Eden] <i>Thank you.</i>

227
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,520
[in Arabic]
Very good.

228
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,480
Too good.

229
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:50,280
I'm sure the Colonel
would have been charmed by that.

230
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,400
On the contrary.

231
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,480
[Eden] That night,
there was a dinner at our Embassy...

232
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,760
<i>-He came in uniform.</i>
-[Queen]<i> Military uniform?</i>

233
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:00,880
[Eden]<i> Yes.</i>

234
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,080
[Queen]<i> Whatever for?</i>

235
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:06,120
[Eden]<i> One would think the clue</i>
<i>would be in the invitation to dinner</i>

236
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,920
<i>that one would wear a dinner jacket.</i>

237
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,240
<i>He came as if we'd invited him to battle</i>
<i>and promptly behaved like that.</i>

238
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:15,040
[speaks Arabic]
Your Excellency Prime Minister Eden.

239
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,880
Is anything the matter?

240
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:22,600
No one told me
it was formal dress tonight.

241
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:27,760
No matter, sir. It's just a suit.

242
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,640
But the wrong suit.

243
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:34,160
[Eden] Sensing his embarrassment
and wishing to spare him further blushes,

244
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,200
I tried to make the situation better.

245
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:41,840
[speaks Arabic]
If I was as decorated as you, sir,

246
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:47,800
I would wear my uniform all the time.
Wouldn't take it off.

247
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:52,360
You think I don't know?

248
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:59,360
That you received the Military Cross
for bravery in the First World War,

249
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:03,760
and were the youngest brigade-major
in the British Army, at 21.

250
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:09,280
You are more decorated than me...

251
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,280
Captain Eden.

252
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:19,960
[Eden] That night,
the Voice of Egypt radio station in Cairo

253
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:25,160
claimed that Nasser had been deliberately
humiliated by the Imperious British.

254
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:29,240
Oh, dear. It might be worth
extending the hand of goodwill.

255
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,720
Indeed we are, Ma'am.

256
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:35,040
We're bending over backwards
to help him fund this dam project.

257
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,960
Things here could do with
a little settling, too.

258
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,520
My sister's engagement.

259
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,360
This was their favorite place.

260
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,800
They would ride out here together.

261
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,400
And put a single stone down
for each time they met.

262
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:08,320
I thought this would be the perfect spot
for us to discuss the matter.

263
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:14,040
You see,
I gave my sister my assurance

264
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:17,880
that if she waited until the age of 25,
she could do as she likes.

265
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:21,320
Now I discover that's not true,

266
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:24,320
and that she still needs to wait a year
to get permission from Parliament.

267
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:28,240
Which is not the advice
that I originally received.

268
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,320
Yes.

269
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:36,560
And I'm afraid to say that,
even if she were to ask that permission,

270
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,920
I cannot guarantee that she would get it.

271
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,160
Why?

272
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:44,000
Because a good many
remain opposed to the idea

273
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,760
on religious grounds.

274
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,640
Then advise me.

275
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:59,080
Group Captain Townsend will be leaving
Brussels and returning home shortly,

276
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:02,880
having done exactly
what we asked him to do.

277
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:07,560
How can I keep my word after I gave it
knowing only half the facts?

278
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:13,560
Let me take the temperature
of the Cabinet.

279
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,520
We must not forget
that times are changing.

280
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,320
Morality is changing.

281
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,840
The country is changing.

282
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,520
[traditional music plays]

283
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:51,920
So, it was your idea, was it?
Dispatching me to the penal colonies?

284
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,760
If you mean entrusting you
to go to Melbourne

285
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,640
to open the Olympic Games alone,
actually it was Tommy Lascelles.

286
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,040
Oh, your puppet. I might have guessed.

287
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,640
-And you ought to be flattered.
-To be trusted to cut a ribbon?

288
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:09,280
-To be given that level of freedom.
-What freedom? I have no freedom.

289
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,360
You have more freedom
than any consort in history.

290
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:15,520
And you repay it by scowling and skulking
like an adolescent.

291
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,480
So go.

292
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:24,680
Have some time in the spotlight, be the
main attraction, and enjoy the attention.

293
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,600
Hopefully it will do you some good.
You might finally be less resentful

294
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:32,520
and more supportive
of my daughter in her duty.

295
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,880
-When's the wedding day, sir?
-Are you going to make an announcement?

296
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,960
Anything you'd like to share,
Mr. Townsend?

297
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:05,920
Mr. Townsend! Captain Townsend!
When's the wedding day?

298
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,760
[chattering]

299
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,320
-Prime Minister.
-Michael.

300
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,520
Sir.

301
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:37,080
[Eden]<i> I discussed the matter this morning</i>
<i>with the Attorney General</i>

302
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:42,280
and he advised
that there was no easy way

303
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:45,960
around the governing rules
of the Royal Marriages Act.

304
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,400
Furthermore...

305
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:54,840
several senior members of Cabinet
remain violently opposed.

306
00:23:55,880 --> 00:24:00,600
Indeed, Lord Salisbury has made it clear
that he would resign from Government,

307
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:05,640
rather than submit to what he considers
a subversion of the Church's teachings...

308
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:12,720
the Holy Sacrament of Marriage
and the decay of moral standards.

309
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:19,960
-But I realize this doesn't help you.
-No.

310
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,960
So if it is...

311
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:28,240
Your Majesty's intention
to support your sister,

312
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,480
come what may?

313
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:31,920
It is.

314
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,360
Then the best I can offer is to...

315
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,800
place a Bill of Renunciation
before Parliament.

316
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:46,160
It would deprive her of all her rights,
privileges and income.

317
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:51,680
She would have to be married
in a civil ceremony abroad.

318
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:57,640
And be obliged to live out of the country
for several years.

319
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,960
But you will have kept your word.

320
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,240
And she will have prevailed

321
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:10,280
and will be Mrs. Peter Townsend.

322
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:18,560
Of course. That's the strategy.

323
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,520
What strategy?

324
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:25,840
To force me into that choice and bank
on the fact that I would never do it.

325
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,760
"Oh, smart set Margaret.
Good time Margaret."

326
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:30,240
"She could never survive
without the trimmings?" I could.

327
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:34,520
I could live perfectly happily
without the staff, without the car,

328
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:37,080
without the parties,
without the attention.

329
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,200
Without the money. Effortlessly.

330
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:43,000
I am more than my title,
than these privileges.

331
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,560
Peter wouldn't want it anyway.

332
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:49,600
So if that's what's on offer, I'll give up
my title and we'll leave the country.

333
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:54,080
It's not what I want for you.
So please think about it.

334
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:56,280
I mean really, really think about it.

335
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,840
Fine.

336
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:05,600
And while I'm thinking about it,
perhaps you could think about this.

337
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,400
I have a country that is for me.

338
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,480
Newspapers that sympathize with me.

339
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:17,640
I represent what a growing majority want.
The future, not the past.

340
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:22,400
A kinder, more tolerant attitude
to marriage and divorce.

341
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,800
That's not me.

342
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,200
Fine.

343
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,600
Then a government in your name.

344
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:10,120
[car horns]

345
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,840
Slow down here.

346
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:27,160
[tires screech]

347
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:37,400
They tried to bribe my butler.
A hundred pounds! Can you imagine?

348
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:41,160
-For a photograph of the two of you.
-It's all rather too much, isn't it?

349
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:49,080
The house is under siege.
And you're the cause of it all, old boy.

350
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:54,200
Not bad, sweeping up
the most eligible woman in the world.

351
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:58,280
-Shall we?
-Yes.

352
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:01,920
-Peter?
-No, you dance, darling. I'll go to bed.

353
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,960
-You're sure?
-I'm quite sure.

354
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:48,320
-Hello.
-Hello.

355
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,400
[Margaret sighs, chuckles lightly]

356
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:03,200
-Everyone is still dancing.
-Then why are you here?

357
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:05,520
To tell you that I love you.

358
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,480
Thank you.

359
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:13,280
-And that they're just children.
-I know.

360
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:16,400
-And I'm mad for you.
-Me too.

00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:03,240

370
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,600
[clamoring]

371
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,800
[Queen] Since our last meeting,
I've been thinking a great deal

372
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:45,280
about something that my father said
to Princess Margaret and myself

373
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,240
at the time of the abdication.

374
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:51,760
He made us swear, as sisters,

375
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:55,200
never to put anything or anyone
before one another,

376
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:58,680
in the way that he felt his brother had.

377
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:05,080
It's an oath that we both made
and that... we intend to keep.

378
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:08,360
But I can't see how I'm to honor it.

379
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:13,440
It is my duty as Queen to refuse
Margaret marriage to a divorced man.

380
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:15,440
Everyone advises me so.

381
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:22,800
And yet I will be breaking a promise,
not only to my sister...

382
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,800
but also to my late father.

383
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:36,040
And the one body of people who might make
it possible for me to keep my promise...

384
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:38,800
is Cabinet.

385
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:46,480
A group whom I've learned count no fewer
than four divorced men in their number.

386
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:53,080
-Yes.
-Yourself included, Prime Minister.

387
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,200
Indeed.

388
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:58,160
Now, I wonder, in light of this,

389
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:03,960
whether you might go back
and use your considerable influence

390
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:08,160
and ask your Cabinet colleagues
if they might reconsider

391
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,680
their decision to oppose the marriage.

392
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,640
Certainly, Ma'am.

393
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,560
Although, I feel I should warn you

394
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:21,440
that there still will be the Church.

395
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:24,760
Yes, well, I'll see to that.

396
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:31,360
The Archbishops of Canterbury, and York.

397
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:37,960
The Bishop of Durham,
and is that Winchester?

398
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,120
Bath and Wells, Ma'am.

399
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:45,880
-The big guns.
-The four horsemen of the apocalypse.

400
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:53,360
[Archbishop]
<i>Marriage is a sacrament of God.</i>

401
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:57,560
The cornerstone
of our Christian family life.

402
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,800
Its foundation and its rock.

403
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:05,920
And according to the Canon law
of the Church of England...

404
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,200
indissoluble.

405
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:12,920
Put simply, there are no circumstances

406
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:17,880
where the Church might permit
the remarriage of divorced persons

407
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:21,680
while the husband or wife
of the former marriage is still alive.

408
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:26,840
Even if he was the innocent party?

409
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:29,360
No circumstances at all.

410
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,640
That makes my position very difficult.

411
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,560
To forbid the marriage
would risk breaking up my family.

412
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:39,080
Your Majesty, as Queen...

413
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:44,640
you are<i> Fidei defensor...</i>

414
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:49,960
defender of the faith.

415
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:56,280
That was the oath you made
at the coronation.

416
00:33:56,360 --> 00:34:00,440
[woman] <i>I married the man of my choice.</i>
<i>I'd like to think she could do the same.</i>

417
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:03,480
[man]<i> Well, the way I look at it,</i>
<i>if she really likes the fella...</i>

418
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:05,920
[Philip] Time to concede, it would seem.

419
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:11,000
-Give the people what they want.
-Do they really know what they want?

420
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:16,240
<i>Quite frankly, the world today</i>
<i>isn't what it was a few years ago,</i>

421
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,880
<i>and he was not the guilty party...</i>

422
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,200
I think they're making it very clear.

423
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:24,200
Well, the Archbishops
just made themselves clear, too.

424
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:28,560
You don't need to listen to them, surely?

425
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:31,720
As Head of the Church of England,
I thought I might.

426
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:32,800
Oh.

427
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:36,320
Well, in the name of the people
that live with you and love you,

428
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:39,440
might I suggest
not being Head of the Church for a minute.

429
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:42,200
Or Head of State,
or Head of the Commonwealth of Nations,

430
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,440
or the Army, or the Navy,
or the Government,

431
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:47,800
or the Fount of Justice,
or the whole damn circus, frankly.

432
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:52,360
-And be what?
-A living, breathing thing, a woman.

433
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:54,880
A sister. A daughter. A wife.

434
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:02,160
[knocks]

435
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,280
[man] All ready for you, Your Majesty.

436
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:12,840
Elizabeth...

437
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:22,280
[music playing]

438
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,320
I've been hoping to hear from you.

439
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:34,080
I've found myself hovering
by the phone for days.

440
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:37,600
<i>-Is it about Margaret?</i>
-Yes.

441
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,200
<i>The French are very much for her.</i>

442
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:42,000
<i>At least Paris is,</i>
<i>which is the only France that matters.</i>

443
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:44,040
<i>And are you for her, too?</i>

444
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:47,440
For Margaret, '<i>la Marianne,</i>'
how can I not be?

445
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:51,320
I share with her the fate
of having a great love

446
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:55,440
that captured
much of the country's imagination,

447
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,880
only to have it forbidden
by the establishment.

448
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:01,280
So, naturally, my sympathy is with her.

449
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,040
I see.

450
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:09,280
<i>But there is also</i>
<i>the other great love of my life...</i>

451
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,640
<i>the Crown.</i>

452
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:15,600
<i>And protecting that crown.</i>

453
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:21,000
<i>And I imagine you find yourself</i>
<i>in a difficult position now.</i>

454
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:23,440
Split down the middle.

455
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:29,080
One half is sister. One half is Queen.

456
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:30,160
<i>Exactly.</i>

457
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:34,680
A strange, hybrid creature.

458
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:38,960
Like a sphinx or Gamayun.

459
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,000
As I am Ganesha or Minotaur.

460
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,760
<i>We are half-people.</i>

461
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:53,120
<i>Ripped from the pages</i>
<i>of some bizarre mythology,</i>

462
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:57,000
<i>the two sides within us, human and crown</i>

463
00:36:57,080 --> 00:37:02,640
<i>engaged in a fearful civil war,</i>
<i>which never ends.</i>

464
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:08,600
And which blights
our every human transaction as...

465
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:11,600
as brother, husband...

466
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:16,760
<i>sister, wife, mother.</i>

467
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:22,800
I understand the agony you feel
and I am here to tell you,

468
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,240
it will never leave you.

469
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:29,160
<i>I will always be half-King.</i>

470
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:35,720
<i>My tragedy is that... I have no Kingdom.</i>

471
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:41,440
You have it. And you must protect it.

472
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:35,440
Her Royal Highness, Princess Margaret.

473
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:52,440
I've asked you here...

474
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:58,200
to say that
I've given the matter thought.

475
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:00,760
A great deal of thought.

476
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:06,680
The issue of your marriage has,
for the past weeks, months,

477
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:10,640
gone to the very heart of
a great number of things.

478
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:15,800
The country, morality, divorce.

479
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:22,680
But also something closer to home.

480
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,480
Who I am.

481
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:29,160
What I am.

482
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:33,080
And your marriage to Peter...

483
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:36,240
-Wait, I...
-No, please, Margaret.

484
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:44,280
It doesn't come naturally for me to
speak like this, so please let me finish.

485
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:50,160
It's involved going against
members of our family,

486
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:53,360
against senior courtiers, against Cabinet.

487
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:59,520
You know how I hate confrontation,
or mess, or dereliction of duty.

488
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:00,600
But...

489
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:07,280
I was prepared to go through it all
and support you, as a sister.

490
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:09,360
Because I'd given you my word.

491
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,000
But...

492
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:28,560
But?

493
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,160
But what?

494
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,080
But I realized...

495
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,080
as Queen...

496
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,080
that I have no choice.

497
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:59,640
I cannot allow you to marry Peter
and remain part of this family.

498
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:04,720
That is my decision.

499
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:26,600
In defiance of the pledge
you made to our father?

500
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:32,400
And the pledge you gave to me.

501
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:38,120
Yes.

502
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:03,000
Will you forgive me?

503
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:10,040
-If you deny me the man I love?
-If I put duty before family.

504
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:12,160
Would you forgive anyone
who denied you Philip?

505
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:17,480
-It doesn't compare.
-It compares exactly.

506
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:21,560
In marrying Philip, I wasn't violating
the scriptures or offending the Church.

507
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:34,120
I'm so sorry.

508
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:39,480
-You will love others.
-[whispers softly] No. Never.

509
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:49,720
Peter is the only one.

510
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:54,200
I understand that it feels like that now,
but Margaret...

511
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:58,200
I know I appear strong, but I'm not.

512
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:06,560
Peter is the only one who knows how to...

513
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:09,560
calm me, to reassure me, protect me.
Don't tell me you understand that.

514
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:13,200
You don't know for a minute
what it is to be...

515
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:16,880
unhinged.

516
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:20,360
Be flailing about.

517
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,800
Well, Peter is the only one...

518
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:32,640
who can hold me together.

519
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:40,440
Without him...

520
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:46,640
I'm lost.

521
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:48,600
I will never forgive her.

522
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:58,040
And I will never marry anyone else. Ever.

523
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:01,000
You're the only one.

524
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:15,320
[sighs deeply]

525
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:22,720
[Townsend]<i> I would like it to be known</i>
<i>that, Her Royal Highness,</i>

526
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:24,520
<i>the Princess Margaret and I...</i>

527
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,040
have decided not to marry.

528
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:39,760
<i>Mindful of the Church's teaching that</i>
<i>Christian marriage is indissoluble...</i>

529
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:47,240
<i>and accepting my position</i>
<i>as a divorced man...</i>

530
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:52,080
<i>and knowing how deeply religious faith</i>

531
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:56,840
and commitment to the Church runs
within the Princess...

532
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:02,160
<i>we have resolved</i>
<i>to make the ultimate sacrifice</i>

533
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:05,040
<i>and break off our relationship</i>
<i>with immediate effect.</i>

534
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:08,240
<i>Her Royal Highness,</i>
<i>the Princess Margaret and I</i>

535
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:12,280
<i>are strengthened by the unfailing support</i>
<i>of the Royal Family,</i>

536
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:13,920
<i>whom it has been my honor</i>

537
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:19,000
and my privilege to serve
for these last ten years.

538
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:26,720
I will now return to Brussels to continue
my important work as air attaché.

539
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:30,640
[man] Mr. Townsend,
would you like to make a comment?

540
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:38,800
[man on TV] <i>The 19 days between</i>
<i>Peter Townsend's return to London</i>

541
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:43,040
<i>and the Princess' decision</i>
<i>were a period of mounting suspense.</i>

542
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:45,520
<i>Now she has put her Royal duty first.</i>

543
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:49,000
<i>Outside Clarence House,</i>
<i>the day after the announcement,</i>

544
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:51,720
<i>people hoped to see and encourage her.</i>

545
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:54,520
<i>The hearts of all Britain</i>
<i>and the Commonwealth are</i>

546
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:56,040
<i>with the young Princess,</i>

547
00:46:56,120 --> 00:46:59,400
<i>who has chosen not self, but country.</i>

548
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:07,440
<i>The Group Captain flies back to Brussels,</i>
<i>the end of a story of love and duty.</i>

549
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:09,800
<i>With duty prevailing.</i>

550
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:19,360
[man] Apparently,
the Prime Minister called Nasser

551
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:21,720
in an attempt to defuse the situation,

552
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:25,520
but it seems the Egyptian leader
took offence again.

553
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:26,960
[Queen] Why this time?

554
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:32,600
Because the PM refused to speak a word
of Arabic, insisting on speaking English.

555
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:35,440
[Queen] What's the matter with that?

556
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:37,640
Aha.

557
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:40,800
Well, it seems Nasser hadn't arranged
for a translator to be present,

558
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:44,560
which left him exposed since he
doesn't speak sufficiently good English.

559
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:46,160
He felt tricked and humiliated

560
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:49,960
and has taken the whole thing
as a terrible affront.

561
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:53,760
There is some personal history
between the two men, I believe.

562
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:56,840
Oh, dear.
Well, I do hope it all calms down.

563
00:47:56,920 --> 00:47:58,800
[Philip clears his throat]

564
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,120
-I'm off.
-Where are you going?

565
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:17,200
[man] We are ready for Her Majesty.

566
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:20,800
To meet the president of the
Olympic Committee, as instructed.

567
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:25,920
They now suggest I combine
opening the games with a Royal Tour,

568
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:29,160
stay away even longer, five months.

569
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:34,360
A long way to go. A long time for
a father to be away from his children.

570
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:42,240
But no, if it gives me time
to reflect and work out my priorities

571
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:44,360
and to settle, not just in the marriage,

572
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:47,760
but you know, generally,
it'll be worth it.

573
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:50,920
Don't be like that.
Everyone's just trying to help.

574
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,400
Oh, yes, by putting a problem
on a boat to Australia

575
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:58,440
and hoping it sorts itself out
or better still, sinks.

576
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:02,960
You know it is possible
that you might enjoy it, and thank me.

577
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:07,560
Don't dress betrayal up as a favor.

578
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:20,160
Better go. Can't stand around chatting.

579
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:31,680
-Your Majesty!
-Will you be back late?

580
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:47,120
[Queen] I'll be right with you, Cecil.

581
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:00,000
-Good afternoon.
-Thank you, Your Majesty.

582
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:27,800
[speaking Arabic]
<i>Britain and the West despise Arabs.</i>

583
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:32,080
<i>Prime Minister Eden thinks</i>
<i>he can insult us.</i>

584
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:34,600
You can leave now, thank you.

585
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:37,360
<i>We will fight to the last drop</i>
<i>of our blood.</i>

586
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:49,920
[laughing and chattering]

587
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:09,520
Try standing up, Ma'am.

588
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:43,920
[man] That's it, there.

589
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:50,120
All hail sage Lady,
whom a grateful Isle hath blessed.

590
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:54,680
Not moving, not breathing.

591
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:59,720
Our very own goddess. Glorious Gloriana.

592
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:03,960
Forgetting Elizabeth Windsor now.

593
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:09,320
Now only Elizabeth Regina. Yes.
