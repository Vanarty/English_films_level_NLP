00:00:00,154 --> 00:00:02,054
Previously on <i>Suits...</i>

2
00:00:02,055 --> 00:00:04,390
This is Harvey Specter.
He's our best closer.

3
00:00:04,457 --> 00:00:05,858
Recruiting, your interviews
are set up for tomorrow.

4
00:00:05,926 --> 00:00:07,326
I work better alone anyway.

5
00:00:07,394 --> 00:00:08,661
We only hire from Harvard,

6
00:00:08,728 --> 00:00:10,496
and you haven't even gone
to any law school.

7
00:00:10,563 --> 00:00:11,697
What if I told you
that I consume knowledge

8
00:00:11,765 --> 00:00:12,998
like no one you've ever met,

9
00:00:13,066 --> 00:00:14,199
and I've actually passed
the bar.

10
00:00:14,267 --> 00:00:16,468
Okay, hotshot,
fire up this laptop.

11
00:00:16,536 --> 00:00:17,836
Stock option backdating.

12
00:00:17,904 --> 00:00:20,172
Under IRC section 409a.

13
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,507
You forgot
about Sarbanes-Oxley.

14
00:00:21,574 --> 00:00:23,008
Impressive, but you're sitting
at a computer.

15
00:00:23,076 --> 00:00:26,278
Playing Hearts.
If you want to beat me,

16
00:00:26,346 --> 00:00:27,513
you're going to have to do it
as something else.

17
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:28,781
How can you know all that?

18
00:00:28,848 --> 00:00:30,316
Once I read something,
I understand it.

19
00:00:30,383 --> 00:00:32,718
And once I understand it,

20
00:00:32,786 --> 00:00:33,886
I never forget it.

21
00:00:33,954 --> 00:00:35,421
I'm inclined
to give you a shot.

22
00:00:35,488 --> 00:00:37,256
But if they find out I lied
about you going to Harvard,

23
00:00:37,324 --> 00:00:39,625
they'll take away my license.
You what?

24
00:00:39,693 --> 00:00:41,126
Not now, Donna.

25
00:00:41,194 --> 00:00:42,695
The Harvard law school
alumni database.

26
00:00:42,762 --> 00:00:44,863
I'm not saying
you won't get caught,

27
00:00:44,931 --> 00:00:45,831
but it won't be because
your story doesn't check.

28
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:47,066
I'm Rachel Zane.

29
00:00:47,133 --> 00:00:48,801
I'll be giving you
your orientation.

30
00:00:48,868 --> 00:00:50,102
I love you.

31
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:51,770
Harvey's
your commanding officer.

32
00:00:51,838 --> 00:00:53,706
However, Louis Litt,
he oversees all associates,

33
00:00:53,773 --> 00:00:54,840
so you'll also answer to him.

34
00:00:54,908 --> 00:00:56,475
Welcome to Pearson Hardman.

35
00:00:56,543 --> 00:00:57,843
How many more chances
are you going to give that kid?

36
00:00:57,911 --> 00:00:59,912
I didn't realize
we were keeping score.

37
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:01,680
But if that's the case, I still
think he's coming out ahead.

38
00:01:01,748 --> 00:01:04,083
This habit of you empathizing
with every client...

39
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:05,617
it's not getting you anywhere.

40
00:01:05,685 --> 00:01:07,653
You need to deal in information
that can hold up.

41
00:01:07,721 --> 00:01:09,722
- That's what a real lawyer does.
- Why?

42
00:01:09,789 --> 00:01:11,190
- What?
- Fire me.

43
00:01:11,257 --> 00:01:12,291
Why would you do that to me?

44
00:01:12,359 --> 00:01:15,828
Life is this. I like this.

45
00:01:15,895 --> 00:01:18,530
It's tough to have a
relationship with a first-year,

46
00:01:18,598 --> 00:01:20,199
or any year.

47
00:01:20,266 --> 00:01:23,035
You're playing with me,
and you know it.

48
00:01:23,103 --> 00:01:25,237
You kept flirting with me long
after you started dating her.

49
00:01:25,305 --> 00:01:27,106
How about you find yourself
some other paralegal?

50
00:01:27,173 --> 00:01:29,174
Because, as far
as I'm concerned, we're done.

51
00:01:29,242 --> 00:01:31,844
How did you two meet?
I dated his best friend.

52
00:01:31,911 --> 00:01:33,245
You always liked her.

53
00:01:33,313 --> 00:01:34,813
Nothing happened
until Trevor and I were done.

54
00:01:34,881 --> 00:01:37,182
- Never?
- Well, we did kiss once.

55
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:38,817
- I can't.
- It's a real firm.

56
00:01:38,885 --> 00:01:40,686
But you can't tell anyone ever.

57
00:01:40,754 --> 00:01:41,987
This guy is not your friend,

58
00:01:42,055 --> 00:01:43,155
he is an anchor
dragging you down.

59
00:01:43,223 --> 00:01:44,223
Get rid of him.

60
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:46,091
He's my oldest friend.

61
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:47,326
I know you're seeing Jenny,

62
00:01:47,394 --> 00:01:51,330
but I can't stop thinking
about the kiss.

63
00:01:51,398 --> 00:01:52,464
I'm Trevor Evans.

64
00:01:52,532 --> 00:01:53,832
I'm a friend of Mike Ross. Yes.

65
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:55,167
I wish I didn't have
to do this.

66
00:01:55,235 --> 00:01:56,668
There's something you need
to know about him,

67
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:58,704
something Harvey Specter
hasn't told you.

68
00:02:36,543 --> 00:02:37,709
Nervous?

69
00:02:37,777 --> 00:02:41,246
I'd be lying if I said no.

70
00:02:41,314 --> 00:02:44,016
Well, I wouldn't
want you to lie.

71
00:02:44,084 --> 00:02:45,818
- She knows.
- She can't.

72
00:02:45,885 --> 00:02:47,086
She does.

73
00:02:47,153 --> 00:02:48,387
What's holding
on my Swinton merger?

74
00:02:48,455 --> 00:02:49,988
Are you kidding me?

75
00:02:50,056 --> 00:02:52,624
We've been over this, okay?
If she knew, you'd know.

76
00:02:52,692 --> 00:02:54,226
I do know.
The woman barely knows my name,

77
00:02:54,294 --> 00:02:55,461
and she just summoned me
for dinner.

78
00:02:55,528 --> 00:02:56,962
What is so funny?

79
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:59,565
Watson, Klyman, Gallo,
Goldberg, and Specter.

80
00:02:59,632 --> 00:03:01,934
- Why are you naming...
- The last five senior partners?

81
00:03:02,001 --> 00:03:03,936
Every one of us was taken
to dinner by Jessica

82
00:03:04,003 --> 00:03:05,237
as a first-year.

83
00:03:05,305 --> 00:03:06,872
And now she's taking you,
which means...

84
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:08,874
- This is a good thing.
- Exactly.

85
00:03:08,942 --> 00:03:10,209
Oh, God.

86
00:03:10,276 --> 00:03:11,310
- What now?
- What do I wear?

87
00:03:11,377 --> 00:03:13,312
Wh-what do I say?
What do I wear?

88
00:03:13,379 --> 00:03:15,681
We can discuss the prom
at recess.

89
00:03:15,748 --> 00:03:17,783
Tell me what the hell's
holding up my Swinton merger.

90
00:03:17,851 --> 00:03:19,318
Oh, it's just a nuisance suit

91
00:03:19,385 --> 00:03:20,919
that needs to be cleaned up
before we can clear escrow.

92
00:03:20,987 --> 00:03:22,321
I'm all over it.

93
00:03:22,388 --> 00:03:23,822
Why wasn't that
the first thing you told me?

94
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:25,190
Uh, I thought
I was getting exposed.

95
00:03:25,258 --> 00:03:26,825
This is
a little less important.

96
00:03:26,893 --> 00:03:29,161
My merger... your panic attack.

97
00:03:29,229 --> 00:03:30,562
Your compassion.

98
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:32,631
And I didn't have
a panic attack.

99
00:03:32,699 --> 00:03:34,166
I had a legitimate reason
for concern.

100
00:03:34,234 --> 00:03:36,768
Really? Why would she ask you
to dinner just to fire you?

101
00:03:36,836 --> 00:03:38,403
I don't know. A little
movie called <i>Goodfellas.</i>

102
00:03:38,471 --> 00:03:39,838
Did you see it?

103
00:03:39,906 --> 00:03:41,874
Joe Pesci thought he was
getting made... he got dead.

104
00:03:41,941 --> 00:03:43,509
That's your idea
of a legitimate reason?

105
00:03:43,576 --> 00:03:45,477
"Karen!
Where's the money, Karen?"

106
00:03:45,545 --> 00:03:48,113
- Go back to your cubicle.
- Hey, wait a minute. Do you...

107
00:03:48,181 --> 00:03:50,048
do you think that I might get
an office out of this dinner?

108
00:03:50,116 --> 00:03:51,750
A second ago, you thought
you were gonna get whacked.

109
00:03:51,818 --> 00:03:52,985
Now you want an office? What?

110
00:03:53,052 --> 00:03:54,319
I'm adapting
to changing circumstances.

111
00:03:54,387 --> 00:03:56,688
Huh. Well, maybe you won't be
the worst lawyer

112
00:03:56,756 --> 00:03:58,090
in the history of everything.

113
00:03:58,158 --> 00:04:00,759
"Put the gun down, Karen.

114
00:04:00,827 --> 00:04:02,361
Karen?"

115
00:04:02,428 --> 00:04:04,530
They never checked.

116
00:04:04,597 --> 00:04:05,731
What do you mean
"they never checked"?

117
00:04:05,798 --> 00:04:08,901
The Internet was not
what it is today.

118
00:04:08,968 --> 00:04:11,370
It was not so easy
to catch plagiarism.

119
00:04:11,437 --> 00:04:12,905
God, that's awesome.

120
00:04:12,972 --> 00:04:14,606
Wait a minute.

121
00:04:14,674 --> 00:04:17,009
If you graduated college then,
then that...

122
00:04:17,076 --> 00:04:18,143
that would make you...

123
00:04:18,211 --> 00:04:19,645
Old enough
to run my own law firm.

124
00:04:19,712 --> 00:04:21,380
But you look so young.

125
00:04:21,447 --> 00:04:23,649
- Well, you know what they say.
- Mm-hmm.

126
00:04:23,716 --> 00:04:26,785
- True beauty is ageless.
- Black don't crack.

127
00:04:26,853 --> 00:04:29,354
That's what I meant to say.

128
00:04:29,422 --> 00:04:32,024
Uhhuh.

129
00:04:32,091 --> 00:04:35,594
Well, enough about me.
I want to hear about you.

130
00:04:35,662 --> 00:04:39,831
What was Harvard like?

131
00:04:42,368 --> 00:04:43,702
I was three when I realized

132
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:46,438
that I wasn't like
the other kids.

133
00:04:46,506 --> 00:04:50,075
When school started,
it was like a joke.

134
00:04:50,143 --> 00:04:52,444
I didn't take notes.
I never studied.

135
00:04:52,512 --> 00:04:55,147
Every year
people would tell me,

136
00:04:55,215 --> 00:04:58,317
"Next year
you won't get away with it."

137
00:04:58,384 --> 00:05:01,253
Kept waiting for it
to get harder, but...

138
00:05:01,321 --> 00:05:03,355
it just never did.

139
00:05:03,423 --> 00:05:04,790
And Harvard?

140
00:05:04,857 --> 00:05:08,126
I knew it would end.
I mean, it had to.

141
00:05:08,194 --> 00:05:10,495
I thought, "Yeah,"
I'd finally found a place

142
00:05:10,563 --> 00:05:12,698
where I'd be, uh...

143
00:05:12,765 --> 00:05:14,433
exposed.

144
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:17,736
But it turns out, even
at the mighty Harvard Law...

145
00:05:17,804 --> 00:05:19,938
You weren't the same
as the other kids.

146
00:05:20,006 --> 00:05:23,475
- I know it sounds cocky.
- Not to me.

147
00:05:23,543 --> 00:05:26,144
The fact is, you don't think
of yourself as smart.

148
00:05:26,212 --> 00:05:28,747
You've always had your mind,
it just is what it is.

149
00:05:28,815 --> 00:05:30,415
Yeah,
that's exactly what it is.

150
00:05:30,483 --> 00:05:32,351
I don't think of myself
as smart, you know.

151
00:05:32,418 --> 00:05:34,152
I just think
of everybody else as...

152
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:37,689
- Idiots.
- Not smart.

153
00:05:37,757 --> 00:05:41,493
That's what I meant to say.

154
00:05:41,561 --> 00:05:44,363
Why the law?

155
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:46,231
It's kind of, uh, personal.

156
00:05:46,299 --> 00:05:48,634
Isn't that why we're here?

157
00:05:54,374 --> 00:05:55,540
When I was 11,

158
00:05:55,608 --> 00:05:58,343
my parents were
on their way home from dinner,

159
00:05:58,411 --> 00:06:02,247
and they were involved
in a really horrible accident.

160
00:06:02,315 --> 00:06:07,452
And, uh, they...

161
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,156
my grandmother took me in.

162
00:06:11,224 --> 00:06:15,294
And it wasn't until I was,
uh, much older

163
00:06:15,361 --> 00:06:18,497
that I realized
that we had a case.

164
00:06:18,564 --> 00:06:21,466
See, it turns out
this restaurant...

165
00:06:21,534 --> 00:06:24,503
they kept feeding
this Mr. Fenton drinks

166
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:27,439
long after they knew...

167
00:06:30,276 --> 00:06:32,878
didn't matter.

168
00:06:32,945 --> 00:06:35,047
I just...

169
00:06:35,114 --> 00:06:39,918
I felt so helpless.

170
00:06:39,986 --> 00:06:42,387
And I didn't want
to feel that way...

171
00:06:42,455 --> 00:06:45,290
ever again.

172
00:06:48,227 --> 00:06:51,697
Harvey was right.

173
00:06:51,764 --> 00:06:53,565
About what?

174
00:06:53,633 --> 00:06:56,568
I hope you brought
your checkbook.

175
00:06:56,636 --> 00:07:00,739
Dinner's on you.

176
00:07:00,807 --> 00:07:05,043
Wait.
What was Harvey right about?

177
00:07:19,726 --> 00:07:22,294
- How was dinner?
- Free caviar.

178
00:07:22,362 --> 00:07:23,595
What's not to love?

179
00:07:23,663 --> 00:07:24,496
If you want to know
something about me,

180
00:07:24,564 --> 00:07:26,498
you should have just asked me.

181
00:07:26,566 --> 00:07:28,567
Why can't I just be getting
to know Mr. Ross

182
00:07:28,634 --> 00:07:30,268
the way I got to know you?

183
00:07:30,336 --> 00:07:31,670
Because if you're just trying
to get to know him,

184
00:07:31,738 --> 00:07:33,171
you would have told me
about the dinner.

185
00:07:33,239 --> 00:07:36,808
Something's going on,
and I want to know what it is.

186
00:07:36,876 --> 00:07:38,276
An allegation was made

187
00:07:38,344 --> 00:07:40,011
that Mike Ross
never went to Harvard,

188
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:42,948
or any other law school
for that matter.

189
00:07:43,015 --> 00:07:46,385
So I had him checked out.

190
00:07:46,452 --> 00:07:48,220
Squeaky clean.

191
00:07:48,287 --> 00:07:50,322
Graduated top of his class.

192
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:51,690
So I took him to dinner.

193
00:07:51,758 --> 00:07:53,592
I wanted
to see what you saw in him

194
00:07:53,659 --> 00:07:54,826
that makes him so special.

195
00:07:54,894 --> 00:07:57,262
And?

196
00:07:57,330 --> 00:07:59,064
I get it.

197
00:07:59,132 --> 00:08:00,265
He's a total package.

198
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:03,902
Maybe even the best
of both of us.

199
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:05,137
I hope this doesn't mean
you're gonna put me

200
00:08:05,204 --> 00:08:06,605
in charge of recruiting.

201
00:08:06,672 --> 00:08:11,276
Not to worry.
You are off the hook.

202
00:08:11,344 --> 00:08:16,515
Harvey, one more thing.

203
00:08:16,582 --> 00:08:18,483
He might have
checked out clean,

204
00:08:18,551 --> 00:08:21,353
but I know
that kid's full of shit.

205
00:08:21,421 --> 00:08:22,921
Because there may be a record

206
00:08:22,989 --> 00:08:24,556
of him graduating
from Harvard Law,

207
00:08:24,624 --> 00:08:26,024
but there's no record
of him graduating

208
00:08:26,092 --> 00:08:29,861
from any college anywhere
on the face of the earth.

209
00:08:29,929 --> 00:08:32,197
So I'm gonna give you
the benefit of the doubt

210
00:08:32,265 --> 00:08:34,099
that you didn't know.

211
00:08:34,167 --> 00:08:37,235
Because I don't want to do
what I would do if you did.

212
00:08:37,303 --> 00:08:40,472
And what you're going to do is
fire that goddamn kid.

00:09:23,109 --> 00:09:24,075
and get Mr. Sherman
on the phone, please.

224
00:09:24,143 --> 00:09:27,512
Thank you.

225
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:30,482
- What was that?
- Excuse me?

226
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:32,517
"Please," "do me a favor,"
and "thank you,"

227
00:09:32,552 --> 00:09:33,852
all in the same sentence?

228
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,187
You think
I'm not gonna notice that?

229
00:09:35,254 --> 00:09:36,421
- I don't have time for this.
- You got time.

230
00:09:36,489 --> 00:09:37,789
You're gonna sit right there

231
00:09:37,857 --> 00:09:38,990
while I figure out
what the hell's going on.

232
00:09:39,058 --> 00:09:40,325
Nothing's going on.

233
00:09:40,393 --> 00:09:42,227
Dimple in your tie's
too far to the left.

234
00:09:42,295 --> 00:09:44,563
That says that your mind
is on something else.

235
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:47,833
Mr. Sherman's called 136 times,
you've never called him back,

236
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:50,669
which means
you're feeling guilty

237
00:09:50,736 --> 00:09:52,571
and you're trying to compensate.
I'm not trying to...

238
00:09:52,638 --> 00:09:53,939
I didn't say overcompensate.

239
00:09:54,006 --> 00:09:55,674
As long as we're clear.

240
00:09:55,741 --> 00:09:57,642
The only time
I've ever seen you wear lavender

241
00:09:57,710 --> 00:09:59,578
was when your brother
was in the hospital.

242
00:09:59,645 --> 00:10:01,646
You're feeling protective
in an older-brother manner.

243
00:10:01,714 --> 00:10:03,448
Whoa.

244
00:10:03,516 --> 00:10:05,283
Either your mother's
somehow appeared in your life,

245
00:10:05,351 --> 00:10:08,820
or Jessica found out
about Mike.

246
00:10:08,888 --> 00:10:11,489
Oh, my God.

247
00:10:11,557 --> 00:10:14,659
Does he know?

248
00:10:21,801 --> 00:10:23,335
♪ Yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah ♪

249
00:10:28,274 --> 00:10:29,841
What's playing on that thing?

250
00:10:29,909 --> 00:10:32,711
Uh, audiobook.
<i>Fall of the Roman Empire.</i>

251
00:10:32,778 --> 00:10:34,579
Ah. I was just rocking out
to Einstein's biography

252
00:10:34,647 --> 00:10:36,047
this morning. Ah.

253
00:10:36,115 --> 00:10:39,718
See, I prefer
his acoustic stuff.

254
00:10:39,785 --> 00:10:42,220
So you're awfully chipper.

255
00:10:42,288 --> 00:10:44,789
Maybe you got some good news?
Uh, yeah.

256
00:10:44,857 --> 00:10:48,159
That led to an amazing dinner
with an incredible woman.

257
00:10:48,227 --> 00:10:49,461
I'm really happy to hear

258
00:10:49,528 --> 00:10:51,029
things are going well
with you and Jenny.

259
00:10:51,097 --> 00:10:52,264
Whoa, no. No, no, no.

260
00:10:52,331 --> 00:10:54,666
I was out with Jessica
last night.

261
00:10:54,734 --> 00:10:57,402
Isn't she just
a little old for you?

262
00:10:57,470 --> 00:10:59,738
Uh, I do okay with the cougars.

263
00:10:59,805 --> 00:11:01,106
You realize you're talking
about the managing partner

264
00:11:01,173 --> 00:11:02,140
of the firm?

265
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:08,179
Please don't tell anyone
I said that.

266
00:11:08,247 --> 00:11:09,981
What are you gonna do?

267
00:11:10,049 --> 00:11:11,483
I'm gonna fire him.

268
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:13,084
How can you do that?

269
00:11:13,152 --> 00:11:14,753
What do you want me to say?
If I don't, Jessica will.

270
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:16,821
What's up, mother fleckers?

271
00:11:16,889 --> 00:11:19,891
Wow. Oh, my God.
That's a beautiful day.

272
00:11:19,959 --> 00:11:22,127
Hey, did you guys get that memo?
You know, the one about how...

273
00:11:22,194 --> 00:11:27,065
I am the greatest.

274
00:11:30,202 --> 00:11:32,504
What's wrong with you two?
Somebody die?

275
00:11:32,571 --> 00:11:35,774
I'm gonna be outside.

276
00:11:35,841 --> 00:11:37,642
"I'm gonna be outside.
I'm so serious.

277
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:38,743
All the time."

278
00:11:38,811 --> 00:11:40,478
- Mike?
- Uh-huh.

279
00:11:40,546 --> 00:11:41,913
Sit down.

280
00:11:41,981 --> 00:11:43,581
No can do.
I've got too much energy.

281
00:11:43,649 --> 00:11:44,883
I just wanted
to come and give you an update

282
00:11:44,951 --> 00:11:46,418
on the Swinton merger.

283
00:11:46,485 --> 00:11:48,320
Turns out this woman thinks

284
00:11:48,387 --> 00:11:49,888
that publishing stole one
of her book ideas.

285
00:11:49,956 --> 00:11:51,423
Filed suit. Listen.

286
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:53,058
Normally,
I'd suggest that we settle.

287
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:54,359
But then I got to thinking.

288
00:11:54,427 --> 00:11:56,561
WWHD...

289
00:11:56,629 --> 00:11:58,296
what would Harvey do?

290
00:11:58,364 --> 00:12:00,298
- Steamroll her.
- Exactly.

291
00:12:00,366 --> 00:12:01,599
Which is what I'm gonna do.

292
00:12:01,667 --> 00:12:04,502
Myra Harrison is not gonna know
what hit her.

293
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:06,504
Why embrace my philosophy now?

294
00:12:06,572 --> 00:12:09,841
Come on.
Your merger... Myra Harrison.

295
00:12:11,844 --> 00:12:14,079
Mike.

296
00:12:14,146 --> 00:12:16,481
Sit down.

297
00:12:33,566 --> 00:12:35,233
You okay?

298
00:12:35,301 --> 00:12:38,636
I can't talk right now.

299
00:12:42,808 --> 00:12:44,909
Okay, just get it over with.
Tell me what happened.

300
00:12:44,977 --> 00:12:47,278
The talk and the plan and
the whole "what I would do,"

301
00:12:47,346 --> 00:12:48,847
is just whatever.

302
00:12:48,914 --> 00:12:50,281
You couldn't do it.

303
00:12:50,349 --> 00:12:52,384
I <i>didn't</i> do it.

304
00:12:52,451 --> 00:12:54,119
You got overwhelmed
with a wave of emotion

305
00:12:54,186 --> 00:12:55,286
you didn't see coming.

306
00:12:55,354 --> 00:12:57,622
You cried, and you let him stay.
No.

307
00:12:57,690 --> 00:12:58,857
I thought of the amount of work
I would have to go through

308
00:12:58,924 --> 00:13:00,859
to replace him
and decided against it.

309
00:13:00,926 --> 00:13:03,294
Did you see the amount
of work through a pool of tears?

310
00:13:03,362 --> 00:13:04,829
- Are you finished?
- Can I get you anything?

311
00:13:04,897 --> 00:13:07,032
Tissue? Glass of water? Tampon?

312
00:13:07,099 --> 00:13:09,100
Okay, wait a second.

313
00:13:09,168 --> 00:13:12,837
You listen
to all my private conversations.

314
00:13:12,905 --> 00:13:15,240
- So?
- This time you didn't.

315
00:13:15,307 --> 00:13:17,909
- Yeah, I was busy.
- Busy?

316
00:13:17,977 --> 00:13:19,844
That's what you're going with?
Very busy.

317
00:13:19,912 --> 00:13:21,880
You didn't listen
because you couldn't listen.

318
00:13:21,947 --> 00:13:24,149
Because <i>you</i> were
too overwhelmed with emotion.

319
00:13:24,216 --> 00:13:25,884
I am not the topic
of conversation here.

320
00:13:25,951 --> 00:13:28,019
Can I get you anything?
Tissue? Water?

321
00:13:28,087 --> 00:13:31,122
I got it.

322
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:32,457
Harvey,

323
00:13:32,525 --> 00:13:34,859
you said if you didn't fire him,
Jessica would.

324
00:13:34,927 --> 00:13:36,828
So what are you gonna do?

325
00:13:36,896 --> 00:13:39,664
Buy us some time.

326
00:13:39,732 --> 00:13:41,032
Hey.

327
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,434
If you didn't
tell him anything,

328
00:13:42,501 --> 00:13:44,536
why was he so dazed
when he walked out of here?

329
00:13:44,603 --> 00:13:45,970
I told him I was proud of him.

330
00:13:46,038 --> 00:13:49,674
You need to give that boy
more encouragement.

331
00:13:53,913 --> 00:13:55,647
- Hi.
- Hey.

332
00:13:55,714 --> 00:13:56,881
Could you tell me
where I could find a copy

333
00:13:56,949 --> 00:13:59,517
of James Jenkins' latest book?

334
00:13:59,585 --> 00:14:02,787
Um, right there
in new releases.

335
00:14:02,855 --> 00:14:04,456
Oh, that's funny.

336
00:14:04,523 --> 00:14:06,191
'Cause I have a complaint here
that says

337
00:14:06,258 --> 00:14:09,594
that you're claiming
to have written his newest book.

338
00:14:09,662 --> 00:14:11,396
Sorry, who are you?

339
00:14:11,464 --> 00:14:13,765
My name's Mike Ross.
I represent Drecker Publishing.

340
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:15,133
I want to tell you the story

341
00:14:15,201 --> 00:14:16,701
of how your bullshit
lawsuit pans out.

342
00:14:16,769 --> 00:14:19,270
Best case, you prove
that they stole your idea.

343
00:14:19,338 --> 00:14:20,772
You know what?
It doesn't matter.

344
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:23,908
Because <i>you</i> signed
an employment agreement

345
00:14:23,976 --> 00:14:25,243
giving Drecker Publishing
the rights

346
00:14:25,311 --> 00:14:27,846
to all work product
that you create.

347
00:14:27,913 --> 00:14:29,681
So the next step is that
my firm's going to assign

348
00:14:29,748 --> 00:14:32,550
as many Mike Rosses as necessary
to dispatch your claim.

349
00:14:32,618 --> 00:14:33,885
And after we do,

350
00:14:33,953 --> 00:14:35,453
we're gonna add up
all of those hours,

351
00:14:35,521 --> 00:14:37,055
and we're gonna petition
the court

352
00:14:37,123 --> 00:14:38,923
to have <i>you</i> pay for our work.

353
00:14:38,991 --> 00:14:42,494
Now lucky for you, we happen
to be in the middle of a merger,

354
00:14:42,561 --> 00:14:44,162
and you're kind of being
an inconvenience.

355
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:46,231
So I get to be the good guy
who comes down here

356
00:14:46,298 --> 00:14:49,601
and strongly advises you to just
go ahead and give up now

357
00:14:49,668 --> 00:14:51,569
and save yourself
a whole lot of money.

358
00:14:51,637 --> 00:14:52,837
Anyway, that's all.

359
00:14:52,905 --> 00:14:54,739
Thank you so much
for your time,

360
00:14:54,807 --> 00:14:57,675
and have a nice day.

361
00:14:57,743 --> 00:15:00,578
I bet your mother's proud
of you.

362
00:15:00,646 --> 00:15:03,448
- Excuse me?
- You heard me.

363
00:15:03,516 --> 00:15:05,984
Standing there
in your fancy suit

364
00:15:06,051 --> 00:15:08,386
calling my story bullshit?
You don't even know what it is.

365
00:15:08,454 --> 00:15:10,021
Ms. Harrison,
it's not my job to...

366
00:15:10,089 --> 00:15:11,456
To what? To care?

367
00:15:11,524 --> 00:15:16,127
To be a human being?
To listen for two seconds?

368
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:21,633
I was an assistant
at Drecker for five years,

369
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:24,169
and I finally got an idea
for my own book.

370
00:15:24,236 --> 00:15:27,105
And my boss,
who I thought was my friend,

371
00:15:27,173 --> 00:15:29,474
encouraged me
to pitch my idea to her.

372
00:15:29,542 --> 00:15:31,943
So I did.
And she took that idea,

373
00:15:32,011 --> 00:15:33,711
served it up to James Jenkins,
and completely shut me out.

374
00:15:33,779 --> 00:15:35,446
You have no evidence of this,
all right?

375
00:15:35,514 --> 00:15:37,482
It's just your word
against hers.

376
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:38,716
That's not true,
my pitch was oral,

377
00:15:38,784 --> 00:15:40,051
but I wrote a treatment
to prepare for it.

378
00:15:40,119 --> 00:15:41,920
I can email you a copy.

379
00:15:41,987 --> 00:15:44,022
Myra, wh...

380
00:15:44,089 --> 00:15:45,723
what are you looking for here?

381
00:15:45,791 --> 00:15:47,225
These ideas aren't easy
to come by.

382
00:15:47,293 --> 00:15:49,994
I might not have another one
in my entire life.

383
00:15:50,062 --> 00:15:54,098
I just want to be paid
for my idea.

384
00:16:01,173 --> 00:16:03,641
Finally get your big promotion
to file clerk?

385
00:16:03,709 --> 00:16:05,109
For your information,

386
00:16:05,177 --> 00:16:06,044
I happen to be compiling
a redundancy list

387
00:16:06,111 --> 00:16:07,812
for the Swinton merger.

388
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,180
Well, while you're at it,
why don't you compile

389
00:16:09,248 --> 00:16:11,115
a redundancy list
for the Swinton merger?

390
00:16:11,183 --> 00:16:12,417
Instead of trying
to be hilarious,

391
00:16:12,484 --> 00:16:14,319
maybe you can just close
the deal,

392
00:16:14,386 --> 00:16:15,687
so then I can do my job

393
00:16:15,754 --> 00:16:17,322
and determine which departments
get bashed in the head.

394
00:16:17,389 --> 00:16:19,924
- What, are you killing seals?
- Would that it were.

395
00:16:19,992 --> 00:16:21,559
Rodents of the sea.

396
00:16:21,627 --> 00:16:25,263
Listen, I need you to lay off
Mike Ross for a while.

397
00:16:25,331 --> 00:16:26,598
Oh, do you now?

398
00:16:26,665 --> 00:16:28,166
Because he may be
your associate,

399
00:16:28,234 --> 00:16:30,602
but as I've told you, like,
I don't know, a million times,

400
00:16:30,669 --> 00:16:33,371
I run the associates.
I'm not disputing that.

401
00:16:33,439 --> 00:16:37,275
It's just with Jessica's
new interest in him...

402
00:16:37,343 --> 00:16:39,010
- What interest?
- Hadn't you heard?

403
00:16:39,078 --> 00:16:40,478
- Heard what?
- Never mind.

404
00:16:40,546 --> 00:16:42,614
No, tell me. Tell me now.

405
00:16:42,681 --> 00:16:44,882
Jessica took Mike
to dinner last night. Iago's.

406
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:46,985
Lag?

407
00:16:49,154 --> 00:16:50,688
That's where she took me.

408
00:16:50,756 --> 00:16:52,490
Really? Oh.

409
00:16:52,558 --> 00:16:55,660
Anyway, I'd consider it
a personal favor

410
00:16:55,728 --> 00:16:57,629
if you'd just lay off Mike
for a few days,

411
00:16:57,696 --> 00:16:59,731
but it's your call.

412
00:17:09,742 --> 00:17:11,943
Hey. Thanks.

413
00:17:12,011 --> 00:17:13,878
What are you doing here?

414
00:17:13,946 --> 00:17:15,346
Right now,

415
00:17:15,414 --> 00:17:18,516
I want to know what's going on
with you and Rachel.

416
00:17:18,584 --> 00:17:20,652
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

417
00:17:20,719 --> 00:17:21,986
Jenny, how many times
do I have to answer this?

418
00:17:22,054 --> 00:17:23,488
Excuse me?

419
00:17:23,555 --> 00:17:24,956
Every day it's a new time
you don't trust me.

420
00:17:25,024 --> 00:17:27,592
No, everyday it's
the same "I don't trust you."

421
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:30,728
You kissed her.

422
00:17:30,796 --> 00:17:32,230
Tell me that's not true.

423
00:17:32,298 --> 00:17:34,866
I... I didn't kiss her.
She kissed me.

424
00:17:34,933 --> 00:17:37,035
- Like that makes a difference.
- It does, all right?

425
00:17:37,102 --> 00:17:38,703
It happened,
but I didn't follow up on it.

426
00:17:38,771 --> 00:17:40,038
And what you're leaving out

427
00:17:40,105 --> 00:17:41,339
is that even after
all that happened,

428
00:17:41,407 --> 00:17:42,774
you asked me to choose,
and I chose you.

429
00:17:42,841 --> 00:17:44,342
I asked you if anything
ever happened

430
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:45,677
between the two of you,
and you lied.

431
00:17:45,744 --> 00:17:47,011
When you asked me that,

432
00:17:47,079 --> 00:17:48,579
you weren't asking about a kiss,
and you know it.

433
00:17:48,647 --> 00:17:49,947
I didn't lie,

434
00:17:50,015 --> 00:17:52,016
I just answered the question
that you really asked.

435
00:17:52,084 --> 00:17:54,385
Oh, you are such
a goddamn lawyer.

436
00:17:54,453 --> 00:17:56,054
Oh, wait, that's right...
you're not.

437
00:17:56,121 --> 00:17:58,222
All right, if kissing
someone else is so awful,

438
00:17:58,290 --> 00:17:59,524
then what about you?

439
00:17:59,591 --> 00:18:01,059
I seem
to remember you kissing me

440
00:18:01,126 --> 00:18:03,194
when you were still with Trevor.
When I kissed you,

441
00:18:03,262 --> 00:18:06,130
it was because you were the
person that I wanted to be with.

442
00:18:06,198 --> 00:18:08,333
Obviously, that's how
you feel about Rachel.

443
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,335
That wasn't true!

444
00:18:10,402 --> 00:18:13,705
Wasn't?

445
00:18:15,307 --> 00:18:17,975
Well, I hope...

446
00:18:18,043 --> 00:18:20,545
that you two
are really happy together.

447
00:18:20,612 --> 00:18:22,280
I'm sorry.

448
00:18:22,348 --> 00:18:25,516
You know,
you didn't ask me how I knew.

449
00:18:25,584 --> 00:18:27,585
Trevor told me.

450
00:18:27,653 --> 00:18:29,587
- What?
- Two days ago.

451
00:18:29,655 --> 00:18:31,089
Right before he told me

452
00:18:31,156 --> 00:18:32,390
that he was gonna tell
Jessica Pearson

453
00:18:32,458 --> 00:18:36,060
that you're a fraud.

454
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:30,872
Well, if it isn't
the anointed one.

455
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:32,474
Where the hell you been?

456
00:19:32,542 --> 00:19:34,242
Well,
I'm not feeling very well.

457
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:36,144
I don't really care.

458
00:19:36,212 --> 00:19:39,214
And I also don't care how
special Jessica thinks you are.

459
00:19:39,282 --> 00:19:42,651
<i>Because</i> you still answer to me.

460
00:19:42,718 --> 00:19:44,386
And you're gonna do every piece
of work that I assign to you

461
00:19:44,453 --> 00:19:45,654
until you don't.

462
00:19:45,721 --> 00:19:47,956
Yeah, um,
I just have to see Harvey first.

463
00:19:48,024 --> 00:19:49,658
Oh, no, no, no.
Harvey can't help you.

464
00:19:49,725 --> 00:19:51,259
Now I want the detailed listing

465
00:19:51,327 --> 00:19:53,361
of every redundant position
in the Swinton merger.

466
00:19:53,429 --> 00:19:55,897
And I want it yesterday,
<i>capisce?</i>

467
00:19:55,965 --> 00:20:00,468
And get a mint, because
your breath is disgusting.

468
00:20:04,707 --> 00:20:06,474
You drunk dialed him?

469
00:20:06,542 --> 00:20:08,977
I didn't drunk dial him.
I called him.

470
00:20:09,045 --> 00:20:10,512
Yeah, I left the room
for two minutes,

471
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:12,013
and you called him
after a glass of whiskey.

472
00:20:12,081 --> 00:20:13,648
What would you call it? Stupid.

473
00:20:13,716 --> 00:20:15,917
So what did you say
on the message?

474
00:20:15,985 --> 00:20:19,721
I said that I couldn't stop
thinking about our kiss.

475
00:20:21,958 --> 00:20:23,191
- You kissed him?
- Yes.

476
00:20:23,259 --> 00:20:25,827
- Where?
- On the mouth.

477
00:20:25,895 --> 00:20:28,964
- Where did it happen?
- In the library.

478
00:20:29,031 --> 00:20:31,766
- The Pearson Hardman library?
- No, the Library of Congress.

479
00:20:31,834 --> 00:20:33,335
- Was John Boehner there?
- Are you gonna help me?

480
00:20:33,402 --> 00:20:34,803
Or are you gonna
amuse yourself?

481
00:20:34,871 --> 00:20:37,072
- I can multitask.
- Oh.

482
00:20:37,139 --> 00:20:39,140
So what's the problem?

483
00:20:39,208 --> 00:20:41,076
The problem is
I left him that message

484
00:20:41,143 --> 00:20:44,746
three nights ago,
and he hasn't said anything.

485
00:20:44,814 --> 00:20:47,015
I don't know what to do.

486
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:49,184
Well, when a person
gets a message like that,

487
00:20:49,252 --> 00:20:51,319
and they act like they didn't,
it's one of two things.

488
00:20:51,387 --> 00:20:53,989
Either they got the message, and
they don't feel the same way,

489
00:20:54,056 --> 00:20:56,725
or they didn't get the message.

490
00:20:56,792 --> 00:21:00,428
And who doesn't get
their messages?

491
00:21:02,098 --> 00:21:03,465
He made his choice.

492
00:21:03,532 --> 00:21:06,001
- Whoa.
- What?

493
00:21:06,068 --> 00:21:07,802
I got to go.

494
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:10,005
- Okay.
- Wait a second.

495
00:21:10,072 --> 00:21:11,072
How was it?

496
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:13,708
The kiss?

497
00:21:13,776 --> 00:21:17,112
Good enough
to make me drunk dial him.

498
00:21:22,852 --> 00:21:24,653
Well,
what are we talking about?

499
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:28,189
Jeremy Lin?
Yeah, I can make that happen.

500
00:21:31,127 --> 00:21:32,427
You knew.

501
00:21:32,495 --> 00:21:34,996
I got to go.

502
00:21:35,064 --> 00:21:38,066
- When?
- Last night.

503
00:21:38,134 --> 00:21:39,534
What are we gonna do?

504
00:21:39,602 --> 00:21:42,037
We've got no choice.

505
00:21:42,104 --> 00:21:45,874
We have to leave the country.
What?

506
00:21:45,942 --> 00:21:47,943
I can get us two tickets
to Buenos Aires

507
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:50,245
and have the chopper
on the helipad in ten minutes.

508
00:21:50,313 --> 00:21:52,047
Wait. She knows?
And you know she knows?

509
00:21:52,114 --> 00:21:54,015
And you're joking about my life?
What the hell is wrong with you?

510
00:21:54,083 --> 00:21:56,251
- Are you mad at me?
- No, I want to kill you!

511
00:21:56,319 --> 00:21:58,353
Good, because if you're mad,
that means you're not panicking.

512
00:21:58,421 --> 00:22:01,089
Now calm the hell down.

513
00:22:05,594 --> 00:22:08,463
Okay, what did she say?

514
00:22:08,531 --> 00:22:11,433
- She told me to fire you.
- That's not calming me down.

515
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,585
Haven't I taught you that
there's more than one response

516
00:22:13,586 --> 00:22:14,955
when someone has a gun
to your head?

517
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:16,999
Right now there's
not even a gun in here.

518
00:22:17,306 --> 00:22:18,406
No, no. It's not in here.

519
00:22:18,474 --> 00:22:19,774
It's out there roaming
the halls.

520
00:22:19,842 --> 00:22:21,409
And when it sees me,
it's gonna start shooting.

521
00:22:21,477 --> 00:22:22,978
Weren't you supposed
to give that plaintiff

522
00:22:23,045 --> 00:22:25,447
the Harvey Specter treatment?
Yes.

523
00:22:25,514 --> 00:22:27,549
- Did you wrap it up?
- I'm working on it.

524
00:22:27,616 --> 00:22:29,384
That means you didn't give her
the Harvey Specter treatment.

525
00:22:29,452 --> 00:22:32,020
So why don't you go do your job
and have some goddamn faith

526
00:22:32,088 --> 00:22:33,688
that I'll do mine?
Donna, not now.

527
00:22:33,756 --> 00:22:34,789
Oh, you're gonna want
to hear this.

528
00:22:34,857 --> 00:22:36,091
What?

529
00:22:36,158 --> 00:22:37,325
Alicia Hardman died last night.

530
00:22:37,393 --> 00:22:39,527
Hard as in Pearson Hardman?

531
00:22:39,595 --> 00:22:42,430
- Wife. Is it public yet?
- No.

532
00:22:42,498 --> 00:22:43,865
When were you going
to tell me she knew, Harvey?

533
00:22:43,933 --> 00:22:47,302
I wasn't.

534
00:22:48,738 --> 00:22:50,005
- Jessica.
- Louis.

535
00:22:50,072 --> 00:22:51,606
- How are you?
- Never better. You?

536
00:22:51,674 --> 00:22:54,409
Top of the world.

537
00:22:54,477 --> 00:22:56,845
- Did you need me?
- No.

538
00:22:56,912 --> 00:22:59,681
But I do have something that...
will make you happy.

539
00:22:59,749 --> 00:23:01,116
Oh. Fire away.

540
00:23:01,183 --> 00:23:02,784
Well, as you know,
I've been compiling a list

541
00:23:02,852 --> 00:23:04,419
of redundant departments
for the Swinton merger.

542
00:23:04,487 --> 00:23:05,920
You should also think
about compiling a list

543
00:23:05,988 --> 00:23:08,723
of redundant departments
for the Swinton merger.

544
00:23:08,791 --> 00:23:10,625
That is awesome.

545
00:23:10,693 --> 00:23:12,060
Anyway, I thought
you'd be happy to know

546
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:15,230
that I, uh,
assigned it to Mike Ross.

547
00:23:15,297 --> 00:23:17,232
Excellent. When?

548
00:23:17,299 --> 00:23:18,500
Just now.

549
00:23:18,567 --> 00:23:19,868
Harvey mentioned your dinner,
and I knew

550
00:23:19,935 --> 00:23:21,403
that was an indicator
of you being very fond...

551
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:23,271
Louis, it's one
of the things I love about you.

552
00:23:23,339 --> 00:23:25,273
You get me. I do.

553
00:23:25,341 --> 00:23:26,841
Yes.

554
00:23:26,909 --> 00:23:29,978
Oh, I forgot something.
You go ahead, all right?

555
00:23:30,046 --> 00:23:32,614
And Louis, thank you.

556
00:23:32,681 --> 00:23:35,417
Sure.

557
00:23:44,827 --> 00:23:46,594
What the hell
is wrong with you?

558
00:23:46,662 --> 00:23:50,465
Not here.

559
00:23:52,134 --> 00:23:54,202
No.

560
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:55,804
You think I don't know
what you're doing?

561
00:23:55,871 --> 00:23:57,472
I know you know what I did.

562
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:59,340
You baited Louis
into working with Ross,

563
00:23:59,408 --> 00:24:00,608
so if he leaves abruptly,

564
00:24:00,676 --> 00:24:02,444
Louis will
start asking questions.

565
00:24:02,511 --> 00:24:04,746
I said I knew you knew.
Now you're just showing off.

566
00:24:04,814 --> 00:24:06,047
You think I'm gonna
let you get away with it?

567
00:24:06,115 --> 00:24:09,551
I think we've got bigger fish
to fry.

568
00:24:12,588 --> 00:24:14,355
Alicia Hardman's dead.

569
00:24:14,423 --> 00:24:17,192
Which means Daniel Hardman's
coming back.

570
00:24:17,259 --> 00:24:18,560
You don't know that.

571
00:24:18,627 --> 00:24:20,328
Yes, I do. And so do you.

572
00:24:20,396 --> 00:24:22,330
No, you're just using
this situation

573
00:24:22,398 --> 00:24:24,232
to get Mike Ross out
of the crosshairs.

574
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:27,435
Need I remind you that
the only reason we were able

575
00:24:27,503 --> 00:24:28,803
to get rid of the other half
of Pearson Hardman

576
00:24:28,871 --> 00:24:30,672
in the first place
was by threatening

577
00:24:30,739 --> 00:24:32,740
to tell her about his affair?

578
00:24:32,808 --> 00:24:34,142
That was the means,
not the end.

579
00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:35,844
We had a good reason,
and you know that.

580
00:24:35,911 --> 00:24:37,112
That's not my point.

581
00:24:37,179 --> 00:24:40,115
Alicia's dead.
Our leverage is gone.

582
00:24:40,182 --> 00:24:42,183
That was five years ago.

583
00:24:42,251 --> 00:24:43,685
A lot can happen in five years.

584
00:24:43,752 --> 00:24:45,053
And what Daniel Hardman's
been doing

585
00:24:45,121 --> 00:24:46,221
for the last five years

586
00:24:46,288 --> 00:24:48,590
is dreaming of the day
he comes back

587
00:24:48,657 --> 00:24:52,827
and screws us both
out of our jobs.

588
00:24:52,895 --> 00:24:53,728
There's an easy way
to find out.

589
00:24:53,796 --> 00:24:55,363
Then let's do it.

590
00:24:55,431 --> 00:24:58,233
'Cause I can tell you this,
that asshole's coming back.

591
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:01,436
And he isn't coming because
he wants to be number two.

592
00:25:07,458 --> 00:25:09,359
I got to say, he looks good.

593
00:25:09,427 --> 00:25:11,662
Being a prick
keeps you handsome.

594
00:25:11,729 --> 00:25:13,597
Are you saying
that I'm handsome?

595
00:25:13,665 --> 00:25:15,532
The fact that you think that
comment was directed at you

596
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,268
makes you self-centered and vain
at the same time.

597
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:20,037
Doesn't mean
it wasn't directed at me.

598
00:25:20,104 --> 00:25:21,705
It was.

599
00:25:21,773 --> 00:25:24,274
Which means
I'm also omniscient.

600
00:25:24,342 --> 00:25:25,409
And handsome.

601
00:25:25,476 --> 00:25:27,544
You left out arrogant.

602
00:25:27,612 --> 00:25:29,880
You know, you and Daniel
are cut from the same cloth.

603
00:25:29,948 --> 00:25:31,782
That's why I don't like him.

604
00:25:31,849 --> 00:25:33,850
"There can be only one."

605
00:25:33,918 --> 00:25:36,353
We're at a funeral,
and you're quoting <i>Highlander?</i>

606
00:25:36,421 --> 00:25:37,454
Yeah,
a lot of people die in it.

607
00:25:37,522 --> 00:25:39,790
Seems appropriate.

608
00:25:39,857 --> 00:25:42,759
You know the one key difference
between the two of us?

609
00:25:42,827 --> 00:25:44,628
He's a lying snake in the grass

610
00:25:44,696 --> 00:25:46,964
who'll say or do anything.

611
00:25:55,273 --> 00:25:57,474
Mr. Ross,

612
00:25:57,542 --> 00:25:58,842
the truth is I don't remember

613
00:25:58,910 --> 00:26:00,444
where the James Jenkins pitch
came from.

614
00:26:00,511 --> 00:26:02,579
Then it could have come
from Myra.

615
00:26:02,647 --> 00:26:04,081
Well, it could have,
but it doesn't matter.

616
00:26:04,148 --> 00:26:06,750
Even if I had stolen it, she
signed the employee agreement.

617
00:26:06,818 --> 00:26:08,752
Which gives Drecker Publishing
the rights to her work product.

618
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:10,053
Yes, I know.

619
00:26:10,121 --> 00:26:11,421
Well, then you also know
I'm not going

620
00:26:11,489 --> 00:26:13,523
to taint my company's reputation
by giving Myra credit.

621
00:26:13,591 --> 00:26:15,359
I'm not asking you
to give her credit.

622
00:26:15,426 --> 00:26:17,027
I'm asking you
to give her compensation

623
00:26:17,095 --> 00:26:18,862
in exchange for a confidential
settlement agreement,

624
00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:21,898
which protects your reputation.

625
00:26:21,966 --> 00:26:24,267
That sounds like blackmail.

626
00:26:24,335 --> 00:26:27,804
Ms. Beckman.

627
00:26:27,872 --> 00:26:29,139
This lawsuit is the only thing

628
00:26:29,207 --> 00:26:30,641
holding up
a billion-dollar merger.

629
00:26:30,708 --> 00:26:32,109
And every day that it drags on,

630
00:26:32,176 --> 00:26:33,644
it's costing your company
more money.

631
00:26:33,711 --> 00:26:35,445
What I'm talking about

632
00:26:35,513 --> 00:26:38,181
is giving Myra Harrison
a crumb of a crumb.

633
00:26:38,249 --> 00:26:40,083
So stop worrying
about what it sounds like,

634
00:26:40,151 --> 00:26:43,153
and start writing a check.

635
00:26:43,221 --> 00:26:46,056
How much is it gonna cost?

636
00:26:46,124 --> 00:26:48,592
That's what I want to hear.

637
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:50,560
Just look at 'em.

638
00:26:50,628 --> 00:26:53,096
Sycophants. It makes me sick.

639
00:26:53,164 --> 00:26:54,731
I'm not gonna stand in line
for the privilege

640
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:56,833
of kissing Daniel Hardman's ass,
and neither are you.

641
00:26:56,901 --> 00:26:59,136
- It's a funeral.
- The man was a slave driver.

642
00:26:59,203 --> 00:27:00,971
All he ever did was shit on me

643
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:02,539
and make me work long hours
for him.

644
00:27:02,607 --> 00:27:04,207
I mean,
where was the kind word?

645
00:27:04,275 --> 00:27:06,376
You know, the tiny gesture?
Yeah, I don't think so.

646
00:27:06,444 --> 00:27:08,412
- To be fair, it's not...
- Zip it, I'm talking.

647
00:27:08,479 --> 00:27:10,747
And then he just ups and leaves,
you know?

648
00:27:10,815 --> 00:27:13,283
To take care of his dying wife.

649
00:27:13,351 --> 00:27:16,420
So?
I'm not waiting in line, okay?

650
00:27:16,487 --> 00:27:18,088
I'm not gonna give the guy
the satisfaction.

651
00:27:18,156 --> 00:27:20,157
What I meant was
now that she's dead,

652
00:27:20,224 --> 00:27:24,461
does that mean
that he's coming back?

653
00:27:24,529 --> 00:27:26,530
Actually, this line looks
like it's flowing.

654
00:27:26,597 --> 00:27:29,066
And you're not com... no.
What is that?

655
00:27:29,133 --> 00:27:32,002
- That's my, uh, cancer ribbon.
- No, I know what it is.

656
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:33,704
Why are you wearing it?

657
00:27:33,771 --> 00:27:35,906
Well, I wanted to show
my support for Mrs. Hardman.

658
00:27:35,973 --> 00:27:38,241
It's what she died of,
and I-I also had this aunt

659
00:27:38,309 --> 00:27:39,743
that, um, she...

660
00:27:46,918 --> 00:27:48,685
$30,000.

661
00:27:48,753 --> 00:27:51,021
That is a lot of money.
Yeah, it is.

662
00:27:51,089 --> 00:27:53,957
It's as much as they've ever
paid for a freelance pitch.

663
00:27:54,025 --> 00:27:55,525
But those people
also got credit,

664
00:27:55,593 --> 00:27:58,462
which helped them sell
their next idea for more.

665
00:27:58,529 --> 00:27:59,763
I thought you said
you were worried

666
00:27:59,831 --> 00:28:02,265
you'd never have
another good idea.

667
00:28:02,333 --> 00:28:03,967
Myra, this is...

668
00:28:04,035 --> 00:28:05,669
this is the best deal
you're going to get.

669
00:28:05,737 --> 00:28:07,738
I'm not exactly sure
that's true.

670
00:28:07,805 --> 00:28:11,775
No, trust me, it is.

671
00:28:11,843 --> 00:28:13,610
You said you're
in the middle of a merger

672
00:28:13,678 --> 00:28:15,278
and that I'm an inconvenience.

673
00:28:15,346 --> 00:28:18,014
I did my research.
It's a huge merger.

674
00:28:18,082 --> 00:28:20,917
- I told you that to help you.
- You told me that to bully me.

675
00:28:20,985 --> 00:28:23,420
- You only tried to help later.
- And I succeeded.

676
00:28:23,488 --> 00:28:26,990
Which is why you have a check
for $30,000 in your hands.

677
00:28:27,058 --> 00:28:29,259
Do you believe
that was my idea?

678
00:28:29,327 --> 00:28:31,561
I know you do.
That's why you agreed to help.

679
00:28:31,629 --> 00:28:34,164
- What's your point?
- My point is...

680
00:28:34,232 --> 00:28:37,434
Lesley was my boss,
but I thought we were friends.

681
00:28:37,502 --> 00:28:41,071
So when she asked me
to trust her, I did.

682
00:28:41,139 --> 00:28:42,572
And she betrayed me.

683
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:46,877
Can you imagine
what that would be like?

684
00:28:57,388 --> 00:28:59,790
Got to say,
up close, I feel bad for him.

685
00:28:59,857 --> 00:29:03,827
Just don't forget
why we're here.

686
00:29:03,895 --> 00:29:05,228
Daniel.

687
00:29:05,296 --> 00:29:07,430
I'm sorry for your loss.

688
00:29:07,498 --> 00:29:08,832
Thank you.

689
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:10,267
Harvey.

690
00:29:10,334 --> 00:29:12,469
My condolences.

691
00:29:12,537 --> 00:29:14,437
Doesn't sound the same,
coming from you.

692
00:29:14,505 --> 00:29:16,273
You have my sympathy
for your wife,

693
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:18,775
but I don't pretend
this is page one of the story.

694
00:29:18,843 --> 00:29:20,577
You must think I hate you both.

695
00:29:20,645 --> 00:29:22,612
Well, that might have
something to do with the fact

696
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:25,115
that I was listening
the last time you spoke to me.

697
00:29:25,183 --> 00:29:27,584
I was pissed, wasn't I?

698
00:29:27,652 --> 00:29:28,919
You threw your phone
at my head.

699
00:29:28,986 --> 00:29:30,520
I did miss though.

700
00:29:30,588 --> 00:29:31,988
That's because
you throw like a girl.

701
00:29:32,056 --> 00:29:34,558
You're still angry, Harvey,
and I don't blame you.

702
00:29:34,625 --> 00:29:36,793
But what you don't understand

703
00:29:36,861 --> 00:29:40,230
is the last five years
have changed everything for me.

704
00:29:40,298 --> 00:29:43,200
How so?

705
00:29:43,267 --> 00:29:45,068
I reconnected with Alicia.

706
00:29:45,136 --> 00:29:47,304
I cared for her.

707
00:29:47,371 --> 00:29:51,942
I know you can't get back
lost time with your family,

708
00:29:52,009 --> 00:29:55,779
but you can make up for it.

709
00:29:55,847 --> 00:29:57,647
Look at Sarah.

710
00:29:57,715 --> 00:30:00,917
I never really knew her,
and now I do.

711
00:30:00,985 --> 00:30:03,486
Last time I saw her,
she was a little girl.

712
00:30:03,554 --> 00:30:05,422
She just graduated high school.

713
00:30:05,489 --> 00:30:08,558
Going to Harvard, this fall.

714
00:30:08,626 --> 00:30:10,527
The truth is...

715
00:30:10,595 --> 00:30:11,862
what you did <i>to</i> me

716
00:30:11,929 --> 00:30:14,731
was the best thing
anyone could have done for me.

717
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:17,868
That mean you're coming back?

718
00:30:17,935 --> 00:30:21,238
It's my wife's funeral, Harvey.

719
00:30:21,305 --> 00:30:23,940
I haven't given it
any real thought yet.

720
00:30:27,812 --> 00:30:28,979
I am a changed man, Jessica.

721
00:30:29,046 --> 00:30:31,815
And I have you to thank for it.

722
00:30:34,919 --> 00:30:36,786
You actually buying
that pious bullshit?

723
00:30:36,854 --> 00:30:38,188
Not for a second.

724
00:30:38,256 --> 00:30:39,723
He's coming for us.

725
00:30:39,790 --> 00:30:42,325
I can stop him before
he even gets through the door.

726
00:30:42,393 --> 00:30:44,227
I don't see how you're gonna
be able to do that.

727
00:30:44,295 --> 00:30:47,264
I'll have extra motivation.

728
00:30:47,331 --> 00:30:49,799
- You want the kid to stay.
- Yes.

729
00:30:49,867 --> 00:30:52,469
Like I said,
cut from the same cloth.

730
00:30:52,536 --> 00:30:54,838
Make it happen.

731
00:30:54,906 --> 00:30:57,674
You've got yourself a deal.

732
00:31:07,033 --> 00:31:09,201
Why haven't I been notified
that my merger's closing?

733
00:31:09,269 --> 00:31:11,837
Uh, the plaintiff's refusing
to settle without credit.

734
00:31:11,905 --> 00:31:13,205
What happened
to steamrolling her?

735
00:31:13,273 --> 00:31:15,174
She realized that she's
in a unique position

736
00:31:15,241 --> 00:31:16,508
to hold up the merger.

737
00:31:16,576 --> 00:31:18,410
How the hell
did she realize that?

738
00:31:18,478 --> 00:31:20,412
Oh, no, wait. Don't tell me.

739
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,581
You fell in love with her,
and then you told her.

740
00:31:22,649 --> 00:31:24,316
No, I did not fall
in love with her,

741
00:31:24,384 --> 00:31:27,052
but... yeah, I believe her.

742
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,588
- You're kidding me.
- What?

743
00:31:29,656 --> 00:31:30,956
I'm fighting for your job,

744
00:31:31,024 --> 00:31:32,424
and you're gonna screw up
this merger?

745
00:31:32,492 --> 00:31:35,093
- Are you?
- Am I what?

746
00:31:35,161 --> 00:31:37,462
Fighting for my job.

747
00:31:37,530 --> 00:31:39,631
Because if you're not,
this is gonna be my last case,

748
00:31:39,699 --> 00:31:40,732
and I'm not sure
I want to go down

749
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,201
fighting for the wrong side.

750
00:31:42,268 --> 00:31:43,702
What makes you think
I'm not fighting for you?

751
00:31:43,770 --> 00:31:46,538
Mm, I don't know.
Your career... my anything.

752
00:31:46,606 --> 00:31:48,207
Oh, you got a lot of nerve.

753
00:31:48,274 --> 00:31:50,576
You have no idea
what I've been doing for you.

754
00:31:50,643 --> 00:31:51,877
Maybe. But you and I both know

755
00:31:51,945 --> 00:31:55,080
you were gonna fire me
the other day, don't we?

756
00:31:55,148 --> 00:31:57,416
Don't answer that.
I can see the look on your face.

757
00:31:57,483 --> 00:31:59,151
It's the same look
I can see in here,

758
00:31:59,219 --> 00:32:01,620
from that morning,
clear as a bell.

759
00:32:01,688 --> 00:32:03,121
What I was going to do
and what I did

760
00:32:03,189 --> 00:32:04,790
aren't the same thing.

761
00:32:04,857 --> 00:32:06,525
Like the first day I met you,

762
00:32:06,593 --> 00:32:08,594
when you were gonna deal drugs
and you didn't.

763
00:32:08,661 --> 00:32:10,062
Look, I can't tell you

764
00:32:10,129 --> 00:32:12,030
everything that's going on here,
all right?

765
00:32:12,098 --> 00:32:14,132
But you have to trust me.

766
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:17,569
You are not getting fired
on my watch.

767
00:32:21,507 --> 00:32:23,108
I trust you.

768
00:32:23,176 --> 00:32:25,410
Then stop worrying
about what side you're on,

769
00:32:25,478 --> 00:32:28,714
and take care of that lawsuit.

770
00:32:31,451 --> 00:32:32,784
Hey, Rachel,
do you have a minute?

771
00:32:32,852 --> 00:32:34,086
- I need to...
- No, I don't.

772
00:32:34,153 --> 00:32:35,454
Got your message
loud and clear.

773
00:32:35,521 --> 00:32:37,889
- Wait. What?
- Look, I'm not mad.

774
00:32:37,957 --> 00:32:39,424
I'm just in the middle
of a lot of work right now.

775
00:32:39,492 --> 00:32:41,793
So if you're looking
for a friend, I...

776
00:32:41,861 --> 00:32:46,465
I just really don't have
the time. Sorry.

777
00:32:46,532 --> 00:32:49,401
What message?

778
00:32:56,075 --> 00:32:58,143
You must really be
needing some love.

779
00:32:58,211 --> 00:32:59,778
Why do you say that?

780
00:32:59,846 --> 00:33:05,083
Those cookies are from
the Eisenhower administration.

781
00:33:05,151 --> 00:33:07,786
You know...

782
00:33:07,854 --> 00:33:10,122
sometimes...

783
00:33:10,189 --> 00:33:12,057
sometimes I wish
I could go back.

784
00:33:12,125 --> 00:33:13,659
To when?

785
00:33:13,726 --> 00:33:17,629
Before... it.

786
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:22,267
When I was little,

787
00:33:22,335 --> 00:33:23,669
I used to sit
with my grandmother

788
00:33:23,736 --> 00:33:25,704
whenever I was upset.

789
00:33:25,772 --> 00:33:28,273
A mother loves you,
but a grandmother...

790
00:33:28,341 --> 00:33:30,075
Always on your side.

791
00:33:30,143 --> 00:33:32,210
Do you remember
that time that I...

792
00:33:32,278 --> 00:33:34,613
Ran away to your place?

793
00:33:34,681 --> 00:33:37,049
You were so mad
they wouldn't let you stay up

794
00:33:37,116 --> 00:33:38,850
to watch <i>The Cosby Show.</i>

795
00:33:38,918 --> 00:33:41,153
I know.
It's so unreasonable, right?

796
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:42,821
But you were six.

797
00:33:42,889 --> 00:33:45,090
You took me in,
told me that story...

798
00:33:45,158 --> 00:33:46,792
the time you ran away
from your parents.

799
00:33:46,859 --> 00:33:50,829
Yeah, I ended up getting found
by some dock workers

800
00:33:50,897 --> 00:33:52,064
3 miles from the house.

801
00:33:52,131 --> 00:33:55,133
Yeah, that's the one.

802
00:33:55,201 --> 00:33:58,537
- Never happened.
- What?

803
00:33:58,604 --> 00:34:01,640
I just wanted to make you
miss your mom and dad.

804
00:34:01,708 --> 00:34:04,643
I basically told you
<i>Hansel and Gretel.</i>

805
00:34:04,711 --> 00:34:07,079
What? No.
It ends so differently.

806
00:34:07,146 --> 00:34:08,847
I added some touches.

807
00:34:08,915 --> 00:34:10,482
You wouldn't have bought

808
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:13,585
me getting eaten
by the dock workers.

809
00:34:13,653 --> 00:34:15,487
You were six,
you weren't an imbecile.

810
00:34:15,555 --> 00:34:18,490
There is nothing new un...

811
00:34:18,558 --> 00:34:20,826
under the sun.

812
00:34:20,893 --> 00:34:22,861
What?

813
00:34:22,929 --> 00:34:25,697
I suddenly feel so much better.

814
00:34:25,765 --> 00:34:29,167
Thank you. Mwah!

815
00:34:29,235 --> 00:34:31,570
Oh, and is there anything else
you haven't been telling me?

816
00:34:31,637 --> 00:34:33,038
Like, am I from Krypton?

817
00:34:33,106 --> 00:34:35,374
Possible.

818
00:34:51,958 --> 00:34:54,059
Hi. Harvey Specter.

819
00:34:54,127 --> 00:34:55,861
I'm Sarah.

820
00:34:55,928 --> 00:34:58,830
Um, I saw you talking
to my father at the service.

821
00:34:58,898 --> 00:35:00,031
We used to work together.

822
00:35:00,099 --> 00:35:02,000
Did you know my mom?

823
00:35:02,068 --> 00:35:04,770
Not as well
as I would have liked.

824
00:35:04,837 --> 00:35:07,406
Um, I was just going out.

825
00:35:07,473 --> 00:35:09,541
I need a walk.

826
00:35:09,609 --> 00:35:11,076
Dad's just over there.

827
00:35:11,144 --> 00:35:13,578
I'm sure he'll be happy
to see you.

828
00:35:13,646 --> 00:35:16,081
I'm sorry for your loss.

829
00:35:16,149 --> 00:35:19,985
Thank you.

830
00:35:25,825 --> 00:35:27,859
Will you excuse me
for one second?

831
00:35:27,927 --> 00:35:29,661
- Mm-hmm.
- Thanks.

832
00:35:33,065 --> 00:35:34,599
Harvey?

833
00:35:34,667 --> 00:35:36,034
You brought food.

834
00:35:36,102 --> 00:35:38,036
New York's finest.

835
00:35:38,104 --> 00:35:39,471
You didn't want
to come empty-handed.

836
00:35:39,539 --> 00:35:40,972
I didn't want to come here
at all.

837
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:43,809
But you want to make sure
I don't come back.

838
00:35:43,876 --> 00:35:46,178
When we found out
about your little scam,

839
00:35:46,245 --> 00:35:48,613
I wanted to go public.
Jessica said no.

840
00:35:48,681 --> 00:35:50,749
Didn't want
to damage the firm's reputation.

841
00:35:50,817 --> 00:35:52,451
She always was
a strategic thinker.

842
00:35:52,518 --> 00:35:54,719
But you've been gone
a long time.

843
00:35:54,787 --> 00:35:57,055
Now when we tell everyone
what you were up to,

844
00:35:57,123 --> 00:35:59,391
our reputation will be fine,
yours won't.

845
00:35:59,459 --> 00:36:00,826
As I said before,

846
00:36:00,893 --> 00:36:04,529
I haven't decided
what the future holds for me.

847
00:36:04,597 --> 00:36:07,365
And all your little threat
is doing is...

848
00:36:07,433 --> 00:36:10,035
making me want to come back.

849
00:36:10,102 --> 00:36:13,505
When I was growing up,
I had a friend who found out

850
00:36:13,573 --> 00:36:15,874
that his mother never loved
his father.

851
00:36:15,942 --> 00:36:18,577
She cheated on him their
whole marriage, then left him.

852
00:36:18,644 --> 00:36:20,612
He never forgave her.

853
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:22,914
If you come back,
here's what's gonna happen.

854
00:36:22,982 --> 00:36:26,585
Your daughter's gonna find out
what kind man her father is.

855
00:36:26,652 --> 00:36:27,786
Everything.

856
00:36:27,854 --> 00:36:29,754
You think I won't do that?

857
00:36:29,822 --> 00:36:33,492
I will.

858
00:36:33,559 --> 00:36:35,260
Why are you doing this?

859
00:36:35,328 --> 00:36:39,431
To protect my own.

860
00:36:39,499 --> 00:36:43,335
Do us all a favor
and set up shop somewhere else.

861
00:36:53,179 --> 00:36:54,279
It's done.

862
00:36:54,347 --> 00:36:56,348
He won't be coming back.

863
00:36:56,415 --> 00:36:58,750
Think I figured out a way
to get everybody what they want.

864
00:36:58,818 --> 00:37:01,987
Well, that's good.

865
00:37:02,054 --> 00:37:03,288
What's she doing here?

866
00:37:03,356 --> 00:37:05,423
Well, she's here
to get what she wants.

867
00:37:05,491 --> 00:37:07,225
Which is what, exactly?

868
00:37:07,293 --> 00:37:09,594
- Credit.
- That's all Myra's looking for.

869
00:37:09,662 --> 00:37:11,763
So just admit that
you remember the pitch

870
00:37:11,831 --> 00:37:13,431
and that you know what you did.

871
00:37:13,499 --> 00:37:15,867
I have no intention of doing
that because it's not true.

872
00:37:15,935 --> 00:37:17,836
So you'd be willing
to take a lie-detector test

873
00:37:17,904 --> 00:37:19,104
to that effect, then?

874
00:37:19,171 --> 00:37:21,973
I most certainly will not.

875
00:37:22,041 --> 00:37:24,242
And I don't appreciate
being spoken to like this

876
00:37:24,310 --> 00:37:25,844
by my own counsel.

877
00:37:25,912 --> 00:37:27,846
Well, the thing is, Lesley,
that Myra's not the only one

878
00:37:27,914 --> 00:37:30,015
who signed an agreement
with Drecker Publishing.

879
00:37:30,082 --> 00:37:31,316
So did you.

880
00:37:31,384 --> 00:37:32,784
And that agreement
gives them the right

881
00:37:32,852 --> 00:37:35,020
to terminate you if you refuse
to submit to a polygraph.

882
00:37:35,087 --> 00:37:37,889
And I happen to represent them,
not you.

883
00:37:41,394 --> 00:37:42,427
I took it.

884
00:37:42,495 --> 00:37:44,563
- Hmm.
- I was under the gun.

885
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:45,864
I was entitled to it,
so I took it.

886
00:37:45,932 --> 00:37:48,433
You offered me advice,
and I trusted you.

887
00:37:48,501 --> 00:37:50,268
She's threatened by you, Myra.

888
00:37:50,336 --> 00:37:52,370
Not a good choice of mentor.

889
00:37:52,438 --> 00:37:55,874
Now look,
you got the credit you wanted...

890
00:37:55,942 --> 00:37:58,843
so sign the deal.

891
00:37:58,911 --> 00:38:01,646
No, I want public credit.
Not credit in here.

892
00:38:01,714 --> 00:38:04,649
This doesn't do me any good.
I thought you might say that.

893
00:38:04,717 --> 00:38:08,286
Which is why I have spent
the last 24 hours

894
00:38:08,354 --> 00:38:11,556
scanning the entire
Drecker Publishing catalog.

895
00:38:11,624 --> 00:38:13,792
Robert Fallow,

896
00:38:13,859 --> 00:38:16,294
Jonathan Daken,

897
00:38:16,362 --> 00:38:20,198
and, my personal favorite,
Lester Collins.

898
00:38:20,266 --> 00:38:21,566
Any one of them
could have been written

899
00:38:21,634 --> 00:38:23,234
on the basis of your pitch.

900
00:38:23,302 --> 00:38:26,671
But they weren't because they
were written years before it.

901
00:38:26,739 --> 00:38:28,406
Are you saying
I plagiarized them?

902
00:38:28,474 --> 00:38:32,410
I'm... I'm saying there's
nothing new under the sun.

903
00:38:32,478 --> 00:38:34,879
Now I suggest you sign that deal
and go home.

904
00:38:34,947 --> 00:38:36,348
Otherwise
we're gonna countersue

905
00:38:36,415 --> 00:38:38,917
for plagiarizing your pitch
from our previous works.

906
00:38:38,985 --> 00:38:40,218
But it's not true.

907
00:38:40,286 --> 00:38:42,153
It's no less legitimate
than claiming

908
00:38:42,221 --> 00:38:43,755
we stole something
you gave us the rights to.

909
00:38:43,823 --> 00:38:46,257
And, more importantly,
it puts you over a barrel,

910
00:38:46,325 --> 00:38:48,860
which is where you think
you have us.

911
00:39:01,474 --> 00:39:02,641
Myra.

912
00:39:02,708 --> 00:39:04,309
You want to be writer?

913
00:39:04,377 --> 00:39:06,244
Then write.

914
00:39:06,312 --> 00:39:10,015
But don't ever threaten me
or my firm again.

915
00:39:16,541 --> 00:39:18,442
- You look happy.
- I am happy.

916
00:39:18,509 --> 00:39:21,378
- Anything I should know?
- Welcome to Pearson Hardman.

917
00:39:21,446 --> 00:39:24,514
Anything I should know?

918
00:39:24,582 --> 00:39:25,616
Settled the case.

919
00:39:25,683 --> 00:39:27,084
Merger paperwork's on the way.

920
00:39:27,151 --> 00:39:28,585
You slammed the plaintiff?

921
00:39:28,653 --> 00:39:30,087
- Oh, I slammed everybody.
- That's I like to hear.

922
00:39:33,558 --> 00:39:36,159
When I ran Pearson Hardman...

923
00:39:36,227 --> 00:39:41,131
I was charming, witty
and adorable.

924
00:39:43,134 --> 00:39:46,003
I was also unscrupulous...

925
00:39:46,070 --> 00:39:48,105
power-hungry and greedy.

926
00:39:48,172 --> 00:39:50,340
I thought I could get away
with anything.

927
00:39:50,408 --> 00:39:51,541
And that's exactly
what I tried to do.

928
00:39:51,609 --> 00:39:53,176
I risked the firm's reputation

929
00:39:53,244 --> 00:39:56,947
and the careers
of everyone in it.

930
00:39:57,015 --> 00:40:01,018
These last few years
have humbled me.

931
00:40:01,085 --> 00:40:02,719
And I've decided to come back

932
00:40:02,787 --> 00:40:04,454
and show that we can be
a successful law firm

933
00:40:04,522 --> 00:40:07,357
without breaking the rules.

934
00:40:07,425 --> 00:40:09,526
Unfortunately,
the only way that I can do that

935
00:40:09,594 --> 00:40:12,629
is by coming clean
about my past.

936
00:40:12,697 --> 00:40:16,867
Because if we are busy hiding
what we have done...

937
00:40:16,935 --> 00:40:18,669
it leaves us vulnerable

938
00:40:18,736 --> 00:40:21,004
to anyone
who discovers our secrets.

939
00:40:21,072 --> 00:40:25,776
And we become so consumed
with keeping them,

940
00:40:25,843 --> 00:40:29,479
that it is a slippery slope
to doing even worse things.

941
00:40:29,547 --> 00:40:32,115
While I was head of this firm,

942
00:40:32,183 --> 00:40:37,254
I borrowed funds
from various escrow accounts.

943
00:40:37,322 --> 00:40:38,922
The clients never found out
about it.

944
00:40:38,990 --> 00:40:40,123
I paid back every cent.

945
00:40:40,191 --> 00:40:41,558
But make no mistake,

946
00:40:41,626 --> 00:40:43,393
I could have been convicted
of theft,

947
00:40:43,461 --> 00:40:44,995
plain and simple.

948
00:40:45,063 --> 00:40:50,033
I want everyone here
to know the kind of man I was.

949
00:40:50,101 --> 00:40:53,603
And the kind of man I am.

950
00:40:53,671 --> 00:40:56,373
Thank you.

951
00:41:00,678 --> 00:41:01,912
Go home now.

952
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:04,815
Don't come back.

953
00:41:08,586 --> 00:41:12,522
You and I
are gonna have a talk.

954
00:41:12,590 --> 00:41:16,059
I understand why
you had Harvey do what he did.

955
00:41:16,127 --> 00:41:18,528
But I'm not the same person.

956
00:41:18,596 --> 00:41:20,864
And the only way
that I could think to prove it

957
00:41:20,932 --> 00:41:24,134
was by doing what I just did.

958
00:41:24,202 --> 00:41:27,004
I told my daughter everything.

959
00:41:27,071 --> 00:41:30,707
I hope we can figure out a way
to work together.

960
00:41:38,449 --> 00:41:41,018
Didn't think you'd have
the guts to show up.

961
00:41:41,085 --> 00:41:42,519
- What do you want?
- What do I want?

962
00:41:42,587 --> 00:41:44,454
I want to know how my best
friend could do this to me.

963
00:41:44,522 --> 00:41:46,690
Do what to you? Huh?

964
00:41:46,758 --> 00:41:48,425
Betray you?
Go behind your back?

965
00:41:48,493 --> 00:41:51,762
I stood there joking with you...
my friend, my buddy.

966
00:41:51,829 --> 00:41:56,033
And my girlfriend was
in your shower, three feet away.

967
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:57,968
Hope you two
had a good laugh about that.

968
00:41:58,036 --> 00:41:59,436
I was gonna tell you, Trevor.

969
00:41:59,504 --> 00:42:01,838
But you didn't.

970
00:42:01,906 --> 00:42:03,874
And I wasn't gonna tell Jenny
about Rachel,

971
00:42:03,941 --> 00:42:05,409
but I did.

972
00:42:05,476 --> 00:42:06,943
How'd you even know
about me and Rachel?

973
00:42:07,011 --> 00:42:08,111
You know what?

974
00:42:08,179 --> 00:42:09,479
You're so smart,
you figure it out.

975
00:42:09,547 --> 00:42:11,815
Okay, yeah, you got me.
Jenny broke up with me.

976
00:42:11,883 --> 00:42:16,319
But you went to my boss.
You tried to ruin my life.

977
00:42:16,387 --> 00:42:18,622
We're even.

978
00:42:18,689 --> 00:42:23,860
990-36-7249.

979
00:42:23,928 --> 00:42:26,396
It's your
social security number, right?

980
00:42:26,464 --> 00:42:29,032
I saw it on your dad's desk
when we were in the sixth grade.

981
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:32,469
See, you think
that you can mess with my life,

982
00:42:32,537 --> 00:42:35,105
and I can't mess with yours,
but I can.

983
00:42:35,173 --> 00:42:36,907
The only thing
that's stopped me until now

984
00:42:36,974 --> 00:42:38,608
is the fact
that I actually cared about you.

985
00:42:38,676 --> 00:42:40,010
But now, after this,

986
00:42:40,078 --> 00:42:43,980
I really don't give a shit
about you anymore.

987
00:42:44,048 --> 00:42:48,051
You might not have my memory,
but you better remember that.

988
00:42:55,526 --> 00:42:57,094
What the hell did you say
to Daniel?

989
00:42:57,161 --> 00:42:58,628
Does it matter?

990
00:42:58,696 --> 00:42:59,863
What matters
is I don't ever want

991
00:42:59,931 --> 00:43:01,398
to see Mike Ross
in this office again.

992
00:43:01,466 --> 00:43:04,835
- Well, that's not gonna happen.
- Excuse me?

993
00:43:04,902 --> 00:43:06,770
I'm not firing him.

994
00:43:06,838 --> 00:43:09,072
Then I'll fire him.

995
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:10,407
No, you won't.

996
00:43:10,475 --> 00:43:12,476
You said you gave me
the benefit of the doubt

997
00:43:12,543 --> 00:43:15,145
that I didn't know about Mike,
otherwise you'd fire me too.

998
00:43:19,250 --> 00:43:21,017
Well, I knew.

999
00:43:21,085 --> 00:43:23,620
You trying to force my hand?

1000
00:43:23,688 --> 00:43:24,654
I'm trying to stay your hand.

1001
00:43:24,722 --> 00:43:27,791
He goes, I go.

1002
00:43:27,859 --> 00:43:31,061
Pack up your things.
You're done.

1003
00:43:31,129 --> 00:43:33,063
There's only one problem
with that.

1004
00:43:33,131 --> 00:43:34,965
Daniel's coming for your job.

1005
00:43:35,032 --> 00:43:36,766
If I leave now,

1006
00:43:36,834 --> 00:43:38,802
he'll smell something's wrong,
he'll figure out what it is.

1007
00:43:38,870 --> 00:43:40,137
You'll look reckless

1008
00:43:40,204 --> 00:43:42,172
for letting me hire a kid
without a degree,

1009
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:44,341
or foolish
for not knowing I did it.

1010
00:43:44,408 --> 00:43:46,343
Neither quality being an asset
in a managing partner.

1011
00:43:46,410 --> 00:43:47,511
Which makes you vulnerable.

1012
00:43:47,578 --> 00:43:49,045
All because you hired

1013
00:43:49,113 --> 00:43:50,514
the goddamn kid
in the first place.

1014
00:43:50,581 --> 00:43:53,750
Be that as it may,
he'll use it against you.

1015
00:43:53,818 --> 00:43:55,852
You need me.

1016
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:57,921
And I'm not staying
without Mike.

1017
00:44:27,385 --> 00:44:29,886
Hey, Mike, it's Rachel.

1018
00:44:29,954 --> 00:44:31,388
I know I shouldn't be
doing this,

1019
00:44:31,455 --> 00:44:33,356
and I-I know
you're seeing Jenny,

1020
00:44:33,424 --> 00:44:36,026
but I can't stop thinking
about the kiss.

1021
00:44:36,093 --> 00:44:38,361
And... I can't go back.

1022
00:44:41,966 --> 00:44:45,302
- Hello...
- Get your ass in here.

1023
00:44:45,369 --> 00:44:47,637
On my way.

1024
00:45:15,132 --> 00:45:19,169
I thought...

1025
00:45:19,237 --> 00:45:20,570
Harvey said
he wanted to see me.

1026
00:45:20,638 --> 00:45:22,205
He said,
"Get your ass in here."

1027
00:45:22,273 --> 00:45:24,307
Am I fired?

1028
00:45:24,375 --> 00:45:27,744
You should be.

1029
00:45:27,812 --> 00:45:29,446
That imply that I'm not?

1030
00:45:29,513 --> 00:45:31,147
Not necessarily.

1031
00:45:31,215 --> 00:45:35,485
However, if I'm going
to accept this situation...

1032
00:45:35,553 --> 00:45:38,655
then I want to know everything
there is to know.

1033
00:45:38,723 --> 00:45:40,857
Okay.

1034
00:45:40,925 --> 00:45:41,992
Where do I start?

1035
00:45:42,059 --> 00:45:43,526
Why don't you tell me

1036
00:45:43,594 --> 00:45:46,630
how the hell you got Harvey
to hire you in the first place.

1037
00:45:46,697 --> 00:45:49,933
Fire up that laptop
and I'll show you.

1038
00:45:50,001 --> 00:45:53,436
Ask me anything there is
to know about the law.

1039
00:45:53,504 --> 00:45:56,339
That's how you did it?

1040
00:45:56,407 --> 00:46:01,177
