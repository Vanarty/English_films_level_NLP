1
00:01:19,825 --> 00:01:21,702
On the clothes we wear,

2
00:01:21,994 --> 00:01:23,829
the people who make these clothes,

3
00:01:24,037 --> 00:01:26,498
and the impact it is having on our world.

4
00:01:29,751 --> 00:01:32,296
It is a story about greed and fear,

5
00:01:32,588 --> 00:01:34,339
power and poverty.

6
00:01:35,465 --> 00:01:38,927
It is complex, because it extends throughout the world.

7
00:01:39,261 --> 00:01:40,554
But it is also simple,

8
00:01:40,929 --> 00:01:44,349
revealing how connected we are to the many hearts and hands

9
00:01:44,516 --> 00:01:45,851
behind our clothes.

10
00:01:51,481 --> 00:01:54,359
I went into this story without having any experience in fashion,

11
00:01:54,651 --> 00:01:57,279
starting with only a few simple questions.

12
00:01:57,779 --> 00:01:59,239
What I've discovered,

13
00:01:59,406 --> 00:02:02,201
It has forever changed how I think about the clothes I wear,

14
00:02:02,618 --> 00:02:07,080
and my hope is that you do the same thing happen.

15
00:02:19,927 --> 00:02:22,221
Perhaps you can begin by saying your name

16
00:02:22,387 --> 00:02:25,224
and he is talking about how it was that started this.

17
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:26,725
My name is Lucy Siegle.

18
00:02:26,892 --> 00:02:30,270
I am a journalist and presenter based in the UK,

19
00:02:30,437 --> 00:02:34,024
and I've been obsessed, consumed

20
00:02:34,191 --> 00:02:38,529
the environmental and social impacts of the fashion industry

21
00:02:38,737 --> 00:02:40,572
for about a decade.

22
00:02:40,864 --> 00:02:43,242
I like everything from clothing.

23
00:02:43,408 --> 00:02:46,119
I love poetry, I love the fabric,

24
00:02:46,286 --> 00:02:48,247
I love the colors, textures,

25
00:02:48,413 --> 00:02:50,749
I love how you feel.

26
00:02:50,916 --> 00:02:53,710
It is the skin that we choose.

27
00:02:54,127 --> 00:02:58,423
Well, I had the classic huge closet,

28
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:00,050
clothes everywhere,

29
00:03:00,217 --> 00:03:03,095
bags continually coming into my house,

30
00:03:03,262 --> 00:03:05,556
every day, every other day with another item

31
00:03:05,722 --> 00:03:07,182
and I never had anything to wear.

32
00:03:07,349 --> 00:03:11,019
I could never put together a coherent whole.

33
00:03:13,355 --> 00:03:15,315
We communicate who we are

34
00:03:15,482 --> 00:03:17,192
to some extent through clothing.

35
00:03:17,359 --> 00:03:19,903
This is, again, throughout history.

36
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:21,822
We trends in court,

37
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:25,242
and Marie Antoinette with these huge hats.

38
00:03:25,409 --> 00:03:28,996
It has always been our personal communication in many ways.

39
00:03:29,162 --> 00:03:31,039
That's what interests me,

40
00:03:31,206 --> 00:03:35,544
which it is essentially part of what we want to communicate

41
00:03:35,711 --> 00:03:36,751
about ourselves.

42
00:03:42,926 --> 00:03:45,429
We used to have a system, a system of fashion

43
00:03:45,596 --> 00:03:47,639
where people went to the parades,

44
00:03:47,806 --> 00:03:50,309
so did spring, summer, autumn, winter,

45
00:03:50,475 --> 00:03:53,228
and it worked like clockwork for many years.

46
00:03:53,395 --> 00:03:55,689
Well, forget it, throw it out the window.

47
00:03:55,856 --> 00:03:59,443
That has absolutely nothing to do with today's fashion industry.

48
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:01,570
It has been reinvented.

49
00:04:01,904 --> 00:04:04,990
The change moves ruthlessly

50
00:04:06,116 --> 00:04:09,536
to a way of producing

51
00:04:09,703 --> 00:04:13,999
actually only deals

52
00:04:14,499 --> 00:04:16,502
the interests of big business.

53
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:20,506
Young, she did not give much importance

54
00:04:20,672 --> 00:04:23,175
anything other than the price of buying clothes,

55
00:04:23,342 --> 00:04:26,220
usually choosing in the style or a good deal.

56
00:04:26,762 --> 00:04:29,056
Looking back, I knew for a long time

57
00:04:29,223 --> 00:04:32,142
most of our clothes are made here in the United States.

58
00:04:32,476 --> 00:04:36,605
As recently as the '60s, still we did 95% of our clothes.

59
00:04:37,314 --> 00:04:39,733
Today, we only about 3%

60
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,777
and the other 97% is outsourced

61
00:04:41,944 --> 00:04:43,862
in developing countries worldwide.

62
00:04:49,618 --> 00:04:52,246
I have been in business for over nine years.

63
00:04:52,412 --> 00:04:54,873
In terms of scale, we have about 25 000 people

64
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,792
only what is manufacturing garments.

65
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:00,254
We produce one of every six shirts sold in the US. UU.

66
00:05:02,631 --> 00:05:04,216
If you go to a store,

67
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:08,595
and compare the price of an item in the last 20 years,

68
00:05:08,762 --> 00:05:11,765
you will discover that there are actually deflation product

69
00:05:11,932 --> 00:05:13,809
that is, the price has dropped over time.

70
00:05:13,976 --> 00:05:16,562
Now, our costs have decreased? Absolutely.

71
00:05:16,728 --> 00:05:18,272
Our costs have gone up.

72
00:05:19,147 --> 00:05:20,858
The more we have outsourced production,

73
00:05:21,024 --> 00:05:23,694
have become cheaper prices of clothes we buy,

74
00:05:23,861 --> 00:05:27,239
I give way to an entirely new model, known as Fast Fashion,

75
00:05:27,489 --> 00:05:31,827
the overnight, transforming how the clothes are bought and sold.

76
00:05:32,119 --> 00:05:35,122
The latest H & M store on 5th Avenue in Manhattan

77
00:05:35,289 --> 00:05:37,124
It is the largest in the history of the company,

78
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:39,918
and one of the many new stores planned in the country.

79
00:05:40,085 --> 00:05:42,629
This is part of a revolution in trade,

80
00:05:42,796 --> 00:05:43,796
Fast Fashion.

81
00:05:43,797 --> 00:05:45,257
Instead of two seasons per year,

82
00:05:45,424 --> 00:05:47,926
practically we have 52 seasons a year.

83
00:05:48,093 --> 00:05:50,345
So we have something new every week.

84
00:05:50,512 --> 00:05:52,931
And fast fashion has created this,

85
00:05:53,098 --> 00:05:55,767
primarily to sell more products.

86
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:06,695
We love TopShop!

87
00:06:06,862 --> 00:06:10,657
You can get this metallic fringed skirt for $ 39 at Joe Fresh

88
00:06:10,824 --> 00:06:12,075
a new store in the city.

89
00:06:12,242 --> 00:06:15,954
With a little more attractive to cost-conscious buyers prices.

90
00:06:16,121 --> 00:06:20,334
American consumers fully captured fashion H & M,

91
00:06:20,501 --> 00:06:22,669
and we already know that Americans

92
00:06:22,836 --> 00:06:24,213
They are very price oriented.

93
00:06:24,379 --> 00:06:26,924
If you combine these two together, with fashion and price,

94
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:28,175
then you have the recipe.

95
00:06:28,342 --> 00:06:30,886
A Japanese clothing retailer is leaving

96
00:06:31,053 --> 00:06:33,931
fast and furious mark here in the US. UU.

97
00:06:34,097 --> 00:06:35,557
The price has dropped.

98
00:06:35,724 --> 00:06:39,937
The way to do that product has changed completely.

99
00:06:40,103 --> 00:06:42,231
And at some point one must ask:

100
00:06:42,397 --> 00:06:43,732
"Where does it end?"

101
00:06:43,899 --> 00:06:45,859
The global market is a place

102
00:06:46,026 --> 00:06:48,570
we export the work to be performed

103
00:06:48,737 --> 00:06:50,697
in any conditions we want,

104
00:06:50,864 --> 00:06:52,366
products and then come back to me,

105
00:06:52,533 --> 00:06:55,244
so cheap you can throw without thinking about it.

106
00:06:55,619 --> 00:06:58,121
JOHN HILARY, DIRECTOR EJECUTIVO
DE WAR ON WANT

107
00:06:58,288 --> 00:07:00,832
Globalized production basically means

108
00:07:00,999 --> 00:07:02,709
that all manufacturing of goods

109
00:07:02,876 --> 00:07:05,879
It has been outsourced to low-cost economies,

110
00:07:06,046 --> 00:07:09,550
particularly where wages are very low and remain low.

111
00:07:09,716 --> 00:07:13,512
And what that means is that those at the top of the value chain,

112
00:07:13,679 --> 00:07:16,557
They can choose where products are made,

113
00:07:16,723 --> 00:07:20,143
and may change if, for example, a factory says:

114
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:22,104
"We can not do it so cheap."

115
00:07:22,271 --> 00:07:24,773
The brand will say, "Well, no longer will go to you.

116
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:27,568
Let's move to another site that is cheaper. "

117
00:07:32,739 --> 00:07:35,450
Dacca, Bangladesh

118
00:07:36,159 --> 00:07:39,580
In the West they say: "everyday low prices".

119
00:07:39,746 --> 00:07:41,748
So, every day, causing me difficulties

120
00:07:41,915 --> 00:07:44,418
and he caused them to my employees, and it works.

121
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:46,753
Competing stores are competing there.

122
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:50,424
When stores come to us for ordering and negotiate,

123
00:07:50,591 --> 00:07:52,759
They tell us: "Look, that particular store

124
00:07:52,926 --> 00:07:55,596
this shirt is selling for $ 5,

125
00:07:55,804 --> 00:07:58,265
so I have to sell it at $ 4.

126
00:07:58,599 --> 00:08:00,142
You'll have to reduce your price. "

127
00:08:00,309 --> 00:08:01,309
So we reduce it.

128
00:08:01,351 --> 00:08:02,811
Then comes another store saying:

129
00:08:02,978 --> 00:08:04,980
"Hey, they are selling it at $ 4.

130
00:08:05,147 --> 00:08:07,566
The target price is $ 3, if you can do it for $ 3,

131
00:08:07,733 --> 00:08:10,152
You get the business, otherwise you do not get it ".

132
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,696
As desperately we want the business,

133
00:08:12,863 --> 00:08:15,699
and we have no other options, okay.

134
00:08:15,866 --> 00:08:18,869
We are always trying to survive, actually.

135
00:08:19,494 --> 00:08:21,413
In the end, something ends up giving.

136
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:23,582
Or the product price has to rise

137
00:08:23,749 --> 00:08:26,960
or manufacturers have to close,

138
00:08:27,169 --> 00:08:28,962
or cut costs to operate.

139
00:08:29,421 --> 00:08:32,007
Cut costs and ignore safety measures

140
00:08:32,174 --> 00:08:35,302
It was accepted as part of doing business in this new model,

141
00:08:35,469 --> 00:08:37,095
until one morning in April,

142
00:08:37,262 --> 00:08:39,640
when an event, on the outskirts of Dhaka, Bangladesh,

143
00:08:39,806 --> 00:08:42,434
It took a hidden side of fashion headlines.

144
00:08:42,601 --> 00:08:44,394
State media in Bangladesh

145
00:08:44,561 --> 00:08:48,232
say an eight-story building collapsed near the capital Dhaka,

146
00:08:48,398 --> 00:08:50,275
killing more than 70 people.

147
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:04,289
Rescue crews work around the clock,

148
00:09:04,456 --> 00:09:06,875
looking through the rubble, trying to find

149
00:09:07,042 --> 00:09:09,253
many survivors as possible.

150
00:09:09,419 --> 00:09:10,796
They have hundreds dead,

151
00:09:10,963 --> 00:09:12,923
hundreds still may be buried alive,

152
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:14,508
and officials in Bangladesh say

153
00:09:14,675 --> 00:09:17,427
the factory owners ignored the order to evacuate.

154
00:09:17,636 --> 00:09:21,807
400 dead, yet it is believed that hundreds are missing.

155
00:09:21,974 --> 00:09:26,061
Garment workers in Bangladesh pay the price of cheap clothes.

156
00:09:26,478 --> 00:09:29,356
A large crowd has gathered near the building,

157
00:09:29,523 --> 00:09:32,693
many families searching for their loved ones,

158
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:35,779
and they say you can still hear people screaming

159
00:09:35,946 --> 00:09:39,074
under the rubble, crying for help.

160
00:09:39,241 --> 00:09:41,702
Many are simply losing hope.

161
00:09:43,203 --> 00:09:45,289
From where he was working,

162
00:09:45,455 --> 00:09:48,625
I approached the stairs.

163
00:09:49,001 --> 00:09:50,794
When I got them

164
00:09:50,961 --> 00:09:53,839
the building collapsed and my legs were trapped.

165
00:09:55,716 --> 00:09:59,052
The side walls fell on my legs.

166
00:10:00,721 --> 00:10:05,934
I realized that I could not get my legs, I gave up.

167
00:10:06,143 --> 00:10:11,690
I came to mind hundreds of thoughts.

168
00:10:11,899 --> 00:10:14,651
I could not even mourn.

169
00:10:16,653 --> 00:10:19,573
Anyone who, like me,

170
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:23,619
I had written about the problems in the supply chain,

171
00:10:23,785 --> 00:10:25,621
particularly for Fast Fashion,

172
00:10:25,787 --> 00:10:27,831
and he tried to articulate

173
00:10:27,998 --> 00:10:31,543
how he was moving risk

174
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:35,547
the most vulnerable and lowest paid.

175
00:10:36,465 --> 00:10:39,718
You try to articulate it, but you could never imagine

176
00:10:39,885 --> 00:10:42,971
that there would be so catastrophic illustration

177
00:10:43,138 --> 00:10:45,265
what you were trying to say.

178
00:10:45,432 --> 00:10:49,520
And Rana Square for me was like a horror story.

179
00:10:49,978 --> 00:10:51,980
Two weeks after the disaster,

180
00:10:52,147 --> 00:10:56,318
and the death toll amounts to the shocking figure of 931,

181
00:10:56,485 --> 00:10:59,988
making it the worst disaster textile history.

182
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:04,409
I think one of the most deeply impressive things

183
00:11:04,576 --> 00:11:08,413
Rana on disaster Square was the news

184
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:11,917
the workers had already pointed to the direction

185
00:11:12,084 --> 00:11:13,877
cracks in the building.

186
00:11:14,044 --> 00:11:15,462
They had already noted

187
00:11:15,629 --> 00:11:18,131
that the building was structurally unsafe,

188
00:11:18,298 --> 00:11:20,425
and yet they were forced to re-enter.

189
00:11:20,843 --> 00:11:22,469
Many survivors wonder

190
00:11:22,636 --> 00:11:24,638
how they could be forced to return to work

191
00:11:24,805 --> 00:11:28,141
when management knew the cracks in the building,

192
00:11:28,308 --> 00:11:31,395
and concerns of workers on the day of the collapse.

193
00:11:31,854 --> 00:11:35,107
Many clothes in US stores is made in Bangladesh

194
00:11:35,274 --> 00:11:37,985
by workers who earn about $ 2 a day.

195
00:11:38,277 --> 00:11:41,071
Last month, a textile factory collapsed,

196
00:11:41,321 --> 00:11:43,407
killing more than 1,000 people,

197
00:11:43,574 --> 00:11:48,704
and a few months before, a fire in a factory left more than 100 dead.

198
00:11:48,871 --> 00:11:51,582
And as bodies are recovered from the rubble,

199
00:11:51,748 --> 00:11:54,585
another factory in Bangladesh this morning caught fire,

200
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:55,961
leaving eight dead.

201
00:11:56,879 --> 00:11:59,464
Disaster stories in garment factories

202
00:11:59,631 --> 00:12:00,757
They monopolized the news,

203
00:12:00,924 --> 00:12:03,969
the fact is that now three of the four worst tragedies

204
00:12:04,136 --> 00:12:07,764
in fashion history they had occurred in the past year.

205
00:12:08,182 --> 00:12:11,435
While growing death toll amounted profits generated.

206
00:12:11,602 --> 00:12:13,812
The following year disaster Rana Square,

207
00:12:13,979 --> 00:12:16,940
It was the most profitable sector for all time.

208
00:12:17,441 --> 00:12:18,734
The global fashion industry

209
00:12:18,901 --> 00:12:22,112
It is now an annual industry nearly three trillion dollars.

210
00:12:22,321 --> 00:12:24,364
Bangladesh is already the second largest

211
00:12:24,531 --> 00:12:27,034
exporter of clothing after China.

212
00:12:27,201 --> 00:12:29,870
How? Well, unlike some of its competitors,

213
00:12:30,037 --> 00:12:32,998
Bangladeshi manufacturing is still very cheap,

214
00:12:33,165 --> 00:12:35,501
and unions have limited power.

215
00:12:35,667 --> 00:12:40,297
The country grabbed the lower end of the value chain.

216
00:12:40,631 --> 00:12:45,010
1000 Those poor girls, were killed

217
00:12:45,177 --> 00:12:50,307
because no one cared, no one will give a shit.

218
00:12:50,474 --> 00:12:53,268
Just they wanted cheap price and good profit.

219
00:12:53,435 --> 00:12:54,770
It should not be.

220
00:12:54,937 --> 00:12:57,981
Everyone should take responsibility for these girls.

221
00:13:03,153 --> 00:13:04,446
it's like that.

222
00:13:06,073 --> 00:13:07,491
It could happen again.

223
00:13:07,658 --> 00:13:11,870
Sorry, but it's not just the price pressure.

224
00:13:12,037 --> 00:13:13,247
It is something ...

225
00:13:13,413 --> 00:13:15,123
It is to ignore the lives of others.

226
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:18,377
It's not ... should not ... it's not right.

227
00:13:18,544 --> 00:13:20,420
We are in the XXI century.

228
00:13:20,671 --> 00:13:22,297
We live in a global world,

229
00:13:22,464 --> 00:13:25,092
And just we ignore the lives of others?

230
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,385
How it is possible?

231
00:13:26,552 --> 00:13:30,556
This huge and predatory industry

232
00:13:30,722 --> 00:13:32,975
which it is generating many benefits

233
00:13:33,141 --> 00:13:34,935
for a handful of people,

234
00:13:35,435 --> 00:13:37,563
Why is unable

235
00:13:37,729 --> 00:13:41,275
to support their million workers properly?

236
00:13:41,441 --> 00:13:45,571
Why you are not able to ensure their safety?

237
00:13:45,737 --> 00:13:47,739
We are talking about basic human rights.

238
00:13:47,906 --> 00:13:49,825
Why is unable to ensure that

239
00:13:49,992 --> 00:13:52,953
while it is generating these huge profits?

240
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,038
Is it because it does not work properly?

241
00:13:55,205 --> 00:13:56,331
That is my question.

242
00:13:57,958 --> 00:14:00,502
Lucy's question sounds like the most obvious.

243
00:14:00,669 --> 00:14:03,714
But instead of answering, wherever I looked, I found people

244
00:14:03,881 --> 00:14:05,799
constantly justify the cost

245
00:14:05,966 --> 00:14:08,385
by economic benefits generated.

246
00:14:08,677 --> 00:14:12,764
So this production of low wages, so-called "sweatshops"

247
00:14:12,931 --> 00:14:15,601
is not only the least bad option for the workers,

248
00:14:15,767 --> 00:14:18,812
It is part of a process that raises living standards

249
00:14:18,979 --> 00:14:22,357
and leads to higher wages and better working conditions wages.

250
00:14:22,524 --> 00:14:26,904
The immediate causes of development are physical capital, technology

251
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:29,281
and human capital and worker skills.

252
00:14:29,448 --> 00:14:31,116
When they workshops to those countries,

253
00:14:31,283 --> 00:14:33,952
the three elements bring these workers

254
00:14:34,119 --> 00:14:35,954
and begin to put that process in motion.

255
00:14:36,121 --> 00:14:39,458
Can sweatshops be really good?

256
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:41,460
Yes, those terrible, horrible workshops.

257
00:14:41,627 --> 00:14:43,420
The very name "sweatshop"

258
00:14:43,587 --> 00:14:46,340
conjures up horrific images of poor people and children,

259
00:14:46,507 --> 00:14:50,177
suffering in Third World countries, enslaved in appalling conditions

260
00:14:50,344 --> 00:14:53,138
making products for us, selfish Americans.

261
00:14:53,305 --> 00:14:55,140
And thanks. Good!

262
00:14:55,307 --> 00:14:59,102
Does it bother me that people are working in a factory,

263
00:14:59,269 --> 00:15:02,814
making clothes for Americans,

264
00:15:02,981 --> 00:15:04,900
or European?

265
00:15:05,067 --> 00:15:07,736
Or they are ... What so spend their lives?

266
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,739
Is that what you're asking?

267
00:15:10,906 --> 00:15:12,699
Yeah right.

268
00:15:14,284 --> 00:15:17,329
No. I mean, they are doing work.

269
00:15:18,205 --> 00:15:20,332
They could be doing much worse.

270
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:22,543
This is live television, and ask

271
00:15:22,709 --> 00:15:24,086
defining the sweatshops.

272
00:15:24,253 --> 00:15:25,546
We must be very clear

273
00:15:25,712 --> 00:15:27,381
what we talked about at the beginning.

274
00:15:27,548 --> 00:15:30,259
We're talking about places with poor working conditions

275
00:15:30,425 --> 00:15:32,803
from the standpoint of normal Americans,

276
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:36,056
low wages for our level, places where children work,

277
00:15:36,223 --> 00:15:38,225
that can violate the labor law of the country,

278
00:15:38,392 --> 00:15:40,269
but there are key characteristics of the type,

279
00:15:40,435 --> 00:15:42,479
of which I want to talk tonight, Kennedy,

280
00:15:42,646 --> 00:15:45,148
And there are places where people choose to work,

281
00:15:45,315 --> 00:15:47,818
certainly a number of other bad choices.

282
00:15:48,151 --> 00:15:50,487
I mean, there is nothing inherently dangerous

283
00:15:50,654 --> 00:15:51,738
in sewing clothes.

284
00:15:51,905 --> 00:15:53,740
Then we started

285
00:15:53,907 --> 00:15:57,244
with a relatively safe industry.

286
00:15:57,411 --> 00:16:00,247
It's not like coal mining, mining or natural gas,

287
00:16:00,414 --> 00:16:03,750
or a lot of things I could ... that are much more dangerous.

288
00:16:03,917 --> 00:16:08,005
Work on these workshops seem horrible working conditions and salaries

289
00:16:08,172 --> 00:16:10,507
for anyone in the West who have enough money

290
00:16:10,674 --> 00:16:13,051
to have a TV and watch your video.

291
00:16:13,218 --> 00:16:15,888
But we must remember that the alternatives available

292
00:16:16,054 --> 00:16:18,307
for these workers are not our alternatives.

293
00:16:18,473 --> 00:16:20,309
They are much worse than our alternatives,

294
00:16:20,475 --> 00:16:21,768
and they are usually much worse

295
00:16:21,935 --> 00:16:24,015
who work in its factory worker.

296
00:16:24,646 --> 00:16:28,650
Low wages, unsafe conditions and disasters in factories

297
00:16:28,817 --> 00:16:31,320
They are justified by the need to create jobs

298
00:16:31,486 --> 00:16:33,572
for people without alternatives.

299
00:16:33,906 --> 00:16:36,074
This story has become the narrative,

300
00:16:36,241 --> 00:16:39,119
used to explain how the fashion industry now

301
00:16:39,286 --> 00:16:40,412
Worldwide.

302
00:16:40,579 --> 00:16:42,206
But there are those who believe

303
00:16:42,372 --> 00:16:43,999
there must be a better way

304
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:45,417
to manufacture and sell clothing

305
00:16:45,584 --> 00:16:47,544
generating economic growth,

306
00:16:47,711 --> 00:16:49,963
but causing havoc.

307
00:16:50,547 --> 00:16:52,716
So I do not know yet

308
00:16:52,883 --> 00:16:54,635
how long has this embroidery.

309
00:16:54,801 --> 00:16:57,888
Do you think you can ask about Santo ...?

310
00:16:58,055 --> 00:17:00,265
How long has that whole panel?

311
00:17:00,432 --> 00:17:03,018
I guess because it was then seen in the breakdown of press FAB,

312
00:17:03,185 --> 00:17:04,686
but it will be great to know, right?

313
00:17:04,937 --> 00:17:08,565
Safia Minney am. I am the founder and CEO of People Tree,

314
00:17:09,024 --> 00:17:11,568
and People Tree is a fashion brand of fair trade,

315
00:17:11,735 --> 00:17:14,363
It began over 20 years ago in Japan.

316
00:17:14,821 --> 00:17:16,782
We worried that we had too navy.

317
00:17:16,949 --> 00:17:17,949
How about now?

318
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:20,160
Because we put more black in PV14

319
00:17:20,327 --> 00:17:22,496
and it worked very, very well

320
00:17:22,663 --> 00:17:26,750
in collaboration with Orla design.

321
00:17:26,917 --> 00:17:29,670
Do we have enough prints in black in the collection?

322
00:17:30,128 --> 00:17:34,758
Well, we've lost that abstract print dust, east of here,

323
00:17:35,008 --> 00:17:37,886
in black, but I think this pink, really ...

324
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,429
It is one of those prints

325
00:17:39,596 --> 00:17:42,266
I worry a bit but all work well.

326
00:17:43,267 --> 00:17:45,310
I think most fashion brands

327
00:17:45,477 --> 00:17:48,939
They start with a concept of a collection or style.

328
00:17:49,857 --> 00:17:52,609
Not often think:

329
00:17:53,652 --> 00:17:54,987
"Who is going to make the product?

330
00:17:55,153 --> 00:17:59,074
And I can make sure how manufacturers,

331
00:17:59,241 --> 00:18:02,327
or suppliers are going to eat? "

332
00:18:02,703 --> 00:18:04,788
So what we try to do in People Tree

333
00:18:04,955 --> 00:18:07,916
it really started with the capabilities we have

334
00:18:08,083 --> 00:18:11,253
in each group of manufacturers, and then design the collection,

335
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:14,339
while we look at the integrity of the collection

336
00:18:14,506 --> 00:18:15,632
in aesthetics.

337
00:18:16,925 --> 00:18:19,761
Originally I worked with independent designers

338
00:18:19,928 --> 00:18:23,932
and I went to Bangladesh, Zimbabwe, India, Nepal, Philippines,

339
00:18:24,099 --> 00:18:27,811
and gradually we put together an incredible network

340
00:18:27,978 --> 00:18:31,023
of FTOs minded

341
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:33,734
for the development of women,

342
00:18:33,901 --> 00:18:36,612
social development for workers and the environment

343
00:18:36,778 --> 00:18:39,072
They are absolutely essential in everything we do.

344
00:18:39,948 --> 00:18:43,493
TOKYO, JAPAN

345
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:46,163
One two three.

346
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:49,249
Happy World Fair Trade Day!

347
00:18:54,004 --> 00:18:58,300
Today is the 15th anniversary

348
00:18:58,467 --> 00:19:00,677
World Fair Trade.

349
00:19:00,844 --> 00:19:04,473
We organize this type of event

350
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,975
in over 60 countries

351
00:19:07,142 --> 00:19:10,270
as Fair Trade movement,

352
00:19:10,437 --> 00:19:12,898
and 10 to 60 organizations

353
00:19:13,065 --> 00:19:16,068
by country participate in it.

354
00:19:16,235 --> 00:19:20,155
Today, as we do here,

355
00:19:20,322 --> 00:19:24,576
are being held fashion shows and seminars

356
00:19:24,743 --> 00:19:29,456
in more than 3,000 locations worldwide.

357
00:19:56,483 --> 00:20:00,779
Good job! It was so ... really great!

358
00:20:10,122 --> 00:20:13,750
Could you turn the body over to me a little more?

359
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:18,046
That is beautiful.

360
00:20:18,255 --> 00:20:20,716
Fair trade is the public response

361
00:20:20,883 --> 00:20:22,634
to correct social injustice

362
00:20:22,801 --> 00:20:26,138
in a system of international trade that is largely dysfunctional,

363
00:20:26,305 --> 00:20:29,183
where workers and farmers

364
00:20:29,349 --> 00:20:31,977
They do not receive a living wage,

365
00:20:32,144 --> 00:20:35,355
and where the environment is not considered at all

366
00:20:35,522 --> 00:20:37,482
to make the products we buy every day.

367
00:20:37,649 --> 00:20:40,360
Dacca, Bangladesh

368
00:20:52,581 --> 00:20:54,124
My name is Shima.

369
00:20:54,291 --> 00:20:56,835
I am 23 years old.

370
00:20:57,002 --> 00:21:00,589
When I came to Dhaka, I was twelve.

371
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:08,472
Shima is one of the

372
00:21:08,639 --> 00:21:11,433
40 million workers in textile factories in the world.

373
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,311
Nearly 4 million of those workers are here in Bangladesh,

374
00:21:14,478 --> 00:21:16,730
working in almost five thousand factories,

375
00:21:16,897 --> 00:21:19,149
making clothes for major Western brands.

376
00:21:21,401 --> 00:21:23,570
Over 85% of these workers are women.

377
00:21:23,904 --> 00:21:26,740
And with a minimum wage of less than $ 3 a day,

378
00:21:26,907 --> 00:21:29,785
They are among the lowest paid in the world textile workers.

379
00:21:29,952 --> 00:21:34,498
When I came to Dhaka, I stayed with my aunt.

380
00:21:34,665 --> 00:21:36,834
When I started working in a garment factory,

381
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,418
my salary was $ 10 a month.

382
00:21:59,565 --> 00:22:01,108
How is it called?

383
00:22:01,275 --> 00:22:03,861
¿Mi hija? Nadia Akhter

384
00:22:10,158 --> 00:22:12,369
I take with me to the factory a few days

385
00:22:12,536 --> 00:22:14,371
but it is terribly hot in the factory.

386
00:22:14,538 --> 00:22:18,375
And there are chemicals inside the factory

387
00:22:18,584 --> 00:22:23,130
which they are very harmful to children.

388
00:22:23,422 --> 00:22:25,966
So I can not have you here with me in Dhaka

389
00:22:26,133 --> 00:22:29,052
because I have no one to look after her.

390
00:22:36,268 --> 00:22:41,356
Workers should not have any kind of distrust

391
00:22:41,523 --> 00:22:43,275
of their owners.

392
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:45,360
If they do,

393
00:22:46,069 --> 00:22:50,824
there will be a good working environment at the factory.

394
00:22:51,283 --> 00:22:56,538
Must respect, the owner pays us according to the rules.

395
00:22:57,873 --> 00:22:59,875
If you do not have this kind of confidence,

396
00:23:00,042 --> 00:23:01,710
You will not get the result.

397
00:23:02,669 --> 00:23:05,047
I have formed a union at work.

398
00:23:05,214 --> 00:23:08,634
I have been the president of the union since its formation.

399
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:13,972
We present a list of demands and principals received it.

400
00:23:14,139 --> 00:23:18,477
Then they received the list, had an altercation with the directors.

401
00:23:18,644 --> 00:23:23,148
After the altercation, managers closed the door.

402
00:23:23,315 --> 00:23:27,736
And along with them, 30-40 employees attacked us

403
00:23:27,903 --> 00:23:29,821
and they beat us.

404
00:23:29,988 --> 00:23:33,492
They used chairs, sticks, scales

405
00:23:33,659 --> 00:23:37,538
and things like scissors to beat.

406
00:23:37,704 --> 00:23:41,708
Especially they kicked and punched

407
00:23:41,875 --> 00:23:45,921
and they beat his head against the walls.

408
00:23:46,088 --> 00:23:49,258
They beat us especially

409
00:23:49,424 --> 00:23:53,679
chest and abdomen.

410
00:23:56,557 --> 00:23:59,184
It is estimated that one in six people alive

411
00:23:59,351 --> 00:24:00,435
in the world today,

412
00:24:00,602 --> 00:24:03,355
working on some of the world's fashion industry,

413
00:24:03,605 --> 00:24:06,817
so it is more dependent on the world labor sector.

414
00:24:07,401 --> 00:24:11,196
Most of this work is done by people like Shima, voiceless

415
00:24:11,363 --> 00:24:13,240
in the wider supply chain.

416
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:15,325
But to better understand the impact

417
00:24:15,492 --> 00:24:16,869
that fashion has in the world,

418
00:24:17,035 --> 00:24:19,705
we must return to where it all begins.

419
00:24:24,585 --> 00:24:27,546
My grandparents came here in the 20s,

420
00:24:27,713 --> 00:24:29,089
and this is part of my heritage.

421
00:24:29,256 --> 00:24:31,258
I wonder why organic cotton growing,

422
00:24:31,425 --> 00:24:32,634
because I can not do otherwise.

423
00:24:32,801 --> 00:24:34,511
My grandfather was an old German farmer

424
00:24:34,678 --> 00:24:36,471
I thought that we should respect the earth,

425
00:24:36,638 --> 00:24:37,931
We are stewards of the earth,

426
00:24:38,098 --> 00:24:39,808
and respect the life on earth.

427
00:24:42,144 --> 00:24:45,230
We're actually sitting in the High Plains of Texas

428
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:49,276
and there are 1.2 million hectares of cotton growing in this region.

429
00:24:49,484 --> 00:24:52,070
It is literally the largest plot of cotton in the world.

430
00:24:52,446 --> 00:24:56,283
Only in the last ten years, 80% is now GM cotton,

431
00:24:56,450 --> 00:24:58,327
genetically modified.

432
00:24:58,577 --> 00:25:01,121
Most is Roundup Ready,

433
00:25:01,288 --> 00:25:04,958
meaning that farmers instead of spraying weeds,

434
00:25:05,125 --> 00:25:06,376
occasionally in their field,

435
00:25:06,543 --> 00:25:09,755
or hire laborers to go for the field by removing weeds,

436
00:25:09,922 --> 00:25:12,966
They are now spraying entire fields.

437
00:25:13,175 --> 00:25:14,676
The cotton fiber is

438
00:25:14,843 --> 00:25:16,345
from which most of the clothes are made

439
00:25:16,512 --> 00:25:17,888
used by the world today.

440
00:25:18,055 --> 00:25:20,015
And while growing our appetite for fashion,

441
00:25:20,182 --> 00:25:23,227
cotton plant itself is redesigned to keep pace.

442
00:25:23,519 --> 00:25:25,187
There has been this big push

443
00:25:25,354 --> 00:25:27,814
towards industrialization of agriculture,

444
00:25:27,981 --> 00:25:30,025
the intensification of agriculture.

445
00:25:30,192 --> 00:25:32,528
So instead of old crop types

446
00:25:32,694 --> 00:25:35,072
they were very in tune with nature,

447
00:25:35,239 --> 00:25:37,115
They were related to the cycles

448
00:25:37,282 --> 00:25:39,868
the calendar year, and seasons.

449
00:25:40,035 --> 00:25:41,828
What you see now is a stepping

450
00:25:41,995 --> 00:25:44,581
where land is almost reconsidered

451
00:25:44,748 --> 00:25:45,788
like a factory.

452
00:25:47,292 --> 00:25:50,379
What has been created is the general practice

453
00:25:50,546 --> 00:25:54,591
of "we are trying million hectares alike."

454
00:25:54,758 --> 00:25:57,761
We put a dose of chemical especially

455
00:25:57,928 --> 00:26:01,390
and that's when these great ecological effects are obtained

456
00:26:01,723 --> 00:26:04,935
and nobody has any idea what is really happening.

457
00:26:05,811 --> 00:26:09,940
Nature tends to heal in small areas.

458
00:26:10,691 --> 00:26:14,444
But when there is this large and comprehensive approach,

459
00:26:16,238 --> 00:26:18,365
We do not really know what's going on.

460
00:26:18,574 --> 00:26:21,618
For us, it does not reduce the amount of pesticides,

461
00:26:21,785 --> 00:26:23,537
and chemicals that are cotton,

462
00:26:23,704 --> 00:26:25,539
that's one of the advantages that reduces that.

463
00:26:25,706 --> 00:26:28,292
Not in our area, where we are fumigating

464
00:26:28,458 --> 00:26:32,004
millions of acres and dollars Roundup,

465
00:26:32,171 --> 00:26:34,047
by all South Plains.

466
00:26:34,214 --> 00:26:36,675
What kind of impact does that have on our soil,

467
00:26:36,925 --> 00:26:40,721
with residues left to microbacterial level?

468
00:26:40,888 --> 00:26:42,222
What kind of impact does that

469
00:26:42,389 --> 00:26:44,266
about people in our communities?

470
00:26:44,433 --> 00:26:46,518
Where is the cost of that?

471
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:52,608
Monsanto is proud to be a leader

472
00:26:52,774 --> 00:26:54,318
of agricultural innovation sector

473
00:26:54,484 --> 00:26:57,237
so these agricultural developments can do to help

474
00:26:57,404 --> 00:27:00,282
double the performance for future needs in the world.

475
00:27:00,449 --> 00:27:02,993
We are dedicated to the future of agriculture,

476
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:05,245
and delivering innovations to farmers

477
00:27:05,412 --> 00:27:08,290
to help them produce more and conserve more,

478
00:27:08,457 --> 00:27:11,502
while they are improving the lives of people around the world.

479
00:27:11,668 --> 00:27:14,004
Together, we can face the challenges

480
00:27:14,171 --> 00:27:15,547
Next Generation

481
00:27:17,049 --> 00:27:18,550
and beyond.

482
00:27:29,394 --> 00:27:30,646
After the wars,

483
00:27:30,812 --> 00:27:32,648
where all these old factories

484
00:27:32,814 --> 00:27:37,945
that made war chemicals, explosives, were scattered about,

485
00:27:38,111 --> 00:27:40,405
Activist Vandana Shiva Environment

486
00:27:40,572 --> 00:27:44,326
Western countries thought it would be a good idea

487
00:27:44,493 --> 00:27:46,411
commercialize the Third World,

488
00:27:46,578 --> 00:27:49,289
after all, it makes explosives industry

489
00:27:49,456 --> 00:27:51,333
It makes nitrogen fertilizers.

490
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:54,294
And they began to introduce nitrogen fertilizers,

491
00:27:54,753 --> 00:27:58,298
from the 50s onwards, after we became independent.

492
00:27:58,465 --> 00:28:01,635
But nitrogen fertilizer

493
00:28:01,802 --> 00:28:05,138
They do not work well with indigenous crops.

494
00:28:05,305 --> 00:28:07,432
There is a problem of lodging.

495
00:28:07,599 --> 00:28:10,602
So the whole system then organized

496
00:28:10,769 --> 00:28:12,604
to redesign the plant

497
00:28:12,771 --> 00:28:15,357
to accept more chemicals.

498
00:28:15,524 --> 00:28:19,653
Bt cotton is cotton which has been added a gene,

499
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:22,948
of a bacteria to produce a toxin.

500
00:28:23,156 --> 00:28:24,658
But Bt cotton,

501
00:28:25,909 --> 00:28:27,703
which it is supposed to control a pest,

502
00:28:28,370 --> 00:28:33,959
It has been offered because it is a way of making companies own the seed.

503
00:28:34,126 --> 00:28:37,004
By patenting these genetically modified plants

504
00:28:37,171 --> 00:28:41,466
Monsanto became the largest chemical and seed group in history.

505
00:28:41,717 --> 00:28:44,595
I wanted to talk to someone who had worked with the company,

506
00:28:44,761 --> 00:28:47,097
and I found out that a former director general of India

507
00:28:47,264 --> 00:28:48,432
he was willing to talk.

508
00:28:48,599 --> 00:28:51,351
One of my friends who worked in research,

509
00:28:51,518 --> 00:28:53,562
He is working on these modified crops,

510
00:28:54,188 --> 00:28:56,273
He came to my hotel for a drink.

511
00:28:57,691 --> 00:29:00,652
We sat for a drink, and after a few drinks, he said:

512
00:29:00,819 --> 00:29:03,989
"Hey, Jag, will change the type of business

513
00:29:04,156 --> 00:29:05,824
you're doing in India. "

514
00:29:06,617 --> 00:29:08,202
I said, "What do you mean?"

515
00:29:08,368 --> 00:29:10,579
"They will get into the seed business.

516
00:29:11,038 --> 00:29:15,334
And they will do the business of seeds of all crops,

517
00:29:15,501 --> 00:29:18,253
so that we have a monopoly on the seeds,

518
00:29:18,754 --> 00:29:22,674
and every farmer has to always come to us to buy seeds. "

519
00:29:24,343 --> 00:29:26,345
That set off alarm bells in my mind.

520
00:29:27,054 --> 00:29:31,099
If a poor farmer has to go to buy Monsanto seeds each time,

521
00:29:31,892 --> 00:29:34,353
and a so expensive seeds,

522
00:29:34,728 --> 00:29:37,189
at that time I had no idea whatsoever Bt.

523
00:29:37,356 --> 00:29:39,637
Genetically modified seed, I had not thought of that.

524
00:29:40,609 --> 00:29:44,029
Even a monopoly on seeds is very bad.

525
00:29:44,613 --> 00:29:47,074
So farmers into debt to get the seed

526
00:29:47,241 --> 00:29:50,369
because of the high cost, 17 000 percent more.

527
00:29:50,536 --> 00:29:54,081
It is further into debt, because it violates the promise

528
00:29:54,248 --> 00:29:57,501
to control pests, so they have to buy more pesticides.

529
00:29:57,918 --> 00:30:01,588
The tragedy with chemicals, whether fertilizers or pesticides,

530
00:30:01,755 --> 00:30:05,259
It is that they are what is called ecological narcotics:

531
00:30:05,425 --> 00:30:07,803
the more you use, the more you need to use them.

532
00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:10,347
For a time, picking unique product increases

533
00:30:10,514 --> 00:30:11,640
and then begins to fall

534
00:30:11,807 --> 00:30:14,977
because it has contaminated the ground.

535
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:21,900
PUNYAB, INDIA

536
00:30:22,067 --> 00:30:25,153
Most Indian cotton is grown in the Punjab,

537
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:29,032
it has quickly become the largest user of pesticides in India.

538
00:30:30,242 --> 00:30:32,411
Dr. Pritpal Singh has studied the effects

539
00:30:32,578 --> 00:30:34,454
chemicals on human health

540
00:30:34,621 --> 00:30:38,166
and reports show a large increase in the number of birth defects,

541
00:30:38,333 --> 00:30:41,420
cancers and mental illnesses here in the region.

542
00:30:42,838 --> 00:30:44,673
You can go to each village

543
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:50,429
you will see hundreds of patients suffering from cancer.

544
00:30:50,596 --> 00:30:53,348
70 to 80 children in each village

545
00:30:53,515 --> 00:30:55,767
you will find that suffering

546
00:30:55,934 --> 00:30:58,437
severe mental retardation and physical disabilities.

547
00:31:13,285 --> 00:31:15,245
Companies of fertilizers, pesticides,

548
00:31:15,412 --> 00:31:17,497
totally reject

549
00:31:17,664 --> 00:31:20,292
the aftermath of pesticides and fertilizers,

550
00:31:20,459 --> 00:31:25,214
and these are the classic symptoms of toxicity.

551
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:29,968
In a village, there are 60 children with mental retardation as this guy.

552
00:31:30,135 --> 00:31:36,433
So it's a very dangerous phenomenon in the Punjab.

553
00:31:37,267 --> 00:31:41,897
And poor people, peasants, workers, and small farmers

554
00:31:42,064 --> 00:31:45,776
They have reached their full potential so they can not afford treatment.

555
00:31:45,943 --> 00:31:49,988
In short, they have accepted the death of their children.

556
00:31:50,364 --> 00:31:52,491
And they are waiting for the deaths of their children,

557
00:31:52,658 --> 00:31:55,244
Mother is waiting for the death of this boy.

558
00:31:56,161 --> 00:32:00,165
Companies that make GM seeds and chemicals

559
00:32:00,332 --> 00:32:01,667
They are the same companies.

560
00:32:01,834 --> 00:32:04,545
They are also the same companies that make drugs

561
00:32:04,711 --> 00:32:05,921
they are now patenting.

562
00:32:06,088 --> 00:32:08,423
So you have cancer, there are more benefits.

563
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:10,425
For them is to win, win, win ...

564
00:32:10,592 --> 00:32:13,804
For nature and people, it's lose, lose, lose ...

565
00:32:14,221 --> 00:32:16,849
It is the day in which agents of these companies

566
00:32:17,015 --> 00:32:18,892
They approach the farmer and tell him:

567
00:32:19,059 --> 00:32:21,937
"He owes me so much. He has not paid me.

568
00:32:22,104 --> 00:32:23,897
Now their land is my land. "

569
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:26,859
That day the farmer going to his farm,

570
00:32:27,150 --> 00:32:29,611
pesticide bottle of drink,

571
00:32:29,778 --> 00:32:30,778
and end his life.

572
00:32:30,904 --> 00:32:32,739
All the widows I speak, saying:

573
00:32:32,906 --> 00:32:34,283
"And the neighbors came and said

574
00:32:34,449 --> 00:32:36,785
that my husband lying on the field were found ".

575
00:32:38,662 --> 00:32:40,289
In the last 16 years,

576
00:32:40,455 --> 00:32:42,708
there have been more than 250 000

577
00:32:42,875 --> 00:32:45,836
Farmer suicides in India.

578
00:32:46,712 --> 00:32:49,464
That's about a farmer every 30 minutes.

579
00:32:49,631 --> 00:32:53,427
It is the largest wave of suicides that is registered in history.

580
00:33:00,142 --> 00:33:02,477
As the huge impact is evident

581
00:33:02,644 --> 00:33:04,229
which it is fashion in our world,

582
00:33:04,396 --> 00:33:06,023
there is growing research

583
00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:09,484
suggesting that also has an increasing effect on us,

584
00:33:09,651 --> 00:33:11,361
people who buy these clothes.

585
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:13,989
What we now know, 20 years later

586
00:33:14,156 --> 00:33:15,908
and hundreds of studies later,

587
00:33:16,074 --> 00:33:17,743
It is that the more people focus

588
00:33:17,910 --> 00:33:19,494
in these materialistic values,

589
00:33:19,661 --> 00:33:22,497
the more you say that money and image,

590
00:33:22,664 --> 00:33:26,001
and its status and possessions are important to them,

591
00:33:26,168 --> 00:33:27,211
the less happy they are,

592
00:33:27,377 --> 00:33:30,506
are more depressed, more anxious they are.

593
00:33:30,672 --> 00:33:33,675
We know that all these types of psychological problems

594
00:33:33,842 --> 00:33:37,387
They tend to increase when increasing materialistic values.

595
00:33:37,554 --> 00:33:41,934
Now, that is in total disagreement with the thousands of messages

596
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:45,854
we receive daily from ads

597
00:33:46,021 --> 00:33:49,441
suggesting that materialism and the pursuit of possessions

598
00:33:49,608 --> 00:33:52,027
and owning things is what will make us happy.

599
00:33:52,402 --> 00:33:56,240
It is important to understand that advertising is a kind,

600
00:33:56,406 --> 00:33:58,325
or category of propaganda.

601
00:33:58,867 --> 00:34:03,497
You think of it as something totalitarian propaganda, very shady,

602
00:34:03,789 --> 00:34:07,334
speakers, crowds chanting and all that,

603
00:34:07,501 --> 00:34:08,669
and we think of Hitler.

604
00:34:08,836 --> 00:34:11,547
We always think of it as something foreign

605
00:34:11,713 --> 00:34:13,799
but it is as American as apple pie.

606
00:34:17,886 --> 00:34:20,931
Well, advertising works because

607
00:34:21,098 --> 00:34:22,975
smart advertisers at least

608
00:34:23,141 --> 00:34:26,812
They are trying to link the consumption of its product

609
00:34:26,979 --> 00:34:30,440
a message that suggests

610
00:34:30,607 --> 00:34:32,985
that their needs will be met

611
00:34:33,151 --> 00:34:35,279
eating this thing.

612
00:34:35,445 --> 00:34:36,905
He wants you to believe

613
00:34:37,072 --> 00:34:39,449
it will look wonderful with that position.

614
00:34:39,616 --> 00:34:41,243
But then he puts it, and feels like:

615
00:34:41,410 --> 00:34:43,829
"No, it looks a little fat with it, is not so well with that,

616
00:34:43,996 --> 00:34:46,456
I regret having bought it, but there's another you can buy. "

617
00:34:49,793 --> 00:34:50,793
Put it NOW

618
00:34:50,836 --> 00:34:52,296
BUY NOW

619
00:35:15,527 --> 00:35:19,406
Think of all the car ads you see that show:

620
00:35:19,573 --> 00:35:22,492
"Well, finally I got it, I'm a competent person

621
00:35:22,659 --> 00:35:26,038
because I drive this BMW or the Audi ".

622
00:35:26,205 --> 00:35:28,832
Or think of all this shampoo that has seen,

623
00:35:28,999 --> 00:35:32,377
where the person now has beautiful hair

624
00:35:32,544 --> 00:35:35,631
and it is loved and appreciated by the people around her.

625
00:35:35,797 --> 00:35:37,674
The basic message is the same:

626
00:35:37,841 --> 00:35:40,427
how to solve the problems of his life,

627
00:35:40,594 --> 00:35:42,304
all have problems in our lives,

628
00:35:42,471 --> 00:35:45,682
how to solve the problems of your life is through consumption.

629
00:35:45,933 --> 00:35:46,934
Hi guys!

630
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:49,895
Today I bring you lots of clothes!

631
00:35:50,062 --> 00:35:53,607
I went shopping a couple of days ago and literally went crazy

632
00:35:53,774 --> 00:35:55,609
and I bought a lot of things.

633
00:35:55,776 --> 00:35:59,196
My mailbox spam, you know, has literally exploded,

634
00:35:59,363 --> 00:36:01,615
because you want a lot of clothes.

635
00:36:01,782 --> 00:36:03,575
So here it is.

636
00:36:03,742 --> 00:36:07,371
Agree. First, I have some things I bought at H & M.

637
00:36:07,538 --> 00:36:09,623
Then I went to Forever 21 ...

638
00:36:09,790 --> 00:36:12,918
No doubt about it, it was fate, I had to buy it,

639
00:36:13,085 --> 00:36:15,963
if I could levitate to me, I would have levitated.

640
00:36:16,129 --> 00:36:17,506
I bought this skirt,

641
00:36:18,632 --> 00:36:22,302
bright yellow, and cost $ 8.50.

642
00:36:22,469 --> 00:36:25,430
He is denim with buttons ...

643
00:36:25,597 --> 00:36:28,517
and I just loved it. Loved, loved, loved it!

644
00:36:28,684 --> 00:36:31,478
It is a gray knitted sweater, full of pink hearts.

645
00:36:31,645 --> 00:36:34,106
I loved it. I love the stained clothes.

646
00:36:34,273 --> 00:36:36,483
The garments are dyed tops.

647
00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:39,027
Has a little yin yang in the front.

648
00:36:39,194 --> 00:36:40,487
I love these so much.

649
00:36:40,654 --> 00:36:44,324
And it is this very beautiful light blue sweater.

650
00:36:44,491 --> 00:36:46,493
Not even know if I'll use it, now that I have,

651
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:47,860
because they do not know if I like both.

652
00:36:47,870 --> 00:36:49,913
I have to stop.

653
00:36:50,873 --> 00:36:54,168
MILAN, ITALY

654
00:36:56,003 --> 00:36:57,421
Try to understand better

655
00:36:57,588 --> 00:37:01,425
why people do not realize that they are becoming increasingly poor.

656
00:37:01,592 --> 00:37:04,011
And I wonder, "Well, but

657
00:37:04,178 --> 00:37:06,555
What has changed from when I was young? "

658
00:37:06,722 --> 00:37:09,766
And fashion is something that has changed dramatically.

659
00:37:09,933 --> 00:37:12,644
You could buy one, two shirts,

660
00:37:12,811 --> 00:37:14,771
four T-shirts, for example, a year.

661
00:37:14,938 --> 00:37:17,900
Now, also my children, they used to buy,

662
00:37:18,066 --> 00:37:20,152
for each party, buy a shirt.

663
00:37:20,319 --> 00:37:24,656
And so I realized that fast fashion is something totally new.

664
00:37:24,823 --> 00:37:29,119
If you have noticed the price has fallen in recent years.

665
00:37:29,286 --> 00:37:33,498
And following the disappearance of the middle class.

666
00:37:33,707 --> 00:37:36,335
So all you people really need

667
00:37:36,502 --> 00:37:38,295
It is very expensive,

668
00:37:38,462 --> 00:37:43,008
like a home, as studies such as life insurance.

669
00:37:43,467 --> 00:37:47,179
Moreover, there is a source of comfort

670
00:37:48,430 --> 00:37:50,015
part of his life.

671
00:37:50,182 --> 00:37:53,852
They can buy a T-shirt,

672
00:37:54,019 --> 00:37:57,105
two shirts for holidays, or finally by day,

673
00:37:58,023 --> 00:38:00,359
although I am very poor and I'm lost.

674
00:38:00,526 --> 00:38:02,778
I lost everything I really needed.

675
00:38:03,195 --> 00:38:04,988
Today we buy more than 80 billion

676
00:38:05,155 --> 00:38:06,990
of wearing new clothes every year.

677
00:38:07,157 --> 00:38:11,370
That's 400% more than the amount they bought just two decades ago.

678
00:38:11,537 --> 00:38:14,414
The way we buy clothes has changed so much, so fast

679
00:38:14,581 --> 00:38:16,625
few people actually stopped to

680
00:38:16,792 --> 00:38:19,586
understand the origin of this new model, or consequences

681
00:38:19,753 --> 00:38:22,840
such unprecedented increase in consumption.

682
00:38:23,006 --> 00:38:26,718
There is an article in Printers' Ink

683
00:38:27,094 --> 00:38:31,098
which is currently the leader in magazine advertising,

684
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:35,686
a famous writer, called Earnest Elmo Calkins,

685
00:38:35,853 --> 00:38:39,857
he was a great master of the art of copywriting.

686
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:42,526
It was an article titled "Consumption".

687
00:38:43,735 --> 00:38:47,781
In that article, he says there are two kinds of products.

688
00:38:48,824 --> 00:38:51,410
The class to use,

689
00:38:52,119 --> 00:38:54,872
as washing machines, cars and so on,

690
00:38:55,122 --> 00:38:58,458
the things you buy and use for a long time.

691
00:38:59,376 --> 00:39:01,712
And then there are the things you consume,

692
00:39:02,296 --> 00:39:05,382
as chewing gum, cigarette, and other perishables.

693
00:39:05,924 --> 00:39:09,887
He said that consumerism is getting people

694
00:39:10,053 --> 00:39:12,347
try the things you use,

695
00:39:12,848 --> 00:39:14,683
as things you eat.

696
00:39:14,933 --> 00:39:17,811
With its innovative offer Buy 1, Take 3 Free,

697
00:39:17,978 --> 00:39:19,396
un traje de Jos. A. Bank

698
00:39:19,563 --> 00:39:21,982
It is actually cheaper than paper towels.

699
00:39:22,733 --> 00:39:25,611
And now come these dispensers easy to use.

700
00:39:26,904 --> 00:39:30,032
Four suits for the price of a modest dinner,

701
00:39:30,199 --> 00:39:33,035
I feel good to throw them away when finished.

702
00:39:36,830 --> 00:39:38,707
Just look landfills

703
00:39:38,874 --> 00:39:40,375
and you can see in landfills

704
00:39:40,542 --> 00:39:43,212
that the amount of clothing and textiles that are thrown away,

705
00:39:43,378 --> 00:39:46,548
It has been increasing steadily in the last ten years,

706
00:39:46,715 --> 00:39:49,885
like a dirty shade of the fast fashion industry.

707
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:56,016
As we move more and more

708
00:39:56,183 --> 00:39:57,935
degradation species,

709
00:39:58,101 --> 00:40:02,189
to destroy the last pristine wilderness we have left,

710
00:40:02,356 --> 00:40:05,776
We seem bent on producing more and more disposable things.

711
00:40:05,943 --> 00:40:07,361
It makes no sense.

712
00:40:07,528 --> 00:40:10,656
Fashion should never and can never be considered

713
00:40:10,822 --> 00:40:12,324
as a disposable product.

714
00:40:12,699 --> 00:40:15,494
After a big change in any sector,

715
00:40:15,661 --> 00:40:18,830
it takes time to feel and smell

716
00:40:18,997 --> 00:40:22,668
dirt coming out of something that is polluting.

717
00:40:22,876 --> 00:40:25,170
So I think there is now a change

718
00:40:25,337 --> 00:40:28,549
because you can not deny

719
00:40:29,049 --> 00:40:30,801
industry Fast Fashion

720
00:40:30,968 --> 00:40:33,554
It has a massive impact on developing countries.

721
00:40:34,054 --> 00:40:36,557
The average American takes 37 kilos

722
00:40:36,723 --> 00:40:38,934
you textile waste each year.

723
00:40:39,101 --> 00:40:42,187
Adding up to more than 11 million tons of textile waste

724
00:40:42,354 --> 00:40:43,981
the EE. UU. only.

725
00:40:44,189 --> 00:40:46,650
Most of these wastes are not biodegradable.

726
00:40:46,817 --> 00:40:49,611
Meaning it stays in landfills 200 years or more,

727
00:40:49,778 --> 00:40:52,489
air while emitting harmful gases.

728
00:40:52,865 --> 00:40:55,868
The large amount of cheap clothes,

729
00:40:56,118 --> 00:40:59,746
although people feel, perhaps somehow,

730
00:41:00,497 --> 00:41:02,875
compensating to donate to charities.

731
00:41:03,208 --> 00:41:06,670
The journey of a shirt donated to charities

732
00:41:06,837 --> 00:41:08,839
It is difficult to accept in itself.

733
00:41:11,967 --> 00:41:12,967
PORT AU PRINCE, HAITI

734
00:41:13,093 --> 00:41:16,096
Pepe is a disease in Haiti.

735
00:41:16,388 --> 00:41:18,223
Not only in Haiti, I think in any

736
00:41:18,390 --> 00:41:20,601
third world country you visit.

737
00:41:20,767 --> 00:41:23,478
It is a problem, it's a huge problem.

738
00:41:24,104 --> 00:41:26,690
Pepe is a lot of clothes,

739
00:41:26,857 --> 00:41:30,027
mostly from the United States,

740
00:41:30,819 --> 00:41:33,363
People will buy a box of clothes ...

741
00:41:33,530 --> 00:41:35,532
They do not even know what they are buying.

742
00:41:35,741 --> 00:41:39,203
It's clothes that people donate to charities,

743
00:41:39,536 --> 00:41:43,749
and these can not sell in their thrift store or whatever,

744
00:41:43,916 --> 00:41:47,961
the packed and shipped to these third countries

745
00:41:48,128 --> 00:41:49,880
and most end here.

746
00:41:50,047 --> 00:41:51,632
It turns out that only 10 percent

747
00:41:51,798 --> 00:41:52,966
We donate clothes

748
00:41:53,133 --> 00:41:55,385
gets sold in thrift stores.

749
00:41:55,761 --> 00:41:58,013
And as we let our clothes faster and faster,

750
00:41:58,180 --> 00:42:00,974
now increasingly discarded in developing countries,

751
00:42:01,141 --> 00:42:02,267
as Haiti.

752
00:42:02,601 --> 00:42:04,019
As the second-hand clothes

753
00:42:04,186 --> 00:42:06,063
into Haiti has increased,

754
00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:08,857
the local textile industry has disappeared.

755
00:42:09,441 --> 00:42:11,693
What once was a sector proudest making garments,

756
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:14,446
Haiti now produces mainly cheap shirts

757
00:42:14,613 --> 00:42:16,448
to be exported to the United States.

758
00:42:16,907 --> 00:42:20,661
Because earlier when you were working

759
00:42:20,827 --> 00:42:24,414
used to see people coming to learn to sew.

760
00:42:24,581 --> 00:42:28,168
The person could come to learn, and asked me to teach them to sew.

761
00:42:28,335 --> 00:42:29,920
Then he taught them.

762
00:42:30,087 --> 00:42:33,215
And they learned to sew,

763
00:42:33,382 --> 00:42:35,676
You knew they would find a job with that ability.

764
00:42:35,843 --> 00:42:39,805
However, today, the person can learn to sew

765
00:42:39,972 --> 00:42:42,891
but you can not find work or make a living doing that.

766
00:42:46,103 --> 00:42:49,189
I tell people to stop buying things,

767
00:42:49,356 --> 00:42:52,442
that's not right, costs about $ 10,

768
00:42:52,609 --> 00:42:54,987
vas a ir a un baile,

769
00:42:55,153 --> 00:42:57,197
are you going out today. Just you go to a store

770
00:42:57,364 --> 00:42:59,283
and you buy a dress for $ 10.

771
00:42:59,449 --> 00:43:02,077
Because it costs only $ 10, and I can throw it away.

772
00:43:02,244 --> 00:43:03,996
And tomorrow you will do the same,

773
00:43:04,162 --> 00:43:06,123
and again.

774
00:43:08,041 --> 00:43:11,003
While growing awareness of the impact of fashion in the world,

775
00:43:11,170 --> 00:43:13,630
there are key industry leaders who begin to question

776
00:43:13,797 --> 00:43:16,800
the impacts of a model based on production inconsiderate

777
00:43:16,967 --> 00:43:18,510
and endless consumption.

778
00:43:18,677 --> 00:43:22,764
In Patagonia, we hate the word "consumers".

779
00:43:24,224 --> 00:43:27,644
We have to find a better word, we prefer "customers"

780
00:43:27,811 --> 00:43:31,273
and we prefer clients who recognize

781
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,609
the impact of their consumption.

782
00:43:33,775 --> 00:43:38,739
They recognize that, as consumers, are part of the problem.

783
00:43:39,239 --> 00:43:43,785
We hope to encourage our customers to join

784
00:43:43,952 --> 00:43:46,330
to us for questioning consumption.

785
00:43:46,496 --> 00:43:48,540
Because without a reduction in consumption,

786
00:43:48,707 --> 00:43:52,336
we believe that we will not find a collective solution

787
00:43:52,503 --> 00:43:57,549
to the problems we face collectively, year after year,

788
00:43:58,175 --> 00:44:01,887
They are leading to continued deterioration in the health of our planet.

789
00:44:03,597 --> 00:44:05,933
The fashion industry has to think.

790
00:44:06,350 --> 00:44:10,145
You have to stand and watch has been running

791
00:44:10,312 --> 00:44:13,649
in a conventional manner, and to question, challenge him.

792
00:44:13,941 --> 00:44:15,234
For me it is, as a designer,

793
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:18,028
the most exciting thing I do now.

794
00:44:18,195 --> 00:44:20,989
More exciting to say: "I like this color this season"

795
00:44:21,156 --> 00:44:23,909
or "This is the silhouette, or the hemline."

796
00:44:24,076 --> 00:44:27,329
For me, a much greater challenge and excitement

797
00:44:27,496 --> 00:44:29,790
is actually looking at my industry and say, "You know what?

798
00:44:29,957 --> 00:44:31,375
I will try to do it in a way

799
00:44:31,542 --> 00:44:34,002
it is not as harmful to the planet. "

800
00:44:35,003 --> 00:44:40,300
The companies, through advertising, have made society believe

801
00:44:40,467 --> 00:44:45,097
that happiness is based on things,

802
00:44:45,264 --> 00:44:47,683
that true happiness can only be achieved

803
00:44:47,850 --> 00:44:53,146
with annual, seasonal, weekly gain, daily

804
00:44:53,313 --> 00:44:55,649
in the amount of things that you take your life.

805
00:44:55,816 --> 00:44:58,569
We encourage our customers

806
00:44:58,735 --> 00:45:00,904
to rethink those assumptions,

807
00:45:01,071 --> 00:45:03,532
to understand where they come from.

808
00:45:03,699 --> 00:45:07,077
And to understand it, to know it all together

809
00:45:07,244 --> 00:45:08,495
we can change how.

810
00:45:08,662 --> 00:45:11,540
The customer has to know who is responsible.

811
00:45:11,707 --> 00:45:13,625
Without them, we have no jobs.

812
00:45:13,792 --> 00:45:15,127
And that's really important.

813
00:45:15,294 --> 00:45:17,171
So you do not have to accept it.

814
00:45:17,337 --> 00:45:19,381
If you do not like, you do not have to accept it.

815
00:45:19,965 --> 00:45:22,134
Rajshahi, Bangladesh

816
00:45:23,010 --> 00:45:25,179
I love embroidery, Shantu.

817
00:45:28,015 --> 00:45:29,266
The embroidery is very beautiful.

818
00:45:29,433 --> 00:45:31,894
Do you think we should not put the embroidery on both sides?

819
00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:35,230
I think we should put the embroidery here too.

820
00:45:35,731 --> 00:45:38,400
I think it looks a bit simple if only forward.

821
00:45:38,567 --> 00:45:40,944
So let's put it on the sides as well.

822
00:45:41,778 --> 00:45:43,030
It will not add much cost.

823
00:45:43,197 --> 00:45:44,865
It is not as dense, right?

824
00:45:45,032 --> 00:45:46,950
How about?

825
00:45:50,245 --> 00:45:53,248
Swallows is a fashion company fair trade

826
00:45:53,415 --> 00:45:56,043
but it is also a development partnership.

827
00:45:56,210 --> 00:46:00,214
So it is helping more than 3,000 people in this town.

828
00:46:02,049 --> 00:46:03,634
I come here every four months.

829
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:05,677
We call them "journeys of production."

830
00:46:05,844 --> 00:46:08,180
And we work with manufacturers,

831
00:46:08,347 --> 00:46:10,349
trying to figure out what the barriers are

832
00:46:10,516 --> 00:46:13,852
to make a great product and make it to market.

833
00:46:14,019 --> 00:46:16,605
And we encourage fair trade capabilities.

834
00:46:16,772 --> 00:46:19,316
So what are the obstacles facing

835
00:46:19,483 --> 00:46:21,568
to provide more social benefits

836
00:46:21,735 --> 00:46:25,864
or improve environmental protection in these areas.

837
00:46:26,031 --> 00:46:27,950
For me, it's partnering.

838
00:46:28,116 --> 00:46:29,993
It's about finding creative solutions,

839
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:32,621
next to them, with the team here,

840
00:46:32,788 --> 00:46:34,790
and really listen to what their problems

841
00:46:34,957 --> 00:46:37,376
and find together the way they actually work.

842
00:46:47,427 --> 00:46:52,432
I want to invite the best employee of Swallows,

843
00:46:52,724 --> 00:46:57,521
I want to invite a woman representative of Swallows,

844
00:46:57,855 --> 00:47:01,733
to come to London in autumn or next spring.

845
00:47:02,150 --> 00:47:03,986
And I'd like to think

846
00:47:04,152 --> 00:47:06,405
Who would be the best representative.

847
00:47:07,406 --> 00:47:09,324
But I want you to know who your customers are,

848
00:47:09,491 --> 00:47:11,952
and I want you to really understand the market

849
00:47:12,119 --> 00:47:14,288
and come back and tell all your friends.

850
00:47:41,565 --> 00:47:44,359
Or, if you do single thread, simple stitch,

851
00:47:44,526 --> 00:47:46,904
then maybe you need to do denser?

852
00:47:47,070 --> 00:47:48,655
- Good. - More focused?

853
00:48:01,793 --> 00:48:04,254
If it continues for a while,

854
00:48:04,421 --> 00:48:07,174
we will climb the showroom now, PV15.

855
00:48:07,341 --> 00:48:10,886
Can you come and show us the next thing to do?

856
00:48:11,053 --> 00:48:12,054
Yes.

857
00:48:16,350 --> 00:48:19,228
People Tree hoped would not be necessary,

858
00:48:19,394 --> 00:48:23,815
and I hoped we had a trading system to take care

859
00:48:23,982 --> 00:48:26,944
the rights of people and the environment.

860
00:48:27,861 --> 00:48:30,280
But the more I'm involved in the development,

861
00:48:30,447 --> 00:48:31,865
and collaboration with partners,

862
00:48:32,032 --> 00:48:36,453
more dirt and filth I discovered

863
00:48:36,620 --> 00:48:38,247
about business practices

864
00:48:38,413 --> 00:48:40,123
undermine everything we believe in,

865
00:48:40,290 --> 00:48:44,378
and all I know that most people believe and value.

866
00:48:47,381 --> 00:48:49,581
I do not know, People Tree really grew in an organic way.

867
00:48:49,716 --> 00:48:52,427
It grew from a large group of people

868
00:48:52,594 --> 00:48:55,222
who believe passionately that there is a different way of ...

869
00:48:55,556 --> 00:48:58,642
To work, to live, to eat,

870
00:48:58,809 --> 00:49:02,020
to interact with people in a humane way.

871
00:49:05,566 --> 00:49:07,818
I not necessarily think that would be a thousand shops

872
00:49:07,985 --> 00:49:09,486
selling today People Tree,

873
00:49:10,821 --> 00:49:13,031
and I see that there is much more we need to do.

874
00:49:13,198 --> 00:49:15,659
I think not just about creating jobs

875
00:49:15,826 --> 00:49:18,078
for 7000 people working at People Tree.

876
00:49:18,245 --> 00:49:20,998
It also seeks to be a catalyst for change in the sector,

877
00:49:21,164 --> 00:49:23,625
showing, proving that the model works.

878
00:49:35,429 --> 00:49:36,847
When we begin to be organic,

879
00:49:37,014 --> 00:49:38,974
I think we were only two or three at the time,

880
00:49:39,141 --> 00:49:42,186
Marketing Cooperative formed the Texas Organic Cotton,

881
00:49:42,352 --> 00:49:44,855
and the agreement was that they grew and sold it.

882
00:49:45,022 --> 00:49:47,149
So I started going to Jacob Javits

883
00:49:47,316 --> 00:49:50,068
and with all this cotton plants and everything,

884
00:49:50,235 --> 00:49:52,362
we said, "Yes, we have organic cotton"

885
00:49:52,529 --> 00:49:55,741
and people looked at us like we're totally crazy.

886
00:49:57,826 --> 00:50:00,370
Consumers often become aware of ...

887
00:50:00,537 --> 00:50:02,873
Organic milk, or have an allergy.

888
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:05,417
And, curiously, cotton,

889
00:50:05,584 --> 00:50:06,784
and what they put on the body

890
00:50:06,835 --> 00:50:09,254
although the skin is the body's largest organ,

891
00:50:09,421 --> 00:50:10,589
it is not even important

892
00:50:10,756 --> 00:50:13,217
they do not understand the connection of saying,

893
00:50:13,383 --> 00:50:15,093
"I like this organic apple,

894
00:50:15,260 --> 00:50:17,638
so I'm not getting directly

895
00:50:17,804 --> 00:50:20,724
pesticides or chemicals, or whatever the case. "

896
00:50:20,891 --> 00:50:23,352
But they do not understand the direct connection with clothing.

897
00:50:23,519 --> 00:50:26,772
And so you have to start looking at the broader community level.

898
00:50:26,939 --> 00:50:29,024
This is our air, our world.

899
00:50:29,191 --> 00:50:31,568
This is our planet, our people.

900
00:50:31,735 --> 00:50:34,238
And so that awareness of ...

901
00:50:34,404 --> 00:50:36,657
You may not feel they have a direct impact

902
00:50:36,823 --> 00:50:38,617
buying this organic shirt.

903
00:50:39,535 --> 00:50:41,161
But the impact

904
00:50:41,328 --> 00:50:43,747
It is in the bigger picture, in the world at large,

905
00:50:43,914 --> 00:50:47,042
and especially where the community has grown cotton.

906
00:50:59,513 --> 00:51:01,348
As hard frost arrives,

907
00:51:01,515 --> 00:51:03,559
as organic farmers, we hope that icy

908
00:51:03,809 --> 00:51:08,272
because that literally skims, removes leaves the plant,

909
00:51:08,730 --> 00:51:12,651
so that when harvested, mature capsules are open,

910
00:51:12,943 --> 00:51:14,611
and cotton leaves here,

911
00:51:14,778 --> 00:51:16,738
and you can see what comes in sections.

912
00:51:17,990 --> 00:51:20,951
This machine is called cotton harvester.

913
00:51:21,118 --> 00:51:22,661
And it is called cotton harvester

914
00:51:22,828 --> 00:51:25,497
because literally it comes and starts,

915
00:51:25,873 --> 00:51:27,958
use something like fingers, and literally starts

916
00:51:28,125 --> 00:51:31,628
all capsules of this plant.

917
00:51:32,087 --> 00:51:34,173
So if you look here, you can see

918
00:51:34,381 --> 00:51:37,342
Combine and went out there and has collected all the plants.

919
00:51:48,353 --> 00:51:51,064
I think one of the problems we have in the current model

920
00:51:51,231 --> 00:51:52,831
It is that what matters is profit.

921
00:51:52,983 --> 00:51:58,030
And do not take into account: "This cost, at what price?"

922
00:51:58,197 --> 00:51:59,656
The price of polluting the water,

923
00:51:59,823 --> 00:52:01,575
the price of labor,

924
00:52:01,742 --> 00:52:02,993
the bars on the window,

925
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:05,704
that people die when a fire in the factory,

926
00:52:05,871 --> 00:52:08,874
the price of farmers who have no access

927
00:52:09,041 --> 00:52:10,959
education and health services.

928
00:52:11,126 --> 00:52:14,671
And so we really have not calculated what the real price.

929
00:52:20,093 --> 00:52:23,722
Kanpur is located along the Ganges River,

930
00:52:23,889 --> 00:52:26,266
which is the most sacred river.

931
00:52:26,433 --> 00:52:31,730
And it is also very important for 800 million Hindus

932
00:52:31,897 --> 00:52:36,401
and also it serves as a way of life for northern India.

933
00:52:36,568 --> 00:52:39,571
Leather factories Kanpur

934
00:52:39,738 --> 00:52:42,866
They are polluting and killing this river.

935
00:52:44,952 --> 00:52:48,205
With the growing demand for inexpensive materials such as leather,

936
00:52:48,372 --> 00:52:51,917
Kanpur is now the capital of leather exports from India.

937
00:53:01,593 --> 00:53:05,472
Every day, more than 50 million liters of toxic wastewater

938
00:53:05,639 --> 00:53:07,224
leaving local tanneries.

939
00:53:07,391 --> 00:53:10,269
Chemical complexes used to treat leather, such as chromium-6,

940
00:53:10,435 --> 00:53:13,313
flow into local agriculture and even drinking water.

941
00:53:14,356 --> 00:53:17,568
In places like Kanpur, hidden in the eyes of the world,

942
00:53:17,734 --> 00:53:20,362
big Western brands get cheaper materials

943
00:53:20,529 --> 00:53:24,283
while avoiding any responsibility for the rising cost to human health

944
00:53:24,741 --> 00:53:26,159
and the environment.

945
00:53:36,044 --> 00:53:41,717
The people in that area is affected by pollution from the tanneries.

946
00:53:42,176 --> 00:53:47,347
The local environment is polluted, the soil is contaminated.

947
00:53:47,514 --> 00:53:50,434
The only source of drinking water,

948
00:53:50,851 --> 00:53:53,937
groundwater is contaminated with chromium.

949
00:53:54,146 --> 00:53:56,064
Agricultural products,

950
00:53:56,231 --> 00:53:59,693
even vegetables and salad products,

951
00:53:59,860 --> 00:54:01,862
They produced there.

952
00:54:02,029 --> 00:54:05,032
The health of people affected.

953
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:08,493
People have different types of skin problems:

954
00:54:09,453 --> 00:54:12,080
skin rashes, blisters, pustules,

955
00:54:12,247 --> 00:54:13,749
numbness of the limbs.

956
00:54:13,916 --> 00:54:18,670
People have stomach ailments, they may also have cancer.

957
00:54:20,506 --> 00:54:23,091
My daughter suffers from jaundice.

958
00:54:23,258 --> 00:54:27,095
Every year, people in nearly every house in this region

959
00:54:27,262 --> 00:54:28,472
suffers from this disease.

960
00:54:28,639 --> 00:54:31,141
Even my wife had jaundice.

961
00:54:31,308 --> 00:54:34,937
As I said, many people every year have the same problem.

962
00:54:35,103 --> 00:54:39,900
We used all our savings to treat diseases,

963
00:54:40,067 --> 00:54:44,655
because the chromium in the water

964
00:54:44,821 --> 00:54:48,283
attacks the liver,

965
00:54:48,450 --> 00:54:54,081
creates digestive problems, and many people can get jaundice

966
00:54:54,248 --> 00:54:58,418
or liver cancer if we do not take precautions.

967
00:54:59,294 --> 00:55:02,047
You may have the best materials

968
00:55:02,214 --> 00:55:07,052
the market for high-end fashion in Milan or Paris or London.

969
00:55:07,511 --> 00:55:12,015
But there has been so much work behind it,

970
00:55:12,182 --> 00:55:14,184
and they have been used many chemicals,

971
00:55:14,351 --> 00:55:17,271
effluents were discharged into many rivers.

972
00:55:17,437 --> 00:55:20,023
But we're just looking at that moment in time

973
00:55:20,190 --> 00:55:21,859
the finished product.

974
00:55:22,234 --> 00:55:25,028
We have to go back and think about it.

975
00:55:28,448 --> 00:55:31,535
The fashion today is the second most polluting industry

976
00:55:31,702 --> 00:55:34,955
on earth, second only to the oil industry.

977
00:55:35,330 --> 00:55:37,583
The alarming thing is that fashion not only used

978
00:55:37,749 --> 00:55:39,459
a wealth of natural resources,

979
00:55:39,626 --> 00:55:42,004
and make amazing environmental effects,

980
00:55:42,171 --> 00:55:46,049
these natural resources and the impact often are not even measured.

981
00:55:46,216 --> 00:55:49,803
As they have been so abundant these resources,

982
00:55:50,637 --> 00:55:52,973
it is assumed that they will be around forever.

983
00:55:53,515 --> 00:55:55,976
So I think the industry has not justified

984
00:55:56,143 --> 00:55:59,605
because it is only from the 50s

985
00:56:00,022 --> 00:56:04,026
we've really had this industrial expansion

986
00:56:04,193 --> 00:56:08,405
at such a rate that we start to see exponential growth

987
00:56:08,572 --> 00:56:10,991
and exponential use of natural resources.

988
00:56:11,575 --> 00:56:14,494
Our lives depend on the economy first nature.

989
00:56:14,661 --> 00:56:16,622
Nature has an economy.

990
00:56:16,788 --> 00:56:20,501
That economy is enormous. It is not counted.

991
00:56:20,876 --> 00:56:24,004
Then there is the economy of the people, the workers, laborers,

992
00:56:24,171 --> 00:56:25,506
Farmers growing.

993
00:56:25,672 --> 00:56:29,092
That became invisible through this construct,

994
00:56:29,259 --> 00:56:31,929
first the Depression, then during the war years,

995
00:56:32,095 --> 00:56:36,266
the number called GDP, gross domestic product,

996
00:56:36,433 --> 00:56:41,480
that only measures which are traded,

997
00:56:41,688 --> 00:56:43,398
and it has become a commodity.

998
00:56:43,565 --> 00:56:45,317
Many resources

999
00:56:45,484 --> 00:56:49,738
we use to make our clothes have not been justified

1000
00:56:49,905 --> 00:56:53,534
in the production cost of such clothing.

1001
00:56:54,117 --> 00:56:59,414
Then you have the water used to produce clothing,

1002
00:56:59,581 --> 00:57:02,376
land used to grow the fiber,

1003
00:57:03,293 --> 00:57:06,421
chemicals used for dyeing.

1004
00:57:07,214 --> 00:57:11,134
Those things are all inputs.

1005
00:57:11,593 --> 00:57:14,888
And as inputs, they have a cost,

1006
00:57:15,639 --> 00:57:17,891
and also give products

1007
00:57:18,058 --> 00:57:22,187
in some cases, good products, the clothing itself, jobs,

1008
00:57:22,354 --> 00:57:26,275
but in other cases, bad products, such as harmful chemicals,

1009
00:57:26,441 --> 00:57:28,318
or emissions of greenhouse gases,

1010
00:57:28,485 --> 00:57:30,362
and those things also have a cost.

1011
00:57:41,039 --> 00:57:43,750
Sleeping on pillow.

1012
00:57:44,001 --> 00:57:46,336
Do you feel bad leaving Nadia?

1013
00:57:46,503 --> 00:57:50,090
Of course I feel bad, but I can not do anything.

1014
00:57:50,257 --> 00:57:54,344
Working here, I am forced to leave the village.

1015
00:57:54,511 --> 00:57:56,972
In the past two months, he did not sit with their books.

1016
00:57:57,139 --> 00:57:58,640
Just watch TV and cartoons.

1017
00:57:58,807 --> 00:58:00,017
And music videos.

1018
00:58:00,184 --> 00:58:02,519
But if he stays in the village, you can not do that.

1019
00:58:02,686 --> 00:58:05,147
He goes to school in the morning, again at noon

1020
00:58:05,314 --> 00:58:08,150
and 3 pm will tutoring.

1021
00:58:08,317 --> 00:58:09,526
That's not possible here.

1022
00:58:12,112 --> 00:58:14,489
What do you do with Nadia now?

1023
00:58:14,656 --> 00:58:17,367
Sometimes I leave with the neighbor,

1024
00:58:17,534 --> 00:58:22,289
Sometimes his father used to take care of it.

1025
00:58:22,456 --> 00:58:24,625
And I took my works sometimes.

1026
00:58:24,791 --> 00:58:26,710
I took her to the factory yesterday.

1027
00:58:31,465 --> 00:58:34,051
The same low wages that make places like Bangladesh

1028
00:58:34,218 --> 00:58:36,470
so attractive for brands to do business,

1029
00:58:36,637 --> 00:58:40,015
have left millions of workers working long hours,

1030
00:58:40,182 --> 00:58:42,392
unable to afford to keep their children with them,

1031
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:45,187
even in the poorest slums.

1032
00:58:45,354 --> 00:58:47,397
To give their children an education,

1033
00:58:47,564 --> 00:58:50,400
and the chance for a better life in future factories,

1034
00:58:50,567 --> 00:58:54,404
many textile workers here, as Shima, leave their children

1035
00:58:54,571 --> 00:58:57,908
to raise them family or friends in villages far from the city,

1036
00:58:58,075 --> 00:59:00,994
and only see once or twice a year.

1037
00:59:44,204 --> 00:59:46,290
This is my dad,

1038
00:59:46,456 --> 00:59:49,585
over a year since I saw him.

1039
00:59:49,751 --> 00:59:52,337
Sometimes I talk to him by phone,

1040
00:59:52,504 --> 00:59:56,133
but over a year since I saw him.

1041
00:59:57,885 --> 00:59:59,803
This is my mom,

1042
01:00:01,597 --> 01:00:04,141
a year ago he has not seen.

1043
01:00:04,474 --> 01:00:08,979
I talk to her on the phone too, but do not see often.

1044
01:00:48,727 --> 01:00:52,022
The struggle of the workers of Bangladesh has no limits.

1045
01:00:52,189 --> 01:00:55,359
Each day we woke up early in the morning,

1046
01:00:55,526 --> 01:00:59,613
we go to the factory, and we work very hard all day.

1047
01:00:59,780 --> 01:01:03,700
And we do all the hard work clothes.

1048
01:01:03,867 --> 01:01:08,747
And that's what people use.

1049
01:01:08,956 --> 01:01:15,337
People have no idea how hard it is for us to do the laundry.

1050
01:01:15,504 --> 01:01:18,632
Only buy and use it.

1051
01:01:18,799 --> 01:01:21,593
I think these clothes are produced with our blood.

1052
01:01:21,844 --> 01:01:26,723
Many textile workers die in separate accidents.

1053
01:01:26,890 --> 01:01:31,562
About a year ago, there was a cave in Rana Plaza.

1054
01:01:31,728 --> 01:01:35,023
Many workers died there.

1055
01:01:35,190 --> 01:01:39,361
It is very painful for us.

1056
01:01:39,778 --> 01:01:43,323
I do not want anyone seen anything,

1057
01:01:43,490 --> 01:01:45,742
to occur with our blood.

1058
01:01:45,909 --> 01:01:48,871
We want better working conditions, so that all are aware.

1059
01:01:49,037 --> 01:01:53,041
I do not want another owner as Rana Square

1060
01:01:53,208 --> 01:01:57,546
run that risk and force workers

1061
01:01:57,713 --> 01:02:01,216
to work in such conditions.

1062
01:02:01,383 --> 01:02:04,553
Lest they die more workers as well.

1063
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:08,473
For there is no more mothers who lost their children as well.

1064
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:12,603
I do not want this, I want that the owners are a little more aware

1065
01:02:12,769 --> 01:02:14,396
and take care of us.

1066
01:02:20,986 --> 01:02:22,946
You know? Really hit profits

1067
01:02:23,113 --> 01:02:28,118
their need to work, to use as slaves.

1068
01:02:28,285 --> 01:02:31,955
And I'm not saying that ... We have to give them work,

1069
01:02:32,122 --> 01:02:36,460
but they must be treated with the same respect

1070
01:02:36,627 --> 01:02:39,713
with which we treat our children, our friends.

1071
01:02:39,880 --> 01:02:41,632
They are not different from us.

1072
01:02:41,924 --> 01:02:44,301
Livia Firth has called for major changes

1073
01:02:44,468 --> 01:02:45,552
in the fashion industry.

1074
01:02:45,719 --> 01:02:47,221
She made headlines for starting something

1075
01:02:47,387 --> 01:02:49,097
called "The Challenge of Green Carpet"

1076
01:02:49,264 --> 01:02:50,974
urging famous and great designers

1077
01:02:51,141 --> 01:02:53,852
to participate in more fashion conscious ways.

1078
01:02:54,061 --> 01:02:56,897
Sustainability runs a consultancy called Eco Age,

1079
01:02:57,064 --> 01:02:59,066
and he has been invited to speak at a conference

1080
01:02:59,233 --> 01:03:00,692
about the future of fashion.

1081
01:03:00,943 --> 01:03:03,028
If there fast fashion,

1082
01:03:03,320 --> 01:03:05,781
no need to have a summit in Copenhagen

1083
01:03:05,948 --> 01:03:09,743
to try to solve the disaster of the destruction of the environment,

1084
01:03:09,910 --> 01:03:13,163
destruction of social justice, which has been caused

1085
01:03:13,330 --> 01:03:16,750
in the last 15 or 20 years of its existence.

1086
01:03:16,917 --> 01:03:19,253
Fast Fashion wants to produce fast,

1087
01:03:19,628 --> 01:03:23,882
so the textile worker has to produce faster and cheaper.

1088
01:03:24,049 --> 01:03:28,011
So the textile worker is the only point of the supply chain

1089
01:03:28,178 --> 01:03:30,097
where margins are compressed.

1090
01:03:30,264 --> 01:03:33,934
And we have these huge companies

1091
01:03:34,101 --> 01:03:35,686
They are going to the factory in Bangladesh,

1092
01:03:35,853 --> 01:03:38,188
They make an order for 1.5 million jeans

1093
01:03:38,355 --> 01:03:42,109
30 cents each, 50 cents each ...

1094
01:03:42,276 --> 01:03:43,986
How can it be ethical?

1095
01:03:44,152 --> 01:03:45,362
I do not know.

1096
01:03:46,572 --> 01:03:48,699
But also, from the point of view of the consumer,

1097
01:03:48,866 --> 01:03:52,202
Is it really democratic buy a shirt for $ 5

1098
01:03:52,369 --> 01:03:54,830
or pay $ 20 for their jeans?

1099
01:03:54,997 --> 01:03:57,708
Or are we kidding?

1100
01:03:58,208 --> 01:04:01,879
Because they are making us believe that we are rich or wealthy

1101
01:04:02,045 --> 01:04:03,964
because we can buy many things.

1102
01:04:04,131 --> 01:04:06,758
But we actually are getting poorer.

1103
01:04:06,925 --> 01:04:09,553
And the only person who is getting richer

1104
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:12,389
It is the brand owner of Fast Fashion.

1105
01:04:12,723 --> 01:04:15,267
So that angers me a little.

1106
01:04:22,983 --> 01:04:25,736
You spoke of a commitment

1107
01:04:25,903 --> 01:04:31,408
promise to try to basic subsistence wages.

1108
01:04:32,034 --> 01:04:33,452
What does that mean?

1109
01:04:33,827 --> 01:04:37,289
How fair subsistence wages defined in Bangladesh?

1110
01:04:37,748 --> 01:04:41,210
You know? What does that mean?

1111
01:04:41,376 --> 01:04:44,213
"Having a pilot project in three factories"

1112
01:04:44,379 --> 01:04:49,051
and by 2018, 15% of their factories are going to have that?

1113
01:04:49,218 --> 01:04:51,470
That is not enough. it is not.

1114
01:04:51,929 --> 01:04:54,765
For us it is very clear that what is a living wage,

1115
01:04:54,932 --> 01:04:57,309
It is something that workers should say,

1116
01:04:57,476 --> 01:05:01,730
and that is incorporated into our way of working.

1117
01:05:01,897 --> 01:05:03,106
How much is it?

1118
01:05:03,273 --> 01:05:05,275
And we are not who should say how much,

1119
01:05:05,442 --> 01:05:07,736
but we do assessments all the time.

1120
01:05:07,903 --> 01:05:08,903
How much is it?

1121
01:05:08,946 --> 01:05:13,367
And to ensure that covers the basic needs of workers.

1122
01:05:13,825 --> 01:05:16,995
I can show it later.

1123
01:05:17,162 --> 01:05:19,748
H & M has dominated the fast fashion model,

1124
01:05:19,915 --> 01:05:23,168
becoming the second largest clothing company in history.

1125
01:05:23,335 --> 01:05:26,505
With annual revenues of over $ 18 billion dollars,

1126
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:29,466
Now they are one of the largest producers of clothes

1127
01:05:29,633 --> 01:05:32,094
in Bangladesh and Cambodia.

1128
01:05:32,344 --> 01:05:35,764
Unfortunately, like other large retailers who asked,

1129
01:05:35,931 --> 01:05:38,851
They refused to grant an interview for this film.

1130
01:05:45,732 --> 01:05:49,152
PHNOM PENH, CAMBODIA

1131
01:05:53,490 --> 01:05:56,285
In Cambodia, the garment workers are tired.

1132
01:05:56,451 --> 01:05:57,828
They recently took the streets

1133
01:05:57,995 --> 01:06:00,747
to demand a minimum wage increase in the country.

1134
01:06:06,336 --> 01:06:09,631
To continue the protests were met with violent repression,

1135
01:06:09,798 --> 01:06:13,302
as police opened fire with live ammunition.

1136
01:06:33,322 --> 01:06:35,782
A woman died and several people were injured

1137
01:06:35,949 --> 01:06:38,076
in clashes between workers of textile mills

1138
01:06:38,243 --> 01:06:40,204
and riot police in Cambodia.

1139
01:07:13,529 --> 01:07:17,991
For two days, Cambodia was a battleground.

1140
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:19,993
The city of Phnom Penh.

1141
01:07:20,244 --> 01:07:24,206
They brought to the police, paratroopers

1142
01:07:24,373 --> 01:07:28,877
as if there were a war in the streets of Phnom Penh.

1143
01:07:29,044 --> 01:07:32,840
Why? Because workers in the textile industry

1144
01:07:33,006 --> 01:07:34,758
still required

1145
01:07:35,092 --> 01:07:37,970
a minimum wage of at least $ 160.

1146
01:07:41,139 --> 01:07:43,809
The government violently repressed us, and as a result

1147
01:07:43,976 --> 01:07:46,186
five workers, 23 died were arrested,

1148
01:07:46,353 --> 01:07:48,647
and more than 40 wounded.

1149
01:07:48,814 --> 01:07:51,108
And actually we are not asking for much money.

1150
01:07:51,275 --> 01:07:56,572
We just want a proper wage to a decent life with dignity.

1151
01:07:56,738 --> 01:08:01,285
But the government does not care how poor we are

1152
01:08:01,451 --> 01:08:03,537
or how much suffering we endured.

1153
01:08:03,704 --> 01:08:05,706
They do not care workers at all.

1154
01:08:05,873 --> 01:08:11,003
So we continue to demand $ 160

1155
01:08:11,170 --> 01:08:13,463
a monthly minimum wage.

1156
01:08:15,716 --> 01:08:21,471
Today is the funeral of a factory worker.

1157
01:08:21,847 --> 01:08:25,309
He was beaten to death.

1158
01:08:25,893 --> 01:08:31,648
She had suffered greatly before dying this morning.

1159
01:08:31,899 --> 01:08:35,694
And he had not done anything wrong.

1160
01:08:35,861 --> 01:08:39,781
He, among his colleagues,

1161
01:08:40,949 --> 01:08:44,703
I wanted to have better living conditions.

1162
01:09:11,146 --> 01:09:14,816
Continue their fight

1163
01:09:15,692 --> 01:09:19,696
for all Cambodian workers

1164
01:09:19,863 --> 01:09:23,909
have decent living conditions.

1165
01:09:25,369 --> 01:09:27,037
Thank you sir.

1166
01:09:35,587 --> 01:09:38,590
The Cambodian government, like other developing countries,

1167
01:09:38,757 --> 01:09:42,553
desperately you need the business they bring multinational retailers.

1168
01:09:43,011 --> 01:09:44,888
By the constant threat of these brands

1169
01:09:45,055 --> 01:09:47,766
on the relocation of production to other low-cost countries,

1170
01:09:47,933 --> 01:09:49,810
the government keeps down wages,

1171
01:09:49,977 --> 01:09:52,855
systematically avoiding compliance with local labor laws.

1172
01:09:53,105 --> 01:09:56,191
But how are you officially marks do not employ workers,

1173
01:09:56,358 --> 01:09:59,027
or they own any factories where they produce,

1174
01:09:59,194 --> 01:10:01,071
they can make huge profits,

1175
01:10:01,238 --> 01:10:03,615
while remaining free of responsibility

1176
01:10:03,782 --> 01:10:06,910
the effects of precarious employment, Disaster factories,

1177
01:10:07,077 --> 01:10:10,080
and continued violent treatment of workers.

1178
01:10:10,289 --> 01:10:12,541
The whole system begins to seem

1179
01:10:12,708 --> 01:10:14,710
as a perfectly designed nightmare

1180
01:10:14,877 --> 01:10:17,296
for workers trapped inside.

1181
01:10:19,631 --> 01:10:24,219
They can not deceive, and exploit our human resources,

1182
01:10:24,386 --> 01:10:25,804
exploit our workers.

1183
01:10:25,971 --> 01:10:28,223
Workers continue rising.

1184
01:10:28,724 --> 01:10:32,019
I ask the international brands

1185
01:10:32,477 --> 01:10:38,066
to turn this fight in dollars,

1186
01:10:38,233 --> 01:10:40,986
in pounds, euros.

1187
01:10:41,737 --> 01:10:45,282
It translates into human capital.

1188
01:10:45,657 --> 01:10:49,995
It translates in social responsibility

1189
01:10:50,162 --> 01:10:51,705
of these large companies,

1190
01:10:51,872 --> 01:10:55,167
It translates into economic justice.

1191
01:10:55,334 --> 01:10:58,712
When everything is concentrated on making profits

1192
01:10:58,879 --> 01:11:00,422
for large companies,

1193
01:11:00,589 --> 01:11:02,132
we see that human rights,

1194
01:11:02,299 --> 01:11:05,594
the environment, labor rights are completely lost.

1195
01:11:05,761 --> 01:11:08,472
We see that workers are increasingly exploited

1196
01:11:08,639 --> 01:11:12,267
because it brings down the price lower all increasing,

1197
01:11:12,434 --> 01:11:16,188
simply to satisfy this urge to accumulate capital.

1198
01:11:16,355 --> 01:11:18,357
And that is deeply problematic,

1199
01:11:18,524 --> 01:11:20,943
because it leads to massive impoverishment

1200
01:11:21,109 --> 01:11:24,279
hundreds of millions of people worldwide.

1201
01:11:25,572 --> 01:11:27,908
If you write to any of these companies,

1202
01:11:28,075 --> 01:11:29,701
they send its Code of Conduct.

1203
01:11:29,868 --> 01:11:33,956
And it's beautiful, and says: "Yes, we take responsibility

1204
01:11:34,122 --> 01:11:36,834
conditions under which our product is made,

1205
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:38,335
the product you buy.

1206
01:11:38,502 --> 01:11:40,212
In all the factories where we produce,

1207
01:11:40,379 --> 01:11:44,383
we require them to abide by minimum wage laws,

1208
01:11:44,550 --> 01:11:46,343
all laws of the country,

1209
01:11:46,510 --> 01:11:49,721
respect women and not hire children,

1210
01:11:50,514 --> 01:11:52,349
no forced labor,

1211
01:11:53,392 --> 01:11:56,854
no excessive overtime, "all those things.

1212
01:11:58,647 --> 01:12:03,277
But when we introduced a bill in Congress a few years ago,

1213
01:12:03,443 --> 01:12:05,821
or we work with people to do it,

1214
01:12:05,988 --> 01:12:10,033
we call it "Law of decent working conditions and fair competition",

1215
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:12,953
the companies responded with one voice,

1216
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:15,789
"No! It would be an impediment to free trade.

1217
01:12:15,956 --> 01:12:19,585
There can be no rules. We can not pamper you! "

1218
01:12:19,751 --> 01:12:22,921
They want to keep with voluntary codes of conduct.

1219
01:12:23,505 --> 01:12:25,632
They have fought, and won,

1220
01:12:25,799 --> 01:12:29,887
by laws protecting their belongings and their interests,

1221
01:12:30,345 --> 01:12:32,014
but what about the workers?

1222
01:12:32,181 --> 01:12:34,433
There are only voluntary codes of conduct.

1223
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:38,812
And what we see in case after case after case,

1224
01:12:38,979 --> 01:12:41,064
is that these voluntary codes of conduct

1225
01:12:43,567 --> 01:12:47,112
We must recognize, particularly in the fashion sector,

1226
01:12:47,279 --> 01:12:50,657
that human capital is part of this miracle formula.

1227
01:12:51,867 --> 01:12:55,412
Without human capital, not cheap labor,

1228
01:12:55,579 --> 01:12:56,955
female hand cheap labor,

1229
01:12:57,122 --> 01:13:00,167
I would not be generating the profits it generates.

1230
01:13:01,418 --> 01:13:04,880
That has to be recognized, must be addressed,

1231
01:13:05,047 --> 01:13:08,467
and those people need to be rewarded and not exploited.

1232
01:13:08,634 --> 01:13:10,302
Where's your piece of the pie?

1233
01:13:10,469 --> 01:13:12,721
That is what we must constantly ask.

1234
01:13:12,888 --> 01:13:16,808
Are these immoral buyers? Or just not ... Or are they immoral?

1235
01:13:17,100 --> 01:13:19,561
The system for working and the system that allows

1236
01:13:19,728 --> 01:13:21,146
companies do it is amoral.

1237
01:13:21,313 --> 01:13:24,024
The persons concerned are merely products of that system

1238
01:13:24,191 --> 01:13:26,485
and they have to take it to its logical conclusion.

1239
01:13:26,652 --> 01:13:30,322
What we have to do is change how these businesses operate.

1240
01:13:30,656 --> 01:13:33,575
Operating in a system that only measures benefits,

1241
01:13:33,742 --> 01:13:35,911
companies have little incentive to do

1242
01:13:36,078 --> 01:13:38,997
nothing else to do that this quarter is better than the last.

1243
01:13:39,164 --> 01:13:41,875
Regardless of the damage to the road.

1244
01:13:42,251 --> 01:13:44,920
As companies in the global fashion industry,

1245
01:13:45,087 --> 01:13:47,881
leading brands, and seed and chemical companies,

1246
01:13:48,048 --> 01:13:51,802
today grow to a size and unprecedented global power.

1247
01:13:51,969 --> 01:13:55,722
This term profit at all costs, is beginning to be opposed

1248
01:13:55,889 --> 01:13:58,517
openly to the values ​​we share.

1249
01:13:59,935 --> 01:14:01,395
Richard Wolff es un economista,

1250
01:14:01,562 --> 01:14:05,148
that after graduating from Harvard, Stanford and Yale,

1251
01:14:05,315 --> 01:14:07,276
he was convinced that the real problem

1252
01:14:07,442 --> 01:14:09,278
it is within the system itself.

1253
01:14:09,444 --> 01:14:13,240
So the United States became a peculiar country.

1254
01:14:13,448 --> 01:14:15,284
You could criticize the educational system

1255
01:14:15,450 --> 01:14:16,535
to improve schools.

1256
01:14:16,702 --> 01:14:18,579
You could criticize the transport system

1257
01:14:18,745 --> 01:14:19,872
to work best.

1258
01:14:20,038 --> 01:14:20,789
You could crit ...

1259
01:14:20,956 --> 01:14:23,750
But you could not fault the economic system.

1260
01:14:23,917 --> 01:14:25,711
That had free pass.

1261
01:14:26,086 --> 01:14:27,462
You could not criticize ...

1262
01:14:28,213 --> 01:14:30,716
And if not critical thing for 50 years,

1263
01:14:30,883 --> 01:14:33,343
it rots, it decomposes.

1264
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:35,554
One of the ways that a healthy society works

1265
01:14:35,721 --> 01:14:39,641
It is subjected to criticism of its component systems,

1266
01:14:39,808 --> 01:14:42,269
to discuss it and hopefully fix it,

1267
01:14:42,436 --> 01:14:44,271
or improve it or make it better.

1268
01:14:44,438 --> 01:14:46,982
You could not question capitalism.

1269
01:14:47,149 --> 01:14:48,275
Capitalism is the reason

1270
01:14:48,442 --> 01:14:51,361
whereby the fashion industry is as today.

1271
01:14:51,528 --> 01:14:54,990
It is the reason why so little is paid to workers in Bangladesh.

1272
01:14:55,157 --> 01:14:57,868
Because if you're operating in a capitalist system,

1273
01:14:58,035 --> 01:15:00,996
the most important thing to do is to create benefits

1274
01:15:01,163 --> 01:15:04,666
and you need to create more profits than its competitors.

1275
01:15:04,833 --> 01:15:06,627
And this is what drives companies

1276
01:15:06,793 --> 01:15:09,880
to keep wages low and getting lower.

1277
01:15:10,047 --> 01:15:13,884
But companies do not go ... The fashion retailers

1278
01:15:14,051 --> 01:15:18,639
They do not go to places like Bangladesh for no other reason except

1279
01:15:18,805 --> 01:15:21,475
they can get cheaper labor can work.

1280
01:15:21,642 --> 01:15:24,019
No collective rights in Bangladesh,

1281
01:15:24,186 --> 01:15:25,646
no trade union rights,

1282
01:15:25,812 --> 01:15:27,689
There is a very, very low minimum wage,

1283
01:15:27,856 --> 01:15:30,901
no maternity benefits, no pensions,

1284
01:15:31,068 --> 01:15:33,362
It is why the fashion industry is in Bangladesh

1285
01:15:33,529 --> 01:15:36,740
because you can get the most benefits from these people

1286
01:15:36,907 --> 01:15:38,617
they are making clothes for them.

1287
01:15:38,784 --> 01:15:42,079
Before you can solve a problem, you have to admit you have it

1288
01:15:42,246 --> 01:15:44,331
and before going to fix an economic system

1289
01:15:44,498 --> 01:15:47,584
it is working in this way, and producing such stresses

1290
01:15:47,751 --> 01:15:51,421
and inequalities and problems in our community,

1291
01:15:51,588 --> 01:15:55,425
we have to face the real extent of the problem we have,

1292
01:15:55,592 --> 01:15:58,053
with the overall system.

1293
01:15:58,220 --> 01:15:59,429
And at least

1294
01:15:59,596 --> 01:16:02,140
we have to open a national debate on the subject,

1295
01:16:02,307 --> 01:16:05,727
and at most, I think we have to think long and hard

1296
01:16:05,894 --> 01:16:08,647
on alternative systems that might work better.

1297
01:16:08,814 --> 01:16:12,025
For the environment, the big threat is that capital

1298
01:16:12,192 --> 01:16:16,405
You should continue to expand infinitely to survive.

1299
01:16:16,572 --> 01:16:20,200
You can not have any limit to its expansion and growth.

1300
01:16:20,367 --> 01:16:22,870
The natural world clearly has limits.

1301
01:16:23,036 --> 01:16:26,540
There are definite limits on how it can support the world

1302
01:16:26,707 --> 01:16:29,042
in terms of production, in terms of trade,

1303
01:16:29,209 --> 01:16:31,461
in terms of transport and distribution.

1304
01:16:31,628 --> 01:16:34,006
And it is clear that we have already exceeded

1305
01:16:34,173 --> 01:16:37,259
Many of these limits, that is why we are seeing so much tension

1306
01:16:37,426 --> 01:16:39,845
in the natural world right now.

1307
01:16:40,012 --> 01:16:43,390
Most people do not want to live in a system like this.

1308
01:16:43,599 --> 01:16:46,518
I think it's a system that makes most people very unhappy,

1309
01:16:46,685 --> 01:16:49,938
and I do not think people want to live on a planet that is dying slowly

1310
01:16:50,105 --> 01:16:53,066
or be exploiting their neighbors.

1311
01:16:53,317 --> 01:16:56,737
I think we need a huge systemic change.

1312
01:16:57,196 --> 01:16:59,656
If the system does not change,

1313
01:16:59,823 --> 01:17:02,367
It is being left intact

1314
01:17:02,534 --> 01:17:05,579
decisions of these companies,

1315
01:17:05,746 --> 01:17:08,957
meaning that a small group of executives and shareholders

1316
01:17:09,124 --> 01:17:11,502
They will be working on the same system,

1317
01:17:11,668 --> 01:17:14,546
subject to the same pattern of rewards and punishments,

1318
01:17:14,713 --> 01:17:18,133
that sooner or later it makes impose again,

1319
01:17:18,300 --> 01:17:19,635
there or elsewhere,

1320
01:17:19,801 --> 01:17:22,221
the same conditions against which they are fighting.

1321
01:17:22,387 --> 01:17:25,682
So leave it to improve their conditions,

1322
01:17:25,849 --> 01:17:29,770
do against the computer or otherwise do not speak seriously.

1323
01:17:29,978 --> 01:17:33,065
Our economic system is consumer capitalism,

1324
01:17:33,232 --> 01:17:37,819
and so the government needs to have consumption

1325
01:17:37,986 --> 01:17:39,530
at very high levels,

1326
01:17:39,947 --> 01:17:41,865
like companies, of course,

1327
01:17:42,032 --> 01:17:44,910
and so at some level, most people accept.

1328
01:17:45,410 --> 01:17:47,730
I've lost count of the people I spoke to said:

1329
01:17:47,829 --> 01:17:52,543
"Well, if we become less materialistic economy would collapse."

1330
01:17:52,709 --> 01:17:57,589
Well, they're right in a sense, because our economy

1331
01:17:57,756 --> 01:18:03,303
is based on materialism, it is based on such securities.

1332
01:18:03,470 --> 01:18:06,223
That's what it needs to survive.

1333
01:18:06,390 --> 01:18:08,475
That's part of the fuel it needs.

1334
01:18:09,226 --> 01:18:11,937
The problem is that it has a high price.

1335
01:18:12,187 --> 01:18:15,274
Black Friday is here we go, please?

1336
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:18,360
Go, go, go buy, buy, buy

1337
01:18:18,527 --> 01:18:19,820
Black Friday Hysteria

1338
01:18:19,987 --> 01:18:22,155
continues in shopping centers.

1339
01:18:22,322 --> 01:18:24,199
In some parts of the country tonight,

1340
01:18:24,366 --> 01:18:25,659
It is as if someone announced

1341
01:18:25,826 --> 01:18:27,703
we are in danger of running out of things,

1342
01:18:27,870 --> 01:18:30,581
and those who need something have to go out and buy now

1343
01:18:30,747 --> 01:18:32,416
because it will disappear forever.

1344
01:18:32,583 --> 01:18:35,419
Walmart, she made more than 10 million transactions

1345
01:18:35,586 --> 01:18:37,588
in the first four hours of hysteria.

1346
01:18:37,754 --> 01:18:43,177
A record 15 000 people at Macy's in New York, buyers resist.

1347
01:18:43,343 --> 01:18:46,638
Black Friday is the longest day of the year sales.

1348
01:18:46,805 --> 01:18:50,225
Certainly in the case of Macy's. We'll have more sales this day

1349
01:18:50,434 --> 01:18:52,936
than any other day of the year.

1350
01:18:53,103 --> 01:18:58,025
This Christmas shopping spree shows that the country rose!

1351
01:18:58,192 --> 01:19:00,903
We are once again ... Yes!

1352
01:19:01,445 --> 01:19:02,946
Yes!

1353
01:19:03,780 --> 01:19:07,618
We are once again spending money we do not have

1354
01:19:07,784 --> 01:19:11,246
things that do not need to give people we do not like.

1355
01:19:13,874 --> 01:19:18,712
¡IN. IT.! ¡IN. IT.! ¡IN. IT.! ¡IN. IT.!

1356
01:19:24,259 --> 01:19:25,844
OMG!

1357
01:21:31,136 --> 01:21:33,722
They love her

1358
01:21:33,889 --> 01:21:36,058
and possibly take care of it better than me.

1359
01:21:36,225 --> 01:21:38,519
However, one thing makes me sad.

1360
01:21:38,685 --> 01:21:40,646
No matter how much someone wants it,

1361
01:21:40,896 --> 01:21:43,774
no one can love a child's parents.

1362
01:21:44,399 --> 01:21:47,611
I feel heartbroken.

1363
01:22:00,958 --> 01:22:07,756
I do not want my daughter to have to work in a garment factory like me.

1364
01:22:08,257 --> 01:22:13,428
I feel bad, but I think I'll be happy one days

1365
01:22:13,595 --> 01:22:16,348
when she has a good future.

1366
01:22:16,515 --> 01:22:20,143
It will be a good human being and people will say,

1367
01:22:20,310 --> 01:22:23,146
although Shima worked in a garment factory

1368
01:22:23,313 --> 01:22:26,441
and he stayed in Dhaka, away from her daughter,

1369
01:22:26,608 --> 01:22:28,277
He gave him a good education to her daughter

1370
01:22:28,443 --> 01:22:29,903
and raised her as a good human being.

1371
01:22:30,070 --> 01:22:33,365
If you get a good job in government, or marries a good man,

1372
01:22:33,532 --> 01:22:39,496
then people will say and I will be very proud of that.

1373
01:22:39,955 --> 01:22:42,332
Yes, I fought,

1374
01:22:42,499 --> 01:22:45,252
but I did my best not to let her go through this.

1375
01:22:45,419 --> 01:22:48,005
As well screams.

1376
01:22:51,925 --> 01:22:55,637
I grew up on a farm, I married a guy who grew up on a farm,

1377
01:22:55,804 --> 01:22:59,766
and those who live on the farm, we live there,

1378
01:22:59,933 --> 01:23:02,477
It has to be safe for us too.

1379
01:23:02,644 --> 01:23:04,313
And the new chemicals

1380
01:23:04,479 --> 01:23:08,525
and intensity of use, continued to rise.

1381
01:23:08,692 --> 01:23:13,155
And then in 2005,

1382
01:23:15,199 --> 01:23:18,202
Terry began to have loss of fine motor skills,

1383
01:23:18,368 --> 01:23:20,204
and this and that, and she discovered

1384
01:23:20,370 --> 01:23:23,999
I had glioblastoma multiforme, a brain tumor in stage 4

1385
01:23:25,083 --> 01:23:28,629
and in the fullness of his 47 years.

1386
01:23:30,047 --> 01:23:31,715
He died at age 50.

1387
01:23:32,090 --> 01:23:34,510
We got six months, we had two and a half years,

1388
01:23:34,676 --> 01:23:38,680
and the neurosurgeon who operated on him, Lubbock,

1389
01:23:38,847 --> 01:23:43,769
It has immense cancer clinics and a medical center.

1390
01:23:44,520 --> 01:23:47,281
We did not have to go elsewhere for that brain tumor operate.

1391
01:23:47,314 --> 01:23:49,066
We could stay here

1392
01:23:49,233 --> 01:23:51,151
because it makes many operations.

1393
01:23:51,318 --> 01:23:55,072
He said that this type of tumor found in men, 45 to 65,

1394
01:23:55,239 --> 01:23:59,910
working in agriculture, or oilfields.

1395
01:24:00,202 --> 01:24:03,622
And although I have no hard evidence, no blood test to tell

1396
01:24:03,789 --> 01:24:08,961
The use of cotton chemicals, agricultural chemicals,

1397
01:24:09,127 --> 01:24:11,463
led directly to the death of my husband,

1398
01:24:11,630 --> 01:24:14,174
there are too many connections with the death of his father.

1399
01:24:14,341 --> 01:24:16,718
He grew up on a farm with intensive use of chemicals,

1400
01:24:16,885 --> 01:24:19,638
We live amid 1.2 million hectares of cotton,

1401
01:24:19,805 --> 01:24:21,431
using many chemicals.

1402
01:24:21,598 --> 01:24:23,934
And those moments,

1403
01:24:24,852 --> 01:24:27,187
organic was no longer important to me,

1404
01:24:28,397 --> 01:24:29,773
it was imperative.

1405
01:24:29,940 --> 01:24:32,359
It is imperative that we change agriculture.

1406
01:24:32,526 --> 01:24:35,988
It is imperative, if we talk about the long-term sustainability

1407
01:24:36,154 --> 01:24:38,657
and welfare of our lives on this planet,

1408
01:24:38,824 --> 01:24:40,742
and the lives of our children on the planet,

1409
01:24:40,909 --> 01:24:42,995
we have to change.

1410
01:25:06,435 --> 01:25:08,353
It is the beginning of a turning point,

1411
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:11,023
not only for a responsible fashion to make way,

1412
01:25:11,190 --> 01:25:13,066
but a new form of capitalism,

1413
01:25:13,233 --> 01:25:15,194
for a new form of economy.

1414
01:25:15,569 --> 01:25:20,657
I'm sure we'll see a significant change

1415
01:25:20,824 --> 01:25:22,576
over the next ten years.

1416
01:25:22,993 --> 01:25:25,537
If you arrive on time or not it is another matter.

1417
01:25:27,539 --> 01:25:29,333
Martin Luther King Jr.,

1418
01:25:29,499 --> 01:25:31,877
in a speech at a church in Brooklyn, he said

1419
01:25:32,044 --> 01:25:35,422
what America needed was a revolution of values.

1420
01:25:35,589 --> 01:25:38,342
She had to stop treating people as things.

1421
01:25:38,634 --> 01:25:41,803
She had to stop treating people in a way

1422
01:25:41,970 --> 01:25:43,514
it was just about profits.

1423
01:25:43,680 --> 01:25:47,976
And however treat people in a real and human way.

1424
01:25:48,393 --> 01:25:51,271
OMG! We can make things better!

1425
01:25:51,438 --> 01:25:56,902
If we want to disseminate, and I would say yes,

1426
01:25:57,069 --> 01:26:00,906
industry spread throughout the world, not concentrate in one place.

1427
01:26:01,073 --> 01:26:05,327
Allow benefits are shared globally,

1428
01:26:05,494 --> 01:26:10,958
then let's do it in an orderly fashion, reasonable, carefully.

1429
01:26:11,124 --> 01:26:14,002
We must recognize that capital is only money.

1430
01:26:14,503 --> 01:26:15,671
Money is a means,

1431
01:26:15,879 --> 01:26:18,674
and people should be accountable for how it is used.

1432
01:26:18,841 --> 01:26:23,637
We have to celebrate the creative power of human beings.

1433
01:26:23,804 --> 01:26:25,556
And we talk about the creative work,

1434
01:26:25,722 --> 01:26:27,808
We should stop talking about labor.

1435
01:26:28,016 --> 01:26:32,354
We have to look at the earth not as a commodity,

1436
01:26:32,980 --> 01:26:35,107
with which it is speculated and markets,

1437
01:26:35,274 --> 01:26:38,694
but as the very basis of our life, as Mother Earth.

1438
01:26:38,986 --> 01:26:42,030
It becomes all consumer activists,

1439
01:26:42,531 --> 01:26:44,616
all consumers make ethical questions,

1440
01:26:44,783 --> 01:26:47,911
all consumers do very simple questions about

1441
01:26:48,078 --> 01:26:49,621
where it comes from his clothes,

1442
01:26:49,788 --> 01:26:51,039
all consumers say:

1443
01:26:51,206 --> 01:26:55,169
"Sorry, it is not acceptable for someone to die while working".

1444
01:26:55,335 --> 01:26:58,505
We can not turn around and say. "Yeah, go do whatever you want."

1445
01:26:58,672 --> 01:27:01,383
It is too important, the sector is too important.

1446
01:27:01,550 --> 01:27:06,013
Have too much impact and effect on millions of people around the world,

1447
01:27:06,180 --> 01:27:08,015
and common resources.

1448
01:27:13,979 --> 01:27:16,106
We continue seeking happiness

1449
01:27:16,273 --> 01:27:18,233
consumption of thing?

1450
01:27:19,067 --> 01:27:22,613
Are we going to be satisfied with a system that makes us feel rich,

1451
01:27:22,779 --> 01:27:25,490
while leaving our desperately poor world?

1452
01:27:25,991 --> 01:27:27,826
Will we continue to turn a blind eye

1453
01:27:27,993 --> 01:27:30,329
to the lives of those who are behind our clothes?

1454
01:27:30,495 --> 01:27:33,749
Or will there be a turning point, a new chapter in our history,

1455
01:27:33,916 --> 01:27:36,960
when together we begin to make a real change,

1456
01:27:37,127 --> 01:27:42,049
to remember that all the clothes we wear was made by human hands?

1457
01:27:42,758 --> 01:27:45,594
Amidst all the challenges we face today,

1458
01:27:45,761 --> 01:27:48,138
despite all the problems that seem to excel

1459
01:27:48,305 --> 01:27:50,015
and beyond our control,

1460
01:27:50,182 --> 01:27:51,767
maybe we could start here,

1461
01:27:52,100 --> 01:27:53,685
clothing.
