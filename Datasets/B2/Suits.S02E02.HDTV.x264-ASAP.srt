1
00:00:08,517 --> 00:00:10,822
Hey, Mike, it's Rachel.

2
00:00:10,823 --> 00:00:12,090
I know I shouldn't
be doing this.

3
00:00:12,158 --> 00:00:13,425
I know you're seeing Jenny,

4
00:00:13,492 --> 00:00:15,427
but I can't stop thinking
about the kiss,

5
00:00:15,494 --> 00:00:17,762
and I can't go back.

6
00:00:27,773 --> 00:00:29,708
[Elevator dings]

7
00:00:32,445 --> 00:00:35,513
Morning, Jessica.

8
00:00:35,581 --> 00:00:37,082
Ms. Pearson.

9
00:00:37,149 --> 00:00:39,284
Hey, I just wanna
thank you so much

10
00:00:39,352 --> 00:00:42,887
for keeping me on despite the...

11
00:00:42,955 --> 00:00:44,489
I guess, I just
want to let you know

12
00:00:44,557 --> 00:00:46,891
that I'm gonna work hard,

13
00:00:46,959 --> 00:00:50,662
and I'm gonna... you know,
I'm gonna make you proud.

14
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:53,832
Not... not like a son...
you know...

15
00:00:53,899 --> 00:00:58,837
I mean, we don't really
look that much alike, I guess.

16
00:00:58,904 --> 00:01:00,739
That's a... that's
a strange thing to say.

17
00:01:00,806 --> 00:01:03,575
Uh, I just... what I meant
is that I really appreciate

18
00:01:03,643 --> 00:01:05,877
everything that you... okay.

19
00:01:05,945 --> 00:01:09,514
[Construction sounds]

20
00:01:09,582 --> 00:01:11,282
- Hardman?
- One would assume.

21
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:13,752
- Did he ask you?
- No, he did not.

22
00:01:15,921 --> 00:01:17,155
He needs your signature.

23
00:01:17,223 --> 00:01:20,191
And yet there was a wall
here yesterday.

24
00:01:20,259 --> 00:01:22,527
Well, at least he didn't ask
for his office back.

25
00:01:22,595 --> 00:01:23,828
I wouldn't have given it back.

26
00:01:23,896 --> 00:01:25,430
I wouldn't have given
yours back to you.

27
00:01:25,498 --> 00:01:28,266
Unless you asked really nicely.

28
00:01:28,334 --> 00:01:30,368
Isn't that...

29
00:01:30,436 --> 00:01:32,404
- Mine.
- Shot across the bow.

30
00:01:32,471 --> 00:01:34,205
No, an act of war.

31
00:01:34,273 --> 00:01:36,074
I love the smell of napalm
in the morning.

32
00:01:36,142 --> 00:01:37,876
[Sighs]

33
00:01:37,943 --> 00:01:40,078
It's not taupe.

34
00:01:40,146 --> 00:01:41,846
The color, the walls.

35
00:01:41,914 --> 00:01:43,415
Hardman asked for taupe.

36
00:01:43,482 --> 00:01:45,483
I mean, it might be tan,

37
00:01:45,551 --> 00:01:47,118
or beige with a hint of mauve.

38
00:01:47,186 --> 00:01:48,286
But it definitely isn't taupe,

39
00:01:48,354 --> 00:01:49,354
and don't try to tell me
that it is.

40
00:01:49,422 --> 00:01:50,922
Hey, Louis, what color shades

41
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:52,190
would go well
with these taupe walls?

42
00:01:52,258 --> 00:01:54,125
- Enough.
- I didn't even say anything.

43
00:01:54,193 --> 00:01:55,994
Did you want something?

44
00:01:56,062 --> 00:01:57,862
Yes, chain of command
is everything to me.

45
00:01:57,930 --> 00:01:59,230
If I don't know
who to answer to,

46
00:01:59,298 --> 00:02:01,332
I might as well be living
naked on a kibbutz

47
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,767
in the middle of Africa.

48
00:02:02,835 --> 00:02:04,869
An option worth considering,
though we'd miss you.

49
00:02:04,937 --> 00:02:05,870
[Mouths silently] Not really.

50
00:02:05,938 --> 00:02:07,205
Your point?

51
00:02:07,273 --> 00:02:08,306
Who do I work for?

52
00:02:08,374 --> 00:02:09,741
I assume I work for you,

53
00:02:09,809 --> 00:02:11,576
but Hardman just asked me
to personally summarize

54
00:02:11,644 --> 00:02:12,711
every case at this firm.

55
00:02:12,778 --> 00:02:14,179
And I was hoping maybe
that you can

56
00:02:14,246 --> 00:02:15,747
let him know that
I answer to you.

57
00:02:15,815 --> 00:02:18,216
You do answer to me, Louis.

58
00:02:18,284 --> 00:02:20,151
And Daniel and I are
on the same page on this.

59
00:02:20,219 --> 00:02:23,822
You're the right man
for the job.

60
00:02:23,889 --> 00:02:26,991
Well, thank you,
that's all I needed to hear.

61
00:02:29,261 --> 00:02:30,962
Why'd you lie?

62
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:32,130
Because you don't
let the children know

63
00:02:32,198 --> 00:02:35,133
that mommy and
daddy are fighting.

64
00:02:59,492 --> 00:03:00,692
Uh, Rachel.

65
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,694
Hi. I'm busy.

66
00:03:02,762 --> 00:03:03,728
Oh, okay. How's it going?

67
00:03:03,796 --> 00:03:06,131
Busy, so if you don't mind, I...

68
00:03:06,198 --> 00:03:09,501
I need to talk to you
for a second, okay?

69
00:03:09,568 --> 00:03:10,869
- Okay.
- Okay.

70
00:03:10,936 --> 00:03:12,971
So Zane, I need you.

71
00:03:13,038 --> 00:03:14,873
In my office. Now.

72
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:16,441
- You were saying?
- I just, um...

73
00:03:16,509 --> 00:03:18,843
What part of "now"
wasn't clear?

74
00:03:18,911 --> 00:03:20,445
Ugh.

75
00:03:20,513 --> 00:03:22,247
By the time I'm in my chair.

76
00:03:22,314 --> 00:03:23,248
I should probably go.

77
00:03:23,315 --> 00:03:26,751
No, I...

78
00:03:37,496 --> 00:03:40,431
I got your message.

Good, give me a gun
and tell me where to point it.

Hardman has designs on my job.

92
00:04:40,146 --> 00:04:41,446
He's gonna need a power base.

93
00:04:41,514 --> 00:04:44,049
I need to make sure
every department is happy.

94
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:45,250
I can't do that alone.

There was a thing once...

99
00:04:53,192 --> 00:04:56,027
with a guy.

100
00:04:56,095 --> 00:04:57,496
With a couple of guys.

101
00:04:57,563 --> 00:04:58,930

Why don't you join us?

105
00:05:04,203 --> 00:05:05,237
Oh, thanks. Love to.

106
00:05:05,304 --> 00:05:07,406
- Taxes?
- Oh... no.

107
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:09,040
- Mergers?
- Hate him.

108
00:05:09,108 --> 00:05:10,442
- But I...
- Didn't work.

109
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:12,544
- Really?
- I am tied in, Harvey.

110
00:05:12,612 --> 00:05:14,513
There are a lot of underbelly
things that I can tell you,

111
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,047
but trust me,
this is not one of them.

112
00:05:16,115 --> 00:05:18,183
- Even Norma knows.
- What?

113
00:05:18,251 --> 00:05:20,218
People just don't like that
he's right all the time.

114
00:05:20,286 --> 00:05:21,920
You think I like it?

115
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:23,789
What's his standing
in bankruptcy?

116
00:05:23,856 --> 00:05:25,457
Excellent. I think.

117
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:26,892
We don't do a lot of work
with bankruptcy.

118
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:28,226
Remind me to fire you.

119
00:05:28,294 --> 00:05:30,929
Remind me to give you a raise.

120
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:32,798
Bankruptcy.

121
00:05:32,865 --> 00:05:34,266
I need you to court
Paul Porter.

122
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:36,601
You don't have some hot coals
I could walk across instead?

123
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:37,702
I don't like him either.

124
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:38,937
He's always been dubious of me.

125
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:40,005
I don't know if it's because

126
00:05:40,072 --> 00:05:41,406
I'm a woman or black or maybe

127
00:05:41,474 --> 00:05:42,641
he just doesn't like...

128
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:43,742
Your overbearing nature?

129
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:45,677
Your holier-than-thou attitude?

130
00:05:45,745 --> 00:05:47,913
This is not a joke, Harvey.

131
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,748
How this is gonna
go down is he's...

132
00:05:49,816 --> 00:05:51,183
I know, he's gonna
worm his way in,

133
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,517
and then one day,
call for a vote.

134
00:05:52,585 --> 00:05:55,287
And when that day comes,
every vote will count.

135
00:05:55,354 --> 00:05:58,056
- Even Paul's.
- Hardman is awesome.

136
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:03,261
I mean, he, um, brought in this
omelet bar for the associates,

137
00:06:03,329 --> 00:06:07,199
but it's no... big deal.

138
00:06:07,266 --> 00:06:08,934
Really good.

139
00:06:09,001 --> 00:06:14,406
This pineapple was growing on
a plantation on Lanai yesterday.

140
00:06:14,474 --> 00:06:17,509
Do not trust it.

141
00:06:17,577 --> 00:06:19,177
Don't trust the pineapple?

142
00:06:19,245 --> 00:06:20,212
Hardman.

143
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:21,480
Would you... come on.

144
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:22,547
- I don't want it.
- Are you serious?

145
00:06:22,615 --> 00:06:24,015
You're afraid of the pineapple?

146
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:25,484
I know it's got a rough
exterior, but it's all sweet

147
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:26,885
on the inside, I promise.

148
00:06:26,953 --> 00:06:28,653
"Come on. I love you, Harvey."

149
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:31,556
It'll be good for you.

150
00:06:31,624 --> 00:06:33,558
- Mmm.
- See?

151
00:06:33,626 --> 00:06:34,559
It's spectacular.

152
00:06:34,627 --> 00:06:35,827
But this doesn't change
the fact

153
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:36,828
that this is what he does.

154
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:38,063
He's coming back and people

155
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:39,064
are gonna have to choose sides.

156
00:06:39,131 --> 00:06:41,399
Can I choose his side?

157
00:06:41,467 --> 00:06:42,634
Sure.

158
00:06:42,702 --> 00:06:44,603
Support a man you never met
over a partner

159
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:46,104
who knows you never
went to Harvard,

160
00:06:46,172 --> 00:06:49,774
knows you're not really a lawyer
and is keeping you on anyway.

161
00:06:49,842 --> 00:06:52,010
Jessica it is.

162
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:53,845
Ready to serve.

163
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:55,814
I need you on Paul Porter.

164
00:06:55,882 --> 00:06:58,550
- The bowtie guy?
- Every case he has...

165
00:06:58,618 --> 00:07:00,285
read, summarize,
find weaknesses.

166
00:07:00,353 --> 00:07:01,453
I want to know
everything he knows.

167
00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:02,687
- What, is he getting fired?
- Nope.

168
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:05,323
He's getting lunch.

169
00:07:05,391 --> 00:07:07,392
So, Hardman's back.

170
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,594
It's interesting stuff, huh?

171
00:07:09,662 --> 00:07:11,162
Lots to talk about.

172
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:13,431
Do you have a question, Louis?

173
00:07:13,499 --> 00:07:14,533
Yes.

174
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:18,637
I mean, you know Jessica.

175
00:07:18,704 --> 00:07:20,705
That's not a question.

176
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:24,509
- She seems bothered.
- Huh. Still not a question.

177
00:07:24,577 --> 00:07:26,311
Hardman was managing partner,
now she's managing partner.

178
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:27,646
Do you even know
what a question is?

179
00:07:27,713 --> 00:07:29,814
Donna... look.
I need information.

180
00:07:29,882 --> 00:07:31,983
Now I wanna know what
the whole story is

181
00:07:32,051 --> 00:07:34,286
so I can formulate
some sort of strategy.

182
00:07:34,353 --> 00:07:39,691
You mean formulate
whose ass to kiss?

183
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,626
I have two house seats
to the stage reading

184
00:07:41,694 --> 00:07:44,396
of a new Albee play.

185
00:07:44,463 --> 00:07:46,998
- Edward Albee?
- Yes.

186
00:07:47,066 --> 00:07:49,167
Meryl Streep... [Gasps]

187
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:52,404
And Glenn Close.

188
00:07:52,471 --> 00:07:54,039
No!

189
00:07:54,106 --> 00:07:57,642
- We can go.
- No. No.

190
00:08:05,284 --> 00:08:07,852
I cannot tell you
what I do not know, Louis.

191
00:08:11,924 --> 00:08:12,857
Okay.

192
00:08:12,925 --> 00:08:16,161
Well, you know where they are.

193
00:08:16,228 --> 00:08:19,397
Curtain's at 8:00.

194
00:08:23,235 --> 00:08:27,372
[Clears throat]

195
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,376
[Clears throat again]

196
00:08:31,444 --> 00:08:34,379
Hi.

197
00:08:34,447 --> 00:08:36,414
Wait a minute,
I kiss you like that

198
00:08:36,482 --> 00:08:38,216
and all you have
to say to me is "hi"?

199
00:08:38,284 --> 00:08:39,351
Come on, admit it.

200
00:08:39,418 --> 00:08:41,052
I kind of rocked your world.

201
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,557
Look, Mike,
it was a good kiss, but...

202
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:47,292
Oh...

203
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,595
Jenny?

204
00:08:50,663 --> 00:08:55,600
We broke up.

205
00:08:55,668 --> 00:09:01,539
It turns out I kind of have
feelings for this other girl.

206
00:09:01,607 --> 00:09:05,210
So... it's over?

207
00:09:09,582 --> 00:09:12,150
Well, um, in that case,

208
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:14,953
then, yes, it was a good kiss.

209
00:09:15,021 --> 00:09:20,091
But just so we're clear,
I rocked your world.

210
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:24,629
You did.

211
00:09:24,697 --> 00:09:26,364
[Whispering] Now tell me
what would you say...

212
00:09:26,432 --> 00:09:28,533
[Loudly]
to helping me with my work

213
00:09:28,601 --> 00:09:31,202
in a professional capacity?

214
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:33,338
Smooth.

215
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:35,273
Actually, you know what,
you could.

216
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:37,842
I have to summarize all those
cases in bankruptcy over there.

217
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,244
It's funny because
I have to summarize

218
00:09:39,311 --> 00:09:42,313
all of the cases at the firm.

219
00:09:42,381 --> 00:09:43,815
For Hardman.

220
00:09:43,883 --> 00:09:46,317
Ooh.

221
00:09:46,385 --> 00:09:48,019
So you don't like him. I don't.

222
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:52,490
You wanna tell me why
over dinner?

223
00:09:52,558 --> 00:09:54,259
- Are you asking me out...
- On a date?

224
00:09:54,326 --> 00:09:56,695
Yeah, I am.

225
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:57,862
To talk about Hardman?

226
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,164
Hardman who?

227
00:09:59,231 --> 00:10:00,999
No, I wanna talk about
our kiss.

228
00:10:01,067 --> 00:10:02,634
And when I say, "talk about,"
I mean repeat.

229
00:10:02,702 --> 00:10:04,602
[Whispering]
And when I say, "kiss," I mean...

230
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:06,638
[loudly]
Redacting all those phone calls

231
00:10:06,706 --> 00:10:07,872
in the Slessinger filing.

232
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,941
Mmhmm. Getting better.

233
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:11,710
- Quick study.
- A date it is.

234
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:12,877
And by "date" I mean...

235
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:16,381
- Okay, no more of this.
- Yeah, of course.

236
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:24,055
So this is what it's like, huh?

237
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:25,423
This is what what's like?

238
00:10:25,491 --> 00:10:29,461
Being closed by Harvey Specter.

239
00:10:29,528 --> 00:10:31,229
I don't resent it.

240
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:32,897
It's a great meal, great table.

241
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:35,100
But let's not pretend
it's not self-serving.

242
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:37,702
Hardman is back.

243
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:39,637
Jessica doesn't want
to go back to the kitchen.

244
00:10:39,705 --> 00:10:42,807
Jessica Pearson
was never the "housewife."

245
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:45,977
You know where
my office is, Harvey?

246
00:10:46,045 --> 00:10:47,645
46.

247
00:10:47,713 --> 00:10:51,082
I've been knocked down
three floors in five years

248
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,984
on Jessica's watch.

249
00:10:53,052 --> 00:10:54,285
We have to look into that.

250
00:10:54,353 --> 00:10:55,887
I don't want a new office.

251
00:10:55,955 --> 00:10:57,489
I want respect.

252
00:10:57,556 --> 00:11:01,326
What you want is for someone
to help you with Madison 25.

253
00:11:01,393 --> 00:11:03,361
You've done your homework.

254
00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:05,663
You are about
to lose a huge client, Paul.

255
00:11:05,731 --> 00:11:06,731
I don't want to close you.

256
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:08,166
Let me close him.

257
00:11:08,234 --> 00:11:11,202
The problem is Tom Klapperich.
He's like you.

258
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:13,738
He thinks he knows
better than everyone.

259
00:11:13,806 --> 00:11:15,840
Truth is he doesn't know his ass
from a hole in the ground.

260
00:11:15,908 --> 00:11:18,009
He needs to declare bankruptcy

261
00:11:18,077 --> 00:11:19,244
and he doesn't wanna hear that.

262
00:11:19,311 --> 00:11:20,612
Well, let me keep him
in the family

263
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:24,415
in exchange
for backing Jessica.

264
00:11:24,483 --> 00:11:26,851
Well, you close him,
then we'll talk.

265
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:28,853
That's not so reassuring.

266
00:11:28,921 --> 00:11:31,589
You came to me.

267
00:11:31,657 --> 00:11:34,125
I didn't come to you.

268
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:35,660
I'll see you on the first tee.

269
00:11:35,728 --> 00:11:37,962
No, you won't.

270
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:40,198
Oh, is this where
you make your threat?

271
00:11:40,266 --> 00:11:42,467
I've had the carrot,
now I get the stick?

272
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:44,502
That's not my style.

273
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:46,905
The person you're gonna meet
on the tee is Fred Couples.

274
00:11:46,972 --> 00:11:48,907
And just so we're clear,

275
00:11:48,974 --> 00:11:52,577
that's being closed
by Harvey Specter.

276
00:12:01,483 --> 00:12:03,070
Let's talk football.

277
00:12:03,095 --> 00:12:06,064
Peyton Manning goes down
you lose your first 13 games.

278
00:12:06,793 --> 00:12:09,178
You gotta protect your assets
and build for the future.

279
00:12:09,181 --> 00:12:10,681
You don't wanna pay
28 million for a guy

280
00:12:10,749 --> 00:12:12,283
who may not play next year.

281
00:12:12,351 --> 00:12:13,518
So what do you do?

282
00:12:13,585 --> 00:12:14,519
You move on.

283
00:12:14,586 --> 00:12:16,287
The season isn't over, Harvey.

284
00:12:16,355 --> 00:12:18,222
You're 200 million in the red

285
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:20,558
with 1/4 billion due
in two days.

286
00:12:20,626 --> 00:12:24,228
Madison 25
is going to be built.

287
00:12:24,296 --> 00:12:28,266
Madison 25 should be built,
but the market's changed.

288
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:30,268
Vacancies are up,
rents are down,

289
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:31,936
and you can't take out
a loan against your future

290
00:12:32,004 --> 00:12:33,404
if the money's
never gonna flow.

291
00:12:33,472 --> 00:12:35,773
It's time to protect
your franchise.

292
00:12:35,841 --> 00:12:37,175
Really? I should just skate

293
00:12:37,242 --> 00:12:39,210
while the hundreds of
contractors and subcontractors

294
00:12:39,278 --> 00:12:41,312
that I've made financial
commitments to,

295
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:43,614
they should just wait in line
with their hands held out,

296
00:12:43,682 --> 00:12:45,283
hoping for 50¢ on the dollar?

297
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:47,919
They know how
the business works.

298
00:12:47,986 --> 00:12:50,321
Look, I know that Paul feels
I should protect myself.

299
00:12:50,389 --> 00:12:51,422
I should protect
my family business,

300
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:54,358
but I want to protect
my family name.

301
00:12:54,426 --> 00:12:57,762
There's no shame
in declaring bankruptcy, okay?

302
00:12:57,830 --> 00:12:59,697
It's a tool that
will allow you to survive.

303
00:12:59,765 --> 00:13:02,066
Wanna know the kind of guy
I am, Harvey?

304
00:13:02,134 --> 00:13:04,068
I'm the kind of guy,

305
00:13:04,136 --> 00:13:07,705
that when the clock says,
"The game's over, take a knee,"

306
00:13:07,773 --> 00:13:09,707
that's when
I throw a hail Mary.

307
00:13:09,775 --> 00:13:12,877
Everybody throws a hail Mary
when they got nothing to lose.

308
00:13:12,945 --> 00:13:15,246
You got something to lose.

309
00:13:15,314 --> 00:13:16,881
I like long odds.

310
00:13:16,949 --> 00:13:19,884
Let's just say,
I won't declare bankruptcy.

311
00:13:19,952 --> 00:13:22,820
What are my other options?

312
00:13:22,888 --> 00:13:25,656
I have an idea.

313
00:13:36,068 --> 00:13:37,201
You were right...

314
00:13:37,269 --> 00:13:38,736
about Hardman and Jessica.

315
00:13:38,804 --> 00:13:42,440
- You want something from me.
- I do.

316
00:13:42,507 --> 00:13:44,909
Mike needs an extension
on a $1/4 billion loan.

317
00:13:44,977 --> 00:13:47,345
And you want me to believe
that you're here for Mike?

318
00:13:47,412 --> 00:13:48,446
Yes.

319
00:13:48,513 --> 00:13:50,615
- Mm-mm.
- Mm-mm.

320
00:13:50,682 --> 00:13:53,017
Harvey needs me.

321
00:13:53,085 --> 00:13:55,987
I know you're amazing
at dealing with banks, Louis.

322
00:13:56,054 --> 00:13:57,255
[Laughs] What, do you think

323
00:13:57,322 --> 00:13:59,023
I'm gonna fall for that shit?

324
00:13:59,091 --> 00:14:02,460
I mean just, like, the best.

325
00:14:05,764 --> 00:14:06,864
What bank?

326
00:14:06,932 --> 00:14:08,332
- National Metropolitan.
- The gatekeeper?

327
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:11,535
Elaine Cohen?
[Chuckles] Exactly.

328
00:14:11,603 --> 00:14:14,438
So, you think
you can get him in?

329
00:14:14,506 --> 00:14:17,541
Well, you know
I can get him in.

330
00:14:17,609 --> 00:14:20,444
But you also know
I can keep him out.

331
00:14:20,512 --> 00:14:21,979
Okay, what's it gonna take?

332
00:14:22,047 --> 00:14:23,614
Five details
of the Pearson Hardman divide.

333
00:14:23,682 --> 00:14:25,116
- No. No.
- Three? One?

334
00:14:25,183 --> 00:14:28,452
One.

335
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,809
And I get the Albee tickets.

336
00:14:32,294 --> 00:14:33,983
We get the Albee tickets.

337
00:14:38,864 --> 00:14:40,131
Tell a soul, deal's off.

338
00:14:40,198 --> 00:14:41,798
Done.

339
00:14:45,404 --> 00:14:46,804
I love Tom.

340
00:14:46,872 --> 00:14:48,706
I love Madison 25, really.

341
00:14:48,774 --> 00:14:50,541
But I'm afraid if you look
at the fine print,

342
00:14:50,609 --> 00:14:52,209
the terms of the loan
are what they are,

343
00:14:52,277 --> 00:14:53,577
and what they aren't

344
00:14:53,645 --> 00:14:55,947
is subject to renegotiation.
Are you kidding me?

345
00:14:56,014 --> 00:14:58,015
The terms of loans
are adjusted all the time.

346
00:14:58,083 --> 00:15:00,084
And you can see
he has the assets.

347
00:15:00,152 --> 00:15:02,253
What I see?

348
00:15:02,321 --> 00:15:06,624
Is that I'm gonna have to give
you a 50% haircut on that.

349
00:15:06,692 --> 00:15:07,959
That is not liquid.

350
00:15:08,026 --> 00:15:10,127
You're never gonna
be able to sell

351
00:15:10,195 --> 00:15:12,630
a minority partnership interest,
and that...

352
00:15:12,698 --> 00:15:14,699
a monkey could tell
you could never monetize that.

353
00:15:14,766 --> 00:15:16,467
You know what else
a monkey could tell you?

354
00:15:16,535 --> 00:15:20,071
You're about to ruin a property
that will make you millions.

355
00:15:20,138 --> 00:15:22,673
I'm so sorry, gentlemen,
but this is not 2007.

356
00:15:22,741 --> 00:15:25,076
We don't play that game
anymore.

357
00:15:25,143 --> 00:15:27,345
The days of you
high-flying people

358
00:15:27,412 --> 00:15:29,113
claiming you're richer than God

359
00:15:29,181 --> 00:15:31,849
when all you're really doing is
moving assets around are over.

360
00:15:31,917 --> 00:15:33,217
Today we're gonna take
a look up your skirt

361
00:15:33,285 --> 00:15:34,752
and see what you have.

362
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:39,390
And I'm afraid
you don't have much.

363
00:15:41,793 --> 00:15:42,793
- She actually said that?
- Yes.

364
00:15:42,861 --> 00:15:43,995
Please don't make me relive it.

365
00:15:44,062 --> 00:15:46,897
As it is, I may drink a lot
on our date.

366
00:15:46,965 --> 00:15:50,301
You know,
if we're really gonna do this,

367
00:15:50,369 --> 00:15:53,938
we should probably be careful
talking about it here.

368
00:15:54,006 --> 00:15:55,740
Oh, you're right. Yeah.

369
00:15:55,807 --> 00:15:58,142
We should definitely set some
dating ground rules.

370
00:15:58,210 --> 00:15:59,643
You're not taking me home,
to my place or yours.

371
00:15:59,711 --> 00:16:04,048
Whoa, okay, I'm not talking
about ground rules for sex.

372
00:16:04,116 --> 00:16:07,284
I'm talking about ground rules
for keeping this thing quiet.

373
00:16:07,352 --> 00:16:11,122
Oh. So you think if we went
to my place or yours,

374
00:16:11,189 --> 00:16:14,025
that means sex?

375
00:16:14,092 --> 00:16:17,294
Uh, no. I mean...

376
00:16:17,362 --> 00:16:19,063
you... [Laughs]

377
00:16:19,131 --> 00:16:20,564
Uh... [Clears throat]

378
00:16:20,632 --> 00:16:23,067
What I meant was that I know you
didn't want to date anyone

379
00:16:23,135 --> 00:16:26,470
in the office, and I assume you
have a reason for that.

380
00:16:26,538 --> 00:16:27,671
Oh, okay, there is.

381
00:16:27,739 --> 00:16:30,241
There's a story.
I see it right there.

382
00:16:30,308 --> 00:16:31,375
There's no story there.
I dated someone here once.

383
00:16:31,443 --> 00:16:33,044
It didn't work out. That's it.

384
00:16:33,111 --> 00:16:35,379
No more questions.
Those are my ground rules.

385
00:16:35,447 --> 00:16:38,315
Hmm, note to self:
Touchy about dating history.

386
00:16:38,383 --> 00:16:40,251
Wow, I smell pheromones
in the air.

387
00:16:40,318 --> 00:16:44,622
Which suggests to me, Ms. Zane,
that you failed to grasp

388
00:16:44,689 --> 00:16:46,490
the importance of the task
that I assigned.

389
00:16:46,558 --> 00:16:47,725
Or unless you're done.

390
00:16:47,793 --> 00:16:48,726
- Well, I...
- No?

391
00:16:48,794 --> 00:16:50,227
You do realize you asked her

392
00:16:50,295 --> 00:16:53,230
to summarize every case
in the firm, right?

393
00:16:53,298 --> 00:16:55,332
I'm so sorry,
was I talking to you?

394
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,568
Because I already
did your job for you.

395
00:16:57,636 --> 00:17:00,037
Actually,
the bank didn't budge.

396
00:17:00,105 --> 00:17:02,573
I got you in, Michael.

397
00:17:02,641 --> 00:17:05,309
What, do you expect me
to do everything?

398
00:17:05,377 --> 00:17:08,112
Now, do I have to gather
every first year

399
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:10,548
and make them stay the night
because the paralegal

400
00:17:10,615 --> 00:17:12,550
was too busy flirting
and couldn't get it done?

401
00:17:12,617 --> 00:17:17,154
Actually, all the associates
are leaving early tonight.

402
00:17:17,222 --> 00:17:18,589
Excuse me?

403
00:17:18,657 --> 00:17:22,259
Yeah, Hardman invited everyone
to his box at the Garden.

404
00:17:22,327 --> 00:17:25,296
Springsteen.

405
00:17:25,363 --> 00:17:27,498
The boss?

406
00:17:27,566 --> 00:17:31,635
Wait, didn't he invite you?

407
00:17:34,339 --> 00:17:35,573
You think I want to spend
my evening with a bunch of

408
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,041
douche bag associates
at a concert

409
00:17:37,109 --> 00:17:40,244
given by a goddamn
octogenarian?

410
00:17:40,312 --> 00:17:42,613
Get it done.

411
00:17:54,793 --> 00:17:57,695
If I wanted to sink his
business to keep his business,

412
00:17:57,762 --> 00:17:59,597
I could have done that myself.

413
00:17:59,664 --> 00:18:02,133
Hello, Paul.
Make yourself at home.

414
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:05,035
You made him think he could
risk, not just this project,

415
00:18:05,103 --> 00:18:08,372
but everything he owns,
on a personal guarantee.

416
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:10,941
Are you crazy? What I am, Paul,

417
00:18:11,009 --> 00:18:15,045
is working my ass off
to make your client happy.

418
00:18:15,113 --> 00:18:17,615
You think I haven't
tried everything

419
00:18:17,682 --> 00:18:19,817
to keep his dream alive?

420
00:18:19,885 --> 00:18:21,819
The fact is, the bank
is going to foreclose.

421
00:18:21,887 --> 00:18:23,053
Tom needs to be protected,

422
00:18:23,121 --> 00:18:26,090
and your plan
is too big a risk.

423
00:18:26,158 --> 00:18:27,158
For you, yes, but not for Tom,

424
00:18:27,225 --> 00:18:28,792
and as I understand it,
we work for him.

425
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:29,894
[Laughing] No, no, no, no.

426
00:18:29,961 --> 00:18:32,163
I work for him.

427
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:34,231
You are working for me.

428
00:18:34,299 --> 00:18:35,966
I said he needed
to declare bankruptcy,

429
00:18:36,034 --> 00:18:40,004
but, oh, you...
you played it your way.

430
00:18:40,071 --> 00:18:44,508
Well, Jessica may give
you free rein to do that,

431
00:18:44,576 --> 00:18:46,977
but I can't imagine
Hardman will.

432
00:18:47,045 --> 00:18:51,649
You know, Paul, couples passed
on a little tip for you.

433
00:18:51,716 --> 00:18:55,085
He said your game was weak
because you were too cautious.

434
00:18:55,153 --> 00:18:58,522
I said, "It's not your game,
it's who you are."

435
00:19:05,664 --> 00:19:11,535
Harvey, I may have been
knocked down to the 46th floor,

436
00:19:11,603 --> 00:19:13,671
but bankruptcy

437
00:19:13,738 --> 00:19:19,276
is on the rise.

438
00:19:19,344 --> 00:19:24,381
My influence in this firm
is not nothing.

439
00:19:28,687 --> 00:19:31,322
You get Tom
to sign those papers.

440
00:19:31,389 --> 00:19:36,193
Is that a threat?

441
00:19:36,261 --> 00:19:38,162
I don't make threats.

442
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:42,099
I just do what I do.

443
00:19:58,390 --> 00:19:59,723
You find anything?

444
00:19:59,791 --> 00:20:01,592
Oh, I'm gonna make
Paul love you.

445
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:03,727
That's doubtful. He got wind
of our little maneuver.

446
00:20:03,795 --> 00:20:04,895
- [Laughs]
- What?

447
00:20:04,963 --> 00:20:06,897
You said "got wind."

448
00:20:06,965 --> 00:20:09,667
[Clears throat] Anyway,
I have another maneuver.

449
00:20:09,734 --> 00:20:10,901
A better one.

450
00:20:10,969 --> 00:20:12,903
Paul says we tell Tom
there's no other way.

451
00:20:12,971 --> 00:20:14,271
But there is another way.

452
00:20:14,339 --> 00:20:15,539
Oh, wait, you don't even want
to hear it?

453
00:20:15,607 --> 00:20:16,941
Of course I want to hear it.

454
00:20:17,008 --> 00:20:19,643
Since when do I take marching
orders from a bow tie?

455
00:20:19,711 --> 00:20:20,778
There are eight projects
being built

456
00:20:20,845 --> 00:20:22,746
in the two blocks
around Madison 25.

457
00:20:22,814 --> 00:20:24,481
Every one of them
started after it.

458
00:20:24,549 --> 00:20:26,717
Madison 25 is the centerpiece
of the whole development.

459
00:20:26,785 --> 00:20:28,886
If it's not finished,
they're all worthless.

460
00:20:28,954 --> 00:20:30,821
That's not the bank's problem.

461
00:20:30,889 --> 00:20:33,624
But it is, 'cause guess
what six of these buildings

462
00:20:33,692 --> 00:20:37,628
have in common.

463
00:20:37,696 --> 00:20:39,396
National's backing them all?

464
00:20:39,464 --> 00:20:42,233
Doesn't make sense for them
to foreclose and devalue

465
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:43,267
all their other projects.

466
00:20:43,335 --> 00:20:45,236
Unless they have
another agenda.

467
00:20:45,303 --> 00:20:50,007
Huh, I wonder where we could
ever find evidence of that?

468
00:20:50,075 --> 00:20:52,309
Think that helps us?

469
00:20:52,377 --> 00:20:54,178
I think we can take this
to the bank.

470
00:20:54,246 --> 00:20:55,379
Now, you see, that's funny

471
00:20:55,447 --> 00:20:56,914
because we're actually going
to a bank.

472
00:20:56,982 --> 00:21:00,951
That's good.

473
00:21:04,823 --> 00:21:07,224
Twice in one day, Mr. Specter.

474
00:21:07,292 --> 00:21:09,193
I understand how
your client must feel.

475
00:21:09,261 --> 00:21:10,828
Actually,
he's feeling fantastic.

476
00:21:10,895 --> 00:21:12,296
You know why that is?

477
00:21:12,364 --> 00:21:15,366
'Cause I told him the balloon
payment's going away.

478
00:21:15,433 --> 00:21:18,836
Okay, I'll bite.
Why is it going away?

479
00:21:18,903 --> 00:21:20,204
Because as much
as people hate lawyers,

480
00:21:20,272 --> 00:21:22,106
you know who they hate more?
Bankers.

481
00:21:22,173 --> 00:21:23,941
After all, you were the ones

482
00:21:24,009 --> 00:21:25,909
that got us into this recession
in the first place, right?

483
00:21:25,977 --> 00:21:28,912
Oh, gentlemen.
I do not need a history lesson.

484
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:30,681
Then let's talk
about the future.

485
00:21:30,749 --> 00:21:33,951
What happens to Madison 25 after
you force it into bankruptcy?

486
00:21:34,019 --> 00:21:36,520
Maybe someone steps in
and finishes it.

487
00:21:36,588 --> 00:21:38,222
Someone whose recent
merger leaves them

488
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:40,357
needing a large
downtown address?

489
00:21:40,425 --> 00:21:41,692
Oh, now that you mention it,

490
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,527
there's a little item
in your shareholder letter

491
00:21:43,595 --> 00:21:46,030
about the search for
a new corporate headquarters.

492
00:21:46,097 --> 00:21:48,532
- Yeah, I like to read.
- Well, I don't...

493
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,267
You intend to leverage
this foreclosure

494
00:21:50,335 --> 00:21:52,469
to get a prime piece
of real estate at a song.

495
00:21:52,537 --> 00:21:55,706
You see, Elaine,
we looked up your skirt.

496
00:21:55,774 --> 00:21:57,074
And the six clients
you represent

497
00:21:57,142 --> 00:21:59,209
surrounding Madison 25...
well, it turns out

498
00:21:59,277 --> 00:22:01,312
Pearson Hardman actually
reps three of them.

499
00:22:01,379 --> 00:22:03,580
And when the other three find
out about what you've done,

500
00:22:03,648 --> 00:22:05,282
which will happen right after
I leave here,

501
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:06,884
we'll rep all six.

502
00:22:06,951 --> 00:22:09,119
And when we move
their business elsewhere,

503
00:22:09,187 --> 00:22:11,955
they'll take roughly, mm...

504
00:22:12,023 --> 00:22:14,358
Mm, a shitload of money
out of your bank.

505
00:22:14,426 --> 00:22:17,328
- Shitload?
- Well, give or take.

506
00:22:22,467 --> 00:22:25,669
It's important that nobody
knows about this.

507
00:22:25,737 --> 00:22:28,072
I've never...

508
00:22:28,139 --> 00:22:31,275
done anything like this before.

509
00:22:31,343 --> 00:22:35,045
Louis, there's nothing
to be ashamed of.

510
00:22:35,113 --> 00:22:36,714
Exploring your options
is something

511
00:22:36,781 --> 00:22:39,650
everybody does these days.

512
00:22:39,718 --> 00:22:41,485
Sometimes you're
in a relationship,

513
00:22:41,553 --> 00:22:43,454
they take you for granted.

514
00:22:43,521 --> 00:22:46,657
You shouldn't be taken
for granted.

515
00:22:46,725 --> 00:22:48,926
I wouldn't take you
for granted.

516
00:22:48,993 --> 00:22:51,128
I've never even
considered this.

517
00:22:51,196 --> 00:22:53,330
Really?
People do it all the time.

518
00:22:53,398 --> 00:22:54,565
Well, not me.

519
00:22:54,632 --> 00:22:56,300
I never even let myself
think it, let alone...

520
00:22:56,368 --> 00:22:57,968
Sometimes, Louis,

521
00:22:58,036 --> 00:23:00,337
the only way to move on

522
00:23:00,405 --> 00:23:05,342
is try something new.
[Chuckles]

523
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:07,311
You're trying to seduce me.

524
00:23:07,379 --> 00:23:10,414
I'm merely saying,

525
00:23:10,482 --> 00:23:13,384
if Jessica Pearson can't see the
quality of the work that you do,

526
00:23:13,451 --> 00:23:15,853
I know half a dozen firms
who will.

527
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,755
Litt, nothing, and nobody.

528
00:23:17,822 --> 00:23:19,757
I mean, who does
she think she is?

529
00:23:19,824 --> 00:23:22,860
So... high and mighty.

530
00:23:22,927 --> 00:23:26,830
The question isn't,
"Can I get you an offer?"

531
00:23:26,898 --> 00:23:29,900
It's, "How good an offer
can I get you?"

532
00:23:33,538 --> 00:23:35,839
Uh, solicitation.

533
00:23:35,907 --> 00:23:38,876
Drugs and prostitution,
that's what you think of me?

534
00:23:38,943 --> 00:23:40,310
I've guessed everything else.

535
00:23:40,378 --> 00:23:42,012
Okay, what were
you arrested for?

536
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,147
Uh, jaywalking? Murder?

537
00:23:43,214 --> 00:23:44,782
- [Imitates buzzer]
- Spill it.

538
00:23:44,849 --> 00:23:45,983
Nope, mm-mm.

539
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:48,585
I will have to remain
a mystery to you.

540
00:23:48,653 --> 00:23:50,454
So, um...

541
00:23:50,522 --> 00:23:52,623
it was a nice date.
Great restaurant.

542
00:23:52,690 --> 00:23:56,126
- I actually picked it myself.
- Did you?

543
00:23:56,194 --> 00:23:58,862
I actually asked Donna myself.

544
00:23:58,930 --> 00:24:02,499
See, honesty,
I-I love that in a man.

545
00:24:07,172 --> 00:24:09,273
Uh.

546
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:10,841
- Um...
- [Clears throat]

547
00:24:10,909 --> 00:24:15,312
Look, I know that
we joked about not

548
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:18,315
going home together...

549
00:24:22,454 --> 00:24:26,356
I think you were right, so...

550
00:24:26,424 --> 00:24:29,026
you know, if we're
gonna do this, let's...

551
00:24:29,093 --> 00:24:31,595
let's do it right.

552
00:24:31,663 --> 00:24:35,065
Okay. [Sighs]

553
00:24:37,836 --> 00:24:41,438
Yeah. Let's do it right.

554
00:24:47,612 --> 00:24:50,013
Good night.

555
00:24:53,618 --> 00:24:58,789
[Chuckles]

556
00:24:58,857 --> 00:25:02,292
[Knock at door]

557
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:03,627
Remind me to move.

558
00:25:03,695 --> 00:25:05,496
No forwarding address.
Come to think of it,

559
00:25:05,563 --> 00:25:07,164
how did you get my address
in the first place?

560
00:25:07,232 --> 00:25:08,732
That's a nice tux.
Where were you tonight?

561
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,834
It's not where I was,
it's where I'm going.

562
00:25:10,902 --> 00:25:12,970
You're going out now?

563
00:25:13,037 --> 00:25:15,138
Oh, I know, it's already
past your bedtime.

564
00:25:15,206 --> 00:25:16,206
- [Laughs]
- Go.

565
00:25:16,274 --> 00:25:17,307
So listen,

566
00:25:17,375 --> 00:25:19,276
everything became clear
tonight, okay?

567
00:25:19,344 --> 00:25:21,979
- I was out with Rachel...
- Oh, gosh, here it comes.

568
00:25:22,046 --> 00:25:24,448
<i>Days of Our Lives.</i>
I'm serious, okay?

569
00:25:24,516 --> 00:25:27,618
I need to... I need to talk
to you about this.

570
00:25:27,685 --> 00:25:30,954
I need to tell you something.
Listen...

571
00:25:31,022 --> 00:25:32,322
I need to make sure that
you understand that I...

572
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:34,324
Look, I understand.
I think we've covered this.

573
00:25:34,392 --> 00:25:35,926
I'm not interested
in your personal life.

574
00:25:35,994 --> 00:25:39,596
I realize that
because you don't have one.

575
00:25:39,664 --> 00:25:41,999
Oh, yeah, great, you're
an international man of mystery,

576
00:25:42,066 --> 00:25:43,901
but I'm not you, all right?

577
00:25:43,968 --> 00:25:45,068
I want a personal life.

578
00:25:45,136 --> 00:25:48,438
And I don't want
to be a liar, so...

579
00:25:48,506 --> 00:25:51,708
I'm gonna tell Rachel.
Everything.

580
00:25:51,776 --> 00:25:53,710
No, you're not.

581
00:25:53,778 --> 00:25:56,680
All these lies keep coming
back to haunt me, Harvey.

582
00:25:56,748 --> 00:25:57,748
All right, I-I can't do it.

583
00:25:57,815 --> 00:25:59,216
I-I can't live my life
that way.

584
00:25:59,284 --> 00:26:00,517
I wanted to tell you,

585
00:26:00,585 --> 00:26:03,186
now you know.

586
00:26:03,254 --> 00:26:07,157
[Chuckles]
Have fun in Monte Carlo.

587
00:26:07,225 --> 00:26:08,425
What the hell
is wrong with you?

588
00:26:08,493 --> 00:26:10,327
- Harvey, please...
- After everything I did

589
00:26:10,395 --> 00:26:12,396
to keep your job, you're just
gonna start spreading it around

590
00:26:12,463 --> 00:26:14,765
that you're a fraud?
I'm not spreading it around.

591
00:26:14,832 --> 00:26:16,567
I'm telling Rachel.
She's on our side.

592
00:26:16,634 --> 00:26:17,734
No, she's not.

593
00:26:17,802 --> 00:26:19,369
Because when you
do something stupid,

594
00:26:19,437 --> 00:26:21,605
which won't take very long,
you don't know what she'll do.

595
00:26:21,673 --> 00:26:23,073
Harvey, I understand...

596
00:26:23,141 --> 00:26:24,775
No, what you fail to understand

597
00:26:24,842 --> 00:26:26,643
is our firm is under attack.

598
00:26:26,711 --> 00:26:29,112
And if this gets to Hardman,
we're done.

599
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:33,216
You, me, and Jessica.

600
00:26:33,284 --> 00:26:35,686
You want to take down
the firm, Mike?

601
00:26:35,753 --> 00:26:37,955
So you can get laid?

602
00:26:38,022 --> 00:26:39,823
Hey, maybe for you
relationships are all about

603
00:26:39,891 --> 00:26:40,991
getting laid, but not for me.

604
00:26:41,059 --> 00:26:42,459
I actually care about her.

605
00:26:42,527 --> 00:26:43,994
Weren't you just
with that other girl last week?

606
00:26:44,062 --> 00:26:45,362
Isn't that what led
to Jessica making me

607
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:47,464
fire you in the first place?
What are you saying?

608
00:26:47,532 --> 00:26:48,865
You're saying that
I can't date Rachel?

609
00:26:48,933 --> 00:26:51,201
Date Rachel!
Or don't, I don't care.

610
00:26:51,269 --> 00:26:52,869
But you're not gonna tell her.

611
00:26:52,937 --> 00:26:54,638
I can't be in a relationship
based on a lie.

612
00:26:54,706 --> 00:26:56,340
Then I guess
you have your answer.

613
00:26:56,407 --> 00:26:58,208
But being honest
with her about this?

614
00:26:58,276 --> 00:27:01,311
- That is off the table.
- There is no "about this."

615
00:27:01,379 --> 00:27:03,547
I'm either honest with her,
or I'm not.

616
00:27:03,615 --> 00:27:05,616
You tell her, and you're done.

617
00:27:11,556 --> 00:27:12,489
[Door closes]

618
00:27:21,358 --> 00:27:22,792
[Knock at door]

619
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:27,597
I really do need to move.

620
00:27:27,665 --> 00:27:30,133
I'm telling you, you better
be here to tell me that I was...

621
00:27:30,201 --> 00:27:34,370
Jessica. Come on in.

622
00:27:34,438 --> 00:27:36,539
I just got a call
from the bank.

623
00:27:36,607 --> 00:27:40,143
And you ran right over
to tell me I was awesome.

624
00:27:40,211 --> 00:27:43,046
You are decidedly not awesome.

625
00:27:43,114 --> 00:27:44,581
Oh, I beg to differ.

626
00:27:44,648 --> 00:27:47,317
I just strong-armed one of the
premier financial institutions

627
00:27:47,384 --> 00:27:50,386
in this country into allowing
our client to pursue his dreams.

628
00:27:50,454 --> 00:27:52,489
That's almost patriotic.

629
00:27:52,556 --> 00:27:54,791
Did you really miss the point
of what I asked you to do,

630
00:27:54,859 --> 00:27:57,527
or can you just
not help being a dick?

631
00:27:57,595 --> 00:27:59,028
My word this time.

632
00:27:59,096 --> 00:28:00,130
Jessica...

633
00:28:00,197 --> 00:28:03,333
Your job was
to make Paul happy,

634
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,635
not take over a case
and do it your way.

635
00:28:05,703 --> 00:28:08,471
- The client's way.
- No, it's the client's way

636
00:28:08,539 --> 00:28:10,240
because you told the client
it could be done.

637
00:28:10,307 --> 00:28:11,808
And I was right!

638
00:28:11,876 --> 00:28:14,310
And yet the experts,

639
00:28:14,378 --> 00:28:17,013
the people I pay
to know bankruptcy

640
00:28:17,081 --> 00:28:18,715
feel that Paul's client...

641
00:28:18,782 --> 00:28:21,985
oh, yes, Harvey,
Paul's client...

642
00:28:22,052 --> 00:28:23,686
stands to put more money
at risk

643
00:28:23,754 --> 00:28:25,889
when he can get out now
and move on.

644
00:28:25,956 --> 00:28:28,091
This is better.
This is a win-win.

645
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:32,328
No, it's lose-lose,
and I'm not losing this one.

646
00:28:32,396 --> 00:28:33,897
You are not to pitch this
to the client.

647
00:28:33,964 --> 00:28:36,366
- I can't keep it from him.
- You're not hearing me, Harvey.

648
00:28:36,433 --> 00:28:38,468
This isn't a discussion.

649
00:28:38,536 --> 00:28:41,304
Tell the client it didn't work.

650
00:28:41,372 --> 00:28:43,339
You tried, you failed.

651
00:28:43,407 --> 00:28:45,608
Move on.

652
00:28:45,676 --> 00:28:47,944
I'm sorry if Paul's ego
is bruised...

653
00:28:48,012 --> 00:28:51,414
This isn't about his ego.
It's about yours.

654
00:28:51,482 --> 00:28:54,184
Make it go away,

655
00:28:54,251 --> 00:28:57,153
and then walk away.

656
00:29:10,868 --> 00:29:12,902
I even told him
about the time I got arrested.

657
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:16,306
It's crazy, it's like
we can talk about anything.

658
00:29:16,373 --> 00:29:18,408
That's, um... that's great.

659
00:29:18,475 --> 00:29:19,576
I can tell you're nervous.
Don't be.

660
00:29:19,643 --> 00:29:21,044
We're gonna find
a secret meeting spot

661
00:29:21,111 --> 00:29:22,579
somewhere outside
of the office.

662
00:29:22,646 --> 00:29:26,149
No one here will have
any idea what's going on.

663
00:29:26,217 --> 00:29:28,651
Watch this.

664
00:29:28,719 --> 00:29:30,553
Good morning, Mr. Ross.

665
00:29:30,621 --> 00:29:33,223
Eh... Uh, morning.

666
00:29:33,290 --> 00:29:35,592
You still need
some work on that.

667
00:29:39,797 --> 00:29:43,466
Harvey told me.

668
00:29:43,534 --> 00:29:45,602
I know you work for him,
but he's wrong about this.

669
00:29:45,669 --> 00:29:46,769
If he really cared about me,

670
00:29:46,837 --> 00:29:48,671
he wouldn't be
handing out ultimatums.

671
00:29:48,739 --> 00:29:52,342
Ow.

672
00:29:52,409 --> 00:29:55,144
Do you like this office?

673
00:29:55,212 --> 00:29:57,580
Sure.

674
00:29:57,648 --> 00:30:00,183
Do you know how much Harvey
likes this office?

675
00:30:00,251 --> 00:30:02,986
Harvey loves this office.

676
00:30:03,053 --> 00:30:05,421
But for you, he was willing
to give it up.

677
00:30:05,489 --> 00:30:07,924
He's giving me his office?

678
00:30:07,992 --> 00:30:09,959
How do you think he kept
your job, fraud man?

679
00:30:10,027 --> 00:30:13,429
Hmm? Because Harvey said
it was a package deal.

680
00:30:13,497 --> 00:30:15,431
She fired you, she fired him.

681
00:30:15,499 --> 00:30:18,935
So before you go mouthing off
about him not caring about you,

682
00:30:19,003 --> 00:30:20,203
you think about that.
Wait a minute.

683
00:30:20,271 --> 00:30:25,842
He did that for me?

684
00:30:25,909 --> 00:30:29,445
[Sighs] I just...

685
00:30:29,513 --> 00:30:32,248
what... what am I supposed
to say to her?

686
00:30:32,316 --> 00:30:34,651
I mean, Rachel and I are both
finally in the right place.

687
00:30:34,718 --> 00:30:39,289
I told her that I wanted this,
and now...

688
00:30:39,356 --> 00:30:41,057
I'm gonna look like
such an asshole.

689
00:30:41,125 --> 00:30:44,527
Just do it gently.
Firmly, but...

690
00:30:44,595 --> 00:30:47,096
[Sighs]

691
00:30:47,164 --> 00:30:48,765
Gently.

692
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:54,337
- And... and that's gonna help?
- No, probably not.

693
00:30:54,405 --> 00:30:57,974
How are we even supposed to
work together after that, huh?

694
00:31:00,644 --> 00:31:04,314
It's possible.

695
00:31:07,551 --> 00:31:08,484
It is?

696
00:31:08,552 --> 00:31:13,222
It is.

697
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:17,927
And how do you get
from here to...

698
00:31:17,995 --> 00:31:21,331
The feelings just go away.

699
00:31:21,398 --> 00:31:23,566
Eventually.

700
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:36,346
Can I help you, Louis?

701
00:31:36,413 --> 00:31:37,647
Jessica, listen, um,

702
00:31:37,715 --> 00:31:39,248
I know you've got
a lot going on right now,

703
00:31:39,316 --> 00:31:41,084
um, but I just wanted
to tell you that I...

704
00:31:41,151 --> 00:31:44,554
Jessica. We need to talk.

705
00:31:44,621 --> 00:31:47,190
Excuse me. Hi, I was...

706
00:31:47,257 --> 00:31:48,857
Now.

707
00:31:52,629 --> 00:31:58,301
Never mind, it can wait.

708
00:31:58,369 --> 00:32:01,170
Yes, Paul?

709
00:32:01,238 --> 00:32:05,475
I want to make sure that you
and I are on the same page.

710
00:32:05,542 --> 00:32:08,211
I gave you and Harvey
an opportunity.

711
00:32:08,278 --> 00:32:10,446
I didn't give you a client.

712
00:32:10,514 --> 00:32:14,450
I am well aware
of your position, Paul.

713
00:32:14,518 --> 00:32:17,320
If you'll excuse me? Mm.

714
00:32:23,494 --> 00:32:25,094
[Sighs]

715
00:32:28,665 --> 00:32:29,899
[Door opens]

716
00:32:29,967 --> 00:32:31,067
What?

717
00:32:31,135 --> 00:32:34,937
- Sorry, um...
- Oh, put it right here.

718
00:32:35,005 --> 00:32:40,309
And get out.

719
00:32:49,686 --> 00:32:54,891
Daniel Hardman? [Chuckles]

720
00:33:05,769 --> 00:33:06,903
The XJS 5000 dictaphone?

721
00:33:06,970 --> 00:33:12,208
How the hell did he know?

722
00:33:12,276 --> 00:33:16,212
[Laughs]

723
00:33:35,432 --> 00:33:39,235
I heard the bank came through.

724
00:33:39,303 --> 00:33:43,606
Jessica told me
to tank the deal.

725
00:33:43,674 --> 00:33:45,942
Sucks, doesn't it?

726
00:33:46,009 --> 00:33:49,412
Being told what to do.

727
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:52,482
What not to do.

728
00:33:52,549 --> 00:33:57,720
What are you gonna do
about what we talked about?

729
00:33:57,788 --> 00:34:00,556
I don't know.

730
00:34:00,624 --> 00:34:02,525
I think you do know.

731
00:34:02,593 --> 00:34:04,060
I think you know what's right,

732
00:34:04,127 --> 00:34:07,930
whether I had
to tell you or not.

733
00:34:15,739 --> 00:34:18,007
So, Tom.

734
00:34:18,075 --> 00:34:23,279
Harvey has something
to tell you.

735
00:34:23,347 --> 00:34:27,183
Did you find me my miracle?

736
00:34:27,251 --> 00:34:30,186
The bank agreed to alter
the terms of the loan.

737
00:34:30,254 --> 00:34:31,320
No balloon payment.

738
00:34:31,388 --> 00:34:32,622
Madison 25 is safe.
No bankruptcy.

739
00:34:32,689 --> 00:34:35,491
Oh, oh, man. Thank you.

740
00:34:35,559 --> 00:34:38,628
Thank you so much.

741
00:34:38,695 --> 00:34:39,962
Well, Paul. Mm.

742
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:42,131
Looks like you found me
the right quarterback

743
00:34:42,199 --> 00:34:43,933
for the fourth quarter.
[Laughs]

744
00:34:44,001 --> 00:34:46,135
I won't forget this.

745
00:34:46,203 --> 00:34:50,439
No, nor will I.

746
00:35:09,195 --> 00:35:12,263
I have been irritated by you,
exasperated with you,

747
00:35:12,331 --> 00:35:14,799
and angry at you,

748
00:35:14,867 --> 00:35:17,702
but I never thought
I'd feel betrayed by you.

749
00:35:17,770 --> 00:35:19,003
I put together a good deal.

750
00:35:19,071 --> 00:35:20,505
- It was a safe deal...
- I don't care.

751
00:35:20,573 --> 00:35:23,408
You just ensured that a voting
partner would never back me.

752
00:35:23,476 --> 00:35:26,311
If his mother were dying
of cancer and I saved her,

753
00:35:26,378 --> 00:35:27,912
I still wouldn't get his vote.

754
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:29,113
I know you're angry,

755
00:35:29,181 --> 00:35:31,015
but I took the restructured deal
to real estate.

756
00:35:31,083 --> 00:35:32,283
That puts them in your pocket.

757
00:35:32,351 --> 00:35:33,718
Real estate has always been
in my pocket.

758
00:35:33,786 --> 00:35:35,353
It's only you they hated.

759
00:35:35,421 --> 00:35:36,754
And I'm beginning
to understand why.

760
00:35:36,822 --> 00:35:39,724
- This isn't me against you.
- Hardman is back.

761
00:35:39,792 --> 00:35:42,260
You were the one person
I could trust.

762
00:35:42,328 --> 00:35:43,261
- Jessica...
- I've always known

763
00:35:43,329 --> 00:35:44,462
what you are, Harvey,

764
00:35:44,530 --> 00:35:47,465
and I thought that was
my greatest asset.

765
00:35:47,533 --> 00:35:50,869
Now I'm wondering if you're
not my biggest liability.

766
00:35:50,936 --> 00:35:53,037
This isn't about bankruptcy.

767
00:35:53,105 --> 00:35:54,506
You're still pissed off
about Mike Ross.

768
00:35:54,573 --> 00:35:57,108
- Damn right I am.
- I offered to walk away.

769
00:35:57,176 --> 00:35:59,277
That offer was bullshit,
and you know it.

770
00:35:59,345 --> 00:36:01,479
You hired that kid
to amuse yourself,

771
00:36:01,547 --> 00:36:03,047
and now I'm vulnerable.

772
00:36:03,115 --> 00:36:05,416
And after everything
that's happened,

773
00:36:05,484 --> 00:36:10,522
you still couldn't put me
ahead of you.

774
00:36:10,589 --> 00:36:12,590
The client asked me
to save his dream.

775
00:36:12,658 --> 00:36:14,058
I did.

776
00:36:14,126 --> 00:36:16,060
You're actually starting
to believe your own bullshit.

777
00:36:16,128 --> 00:36:18,696
- Jessica, come on.
- Just go, Harvey.

778
00:36:18,764 --> 00:36:23,067
I will get past this.
I will move on.

779
00:36:23,135 --> 00:36:26,804
And I will accept that
at the end of the day,

780
00:36:26,872 --> 00:36:30,408
that I am alone in this.

781
00:36:54,433 --> 00:36:56,901
- Hey.
- Hey.

782
00:36:56,969 --> 00:36:58,002
Four blocks from the office,

783
00:36:58,070 --> 00:36:59,904
I sort of love
this clandestine thing.

784
00:36:59,972 --> 00:37:01,239
Kind of sexy, right? [Laughs]

785
00:37:01,307 --> 00:37:03,441
[Laughs] Oh, thank you.

786
00:37:03,509 --> 00:37:05,209
Look, I was thinking about
what you said last night,

787
00:37:05,277 --> 00:37:07,812
and you're right,
I have been so scared about

788
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:11,482
taking the LSATs, I know I have.
Rachel, I, uh...

789
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:14,252
there's something
I need to tell you.

790
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:17,989
We can't do this anymore.

791
00:37:18,057 --> 00:37:19,424
Okay.

792
00:37:19,491 --> 00:37:20,692
It's not that I don't want to...

793
00:37:20,759 --> 00:37:22,026
Wait, where's this coming from?

794
00:37:22,094 --> 00:37:24,195
Because last night you... eh...
this was all your idea.

795
00:37:24,263 --> 00:37:25,430
- I know.
- So?

796
00:37:25,497 --> 00:37:28,600
Collin McCarthy?

797
00:37:28,667 --> 00:37:30,668
- What about Collin McCarthy?
- You dated him.

798
00:37:30,736 --> 00:37:32,503
- Yeah, I know.
- He was a first-year.

799
00:37:32,571 --> 00:37:34,305
You broke up with him,
and his work went off a cliff,

800
00:37:34,373 --> 00:37:35,807
and then he was fired
two months later.

801
00:37:35,874 --> 00:37:37,075
That's why you don't want
to date someone

802
00:37:37,142 --> 00:37:38,476
from the office, right?
This is ridiculous.

803
00:37:38,544 --> 00:37:39,877
He has nothing to do
with you and me.

804
00:37:39,945 --> 00:37:41,412
But he does.

805
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:44,916
I know that you and I both
want this, okay, but...

806
00:37:44,984 --> 00:37:48,853
chances are,
I'm gonna screw it up.

807
00:37:48,921 --> 00:37:50,154
I love my job,

808
00:37:50,222 --> 00:37:53,224
and I love...
I love working with you.

809
00:37:53,292 --> 00:37:55,159
And I'm afraid, okay?
I'm afraid that...

810
00:37:55,227 --> 00:37:58,930
that this will ruin that.

811
00:37:58,998 --> 00:38:00,264
So...

812
00:38:00,332 --> 00:38:06,270
Wow, that was a lot
of words, Mike.

813
00:38:06,338 --> 00:38:08,406
Why don't you just say it?

814
00:38:08,474 --> 00:38:10,041
You know what, actually,
don't say it.

815
00:38:10,109 --> 00:38:12,210
I can say it for you
because it doesn't take me days

816
00:38:12,277 --> 00:38:13,277
to hear your message.

817
00:38:13,345 --> 00:38:14,846
I hear your message
loud and clear.

818
00:38:14,913 --> 00:38:20,151
I'm just not good enough
for you.

819
00:38:32,898 --> 00:38:37,669
Have Norma send up
a bouquet of flowers,

820
00:38:37,736 --> 00:38:42,740
and make sure that they
repolish the cherrywood.

821
00:38:42,808 --> 00:38:46,344
It's walnut.

822
00:38:46,412 --> 00:38:51,549
I just wanted to make sure
that the place was ready.

823
00:38:51,617 --> 00:38:53,518
I had them redo the walls.

824
00:38:53,585 --> 00:38:57,522
This is taupe. Mm.

825
00:38:57,589 --> 00:38:59,657
I want it to be perfect

826
00:38:59,725 --> 00:39:03,361
for when Daniel gets back.

827
00:39:03,429 --> 00:39:05,596
You wanted something
this morning.

828
00:39:05,664 --> 00:39:07,665
I'm sorry, I was rushed.

829
00:39:07,733 --> 00:39:10,368
I'm not now.

830
00:39:10,436 --> 00:39:14,072
Do you still need me?

831
00:39:14,139 --> 00:39:16,541
No.

832
00:39:43,035 --> 00:39:45,236
Checking up on me?

833
00:39:45,304 --> 00:39:46,904
Checking in on you.

834
00:39:46,972 --> 00:39:48,773
Well, don't worry, Harvey.

835
00:39:48,841 --> 00:39:51,542
You were right, as always.

836
00:39:51,610 --> 00:39:54,011
I don't like having
to tell you to do something

837
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:55,513
that you don't want to do.

838
00:39:55,581 --> 00:39:58,182
Why is it that I have to do
everything that you tell me to,

839
00:39:58,250 --> 00:40:02,887
but you can ignore whatever
Jessica tells you to do?

840
00:40:02,955 --> 00:40:05,289
You have plenty of time
to find the right girl, Mike.

841
00:40:05,357 --> 00:40:08,159
[Chuckles] Well, thank you.

842
00:40:08,227 --> 00:40:10,495
Guess I should get my book,
take some notes.

843
00:40:10,562 --> 00:40:12,697
Harvey Specter's dating tips.

844
00:40:12,765 --> 00:40:16,534
'Cause I'm sure you told
yourself that at 25 and 30

845
00:40:16,602 --> 00:40:19,070
and 35, and I'm sure you'll be
telling yourself that

846
00:40:19,138 --> 00:40:23,741
when you're 50.

847
00:40:23,809 --> 00:40:28,980
You know I was right.

848
00:40:29,047 --> 00:40:33,518
Doesn't make it any better.

849
00:41:10,556 --> 00:41:16,494
[Rattling]

850
00:41:25,971 --> 00:41:27,972
You're not alone in this.

851
00:41:32,644 --> 00:41:35,880
Put it over there.
