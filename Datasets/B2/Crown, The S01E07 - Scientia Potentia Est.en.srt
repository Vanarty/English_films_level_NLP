1
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,520
Your Majesty.

2
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:54,360
So, it is
always the Sovereign who begins the meal.

3
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:04,040
It is absolutely forbidden to begin
before he, or she, takes their first bite.

4
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,360
<i>Oui, Mademoiselle.</i>

5
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:10,040
During
the meal, when it is the first course,

6
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:13,480
you must only speak to the person
seated on your right until the end.

7
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:16,520
Time for the Vice-Provost,
Lilibet.

8
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:49,840
Your Royal Highness. Come on.

9
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:54,680
"There are two elements
of the Constitution:"

10
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:58,880
wrote Walter Bagehot in 1867.

11
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:05,400
"The efficient and the dignified."

12
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,880
Which is the monarch?

13
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,720
Your Royal Highness?

14
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,400
-The dignified?
-Very good.

15
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:25,440
The efficient has the power
to make and execute policy

16
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,360
and is answerable to the electorate.

17
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,840
What touches all
should be approved by all.

18
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:38,200
The dignified gives significance
and legitimacy to the efficient

19
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:41,200
and is answerable only...?

20
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,680
-To God.
-Precisely.

21
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:51,720
Two institutions, Crown and government,
dignified and the efficient,

22
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:55,160
only work when they support each other.

23
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,960
When they trust one another.

24
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,480
You can underline that.

25
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:10,280
-Do you teach this to your other pupils?
-No, just you.

26
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,880
This is what I teach them.

27
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,480
These are exam papers.

28
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:26,680
-Shouldn't I know all of this, too?
-No, Ma'am.

29
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,600
All very undignified.

30
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:31,520
I see Mr. Einstein
has changed his mind again?

31
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,240
-Oh?
-The scientist.

32
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,840
No, I know who he is. What exactly
has he changed his mind about?

33
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,240
That's rather less clear to me,

34
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,600
but everyone's making
a tremendous fuss about it.

35
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:59,160
At the time of my education,
I asked the Vice-Provost

36
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:05,120
if we shouldn't spend a bit of time
on Literature, Philosophy, Science.

37
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:09,560
He felt I had enough on my plate
as it was.

38
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:13,800
But don't you think
I should have learned about it?

39
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:14,880
Why?

40
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:19,880
Well, doesn't one have a duty
to know certain things?

41
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:24,480
You have a great many other virtues.
You can't be expected to know everything.

42
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,920
Well, no, that's the point, Mummy.
I know almost nothing.

43
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,600
You know when to keep your mouth shut.
That's more important than anything.

44
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,520
And that would've been fine
if I'd gone on to live a normal life.

45
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:43,880
But now I spend so much time
with politicians and statesmen.

46
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:47,440
You know, I live in dread
of being left alone with them.

47
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,000
Your dear papa was just the same.

48
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:56,920
Be nice to think that one could,
if not hold one's own,

49
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
then at least
not have to steer the conversation

50
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:01,400
away to dogs and horses every time.

51
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,560
The Prime Minister's on his way, Ma'am.

52
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:08,480
Well, one good thing about this one is
you never have to open your mouth at all.

53
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,800
That's true.

54
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:13,480
Just smile politely
while he drones on and on.

55
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:16,600
Your Majesty may or may not be aware,
but this is my retirement year.

56
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,520
Is it really? How long has it been?

57
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,880
33 years, Ma'am,
serving four sovereigns.

58
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,800
One can hardly imagine the place
without you.

59
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,120
It's kind of you to say so, Ma'am, but
we're well prepared for the transition.

60
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,240
A deputy's long been groomed
and made ready.

61
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,840
-Two deputies, right?
-Yes, Ma'am.

62
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:32,440
-A senior and a junior.
-An heir and a spare.

63
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,320
Quite.

64
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:37,320
Well, before we discuss any of that,

65
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:40,080
I'd like you to know how grateful
we all are to you.

66
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,320
-For your years of service.
-Thank you, Ma'am.

67
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,560
My father was quite dependent on you.
You know that.

68
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:49,920
And in our short time together,
I could see how I could be, too.

69
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,040
But you deserve to put your feet up.

70
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:54,920
And I think I could work quite well
with Martin Charteris.

71
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,480
-Martin Charteris?
-Yes.

72
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,040
I assume you'll give that your blessing.

73
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:06,680
Martin is the junior deputy
private secretary, Ma'am, the spare.

74
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:10,920
Michael Adeane is the senior.
The rightful heir.

75
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:14,280
Yes, but Martin and I
have worked together before.

76
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:17,320
-I'm aware of that.
-I'm sure Michael would understand

77
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:21,600
that I had a pre-existing relationship
with Martin and not take it personally.

78
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,440
Martin is a younger man.
It's the more natural fit.

79
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,520
If that is Your Majesty's wish.

80
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,720
Prime Minister,
I'm so sorry to have kept you waiting.

81
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,600
Not at all.

82
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,360
-Oh, but I see you've found company.
-Yes.

83
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:00,440
Honey, Sugar, Pippin, say goodbye.
Thank you, Tommy.

84
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,760
Shall we make a start?

85
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:12,560
One item overshadows every other
on the agenda this week, Ma'am.

86
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,080
The Soviets and their H-bomb.

87
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,440
We now have confirmation
that they have been testing

88
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,720
in the Kazakh Desert.

89
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:23,480
It is vital that we act swiftly
to secure peace

90
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:27,360
and vital that we British
spearhead the effort.

91
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,720
I have always been the person

92
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,640
everyone wants in a room with the Russians

93
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:36,400
because Stalin would only talk to me.

94
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,800
With him gone, there is a great danger

95
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:43,120
that Eisenhower will take it upon himself
to run the show.

96
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,160
And that would be bad?

97
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,840
Oh, a disaster, Ma'am.
For all the obvious reasons.

98
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,160
Of course.

99
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,440
Remind me. Of the obvious reasons.

100
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,800
Russia...

101
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:11,960
is a great old empire
which demands and deserves respect.

102
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:17,360
Americans like to wave the big stick
and speak with a loud voice.

103
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:22,480
In the matter of world governance,
they are not yet ready.

104
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,520
They need

105
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:29,320
an experienced and elder power

106
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,840
to guide them, school them.

107
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,400
Yes, we could all do with some school.

108
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:37,800
To that end, I've asked
the Foreign Secretary to go to Washington

109
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:42,320
to lay plans for a summit meeting
between myself and Eisenhower,

110
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:45,000
to start discussing a unified approach

111
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,160
for how to bring the Russians
back into the family.

112
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,880
-Do you think he's up to it?
-Eisenhower?

113
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,440
No, the Foreign Secretary.

114
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:57,440
Anthony is the finest Foreign Secretary
this country has had for generations.

115
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,240
Yes, but I've heard
he's also a very sick man.

116
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:06,720
I would hate to think
that the country wasn't in safe hands,

117
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,360
being led by healthy men.

118
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:13,320
We are both fine, Ma'am. I assure you.

119
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,280
Early indications are
that the bomb they tested

120
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:21,280
was a fission and fusion-fueled
Sloika design,

121
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,440
based on lithium-six deuteride
and uranium-two-three-five

122
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:27,600
with a yield of 400 kilotons.

123
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:31,680
Khrushchev claims
the weapon is ready for immediate use,

124
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,960
capable of deployment
from a bomber aircraft.

125
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:36,640
He was bragging about it
to the Presidium last week.

126
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,960
Do we believe that?

127
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:42,400
Latest CIA intelligence seems to
support it, with the Soviets known to be

128
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,040
ramping up their production
of long-range bomber aircraft...

129
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,840
Are you all right, sir?

130
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:53,920
My bag, please. Give me my bag.

131
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,280
You can do this.

132
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,960
Sir, this really should be done
by a doctor.

133
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:18,880
Just find a vein. Come on!

134
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:38,800
Now, we can say with confidence
that Joe Four's total yield,

135
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:42,240
why, was in the range
of four to 500 kilotons.

136
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,960
Now, intelligence sources indicate
the Soviets used the layered design...

137
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:51,520
similar to our own
"Ivy Mike" detonation in '52,

138
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,840
which is consistent with the blast radius.

139
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:57,080
The British Foreign Secretary.

140
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:12,080
That gentleman
is not just a sleeping man,

141
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,120
it's a sad metaphor.

142
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,800
The second most powerful man

143
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:19,160
in what was once
the most powerful country on Earth.

144
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,920
What's that on his arm?

145
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,440
Looks like blood, sir.

146
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,240
Good God.

147
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,800
Colonel Charteris, Your Majesty.

148
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,240
-You asked to see me?
-I did. Do sit down.

149
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:54,760
Now, as I'm sure you're aware,

150
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:59,400
Tommy Lascelles will be leaving us shortly
to begin his well-deserved retirement.

151
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,720
And his departure
will leave something of a gap.

152
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,200
Yes.

153
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:12,240
And I was wondering whether you
might be interested in filling that gap?

154
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,480
-As what, Ma'am?
-My Private Secretary.

155
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,280
-I'd be delighted, but...
-But what?

156
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,720
What about Michael Adeane?

157
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,160
-What about him?
-He is the natural successor.

158
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,280
I was hoping it might be possible for me
to make my own decision just once.

159
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:35,000
There are two Private Secretaries
to choose from.

160
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,280
And I happen to prefer the Junior.

161
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,760
So, shall we say that's that?

162
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:47,800
Yes. I suppose we shall.

163
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:50,000
-Good.
-Thank you.

164
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,920
Is there anything I can do?
In the meantime.

165
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
No, no, no. Thank you, Martin.

166
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:01,960
Actually, Martin...

167
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,000
A tutor.

168
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:08,720
-Ma'am?
-I'd like to engage one.

169
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,480
-Any particular field?
-General education.

170
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:14,760
-I'll come up with some names.
-Thank you.

171
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:19,640
Oh, and, Martin, preferably one,
you know, not too stuffy. Sense of humor.

172
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:21,800
Understood.

173
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:32,360
I'm no stranger to pain, Winston,
but this has become intolerable.

174
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:35,760
<i>I must have corrective surgery.</i>

175
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:40,200
And this "corrective surgery,"
must it really be Boston?

176
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:43,400
<i>That's where the best man is.</i>
<i>The only man.</i>

177
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:48,160
They're better equipped to deal
with gall bladder problems in America.

178
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,240
<i>Due to the high fat diets they have here.</i>

179
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,920
Leaving me without you
for the summit with Ike.

180
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,240
-Can't you delay it?
<i>-No, I can't.</i>

181
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,600
Besides, you have already stated

182
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:03,960
your ability to run the ship without me
for some time.

183
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:08,360
In jest, my dear boy, when you become
mutinous and presumptuous.

184
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,520
You know how much I depend on you.

185
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,760
<i>-I do.</i>
-Well?

186
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,520
<i>But I'd still like to hear you</i>
<i>say it again.</i>

187
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:23,760
-What?
-I'd like you to say it again so that...

188
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:29,360
<i>all the people listening in can hear.</i>
<i>You were saying.</i>

189
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,040
That...

190
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,200
I depend on you, Anthony.

191
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,320
<i> What for?</i>

192
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:43,080
<i> For your judgement.</i>

193
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:48,640
<i> - What else?</i>
<i>-  Your integrity. And loyalty.</i>

194
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,160
Louder, please.

195
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,520
Yes, all right!
Yes, I need you there, Anthony!

196
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,880
I think we're all agreed, I need you!

197
00:16:55,960 --> 00:17:01,960
<i>And I need the surgery, Winston.</i>
<i>It's my life that's at stake now.</i>

198
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,400
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

199
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,920
Prime Minister. Prime Minister?

200
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:04,480
- What's that?
- Here, Charles. That one.

201
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,560
Look. Look at this.
Do you like my picture?

202
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:15,000
It's a rocket.
One day it'll take us into space.

203
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,040
Let's move on.

204
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,800
- Professor Hogg, Your Majesty.
- Who?

205
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:24,800
Colonel Charteris said
you were expecting him.

206
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,240
Oh, yes.

207
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,120
Where's Mercury?

208
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:33,680
High up in the sky, Charles.
It's where all the other planets are.

209
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,640
-Your Majesty.
-Professor Hogg.

210
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,480
During the course of my new daily life,

211
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:45,280
I have to spend a great deal of time
alone with statesmen.

212
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,960
Men, like yourself,
of exceptional intellect,

213
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,960
who've risen to the very top
of their profession

214
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,760
by virtue of their intelligence
and their ability.

215
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,880
There are frequently times

216
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,440
when I am discussing agendas of the day

217
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:09,240
with these people that I find myself...

218
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,120
on the back foot.

219
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:20,560
At something of a disadvantage.
Because I...

220
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,760
I can't keep up.

221
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,240
Or I don't know
what lies behind something.

222
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:29,520
And that's no way to live.

223
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:34,120
To be uninformed
and entirely at someone else's mercy.

224
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:38,720
Quite. Which is why I was hoping that you
might help me hold my own, some more,

225
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:43,200
feel at less of a disadvantage, fill in...

226
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,480
Fill in some of the gaps.

227
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:51,600
Perhaps Her Majesty would give me
an idea of roughly how far she got?

228
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:54,600
-When?
-With her education.

229
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:59,480
-In what sense?
-Which exams she might have taken

230
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:04,760
and passed, that I might better know
at what level to pitch our tutorials.

231
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:11,000
The Higher School Certificate,
for example.

232
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:18,720
All right. The School Certificate, then.

233
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,880
No.

234
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:28,800
Any privately-tutored equivalents thereof,
perhaps?

235
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:32,800
I see.

236
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,600
Her Majesty the Queen, Ma'am.

237
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,600
This is a surprise.

238
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,520
To what do I owe the pleasure?

239
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:57,640
I came because I wanted to ask you
a question about my education.

240
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,840
What about it?

241
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:05,040
-The fact that I didn't receive one.
-You did.

242
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:09,360
Sewing, needlework
and saying poems with Crawfie.

243
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,880
That is not an education.

244
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:16,720
Darling, you also spent years one-on-one
with the Vice-Provost of Eton College.

245
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,320
Being drilled in the Constitution.

246
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,640
Which is far more
than your sister ever got.

247
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:26,080
Mummy! I'm talking about
a normal education. In normal subjects.

248
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:29,720
You received an entirely appropriate
education for a woman of your background.

249
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:32,480
Which has entirely failed to prepare me
for the life I lead now.

250
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:36,960
We taught you how to be a lady,
a princess. What do you want? A degree?

251
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:40,880
No one wants a bluestocking
or a college lecturer as sovereign.

252
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,400
They want a Queen.

253
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,000
Yes, a queen
who is hopelessly ill-equipped

254
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:47,600
to deal with the people
that she has to meet.

255
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,840
What has this to do with me?

256
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:59,600
How could you have let me down like this?

257
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:03,280
Is this a criticism of my motherhood?

258
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:10,680
I would've thought you'd think twice
before throwing stones on that score.

259
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,680
What's that supposed to mean?

260
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,560
I hardly see you blazing a trail
in that department.

261
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:18,720
That's not fair.

262
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,760
Besides,
I thought we were past the age now

263
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:23,480
where we take cheap shots at our parents.

264
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:26,080
I educated you
as your father and I saw fit.

265
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,200
Why didn't we push harder?

266
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:31,720
No one advised that we should.
That includes the Vice-Provost.

267
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:38,880
Oh, don't force something
that doesn't come naturally, dear.

268
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,560
That's what I've learned.

269
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:47,800
We all have to accept
our limitations in life.

270
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:12,720
That's it, there.
The grace and favor flat,

271
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,760
belonging to
the Queen's Private Secretary.

272
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:17,960
-Our new home.
-How much of the ground floor is it?

273
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:22,640
All of it. Including the rooms
stretching to the back.

274
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,400
The girls will be happy here.

275
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,800
Now, we must go.

276
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,160
-I don't want anyone to see us.
-Why?

277
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,800
Well, it's just indiscreet.

278
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,560
-And I haven't got the job yet.
-What about that tree?

279
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,200
It's blocking all the light.

280
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,560
Well, I daresay one could ask
to have it trimmed back.

281
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,320
Will you ask?

282
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:49,760
I don't see the rush, but...
yes, I can ask. Discreetly.

283
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,400
<i>Good God.</i>

284
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:02,320
A stroke, Bobbety, that's all,
a minor stroke.

285
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,840
But I'm on the mend, bouncing back.

286
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,840
Well, you don't look very bouncy to me.

287
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,480
-Who knows?
-No one.

288
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:11,160
And no one can know. Especially the Queen.

289
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,080
What?

290
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:17,360
I have promised her that the country
will always have a healthy man in charge.

291
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:21,000
You know me, Bobbety,
I am a man of my word.

292
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,440
But you can't just hide it from her.

293
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:27,560
I mean, you're head of the government
which runs the country in her name.

294
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,400
Don't you think she'll smell a rat

295
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,440
when no one turns up
at her private audience?

296
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:36,160
The Palace has been told
that I have a cold.

297
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,400
A cold?

298
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:43,520
Jock, you have my permission
to extend that to the flu.

299
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,560
-Sir.
-But no more.

300
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:48,880
And what about the meeting with Eisenhower
in Washington?

301
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:52,880
Alas, as I have been
refused permission to fly,

302
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,080
I am left with no option.

303
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:58,040
-To postpone it?
-Are you mad?

304
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:02,760
The Russian situation could not be
more delicately poised,

305
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:06,080
nor more needing of my influence.

306
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,120
No.

307
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,400
We have to get Eisenhower here.

308
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:16,840
<i>You see, Tommy, there's no other</i>
<i>way. Well, how about the 12th of July?</i>

309
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:20,640
-I doubt it.
<i>-All right, the 13th?</i>

310
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,560
-I doubt that as well.
<i>-The 14th then.</i>

311
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:26,360
I can put it to her, Bobbety,
but I wouldn't hold your breath.

312
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:28,920
<i>Well, I'll leave it to</i>
<i>your powers of persuasion.</i>

313
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,560
Goodbye.

314
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,480
Sorry to disturb you, Ma'am,

315
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:06,960
but I just had
Lord Salisbury on the phone

316
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:10,040
with an unusual request.

317
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:13,000
President Eisenhower
is due to meet the Prime Minister

318
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:18,120
in Washington for a summit next week,
but Mr. Churchill's developed a cold,

319
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,920
a nasty cold and Lord Moran, his doctor,
has forbidden him to fly.

320
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,680
Now, the feeling is the meeting
is of the utmost importance

321
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:27,640
so Downing Street was wondering
whether we might be able to help.

322
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:30,520
-Help how?
-By inviting the President here.

323
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,600
-Where?
-Here, Ma'am, to Buckingham Palace,

324
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,520
to a state banquet next week.

325
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:42,240
The feeling is that, by that time, Winston
should have made a sufficient recovery.

326
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,840
Well, I was planning
on going to Sandringham.

327
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:50,480
I'm afraid it would mean
postponing that by a few days.

328
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:00,400
We can extend an invitation
through our ambassador in Washington.

329
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,560
-Is that a green light, Ma'am?
-Yes.

330
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:06,160
Then, if you'll excuse me,
I better get cracking.

331
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,960
Do you have a moment, Tommy?
I need to speak to you urgently.

332
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:14,560
I don't, I'm afraid,
I have a state banquet to arrange,

333
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,360
so if it can possibly wait until later...

334
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:19,120
I think when you hear it,
you'll share my sense of alarm.

335
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,880
It seems that Martin Charteris

336
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:24,840
is to replace you as Her Majesty's
Private Secretary, not me.

337
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,440
What? Says who?

338
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:29,040
Says Margaret Colville,
Jock Colville's wife,

339
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:32,200
who plays bridge with Alice Jameson,
lady-in-waiting,

340
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:36,000
who as you may know,
plays tennis with Mary Charteris.

341
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,760
Why on earth would I know that?

342
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,280
Anyway, so confident
are they of the appointment,

343
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:43,200
-that Mary has even gone so...
-Don't tell me.

344
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:45,040
So far to speak
to the Palace Head Gardener

345
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,160
about trimming the tree
outside my window.

346
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,920
Yes.

347
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,360
Ask Martin to come and see me, would you?

348
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:56,680
That is, if he and his lady wife are not
too busy measuring carpets and curtains

349
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:57,880
for what is still my home.

350
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:07,280
-Right, it's green light. Jump to it.
-Sir.

351
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,200
-You asked to see me, Tommy.
-I did. Do sit down.

352
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:22,960
Martin, you've worked for the Palace now,
for what, three years?

353
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:25,640
I'd have thought that long enough
for you to know the ropes.

354
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:29,800
Understand the rules,
the way things are done.

355
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,000
I think I do.

356
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,240
Manifestly not.

357
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,360
Professor Hogg, Your Majesty.

358
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:04,800
-Your Majesty.
-Professor.

359
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:14,080
I know you were going to prepare
some tutorials of a more general nature,

360
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:18,880
but it seems I'm going to need
some more specific knowledge first.

361
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:23,560
-On which subject?
-President Eisenhower.

362
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:26,800
He'll be coming here in a matter of days
and I'll be expected...

363
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:31,120
to sit next to him
and make conversation with him.

364
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,720
So I need to know all about him
and what interests him.

365
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:37,560
The military industrial complex, Ma'am.

366
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:39,880
What?

367
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:44,200
And its threat to democratic government.
It's what most concerns him.

368
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:50,560
-Something lighter, perhaps?
-Golf?

369
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:55,040
-Anything else?
-Oil painting.

370
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:59,560
-I'm told he paints landscapes.
-Oh, don't they all?

371
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:07,600
Would Your Majesty give me 24 hours
to do some research and come back to you?

372
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:08,600
Yes. Of course.

373
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:17,160
He was baptized, wasn't he?
Just six months ago.

374
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,600
Yes, I think I read about that.
A Presbyterian.

375
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:27,680
-Did they dunk him, do you think?
-Dunk?

376
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:34,720
-A full immersion. In some river.
-If I were a gambling man, I'd say yes.

377
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:36,800
Are you?

378
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:41,520
Occasionally.
The Derby, Ma'am, and the Grand National.

379
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,120
Oh, how did you get on this year?

380
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:48,960
At the National, rather well.
I had "Early Mist" on an each-way bet.

381
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:53,440
Oh, well done, you. You won by 20 lengths.
I share your admiration for Mr. O'Brien,

382
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:56,720
and everything he's doing
at Ballydoyle Stables.

383
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:59,040
-Who?
-The trainer.

384
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:04,560
-That's not why you backed him?
-No. I just liked the name.

385
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,680
I see.

386
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:12,600
-Back in 24 hours.
-Thank you.

387
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:29,000
<i> "I'm so sorry</i>
<i>to hear that in these past days</i>

388
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:31,120
you've not been
in your usual good health."

389
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,160
Isn't that nice?

390
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:36,600
"And that your tireless exertions
on behalf of this country

391
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:40,360
have resulted
in this temporary inconvenience."

392
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,640
"Temporary inconvenience."

393
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:47,040
How much does she know exactly?

394
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,760
Because, from the tone of this...

395
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,400
Winston.

396
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,880
-She thinks it's a cold.
-A cold?

397
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:00,640
Yes, a cold. If she knew the truth,
she would bid me stand down.

398
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,680
-Good.
-A replacement would have to be found.

399
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:05,680
The wrong replacement,
because the right man...

400
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:09,040
-Anthony.
-...is himself incapacitated.

401
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:12,520
Too much knowledge
can be a dangerous thing.

402
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,320
Do you mean to tell me that,
at the moment,

403
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:17,880
this country's without a fit leader
or a deputy leader?

404
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,560
Shh. Not so loud.

405
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,400
-But...
-Come.

406
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:26,080
Good news, sir.
It's a yes from Eisenhower.

407
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:29,320
You were right,
an invitation from the Palace

408
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,760
has proved impossible
for the Americans to refuse.

409
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:34,360
They've changed his schedule
and they're going to make it work.

410
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:37,280
-But that's wonderful news!
-Don't get out bed, Winston!

411
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:39,840
-It is wonderful!
-Don't get out bed, darling.

412
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,240
Don't get out of bed.

413
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:43,800
If Ike comes here,
I can be leader again.

414
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,800
-Winston.
-That's what really matters.

415
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:48,720
Getting me and Ike in the same room,
so that he and I can...

416
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:49,920
Do go back to bed.

417
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,800
...get on with building a real
and lasting peace with the Russians!

418
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:56,720
Look, why don't you admit the truth,
that you have been fighting for your life

419
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,000
and tell the Queen?

420
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,480
Winston?

421
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:41,280
-How serious is it this time?
-It's impossible to know.

422
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:47,120
I fear we do now have to put off
the Americans.

423
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:48,240
Yes, of course.

424
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:53,920
-And tell the Queen.
-No. No, we're in too deep now for that.

425
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,520
If Eisenhower isn't coming,
blame it on him, not on Winston.

426
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:02,280
The Queen must never know
how much we've kept from her.

427
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:35,120
Prepare for inspection!

428
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:41,720
Sorry to disturb you, Ma'am.

429
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:46,880
I've been asked by Downing Street
to inform you first

430
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:50,920
that President Eisenhower is no longer
able to leave the United States,

431
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,400
owing to a political crisis at home.

432
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,600
Well, that's a relief.

433
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:03,000
And that the Prime Minister
still hasn't shaken off his cold.

434
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:05,520
And will not be attending
today's private audience.

435
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:08,440
Really? Goodness.

436
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:11,640
That's the second consecutive
private audience that he's missed.

437
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:14,400
-It's most unlike him.
-Yes, isn't it?

438
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,360
Are you all right, Martin?

439
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:21,640
Your Majesty, I've had the opportunity

440
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:26,560
to think about your very kind offer
to become your Private Secretary.

441
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,520
And I'm afraid I must decline.

442
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:34,240
Why?

443
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:41,840
In this instance, I really do believe
you'll be better served by Michael.

444
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:45,040
No, you don't.

445
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:49,760
-Ma'am?
-You don't think that.

446
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:54,920
Nor could you ever think that. For the
very good reason that it's not true.

447
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,200
Have you been spoken to
by Tommy Lascelles?

448
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:00,800
-Ma'am.
-You have.

449
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,440
And what did he have to say?

450
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,480
That I should've refused the offer
in the room.

451
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:11,840
That I obviously have no respect
or understanding

452
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:16,800
for Palace tradition and protocol,
and that it must be Michael Adeane.

453
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,360
Did he now?

454
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:27,040
If you'll excuse me for a moment, Martin?

455
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:57,800
Come.

456
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,520
Oh.

457
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:04,000
-Your Majesty.
-Look, Tommy.

458
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:08,080
There's no pretty way of saying this,
I would prefer Martin.

459
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:13,440
-And that is your right, Ma'am.
-Yes. And I rather thought so, too.

460
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,400
But it would be a mistake.

461
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:19,040
-And why is that?
-Please.

462
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,280
There's a way of doing things here.

463
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:37,040
An order developed over time, generations.

464
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:43,160
And individuality
in the House of Windsor,

465
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:47,560
any departure from that way
of doing things, is not to be encouraged.

466
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:50,480
It results in catastrophes
like the abdication.

467
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,800
Abdicating the Throne
and choosing my Private Secretary

468
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:56,840
-is hardly comparing like with like.
-I disagree.

469
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,480
I served your uncle, as you know.

470
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:05,000
And it's in the small things
that the rot starts.

471
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:07,720
Do the wrong thing once,
it's easier to do it again.

472
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:12,760
Do the individualistic thing once,
it is easy to do it again.

473
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:16,600
Now, in the case of your uncle,
it started with wanting to use

474
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:19,880
Buckingham Palace simply as the office
and York House as his home.

475
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:25,800
Then he stopped attending church,
decided he wanted to sell Sandringham.

476
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:28,200
He dismissed courtiers
who'd served under his father

477
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:32,040
in favor of younger,
sycophantic supplicants.

478
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:34,440
Of course,
no one saw the abdication coming then,

479
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:37,920
but the ego, the willfulness,

480
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:42,200
the individualism, the rot had set in.

481
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:47,160
-Martin and I have an understanding.
-I don't deny it.

482
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:52,800
It would make me feel as if I had an ally,

483
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:57,600
friend almost,
in what can sometimes feel like a very...

484
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:13,120
Well...

485
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,760
The next in line and the senior
of my two deputies

486
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:22,920
and the natural heir is Michael.

487
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,520
-Your man.
-The right man.

488
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:35,520
But as always,
the final say is with you, Ma'am.

489
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:47,760
Thank you.

490
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:28,120
Just had the Palace on the phone,

491
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:30,120
requesting a private audience
this afternoon.

492
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:33,080
It seems the Queen wants to see you, sir.

493
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:35,080
Me?

494
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:53,240
What's all this about, Patrick?

495
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:55,240
-Don't know, sir.
-Can't you give me a clue?

496
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:02,960
Mr. Colville, Your Majesty.

497
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,080
-You asked to see me, Your Majesty?
-Yes, Jock.

498
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:15,400
You were my Private Secretary
for two years before Martin Charteris.

499
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:16,720
I was.

500
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:20,440
And it was my impression
that we always had a good understanding

501
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:24,080
and we were able to speak openly
with one another.

502
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:27,960
-Yes, of course.
-And trust one another,

503
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:31,200
speak plainly when matters
of real importance came up.

504
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:35,600
And before Her Majesty says anything else,
let me just say how sorry I am.

505
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:42,480
It's been agony. I tried to stop them,
I told them my opinion,

506
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,440
but they were so insistent
we keep it from you.

507
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:48,560
After the second one, I really was
of a mind to let you know the truth.

508
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:52,760
-Second what?
-Stroke, Ma'am.

509
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:56,880
But they insisted again,
everyone keep it quiet, say nothing.

510
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:01,880
I see.

511
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:08,960
And who was it
that was doing the insisting?

512
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:11,400
Lord Salisbury, Ma'am.

513
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:16,120
And the Prime Minister himself.
On the rare occasions he was conscious.

514
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:21,560
I see.

515
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:25,480
That is what you asked me here to discuss?

516
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:28,680
No.

517
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:31,840
I asked you here to discuss
whether I should take Michael Adeane

518
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:35,320
for my Private Secretary,
rather than Martin Charteris.

519
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:42,640
But what you've just told me
is far more important.

520
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:50,160
-No.
-Yes.

521
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:51,960
The slippery old so-and-so's.

522
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:57,000
It's rather worse than slippery, wouldn't
you say? Somewhat unconstitutional.

523
00:43:57,080 --> 00:44:03,080
-What are you going to do?
-Nothing, of course. That's my job.

524
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:07,480
-Do nothing and stay silent at all times.
-Is it?

525
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:10,960
From memory, and forgive me, Ma'am,
it's a while since I read Bagehot,

526
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:16,280
but in circumstances such as these,
is it not also your duty to act?

527
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:22,560
-I doubt it. I'd have to check.
-I think you know precisely.

528
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:26,840
Yes, it is.

529
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:32,480
But I can't just summon the brightest,
most formidable men in the country

530
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:35,240
and give them a dressing down,
like children.

531
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:38,840
Why?
You are in the right, they in the wrong.

532
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:42,280
Yes, but they're far more intelligent
than I am.

533
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:46,800
Any confrontation, they'd out-debate me,
out-think me and out-maneuver me.

534
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:49,800
But this isn't about education
or intelligence.

535
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:53,400
This is about integrity and principle.

536
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:57,240
Ma'am, you say you don't have what
it takes to do battle with these people.

537
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:58,600
You do.

538
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:02,200
You were drilled for years
in the finer points of our Constitution.

539
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:05,000
You know it better than me,
better than all of us.

540
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:08,720
You have the only education that matters.

541
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:10,880
So what would you have me do?

542
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:16,320
Summon them and give them
a good dressing down like children.

543
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:17,920
Why would they stand for that?

544
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,200
Because they're English,
male and upper class.

545
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:25,640
A good dressing down from Nanny
is what they most want in life.

546
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:32,920
Unconventional to the end, Professor.

547
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:39,880
Thank you, Professor.

548
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:44,240
I'm afraid I urgently need something
from Windsor Castle.

549
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:49,640
At least I think it's at Windsor.
It might be at Sandringham. Or Balmoral.

550
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:51,880
-Or it might be here.
-Ma'am.

551
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:22,280
Lord Salisbury, please.

552
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:26,560
If you wouldn't mind, Prime Minister.

553
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:50,160
Ma'am.

554
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:07,000
It has come to my attention
that for a period of time last week,

555
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:10,440
my Prime Minister was incapacitated.

556
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,840
And the Foreign Secretary, too.

557
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:19,320
And that you colluded
in keeping that information from me.

558
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:23,760
-Your Maj...
-No, it is not my job to govern.

559
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:27,640
But it is my job
to ensure proper governance.

560
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:35,000
But how can I do that if my ministers lie
and plot and hide the truth from me?

561
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:39,680
You have prevented me from doing my duty.

562
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:43,600
You have hampered and bamboozled
the proper functioning of the Crown.

563
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:48,200
How could you?

564
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:53,400
My own late father valued you greatly.

565
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:57,280
He believed the phrase,
"History teaches, never trust a Cecil."

566
00:48:57,360 --> 00:48:58,920
Deeply unfair.

567
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:03,880
Perhaps not.

568
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:19,360
You may go.

569
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:41,680
Prime Minister.

570
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:45,000
Please.

571
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,880
The Prime Minister, Your Majesty.

572
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:03,640
Your Majesty.

573
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:06,280
Winston.

574
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:20,240
I am just a young woman,
starting out in public service.

575
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:26,200
And I would never presume
to give a man, so much my senior,

576
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:30,480
and who has given this country so much,
a lecture.

577
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:34,280
However...

578
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:39,160
you were at my Coronation.

579
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:40,720
I was.

580
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:45,160
And you therefore heard for yourself
as I took the solemn oath

581
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:48,920
to govern the people of my realms

582
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:52,640
according to their respective laws
and customs.

583
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:59,560
Now, one of those customs
is that their elected Prime Minister

584
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:03,400
should be of reasonably sound
body and mind.

585
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:06,600
Not an outrageous expectation,
one would've thought.

586
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:08,160
No.

587
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:11,520
But it seems that you have not

588
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:14,800
been of sound body and mind
these past weeks.

589
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:21,360
And that you chose to withhold
that information from me.

590
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:28,880
A decision which feels like a betrayal,
not just of the covenant of trust

591
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:33,920
between us and the institutions
that we both represent,

592
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,520
but of our own personal relationship.

593
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:17,240
In 1867, Walter Bagehot wrote:

594
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:21,480
"There are two elements
of the Constitution:

595
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:25,280
the efficient and the dignified."

596
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:31,360
The monarch is the dignified
and the government, the efficient.

597
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:36,560
These two institutions only work

598
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:39,960
when they support each other,

599
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:42,800
when they trust one another.

600
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:50,280
Your actions, your breaking of that trust

601
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:55,320
was irresponsible and it might have had
serious ramifications

602
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:58,440
for the security of this country.

603
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:06,480
Is your health better now?

604
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:08,960
-It is.
-Good.

605
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:11,760
But is it sufficiently better?

606
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:15,560
Fit for office better?

607
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:18,920
I would ask you to consider your response

608
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:23,680
in light of the respect
that my rank and my office deserve,

609
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:28,040
not that which my age and gender
might suggest.

610
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:30,520
Ma'am...

611
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:36,880
I look at you now and I realize

612
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:41,560
that the time is fast approaching
for me to step down.

613
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:46,440
Not because I am unwell
or unfit for office,

614
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:52,320
but because you are ready.

615
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:57,120
And therefore
I have discharged my duty to your father.

616
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:04,960
With your blessing and your forgiveness,

617
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:09,760
I shall continue to serve as the leader
of Your Majesty's government.

618
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:17,640
Your Majesty.

619
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:55,280
Hello?

620
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:05,760
Hello.

621
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:08,360
Where have you been?

622
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:13,120
Oh, charity cricket match for
the National Playing Fields Association.

623
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:16,560
Spent some time at the airfield,
doing some rolls.

624
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:18,760
No cabinet approval. Don't tell anyone.

625
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:21,360
What are you dressed for?

626
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:24,400
Haven't you heard?
We've a State banquet this evening.

627
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:28,040
Haven't you heard? It's been cancelled.

628
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:31,040
Oh, Christ,
why doesn't anybody tell me anything?

629
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:32,560
Well, perhaps if you were here more.

630
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:34,800
I've read two books on Eisenhower
especially.

631
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:36,760
-Have you really?
-No.

632
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:40,280
You look nice.

633
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:43,800
-Do I?
-Something's different.

634
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:46,920
-What?
-I don't know. You seem...

635
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,680
I advise you to choose your next words
very carefully.

636
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:53,840
Taller, somehow.
Or is it just that I've shrunk?

637
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:56,440
There's nothing shrunken about you,
dearest.

638
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:57,440
Where are you going?

639
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,200
I've got an appointment
with my new Private Secretary.

640
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:04,040
-Oh, God. Tell him to bugger off.
-I can't do that.

641
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:07,880
And do what instead?

642
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:12,920
Two options:

643
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:17,600
either I get some stilts so I can reach
the heights of my new, tall woman...

644
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:20,040
Or?

645
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:26,720
Or...

646
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:30,560
she could get on her knees.

647
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:51,800
Major Adeane, Her Majesty requests
that your appointment might wait.

648
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:54,240
-I see.
-Until tomorrow.

649
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:56,800
Right.
