1
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:03,960
In seeking his British
nationalization, His Royal Highness

2
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:07,440
Prince Philip of Greece and of Denmark

3
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:11,800
-renounces his Greek nationality...
-Here, sir.

4
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:15,880
...and all foreign titles.

5
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:22,520
And, from henceforth, he will be known as
Lieutenant Philip Mountbatten, Royal Navy.

6
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:23,600
And here.

7
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,520
Philip Mountbatten...

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I...

9
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,640
I...

10
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,840
I...

11
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:05,120
I grant you and the heirs,
male of your body,

12
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:11,800
lawfully begotten,
the dignities of Baron Greenwich,

13
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:19,160
Earl of Merioneth
and Duke of Edinburgh.

14
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,880
And Knight Companion

15
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:26,440
of our Most Noble Order of the Garter.

16
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,160
-Congratulations.
-Thank you, sir.

17
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,600
-Well done.
-Thank you.

18
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,280
Yes.

19
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,440
And?

20
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:22,360
They got through it. I got through it.

21
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,840
I think they'd have preferred
a nice, pink-faced marquis

22
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,560
with a grouse moor
in the Scottish Borders.

23
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,880
Are you sure you wouldn't have
preferred one of those?

24
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:36,720
Someone with a grand title,
rather than a homeless Charlie Kraut?

25
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,920
No.

26
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:42,200
-Oh.
-That would have all been very antiseptic.

27
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:53,440
Must you really smoke?
You know how I hate it.

28
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,880
Pity. Because I love it so very much.

29
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:00,840
But, like a great many other things,
I'm going to give it all up for you.

30
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,760
Well, you still have 24 hours
to change your mind.

31
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,080
You think I can change my mind
after all that?

32
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,680
No. Too late.

33
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,680
-I've signed myself away.
-Or won the greatest prize on Earth.

34
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,440
That's certainly what they think.

35
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:22,800
Sir.

36
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,360
It's what I think, too.

37
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,360
Watch out.

38
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,560
See you tomorrow.

39
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,120
Try and get some sleep.

40
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,440
You too.

41
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:06,080
A naval officer's stag night?
Chance would be a fine thing.

42
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,880
Thank you.

43
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,800
Question for you both.

44
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:40,520
Spot of blood in my spittle
yesterday morning.

45
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:44,280
-Ought I be concerned?
-Well, I'm not a doctor, sir.

46
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:48,480
-If it's just specks, sir...
-It was.

47
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:53,840
It's probably just the cold weather.
Gets right to the back of the throat.

48
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:56,640
Cold weather. That's what I thought.

49
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,960
The carriage will be cold too, Peter.

50
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,160
I've arranged for there
to be hot water bottles, sir.

51
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,240
Oh, well done.

52
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,480
Oh, for Christ's sakes, James!

53
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,120
You're making bloody hard going
out of this collar!

54
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:21,360
-Sorry, sir. Nearly there.
-You're doing it on purpose!

55
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:25,920
Now, sir, we're not going to let something
as small as a collar agitate us, are we?

56
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:34,720
No, thank you, James.
Sir, eyes front. Chin up.

57
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:42,320
There was a young lady named Sally,

58
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:46,400
who enjoyed the occasional dally,

59
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:51,680
she sat on the lap
of a well-endowed chap

60
00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:00,160
and cried,
"Sir! You're right up my alley!"

61
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,320
Right.

62
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,560
There was an old Countess of Bray,

63
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,840
and...

64
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,240
you may think it odd when I say

65
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:24,080
that despite her high station,
rank and education...

66
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,440
Your Majesty.

67
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:29,760
...she always spelled cunt with a K.

68
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,720
Shall we?

69
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,600
You look beautiful

70
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,040
You'll be fine.

71
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,120
All right.

72
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,920
Here we go.

73
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,640
Slow down.

74
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,320
Are we the last?

75
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,280
-Yes, sir.
-Good.

76
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,360
-Come along, Winston.
-Wait, wait, wait.

77
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:03,720
Now!

78
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,640
Has Winston no shame?

79
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:30,120
It's a royal wedding,
not a campaign trail.

80
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,080
He's outrageous.

81
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,600
But you have to admire him.

82
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,280
There's poor old Attlee.
He's our prime minister.

83
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,640
-No one got up for him.
-Yeah.

84
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,600
No, no.

85
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:52,160
Winston still thinks
he's the father of the nation.

86
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:16,360
This whole thing's Mountbatten's triumph.
He engineered it all.

87
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,080
The man who gave away India.

88
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:38,160
Dearly beloved,

89
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:42,440
we are gathered together
here in the sight of God,

90
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:46,080
and in the face of this congregation,

91
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:52,200
to join together this man and this woman

92
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,320
in holy matrimony.

93
00:12:56,280 --> 00:13:01,160
Who giveth this woman
to be married to this man?

94
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,200
- I, Philip...
- I, Philip...

95
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:19,560
take thee, Elizabeth Alexandra Mary.

96
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:22,480
...take thee, Elizabeth Alexandra Mary.

97
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,720
You know why
his three sisters aren't here?

98
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,440
- They're all married to Nazis!
- Do shut up!

99
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:30,320
Prominent Nazis!

100
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:35,720
I, Elizabeth Alexandra Mary...

101
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,000
I, Elizabeth Alexandra Mary...

102
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:41,680
take thee, Philip...

103
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,240
...take thee, Philip...

104
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,640
to my wedded husband.

105
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,560
...to my wedded husband.

106
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,680
To have and to hold...

107
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:00,360
To have and to hold...

108
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,880
To have and to hold...

109
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,320
from this day forward...

110
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,960
...from this day forward...

111
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:16,320
-for better, for worse...
-...for better, for worse...

112
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:19,720
-for richer, for poorer...
-...for richer, for poorer...

113
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:24,000
-in sickness and in health...
-...in sickness and in health...

114
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:30,080
to love, to cherish, and to obey.

115
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,880
-"Obey"?
-She insisted.

116
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,880
It was discussed.

117
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,920
And obey.

118
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,960
...to love and cherish and obey...

119
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:52,360
-till death us do part.
-...till death us do part.

120
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,600
- Sheer perfection.
- Your Highness...

121
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:03,120
You have to hand it to her.
It's quite a victory.

122
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,840
There wasn't a single person
supported the match.

123
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:09,600
Not a single ally at Court
or in government.

124
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,080
Yet here we all are.

125
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:15,440
Utterly divine.
May we have the groom's family, please?

126
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,480
She turned us all on our heads.

127
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:20,600
And barely opened her mouth
in the process.

128
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:24,640
-You overestimate her.
-You underestimate her.

129
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,480
Well, in the past 48 hours,
reality has sunk in.

130
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,640
With Philip's family.

131
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,440
Would you look at the mother?

132
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:42,480
-Just out of a sanatorium, I heard.
-And dressed as a nun.

133
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,160
- Are we ready? One...
- A Hun nun.

134
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,640
<i>Ein, zwei, drei.</i>

135
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,280
<i>Gutte schön.</i>

136
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,200
To me, please.
Are we ready?

137
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:56,400
Quite magnificent. Thank you, thank you.

138
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,600
Your Majesties?

139
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:13,280
That's quite charming.
Are we ready?

140
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,680
Thank you.

141
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:19,920
-What's that?
-This present is from me.

142
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,960
-Can I open it?
-Mm-hm.

143
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,080
Oh, Papa!

144
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,160
If your...

145
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:37,240
marriage is as happy as mine has been,

146
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:41,240
I don't want you to miss a single thing.

147
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,320
Lilibet? They're waiting.

148
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,320
Thank you.

149
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:50,720
Put it in.

150
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,440
-Bertie?
-Are you ready?

151
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,960
Everyone ready? Margaret?

152
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,680
-Sir.
-Thank you.

153
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,040
Thank you.

154
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:45,480
We want the king!
We want the king!

155
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:02,680
Row! Row you, bastards!

156
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,960
Everyone inside. We're starting now.

157
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:39,760
Thank you so much for coming.
Oh, good, you're here!

158
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:43,240
Right, come on, you two, inside.
Can't start without you.

159
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,240
-Boys, come on.
-Yes, ma'am.

160
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,240
Thank you.

161
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,480
Ladies and gentlemen, pray silence for
Her Royal Highness, Princess Elizabeth.

162
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,760
Thank you, Martin.

163
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,800
As I'm sure you all know,

164
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:09,120
my dear husband will soon
no longer be Lieutenant Mountbatten

165
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,680
but Lieutenant-Commander Mountbatten.

166
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,880
Thank you very much.

167
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:19,920
Which, I gather, involves a whole new
gold ring for me to sew onto your uniform!

168
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,800
Half a gold ring, darling.
Half a gold ring, gentlemen.

169
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:29,600
So I've asked the two most important
people here to do the presentation.

170
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,960
Hello? Charteris. Yes?

171
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,280
Ah.

172
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,600
Very good.

173
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:50,160
There we are.
Good boy, Charles, well done!

174
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,160
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

175
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,880
Important call from London, ma'am.

176
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,080
Charles! Anne!

177
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,600
Children. Wait. Wait.

178
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,640
They're waiting
in the green drawing room, ma'am.

179
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,000
-Right.
-Where's grandpapa?

180
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,400
He's upstairs with the doctors.

181
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,240
Now, you wait with nanny
and we'll be back in a minute.

182
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:13,080
Charles, wait. Here. Okay?

183
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,080
-Mummy.
-So glad you're here.

184
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:26,040
-We came as soon as we could.
-I know.

185
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,760
-Ma'am, I'm so sorry...
-Granny.

186
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,320
They're operating.

187
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:37,360
It's been two hours.

188
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,520
He's here.

189
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,040
I'm happy to say the procedure went well,

190
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:09,920
and that His Majesty's immediate
post-operative condition is satisfactory.

191
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,320
Thank you, doctor.

192
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:24,000
That's good news, isn't it?
Yes. Are you all right?

193
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,920
<i>...after the votes are finally counted,</i>

194
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,840
<i>Winston Churchill is Prime Minister</i>

195
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:11,840
<i>of Great Britain and Northern Ireland</i>
<i>once again.</i>

196
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:14,000
<i>After the Conservative Party</i>
<i>achieved a narrow...</i>

197
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,040
No bacon.

198
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,760
A little bacon won't hurt, surely, Gerald?
It's been five weeks.

199
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,400
Let's cool this down.

200
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:26,720
And make sure that egg is well-plated
and no shell to risk irritation.

201
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:30,240
And turn that noise off.
He'll still be prime minister tomorrow.

202
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,720
-Ready?
-Ready.

203
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,360
Let's get him back on his feet.

204
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,880
<i>...who took office aged 83.</i>

205
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,240
<i>We await the announcement</i>
<i>of the new Cabinet in the coming days.</i>

206
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:47,960
Good morning, Your Majesty.

207
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:52,800
-Your first day back at work.
-Who won?

208
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,240
Who, who won?

209
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:59,040
Mr. Churchill, Your Majesty. By 17 seats.

210
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,840
Good for him! You didn't hear me say that.

211
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:04,040
<i>...Mr. Winston Churchill.</i>

212
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:09,800
They keep trying to count him out,

213
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,560
but he keeps getting back up.

214
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:18,800
<i>...and happy moment,</i>
<i>to be elected for the second time,</i>

215
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,800
<i>as your Prime Minister.</i>

216
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:31,600
What this nation needs is several years

217
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:37,520
of strong, steady,
experienced administration.

218
00:25:56,680 --> 00:26:00,400
Congratulations, sir.
Dr. Moran is here for you.

219
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:11,120
Yes, you just won a General Election,
but...

220
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:16,600
155 over 90.

221
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,240
We can do better, Winston.

222
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,400
Have a look at this for me, will you?

223
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:31,400
In the war, we used mathematicians
to decode the indecipherable.

224
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,840
I need an expert
to cut through the jargon.

225
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,800
Are they keeping something from me?

226
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:43,240
Well, I wouldn't be unduly concerned
about the man's pneumatics.

227
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,120
And, given his age, and he's a smoker.

228
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,360
Catarrhal inflammation,
it's not that unusual.

229
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:52,040
But I would be concerned
about the bronchoscopy.

230
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:54,320
They wouldn't have done that
unless they were looking

231
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,360
for something far more serious.

232
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:59,400
And they conspicuously fail
to mention the results.

233
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:03,280
Instead they go on
about the lung resection.

234
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:07,640
Which they performed
because of "structural alterations".

235
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:11,840
What are structural alterations?

236
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:14,080
It's what doctors say
when they avoid using the word

237
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:16,800
that it almost inevitably describes.

238
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,600
Who is this man?

239
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,080
Just a little.

240
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,640
One doesn't want to overdo it.

241
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:38,200
One doesn't want to look ill, either.

242
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,200
A sick...

243
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,000
king is no good to anyone.

244
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:49,600
There must be no weakness.

245
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:52,440
No vulnerability.

246
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,400
Oh, thank you.

247
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:11,040
<i>Evening Chronicle! Evening Chronicle!</i>

248
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,640
-What's that?
-An armchair, sir.

249
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:35,840
-I just thought, a man of his age...
-This one never sits. Get rid of it.

250
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,600
Mr. Churchill, Your Majesty.

251
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:45,920
Your Majesty.

252
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:49,520
The people have spoken.

253
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:53,480
Your party has won the election,

254
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:57,120
and as... as their Sovereign,

255
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:00,200
I invite you to form a government
in my name.

256
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:03,200
An honor I gratefully accept.

257
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:07,320
My dear Winston. Congratulations.

258
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:13,240
Would it be terribly unconstitutional
of me to say how happy I am?

259
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:17,360
I've missed our weekly chats.

260
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:24,600
Your predecessor
is a fine parliamentarian.

261
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,720
A good man.

262
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:32,440
But, well, as company, as a companion...

263
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:37,360
An empty taxi pulled up at the House
of Commons, and Mr. Attlee got out.

264
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,960
Quite.

265
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:46,960
Now you may congratulate me in return.

266
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,760
What for?

267
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,600
My rapid recovery.

268
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:54,400
-Oh.
-Yes.

269
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:58,680
I seem to have bounced back
a lot quicker than people expected.

270
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,480
Yes.

271
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:05,040
Not sure I ever imagined what breathing
through one lung would feel like.

272
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:08,760
Turns out there's barely any difference.

273
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,800
Good. Good.

274
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:20,920
Though... probably wise
to let the Princess Elizabeth

275
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,880
undertake the Commonwealth tour? Hm?

276
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,480
What say you?

277
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,520
-Is she up to it?
-Yes, I'd say so.

278
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:37,440
Besides... we have to start
breaking her in gently, don't we?

279
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,360
Do we?

280
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,560
Keep one eye on the future.

281
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,560
The distant future.

282
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,920
- Welcome back, sir.
- What's this?

283
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,360
-It's the teleprinter.
-Let's have it upstairs.

284
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,480
-Everything as it was before, sir?
-Yes!

285
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:31,640
Everything exactly as it was before.

286
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:36,520
Ladies. Ladies. Now-- Who's this?

287
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:41,040
-Oh, Miss Venetia Scott, sir.
-A new addition.

288
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:44,520
-A good one, I'd say.
-Thank you, sir.

289
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,800
I had hoped
I'd seen the back of this place.

290
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:52,400
Could you give us a moment,
please, Jock?

291
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,480
Thank you.

292
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,920
How was the king?

293
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:04,880
He talked a great deal about his recovery.
Lots of mentions of "bouncing back".

294
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:07,840
Which always makes one fear the worst.

295
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,600
Not to mention the make-up.

296
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,200
He was wearing rouge.

297
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,560
Poor man.

298
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,080
It's cancer.

299
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,400
What?

300
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:32,640
-Who knows?
-No one.

301
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,800
Least of all him.

302
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:40,880
-Sir? Lunch.
-Let's have it in here.

303
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:44,400
See what they've been serving
for the past five years.

304
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:49,560
-So he's dying?
-We're all dying.

305
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:53,760
That's what defines
the condition of living.

306
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,920
Will he die tomorrow? No.

307
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,560
What about the day after tomorrow?
And the day after that?

308
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:02,080
The country needs to be led
by someone strong.

309
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:06,240
-Well, I'm strong!
-You are also tired, Winston.

310
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,160
We both are.

311
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:11,080
A situation like that
would require enormous energy.

312
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,400
And I won't lie to you.

313
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:18,360
I have considered resigning
for Anthony's sake.

314
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:19,880
For your sake.

315
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:25,440
But then I realized a situation like that
would also require statesmanship.

316
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:28,400
The party needs me.
The country needs me.

317
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,040
She needs me.

318
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:32,880
-Who?
-Her!

319
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:35,720
Oh, her.

320
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:41,360
This is Clarence House
dining room to Clarence House kitchen.

321
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,880
Dining room to kitchen.

322
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:47,520
- Dining room to kitchen!
- Yes. Dining room to kitchen!

323
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:48,600
Oh, bugger it!

324
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:51,960
Right, check the circuits
and up the amperage of the fuse wire.

325
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,640
Right, I'm off.

326
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:56,480
-Breakfast with your mother?
-And Margaret.

327
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:59,800
Imagine.
I'm checking curtain fabrics in an hour.

328
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:02,240
Yes.

329
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:06,960
Let's pick the curtains.

330
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:10,200
-Where to, ma'am?
-Buckingham Palace, please.

331
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:14,720
Buckingham Palace.

332
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,680
I see.

333
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:26,200
The queen has asked to see you.

334
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:29,480
Yes, we look forward
to seeing the doctor then.

335
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:31,920
-Thank you. Goodbye.
-Drawing room!

336
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,920
-Now?
-Yes.

337
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:43,440
We do both so love
living at Clarence House

338
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:46,640
and he has all sorts of ideas
about how to modernize it.

339
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:48,800
He really is rather ingenious like that,
actually.

340
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:52,040
-Now, Peter.
-Your Majesty. Your Royal Highnesses.

341
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:54,600
I have to make a decision
about Christmas.

342
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:58,520
Tell me, do you think the King will be
well enough to go to Sandringham?

343
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:01,080
I do. As a matter of fact,
I think it would do him good.

344
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:04,880
-So it's decided.
-Will you be joining us, too?

345
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,320
Me?

346
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:12,360
Course not. Peter will be spending
Christmas at home with his family.

347
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:14,440
I was only thinking of papa.

348
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:17,080
Given the choice, you know
he'd never let him out of his sight.

349
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:18,880
Well, that's true.

350
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:22,760
-He's quite devoted to you.
-Then let me discuss it with Rosemary.

351
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:25,800
Oh, no. No, it's out of the question.

352
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:30,360
Why, mummy? Let Peter discuss it.

353
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,760
-Well, he did offer.
-Oh, very well.

354
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:38,360
But, as a wife,
I know what my answer would be.

355
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:41,880
I'd want my husband at home
at Christmas with his children.

356
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,040
Excuse me.

357
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:57,560
I saw that.

358
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:01,960
What? No, I haven't finished.

359
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,800
That look between the two of you.

360
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:10,480
-Oh, Margaret!
-You must tell no one.

361
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:13,600
The papers all think I'm for
Johnny Dalkeith or Billy Wallace.

362
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:17,480
-Mummy and Papa, too, by the way.
-They're just boys. Whereas Peter is...

363
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:20,280
No, I quite see the attraction of Peter.

364
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,520
But he's married.

365
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:40,840
Doctor Weir, Your Majesty.

366
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:51,120
You told me that, after the operation,

367
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:56,080
I might expect some... soreness,

368
00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:00,600
some difficulty breathing.

369
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:04,840
But you didn't tell me about this.

370
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,960
-The coughing has returned?
-Yes.

371
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:10,000
-How often?
-All the time.

372
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:18,200
At the time of the operation, as you know,
structural alterations were discovered.

373
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:20,480
Of course. The blockage in the lung.

374
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,480
It's time we gave that blockage a name,
sir.

375
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:28,040
It was a tumor.

376
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,240
A malignant tumor.

377
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,280
I see.

378
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:45,080
-But... we removed it?
-We did.

379
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:48,320
So what is this?

380
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:51,480
We removed the left lung, sir.
But the right...

381
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:58,040
has fewer,
but still significant, blockages.

382
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,400
So, what's next?

383
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,280
Next?

384
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:27,320
I argued that His Majesty
should be told at the time.

385
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:30,600
A patient has a right
to know the full picture.

386
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:33,840
But I was overruled. The theory was that,
if His Majesty felt he'd been cured,

387
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:38,520
he could throw himself into his work
without undue stress and, and, and worry.

388
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:58,560
I have two questions.

389
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,520
Who knows the full picture?

390
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:05,640
Apart from the surgeons?

391
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,720
Perhaps the Prime Minister, sir.

392
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,280
Of course.

393
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,280
But not the queen?

394
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:25,280
-Nor anyone else in my family?
-No, sir.

395
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,400
And the second question?

396
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,640
It's impossible to say, sir.

397
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:45,760
My understanding is the surgeons
did everything they could.

398
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,920
And?

399
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,720
It could be years.

400
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:57,520
More likely months.

401
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,360
Thank you.

402
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:37,120
Merry Christmas.

403
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:51,400
Come on.

404
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:23,800
- Oh, look.
- Oh...

405
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:42,800
Charming. Quite charming.

406
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:56,000
Thank you.

407
00:43:57,840 --> 00:44:00,240
Thank you. Thank you.

408
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:08,480
Very good. Charles, come on.

409
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:10,440
-Alright.
-No, Mummy.

410
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:15,000
Ma'am, His Majesty has requested
you attend him in his study.

411
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:18,240
Urgently requested, ma'am.

412
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:20,560
Alright.

413
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:23,440
Will you take them?

414
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:24,520
I'll be back soon.

415
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:29,840
Off we go then!

416
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:42,240
In case you're wondering,
I haven't anything specific to say.

417
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:45,080
Just wanted to spend time with you.

418
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:56,680
If there's anything you wanted to ask me,
just fire away.

419
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:01,000
Are they a nuisance?

420
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:03,560
Oh, the boxes.

421
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:06,000
Not if you keep on top of them.

422
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:10,160
-Even at Christmas.
-Even at Christmas.

423
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:13,560
Well, what's inside?

424
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:17,120
Everything they want me to know,
they stick on top.

425
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:19,680
Everything they'd rather I didn't know,

426
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:23,280
Cabinet meetings,
Foreign Office briefings,

427
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:25,600
they tuck away at the bottom.

428
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:32,000
Which is why... the first thing I do
when no one is looking, is this.

429
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:41,760
Will you take that? Thank you.

430
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:57,000
Yeah.

431
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:16,000
Don't you get sick of it all?

432
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:19,880
I do.

433
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:22,680
And lonely?

434
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:26,680
Sometimes.

435
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:31,800
Which is why it's so important
to have the right person by your side.

436
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:35,720
I've been very lucky in that regard
with your mother.

437
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:39,720
How's your fellow?

438
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:42,160
-Philip?
-Mm.

439
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:45,960
Well, he...

440
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:51,800
Well, I'm afraid he's become something
of a snagaholic.

441
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:52,880
A what?

442
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:57,160
Well, you know we're renovating Clarence
House to make it our permanent home?

443
00:46:57,240 --> 00:46:58,200
Mm, yes.

444
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:01,000
Well, ever since he started
supervising the work,

445
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:04,040
he can't look at anything
without seeing its faults.

446
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:08,840
"That switch is an inch too high.
And that door handle's wrong."

447
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:11,880
"Well, don't be silly," I say.
"A handle's a handle."

448
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:13,640
I should make more of an effort with him.

449
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:17,440
Take him shooting.

450
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:20,040
-Would he like that?
-Yes, I think he'd love it.

451
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:22,800
And then when your health's improved,
we'll return to Malta

452
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:26,200
and he'll have his navy again,
and all will be well.

453
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:27,680
Of course.

454
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:34,840
But, in the meantime...
I'm still not yet well enough to travel.

455
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:38,160
Not long distances, anyway.

456
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:41,800
Which brings me
to the forthcoming Commonwealth tour.

457
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:46,200
I was wondering if you would consider
stepping into my shoes, so to speak.

458
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:52,840
My health is improving
but I'm still not yet well enough.

459
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:57,920
-Well, if you think we're up to it.
-You'll be fine.

460
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:02,280
-Where is it?
-Well...

461
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:05,080
Ceylon. Australia.

462
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:07,800
Then on to New Zealand. Bermuda.

463
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:10,160
And there's talk of starting in Kenya.

464
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:11,920
Very good!

465
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,640
Right, we'll be gone months.

466
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:18,680
Yes. But it would mean so much
to papa that we do it.

467
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:23,400
-What am I supposed to do all that time?
-Don't worry, we'll put you to work.

468
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:25,280
My work is as a naval officer,

469
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:28,280
not grinning like a demented ape
while you cut ribbons!

470
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:31,800
-What about the children?
-The children will be fine.

471
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:35,560
Oh! Without their parents
for months on end?

472
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:39,000
-Daddy, can you come and play?
-I won't be a moment, darling.

473
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:41,560
If you go and play with grandpapa,
I'll be right over. Good boy.

474
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:44,560
Come on, darling,
Daddy's busy. Come and start again.

475
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:46,880
- Daddy's coming.
- They won't know.

476
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:49,320
-They're too young to notice.
-Come on. Be quiet.

477
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:51,480
It would so help in papa's recovery.

478
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:56,040
Charles, come back here.

479
00:48:56,120 --> 00:48:59,240
- Daddy, can you play now?
- Charles.

480
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:06,440
Yes.

481
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:10,880
Thank you.

482
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:13,760
- What are we playing?
- Granny's footsteps.

483
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:15,960
Come on then. Let's go.
And then it's bedtime.

484
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:18,200
Ready, steady...

485
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:40,760
Sir?

486
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:57,520
-What's the weather like today?
-Rather misty at the moment, sir.

487
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:02,360
-Morning!
-Bugger off!

488
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:09,320
Yes, I'm not sure that's the correct
address for the King of England.

489
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:12,080
-It's a beautiful morning for duck.
-What?

490
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:14,760
I thought Wolferton Splash.

491
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:21,680
Christ.

492
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:31,400
Reed warbler, see?

493
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:37,240
Oh, Teal. Below the withy there.

494
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:41,480
When I woke up this morning, I thought
we'd go to Babingley Flat or Eleven Acres.

495
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:44,440
But, in the end,
there's nowhere better than the Splash

496
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:47,680
with a bagful of cartridges
to lift the spirits.

497
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:49,720
His Majesty's back to himself again.

498
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:53,080
Oh, he is, thank you.
Like a young man again.

499
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:04,200
We'll be all right.
My son-in-law's a naval man.

500
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:07,160
We will. If I can handle a frigate.

501
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:28,200
You understand, the titles,
the... dukedom.

502
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,800
-They're not the job.
-Sir?

503
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:38,200
She is the job.

504
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:43,160
She is the essence of your duty.

505
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:45,760
Loving her.

506
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:49,240
Protecting her.

507
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:55,040
Of course, you'll miss your career.

508
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:01,520
But doing this for her,
doing this for me...

509
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:07,840
there may be no greater act of patriotism.

510
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:10,680
Or love.

511
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:17,240
I understand, sir.

512
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:20,920
Do you, boy?

513
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:24,360
Do you really?

514
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:30,880
I think so.

515
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:43,240
Come.

516
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:45,720
Let's go shoot some duck, shall we?

517
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:47,320
Three cheers for His Majesty!

518
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:49,400
- Hip, hip!
- Hooray!

519
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:51,400
- Hip, hip!
- Hooray!

520
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:53,160
- Hip, hip!
- Hooray!

521
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:55,680
You're too kind. Thank you.
