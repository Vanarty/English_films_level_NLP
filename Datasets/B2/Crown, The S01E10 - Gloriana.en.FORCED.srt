1
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:25,480
I am delighted to be here in Cairo

2
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:28,560
to meet with Colonel Nasser...

3
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:31,600
<i>to continue discussions</i>
<i>regarding the funding</i>

4
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,280
<i>for his grand Aswan Dam project.</i>

5
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,600
His Arabic is good.

6
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,520
Very good.

7
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,480
Too good.

8
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:15,040
Your Excellency Secretary Eden.

9
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,880
Is anything the matter?

10
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:22,600
No one told me
it was formal dress tonight.

11
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:27,760
No matter, sir. It's just a suit.

12
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,640
But the wrong suit.

13
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:41,840
If I was as decorated as you, sir,

14
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:47,800
I would wear my uniform all the time.
Wouldn't take it off.

15
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:52,360
You think I don't know?

16
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:59,360
That you received the Military Cross
for bravery in the First World War,

17
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:03,760
and were the youngest brigade-major
in the British Army, at 21.

18
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:09,280
You are more decorated than me...

19
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:27,800
<i>Britain and the West despise Arabs.</i>

20
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:32,080
<i>Prime Minister Eden thinks</i>
<i>he can insult us.</i>

21
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:37,360
<i>We will fight to the last drop</i>
<i>of our blood.</i>
