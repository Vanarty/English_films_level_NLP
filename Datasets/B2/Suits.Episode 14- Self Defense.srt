00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:02,709
would have asked me
up until this point,

173
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:04,540
I would have sworn
that you did.

174
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:05,879
I would have sworn
that I saw you

175
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,610
at that--that
party with Gilcrest

176
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:09,289
or those pizza nights
at Pinocchio's

177
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:12,119
or pretty much any other memory
I have of that time,

178
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,350
which means, if they put me
up there on that stand,

179
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:17,689
I'd basically be
telling the truth.

180
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:20,220
I can't tell you how much that
means to me, Harold, but...

181
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:22,299
Mike, I want to
do this for you, please.

182
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,799
I know you do.

183
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,139
But I got myself
into this mess,

184
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:28,169
and I got to get
myself out of it.

185
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:29,160
Okay.

186
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:31,500
But listen,
if you change your mind,

187
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:33,910

191
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:41,989
but the truth is,
this case is about

192
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:43,660
nothing more
than cold, hard--

193
00:06:43,661 --> 00:06:45,650
Innuendo.

194
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:47,959
And the fact is, I'm capable
of reciting every element

195
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,959
of jurisprudence
in the state of New York.

196
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:52,299
And yet despite that,
the prosecution is gonna

197
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,129
try to convince you
that I am a--

198
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:56,799
Fraud, who not only
didn't pass the bar or go

199
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,199
to law school, he didn't
even graduate college.

200
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,660
There isn't one piece
of hard evidence

201
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:04,430
proving that I didn't go
to Harvard Law.

202
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,539
There's no record
of tuition being paid.

203
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:08,270
No record
of a Boston address.

204
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,279
There isn't even a simple
picture in the yearbook.

205
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,579
Let's talk about
the yearbook.

206
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:13,579
As he told you,
I'm not in the yearbook.

207
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:14,740
Where is Mike Ross?

208
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:16,280
Though what he didn't
tell you is that

209
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:18,519
25 other students
are also not in this yearbook.

210
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,180
Are those other students
being charged with fraud?

211
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:23,029
Of course not, because
we don't put people on trial

212
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:25,929
for being sick on picture day,
and no matter--

213
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:30,269
What he says, the fact is,
Mike Ross is not a lawyer.

214
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:31,699
He's a fraud.

215
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:35,030
And we will prove that
beyond a shadow of a doubt.

216
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,039
The defense would like
to call its first witness.

217
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,109
Right there--
he's such a non-lawyer,

218
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:41,050
he doesn't even know
the prosecution goes first.

219
00:07:41,051 --> 00:07:42,200
And you obviously don't know

220
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:44,970
Jarvis v. the State of New York,
1937,

221
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:46,340
when calling
of the first witness

222
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:48,149
is of such special nature
as to disrupt

223
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:50,980
the flow of the trial
once it's started.

224
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:53,059
What the hell special nature
are you talking about?

225
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:54,559
When the defense
wants to call the prosecutor

226
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,989
as its first witness.

227
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:58,150
Harvey, unless you have
something to overturn this,

228
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,750
I'm gonna need you
to have a seat.

229
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,769
Mr. Specter, you said
there's no record of me

230
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:06,799
ever having an apartment
in Boston.

231
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,700
Can you explain to the jury
why there's no record

232
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:09,939
of you ever having
lived there?

233
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:11,580
I'm not the one
on trial here.

234
00:08:11,581 --> 00:08:12,670
No, you're not.

235
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,779
You're the one in that chair,

236
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:14,979
so why don't you answer
the question,

237
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:16,579
or we can stop this whole thing
right now.

238
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,315
There's no record
of me living there

239
00:08:18,316 --> 00:08:21,310
because I sublet up there
when I had my place down here.

240
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,389
So it is possible

241
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:24,219
that a person not have
a Boston address

242
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:26,989
without it meaning that
they didn't attend Harvard.

243
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:29,459
Great.
Thank you so much.

244
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:31,289
This witness is excused.

245
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:32,790
And what, exactly,
is your reason

246
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,465
for not having
an address up there?

247
00:08:34,466 --> 00:08:37,290
Unless you're too afraid
to answer my questions.

248
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:39,139
No, I'm not afraid
of you at all.

249
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:40,969
My reason is that I chose
to live with my friend

250
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:42,609
Trevor during that time.

251
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:44,175
The only problem
with that is,

252
00:08:44,176 --> 00:08:46,839
your friend Trevor has lived
in Brooklyn his entire life.

253
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:49,140
Exactly a 3 hour and 20 minute
drive from Harvard.

254
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:51,215
So you're saying
you made that drive every day?

255
00:08:51,216 --> 00:08:52,540
No,
I only went up for tests

256
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:54,019
because that's
all I had to do.

257
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:56,689
I guess you needed
some extra tutoring, huh?

258
00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:59,089
You expect these people
to believe that you graduated

259
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:01,030
from the most competitive
law school in the world

260
00:09:01,031 --> 00:09:02,480
without ever going to class?

261
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:04,150
See, that's funny,
because you actually

262
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,399
expect these people
to believe

263
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,829
that I never went
to law school at all

264
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:08,499
and yet still somehow
managed to convince

265
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,335
the smartest lawyers
in the world

266
00:09:10,336 --> 00:09:12,890
to make me their
youngest partner ever.

267
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:17,030
Whose story is looking
more far-fetched now?

268
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:20,300
Oh, no answer?
Great.

269
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:21,610
No more questions,

00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:31,719

be made aware of?

Just talking about
the Knicks.

276
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:38,395
Now is the prosecution ready
to call their first witness?

277
00:09:38,396 --> 00:09:41,059
The prosecution's first
witness is this affidavit

278
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:43,220
from every single member
of the defendant's

279
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:44,790

Where's your proof?

Besides the fact that
I actually went to Harvard,

you could have contacted

the first time?

689

We were in Las Vegas--

690
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:05,589
Yeah, yeah, I don't
give a shit where you were.

691
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:07,590
What color was your dress?
What color was the cake?

692
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,099
- Objection.
- Who was there?

693
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:10,769
Were there any witnesses?
Your Honor, he's badgering--

694
00:24:10,770 --> 00:24:12,569
Who were the witnesses?
And what goddamn time was it?

695

- Tell me right now.

Let the witness answer.

698
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,009
The dress was white.

699
00:24:20,010 --> 00:24:23,009
And the cake was vanilla
with a buttercream frosting.

700
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:26,870
It was a small ceremony
at around 10:00 p.m.

701
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,710
And I remember
the man who married us

702
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,419
like it was yesterday

703
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:34,259
because it was the most
special day of my life.

704
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:35,589
And when you came up
with this story,

705
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:37,250
did Mr. Ross at least
give you the courtesy of

706
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:38,759
letting you make up
your own memories

707
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:39,999
of your supposedly
sacred day?

708
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,099
Objection.

709
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:42,969
Since, if he represents
himself at trial,

710
00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:45,899
you won't have a real wedding
for at least two to five years.

00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:46,930
Harvey.

712
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:48,439
And I've got
one more question:

713
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:52,039
did you vow to remain
faithful to Mr. Ross

714
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:53,339
throughout your marriage?

715
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:54,400
Yes, I did.

716
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:56,609
Yeah, then I guess
when you cheated on him

717
00:24:56,610 --> 00:24:59,270
with Logan Sanders,
it means you lied to him

718
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,940
at that non-existent ceremony,

719
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:03,219
just like you're lying
to all of us right now.

720
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:05,689
That's enough.

721
00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:07,759
If you want to bring more
outside information

722
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:12,489

feel free, but for right now...

00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:26,979

The only proof they'll ever
have that we knew about Mike

is if we tell them.

I'm going to take the Fifth,

the same thing.

Mike went to Harvard.

746
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:00,900
It was your decision
to hire him,

Mr. Evans, is it true that
you were living with Mr. Ross

861
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:23,969
in and around the time he claims
to have attended Harvard?

862
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:25,300
Yes, we shared an apartment

863
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:27,779
at 5307 Huntington Boulevard
in Brooklyn.

864
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:30,049
And how exactly
did he pay his rent?

865
00:30:30,050 --> 00:30:32,220
He worked as a bike messenger
and made money on the side

866
00:30:32,221 --> 00:30:33,970
taking the LSATs for people.

867
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:35,879
Oh, wait, I'm confused.

868
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,740
Why would he
have to resort to that

869
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:39,380
if he were
a college graduate?

870
00:30:39,390 --> 00:30:41,189
Because he wasn't
a college graduate.

871
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:42,859
What?

872
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:45,200
You mean he never
graduated from college?

873
00:30:45,201 --> 00:30:49,820
No, he was kicked out of
college for cheating on a test.

874
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:52,660
Well, isn't it possible

875
00:30:52,670 --> 00:30:55,669
that while he was
living with you,

876
00:30:55,670 --> 00:30:59,369
he went back to school
and completed his degree?

877
00:30:59,370 --> 00:31:01,370
Well, I don't see how,
since most of his spare time

878
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:03,509
was spent sitting around
smoking weed with me.

879
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:05,640
Well, let me
get this straight.

880
00:31:05,650 --> 00:31:08,419
Before he was employed
at Pearson Specter,

881
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:10,889
to the best of your knowledge,
he worked as

882
00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:15,019
a bike messenger and
a part-time LSAT imposter?

883
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:17,250
Yes.

884
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:19,159
One last question,
Mr. Evans.

885
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:21,629
Is it at all possible
that Mike Ross

886
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:27,169
ever attended
Harvard Law School?

887
00:31:27,170 --> 00:31:28,839

the street outside of your

1031
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:36,605
office and the two of you got
into a heated argument?

1032
00:37:36,606 --> 00:37:39,070
I have the pictures.
Would you like to see them?

1033
00:37:40,210 --> 00:37:42,039
Yes, it's true.

1034
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:43,800
And isn't it also true
that Mike Ross

1035
00:37:43,810 --> 00:37:45,870
got your aunt a large
settlement several months ago,

1036
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,379
and if he gets convicted,
it's likely

1037
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:49,079
that that settlement
gets overturned?

1038
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:50,680
Objection.
Calls for speculation.

1039
00:37:50,690 --> 00:37:52,689
He's a Harvard lawyer.
He's qualified to speculate.

1040
00:37:52,690 --> 00:37:54,959
- Overruled.
- No, you're right.

1041
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:57,129
It'd probably get overturned,

1042
00:37:57,130 --> 00:37:58,959
but if you think
that's why I said what I said,

1043

you don't know me.

because he's jealous,

for your aunt?
