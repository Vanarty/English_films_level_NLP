1
00:00:07,274 --> 00:00:09,174
You took this case
without running it by me.

2
00:00:09,175 --> 00:00:11,075
- Jessica...
- That's enough. Dump it.

3
00:00:11,078 --> 00:00:12,311
Or I will.

4
00:00:12,313 --> 00:00:13,312
You think this case is a winner?

5
00:00:13,314 --> 00:00:14,680
I do.

6
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:16,047
Then what do you say
we do it together?

7
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:17,883
(rachel) I'm afraid you're gonna
end up hating each other.

8
00:00:17,884 --> 00:00:19,717
If I'm lucky, I'm gonna fight
with him about a lot of things.

9
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:22,354
Why not start with a fight where
we're both on the same side?

10
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:24,256
This is harvey's
last three income statements,

11
00:00:24,258 --> 00:00:26,058
And I found them
sitting in the copy machine.

12
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:27,526
You came to work for me.

13
00:00:27,528 --> 00:00:28,794
You knew who I was when you did,

14
00:00:28,796 --> 00:00:30,229
So now it's time
for you to decide.

15
00:00:30,231 --> 00:00:31,363
Are you with me or not?

16
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:33,332
You always said,
once you pick a side,

17
00:00:33,334 --> 00:00:34,400
If you're not loyal
to that side,

18
00:00:34,402 --> 00:00:35,935
Then who the hell are you?

19
00:00:35,936 --> 00:00:37,469
You should've thought of that
before you picked someone

20
00:00:37,471 --> 00:00:39,511
Who would do something like this
in the first place.

21
00:00:40,474 --> 00:00:43,442
You ever take sides with
jack soloff against me again,

22
00:00:43,444 --> 00:00:45,511
I will bury you.

23
00:00:50,251 --> 00:00:52,651
[elevator bell dings]
- well, you look happy.

24
00:00:52,653 --> 00:00:54,686
Becky just tell susie
she like-likes you?

25
00:00:54,688 --> 00:00:57,189
Eh, more like kelton insurance
just told robert zane

26
00:00:57,191 --> 00:00:58,590
They're scared-scared of us.

27
00:00:58,592 --> 00:00:59,591
You got a settlement offer?

28
00:00:59,593 --> 00:01:01,160
Just like he said we would.

29
00:01:01,162 --> 00:01:03,328
I got to hand it to him,
he played them perfectly.

30
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:05,130
Did he now?

31
00:01:05,132 --> 00:01:06,165
What?

32
00:01:06,167 --> 00:01:07,199
Nothing.

33
00:01:07,201 --> 00:01:08,700
Look, I take it back
about becky.

34
00:01:08,702 --> 00:01:10,536
The only one with a crush
around here is you.

35
00:01:10,538 --> 00:01:12,271
Sounds like someone's worried
that robert zane

36
00:01:12,273 --> 00:01:14,390
Might be better than him.

37
00:01:14,391 --> 00:01:16,508
Nice try, tiger, but did magic
ever worry about bird?

38
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:17,509
First of all, yes, he did.

39
00:01:17,511 --> 00:01:18,900
Second of all, you realize

40
00:01:18,901 --> 00:01:20,290
You're the white guy
in this scenario, right?

41
00:01:20,291 --> 00:01:21,680
I know I'm the bigger badass
in every scenario.

42
00:01:21,682 --> 00:01:25,184
Okay, mr. Badass, which one
are you, magic or bird?

43
00:01:25,186 --> 00:01:26,351
I think we both know I'm...

44
00:01:26,353 --> 00:01:28,320
(both) jordan.

45
00:01:28,322 --> 00:01:30,823
Hey, why don't you go meet
your boyfriend robert zane?

46
00:01:30,825 --> 00:01:33,092
I think I just left something
at security.

47
00:01:33,094 --> 00:01:36,762
Oh. Look who like-likes
someone now.

48
00:01:36,764 --> 00:01:38,630
Ma'am, the last time
I let someone up

49
00:01:38,632 --> 00:01:40,365
That he wasn't expecting,

50
00:01:40,367 --> 00:01:42,234
He threatened
to have me executed.

51
00:01:42,236 --> 00:01:44,803
I'm sure he did,
but I'm telling you that...

52
00:01:44,805 --> 00:01:47,339
That gretchen obviously forgot
to phone down, carl,

53
00:01:47,341 --> 00:01:50,209
Because we have a meeting
scheduled for right now.

54
00:01:50,211 --> 00:01:51,410
That isn't what she just...

55
00:01:51,412 --> 00:01:54,179
Carl.

56
00:01:58,119 --> 00:02:00,752
A meeting with you. Really?

57
00:02:00,754 --> 00:02:02,588
I promise
I'm much better-looking

58
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:04,189
Than whoever
you were supposed to meet.

59
00:02:04,191 --> 00:02:07,426
You have no idea
how right you are.

60
00:02:07,428 --> 00:02:09,628
But I could have sworn
you were just on your way out.

61
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:12,131
Oh, that's not a problem.
The mayor can wait.

62
00:02:12,133 --> 00:02:14,766
But I'm not sure
the governor can.

63
00:02:14,768 --> 00:02:16,635
Are you trying
to out-name-drop me?

64
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:19,371
If I were, I think I just did.

65
00:02:19,373 --> 00:02:22,808
But I'll let you in
on a little secret.

66
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:25,344
I don't really care
about names that much.

67
00:02:25,346 --> 00:02:26,745
Well, if you don't care
about names, why don't we

68
00:02:26,747 --> 00:02:29,314
Skip the introductions
and just get down to breakfast?

69
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:30,749
What if I already had breakfast?

70
00:02:30,751 --> 00:02:33,552
I'm talking about
tomorrow morning, in my kitchen.

71
00:02:33,554 --> 00:02:36,421
Or yours, I mean, you look like
you have a nice place.

72
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:45,230
As tempting as that is,
maybe another time.

73
00:02:47,868 --> 00:02:49,301
Good luck in your meeting.

74
00:02:53,274 --> 00:02:56,241
So how's my favorite
pain-in-the-ass lawyer?

75
00:02:56,243 --> 00:02:58,777
I thought louis was your
favorite pain-in-the-ass lawyer.

76
00:02:58,779 --> 00:03:02,281
He is, but louis
isn't responsible

77
00:03:02,283 --> 00:03:04,283
For me getting to work on this.

78
00:03:07,588 --> 00:03:09,955
You're doing the grunt work
on our case?

79
00:03:09,957 --> 00:03:11,723
I pulled some strings...
Thought it might give us

80
00:03:11,725 --> 00:03:12,858
A chance to work together.

81
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:15,227
You know I'm engaged, right?

82
00:03:15,229 --> 00:03:16,628
Yes, mike, that's my plan,

83
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:18,497
To steal you
from my boss's daughter.

84
00:03:18,499 --> 00:03:21,600
It's a thing. It's been done.

85
00:03:21,602 --> 00:03:23,669
Well, I didn't come here
to steal you.

86
00:03:23,671 --> 00:03:26,471
I came here to thank you.

87
00:03:26,473 --> 00:03:27,473
For what?

88
00:03:27,474 --> 00:03:28,474
Come on, mike.

89
00:03:28,475 --> 00:03:30,659
I get fired,

90
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:32,844
And two days later, I get
an offer from rachel's father?

91
00:03:32,846 --> 00:03:36,381
Whatever you did, I owe you one.

92
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:38,383
Actually, you owe rachel one.

93
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:40,252
No shit.

94
00:03:40,254 --> 00:03:42,688
Shit.

95
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:45,757
(both as clay davis
from<i> the wire)</i> shiiit.

96
00:03:47,661 --> 00:03:50,729
By the way, you're
in the wrong conference room.

97
00:03:56,437 --> 00:03:58,237
Okay, esther,
what are you doing here?

98
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:00,439
What, a woman can't stop by

99
00:04:00,441 --> 00:04:01,907
To see her brother,
who she loves?

100
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:05,244
Please, you know damn well
we don't love each other.

101
00:04:05,246 --> 00:04:08,547
In that case, I need a lawyer.

102
00:04:08,549 --> 00:04:10,382
[laughs] you? For what?

103
00:04:10,384 --> 00:04:13,619
Did you give someone salmonella
with your stupid muffins?

104
00:04:13,621 --> 00:04:14,987
I'm getting a divorce.

105
00:04:18,626 --> 00:04:20,459
Well, good.

106
00:04:20,461 --> 00:04:22,327
I knew that guy was dead weight
the second I met him.

107
00:04:22,329 --> 00:04:24,863
I know, I think that was
your speech at our wedding.

108
00:04:24,865 --> 00:04:26,732
And your sympathy is touching,

109
00:04:26,734 --> 00:04:29,034
But I didn't come here
to vindicate you.

110
00:04:29,036 --> 00:04:30,302
No, I know you didn't.

111
00:04:30,304 --> 00:04:31,536
You came to get me

112
00:04:31,538 --> 00:04:33,772
To slaughter jeffrey for you,
and I will.

113
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:36,275
When I'm done with him,
he won't have a pot to shit in.

114
00:04:36,277 --> 00:04:38,477
It's "piss in."

115
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,612
And, louis, I don't want you
to slaughter jeffrey.

116
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:41,614
Why the hell not?

117
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:43,315
Because I want
harvey specter to.

118
00:04:43,317 --> 00:04:44,616
Come again?

119
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:45,916
You said he was
the best attorney in the city.

120
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:47,919
No, esther, I told you
he was my best friend.

121
00:04:47,921 --> 00:04:50,489
Which is exactly what you said
about jeremy henschell

122
00:04:50,491 --> 00:04:52,391
In tenth grade,
which really meant

123
00:04:52,393 --> 00:04:54,059
You worshipped him from afar,

124
00:04:54,061 --> 00:04:55,694
You wrote in your diary
about him,

125
00:04:55,696 --> 00:04:57,829
And you never actually hung out.

126
00:04:57,831 --> 00:04:59,598
Okay, you swore
you never read my diary.

127
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,767
And you swore you didn't spy
on me and jeremy.

128
00:05:01,769 --> 00:05:02,934
Oh, please, that was one time.

129
00:05:02,936 --> 00:05:04,536
I was on my way
to get a glass of milk,

130
00:05:04,538 --> 00:05:05,721
And for your information,

131
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:06,905
I've been lactose intolerant
ever since.

132
00:05:06,907 --> 00:05:08,473
Louis, are you gonna
get me harvey,

133
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:09,941
Or do I have to get him myself?

134
00:05:09,943 --> 00:05:13,312
Harvey is not taking on
any new clients right now,

135
00:05:13,314 --> 00:05:16,381
And he's out of town
for the next few years.

136
00:05:18,052 --> 00:05:21,053
Louis, I know what you're doing.

137
00:05:21,055 --> 00:05:23,021
You think I want harvey
because I don't think

138
00:05:23,023 --> 00:05:24,690
You're good enough.

139
00:05:24,692 --> 00:05:26,658
You're wrong.

140
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,794
I know how good you are,

141
00:05:28,796 --> 00:05:30,062
But this is personal for me,

142
00:05:30,064 --> 00:05:32,331
Which means
it will be personal for you,

143
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:35,934
And I can't have that.

144
00:05:35,936 --> 00:05:39,438
So please,
will you get me harvey?

145
00:05:40,741 --> 00:05:43,809
I'll make it happen.

146
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:47,946
Thank you, louis.

147
00:05:53,954 --> 00:05:55,620
That was esther?

148
00:05:55,622 --> 00:05:57,422
Yes, I know what you're gonna
say... we look exactly alike.

149
00:05:57,424 --> 00:05:58,540
That actually wasn't...

150
00:05:58,541 --> 00:05:59,657
I get it... it's like
looking at me in a wig.

151
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:00,792
I've heard it a thousand times.

152
00:06:00,794 --> 00:06:04,363
Yeah, the resemblance
is uncanny.

153
00:06:04,365 --> 00:06:05,948
What?

154
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:07,532
I'm just wondering why you're
not getting up to go ask harvey.

155
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:09,134
Because I'm not gonna ask him.

156
00:06:09,135 --> 00:06:10,735
I'm gonna save some time
and tell her he said no.

157
00:06:10,738 --> 00:06:12,371
Louis...

158
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:14,005
Donna, we all know
that harvey's furious at me.

159
00:06:14,007 --> 00:06:15,140
There's no way he's gonna do it.

160
00:06:15,142 --> 00:06:17,809
Maybe not.

161
00:06:17,811 --> 00:06:20,512
But, louis, she's family,

162
00:06:20,514 --> 00:06:23,582
And if there's one thing that
harvey understands, it's that.

163
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:27,652
Where the hell have you been?

164
00:06:27,654 --> 00:06:29,855
Sorry, I got stuck
in really bad traffic.

165
00:06:29,857 --> 00:06:32,157
So you were
in the wrong conference room.

166
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:34,659
For about 20 minutes.

167
00:06:34,661 --> 00:06:37,162
So what did we get?

168
00:06:37,164 --> 00:06:39,131
Want to take a guess?

169
00:06:39,133 --> 00:06:40,465
$90 million.

170
00:06:40,467 --> 00:06:42,567
Want to take a real guess?

171
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:43,602
That was a real guess.

172
00:06:43,604 --> 00:06:45,003
Son, what planet
are you living on?

173
00:06:45,005 --> 00:06:46,371
The planet where you called

174
00:06:46,372 --> 00:06:47,738
To say we got
a great settlement.

175
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:51,042
$25 million is
a great settlement.

176
00:06:51,044 --> 00:06:52,044
$25 million?

177
00:06:52,045 --> 00:06:53,912
Robert, after fees,

178
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:56,014
That's less than $70,000
per person.

179
00:06:56,016 --> 00:06:57,949
[laughs] then what do you
suggest we counter with?

180
00:06:57,951 --> 00:06:59,751
I suggest we counter
with a trial.

181
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:01,420
Are you nuts?
You don't go to trial.

182
00:07:01,422 --> 00:07:03,188
You turn up the pressure,
and then you settle.

183
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:05,524
Going to trial is
turning up the pressure.

184
00:07:05,526 --> 00:07:07,092
The second we finish
opening arguments,

185
00:07:07,094 --> 00:07:08,560
That offer is gonna triple.

186
00:07:08,562 --> 00:07:10,629
Look, I've sat across the table
from these two

187
00:07:10,631 --> 00:07:11,830
Four times
in the last six years,

188
00:07:11,832 --> 00:07:13,131
And when they say
this is their best offer,

189
00:07:13,133 --> 00:07:15,100
It's their best offer,
and we're recommending it.

190
00:07:15,102 --> 00:07:16,601
Well, you can recommend
whatever you want.

191
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:18,687
I'm recommending we reject it.

192
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:20,772
You don't give clients
conflicting opinions.

193
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:22,140
You work it out
behind closed doors.

194
00:07:22,142 --> 00:07:23,542
Well, maybe that's the problem.

195
00:07:23,543 --> 00:07:24,943
You want to do things
behind closed doors.

196
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:25,977
I actually want to be honest.

197
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:27,879
Hey, watch yourself, mike.

198
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,780
You tell me this,
would $70,000 per person

199
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:31,616
Be a great settlement
if we were talking

200
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:32,984
About laura's life or rachel's?

201
00:07:32,986 --> 00:07:34,553
You get out of here!

202
00:07:34,555 --> 00:07:36,105
You don't come back

203
00:07:36,106 --> 00:07:37,656
Until you wrap your head
around recommending this offer.

204
00:07:37,658 --> 00:07:39,958
And don't you ever
use them against me again!

215
00:08:23,103 --> 00:08:24,970
Don't tell me
he wasn't in here either.

216
00:08:24,972 --> 00:08:26,605
He was in here, all right.

217
00:08:26,607 --> 00:08:29,107
What happened?
Did the settlement fall through?

218
00:08:29,109 --> 00:08:32,010
No, it didn't, but it should've.

219
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:34,746
They gave us a shitty offer.
Robert's ready to take it.

220
00:08:34,748 --> 00:08:37,716
Come on, if it's really
that bad, why would he take it?

221
00:08:37,718 --> 00:08:39,684
Because he knows his clients
will jump all over it

222
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:41,086
And it's the easy way out.

223
00:08:41,088 --> 00:08:43,221
So you think robert doesn't care
about his clients?

224
00:08:43,223 --> 00:08:44,956
It sure seems that way.

225
00:08:44,957 --> 00:08:46,690
Mike, I've only been here
a few months,

226
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:50,228
And there are a lot of things
you can say about robert zane,

227
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:53,532
But what you can't say
is that he doesn't care

228
00:08:53,534 --> 00:08:54,966
About his clients.

229
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:01,806
Go away, louis.

230
00:09:01,808 --> 00:09:03,074
I would, but then
I couldn't tell you

231
00:09:03,076 --> 00:09:05,210
About the $50-million company
I'm giving you.

232
00:09:05,212 --> 00:09:07,195
And why would you do that?

233
00:09:07,196 --> 00:09:09,179
'Cause I want to make up
for our little misunderstanding.

234
00:09:09,182 --> 00:09:11,182
We didn't have
a misunderstanding.

235
00:09:11,183 --> 00:09:13,183
You went after my money,
so if you're giving me a client,

236
00:09:13,186 --> 00:09:14,753
There's some other
misunderstanding

237
00:09:14,755 --> 00:09:16,755
That you're too chickenshit
to tell me about.

238
00:09:19,293 --> 00:09:21,826
It's my sister's company.

239
00:09:21,828 --> 00:09:23,562
I'll give you her business.

240
00:09:23,564 --> 00:09:25,230
All you have to do
is handle her divorce.

241
00:09:25,232 --> 00:09:26,831
I don't want
your sister's business.

242
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:27,933
Now get out.

243
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:34,306
Harvey, this is my family.

244
00:09:34,308 --> 00:09:38,643
My sister, she... Has never
asked me for anything

245
00:09:38,645 --> 00:09:40,946
Her entire life, not once.

246
00:09:40,948 --> 00:09:45,250
Now the one time she does,
I just can't let her down.

247
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,920
Louis, I'm not
a divorce attorney.

248
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:50,589
When has a shitty detail
like that

249
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:52,657
Ever stopped you before?

250
00:09:56,029 --> 00:09:58,263
All right, I'll do it,
on two conditions.

251
00:09:58,265 --> 00:10:01,600
First, you stay completely
out of this case.

252
00:10:01,602 --> 00:10:03,168
Done. Second?

253
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:05,370
I'll let you know
when I think of it.

254
00:10:05,372 --> 00:10:07,372
How do I know it won't be
something I can't stomach?

255
00:10:07,374 --> 00:10:10,742
You don't, but those are
my two conditions.

256
00:10:10,744 --> 00:10:14,746
Okay, harvey, you have a deal.

257
00:10:14,748 --> 00:10:17,649
One thing.

258
00:10:17,651 --> 00:10:20,085
Promise me you won't
sleep with esther.

259
00:10:20,087 --> 00:10:22,887
Believe me, louis,
the last thing I want to do

260
00:10:22,889 --> 00:10:25,957
Is sleep with your sister.

261
00:10:27,728 --> 00:10:29,394
(robert) I'm glad you agree.

262
00:10:29,396 --> 00:10:32,664
I'll let you know
when the paperwork's finished.

263
00:10:36,036 --> 00:10:37,802
I know you didn't wrap your head
around this deal

264
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:39,671
In the last ten minutes,

265
00:10:39,673 --> 00:10:41,072
So what are you still
doing in my office?

266
00:10:41,074 --> 00:10:43,174
Exactly what you'd be doing
in my place.

267
00:10:43,176 --> 00:10:45,710
Robert, I know you said
that you know these two lawyers,

268
00:10:45,712 --> 00:10:47,145
But I don't.

269
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:49,681
I need to see for myself
what they will or won't do.

270
00:10:49,683 --> 00:10:50,982
And you still want to counter.

271
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:52,217
I want to at least try.

272
00:10:52,219 --> 00:10:53,918
Except you don't want to go
by yourself,

273
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:54,953
You want me to go with you.

274
00:10:54,955 --> 00:10:56,988
Yes, I do.

275
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,790
Because you and I both know,
if we don't go together,

276
00:10:58,792 --> 00:11:00,025
We don't stand a chance.

277
00:11:00,027 --> 00:11:03,895
I know we don't stand a chance
either way.

278
00:11:03,897 --> 00:11:06,131
And if I do go, it makes me
look like a fool.

279
00:11:06,133 --> 00:11:10,969
Robert, I saved you from looking
like a fool in that courtroom.

280
00:11:10,971 --> 00:11:13,438
I came through for you.

281
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,341
Now I'm asking you
to come through for me on this.

282
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:19,010
You and rachel are
peas in a pod.

283
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:21,379
[chuckles]

284
00:11:21,381 --> 00:11:23,281
Can't believe she's really
worth $50 million.

285
00:11:23,283 --> 00:11:25,350
I can't believe you've never
heard of her company.

286
00:11:25,352 --> 00:11:27,852
Do I look like I buy
a lot of potholders?

287
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:29,120
She doesn't just sell
potholders.

288
00:11:29,122 --> 00:11:31,256
She has a brand
like martha stewart.

289
00:11:31,258 --> 00:11:33,258
Look, I get that you think
she's impressive,

290
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:35,794
But to me,
she's just louis's sister,

291
00:11:35,796 --> 00:11:38,029
Which, as far as I'm concerned,
is strike number two.

292
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:39,164
What's strike number one?

293
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:40,832
The fact that
she's louis's sister.

294
00:11:40,834 --> 00:11:42,834
Oh, come on, harvey, listen.

295
00:11:42,836 --> 00:11:45,103
Are you gonna take this
seriously or not?

296
00:11:45,105 --> 00:11:46,137
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.

297
00:11:46,139 --> 00:11:47,305
I'm gonna go walk there.

298
00:11:47,307 --> 00:11:49,624
I'm gonna shake
this woman's meaty hand.

299
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:51,942
I'm gonna get this over with
as quickly as possible.

300
00:11:55,916 --> 00:11:56,916
You?

301
00:11:56,917 --> 00:11:58,450
You've got to be kidding me.

302
00:11:58,452 --> 00:12:00,151
You two know each other?

303
00:12:00,153 --> 00:12:01,853
So you weren't meeting
the governor.

304
00:12:01,855 --> 00:12:03,955
You're telling me you were
really gonna blow off the mayor?

305
00:12:03,957 --> 00:12:06,157
The mayor.
You don't know the mayor.

306
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:10,128
I'm so sorry, let me introduce
my soon-to-be former associate.

307
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:11,396
[chuckles] rachel zane.

308
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:14,866
Esther edelstein.

309
00:12:14,868 --> 00:12:16,935
It's nice to finally
meet the man

310
00:12:16,937 --> 00:12:18,303
I've heard
such good things about.

311
00:12:18,305 --> 00:12:20,706
It's nice to meet the woman

312
00:12:20,707 --> 00:12:23,108
I've obviously heard
nothing but lies about.

313
00:12:25,979 --> 00:12:27,512
Let's get to it.

314
00:12:27,514 --> 00:12:28,780
Yes.

315
00:12:28,782 --> 00:12:31,049
I just have to know,

316
00:12:31,051 --> 00:12:33,785
Were one of the two of you
adopted?

317
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:38,022
I've been asking that for years.

318
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:40,959
Hey. Get out.

319
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:50,235
Shit.

320
00:12:50,237 --> 00:12:52,804
Come on, speak up, narcissist,
it's not a freakin' library.

321
00:12:55,242 --> 00:12:56,808
Reminder to thin the walls

322
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:59,010
In the conference room/
make a peephole.

323
00:12:59,012 --> 00:13:00,078
What do you think you're doing?

324
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,146
What happened?

325
00:13:01,147 --> 00:13:02,213
Oh, I was just checking
the sound-proofing,

326
00:13:02,214 --> 00:13:03,280
Making sure
they thicken the walls

327
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:04,783
In the conference room.

328
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:06,284
So if I walk out this door
and I turn to the right,

329
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:08,153
I won't see harvey
in there with esther?

330
00:13:08,155 --> 00:13:09,420
Esther's here?
I didn't know that.

331
00:13:09,422 --> 00:13:11,156
Louis, listening
through the wall

332
00:13:11,158 --> 00:13:12,423
Is not staying out of her case,

333
00:13:12,425 --> 00:13:14,425
And if harvey finds out,
he's gonna drop her.

334
00:13:14,427 --> 00:13:16,828
Look, it's my sister, all right?

335
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:18,363
I just want to make sure
he does right by her.

336
00:13:18,365 --> 00:13:20,498
And you never would have
asked him to take this case

337
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,567
If you didn't trust
that he would do just that.

338
00:13:22,569 --> 00:13:25,870
So put the glass down,
go back to your office,

339
00:13:25,872 --> 00:13:27,939
And let him do his job.

340
00:13:29,943 --> 00:13:31,142
You know it'd be easier
for both of us

341
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:33,211
If you were wrong
every once in a while.

342
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:39,017
When we decided to get divorced,
jeffrey and I agreed

343
00:13:39,019 --> 00:13:42,554
He would get 20% of the company,
no need to involve lawyers.

344
00:13:42,556 --> 00:13:46,157
The next thing I knew,
I got a letter from a lawyer.

345
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:48,393
Jeffrey doesn't think
20% is enough anymore.

346
00:13:48,395 --> 00:13:51,129
No, he doesn't.

347
00:13:51,131 --> 00:13:52,430
Esther, I'm gonna ask you
a question,

348
00:13:52,432 --> 00:13:54,499
And I want you
to answer me honestly.

349
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:57,068
Who's leaving who?

350
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:58,136
It's mutual.

351
00:13:58,138 --> 00:13:59,571
It's never mutual.

352
00:13:59,573 --> 00:14:02,874
So I'm gonna ask you again.
Who's driving this decision?

353
00:14:04,611 --> 00:14:05,611
I am.

354
00:14:05,612 --> 00:14:07,078
Then the answer to our problem

355
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,047
Is for you to stay away
from the negotiations.

356
00:14:09,049 --> 00:14:12,050
What? No, I'm not staying away.

357
00:14:12,052 --> 00:14:13,052
Listen to me.

358
00:14:13,053 --> 00:14:14,285
He's going back on your deal

359
00:14:14,287 --> 00:14:15,854
Because he wants
to prolong the fight.

360
00:14:15,856 --> 00:14:17,205
I don't care.

361
00:14:17,206 --> 00:14:18,555
I spent 12 years
building the company.

362
00:14:18,558 --> 00:14:20,425
I'm not gonna sit back
and let someone else decide

363
00:14:20,427 --> 00:14:21,926
How much I'm allowed to keep.

364
00:14:21,928 --> 00:14:23,094
Then what'd you come to me for?

365
00:14:23,096 --> 00:14:25,029
Because you're supposed to be
the best.

366
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:26,965
I am the best,
and I didn't get that way

367
00:14:26,967 --> 00:14:28,600
Letting someone else
call the shots.

368
00:14:28,602 --> 00:14:30,368
So you're either gonna
let me do that,

369
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:33,104
Or you're gonna get yourself
another lawyer.

370
00:14:37,644 --> 00:14:38,924
.

371
00:14:38,925 --> 00:14:40,205
All right, here's what
I need you to do.

372
00:14:40,206 --> 00:14:41,486
You can tell me what you
need me to do in a minute.

373
00:14:41,487 --> 00:14:42,767
First we're gonna talk
about what happened back there.

374
00:14:42,768 --> 00:14:44,048
What happened is,
I laid down the law,

375
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:45,583
She accepted, I'm the man.

376
00:14:45,585 --> 00:14:46,918
Yep, uh-huh.

377
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,453
Okay, I'm not talking
about that.

378
00:14:48,455 --> 00:14:50,288
I'm talking about how the moment
you walked through the door,

379
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:51,956
You looked like you were struck
by a bolt of lighting.

380
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:53,424
- I did not.
- You most certainly did.

381
00:14:53,426 --> 00:14:55,393
In fact,
before you started fighting,

382
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:57,328
I was afraid the two of you were
gonna go at it on the table.

383
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:58,330
Afraid or hoping?

384
00:14:58,331 --> 00:14:59,948
That's unsavory.

385
00:14:59,949 --> 00:15:01,566
And you making lewd comments
about our client isn't?

386
00:15:01,568 --> 00:15:03,501
Lewd comments about what client?

387
00:15:03,503 --> 00:15:05,203
Harvey likes louis's sister.

388
00:15:05,205 --> 00:15:07,405
That's funny, 'cause that's
exactly what I came in here

389
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:08,407
To talk to him about.

390
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:10,174
You like louis's sister?

391
00:15:10,176 --> 00:15:11,476
Not enough to fight you for her.

392
00:15:11,478 --> 00:15:13,511
Well, you should reconsider.
She's lovely.

393
00:15:16,216 --> 00:15:19,017
And I'm leaving.

394
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:23,488
Harvey, why are you
all of a sudden

395
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:25,423
Taking on esther edelstein
as a client?

396
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:27,992
And don't tell me
it's because she's lovely,

397
00:15:27,994 --> 00:15:29,594
Because I'm not sure
I believe that.

398
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:31,496
I took her on
because louis asked me to.

399
00:15:31,498 --> 00:15:34,265
And the last I heard, you and I
were both pissed at him.

400
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:36,167
And I still am.

401
00:15:36,169 --> 00:15:37,535
But he told me this was family,

402
00:15:37,537 --> 00:15:40,305
And... I thought
this might be a chance

403
00:15:40,307 --> 00:15:42,340
For us all to get back on track.

404
00:15:42,342 --> 00:15:44,075
I like that, harvey.

405
00:15:44,077 --> 00:15:46,161
You just might turn out

406
00:15:46,162 --> 00:15:48,246
To be a half decent name partner
after all.

407
00:15:49,582 --> 00:15:50,582
I doubt it.

408
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:52,617
So do i.

409
00:15:54,421 --> 00:15:56,187
Well, frankly, robert,
I'm surprised

410
00:15:56,189 --> 00:15:57,288
You called for another meeting.

411
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:59,157
Surprised by a routine counter?

412
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:02,293
When the first offer is
as generous as ours, I am.

413
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:05,096
Just hear the man out, will.

414
00:16:05,098 --> 00:16:08,166
Campbell v. State health.
Wilson v. Genrx.

415
00:16:08,168 --> 00:16:10,301
Friedman v. Medfirst.

416
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:11,602
Those are
identical class actions

417
00:16:11,604 --> 00:16:12,603
In which the average payout

418
00:16:12,605 --> 00:16:14,372
Was $1/2 million per plaintiff.

419
00:16:14,374 --> 00:16:16,607
They were jury awards,
and two of them were reduced

420
00:16:16,609 --> 00:16:18,209
For being excessively punitive.

421
00:16:18,211 --> 00:16:20,311
Dollar amount was still higher
than what's on the table.

422
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:22,147
After seven years of appeals.

423
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:23,982
Yeah, and like we said,
we don't care how long it takes.

424
00:16:23,984 --> 00:16:25,717
We want triple
what you're offering.

425
00:16:25,719 --> 00:16:28,219
And I want to skinny dip
with sofia vergara,

426
00:16:28,221 --> 00:16:30,188
But<i> no puedo hacerlo.</i>

427
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:32,590
That's spanish for "we're not
giving you another nickel."

428
00:16:32,592 --> 00:16:34,993
And what's spanish
for "we'll see you in court"?

429
00:16:34,995 --> 00:16:36,027
Bring it on.

430
00:16:36,029 --> 00:16:37,061
That's enough. Come on, will.

431
00:16:37,063 --> 00:16:38,196
We're just having
a conversation.

432
00:16:38,198 --> 00:16:39,464
Conversation?

433
00:16:39,466 --> 00:16:41,132
I gave you a fair offer, robert,

434
00:16:41,134 --> 00:16:42,667
Because I respect you,

435
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:44,569
And I thought that
you respected me enough to know

436
00:16:44,571 --> 00:16:47,138
That I meant it when I said
it's the best I could do.

437
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:49,340
Then he comes in here
threatening a trial.

438
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:50,475
Well, you know what?

439
00:16:50,477 --> 00:16:52,343
You don't like
what's on the table,

440
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:55,113
We can pull
the whole damn thing.

441
00:16:58,418 --> 00:16:59,684
I told you
he wasn't messing around.

442
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:01,019
You were right about that.

443
00:17:01,021 --> 00:17:02,453
Now I'm right
about taking this to trial.

444
00:17:02,455 --> 00:17:04,188
You aren't right about anything.

445
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:05,723
I owed you. I paid up.
We're done.

446
00:17:05,725 --> 00:17:07,058
No, we're not done,
and I'm still not

447
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:08,593
Recommending this offer
to my clients.

448
00:17:08,595 --> 00:17:11,696
Well, that's too bad,
because they already signed off.

449
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:14,766
What?

450
00:17:14,768 --> 00:17:17,235
You talked to our clients
before we even went in there?

451
00:17:17,237 --> 00:17:18,503
You're damn right I did.

452
00:17:18,505 --> 00:17:20,471
We took a shot,
and it didn't work.

453
00:17:20,473 --> 00:17:22,073
Now, in the meantime,
we had an obligation

454
00:17:22,075 --> 00:17:23,741
To show their offer
to our clients, and I did.

455
00:17:23,743 --> 00:17:25,610
Don't give me
some bullshit justification.

456
00:17:25,612 --> 00:17:27,178
You went behind my back.

457
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:30,048
I didn't go behind your back.
I went over your head.

458
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:31,616
What the hell
are you talking about?

459
00:17:31,618 --> 00:17:33,218
You know what the hell
I'm talking about.

460
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:36,387
I went to your boss's boss,
and you know what?

461
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:38,189
She and I see things
the same way.

462
00:17:38,191 --> 00:17:40,425
And as far as I'm concerned,
this case is settled.

463
00:17:46,266 --> 00:17:49,400
Why don't you two have a seat?
I suggest we get right to it.

464
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:50,835
Wait a second, where's esther?

465
00:17:50,837 --> 00:17:53,104
She won't be joining us,
but I've been authorized

466
00:17:53,106 --> 00:17:55,690
To negotiate on her behalf.

467
00:17:55,691 --> 00:17:58,275
No. No, I'm not agreeing
to anything without her here.

468
00:17:58,278 --> 00:18:00,244
That's because you don't really
want to negotiate,

469
00:18:00,246 --> 00:18:01,546
You just want to stay
connected to her,

470
00:18:01,548 --> 00:18:03,365
And that's not gonna happen.

471
00:18:03,366 --> 00:18:05,183
I don't know when you decided
to become a divorce attorney,

472
00:18:05,185 --> 00:18:06,617
But that's not how it works.

473
00:18:06,619 --> 00:18:08,086
I didn't become
a divorce attorney

474
00:18:08,088 --> 00:18:09,420
Because it's the minor leagues,

475
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:12,290
But this is how it works
with me.

476
00:18:13,626 --> 00:18:14,626
What the hell is this?

477
00:18:14,627 --> 00:18:16,461
That's our new offer, nothing.

478
00:18:16,463 --> 00:18:17,896
This is bullshit.

479
00:18:17,897 --> 00:18:19,330
You thinking
you deserve even 20%

480
00:18:19,332 --> 00:18:21,332
Of our client's business
is bullshit.

481
00:18:21,334 --> 00:18:23,568
So you're either gonna
accept the terms

482
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:25,803
That you and esther agreed to,
or you can take our new offer.

483
00:18:25,805 --> 00:18:28,306
You can threaten all you want,
but my client has a right

484
00:18:28,308 --> 00:18:31,175
To what's his,
and that's half the company,

485
00:18:31,177 --> 00:18:34,345
Because 12 years ago, that's
what your client agreed to.

486
00:18:34,347 --> 00:18:36,647
See, I wasn't just gonna be
esther's husband.

487
00:18:36,649 --> 00:18:39,851
I was gonna be a doctor,
but I put that on hold

488
00:18:39,853 --> 00:18:41,786
While esther got her company
off the ground,

489
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:44,455
And when I said
I was willing to do that,

490
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:46,441
She said I'd get half.

491
00:18:46,442 --> 00:18:48,426
Which constitutes
an enforceable verbal contract.

492
00:18:48,428 --> 00:18:50,795
(jeffrey) so I don't care
whether esther's here or not.

493
00:18:50,797 --> 00:18:52,230
She promised to spend
our lives together,

494
00:18:52,232 --> 00:18:54,665
And she's breaking that promise.

495
00:18:54,667 --> 00:18:56,467
There's nothing I can do
about that one,

496
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:58,436
But I'm sure as hell gonna
hold her to the other one.

497
00:18:58,438 --> 00:19:00,638
You have no proof
she ever made that promise.

498
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,707
Ask your client about it,
because when we depose her

499
00:19:02,709 --> 00:19:05,543
Under oath,
you can rest assured we will.

500
00:19:19,826 --> 00:19:20,224
.

501
00:19:20,226 --> 00:19:21,726
You authorized the settlement?

502
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:23,227
You want to change that tone?

503
00:19:23,229 --> 00:19:24,462
No, I don't, because you told

504
00:19:24,464 --> 00:19:25,830
Robert zane to treat me
like a partner,

505
00:19:25,832 --> 00:19:27,665
And then you turned around,
and you cut my legs out.

506
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:29,534
I told him that
because you were my proxy,

507
00:19:29,536 --> 00:19:31,569
But you're not my proxy with me.

508
00:19:31,571 --> 00:19:34,438
And I don't appreciate
my decisions being questioned.

509
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,390
Did you even look at that offer?

510
00:19:36,391 --> 00:19:38,341
Mike, I'm going to explain
something to you that,

511
00:19:38,344 --> 00:19:39,944
Based on your approach
to this conversation,

512
00:19:39,946 --> 00:19:41,879
You clearly don't understand.

513
00:19:41,881 --> 00:19:43,481
This trial will cost millions.

514
00:19:43,483 --> 00:19:45,183
And arcadian has deep pockets.

515
00:19:45,185 --> 00:19:47,451
And they're not looking
to empty them on a gamble.

516
00:19:47,453 --> 00:19:48,886
So this is all
just about the money.

517
00:19:48,888 --> 00:19:51,489
Were you born yesterday?

518
00:19:51,491 --> 00:19:53,257
The clients are looking
for money.

519
00:19:53,259 --> 00:19:55,777
We're looking for money.

520
00:19:55,778 --> 00:19:58,296
The insurance company's
looking to keep money.

521
00:19:58,298 --> 00:20:00,482
It's always about the money.

522
00:20:00,483 --> 00:20:02,667
And if you had some balls,
we'd get a whole lot more.

523
00:20:05,772 --> 00:20:08,206
Listen to me,
I don't know what you thought

524
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:11,242
Marching in here was going to do
other than piss me off,

525
00:20:11,244 --> 00:20:13,344
But you're going to march
the hell back out

526
00:20:13,346 --> 00:20:16,447
Because I have better things
to do with my time

527
00:20:16,449 --> 00:20:20,251
Than to explain to you
how the world works.

528
00:20:22,455 --> 00:20:23,688
[scoffs]

529
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:26,324
Hey, I got your message.

530
00:20:26,326 --> 00:20:28,226
Jeffrey signed the agreement?

531
00:20:28,228 --> 00:20:29,627
He did.

532
00:20:29,629 --> 00:20:32,296
All it needs
is your john hancock.

533
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:40,571
Wait, this doesn't say 20%.
It says 50%.

534
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:43,507
Oh, I'm sorry,
did I forget to mention

535
00:20:43,509 --> 00:20:46,010
That he said you promised him
50% of your company

536
00:20:46,012 --> 00:20:47,411
For putting off medical school?

537
00:20:47,413 --> 00:20:51,515
Because you sure forgot
to mention that to me.

538
00:20:51,517 --> 00:20:52,850
[laughs]

539
00:20:52,852 --> 00:20:54,285
You have got to be kidding me.

540
00:20:54,287 --> 00:20:55,770
How could you not tell me that?

541
00:20:55,771 --> 00:20:57,254
Because it was
a throwaway conversation

542
00:20:57,257 --> 00:20:59,423
We had 12 years ago
on the new jersey turnpike.

543
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:01,525
Well, it wasn't throwaway
to him, and he's gonna use it

544
00:21:01,527 --> 00:21:02,827
Because he's feeling betrayed.

545
00:21:02,829 --> 00:21:04,362
Well, I don't really care
what he's feeling

546
00:21:04,364 --> 00:21:06,797
Because he's the one
who had the affair.

547
00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:11,702
You wanted to know the
circumstances of our divorce.

548
00:21:11,704 --> 00:21:13,604
Well, that's what they are.

549
00:21:13,606 --> 00:21:15,406
That's why I'm leaving him.

550
00:21:15,408 --> 00:21:17,642
I am sure you wouldn't
understand what's it like

551
00:21:17,644 --> 00:21:21,045
To experience infidelity.

552
00:21:21,047 --> 00:21:23,614
I would, and I do,

553
00:21:23,616 --> 00:21:25,850
But that doesn't change the fact
that you made a contract.

554
00:21:25,852 --> 00:21:28,319
What about our other contract?
20%.

555
00:21:28,321 --> 00:21:30,554
The original agreement
supersedes it,

556
00:21:30,556 --> 00:21:33,491
And an affair
doesn't change that.

557
00:21:33,493 --> 00:21:35,626
Except he doesn't have any proof

558
00:21:35,628 --> 00:21:37,561
I ever made
the original agreement.

559
00:21:37,563 --> 00:21:39,463
Esther, they're gonna
put you under oath

560
00:21:39,465 --> 00:21:42,466
And ask you point-blank
if this happened.

561
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:44,335
And I'm going to say it didn't.

562
00:21:44,337 --> 00:21:46,037
That's perjury, and I'm not
gonna let you do that.

563
00:21:46,039 --> 00:21:47,571
What are you, some white knight

564
00:21:47,573 --> 00:21:49,073
Who never crosses the line
to win?

565
00:21:49,075 --> 00:21:50,975
No, but I'm not gonna let you
make a decision

566
00:21:50,977 --> 00:21:52,766
In the heat of the moment

567
00:21:52,767 --> 00:21:54,556
That you'll regret
for the rest of your life.

568
00:21:54,557 --> 00:21:56,346
Well, then you better find some
other way to void this deal,

569
00:21:56,349 --> 00:21:59,016
Because there's no way
I'm giving my shit bag husband

570
00:21:59,018 --> 00:22:01,886
Half of everything I own.

571
00:22:05,758 --> 00:22:07,692
I need you to find
every loophole there is

572
00:22:07,694 --> 00:22:09,927
Around verbal contracts.

573
00:22:09,929 --> 00:22:11,462
So jeffrey was
telling the truth?

574
00:22:11,464 --> 00:22:13,431
Yes, and she'd rather
slit her wrists

575
00:22:13,433 --> 00:22:15,399
Than give him 50%,
and I don't blame her.

576
00:22:15,401 --> 00:22:17,468
Yeah, but she's the one
who's leaving him, so...

577
00:22:19,972 --> 00:22:21,939
He cheated on her, didn't he?

578
00:22:21,941 --> 00:22:25,509
Well, that's between our client
and her soon-to-be ex-husband,

579
00:22:25,511 --> 00:22:26,811
And I have no intention
of letting him

580
00:22:26,813 --> 00:22:28,879
Get the better of her.

581
00:22:29,982 --> 00:22:31,515
What?

582
00:22:31,517 --> 00:22:34,785
You're being protective.
It's sweet.

583
00:22:34,787 --> 00:22:36,520
Okay, listen to me,
we're protecting esther

584
00:22:36,522 --> 00:22:38,889
Because it's our job
to protect her.

585
00:22:38,891 --> 00:22:40,791
And if we don't figure
a way out of this,

586
00:22:40,793 --> 00:22:42,626
She's gonna lose
millions of dollars,

587
00:22:42,628 --> 00:22:44,962
So you want to make observations
about the two of us,

588
00:22:44,964 --> 00:22:47,798
Do it all you want
after we've won.

589
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,867
I'm on it.

590
00:22:53,106 --> 00:22:57,775
Okay, so final deal memos here,
check authorizations here.

591
00:22:57,777 --> 00:23:02,747
Now all we need to do is get
kelton to sign, and we are done.

592
00:23:05,051 --> 00:23:07,785
Mike, I know you think
this deal sucks,

593
00:23:07,787 --> 00:23:10,488
But there is a silver lining.

594
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:12,556
We got to work together again.

595
00:23:13,993 --> 00:23:15,526
What?

596
00:23:15,528 --> 00:23:17,528
I was just thinking
about when we started.

597
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:19,029
Who would've thought that
working with you

598
00:23:19,031 --> 00:23:21,799
Would ever have been
a silver lining?

599
00:23:21,801 --> 00:23:23,033
Me?

600
00:23:23,035 --> 00:23:24,068
[laughs] yeah, you.

601
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:25,403
What about you?

602
00:23:25,405 --> 00:23:26,604
What are you talking about?

603
00:23:26,606 --> 00:23:28,639
I have been a gentleman
since day one.

604
00:23:28,641 --> 00:23:29,940
- Really?
- Yes.

605
00:23:29,942 --> 00:23:31,575
Remember the whole
airplane incident?

606
00:23:31,577 --> 00:23:34,645
Do I?
Yes, you were the one who...

607
00:23:36,549 --> 00:23:38,949
Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

608
00:23:38,951 --> 00:23:40,551
Wait a second. Delta financial.

609
00:23:40,553 --> 00:23:41,769
What about them?

610
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:42,986
There was a brochure
for delta bauer financial

611
00:23:42,989 --> 00:23:44,789
On robert zane's desk.

612
00:23:44,791 --> 00:23:46,090
And on top of that,
they were listed

613
00:23:46,092 --> 00:23:48,759
As a subsidiary
on arcadian's annual report.

614
00:23:48,761 --> 00:23:50,594
As are 50 other funds.

615
00:23:50,596 --> 00:23:54,198
50 other funds that don't have a
brochure on robert zane's desk.

616
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,633
Mike...

617
00:23:55,634 --> 00:23:57,067
Katrina, I need to know
if they're one of your clients.

618
00:23:57,069 --> 00:23:58,169
You know I can't tell you that.

619
00:23:58,171 --> 00:23:59,687
Okay, well, you just did.

620
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:01,204
Now I need to know
if they own shares of kelton.

621
00:24:01,207 --> 00:24:03,607
I don't know if they own shares,
and I'm not gonna find out.

622
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:06,010
You don't care if robert zane
is manipulating a case

623
00:24:06,012 --> 00:24:07,044
To service a hedge fund?

624
00:24:07,046 --> 00:24:08,546
It doesn't matter if I care.

625
00:24:08,548 --> 00:24:09,847
I can't violate
attorney-client privilege.

626
00:24:09,849 --> 00:24:11,482
You said you owe me.

627
00:24:11,484 --> 00:24:13,217
And you said I owe rachel.

628
00:24:13,219 --> 00:24:15,553
Katrina, please.

629
00:24:15,555 --> 00:24:17,688
You said that robert is
doing right by his clients.

630
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:19,690
Well, I just need to know
which clients

631
00:24:19,692 --> 00:24:21,692
He's doing right by.

632
00:24:23,696 --> 00:24:25,463
[sighs]

633
00:24:29,602 --> 00:24:32,803
Hey. Do you have a minute?

634
00:24:32,805 --> 00:24:35,940
The last time I asked you that,
you told me the answer was no.

635
00:24:35,942 --> 00:24:37,741
And I still gave you the minute.

636
00:24:37,743 --> 00:24:39,243
Well, I happen to be
in the middle

637
00:24:39,245 --> 00:24:41,479
Of trying to get louis's sister
out of a huge mess, so...

638
00:24:41,481 --> 00:24:42,913
That's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

639
00:24:42,915 --> 00:24:44,849
Louis promised
to stay out of this.

640
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:46,784
And he is, and I'm not here
because he asked me to be.

641
00:24:46,786 --> 00:24:48,085
I'm here because I care
about him and...

642
00:24:48,087 --> 00:24:50,154
That's not my problem.

643
00:24:50,156 --> 00:24:52,556
Harvey, I'm not the enemy here.

644
00:24:52,558 --> 00:24:54,692
And louis is your partner
and your friend,

645
00:24:54,694 --> 00:24:56,494
And right now, he needs
a little reassurance.

646
00:24:56,496 --> 00:24:58,095
And I told you before,
I'm not the guy

647
00:24:58,097 --> 00:24:59,897
That gives you a hug
when you're scared.

648
00:24:59,899 --> 00:25:01,799
I'm the guy that wins
when you need it the most.

649
00:25:01,801 --> 00:25:03,167
Why can't you for once...

650
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:04,534
You know what, donna,
when I came to you for help,

651
00:25:04,537 --> 00:25:06,170
You said that I don't
get to do that anymore.

652
00:25:06,172 --> 00:25:07,838
Well, you don't get
to do this anymore.

653
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:11,509
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have work to do.

654
00:25:12,912 --> 00:25:14,912
You know what, harvey?

655
00:25:14,914 --> 00:25:16,847
Louis was afraid to let you
take this case,

656
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:19,083
And I told him not to be
because I trusted

657
00:25:19,085 --> 00:25:20,684
That at the end of the day,

658
00:25:20,686 --> 00:25:23,120
You'd remember
that we're family.

659
00:25:23,122 --> 00:25:25,523
But maybe I was wrong.

660
00:25:25,525 --> 00:25:27,992
Because I spent 12 years
putting you first,

661
00:25:27,994 --> 00:25:31,228
And the day I finally decided
to do something for myself,

662
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:33,964
You didn't just stop
treating me like family,

663
00:25:33,966 --> 00:25:36,967
You started treating me
like a stranger.

664
00:25:36,969 --> 00:25:39,837
And for your information,
that is a thousand times worse

665
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:43,173
Than if you treated me
like your enemy.

666
00:25:57,290 --> 00:25:58,956
Louis, did you need something?

667
00:25:58,958 --> 00:26:01,559
I need you to know
how proud I am of you,

668
00:26:01,561 --> 00:26:03,193
'cause seeing you working
like this

669
00:26:03,195 --> 00:26:05,930
Just reminds me how
you persevered with the lsats

670
00:26:05,932 --> 00:26:08,299
And how you got into law school,
and now...

671
00:26:08,301 --> 00:26:09,767
Louis, I'm not telling you
about esther's case.

672
00:26:09,769 --> 00:26:12,770
Well, then what the hell
good are you?

673
00:26:12,772 --> 00:26:15,739
Louis, you promised harvey
you would stay out of it.

674
00:26:15,741 --> 00:26:17,007
I just need to know
what happened.

675
00:26:17,009 --> 00:26:18,009
What happened with what?

676
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:19,310
What happened with them.

677
00:26:19,312 --> 00:26:21,111
I mean, it's no secret
that I hated jeffrey,

678
00:26:21,113 --> 00:26:24,982
But esther, she loved him,

679
00:26:24,984 --> 00:26:28,118
And for them to just...

680
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:30,654
I need to know why.

681
00:26:32,825 --> 00:26:35,593
He cheated on her.

682
00:26:42,335 --> 00:26:45,636
Well, then you promise me
that the two of you...

683
00:26:45,638 --> 00:26:47,705
Stick it to that sack of shit.

684
00:26:47,707 --> 00:26:50,841
What do you think
I'm working on?

685
00:27:02,922 --> 00:27:03,120
.

686
00:27:03,122 --> 00:27:05,122
We're all squared away
on the paperwork?

687
00:27:05,124 --> 00:27:06,374
No, we're not squared away
on shit

688
00:27:06,375 --> 00:27:07,625
Until you tell me
whether or not you knew.

689
00:27:07,627 --> 00:27:08,993
You want to run that
by me again?

690
00:27:08,995 --> 00:27:10,961
Delta financial, your client.

691
00:27:10,963 --> 00:27:12,930
Did you know they were
heavily invested in kelton?

692
00:27:12,932 --> 00:27:14,398
Are you accusing me
of something, mike?

693
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,000
Because you better watch
what you say.

694
00:27:16,002 --> 00:27:17,234
You still haven't answered
my question.

695
00:27:17,236 --> 00:27:19,103
Did you know a subsidiary
of the hedge fund

696
00:27:19,105 --> 00:27:22,373
Backing our suit just purchased
a huge block of kelton shares?

697
00:27:22,375 --> 00:27:24,942
I am their lawyer,
not a stock analyst.

698
00:27:24,944 --> 00:27:27,711
Then maybe you can
explain to me why you have

699
00:27:27,713 --> 00:27:29,980
One of their brochures
on your desk?

700
00:27:29,982 --> 00:27:33,717
Okay, listen to me,
mr. Photographic memory.

701
00:27:33,719 --> 00:27:36,720
Underneath this brochure
are another 35

702
00:27:36,722 --> 00:27:38,422
That have been piling up there
for a year and a half

703
00:27:38,424 --> 00:27:39,807
Because I'm looking
to invest my money

704
00:27:39,808 --> 00:27:41,191
That someday may be going
to your children.

705
00:27:41,193 --> 00:27:43,293
Wait, you think we want money
that comes from some stock

706
00:27:43,295 --> 00:27:44,862
That went through the roof
because you authorized

707
00:27:44,864 --> 00:27:46,730
A settlement
lower than street expectations?

708
00:27:46,732 --> 00:27:49,266
Okay, you've said your piece.
Now I'm gonna say mine.

709
00:27:49,268 --> 00:27:52,336
I have been a lawyer
and an officer of the court

710
00:27:52,338 --> 00:27:55,706
Longer than you've breathed air,

711
00:27:55,708 --> 00:27:56,874
And I'm looking you
straight in the eye

712
00:27:56,876 --> 00:27:59,343
And telling you
that I am an honest man.

713
00:27:59,345 --> 00:28:02,346
You know as an honest man that
now that we've discovered this,

714
00:28:02,348 --> 00:28:05,015
We have to disclose it
as conflict of interest.

715
00:28:05,017 --> 00:28:09,186
Then bury it,
deep in the fine print,

716
00:28:09,188 --> 00:28:11,288
Because it had nothing to do
with my recommendation,

717
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:15,693
And I'm not gonna let it
blow this goddamn deal.

718
00:28:29,709 --> 00:28:32,376
Since when did this become
a deposition?

719
00:28:32,378 --> 00:28:36,280
It didn't, but since you seemed
so anxious to ask esther

720
00:28:36,282 --> 00:28:38,015
About what she said in the past,

721
00:28:38,017 --> 00:28:39,850
I thought I'd just save us
all the trouble

722
00:28:39,852 --> 00:28:41,351
And get it on the record myself.

723
00:28:41,353 --> 00:28:43,454
What? I never agreed...

724
00:28:43,456 --> 00:28:47,257
You promised jeffrey
50% of your company, didn't you?

725
00:28:50,763 --> 00:28:52,463
Yes, I did.

726
00:28:52,465 --> 00:28:53,465
Then it's settled.

727
00:28:53,466 --> 00:28:55,299
Well, not quite.

728
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:57,133
Now that our client has admitted
that she made the agreement,

729
00:28:57,136 --> 00:28:58,469
We'd like to discuss
the circumstances

730
00:28:58,471 --> 00:28:59,837
Under which she did.

731
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:02,005
What do you mean
the circumstances?

732
00:29:02,007 --> 00:29:03,774
She promised me 50%, period.

733
00:29:03,776 --> 00:29:07,377
No, she promised you 50%
because you forfeited

734
00:29:07,379 --> 00:29:08,879
Your admission
to medical school.

735
00:29:08,881 --> 00:29:11,048
That's right, and instead
of going to stanford,

736
00:29:11,050 --> 00:29:13,751
I stayed home
and took care of our family.

737
00:29:13,753 --> 00:29:15,018
(rachel) then why is
there no record of you

738
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:17,755
Ever being admitted to stanford?

739
00:29:17,757 --> 00:29:20,290
Or any school, for that matter?

740
00:29:20,292 --> 00:29:23,827
Just a pile
of rejection letters.

741
00:29:25,297 --> 00:29:26,396
You lied to me?

742
00:29:26,398 --> 00:29:28,232
This is ridiculous.

743
00:29:28,234 --> 00:29:30,134
Lots of people
don't get into medical school

744
00:29:30,136 --> 00:29:32,103
On the first try.

745
00:29:32,104 --> 00:29:34,071
You were gonna take half
of my company on the first try.

746
00:29:34,073 --> 00:29:35,105
30%.

747
00:29:35,107 --> 00:29:36,540
He's not getting another penny

748
00:29:36,542 --> 00:29:38,776
Of the business I built myself.

749
00:29:38,778 --> 00:29:40,511
(jeffrey) you want to talk
about doing things yourself?

750
00:29:40,513 --> 00:29:44,248
Who do you think stayed home
and kept our family together

751
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:46,016
While you were too busy
baking muffins

752
00:29:46,018 --> 00:29:47,635
To make dinner for your kids?

753
00:29:47,636 --> 00:29:49,253
(esther) don't you dare
attack me as a mother!

754
00:29:49,255 --> 00:29:51,355
You cheated on me!

755
00:29:51,357 --> 00:29:54,792
Esther, I'm sorry.

756
00:29:54,794 --> 00:29:57,427
I made a mistake.

757
00:29:57,429 --> 00:29:59,930
But I did give up everything
for you.

758
00:29:59,932 --> 00:30:02,132
I put my life on hold.

759
00:30:02,134 --> 00:30:04,201
I sacrificed my dream for yours.

760
00:30:04,203 --> 00:30:05,369
I'm never gonna get
those years back.

761
00:30:05,371 --> 00:30:07,204
(esther) no, jeffrey.

762
00:30:07,206 --> 00:30:10,207
We had everything,

763
00:30:10,209 --> 00:30:11,542
And you ruined it.

764
00:30:11,544 --> 00:30:15,312
All right, that's enough.

765
00:30:15,314 --> 00:30:18,382
You have our final offer.

766
00:30:21,487 --> 00:30:23,887
This better not be
about robert zane again.

767
00:30:23,889 --> 00:30:26,156
- Just give me one minute.
- God damn it.

768
00:30:26,158 --> 00:30:28,158
One of his clients purchased
shares of kelton,

769
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,027
And if they acted
on privileged information...

770
00:30:30,029 --> 00:30:31,261
I know the law.

771
00:30:31,263 --> 00:30:32,596
Well, then you know
it's unethical at best

772
00:30:32,598 --> 00:30:35,432
And illegal at worst.

773
00:30:35,434 --> 00:30:37,568
What do you want from me?

774
00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:39,169
I want to know
if you think he knew.

775
00:30:39,171 --> 00:30:41,038
What the hell difference
does that make?

776
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,606
It's the difference
between a legitimate settlement

777
00:30:42,608 --> 00:30:44,308
And stock manipulation.

778
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:47,377
You mean it would make him
a fraud?

779
00:30:49,949 --> 00:30:51,615
This isn't the same thing,
and you know it.

780
00:30:51,617 --> 00:30:53,517
I'm not trying to screw over
my clients.

781
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:55,185
Why would you even bring that up
right now?

782
00:30:55,187 --> 00:30:56,553
Because you begged me
for this case

783
00:30:56,555 --> 00:30:58,322
And a chance to work
with that man.

784
00:30:58,324 --> 00:31:00,224
And if he colluded with them,

785
00:31:00,225 --> 00:31:02,125
We can stick a better settlement
down their throats.

786
00:31:02,127 --> 00:31:05,295
Do you really think robert zane
is dirty enough to do that?

787
00:31:05,297 --> 00:31:07,431
I don't know,
but I find it hard to believe

788
00:31:07,433 --> 00:31:09,132
That he's dumb enough
not to know.

789
00:31:09,134 --> 00:31:12,603
My dad's not dumb.

790
00:31:12,605 --> 00:31:14,238
- And he's not dirty.
- Rachel...

791
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,573
And the last time
someone called him shady,

792
00:31:16,575 --> 00:31:19,176
It was louis, and you
almost punched him over it.

793
00:31:19,178 --> 00:31:20,178
This is different.

794
00:31:20,179 --> 00:31:22,045
This is the same.

795
00:31:22,047 --> 00:31:24,314
You were gonna punch him
because an attack on me

796
00:31:24,316 --> 00:31:26,183
Is an attack on you.

797
00:31:26,185 --> 00:31:28,518
Well, attack on my father
is an attack on me,

798
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:29,987
And you're the one
who's doing it.

799
00:31:29,989 --> 00:31:31,154
Nobody's attacking anybody.

800
00:31:31,156 --> 00:31:34,291
Mike, you once came to me

801
00:31:34,293 --> 00:31:37,594
Asking me to give you
the benefit of the doubt,

802
00:31:37,596 --> 00:31:40,097
And I gave it to you.

803
00:31:40,099 --> 00:31:42,566
So the least you can do
is give it to him.

804
00:31:52,511 --> 00:31:54,444
I was hoping you had good news,

805
00:31:54,446 --> 00:31:58,515
But you're not pouring that
drink because we have a deal.

806
00:31:58,517 --> 00:32:01,418
We don't, but we can.

807
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:04,454
What are you saying?

808
00:32:04,456 --> 00:32:09,559
I'm saying they offered 30%,
and I talked them down to 25%.

809
00:32:09,561 --> 00:32:11,161
And why should I take it?

810
00:32:11,163 --> 00:32:13,664
Because he's not the one
dragging this fight out anymore.

811
00:32:13,666 --> 00:32:14,998
You are.

812
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,967
And whether or not you believe

813
00:32:16,969 --> 00:32:19,269
He gave up everything for you,
he does.

814
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:24,574
Tell me I don't have the right
to be angry.

815
00:32:27,012 --> 00:32:29,413
Do you know why
I never even considered

816
00:32:29,415 --> 00:32:30,714
Becoming a divorce attorney?

817
00:32:30,716 --> 00:32:32,950
Because it's beneath you.

818
00:32:32,952 --> 00:32:36,286
Because there are children
involved.

819
00:32:36,288 --> 00:32:41,458
When people get caught up
in divorce...

820
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:43,193
They forget
there are some things in life

821
00:32:43,195 --> 00:32:45,195
That are more important
than money.

822
00:32:52,705 --> 00:32:55,639
Okay, harvey.

823
00:32:55,641 --> 00:32:57,441
25%.

824
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:08,452
You know, you're not exactly

825
00:33:08,454 --> 00:33:10,587
The harvey specter
I was expecting.

826
00:33:10,589 --> 00:33:12,622
Is that a good thing
or a bad thing?

827
00:33:12,624 --> 00:33:14,291
A good thing.

828
00:33:14,293 --> 00:33:17,494
You're not exactly the
louis's sister I was expecting.

829
00:33:17,496 --> 00:33:19,262
Is that a good thing
or a bad thing?

830
00:33:19,264 --> 00:33:23,033
A good thing.
Definitely a good thing.

831
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:29,706
Would you like
to take me home tonight?

832
00:33:29,708 --> 00:33:31,441
I would.

833
00:33:31,443 --> 00:33:33,577
But I need you
to sign that first.

834
00:33:33,579 --> 00:33:35,629
Why is that?

835
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:37,680
Because then you won't be
my client anymore.

836
00:33:40,719 --> 00:33:42,753
A man with a code.

837
00:33:44,656 --> 00:33:47,224
Maybe you are a white knight
after all.

838
00:33:47,226 --> 00:33:50,394
Come on, let's get out of here.

839
00:34:06,478 --> 00:34:06,676
.

840
00:34:06,678 --> 00:34:08,345
Louis, it's midnight. What's...

841
00:34:08,347 --> 00:34:09,513
Harvey's screwing esther.

842
00:34:09,515 --> 00:34:12,049
- What?
- Look at this.

843
00:34:12,051 --> 00:34:13,750
It's an agreement
that esther signed

844
00:34:13,752 --> 00:34:15,819
That agrees to give jeffrey 25%.

845
00:34:15,821 --> 00:34:18,488
That's 5% more than she needs
to pay that son of a bitch.

846
00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:19,623
Where did you get this?

847
00:34:19,625 --> 00:34:21,692
Well, I was walking
down the hall.

848
00:34:21,693 --> 00:34:23,760
I saw two glasses,
a bottle of scotch, and that.

849
00:34:23,762 --> 00:34:25,328
He got her drunk,
so he could screw me over.

850
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:30,100
Okay, there is no way
harvey would ever do that.

851
00:34:30,102 --> 00:34:32,335
You woke me up in the middle
of the night to tell me that?

852
00:34:32,337 --> 00:34:35,238
Donna, 5% extra is $3 million.
How do you explain that?

853
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:37,074
- I can't.
- I can.

854
00:34:37,076 --> 00:34:39,076
He's trying to get me back
about his compensation

855
00:34:39,078 --> 00:34:40,510
By trying to screw over
another litt.

856
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:41,845
So what I need you to do...

857
00:34:41,847 --> 00:34:43,747
Louis, the only thing
that I need to do

858
00:34:43,749 --> 00:34:46,216
Is tell you you're crazy
and go back to sleep.

859
00:34:46,218 --> 00:34:49,152
And if you do anything
between now and tomorrow

860
00:34:49,154 --> 00:34:51,621
Other than confront harvey
face-to-face, so help me god,

861
00:34:51,623 --> 00:34:54,157
You will not have a secretary
in the morning.

862
00:35:05,137 --> 00:35:07,504
Hey.

863
00:35:07,506 --> 00:35:10,574
Hey.

864
00:35:10,576 --> 00:35:11,875
I'm letting it go.

865
00:35:11,877 --> 00:35:13,443
Does that have something to do

866
00:35:13,445 --> 00:35:15,345
With where you've been
so early in the morning?

867
00:35:15,347 --> 00:35:17,347
Yeah.

868
00:35:17,349 --> 00:35:18,349
You went to see my dad?

869
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:19,749
I went to see emma powell,

870
00:35:19,751 --> 00:35:23,753
Asked her how she felt
about the settlement.

871
00:35:23,755 --> 00:35:25,355
She said it would
change her life.

872
00:35:25,357 --> 00:35:27,491
You said it wasn't enough money.

873
00:35:27,493 --> 00:35:29,326
She didn't even
mention the money.

874
00:35:29,328 --> 00:35:31,228
She said, for her,
the settlement was proof

875
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:33,296
That kelton didn't do right
by her husband,

876
00:35:33,298 --> 00:35:35,298
And that was all she needed.

877
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,167
[chuckles] okay.

878
00:35:37,169 --> 00:35:38,502
So because the plaintiff
was happy,

879
00:35:38,504 --> 00:35:40,303
All of a sudden, you think
my dad's an honest man.

880
00:35:40,305 --> 00:35:42,239
No.

881
00:35:42,241 --> 00:35:44,741
I went there to see
if I could let it go.

882
00:35:47,246 --> 00:35:49,146
I know your dad is an honest man

883
00:35:49,148 --> 00:35:52,749
Because he's raised
someone like you.

884
00:35:52,751 --> 00:35:54,618
You were right.

885
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:58,722
I never should have
questioned his integrity.

886
00:35:58,724 --> 00:36:00,557
I was also right

887
00:36:00,559 --> 00:36:02,659
That you never
should've taken this case.

888
00:36:02,661 --> 00:36:04,895
No, you were wrong about that.

889
00:36:04,897 --> 00:36:07,397
I told you we might fight,

890
00:36:07,399 --> 00:36:09,299
But it would bring us
closer together,

891
00:36:09,301 --> 00:36:11,334
And it did.

892
00:36:11,336 --> 00:36:12,903
And not just me and your father.

893
00:36:12,905 --> 00:36:14,271
What does that mean?

894
00:36:14,273 --> 00:36:16,473
I mean you and your father.

895
00:36:16,475 --> 00:36:17,975
[chuckles]

896
00:36:17,976 --> 00:36:19,476
I have never seen you leap
to his defense like that.

897
00:36:19,478 --> 00:36:22,812
I did leap to his defense,
didn't I?

898
00:36:22,814 --> 00:36:24,581
You sure did.

899
00:36:29,621 --> 00:36:31,454
You think our daughter
will leap to my defense

900
00:36:31,456 --> 00:36:33,857
Like that one day?

901
00:36:33,859 --> 00:36:35,926
She sure will.

902
00:36:46,305 --> 00:36:48,538
Louis, what are you doing here?

903
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:50,457
I'll tell you what
I'm doing here.

904
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:52,375
I'm coming to you face-to-face
about screwing my sister.

905
00:36:52,377 --> 00:36:53,910
Excuse me?

906
00:36:53,912 --> 00:36:56,213
I saw the terms, harvey.
They're a joke.

907
00:36:56,215 --> 00:36:58,648
No, they're what esther wanted.

908
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:00,984
And you swore
you'd stay out of this.

909
00:37:00,986 --> 00:37:02,886
Well, it's a good thing I didn't

910
00:37:02,888 --> 00:37:04,387
Because there's no way
she wanted to give away

911
00:37:04,389 --> 00:37:05,755
Millions of dollars.

912
00:37:05,757 --> 00:37:07,958
It's called being charitable
in order to move on.

913
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:10,260
It's called
jeffrey's a piece of shit,

914
00:37:10,262 --> 00:37:11,761
Not the march of dimes.

915
00:37:11,763 --> 00:37:13,497
He should be getting nothing.

916
00:37:13,498 --> 00:37:15,232
Instead of being focused
on what he gets,

917
00:37:15,234 --> 00:37:17,000
You should be focused
on what esther gets,

918
00:37:17,002 --> 00:37:18,235
Which is to be happy.

919
00:37:18,237 --> 00:37:19,502
Wrong, litts are never happy,

920
00:37:19,504 --> 00:37:20,537
And you're using her
to get to me.

921
00:37:20,539 --> 00:37:21,688
How the hell am I doing that?

922
00:37:21,689 --> 00:37:22,838
You think
I went after your money

923
00:37:22,841 --> 00:37:24,474
By changing the firm's
compensation structure.

924
00:37:24,476 --> 00:37:25,875
You did come after my money!

925
00:37:25,877 --> 00:37:27,911
And now you're going after
esther's to even the score.

926
00:37:27,913 --> 00:37:29,512
If I wanted to even the score,

927
00:37:29,514 --> 00:37:30,914
I wouldn't come
after your sister.

928
00:37:30,916 --> 00:37:32,515
I'd be coming after you.

929
00:37:32,517 --> 00:37:34,651
And for your information,
I convinced her

930
00:37:34,653 --> 00:37:36,419
To be forgiving by telling her

931
00:37:36,421 --> 00:37:37,687
That there are
some things in life

932
00:37:37,689 --> 00:37:38,955
That are more important
than money.

933
00:37:38,957 --> 00:37:40,790
Bullshit!
You don't believe that.

934
00:37:40,792 --> 00:37:43,493
Louis, I didn't take this
to get back at you.

935
00:37:43,495 --> 00:37:45,862
I took it because it was
a chance to bury the hatchet

936
00:37:45,864 --> 00:37:47,631
And move on.

937
00:37:47,633 --> 00:37:49,566
So either let these terms stand,

938
00:37:49,568 --> 00:37:51,968
Or do what you always do
and screw everything up.

939
00:38:00,879 --> 00:38:02,746
Robert, I'm glad you're here...

940
00:38:02,748 --> 00:38:05,048
What the hell did you do?

941
00:38:05,050 --> 00:38:06,916
What are you talking about?

942
00:38:06,918 --> 00:38:08,468
I went to see emma powell,

943
00:38:08,469 --> 00:38:10,019
But I swear to god, I did
not undermine the settlement.

944
00:38:10,022 --> 00:38:12,272
I'm not talking about that.

945
00:38:12,273 --> 00:38:14,523
I'm talking about you going
behind my back to arcadian.

946
00:38:14,526 --> 00:38:15,792
I didn't do that.

947
00:38:15,794 --> 00:38:17,260
Oh, you expect me
to believe that

948
00:38:17,261 --> 00:38:18,727
After all the shit you told me
the last time I saw you?

949
00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:19,929
You can believe it or not,

950
00:38:19,931 --> 00:38:21,298
But I'm telling you
I didn't do anything.

951
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:23,033
- Then who did?
- I did.

952
00:38:23,035 --> 00:38:26,369
You said if he colluded
with arcadian,

953
00:38:26,371 --> 00:38:28,638
Then we could shove a bigger
settlement down their throats.

954
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,040
But he didn't have to collude,

955
00:38:30,042 --> 00:38:33,043
Because arcadian already had
access to that settlement.

956
00:38:33,045 --> 00:38:34,911
Which makes it
insider trading anyway.

957
00:38:34,913 --> 00:38:36,079
And I pointed out to them

958
00:38:36,081 --> 00:38:38,081
That if they were
to divest their shares

959
00:38:38,083 --> 00:38:41,017
To our clients who don't
have insider knowledge,

960
00:38:41,019 --> 00:38:42,686
Then they've done nothing wrong.

961
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:44,154
No harm done.

962
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:45,621
The harm is
you lost me my client

963
00:38:45,624 --> 00:38:47,023
And made me look like a fool.

964
00:38:47,025 --> 00:38:48,458
No, robert, they did that

965
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:49,793
By not telling you
what they did.

966
00:38:49,795 --> 00:38:51,361
Which means the client you lost

967
00:38:51,363 --> 00:38:52,796
Was breaking the law.

968
00:38:52,798 --> 00:38:54,464
And worse than that,

969
00:38:54,466 --> 00:38:55,665
They were lying to their lawyer.

970
00:38:55,667 --> 00:38:56,866
So you think this is funny?

971
00:38:56,868 --> 00:38:59,569
No, I don't.

00:38:59,571 --> 00:39:01,538

to do with it

974
00:39:03,775 --> 00:39:06,509
And then saved your ass
from committing a crime.

975
00:39:06,511 --> 00:39:08,078
You're... Welcome?

To make up
for the compensation vote,

1004
00:40:46,812 --> 00:40:49,179

This is about
making things right.

I'm sorry, harvey.

00:41:13,605 --> 00:41:15,472
It started when we
were in junior high

1015
00:41:15,474 --> 00:41:17,006
And all the cool kids
would hang out with me

1016

You were using her

I wasn't doing that, louis.
