1
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:19,480
"My husband and I are deeply touched
by our welcome here."

2
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,680
-Ma'am?
-Yes. How long do we have?

3
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,040
We land in ten minutes.

4
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:24,920
No. Martin.

5
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,200
-Will there be a microphone?
-I'm sure, ma'am.

6
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:30,120
"Little more than 50 years ago..."

7
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:11,400
"My husband and I are deeply touched
by our welcome here this morning.

8
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,280
Little more than 50 years ago,
Nairobi was a savage place,

9
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:19,800
the home of wild animals
and uninhabited

10
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:23,320
except for the occasional band
of nomadic herdsmen.

11
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,600
Now, it is a modern, vibrant city,

12
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:29,680
a striking tribute
to the men and women of all races,

13
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,800
who have made it a great center
of commerce and finance.

14
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:37,240
Now, it remains only for me
to pass on the apologies

15
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,520
of my father, King George..."

16
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:51,000
Who is, no doubt, very jealous indeed
that I have come in his place.

17
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,080
He's getting stronger every day.

18
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,800
And he will be here
with you all again very soon.

19
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:06,200
Your Royal Highness, may I present

20
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:09,960
Senior Chief Waruhiu wa Kung'u
of the Kikuyu.

21
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:12,760
-Hello.
-Chief Sironka of the Kipsigis.

22
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,840
-Hello.
-Good morning.

23
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,240
-Lembui of the Maasai.
-Yes, hello.

24
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,400
-Pelipel of the Turkana.
-Such a pleasure.

25
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,760
Oh, gosh, look, I've got that one,
and that one, actually.

26
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,520
Oh, Christ, I've got that one too.
Look!

27
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,640
Oh, come off it, where did you steal
that one from, eh?

28
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,520
Independence is sweeping
across the continent.

29
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,840
Their support is important
more than ever.

30
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,000
-Yes, thank you.
-Oh, like the hat.

31
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:45,640
It's not a hat. It's a crown.

32
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,920
Breathe in, Your Majesty.

33
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,840
And out.

34
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,800
Well, well.

35
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,840
I tell you, I woke up this morning
feeling like a new man.

36
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,040
I think you should enjoy it, sir.

37
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,720
Enjoy every minute while you can.

38
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,760
Well, I intend to.

39
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:43,480
And I'll head straight to Sandringham
if you give me the all-clear to shoot.

40
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,920
Consider it given.

41
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:57,320
-Sorry, ma'am, can I help you?
-Oh, Venetia Scott. I'm new.

42
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:01,520
It's all right. She's with me.
Come along. Thank you.

43
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,560
-He's awake.
-Yes, sir.

44
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,880
Actually, he's asked to see you.

45
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:24,000
Oh.

46
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,920
Uh... Um...

47
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,960
- Prime Minister?
- Is that the new girl?

48
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:49,360
-Yes, sir. Venetia.
-Louisa?

49
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,240
-Venetia.
-Venetia.

50
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:57,000
Have they told you terrible things,
your colleagues downstairs?

51
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,000
Go on. Be candid.

52
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:05,440
It is said... you can be difficult.

53
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,800
I can be a monster.
Did they say that?

54
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:10,040
-Yes, sir.
-It's true.

55
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,760
But you need to be a monster
to defeat Hitler.

56
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:16,440
-Did Jock give you my box?
-He did, sir.

57
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,520
What's in it?

58
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,640
-You'd like me to open it?
-Unless you have X-ray vision,

59
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:27,480
you will need to open it, so as
to be able to tell me what's in it.

60
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,240
Well?

61
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,320
-Some papers about rationing.
-What else?

62
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,080
Some papers from the Exchequer.

63
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:41,400
Anything from the Foreign Office?
About America or the Soviet Union?

64
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,720
-No, sir.
-Oh, very well.

65
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,440
Then start with the Exchequer.
Read it aloud.

66
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:51,960
Don't be alarmed
if you hear no response.

67
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,680
I shall be making mental notes.

68
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:57,440
-"The economic situation--
-What?

69
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:11,080
"The economic situation we have
inherited is worse than 1949...

70
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,760
and, in many ways, worse--

71
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:19,760
worse than 1947.

72
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,960
Confidence in Sterling is impaired.

73
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:28,240
And now our latest estimates
suggest that in 1952..."

74
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:31,680
...the United Kingdom will have
a deficit on its general balance

75
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:37,120
of overseas payments of between
five and 600 million pounds.

76
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:42,000
Given these circumstances, I'd be
interested to hear the PM's views

77
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:46,800
regarding the chances for recovery.

78
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,720
Either we get rid of him now
or we lose the next election

79
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,640
and, quite possibly,
lose power for a whole generation.

80
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,480
You must act, Anthony!
This is your time.

81
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:08,880
The country needs
a younger, more dynamic man.

82
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,840
And what do you expect me to do? Hmm?

83
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,800
He's the party leader.

84
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:22,200
And he became party leader
on our recommendation.

85
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,760
I can't just push him out.

86
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,960
Then you must go and see
the one person who can.

87
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:15,360
-Welcome to Sagana Lodge, ma'am.
-Thank you very much.

88
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,240
Hello.

89
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,760
Are those for me?
Thank you very much.

90
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:31,040
<i>-Karibu.</i>
-Thank you.

91
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:37,320
Apparently, there's a large breeding
herd of elephants at Treetops.

92
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:40,520
-So we've got to get there early.
-Not too early, I hope.

93
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,760
And why? What else have you got
in mind for our little holiday?

94
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,360
Why does everybody think,
just because we're royal,

95
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:53,160
we like fine dining?
Don't they realize we're savages?

96
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,560
Good for nothing
but school dinners and nursery food.

97
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:58,400
It's all right, you can use your
fingers.

98
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,600
-Philip.
-Look, stop, watch.

99
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,840
Ma'am.

100
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,160
Your Royal Highness.

101
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,160
Kiss me.

102
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,000
Come on.

103
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:28,880
His Majesty will return
from the shoot at 4 p.m.

104
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:51,800
-Good afternoon, sir.
-Good afternoon.

105
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:54,480
His Majesty wondered
if you'd mind accompanying him

106
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,880
on the shoot at Beecher's Club today.

107
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,600
No, not at all.

108
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,600
Still rather wet underfoot, I'm
afraid, after the storms yesterday,

109
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,480
but we can provide you
with Wellington boots.

110
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,280
-There's no need to worry.
-What size are you, sir?

111
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,640
Nine and a half.

112
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:14,400
Though my riding boots are a ten,
and my trench boots were an 11.

113
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,560
Make of that what you will.

114
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:31,200
Much of this
is just a function of age.

115
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,920
He focuses almost entirely

116
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,640
on issues relating to America
and the Soviet Union,

117
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,800
so important domestic matters...

118
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,000
are falling behind.

119
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,720
What do you suggest I do?

120
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,560
Well, as sovereign, of course,
there is nothing you can do

121
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,800
from a constitutional standpoint.

122
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:05,760
But, as a friend... as Albert Windsor,

123
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:09,800
you are the one person I can think of
to whom he might listen.

124
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:16,320
Well, that is where we run
into difficulties, I'm afraid.

125
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:20,680
I no longer am Albert Windsor.

126
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:27,440
That person was murdered by his
elder brother... when he abdicated.

127
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:30,280
And, of course,
Albert Windsor would dearly love

128
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:35,760
to say to his old friend,
Winston Churchill, "Take a step back.

129
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:39,760
Put your feet up. Let the younger
generation have a go now."

130
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,400
But he is no longer with us

131
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:48,080
and that void has been filled
by George the VI

132
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,520
who, it turns out,
is quite the stickler,

133
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:56,960
and...
no more allow the sovereign

134
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:01,600
to interfere with the Prime Minister
than stand for office himself.

135
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,480
Even when it's in
the national interest, sir?

136
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:08,560
The national interests?
Or Anthony Eden's interest?

137
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,400
The reason I agreed to grant you
an audience,

138
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:28,480
not to hear your grievances
about Mr. Churchill

139
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,560
but to communicate mine about you.

140
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,320
Sir?

141
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,880
The PM will step down in time.

142
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:41,120
And until then, as sovereign,

143
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:47,080
I do have the right to be consulted,
to encourage, to warn.

144
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:54,720
It is better to be patient and get
what you desire in the right time...

145
00:13:56,040 --> 00:14:00,120
than have high office thrust upon you
when you are not ready.

146
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,240
I speak from personal experience.

147
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,600
Foreign Secretary.

148
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,600
-Your Majesty.
-Sir.

149
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,800
Shall we begin to walk back, sir?

150
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:55,840
Use the accelerator,
we'll be all right. Thank you.

151
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,600
-Are we on foot from here?
-Philip. Philip.

152
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,320
-Looks that way, sir.
-Thank you. Thank you.

153
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,120
-Your Highness.
-Thank you.

154
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,360
I'm your guide.
I'll take you to Treetops.

155
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,520
Jolly good. Thank you.

156
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,720
Pass me my rifle. Thank you.
And the shells.

157
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,680
But I must ask you to proceed
in total silence from here on.

158
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,600
Do not speak
unless absolutely necessary

159
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,760
and then, only using a low voice.

160
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,240
Along the way, we
may have to use some hand signals.

161
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,920
This means stop and this means
freeze.

162
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,600
We'll move in small groups, single
file, maximum three at a time.

163
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:35,520
It's alright. We'll be fine.
After you, darling.

164
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,760
Stay close, please, arms length.

165
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:58,800
<i>Tembo! </i>

166
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,480
White flag.

167
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,120
Go now!

168
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:20,320
Well, well, well, look at you.

169
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,360
Move slowly around me.

170
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:30,160
They'll drop the ladder for you
and I'll keep him distracted.

171
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,920
No, no, no.
You stay with the Princess.

172
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,520
-Philip!
-Elizabeth, go. Go!

173
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,440
Right, Your Highness.
Stay close. Hold onto my jacket.

174
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:51,480
It's all right, Elizabeth.
Easy, easy, hey, hey, hey!

175
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:55,840
Hey, hey, hey! Over here! Over here!

176
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,720
Here I am.

177
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,000
Your Highness, very slowly.

178
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:10,840
Easy, easy, stay with me.

179
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,680
Now keep going, Your Highness,
keep going. Quickly.

180
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:17,120
Hey, hey, stay with me. Away! Away!

181
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,360
Back away. Back you go.

182
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:26,760
Easy.

183
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,040
You're the king.

184
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,200
Good boy.

185
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:42,200
Christ.

186
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,840
-Excuse me, old chap.
-Sir.

187
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,840
How can you do that?

188
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:54,880
-You're a bloody idiot.
-I am.

189
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,240
Thank you.

190
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,920
-I've been thinking.
-Uh-oh.

191
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:12,760
If Papa's condition
should continue to improve,

192
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,800
well, I thought
I'd ask if we might return to Malta.

193
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:19,680
-You can resume your Naval career.
-Really?

194
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,200
Hmm.

195
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,680
I know you've missed our life there.

196
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:27,920
I have.

197
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:33,000
Well, I have too. Very much.

198
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,200
I'll write to Papa.

199
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,040
-No.
-Yes.

200
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:51,920
-No.
-Yes.

201
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,480
-Absolutely not.
-Absolutely so.

202
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,200
-No, no! No!
-Come on. Just one.

203
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,400
-Come on. I just want a sloppy one.
-No. There's never just one!

204
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,480
-There is.
-No!

205
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:02,560
-No!
-Shh.<i> Tembo. Tembo.</i>

206
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:43,800
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

207
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,040
<i>Karibu.</i>

208
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:52,200
Anyone not here, speak out!

209
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,800
-Right.
-Morning, gentlemen. Here we are.

210
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:03,920
Eight guns today, numbering
from the right, moving up two each...

211
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,200
each drive.

212
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,000
So, if you draw one or eight,

213
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:13,720
not to worry, you'll be
in the thick of it soon enough.

214
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:21,120
Two short blasts on the horn
will indicate the drive's over.

215
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:27,440
So, when you're ready, into the
vehicles. Thank you very much.

216
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,120
-Hello.
-Room for one more?

217
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,880
Always.

218
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,840
-Right then.
-Easy on the clutch,

219
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:43,360
eyes on the road, not too fast.

220
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,720
Don't worry.
I'll be gentle with you, Papa.

221
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,760
Bravo!

222
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:24,720
<i>The crowd's cheers heralded</i>
<i>the arrival of the King's car,</i>

223
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:28,000
<i>bringing Their Majesties</i>
<i>and Princess Margaret to the airport</i>

224
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,800
<i>for a last farewell</i>
<i>to the Royal travelers.</i>

225
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,560
<i>Princess Elizabeth</i>
<i>and the Duke of Edinburgh</i>

226
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,920
<i>were off on a Commonwealth journey.</i>

227
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,360
<i>Nineteen hours later,</i>
<i>the Royal plane landed at Nairobi.</i>

228
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,920
<i>Ahead of them lay a 30,000-mile trip</i>

229
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,600
<i>that will take them,</i>
<i>in five months, to four continents.</i>

230
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,280
<i>The journey which,</i>
<i>but for his illness,</i>

231
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:48,240
<i>the King himself</i>
<i>would have undertaken,</i>

232
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,120
<i>was almost underway.</i>

233
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:53,160
<i>And, from there, the Royal couple</i>
<i>will travel to Sagana Lodge...</i>

234
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:28,360
Good morning, Your Majesty.
7:30, sir.

235
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,680
Sir?

236
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,560
Stay there.

237
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:26,760
I regret to inform you.
The King has just passed away.

238
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:36,520
No! No, no, no!

239
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,080
Call the Foreign Secretary.

240
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Tell him...

241
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:50,600
Hyde Park Corner. He'll understand.

242
00:25:56,520 --> 00:26:01,400
-Has the Princess been notified?
-If you mean the new Queen?

243
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,120
My understanding is not.

244
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,160
Then I suggest we do so
before it breaks on the wires.

245
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:10,600
We're trying. We're not exactly sure
where she is at the moment.

246
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:13,040
We're trying to contact
the Governor in Nairobi.

247
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:18,920
Let's go!

248
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:28,720
<i>- </i><i>We need to go.</i>
- We can't. We haven't had the all-clear.

249
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,960
<i>You think any other reporters</i>
<i>anywhere in the world</i>

250
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:33,120
<i>will be waiting for an "all-clear"?</i>

251
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,280
I've had the BBC on the phone again.

252
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:39,080
The news is breaking everywhere.
They can't keep holding.

253
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:43,480
-And no news on the Princess?
-No, sir. Is it a "yes" to the BBC?

254
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,720
It is.

255
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,240
And God help her.

256
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,880
They keep trying to start the engine.

257
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:02,560
All they have to do is make sure
the fan is off and wait.

258
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,680
No! Stop!

259
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:09,520
She's just-- She's overheated.
No, can I have that? Thank you.

260
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,920
All you have to do...

261
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:16,560
Is wait. It's all right.
I was a mechanic during the war.

262
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,280
This is London.

263
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:28,920
<i>It is with the greatest sorrow that</i>
<i>we make the following announcement.</i>

264
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,120
<i>It was announced from Sandringham</i>
<i>at 10:45 today...</i>

265
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:01,320
-And then drive to Nanyuki.
-Nanyuki.

266
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,800
Nanyuki, sorry.
In a closed car arriving at 10:30.

267
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:06,440
Morris! Reuters for you.

268
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,160
-Yes.
-10:45, sorry.

269
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,880
There'll be a demonstration
by units of the African Rifles.

270
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,160
Christ.

271
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,800
Hold on, would you?

272
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:21,640
13:00 drive to Nanyuki airfield
and board East African Airways C47

273
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:24,120
departing on a 13:30
scheduled flight to...

274
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,920
<i>As flags across the nation</i>
<i>are lowered in tribute,</i>

275
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,360

276
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,640
<i>crowds gather</i>
<i>to mourn King George VI.</i>

277

<i>in the happy company of his wife</i>
<i>and youngest daughter.</i>

279

<i>that we, as a nation,</i>

280

<i>shall best remember him.</i>

281
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,640
They don't know.

282
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:56,760
Sagana. Now, man!

283
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:22,840
- How was Treetops?
- It was wonderful. We saw elephants.

284
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:25,520
-There is fresh lemonade.
-Oh, that looks delicious.

285
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,640
-Welcome back, ma'am.
-Thank you.

286
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,960
Let's go. Let's drive, shall we?

287
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:36,520
Ready? Steady? Go.

288
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,120
Princess Elizabeth?

289
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:04,000
The Princess?

290
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,200
In here?

291
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,280
<i>Mhesihimwa,</i> Duke.

292
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:43,680
-Excuse me, sir.
-What is it, Martin?

293
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:12,280
<i>The profound sense</i>
<i>of grief felt amongst his people today</i>

294
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:14,000
<i>stems from their respect.</i>

00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:17,680
-I'm very happy to--
-No, no, no.

296
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:21,480
-I should be the one to tell her.
-Yes, sir.

297
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:16,440
<i>The King, who retired</i>
<i>to rest last night in his usual health,</i>

298
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:18,600
<i>passed peacefully away in his sleep.</i>

299
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:22,840
<i>The BBC offers profound sympathy</i>

<i>and the Royal family.</i>

301
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:20,200
Your Royal Highness,
this stage of the embalming process...

302
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,720
it may distress you.

303
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,000
Your Royal Highness.

304
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:15,440
For you, sir.

305
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:00,720
They're going to send you away,
but I won't let them.

306
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,960
I'm going to tell my mother
not to send you. I won't.

307
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,360
It's all right.

308
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:30,600
You're not going. I won't let you go.

309
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,960
Ma'am, may I have a word?

310
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:56,440
It appears Miss MacDonald neglected
to pack a black dress.

311
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:57,920
We've called ahead to London

312
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,080
and something will be brought
onto the plane before you disembark.

313
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:02,840
Right.

314
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:10,000
And a word of warning, ma'am.
A good many journalists outside.

315
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:17,680
Royal correspondents mostly,
assigned to cover the tour.

316
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,520
-Should I say something?
-No.

317
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:23,960
That won't be necessary.

318
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:29,080
Though it would help if we could
decide here and now on your name.

319
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:35,120
-My name?
-Yes, ma'am. Your regnal name.

320
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:40,000
That is the name you'll take
as Queen. Your father took George.

321
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:41,960
Obviously his name is...

322
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:44,440
was, Albert.

323
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:50,480
And, before he abdicated,
your uncle took Edward, of course.

324
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,480
His name was David.

325
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,960
-What's wrong with my name?
-Nothing.

326
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:05,640
Well, then, let's not overcomplicate
matters unnecessarily.

327
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,040
My name is Elizabeth.

328
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:12,800
Then, long live Queen Elizabeth.

329
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:32,120
So sorry about the dress, ma'am.

330
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,040
All right.

331
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,960
Ready when you are, ma'am.

332
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:09,760
<i>Shauri mbya kabisa.</i>

333
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:57,160
-It's the middle of the night.
-I couldn't sleep.

334
00:41:57,240 --> 00:42:00,360
No one in the country can sleep.

335
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:03,680
I know one shouldn't believe
everything one hears...

336
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:04,760
But?

337
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:08,360
I was speaking
with Jock Colville's wife.

338
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:10,320
-Mary. Margaret.
-Margaret.

339
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:15,560
She said that Anthony went to see
the King ten days ago.

340
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:17,200
What for?

341
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:20,200
To express his concern
about your age.

342
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:23,960
Your leadership. Your incapacity.

343
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:27,960
-To ask him to bid you stand down.
-That's impossible.

344
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:30,640
The King would never engage
in such treachery.

345
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:34,800
And Anthony would never dare.
I've been like a father to him.

346
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:37,960
I groomed him every step of the way.

347
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:44,760
Well, ignore me, then.

348
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:47,600
It's probably nothing.

349
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:50,600
Come on, it's probably nothing.

350
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:57,000
-What are you up to?
-It's my eulogy for the King.

351
00:42:57,080 --> 00:43:01,280
It's broadcast tomorrow
and the right words keep eluding me.

352
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:05,640
- They'll want you to fail, you know.
- I know.

353
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:09,160
Anything less than perfect
will be a disaster.

354
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:14,000
Anthony, eh?

355
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:25,520
I can't sleep.

356
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:27,680
No.

357
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:48,120
I'm sorry.

358
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:51,720
You're sorry?

359
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:56,160
I'm sorry.

360
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:58,120
I thought we'd have longer.

361
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:04,240
Ma'am. Three hours to go now.

362
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:15,440
-What do you think will happen?
-When?

363
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:19,600
When we land.

364
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:23,440
What will happen then?

365
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:33,040
-Morning.
-Morning.

366
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:36,120
The PM will not be joining us
this morning.

367
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:40,440
He is very much tired
from all the emotion of yesterday.

368
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:43,080
-So, where is he?
-He's still asleep.

369
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:49,320
So, in his absence, as deputy,
I will preside.

370
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:55,480
-The Queen's flight--
-Wait a minute, Anthony.

371
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:59,800
If you're presiding over the meeting
on behalf of the PM,

372
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:03,800
shouldn't you be sitting
in the appropriate chair?

373
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:06,000
I don't think that's entirely necessary.

374
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:18,880
Very well.

375
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:36,520
So, the Queen's flight
is now over Italy,

376
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:41,640
having left the El Adem airfield
in Libya at five this morning.

377
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:47,160
Sorry to disturb.

378
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:55,000
May I just say how very sorry I am

379
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:57,080
that we'll not be working
together anymore.

380
00:45:57,640 --> 00:45:59,000
Why?

381
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:02,200
I have to give way
to Sir Tommy Lascelles.

382
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:06,920
As private secretary to the
sovereign, he's my senior.

383
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:10,880
This is where I have to stand aside
for the great man.

384
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:14,080
Martin... so sorry.

385
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:22,560
Ma'am.

386
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:27,280
What a nightmare.

387
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:31,440
Charteris at least had one foot
in the real world.

388
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:35,360
And was your man, our man,
on our side.

389
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:38,240
Whereas Tommy Lascelles...

390
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:41,680
<i>he's stuck in the land</i>
<i>that time forgot.</i>

391
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:50,000
- You asked to see me, sir.
- I did.

392
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:54,800
-Will you sit?
-Thank you, sir.

393
00:46:56,760 --> 00:47:00,560
I'd assumed that following the death
of His Late Majesty,

394
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:04,440
you would,
at the earliest appropriate moment,

395
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:07,320
be resuming your duties
with the Royal Air Force.

396
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:08,520
Yes, sir.

397
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:12,760
I mentioned this to the Queen...

398
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:17,960
the Queen Mother, this morning,
who then asked me,

399
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:20,600
quite unusually,
to ask you whether you might like

400
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:23,800
-to reconsider such a departure.
-Oh, sir?

401
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:27,200
She felt that you had enjoyed
an uncommonly close association

402
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:31,000
with her late husband
and earned not just his trust,

403
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:33,040
but the trust and affection
of the family.

404
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:34,560
Thank you, sir.

405
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:37,720
In the light of this, she wondered
whether you might consider

406
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:39,240
staying on in a new role,

407
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:43,120
as comptroller of the Queen Mother's
household.

408
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:45,520
-I see.
-A kind and generous offer.

409
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:48,440
As befits the widow of a kind...

410
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:51,400
and generous man.

411
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:54,840
But, while I'm sure you're flattered,

412
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:56,720
I don't expect you to accept
the post.

413
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:59,120
Hence my discouragement of the offer.

414
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:02,040
I didn't want Her Majesty to suffer
the embarrassment of a refusal.

415
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:03,960
Why would I not accept, sir?

416
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:07,320
Well, you're asking
the wrong question, Townsend.

417
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:09,160
Why would you?

418
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:11,520
You're a decorated war hero,
still in your prime,

419
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:13,720
and comptroller of the Queen Mother's
household

420
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:15,640
has no military associations.

421
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:17,680
It would take you away
from your wife and children.

422
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:20,240
After all, the person

423
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:24,680
with whom you enjoyed the uncommonly
close understanding is deceased.

424
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:32,680
Unless I'm missing something.

425
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:35,320
Unless, there is someone else

426
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:38,200
with whom you enjoy
an uncommonly close understanding,

427
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:40,760
which would make accepting this post
more attractive.

428
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:44,600
I don't know
what you're referring to.

429
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:46,720
Don't you, Group Captain Townsend?

430
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:49,640
Husband and father.

431
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:52,760
No, sir.

432
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:03,480
You're probably telling yourself

433
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:08,440
that because no one has confronted
you about it, that no one can know.

434
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:12,800
Allow me to disabuse you
of that delusion.

435
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:16,440
Within the close community
of those that serve the family,

436
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:20,560
I regret to tell you,
that talk, ugly talk,

437
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:23,880
unbecoming tittle-tattle
is of little else.

438
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:27,560
Now I'm well aware of the toll
that round-the-clock service

439
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:30,600
takes on the private lives
of those that serve.

440
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:37,240
I am also aware of the feelings
generated by continued close proximity

441
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:40,040
to the people you are working for,
but I would hate you

442
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:43,520
to mistake those feelings
for anything else.

443
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:57,320
Will you thank the Queen Mother
for her kind offer?

444
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:05,400
I should be delighted to accept.

445
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:08,720
There's no rush.
Take your time to think it over.

446
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:12,360
Seventy-two hours... a week.

447
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:14,800
I want you to make
the right decision.

448
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:18,920
I already have, sir.
The answer is yes.

449
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:53,640
-Gentlemen.
-Winston.

450
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:55,640
Impeccable timing.

451
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:01,920
That's the one.

452
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:13,680
Your Majesty,
I've been asked to give you this.

453
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:17,440
And this, Ma'am,
from Her Majesty Queen Mary.

454
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:18,600
Thank you.

455
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:25,640
Thank you, Charteris.
I'll take over from here.

456
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:33,320
-Thank you, Martin.
-Thank you, sir.

457
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:39,640
Your Majesty.

458
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:43,040
Martin...

459
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,480
<i>Dearest Lilibet,</i>

460
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:07,640
<i>I know how you loved your papa,</i>
<i>my son.</i>

461
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:12,560
<i>And I know you will be as devastated</i>
<i>as I am by this loss.</i>

462
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:17,080
<i>But you must put those sentiments</i>
<i>to one side now,</i>

463
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:19,560
<i>for duty calls.</i>

464
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:24,080
<i>The grief for your father's death</i>
<i>will be felt far and wide.</i>

465
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:27,160
<i>Your people will need</i>
<i>your strength and leadership.</i>

466
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:37,000
<i>I have seen three great monarchies</i>
<i>brought down through their failure</i>

467
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:40,280
<i>to separate personal indulgences</i>
<i>from duty.</i>

468
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:46,160
<i>You must not allow yourself</i>
<i>to make similar mistakes.</i>

469
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:52,200
<i>And while you mourn your father,</i>
<i>you must also mourn someone else.</i>

470
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:55,440
<i>Elizabeth Mountbatten.</i>

471
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:02,560
<i>For she has now been replaced</i>
<i>by another person, Elizabeth Regina.</i>

472
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:10,840
<i>The two Elizabeths will frequently be</i>
<i>in conflict with one another.</i>

473
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:17,000
<i>The fact is, the Crown must win.</i>

474
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:21,840
<i>Must always win.</i>

475
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:26,520
-Ready, ma'am?
-It's all right.

476
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:28,120
I'll escort her down from here.

477
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:31,320
No, sir. If you don't mind,
the Crown takes precedence.

478
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:01,600
Stand by, everybody.

479
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:24,680
<i>This is London.</i>

480
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:28,760
Three, two, one.

481
00:54:56,360 --> 00:55:03,080
When the death of the King was
announced to us yesterday morning,

482
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:08,000
there struck a deep
and somber note in our lives,

483
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:11,200
<i>which resounded far and wide,</i>

484
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:18,440
<i>stilled the clatter</i>
<i>and traffic of 20th century life,</i>

485
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:26,720
<i>and made countless millions</i>
<i>of human beings around the world</i>

486
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:30,160
<i>pause and look around them.</i>

487
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:39,200
<i>The King was greatly loved</i>
<i>by all his peoples.</i>

488
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:45,240
The greatest shocks ever felt
by this island

489
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:47,600
fell upon us in his reign.

490
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:51,680
Never, in our long history

491
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:57,400
were we exposed to greater perils
of invasion and destruction.

492
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:07,720
<i>The late King, who assumed</i>
<i>the heavy burden of the Crown</i>

493
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:10,120
<i>when he succeeded his brother,</i>

494
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:15,760
<i>lived through every minute</i>
<i>of this struggle</i>

495
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:19,120
<i>with a heart that never quavered</i>

496
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:24,200
<i>and a spirit undaunted.</i>

497
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:37,080
In the end, death came as a friend.

498
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:45,080
<i>And after a happy day</i>
<i>of sunshine and sport,</i>

499
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:50,120
<i>and after a goodnight</i>
<i>to those who loved him best,</i>

500
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:51,680
<i>he fell asleep,</i>

501
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:55,840
<i>as every man or woman</i>

502
00:56:55,920 --> 00:57:00,960
<i>who strives to fear God</i>
<i>and nothing else in the world,</i>

503
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:02,520
<i>may hope to do.</i>

504
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:23,520
<i>Now, I must leave</i>

505
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:29,320
<i>the treasures of the past</i>
<i>and turn to the future.</i>

506
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:34,360
<i>Famous have been the reigns</i>
<i>of our queens.</i>

507
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:37,480
<i>Some of the greatest periods</i>
<i>in our history</i>

508
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:40,320
<i>have unfolded under their scepters.</i>

509
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:46,440
<i>Queen Elizabeth II,</i>

510
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:49,800
<i>like her namesake, Queen Elizabeth I,</i>

511
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:57,200
<i>did not pass her childhood in any</i>
<i>certain expectation of the Crown.</i>

512
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:01,680
<i>This new Elizabethan age</i>

513
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:07,040
<i>comes at a time when mankind stands</i>
<i>uncertainly poised...</i>

514
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:08,360
Wait.

515
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:11,880
<i>...on the edge of catastrophe.</i>

516
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:20,960
I, whose youth was passed
in the august, unchallenged

517
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:25,880
and tranquil glories
of the Victorian era,

518
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:31,680
<i>may well feel the thrill</i>
<i>in invoking once more</i>

519
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:36,400
the prayer and the anthem,

520
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:40,600
God Save the Queen.

521
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,480
God Save the Queen.
