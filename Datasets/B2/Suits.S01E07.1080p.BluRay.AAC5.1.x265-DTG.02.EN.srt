1
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:22,396
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- What?

2
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:24,106
God. I'm so sorry.
Are you okay?

3
00:00:24,232 --> 00:00:25,107
You know, there are
easier ways to kill me

4
00:00:25,233 --> 00:00:27,651
if you're worried I'll rat you out
for cheating on the LSATs.

5
00:00:27,777 --> 00:00:30,029
- What? Come on. Rachel.
- Unbelievable.

6
00:00:30,155 --> 00:00:32,031
Rachel. Oh, God.

7
00:00:34,242 --> 00:00:35,951
Rachel. Come on.
Let me buy you a fresh cup.

8
00:00:36,077 --> 00:00:38,078
You actually going to buy it this time,
or are you going to steal it?

9
00:00:38,204 --> 00:00:40,122
Okay, first of all,
I don't steal. I cheat.

10
00:00:40,248 --> 00:00:41,457
There's a big difference.

11
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:42,791
And I don't
do it anymore.

12
00:00:42,917 --> 00:00:44,001
Oh, great defense.

13
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:45,919
"I'm sorry, Your Honor.
I know that I murdered her,

14
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:48,547
"but I promise
I won't do it anymore."

15
00:00:49,632 --> 00:00:51,091
Look, I understand
why you're mad

16
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:53,135
but I still don't think
you're being entirely fair.

17
00:00:53,261 --> 00:00:54,511
Not fair?

18
00:00:54,637 --> 00:00:57,056
What's not fair is that you repeatedly
help people skirt a system

19
00:00:57,182 --> 00:00:58,974
that stands in the way
of me becoming a lawyer.

20
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,934
You know what? Why don't you give up
the whole saint act

21
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:02,686
since the only reason
you figured out I was cheating

22
00:01:02,812 --> 00:01:04,313
is because you were thinking about
cheating yourself.

23
00:01:04,856 --> 00:01:06,148
Thinking about cheating
and actually doing it

24
00:01:06,274 --> 00:01:08,358
are two very different
things, Dr. Analogy.

25
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:10,819
Oh.

26
00:01:10,945 --> 00:01:13,238
Whoa. Did I miss
an apocalypse?

27
00:01:13,364 --> 00:01:14,531
Where is everyone?

28
00:01:14,657 --> 00:01:16,408
You know, for someone
with a freak brain,

29
00:01:16,534 --> 00:01:19,119
you manage to forget
everything important.

30
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:20,954
Follow me.
But don't talk to me.

31
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:22,081
Oh.

32
00:01:27,837 --> 00:01:28,962
Not bad, Harvey.

33
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:31,715
The Prague hotel
in the black in less than three years

34
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:33,175
and a successful IPO.

35
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:34,927
Who said passion
wasn't productive?

36
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:37,638
I don't know anyone
that's ever said that.

37
00:01:38,306 --> 00:01:40,099
- Jones, tell me something.
- Hmm?

38
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:42,434
You have 30 hotels in
12 different countries

39
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,229
but you spent last week
in Daniel Vega's Lisbon resort.

40
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:49,108
Well, just, you know,
checking out the competition.

41
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:51,944
That was more than a fact-finding
mission. You're thinking merger.

42
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:55,114
Do you honestly believe that I'd do that
without talking to you first?

43
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,115
I know you would.

44
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:57,908
Then, perhaps I did.

45
00:01:58,034 --> 00:02:00,119
Jones, if you try
to pursue a merger,

46
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:03,831
you may not control what happens to your
business that you built so passionately.

47
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:05,457
Okay, Sherlock,
hear me out.

48
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:09,002
Combined, we're 100 hotels
in 23 countries.

49
00:02:09,712 --> 00:02:11,672
I like having
multiple homes.

50
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:13,549
But you don't need
another name on the mortgage.

51
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:14,508
It's a good deal.

52
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:16,802
Yeah. And it's my job
to get you a better one. Okay?

53
00:02:16,928 --> 00:02:19,138
Promise me you didn't do
a handshake deal.

54
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:23,392
Donna?

55
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:31,316
Who's ready for
Mock Trial 2011?

56
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:37,114
What, like,
make-believe trials?

57
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,074
Are we going to play
Monopoly after?

58
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:41,994
This is your
debutante ball.

59
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:45,455
The impression you make
on the partners will last.

60
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:48,792
- And let me guess. Harvey was...
- Oh, legendary.

61
00:02:48,918 --> 00:02:49,877
Shocking.

62
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:53,630
Sydney Thompson was a consultant
with Lunders Global Initiative.

63
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:56,717
She had a few too many
and decided to entertain her friends

64
00:02:56,843 --> 00:03:00,470
with an impersonation
of her boss, Lena Lunders.

65
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:04,808
This impersonation was recorded and
uploaded onto a social networking site.

66
00:03:04,934 --> 00:03:07,436
The next day,
she was fired.

67
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:11,273
Sydney is now suing
for wrongful termination.

68
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:14,776
Can't cheat your way
out of this one.

69
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,154
The partners
have been instructed

70
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,407
to only use the associates
in emergency situations.

71
00:03:26,247 --> 00:03:27,581
Let the games begin.

72
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:31,084
All right. When your name is called,
please step up and meet your match.

73
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:33,378
I think you mean
my bitch, Louis.

74
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:35,255
Ooh!

75
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,715
Jean Kaplan?

76
00:03:36,841 --> 00:03:40,886
I'm glad Jessica finally chose a case
with a strong female character.

77
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:45,098
Last year, I was forced
to play a traffic cop.

78
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:46,642
It was a total
waste of my talent.

79
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:48,518
Wait a minute.
You play witnesses?

80
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:51,271
Oh, I don't play anything.
I embody.

81
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:53,857
And if I'm on your team,
you're a winner.

82
00:03:53,983 --> 00:03:55,234
- Well, in that case...
- No.

83
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:57,152
Okay.

84
00:03:57,779 --> 00:03:59,988
Kyle Durant.
Mike Ross.

85
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:11,625
Mike Ross.

86
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:15,087
Kyle for the plaintiff.

87
00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:18,090
Ross for the defendant.

88
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:20,676
May the best man win.

89
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:24,096
Oh, by the way, Kyle, weren't you
a national Mock Trial champion?

90
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:27,391
That's right, Louis.
In high school, college,

91
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:28,767
and law school.

92
00:04:32,063 --> 00:04:35,232
See the money, wanna stay
for your meal

93
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:38,485
Get another piece of pie
for your wife

94
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:41,697
Everybody wanna know
how it feel

95
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:45,242
Everybody wanna see
what it's like

96
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:48,453
I'll even eat a bean pie
I don't mind

97
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:50,163
Me and missy is so early

98
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,124
Busy, busy making money

99
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,959
All right!

100
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:58,088
All step back
I'm 'bout to dance

101
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:01,591
The greenback boogie

102
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:13,186
I need an assessment of
all of Vega's hotels. Okay?

103
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:16,732
I want you to check annual earnings,
property value...

104
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,025
You should be writing.

105
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:20,610
Yeah, this all doesn't
sound like an emergency.

106
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:21,987
The Mock Trial...

107
00:05:22,113 --> 00:05:23,739
Okay. I'm on it.

108
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:26,658
Uh, listen,
Harvey, about...

109
00:05:26,784 --> 00:05:27,784
I don't give advice.

110
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:29,703
Okay. Please, sensei?

111
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:31,788
I'm out of my league
with this thing.

112
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:36,293
Listen to me.

113
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:38,462
Don't go to trial.

114
00:05:38,796 --> 00:05:42,049
It's a mock trial. I think the trial
part is kind of a prerequisite.

115
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:44,259
All right.

116
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:46,094
Law is about
control, okay?

117
00:05:46,387 --> 00:05:49,681
You can only control so much
with a jury, judge, witnesses,

118
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:52,267
and another lawyer
with an ego complex.

119
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:53,727
What if the lawyer doesn't
have an ego complex?

120
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:55,604
Every lawyer has
an ego complex.

121
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,481
The firm has
presented an exercise

122
00:05:57,607 --> 00:05:59,733
where there's potential
for failure. Okay?

123
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:02,486
All I'm saying is try and create
a situation where

124
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:04,029
that's not even
a possibility.

125
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:05,614
Kobayashi Maru.

126
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:08,909
- Koba what, now?
- Star Trek.

127
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:10,243
Captain Kirk.

128
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,537
He wins a no-win situation
by rewriting the rules.

129
00:06:12,663 --> 00:06:13,705
You're a Trekkie.

130
00:06:13,831 --> 00:06:15,332
Hey. Captain Kirk
is the man, okay?

131
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:16,708
I don't want to hear
another word about it.

132
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:20,087
Now, enough with your fake law problem.
Let's deal with my real one.

133
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:21,505
Aye aye, Captain.

134
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:28,345
You want to know
how to do a cross?

135
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:30,013
Some people like
to use big words.

136
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:32,474
Some people like to
go for sympathy.

137
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,894
But personally, I'm a little more
go for the groin.

138
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:36,895
Oh, hey, Mike.

139
00:06:38,022 --> 00:06:40,065
You mind dismissing the peanut gallery
so we can talk, Kyle?

140
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:41,566
I'm sorry, guys.

141
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:43,944
Looks like Ross here,
came to plead for mercy.

142
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:49,866
If you're here for the witness-exhibit
exchange, don't bother.

143
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:52,202
I already know who you're going to call
and what evidence you're going to use.

144
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:55,664
Actually, I'm not going to call any
witnesses or present any evidence.

145
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:57,874
- Let's settle.
- Or I could beat you.

146
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,167
The plaintiff has shown a pattern

147
00:06:59,293 --> 00:07:01,211
of making derogatory statements
about my client.

148
00:07:01,337 --> 00:07:02,838
- Hearsay.
- Not the emails.

149
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:05,215
Which have no tone of voice
and are subject to interpretation.

150
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:07,509
Which is exactly why
your argument is shaky at best.

151
00:07:07,635 --> 00:07:09,469
- Then beat me in court.
- Kyle.

152
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:12,472
There is a reason
that Harvey chose me to be his guy.

153
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:15,100
Do you really want to find out
what that reason is?

154
00:07:17,353 --> 00:07:19,604
And how do I know
this isn't some sort of trick?

155
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:21,189
It's not a trick.

156
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:24,067
It's just our chance
to stand out.

157
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:26,820
Look, settling gets us in and out
of there in five minutes.

158
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:29,030
You drop the suit, and you and I spend
the rest of the week

159
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:31,116
making ourselves
indispensable to the partners

160
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:34,578
while everyone else buries their heads
in Candy Land court.

161
00:07:38,082 --> 00:07:40,917
I'm going against
my better judgment and trusting you.

162
00:07:42,211 --> 00:07:43,420
So, we have a deal?

163
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:50,844
Daniel.
The paperwork looks good,

164
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:54,097
despite the fact that
you two decided to go lawyer commando.

165
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:56,099
But the devil's
always in the details.

166
00:07:56,225 --> 00:07:58,768
Harvey, I know that impulse
purchases don't exist in your world,

167
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:00,312
but the timing
was right.

168
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:03,982
And as for the details,
I like to leave that to my man, Scott.

169
00:08:04,108 --> 00:08:06,193
- Does he always like to be late?
- She.

170
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,527
Just got off a plane
from London.

171
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,667
Meet Ms. Dana Scott.

172
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:26,213
- Welcome.
- Hi. Thank you.

173
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:28,548
- Scottie.
- Harvey.

174
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:30,800
- Oh, you two know each other?
- We went to Harvard Law together.

175
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:32,219
Harvey was fifth
in the class and I was...

176
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:33,595
Oh, I forget.
What was it?

177
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:35,889
- Married to the library?
- That's right. Number one.

178
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:37,557
Number one at studying.

179
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:40,185
Okay. This way.

180
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:42,812
Tell me, Scottie,

181
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:45,023
what's my success rate
against you in the real world

182
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:46,775
where we practice real law?

183
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:49,611
Oh, Harvey, there should be no winners
or losers in a merger.

184
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:51,571
Just a happy new couple.

185
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:53,114
That's right.
3 and 0.

186
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:55,200
Well, I say
we let these two talk deal points

187
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:56,952
while I try your chef's
famous sea bass.

188
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:58,411
Absolutely.

189
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:01,623
Play nice. We like each other,
even if you two don't.

190
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:07,504
"Married to the library"?

191
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:10,715
It's not my fault the library
was the best you could do.

192
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:14,177
Do you have
the preliminary proposal?

193
00:09:14,303 --> 00:09:16,805
No, I just flew in from London
completely unprepared.

194
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:19,057
Try not to be intimidated.
I used some big words.

195
00:09:19,183 --> 00:09:20,809
Overcompensation
isn't that big of a word.

196
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:21,810
It isn't?

197
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:24,271
I can hardly wait to see the work
of a senior partner.

198
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:27,566
I see my promotion popped up on
your Harvey Specter Google alert.

199
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:28,775
That's not all
that's going to pop up.

200
00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:40,954
Can't remember
the last time we had a bed.

201
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,707
Pretty convenient
that we're working on a hotel merger.

202
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:46,835
Remember the mining deal?

203
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:49,504
Shaft 27?
How could I forget?

204
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:54,467
Listen, about
the due diligence...

205
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:55,802
Uh-uh-uh, Harvey.

206
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,222
You know the rules.

207
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:03,643
No case negotiations
until we're done.

208
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:05,770
I think that
might be a while.

209
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:22,579
Oh. Couldn't resist seeing
brilliance in action, huh?

210
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:25,915
Actually, I have to be here.
I'm playing the part of the plaintiff.

211
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:27,542
Wow. I knew
you were pissed,

212
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:29,085
but I didn't realize
you were petty.

213
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:30,712
- What does that mean?
- It's an adjective.

214
00:10:30,838 --> 00:10:32,297
- It means "small-minded, spiteful."
- Okay.

215
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:34,591
You chose to work with the one guy
who's going against me.

216
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:36,134
Kyle asked me
and I said yes.

217
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,427
You know what?
It doesn't really matter.

218
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:38,803
Because you're never
going to take the stand.

219
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:39,971
Really? How's that?

220
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:41,514
It's a surprise.

221
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:44,059
Prepare to watch
a mock trial legend be born.

222
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:50,982
Is Counsel ready to proceed
with opening statements?

223
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:52,734
We'd like to submit
a settlement agreement...

224
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,527
Plaintiff is ready,
Your Honor.

225
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:56,696
Which is it, Counselor?

226
00:10:57,823 --> 00:11:01,743
Um, the counsel for the plaintiff and I
agreed to a settlement yesterday.

227
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:02,744
He must have
misunderstood.

228
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:04,829
We had discussed,
but I never agreed to anything.

229
00:11:04,955 --> 00:11:06,122
Do you have
a signed agreement?

230
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:09,709
Uh, I...

231
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:11,878
No.

232
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:13,421
Then we are
ready to proceed.

233
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:14,839
You have the floor.

234
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:15,840
Thank you.

235
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:19,386
On March 31st, 2010,

236
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:22,555
Sydney Thompson was
unwittingly recorded on a cell phone.

237
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:23,848
She made a joke.

238
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:26,893
The type of joke that
I'm sure every person in this courtroom

239
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:28,937
has made at
one point or another.

240
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:30,897
And yet,
she was fired.

241
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:33,108
She was denied severance.

242
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:43,910
Mr. Ross. Mr. Ross.

243
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:48,206
Are you ready?

244
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:52,043
Um... The, uh...
The Defense...

245
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:54,087
Uh...

246
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:59,008
According to
Bowmaster v. Whitely,

247
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:00,343
if the party to a settlement

248
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:02,554
is surprised by the repudiation
of the settlement,

249
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:06,766
then the court must provide a reasonable
amount of time to prepare for the trial.

250
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:10,228
- Reasonable time.
- Yes, Your Honor.

251
00:12:10,354 --> 00:12:11,604
You get five minutes.

252
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:14,232
Vega has more property.

253
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:16,151
Debeque has more potential.

254
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:19,154
Which is harder
to monetarily define.

255
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,281
This isn't
the library, Scottie.

256
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:22,240
My guy is
an up and comer.

257
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:24,117
That's why your
guy is pouncing.

258
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:26,286
Your client
is an impulse shopper.

259
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:27,996
Which is what may have made
him a quick success,

260
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:30,123
but could make him
an even faster failure.

261
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:32,292
So, he's a passionate guy.

262
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:34,753
He falls in love with
a city and he builds himself a hotel.

263
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:37,338
Who are you to argue
with his track record?

264
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:40,508
I'm a realist. And I have never seen
a deal pushed through so quickly.

265
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,302
So, what?

266
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:44,179
So, your guy might
wake up tomorrow

267
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:45,472
and decide that he
doesn't want to do this.

268
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:48,933
Which is why I'm not showing you our
private books without a signed deal.

269
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:51,269
- Is that a joke?
- Am I laughing?

270
00:12:51,395 --> 00:12:53,938
Look, I may not have been awake during
our M&A clinic...

271
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:55,565
Except for when you
were copying my notes.

272
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:58,193
Which was no walk in the park.
You write like a monkey.

273
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:01,321
But in any case,
due diligence is a requirement.

274
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:06,826
I have an obligation
to my client.

275
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:10,872
Then, we don't
have a deal.

276
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:13,625
And everyone's going
to know it's because you killed it.

277
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:15,960
You know...

278
00:13:16,086 --> 00:13:18,338
I don't see you rushing to
show us your private books.

279
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:20,131
I have nothing to hide.

280
00:13:20,257 --> 00:13:21,925
You can have full access
to our books right now.

281
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:24,260
Great. You show me yours
and I'll show you mine.

282
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:26,679
Don't say it, Harvey.

283
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:30,517
Mike.

284
00:13:31,685 --> 00:13:33,728
- Hey, are you okay?
- Now, you care?

285
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:35,897
Mr. Ross, I'm going to have to ask
you not to speak to my client.

286
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:38,900
She's not your client.
She is Rachel, the paralegal.

287
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:41,361
And I only have five minutes,
so you should really get out of my face.

288
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:42,362
What's your problem, Mike?

289
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:43,780
My problem is that
you don't have the balls

290
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:45,240
to make this
a fair fight, Kyle.

291
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:46,908
Lawyering isn't
about fighting fair.

292
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:48,368
And you better watch
your false accusations

293
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:50,620
or I might just sue you
for defamation.

294
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:53,081
Come on.

295
00:13:57,378 --> 00:13:58,670
The defendant
wishes to countersue.

296
00:13:58,963 --> 00:13:59,796
On what grounds?

297
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:02,090
I believe that's
my line, Counselor.

298
00:14:02,758 --> 00:14:04,342
Defamation of character.

299
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:07,804
The plaintiff's video negatively
impacted the perception of Lena Lunders

300
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,097
and impaired her
financial well-being.

301
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:10,348
That's ridiculous,
Your Honor.

302
00:14:10,474 --> 00:14:11,933
In order for there
to be defamation,

303
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:13,434
the statements made
would have had to have been false.

304
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:14,644
That's not
the case here.

305
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:16,354
Then, you should have no problem
proving that in court.

306
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:20,900
The countersuit is allowed.

307
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,277
Are you serious?

308
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:25,029
Would you like to approach
the bench and find out how serious I am?

309
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:30,159
Your Honor, the defense
should have filed counterclaims

310
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:31,327
before the trial began.

311
00:14:31,453 --> 00:14:32,871
Yes.
He should have.

312
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:36,124
But no one in this crop of associates
had the foresight to do so.

313
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:41,129
And we drafted a whole
addendum just because we assumed

314
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:42,380
one of you would.

315
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:44,215
So, I'm going
to allow it.

316
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:46,217
Do you have a problem
with that?

317
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:48,177
No, Your Honor.

318
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:50,513
This is now
a defamation trial.

319
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,390
You have until Friday
to prepare.

320
00:14:56,812 --> 00:14:58,813
Nice recovery.
Thinking on your feet.

321
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:02,442
But you wouldn't have had to if you
hadn't been so naive.

322
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:05,278
Thank you, Your Honor.

323
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:10,909
How did
the negotiation go?

324
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:13,369
You come out on top?

325
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:16,039
Why didn't you
tell me Scottie was opposing counsel?

326
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:18,541
Because I didn't want you to have
performance anxiety.

327
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:21,210
- About the case. She's tough.
- You're obvious.

328
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:22,754
- And your fly is unzipped.
- No, it isn't.

329
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,505
But it was earlier today.

330
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:26,549
- You can do better.
- Ooh. Is that what Scottie said?

331
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:29,636
Type up the deal points.
I got her to cave.

332
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:30,929
Debeque's going
to run the show.

333
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:33,014
All I had to do
was show her our books.

334
00:15:36,393 --> 00:15:37,518
I can't believe it.

335
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:40,396
You gave me, like, the worst advice
anyone's ever given another person.

336
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:42,690
Take the drama
down a notch, Juliet.

337
00:15:42,816 --> 00:15:45,735
I tried to settle and I got
completely blind-sided.

338
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:48,321
I told you to settle.
I didn't tell you to be stupid.

339
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:50,615
What do you think is going to happen
in the real world?

340
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:52,033
You have to be
prepared for anything.

341
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:54,160
Well, in the real world,
I won't have to be looking

342
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:56,788
for someone to play
my fake witness in my fake trial.

343
00:15:56,997 --> 00:15:58,164
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
What do you think?

344
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:00,959
You think witnesses are just going to
jump up and present themselves?

345
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:01,960
Because they're not.

346
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:05,588
And sometimes, when you have one,
they disappear or recant.

347
00:16:05,714 --> 00:16:07,632
And you know what you do?
You deal with it.

348
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:10,760
Mock Trial is about figuring out what
type of lawyer you want to be.

349
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:13,554
And there's only two types.
Winners and losers.

350
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:16,224
Okay. That sounds great, Harvey,
but I haven't prepared.

351
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:19,060
I don't have anyone
to play my client or my witness.

352
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:21,896
And apparently, I'm going up against
someone that I can't trust.

353
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:23,606
Figure out a way
to beat him, anyway.

354
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:26,734
Winners don't make excuses
when the other side plays the game.

355
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:43,376
Hey, Donna.

356
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:46,004
I proofed that final agreement
on the hotel merger.

357
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:48,464
Quick question.
Has Harvey ever heard of spell check?

358
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:53,011
- Oh, my God.
- Sorry.

359
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:56,597
Are you... No, no, no. It's okay.
No, no. You don't have to cry.

360
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:59,350
It's okay.
It's okay.

361
00:16:59,476 --> 00:17:02,353
He says things sometimes, and they...
And they cut to the bone.

362
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:04,439
He does it to me, too.
I know. He says the...

363
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:05,898
It's not bad, right?

364
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:10,153
I can also do the Demi Moore single
tear, left eye or right eye,

365
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:11,487
if that's better
for the character.

366
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:13,281
Okay, I'm scared.
What's going on?

367
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:16,075
If I'm going to play
Lena Lunders for you...

368
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:18,578
I need to be able to use my full
range of emotions.

369
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:20,997
Oh, my God. I love you.

370
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:22,165
Yeah, I know.

371
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:25,084
Focus.

372
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:26,127
You need
another witness.

373
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:28,254
And at this point,
everybody else in the firm is booked up.

374
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:31,924
Aw! Is Mommy helping you
clean up your mess, Ross?

375
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:35,344
Am I Mommy
in this scenario?

376
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:37,346
What? Uh...

377
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:39,766
Ross is just... A baby.

378
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:44,854
Oh, my God.

379
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:47,899
I cannot believe
I'm going to lose to that tool.

380
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:50,651
Okay. Come on.
No pity parties.

381
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:52,862
Go to an outside source
for the other witness.

382
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:55,948
For the best friend, you need somebody
pretty, sympathetic,

383
00:17:56,075 --> 00:18:00,536
and most importantly, willing to go
above and beyond for you.

384
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:05,583
What are
you doing here?

385
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:07,668
Jenny, come on.
I need your help.

386
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:09,545
I've got nowhere else to go.

387
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:19,263
You yelled at me.

388
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:21,641
Kissed me.
Pushed me away.

389
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:24,018
Disappeared.
I haven't talked to you in forever.

390
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:25,603
I don't even know
what's going on in your life.

391
00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:28,481
Well, if you let me in,
I'll explain.

392
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:29,690
And I promise

393
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:31,609
it's a really good story.

394
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:36,322
So, you've been living a lie
this whole time.

395
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:42,411
Yeah.

396
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:44,664
That's awesome.

397
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,292
- Really?
- Yeah.

398
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:50,586
I mean, as far as
double lives go,

399
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:52,463
you're maybe not
as cool as Clark Kent.

400
00:18:52,589 --> 00:18:53,714
- Still...
- Clark Kent.

401
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:55,133
- Mmm-hmm.
- Okay. You're cut off.

402
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:56,467
Mmm.

403
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,597
- What?
- Nothing.

404
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:04,809
It just feels really
good to tell you.

405
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:09,313
I don't really have anybody
I can talk to about it.

406
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:11,649
You trust me.

407
00:19:13,443 --> 00:19:15,570
Yeah. I guess I do.

408
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:21,284
I like that.

409
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:25,454
Ooh, I really like this.

410
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:38,384
Hmm.

411
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:41,888
I've got to hand it
to you, Harvey.

412
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:43,973
You may not be able
to commit to a woman,

413
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:47,768
but you have been
in this place a very long time.

414
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:48,936
She gets me.

415
00:19:49,062 --> 00:19:50,938
And has no needs.

416
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:53,774
I don't think you understand
how high maintenance this place is.

417
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:56,694
He agreed to
all your terms

418
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:00,907
despite my protests that
he could do better.

419
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:01,991
So, we're done.

420
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:03,534
Minus a few signatures.

421
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:05,453
That's not done.

422
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:06,704
Want me to leave?

423
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,673
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury, please note...

424
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:19,800
Can I ask a question?

425
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:21,928
No, you can't ask questions
as a witness.

426
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:24,513
Don't ask questions.
Ladies and gentlemen...

427
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,515
Yeah, I know that.
But, um...

428
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:27,725
What are you doing?

429
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:29,143
What do you mean?

430
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:31,103
You're walking around like
you have a giant stick up your ass.

431
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:34,774
It's a trial, Jenny.
I... I have to be powerful.

432
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:36,525
But that's not you.

433
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:38,027
- Thanks.
- No.

434
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:42,990
You are charming and funny
and trustworthy.

435
00:20:43,116 --> 00:20:44,492
That's your power.

436
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:47,912
And that's great when I'm trying to con
my way into the LSATs,

437
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:50,331
but this is a courtroom.
It's useless there.

438
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:51,749
But it's still you.

439
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:56,087
So?

440
00:20:57,297 --> 00:20:58,881
Take a deep breath.

441
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:06,430
Just talk to me.

442
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:08,432
Ask me where do I work.

443
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:15,940
Where do you work?

444
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:18,276
Lunders Global Initiative.

445
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:20,820
Ask me how I know Sydney.

446
00:21:23,031 --> 00:21:24,699
How do you know Sydney?

447
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,867
She was my friend.

448
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:30,538
And I've missed her every day
that she's been gone.

449
00:21:32,499 --> 00:21:34,125
And why aren't you
friends anymore?

450
00:21:37,754 --> 00:21:39,088
I don't know.

451
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:43,050
If you do it
like that

452
00:21:44,511 --> 00:21:46,512
they'll fall in
love with you.

453
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:25,509
Scottie,
that was amazing.

454
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:32,516
Careful, Harvey.

455
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:35,144
You need to hydrate.

456
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:37,563
You just ran a marathon.

457
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:56,207
And I think
you just beat me.

458
00:22:59,586 --> 00:23:01,879
Uh-oh.
That's a lawyer look.

459
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:04,215
Law school.

460
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:07,760
Post-Mock Trial
in the library.

461
00:23:09,262 --> 00:23:12,348
Second Circuit
Court of Appeals. Class action

462
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:15,684
on the prep room table.
Dempsey settlement.

463
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:17,728
In my office,
on the desk and under.

464
00:23:17,854 --> 00:23:19,522
So, what, are we doing
a highlight reel?

465
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:21,023
As a matter of fact,
we are.

466
00:23:21,149 --> 00:23:22,483
Those were
top moments, right?

467
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:25,111
- They weren't bad.
- No, they were great.

468
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:28,280
And I just realized
this was better.

469
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:30,991
You were the best you've ever been
and I know why.

470
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:32,660
Why?

471
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:35,162
You hid something from me
in the negotiation.

472
00:23:35,288 --> 00:23:36,580
And I want to know what.

473
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:41,752
You know what?
You are ridiculous.

474
00:23:42,462 --> 00:23:44,547
Uh, you know what?
Don't do that. Okay?

475
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:46,507
- Do what?
- You think I don't know victory sex

476
00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:47,550
when I see it? Huh?

477
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:49,593
- See it?
- What is it?

478
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:51,554
One of Vega's properties
is bankrupt?

479
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,597
The Buenos Aires one?

480
00:23:53,723 --> 00:23:56,267
What, uh...
What do you want me to say, Harvey?

481
00:23:56,393 --> 00:23:58,018
You... Yes.

482
00:23:58,145 --> 00:24:00,271
- You got me. I screwed you.
- How?

483
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:02,815
Oh, my God. You want an
anatomy lesson now?

484
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:04,608
That's my shirt.

485
00:24:04,734 --> 00:24:06,944
Consider it
a winner's reward.

486
00:24:10,657 --> 00:24:12,658
Hey, Harvey.
You were right.

487
00:24:13,743 --> 00:24:16,203
There's been a steady stream
of stock-buying by Vega's company

488
00:24:16,329 --> 00:24:17,580
in the last 24 hours.

489
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:19,248
It's a hostile takeover.

490
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:22,585
Yeah. But why are they
disguising it as a merger?

491
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:24,545
They wanted access
to our private books.

492
00:24:24,671 --> 00:24:26,338
- She tricked me.
- What?

493
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:29,091
She pretended she
didn't want to hand over their books

494
00:24:29,217 --> 00:24:32,052
so I wouldn't notice when she asked
for ours. It's a classic maneuver.

495
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:33,304
She made me think
it was my idea.

496
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:34,346
How do you know that?

497
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:36,307
Because I taught her
how to do it.

498
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:39,185
So, now, they see
how strong Debeque's company is

499
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:40,352
and they want to buy it.

500
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:42,646
And they'll be running it by the time
Scottie's back in London.

501
00:24:42,772 --> 00:24:45,232
Wow. I leave you
alone for two days.

502
00:24:45,358 --> 00:24:47,067
This is my mistake.

503
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:50,196
This is Halley's Comet.
Take a good look.

504
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:51,906
Because it won't
happen again.

505
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:53,282
So, what are you
going to do?

506
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:56,619
I want to know which of Debeque's hotels
are the most valuable.

507
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:58,996
And how fast we can
get them on the market.

508
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:02,541
Wait. You want Debeque
to sell his best hotels?

509
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:04,126
It's called the
"Crown Jewel defense."

510
00:25:04,252 --> 00:25:06,253
We unload the highest
grossing assets

511
00:25:06,379 --> 00:25:07,963
and we make ourselves
look undesirable.

512
00:25:08,089 --> 00:25:09,632
Debeque will never
agree to that.

513
00:25:09,758 --> 00:25:12,301
Trust me, Debeque has enough
passion for his company

514
00:25:12,427 --> 00:25:15,638
that he'll be willing
to chop off an arm to save the body.

515
00:25:16,556 --> 00:25:17,765
Okay.

516
00:25:28,151 --> 00:25:30,110
You know you had that memorized
the first time you read it, right?

517
00:25:30,237 --> 00:25:32,154
Yeah, but I didn't
finish reading it

518
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,990
because a certain witness
chose to be distracting.

519
00:25:35,116 --> 00:25:37,535
That must have
been rough for you.

520
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:39,203
Yeah. You have no idea.

521
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:41,664
Where can I
get some water?

522
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:43,499
I need to make sure
my voice holds up.

523
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:44,750
Right there.

524
00:25:48,838 --> 00:25:51,298
I'll make you a deal.
Winner gets the girl.

525
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:55,594
You know, I'm never going to make
another deal with you again.

526
00:25:56,763 --> 00:25:57,763
Hey.

527
00:26:02,143 --> 00:26:05,229
They remind me of a younger,
less attractive you and me.

528
00:26:06,147 --> 00:26:07,940
Please don't say
things like that.

529
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:11,068
And I know that you rigged the lottery
so that Mike would get Kyle.

530
00:26:11,194 --> 00:26:13,362
Please. Rigged, expedited...
They're all just words.

531
00:26:13,488 --> 00:26:16,198
Besides, don't you want to see
what your boy is made of?

532
00:26:16,449 --> 00:26:17,658
You talking bet?

533
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:21,328
- Yeah.
- Usual amount.

534
00:26:21,621 --> 00:26:23,163
I believe
we have a wager.

535
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,583
Some of us shower
before we go to work.

536
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:27,626
Mr. Specter.

537
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:28,711
You know what? Save it.

538
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:30,504
Right.

539
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:34,091
How are you feeling?

540
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:35,968
- Good.
- Good?

541
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:37,052
- Yeah.
- Good.

542
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:41,098
Is it inappropriate to take a Xanax if
you're a witness in a trial?

543
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:43,767
I've seen clients
do much worse.

544
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:47,229
Actually,
I'm not a client.

545
00:26:47,355 --> 00:26:50,232
I'm a witness
in a friend's mock trial.

546
00:26:50,525 --> 00:26:52,610
One thing. If you get into trouble,
don't play the case.

547
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:53,694
Play the man.

548
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:56,113
What are you
talking about?

549
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:58,282
Good lawyers
worry about facts.

550
00:26:58,408 --> 00:27:00,451
Great lawyers worry
about their opponents.

551
00:27:01,578 --> 00:27:03,787
Kyle is
cocky and devious.

552
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:06,081
Figure out a way to
use that against him.

553
00:27:07,584 --> 00:27:09,209
Okay. Anything else?

554
00:27:10,128 --> 00:27:11,337
Kick his ass.

555
00:27:11,713 --> 00:27:13,005
Who's your friend?

556
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:15,924
Uh, Mike Ross.
Do you know him?

557
00:27:17,427 --> 00:27:20,554
Uh, yeah. Uh, it's a big firm.
But I know who he is.

558
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,764
Yeah.

559
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:25,351
God, I don't know
why I'm so nervous.

560
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:28,062
I just know this is
a big deal to him

561
00:27:28,188 --> 00:27:29,730
and I don't want to
let him down.

562
00:27:29,856 --> 00:27:31,023
Hmm.

563
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:36,820
Sydney Thompson was at a party
and made a joke.

564
00:27:36,946 --> 00:27:40,240
It wasn't meant to be mean
or to be taken as fact.

565
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:43,744
And it most certainly
was never meant to be public.

566
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:45,245
The defense will show...

567
00:27:45,372 --> 00:27:48,248
That Sydney Thompson
chose to publicly defame her boss

568
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:50,125
with an impression that
she knew would be damaging

569
00:27:50,251 --> 00:27:53,212
both to Lena Lunders'
reputation and her company.

570
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:56,215
I call Lena Lunders
to the stand.

571
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:05,391
Uh...

572
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:08,352
- Do you need a minute?
- No.

573
00:28:11,064 --> 00:28:12,606
I can continue.
Thank you.

574
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:16,694
Please.

575
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,322
I'm a self-made woman.

576
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,409
I created the Global Initiative

577
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:25,953
to target problems in Third World
countries.

578
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:29,081
I take my work
very seriously.

579
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:32,209
And if a joke
can be made of that,

580
00:28:32,627 --> 00:28:34,086
fine.

581
00:28:35,755 --> 00:28:40,175
But as a woman in power, people look
at your success and label you.

582
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:43,095
They don't know
the complexity it takes

583
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:44,888
for a woman to succeed
in this business.

584
00:28:45,765 --> 00:28:47,558
And when someone
undermines that...

585
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:50,227
Well...

586
00:28:51,438 --> 00:28:53,313
We have to fight
for ourselves.

587
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:57,651
Don't we, Your Honor?

588
00:28:57,777 --> 00:28:59,445
Objection.

589
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:01,572
So, it's hard to be
a woman in business?

590
00:29:02,198 --> 00:29:04,825
That has nothing to do with
the facts of this case.

591
00:29:04,951 --> 00:29:07,369
We can only understand the damage
your client has done

592
00:29:07,495 --> 00:29:08,620
by fully understanding the care

593
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:10,956
with which Ms. Lunders has built her
reputation.

594
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:15,252
Um...

595
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:18,839
I'm sorry. Can you ask me
the question one more time?

596
00:29:21,134 --> 00:29:22,217
Take a deep breath.

597
00:29:24,387 --> 00:29:26,305
It's just you and me.

598
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:29,433
We're just going to have a conversation
about your job, okay?

599
00:29:30,477 --> 00:29:31,894
Yeah. Okay.

600
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:34,021
How do you know the defendant,
Sydney Thompson?

601
00:29:34,147 --> 00:29:36,607
We were coworkers. We started
at the same level.

602
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:39,193
And then, I was promoted
to be her immediate superior.

603
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:41,320
And do you know about
the video in question?

604
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:43,030
Yes, I was at the party
that night.

605
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:44,656
And what were you
celebrating that night?

606
00:29:45,074 --> 00:29:46,658
My promotion.

607
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:48,327
Same night?

608
00:29:48,703 --> 00:29:49,953
That's interesting.

609
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:53,415
Ms. Ginnesse, what did you think
of the impersonation?

610
00:29:54,542 --> 00:29:56,919
It was too far.
It was mean.

611
00:29:57,212 --> 00:29:59,671
So, why do you think
Ms. Thompson did it?

612
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:02,466
Ms. Lunders promoted me.
Sydney hated it.

613
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:04,635
And that's why
she made the video.

614
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:07,346
Well, thank you,
Ms. Ginnesse.

615
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:08,764
Nothing further,
Your Honor.

616
00:30:11,434 --> 00:30:14,978
Did Sydney ever tell you
that she hated your promotion?

617
00:30:15,104 --> 00:30:16,730
- Not exactly.
- Yes or no, please.

618
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:19,733
- No.
- Well, then, how do you know

619
00:30:19,859 --> 00:30:21,443
that she hated
your promotion?

620
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:23,987
I could just tell.

621
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:25,656
Can you tell what
I'm thinking right now?

622
00:30:25,865 --> 00:30:28,075
That you're wishing I would agree
with everything you say?

623
00:30:28,201 --> 00:30:29,076
No.

624
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:30,994
I was thinking that if you could
actually read my mind,

625
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,329
I wouldn't bother
asking you questions.

626
00:30:32,455 --> 00:30:33,622
But you can't read
my mind, can you?

627
00:30:33,748 --> 00:30:36,124
No, I'm a managing director.
Not a magician.

628
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:38,544
No. And I'm pretty sure you can't read
Sydney's, either.

629
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:42,047
And you actually have no idea why
she made that video.

630
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:43,131
Correct?

631
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:47,636
I guess I don't. No.

632
00:30:51,766 --> 00:30:53,225
Good afternoon, Ms. Scott.

633
00:30:55,144 --> 00:30:56,228
Thank you.

634
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:01,066
Are you here to give me
a proper send-off?

635
00:31:01,192 --> 00:31:03,485
I don't think we can
do that out here on the street.

636
00:31:03,611 --> 00:31:04,945
You sure?

637
00:31:05,071 --> 00:31:07,155
You tricked me.
I'm impressed.

638
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:10,868
To be fair,
Vega did want a merger.

639
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:13,996
I just convinced him that given your
client's propensity for rash purchases,

640
00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:16,665
that allowing him
to stay in charge was a bad idea.

641
00:31:16,791 --> 00:31:18,542
Vega needed Debeque's hotels
minus Debeque.

642
00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:20,586
And
I found a way.

643
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:22,504
One that he never
asked for or wanted.

644
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:24,298
And one that he's
never going to get.

645
00:31:27,594 --> 00:31:30,053
Is...
Is this for real?

646
00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:32,681
Three of Debeque's properties that will
be on the market by the end of day.

647
00:31:32,807 --> 00:31:34,725
He's never going to let you sell off
his crown jewels.

648
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:36,560
See, that's the thing
about passionate clients.

649
00:31:36,811 --> 00:31:38,520
When they're crossed,
they get angry.

650
00:31:38,646 --> 00:31:40,272
And they'll do anything
to get back.

651
00:31:43,026 --> 00:31:44,151
Don't do this, Harvey.

652
00:31:44,277 --> 00:31:47,237
Look.
There's another way we can do this.

653
00:31:47,363 --> 00:31:49,281
We can get our clients
into a room together,

654
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:50,782
you can tell them
you were wrong,

655
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:53,201
and we can convince them
back into a merger.

656
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:59,708
Ms. Thompson, what was the intent
behind your impersonation?

657
00:31:59,834 --> 00:32:01,501
I was just trying
to be funny.

658
00:32:01,628 --> 00:32:04,087
Everyone in our office
makes jokes.

659
00:32:04,213 --> 00:32:06,506
As a matter of fact, Ms. Lunders
encourages us to be informal.

660
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:08,842
I can't win this
just on the facts.

661
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:11,053
But I expected it.

662
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:14,765
I think everyone has
the impulse to move up

663
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:16,516
and at a certain point,
you just have to let it go.

664
00:32:16,643 --> 00:32:17,809
So, that's what I did.

665
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:19,186
What are you
going to do?

666
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:23,273
I'm going to play the woman,
not the case.

667
00:32:25,068 --> 00:32:27,903
You say you expected to be passed over
for a promotion, correct?

668
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:30,489
- Yes.
- And yet, you applied three times.

669
00:32:30,698 --> 00:32:32,240
- Yes.
- And you were never promoted.

670
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:34,409
As I said. Yes.

671
00:32:34,535 --> 00:32:37,955
When Nora Ginnesse was promoted,
you wrote scathing emails

672
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:39,831
to the rest of your coworkers
in response.

673
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:42,000
Not scathing.
The intent was to be funny.

674
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:43,669
Oh, right.
You like to be funny.

675
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:45,128
Who doesn't like
to laugh?

676
00:32:45,254 --> 00:32:47,047
Someone whose reputation
has been ruined.

677
00:32:47,173 --> 00:32:48,173
- Objection.
- Just a thought.

678
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:49,174
He's testifying.

679
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:51,593
Sustained.
Mr. Ross, questions.

680
00:32:51,719 --> 00:32:54,346
I'm sorry, Your Honor. Forgive me.
I was just trying to be funny.

681
00:32:54,764 --> 00:32:57,349
On your performance review,
Lena Lunders wrote,

682
00:32:57,475 --> 00:33:00,394
"Good work ethic,
lacks skills."

683
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:02,771
Do you think that's
a fair assessment?

684
00:33:02,897 --> 00:33:04,606
Fair? I...
I don't know.

685
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:08,902
Your coworkers were promoted and your
boss was calling you mediocre.

686
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:11,697
Are you mediocre?

687
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,198
No.

688
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:14,783
So, why haven't
you been promoted?

689
00:33:15,034 --> 00:33:16,076
I don't know.

690
00:33:16,202 --> 00:33:17,661
Do you think
you deserve better?

691
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:18,954
Doesn't everyone?

692
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,998
- So, why haven't you tried?
- I have tried.

693
00:33:21,124 --> 00:33:22,457
Why haven't you improved?

694
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:23,542
I didn't say
I haven't improved.

695
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:25,168
Well, your review did.

696
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:27,671
Your five years
without a promotion did.

697
00:33:27,797 --> 00:33:30,632
Look. You were so angry
that you weren't moving forward

698
00:33:30,758 --> 00:33:32,467
that you lashed out
at your boss...

699
00:33:32,593 --> 00:33:33,719
- Objection. Testifying.
- No.

700
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:35,637
- And everyone was moving past you.
- So, what?

701
00:33:35,763 --> 00:33:37,806
- People making good on their potential.
- Badgering, Your Honor.

702
00:33:37,932 --> 00:33:40,559
- People who can cut it.
- I can cut it!

703
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:57,159
Excuse me, Your Honor.

704
00:33:58,536 --> 00:34:00,662
Settlement's still
on the table.

705
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:01,997
- What?
- Let's settle.

706
00:34:02,123 --> 00:34:03,582
Same deal. Win-win.

707
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:07,753
No, I'm good.

708
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:08,712
Excuse me?

709
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:10,172
I've seen the dreamy
looks, Ross.

710
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:12,132
You like her.
So, you're offering me a settlement

711
00:34:12,258 --> 00:34:14,634
because you don't want
to hurt her feelings.

712
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:17,179
But I'd rather see
if you'll break her.

713
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:20,057
Giddy-up, cowboy.

714
00:34:20,767 --> 00:34:21,975
Counselor.

715
00:34:23,227 --> 00:34:24,978
Would you like to proceed?

716
00:34:33,112 --> 00:34:34,488
No, Your Honor.

717
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:37,157
Are you sure?

718
00:34:37,283 --> 00:34:38,158
Yes, Your Honor.

719
00:34:39,368 --> 00:34:40,952
Nothing further.

720
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:47,709
Well,

721
00:34:47,835 --> 00:34:50,879
normally, we'd move on
to closing statements.

722
00:34:51,005 --> 00:34:55,717
But it's been a long week. And honestly,
we all know where this is going.

723
00:34:55,843 --> 00:34:59,429
So, the court rules in favor of
the defendant.

724
00:34:59,555 --> 00:35:01,681
Court is adjourned.

725
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:07,145
Mr. Ross.

726
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:18,740
Naive and soft.

727
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:22,285
Not qualities we're looking for
at Pearson Hardman.

728
00:35:49,021 --> 00:35:52,190
Gentlemen, I appreciate you
leaving the swords at home.

729
00:35:52,316 --> 00:35:54,109
What started off
as a true merger

730
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:55,777
never needed to become
anything different.

731
00:35:55,903 --> 00:35:57,696
Daniel, I want you
to listen to me.

732
00:35:57,822 --> 00:36:00,073
I know Harvey, and he just wants to
merge your businesses

733
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:01,241
so he can double
his billable hours.

734
00:36:01,367 --> 00:36:02,701
Quiet, Scott.

735
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:04,077
I want to hear
what he has to say.

736
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:08,165
I'm just here to get my client
the deal that he wants.

737
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:10,500
And what he wants is a merger.
Is that right, Jones?

738
00:36:10,626 --> 00:36:11,501
That's right.

739
00:36:11,627 --> 00:36:12,544
Daniel.

740
00:36:13,713 --> 00:36:17,090
Your law firm overreached in a situation
where it wasn't necessary.

741
00:36:17,216 --> 00:36:19,092
It's not entirely
Scottie's fault.

742
00:36:19,218 --> 00:36:21,052
We lawyers all have
an instinct to win.

743
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:23,638
But sometimes, we may
not fully understand what that means.

744
00:36:23,764 --> 00:36:24,931
We understand
what it means.

745
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:26,766
Well, maybe you do
and maybe you don't.

746
00:36:27,393 --> 00:36:31,855
For me, it would be to see both men
return to the initial deal,

747
00:36:31,981 --> 00:36:34,149
so that you can grow
both your businesses.

748
00:36:34,483 --> 00:36:37,194
Instead of having one company with
a hostile reputation

749
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,279
and the other a shell
of what it once was.

750
00:36:39,405 --> 00:36:42,616
I mean, that doesn't
sound like a win to me.

751
00:36:49,123 --> 00:36:50,207
I'm sorry.

752
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:53,877
Let's just go back
to the original deal.

753
00:36:57,882 --> 00:36:59,591
We can run it together.

754
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:13,980
You need anything? Because otherwise,
I'm going to head out.

755
00:37:14,315 --> 00:37:16,650
Celebratory drinks
with the associates?

756
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:17,943
Yep.

757
00:37:19,028 --> 00:37:20,779
And what exactly
are you celebrating?

758
00:37:21,822 --> 00:37:23,406
You know what? You can save the
disappointment, Harvey.

759
00:37:23,532 --> 00:37:24,908
- I know what I did.
- Do you?

760
00:37:25,034 --> 00:37:27,285
Because what I saw is
that you backed off

761
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:29,496
because you were worried about hurting
your girlfriend's feelings.

762
00:37:29,622 --> 00:37:31,414
It was a fake trial.

763
00:37:31,999 --> 00:37:33,917
All right? I weighed
the pros and the cons and I decided

764
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:36,002
it wasn't worth hurting
someone for the result.

765
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:39,089
The result is you just told
every partner in this firm,

766
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:41,466
including myself, that you have
a weak stomach.

767
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:43,176
You don't have
what it takes.

768
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:50,934
You know, you keep telling me that I
have to decide

769
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:53,270
what kind of lawyer I want to be.

770
00:37:53,396 --> 00:37:56,064
And if I were smart, I'd probably be
just like you.

771
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:58,650
Because everybody
knows you're the best.

772
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:03,029
But I'm also trying to decide what kind
of person I want to be.

773
00:38:05,866 --> 00:38:09,619
And sometimes, I like my kind of person
a lot more than yours.

774
00:38:10,246 --> 00:38:12,622
You want to know
what kind of person I am?

775
00:38:13,082 --> 00:38:15,125
Tough, but fair.

776
00:38:16,585 --> 00:38:17,919
I call it like I see it.

777
00:38:18,045 --> 00:38:20,839
And what I see is a kid who asked
for an opportunity

778
00:38:21,424 --> 00:38:23,466
and still hasn't decided
if he wants it or not.

779
00:38:48,242 --> 00:38:49,409
Single malt, please.

780
00:38:51,912 --> 00:38:54,289
Harvard Club? I thought you
hate this place.

781
00:38:56,083 --> 00:38:57,542
Vega kicked me
out of his hotel.

782
00:38:57,668 --> 00:39:00,128
So, you know, beggars.

783
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:03,923
Save the pout. You were head
of law review.

784
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:06,968
You clerked for a Supreme Court judge.
And you almost beat me.

785
00:39:07,094 --> 00:39:09,971
I think that deserves
a drink. On you.

786
00:39:10,598 --> 00:39:12,682
I'd laugh,
but I just got fired.

787
00:39:15,269 --> 00:39:16,811
- From the firm?
- No.

788
00:39:18,314 --> 00:39:20,148
But the firm is
not going to be happy.

789
00:39:20,274 --> 00:39:22,317
That's why I'm not
already on a plane.

790
00:39:23,402 --> 00:39:25,612
Hey, the Scottie I know
is tougher than that.

791
00:39:27,156 --> 00:39:28,281
Is she?

792
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:33,870
Whoa.

793
00:39:34,872 --> 00:39:36,748
You want to go back
to our alma mater

794
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:39,334
and see a lecture on why women are
better at science?

795
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:42,045
Might cheer you up.

796
00:39:42,671 --> 00:39:44,839
Maybe. But I'm not
going with you.

797
00:39:44,965 --> 00:39:46,966
Come on.
We're still friends.

798
00:39:48,844 --> 00:39:50,428
I'm getting
married, Harvey.

799
00:39:52,681 --> 00:39:53,848
His name is Steve.

800
00:39:53,974 --> 00:39:57,435
And, uh, he asked
me a month ago.

801
00:39:57,561 --> 00:40:01,147
And, um, when I get
back to London, I'm...

802
00:40:02,608 --> 00:40:04,025
I'm going to say yes.

803
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:10,740
What would you
like me to say?

804
00:40:15,204 --> 00:40:16,454
Nothing.

805
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:25,338
Come here.

806
00:40:31,178 --> 00:40:32,637
I'm sorry I won.

807
00:40:35,349 --> 00:40:36,724
No, Harvey.

808
00:40:39,353 --> 00:40:41,896
I would hate it
if you were sorry about that.

809
00:41:11,927 --> 00:41:13,970
You didn't have to
do that, you know.

810
00:41:14,096 --> 00:41:15,805
- I know.
- I could have handled it.

811
00:41:15,931 --> 00:41:17,098
I know.

812
00:41:17,224 --> 00:41:20,393
That was a thank you,
if you couldn't tell.

813
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:24,105
I could tell.

814
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:28,026
So, um, Jenny was
a great witness.

815
00:41:28,694 --> 00:41:31,404
Really likable
and pretty.

816
00:41:33,782 --> 00:41:36,409
Yeah. Yeah, she is.

817
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:40,705
I know I was hard
on you this week.

818
00:41:40,831 --> 00:41:42,373
- It's okay, Rachel.
- No, it...

819
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:46,461
Did you ever take a minute to wonder why
I was so mad at you?

820
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:51,132
I just expect more from you
than most people.

821
00:41:52,051 --> 00:41:53,092
Why?

822
00:41:56,597 --> 00:41:57,889
You're a smart guy.

823
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:01,184
You can figure it out.
