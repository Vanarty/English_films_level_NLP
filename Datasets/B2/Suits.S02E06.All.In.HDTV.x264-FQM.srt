1
00:00:00,149 --> 00:00:01,320
Previously on <i>Suits:</i>

2
00:00:01,420 --> 00:00:03,216
We're suing you and your
entire firm for fraud.

3
00:00:03,418 --> 00:00:04,718
I never saw this thing
in my life.

4
00:00:04,924 --> 00:00:06,158
That document
never came into this office,

5
00:00:06,225 --> 00:00:07,359
or you would have seen it.

6
00:00:07,426 --> 00:00:08,426
A lot of people are gonna think

7
00:00:08,494 --> 00:00:10,128
I buried that document.

8
00:00:10,196 --> 00:00:11,830
How can you bury
what doesn't exist?

9
00:00:11,898 --> 00:00:12,898
You think that I don't know
that there's a power struggle

10
00:00:12,965 --> 00:00:14,366
going on between Jessica
and Hardman?

11
00:00:14,433 --> 00:00:16,034
This guy gets one whiff
of what we've been hiding

12
00:00:16,102 --> 00:00:18,370
from Hardman...
I know, we can't trust him.

13
00:00:18,437 --> 00:00:20,972
Louis, is there anything
you want to tell me?

14
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:22,674
Let me explain
something to you.

15
00:00:22,742 --> 00:00:24,476
That memo doesn't hurt me.
It helps me.

16
00:00:24,544 --> 00:00:25,944
It's gone.

17
00:00:26,012 --> 00:00:28,146
Your actions
have left me no choice

18
00:00:28,214 --> 00:00:30,182
but to terminate your employment
at Pearson Hardman,

19
00:00:30,249 --> 00:00:34,186
effective immediately.

20
00:00:59,145 --> 00:01:02,280
Ray, I need you
to pick me up in an hour,

21
00:01:02,348 --> 00:01:04,916
and I need you
to bring me a tux.

22
00:01:07,053 --> 00:01:08,820
That's thrilling...

23
00:01:08,888 --> 00:01:10,388
I'm not here.

24
00:01:12,458 --> 00:01:13,892
God, what...

25
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,861
what are you doing here?

26
00:01:15,928 --> 00:01:17,729
Are you watching
<i>Diff'rent Strokes?</i>

27
00:01:17,797 --> 00:01:19,798
Uh, yeah, well,
it's the touching story

28
00:01:19,866 --> 00:01:21,833
of a couple of orphans, so...
Don't.

29
00:01:21,901 --> 00:01:23,768
It's a nice building.

30
00:01:23,836 --> 00:01:25,370
How long ago was it condemned?

31
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:27,005
Oh, great, so did you come
all the way over here

32
00:01:27,073 --> 00:01:28,940
just to criticize
where I live, or...

33
00:01:29,008 --> 00:01:30,375
That's a side benefit.

34
00:01:30,443 --> 00:01:32,310
You've got to be kidding me.
What?

35
00:01:32,378 --> 00:01:34,045
Ah, that... sentimental value.

36
00:01:34,113 --> 00:01:36,047
So just put that away.

37
00:01:36,115 --> 00:01:37,315
- Nice panda.
- Thank you.

38
00:01:37,383 --> 00:01:38,783
Grandmother. Christmas thing.

39
00:01:38,851 --> 00:01:41,353
Get your tux on.
We got a situation.

40
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:42,954
A situation
that requires a tux?

41
00:01:43,022 --> 00:01:45,023
Where... where
is this tuxedo situation?

42
00:01:45,091 --> 00:01:47,492
Atlantic City.
Can you get dressed now?

43
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,593
- Yeah, I could.
- But?

44
00:01:48,661 --> 00:01:51,196
I don't have a tux.

45
00:01:51,264 --> 00:01:52,497
I'm not Bruce Wayne.

46
00:01:53,448 --> 00:01:55,215
Don't I know it.

47
00:02:08,496 --> 00:02:10,430
Wow.

48
00:02:12,667 --> 00:02:14,101
Rachel.

49
00:02:14,169 --> 00:02:15,202
Louis, hi.

50
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:17,237
At the ballet.

51
00:02:17,305 --> 00:02:18,839
Are you an aficionado?

52
00:02:18,907 --> 00:02:20,607
Since I was a girl, yes.

53
00:02:20,675 --> 00:02:23,110
Me too. I mean, a boy.

54
00:02:23,178 --> 00:02:24,378
I got that.

55
00:02:24,445 --> 00:02:25,679
So are you...

56
00:02:25,747 --> 00:02:27,114
you here with someone?

57
00:02:27,182 --> 00:02:28,382
You know, Donna was supposed
to come with me,

58
00:02:28,449 --> 00:02:30,217
and then she cancelled
at the last minute.

59
00:02:30,285 --> 00:02:31,285
Oh, you talked to her?
How is she?

60
00:02:31,352 --> 00:02:32,486
No, I haven't.

61
00:02:32,554 --> 00:02:33,687
I keep calling,
but she just won't...

62
00:02:33,755 --> 00:02:35,122
Answer. I know. I tried.

63
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:37,324
You tried?

64
00:02:37,392 --> 00:02:40,127
Yeah.

65
00:02:40,195 --> 00:02:42,462
Are you here with someone?

66
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:43,931
Oh, I'm alone.

67
00:02:43,998 --> 00:02:45,632
I feel it's a better way to
experience the dance, you know?

68
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,801
Too distracting
to have to talk about it.

69
00:02:47,869 --> 00:02:49,570
I just want to... To feel it.

70
00:02:49,637 --> 00:02:50,671
No, I know.

71
00:02:50,738 --> 00:02:52,673
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

72
00:02:56,444 --> 00:02:57,945
I should probably get going.

73
00:02:58,012 --> 00:03:01,882
Wait. I have an extra ticket,

74
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:04,117
third row.

75
00:03:04,185 --> 00:03:05,853
Yeah, I like to buy
a seat to my right

76
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,989
just as a precaution.

77
00:03:09,057 --> 00:03:11,325
Yeah. I would love to.

78
00:03:11,392 --> 00:03:13,660
- Great.
- Yeah. Okay.

79
00:03:13,728 --> 00:03:16,096
You just carry around
an extra tux

80
00:03:16,164 --> 00:03:17,297
for the random occasion?

81
00:03:17,365 --> 00:03:18,565
Something told me
you'd need it.

82
00:03:18,633 --> 00:03:20,334
And by "something,"
I mean common sense.

83
00:03:20,401 --> 00:03:22,636
And by "need it,"
I mean you're an idiot.

84
00:03:22,704 --> 00:03:24,805
Haha. So can I ask why

85
00:03:24,873 --> 00:03:28,375
we are going to Atlantic City
instead of just messengering

86
00:03:28,443 --> 00:03:30,277
these contracts? No.

87
00:03:30,345 --> 00:03:32,012
You know, I'm sensing
a little hostility,

88
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,247
and you know what I think?

89
00:03:33,314 --> 00:03:35,515
I think that you're still stung

90
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:37,084
about Donna,
and you see a chance

91
00:03:37,151 --> 00:03:40,220
to blow off some steam,
and you need a wingman.

92
00:03:40,288 --> 00:03:42,656
Easy, Dr. Phil. We're here.

93
00:03:42,724 --> 00:03:45,959
There. How's that?

94
00:03:59,307 --> 00:04:01,508
That's right.
We're not in Kansas anymore.

95
00:04:01,576 --> 00:04:02,976
Let's move, Dorothy.

96
00:04:03,044 --> 00:04:05,245
You didn't tell me
you were bringing me here.

97
00:04:05,313 --> 00:04:06,980
And that's a problem how?

98
00:04:07,048 --> 00:04:09,316
I'm sort of banned from here.

99
00:04:09,384 --> 00:04:10,817
For smoking weed?

100
00:04:10,885 --> 00:04:12,953
Counting cards.
I mean, I was smoking weed,

101
00:04:13,021 --> 00:04:14,621
but they banned me
for counting cards.

102
00:04:14,689 --> 00:04:16,123
What? My brain just does it.

103
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:17,724
I can't help
that it keeps track.

104
00:04:17,792 --> 00:04:19,226
And that's your defense?

105
00:04:19,294 --> 00:04:21,228
It was three years ago.
I was broke.

106
00:04:21,296 --> 00:04:22,963
Well, which is it,
your brain just does it,

107
00:04:23,031 --> 00:04:24,197
or you were broke?

108
00:04:24,265 --> 00:04:25,332
What are you,
some kind of lawyer?

109
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,733
Get inside.
You're wearing a tux.

110
00:04:26,801 --> 00:04:29,703
They're not gonna know
who you are.

111
00:04:29,771 --> 00:04:32,306
Speaking of which,
this isn't Havana in the 1950s.

112
00:04:32,373 --> 00:04:33,640
Why do we have to wear tuxes?

113
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:34,841
What are you, Moe Green?

114
00:04:34,909 --> 00:04:35,943
Moe Green lived in Vegas.

115
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:37,377
I know where Moe Green lives.

116
00:04:37,445 --> 00:04:39,579
Complimentary champagne?

117
00:04:39,647 --> 00:04:41,848
You think this happens
if you walk in here

118
00:04:41,916 --> 00:04:43,617
in a T-shirt and jeans?

119
00:04:43,685 --> 00:04:45,185
You have a guest, Keith Hoyt.

120
00:04:45,253 --> 00:04:47,187
Can you let him know I'm here?

121
00:04:47,255 --> 00:04:49,589
Mr. Hoyt left a message
for you to meet him

122
00:04:49,657 --> 00:04:51,758
in the Poker Room, Mr. Specter.

123
00:04:51,826 --> 00:04:53,226
The floor manager assured me

124
00:04:53,294 --> 00:04:55,128
that he'd be kept away
from the tables.

125
00:04:55,196 --> 00:04:58,131
I'm sorry, I have
no record of that here, sir.

126
00:05:00,935 --> 00:05:02,336
Double down.

127
00:05:02,403 --> 00:05:03,503
Okay, so let me
get this straight,

128
00:05:03,571 --> 00:05:05,505
he has a gambling problem?

129
00:05:05,573 --> 00:05:06,974
And drinking.

130
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:08,575
Why is he in Atlantic City?

131
00:05:08,643 --> 00:05:10,243
Because he's
the keynote speaker

132
00:05:10,311 --> 00:05:11,645
at a clean energy conference,

133
00:05:11,713 --> 00:05:14,181
and he promised me
he'd stay out of trouble.

134
00:05:14,248 --> 00:05:15,749
And you took the word
of an addict?

135
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:19,753
He's been clean five years.

136
00:05:19,821 --> 00:05:21,321
No drinking, no gambling.

137
00:05:21,389 --> 00:05:22,489
So that's why you're here.

138
00:05:22,557 --> 00:05:23,690
You're concerned about him.

139
00:05:23,758 --> 00:05:25,359
- Yes.
- But you also want to gamble.

140
00:05:25,426 --> 00:05:28,061
He has a problem.
I do not have a problem.

141
00:05:28,129 --> 00:05:30,130
Uhhuh.

142
00:05:35,003 --> 00:05:37,704
Holy shit.

143
00:05:37,772 --> 00:05:38,905
Look at this guy.

144
00:05:38,973 --> 00:05:41,008
Those are $25,000 chips.

145
00:05:41,075 --> 00:05:44,644
That's three stacks of four...
by seven...

146
00:05:44,712 --> 00:05:47,147
That is $3,125,000.

147
00:05:47,215 --> 00:05:49,683
That's Keith.

148
00:05:49,751 --> 00:05:52,819
Well, at least we don't have
to worry about him losing.

149
00:05:52,887 --> 00:05:55,288
All in.

150
00:05:55,356 --> 00:05:56,823
- Or...
- Keith.

151
00:05:56,891 --> 00:05:58,892
Harvey.

152
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,394
This is a bad idea.

153
00:06:00,461 --> 00:06:02,496
You haven't seen my hand.

154
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,535
I call.

155
00:06:16,244 --> 00:06:17,611
Straight.

156
00:06:23,351 --> 00:06:24,851
Full house.

157
00:06:24,919 --> 00:06:26,286
- He's got one out.
- Yeah, we're fine

158
00:06:26,354 --> 00:06:29,656
- unless the river's a...
- 10 of clubs.

159
00:06:40,668 --> 00:06:43,036
That is some tough luck
right there.

160
00:06:43,104 --> 00:06:46,006
Tommy, please,
just give me 48 hours.

161
00:06:46,074 --> 00:06:48,742
Sorry, Keith. Deal's a deal.

162
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:50,744
- Tommy.
- That was insane.

163
00:06:50,812 --> 00:06:52,946
You just lost $3 million.
Who the hell's that guy?

164
00:06:53,014 --> 00:06:56,516
It's worse. That napkin...

165
00:06:56,584 --> 00:06:58,518

Explain to me,
how you sell your company

176
00:07:37,087 --> 00:07:38,888
on a cocktail napkin
at a poker table.

177
00:07:38,956 --> 00:07:39,989
I didn't sell it.

178
00:07:40,057 --> 00:07:42,792
I just put it up as collateral.

179
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:45,461
On a cocktail napkin
at a poker table.

180
00:07:45,529 --> 00:07:47,897
I had aces full of kings.

181
00:07:47,965 --> 00:07:49,132
The odds were with him.

182
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:51,000
Come on, you saw it.
It was bullshit.

183
00:07:51,068 --> 00:07:53,002
The guy rivered me.
No, what's bullshit is,

184
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:54,404
you should have
never been at that table

185
00:07:54,471 --> 00:07:56,506
in the first place,
much less drunk at that table.

186
00:07:56,573 --> 00:07:58,007
I gave
the keynote speech, Harvey.

187
00:07:58,075 --> 00:08:01,511
They toasted me.
I had... one drink.

188
00:08:01,578 --> 00:08:03,246
You're an alcoholic
at a casino.

189
00:08:03,313 --> 00:08:04,747
You don't get any drinks.

190
00:08:04,815 --> 00:08:07,817
I'm not an alcoholic.
I'm a compulsive gambler.

191
00:08:07,885 --> 00:08:09,786
And those dots
aren't connected?

192
00:08:09,853 --> 00:08:11,988
Let me explain.
You had a drink.

193
00:08:12,055 --> 00:08:14,023
You gambled.
You lost your company.

194
00:08:14,091 --> 00:08:17,260
I know, it was stupid.
Is there anything we can do?

195
00:08:17,327 --> 00:08:18,261
What I should do
is walk through that door

196
00:08:18,328 --> 00:08:19,262
and make you live with this.

197
00:08:19,329 --> 00:08:20,563
Well, you won't, will you?

198
00:08:20,631 --> 00:08:23,366
Because you owe me.

199
00:08:28,105 --> 00:08:31,307
What exactly was on the napkin?

200
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:33,276
I don't remember exactly,

201
00:08:33,343 --> 00:08:34,911
but the deal was,
he was gonna give me

202
00:08:34,978 --> 00:08:36,579
$3 million to back my bet,

203
00:08:36,647 --> 00:08:38,448
and when I won,
I'd give him his money back

204
00:08:38,515 --> 00:08:40,283
with an extra $1/2 million.

205
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:42,418
And if you lost,
he'd just get the company.

206
00:08:44,254 --> 00:08:45,955
I didn't think I could lose.

207
00:08:46,023 --> 00:08:48,357
We need to get
a look at that napkin.

208
00:08:48,425 --> 00:08:50,026
Need to get
a look at that napkin.

209
00:08:50,093 --> 00:08:52,028
You need to keep an eye on him
and make sure he doesn't

210
00:08:52,095 --> 00:08:54,564
touch a drink, a chip,
or a deck of cards.

211
00:08:54,631 --> 00:08:56,232
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
I'm at Atlantic City.

212
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,667
I'm in a tux.
You want me babysitting?

213
00:08:57,734 --> 00:08:58,835
I'm supposed to be
your wingman.

214
00:08:58,902 --> 00:09:00,369
I'm trusting you with him.

215
00:09:00,437 --> 00:09:02,371
That is being my wingman.

216
00:09:02,439 --> 00:09:04,574
No, th...

217
00:09:07,544 --> 00:09:09,278
- Magnificent.
- Superb.

218
00:09:09,346 --> 00:09:11,314
- Riveting.
- Outrageous.

219
00:09:11,381 --> 00:09:12,482
Insulting.

220
00:09:12,549 --> 00:09:15,318
Disgusting.

221
00:09:15,385 --> 00:09:16,819
Don't let it ruin your evening.

222
00:09:16,887 --> 00:09:18,721
- I'm... I mean, I won't.
- No.

223
00:09:18,789 --> 00:09:19,856
- I won't.
- Yeah.

224
00:09:19,923 --> 00:09:21,724
I wo hey, asshole.

225
00:09:21,792 --> 00:09:23,059
Why don't you have
a little more respect for the...

226
00:09:23,126 --> 00:09:24,360
oh, my God, it's you.

227
00:09:24,428 --> 00:09:28,364
- Yes, it is I.
- Sergei Baskov!

228
00:09:28,432 --> 00:09:30,800
I profaned at you.
I'm so sorry.

229
00:09:30,868 --> 00:09:32,969
No, no, no, please,
you're defending the ballet.

230
00:09:33,036 --> 00:09:34,904
I was defending the ballet.

231
00:09:34,972 --> 00:09:39,075
Our rehearsal space...

232
00:09:39,142 --> 00:09:42,278
two ballerinas
sprained their ankles.

233
00:09:42,346 --> 00:09:44,647
Well, that's why Katya
didn't dance tonight.

234
00:09:44,715 --> 00:09:45,915
- Of course.
- Sadly, yes.

235
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:48,551
The Royal Hall is
beautiful, magnificent,

236
00:09:48,619 --> 00:09:52,288
but behind the scenes,
they look with a blind eye.

237
00:09:52,356 --> 00:09:55,191
Well, if I may be so bold,

238
00:09:55,259 --> 00:09:56,626
please, it would be my honor

239
00:09:56,693 --> 00:09:58,461
to right this wrong for you.

240
00:09:58,529 --> 00:10:00,129
Oh, I could not impose.

241
00:10:00,197 --> 00:10:03,499
Thank you so much though.

242
00:10:03,567 --> 00:10:04,934
Please, allow me
to be your Nutcracker

243
00:10:05,002 --> 00:10:06,769
and join in the battle
against the Mouse King.

244
00:10:06,837 --> 00:10:08,037
The Mouse King.

245
00:10:08,105 --> 00:10:09,939
Well, in that instance,

246
00:10:10,007 --> 00:10:13,409
then I would be in your debt,
Mr... Light.

247
00:10:13,477 --> 00:10:14,677
- It's actually Mr...
- Wonderful.

248
00:10:14,745 --> 00:10:16,379
Thank you. Wonderful.

249
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:32,628
Oh, excuse me,
I'm terribly sorry.

250
00:10:32,696 --> 00:10:34,797
You know what
a napkin's good for, Tommy?

251
00:10:34,865 --> 00:10:37,466
That's what
a napkin's good for.

252
00:10:37,534 --> 00:10:40,803
Peter Lawford called.
He wants his tux back.

253
00:10:40,871 --> 00:10:42,338
Let me tell you something.

254
00:10:42,406 --> 00:10:44,674
Steven Spielberg
did a pre-nup on a napkin.

255
00:10:44,741 --> 00:10:46,876
Didn't hold up,
which is why Amy Irving

256
00:10:46,944 --> 00:10:49,278
is the richest out-of-work
actress in Hollywood.

257
00:10:49,346 --> 00:10:51,414
That's because
his napkin didn't meet

258
00:10:51,481 --> 00:10:53,883
the minimum requirements
of a contract.

259
00:10:53,951 --> 00:10:55,284
My client's does.

260
00:10:55,352 --> 00:10:56,852
Why did you ask me what exactly

261
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,220
was written on the napkin?

262
00:10:58,288 --> 00:10:59,789
'Cause no matter
what it was written on,

263
00:10:59,856 --> 00:11:02,291
for a contract to be valid,
it needs to have three things:

264
00:11:02,359 --> 00:11:04,160
An offer, acceptance...

265
00:11:04,227 --> 00:11:05,227
And consideration.

266
00:11:05,295 --> 00:11:07,163
- What's consideration?
- Quid pro quo.

267
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:09,298
You both get something.

268
00:11:09,366 --> 00:11:11,400
Like I get his chips
and he gets my...

269
00:11:11,468 --> 00:11:13,235
Company. That is a valid...

270
00:11:13,303 --> 00:11:14,670
Contract, yes.

271
00:11:14,738 --> 00:11:16,706
You forgot one thing:
Competence.

272
00:11:16,773 --> 00:11:18,641
My client was drunk,
and you knew it.

273
00:11:18,709 --> 00:11:21,277
Do you have proof of that?
How many drinks did he have?

274
00:11:21,345 --> 00:11:23,446
- I don't remember.
- That's a good start.

275
00:11:23,513 --> 00:11:24,547
Well, here's
what's gonna happen.

276
00:11:24,615 --> 00:11:26,515
We're going to give you
your money back

277
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:28,050
and throw in the $500,000

278
00:11:28,118 --> 00:11:29,885
you would have
gotten had Keith won,

279
00:11:29,953 --> 00:11:32,154
and then we're never
gonna hear from you again.

280
00:11:32,222 --> 00:11:33,656
Sorry.

281
00:11:33,724 --> 00:11:37,259
My advisors tell me that that
company's worth $30 million,

282
00:11:37,327 --> 00:11:38,995
and I'm keeping it.

283
00:11:39,062 --> 00:11:40,696
Well, when you show up to
open the door with your napkin,

284
00:11:40,764 --> 00:11:42,632
it's not gonna fit in the lock.

285
00:11:42,699 --> 00:11:43,933
So if he wants
to take your company,

286
00:11:44,001 --> 00:11:45,368
he's gonna have
to do it in court.

287
00:11:45,435 --> 00:11:47,837
And then,
you'll be playing at my table.

288
00:11:54,678 --> 00:11:55,611
I need a list of everything
that's wrong

289
00:11:55,679 --> 00:11:57,046
with the rehearsal space.

290
00:11:57,114 --> 00:11:58,414
For example,
the creaky floorboards,

291
00:11:58,482 --> 00:12:00,249
they're affecting
certain dancers' attitudes.

292
00:12:00,317 --> 00:12:02,585
Oh, they shouldn't
let that get them down.

293
00:12:02,653 --> 00:12:04,053
"Attitude" is a pose.

294
00:12:04,121 --> 00:12:06,789
Oh, yeah,
like striking an attitude.

295
00:12:06,857 --> 00:12:09,358
Whatever, I do that
all the time.

296
00:12:09,426 --> 00:12:11,360
Okay.

297
00:12:11,428 --> 00:12:14,063
I also need a list of
the ballet company principals.

298
00:12:14,131 --> 00:12:16,799
Okay, um, integrity, fidelity,

299
00:12:16,867 --> 00:12:18,601
patriotism...
Not that kind of principle.

300
00:12:18,669 --> 00:12:20,936
- Okay, we're done.
- How am I supposed to know?

301
00:12:21,004 --> 00:12:23,105
Rachel, you've
just been drafted.

302
00:12:23,173 --> 00:12:25,007
Oh, but she's not even a...

303
00:12:25,075 --> 00:12:26,742
Not what?
She's not what, Harold?

304
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:28,778
Ms. Zane not only knows
more about ballet than you do,

305
00:12:28,845 --> 00:12:30,246
she also knows more about law.

306
00:12:30,313 --> 00:12:32,314
- But...
- Zip it.

307
00:12:32,382 --> 00:12:34,784
My mind's been racing ever since
we met Sergei yesterday,

308
00:12:34,851 --> 00:12:37,486
so I dictated a to-do list
for you to handle.

309
00:12:37,554 --> 00:12:39,288
I'm on it.

310
00:12:39,356 --> 00:12:42,958
Okay.

311
00:12:46,496 --> 00:12:48,798
- Jessica.
- Where are you?

312
00:12:48,865 --> 00:12:50,866
- In a meeting.
- Do people often yell.

313
00:12:50,934 --> 00:12:53,202
"I hit the jackpot"
in your meetings?

314
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:55,604
If you know where I am,
why are you asking?

315
00:12:55,672 --> 00:12:58,074
Because the answer tells me
I should be worried.

316
00:12:58,141 --> 00:13:00,643
It's just poker.

317
00:13:00,711 --> 00:13:02,645
Harvey, I know
losing Donna's been hard.

318
00:13:02,713 --> 00:13:04,547
I'm fine.

319
00:13:04,614 --> 00:13:06,515
You haven't hired
her replacement.

320
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:08,284
She's irreplaceable.

321
00:13:08,351 --> 00:13:11,120
- I'm assigning you a temp.
- Excellent.

322
00:13:11,188 --> 00:13:12,688
Not for you. You should fold.

323
00:13:12,756 --> 00:13:15,424
- Damn it.
- I swear I'm listening.

324
00:13:15,492 --> 00:13:17,793
No, no, the judge
assigned to your fraud case

325
00:13:17,861 --> 00:13:20,062
just denied our motion to seal.
What?

326
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:21,731
That motion's a slam dunk,
and we need it.

327
00:13:21,798 --> 00:13:23,466
Who's the judge? Ella Follman.

328
00:13:23,533 --> 00:13:24,834
Don't know her. You?

329
00:13:24,901 --> 00:13:27,937
I'm about to.
We're already being sued,

330
00:13:28,004 --> 00:13:31,140
but I guess she decided
my headache wasn't big enough.

331
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:34,877
Now come home before
you wind up in trouble.

332
00:13:34,945 --> 00:13:37,079
I'm doing just fine.

333
00:13:40,016 --> 00:13:41,650
I had nothing.

334
00:13:41,718 --> 00:13:43,352
Are you trying to impress me?

335
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:44,887
With nothing?

336
00:13:44,955 --> 00:13:46,622
I don't remember you
impressing that easily.

337
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:48,958
I don't remember
being impressed at all.

338
00:13:51,561 --> 00:13:54,497
I need copies of last night's
poker room security footage.

339
00:13:54,564 --> 00:13:56,065
- I can't give you that.
- Yes, you can.

340
00:13:56,133 --> 00:13:57,366
And you will.

341
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:06,041
Thank you.

342
00:14:06,109 --> 00:14:07,743
Hello, Jessica.

343
00:14:07,811 --> 00:14:11,147
Ella... Ella Medeiros.

344
00:14:11,214 --> 00:14:13,315
Ella Follman. Married name.

345
00:14:13,383 --> 00:14:15,851
- I haven't seen you since...
- Your little prank?

346
00:14:20,891 --> 00:14:23,225
Oh, the things we do
when we're young.

347
00:14:23,293 --> 00:14:26,729
- What can I do for you?
- You denied our motion.

348
00:14:26,797 --> 00:14:28,864
I have to say, I'd assumed
it was a formality.

349
00:14:28,932 --> 00:14:31,500
Well, you know what
they say about assuming.

350
00:14:31,568 --> 00:14:34,370
- Ella...
- It's Judge Follman.

351
00:14:34,437 --> 00:14:37,239
<i>Judge</i> Follman...

352
00:14:37,307 --> 00:14:39,241
These allegations are serious.

353
00:14:39,309 --> 00:14:41,177
I know how serious they are,

354
00:14:41,244 --> 00:14:44,713
and I also know how important
this case is to your firm.

355
00:14:44,781 --> 00:14:46,315
Then you also know that,
until proven,

356
00:14:46,383 --> 00:14:49,552
they have no business being
placed in public record.

357
00:14:49,619 --> 00:14:52,154
I see what you're saying.

358
00:14:52,222 --> 00:14:56,192
Humiliating someone for no good
reason doesn't seem fair.

359
00:14:59,262 --> 00:15:01,664
Do we have a problem?

360
00:15:01,731 --> 00:15:03,766
No, not at all.

361
00:15:03,834 --> 00:15:05,167
I just happen to be
of the opinion

362
00:15:05,235 --> 00:15:07,303
that trials are about truth.

363
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:10,806
And truth requires openness.

364
00:15:12,209 --> 00:15:14,343
Rest assured, Jessica,

365
00:15:14,411 --> 00:15:17,880
those who have done wrong
will get what's coming to them.

366
00:15:27,829 --> 00:15:30,131
There's one thing
I'm not clear on.

367
00:15:30,198 --> 00:15:31,499
Go through the security footage

368
00:15:31,566 --> 00:15:33,267
and count the number
of drinks Keith had.

369
00:15:33,335 --> 00:15:36,771
We establish his state of mind,
then file a motion to dismiss.

370
00:15:36,838 --> 00:15:38,773
How hard is that?
Not the thing I'm unclear on.

371
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,808
I don't have time to explain
where babies come from.

372
00:15:40,876 --> 00:15:42,610
How exactly did you
get this footage?

373
00:15:42,677 --> 00:15:43,778
Head of security owed me one.

374
00:15:43,845 --> 00:15:45,279
Which brings me
to my next question:

375
00:15:45,347 --> 00:15:47,982
Everyone always owes you one,
but Keith says you owe him one.

376
00:15:48,049 --> 00:15:49,517
Why?
Why don't you just ask him?

377
00:15:49,584 --> 00:15:51,452
- I did. He wouldn't tell me.
- Exactly.

378
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,521
Because if he had,
I wouldn't owe him one anymore.

379
00:15:53,588 --> 00:15:56,023
Mr. Specter, I'm Cameron,
your new assistant.

380
00:15:56,091 --> 00:15:57,691
- Where are my...
- Messages.

381
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:59,794
Urgent to normal,
top to bottom.

382
00:15:59,861 --> 00:16:01,529
I also took it upon myself
to fan the folders

383
00:16:01,596 --> 00:16:03,364
on your desk
in alphabetical order.

384
00:16:03,431 --> 00:16:04,698
Wow, look at that, Harvey.

385
00:16:04,766 --> 00:16:06,634
He fanned your folders
in an order of some sort.

386
00:16:06,701 --> 00:16:08,602
I also reorganized
your filing system

387
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:09,970
and redid your calendar.

388
00:16:10,038 --> 00:16:12,206
Ha, that is not going
to be a problem at all

389
00:16:12,274 --> 00:16:14,542
because Harvey loves change.

390
00:16:14,609 --> 00:16:18,279
- It was a train wreck.
- Yep.

391
00:16:20,816 --> 00:16:22,883
He's in mourning
over your predecessor.

392
00:16:22,951 --> 00:16:24,885
Her filing system,
her calendar...

393
00:16:24,953 --> 00:16:26,120
it's probably best
if nothing else

394
00:16:26,188 --> 00:16:27,688
is different in there
this morning, okay?

395
00:16:27,756 --> 00:16:31,625
- Uh-oh.
- Mike...

396
00:16:31,693 --> 00:16:33,260
Yeah.

397
00:16:33,328 --> 00:16:34,695
You might want
to take an early lunch.

398
00:16:34,763 --> 00:16:37,798
Yeah.

399
00:16:37,866 --> 00:16:39,266
Oh, wow.

400
00:16:39,334 --> 00:16:42,236
Harold, can I get the rest
of the files on the ballet case?

401
00:16:42,304 --> 00:16:43,437
Sure, let me grab them for you.

402
00:16:43,505 --> 00:16:45,606
Thank you.

403
00:16:45,674 --> 00:16:47,374
What is it about ballet?

404
00:16:47,442 --> 00:16:49,276
I just... I don't get it,
you know?

405
00:16:49,344 --> 00:16:53,047
There's no words,
there's no story,

406
00:16:53,114 --> 00:16:56,717
there's no action.
It's just all...

407
00:16:56,785 --> 00:17:00,788
and...

408
00:17:00,856 --> 00:17:03,324
and like... I don't...

409
00:17:04,593 --> 00:17:06,260
Please tell me
that Louis isn't behind me.

410
00:17:06,328 --> 00:17:07,828
Louis isn't behind you.

411
00:17:07,896 --> 00:17:10,097
Hi. Hi.

412
00:17:10,165 --> 00:17:14,468
Penelope Cruz, Zoe Saldana,
Audrey Hepburn...

413
00:17:14,536 --> 00:17:15,736
what do they
all have in common?

414
00:17:15,804 --> 00:17:18,439
- They're all hot?
- No, dumb-ass.

415
00:17:18,506 --> 00:17:21,842
They all owe
their success to ballet

416
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:25,145
because it gives them
discipline and grace,

417
00:17:25,213 --> 00:17:26,747
it embodies our emotions,

418
00:17:26,815 --> 00:17:30,251
it's breathtaking in its beauty,
and most importantly,

419
00:17:30,318 --> 00:17:32,353
it expresses what cannot
be put into words.

420
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:33,754
You want
to get ahead here, Harold?

421
00:17:33,822 --> 00:17:35,656
Take ballet, because right now,

422
00:17:35,724 --> 00:17:37,558
the only thing
that's breathtaking about you

423
00:17:37,626 --> 00:17:39,927
can easily be put
into words: Nothing.

424
00:17:39,995 --> 00:17:42,263
Now releve your ass
back to work.

425
00:17:45,934 --> 00:17:47,468
I need everything you got for me
first thing tomorrow.

426
00:17:47,535 --> 00:17:49,470
- I'm on it.
- Good.

427
00:17:52,173 --> 00:17:55,476
Yes, immediately. Thank you.

428
00:17:55,543 --> 00:17:57,811
What happened
with Judge Follman?

429
00:17:57,879 --> 00:17:59,380
There might
be a slight problem.

430
00:17:59,447 --> 00:18:00,547
What did you do?

431
00:18:00,615 --> 00:18:01,882
Why do you assume
I did something?

432
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:03,150
- What did you do?
- There was a prank.

433
00:18:03,218 --> 00:18:04,551
How bad was it?

434
00:18:04,619 --> 00:18:06,687
We went to law school
together, and I got her drunk.

435
00:18:06,755 --> 00:18:08,222
- So?
- So she woke up in front of

436
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:09,790
the entire con law class.

437
00:18:09,858 --> 00:18:11,892
- It's recoverable.
- She might have been naked.

438
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,160
- "Might have"?
- Was.

439
00:18:13,228 --> 00:18:15,062
- We're screwed.
- Come on, Harvey.

440
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:17,865
She was uptight.
I just straightened her out.

441
00:18:17,933 --> 00:18:19,199
It's what you do
with uptight people.

442
00:18:19,267 --> 00:18:21,001
Why don't you
ever do that to Louis?

443
00:18:21,069 --> 00:18:24,004
I did.

444
00:18:24,072 --> 00:18:27,141
That was you? He blamed me.

445
00:18:27,208 --> 00:18:29,043
You can be uptight
sometimes too.

446
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:30,611
That's why I let him
think it was you.

447
00:18:30,679 --> 00:18:32,813
- Told him it was me.
- That's what I said.

448
00:18:34,983 --> 00:18:37,551
- It's okay, I deserved it.
- What?

449
00:18:37,619 --> 00:18:38,852
Do you remember
when he was so mad

450
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,821
when his cat peed
in the corner of his office?

451
00:18:40,889 --> 00:18:42,823
- Mm-hmm.
- That wasn't his cat.

452
00:18:46,761 --> 00:18:49,763
You know, this is no joke.

453
00:18:49,831 --> 00:18:52,733
We're being sued.
I'm in trouble.

454
00:18:52,801 --> 00:18:54,935
- I know.
- What are you gonna do?

455
00:18:55,003 --> 00:18:59,573
I'm gonna get her off our case.

456
00:19:24,299 --> 00:19:26,133
Hey.

457
00:19:26,201 --> 00:19:28,002
You're studying up
to break the house?

458
00:19:28,069 --> 00:19:29,403
Counting drinks.

459
00:19:29,471 --> 00:19:31,205
Don't most people count cards?

460
00:19:31,272 --> 00:19:32,639
It's a thing.

461
00:19:32,707 --> 00:19:34,775
Ah! Right there. You see that?

462
00:19:34,843 --> 00:19:35,876
Drink number 15.

463
00:19:35,944 --> 00:19:38,278
Your client? That's awful.

464
00:19:38,346 --> 00:19:39,346
No, no, no, it's good.

465
00:19:39,414 --> 00:19:40,447
We're even putting him in rehab

466
00:19:40,515 --> 00:19:41,715
to help nullify his contract.

467
00:19:41,783 --> 00:19:42,883
Touching.

468
00:19:42,951 --> 00:19:45,586
Harvey truly cares
about his clients.

469
00:19:45,653 --> 00:19:46,854
Uhuhuh, my idea.

470
00:19:46,921 --> 00:19:49,123
Well, you're really
coming along.

471
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:51,358
What are you
doing here so late?

472
00:19:51,426 --> 00:19:52,593
Working with Louis.

473
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:55,996
I'm sorry? With Louis?

474
00:19:56,064 --> 00:19:57,765
Associate work.

475
00:19:57,832 --> 00:20:02,236
He, um... he replaced
Harold with me.

476
00:20:03,671 --> 00:20:06,340
Good for you.

477
00:20:06,408 --> 00:20:08,542
Looks like you're
really coming along.

478
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:11,879
Thank you, Mike.

479
00:20:18,219 --> 00:20:20,687
And that was
the last drink of the night.

480
00:20:20,755 --> 00:20:23,157
16 drinks in 11 hours

481
00:20:23,224 --> 00:20:24,892
in a 180-pound man,

482
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:27,428
and that's a blood
alcohol level of .16%,

483
00:20:27,495 --> 00:20:29,196
double the legal limit.

484
00:20:29,264 --> 00:20:31,565
Your Honor, you've heard
the expression "beer goggles."

485
00:20:31,633 --> 00:20:34,401
Well, when my client was looking
at that dirty napkin,

486
00:20:34,469 --> 00:20:36,970
all he saw was Angelina Jolie.

487
00:20:37,038 --> 00:20:40,574
Your Honor, my client
entered into a contract

488
00:20:40,642 --> 00:20:41,842
with a man that was
aware enough to realize

489
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:43,410
that he had a good hand,

490
00:20:43,478 --> 00:20:45,512
aware enough to ask for help,

491
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:47,014
aware enough to sign
a piece of paper

492
00:20:47,082 --> 00:20:49,850
for the sole purpose of winning
a large pot of money,

493
00:20:49,918 --> 00:20:51,318
and now he's mad he lost.

494
00:20:51,386 --> 00:20:53,787
Our client has
a history of drinking

495
00:20:53,855 --> 00:20:55,556
and has agreed
to be placed into rehab.

496
00:20:55,623 --> 00:20:57,958
That has nothing
to do with this.

497
00:20:58,026 --> 00:20:59,560
That tape clearly shows
that Keith didn't

498
00:20:59,627 --> 00:21:02,062
make any of those decisions
while he was sober.

499
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:04,965
Maybe not. But you did.

500
00:21:05,033 --> 00:21:06,333
What?

501
00:21:06,401 --> 00:21:07,868
The next morning,
you came to my client

502
00:21:07,936 --> 00:21:10,170
and offered to pay him what
you'd owed him if you'd won.

503
00:21:10,238 --> 00:21:11,271
I don't care what he says

504
00:21:11,339 --> 00:21:12,873
about his client's
state of mind,

505
00:21:12,941 --> 00:21:15,409
he was stone-cold sober.
Which clearly demonstrates

506
00:21:15,477 --> 00:21:17,644
they were perfectly happy
with the terms of the contract.

507
00:21:17,712 --> 00:21:19,613
Your Honor,
those were settlement talks,

508
00:21:19,681 --> 00:21:21,915
not subject to disclosure here.

509
00:21:21,983 --> 00:21:23,484
Mr. Specter, you're asking me

510
00:21:23,551 --> 00:21:25,919
to dismiss this contract
without a trial.

511
00:21:25,987 --> 00:21:28,755
Let's have it.

512
00:21:28,823 --> 00:21:31,458
Yes, I made an offer.

513
00:21:31,526 --> 00:21:34,695
Then I'm sorry, counselor,
I'm not ruling for dismissal.

514
00:21:34,762 --> 00:21:36,797
This goes forward to trial.

515
00:21:47,001 --> 00:21:48,402
This guy is pissing me off.

516
00:21:48,469 --> 00:21:50,604
Yeah, he's really good.
Kind of inspiring, actually.

517
00:21:50,672 --> 00:21:51,805
You trying to piss me off more?

518
00:21:51,873 --> 00:21:54,274
Yeah, it focuses you.
It's what you do to me.

519
00:21:54,342 --> 00:21:55,442
Yeah, I do that
because you don't have

520
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:57,878
a natural killer instinct.
Yes, I do.

521
00:21:57,946 --> 00:21:59,379
Good, because
I need you to use it.

522
00:21:59,447 --> 00:22:00,681
See what I did there?

523
00:22:00,748 --> 00:22:02,049
Yeah. What's our end game?

524
00:22:02,116 --> 00:22:03,951
Interim control of the company.

525
00:22:04,018 --> 00:22:05,819
Possession is 9/10 of the law.

526
00:22:05,887 --> 00:22:07,621
Whoever is in control
in the interim

527
00:22:07,689 --> 00:22:09,389
is likely to be
in control in the end.

528
00:22:09,457 --> 00:22:10,457
Plus, if we're
in the driver's seat,

529
00:22:10,525 --> 00:22:11,959
we can drag
this trial out forever.

530
00:22:12,026 --> 00:22:13,727
And we can do anything
we want in the meantime.

531
00:22:13,795 --> 00:22:14,995
By the time this is over,

532
00:22:15,063 --> 00:22:17,264
he won't even get back
his $3 million in chips.

533
00:22:17,332 --> 00:22:18,365
What do you need me to do?

534
00:22:18,433 --> 00:22:19,599
Find out everything
there is to know

535
00:22:19,667 --> 00:22:20,767
about this Tommy guy

536
00:22:20,835 --> 00:22:22,502
and get his ass in here
for a deposition.

537
00:22:22,570 --> 00:22:25,706
On it.

538
00:22:25,773 --> 00:22:27,808
Louis, I finished.

539
00:22:27,875 --> 00:22:29,977
You were here all night?

540
00:22:30,044 --> 00:22:31,445
You said you wanted everything
by this morning,

541
00:22:31,512 --> 00:22:33,680
so here's everything
on the lease agreements

542
00:22:33,748 --> 00:22:35,148
and all of the financials.

543
00:22:35,216 --> 00:22:37,484
Oh, no, Sergei waltzed me
through the financials earlier.

544
00:22:37,552 --> 00:22:38,885
Did you know that
he danced with Nureyev?

545
00:22:38,953 --> 00:22:41,888
I did. Um, also...

546
00:22:41,956 --> 00:22:44,858
I found this.

547
00:22:46,427 --> 00:22:49,997
Lead paint?

548
00:22:50,064 --> 00:22:52,666
Okay, this is... excellent.

549
00:22:52,734 --> 00:22:54,768
- You can use it?
- "Use it"?

550
00:22:54,836 --> 00:22:58,038
We are gonna pas de deux
all over their asses with it.

551
00:22:58,106 --> 00:23:00,040
"We"?

552
00:23:03,911 --> 00:23:06,546
- Get out.
- Okay.

553
00:23:19,494 --> 00:23:21,561
Here to buy me a drink?

554
00:23:21,629 --> 00:23:23,363
That didn't go so well
for me last time.

555
00:23:23,431 --> 00:23:26,566
No. No, I'm here
same as everyone else,

556
00:23:26,634 --> 00:23:29,369
to contribute to
your reelection campaign.

557
00:23:29,437 --> 00:23:30,637
Actually, I already did.

558
00:23:30,705 --> 00:23:33,607
Pearson Hardman is
now a platinum-level donor.

559
00:23:33,674 --> 00:23:35,976
Go, Follman.

560
00:23:36,044 --> 00:23:37,744
I know what you're doing.

561
00:23:37,812 --> 00:23:39,479
Of course, you don't have
to disclose this,

562
00:23:39,547 --> 00:23:40,814
and neither do we,

563
00:23:40,882 --> 00:23:44,684
but I am of the opinion
that elections are about truth,

564
00:23:44,752 --> 00:23:46,920
and truth requires openness.

565
00:23:49,123 --> 00:23:50,724
You think
you can get me to recuse

566
00:23:50,792 --> 00:23:52,726
by implying
a conflict of interest?

567
00:23:52,794 --> 00:23:54,094
You know,
I hadn't thought of that.

568
00:23:54,162 --> 00:23:55,996
I'll simply return the money.

569
00:23:56,064 --> 00:23:57,531
That is certainly
your prerogative.

570
00:23:57,598 --> 00:24:01,401
But it could look like
you took money for favors

571
00:24:01,469 --> 00:24:03,770
and then got scared.

572
00:24:03,838 --> 00:24:05,906
No one forced liquor
down your throat, Ella.

573
00:24:05,973 --> 00:24:09,042
You got drunk,
we played a bad joke,

574
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:11,411
but that was a long time ago.

575
00:24:11,479 --> 00:24:14,047
You know, a man's reputation
is at stake,

576
00:24:14,115 --> 00:24:17,184
and I'm not
joking with you now.

577
00:24:17,251 --> 00:24:19,686
Cheers.

578
00:24:24,525 --> 00:24:27,761
Lastly, section 5,
page 30 states

579
00:24:27,829 --> 00:24:29,096
that the Royal Hall
is responsible

580
00:24:29,163 --> 00:24:31,298
for all maintenance and repairs
of the rehearsal space.

581
00:24:31,365 --> 00:24:32,966
I'm aware of what
the lease says, Mr. Litt,

582
00:24:33,034 --> 00:24:34,267
having drafted it myself.

583
00:24:34,335 --> 00:24:35,735
Okay, well, then
how do you explain this?

584
00:24:35,803 --> 00:24:37,304
The Royal Hall's
knowing failure to fix

585
00:24:37,371 --> 00:24:40,574
the air conditioning system
has created a toxic environment.

586
00:24:40,641 --> 00:24:41,975
Lead-based paint.

587
00:24:42,043 --> 00:24:44,811
See, your disregard
for the safety of your charges

588
00:24:44,879 --> 00:24:47,114
takes it from a tenant dispute
to a criminal action,

589
00:24:47,181 --> 00:24:48,248
a fact that
I will happily bring

590
00:24:48,316 --> 00:24:49,449
to the attention
of the district attorney

591
00:24:49,517 --> 00:24:51,451
unless repairs
are made yesterday.

592
00:24:51,519 --> 00:24:53,920
Then you'll be exposing
the ballet itself

593
00:24:53,988 --> 00:24:56,590
because the terms require
they cover all repairs

594
00:24:56,657 --> 00:25:00,494
from a special fund they
stopped paying into a year ago.

595
00:25:00,561 --> 00:25:02,295
No, no, no, no, payments have
been going out every month.

596
00:25:02,363 --> 00:25:03,864
Then perhaps
you should figure out

597
00:25:03,931 --> 00:25:07,434
where they've been going in
because it's not here.

598
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:10,770
I'm sorry. I don't understand.

599
00:25:10,838 --> 00:25:12,639
Our financial records say...
Mr. Litt,

600
00:25:12,707 --> 00:25:14,207
we were willing
to look the other way,

601
00:25:14,275 --> 00:25:16,643
but since you have come in here
and threatened me,

602
00:25:16,711 --> 00:25:19,546
I'm going to take
legal action of my own.

603
00:25:19,614 --> 00:25:21,548
We'll be filing for eviction.

604
00:25:21,616 --> 00:25:23,550
It's time the ballet moves on.

605
00:25:33,094 --> 00:25:35,896
Can you tell me what
this is exactly, Mr. Walsh?

606
00:25:35,963 --> 00:25:37,164
I don't know.

607
00:25:37,231 --> 00:25:38,498
If I told you
it was a yaw drive,

608
00:25:38,566 --> 00:25:41,134
would that mean
anything to you?

609
00:25:41,202 --> 00:25:44,538
A yaw drive keeps the rotor
facing the right way,

610
00:25:44,605 --> 00:25:46,106
even when
the wind direction changes.

611
00:25:46,174 --> 00:25:49,442
If you have a problem with this,
you're not getting any power.

612
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:51,244
I'm sorry, where exactly
did you study engineering?

613
00:25:51,312 --> 00:25:52,779
I didn't.

614
00:25:52,847 --> 00:25:55,415
But you're suggesting that
you can run an energy company.

615
00:25:55,483 --> 00:25:57,017
My client's
gonna be running it,

616
00:25:57,084 --> 00:25:58,685
not designing parts.

617
00:25:58,753 --> 00:26:00,754
Well, does your client
have any idea

618
00:26:00,821 --> 00:26:05,158
how to protect the company
from the numerous allegations

619
00:26:05,226 --> 00:26:06,927
made by the Jarvis
Homeowners Association?

620
00:26:06,994 --> 00:26:08,428
Are you even
aware of these allegations?

621
00:26:08,496 --> 00:26:10,197
I haven't taken over
the company yet, Mr. Specter.

622
00:26:10,264 --> 00:26:12,132
Well, let me explain
something to you.

623
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,501
My client's company
needs to remain viable

624
00:26:14,569 --> 00:26:15,936
during the course
of this trial,

625
00:26:16,003 --> 00:26:19,039
and these allegations are
a threat to its very existence.

626
00:26:19,106 --> 00:26:21,007
And I don't think someone
who doesn't know the difference

627
00:26:21,075 --> 00:26:23,210
between a yaw drive
and a carburetor

628
00:26:23,277 --> 00:26:25,378
is the man for the job.
He's right.

629
00:26:25,446 --> 00:26:27,547
I don't know
anything about energy.

630
00:26:27,615 --> 00:26:29,015
And I'll tell you
something else:

631
00:26:29,083 --> 00:26:32,018
I also know very little
about ice cream.

632
00:26:32,086 --> 00:26:34,087
Yeah, I mean, I enjoy vanilla,

633
00:26:34,155 --> 00:26:35,989
but beyond that, nothing.

634
00:26:36,057 --> 00:26:37,891
Vanilla... could've guessed.

635
00:26:37,959 --> 00:26:39,960
I assume you have a point.

636
00:26:40,027 --> 00:26:41,595
I don't know anything
about any of the companies

637
00:26:41,662 --> 00:26:42,862
that I've turned around.

638
00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:45,899
But I don't have to
because I hire experts

639
00:26:45,967 --> 00:26:47,968
to advise me on operating them.

640
00:26:48,035 --> 00:26:50,470
And the one thing all
these experts have in common

641
00:26:50,538 --> 00:26:52,539
is that none of them
has a drinking problem.

642
00:26:52,607 --> 00:26:54,541
- Your Honor...
- He raised the issue.

643
00:26:54,609 --> 00:26:56,810
His client... and I quote...

644
00:26:56,877 --> 00:26:59,145
"has a history of drinking"
and was, in fact,

645
00:26:59,213 --> 00:27:01,881
so intoxicated that night
that his own lawyers

646
00:27:01,949 --> 00:27:04,884
had to place him to rehab.
He disputed that.

647
00:27:04,952 --> 00:27:06,553
That is not
the subject of this hearing.

648
00:27:06,621 --> 00:27:08,488
- Your Honor, he's trying to...
- I know what he's trying to do.

649
00:27:08,556 --> 00:27:10,523
He's using
your words against you.

650
00:27:10,591 --> 00:27:12,859
But they are your words,
Mr. Specter.

651
00:27:12,927 --> 00:27:16,429
The issue of the napkin contract
will be heard at trial,

652
00:27:16,497 --> 00:27:19,266
but in the interim,
Thomas Walsh

653
00:27:19,333 --> 00:27:22,469
will assume control
of the company.

654
00:27:33,052 --> 00:27:34,206
Thank you.

655
00:27:34,231 --> 00:27:35,504
This is just wrong.

656
00:27:35,505 --> 00:27:37,006
I know, this ruling
doesn't make any sense.

657
00:27:37,074 --> 00:27:38,774
No, I meant this.

658
00:27:38,842 --> 00:27:40,609
- The hot dog is wrong?
- It's a truck.

659
00:27:40,677 --> 00:27:41,944
This is New York.

660
00:27:42,012 --> 00:27:45,448
I want a cart, a vendor,
or a vague sense of danger,

661
00:27:45,515 --> 00:27:47,349
that the hot dog might
be made of anything.

662
00:27:47,417 --> 00:27:48,784
Okay, well, I think
I saw some cats

663
00:27:48,852 --> 00:27:49,985
lurking out behind the truck.

664
00:27:50,053 --> 00:27:53,656
Stop trying
to make me feel better.

665
00:27:53,724 --> 00:27:55,458
Not so bad.
All right, street meat,

666
00:27:55,525 --> 00:27:56,592
you wanna talk
about what just happened?

667
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:57,860
No, I don't.

668
00:27:57,928 --> 00:27:59,462
You said whoever's in control
in the interim...

669
00:27:59,529 --> 00:28:01,931
- I know what I said.
- So what's the other 1/10?

670
00:28:01,998 --> 00:28:03,199
What are you talking about?

671
00:28:03,266 --> 00:28:04,900
You said possession
is 9/10 of the law.

672
00:28:04,968 --> 00:28:07,169
So I figure we need
the other 1/10, right?

673
00:28:07,237 --> 00:28:09,071
- We're not gonna win this.
- What?

674
00:28:09,139 --> 00:28:11,040
- We don't have him.
- It's a 10% chance,

675
00:28:11,108 --> 00:28:13,042
but it's still a chance.
I mean, the odds are...

676
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:14,043
I'm not talking about the odds,

677
00:28:14,111 --> 00:28:15,745
I'm talking about the man.

678
00:28:15,812 --> 00:28:16,946
Wow, I've never heard you say

679
00:28:17,013 --> 00:28:18,614
another lawyer's
better than you before.

680
00:28:18,682 --> 00:28:20,483
He's not,
he's just got a better hand,

681
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:23,085
and he knows it.

682
00:28:23,153 --> 00:28:25,421
- What if we play a new hand?
- I'm listening.

683
00:28:25,489 --> 00:28:27,323
You're always talking
about this gun

684
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:29,692
being pointed at your head.

685
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,761
What if we take off our jacket

686
00:28:31,828 --> 00:28:34,964
and show them that we have
a bomb strapped to our chest?

687
00:28:35,031 --> 00:28:37,166
It's a metaphor, metaphor.

688
00:28:44,474 --> 00:28:47,676
- You wanted to see me?
- It was Sergei.

689
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:49,545
He lied to me.

690
00:28:49,613 --> 00:28:52,014
The money went
into his account.

691
00:28:52,082 --> 00:28:53,549
There's no way
that you could have...

692
00:28:53,617 --> 00:28:57,086
What, known?
It's my job to know.

693
00:28:57,154 --> 00:29:00,790
God, I never take anyone
at their word.

694
00:29:00,857 --> 00:29:02,525
You know I was eight years old

695
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:04,160
when I saw him perform
<i>The Nutcracker?</i>

696
00:29:04,227 --> 00:29:06,662
Eight.

697
00:29:06,730 --> 00:29:10,432
Everybody else was into sports,
and I was this rebel,

698
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,568
gliding down my own path.

699
00:29:12,636 --> 00:29:14,003
He inspired me.

700
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:15,871
That's why I'm
so light on my feet.

701
00:29:15,939 --> 00:29:17,439
I just can't do it to him.

702
00:29:17,507 --> 00:29:18,974
I cannot do it to him, Rachel.

703
00:29:19,042 --> 00:29:20,643
He <i>is</i> the ballet.

704
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:23,646
No, the ballet
is bigger than Sergei.

705
00:29:26,516 --> 00:29:29,585
It embodies our emotions,

706
00:29:29,653 --> 00:29:32,755
it is breathtaking
in its beauty,

707
00:29:32,823 --> 00:29:34,924
and most importantly,

708
00:29:34,991 --> 00:29:37,960
it expresses what cannot
be put into words.

709
00:29:38,028 --> 00:29:40,930
- Yes, but...
- No buts.

710
00:29:40,997 --> 00:29:44,166
The Louis I know wouldn't be
defeated by something like this.

711
00:29:44,234 --> 00:29:47,670
He is ruthless. He is mean.

712
00:29:47,737 --> 00:29:50,973
And if someone wronged him,
he wouldn't hesitate

713
00:29:51,041 --> 00:29:53,976
to tear them apart
limb from limb.

714
00:30:03,653 --> 00:30:05,154
You ruined everything.
I took your help,

715
00:30:05,222 --> 00:30:06,188
and now we're evicted!
I want to...

716
00:30:06,256 --> 00:30:07,723
Shut up, Sergei.

717
00:30:07,791 --> 00:30:10,092
- How dare you?
- Me?

718
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:13,195
You, you brought disgrace
on my beloved ballet.

719
00:30:13,263 --> 00:30:15,831
- I <i>am</i> the ballet.
- You were the ballet.

720
00:30:15,899 --> 00:30:17,032
And now you're done,

721
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:18,868
and the Royal Hall,
they've been paid.

722
00:30:18,935 --> 00:30:20,936
How?

723
00:30:21,004 --> 00:30:22,204
I reorganized accounts,
moved money.

724
00:30:22,272 --> 00:30:23,505
I did what I do.

725
00:30:23,573 --> 00:30:25,374
I showed them how
they can pay for everything

726
00:30:25,442 --> 00:30:28,410
by eliminating
your bloated salary.

727
00:30:30,513 --> 00:30:31,847
Well,

728
00:30:31,915 --> 00:30:33,315
the board would never agree,
so it's ridiculous.

729
00:30:33,383 --> 00:30:35,584
Oh, please, stop.
It's why they're here, Sergei.

730
00:30:35,652 --> 00:30:37,152
This isn't about the eviction.

731
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:38,621
They know what you've done.

732
00:30:38,688 --> 00:30:40,322
They want to see your face
when they tell you you're fired.

733
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:44,059
But I'm giving you one chance
to avoid scandal.

734
00:30:44,127 --> 00:30:45,728
My leaving is a scandal.

735
00:30:45,795 --> 00:30:47,096
Your leaving is a gift.

736
00:30:47,163 --> 00:30:48,931
Take it before
I change my mind.

737
00:30:59,709 --> 00:31:01,443
You wanted to see me?

738
00:31:01,511 --> 00:31:04,213
That was a good speech.

739
00:31:06,082 --> 00:31:07,750
Got me right here.

740
00:31:07,817 --> 00:31:10,653
The only thing is,
you said, <i>"we</i> played a joke."

741
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,222
There was no "we." It was you.

742
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:15,758
You targeted me.
What do you want me to say?

743
00:31:15,825 --> 00:31:20,496
I was young, I was stupid,
and I'm sorry.

744
00:31:20,563 --> 00:31:23,766
You were young and smart,

745
00:31:23,833 --> 00:31:25,968
and I don't believe
you're sorry for a second

746
00:31:26,036 --> 00:31:29,505
because it was no accident
that the classroom you chose

747
00:31:29,572 --> 00:31:31,006
belonged to the Professor

748
00:31:31,074 --> 00:31:32,808
who was conducting
the interviews

749
00:31:32,876 --> 00:31:35,044
for the job we both wanted.

750
00:31:36,846 --> 00:31:39,915
- I had no idea.
- You sabotaged me.

751
00:31:39,983 --> 00:31:42,451
There were
dozens of applicants.

752
00:31:42,519 --> 00:31:44,119
No, we both know
it was you or me.

753
00:31:44,187 --> 00:31:46,522
- I didn't know that he...
- Objection.

754
00:31:46,589 --> 00:31:49,458
Bullshit.

755
00:31:49,526 --> 00:31:51,694
What do you want, Ella?

756
00:31:51,761 --> 00:31:54,830
I want to recuse myself.

757
00:31:54,898 --> 00:31:57,266
On one condition:

758
00:31:59,336 --> 00:32:01,437
Admit you know what you did.

759
00:32:06,443 --> 00:32:08,610
I wanted that job.

760
00:32:08,678 --> 00:32:10,512
I know what I did.

761
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:14,383
I'm not sorry I did it.

762
00:32:14,451 --> 00:32:17,786
And I'd do it again.

763
00:32:28,531 --> 00:32:29,531
You look confused.

764
00:32:29,599 --> 00:32:31,667
I am.

765
00:32:31,735 --> 00:32:34,003
About what?

766
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:37,473
I...like Louis.

767
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:39,508
Trust me, I've been there.

768
00:32:39,576 --> 00:32:43,078
Doesn't last.

769
00:32:43,146 --> 00:32:46,081
Oh, my God. Is that...

770
00:32:48,385 --> 00:32:50,119
is that Louis' dictaphone?

771
00:32:50,186 --> 00:32:51,754
Oh, yeah, I needed it

772
00:32:51,821 --> 00:32:54,089
to transcribe the notes
for the ballet case.

773
00:32:54,157 --> 00:32:55,424
Do you have any idea
what this means?

774
00:32:55,492 --> 00:32:59,395
Rachel, this is a window
into the mind of Louis Litt.

775
00:32:59,462 --> 00:33:01,397
It's a dictaphone.

776
00:33:01,464 --> 00:33:03,032
That he treats
like his best friend.

777
00:33:03,099 --> 00:33:04,566
- Mike.
- Ahh... come on, gotta try it.

778
00:33:04,634 --> 00:33:07,936
Goal number seven:
Perfect the British accent.

779
00:33:08,004 --> 00:33:09,938
Hey, top of the morning, mate.

780
00:33:10,006 --> 00:33:11,473
Would ya like
some tea and crumpets?

781
00:33:11,541 --> 00:33:12,641
- Yes!
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

782
00:33:12,709 --> 00:33:14,143
We really...
we really shouldn't.

783
00:33:14,210 --> 00:33:16,278
Oh, no, but I think
we really, really should.

784
00:33:16,346 --> 00:33:18,881
Come up with a catchphrase.
Injunct this.

785
00:33:18,948 --> 00:33:20,482
Hey, Harold, injunct this.

786
00:33:20,550 --> 00:33:22,084
This is insane.

787
00:33:22,152 --> 00:33:23,485
Insanely awesome.

788
00:33:23,553 --> 00:33:24,853
You just got Litt up.

789
00:33:24,921 --> 00:33:27,423
Excuse me, Miss Zane,
you just got Litt up.

790
00:33:27,490 --> 00:33:30,259
- Oh, no, Rachel.
- No, no, no! Enough.

791
00:33:30,326 --> 00:33:32,194
- No, you just got Litt up.
- I feel dirty.

792
00:33:32,262 --> 00:33:33,896
Wait, wait,
this is a gold mine.

793
00:33:33,963 --> 00:33:35,998
One more, come on.

794
00:33:36,066 --> 00:33:38,267
They're settling?
You wanted that?

795
00:33:38,334 --> 00:33:40,102
Wanted it?
I goddamn orchestrated it.

796
00:33:40,170 --> 00:33:41,937
CM plays what they should have
in the first place,

797
00:33:42,005 --> 00:33:43,372
and the suit
against us goes away.

798
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,107
And Daniel Hardman's
none the wiser.

799
00:33:45,175 --> 00:33:48,277
Where the hell is Donna?

800
00:33:48,344 --> 00:33:51,013
He recorded us.

801
00:33:51,081 --> 00:33:52,714
He must have planted this
in Harvey's office.

802
00:33:52,782 --> 00:33:55,384
No, th... that's horrible.

803
00:33:55,452 --> 00:33:57,019
- That's why he turned on me.
- Wait a minute.

804
00:33:57,087 --> 00:33:58,487
What are you going to do?
I don't know.

805
00:33:58,555 --> 00:34:01,523
But if I tell Harvey about this,
he is gonna kill Louis.

806
00:34:03,893 --> 00:34:05,094
Come on, let's go.
They're in the conference room.

807
00:34:05,161 --> 00:34:06,962
- Okay.
- Everything all right?

808
00:34:07,030 --> 00:34:08,764
Uh, yeah, no.

809
00:34:08,832 --> 00:34:10,232
Did you get
that power of attorney?

810
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:12,034
Yeah. Let's go
set off that bomb.

811
00:34:12,102 --> 00:34:14,036
Thanks.

812
00:34:19,109 --> 00:34:21,643
By the way, where did you
find that yaw drive anyway?

813
00:34:21,711 --> 00:34:25,481
Pulled it out
of the back of a photocopier.

814
00:34:25,548 --> 00:34:28,283
Gentlemen, as you are
now in control of the company,

815
00:34:28,351 --> 00:34:30,486
we thought it best to bring
a problem to your attention.

816
00:34:30,553 --> 00:34:32,387
How selfless of you.

817
00:34:32,455 --> 00:34:33,889
These are amended copies
of the allegations

818
00:34:33,957 --> 00:34:36,358
against your company by the
Jarvis Homeowners Association.

819
00:34:36,426 --> 00:34:38,894
Nice try.
I looked into those allegations.

820
00:34:38,962 --> 00:34:41,396
Not a single expert has backed
one of their claims.

821
00:34:41,464 --> 00:34:43,699
- Well, one has now.
- Keith Hoyt.

822
00:34:43,766 --> 00:34:45,501
Who better to speak
to the harmful effects

823
00:34:45,568 --> 00:34:48,737
than the man who designed
the wind farm himself?

824
00:34:48,805 --> 00:34:50,539
No, no, if he
goes through with this,

825
00:34:50,607 --> 00:34:51,974
that company
goes out of business.

826
00:34:52,041 --> 00:34:53,642
There's no way he kills
his own company.

827
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:55,210
You're right, he wouldn't.

828
00:34:55,278 --> 00:34:58,013
But I would,
and as you pointed out,

829
00:34:58,081 --> 00:35:00,315
Keith's judgment
has been impaired lately,

830
00:35:00,383 --> 00:35:01,483
so I convinced him to let me

831
00:35:01,551 --> 00:35:03,218
make the decisions
going forward.

832
00:35:03,286 --> 00:35:05,053
I now have power of attorney,

833
00:35:05,121 --> 00:35:07,122
and I'd rather see
this company worth nothing

834
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:10,659
than let you have it.

835
00:35:10,727 --> 00:35:12,728
- This is bullshit.
- Let him finish.

836
00:35:12,795 --> 00:35:15,664
Something's coming.

837
00:35:15,732 --> 00:35:17,866
We have three choices here.

838
00:35:17,934 --> 00:35:21,069
We move forward with the suit...
lose-lose...

839
00:35:21,137 --> 00:35:24,506
we can give you your money back,
plus the $500,000,

840
00:35:24,574 --> 00:35:28,177
or you and I
can play poker for it.

841
00:35:28,244 --> 00:35:30,179
And I'm not giving you
your money back.

842
00:35:36,786 --> 00:35:38,253
Are you crazy?

843
00:35:38,321 --> 00:35:40,155
You're gonna gamble
a man's company?

844
00:35:40,223 --> 00:35:42,624
What, no, you're gonna
gamble for $30 million?

845
00:35:42,692 --> 00:35:44,159
It was your idea.

846
00:35:44,227 --> 00:35:46,428
No, it was my idea
to make him take the $500,000.

847
00:35:46,495 --> 00:35:49,297
But it's not $500,000,
it's $3.5 million.

848
00:35:49,365 --> 00:35:51,233
Why give him that when
I could take it for free?

849
00:35:52,868 --> 00:35:55,303
Okay.

850
00:35:55,371 --> 00:35:57,105
But let me take it.

851
00:35:57,173 --> 00:35:59,641
What? A minute ago,
you were ready to fold.

852
00:35:59,709 --> 00:36:01,376
What are you gonna do
if he goes all in?

853
00:36:01,444 --> 00:36:02,744
Harvey, I know
the odds of every card

854
00:36:02,812 --> 00:36:04,279
in every hand
before it's even dealt.

855
00:36:04,347 --> 00:36:06,581
Pick a card in your mind,
any card.

856
00:36:06,649 --> 00:36:09,050
Wh.

857
00:36:09,118 --> 00:36:11,253
Okay, what, now you're gonna
tell me what the card is?

858
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:12,520
I'm gonna tell you
what it isn't.

859
00:36:12,588 --> 00:36:14,956
It's not one of
the 52 cards in a deck

860
00:36:15,024 --> 00:36:16,524
because you think
you're smarter than me.

861
00:36:16,592 --> 00:36:18,193
It's a baseball card

862
00:36:18,261 --> 00:36:22,597
or football card or...

863
00:36:22,665 --> 00:36:25,634
It's the joker.

864
00:36:25,701 --> 00:36:27,969
I told you this before.
I'm gonna tell you again.

865
00:36:28,037 --> 00:36:31,273
I don't play the odds.
I play the man.

866
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:33,441
Well, let me
tell you one thing.

867
00:36:33,509 --> 00:36:36,311
- What?
- Louis bugged your office.

868
00:36:36,379 --> 00:36:39,014
He heard our whole conversation
about Tanner's lawsuit,

869
00:36:39,081 --> 00:36:40,448
and then he ran,
and he told Hardman.

870
00:36:40,516 --> 00:36:43,018
You just saying that
to make me mad, so I can focus?

871
00:36:48,924 --> 00:36:50,592
You're not the only one
who can play the man.

872
00:37:00,903 --> 00:37:03,438
You really think
you can handle me?

873
00:37:03,506 --> 00:37:05,273
Oh, I think I'll be just fine.

874
00:37:05,341 --> 00:37:07,208
'Cause this isn't
Sunday afternoon bridge

875
00:37:07,276 --> 00:37:09,077
with your grandmother.

876
00:37:09,145 --> 00:37:10,945
I don't see how that's
an insult to a person.

877
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:16,851
I'll just keep dealing.

878
00:37:34,870 --> 00:37:37,972
Look, we're supposed to play
until one of us is busted,

879
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:41,743
even if it takes all night,
but you know what?

880
00:37:41,811 --> 00:37:44,779
I don't have all night.

881
00:37:44,847 --> 00:37:46,881
Who's the grandmother now?

882
00:37:46,949 --> 00:37:48,883
Better.

883
00:37:52,188 --> 00:37:53,955
He can't help you.

884
00:37:54,023 --> 00:37:55,523
But I do know why
you're looking to him.

885
00:37:55,591 --> 00:37:57,892
You see, I looked into you.

886
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:00,195
You say you're a self-made man.

887
00:38:00,262 --> 00:38:02,564
Your ex-wife
had a different story

888
00:38:02,631 --> 00:38:04,466
when she told me
why she left you.

889
00:38:04,533 --> 00:38:06,201
She said you had
a chip on your shoulder

890
00:38:06,268 --> 00:38:08,436
because everything you ever got
came from daddy.

891
00:38:08,504 --> 00:38:10,905
Now, you may not think
this is true anymore.

892
00:38:10,973 --> 00:38:12,807
You said yourself,
you're not an expert.

893
00:38:12,875 --> 00:38:14,776
But you hire them
to advise you,

894
00:38:14,844 --> 00:38:17,746
run your companies,
and fight your battles.

895
00:38:17,813 --> 00:38:22,183
Tonight, it's you, me,
and that stack of chips.

896
00:38:22,251 --> 00:38:24,185
Let's play.

897
00:38:46,942 --> 00:38:48,576
You think you can
bait me into calling you

898
00:38:48,644 --> 00:38:51,579
when you got me beat?

899
00:38:55,684 --> 00:38:57,318
You're gonna have
to do better than that.

900
00:38:57,386 --> 00:39:01,790
You're right, Tommy,
I do have you beat.

901
00:39:01,857 --> 00:39:04,392
But these shity cards,

902
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:07,729
they don't have
anything to do with it.

903
00:39:13,569 --> 00:39:15,370
After that, he was on tilt,
never recovered.

904
00:39:15,438 --> 00:39:16,871
Took me 20 minutes to bust him.

905
00:39:16,939 --> 00:39:18,106
Are you out
of your goddamn mind?

906
00:39:18,174 --> 00:39:19,374
How fast did you
want me to beat him?

907
00:39:19,442 --> 00:39:20,809
That's not what I meant,
and you know it.

908
00:39:20,876 --> 00:39:22,844
You're out of control.
I'm fine.

909
00:39:22,912 --> 00:39:25,113
Fine? Let me
connect the dots for you.

910
00:39:25,181 --> 00:39:26,648
Donna's gone.

911
00:39:26,715 --> 00:39:28,850
You took Mike to a casino,

912
00:39:28,918 --> 00:39:30,385
and two days later,
you're gambling

913
00:39:30,453 --> 00:39:33,121
with a client's
$30 million company.

914
00:39:33,189 --> 00:39:34,622
I wasn't gambling,
I was playing poker.

915
00:39:34,690 --> 00:39:37,258
- Harvey, save it.
- Save it?

916
00:39:37,326 --> 00:39:39,594
Gambling is what you do when
you're playing against the house

917
00:39:39,662 --> 00:39:40,862
and hoping to get Blackjack.

918
00:39:40,930 --> 00:39:42,297
I'm playing against people,

919
00:39:42,364 --> 00:39:44,165
and against people, I win.

920
00:39:44,233 --> 00:39:46,067
In a back room card game,
that might be true,

921
00:39:46,135 --> 00:39:48,603
but you didn't know
anything about this guy.

922
00:39:48,671 --> 00:39:50,338
He could've been Phil Ivey
for all you know.

923
00:39:50,406 --> 00:39:52,207
You're gonna beat Phil Ivey?

924
00:39:52,274 --> 00:39:53,808
No, I did know,
and I was right.

925
00:39:53,876 --> 00:39:55,176
This time.

926
00:39:55,244 --> 00:39:56,911
But you know what else gambling

927
00:39:56,979 --> 00:39:59,447
and what you did
have in common?

928
00:39:59,515 --> 00:40:02,217
This.

929
00:40:02,284 --> 00:40:03,685
You think I didn't remember

930
00:40:03,752 --> 00:40:07,455
your "Life is this,
and I like this" speech?

931
00:40:07,523 --> 00:40:09,290
When you get that from your job,
it's one thing,

932
00:40:09,358 --> 00:40:11,426
but then you start chasing it.
No, I wasn't chasing it.

933
00:40:11,494 --> 00:40:13,027
We were going
to lose this in court.

934
00:40:13,095 --> 00:40:15,430
- Then lose.
- No! I am not...

935
00:40:15,498 --> 00:40:19,467
You're not what? A human being?

936
00:40:19,535 --> 00:40:22,537
We're people,
and sometimes we lose.

937
00:40:22,605 --> 00:40:23,805
Sometimes?

938
00:40:23,873 --> 00:40:25,306
Look, I don't know about you,

939
00:40:25,374 --> 00:40:27,442
but I feel like that's
all we've been doing lately.

940
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:31,045
Hardman's back, Donna's gone,
we're being sued...

941
00:40:31,113 --> 00:40:33,648
I mean, we're fighting
for our goddamn lives here.

942
00:40:33,716 --> 00:40:36,951
I just had a huge win,
and I am not in the mood to hear

943
00:40:37,019 --> 00:40:40,622
why it might have
turned out as a loss.

944
00:40:40,689 --> 00:40:44,626
Harvey...

945
00:40:44,693 --> 00:40:48,329
you're right.

946
00:40:48,397 --> 00:40:50,632
We are being sued,

947
00:40:50,699 --> 00:40:52,567
and our backs
are against the wall,

948
00:40:52,635 --> 00:40:55,036
and I need to know

949
00:40:55,104 --> 00:40:57,372
that this bullshit
is out of your system

950
00:40:57,439 --> 00:40:59,674
and that you can focus.

951
00:40:59,742 --> 00:41:01,376
Can you do that?

952
00:41:03,178 --> 00:41:05,947
I'm focused.

953
00:41:21,163 --> 00:41:22,363
I was...

954
00:41:22,431 --> 00:41:24,399
I don't give a shit
what you were doing.

955
00:41:24,466 --> 00:41:25,833
You know, Harvey, you can
make fun of me all you want,

956
00:41:25,901 --> 00:41:27,969
but watch your tone.

957
00:41:32,308 --> 00:41:36,077
What the hell is that?

958
00:41:36,145 --> 00:41:38,580
That's not yours.

959
00:41:38,647 --> 00:41:42,216
This is a violation
of my privacy.

960
00:41:42,284 --> 00:41:43,885
You know what,
I have a right to know

961
00:41:43,953 --> 00:41:46,854
what's going on at this firm,
just as much as you.

962
00:41:46,922 --> 00:41:49,624
Okay. Did you tell Jessica?

963
00:41:49,692 --> 00:41:51,259
There's gonna
come a day, Louis,

964
00:41:51,327 --> 00:41:52,860
when I need something from you,

965
00:41:52,928 --> 00:41:56,898
and when I do, you're gonna
remember that I let this pass.

966
00:41:56,966 --> 00:42:00,134
Daniel Hardman
is not the answer.

967
00:42:00,202 --> 00:42:02,904
You owe me.
