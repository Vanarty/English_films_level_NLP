<i>On the 5th day of November, 1699,

14
00:03:40,304 --> 00:03:43,891
All's well!

15
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:50,731
All's well!

16
00:03:55,152 --> 00:03:59,656
# All's well! What's a rainy day? #

17
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:00,991
# Never mind that cloud. #

18
00:04:01,033 --> 00:04:04,494
# Behind that cloud you'll find a golden ray. #

19
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:09,082
# All's well! Laugh your fears away. #

20
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:11,960
# See the light ahead. Right ahead. #

21
00:04:12,002 --> 00:04:14,338
# There's a moonlit night ahead. #

22
00:04:14,463 --> 00:04:19,760
# Everyone, come on have fun. All's well! #

23
00:04:20,511 --> 00:04:22,596
Why do they make me sing that song?

24
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:25,140
The poet who wrote it was certainly wrong.

25
00:04:25,349 --> 00:04:27,851
It's bright ahead. The light's ahead.

26
00:04:27,893 --> 00:04:31,271
I'd rather go home and go right to bed.

27
00:04:35,901 --> 00:04:39,363
All's well!

28
00:04:41,156 --> 00:04:43,700
My feet are wet and my bunions ache,

29
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:46,411
and yet I've to keep wide awake,

30
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:50,916
all night!

31
00:04:55,921 --> 00:05:00,676
I wake folks up to tell them
things are all right!

32
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:05,430
And, # All's well! What's a rainy day? #

33
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:06,974
# Never mind that cloud. #

34

00:05:20,195 --> 00:05:23,907
# Everyone, come on have fun. All...

39
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:53,187
A, A, All's well! Wha, wha, what's a rainy day?

40
00:07:05,676 --> 00:07:08,637
The king has visitors.

41
00:07:08,679 --> 00:07:11,139
Do you know they're signing a wedding contract?

42
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:13,350
There's a giant on the beach!

43
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:15,018
<i>There, there's a giant out there!

53
00:07:55,142 --> 00:07:57,561
Quite in order, fine.

54
00:07:57,769 --> 00:08:01,732
King Bombo!

55
00:08:29,468 --> 00:08:32,930
Well we did it, you little rascal, you.
We did it.

56
00:08:33,055 --> 00:08:35,265
Yes we, we certainly did, didn't we?

57
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:41,230
Just a couple of old dag cupids, I think! [laughs}

58
00:08:44,816 --> 00:08:49,112
Your majesty, the wedding things are here.

59
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:52,533
There's a giant on the beach!
Let me go!

60
00:09:08,549 --> 00:09:12,553
Let me go! Let me go!
There's a giant on the beach! Let me go!

61
00:09:22,271 --> 00:09:26,149
Exquisite taste, exquisite!

62
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:35,742
Roses, Freesia, Rhododendrons,
Ranunculus, Snap Dragons, and Daisies.

63
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:38,662
Ahh!

64
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:45,294
They're pretty Posies, aren't they?

65
00:09:45,377 --> 00:09:50,424
Beautiful blooms, beautiful!

66
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:02,811
Oh!

67
00:10:05,022 --> 00:10:05,898
May I?

68
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:11,153
Oh, please do!

69
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:21,872
Magnificent!

70
00:10:35,427 --> 00:10:41,308
Oh! A masterpiece!

71
00:10:51,443 --> 00:10:55,447
Vanilla. Wow!

72
00:10:57,115 --> 00:11:14,424
# Faithful. Remember, that whatever I do,
I'm always faithful, my love. #

73
00:11:15,676 --> 00:11:25,269
# Faithful, with all my soul and thankful for you, #

74
00:11:25,394 --> 00:11:34,236
# who came from heaven above. #

75
00:11:34,403 --> 00:11:46,331
# We'll dance tonight together,
on a world with me we'll find. #

76
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:49,334
My only little daughter. I dread losing her.

77
00:11:49,418 --> 00:11:55,257
Huh, Buck up there old boy, you're not
losing a daughter. You’re gaining a son.

78
00:11:56,925 --> 00:12:00,470
My son!

79
00:12:00,596 --> 00:12:21,992
# So I'll be faithful and faithful as I promise to be,
and you'll be for all mine. #

80
00:12:23,827 --> 00:12:27,164
Hmm. Lovely melody.

81
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:29,333
Yes, we like it.

82
00:12:29,374 --> 00:12:32,669
That is Faithful. The song of Lilliput.

83
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:35,756
It will be played at the wedding tomorrow.

84
00:12:35,881 --> 00:12:37,132
Of course. Of course.

85
00:12:37,549 --> 00:12:43,055
What's that, Faithful? Oh, no, no! Forever!

86
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:46,183
The song of Blefuscu must be
played at the wedding.

87
00:12:46,183 --> 00:12:50,687
But Bombo, Faithful is always
played at our weddings.

88
00:12:50,771 --> 00:12:55,609
It, it's tradition, sir. And it's very pretty.

89
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:59,363
Yes, yes, I know. Pleasant little ditty,

90
00:12:59,363 --> 00:13:02,783
oh but hardly appropriate for this great occasion.

91
00:13:02,824 --> 00:13:07,579
But Forever! There's a song for you! Ha, ha!

92
00:13:08,413 --> 00:13:10,082
Faithful will be played.

93
00:13:10,082 --> 00:13:14,920
Bah! Fodder. Absolute fodder. It must be Forever!

94
00:13:15,796 --> 00:13:18,757
Faithful.

95
00:13:18,841 --> 00:13:20,217
Forever!

96
00:13:20,217 --> 00:13:22,511
Faithful.

97
00:13:22,678 --> 00:13:25,138
Forever!

98
00:13:27,224 --> 00:13:29,643
Faithful.

99
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:38,110
It will be Forever, or there will be no wedding!

100
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:41,530
No wedding? But the cake
and the pretty flowers and..

101
00:13:41,613 --> 00:13:47,369
oh Bombo, you'll love Faithful.

102
00:13:53,584 --> 00:13:56,879
Ahh!

103
00:13:59,882 --> 00:14:04,928
It's war!

104
00:14:24,615 --> 00:14:27,409
There's a giant on the beach!

105
00:14:31,246 --> 00:14:36,126
It's war!

106
00:14:48,055 --> 00:14:52,184
War. Woe is me. Woe is me.

107
00:14:52,267 --> 00:14:55,687
I found a mountain, your majesty. I found it!
It was man, a man mountain!

108
00:14:55,812 --> 00:14:57,356
War isn't nice.

109
00:14:57,439 --> 00:14:58,899
It was, was this big!

110
00:14:58,941 --> 00:15:00,484
No, no. It was this big!

111
00:15:00,526 --> 00:15:02,653
People get hurt in wars.

112
00:15:02,736 --> 00:15:06,740
He's as big, as big as, as,.. big as, as, as..

113
00:15:06,865 --> 00:15:09,284
Wait your majesty!

114
00:15:09,284 --> 00:15:12,746
Bombo can't frighten me. No sir.

115
00:15:14,164 --> 00:15:16,500
Don't stand there like a nincompoop!

116
00:15:16,542 --> 00:15:19,753
I'm trying to tell you that there's a giant!

117
00:15:19,878 --> 00:15:24,216
When I get my dandruff up, then look out.

118
00:15:27,719 --> 00:15:35,352
But Glory, poor little Glory.

119
00:15:51,785 --> 00:15:55,789
Don't look now gentleman, but it's war.

120
00:15:55,873 --> 00:15:58,709
War? Whoopee!

121
00:16:00,627 --> 00:16:05,257
# Forever, forever, #

122
00:16:05,299 --> 00:16:10,345
# There won't be anyone but you. #

123
00:16:10,387 --> 00:16:19,563
# Remember I'm true, my sweet. #

124
00:16:19,563 --> 00:16:23,859
# Forever, forever, #

125
00:16:23,859 --> 00:16:28,822
# You'll share in everything I do, #

126
00:16:28,822 --> 00:16:37,080
# And keep smiling through, my sweet. #

127
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:46,298
# I'll have just you here in my heart, #

128
00:16:46,298 --> 00:16:54,431
# And I'll trust you though we're apart. #

129
00:16:54,473 --> 00:17:02,981
# So, forever, forever, #

130
00:17:03,106 --> 00:17:08,362
# My guiding angel you will be. #

131
00:17:08,362 --> 00:17:29,049
# So always have faith in me. #

132
00:17:43,146 --> 00:17:44,731
Shh!

133
00:17:45,482 --> 00:17:46,859
Shh!

134
00:17:47,109 --> 00:17:48,610
Shh!

135
00:17:57,077 --> 00:18:01,081
War. Ha. Ha. Rolls off my back like a duck.

136
00:18:01,123 --> 00:18:03,709
But, but I'm, but I'm trying to tell ya!

137
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,169
I'm telling ya there's, there's a...

138
00:18:05,169 --> 00:18:07,296
What's on your mind?

139
00:18:08,505 --> 00:18:09,256
I said..

140
00:18:09,298 --> 00:18:10,174
Speak up, man.

141
00:18:10,215 --> 00:18:14,219
There's a giant on the beach!
There's a giant on the beach!

142
00:18:14,344 --> 00:18:16,597
For heaven's sake, Gabby.
Button your mouth.

143
00:18:16,638 --> 00:18:18,473
Can't you see I have a war on my hands?

144
00:18:18,515 --> 00:18:20,475
Be off with you. Shoo! Shoo! Shoo! Shoo!

145
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:22,144
A war?

146
00:18:22,186 --> 00:18:25,272
Do you suppose he could be a, a spy?

147
00:18:27,941 --> 00:18:29,193
Who's a spy? Who's a spy?

148
00:18:29,193 --> 00:18:32,279
THE GIANT ON THE BEACH!

149
00:18:32,446 --> 00:18:34,990
A giant? Giant? Why don't you tell me things?

150
00:18:35,115 --> 00:18:37,451
Do something. Don't stand there.
Go. Sic the dogs on him.

151
00:18:37,451 --> 00:18:40,078
Fetch him to me at once!

152
00:18:41,622 --> 00:18:42,414
Wake up! Wake up!

153
00:18:42,497 --> 00:18:44,458
There's a giant on the beach!

Wake up! Wake up!

Wake up! Wake up!
There's a giant on the beach!

162
00:19:07,439 --> 00:19:09,358
A giant, on the beach?

163
00:19:09,399 --> 00:19:10,317
A giant?

164
00:19:10,317 --> 00:19:11,276
On the beach?

165
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,237
T-T-There's a, there's a, there's, there's a...

A giant on the beach!

171
00:19:19,952 --> 00:19:20,869
Giant!

172
00:19:20,869 --> 00:19:21,787
On the beach!

173
00:19:21,828 --> 00:19:26,250
I said, "There's a giant on the beach!"

174
00:19:32,589 --> 00:19:34,842
Bring cables and tools.
Bring horses and mules.

Bring snippers and clippers,

00:19:42,766 --> 00:19:44,268
And all kinds of things
and stuff like that there.

179
00:19:44,309 --> 00:19:45,811
Follow me!

180
00:20:28,562 --> 00:20:30,856
Shh!

181
00:20:32,983 --> 00:20:35,027
Shh!

182
00:20:35,861 --> 00:20:38,572
Shh!

183
00:20:44,244 --> 00:20:46,246
Hmm!

184
00:20:57,299 --> 00:21:04,181
Shh! Quiet. We're almost there.

185
00:21:23,075 --> 00:21:24,618
Whoaa!

186
00:21:25,244 --> 00:21:28,163
Wh, where, where is it?

187
00:21:28,872 --> 00:21:32,960
I don't know, but it was right here.

188
00:21:35,003 --> 00:21:36,421
Here?

189
00:21:36,505 --> 00:21:40,342
Oh yeah? Well where is it now?

190
00:21:40,384 --> 00:21:45,389
Well ah, ah, I can't understand it.
It was right here.

191
00:21:46,056 --> 00:21:49,017
Honest.

192
00:21:49,101 --> 00:21:53,480
Giant, huh! Dragging us out
into the dead of the night.

193
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,691
Yeah, chasing wild geese.

194
00:21:55,732 --> 00:21:58,610
Gabby must have been seeing things.

195
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:03,282
Maybe it just got up and flew away.

196
00:22:03,615 --> 00:22:07,703
Yeah, and breathing fire.

197
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:13,041
Look out Gabby.
Your giant's gonna bite ya!

198
00:22:14,501 --> 00:22:22,759
Hey, hey fellas, maybe it was me he saw.
Look. I'm a giant! I'm a giant!

199
00:22:40,319 --> 00:22:42,070
Psst!

200
00:22:44,198 --> 00:22:46,325
Psst! Psst! Psst!

201
00:22:48,243 --> 00:22:50,787
Listen.

202
00:23:41,213 --> 00:23:44,758
I-I... t-t-told ya that there was

203
00:23:44,967 --> 00:23:50,097
a-a-a gia, a giant on the b-b-beach.

204
00:23:50,264 --> 00:23:51,598
And well, there he is.

205
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:52,391
Huh?

206
00:23:52,766 --> 00:23:56,061
HE SAID, "THAT'S THE GIANT ON THE BEACH!"

207
00:23:56,103 --> 00:23:57,813
Shh!

208
00:23:58,105 --> 00:24:00,190
Shh!

209
00:24:00,357 --> 00:24:01,775
Shh!

210
00:24:01,817 --> 00:24:03,193
There isn't a moment to waste.

211
00:24:03,235 --> 00:24:05,362
Every last man must do all that he can.

212
00:24:05,404 --> 00:24:07,072
Work with the greatest of haste.

213
00:24:07,072 --> 00:24:11,034
So bind up its hands, its arms,
its chest, its neck, its feet!

214
00:24:11,368 --> 00:24:12,619
And I'll do the rest.

215
00:24:12,744 --> 00:24:15,205
Let's go!

216
00:24:39,313 --> 00:24:40,564
Quiet.

217
00:24:40,981 --> 00:24:43,317
Quiet.

218
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,152
Quiet.

219
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,280
Hey?

220
00:24:57,414 --> 00:25:00,375

00:26:25,544 --> 00:26:27,880
Careful!

222
00:26:27,921 --> 00:26:31,925
Up!

223
00:26:51,028 --> 00:26:54,823
Put him there! No! No! Here!
Don't be afraid man!

224
00:26:56,116 --> 00:27:00,037
Aw! Aw! He got me! He got me!
Aw! Aw! Help! He's killing me!

225
00:27:00,078 --> 00:27:03,248
I don't want to die! Help! Help!
He's killing me! Help!

226
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:04,625
Hey!

227
00:27:11,256 --> 00:27:16,762
Well, what are you rubes waiting for?
Tie him up!

228
00:28:57,988 --> 00:28:59,823
Get the wheel. Come on, roll in the plate.

00:28:59,823 --> 00:29:01,992
Bring pegs to hold him.
Bring jacks, tacks, cleats, axe.

00:29:02,075 --> 00:29:05,037
All kinds of things and stuff like that there!

Back up, Billy!

236
00:30:42,426 --> 00:30:44,595
Hip! Hip!

237
00:30:44,636 --> 00:30:45,721
Ho!

Lower wave in!

242
00:32:17,229 --> 00:32:21,859
Careful! Careful!

Oh! Oh! Oh!

Pull in the ropes there!

250
00:33:37,851 --> 00:33:41,396
Not so fast! Not so fast!
Hurry up, there! Slow down!

251
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,940
Get the wheels past!

252
00:33:43,023 --> 00:33:50,072
Phew! I don't know what they would do
around here without ME!

253
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:55,869
Ohhhh!

254
00:33:58,372 --> 00:34:01,291
Heave! Heave!

255
00:35:13,155 --> 00:35:20,078
Faithful was always played
at our weddings... Faithful.

256
00:35:25,334 --> 00:35:28,212
Faithful.

257
00:35:28,504 --> 00:35:32,090
Your, your, your majesty.

258
00:35:32,883 --> 00:35:34,468
Huh?

259
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:36,470
I've got the giant!

260
00:35:37,012 --> 00:35:43,060
The giant. Oh, yes, yes, the giant.
Well bring him in. Bring him in.

261
00:35:43,143 --> 00:35:45,395
Okay. Okay.

262
00:35:46,605 --> 00:35:50,275
Your majesty, I don't think he'd fit in here.

263
00:35:50,275 --> 00:35:54,696
Oh you don't, huh?
So it's not good enough for him, hmm?

264
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:58,534
Well where is he?

265
00:35:58,575 --> 00:36:00,994
Out there, your majesty.

266
00:36:06,875 --> 00:36:09,920
Now, then.

267
00:36:11,505 --> 00:36:15,717
Humph! Not good enough for him!

268
00:36:34,486 --> 00:36:37,614
Well, where is he?

269
00:36:39,157 --> 00:36:42,995
From here. On!

270
00:36:49,668 --> 00:36:55,799
Call out the guards, the army, the navy,
women and children first, I'll see you later.

271
00:37:28,999 --> 00:37:33,670
Search him, men. He may be armed.

272
00:38:58,839 --> 00:39:01,884
Ohhhh!

273
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:07,347
Ugh! Why do I get out held?

00:39:37,586 --> 00:39:41,715
Help! I won't taste good.
I'll give you indigestion.

281
00:39:41,757 --> 00:39:44,801
A man. A tiny man.

282
00:39:44,843 --> 00:39:47,971
You can't do this to me.
I've got a wife and kids.

283
00:39:48,013 --> 00:39:49,598
Millions of kids.

284
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:53,018
Hold on there, mate.
Nobody's going to hurt you.

285
00:39:53,101 --> 00:39:58,023
Help! Put me down! Help! Help!

286
00:39:59,149 --> 00:40:00,943
Drop that! Drop that!

287
00:40:01,777 --> 00:40:05,280
Well, another one. Who are you?

288
00:40:05,572 --> 00:40:09,493
Who me? What? I'm king around here.

289
00:40:09,826 --> 00:40:12,037
Guards! Guards! To the turrets!

290
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:17,292
Archers! Surround the giant!
Surround the giant! Guards!

291
00:40:24,466 --> 00:40:30,430
Well.

292
00:40:37,896 --> 00:40:41,525
Huh! You'll pay for this.

293
00:40:41,942 --> 00:40:43,402
Ready!

294
00:40:43,402 --> 00:40:45,988
Aim, fire. Aim, fire.

295
00:40:48,949 --> 00:40:50,242
Aim!

00:40:50,284 --> 00:40:51,827
Fire, fire, fire.

00:41:06,758 --> 00:41:10,345
How do you like that?

298
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:16,643
Want some more?
All right, let her go!

299
00:41:19,354 --> 00:41:20,564
It's Bom

300
00:41:20,898 --> 00:41:22,441
Bo!

301
00:41:22,482 --> 00:41:26,528
Force the gates! Man the battlements!
Defend the city!

302
00:41:26,570 --> 00:41:29,948
We're attacked! We're attacked!

303
00:41:41,502 --> 00:41:43,504
Stop! Stop you swine!

304
00:41:43,629 --> 00:41:47,883
Get back to your posts!
Get back there and fight!

305
00:41:48,342 --> 00:41:50,969
We of Blefuscu are not!

306
00:41:53,055 --> 00:41:58,352
... afraid of anything.

307
00:42:04,107 --> 00:42:09,780
Well, where's everyone gone?

308
00:42:09,821 --> 00:42:12,783
This is no way to treat a harmless visitor.

309
00:42:24,378 --> 00:42:31,885
Look Gabby, we've won! Gabby! Gabby?

310
00:42:33,136 --> 00:42:39,351
See Gabby? They've gone.
Yes, sir. Scared stiff.

311
00:42:55,701 --> 00:42:58,662
Hello there.

312
00:43:02,708 --> 00:43:07,504
Come now, don't let my size frighten you.

313
00:43:10,632 --> 00:43:14,636
You, your majesty, surely
you're not afraid of me?

314
00:43:14,678 --> 00:43:16,680
Nuh uh.

315
00:43:16,722 --> 00:43:20,726
Well, good. Then let me present myself.

316
00:43:20,726 --> 00:43:27,065
My name is Gulliver, your majesty.
Lemuel Gulliver, a shipwrecked sailor.

317
00:43:27,107 --> 00:43:29,318
At your service.

318
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:33,989
Well, welcome to Lilliput,
Mr., Mr. Gulliver.

319
00:43:34,031 --> 00:43:37,659
Uh Mr. Gulliver, can you fight?

320
00:43:37,701 --> 00:43:42,164
Well your majesty,
I can lick anybody my size.

321
00:43:42,247 --> 00:43:45,334
Ah, splendid, splendid!

322
00:43:45,375 --> 00:43:49,713
I don't think Bombo will give us any
further trouble while you're around here.

323
00:43:49,755 --> 00:43:51,590
No sir!

324
00:43:51,632 --> 00:43:55,093
He's on our side, Gabby.

325
00:43:55,385 --> 00:43:57,387
He's on our side!

326
00:43:57,429 --> 00:43:58,889
There's nothing to fear!

327
00:43:58,972 --> 00:44:02,351
The man mountain's on our side!

Pull it off! Take it off!

You understand that not until
that giant is removed

373
00:48:21,485 --> 00:48:25,239
can our forces taste the sweet fruits of victory!

374
00:48:25,364 --> 00:48:31,245
Now then, it is up to you to carry
this message to my spies in Lilliput.

I see that you're a sailor boy.

00:56:56,792 --> 00:56:58,544

422
00:57:08,220 --> 00:57:10,305
Lost her though in a glorious gale,

423
00:57:10,347 --> 00:57:12,391
but I came home on
the back of a whale.

424
00:57:12,432 --> 00:57:15,435

you caught the whale.

425
00:57:15,853 --> 00:57:19,439
Simply grabbed a hold of his tail.

00:57:24,403 --> 00:57:26,655
I climbed a mountain peak so high.

429
00:57:26,697 --> 00:57:29,449
I bumped my head against the sky.

430
00:57:30,742 --> 00:57:33,203
And there I was, where was I?

431
00:57:33,245 --> 00:57:35,205

00:57:48,635 --> 00:57:52,222
Now that's the job that I'd enjoy.

438
00:57:52,973 --> 00:57:55,642
I must be going. Ahoy! Ahoy!

439
00:57:57,561 --> 00:58:01,523
My, my, my.

440
00:58:17,789 --> 00:58:21,043
You put that ball in there.

441
00:58:21,084 --> 00:58:24,546
And then it goes down and around.

442
00:58:24,630 --> 00:58:26,006

443
00:58:26,048 --> 00:58:30,802

00:59:29,361 --> 00:59:31,321

01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:05,267
Concealing a spy.

470
01:02:05,309 --> 01:02:09,688
And at a time of war, too.
That makes it worse!

..is a dead duck.

475
01:02:58,737 --> 01:03:02,282
P.S. What do we do with the body?

476
01:03:07,871 --> 01:03:10,582
Two hearts and a wedding
broken by a melody?

477
01:03:10,624 --> 01:03:13,752
Incredible!

478
01:03:18,173 --> 01:03:19,967
Wait a minute.

479
01:03:19,967 --> 01:03:23,554
I have an idea that might turn
this malice to a melody!

480
01:03:23,637 --> 01:03:28,392
Sing Faithful and Forever
together, as one song.

481
01:03:42,739 --> 01:03:45,534
The giant will be a dead duck.

482
01:03:45,576 --> 01:03:49,288

Obliterate! Annihilate!

Hah! Well, where you been you

517
01:06:06,175 --> 01:06:09,428
Now, get down there to that beach

01:07:53,240 --> 01:07:56,410
Gulliver! Gulliver! Wait for me!

532
01:07:58,203 --> 01:08:02,749
Gulliver! Gulliver!

533
01:08:16,555 --> 01:08:19,183
Let me go! Let me go!

534
01:08:29,526 --> 01:08:31,778
Let's go!

535
01:08:56,512 --> 01:09:01,642
Hold on there!
We can settle this peacefully.

536
01:09:02,100 --> 01:09:03,936
Listen!

537
01:09:04,061 --> 01:09:06,104
Hold you fire!

538
01:09:07,022 --> 01:09:09,274
Hear what I have to say.

539
01:09:30,003 --> 01:09:34,758
Bombo, order your men
to lay down their arms.

540
01:09:37,803 --> 01:09:40,347
Must I make you listen?

541
01:10:32,274 --> 01:10:37,112
David, look! Gulliver's thunder machine.

542
01:10:52,920 --> 01:10:55,172
Wait here, Glory.

543
01:10:56,340 --> 01:10:58,509
David!

544
01:11:04,264 --> 01:11:06,058
Fire!

545
01:11:08,477 --> 01:11:10,479
Fire!

546
01:11:29,748 --> 01:11:34,586
Pull! Come on! Pull! Pull!

547
01:12:10,205 --> 01:12:13,000
David!

548
01:12:18,797 --> 01:12:22,176
Poor, poor, foolish little people.

549
01:12:22,259 --> 01:12:24,178
Look what you've done.

550
01:12:24,261 --> 01:12:28,015
Now go ahead! Break your nutshell heads
over your songs!

551
01:12:28,390 --> 01:12:31,727
But did you have to break Glory's heart,
King Little,

552
01:12:31,810 --> 01:12:34,354
because you are thoughtless and selfish?

553
01:12:34,438 --> 01:12:40,819
And you Bombo, o mighty warrior,
what have you won?

554
01:12:42,196 --> 01:12:44,364
You were too stubborn to think,

555
01:12:44,489 --> 01:12:49,411
too busy quarrelling to lend ear to the
harmony that might have been yours.

556
01:12:53,832 --> 01:12:56,710
But now in your sorrow and despair,

557
01:12:56,752 --> 01:13:00,964
perhaps you will listen to your songs
as they might be sung.

558
01:13:10,349 --> 01:13:19,525
# Faithful forever whatever I do #

559
01:13:19,608 --> 01:13:23,946
# Remember I'm true, #

560
01:13:23,946 --> 01:13:28,367
# remember that #

561
01:13:28,659 --> 01:13:38,335
# Faithful forever and thankful for you #

562
01:13:38,418 --> 01:13:42,923
# I'll keep smiling through, #

563
01:13:42,965 --> 01:13:46,844
# remember that #

564
01:13:46,927 --> 01:13:55,435
# We may be apart now and then #

565
01:13:55,519 --> 01:14:00,732
# But I'll hold you in my heart #

566
01:14:00,732 --> 01:14:08,115
# Till you're in my arms again #

567
01:14:08,198 --> 01:14:18,584
# Faithful forever I promise to be #

568
01:14:18,667 --> 01:14:35,225
# So always have faith in me #

569
01:14:39,313 --> 01:14:42,941
In behalf of the peoples of
Blefuscu and Lilliput,

570
01:14:42,983 --> 01:14:51,283
With eternal gratitude and love in our hearts,
we christen thee, Gulliver!

571
01:14:54,703 --> 01:15:00,125
# Come back again, come back #

572
01:15:00,250 --> 01:15:06,507
# Wherever you may be #

573
01:15:06,507 --> 01:15:14,348
# Come back again you sailor man, sailor man #

574
01:15:14,348 --> 01:15:22,898
# Back again from the sea #

575
01:15:34,535 --> 01:15:42,709
# Come back again you sailor man, sailor man #

576
01:15:42,835 --> 01:15:53,637
# Back again from the sea #

577
01:16:08,235 --> 01:16:14,032
-- The End --
