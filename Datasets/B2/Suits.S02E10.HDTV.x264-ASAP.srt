1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:01,387
Mike: Previously on <i>Suits...</i>

2
00:00:01,414 --> 00:00:03,404
You looked me in the eye,
and told me that your hood

3
00:00:03,504 --> 00:00:04,769
was rock solid?

4
00:00:04,771 --> 00:00:06,738
You make it right on your own,
or I will.

5
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:08,807
You want to settle?
Let me save you some time.

6
00:00:08,809 --> 00:00:10,542
We pass. You think I don't know

7
00:00:10,544 --> 00:00:11,810
this was your doing?

8
00:00:11,812 --> 00:00:13,345
Daniel Hardman doesn't work you.
You work him.

9
00:00:13,347 --> 00:00:14,980
What did Hardman
find in those files?

10
00:00:14,982 --> 00:00:16,515
I don't know, and I don't care.

11
00:00:16,517 --> 00:00:19,317
I'm entitled to name one
new senior partner a year.

12
00:00:19,319 --> 00:00:20,752
I'm naming you.

13
00:00:20,754 --> 00:00:21,853
You think he's valuing you.

14
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:23,021
He's buying you.

15
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:24,923
Hardman actually <i>sees</i> me!

16
00:00:24,925 --> 00:00:26,691
You kept me waiting five years.

17
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:28,693
You can wait another 24 hours.

18
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:31,396
It's your grandma.
She passed away.

19
00:00:31,398 --> 00:00:32,564
No.

20
00:00:32,566 --> 00:00:34,766
Either Jessica
will retain her position,

21
00:00:34,768 --> 00:00:38,503
or I will resume control
of Pearson Hardman.

22
00:00:39,666 --> 00:00:41,199
Well...

23
00:00:41,201 --> 00:00:43,968
in a few minutes, we'll know.

24
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:46,398
Last time we spoke,
there was a lot of talk about

25
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:48,007
peeling each other
off the walls.

26
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:48,678
I just want to say...

27
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:51,931
Stop talking.

28
00:00:51,933 --> 00:00:54,867
As you wish.

29
00:01:14,688 --> 00:01:17,623
[Door opens]

30
00:01:17,625 --> 00:01:18,657
[Clears throat]

31
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:19,858
What are you doing here?

32
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:21,393
Rachel, meet the file room.

33
00:01:21,395 --> 00:01:23,495
It's where we store information

34
00:01:23,497 --> 00:01:24,563
on the cases
that we're working on.

35
00:01:24,565 --> 00:01:26,932
No, I-I just mean,

36
00:01:26,934 --> 00:01:29,735
I don't believe that Harvey
would make you come and work

37
00:01:29,737 --> 00:01:33,405
the day after...

38
00:01:33,407 --> 00:01:36,575
You can say it.

39
00:01:36,577 --> 00:01:37,810
[Sighs]

40
00:01:37,812 --> 00:01:39,945
Okay, I'll say it.

41
00:01:39,947 --> 00:01:41,747
The day after
my grandmother died.

42
00:01:41,749 --> 00:01:43,215
And Harvey doesn't know.

43
00:01:43,217 --> 00:01:44,750
What? Why?

44
00:01:44,752 --> 00:01:46,251
'Cause,
there's a vote going on,

45
00:01:46,253 --> 00:01:47,886
and he's got bigger things
on his mind.

46
00:01:47,888 --> 00:01:50,255
- Mike, he'd want to know.
- Oh, really, you know that?

47
00:01:50,257 --> 00:01:52,324
You and... you and Harvey
are best friends now?

48
00:01:52,326 --> 00:01:54,793
Okay, then tell Donna.
Just tell somebody that...

49
00:01:54,795 --> 00:01:56,261
I don't want people to know.

50
00:01:56,263 --> 00:01:58,630
If you tell people,
they will understand,

51
00:01:58,632 --> 00:02:01,100
and then you can go home,
and you can really deal with...

52
00:02:01,102 --> 00:02:04,903
Deal with what, Rachel?

53
00:02:04,905 --> 00:02:06,271
The fact that I missed
my last-ever chance

54
00:02:06,273 --> 00:02:08,273
to see my grandmother
because I was too busy at work?

55
00:02:08,275 --> 00:02:09,742
Oh, come on, that's not fair.

56
00:02:09,744 --> 00:02:11,276
You were an amazing grandson.

57
00:02:11,278 --> 00:02:12,644
You... you were buying
her an apartment...

58
00:02:12,646 --> 00:02:14,480
I bought her an apartment
because I felt guilty

59
00:02:14,482 --> 00:02:16,015
for not having seen her
for two months.

60
00:02:16,017 --> 00:02:17,549
No, you were buying
her an apartment because...

61
00:02:17,551 --> 00:02:19,651
This is not a debate, Rachel.

62
00:02:19,653 --> 00:02:22,254
All right, I came to work
because I want to work.

63
00:02:22,256 --> 00:02:24,456
I'm not telling people because
I don't want to talk about it.

64
00:02:24,458 --> 00:02:26,525
And now I'm gonna go out
and get some fresh air,

65
00:02:26,527 --> 00:02:27,793
and when I get back,

66
00:02:27,795 --> 00:02:31,096
I really hope
you will be done bothering me.

67
00:02:42,108 --> 00:02:43,675
The managing partner...

68
00:02:43,677 --> 00:02:44,810
is Daniel Hardman.

69
00:02:44,812 --> 00:02:47,079
[Murmuring]
Effective immediately.

70
00:02:47,081 --> 00:02:50,983
[Clapping]

71
00:02:50,985 --> 00:02:52,217
I want to thank you for

72
00:02:52,219 --> 00:02:53,452
trusting me with
the future of this firm.

73
00:02:53,454 --> 00:02:55,788
I won't let you down.

74
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:57,956
Let's get back to work.

75
00:02:57,958 --> 00:02:58,957
Harvey...

76
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:01,060
a word.

77
00:03:01,062 --> 00:03:04,063
I know that we have
a rocky history,

78
00:03:04,065 --> 00:03:06,465
but I would be
a fool not to recognize

79
00:03:06,467 --> 00:03:08,467
your value to this firm.
Daniel, you won.

80
00:03:08,469 --> 00:03:10,402
You don't need
to blow smoke up my ass.

81
00:03:10,404 --> 00:03:12,237
I'm not blowing smoke.

82
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:13,839
I told you this
from the day I came back,

83
00:03:13,841 --> 00:03:16,208
that I was us to find
a way to work together.

84
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:18,077
Why say this to me
and not Jessica?

85
00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:19,578
I will.

86
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:21,180
But her name is on the door.

87
00:03:21,182 --> 00:03:22,681
She's not going anywhere.

88
00:03:22,683 --> 00:03:27,586
I want to make sure that you're
not going anywhere either.

89
00:03:27,588 --> 00:03:29,421
It's time to go.

90
00:03:29,423 --> 00:03:31,623
I can name 12 partners
who will follow you anywhere.

91
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:34,093
We can have every associate
in the place.

92
00:03:34,095 --> 00:03:35,527
Harvey...

93
00:03:35,529 --> 00:03:37,229
we're not going anywhere.

94
00:03:37,231 --> 00:03:39,264
We have a non-compete clause.

95
00:03:39,266 --> 00:03:42,701
We quit, we can't practice law
in New York for a year.

96
00:03:42,703 --> 00:03:44,002
Contracts
were made to be broken.

97
00:03:44,004 --> 00:03:46,171
Not when they're written by me.

98
00:03:46,173 --> 00:03:48,440
Well, maybe we should take
a year off.

99
00:03:48,442 --> 00:03:50,109
- How would that go?
- You could teach.

100
00:03:50,111 --> 00:03:52,377
- I could also kill myself.
- You could write a book.

101
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:54,012
- Next.
- What about travel?

102
00:03:54,014 --> 00:03:55,380
You have the means.

103
00:03:55,382 --> 00:03:56,515
See the world.

104
00:03:56,517 --> 00:03:58,317
Teaching, writing, traveling.

105
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,085
You know what
you're talking about?

106
00:04:00,087 --> 00:04:01,120
Running.

107
00:04:01,122 --> 00:04:02,354
I'm not running.

108
00:04:02,356 --> 00:04:05,190
We can't stay here.
Not working for him.

109
00:04:05,192 --> 00:04:06,625
Yes, we can.

110
00:04:06,627 --> 00:04:08,327
We are going
to swallow our pride,

111
00:04:08,329 --> 00:04:09,661
and we're going to wait

112
00:04:09,663 --> 00:04:12,297
until we can make a move
from a position of strength.

113
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:13,732
That's your tactic?

114
00:04:13,734 --> 00:04:15,567
Holding your head down
and waiting?

115
00:04:15,569 --> 00:04:16,935
That's what he did.

116
00:04:16,937 --> 00:04:18,670
It took him five years.
Do you really think it's gonna

117
00:04:18,672 --> 00:04:21,073
take him five years
to screw up again?

118
00:04:21,075 --> 00:04:22,941
I bet it'll be more
like five minutes.

119
00:04:22,943 --> 00:04:25,410
- Jessica...
- That's enough.

120
00:04:25,412 --> 00:04:27,846
This happened today. Today.

121
00:04:27,848 --> 00:04:30,048
We just took the hit.

122
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:31,450
We suffered a loss,

123
00:04:31,452 --> 00:04:33,685
and you don't make
major life decisions

124
00:04:33,687 --> 00:04:36,321
when you're reeling
from a loss.

125
00:04:42,929 --> 00:04:45,831
I wanna buy some weed.

126
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:47,065
[Chuckles]

127
00:04:47,067 --> 00:04:49,535
Sorry, man, you got
it wrong, but, uh,

128
00:04:49,537 --> 00:04:50,569
hey, if you want a paper,
I'll be...

129
00:04:50,571 --> 00:04:52,804
I'm not a cop, okay?

130
00:04:52,806 --> 00:04:54,006
I know for a fact
that you're a dealer.

131
00:04:54,008 --> 00:04:55,307
I've seen you here
every single day.

132
00:04:55,309 --> 00:04:56,875
I know the drill.

133
00:04:56,877 --> 00:04:58,477
A guy comes up,
he hands you a $100 bill,

134
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:00,546
he walks away with a folded
newspaper full of weed.

135
00:05:00,548 --> 00:05:01,847
Well, I have money.

136
00:05:01,849 --> 00:05:03,382
If you don't want it,
I'll be happy to take it

137
00:05:03,384 --> 00:05:05,250
to the coffee cart
down at 50th and Lex

138

is your competition.

What the hell?

152
00:05:56,075 --> 00:05:58,275
These bozos walked in here
right after the vote.

153
00:05:58,277 --> 00:06:00,911
We're moving to the 46th floor.

154
00:06:00,913 --> 00:06:02,713
You and Paul Porter
are switching.

155
00:06:02,715 --> 00:06:05,683
Hardman.

156
00:06:05,685 --> 00:06:07,184
Bowties have no place here!

157
00:06:07,186 --> 00:06:09,320
All that bullshit
about working together?

158
00:06:09,322 --> 00:06:10,387
You forgot to mention

159
00:06:10,389 --> 00:06:12,523
that it was down
on the 46th floor.

160
00:06:12,525 --> 00:06:13,891
It's just four walls, Harvey.

161
00:06:13,893 --> 00:06:15,192
Yeah, so is a prison cell,

162
00:06:15,194 --> 00:06:16,827
which is where you send people
to be punished.

163
00:06:16,829 --> 00:06:19,129
Paul Porter was loyal to me

164
00:06:19,131 --> 00:06:20,998
long before
we were Pearson Hardman.

165
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,733
I reward people
who are loyal to me.

166
00:06:22,735 --> 00:06:24,902
Show me you are
one of those people.

167
00:06:24,904 --> 00:06:27,071
It's one thing
to become king of the hill.

168
00:06:27,073 --> 00:06:28,372
It's another to stay there.

169
00:06:28,374 --> 00:06:30,307
Accept this with grace, Harvey.

170
00:06:30,309 --> 00:06:31,575
You want grace?

171
00:06:31,577 --> 00:06:33,911
I'll give you the courtesy
you never gave me.

172
00:06:33,913 --> 00:06:35,579
I'll say it to your face.

173
00:06:35,581 --> 00:06:38,549
I'm coming for you.

174
00:06:44,556 --> 00:06:47,057
What were you doing in there?
Kissing the ring?

175
00:06:47,059 --> 00:06:49,727
Don't try to weasel your way in
with another managing partner.

176
00:06:49,729 --> 00:06:53,964
That job's already taken.

177
00:06:55,734 --> 00:06:57,668
Daniel. You wanted to see me.

178
00:06:59,404 --> 00:07:01,772

00:14:39,047 --> 00:14:40,813
- Rachel.
- Mike,

356
00:14:40,815 --> 00:14:43,816
Rachel and I
are gonna be right here.

357
00:14:43,818 --> 00:14:45,351
You can do this.

358
00:14:45,353 --> 00:14:48,655
I promise, you're gonna feel
so much better after.

359
00:14:48,657 --> 00:14:51,024
Or you'll feel
a hundred times worse.

360
00:14:51,026 --> 00:14:52,859
[Chuckles]

361
00:14:52,861 --> 00:14:56,095
Either way, you gotta do it.

362
00:15:00,301 --> 00:15:03,002
Okay.

363
00:15:03,004 --> 00:15:07,540
I, uh... remember things.

364
00:15:07,542 --> 00:15:13,546
I remember the night that my
parents were taken away from me.

365
00:15:15,015 --> 00:15:18,384
I remember my grandmother
taking me in.

366
00:15:18,386 --> 00:15:20,186
She came to check on me.

367
00:15:20,188 --> 00:15:22,021
It was, uh...

368
00:15:22,023 --> 00:15:25,291
It was the middle
of the night, and...

369
00:15:25,293 --> 00:15:29,062
I had wet the bed.

370
00:15:29,064 --> 00:15:30,196
And she cleaned the sheets, !

371
00:15:30,198 --> 00:15:32,098
And she... she cleaned me all up,

372
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:36,703
and she put me
in her bed, and, uh...

373
00:15:36,705 --> 00:15:42,709
you know, I... started to cry.

374
00:15:42,711 --> 00:15:48,314
Really hard, and, uh...

375
00:15:48,316 --> 00:15:52,352
and she said,
"It's okay, Michael.

376
00:15:52,354 --> 00:15:55,555
"It's okay.

377
00:15:55,557 --> 00:15:58,758
"I've been crying too.

378
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,793
"But don't you wet this bed,

379
00:16:00,795 --> 00:16:05,098
because I have
to sleep here too."

380
00:16:08,235 --> 00:16:09,736
And, uh...

381
00:16:09,738 --> 00:16:13,740
You know, we laughed,
you know? [Sniffles]

382
00:16:13,742 --> 00:16:18,277
In spite of everything,
we laughed, and...

383
00:16:18,279 --> 00:16:19,445
and we kept laughing.

384
00:16:19,447 --> 00:16:24,684
We kept laughing
until I fell asleep.

385
00:16:24,686 --> 00:16:25,852
When I woke up the next morning,

386
00:16:25,854 --> 00:16:27,620
she wasn't just
my grandmother anymore.

387
00:16:27,622 --> 00:16:32,592
She was...

388
00:16:32,594 --> 00:16:36,596
she was my whole family.

389
00:16:40,634 --> 00:16:46,105
[Sniffles] Well,
I'm not 11 years old anymore.

390
00:16:46,107 --> 00:16:49,776
I'm not gonna wet
the bed tonight.

391
00:16:49,778 --> 00:16:52,712
But I will remember...

392
00:16:52,714 --> 00:16:54,647
that night

393
00:16:54,649 --> 00:16:58,117
and everything
she has ever done for me.

394
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:03,122
For the rest of my life.

395
00:17:10,664 --> 00:17:12,765
- You were great.
- Thank you.

396
00:17:12,767 --> 00:17:14,267
She's right.

397
00:17:14,269 --> 00:17:16,703
I'm Tess, by the way.
Oh, it's good to meet you,

398
00:17:16,705 --> 00:17:18,404
Tess. Good to meet you, Rachel.

399
00:17:18,406 --> 00:17:19,539
Are you two...

400
00:17:19,541 --> 00:17:20,940
- Uh...
- Oh.

401
00:17:20,942 --> 00:17:22,008
[Both laughing]

402
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:23,876
No, no. We work together.

403
00:17:23,878 --> 00:17:25,378
I assume you knew Edith?

404
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:27,046
Grammy was the best part
about being friends

405
00:17:27,048 --> 00:17:28,981
with this guy.
Oh, you called her grammy too?

406
00:17:28,983 --> 00:17:32,018
- Oh, everybody did.
- So you guys must go way back.

407
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:35,521
Short story is, we've known
each other since we were seven.

408
00:17:35,523 --> 00:17:38,024
Long story is,
you dated each other.

409
00:17:38,026 --> 00:17:40,593
Mm, I don't think we need
to get into the long story.

410
00:17:40,595 --> 00:17:41,761
We shared
a few milestones together.

411
00:17:41,763 --> 00:17:42,895
First beer,

412
00:17:42,897 --> 00:17:44,464
prom, sex...

413
00:17:44,466 --> 00:17:46,799
And there's the long story.

414
00:17:46,801 --> 00:17:47,967
Well, I don't
know about you two,

415
00:17:47,969 --> 00:17:49,168
but I think we should get drunk.

416
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:50,937
I wish, but I have
to go pack up her room.

417
00:17:50,939 --> 00:17:53,239
I have to get
back to the office,

418
00:17:53,241 --> 00:17:57,910
and I do not want to see
you there later today, okay?

419
00:17:57,912 --> 00:17:59,212
- Thanks, Rachel.
- Yeah, of course.

420
00:17:59,214 --> 00:18:00,780
Let me know if you need
anything, just call me.

421
00:18:00,782 --> 00:18:01,914
- Mm-hmm.
- Really good to meet you.

422
00:18:01,916 --> 00:18:04,450
You too.

423
00:18:10,491 --> 00:18:13,192
Doth my eyes deceive me?

424
00:18:13,194 --> 00:18:14,494
It appears that you're actually
doing the task

425
00:18:14,496 --> 00:18:15,762
that you've been assigned.

426
00:18:15,764 --> 00:18:16,863
Doth you want to kiss my ass?

427
00:18:16,865 --> 00:18:18,197
I sense frustration.

428
00:18:18,199 --> 00:18:19,565
Case too much?

429
00:18:19,567 --> 00:18:22,101
Can't handle all those numbers?
Louis, just because

430
00:18:22,103 --> 00:18:23,536
financial cases bore me

431
00:18:23,538 --> 00:18:26,839
doesn't mean
I can't do them in my sleep.

432
00:18:26,841 --> 00:18:28,841
Well, did you remember
to do this?

433
00:18:28,843 --> 00:18:30,510
I didn't have to,
because I did that.

434
00:18:30,512 --> 00:18:31,644
Well, that means
that you have to...

435
00:18:31,646 --> 00:18:32,745
Replace the custodian,

436
00:18:32,747 --> 00:18:34,614
have an alternate,
show precedence,

437
00:18:34,616 --> 00:18:36,082
generate cash flow projections,

438
00:18:36,084 --> 00:18:39,285
and have everything audited
by an experienced fiduciary?

439
00:18:39,287 --> 00:18:41,120
Impressive.

440
00:18:41,122 --> 00:18:43,956
Well, I'll review these
for court, 4:00 p.m. today,

441
00:18:43,958 --> 00:18:45,358
where you will be
my second chair.

442
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,893
Did I forget to mention that?

443
00:18:46,895 --> 00:18:48,094
My bad.

444
00:18:48,096 --> 00:18:49,495
Oh, and if you want
to pick up some coffee,

445
00:18:49,497 --> 00:18:50,596
I take mine with cream
and stevia.

446
00:18:50,598 --> 00:18:52,198
[Tch]

447
00:18:55,936 --> 00:19:01,541
Would you like me
to put that in your calendar?

448
00:19:01,543 --> 00:19:02,608
[Crash]

449
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:04,710
I will take that as a "no."

450
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,714
She loved you, you know?

451
00:19:08,716 --> 00:19:12,618
Pretty sure she never
got over our breakup.

452
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:15,988
Well, that's because she knew
you would never do better.

453
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:19,492
[Chuckles]

454
00:19:19,494 --> 00:19:21,627
What's going on?

455
00:19:21,629 --> 00:19:26,199
I cancelled on her
the night before she died.

456
00:19:26,201 --> 00:19:27,767
[Sighs] You must feel awful.

457
00:19:27,769 --> 00:19:29,435
I was working.

458
00:19:29,437 --> 00:19:31,070
I don't even remember what for.

459
00:19:31,072 --> 00:19:34,273
And we're talking about me here.

460
00:19:34,275 --> 00:19:36,776
I just know it seemed
so important at the time,

461
00:19:36,778 --> 00:19:38,411
and now...

462
00:19:38,413 --> 00:19:42,348
I didn't even get
to say good-bye to her.

463
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:45,117
But...

464
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:49,355
never really get to say good-bye
to anyone, do I?

465
00:19:49,357 --> 00:19:51,591
The, uh...

466
00:19:51,593 --> 00:19:54,393
the night before
I went to college,

467
00:19:54,395 --> 00:19:57,496
I was supposed to see you,
and I couldn't.

468
00:19:57,498 --> 00:19:59,599
Yeah. Yeah, you were having
dinner with your family.

469
00:19:59,601 --> 00:20:01,734
Yeah.

470
00:20:01,736 --> 00:20:05,538
"Dinner with my family"
was me sobbing in my bed.

471
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:07,773
[Chuckles]

472
00:20:07,775 --> 00:20:11,444
We had said we'd break up
at the end of the summer, but...

473
00:20:11,446 --> 00:20:13,112
I knew if I showed up,

474
00:20:13,114 --> 00:20:15,147
I never would have been able
to do it.

475
00:20:15,149 --> 00:20:19,986
- [Sighs]
- I'm sorry. I just...

476
00:20:19,988 --> 00:20:23,756
I didn't have the guts
to say good-bye.

477
00:20:23,758 --> 00:20:25,324
It's okay.

478
00:20:50,384 --> 00:20:53,085
Mike...

479
00:20:53,087 --> 00:20:56,689
I'm married.

480
00:20:56,691 --> 00:20:58,324
You

481
00:20:58,326 --> 00:21:00,893
are you kidding me?

482
00:21:00,895 --> 00:21:03,396
Wait...

483
00:21:03,398 --> 00:21:05,131
- Mike...
- Get out.

484
00:21:05,133 --> 00:21:07,800
Right.

485
00:21:07,802 --> 00:21:09,635
- Go.
- All right.

486
00:21:25,423 --> 00:21:28,925
[Knocking at door]

487
00:21:31,896 --> 00:21:33,129
When I sent you home,

488
00:21:33,131 --> 00:21:36,966
I didn't mean for you
to never come back.

489
00:21:36,968 --> 00:21:39,135
My grandmother died.

490
00:21:39,137 --> 00:21:40,937
I know.

491
00:21:40,939 --> 00:21:44,574
Look, you obviously weren't
ready to deal with it,

492
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:47,043
so I respected that
by keeping you busy.

493
00:21:47,045 --> 00:21:50,346
Was I wrong?

494
00:21:50,348 --> 00:21:53,016
No.

495
00:21:53,018 --> 00:21:55,185
- Are you stoned?
- Yep.

496
00:21:55,187 --> 00:21:57,754
And I'm not interested
in a lecture, so...

497
00:21:57,756 --> 00:22:01,424
Good, 'cause I'm not
interested in giving one.

498
00:22:06,263 --> 00:22:09,132
Yeah, help yourself.

499
00:22:09,134 --> 00:22:12,268
Don't mind if I do.

500
00:22:15,606 --> 00:22:18,141
[Inhales]

501
00:22:18,143 --> 00:22:20,477
Is this the coffee cart guy?

502
00:22:20,479 --> 00:22:24,147
[Distant traffic sounds]

503
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:30,920
Look, Donna, for the record,

504
00:22:30,922 --> 00:22:34,657
I am sorry that you got caught
in this crossfire.

505
00:22:34,659 --> 00:22:37,861
And no matter
what happens with...

506
00:22:37,863 --> 00:22:41,698
there will always
be a place here for you.

507
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,333
With you?

508
00:22:43,335 --> 00:22:44,701
Yeah. Yes.

509
00:22:44,703 --> 00:22:46,369
It would be my honor.

510
00:22:46,371 --> 00:22:50,340
You really don't get it,
do you?

511
00:22:50,342 --> 00:22:53,176
Harvey and I are like this.

512
00:22:53,178 --> 00:22:55,011
You think I would leave
him for anybody,

513
00:22:55,013 --> 00:22:57,180
let alone somebody
who did what you did?

514
00:22:57,182 --> 00:22:59,382
You betrayed your team.

515
00:22:59,384 --> 00:23:01,484
Harvey and Jessica
were not my team.

516
00:23:01,486 --> 00:23:02,886
Yes, they were.

517
00:23:02,888 --> 00:23:05,822
And I was.
But no one is anymore.

518
00:23:05,824 --> 00:23:08,258
And I might not like moving,

519
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:10,627
but the one thing
that I love about it

520
00:23:10,629 --> 00:23:16,432
is that it is further away
from your smug face.

521
00:23:16,434 --> 00:23:18,601
[Hiphop music] The whole bag?

522
00:23:18,603 --> 00:23:20,170
How do you even do that, man?

523
00:23:20,172 --> 00:23:23,039
It's like... I've got, like,
crazy cotton mouth right now.

524
00:23:23,041 --> 00:23:25,708
Harvey Specter doesn't
get cotton "mouff."

525
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:27,143
- Cotton "mouff"?
- Mouff.

526
00:23:27,145 --> 00:23:30,013
[Laughs] I guess Harvey
Specter does get cotton "mouff."

527
00:23:30,015 --> 00:23:31,548
I can't help it,
these pretzels...

528
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:34,050
Both: Are making me thirsty!

529
00:23:34,052 --> 00:23:37,587
[Laughter]

530
00:23:37,589 --> 00:23:41,457
- Here, drink this, rookie.
- Oh, my God, I...

531
00:23:41,459 --> 00:23:44,227
[chuckles]

532
00:23:44,229 --> 00:23:48,565
[Sighs]

533
00:23:48,567 --> 00:23:52,702
Did you ever hear of a hanger?
Oh, God, wow!

534
00:23:52,704 --> 00:23:54,404
[Chuckling]

535
00:23:54,406 --> 00:23:56,472
I just got an image
of you as a dad.

536
00:23:56,474 --> 00:23:58,775
[Laughs] With, like, a little
Harvey Specter, you know,

537
00:23:58,777 --> 00:24:00,476
all hair-gelled, and, like,

538
00:24:00,478 --> 00:24:02,812
pinstripe Oshkosh B'gosh.

539
00:24:02,814 --> 00:24:04,948
"Dad, don't play the odds,
play the man.

540
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:06,516
It's... it's a win-win."
You being like,

541
00:24:06,518 --> 00:24:09,385
"go to your goddamn room."
Oh, look at this.

542
00:24:09,387 --> 00:24:11,721
You bought an apartment
in Manhattan.

543
00:24:11,723 --> 00:24:14,224
I got it for her.

544
00:24:16,727 --> 00:24:18,061
Oh.

545
00:24:21,599 --> 00:24:24,867
I always hated
the word "orphan."

546
00:24:24,869 --> 00:24:30,707
I mean, I just...
I never felt like one.

547
00:24:30,709 --> 00:24:33,243
Until now.

548
00:24:38,048 --> 00:24:39,349
I ever tell you about my dad?

549
00:24:39,351 --> 00:24:44,787
I think you know
the answer to that question.

550
00:24:44,789 --> 00:24:46,589
He was a saxophone player.

551
00:24:46,591 --> 00:24:49,525
He sat in with everybody
because everybody loved him.

552
00:24:49,527 --> 00:24:51,628
He believed in love
at first sight,

553
00:24:51,630 --> 00:24:56,032
and unfortunately...

554
00:24:56,034 --> 00:24:59,769
his first sight was a groupie.

555
00:24:59,771 --> 00:25:01,504
Your mother.

556
00:25:01,506 --> 00:25:04,741
I was 16
when I caught her cheating.

557
00:25:04,743 --> 00:25:10,113
I knew if I told my dad he'd...

558
00:25:10,115 --> 00:25:13,049
next two years went by,
I didn't say a thing,

559
00:25:13,051 --> 00:25:16,352
and she went right on just...

560
00:25:16,354 --> 00:25:19,722
making him a fool.

561
00:25:19,724 --> 00:25:21,324
Look, this is all to say that,

562
00:25:21,326 --> 00:25:24,594
I lived in a house
surrounded by family,

563
00:25:24,596 --> 00:25:28,531
but I know what it's like
to be totally alone.

564
00:25:28,533 --> 00:25:32,101
Wow.

565
00:25:32,103 --> 00:25:34,871
Your stoned is depressing.

566
00:25:34,873 --> 00:25:37,674
You should never share
your feelings ever again.

567
00:25:37,676 --> 00:25:39,309
I mean, not with me.

568
00:25:39,311 --> 00:25:41,311
I gotta say, it's been
a tough week for both of us.

569
00:25:41,313 --> 00:25:44,314
- Hardman.
- Oh, what I wouldn't give

570
00:25:44,316 --> 00:25:46,082
to piss in that
bastard's office.

571
00:25:46,084 --> 00:25:47,183
[Snickers]

572
00:25:47,185 --> 00:25:48,851
That was pretty quick
off the tongue.

573
00:25:48,853 --> 00:25:50,920
Well, I've done it before.

574
00:25:50,922 --> 00:25:52,522
To Louis. No way.

575
00:25:52,524 --> 00:25:54,223
- Way.
- [Laughs]

576
00:25:54,225 --> 00:25:57,860
[Both laughing]

577
00:25:57,862 --> 00:26:00,830
Wait a minute.

578
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:02,098
If you've done that before...

579
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:05,068
Why not do it again?

580
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:08,638
[Chuckling] [Ding]

581
00:26:15,145 --> 00:26:16,212
Okay. Let's go.

582
00:26:16,214 --> 00:26:17,380
No, no, no, no, no. [Claps]

583
00:26:17,382 --> 00:26:18,448
It's not right.

584
00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:19,515
It's not right?

585
00:26:19,517 --> 00:26:20,750
I drank three Gatorades
on the way here.

586
00:26:20,752 --> 00:26:22,051
I'm gonna pee orange.
It's right.

587
00:26:22,053 --> 00:26:23,252
[Ding]

588
00:26:23,254 --> 00:26:24,854
No.

589
00:26:24,856 --> 00:26:26,356
If we're gonna do something,

590
00:26:26,358 --> 00:26:28,057
it needs to be original.
[Whispers] Orange.

591
00:26:28,059 --> 00:26:30,793
No

592
00:26:30,795 --> 00:26:32,228
you know what?

593
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:35,298
I know what we're gonna do.

594
00:26:38,502 --> 00:26:42,138
I'm gonna get the can opener.

595
00:26:44,808 --> 00:26:46,442
Are you serious right now?
You're not messing with me?

596
00:26:46,444 --> 00:26:47,577
You're finally gonna tell me

597
00:26:47,579 --> 00:26:48,745
what you do with
that can opener?

598
00:26:48,747 --> 00:26:50,346
- Do I look serious?
- You look stoned.

599
00:26:50,348 --> 00:26:53,883
I am, but I never joke
about the can opener.

600
00:26:53,885 --> 00:26:55,551
Come on. Mmm.

601
00:26:55,553 --> 00:26:57,420
Let's go, let's go.

602
00:26:57,422 --> 00:26:59,288
- All right, go.
- All right...

603
00:26:59,290 --> 00:27:01,257
What we do is...

604
00:27:12,336 --> 00:27:14,404
Okay, if you were
a narcissist with great hair,

605
00:27:14,406 --> 00:27:15,571
what would your password be?

606
00:27:15,573 --> 00:27:21,077
Pssh, Harvey.

607
00:27:21,079 --> 00:27:23,880
Specter. [Types]

608
00:27:23,882 --> 00:27:25,081
No, that's just way too easy.

609
00:27:25,083 --> 00:27:27,717
One of his favorite
basketball players.

610
00:27:27,719 --> 00:27:33,055
Shaquille O'Bryant?

611
00:27:33,057 --> 00:27:34,857
[Ding]

612
00:27:37,961 --> 00:27:40,062
I still don't understand
the thumbtack thing.

613
00:27:40,064 --> 00:27:44,300
- Surprising, isn't it?
- Yeah.

614
00:27:44,302 --> 00:27:46,002
Hey, say what you will
about this floor,

615
00:27:46,004 --> 00:27:48,271
I'm pretty sure the cubicles
are bigger.

616
00:27:51,542 --> 00:27:52,975
[Clears throat]

617
00:27:54,978 --> 00:27:57,246
Hey, what's going on?
How you guys doing?

618
00:27:57,248 --> 00:27:59,382
I was just, uh, helping
box a little bit,

619
00:27:59,384 --> 00:28:01,451
'cause, uh, Donna was feeling
a little blue about moving.

620
00:28:01,453 --> 00:28:03,486
What the hell are you doing?

621
00:28:03,488 --> 00:28:05,488
Harvey. Harvey!

622
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:07,790
You looking for another way
to make my life miserable?

623
00:28:07,792 --> 00:28:08,925
Harvey! Harvey, no!

624
00:28:08,927 --> 00:28:11,794
Come on. You hit him, they win.

625
00:28:20,170 --> 00:28:21,170
[Sighs]

626
00:28:24,068 --> 00:28:25,309
You should of let me hit him.

627
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:26,743
Oh, I don't know about that,

628
00:28:26,745 --> 00:28:29,178
but maybe we shouldn't have
let him leave.

629
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:30,246
Why?

630
00:28:30,248 --> 00:28:31,681
Eh, uh, maybe
he wasn't snooping.

631
00:28:31,683 --> 00:28:33,516
Maybe he was, I don't know,
trying to plant something,

632
00:28:33,518 --> 00:28:35,585
like... like drugs.
In my record collection?

633
00:28:35,587 --> 00:28:36,786
[Jamaican accent]
What better place to stash

634
00:28:36,788 --> 00:28:39,455
the weed than with
the Bob Marley, man?

635
00:28:39,457 --> 00:28:41,457
Louis doesn't even know where
to buy drugs,

636
00:28:41,459 --> 00:28:43,459
let alone plant them.

637
00:28:43,461 --> 00:28:45,628
- I know where to buy drugs.
- Congratulations.

638
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:47,764
No, I'm serious.
What if instead of peeing,

639
00:28:47,766 --> 00:28:49,098
we planted something
in Hardman's office.

640
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:50,566
Unh, genius!

641
00:28:50,568 --> 00:28:52,001
- It's a crime.
- Mm, maybe.

642
00:28:52,003 --> 00:28:53,469
But he wouldn't hesitate
for one second

643
00:28:53,471 --> 00:28:57,006
to do the same thing
to get rid of you.

644
00:28:57,008 --> 00:28:58,474
What?

645
00:28:58,476 --> 00:29:00,376
He wouldn't hesitate to plant
something to get rid of me.

646
00:29:00,378 --> 00:29:02,712
- What, Louis?
- No, Hardman.

647
00:29:02,714 --> 00:29:04,147
- [Sighs] I just said that.
- No.

648
00:29:04,149 --> 00:29:07,283
What if Hardman planted
the CM memo in the first place?

649
00:29:07,285 --> 00:29:08,684
Well.

650
00:29:08,686 --> 00:29:10,086
Donna never saw the memo.

651
00:29:10,088 --> 00:29:13,222
Donna never makes mistakes.

652
00:29:13,224 --> 00:29:14,924
What if she never saw
it four years ago

653
00:29:14,926 --> 00:29:19,195
because it wasn't there?

654
00:29:19,197 --> 00:29:22,165
And then it was.

655
00:29:22,167 --> 00:29:24,200
You really think
he had the balls

656
00:29:24,202 --> 00:29:25,535
to walk into that file room,

657
00:29:25,537 --> 00:29:27,470
open a box,
and plant a document?

658
00:29:27,472 --> 00:29:30,306
There's no security cameras
and no locks on the doors.

659
00:29:30,308 --> 00:29:32,275
Fine, but how did he get
the document in the first place?

660
00:29:32,277 --> 00:29:34,043
Hardman brought Coastal Motors
into the firm.

661
00:29:34,045 --> 00:29:35,845
Yeah, but he wasn't here
when the case went to trial.

662
00:29:35,847 --> 00:29:37,680
No, not the trial, the defect.

663
00:29:37,682 --> 00:29:39,849
What's the date
Sarah Layton left CM?

664
00:29:39,851 --> 00:29:42,618
There.

665
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:44,253
- Hardman was still here.
- Makes sense.

666
00:29:44,255 --> 00:29:46,489
Sarah Layton confronts Kemp.

667
00:29:46,491 --> 00:29:48,691
He panics.
Who's the first person he calls?

668
00:29:48,693 --> 00:29:50,560
- His lawyer.
- Hardman tells him to bury it.

669
00:29:50,562 --> 00:29:52,028
That's a crime.

670
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:54,063
You said yourself he wouldn't
hesitate to commit a crime.

671
00:29:54,065 --> 00:29:57,433
He knew the cars were bad
from the beginning.

672
00:29:57,435 --> 00:29:59,068
[Laughs] What?

673
00:29:59,070 --> 00:30:00,636
When Hardman came back,

674
00:30:00,638 --> 00:30:02,305
the first thing he did
was ask Louis for a report

675
00:30:02,307 --> 00:30:04,106
on every case at the firm.

676
00:30:04,108 --> 00:30:06,108
Yeah, he was looking
for weaknesses.

677
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:07,743
He knew the CM win
was based on a lie,

678
00:30:07,745 --> 00:30:10,580
made it look like it was my lie.
Which brings us to?

679
00:30:10,582 --> 00:30:11,848
Tanner.

680
00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:13,416
Hardman couldn't bring
the suit himself.

681
00:30:13,418 --> 00:30:14,650
He needed an executioner.

682
00:30:14,652 --> 00:30:16,352
And he picked Tanner.

683
00:30:16,354 --> 00:30:18,087
So when I suspected
something was fishy,

684
00:30:18,089 --> 00:30:21,324
I'd focus on Tanner, not him.

685
00:30:21,326 --> 00:30:22,859
They were in on it together.

686
00:30:22,861 --> 00:30:24,727
I went through every box
that Hardman looked at,

687
00:30:24,729 --> 00:30:26,095
to find dirt on Tanner.

688
00:30:26,097 --> 00:30:27,230
There was no dirt.

689
00:30:27,232 --> 00:30:28,598
You need to call
a partner meeting.

690
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,766
I'll call for it...

691
00:30:30,768 --> 00:30:33,002
five minutes after
you get me some proof.

692
00:30:33,004 --> 00:30:36,706
[Grunting]

693
00:30:36,708 --> 00:30:38,808
[Door slams closed] [Grunts]

694
00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:42,044
Sorry, Harvey.
Pilates is on Wednesdays.

695
00:30:42,046 --> 00:30:43,613
You and I are gonna go.

696
00:30:43,615 --> 00:30:45,515
And when we're done,

697
00:30:45,517 --> 00:30:48,017
you're gonna admit
to me what you did.

698
00:30:48,019 --> 00:30:49,986
Oh, I've done
a lot of things, Harvey.

699
00:30:49,988 --> 00:30:51,487
Well, I want to know
why you settled.

700
00:30:51,489 --> 00:30:52,889
You know damn well
why I settled.

701
00:30:52,891 --> 00:30:53,956
No, I don't.

702
00:30:53,958 --> 00:30:55,491
I want to know about
you and Hardman,

703
00:30:55,493 --> 00:30:57,627
and you're gonna answer
my questions,

704
00:30:57,629 --> 00:30:59,262
or I'm gonna kick your ass.

705
00:30:59,264 --> 00:31:02,298
I'm not doing the one,
and you can't do the other.

706
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:04,033
I can, and you will.

707
00:31:04,035 --> 00:31:05,067
All right, let's go.

708
00:31:05,069 --> 00:31:06,135
As long as it takes.

709
00:31:06,137 --> 00:31:08,971
I win, you talk?

710
00:31:08,973 --> 00:31:11,574
You lose, I don't.

711
00:31:22,519 --> 00:31:23,519
[Smack] [Grunts] Unh.

712
00:31:23,521 --> 00:31:24,520
Uh!

713
00:31:31,428 --> 00:31:33,429
[Grunts, smack] Oh!

714
00:31:33,431 --> 00:31:36,265
Why'd you settle?

715
00:31:36,267 --> 00:31:38,034
Unh! I decline to answer.

716
00:31:39,202 --> 00:31:40,903
Ohh! Why'd you settle?

717
00:31:43,373 --> 00:31:45,508
I decline to answer.

718
00:31:50,614 --> 00:31:52,148
Unh!

719
00:31:59,222 --> 00:32:01,157
[Smack] Unh!

720
00:32:10,601 --> 00:32:11,601
Yah!

721
00:32:16,573 --> 00:32:20,843
[Both panting]

722
00:32:23,847 --> 00:32:25,247
You get one question.

723
00:32:25,249 --> 00:32:26,716
Well, let's see.

724
00:32:26,718 --> 00:32:30,119
How about, why'd you settle?

725
00:32:30,121 --> 00:32:31,721
Because that memo was a fraud.

726
00:32:31,723 --> 00:32:34,290
What? You need
to come forward...

727
00:32:34,292 --> 00:32:36,592
No, no, no, no, no.
I said one question, Harvey.

728
00:32:36,594 --> 00:32:40,129
One question.

729
00:32:50,374 --> 00:32:52,508
Oh, my God.

730
00:32:52,510 --> 00:32:53,976
We were right.

731
00:32:53,978 --> 00:32:56,579
- Right about what?
- [Sighs] I found it. [Laughs]

732
00:32:56,581 --> 00:32:59,615
- You found what?
- I found it!

733
00:33:02,586 --> 00:33:04,120
Mm.

734
00:33:04,122 --> 00:33:05,321
Mm.

735
00:33:05,323 --> 00:33:06,856
Mm.

736
00:33:06,858 --> 00:33:08,090
No, no.

737
00:33:08,092 --> 00:33:09,925
It can't be...
it can't be like this.

738
00:33:09,927 --> 00:33:11,027
Why?

739
00:33:11,029 --> 00:33:12,428
Because your grandmother
just died.

740
00:33:12,430 --> 00:33:14,664
You think not kissing is going
to make that any better?

741
00:33:14,666 --> 00:33:16,365
No, no, I think that's exactly
what it's gonna do,

742
00:33:16,367 --> 00:33:17,800
and that's why it's a problem.

743
00:33:17,802 --> 00:33:20,036
Rachel, in the middle
of the worst week ever,

744
00:33:20,038 --> 00:33:21,971
I have found a moment
of something good.

745
00:33:21,973 --> 00:33:25,508
Now, ple... I know.

746
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:26,776
But when something
like that happens,

747
00:33:26,778 --> 00:33:32,715
people don't make smart choices.

748
00:33:32,717 --> 00:33:34,417
Yeah.

749
00:33:34,419 --> 00:33:37,520
No, you're right.

750
00:33:37,522 --> 00:33:39,722
But being smart...

751
00:33:39,724 --> 00:33:43,359
hasn't made either
one of us very happy.

752
00:33:47,564 --> 00:33:48,564
[Sighs]

753
00:33:56,297 --> 00:33:57,463
- Daniel.
- Louis.

754
00:33:57,465 --> 00:33:59,599
I have something
that may be of interest.

755
00:33:59,601 --> 00:34:00,767
Already?

756
00:34:00,769 --> 00:34:03,303
I'm notoriously fast.

757
00:34:03,305 --> 00:34:04,837
I have certain suspicions.

758
00:34:04,839 --> 00:34:08,174
All I need you to do
is authorize action.

759
00:34:08,176 --> 00:34:09,976
You really think he does?

760
00:34:09,978 --> 00:34:13,646
I really think he did.

761
00:34:13,648 --> 00:34:14,948
I am impressed.

762
00:34:14,950 --> 00:34:16,382
You'd be surprised
what can do now

763
00:34:16,384 --> 00:34:19,686
that I have
the proper motivation.

764
00:34:19,688 --> 00:34:22,322
[Ding]

765
00:34:24,758 --> 00:34:26,025
You're banned on this floor.

766
00:34:26,027 --> 00:34:27,427
That's funny.

767
00:34:27,429 --> 00:34:30,263
It's pee in a cup time.

768
00:34:30,265 --> 00:34:32,298
Drug tests are for associates,
not the partners.

769
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:34,600
Yeah, well Hardman believes
in running a real clean ship.

770
00:34:34,602 --> 00:34:37,103
You know, like "just say no.
Crack is whack."

771
00:34:37,105 --> 00:34:39,906
Which is why a new policy went
into effect as of this morning.

772
00:34:39,908 --> 00:34:41,074
You know, I don't smell
it on you now,

773
00:34:41,076 --> 00:34:42,241
but I sure as hell
did last night

774
00:34:42,243 --> 00:34:43,843
when you manhandled me
in your office.

775
00:34:43,845 --> 00:34:45,378
I'm sure you had a lot
of fun laughing at that one.

776
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:48,181
You want to take it, you're
gonna have to take it forcibly.

777
00:34:48,183 --> 00:34:49,349
Refusal to take this test

778
00:34:49,351 --> 00:34:50,950
gives me grounds
to fire you for cause.

779
00:34:50,952 --> 00:34:52,352
- I refuse.
- You're fired.

780
00:34:52,354 --> 00:34:54,754
Per our bylaws, I'm entitled
to a hearing in front of

781
00:34:54,756 --> 00:34:58,024
a quorum of our senior partners,
and I'm on record.

782
00:34:58,026 --> 00:34:59,359
What the hell
is wrong with you?

783
00:34:59,361 --> 00:35:01,361
Just take the test.

784
00:35:01,363 --> 00:35:02,695
- I can't.
- Why not?

785
00:35:02,697 --> 00:35:06,332
It's just a drug...

786
00:35:06,334 --> 00:35:08,267
you've got to be kidding me.
You were the one who told me

787
00:35:08,269 --> 00:35:09,602
to take it easy.

788
00:35:09,604 --> 00:35:11,371
And you and I both know
what we did that night

789
00:35:11,373 --> 00:35:12,705
in this very office.

790
00:35:12,707 --> 00:35:16,209
That was a celebration.
This is different, th...

791
00:35:16,211 --> 00:35:18,678
when did this happen?

792
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:20,546
Does it matter when?

793
00:35:20,548 --> 00:35:21,981
I don't believe it.

794
00:35:21,983 --> 00:35:23,116
You were high

795
00:35:23,118 --> 00:35:24,817
when you came up
with that theory.

796
00:35:24,819 --> 00:35:26,452
Doesn't matter how
we got there, we got there.

797
00:35:26,454 --> 00:35:28,554
I bought us some time.

798
00:35:28,556 --> 00:35:30,223
We can use the review
to present our case.

799
00:35:30,225 --> 00:35:31,457
Do you have any evidence?

800
00:35:31,459 --> 00:35:33,192
Not only did
he plant the document,

801
00:35:33,194 --> 00:35:34,327
he wrote the damn thing.

802
00:35:34,329 --> 00:35:35,461
How do you know that?

803
00:35:35,463 --> 00:35:37,997
Tanner... indicated that to me.

804
00:35:37,999 --> 00:35:40,400
Turns out, they weren't
in on it together.

805
00:35:40,402 --> 00:35:42,468
Huh. And he's willing
to testify to that.

806
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:45,838
Oh, let me guess. No, he won't.

807
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,440
I've got Mike chasing
down another avenue.

808
00:35:47,442 --> 00:35:51,544
Jessica, I don't do this now,
I'm gone anyway.

809
00:35:53,881 --> 00:35:55,014
What is it?

810
00:35:55,016 --> 00:35:56,983
Daniel and Louis
got their quorum.

811
00:35:56,985 --> 00:35:59,419
Your review convenes in an hour.

812
00:36:07,528 --> 00:36:08,928
Pursuant to New York
civil code,

813
00:36:08,930 --> 00:36:11,030
a settlement based
on fraudulent representation

814
00:36:11,032 --> 00:36:13,966
can be voided by the court.
Who are you?

815
00:36:13,968 --> 00:36:16,135
My name's Mike Ross.
I work for Harvey Specter.

816
00:36:16,137 --> 00:36:17,870
[Alarm beeps]

817
00:36:17,872 --> 00:36:19,972
Get off my car.

818
00:36:19,974 --> 00:36:22,308
As far as we can tell,
there were only two people

819
00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:23,976
who knew about the problems
with the CM hood.

820
00:36:23,978 --> 00:36:27,547
Sarah Layton, and you.

821
00:36:27,549 --> 00:36:28,881
But I think there was a third.

822
00:36:28,883 --> 00:36:30,183
[Chuckles]

823
00:36:30,185 --> 00:36:32,018
You know, last time I was
ambushed in this garage,

824
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:33,719
I gave in. Not this time.

825
00:36:33,721 --> 00:36:35,188
You met with Daniel Hardman

826
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:38,157
the night before
Sarah Layton's last day.

827
00:36:38,159 --> 00:36:39,492
We have his calendar.

828
00:36:39,494 --> 00:36:40,793
What do you want?

829
00:36:40,795 --> 00:36:43,296
I want you to sign
this affidavit stating

830
00:36:43,298 --> 00:36:45,865
you told Daniel Hardman about
the problems with the hood,

831
00:36:45,867 --> 00:36:47,767
and that he advised you
to bury those problems

832
00:36:47,769 --> 00:36:49,268
and cut a deal
with Sarah Layton.

833
00:36:49,270 --> 00:36:52,138
[Chuckles]

834
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:53,473
Harvey came to me,

835
00:36:53,475 --> 00:36:55,341
told me to settle,
and then we'd be done.

836
00:36:55,343 --> 00:36:56,843
Now you're threatening me,

837
00:36:56,845 --> 00:36:59,579
telling me to put it in writing,
and then we'll be done.

838
00:36:59,581 --> 00:37:02,248
Sorry, junior.

839
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:07,320
We <i>are</i> done.

840
00:37:07,322 --> 00:37:08,554
[Car door closes]

841
00:37:08,556 --> 00:37:09,589
[Car starts]

842
00:37:12,726 --> 00:37:14,160
That kid better get here fast.

843
00:37:14,162 --> 00:37:15,495
He'll come through.

844
00:37:15,497 --> 00:37:17,163
Harvey Specter has refused
to take a mandatory

845
00:37:17,165 --> 00:37:21,134
drug test, leaving me no choice
but to terminate his employment.

846
00:37:21,136 --> 00:37:22,668
As is his right,

847
00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:25,204
he has requested a hearing
to dispute this.

848
00:37:25,206 --> 00:37:26,439
Thank you, Daniel,

849
00:37:26,441 --> 00:37:28,207
but I'm not here
to dispute anything.

850
00:37:28,209 --> 00:37:29,775
After all, I was high.

851
00:37:29,777 --> 00:37:33,980
I was high because I was being
forced to work for you.

852
00:37:33,982 --> 00:37:37,750
A man who, it turns out,
knew CM was negligent

853
00:37:37,752 --> 00:37:39,552
before I ever even
took the case.

854
00:37:39,554 --> 00:37:41,554
- Uh, this is not the time...
- Shut up, Louis.

855
00:37:41,556 --> 00:37:42,688
Don't do this.

856
00:37:42,690 --> 00:37:47,026
If you go, I go.

857
00:37:47,028 --> 00:37:48,961
Do you deny knowing
about the defects?

858
00:37:48,963 --> 00:37:50,730
Unequivocally.

859
00:37:50,732 --> 00:37:52,365
And you deny writing this memo?

860
00:37:52,367 --> 00:37:53,666
Sending it to Tanner,

861
00:37:53,668 --> 00:37:56,869
knowing that he would come
after this entire firm?

862
00:37:56,871 --> 00:37:58,437
That's why he settled.

863
00:37:58,439 --> 00:38:00,573
Because you told him
it wouldn't hold up.

864
00:38:00,575 --> 00:38:02,575
That's wild conjecture,

865
00:38:02,577 --> 00:38:03,809
and it's bullshit.

866
00:38:03,811 --> 00:38:04,944
Why'd he settle?

867
00:38:04,946 --> 00:38:07,079
He settled
because I did what I do.

868
00:38:07,081 --> 00:38:08,214
That is not an answer.

869
00:38:08,216 --> 00:38:10,550
Yes. It is.

870
00:38:10,552 --> 00:38:11,951
This ends here.

871
00:38:11,953 --> 00:38:13,719
The two of you
have now slandered me,

872
00:38:13,721 --> 00:38:15,788
which violates
the morality clause

873
00:38:15,790 --> 00:38:17,023
of the partners' agreement.

874
00:38:17,025 --> 00:38:18,558
It's not slander
if it's the truth.

875
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:23,196
Unfortunately, you don't have
a shred of evidence,

876
00:38:23,198 --> 00:38:25,665
because the evidence
doesn't exist.

877
00:38:25,667 --> 00:38:26,999
Well, actually, it does.

878
00:38:27,001 --> 00:38:29,035
This is a partners-only
meeting.

879
00:38:29,037 --> 00:38:30,169
So have Tanner sue me.

880
00:38:30,171 --> 00:38:31,637
But in the meantime,

881
00:38:31,639 --> 00:38:33,105
I think the rest of the partners
are gonna want to see this.

882
00:38:33,107 --> 00:38:35,908
It's a signed affidavit
from Lawrence Kemp,

883
00:38:35,910 --> 00:38:39,078
stating that he told
Daniel Hardman about the defects

884
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:40,913
in the CM hood six years ago.

885
00:38:40,915 --> 00:38:42,949
May 7th was the date
of that meeting,

886
00:38:42,951 --> 00:38:47,954
per your calendar, to be exact.

887
00:38:47,956 --> 00:38:50,389
You just denied knowing
anything about that,

888
00:38:50,391 --> 00:38:52,158
unequivocally.

889
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,026
I guess you were just lying
to cover up the fact

890
00:38:54,028 --> 00:38:58,731
that you were behind this entire
suit in the first place.

891
00:38:58,733 --> 00:39:01,367
Is that the basis of this?

892
00:39:01,369 --> 00:39:04,804
A coerced lie
from a man trying to say,

893
00:39:04,806 --> 00:39:08,140
"my lawyer made me do it."

894
00:39:08,142 --> 00:39:10,743
No way that holds up in court.
It doesn't have to.

895
00:39:10,745 --> 00:39:12,211
It just has to make these

896
00:39:12,213 --> 00:39:14,680
Harvard-educated
lawyers understand

897
00:39:14,682 --> 00:39:18,918
that you made each and every one
of them spend $100,000

898
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:20,286
of their own money

899
00:39:20,288 --> 00:39:22,755
to buy you control of my firm.

900
00:39:22,757 --> 00:39:25,191
I think we've heard
all we needed to hear.

901
00:39:25,193 --> 00:39:28,261
Harvey has admitted
to violating the drug policy.

902
00:39:28,263 --> 00:39:32,098
All those in favor
of his dismissal?

903
00:39:38,405 --> 00:39:40,206
Looks like you lost.

904
00:39:40,208 --> 00:39:41,874
I'm glad you brought
up the bylaws.

905
00:39:41,876 --> 00:39:46,145
Fraudulently suing your own firm
is grounds for firing.

906
00:39:46,147 --> 00:39:48,080
You have no proof of that.

907
00:39:48,082 --> 00:39:54,086
All those in favor
of Daniel Hardman's dismissal?

908
00:39:56,123 --> 00:39:58,658
Hey, Harvey, I know I'm not
a partner, but do you mind?

909
00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:00,926
- Go ahead.
- Nice.

910
00:40:00,928 --> 00:40:03,963
Daniel, that $3 million
of our money

911
00:40:03,965 --> 00:40:07,133
you spent on yourself.

912
00:40:07,135 --> 00:40:11,570
Consider your partnership
bought out.

913
00:40:11,572 --> 00:40:14,774
What was really
on that affidavit, anyway?

914
00:40:14,776 --> 00:40:16,509
What I said was on it.

915
00:40:16,511 --> 00:40:18,778
You realize it's a felony
to sign someone else's name

916
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:20,046
to a sworn document.

917
00:40:20,048 --> 00:40:23,316
I didn't sign someone
else's name.

918
00:40:23,318 --> 00:40:25,851
I signed my own name. [Exhales]

919
00:40:25,853 --> 00:40:27,153
I mean, seriously,

920
00:40:27,155 --> 00:40:31,090
how often do you really look
at a man's shoes?

921
00:40:34,494 --> 00:40:37,663
To the firm of Pearson
and kiss my ass.

922
00:40:37,665 --> 00:40:40,266
[Laughing] I told you we'd
be peeling him off the wall.

923
00:40:40,268 --> 00:40:43,002
You go, I go.

924
00:40:43,004 --> 00:40:45,905
He goes.

925
00:40:45,907 --> 00:40:48,007
- I already went and came back.
- [Laughs]

926
00:40:56,983 --> 00:41:00,252
[Knocking at door]

927
00:41:05,492 --> 00:41:07,326
You're married.

928
00:41:07,328 --> 00:41:09,595
I am.

929
00:41:09,597 --> 00:41:11,697
You called me anyway.

930
00:41:11,699 --> 00:41:13,299
I did.

931
00:41:24,745 --> 00:41:27,179
So we're clear...

932
00:41:27,181 --> 00:41:30,216
I don't consider anything
bought out.

933
00:41:30,218 --> 00:41:31,650
Too bad.

934
00:41:31,652 --> 00:41:33,519
'Cause the only way
you're getting another penny

935
00:41:33,521 --> 00:41:35,354
is through litigation.

936
00:41:35,356 --> 00:41:38,090
We may not have proof now,
but we will.

937
00:41:38,092 --> 00:41:41,961
If this comes out at trial,
you'll never practice again.

938
00:41:41,963 --> 00:41:44,330
Sign this confidentiality
agreement.

939
00:41:44,332 --> 00:41:46,365
I'll waive my claim.

940
00:41:46,367 --> 00:41:51,337
One time offer.
Take it or leave it.

941
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:56,108
For the record, I wasn't
the one who made the first move.

942
00:41:56,110 --> 00:41:57,443
Harvey was.

943
00:41:57,445 --> 00:42:01,747
Yeah, you made your first
move five years ago.

944
00:42:01,749 --> 00:42:05,384
Maybe. But someday...

945
00:42:05,386 --> 00:42:07,520
He'll make the first move
on you.

946
00:42:07,522 --> 00:42:10,756
Goodbye, Daniel.

947
00:42:12,092 --> 00:42:14,927
Are you gonna throw something
at me?

948
00:42:14,929 --> 00:42:18,330
I'll go.

949
00:42:18,332 --> 00:42:24,336
But don't kid yourself that this
is the last page of the story.

950
00:42:27,874 --> 00:42:30,576
- Give me your toes.
- [Giggles] No.

951
00:42:30,578 --> 00:42:33,379
[Both laughing]

952
00:42:33,381 --> 00:42:35,448
Oh, just like riding a bike.

953
00:42:35,450 --> 00:42:36,916
Oh, okay.

954
00:42:36,918 --> 00:42:39,251
I should be more upset that you
just compared me to a bike,

955
00:42:39,253 --> 00:42:41,520
but I love bikes. [Giggles]

956
00:42:41,522 --> 00:42:44,657
[Knocking at door] Mmm, mwah.

957
00:42:44,659 --> 00:42:47,026
- Pizza.
- Okay.

958
00:42:47,028 --> 00:42:48,227
Unh. Oh!

959
00:42:48,229 --> 00:42:50,996
Pepperoni. [Laughter]

960
00:42:50,998 --> 00:42:53,032
[Sighs] Is this a bad time
to tell you that I'm a vegan?

961
00:42:53,034 --> 00:42:55,067
Um, no.

962
00:42:55,069 --> 00:42:56,202
More pizza for me.

963
00:42:56,204 --> 00:42:59,071
- [Chuckles]
- Mwah.

964
00:42:59,073 --> 00:43:01,106
[Sighs]

965
00:43:03,376 --> 00:43:05,110
You were right.

966
00:43:05,112 --> 00:43:08,647
I don't care about being smart.

967
00:43:18,158 --> 00:43:20,292
Rachel...
