1
00:00:07,382 --> 00:00:10,012
Two IVs in place in antecubital fossae.

2
00:00:10,093 --> 00:00:11,643
- Any known allergies?
- Um...

3
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,050
When was the last time he ate?

4
00:00:13,138 --> 00:00:14,458
- I... I don't know.
- Blood type?

5
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:17,095
- Um... It was...
- Height? Weight?

6
00:00:17,183 --> 00:00:18,603
Uh, he's, uh...

7
00:00:18,893 --> 00:00:20,853
- Relation?
- He's my husband!

8
00:00:20,937 --> 00:00:22,937
He's my husband! Mark!

9
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:27,565
No! No!

10
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:04,562
- Hi.
- I thought I heard something.

11
00:01:04,647 --> 00:01:06,937
- Is everything all right?
- Yeah. I just, um...

12
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:08,025
I stubbed my toe.

13
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:10,279
Um, the... the light's not working.

14
00:01:10,862 --> 00:01:12,452
There's a power outage across town.

15
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:15,240
It happens every time
we get a big storm rolling through.

16
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:17,825
Great. Um, do you know
when it's gonna come back on?

17
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:18,911
It's impossible to say.

18
00:01:18,995 --> 00:01:21,365
It depends on how damaged
the power lines are.

19
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:24,625
You okay?

20
00:01:24,667 --> 00:01:27,547
I'm just not... I'm not a fan of storms.

21
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:32,799
Oh. Well, I am sorry to say
we get them quite often this time of year.

22
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:40,062
Whenever there's a power outage,
the whole town congregates at Jack's Bar.

23
00:01:40,141 --> 00:01:43,311
We'll be heading over in a little while.
Do you wanna walk with us?

24
00:01:43,394 --> 00:01:45,314
Oh. No, no, I'll just stay here.

25
00:01:45,396 --> 00:01:46,396
Honey, you'll freeze.

26
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:49,071
It's fine. I'll just...
I'll... I'll put some layers on.

27
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:52,490
I love this house,
but without heat, it gets cold. Fast.

28
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:53,950
It's... it's okay. I'll be fine.

29
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:55,781
Really.

30
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:57,491
Okay.

31
00:01:58,243 --> 00:02:01,253
But if you change your mind,
you know where to find us.

32
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:02,329
Thank you.

33
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:58,550
Okay.

34
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:04,683
Hey, Doc.

35
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:05,636
Hey, Jack.

36
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:06,727
Good to have you back.

37
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:07,769
Yeah.

38
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:09,564
So, the steelheads bitin'?

39
00:03:09,647 --> 00:03:12,567
Oh, I practically had to kick 'em
out of the boat.

40
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:13,740
How many'd you bring back?

41
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:16,992
Well, I reeled in quite a few beauties,
but you know me,

42
00:03:17,071 --> 00:03:18,361
I'm a catch and release man.

43
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:21,328
We both know the only thing you caught
was a chill.

44
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,330
Some people just don't understand.

45
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:26,211
It's the thrill of the chase,
not the size of the trophy.

46
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:27,619
Oh.

47
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:30,787
I keep telling you to weight your flies,
but you never listen.

48
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:32,997
Dead drift is the only way
to catch 'em in the winter,

49
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:35,836
but no, you keep trying
to get 'em to chase up high.

50
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:38,564
Says the woman who couldn't tie a nymph
if her life depended on it.

51
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:41,465
Lucky for me, it doesn't.
Are you gonna discard anytime soon?

52
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:44,774
I did, five minutes ago.
How about more play and less yappin'?

53
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:50,808
What are you lookin' at?

54
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:54,983
Connie and her gaggle of gossip queens.

55
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:58,948
They couldn't stitch their way
out of a paper bag.

56
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:01,950
Someone sounds a little bitter.

57
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:03,453
That's ridiculous.

58
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:11,290
Muriel St. Claire. Who's she think
she's fooling with that name?

59
00:04:12,543 --> 00:04:14,633
A lot of actors change their names.

60
00:04:14,712 --> 00:04:17,302
So do criminals, Vernon. So do criminals.

61
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:19,302
What'd that woman ever do to you?

62
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:20,474
Move here.

63
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:22,344
Ah.

64
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:24,513
Gin.

65
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:25,807
Oh... Oh.

66
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:27,432
Oh.

67
00:04:46,327 --> 00:04:47,197
Hi.

68
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:50,117
I saw the forecast in Virgin River.
It looks really bad.

69
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:52,876
Yeah. The, uh, power's out
and it's freezing.

70
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:55,039
How are you and Bill doing?

71
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:57,008
I'm in San Francisco for the weekend.

72
00:04:57,088 --> 00:04:58,338
We're managing.

73
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:01,472
How are you gonna stay warm
if the power's out?

74
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:04,928
Um... Ev... everybody's at Jack's Bar.

75
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:07,273
I guess he's got a... a generator.

76
00:05:07,348 --> 00:05:08,598
Well, why aren't you there?

77
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,060
Mel?

78
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:16,517
It's raining and I don't wanna drive.

79
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:18,653
You could walk there.

80
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:23,737
Mel, if you hang up,
I'm just gonna call you back.

81
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:27,535
I told Jack about Mark.

82
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:33,421
I wish I hadn't said anything.

83
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:36,037
No, it's good that you told him.

84
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,680
Mel?

85
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:57,648
I'm just not...
ready to get close to anyone.

86
00:05:58,274 --> 00:06:00,284
No one is saying that you have to.

87
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:02,818
I like him.

88
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:07,622
He seems like someone you can trust.

89
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:08,950
Yeah.

90
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:16,329
Oh, I just wish I could take it all back.

91
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:17,751
No.

92
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:21,964
Saying it out loud,
it just... makes it feel more real.

93
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:28,144
I can't believe it's been almost a year
and I'm still this messed up.

94
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:32,934
Telling Jack means you're starting
to come to terms with losing Mark.

95
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:35,728
You have to take it one step at a time.

96
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:38,227
Can I call you back?

97
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:40,357
Sure.

98
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:43,243
Hey, I love you.

99
00:06:46,697 --> 00:06:47,697
Ditto.

100
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,600
Hey.

101
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,310
Thought caffeine was a no-no.

102
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:18,685
This is decaf.

103
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:21,401
- No, it's not.
- Really? Tastes like decaf.

104
00:07:23,734 --> 00:07:24,744
Hey, Jack.

105
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:25,819
Hey, Muriel.

106
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:27,821
What can I get you?

107
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:29,621
Do you have an older brother?

108
00:07:30,366 --> 00:07:31,486
Uh, only sisters.

109
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:33,826
I guess it's gonna have to be a hot tea.

110
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:34,911
Milk and sugar, right?

111
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:37,003
You know what I like.

112
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:40,287
Oh. Hope.

113
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:41,626
How you feeling?

114
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:43,839
Poor thing,
I heard about the heart attack.

115
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:44,761
Did you now?

116
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:47,120
Yeah. I was gonna come see you, actually,
in the hospital,

117
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:49,505
but then I booked this big commercial
in Los Angeles.

118
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:51,514
- Yes, I heard.
- Did you?

119
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:53,256
You told everyone at canasta.

120
00:07:53,347 --> 00:07:54,347
Oh.

121
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:59,226
Oh! Well, I'm just so glad
that you bounced back so quickly.

122
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:01,812
I mean, at your age, you just never know.
Right?

123
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:03,228
Ahem.

124
00:08:03,774 --> 00:08:05,444
You are such a doll.

125
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:08,607
And those dimples, right? Oh.

126
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:15,035
I can't stand that woman.

127
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:16,119
Really?

128
00:08:16,412 --> 00:08:17,462
You hide it so well.

129
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:05,342
I'm very sorry.

- You're soaked. What happened?
- Ugh...

145
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:27,956
I was gonna ride out the storm
at Jo Ellen's.

146
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:29,174
Why would you do that?

147
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:31,167
I didn't wanna get caught in the rain.

148
00:10:31,255 --> 00:10:32,625
Well, you could have driven.

149
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,590
Yes, I could have done that.

150
00:10:35,676 --> 00:10:38,196
Well, standing around in wet clothes,
you're gonna catch a cold.

151
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,390
Um, that's actually a medical misnomer.

152
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:42,353
All right,
you're gonna be mighty uncomfortable.

153
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:44,271
Come upstairs,
I'll give you some of my clothes,

154
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,560
and throw these in the dryer.

155
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:47,935
Or you could stand here and freeze.

156
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:49,982
No, yeah. Please.

157
00:10:50,566 --> 00:10:51,566
Lead the way.

158
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:01,833
Well, uh...

159
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:19,717
A little big for you, but...
at least you'll be dry.

160
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:20,854
Oh, thank you.

161
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:23,675
You're welcome. Um...

162
00:11:24,308 --> 00:11:26,638
There's towels down the hall
in the bathroom.

163
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:28,645
And, um...

164
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:31,980
yeah, just flip the switch off
when you're done.

165
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:33,816
Okay. Wait. Jack.

166
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:36,355
Sorry. I just, um...

167
00:11:36,445 --> 00:11:37,525
Last night...

168
00:11:40,157 --> 00:11:41,777
I just feel like I need to explain.

169
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:43,702
Do you want to?

170
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:47,205
No.

171
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:49,332
Then don't.

172
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:54,063
I mean, your business is your business.

173
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:58,875
Come down when you're dry,
and I'll save a spot for you at the bar.

174
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:00,719
Thank you.

175
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:39,679
What? Wait a minute.

176
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:42,087
Can y'all believe this weather?

177
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:46,523
Will you please let Connie know
that I am not speaking to her?

178
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:49,233
Whoa. Whoa, whoa. Now, I have no interest

179
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:51,480
in getting into the middle
of whatever this is.

180
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:53,272
Okay?

181
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:57,281
Hope, I came over to make amends.

182
00:12:57,902 --> 00:13:02,322
Canasta tends to rile everyone up,
and for that, I'm real sorry.

183
00:13:02,406 --> 00:13:04,526
You can tell Connie
I appreciate her apology,

184
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:06,737
but we'd like to get back to our game.

185
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:08,867
Hope, can we be civil, please?

186
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:15,174
Connie, I don't know what to say,
but you know how she can be bullheaded.

187
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:20,297
The girls and I wanna make a quilt
for Lilly and baby Chloe,

188
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:23,302
and no one can cross stitch
as good as you.

189
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:27,063
It would mean a lot if you'd come over
and join us.

190
00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:33,231
Well, if I don't,
you'll have a giant mess on your hands.

191
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:34,312
Oh!

192
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:37,895
It'll mean a lot to Lilly.

193
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:44,822
Can you believe her?
She was practically groveling.

194
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:47,077
I wouldn't call that groveling.

195
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:48,489
You're coming with me.

196
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:49,867
I might need a wingman.

197
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:53,004
What did I do to deserve this?
Don't answer that.

198
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:02,008
I've never seen my clothes look so good.

199
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:06,675
You know what I miss about LA?

200
00:14:06,762 --> 00:14:09,682
Traffic? Smog? A little gun violence?

201
00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:12,226
No. The weather.

202
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:14,109
Oh, the weather.
You're not a fan of the rain?

203
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:15,517
No. Are you?

204
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:18,154
Yeah, actually. I find it peaceful.

205
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:19,942
Peaceful.

206
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:22,605
No. It's, uh... wet and noisy.

207
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:25,994
My idea of peaceful is a day at the spa.

208
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:30,201
I don't understand. People hang out here
until the storm's over, or...

209
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:32,556
They go home when it's late,
and if the power's still out,

210
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:33,900
they'll come back in the morning.

211
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:34,956
Hm.

212
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:37,417
Ahem.

213
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:42,053
- Oh. Jack, honey.
- Oh. Yeah.

214
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:44,051
Let me refill that for you. Sorry.

215
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:46,473
Oh, and a slice of apple pie,
please, and thank you?

216
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:47,972
Comin' up.

217
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:19,794
- Preach.
- Hey.

218
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:21,167
- What are you doin'?
- Nothin'.

219
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:23,253
You've been doin' nothin' all day.
We're full here.

220
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:25,467
Yeah, I'm just, uh...
just going over our invoices.

221
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:28,028
All right, well, invoices can wait.
I can't find the apple pie.

222
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:30,652
You know, there's a couple extra
in the... the back of the fridge.

223
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:32,259
I need help in the kitchen. Come on.

224
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:33,598
Yeah, okay. Comin'.

225
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:46,147
I'm surprised you own anything flannel.

226
00:15:46,236 --> 00:15:48,236
Except for maybe a set of sheets.

227
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:49,952
Oh, yeah, no, this is Jack's.

228
00:15:50,407 --> 00:15:52,027
Oh, you don't say.

229
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:54,327
Yeah. My clothes were soaked.

230
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:56,616
À la mode.

231
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:58,004
And on the house.

232
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:01,249
Such a big heart.

233
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:06,761
If you ask me, Charmaine's a damn fool
to let a guy like you get away.

234
00:16:07,424 --> 00:16:12,644
Then again, I always thought
she was a little big for her britches.

235
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:18,936
So, uh...

236
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:21,267
what happened?

237
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:24,274
Charmaine decided she didn't wanna
see me anymore.

238
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:29,279
Oh. Well, I'm sorry.

239
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:30,783
Obviously for the best.

240
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:33,655
We... we want different things, right?

241
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:35,663
- Yeah.
- Order up.

242
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:37,245
I gotta get that.

243
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:40,581
Hey, Doc.

244
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:45,211
Oh, hey, Bert.
Still comin' down out there?

245
00:16:45,754 --> 00:16:48,384
Cats, dogs... Might even be some cows.

246
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:50,298
What's Preacher cookin'?

247
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:52,854
Oh, we got a jerk chicken'll
knock your socks off.

248
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:55,511
Hi, honey bun.

249
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:57,467
- Glad to see you finally made it.
- Hi.

250
00:16:57,558 --> 00:16:59,688
Yeah, well, you were right.
My room was freezing.

251
00:16:59,768 --> 00:17:01,848
Aww. I'm sorry.

252
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:08,574
Bert, you, uh... you want a beer?

253
00:17:08,652 --> 00:17:10,532
Ah, I'm done for the day, so why not?

254
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:11,612
All right.

255
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:16,039
Broke an axle on my truck
helping somebody out of a ditch,

256
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:18,658
so my buddy in Clear River
is gonna cover for me, so...

257
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:20,546
Well, don't you worry.
The whole town is here.

258
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:22,171
- Just sit back and relax.
- Mm.

259
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,383
- I'll get you that stew, huh?
- Yeah, thanks.

260
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:28,296
Hi.

261
00:17:29,506 --> 00:17:30,966
I'm Mel Monroe.

262
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:31,880
Bert Gordon.

263
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:34,257
Bert. Yeah.
The... the tow truck driver, right?

264
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:35,934
Yes, ma'am.

265
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:38,103
You towed my car when I first got here.

266
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:42,019
It's a... a red BMW... in a ditch...

267
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:44,522
Oh, yeah, you're the big shot LA nurse.

268
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:47,605
Oh! I don't know about big shot,
but I am a nurse.

269
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:49,191
- Here you go.
- Yeah.

270
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:54,028
Um... Hey, is your hand okay?

271
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:55,114
Oh, yeah.

272
00:17:58,243 --> 00:17:59,583
Well, it looks pretty bad.

273
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:01,542
Oh, it's fine.

274
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:02,922
It doesn't look fine.

275
00:18:02,998 --> 00:18:06,958
Oh, a few days ago
I was riggin' up an abandoned vehicle.

276
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:09,963
Got my damn hand caught
when I was lowerin' the sling.

277
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:12,547
Ah, give it a few days,
it'll... it'll be as good as new.

278
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:15,643
- Have you had it looked at yet?
- Aah, it's happened before.

279
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:17,429
I bounce back. I always do, right?

280
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:20,807
- Okay. Do you want me to check it out?
- Oh, you're off the clock.

281
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:23,847
I'll be fine as long as Jack
keeps givin' me beers.

282
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:25,846
Well, I just wanna make sure
it's not broken.

283
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,400
Yeah, well, suit yourself.

284
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,780
All right.

285
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,280
- So...
- Aaah!

286
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:36,032
Okay. Yeah. Can you move this finger?

287
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:39,029
- No, not really, no.
- No.

288
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:40,198
So, what do we got?

289
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:42,325
Whoa.

290
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:43,962
Look at the size of that.

291
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:47,419
Yeah. I think he fractured
his fourth metacarpal

292
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:48,961
and possibly sprained his wrist.

293
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:51,085
Yeah, a boxer's fracture.

294
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:53,215
Do a couple rounds with a bear?

295
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:55,298
A Chevy.

296
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:56,934
He needs an X-ray.

297
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:58,760
Well, hold on a second here.

298
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:04,024
- Aah!
- Yeah, I think Mel's diagnosis is correct.

299
00:19:05,018 --> 00:19:06,098
- Thank you.
- Well.

300
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:10,066
Listen, Bert. I think you should get
to the hospital and get an X-ray for that.

301
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:11,279
Oh, no can do.

302
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:12,188
Why not?

303
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:14,295
- Well, no health insurance.
- Now, hold on. Hold on.

304
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:16,159
There's no cuts or abrasions on the skin.

305
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:18,908
It's a clean break
with not much deformity.

306
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:20,911
I think a closed reduction
would do the trick.

307
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:21,833
Hm.

308
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:22,950
What's that mean?

309
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:27,250
It means he wants to manipulate the
bone fragments back into position himself.

310
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:30,245
So, Bert, I would have to get you
over to the clinic.

311
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:33,205
- I don't wanna make a big fuss about this.
- No, no fuss.

312
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:36,047
You know, I fired up the...
the genny this morning, just in case.

313
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:39,425
Listen, Bert.
If your bone doesn't heal properly,

314
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:41,431
you could lose full function of your hand.

315
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:46,063
Yeah. So, I'll go gather my things
and we'll head over there, all right?

316
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:47,143
You too.

317
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:50,192
Hey, Doc. Ahem, Doc.

318
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:54,646
That's your second whiskey, right?

319
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:56,074
Yeah.

320
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:57,993
It is Sunday.

321
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:06,370
Yeah.

322
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:08,207
Okay, I got your point, son.

323
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:11,711
Besides, we need you here
in case there's an emergency, yeah?

324
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:14,840
Why don't you let Mel take care of Bert?

325
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:19,091
Ahem.

326
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:22,640
You have done
a closed reduction before, right?

327
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:23,601
Several. Yeah.

328
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,850
Okay. So, why don't you take care of this?

329
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:27,893
And I'll, uh... I'll be stayin' here, hm?

330
00:20:27,976 --> 00:20:29,226
You... You're not gonna come?

331
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:31,861
Well, you're certainly capable
of handling this, right?

332
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:33,269
Of course. I... Of course.

333
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:38,197
Yeah. Well, then, just make sure
that you splint the MCP at at least...

334
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:40,408
Sixty degrees from flexion. I know. But...

335
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:41,699
Good. Good.

336
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:42,990
All right?

337
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:45,333
Just report back to me when you're done.

338
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:48,961
- Mel will take good care of you.
- Oh.

339
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:51,539
Okay.

340
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:53,754
Um, I just don't have my car.

341
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:55,085
I'm happy to drive.

342
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:57,344
Why don't I grab us some coats?

343
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:58,422
Okay.

344
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:02,141
You're gonna be fine.

345
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:27,535
Hey, Bert, why don't you hop up
on the exam table?

346
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,170
So, you're just gonna
push my bone back together?

347
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:38,416
Well, I'm gonna give you something
for the pain, first.

348
00:21:38,505 --> 00:21:40,165
You know, doing this now,

349
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:42,717
you can most likely avoid having surgery
in the future.

350
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:45,681
Ah, hell will freeze over before I let
a stranger cut me up with a knife.

351
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:49,061
Exactly,
which is why we're doing this. All right?

352
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:51,684
Okay.

353
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:53,272
Hold your hand out.

354
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:56,606
Okay.
Now, this is gonna sting a little bit.

355
00:21:59,234 --> 00:22:00,994
Yeah. I never got a chance to tell you

356
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:03,449
how sorry I was
I didn't get to you in time that night.

357
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:04,360
What?

358
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:08,368
You and Jack bein' kidnapped
and held up at that camp, it's...

359
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:11,248
If I'd only gotten there sooner, you know?

360
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,250
Oh, no. It... it all turned out okay.

361
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:17,918
Oh, no. I called the bar
when I should have called the sheriff.

362
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:21,213
I just thought somebody picked you up
and gave you a ride.

363
00:22:21,923 --> 00:22:23,133
Bert, really, it's okay.

364
00:22:23,216 --> 00:22:25,636
No, I... I should have gone out
and looked for you.

365
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:27,719
It's okay.
You had no way of knowing what happened.

366
00:22:37,814 --> 00:22:39,824
I went out to the farm yesterday.

367
00:22:40,275 --> 00:22:42,775
And Lilly is doing so well.

368
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:44,700
Yeah.

369
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:47,620
That doctor in Clear River
is really doing the trick.

370
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:49,948
And Chloe is getting so big.

371
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:54,829
Hope, dear, you know, a running stitch
would be much more efficient.

372
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:56,455
A rocking stitch is cleaner.

373
00:22:56,541 --> 00:23:00,711
Well, I guess we could always give Chloe
her quilt for her sixteenth birthday.

374
00:23:01,129 --> 00:23:03,169
- Ahem.
- I'm just gonna get some more iced tea.

375
00:23:03,256 --> 00:23:04,256
Dry mouth.

376
00:23:04,841 --> 00:23:07,261
Wasn't that one of the side effects
of the incontinence pills

377
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:09,104
that you were shilling
in your commercial?

378
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:12,135
Doc, can I get you anything while I'm up?

379
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:13,224
He's fine.

380
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:15,102
- Huh?
- What?

381
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:16,865
I'm concerned
about the poor girl's health.

382
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:17,895
Mm-hm.

383
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:24,360
Um...

384
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:26,567
So...

385
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:30,115
For the love of Pete,
don't just stand there.

386
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,450
Spit it out, son.

387
00:23:31,701 --> 00:23:34,661
Uh, there's someone outside
who wants to see you.

388
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:36,866
- Well, tell whoever it is to come in.
- Well, they...

389
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:38,997
- They want you to come outside.
- Who is it?

390
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:40,424
I'm not supposed to say.

391
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:41,672
Are you kidding me?

392
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:43,803
Okay, she says it's really important.

393
00:23:45,632 --> 00:23:48,262
Mother of pearl.
Do I have to do everything in this town?

394
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:51,934
I'll be right back.

395
00:23:52,889 --> 00:23:55,139
- Where are you goin'?
- Outside.

396
00:23:57,769 --> 00:23:58,979
My seat's not even cold.

397
00:23:59,062 --> 00:24:00,232
Mm-hm!

398
00:24:01,064 --> 00:24:02,944
Is that a new cologne you're wearing?

399
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,900
- No.
- Oh, you sure smell good.

400
00:24:06,069 --> 00:24:07,909
What's the, uh...
what's the name of the scent?

401
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:08,946
Soap.

402
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:28,631
Oh! What's with all the secrecy?

403
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:30,337
Jack and I broke up.

404
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:34,057
Honey, that's no secret.
Everyone in town is talking about it.

405
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:35,473
Oh.

406
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:38,234
Well, I... I wanna give him his stuff back.

407
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:39,310
So, what's stopping you?

408
00:24:39,394 --> 00:24:40,564
I... I don't wanna see him.

409
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:43,895
Ugh. He's not here.
Just put whatever it is in his office.

410
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:46,742
I... I don't wanna see anyone right now.

411
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:54,530
- There... there's a letter inside.
- Oh, no. No, no.

412
00:24:54,618 --> 00:24:56,788
- I'm not getting in the middle.
- Since when?

413
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:59,000
You're always knee-deep
in everybody's business.

414
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,620
I offer advice.

415
00:25:02,959 --> 00:25:03,959
Please.

416
00:25:05,545 --> 00:25:07,875
It... it'll be easier for Jack this way.

417
00:25:09,382 --> 00:25:12,012
I know we haven't always been close,
but...

418
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:16,808
I figured... you'd know
what I was going through.

419
00:25:19,267 --> 00:25:20,267
Please.

420
00:25:21,311 --> 00:25:23,981
I can't have his stuff lying around.
It's too hard.

421
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:29,817
Every instinct in my body
is telling me I'm making a mistake.

422
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:31,613
Thank you.

423
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:35,370
Be careful out there in this.

424
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:36,490
Oh, thanks.

Believe me when I tell you,
you don't wanna know.

431
00:26:23,498 --> 00:26:24,998
Hey, hey, hey. Whoa.

432
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:26,293
Whoa.

433
00:26:27,502 --> 00:26:29,052
Road's washed out, Preacher.

434
00:26:30,213 --> 00:26:31,553
Just gotta ride out the storm.

435
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:34,182
Yeah, well, you best do it in your car.

436
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:36,468
I ain't here to cause trouble, Preach.

437
00:26:37,512 --> 00:26:39,192
I'll be leavin'
as soon as the road's open.

438
00:26:40,223 --> 00:26:42,103
Just need a drink, and a...

439
00:26:43,393 --> 00:26:44,523
warm place to sit.

440
00:26:46,062 --> 00:26:47,062
What can I get you?

441
00:26:51,526 --> 00:26:53,236
Bring him a bourbon and a check.

442
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:54,948
He ain't stayin' long.

443
00:26:55,989 --> 00:26:57,699
- That'll do.
- Sure thing.

444
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:05,496
Keep that glass full, son. That's for you.

445
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:12,512
You bet.

446
00:27:16,926 --> 00:27:18,406
You see the knot that guy's carrying?

447
00:27:20,972 --> 00:27:21,972
It's dirty money.

448
00:27:38,698 --> 00:27:39,698
All right.

449
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:41,075
There you go.

450
00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:43,202
Okay.

451
00:27:43,453 --> 00:27:46,583
I'm gonna need you to take two of these
every four hours with food.

452
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:48,934
They're not very strong,
but it'll help with the swelling.

453
00:27:48,958 --> 00:27:51,979
I'm gonna call Grace Valley Hospital.
I want you to get an X-ray of the hand.

454
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:53,633
I told you, I don't have insurance.

455
00:27:53,713 --> 00:27:55,923
Oh, I think Doc
can figure somethin' out for you.

456
00:27:56,466 --> 00:27:59,046
Well, thanks. I look forward
to repayin' your kindness, ma'am.

457
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:01,684
I'm gonna give Shirley a call.

458
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:03,433
She's gonna be happy about this.

459
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:06,765
- Tell her we'll give you a ride home.
- Expect a cobbler comin' your way.

460
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:12,361
Hey, um...

461
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:14,651
I was thinkin' maybe since,

462
00:28:14,734 --> 00:28:17,704
you know, we're already out,
I've got something I'd like to show you.

463
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:19,069
Um... Okay.

464
00:28:19,155 --> 00:28:22,195
Well, I... I'm just not really that
comfortable driving around in the rain.

465
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:25,164
Okay, well, I got a four-wheel drive.
It's not far.

466
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:28,708
I just... I think you're gonna like it.

467
00:28:33,628 --> 00:28:36,458
Now, look, you can't stonewall me forever.

468
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:37,668
Who wanted to talk to you?

469
00:28:37,757 --> 00:28:39,967
God, you're just as nosy as I am.

470
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:41,261
Oh, yeah.

471
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:43,054
All right, fine. Fine. Don't tell me.

472
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:44,850
It was Charmaine.

473
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:49,354
- Is she okay?
- She seems to be doing okay, considering.

474
00:28:49,936 --> 00:28:51,226
What's... what's in the box?

475
00:28:53,773 --> 00:28:55,613
- Jack's things.
- Oh.

476
00:28:56,192 --> 00:29:00,412
- She doesn't wanna see him face to face.
- Yeah, well, give Jack the box.

477
00:29:03,199 --> 00:29:05,289
- Vernon.
- What?

478
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:22,295
What if it's something bad?

479
00:29:22,385 --> 00:29:24,635
Whatever it is, it's Jack's business.

480
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:26,101
There's a letter.

481
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:27,721
Oh, sweet Jesus.

482
00:29:27,807 --> 00:29:29,847
She told me to make sure he gets it.

483
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:32,694
Right. Right. Jack. Not you. Jack.

484
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:33,771
Oh!

485
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:36,315
Hey, Honest Abe, no one's making you stay.

486
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:39,069
I'm not leaving you alone with this box.

487
00:29:39,152 --> 00:29:40,862
I should open it.

488
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:41,985
You should not.

489
00:29:42,071 --> 00:29:44,281
Look, Hope,
you are crossing an ethical boundary.

490
00:29:44,365 --> 00:29:45,985
What's the worst that can happen?

491
00:29:46,659 --> 00:29:50,039
If you had not opened my mail,
then we would still be together.

492
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:54,831
So, my never knowing you cheated on me
would be an acceptable solution for you?

493
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:57,208
No, no. I would have told you,

494
00:29:57,295 --> 00:29:59,795
but I would have picked
the right time and place,

495
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:02,221
and maybe things wouldn't have become
so explosive.

496
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,840
- It wouldn't have changed anything.
- It might have.

497
00:30:04,928 --> 00:30:07,678
I wrote that letter
for Charmaine's mother, not you.

498
00:30:07,764 --> 00:30:09,894
And Charmaine wrote this letter for Jack.

499
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:10,984
Just Jack.

500
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:12,689
But it's not sealed.

501
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:14,349
Oh, as if that would stop you.

502
00:30:14,437 --> 00:30:16,857
- It might have, but we'll never know.
- Uh...

503
00:30:19,901 --> 00:30:21,651
What... what? What does it say?

504
00:30:22,195 --> 00:30:23,655
Hope. What?

505
00:30:23,738 --> 00:30:24,988
- Let's go.
- What is it?

506
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:26,175
- Let's just go.
- What is it?

507
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:27,239
We're going.

508
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:41,880
I don't understand why
Bert feels so guilty.

509
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:45,216
He's not responsible for what happened.

510
00:30:46,052 --> 00:30:49,352
Well, guilt isn't always
a rational emotion.

511
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,810
Can we not do this?

512
00:30:55,603 --> 00:30:57,233
Let's just do one.

513
00:30:57,313 --> 00:30:59,073
One more round of IVF.

514
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:02,235
Mark, when we lost our baby,

515
00:31:02,318 --> 00:31:04,038
you promised me
we could have another child.

516
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:06,202
- Because I believed that we could.
- And we can.

517
00:31:07,824 --> 00:31:10,874
I see this all the time with my patients,
okay?

518
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:13,662
If we just keep trying, there is a chance.

519
00:31:13,746 --> 00:31:14,866
Please just reconsider.

520
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:16,286
Sweetheart, you and I,

521
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:19,921
our marriage is the thing that matters,
okay?

522
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:20,923
Our marriage.

523
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:24,344
All I've ever wanted is you.
All I've ever needed has been...

524
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:25,844
Honey, I love you.

525
00:31:29,178 --> 00:31:31,508
You know, they say death is final,
but it isn't.

526
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:37,654
For the people left behind,

527
00:31:40,189 --> 00:31:42,109
the pain feels like it never ends.

528
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:54,788
I thought that moving here,
away from everything that made me sad,

529
00:31:57,707 --> 00:31:59,747
would somehow be freeing, but...

530
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:05,837
I just... brought all my sadness with me.

531
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:13,390
Mel, I'm so sorry.

532
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:21,064
Look, I wish there was... something
I could say to make you feel better.

533
00:32:24,525 --> 00:32:25,525
It's okay.

534
00:32:27,695 --> 00:32:29,415
We can just go back to the bar,
if you want.

535
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:30,817
No, no, no, no. I wanna go.

536
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:33,156
You sure?

537
00:32:33,242 --> 00:32:34,242
Yeah.

538
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:39,371
All righty, then.

539
00:32:52,553 --> 00:32:54,973
You are honestly not gonna tell me
what is in that letter?

540
00:32:55,056 --> 00:32:58,226
- I don't wanna get you involved.
- Well, it's a little late for that.

541
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:01,021
What are you gonna do?

542
00:33:01,854 --> 00:33:03,484
What I always do. Fix it.

543
00:33:03,564 --> 00:33:06,574
Uh... No. Look.
This is the last time I'm gonna say this.

544
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:10,241
It is best to let Jack
handle his own business.

545
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:11,571
No, I can't.

546
00:33:11,906 --> 00:33:13,866
I need to do what's best for Jack.

547
00:33:33,636 --> 00:33:34,636
Another round?

548
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:35,971
I gotta go.

549
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:37,723
No, I'm good.

550
00:33:38,474 --> 00:33:39,984
Rain's stopped. Roads are open.

551
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:43,862
Uh, you're all paid up.

552
00:33:44,814 --> 00:33:45,824
That's for you.

553
00:33:47,233 --> 00:33:48,233
Listen, uh...

554
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:51,074
you wanna make some real money...

555
00:33:53,156 --> 00:33:54,156
hit me up.

556
00:33:55,283 --> 00:33:57,453
I could always use another good man.

557
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:40,834
Kidnapping.

558
00:34:48,294 --> 00:34:49,294
Jack?

559
00:34:49,545 --> 00:34:50,545
Not Jack.

560
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:56,005
I'm sorry to come by so late.

561
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:59,564
I was just wondering if I could store
some of my pies in your refrigerator.

562
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:03,138
If the power doesn't come back on soon,
then they're gonna go bad.

563
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:05,098
Yeah. Huh.

564
00:35:05,311 --> 00:35:06,561
They're just in my car.

565
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:09,654
- Yeah, okay.
- Oh, thank you so much.

566
00:35:09,732 --> 00:35:11,192
Um, I only have about half a dozen,

567
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:13,462
so they shouldn't take up too much space
in your fridge.

568
00:35:13,486 --> 00:35:14,816
I'll make room on a shelf.

569
00:35:14,904 --> 00:35:15,904
Okay, thanks.

570
00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:17,906
Hey, who's Michelle?

571
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:33,707
Close your eyes.

572
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:35,222
Seriously?

573
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:36,633
Yeah.

574
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:40,854
This better be worth it.

575
00:35:41,722 --> 00:35:42,722
All right.

576
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,100
Almost there.

577
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:54,067
Wait there one second.

578
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:55,152
Okay.

579
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:03,330
All right.

580
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:05,831
- Oh, jeez.
- Just keep your eyes closed.

581
00:36:05,913 --> 00:36:07,793
- Okay.
- I'm gonna carry you down.

582
00:36:07,874 --> 00:36:09,084
One step.

583
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:10,167
Yep. Ah.

584
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,210
Okay.

585
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:13,667
Come this way.

586
00:36:14,046 --> 00:36:15,626
- Don't drop me.
- No, I got you.

587
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:20,260
Okay.

588
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:22,384
All right. Now you wait there.
Just keep 'em closed.

589
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:23,510
- Okay.
- Stay there.

590
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:24,598
Okay.

591
00:36:30,479 --> 00:36:31,479
Okay, open your eyes.

592
00:36:40,948 --> 00:36:43,278
Oh, my gosh.

593
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:47,249
Did...

594
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:48,330
Did you do this?

595
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,250
I had some help.

596
00:36:52,919 --> 00:36:54,499
Ricky, and occasionally Brady.

597
00:36:57,173 --> 00:36:58,423
Do you like it?

598
00:36:58,507 --> 00:36:59,507
Yes!

599
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:01,511
- Here.
- I can't believe it.

600
00:37:03,763 --> 00:37:04,853

00:37:05,181 --> 00:37:06,391
