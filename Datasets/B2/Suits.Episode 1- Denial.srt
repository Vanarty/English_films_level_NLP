and never bunted an eye.

694
00:24:59,721 --> 00:25:01,121
- Bunted?
- Yes, bunted.

695
00:25:01,156 --> 00:25:02,223
You have a problem
with my words now?

696
00:25:02,257 --> 00:25:03,557
Okay, Louis, I don't know if you

697
00:25:03,592 --> 00:25:05,072
skipped your afternoon prunie
or what,

698
00:25:05,093 --> 00:25:06,560
but you're making me
feel uncomfortable.

699
00:25:06,595 --> 00:25:08,195
(Louis) Well, let's get
something straight.

700
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:10,431
I'm not here to
make your life comfortable.

701
00:25:10,465 --> 00:25:12,600
You're here to do that for me.

702
00:25:12,634 --> 00:25:14,235
And the next time you print
something to the wrong copier,

703
00:25:14,269 --> 00:25:16,203
get it yourself.

704
00:25:16,238 --> 00:25:20,574
♪ ♪

705
00:25:20,609 --> 00:25:23,377
I gave you one job...
To find every single one

706
00:25:23,411 --> 00:25:25,312
of Slattery's creditors,
and you screwed it up.

707
00:25:25,347 --> 00:25:27,181
- What are you talking about?
- You left one off the list,

708
00:25:27,215 --> 00:25:29,917
and as soon as they realize that
we bought out everyone else,

709
00:25:29,951 --> 00:25:32,486
they'll know we have a deal
and they'll call in their debt

710
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:33,854
and the whole thing
will blow up.

711
00:25:33,888 --> 00:25:35,456
Wait a second, they haven't
even called it in yet?

712
00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:36,657
No, they haven't
called it in yet,

713
00:25:36,691 --> 00:25:38,192
because they're gonna wait
till the last second

714
00:25:38,226 --> 00:25:39,506
so they can hold us
over a barrel

715
00:25:39,527 --> 00:25:41,028
because you didn't do your job.

716
00:25:41,062 --> 00:25:43,230
And now I gotta find some
leverage on Katzen Financial.

717
00:25:43,265 --> 00:25:44,465
I didn't miss Katzen Financial.

718
00:25:44,499 --> 00:25:45,766
Then why weren't they
on the list?

719
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:49,603
I don't know, they were
on the list when I sent it...

720
00:25:49,638 --> 00:25:51,138
Goddamn Rachel.

721
00:25:51,172 --> 00:25:52,573
Harvey!

722
00:25:52,607 --> 00:25:54,141
Katzen was the last name
on that list

723
00:25:54,175 --> 00:25:55,943
and the only name on that page,
all right?

724
00:25:55,977 --> 00:25:57,544
The printer must have just
run out of paper.

725
00:25:57,579 --> 00:25:58,746
This isn't Rachel's fault.

726
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:00,814
What am I supposed to tell
Kevin Slattery?

727
00:26:00,849 --> 00:26:02,216
"The reason you're losing
your company

728
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:03,784
is because my associate
didn't load the printer"?

729
00:26:03,818 --> 00:26:05,286
I don't know, how about
you tell him the truth?

730
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:06,687
That the reason he may
lose his company

731
00:26:06,721 --> 00:26:08,355
is because you didn't hire
a secretary.

732
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:09,623
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

733
00:26:09,658 --> 00:26:11,025
You know what it means.
Rachel has been killing herself

734
00:26:11,059 --> 00:26:12,826
to take care of you,
and we haven't said anything

735
00:26:12,861 --> 00:26:14,762
because we both agreed
to cut you some slack.

736
00:26:14,796 --> 00:26:16,030
- We?
- Yeah, we,

737
00:26:16,064 --> 00:26:17,298
but I'm not gonna let you
come down on her

738
00:26:17,332 --> 00:26:19,033
for screwing up something
that wasn't her job.

739
00:26:19,067 --> 00:26:20,701
Her job is to do what I say,

740
00:26:20,735 --> 00:26:22,303
and you better wrap your head
around that.

741
00:26:22,337 --> 00:26:23,904
No, Harvey you better wrap
your head around the fact

742
00:26:23,938 --> 00:26:25,806
that Donna is gone and
she is not coming back.

743
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,442
And I told you, it's not
gonna last with her and Louis.

744
00:26:28,476 --> 00:26:31,645
You keep saying that,
but all I see is Donna

745
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:34,481
outside Louis's office
and no one outside yours.

746
00:26:34,516 --> 00:26:37,484
So you better swallow your pride
and ask her for help,

747
00:26:37,519 --> 00:26:40,354
or hire a new secretary,
but either way,

748
00:26:40,388 --> 00:26:43,190
you're done taking it out
on Rachel.

Barely.

752
00:26:54,495 --> 00:26:57,864
I need those two weeks
you offered me before.

753
00:26:57,898 --> 00:26:59,165
I'm afraid
it's too late for that.

754
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,200
Donna, I'm drowning.

755
00:27:00,234 --> 00:27:01,601
This whole thing
with the Slattery deal is...

756
00:27:01,635 --> 00:27:03,636
I'm sorry about your deal,
Harvey, but you should have

757
00:27:03,671 --> 00:27:05,538
thought about that
before you turned me down.

758
00:27:05,573 --> 00:27:06,839
So you're punishing me?

759
00:27:06,874 --> 00:27:08,441
I'm not punishing you.

760
00:27:08,475 --> 00:27:10,243
But I have a mountain of work,
and even if I didn't,

761
00:27:10,277 --> 00:27:11,778
how do you think Louis
would feel if I suddenly

762
00:27:11,812 --> 00:27:12,972
started working for you again?

763
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:15,081
I don't give a shit
how Louis feels.

764
00:27:15,115 --> 00:27:16,783
Well, what about how I feel?

765
00:27:16,817 --> 00:27:18,618
Which is that you're trying
to undermine my decision.

766
00:27:18,652 --> 00:27:21,254
How the hell am I trying
to undermine your decision?

767
00:27:21,288 --> 00:27:24,057
What do you call this?

768
00:27:24,091 --> 00:27:25,992
That... that was before...

769
00:27:26,026 --> 00:27:28,061
Before what?
Before you ran into Louis?

770
00:27:28,095 --> 00:27:29,929
Before you needed my help?
What?

771
00:27:29,964 --> 00:27:30,897
Donna...

772
00:27:30,931 --> 00:27:32,232
Do you know where I found this?

773
00:27:32,266 --> 00:27:34,100
Louis put it right on top
of the list of secretaries

774
00:27:34,134 --> 00:27:37,303
that I have been keeping for you
because I still care about you,

775
00:27:37,338 --> 00:27:38,905
and you know what they both did?

776
00:27:38,939 --> 00:27:40,740
They fed right into
his nightmare

777
00:27:40,774 --> 00:27:41,708
that I'm gonna leave him,

778
00:27:41,742 --> 00:27:43,022
which is exactly
what you wanted.

779
00:27:43,043 --> 00:27:46,012
Do you know how hard it is
for me

00:27:46,046 --> 00:27:49,115
to swallow my pride
and come over here?

781
00:27:49,149 --> 00:27:51,317
Do you know how hard it is
for me to say no to you?

782
00:27:51,352 --> 00:27:52,652
(Harvey)
Then don't.

783
00:27:52,686 --> 00:27:54,754
I am asking you
for one little thing.

784
00:27:54,788 --> 00:27:56,522
No, Harvey, it's not
one little thing.

785
00:27:56,557 --> 00:27:58,992
Today it's the Slattery deal,
tomorrow's the Weiss merger,

786
00:27:59,026 --> 00:28:00,226
and then the day after that,

787
00:28:00,261 --> 00:28:01,427
it will be
a million other things

788
00:28:01,462 --> 00:28:04,697
until you think everything is
back to normal.

789
00:28:04,732 --> 00:28:06,866
(Donna) Well, it's not.
This is the new normal.

I could help you, but I can't.

I don't... I don't want
to talk about it.

799

is talking about it.

(Dr. Agard)
And what did you do?

804
00:28:41,635 --> 00:28:42,935
(Harvey)
You know what I did.

805
00:28:42,970 --> 00:28:45,071
(Dr. Agard) No, I know.
I need you to say it.

806
00:28:45,105 --> 00:28:46,572
Why?

untied, two guys laugh...

815
00:29:18,272 --> 00:29:19,839

00:29:30,317 --> 00:29:32,051
Yeah.

822
00:29:32,086 --> 00:29:34,620
And you made up a story
about having trouble sleeping

00:29:34,655 --> 00:29:38,091
to get antianxiety medication,

824
00:29:38,125 --> 00:29:40,727
and you've been taking
a pill a day since.

825
00:29:40,761 --> 00:29:41,761
Yes.

Right here on top,
"replacements for Louis."

832
00:30:02,583 --> 00:30:05,785
That's because that's the list
I made after Norma died.

833
00:30:05,819 --> 00:30:07,286
Then why do you still have it?

834
00:30:07,321 --> 00:30:09,389
Because I was saving it
for Harvey.

835
00:30:09,423 --> 00:30:10,590
This is for Harvey?

836
00:30:10,624 --> 00:30:13,693
Yes, Louis, because I work
for you now,

837
00:30:13,727 --> 00:30:15,828
and I'd like to tell you
to stop questioning

838
00:30:15,863 --> 00:30:17,196
whether I'm gonna
change my mind,

839
00:30:17,231 --> 00:30:18,911
but we both know
that's never gonna happen,

840
00:30:18,932 --> 00:30:23,035
so instead, I'll say...

841
00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:24,771
you need to talk to me about it
when it does.

842
00:30:24,805 --> 00:30:26,739
But I did talk to you, Donna.

843
00:30:26,774 --> 00:30:28,975
First, I loaded you up
with work, then I yelled at you,

844
00:30:29,009 --> 00:30:30,810
and then I put the can-opener
on top of that list.

845
00:30:30,844 --> 00:30:32,211
I mean, I can't be
more direct than that.

846
00:30:32,246 --> 00:30:35,047
Yes, you can, Louis.

847
00:30:35,082 --> 00:30:37,683
Because I don't want that kind
of relationship anymore.

848
00:30:37,718 --> 00:30:39,786
What's it for?

849
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:40,820
What's what for?

850
00:30:40,854 --> 00:30:44,891
(Louis)
The can opener.

851
00:30:44,925 --> 00:30:46,359
It's just a can opener, Louis.

852
00:30:46,393 --> 00:30:48,327
No, it's not.

853
00:30:48,362 --> 00:30:51,164
Harvey was sending me a message
when he gave it to me.

854
00:30:51,198 --> 00:30:53,166
That message wasn't meant
for you.

855
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,400
It was meant for me.

856
00:30:54,435 --> 00:30:55,768
Donna, you want me
to talk to you,

857
00:30:55,803 --> 00:31:00,473
but now you're not
talking to me.

858
00:31:00,507 --> 00:31:02,809
It was a ritual
that Harvey and I would do

859
00:31:02,843 --> 00:31:04,210
before we went to trial.

860
00:31:04,244 --> 00:31:06,479
So the message was,

861
00:31:06,513 --> 00:31:11,150
Donna, you'll never have
something like that with me.

862
00:31:11,185 --> 00:31:12,265
No, Louis, that's not what...
