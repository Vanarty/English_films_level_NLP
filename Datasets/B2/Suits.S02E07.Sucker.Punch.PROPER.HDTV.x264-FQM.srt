1
00:00:00,382 --> 00:00:03,038
So you did have the document
from Coastal Motors?

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,690
- Objection.
- Harvey, you're the defendant.

3
00:00:06,757 --> 00:00:08,758
I wasn't objecting
to his question.

4
00:00:08,826 --> 00:00:09,926
Just his tie.

5
00:00:09,994 --> 00:00:12,495
I do have to look at it,
you know.

6
00:00:12,563 --> 00:00:14,531
This is fun, isn't it, Harv?

7
00:00:14,598 --> 00:00:16,566
Hanging out, catching up,

8
00:00:16,634 --> 00:00:17,701
learning about your fraud.

9
00:00:17,768 --> 00:00:19,636
I hate to burst your bubble,
Trav,

10
00:00:19,704 --> 00:00:21,204
but there was no fraud.

11
00:00:21,272 --> 00:00:22,339
There was no fraud. What?

12
00:00:22,406 --> 00:00:23,540
You just said,
you had the document.

13
00:00:23,607 --> 00:00:25,208
Yes. We went back through
the case files.

14
00:00:25,276 --> 00:00:27,210
Found the report. Whoops.

15
00:00:27,278 --> 00:00:28,945
That's it. "Whoops"?

16
00:00:29,013 --> 00:00:31,147
Hope, you got that.

17
00:00:31,215 --> 00:00:34,317
"Whoops"?
Your defense is "whoops"?

18
00:00:34,385 --> 00:00:35,785
All right,
you've made your point.

19
00:00:35,853 --> 00:00:38,121
You made us a settlement offer
that we would never take.

20
00:00:38,189 --> 00:00:39,723
Let's talk about
one that we would.

21
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:41,991
This is a deposition,
not a settlement meeting.

22
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:43,693
Every meeting
is a settlement meeting.

23
00:00:43,761 --> 00:00:45,261
Fine.

24
00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:47,797
The offer was 5 million,
and Harvey gets disbarred.

25
00:00:47,865 --> 00:00:51,034
How about $100 million?

26
00:00:51,102 --> 00:00:53,269
And Harvey gets disbarred.

27
00:00:53,337 --> 00:00:55,271
Tanner, you want to take
this to court, go right ahead.

28
00:00:55,339 --> 00:00:57,207
I'd rather watch her
cut you down

29
00:00:57,274 --> 00:00:58,775
than see her cut a deal anyway.

30
00:00:58,843 --> 00:00:59,943
You know, I see why hairdo

31
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:01,478
wants to roll the dice,
but why you?

32
00:01:01,545 --> 00:01:04,247
You just went from
5 million to 100 million,

33
00:01:04,315 --> 00:01:05,849
and you're questioning
why I don't want to settle.

34
00:01:05,916 --> 00:01:07,117
If that's a sticking point,

35
00:01:07,184 --> 00:01:08,518
I might be able to go to
0 million.

36
00:01:08,586 --> 00:01:10,320
But the one thing
I won't budge on is

37
00:01:10,388 --> 00:01:12,122
he gets disbarred.

38
00:01:12,189 --> 00:01:14,090
I think I'm doing you a favor.

39
00:01:14,158 --> 00:01:15,325
And what does he...

40
00:01:15,393 --> 00:01:17,127
cause a headache like this once,
twice a month?

41
00:01:17,194 --> 00:01:18,261
Doesn't matter,

42
00:01:18,329 --> 00:01:19,262
'cause he cures more
than he makes,

43
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:20,330
like when you stuck your nose

44
00:01:20,398 --> 00:01:22,132
into my case last year,
and he beat you.

45
00:01:22,199 --> 00:01:23,233
Crushed him.

46
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:24,401
Then he took his ball
and went home.

47
00:01:24,468 --> 00:01:26,269
- Should've stayed there.
- Look at that.

48
00:01:26,337 --> 00:01:27,704
Finishing
each other's sentences.

49
00:01:27,772 --> 00:01:28,972
How cute.

50
00:01:29,039 --> 00:01:31,408
No wonder you won't throw him
under the bus.

51
00:01:31,475 --> 00:01:32,675
Good for you, Harvey.

52
00:01:32,743 --> 00:01:34,144
I mean,

53
00:01:34,211 --> 00:01:36,179
you're throwing her
under the bus.

54
00:01:36,247 --> 00:01:37,180
Watch yourself, Tanner.

55
00:01:37,248 --> 00:01:38,548
Oh, what's the matter, Harv?

56
00:01:38,616 --> 00:01:40,517
Did I offend
your delicate sensibilities?

57
00:01:40,584 --> 00:01:42,218
You want to take
your ball and go home?

58
00:01:42,286 --> 00:01:43,286
I'm gonna take my ball

59
00:01:43,354 --> 00:01:44,220
and shove it up your... Harvey.

60
00:01:44,288 --> 00:01:45,789
Of course.

61
00:01:45,856 --> 00:01:49,793
Your coif ed hair,
your pretty nails.

62
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,395
See? She's the man,
and you're the girl.

63
00:01:52,463 --> 00:01:54,330
You know, it's funny.

64
00:01:54,398 --> 00:01:55,732
I would have thought
she'd prefer someone like...

65
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,933
This deposition is over.

66
00:01:57,001 --> 00:01:58,802
Now what? Is mommy
gonna take you home now?

67
00:02:01,138 --> 00:02:03,840
Wait. That's it.

68
00:02:03,908 --> 00:02:06,943
You got a thing for mommy.

69
00:02:07,011 --> 00:02:08,878
And now it all makes sense.

70
00:02:08,946 --> 00:02:11,181
Because I actually
looked into your mommy,

71
00:02:11,248 --> 00:02:13,249
and it turns out
that the whole time

72
00:02:13,317 --> 00:02:15,018
you were home with daddy,
mommy was out banging...

73
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:19,024
Subtitles downloaded from Podnapisi.NET.

74
00:02:26,964 --> 00:02:29,499
Point, Tanner.

75
00:02:29,567 --> 00:02:34,904
I'll see you in court, Harv.

76
00:02:40,778 --> 00:02:42,712
So when did the plan change

77
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:44,781
from trying to settle
to punching Tanner in the face?

78
00:02:44,849 --> 00:02:46,416
He didn't seem to want
to do the one,

79
00:02:46,484 --> 00:02:47,984
so I did the other.

80
00:02:48,052 --> 00:02:50,053
That's funny.

81
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,287
But he got under your skin,

82
00:02:51,355 --> 00:02:52,856
and that can't happen
when we go to trial.

83
00:02:52,923 --> 00:02:55,358
- It won't.
- Not if you're prepared.

84
00:02:55,426 --> 00:02:56,893
Are you suggesting a trial run?

85
00:02:56,961 --> 00:02:58,728
I don't want
a trial at all but...

86
00:03:00,998 --> 00:03:02,298
We already know your position
is to cut me loose.

87
00:03:02,366 --> 00:03:03,733
Not you. No.

88
00:03:03,801 --> 00:03:05,001
I'm just one of many partners

89
00:03:05,069 --> 00:03:06,369
who don't know what to think.

90
00:03:06,437 --> 00:03:08,271
And if they don't know
you didn't do it,

91
00:03:08,339 --> 00:03:11,040
how is a jury gonna feel?

92
00:03:11,108 --> 00:03:12,709
You're betting everything
on this trial.

93
00:03:12,776 --> 00:03:15,478
Better make damn sure
you can win.

94
00:03:17,114 --> 00:03:18,515
He's an asshole.

95
00:03:18,582 --> 00:03:20,717
He's right.

96
00:03:20,784 --> 00:03:21,985
All right, what?

97
00:03:22,052 --> 00:03:23,152
If we're gonna do this,

98
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:24,954
I don't want to waste the chance

99
00:03:25,022 --> 00:03:26,189
to tune you up,

100
00:03:26,257 --> 00:03:28,691
but that means we need
a damn good Tanner.

101
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:29,692
Are you saying I'm rusty?

102
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,727
When was the last time

103
00:03:30,794 --> 00:03:33,796
you were in the ring?

104
00:03:33,864 --> 00:03:36,366
We don't need a good Tanner.

105
00:03:36,433 --> 00:03:38,535
We need a nasty Tanner.

106
00:03:38,602 --> 00:03:40,003
Someone who will do anything
to beat me.

107
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:42,872
Someone who makes you want
to punch him in the face.

108
00:03:45,943 --> 00:03:47,510
Oh, you want me to do what?

109
00:03:47,578 --> 00:03:49,245
I just told you four times.

110
00:03:49,313 --> 00:03:50,947
I want you to play Tanner.
No, no, no.

111
00:03:51,015 --> 00:03:52,315
I'm... I was a little distracted
because I was reading.

112
00:03:52,383 --> 00:03:53,449
Can you just repeat it
one more time?

113
00:03:53,517 --> 00:03:54,951
Look, Louis,
you've had your fun.

114
00:03:55,019 --> 00:03:58,021
When I said the ground rules
were to knock me off my game,

115
00:03:58,088 --> 00:03:59,155
I was talking about the trial.

116
00:03:59,223 --> 00:04:00,490
I know what
you're talking about.

117
00:04:00,558 --> 00:04:01,591
You didn't come to me
because I'm an idiot.

118
00:04:01,659 --> 00:04:02,926
No, not because you're one,

119
00:04:02,993 --> 00:04:04,160
in spite of you being one.

120
00:04:04,228 --> 00:04:06,529
I'm the man for the job,
and you know it.

121
00:04:06,597 --> 00:04:08,331
Actually, I had you
at number five on my list.

122
00:04:08,399 --> 00:04:09,332
And what did Jessica
have me at?

123
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,333
Six.

124
00:04:10,401 --> 00:04:11,334
Okay. I get it. I get it.

125
00:04:11,402 --> 00:04:12,368
You're trying to make me mad.

126
00:04:12,436 --> 00:04:13,770
No, I'm trying
to make you good.

127
00:04:13,837 --> 00:04:15,705
You see, the one thing
you have in common

128
00:04:15,773 --> 00:04:17,073
with Tanner
is your hatred of me.

129
00:04:17,141 --> 00:04:18,241
That is true.

130
00:04:18,309 --> 00:04:20,109
But what you don't have
are his skills.

131
00:04:20,177 --> 00:04:21,878
But that's okay.
I'll go to somebody else.

132
00:04:21,946 --> 00:04:24,547
Wait, Harvey. Stop.

133
00:04:24,615 --> 00:04:26,849
You don't think I can win?

134
00:04:26,917 --> 00:04:29,986
I know you can't.

135
00:04:30,054 --> 00:04:32,589
This isn't some bank loan,
junior.

136
00:04:32,656 --> 00:04:34,357
Get out.

137
00:04:34,425 --> 00:04:36,359
I've got a trial to prepare for.

138
00:04:36,427 --> 00:04:37,427
And you know what?

139
00:04:37,494 --> 00:04:38,428
When you lose,

140
00:04:38,495 --> 00:04:39,729
do not come crying to me,

141
00:04:39,797 --> 00:04:41,030
because there's nothing
on this earth

142
00:04:41,098 --> 00:04:42,465
that would be sacred enough
to stop me

143
00:04:42,533 --> 00:04:45,268
from shoving your ass
in the goddamn ground.

144
00:04:45,336 --> 00:04:46,469
Good.

145
00:04:46,537 --> 00:04:48,271
Because those are
the real ground rules.

146
00:04:48,339 --> 00:04:49,672
Oh, I see.

147
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:51,441
Now, you're asking
to get lit up.

148
00:04:51,508 --> 00:04:53,710
Somebody wants to get lit up.

149
00:04:53,777 --> 00:04:57,413
? See the money,
wanna stay for your meal ?

150
00:04:57,481 --> 00:05:00,750
? Get another piece of pie
for your wife ?

151
00:05:00,818 --> 00:05:03,920
? Everybody wanna know
how it feel ?

152
00:05:03,988 --> 00:05:07,624
? Everybody wanna see
what it's like ?

153
00:05:07,691 --> 00:05:10,593
? Living in a beehive
of your mind ?

154
00:05:10,661 --> 00:05:14,597
? Me and missus
so busy, busy making money ?

155
00:05:14,665 --> 00:05:16,065
? All right

156
00:05:16,133 --> 00:05:21,571
? all that time imagine this ?

157
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:23,160
? The greenback boogie

158
00:05:28,275 --> 00:05:31,010
Messages,
color coded by urgency.

159
00:05:31,078 --> 00:05:32,545
Has Donna called back?

160
00:05:32,613 --> 00:05:35,014
She would be red, so...

161
00:05:35,082 --> 00:05:36,215
No.

162
00:05:36,283 --> 00:05:37,149
Then those would all be
the same shade

163
00:05:37,217 --> 00:05:38,150
of I-don't-give-a-shit.

164
00:05:38,218 --> 00:05:40,453
Call her again. Yes.

165
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,454
So?

166
00:05:41,521 --> 00:05:42,855
How was it?

167
00:05:42,923 --> 00:05:44,390
- How was what?
- Punching Tanner.

168
00:05:44,458 --> 00:05:45,958
It was awesome, wasn't it?
Tell me it was awesome.

169
00:05:46,026 --> 00:05:47,193
What are you, in middle school?

170
00:05:47,261 --> 00:05:49,829
I'm in the middle of a trial.
A mock trial.

171
00:05:49,897 --> 00:05:51,130
Mock trials are for children.

172
00:05:51,198 --> 00:05:52,665
The adults are doing
an in-house trial run.

173
00:05:52,733 --> 00:05:55,001
Okay. Mock trial, trial run.

174
00:05:55,068 --> 00:05:57,069
Po-tay-to, po-tah-to,
not potato.

175
00:05:57,137 --> 00:05:58,271
What do you need me to do?

176
00:05:58,338 --> 00:05:59,739
What he needs you to do
is help me.

177
00:05:59,806 --> 00:06:01,173
What's this?

178
00:06:01,241 --> 00:06:02,275
You've been drafted.

179
00:06:02,342 --> 00:06:03,409
Okay, what round?

180
00:06:03,477 --> 00:06:05,111
Excuse me?

181
00:06:05,178 --> 00:06:06,445
Sports metaphor.

182
00:06:06,513 --> 00:06:08,547
Oh, it's not tennis. Sports.

183
00:06:08,615 --> 00:06:10,182
You've been assigned
by the judge to help me

184
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:12,218
in pretty boy's trial.

185
00:06:12,286 --> 00:06:13,853
Oh, look at that,
he thinks I'm pretty.

186
00:06:13,921 --> 00:06:16,155
Wait, what judge?

187
00:06:16,223 --> 00:06:17,256
His honor, Daniel Hardman.

188
00:06:17,324 --> 00:06:19,892
I'll see you in court,
sweet tits.

189
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,294
No, no. He can't.

190
00:06:21,361 --> 00:06:22,295
- He can.
- I'm not...

191
00:06:22,362 --> 00:06:23,396
- You are.
- Harvey...

192
00:06:23,463 --> 00:06:25,164
Listen, Louis is devious,

193
00:06:25,232 --> 00:06:26,399
confident, and intelligent.

194
00:06:26,466 --> 00:06:29,502
You forgot ugly, lazy,
and disrespectful.

195
00:06:29,569 --> 00:06:31,170
Now is not the time to quote
<i>The Breakfast Club.</i>

196
00:06:31,238 --> 00:06:33,439
Oh, you mess with the bully,
you get the horn.

197
00:06:33,507 --> 00:06:34,807
Stop it. This trial is no joke.

198
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:37,143
Jessica's going against
Muhammad Ali.

199
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:38,144
She better be able

200
00:06:38,211 --> 00:06:39,445
to beat Joe Frazier.

201
00:06:39,513 --> 00:06:41,881
Louis is no Joe Frazier.
Okay. I get it.

202
00:06:41,949 --> 00:06:44,617
You want me to help
Louis think outside the box.

203
00:06:44,685 --> 00:06:46,419
Exactly. Now, how would
you come after me?

204
00:06:46,486 --> 00:06:48,721
- Well, first of all...
- Don't tell me, tell Louis.

205
00:06:48,789 --> 00:06:50,056
Because you and I
are not discussing

206
00:06:50,123 --> 00:06:51,991
this trial during this trial.

207
00:06:52,059 --> 00:06:53,359
Oh, and you were right.

208
00:06:53,427 --> 00:06:56,162
I know. About what?

209
00:06:56,229 --> 00:06:59,899
Tanner. It was awesome.

210
00:07:10,043 --> 00:07:11,610
Guess you're not going
to let me win.

211
00:07:11,678 --> 00:07:12,712
Have I ever?

212
00:07:12,779 --> 00:07:13,879
Would I know?

213
00:07:13,947 --> 00:07:16,816
Doubtful.

214
00:07:16,883 --> 00:07:17,717
Have you ever? I am right now.

215
00:07:19,653 --> 00:07:21,320
Rule number 27:

216
00:07:21,388 --> 00:07:25,424
Never beat the person
you're trying to close.

217
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:28,728
I always hated rule number 27.

218
00:07:28,795 --> 00:07:30,563
You couldn't close me
five years ago.

219
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:32,064
What makes you think
you've got a shot tonight?

220
00:07:32,132 --> 00:07:33,065
Didn't.

221
00:07:33,133 --> 00:07:34,200
Not couldn't.

222
00:07:34,267 --> 00:07:35,234
And five years ago,

223
00:07:35,302 --> 00:07:36,235
it wasn't your legal services

224
00:07:36,303 --> 00:07:38,204
I was interested in.

225
00:07:38,271 --> 00:07:40,439
How does Jessica feel
about an employee

226
00:07:40,507 --> 00:07:42,341
who resigned coming back
to consult?

227
00:07:42,409 --> 00:07:43,809
She's on board.

228
00:07:43,877 --> 00:07:44,810
Do you mean
I have to convince her?

229
00:07:44,878 --> 00:07:45,811
See that?

230
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:47,279
That's why I want you.

231
00:07:47,347 --> 00:07:50,182
You could've told me
all this on the phone.

232
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:52,351
Well, I wanted
to see you first.

233
00:07:52,419 --> 00:07:56,022
Make sure things weren't...
awkward.

234
00:07:56,089 --> 00:07:57,223
You know, because...

235
00:07:57,290 --> 00:07:59,992
"I didn't call you back
five years ago"?

236
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,094
Oops.

237
00:08:02,162 --> 00:08:04,230
You think you didn't call me
back five years ago?

238
00:08:04,297 --> 00:08:06,799
Oh, I know I didn't call you
back five years ago.

239
00:08:06,867 --> 00:08:08,901
Well, I hope
your jury consulting

240
00:08:08,969 --> 00:08:10,136
is better than your memory.

241
00:08:10,203 --> 00:08:11,937
I guess we'll have to agree
to disagree.

242
00:08:12,005 --> 00:08:13,205
Because you know I'm right.

243
00:08:13,273 --> 00:08:15,875
Because I'm a bigger person.

244
00:08:15,942 --> 00:08:20,212
Which is why I'm gonna come in.

245
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,781
But I want to know,
why'd you call me

246
00:08:21,848 --> 00:08:23,849
instead of Ted Phillips?

247
00:08:23,917 --> 00:08:25,684
Why do you think?

248
00:08:25,752 --> 00:08:28,888
They had the document.

249
00:08:28,955 --> 00:08:32,992
They kept it to themselves,
and then they destroyed it.

250
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:35,061
These are the facts of the case,

251
00:08:35,128 --> 00:08:37,229
and they are undisputed.

252
00:08:42,369 --> 00:08:44,136
Aren't you supposed
to be over there?

253
00:08:44,204 --> 00:08:46,172
You know, I'm just working on

254
00:08:46,239 --> 00:08:47,173
something for work. Yeah.

255
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,241
And just quoting <i>A Few Good Men.</i>

256
00:08:49,309 --> 00:08:51,877
- For work.
- I know.

257
00:08:51,945 --> 00:08:54,914
Look, I, um...

258
00:08:54,981 --> 00:08:58,284
I have to ask you.

259
00:08:58,351 --> 00:09:01,187
Do you think that
it's at all possible

260
00:09:01,254 --> 00:09:02,855
that he actually did it?

261
00:09:02,923 --> 00:09:05,524
- No, I don't.
- How do you know?

262
00:09:05,592 --> 00:09:07,426
Because I know Harvey.

263
00:09:07,494 --> 00:09:09,028
I mean, how could you think
he could do it?

264
00:09:09,096 --> 00:09:10,896
Because I don't know Harvey.

265
00:09:10,964 --> 00:09:12,965
All I know is that he thinks
he's above the rules,

266
00:09:13,033 --> 00:09:15,301
and he will do
whatever it takes to win.

267
00:09:15,368 --> 00:09:17,770
Yeah, but that doesn't mean...

268
00:09:21,074 --> 00:09:24,176
you don't think
he has integrity.

269
00:09:24,244 --> 00:09:27,279
Ah. Sorry, I have to go.

270
00:09:27,347 --> 00:09:30,182
Oh, Mike.

271
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:33,819
What happens to you
if Harvey loses?

272
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:38,424
I don't know.

273
00:09:38,492 --> 00:09:40,426
But right now, it's not my job

274
00:09:40,494 --> 00:09:42,928
to worry about him losing.

275
00:09:42,996 --> 00:09:44,730
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

276
00:09:44,798 --> 00:09:46,165
guilty is not gray.

277
00:09:46,233 --> 00:09:47,633
You either are or you aren't.

278
00:09:47,701 --> 00:09:51,303
And Harvey Specter is guilty
of concealing that document.

279
00:09:51,371 --> 00:09:54,740
It's a good opening.
It's not good enough.

280
00:09:54,808 --> 00:09:56,208
Says his lap dog.

281
00:09:56,276 --> 00:09:58,277
Says the guy who knows
how to beat him.

282
00:09:58,345 --> 00:10:00,079
I'm listening.

283
00:10:00,147 --> 00:10:01,213
How?

284
00:10:01,281 --> 00:10:03,382
Don't play the odds.
Play the man.

285
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:04,884
Do you know
how Harvey beat Tanner?

286
00:10:04,951 --> 00:10:06,051
No.

287
00:10:06,119 --> 00:10:07,119
He threatened to commit
perjury to win.

288
00:10:07,187 --> 00:10:09,188
Of course, it's classic Harvey.

289
00:10:09,256 --> 00:10:10,189
He was bluffing.

290
00:10:10,257 --> 00:10:11,891
But Tanner didn't know that,

291
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:13,259
and Harvey used against him.

292
00:10:13,326 --> 00:10:15,060
What's your point?

293
00:10:15,128 --> 00:10:16,629
My point is you said
classic Harvey

294
00:10:16,696 --> 00:10:18,164
before you even knew
he was bluffing

295
00:10:18,231 --> 00:10:20,266
because you don't think
Harvey has any integrity.

296
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:21,734
Nobody thinks
Harvey has integrity.

297
00:10:21,801 --> 00:10:22,902
So then use that

298
00:10:22,969 --> 00:10:26,939
against him.

299
00:10:27,007 --> 00:10:30,809
Easier said than done. Thanks.

300
00:10:30,877 --> 00:10:32,645
Yeah. No, you're right.

301
00:10:32,712 --> 00:10:34,013
Maybe it would just be easier

302
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,581
to bug his office
with a dictaphone.

303
00:10:35,649 --> 00:10:38,651
Then use that to get ahead.

304
00:10:38,718 --> 00:10:41,086
I did not use it
for that reason.

305
00:10:41,154 --> 00:10:43,856
Yes, you did, because you are
a devious son of a bitch.

306
00:10:43,924 --> 00:10:45,758
- How dare you...
- Shut up. You know it.

307
00:10:45,825 --> 00:10:47,293
I know it. Everybody knows it.

308
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,962
I did what I did for
the integrity of the firm.

309
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:51,130
Then why didn't you take it

310
00:10:51,198 --> 00:10:52,598
to the managing partner
of the firm?

311
00:10:52,666 --> 00:10:53,766
Daniel had a right to know.

312
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:55,034
And Jessica had a right
to tell him,

313
00:10:55,101 --> 00:10:56,135
but you told him.

314
00:10:56,203 --> 00:10:57,469
You sought out Hardman

315
00:10:57,537 --> 00:10:59,605
because if he comes out on top,
you want him to owe you.

316
00:10:59,673 --> 00:11:01,473
He was there when I heard it.

317
00:11:01,541 --> 00:11:03,275
He asked, I told him.

318
00:11:03,343 --> 00:11:04,910
Oh, so he asked
if Harvey had a secret?

319
00:11:04,978 --> 00:11:07,079
- No, he didn't.
- So then you volunteered it.

320
00:11:07,147 --> 00:11:08,814
Which is as good
as seeking it out.

321
00:11:08,882 --> 00:11:10,416
Devious. You weren't there.

322
00:11:10,483 --> 00:11:12,351
You don't know.
You're twisting what happened.

323
00:11:12,419 --> 00:11:14,887
Which is exactly
what you need to do to Harvey.

324
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,434
How long have you been waiting?

325
00:11:28,501 --> 00:11:30,236
How long were
you gonna ignore my calls?

326
00:11:30,303 --> 00:11:32,371
Last I checked,
you haven't called.

327
00:11:32,439 --> 00:11:34,306
I've left you ten voicemails
in the last week.

328
00:11:34,374 --> 00:11:35,674
Huh, that's so weird.

329
00:11:35,742 --> 00:11:36,809
I seem to remember
your assistant

330
00:11:36,876 --> 00:11:39,111
leaving me ten voice mails.

331
00:11:39,179 --> 00:11:40,913
You know I don't know
how to dial out.

332
00:11:40,981 --> 00:11:42,381
Is it eight? Is it nine?

333
00:11:42,449 --> 00:11:43,649
Do you know
how to use your cell phone?

334
00:11:43,717 --> 00:11:45,251
Because if I were
your assistant,

335
00:11:45,318 --> 00:11:46,785
I would have totally programmed
my phone number into it.

336
00:11:46,853 --> 00:11:48,520
Oh, wait.

337
00:11:48,588 --> 00:11:51,457
I did.
When I was your assistant.

338
00:11:51,524 --> 00:11:53,259
Okay, look. I'm an asshole.

339
00:11:53,326 --> 00:11:54,893
Did you come here to
tell me things I already know?

340
00:11:54,961 --> 00:11:58,130
No, I came here to see
how you're doing.

341
00:11:58,198 --> 00:12:01,066
You came to get me
to do the trial run.

342
00:12:01,134 --> 00:12:03,035
Donna, it's important.

343
00:12:03,103 --> 00:12:04,136
Yeah, important for me
to get up there and say

344
00:12:04,204 --> 00:12:06,138
I screwed up
trying to protect you?

345
00:12:06,206 --> 00:12:07,473
You did screw up.

346
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:09,475
Yes. To protect you.

347
00:12:09,542 --> 00:12:11,010
Which I never asked you to do.

348
00:12:11,077 --> 00:12:12,745
No, you just expected me
to do it.

349
00:12:12,812 --> 00:12:15,381
Like I expected
you to fight for me.

350
00:12:15,448 --> 00:12:17,049
- I did.
- Really?

351
00:12:17,117 --> 00:12:18,384
Like you fought for Mike?

352
00:12:18,451 --> 00:12:20,052
Because that fight,
you somehow managed to win.

353
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,421
Oh, and when you thought
he needed to be fired,

354
00:12:22,489 --> 00:12:25,291
you respected him enough
to do it yourself.

355
00:12:25,358 --> 00:12:28,227
Jessica insisted that
she be the one to let you go.

356
00:12:28,295 --> 00:12:30,829
And since when have you ever
done anything Jessica wanted

357
00:12:30,897 --> 00:12:34,133
if it wasn't
what you wanted too?

358
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:37,069
Donna, I need you there.

359
00:12:37,137 --> 00:12:40,673
I need you to tell them
that I didn't do this.

360
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:42,574
I'm sorry, I can't.

361
00:12:42,642 --> 00:12:45,010
I've hired an attorney.

362
00:12:45,078 --> 00:12:46,879
If this thing goes to trial,
I'm gonna be taking the fifth.

363
00:12:46,946 --> 00:12:48,480
So if you need another Donna
at the firm,

364
00:12:48,548 --> 00:12:50,582
just have anybody say,
"I decline to answer,"

365
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:52,885
because that's all you're
gonna get out of me anyway.

366
00:12:52,952 --> 00:12:55,321
- Donna.
- I decline to answer.

367
00:12:55,388 --> 00:12:59,358
Really? Really?

368
00:13:08,066 --> 00:13:09,807
You don't get
my kind of track record

369
00:13:09,808 --> 00:13:11,042
just by moneyballing people.

370
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:12,810
She's the me
of jury consulting.

371
00:13:12,878 --> 00:13:14,912
Don't sell me short, Harvey.
I'm trying to close a deal here.

372
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:16,948
What kind
of jury would you pick?

373
00:13:17,016 --> 00:13:18,616
I already did. You need men.

374
00:13:18,684 --> 00:13:19,984
That's a mistake.
Women love me.

375
00:13:20,052 --> 00:13:21,085
Really?

376
00:13:21,153 --> 00:13:22,220
Because I showed them
your photo,

377
00:13:22,287 --> 00:13:24,188
and they described you
as arrogant,

378
00:13:24,256 --> 00:13:26,124
conceited, cocky...

379
00:13:26,191 --> 00:13:27,492
Oh, and arrogant again.

380
00:13:27,559 --> 00:13:28,926
What about handsome?

381
00:13:28,994 --> 00:13:30,228
Did I not mention arrogant?

382
00:13:30,295 --> 00:13:31,462
It's not bragging if it's true.

383
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:34,599
- Yes, it is.
- Yes, it is.

384
00:13:34,667 --> 00:13:36,334
Zoe, I'm still not convinced

385
00:13:36,402 --> 00:13:38,536
I should hire you
instead of Ted Phillips.

386
00:13:38,604 --> 00:13:41,205
After all, Harvey never tried
to sleep with Ted Phillips.

387
00:13:41,273 --> 00:13:42,940
Who says I never tried to
sleep with Ted Phillips?

388
00:13:43,008 --> 00:13:45,410
I can do what Ted can't.

389
00:13:45,477 --> 00:13:47,178
Hardman came back.
You're in his chair.

390
00:13:47,246 --> 00:13:49,313
He doesn't like that.
You told her?

391
00:13:49,381 --> 00:13:50,515
I didn't have to.

392
00:13:50,582 --> 00:13:53,418
The partners
don't know what to think.

393
00:13:53,485 --> 00:13:54,585
We don't just need to convince

394
00:13:54,653 --> 00:13:55,787
a jury I'm innocent.

395
00:13:55,854 --> 00:13:57,488
We need to convince
them I'm innocent.

396
00:13:57,556 --> 00:13:58,723
Because if they don't
trust Harvey...

397
00:13:58,791 --> 00:13:59,824
They don't trust me.

398
00:13:59,892 --> 00:14:01,025
And if they don't trust you,

399
00:14:01,093 --> 00:14:03,327
and it ever comes to a vote,
he'll win.

400
00:14:03,395 --> 00:14:05,563
She's worked here.
She knows the other partners.

401
00:14:05,631 --> 00:14:06,564
She can read them.

402
00:14:06,632 --> 00:14:08,166
And I also know Hardman.

403
00:14:08,233 --> 00:14:10,068
I never liked him.

404
00:14:10,135 --> 00:14:12,770
I won't tell Hardman
what I tell you.

405
00:14:15,641 --> 00:14:20,078
Welcome back, Zoe.

406
00:14:23,382 --> 00:14:25,416
Please state your name.

407
00:14:25,484 --> 00:14:27,218
Harvey Specter.

408
00:14:27,286 --> 00:14:28,352
Your full name.

409
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:30,855
Harvey Reginald Specter.

410
00:14:34,693 --> 00:14:36,527
Do you consider yourself
a liar, Mr. Specter?

411
00:14:36,595 --> 00:14:37,528
Of course not.

412
00:14:37,596 --> 00:14:39,030
Didn't you recently confess

413
00:14:39,098 --> 00:14:40,765
that as an associate

414
00:14:40,833 --> 00:14:42,967
you hid an important file

415
00:14:43,035 --> 00:14:44,702
belonging to a...

416
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:46,337
ooh, what was his name?

417
00:14:46,405 --> 00:14:47,538
Oh, yeah, a Louis Litt.

418
00:14:49,041 --> 00:14:50,742
That was a prank.

419
00:14:50,809 --> 00:14:51,876
It was a one-time thing.

420
00:14:51,944 --> 00:14:53,611
So you didn't do
anything wrong?

421
00:14:53,679 --> 00:14:55,179
I don't think so.

422
00:14:55,247 --> 00:14:56,414
And when asked,

423
00:14:56,482 --> 00:14:57,582
did you claim that

424
00:14:57,649 --> 00:14:59,484
you knew nothing about it? Yes.

425
00:14:59,551 --> 00:15:00,485
Did you ever do anything

426
00:15:00,552 --> 00:15:01,686
to remedy the situation?

427
00:15:01,754 --> 00:15:02,787
- No.
- Why not?

428
00:15:02,855 --> 00:15:04,055
What was done was done.

429
00:15:04,123 --> 00:15:05,456
"What was done was done."

430
00:15:05,524 --> 00:15:08,059
And like you said,
it was a one-time thing, right?

431
00:15:08,127 --> 00:15:11,529
- Yes.
- Ah. Was it?

432
00:15:11,597 --> 00:15:14,365
Because I think
maybe this is a pattern.

433
00:15:14,433 --> 00:15:15,800
Information was hidden,

434
00:15:15,868 --> 00:15:17,401
you claim
you knew nothing about it,

435
00:15:17,469 --> 00:15:19,403
you did nothing to rectify
the situation,

436
00:15:19,471 --> 00:15:22,840
and years later, you maintain
you've done nothing wrong.

437
00:15:22,908 --> 00:15:24,175
Your Honor, he's testifying.

438
00:15:24,243 --> 00:15:26,344
Sounds exactly the same
as why we're here today.

439
00:15:26,411 --> 00:15:27,845
Except there's
one big difference.

440
00:15:27,913 --> 00:15:28,846
- Your Honor...
- This time...

441
00:15:28,914 --> 00:15:32,817
A man was killed.

442
00:15:35,454 --> 00:15:39,023
No further questions,
Your Honor.

443
00:15:39,091 --> 00:15:42,326
What's done is done, right?

444
00:15:43,595 --> 00:15:47,231
The plaintiff calls
Ms. Donna Paulsen.

445
00:15:49,234 --> 00:15:51,702
Ms. Paulsen, did Harvey Specter

446
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:53,738
order you to shred
this document?

447
00:15:53,806 --> 00:15:57,508
I decline to answer pursuant
to my fifth amendment rights.

448
00:15:57,576 --> 00:16:00,011
So you don't want
to take this opportunity

449
00:16:00,078 --> 00:16:01,412
to state
your employer's innocence?

450
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,080
- Objection.
- You can't object.

451
00:16:03,148 --> 00:16:04,749
- Jessica will.
- Could you just...

452
00:16:04,817 --> 00:16:06,717
Sorry. Yeah.

453
00:16:06,785 --> 00:16:08,586
Ms. Paulsen, do you consider
yourself good at your job?

454
00:16:08,654 --> 00:16:09,954
I do.

455
00:16:10,022 --> 00:16:12,356
Have you ever stated
to one Rachel Zane

456
00:16:12,424 --> 00:16:16,093
that you are indeed the best
legal secretary in the city?

457
00:16:16,161 --> 00:16:17,595
Mike, you can't.

458
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:19,564
Donna, I can.

459
00:16:19,631 --> 00:16:21,499
Yes.

460
00:16:21,567 --> 00:16:23,501
Ms. Paulsen,
there was a personal date stamp

461
00:16:23,569 --> 00:16:25,036
from five years ago
on the document

462
00:16:25,103 --> 00:16:26,904
that you're accused
of shredding.

463
00:16:26,972 --> 00:16:28,739
Was it yours?
I decline to answer.

464
00:16:28,807 --> 00:16:30,241
Did it look
like your date stamp?

465
00:16:30,309 --> 00:16:31,475
I decline to answer.

466
00:16:31,543 --> 00:16:33,044
Okay. Then let me ask you this.

467
00:16:33,111 --> 00:16:35,079
Would you believe
that the best legal secretary

468
00:16:35,147 --> 00:16:37,248
in the city
didn't know about a document,

469
00:16:37,316 --> 00:16:40,284
even though it had what appeared
to be her date stamp on it?

470
00:16:40,352 --> 00:16:43,120
I decline to answer.

471
00:16:43,188 --> 00:16:45,590
And would you believe that
that same secretary

472
00:16:45,657 --> 00:16:47,291
would have destroyed
that document

473
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:51,462
without explicit orders
from her boss?

474
00:16:54,299 --> 00:16:58,135
This is gonna be bad, isn't it?

475
00:17:00,505 --> 00:17:02,006
Donna's gonna be great.
Just follow the script.

476
00:17:02,074 --> 00:17:03,341
Well, Rachel's not Donna.

477
00:17:03,408 --> 00:17:04,775
She's not guilty,
and she can't be rattled.

478
00:17:04,843 --> 00:17:06,210
You see how I rattled Harvey?

479
00:17:06,278 --> 00:17:08,946
The jury listens to words,
but they respond to fear.

480
00:17:09,014 --> 00:17:11,148
And we don't have that...

481
00:17:11,216 --> 00:17:12,717
Yet.

482
00:17:12,784 --> 00:17:14,252
- What's this?
- Subpoena.

483
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:16,320
You want to depose me?

484
00:17:16,388 --> 00:17:17,889
Okay, let's stop playing
<i>tiptoe through the tulips</i>

485
00:17:17,956 --> 00:17:18,990
around the elephant
in the room.

486
00:17:19,057 --> 00:17:20,124
That's not a thing.

487
00:17:20,192 --> 00:17:21,058
You know some things
about Harvey,

488
00:17:21,126 --> 00:17:22,293
and I need to know them too.

489
00:17:22,361 --> 00:17:24,195
You yourself said
go after the man.

490
00:17:24,263 --> 00:17:26,330
What better way to go after the
man than to question the boy?

491
00:17:26,398 --> 00:17:27,598
But I don't know anything
about this case.

492
00:17:27,666 --> 00:17:30,101
That's an evasive answer, Mike.

493
00:17:30,168 --> 00:17:31,836
You're hiding something,
and I smell fear.

494
00:17:31,904 --> 00:17:32,970
I have to go to the restroom.

495
00:17:33,038 --> 00:17:34,939
Wait a minute. How bad is it?

496
00:17:35,007 --> 00:17:37,875
Is it uncomfortable?
Well, now it is.

497
00:17:37,943 --> 00:17:39,343
Good.

498
00:17:39,411 --> 00:17:42,847
What. Whoa, whoa.

499
00:17:42,915 --> 00:17:43,881
Is that a polygraph?

500
00:17:43,949 --> 00:17:44,949
- Yes.
- Nope.

501
00:17:45,017 --> 00:17:45,983
You are under oath.

502
00:17:46,051 --> 00:17:47,485
And I'll tell the truth.

503
00:17:47,552 --> 00:17:48,819
You bet your ass you will,
or I'll know.

504
00:17:50,289 --> 00:17:51,389
We'll start with an easy one.

505
00:17:51,456 --> 00:17:53,758
What's your name?

506
00:17:53,825 --> 00:17:56,160
Mike Ross.

507
00:17:56,228 --> 00:17:57,395
Where do you work?

508
00:17:57,462 --> 00:17:59,497
Pearson Hardman.

509
00:17:59,564 --> 00:18:02,900
What do you do for a living?

510
00:18:02,968 --> 00:18:04,168
I practice law.

511
00:18:04,236 --> 00:18:06,504
And where did you attend
law school?

512
00:18:10,042 --> 00:18:11,142
What? What's the matter?

513
00:18:11,209 --> 00:18:15,346
Nothing.

514
00:18:15,414 --> 00:18:18,916
- You're lying.
- No, I'm not.

515
00:18:18,984 --> 00:18:23,854
I beg to differ.

516
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:27,625
Listen to me.

517
00:18:27,693 --> 00:18:30,995
I know why the machine
says you're lying.

518
00:18:33,098 --> 00:18:34,865
You're nervous.

519
00:18:34,933 --> 00:18:36,334
You don't want
to rat out Harvey.

520
00:18:36,401 --> 00:18:37,568
I get that.

521
00:18:37,636 --> 00:18:40,538
But it's time you accept
the situation.

522
00:18:40,605 --> 00:18:43,374
This is happening,
and you're going to have

523
00:18:43,442 --> 00:18:45,543
to tell me some things
about Harvey.

524
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:46,677
I accept that.

525
00:18:46,745 --> 00:18:48,579
Then answer
the goddamn question.

526
00:18:56,822 --> 00:19:00,191
I'm proud to say that I have
a diploma from Harvard law.

527
00:19:03,161 --> 00:19:05,529
Now it's time that you accept
the situation.

528
00:19:05,597 --> 00:19:07,631
I'm not afraid of you.

529
00:19:07,699 --> 00:19:09,600
I wasn't there,

530
00:19:09,668 --> 00:19:13,537
and I don't know anything
that's gonna help this case.

531
00:19:13,605 --> 00:19:16,307
Do you want fear?

532
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:18,209
I'll get you Donna.

533
00:19:29,921 --> 00:19:31,222
The answer's no.

534
00:19:31,289 --> 00:19:34,458
I didn't even ask a question
yet.

535
00:19:34,526 --> 00:19:36,060
- Yeah, well you were going to.
- Yeah.

536
00:19:36,128 --> 00:19:37,928
And you were gonna say no, but
instead you're gonna say yes.

537
00:19:37,996 --> 00:19:39,897
Oh. That's funny 'cause I
already said no to Harvey.

538
00:19:39,965 --> 00:19:41,799
And you, my dear, are not...
Are not Harvey.

539
00:19:41,867 --> 00:19:44,301
No, I'm the guy who told you
not to destroy that document,

540
00:19:44,369 --> 00:19:45,870
and you're the girl
who promised me she wouldn't.

541
00:19:45,937 --> 00:19:48,372
- You know that I...
- Broke your promise.

542
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:51,509
Well, then I guess I just suck.

543
00:19:51,576 --> 00:19:53,711
Because I'm breaking another one
right now.

544
00:19:53,779 --> 00:19:55,179
I told my attorney
that I wouldn't talk to anybody

545
00:19:55,247 --> 00:19:56,714
at the firm
until after this was over.

546
00:19:56,782 --> 00:19:58,149
- You hired an attorney?
- Yeah.

547
00:19:58,216 --> 00:20:00,551
I'd rather not go to jail.

548
00:20:00,619 --> 00:20:03,554
I don't do roommates, and I
definitely don't do orange.

549
00:20:03,622 --> 00:20:04,922
Nobody's going to jail, Donna.

550
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:06,490
You can't guarantee that.

551
00:20:06,558 --> 00:20:08,359
You dragged me
into Harvey's office once,

552
00:20:08,427 --> 00:20:10,027
and you scold me about how much
he loves his job.

553
00:20:10,095 --> 00:20:11,662
Well, if you don't help him
prep for Tanner,

554
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:13,798
he's gonna lose in court,
he is gonna get disbarred,

555
00:20:13,865 --> 00:20:16,667
and he is never gonna be able
to do what he loves ever again.

556
00:20:16,735 --> 00:20:18,302
- That is not fair.
- No, what's not fair

557
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:20,905
is Harvey taking the blame
for your mistake.

558
00:20:20,972 --> 00:20:23,407
You know what, do whatever
your attorney wants.

559
00:20:23,475 --> 00:20:24,608
Come in. Don't come in.
Go to the movies.

560
00:20:24,676 --> 00:20:25,743
Take pilates.
I don't give a shit.

561
00:20:25,811 --> 00:20:27,945
Because whatever you do,

562
00:20:28,013 --> 00:20:30,948
you're gonna regret it
for the rest of your life.

563
00:20:39,727 --> 00:20:40,763
Complainant would like to call.

564
00:20:40,764 --> 00:20:44,232
Ms. Jessica Pearson
to the stand.

565
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:45,767
Sidebar?

566
00:20:50,039 --> 00:20:51,606
This is just an attempt
to make Harvey's attorney

567
00:20:51,674 --> 00:20:53,208
look bad in front of the jury.

568
00:20:53,275 --> 00:20:54,809
What, you think Tanner's
gonna make you look good?

569
00:20:54,877 --> 00:20:56,011
You're a named defendant.

570
00:20:56,078 --> 00:20:57,245
He has a right to call you.

571
00:20:57,313 --> 00:20:59,814
Louis, will you excuse us
for a moment?

572
00:21:03,317 --> 00:21:05,789
You think I don't see
what you're trying to do?

573
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:08,291
You want him to undermine me
in front of the partners.

574
00:21:08,359 --> 00:21:10,326
I'm acting
in an unbiased manner.

575
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:11,461
It sure took you
a while to jump in

576
00:21:11,529 --> 00:21:12,495
when Harvey was up here.

577
00:21:12,563 --> 00:21:14,798
Oh, wait, you never jumped in.

578
00:21:14,865 --> 00:21:18,101
Jessica, you chose
to try this case.

579
00:21:18,169 --> 00:21:21,337
You could have been up here.
Instead, you're down there.

580
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:24,441
Either take a knee
or take that stand.

581
00:21:31,282 --> 00:21:33,416
Would you say it's important
to win at Pearson Hardman?

582
00:21:33,484 --> 00:21:34,651
You don't get to be one

583
00:21:34,718 --> 00:21:36,519
of the top law firms
in New York by losing.

584
00:21:36,587 --> 00:21:38,555
What about Mr. Specter?
How's his track record?

585
00:21:38,622 --> 00:21:40,256
Exceptional.
He almost always wins.

586
00:21:40,324 --> 00:21:41,791
Almost always.

587
00:21:41,859 --> 00:21:47,630
Is that why he's the youngest
senior partner in firm history?

588
00:21:47,698 --> 00:21:49,299
It's a factor.

589
00:21:49,366 --> 00:21:50,433
And how much
did the firm benefit

590
00:21:50,501 --> 00:21:53,303
with the Coastal Motors win?

591
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:55,071
I'd say the profits

592
00:21:55,139 --> 00:21:57,140
were somewhere
in the mid 8 figures.

593
00:21:57,208 --> 00:22:00,510
And if Mr. Specter had lost
those 8 figures,

594
00:22:00,578 --> 00:22:04,447
would he have still made
senior partner so young?

595
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:07,951
- No.
- Mm.

596
00:22:08,018 --> 00:22:09,786
- No, he wouldn't have.
- How much did Mr. Specter

597
00:22:09,854 --> 00:22:11,754
personally gain
as senior partner?

598
00:22:11,822 --> 00:22:13,156
Oh, it's too soon to say.

599
00:22:13,224 --> 00:22:14,691
He hasn't received
his first bonus yet.

600
00:22:14,758 --> 00:22:16,626
- Ballpark.
- No.

601
00:22:16,694 --> 00:22:19,062
Are you that ashamed
of how much you pay him?

602
00:22:19,129 --> 00:22:20,163
No.

603
00:22:20,231 --> 00:22:23,967
Well, then answer the question.

604
00:22:24,034 --> 00:22:26,069
- Millions.
- And a junior partner makes?

605
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:29,973
Much less.

606
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:34,277
So win,
and you're rewarded millions.

607
00:22:34,345 --> 00:22:38,748
Win less, and no matter
how much hard work, dedication,

608
00:22:38,816 --> 00:22:43,987
or administrative dominance
is displayed, you get nothing.

609
00:22:46,624 --> 00:22:49,726
Quite the incentive
to do whatever it takes

610
00:22:49,793 --> 00:22:52,495
to "almost always" win.

611
00:22:56,467 --> 00:22:59,903
I have to say, delicious
dinner, fantastic wine...

612
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:02,438
almost enough to make up
for the mediocre company.

613
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:05,275
Don't be too hard on yourself.
You're not mediocre.

614
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:08,144
See, that's funny, because
you were talking about me.

615
00:23:08,212 --> 00:23:10,380
There it is, the Specter smile.

616
00:23:10,447 --> 00:23:12,215
What can I say?
It came with the name.

617
00:23:12,283 --> 00:23:14,083
And you're never fully dressed
without a smile.

618
00:23:14,151 --> 00:23:15,552
Being fully dressed
is overrated.

619
00:23:15,619 --> 00:23:18,121
It is when you look like me.

620
00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:22,158
Mrs. Robinson, are you trying
to seduce me?

621
00:23:22,226 --> 00:23:24,360
Did you just call me
Mrs. Robinson?

622
00:23:24,428 --> 00:23:27,030
Okay, first of all, I'm younger
than Anne Bancroft.

623
00:23:27,097 --> 00:23:28,598
Anne Bancroft was hot.

624
00:23:28,666 --> 00:23:30,133
Which brings me
to second of all.

625
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,901
I'm hotter than Anne Bancroft.

626
00:23:31,969 --> 00:23:33,436
I'm hotter than Dustin Hoffman.

627
00:23:33,504 --> 00:23:35,471
Not in<i>Tootsie.</i>

628
00:23:37,174 --> 00:23:40,009
Are you afraid you're gonna lose
this thing?

629
00:23:40,077 --> 00:23:41,744
No.

630
00:23:41,812 --> 00:23:43,947
You should be.

631
00:23:44,014 --> 00:23:45,381
Why, because Louis
had one good direct?

632
00:23:45,449 --> 00:23:48,318
You walk through life like men
want to be you

633
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:49,986
and women want to sleep
with you.

634
00:23:50,054 --> 00:23:51,154
I don't always walk.

635
00:23:51,221 --> 00:23:52,922
Sometimes I drive fast.

636
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:54,657
And it's exactly
that kind of response

637
00:23:54,725 --> 00:23:56,626
that make the partners think
you're an ass.

638
00:23:56,694 --> 00:23:58,861
Being an ass doesn't make me
guilty of fraud.

639
00:23:58,929 --> 00:24:00,830
If they're right
about who you are,

640
00:24:00,898 --> 00:24:01,931
what would make them think

641
00:24:01,999 --> 00:24:02,966
they'd be wrong
about what you do?

642
00:24:03,033 --> 00:24:04,767
Well, why don't you tell me?

643
00:24:04,835 --> 00:24:07,337
You're the expert
on warm and fuzzies.

644
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:10,607
You want to know how I know I
wasn't the one to call you back?

645
00:24:10,674 --> 00:24:14,310
Because I know why I wasn't
the one to call you back.

646
00:24:14,378 --> 00:24:16,479
Let me guess...
you didn't like me.

647
00:24:16,547 --> 00:24:18,081
No, I did.

648
00:24:18,148 --> 00:24:20,583
But in all the time I knew you,

649
00:24:20,651 --> 00:24:23,419
you never once showed me
any vulnerability.

650
00:24:23,487 --> 00:24:25,088
I told you
how I felt about you.

651
00:24:25,155 --> 00:24:29,125
But you never showed me.

652
00:24:29,193 --> 00:24:32,128
So I had no way of knowing
it's the truth.

653
00:24:32,196 --> 00:24:34,197
And you could be telling
the truth now,

654
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:36,499
but if you don't show
the partners some emotion,

655
00:24:36,567 --> 00:24:38,368
they're not gonna believe you
either.

656
00:24:38,435 --> 00:24:41,404
What do you want me to do?
Manufacture a few tears?

657
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:42,805
Harvey,
when you're a defendant,

658
00:24:42,873 --> 00:24:45,942
you need the jury
to protect you.

659
00:24:46,010 --> 00:24:48,144
There's no way
they're ever gonna protect you

660
00:24:48,212 --> 00:24:51,681
if they don't care about you.

661
00:24:54,018 --> 00:24:56,019
The plaintiff
would like to call.

662
00:24:56,086 --> 00:24:59,355
Ms. Donna Paulsen to the stand.

663
00:25:11,135 --> 00:25:12,802
You got her to come in?

664
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:15,405
Just stick to the script.

665
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:18,408
Harvey won't know what hit him.

666
00:25:18,475 --> 00:25:21,310
Ms. Paulsen,

667
00:25:21,378 --> 00:25:25,581
did Harvey Specter order you
to shred that document?

668
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:29,752
I decline to answer pursuant
to my fifth amendment rights.

669
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:31,187
Did you put your date stamp
on that document?

670
00:25:31,255 --> 00:25:35,525
- I decline to answer.
- Um...

671
00:25:37,828 --> 00:25:39,562
I'm not gonna ask questions

672
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:43,933
that you're just gonna plead
the fifth to, so...

673
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:52,341
Had Harvey Specter asked you

674
00:25:52,409 --> 00:25:55,011
to bury something
five years ago, would you?

675
00:25:55,079 --> 00:25:56,179
He wouldn't ask me to do that.

676
00:25:56,246 --> 00:25:57,814
That's not what I asked.

677
00:25:57,881 --> 00:26:00,383
If he did, would you do it?

678
00:26:03,987 --> 00:26:06,322
Oh, see, you're pausing, which
means you're hiding something.

679
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:07,523
No, I'm not.

680
00:26:07,591 --> 00:26:09,525
See, I think
you'd do anything for him,

681
00:26:09,593 --> 00:26:11,694
and I know why.

682
00:26:11,762 --> 00:26:13,429
Is there a question?

683
00:26:13,497 --> 00:26:16,566
Do you love Harvey Specter?

684
00:26:16,633 --> 00:26:17,967
What?

685
00:26:18,035 --> 00:26:19,969
Do you love him?

686
00:26:20,037 --> 00:26:21,938
That has nothing to do with...

687
00:26:22,005 --> 00:26:23,906
It has everything to do with.

688
00:26:23,974 --> 00:26:27,443
Why did your last boyfriend
break up with you?

689
00:26:27,511 --> 00:26:30,379
Ms. Paulsen, why did he
end it with you?

690
00:26:30,447 --> 00:26:32,749
He thought that I prioritized
my work over our relationship.

691
00:26:32,816 --> 00:26:33,983
Your work?

692
00:26:34,051 --> 00:26:36,085
He asked you to choose
between him and Harvey,

693
00:26:36,153 --> 00:26:38,221
didn't he?

694
00:26:38,288 --> 00:26:41,224
- Yes.
- Who did you choose?

695
00:26:46,196 --> 00:26:47,764
- Harvey.
- Because you love him?

696
00:26:47,831 --> 00:26:48,998
Louis, stop.

697
00:26:49,066 --> 00:26:50,066
It is not that simple.

698
00:26:50,134 --> 00:26:53,069
Do you love him, yes or no?

699
00:26:53,137 --> 00:26:54,771
Answer the question. Louis.

700
00:26:54,838 --> 00:26:56,672
You're with him all the time.
Your work revolves around him.

701
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:58,007
Your life revolves around him.

702
00:26:58,075 --> 00:26:59,575
Objection, badgering.

703
00:26:59,643 --> 00:27:00,943
You don't have a boyfriend,

704
00:27:01,011 --> 00:27:02,445
but the one you did
wouldn't share you with him.

705
00:27:02,513 --> 00:27:04,080
- Your Honor!
- Please, I just need a...

706
00:27:04,148 --> 00:27:05,348
Do you love Harvey Specter?

707
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:06,582
Do you love Harvey Specter?

708
00:27:06,650 --> 00:27:09,252
That's enough!

709
00:27:25,402 --> 00:27:28,504
Donna.

710
00:27:53,397 --> 00:27:55,598
You crossed the line.

711
00:27:55,666 --> 00:27:56,732
Do not do this to me right now.

712
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,367
You humiliated Donna.

713
00:27:58,435 --> 00:28:00,603
You kept pushing and pushing her
for what, for fun?

714
00:28:00,671 --> 00:28:01,871
What, you think I enjoyed that?

715
00:28:01,939 --> 00:28:03,639
That made me sick.
You could have stopped.

716
00:28:03,707 --> 00:28:05,942
You think Tanner
would have stopped?

717
00:28:06,009 --> 00:28:09,045
Travis Tanner does not give
a shit about Donna Paulsen.

718
00:28:09,112 --> 00:28:10,780
- You are not Travis Tanner.
- I don't...

719
00:28:10,848 --> 00:28:12,648
- You did not have to do that.
- I did my job.

720
00:28:14,418 --> 00:28:18,187
You really want to beat me
that badly, huh?

721
00:28:18,255 --> 00:28:20,756
You think
this is about beating you?

722
00:28:20,824 --> 00:28:23,759
This whole thing
is about saving you.

723
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:28,164
Everyone is trying to help you
because you screwed up.

724
00:28:28,232 --> 00:28:32,001
This is all your fault.

725
00:28:32,069 --> 00:28:33,555
And what just happened

726
00:28:33,556 --> 00:28:35,040
to that beautiful woman
in there...

727
00:28:35,065 --> 00:28:36,955
that's on you...

728
00:28:39,506 --> 00:28:41,506
not me.

729
00:29:03,927 --> 00:29:04,927
Are you kidding me?

730
00:29:04,994 --> 00:29:07,229
Go home. Shoo!

731
00:29:07,297 --> 00:29:08,564
Go the hell home.

732
00:29:08,631 --> 00:29:10,032
Look, I didn't know
he was gonna do that.

733
00:29:10,099 --> 00:29:11,266
And if you had known,

734
00:29:11,334 --> 00:29:12,701
would you have done one thing
differently?

735
00:29:12,769 --> 00:29:13,869
I am so sorry.

736
00:29:13,937 --> 00:29:16,104
Bullshit. Bullshit.

737
00:29:16,172 --> 00:29:17,306
Bullshit. Bullshit.

738
00:29:17,373 --> 00:29:19,274
- Okay. Donna, I'm not...
- Harvey.

739
00:29:19,342 --> 00:29:20,676
I know.

740
00:29:20,743 --> 00:29:23,245
But you know what, sweetheart,
maybe you are.

741
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,148
And I do not mean that
as a compliment.

742
00:29:26,215 --> 00:29:27,649
Look, I did what I did
for the same reason

743
00:29:27,717 --> 00:29:30,319
you did what you did,
to help Harvey, that's all.

744
00:29:30,386 --> 00:29:32,754
Well, that worked out the same
for you as it did for me,

745
00:29:32,822 --> 00:29:34,356
because,
in case you hadn't noticed,

746
00:29:34,424 --> 00:29:36,158
in addition to screwing me,
you completely shafted Harvey.

747
00:29:36,225 --> 00:29:37,292
We had a script.

748
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,661
Wait, you trusted Louis?

749
00:29:39,729 --> 00:29:41,763
You trusted Louis?

750
00:29:41,831 --> 00:29:42,931
Yeah, I thought
he would stick to it.

751
00:29:42,999 --> 00:29:44,399
Yes. Well, he didn't.

752
00:29:44,467 --> 00:29:46,435
And you should have known that,
because that is just who he is.

753
00:29:46,502 --> 00:29:48,570
I am sorry. But I'm...

754
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,107
People are who they are.

755
00:29:52,175 --> 00:29:54,309
Thank you. Okay.

756
00:29:54,377 --> 00:29:55,510
I can fix this!

757
00:30:05,355 --> 00:30:06,922
What's all this?

758
00:30:06,990 --> 00:30:10,192
It wouldn't concern you.

759
00:30:10,259 --> 00:30:13,161
Why is that?

760
00:30:13,229 --> 00:30:14,262
Because you want to settle
even if it means

761
00:30:14,330 --> 00:30:15,764
Harvey getting disbarred.

762
00:30:15,832 --> 00:30:17,466
If he loses in court,
he'll get disbarred anyway.

763
00:30:17,533 --> 00:30:19,301
My concern is for the firm.

764
00:30:19,369 --> 00:30:21,536
It's not a personal attack
against Harvey.

765
00:30:21,604 --> 00:30:24,773
This whole thing is a personal
attack against Harvey.

766
00:30:24,841 --> 00:30:27,909
And you're gonna do something
about it?

767
00:30:29,612 --> 00:30:33,715
Tanner's cases, transcripts,
appeals, decisions.

768
00:30:33,783 --> 00:30:35,951
I know he did something illegal,
because that's who he is,

769
00:30:36,019 --> 00:30:38,153
and I'm gonna find it,
because that's who I am.

770
00:30:38,221 --> 00:30:40,489
What are you planning on doing
with it?

771
00:30:40,556 --> 00:30:42,190
Leveraging that
for a settlement?

772
00:30:42,258 --> 00:30:44,059
I'm not against settling.

773
00:30:44,127 --> 00:30:45,894
I'm against Harvey
getting disbarred.

774
00:30:45,962 --> 00:30:47,529
You really admire him.

775
00:30:47,597 --> 00:30:50,298
- I do.
- Loyalty.

776
00:30:50,366 --> 00:30:51,566
You can't buy that.

777
00:30:51,634 --> 00:30:54,503
No. You can't.

778
00:30:57,974 --> 00:31:01,376
What are you doing?

779
00:31:01,444 --> 00:31:04,746
We worked together
all night once.

780
00:31:04,814 --> 00:31:06,748
Let's do it again.

781
00:31:08,818 --> 00:31:11,987
I hope this time turns out
better than the last time.

782
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:16,391
Now we have them
right where we want them.

783
00:31:16,459 --> 00:31:17,859
Either you're better
than I thought you were,

784
00:31:17,927 --> 00:31:19,828
or you have absolutely no idea
what you're doing.

785
00:31:19,896 --> 00:31:22,831
Trust me, the partners
are starting to believe Harvey.

786
00:31:22,899 --> 00:31:24,032
Why?

787
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:25,734
Because he protected Donna.

788
00:31:25,802 --> 00:31:27,335
He was also protecting himself.

789
00:31:27,403 --> 00:31:28,737
Yes. But they didn't see that.

790
00:31:28,805 --> 00:31:32,107
They saw a man who cared
about someone else.

791
00:31:32,175 --> 00:31:34,676
His softer side.

792
00:31:34,744 --> 00:31:36,578
And we need to give them more.

793
00:31:36,646 --> 00:31:38,113
He won't want to.

794
00:31:38,181 --> 00:31:39,981
And we both know Harvey
won't do

795
00:31:40,049 --> 00:31:41,216
what he doesn't want to do.

796
00:31:41,284 --> 00:31:42,718
Everybody knows that.

797
00:31:42,785 --> 00:31:44,586
So what do we do?

798
00:31:49,926 --> 00:31:52,194
Permission to treat
the witness as hostile.

799
00:31:52,261 --> 00:31:53,261
Permission granted.

800
00:31:53,329 --> 00:31:54,930
He's hostile.

801
00:31:54,997 --> 00:31:56,231
The day we met,
you were working

802
00:31:56,299 --> 00:31:58,066
in the mail room
of this law firm.

803
00:31:58,134 --> 00:31:59,367
I don't recall that day.

804
00:31:59,435 --> 00:32:00,535
Well, let me refresh
your memory.

805
00:32:00,603 --> 00:32:02,904
An associate
had missed a filing,

806
00:32:02,972 --> 00:32:05,140
so he backdated the postage.

807
00:32:05,208 --> 00:32:06,608
You came to me,

808
00:32:06,676 --> 00:32:10,345
and you said if the firm
did not declare misconduct,

809
00:32:10,413 --> 00:32:12,180
you would report us to the D.A.

810
00:32:12,248 --> 00:32:14,583
I don't like fraud.
It's no secret.

811
00:32:14,650 --> 00:32:15,684
But what you did want
to keep secret

812
00:32:15,752 --> 00:32:17,686
was the fact that you told me.
Why?

813
00:32:17,754 --> 00:32:19,221
I didn't want
to get in trouble.

814
00:32:19,288 --> 00:32:21,323
No, you did it
because if we'd won,

815
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:23,792
an old woman
would have lost her pension.

816
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:26,294
And if anyone found out
that he was the one

817
00:32:26,362 --> 00:32:29,097
that told me,
then they'd know that you cared.

818
00:32:29,165 --> 00:32:30,465
Whatever you say.

819
00:32:30,533 --> 00:32:33,769
You pretend like you
don't care, but you do.

820
00:32:33,836 --> 00:32:35,771
You care about the people
you work with,

821
00:32:35,838 --> 00:32:38,006
you care about the people
you work for,

822
00:32:38,074 --> 00:32:41,042
and you care about every one
of your clients.

823
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:44,112
But you refuse
to let people know.

824
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:46,181
Is there a question?

825
00:32:46,249 --> 00:32:49,284
I just want to know why.

826
00:32:51,788 --> 00:32:52,988
No answer?

827
00:32:53,055 --> 00:32:54,189
Are you embarrassed?

828
00:32:54,257 --> 00:32:56,158
Nope.

829
00:32:56,225 --> 00:32:57,526
- Afraid?
- No.

830
00:32:57,593 --> 00:32:59,161
Then why?

831
00:32:59,228 --> 00:33:01,429
- Just let it go.
- You are under oath.

832
00:33:01,497 --> 00:33:03,064
Then hold me in contempt.

833
00:33:03,132 --> 00:33:05,333
For God sakes, what the hell
happened to you?

834
00:33:05,401 --> 00:33:07,936
What kind of damage
was done to you?

835
00:33:08,004 --> 00:33:11,206
Caring only makes you...

836
00:33:11,274 --> 00:33:13,308
Weak.

837
00:33:14,744 --> 00:33:20,015
They think you care,
they'll walk all over you.

838
00:33:20,082 --> 00:33:23,485
You weren't weak the day
you walked into my office.

839
00:33:23,553 --> 00:33:29,424
You were a man who believed
that to win fairly

840
00:33:29,492 --> 00:33:32,294
was more important than to win.

841
00:33:32,361 --> 00:33:35,764
And you still are.

842
00:33:35,832 --> 00:33:40,535
And I've never seen anyone
walk all over you.

843
00:33:40,603 --> 00:33:45,607
Is there a question here,
Your Honor?

844
00:33:47,977 --> 00:33:50,278
No, there isn't.

845
00:34:03,359 --> 00:34:06,127
- That whole thing your idea?
- I didn't know that story.

846
00:34:06,195 --> 00:34:08,196
I asked you a question.
Don't give me that coy bullshit.

847
00:34:08,264 --> 00:34:09,698
Excuse me?

848
00:34:09,765 --> 00:34:11,366
You said you wanted to see
through me, you did.

849
00:34:11,434 --> 00:34:14,369
The least you can do is give me
an honest answer.

850
00:34:14,437 --> 00:34:16,238
Yes, it was my idea.

851
00:34:16,305 --> 00:34:18,807
Harvey, your partners
loved what they saw in there.

852
00:34:18,875 --> 00:34:20,375
You're gonna win.

853
00:34:20,443 --> 00:34:21,943
Bravo.

854
00:34:22,011 --> 00:34:25,680
A tour de force.
I mean, that story?

855
00:34:25,748 --> 00:34:27,148
It was so great.

856
00:34:27,216 --> 00:34:29,217
But there isn't one shred
of proof it's true.

857
00:34:29,285 --> 00:34:31,019
Hostile witness, my ass.

858
00:34:31,087 --> 00:34:32,754
I mean, before that story,
we all believed you did it.

859
00:34:32,822 --> 00:34:34,623
And I ask you, ladies
and gentlemen of the jury,

860
00:34:34,690 --> 00:34:37,092
if he did commit that fraud,
how hard is it to believe

861
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:38,793
that he didn't concoct
some bullshit on the stand

862
00:34:38,861 --> 00:34:41,563
to get himself off the hook?

863
00:34:41,631 --> 00:34:42,964
That's my close.

864
00:34:44,934 --> 00:34:47,602
We have one more witness
to call.

865
00:34:50,406 --> 00:34:54,009
Mr. Litt, do you resent
Harvey Specter?

866
00:34:54,076 --> 00:34:55,610
It's complicated.

867
00:34:55,678 --> 00:34:56,878
No, it's simple.

868
00:34:56,946 --> 00:34:59,080
Do you resent him
for being better than you?

869
00:34:59,148 --> 00:35:00,916
- He's not better than me.
- I understand.

870
00:35:00,983 --> 00:35:02,984
It's so much easier
to criticize someone else

871
00:35:03,052 --> 00:35:06,888
than it is to acknowledge
your own shortcomings.

872
00:35:06,956 --> 00:35:08,590
- Shortcomings?
- Mm.

873
00:35:08,658 --> 00:35:10,125
My billables
are higher than his.

874
00:35:10,192 --> 00:35:11,793
My client list
is better than his.

875
00:35:11,861 --> 00:35:13,595
Yes, but I didn't ask you
about those things.

876
00:35:13,663 --> 00:35:15,096
What are you asking,
Ms. Pearson?

877
00:35:15,164 --> 00:35:17,966
Does the witness
resent my client?

878
00:35:21,170 --> 00:35:24,172
- Yes.
- Your own ambition aside,

879
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:28,176
do you think Harvey Specter
deserves to be senior partner?

880
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:31,980
Yes or no?

881
00:35:34,650 --> 00:35:37,085
Yes.

882
00:35:37,153 --> 00:35:38,753
Do you think
he's an excellent attorney?

883
00:35:41,324 --> 00:35:45,360
- Yes.
- And, as much as you hate him,

884
00:35:45,428 --> 00:35:47,362
do you think he committed
this fraud?

885
00:35:54,103 --> 00:35:55,103
No.

886
00:35:58,307 --> 00:36:00,909
Defense rests.

887
00:36:18,167 --> 00:36:22,571
Refusing to admit defeat
even after defeat.

888
00:36:22,638 --> 00:36:24,172
You really are like Harvey.

889
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,007
I'm not so sure
that's a good thing.

890
00:36:26,075 --> 00:36:27,476
Well, who would you rather be?

891
00:36:27,543 --> 00:36:28,777
Someone who believes
it's more important

892
00:36:28,845 --> 00:36:30,746
to win fairly than to win.

893
00:36:30,813 --> 00:36:33,815
Like I said, Harvey.

894
00:36:33,883 --> 00:36:34,983
Yeah. Not in this case.

895
00:36:35,051 --> 00:36:36,918
You both cheated.

896
00:36:36,986 --> 00:36:38,487
Excuse me?

897
00:36:38,554 --> 00:36:40,756
Louie's testimony pushed it
over the top.

898
00:36:40,823 --> 00:36:42,891
But that jury,
they didn't see Louis Litt

899
00:36:42,959 --> 00:36:45,460
believing Harvey's innocence...
they saw Travis Tanner.

900
00:36:45,528 --> 00:36:50,232
And that is never gonna happen
in court.

901
00:36:50,299 --> 00:36:55,971
You do realize that you are
chastising the managing partner.

902
00:36:56,038 --> 00:36:57,606
With all due respect,

903
00:36:57,673 --> 00:37:00,041
it's not gonna matter what you
are if Harvey gets disbarred.

904
00:37:00,109 --> 00:37:02,477
We'll find a way to win.

905
00:37:04,113 --> 00:37:06,081
You should be finding a way
to settle.

906
00:37:06,149 --> 00:37:08,350
There isn't
an acceptable offer.

907
00:37:08,417 --> 00:37:11,052
Yet.

908
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:13,889
Not just a pretty face.

909
00:37:29,605 --> 00:37:31,439
I hope you brought
a baseball bat.

910
00:37:31,507 --> 00:37:33,208
You want to go another round
with me, you're gonna need it.

911
00:37:33,276 --> 00:37:34,643
It doesn't matter what I have,

912
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:35,844
you're just gonna sucker punch
me again anyway.

913
00:37:35,912 --> 00:37:38,747
Boohoo.

914
00:37:38,815 --> 00:37:40,515
You baited me.

915
00:37:40,583 --> 00:37:43,051
You wanted to catch me
on that tape, and you know it.

916
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:45,687
That's not what I'm talking
about, and you know it.

917
00:37:45,755 --> 00:37:47,255
You want to settle?

918
00:37:47,323 --> 00:37:48,623
Let me save you some time.

919
00:37:48,691 --> 00:37:49,691
We pass.

920
00:37:49,759 --> 00:37:51,493
You can pass, you can sign it,

921
00:37:51,561 --> 00:37:52,994
or you could stick it
up your ass,

922
00:37:53,062 --> 00:37:55,697
but this is the best
you're getting.

923
00:37:55,765 --> 00:37:57,532
- This gets me off the hook.
- Nice try.

924
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:00,035
You think I don't know
this was your doing?

925
00:38:00,102 --> 00:38:02,971
Harvey, next time have the balls
to do it yourself

926
00:38:03,039 --> 00:38:04,539
instead of sending
your errand boy.

927
00:38:04,607 --> 00:38:06,274
Errand boy?

928
00:38:06,342 --> 00:38:08,276
You got what you wanted,
so stop playing dumb.

929
00:38:08,344 --> 00:38:11,246
Daniel Hardman doesn't work you.
You work him.

930
00:38:18,454 --> 00:38:20,755
- What the hell did you do?
- This is a good deal.

931
00:38:20,823 --> 00:38:23,892
A good deal that costs every
partner at this firm $100,000.

932
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:25,293
Including me.

933
00:38:25,361 --> 00:38:27,128
We share the profits;
We share the losses.

934
00:38:27,196 --> 00:38:29,331
There won't be a loss
when I win this at trial.

935
00:38:29,398 --> 00:38:32,400
The only reason
you weren't willing to settle

936
00:38:32,468 --> 00:38:34,236
was Harvey's disbarment.
That's gone.

937
00:38:34,303 --> 00:38:36,404
And I want to know
how you made it go away.

938
00:38:36,472 --> 00:38:38,707
- I found dirt on Tanner.
- What dirt?

939
00:38:38,774 --> 00:38:40,775
You blackmailed him
into a settlement.

940
00:38:40,843 --> 00:38:43,011
I leveraged a deal
that's good for the firm.

941
00:38:43,079 --> 00:38:44,679
I said, "what dirt?"

942
00:38:44,747 --> 00:38:46,281
Not your concern.

943
00:38:46,349 --> 00:38:47,749
It's my concern.

944
00:38:47,817 --> 00:38:49,751
I don't want what you did
biting me in the ass.

945
00:38:49,819 --> 00:38:51,586
You were already bitten.

946
00:38:51,654 --> 00:38:54,155
And the last time I crossed the
line and you found out about it,

947
00:38:54,223 --> 00:38:56,124
it bit me in the ass.

948
00:38:56,192 --> 00:38:58,193
You cleared Harvey's name
inside the firm.

949
00:38:58,261 --> 00:39:00,528
We both know
that's what you wanted.

950
00:39:04,967 --> 00:39:07,769
Time to move on.

951
00:39:09,605 --> 00:39:12,540
Let's let the partners
put this to a vote.

952
00:39:22,919 --> 00:39:25,320
Hardman got Tanner to settle.

953
00:39:25,388 --> 00:39:27,856
Are you kidding?

954
00:39:27,924 --> 00:39:29,758
It worked?

955
00:39:29,825 --> 00:39:31,960
So it was your idea
to use dirt to get a deal.

956
00:39:32,028 --> 00:39:35,664
No, it was my idea to use
Tanner against Tanner.

957
00:39:35,731 --> 00:39:37,399
Box.

958
00:39:37,466 --> 00:39:39,034
Me.

959
00:39:41,037 --> 00:39:42,370
You're welcome.
I didn't thank you.

960
00:39:42,438 --> 00:39:44,039
It's okay. You don't have to.

961
00:39:44,106 --> 00:39:45,206
And I'm not going to,

962
00:39:45,274 --> 00:39:46,942
'cause we're not
taking the deal.

963
00:39:52,315 --> 00:39:54,149
Because you don't trust Daniel.

964
00:39:54,216 --> 00:39:55,617
This isn't just about me.

965
00:39:55,685 --> 00:39:58,954
Every partner is...
everybody is paying now.

966
00:40:00,723 --> 00:40:05,060
Do you have any idea why Donna
showed up to testify?

967
00:40:05,127 --> 00:40:07,629
Because I convinced her to.
What?

968
00:40:07,697 --> 00:40:09,064
Yeah, I made her do
what I needed

969
00:40:09,131 --> 00:40:10,332
instead of what she wanted.

970
00:40:10,399 --> 00:40:12,067
I did what you do.

971
00:40:12,134 --> 00:40:13,601
And look where that's gotten us,
you, me,

972
00:40:13,669 --> 00:40:16,438
Jessica, Louis, everybody.

973
00:40:16,505 --> 00:40:18,106
Take the deal, Harvey.

974
00:40:18,174 --> 00:40:20,141
What did Hardman find
in those files?

975
00:40:20,209 --> 00:40:21,609
I don't know, and I don't care,

976
00:40:21,677 --> 00:40:24,279
because he just got every single
one of us off the hook.

977
00:40:24,347 --> 00:40:25,947
He can't be trusted,
and you should know that by now.

978
00:40:26,015 --> 00:40:29,150
No, what I know is that if you
take this thing to trial,

979
00:40:29,218 --> 00:40:33,421
it's gonna cost us all a hell
of a lot more than money.

980
00:40:35,257 --> 00:40:39,060
And if you don't know that
by now, after all this,

981
00:40:39,128 --> 00:40:43,631
then I don't think I should be
the one learning from you.

982
00:40:47,737 --> 00:40:49,471
This is your decision.

983
00:40:49,538 --> 00:40:53,641
So, by a show of hands,
those in favor of settling?

984
00:41:02,518 --> 00:41:04,853
Thank you.

985
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:09,991
Now all those in favor
of going to trial.

986
00:41:15,631 --> 00:41:19,034
Split vote.

987
00:41:19,101 --> 00:41:21,970
And it appears
we have a holdout.

988
00:41:27,676 --> 00:41:30,612
I vote we settle.

989
00:41:36,685 --> 00:41:42,424
Let the record show
we have settled.

990
00:41:42,491 --> 00:41:46,394
Thank you for your time.

991
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:47,729
In light of recent events,

992
00:41:47,797 --> 00:41:51,266
there is one other issue
I'd like to raise.

993
00:41:51,333 --> 00:41:54,135
This lawsuit has caused
some of you to question.

994
00:41:54,203 --> 00:41:57,739
Jessica's judgment and,
by extension, her leadership.

995
00:41:57,807 --> 00:42:02,577
Allowing this kind of dissention
to fester hurts the entire firm.

996
00:42:02,645 --> 00:42:06,781
Therefore, I am calling
a partners' meeting,

997
00:42:06,849 --> 00:42:09,417
at which point we will vote:

998
00:42:09,485 --> 00:42:13,822
Either Jessica will retain her
position as managing partner,

999
00:42:13,889 --> 00:42:17,192
or I will resume control
of Pearson Hardman.
