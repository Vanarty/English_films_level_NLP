1
00:00:10,074 --> 00:00:11,739
Donna...

2
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:14,223
Donna.

3
00:00:14,224 --> 00:00:15,557
You know, in all the years
that we worked together,

4
00:00:15,559 --> 00:00:17,225
you've been over
to my place exactly twice,

5
00:00:17,227 --> 00:00:18,660
the God-awful
dinner party and...

6
00:00:18,662 --> 00:00:19,761
the other time.

7
00:00:19,763 --> 00:00:21,029
I have been gone three weeks,

8
00:00:21,031 --> 00:00:23,131
and you've been here
that many times. What?

9
00:00:23,133 --> 00:00:24,733
I had a good time
at that dinner party.

10
00:00:24,735 --> 00:00:26,935
Oh, my God, it is
just like you to make a joke.

11
00:00:26,937 --> 00:00:28,937
And ignore the other time.

12
00:00:31,007 --> 00:00:33,141
I brought you your bonus.

13
00:00:36,779 --> 00:00:38,446
Really? You thought that

14
00:00:38,448 --> 00:00:39,848
would make it all better,
handing me a check?

15
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:41,449
Look, I know that
you're pissed.

16
00:00:41,451 --> 00:00:43,218
- Oh, what gave it away?
- Donna...

17
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:45,787
You just had to jump in there
at the trial, didn't you?

18
00:00:45,789 --> 00:00:47,923
You just had to fight
my battles for me.

19
00:00:47,925 --> 00:00:49,824
Yeah, I did that because,
the last time I saw you,

20
00:00:49,826 --> 00:00:51,660
you were pissed that
I didn't fight for you.

21
00:00:51,662 --> 00:00:53,461
Well, congratulations, Harvey.
All you managed to do

22
00:00:53,463 --> 00:00:56,031
was make it look
like I love you.

23
00:00:56,033 --> 00:00:57,599
Oh, Jesus Christ.

24
00:00:57,601 --> 00:01:00,001
Oh, my God, you think I do.

25
00:01:02,139 --> 00:01:05,507
I have actually never met
such a self-important...

26
00:01:05,509 --> 00:01:07,776
Donna, about that time,
you once told me...

27
00:01:07,778 --> 00:01:09,644
I don't care what
I once told you!

28
00:01:09,646 --> 00:01:10,979
That wasn't
what Louis was asking.

29
00:01:10,981 --> 00:01:12,314
He was asking if I love you.

30
00:01:12,316 --> 00:01:13,782
And you wouldn't answer.

31
00:01:13,784 --> 00:01:15,383
Because he was forcing
a yes or no answer

32
00:01:15,385 --> 00:01:18,453
to a complicated question.

33
00:01:18,455 --> 00:01:21,923
I am not in love
with you, Harvey.

34
00:01:23,059 --> 00:01:25,427
I love you like a brother

35
00:01:25,429 --> 00:01:26,962
or a cousin, somebody that

36
00:01:26,964 --> 00:01:29,297
you really, really look forward
to seeing at Christmas,

37
00:01:29,299 --> 00:01:31,499
and then you're really,
really glad to see leave.

38
00:01:31,501 --> 00:01:33,435
And as far as
you and I are concerned,

39
00:01:33,437 --> 00:01:34,836
Christmas is over.

40
00:01:34,838 --> 00:01:36,471
I didn't just come here
to give you a check.

41
00:01:36,473 --> 00:01:37,939
I came here to get you back.

42
00:01:37,941 --> 00:01:39,307
What, Cameron not working out?

43
00:01:39,309 --> 00:01:41,243
I heard that little shit
redid my entire filing system.

44
00:01:41,245 --> 00:01:43,845
Cameron's fine.
Look, I need you.

45
00:01:43,847 --> 00:01:47,215
- Need?
- Need.

46
00:01:47,217 --> 00:01:48,817
- Well, what about Jessica?
- Already signed off.

47
00:01:48,819 --> 00:01:50,185
How did you get her to do that?

48
00:01:50,187 --> 00:01:54,422
Because I told her
I can't be me without you.

49
00:01:55,925 --> 00:01:58,793
- No, you didn't.
- Well, I thought it.

50
00:01:58,795 --> 00:02:00,562
And she knows it.

51
00:02:00,564 --> 00:02:01,963
Okay, I will come back
on two conditions.

52
00:02:01,965 --> 00:02:05,800
One is you replace that check
with a bigger one.

53
00:02:05,802 --> 00:02:08,903
And the other?

54
00:02:15,378 --> 00:02:16,845
Harold...

55
00:02:16,847 --> 00:02:20,348
Is that porn? No.

56
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:22,717
Well, yes, but that's not
what I'm using it for.

57
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:24,286
Okay, I'm about 150% sure

58
00:02:24,288 --> 00:02:27,155
that I'm gonna
regret this, but...

59
00:02:27,157 --> 00:02:28,189
What are you using it for?

60
00:02:28,191 --> 00:02:30,025
I'm looking at tattoos.

61
00:02:30,027 --> 00:02:31,926
I told you, it's what
I'm getting with my first...

62
00:02:31,928 --> 00:02:34,863
Bonus time, boys and girls.

63
00:02:34,865 --> 00:02:37,866
Too much. <i>Way</i> too much.

64
00:02:37,868 --> 00:02:42,103
Oof, multiply this by zero,
and it's still way too much.

65
00:02:42,105 --> 00:02:44,272
O'Neil, Racine,

66
00:02:44,274 --> 00:02:47,342
Sabbatini... no Ross.

67
00:02:47,344 --> 00:02:49,044
- Very funny, Louis.
- I'm not kidding.

68
00:02:49,046 --> 00:02:51,546
It looks like
you came up empty.

69
00:02:58,187 --> 00:03:00,188
You have the file for
the Solis motion to dismiss?

70
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:02,857
Yep, all set.
Main citations are tabbed.

71
00:03:02,859 --> 00:03:06,361
Good. Go. I'm busy.

72
00:03:06,363 --> 00:03:08,763
Okay, I was just, um...

73
00:03:08,765 --> 00:03:11,299
you know, before, um... you...

74
00:03:11,301 --> 00:03:13,668
Are you having a stroke?

75
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:15,203
What? My bonus.

76
00:03:15,205 --> 00:03:16,771
Louis didn't have it.

77
00:03:16,773 --> 00:03:18,640
Well, at least, he said
that he didn't have it,

78
00:03:18,642 --> 00:03:20,241
so I thought
that maybe you, uh...

79
00:03:20,243 --> 00:03:22,377
Maybe Jessica thinks
you don't deserve one.

80
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:25,046
You know, because...
you're not a lawyer.

81
00:03:25,048 --> 00:03:28,416
Right, right.
No, that's true, so I guess

82
00:03:28,418 --> 00:03:29,918
these won't be
doing you any good.

83
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,186
Jessica thinks
you're not a lawyer.

84
00:03:31,188 --> 00:03:33,188
I don't think that.

85
00:03:37,593 --> 00:03:41,162
Um... wow.

86
00:03:41,164 --> 00:03:43,631
Your Monica Eton
performance worked.

87
00:03:43,633 --> 00:03:47,001
You switched Carson,
Gallo, and Fogerty.

88
00:03:47,003 --> 00:03:48,336
Wait, is that why
you're giving me so much?

89
00:03:48,338 --> 00:03:50,171
Yes. We're up one.

90
00:03:50,173 --> 00:03:51,606
You might want to
hold onto it for a bit.

91
00:03:51,608 --> 00:03:53,007
- Why?
- Hanson.

92
00:03:53,009 --> 00:03:54,109
Took a job at
the Justice Department.

93
00:03:54,111 --> 00:03:57,178
Our lead is gone.
Now we're even.

94
00:03:59,049 --> 00:04:01,182
Well, the vote's in four days.

95
00:04:01,184 --> 00:04:04,152
The tie goes to the incumbent.
So we're good.

96
00:04:04,154 --> 00:04:08,089
- Probably.
- Nice.

97
00:04:08,091 --> 00:04:10,358
Uh, you do realize that
"hold onto it for a bit" thing,

98
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,527
that's just a figure of speech.

99
00:04:12,529 --> 00:04:16,664
Yeah, okay, I'm just...

100
00:04:24,508 --> 00:04:25,974
You wanted to see me?

101
00:04:25,976 --> 00:04:29,210
Saw you handing out bonuses
to the associates earlier.

102
00:04:29,212 --> 00:04:31,813
They must all
be feeling grateful.

103
00:04:31,815 --> 00:04:33,648
The firm was quite generous.

104
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:36,451
It's not just the associates
who should be rewarded.

105
00:04:36,453 --> 00:04:37,719
Well, for me personally,
it's the satisfaction

106
00:04:37,721 --> 00:04:39,487
of the work that drives me.

107
00:04:39,489 --> 00:04:42,457
Although the money
does help keep score.

108
00:04:42,459 --> 00:04:43,525
You misunderstand me.

109
00:04:43,527 --> 00:04:44,893
I don't have a check
for you, Louis.

110
00:04:44,895 --> 00:04:48,730
I was hoping
you had one for me.

111
00:04:48,732 --> 00:04:49,864
I'm sorry, I'm confused.

112
00:04:49,866 --> 00:04:51,599
Jessica is the one

113
00:04:51,601 --> 00:04:53,701
who handles the bonuses
for the partners.

114
00:04:53,703 --> 00:04:55,703
I'm not talking
about a bonus check.

115
00:04:55,705 --> 00:04:58,640
I'm talking about a buy-in check
for a senior partnership.

116
00:04:58,642 --> 00:05:02,444
As founding partner,
I'm entitled to name

117
00:05:02,446 --> 00:05:06,314
one new senior partner a year.

118
00:05:06,316 --> 00:05:08,516
I'm naming you.

119
00:05:14,924 --> 00:05:18,059
You're making... you're...

120
00:05:18,061 --> 00:05:20,361
- you're making me...
- Yes.

121
00:05:29,138 --> 00:05:31,339
I can't wait to tell everybody.

122
00:05:31,341 --> 00:05:33,575
My mother, my father,
Rabbi Shimkoff...

123
00:05:33,577 --> 00:05:36,644
Yes.

124
00:05:36,646 --> 00:05:40,482
Oh, my God, the look
on Harvey's face!

125
00:05:40,484 --> 00:05:42,383
Louis...

126
00:05:42,385 --> 00:05:44,486
It's official
as of this moment.

127
00:05:44,488 --> 00:05:46,221
But I think we should
make the actual announcement

128
00:05:46,223 --> 00:05:48,423
at the next
senior partners meeting.

129
00:05:48,425 --> 00:05:49,757
Sure, the meeting where

130
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:50,859
the managing partner
will be voted on.

131
00:05:50,861 --> 00:05:53,361
I believe that is
on the agenda.

132
00:05:53,363 --> 00:05:57,599
Best to do these things
face to face, don't you agree?

133
00:05:57,601 --> 00:06:00,835
It's our secret.

134
00:06:00,837 --> 00:06:02,537
Tomorrow's just like
any other Tuesday.

135
00:06:02,539 --> 00:06:04,506
Exactly.

136
00:06:04,508 --> 00:06:09,077

Get out.

147
00:07:32,113 --> 00:07:33,613
And take your color-coded
filing system with you.

148
00:07:33,615 --> 00:07:35,315
It's a system. How do I...

149
00:07:35,317 --> 00:07:38,151
I'm trying to give the moment
some dramatic flair.

150
00:07:38,153 --> 00:07:40,053
Jeez, now he ruined that too.

151
00:07:40,055 --> 00:07:43,222
God.

152
00:07:43,224 --> 00:07:44,424
That's it?

153
00:07:44,426 --> 00:07:46,326
That was worth making
a whole condition?

154
00:07:46,328 --> 00:07:47,860
I've never fired anyone before.

155
00:07:47,862 --> 00:07:49,462
You know he's
a floating temp, right?

156
00:07:49,464 --> 00:07:53,032
I mean, he'll be on somebody
else's desk by the end of lunch.

157
00:07:53,034 --> 00:07:56,736
Does everyone
have to rain on my parade?

158
00:08:06,314 --> 00:08:07,647
First of all, you just
have to look at the statistics.

159
00:08:07,649 --> 00:08:09,649
I mean, this guy Solis
could barely crack

160
00:08:09,651 --> 00:08:11,718
20 homers a season
a few years ago.

161
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:14,153
And now he's banging out
over 40 a year?

162
00:08:14,155 --> 00:08:17,090
What's that supposed to be,
the wisdom of age?

163
00:08:17,092 --> 00:08:18,491
And you don't even
have to look at

164
00:08:18,493 --> 00:08:19,559
what he's doing on the field

165
00:08:19,561 --> 00:08:20,693
to wonder if
this guy is juicing.

166
00:08:20,695 --> 00:08:23,329
Just take a look at him.

167
00:08:23,331 --> 00:08:24,864
Now, look, I might not
be a scientist,

168
00:08:24,866 --> 00:08:27,500
but I do have common sense,

169
00:08:27,502 --> 00:08:30,103
and it says this guy is doping.

170
00:08:30,105 --> 00:08:35,341
But hey, that's just
<i>one man's opinion.</i>

171
00:08:35,343 --> 00:08:36,542
Your Honor,

172
00:08:36,544 --> 00:08:39,812
if being an asshole
was a criminal offense,

173
00:08:39,814 --> 00:08:41,948
I'd say lock Mr. Zielinski up.

174
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:44,384
In fact, if they want
to call him that, be my guest.

175
00:08:44,386 --> 00:08:48,054
But they better use the word
"opinion," like he did,

176
00:08:48,056 --> 00:08:51,024
because unless I woke up
this morning in Nazi Germany,

177
00:08:51,026 --> 00:08:52,792
that's my client's right.

178
00:08:52,794 --> 00:08:55,228
- Nazi Germany?
- Making a point.

179
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:56,596
<i>Ja, gut</i> one.

180
00:08:56,598 --> 00:08:57,997
Your Honor, his client
blatantly declares

181
00:08:57,999 --> 00:09:01,334
his rants are
merely his opinions

182
00:09:01,336 --> 00:09:04,037
for the sole purpose
of skirting libel law.

183
00:09:04,039 --> 00:09:05,938
I drive 65 for the sole purpose

184
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:07,206
of avoiding a speeding ticket.

185
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:08,741
Doesn't make me a criminal.

186
00:09:08,743 --> 00:09:11,411
But Mr. Specter doesn't have
malice against other drivers.

187
00:09:11,413 --> 00:09:13,746
- What does he have?
- I don't know.

188
00:09:13,748 --> 00:09:14,747
Your Honor, we have
a little recording

189
00:09:14,749 --> 00:09:17,016
of Mr. Zielinski of our own.

190
00:09:17,018 --> 00:09:19,218
This is what Mr. Zielinski
sounds like

191
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:21,220
when he doesn't know
the cameras are rolling.

192
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:25,892
Solis? The guy is
a goddamn fraud.

193
00:09:25,894 --> 00:09:27,393
He's juicing, I know it.

194
00:09:27,395 --> 00:09:30,296
I don't care what evidence
he or the league claim to have.

195
00:09:30,298 --> 00:09:32,365
When I say things,
people listen,

196
00:09:32,367 --> 00:09:34,834
and I'm gonna run his ass
out of the game.

197
00:09:34,836 --> 00:09:37,904
- Your Honor...
- Save it, Mr. Specter.

198
00:09:37,906 --> 00:09:40,940
Case goes to trial.

199
00:09:43,877 --> 00:09:45,578
You really only drive 65?

200
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:47,013
In a school zone.

201
00:09:47,015 --> 00:09:48,614
Solis doesn't need the money.
What do you want?

202
00:09:48,616 --> 00:09:51,250
Three years' worth
of random tests by the league

203
00:09:51,252 --> 00:09:53,753
plus independent tests
we had run to quash the rumors.

204
00:09:53,755 --> 00:09:56,522
As you can see,
my client is clean.

205
00:09:56,524 --> 00:09:59,125
- Zielinski doesn't have these.
- Oh, he does, and I know it

206
00:09:59,127 --> 00:10:00,760
because we sent them to him.

207
00:10:00,762 --> 00:10:03,362
But he chooses not
to reveal them on his show.

208
00:10:03,364 --> 00:10:05,031
What if I get him
to air these results

209
00:10:05,033 --> 00:10:06,132
plus your side of the story?

210
00:10:06,134 --> 00:10:08,334
Too late for that.

211
00:10:08,336 --> 00:10:09,936
We want an apology
from your client.

212
00:10:09,938 --> 00:10:11,270
In person?

213
00:10:11,272 --> 00:10:13,005
Nice try.

214
00:10:13,007 --> 00:10:15,074
We want an on-air
complete retraction,

215
00:10:15,076 --> 00:10:18,077
and that's non-negotiable.

216
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:28,287
Louis.

217
00:10:28,289 --> 00:10:29,455
Hi, Donna.

218
00:10:29,457 --> 00:10:31,524
I heard you were back. I am.

219
00:10:31,526 --> 00:10:34,627
Yeah, see that.

220
00:10:34,629 --> 00:10:36,095
Look, you know, I, um...

221
00:10:36,097 --> 00:10:37,797
I never... I never wanted to...

222
00:10:37,799 --> 00:10:40,800
To... what?

223
00:10:40,802 --> 00:10:44,036
I never wanted
to do what I did.

224
00:10:44,038 --> 00:10:48,007
And I-I just
don't have the words...

225
00:10:48,009 --> 00:10:50,710
Find them.

226
00:10:53,413 --> 00:10:57,583
I'm sorry.

227
00:10:57,585 --> 00:11:01,587
I'm so, <i>so</i> sorry.

228
00:11:06,493 --> 00:11:08,494
Then let us never
speak of it again.

229
00:11:11,198 --> 00:11:12,732
Mm... you're kidding, right?

230
00:11:12,734 --> 00:11:14,133
Did you mean
what you just said?

231
00:11:14,135 --> 00:11:16,335
- Pfft, and more.
- Then it's done.

232
00:11:16,337 --> 00:11:18,704
- No, it isn't.
- Did you hear what I just...

233
00:11:18,706 --> 00:11:23,543
Season pass, Lincoln Center,
front row every show.

234
00:11:23,545 --> 00:11:24,710
- Really?
- Yeah.

235
00:11:24,712 --> 00:11:26,546
- Do I have to go with you?
- Hell no.

236
00:11:26,548 --> 00:11:30,550
- Thank you, Louis.
- You are welcome.

237
00:11:30,552 --> 00:11:32,218
God, could this day
get any better?

238
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:33,619
"Any better"?

239
00:11:33,621 --> 00:11:34,720
What was so good
about it before?

240
00:11:34,722 --> 00:11:36,155
- Huh, what happened?
- Something.

241
00:11:36,157 --> 00:11:38,291
Nothing, no, can't I
just be glad you're back?

242
00:11:38,293 --> 00:11:40,660
You look like
you have 80 teeth.

243
00:11:40,662 --> 00:11:43,896
What kind of suit is that?
Brioni. Why?

244
00:11:43,898 --> 00:11:46,332
Oh, shit.

245
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:51,938
Welcome back, Donna.

246
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:53,573
Thank you, but there's
something I need to tell you.

247
00:11:53,575 --> 00:11:56,142
- No need to apologize.
- Uh, that's not what it is.

248
00:11:56,144 --> 00:11:57,343
You're not getting a raise.

249
00:11:57,345 --> 00:12:01,080
Daniel just made Louis
senior partner.

250
00:12:01,082 --> 00:12:02,682
How do you know?

251
00:12:02,684 --> 00:12:04,784
Four years ago, Norma told me
that Louis had a suit

252
00:12:04,786 --> 00:12:07,320
picked out for the day
he made senior partner.

253
00:12:07,322 --> 00:12:09,455
He is wearing it.
Son of a bitch.

254
00:12:09,457 --> 00:12:10,723
Hardman bought another vote.

255
00:12:10,725 --> 00:12:11,724
What are you gonna do about it?

256
00:12:11,726 --> 00:12:14,393
Get it back.

257
00:12:14,395 --> 00:12:16,028
Donna... Yes?

258
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:17,163
How'd the suit look?

259
00:12:17,165 --> 00:12:19,332
Dated.

260
00:12:19,334 --> 00:12:21,167
Thank you.

261
00:12:21,169 --> 00:12:23,169
Can't believe that asshole
put us in this pickle.

262
00:12:23,171 --> 00:12:24,337
I'd think you'd admire him.

263
00:12:24,339 --> 00:12:25,738
He's cleaning up
the game you love.

264
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:29,041
He's been throwing accusations
around with no proof,

265
00:12:29,043 --> 00:12:30,676
and I've had about
enough of that lately.

266
00:12:30,678 --> 00:12:32,445
Well, proof or no proof,
anybody can see

267
00:12:32,447 --> 00:12:33,679
that Solis is juicing.

268
00:12:33,681 --> 00:12:35,381
That's not
what those tests say.

269
00:12:35,383 --> 00:12:37,817
People can find ways
to pass tests, trust me.

270
00:12:37,819 --> 00:12:40,620
Michael!

271
00:12:40,622 --> 00:12:44,624
Grammy? Rachel. Oh, no.

272
00:12:44,626 --> 00:12:45,725
Um, Harvey...

273
00:12:45,727 --> 00:12:47,293
This is
your famous grandmother?

274
00:12:47,295 --> 00:12:49,161
Oh, you were right.
He is sharp.

275
00:12:49,163 --> 00:12:51,797
What are you doing here?

276
00:12:51,799 --> 00:12:54,333
Mr. Specter,
pleasure to meet you.

277
00:12:54,335 --> 00:12:56,535
Your grandson says
nice things about you.

278
00:12:56,537 --> 00:12:59,405
Oh, he tells me
you're quite the hardass.

279
00:12:59,407 --> 00:13:01,641
<i>Can</i> be a hardass.

280
00:13:01,643 --> 00:13:03,309
"Hardass" isn't
really the word he uses.

281
00:13:03,311 --> 00:13:06,279
Okay, grammy,
I see lip runs in the family.

282
00:13:06,281 --> 00:13:08,848
It's nice meeting you.

283
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:11,918
Yeah, um...
what are you doing here?

284
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,153
And... and... and why
are you in Rachel's office?

285
00:13:14,155 --> 00:13:15,354
Oh, we bumped into each other
downstairs in the lobby.

286
00:13:15,356 --> 00:13:17,256
I thought we could eat.

287
00:13:17,258 --> 00:13:20,660
Might as well have brought it
to me in <i>Star Wars</i> lunchbox.

288
00:13:20,662 --> 00:13:23,029
Don't give me lip, Michael.
It's been two months.

289
00:13:23,031 --> 00:13:25,698
I thought maybe you'd want
to see I'm still alive.

290
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:28,434
She's got a point,<i>Michael.</i>

291
00:13:28,436 --> 00:13:31,671
Plus I wanted to meet
the people you work with.

292
00:13:31,673 --> 00:13:33,272
Like Rachel.

293
00:13:33,274 --> 00:13:35,207
She's even more lovely
than you said.

294
00:13:35,209 --> 00:13:37,043
- "Lovely"?
- Okay, we're done here.

295
00:13:37,045 --> 00:13:38,477
Bye, dear.

296
00:13:38,479 --> 00:13:40,246
I hope to see you again soon.
Me too.

297
00:13:40,248 --> 00:13:42,348
It was lovely to meet you.

298
00:13:44,351 --> 00:13:45,584
Okay, did you really

299
00:13:45,586 --> 00:13:47,553
have to tell Rachel
that I said she was hot?

300
00:13:47,555 --> 00:13:52,258
Oh, fine, just let me meet
that Harold clown, and I'll go.

301
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:01,834
You planned this whole thing
from the beginning, didn't you?

302
00:14:01,836 --> 00:14:03,235
I don't know what
you're talking about.

303
00:14:03,237 --> 00:14:05,104
You got Hanson
that job at justice.

304
00:14:05,106 --> 00:14:06,272
It was a loss for us,

305
00:14:06,274 --> 00:14:08,474
but a gain for justice,
don't you think?

306
00:14:08,476 --> 00:14:11,277
And making Louis Litt
a senior partner behind my back.

307
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:14,280
Is that all part
of the new Daniel Hardman

308
00:14:14,282 --> 00:14:16,248
era of transparency?

309
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:17,483
It's within my rights

310
00:14:17,485 --> 00:14:19,719
according to
the bylaws you wrote.

311
00:14:19,721 --> 00:14:25,091
Ah, yes, and how much
did buying his vote cost you?

312
00:14:25,093 --> 00:14:26,292
Cost me?

313
00:14:26,294 --> 00:14:29,862
It was earned years ago.

314
00:14:29,864 --> 00:14:33,165
And your failure to promote him
is a perfect example

315
00:14:33,167 --> 00:14:35,634
of how your judgment
has harmed this firm.

316
00:14:35,636 --> 00:14:38,571
My judgment and my discretion

317
00:14:38,573 --> 00:14:40,639
are the only reasons
your ass didn't end up

318
00:14:40,641 --> 00:14:41,974
in jail five years ago.

319
00:14:41,976 --> 00:14:44,110
It wasn't discretion,
it was self-interest.

320
00:14:44,112 --> 00:14:46,212
You ousted me and got the firm.

321
00:14:46,214 --> 00:14:50,950
- I saved you and got the firm.
- You did.

322
00:14:50,952 --> 00:14:53,219
But you didn't steal the ball
from me five years ago.

323
00:14:53,221 --> 00:14:55,021
I dropped it.

324
00:14:55,023 --> 00:14:58,791
My lieutenant was all
you were ever meant to be.

325
00:15:00,427 --> 00:15:03,195
I'm going to offer you a deal.

326
00:15:03,197 --> 00:15:05,765
Take Porter, Feldman,
Gallagher...

327
00:15:05,767 --> 00:15:08,834
I'll let you walk away,
set up shop wherever you like.

328
00:15:08,836 --> 00:15:11,704
I'll waive the non-compete.

329
00:15:11,706 --> 00:15:13,105
You don't have the votes.

330
00:15:13,107 --> 00:15:14,774
I put you out once.

331
00:15:14,776 --> 00:15:16,575
When I beat you this time,

332
00:15:16,577 --> 00:15:18,444
they're gonna have
to peel you off the wall.

333
00:15:18,446 --> 00:15:20,613
It's nice to see you

334
00:15:20,615 --> 00:15:22,715
doing your own dirty work
for a change.

335
00:15:22,717 --> 00:15:25,951
Unfortunately, this time,
you can't have Harvey threaten

336
00:15:25,953 --> 00:15:28,487
to tell my dying wife
or my teenage daughter

337
00:15:28,489 --> 00:15:31,257
about my indiscretions.

338
00:15:31,259 --> 00:15:36,162
You didn't even know
about Sarah, did you?

339
00:15:36,164 --> 00:15:37,496
He did what I told him to do.

340
00:15:37,498 --> 00:15:42,735
No. You can't even control
your own attack dog.

341
00:15:42,737 --> 00:15:44,403
Well, get this.

342
00:15:44,405 --> 00:15:47,139
I wasn't even planning on
coming back after Alicia died.

343
00:15:47,141 --> 00:15:49,341
Then you sent him,
and I had no choice.

344
00:15:49,343 --> 00:15:51,010
Bullshit.

345
00:15:51,012 --> 00:15:52,278
You do what you want to do.

346
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:54,780
You always have,
and you always will.

347
00:15:54,782 --> 00:15:59,151
Well, water under the bridge.

348
00:15:59,153 --> 00:16:02,655
We are where we are.

349
00:16:02,657 --> 00:16:04,957
And I like where I am.

350
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:08,994
And we'll see who peels whom
off the wall.

351
00:16:17,342 --> 00:16:18,976
Let me get this straight.

352
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:21,279
You realized that Daniel
was pulling a move,

353
00:16:21,281 --> 00:16:22,647
and you confronted him?

354
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:24,849
How many times have you told me
not to poke the bear?

355
00:16:24,851 --> 00:16:26,217
I didn't just poke.

356
00:16:26,219 --> 00:16:28,185
I made him an offer.
Which he refused.

357
00:16:28,187 --> 00:16:29,920
And now he knows
we're on to Louis.

358
00:16:29,922 --> 00:16:31,822
If I lose this thing
because of Louis Litt...

359
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:33,824
You're not losing.

360
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:35,726
You have a card to play
that Hardman doesn't have.

361
00:16:35,728 --> 00:16:38,029
- No, no.
- Yes.

362
00:16:38,031 --> 00:16:40,064
Partner bonuses
haven't gone out yet.

363
00:16:40,066 --> 00:16:42,166
I'm not using the bonuses
to buy people off.

364
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:44,835
You might be ethically
against playing politics

365
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,704
with our firm's money,
but he isn't.

366
00:16:46,706 --> 00:16:48,205
This isn't about ethics.

367
00:16:48,207 --> 00:16:50,241
If I give Louis
an extra $100,000,

368
00:16:50,243 --> 00:16:53,010
how's that gonna play
with Gallo, Klyman, Reeger?

369
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:55,613
Then do what Daniel did.
Make another senior partner.

370
00:16:55,615 --> 00:16:59,016
We get one each per year.
I named you.

371
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:01,986
Read the bylaws just once.

372
00:17:01,988 --> 00:17:03,954
You've got to be kidding me.

373
00:17:03,956 --> 00:17:06,590
Louis is going to be
the deciding vote.

374
00:17:06,592 --> 00:17:10,761
And he better vote for me.

375
00:17:10,763 --> 00:17:12,730
- No, no!
- Yes.

376
00:17:12,732 --> 00:17:13,964
Harvey, this is
your chance to prove

377
00:17:13,966 --> 00:17:15,800
you learned something
from that mess you made

378
00:17:15,802 --> 00:17:17,935
with Paul Porter.
I have nothing to offer him.

379
00:17:17,937 --> 00:17:20,404
Harvey, you've treated that
man like shit at every turn.

380
00:17:20,406 --> 00:17:22,473
You are the thorn in his side.

381
00:17:22,475 --> 00:17:25,476
It is time that
you pull that thorn out.

382
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,954
Here are your interrogatories.

383
00:17:36,956 --> 00:17:39,190
- Thank you.
- Oh, and remember, Michael,

384
00:17:39,192 --> 00:17:42,226
you have to finish your homework
before you can watch TV.

385
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:43,427
Oh, right, because
my grandmother brought me lunch,

386
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:44,862
that makes me... A little boy.

387
00:17:44,864 --> 00:17:46,497
And this is really fun for you.

388
00:17:46,499 --> 00:17:48,632
It really kind of is.

389
00:17:48,634 --> 00:17:50,634
Are you thinking about moving?

390
00:17:50,636 --> 00:17:53,237
Uh, no, actually I was
looking into getting

391
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:55,673
a place in Manhattan
for my lunch lady.

392
00:17:55,675 --> 00:17:58,509
- You'd really do that for her?
- I am doing it.

393
00:17:58,511 --> 00:18:01,278
It doesn't even come close
to paying her back

394
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:05,049
for everything
she's done for me.

395
00:18:05,051 --> 00:18:07,618
That's, um...

396
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,720
that's really amazing, Mike.

397
00:18:09,722 --> 00:18:10,921
You wanna know what's amazing?

398
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:13,124
- What?
- This place.

399
00:18:13,126 --> 00:18:15,459
Right here, check it out.

400
00:18:15,461 --> 00:18:17,328
It's pretty sweet, right?
Off 10th Avenue.

401
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:18,429
Mmhmm.

402
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:19,663
Does it come
with a bulletproof vest?

403
00:18:19,665 --> 00:18:23,667
Um... okay.

404
00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:24,802
There, how about this one?

405
00:18:24,804 --> 00:18:27,104
- A six floor walk-up.
- Great views.

406
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:30,408
Move over.

407
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:32,143
Okay.

408
00:18:36,148 --> 00:18:38,082
Wait a minute. Yeah?

409
00:18:38,084 --> 00:18:40,317
You set all this up,
so I'd help, didn't you?

410
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:41,786
Oh, I may be a little boy,

411
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:43,721
but I'm not
a stupid little boy.

412
00:18:43,723 --> 00:18:46,290
- You're a sneaky little boy.
- Show me another.

413
00:18:49,728 --> 00:18:53,731
Partner, senior partner...
it all sounds the same to me.

414
00:18:53,733 --> 00:18:55,900
No, Mom, how many times
do I have to tell you?

415
00:18:55,902 --> 00:18:58,302
Senior partner
<i>is</i> the inner circle.

416
00:18:58,304 --> 00:19:00,938
It just makes you sound
like an old man.

417
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:02,206
Stop it.

418
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:03,774
And what would you know
about it, Dad?

419
00:19:03,776 --> 00:19:05,476
Well, you are losing your hair.

420
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:08,012
- It's the cut.
- It is not the cut.

421
00:19:08,014 --> 00:19:09,380
It's the cut!

422
00:19:09,382 --> 00:19:10,514
And by the way, Dad,
if you're not going to bother

423
00:19:10,516 --> 00:19:11,882
to figure out
where the camera is,

424
00:19:11,884 --> 00:19:13,551
maybe you should
put some freaking pants on.

425
00:19:13,553 --> 00:19:16,520
I know where the camera is.
I'm not ashamed of my body.

426
00:19:16,522 --> 00:19:19,523
If you felt the same way,
maybe there'd be a Mrs. Litt.

427
00:19:19,525 --> 00:19:22,993
Louie, I don't want to die
before I see my grandchildren.

428
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:24,328
Mom, you have
two grandchildren.

429
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:26,664
Esther's children
are not Litts!

430
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:27,865
Is that your mom
and dad on there?

431
00:19:27,867 --> 00:19:29,166
Get out, Harvey, I'm Skyping.

432
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:31,268
Is that Harvey Specter?
Let me speak to him.

433
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:35,206
It is about time
I met your best friend...

434
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:36,407
Was that your mom and dad?

435
00:19:36,409 --> 00:19:40,578
What's up? No.

436
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:42,179
What's this?

437
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:45,349
The address of my tailor.
Donna said you asked for it.

438
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:48,986
And what would
really happen to me

439
00:19:48,988 --> 00:19:50,621
if I show up at that address?

440
00:19:50,623 --> 00:19:53,424
You get a nice suit,
one that you could wear tonight

441
00:19:53,426 --> 00:19:55,025
when I take you out to dinner.

442
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:59,263
Donna.

443
00:19:59,265 --> 00:20:00,464
What's the fun
of being senior partner

444
00:20:00,466 --> 00:20:02,032
if you have
to keep it a secret?

445
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:04,435
And why exactly
should I dine with you?

446
00:20:04,437 --> 00:20:06,403
Because you've been waiting
a long time for this,

447
00:20:06,405 --> 00:20:08,706
and I want to congratulate you.

448
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:11,642
You want to congratulate me
on becoming your peer.

449
00:20:11,644 --> 00:20:12,877
- Yes.
- Say it.

450
00:20:12,879 --> 00:20:14,378
I'm your peer. You're my peer.

451
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,113
- We're exactly the same.
- We're exactly the same.

452
00:20:16,115 --> 00:20:17,314
If two girls saw us
walking down the street,

453
00:20:17,316 --> 00:20:18,449
they'd say, "hey,
those guys are twins."

454
00:20:18,451 --> 00:20:19,984
Identical."
Okay, I'm cancelling.

455
00:20:19,986 --> 00:20:22,386
Okay, no, I'm in. I'm in.

456
00:20:22,388 --> 00:20:23,787
I'm in. What time?

457
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:25,055
7:30.

458
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:26,056
Are you gonna be there at 7:30?

459
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:28,359
Yep.

460
00:20:32,797 --> 00:20:34,765
Donna tells the woman,
"I don't care who you are,

461
00:20:34,767 --> 00:20:36,066
you're not getting
my grapefruit."

462
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:37,635
- Then what did you do?
- What could I do?

463
00:20:37,637 --> 00:20:39,637
I gave her <i>my</i> grapefruit.

464
00:20:39,639 --> 00:20:42,673
Thank you.
This is great, Harvey.

465
00:20:42,675 --> 00:20:44,108
We're like two fingers
on the same hand.

466
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:46,043
As long as I'm the index.

467
00:20:46,045 --> 00:20:47,144
I'm serious,
this is nice, you know?

468
00:20:47,146 --> 00:20:50,281
Colleagues. Equals.

469
00:20:50,283 --> 00:20:51,582
Friends.

470
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:54,485
Well, as a friend,

471
00:20:54,487 --> 00:20:55,786
I want you to see something.

472
00:20:55,788 --> 00:20:59,123
What do you got?

473
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:00,991
Five years ago,
I asked you for help

474
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:02,226
to look
into another firm's books.

475
00:21:02,228 --> 00:21:04,862
Well, they were our books.

476
00:21:07,532 --> 00:21:09,733
I helped you prove
Hardman was embezzling.

477
00:21:09,735 --> 00:21:12,036
You also tried
to set up a fall guy.

478
00:21:14,839 --> 00:21:16,440
Me.

479
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:20,177
"A schmuck," I believe, was
the term you used at the time.

480
00:21:20,179 --> 00:21:21,512
This was five years ago,

481
00:21:21,514 --> 00:21:23,080
and you're just getting around
to telling me now?

482
00:21:23,082 --> 00:21:24,315
I wonder why that is.

483
00:21:24,317 --> 00:21:26,483
I didn't see the need
for you to be hurt.

484
00:21:26,485 --> 00:21:28,018
Right, 'cause I'm your friend.

485
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:29,887
A friend tells you the truth,

486
00:21:29,889 --> 00:21:33,023
and the truth is, Hardman
used you to hide his embezzling,

487
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:35,125
and he's using you again.

488
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:36,126
And how exactly
is that different from

489
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,361
what you're doing right now?

490
00:21:37,363 --> 00:21:38,696
You can't trust him.

491
00:21:38,698 --> 00:21:39,763
But I can trust you?

492
00:21:39,765 --> 00:21:42,099
- Yes, you can.
- Oh, please.

493
00:21:42,101 --> 00:21:44,134
Did I tell Jessica about
your little dictaphone maneuver?

494
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:45,836
No, you know what you did?
You lorded it over my head,

495
00:21:45,838 --> 00:21:47,538
said that I'd owe you,
and now you've come to collect.

496
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:48,772
Well, you know what? Go ahead.

497
00:21:48,774 --> 00:21:50,874
Run to mommy. Tattle.

498
00:21:50,876 --> 00:21:52,076
I mean, this was about my vote?

499
00:21:52,078 --> 00:21:53,377
If I do vote for Daniel,

500
00:21:53,379 --> 00:21:55,079
what is Jessica
gonna do about it?

501
00:22:06,042 --> 00:22:07,741
I found this one
that faces away from Lex,

502
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:09,043
so she won't get
all the street noise,

503
00:22:09,045 --> 00:22:10,444
and I checked into the doormen.

504
00:22:10,446 --> 00:22:12,613
Raul's been here 14 years,
and Jimbo 17.

505
00:22:12,615 --> 00:22:14,181
Jimbo?

506
00:22:14,183 --> 00:22:15,783
People open up to me.

507
00:22:15,785 --> 00:22:18,786
So what do you think?

508
00:22:18,788 --> 00:22:21,989
I think...

509
00:22:21,991 --> 00:22:23,490
Grammy's gonna love it
when I tell her

510
00:22:23,492 --> 00:22:26,126
she has a new place
to live tonight.

511
00:22:26,128 --> 00:22:31,432
Come on, you haven't
even seen the bedroom yet.

512
00:22:31,434 --> 00:22:32,800
- Holy shit.
- I know.

513
00:22:32,802 --> 00:22:34,034
It's perfect, right?

514
00:22:34,036 --> 00:22:35,502
All you need are
some new curtains right here.

515
00:22:35,504 --> 00:22:38,205
No, the first thing I would
do is put down a nice rug.

516
00:22:38,207 --> 00:22:39,740
You wanna cover the hardwood?

517
00:22:39,742 --> 00:22:42,576
- Not all of it.
- So you mean an area rug.

518
00:22:42,578 --> 00:22:46,513
No, I mean, cover an area
of the hardwood with a rug.

519
00:22:46,515 --> 00:22:48,182
I can live with that.
Like an 8x10 Sisal.

520
00:22:48,184 --> 00:22:50,918
- A whatsal?
- The beige, scratchy kind.

521
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,319
A scratchy rug defeats

522
00:22:52,321 --> 00:22:53,587
it wasn't my idea
in the first place.

523
00:22:53,589 --> 00:22:54,989
Fair enough, but the bed...

524
00:22:54,991 --> 00:22:56,657
The bed goes here.

525
00:22:56,659 --> 00:22:58,092
Oh, my God, you're such a guy.

526
00:22:58,094 --> 00:23:00,094
If the bed doesn't go here,

527
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:01,862
then what's the point
of even having the window?

528
00:23:01,864 --> 00:23:03,197
Yeah, but your curtains
cover up the light anyway.

529
00:23:03,199 --> 00:23:04,298
No, that would be shades,

530
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:06,767
which this room
will never, ever have.

531
00:23:06,769 --> 00:23:09,069
Look, just come right here.

532
00:23:09,071 --> 00:23:12,640
See what I mean?

533
00:23:14,175 --> 00:23:16,176
Beautiful.

534
00:23:22,117 --> 00:23:24,218
I should go meet Harvey.
It's really hot in here.

535
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:26,220
Yeah.

536
00:23:28,823 --> 00:23:30,324
Nice of you to make it.

537
00:23:30,326 --> 00:23:31,892
Sorry, I had
this thing with Rachel.

538
00:23:31,894 --> 00:23:34,628
Oh, a date. Isn't that special?

539
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:37,331
Not as special
as your date last night.

540
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:38,832
So how is Louis?
What did he wear?

541
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:40,734
Did you get any? Shut me down.

542
00:23:40,736 --> 00:23:42,069
What?

543
00:23:42,071 --> 00:23:43,671
This is serious.
What are we gonna do?

544
00:23:43,673 --> 00:23:45,239
I don't know,
but I'll tell you one thing...

545
00:23:45,241 --> 00:23:47,608
I'm not taking
no for an answer.

546
00:23:47,610 --> 00:23:50,544
No way! You want me
to apologize on the air?

547
00:23:50,546 --> 00:23:52,146
Why don't I just drop my pants

548
00:23:52,148 --> 00:23:54,448
and paint a clown on my ass?
Save that for sweeps.

549
00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:56,283
I have a reputation,
Mr. Specter.

550
00:23:56,285 --> 00:23:57,885
And by the way,
I don't appreciate

551
00:23:57,887 --> 00:23:59,353
you bashing it in court.

552
00:23:59,355 --> 00:24:01,255
Look, I went to court
to win the case,

553
00:24:01,257 --> 00:24:03,123
not protect your reputation.

554
00:24:03,125 --> 00:24:04,692
Yeah, well, turns out
you didn't do either one.

555
00:24:04,694 --> 00:24:07,161
Here's a suggestion.

556
00:24:07,163 --> 00:24:08,595
Next time, make sure
you're actually off the air

557
00:24:08,597 --> 00:24:09,930
before shooting your mouth off.

558
00:24:09,932 --> 00:24:12,466
I stand by what I said.

559
00:24:12,468 --> 00:24:14,201
Solis is doping.

560
00:24:14,203 --> 00:24:16,303
Roger Maris got
an asterisk next to his name.

561
00:24:16,305 --> 00:24:18,972
This guy deserves
an asterisk next to his name,

562
00:24:18,974 --> 00:24:20,841
and I want him
out of the league.

563
00:24:20,843 --> 00:24:22,343
You're not
the commissioner of baseball.

564
00:24:22,345 --> 00:24:24,311
Yeah, well, the commissioner
could never get my ratings.

565
00:24:24,313 --> 00:24:25,879
- Mr. Zielinski...
- See, finally,

566
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:26,914
someone who treats me
with respect.

567
00:24:26,916 --> 00:24:28,182
We can't claim

568
00:24:28,184 --> 00:24:29,450
that you're just
offering up opinions anymore.

569
00:24:29,452 --> 00:24:31,085
If you don't apologize,
we have to show

570
00:24:31,087 --> 00:24:33,654
that you have a factual basis
for accusing Solis of doping.

571
00:24:33,656 --> 00:24:35,622
- Of course I did.
- Then give us your source.

572
00:24:35,624 --> 00:24:36,724
What kind of career
do you think

573
00:24:36,726 --> 00:24:38,058
I'd have if I give that up?

574
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:39,693
I'll tell you what...
nonexistent.

575
00:24:39,695 --> 00:24:40,928
Exactly like your source.

576
00:24:40,930 --> 00:24:42,663
- Harvey, please, could...
- That's it.

577
00:24:42,665 --> 00:24:43,964
Instead of bugging me
to give up my guy

578
00:24:43,966 --> 00:24:45,299
after I already told you no,

579
00:24:45,301 --> 00:24:48,869
why don't you do your damn job
and win this case?

580
00:24:52,073 --> 00:24:55,376
Well, looks like good cop,
bad cop didn't work.

581
00:24:55,378 --> 00:24:58,812
- Actually it did... on me.
- What are you talking about?

582
00:24:58,814 --> 00:25:01,215
If he's full of shit
and has no source,

583
00:25:01,217 --> 00:25:03,917
he knows this eventually
goes against him in court.

584
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:07,287
I think Solis is doping.
Welcome to the party.

585
00:25:07,289 --> 00:25:09,189
And Zielinski may have
some integrity.

586
00:25:09,191 --> 00:25:11,692
I thought you said
he was a dick.

587
00:25:11,694 --> 00:25:13,660
If he's actually
protecting his source,

588
00:25:13,662 --> 00:25:15,429
he's a dick with a code.

589
00:25:15,431 --> 00:25:17,364
His code is our problem.

590
00:25:17,366 --> 00:25:19,566
If we can't find that source,
we can't fix it.

591
00:25:19,568 --> 00:25:20,968
Forget the source.

592
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:23,070
We need to figure out
how Solis passed those tests.

593
00:25:23,072 --> 00:25:24,438
How are we supposed to do that?

594
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,140
Not us, you.

595
00:25:26,142 --> 00:25:28,108
I'm like Zielinski,
you're like Solis.

596
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:30,778
- An all-star.
- A cheater.

597
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:32,179
You're not gonna
tell the bar association

598
00:25:32,181 --> 00:25:34,715
that I deserve
an asterisk, are you?

599
00:25:34,717 --> 00:25:37,084
You just gave me a good idea.

600
00:25:37,086 --> 00:25:39,386
I hope it doesn't involve
you telling the bar association

601
00:25:39,388 --> 00:25:41,388
that I deserve an asterisk.

602
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:49,396
Oh, a bat.

603
00:25:49,398 --> 00:25:51,965
What, are you gonna hit me
if I don't vote for Jessica?

604
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:54,735
No, I just wanted you to hear
a story before you decided.

605
00:25:54,737 --> 00:25:57,171
Ah.

606
00:25:57,173 --> 00:25:58,972
More dirt on Hardman.

607
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:00,307
The story's about Roger Maris.

608
00:26:00,309 --> 00:26:02,009
Yeah, what,
did he work for Hardman?

609
00:26:04,746 --> 00:26:06,780
He used to play
for the Yankees.

610
00:26:06,782 --> 00:26:08,482
He beat Babe Ruth's
home run record

611
00:26:08,484 --> 00:26:10,751
with this bat.
You brought a prop.

612
00:26:10,753 --> 00:26:12,052
That's really cute.

613
00:26:12,054 --> 00:26:13,987
Maris did it
in a longer season,

614
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:16,390
so no one really
gave him credit for it,

615
00:26:16,392 --> 00:26:18,892
and it went down in
people's minds with an asterisk.

616
00:26:18,894 --> 00:26:22,262
I see, so it's a parable.
How literary of you.

617
00:26:22,264 --> 00:26:24,398
Becoming senior partner
is your life's work, Louis.

618
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,999
You really want to buy it
with your vote?

619
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:29,002
Daniel did not condition
my partnership on anything.

620
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:30,437
Maybe, but it'll always
have an asterisk.

621
00:26:30,439 --> 00:26:31,638
You know what?
It's like you just

622
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:34,408
can't fathom that
I actually earned it.

623
00:26:34,410 --> 00:26:36,944
Whether you earned it or not,
that's not the point.

624
00:26:36,946 --> 00:26:38,212
It's everything.

625
00:26:38,214 --> 00:26:40,447
All I am saying is,
you vote for Hardman,

626
00:26:40,449 --> 00:26:42,783
everyone will see this
as quid pro quo.

627
00:26:42,785 --> 00:26:44,184
Yeah, because
you're gonna tell them.

628
00:26:44,186 --> 00:26:45,686
No, I won't tell them.

629
00:26:45,688 --> 00:26:48,188
They'll wonder about it
all on their own,

630
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:49,323
just like you will.

631
00:26:49,325 --> 00:26:52,326
Do me a favor right no..

632
00:26:54,395 --> 00:26:56,063
Take your bat and go.

633
00:26:56,065 --> 00:26:58,065
Go.

634
00:27:00,668 --> 00:27:03,103
Louis...

635
00:27:03,105 --> 00:27:04,505
you were right at dinner.

636
00:27:04,507 --> 00:27:07,574
I was using you,
and I was wrong.

637
00:27:07,576 --> 00:27:09,243
But this decision,

638
00:27:09,245 --> 00:27:12,145
it isn't about me.

639
00:27:12,147 --> 00:27:15,148
You came up under Hardman.
You hated him.

640
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:19,052
You always hated him.

641
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:21,255
Don't let him do this to you.

642
00:27:21,257 --> 00:27:22,756
What's my alternative, Harvey?

643
00:27:22,758 --> 00:27:24,391
Jessica didn't even
have the courtesy

644
00:27:24,393 --> 00:27:26,960
to court my vote herself.

645
00:27:26,962 --> 00:27:30,430
So she sends you.
Well, guess what.

646
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:31,932
You failed.

647
00:27:31,934 --> 00:27:34,434
So go back right now.
You tell her,

648
00:27:34,436 --> 00:27:36,737
Harvey Specter,
the great closer,

649
00:27:36,739 --> 00:27:39,573
couldn't close me.

650
00:28:00,695 --> 00:28:02,529
Aren't you supposed to be off
accepting the award

651
00:28:02,531 --> 00:28:04,031
for world's best grandson?

652
00:28:04,033 --> 00:28:06,600
Uh, I had to cancel.

653
00:28:06,602 --> 00:28:08,802
Weren't you taking her
to dinner

654
00:28:08,804 --> 00:28:10,270
to tell her about the apartment
you bought for her

655
00:28:10,272 --> 00:28:11,638
to make up for the fact that

656
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,673
you don't have time
to take her to dinner anymore?

657
00:28:12,675 --> 00:28:13,840
For your information,

658
00:28:13,842 --> 00:28:17,010
she was happy when
I called to reschedule.

659
00:28:17,012 --> 00:28:18,445
Happy to be stood up.

660
00:28:18,447 --> 00:28:20,347
Happy that I have
a job that fully engages me.

661
00:28:20,349 --> 00:28:23,383
There was a time she was
worried that wouldn't happen.

662
00:28:23,385 --> 00:28:25,852
Despite Harvard Law School?

663
00:28:27,755 --> 00:28:29,523
No, I mean, when I was younger.

664
00:28:29,525 --> 00:28:31,224
She's right that
you're really lucky

665
00:28:31,226 --> 00:28:33,627
you get to do something
that challenges you.

666
00:28:33,629 --> 00:28:35,228
I hope I have that someday.

667
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:37,497
Rachel, I told you,
whenever you want help with...

668
00:28:37,499 --> 00:28:40,867
holy shit, you took the LSAT...

669
00:28:40,869 --> 00:28:42,302
you took the LSATs?

670
00:28:42,304 --> 00:28:44,037
I did.

671
00:28:44,039 --> 00:28:45,872
How did you do?

672
00:28:45,874 --> 00:28:47,841
Um... I don't know.

673
00:28:47,843 --> 00:28:49,376
Rachel, you already
did the hard part.

674
00:28:49,378 --> 00:28:52,212
You took the test.
Opening the envelope is easy.

675
00:28:52,214 --> 00:28:53,480
No, every other time
I've had to open the envelope...

676
00:28:53,482 --> 00:28:55,215
This isn't every other time.

677
00:28:57,019 --> 00:28:58,852
Do you want me to open it?

678
00:28:58,854 --> 00:29:01,421
- No.
- Yes, you do.

679
00:29:01,423 --> 00:29:04,658
Okay, um, if I score below 160,

680
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:07,060
then I just want you
to throw it away.

681
00:29:07,062 --> 00:29:09,529
And don't tell me.
I don't want to know, okay?

682
00:29:09,531 --> 00:29:13,166
- Okay.
- Okay.

683
00:29:16,104 --> 00:29:20,374
- Um... Rachel, I'm...
- Okay.

684
00:29:23,445 --> 00:29:25,445
172.

685
00:29:27,949 --> 00:29:29,583
- 172?
- You got a 172.

686
00:29:29,585 --> 00:29:31,251
- Oh, my... I did?
- Yes.

687
00:29:31,253 --> 00:29:33,186
That's... oh, oh, my God!

688
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:35,889
Oh, my God, don't you ever
do that to me again.

689
00:29:35,891 --> 00:29:38,091
Rachel, you're
gonna be a lawyer.

690
00:29:39,461 --> 00:29:40,727
Look, look at it. Oh, my God.

691
00:29:40,729 --> 00:29:42,396
Go.

692
00:29:42,398 --> 00:29:45,766
Bam. Oh, my God.

693
00:29:45,768 --> 00:29:47,100
I'm gonna be out of a job.

694
00:29:53,196 --> 00:29:54,562
Harvey, I think
I found something.

695
00:29:54,564 --> 00:29:56,197
And by "something,"
I assume you mean

696
00:29:56,199 --> 00:29:58,666
how Solis was cheating.
Um, maybe,

697
00:29:58,668 --> 00:30:00,868
but I definitely figured out
who Zielinski's source is.

698
00:30:00,870 --> 00:30:02,136
Well, that counts as something.

699
00:30:02,138 --> 00:30:03,437
They used a hot mic,
I used a hot mic.

700
00:30:03,439 --> 00:30:04,572
What are you talking about?

701
00:30:04,574 --> 00:30:05,940
I found some footage
from a segment

702
00:30:05,942 --> 00:30:07,775
that Zielinski taped
at spring training.

703
00:30:07,777 --> 00:30:10,077
Uh, the crew is setting up,
he's in the background,

704
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:11,279
having a very
intense conversation

705
00:30:11,281 --> 00:30:13,848
with Ruben Hernandez.

706
00:30:13,850 --> 00:30:17,418
Mediocre catcher. So?
Zielinski's a sportscaster.

707
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:19,420
Talking to athletes
is what he does all day.

708
00:30:19,422 --> 00:30:22,290
This conversation
took place in Winter Park.

709
00:30:22,292 --> 00:30:24,325
Hernandez should have been
practicing with his team in...

710
00:30:24,327 --> 00:30:25,393
St. Pete.

711
00:30:25,395 --> 00:30:26,494
He never should have
been there.

712
00:30:26,496 --> 00:30:27,695
Then I remembered the roster of

713
00:30:27,697 --> 00:30:29,363
every single team
Solis ever played on.

714
00:30:29,365 --> 00:30:31,165
- They never played together.
- Wrong, they did.

715
00:30:31,167 --> 00:30:34,602
Ten games, three years ago,
Hernandez's rookie year.

716
00:30:34,604 --> 00:30:36,671
So he got Hernandez
to take the test for him.

717
00:30:36,673 --> 00:30:37,838
Or at least approached him

718
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,974
because Zielinski's accusations
began

719
00:30:39,976 --> 00:30:41,776
one week after
that tape that I watched.

720
00:30:41,778 --> 00:30:43,144
Enough time for Zielinski

721
00:30:43,146 --> 00:30:44,879
to look into
whatever Hernandez told him.

722
00:30:44,881 --> 00:30:47,982
And call him six times from
a company-issued cell phone.

723
00:30:47,984 --> 00:30:49,984
Boom!

724
00:30:49,986 --> 00:30:52,687
Look at you! Hot mic,
using their tricks against them.

725
00:30:52,689 --> 00:30:54,121
Yeah, it's what we do,
no big deal.

726
00:30:54,123 --> 00:30:55,723
Remind me to stop
teaching you my tricks.

727
00:30:55,725 --> 00:30:57,024
Well, you're gonna need
one of your tricks

728
00:30:57,026 --> 00:30:58,893
because what good does
Zielinski's source do us

729
00:30:58,895 --> 00:31:00,294
if he's not going
to let us go public?

730
00:31:00,296 --> 00:31:01,963
Who says we have to go public?

731
00:31:01,965 --> 00:31:03,965
Here's what I need you to do.

732
00:31:05,801 --> 00:31:09,704
I couldn't close him.

733
00:31:09,706 --> 00:31:10,938
Are you trying to tell me

734
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:13,174
you couldn't be nice
to Louis even for this?

735
00:31:13,176 --> 00:31:15,076
No, I'm not.

736
00:31:15,078 --> 00:31:17,211
You said
I'm a thorn in his side.

737
00:31:17,213 --> 00:31:19,246
I tried to take it out,
but you're the one

738
00:31:19,248 --> 00:31:20,848
who's had what he's
wanted all these years

739
00:31:20,850 --> 00:31:23,484
and didn't give it to him.
Senior partnership.

740
00:31:23,486 --> 00:31:25,119
You need to tell him
he deserves it.

741
00:31:25,121 --> 00:31:26,420
That's what I sent you to do.

742
00:31:26,422 --> 00:31:29,757
He needs to hear it from you.

743
00:31:29,759 --> 00:31:32,259
You know, I send you to do
this one thing and you can't...

744
00:31:34,097 --> 00:31:36,230
Fine, I'll talk to him.

745
00:31:36,232 --> 00:31:37,531
Wait a minute.

746
00:31:37,533 --> 00:31:40,901
You know him. You knew this.

747
00:31:40,903 --> 00:31:43,270
This is where
it always ended up.

748
00:31:44,873 --> 00:31:47,074
- You got me.
- Why send me first?

749
00:31:47,076 --> 00:31:49,677
Because if Louis didn't have
to work to get me there,

750
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:51,579
he wouldn't believe me
when I went.

751
00:31:51,581 --> 00:31:53,080
You're playing chess

752
00:31:53,082 --> 00:31:54,648
while everybody else
is playing checkers.

753
00:31:54,650 --> 00:31:56,484
Are you just getting that,

754
00:31:56,486 --> 00:31:59,120
Mr. I'm-the-best-closer-
this-city's-ever-seen?

755
00:31:59,122 --> 00:32:01,222
Hey, you're the one
who always calls me that.

756
00:32:01,224 --> 00:32:03,057
Well, maybe I shouldn't.

757
00:32:03,059 --> 00:32:04,859
Now if you'll excuse me,

758
00:32:04,861 --> 00:32:07,161
I have to tell Louis he deserves
to be senior partner.

759
00:32:07,163 --> 00:32:10,331
You know what, I <i>am</i> the best
closer this city's ever seen,

760
00:32:10,333 --> 00:32:12,700
and I didn't even make a dent.
Do you have a point?

761
00:32:12,702 --> 00:32:14,635
He needs more than just words.

762
00:32:14,637 --> 00:32:15,870
I told you,
I'm not bribing him.

763
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:17,905
That's not what I meant.

764
00:32:17,907 --> 00:32:20,608
His anger is deep.

765
00:32:20,610 --> 00:32:23,444
He wants us to feel pain. How?

766
00:32:25,514 --> 00:32:28,616
Give him my office.

767
00:32:28,618 --> 00:32:30,117
You're willing to do that?

768
00:32:30,119 --> 00:32:31,652
Remember when you questioned

769
00:32:31,654 --> 00:32:34,221
if I could put
your needs above mine?

770
00:32:34,223 --> 00:32:36,924
Here's your answer.

771
00:32:38,326 --> 00:32:39,660
Mr. Solis, big fan.

772
00:32:39,662 --> 00:32:41,595
Can I get an autograph?
Sure, buddy.

773
00:32:41,597 --> 00:32:44,298
Can you just sign it
"Roberto Solis, steroid user"?

774
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:45,533
What?

775
00:32:45,535 --> 00:32:47,234
I represent Tony Zielinski.

776
00:32:47,236 --> 00:32:48,569
You can't talk to me
without my lawyer.

777
00:32:48,571 --> 00:32:49,770
Ah, you're right, I can't.

778
00:32:49,772 --> 00:32:51,906
You go ahead and turn me in.
When you do,

779
00:32:51,908 --> 00:32:53,574
I'll tell them all
about Zielinski's source

780
00:32:53,576 --> 00:32:56,110
inside your clubhouse.
Bullshit.

781
00:32:56,112 --> 00:32:57,344
Baseball is a brotherhood.

782
00:32:57,346 --> 00:32:59,146
Nobody on my team would
go public against me.

783
00:32:59,148 --> 00:33:03,384
But Ruben Hernandez isn't
on your team anymore.

784
00:33:03,386 --> 00:33:05,553
If Ruben tries ratting out
a former teammate,

785
00:33:05,555 --> 00:33:07,121
no ball club in this league
will forgive him.

786
00:33:07,123 --> 00:33:09,323
He might not have a choice
when we subpoena him.

787
00:33:09,325 --> 00:33:11,025
No, no way.

788
00:33:11,027 --> 00:33:13,527
If Zielinski's giving up Ruben,
he'd have done it already.

789
00:33:13,529 --> 00:33:16,430
He might not, but I will.

790
00:33:16,432 --> 00:33:18,232
You're in a rundown, Roberto.

791
00:33:18,234 --> 00:33:21,102
Drop the suit and announce
your retirement from baseball.

792
00:33:21,104 --> 00:33:23,537
- Are you out of your mind?
- You do it,

793
00:33:23,539 --> 00:33:26,006
Zielinski will never mention
your name on air again.

794
00:33:26,008 --> 00:33:28,109
You don't, Hernandez outs you,

795
00:33:28,111 --> 00:33:31,512
and the whole world
knows who you are.

796
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:40,521
Louis, got a minute?

797
00:33:40,523 --> 00:33:42,556
I'm a little busy, but sure.

798
00:33:42,558 --> 00:33:44,258
I deserve that.

799
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:47,995
A little payback among
senior partners is fair play.

800
00:33:47,997 --> 00:33:49,897
I'm listening.

801
00:33:49,899 --> 00:33:53,667
I'm not going to insult you
by beating around the bush,

802
00:33:53,669 --> 00:33:55,870
so let's talk about
the elephant in the room.

803
00:33:55,872 --> 00:33:57,071
What's it gonna take?

804
00:33:57,073 --> 00:33:59,540
My dedication to this firm
knows no limits.

805
00:33:59,542 --> 00:34:02,176
And what I ask in return...
all I ask in return...

806
00:34:02,178 --> 00:34:03,377
is to be valued,

807
00:34:03,379 --> 00:34:04,445
for someone
to make me believe that

808
00:34:04,447 --> 00:34:05,980
they think that
I'm great at what I do.

809
00:34:05,982 --> 00:34:07,781
Then we're all set

810
00:34:07,783 --> 00:34:09,116
because I've always
felt that way.

811
00:34:09,118 --> 00:34:10,251
That's not the way
you made it seem

812
00:34:10,253 --> 00:34:11,619
to everyone at Harvey's trial.

813
00:34:11,621 --> 00:34:12,853
Louis, we were at trial.

814
00:34:12,855 --> 00:34:14,989
I was trying to make my case,
same as you.

815
00:34:17,092 --> 00:34:20,794
Well, you did a good job.

816
00:34:20,796 --> 00:34:24,865
Because that, Jessica,
I got no trouble believing.

817
00:34:24,867 --> 00:34:27,034
But the Jessica that
kept stringing me along,

818
00:34:27,036 --> 00:34:28,602
telling me, one day,
my time would come...

819
00:34:28,604 --> 00:34:29,970
her, I've come to doubt.

820
00:34:29,972 --> 00:34:32,840
I've always been
straight with you, Louis.

821
00:34:32,842 --> 00:34:35,042
My message has never wavered.

822
00:34:35,044 --> 00:34:36,110
Does that include the message

823
00:34:36,112 --> 00:34:37,178
that you sent to me
through Harvey?

824
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:38,312
Harvey came to you first

825
00:34:38,314 --> 00:34:39,880
because I wanted you to know

826
00:34:39,882 --> 00:34:41,582
that you are valuable
to both of us.

827
00:34:41,584 --> 00:34:44,919
No, there's only an "us"
when you want something from me.

828
00:34:44,921 --> 00:34:47,521
The rest of the time, it's me
on the outside, looking in.

829
00:34:47,523 --> 00:34:49,356
Well, you're
a senior partner now.

830
00:34:49,358 --> 00:34:51,158
You're as on the inside
as it gets.

831
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:52,660
That's right,
thanks to Hardman.

832
00:34:52,662 --> 00:34:53,994
You think he's valuing you.

833
00:34:53,996 --> 00:34:55,963
He's buying you...

834
00:34:55,965 --> 00:34:59,833
with this one thing
at this convenient time.

835
00:34:59,835 --> 00:35:02,903
You don't get it.
Hardman actually sees me.

836
00:35:02,905 --> 00:35:04,772
With you, I'll always
be this mushroom

837
00:35:04,774 --> 00:35:06,340
in the shadow of Harvey's tree.

838
00:35:06,342 --> 00:35:07,775
What are you saying, Louis?

839
00:35:07,777 --> 00:35:10,244
I'm saying it's time
you put Harvey in my shadow.

840
00:35:10,246 --> 00:35:12,613
And how exactly
would you like me to do that?

841
00:35:12,615 --> 00:35:14,281
You know, I don't know.
You figure it out.

842
00:35:14,283 --> 00:35:15,349
Otherwise, maybe
one of these days,

843
00:35:15,351 --> 00:35:16,717
you'll see what it's like to be

844
00:35:16,719 --> 00:35:19,253
in someone's shadow
for a while.

845
00:35:21,022 --> 00:35:24,058
You know what, Louis?

846
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:28,596
Harvey told me that
I should give you his office,

847
00:35:28,598 --> 00:35:31,131
and I came in here
prepared to do just that.

848
00:35:31,133 --> 00:35:33,601
But I don't respond to threats,

849
00:35:33,603 --> 00:35:34,868
and I'm not
going to buy your vote

850
00:35:34,870 --> 00:35:36,237
because that's not who I am.

851
00:35:36,239 --> 00:35:38,239
But know this:

852
00:35:38,241 --> 00:35:40,774
I will win.

853
00:35:40,776 --> 00:35:43,077
And tomorrow, after the vote,

854
00:35:43,079 --> 00:35:44,612
if you are on the wrong side,

855
00:35:44,614 --> 00:35:48,716
there'll be no coming back.

856
00:36:10,373 --> 00:36:11,406
When you stole from this firm,

857
00:36:11,407 --> 00:36:14,208
did you do anything
to cover your tracks?

858
00:36:15,610 --> 00:36:17,411
I should have known
they had this in their pocket.

859
00:36:17,413 --> 00:36:18,846
So you don't deny it.

860
00:36:18,848 --> 00:36:20,581
I wouldn't insult
your intelligence.

861
00:36:20,583 --> 00:36:23,384
I'm sure they came to you
armed with proof,

862
00:36:23,386 --> 00:36:25,152
and you followed the numbers
better than I ever could.

863
00:36:25,154 --> 00:36:27,354
- Why?
- The best I can offer you

864
00:36:27,356 --> 00:36:28,656
is that it wasn't personal.

865
00:36:28,658 --> 00:36:31,592
It was just that, given
your financial expertise,

866
00:36:31,594 --> 00:36:33,694
I thought you
would seem plausible.

867
00:36:33,696 --> 00:36:35,863
"Plausible."

868
00:36:35,865 --> 00:36:37,431
Obviously my plan was that

869
00:36:37,433 --> 00:36:40,100
nobody would notice the money
was missing in the first place.

870
00:36:40,102 --> 00:36:43,604
- So I was plan "B."
- I suppose so, Louis.

871
00:36:43,606 --> 00:36:44,772
I'm sorry. You're sor...

872
00:36:47,243 --> 00:36:50,444
Do you realize you could have
destroyed my entire career?

873
00:36:50,446 --> 00:36:53,781
Maybe even sent me to prison.

874
00:36:53,783 --> 00:36:56,383
And you know what?

875
00:36:56,385 --> 00:36:58,452
I didn't care.

876
00:36:58,454 --> 00:37:00,854
That's the truth.

877
00:37:00,856 --> 00:37:02,856
And you want me
to vote for you?

878
00:37:06,461 --> 00:37:07,628
Did you like me back then?

879
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:09,630
I didn't.

880
00:37:09,632 --> 00:37:12,199
The man I was five years ago
shouldn't be managing partner.

881
00:37:12,201 --> 00:37:14,234
He shouldn't even work here.

882
00:37:14,236 --> 00:37:15,903
But I'm not that man.

883
00:37:15,905 --> 00:37:18,172
If you think otherwise,
don't vote for me.

884
00:37:18,174 --> 00:37:21,241
Right.

885
00:37:21,243 --> 00:37:22,409
And if I don't support you,

886
00:37:22,411 --> 00:37:24,478
what happens
to my senior partnership?

887
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:27,581
Do you think my making
you senior partner

888
00:37:27,583 --> 00:37:31,318
is conditioned
on my having your vote?

889
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:33,754
- Wasn't it?
- Louis, I'm disappointed.

890
00:37:33,756 --> 00:37:38,158
I'm disappointed you think
so little of yourself.

891
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:40,761
I saw the way you dominated
Jessica at Harvey's trial

892
00:37:40,763 --> 00:37:43,230
and lost because of some trick.

893
00:37:43,232 --> 00:37:44,632
You thought I dominated?

894
00:37:44,634 --> 00:37:46,433
I offered you what
I thought you deserved,

895
00:37:46,435 --> 00:37:49,003
no more, no less.

896
00:37:49,005 --> 00:37:50,504
I ask for nothing in return

897
00:37:50,506 --> 00:37:53,807
but that you vote
your conscience.

898
00:37:57,779 --> 00:38:01,215
Louis...

899
00:38:01,217 --> 00:38:04,218
don't doubt yourself.

900
00:38:11,559 --> 00:38:13,093
I've got good news.

901
00:38:13,095 --> 00:38:15,295
Solis has not only
agreed to drop the suit,

902
00:38:15,297 --> 00:38:17,765
but to retire
from the game as well.

903
00:38:17,767 --> 00:38:19,833
Well, maybe you're not
the asshole I thought you were.

904
00:38:19,835 --> 00:38:20,934
I'm not done yet.

905
00:38:20,936 --> 00:38:22,536
In return...

906
00:38:22,538 --> 00:38:25,706
you're never gonna talk
about him again on the air.

907
00:38:25,708 --> 00:38:28,509
So he walks away
with his reputation intact?

908
00:38:28,511 --> 00:38:30,411
- That's the deal.
- No, no, no, no.

909
00:38:30,413 --> 00:38:31,545
You know I'm right,

910
00:38:31,547 --> 00:38:32,813
and you want me
to step off the gas

911
00:38:32,815 --> 00:38:35,149
right when I got him?
Screw that.

912
00:38:35,151 --> 00:38:37,985
You want to know
how I know you're right?

913
00:38:37,987 --> 00:38:39,053
Mike?

914
00:38:39,055 --> 00:38:41,789
I believe you know
Ruben Hernandez.

915
00:38:41,791 --> 00:38:44,358
You promised you wouldn't
tell anyone I was your source.

916
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:45,793
I didn't tell them. I didn't.

917
00:38:45,795 --> 00:38:47,628
- Bullshit!
- Mike, get him out of here.

918
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:50,631
I promise we'll fix this.
Come on.

919
00:38:50,633 --> 00:38:52,766
You son of a bitch, you're
supposed to be on my side.

920
00:38:52,768 --> 00:38:54,368
This is me being on your side.

921
00:38:54,370 --> 00:38:55,936
You make me win this in court,

922
00:38:55,938 --> 00:38:58,172
I'll have to do it
by making Ruben testify.

923
00:38:58,174 --> 00:39:00,607
So the cost of
ruining Solis' reputation

924
00:39:00,609 --> 00:39:02,276
will be that kid's career.

925
00:39:02,278 --> 00:39:05,012
And by the way, everyone will
think the same as he does.

926
00:39:05,014 --> 00:39:06,914
You gave him up
to save your own ass.

927
00:39:06,916 --> 00:39:08,215
- That's a lie.
- Doesn't matter.

928
00:39:08,217 --> 00:39:09,349
They'll think it anyway.

929
00:39:09,351 --> 00:39:11,051
But hey, that's
just one man's opinion.

930
00:39:11,053 --> 00:39:12,820
You want to protect
your source?

931
00:39:12,822 --> 00:39:14,688
Take the deal.

932
00:39:15,990 --> 00:39:17,524
- So?
- He took the deal.

933
00:39:17,526 --> 00:39:19,326
We're done with that asshole.
"Asshole"?

934
00:39:19,328 --> 00:39:21,929
Come on, he's just protecting
the church of baseball.

935
00:39:21,931 --> 00:39:22,963
You going <i>Bull Durham</i> on me?

936
00:39:22,965 --> 00:39:24,431
Oh, yeah, yeah,
I'm Tim Robbins,

937
00:39:24,433 --> 00:39:26,934
the hotshot pitcher
who's destined for the Majors,

938
00:39:26,936 --> 00:39:29,536
and you're that old man
who never really made it there.

939
00:39:29,538 --> 00:39:30,738
You know Robbins wore

940
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:31,972
women's underwear
in that movie, right?

941
00:39:31,974 --> 00:39:33,407
Yeah, after he slept
with Susan Sarandon.

942
00:39:33,409 --> 00:39:34,742
Good one.

943
00:39:34,744 --> 00:39:37,244
But if you ever call
Kevin Costner an old man again,

944
00:39:37,246 --> 00:39:39,113
you won't get another bonus.
Okay.

945
00:39:39,115 --> 00:39:40,848
Whoa, my God, bonus.

946
00:39:40,850 --> 00:39:42,983
Harvey, I'm sorry, I've got
to go see my grandmother.

947
00:39:42,985 --> 00:39:46,386
Fine, go, I wouldn't want her
to think I was a hardass.

948
00:39:49,290 --> 00:39:50,390
Did you get rid
of that libel case?

949
00:39:50,392 --> 00:39:52,826
Score one for free press.

950
00:39:52,828 --> 00:39:54,061
Good to see you back in stride.

951
00:39:54,063 --> 00:39:56,230
When was I ever off?

952
00:39:56,232 --> 00:39:57,598
Jessica, do you have a moment?

953
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:59,700
Of course, Louis.
Harvey, will you give us a sec?

954
00:39:59,702 --> 00:40:00,934
Oh, please, what,
are you kidding?

955
00:40:00,936 --> 00:40:03,837
Not like there's any secrets
between you two.

956
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:08,075
Well, we're listening.

957
00:40:08,077 --> 00:40:10,077
I'm presenting
my partnership buy-in check

958
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:13,781
to you in your current capacity
as managing partner.

959
00:40:13,783 --> 00:40:15,415
"Current."

960
00:40:15,417 --> 00:40:18,051
Oh, is that your cryptic way
of asking about my vote?

961
00:40:19,487 --> 00:40:21,188
You kept me waiting five years.

962
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:24,525
You can wait another 24 hours.

963
00:40:44,813 --> 00:40:47,514
Surprise!

964
00:40:47,516 --> 00:40:49,716
Rachel... hey,
what are you doing here?

965
00:40:49,718 --> 00:40:51,718
Come in.

966
00:40:55,156 --> 00:40:59,426
Mike, someone kept calling
the office for you.

967
00:40:59,428 --> 00:41:01,829
It was the nursing home and...

968
00:41:01,831 --> 00:41:06,099
I guess... I guess that's
the emergency number they had.

969
00:41:06,101 --> 00:41:10,070
Um... what?

970
00:41:10,072 --> 00:41:13,040
It's your grandma.

971
00:41:13,042 --> 00:41:17,477
She passed away.

972
00:41:17,479 --> 00:41:20,647
No. No, she's...

973
00:41:20,649 --> 00:41:23,650
I am so sorry.

974
00:41:27,155 --> 00:41:31,158
But...

975
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:35,596
she didn't even
get to s... to see...

976
00:41:35,598 --> 00:41:36,697
I know.

977
00:41:36,699 --> 00:41:37,965
I-I'm...

978
00:41:37,967 --> 00:41:39,800
I'm so sorry.

979
00:41:43,105 --> 00:41:45,706
Wh...

980
00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:50,510
I'm so sorry.
