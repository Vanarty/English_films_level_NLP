1
00:00:08,341 --> 00:00:09,341
Come on.

2
00:00:10,385 --> 00:00:12,505
- You can put him on the table.
- Okay.

3
00:00:14,055 --> 00:00:15,175
Here we go.

4
00:00:15,974 --> 00:00:18,524
- Yeah.
- Can you take his wrap off?

5
00:00:18,601 --> 00:00:20,271
Hey. Hello.

6
00:00:22,313 --> 00:00:24,023
- Unbutton the sweater?
- Yeah.

7
00:00:26,443 --> 00:00:27,443
Okay.

8
00:00:33,575 --> 00:00:35,695
Who the hell would leave a baby
on a porch?

9
00:00:35,785 --> 00:00:37,155
Someone who's desperate.

10
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:42,292
- Is he gonna be okay?
- Yeah.

11
00:00:43,626 --> 00:00:44,626
Yeah.

12
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:47,381
He's warm. He's hydrated, and...

13
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:49,970
he looks good.

14
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:52,590
But, uh... "he" is actually a "she."

15
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:54,219
Ooh!

16
00:00:55,263 --> 00:00:56,263
I know...

17
00:00:57,515 --> 00:00:58,515
Hi.

18
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:00,556
What's that?

19
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:07,527
"I'm sorry, but she'll be better off
with someone else.

20
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:10,109
Please take care of her
and make sure she knows

21
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:13,275
that I'm doing this...
because I love her."

22
00:01:15,116 --> 00:01:16,826
Do you have Doc's cell number?

23
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:19,290
He's on a house call in Myers Flat.
There's no reception.

24
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:22,920
Well, I need to get a hold of his contact
at Child Protective Services.

25
00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:25,289
- Maybe in his office?
- Right. Okay.

26
00:01:25,376 --> 00:01:27,456
- Here, you want me to have a swing?
- Yeah.

27
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:29,958
Ooh, there you go.

28
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:32,971
- Oh, there you go!
- Thanks.

29
00:01:33,843 --> 00:01:35,643
Uh, we're gonna need diapers and formula.

30
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,390
Okay. On it.

31
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:42,059
We'll text Connie and get you
some diapers and formula, huh?

32
00:01:43,144 --> 00:01:44,194
What you want?

33
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:48,021
What you want, huh?

34
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:49,897
Okay.

35
00:01:49,984 --> 00:01:53,404
Ooh, gotta do something
to take your mind off your tummy, huh?

36
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:56,906
What shall we do?

37
00:01:57,742 --> 00:01:59,412
You want a little song? Huh?

38
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:01,161
Yeah?

Oh, really?

49
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:42,961
'Cause "Ride On"
always put me right to sleep.

50
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:44,578
Who are you?

51
00:02:45,915 --> 00:02:47,575
I'm a nurse that knows her metal.

52
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:50,879
- Clearly.
- Where did that baby come from?

53
00:02:51,462 --> 00:02:54,172
Uh...
She was abandoned on your front porch.

54
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:58,639
She's about three weeks.

55
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,010
Her vitals are good,
but she's a little underweight.

56
00:03:01,097 --> 00:03:02,097
Huh.

57
00:03:03,474 --> 00:03:05,274
We need to call Social Services.

58
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:07,941
Well, they're in Eureka,
they don't open for another hour.

59
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:10,767
Well, there's always
an after-hours number.

60
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:15,282
Since this is my office,
and this baby is my patient,

61
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:18,281
I will decide which course of action
we're gonna follow.

62
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:20,368
No agency calls.

63
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,910
And if you don't agree,
you know where the door is.

64
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:26,205
- Now, please watch the baby.
- Yes, of course.

65
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:28,166
Come here, honey. I know.

66
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:30,285
Shh.

67
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:36,259
At least he didn't threaten to shoot you.

68
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:38,221
Oh, oh, the day is young.

69
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:42,893
Oh, cute baby.

70
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:48,138
No, no, I... I don't want to alert
the authorities. That's why I called you.

71
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:49,058
Um...

72
00:03:49,145 --> 00:03:51,055
Y... Look, I... I do have some ideas.

73
00:03:51,147 --> 00:03:52,227
Yes.

74
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:58,244
Here's all the formula and diapers I had.

75
00:03:58,321 --> 00:03:59,781
Oh, wow, thank you.

76
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:03,620
Oh, bless her heart.

77
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:04,952
She's hungry.

78
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:08,001
We're gonna need some hot water.

79
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:09,671
- Okay, yep. I got it.
- Thanks.

80
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:10,879
Mm-hm!

81
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:14,882
Oh, boy, they said you were a looker,
and they weren't lying.

82
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:17,513
I only said you were mildly attractive.

83
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:18,630
Uh-huh.

84
00:04:18,716 --> 00:04:19,966
Mel, this is Connie.

85
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:21,676
Hi, Connie.

86
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:25,101
- I'm, uh, the new nurse practitioner...
- Oh, honey, everyone knows who you are.

87
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:27,021
Connie owns the general store.

88
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:30,020
And I make it my business
to know everything about everybody.

89
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:32,273
- Yeah, whether they like it or not.
- Oh!

90
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:36,145
You know, she looks a little
like Mimi Simpson around the eyes.

91
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:37,994
Mimi's 72.

92
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:39,741
Mimi has a granddaughter.

93
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,620
Hmm. How long ago was prom?

94
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:45,414
Never mind. I'll give Mimi a shout,

95
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:48,413
and then I'll activate
the Virgin River phone tree.

96
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:49,956
- Oh.
- Don't you worry.

97
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:51,289
We'll find your mother.

98
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:53,208
Thanks, Connie.

99
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:58,172
Well. Uh... What's the phone tree?

100
00:04:58,256 --> 00:05:01,926
Whenever there's a town emergency,
it's Connie's job to let everyone know.

101
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:03,337
Oh.

102
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:05,218
Okay. There you go. There you go.

103
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:07,425
Okay. Here you go.

104
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:10,684
No?

105
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:14,020
Okay.

106
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:16,363
This is not good.

107
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:21,571
Uh... Brad, look, I... I gotta go.
Somebody's here in my office.

108
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:22,574
Uh, yeah. Yeah.

109
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:26,695
Listen, uh, just keep an eye open
and call me if anyone fits that bill.

110
00:05:27,952 --> 00:05:29,272
It's rude to keep a lady waiting.

111
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,619
It's rude coming in someone's office
without knocking.

112
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:34,666
Your door was open.
Okay. We've got big trouble.

113
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:37,711
- Yeah. An abandoned baby.
- No, I was talking about Mel.

114
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:40,336
Wait. Someone abandoned that baby?

115
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:42,843
- Yeah.
- Well, what are you doing about it?

116
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:45,215
Well, I was talking to Brad
over at Grace Valley Hospital.

117
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:47,933
- Did you check the camps?
- Next on my list.

118
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:51,604
You know, by the way,
Miss Florence Nightingale out there,

119
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:53,854
she was about to call Social Services.

120
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:56,106
Well, uh, eventually,
someone might have to.

121
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:58,229
It... it's an abandoned baby.

122
00:05:58,316 --> 00:06:01,486
- Now you're gonna tell me what to do?
- I always tell you what to do.

123
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:06,319
Okay, baby aside,
you promised to give Mel a 30-day trial.

124
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:08,947
29 days to go. It's like a kid
countin' down to Christmas.

125
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:12,155
- You're an ass, is what you are.
- No time for sweet talk.

126
00:06:12,246 --> 00:06:14,076
She gave me her notice.

127
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:16,915
Well, then,
save your fury for Miss Monroe.

128
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:19,211
I mean, she's the one
who's lookin' to cut and run.

129
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:20,625
Shh.

130
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:32,017
Put a little honey on that.
She'll latch right on.

131
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,980
There's a risk of botulism.

132
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,440
- Oh, good heavens.
- It's a real risk.

133
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:37,651
So is starvation.

134
00:06:39,857 --> 00:06:42,397
I take it I can leave her with you?

135
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:45,411
I'm a certified nurse and midwife.

136
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:46,528
Is that a yes?

137
00:06:46,614 --> 00:06:47,614
Yes.

138
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,620
Shh.

139
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:57,543
Well, she's eating.

140
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:58,995
She could stop again.

141
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:00,915
You know,
we really need to find her mother

142
00:07:01,003 --> 00:07:02,963
or consider bringing in a specialist.

143
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:04,047
You're a midwife.

144
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:07,682
Feeding issues are a subspecialty.

145
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,810
Oh, Christ on a cracker.
Not in the real world, they aren't.

146
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,830
Is Connie activating the phone tree?

147
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:15,771
Ah, with her usual gusto.

148
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:17,942
- So, that covers all of Virgin River.
- Mm.

149
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:23,363
Hey, I gotta call you back.

150
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:25,992
No, no,
I'm just in the middle of something.

151
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:28,866
Okay. Yeah, I'll call you later.

152
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:30,991
Bye.

153
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:35,707
It's possible somebody dropped her
off while they were passing through.

154
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:37,208
Doc's gonna look into that.

155
00:07:37,915 --> 00:07:40,325
You know, it's a good thing
you're still in town.

156
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:42,553
Doc's not good with small humans.

157
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:45,298
Hell, sometimes he's not
so good with big humans either.

158
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:46,381
I heard that.

159
00:07:47,341 --> 00:07:49,641
I'm not finished with you, old man.

160
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:06,111
Mel gave notice because you
won't let her do what she came here to do.

161
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:07,864
What, take over my practice?

162
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:09,815
You know, she wanted
to give that baby away.

163
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:12,366
- That's not true. And...
- Yep.

164
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:13,450
Look...

165
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:17,908
you've relegated her to coffee and filing,

166
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:19,917
and that's not doing anyone any good.

167
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:21,599
Well, everyone's got to start somewhere.

168
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:24,127
She's a nurse, not a secretary.

169
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:27,222
If she came crying to you,
what she is, is city-soft.

170
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:28,838
It's a good thing we found out early.

171
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:34,178
In her old job, she used to deal with
dope fiends and criminals,

172
00:08:34,263 --> 00:08:35,933
but it's you she can't work with.

173
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:37,595
- Think about that.
- Yeah.

174
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:41,895
I'm thinking.

175
00:08:58,871 --> 00:08:59,871
Did she tell you?

176
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:01,366
Yeah.

177
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:03,456
You think she's serious about leaving?

178
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,633
She told me to start looking
for her replacement.

179
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:06,881
And I really can't blame her.

180
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:09,383
You know what?
If Doc could just get out of his own way,

181
00:09:09,465 --> 00:09:12,215
he would see
she's exactly what this town needs.

182
00:09:14,178 --> 00:09:16,638
You know,
I'm... headin' over to the cabin.

183
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:19,812
You know, I could speed things up
with the remodel.

184
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:21,492
Maybe if she had a place to call home...

185
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,351
That'll be a...
a lot of extra work for you.

186
00:09:23,437 --> 00:09:25,017
But we want her to stay, right?

187
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:26,266
Yes, we do.

188
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:29,527
Maybe if you took your time
looking for her replacement...

189
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:33,160
I haven't even started, and frankly,
it wasn't easy to get Mel here, so...

190
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:36,579
Maybe between the two of us,
we could... turn her around?

191
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:38,326
Yes.

192
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:41,172
Let's see if we can make Virgin River
a little more attractive to her.

193
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:43,331
Okay.

194
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:01,930
Hey, Joe.

195
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:03,098
- Is that a baby?
- Yeah.

196
00:10:03,185 --> 00:10:05,605
Somebody left her
on Doc's doorstep this morning.

197
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:07,318
Oh, my God. That's terrible.

198
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:09,568
She's hungry,
and I can't get her to take a bottle.

199
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:11,066
I've tried everything.

200
00:10:11,902 --> 00:10:13,072
I don't know what else to do.

201
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:15,494
- Is there anyone who can come help you?
- No.

202
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:18,413
No, I've tried everything, and it's...

203
00:10:18,492 --> 00:10:19,992
...it's the worst feeling.

204
00:10:20,077 --> 00:10:22,537
She's hungry, and I can't comfort her.

205
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:23,942
Are you sure this is a good idea?

206
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:26,518
There has to be someone
that can at least come give you a break.

207
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:27,752
Wait, I'm not that fragile.

208
00:10:27,835 --> 00:10:29,915
You need to stop worrying
about me so much.

209
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:31,174
It's in my DNA.

210
00:10:31,255 --> 00:10:34,625
You know I'm a midwife, right?
Babies are my job.

211
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:36,797
I get that, but you can do your job here.

212
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:41,723
I put in my notice, okay?

213
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:43,017
Oh, thank God.

214
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:45,660
I'll make up the guest room.
You can come in as late as you want.

215
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:48,436
No, I told Hope that I'd wait
until they found a replacement.

216
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:51,822
Joe, you know, when I... when I do leave,
I'm not coming back to LA.

217
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:52,981
What are you talking about?

218
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:54,277
Of course you're coming back.

219
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:56,492
No. Joey, there's too many memories there.

220
00:10:56,572 --> 00:10:57,822
No, this is your home.

221
00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:00,699
You have family and friends here
who love you.

222
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:02,995
- You don't understand.
- You're right. I don't.

223
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:05,119
I don't understand
why you're pushing everyone away.

224
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:09,004
- It's like you don't wanna feel better.
- No, it's not about that, okay? It...

225
00:11:10,544 --> 00:11:14,674
You're always trying to fix
my life, and my life cannot be fixed.

226
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:18,885
If you don't get that, I...
I can't help you.

227
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:22,097
I gotta go.

228
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:33,065
Me, you, you, you.

229
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:36,701
Joey, is that me or you in Mama's arms?

230
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:38,988
I'm over with Dad by the train.

231
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:40,873
So, Mama's holding me?

232
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,950
I was a really fat baby.

233
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:45,963
How come you look so little?

234
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:49,995
- Hey, go back.
- No.

235
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:53,129
Why? I wanna see what's on that page.

236
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:54,512
No, I'll get in trouble.

237
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:57,684
We're best friends. You can tell me.

238
00:11:59,593 --> 00:12:00,643
Please.

239
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:04,723
Fine.

240
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:08,016
Mom's not holding you in that picture.

241
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:09,772
It's our sister, Chloe.

242
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:11,064
Chloe?

243
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:13,726
She died before you were born.

244
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:15,526
We had a sister?

245
00:12:18,612 --> 00:12:21,122
Yeah, but don't tell Mom I told you.

246
00:12:21,198 --> 00:12:22,828
She'll get really mad.

247
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:24,582
I'll never tell.

248
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:27,158
I promise.

249
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:29,750
Cross my heart, hope to die.

250
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:32,535
I love you, Joey.

251
00:12:32,626 --> 00:12:34,626
I love you, too, squirt.

252
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:44,888
Chloe.

253
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,180
Do you like that?

254
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:51,017
Yeah, I do too.

255
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:56,649
You're gonna be okay.

256
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:05,326
- You okay?
- Yeah. Yeah.

257
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,290
You weren't kidding when
you said this was gonna be a lotta work.

258
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:11,671
On the upside, at $20 an hour,

259
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:14,669
you could end up saving enough
to pay for your first semester of college.

260
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:15,794
No need.

261
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:18,796
Soon as I graduate, I'm enlisting.

262
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:25,014
Ricky, things, uh...

263
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:27,141
It's not the same as when I signed up.

264
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:29,148
These days, you're gonna need
a college degree

265
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:33,853
- for any kind of job you're gonna want.
- The job I want is to be a marine.

266
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:38,148
What does your grandmother say
about all this, huh?

267
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:39,404
Well...

268
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:42,858
I was kind of hoping
you could help me tell her.

269
00:13:47,117 --> 00:13:48,117
Okay.

270
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:50,703
I will.

271
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:51,868
- Okay.
- Okay.

272
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:52,956
But, hey...

273
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:56,416
only if you apply
to a couple of schools...

274
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:58,211
as backup.

275
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:01,761
Okay. Yeah.

276
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:23,528
Jack.

277
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:27,986
- You okay?
- Yeah, yeah. I just, um...

278
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:30,623
Just had too much coffee. Here.

279
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:33,538
Why don't you clean that up?
Got work to do.

280
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:46,301
All right.

281
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:56,769
- Oh.
- Hi.

282
00:14:56,854 --> 00:14:58,814
- Hi.
- Connie and Hope both called me.

283
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:00,148
- I'm Lilly.
- Hi.

284
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:02,192
Mel. Is this from the whole town?

285
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:04,186
Uh, no, just me.

286
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:05,988
Oh, I have four grown children.

287
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:08,991
None of them are planning on making me
a grandmother any time soon, so...

288
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:10,834
I thought you could put this all
to good use.

289
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:12,578
Yes.

290
00:15:12,661 --> 00:15:13,661
How is she?

291
00:15:14,204 --> 00:15:16,424
Oh, well, she's not eating enough,

292
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:20,174
and I'm getting a little concerned.

293
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:22,252
Oh. You gonna wake her up?

294
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,510
Oh, no, not if I do this right.

295
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:28,926
I've never seen that before.

296
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:31,095
It's called dream feeding.

297
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,310
You do it when they're mostly asleep,

298
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:36,345
and if you're lucky,
their sucking reflex kicks in.

299
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:37,895
But it doesn't always work.

300
00:15:37,978 --> 00:15:39,098
Hm.

301
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:45,526
I have a bone to pick with you.

302
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:49,783
I'm all the way through the phone tree
when Stacey shows up to tell me

303
00:15:49,865 --> 00:15:51,775
that Joy heard Hope talking to Doc.

304
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:55,329
She thought she heard Doc say that you
wanted to give that beautiful baby away.

305
00:15:55,412 --> 00:15:57,082
Oh, no. There's been a misunderstanding.

306
00:15:57,164 --> 00:15:59,834
- I should hope so.
- No one is giving anyone away.

307
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:01,917
But at some point, Doc or myself

308
00:16:02,002 --> 00:16:03,882
will have to call
Child Protective Services.

309
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,803
- Says who?
- The State of California.

310
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:07,761
Oh, please.

311
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:10,594
Look, Social Services is set up

312
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:12,758
to handle this kind of situation
better than we are.

313
00:16:12,846 --> 00:16:14,846
It's not a situation. It's a baby.

314
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:17,643
Okay, well, Doc told me not to call.

315
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:19,976
- Thank goodness for small favors.
- It's okay.

316
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:22,733
You know,
Social Services isn't the enemy here.

317
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:23,645
Mm-hm.

318
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:26,032
Ultimately, they want the baby
to be with her mother.

319
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,360
You know what I think?

320
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:30,215
I think this is her home,
and you should mind your own business.

321
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:35,202
Okay. Well, this is my business,
and the town can't just keep her.

322
00:16:35,285 --> 00:16:36,945
- Why not?
- Because she's not a puppy.

323
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:41,705
I'm sure Lilly, along with everybody else
I've spoken to, agrees with me.

324
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:45,172
I... I think she's just trying to help
the baby and do what's right, so may...

325
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:48,554
Look, we don't need outsiders
tellin' us how to live.

326
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:51,094
In Virgin River, we take care of our own.

327
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:53,968
You big city types, you're all the same.

328
00:16:54,596 --> 00:16:56,346
Always thinking you know what's best.

329
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:59,232
Well, I'm here to tell you, you don't.

330
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:00,940
Let's go, Lilly.

331
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:06,441
It's okay.

332
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:50,685
- Oh, busy.
- Yeah, since breakfast.

333
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:56,198
Why did you promise him a job?

334
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:59,199
He gets in less trouble
when he's in Virgin River.

335
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:01,867
Well, so far, he's broken five plates,
three glasses,

336
00:18:01,955 --> 00:18:03,535
and is currently on my last nerve.

337
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:06,094
- Look, he's new to this.
- Yeah? What's that? Work?

338
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:07,248
Or a job?

339
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:11,589
Hey, look. I want to give him a reason
to stick around this time.

340
00:18:11,673 --> 00:18:12,673
All right, listen.

341
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:14,718
We both know denial's a dangerous thing.

342
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:16,352
Wh...

343
00:18:18,722 --> 00:18:19,722
Now if you'll excuse me,

344
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:23,597
I need to empty the dishwasher so that
Brady has some more things to break.

345
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,400
Hey, there.

346
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:32,985
Beer?

347
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:39,156
Ssh.

348
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:44,787
You're not Doc.

349
00:18:45,332 --> 00:18:49,042
- Uh... No, I'm... I'm Mel.
- The new nurse.

350
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:50,968
Yeah, that's me.
Can I help you with something?

351
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:52,966
Nothing personal, but, uh...

352
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:56,720
I'm not really okay
with you being a lady and all.

353
00:18:58,095 --> 00:18:59,635
Oh.

354
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:05,227
So, that's the little one that's
got everyone so worked up.

355
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:08,271
Yeah. I'm... I'm calling her Chloe.

356
00:19:08,355 --> 00:19:10,515
Had a collie named Chloe
when I was younger.

357
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:12,398
Oh, that girl could herd.

358
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:13,994
Uh... look, um...

359
00:19:14,903 --> 00:19:16,703
- Charlie.
- Charlie, uh, yeah,

360
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,530
I don't know when Doc will be back,

361
00:19:18,615 --> 00:19:21,115
but I can help you
with whatever brought you in today.

362
00:19:21,201 --> 00:19:22,701
Well, I think I'll come back later.

363
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:24,786
- You tell Doc I came by.
- I will.

364
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:27,540
Bye.

365
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:31,592
You know, everyone's talkin'

366
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:34,510
about you wanting to call those people
to come take the baby.

367
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:37,383
I get it.

368
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:39,135
I was adopted.

369
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:42,063
Had good foster parents
that turned into real parents.

370
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:45,016
Thanks, Charlie.

371
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:46,601
Yeah.

372
00:19:58,447 --> 00:19:59,277
Hey.

373
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:01,074
Hey. I dropped the pies off to Preacher.

374
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:02,488
Oh, no, I'm here for a latte.

375
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:05,996
Why, Jack Sheridan, I never thought
I'd see the day I'd steam milk for you.

376
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:07,709
No, not for me. For Mel.

377
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:10,459
Aah. Suddenly, everything seems right
in the world again.

378
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:12,022
But you know what? Let's make it two.

379
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:14,304
Wow, she's having a bad day, huh?

380
00:20:14,796 --> 00:20:17,126
Well, she's going through some stuff.

381
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:19,636
Yeah. Connie came by earlier.

382
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:22,798
Oh, I bet she did.
Thanks to her, Mel's the talk of the town.

383
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:26,889
You know... Look, I know it happens,

384
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:30,265
but I can't wrap my head around
why a mother would abandon her baby.

385
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:32,981
Well, we don't know the mother's story.

386
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:36,494
Maybe she didn't have a choice
but to do what she did.

387
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:39,777
I mean, no mother in her right mind
wants to give up her child.

388
00:20:39,863 --> 00:20:41,623
I know I'd die to protect my son.

389
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:44,786
Do you think she'll call Social Services?

390
00:20:45,452 --> 00:20:46,752
Mm... I don't know.

391
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:48,908
I'm not a big fan
of child welfare agencies.

392
00:20:51,124 --> 00:20:53,044
It's just...
you see it on the news all the time.

393
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:55,438
Sometimes the people that are supposed
to make things better

394
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:57,012
end up making things worse.

395
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:58,089
Thank you.

396
00:20:58,173 --> 00:20:59,843
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey, Christopher.

397
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:02,585
I think Preacher could use a hand
flipping pancakes tomorrow.

398
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:04,638
- If it's okay with your mom.
- It's fine.

399
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:06,811
- See you tomorrow, Jack.
- See ya, buddy.

400
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:07,890
Hey.

401
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:10,849
Do you know how much I love you?

402
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:12,306
Mom.

403
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:14,647
Off you go.

404
00:21:22,072 --> 00:21:24,872
- Hey.
- Oh, I'm so happy to see you.

405
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,660
And you too.

406
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:30,536
- You're not gonna join me?
- No, no, no, they're both for you.

407
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:31,792
Mm.

408
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:36,501
- Ah. You're a good man.
- And you're a good woman.

409
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:40,130
I don't think my sister
would agree with you.

410
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:42,724
- Hm?
- We didn't have the best phone call.

411
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:45,351
Don't beat yourself up.
You've been under a lot of stress.

412
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:47,639
Look, I've got four sisters.
I know how they can be.

413
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:51,597
Well, she practically raised me,
so she's used to bossing me around.

414
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:53,645
- Mm-hm.
- She's a force of nature.

415
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:54,899
Obviously runs in the family.

416
00:21:57,065 --> 00:21:58,435
How's our girl?

417
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:02,493
She's still not eating enough,
and I'm running out of ideas.

418
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:04,565
Still no word from Doc?

419
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:08,326
No. And I can't, you know,
sit around waiting,

420
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:09,620
knowing that she's hungry.

421
00:22:09,703 --> 00:22:12,963
I mean, he's on some wild-goose chase,
trying to keep Social Services away.

422
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,290
And we don't know where the mother is.
She could be in...

423
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:16,745
a whole other state by now.

424
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:19,585
Look, I promise you,
Doc believes he's doing the right thing.

425
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:24,091
Never in my career have I seen a doctor
just throw procedure out the window

426
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:25,426
and leave nothing in its place.

427
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:27,470
If he'd worked anywhere
other than Virgin River,

428
00:22:27,554 --> 00:22:29,354
he might understand where I'm coming from.

429
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:31,431
Well, he worked in Seattle
before he came here.

430
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:34,056
He was head of Internal Medicine, I think.
Northwest Hospital.

431
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:36,614
They have one of the best
transplant centers in the country.

432
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:37,858
- Mm-hm.
- Let me guess.

433
00:22:37,939 --> 00:22:39,899
He got fired for making up his own rules?

434
00:22:39,983 --> 00:22:41,493
Oh, no, he quit.

435
00:22:41,985 --> 00:22:44,605
Yeah, something about
too much paperwork and politics.

436
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:45,566
Not enough doctoring.

437
00:22:45,655 --> 00:22:46,865
Hm.

438
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:49,615
Here, you want me to take her?

439
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,040
No, I got it.

440
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:52,249
No, let me.

441
00:22:52,579 --> 00:22:54,499
I've got a lot of nieces and nephews.

442
00:22:58,877 --> 00:22:59,917
There you go.

443
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:02,705
It's okay.

444
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:06,178
Look, I spent 20-plus years
following protocol in the Corps,

445
00:23:06,259 --> 00:23:09,009
so I get why this is so hard for you.

446
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:11,306
Yeah. Systems are in place for a reason.

447
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:13,730
Yeah, but the thing you gotta remember
about this town,

448
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:15,059
it's a bit off the beaten path.

449
00:23:15,143 --> 00:23:18,153
So, people have learned to rely on
each other more than the outside world.

450
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:21,650
So, the rules out there,
sometimes they just don't apply here.

451
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:23,693
Yeah. I'm just trying to do
what's best for her.

452
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:24,899
I know.

453
00:23:24,986 --> 00:23:27,673
And if I'm the only one that thinks
she needs more than a phone tree,

454
00:23:27,697 --> 00:23:29,447
then so be it.

455
00:23:30,033 --> 00:23:31,833
Well, just so you know, you're not alone.

456
00:23:32,327 --> 00:23:33,577
Okay? I'm on your side.

457
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:41,795
Latte for Mel.

458
00:23:41,878 --> 00:23:42,878
Yeah, thanks.

459
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:46,593
- Large latte, Mark?
- Yes, please.

460
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:49,386
- Hey.
- Hey.

461
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:51,180
Great minds.

462
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:53,096
Oh. Yeah.

463
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:54,561
- How's the head?
- Better.

464
00:23:54,641 --> 00:23:57,891
- And the job?
- Uh, well, never... never a dull moment.

465
00:23:58,311 --> 00:24:00,311
- Which I like.
- You're an adrenaline junkie?

466
00:24:00,897 --> 00:24:02,897
Well, only in certain situations.

467
00:24:03,358 --> 00:24:05,938
Um... I went skydiving once. I hated it.

468
00:24:06,027 --> 00:24:08,607
Before I even boarded the plane,
I felt like I was gonna die.

469
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:11,297
- Why did you get on the plane?
- I was trying to impress a woman.

470
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:14,617
- Oh. How did that work out?
- I ended up with a migraine.

471
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:18,620
And from what I'm told,
she ended up with the instructor.

472
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:20,207
Oh, ouch.

473
00:24:21,209 --> 00:24:22,459
Hey, uh... what do you do?

474
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:25,554
I mean, what do you do
when you're not working?

475
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:26,630
Run.

476
00:24:27,382 --> 00:24:28,632
Trail run, especially.

477
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:30,677
But there's really not anywhere
to go around here.

478
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:34,349
Actually, I have a few secret spots
that I could show you that are... uh...

479
00:24:34,931 --> 00:24:35,950
Sorry. Uh...

480
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:37,484
- I mean...
- Your latte, Mark.

481
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:39,019
Thank you. Uh...

482
00:24:42,063 --> 00:24:43,323
You have such a nice smile.

483
00:24:45,233 --> 00:24:46,493
Uh...

484
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:48,282
Okay. I gotta go.

485
00:24:52,073 --> 00:24:53,583
- Yeah.
- Okay.

486
00:24:54,618 --> 00:24:56,868
So... I'll just see you around campus?

487
00:24:57,496 --> 00:24:58,496
Yeah.

488
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:02,246
I just put her down.

489
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:07,086
- Uh... I'm sorry. What?
- I said I just put her down.

490
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:09,046
Oh. Thank you.

491
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:13,218
Yeah. I better get back to the bar
to make sure Preacher isn't killing Brady.

492
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:14,845
Oh, they don't get along?

493
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:16,850
Please. The only thing
those two have in common

494
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:18,602
is a deep hatred for one another.

495
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:20,684
Yeah.

496
00:25:21,144 --> 00:25:22,144
Bye.

497
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:38,579
Who we got here?

498
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:52,049
Thanks.

499
00:25:53,927 --> 00:25:55,507
- Jimmy.
- Hey, Doc.

500
00:25:55,595 --> 00:25:57,555
- Hey.
- Thought you forgot about us.

501
00:25:57,639 --> 00:25:59,219
No. You know better.

502
00:25:59,307 --> 00:26:00,227
How's the leg?

503
00:26:00,308 --> 00:26:02,388
Yeah, the medicine you gave me
doing the trick.

504
00:26:02,477 --> 00:26:03,621
- Yeah.
- Still a little sore.

505
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:06,916
That's what happens when you get stabbed
with a pair of trimming shears.

506
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,140
Listen, before we get started,

507
00:26:08,191 --> 00:26:10,991
I was hopin'
to talk to that young pregnant girl.

508
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:12,243
Which one?

509
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:16,070
Oh, she was young. She was, uh,
dark-haired and very, very pregnant.

510
00:26:16,157 --> 00:26:17,987
- Uh... That's Maxine.
- Ah.

511
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:19,946
Yeah. I haven't seen her in a while.

512
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:22,407
But, uh... Spencer...

513
00:26:23,456 --> 00:26:25,916
Spencer and her used to be somethin'.

514
00:26:26,876 --> 00:26:27,916
He's over there.

515
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:33,007
Spencer?

516
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:36,385
- Yeah, who wants to know?
- I'm lookin' for Maxine.

517
00:26:37,637 --> 00:26:38,637
Does she owe you money?

518
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:40,682
No, just wanna talk.

519
00:26:41,224 --> 00:26:42,934
Well, how much is it worth to you?

520
00:26:46,896 --> 00:26:50,396
See, Maxine, she...
she lit out of here a few weeks ago.

521
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:53,320
That's all I really remember.

522
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:56,158
Okay, hey.

523
00:26:57,741 --> 00:27:02,121
Look, someone said that she was workin'
at a... a gas station in Clear River.

524
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:05,332
I guess she's too good for me now.

525
00:27:06,082 --> 00:27:08,712
She can raise that damn kid on her own
for all I care.

526
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:13,797
Thanks.

527
00:27:17,594 --> 00:27:20,474
So, anything major I should know about?

528
00:27:20,555 --> 00:27:22,465
Uh, just all the usual stuff.

529
00:27:22,557 --> 00:27:25,687
There's a cough goin' around.
A few cuts and bruises.

530
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:27,809
Oh, there might... might be
a guy with a broken nose

531
00:27:27,854 --> 00:27:29,024
from a fight the other night.

532
00:27:29,105 --> 00:27:29,975
- Yeah.
- Mm.

533
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:32,605
- Well, I'll get it all sorted out.
- You always do.

534
00:27:33,193 --> 00:27:34,193
Okay.

535
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:36,989
All right. Hey.

536
00:27:37,947 --> 00:27:38,947
Okay.

537
00:27:39,532 --> 00:27:41,332
I'll take the worst first, huh?

538
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:51,168
Here you go.

539
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:06,767
Hey.

540
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:08,138
- Hey.
- Wow.

541
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:11,058
Look at you, hm?

542
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:14,820
Well, you are gonna be
a little heartbreaker, hm?

543
00:28:14,901 --> 00:28:16,361
- Yes, you are.
- Mm.

544
00:28:16,569 --> 00:28:19,859
- I got a new salad on the menu.
- Oh, great. I'll take that.

545
00:28:20,824 --> 00:28:22,084
You know, I can make it to go.

546
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:24,910
No, that's okay. I'll have it here.

547
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:29,210
Well, you look like hell.

548
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:30,790
Hi, Hope.

549
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:32,786
Obviously worn out.

550
00:28:33,503 --> 00:28:36,093
And like any woman who spends
a whole day with an infant,

551
00:28:36,172 --> 00:28:37,172
you need a break.

552
00:28:37,757 --> 00:28:39,127
- Wouldn't you agree, Jack?
- Hm?

553
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:42,216
No, I've only been able to get her
to take a couple ounces.

554
00:28:42,303 --> 00:28:44,365
- I need to keep working with her.
- You're stressed.

555
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:47,179
- Babies pick up on stress.
- What are you implying?

556
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:49,847
I'm not implying anything.
I'm saying you need a break.

557
00:28:49,936 --> 00:28:52,226
Take her somewhere
where she can relax a little.

558
00:28:52,313 --> 00:28:53,633
Yeah. Half an hour couldn't hurt.

559
00:28:56,776 --> 00:28:58,106
Okay. Um...

560
00:28:59,362 --> 00:29:00,532
I have my cell phone on me.

561
00:29:00,613 --> 00:29:03,703
I'm sure you do.
Now, stop worrying and get.

562
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:04,992
Go.

563
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,340
I don't know what I'm more surprised at,

564
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:21,052
that you built a batting cage for yourself
in the middle of the woods,

565
00:29:21,134 --> 00:29:22,644
or that I'm holding a bat

566
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:24,429
and wearing a helmet.

567
00:29:24,512 --> 00:29:25,892
Are we really doing this?

568
00:29:25,972 --> 00:29:27,562
How do you usually burn off stress?

569
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,730
- I run.
- Whew.

570
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:31,644
- One of those people, huh?
- What is that supposed to mean?

571
00:29:31,728 --> 00:29:35,108
You know, "those people."
People who constantly crave productivity.

572
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:37,820
My theory is that runners
are the same people who stress clean.

573
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:38,901
You do a little of that?

574
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:40,113
You're ridiculous.

575
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:43,525
And for your information,
I ran track in high school.

576
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:44,615
All right.

577
00:29:46,493 --> 00:29:48,163
Hit the button, runner.

578
00:29:49,954 --> 00:29:51,044
Oh!

579
00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:53,459
- Oh!
- Bet I know what you did in high school.

580
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:56,092
Don't be afraid to let go once in a while.

581
00:29:56,169 --> 00:29:57,299
I can let go.

582
00:29:58,838 --> 00:30:00,218
- I can.
- Really?

583
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:01,938
- Yes.
- All right. Wanna give it a whirl?

584
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:03,509
Yeah.

585
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:05,677
- Come on, then.
- I'll give it a whirl.

586
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:07,262
- Okay.
- Ahem.

587
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:08,347
You ready?

588
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:13,769
Here we go.

589
00:30:15,605 --> 00:30:16,515
Ohh!

590
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:18,846
That's all right.
You're just getting a feel for the bat.

591
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:23,531
See... choke up a little.

592
00:30:23,613 --> 00:30:25,323
- What? What does that mean?
- Here.

593
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:27,914
- Just... take your bottom hand.
- Yeah.

594
00:30:28,409 --> 00:30:31,539
Closer to the... base.
Take this hand up...

595
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:33,015
- Yeah.
- ...to meet your right hand.

596
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:34,119
All the way up. Yeah.

597
00:30:34,874 --> 00:30:35,754
- Okay.
- Hold it here?

598
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:37,094
Bring this off your shoulder.

599
00:30:37,627 --> 00:30:39,247
- Widen your stance.
- Yeah.

600
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,550
♪ So come with me ♪

601
00:30:42,632 --> 00:30:44,512
You might wanna keep your eye
on the ball there.

602
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:45,721
Okay.

603
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:47,643
- You ready?
- Yeah.

604
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,010
- Okay. You got this.
- Okay.

605
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:52,515
♪ Yeah, yeah, yeah, here we go ♪

606
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,430
- Oh!
- Whoo-hoo!

607
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:54,558
- I hit it!
- Yeah!

608
00:30:54,644 --> 00:30:56,234
- I hit the ball!
- All right!

609
00:30:58,147 --> 00:31:01,027
Well, I wonder if Doc had any luck
locating the baby's mother.

610
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:02,359
Oh, yeah, me too.

611
00:31:02,443 --> 00:31:03,443
If not?

612
00:31:04,487 --> 00:31:08,117
Well, hopefully, Social Services
can locate her or a relative.

613
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:12,118
If not, then good adoptive parents.

614
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:14,868
She needs her mom.

615
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:15,956
Yeah.

616
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:17,998
Are you close with yours?

617
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:19,753
Yeah, very.

618
00:31:20,461 --> 00:31:22,011
Yeah? What about your father?

619
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:24,967
- Uh, not so much.
- No?

620
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:27,339
Oh, we don't really see
eye-to-eye on things.

621
00:31:28,595 --> 00:31:30,425
He never wanted me to be a marine.

622
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:33,015
How about you?

623
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:36,559
Oh, technically I'm an orphan.

624
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:40,975
- Technically?
- Well, I lost my mother when I was 11,

625
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:42,935
and my dad about ten years ago.

626
00:31:43,026 --> 00:31:44,276
- Yeah.
- That's rough.

627
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:46,321
Yeah, my mom had cancer.

628
00:31:46,654 --> 00:31:48,204
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah.

629
00:31:48,656 --> 00:31:52,446
But, you know, she's... she's the reason
I decided to become a nurse.

630
00:31:53,536 --> 00:31:56,036
When the time came for me
to go say goodbye to her,

631
00:31:56,664 --> 00:31:58,674
I... I didn't wanna go.

632
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,550
My dad and my sister, Joey,
they went into my mother's room,

633
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:05,839
and I just ran down the hall.

634
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:09,722
I guess I... I thought
if I didn't say goodbye...

635
00:32:10,553 --> 00:32:13,063
then, you know,
she couldn't actually leave.

636
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:17,602
Um... I don't really remember
how long I was alone,

637
00:32:17,685 --> 00:32:21,055
but, um... after a while,
one of my mother's nurses,

638
00:32:21,147 --> 00:32:23,437
she came down, and...

639
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:28,740
she sat down next to me,
and she didn't say anything.

640
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:30,874
You know, she just...

641
00:32:31,991 --> 00:32:34,081
she just held me and let me cry.

642
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:41,211
And later, we went to my mother's room,
and I said goodbye.

643
00:32:45,421 --> 00:32:48,881
But that nurse got me through
one of the hardest days of my life.

644
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:52,804
And it was in that moment
that I realized that this...

645
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:55,603
this is what I wanna do for other people.

646
00:32:58,267 --> 00:33:02,107
And now, every time I walk
into an exam room or a hospital, I...

647
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:05,192
I think about my mother.

648
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:09,489
I'm gonna go check on Chloe.

649
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:32,431
You look very natural with a baby.

650
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:35,514
Please. Children are too much work.

651
00:33:36,639 --> 00:33:38,729
I decided to raise husbands instead.

652
00:33:38,808 --> 00:33:41,348
Oh, yeah. How'd that work out for you?

653
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:45,516
One was my soul mate.
One was the bane of my existence.

654
00:33:45,606 --> 00:33:48,936
And one was...
the best three months of my life.

655
00:33:49,444 --> 00:33:50,284
No regrets?

656
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:54,241
I don't have regrets. I make choices,
and then I live with the consequences.

657
00:33:55,658 --> 00:33:57,238
I think we're alike that way.

658
00:33:57,910 --> 00:33:58,910
Yeah...

659
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:00,115
Sh, sh.

660
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:02,624
- I know my own mind.
- I like that about you.

661
00:34:06,085 --> 00:34:08,415
You're going to call Social Services,
aren't you?

662
00:34:09,422 --> 00:34:11,132
Yeah, I should've called them
this morning.

663
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:12,795
You gotta do what you think's best.

664
00:34:19,098 --> 00:34:21,058
Do you wanna try some milk?

665
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:23,936
Let's go try some milk, okay?

666
00:34:26,022 --> 00:34:27,022
Hello?

667
00:34:28,524 --> 00:34:29,364
Oh, Lilly.

668
00:34:29,442 --> 00:34:30,442
Hey.

669
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:35,776
Found some extra onesies.
You can never have too many.

670
00:34:35,865 --> 00:34:38,025
- Oh, those are beautiful.
- Yeah.

671
00:34:38,451 --> 00:34:40,371
- I'm sure Chloe will love them.
- Chloe?

672
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:43,620
It's just temporary.
It's better than calling her baby.

673
00:34:43,706 --> 00:34:44,916
I like it.

674
00:34:46,959 --> 00:34:48,589
Actually, the...

675
00:34:49,295 --> 00:34:51,415
...the onesies are just an excuse
to come and see you.

676
00:34:51,464 --> 00:34:52,554
Wait, is something wrong?

677
00:34:52,632 --> 00:34:55,052
Connie shouldn't have said
those things to you today.

678
00:34:55,134 --> 00:34:57,434
I feel terrible I didn't step in
and say something.

679
00:34:57,512 --> 00:34:58,812
Oh, thank you.

680
00:34:58,888 --> 00:35:01,568
But I'm used to dealing with people
when they're stressed and angry.

681
00:35:02,975 --> 00:35:06,475
Yeah, I... I would be happy
to look after Chloe for a little while

682
00:35:06,562 --> 00:35:08,692
so you could at least go take a shower
and change.

683
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:12,403
You know, I just took a break,
and I really should try to feed her again.

684
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:16,566
Come on. Aww.

685
00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:17,656
Here.

686
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:18,990
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Come on.

687
00:35:19,075 --> 00:35:19,945
There you go.

688
00:35:20,034 --> 00:35:21,204
Look at you.

689
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:23,541
Oh!

690
00:35:24,831 --> 00:35:26,711
Wow, you really do have the touch.

691
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:28,711
- Four babies, remember?
- Yeah.

692
00:35:29,669 --> 00:35:30,879
You go on.

693
00:35:31,587 --> 00:35:33,667
Get cleaned up.
I'm gonna try and feed her.

694
00:35:33,756 --> 00:35:35,046
- I don't know.
- Oh.

695
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:37,513
Listen, none of my babies
liked taking a bottle.

696
00:35:37,593 --> 00:35:40,473
This one's no different.
But I have tricks.

697
00:35:42,181 --> 00:35:44,021
Okay. I would love a hot shower.

698
00:35:45,017 --> 00:35:48,227
All right. I'm just over at the Fitches',
so it won't take long.

699
00:35:48,312 --> 00:35:49,732
Oh, take your time.

700
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:51,106
Okay.

701
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:54,401
Hey.

702
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:40,025
You have reached the after-hours number
of the Eureka Social...

703
00:36:45,661 --> 00:36:46,661
Hey, how'd it go?

704
00:36:48,122 --> 00:36:51,462
Look, uh... I appreciate the job,
I just...

705
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:53,375
I don't think it's for me.

706
00:36:54,086 --> 00:36:55,706
Hey, look, first days are the roughest.

707
00:36:58,299 --> 00:36:59,879
I don't want to bus tables. And I...

708
00:36:59,967 --> 00:37:01,137
Wanna break dishes?

709
00:37:03,262 --> 00:37:05,392
Hey, you know what?
Just, hey, sleep on it.

710
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:07,847
Brady, we'll talk about it tomorrow, okay?

711
00:37:15,024 --> 00:37:17,694
Look, he's trying to make a fresh start.
Just ease up a bit.

712
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:21,157
How many times
can one person start over?

713
00:37:21,614 --> 00:37:22,994
As many as it takes.

714
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:25,584
Jesus, you're one of the most
forgiving people I know.

715
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:26,910
But not when it comes to Brady.

716
00:37:26,994 --> 00:37:29,164
Well, he may have you fooled, but not me.

717
00:37:29,538 --> 00:37:31,418
Hell, he thinks any straight job
is beneath him.

718
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:33,667
Well, he's here.

719
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:35,670
He's trying.

720
00:37:37,672 --> 00:37:39,302
You really think he's changed?

721
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:45,929
Hey.

722
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:49,095
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I'll see you soon.

723
00:38:02,321 --> 00:38:03,321
You're back.

724
00:38:03,698 --> 00:38:06,448
Yeah, Lilly told me you'd be over here.

725
00:38:07,618 --> 00:38:08,658
Did you find the mother?

726
00:38:08,744 --> 00:38:13,084
Well, there was a young woman
in one of the pot camps outside of town.

727
00:38:13,165 --> 00:38:15,785
And she was seven months pregnant
last time I saw her.

728
00:38:15,876 --> 00:38:16,746
So, it's her?

729
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:18,796
Well, it could be, but she left the camp.

730
00:38:18,879 --> 00:38:21,879
I tracked her into Clear River,
and, you know, I came up empty.

731
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:25,086
Well, Jack gave me the impression
that those camps aren't very clean.

732
00:38:25,177 --> 00:38:27,557
Oh, no runnin' water,
limited electricity...

733
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:29,098
Not the best sanitation. No.

734
00:38:29,181 --> 00:38:32,231
All right, well,
the baby was left in a clean onesie,

735
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:33,390
with a clean blanket,

736
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:35,237
and a note written
on a clean piece of paper.

737
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:37,582
- Doesn't really sound like the camps.
- I have other leads,

738
00:38:37,606 --> 00:38:39,186
and I'm gonna start in the morning.

739
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:43,107
And I can see if Connie or Lilly
can keep the baby tonight.

740
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,880
Well, you should know that the baby
is still rejecting the bottle.

741
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:50,695
Well, in my experience,
a baby will eat when they're ready.

742
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:53,249
She'll be okay for one more night.

743
00:38:55,541 --> 00:38:57,841
I called that after-hours number
in Eureka.

744
00:38:58,627 --> 00:39:00,427
Social Services
is coming to get her tomorrow.

745
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:02,173
You had... you had no right!

746
00:39:02,256 --> 00:39:06,136
No, I have a responsibility and a duty
to act in the best interests of that baby.

747
00:39:06,218 --> 00:39:07,978
And I shouldn't have waited all day
to do it,

748
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:09,762
but I did so out of respect for you.

749
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:12,057
Respect? Respect!

750
00:39:12,141 --> 00:39:14,061
Yeah, look. I'm sorry we disagree on this,

751
00:39:14,143 --> 00:39:16,903
but the baby's welfare
is more important than your ego.

752
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:19,189
Oh.

753
00:39:20,399 --> 00:39:23,439
Well, you know,
I know this is just a formality

754
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:26,027
since you've already given notice
to Hope, but...

755
00:39:27,823 --> 00:39:30,703
you... are fired.

756
00:39:31,827 --> 00:39:33,157
Fired.

757
00:40:03,484 --> 00:40:04,944
- Hey.
- Hey.

758
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:07,660
What kept you?

759
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:09,906
Work.

760
00:40:13,536 --> 00:40:14,576
You okay?

761
00:40:16,705 --> 00:40:17,745
Yeah, just...

762
00:40:18,624 --> 00:40:20,704
Preacher and Brady
are at each other's throats again.

763
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:24,131
Makes me feel like I gotta be
some kind of parental...

764
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:28,130
I don't wanna talk about work.

765
00:40:30,344 --> 00:40:31,344
Come here.

766
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:40,056
Uh, listen.

767
00:40:40,604 --> 00:40:41,654
