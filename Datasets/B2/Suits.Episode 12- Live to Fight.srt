anything

00:00:16,283 --> 00:00:17,883

Harvey Specter.

I'm throwing you
a goddamn lifeline!

11
00:00:21,793 --> 00:00:23,819
- I want to tell Jeff
the truth about Mike Ross.

12
00:00:23,824 --> 00:00:25,262
- He told you he loved you,
didn't he?

13
00:00:25,263 --> 00:00:26,659
- I just don't want to lie
to him anymore.

14
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:29,760
- Your whole story about how
Louis got his name on the door

15
00:00:29,764 --> 00:00:30,830
is bullshit!

16
00:00:30,831 --> 00:00:32,461
- And I came here
to tell you the truth.

17
00:00:32,466 --> 00:00:34,126
- It's over.
We're done.

for a second

00:00:35,302 --> 00:00:36,602
that you would even consider

20
00:00:36,604 --> 00:00:39,204
an idea so disgusting
as turning on Harvey.

21
00:00:39,206 --> 00:00:40,766
- The only reason
I thought about it

22
00:00:40,775 --> 00:00:44,275
is because I am scared to death
of you going to prison.

23
00:00:44,278 --> 00:00:46,608
- I explicitly told you
to stay away from Mike's case.

00:00:46,614 --> 00:00:47,747

you get it.

they're gonna come for me.

coming back to me?

you see your father,

maybe you explain to him
you put his life on the line

00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:34,268
for the man you work for.

105
00:04:34,275 --> 00:04:39,435

I'd say this to another woman,

a cold, heartless bitch.

Why don't I just leave that

- Why good?

138

- Because you told me

keep things like that from me,

00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:52,975
- The very one.

161

would be so appreciated.

171
00:07:16,036 --> 00:07:18,296
- Yeah.
That's more like it.

172
00:07:18,305 --> 00:07:19,365
- I can do even better.

173
00:07:19,373 --> 00:07:22,573
Please, make yourself at home.
Take the day.

174
00:07:22,576 --> 00:07:26,806

00:07:39,726 --> 00:07:41,386
- You're here.
- I am.

177
00:07:41,395 --> 00:07:42,655
- It's good to have you back,
Harvey.

178
00:07:42,663 --> 00:07:44,301
- Good to be back, Donna.

179
00:07:44,302 --> 00:07:45,728
All right,
enough sentimentality.

180
00:07:45,732 --> 00:07:46,966
I need you to...

181
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:48,867
- Clear your schedule for
the next two months? Done.

182
00:07:48,869 --> 00:07:51,269
I also gave half your business
to the partners that backed you

183
00:07:51,271 --> 00:07:52,939
and the rest
to Jessica and Louis.

184
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:54,140
- I didn't ask you to do that.

185
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:57,677
- No, you asked me
to come back to your desk.

186
00:07:57,678 --> 00:08:00,408
- I sure as hell did.

187
00:08:00,414 --> 00:08:01,681
- What's next?

188
00:08:01,682 --> 00:08:04,016
- What's next is,
get Mike into this office,

189
00:08:04,017 --> 00:08:05,477
and I don't want him wearing
casual clothes;

190
00:08:05,486 --> 00:08:07,316
I want him
with his Superman outfit on.

191
00:08:07,321 --> 00:08:08,551
- He's gonna need
a hell of a lot more

192
00:08:08,555 --> 00:08:10,215
than a cape and some tights,
because I just got

193
00:08:10,224 --> 00:08:12,524
a special delivery
from the U.S. Attorney's office.

194
00:08:12,526 --> 00:08:14,356
- Don't tell me;
she's issued subpoenas

195
00:08:14,361 --> 00:08:15,961
for every case
Mike's ever touched.

196
00:08:15,963 --> 00:08:17,603
- She issued subpoenas
for anything

197
00:08:17,604 --> 00:08:20,398
anyone at this firm
has ever touched.

198
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,600
- What does that mean?

199
00:08:21,602 --> 00:08:24,372
- It means they're not just
after Mike anymore.

200
00:08:24,373 --> 00:08:27,240
They're officially
coming after all of us.

201
00:08:27,241 --> 00:08:29,311
- Mike's already here.
I'll get him.

202
00:08:30,777 --> 00:08:33,346
- I'm telling you, Harvey,
this move is no joke.

203
00:08:33,347 --> 00:08:35,577
That woman gets in the door,
she will find something

204
00:08:35,582 --> 00:08:38,682
to pressure someone into saying
whatever she wants,

205
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:40,885
and I'll be damned if I'll
let her rifle through my house.

206
00:08:40,888 --> 00:08:42,088
- What exactly are you saying?

207
00:08:42,089 --> 00:08:44,389
- I'm saying we need
outside counsel.

208
00:08:44,391 --> 00:08:46,761
- Absolutely not.
There's nobody we can trust.

209
00:08:46,762 --> 00:08:48,360
- There is one person
we can trust,

210
00:08:48,362 --> 00:08:50,432
because you already told her
Mike's goddamn secret.

211
00:08:50,433 --> 00:08:52,730
- Jessica, I am not bringing
Scottie into this thing.

212
00:08:52,733 --> 00:08:54,101
I'm telling you
I can handle this.

213
00:08:54,102 --> 00:08:56,071
- You don't even have a strategy
to stop these subpoenas.

214
00:08:56,072 --> 00:08:58,599
- Well, then I guess
it's a good thing I do.

215
00:08:58,605 --> 00:09:01,535
- Well, then why don't you stop
patting yourself on the back

216
00:09:01,542 --> 00:09:02,912
and start telling me
what the hell it is?

217
00:09:02,913 --> 00:09:04,210
- We go on offense.

218
00:09:04,211 --> 00:09:05,678
- What exactly does that mean?

219
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:07,109
- It means that
we don't have to prove

220
00:09:07,114 --> 00:09:08,714
that she can't subpoena
our records;

221
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:10,615
she has to prove that she can.

222
00:09:10,617 --> 00:09:12,177
And she doesn't have
a shred of evidence

223
00:09:12,185 --> 00:09:13,545
proving that you knew about me.

224
00:09:13,554 --> 00:09:15,254
- If she got those subpoenas
in the first place,

225
00:09:15,255 --> 00:09:16,515
she must have something.

226
00:09:16,523 --> 00:09:17,993
- Wrong, I worked
in the D.A.'s office

227
00:09:17,994 --> 00:09:19,621
for five years.

228
00:09:19,626 --> 00:09:21,586
Judges give out subpoenas
like candy.

229
00:09:21,595 --> 00:09:23,725
- Then I suggest the two of you
get the hell on down there

230
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:25,900
and take
that woman's candy away.

231
00:09:28,669 --> 00:09:30,569
- The fact is, Your Honor,
she has no grounds

232
00:09:30,571 --> 00:09:32,401
to even issue these things
in the first place.

233
00:09:32,406 --> 00:09:33,636
- What is he even doing here?

234
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,710
- I'm here because I'm a lawyer

235
00:09:34,711 --> 00:09:36,268
and I'm innocent
until proven guilty.

236
00:09:36,276 --> 00:09:38,036
And those subpoenas aren't
about coming after me;

237
00:09:38,045 --> 00:09:39,505
they're about coming after him.

238
00:09:39,513 --> 00:09:40,953
- You're damn right they are,
because there's no way

239
00:09:40,954 --> 00:09:42,348
he didn't know you're a fraud.

240
00:09:42,349 --> 00:09:44,979
- Where exactly is your evidence
of either one of those things?

241
00:09:44,985 --> 00:09:47,585
- I see. They're not trying
to fight these subpoenas.

242
00:09:47,588 --> 00:09:50,418
They're trying to get me to turn
over whatever evidence I have,

243
00:09:50,424 --> 00:09:52,862
which I don't have to do
for another three weeks.

244
00:09:52,863 --> 00:09:54,859
- You'll do whatever I say
you have to do.

245
00:09:54,861 --> 00:09:57,261
Now, I want to know
what started this whole thing.

246
00:09:57,264 --> 00:10:00,333
- We received an anonymous email
from a reputable source.

247
00:10:00,334 --> 00:10:02,372
- Yeah, and a stranger
called me the other day

248
00:10:02,373 --> 00:10:03,769
saying you killed six people.

249
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,370
Can I subpoena her bank records?

250
00:10:05,372 --> 00:10:06,639
- You think this is a joke?

251
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,108
- You're damn right
this isn't a joke.

252
00:10:08,109 --> 00:10:10,208
I'm being accused of a crime
based on some bullshit email

253
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:11,510
no one's even seen.

254
00:10:11,511 --> 00:10:13,611
- I'd ask if you have that email
on you, Ms. Gibbs,

255
00:10:13,614 --> 00:10:15,914
but I wouldn't want to put you
in the position of lying to me,

256
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:17,176

288
00:11:27,054 --> 00:11:29,388
I was wondering when you were
gonna show up at my door.

289
00:11:29,389 --> 00:11:30,789
- So you've heard
about Mike Ross.

Now I finally know what you were
hiding from me the whole time.

But what I don't know

I'm here to ask for your help.

298

- You want me to represent
the firm.

00:11:51,712 --> 00:11:55,152
- If it comes to it,
I want you to represent me.

- Jeff, please.

302
00:12:00,787 --> 00:12:02,487
I made the mistake
of not trusting you once.

I don't want to make
that same mistake again.

304

me the truth about everything

you were gonna turn me in.

I was worried about
putting you in a position

310

taken in changes everything.

320
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:52,540

so stop talking to me

321
00:12:52,541 --> 00:12:54,469

was Henry Gerard.

325
00:13:07,724 --> 00:13:09,121
It was an anonymous email.

326
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:11,292
- No way. How would he even know
that you're not a lawyer?

327
00:13:11,293 --> 00:13:13,691
- That case we took last year,
he figured it out.

328
00:13:13,693 --> 00:13:15,531
- Well, then why would he wait
to turn you in now?

329
00:13:15,532 --> 00:13:16,929
- I don't know,
but what I do know is,

330
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:18,960
you need to get up there and you
need to get him to take it back.

331
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:20,425
- How the hell am I
supposed to do that?

332
00:13:20,433 --> 00:13:21,903
- That's what you and I are
gonna figure out right now.

333
00:13:21,904 --> 00:13:23,902
- Wait a second.
Where's Harvey?

334
00:13:23,904 --> 00:13:25,638
- He's got an important
meeting that...

335

- What could be
more important than this?

336
00:13:26,808 --> 00:13:27,807
- Louis,
it's a personal matter...

337
00:13:27,808 --> 00:13:30,776
- Where is he?

338
00:13:30,777 --> 00:13:32,377

what I was afraid of.

340
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,210
I'm heading down there
right now.

341

listen to me.

343
00:13:38,218 --> 00:13:39,548

and the best way

344
00:13:39,553 --> 00:13:42,123
to make that pressure go away
is to make Gerard go away,

345
00:13:42,124 --> 00:13:45,222
which can make this whole case
go away.

346
00:13:45,225 --> 00:13:46,755
- Give me the goddamn email.

347
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:53,725
- Now, before you go up there,
we're gonna...

348
00:13:53,733 --> 00:13:55,233
- I'm sorry.
Wait a second.

349
00:13:55,235 --> 00:13:57,135
Why would someone who knows
you're guilty

350
00:13:57,137 --> 00:13:58,867
call you a "potential" fraud?

351
00:13:58,872 --> 00:14:00,102
- I-I don't know.

352
00:14:00,106 --> 00:14:01,406
He's trying
to cover his ass somehow.

353
00:14:01,408 --> 00:14:04,508
- "A potential fraud besmirching
the sacrosanct name

354
00:14:04,511 --> 00:14:06,011
of hallowed
Harvard University"...

355
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:09,082
- Louis, we really don't
have time for this. Please.

356
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:12,220
- Mike, I know who wrote
this email.

357
00:14:14,721 --> 00:14:17,991
It's not Henry Gerard.

358
00:14:20,827 --> 00:14:22,257
- Excuse me, miss.

359
00:14:22,262 --> 00:14:24,402
Are you alone, or can
an old man pull up a seat?

360
00:14:24,403 --> 00:14:25,957
[both chuckle]

361
00:14:25,966 --> 00:14:28,026
- Hi, Dad.
Oh.

362
00:14:28,969 --> 00:14:32,699
- So have you
looked over the deal?

363
00:14:32,706 --> 00:14:33,866
- I have.

364
00:14:33,874 --> 00:14:35,814
- And you see the potential
I'm talking about?

365
00:14:35,815 --> 00:14:38,177
- It's a great project.

366
00:14:38,178 --> 00:14:41,508
- But?
- [sighs]

367
00:14:41,514 --> 00:14:42,614
I'm not sure how wise it is

368
00:14:42,616 --> 00:14:45,046
for you to get
back into development.

369
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:46,519
- I understand you would
feel that way

370
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:47,787
after what it did to you, but...

371
00:14:47,788 --> 00:14:49,687
- I feel that way
because of what it did to you.

372
00:14:49,689 --> 00:14:50,989
- Donna, I told you.

373
00:14:50,991 --> 00:14:53,761
The banks are crazy for
this kind of thing right now.

374
00:14:53,762 --> 00:14:55,590
All I need is $250,000.

375
00:14:55,595 --> 00:14:57,295
I can get a loan
five times the size.

376
00:14:57,297 --> 00:14:59,097
- I don't know; that just
sounds really risky.

377
00:14:59,099 --> 00:15:00,929
- Aren't you always telling me
that Harvey says

378
00:15:00,934 --> 00:15:03,774
if you want to get ahead,
you need to take risks?

379
00:15:03,775 --> 00:15:07,270
- That's why you came to me.

380
00:15:07,274 --> 00:15:09,714
You're not looking for my money;
you're looking for Harvey's.

381
00:15:09,715 --> 00:15:11,477
- It would just be
to secure the loan.

382
00:15:11,478 --> 00:15:13,078
After the bank gives me
the money, he's free and clear.

383
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:14,479
- Harvey's never gonna
go for that.

384
00:15:14,481 --> 00:15:16,048
I mean, even I know
that's not legal.

385
00:15:16,049 --> 00:15:18,019
- Donna, people do
this kind of thing all the time.

386
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:20,048
It's a sleight of hand,
nothing more.

387
00:15:20,053 --> 00:15:24,056
- Dad, you're doing fine.

388
00:15:24,057 --> 00:15:25,957
Do you really need to risk
everything again?

389
00:15:25,959 --> 00:15:29,359
- Donna, I manage
a real estate office.

390
00:15:29,362 --> 00:15:34,232
Everybody there makes more.
Everybody there is doing better.

391
00:15:34,234 --> 00:15:36,434
I used to be better.

392
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:37,966
I know I can do this.

393
00:15:37,971 --> 00:15:41,040
Please, all you have to do
is ask Harvey.

394
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:43,071
If he says no, he says no.

395
00:15:45,879 --> 00:15:49,148
- Dad, I'm so sorry.

396
00:15:49,149 --> 00:15:51,079
- Don't worry, sweetie.

397
00:15:51,084 --> 00:15:53,222
People have tried to rattle
my cage plenty of times.

398
00:15:53,223 --> 00:15:56,288
It's never worked before,
and it's not gonna work now.

399
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:58,819
- That's what I told her.
You're gonna be okay.

400
00:15:58,825 --> 00:16:01,255
Donna, can you give us a minute?

401
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:06,063
- Harvey...

402
00:16:06,066 --> 00:16:07,526
- Yeah?

403
00:16:07,534 --> 00:16:09,072
- They're saying
this has to do with that deal

404
00:16:09,073 --> 00:16:10,499
I talked to you about
seven years ago.

405
00:16:10,503 --> 00:16:11,603
- And?

406
00:16:11,604 --> 00:16:13,539
- Is there something
you're not telling me?

407
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:14,970
- The only thing
I haven't told you

408
00:16:14,975 --> 00:16:17,105
is that I'm gonna get him
out of this, no matter what.

409
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:27,688
What the hell did you do?

410
00:16:27,689 --> 00:16:29,117
- What are you talking about?

411
00:16:29,122 --> 00:16:30,860
- They didn't bring you in here
if you didn't do something

412
00:16:30,861 --> 00:16:32,517
seven years ago, and if
I'm gonna get you out of this,

413
00:16:32,525 --> 00:16:33,955
I need to know what you did.

414
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,990
- I did what everybody else did.

415
00:16:35,996 --> 00:16:38,356
I inflated my collateral
because you shut me down,

416
00:16:38,365 --> 00:16:40,525
so don't come in here telling me
this is my fault.

417
00:16:40,533 --> 00:16:42,233
- I shut you down
to protect Donna

418
00:16:42,235 --> 00:16:44,795
from getting involved
in exactly something like this.

419
00:16:44,804 --> 00:16:46,304
This is on you, not on me.

420
00:16:46,306 --> 00:16:49,136
- Well, aren't you
high and mighty,

421
00:16:49,142 --> 00:16:51,842
coming in here accusing me
of putting my daughter at risk

422
00:16:51,845 --> 00:16:54,175
when the whole reason
she's in the position she's in

423
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:56,648
is because of something you did?

424
00:16:56,649 --> 00:16:57,879
That's right.

425
00:16:57,884 --> 00:16:59,284
They told me this is
because they're trying

426
00:16:59,285 --> 00:17:01,445
to get Donna to testify
against you,

427
00:17:01,454 --> 00:17:03,624
and they want me to help them
get her to do it.

428
00:17:03,625 --> 00:17:05,223
- Then why don't you?

429
00:17:05,225 --> 00:17:07,155
- Because I know
it would kill her,

430
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,528
and no matter what
you may think,

431
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:12,029
I would never do anything
to hurt my daughter.

432
00:17:16,102 --> 00:17:17,571
- Did you talk to Donna?

433
00:17:17,572 --> 00:17:19,738
- I talked to Harvey, and
he said it's gonna be f...

434
00:17:19,739 --> 00:17:20,739
- I don't care what he says.

435
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:21,740
What are they
coming after her for?

436
00:17:21,741 --> 00:17:22,841
- Mike, Harvey asked me
not to...

437
00:17:22,842 --> 00:17:24,610
- Rachel, what are they
coming after her for?

438
00:17:24,611 --> 00:17:26,281
- They're not coming after her
for anything.

439
00:17:26,282 --> 00:17:27,649
They're coming after her father.

440
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:29,047
- What?

441
00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:30,549
- Turns out he was involved
in some sort of real estate deal

442
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:31,680
and they're saying it wasn't
on the up-and-up.

443
00:17:31,684 --> 00:17:32,751
- Goddamn it!

444
00:17:32,752 --> 00:17:35,087
- Mike, calm down.
It's nothing.

445
00:17:35,088 --> 00:17:36,618
Harvey's gonna get them
out of it.

446
00:17:36,623 --> 00:17:39,061
Look, it's really
just a minor violation,

447
00:17:39,062 --> 00:17:41,489
and no one would even care
if it weren't for...

448
00:17:42,829 --> 00:17:44,997
- Me. You were just about to say
if it weren't for me.

449
00:17:44,998 --> 00:17:45,998
- Mike, I...
- That's it.

450
00:17:45,999 --> 00:17:47,129
I'm pleading guilty.

451
00:17:47,133 --> 00:17:48,301
I'm gonna take
the reduced sentence,

452
00:17:48,302 --> 00:17:49,301
I'm gonna do the time,
and all of this

453
00:17:49,302 --> 00:17:50,602
is gonna go away
once and for all.

454
00:17:50,603 --> 00:17:52,473
- That's not an option,
and you know it.

455
00:17:52,474 --> 00:17:54,442
The only reason
they went after Donna's dad

456
00:17:54,443 --> 00:17:55,971
is to get to Harvey and Jessica.

457
00:17:55,975 --> 00:17:58,535
If you plead guilty, all you're
gonna do is help them do that,

458
00:17:58,545 --> 00:18:00,605
so you're either gonna
turn on the two of them

459
00:18:00,613 --> 00:18:03,582
or you're gonna fight this thing
out till the end.

460
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,050
- We need to talk.

461
00:18:05,051 --> 00:18:06,081
- About what?

462
00:18:06,086 --> 00:18:07,286
- About what we're going to do

463
00:18:07,287 --> 00:18:09,447
if that prosecutor
gets ahold of those subpoenas.

464
00:18:09,456 --> 00:18:11,856
- You mean what we're gonna do
about the letter that Mike has

465
00:18:11,858 --> 00:18:13,458
that proves you knew
he was a fraud.

466
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:15,990
- Yes, that's what I mean.

467
00:18:15,995 --> 00:18:17,425
I'm assuming you were
smart enough

468
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:19,230
to destroy that thing
the second they let you out.

469
00:18:19,232 --> 00:18:20,872
- And I'm assuming you
destroyed the affidavit

470
00:18:20,873 --> 00:18:23,867
that you had Rachel sign saying
she knew the truth about me.

471
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:25,670
- I didn't,

472
00:18:25,672 --> 00:18:28,042
but I had the same conversation
with Louis, we worked it out,

473
00:18:28,043 --> 00:18:29,141
and I'm here to tell you

474
00:18:29,142 --> 00:18:31,312
I will get rid of mine
if you get rid of yours.

475
00:18:32,812 --> 00:18:34,782
I knew it;
you're actually considering

476
00:18:34,783 --> 00:18:36,481
turning your back
on me and Harvey.

477
00:18:36,483 --> 00:18:37,951
- I'm not turning my back
on anyone,

478
00:18:37,952 --> 00:18:39,521
but we both know
you've done some things

479
00:18:39,522 --> 00:18:42,049
that make me question
whether or not I can trust you.

480
00:18:42,055 --> 00:18:44,585
- Well, then,
the least you can do

481
00:18:44,591 --> 00:18:47,061
is find the time to speak
with my attorney

482
00:18:47,062 --> 00:18:48,730
before that ruling comes down.

483
00:18:48,731 --> 00:18:49,828
- Your attorney?

484
00:18:49,829 --> 00:18:51,829
- I'm sure you've heard of him.

485
00:18:51,831 --> 00:18:54,731
His name's Jeff Malone.

486
00:18:57,537 --> 00:18:59,537
- You're even lower
than I thought you were,

487
00:18:59,539 --> 00:19:01,239
and I didn't even think
that was possible.

488
00:19:01,241 --> 00:19:02,711
- Coming from someone
with your moral compass,

489
00:19:02,712 --> 00:19:03,939
I take that as a compliment.

490
00:19:03,943 --> 00:19:04,983
- What gives you the right

491
00:19:04,984 --> 00:19:06,578
to come after
my secretary's father?

492
00:19:06,579 --> 00:19:07,709
- I'm not the one
prosecuting him.

493
00:19:07,714 --> 00:19:09,254
It just so happens that
one of my colleagues

494
00:19:09,255 --> 00:19:11,749
is going after him on
a completely unrelated matter.

495
00:19:11,751 --> 00:19:13,551
- Bullshit, the only reason
you're doing this

496
00:19:13,553 --> 00:19:15,891
is to put pressure on Donna
to come after me.

497
00:19:15,892 --> 00:19:18,219
- Well, now that you mention it,
the judge did say

498
00:19:18,224 --> 00:19:20,731
I needed something tying you
to Mike Ross's fraud

499
00:19:20,732 --> 00:19:22,127
in order to get those subpoenas,

500
00:19:22,128 --> 00:19:24,058
and maybe that something
is Donna Paulsen.

501
00:19:24,063 --> 00:19:25,063
I should ask her.

502
00:19:25,064 --> 00:19:26,202
- You already did ask her,

503
00:19:26,203 --> 00:19:27,429
and now you're manufacturing

504
00:19:27,433 --> 00:19:29,533
a bullshit case
against an innocent man,

505
00:19:29,536 --> 00:19:31,436
and I'm gonna make sure
you pay for it.

506
00:19:31,437 --> 00:19:33,297
- He's not in here
because of what I did.

507
00:19:33,306 --> 00:19:35,206
He's in here
because of what you did.

508
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:37,738
So instead of blaming me,
take a look in the mirror,

509
00:19:37,744 --> 00:19:40,682
'cause all you have to do
is admit what you did,

510
00:19:40,683 --> 00:19:42,450
and all of this goes away.

I got a call about an article

on Mike Ross's meteoric rise
to junior partner.

525
00:20:25,661 --> 00:20:26,888
Problem is, I remember

every student
that's ever gone here,

527
00:20:29,034 --> 00:20:31,496

528
00:20:31,497 --> 00:20:34,866
so I double-checked
my file room,

529
00:20:34,867 --> 00:20:36,127
and then I sent this.

530
00:20:36,135 --> 00:20:38,195
- Sheila, you are
messing with my firm.

531
00:20:38,204 --> 00:20:39,938
Why didn't you come to me first?

532
00:20:39,939 --> 00:20:41,669

that I had to.

You didn't trust me
to keep you out of it.

537
00:20:49,151 --> 00:20:50,718
- No, I reported it anonymously

538
00:20:50,719 --> 00:20:53,547
because I was ashamed that
it happened on my watch,

539
00:20:53,553 --> 00:20:56,153

I forced myself to accept it,

we wanted different things,

knew that we were soul mates.

- No, they're not gonna
find her,

633

from a general faculty email

I won't let you help,

from our work on your case.

684
00:26:38,301 --> 00:26:39,957
And I knew I had to find you
at a place

685
00:26:39,966 --> 00:26:42,126
where we couldn't be bothered
by anyone from Harvard.

686
00:26:42,134 --> 00:26:44,572
- Because everyone from Harvard
now knows you didn't go there.

687
00:26:44,573 --> 00:26:46,040
- Which is why I need
someone from Harvard

688
00:26:46,041 --> 00:26:47,238
to tell them that I did.

689
00:26:47,239 --> 00:26:48,469
- Are you crazy?

690
00:26:48,474 --> 00:26:49,774
- No, I'm smart.

691
00:26:49,775 --> 00:26:51,335
All they have is
an anonymous tip

692
00:26:51,344 --> 00:26:52,744
and no corroborating evidence.

693
00:26:52,745 --> 00:26:55,305
You sign this affidavit saying
that I was in your class,

694
00:26:55,314 --> 00:26:56,714
their whole case gets dismissed.

695
00:26:56,716 --> 00:26:57,746
- And what if it doesn't?

696
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:59,250
- Then I go to trial.

697
00:26:59,251 --> 00:27:00,418
This is reasonable doubt.

698
00:27:00,419 --> 00:27:02,189
I get acquitted,
they can never try me again.

699
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:04,818
- Or it's not reasonable doubt,
you don't get acquitted,

700
00:27:04,824 --> 00:27:06,224
and I go to jail for perjury.

701
00:27:06,225 --> 00:27:08,025
- I remember when you were
willing to commit perjury

702
00:27:08,027 --> 00:27:10,327
and we didn't just stop you;
we saved your ass.

703
00:27:10,329 --> 00:27:13,159
- I don't care. I'm not
risking everything for you.

704
00:27:13,165 --> 00:27:15,665
- This isn't just for me,
all right?

705
00:27:15,668 --> 00:27:18,768
They are coming after everyone
that I care about.

706
00:27:18,771 --> 00:27:21,006
- I feel for you, Mike,

707
00:27:21,007 --> 00:27:23,037
which is why I never turned
you in in the first place,

708
00:27:23,042 --> 00:27:25,710
but I can't do
what you're asking.

709
00:27:25,711 --> 00:27:27,281
- And what if I
anonymously told Harvard

710
00:27:27,282 --> 00:27:31,179
that you took a bribe
from a student for a grade?

711
00:27:31,183 --> 00:27:33,223
You willing to bet everything
that I won't do that?

712
00:27:33,224 --> 00:27:35,186
- You do what you have to do,

713
00:27:35,187 --> 00:27:36,747
but I'm not putting
my life in jeopardy

714
00:27:36,756 --> 00:27:38,586
by signing that goddamn thing.

715
00:27:40,493 --> 00:27:43,461
- Wait a minute, wait, wait.

716
00:27:43,462 --> 00:27:45,002
What if I had a way
that you could help me

717
00:27:45,003 --> 00:27:46,457
without having to
perjure yourself?

718
00:27:46,465 --> 00:27:48,425
- And how exactly
would I do that?

719
00:27:48,434 --> 00:27:49,903
- It's right in your wheelhouse.

720
00:27:49,904 --> 00:27:51,442
We're playing poker too.

721
00:27:51,443 --> 00:27:54,037
I just...

722
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:56,070
I just need you
to help me bluff.

723
00:27:58,644 --> 00:28:01,980
- Harvey, I need to ask you
to do something.

724
00:28:01,981 --> 00:28:03,711
- Of course, Donna.
I'd do anything for you.

725
00:28:03,716 --> 00:28:06,576
- Well, it isn't for me.
It's for my father.

726
00:28:06,585 --> 00:28:08,745
He wanted to know
if you would consider

727
00:28:08,754 --> 00:28:12,257
investing
in his real estate project.

728
00:28:12,258 --> 00:28:13,418
- I'm sorry.
I can't do that.

729
00:28:13,426 --> 00:28:14,956
- You just said that you would
do anything for me.

730
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:18,830
- I meant I'd consider anything,
and I just did.

731
00:28:18,831 --> 00:28:20,361
- You haven't even looked at it.

732
00:28:20,366 --> 00:28:22,596
- I don't need to.

733
00:28:22,601 --> 00:28:24,739
You're family to me,
he's family to you,

734
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:26,967
and you don't invest money
with family.

735
00:28:26,972 --> 00:28:28,039
- That's not what you said

736
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,370
when Marcus needed money
for his restaurant.

737
00:28:29,375 --> 00:28:31,035
- That's different.
- Why?

738
00:28:31,043 --> 00:28:33,324
- Because Marcus actually knew
what the hell he was doing.

739
00:28:35,414 --> 00:28:36,614
- You know what, Harvey?

740
00:28:36,615 --> 00:28:38,215
If you don't want to invest,
don't invest,

741
00:28:38,217 --> 00:28:39,717
but I don't need
a lecture from you

742
00:28:39,719 --> 00:28:42,689
on what a bad businessman
my father is.

743
00:28:43,956 --> 00:28:45,056
- Yes, you do.

744
00:28:45,057 --> 00:28:46,117
- Oh, really?
Why's that?

745
00:28:46,125 --> 00:28:47,555
- Because if I know you,

746
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,790
you're thinking of giving him
access to your 401(k).

747
00:28:49,795 --> 00:28:51,125
- So? What if I am?

748
00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:53,898
- Donna, this man lost
your family's money once.

749
00:28:53,899 --> 00:28:55,529
You're gonna give him
the chance to do it again?

750
00:28:55,534 --> 00:28:57,802
- Harvey, this man is my father,

751
00:28:57,803 --> 00:28:59,841
and he has been there for me
my whole life.

752
00:28:59,842 --> 00:29:02,039
And I know what happened
between you and your mother,

753
00:29:02,041 --> 00:29:03,971
but don't you judge him
for what she did.

754
00:29:03,976 --> 00:29:06,436
How dare you? This has
nothing to do with that.

755
00:29:06,445 --> 00:29:08,205
You have a blind spot
when it comes to him.

756
00:29:08,214 --> 00:29:09,414
I'm trying to protect you.

757
00:29:09,415 --> 00:29:12,445
- Well, you're not.
You're being an asshole.

758
00:29:12,451 --> 00:29:14,851
And for your information,
keeping me from being there

759
00:29:14,854 --> 00:29:16,754
for my father
isn't protecting me.

760
00:29:16,756 --> 00:29:19,156
It's pissing me the hell off.

761
00:29:26,332 --> 00:29:28,502
- Good, Donna, you're here.
Look, I need you to...

762
00:29:28,503 --> 00:29:31,536
- The only thing I need is
for you to tell me what you did,

763
00:29:31,537 --> 00:29:32,767
because I just found out
that they're

764
00:29:32,772 --> 00:29:34,942
formally charging my father
with bank fraud tomorrow.

765
00:29:34,943 --> 00:29:36,840
- Goddamn it.

766
00:29:36,842 --> 00:29:38,142
- What did you do?

767
00:29:38,144 --> 00:29:40,211
- All I did was
strong-arm a banker.

768
00:29:40,212 --> 00:29:42,382
- And why the hell would you
need to strong-arm a banker?

769
00:29:42,383 --> 00:29:44,619
- Because he had evidence
that needed to get lost.

770
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:47,577
- I knew there was something
you weren't telling me.

771
00:29:47,586 --> 00:29:49,586
What the hell happened
seven years ago?

772
00:29:49,588 --> 00:29:50,918
- What happened is,
you came to me

773
00:29:50,923 --> 00:29:53,323
asking a favor for your father,
so I went to him

774
00:29:53,325 --> 00:29:54,785
asking a favor of my own.

775
00:29:54,794 --> 00:29:56,832
- Bullshit.
You don't ask people for favors.

776
00:29:56,833 --> 00:29:58,459
You force them to do things!

777
00:29:58,464 --> 00:29:59,701
- You're goddamn right I do.

778
00:29:59,702 --> 00:30:01,668
I told your father
if he took your money,

779
00:30:01,669 --> 00:30:04,227
I'd pull every string I have
to shut his deal down.

780
00:30:05,404 --> 00:30:07,104
- You had no right to do that.

781
00:30:07,106 --> 00:30:09,866
- I don't care if I had
a right to do it or not.

782
00:30:09,875 --> 00:30:11,405
I wasn't gonna let you
lose everything

783
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:13,080
just because you couldn't see
the truth about him.

784
00:30:13,081 --> 00:30:15,078
- The truth is, you went
behind my back,

785
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,510
and then he did
something illegal,

786
00:30:16,515 --> 00:30:18,915
and now I have to choose
between you and him

787
00:30:18,918 --> 00:30:20,148
because of what you did!

788
00:30:20,152 --> 00:30:21,452
- What I did was keep you

789
00:30:21,453 --> 00:30:22,853
from being involved
in this mess.

790
00:30:22,855 --> 00:30:25,755
- No, Harvey, what you did
was start this mess

791
00:30:25,758 --> 00:30:28,358
the day you went ahead
and hired a fraud.

792
00:30:37,136 --> 00:30:38,436
- What happened?

793
00:30:38,437 --> 00:30:40,297
- They're formally charging
Donna's father,

794
00:30:40,306 --> 00:30:42,606
and we need to figure out a way
to get his case thrown out.

795
00:30:42,608 --> 00:30:44,368
- Well, then we have to get
my case thrown out,

796
00:30:44,376 --> 00:30:46,806
because then they won't care
about Donna's dad.

797
00:30:46,812 --> 00:30:48,182
- And how the hell are we
gonna do that?

798
00:30:48,183 --> 00:30:49,547
- I went to see Gerard.

799
00:30:49,548 --> 00:30:51,178
- God damn it, didn't I
tell you not to do that?

800
00:30:51,183 --> 00:30:52,823
- That was before we knew
he wasn't the one

801
00:30:52,824 --> 00:30:54,148
that tipped them off.

802
00:30:54,153 --> 00:30:56,391
- If he wasn't the one
who tipped them off,

803
00:30:56,392 --> 00:30:58,718
what the hell
did you go to him for?

804
00:30:58,724 --> 00:31:00,424
- I went to him for this.

805
00:31:05,965 --> 00:31:08,295
- This is a vaguely worded
statement.

806
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:10,570
It doesn't even specifically say
you went to Harvard.

807
00:31:10,571 --> 00:31:11,869
- It doesn't have to.

808
00:31:11,871 --> 00:31:13,801
It says that he's known me
to be an amazing lawyer,

809
00:31:13,806 --> 00:31:16,166
that I've shown mastery
of the material that he teaches,

810
00:31:16,175 --> 00:31:17,505
and that as far
as he's concerned,

811
00:31:17,509 --> 00:31:19,109
I'm an outstanding student
of the law.

812
00:31:19,111 --> 00:31:20,278
- It's total bullshit.

813
00:31:20,279 --> 00:31:21,747
- It's not total bullshit,
all right?

814
00:31:21,748 --> 00:31:23,307
If they don't find Sheila
and we do this,

815
00:31:23,315 --> 00:31:24,645
we could get
the whole case thrown out.

816
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:26,280
- Gibbs'll see
right through this.

817
00:31:26,285 --> 00:31:29,445
She'll put Gerard on the stand,
and she'll ask him point blank

818
00:31:29,455 --> 00:31:31,855
if he knows for a fact
that you never went to Harvard,

819
00:31:31,857 --> 00:31:33,617
and we'll have signed
our own death warrant.

820
00:31:33,626 --> 00:31:35,086
- She's not gonna do that,
because it violates

821
00:31:35,094 --> 00:31:37,494
the number one rule of being
a lawyer that you taught me:

822
00:31:37,496 --> 00:31:39,456
don't ask a question that
you don't have the answer to.

823
00:31:39,465 --> 00:31:40,595
- It's too big a risk.

824
00:31:40,599 --> 00:31:42,269
- Harvey, Donna's dad
is at risk,

825
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:43,998
and he's at risk because of me.

826
00:31:44,003 --> 00:31:46,071
The only way to get him out
is to have me to turn on you

827
00:31:46,072 --> 00:31:47,771
or for us to get
this whole thing thrown out,

828
00:31:47,773 --> 00:31:50,473
so are you on board
with this or not?

829
00:31:50,476 --> 00:31:52,376
- We better pray
this bullshit works,

830
00:31:52,378 --> 00:31:54,138
because, if it doesn't,
at least one of us

831
00:31:54,146 --> 00:31:56,606
is gonna end up
in prison tomorrow.

832
00:31:56,615 --> 00:31:59,615
- All right,
what are we doing here?

833
00:31:59,618 --> 00:32:03,318
- Your Honor, we have a motion
to dismiss Mike Ross's case.

834
00:32:03,322 --> 00:32:04,422
- On what grounds?

835
00:32:04,423 --> 00:32:05,993
- On the grounds that
I have a letter here

836
00:32:05,994 --> 00:32:09,227
from Professor Henry Gerard
of Harvard Law

837
00:32:09,228 --> 00:32:11,158
saying that Mike Ross
was in his class.

838
00:32:11,163 --> 00:32:12,332
- This is ridiculous.

839
00:32:12,333 --> 00:32:14,061
Even if Mr. Ross
were in that class,

840
00:32:14,066 --> 00:32:15,796
it doesn't mean
he was matriculated.

841
00:32:15,801 --> 00:32:18,339
- You still haven't shown
any evidence that he wasn't,

842
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:21,267
which is why that document
should get this case dismissed.

843
00:32:21,273 --> 00:32:22,740
- This document is

844
00:32:22,741 --> 00:32:24,208
a cryptically worded
piece of shit,

845
00:32:24,209 --> 00:32:25,539
and you're a man
who has a reputation

846
00:32:25,544 --> 00:32:26,613
for crossing the line.

847
00:32:26,614 --> 00:32:29,412
- Ms. Gibbs, language.
What are you implying?

848
00:32:29,415 --> 00:32:31,105
- Your Honor,
there's a good chance

849
00:32:31,116 --> 00:32:34,746
he coerced this Professor Gerard
into signing this thing.

850
00:32:34,753 --> 00:32:37,123
- So our exhibits are
all from blackmail,

851
00:32:37,124 --> 00:32:39,560
but yours are squeaky clean
because you're Mother Teresa?

852
00:32:39,561 --> 00:32:40,918
- I may not be Mother Teresa,

853
00:32:40,926 --> 00:32:42,956
but I don't resort to coercion
to get my evidence.

854
00:32:42,962 --> 00:32:44,062
- Then what exactly
are you doing

855
00:32:44,063 --> 00:32:45,263
with Donna Paulsen's father?

856
00:32:45,264 --> 00:32:46,864
- Care to tell me
what he's talking about?

857
00:32:46,865 --> 00:32:48,765
- I'll tell you.
She fabricated a charge

858
00:32:48,767 --> 00:32:52,197
against an innocent businessman
to pressure my secretary

859
00:32:52,204 --> 00:32:54,474
into giving false testimony
against me.

860
00:32:54,475 --> 00:32:55,973
- Your Honor,
it's standard practice

861
00:32:55,975 --> 00:32:58,275
to find leverage
against a vital witness.

862
00:32:58,277 --> 00:32:59,677
- Oh, is it also standard
practice to have

863
00:32:59,678 --> 00:33:02,108
a federal marshal rough me up
in a holding cell?

864
00:33:02,114 --> 00:33:05,621
- Ms. Gibbs, if I find out
there's an abuse of power here,

865
00:33:05,622 --> 00:33:07,647
I will be switching
my focus to you.

866
00:33:07,653 --> 00:33:09,891
- Then before you rule
on their motion,

867
00:33:09,892 --> 00:33:11,048
the state has the right

868
00:33:11,056 --> 00:33:13,416
to question
this Professor Gerard.

869
00:33:15,961 --> 00:33:18,501
- Your Honor, can Ms. Gibbs
and I have a minute alone?

870
00:33:18,502 --> 00:33:20,927
- Please.

871
00:33:20,933 --> 00:33:23,833
- You think I don't know this
letter is complete bullshit?

872
00:33:23,836 --> 00:33:25,296
I pull this clown
up on the stand,

873
00:33:25,304 --> 00:33:26,874
he's gonna tell me
the truth in a minute.

874
00:33:26,875 --> 00:33:28,441
- Okay, this clown is one of

875
00:33:28,442 --> 00:33:31,209
the most distinguished ethics
professors in the country.

876
00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:33,240
You put him up there,
this case is over for you

877
00:33:33,245 --> 00:33:34,505
before you even get started.

878
00:33:34,513 --> 00:33:36,113
- Then why the hell
isn't he here right now

879
00:33:36,115 --> 00:33:37,275
verifying this thing?

880
00:33:37,282 --> 00:33:39,282
- Because that kid cares
more about Donna Paulsen

881
00:33:39,284 --> 00:33:40,654
than he does about himself.

882
00:33:40,655 --> 00:33:42,020
- What do you want?

883
00:33:42,021 --> 00:33:44,761
- I want to make a deal...
That letter for Donna's father.

884
00:33:44,762 --> 00:33:46,417
- [scoffs]

885
00:33:46,425 --> 00:33:47,755
This is too good for you.

886
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:51,260
If you really had Gerard,
he'd be down here right now.

887
00:33:51,263 --> 00:33:53,763
- If it were up to me,
he'd be down here right now,

888
00:33:53,766 --> 00:33:55,496
but this is Mike's call.

889
00:33:55,501 --> 00:33:58,301
This is a one-time offer,
and the clock's ticking.

890
00:33:58,303 --> 00:33:59,841
You still get to go to trial,

891
00:33:59,842 --> 00:34:01,968
we get Donna and her father
off limits,

892
00:34:01,974 --> 00:34:03,974
and we both live
to fight another day.

893
00:34:03,976 --> 00:34:05,676
- I want my subpoenas too.

894
00:34:05,677 --> 00:34:07,407
- No way.
Judge said no.

895
00:34:09,348 --> 00:34:11,418
- You try to pull this thing
out at trial,

896
00:34:11,419 --> 00:34:14,077
I will rip your professor friend
to shreds.

897
00:34:17,322 --> 00:34:21,159
- Your Honor, Ms. Gibbs and I
have come to an agreement.

898
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:23,790
She's dropping all charges
against James Paulsen,

899
00:34:23,796 --> 00:34:25,996
and we withdraw
our motion to dismiss.

900
00:34:30,769 --> 00:34:30,999
.

901
00:34:31,003 --> 00:34:33,838
- See you next week.

902
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:34,969
- Nice club.

903
00:34:34,973 --> 00:34:36,073
- Are you new?

904
00:34:36,075 --> 00:34:37,905
- Just visiting.
Not much of a golfer.

905
00:34:37,910 --> 00:34:40,240
- Unfortunately, neither am I.

906
00:34:40,245 --> 00:34:41,575
- Harvey Specter.

907
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:42,947
- Jim Paulsen.

908
00:34:42,948 --> 00:34:44,508
I assume this is
about the opportunity

909
00:34:44,516 --> 00:34:45,946
Donna brought you.

910
00:34:45,951 --> 00:34:47,581
- It'd be an opportunity
if the numbers added up, Jim,

911
00:34:47,586 --> 00:34:48,846
but they don't.

912
00:34:48,854 --> 00:34:50,621
- I don't understand.

913
00:34:50,622 --> 00:34:51,862
I thought you were
the type of man

914
00:34:51,863 --> 00:34:53,217
that was willing to take risks.

915
00:34:53,225 --> 00:34:56,525
- I am... but not if it puts
people I care about in jeopardy,

916
00:34:56,528 --> 00:34:57,888
which is why I'm here
to tell you

917
00:34:57,896 --> 00:35:00,196
that when Donna
offers you her 401(k),

918
00:35:00,199 --> 00:35:01,769
you're gonna tell her
you don't need it anymore.

919
00:35:01,770 --> 00:35:04,467
- No offense, Mr. Specter,
but what my daughter does

920
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:06,300
with her money is
none of your business.

921
00:35:06,305 --> 00:35:08,565
- Well, it became my business
when Donna put you

922
00:35:08,574 --> 00:35:10,844
so far up on a pedestal
that she couldn't smell

923
00:35:10,845 --> 00:35:12,343
the bullshit
you were dishing out.

924
00:35:12,344 --> 00:35:13,844
- It's not bullshit.

925
00:35:13,846 --> 00:35:15,376
- Yes, it is.
I looked at that deal.

926
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:17,180
There's no way you're getting
the kind of money you need

927
00:35:17,182 --> 00:35:18,720
without doing something shady.

928
00:35:18,721 --> 00:35:21,617
- Inflating my assets
to get a loan isn't shady.

929
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:23,050
Everybody does it.

930
00:35:23,055 --> 00:35:25,755
- That's what everybody thinks
until the music stops,

931
00:35:25,757 --> 00:35:27,987
which is why if you involve
Donna in this deal,

932
00:35:27,993 --> 00:35:30,163
so help me God, I will pull
every string I have

933
00:35:30,164 --> 00:35:34,332
to tie your project up in court
for the next 20 years.

934
00:35:34,333 --> 00:35:36,103
- I'm just trying
to make my way.

935
00:35:36,104 --> 00:35:39,971
- All I'm telling you is,
you can make it without Donna.

936
00:35:39,972 --> 00:35:44,308
- You act as if you think
I don't love my own daughter.

937
00:35:44,309 --> 00:35:46,577
- People who love other people

938
00:35:46,578 --> 00:35:49,648
don't put them in positions
to break the law.

939
00:35:52,384 --> 00:35:55,786
[footsteps approaching]

940
00:35:55,787 --> 00:35:57,747
- I just got off the phone
with my dad.

941
00:35:57,756 --> 00:35:59,156
He told me the good news.

942
00:35:59,158 --> 00:36:00,918
- I told you
I'd take care of it.

943
00:36:00,926 --> 00:36:02,486
- What did you do?

944
00:36:02,494 --> 00:36:03,734
- It's not important.

945
00:36:03,735 --> 00:36:04,996
- Harvey.

946
00:36:04,997 --> 00:36:07,597
- We withdrew our motion
to dismiss Mike's case

947
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:09,769
in exchange for her
leaving you alone.

948
00:36:09,770 --> 00:36:11,228
- So I hurt Mike's case.

949
00:36:11,236 --> 00:36:12,466
- No, you didn't.

950
00:36:12,471 --> 00:36:14,340
The whole thing was based
on a bluff

951
00:36:14,341 --> 00:36:16,639
that never would have
held up anyway.

952
00:36:16,642 --> 00:36:18,542
[sighs]

953
00:36:18,544 --> 00:36:21,184
This way, we at least got
something for it.

954
00:36:21,185 --> 00:36:23,250
- Thank you, Harvey.

955
00:36:25,083 --> 00:36:27,518
And I'm sorry for what I said.

956
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:29,049
- No.

957
00:36:29,054 --> 00:36:31,589
You were right to say it.

958
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:34,890
I never should have put you
in this position, Donna.

959
00:36:34,893 --> 00:36:37,428
If you want to go back to work
for Louis, I'll understand.

960
00:36:37,429 --> 00:36:39,329
- No, you shouldn't have put me
in that position,

961
00:36:39,331 --> 00:36:41,161
but if I was gonna leave you
for hiring Mike,

962
00:36:41,166 --> 00:36:44,426
the time to do that
would have been years ago.

963
00:36:46,071 --> 00:36:48,841
- I hope I'm not interrupting
your premature celebration.

964
00:36:48,842 --> 00:36:50,840
- You better not be
reneging on our deal.

965
00:36:50,842 --> 00:36:52,212
- Oh, no, I'm gonna honor it.

966
00:36:52,213 --> 00:36:55,580
I just dropped by
to serve you with these.

967
00:36:55,581 --> 00:36:58,221
You and your partners are
hereby subpoenaed

968
00:36:58,222 --> 00:37:02,217
to hand over every single
document in the entire firm.

969
00:37:02,221 --> 00:37:03,221
- No.

970
00:37:03,222 --> 00:37:04,652
No way the judge granted that

971
00:37:04,656 --> 00:37:07,216
just because we withdrew
our motion to dismiss.

972
00:37:07,226 --> 00:37:08,456
- She didn't.

973
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:11,490
She granted it when
a Sheila Sazs from Harvard

974
00:37:11,496 --> 00:37:15,666
came forward and said she wrote
that anonymous email.

975
00:37:15,667 --> 00:37:16,867
That's right, Mr. Specter.

976
00:37:16,868 --> 00:37:18,568
Your chances of winning
this case just took

977
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:21,640
a mighty big turn for the worse.

978
00:37:29,948 --> 00:37:31,078
- What are you doing here?

979
00:37:31,083 --> 00:37:32,123
- You never came to see me,

980
00:37:32,124 --> 00:37:33,817
so I thought I would come to you

981
00:37:33,819 --> 00:37:35,149
and find out why
you're so willing

982
00:37:35,153 --> 00:37:36,591
to let all those
dangerous letters

983
00:37:36,592 --> 00:37:38,318
just keep floating around
out there.

984
00:37:38,323 --> 00:37:40,823
- I think you mean letters that
are dangerous to your client.

985
00:37:40,826 --> 00:37:42,186
- Well, I'm holding one
right here

986
00:37:42,194 --> 00:37:44,094
that puts your woman
in a world of trouble, Mike,

987
00:37:44,096 --> 00:37:46,496
so no, no, I don't.

988
00:37:46,498 --> 00:37:48,058
- Oh, I get it.

989
00:37:48,066 --> 00:37:49,896
I didn't crumble to Jessica,
so now you're here

990
00:37:49,901 --> 00:37:52,241
to take a shot at
strong-arming me into a trade.

991
00:37:52,242 --> 00:37:54,337
- No, see, I came to see why,

992
00:37:54,339 --> 00:37:57,039
when the woman that's been
protecting you for so long

993
00:37:57,042 --> 00:37:59,977
asks you for a simple
gesture of trust,

994
00:37:59,978 --> 00:38:02,448
you seem to think that all she's
doing is protecting herself.

995
00:38:02,449 --> 00:38:04,007
- Because she is
protecting herself.

996
00:38:04,016 --> 00:38:05,746
- You're goddamn right
that's what she's doing,

997
00:38:05,751 --> 00:38:07,120
but that's not all she's doing,

998
00:38:07,121 --> 00:38:09,289
because from the second
that she found out about you,

999
00:38:09,290 --> 00:38:11,088
she's had to lie for you,

1000
00:38:11,089 --> 00:38:13,419
and she still treated you
like family,

1001
00:38:13,425 --> 00:38:15,055
and it cost her everything.

1002
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:17,530
- Give me a break. Until now,
it didn't cost her anything.

1003
00:38:17,531 --> 00:38:18,796
- You better watch yourself.

1004
00:38:18,797 --> 00:38:19,797
- What the hell are you doing?

1005
00:38:19,798 --> 00:38:22,868
- It cost her
her relationship with me!

1006
00:38:28,106 --> 00:38:31,806
You didn't know about that,
did you?

1007
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:34,140
Well, now you do.

1008
00:38:42,054 --> 00:38:45,156
- So you'll destroy that
if I give you mine?

1009
00:38:45,157 --> 00:38:48,587
- I'm an attorney.
I can't destroy evidence.

1010
00:38:48,593 --> 00:38:52,663
But you?
You can do whatever you want.

1011
00:38:54,066 --> 00:38:56,126
- You trust me to do that?

1012
00:38:57,235 --> 00:38:59,995
- [chuckles] No, Mike.

1013
00:39:00,005 --> 00:39:01,905
Jessica does.

1014
00:39:16,788 --> 00:39:18,658
- Louis, I need you to sit down.

1015
00:39:18,659 --> 00:39:20,217
- What is it?
What happened?

1016
00:39:20,225 --> 00:39:21,825
Is your father okay?
I'll go down there right now.

1017
00:39:21,827 --> 00:39:23,257
- He's fine.
Harvey took care of it.

1018
00:39:23,261 --> 00:39:24,831
- Oh, well, then I don't need
to sit down.

1019
00:39:24,832 --> 00:39:28,099
'Cause whatever it is,
if you're okay, I'll be okay.

1020
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:30,200
- Sheila came forward.

1021
00:39:30,202 --> 00:39:32,069
- What?

1022
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:35,140
- She admitted she was
the one to write the email.

1023
00:39:37,209 --> 00:39:38,509
- That's not possible.

1024
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:39,880
She promised me
she wouldn't do that.

1025
00:39:39,881 --> 00:39:42,408
- I'm sorry, Louis, but she did.

1026
00:39:47,652 --> 00:39:49,487
- I need to be alone.

1027
00:39:49,488 --> 00:39:51,288
- Louis, I don't think
this is the time for you to...

1028
00:39:51,289 --> 00:39:53,089
- I said get out.

1029
00:40:03,635 --> 00:40:04,625
- He did it?

1030
00:40:04,636 --> 00:40:05,696
- He did.

1031
00:40:05,704 --> 00:40:07,244
- What did you say to him?

1032
00:40:07,245 --> 00:40:09,907
- I told him
how much it cost you,

1033
00:40:09,908 --> 00:40:11,708
and then I did
what we talked about.

1034
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:13,980
- Well, it's a good thing
you did,

1035
00:40:13,981 --> 00:40:15,979
because those subpoenas
just came down.

1036
00:40:17,649 --> 00:40:19,279
- [sighs]

1037
00:40:21,453 --> 00:40:22,823
Jessica, I don't know
that I've ever been

1038
00:40:22,824 --> 00:40:25,790
much of a spiritual person,

1039
00:40:25,791 --> 00:40:27,821
but I would be lying
if I didn't admit

1040
00:40:27,826 --> 00:40:30,886
that sometimes I think
God has a plan.

1041
00:40:30,896 --> 00:40:32,296
- What are you saying?

1042
00:40:32,297 --> 00:40:34,257
- I'm saying that maybe
he's trying to show you

1043
00:40:34,266 --> 00:40:39,666
that there's more to life
than Pearson Specter Litt.

1044
00:40:39,671 --> 00:40:41,441
I'm not gonna be
your attorney on this one.

1045
00:40:41,442 --> 00:40:44,340
I think you can find
someone better.

1046
00:40:44,342 --> 00:40:45,976
- No.

1047
00:40:45,977 --> 00:40:48,377
I trust you, and there's no way

1048
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:50,710
I find someone
that I trust more.

1049
00:40:50,715 --> 00:40:54,045
- Then find me when
this is all over,

1050
00:40:54,052 --> 00:40:57,292
and we'll see if we can put
that trust to better use.

1051
00:41:02,127 --> 00:41:04,587
- Gretchen, whatever it is,
it can wait till tomorrow.

1052
00:41:04,596 --> 00:41:06,926
- This can't wait.

1053
00:41:06,932 --> 00:41:10,501
I want to apologize to you.

1054
00:41:10,502 --> 00:41:12,102
- For what?

1055
00:41:12,103 --> 00:41:15,510
- When Jack Soloff nominated
Mike Ross for partner,

1056
00:41:15,511 --> 00:41:17,607
I know it hurt Harvey a little,

1057
00:41:17,609 --> 00:41:20,539
because he wanted to be
the one to do it,

1058
00:41:20,545 --> 00:41:24,575
so I called the "ABA Journal"
to write an article about Mike.

1059
00:41:24,583 --> 00:41:27,323
I wanted to surprise Harvey
with it.

1060
00:41:30,021 --> 00:41:34,721
- You're saying the article
that tipped Sheila off was you?

1061
00:41:35,927 --> 00:41:38,457
- Yes.

1062
00:41:38,463 --> 00:41:40,263
- Why are you telling me this?

1063
00:41:40,265 --> 00:41:44,295
- Because I'm sorry.

1064
00:41:44,302 --> 00:41:47,071
And if anyone ever asks,
I'll deny ever saying this,

1065
00:41:47,072 --> 00:41:50,742
but... I know
you all knew.

1066
00:41:53,178 --> 00:41:54,908
And I'm with you.

1067
00:41:57,716 --> 00:41:59,546
- [sighs]

1068
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:01,621
Hey.
- Hey.

1069
00:42:04,489 --> 00:42:05,889
- What's the matter?

1070
00:42:05,891 --> 00:42:09,191
- I know I said I don't want you
to keep things from me,

1071
00:42:09,194 --> 00:42:10,664
but I don't want to keep things
from you either.

1072
00:42:10,665 --> 00:42:12,132
- What are you keeping from me?

1073
00:42:12,133 --> 00:42:14,798
- It's actually
good and bad news.

1074
00:42:14,799 --> 00:42:17,169
We had a chance to get this
whole case thrown out today,

1075
00:42:17,170 --> 00:42:20,998
and it didn't work,
but we did get Donna off,

1076
00:42:21,006 --> 00:42:24,336
and for the first time,
I actually started to believe

1077
00:42:24,342 --> 00:42:26,610
we can get out of this thing.

1078
00:42:26,611 --> 00:42:29,011
- And why were you afraid
to admit that to me?

1079
00:42:29,014 --> 00:42:33,017
- Because I didn't want to
get your hopes up.

1080
00:42:33,018 --> 00:42:35,218
And I didn't really
believe it before.

1081
00:42:40,125 --> 00:42:41,155
Yeah, what's up?

1082
00:42:41,159 --> 00:42:42,889
- Sheila Sazs came forward,

1083
00:42:42,894 --> 00:42:44,334
which means they're gonna
try and pit us all

1084
00:42:44,335 --> 00:42:47,399
against each other even more.
