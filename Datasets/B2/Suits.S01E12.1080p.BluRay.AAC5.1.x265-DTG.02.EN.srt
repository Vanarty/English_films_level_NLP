1
00:00:03,044 --> 00:00:04,336
- Okay.
- Bye.

2
00:00:06,548 --> 00:00:07,923
The least you can do
is be honest with Jenny.

3
00:00:08,049 --> 00:00:09,299
- That's what this is all about.
- Yeah.

4
00:00:09,426 --> 00:00:10,426
You always liked her.

5
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:13,595
You kept flirting with me
long after you started dating her.

6
00:00:13,722 --> 00:00:14,680
Yeah, well,
that's going to stop.

7
00:00:14,806 --> 00:00:15,889
And while you're at it,

8
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:17,850
no more running to me
for favors or asking me for help.

9
00:00:17,976 --> 00:00:19,977
How about you find yourself
some other paralegal?

10
00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:21,687
Because as far
as I'm concerned, we're done.

11
00:00:21,813 --> 00:00:22,896
You haven't even gone
to any law school.

12
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:25,357
- I'm working there.
- Oh, yeah. What, as a lawyer?

13
00:00:25,775 --> 00:00:28,485
It's a long story, okay?
But you can't tell anyone, ever.

14
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:30,904
This guy is not your friend.
He is an anchor.

15
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:32,865
He is my oldest friend.

16
00:00:32,991 --> 00:00:34,491
You were there.
What would you do?

17
00:00:34,617 --> 00:00:36,910
I'd tell them everything.
Watch Cameron go down.

18
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:39,163
Sleep like a baby
after I did it.

19
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:41,957
Harvey would never use it, and he'd kill
me if he knew I had it.

20
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:44,793
But can you use this?
To help him?

21
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:47,087
Clifford Danner.
He was 18.

22
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:48,922
I put him in jail
12 years ago.

23
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:51,050
He's innocent.
Cameron buried the evidence.

24
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:53,052
- Do you have enough to overturn?
- I don't know.

25
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:55,971
- So, what are you going to do?
- I'm going to get him out.

26
00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:02,853
Go. Go.

27
00:01:03,688 --> 00:01:07,900
9224-4930-754229.

28
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:08,859
No. That's not right.

29
00:01:08,985 --> 00:01:10,819
Right. I gave it
to you backwards.

30
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:13,197
I have to keep it
interesting for myself.

31
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:15,449
Security code.

32
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:17,826
You know I know it.
Why are you wasting our time?

33
00:01:17,952 --> 00:01:20,204
Because I want to
make you work for it.

34
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:22,748
Oh, really? Well, maybe I don't
feel like working for it.

35
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:26,502
- Okay. All right. I'll just...
- 8767. Stop.

36
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:27,961
No, no.

37
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:36,303
What are you doing?

38
00:01:37,847 --> 00:01:39,181
Showering.

39
00:01:40,975 --> 00:01:42,935
Oh, you don't trust me
being here without you.

40
00:01:43,061 --> 00:01:43,936
No. I...

41
00:01:44,562 --> 00:01:47,815
I trust you. I just... You know, I like
everything just so.

42
00:01:48,733 --> 00:01:49,775
What?

43
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:54,446
Okay. "Just so"
doesn't mean clean. It means just so.

44
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:57,199
Got you.

45
00:01:58,743 --> 00:02:00,577
- Have a good day.
- Bye.

46
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:07,292
Trevor. Jesus.

47
00:02:07,418 --> 00:02:08,752
Surprise.

48
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:10,921
- Can I come in?
- No.

49
00:02:11,047 --> 00:02:14,091
You... Well, I'm late. So, we should,
you know, grab a coffee on the way.

50
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:15,717
Well, let me just
take a piss first.

51
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:17,678
No, don't.
Trevor, stop.

52
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:19,221
Stop.

53
00:02:19,347 --> 00:02:20,973
You've got a girl
in there, don't you?

54
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:22,391
Let's go.

55
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:23,600
I'm just going
to take a peek.

56
00:02:23,726 --> 00:02:24,726
Trevor, stop it.
No, no. Stop.

57
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:26,061
Stop. It's not even funny.

58
00:02:26,187 --> 00:02:27,771
Get your hand off the knob.
Get your hand off the knob.

59
00:02:27,897 --> 00:02:28,939
We're going.
I'll buy you breakfast.

60
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:30,149
You're so serious.

61
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:32,693
- He loves you!
- Go.

62
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:39,158
I got a job. Law firm mail room,
of all places.

63
00:02:40,034 --> 00:02:41,034
Oh.

64
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:44,955
I was wondering, think I could stay with
you for a couple of days?

65
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:46,373
Uh...

66
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:49,126
I don't really know
if that's such a good idea.

67
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:51,628
You know, I could
have died that day.

68
00:02:51,754 --> 00:02:53,046
If it hadn't been for
you and your boss.

69
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,050
And I don't want to
live that life anymore. I really don't.

70
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:01,180
I don't have anybody else.

71
00:03:06,811 --> 00:03:09,938
- Okay.
- And I was thinking, you know,

72
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:12,900
maybe I'll try
and call Jenny.

73
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:17,070
Yeah. Yeah. You should.

74
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,080
What are you doing
here, Prosecutor?

75
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:32,044
I believe you're innocent.

76
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:38,091
You just find out you've only got
six months to live?

77
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:39,885
Because today isn't the day you get your
conscience cleared.

78
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:40,844
That's not the
reason that I'm...

79
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:42,763
You know, I've been
in here a dozen years.

80
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,974
While Jason Black and Matt Bailey are
out there living it up.

81
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,685
You think I give a shit
what you believe?

82
00:03:48,811 --> 00:03:51,021
- You want to hit me?
- I want to kill you.

83
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:55,859
But I lay a finger on you and they put
me in the hole for 48 hours,

84
00:03:55,985 --> 00:03:57,194
extend my sentence.

85
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:59,613
I got four years left.

86
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:02,407
I ain't doing another minute than that.

87
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:03,450
Good.

88
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:05,619
Because I'm not here
for your absolution.

89
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:06,954
I'm here for your redemption.

90
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,792
This is the letter
I told you Jill wrote me.

91
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:13,168
I know.

92
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:16,713
The one you didn't
believe existed.

93
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:19,383
I believe it now. You were involved with
her. This is the proof.

94
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:21,635
Involved with her?
I loved her.

95
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:24,263
And she loved me.

96
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:26,056
Then why did you keep this
relationship a secret?

97
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:27,349
Look at me, man.

98
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:29,309
They gave me a scholarship
to that school,

99
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:31,770
but nobody wanted me dating anybody
at that school.

100
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:33,563
I had a record.

101
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:36,733
If her father ever found out,
I would have been done.

102
00:04:37,568 --> 00:04:38,694
They wouldn't have cared.

103
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:39,945
Like you didn't care.

104
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:43,657
Where did this come from?

105
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:45,409
It was buried,
but it got found.

106
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:47,869
And this is why
you believe I'm innocent.

107
00:04:48,162 --> 00:04:49,162
Yes.

108
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:50,914
And this is enough
to get me out?

109
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,792
No. But that wasn't
the only thing they buried.

110
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:56,461
Jill's dress had
your DNA on it.

111
00:04:56,754 --> 00:04:59,006
But there was another piece of clothing
that had blood on it.

112
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:01,174
A camisole.
And they buried that

113
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,844
because that DNA wasn't hers
and it wasn't yours.

114
00:05:05,054 --> 00:05:06,888
Let me guess.
It was Jason Black's.

115
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:10,142
Unfortunately, I don't have
access to his DNA.

116
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:12,436
So, you finally going to go after him
and Matt Bailey?

117
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:15,772
I'm not a prosecutor
anymore.

118
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:17,399
Then what the hell
are you here for?

119
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,901
I want you to let me
represent you.

120
00:05:22,947 --> 00:05:24,906
You think I'm going to trust you after
what you did to me?

121
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:28,910
I don't see anyone else lining up to get
your ass out of here.

122
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:33,582
See the money, wanna stay
for your meal

123
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:36,626
Get another piece of pie
for your wife

124
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:40,047
Everybody wanna know
how it feel

125
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:43,425
Everybody wanna see
what it's like

126
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:46,553
I'll even eat a bean pie
I don't mind

127
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:48,180
Me and missy is so early

128
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:50,057
Busy, busy making money

129
00:05:50,558 --> 00:05:52,100
All right!

130
00:05:52,226 --> 00:05:56,938
All step back
I'm 'bout to dance

131
00:05:57,774 --> 00:05:59,483
The greenback boogie

132
00:06:12,413 --> 00:06:13,455
What's that?

133
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:15,082
It's an article where Clifford Danner
took his plea.

134
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,291
- Do you want me to read it to you?
- No.

135
00:06:16,417 --> 00:06:18,668
"Clifford Danner had
a history of violence.

136
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:22,381
"This poor girl was brutally murdered at
a high-end private school.

137
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:26,009
"And quote, 'This doesn't sound like the
work of the squash team captain to me."'

138
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:27,010
I don't know, Harvey.

139
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:29,346
This article makes a pretty compelling
case that he's guilty.

140
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:30,639
Well, he's not.

141
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:33,350
- It's quoting you.
- I was wrong.

142
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:35,977
Jessica, I don't think you should let
Harvey take this case.

143
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:38,313
Louis. We're talking
about a man's life.

144
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:41,191
And if Harvey thinks the kid didn't do
it, then so do I.

145
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:44,361
I understand that. But what Harvey
thinks and what Harvey can prove

146
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:46,154
are two different things.

147
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,865
In my experience with Harvey,
it's one and the same.

148
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:50,784
Listen to me.
He was set up.

149
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,536
Jill Hodgkins went to him

150
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:55,539
and said that she was gonna turn in
these two other guys for selling coke.

151
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:56,665
They killed her

152
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:58,417
and planted the coke
in Clifford's room.

153
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:00,794
I didn't buy his story
because his DNA was on her.

154
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,547
He claimed that it was because they were
having this secret relationship,

155
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:05,090
but he had no proof.

156
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:07,175
And now, he does.

157
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:08,844
Okay. I hate to disagree
with you here,

158
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,637
but I took a little poll
of the partners...

159
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:11,930
Whoa. You did what?

160
00:07:12,056 --> 00:07:13,181
I was discreet.
I assure you.

161
00:07:13,307 --> 00:07:16,601
And they feel, as I do, that Harvey's
actions will hurt this firm.

162
00:07:16,727 --> 00:07:18,979
This firm?
You mean my firm.

163
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:22,607
And when you're running the firm of
Litt, Nothing, and Nobody,

164
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:24,609
then you can make
whatever call you'd like.

165
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:27,988
Until then, you can
just get back to work.

166
00:07:28,489 --> 00:07:30,031
I'm telling you
those guys did it.

167
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:32,534
And as far
as his violent history is concerned,

168
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:34,035
you of all people
are gonna tell me

169
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:36,163
that a person can't change
if they get a second chance?

170
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:38,081
What do you
need me to do?

171
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:46,673
Hey.

172
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:49,551
I need your help.

173
00:07:49,677 --> 00:07:51,344
I thought I made it clear that I don't
expect to hear those words

174
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:52,387
from your mouth ever again.

175
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:54,222
- It's important.
- It's always important.

176
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:55,557
- It's for Harvey.
- It's always for Harvey.

177
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:57,642
He specifically
asked for you.

178
00:07:58,269 --> 00:07:59,144
By name?

179
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,312
He said
he wanted the best.

180
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:01,897
Well, if he didn't
specifically name me

181
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:03,607
and you didn't
specifically tell him,

182
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:06,443
then I am going
to specifically decline.

183
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:09,196
Rachel.

184
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:11,573
Are you kidding me?

185
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,911
Okay. I know that
you're mad at me,

186
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:17,913
but we are talking about a guy
roughly our age

187
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:20,874
who spent over a decade in prison for a
murder that he didn't commit,

188
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,042
and we are trying
to get him out.

189
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:26,838
Don't you think that's more important
than our little... Whatever?

190
00:08:28,257 --> 00:08:29,925
- "Whatever"?
- You know what I mean.

191
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,636
Problems of two people,
hill of beans.

192
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:33,970
I don't know what you're talking about.

193
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:35,055
Casablanca.

194
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:37,432
- Oh, I've never seen that movie.
- You...

195
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:39,142
No, it's old.

196
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:41,478
Old. Oh, my God.

197
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:43,813
Okay. What's your basis
for getting him out?

198
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,857
- Prosecutorial misconduct?
- Buried evidence.

199
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:48,693
Okay. Then, you need
precedents to overturn.

200
00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:50,695
- I already got those.
- Then what?

201
00:08:50,821 --> 00:08:53,823
I need to find out everything I can
about the former DA's cases.

202
00:08:58,996 --> 00:09:00,121
Okay.

203
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,290
- Gone With the Wind?
- No.

204
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:04,125
- Citizen Kane?
- No.

205
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:05,627
- Dirty Dancing?
- "Nobody puts Baby in the corner."

206
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:07,087
- I can't believe you.
- I'm helping you.

207
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:09,047
Come on, let's go.

208
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:11,132
You thought to do
this on your own?

209
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:12,425
I decided
to think like you.

210
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,177
This is a high-profile
murder case

211
00:09:14,303 --> 00:09:16,012
against the new
District Attorney himself.

212
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:17,597
- You know that, right?
- I know.

213
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:19,766
And you think I'm going to let you come
with me for this, don't you?

214
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:21,184
I know you are.

215
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:23,019
You know, I don't want you thinking
like me anymore.

216
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:25,230
- Now, you know how the rest of us feel.
- A-ha! Right there.

217
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:26,773
- I always would have said that.
- No, you wouldn't.

218
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:27,857
Yes, I would.

219
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:33,154
Harvey Specter.

220
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:34,864
Terrance Wolf.
That your case?

221
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:37,909
I thought it best
to cut a deal.

222
00:09:38,035 --> 00:09:39,869
Let him out
for time served.

223
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:42,205
High-profile murder
at a prep school.

224
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:44,833
No, I don't think
I'll be cutting any deals.

225
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:49,004
Miguel Ruiz, Lawrence Baker,
Ray Jenkins, Calvin Reynolds.

226
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,880
And who are
these gentlemen?

227
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:53,883
They're other cases with improprieties
that we'll be forced to cite

228
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:56,219
if we have to file
to reopen.

229
00:09:56,345 --> 00:09:58,430
You of all people
don't want that.

230
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:00,181
Really? Why not?

231
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:01,600
Because it will
make you look bad.

232
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:03,893
Didn't happen on my watch.

233
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,854
You're supposed to be
cleaning up the office.

234
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,814
I find sunshine
is the best disinfectant.

235
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,149
Your mother teach you that?

236
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:10,942
No, Harvey,
life taught me that.

237
00:10:11,068 --> 00:10:12,319
This man is innocent.

238
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:13,528
Then he should
have gone to trial.

239
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:14,904
Evidence was buried.

240
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:18,408
Then dig it up
and make your case.

241
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:21,161
Mike. Give me a minute.

242
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:26,916
Terrance, you're forcing me to do
something that I'd rather not do.

243
00:10:27,251 --> 00:10:29,044
- And what is that?
- Take this case on.

244
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:31,129
I win. It's what I do.

245
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:34,466
It will send a message
around your entire office

246
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:36,176
that you can't
handle your business.

247
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:39,429
Well, if I lose, I lose.
That's the way the law works.

248
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:43,141
But, Harvey, don't think
I can't send a message or two myself.

249
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:46,603
Rumor has it, you're the traitor who
sold out his former boss.

250
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:48,772
Wasn't me.
Those rumors are wrong.

251
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:52,901
So, mysterious evidence
from back in the day

252
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:55,362
of your old boss
just appeared.

253
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:01,576
You didn't know.
Maybe it wasn't you.

254
00:11:02,953 --> 00:11:05,914
But it had to be somebody.
Right, Harvey?

255
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,749
Have a nice day.

256
00:11:12,296 --> 00:11:13,838
My office. Now.

257
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,928
I have never thought
about firing you.

258
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:23,056
You took something when we quit
the DA's office?

259
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:24,432
Come clean right now
or I'll let you go.

260
00:11:24,558 --> 00:11:25,642
Not give it
a minute's thought.

261
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:28,853
I knew it.

262
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:30,689
You were in trouble.

263
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,357
You had no right.

264
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:33,733
I don't care.

265
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:36,945
What did you do with it?

266
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:39,364
She did what she had to do.
She gave it to me.

267
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:42,033
And the two of you saw fit
to fight my battles for me?

268
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:44,869
We did what you would have done
for either one of us.

269
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:48,915
So, get off your high horse.
Leave the woman alone.

270
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:54,337
We work because I've always known
that I can trust you.

271
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:56,756
Don't ever go behind
my back again.

272
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:00,051
You're welcome.

273
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:13,690
Wait.
He called you?

274
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:15,734
Yeah.
He left a message.

275
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,069
What did he say?

276
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:22,073
That he wanted
to see me.

277
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:24,325
And what did you do?

278
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:26,828
I texted him and I told him
I wasn't interested.

279
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:30,832
We've got to tell him.

280
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:33,835
- No, we don't.
- Yeah, we do.

281
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,837
I am already
living a lie at work.

282
00:12:35,963 --> 00:12:37,547
I can't live one
at home, too.

283
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:39,132
Do you think that
if you tell Trevor about us,

284
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:40,675
he's going to keep
your secret to himself?

285
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:43,428
I know Trevor. If I tell him, he will
take it up with me.

286
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:45,513
- If he hears it from someone else...
- Who's gonna tell him?

287
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:48,433
I don't know. Okay? I just... I know
that he's over there right now

288
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:49,976
and it's drilling
a hole in my brain.

289
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:54,147
- Then stay here.
- I can't.

290
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:56,441
- Why not?
- Because he came to me for help.

291
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:04,032
Okay.

292
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:08,703
- Okay, what?
- Tell him.

293
00:13:09,246 --> 00:13:11,956
But please wait until he has his life
back together.

294
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:13,082
What do you mean?

295
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:14,459
He came to you for help.

296
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:18,004
How much help do you think hearing about
us is going to be for him?

297
00:13:20,424 --> 00:13:22,258
- Okay.
- Okay, what?

298
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:23,760
Okay, I'll stay.

299
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:28,348
Could you just
not touch anything?

300
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:29,974
Because

301
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,810
I like my place just so.

302
00:13:33,687 --> 00:13:35,438
What?
This place is a mess.

303
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:36,981
What are you...

304
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:46,282
The court finds sufficient misconduct
to warrant a new trial.

305
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:48,785
Any pretrial motions
at this time?

306
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:50,328
Yes, Your Honor.

307
00:13:50,454 --> 00:13:52,789
The State advises that we will be
seeking the maximum sentence

308
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:53,790
of life in prison.

309
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:54,874
What?

310
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,001
Your Honor, my client
has four years left.

311
00:13:57,127 --> 00:14:00,213
Mr. Specter, the state has every right
to seek that penalty.

312
00:14:00,464 --> 00:14:02,632
Would you like to
confer with your client

313
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:04,801
before I vacate
his conviction?

314
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:07,220
Or you could just withdraw
your motion right now.

315
00:14:07,471 --> 00:14:09,180
I'll confer with
my client, Your Honor.

316
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:15,812
Get the message?

317
00:14:20,734 --> 00:14:21,943
Four more years.

318
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:24,362
Or you get out now.

319
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,364
Or stay in
the rest of my life.

320
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:31,369
September 19th, 2007.

321
00:14:31,495 --> 00:14:33,037
What?

322
00:14:33,163 --> 00:14:34,497
His halfway point.

323
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:39,752
I realized
I could make it.

324
00:14:41,171 --> 00:14:42,422
You never said
this could happen.

325
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:43,548
He is sending a message.

326
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:44,757
It's got nothing
to do with you.

327
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,426
It's got everything
to do with me.

328
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:48,052
What do you wanna do?

329
00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:51,139
What do you think?
If we win, I want in.

330
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:53,141
- If we lose, I don't.
- We'll win.

331
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:56,102
- How do you know?
- Because I know.

332
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:57,729
The same way
you knew I was guilty?

333
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:02,609
What do you think?

334
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:04,277
I think Harvey
wins his cases.

335
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:06,613
What would you do?

336
00:15:07,823 --> 00:15:08,990
I'd trust him.

337
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:13,202
Harvey, can you
give us a minute?

338
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:29,177
Clifford,
I don't know you

339
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:30,803
and you don't know me.

340
00:15:31,805 --> 00:15:36,059
But I'm going to tell you a story about
what that man did for me

341
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:38,019
and why I think
you should trust him.

342
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:42,482
Court is now in session.

343
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:49,072
Mr. Specter.

344
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:51,240
You going to withdraw
your motion?

345
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:53,993
Your Honor, my client wishes
to proceed to trial.

346
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:10,718
Gensync Chemical.

347
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:12,929
They dropped us today.

348
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,180
Louis' client?

349
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:16,099
Louis' Fortune 500 client.

350
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:17,725
You want to guess why?

351
00:16:17,851 --> 00:16:19,519
His ears?
They freak a lot of people out.

352
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:20,979
That was one client.

353
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:22,897
His teeth?
The fidgeting?

354
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:25,274
- It could be anything.
- Okay, stop it.

355
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:27,902
Let me guess. One of the board members
has a kid who went to this school.

356
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:29,112
A daughter.

357
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:30,905
And Louis correctly
pointed out

358
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:32,573
that they might not
be the only clients

359
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,200
that will punish us
for taking this case.

360
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:35,910
- Which costs us money.
- Mmm.

361
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:37,578
Louis is in the
majority this time.

362
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:40,415
Which hurts your position
with the partners.

363
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:42,250
You telling me
to drop this?

364
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:43,501
I'm telling you to win.

365
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:47,213
But that's not why I called you in here.
Have a seat.

366
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:55,722
- Donna.
- Mmm-hmm.

367
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:58,057
You need to get over it.

368
00:16:58,183 --> 00:16:59,392
I'm trying.
It's not that easy.

369
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:00,727
Yes, it is.

370
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:02,937
- Tell me.
- Okay.

371
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:06,190
Think about what your life
would be like without her.

372
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:12,447
Now, I know.

373
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:13,698
Know what?

374
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:15,575
How you always
forgive me.

375
00:17:16,326 --> 00:17:17,910
Oh, it's nowhere near
as easy to forgive you.

376
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:19,162
Think about it.

377
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:24,000
Oh, I do.
Every goddamn day.

378
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:37,305
- Hey.
- Hey.

379
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:38,973
We're starting
trial today.

380
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:41,225
I know.
You've got five minutes.

381
00:17:41,351 --> 00:17:43,311
I've never started a trial
without doing our thing.

382
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:44,937
Well, you don't have time.

383
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:46,272
There's plenty of time.

384
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:48,191
You don't have time.

385
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:54,155
I'm sorry.

386
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,121
- For what?
- Don't push it.

387
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:05,208
Okay, let's go.
We've got three minutes.

388
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:07,210
- Okay. Here or in my office?
- Here's good.

389
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:09,253
Okay. On three.
One, two...

390
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:10,505
Wait, let's go
in your office.

391
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:12,423
- I'll get the can opener.
- Yeah.

392
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,179
You left that
in the kitchen.

393
00:18:18,305 --> 00:18:19,972
Thanks. I hate it
when I do that.

394
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:22,016
You don't have any numbers
in your speed dial.

395
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:23,059
I don't need them.

396
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:24,644
And yet,
you forgot your phone.

397
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:27,021
- It's not the same thing.
- Okay.

398
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:28,689
Hey, Rachel.

399
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:31,651
Thank you. For before.

400
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:33,694
Sure. I mean,

401
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,656
it was for Harvey.

402
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:39,033
Yes. Yeah.

403
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:47,625
Hey.

404
00:18:47,751 --> 00:18:49,001
Today's your first trial.

405
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:52,130
What? I've been
to trial before.

406
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:54,048
Yeah, but not when
you've been with me.

407
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:55,758
Fair enough.

408
00:18:56,426 --> 00:18:58,553
Okay, I want to start
a ritual with you.

409
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:01,848
What do you want to do?
We're on the phone.

410
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:05,017
Remember that gymnastics video
we saw?

411
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,478
Yeah. I can
get behind that.

412
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:11,774
Feeling good?

413
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:12,942
Never better. You?

414
00:19:13,068 --> 00:19:15,153
Oh, I'm ready to roll.

415
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:17,488
Don't think I didn't
see that can opener.

416
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:28,040
What do you think you're doing,
re-opening this case?

417
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:31,836
Making sure an innocent man doesn't
suffer for the crimes of others.

418
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:34,755
What about Jill? Don't you care
how she suffered?

419
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:37,258
You two would know more about that
than anyone, right?

420
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:38,384
Excuse me?

421
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:40,887
I bought the devastated friend act
12 years ago.

422
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:42,847
But I know better now.

423
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:45,683
Mike, meet Jason Black
and Matt Bailey.

424
00:19:45,934 --> 00:19:47,393
Just don't
shake their hands.

425
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:49,395
They've got Jill Hodgkins'
blood all over them.

426
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:51,856
Look, I don't know what you think you
know, but when I'm done testifying,

427
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:54,483
the jury's going to know
that Clifford killed Jill.

428
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:58,696
Just because you switched sides doesn't
mean the rest of the world did.

429
00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:04,911
- We just lost the letter.
- What?

430
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:06,954
I didn't realize he'd have
the nerve to lie on the stand.

431
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,832
It's not exactly a giant leap from
killing someone.

432
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:11,792
Perjury and murder,
they aren't the same thing.

433
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:14,045
Yeah. Murder's worse.

434
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,631
It's easier.
Nobody's watching.

435
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:18,674
Let's go.

436
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,969
Mr. Black, what exactly did Jill tell
you regarding the defendant?

437
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:24,222
She told me
she felt trapped.

438
00:20:24,848 --> 00:20:26,390
I thought she was
talking about school.

439
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:27,850
But now, I know
what she meant.

440
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:33,147
That letter was dated a week before
she was killed.

441
00:20:33,273 --> 00:20:34,982
She must have
broken up with him

442
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:36,817
and this is how
he paid her back.

443
00:20:39,821 --> 00:20:42,657
Mr. Black, you said you didn't see Jill
Hodgkins at all

444
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:44,116
on the day of the murder.
Is that correct?

445
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:45,117
Correct.

446
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:47,954
So, there'd be no reason for your blood
to be on any of her clothing at all.

447
00:20:49,706 --> 00:20:50,790
No, there'd be no reason.

448
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,292
Would you be willing
to have a DNA test, Mr. Black?

449
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:54,835
Objection, Your Honor.
Prejudicial.

450
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:56,420
We'll pay for it,
if that's a problem.

451
00:20:56,546 --> 00:20:58,005
Mr. Specter.

452
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:02,426
It's about the DNA
and they can't spin that.

453
00:21:03,887 --> 00:21:05,429
Detective Packel.

454
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:08,891
The dress wasn't the only article of
clothing that you submitted, was it?

455
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,394
No. There was a camisole.

456
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,645
Was it in your report?

457
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:14,730
Yeah. If you
bothered to read it.

458
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:16,023
I did read it, Detective.

459
00:21:16,483 --> 00:21:19,110
And what was the DNA analysis
on that camisole?

460
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:21,237
- I never picked it up.
- Why is that?

461
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:22,863
Well, it wasn't ready
until two days later.

462
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:24,740
And we already had enough
from the dress.

463
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:25,992
Enough?

464
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:27,952
A man's life is at stake.
Enough for what?

465
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:31,247
Enough for you to put him away without
bringing it up for 12 years.

466
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:34,000
Well, I did pick up that test, along
with the camisole.

467
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:36,127
Your Honor, I'd like
to request a sidebar.

468
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:37,295
On what grounds?

469
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:40,756
The camisole and any evidence connected
to it are inadmissible.

470
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:51,309
- This is bullshit.
- Easy.

471
00:21:51,935 --> 00:21:53,519
- What?
- Your Honor,

472
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:55,730
in between picking up the camisole
at the precinct

473
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:57,315
and dropping it off
at the lab,

474
00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:59,442
you can see here
the document is flawed.

475
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:01,110
Therefore,
the chain of possession

476
00:22:01,236 --> 00:22:03,612
with respect
to the camisole was broken.

477
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:04,989
You have to be kidding me.

478
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:06,782
It's inadmissible.

479
00:22:10,954 --> 00:22:12,121
First six.

480
00:22:12,956 --> 00:22:14,040
What?

481
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:16,292
The first six months
are the hardest.

482
00:22:17,127 --> 00:22:18,753
In your mind.

483
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:23,632
I don't know if
I can do that again.

484
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:25,926
Mr. Specter.

485
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:29,805
You are accusing a police officer of
tampering with evidence.

486
00:22:29,931 --> 00:22:30,806
Yes, I am.

487
00:22:30,932 --> 00:22:33,768
When the results of the DNA test came
back, they didn't line up.

488
00:22:33,894 --> 00:22:36,479
And Detective Packel changed
the custody documents.

489
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:38,981
Even if Mr. Specter's
assertions were true,

490
00:22:39,107 --> 00:22:40,858
it would automatically
taint the evidence, anyway.

491
00:22:40,984 --> 00:22:42,026
He's got a point.

492
00:22:42,152 --> 00:22:45,654
That camisole was what allowed us to
reopen this case in the first place.

493
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:47,907
That camisole was proof
that evidence was buried.

494
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:50,159
That's why the
case was reopened.

495
00:22:50,285 --> 00:22:51,494
An entirely separate issue

496
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:53,996
from whether that evidence
can be used in this trial.

497
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:55,748
Clifford,

498
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:57,458
I don't know what's
going on in there,

499
00:22:57,584 --> 00:22:59,794
but no matter
what they rule,

500
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:01,754
he's not going
to lose this one.

501
00:23:03,298 --> 00:23:04,799
You sure?

502
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:06,550
Yeah. I am.

503
00:23:06,843 --> 00:23:07,718
Your Honor.

504
00:23:07,844 --> 00:23:08,844
That's enough.

505
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:11,555
I'm instructing the jury
to disregard all testimony

506
00:23:11,681 --> 00:23:15,393
relating to either the camisole or
the resulting DNA test.

507
00:23:20,273 --> 00:23:22,817
Oh, my goodness. I'm so sorry.
Are you okay?

508
00:23:23,985 --> 00:23:24,944
Get out of my face.

509
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,821
What the hell are you doing,
reopening this?

510
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:29,240
You worried about getting caught
intentionally tainting evidence?

511
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:30,491
I didn't taint anything.

512
00:23:30,617 --> 00:23:32,493
What I did was
help you put away a guilty man

513
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:34,245
for brutally killing
a young girl.

514
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:36,747
And I'm not going to let you drag my
reputation through the gutter.

515
00:23:37,124 --> 00:23:38,207
Not without consequences.

516
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:39,750
Are you threatening me?

517
00:23:39,876 --> 00:23:41,627
Because the truth is,
you wouldn't even be here

518
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:42,962
if you hadn't done
something wrong.

519
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:44,839
Me. Yeah.

520
00:23:44,965 --> 00:23:47,258
It's all well and good for you to drag
up shit from the past, huh?

521
00:23:47,384 --> 00:23:49,176
You're protected
by your shiny suit, right?

522
00:23:49,302 --> 00:23:50,344
What are you talking about?

523
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:52,388
Lawyers never go
after their own.

524
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:54,181
What is that Denzel movie?

525
00:23:54,307 --> 00:23:56,225
Tell it to me
like I'm a five-year-old.

526
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:59,770
Sometimes, the good guys
got to do bad things

527
00:23:59,896 --> 00:24:01,188
to make the bad guys pay.

528
00:24:05,652 --> 00:24:07,695
It's time to start painting
outside the lines.

529
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:09,155
How?

530
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:11,115
If Muhammad won't come
to the mountain,

531
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:13,701
we need to bring the
mountain to Muhammad.

532
00:24:13,827 --> 00:24:15,828
Really?
The mountain to Muhammad?

533
00:24:16,329 --> 00:24:17,872
- It's a thing.
- Yeah. I know.

534
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:19,874
It just has no meaning to me
in this situation.

535
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,376
You said you could think like me.
Figure it out.

536
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:25,087
- Okay. Yeah. I got it.
- What is it?

537
00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:26,964
- You tell me. I'll confirm.
- Nice try.

538
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:28,090
Damn it.

539
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:40,769
Why did you
text me, Matty?

540
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:42,771
We've got nothing
to talk about.

541
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:44,690
I didn't text you.
You texted me.

542
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:50,488
- We've got to go.
- Yes.

543
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:52,698
Come on.
Does it really matter who texted who?

544
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:54,825
Why not take advantage
of the fact you get to see each other?

545
00:24:54,951 --> 00:24:56,911
Catch up.
Talk about old times.

546
00:24:57,037 --> 00:24:58,746
Yeah, like that time
that you murdered that girl

547
00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:00,247
and framed
an innocent man.

548
00:25:00,373 --> 00:25:01,373
We didn't do anything.

549
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,042
- You're wasting your time.
- Am I?

550
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:04,460
We know the truth.

551
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:07,087
It's just a matter of time until one of
you turns on the other one.

552
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:08,923
The question is,
who's it going to be?

553
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:11,133
We were there today. You're the ones
running out of time.

554
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:14,803
Asshole.

555
00:25:16,473 --> 00:25:19,475
Looks like the rattlesnakes are starting
to commit suicide.

556
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:23,479
Holy shit. That's from
Mississippi Burning.

557
00:25:23,605 --> 00:25:25,856
This whole idea is from
Mississippi Burning.

558
00:25:25,982 --> 00:25:27,983
You know that movie? I was trying to
stump you with that one.

559
00:25:28,109 --> 00:25:29,360
Front to back.
Give me a break.

560
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:32,446
The problem is those two don't seem like
they're going to break.

561
00:25:32,572 --> 00:25:35,115
They know we don't have anything.
Only now, we do.

562
00:25:37,285 --> 00:25:39,203
So, by the mountain
to Muhammad, you meant...

563
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:41,038
DNA coming to Mr. Wolf.

564
00:25:41,831 --> 00:25:42,998
That's good.

565
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:53,759
- Hi, Donna.
- Hi, Louis.

566
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:54,969
- You're never...
- I know.

567
00:25:55,095 --> 00:25:56,887
- Why?
- I need a favor.

568
00:25:58,765 --> 00:26:00,057
You mean Harvey
needs a favor.

569
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:02,726
Oh, that's very
astute of you.

570
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:05,354
A big one.

571
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:07,940
You know your cousin
in the DNA lab?

572
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:10,067
- We need something today.
- No.

573
00:26:10,193 --> 00:26:11,944
- It's for...
- I know what it's for.

574
00:26:13,488 --> 00:26:14,905
What do you want?

575
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:19,535
- I don't want anything.
- I will fill in for Norma.

576
00:26:23,206 --> 00:26:24,623
Okay.

577
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:26,041
I'm not being vindictive.

578
00:26:26,167 --> 00:26:27,543
I'm sorry. Do I have
the right office?

579
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:29,295
Listen to me. I want you,
God damn it.

580
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:31,130
And I would throw that secretary
right out the window

581
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:32,506
if I knew you were going to be
my secretary.

582
00:26:32,632 --> 00:26:34,550
But I have a reputation
that I value,

583
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:36,302
and I'm not going to be putting
my reputation on the line

584
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:38,304
for something that
I do not believe in...

585
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:40,347
American Ballet Theatre?

586
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:44,476
No.

587
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:49,106
Followed by a one-on-one dinner
with Baryshnikov.

588
00:26:53,194 --> 00:26:54,778
Oh, mommy.

589
00:26:58,992 --> 00:27:00,242
No, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

590
00:27:00,368 --> 00:27:02,995
No, no. Mmm-mmm.

591
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:05,789
- Nope. I'm sorry.
- Okay.

592
00:27:05,915 --> 00:27:06,790
- Can't do it.
- Got it.

593
00:27:06,916 --> 00:27:08,208
- Okay?
- Mmm-hmm.

594
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:09,752
- Do you understand why?
- It's very clear to me.

595
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:10,753
Do you know?
Because...

596
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:12,338
- Do you understand why I said no?
- I hear you, Louis.

597
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:14,548
- Louis... Shh.
- I want to. But I can't.

598
00:27:16,384 --> 00:27:19,094
- What?
- Let go.

599
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:26,018
Jessica would like to see you
in her office.

600
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:29,855
Oh, that phony bitch.

601
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:34,735
Call your cousin.

602
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:36,320
- It is not that simple.
- Yes, it is.

603
00:27:36,446 --> 00:27:38,906
You've compromised your principles
before. Do it now.

604
00:27:39,032 --> 00:27:41,492
Like I told Donna,
this isn't for me.

605
00:27:41,618 --> 00:27:42,701
This is for Harvey.

606
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:44,745
Wrong. It's for me.

607
00:27:44,871 --> 00:27:46,455
Okay. You know,
you want this so bad,

608
00:27:46,581 --> 00:27:49,792
why don't you maybe
compromise your principles a little bit?

609
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:51,168
- Excuse me?
- Yeah.

610
00:27:51,294 --> 00:27:52,795
You know my billables. You talk about it
all the time.

611
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:54,755
"Louis, you've got
big billables."

612
00:27:54,881 --> 00:27:55,839
You've seen my loyalty.

613
00:27:56,383 --> 00:27:58,467
Yet, you refuse
to acknowledge my value.

614
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:01,011
- Where is this going?
- Where is this going?

615
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:04,807
When you said Litt,
Nothing, and Nobody,

616
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:06,850
you know what
that said to me?

617
00:28:06,976 --> 00:28:09,978
That said, "Louis, you're never going to
make senior partner."

618
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:12,940
Well, Harvey's running out of time.
This is my leverage.

619
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:16,527
I wanna make senior partner and I wanna
make senior partner now.

620
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:19,947
Louis, I do not
respond to threats.

621
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:20,948
I make them.

622
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:24,660
So, if you ever want to be senior
partner, you call your cousin.

623
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,495
Now.

624
00:28:26,621 --> 00:28:27,871
All right.

625
00:28:28,832 --> 00:28:30,833
I don't need to see the results.
I saw their faces.

626
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:31,959
They did it.

627
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:34,002
What happened
to the letter?

628
00:28:36,256 --> 00:28:38,173
They made it seem
like it didn't matter.

629
00:28:38,299 --> 00:28:40,008
Like, he was jealous.

630
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:41,844
And so, he killed her.

631
00:28:43,847 --> 00:28:46,014
- Well, I...
- What?

632
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:48,976
I'm just wondering,
what would have happened

633
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:51,395
if they hadn't kept their
relationship a secret.

634
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:58,110
I have to make
a phone call.

635
00:28:58,486 --> 00:28:59,820
Okay.

636
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:04,032
Jenny, hey. It's me.

637
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:08,871
I can't keep this a secret
from Trevor anymore.

638
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:11,790
I need to tell him.

639
00:29:12,959 --> 00:29:13,959
Call me.

640
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:24,386
DNA results. Jason Black
and Matt Bailey.

641
00:29:24,512 --> 00:29:27,431
They match samples of the DNA taken
from that camisole.

642
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:29,057
They did it.

643
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:31,018
- Where did you get that?
- I found it.

644
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:32,478
That doesn't
prove anything.

645
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:34,438
- It's their blood on her.
- So, what?

646
00:29:34,564 --> 00:29:35,898
They could have had
a gym class together

647
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:38,817
or played flag football or any one of
a hundred other reasons.

648
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:40,986
Jason Black said
he didn't see her that day.

649
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:43,947
It's two specks of blood
from what could easily be

650
00:29:44,073 --> 00:29:45,741
- any other day.
- What's wrong with you?

651
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:49,036
Me? You come in here with
some unauthorized DNA test

652
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:50,621
and right away,
you expect me

653
00:29:50,747 --> 00:29:52,247
to just release a convicted felon into
the streets.

654
00:29:52,373 --> 00:29:53,248
He didn't do it.

655
00:29:53,374 --> 00:29:54,583
And how can you allow him to sit in
there

656
00:29:54,709 --> 00:29:56,084
while these two other murderers go free?

657
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:58,003
Let me explain
something to you.

658
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:01,215
My job is to prosecute.
Your job is to defend.

659
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:03,091
I didn't bury any evidence.

660
00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:04,676
I didn't toss that DNA.

661
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:06,345
The judge did that,
based on fact.

662
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:08,722
You're coming
after me for the sins of someone else.

663
00:30:08,848 --> 00:30:11,183
This piece of paper here
means nothing.

664
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:14,645
So, unless one of those two boys
just up and volunteer

665
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:16,063
that they killed that girl,

666
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:19,691
your client is going to go back to
prison for the rest of his life.

667
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:21,485
Terrance,
you have a reputation as a fair man.

668
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:24,071
I don't give a damn what
other people think of me.

669
00:30:24,197 --> 00:30:25,405
I care about what
I think of me.

670
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:36,083
- It didn't work.
- What's next?

671
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:38,335
What's next is we have to
put on a defense tomorrow.

672
00:30:38,461 --> 00:30:39,628
We got nothing.

673
00:30:40,213 --> 00:30:42,297
So, what are we
going to do?

674
00:30:42,423 --> 00:30:43,966
I don't know.

675
00:30:46,344 --> 00:30:47,928
Ooh, Rachel.

676
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:50,138
What are you
doing in here?

677
00:30:50,265 --> 00:30:51,723
You have access
to the Partners' kitchen.

678
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,560
Yeah. I like to keep
my finger on the pulse.

679
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:56,854
Plus, they don't
have Cheetos.

680
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,230
Actually, I don't care
about the pulse.

681
00:30:59,065 --> 00:31:00,065
Hmm.

682
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:06,321
Okay. Either I am losing it or you are
upset about something.

683
00:31:06,447 --> 00:31:08,824
So, what are you
upset about?

684
00:31:09,742 --> 00:31:11,994
- I don't want to talk about it.
- Got it.

685
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,245
Mike Ross.

686
00:31:14,455 --> 00:31:15,873
How do you know that?

687
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:17,583
I'm Donna. I know.

688
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:19,418
Donna, what am
I going to do?

689
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:21,003
There's only
one thing to do.

690
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:22,379
Quit.

691
00:31:22,755 --> 00:31:24,047
- Kill her?
- Well...

692
00:31:26,801 --> 00:31:27,718
You need a drink.

693
00:31:28,595 --> 00:31:29,720
Yes.

694
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,222
Two?

695
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:34,433
We should barf.

696
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:43,358
Take them off.

697
00:31:43,484 --> 00:31:44,526
Huh?

698
00:31:44,652 --> 00:31:45,736
Take them off.
He's not an animal.

699
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:47,154
I want to talk to him
like a man.

700
00:31:59,375 --> 00:32:01,209
What happened?

701
00:32:03,379 --> 00:32:04,922
Wolf won't drop
the charges.

702
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:07,257
What?

703
00:32:07,383 --> 00:32:08,508
I tried everything.

704
00:32:09,636 --> 00:32:10,844
You tried.

705
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:13,597
Look, we can cut a deal.
We can ask for more time.

706
00:32:13,723 --> 00:32:15,557
- He already said no way.
- We have got to...

707
00:32:15,683 --> 00:32:16,892
Try?

708
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:19,895
Try like you did
with the DNA?

709
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:21,563
I had four years.

710
00:32:22,023 --> 00:32:24,608
Four years of 16 that I only had in the
first place because of you.

711
00:32:24,734 --> 00:32:26,193
- Clifford, we...
- Shut up.

712
00:32:28,529 --> 00:32:30,155
Why don't you
take it out on me?

713
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:31,281
What did you say?

714
00:32:31,407 --> 00:32:33,158
- I said take it out on me.
- Harvey.

715
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:34,701
I put you in there.

716
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:36,745
I let you rot.

717
00:32:37,246 --> 00:32:40,290
I didn't give it a minute's thought
for over a decade.

718
00:32:41,751 --> 00:32:43,001
- Don't push me.
- Why not?

719
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:45,212
I deserve it. It's my fault.
You said it yourself.

720
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:46,213
Harvey.

721
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:47,756
They'll put me back in the hole.
That's why not.

722
00:32:47,882 --> 00:32:49,257
- Harvey, come on.
- And increase your sentence?

723
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:50,968
- It's going to happen, anyway.
- Guard.

724
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:52,344
Come on.
You know, Jason Black...

725
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:53,887
- I said don't push me.
...and Matt Bailey,

726
00:32:54,013 --> 00:32:55,263
- they killed Jill.
- Guard, get in here!

727
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:57,766
And they are out there
laughing their asses off...

728
00:32:57,892 --> 00:32:59,434
- Knock it off!
- You know what?

729
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,061
No, come here!
Get off of him!

730
00:33:01,187 --> 00:33:02,062
You tried?

731
00:33:02,188 --> 00:33:03,063
- Let's go.
- You said you would

732
00:33:03,189 --> 00:33:04,731
- get me out of here!
- Let's go.

733
00:33:04,857 --> 00:33:07,067
You said
you'd get me out!

734
00:33:09,612 --> 00:33:11,238
What just happened?

735
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:13,699
I just bought us 48 hours.

736
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:20,831
Now, what?

737
00:33:20,957 --> 00:33:22,457
I'm going to beat the shit out of one
of those guys

738
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:23,667
and get him to rat
on the other one.

739
00:33:23,793 --> 00:33:26,086
- Which one?
- The weaker one.

740
00:33:26,212 --> 00:33:28,213
- Which one is that?
- The one who didn't testify.

741
00:33:28,923 --> 00:33:30,924
You're serious.
You can't do that.

742
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,467
Who's going to stop me?

743
00:33:32,593 --> 00:33:33,844
Harvey, it wouldn't
be admissible.

744
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:34,803
You'll never get
them that way.

745
00:33:34,929 --> 00:33:36,847
- But it will get Clifford out.
- How?

746
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:39,224
Wolf won't be able to deny
that he's innocent anymore.

747
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:41,309
Harvey, you don't do this.
You can't beat people.

748
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:42,853
- That's not what you do.
- It is today.

749
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:44,312
Harvey, stop.

750
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:47,858
Listen, I've got
another idea.

751
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:49,776
- What?
- You'll like it.

752
00:33:49,902 --> 00:33:51,820
It's from Mississippi Burning.
Come on.

753
00:34:01,831 --> 00:34:04,583
So, all of these
things are from clients?

754
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:05,792
Yeah, pretty much.

755
00:34:05,918 --> 00:34:07,627
This pen.

756
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:10,422
Remember that big Trump scandal you
heard about last year?

757
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:12,132
- No.
- Exactly.

758
00:34:15,094 --> 00:34:16,720
Oh! Don't touch that.

759
00:34:17,513 --> 00:34:19,431
Signed by Patrick Ewing.

760
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:21,058
He'll know. I'll never hear
the end of it.

761
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:22,476
All right. This one?

762
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:25,062
- Bird.
- He's from Boston.

763
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:27,814
- White man's hero.
- Hmm.

764
00:34:30,818 --> 00:34:32,152
Yeah, it's Kobe.
He won't care.

765
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:36,239
You really know him.

766
00:34:38,785 --> 00:34:40,243
I really do.

767
00:34:51,464 --> 00:34:53,757
- No.
- Never?

768
00:34:53,883 --> 00:34:54,841
No.

769
00:34:55,843 --> 00:34:57,010
Ever?

770
00:34:57,136 --> 00:34:58,261
No.

771
00:34:58,387 --> 00:34:59,805
- Never ever?
- No.

772
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:04,810
Why not?

773
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:14,027
Because you can
never go back.

774
00:35:19,158 --> 00:35:20,909
I got to pee.

775
00:35:43,891 --> 00:35:46,977
Hey, man.
I got your message.

776
00:35:47,103 --> 00:35:48,019
What did you
want to talk about?

777
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:49,563
It can wait.

778
00:35:50,439 --> 00:35:51,940
Do you remember when you said you would
have died that day

779
00:35:52,066 --> 00:35:53,567
- if it hadn't been for Harvey?
- Yeah.

780
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:55,777
Well,

781
00:35:55,903 --> 00:35:56,987
he needs your help.

782
00:36:10,751 --> 00:36:12,252
Wake up, Matt.

783
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:16,131
Shh!

784
00:36:18,801 --> 00:36:20,051
Who are you?
What do you want?

785
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:22,512
It's not who I am.
It's who I represent.

786
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:24,055
Jason Black.

787
00:36:25,391 --> 00:36:26,725
He knows you talked
to the police.

788
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:28,059
No, I didn't. I swear.

789
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:29,978
Yeah, that's not
my department.

790
00:36:30,396 --> 00:36:32,939
Now, Matt, you're going
to retract what you said,

791
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:34,941
you're going to leave town,

792
00:36:35,067 --> 00:36:36,318
and you're never going
to talk to them again.

793
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:39,112
Or next time,

794
00:36:43,743 --> 00:36:44,993
that's going to
be your head.

795
00:37:10,019 --> 00:37:11,102
Somebody call the police?

796
00:37:13,689 --> 00:37:16,149
You. You... What are you
doing here?

797
00:37:16,275 --> 00:37:17,317
Hey, Matt.

798
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:21,154
Relax. The detective was across
the street the whole time.

799
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:23,865
We knew Jason
would send somebody.

800
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:25,992
What?

801
00:37:26,118 --> 00:37:28,286
Who do you think told Jason you went to
the police in the first place?

802
00:37:28,412 --> 00:37:29,454
I did.

803
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:31,998
Harvey showed me the results
of the DNA test.

804
00:37:32,124 --> 00:37:35,043
Two splotches.
Jason Black's and yours.

805
00:37:38,464 --> 00:37:41,007
Okay. Um... Uh...

806
00:37:41,133 --> 00:37:42,676
I want to file a report.

807
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:44,010
Oh.

808
00:37:44,387 --> 00:37:47,138
Sure. I'll take
you downtown.

809
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:49,641
You look through the books.
Maybe you find something.

810
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:50,642
Maybe you don't.

811
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:52,602
But your real problem
isn't that guy.

812
00:37:52,728 --> 00:37:53,895
It's Jason Black.

813
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:56,690
Somebody was going
to turn him in once before.

814
00:37:57,024 --> 00:37:59,484
And I think you know
the lengths he'll go to

815
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:00,568
to shut somebody up.

816
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:02,988
No, I don't.
No, I don't.

817
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:05,323
We were here this time.
We won't be here next time.

818
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:07,742
Next time. What would have happened if
he would have killed me this time?

819
00:38:07,868 --> 00:38:10,036
Well, you'd be dead and we'd have
caught the guy

820
00:38:10,162 --> 00:38:12,163
and used him to put
Jason away for murder.

821
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:13,873
- Shit, we should have done that.
- Yeah.

822
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,083
Harvey, behave.

823
00:38:15,209 --> 00:38:16,501
What do you want?
What do you want from me?

824
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:17,585
What do you want from me?

825
00:38:17,712 --> 00:38:18,920
Confess to the crime.

826
00:38:19,255 --> 00:38:20,463
Turn in Jason Black.

827
00:38:20,756 --> 00:38:21,798
No. I can't do that.

828
00:38:21,924 --> 00:38:23,216
Yes, you can.
I'll tell you why.

829
00:38:23,342 --> 00:38:25,969
You were 16.
A juvenile.

830
00:38:26,095 --> 00:38:27,387
That's three years maximum.

831
00:38:27,513 --> 00:38:28,930
Less if you're the one
who comes forward.

832
00:38:29,056 --> 00:38:30,015
We'll get you a deal.

833
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:31,850
You can't make that promise.
You're not the DA.

834
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:33,143
You'd rather
negotiate with Jason?

835
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:35,854
Because he'll kill you
and you know it.

836
00:38:37,023 --> 00:38:39,858
It was his idea. I didn't want to do it.
I didn't want to do it.

837
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:43,820
Okay. Get dressed.
You're coming with me. Go.

838
00:38:45,865 --> 00:38:48,074
Hey, by the way,
how did you get that bruise?

839
00:38:48,784 --> 00:38:50,952
Sometimes, the good guys
got to do bad things

840
00:38:51,078 --> 00:38:52,287
- to make the bad guys pay.
- To make the bad guys pay.

841
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:53,955
That's right.

842
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:59,502
- What?
- "What?"

843
00:38:59,628 --> 00:39:01,129
You should have
let me do the talking.

844
00:39:01,255 --> 00:39:02,464
Wouldn't work.
You're not ready, yet.

845
00:39:02,715 --> 00:39:04,716
Not ready?
This whole thing was my idea.

846
00:39:04,967 --> 00:39:07,010
You lost in housing court.

847
00:39:07,136 --> 00:39:08,219
You think you could
handle a murderer?

848
00:39:08,763 --> 00:39:10,680
Mississippi Burning.
You're welcome.

849
00:39:10,806 --> 00:39:12,098
I let you say
the juvenile thing.

850
00:39:12,475 --> 00:39:14,017
That was pretty badass,
wasn't it?

851
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:17,562
Really?
I thought I nailed it.

852
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:28,615
Shower girl.

853
00:39:32,578 --> 00:39:34,954
Hey, Mike. It's Rachel.

854
00:39:35,081 --> 00:39:36,122
I know I shouldn't
be doing this,

855
00:39:36,248 --> 00:39:37,999
and I know
you're seeing Jenny

856
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:41,503
but I can't stop
thinking about the kiss.

857
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:44,047
And I can't go back.

858
00:39:50,596 --> 00:39:52,639
Looks like one of them
up and confessed.

859
00:39:53,307 --> 00:39:56,351
We'll get your client out. I'll back
your motion to expunge his record.

860
00:39:56,477 --> 00:39:57,894
I'll facilitate his release.

861
00:40:00,147 --> 00:40:01,564
You don't seem very happy.

862
00:40:04,026 --> 00:40:07,070
You think I don't know you set those
boys up and coerced that whole thing?

863
00:40:07,196 --> 00:40:08,488
Set him up?
How would I do that?

864
00:40:08,614 --> 00:40:09,948
I don't know. What difference
does that make?

865
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:11,658
- I know you did it.
- You know?

866
00:40:11,784 --> 00:40:13,410
The same way you knew
Clifford was guilty?

867
00:40:13,869 --> 00:40:15,703
No. You don't
get to tell me

868
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:17,497
it's one way in court
and another out here.

869
00:40:17,623 --> 00:40:19,749
You can't prove it,
you don't know anything.

870
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,585
Well, you broke the law. Tell yourself
whatever you want.

871
00:40:22,711 --> 00:40:24,629
I'll tell myself
I got an innocent man out

872
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:26,798
and I put two
guilty ones in.

873
00:40:26,924 --> 00:40:28,800
Then, I'll close my eyes
and I'll sleep like a baby.

874
00:40:31,887 --> 00:40:33,096
One other thing.

875
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:37,934
You've got a little something
right over here.

876
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:41,020
I like you.

877
00:40:43,399 --> 00:40:44,899
By the way, how did you
make those guys

878
00:40:45,025 --> 00:40:46,860
think that they were
texting each other?

879
00:40:46,986 --> 00:40:48,653
I bought a prepaid phone.

880
00:40:48,779 --> 00:40:51,197
Set it to private. I texted each one
it was the other.

881
00:40:51,323 --> 00:40:52,949
- Who else would it be?
- You.

882
00:40:53,075 --> 00:40:54,909
Yeah, but they're not
going to think that.

883
00:40:55,035 --> 00:40:56,703
That's cool. You'd make
a good criminal.

884
00:40:56,829 --> 00:40:57,871
Yeah. Better than you.

885
00:40:57,997 --> 00:40:59,998
Uh, excuse me.
I was an amazing criminal.

886
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:02,750
You don't remember?
Briefcase popping open?

887
00:41:02,877 --> 00:41:03,710
Drugs spilling everywhere?

888
00:41:03,836 --> 00:41:04,961
Okay. That was
a mechanical failure,

889
00:41:05,087 --> 00:41:06,337
and that could have
happened to anybody.

890
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:08,006
Weed was all
over the floor.

891
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:10,008
Oh, shit! I forgot my phone again. Here,
can I borrow yours?

892
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:12,010
How do you have this memory and keep
forgetting your phone?

893
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:14,012
It's not the same thing.

894
00:41:18,225 --> 00:41:20,894
Trevor, it's Mike.
I need you to call me back.

895
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,814
Remember that thing
that I said could wait?

896
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:26,983
It can't anymore.

897
00:41:27,526 --> 00:41:29,861
There's something
I've got to tell you.

898
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:39,162
Ms. Pearson. I'm Trevor Evans.
I'm a friend of Mike Ross.

899
00:41:40,289 --> 00:41:41,164
Yes?

900
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:43,416
I wish I didn't
have to do this.

901
00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:47,587
There's something you need to
know about him.

902
00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:51,716
Something Harvey Specter
hasn't told you.

903
00:41:54,637 --> 00:41:56,137
What is it?
