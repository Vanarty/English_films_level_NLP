1
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,040
This way, madam.

2
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:47,560
At the end of the bar.

3
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,720
-Hello.
-Hello, Porchey!

4
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:59,480
-You found the place all right?
-The taxi driver did, yes.

5
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,400
Of course. Wonderful.

6
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,280
Lord Porchester.

7
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,600
Ladies.

8
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,920
Is it just me,
or is this place faintly ridiculous?

9
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,680
Two of my great hates in life,
fine dining and central London.

10
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,280
I just thought it's the kind
of special occasion place one came

11
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:33,120
if one had a special question to ask.

12
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,800
At this moment I wish I were a poet,
not a horse-breeder.

13
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,720
Will you marry me?

14
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,880
Oh, Porchey.

15
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:06,480
-That sounds like a "no."
-No, it's not a "no".

16
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,520
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no.

17
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:14,400
-That's... 12 no's.
-I would love to.

18
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,320
On one condition.

19
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,680
That you don't still hold a torch for her.

20
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,040
Who?

21
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,640
Oh. Her.

22
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:38,240
I know how close you were,
and how close your families still are.

23
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:41,040
It's true. She and I, we are close.

24
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,560
I was close to her father.
I am close to her sister.

25
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,360
Our families are close.

26
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,960
In many ways, and I speak as a breeder
myself, it would have been a good match.

27
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,080
- Perfect match.
- I won't deny it.

28
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,400
<i>Except for the fact</i>
<i>it was never on the cards.</i>

29
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,640
For her, there was only ever Philip.

30
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,840
And for you?

31
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,720
There's only you.

32
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,640
Lilibet?

33
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:55,320
Right you are, Jock.
Yes, I'll let him know. Thank you.

34
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:58,800
I'm sure he'll be delighted. Bye.

35
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,200
Are you winning?

36
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:15,360
No. There was one, brief,
tantalizing moment

37
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:20,720
when I thought I had it.
I moved in for the kill.

38
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:25,880
But then one wrong brushstroke
and it got away once again.

39
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,800
I've just been talking to Jock
about your 80th birthday.

40
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,520
No, don't mention it.

41
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,800
Because it happens on the same day
as the opening of Parliament,

42
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,320
they've decided to combine events

43
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:40,600
and hold a reception in your honor
at the Great Hall.

44
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,240
Oh, that's very nice.

45
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:45,040
Oh, and it's going to be
Graham Sutherland.

46
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,160
-Who?
-The painter.

47
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,400
-To paint your portrait.
-What portrait?

48
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:54,720
It's the official portrait commissioned
by both Houses. It's your present.

49
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,480
Sutherland? Never heard of him.

50
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,360
He's got quite the reputation.
He's a modernist.

51
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:06,000
Oh. Not sure I can trust a modernist
with an English name.

52
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:10,360
Give me a German modernist. Or an Italian.

53
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,640
They're the ones
who have to start all over again.

54
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,040
Whatever would an Englishman
want to change?

55
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:39,720
<i>It's grand to be home again</i>
<i>after so long an absence.</i>

56
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:45,160
The surgeon who operated on me
told me yesterday that all was well.

57
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:50,880
I'll need to have a further period
of convalescence, put on some weight,

58
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,760
but there is nothing else to worry about.

59
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:56,840
As I said, it's grand to be home again.

60
00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:00,760
I look forward to being back at work
just as soon as possible.

61
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,440
Thank you!

62
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,440
Thank you!

63
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:24,600
-Hello?
-Porchey? I hope I'm not disturbing.

64
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:27,080
-Goodness.
-Am I disturbing?

65
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,760
-No.
-Good.

66
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,680
It's Aureole.
I think we're making a mistake.

67
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:39,080
<i>-I think we should lead from the start.</i>
-And I think you're wrong.

68
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:41,560
But we both know
he doesn't hold up naturally.

69
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:45,040
We tried holding him up
against Darius before. And Darius won.

70
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,160
That was the Guineas, which is a mile.

71
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,120
This is the King George.
A mile and a half.

72
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,160
What will we do
if he plays up before the race?

73
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:58,240
He always plays up. That's who he is.

74
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,000
You don't seem the slightest bit worried.

75
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,280
<i>Anything else?</i>

76
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:08,000
Well, can I just say one more time,
for the record...

77
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,200
I think we should start fast,
and run at a good clip.

78
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,800
-Noted.
-I am right sometimes, you know.

79
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,800
Even you said yourself
that I have good instincts.

80
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:23,520
You do.
And I might well live to regret it.

81
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:29,320
-That, and a good many other things.
-Oh, dear. Such as?

82
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,880
Good night.

83
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,120
<i>Mr. Sutherland, Prime Minister.</i>

84
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,000
-Good morning.
-How do you do?

85
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,160
-Good morning, hello. How do you do?
-Good morning.

86
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:16,880
-How do you do, sir? It's an honor.
-No, no. The honor is mine.

87
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,880
So, where do you want me?

88
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:34,360
So, will we be engaged
in flattery or reality?

89
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:37,680
Are you going to paint me
as a cherub or a bulldog?

90
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,400
I imagine there are a great number
of Mr. Churchills.

91
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,200
Yes, indeed there are.

92
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:46,240
Well, as you search for him,

93
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,920
perhaps I can implore you
not to feel the need to be too accurate.

94
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:55,120
-Why? Accuracy is truth.
-No. For accuracy, we have the camera.

95
00:10:55,960 --> 00:11:01,840
Painting is the higher art.
I paint a bit myself, you know.

96
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,600
Yes, sir, I know.

97
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,960
And I never let accuracy get in the way
of truth if I don't want it to.

98
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:15,800
If I see some landscape I like, and I wish
there wasn't a factory in the background,

99
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,520
I leave the factory out.

100
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:26,000
So, Mr. Sutherland, tell me,
I'm fascinated. What is your process?

101
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,640
First, I shall take some photographs,

102
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:34,200
they'll be useful as reference
when I get back to the studio.

103
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:37,760
Then I shall do some charcoal sketches,
studies of the head, the hands

104
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:40,000
and then I'll work those sketches up.

105
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:49,280
The actual painting up
will be done in my studio at home.

106
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:53,400
-Is this... Do you mind?
-Perfectly all right. Carry on.

107
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:59,240
Well, what pose are you thinking of?

108
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,280
Seated.

109
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:10,480
I could try standing?
It might be more commanding. Dynamic.

110
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,280
It might make me look younger.

111
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,800
I thought the painting was supposed
to celebrate reaching a certain age?

112
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,480
Four score years, Winston.

113
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:27,080
-I think seated is more senatorial.
-Oh, senatorial.

114
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,680
What nonsense.

115
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,680
Yes, I agree.

116
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,160
Cigar or no cigar?

117
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,160
No cigar.

118
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:50,640
-Garter robes or no garter robes?
-No finery.

119
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,040
No grandiosity.

120
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:56,760
Dressed merely as a parliamentarian.

121
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,680
How prosaic.

122
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,120
-I liked him.
-Yes, I could tell.

123
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:09,240
You were smitten,
blushing like a little girl.

124
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:13,800
-Well, he is rather a wow.
-A "wow"?

125
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:18,240
Tall and handsome, saturnine.
A bit of a Heathcliff.

126
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,400
He wants total control.

127
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,760
Well, any artist worth anything
would insist on that.

128
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:26,120
-You don't really want a flatterer.
-Yes, I do.

129
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:29,920
No, you don't.
Besides, it's manifestly clear he's a fan.

130
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,680
Oh, no, don't be silly.
You can smell the socialism on him.

131
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,080
Even the socialists
acknowledge you saved the country.

132
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,880
Through gritted teeth.

133
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:41,880
I have the protective instincts
of a loving wife

134
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,640
and I can tell you
this one is not an assassin.

135
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,720
Oh, whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa.
Look. Look at this.

136
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:03,520
<i>It's Aureole, the Queen's Aureole,</i>
<i>the Queen's horse, followed by...</i>

137
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,600
Isn't he marvelous?

138
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,160
Isn't he clever?

139
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,760
You were absolutely... No.

140
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,000
No, he won.

141
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,400
You were absolutely right.

142
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,320
-He's so clever!
-I know. I know.

143
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:39,120
-What a champion.
-What a champion.

144
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,560
-Good boy.
-Hello.

145
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:55,240
I remember getting the phone call
from your father.

146
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:59,440
When he was born.
By Hyperion and out of Angelola.

147
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:02,120
Yes, we gave him his first milk.
Do you remember?

148
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,640
Watching him grow up, everyone thought
his elder brother would be the star.

149
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,280
Your clever Papa
always had an instinct for this one.

150
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,080
-He's the underdog.
-And he backed him.

151
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:17,080
-And an underdog became a star.
-Yes, and his favorite horse.

152
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,880
So, what's next for our champion?

153
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:27,200
Well, we have received an invitation
to the Laurel International.

154
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:29,640
-America?
-Yes, next month.

155
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:35,400
He's what, four?
Already at the older end of the spectrum.

156
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:40,040
-If you were asking my opinion...
-That is why I asked you here today.

157
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:44,760
My honest advice,
I'd consider retiring him now.

158
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,520
At the top of his game.

159
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:50,640
The best middle distance horse in Europe,
with a sky-high market value.

160
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,120
Let him earn you
some proper money as a stud.

161
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:59,920
I'm surprised to hear you turning down
the opportunity of going to America.

162
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,440
Why?

163
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:04,680
Well, that's where your girlfriend's from,
isn't it?

164
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:09,640
-Fiancé.
-Fiancé? Goodness.

165
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:15,840
Who is she? Money, I hope.
So you can keep up the stables.

166
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,720
-Actually, she's a Portsmouth.
-Oh, dear. So no money.

167
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:23,720
Some money. But horse mad.
Well, she'd have to be.

168
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,280
You'd approve, I think.

169
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:31,360
-Well, can I meet her?
-If you promise you won't scare her.

170
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,560
-Why would I scare her?
-You're the Queen!

171
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:36,080
-Only some of the time.
-All the time.

172
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,560
And that makes you terrifying.
And she's heard a lot about you.

173
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:45,720
-From whom?
-From me. Some of it nice, too.

174
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,560
Oh, the one you let get away.

175
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:28,480
-What?
-He's always carried a torch for you.

176
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:32,000
Porchey? Utter nonsense.

177
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,880
He told me himself.
One night while in his cups.

178
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,880
That doesn't count.

179
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:43,120
When a man's had a drink,
that's when the truth comes out.

180
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:48,200
No. That's when the nonsense comes out.
Besides, we have interests in common.

181
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,960
Horses aren't an interest to you.
They're a passion.

182
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:55,280
-A passion your husband doesn't share.
-He has other passions.

183
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,200
So I hear.

184
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,440
-Sir.
-Good morning.

185
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,320
The Foreign Secretary is here, sir.
Shall I show him in?

186
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,760
No.

187
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,640
Not here.

188
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,640
Sorry to keep you waiting.

189
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,640
As apposite as ever.

190
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,760
I didn't mean it like that.

191
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:05,560
-There's ugliness in the air, Anthony.
-I have nothing of beauty to say.

192
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:10,440
Then say what you must,
deposit your ugliness and go.

193
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:13,160
I have more important things to do.

194
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,520
Very well.

195
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,320
At some point,

196
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:29,400
every leader must ask himself
whether by staying in office,

197
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,680
he is giving to the country,

198
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:35,920
or taking from it. Helping or harming.

199
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:41,080
And I would suggest
that for some time now,

200
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:45,000
you have been taking and harming.

201
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:50,320
And therefore I come to you, in the name
of the party and of the country,

202
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,440
for the very last time, Winston,

203
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:59,120
-to bid you to stand down.
-I will in good time. The right time.

204
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,880
The right time was nine years ago
when you lost us the election.

205
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:06,240
And I have since avenged that defeat
by winning us the last election.

206
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,920
I won us that, Winston! I won that!

207
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:17,680
People voted Conservative
in the clear expectation

208
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,760
-that you would give way to me.
-That is such rubbish!

209
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:24,760
They voted Conservative
because they couldn't stomach socialism!

210
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:27,640
Inflation is out of control.

211
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:32,640
And with every misjudgment,
with every miscalculation,

212
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:37,240
with every utterance you make, that
appetite to return to the left is growing!

213
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,800
Be careful, Anthony,

214
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:42,360
too much excitement is not good
for one so soon after an operation.

215
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:46,160
Spoken by a man who
only two months ago was effectively dead.

216
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,960
-Which makes two of us.
-I have recovered.

217
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:54,880
That's not what I hear. I hear
you are a shadow of your former self.

218
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,120
That when you walk,
the pills rattle around inside of you!

219
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:01,840
I have something
that you will never see again.

220
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:07,200
-A clean bill of health.
-Stalin said the same.

221
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:10,600
He died groveling on the floor!

222
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,080
Mr. Sutherland is here.

223
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:16,680
-Hello, Anthony.
-Anthony was just leaving.

224
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,440
Hello, Clemmie.

225
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Yes, I was... just leaving.

226
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,440
Here we are.

227
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,400
Morning.

228
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,880
-Morning.
-Sir, this is my wife, Kathleen.

229
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,240
She assists me sometimes.
I hope you don't mind.

230
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,040
Over here.

231
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:17,600
-What's that you're using?
-Pencil.

232
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,040
Yeah. But which kind?

233
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:23,920
4B or 6B, not sure.

234
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,680
It's a 6B.

235
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,640
- And on what paper?
- Drawing paper.

236
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,040
I favor heavy-weight cotton,
cold pressed, deckle edged.

237
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,840
Sized with gelatin.

238
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:47,560
How many paintings does your husband
complete in a year, Mrs. Sutherland?

239
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,760
Three or four.

240
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:52,760
Would you care to guess
how many I average?

241
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:57,280
-Ten? 15?
-60!

242
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:03,080
Of course, I'm just a hobbyist,
an enthusiast.

243
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:05,680
Not a major artist like your husband.

244
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:10,200
Taking his time.

245
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,200
Over here.

246
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:46,920
I did a little reading about you,
Mr. Sutherland, after our last session.

247
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,760
-Did you?
-Yeah. Quite interesting.

248
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:53,880
From what I read, this is all
very new to you, this portraiture.

249
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:57,120
I don't think anyone starts out
wanting to be a portraitist.

250
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:01,640
Yeah. But in your search for your métier,
you've tried a bit of everything.

251
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:06,400
That's true.
I came to painting quite late.

252
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,520
And now that you've found it,
you'll never leave it, yes?

253
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,720
Yeah. I quite understand.

254
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:31,440
How is it, Mrs. Sutherland?

255
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,000
It has truth.

256
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,600
-Am I to be allowed a peek?
-No.

257
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:42,840
Well, why not? I could give you advice.

258
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:46,760
After all,
I know this face better than you do.

259
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:50,440
If you've made the neck too thick
or the arms too long, I can tell you.

260
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:54,920
I find in general people have
very little understanding of who they are.

261
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,360
One has to turn a blind eye to so much
of oneself in order to get through life.

262
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:01,720
And you see it as your responsibility
to bring all that out into the open?

263
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,320
Certainly. The good as well as the bad.

264
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:06,880
Just concentrate on the good,
and all will be well.

265
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,800
You're not just painting me, you know.

266
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:13,400
You're painting the Prime Minister
of the United Kingdom of Great Britain

267
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:16,520
and Northern Ireland, and everything
that great office represents.

268
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,200
Democracy. Freedom.

269
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:24,160
The highest ideals of government
and leadership. Just remember that.

270
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:38,040
-Yes?
<i>-Lord Porchester, Your Majesty.</i>

271
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,440
-Thank you.
<i>-Plug in.</i>

272
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:42,760
-Porchey?
-What a palaver.

273
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:45,240
<i>-What is?</i>
-Getting through to you.

274
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:49,440
<i>I picked up the phone to you just after</i>
<i>nine this morning. It's now gone midday.</i>

275
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:53,120
Oh, don't exaggerate.
But, yes, I know, it is infuriating.

276
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,240
Fire away.

277
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:57,120
You asked me to come up with some figures
for you with regard to Aureole.

278
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,360
Although I'm numerically dyslexic,
runs in the family I'm afraid,

279
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,440
like the high forehead.

280
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,880
<i>I have done the sums,</i>
<i>see if this helps you with your decision.</i>

281
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,160
In the course of his lifetime
as a racehorse,

282
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:10,200
Aureole has made you
just over 40,000 pounds.

283
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,960
Goodness.

284
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:15,440
<i>But if you were to put him out to stud,</i>
<i>he could make you far more.</i>

285
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:18,160
<i>He's a recognized champion,</i>
<i>with a top-notch pedigree.</i>

286
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,120
<i>You could stand him at Wolferton Stud</i>
<i>for top dollar.</i>

287
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,960
Well, that's a decision then.

288
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:27,960
Good.

289
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:32,040
And in the meantime,
I'll ask if I can get you a direct line.

290
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:35,240
-To you?
-Yes, to me. Why?

291
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:37,400
Was there anyone else
you wanted to speak to here?

292
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:40,440
-No.
<i>-Good.</i>

293
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,800
What is it, "top dollar?" I need numbers.

294
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:51,400
-400.
-A pop? A shot?

295
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:54,040
Sorry, I'm trying to find a less
onomatopoeic expression for...

296
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,760
-I know what it is.
-A shag.

297
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,120
A cover.

298
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:02,360
-A cover?
-Yes, that's the correct term for...

299
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:05,040
-A horse hump?
-Yes.

300
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:09,360
So, what might you earn then
over the course of the year?

301
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:14,480
Well, in one year alone,
Aureole might cover 40 mares.

302
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:18,600
-Making about 16,000 pounds.
-Good for him.

303
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:23,360
In the course of his lifetime at the stud,
he might sire 500, 600 foals,

304
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,880
making me over 200,000 pounds.

305
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:28,560
Creating an entire generation
of offspring.

306
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,640
-Yes.
-Father to all the foals in our stables.

307
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,440
And any other stable
that could afford him.

308
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,720
Yes.

309
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:39,200
Oh, I see,
so in time, every horse out there

310
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:43,560
could somehow be related to Aureole.

311
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:48,040
-Yes, I suppose so.
-Like old man Carnarvon.

312
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:50,520
Who?

313
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,160
Your friend Porchey's father.

314
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:57,280
-Porchey?
-No, like I said, his father.

315
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:01,080
-Yes, they're both called Porchey.
-Wasn't that the rumor?

316
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:05,160
-What rumor?
-Well, that he'd had so many affairs,

317
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:08,920
an entire generation of
British aristocrats was related to him.

318
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:14,080
An illegitimate "Porchey"
in every great house in the land.

319
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,320
High foreheads everywhere.

320
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,400
-And numerical dyslexia.
-What?

321
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,360
-Nothing.
-What?

322
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,440
Nothing!

323
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,880
Michael!

324
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,120
Dear boy!

325
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:39,040
- Good night.
- Good night.

326
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:43,160
Let me have a look at you.

327
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,560
-Marvelous.
-Shall we?

328
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,720
Come on. You look beautiful.

329
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,880
-How is he?
-Not too bad, sir. This way.

330
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,840
-Morning.
-Morning.

331
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:49,400
-No wife this time?
-No.

332
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:53,320
I asked her not to come.

333
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:01,720
Since this is to be our final session,
I wanted us to be all alone.

334
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:11,360
-In silence preferably.
-Yes. Yes. I'll be a good boy.

335
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:21,440
I quite understand
the need for concentration.

336
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:26,760
Painting a picture is like
fighting a battle. A bloody battle.

337
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:32,480
In the gladiatorial fight to the death,
the artist either wins or loses.

338
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:37,680
-Are you winning?
-I hope so.

339
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,120
Do you think I'll like it?

340
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:44,920
I think that's possibly too much
to ask for.

341
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,360
But I do take comfort from the fact

342
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:51,040
that your own work
is so honest and revealing.

343
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:54,600
Oh, thank you for the compliment.

344
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:03,880
Well, are there any works
that you're referring to in particular?

345
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:07,440
I was thinking especially
of the Goldfish pond here at Chartwell.

346
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:14,200
-The pond? Why the pond? It's just a pond.
-It's very much more than that.

347
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:17,600
As borne out by the fact that you've
returned to it again and again.

348
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:18,680
More than 20 times.

349
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:22,080
Well, yes,
because it's such a technical challenge.

350
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:26,120
-It eludes me.
-Well, perhaps you elude yourself, sir.

351
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:29,320
That's why it's more revealing
than a self-portrait.

352
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,680
Oh, that's nonsense.

353
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:35,600
It's the water, the play of light.

354
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:40,480
The trickery. The fish, down below.

355
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:42,320
I think all our work
is unintentionally revealing

356
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,840
and I find it especially so
with your pond.

357
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:48,800
Beneath the tranquility and the elegance
and the light playing on the surface,

358
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:52,720
I saw honesty and pain, terrible pain.

359
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:56,560
The framing itself,
indicated to me that you wanted us

360
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:59,440
to see something

361
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:03,320
beneath all the muted colors,
deep down in the water.

362
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:09,960
Terrible despair. Hiding like a Leviathan.
Like a sea monster.

363
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:14,640
-You saw all that?
-Yes, I did.

364
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,160
Perhaps that says more about you than me?

365
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,680
Mm-hmm.

366
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:21,840
Perhaps.

367
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:27,840
May I ask you a question, Mr. Sutherland?

368
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,080
Hmm.

369
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:34,520
It's about one of your paintings.
The one you call "Pastoral."

370
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:38,640
With all that gnarled and twisted wood.

371
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:42,240
Those great ugly dabs of black.

372
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:47,960
I found something malevolent in it.

373
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:49,720
Where did that come from?

374
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:56,160
Well, that's very perceptive.
That was a very dark time. My...

375
00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:02,720
My son, John, passed away,
aged two months.

376
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:10,080
Oh, my. I am sorry.

377
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,480
Yes. Thank you.

378
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,840
-You have five, yes?
-Four.

379
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:41,520
Marigold was the fifth.

380
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:47,840
She left us at age two years, nine months.
Septicemia.

381
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:50,760
I'm so sorry. I had no idea.

382
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:57,080
We settled on the name Marigold,

383
00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:01,560
on account of her wonderful golden curls.

384
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:04,000
The most extraordinary color.

385
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:09,880
Regretfully,
but though perhaps mercifully,

386
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:13,880
I was not present when she died.

387
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:16,960
When I came home, Clemmie...

388
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:21,800
roared like a wounded animal.

389
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:34,720
We bought Chartwell
a year after Marigold died.

390
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,400
That was when I put in the...

391
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,680
the pond.

392
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:10,080
Here.

393
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:13,760
Thank you.

394
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:28,520
Well, thank you.

395
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,440
It was a pleasure.

396
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:39,280
I look forward to seeing it.

397
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:22,200
-Hello.
-Hello.

398
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:24,880
-Shall we?
-Yes.

399
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:31,680
Given this is Aureole's debut,
and we want to leave nothing to chance,

400
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:34,040
I've called up three different mares.

401
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:37,800
Very rarely does a forced tryst
make a fruitful tryst.

402
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,120
If one wants the perfect foal,

403
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,720
one needs to be prepared
to wait for the perfect pairing.

404
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:42,840
Shall we?

405
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:46,160
-Meet Neocracy.
-Oh, the Aga Khan's horse.

406
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,120
-Indeed.
-Yes.

407
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,520
Recently retired
with a good record as a winner.

408
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,880
Lovely temperament, too.

409
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,160
My only concern would be,

410
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:55,640
-is she perhaps a little too...
-Bashful?

411
00:37:56,520 --> 00:38:00,240
I'm worried that if we left these two
to it, nothing would ever happen.

412
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,640
Which is why I've also called up
Turkish Blood.

413
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:06,040
-An altogether different proposition.
-Indeed.

414
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:08,760
Strong, willful,
with a terrific track record herself.

415
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:12,520
It really would be breeding
the best with the best.

416
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,080
I'm sensing a "but".

417
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:17,480
From memory, your Aureole
is something of a sensitive soul.

418
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:20,120
I'd hate him to be intimidated
or come unstuck

419
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:22,240
when faced with a fiery warrior like this.

420
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,960
Very considerate of you, Porchey.

421
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:26,760
Which is why I have a good feeling
about our third candidate.

422
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:29,200
Feast your eyes on Temple Bar.

423
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:32,080
A hot thoroughbred
with a winning streak herself.

424
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:35,480
She's a little on the young side, perhaps.
Just three.

425
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:37,360
We don't mind that, do we?

426
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:46,320
-Immediate engagement.
-Yes. I must say, I do like this one.

427
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,720
It would appear the feeling is mutual.

428
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:53,400
You're lovely.

429
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:56,680
<i>Telegrams have been pouring</i>
<i>into Downing Street today</i>

430
00:38:56,760 --> 00:39:00,360
<i>to wish Sir Winston Churchill,</i>
<i>a happy 80th birthday</i>

431
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:02,920
<i>on this the 30th of November.</i>

432
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,200
<i>They come from all...</i>

433
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:12,480
Happy birthday, my darling old pug.

434
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,720
-Oh, is it time?
-It is, Ma'am.

435
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:06,880
Right.

436
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,240
-Do sit down, Michael.
-Thank you, Ma'am.

437
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:19,960
<i>Westminster Hall, silent witness</i>
<i>of nearly a thousand years of history,</i>

438
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:23,640
<i>was the scene of the birthday</i>
<i>presentations to Sir Winston.</i>

439
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:20,320
I am deeply honored to be here today.

440
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:23,400
No politician

441
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:26,560
has ever received such an honor before.

442
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:29,320
And I am deeply grateful.

443
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,680
<i>I am aware, however,</i>

444
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:34,560
<i>that after having served my country,</i>

445
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:39,080
for 54 of my 80 years...

446
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:43,760
"resignation"...

447
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:48,880
is a word that hangs in the air.

448
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:53,520
And indeed,
it is the perfect occasion for it,

449
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:58,000
and the stage is set
and the audience is assembled,

450
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:03,600
all ready for a grand valediction.

451
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:07,440
There's only one problem,
the lead actor has forgotten his lines.

452
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:14,080
And instead of standing down,
he is taking an encore.

453
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:19,080
Oh, dear, he's playing with them all.

454
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:23,080
When your political colleagues
are kind enough

455
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:28,440
to present you with a portrait
by an ambitious modernist...

456
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:32,200
one has to ask oneself,

457
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:36,120
"Is it a gift, or is it a curse?"

458
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:46,800
Mr. Sutherland, the artist, and I

459
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:49,920
spoke a great deal during my sittings.

460
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,840
I reminded him of the stakes involved.

461
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:56,960
That his portrait was not just of me,

462
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:00,960
but of the office I represent.

463
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:04,720
Indeed,
of our entire system of government.

464
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:08,680
So, at long last,

465
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:12,400
I look forward to unveiling this painting.

466
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:47,720
A fine, patriotic piece of modern art.

467
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:22,320
<i>Why are you here?</i>

468
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:25,080
I understand you've rejected the painting.

469
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:28,040
-I have.
-On what grounds?

470
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:31,360
That is not a painting.
It's a humiliation!

471
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:35,400
"How shall I paint him today?"

472
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:39,200
"Ah! Sitting on a chair,
producing a stool."

473
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:45,600
"A broken, sagging, pitiful creature,
squeezing and squeezing!"

474
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:49,080
-That's not how it's being seen.
-That is how it is.

475
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:52,840
-And I will not accept it.
-I don't think it's wise to reject it.

476
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:55,640
It was commissioned by the members
of the joint Houses of Parliament

477
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:56,720
as a sign of respect.

478
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:59,840
Well, then they should have commissioned
an artist who is respectful,

479
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:03,600
instead of a Judas
wielding his murderous brush.

480
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:07,800
Look at it!
It is a betrayal of friendship.

481
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:10,400
And an unpatriotic, treacherous,

482
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:14,400
cowardly assault
by the individualistic left.

483
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:17,080
-As regards the friendship...
-Clearly there is none.

484
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:21,760
I accepted this commission
because I admired you

485
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:24,520
and I came through the experience
admiring you even more.

486
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:26,680
You make monsters of everyone you admire?

487
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:32,200
It's not vindictive.
It's art. It's not personal.

488
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:36,440
Well, you are a lost soul.

489
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:38,920
A narcissist without direction
or certainty.

490
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:43,960
Please, sir.
Don't overreact. Give it time.

491
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:46,000
I showed those sketches
to your wife throughout.

492
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:49,040
-She remarked on how accurate they were.
-That is the whole point.

493
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:52,400
It is not a reasonably
truthful image of me!

494
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:55,400
-It is, sir.
-It is not! It is cruel!

495
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:57,400
Age is cruel!

496
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:05,520
If you see decay,
it's because there's decay.

497
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:08,080
If you see frailty,
it's because there's frailty.

498
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:12,040
I can't be blamed for what is.

499
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:17,400
And I refuse to hide
and disguise what I see.

500
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:24,560
If you're engaged in a fight with
something, then it's not with me.

501
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:31,560
It's with your own blindness.

502
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:43,600
I think you should go.

503
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:26,280
<i>He's right.</i>

504
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:31,960
-What?
-I am that man in the painting.

505
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:36,640
<i>Wretched and decaying.</i>

506
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:40,800
-I cannot go on.
-You've said that before.

507
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:47,400
<i>This time I mean it. I'm tired.</i>

508
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:52,600
You've had enough?

509
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:56,280
<i>I have, my love.</i>

510
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:02,680
This time I really have.

511
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:05,120
Good.

512
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:47,880
Of course, I knew it was coming.

513
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:53,160
And if I'm being frank,
there were one or two moments

514
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:55,080
when I might have even hoped for it, too.

515
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:57,960
Prayed, no doubt.

516
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:07,880
You really have been the most remarkable
servant to your country.

517
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:12,400
-Thank you, Ma'am.
-No, Winston, on behalf of us all...

518
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:14,720
thank you.

519
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:21,880
-And you wish for Mr. Eden to take over?
-I do.

520
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:24,040
Well, that will make him happy.

521
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:28,880
For a day or two,
he might even stop cursing me.

522
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:33,760
Then he will be overwhelmed by a job
in which no man can ever succeed,

523
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:36,800
and curse me again for leaving it to him.

524
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:41,320
It might be an idea not to tell him that
before he starts.

525
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:42,440
No, Ma'am.

526
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:46,400
So...

527
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:50,440
This is our last audience?

528
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:00,120
Yes.

529
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:06,360
However will I cope without you?

530
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:09,440
You will be fine, Ma'am.

531
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:16,600
I have nothing more to teach you.
Which is why it's time for me to leave.

532
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:27,480
Your Majesty.

533
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:18,320
Stop.

534
00:51:57,840 --> 00:52:01,040
Renaming London Airport?

535
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:04,200
I want something more personal
for Winston.

536
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:08,600
What about dinner?

537
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:11,760
-Here? Or Buckingham Palace?
-No, there.

538
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:13,760
-Downing Street?
-Yes.

539
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:17,640
It would be quite the compliment.
You and Philip go there for dinner.

540
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:20,400
I'll ask Philip.

541
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:23,200
-No, you'll tell Philip.
-Mummy.

542
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:27,120
Dinner? Downing Street?
Oh, God! Why not?

543
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:30,800
Is she a looker, do you think?

544
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:35,440
I mean, if I were a stallion,
would I fancy her?

545
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:39,880
Attraction isn't so much about looks
as smell.

546
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:43,200
-Oh, I see. Well, does she smell good?
-Well, we'll see, won't we?

547
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:46,800
Come on. Come on.

548
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:54,720
Rather like us, darling,
when we were courting.

549
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:57,400
- Gently, gently, come on.
- Shh. Will you please be quiet?

550
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:01,560
- Yeah, look. There we go!
- All right.

551
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:03,320
All right.

552
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:09,200
- Hold her steady.
- Steady.

553
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:14,400
Oi, oi. I'll say.

554
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:21,080
Back off.

555
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:24,680
-Yes, there we go.
-Good girl.

556
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:26,680
Good boy.

557
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:29,000
Is that it?

558
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:33,240
2,000 guineas for that?

559
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:37,160
As long as he's done what he needs to do,
and it bears fruit, I don't mind.

560
00:53:37,240 --> 00:53:39,240
Well done, Porchey!

561
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:45,040
Yes, indeed. Well done, Porchey.

562
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:47,520
I hear he's been given a direct line.

563
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:48,720
-Who?
-Porchey.

564
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:50,400
So he can call straight in.

565
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:52,920
I know only because I tried to
get one for Mike and was refused.

566
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:55,480
Yes.

567
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:57,680
On account of him
not being a family member.

568
00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:00,840
-Porchey is like family.
-Is he?

569
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:03,760
Yes. Part of the furniture.

570
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:08,160
Well, as long as you don't sit on him
anytime soon.

571
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:22,000
-Well, that all seemed to go well.
-Yes, it did, didn't it?

572
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:25,080
Are you all right?

573
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:28,800
Mm.

574
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:55,480
- Can you leave us now, please?
- Yes, Ma'am.

575
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:14,560
I have nothing to hide from you. Nothing.

576
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:18,920
Porchey is a friend.

577
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:25,720
And yes, there are those
who would have preferred me to marry him.

578
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:28,640
Indeed, marriage with him
might have been easier.

579
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:32,520
Might have even worked better than ours.

580
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:38,240
But to everyone's regret
and frustration...

581
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:42,600
the only person I have ever loved is you.

582
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:49,160
And can you honestly look me in the eye
and say the same?

583
00:55:58,320 --> 00:55:59,360
Can you?

584
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:17,720
Pray silence for Her Majesty, the Queen.

585
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:28,360
My Lords, Ladies and Gentlemen.

586
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:31,400
Dear Winston and Lady Churchill.

587
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:40,280
My confidence in Sir Anthony is complete.

588
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:43,680
And I know he will lead the country
on to great achievements,

589
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:50,640
but it would be useless to pretend
that either he or any of those successors

590
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:53,400
who may one day follow him in office,

591
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:55,600
will ever, for me,

592
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:59,680
be able to hold the place
of my first Prime Minister,

593
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:02,640
to whom my husband and I owe so much.

594
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:08,360
And for whose wise guidance,
during the early years of my reign,

595
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:12,040
I shall always be so profoundly grateful.

596
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:13,280
Hear, hear!

597
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:22,640
I will remember you always
for your magnanimity,

598
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,200
your courage at all times.

599
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:35,120
And for your unfailing humor.

600
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:39,680
Founded in your unrivalled mastery
of the English language.

601
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:48,000
<i>I take comfort from the fact, that</i>
<i>in losing my constitutional adviser...</i>

602
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:52,360
<i>I gain a wise counsellor...</i>

603
00:57:55,480 --> 00:57:58,720
to whom I shall look
for help and support...

604
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:01,680
in the days which lie ahead.

605
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:11,600
- May there be many of them.
- Hear, hear.
