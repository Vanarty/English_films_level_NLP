1
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:19,480
"My husband and I are deeply touched
by our welcome here."

2
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,680
-Ma'am?
-Yes. How long do we have?

3
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,040
We land in ten minutes.

4
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:24,920
No. Martin.

5
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,200
-Will there be a microphone?
-I'm sure, ma'am.

6
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:30,120
"Little more than 50 years ago..."

7
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,680
[brass band plays]

8
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:11,400
"My husband and I are deeply touched
by our welcome here this morning.

9
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,280
Little more than 50 years ago,
Nairobi was a savage place,

10
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:19,800
the home of wild animals
and uninhabited

11
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:23,320
except for the occasional band
of nomadic herdsmen.

12
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,600
Now, it is a modern, vibrant city,

13
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:29,680
a striking tribute
to the men and women of all races,

14
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,800
who have made it a great center
of commerce and finance.

15
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:37,240
Now, it remains only for me
to pass on the apologies

16
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,520
of my father, King George..."

17
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:51,000
Who is, no doubt, very jealous indeed
that I have come in his place.

18
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,080
He's getting stronger every day.

19
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,800
And he will be here
with you all again very soon.

20
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:06,200
Your Royal Highness, may I present

21
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:09,960
Senior Chief Waruhiu wa Kung'u
of the Kikuyu.

22
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:12,760
-Hello.
-Chief Sironka of the Kipsigis.

23
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,840
-Hello.
-Good morning.

24
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,240
-Lembui of the Maasai.
-Yes, hello.

25
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,400
-Pelipel of the Turkana.
-Such a pleasure.

26
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,760
Oh, gosh, look, I've got that one,
and that one, actually.

27
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,520
Oh, Christ, I've got that one too.
Look!

28
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,640
Oh, come off it, where did you steal
that one from, eh?

29
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,520
Independence is sweeping
across the continent.

30
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,840
Their support is important
more than ever.

31
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,000
-Yes, thank you.
-Oh, like the hat.

32
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:45,640
It's not a hat. It's a crown.

33
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,920
Breathe in, Your Majesty.

34
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,840
And out.

35
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,800
Well, well.

36
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,840
I tell you, I woke up this morning
feeling like a new man.

37
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,040
I think you should enjoy it, sir.

38
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,720
Enjoy every minute while you can.

39
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,760
Well, I intend to.

40
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:43,480
And I'll head straight to Sandringham
if you give me the all-clear to shoot.

41
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,920
Consider it given.

42
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,560
-[bell ringing]
-[horn beeping]

43
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:57,320
-Sorry, ma'am, can I help you?
-Oh, Venetia Scott. I'm new.

44
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:01,520
It's all right. She's with me.
Come along. Thank you.

45
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,560
-He's awake.
-Yes, sir.

46
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,880
Actually, he's asked to see you.

47
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:24,000
Oh. [grunts]

48
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,920
Uh... Um...

49
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,960
-Prime Minister?
-[Churchill] Is that the new girl?

50
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:49,360
-Yes, sir. Venetia.
-Louisa?

51
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,240
-Venetia.
-Venetia.

52
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:57,000
Have they told you terrible things,
your colleagues downstairs?

53
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,000
Go on. Be candid.

54
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:05,440
It is said... you can be difficult.

55
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,800
I can be a monster.
Did they say that?

56
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:10,040
-Yes, sir.
-It's true.

57
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,760
But you need to be a monster
to defeat Hitler.

58
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:16,440
-Did Jock give you my box?
-He did, sir.

59
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,520
What's in it?

60
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,640
-You'd like me to open it?
-Unless you have X-ray vision,

61
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:27,480
you will need to open it, so as
to be able to tell me what's in it.

62
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,240
Well?

63
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,320
-Some papers about rationing.
-What else?

64
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,080
Some papers from the Exchequer.

65
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:41,400
Anything from the Foreign Office?
About America or the Soviet Union?

66
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,720
-No, sir.
-Oh, very well.

67
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,440
Then start with the Exchequer.
Read it aloud.

68
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:51,960
Don't be alarmed
if you hear no response.

69
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,680
I shall be making mental notes.

70
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:57,440
-"The economic situation--
-What?

71
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:11,080
"The economic situation we have
inherited is worse than 1949...

72
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,760
and, in many ways, worse-- [yelps]

73
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:19,760
worse than 1947.

74
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,960
Confidence in Sterling is impaired.

75
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:28,240
And now our latest estimates
suggest that in 1952..."

76
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:31,680
...the United Kingdom will have
a deficit on its general balance

77
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:37,120
of overseas payments of between
five and 600 million pounds.

78
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:42,000
Given these circumstances, I'd be
interested to hear the PM's views

79
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:46,800
regarding the chances for recovery.

80
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,720
Either we get rid of him now
or we lose the next election

81
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,640
and, quite possibly,
lose power for a whole generation.

82
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,480
You must act, Anthony!
This is your time.

83
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:08,880
The country needs
a younger, more dynamic man.

84
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,840
And what do you expect me to do? Hmm?

85
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,800
He's the party leader.

86
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:22,200
And he became party leader
on our recommendation.

87
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,760
I can't just push him out.

88
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,960
Then you must go and see
the one person who can.

89
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,080
[cheering]

90
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:04,160
[clapping and chanting]

91
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:15,360
-Welcome to Sagana Lodge, ma'am.
-Thank you very much.

92
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,240
Hello.

93
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,760
Are those for me?
Thank you very much.

94
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:31,040
<i>-Karibu.</i>
-Thank you.

95
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:37,320
Apparently, there's a large breeding
herd of elephants at Treetops.

96
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:40,520
-So we've got to get there early.
-Not too early, I hope.

97
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,760
And why? What else have you got
in mind for our little holiday?

98
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,360
Why does everybody think,
just because we're royal,

99
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:53,160
we like fine dining?
Don't they realize we're savages?

100
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,560
Good for nothing
but school dinners and nursery food.

101
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:58,400
It's all right, you can use your
fingers.

102
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,600
-Philip.
-Look, stop, watch.

103
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,840
Ma'am.

104
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,160
Your Royal Highness.

105
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,160
Kiss me.

106
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,000
Come on.

107
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:28,880
His Majesty will return
from the shoot at 4 p.m.

108
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:51,800
-Good afternoon, sir.
-Good afternoon.

109
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:54,480
His Majesty wondered
if you'd mind accompanying him

110
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,880
on the shoot at Beecher's Club today.

111
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,600
No, not at all.

112
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,600
Still rather wet underfoot, I'm
afraid, after the storms yesterday,

113
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,480
but we can provide you
with Wellington boots.

114
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,280
-There's no need to worry.
-What size are you, sir?

115
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,640
Nine and a half.

116
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:14,400
Though my riding boots are a ten,
and my trench boots were an 11.

117
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,560
Make of that what you will.

118
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,840
[shouting]

119
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:31,200
Much of this
is just a function of age.

120
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,920
He focuses almost entirely

121
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,640
on issues relating to America
and the Soviet Union,

122
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,800
so important domestic matters...

123
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,000
-are falling behind.
-[coughing]

124
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,720
What do you suggest I do?

125
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,560
Well, as sovereign, of course,
there is nothing you can do

126
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,800
from a constitutional standpoint.

127
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:05,760
But, as a friend... as Albert Windsor,

128
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:09,800
you are the one person I can think of
to whom he might listen.

129
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:16,320
Well, that is where we run
into difficulties, I'm afraid.

130
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:20,680
I no longer am Albert Windsor.

131
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:27,440
That person was murdered by his
elder brother... when he abdicated.

132
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:30,280
And, of course,
Albert Windsor would dearly love

133
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:35,760
to say to his old friend,
Winston Churchill, "Take a step back.

134
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:39,760
Put your feet up. Let the younger
generation have a go now."

135
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,400
But he is no longer with us

136
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:48,080
and that void has been filled
by George the VI

137
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,520
who, it turns out,
is quite the stickler,

138
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:56,960
and... [clears throat]
no more allow the sovereign

139
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:01,600
to interfere with the Prime Minister
than stand for office himself.

140
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,480
Even when it's in
the national interest, sir?

141
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:08,560
The national interests?
Or Anthony Eden's interest?

142
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,400
[King George coughs]

143
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,400
The reason I agreed to grant you
an audience,

144
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:28,480
not to hear your grievances
about Mr. Churchill

145
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,560
but to communicate mine about you.

146
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,320
Sir?

147
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,880
The PM will step down in time.

148
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:41,120
And until then, as sovereign,

149
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:47,080
I do have the right to be consulted,
to encourage, to warn.

150
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:54,720
It is better to be patient and get
what you desire in the right time...

151
00:13:56,040 --> 00:14:00,120
than have high office thrust upon you
when you are not ready.

152
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,240
I speak from personal experience.

153
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,600
Foreign Secretary.

154
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,600
-Your Majesty.
-Sir.

155
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,800
Shall we begin to walk back, sir?

156
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:55,840
Use the accelerator,
we'll be all right. Thank you.

157
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,600
-Are we on foot from here?
-Philip. Philip.

158
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,320
-Looks that way, sir.
-Thank you. Thank you.

159
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,120
-Your Highness.
-Thank you.

160
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,360
I'm your guide.
I'll take you to Treetops.

161
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,520
[Philip] Jolly good. Thank you.

162
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,720
Pass me my rifle. Thank you.
And the shells.

163
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,680
[guide] But I must ask you to proceed
in total silence from here on.

164
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,600
Do not speak
unless absolutely necessary

165
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,760
and then, only using a low voice.

166
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,240
Along the way, we
may have to use some hand signals.

167
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,920
This means stop and this means
freeze.

168
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,600
We'll move in small groups, single
file, maximum three at a time.

169
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:35,520
It's alright. We'll be fine.
After you, darling.

170

00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,360
It's all right.

338
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:30,600
You're not going. I won't let you go.

339
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,960
Ma'am, may I have a word?

340
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:56,440
It appears Miss MacDonald neglected
to pack a black dress.

341
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:57,920
We've called ahead to London

342
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,080
and something will be brought
onto the plane before you disembark.

343
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:02,840
Right.

344
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:10,000
And a word of warning, ma'am.
A good many journalists outside.

345
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:17,680
Royal correspondents mostly,
assigned to cover the tour.

346
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,520
-Should I say something?
-No.

347
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:23,960
That won't be necessary.

348
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:29,080
Though it would help if we could
decide here and now on your name.

349
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:35,120
-My name?
-Yes, ma'am. Your regnal name.

350
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:40,000
That is the name you'll take
as Queen. Your father took George.

351
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:41,960
Obviously his name is...

352
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:44,440
was, Albert.

353
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:50,480
And, before he abdicated,
your uncle took Edward, of course.

354
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,480
His name was David.

355
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,960
-What's wrong with my name?
-Nothing.

356
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:05,640
Well, then, let's not overcomplicate
matters unnecessarily.

357
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,040
My name is Elizabeth.

358
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:12,800
Then, long live Queen Elizabeth.

359
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:32,120
So sorry about the dress, ma'am.

360
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,040
All right.

361
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,960

-I couldn't sleep.

368
00:41:57,240 --> 00:42:00,360
No one in the country can sleep.

369
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:03,680
I know one shouldn't believe
everything one hears...

370
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:04,760
But?

371
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:08,360
I was speaking
with Jock Colville's wife.

372
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:10,320
-Mary. Margaret.
-Margaret.

373
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:15,560
She said that Anthony went to see
the King ten days ago.

374
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:17,200
What for?

375
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:20,200
To express his concern
about your age.

376
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:23,960
Your leadership. Your incapacity.

377
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:27,960
-To ask him to bid you stand down.
-That's impossible.

378
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:30,640
The King would never engage
in such treachery.

379
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:34,800
And Anthony would never dare.
I've been like a father to him.

380
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:37,960
I groomed him every step of the way.

381
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:44,760
Well, ignore me, then.

382
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:47,600
It's probably nothing.

383
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:50,600
Come on, it's probably nothing.

384
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:57,000
-What are you up to?
-It's my eulogy for the King.

385
00:42:57,080 --> 00:43:01,280
It's broadcast tomorrow
and the right words keep eluding me.

386
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:05,640
-They'll want you to fail, you know.
-[sighs] I know.

387
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:09,160
Anything less than perfect
will be a disaster.

388
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:14,000
Anthony, eh?

389
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:25,520
I can't sleep.

390
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:27,680
No.

391
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:48,120
I'm sorry.

392
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:51,720
You're sorry?

393
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:56,160
I'm sorry.

394
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:58,120
I thought we'd have longer.

395
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:04,240
Ma'am. Three hours to go now.

00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:15,440
-What do you think will happen?
-When?

397
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:19,600
When we land.

398
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:23,440
What will happen then?

399
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:33,040
-Morning.
-Morning.

400
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:36,120
The PM will not be joining us
this morning.

401
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:40,440
He is very much tired
from all the emotion of yesterday.

402
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:43,080
-So, where is he?
-He's still asleep.

403
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:49,320
So, in his absence, as deputy,
I will preside.

404
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:55,480
-The Queen's flight--
-Wait a minute, Anthony.

405
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:59,800
If you're presiding over the meeting
on behalf of the PM,

406
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:03,800
shouldn't you be sitting
in the appropriate chair?

407
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:06,000
I don't think that's entirely necessary.

408
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:18,880
Very well.

409
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:36,520
So, the Queen's flight
is now over Italy,

410
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:41,640
having left the El Adem airfield
in Libya at five this morning.

411
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:47,160
Sorry to disturb.

412
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:55,000
May I just say how very sorry I am

413
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:57,080
that we'll not be working
together anymore.

414
00:45:57,640 --> 00:45:59,000
Why?

415
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:02,200
I have to give way
to Sir Tommy Lascelles.

416
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:06,920
As private secretary to the
sovereign, he's my senior.

417
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:10,880
This is where I have to stand aside
for the great man.

418
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:14,080
Martin... so sorry.

419
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:22,560
Ma'am.

420
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:27,280
[Philip] What a nightmare.

421
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:31,440
Charteris at least had one foot
in the real world.

422
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:35,360
And was your man, our man,
on our side.

423
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:38,240
Whereas Tommy Lascelles...

00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:41,680

-I did.

00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:54,800
-Will you sit?
-Thank you, sir.

428
00:46:56,760 --> 00:47:00,560
I'd assumed that following the death
of His Late Majesty,

429
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:04,440
you would,
at the earliest appropriate moment,

430
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:07,320
be resuming your duties
with the Royal Air Force.

431
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:08,520
Yes, sir.

432
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:12,760
I mentioned this to the Queen...

433
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:17,960
the Queen Mother, this morning,
who then asked me,

434
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:20,600
quite unusually,
to ask you whether you might like

435
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:23,800
-to reconsider such a departure.
-Oh, sir?

436
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:27,200
She felt that you had enjoyed
an uncommonly close association

437
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:31,000
with her late husband
and earned not just his trust,

438
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:33,040
but the trust and affection
of the family.

439
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:34,560
Thank you, sir.

440
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:37,720
In the light of this, she wondered
whether you might consider

441
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:39,240
staying on in a new role,

442
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:43,120
as comptroller of the Queen Mother's
household.

443
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:45,520
-I see.
-A kind and generous offer.

444
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:48,440
As befits the widow of a kind...

445
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:51,400
and generous man.

446
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:54,840
But, while I'm sure you're flattered,

447
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:56,720
I don't expect you to accept
the post.

448
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:59,120
Hence my discouragement of the offer.

449
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:02,040
I didn't want Her Majesty to suffer
the embarrassment of a refusal.

450
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:03,960
Why would I not accept, sir?

451
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:07,320
Well, you're asking
the wrong question, Townsend.

452
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:09,160
Why would you?

453
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:11,520
You're a decorated war hero,
still in your prime,

454
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:13,720
and comptroller of the Queen Mother's
household

455
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:15,640
has no military associations.

456
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:17,680
It would take you away
from your wife and children.

457
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:20,240
After all, the person

458
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:24,680
with whom you enjoyed the uncommonly
close understanding is deceased.

459
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:32,680
Unless I'm missing something.

460
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:35,320
Unless, there is someone else

461
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:38,200
with whom you enjoy
an uncommonly close understanding,

462
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:40,760
which would make accepting this post
more attractive.

463
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:44,600
I don't know
what you're referring to.

464
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:46,720
Don't you, Group Captain Townsend?

465
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:49,640
Husband and father.

466
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:52,760
No, sir.

467
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:03,480
You're probably telling yourself

468
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:08,440
that because no one has confronted
you about it, that no one can know.

469
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:12,800
Allow me to disabuse you
of that delusion.

470
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:16,440
Within the close community
of those that serve the family,

471
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:20,560
I regret to tell you,
that talk, ugly talk,

472
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:23,880
unbecoming tittle-tattle
is of little else.

473
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:27,560
Now I'm well aware of the toll
that round-the-clock service

474
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:30,600
takes on the private lives
of those that serve.

475
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:37,240
I am also aware of the feelings
generated by continued close proximity

476
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:40,040
to the people you are working for,
but I would hate you

477
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:43,520
to mistake those feelings
for anything else.

478
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:57,320
Will you thank the Queen Mother
for her kind offer?

479
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:05,400
I should be delighted to accept.

480
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:08,720
There's no rush.
Take your time to think it over.

481
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:12,360
Seventy-two hours... a week.

482
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:14,800
I want you to make
the right decision.

483
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:18,920
I already have, sir.
The answer is yes.

484
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:53,640
-Gentlemen.
-Winston.

485
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:55,640
Impeccable timing.

486
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:01,920
That's the one.

487
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:13,680
Your Majesty,
I've been asked to give you this.

488
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:17,440
And this, Ma'am,
from Her Majesty Queen Mary.

489
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:18,600
Thank you.

490
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:25,640
Thank you, Charteris.
I'll take over from here.

00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:33,320
-Thank you, Martin.
-Thank you, sir.

493
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:43,040

<i>And I know you will be as devastated</i>
<i>as I am by this loss.</i>

497
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:17,080
<i>But you must put those sentiments</i>
<i>to one side now,</i>

498
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:19,560
<i>for duty calls.</i>

00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:24,080
<i>The grief for your father's death</i>
<i>will be felt far and wide.</i>

503
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:46,160
<i>You must not allow yourself</i>
<i>to make similar mistakes.</i>

504
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:52,200
<i>And while you mourn your father,</i>
<i>you must also mourn someone else.</i>

508
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:17,000
<i>The fact is, the Crown must win.</i>

509
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:21,840
<i>Must always win.</i>

510
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:26,520
-Ready, ma'am?
-It's all right.

511
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:28,120
I'll escort her down from here.

512
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:31,320
No, sir. If you don't mind,
the Crown takes precedence.

513
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:01,600
Stand by, everybody.

514
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:24,680
[man on radio] <i>This is London.</i>

515
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:28,760
[man] Three, two, one.

516
00:54:56,360 --> 00:55:03,080
When the death of the King was
announced to us yesterday morning,

517
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:08,000
there struck a deep
and somber note in our lives,

518
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:11,200
<i>which resounded far and wide,</i>

519
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:18,440
<i>stilled the clatter</i>
<i>and traffic of 20th century life,</i>

520
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:26,720
<i>and made countless millions</i>
<i>of human beings around the world</i>

521
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:30,160
<i>pause and look around them.</i>

522
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:39,200
<i>The King was greatly loved</i>
<i>by all his peoples.</i>

523
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:45,240
The greatest shocks ever felt
by this island

524
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:47,600
fell upon us in his reign.

525
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:51,680
Never, in our long history

526
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:57,400
were we exposed to greater perils
of invasion and destruction.

527
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:07,720
<i>The late King, who assumed</i>
<i>the heavy burden of the Crown</i>

528
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:10,120
<i>when he succeeded his brother,</i>

529
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:15,760
<i>lived through every minute</i>
<i>of this struggle</i>

530
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:19,120
<i>with a heart that never quavered</i>

531
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:24,200
<i>and a spirit undaunted.</i>

532
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:37,080
In the end, death came as a friend.

533
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:45,080
<i>And after a happy day</i>
<i>of sunshine and sport,</i>

534
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:50,120
<i>and after a goodnight</i>
<i>to those who loved him best,</i>

535
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:51,680
<i>he fell asleep,</i>

536
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:55,840
<i>as every man or woman</i>

537
00:56:55,920 --> 00:57:00,960
<i>who strives to fear God</i>
<i>and nothing else in the world,</i>

538
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:02,520
<i>may hope to do.</i>

539
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:06,000
[sobs]

540
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:23,520
<i>Now, I must leave</i>

541
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:29,320
<i>the treasures of the past</i>
<i>and turn to the future.</i>

542
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:34,360
<i>Famous have been the reigns</i>
<i>of our queens.</i>

543
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:37,480
<i>Some of the greatest periods</i>
<i>in our history</i>

544
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:40,320
<i>have unfolded under their scepters.</i>

545
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:46,440
<i>Queen Elizabeth II,</i>

546
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:49,800
<i>like her namesake, Queen Elizabeth I,</i>

547
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:57,200
<i>did not pass her childhood in any</i>
<i>certain expectation of the Crown.</i>

548
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:01,680
<i>This new Elizabethan age</i>

549
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:07,040
<i>comes at a time when mankind stands</i>
<i>uncertainly poised...</i>

550
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:08,360
Wait.

551
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:11,880
<i>...on the edge of catastrophe.</i>

552
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:20,960
I, whose youth was passed
in the august, unchallenged

553
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:25,880
and tranquil glories
of the Victorian era,

554
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:31,680
<i>may well feel the thrill</i>
<i>in invoking once more</i>

555
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:36,400
the prayer and the anthem,

556
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:40,600
God Save the Queen.

557
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,480
[all] God Save the Queen.
