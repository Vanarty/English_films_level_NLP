Everyone ready? Margaret?

180
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,680
-Sir.
-Thank you.

Thank you.

Everyone inside. We're starting now.

193

Thank you so much for coming.
Oh, good, you're here!

194
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:43,240
Right, come on, you two, inside.
Can't start without you.

195
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,240
-Boys, come on.
-Yes, ma'am.

196
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,240
Thank you. [giggles]

[tapping on glass]

198
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,480
Ladies and gentlemen, pray silence for
Her Royal Highness, Princess Elizabeth.

199
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,760
Thank you, Martin.

200
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,800
As I'm sure you all know,

201
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:09,120
my dear husband will soon
no longer be Lieutenant Mountbatten

202
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,680
-but Lieutenant-Commander Mountbatten.

-[applause]
-Thank you very much.

204
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:19,920
Which, I gather, involves a whole new
gold ring for me to sew onto your uniform!

205
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,800
Half a gold ring, darling.
Half a gold ring, gentlemen.

206
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:23,920
[telephone ringing]

207
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:29,600
So I've asked the two most important
people here to do the presentation.

208
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,960
Hello? Charteris. Yes?

209
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,280
-Ah.
-[laughs]

210
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,600
Very good.

211
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:50,160
There we are.
Good boy, Charles, well done!

212
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,160
-Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
-[applause]

213
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,880
Important call from London, ma'am.

214
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,200
[doctors talking indistinctly]

215
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,080
[Elizabeth] Charles! Anne!

216
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,600
[Philip] Children. Wait. Wait.

217
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,640
They're waiting
in the green drawing room, ma'am.

218
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,000
-Right.
-Where's grandpapa?

219
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,400
He's upstairs with the doctors.

220
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,240
Now, you wait with nanny
and we'll be back in a minute.

221
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:13,080
Charles, wait. Here. Okay?

222
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,080
-Mummy.
-So glad you're here.

223
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:26,040
-We came as soon as we could.
-I know.

224
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,760
-Ma'am, I'm so sorry...
-Granny.

225
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,320
They're operating.

226
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:37,360
It's been two hours.

227
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,520
-[door opens]
-He's here.

228
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,040
I'm happy to say the procedure went well,

229
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:09,920
and that His Majesty's immediate
post-operative condition is satisfactory.

230
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,320
[sobbing]

231
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,320
Thank you, doctor.

232
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:24,000
That's good news, isn't it?
Yes. Are you all right?

A little bacon won't hurt, surely, Gerald?
It's been five weeks.

239
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,400
Let's cool this down.

240
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:26,720
And make sure that egg is well-plated
and no shell to risk irritation.

241
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:30,240
And turn that noise off.
He'll still be prime minister tomorrow.

00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,720
-Ready?
-Ready.

243
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,360

Good morning, Your Majesty.

-Your first day back at work.
-Who won?

248
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,240
Who, who won?

249
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:59,040
Mr. Churchill, Your Majesty. By 17 seats.

250
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,840
Good for him! You didn't hear me say that.

What this nation needs is several years

259

of strong, steady,

00:25:56,680 --> 00:26:00,400
Congratulations, sir.
Dr. Moran is here for you.

263
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:11,120
Yes, you just won a General Election,
but...

264
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:16,600
155 over 90.

265
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,240
We can do better, Winston.

266
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,400
Have a look at this for me, will you?

267
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:31,400
In the war, we used mathematicians
to decode the indecipherable.

268
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,840
I need an expert
to cut through the jargon.

269
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,800
Are they keeping something from me?

270
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:43,240
Well, I wouldn't be unduly concerned
about the man's pneumatics.

271
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,120
And, given his age, and he's a smoker.

272
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,360
Catarrhal inflammation,
it's not that unusual.

273
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:52,040
But I would be concerned
about the bronchoscopy.

274
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:54,320
They wouldn't have done that
unless they were looking

275
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,360
for something far more serious.

276
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:59,400
And they conspicuously fail
to mention the results.

277
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:03,280
Instead they go on
about the lung resection.

278
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:07,640
Which they performed
because of "structural alterations".

279
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:11,840
What are structural alterations?

280
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:14,080
It's what doctors say
when they avoid using the word

281
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:16,800
that it almost inevitably describes.

282
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,600
Who is this man?

283
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,080
Just a little.

284
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,640
One doesn't want to overdo it.

285
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:38,200
One doesn't want to look ill, either.

286
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,200
A sick...

287
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,000
king is no good to anyone.

288
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:49,600
There must be no weakness.

289
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:52,440
No vulnerability.

290
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,400
Oh, thank you.

-This one never sits. Get rid of it.

Mr. Churchill, Your Majesty.

296
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:45,920
Your Majesty.

297
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:49,520
The people have spoken.

298
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:53,480
Your party has won the election,

299
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:57,120
and as... as their Sovereign,

300
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:00,200
I invite you to form a government
in my name.

301
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:03,200
An honor I gratefully accept.

302
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:07,320
My dear Winston. Congratulations.

303
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:13,240
Would it be terribly unconstitutional
of me to say how happy I am?

304
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:17,360
I've missed our weekly chats.

305
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,680

306
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:24,600
Your predecessor
is a fine parliamentarian.

307
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,720
A good man.

308
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:32,440
But, well, as company, as a companion...

309
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:37,360
An empty taxi pulled up at the House
of Commons, and Mr. Attlee got out.

310
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,960
[laughs] Quite.

311
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:46,960
[sighs]
Now you may congratulate me in return.

312
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,760
What for?

313
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,600
My rapid recovery.

314
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:54,400
-Oh.
-Yes.

315
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:58,680
I seem to have bounced back
a lot quicker than people expected.

316
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,480
Yes.

317
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:05,040
Not sure I ever imagined what breathing
through one lung would feel like.

318
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:08,760
Turns out there's barely any difference.
[chuckles]

319
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,800
Good. Good.

320
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:20,920
Though... probably wise
to let the Princess Elizabeth

321
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,880
undertake the Commonwealth tour? Hm?

322
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,480
What say you?

323
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,520
-Is she up to it?
-Yes, I'd say so.

324
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:37,440
Besides... we have to start
breaking her in gently, don't we?

325
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,360
Do we?

326
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,560
Keep one eye on the future.

327
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,560
The distant future.

-It's the teleprinter.
-Let's have it upstairs.

-Everything as it was before, sir?
-Yes!

333
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:31,640
Everything exactly as it was before.

334
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:36,520
Ladies. Ladies. Now-- Who's this?

335
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:41,040
-Oh, Miss Venetia Scott, sir.
-A new addition.

336
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:44,520
-A good one, I'd say.
-Thank you, sir.

337
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,800
I had hoped
I'd seen the back of this place.

338
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:52,400
Could you give us a moment,
please, Jock?

339
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,480
Thank you.

340
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,920
How was the king?

341
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:04,880
He talked a great deal about his recovery.
Lots of mentions of "bouncing back".

342
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:07,840
Which always makes one fear the worst.

343
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,600
Not to mention the make-up.

344
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,200
He was wearing rouge.

345
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,560
Poor man.

346
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,080
It's cancer.

347
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,400
What?

348
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:32,640
-Who knows?
-No one.

349
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,800
Least of all him.

350
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:40,880
-Sir? Lunch.
-Let's have it in here.

351
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:44,400
See what they've been serving
for the past five years.

352
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:49,560
-So he's dying?
-We're all dying.

353
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:53,760
That's what defines
the condition of living.

354
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,920
Will he die tomorrow? No.

355
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,560
What about the day after tomorrow?
And the day after that?

356
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:02,080
The country needs to be led
by someone strong.

357
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:06,240
-Well, I'm strong!
-You are also tired, Winston.

358
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,160
We both are.

359
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:11,080
A situation like that
would require enormous energy.

360
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,400
And I won't lie to you.

361
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:18,360
I have considered resigning
for Anthony's sake.

362
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:19,880
For your sake.

363
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:25,440
But then I realized a situation like that
would also require statesmanship.

364
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:28,400
The party needs me.
The country needs me.

365
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,040
She needs me.

366
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:32,880
-Who?
-Her!

367
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:35,720
Oh, her.

368
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:41,360
[Philip] This is Clarence House
dining room to Clarence House kitchen.

369
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,880
Dining room to kitchen.

370
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:47,520
-[Charles] Dining room to kitchen!
-Yes. Dining room to kitchen!

371
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:48,600
Oh, bugger it!

372
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:51,960
Right, check the circuits
and up the amperage of the fuse wire.

373
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,640
Right, I'm off.

374
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:56,480
-Breakfast with your mother?
-And Margaret.

375
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:59,800
Imagine.
I'm checking curtain fabrics in an hour.

376
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:02,240
-[laughs]
-[Philip] Yes.

377
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:06,960
Let's pick the curtains.

378
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:10,200
-Where to, ma'am?
-Buckingham Palace, please.

379
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:14,720
Buckingham Palace.

380
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,680
-I see.
-[knock at door]

381
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:26,200
[man] The queen has asked to see you.

382
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:29,480
Yes, we look forward
to seeing the doctor then.

383
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:31,920
-Thank you. Goodbye.
-Drawing room!

384
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,920
-Now?
-Yes.

385
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:43,440
We do both so love
living at Clarence House

386
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:46,640
and he has all sorts of ideas
about how to modernize it.

387
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:48,800
He really is rather ingenious like that,
actually.

388
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:52,040
-Now, Peter.
-Your Majesty. Your Royal Highnesses.

389
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:54,600
I have to make a decision
about Christmas.

390
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:58,520
Tell me, do you think the King will be
well enough to go to Sandringham?

391
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:01,080
I do. As a matter of fact,
I think it would do him good.

392
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:04,880
-So it's decided.
-Will you be joining us, too?

393
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,320
Me?

394
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:12,360
Course not. Peter will be spending
Christmas at home with his family.

395
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:14,440
I was only thinking of papa.

396
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:17,080
Given the choice, you know
he'd never let him out of his sight.

397
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:18,880
Well, that's true.

398
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:22,760
-He's quite devoted to you.
-Then let me discuss it with Rosemary.

399
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:25,800
Oh, no. No, it's out of the question.

400
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:30,360
Why, mummy? Let Peter discuss it.

401
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,760
-Well, he did offer.
-Oh, very well.

402
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:35,840
[bell rings]

403
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:38,360
But, as a wife,
I know what my answer would be.

404
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:41,880
I'd want my husband at home
at Christmas with his children.

405
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,040
Excuse me.

406
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:57,560
I saw that.

407
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:01,960
What? No, I haven't finished.

408
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,800
That look between the two of you.

409
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:10,480
-Oh, Margaret!
-You must tell no one.

410
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:13,600
The papers all think I'm for
Johnny Dalkeith or Billy Wallace.

411
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:17,480
-Mummy and Papa, too, by the way.
-They're just boys. Whereas Peter is...

412
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:20,280
No, I quite see the attraction of Peter.

413
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,520
But he's married.

414
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:37,320
[knock at door, door opens]

415
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:40,840
Doctor Weir, Your Majesty.

416
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:51,120
You told me that, after the operation,

417
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:56,080
I might expect some... soreness,

418
00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:00,600
some difficulty breathing.

419
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:04,840
But you didn't tell me about this.

420
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,960
-The coughing has returned?
-Yes.

421
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:10,000
-How often?
-All the time.

422
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:18,200
At the time of the operation, as you know,
structural alterations were discovered.

423
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:20,480
Of course. The blockage in the lung.

424
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,480
It's time we gave that blockage a name,
sir.

425
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:28,040
It was a tumor.

426
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,240
A malignant tumor.

427
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,280
I see.

428
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:45,080
-But... we removed it?
-We did.

429
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:48,320
So what is this?

430
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:51,480
We removed the left lung, sir.
But the right...

431
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:58,040
has fewer,
but still significant, blockages.

432
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,400
So, what's next?

433
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,280
Next?

434
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:27,320
I argued that His Majesty
should be told at the time.

435
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:30,600
A patient has a right
to know the full picture.

436
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:33,840
But I was overruled. The theory was that,
if His Majesty felt he'd been cured,

437
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:38,520
he could throw himself into his work
without undue stress and, and, and worry.

438
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:58,560
I have two questions.

439
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,520
Who knows the full picture?

440
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:05,640
Apart from the surgeons?

441
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,720
Perhaps the Prime Minister, sir.

442
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,280
Of course.

443
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,280
But not the queen?

444
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:25,280
-Nor anyone else in my family?
-No, sir.

445
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,400
And the second question?

446
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,640
It's impossible to say, sir.

447
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:45,760
My understanding is the surgeons
did everything they could.

448
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,920
And?

449
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,720
It could be years.

450
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:57,520
More likely months.

451
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,360

they stick on top.

00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:01,000
Well, ever since he started
supervising the work,

528
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:04,040
he can't look at anything
without seeing its faults.

529
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:08,840
"That switch is an inch too high.
And that door handle's wrong."

530
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:11,880
"Well, don't be silly," I say.
"A handle's a handle."

531
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:13,640
I should make more of an effort with him.

532
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:17,440
Take him shooting.

533
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:20,040
-Would he like that?
-Yes, I think he'd love it.

534
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:22,800
And then when your health's improved,
we'll return to Malta

535
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:26,200
and he'll have his navy again,
and all will be well.

536
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:27,680
Of course.

537
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:34,840
But, in the meantime...
I'm still not yet well enough to travel.

538
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:38,160
Not long distances, anyway.

539
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:41,800
Which brings me
to the forthcoming Commonwealth tour.

540
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:46,200
I was wondering if you would consider
stepping into my shoes, so to speak.

541
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:52,840
My health is improving
but I'm still not yet well enough.

542
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:57,920
-Well, if you think we're up to it.
-You'll be fine.

543
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:02,280
-Where is it?
-Well...

544
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:05,080
Ceylon. Australia.

545
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:07,800
Then on to New Zealand. Bermuda.

546
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:10,160
And there's talk of starting in Kenya.

547
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:11,920
Very good!

548
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,640
Right, we'll be gone months.

549
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:18,680
Yes. But it would mean so much
to papa that we do it.

550
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:23,400
-What am I supposed to do all that time?
-Don't worry, we'll put you to work.

551
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:25,280
My work is as a naval officer,

552
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:28,280
not grinning like a demented ape
while you cut ribbons!

553
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:31,800
-What about the children?
-The children will be fine.

554
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:35,560
Oh! Without their parents
for months on end?

555
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:39,000
-Daddy, can you come and play?
-I won't be a moment, darling.

556
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:41,560
If you go and play with grandpapa,
I'll be right over. Good boy.

557
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:44,560
[Queen Elizabeth] Come on, darling,
Daddy's busy. Come and start again.

558
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:46,880
-[Charles] Daddy's coming.
-They won't know.

559
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:49,320
-They're too young to notice.
-Come on. Be quiet.

560
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:51,480
It would so help in papa's recovery.

561
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:56,040
[King George] Charles, come back here.

562
00:48:56,120 --> 00:48:59,240
-[Charles] Daddy, can you play now?
-[King George] Charles.

563
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:06,440
Yes.

564
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:10,880
Thank you.

565
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:13,760
-[Philip] What are we playing?
-[Charles] Granny's footsteps.

566
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:15,960
[Philip] Come on then. Let's go.
And then it's bedtime.

567
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:18,200
[Queen Elizabeth] Ready, steady...

568
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:20,560
[bagpipes playing]

569
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:29,920
[coughing]

570
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:40,760
Sir?

571
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:57,520
-What's the weather like today?
-Rather misty at the moment, sir.

572
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:02,360
-Morning!
-Bugger off!

573
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:09,320
Yes, I'm not sure that's the correct
address for the King of England.

574
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:12,080
-It's a beautiful morning for duck.
-What?

575
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:14,760
I thought Wolferton Splash.

576
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:21,680
Christ.

577
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:27,280
[breathless laugh]

578
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:31,400
-[ducks quacking]
-Reed warbler, see?

579
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:37,240
Oh, Teal. Below the withy there.

580
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:41,480
When I woke up this morning, I thought
we'd go to Babingley Flat or Eleven Acres.

581
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:44,440
But, in the end,
there's nowhere better than the Splash

582
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:47,680
with a bagful of cartridges
to lift the spirits.

583
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:49,720
His Majesty's back to himself again.

584
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:53,080
Oh, he is, thank you.
Like a young man again.

585
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:54,680
[coughs]

586
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:00,760
[laughs]

587
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:04,200
We'll be all right.
My son-in-law's a naval man.

588
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:07,160
We will. If I can handle a frigate.

589
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:28,200
You understand, the titles,
the... dukedom.

590
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,800
-They're not the job.
-Sir?

591
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:38,200
She is the job.

592
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:43,160
She is the essence of your duty.

593
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:45,760
Loving her.

594
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:49,240
Protecting her.

595
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:55,040
Of course, you'll miss your career.

596
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:01,520
But doing this for her,
doing this for me...

597
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:07,840
there may be no greater act of patriotism.

598
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:10,680
Or love.

599
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:17,240
I understand, sir.

600
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:20,920
Do you, boy?

601
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:24,360
Do you really?

602
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:30,880
I think so.

603
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:43,240
Come.

604
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:45,720
Let's go shoot some duck, shall we?

605
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:47,320
Three cheers for His Majesty!

606
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:49,400
-Hip, hip!
-[all] Hooray!

607
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:51,400
-Hip, hip!
-[all] Hooray!

608
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:53,160
-Hip, hip!
-[all] Hooray!

609
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:55,680
[King George] You're too kind. Thank you.

610
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:11,040
[coughs]

611
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:22,920
-[men talking]
-[dogs bark]

612
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:31,480
-[gunshots]
-[ducks quacking]

613
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:44,280
-[gunshots]
-[men shouting]

614
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:16,280
[coughing]

615
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:36,640
[gunshots]
