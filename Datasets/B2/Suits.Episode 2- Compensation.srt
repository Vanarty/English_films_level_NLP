00:06:22,372 --> 00:06:24,038
at the meeting,
so I can smack it down.

177
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:25,373
Why would you do that?

178
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:26,958
Because I saw the look
on Harvey's face.

179
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:28,542
He's jealous of us,

180
00:06:28,544 --> 00:06:30,344
and I want the chance
to back him publicly.

181
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:32,713
Louis, Harvey
might be upset about us,

182
00:06:32,715 --> 00:06:34,265
but encouraging people
to go after him

183
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:37,184
just so you can have his back
is a huge mistake.

184
00:06:40,223 --> 00:06:42,790
You were at Millstein Swain
for seven years.

185
00:06:42,825 --> 00:06:45,145
When Ellen Swain retired, I
decided it was time to move on.

186
00:06:45,194 --> 00:06:46,944
Why not go to another partner
in the firm?

187
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:48,646
Because I didn't think
any of the other partners

188
00:06:48,698 --> 00:06:50,064
were good enough.

189
00:06:50,066 --> 00:06:51,482
I appreciate the honesty.

190
00:06:51,534 --> 00:06:53,401
And I appreciate being
the first person you called in,

191
00:06:53,403 --> 00:06:55,369
and if you're as good
at reading people as they say,

192
00:06:55,405 --> 00:06:57,488
I'll also be the last.

193
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:59,707
- Is that a fact?
- Call anyone you want.

194
00:06:59,742 --> 00:07:02,243
I'm the Deion Sanders
of legal secretaries.

195
00:07:02,295 --> 00:07:04,712
- Deion Sanders?
- I'm quick on my feet.

196
00:07:04,747 --> 00:07:06,067
I know how to
intercept a problem.

197
00:07:06,082 --> 00:07:07,632
Yeah, but Deion Sanders?

198
00:07:07,667 --> 00:07:10,384
If you prefer another era,
Dick Butkus.

199
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:12,920
Either way, no one gets by me.

200
00:07:12,922 --> 00:07:15,756
You don't look like Dick Butkus.

201
00:07:15,808 --> 00:07:18,009
No, I don't.

202
00:07:18,061 --> 00:07:20,811

I'm not letting you sell

235
00:08:46,607 --> 00:08:48,127
your company
for pennies on the dollar.

236
00:08:48,141 --> 00:08:49,608
Where the hell
is this coming from?

237
00:08:49,643 --> 00:08:51,176
It's coming from the fact that
life is short,

238
00:08:51,211 --> 00:08:53,144
I'm burnt out,
and I'm ready to move on.

239
00:08:53,197 --> 00:08:54,529
Life is short?

240
00:08:54,565 --> 00:08:55,897
That's your reason
for not thinking this through?

241
00:08:55,949 --> 00:08:57,065
I don't want
to think it through.

242
00:08:57,117 --> 00:09:00,318
I might change my mind
and not do it at all.

243
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:02,988
Okay, Teddy, you want to sell?

244
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:05,323
Sell, but we built this company
from the ground up.

245
00:09:05,325 --> 00:09:08,159
Give me a week
to get you a better offer.

246
00:09:08,212 --> 00:09:10,879
I'll give you the same thing
they're giving me.

247
00:09:10,914 --> 00:09:13,415
48 hours.

248
00:09:13,467 --> 00:09:15,166
Then I'll take it.

249
00:09:18,338 --> 00:09:20,255
By the way, where's Donna?

250
00:09:20,307 --> 00:09:22,390
- She moved on.
- You see?

251
00:09:22,426 --> 00:09:24,175
That's what I'm talking about.

252
00:09:24,228 --> 00:09:25,393
Life is short.

253
00:09:25,429 --> 00:09:26,895
Donna moved on
to something better.

254
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:29,014
She didn't move on
to something better.

255
00:09:29,066 --> 00:09:30,315
What do you mean?

256
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:31,516
She's working for Louis.

257
00:09:31,568 --> 00:09:33,351
Litt?
What the hell happened?

258
00:09:33,403 --> 00:09:34,403
Nothing happened.

259
00:09:34,404 --> 00:09:35,854
Just time for a change.

260
00:09:35,856 --> 00:09:37,906
Ah.

261
00:09:37,941 --> 00:09:40,061
If she's working for that
asshole, something happened.

262
00:09:40,077 --> 00:09:42,060
Teddy, you say you know
when it's time to move on,

263
00:09:42,095 --> 00:09:45,530
it's time to move on
from this topic right now.

264
00:09:45,532 --> 00:09:48,199
Okay, Harvey.

265
00:09:48,201 --> 00:09:52,370
All I'm saying is Mrs. Keebler
out there ain't no Donna.

266
00:10:00,213 --> 00:10:01,763
Twice in two days?

267
00:10:01,798 --> 00:10:03,265
People are gonna get
the wrong idea.

268
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,716
Well, they can think what
they're gonna think,

269
00:10:04,768 --> 00:10:06,551
but it's not going to stop me
from giving my boy

270
00:10:06,603 --> 00:10:08,603
an engagement gift.

271
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:10,522
- You're giving me a case?
- It's not just any case.

272
00:10:10,557 --> 00:10:13,024
This is right up your alley.
Do-gooder lane.

273
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:14,809
- All right.
- Listen, Mike.

274
00:10:14,861 --> 00:10:16,645
These people got the shaft
for one reason.

275
00:10:16,697 --> 00:10:18,897
They're poor, and no one
gives a shit about 'em.

276
00:10:18,949 --> 00:10:21,466
They need a hero,
and you're that guy.

277
00:10:21,501 --> 00:10:22,567
Why aren't you that guy?

278
00:10:22,619 --> 00:10:24,235
Oh, I am that guy,

279
00:10:24,288 --> 00:10:26,571
but you're the one
getting married to Rachel Zane.

280
00:10:26,573 --> 00:10:28,907
The same Rachel Zane
that I almost got fired,

281
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:31,409
and then you gave me
a second chance.

282
00:10:31,461 --> 00:10:33,244
So this is your way
of making it up to me?

283
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,546
Listen, Mike,
talk to the plaintiffs,

284
00:10:34,581 --> 00:10:36,414
listen to their stories,
and I promise you

285
00:10:36,466 --> 00:10:38,466
it'll break
your little bleeding heart.

286
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:40,970
Thank you, Jimmy.

287
00:10:40,971 --> 00:10:42,420
Yeah, you bet.

288
00:10:42,472 --> 00:10:44,839
What if I can't get
Jessica to sign off?

289
00:10:44,891 --> 00:10:46,591
Then I'll just
take the case back

290
00:10:46,593 --> 00:10:48,677
and get you a decanter
or some shit.

291
00:10:50,814 --> 00:10:52,180
(Louis)
So it's unanimous.

292
00:10:52,232 --> 00:10:53,848
From now on,
all first-years are required

293
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:56,601
to bill 2,800 hours
and bring their own lunches.

294
00:10:56,603 --> 00:10:58,653
Congratulations, Louis,
another generation

295
00:10:58,689 --> 00:11:00,822
of associates
smacked into submission.

296
00:11:00,857 --> 00:11:02,657
Now, if you'll excuse me,

297
00:11:02,693 --> 00:11:04,159
I think I'm done
with this meeting.

298
00:11:04,194 --> 00:11:05,493
Harvey, please,
we still have new business.

299
00:11:05,529 --> 00:11:07,112
Speaking of which,
I'd like to propose a change

300
00:11:07,114 --> 00:11:09,614
to the current
compensation formula.

301
00:11:09,616 --> 00:11:10,949
Excuse me?

302
00:11:10,951 --> 00:11:12,500
Well, since taking over
the committee,

303
00:11:12,536 --> 00:11:14,452
I've been evaluating
pay structures,

304
00:11:14,504 --> 00:11:16,588
and I think it's high time
that this firm

305
00:11:16,623 --> 00:11:18,957
put a larger emphasis
on billable hours.

306
00:11:19,009 --> 00:11:21,626
Why don't you stick
to the 48th floor, Jack?

307
00:11:21,628 --> 00:11:23,962
I take it you have a problem
with my proposal.

308
00:11:24,014 --> 00:11:25,263
You're damn right I do.

309
00:11:25,298 --> 00:11:27,182
I just took on the sale
of a man's company,

310
00:11:27,217 --> 00:11:29,601
and my entire fee
is contingent-based.

311
00:11:29,636 --> 00:11:31,469
Because you operate
as your own entity,

312
00:11:31,521 --> 00:11:34,556
while the rest of us are members
of a team known as this firm.

313
00:11:34,608 --> 00:11:35,890
No, because I bring in

314
00:11:35,942 --> 00:11:37,442
a truckload of money
for this firm.

315
00:11:37,477 --> 00:11:39,944
Well, like I said, special rules
for Harvey Specter.

316
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:40,945
You know what, Jack?
That's enough.

317
00:11:40,981 --> 00:11:42,864
The current system works fine,

318
00:11:42,899 --> 00:11:43,865
and I don't appreciate
you speaking to Harvey

319
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,116
in such a disrespectful manner.

320
00:11:45,152 --> 00:11:46,701
- Are you shitting me?
- Harvey, I'm sorry.

321
00:11:46,737 --> 00:11:49,070
Save your sorries, Louis.
This meeting's over.

322
00:11:49,122 --> 00:11:50,455
Harvey, listen.
I'm on your side.

323
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:52,050
Yeah. I don't need you
on my side, okay?

324
00:11:52,075 --> 00:11:53,375
- I have shit to do.
- Wait.

325
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:54,376
I haven't even brought up
my proposal yet

326
00:11:54,411 --> 00:11:55,527
for the men's bathroom.

327
00:11:55,562 --> 00:11:57,328
You want to finish
being king for a day?

328
00:11:57,330 --> 00:11:58,413
Be my guest.

329
00:11:58,465 --> 00:12:00,665
Enjoy your coffee
and your 50 sugars,

330
00:12:00,717 --> 00:12:03,551
and go for it, but like I said,
I have shit to do.

331
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:13,144
Stanley was a good man.

332
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:15,063
Never missed a day of work,

333
00:12:15,098 --> 00:12:17,098
provided for his family.

334
00:12:18,602 --> 00:12:20,602
He didn't deserve
what happened to him.

335
00:12:22,572 --> 00:12:23,855
What did happen?

336
00:12:23,907 --> 00:12:25,256
Like I told the other lawyer,

337
00:12:25,292 --> 00:12:28,443
he went to the hospital
with chest pains.

338
00:12:28,495 --> 00:12:30,945
They said it was nothing.

339
00:12:30,997 --> 00:12:32,697
He kept complaining.

340
00:12:32,749 --> 00:12:35,266
Stanley never complained.

341
00:12:35,302 --> 00:12:38,336
Two days later
they released him.

342
00:12:38,371 --> 00:12:41,306
Stanley went to sleep
in our bed that night.

343
00:12:41,341 --> 00:12:44,259
And he never woke up.

344
00:12:44,294 --> 00:12:46,211
No.

345
00:12:46,213 --> 00:12:47,879
He didn't.

346
00:12:47,931 --> 00:12:49,764
Are you sure the hospital
released him

347
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,966
because the insurance company
cut his stay?

348
00:12:52,018 --> 00:12:54,352
He was sick, Mr. Ross,

349
00:12:54,387 --> 00:12:56,638
and they just sent him home.

350
00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:58,857
There are over 200 other people

351
00:12:58,892 --> 00:13:01,893
who had the exact same thing
happen to them.

352
00:13:01,895 --> 00:13:03,394
You think that's a coincidence?

353
00:13:03,396 --> 00:13:05,113
No, I don't,

354
00:13:05,148 --> 00:13:07,482
which is why I'm considering
reopening this case.

355
00:13:07,534 --> 00:13:10,068
So what's stopping you?

356
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,319
Well, for one thing,
I want to know

357
00:13:11,371 --> 00:13:12,704
why your other lawyer
dropped out.

358
00:13:12,739 --> 00:13:14,906
Because they worked that man
to the bone.

359
00:13:14,908 --> 00:13:17,242
He almost lost
his entire practice,

360
00:13:17,294 --> 00:13:20,745
but I was told that you're
with a big, powerful firm.

361
00:13:20,747 --> 00:13:23,631
I am...

362
00:13:23,667 --> 00:13:25,083
but I don't know
if I'm gonna be able

363
00:13:25,085 --> 00:13:26,801
to get them to sign off on this.

364
00:13:26,837 --> 00:13:29,804
So what are we supposed to do?

365
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,756
You're supposed to sit tight.

366
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,344
- What the hell was that?
- What are you talking about?

367
00:13:36,396 --> 00:13:37,929
You know exactly
what I'm talking about.

368
00:13:37,931 --> 00:13:38,980
You stormed out of the meeting

369
00:13:39,015 --> 00:13:40,098
that we were supposed
to run together.

370
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:41,900
I didn't storm out, I walked out

371
00:13:41,935 --> 00:13:44,018
because you were doing
a shitty job running it.

372
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:45,353
What are you talking about?
I had your back.

373
00:13:45,405 --> 00:13:47,605
After you let that clown
come after my salary.

374
00:13:47,657 --> 00:13:48,857
I didn't let him do anything.

375
00:13:48,909 --> 00:13:51,326
I defended you,
and then you smack me down,

376
00:13:51,361 --> 00:13:53,161
after which I had
to postpone a presentation

377
00:13:53,196 --> 00:13:54,579
that I was
very passionate about.

378
00:13:54,614 --> 00:13:57,582
It's a bathroom, Louis.
It smells sometimes.

379
00:13:57,617 --> 00:13:58,937
So why don't you
just go in there,

380
00:13:58,952 --> 00:14:00,702
do what people do in there,
and get out of my face?

381
00:14:00,754 --> 00:14:02,370
You know what?
Donna was right.

382
00:14:02,422 --> 00:14:04,839
I should have never tried
to make things right with you.

383
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:07,091
- Make things right with me?
- Yeah, Harvey.

384
00:14:07,127 --> 00:14:10,011
I let Jack do that so that
I could put him in his place

385
00:14:10,046 --> 00:14:12,463
and show you that I had
your back, but you can't see it

386
00:14:12,465 --> 00:14:14,799
because you're too damn jealous
of me and Donna.

387
00:14:14,801 --> 00:14:16,935
- What did you just say to me?
- You're jealous.

388
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:19,470
You know what, Louis,

389
00:14:19,523 --> 00:14:21,689
if I was so upset
about the two of you,

390
00:14:21,725 --> 00:14:23,641
why am I still paying
her salary?

391
00:14:23,693 --> 00:14:25,310
Bullshit.
The firm pays her salary.

392
00:14:25,312 --> 00:14:26,728
Not all of it.

393
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:29,147
You see, when I brought her
over here from the DA's office,

394
00:14:29,149 --> 00:14:31,282
Jessica wouldn't hire her
because I was an associate,

395
00:14:31,318 --> 00:14:33,034
so I paid her salary.

396
00:14:33,069 --> 00:14:34,319
And then I made partner,

397
00:14:34,371 --> 00:14:36,821
and I didn't think it
was enough, so I paid her more.

398
00:14:36,823 --> 00:14:40,158
And again and again and again.

399
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,410
So I've had enough
of you telling me I'm jealous.

400
00:14:42,462 --> 00:14:44,078
Yeah, well, Donna
doesn't work for you anymore.

401
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:45,380
She works for me,
and the only person

402
00:14:45,415 --> 00:14:47,549
who's gonna be taking care
of her salary... this guy.

403
00:14:47,584 --> 00:14:49,000
- You got that?
- Fine by me.

404
00:14:49,052 --> 00:14:50,585
But before you say that,

405
00:14:50,637 --> 00:14:52,420
you better know what you're
getting yourself into.

406
00:14:52,472 --> 00:14:54,138
Oh, yeah, I know what
I'm getting myself into,

407
00:14:54,174 --> 00:14:56,891
because you can't put a price
tag on a woman like that.

408
00:15:05,082 --> 00:15:06,132
I need to talk to you.

409
00:15:06,168 --> 00:15:07,300
Let me guess.

410
00:15:07,336 --> 00:15:09,169
You got into a pissing contest
with Harvey,

411
00:15:09,221 --> 00:15:11,504
he told you he's been
covering Donna's salary,

412
00:15:11,556 --> 00:15:13,840
you, out of pride, said that
you were going to take it on,

413
00:15:13,892 --> 00:15:15,425
and now you're here to find out
how much you're on the hook for.

414
00:15:15,477 --> 00:15:16,760
- Nothing like that.
- Oh, good.

415
00:15:16,762 --> 00:15:18,094
- Then what is it?
- Everything you just said.

416
00:15:18,096 --> 00:15:19,262
- Louis...
- Jessica, please.

417
00:15:19,264 --> 00:15:20,647
- I just want to see the number.
- Okay, Louis.

418
00:15:20,682 --> 00:15:21,865
You want to see the number?
Here's the number.

419
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:24,684
Thank y...
Holy goddamn shit.

420
00:15:24,736 --> 00:15:26,186
Are you sure you didn't
accidentally add a zero?

421
00:15:26,238 --> 00:15:28,238
Yes, I'm sure.

422
00:15:29,241 --> 00:15:30,357
Is there any way the firm can...

423
00:15:30,409 --> 00:15:32,192
The firm is not going
to pick this up.

424
00:15:32,244 --> 00:15:34,494
Harvey knew that, and he chose
to pay her more anyway.

425
00:15:34,529 --> 00:15:35,662
What the hell
am I supposed to do?

426
00:15:35,697 --> 00:15:37,163
Well, it seems to me
you have two options:

427
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,559
You can tell Donna that Harvey's
been augmenting her salary,

428
00:15:39,584 --> 00:15:40,700
and you don't want
to do it anymore.

429
00:15:40,752 --> 00:15:42,836
- Negatory.
- Or you can pay it yourself.

430
00:15:42,871 --> 00:15:44,587
- Not happening.
- There is a third option.

431
00:15:44,623 --> 00:15:46,706
I can send her back to Harvey.

432
00:15:46,758 --> 00:15:48,758
How dare you?

433
00:15:57,552 --> 00:15:59,386
(Louis)
What do you mean I'm not liquid?

434
00:15:59,438 --> 00:16:03,690
Who told you
to only save 10% cash?

435
00:16:03,725 --> 00:16:05,308
Well, I don't care what I said.

436
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:06,476
Does my podiatrist listen to me

437
00:16:06,478 --> 00:16:08,695
when I tell him
I have hammertoe?

438
00:16:09,865 --> 00:16:10,864
(Donna)
Is everything okay, Louis?

439
00:16:10,899 --> 00:16:13,149
- Everything's wonderful.
- Okay.

440
00:16:13,201 --> 00:16:15,452
Actually, it occurred to me

441
00:16:15,487 --> 00:16:18,872
that we have not discussed
a very important subject.

442
00:16:18,907 --> 00:16:20,957
What is it?

443
00:16:20,992 --> 00:16:23,960
Donna, money's
a very sensitive issue.

444
00:16:23,995 --> 00:16:25,161
Mm-hmm.

445
00:16:25,163 --> 00:16:26,663
And I think you should be
fairly compensated.

446
00:16:26,715 --> 00:16:29,716
I mean, I know how hard it was
for you to leave Harvey for me,

447
00:16:29,751 --> 00:16:31,334
and I am forever grateful.

448
00:16:31,336 --> 00:16:33,336
- It's just that I...
- Louis, shh.

449
00:16:33,338 --> 00:16:35,672
I don't need a huge raise.

450
00:16:35,674 --> 00:16:38,224
The standard 2%
is more than enough.

451
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:40,844
- 2%?
- Yes.

452
00:16:40,846 --> 00:16:42,345
You have a huge heart,

453
00:16:42,347 --> 00:16:44,931
but I already make more
than every other secretary

454
00:16:44,983 --> 00:16:46,182
at the firm, so...

455
00:16:46,184 --> 00:16:48,685
- 2% it is.
- Thanks, Louis.

456
00:16:48,737 --> 00:16:50,737
Don't mention it.

457
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,866
Hey, do you have a second?

458
00:17:02,918 --> 00:17:04,567
I need your legal advice
about something.

459
00:17:04,603 --> 00:17:06,836
Yeah, of course.
What is it?

460
00:17:06,872 --> 00:17:09,372
My fiancée left this prenup
in the kitchen.

461
00:17:09,374 --> 00:17:12,275
I'm just wondering
if you think I should sign it.

462
00:17:14,846 --> 00:17:16,379
Mike, it's not
what it looks like.

463
00:17:16,381 --> 00:17:18,298
It looks like your father
had a prenup prepared

464
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:19,716
for you to make me sign.

465
00:17:19,768 --> 00:17:21,217
Then it's exactly
what it looks like.

466
00:17:21,269 --> 00:17:22,852
And I'm guessing
you don't want me to sign it?

467
00:17:22,888 --> 00:17:24,220
No, I don't,

468
00:17:24,272 --> 00:17:26,222
because he's been trying
to control me my entire life,

469
00:17:26,224 --> 00:17:27,891
and I'm not gonna
let him do that with this.

470
00:17:27,943 --> 00:17:29,659
Has it occurred to you

471
00:17:29,694 --> 00:17:32,228
that maybe your father is only
doing this because he loves you?

472
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:33,730
I don't really care
why he's doing it.

473
00:17:33,782 --> 00:17:35,865
Great marriages
don't start with contracts.

474
00:17:35,901 --> 00:17:37,567
- I know that.
- Then why are you grilling me?

475
00:17:37,619 --> 00:17:39,235
Hey.

476
00:17:39,237 --> 00:17:41,538
Because there's a reason that
you didn't tell me about this,

477
00:17:41,573 --> 00:17:44,741
and I need to know what it is.

478
00:17:44,743 --> 00:17:47,243
My dad said
he doesn't know the man

479
00:17:47,245 --> 00:17:51,297
that I'm choosing to marry,

480
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:54,167
and I just...

481
00:17:54,219 --> 00:17:57,320
I didn't want to tell you that.

482
00:17:57,355 --> 00:18:01,140
- Well, I found out anyway.
- Yeah.

483
00:18:01,176 --> 00:18:04,594
Rachel, in the future,

484
00:18:04,646 --> 00:18:06,312
I want you to feel comfortable
telling me this stuff

485
00:18:06,348 --> 00:18:08,765
in the first place.

486
00:18:08,817 --> 00:18:10,600
I will.

487
00:18:18,944 --> 00:18:20,527
Mr. Specter, I wanted to...

488
00:18:20,579 --> 00:18:21,778
You're still here?

489
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:23,329
I don't leave until you leave.

490
00:18:23,365 --> 00:18:25,031
Well, in that case, what time
is my meeting with Adidas?

491
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:26,165
11:15.

492
00:18:26,201 --> 00:18:28,585
I moved your 11:00 to 3:00
and your 3:00 to 5:00.

493
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:29,586
- Did you line up...
- Buyers?

494
00:18:29,621 --> 00:18:31,454
I did but not for another week.

495
00:18:31,456 --> 00:18:33,039
Nike and Puma are overseas,
and you said

496
00:18:33,091 --> 00:18:34,707
Reebok didn't matter
if the other two can't be there.

497
00:18:34,759 --> 00:18:36,209
God damn it.

498
00:18:36,261 --> 00:18:38,127
- There's one more thing.
- What difference does it make?

499
00:18:38,179 --> 00:18:39,963
I can't delay the sale
if I don't know

500
00:18:40,015 --> 00:18:41,855
why my client is dumping
his company on a whim.

501
00:18:41,883 --> 00:18:43,683
That's the one more thing.

502
00:18:43,718 --> 00:18:45,268
Mr. Doyle's best friend died

503
00:18:45,303 --> 00:18:46,936
a month ago
of pancreatic cancer.

504
00:18:46,972 --> 00:18:48,354
He was 46.

505
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:49,606
How'd you know that?

506
00:18:49,641 --> 00:18:51,524
Something he said to you
just before he started

507
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,526
talking shit about me
stuck in my head.

508
00:18:53,562 --> 00:18:55,144
What exactly was that?

509
00:18:55,146 --> 00:18:57,814
When people say "life is short"
two times in 30 seconds,

510
00:18:57,866 --> 00:18:59,983
it's usually right
after somebody died.

511
00:18:59,985 --> 00:19:01,734
I take it you were listening
to our conversation.

512
00:19:01,786 --> 00:19:03,903
That's what good secretaries do.

513
00:19:03,955 --> 00:19:06,289
- Sorry about the Keebler thing.
- You didn't say it.

514
00:19:06,324 --> 00:19:08,491
Besides, it doesn't take
Albert Einstein to figure out

515
00:19:08,543 --> 00:19:10,326
why you hired somebody
that look like me

516
00:19:10,378 --> 00:19:11,961
to replace somebody
that look like her.

517
00:19:11,997 --> 00:19:13,079
Listen, Gretchen, I...

518
00:19:13,131 --> 00:19:15,298
You don't have to worry
about that with me.

519
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:17,333
I prefer my men manly.

520
00:19:19,337 --> 00:19:22,505
Am I not manly?

521
00:19:22,507 --> 00:19:24,507
Well, if you have to ask...

522
00:19:32,183 --> 00:19:34,350
Mike, how you doing?

523
00:19:34,352 --> 00:19:35,568
Robert.

524
00:19:35,604 --> 00:19:36,936
What can I do for you?

525
00:19:36,988 --> 00:19:39,272
I heard you wanted me
to sign a prenup.

526
00:19:39,324 --> 00:19:40,990
I did.

527
00:19:41,026 --> 00:19:42,108
I hope
you didn't take it personally.

528
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,776
Of course not,
I'm happy to sign it,

529
00:19:43,828 --> 00:19:45,194
but Rachel did say
that you don't know

530
00:19:45,246 --> 00:19:48,281
what kind of guy I am,
so I thought I'd come here

531
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:52,835
to show you that this is
the kind of guy I am.

532
00:19:52,871 --> 00:19:54,621
You're going
after Kelton Insurance?

533
00:19:54,673 --> 00:19:56,372
It's not about
who I'm going after.

534
00:19:56,374 --> 00:19:58,174
It's about who I'm representing.

535
00:19:58,209 --> 00:20:00,176
I'm putting my ass on the line
for 200 people

536
00:20:00,211 --> 00:20:02,011
who have no one to fight
for them other than me,

537
00:20:02,047 --> 00:20:03,796
so if you're worried that
I'd go after Rachel's money

538
00:20:03,848 --> 00:20:05,014
if something went wrong...

539
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:06,432
You're not that type of guy.

540
00:20:06,468 --> 00:20:07,934
No, I'm not.

541
00:20:07,969 --> 00:20:09,769
I respect that.

542
00:20:09,804 --> 00:20:10,887
Thank you, sir.

543
00:20:10,939 --> 00:20:13,306
But let me tell you something.

544
00:20:13,358 --> 00:20:16,309
I used to be one
of those people,

545
00:20:16,361 --> 00:20:19,562
and I scratched and clawed
my way to where I am today,

546
00:20:19,614 --> 00:20:21,147
which is why I know

547
00:20:21,199 --> 00:20:23,116
when you come from nothing
and you make yourself

548
00:20:23,151 --> 00:20:24,817
into something,
you're always waiting

549
00:20:24,869 --> 00:20:26,749
for the day they're gonna
come and take it away.

550
00:20:26,788 --> 00:20:29,372
I'm telling you
that I come from nothing,

551
00:20:29,407 --> 00:20:30,573
and I would never do that.

552
00:20:30,575 --> 00:20:32,375
I'm not saying
you're gonna take it.

553
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:33,543
I'm saying
you might do something

554
00:20:33,578 --> 00:20:35,244
that makes someone else take it.

555
00:20:35,246 --> 00:20:36,579
What do you mean?

556
00:20:36,581 --> 00:20:38,081
You're learning at the feet
of Harvey Specter

557
00:20:38,133 --> 00:20:39,382
and Jessica Pearson,

558
00:20:39,417 --> 00:20:40,667
and they know something I know.

559
00:20:40,719 --> 00:20:43,152
You're gonna be a great lawyer.

560
00:20:43,188 --> 00:20:46,222
You're gonna crack some eggs,

561
00:20:46,257 --> 00:20:47,924
and you never know
when someone's gonna come at you

562
00:20:47,926 --> 00:20:50,393
to take what's yours
for something you did.

563
00:20:50,428 --> 00:20:52,562
- Robert, I would never...
- Let me finish.

564
00:20:54,599 --> 00:20:57,233
I'm telling you this
because you're gonna be family.

565
00:20:57,268 --> 00:21:01,604
You might not have crossed
any lines yet, but you will.

566
00:21:01,606 --> 00:21:05,324
I'm just trying
to protect my baby girl.

567
00:21:07,529 --> 00:21:09,445
Jessica, you wanted to see me?

568
00:21:09,497 --> 00:21:11,581
Actually, Louis
wants to see both of us.

569
00:21:11,616 --> 00:21:12,865
(Harvey)
Then let's get it over with.

570
00:21:12,917 --> 00:21:14,534
Okay.

571
00:21:14,586 --> 00:21:15,952
I would like to propose

572
00:21:16,004 --> 00:21:17,453
a revamping of the pay structure

573
00:21:17,455 --> 00:21:19,122
under the following guidelines.

574
00:21:19,174 --> 00:21:21,874
We increase the percentage
of billables the partners get.

575
00:21:21,926 --> 00:21:24,127
We decrease the percentage
of contingent fees

576
00:21:24,129 --> 00:21:25,762
- by an offsetting amount.
- What?

577
00:21:25,797 --> 00:21:26,929
That's what Jack Soloff
said yesterday.

578
00:21:26,965 --> 00:21:28,297
No, this is different.

579
00:21:28,299 --> 00:21:30,600
I've capped the amount
it affects any one partner.

580
00:21:30,635 --> 00:21:31,968
You got to be shitting me.

581
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:33,770
I know you're wondering why
I'm proposing this.

582
00:21:33,805 --> 00:21:35,972
It's crystal clear
why you're proposing it.

583
00:21:36,024 --> 00:21:38,474
You get the exact amount
to cover Donna's salary,

584
00:21:38,526 --> 00:21:39,559
and you take it
out of my paycheck.

585
00:21:39,611 --> 00:21:40,611
Louis...

586
00:21:40,612 --> 00:21:41,561
This has nothing to do
with that.

587
00:21:41,613 --> 00:21:42,613
Jack had a great idea.

588
00:21:42,647 --> 00:21:43,730
It just needed
some fine-tuning.

589
00:21:43,782 --> 00:21:45,348
Fine-tuning?
You're the one that said

590
00:21:45,383 --> 00:21:46,866
you only let him bring it up

591
00:21:46,901 --> 00:21:48,234
so that you can smack it down.

592
00:21:48,286 --> 00:21:49,485
Is that true?

593
00:21:49,487 --> 00:21:51,654
Yes. Maybe, but I had
some time to think about it.

594
00:21:51,706 --> 00:21:52,989
Jack put something on the table,

595
00:21:53,041 --> 00:21:54,457
and it's our duty
to follow through on it.

596
00:21:54,492 --> 00:21:56,492
Oh, bullshit... you're only
following through on it

597
00:21:56,544 --> 00:21:57,960
because you're a cheap
son of a bitch.

598
00:21:57,996 --> 00:21:58,996
Harvey.

599
00:21:58,997 --> 00:22:00,129
I don't want to hear it,
Jessica.

600
00:22:00,165 --> 00:22:01,831
Yesterday, he accused me
of being jealous.

601
00:22:01,883 --> 00:22:03,203
Today, he's coming
after my money.

602
00:22:03,218 --> 00:22:04,467
- No, I'm not...
- Shut up.

603
00:22:04,502 --> 00:22:06,469
We both know Donna
going to work for you

604
00:22:06,504 --> 00:22:07,670
has nothing to do with you.

605
00:22:07,722 --> 00:22:09,138
- You got lucky.
- Lucky?

606
00:22:09,174 --> 00:22:10,923
Like a monkey
who won the lottery,

607
00:22:10,975 --> 00:22:13,509
so the least you can do is
be a man, pay her yourself,

608
00:22:13,511 --> 00:22:15,261
or suck it up
and tell her the truth.

609
00:22:15,313 --> 00:22:16,429
(Jessica) All right. That's enough.
We're not doing this.

610
00:22:16,481 --> 00:22:17,681
- I am a name partner.
- Louis.

611
00:22:17,682 --> 00:22:19,015
No. He has no right to...

612
00:22:19,050 --> 00:22:21,517
I will slap the taste
out of your mouth.

613
00:22:27,325 --> 00:22:28,407
Thanks, Jessica.

614
00:22:28,443 --> 00:22:30,026
I appreciate you being
on the same page.

615
00:22:30,028 --> 00:22:31,027
Oh, we're not on the same page.

616
00:22:31,079 --> 00:22:32,411
What are you talking about?

617
00:22:32,447 --> 00:22:33,863
I wanted the two of you
to run that meeting yesterday

618
00:22:33,865 --> 00:22:36,065
to see if you were okay
with each other, but you're not.

619
00:22:36,084 --> 00:22:38,668
He may be cheap, but he's right.

620
00:22:38,703 --> 00:22:40,419
You are taking your
Donna anger out on him,

621
00:22:40,455 --> 00:22:41,871
and it needs to stop.

622
00:22:41,923 --> 00:22:42,923
I don't have Donna anger.

623
00:22:42,924 --> 00:22:44,540
Oh, like hell you don't.

624
00:22:44,592 --> 00:22:46,342
And if you don't admit that
to yourself,

625
00:22:46,377 --> 00:22:48,795
I'll slap the taste
out of your mouth too.

626
00:22:58,265 --> 00:23:01,234
What you working on there, Mike?

627
00:23:01,269 --> 00:23:05,271
Um, nothing.
Just some cleanup.

628
00:23:05,323 --> 00:23:06,523
What can I do for you, Jessica?

629
00:23:06,575 --> 00:23:08,741
You can tell me why
you reopened a case

630
00:23:08,777 --> 00:23:10,109
against a major
insurance company

631
00:23:10,161 --> 00:23:13,279
we were never a part of
to start with.

632
00:23:13,281 --> 00:23:14,948
Um, I reopened it

633
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:17,083
because I looked at it
and it's a winner.

634
00:23:17,118 --> 00:23:18,284
Well, I also looked at it,

635
00:23:18,286 --> 00:23:20,703
and I say it's a loser.

636
00:23:20,755 --> 00:23:21,755
Jessica, look...

637
00:23:21,756 --> 00:23:22,922
You took a case on contingency

638
00:23:22,958 --> 00:23:25,625
where every plaintiff
is dirt poor,

639
00:23:25,677 --> 00:23:27,176
which means, even if we win,

640
00:23:27,212 --> 00:23:29,128
compensation for lost wages
is nothing.

641
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:30,463
You're leaving out
punitive damages,

642
00:23:30,515 --> 00:23:32,715
and Harvey takes cases
on contingency all the time.

643
00:23:32,767 --> 00:23:34,384
Yeah, he takes them
to make money,

644
00:23:34,436 --> 00:23:35,802
not to save kittens in trees.

645
00:23:35,854 --> 00:23:37,971
And I just told you
this is going to make money.

646
00:23:37,973 --> 00:23:39,556
And that's what you said
about Liberty Rail,

647
00:23:39,608 --> 00:23:40,773
and instead of making money,

648
00:23:40,809 --> 00:23:42,742
it almost ended
with Donna behind bars.

649
00:23:42,777 --> 00:23:44,644
No one is going to jail
for this.

650
00:23:44,696 --> 00:23:47,363
No, they're not, because it's
going to cost a fortune to fund,

651
00:23:47,399 --> 00:23:49,949
and I'm not laying out that kind
of money on a long shot.

652
00:23:49,985 --> 00:23:51,818
Jessica, look.
I promised myself that I...

653
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:53,536
I don't care who you promised.

654
00:23:53,572 --> 00:23:55,655
You took this case
without running it by me,

655
00:23:55,657 --> 00:23:57,790
and you did it
because you knew I'd say no.

656
00:23:57,826 --> 00:23:59,459
- Jessica...
- So that's enough.

657
00:23:59,494 --> 00:24:02,495
Dump it, or I will.

658
00:24:11,089 --> 00:24:13,006
I need to talk to you.

659
00:24:13,058 --> 00:24:14,340
Really?

660
00:24:14,392 --> 00:24:15,592
'Cause the last time
you talked to me,

661
00:24:15,644 --> 00:24:17,927
you told me to open my mouth,
and you slammed it shut.

662
00:24:17,979 --> 00:24:20,396
Because you wanted to go after
Harvey, but now I'm on board.

663
00:24:20,432 --> 00:24:22,899
- Why should I believe you?
- Answer me this.

664
00:24:22,934 --> 00:24:24,567
How many partners
do you have in your pocket,

665
00:24:24,603 --> 00:24:26,235
if we put your proposal
to a vote?

666
00:24:26,271 --> 00:24:27,604
I can get 45%.

667
00:24:27,656 --> 00:24:28,855
Well, then the reason
you can believe me

668
00:24:28,857 --> 00:24:30,106
is that I'm gonna get you
the difference.

669
00:24:30,158 --> 00:24:32,191
How you gonna do that
if you don't have the courage

670
00:24:32,193 --> 00:24:33,910
to back my plan
at your own meeting?

671
00:24:33,945 --> 00:24:35,995
By showing everyone
at this firm exactly

672
00:24:36,031 --> 00:24:37,280
what Harvey makes.

673
00:24:37,332 --> 00:24:38,531
[chuckles]

674
00:24:38,533 --> 00:24:40,617
Now I know
you're bullshitting me.

675
00:24:40,669 --> 00:24:42,669
You'd be fired if you did that.

676
00:24:42,704 --> 00:24:44,420
Not if I do it by accident.

677
00:24:49,127 --> 00:24:50,793
Can you believe
that sneaker brings in

678
00:24:50,845 --> 00:24:52,879
over a billion dollars
from China alone?

679
00:24:52,881 --> 00:24:54,547
With earnings like that,
makes me wonder

680
00:24:54,599 --> 00:24:56,933
why you're trying
to rip off my client.

681
00:24:56,968 --> 00:24:58,635
Buying a man's company
for a fair price

682
00:24:58,687 --> 00:25:00,269
is hardly ripping him off.

683
00:25:00,305 --> 00:25:02,021
But it's not a fair price.

684
00:25:02,057 --> 00:25:04,774
You gave my client 48 hours
to take your offer.

685
00:25:04,809 --> 00:25:06,943
I'm gonna give you five minutes
to take mine.

686
00:25:06,978 --> 00:25:08,778
Double your money,
or I walk out the door.

687

That's ridiculous.

688

Then let me counsel you on this.

692
00:25:17,155 --> 00:25:18,988
Because he's grieving,
I have the ability

693
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,560
to go to the board
and delay this sale.

694
00:25:20,575 --> 00:25:22,125
But you're not going to,
because you know

695
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,993
it'll drive down
the price even more

696
00:25:24,045 --> 00:25:26,412
when he eventually
wants to sell anyway.

697
00:25:26,414 --> 00:25:28,581
You're right, it will,

698
00:25:28,633 --> 00:25:30,383
but I'll tell you what,
Mr. Polk,

699
00:25:30,418 --> 00:25:32,418
it'll still be worth
more than your offer.

700
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:35,054
And after my client's grief
passes,

701
00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:37,140
he may still want to sell,

702
00:25:37,175 --> 00:25:38,675

No, you're not.

Jonathan,
I could have gone anywhere.

I came to you for the same
reason I went to Walter Gillis,

to make it right.

729

What the hell is this?

736
00:27:33,508 --> 00:27:34,874
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

737
00:27:34,876 --> 00:27:37,343
Yes, you do. This is Harvey's
last three income statements,

738
00:27:37,378 --> 00:27:39,295
and I found them sitting
in the copy machine.

739
00:27:39,347 --> 00:27:40,630
Donna, I need you to put that
back where you found it,

740
00:27:40,682 --> 00:27:42,715
and I need you
to put it back now.

741
00:27:42,717 --> 00:27:44,467
- I won't do it.
- That was not a request.

742
00:27:44,519 --> 00:27:45,551
- That was an order.
- I don't care.

743
00:27:45,603 --> 00:27:47,436
- I'm not gonna let you do this.
- See?

744
00:27:47,472 --> 00:27:49,355
I knew that you would jump
at the first opportunity

745
00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:50,890
you had to take his side
over mine.

746
00:27:50,892 --> 00:27:52,725
This isn't me
taking Harvey's side.

747
00:27:52,727 --> 00:27:55,895
This is me stopping you
from making a huge mistake.

748
00:27:55,897 --> 00:27:58,030
And if he did the same thing,
you wouldn't be stopping him.

749
00:27:58,066 --> 00:27:59,949
Harvey would never
do anything like this,

750
00:27:59,984 --> 00:28:01,567
and if he did,
I sure as hell would.

751
00:28:01,619 --> 00:28:03,069
- Oh, bullshit.
- No, Louis.

752
00:28:03,121 --> 00:28:04,237
It's not bullshit.

753
00:28:04,239 --> 00:28:06,539
You have no idea how many times

754
00:28:06,574 --> 00:28:08,374
I kept him from
going overboard with you.

755
00:28:08,409 --> 00:28:10,449
- It was half my goddamn job.
- Well, you know what?

756
00:28:10,461 --> 00:28:11,661
You didn't stop him every time,

757
00:28:11,663 --> 00:28:13,103
and you're not stopping me
this time.

758
00:28:13,131 --> 00:28:15,298
Now, give me that thing.

759
00:28:15,333 --> 00:28:16,666
Okay. Fine.
You don't want to put it back?

760
00:28:16,718 --> 00:28:17,750
- I'll do it myself.
- Louis...

761
00:28:17,802 --> 00:28:18,968
No. Donna, you know what?

762
00:28:19,003 --> 00:28:20,586
You came to work for me.

763
00:28:20,588 --> 00:28:21,888
You knew who I was when you did,

764
00:28:21,923 --> 00:28:23,256
so now it's time
for you to decide.

765
00:28:23,258 --> 00:28:24,390
Are you with me or not?

766
00:28:49,785 --> 00:28:52,370
While I'm not opposed to
unexpected gifts on my desk,

767
00:28:52,372 --> 00:28:54,789
I do prefer
if they're made of chocolate.

768
00:28:54,841 --> 00:28:55,841
Got it.

769
00:28:55,842 --> 00:28:58,376
Next time I leave you
a signed prenup,

770
00:28:58,428 --> 00:28:59,678
it will be made of chocolate.

771
00:28:59,713 --> 00:29:03,465
Why did you sign it?

772
00:29:03,517 --> 00:29:05,600
- I went to see your dad.
- You did what?

773
00:29:05,635 --> 00:29:06,885
I wanted to show him

774
00:29:06,887 --> 00:29:08,853
what kind of man
his daughter was marrying,

775
00:29:08,889 --> 00:29:10,305
because I wanted him
to trust me.

776
00:29:10,357 --> 00:29:13,975
Mike, he doesn't trust anybody,
which is exactly why

777
00:29:14,027 --> 00:29:17,062
I'm not interested
in his marital advice.

778
00:29:17,064 --> 00:29:19,647
But like you said,
I would appreciate it

779
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:21,199
if in the future,

780
00:29:21,234 --> 00:29:23,651
you tell me if you're gonna
do something like that.

781
00:29:23,704 --> 00:29:26,404
You're right, I should have told
you before I went over there,

782
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:29,741
but for the record, instead of
getting him to trust me,

783
00:29:29,793 --> 00:29:31,543
I ended up trusting him.

784
00:29:31,578 --> 00:29:32,961
- Mike...
- Rachel, listen to me.

785
00:29:32,996 --> 00:29:35,747
I know you think that
he's doing this to control you,

786
00:29:35,749 --> 00:29:41,152
but he thinks he's doing it
to protect you.

787
00:29:41,188 --> 00:29:43,588
And the truth is
that I never had a father

788
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:47,258
who could do something
like that for me, so...

789
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:50,595
I think that you should try
and see where he's coming from.

790
00:30:07,164 --> 00:30:09,330
What's that?

791
00:30:09,366 --> 00:30:11,950
It's your new offer.

792
00:30:11,952 --> 00:30:16,087
- It's twice the money.
- It's what I do.

793
00:30:16,123 --> 00:30:18,206
And that's why
I pay you so much.

794
00:30:18,258 --> 00:30:19,841
I didn't do it
for the money, Teddy.

795
00:30:19,876 --> 00:30:21,459
I did it because you
were getting ripped off,

796
00:30:21,511 --> 00:30:22,710
and I'm not gonna let
that happen to you,

797
00:30:22,763 --> 00:30:27,132
no matter what
the circumstances.

798
00:30:27,134 --> 00:30:28,466
You found out.

799
00:30:28,468 --> 00:30:31,469
Why didn't you
tell me what happened?

800
00:30:31,521 --> 00:30:34,389
Because I didn't want you
to try and stop me.

801
00:30:34,441 --> 00:30:36,057
You still could have come to me.

802
00:30:36,109 --> 00:30:37,358
And tell you what?

803
00:30:37,394 --> 00:30:39,694
That my best friend
from when we were seven died

804
00:30:39,729 --> 00:30:41,563
out of the blue?

805
00:30:41,615 --> 00:30:43,231
I hadn't spoken to him
in 20 years,

806
00:30:43,283 --> 00:30:45,233
because we got into a fight

807
00:30:45,285 --> 00:30:49,320
over some woman whose name
I can't even remember.

808
00:30:49,372 --> 00:30:51,956
And now I don't give a shit
about the sneaker business.

809
00:30:51,992 --> 00:30:53,875
Well, I would have understood.

810

you did for me.

If I'm ever back in business,
you'll always be my lawyer.

814
00:31:06,506 --> 00:31:08,923
I'll always be your friend.

815
00:31:15,015 --> 00:31:17,315
- Louis, do you have a second?
- Oh, I don't know.

816
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:19,601

call me now? An iguana?

817

00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:10,595
You know what I think?

860
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:13,398
I think this has nothing
to do with your dad,

861
00:33:13,433 --> 00:33:15,433
and you know it.

862
00:33:19,806 --> 00:33:20,806
Mike.

863
00:33:20,857 --> 00:33:24,726
Yes. Mike.

864
00:33:24,778 --> 00:33:27,395
That's the real reason
why you're coming to me,

865
00:33:27,447 --> 00:33:29,314
even though
you told yourself it wasn't.

866
00:33:29,316 --> 00:33:32,383
- It could protect me.
- It could.

867
00:33:32,419 --> 00:33:35,320
It could also do something else.

868
00:33:35,355 --> 00:33:37,588
Undermine my relationship.

869
00:33:37,624 --> 00:33:39,190
Believe me.

870
00:33:39,225 --> 00:33:42,160
I learned that one the hard way,

871
00:33:42,195 --> 00:33:44,996
which means you need
to ask yourself,

872
00:33:45,031 --> 00:33:49,567
how much do you
really love Mike?

873
00:33:49,602 --> 00:33:52,737
I love him all the way.

874
00:33:52,772 --> 00:33:54,772
Then don't sign it.

875
00:33:58,611 --> 00:34:00,611
On the house.

876
00:34:04,067 --> 00:34:06,517
And, Rachel,
as far as your father goes,

877
00:34:06,569 --> 00:34:09,253
he and I don't always
see eye to eye,

878
00:34:09,289 --> 00:34:11,723
but I do respect that man.

879
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:14,292
And if he is anything
like my father,

880
00:34:14,327 --> 00:34:15,626
for all of his faults,

881
00:34:15,662 --> 00:34:17,061
he would take a bullet

882
00:34:17,097 --> 00:34:20,865
before he'd let anything
happen to his little girl.

883
00:34:20,917 --> 00:34:22,917
Thank you.

884
00:34:31,878 --> 00:34:33,127
Uh, okay.

885
00:34:33,179 --> 00:34:34,879
Harold and I ponied up last time

886
00:34:34,881 --> 00:34:36,547
because it was
a special occasion,

887
00:34:36,599 --> 00:34:38,266
but tonight drinks
are on you, my friend.

888
00:34:38,301 --> 00:34:39,684
That's fair.

889
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:43,471
As much as I appreciate it,
Jimmy, I got to return the gift.

890
00:34:43,523 --> 00:34:44,856
- What?
- Yeah.

891
00:34:44,891 --> 00:34:45,973
- I can't take the case.
- No, no, no.

892
00:34:46,026 --> 00:34:47,442
What do you mean
you can't take the case?

893
00:34:47,477 --> 00:34:49,310
Jessica won't lay out
the money for the man hours.

894
00:34:49,362 --> 00:34:51,396
Okay, then get somebody else
to lay out the money.

895
00:34:51,398 --> 00:34:53,731
Mike, investment banks
are taking stakes

896
00:34:53,783 --> 00:34:54,783
in shit like this now.

897
00:34:54,784 --> 00:34:55,900
You, of all people,
should know that.

898
00:34:55,902 --> 00:34:56,984
You think I didn't try that?

899
00:34:57,037 --> 00:34:58,236
It didn't work.

900
00:34:58,238 --> 00:35:00,405
God damn it, Mike.

901
00:35:00,457 --> 00:35:02,623
You always said
you gave a shit about people.

902
00:35:02,659 --> 00:35:04,125
And you said that
I could return this case.

903
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,577
I don't care what I said.

904
00:35:06,579 --> 00:35:08,413
Jimmy,

905
00:35:08,465 --> 00:35:10,715
what the hell is going on here?

906
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:13,084
Okay. One of the victims
was my uncle Keith,

907
00:35:13,086 --> 00:35:15,053
but I didn't tell you about him
because my cousin came to me

908
00:35:15,088 --> 00:35:16,637
and asked me to make it right,

909
00:35:16,673 --> 00:35:20,591
and I promised her that I would.

910
00:35:20,627 --> 00:35:23,895
It's just I don't have the juice
at my firm,

911
00:35:23,930 --> 00:35:25,646
and I was...

912
00:35:25,682 --> 00:35:27,098
I was too ashamed to tell you.

913
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:29,834
- Jimmy...
- No, Mike, listen.

914
00:35:29,869 --> 00:35:32,270
Look, I'm sorry
I didn't tell you straight up.

915
00:35:32,322 --> 00:35:35,323
But, please,
these people need your help.

916
00:35:41,498 --> 00:35:43,614
What can I do for you, Jack?

917
00:35:43,616 --> 00:35:46,084
You can explain to me

918
00:35:46,119 --> 00:35:48,953
how the hell you justify
making this much money.

919
00:35:49,005 --> 00:35:50,455
Where'd you get this?

920
00:35:50,507 --> 00:35:51,956
Was left in the copy machine.

921
00:35:52,008 --> 00:35:53,674
- By who?
- I don't know.

922
00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:55,293
But now I do know why you pissed

923
00:35:55,345 --> 00:35:56,794
all over my idea at the meeting.

924
00:35:56,846 --> 00:35:58,463
This is confidential.

925
00:35:58,515 --> 00:36:00,381
It was confidential.

926
00:36:00,433 --> 00:36:02,800
Now, every senior partner's
seen it,

927
00:36:02,802 --> 00:36:04,302
and people are furious.

928
00:36:04,304 --> 00:36:05,937
I earn every penny I make.

929
00:36:05,972 --> 00:36:08,306
We'll see about that.

930
00:36:08,308 --> 00:36:09,524
What are you talking about?

931
00:36:09,559 --> 00:36:13,478
I just called for a vote
tomorrow on my proposal,

932
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:15,029
and I hope you've been
saving your money,

933
00:36:15,064 --> 00:36:18,533
because your gravy train's
about to leave the station.

934
00:36:35,071 --> 00:36:36,839
So this is why you said,
"Oh, shit."

935
00:36:36,841 --> 00:36:38,007
What's that?

936
00:36:38,009 --> 00:36:39,575
Oh, you know what it is,

937
00:36:39,610 --> 00:36:41,010
because you're the one
who left it

938
00:36:41,062 --> 00:36:42,645
in the goddamn copier.

939
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:45,014
Oh, my God, Harvey,
I was making copies

940
00:36:45,066 --> 00:36:47,016
of everyone's salaries for
my records, and I must have...

941
00:36:47,068 --> 00:36:48,184
Bullshit, Louis.

942
00:36:48,186 --> 00:36:49,935
You did this to come after me,

943
00:36:49,987 --> 00:36:52,855
and after I apologized,
you ran and tried to stop it.

944
00:36:52,857 --> 00:36:55,074
Harvey, please,
what's done is done,

945
00:36:55,109 --> 00:36:56,525
and like you said before,
we're friends.

946
00:36:56,527 --> 00:36:58,828
We can move past this, and we
can fight the vote together.

947
00:36:58,863 --> 00:37:01,197
There's no way I win the vote
after people see this.

948
00:37:01,249 --> 00:37:02,832
You want to get past it?
Admit what you did.

949
00:37:02,867 --> 00:37:04,366
That's automatic termination.

950
00:37:04,418 --> 00:37:05,534
Then we'll fight that together.

951
00:37:05,536 --> 00:37:06,535
- Harvey, I can't.
- Louis!

952
00:37:06,537 --> 00:37:08,087
Jessica tried to fire me once.

953
00:37:08,122 --> 00:37:09,538
I can't give her the chance
to do that again.

954
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:10,540
Well, you know what?

955
00:37:10,541 --> 00:37:12,374
It's gonna happen again,

956
00:37:12,376 --> 00:37:15,010
because I know what you did.

957
00:37:15,046 --> 00:37:17,630
You know what?
That's enough.

958
00:37:17,682 --> 00:37:19,215
And you come at me
flinging accusations,

959
00:37:19,217 --> 00:37:20,382
well, you better have proof.

960
00:37:20,434 --> 00:37:21,851
You have proof, Harvey?

961
00:37:21,886 --> 00:37:24,603
Yeah, I didn't think so.

962
00:37:24,639 --> 00:37:27,640
[knocking on door]

963
00:37:29,861 --> 00:37:30,943
Harvey, you don't get
to come to me

964
00:37:30,978 --> 00:37:31,944
at all hours
of the night anymore.

965
00:37:31,979 --> 00:37:33,646
I'm here
because your new boss...

966
00:37:33,698 --> 00:37:35,397
- I know why you're here.
- Then you know what he did.

967
00:37:35,399 --> 00:37:36,482
And I need you to admit it,

968
00:37:36,534 --> 00:37:38,367
so I can block
their bullshit vote.

969
00:37:38,402 --> 00:37:39,985
And get Louis fired?

970
00:37:40,037 --> 00:37:42,154
He wouldn't be in this mess
if you'd have just stopped him

971
00:37:42,206 --> 00:37:43,572
from doing this
in the first place.

972
00:37:43,624 --> 00:37:46,125
Harvey, if I knew Louis was
gonna do something like this,

973
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,409
and I'm not saying I did,

974
00:37:47,461 --> 00:37:49,545
then I would have
told him to his face not to.

975
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:50,913
But if he went ahead
and did it anyway,

976
00:37:50,915 --> 00:37:52,715
then I'm not gonna
go behind his back to fix it.

977
00:37:52,750 --> 00:37:54,917
Because you always said,
"Once you pick a side,

978
00:37:54,919 --> 00:37:56,252
"if you're not loyal
to that side,

979
00:37:56,304 --> 00:37:57,253
then who the hell are you?"

980
00:37:57,305 --> 00:37:58,637
Then you should have
thought of that

981
00:37:58,673 --> 00:38:00,256
before you picked someone who
would do something like this

982
00:38:00,258 --> 00:38:01,757
in the first place.

983
00:38:01,759 --> 00:38:04,176
You want to know
what kind of man Louis is?

984
00:38:04,228 --> 00:38:06,428
This whole thing started
because he wanted to prove

985
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,563
to you that he had your back,

986
00:38:07,598 --> 00:38:09,515
because he thought
you were jealous of us.

987
00:38:09,567 --> 00:38:12,151
No, this whole thing started

988
00:38:12,186 --> 00:38:15,237
because I told him that
I've been paying your salary

989
00:38:15,273 --> 00:38:16,939
since we came to the firm,

990
00:38:16,941 --> 00:38:19,775
and he was too cheap
to pay it himself and too weak

991
00:38:19,827 --> 00:38:23,662
to tell you the truth.

992
00:38:23,698 --> 00:38:25,714
And if you've kept that
from me for 12 years

993
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:29,535
and you're only just telling me
now, then maybe you are jealous.

994
00:38:34,625 --> 00:38:37,626
Mike, how'd you get in?
Give you a key already?

995
00:38:37,678 --> 00:38:40,462
No. Laura let me in.
She said you'd be back here.

996
00:38:40,464 --> 00:38:41,464
I don't know why.

997
00:38:41,515 --> 00:38:44,466
I'm trying
to find something tasty.

998
00:38:44,518 --> 00:38:46,936
There's not one damn thing
that's bad for you

999
00:38:46,971 --> 00:38:48,103
in this entire house.

1000
00:38:48,139 --> 00:38:49,355
Then I guess it's a good thing

1001
00:38:49,390 --> 00:38:52,308
I didn't tell her
that I brought you these.

1002
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:56,278
Oh, chicken nuggets.

1003
00:38:56,314 --> 00:38:57,980
Rachel made them herself.

1004
00:38:58,032 --> 00:39:00,232
Deep-fried, not baked?

1005
00:39:00,284 --> 00:39:01,367
You're welcome.

1006
00:39:01,402 --> 00:39:02,868
She sign that prenup?

1007
00:39:02,903 --> 00:39:06,572
No, but she sent those
because she realized the prenup

1008
00:39:06,624 --> 00:39:09,825
was about love, not control.

1009
00:39:09,827 --> 00:39:13,045
Then I respect her decision.

1010
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:14,463
What changed her mind about me?

1011
00:39:14,498 --> 00:39:15,881
You really want to know?

1012
00:39:15,916 --> 00:39:17,232
- Mm-hmm.
- Jessica.

1013
00:39:17,268 --> 00:39:18,751
Oh, shit.
What did she say?

1014
00:39:18,803 --> 00:39:20,502
I got to know that secret.

1015
00:39:20,504 --> 00:39:21,754
I don't know
what she said to Rachel,

1016
00:39:21,806 --> 00:39:25,140
but I know what she said to me.

1017
00:39:25,176 --> 00:39:27,142
So that's why you're here.

1018
00:39:27,178 --> 00:39:30,346
You know those people that
I told you I was fighting for?

1019
00:39:31,816 --> 00:39:33,349
[sighs]

1020
00:39:33,351 --> 00:39:35,651
Jessica's not gonna go for it.

1021
00:39:35,686 --> 00:39:36,919
I get it.

1022
00:39:36,954 --> 00:39:39,488
Too much money to lay out
for too little payoff.

1023
00:39:39,523 --> 00:39:44,159
But you said you came from
the same place as these people.

1024
00:39:44,195 --> 00:39:48,447
Robert, they need someone
like you to fight for them,

1025
00:39:48,499 --> 00:39:51,333
and I can't do it.

1026
00:39:51,369 --> 00:39:53,952
So I'm asking you to.

1027
00:39:54,005 --> 00:39:55,245
You think this case is a winner?

1028
00:39:55,256 --> 00:39:56,839
I do.

1029
00:39:58,376 --> 00:40:00,709
Then what do you say
we do it together?

1030
00:40:03,547 --> 00:40:04,880
What are you doing here, Louis?

1031
00:40:04,882 --> 00:40:06,765
I notice you didn't come
to the vote this morning.

1032
00:40:06,801 --> 00:40:09,601
No, I didn't. I was busy
closing a deal for my client.

1033
00:40:09,637 --> 00:40:11,770
Let me guess. You had 'em
backdate your sale to yesterday,

1034
00:40:11,806 --> 00:40:13,222
so it falls
under your old pay structure?

1035
00:40:13,274 --> 00:40:14,874
No, Louis,
that's something you would do,

1036
00:40:14,892 --> 00:40:17,726
because unlike you, I don't
actually care about the money.

1037
00:40:17,728 --> 00:40:19,061
You expect me to believe that?

1038
00:40:19,113 --> 00:40:20,646
I don't care whether you
believe it or not.

1039
00:40:20,698 --> 00:40:23,899
My compensation package
was about recognizing what I do.

1040
00:40:23,951 --> 00:40:25,234
Money was just a consequence.

1041
00:40:25,286 --> 00:40:26,952
That's why I didn't mind
sharing it with Donna.

1042
00:40:26,987 --> 00:40:28,454
- Now, get out.
- No.

1043
00:40:28,489 --> 00:40:31,290
You did care about the money,
because it was the last thing

1044
00:40:31,325 --> 00:40:33,292
you had that separated you
from me.

1045
00:40:33,327 --> 00:40:35,544
- Excuse me?
- I got name partner.

1046
00:40:35,579 --> 00:40:38,247
I got Donna,
and that drove you nuts.

1047
00:40:38,299 --> 00:40:40,332
So you shit on me
at the meeting,

1048
00:40:40,384 --> 00:40:42,301
and then you pretended
to apologize.

1049
00:40:42,336 --> 00:40:43,836
I did apologize, Louis.

1050
00:40:43,888 --> 00:40:45,421
I came to you like a man,

1051
00:40:45,473 --> 00:40:48,173
and then when I gave you
the chance to make it up to me,

1052
00:40:48,225 --> 00:40:50,309
you choked, like you always do.

1053
00:40:50,344 --> 00:40:51,677
Well, how you like me now?

1054
00:40:51,729 --> 00:40:53,979
Because the only thing you
had left was that you made more.

1055
00:40:54,014 --> 00:40:55,681
And now you don't, and I win.

1056
00:40:55,733 --> 00:40:59,101
You didn't win anything.

1057
00:40:59,153 --> 00:41:00,486
What are you talking about?

1058
00:41:00,521 --> 00:41:03,605
I'm talking about the fact
that no matter what you get,

1059
00:41:03,657 --> 00:41:05,324
you're always wanting more.

1060
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:07,659
And the problem
with always wanting more is

1061
00:41:07,695 --> 00:41:10,279
that the second you get it,
it can always be taken away.

1062
00:41:10,281 --> 00:41:11,530
You're not reversing that vote.

1063
00:41:11,582 --> 00:41:12,915
I'm not talking about the vote.

1064
00:41:12,950 --> 00:41:16,285
I'm talking
about what you value most.

1065
00:41:16,337 --> 00:41:17,337
That's right.

1066
00:41:17,338 --> 00:41:19,621
Might not happen today
or tomorrow,

1067
00:41:19,673 --> 00:41:22,458
but it's gonna happen, because
I'm gonna make it happen.

1068
00:41:22,510 --> 00:41:25,294
One day, you're gonna walk
into your office,

1069
00:41:25,346 --> 00:41:27,162
and she's gonna be gone.

1070
