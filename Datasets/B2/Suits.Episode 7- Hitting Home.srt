<i>You walked out of our session
because you didn't wants...</i>

00:00:09,094 --> 00:00:10,837
- To talk about your mother.
- You're insane.

3
00:00:10,838 --> 00:00:12,674
And you're a self-serving
narcissist

4
00:00:12,675 --> 00:00:14,677
Who will do or say anything
to get what he wants.

5
00:00:15,014 --> 00:00:18,127
It's my sister's company.
I'll give you her business.

6
00:00:18,163 --> 00:00:19,779
All you have to do
is handle her divorce.

7
00:00:19,816 --> 00:00:20,927
All right, I'll do it.

8
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:22,318
Promise me you won't
sleep with Esther.

9
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:25,015
The last thing I want to do
is sleep with your sister.

10
00:00:25,069 --> 00:00:27,364
Would you like to
take me home tonight?

11
00:00:27,401 --> 00:00:28,929
I would.

12
00:00:28,966 --> 00:00:31,051
Jack Soloff signed
Fletcher as a client

13
00:00:31,089 --> 00:00:32,409
and now I have to let
McKernon go.

14
00:00:32,445 --> 00:00:34,182
I'm sorry you're in
this position right now.

15
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:35,853
I'm not the one
who put you in it.

16
00:00:35,889 --> 00:00:37,592
Jack Soloff is.

17
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:39,958
This is your last chance
to work with me.

18
00:00:39,995 --> 00:00:42,150
Take it and you have a future,

19
00:00:42,187 --> 00:00:45,491
don't and you can go
ask Daniel Hardman for a job.

20
00:00:45,527 --> 00:00:47,438
I'm ready to talk about
my mother.

23
00:01:08,628 --> 00:01:10,575
Mom?

24
00:01:14,474 --> 00:01:17,847
- Mom?
- Harvey.

25
00:01:17,883 --> 00:01:19,724
What are you...
What are you doing here?

26
00:01:19,727 --> 00:01:21,221
I got sent home from school.

27
00:01:21,258 --> 00:01:22,960
I threw up.

28
00:01:22,998 --> 00:01:24,387
Oh, well, let's get you to bed.

29
00:01:24,424 --> 00:01:26,510
Hey, Lil, I was thinking that...

30
00:01:26,546 --> 00:01:28,615
- Who's that?
- Honey, you remember

31
00:01:28,651 --> 00:01:31,275
our cousin...
My cousin Scott?

32
00:01:31,312 --> 00:01:33,120
- Hey.
- No.

33
00:01:33,157 --> 00:01:35,591
Course you do.
He's cousin Judy's brother.

34
00:01:35,627 --> 00:01:37,295
I don't feel good.

35
00:01:37,332 --> 00:01:39,278
Oh, yeah, you're burning up.

36
00:01:39,315 --> 00:01:41,575
Let's get you to bed.

37
00:01:41,611 --> 00:01:44,045
And let's not tell Dad
about cousin Scott.

38
00:01:44,081 --> 00:01:46,619
Okay? 'Cause they don't
get along.

39
00:01:48,593 --> 00:01:50,417
Come on.

40
00:01:50,455 --> 00:01:52,401
You poor thing.

41
00:01:53,672 --> 00:01:57,428
"You poor thing."
That's what stuck with me.

42
00:01:57,465 --> 00:01:58,941
She said "You poor thing,"

43
00:01:58,995 --> 00:02:00,959
but she didn't give a shit
about me.

44
00:02:00,996 --> 00:02:02,629
And did you know what you saw?

45
00:02:04,615 --> 00:02:07,814
No, I just knew
something was wrong.

46
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:09,483
And you didn't tell your father?

47
00:02:09,521 --> 00:02:11,675
She told me not to.

48
00:02:11,712 --> 00:02:13,241
And you trusted her?

49
00:02:13,277 --> 00:02:15,015
I did.

50
00:02:15,052 --> 00:02:17,155
Harvey, I never thought
I'd be saying this to you,

51
00:02:17,209 --> 00:02:19,016
but I'm proud.

52
00:02:19,053 --> 00:02:21,069
It took an amazing amount
of courage to tell me that.

53
00:02:21,106 --> 00:02:23,387
- We're not gonna hug, are we?
- [chuckles] No, we're not.

54
00:02:23,402 --> 00:02:24,896
But it does feel good
to end a session

55
00:02:24,933 --> 00:02:26,392

56
00:02:33,213 --> 00:02:34,986

57
00:02:35,022 --> 00:02:37,039
I remember when I used to
handle that asshole.

58
00:02:37,041 --> 00:02:40,448
Funny, I don't remember
inviting you into my office.

59
00:02:40,485 --> 00:02:42,222
Oh, yeah, that's right,
it must be because

60
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:43,648
it's something
that I would never do.

61
00:02:43,686 --> 00:02:46,988
Listen, Mike, I know I pulled
some shit with you and Louis,

62
00:02:47,026 --> 00:02:48,520
but I'm here to
make things right with you.

63
00:02:48,556 --> 00:02:50,485
Not interested.

64
00:02:50,522 --> 00:02:52,538
Just hear me out.

65
00:02:55,741 --> 00:02:56,939
What the hell is this?

66
00:02:56,976 --> 00:02:58,783
It's a case that's
tailor-made for someone

67
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:01,810
with a hedge fund background.

68
00:03:01,847 --> 00:03:03,341
New York Teacher's Pension Fund

69
00:03:03,378 --> 00:03:05,603
just lost 30% of their
annual income.

70
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:08,594
They put half their portfolio
in derivatives without hedging?

71
00:03:08,632 --> 00:03:10,334
Not just derivatives.
Derivatives created

72
00:03:10,371 --> 00:03:12,300
and marketed by Straussbank

73
00:03:12,354 --> 00:03:14,474
to increase their own revenue.

74
00:03:14,511 --> 00:03:15,970

Sorry, Jack,
I don't work with people

76
00:03:17,573 --> 00:03:18,927
that I don't trust
and I don't trust somebody

77
00:03:18,964 --> 00:03:20,111

00:03:20,147 --> 00:03:21,745
to make things right
without a good reason.

79
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,033
You want the reason?
Jessica told me to.

80
00:03:24,034 --> 00:03:25,040
Yeah, well, she didn't tell me.

81
00:03:25,078 --> 00:03:26,885
And until she does...

82
00:03:26,939 --> 00:03:28,780
you can get out of my office.

83
00:03:37,184 --> 00:03:38,957
The Simon brief is on your desk

84
00:03:38,994 --> 00:03:41,149
and I moved your Wednesday
noon meeting to five.

85
00:03:41,186 --> 00:03:42,332
Why'd you do that?

86
00:03:42,369 --> 00:03:43,870
Because Anthony Kimball's
most honest

87
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:44,837
with a drink in him.

88
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:46,281
And on top of that,

89
00:03:46,318 --> 00:03:47,672
I wouldn't want you
to have to work too hard

90
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:50,612
- on your birthday.
- What? It's not my birthday.

91
00:03:50,649 --> 00:03:51,900
Oh, come on, you can tell me.

92
00:03:51,954 --> 00:03:53,917
What is it? 48? 49?

93
00:03:53,954 --> 00:03:57,171
- The big 6-0?
- A: I'm not the one pushing 60.

94
00:03:57,225 --> 00:03:58,649
You better not be talking to me.

95
00:03:58,704 --> 00:04:01,363
B: If it were,
I'd be drinking with someone

96
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,241
a lot prettier
than Anthony Kimball.

97
00:04:03,278 --> 00:04:05,782
Then why is Wednesday night
permanently blocked out

98
00:04:05,784 --> 00:04:07,347
on your calendar?

99
00:04:13,641 --> 00:04:15,308
- Donna.
- Harvey.

100
00:04:15,346 --> 00:04:17,918
- You look busy.
- I look busy because I am busy.

101
00:04:22,078 --> 00:04:24,563
Too busy to join me
at Del Posto on Wednesday night?

102
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:28,877
Harvey, we don't need
to do that anymore.

103
00:04:28,915 --> 00:04:30,148
Then why did you leave it

104
00:04:30,185 --> 00:04:31,770
permanently blocked off
on my calendar?

105
00:04:31,802 --> 00:04:33,178
Because I did that
a long time ago

106
00:04:33,194 --> 00:04:35,453
and when I left your desk
I forgot to undo it.

107
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:37,227
Then why don't we pretend
that you forgot

108
00:04:37,265 --> 00:04:38,689
to undo it on purpose?

109
00:04:38,725 --> 00:04:40,358
I don't work for you anymore.

110
00:04:40,396 --> 00:04:41,750
What would we be celebrating?

111
00:04:41,787 --> 00:04:44,481

the day you came to my desk,

112
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:46,656
how about we celebrate...

113
00:04:46,693 --> 00:04:48,326
two weeks of being
on decent terms?

114
00:04:48,363 --> 00:04:50,309
It's only been
a week and a half.

115
00:04:50,346 --> 00:04:52,988
Seriously, Donna?

116
00:04:53,025 --> 00:04:55,493
I don't just want to be
on decent terms.

117
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:57,059
I want to get back
to being friends.

118

00:07:14,318 --> 00:07:17,256
Because I told them
when I signed Fletcher.

176
00:07:17,258 --> 00:07:19,238
Which I wouldn't have done
if I'd known

177
00:07:19,276 --> 00:07:20,387
you were gonna drop them

178
00:07:20,424 --> 00:07:22,057
because it made me
look like shit.

179
00:07:22,094 --> 00:07:24,597
Well, it didn't make me come
out smelling like a rose either.

180
00:07:24,617 --> 00:07:26,545
And your mentor
seems to have known that.

181
00:07:26,582 --> 00:07:27,763
He's not my mentor.

182
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,102
I went to him for advice,

183
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:31,138
and all it got me
was almost getting fired.

184
00:07:31,174 --> 00:07:33,330
But you said you'd
give me one more chance,

185
00:07:33,384 --> 00:07:34,930
and I've been trying to take it.

186
00:07:34,967 --> 00:07:36,896
Give me one good example
of that.

187
00:07:36,932 --> 00:07:38,897
I approached Mike Ross
to work with me this morning.

188
00:07:38,933 --> 00:07:41,401
And by the way,
he spat in my face.

189
00:07:41,438 --> 00:07:42,515
[sighs]

190
00:07:44,013 --> 00:07:46,063
Jessica...

191
00:07:46,101 --> 00:07:48,934
you made your point
and I heard you.

192
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:51,212
If you're just gonna
fire me anyway,

193
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:53,822
why give me the chance
in the first place?

194
00:07:55,633 --> 00:07:58,484
A joke?
Uh, do you hear me laughing?

195
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:01,232
10% is 11% more
than you deserve.

196
00:08:01,269 --> 00:08:02,206
I...

197
00:08:02,244 --> 00:08:03,877
What the hell?

198
00:08:03,913 --> 00:08:04,851
This better be important.

199
00:08:04,905 --> 00:08:06,103
I was just about
to close a deal.

200
00:08:06,141 --> 00:08:07,461
I just heard a rumor

201
00:08:07,497 --> 00:08:09,652
that Jack Soloff
signed Fletcher Engines.

202
00:08:09,654 --> 00:08:11,740
That's ridiculous... everyone
knows we can't sign Fletcher

203
00:08:11,776 --> 00:08:13,027
if we represent McKernon.

204
00:08:13,064 --> 00:08:14,801
I'll tell you what
everyone knows, Louis.

205
00:08:14,838 --> 00:08:16,332
Jack signed Fletcher.

206
00:08:16,369 --> 00:08:18,107
Jessica forced him to drop them,

207
00:08:18,143 --> 00:08:20,020
and the only reason Jack
would have done that

208
00:08:20,057 --> 00:08:23,500
in the first place is if
you were fired by McKernon.

209
00:08:23,536 --> 00:08:24,856
Harvey, I can explain.

210
00:08:24,893 --> 00:08:26,283
God damn it.
I knew it.

211
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:28,927
Just wait a minute.
Harvey, listen to me.

212
00:08:28,963 --> 00:08:30,353
Jack set us up.

213
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:31,884
He acted as if he was
cooperating

214
00:08:31,938 --> 00:08:33,902
when all along he was looking
to blow up the deal.

215
00:08:33,939 --> 00:08:35,224
Why the hell didn't you
come to me when it happened?

216
00:08:35,261 --> 00:08:36,754
Because we wanted
to fix it ourselves.

217
00:08:36,792 --> 00:08:38,425
Wanting to fix it yourself

218
00:08:38,461 --> 00:08:39,990
is the cause of every problem
you and I have ever had,

219
00:08:40,045 --> 00:08:41,347
and now you're teaching
that bullshit to Mike?

220
00:08:41,384 --> 00:08:43,331
You know what, Mike and I
worked on that deal together,

221
00:08:43,367 --> 00:08:44,826
and we kicked ass.

222
00:08:44,864 --> 00:08:47,228
I'm happy, Mike's happy,
Dominic's happy,

223
00:08:47,264 --> 00:08:48,602
and I'll tell you why.

224
00:08:48,656 --> 00:08:50,700
Because I'm a damn good
attorney, and you know it.

225
00:08:50,708 --> 00:08:52,515
So if that's the only thing
you came in here for,

226
00:08:52,553 --> 00:08:54,708
I would like to close
my deal now.

227
00:09:01,551 --> 00:09:03,915
Mr. Specter,
Esther Litt just called.

228
00:09:03,969 --> 00:09:06,419
She has an urgent matter.
Needs to see you right away.

229
00:09:06,457 --> 00:09:08,107
Did she say what it was about?

230
00:09:08,161 --> 00:09:10,351
No. Just not to tell
her brother.

231
00:09:16,023 --> 00:09:19,605
Oh, so this is where the little
people get their caffeine.

232
00:09:19,643 --> 00:09:22,945
I'm guessing you're not here
to have a breakfast bar.

233
00:09:22,982 --> 00:09:25,138
I've never had a breakfast bar
in my life.

234
00:09:25,192 --> 00:09:28,164
I want to thank you
for taking on that pension case

235
00:09:28,166 --> 00:09:29,974
- with Jack Soloff.
- I didn't take on

236
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:31,330
the pension case
with Jack Soloff.

237
00:09:31,367 --> 00:09:33,278
- Yes, you did.
- Jessica, no.

238
00:09:33,316 --> 00:09:34,600
You can't make me work
with that man.

239
00:09:34,638 --> 00:09:36,166
I can make you work

240
00:09:36,203 --> 00:09:38,184
with the goddamn window
washers if I want to.

241
00:09:38,221 --> 00:09:40,654
And if you don't do this,
you might find yourself

242
00:09:40,691 --> 00:09:44,134
dangling 50 stories
above the ground.

243
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:45,873
- Why?
- Because I asked Jack

244
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:47,300
to make peace,
and you're the one

245
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:49,839
he chose to reach out to,
so you're the one to do this.

246
00:09:49,876 --> 00:09:51,927
I guess I meant
why don't you just fire him?

247
00:09:51,963 --> 00:09:53,910
If I fired every
ambitious attorney

248
00:09:53,912 --> 00:09:55,337
that ever took me on,

249
00:09:55,373 --> 00:09:58,989
there'd be nobody left here
but me and Harold Gunderson.

250
00:09:59,043 --> 00:10:01,181
Wait a second... you know
who Harold Gunderson is?

251
00:10:01,183 --> 00:10:03,130
I know who everybody is.

252
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:04,626
And before you say
one more word,

253
00:10:04,663 --> 00:10:07,618
if I ever start handing out
pink slips for troublemakers,

254
00:10:07,672 --> 00:10:09,984
you'd be the first in line.

Did Jeffrey get greedy again?

No. A man named
Kenneth Jackson

my nut-free muffins

00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:29,889
What happened?
Too much gluten?

265
00:10:29,926 --> 00:10:31,350
- Not enough gluten?
- Harvey,

266
00:10:31,387 --> 00:10:33,820
this isn't funny.
This is my company,

267
00:10:33,858 --> 00:10:36,813
and my entire brand
is based on quality.

268
00:10:36,849 --> 00:10:38,552
I'm sorry.
I'll take it seriously.

Don't thank me.
Thank Louis.

handle this case.

What?

273
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:47,877
This is a business matter,
not personal.

And I'm not stealing
Louis's client.

275

You're not stealing me.
You already handled my divorce.

276
00:10:52,541 --> 00:10:55,566
Are you gonna tell me that Louis
is a better lawyer than you?

277
00:10:55,602 --> 00:10:57,688
No. I'm gonna tell you
that he's a damn good lawyer,

278
00:10:57,724 --> 00:10:59,236
and he'd do anything
to project you.

279
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:00,471
That's not the point.

280
00:11:00,508 --> 00:11:02,662
I need this to go away quietly,

281
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:05,000
and Louis doesn't do
anything quietly.

282
00:11:05,001 --> 00:11:07,225
- Then tell him that.
- He never listens to me.

283
00:11:07,263 --> 00:11:09,434
Then get him to listen
or get another law firm,

284
00:11:09,489 --> 00:11:11,923
because I'm not
taking this case.

285
00:11:11,959 --> 00:11:14,983
Harvey, I don't need
another firm.

286

I need you.

00:11:16,899 --> 00:11:18,637
You know what I think?

288
00:11:18,674 --> 00:11:20,725
I think you want to go
out with me again,

289
00:11:20,762 --> 00:11:22,116
and you came to me with this

290
00:11:22,154 --> 00:11:23,421
because you're afraid
to say it to me.

I don't believe you!

292
00:11:24,763 --> 00:11:27,683
You think I concocted
a lawsuit against my own company

293
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,510
just to tell a man
I've already been with

294

that I like him?

295
00:11:31,982 --> 00:11:33,162
Sure looks that way.

296
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,677
In that case,

00:11:34,679 --> 00:11:38,329

you settle, you look guilty.

349
00:13:34,669 --> 00:13:36,998
This is a shakedown,
pure and simple.

350
00:13:37,034 --> 00:13:38,581
I know that, but I don't care.

351
00:13:38,618 --> 00:13:40,059
This is a business decision.

And that's why I'm trying
to stop others

I'm telling you,

354
00:13:43,228 --> 00:13:44,513
- I know what I'm doing.
- I didn't say you don't.

355
00:13:44,515 --> 00:13:45,957
No, you're just telling me
how to do my job.

356
00:13:46,011 --> 00:13:48,653
Louis, I came to you
because you're my brother,

357
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:52,376
and I am telling you,
this is what I need.

358
00:13:52,413 --> 00:13:55,455
All right, we'll settle.

359
00:13:55,509 --> 00:13:57,456
Thank you, Louis.

00:13:57,510 --> 00:13:59,161
No, thank you.

361
00:13:59,215 --> 00:14:00,830
For what?

362
00:14:00,832 --> 00:14:02,987
For not going to Harvey.

363
00:14:05,285 --> 00:14:07,475
Once he handled your divorce,

364
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:09,877
I would have thought you'd want
him to handle everything.

I just stopped by

00:14:21,847 --> 00:14:24,141
to eat my morning bagel
and ask why Jack Soloff

371
00:14:24,177 --> 00:14:27,272
tried to sign Fletcher Engines
and you didn't tell me.

372
00:14:27,309 --> 00:14:28,977
I didn't tell you because
I was busy fixing it.

373
00:14:29,013 --> 00:14:30,752
And did fixing it
involve figuring out

374
00:14:30,788 --> 00:14:32,317
that he went to Daniel Hardman?

As a matter of fact, it did.

376
00:14:35,659 --> 00:14:37,501
You saw Hardman.

377
00:14:37,538 --> 00:14:39,589
I did, and it didn't take long,

378
00:14:39,643 --> 00:14:40,945

Yep.
He said he was

382
00:14:45,122 --> 00:14:46,581
just giving Jack
some helpful advice.

383
00:14:46,618 --> 00:14:48,018
Well, I think it's time
we gave Jack

00:14:48,045 --> 00:14:49,712
some helpful advice of our own,

He says he's done
confiding in Hardman,

388
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:59,211
and I've decided to consider
the matter closed.

389
00:14:59,248 --> 00:15:01,264
You telling me you trust
that clown?

390
00:15:01,301 --> 00:15:03,038
Now, I may look
damn good for my age,

391

You want to know how deep
it goes with him and Hardman,

00:15:07,285 --> 00:15:08,848
- don't you?
- I sure as hell do.

394
00:15:08,884 --> 00:15:10,866
Which is why I asked Mike

This doesn't look like

398
00:15:18,496 --> 00:15:20,130
a "forgive me
for being a dick" card.

399
00:15:20,132 --> 00:15:22,408
It's not.
It's a 28-page interrogatory

400
00:15:22,462 --> 00:15:23,957
for Straussbank.

401
00:15:23,993 --> 00:15:25,870
Thanks.

402
00:15:25,908 --> 00:15:27,018
What are you doing?

403
00:15:27,056 --> 00:15:28,599
You told me you don't

00:15:28,621 --> 00:15:30,149
you don't trust.

405
00:15:30,203 --> 00:15:31,060
Neither do I.

406
00:15:31,061 --> 00:15:32,711
You don't have to trust me
to understand

407
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:34,259
that the shady shit
at Straussbank

408
00:15:34,296 --> 00:15:36,034
starts at the top.

409
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:37,390
All the way to the top?

410
00:15:37,427 --> 00:15:39,548
There's a 50-50 chance
that the CEO knows.

411
00:15:39,584 --> 00:15:41,217
The CFO had to know.

412
00:15:41,255 --> 00:15:42,888
All we have to do
is get their emails.

413
00:15:42,924 --> 00:15:44,470
That's easy.
We agree not to pursue

414
00:15:44,525 --> 00:15:47,167
criminal charges, they'll
hand emails over right now.

415
00:15:47,203 --> 00:15:48,767
We can't give up the threat
of going to prison.

416
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:50,473
That's what gives us leverage.
We have to go to court.

417
00:15:50,509 --> 00:15:52,247
Going to court
will take forever.

418
00:15:52,301 --> 00:15:53,968
I just went through
the same thing with Robert Zane.

Why don't you pick up the phone

420
00:15:55,553 --> 00:15:57,709
and ask him
who turned out to be right?

421
00:15:57,746 --> 00:15:59,135
You know,
I heard you were cocky,

422
00:15:59,173 --> 00:16:00,770
but I had no idea.

423
00:16:00,808 --> 00:16:03,658
You're the one who came
to me looking to make peace.

424
00:16:03,695 --> 00:16:06,894
You wanna make peace or not?

425
00:16:11,262 --> 00:16:13,852
All right.
We'll try it your way.

Rachel, what can I do for you?

427
00:16:19,769 --> 00:16:21,541
I heard about Esther,

428
00:16:21,578 --> 00:16:23,385
and I was hoping I could help.

429
00:16:23,422 --> 00:16:24,638
I appreciate the offer,

430
00:16:24,674 --> 00:16:26,354
but I'm gonna take care
of this one myself.

431
00:16:26,379 --> 00:16:27,619
And I'm not trying to interfere.

432
00:16:27,631 --> 00:16:29,334
I just thought it would
be nice to learn

433
00:16:29,372 --> 00:16:31,353
from the most talented,
diligent,

434
00:16:31,389 --> 00:16:33,022
and respected partner
that we have here.

435
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:34,276
Yeah, you're just trying
to butter me up.

436
00:16:34,312 --> 00:16:35,614
Is it working?

437
00:16:35,652 --> 00:16:37,720
Handsome.

438
00:16:37,756 --> 00:16:39,337
Listen to me.

439
00:16:39,374 --> 00:16:41,424
She's my sister.

440
00:16:41,478 --> 00:16:43,703
She's being sued.

441
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:45,583
Last time she had a problem,
she went to Harvey,

442
00:16:45,619 --> 00:16:46,661
but this time
she's coming to me,

443
00:16:46,697 --> 00:16:47,949
and I'm not gonna farm
any of it out.

444
00:16:47,985 --> 00:16:49,061
Can you understand that?

445
00:16:49,099 --> 00:16:50,488
The reason I want on this case

446
00:16:50,525 --> 00:16:52,019
is that I admire Esther
and her company,

447
00:16:52,056 --> 00:16:54,280
and if someone's coming at her
with a frivolous lawsuit,

448
00:16:54,317 --> 00:16:57,411
then... I don't care
how little I do.

449
00:16:57,449 --> 00:16:59,430
I just want to help you.

450
00:17:04,372 --> 00:17:05,727
Paperwork's right here.

451
00:17:09,277 --> 00:17:10,754
(Jack)
Your Honor, as you can see,

452
00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:12,334
there's been clear negligence
at best,

453
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:14,112
- deliberate deception at worst.
- Not to mention

454
00:17:14,149 --> 00:17:15,632
a breach of fiduciary duty.

455
00:17:15,633 --> 00:17:17,092
I'm inclined to agree.

456
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:18,484
Your honor, the only
thing that's clear

457
00:17:18,521 --> 00:17:20,085
is his clients chose
a risky investment.

458
00:17:20,121 --> 00:17:21,859
That's not deception
on our part.

459
00:17:21,896 --> 00:17:23,911
The deception is he created
those derivatives,

460
00:17:23,949 --> 00:17:26,173
he knew how risky they were,
and he sold them to us anyway.

461
00:17:26,209 --> 00:17:27,982
I have $2 billion
in investment funds.

462
00:17:28,019 --> 00:17:29,721
You think I review
every investment?

463
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:31,566
I don't know, but you sure
as hell reviewed this one.

464
00:17:31,568 --> 00:17:33,932
- And where's your proof?
- We don't have any... yet.

465
00:17:33,968 --> 00:17:36,137
Which is why we're requesting
access to these emails.

466
00:17:36,143 --> 00:17:37,724
This isn't about
getting their emails.

467
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,010
This is about determining
if trial's moving forward.

468
00:17:40,011 --> 00:17:41,227
And it is.

469
00:17:41,281 --> 00:17:42,945
I'll set the email
discovery hearing

470
00:17:42,946 --> 00:17:44,387
- for three weeks.
- Three weeks?

471
00:17:44,425 --> 00:17:45,727
Uh, your Honor,

472
00:17:45,729 --> 00:17:46,945
my wife has surgery
in three weeks.

473
00:17:46,947 --> 00:17:48,336
I'd like to request
an additional month.

474
00:17:48,338 --> 00:17:50,737
Bullshit she has surgery.

475
00:17:50,773 --> 00:17:52,390
Scheduled C-section
at Columbia Presbyterian.

476
00:17:52,426 --> 00:17:54,337
Then put someone else
on the case.

477
00:17:54,392 --> 00:17:56,513
- That's not how it works.
- If I may...

478
00:17:56,515 --> 00:17:59,434
If we agree not to pursue
criminal charges in this matter,

479
00:17:59,472 --> 00:18:02,253
will you give us the emails
within the week?

480
00:18:02,255 --> 00:18:03,784
You agree to that right here,

481
00:18:03,821 --> 00:18:05,523
I'll give 'em to you tomorrow.

482
00:18:05,524 --> 00:18:07,288
Then we have a deal.

483
00:18:12,302 --> 00:18:14,471
Wanna tell me what kind of
kickback you're getting?

484
00:18:15,035 --> 00:18:17,242
- Excuse me?
- You went behind my back.

485
00:18:17,314 --> 00:18:18,582
I didn't do anything
behind your back.

486
00:18:18,618 --> 00:18:19,360
I did it in front of your face.

487
00:18:19,361 --> 00:18:21,336
You know what I mean...
You gave up on leverage

488
00:18:21,337 --> 00:18:23,175
by handing him a get out
of jail free card,

489
00:18:23,176 --> 00:18:24,600
which means you're either
in their pocket

490
00:18:24,637 --> 00:18:25,853
or you're using this case

491
00:18:25,889 --> 00:18:27,035
so you can sign them
once it's over.

492
00:18:27,073 --> 00:18:28,740
- What did you just say to me?
- You heard me.

493
00:18:28,777 --> 00:18:31,506
You shook that guy's hand like
you were his goddamn cousin.

494
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,716
You listen to me.
If they wanted to be my client,

495
00:18:33,752 --> 00:18:35,699
I'd take them.
But I didn't do that

496
00:18:35,735 --> 00:18:36,673
to kiss his ass.

497
00:18:36,709 --> 00:18:38,029
I did it to get what we needed.

498
00:18:38,032 --> 00:18:39,387
We already had what we needed.

499
00:18:39,424 --> 00:18:40,535
No, we didn't.

500
00:18:40,572 --> 00:18:42,274
We had a hearing on it
in seven weeks,

501
00:18:42,311 --> 00:18:44,772
and that C-section bullshit
was just the tip of the iceberg.

502
00:18:44,781 --> 00:18:46,693
Between now and then,
they'd have figured out a way

503
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:47,980
to put it off
for another two years.

504
00:18:48,018 --> 00:18:49,476
- You don't know that.
- Yes, I do.

505
00:18:49,513 --> 00:18:53,094
I said I would try it your way,
and it didn't work.

506
00:18:53,131 --> 00:18:55,530
Well, now those emails
are coming.

507
00:18:55,567 --> 00:18:58,714
Are you gonna help me or not?

508
00:19:04,961 --> 00:19:07,064
Louis, I need to talk
to you... we have a problem.

509
00:19:07,118 --> 00:19:08,560
- What's wrong?
- What's wrong

510
00:19:08,614 --> 00:19:09,690
is Kenneth Jackson's lawyer.

511
00:19:09,692 --> 00:19:11,047
Her name's Lisbeth Wexler,

512
00:19:11,084 --> 00:19:12,509
and this isn't her first
frivolous suit.

513
00:19:12,545 --> 00:19:14,005
Well, it never is
with these people.

514
00:19:14,006 --> 00:19:15,187
That doesn't mean
we can't settle.

515
00:19:15,224 --> 00:19:16,440
Okay.
You don't understand.

516
00:19:16,477 --> 00:19:17,796
I went through dozens
of her cases.

517
00:19:17,834 --> 00:19:19,014
Every time she gets an offer,

518
00:19:19,016 --> 00:19:20,580
she threatens
to go public with it.

519
00:19:20,617 --> 00:19:22,041
- Shit.
- What?

520
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:23,355
That's exactly
what I was afraid of.

521
00:19:23,356 --> 00:19:24,641
Okay, well, then you know
it's not a big deal.

522
00:19:24,678 --> 00:19:26,902
We can handle it, but we
can't give them an offer.

523
00:19:26,939 --> 00:19:28,085
No, you don't understand.

524
00:19:28,122 --> 00:19:29,790
I tried to tell Esther
this might happen,

525
00:19:29,792 --> 00:19:31,077
but then she made me promise

526
00:19:31,114 --> 00:19:32,956
that I would make this thing
go away without any trouble.

527
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:34,452
Okay, well, if we don't do
something other than settle,

528
00:19:34,454 --> 00:19:37,844
she's in for a hell
of a lot more trouble.

529
00:19:42,943 --> 00:19:44,263
(Harvey)
He didn't really say that.

530
00:19:44,301 --> 00:19:47,081
Oh, not only did he say it,
but I had to transcribe it

531
00:19:47,118 --> 00:19:49,343
word for word
off his Dictaphone.

532
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:50,700
[laughs]

533
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:55,362
- What?
- No, I just realized

534
00:19:55,398 --> 00:19:56,718
I haven't thought about
Jack Soloff

535
00:19:56,756 --> 00:19:58,945
and his bullshit for two hours.

536
00:19:58,982 --> 00:20:00,546
Glad we did this, Harvey.

537
00:20:00,582 --> 00:20:02,529
Me, too.
We should do it more often.

538
00:20:02,566 --> 00:20:05,521
Well, I'm not sure how Mitchell
would feel about that.

539
00:20:05,558 --> 00:20:06,704
Who's Mitchell?

540
00:20:06,741 --> 00:20:07,869
He's the man
that I've been seeing

541
00:20:07,906 --> 00:20:09,870
for the last six weeks.

542
00:20:09,924 --> 00:20:11,853
He's...

543
00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:15,193
he's smart and he's funny and...

544
00:20:15,195 --> 00:20:18,185
best of all, he has nothing
to do with the practice of law.

545
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,273
I'm happy for you, Donna.

546
00:20:20,327 --> 00:20:22,708
Thanks.

547
00:20:22,762 --> 00:20:25,318
And the reason I told you

548
00:20:25,372 --> 00:20:27,579
is so that you'll know
that I'm not jealous

549
00:20:27,633 --> 00:20:30,883
when I say...

550
00:20:30,939 --> 00:20:31,716
you need to tell Louis

551
00:20:31,717 --> 00:20:33,575
you've been
sleeping with Esther.

552
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:35,315
- What?
- Oh, please.

553
00:20:35,369 --> 00:20:37,061
It took me all of two seconds
to put it together

554
00:20:37,062 --> 00:20:39,322
after I saw you two mooning over
each other this morning.

555
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:40,765
It's not what you think.

556
00:20:40,802 --> 00:20:42,853
We bonded together
during her divorce proceedings.

557
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:45,462
Harvey, you said
you wanted to be friends.

558
00:20:45,498 --> 00:20:46,940
This is me being your friend.

559
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:50,045
Friends don't accuse
each other of things.

560
00:20:50,081 --> 00:20:51,667
I'm not accusing you.
I'm looking out for you.

561
00:20:51,668 --> 00:20:52,884
How is that looking out for me?

562
00:20:52,887 --> 00:20:54,451
Because, like I said,
you need to tell him.

563
00:20:54,505 --> 00:20:56,538
Well, you know what?
I don't need to do that

564
00:20:56,593 --> 00:20:59,147
because, for once,
your radar is off.

565
00:20:59,201 --> 00:21:00,578
We haven't been
sleeping together.

566
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:01,720
We slept together one time.

567
00:21:01,723 --> 00:21:02,346
What difference does that make?

568
00:21:02,347 --> 00:21:04,083
You promised him
you wouldn't do it at all.

569
00:21:04,085 --> 00:21:07,475
Donna, Louis isn't rational
on his best days

570
00:21:07,529 --> 00:21:09,702
with issues that don't
involve his sister,

571
00:21:09,739 --> 00:21:11,790
Now, how is he going to take it
if I do what you're asking?

572
00:21:11,826 --> 00:21:13,007
And how do you think
he's gonna react

573
00:21:13,044 --> 00:21:14,346
when he finds out
you kept this from him?

574
00:21:14,401 --> 00:21:17,043
- He's not gonna find out.
- Yes, he is.

575
00:21:17,097 --> 00:21:18,932
Because I didn't have
to be me to see the way

576
00:21:18,959 --> 00:21:20,575
you two looked at each other.

577
00:21:20,611 --> 00:21:23,515
And someday Louis is gonna
see that, too.

578
00:21:23,516 --> 00:21:26,940
Donna, I appreciate you
telling me this as a friend.

579
00:21:26,996 --> 00:21:29,985
Now, as a friend,
I'm telling you

580
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:32,125
to mind your own business.

581
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:42,394
I was right.
You cut them some side deal.

582
00:21:42,431 --> 00:21:44,308
What the hell
are you talking about?

583
00:21:44,362 --> 00:21:45,508
I went through all their emails

584
00:21:45,545 --> 00:21:48,430
and I found them nothing
tying them to anything.

585
00:21:48,467 --> 00:21:50,448
Which means you knew
they would leave some emails out

586
00:21:50,485 --> 00:21:52,014
and you let it go
to get something out of it.

587
00:21:52,050 --> 00:21:53,683
I didn't know they would
leave anything out,

588
00:21:53,721 --> 00:21:54,901
but I thought they might

589
00:21:54,939 --> 00:21:56,524
and I am gonna get
something out of it,

590
00:21:56,538 --> 00:21:57,664
but it's not what you think.

591
00:21:57,687 --> 00:21:59,476
- What are you talking about?
- Your idea

592
00:21:59,513 --> 00:22:01,059
of threatening prison was right,

593
00:22:01,096 --> 00:22:02,799
but nobody ever went to jail

594
00:22:02,836 --> 00:22:05,582
for selling shitty securities.

595
00:22:05,619 --> 00:22:07,252
They go to jail
for destroying evidence.

596
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:09,774
So, instead of proving
to some jury

597
00:22:09,812 --> 00:22:11,741
that doesn't understand
securities law

598
00:22:11,777 --> 00:22:15,115
that these guys knew the risks
of their investments...

599
00:22:15,117 --> 00:22:17,244
All we have to do is prove
they deleted some emails.

600
00:22:18,771 --> 00:22:21,326
[scoffs]

601
00:22:21,363 --> 00:22:24,266
I'm sorry.

602
00:22:24,302 --> 00:22:26,284
Take a seat.

603
00:22:28,512 --> 00:22:30,615
You know that's
the second time in two days

604
00:22:30,669 --> 00:22:32,546
that you jumped right to me
being the bad guy?

605
00:22:32,583 --> 00:22:34,251
Well, you have to admit,
my experience

606
00:22:34,287 --> 00:22:35,399
with how
you treated me and Louis

607
00:22:35,436 --> 00:22:37,765
was you being the bad guy.

608
00:22:37,801 --> 00:22:39,435
Fair enough.

609
00:22:39,472 --> 00:22:41,592
But were you there
when Louis lied to my face

610
00:22:41,629 --> 00:22:43,470
about backing me in a meeting?

611
00:22:43,507 --> 00:22:45,019
Or when he told Jessica

612
00:22:45,073 --> 00:22:48,272
that I did something awful
that he, in fact, did?

613
00:22:48,309 --> 00:22:49,699
No, I wasn't.

614
00:22:49,735 --> 00:22:51,577
But you do know him

615
00:22:51,614 --> 00:22:53,317
and what he's capable of.

616
00:22:53,353 --> 00:22:55,543
And you're somehow
on good terms with him.

617
00:22:55,581 --> 00:22:56,691
I'm on good terms with him

618
00:22:56,729 --> 00:22:58,258
because I've seen
other sides of him.

619
00:22:58,312 --> 00:22:59,962
Well, I have other sides, too.

620
00:22:59,999 --> 00:23:03,372
I may have done
some office backstabbing,

621
00:23:03,374 --> 00:23:06,068
but I have never done
anything to indicate to you

622
00:23:06,105 --> 00:23:07,547
that I would
do something illegal.

623
00:23:07,549 --> 00:23:11,530
Which is what you
came in here accusing me of.

624
00:23:11,584 --> 00:23:14,157
Okay, Jack.

625
00:23:14,194 --> 00:23:16,088
You can have a chance
to show me another side

626
00:23:16,142 --> 00:23:17,671
of yourself, too.

627
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:25,243
I told you to settle this thing!

628
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,426
And I'm trying to.

629
00:23:26,462 --> 00:23:28,652
Then why did I just
get a notice that the FDA

630
00:23:28,689 --> 00:23:30,114
is investigating my company?

631
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:32,862
- What?
- What did you do?

632
00:23:36,152 --> 00:23:38,359
I was gonna settle,
but then Rachel found out

633
00:23:38,396 --> 00:23:39,722
their lawyer has history
of blackmailing companies

634
00:23:39,723 --> 00:23:41,370
so our only option
was to counter-sue.

635
00:23:41,371 --> 00:23:45,266
You filed a counter-suit against
my explicit instructions?

636
00:23:45,319 --> 00:23:47,613
You know what, Esther?
You came to me for help,

637
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:49,179
and I don't tell you
how to bake your muffins.

638
00:23:49,216 --> 00:23:51,267
Because you don't know the
first thing about my business.

639
00:23:51,303 --> 00:23:52,624
And you don't know
the first thing about mine.

640
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:54,467
I don't have to.
I know you.

641
00:23:54,505 --> 00:23:56,277
And you've got a chip
on your shoulder

642
00:23:56,314 --> 00:23:58,608
the size of Montana
and when it comes out,

643
00:23:58,644 --> 00:24:00,591
- you make everything worse.
- You know what, Esther?

644
00:24:00,627 --> 00:24:02,400
I was right to do what I did.

645
00:24:02,436 --> 00:24:04,592
And, for once,
I'm not gonna let you

646
00:24:04,628 --> 00:24:05,921
treat me like I'm less than you.

647
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:07,410
[chuckles]
Less than me?

648
00:24:07,447 --> 00:24:08,906
Yes, less than you!

649
00:24:08,943 --> 00:24:10,506
I'm always your buffoon brother.

650
00:24:10,544 --> 00:24:12,750
- Well, not this time.
- You had no right to do this

651
00:24:12,804 --> 00:24:14,644
- without asking me!
- I didn't ask you because

652
00:24:14,649 --> 00:24:16,473
- you wouldn't have listened.
- No, you never listen!

653
00:24:16,528 --> 00:24:19,621
Which is why I wanted to go to
Harvey in the first place!

654
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:25,327
- What?
- You heard me.

655
00:24:25,365 --> 00:24:26,963
How could you
betray me like that?

656
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,468
I wasn't betraying you.

657
00:24:29,504 --> 00:24:32,565
I was looking out for myself.

658
00:24:32,567 --> 00:24:35,209
If you were looking out
for yourself,

659
00:24:35,245 --> 00:24:36,982
then why did you lie to me
about going to him?

660
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:38,374
Because you're always jealous

661
00:24:38,411 --> 00:24:40,983
whenever I ask anyone else
to do anything.

662
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:44,289
You're my brother, Louis,
not my boyfriend.

663
00:24:44,326 --> 00:24:45,715
If you wanted Harvey so much,
why don't you go to him

664
00:24:45,769 --> 00:24:47,281
right now?

665
00:24:49,788 --> 00:24:51,258
I can't.

666
00:24:51,259 --> 00:24:54,353
Because when I went to him,

667
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:58,145
he told me I should trust you.

668
00:24:58,199 --> 00:25:01,763
- He really said that?
- He didn't just say that.

669
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:05,242
He said you were
a damn good lawyer.

670
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:07,364
I am a damn good lawyer.

671
00:25:10,761 --> 00:25:13,803
But I should have told you.

672
00:25:13,857 --> 00:25:15,543
Well...

673
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:17,456
What are we gonna do now?

674
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:22,327
That depends on if you
think you can trust me or not.

675
00:25:22,381 --> 00:25:24,119
I can.

676
00:25:28,776 --> 00:25:30,724
- Morning, Louis.
- Good morning.

677
00:25:30,726 --> 00:25:33,785
Where the hell were you?
I text you like 18 times.

678
00:25:33,821 --> 00:25:35,281
Yes, and if it had been
an emergency,

679
00:25:35,318 --> 00:25:37,528
- I would have called you back.
- It was an emergency.

680
00:25:37,545 --> 00:25:39,352
Louis, running out of
paper clips is not an emergency.

681
00:25:39,354 --> 00:25:41,544
I know, it's just that I...

682
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:43,457
needed you,
and I couldn't reach you,

683
00:25:43,494 --> 00:25:45,893
and that's never
happened before.

684
00:25:45,947 --> 00:25:49,511
I was having dinner with Harvey.

685
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:51,146
- Harvey?
- Yes.

686
00:25:51,183 --> 00:25:52,885
We're trying to stay friends.

687
00:25:52,923 --> 00:25:55,738
- Friends?
- Yes, friends.

688
00:25:55,776 --> 00:25:58,817
I'm not going back
to him, Louis.

689
00:25:58,872 --> 00:26:02,071
What?
I know that.

690
00:26:02,108 --> 00:26:03,254
How'd it go?

Well, it became my business

872

when Louis asked me
about it yesterday,

873
00:33:17,511 --> 00:33:18,849
and I had to lie to his face

874

to leave it alone.

What are you talking about?

892

I mean, you scheduled a session

893

so that we could
explore your mother,

894
00:33:55,774 --> 00:33:57,303

some meaningless story

895

about when you got stung
by a bee.

896
00:34:00,993 --> 00:34:02,313
I got in a fight with Donna.

897
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:04,088
Fight about what?

898
00:34:04,124 --> 00:34:05,164
She wants me to tell Louis

899
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:06,871
that I slept with his sister.

900
00:34:06,907 --> 00:34:08,888
Why, exactly, does she
want you to do that?

901
00:34:08,925 --> 00:34:11,254
Because I promised Louis
that I wouldn't,

902
00:34:11,291 --> 00:34:12,709
and she thinks
he's gonna find out.

903
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:14,786
Why would you make
a promise like that to Louis

904
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,403
if you had no intention
of keeping it?

905
00:34:16,441 --> 00:34:18,178
I had every intention
of keeping it.

906
00:34:18,214 --> 00:34:19,534
It's Louis's sister.

907
00:34:19,572 --> 00:34:21,970
But then I met her, and...

908
00:34:22,007 --> 00:34:23,153
it happened.

909
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:25,206
Well, why don't you
just tell him that?

910
00:34:25,242 --> 00:34:26,806
Because he's like
a four-year-old,

911
00:34:26,843 --> 00:34:28,303
and on top of that,
he doesn't own her.

912
00:34:28,339 --> 00:34:30,007
- She's his sister.
- But this isn't about

913
00:34:30,044 --> 00:34:31,294
his relationship
with his sister.

914
00:34:31,295 --> 00:34:33,172
It's about his relationship
with you.

You made him a promise.

00:34:34,773 --> 00:34:36,546
Yeah, and as long as he doesn't
find out I broke it,
