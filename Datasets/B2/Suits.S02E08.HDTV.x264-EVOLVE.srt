[Car horn blares]

2
00:00:10,879 --> 00:00:11,912
You're late.

3
00:00:11,914 --> 00:00:13,047
Nope. 30 seconds early.

4
00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:14,849
Good. Learning to tell time.

5
00:00:14,851 --> 00:00:15,950
Ha ha ha.

6
00:00:15,952 --> 00:00:17,384
I won't be in today.

7
00:00:17,386 --> 00:00:19,153
What? Does Jessica know?

8
00:00:19,155 --> 00:00:20,588
I don't tell Jessica
everything.

9
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:22,456
Oh, it's like a "Harvey
Specter's day off"

10
00:00:22,458 --> 00:00:23,858
kind of a thing?
Should I call Ed Rooney,

11
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:25,226
see if we can
get Sloane out of school?

12
00:00:25,228 --> 00:00:26,560
Not in the mood today.

13
00:00:26,562 --> 00:00:27,895
Life moves pretty fast
if you don't

14
00:00:27,897 --> 00:00:29,396
stop and look around
once in a while.

15
00:00:29,398 --> 00:00:30,464
What do you think about
Hardman running for

16
00:00:30,466 --> 00:00:31,565
managing partner?

17
00:00:31,567 --> 00:00:33,033
- Think he's going to win.
- Why?

18
00:00:33,035 --> 00:00:34,802
Because you don't
call for a vote

19
00:00:34,804 --> 00:00:35,970
unless you have the votes.

20
00:00:35,972 --> 00:00:37,171
Good.

21
00:00:37,173 --> 00:00:39,206
We need to tip the scales
in her favor.

22
00:00:39,208 --> 00:00:40,241
Okay. What do you
need me to do?

23
00:00:40,243 --> 00:00:41,242
I need you to step up.

24
00:00:41,244 --> 00:00:42,843
You're not going to like it.

25
00:00:42,845 --> 00:00:44,879
And Jessica can't know
it came from me.

26
00:00:44,881 --> 00:00:46,981
I gave Hardman the road map
to settling with Tanner.

27
00:00:46,983 --> 00:00:48,082
You voted for it.

28
00:00:48,084 --> 00:00:49,216
Haven't we done enough
to Jessica?

29
00:00:49,218 --> 00:00:51,085
We're not doing this
to Jessica,

30
00:00:51,087 --> 00:00:54,021
we're doing this <i>for</i> Jessica.

31
00:00:54,023 --> 00:00:56,056
We gonna cross the line
with this?

32
00:00:56,058 --> 00:00:57,291
We've been crossing lines

33
00:00:57,293 --> 00:00:59,059
long before we even ever met.

34
00:01:23,385 --> 00:01:25,753
How do I know the Patriots
aren't going 19-0?

35
00:01:25,755 --> 00:01:28,522
Because no team from Boston
is going undefeated

36
00:01:28,524 --> 00:01:30,491
when the road
goes through New York.

37
00:01:30,493 --> 00:01:31,659
You got that right.

38
00:01:31,661 --> 00:01:33,294
Goddamn Patriots.

39
00:01:33,296 --> 00:01:35,529
- Your dad called.
- I'll call him later.

40
00:01:35,531 --> 00:01:36,931
He always asks why
the idiots in charge

41
00:01:36,933 --> 00:01:38,465
haven't made you partner yet.

42
00:01:38,467 --> 00:01:40,367
He's so proud. It's sweet.

43
00:01:40,369 --> 00:01:43,604
He's right.

44
00:01:43,606 --> 00:01:45,606
You have that look
on your face.

45
00:01:47,809 --> 00:01:49,610
Louis is getting a secretary.

46
00:01:49,612 --> 00:01:50,911
Her name...

47
00:01:50,913 --> 00:01:52,146
is Norma.

48
00:01:52,148 --> 00:01:53,180
What is she, 100 years old?

49
00:01:53,182 --> 00:01:54,181
She won't last a week.

50
00:01:54,183 --> 00:01:56,383
You heard it here first.

51
00:01:56,385 --> 00:02:00,321
Oh, and Jessica's
on her way down.

52
00:02:00,323 --> 00:02:03,324
So, you buried the Jessica news

53
00:02:03,326 --> 00:02:04,792
to lead with the Louis news.

54
00:02:04,794 --> 00:02:07,528
I'm not apologizing
for who I am.

55
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:09,263
[Knocking, door squeaking open]

56
00:02:09,265 --> 00:02:11,665
Hi, is this the location of
the douchebag convention?

57
00:02:11,667 --> 00:02:14,234
It is now.

58
00:02:14,236 --> 00:02:15,569
I thought you went to work.

59
00:02:15,571 --> 00:02:17,805
- I had to get this.
- Whoa.

60
00:02:17,807 --> 00:02:20,140
Look at that.
The world's smallest burrito.

61
00:02:20,142 --> 00:02:22,276
Which is why I got more.

62
00:02:22,278 --> 00:02:25,479
Whoa. Breakfast of champions.

63
00:02:25,481 --> 00:02:26,513
Trevor, I can't.

64
00:02:26,515 --> 00:02:27,615
I'm a bike messenger.

65
00:02:27,617 --> 00:02:31,085
I deliver packages,
or people die.

66
00:02:31,087 --> 00:02:32,653
Am I gonna have to give you
a code red?

67
00:02:32,655 --> 00:02:34,355
Both: Mm...

68
00:02:34,357 --> 00:02:35,623
- Okay.
- Ohh.

69
00:02:35,625 --> 00:02:37,625
All you did was weaken
a country today, Kaffee.

70
00:02:37,627 --> 00:02:41,161
Well, what can I say?

71
00:02:41,163 --> 00:02:44,765
Really? Okay.

72
00:02:44,767 --> 00:02:46,567
- I gotta go to work.
- Thank you.

73
00:02:46,569 --> 00:02:48,469
Remember, we're going out
tonight, so...

74
00:02:48,471 --> 00:02:50,170
you know, don't be you.

75
00:02:50,172 --> 00:02:52,306
Oh, wait a minute. I still
owe you from last week.

76
00:02:52,308 --> 00:02:53,707
No, no, no, you get
the dickhead discount.

77
00:02:53,709 --> 00:02:55,776
Oh, is that 30%? Or is that
the shitface coupon?

78
00:02:55,778 --> 00:02:57,444
Same thing, because you're
a shitface and a dickhead.

79
00:02:57,446 --> 00:02:58,779
Right, got it.
Have a great day!

80
00:02:58,781 --> 00:02:59,880
Later, asshole.

81
00:02:59,882 --> 00:03:01,882
Later. [Door closes]

82
00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:04,985
Shit.

83
00:03:11,826 --> 00:03:13,127
I need your help on something.

84
00:03:13,129 --> 00:03:14,762
Show me the skulls,
I'll crack 'em.

85
00:03:14,764 --> 00:03:17,398
Not for this. For this,
I need your discretion.

86
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,366
I also need to know
you'll take it seriously.

87
00:03:19,368 --> 00:03:20,768
I haven't worked in
the mail room

88
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:23,237
in a long time, Jessica.

89
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:26,040
Someone's stealing from our
clients' escrow accounts.

90
00:03:26,042 --> 00:03:27,207
Why isn't Daniel here?

91
00:03:27,209 --> 00:03:29,076
Daniel's managing partner.

92
00:03:29,078 --> 00:03:30,477
Isn't that why Daniel
should be here?

93
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:32,312
And I'm in charge of the money.

94
00:03:32,314 --> 00:03:35,015
Oh, you want to go to him with
a solution, not a problem.

95
00:03:35,017 --> 00:03:36,417
You don't always have to
let your superiors know

96
00:03:36,419 --> 00:03:38,419
what you're up to.
I'll try to remember that.

97
00:03:38,421 --> 00:03:39,520
Really? I thought you were
under the impression

98
00:03:39,522 --> 00:03:41,221
you had invented it.

99
00:03:41,223 --> 00:03:42,256
What do you need me to do?

100
00:03:42,258 --> 00:03:43,557
I need you to step up.

101
00:03:43,559 --> 00:03:45,559
Do whatever you have to do
to find out who did it,

102
00:03:45,561 --> 00:03:47,661
and do it quietly. I will.

103
00:03:47,663 --> 00:03:48,829
And when I do,

104
00:03:48,831 --> 00:03:52,032
I want you to step up for me.

105
00:03:52,034 --> 00:03:54,234
What do you want, Harvey?

106
00:03:54,236 --> 00:03:56,370
I'm an associate
who kicks more ass

107
00:03:56,372 --> 00:03:59,506
than any partner
in this goddamn firm.

108
00:03:59,508 --> 00:04:01,608

00:04:37,304 --> 00:04:38,470
Watson scares the kids,

120
00:04:38,472 --> 00:04:39,905
but I don't make him
for the embezzler.

121
00:04:39,907 --> 00:04:42,441
The embezzler?
He's not a Batman villain.

122
00:04:42,443 --> 00:04:44,042
And it's just that kind of
thinking that has led you

123
00:04:44,044 --> 00:04:45,243
to not catching him.

124
00:04:45,245 --> 00:04:47,546
I was just assigned this
15 minutes ago.

125
00:04:47,548 --> 00:04:49,114
Have you ever looked into
Dortch's eyes?

126
00:04:49,116 --> 00:04:51,216
- Yeah, he's cross-eyed.
- Or is he?

127
00:04:51,218 --> 00:04:52,617
What does that even mean?

128
00:04:52,619 --> 00:04:54,019
Is there a reward for this?

129
00:04:54,021 --> 00:04:56,688
Yes. I make Jessica happy,
I make partner.

130
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:57,889
Ooh, then we get
a bigger office.

131
00:04:57,891 --> 00:04:58,990
Then I get a bigger office.

132
00:04:58,992 --> 00:05:00,158
Hey, I'm helping you out here.

133
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,226
Are you?

134
00:05:01,228 --> 00:05:02,627
What do you think
about Ginsberg?

135
00:05:02,629 --> 00:05:03,829
We need to follow the money.

136
00:05:03,831 --> 00:05:05,931
Which will lead
straight to Rutherford.

137
00:05:05,933 --> 00:05:07,866
This would be so much more fun
with margaritas.

138
00:05:07,868 --> 00:05:09,368
Okay, that's it. I need facts,

139
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:10,569
and I need them right now.
Well then,

140
00:05:10,571 --> 00:05:11,837
why did you ask me to
guess who did it?

141
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:13,071
I didn't.

142
00:05:13,073 --> 00:05:14,639
- Then why am I here?
- I need you to tell me

143
00:05:14,641 --> 00:05:16,808
who handles these five
escrow accounts.

144
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:18,777
Oh. Well, that's easy.

145
00:05:18,779 --> 00:05:20,379
Zoe.

146
00:05:20,381 --> 00:05:23,115
God, why didn't you just say so
in the first place?

147
00:05:23,117 --> 00:05:26,718
Get out.

148
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,919
If you want to talk to
Monica Eton,

149
00:05:27,921 --> 00:05:29,087
call her yourself.

150
00:05:29,089 --> 00:05:30,655
I called her, but she hung up

151
00:05:30,657 --> 00:05:31,990
the minute I said
Pearson Hardman.

152
00:05:31,992 --> 00:05:33,925
Of course she did.
She hates everybody here.

153
00:05:33,927 --> 00:05:35,394
- She doesn't hate you.
- Well, no,

154
00:05:35,396 --> 00:05:36,561
but that's because
I'm adorable.

155
00:05:36,563 --> 00:05:38,029
See, I can't help you
with that.

156
00:05:38,031 --> 00:05:39,798
So why don't you try using
your powers of adorability

157
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,166
for good? Not a word.

158
00:05:41,168 --> 00:05:43,702
And that is not being adorable.

159
00:05:43,704 --> 00:05:45,837
Mike, seriously, this is

160
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:47,038
not a small thing.

161
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,473
Look, the last time you
asked me to help you

162
00:05:48,475 --> 00:05:50,409
it was about Donna, and look at
how that turned out.

163
00:05:50,411 --> 00:05:53,044
Okay, that wasn't me,
and this isn't that...

164
00:05:53,046 --> 00:05:54,813
Monica Eton is not Donna.

165
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:57,182
Maybe not, but she still
means something to me.

166
00:05:57,184 --> 00:05:59,684
So tell me why I should
convince her to talk to someone

167
00:05:59,686 --> 00:06:01,553
who works at a firm
that she hates.

168
00:06:01,555 --> 00:06:03,288
Because...

169
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:04,322
You don't know

170
00:06:04,324 --> 00:06:07,092
the real reason why she left.

171
00:06:12,799 --> 00:06:13,932
Monica.

172
00:06:13,934 --> 00:06:15,700
Hey, it's so funny
running into you.

173
00:06:15,702 --> 00:06:17,436
Louis, we both work here.

174
00:06:17,438 --> 00:06:18,737
Yeah. Listen, I just wanted
to tell you that

175
00:06:18,739 --> 00:06:19,971
I joined
the Hudson Racquet Club.

176
00:06:19,973 --> 00:06:21,106
You know, I just figured
I'd treat myself

177
00:06:21,108 --> 00:06:22,274
for making junior partner.

178
00:06:22,276 --> 00:06:23,809
Good for you.

179
00:06:23,811 --> 00:06:25,076
Yeah, I'd love to get you
out on the court.

180
00:06:25,078 --> 00:06:26,411
Maybe like, if you're
available Saturday?

181
00:06:26,413 --> 00:06:27,813
- I can't.
- I can't Saturday, but...

182
00:06:27,815 --> 00:06:29,047
Monica, Louis.

183
00:06:29,049 --> 00:06:30,449
- Harvey.
- H-dog.

184
00:06:30,451 --> 00:06:31,650
- No.
- What?

185
00:06:31,652 --> 00:06:33,251
No, listen. I wanted to
talk to you about...

186
00:06:33,253 --> 00:06:34,753
Cashing and burning
with Monica?

187
00:06:34,755 --> 00:06:36,354
I didn't crash and burn
with her.

188
00:06:36,356 --> 00:06:38,223
So why don't you stop quoting
whatever "B" movie

189
00:06:38,225 --> 00:06:40,192
that came from, and call me
when you finally see <i>Amadeus.</i>

190
00:06:40,194 --> 00:06:42,160
Salieri, Mozart.

191
00:06:42,162 --> 00:06:43,829
Are you wearing braces?

192
00:06:43,831 --> 00:06:45,297
- Proudly.
- Walk me through that.

193
00:06:45,299 --> 00:06:46,431
I will walk you through it.

194
00:06:46,433 --> 00:06:49,000
Uh, for starters,
it costs $15,000...

195
00:06:49,002 --> 00:06:50,702
Okay, I don't have time
for this.

196
00:06:50,704 --> 00:06:52,204
I heard you had a closed-door
meeting with Jessica.

197
00:06:52,206 --> 00:06:54,606
I did. Or I didn't.

198
00:06:54,608 --> 00:06:55,941
Either way, it's
none of your business.

199
00:06:55,943 --> 00:06:57,309
I just think it's weird
when, you know,

200
00:06:57,311 --> 00:06:58,710
you have a one-on-one with her,

201
00:06:58,712 --> 00:07:00,078
when you're an associate
and I'm a junior partner.

202
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,413
Proudly wearing braces.

203
00:07:01,415 --> 00:07:03,949
You mi... for your information,
it is a very small step

204
00:07:03,951 --> 00:07:05,951
from junior to senior partner
when you have straight teeth.

205
00:07:05,953 --> 00:07:07,352
Just know that people take you
very seriously.

206
00:07:07,354 --> 00:07:09,588
[Snapping fingers]
That tie. I have the same one.

207
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:10,922
I don't want to see it again.

208
00:07:10,924 --> 00:07:13,592
What would he have said if you
weren't wearing braces?

209
00:07:13,594 --> 00:07:14,993
What a dick.

210
00:07:14,995 --> 00:07:17,696
Mark my words, if I am ever
in charge of anyone,

211
00:07:17,698 --> 00:07:18,897
I am going to be the most
beloved leader

212
00:07:18,899 --> 00:07:20,866
that those lucky bastards
have ever seen.

213
00:07:20,868 --> 00:07:22,968
You know what I'd do, I'd be...

214
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:25,937
H-dog? H-dog?

215
00:07:25,939 --> 00:07:27,739
Zoe Lawford.

216
00:07:27,741 --> 00:07:29,074
I'm sorry, you are?

217
00:07:29,076 --> 00:07:30,876
The only man here who could
beat you at pool.

218
00:07:30,878 --> 00:07:32,277
Uh, head-to-head is even.

219
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:33,478
I'm up by one.

220
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,946
Well, I thought you'd
given up altogether.

221
00:07:34,948 --> 00:07:36,214
You don't call,
you don't write.

222
00:07:36,216 --> 00:07:37,983
I was just trying to give it
a little time.

223
00:07:37,985 --> 00:07:40,485
You know, letting mystery
build back up.

224
00:07:40,487 --> 00:07:42,220
You mean you didn't know
I transferred

225
00:07:42,222 --> 00:07:43,688
to beautiful escrow.

226
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:45,123
Hey, I have my finger
on the pulse.

227
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:47,259
[Laughing] Really?

228
00:07:47,261 --> 00:07:48,960
Name three associates
in tax law.

229
00:07:48,962 --> 00:07:50,929
Boring, more boring,

230
00:07:50,931 --> 00:07:52,163
and boring in a skirt.

231
00:07:52,165 --> 00:07:54,966
Oh! August 3rd.

232
00:07:54,968 --> 00:07:56,234
Date of my transfer.

233
00:07:56,236 --> 00:07:57,569
I did know.

234
00:07:57,571 --> 00:08:00,071
We miss you up there.

235
00:08:00,073 --> 00:08:01,439
We miss me, or you miss me?

236
00:08:01,441 --> 00:08:02,908
We miss you.

237
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:06,411
I need you.

238
00:08:06,413 --> 00:08:08,313
You're here to look at my
files, aren't you?

239
00:08:08,315 --> 00:08:09,614
I need you to type in
your password

240
00:08:09,616 --> 00:08:11,550
and leave for five minutes.

241
00:08:11,552 --> 00:08:12,717
You're doing something wrong.

242
00:08:12,719 --> 00:08:13,919
No, I'm fixing something wrong.

243
00:08:13,921 --> 00:08:15,353
- Fixing what?
- That, I can't tell you.

244
00:08:15,355 --> 00:08:16,521
Why? Don't trust me?

245
00:08:16,523 --> 00:08:17,889
I do. But if I tell you,

246
00:08:17,891 --> 00:08:20,158
then I'm breaking
someone's trust in me.

247
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,327
Okay, let me just
get this straight.

248
00:08:22,329 --> 00:08:24,229
You're asking me
to risk my job to help you

249
00:08:24,231 --> 00:08:26,731
solve a mysterious problem
for an unknown person,

250
00:08:26,733 --> 00:08:29,701
based on nothing but your word?

251
00:08:29,703 --> 00:08:31,903
That's exactly what I'm asking.

252
00:08:31,905 --> 00:08:34,739
Ahh.

253
00:08:34,741 --> 00:08:36,708
[Keyboard clacking]

254
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:39,311
Oh my God, there's an emergency
in wills and trusts.

255
00:08:46,586 --> 00:08:49,321
Thank you. Cheers.
[Bottles clinking]

256
00:08:49,323 --> 00:08:51,523
You ready?
I am. Hit me, hit me.

257
00:08:51,525 --> 00:08:53,158
All right, um... All right.

258
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,459
This guy. Favorite movie.

259
00:08:54,461 --> 00:08:55,994
<i>Grease.</i>

260
00:08:55,996 --> 00:08:57,696
Both: <i>2.</i>
<i>- Yes, I agree with you.</i>

261
00:08:57,698 --> 00:08:58,964
Oh. What about this,

262
00:08:58,966 --> 00:09:01,099
Rico Suave over here,
what are you thinking?

263
00:09:01,101 --> 00:09:02,200
Shaves his chest.

264
00:09:02,202 --> 00:09:03,602
No. No, no, man,

265
00:09:03,604 --> 00:09:05,370
that's a thing that like,
real men do now.

266
00:09:05,372 --> 00:09:06,671
Oh, I don't think so.

267
00:09:06,673 --> 00:09:07,973
- Yeah...
- I'm sorry,

268
00:09:07,975 --> 00:09:10,108
did you just say real men
shave their chests?

269
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:12,010
Oh, um, not... not real men.

270
00:09:12,012 --> 00:09:15,113
Just me. That's all.

271
00:09:15,115 --> 00:09:16,448
I like him. He's funny.

272
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:17,515
- And hairless.
- Oh, I'm Jenny.

273
00:09:17,517 --> 00:09:20,418
Mike.

274
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:23,121
And just so you guys know, uh,
he shaves his chest

275
00:09:23,123 --> 00:09:25,724
because he is, I'm very proud
of him, an Olympic swimmer.

276
00:09:25,726 --> 00:09:27,092
- I am.
- Is that right?

277
00:09:27,094 --> 00:09:29,494
So that's what you do when you
meet girls, you lie?

278
00:09:29,496 --> 00:09:31,696
- Totally.
- If they're hot.

279
00:09:31,698 --> 00:09:35,000
We also buy them drinks,
I'm not sure if...

280
00:09:35,002 --> 00:09:36,101
- Oh, we drink.
- Uh, yeah.

281
00:09:36,103 --> 00:09:40,038
- Bartender?
- Yeah? No, go for it.

282
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,606
Wait, no way a girl
thought you were

283
00:09:41,608 --> 00:09:42,807
a point guard for the Knicks.

284
00:09:42,809 --> 00:09:44,242
Well, you've never
seen me dribble.

285
00:09:44,244 --> 00:09:45,744
Uh, I would like to know
something about you

286
00:09:45,746 --> 00:09:47,145
that's not a lie.

287
00:09:47,147 --> 00:09:48,680
Ooh.

288
00:09:48,682 --> 00:09:50,982
Um...

289
00:09:50,984 --> 00:09:52,183
I love my grandmother.

290
00:09:52,185 --> 00:09:54,352
Well, now we know why
he's single.

291
00:09:54,354 --> 00:09:56,021
Come on, it's kind of sweet.

292
00:09:56,023 --> 00:09:58,123
Look, I...
I'm not usually in it for him,

293
00:09:58,125 --> 00:09:59,624
but I really gotta
step in here.

294
00:09:59,626 --> 00:10:01,026
Um...

295
00:10:01,028 --> 00:10:02,694
Dude's a genius. Trevor, stop.

296
00:10:02,696 --> 00:10:04,295
- No, no, no...
- What do you mean, genius?

297
00:10:04,297 --> 00:10:06,197
- All right.
- It's not a thing, it's just...

298
00:10:06,199 --> 00:10:07,365
No, no, no, here we go.

299
00:10:07,367 --> 00:10:10,335
Ask him a math question.
Hard as you want.

300
00:10:10,337 --> 00:10:11,736
- Trevor.
- Hard as you want!

301
00:10:11,738 --> 00:10:12,837
Anything.

302
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:15,974
What's 75 times 863,

303
00:10:15,976 --> 00:10:20,078
minus 10?

304
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,213
64,715.

305
00:10:22,215 --> 00:10:23,982
- Bang.
- How do we know that's right?

306
00:10:23,984 --> 00:10:27,686
Uh, it's right. It's right.

307
00:10:27,688 --> 00:10:29,621
All right, think of a book
you read in high school,

308
00:10:29,623 --> 00:10:31,656
he will recite the first page...
I don't want to do this,

309
00:10:31,658 --> 00:10:33,091
- Verbatim.
- I don't want to do it.

310
00:10:33,093 --> 00:10:36,161
Come on, come on, come on,
just do it... do it for me.

311
00:10:36,163 --> 00:10:40,065
<i>Moby Dick.</i>

312
00:10:40,067 --> 00:10:41,499
"Call me Ishmael.
Some years ago,"

313
00:10:41,501 --> 00:10:44,436
"never mind how long ago
precisely,"

314
00:10:44,438 --> 00:10:45,637
"having little or no money..."

315
00:10:45,639 --> 00:10:48,039
<i>Old Man and the Sea.</i>

316
00:10:48,041 --> 00:10:51,509
"The box with the baits was
under the stern of the skiff"

317
00:10:51,511 --> 00:10:54,646
"along with the club that was
used to subdue the big fish..."

318
00:10:54,648 --> 00:10:56,748
I know that one,
that's not right.

319
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:59,684
Oh, no, no, no.
I got bored, I did page seven.

320
00:10:59,686 --> 00:11:03,321
<i>Curious George.</i>

321
00:11:03,323 --> 00:11:04,689
I can't.

322
00:11:04,691 --> 00:11:06,825
I can't do that.
What? Come on, you can do

323
00:11:06,827 --> 00:11:08,326
the other ones, you don't know
<i>Curious George?</i>

324
00:11:08,328 --> 00:11:09,661
I never read <i>Curious George.</i>

325
00:11:09,663 --> 00:11:11,329
You never read <i>Curious George?</i>

326
00:11:11,331 --> 00:11:12,697
Monkeys freak me out.

327
00:11:12,699 --> 00:11:14,232
My girlfriend and I
have to go to the bathroom.

328
00:11:14,234 --> 00:11:16,201
Mmhmm.

329
00:11:16,203 --> 00:11:18,336
I have to go to the bathroom.

330
00:11:18,338 --> 00:11:20,171
And when we come back,
these drinkies...

331
00:11:20,173 --> 00:11:23,374
Will be filled.
Absolutely, 100%.

332
00:11:23,376 --> 00:11:24,876
[Sighs heavily]

333
00:11:24,878 --> 00:11:26,978
Dude, what are you doing?

334
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:28,313
Are you trying to blow this?

335
00:11:28,315 --> 00:11:29,814
What are you talking about?

336
00:11:29,816 --> 00:11:30,982
I know that you have
<i>Curious George,</i>

337
00:11:30,984 --> 00:11:32,083
I've seen it on your bookshelf.

338
00:11:32,085 --> 00:11:33,718
For once, we don't have to lie.

339
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:36,054
My mom gave me that book.
She read it to me every night.

340
00:11:36,056 --> 00:11:37,789
I'm not going to use it
to just pick up some girl.

341
00:11:37,791 --> 00:11:39,390
You don't have to do anything.

342
00:11:39,392 --> 00:11:41,726
Let me tell them. Okay?

343
00:11:41,728 --> 00:11:43,061
You'll probably go home
with both of them.

344
00:11:43,063 --> 00:11:45,730
Trevor. Stop.

345
00:11:49,468 --> 00:11:51,136
Fine.

346
00:11:51,138 --> 00:11:52,437
I hate your guts.

347
00:12:03,015 --> 00:12:04,916
I followed the money.

348
00:12:04,918 --> 00:12:06,217
Let's hear it.

349
00:12:06,219 --> 00:12:08,686
Louis Litt is the man
we're looking for.

350
00:12:08,688 --> 00:12:10,421
Are you sure?

351
00:12:10,423 --> 00:12:11,790
I told you
I followed the money.

352
00:12:11,792 --> 00:12:13,892
Which, by the way, he's been
spending left and right.

353
00:12:13,894 --> 00:12:15,326
You're talking about
the braces.

354
00:12:15,328 --> 00:12:16,728
$15,000.

355
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:18,863
Not to mention
the Hudson Racquet Club.

356
00:12:18,865 --> 00:12:20,231
Who knows what else?

357
00:12:20,233 --> 00:12:23,301
That club costs $60,000 a year.

358
00:12:23,303 --> 00:12:26,137
What are you going to do?

359
00:12:26,139 --> 00:12:27,639
I'm gonna break him down,

360
00:12:27,641 --> 00:12:30,575
and I'm gonna crack him open.

361
00:12:49,705 --> 00:12:51,938
[Knocking on glass door ]

362
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:53,603
You wanted to see me?

363
00:12:53,605 --> 00:12:55,539
I did.

364
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:57,340
Well, if this is about Norma?

365
00:12:57,342 --> 00:12:59,276
Truth be told, we can
do a lot better.

366
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:03,046
This isn't about Norma.

367
00:13:03,048 --> 00:13:04,514
Pray tell.

368
00:13:04,516 --> 00:13:05,715
How can your your newest
junior partner

369
00:13:05,717 --> 00:13:07,150
be of service to thee?

370
00:13:07,152 --> 00:13:09,052
Pray tell?

371
00:13:09,054 --> 00:13:11,688
You can pray tell me

372
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:13,056
how the hell you got the nerve

373
00:13:13,058 --> 00:13:15,392
to stand in front of my face

374
00:13:15,394 --> 00:13:18,395
after what you did.

375
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,401
I couldn't help it.

376
00:13:24,403 --> 00:13:25,635
All those late nights.

377
00:13:25,637 --> 00:13:28,705
Your fibers are so tantalizing.

378
00:13:28,707 --> 00:13:30,674
What?

379
00:13:30,676 --> 00:13:32,542
I fell asleep on your couch,

380
00:13:32,544 --> 00:13:34,945
just once, because it's
so damn soft.

381
00:13:34,947 --> 00:13:38,548
Not the topic of
this conversation.

382
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:39,783
Is this about
the MySpace profile?

383
00:13:39,785 --> 00:13:44,387
Because I can take that down.

384
00:13:44,389 --> 00:13:46,123
Okay, fine.

385
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:47,324
You got me.

386
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:48,758
I've copied the complete
works of Shakespeare

387
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,494
and I've charged it to
those bastards at C.M.,

388
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:51,895
I regularly raid Harvey's
liquor, and I've

389
00:13:51,897 --> 00:13:53,430
taken every raspberry-bran bar
from the kitchen

390
00:13:53,432 --> 00:13:54,764
that we've ever bought... Louis...

391
00:13:54,766 --> 00:13:55,765
I need to know where
Stanley gets them, do you?

392
00:13:55,767 --> 00:13:59,069
Enough!

393
00:13:59,071 --> 00:14:00,704
Well, should I just...

394
00:14:00,706 --> 00:14:02,973
what, pack my things?

395
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:04,708
Not necessary.

396
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:05,842
Thank you, Jessica.

397
00:14:05,844 --> 00:14:09,412
Thank you for your mercy.

398
00:14:09,414 --> 00:14:10,981
Louis.

399
00:14:10,983 --> 00:14:12,315
Yeah.

400
00:14:12,317 --> 00:14:14,584
You will replace every one of
those goddamn bran bars.

401
00:14:14,586 --> 00:14:16,286
Yes.

402
00:14:16,288 --> 00:14:18,355
And, I promise not to walk
barefoot in the library

403
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:19,389
ever again. Out.

404
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:20,857
Okay.

405
00:14:27,198 --> 00:14:28,365
Next time you bring me a name,

406
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:29,900
make goddamn sure
it's the right one.

407
00:14:29,902 --> 00:14:31,234
I followed the money.

408
00:14:31,236 --> 00:14:32,435
You got lost on the way.

409
00:14:32,437 --> 00:14:34,504
You saying Louis was framed?

410
00:14:34,506 --> 00:14:36,673
I'm saying you shit the bed.

411
00:14:36,675 --> 00:14:38,575
I gave you a job to do,
and you promptly

412
00:14:38,577 --> 00:14:40,177
asked for a seat at the table.

413
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:41,511
You want to sit
with the grown-ups?

414
00:14:41,513 --> 00:14:43,513
Do your job like a man.

415
00:14:48,452 --> 00:14:49,786
Ouch.

416
00:14:49,788 --> 00:14:51,188
What?

417
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:52,722
You need me to remove
Jessica's foot from your ass?

418
00:14:52,724 --> 00:14:53,990
You heard all that?

419
00:14:53,992 --> 00:14:55,125
Intercom was on.

420
00:14:55,127 --> 00:14:56,893
Couldn't help myself.

421
00:14:56,895 --> 00:14:58,195
Has it ever been on before?

422
00:14:58,197 --> 00:14:59,362
Has it ever been off?

423
00:14:59,364 --> 00:15:00,463
Wait, what?

424
00:15:00,465 --> 00:15:01,865
I listen to your
private conversations?

425
00:15:01,867 --> 00:15:02,899
Gotta go.

426
00:15:02,901 --> 00:15:04,801
- Wait.
- What?

427
00:15:04,803 --> 00:15:06,002
I don't like to be wrong.

428
00:15:06,004 --> 00:15:07,170
It made sense, Harvey.

429
00:15:07,172 --> 00:15:08,605
Louis is the firm's
financial wizard.

430
00:15:08,607 --> 00:15:10,240
Look. Louis might not
have done it,

431
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:12,042
but he can help me
figure out who did.

432
00:15:12,044 --> 00:15:14,377
You're going to ask Louis
for help on something this big?

433
00:15:14,379 --> 00:15:16,746
When a dog smells a bone,
he digs.

434
00:15:16,748 --> 00:15:17,881
Doesn't mean you
have to tell him

435
00:15:17,883 --> 00:15:19,950
what kind of bone
he's digging for.

436
00:15:19,952 --> 00:15:21,418
Just so we're clear,

437
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,687
I'm gonna keep listening to
your private conversations.

438
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:25,755
- Pickles.
- Peppers.

439
00:15:25,757 --> 00:15:26,756
Here you go.

440
00:15:26,758 --> 00:15:28,091
Here you go. That's fine.

441
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:29,326
Oh yeah, that girl Nikki
called me.

442
00:15:29,328 --> 00:15:30,927
Oh, that's awesome.

443
00:15:30,929 --> 00:15:32,629
I don't even know how she got
my number, it's weird.

444
00:15:32,631 --> 00:15:33,897
I do.

445
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:36,366
I asked her out.
She wanted your number instead.

446
00:15:36,368 --> 00:15:38,935
I didn't tell her about
the <i>Curious George</i> thing.

447
00:15:38,937 --> 00:15:39,970
What?

448
00:15:39,972 --> 00:15:41,538
I don't know, it's...

449
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:42,906
I just felt like I kind of
hit it off more

450
00:15:42,908 --> 00:15:44,040
with that Jenny girl,
that's all.

451
00:15:44,042 --> 00:15:45,041
The blonde?

452
00:15:45,043 --> 00:15:46,876
She's not even as hot.

453
00:15:46,878 --> 00:15:48,778
I liked her better.

454
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:49,980
Well, you can't
do anything now.

455
00:15:49,982 --> 00:15:53,083
Girls have rules about
that kind of shit.

456
00:15:53,085 --> 00:15:54,618
Wait a minute.

457
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,319
Are you... is this a snake?

458
00:15:56,321 --> 00:15:58,054
Are you snaking my girl
right now?

459
00:15:58,056 --> 00:15:59,689
No, I already did.

460
00:15:59,691 --> 00:16:01,424
- You called her?
- Of course I did.

461
00:16:01,426 --> 00:16:02,759
- What a dick.
- [Laughing] What?

462
00:16:02,761 --> 00:16:04,094
- Son of a bitch.
- I... I don't have

463
00:16:04,096 --> 00:16:05,428
rules against that shit. Okay.

464
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:07,330
Aw, whatever. That Nikki girl's
pretty hot too.

465
00:16:07,332 --> 00:16:09,332
Yeah.

466
00:16:09,334 --> 00:16:12,269
Look at this clown.

467
00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:15,138
He walks like he's got
a rod up his ass.

468
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,873
Nice haircut, guy.

469
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:20,010
Man, if I ever look like that,
shoot me.

470
00:16:20,012 --> 00:16:22,612
Monica, you work late
all the time.

471
00:16:22,614 --> 00:16:24,714
I'm not 22. You are.

472
00:16:24,716 --> 00:16:27,150
All I'm saying is, you work
80 hours a week

473
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:28,585
while studying for the LSATs
every night.

474
00:16:28,587 --> 00:16:30,420
Well right, but that's because
this time next year

475
00:16:30,422 --> 00:16:32,622
I want to be in law school,
and five years from now

476
00:16:32,624 --> 00:16:33,923
I want to be a lawyer.

477
00:16:33,925 --> 00:16:35,492
Five years from now,
you're gonna be

478
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:38,762
a kick-ass lawyer
at Pearson Hardman.

479
00:16:43,567 --> 00:16:46,970
How often does Louis
ask you out?

480
00:16:46,972 --> 00:16:48,305
Every single day.

481
00:16:48,307 --> 00:16:49,539
There are laws
to protect you from

482
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:51,141
sexual harassment, you know.

483
00:16:51,143 --> 00:16:53,376
Believe me, the day I need
a law to protect me from Louis

484
00:16:53,378 --> 00:16:55,578
is the day I stop
being a lawyer.

485
00:16:57,815 --> 00:16:59,449
Busy?

486
00:16:59,451 --> 00:17:01,017
Very funny, Harvey, let's get
to it, okay?

487
00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:02,185
Because you happen to be
interrupting

488
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:04,321
my lunchtime sanctuary.

489
00:17:04,323 --> 00:17:06,423
You think I don't know
lunchtime sanctuary

490
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:07,691
means staring at Monica?

491
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:08,892
First of all,
I'll have you know that

492
00:17:08,894 --> 00:17:10,427
I have been coming here
way before her.

493
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:12,996
And I will be coming here
every Thursday at 1:00 p.m.

494
00:17:12,998 --> 00:17:14,264
till the day I die.

495
00:17:14,266 --> 00:17:18,501
Now let me see your friend's
financials.

496
00:17:18,503 --> 00:17:19,703
Why are the names
all blacked out?

497
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:21,571
Because of how sensitive it is.

498
00:17:21,573 --> 00:17:23,506
How sensitive is it?

499
00:17:23,508 --> 00:17:25,275
He works at a powerful firm.

500
00:17:25,277 --> 00:17:27,444
I can't tell you which one.

501
00:17:27,446 --> 00:17:28,745
They have an embezzler.

502
00:17:28,747 --> 00:17:30,580
Ahh, so that's what your

503
00:17:30,582 --> 00:17:32,982
closed-door meeting
with Jessica was about.

504
00:17:32,984 --> 00:17:34,451
We're being hired
by another firm.

505
00:17:34,453 --> 00:17:36,920
I'm sworn to secrecy.

506
00:17:36,922 --> 00:17:38,722
If we can figure out
who this is,

507
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:41,324
a very big head will roll.

508
00:17:41,326 --> 00:17:45,628
Where? Hufton and Wood?

509
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:47,564
Bagwell and Rose?

510
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:50,233
Oh, come on. Those assholes
at Jacobson and Kearney?

511
00:17:53,437 --> 00:17:55,972
[Whispering] Look, I told you,
I was sworn to secrecy.

512
00:17:55,974 --> 00:17:59,642
My God, this is just like
a maze of raw data.

513
00:17:59,644 --> 00:18:00,977
Can you make any sense of it?

514
00:18:00,979 --> 00:18:02,445
Yeah, I already have.

515
00:18:02,447 --> 00:18:04,848
Look at this.

516
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:06,149
See?

517
00:18:06,151 --> 00:18:07,851
He's setting up this patsy
to take the fall.

518
00:18:07,853 --> 00:18:10,186
He's not even gonna see it
coming, what a "smuck."

519
00:18:10,188 --> 00:18:12,122
I'm sorry, did...
did you just say,

520
00:18:12,124 --> 00:18:13,656
what a "smuck?"

521
00:18:13,658 --> 00:18:16,993
No, I said what a "smuck."

522
00:18:16,995 --> 00:18:18,094
You mean schmuck.

523
00:18:18,096 --> 00:18:19,662
Huh?

524
00:18:19,664 --> 00:18:20,997
You know a schmuck, right?

525
00:18:20,999 --> 00:18:22,031
"Smuck."

526
00:18:34,345 --> 00:18:35,478
Monica?

527
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,913
Mike Ross.

528
00:18:36,915 --> 00:18:38,047
Can I join you?

529
00:18:38,049 --> 00:18:40,350
Chair's empty.

530
00:18:40,352 --> 00:18:41,684
I appreciate it.

531
00:18:41,686 --> 00:18:44,988
Rachel said this was about
one of my old cases?

532
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:47,791
This is a lawsuit that we just
drew up in your name,

533
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:51,394
seeking $10 million in damages
from Pearson Hardman.

534
00:18:51,396 --> 00:18:52,529
Should have seen this coming.

535
00:18:52,531 --> 00:18:54,597
Five years ago you got screwed.

536
00:18:54,599 --> 00:18:55,832
One way to put it.

537
00:18:55,834 --> 00:18:57,600
You had options
you didn't explore.

538
00:18:57,602 --> 00:18:58,968
And you're
exploring them for me.

539
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:01,871
I can make what stopped you
before go away, yes.

540
00:19:01,873 --> 00:19:05,542
Harvey will back your claim.

541
00:19:05,544 --> 00:19:06,576
What about Jessica?

542
00:19:06,578 --> 00:19:08,845
You don't need Jessica.

543
00:19:08,847 --> 00:19:11,981
Why are you doing this?

544
00:19:11,983 --> 00:19:14,517
Does it matter?

545
00:19:14,519 --> 00:19:16,986
No. It doesn't.

546
00:19:16,988 --> 00:19:19,956
I don't want anything
to do with this.

547
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:23,893
Last five years haven't been
easy for you, have they?

548
00:19:23,895 --> 00:19:26,029
You don't know
anything about me.

549
00:19:26,031 --> 00:19:27,797
I know you've been
working retail.

550
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:29,966
It's a boutique
on Park Avenue, right?

551
00:19:29,968 --> 00:19:32,902
It's a good job, you're making
what, maybe 40 grand a year?

552
00:19:32,904 --> 00:19:34,204
This is Manhattan.

553
00:19:34,206 --> 00:19:36,739
What, are you covering rent
with that?

554
00:19:36,741 --> 00:19:39,042
So you're the new attack dog.

555
00:19:39,044 --> 00:19:41,578
Well, Spot,
I'm not revisiting a story

556
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:44,881
I spent the last five years
trying to forget.

557
00:19:44,883 --> 00:19:47,350
Just take it with you.

558
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:49,118
You may change your mind.

559
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,621
And if you call me,
I'll come fetch.

560
00:20:01,866 --> 00:20:03,967
- It's Daniel Hardman.
- What?

561
00:20:03,969 --> 00:20:05,435
He's been playing a shell game.

562
00:20:05,437 --> 00:20:08,238
He's moving money out of one
account and into another.

563
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,672
For an entire year.

564
00:20:09,674 --> 00:20:11,174
Your partner sold you out.

565
00:20:11,176 --> 00:20:13,376
Daniel has never done
anything unethical.

566
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:14,677
And the fact that
you don't like him...

567
00:20:14,679 --> 00:20:16,913
I know, isn't reason
to falsely accuse him.

568
00:20:16,915 --> 00:20:18,748
I'm not.

569
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:21,618
You falsely accused Louis.

570
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:23,419
I stake my career on this.

571
00:20:23,421 --> 00:20:26,222
You are.

572
00:20:26,224 --> 00:20:27,624
He did it.

573
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:39,135
Shit.

574
00:20:39,137 --> 00:20:40,803
He did.

575
00:20:40,805 --> 00:20:43,840
You have to go to the D.A.

576
00:20:43,842 --> 00:20:46,776
I'm going to Daniel.

577
00:20:46,778 --> 00:20:48,978
Who's not doing their job
like a man now?

578
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:51,080
I'm giving him the courtesy
of explaining himself.

579
00:20:51,082 --> 00:20:54,050
You shouldn't.

580
00:20:54,052 --> 00:20:55,852
What you do if it were me?

581
00:21:36,286 --> 00:21:37,419
[Knocking door ]

582
00:21:39,535 --> 00:21:40,767
- Hi.
- Hey.

583
00:21:40,769 --> 00:21:43,103
- Come in.
- Oh. Thanks.

584
00:21:43,105 --> 00:21:46,039
Oh...

585
00:21:46,041 --> 00:21:47,674
Are those for me, probably?

586
00:21:47,676 --> 00:21:48,942
Yeah. That's a thing, right?

587
00:21:48,944 --> 00:21:50,210
Uh, bringing flowers
for the roommate of

588
00:21:50,212 --> 00:21:51,645
the girl you're taking...

589
00:21:51,647 --> 00:21:55,082
you're just gonna take
one of those, okay.

590
00:21:55,084 --> 00:21:57,451
Who's gonna tell her?
You? Lieutenant Weinberg?

591
00:21:57,453 --> 00:21:58,619
That's from.

592
00:21:58,621 --> 00:21:59,953
- <i>A Few Good Men.</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

593
00:21:59,955 --> 00:22:03,123
Yeah. I get HBO.

594
00:22:03,125 --> 00:22:04,358
[Mouthing words] I love you!

595
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:07,011
Uh, Nikki is gonna be out
any minute, so...

596
00:22:07,036 --> 00:22:09,341
Am I dressed okay, for her?

597
00:22:09,665 --> 00:22:12,599
[mouthing words]
Yeah, uh, you look fine.

598
00:22:12,601 --> 00:22:13,867
- Good?
- Yeah.

599
00:22:13,869 --> 00:22:15,669
Would... can you me the truth?

600
00:22:15,671 --> 00:22:17,504
You don't want the truth.

601
00:22:17,506 --> 00:22:19,039
"'Cause deep down
in places you don't

602
00:22:19,041 --> 00:22:20,674
[together] "talk about at
parties, you want me"

603
00:22:20,676 --> 00:22:23,043
"on that wall,
you <i>need</i> me on that wall..."

604
00:22:23,045 --> 00:22:24,745
Hey, Nikki.

605
00:22:24,747 --> 00:22:27,080
Hi.

606
00:22:27,082 --> 00:22:29,082
Uh, wow.

607
00:22:29,084 --> 00:22:32,152
Those look beautiful.

608
00:22:32,154 --> 00:22:33,453
Ohuh, yeah... um,

609
00:22:33,455 --> 00:22:35,255
so... so, do you.

610
00:22:35,257 --> 00:22:36,757
So they-I'm gonna go

611
00:22:36,759 --> 00:22:38,243
put these in water. Okay.

612
00:22:38,244 --> 00:22:39,560
[Whispering] You liar.

613
00:22:39,561 --> 00:22:40,925
Look at her.

614
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:42,950
You did want to look perfect
on your first date.

615
00:22:42,959 --> 00:22:44,992
Yeah, I do.

616
00:22:45,534 --> 00:22:46,633
Ready?

617
00:22:46,635 --> 00:22:48,302
Yeah, I'm ready. Are...

618
00:22:48,304 --> 00:22:49,369
- are you ready?
- Yeah.

619
00:22:49,371 --> 00:22:51,171
Then we, ready.

620
00:22:51,173 --> 00:22:52,539
For dinner. Everyone's ready,

621
00:22:52,541 --> 00:22:53,707
- isn't that great?
- Good Night.

622
00:22:53,709 --> 00:22:55,642
That great?

623
00:23:03,284 --> 00:23:04,551
Something I can help you with?

624
00:23:04,553 --> 00:23:05,719
Yon help me understand why

625
00:23:05,721 --> 00:23:09,022
you've been stealing
from our clients.

626
00:23:09,024 --> 00:23:10,090
Jessica, I can...

627
00:23:10,092 --> 00:23:13,093
Oh, God damn Daniel.

628
00:23:14,919 --> 00:23:16,804
It was for Alicia.

629
00:23:16,829 --> 00:23:18,259
She's dying.

630
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:22,364
What?

631
00:23:22,475 --> 00:23:25,243
Breast cancer.

632
00:23:25,245 --> 00:23:27,078
Stage four.

633
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:29,881
Why didn't you say anything?

634
00:23:29,883 --> 00:23:31,582
She found a lump a year ago.

635
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:33,694
It was the worst day
of our lives.

636
00:23:36,147 --> 00:23:38,111
I have no words.

637
00:23:40,026 --> 00:23:42,193
I thought I could
handle it myself.

638
00:23:45,163 --> 00:23:47,498
And the money?

639
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,534
Treatments.
Not covered by insurance.

640
00:23:49,536 --> 00:23:50,635
Why not?

641
00:23:50,637 --> 00:23:52,537
They're not in the books.

642
00:23:52,539 --> 00:23:54,138
But I don't care.

643
00:23:54,163 --> 00:23:56,252
She's not dying because
I didn't spend the money.

644
00:23:57,944 --> 00:24:02,547
You stole $1/2 million.

645
00:24:02,549 --> 00:24:06,651
I don't expect you
to forgive me.

646
00:24:06,653 --> 00:24:10,221
What do you expect?

647
00:24:10,223 --> 00:24:13,724
I honestly don't know.

648
00:24:18,237 --> 00:24:20,512
Wild Maine salmon,
braised fennel

649
00:24:20,526 --> 00:24:23,394
mushroom polenta,
arugula salad,

650
00:24:23,396 --> 00:24:25,791
and do you really need
to keep doing this?

651
00:24:25,796 --> 00:24:27,462
U really are a genius.

652
00:24:27,464 --> 00:24:28,897
Sexy, right?

653
00:24:28,899 --> 00:24:31,066
What'd you get on your SATs?

654
00:24:31,068 --> 00:24:32,887
Ooh, 1590.

655
00:24:33,096 --> 00:24:34,635
Yeah, it was an ambiguous
question, I don't know.

656
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:36,278
I really don't like
to talk about it.

657
00:24:37,271 --> 00:24:38,837
Oh, no, no, no.
Here, let me get that,

658
00:24:38,839 --> 00:24:40,706
c'mon. Parents' plastic.

659
00:24:40,708 --> 00:24:41,774
They're cool.

660
00:24:41,776 --> 00:24:43,108
Cool.

661
00:24:47,781 --> 00:24:49,408
Listen, um...

662
00:24:50,723 --> 00:24:52,134
Why don't we go back
to your place, cause

663
00:24:52,353 --> 00:24:53,852
I'm live in Brooklyn,
and I kinda in

664
00:24:53,854 --> 00:24:55,154
a strange roommate situation...

665
00:24:55,156 --> 00:24:57,256
I want to pay you $1000

666
00:24:57,258 --> 00:24:59,858
to take the LSATs for me.

667
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:01,894
Oh.

668
00:25:01,896 --> 00:25:04,063
What?

669
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:11,603
That's why you snaked me
from Jenny.

670
00:25:11,605 --> 00:25:12,738
I don't know what you're

671
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:14,606
talking about. Unbelievable.

672
00:25:14,608 --> 00:25:16,809
We're not all born geniuses.

673
00:25:16,811 --> 00:25:17,910
And I need your help.

674
00:25:17,912 --> 00:25:19,745
Yeah, you might not
be a genius,

675
00:25:19,747 --> 00:25:21,747
but you know exactly
what you're doing.

676
00:25:25,352 --> 00:25:28,053
And you're not getting my help.

677
00:25:28,055 --> 00:25:31,123
Come on.

678
00:25:31,125 --> 00:25:32,558
What do you want?

679
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,026
Oh, I don't want anything.

680
00:25:34,028 --> 00:25:36,729
Because I'm not
your trained monkey.

681
00:25:36,731 --> 00:25:38,464
Tell your mommy thanks
for dinner.

682
00:25:38,466 --> 00:25:41,767
Grammy!

683
00:25:41,769 --> 00:25:43,235
Oh my God, what's the matter?

684
00:25:43,237 --> 00:25:44,770
Bob, what happened?
Relax, Mike.

685
00:25:44,772 --> 00:25:46,972
Edith's fine, I'm just gonna
go get her a glass of water.

686
00:25:46,974 --> 00:25:48,674
Grammy, here, look at me.
What happened?

687
00:25:48,676 --> 00:25:50,275
I don't know.
I think the floor was wet.

688
00:25:50,277 --> 00:25:52,044
The floor was wet,
how did the floor get wet?

689
00:25:52,046 --> 00:25:53,846
Well, it happened fast.

690
00:25:53,848 --> 00:25:55,214
But I'm okay.

691
00:25:55,216 --> 00:25:57,416
But, what are you doing here?

692
00:25:57,418 --> 00:25:59,752
I thought you had a date.

693
00:25:59,754 --> 00:26:03,789
Uh, it di...
no, it didn't work out.

694
00:26:03,791 --> 00:26:05,824
So, you came to see
your grandmother.

695
00:26:05,826 --> 00:26:07,493
That's not normal, Michael.

696
00:26:07,495 --> 00:26:09,395
Rea... are we gonna do this,
right now?

697
00:26:09,397 --> 00:26:10,496
- Hey.
- Thank you, Bob,

698
00:26:10,498 --> 00:26:11,864
I really appreciate it.

699
00:26:11,866 --> 00:26:14,733
That's what neighbors are for.

700
00:26:14,735 --> 00:26:16,335
Here, you drink that,
and we'll be right back.

701
00:26:16,337 --> 00:26:18,570
Okay?

702
00:26:18,572 --> 00:26:20,739
- For what it's worth...
- Uh-huh.

703
00:26:20,741 --> 00:26:22,608
[Whispering] The floor wasn't
wet.

704
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:25,611
You know, if I were you, I'd get
full-time care for Edith.

705
00:26:32,018 --> 00:26:34,620
- Are you crazy?
- Did you hear me?

706
00:26:34,622 --> 00:26:36,855
His wife's dying of cancer.

707
00:26:36,857 --> 00:26:38,257
So you're going to
let him walk?

708
00:26:38,259 --> 00:26:39,658
No, nobody's walking.

709
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:41,727
The firm's taking out a loan
against its assets.

710
00:26:41,729 --> 00:26:43,062
Daniel will pay it back.

711
00:26:43,064 --> 00:26:45,330
Great. My dad has gout,
can I have $1 million?

712
00:26:45,332 --> 00:26:46,832
Coldhearted son of a bitch.

713
00:26:46,834 --> 00:26:50,302
You know those Tuesday lunches
at the Harvard Club?

714
00:26:50,304 --> 00:26:51,937
He's taking Alicia to chemo.

715
00:26:51,939 --> 00:26:53,705
He stole from our clients,

716
00:26:53,707 --> 00:26:55,140
which means he's stealing
from us.

717
00:26:55,142 --> 00:26:57,376
When it was Louis,
you were ready to break him down

718
00:26:57,378 --> 00:26:58,510
and crack him open.

719
00:26:58,512 --> 00:27:00,646
Daniel is the reason
why I'm here.

720
00:27:00,648 --> 00:27:01,980
He plucked me from the bullpen

721
00:27:01,982 --> 00:27:03,515
when I didn't know my ass
from my elbow.

722
00:27:03,517 --> 00:27:05,584
He saw a star
to hitch his wagon to.

723
00:27:05,586 --> 00:27:08,220
This is Manhattan, Harvey.

724
00:27:08,222 --> 00:27:11,523
How many black women do you see
with their name on the door?

725
00:27:11,525 --> 00:27:13,125
You know what, he was smart
to put your name first.

726
00:27:13,127 --> 00:27:15,661
That way you might not notice
that you'd always be number two.

727
00:27:15,663 --> 00:27:17,296
- Careful, Harvey.
- Then again,

728
00:27:17,298 --> 00:27:19,498
maybe you're okay staying
number two... Scottie Pippen...

729
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:20,632
Don't pull that shit on me.

730
00:27:20,634 --> 00:27:23,469
We made a deal,
and I honored it.

731
00:27:23,471 --> 00:27:27,206
It's time for you to honor it.

732
00:27:27,208 --> 00:27:30,442
Wow, a man's wife's dying,

733
00:27:30,444 --> 00:27:34,546
and the first words out
of your mouth are "you owe me."

734
00:27:34,548 --> 00:27:35,981
Who's the bad guy now?

735
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:57,542
[Clears throat]

736
00:27:57,639 --> 00:27:59,657
You asked me what
it's gonna take.

737
00:27:59,724 --> 00:28:01,190
It's gonna take $5,000.

738
00:28:01,192 --> 00:28:03,960
- Keep your voice down.
- Why, am I making you nervous?

739
00:28:03,962 --> 00:28:05,495
Yes.

740
00:28:05,497 --> 00:28:08,264
Good. Now you know
how I'm gonna feel.

741
00:28:08,266 --> 00:28:10,099
You're asking me
to expose myself

742
00:28:10,101 --> 00:28:11,501
so that you can go
make a fortune.

743
00:28:11,503 --> 00:28:12,902
So either you figure out
how to pay me,

744
00:28:12,904 --> 00:28:14,671
or you roll the dice
on your own.

745
00:28:14,673 --> 00:28:17,507
But trust me when I tell you,
these tests aren't easy.

746
00:28:17,509 --> 00:28:20,877
Well, they are for me.

747
00:28:20,879 --> 00:28:23,046
Okay.

748
00:28:23,048 --> 00:28:25,415
Good.

749
00:28:25,417 --> 00:28:29,018
What made you change your mind?

750
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:31,521
None of your business.

751
00:28:35,659 --> 00:28:37,427
- You're not Monica.
- Oh, no, I'm...

752
00:28:37,429 --> 00:28:39,429
- Rachel Zane.
- How did you know that?

753
00:28:39,431 --> 00:28:40,763
I'm Donna. I know everything.

754
00:28:40,765 --> 00:28:43,166
- Everything?
- You started three months ago,

755
00:28:43,168 --> 00:28:44,534
you have a peach yogurt
every morning,

756
00:28:44,536 --> 00:28:45,935
you've got a cute pair
of suede pumps

757
00:28:45,937 --> 00:28:47,704
I totally plan on stealing,

758
00:28:47,706 --> 00:28:49,005
and your father's Robert Zane,

759
00:28:49,007 --> 00:28:52,308
name partner at Rand,
Kaldor, and Zane.

760
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:55,078
And, apparently, you don't like
people knowing who your dad is.

761
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:57,347
Well, they just...
they treat you differently.

762
00:28:57,349 --> 00:28:59,182
Your secret's safe with me.

763
00:28:59,184 --> 00:29:00,883
No, it doesn't really matter.

764
00:29:00,885 --> 00:29:03,052
I won't be here that long.
It is the cafeteria?

765
00:29:03,054 --> 00:29:05,054
Because it is <i>way</i> better
than it used to be.

766
00:29:05,056 --> 00:29:07,023
Nope.
I live for foie gras Fridays.

767
00:29:07,025 --> 00:29:10,293
- They don't have that.
- Don't they?

768
00:29:10,295 --> 00:29:13,129
You're weird. We'll be friends.

769
00:29:13,131 --> 00:29:14,897
Anyway, I should go.

770
00:29:14,899 --> 00:29:16,466
I'm just gonna leave
this stuff here for Monica.

771
00:29:16,468 --> 00:29:17,667
She should be back pretty soon.

772
00:29:17,669 --> 00:29:20,403
She just has Tuesday pilates
at Chelsea Pier.

773
00:29:20,405 --> 00:29:22,639
Every Tuesday?

774
00:29:22,641 --> 00:29:26,909
Now, I thought
you knew everything.

775
00:29:26,911 --> 00:29:28,444
I do.

776
00:29:35,786 --> 00:29:38,488
What are you so bouncy about?

777
00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:43,459
You're gonna be so happy
that I listen to your intercom.

778
00:29:43,461 --> 00:29:46,229
[Doorbell rings]

779
00:29:46,231 --> 00:29:47,497
Who is it?

780
00:29:47,499 --> 00:29:50,566
Room service.

781
00:29:50,568 --> 00:29:52,735
What are you doing here?

782
00:29:52,737 --> 00:29:55,371
Delivering champagne.
I see you can afford it

783
00:29:55,373 --> 00:29:57,106
since the money you've been
stealing from our clients

784
00:29:57,108 --> 00:29:59,509
hasn't been going to
your wife's cancer treatments.

785
00:29:59,511 --> 00:30:00,710
Hey, Monica, how's it going?

786
00:30:00,712 --> 00:30:04,647
- Harvey.
- Daniel and I need a minute.

787
00:30:04,649 --> 00:30:07,750
Letter of resignation.

788
00:30:07,752 --> 00:30:09,385
You're gonna sign it,

789
00:30:09,387 --> 00:30:11,454
and then name Jessica
as your successor.

790
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:12,755
I don't think so.

791
00:30:12,757 --> 00:30:14,824
Unflinching in the face
of defeat.

792
00:30:14,826 --> 00:30:16,092
It's not defeat.

793
00:30:16,094 --> 00:30:17,927
You come after me
for embezzlement,

794
00:30:17,929 --> 00:30:20,963
every Pearson Hardman client
you've got is gone.

795
00:30:20,965 --> 00:30:23,800
Which is why Jessica
won't let me do that.

796
00:30:23,802 --> 00:30:25,535
Then why are you here?

797
00:30:25,537 --> 00:30:26,869
Waiting for your wife.

798
00:30:26,871 --> 00:30:28,471
What are you talking about?

799
00:30:28,473 --> 00:30:29,806
She's invited to a fund raiser.

800
00:30:29,808 --> 00:30:31,974
She'll be at the front desk
in three minutes.

801
00:30:31,976 --> 00:30:34,444
You don't sign, they'll send her
up to this room.

802
00:30:34,446 --> 00:30:36,345
You do sign, they'll send her
to another room.

803
00:30:36,347 --> 00:30:38,981
You dragged a woman
racked with cancer here

804
00:30:38,983 --> 00:30:40,383
to blackmail me?

805
00:30:40,385 --> 00:30:44,721
You think it's me
she's gonna have issue with?

806
00:30:44,723 --> 00:30:45,988
You goddamn bastard.

807
00:30:45,990 --> 00:30:48,191
Says the man cheating
on his dying wife.

808
00:30:48,193 --> 00:30:51,961
- You don't know anything.
- I do.

809
00:30:51,963 --> 00:30:54,897
I've seen you with her,
and I know you love her.

810
00:30:54,899 --> 00:30:57,500
And this has nothing to do
with that.

811
00:30:57,502 --> 00:31:00,336
I also know that you don't want
the rest of Alicia's life

812
00:31:00,338 --> 00:31:02,171
spent picturing this.

813
00:31:02,173 --> 00:31:04,907
If she wasn't sick,
she could probably get over it.

814
00:31:04,909 --> 00:31:08,878
She's not getting
any better, Daniel.

815
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,481
You have two minutes.

816
00:31:11,483 --> 00:31:15,485
It's your call.

817
00:31:17,721 --> 00:31:19,288
[Knock on door]

818
00:31:25,362 --> 00:31:27,497
There's something
I think you should know.

819
00:31:27,499 --> 00:31:30,733
Please.

820
00:31:30,735 --> 00:31:33,269
Mike Ross had lunch
with Monica Eton today.

821
00:31:33,271 --> 00:31:35,938
I saw him hand her a filing.

822
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:38,040
And why do you think
this concerns me?

823
00:31:38,042 --> 00:31:39,342
I just think that their meeting

824
00:31:39,344 --> 00:31:40,643
on the eve
of the firm's vote suggests

825
00:31:40,645 --> 00:31:42,712
that Jessica's making a move.

826
00:31:42,714 --> 00:31:45,815
You've been good to me
since you've been back.

827
00:31:48,552 --> 00:31:52,221
She hasn't.

828
00:31:52,223 --> 00:31:54,957
Do what you will.

829
00:32:05,536 --> 00:32:08,137
About time.
I wasn't sure you'd make it.

830
00:32:08,139 --> 00:32:09,872
Especially since
you didn't give me a reason.

831
00:32:09,874 --> 00:32:13,943
I've got about 5,000 reasons.

832
00:32:13,945 --> 00:32:16,646
We'll be fine.

833
00:32:16,648 --> 00:32:18,381
Oh, my God, you're high.

834
00:32:18,383 --> 00:32:20,817
- I'm fine.
- Are you crazy?

835
00:32:20,819 --> 00:32:22,251
I'm about to do
something illegal, okay?

836
00:32:22,253 --> 00:32:24,320
It helps calm me down.
Great, you'll be calm.

837
00:32:24,322 --> 00:32:26,422
How the hell are you gonna
handle the test?

838
00:32:26,424 --> 00:32:27,423
I don't know,
maybe the same way I handled

839
00:32:27,425 --> 00:32:28,491
your little quiz
the other night.

840
00:32:28,493 --> 00:32:30,927
- You were high.
- And drunk.

841
00:32:30,929 --> 00:32:33,462
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I've got a test to take.

842
00:32:33,464 --> 00:32:35,565
And I've gotta miss a couple
of questions on purpose.

843
00:33:08,465 --> 00:33:11,467
It's done. Hardman's gone.

844
00:33:14,705 --> 00:33:17,240
Harvey...

845
00:33:17,242 --> 00:33:20,343
What is it?

846
00:33:20,345 --> 00:33:23,813
I don't know how to say this.

847
00:33:23,815 --> 00:33:26,048
Just say it, Donna. What?

848
00:33:26,050 --> 00:33:31,988
Your dad...
he had a heart attack.

849
00:33:46,103 --> 00:33:49,005
Harvey, I'm so sorry.

850
00:33:52,743 --> 00:33:54,710
It's okay.

851
00:33:54,712 --> 00:33:56,512
[Quietly, voice quivering]
Oh, my God.

852
00:34:15,889 --> 00:34:18,558
- Good morning, Monica.
- Jessica.

853
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,893
You look tired. Did you get
much rest last night?

854
00:34:20,895 --> 00:34:23,529
- I want to explain.
- I'm not here for excuses.

855
00:34:23,531 --> 00:34:25,064
Then why are you here?

856
00:34:25,066 --> 00:34:27,567
- To see you off.
- My relationship with Daniel

857
00:34:27,569 --> 00:34:29,769
has nothing to do
with my work here.

858
00:34:29,771 --> 00:34:32,471
I need to know
I can trust my people.

859
00:34:32,473 --> 00:34:34,273
You're not my people.

860
00:34:34,275 --> 00:34:36,475
You can't fire me.

861
00:34:36,477 --> 00:34:37,944
I'll sue for wrongful
termination.

862
00:34:37,946 --> 00:34:39,512
Which will lead me
to implicate you

863
00:34:39,514 --> 00:34:40,880
in Daniel's crimes.

864
00:34:40,882 --> 00:34:43,716
- I had nothing to do with that.
- Didn't you?

865
00:34:43,718 --> 00:34:47,186
Diamond earrings,
diamond bracelet,

866
00:34:47,188 --> 00:34:52,058
and trips to, let's see now...

867
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:56,996
Mexico... France... Hong Kong.

868
00:34:56,998 --> 00:34:58,564
Hope you liked that one.

869
00:34:58,566 --> 00:35:00,666
- I didn't know.
- I don't care.

870
00:35:00,668 --> 00:35:03,135
You are
a Harvard-educated lawyer.

871
00:35:03,137 --> 00:35:04,670
Do you think that a jury
will believe

872
00:35:04,672 --> 00:35:08,441
you had no idea
where that money came from?

873
00:35:08,443 --> 00:35:11,544
Don't do this.

874
00:35:11,546 --> 00:35:14,580
Louis will accept
your resignation,

875
00:35:14,582 --> 00:35:18,417
and I will never
see you here again.

876
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:27,126
I expected a fight,
but not a dirty one.

877
00:35:27,128 --> 00:35:28,227
I don't know what
you're talking about.

878
00:35:28,229 --> 00:35:30,196
Mike Ross met with Monica Eton.

879
00:35:30,198 --> 00:35:31,564
And what does that have
to do with me?

880
00:35:31,566 --> 00:35:33,866
I am disappointed that
you felt the need to go there.

881
00:35:33,868 --> 00:35:35,601
I'm disappointed
you think I did.

882
00:35:35,603 --> 00:35:38,204
You really expect me
to believe that you didn't...

883
00:35:38,206 --> 00:35:39,472
Stop right there!

884
00:35:39,474 --> 00:35:41,173
You know,
you might fight dirty,

885
00:35:41,175 --> 00:35:43,776
and Harvey might fight dirty,
but I don't.

886
00:35:45,445 --> 00:35:47,413
What the hell are you doing?

887
00:35:47,415 --> 00:35:50,016
Trying to get Monica Eton to
file a sexual harassment suit

888
00:35:50,018 --> 00:35:51,350
against Daniel Hardman?

889
00:35:51,352 --> 00:35:52,818
Okay she left because
of their affair,

890
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:55,087
which he paid for
with embezzled money.

891
00:35:55,089 --> 00:35:57,790
- That was five years ago.
- And her life fell apart!

892
00:35:57,792 --> 00:35:58,958
I know you think
you're trying to help me,

893
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:01,293
but drop it, immediately.

894
00:36:04,965 --> 00:36:07,767
Wow. That's what
all this was about?

895
00:36:07,769 --> 00:36:09,301
Nice performance.

896
00:36:09,303 --> 00:36:10,469
I'm trying to help Jessica.

897
00:36:10,471 --> 00:36:11,771
Mike, you cannot
keep me in the dark.

898
00:36:11,773 --> 00:36:13,172
Not when you're the one
asking me for help.

899
00:36:13,174 --> 00:36:14,740
Couldn't take the chance
that you wouldn't help.

900
00:36:14,742 --> 00:36:16,308
You told me it was about
one of Monica's old cases.

901
00:36:16,310 --> 00:36:17,743
You lied like it's
second nature.

902
00:36:17,745 --> 00:36:19,478
Our backs are against the wall.

903
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:21,480
I did what I had to do.
And you're proud of that?

904
00:36:21,482 --> 00:36:22,982
Rachel, sometimes
you have to cross a line

905
00:36:22,984 --> 00:36:25,184
to do the right thing. Wow...

906
00:36:25,186 --> 00:36:28,621
Harvey has really
rubbed off on you.

907
00:36:28,623 --> 00:36:31,924
I didn't learn that
from Harvey.

908
00:36:31,926 --> 00:36:34,460
Heh.

909
00:36:34,462 --> 00:36:36,729
Holy shit, dude.

910
00:36:36,731 --> 00:36:38,130
Pays to be a nerd.

911
00:36:38,132 --> 00:36:40,633
Yeah, but you still
don't get the girls.

912
00:36:40,635 --> 00:36:41,701
I don't know,
I guess I'm gonna use this

913
00:36:41,703 --> 00:36:43,602
to get my grandma some help.

914
00:36:43,604 --> 00:36:45,337
Too bad it was
a one-time-only deal.

915
00:36:45,339 --> 00:36:46,472
Actually, she has three friends

916
00:36:46,474 --> 00:36:48,374
who want to use
my services, so...

917
00:36:48,376 --> 00:36:50,009
- Oh, good.
- We're in business.

918
00:36:50,011 --> 00:36:51,010
'Cause you're gonna need
to start paying

919
00:36:51,012 --> 00:36:54,213
all the rent around here.

920
00:36:54,215 --> 00:36:55,648
What?

921
00:36:55,650 --> 00:36:56,949
Oh, did you think
you were the only one

922
00:36:56,951 --> 00:36:58,050
stepping up his game?

923
00:36:58,052 --> 00:37:00,486
Meaning?

924
00:37:00,488 --> 00:37:01,987
[Chuckles]

925
00:37:07,928 --> 00:37:10,229
What? Trevor, no, no, no.
Not a good idea.

926
00:37:10,231 --> 00:37:12,498
No.
Which is why I'm moving out.

927
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:14,200
Unless you want in,
in which case,

928
00:37:14,202 --> 00:37:15,801
you know, I'm still moving out.

929
00:37:15,803 --> 00:37:17,002
But we could go together...

930
00:37:17,004 --> 00:37:19,205
move into a much,
much nicer apartment.

931
00:37:19,207 --> 00:37:21,073
[Knock on door] That's Jenny.

932
00:37:21,075 --> 00:37:22,575
First date.

933
00:37:22,577 --> 00:37:23,943
Could you not tell her
about this?

934
00:37:23,945 --> 00:37:25,578
Go get the door.

935
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:27,246
Unbelievable.

936
00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:31,684
[Sighs] Jenny.

937
00:37:31,686 --> 00:37:33,552
Aren't you a sight
for sore eyes.

938
00:37:38,759 --> 00:37:41,761
Daniel came in last night
to pick up his things.

939
00:37:41,763 --> 00:37:42,962
Threw a phone at my head.

940
00:37:42,964 --> 00:37:44,964
You duck,
or is his aim that bad?

941
00:37:44,966 --> 00:37:47,566
- He throws like a girl.
- I'm not surprised.

942
00:37:47,568 --> 00:37:48,901
You needed me?

943
00:37:48,903 --> 00:37:50,102
I wanted you to be
the first to know.

944
00:37:50,104 --> 00:37:51,637
We have a new partner.

945
00:37:51,639 --> 00:37:54,240
Andrew McCutcheon.
Solid candidate.

946
00:37:54,242 --> 00:37:56,475
A simple thank you
would suffice.

947
00:37:56,477 --> 00:37:59,245
Me thank you? Never.

948
00:37:59,247 --> 00:38:01,180
Well, I have a partners
meeting in five minutes.

949
00:38:01,182 --> 00:38:05,985
I'm gonna break the news
that I'm taking Daniel's office.

950
00:38:05,987 --> 00:38:08,788
- Who's taking yours?
- I'm looking at him.

951
00:38:12,025 --> 00:38:14,293
Jessica...

952
00:38:14,295 --> 00:38:17,930
Thank you.

953
00:38:17,932 --> 00:38:19,265
One last tip.

954
00:38:19,267 --> 00:38:23,135
Don't let Louis in here
after hours.

955
00:38:38,618 --> 00:38:40,953
Finally an office big enough
for your balls.

956
00:38:40,955 --> 00:38:43,022
Okay, I am not touching
that one.

957
00:38:43,024 --> 00:38:44,523
You would if you had
bigger balls.

958
00:38:44,525 --> 00:38:47,593
Hold on a sec, did you listen
on Jessica's intercom?

959
00:38:47,595 --> 00:38:49,628
- No. She told me.
- Before me?

960
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:51,730
Well, I was the one
to figure it out about Daniel.

961
00:38:51,732 --> 00:38:52,998
Oh, and how did she know that?

962
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:58,137
Let's just focus
on what's important.

963
00:38:58,139 --> 00:39:00,873
You just made partner.

964
00:39:00,875 --> 00:39:04,543
We just made partner.

965
00:39:04,545 --> 00:39:06,512
I'll grab the can opener.

966
00:39:06,514 --> 00:39:08,180
Whoa, whoa,
that's pre-trial ritual.

967
00:39:08,182 --> 00:39:10,649
We're making an exception.

968
00:39:10,651 --> 00:39:12,518
- I'll get the thumbtacks.
- Two dozen?

969
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:14,553
- Three dozen.
- Ooh, going for the record!

970
00:39:18,892 --> 00:39:20,960
- Zoe.
- Harvey.

971
00:39:20,962 --> 00:39:22,294
Is word out already?

972
00:39:22,296 --> 00:39:23,796
Word about what?

973
00:39:23,798 --> 00:39:25,731
Oh, don't be coy.
I just made partner.

974
00:39:25,733 --> 00:39:27,233
You're here to congratulate me.

975
00:39:27,235 --> 00:39:31,637
I knew it.
It was Hardman, wasn't it?

976
00:39:33,673 --> 00:39:35,174
What do you want me to say?

977
00:39:35,176 --> 00:39:39,378
Nothing.

978
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:41,080
I know how it is around here.

979
00:39:41,082 --> 00:39:43,349
Secrets and lies...
standard procedure.

980
00:39:43,351 --> 00:39:44,884
I didn't build
the sandbox, Zoe.

981
00:39:44,886 --> 00:39:46,719
No, you just like
to play in it.

982
00:39:46,721 --> 00:39:48,487
- And you don't?
- No.

983
00:39:48,489 --> 00:39:49,889
And I don't like watching
what it's doing

984
00:39:49,891 --> 00:39:51,257
to a man I care about.

985
00:39:51,259 --> 00:39:53,659
- Zoe...
- I'm leaving.

986
00:39:53,661 --> 00:39:55,828
Today's my last day.
Because of this?

987
00:39:55,830 --> 00:39:57,563
Look, I did what I did
for the good of the firm.

988
00:39:57,565 --> 00:40:00,199
You think that's
what I'm talking about?

989
00:40:00,201 --> 00:40:02,334
Do you know what this is?

990
00:40:02,336 --> 00:40:05,104
It's my condolences,

991
00:40:05,106 --> 00:40:07,740
which I expected to leave
on your desk,

992
00:40:07,742 --> 00:40:09,675
because I thought you'd be out
mourning your father.

993
00:40:09,677 --> 00:40:11,744
- I had...
- What, bigger fish to fry?

994
00:40:11,746 --> 00:40:13,879
Don't you see?
That's what this place does.

995
00:40:13,881 --> 00:40:15,714
There's always bigger fish.

996
00:40:15,716 --> 00:40:19,585
I am dealing how I deal.

997
00:40:19,587 --> 00:40:21,353
Harvey, you've lost your way.

998
00:41:48,241 --> 00:41:50,242
How'd it go yesterday?

999
00:41:50,244 --> 00:41:52,578
Fine. Mike pull it off?

1000
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:54,680
- Yep.
- He suspect you were in on it?

1001
00:41:54,682 --> 00:41:56,982
- Nope.
- Well, now they know.

1002
00:41:56,984 --> 00:41:58,450
Gonna swing us some votes.

1003
00:41:58,452 --> 00:42:00,753
We threw Daniel's ass out
once, we'll do it again.

1004
00:42:00,755 --> 00:42:04,523
- Damn right.
- One more thing.

1005
00:42:04,525 --> 00:42:06,759
I'm getting Donna back.
