1
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:20,732
- There you go.
- Thank the Lord.

2
00:00:20,812 --> 00:00:22,402
Home sweet home.

3
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,070
For the love of Pete,
what have you got in here?

4
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:27,490
I told you I could carry my own damn bag.

5
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:31,278
So, thank you for accompanying me home.

6
00:00:31,364 --> 00:00:33,744
Now, please feel free
to go about your business.

7
00:00:34,075 --> 00:00:34,905
Hope.

8
00:00:34,993 --> 00:00:37,043
The doctors released me. So can you.

9
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,420
Hell, I... I still think
it was just indigestion.

10
00:00:40,498 --> 00:00:42,628
Okay, well,
your EKG and blood work would disagree.

11
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:44,169
That's just junk science.

12
00:00:44,252 --> 00:00:47,302
Hope, three days ago
you had a heart attack.

13
00:00:47,839 --> 00:00:50,549
Has that sunk in yet? Because it needs to.

14
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,930
I mean, it was mild, but you're gonna need
to make some lifestyle changes.

15
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:56,643
Help me out here.

16
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:58,826
Well, as much as I hate
to agree with Nurse Hollywood,

17
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:00,480
she has got a good point.

18
00:01:00,977 --> 00:01:02,057
You need to take it easy

19
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:04,015
until we get the results
of the stress test.

20
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:06,083
After we get the all-clear,
I'd be happy...

21
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:09,027
Uh, I wasn't aware
that we had a heart attack.

22
00:01:09,527 --> 00:01:12,407
You seem to be getting all of your energy
from stress and caffeine.

23
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:16,279
I'm sorry, but how do you think
I manage to run this town?

24
00:01:16,367 --> 00:01:18,537
I don't get a lot of breaks.
I can tell you that much.

25
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:20,910
Right. Which means
you're not getting enough exercise.

26
00:01:20,997 --> 00:01:23,577
She's certainly flappin' those lips
all day long.

27
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:25,459
And...

28
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:28,247
ugh, these stairs are... are really steep.

29
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:29,668
I would feel much better

30
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:32,546
if you stayed down here
for just a few days.

31
00:01:33,134 --> 00:01:34,344
Anything else?

32
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:39,141
You're going to need to adopt
a heart-healthy diet.

33
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:43,104
- Cut out alcohol. Limit stress.
- Mel, dear.

34
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:45,726
Those are lovely ideas.
Just super.

35
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:49,484
For somebody else.
Because I'm not changing a damn thing.

36
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:51,605
Okay. Hope...

37
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:56,121
if you wanna continue living,
you're gonna have to learn to adapt.

38
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:01,617
You're the one who wanted me
to hire her back.

39
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:04,956
You just... just gonna leave that there?

40
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:09,634
Delivery!

41
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:12,631
Hey.

42
00:02:13,758 --> 00:02:14,758
Oh, hey.

43
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:18,604
I just came by to check on Hope.

44
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,680
Yeah, sure.

45
00:02:19,764 --> 00:02:21,774
Jack, what'd you bring me?

46
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:24,808
A little welcome-home treat. Aah.

47
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:31,821
Where's my bacon and eggs
with cheesy potatoes?

48
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:32,741
Oh, no, no.

49
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:35,489
Mel gave Preacher a list
of low-cholesterol foods.

50
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:38,242
- What the hell is this?
- That is a soy-based quiche.

51
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:39,324
Oh!

52
00:02:42,036 --> 00:02:42,906
What?

53
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:44,656
I... I... I need firewood.

54
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:47,461
Would you like me to get it?

55
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:49,502
God, no.

56
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:53,756
Okay, well, I got a chicken
for tonight's dinner

57
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,180
and some stir-fry vegetables.

58
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:56,678
And I'm gonna take this.

59
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:57,759
Good.

60
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:01,683
I'm gonna go through your fridge

61
00:03:01,764 --> 00:03:04,104
and throw out anything
that's not on your new diet.

62
00:03:04,475 --> 00:03:05,935
Don't touch my Velveeta.

63
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:07,729
Cheese is good for you.

64
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,070
So, what's with you two?

65
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:15,152
Nothin'.

66
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:18,244
Well, when was the last time you saw Mel?

67
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:20,410
Uh...

68
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:21,491
I don't know.

69
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:23,583
We didn't bump into each other
at the hospital,

70
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:26,830
so I guess it was that night
we got back from Lilly's.

71
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:28,715
We were at the bar,
and we ran into Charmaine.

72
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:30,335
Don't tell me.

73
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:33,629
Mel hadn't heard about your little friend
before meeting her?

74
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:35,941
No, I suppose she hadn't.

75
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:38,925
Good gravy, men can be such idiots.

76
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:40,465
Well, how was I an idiot?

77
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:42,183
Not enough time to go into that.

78
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:45,058
Uh... Mel?

79
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:51,307
Good news. I've seen the light.

80
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:54,898
I'm ready to live
under your fascist regime.

81
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:56,614
What happened in the last two minutes?

82
00:03:56,694 --> 00:03:59,204
You need to learn
to take yes for an answer,

83
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,950
but, um...
I do have a few demands of my own.

84
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:04,490
Okay.

85
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:08,617
The mattress in the downstairs bedroom
is older than dirt.

86
00:04:08,706 --> 00:04:10,786
You can feel the springs
jabbing you in the back.

87
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:13,625
I need the mattress
from my bedroom upstairs.

88
00:04:14,545 --> 00:04:15,415
Okay, I can do that.

89
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:17,465
Well, no, that, uh... weighs a ton.

90
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:18,943
- Jack and I can bring it down.
- Hm.

91
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:22,217
Vernon, let the younger generation
take this one.

92
00:04:22,303 --> 00:04:24,183
I certainly can handle
bringing a mattress down.

93
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:27,062
So, that's settled.
Jack and Mel will handle the mattress.

94
00:04:27,141 --> 00:04:29,561
You can help me with the kitchen.
In the kitchen.

95
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:33,520
Don't you need to get back to work?

96
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:35,360
No, not right now.

97
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:39,149
Okay. Well, just because you're free
doesn't mean you have to stay.

98
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:40,567
Oh, I'm happy to help.

99
00:04:49,497 --> 00:04:50,537
I was, uh...

100
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:54,186
I was at Lilly's the other day.
I must have just missed you.

101
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:55,960
Oh, yeah. She's doing really well.

102
00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:00,299
Yeah, well, it helps that we have
the whole town pitching in.

103
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:09,934
Hey, look, about, uh... that night,
you know, after Lilly's,

104
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:11,478
when we got back to town.

105
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:13,941
Yeah, your, uh...
your girlfriend was really nice.

106
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:15,572
I'm glad I got to meet her.

107
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:18,734
What?

108
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:21,395
I don't think of Charmaine
as my girlfriend.

109
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:23,528
I mean, we're more casual than that.

110
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:27,538
Okay, well, she introduced herself
as your girlfriend.

111
00:05:27,618 --> 00:05:29,998
Yeah. That's just the way she talks.

112
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:32,914
Great.

113
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:35,998
But you're dating.

114
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:38,246
Hm, I wouldn't really call it dating.

115
00:05:39,922 --> 00:05:41,132
What would you call it?

116
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:43,589
- Here. Let me...
- I got it.

117
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:46,470
I can help.

118
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:51,018
You know, we just see each other
from time to time.

119
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:54,901
- That's gonna get stuck.
- Okay. Listen, I've done this before.

120
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:59,225
Besides, if it came in through this door,
it's gotta come out through the door.

121
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:04,111
Well, hate to say I told you so.

122
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:06,659
You know, I've got it.
You don't have to...

123
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:11,075
Sure, go ahead.

124
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:14,373
You know, I think you're only seeing it
from your perspective.

125
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:16,997
- No, that's definitely stuck.
- No, I mean, with Charmaine.

126
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:19,045
Listen, Charmaine and I,
we have an understanding.

127
00:06:19,128 --> 00:06:21,208
You know, neither one of us
wanna be tied down.

128
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:22,628
Uh-huh.

129
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:23,795
- What?
- Nothing.

130
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:25,464
Doesn't sound like nothing.

131
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:28,760
Well, Charmaine didn't seem that casual,
that's all.

132
00:06:28,846 --> 00:06:31,426
- Well, she is. Trust me.
- What makes you say that?

133
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:33,016
She told me.

134
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:35,233
- When?
- When we first met.

135
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:36,311
And when was that?

136
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:38,306
A couple of years ago, I guess.

137
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:39,898
Wow. Okay.

138
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:43,318
Damn it.

139
00:06:44,278 --> 00:06:46,878
Well, I'll just be over here
on my side of the bed if you need me.

140
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:48,655
You can just go downstairs.

141
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:50,833
- I got it.
- Mm. Clearly.

142
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:56,872
Now, we need to go over
your new medications.

143
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:58,038
No, thanks.

144
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:00,131
You have got to take this seriously.

145
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:01,341
I am.

146
00:07:02,296 --> 00:07:03,836
Twice a day.

147
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:05,553
Once a day. Every other day.

148
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:09,724
Look, I know what you have been through,
it's very scary.

149
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:11,104
Confound her!

150
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:13,386
Mel threw out all the good stuff.

151
00:07:13,474 --> 00:07:16,354
She is trying to help.
Just like we all are.

152
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,396
You have had quite a scare.

153
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:21,936
It's expected you're gonna be feelin'
a little out of sorts.

154
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:26,238
After she leaves,
I'll go through the garbage.

155
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,030
Damn it, Hope! That's enough.

156
00:07:29,073 --> 00:07:30,993
This is a wake-up call.

157
00:07:31,075 --> 00:07:34,195
You're gonna have to make some changes,
now, before it's too late.

158
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:38,037
Vernon, I have always lived my life
on my own terms.

159
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:40,384
Nothing you say is going to change that.

160
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,380
Look, nobody said it was gonna be easy.

161
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,262
You just gotta take better care
of yourself.

162
00:07:44,338 --> 00:07:46,508
Where's all this newfound concern
coming from?

163
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:48,801
It is not new. It's concern.

164
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:51,545
Yes, I am concerned.
As I would be for any patient.

165
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:52,927
I'm not your patient.

166
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:56,894
No, but I am a doctor, uh,
with a lifetime of experience.

167
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:58,226
And you're a brilliant one

168
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:01,311
when you don't let your ego
and stubbornness get in the way.

169
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:03,691
Well, that's high praise indeed.

170
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:06,401
However...

171
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:08,486
as a husband, Vernon,

172
00:08:09,363 --> 00:08:10,663
you could have done better.

173
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:13,696
What does that mean?

174
00:08:35,264 --> 00:08:36,354
Divorce papers?

175
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:38,642
I had them drawn up when you moved out.

176
00:08:43,814 --> 00:08:46,284
Are you... are you asking for a divorce?

177
00:08:47,151 --> 00:08:49,701
It's time. Actually, it's long overdue.

178
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:53,283
Why? Why are you doing this now?

179
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:57,832
While I was in the hospital,

180
00:08:57,912 --> 00:09:01,082
I had a lot of time
to think about my life and...

181
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,588
how I wanna live what's left of it.

182
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:13,889
Well, these papers are 20 years old.

183
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,020
The time has come
to put our affairs in order.

184
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:20,351
Are you serious about this?

185
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:22,104
Serious as a heart attack.

186
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:28,993
One transgression 20 years ago.

187
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:39,786
Hope...

188
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:42,122
you realize...

189
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:44,789
if I sign those papers...

190
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:47,205
it... it's over.

191
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:49,125
We haven't been together in decades.

192
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:54,429
We just don't live together, but I...
I've always been there for you, always.

193
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:55,850
Don't put this on me.

194
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:58,259
You're the one who broke us.

195
00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:02,691
It's just time to finish what you started.

196
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:17,866
Still there?

197
00:10:19,243 --> 00:10:20,243
Yep.

198
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:22,622
So, you wanna try this again?

199
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:25,957
Yeah...

200
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:28,378
No other choice.

201
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:31,763
I meant together.

202
00:10:34,675 --> 00:10:36,215
Okay, Mel, seriously?

203
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,100
Is there anyone we know
who is not on this list?

204
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:42,141
The more the merrier.

205
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:44,726
Mel...

206
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:48,357
I think this is all too much.

207
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:51,359
Come on, you know
how much I love planning parties.

208
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:52,609
Yeah.

209
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,450
Can I be honest?

210
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:56,946
Always.

211
00:10:57,782 --> 00:10:59,532
I really don't need another shower.

212
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:02,367
- What? Since when?
- Since this is my third baby.

213
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:04,413
- I don't need anything.
- Uh...

214
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:07,209
- But it's a reason to celebrate.
- Mm...

215
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:08,631
So, we should celebrate.

216
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:11,086
Yeah.

217
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:17,428
Mark doesn't think it's a good idea
for you to be hosting a shower.

218
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:21,350
Yeah, well, we can count Mark as a "no"
'cause he's gonna be on call anyway.

219
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:26,886
You both just lost a baby.

220
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:32,609
- Don't look at me like that.
- How am I looking at you?

221
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,372
- Like you pity me.
- No, I don't pity you.

222
00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:36,588
I don't know why
you'd wanna put yourself through this.

223
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:38,242
Because this is normal.

224
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:42,701
You having a baby is normal.

225
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:46,664
Okay? Me planning your shower is normal.

226
00:11:46,747 --> 00:11:49,787
I just want normal again. Do you get that?

227
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:52,835
I just want something to be happy about.

228
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:58,683
I know, but forcing yourself to be happy
is not gonna work.

229
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:00,509
- Ugh...
- Okay?

230
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:04,521
- Sweetie, just let me help you.
- I don't need your help.

231
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:12,687
Oh...

232
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:16,316
How we doin'?

233
00:12:21,031 --> 00:12:22,161
Do you want me to go?

234
00:12:24,785 --> 00:12:26,365
- No.
- All right.

235
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:30,326
Then let's get this bad boy downstairs,
shall we?

236
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:32,541
C'mon.

237
00:12:32,626 --> 00:12:33,666
Shall we...

238
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,340
Wait!

239
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:40,217
You show-off.

240
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:41,931
Ah, just grab that end, will ya?

241
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:43,181
- I got it.
- Okay.

242
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:44,142
Hey, wait, wait, wait.

243
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:46,141
- What?
- I'm just adjusting my grip.

244
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:48,057
- All right.
- Yeah, yeah.

245
00:12:49,643 --> 00:12:50,943
Is it too heavy?

246
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,650
Ah, look, I'm gonna be carrying
all the weight down my end.

247
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:55,361
Oh. Okay.

248
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,525
Well, if you need a break...

249
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,296
- You know...
- I'd be happy to trade places.

250
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:02,360
Okay, this was a bad idea.
One sec. Okay.

251
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:05,081
Here we go...

252
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:08,833
I know. And I know how...

253
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:10,793
Nice to see you two working together.

254
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:12,753
All right,
let's just lean this up against here.

255
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,542
We'll swap out the other mattress.

256
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:18,209
Hey, where'd, uh... where'd Doc go?

257
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:20,927
- Oh, he had to leave.
- She means he escaped.

258
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:22,611
- Hah!
- I think I felt pretty much

259
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:24,045
as you're feeling right now.

260
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:26,716
- But I think it's a pretty low...
- Hey, Hope,

261
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:29,266
if this guest bedroom mattress
is too uncomfortable,

262
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,495
- Jack and I can get rid of it for you.
- Don't you dare.

263
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,439
I keep the guest bed lumpy
so people don't stay long.

264
00:13:35,397 --> 00:13:37,477
Well, makes perfect sense.

265
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:39,356
- Hey, you push. I'll pull.
- Okay.

266
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:41,066
Okay, ready?

267
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:42,783
Yep.

268
00:13:42,863 --> 00:13:45,573
But one day you'll realize
you've got to give and take.

269
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:49,749
- Jeez.
- Oh!

270
00:13:51,705 --> 00:13:52,785
Uh-oh. Here.

271
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:55,375
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, no, I just got a spasm.

272
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:57,419
- Oh, God.
- Does that happen often?

273
00:13:57,503 --> 00:14:00,093
No, just every once in a while. Oh.

274
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:02,258
I just gotta sit for a bit.

275
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:05,260
- Okay.
- You know, I think I have something.

276
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:06,724
No. Mel, I'm f...

277
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:09,144
- No, no, I'll be right back.
- I don't need...

278
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:33,713
Go!

279
00:14:34,331 --> 00:14:35,371
Stay down, sir.

280
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:36,537
You've lost a lot of blood.

281
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:38,924
- Move!
- We need to get out of here now.

282
00:14:42,631 --> 00:14:43,971
Gotta go, Jack.

283
00:14:46,802 --> 00:14:47,722
Go!

284
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:48,803
Wait!

285
00:14:52,182 --> 00:14:53,182
Here you go.

286
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:57,232
I'm just gonna grab a towel.

287
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,660
It's topical analgesic cream.

288
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:08,491
It'll help with inflammation.

289
00:15:09,116 --> 00:15:11,906
Oh, you... you carry that in your purse?

290
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:14,575
- Why, is that weird?
- A little.

291
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,830
- I'm a nurse.
- Still.

292
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:19,916
You know, I can... I can help.

293
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:22,592
No, I... I got it, I think.

294
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:24,261
You know what?

295
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:25,930
- Okay, you win.
- Okay.

296
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:28,228
Didn't know it was a competition.

297
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:30,432
What can I say?
I got a competitive streak.

298
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:33,181
Oh.

299
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:35,385
Okay, so where... where is it?

300
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:36,516
Lower left.

301
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:49,315
What happened here?

302
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:53,409
Iraq.

303
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:08,467
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

304
00:16:19,603 --> 00:16:21,863
Oh, and two of those
chocolate cream puffs.

305
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:23,984
My diet doesn't start till tomorrow.

306
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:26,252
Connie, you are perfect
just the way you are.

307
00:16:26,276 --> 00:16:29,696
Oh, I know you're lying, but I don't care.

308
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:32,657
I can't believe some nice woman
hasn't snatched you up.

309
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:35,737
Will that be all?

310
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:39,328
Let's add six snickerdoodles
and six chocolate chip

311
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:41,375
for the gals in my sewing circle.

312
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:44,336
And I assume y'all heard about Lilly.

313
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:48,380
At her age, having a baby
and then abandoning it.

314
00:16:48,465 --> 00:16:49,925
Oh! You think you know someone,

315
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:52,139
and then they go on
and do somethin' like that.

316
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:54,471
Well, I think Lilly is very brave.

317
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:56,345
She tried to do right by her child.

318
00:16:56,432 --> 00:17:00,192
Well, I don't see how leaving your baby
on a doorstep is doin' right.

319
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:04,189
Well, I don't think we're in any position
to judge Lilly or her actions.

320
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:08,279
Well, I heard that Hope was
so stressed out by this whole Lilly thing

321
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,150
that that's what gave her
her heart attack.

322
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:12,948
- Who told you that?
- Oh, I'm not gonna name names,

323
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:16,242
but my niece was over
gettin' her hair done in Clear River,

324
00:17:16,326 --> 00:17:18,926
and she heard from one of the ladies,
who's a client of Charmaine,

325
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:20,834
who obviously heard from Jack,

326
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:23,708
that Hope was a ball of nerves
over that baby.

327
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:26,133
That'll be $19.80, Connie.

328
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:27,211
Thank you.

329
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:30,126
This is for that sweet boy of yours.

330
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:32,585
Bless his heart, not havin' a daddy.

331
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:34,719
You all take care.

332
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:38,808
Yeah, she means well.

333
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:40,266
Does she?

334
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:55,664
I'm not dead yet. Thanks.

335
00:17:56,867 --> 00:17:57,867
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

336
00:17:57,951 --> 00:17:59,871
I made you
a chicken and biscuit casserole.

337
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:02,872
- Drop cream biscuits?
- Is there any other kind?

338
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:09,090
I'll just, uh, tuck this away somewhere.

339
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:12,008
Preacher said Jack might be here?

340
00:18:12,966 --> 00:18:14,926
Um... He's upstairs.

341
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:16,010
Oh, yeah?

342
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:19,058
He insisted on moving some furniture
for me.

343
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:20,179
My mom always said

344
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:22,935
you know you got a good man
when he pitches in without...

345
00:18:23,977 --> 00:18:25,267
without being asked.

346
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:30,979
You know, maybe...
I'm just gonna go upstairs

347
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:32,898
and tell Jack I'm here.

348
00:18:32,986 --> 00:18:35,406
He's not expecting me,
so I might as well just...

349
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:36,569
I'm just gonna...

350
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:37,657
Hi.

351
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:41,197
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

352
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:42,829
What are you doing here?

353
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:43,871
Well, I just...

354
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:45,581
Hi, Charmaine.

355
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:48,456
Did I forget to mention that Mel
is here too?

356
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:54,304
Uh... I'm gonna go put these down.

357
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:07,057
- I tried it, and I really liked it.
- Yeah.

358
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,056
Great, huh?

359
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:10,977
Hey. Where is my apprentice?

360
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:14,526
Oh, Christopher has two math chapters
to finish before dinner.

361
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:15,451
Oh.

362
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:17,249
You ever thought
of enrolling him in school?

363
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:20,412
Now I hear Virgin River Elementary
is pretty good,

364
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:22,162
considering we live in the sticks.

365
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:24,084
Uh... he's gifted.

366
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:27,043
Yeah, you know what? That he is.

367
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:30,634
No, what I mean is...
is, uh, I'm afraid he'd be bored

368
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:31,841
by a standard curriculum.

369
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,800
- Mm.
- Yeah.

370
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,380
- Back off.
- Hey!

371
00:19:35,632 --> 00:19:37,132
Is everything okay?

372
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:39,639
Yeah. Just some guys blowin' off steam.

373
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:41,809
Okay. What do I owe you?

374
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:42,889
You know what? That...

375
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,640
is on the house.

376
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:46,728
Preacher, you can't keep doing this.

377
00:19:48,478 --> 00:19:50,308
But thanks.

378
00:19:51,231 --> 00:19:52,361
- See ya.
- Yeah.

379
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:55,106
Oh. Hey.

380
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:56,324
Paige.

381
00:19:57,779 --> 00:19:58,779
I...

382
00:20:00,657 --> 00:20:03,197
would like to settle... our last order.

383
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:05,870
Thank you.

384
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:07,786
I really do appreciate this.

385
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:09,463
I'll see you later.

386
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:13,125
- Oh. Oh, God!
- Sorry! Sorry!

387
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:15,172
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay. Don't worry about it.

388
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:16,804
Don't wo... Oh, my God.

389
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:18,182
Michelle?

390
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:20,638
I haven't seen you
since college graduation.

391
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:22,549
I think you've mistaken me
for someone else.

392
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:23,928
My name is Paige.

393
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:27,854
Oh, uh... you look exactly like
someone I went to BU with.

394
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:30,515
Oh, gosh, definitely not me, then.
I didn't go to college.

395
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:32,194
Oh, I'm, uh... Sorry.

396
00:20:32,272 --> 00:20:34,942
I'm just... I can't believe how much
you look like Michelle.

397
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:36,355
- It's okay.
- Yeah.

398
00:20:36,443 --> 00:20:37,783
- Take care.
- Okay.

399
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:40,411
Oh, wait. Maybe you can help me. I'm lost.

400
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:43,199
Well, my husband's lost.
He refuses to ask for directions.

401
00:20:43,283 --> 00:20:45,493
Can you tell me how to get back
to Route 36?

402
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:48,997
Hey, you know, I got this. You, uh...
You go out. You make a left.

403
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:51,001
Second stop sign, you take a right.

404
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,753
- You can't miss it.
- Oh! Thank you so much.

405
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:55,503
Phew!

406
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:57,343
Uncanny.

407
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:05,101
That has never happened to me before.
That is so weird.

408
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,140
See ya.

409
00:21:17,734 --> 00:21:20,904
I could have sworn you told me
you had a psychology degree.

410
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:22,405
Me?

411
00:21:22,739 --> 00:21:24,659
No. You must be thinking of someone else.

412
00:21:24,741 --> 00:21:26,451
I started working
right out of high school.

413
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:39,269
- Okay, that's it.
- Try it.

414
00:21:40,882 --> 00:21:41,882
Hey!

415
00:21:42,175 --> 00:21:43,569
- Hey, cool it!
- Knock it off!

416
00:21:43,593 --> 00:21:45,353
Cool it. Knock it off!

417
00:21:45,929 --> 00:21:47,559
Get up. Get off.

418
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,470
Now, do we got a problem here?

419
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,096
No problem, Preacher.

420
00:21:53,186 --> 00:21:54,306
No problem at all.

421
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:29,684
It is so sweet of you to invite me
to eat dinner with you all.

422
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:32,135
- It was delicious.
- It was bland.

423
00:22:32,976 --> 00:22:34,596
What's for dessert? Gruel?

424
00:22:35,103 --> 00:22:37,023
All right, don't listen to her.
It was great.

425
00:22:37,647 --> 00:22:38,647
Thanks.

426
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:40,829
I'm sorry about the casserole.

427
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:42,741
I didn't know about
her dietary restrictions.

428
00:22:42,819 --> 00:22:45,449
If you'd kept your mouth shut,
I could have had it for breakfast.

429
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:49,080
Jack's always saying
how I can't keep a secret.

430
00:22:49,659 --> 00:22:51,289
I guess I'm just an open book.

431
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:53,960
And here I am doing all the talking.

432
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:57,463
What about you, Mel? Are you enjoying
your visit to Virgin River?

433
00:22:57,542 --> 00:22:58,592
She's not visiting.

434
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:00,674
She's working with Doc.

435
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:03,798
Mel is a nurse practitioner and midwife.

436
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:05,341
Oh.

437
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:08,136
So... so, you just... just moved here.

438
00:23:08,845 --> 00:23:10,345
Yeah, from Los Angeles.

439
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:13,522
And is your husband here?

440
00:23:14,976 --> 00:23:15,976
Um...

441
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:18,441
No, he couldn't, uh, make the trip.

442
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:20,897
Oh. Wh... when's he coming?

443
00:23:20,982 --> 00:23:25,032
I was thinking maybe the four of us
could go grab some dinner one night.

444
00:23:25,946 --> 00:23:27,906
He's, uh... he's not gonna be joining me.

445
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:30,825
- But why not?
- Um...

446
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:32,535
What?

447
00:23:32,994 --> 00:23:33,834
It's fine.

448
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:38,252
Charmaine, not everyone wants to talk
about their personal life with strangers.

449
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:41,714
Um...

450
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:43,379
I'm sorry, I...

451
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:46,169
I didn't mean anything by it, Mel. I'm...

452
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:47,777
I'm a hairstylist.

453
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:50,301
I'm just used to asking
a lot of questions.

454
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:52,807
I'm sorry. It's my sister.
I gotta take this.

455
00:23:52,889 --> 00:23:54,099
Excuse me.

456
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:59,520
- May I use your bathroom?
- Yeah. Down the hall.

457
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:00,654
Thank you.

458
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:12,736
Having fun?

459
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:18,831
Hey. What's goin' on over there?

460
00:24:18,915 --> 00:24:20,125
Keep it down, please!

461
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:21,918
I am on the phone.

462
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:23,462
I got it, honey.

463
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:26,130
I can crate the dogs.
Why can't I crate the kids?

464
00:24:26,214 --> 00:24:28,304
We both know you're joking.

465
00:24:28,383 --> 00:24:31,013
I left them with Bill so I could go
to the grocery store in peace.

466
00:24:31,094 --> 00:24:34,354
And while he had his head in the computer,
they got all jacked up on sugar.

467
00:24:35,265 --> 00:24:37,635
Where are you? Reception sounds horrible.

468
00:24:38,226 --> 00:24:40,266
Um, I'm at, uh, Hope's house,

469
00:24:40,353 --> 00:24:42,653
having dinner with Jack
and his girlfriend.

470
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:44,435
The guy from the bar?

471
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:48,129
You didn't mention anything
about him having a girlfriend.

472
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:49,323
Oh, I didn't know.

473
00:24:49,613 --> 00:24:50,613
Hm.

474
00:24:50,697 --> 00:24:52,117
Secret girlfriend, huh?

475
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:55,874
I mean, I'm having dinner
with her. She's not so secret.

476
00:24:56,703 --> 00:24:57,823
From everything you told me,

477
00:24:57,871 --> 00:24:59,591
you've been spending
a lot of time together.

478
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:01,123
Yeah, I guess... I guess we have.

479
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:03,418
And he never mentioned anything
about his girlfriend?

480
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:06,762
- Don't you think that's weird?
- No. I mean, he said it was casual.

481
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:08,474
And you know, I mean,

482
00:25:08,548 --> 00:25:10,718
he's just being nice to me
because I'm new in town.

483
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:14,139
She was asking about Mark.

484
00:25:14,804 --> 00:25:15,934
Why would she do that?

485
00:25:17,724 --> 00:25:19,814
I'm still wearing my wedding ring.

486
00:25:21,269 --> 00:25:22,479
You're still wearing it?

487
00:25:25,732 --> 00:25:28,442
Maybe it would help to talk about it.
I don't know.

488
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:31,107
There are no rules on the best way
to handle these things.

489
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:32,486
No. Jo, I...

490
00:25:33,114 --> 00:25:35,584
I... I gotta get back to dinner. Um...

491
00:25:36,743 --> 00:25:38,333
I'll talk to you later, okay?

492
00:25:38,912 --> 00:25:40,502
- Fine. Bye.
- Bye.

493
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:56,349
Hey. You guys are leaving?

494
00:25:57,055 --> 00:25:59,345
Yeah. I need to drive Charmaine back
to Clear River.

495
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:03,404
I had a friend drop me off,
and Hope doesn't want us to do the dishes.

496
00:26:03,478 --> 00:26:05,148
Are you sure that we can't stay and help?

497
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:06,570
I'm perfectly capable.

498
00:26:07,357 --> 00:26:09,147
Well, you let me know
if you need anything.

499
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:13,992
Well, hope to see you around.

500
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:15,202
Yeah.

501
00:26:16,199 --> 00:26:17,199
Night, Jack.

502
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:19,702
Night.

503
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:25,250
Are you sure
I can't help with the dishes?

504
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:26,422
Knock yourself out.

505
00:26:26,501 --> 00:26:29,171
I just wanted Perky Penny out of my hair.

506
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:44,893
- Hey.
- Hi.

507
00:26:44,978 --> 00:26:47,018
So, you're not a big fan of Charmaine,
I take it.

508
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:49,395
Huh! Is it that obvious?

509
00:26:51,985 --> 00:26:55,405
I mean, I don't... I don't see why.
She seems perfectly sweet.

510
00:26:55,488 --> 00:26:58,198
Sweet isn't good enough for Jack.

511
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:03,582
Hope, Jack's a big boy.
I'm sure he knows what he's doing.

512
00:27:03,663 --> 00:27:07,293
You think it's sweet to ask someone
you hardly know personal questions?

513
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:09,249
I didn't really mind.

514
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:13,127
You always answer your cell phone
in the middle of dinner?

515
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:18,724
There are things that have happened
in the last few years that...

516
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:21,505
I just don't wanna talk about.

517
00:27:21,598 --> 00:27:22,598
I figured.

518
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:25,389
You did?

519
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:28,607
Doesn't take a rocket scientist
to figure out a good-looking,

520
00:27:28,688 --> 00:27:31,938
accomplished nurse from LA
moving to the middle of nowhere

521
00:27:32,025 --> 00:27:34,025
might be running from something.

522
00:27:35,403 --> 00:27:38,113
Well, I'm not a fugitive,
if that's what you're asking.

523
00:27:39,699 --> 00:27:42,119
As far as I'm concerned,
your business is your business.

524
00:27:43,578 --> 00:27:45,118
Thanks, I appreciate that.

525
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:47,544
But can I give you a piece of advice?

526
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:50,668
What is it?

527
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:55,876
I think if you focus on
protecting your heart...

528
00:27:57,425 --> 00:27:59,085
you can avoid a lot of pain.

529
00:28:00,261 --> 00:28:03,351
But you can also end up
living half a life.

530
00:28:13,274 --> 00:28:14,274
Mmm.

531
00:28:15,485 --> 00:28:17,105
You know what we two gals need?

532
00:28:18,238 --> 00:28:19,238
Fred Astaire.

533
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:21,905
Follow me, girlie.

534
00:28:22,826 --> 00:28:23,826
Come on.

535
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:34,878
Come on, movie's starting.

536
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:39,296
What is that face for?

537
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:40,394
I'm excited.

538
00:28:40,468 --> 00:28:41,718
- Are you?
- Yeah.

539
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:46,430
I can't wait to watch Die Hard

540
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:48,436
for the millionth time.

541
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:50,654
Die Hard is a classic.

542
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:51,729
Oh, okay.

543
00:28:52,772 --> 00:28:55,442
You know, your definition of classic
is severely flawed.

544
00:28:55,525 --> 00:28:57,645
Why don't you pick
something else from my queue?

545
00:28:57,736 --> 00:28:59,526
No, no. It's not my turn.

546
00:28:59,612 --> 00:29:01,702
- I'm gonna make an exception this time.
- Really?

547
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:03,452
Okay, you choose. We got...

548
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:05,075
The Big Wedding.

549
00:29:05,326 --> 00:29:07,286
Wedding Crashers. Royal Wedding.

550
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:09,660
Muriel's Wedding. The Wedding Singer.

551
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:11,538
Father of the Bride.

552
00:29:11,624 --> 00:29:12,714
Bridesmaids.

553
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:15,093
Oh, and my personal favorite...

554
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:18,208
The Proposal.

555
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:21,471
I think you should probably look in there.

556
00:29:34,147 --> 00:29:35,397
Are you proposing to me?

557
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:38,112
No, I just really want to watch
a Sandra Bullock movie.

558
00:29:40,987 --> 00:29:42,607

559

"Mom, I met the woman
that I wanna grow old with."

565
00:30:06,262 --> 00:30:08,722
Melinda Janson, if you say yes to me,

566
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:11,477
I promise you, I promise you...

567
00:30:13,269 --> 00:30:16,109

I love you.

574
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:31,792

581

What are you doing?

582
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:33,976
I didn't think you should be alone
for the first few nights.

583
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:35,688
So, you slept out here all night?

584
00:31:36,227 --> 00:31:38,227
Well, I didn't feel like coming inside.

585
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:49,160
Did you sign the papers?

586
00:31:49,699 --> 00:31:50,699
I can't.

587
00:31:51,492 --> 00:31:53,122
You're not going to talk me out of this.

588
00:31:53,202 --> 00:31:54,582
The papers are 20 years old.

589
00:31:54,662 --> 00:31:57,672
They need to be redrafted
with a current date.

590
00:31:57,749 --> 00:32:00,419
- Fine. I'll speak with my lawyer.
- Well, that might be tough.

591
00:32:00,501 --> 00:32:01,841
Your lawyer's deceased.

592
00:32:03,129 --> 00:32:04,259
- Oh.
- Hm.

593
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:08,593
Well, I could find someone else
to draw up new papers,

594
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:10,394
if that's what you want.

595
00:32:16,684 --> 00:32:17,684
Oh.

596
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:21,645
Forskolin?

597
00:32:21,731 --> 00:32:24,031
Yeah.
This will strengthen your heart muscle.

598
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:26,449
You always said herbs
were a bunch of malarkey.

599
00:32:26,486 --> 00:32:29,026
Yeah, well, I talked to your doctor
at Grace Valley,

600
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:33,583
and she agrees that this supplement
taken with your other medications

601
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:34,490
is a good idea.

602
00:32:34,577 --> 00:32:35,747
Where'd you get this?

603
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:37,329
In Eureka.

604
00:32:37,872 --> 00:32:39,212
You hate the city.

605
00:32:39,707 --> 00:32:42,787
I do, but that was the only store
that had Forskolin in stock.

606
00:32:43,753 --> 00:32:45,803
I appreciate you going
to all this trouble,

607
00:32:46,506 --> 00:32:48,006
but my mind's made up.

608
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:51,218
Okay.

609
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:09,321
Well,
the food budget is down a bit.

610
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:12,284
A lot of the hunters have been generous
with their donations this month.

611
00:33:12,365 --> 00:33:15,655
Oh, and here you were giving me grief
about comping their meals, huh?

612
00:33:17,036 --> 00:33:18,706
Bar sales holding steady.

613
00:33:19,372 --> 00:33:20,832
No more discrepancies.

614
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:23,792
Good.

615
00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:26,628
Hey, will you, uh... send Brady in?

616
00:33:29,048 --> 00:33:30,048
Brady.

617
00:33:35,471 --> 00:33:36,471
What's up?

618
00:33:36,889 --> 00:33:37,889
Oh.

619
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:39,981
I thought... payday was Friday.

620
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:41,810
Oh, it is.

621
00:33:42,395 --> 00:33:43,855
You've been working hard, and...

622
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:45,522
I appreciate it.

623
00:33:46,107 --> 00:33:48,567
And, hey, if you ever need anything...

624
00:33:49,944 --> 00:33:50,944
money...

625
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:53,739
whatever...

626
00:33:55,324 --> 00:33:56,324
just ask.

627
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:58,035
Okay?

628
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:00,996
Yeah.

629
00:34:03,249 --> 00:34:04,249
Thank you.

630
00:34:12,175 --> 00:34:13,045
Oh, hey.

631
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:14,594
- Hey.
- How was your run?

632
00:34:15,136 --> 00:34:16,426
- It was great.
- Hah!

633
00:34:16,512 --> 00:34:18,852
Explain to me how running can be great.

634
00:34:18,931 --> 00:34:22,771
Well, I used to run on a treadmill
that projected pictures of the forest,

635
00:34:22,852 --> 00:34:25,652
and now I run through an actual forest.

636
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:27,320
Oh, no, no, no, no. The forest I get,

637
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:29,198
but you're never gonna sell me
on the running.

638
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:33,988
So, last night's dinner was interesting.

639
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:36,907
Was it?

640
00:34:38,451 --> 00:34:39,991
Did Charmaine enjoy herself?

641
00:34:41,454 --> 00:34:43,124
Look, I'm sorry about all the questions.

642
00:34:43,206 --> 00:34:45,626
No, you don't have to apologize.
I can handle it.

643
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:50,342
Yeah, I know. It's what I like about you.

644
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:55,383
I was wondering how long you think
it would take me to get to Myrtle Farms.

645
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:58,466
Ooh, that's a way.
That's like 40 miles out of town.

646
00:34:58,554 --> 00:34:59,554
Hmm.

647
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:02,768
Well, Preacher said they have
the best organic produce around,

648
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:05,010
so I was thinking I could pick up
some things for Hope.

649
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,110
Well, is Doc gonna go with you?

650
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:08,188
No, why?

651
00:35:08,731 --> 00:35:09,861
Well...

652
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:11,361
I don't know. I mean...

653
00:35:13,194 --> 00:35:15,244
the turnoff is pretty tricky to find.

654
00:35:15,321 --> 00:35:18,871
And with all the rain we've had,
I mean, the roads could be flooded.

655
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:22,410
Your best bet would be
to... find a local to take you.

656
00:35:22,495 --> 00:35:24,115
And who might that be?

657
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:27,459
Well, preferably someone
who's self-employed,

658
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:29,342
who can take time out of their day.

659
00:35:29,418 --> 00:35:31,748
I don't know anyone like that.

660
00:35:32,213 --> 00:35:34,223
Come on.
Why don't I tell the boys to cover for me?

661
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:36,298
Okay. I have a short day at the clinic.

662
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:37,844
You wanna pick me up in a few hours?

663
00:35:37,927 --> 00:35:40,217
Oh. If you insist.

664
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:49,609
Yeah, Washington Gorge Road,
about ten miles up.

665
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:53,781
All right, well, tell Bert I said thanks.

666
00:35:58,322 --> 00:35:59,532
Well, I have no bars.

667
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:03,485
Apparently, I'm not signed up
for Sprint's Wilderness Plan.

668
00:36:04,245 --> 00:36:05,495
Oh, we're good.

669
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:09,420
They said Bert's out on another job,
but he'll get to us before nightfall.

670
00:36:10,126 --> 00:36:11,126
Nightfall.

671
00:36:11,252 --> 00:36:12,592
- Yeah.
- Is that a time?

672
00:36:13,087 --> 00:36:14,547
Hah! In Virgin River? Yeah.

673
00:36:15,631 --> 00:36:17,221
How do they stay in business?

674
00:36:17,967 --> 00:36:21,097
They're the only gas station
with a tow truck within 100 miles.

675
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:22,969
Ah. Solid business plan.

676
00:36:23,055 --> 00:36:25,215
I cannot believe you don't have
a spare tire.

677
00:36:25,766 --> 00:36:27,226
I lent it to a neighbor.

678
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:30,190
You know, right now I wish you were
just a little bit less accommodating.

679
00:36:30,229 --> 00:36:31,859
Okay. I'll work on that for you.

680
00:36:33,649 --> 00:36:34,649
Come on.

681
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:36,736
Ah, could be a while.

682
00:36:39,238 --> 00:36:40,698
Can I ask you a question?

683
00:36:41,991 --> 00:36:42,991
Shoot.

684
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:47,750
Why are you so insistent
on keeping things casual with Charmaine?

685
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:54,920
I don't know.

686
00:36:55,338 --> 00:36:56,338
Yes, you do.

687
00:37:00,092 --> 00:37:01,682
What, you want the real reason?

688
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:05,391
Of course I want the real reason.

689
00:37:07,767 --> 00:37:10,647
My dad didn't treat my mother
with the kind of respect

690
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:12,188
that I thought she deserved.

691
00:37:12,271 --> 00:37:15,021
And you're worried
that you're gonna do the same thing?

692
00:37:15,107 --> 00:37:18,317
It's the whole apple doesn't fall far
from the tree thing, I guess.

693
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:22,779
I've spent my entire life
trying to be different from my dad.

694
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:26,160
And as I got older,
I'd hear myself say something,

695
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:28,204
or I'd do something, and I'd realize...

696
00:37:31,123 --> 00:37:32,123
he's right here.

697
00:37:33,834 --> 00:37:36,464
I consider myself
to be a pretty good judge of character.

698
00:37:36,796 --> 00:37:37,796
Mm?

699
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:41,512
Which is why I think you're worried
about something that will never happen.

700
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:43,262
Oh, no, I know it's not gonna happen...

701
00:37:43,886 --> 00:37:46,426
'cause I'm not ever gonna be
in a relationship with her.

702
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:49,524
You are in a relationship with her.

703
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:54,730
Jack, Charmaine is not just some woman
you occasionally hook up with at a bar.

704
00:37:54,814 --> 00:37:58,194
I have been perfectly clear
with my intentions from the start.

705
00:37:58,276 --> 00:37:59,486
I know, but it doesn't matter.

706
00:37:59,568 --> 00:38:02,358
Sometimes you can't separate your heart
from your head.

707
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:05,493
I'm beginning to understand that.

708
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:09,872
This isn't a good idea.

709
00:38:09,996 --> 00:38:12,286
♪ Hoping, hiding ♪

710
00:38:13,207 --> 00:38:15,037
I don't want to be in the middle
of anything.

711
00:38:15,751 --> 00:38:18,381
- You're not.
- Well, last night I felt like I was.

712
00:38:20,214 --> 00:38:22,434
I don't want anyone's feelings
to get hurt.

713
00:38:25,261 --> 00:38:26,261
Well, I'll...

714
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:30,392
give Bert another call,
see where that tow truck's at.

715
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:36,978
♪ And I wonder who ♪

716
00:38:37,106 --> 00:38:40,026
♪ Who ♪

717
00:38:40,109 --> 00:38:43,029
♪ Well, I wonder who ♪

718
00:38:43,112 --> 00:38:46,122
♪ Who ♪

719
00:38:46,198 --> 00:38:48,078
♪ Well, I wonder who ♪

720
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:50,203
This stuff smells.

721
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:52,908
I know, buddy, but it's only for a bit.

722
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:54,707
I don't want to do this anymore.

723
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:56,330
I'm sorry, but we have to.

724
00:38:56,917 --> 00:38:58,127
For how long?

725
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:01,383
Until I can be sure we're both safe.

726
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:15,352
Damn it.

727
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:18,654
Phone just died. Is yours workin'?

728
00:39:19,398 --> 00:39:20,398
No.

729
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:25,030
Great. This day just keeps getting better
and better.

730
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:30,790
Look, I'm sorry that I upset you
by bringing up Charmaine.

731
00:39:30,868 --> 00:39:34,458
It's just that I feel like she deserves
to know where she stands.

732
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:36,118
She knows where she stands,

733
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:39,207
because from the very beginning,
I have been very clear with her.

734
00:39:39,293 --> 00:39:41,503
I told her
that I didn't want a relationship,

735
00:39:41,962 --> 00:39:43,962
that I wasn't lookin'
for anything permanent.

736
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:47,390
And she understood.
She said she didn't want that either.

737
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:49,926
I'm not the bad guy here.

738
00:39:50,012 --> 00:39:51,392
I didn't say you were.

739
00:39:51,472 --> 00:39:52,892
Kind of sounds like you are.

740
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:11,663
You wouldn't happen to have a spare,
would you?

741
00:40:22,628 --> 00:40:24,128
What y'all doing on this road?

742
00:40:25,714 --> 00:40:28,134
I don't really think
that's any of your business, is it?

743
00:40:29,552 --> 00:40:32,352
Hey, uh, we're, uh...
we're just on our way down the road

744
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:33,850
to go to a farm near here

745
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:36,431
to pick up some stuff
for a patient of mine.

746
00:40:37,309 --> 00:40:38,389
You a doctor?

747
00:40:38,727 --> 00:40:40,437
I'm a nurse practitioner.

748
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:43,441
Oh, that's good. You need to come with me.

749
00:40:44,316 --> 00:40:45,986
- Excuse me?
- You need to back off.

750
00:40:46,068 --> 00:40:47,318
And if I don't?
