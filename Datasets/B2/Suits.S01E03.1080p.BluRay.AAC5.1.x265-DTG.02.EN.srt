1
00:00:27,235 --> 00:00:29,695
The 2011
Tesla Roadster Sport.

2
00:00:29,821 --> 00:00:32,281
Offered only
to our most exclusive members.

3
00:00:32,407 --> 00:00:33,866
You know your vehicles.

4
00:00:33,992 --> 00:00:36,410
I promise to have her back
before she turns into a Pontiac.

5
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:38,579
- Hey, Harvey.
- Laurence.

6
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:41,540
How would you feel about taking
something other than the Tesla tonight?

7
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:42,958
It goes against my policy.

8
00:00:43,084 --> 00:00:44,126
What policy?

9
00:00:44,252 --> 00:00:45,794
My I-want-the-Tesla
policy.

10
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:46,754
Yeah.

11
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:50,090
Tell you what.
You know more about the car than I do,

12
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:53,427
it's yours.

13
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:57,222
Horsepower.

14
00:00:57,348 --> 00:00:59,016
Really?
That's where we're starting?

15
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:01,435
Well, if it's so simple,
just answer it.

16
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:03,562
288.

17
00:01:03,688 --> 00:01:06,398
- Top speed.
- 125 miles an hour.

18
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:09,234
- Zero to sixty...
- 3.7 seconds.

19
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,612
Yeah. You know your cars.

20
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:12,946
I'm an enthusiast.

21
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:14,823
And I've been waiting
for the Tesla for months.

22
00:01:14,949 --> 00:01:15,824
Okay.

23
00:01:19,996 --> 00:01:21,413
Laurence.

24
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:25,000
Knock yourself out.

25
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:27,419
So, why did you let him have it?

26
00:01:27,545 --> 00:01:30,506
Because it never hurts to have a man
who runs a two billion dollar hedge fund

27
00:01:30,632 --> 00:01:31,465
owe you one.

28
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:33,175
But if you were
just going to give it to him,

29
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:34,593
why bother
to compete first?

30
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:37,387
Because if I didn't beat him,
he wouldn't feel like he owed me one.

31
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:39,014
I'm suddenly feeling
old school.

32
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:40,390
Why don't you surprise me,
huh?

33
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:50,150
Are you Mike Ross?

34
00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:56,156
Harvey told me to tell you
that 8:00 means 8:00.

35
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:20,430
Whoa.

36
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:21,557
Glad you showed up.

37
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:22,558
Oh. Hey, I'm sorry.
I was...

38
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:24,309
- Shut up.
- Okay.

39
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:25,853
You see these cars?

40
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:27,604
Yeah. They're awesome.

41
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:30,357
They suck.
They're nothing compared to this.

42
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:31,692
Whoa.

43
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:34,111
The engine in this car
is made by McKernon Motors.

44
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:37,030
The industry standard
in Formula One.

45
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:40,868
In fact, they've won more championships
than any other engine on the planet.

46
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:42,494
How do you
know all this?

47
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:45,414
Avery McKernon was the first client
I ever brought into the firm.

48
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:46,540
Was?

49
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:47,958
He died three months ago.

50
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:49,668
- Oh, God. I'm so sorry.
- Not the point.

51
00:02:49,794 --> 00:02:53,046
McKernon's engines and his company
have something in common.

52
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:55,007
They win. Like me.

53
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:57,301
And because I win,
I've been promoted to senior partner,

54
00:02:57,427 --> 00:02:59,261
which means you'll be handling
all their paperwork.

55
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:01,680
So you brought me here to give me
an appreciation for the product.

56
00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:05,058
No, I brought you here
to meet Robert Stensland, the new CEO.

57
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:06,852
He'll want to put a face
with your name.

58
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:07,853
How do you know?

59
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:11,148
Because Robert's a tightwad,
and we don't bill you out for nothing.

60
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:13,233
Wait a minute.
Is this conversation right now billable?

61
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:14,359
You bet your ass it is.

62
00:03:14,485 --> 00:03:16,987
Yes. Up top. Come on.

63
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:19,948
What? We're making all this money.
We can't celebrate it?

64
00:03:20,074 --> 00:03:21,450
Not in poor taste.

65
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:24,995
Dominic.

66
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:27,039
Mike, I'd like you to meet
Dominic Barone,

67
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:30,667
the man responsible for the design
and production of this engine.

68
00:03:30,793 --> 00:03:32,586
This is my new associate,
Mike Ross.

69
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:35,380
He's just a kid. Are you trying to steal
his soul before he hits puberty?

70
00:03:35,506 --> 00:03:36,548
Okay.
Obviously, I'm long past...

71
00:03:36,674 --> 00:03:38,383
You're still upset
about our labor negotiations.

72
00:03:38,509 --> 00:03:40,260
Well,
my workers took a big hit.

73
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:41,803
And McKernon took a bigger one.

74
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:44,431
Both of which poised the company
to be strong for years.

75
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:45,974
I was always straight
with you about that.

76
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,684
Sophisticated words
for a guy who screwed us.

77
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:49,019
Look.
I'm sorry you feel that way,

78
00:03:49,145 --> 00:03:53,148
but you have to admit I did have
the courtesy to do it from the front.

79
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:58,654
Wow. Yeah, he really appreciates
what you've done for the company.

80
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:03,033
Robert Stensland. I'd like you
to meet your new associate, Mike Ross.

81
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:04,785
We're not paying him
what we pay you.

82
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:08,455
Nor should you. But I assure you,
he's highly effective.

83
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:09,748
Well, I'll believe it
when I see it.

84
00:04:09,874 --> 00:04:12,459
I had him read
your corporate lease last week.

85
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:14,086
Ask him anything.

86
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:15,504
That's a 300-page document.

87
00:04:18,716 --> 00:04:20,592
Okay. What are the terms?

88
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:22,552
Okay. I have no idea
what you're talking about.

89
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:26,640
The named lessee was the parent
company, Glendon Enterprises.

90
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:30,143
35,000 square feet
at 19, West 57th,

91
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,645
$80 a foot.

92
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:36,400
Expires in six months, with an option
to extend exercisable in thirty days.

93
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:38,819
Who signed the lease?

94
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:40,070
You did.

95
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:41,738
- What's my middle name?
- The letter "L".

96
00:04:41,864 --> 00:04:44,992
What happens in the event
the company no longer exists?

97
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:46,910
- That wasn't in the lease.
- How can you be sure?

98
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:49,037
Because the lease I read
wasn't 300 pages.

99
00:04:49,163 --> 00:04:50,747
It was 364.

100
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:52,833
And I could tell you
what's on any one of those pages,

101
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,126
but I can't tell you that.

102
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:55,752
That's how I can be sure.

103
00:04:55,878 --> 00:04:57,004
Excellent.

104
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,922
You can get him started
on the new deal right away.

105
00:04:59,048 --> 00:04:59,881
New deal?

106
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:03,635
Yeah. I have found a buyer
willing to spend $200 million dollars

107
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:05,721
for the ground underneath
the flagship factory.

108
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:07,306
Where are you moving manufacturing?

109
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:08,765
Well,
that's the beauty of it.

110
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:11,018
The real asset of McKernon Motors
is the name.

111
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:13,103
We move overseas,
we save ourselves a bundle.

112
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:16,189
Upfront payout, while retaining the name
and maintaining cash flow over time.

113
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,190
That's genius.

114
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,109
- Exactly.
- We'll take care of everything.

115
00:05:19,235 --> 00:05:21,028
- Okay.
- All right.

116
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:23,739
Yeah. Thanks.

117
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:25,282
Really?

118
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:26,992
Jesus.
I knew he was cheap.

119
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:28,618
I didn't realize
he was an idiot.

120
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:29,578
What are you
talking about?

121
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:31,288
The asset's not the name.
It's the quality.

122
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:32,581
He moves overseas,

123
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:35,459
he's going to kill the goose
that laid the goddamn golden engine.

124
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:38,920
Wait a minute. I thought you didn't
get emotionally attached to the client.

125
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:40,339
I'm emotionally attached
to me.

126
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:42,466
Look. I made a bet
that this company would grow

127
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:44,217
and my billables
would grow with it.

128
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:45,510
We're holding
a pair of aces,

129
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:47,262
and this asshole
is trying to fold.

130
00:05:47,388 --> 00:05:49,139
So?
What are you going to do?

131
00:05:49,265 --> 00:05:50,140
I'm not going
to do anything.

132
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:51,475
You're going to go
through those bylaws

133
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:53,518
and you're going to find me a way
to get rid of Robert Stensland.

134
00:05:53,644 --> 00:05:55,729
No, no, no, no.
I have to go see my grandmother. Uh-uh.

135
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:57,439
She dying?

136
00:05:57,565 --> 00:05:59,399
- No.
- Cancel on her.

137
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:00,359
Are...

138
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:08,450
See the money,
wanna stay for your meal

139
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:11,870
Get another piece of pie
for your wife

140
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:15,165
Everybody wanna know
how it feel

141
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:18,293
Everybody wanna see
what it's like

142
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:21,797
I'll even eat a bean pie
I don't mind

143
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:23,507
Me and missy is so early

144
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:25,592
Busy, busy making money

145
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:26,802
All right!

146
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:31,765
All step back
I'm 'bout to dance

147
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:34,935
The greenback boogie

148
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:51,201
Hmm.

149
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:03,380
Oh.

150
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:07,300
Yeah.

151
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:09,594
Did you find anything that will help me
get rid of Stensland?

152
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,888
Uh, yeah. I think so.

153
00:07:12,014 --> 00:07:14,975
Well, if you're not here when I need it,
what good does that do me?

154
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:16,476
What? It... It's 7:15.

155
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:18,311
Hello?

156
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:40,125
Did you get it?

157
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:41,543
Picked it up yesterday.

158
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:42,961
Did you sleep with it
under your pillow?

159
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:44,421
How I sleep
is none of your concern.

160
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:45,922
Yeah, neither is
the Yankees batting order,

161
00:07:46,048 --> 00:07:47,757
but that doesn't stop me
from thinking about it.

162
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:50,635
Harvey.
Promise me you won't be cocky.

163
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:53,263
I understand what's at stake here.
I'll be perfectly humble.

164
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:54,514
Great. You ready?

165
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:57,350
You kidding?
I was born for this.

166
00:07:58,186 --> 00:07:59,978
7:45.
Nice of you to show up.

167
00:08:00,104 --> 00:08:02,147
Ha. Yeah, I was up
till 5:00 in the morning.

168
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:03,106
I'm kidding.

169
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:05,192
But Louis really wants to see you,
and I don't kid about that.

170
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:06,193
What does he want?

171
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,153
I don't know. Louis doesn't let me in
on his game plan,

172
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:09,321
and I kind of
prefer it that way.

173
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:12,073
Okay. Um... Can you tell him
that I have to see Harvey first?

174
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,074
Your call.

175
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:15,118
But, uh, if you're
going to be sleeping in your suits,

176
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:17,454
you may want to keep
a fresh one in the office.

177
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,623
- Is it that bad?
- It's worse.

178
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:21,791
Come on.

179
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:23,335
I'd just like to say
this is an honor.

180
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:26,838
I take it seriously,
and I intend to make you all proud.

181
00:08:26,964 --> 00:08:28,048
Except you, Fred.

182
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:30,175
I gave up
on making you proud in '99.

183
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:34,554
Okay. There is one more
order of business.

184
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:38,141
He's not here.

185
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:44,147
No.

186
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,108
Where is he?

187
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:50,654
- He's at his senior partner initiation.
- Let me ask you something.

188
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:55,116
What's the difference between
a senior partner and other partners?

189
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:56,701
Isn't that something
you should've been studying

190
00:08:56,827 --> 00:08:58,161
when you were pretending
to go to Harvard?

191
00:08:58,287 --> 00:08:59,287
Ah.

192
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:02,582
Okay. Senior partners,
they buy into the firm.

193
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:06,086
They share in the profits,
but they also have to put up equity.

194
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:07,879
So how much does it cost
to buy in?

195
00:09:08,005 --> 00:09:09,923
Half a million dollars?

196
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:11,132
Right now?

197
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:13,843
Harvey,
you knew what the buy-in was.

198
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,428
You knew today
was initiation.

199
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,055
How could you not
have the money?

200
00:09:17,181 --> 00:09:19,140
I didn't think
it was due today.

201
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:22,852
It's not due today,
is it?

202
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:25,146
No. It's not.

203
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:30,735
Every man in this room
fell for exactly the same thing.

204
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:31,861
Does that include you?

205
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:33,780
No. No, it doesn't.

206
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:35,282
Thank you, gentlemen.

207
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:36,950
All right.

208
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:48,545
Peanuts, gluten,
strawberries.

209
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:50,171
What is this,
a shopping list?

210
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:52,048
No. It's just a list of foods
that I'm allergic to.

211
00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:54,217
So,
when you select a venue,

212
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:56,011
these foods
are not to be on the menu.

213
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:57,345
Venue for what?

214
00:09:58,222 --> 00:09:59,598
No one told you?

215
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:01,057
- No one told me.
- Oh, drats.

216
00:10:01,183 --> 00:10:05,061
Well, a long-standing Pearson Hardman
tradition is the rookie dinner.

217
00:10:05,187 --> 00:10:07,606
- Which means you, the...
- Rookie.

218
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:08,898
- That's right.
- Yes.

219
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:11,735
Are to host a dinner
for your fellow associates.

220
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:14,237
Oh, come on.
Don't look so blue.

221
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:15,447
Oh, it's okay.
It's really easy.

222
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:18,116
All you have to do
is just find a unique location

223
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:19,868
and then coordinate
with 50 other associates.

224
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:21,870
It's really simple.
No pressure.

225
00:10:22,913 --> 00:10:23,913
And you're allergic
to chicken?

226
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,665
No, I just don't like it.

227
00:10:27,251 --> 00:10:28,543
Oh, by the way,

228
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:31,588
what was so important that you had
to see Harvey before you came to see me?

229
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:32,672
Louis,
Harvey doesn't really like me...

230
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:35,675
Can we... Can we just...
Can we just... Shut up.

231
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:36,635
Okay.

232
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:38,303
Let me just get something straight.
Okay?

233
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:40,972
When I ask you a question,
I just expect an answer.

234
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:45,060
Uh...

235
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:49,856
McKernon Motors.
I was working on the due diligence.

236
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:53,943
And why would that require you
to look at the bylaws?

237
00:10:55,863 --> 00:10:58,823
State law requires a summary be prepared
in the event of a sale.

238
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:00,825
Privately held corporations
are exempted.

239
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:02,619
Not if the sale exceeds
$150 million.

240
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:03,787
According to who?

241
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:10,377
The state's website.

242
00:11:11,545 --> 00:11:13,421
I like to be thorough.

243
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:17,842
Well, put it there, buddy.

244
00:11:18,552 --> 00:11:20,345
Serious? Embarrassing.

245
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:26,768
I understand Stensland is throwing
a large amount of legal work our way

246
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:28,895
with the McKernon Motors factory sale.

247
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:31,147
- How do you know that?
- I hear things.

248
00:11:31,273 --> 00:11:33,274
- You taking care of him?
- I am.

249
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:35,777
By the way,
for when it is due.

250
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:37,320
What's this?

251
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:40,490
It's a cashier's check
for $500,000.

252
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:43,243
You had this
the whole time?

253
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:46,538
I've had the money
since I set my sights on senior partner.

254
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:56,089
Nice of you
to finally make it.

255
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:57,465
Why does everybody
keep saying that?

256
00:11:57,591 --> 00:12:00,009
Because you're supposed to be here
when you're supposed to be here.

257
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:01,302
That doesn't seem
to apply to you.

258
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:03,304
I'm not the topic
of this conversation.

259
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:06,266
Now. What did you find me
on McKernon Motors?

260
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:08,309
The Board can't vote
for at least 24 hours

261
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:11,563
after the CEO presents a deal
involving the sale of company land.

262
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:14,065
But Stensland already
presented it to the Board.

263
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:16,151
Right.
But Stensland isn't CEO.

264
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:19,738
I wrote those bylaws myself.
He's CEO.

265
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:24,451
Hmm. Page 238,
clause 137 states,

266
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:27,579
"If the CEO dies,
an interim CEO will be appointed

267
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:29,372
"until the Board convenes
an election vote,

268
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:31,583
"which can't be called
until the next fiscal quarter."

269
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:34,002
In this case, next Thursday.

270
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:36,254
So, they can't vote him in
until Thursday?

271
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:37,714
Thursday.

272
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:39,340
Okay.

273
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:42,343
Well, prepare the due diligence
for me to take to Stensland.

274
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,095
But I don't want
anything ready to sign.

275
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:45,221
- Where are you going?
- Out.

276
00:12:45,347 --> 00:12:47,724
I have until Thursday
to find a new CEO.

277
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,184
- Huh.
- What?

278
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:54,147
Oh, nothing, uh,
it was just six hours, 1500 pages,

279
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:56,608
and I, uh...
I found your mistake.

280
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:59,152
Yeah.
You found the one mistake I made

281
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:01,988
while drafting those bylaws
a dozen years ago,

282
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:03,907
when I was
two years younger than you.

283
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:07,327
A mistake, by the way, that's going
to help me get rid of Stensland.

284
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:08,745
Mistake.

285
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:29,349
Oh, uh...
Excuse me, uh, Mr. Specter?

286
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:31,184
I was wondering
if you might need a hand sometime

287
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:33,728
with one of your, uh, matters.
Uh, any one.

288
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:35,814
- Well, Allen...
- Oh, it's Aaron.

289
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,982
I think that says it all,
don't you?

290
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:42,028
What are you doing?

291
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:43,780
I'm looking
for a restaurant.

292
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:45,323
Where did you go
for your rookie dinner?

293
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:46,741
I came into the league
a sophomore.

294
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:49,244
And you better not be
prioritizing that over McKernon Motors.

295
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:50,912
I still need something
to stall Stensland.

296
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:52,497
It's right here.

297
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:55,250
What are you
so irritated about?

298
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:57,752
I spent the day
with the top headhunter I know,

299
00:13:57,878 --> 00:14:00,672
who couldn't produce one legitimate
CEO candidate by Thursday.

300
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:02,549
What about
that Dominic Barone guy

301
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:03,675
who runs production?

302
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:05,802
You said he was responsible
for the engines,

303
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:07,220
and he clearly cares
about the workers.

304
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:08,596
No, he's not the guy.

305
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:11,599
Ah, you're scared you can't
convince him because he hates you.

306
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:13,101
I get it.
Nice try.

307
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:14,561
You know you can't
host your dinner there.

308
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:17,564
That's a
Wachtell Lipton Kline restaurant.

309
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,065
Okay, fine.

310
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:21,150
What about this place?

311
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:23,361
Yeah, that would be great.
If it was 2004.

312
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:26,906
Oh, my God.
What does any of this matter? God.

313
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:31,494
See that guy over there
by the fax?

314
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:33,913
Take a good look.

315
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,084
He's never
going to make partner.

316
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:41,838
Okay. Let me guess.
Because he threw a lousy rookie dinner.

317
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:44,090
No.
Because he doesn't get it.

318
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:45,133
Get what?

319
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:48,928
He doesn't get that doing good work
isn't the whole job.

320
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:51,973
Part of getting it is that
things like the dinner actually matter,

321
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:53,808
even when you don't think they do.

322
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:55,310
Look, you were giving me shit
this morning

323
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:56,477
because I come and go
when I want to.

324
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:58,354
You know why I can do that?

325
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,440
Because when I got here,
I dominated.

326
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:02,859
They thought I worked
a hundred hours a day.

327
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:05,361
Now,
no matter what time I get in,

328
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:08,489
nobody questions my ability
to get the job done.

329
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:10,074
Get it through your head.

330
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,076
First impressions last.

331
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:13,745
If you start
behind the eight ball,

332
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:16,205
you'll never get in front.

333
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:27,550
Hey. You busy?

334
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:30,845
It's 7:00.
I'm not here because I like the view.

335
00:15:30,971 --> 00:15:31,930
And don't misunderstand me.

336
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:34,349
When I say the view,
I'm referring to your face.

337
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:35,892
That's funny.
Because I'm hideous.

338
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:38,227
- What's up?
- You're a foodie, right?

339
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:39,270
Why do you say that?

340
00:15:39,396 --> 00:15:40,939
Because you're the only person
I've ever seen order

341
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:43,274
a shrimp, red pepper,
and goat cheese pizza.

342
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,484
Well, right,
but without the pepper,

343
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,736
what connects the goat cheese
and the shrimp?

344
00:15:46,862 --> 00:15:47,695
I'm a foodie.

345
00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:50,907
Okay. So, I need your help finding
a restaurant for the rookie dinner.

346
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:52,200
Well, that's unfortunate.

347
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:54,494
But I'm swamped, and I don't have time
to teach you about cuisine.

348
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,663
What? No. Don't make me remind you
that you owe me one.

349
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:57,622
How is that?

350
00:15:57,748 --> 00:16:00,083
You told Louis I was working
on Harvey's case before his.

351
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:01,292
Because you told me to.

352
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:03,294
Well, now, I'm telling you
to help me with my dinner.

353
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:05,171
- Mmm.
- You... Okay.

354
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:06,297
Good luck with that.

355
00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:08,967
Not going to help me
with my dinner.

356
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:10,885
Now,
I'm talking to myself.

357
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:15,181
Yeah. Grammy.

358
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:17,183
No, I told you I was coming.

359
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:19,894
I'm... I'm on my way.
Okay. Yeah.

360
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:26,109
Um... Fifteen minutes.

361
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:27,777
Okay. Bye.
Hey, what are you...

362
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:31,197
Okay.
What was that for?

363
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:32,240
If you cared about me,

364
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:34,409
you would have told me
what Trevor was up to a long time ago.

365
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:36,119
I was trying to protect you.

366
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:39,914
How is hiding the fact that my boyfriend
is selling weed protecting me?

367
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,874
You want to know the truth?

368
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:44,627
Your boyfriend also happens to be
my best friend. All right?

369
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:46,004
I didn't feel like
ratting him out.

370
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:47,255
If you were
really his friend,

371
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:49,340
you wouldn't just stand by
and let him throw his life away.

372
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:50,550
Let him?

373
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:53,011
Let... I never let Trevor do anything.
Have you met him?

374
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:55,263
Trevor listens to you,
and he needs you right now.

375
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:56,431
Oh, my God.

376
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:58,599
He is throwing
his life away.

377
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:00,727
And you ditched us.

378
00:17:01,895 --> 00:17:03,062
Both.

379
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:07,400
Like we didn't mean
anything to you.

380
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:14,532
I'm late.

381
00:17:34,928 --> 00:17:37,305
Louis.
What are you doing here?

382
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:39,599
Hi. Uh, Stensland called.

383
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:42,310
Apparently,
the diligence wasn't proceeding apace.

384
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:43,352
He called you?

385
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:45,313
Yeah, he called me. I called him.
What's the difference?

386
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:47,398
The paperwork was taking too long,
and I got it done.

387
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:50,109
I suggest you stay the hell away
from my client.

388
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:53,029
Harvey. Glad you could make it.
We are about to sign the papers.

389
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:54,197
I got word
back at the office.

390
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:57,492
I just came to see
how Louis was getting around the bylaws.

391
00:17:58,452 --> 00:18:00,078
I don't know.

392
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:01,454
Ah...

393
00:18:02,706 --> 00:18:03,790
I'm at somewhat of a loss.

394
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:06,626
Robert, I'm sorry. This is
what was holding up your due diligence.

395
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:08,586
Technically,
you're still interim CEO

396
00:18:08,712 --> 00:18:10,630
until the Board
votes you in on Thursday.

397
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:12,256
If protocol isn't followed,
it leaves you

398
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:14,592
- with huge litigation exposure.
- That's right.

399
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:18,304
Well, I imagine we should,
uh, hold off, then.

400
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:20,139
Please don't blame Louis.
It's my fault.

401
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:22,809
We usually have senior partners
oversee transactions like this

402
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:25,186
because junior partners,
they tend to miss things.

403
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:27,105
- See you Thursday?
- One second.

404
00:18:27,731 --> 00:18:31,025
Uh, just so you know, you were
a junior partner until recently.

405
00:18:31,151 --> 00:18:32,527
There's a reason
I'm not anymore.

406
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:34,654
Okay. Take it easy.

407
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:37,198
So what if you took
a trip to Russia with another man?

408
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:39,450
I mean, that was before
you met Grandpa Jimmy, right?

409
00:18:39,576 --> 00:18:41,953
He didn't care
it was before I met him.

410
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:43,663
Never shut up about it.

411
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:45,331
So, what was
this other guy's name?

412
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:47,625
Gregory Mind-Your-Own-Business.

413
00:18:47,751 --> 00:18:48,709
Ooh.

414
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:50,795
So, Michael,
this has been fun.

415
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:52,922
Now, why don't you stop
beating around the bush

416
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:54,507
and tell me
what's going on?

417
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,470
Trevor.

418
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:02,390
It's Trevor.
It's always Trevor.

419
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:05,601
He's gotten himself
into some really bad... stuff.

420
00:19:05,727 --> 00:19:07,311
And I think he needs my help
to get out of it.

421
00:19:07,437 --> 00:19:09,772
But I've been
under so much pressure.

422
00:19:09,898 --> 00:19:11,691
And I know you've always
told me to be there...

423
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:13,568
- Yeah, no. Listen to me.
...for the people in my life.

424
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:14,861
Screw Trevor.

425
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:16,779
- What?
- You're moving forward.

426
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:18,239
And he'll do
whatever he can

427
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:19,866
to keep you
where you are.

428
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:21,576
- Yeah, but he...
- But no buts.

429
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:23,452
That kid is an anchor.

430
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:25,037
You need to cut him loose.

431
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,958
- Whoa.
- You owe me fifty bucks.

432
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:43,014
What's going on
with Robert Stensland?

433
00:19:44,057 --> 00:19:45,349
What did Louis tell you?

434
00:19:45,475 --> 00:19:48,561
You're not dealing with Louis. You're
dealing with me. What are you hiding?

435
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:49,729
Nothing.
I looked through the bylaws

436
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:52,190
and precluded
potential litigation.

437
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:54,400
You looked at the bylaws
for a tactical reason,

438
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:55,776
and I want to know
what it is.

439
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:02,283
I want him out.

440
00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:03,784
That is not your call.

441
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:07,371
You're an attorney. This is the
internal business of McKernon Motors.

442
00:20:07,497 --> 00:20:09,081
Look. McKernon had a plan.

443
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,791
And I didn't spend
a decade shaping it

444
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:12,251
to let this fool
throw it away.

445
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:13,211
McKernon is dead.

446
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:14,921
So, what?
That doesn't mean the plan's no good.

447
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:16,464
You fail, we'll get fired.

448
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:17,632
He moves overseas,

449
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:19,592
our billables will be gone
in five years, anyway.

450
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:21,177
Better five years
than nothing.

451
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:22,887
You know what?
That's Stensland's attitude,

452
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:24,597
and it's a losing one.

453
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:28,601
Harvey. I don't think
you have any business

454
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:30,937
telling that man
how to run his company.

455
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:34,106
But I know you don't have any business
telling me how to run mine.

456
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:35,650
You are a senior partner.

457
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:37,944
You are not
a gunslinger anymore.

458
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,487
Back off Stensland,

459
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:41,322
and close the deal.

460
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:57,463
I need you to prepare the draft
CEO candidate speech for Thursday.

461
00:20:57,589 --> 00:20:58,798
I thought you were
supposed to back off.

462
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:00,258
Yeah, I'm supposed
to do a lot of things.

463
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:02,218
I'll call you with the plan
on my way back.

464
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:03,261
From where?

465
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:05,846
From convincing the man who hates me
to do what I say.

466
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:09,642
Oh, right. You mean the guy I suggested
you go to in the first place.

467
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:11,644
Do you remember that whole "getting it"
thing I was talking to you about?

468
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:12,687
What, I can't even gloat?

469
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:14,605
Gloating's fine.
You just have to not suck at it.

470
00:21:14,731 --> 00:21:19,193
Ah. Okay.
Thank you. So much.

471
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:20,611
That hurt.

472
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:27,410
Hey, Ross.

473
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:29,537
You left your searches
for the rookie dinner on your computer.

474
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:32,081
Why don't you just save time
and take us to Fridays?

475
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:33,874
Ooh. Ooh.
Somebody's mad.

476
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:36,711
Devon, looking on my computer
is a violation

477
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:39,797
of exactly seven hostile workplace
environment statutes.

478
00:21:39,923 --> 00:21:41,924
What are you going to do,
sue me?

479
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:44,385
No, no, no, no. I'm just going
to use it as legal cover

480
00:21:44,511 --> 00:21:46,095
if I decide to kick your ass.

481
00:21:56,231 --> 00:21:57,690
Dominic.

482
00:21:58,191 --> 00:21:59,025
Harvey, what are you
doing here?

483
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:00,735
Our contract's good
for two more years.

484
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:02,778
I need a word.
In private.

485
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,156
Excuse me, Joe.

486
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:07,992
Make it fast because this is a place
where people actually work for a living.

487
00:22:08,118 --> 00:22:09,702
Well, keep in mind
people are watching.

488
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:11,537
Just try to keep
your expression neutral.

489
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:13,706
They don't teach deceptive tactics
where I come from.

490
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:15,291
Then, you're going to learn
under fire.

491
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:16,792
Stensland
is shutting you down.

492
00:22:16,918 --> 00:22:18,461
What? Why?

493
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:22,298
For money. He's got a buyer
for the land under the factory.

494
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:24,592
Why are you coming to me?

495
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:26,052
Because the only way
to stop him

496
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:27,928
is for you
to challenge him as CEO.

497
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:29,263
What? Are you crazy?

498
00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:30,431
You've got
a management title.

499
00:22:30,557 --> 00:22:31,891
That I choose
not to identify with.

500
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:32,933
You run the factory.

501
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:35,770
Which I've never left because I've got
no taste for boardroom politics.

502
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:36,979
You've been here
since day one.

503
00:22:37,105 --> 00:22:38,522
You know the product
inside out.

504
00:22:38,648 --> 00:22:40,274
These workers...
They respect you.

505
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,109
Phew.
That's a lot of smoke.

506
00:22:42,235 --> 00:22:43,694
How many people
did you go to before me?

507
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:45,112
- Seven.
- Right.

508
00:22:45,238 --> 00:22:47,239
I never said you were
my prom queen.

509
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:48,991
Look, I want a win.
Okay?

510
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:49,950
I went to those other people

511
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:51,952
because they were better suited
to get past the Board.

512
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:53,746
Not better suited
for the job.

513
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:56,082
Those are the facts,
whether you like it or not.

514
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:58,042
- And why should I trust you?
- Because if you don't,

515
00:22:58,168 --> 00:23:00,294
there aren't any jobs left
to negotiate over.

516
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:02,380
You and the factory,
you're finished.

517
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:18,270
What are you working on?

518
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:20,314
Um, nothing.
Just some stuff for Harvey. Why?

519
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:24,276
Wrap it up. Louis Litt wants to see you.
This time, he doesn't want to wait.

520
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:39,583
Furthermore,
I feel that with the proper strategic

521
00:23:39,709 --> 00:23:42,420
and synergistic alliances,
moving forward, we can...

522
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:44,588
I have to actually believe
what you're saying.

523
00:23:44,714 --> 00:23:46,507
They're just platitudes
that don't mean anything.

524
00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:49,927
Yes, they do. Synergistic alliances
mean you form relationships

525
00:23:50,053 --> 00:23:51,679
to get the costs down
and your product out.

526
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:52,805
This is never going to work.

527
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:54,974
Well, it better goddamn work.
My ass is on the line.

528
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,725
- What about my ass?
- If it wasn't attached

529
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:59,437
to your thick head, maybe we wouldn't
be having this problem.

530
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:03,399
I'm sorry I'm not as well-practiced
at corporate double-speak as you'd like,

531
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:06,277
but I've been busting my ass
on this for two hours.

532
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:07,653
So if you're not happy
with my progress,

533
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:10,030
then why don't you
get the hell out?

534
00:24:12,325 --> 00:24:14,869
He doesn't leave
without getting it.

535
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:21,292
Son of a bitch.

536
00:24:24,504 --> 00:24:26,380
You're not going
to pick it up?

537
00:24:26,506 --> 00:24:28,340
Why should I?
You're never going to get it.

538
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:30,176
You're right.

539
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:34,263
Hey, can I ask you something?

540
00:24:36,391 --> 00:24:39,059
What's your
engine design philosophy?

541
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:43,230
Perfectly balanced power
and durability.

542
00:24:43,356 --> 00:24:46,734
Okay. Why don't you favor power,
like Bronson does?

543
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,986
Because drivers are limited
to eight engines a season,

544
00:24:49,112 --> 00:24:50,196
and Bronson's don't last.

545
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:52,448
What, so, you would stack your engines
up against Bronson's, then?

546
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:54,909
Uh, I have stacked my engines up
against Bronson

547
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:57,328
and everyone else's in the world,
and mine win.

548
00:24:57,454 --> 00:24:58,287
Why?

549
00:24:58,413 --> 00:25:01,665
Because I make sure they're designed
better than anyone else's in the world

550
00:25:01,791 --> 00:25:04,168
from the day that they're conceived
to the day they're born.

551
00:25:04,294 --> 00:25:05,586
And that's why
people buy them.

552
00:25:05,712 --> 00:25:07,379
You're goddamn right.

553
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:09,798
Then that's the speech
you're going to give.

554
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:23,604
Good lawyer,
bad lawyer, baby.

555
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:24,980
Worked like a charm.

556
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:27,441
Come on.
You know you want it.

557
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:29,527
There it is.

558
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:32,613
I told you. If someone doesn't like you,
use it against them.

559
00:25:32,739 --> 00:25:34,073
Or in this case, for them.

560
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:35,866
I didn't do this
for Dominic.

561
00:25:35,992 --> 00:25:37,618
I did it
to get rid of Stensland.

562
00:25:37,744 --> 00:25:40,663
Wow. Have you ever considered
writing for Hallmark?

563
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:43,374
- Many times. Yeah.
- Wow.

564
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,875
Congrats.

565
00:25:46,169 --> 00:25:47,169
You're good.

566
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:03,269
- Hey.
- I said don't be late.

567
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:05,062
Late? I'm not late.

568
00:26:05,188 --> 00:26:06,981
When you host
your dinner here,

569
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:09,275
not being late means
getting here a half hour early.

570
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:11,986
Aha. So, what made you
change your mind?

571
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:15,114
The food items are samples
to help you select your menu.

572
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:18,701
So since I could never really afford
to eat here myself...

573
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:21,120
Hmm.

574
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:23,956
- Hmm.
- Okay. Start there.

575
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:25,374
- Try that?
- Yes.

576
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,626
- It looks kind of funny.
- So does an eggroll.

577
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:29,128
I don't accept that premise.

578
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:30,629
You want my help or not?

579
00:26:38,054 --> 00:26:40,055
- Oh, what is that?
- Squid.

580
00:26:40,181 --> 00:26:41,390
I think it's still moving.

581
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:47,521
That's what I'm talking about.

582
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:49,189
Mmm.

583
00:26:49,316 --> 00:26:53,235
I don't get it. How do you have
no appreciation for fine food?

584
00:26:53,987 --> 00:26:56,071
We didn't have a lot of money
growing up.

585
00:26:56,197 --> 00:26:57,615
I don't know.
I guess I'm just comfortable

586
00:26:57,741 --> 00:26:59,533
with what I'm comfortable with.

587
00:26:59,659 --> 00:27:02,036
That is the exact opposite of me.
I've...

588
00:27:02,162 --> 00:27:04,455
I've always loved
new experiences.

589
00:27:04,581 --> 00:27:05,706
And your parents?

590
00:27:05,832 --> 00:27:08,000
- They're loaded.
- Mmm.

591
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:10,210
So then what do you need
a free meal for?

592
00:27:10,337 --> 00:27:12,630
I want to live on
what I make.

593
00:27:12,756 --> 00:27:14,173
Hmm.

594
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,717
- What?
- Nothing.

595
00:27:16,843 --> 00:27:18,427
I was just thinking
about Dominic for a second.

596
00:27:18,553 --> 00:27:21,472
And then, I realized
this is the first time in weeks

597
00:27:21,598 --> 00:27:23,307
that I haven't
been thinking about work.

598
00:27:23,433 --> 00:27:25,476
That's what new experiences
do for you.

599
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:29,605
Being a foodie doesn't mean
only liking fancy food.

600
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:31,106
It means having the courage
to try it.

601
00:27:31,232 --> 00:27:33,150
And then you get to serve
what you like.

602
00:27:33,276 --> 00:27:36,278
Except strawberries,
peanuts, gluten, and chicken.

603
00:27:36,404 --> 00:27:37,696
Okay. Why not those things?

604
00:27:37,822 --> 00:27:38,906
Because Louis is an asshole.

605
00:27:39,032 --> 00:27:41,575
If you can't serve things just
because Louis is an asshole,

606
00:27:41,701 --> 00:27:43,285
you're not going to have
that many choices.

607
00:27:43,411 --> 00:27:45,162
Good point.

608
00:27:51,294 --> 00:27:53,379
So, what really made you
change your mind?

609
00:27:55,715 --> 00:27:57,216
Pity.

610
00:27:58,593 --> 00:27:59,927
I'll take it.

611
00:28:10,897 --> 00:28:13,732
Driver,
taketh me to Williamsburg.

612
00:28:16,444 --> 00:28:19,113
It's Jenny. Trevor told me
you talked to him,

613
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:21,865
and he's going to stop.
Thanks, Mike.

614
00:28:21,991 --> 00:28:25,285
Hold on.
Change of destination.

615
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:29,998
- Trevor.
- What are you doing here?

616
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:34,461
Can we talk for a minute?

617
00:28:35,004 --> 00:28:36,046
Yeah.

618
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:43,887
I know you lied to Jenny
about us talking.

619
00:28:44,013 --> 00:28:45,973
You never should've told her
I was dealing in the first place.

620
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:48,767
I never should've had to hide it
in the first place.

621
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:51,770
Look, Trevor.

622
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:54,648
You don't need to be
dealing for a living, man.

623
00:28:54,774 --> 00:28:55,858
You can make something
of yourself.

624
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:56,817
Is that what you came
here to tell me?

625
00:28:56,943 --> 00:28:59,653
You've got real software clients, man.
Stick to them.

626
00:28:59,779 --> 00:29:02,448
Jesus.
You believed that crap?

627
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:04,575
I don't have
any software clients.

628
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:06,618
Jesus,
you're as naive as Jenny.

629
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:10,873
Look. If you need some kind
of transition money or something...

630
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:12,750
What? How?

631
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:14,418
Does it matter?

632
00:29:14,544 --> 00:29:17,755
What matters
is that you don't help me out.

633
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:19,006
Okay? I help you out.

634
00:29:19,132 --> 00:29:22,468
And I'm not interested
in transitioning into anything.

635
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:24,011
Okay.

636
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:26,638
But the least you could do
is be honest with Jenny.

637
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:28,056
That's what this
is all about.

638
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:29,600
- Yeah.
- You always liked her.

639
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:32,227
I think she deserves
to know the truth.

640
00:29:32,645 --> 00:29:35,314
You always thought
you were better than me.

641
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,357
Maybe that's because I am.

642
00:29:48,203 --> 00:29:49,745
Come on.

643
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:02,508
We're done.

644
00:30:03,259 --> 00:30:05,052
Don't let the door hit you.

645
00:30:16,689 --> 00:30:17,815
You called Dominic?

646
00:30:17,941 --> 00:30:19,233
He's waiting for us outside.

647
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:20,818
He's got the speech down?

648
00:30:20,944 --> 00:30:21,944
Yeah, he's got it down.

649
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:24,363
He better.
I'm taking a big risk on him.

650
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:27,074
You're taking
a risk on him?

651
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,242
Look at him.

652
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:29,576
He's scared out of his mind.

653
00:30:29,702 --> 00:30:32,162
He's leaving his comfort zone
because you convinced him to.

654
00:30:32,288 --> 00:30:33,163
So?

655
00:30:33,289 --> 00:30:36,041
So, maybe
some words of encouragement.

656
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:39,545
The best way to help Dominic
is not to let him second-guess himself.

657
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:41,713
The most important asset
an attorney has

658
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,633
is his ability
to always be self-assured.

659
00:30:45,176 --> 00:30:47,427
Okay.
Here's what's going to happen.

660
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:50,597
It's standard for me to prep
the Board on any voting procedure.

661
00:30:50,723 --> 00:30:52,224
When do I speak?

662
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:53,851
When I tell you to.

663
00:30:53,977 --> 00:30:55,185
Let's go.

664
00:30:58,356 --> 00:31:01,024
I suggested to Stensland
you be there to convince the Board

665
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:03,402
that production won't be hurt
by an overseas move.

666
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:05,696
It helps your credibility
that he brought you here,

667
00:31:05,822 --> 00:31:08,574
and it will hurt his
when you challenge him for CEO.

668
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:14,872
Look, it's natural
to be nervous. Okay?

669
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:16,707
Just remember,
you know your stuff.

670
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:18,041
The Board's
never loved Stensland,

671
00:31:18,167 --> 00:31:19,585
and I'm here to back you up.

672
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:20,878
Okay.

673
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:30,387
Robert?

674
00:31:31,848 --> 00:31:33,265
Harvey.

675
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:36,476
You know, I have to admit,
I almost didn't see it coming.

676
00:31:36,603 --> 00:31:37,644
Excuse me?

677
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:41,064
It was the delay in the due diligence.
It just didn't smell right.

678
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:42,024
So the only thing
it could be

679
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:45,652
was that you were going after
my CEO appointment.

680
00:31:45,778 --> 00:31:49,197
So since I'm still within my rights
to move a Board meeting, I did.

681
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:51,533
I was voted in
today at noon.

682
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:54,870
And tomorrow, the Board will ratify
the sale of the factory.

683
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:57,372
And now,
I'm firing your firm.

684
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:01,084
And I'm firing you.

685
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:03,921
Try the croissants,
gentlemen.

686
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:05,255
Marmalade's fantastic.

687
00:32:16,351 --> 00:32:17,559
What are we going to do?

688
00:32:17,685 --> 00:32:19,102
You're going to go
through those bylaws again

689
00:32:19,228 --> 00:32:21,605
and see if there isn't another way
we can stop this sale.

690
00:32:21,731 --> 00:32:23,899
I'm talking about Dominic.
He just lost his job.

691
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:26,151
He's a grown man.
He made a decision.

692
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:27,819
Because you convinced him to.

693
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:28,862
Based on your idea.

694
00:32:28,988 --> 00:32:30,656
Which I recall
you pushed on me at the time.

695
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:32,407
Because I thought
it would work at the time.

696
00:32:32,533 --> 00:32:33,909
Well, it didn't.
What do you want me to do about it?

697
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:35,327
Help him.

698
00:32:36,162 --> 00:32:37,621
He's not dying.
He lost his job.

699
00:32:37,747 --> 00:32:38,956
He has to look
for another one.

700
00:32:39,082 --> 00:32:41,208
Which, if he hadn't chosen to fight
for his company in the first place,

701
00:32:41,334 --> 00:32:42,626
would have happened,
anyway.

702
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:43,877
Now,
show me that you get it,

703
00:32:44,003 --> 00:32:45,379
go back through
those bylaws again,

704
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:48,298
and see if you missed anything.
Okay?

705
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:53,637
So this is what happens when you promote
the wrong guy to senior partner.

706
00:32:53,763 --> 00:32:56,056
If you hadn't gone to Stensland behind
my back, this wouldn't have happened.

707
00:32:56,182 --> 00:32:57,015
You don't know that.

708
00:32:57,141 --> 00:32:59,226
And I'm a member of this firm
just as much as you.

709
00:32:59,352 --> 00:33:00,727
I think we both agree
that you're a member.

710
00:33:00,853 --> 00:33:02,229
For your information,
I didn't even...

711
00:33:02,355 --> 00:33:03,313
Louis.

712
00:33:03,856 --> 00:33:05,482
Harvey, eye on the ball.

713
00:33:05,608 --> 00:33:07,859
The issue here
is you tried to torpedo a client...

714
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:10,404
The client is McKernon Motors,
not Stensland.

715
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:11,947
You didn't let me finish.

716
00:33:12,073 --> 00:33:14,116
Without my consent.

717
00:33:14,701 --> 00:33:17,911
That trumps the "who's the client" part.
Louis?

718
00:33:18,037 --> 00:33:19,663
Go to Stensland,
repair the relationship.

719
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:20,914
Say what you have to.

720
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,332
Call it a misunderstanding.

721
00:33:22,458 --> 00:33:25,293
Promise Harvey
is no longer involved.

722
00:33:26,212 --> 00:33:27,546
Consider it done.

723
00:33:31,926 --> 00:33:33,051
Wait a second.

724
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:34,761
Louis didn't go to Stensland
behind my back.

725
00:33:34,887 --> 00:33:37,222
You sent him there
to hedge your bets.

726
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:40,809
Either Stensland's out

727
00:33:40,935 --> 00:33:42,561
and we double our billings,

728
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:44,521
or you have
plausible deniability

729
00:33:44,647 --> 00:33:46,690
and he stays with the firm.

730
00:33:46,816 --> 00:33:49,317
Wow.
Am I smart enough to do that?

731
00:33:50,403 --> 00:33:52,446
If I win, I look great.

732
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:54,322
If Louis wins,
he looks great.

733
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:55,907
Either way,

734
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:57,993
you look great.

735
00:33:58,119 --> 00:34:00,412
You mean the firm looks great.

736
00:34:00,955 --> 00:34:04,499
Harvey, what I've been trying to get
into your head is that you bought in.

737
00:34:04,625 --> 00:34:06,209
You are the firm.

738
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:10,964
That's it.

739
00:34:13,843 --> 00:34:15,093
Mike. Follow me.

740
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:16,928
I need you to go talk
to Dominic.

741
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:18,096
What? Why?

742
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:19,389
Stensland's already CEO.

743
00:34:19,515 --> 00:34:21,850
That won't matter
if we just buy the damn company.

744
00:34:21,976 --> 00:34:22,934
What?

745
00:34:26,189 --> 00:34:28,065
Why are you still working?

746
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:32,152
This is one of my creations.

747
00:34:32,278 --> 00:34:34,446
I'm not leaving it
unfinished.

748
00:34:35,364 --> 00:34:37,616
What the hell
do you want?

749
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:39,409
I'd be happy to tell you
if you put that wrench down.

750
00:34:39,535 --> 00:34:42,412
You're quick with the jokes.
I'm the guy who just got fired.

751
00:34:43,206 --> 00:34:45,373
You're right. I'm sorry.

752
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:48,543
But what would you say
if I told you

753
00:34:48,669 --> 00:34:50,670
we could get your job back
and stick it to Stensland?

754
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:52,881
I'm done with Harvey
and his plans. Yeah?

755
00:34:53,007 --> 00:34:54,424
You were there.
We got fired, too.

756
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:56,343
You and Harvey
still have jobs?

757
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:59,054
He doesn't care
about anybody but himself.

758
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:01,056
Including you, Mike.

759
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:03,266
Yeah. You're probably right.

760
00:35:05,478 --> 00:35:08,897
But he did stick his neck out
to keep your company here.

761
00:35:09,023 --> 00:35:11,108
And he does have an idea
that requires your help.

762
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:14,402
So you can stay here
and call him an asshole,

763
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:17,572
or you can come with me
and we can help him.

764
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:23,203
Give me my goddamn shirt.

765
00:35:37,677 --> 00:35:39,052
You know,
it goes from zero to sixty...

766
00:35:39,178 --> 00:35:41,012
In the blink of an eye.

767
00:35:43,891 --> 00:35:46,434
Did you bring me down here
to tell me I can drive this?

768
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:49,563
Better. For $250 million dollars,
you can own it.

769
00:35:51,357 --> 00:35:52,941
McKernon Motors
is for sale?

770
00:35:53,067 --> 00:35:54,401
If we act fast.

771
00:35:54,527 --> 00:35:55,861
I'll need to see
the financials.

772
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:58,864
You put together a letter of intent,
they'll get you the financials.

773
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:01,616
You know,
their real asset is engine quality.

774
00:36:01,742 --> 00:36:03,869
I don't want to
just buy the name.

775
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:05,203
Speak of the devil.

776
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:07,205
Laurence, I'd like you to meet
the man responsible for

777
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:09,166
every McKernon Motors engine
ever built.

778
00:36:09,292 --> 00:36:11,251
Wow. Dominic Barone.
Very nice to meet you.

779
00:36:11,377 --> 00:36:13,378
Good to meet you. I'd like to show
you something if you have a minute.

780
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:14,379
Absolutely.

781
00:36:17,133 --> 00:36:18,925
So? How do we get an offer
to the Board

782
00:36:19,051 --> 00:36:21,428
before they vote
to ratify the deal tomorrow?

783
00:36:21,554 --> 00:36:22,679
You're going to go through those bylaws

784
00:36:22,805 --> 00:36:25,223
and you're going
to figure something out.

785
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:27,601
I don't have to look through them
to figure it out because I just did.

786
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:29,352
Well,
what took you so long?

787
00:36:29,478 --> 00:36:31,354
Are you trying
to look like me?

788
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,814
Wow.

789
00:36:36,944 --> 00:36:40,030
Each of you had 24 hours
to review the documents in front of you.

790
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:41,281
So at this time...

791
00:36:41,407 --> 00:36:44,784
Uh, excuse me. Excuse me. What...
What is he doing here?

792
00:36:44,911 --> 00:36:45,911
I'm sorry.
I'm going to take care of this.

793
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:46,995
No, no, no. I will.

794
00:36:47,121 --> 00:36:50,081
You gentlemen have no right
to attend this meeting.

795
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:51,291
Actually, we do.

796
00:36:51,417 --> 00:36:53,960
The bylaw states
that any original employee

797
00:36:54,086 --> 00:36:56,504
has the right to petition the Board
any time they meet.

798
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:59,883
Dominic Barone
has assigned that right to me.

799
00:37:00,009 --> 00:37:00,967
He was fired.

800
00:37:01,093 --> 00:37:02,594
He no longer
has that right.

801
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,888
Per section 17-5.C,

802
00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:06,681
Dominic wasn't given
three days' notice.

803
00:37:06,807 --> 00:37:09,059
So, technically,
he wasn't fired.

804
00:37:09,185 --> 00:37:12,354
Which is why I do have the right
to urge the Board to accept

805
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,981
the offer for the purchase
of McKernon Motors.

806
00:37:15,107 --> 00:37:17,150
Now, I can tell you
that this offer

807
00:37:17,276 --> 00:37:19,361
will keep manufacturing here
and save jobs,

808
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:22,739
while retaining the flagship engine
that put this company on the map.

809
00:37:22,865 --> 00:37:23,698
But I don't have to,

810
00:37:23,824 --> 00:37:26,576
because it happens to be
for way more goddamn money

811
00:37:26,702 --> 00:37:29,037
than the one
in front of you right now.

812
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:32,582
Hey, Bob. How are you?

813
00:37:35,044 --> 00:37:38,213
It's funny how you held out on me
on that proper notice exception.

814
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:39,422
I didn't hold out.

815
00:37:39,548 --> 00:37:40,757
I made that up
on the spot.

816
00:37:40,883 --> 00:37:42,217
Really? On the spot?

817
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:43,551
You remember that
"getting it" stuff?

818
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:45,136
I know, right?
I'm getting it.

819
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:47,722
Well, I was going to say that,
but now, you ruined it.

820
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:51,351
That's one thing
you definitely get.

821
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,144
How to ruin it.

822
00:37:53,562 --> 00:37:54,646
How to ruin it.

823
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:56,398
I heard that.

824
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:05,699
Nice job, Mike.

825
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,788
I have to admit.
You don't suck.

826
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:15,458
I wish I could say
the same for you.

827
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:19,587
Time to pay the piper.

828
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:23,383
Just so you know, I took the liberty
of ordering some really expensive wines.

829
00:38:23,509 --> 00:38:25,635
Hope that's okay.

830
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:41,192
Sorry, sir. But the check's been paid
for in full by a Harvey Specter.

831
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:48,783
There, uh, might have been
some gluten in the ravioli.

832
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:56,541
I hear McKernon Motors
is getting a new owner.

833
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:58,084
We're not only
handling the sale,

834
00:38:58,210 --> 00:39:00,420
but with the expansion plan
they're putting in place,

835
00:39:00,546 --> 00:39:01,838
our billables should double.

836
00:39:01,964 --> 00:39:02,964
Nicely done.

837
00:39:04,133 --> 00:39:05,383
I did it for the firm.

838
00:39:33,829 --> 00:39:36,122
What are you doing here?

839
00:39:38,292 --> 00:39:39,709
You were right.

840
00:39:39,835 --> 00:39:43,421
I should never have kept it from you
that Trevor was dealing all that time.

841
00:39:45,257 --> 00:39:46,633
Well, I mean...

842
00:39:46,759 --> 00:39:48,593
It's, uh...

843
00:39:49,762 --> 00:39:52,389
It's all in the past,
right?

844
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:54,557
No.

845
00:39:56,477 --> 00:39:58,812
What are you
talking about?

846
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:02,232
He's lying to you.

847
00:40:05,319 --> 00:40:08,738
He's still dealing,
and I'm done with him.

848
00:40:17,706 --> 00:40:19,624
Son of a bitch.

849
00:40:22,378 --> 00:40:24,546
Well, thank you, uh,
for telling me, Mike.

850
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:26,714
No, don't. Stop.

851
00:40:29,009 --> 00:40:31,010
We're even.

852
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:34,848
That is the last time
I am ever ratting on anyone.

853
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:38,309
So if you
fall for it again,

854
00:40:40,062 --> 00:40:41,729
it's on you.

855
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:44,983
Are you angry with me?

856
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:48,820
You told me
he would listen to me.

857
00:40:48,946 --> 00:40:51,531
- I thought he would.
- Look, he didn't.

858
00:40:51,657 --> 00:40:52,866
I...

859
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:55,118
I'm sorry.

860
00:40:55,244 --> 00:40:57,495
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

861
00:41:05,045 --> 00:41:06,546
No, I can't.

862
00:41:06,672 --> 00:41:08,256
I can't.

863
00:41:08,382 --> 00:41:09,632
- What?
- No, I... I...

864
00:41:09,758 --> 00:41:12,594
I fought with him.
It's...

865
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,429
Oh, God.

866
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:16,806
This is too much.
