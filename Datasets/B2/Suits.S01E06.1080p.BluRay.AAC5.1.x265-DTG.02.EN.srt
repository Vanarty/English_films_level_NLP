1
00:00:10,593 --> 00:00:12,845
Harvey, I don't need a perp-walk
or a front-page headline.

2
00:00:12,971 --> 00:00:14,179
I just want the
person responsible.

3
00:00:14,305 --> 00:00:17,224
Then hand me the deal we just negotiated
and justice will be served.

4
00:00:19,227 --> 00:00:22,271
You know, if this were
anyone else but you,

5
00:00:22,397 --> 00:00:24,565
I wouldn't even be
giving the courtesy of this meeting.

6
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:27,359
Becky, we're both
benefiting from this.

7
00:00:27,485 --> 00:00:29,319
You've got nothing
on my clients

8
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:31,780
and I'm going
to help you get the person responsible.

9
00:00:31,906 --> 00:00:33,198
So let me just
go do that.

10
00:00:34,117 --> 00:00:35,701
You better make sure
Ms. Stone signs this.

11
00:00:35,827 --> 00:00:37,286
Otherwise,
we don't have a deal.

12
00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:38,370
How long have we
known each other?

13
00:00:38,496 --> 00:00:39,663
Since you were
in the DA's office.

14
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:42,124
Then you know
we'll have a deal.

15
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:47,212
Talk soon.

16
00:00:54,929 --> 00:00:56,638
Uh, how did it go
at the Department of Justice?

17
00:00:56,765 --> 00:00:58,140
Follow me,
you'll find out.

18
00:00:58,266 --> 00:00:59,391
I get to sit in?

19
00:00:59,517 --> 00:01:01,226
With your head down and your mouth shut.
This isn't the usual...

20
00:01:01,352 --> 00:01:02,978
- Uh...
- What are you doing?

21
00:01:03,104 --> 00:01:04,688
Quick. Act like you're
telling me something important.

22
00:01:04,814 --> 00:01:06,106
I am telling you
something important.

23
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:07,816
Oh, and then, uh,
after the injunction, you know,

24
00:01:07,942 --> 00:01:10,277
both parties decided
to reassess...

25
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,488
My God. That woman with Rachel.

26
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:14,531
I took the LSAT's
for her a couple of years ago.

27
00:01:14,657 --> 00:01:15,949
If she saw me,
she could blow my cover.

28
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:17,701
Oh, really?
And how would that go?

29
00:01:17,827 --> 00:01:20,287
"Uh, excuse me.
When I was cheating for my LSAT's,

30
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:23,290
"that was the guy who
took the test for me"? Come on.

31
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:25,959
It could go down like that.
You don't know. People say things.

32
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:28,170
Ms. Stone, correct me
if any of this is wrong.

33
00:01:28,296 --> 00:01:29,296
But you and I
both know it's not.

34
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:31,381
Please address me
and not my client, Mr. Specter.

35
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:33,300
You mean your client
who purchased $10 million

36
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:34,802
of Lunardi Pharmaceuticals?

37
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:38,097
And then, a day later,
word of their FDA approval got out

38
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:39,598
and the stock shot up
to $30 million?

39
00:01:39,724 --> 00:01:41,183
She purchased that stock
for your clients,

40
00:01:41,309 --> 00:01:43,018
Bert Kimble
and Dean Morello,

41
00:01:43,144 --> 00:01:44,853
based on a tip sheet
handed out by your clients.

42
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:47,272
An allegation that tainted
their reputation,

43
00:01:47,398 --> 00:01:49,316
yet the DOJ looked into it
and found nothing.

44
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:51,110
That doesn't mean
it didn't happen.

45
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:53,987
I'll turn your client
over in person. No handcuffs.

46
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:55,781
It will be
a country club prison.

47
00:01:55,907 --> 00:01:58,200
And I'll make sure that she's processed
as gently as possible.

48
00:01:58,326 --> 00:02:01,203
As long as she admits that she made
this trade of her own accord.

49
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:04,164
It's a crappy deal
wrapped in pretty paper.

50
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,083
Why aren't we dealing
with the Department of Justice?

51
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:08,836
Because the DOJ wanted
to put you behind bars for seven years,

52
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:10,879
and I got them down
to 11 months.

53
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:16,051
Look, it's a great
deal. You're going to sign it.

54
00:02:16,177 --> 00:02:18,137
You're going to serve
your year in prison.

55
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:19,471
And every night,
when you climb into your bunk,

56
00:02:19,597 --> 00:02:20,889
you're going to thank
your lucky stars

57
00:02:21,015 --> 00:02:23,892
that Harvey Specter
negotiated on your behalf.

58
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:31,567
Nobody is ever going
to believe me,

59
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:35,404
and I don't have the resources
to fight this thing forever.

60
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:38,240
So I'll sign the
goddamn deal.

61
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:44,872
But I'm not
thanking anybody.

62
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:50,335
Harvey?

63
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:52,629
You came through.

64
00:02:52,755 --> 00:02:55,674
My company's reputation means
everything to me.

65
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,176
Thank you.

66
00:02:57,635 --> 00:02:58,719
So I trust we
won't be hearing

67
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:01,263
from the Department
of Justice again?

68
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:02,472
Unless you plan
on inviting them

69
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:05,267
to the company's
Christmas party, Bert, no.

70
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:09,396
I told Morello you could fix
this for us. Thank you, Harvey.

71
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:15,485
Reality's
starting to sink in,

72
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:17,404
and Gabby's a little
wound-up right now.

73
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:18,906
Let's, uh...
Let's give her a minute.

74
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:22,784
I've got the pretty papers in my office
for you to look over.

75
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:24,995
Keep an eye on her.

76
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:35,631
You're here to make sure
I don't change my mind about the deal?

77
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:37,007
No, I...

78
00:03:38,426 --> 00:03:39,426
Would you?

79
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:42,930
You know, my father
was a teacher.

80
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:46,350
He worked hard,
followed the rules.

81
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:50,020
Last year, the district cut his pension
to save their budget.

82
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:52,564
I went to Wall Street
so I could make some money

83
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:55,317
before getting into
teaching, myself.

84
00:03:58,446 --> 00:04:00,030
I never thought
I'd have to worry

85
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:02,491
if they let convicted
felons teach.

86
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:08,163
Could I get you
some water or something?

87
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:12,542
Oh...

88
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:16,838
I'm just going to
get you some water.

89
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:23,178
- Hey.
- Hey.

90
00:04:23,304 --> 00:04:24,596
- I got it.
- Thanks.

91
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:27,349
So, uh, that girl
you were with earlier.

92
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:28,517
She a friend of yours?

93
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:31,311
Teresa? Yeah, she used to
be a paralegal here.

94
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,146
We were
pretty close.

95
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:34,273
She worked at
Pearson Hardman?

96
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:36,692
Mmm-hmm. And I just had
the unique pleasure

97
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:39,903
of giving her the summer intern tour
for prospective employees.

98
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:41,029
- Really?
- Yeah.

99
00:04:41,155 --> 00:04:42,572
She's in her second year
of Harvard Law.

100
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:44,533
Meeting with
the partners as we speak.

101
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:46,034
- Huh!
- I know.

102
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,119
We used to do
everything together.

103
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:48,328
And now,
if she gets this job,

104
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:51,123
she will technically
be my boss.

105
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,875
Oh, my God.
I'm so sorry, Rachel.

106
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:55,294
If you need to
talk about it, or...

107
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,337
No. Not now, thanks.

108
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:59,131
No. No, no, no.

109
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:00,340
What?

110
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:02,509
She's gone.

111
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:07,514
See the money, wanna stay
for your meal

112
00:05:07,765 --> 00:05:11,018
Get another piece of pie
for your wife

113
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:14,187
Everybody wanna know
how it feel

114
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:17,774
Everybody wanna see
what it's like

115
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:21,111
I'll even eat a bean pie
I don't mind

116
00:05:21,237 --> 00:05:22,946
Me and missy is so early

117
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:24,740
Busy, busy making money

118
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:26,199
All right!

119
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:30,704
All step back
I'm 'bout to dance

120
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:34,041
The greenback boogie

121
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:39,338
You left her alone
to get her a water?

122
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:40,797
What, she didn't
want a latte?

123
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:41,798
I was trying
to be helpful.

124
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:43,342
You were very
helpful. To her.

125
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:44,426
You didn't see her,
Harvey.

126
00:05:44,552 --> 00:05:45,886
She was scared.
She was a wreck.

127
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:47,220
Maybe that had to
do with the fact

128
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:49,139
that she was about to go to prison
for 11 months.

129
00:05:49,265 --> 00:05:51,224
I think she was having
the reaction of an innocent woman.

130
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:52,309
And what was
telling you that?

131
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:54,269
Your years of
investigative experience?

132
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:56,480
No, I just...
I listened to her. That's all.

133
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:57,606
Let me tell you
something, okay?

134
00:05:57,732 --> 00:05:59,191
Just because a pretty girl
tells you a story,

135
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:02,069
doesn't mean it's true.
If she'd gone to trial,

136
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:03,987
the burden of proof
would be on the prosecution.

137
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:06,365
Yet her own lawyer
told her to take the deal.

138
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:09,368
Not to mention that innocent
people don't run.

139
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:14,831
I think this fell out of her purse.
I found it here.

140
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,835
Why are you
telling me this now?

141
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:20,128
Because you were
mad at me before.

142
00:06:20,254 --> 00:06:23,173
So your answer to that is to delay
giving me important information?

143
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:24,216
Well, when you
put it like that...

144
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:26,635
Okay. I've got to
smooth things over with the DOJ.

145
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:28,136
That phone is
our only lead.

146
00:06:28,262 --> 00:06:29,888
Try not to lose it
before I get back.

147
00:06:30,014 --> 00:06:31,056
- Ah.
- Okay?

148
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:44,820
Becky, there's been a slight hiccup
on the Gabby Stone business.

149
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:45,862
I don't want to hear about any hiccups.

150
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:47,072
She sign the deal or not?

151
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:50,867
Well, she was about to. My associate
left her alone for a second.

152
00:06:50,993 --> 00:06:52,119
She took off.

153
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:54,037
Gabby Stone's in the wind?

154
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:56,373
"In the wind"? Really?

155
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:59,501
The woman isn't
a world-class felon. She'll turn up.

156
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,379
Well, it better be soon,
or the deal's off the table

157
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:03,630
and I'm going after
your clients.

158
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:06,675
That's funny.
I don't think so.

159
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:08,885
The SEC decided
they had no case

160
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:10,345
and their burden
of proof is lower.

161
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:13,598
If you had something on my clients,
you would have charged them already.

162
00:07:13,724 --> 00:07:16,435
Harvey, I went out
on a limb for you.

163
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:20,355
You make me look bad on this, I promise
you, you'll regret it.

164
00:07:24,318 --> 00:07:26,570
Donna,
where the hell is Mike?

165
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:47,591
Hey, anyone know
a guy named Bradley?

166
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:49,634
Yeah. Guy who's about
to miss the jumper.

167
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:52,846
All right. Does he have
a last name?

168
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:54,014
Yeah, Brickstein.

169
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,765
Do I look like
I have time for jokes?

170
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:57,100
Reger.

171
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:04,733
Bradley.

172
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:07,277
Come on, I'm open!

173
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:08,403
Mr. Reger.

174
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:14,451
Bradley Reger!

175
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:18,246
I'm sorry.
Can I help you?

176
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:24,711
I'm sure you've heard about the
investigation regarding Gabby Stone?

177
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:27,672
Are you with the
Department of Justice?

178
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:30,467
I have

179
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:33,803
several questions for you.

180
00:08:34,388 --> 00:08:37,474
Did you help Gabby when she was charged
with insider trading?

181
00:08:39,143 --> 00:08:40,810
Of course I did.
She wasn't just a trader.

182
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:42,562
She was my friend.

183
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:44,105
I recommended a lawyer
and let her borrow some cash

184
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:45,315
after you guys
froze her account.

185
00:08:45,441 --> 00:08:47,859
That was Henderson.
He's a stickler for procedure.

186
00:08:47,985 --> 00:08:49,319
Tell me, when was the last
time you saw her?

187
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:52,280
Bradley. Let me inform you
that withholding knowledge

188
00:08:52,406 --> 00:08:55,367
of the whereabouts of a known fugitive
is a federal offense.

189
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:57,160
Do you understand me?

190
00:08:57,578 --> 00:08:58,870
Gabby came in here
20 minutes ago.

191
00:08:58,996 --> 00:09:00,997
She asked to borrow my keycard
to Morello Assets' offices,

192
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:02,457
and I gave it to her.

193
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:05,293
Well, the Department
appreciates your honesty.

194
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:07,379
Oh, and, uh,
Mr. Reger.

195
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:09,089
Put a little arc
in your jump shot. All right?

196
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:10,257
If poor shooting
were a crime,

197
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:12,759
I'd be forced to arrest you right here.
It's embarrassing.

198
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:15,136
Go get them.

199
00:09:20,184 --> 00:09:22,352
Harvey.
I know where she is.

200
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:28,316
What are you doing here?
I told you I'd get her.

201
00:09:28,442 --> 00:09:29,317
And I would
let you.

202
00:09:29,443 --> 00:09:31,486
I just wanted to make
sure she didn't get away again.

203
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:33,947
The water was right outside
the room, okay?

204
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:35,824
And you said innocent
people don't run.

205
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:38,285
Do guilty people run
back to the scene of the crime?

206
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:39,869
We don't know
what she's doing.

207
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:42,372
She could be planning on taking a
baseball bat to all these computers,

208
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:44,499
for all we know.

209
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:52,132
Gabby,
what are you doing?

210
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:55,468
That stock was
on my tip sheet. It was on mine.

211
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:59,639
If I could find that tip sheet,
I could prove my innocence.

212
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:02,392
Is this what
guilty people do?

213
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:07,314
I know they're your clients,
but can you help me? Please.

214
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,983
I'm sorry. You can
either come with us,

215
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:12,736
or we'll have the
Department of Justice bring you in.

216
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:24,289
So, I meant
to ask you,

217
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:26,249
how did your friend's
interview go yesterday?

218
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:28,752
Teresa? She didn't get
the internship.

219
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:31,296
So how do you
feel about that?

220
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:32,547
To be honest,
I'm relieved.

221
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:35,383
I mean, she would have been a daily
reminder of what I couldn't do.

222
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:38,053
That I'll never score high enough on
the LSAT's or get into law school.

223
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:40,096
You know, that doesn't
have to be true.

224
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:43,016
It is. I need to accept
that I will always be a paralegal

225
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:44,893
because of
this stupid test.

226
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:57,989
I had a hard time sleeping last night.
You want to know why?

227
00:10:58,115 --> 00:11:00,367
- No.
- Because Gabby Stone is innocent.

228
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:02,035
Well, I slept
like a baby.

229
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:03,286
I don't think
you believe that.

230
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:05,830
You think she's innocent, too.
You just don't want to pursue it.

231
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:07,374
She's not our client.

232
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,042
No, Morello
is our client.

233
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:11,211
And if someone else
in that office is responsible

234
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:14,214
and they do it again, then won't that
put our client in jeopardy?

235
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,299
Ooh, yep.

236
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:17,550
I'm right,
and you know it.

237
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:20,887
And now you have
the responsibility to investigate.

238
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:24,224
Did you tell that guy
at the basketball court

239
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,768
that you were an attorney for the
Department of Justice?

240
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:31,731
Not explicitly.

241
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:33,692
I mean, people hear
what they want to hear.

242
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:35,610
I won't impersonate
a federal agent again.

243
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:38,571
Probably a good idea.

244
00:11:39,156 --> 00:11:40,490
Yeah.

245
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:52,460
Oh, hey, Mike.

246
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:55,255
Um, can I give you my roommate's cat
for the weekend?

247
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,382
Let's get it over with.
I have some actual work to do.

248
00:11:57,508 --> 00:11:58,466
No, no, no.
It's not what you think.

249
00:11:58,592 --> 00:12:01,428
It's just very annoying, and I figured
if you were looking after it,

250
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:02,971
the cat is as good
as gone. Right?

251
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:06,558
Gentlemen.
What's going on?

252
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:08,560
Some sort of
shenanigans?

253
00:12:09,186 --> 00:12:12,522
Uh, no. It's nothing. It's just stuff
between the associates.

254
00:12:12,648 --> 00:12:14,190
I said,
what's going on?

255
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:16,568
It's... Seth's just
giving me a hard time

256
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:18,403
for losing Gabby Stone
yesterday.

257
00:12:20,614 --> 00:12:22,031
Although, we know, at this firm,
that we don't dwell

258
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:24,993
on our colleagues'
mistakes. Right?

259
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:27,912
I mean, just because one of your fellow
associates is incompetent

260
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:29,831
doesn't mean you have to constantly
remind this moron

261
00:12:29,957 --> 00:12:31,416
what a careless idiot
he really is. Right?

262
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,086
You.

263
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:41,009
Harold, I called you
two nights ago

264
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:42,218
and you didn't
answer your phone.

265
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:45,221
Which is really funny, because you're
a first-year associate

266
00:12:45,347 --> 00:12:47,807
who's lucky enough to be working here
at Pearson Hardman.

267
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:49,768
So when I need to
get a hold of you,

268
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:52,103
you will be reachable
at all times.

269
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:53,229
I don't care if
you're in a coma,

270
00:12:53,355 --> 00:12:54,731
a hospital that's
burning down,

271
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:56,274
your mother's about to jump off
the Brooklyn Bridge.

272
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,484
You will pick up
your phone.

273
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:58,610
Absolutely.

274
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:00,153
- Got it?
- Yes.

275
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:05,074
Okay, thanks. Can you get out
of my office, please?

276
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:14,209
Harvey, once this whole
Morello thing gets fixed,

277
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:15,877
remind me to be
irritated with you

278
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:18,213
for not billing more
on the Swindon merger.

279
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:21,508
The fact is, mergers are boring,
okay? Plus, I'm busy.

280
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:24,052
Also, mergers? Boring.

281
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:25,553
How did you get these?

282
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:28,056
You mean tickets to the
Royal Shakespeare Company's

283
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:29,265
production of King Lear?

284
00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:31,559
This show was sold out
the minute these tickets went on sale.

285
00:13:31,685 --> 00:13:33,353
I live for King Lear.
How did you know that?

286
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:35,396
It's my job
to know that.

287
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:36,898
But why?

288
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:39,567
Louis, your billables
are outstanding.

289
00:13:39,693 --> 00:13:42,403
You've landed three high-profile
clients in a month,

290
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:44,405
and I want to show
you my appreciation.

291
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:47,325
And I'm very happy
that you're excited.

292
00:13:47,451 --> 00:13:49,494
So should we get dinner before
or after the play?

293
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:53,164
Uh, I don't know.

294
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:55,625
Jessica, do you remember
when we went to that Yankee game

295
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:58,127
and you caught that foul ball
and you ate all my nachos?

296
00:13:58,254 --> 00:14:02,298
Did we go to the steak house that night?
Oh, that was a good meal.

297
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:06,845
Have a good time.

298
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:10,139
You know what, Louis?
Dinner after.

299
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:11,266
I'll have Norma
make a reservation.

300
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:12,392
Fantastic.

301
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:26,322
Dean, Gabby Stone is still making noises
about these tip sheets.

302
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:29,242
She insists that she
had a different sheet

303
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:30,285
on the day she
bought Lunardi.

304
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:31,494
She's lying.

305
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:35,248
I understand. But after she broke
into your offices last night,

306
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:38,585
the DOJ might be inclined to start
rattling cages again.

307
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:41,087
So, for the record,

308
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,923
you're telling me
the truth, right?

309
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:46,384
Harvey. You work
for me, remember?

310
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:47,552
Well, as your lawyer,

311
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:50,054
I need to be able to tell the DOJ
that we're all above board.

312
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,139
Of course.

313
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:52,807
So you won't mind
if I look around for myself?

314
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:55,393
We've had a clean
record for 50 years.

315
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:57,770
Please, Harvey,
look around.

316
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:03,943
Why is that on my desk?

317
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:05,945
Because the LSAT's are
a week from Saturday.

318
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:07,238
Great. Go away.
I'm busy.

319
00:15:07,364 --> 00:15:09,657
There are only four tests a year.
Which means if you miss this one,

320
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:11,117
you're going to have to wait
another three months.

321
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:13,745
I can do math, too,
Good Will Hunting.

322
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:16,748
When did I say I was ready
to re-take the LSAT's?

323
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:17,874
I thought that after
our talk, you...

324
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,335
Nothing about our talk said I'm
interested in bombing the test again.

325
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:22,128
- You're not going to bomb it again.
- How do you know?

326
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:23,296
Because the first
time you took it,

327
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:26,049
you were missing one
essential ingredient.

328
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:28,176
- Me.
- Not interested.

329
00:15:32,556 --> 00:15:35,141
If I let you help me,
will you leave me alone?

330
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:36,267
Mmm-hmm.

331
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:37,894
Okay.

332
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:40,188
I'll see you later.
Get excited.

333
00:15:41,565 --> 00:15:42,857
Woo-hoo.

334
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:48,613
Hey, I forget. Why are we looking
into Gabby Stone again?

335
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:50,823
Oh, right. Because I said
she's innocent,

336
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:51,991
and now you agree with me.

337
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:54,285
No, I don't agree with
you that she's innocent.

338
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:58,331
But if there's even the slightest chance
that someone else is involved,

339
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:01,209
they're putting the whole company at
risk. And I can't have that.

340
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:04,379
Okay, so you disagree with
what we agree about?

341
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,381
I'll agree with that.

342
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:11,844
I don't feel sorry
for Gabby Stone at all.

343
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,054
Because?

344
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:15,598
I found her.
I was her immediate supervisor.

345
00:16:15,724 --> 00:16:17,058
I nurtured her.

346
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:19,227
And then she tries
to cheat and give us a bad name.

347
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:21,020
How commonplace would you say
cheating is here?

348
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:23,314
It's not. That's not
the kind of shop we run.

349
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,066
So when Ms. Stone
made the trade

350
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:27,402
and the investment tripled in value,
you weren't suspicious?

351
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:29,487
My job's not to worry about the traders
that are making money.

352
00:16:29,613 --> 00:16:32,490
My job is to worry
about the traders who aren't.

353
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:04,856
So how exactly does
the tip sheet system work?

354
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:07,608
Our technical analysts
predict stocks that are likely to have

355
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:09,402
larger than expected
volatility.

356
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:12,155
These predictions are handed out to our
traders on a daily basis

357
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:14,157
in the form
of a tip sheet.

358
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:15,825
All these traders get
the same tip sheet?

359
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:18,286
Exactly. They're printed
on red paper so they can't be copied.

360
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:20,538
Every trader is responsible
for returning their sheet

361
00:17:20,664 --> 00:17:22,248
at the end of the day
so they can be shredded.

362
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:23,791
So no records exist.

363
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:25,209
We keep
electronic copies.

364
00:17:25,335 --> 00:17:27,128
I'll need to see those copies
for the last year.

365
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:29,297
I thought you might.
I'm assuming you own a computer?

366
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:32,175
One more thing. I'll need to see
a list of all the trades

367
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:34,302
Morello Assets made
in the last year.

368
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:36,596
Well,
I can't give you that.

369
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:37,805
Why not?

370
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:39,682
The tip sheets
have expired,

371
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:41,267
but our current positions,

372
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:43,394
that's proprietary
information.

373
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,271
I can't release that
on just your say-so.

374
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:47,690
That's not a request.
We need to protect the company.

375
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:49,442
And we're covered
under attorney-client privilege.

376
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:51,194
And I'm telling you
I'm not giving you shit.

377
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:54,655
You think I don't know
what attorney-client privilege is?

378
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:56,866
You know, you corporate
lawyers look down your noses at us

379
00:17:56,992 --> 00:17:58,910
because we didn't go
to Ivy League schools.

380
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:00,912
Just because I don't
have a fancy degree

381
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:03,372
doesn't mean you get to come into
my house and order me around.

382
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:04,749
And you go whine
to Morello,

383
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:07,418
and I'll knock you
on your ass like the puss you are.

384
00:18:09,671 --> 00:18:11,714
Well, Sam, I'm sorry
that you feel that way.

385
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,384
But I've been working for your boss,
Dean Morello, for a very long time.

386
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:17,303
And let me tell
you something.

387
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:18,596
If you try to
stonewall me,

388
00:18:18,722 --> 00:18:20,932
you'll be out on the street
in less than a week.

389
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:24,644
As for the other stuff, do I think that
I'm smarter than you?

390
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,104
You're damn right I do.

391
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,065
But if you think that means that I
can't kick your ass

392
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:32,693
up and down this floor,
take a swing and see what happens.

393
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:37,615
I didn't think so.

394
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:43,579
- Here you go.
- That was amazing.

395
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:46,207
It was like he was Mr. T
and you were Rocky.

396
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:47,667
But, like, not Rocky
at the beginning,

397
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:49,127
when he's all
scared of Mr. T.

398
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:50,628
But at the end,
when he was all, like,

399
00:18:50,754 --> 00:18:53,297
"Uh, give it
your best shot." You know?

400
00:18:53,423 --> 00:18:56,092
Adrian! Yes!

401
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:58,261
That's funny. But you might want to wipe
that grin off your face.

402
00:18:58,387 --> 00:18:59,387
What? Why?

403
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:01,222
Because without those trades,
we don't have shit.

404
00:19:01,348 --> 00:19:03,099
And your little girlfriend
is going to rot in jail.

405
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:05,101
And by the way, you've got to work
on your Stallone.

406
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:07,228
- You need a lower register.
- Uh!

407
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:09,188
That was an incredible
Stallone.

408
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:11,065
I've been doing that since I was a kid.
You can't touch it.

409
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:12,024
Uh!

410
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:14,277
- Not with food in your mouth.
- No, I swallowed it.

411
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:16,070
- Uh!
- There's food in your mouth.

412
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:18,281
- Adrian!
- That's disgusting.

413
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:22,326
Come on.
You got this one.

414
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:24,245
It's "A."

415
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,706
You know what?
It's "C."

416
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:28,541
Actually, it's "D."
It's definitely "D."

417
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:30,209
Final answer?

418
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:31,711
Yes. "D."

419
00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:34,046
It's "A."

420
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:36,716
Rachel, you've
got to remember.

421
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:38,759
They're asking why the argument
is most vulnerable.

422
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:41,137
I could make the case that they're all
vulnerable arguments.

423
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:42,889
You could. But your first
instinct was "A."

424
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:43,848
You've got to
go with your gut.

425
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:46,434
Right. So what if my gut can find the
exception where "A" is wrong?

426
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,435
What am I supposed
to do then?

427
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:48,394
You ignore it.

428
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,729
I can't. That's easier
said than done.

429
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:51,189
Look, the test isn't trying
to trick you, Rachel.

430
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:52,899
But sometimes,
it is, Mike.

431
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:53,983
Well, you've got
to let that go.

432
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:55,359
- I can't.
- Why not?

433
00:19:55,485 --> 00:19:57,028
Because I don't want
to get any questions wrong.

434
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:01,449
Okay. I think we
found your problem.

435
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:03,910
You're so afraid of getting fooled
by a few trick questions

436
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:05,661
that you're letting it mess you up with
all the other ones.

437
00:20:05,787 --> 00:20:09,040
Look, Rachel, you want
to get into Harvard, you need a 170.

438
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:12,293
Okay? If you let a few of these
trick questions go,

439
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:13,836
you're going
to be fine.

440
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:15,546
But if you keep trying
to be perfect,

441
00:20:15,672 --> 00:20:17,048
you're going to over-think
this whole thing

442
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:19,884
and you're going
to end up with a 130.

443
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:20,968
Rachel.

444
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:23,137
Nobody gets all
the trick questions.

445
00:20:23,847 --> 00:20:25,014
What about you?

446
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:28,935
First grade, they gave
me an achievement test.

447
00:20:29,853 --> 00:20:31,479
I scored in the
99th percentile.

448
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:33,481
So, they kept giving me
achievement tests

449
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:36,400
all the way up to the
eighth grade level.

450
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:39,862
And I kept getting in the 99th
percentile on every one of them.

451
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:42,865
What, you couldn't
get the 100th?

452
00:20:43,283 --> 00:20:45,076
There is no 100th.

453
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:50,081
Next question.
Come on.

454
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:52,959
King Lear.

455
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:54,543
I happen to like
King Lear.

456
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:56,170
And unlike some
people I know,

457
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:59,090
Louis' references don't
begin and end with Top Gun.

458
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:01,092
Hey, I love Louis.
And I don't care what you say,

459
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:02,677
I am not leaving
my wingman.

460
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:07,181
You see, that's funny,
because that's from Top Gun.

461
00:21:07,307 --> 00:21:09,100
"He's a wildcard,
flies by the seat of his pants."

462
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:13,312
You think I can't quote
Top Gun? Get the hell out of here.

463
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:14,272
Oh, that was good.

464
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:16,315
Hey, Mike.

465
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:18,818
Bert Kimble's coming to see me.
I need you in the meeting.

466
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:20,820
Whoa. The number
two at Morello?

467
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:23,990
I bet he's coming to yell at you after
your big showdown there yesterday.

468
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:25,658
If you need me,
I've got your back.

469
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:28,327
You thinking about
finally going to law school?

470
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,663
Oh. No, I'm helping
Rachel study.

471
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:32,164
The pretty paralegal.
Got it.

472
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,833
Okay.
It's not like that.

473
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:35,293
It's exactly like that.

474
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:37,044
Oh, that reminds me.

475
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:39,505
How did you manage
to take the LSAT's for a woman?

476
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:41,382
What do you mean?
We took the test the same day.

477
00:21:41,508 --> 00:21:43,509
She signed my name on hers, and I
signed hers on mine.

478
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:45,553
Why? What's so funny?

479
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:47,722
I just pictured
you in drag.

480
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:51,434
I could pull that off.
I've got soft features.

481
00:21:53,186 --> 00:21:55,479
I want to apologize
for Samuel's behavior.

482
00:21:55,605 --> 00:21:57,106
He's had a chip
on his shoulder

483
00:21:57,232 --> 00:22:00,735
ever since the Department of Justice
investigated Ms. Stone's malfeasance.

484
00:22:01,236 --> 00:22:03,487
He's very protective
of the firm.

485
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:05,531
He's a good man to
have in your corner.

486
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:08,868
Well, so are you.
In these folders,

487
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:11,996
you will find every trade
made by Morello Assets in the last year.

488
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:14,248
Personally delivered
by Bert Kimble? I'm flattered.

489
00:22:14,374 --> 00:22:17,501
Well, we just want to make sure you've
got everything you need, Harvey.

490
00:22:17,627 --> 00:22:19,670
We really appreciate
your diligence.

491
00:22:19,796 --> 00:22:21,505
Now, I better get
back to the office.

492
00:22:21,631 --> 00:22:24,717
The Australian markets
are just opening up. Good to see you.

493
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:26,761
Always a pleasure, Bert.

494
00:22:29,639 --> 00:22:31,265
Harvey, this is great.

495
00:22:31,391 --> 00:22:33,642
We can take these
tip sheets and put the...

496
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:35,061
What are you doing?

497
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:36,979
This guy's not that friendly
to his own mother.

498
00:22:37,105 --> 00:22:39,440
He's hiding something,
and I'm pissed.

499
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:41,150
What are you
talking about?

500
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:43,277
Those aren't
the real trades.

501
00:22:43,403 --> 00:22:45,446
Okay. So how do
we get them?

502
00:22:46,823 --> 00:22:48,824
Right.
How do I get them?

503
00:22:51,578 --> 00:22:52,661
Hmm.

504
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:02,671
Hello?

505
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:04,882
You figure out how to get the
most profitable trades yet, Mike?

506
00:23:05,008 --> 00:23:07,009
The Morello brokers hang out at
a bar called the Closing Bell.

507
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:07,968
I'm on my way now.

508
00:23:08,095 --> 00:23:10,554
Just remember, you're working.
I'll talk to you later.

509
00:23:31,952 --> 00:23:33,494
Can I get a beer?

510
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:36,163
Thank you.

511
00:24:08,071 --> 00:24:10,406
Hey, hey, hey!
What's up, toolbox?

512
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:12,700
Oh, man. If you drink that
beer any slower,

513
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:14,493
I'm going to have
to get you a nipple.

514
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:16,162
Do I know you, or...

515
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:18,497
Vince Landis.
Morello Assets.

516
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,124
- Yeah. That's me.
- Yeah.

517
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:25,004
Russell Ginther. The "Gin."
The "Ginthesizer."

518
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:25,963
- What are you talking about?
- Come on.

519
00:24:26,089 --> 00:24:29,091
Gervich Investments, man. We got
shit-housed here a couple of weeks ago.

520
00:24:29,217 --> 00:24:30,050
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

521
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:33,179
You, me, Pepiol,
Causwell, Williamson.

522
00:24:33,513 --> 00:24:35,931
That guy, Dick. You still owe
me 20 bucks!

523
00:24:36,057 --> 00:24:37,850
Yeah, right. Russell.

524
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:38,934
Right. Right.

525
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,978
You still begging for
scraps over there at Gervich, or what?

526
00:24:41,104 --> 00:24:42,897
You wish.

527
00:24:43,023 --> 00:24:45,191
Hey, I need a shot.
What is this?

528
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:46,609
Oh, drink mine.
Please.

529
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:47,735
Mmm.

530
00:24:48,111 --> 00:24:49,195
- Baker?
- Uh-huh.

531
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:50,446
You're better
than that, man.

532
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:56,952
Money!

533
00:25:01,374 --> 00:25:03,125
God, you guys are
a bunch of pussies.

534
00:25:03,251 --> 00:25:05,336
I guarantee you
my biggest trades

535
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:07,213
kick the ass out of
your biggest trades.

536
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:08,380
I don't think so,
brother.

537
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:12,927
Last month, I made $2 million
on Cahill Metals in one hour!

538
00:25:13,053 --> 00:25:14,720
Two million?

539
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:17,473
I made four million
off of Montroluxx back in February.

540
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:19,767
That stock tripled
overnight. What's up?

541
00:25:19,893 --> 00:25:21,977
Four million?
Oh, that's adorable.

542
00:25:22,103 --> 00:25:25,356
How about the six million
I just cleared on Rypien Micro Devices?

543
00:25:25,482 --> 00:25:28,484
Oh, yeah? What do you think my boy here
made on Piper Web Systems?

544
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:29,985
- What, this guy?
- Uh-huh.

545
00:25:30,111 --> 00:25:33,489
Uh, I don't know. A pack of chewing gum
and your sister's panties?

546
00:25:38,161 --> 00:25:39,245
Oh, it's on.

547
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:40,454
Oh!

548
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:42,581
Vince Landis!

549
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:44,750
Seven million off
of Drogin Limited.

550
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:47,211
Eight million
off of Epling RTX.

551
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:50,756
$9 million off of RMA
Integrated Products.

552
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:54,385
Well, gentlemen,
greed is good.

553
00:25:54,511 --> 00:25:56,845
So's his sister, right?

554
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:59,473
Come on, man. That's his sister.
That's not cool.

555
00:26:00,141 --> 00:26:02,184
Dude, you just made,
like, the same joke.

556
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:04,144
Ah!

557
00:26:06,481 --> 00:26:09,066
Hey,
Bradley's finally here.

558
00:26:10,485 --> 00:26:14,321
Uh, all right, ladies. Listen, I've got
to split. It's been real.

559
00:26:14,447 --> 00:26:16,323
- I'll get drinks next time, all right?
- Right.

560
00:26:16,449 --> 00:26:18,284
Make money, money,
make money!

561
00:26:30,463 --> 00:26:31,589
Whoo!

562
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:36,760
Ah.

563
00:26:39,306 --> 00:26:41,890
Harvey.
I got the trades.

564
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:43,392
Good. We'll talk tomorrow.

565
00:26:43,518 --> 00:26:44,893
What? No.
I'm coming over now.

566
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:46,103
You're drunk.
Do not come over.

567
00:26:46,229 --> 00:26:49,064
All right, cool.
I'll see you in a minute.

568
00:26:51,985 --> 00:26:54,111
Hey! Harvey, come on!

569
00:26:54,237 --> 00:26:56,947
We've got to save Gabby!
"Gabbolini."

570
00:26:58,033 --> 00:27:01,118
Oh. Oh, you've got
a sweet place, dude.

571
00:27:01,244 --> 00:27:02,328
Don't ever call me "dude."

572
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:04,747
You think that maybe
I could take it off your hands?

573
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:06,749
Like, when you're
going out of town?

574
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:09,209
Like a...
Like a house-sitting type situation?

575
00:27:09,336 --> 00:27:11,420
Remind me to have
Donna get you a spare key.

576
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:12,921
You have the trades?

577
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:14,340
Ta-da!

578
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:16,550
- Good.
- Hey, when can we, uh...

579
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:18,886
I'm still upset
that I didn't get the internship.

580
00:27:19,012 --> 00:27:20,387
It would have been so much fun to work
together, don't you think?

581
00:27:20,513 --> 00:27:22,598
Mmm, absolutely.

582
00:27:23,558 --> 00:27:25,309
Let me ask
you something.

583
00:27:25,435 --> 00:27:28,187
How did you turn it around
with the LSAT's?

584
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:30,022
What do you mean?

585
00:27:31,107 --> 00:27:33,233
Come on. You took them,
didn't do so well.

586
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,777
And now,
you're at Harvard Law?

587
00:27:34,903 --> 00:27:38,072
That's exactly what
I want to be doing. You can tell me.

588
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:39,782
What did you do, sleep with the grader?

589
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:43,494
What?

590
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:50,292
I paid someone to
take them for me.

591
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:54,922
- What?
- Uh...

592
00:27:55,757 --> 00:27:57,383
There was this guy.

593
00:27:57,509 --> 00:28:00,344
I heard about him from
a friend of a friend.

594
00:28:01,137 --> 00:28:04,515
I paid him a 1,000 bucks
and he took the LSAT's for me.

595
00:28:05,141 --> 00:28:06,266
He got me a 172.

596
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:08,602
You cheated on the LSAT's?

597
00:28:08,728 --> 00:28:11,897
When we were paralegals, we were smarter
than half the associates.

598
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:13,607
Why... Why should I
be denied my chance

599
00:28:13,733 --> 00:28:15,818
because I can't pass
some stupid test?

600
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:17,861
I'm living my dream,
Rach.

601
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,572
I'm not going to
apologize for it to anyone.

602
00:28:24,994 --> 00:28:27,788
Come on. Come on.
Come on.

603
00:28:32,502 --> 00:28:33,544
Hello?

604
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:35,421
Mikey. Yo, it's Scott.

605
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:37,131
Scott.
How are you, man?

606
00:28:37,257 --> 00:28:39,341
I haven't talked
to you in forever.

607
00:28:39,467 --> 00:28:43,595
You still taking LSAT's for other
people? I have a customer for you.

608
00:28:44,514 --> 00:28:48,016
No, man. I'm... I'm not in that business
anymore. I'm sorry.

609
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:52,688
Trust me. You want to take this meeting,
dude. This chick is smoking hot.

610
00:28:54,023 --> 00:28:55,524
What's her name?

611
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:56,817
Rachel Zane.

612
00:28:58,361 --> 00:28:59,778
You didn't give her
my name, did you?

613
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:01,488
No. Of course not.

614
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:04,074
I'm not taking
that meeting, man.

615
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:36,315
What do you want me
to sign now?

616
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:37,858
A confession that
I killed Kennedy?

617
00:29:37,984 --> 00:29:39,860
I'm not going to pretend
to be your best friend, Ms. Stone.

618
00:29:39,986 --> 00:29:41,820
But my interests happen to be aligned
with yours right now.

619
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:42,946
So, please, sit down.

620
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:50,245
Your colleagues'
most profitable trades.

621
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:52,414
Why are you showing
them to me?

622
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:54,416
Every single one of them
comes from stocks

623
00:29:54,542 --> 00:29:56,668
that Morello Assets
didn't officially recommend.

624
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:58,879
This is either a hell
of a coincidence,

625
00:29:59,005 --> 00:30:01,465
or these traders were
all given different tip sheets.

626
00:30:01,591 --> 00:30:02,716
So you believe me.

627
00:30:02,842 --> 00:30:05,344
When I said my tip sheet had Lunardi
Pharmaceuticals on it.

628
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:08,639
Well, I'm getting there.
But you got flagged by the DOJ,

629
00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:11,642
and no one else at Morello did.
So I want to know why.

630
00:30:11,893 --> 00:30:13,227
What's different here?

631
00:30:13,353 --> 00:30:14,520
Uh...

632
00:30:15,104 --> 00:30:16,563
None of these trades
are for more than nine million.

633
00:30:16,689 --> 00:30:18,857
That's Morello's
recommended amount.

634
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:21,693
And your Lunardi purchase
was for $10 million.

635
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:24,738
Maybe someone figured out that any
trade under $10 million

636
00:30:24,864 --> 00:30:26,365
wouldn't draw
DOJ attention.

637
00:30:26,741 --> 00:30:29,785
Why did you make a trade for $1 million
more than the recommended amount?

638
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:32,120
Look at me.

639
00:30:32,372 --> 00:30:34,748
I'm not exactly
fraternity material.

640
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:39,336
It's a cutthroat world
and I wasn't performing well.

641
00:30:39,587 --> 00:30:42,130
So I took a chance and
I tried to hit it big.

642
00:30:43,883 --> 00:30:45,676
I picked the wrong trade.

643
00:30:46,886 --> 00:30:48,971
Gabby, if you knew
you were innocent,

644
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:50,639
then why didn't you
fight this harder?

645
00:30:53,601 --> 00:30:57,521
After I saw how much money the trade
made, I suspected something.

646
00:30:58,273 --> 00:30:59,439
I went to Bert Kimble.

647
00:30:59,899 --> 00:31:03,861
He reassured me that I made a profitable
trade and did nothing wrong.

648
00:31:03,987 --> 00:31:05,362
He even told me I...

649
00:31:05,488 --> 00:31:08,782
I had a $300,000 bonus coming at the end
of the quarter.

650
00:31:10,493 --> 00:31:11,994
I should have
gone to someone.

651
00:31:12,787 --> 00:31:14,454
Said something.

652
00:31:16,791 --> 00:31:21,128
I made one mistake, and I'm going to
regret it for the rest of my life.

653
00:31:24,591 --> 00:31:27,384
Scott. Yeah,
it's Mike Ross.

654
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:32,222
This Rachel Zane. Tell her
I'll take the meeting.

655
00:31:32,932 --> 00:31:34,600
Just don't tell
her my name.

656
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:36,643
Who was that
on the phone?

657
00:31:36,769 --> 00:31:38,103
It was nothing.

658
00:31:50,825 --> 00:31:52,159
Are you thinking
about Gabby?

659
00:31:52,285 --> 00:31:53,535
I'm thinking
about her lawyer.

660
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:55,495
What?

661
00:31:55,622 --> 00:31:58,290
Knowing what she said, why would that
Zegan guy agree to a deal

662
00:31:58,416 --> 00:32:00,375
that puts his client behind bars
without even putting up a fight?

663
00:32:00,501 --> 00:32:02,210
I can't stand that
kind of shoddy work.

664
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:03,837
He's like the bad
version of both of us.

665
00:32:03,963 --> 00:32:05,923
He doesn't care about his client
and he's not about winning.

666
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:07,966
He's got even less
style than you.

667
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:09,885
I don't really see
how that's relevant. At all.

668
00:32:10,011 --> 00:32:11,762
Hold on. How did she
get this lawyer?

669
00:32:11,888 --> 00:32:12,721
Her friend, Bradley.

670
00:32:12,847 --> 00:32:14,306
The one who also
works at Morello.

671
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:15,557
Yeah.

672
00:32:16,643 --> 00:32:18,936
I don't think Bradley's
as good a friend as she thinks he is.

673
00:32:19,062 --> 00:32:20,395
Here's what
you're going to do.

674
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:26,151
I looked into it.
You were right.

675
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:28,070
You put this
together fast.

676
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:30,197
I care about Gabby.

677
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:33,158
You were right, too.

678
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:36,203
You want me
to go with you?

679
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:40,791
I'm sorry, but I've got to take
care of this one myself.

680
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:53,095
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

681
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:54,429
Rachel?

682
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:57,683
What are you doing
all the way over here?

683
00:32:57,809 --> 00:33:00,811
Uh, this guy has
the best soft pretzels in town.

684
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:02,771
- Do you want to try it?
- No, I'm good.

685
00:33:02,897 --> 00:33:04,731
Hey, how are you
feeling about the LSAT's?

686
00:33:04,857 --> 00:33:06,650
I was really happy with
all the prep we did yesterday.

687
00:33:06,776 --> 00:33:07,693
I'm really excited
for you.

688
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:10,362
You're excited for me?
Why do you even care?

689
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:11,571
I was just asking.

690
00:33:11,698 --> 00:33:13,407
Well, just stop
asking. Look...

691
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:16,535
I came down here because I just wanted
to be by myself, and I bump into you.

692
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:18,745
And the first thing
you want to talk about is the LSAT's?

693
00:33:18,871 --> 00:33:20,580
Okay. I'm sorry. I...

694
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:24,584
The truth is, I came down here
to clear my head, too.

695
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:25,877
About what?

696
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:27,004
It's Gabby Stone.

697
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:28,714
The girl who did
the insider trading?

698
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:31,591
She actually suspected that something
was wrong after the trade,

699
00:33:31,718 --> 00:33:32,718
but she didn't do
anything about it.

700
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:34,886
She didn't want to
jeopardize her career.

701
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:39,141
Now she's going to be paying for that
mistake the rest of her life.

702
00:33:40,226 --> 00:33:42,060
Anyway, I'm sorry
I ruined your alone time.

703
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:43,645
I'll see you
back at the office.

704
00:33:49,819 --> 00:33:51,778
Let me ask you
something, Nick.

705
00:33:51,904 --> 00:33:54,156
Does Bert Kimble
drag his feet paying you, too?

706
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:55,115
Excuse me?

707
00:33:55,241 --> 00:33:57,492
Because in my experience,
getting money from that asshole

708
00:33:57,618 --> 00:33:59,119
is like getting blood
from a stone.

709
00:33:59,245 --> 00:34:00,328
I don't know what
you're talking about.

710
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:01,580
Yes, you do.

711
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:05,876
You see, after I saw your client sitting
in jail, I got to wondering.

712
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:07,461
How did she find you?

713
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:08,670
I'm going to
call security.

714
00:34:08,796 --> 00:34:09,796
Absolutely.

715
00:34:09,922 --> 00:34:12,716
See, it turns out that
her friend, Bradley, recommended you.

716
00:34:12,842 --> 00:34:16,094
Bradley, who's been at Morello Assets
for the past seven years.

717
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:18,805
So, I checked.
You know what I found?

718
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:23,769
You represented Bert Kimble
in a civil suit 12 years ago.

719
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:25,812
It just so happens
that you also represented

720
00:34:25,938 --> 00:34:28,648
Lunardi Pharmaceuticals
in their FDA approval proceedings.

721
00:34:31,152 --> 00:34:32,277
That doesn't
mean anything.

722
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:34,029
You've seen my
relationship with the DOJ.

723
00:34:34,155 --> 00:34:35,864
Do you want me to
point them in your direction?

724
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:39,201
Or do you want to admit to me that Bert
Kimble is paying you off?

725
00:34:57,553 --> 00:35:00,305
Harvey.
I don't understand.

726
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,933
I thought all this business
was done with.

727
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:04,601
It's almost
sorted out, Dean.

728
00:35:04,727 --> 00:35:06,686
I'm just here to let you know
that Bert's a crook.

729
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:09,272
- What did you say?
- Harvey...

730
00:35:09,398 --> 00:35:10,482
He used a lawyer

731
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:13,110
to periodically
provide him with inside information.

732
00:35:13,486 --> 00:35:15,362
Once he got
this information,

733
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:18,281
he handed out one tip sheet different
from all the others.

734
00:35:18,407 --> 00:35:20,867
So, the trader, in this instance,
Gabriele Stone,

735
00:35:20,993 --> 00:35:24,371
would make a trade not knowing that she
was acting on an illegal tip.

736
00:35:24,497 --> 00:35:26,331
It was actually
ingenious.

737
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:28,542
If the trade was
ever under suspicion,

738
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:30,210
even the trader
couldn't point to Bert.

739
00:35:30,336 --> 00:35:31,920
Okay. We've heard
more than enough. Thank you.

740
00:35:32,046 --> 00:35:34,714
I don't think so.
Ms. Stone made two mistakes.

741
00:35:34,841 --> 00:35:37,717
One, she made a trade for more
than $9 million.

742
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:39,761
The other was not
going to the DOJ

743
00:35:39,887 --> 00:35:41,721
the second the stock
shot up through the roof.

744
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:43,598
You son of a bitch.
I...

745
00:35:43,724 --> 00:35:45,684
Harvey, this is
a lot to digest.

746
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:48,895
Well, I'll make it
easy for you, Dean. He's a cancer.

747
00:35:49,188 --> 00:35:51,148
You don't cut him loose,
he's going to kill your whole company.

748
00:35:51,274 --> 00:35:54,943
How dare you walk in here and accuse
me with these things?

749
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:56,862
I mean,
you are my lawyer!

750
00:35:56,988 --> 00:36:00,532
No, Bert. I'm the lawyer
for Morello Asset Management.

751
00:36:00,783 --> 00:36:03,577
As far as the law is concerned, Dean
Morello is my client, not you.

752
00:36:03,703 --> 00:36:04,578
Dumb son of a bitch.

753
00:36:04,704 --> 00:36:05,579
Bert...

754
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:07,706
- You're fired.
- What?

755
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:09,040
Effective immediately.

756
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:11,459
You're going to fire me?
Because of this?

757
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:14,546
I hope you're happy.

758
00:36:14,672 --> 00:36:16,923
Because without me,
this hedge fund is nothing.

759
00:36:17,049 --> 00:36:20,427
I'll be happy when the Department of
Justice puts your ass in handcuffs.

760
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:22,721
Enjoy your freedom, Bert,
because they're coming for you.

761
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:25,932
And since you're a bigger trophy
than Gabriele Stone,

762
00:36:26,058 --> 00:36:28,935
you're going to get
a whole lot more than 11 months.

763
00:36:31,397 --> 00:36:33,732
Harvey,
I want you to know

764
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:36,776
that I knew nothing
about any of this.

765
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:39,696
Dean, when I was
13 years old,

766
00:36:39,822 --> 00:36:42,532
my little brother was getting bullied
by a kid in the neighborhood.

767
00:36:42,658 --> 00:36:45,285
One day, I confronted
the kid's father.

768
00:36:45,411 --> 00:36:47,329
He told me he didn't
know anything about it.

769
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:49,706
You know what his
problem was?

770
00:36:50,499 --> 00:36:52,751
It was his goddamn
job to know.

771
00:37:04,597 --> 00:37:06,223
Thanks for
getting me out.

772
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:08,475
I'm just sorry we couldn't get
you your bonus.

773
00:37:08,601 --> 00:37:10,477
It wasn't mine
to begin with.

774
00:37:10,603 --> 00:37:12,646
But without it, I don't know how
I'm going to pay you.

775
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:15,607
Don't worry about it.
Dean Morello is footing this bill.

776
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:18,693
You believed in me.

777
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:23,323
I can't tell you how grateful I am
to both of you.

778
00:37:23,449 --> 00:37:24,449
Never doubted you
for a second.

779
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:30,247
Oh, Gabby. I, uh, wanted
to give you something.

780
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:33,750
You left it
on your desk.

781
00:37:36,462 --> 00:37:37,295
Thank you.

782
00:37:39,131 --> 00:37:40,715
All right, well,
I'm going to find some water.

783
00:37:42,843 --> 00:37:46,638
You don't come back soon,
we're sending out a search party.

784
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:49,849
You never doubted
her for a second?

785
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:52,102
I didn't doubt her for a second.
I doubted her for days.

786
00:37:52,228 --> 00:37:53,812
Yeah, that's not what just you led
her to believe.

787
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:55,855
People hear what
they want to hear.

788
00:37:55,982 --> 00:37:57,190
Oh, I meant to ask you.

789
00:37:57,316 --> 00:37:59,234
That big guy that
you got in a fight with, Mr. T,

790
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,111
was he in on
this whole thing?

791
00:38:01,237 --> 00:38:03,571
No. He was
just a dick.

792
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:11,121
I mean,
that was the most

793
00:38:11,247 --> 00:38:14,416
brilliant portrayal
of King Lear I have ever seen.

794
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:16,251
"Come not between
the dragon and his wrath."

795
00:38:17,336 --> 00:38:20,672
It was...
Thank you for tonight, Jessica. Really.

796
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:23,967
This was nice.
This was really, really nice.

797
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:27,554
You're welcome, Louis.
And yes, this was really nice.

798
00:38:28,431 --> 00:38:30,515
Listen, I...
I just want you to know

799
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:33,560
how much I appreciate
everything that you do for this firm.

800
00:38:33,936 --> 00:38:35,270
I take a lot of
pride in my work.

801
00:38:35,396 --> 00:38:37,731
I know. And you're very
good at what you do.

802
00:38:37,857 --> 00:38:41,568
Okay. Can you just please say that once
in front of Harvey?

803
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:45,822
Louis, I know you and Harvey
have a rivalry.

804
00:38:48,951 --> 00:38:52,620
And the truth is that, right now, Harvey
is more valuable to the firm.

805
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:59,461
But that doesn't always
mean that he's going to be on top.

806
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:01,921
Because
another truth is,

807
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:05,550
is that I can't always
count on Harvey to listen to me.

808
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:06,760
But I can count on you.

809
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:09,179
Yeah. Yes, you can.

810
00:39:09,555 --> 00:39:11,431
So you keep doing
what you're doing, Louis,

811
00:39:11,557 --> 00:39:13,475
and you're going
to be just fine.

812
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:16,019
And if he doesn't
know it already, I promise,

813
00:39:16,145 --> 00:39:19,856
Harvey is going to understand just how
valuable you are to me.

814
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:24,861
You know, next week,
there's a revival of Cats.

815
00:39:24,987 --> 00:39:25,987
No.

816
00:39:33,579 --> 00:39:35,538
Nice touch. Tickets
to the Yankee game.

817
00:39:35,664 --> 00:39:36,998
Found them on my desk.
Can't wait.

818
00:39:37,124 --> 00:39:38,166
You're welcome.

819
00:39:38,292 --> 00:39:39,417
Nachos are on
you this time.

820
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:43,088
Oh, those tickets aren't for you and me.
They're for you and Louis.

821
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:46,591
Oh, Sunday, the 20th. Did I mention
that I'm busy that night?

822
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:50,220
I know you are. You're busy going
to the Yankee game with Louis.

823
00:39:51,472 --> 00:39:54,891
"Son, your ego's writing
checks that your body can't cash."

824
00:39:56,143 --> 00:39:58,395
Oh, see, that's funny because now,
I'm quoting Top Gun.

825
00:39:58,521 --> 00:39:59,813
And get out
of my office.

826
00:39:59,939 --> 00:40:02,107
- Very funny. Very funny.
- Uh-huh.

827
00:40:04,193 --> 00:40:05,443
Very funny.

828
00:40:09,281 --> 00:40:11,950
Mike. Hey, you got
a second? I just...

829
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:14,285
I just want
to thank you.

830
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:15,453
Thank me? For what?

831
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:17,455
For going out of your way to help
me with the LSAT's.

832
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:20,333
Oh, it's nothing.
You would have done the same for me.

833
00:40:20,459 --> 00:40:23,545
I put a lot of
pressure on myself. I always have.

834
00:40:24,296 --> 00:40:26,631
You're right.
I'm a perfectionist.

835
00:40:27,174 --> 00:40:29,676
- It's okay.
- No, it's not okay.

836
00:40:29,802 --> 00:40:32,011
My dad,
he always wanted a son.

837
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:35,682
It was never something that he brought
up. It was just sort of there.

838
00:40:35,808 --> 00:40:38,852
And I never felt like I was good
enough for him.

839
00:40:38,978 --> 00:40:40,645
Which is why I don't
like to put myself

840
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:42,856
in positions
where I might fail.

841
00:40:43,524 --> 00:40:46,734
So I decided to just
push the LSAT's.

842
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:48,528
Give myself a little
more time to study.

843
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:51,072
That's good.
That's great.

844
00:40:51,198 --> 00:40:52,282
I think you made
the right choice.

845
00:40:53,325 --> 00:40:54,826
Really? Why?

846
00:40:55,077 --> 00:40:57,579
You were the one that's been pushing me
to take them next week.

847
00:40:57,705 --> 00:41:00,665
I just meant that I support the decision
you made. That's all.

848
00:41:01,375 --> 00:41:03,501
Why are you suddenly
changing your tune?

849
00:41:03,627 --> 00:41:06,546
Because if you're not ready,
you're not ready.

850
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:09,549
Listen, I've got to go.
I'll see you tomorrow.

851
00:41:09,675 --> 00:41:10,758
No, that's not why.

852
00:41:10,885 --> 00:41:12,218
All that interest
in Teresa.

853
00:41:12,344 --> 00:41:14,512
And then, the other
guy didn't show up. But you did.

854
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:16,055
You were going to
take the test for me.

855
00:41:16,182 --> 00:41:17,557
What guy? What are
you talking about?

856
00:41:17,683 --> 00:41:18,933
You know exactly
what I'm talking about.

857
00:41:19,059 --> 00:41:21,519
- You're the test genius, right?
- Um...

858
00:41:21,645 --> 00:41:24,272
Mike, I could pick up
the phone and find out right now.

859
00:41:30,404 --> 00:41:32,238
Yes. I took the test
for your friend, Teresa.

860
00:41:32,364 --> 00:41:34,532
That's the whole reason
you were trying to help me.

861
00:41:34,658 --> 00:41:36,576
Because you thought if you didn't,
you were going to get caught.

862
00:41:36,702 --> 00:41:38,786
- That's not true.
- How am I supposed to believe that?

863
00:41:38,913 --> 00:41:40,788
Honestly, how am I
supposed to believe anything you say,

864
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:43,500
when the whole time you were at Harvard,
studying to be a lawyer,

865
00:41:43,626 --> 00:41:45,043
you were actually
cheating for other people?

866
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:47,170
Yes. I was helping
people cheat. Okay? But...

867
00:41:47,296 --> 00:41:48,713
But what?

868
00:41:56,472 --> 00:41:58,723
But it's not
the whole story.
