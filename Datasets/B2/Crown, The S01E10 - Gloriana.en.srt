1
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:16,040
<i>...and then I swing you around there.</i>

2
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,320
Darling!

3
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:23,240
A bit smoother,
and then very, very close together.

4
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:32,560
The Duke and Duchess of York,
Your Majesty.

5
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,920
I won't see her. Just my brother.

6
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:59,640
-I gather you've made your decision.
-I have.

7
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,800
I'm afraid you won't thank me for it.

8
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,200
-Is she really worth it?
-I love her with all my heart.

9
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:17,920
Of course,
but more than your own... country?

10
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,760
Hmm?

11
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:24,320
More than your own family?
More than your own brother?

12
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,760
Yes.

13
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,000
You'll be fine.

14
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:35,160
You have a wife by your side
and heirs to spare.

15
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,120
My daughters.

16
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:44,080
This will... crush them.

17
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:53,360
If you stand down, I shall want you
and that woman gone for good.

18
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,360
Brother has indeed turned against brother.

19
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,120
Pay me to, brother...

20
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,440
and I'll be gone forever.

21
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,760
Ms. McDonald. His Majesty has asked
to see the two princesses.

22
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,040
Right. Come along, girls.

23
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,160
Lilibet.

24
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Margaret.

25
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,960
<i> Your uncle has let us all down. </i>

26
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,520
<i>He put love before family.</i>

27
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:50,920
Now I want you to promise me one thing...

28
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:56,640
that you will never put anyone or anything

29
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,000
before one another.

30
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,440
You are sisters above all else.

31
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:08,320
And must never let one another down.

32
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,080
Understood?

33
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,880
Never.

34
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,560
Never.

35
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,560
- <i> Happy birthday, Margaret.</i>
<i>-  Thank you. </i>

36
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:48,280
So, I've done what you all asked
and waited two years,

37
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,280
but now that I am 25,

38
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,040
and free to decide for myself
whom I will marry,

39
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,400
it is with great pleasure...

40
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,320
Thank you.

41
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:02,720
...great pleasure and pride,
that I say I am still committed to Peter.

42
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,640
I've kept my side of the bargain.

43
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:12,720
-Now I'm hoping you'll keep yours.
-Of course.

44
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:19,600
- Happy birthday!
- Thank you!

45
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,360
-Afternoon, Ma'am.
-Yes, thank you, Michael.

46
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:46,120
One or two bits and pieces.

47
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:50,560
A request from our neighbor,
Captain Farquharson,

48
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:53,520
wanting to lease a few acres
of Balmoral grouse land

49
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,080
in exchange for the acres
which we leased from him last year.

50
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,440
Now, I spoke to the head keeper

51
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:03,040
and he advised checking nest stocks
before responding.

52
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,120
Yes, that seems very sensible.

53
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:11,080
And a card from the Mayor of Easter Ross,
whose 70th it is this year.

54
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:14,120
Yes, he's not been well, has he?

55
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:17,920
A stroke, earlier in the year,
but he'll mend now, I'm happy to say.

56
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,360
Good.

57
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,880
That's everything from me, Ma'am.
Anything from you?

58
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:27,200
Yes. An instruction
to put things in motion,

59
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,840
as regards Group Captain Townsend's
return to the country.

60
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,160
-Ma'am?
-As you know,

61
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:36,000
my sister is now free from the constraints
of the Royal Marriages Act

62
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,920
and no longer requires
my consent to marry.

63
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,640
Yes.

64
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,880
What is it that you're not saying,
Michael?

65
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:49,360
Well, there is still the other hurdle.

66
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,640
The second part
of the Royal Marriages Act.

67
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,440
The fact that Her Royal Highness
has turned 25

68
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,240
merely means that she has reached an age

69
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:02,080
where she can give notice
of her intention to marry.

70
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,640
Not that she is free to marry.

71
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,800
What?

72
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,760
Well, if both
Houses of Parliament approve,

73
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:14,480
only then, after 12 months have expired,
can the marriage take place

74
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:19,520
and any marriage
contracted in defiance of these rules

75
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:22,600
would be void.

76
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,720
Why did no one tell me this at the time?

77
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,400
To which I hope you replied...

78
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:32,640
"It's always been there, Ma'am,
in black and white."

79
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,400
Yes, but no one drew my attention to it
or said anything.

80
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,480
This is going to be very difficult.

81
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,160
I'm sorry.

82
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:47,280
I do feel that we've left her
in a difficult spot.

83
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,920
T<i>he Queen Mother</i>
<i>always believed that two years'</i>

84
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,400
separation would be long enough
for Princess Margaret

85
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,960
to lose interest in the Group Captain

86
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:59,640
<i>and the whole thing to go away.</i>
<i>But she hasn't, and it hasn't.</i>

87
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:05,600
<i>And if anything, the Queen's dilemma</i>
<i>at the heart of it all is only more acute.</i>

88
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,400
<i>Either she puts her foot down</i>
<i>and forbids the marriage...</i>

89
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:13,960
That turns sister against sister and
splits the Royal house down the middle.

90
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:18,480
...or she permits the marriage,
setting a collision course

91
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,600
with the Church
of which she herself is the Head.

92
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:26,440
<i>Well, let me give it some more thought.</i>
<i>We'll speak in the morning.</i>

93
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,520
<i>-Good night, Michael.</i>
-Thank you, sir.

94
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,720
Take a worm.

95
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,920
- What?
- A worm.

96
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,920
With your fingers, go on.
They won't bite, they're worms, boy!

97
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,760
That's it! Good boy.

98
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:56,760
-It's wriggling.
-Of course it's wriggling, it's a worm.

99
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:59,920
It'll stop wriggling
once you put it on the hook.

100
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,040
So, I was thinking about a week on Monday.

101
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,840
What for?

102
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,960
To make the announcement.
The engagement.

103
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:19,040
Would you mind holding off?
Just a moment longer?

104
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:24,320
Everything's fine, don't worry.
There's just been a slight wrinkle.

105
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,320
What's a wrinkle?

106
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,200
Oh, no, a formality,
which no one told me about.

107
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,040
It will take a little longer
than expected.

108
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,520
Well, how much longer?
We've waited two years already.

109
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,000
-I understand.
-And Peter's been through hell.

110
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,680
-I know.
-Waiting like a martyr.

111
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,160
-Locking himself away...
-I know.

112
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,200
...seeing no one. Speaking to no one.

113
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,680
I've been crying into my pillow at night,
counting the days.

114
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,680
Why? Why?
Because we were doing you a favor...

115
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,600
-I'm aware of that!
-To spare you your blushes.

116
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,000
To make your life easier.

117
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,880
I know, and I'm going to take care of it.

118
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:56,080
Look, I probably
shouldn't have said a thing.

119
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:13,360
We're going to go up in three, OK?
One, two, three... cast!

120
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,600
Come on. Let's try again.
Hold this, please.

121
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:21,800
- I'm trying!
- Yeah, well, try harder.

122
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:24,280
- It's difficult, Daddy.
- No, it's not difficult.

123
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:27,040
Come on. If you don't try again,
you'll never catch a fish.

124
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,960
He dominates that poor boy.

125
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,400
He can be very kind, too.

126
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,840
Watch what I do.

127
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,200
And he's wonderful with Anne.

128
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:41,160
And here,
then back to here, and cast...

129
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,840
I still think he's too hard on him.

130
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,400
Taking out his own frustrations
on an innocent child.

131
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,760
I had lunch with Tommy Lascelles
last week and we both agreed

132
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:58,440
that Philip still hasn't settled
and struggles with life in your shadow.

133
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:02,240
Come on, Charles.
Let's do this. Let's have another go.

134
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,240
Tommy came up with an interesting notion.

135
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,600
Hey, there you go!

136
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,960
- Mummy, I caught one!
- Well done!

137
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,120
<i> Have you noticed something</i>
<i>about our children?</i>

138
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,720
-They're the wrong way round.
-What?

139
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,920
Well, our daughter's a boy
and our son is, God bless him, a girl.

140
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,040
-Don't be silly. He's just sensitive.
-Have you seen him fish?

141
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,520
A girl.

142
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,480
What's the matter? You seem preoccupied.

143
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:37,760
I am. I've got problems with Margaret,
and Mummy's been interfering.

144
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:40,480
-Surprise, surprise.
-Along with everything else.

145
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,760
Would you hate the idea
of going to Australia?

146
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:48,440
-What for?
-To open the Olympic Games.

147
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:54,320
The Olympics are in November, aren't they?
You can't go in November.

148
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:58,360
Oh, no, I didn't mean with me,
I meant alone. In my name.

149
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,760
Right. Whose idea was that?

150
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,920
Does it matter?

151
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,080
-Would you agree to it?
-No, I'd be gone months.

152
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:15,080
-Weeks.
-Away from you. Away from the children.

153
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,880
-Yes, but would you do it?
-No.

154
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,800
Oh, please.
Everyone just wants you to be happy.

155
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,560
Nobody gives a fig about my happiness.

156
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:25,520
Yes, they do.
They want you to be stable and fulfilled.

157
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,760
Everybody wants you happy, stable and
fulfilled. They wish I'd just disappear.

158
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:32,000
No, they just think you'd benefit
from the attention.

159
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,320
-And preferably never come back.
-No, just come back...

160
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,440
What?

161
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,280
What? Say it.

162
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:40,880
Say it. A different man?

163
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,600
No, not that.

164
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:44,800
What, then?

165
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,440
Say it, pick the adjective.

166
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,800
All right, yes.

167
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:51,800
Changed.

168
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,840
<i>Princess Margaret,</i>
<i>third in line for the throne of Britain,</i>

169
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:01,920
<i>now, 25 and legally in control</i>
<i>of her own destiny.</i>

170
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,520
<i>Pressmen and sightseers throng the lanes,</i>
<i>undeterred by the official statement</i>

171
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:11,600
<i>that no announcement is contemplated</i>
<i>at present about the Princess' future.</i>

172
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,360
<i>Meanwhile, the new Prime Minister,</i>
<i>fresh off the plane from Cairo,</i>

173
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,720
<i>travels to Scotland to brief the Queen</i>

174
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,840
<i>on the latest development</i>
<i>with Colonel Nasser...</i>

175
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:26,080
Mr. Eden! Have you come to
discuss Princess Margaret's marriage?

176
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,160
- Margaret!
- Oh, hello.

177
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,800
Where are you going?
Prime Minister's just arrived.

178
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,080
Taking to my bed.

179
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,200
I intend to remain in sulk
for at least a week.

180
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:56,640
-Oh, dear. Don't tell me, my wife?
-Yes.

181
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,480
-Your tie.
-Thank you.

182
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:03,480
It's not easy. I'm a little fed up
with her myself, truth be told.

183
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:05,640
Why? What's she done to you?

184
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,120
Don't get me started.

185
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,240
Is she making life difficult
for you and Peter?

186
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:13,120
-Yes, she wants to delay the engagement.
-Well, it serves you right quite frankly.

187
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,240
You both seem far too happy
and far too in love.

188
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,160
-Do we?
-Yes.

189
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:21,560
It's easy to be in love with someone
who's not here, isn't it?

190
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:25,840
Yes. Perhaps that's why
she's sending me away. Chin up!

191
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,600
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

192
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,240
Would you excuse me?

193
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:11,840
-The Prime Minister, Your Majesty.
-Yes.

194
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,720
I've just been reading about
your difficulty with Colonel Nasser.

195
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,640
Have the newspapers
exaggerated it terribly?

196
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,640
To a very significant degree, yes.

197
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,720
Oh, well, you can tell me
all about it in the car.

198
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,880
I thought rather
than have our audience in the study,

199
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,160
we could get some fresh air.

200
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,680
You must be longing for a walk
after your journey.

201
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:31,520
Do you have any outdoor shoes?

202
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,760
Galoshes, Ma'am.

203
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:35,360
Well, you might need something
sturdier than that. Come on!

204
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,000
She's a bit throaty, I'm afraid.

205
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,040
We've been having trouble
with the fuel pump.

206
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,840
Tell me about Colonel Nasser.

207
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:06,960
Well, the trouble started
the minute we landed in Cairo.

208
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:15,640
<i>I got off the plane and made a statement</i>
<i>to local reporters, in Arabic.</i>

209
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:20,600
-You speak Arabic?
-Very badly. I studied it at Oxford.

210
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:25,440
I am delighted to be here in Cairo

211
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:28,560
to meet with Colonel Nasser...

212
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:31,600
<i>to continue discussions</i>
<i>regarding the funding</i>

213
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,280
<i>for his grand Aswan Dam project.</i>

214
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,600
His Arabic is good.

215
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,960
<i>Thank you.</i>

216
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,520
Very good.

217
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,480
Too good.

218
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:50,280
I'm sure the Colonel
would have been charmed by that.

219
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,400
On the contrary.

220
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,480
That night,
there was a dinner at our Embassy...

221
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,760
<i>- He came in uniform.</i>
<i>-  Military uniform?</i>

222
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:00,880
<i> Yes.</i>

223
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,080
<i> Whatever for?</i>

224
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:06,120
<i> One would think the clue</i>
<i>would be in the invitation to dinner</i>

225
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,920
<i>that one would wear a dinner jacket.</i>

226
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,240
<i>He came as if we'd invited him to battle</i>
<i>and promptly behaved like that.</i>

227
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:15,040
Your Excellency Prime Minister Eden.

228
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,880
Is anything the matter?

229
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:22,600
No one told me
it was formal dress tonight.

230
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:27,760
No matter, sir. It's just a suit.

231
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,640
But the wrong suit.

232
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:34,160
Sensing his embarrassment
and wishing to spare him further blushes,

233
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,200
I tried to make the situation better.

234
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:41,840
If I was as decorated as you, sir,

235
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:47,800
I would wear my uniform all the time.
Wouldn't take it off.

236
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:52,360
You think I don't know?

237
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:59,360
That you received the Military Cross
for bravery in the First World War,

238
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:03,760
and were the youngest brigade-major
in the British Army, at 21.

239
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:09,280
You are more decorated than me...

240
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,280
Captain Eden.

241
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:19,960
That night,
the Voice of Egypt radio station in Cairo

242
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:25,160
claimed that Nasser had been deliberately
humiliated by the Imperious British.

243
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:29,240
Oh, dear. It might be worth
extending the hand of goodwill.

244
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,720
Indeed we are, Ma'am.

245
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:35,040
We're bending over backwards
to help him fund this dam project.

246
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,960
Things here could do with
a little settling, too.

247
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,520
My sister's engagement.

248
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,360
This was their favorite place.

249
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,800
They would ride out here together.

250
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,400
And put a single stone down
for each time they met.

251
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:08,320
I thought this would be the perfect spot
for us to discuss the matter.

252
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:14,040
You see,
I gave my sister my assurance

253
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:17,880
that if she waited until the age of 25,
she could do as she likes.

254
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:21,320
Now I discover that's not true,

255
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:24,320
and that she still needs to wait a year
to get permission from Parliament.

256
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:28,240
Which is not the advice
that I originally received.

257
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,320
Yes.

258
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:36,560
And I'm afraid to say that,
even if she were to ask that permission,

259
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,920
I cannot guarantee that she would get it.

260
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,160
Why?

261
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:44,000
Because a good many
remain opposed to the idea

262
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,760
on religious grounds.

263
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,640
Then advise me.

264
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:59,080
Group Captain Townsend will be leaving
Brussels and returning home shortly,

265
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:02,880
having done exactly
what we asked him to do.

266
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:07,560
How can I keep my word after I gave it
knowing only half the facts?

267
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:13,560
Let me take the temperature
of the Cabinet.

268
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,520
We must not forget
that times are changing.

269
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,320
Morality is changing.

270
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,840
The country is changing.

271
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:51,920
So, it was your idea, was it?
Dispatching me to the penal colonies?

272
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,760
If you mean entrusting you
to go to Melbourne

273
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,640
to open the Olympic Games alone,
actually it was Tommy Lascelles.

274
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,040
Oh, your puppet. I might have guessed.

275
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,640
-And you ought to be flattered.
-To be trusted to cut a ribbon?

276
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:09,280
-To be given that level of freedom.
-What freedom? I have no freedom.

277
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,360
You have more freedom
than any consort in history.

278
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:15,520
And you repay it by scowling and skulking
like an adolescent.

279
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,480
So go.

280
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:24,680
Have some time in the spotlight, be the
main attraction, and enjoy the attention.

281
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,600
Hopefully it will do you some good.
You might finally be less resentful

282
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:32,520
and more supportive
of my daughter in her duty.

283
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,880
-When's the wedding day, sir?
-Are you going to make an announcement?

284
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,960
Anything you'd like to share,
Mr. Townsend?

285
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:05,920
Mr. Townsend! Captain Townsend!
When's the wedding day?

286
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,320
-Prime Minister.
-Michael.

287
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,520
Sir.

288
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:37,080
<i> I discussed the matter this morning</i>
<i>with the Attorney General</i>

289
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:42,280
and he advised
that there was no easy way

290
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:45,960
around the governing rules
of the Royal Marriages Act.

291
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,400
Furthermore...

292
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:54,840
several senior members of Cabinet
remain violently opposed.

293
00:23:55,880 --> 00:24:00,600
Indeed, Lord Salisbury has made it clear
that he would resign from Government,

294
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:05,640
rather than submit to what he considers
a subversion of the Church's teachings...

295
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:12,720
the Holy Sacrament of Marriage
and the decay of moral standards.

296
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:19,960
-But I realize this doesn't help you.
-No.

297
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,960
So if it is...

298
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:28,240
Your Majesty's intention
to support your sister,

299
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,480
come what may?

300
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:31,920
It is.

301
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,360
Then the best I can offer is to...

302
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,800
place a Bill of Renunciation
before Parliament.

303
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:46,160
It would deprive her of all her rights,
privileges and income.

304
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:51,680
She would have to be married
in a civil ceremony abroad.

305
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:57,640
And be obliged to live out of the country
for several years.

306
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,960
But you will have kept your word.

307
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,240
And she will have prevailed

308
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:10,280
and will be Mrs. Peter Townsend.

309
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:18,560
Of course. That's the strategy.

310
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,520
What strategy?

311
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:25,840
To force me into that choice and bank
on the fact that I would never do it.

312
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,760
"Oh, smart set Margaret.
Good time Margaret."

313
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:30,240
"She could never survive
without the trimmings?" I could.

314
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:34,520
I could live perfectly happily
without the staff, without the car,

315
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:37,080
without the parties,
without the attention.

316
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,200
Without the money. Effortlessly.

317
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:43,000
I am more than my title,
than these privileges.

318
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,560
Peter wouldn't want it anyway.

319
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:49,600
So if that's what's on offer, I'll give up
my title and we'll leave the country.

320
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:54,080
It's not what I want for you.
So please think about it.

321
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:56,280
I mean really, really think about it.

322
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,840
Fine.

323
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:05,600
And while I'm thinking about it,
perhaps you could think about this.

324
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,400
I have a country that is for me.

325
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,480
Newspapers that sympathize with me.

326
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:17,640
I represent what a growing majority want.
The future, not the past.

327
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:22,400
A kinder, more tolerant attitude
to marriage and divorce.

328
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,800
That's not me.

329
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,200
Fine.

330
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,600
Then a government in your name.

331
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,840
Slow down here.

332
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:37,400
They tried to bribe my butler.
A hundred pounds! Can you imagine?

333
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:41,160
-For a photograph of the two of you.
-It's all rather too much, isn't it?

334
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:49,080
The house is under siege.
And you're the cause of it all, old boy.

335
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:54,200
Not bad, sweeping up
the most eligible woman in the world.

336
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:58,280
-Shall we?
-Yes.

337
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:01,920
-Peter?
-No, you dance, darling. I'll go to bed.

338
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,960
-You're sure?
-I'm quite sure.

339
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:48,320
-Hello.
-Hello.

340
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:03,200
-Everyone is still dancing.
-Then why are you here?

341
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:05,520
To tell you that I love you.

342
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,480
Thank you.

343
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:13,280
-And that they're just children.
-I know.

344
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:16,400
-And I'm mad for you.
-Me too.

345
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,200
<i>Her Royal Highness</i>
<i>Princess Margaret</i>

346
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:52,000
<i>and wartime fighter ace</i>
<i>Group Captain Townsend</i>

347
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:55,760
<i>were important weekend visitors</i>
<i>at Allenby Park near Windsor.</i>

348
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,720
<i>Pressmen and sightseers</i>
<i>hoping for a glimpse of the couple</i>

349
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,640
<i>were undeterred</i>
<i>by the official statements</i>

350
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:03,240
<i>that no announcement is expected.</i>

351
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:06,320
<i>But whatever the answer to the question</i>
<i>that millions are asking,</i>

352
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:11,040
<i>no one can doubt the warmth and sympathy</i>
<i>countless ordinary people have</i>

353
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:15,000
<i>for the Queen's sister</i>
<i>and the former equerry to Her Majesty.</i>

354
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,800
Since our last meeting,
I've been thinking a great deal

355
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:45,280
about something that my father said
to Princess Margaret and myself

356
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,240
at the time of the abdication.

357
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:51,760
He made us swear, as sisters,

358
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:55,200
never to put anything or anyone
before one another,

359
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:58,680
in the way that he felt his brother had.

360
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:05,080
It's an oath that we both made
and that... we intend to keep.

361
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:08,360
But I can't see how I'm to honor it.

362
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:13,440
It is my duty as Queen to refuse
Margaret marriage to a divorced man.

363
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:15,440
Everyone advises me so.

364
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:22,800
And yet I will be breaking a promise,
not only to my sister...

365
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,800
but also to my late father.

366
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:36,040
And the one body of people who might make
it possible for me to keep my promise...

367
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:38,800
is Cabinet.

368
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:46,480
A group whom I've learned count no fewer
than four divorced men in their number.

369
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:53,080
-Yes.
-Yourself included, Prime Minister.

370
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,200
Indeed.

371
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:58,160
Now, I wonder, in light of this,

372
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:03,960
whether you might go back
and use your considerable influence

373
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:08,160
and ask your Cabinet colleagues
if they might reconsider

374
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,680
their decision to oppose the marriage.

375
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,640
Certainly, Ma'am.

376
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,560
Although, I feel I should warn you

377
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:21,440
that there still will be the Church.

378
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:24,760
Yes, well, I'll see to that.

379
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:31,360
The Archbishops of Canterbury, and York.

380
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:37,960
The Bishop of Durham,
and is that Winchester?

381
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,120
Bath and Wells, Ma'am.

382
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:45,880
-The big guns.
-The four horsemen of the apocalypse.

383
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:53,360
<i>Marriage is a sacrament of God.</i>

384
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:57,560
The cornerstone
of our Christian family life.

385
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,800
Its foundation and its rock.

386
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:05,920
And according to the Canon law
of the Church of England...

387
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,200
indissoluble.

388
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:12,920
Put simply, there are no circumstances

389
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:17,880
where the Church might permit
the remarriage of divorced persons

390
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:21,680
while the husband or wife
of the former marriage is still alive.

391
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:26,840
Even if he was the innocent party?

392
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:29,360
No circumstances at all.

393
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,640
That makes my position very difficult.

394
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,560
To forbid the marriage
would risk breaking up my family.

395
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:39,080
Your Majesty, as Queen...

396
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:44,640
you are<i> Fidei defensor...</i>

397
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:49,960
defender of the faith.

398
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:56,280
That was the oath you made
at the coronation.

399
00:33:56,360 --> 00:34:00,440
<i>I married the man of my choice.</i>
<i>I'd like to think she could do the same.</i>

400
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:03,480
<i> Well, the way I look at it,</i>
<i>if she really likes the fella...</i>

401
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:05,920
Time to concede, it would seem.

402
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:11,000
-Give the people what they want.
-Do they really know what they want?

403
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:16,240
<i>Quite frankly, the world today</i>
<i>isn't what it was a few years ago,</i>

404
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,880
<i>and he was not the guilty party...</i>

405
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,200
I think they're making it very clear.

406
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:24,200
Well, the Archbishops
just made themselves clear, too.

407
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:28,560
You don't need to listen to them, surely?

408
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:31,720
As Head of the Church of England,
I thought I might.

409
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:32,800
Oh.

410
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:36,320
Well, in the name of the people
that live with you and love you,

411
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:39,440
might I suggest
not being Head of the Church for a minute.

412
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:42,200
Or Head of State,
or Head of the Commonwealth of Nations,

413
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,440
or the Army, or the Navy,
or the Government,

414
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:47,800
or the Fount of Justice,
or the whole damn circus, frankly.

415
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:52,360
-And be what?
-A living, breathing thing, a woman.

416
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:54,880
A sister. A daughter. A wife.

417
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,280
All ready for you, Your Majesty.

418
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:12,840
Elizabeth...

419
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,320
I've been hoping to hear from you.

420
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:34,080
I've found myself hovering
by the phone for days.

421
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:37,600
<i>-Is it about Margaret?</i>
-Yes.

422
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,200
<i>The French are very much for her.</i>

423
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:42,000
<i>At least Paris is,</i>
<i>which is the only France that matters.</i>

424
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:44,040
<i>And are you for her, too?</i>

425
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:47,440
For Margaret, '<i>la Marianne,</i>'
how can I not be?

426
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:51,320
I share with her the fate
of having a great love

427
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:55,440
that captured
much of the country's imagination,

428
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,880
only to have it forbidden
by the establishment.

429
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:01,280
So, naturally, my sympathy is with her.

430
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,040
I see.

431
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:09,280
<i>But there is also</i>
<i>the other great love of my life...</i>

432
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,640
<i>the Crown.</i>

433
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:15,600
<i>And protecting that crown.</i>

434
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:21,000
<i>And I imagine you find yourself</i>
<i>in a difficult position now.</i>

435
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:23,440
Split down the middle.

436
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:29,080
One half is sister. One half is Queen.

437
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:30,160
<i>Exactly.</i>

438
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:34,680
A strange, hybrid creature.

439
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:38,960
Like a sphinx or Gamayun.

440
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,000
As I am Ganesha or Minotaur.

441
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,760
<i>We are half-people.</i>

442
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:53,120
<i>Ripped from the pages</i>
<i>of some bizarre mythology,</i>

443
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:57,000
<i>the two sides within us, human and crown</i>

444
00:36:57,080 --> 00:37:02,640
<i>engaged in a fearful civil war,</i>
<i>which never ends.</i>

445
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:08,600
And which blights
our every human transaction as...

446
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:11,600
as brother, husband...

447
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:16,760
<i>sister, wife, mother.</i>

448
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:22,800
I understand the agony you feel
and I am here to tell you,

449
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,240
it will never leave you.

450
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:29,160
<i>I will always be half-King.</i>

451
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:35,720
<i>My tragedy is that... I have no Kingdom.</i>

452
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:41,440
You have it. And you must protect it.

453
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:35,440
Her Royal Highness, Princess Margaret.

454
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:52,440
I've asked you here...

455
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:58,200
to say that
I've given the matter thought.

456
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:00,760
A great deal of thought.

457
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:06,680
The issue of your marriage has,
for the past weeks, months,

458
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:10,640
gone to the very heart of
a great number of things.

459
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:15,800
The country, morality, divorce.

460
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:22,680
But also something closer to home.

461
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,480
Who I am.

462
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:29,160
What I am.

463
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:33,080
And your marriage to Peter...

464
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:36,240
-Wait, I...
-No, please, Margaret.

465
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:44,280
It doesn't come naturally for me to
speak like this, so please let me finish.

466
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:50,160
It's involved going against
members of our family,

467
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:53,360
against senior courtiers, against Cabinet.

468
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:59,520
You know how I hate confrontation,
or mess, or dereliction of duty.

469
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:00,600
But...

470
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:07,280
I was prepared to go through it all
and support you, as a sister.

471
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:09,360
Because I'd given you my word.

472
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,000
But...

473
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:28,560
But?

474
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,160
But what?

475
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,080
But I realized...

476
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,080
as Queen...

477
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,080
that I have no choice.

478
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:59,640
I cannot allow you to marry Peter
and remain part of this family.

479
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:04,720
That is my decision.

480
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:26,600
In defiance of the pledge
you made to our father?

481
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:32,400
And the pledge you gave to me.

482
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:38,120
Yes.

483
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:03,000
Will you forgive me?

484
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:10,040
-If you deny me the man I love?
-If I put duty before family.

485
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:12,160
Would you forgive anyone
who denied you Philip?

486
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:17,480
-It doesn't compare.
-It compares exactly.

487
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:21,560
In marrying Philip, I wasn't violating
the scriptures or offending the Church.

488
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:34,120
I'm so sorry.

489
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:39,480
- You will love others.
- No. Never.

490
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:49,720
Peter is the only one.

491
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:54,200
I understand that it feels like that now,
but Margaret...

492
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:58,200
I know I appear strong, but I'm not.

493
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:06,560
Peter is the only one who knows how to...

494
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:09,560
calm me, to reassure me, protect me.
Don't tell me you understand that.

495
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:13,200
You don't know for a minute
what it is to be...

496
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:16,880
unhinged.

497
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:20,360
Be flailing about.

498
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,800
Well, Peter is the only one...

499
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:32,640
who can hold me together.

500
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:40,440
Without him...

501
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:46,640
I'm lost.

502
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:48,600
I will never forgive her.

503
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:58,040
And I will never marry anyone else. Ever.

504
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:01,000
You're the only one.

505
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:22,720
<i> I would like it to be known</i>
<i>that, Her Royal Highness,</i>

506
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:24,520
<i>the Princess Margaret and I...</i>

507
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,040
have decided not to marry.

508
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:39,760
<i>Mindful of the Church's teaching that</i>
<i>Christian marriage is indissoluble...</i>

509
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:47,240
<i>and accepting my position</i>
<i>as a divorced man...</i>

510
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:52,080
<i>and knowing how deeply religious faith</i>

511
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:56,840
and commitment to the Church runs
within the Princess...

512
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:02,160
<i>we have resolved</i>
<i>to make the ultimate sacrifice</i>

513
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:05,040
<i>and break off our relationship</i>
<i>with immediate effect.</i>

514
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:08,240
<i>Her Royal Highness,</i>
<i>the Princess Margaret and I</i>

515
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:12,280
<i>are strengthened by the unfailing support</i>
<i>of the Royal Family,</i>

516
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:13,920
<i>whom it has been my honor</i>

517
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:19,000
and my privilege to serve
for these last ten years.

518
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:26,720
I will now return to Brussels to continue
my important work as air attaché.

519
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:30,640
Mr. Townsend,
would you like to make a comment?

520
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:38,800
<i>The 19 days between</i>
<i>Peter Townsend's return to London</i>

521
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:43,040
<i>and the Princess' decision</i>
<i>were a period of mounting suspense.</i>

522
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:45,520
<i>Now she has put her Royal duty first.</i>

523
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:49,000
<i>Outside Clarence House,</i>
<i>the day after the announcement,</i>

524
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:51,720
<i>people hoped to see and encourage her.</i>

525
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:54,520
<i>The hearts of all Britain</i>
<i>and the Commonwealth are</i>

526
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:56,040
<i>with the young Princess,</i>

527
00:46:56,120 --> 00:46:59,400
<i>who has chosen not self, but country.</i>

528
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:07,440
<i>The Group Captain flies back to Brussels,</i>
<i>the end of a story of love and duty.</i>

529
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:09,800
<i>With duty prevailing.</i>

530
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:19,360
Apparently,
the Prime Minister called Nasser

531
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:21,720
in an attempt to defuse the situation,

532
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:25,520
but it seems the Egyptian leader
took offence again.

533
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:26,960
Why this time?

534
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:32,600
Because the PM refused to speak a word
of Arabic, insisting on speaking English.

535
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:35,440
What's the matter with that?

536
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:37,640
Aha.

537
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:40,800
Well, it seems Nasser hadn't arranged
for a translator to be present,

538
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:44,560
which left him exposed since he
doesn't speak sufficiently good English.

539
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:46,160
He felt tricked and humiliated

540
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:49,960
and has taken the whole thing
as a terrible affront.

541
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:53,760
There is some personal history
between the two men, I believe.

542
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:56,840
Oh, dear.
Well, I do hope it all calms down.

543
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,120
-I'm off.
-Where are you going?

544
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:17,200
We are ready for Her Majesty.

545
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:20,800
To meet the president of the
Olympic Committee, as instructed.

546
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:25,920
They now suggest I combine
opening the games with a Royal Tour,

547
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:29,160
stay away even longer, five months.

548
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:34,360
A long way to go. A long time for
a father to be away from his children.

549
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:42,240
But no, if it gives me time
to reflect and work out my priorities

550
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:44,360
and to settle, not just in the marriage,

551
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:47,760
but you know, generally,
it'll be worth it.

552
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:50,920
Don't be like that.
Everyone's just trying to help.

553
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,400
Oh, yes, by putting a problem
on a boat to Australia

554
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:58,440
and hoping it sorts itself out
or better still, sinks.

555
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:02,960
You know it is possible
that you might enjoy it, and thank me.

556
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:07,560
Don't dress betrayal up as a favor.

557
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:20,160
Better go. Can't stand around chatting.

558
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:31,680
-Your Majesty!
-Will you be back late?

559
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:47,120
I'll be right with you, Cecil.

560
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:00,000
-Good afternoon.
-Thank you, Your Majesty.

561
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:27,800
<i>Britain and the West despise Arabs.</i>

562
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:32,080
<i>Prime Minister Eden thinks</i>
<i>he can insult us.</i>

563
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:34,600
You can leave now, thank you.

564
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:37,360
<i>We will fight to the last drop</i>
<i>of our blood.</i>

565
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:09,520
Try standing up, Ma'am.

566
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:43,920
That's it, there.

567
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:50,120
All hail sage Lady,
whom a grateful Isle hath blessed.

568
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:54,680
Not moving, not breathing.

569
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:59,720
Our very own goddess. Glorious Gloriana.

570
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:03,960
Forgetting Elizabeth Windsor now.

571
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:09,320
Now only Elizabeth Regina. Yes.
