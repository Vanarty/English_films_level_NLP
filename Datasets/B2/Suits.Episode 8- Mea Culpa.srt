1
00:00:07,465 --> 00:00:10,326
So we started this thing I was
just doing it to kiss your ass

2
00:00:10,645 --> 00:00:11,912
so Jessica would forgive me,

3
00:00:11,947 --> 00:00:12,947
but you're the real deal.

4
00:00:12,948 --> 00:00:14,415
As far as I can tell, Jack Soloff

5
00:00:14,449 --> 00:00:15,889
is holding up his end of the bargain.

6
00:00:15,917 --> 00:00:17,184
He's doing more than that.

7
00:00:17,219 --> 00:00:18,986
He just sent out an email nominating you

8
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:20,254
- for junior partner.
- What?

9
00:00:20,288 --> 00:00:21,522
I'm not sending out a press release

10
00:00:21,556 --> 00:00:24,358
announcing Mike Ross of Harvard
just got promoted.

11
00:00:24,392 --> 00:00:25,493
What is this?

12
00:00:25,527 --> 00:00:27,127
Am I mistaken, or did we
not have this discussion?

13
00:00:27,352 --> 00:00:28,734
Don't call me again.

14
00:00:28,787 --> 00:00:30,453
You need to tell Louis you've
been sleeping with Esther.

15
00:00:30,488 --> 00:00:31,687
We slept together one time.

16
00:00:31,689 --> 00:00:32,822
What difference does that make?

17
00:00:32,874 --> 00:00:34,294
You promised him you wouldn't do it at all.

18
00:00:34,295 --> 00:00:35,494
I need to tell you something.

19
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:37,263
- You made a promise to me!
- I'm telling you.

20
00:00:37,298 --> 00:00:39,498
Because he's so messed up
from whatever goddamn thing

21
00:00:39,534 --> 00:00:40,833
happened to him in his pathetic
childhood, he can't...

22
00:00:40,885 --> 00:00:42,068
Shut the hell up!

23
00:01:05,643 --> 00:01:07,276
Get me Jerry Myers on the phone.

24
00:01:07,312 --> 00:01:09,078
Jerry Myers?

25
00:01:09,407 --> 00:01:11,741
- Louis, what happened?
- I'll tell you what happened.

26
00:01:11,793 --> 00:01:12,876
Harvey took a goddamn swing at me.

27
00:01:12,911 --> 00:01:14,861
- That's what happened.
- Oh, my God.

28
00:01:14,896 --> 00:01:17,017
Yeah, "Oh, my God," I'm gonna
sue the shit out of him.

29
00:01:17,047 --> 00:01:18,413
Okay, Louis, you're hurt.

30
00:01:18,448 --> 00:01:20,281
The first thing you need to do
is get some ice and calm down.

31
00:01:20,317 --> 00:01:22,417
Did you not just hear me?

32
00:01:22,419 --> 00:01:25,887
He hit me and then he threw me
into a coffee table,

33
00:01:25,922 --> 00:01:28,423
so I am going to sue the shit out of him!

34
00:01:28,458 --> 00:01:29,774
I don't think suing Harvey is the answer.

35
00:01:29,826 --> 00:01:32,760
Of course you don't,
because you want to protect him

36
00:01:32,762 --> 00:01:36,785
like you did when you lied to me
about what he did to Esther.

37
00:01:36,885 --> 00:01:39,953
I told Harvey to tell you himself.

38
00:01:39,955 --> 00:01:42,522
And I lied to you because I knew
something like this would happen

39
00:01:42,574 --> 00:01:44,508
if you didn't hear it directly from him.

40
00:01:44,543 --> 00:01:46,893
Well, it did happen, Donna.

41
00:01:49,898 --> 00:01:52,399
Now get me Jerry Myers on the phone.

42
00:01:52,434 --> 00:01:54,568
You want me to do that, I will.

43
00:01:56,471 --> 00:02:00,173
But you've always said we're a family,

44
00:02:00,209 --> 00:02:03,109
and families keep things
like this in the family.

45
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,500
- Hey.
- Hey.

46
00:02:12,858 --> 00:02:14,841
I'm not sure if
congratulations are in order,

47
00:02:14,877 --> 00:02:15,976
but since we have no other choice,

48
00:02:16,011 --> 00:02:18,378
I'm going to choose congratulations.

49
00:02:18,414 --> 00:02:20,030
- You saw the memo?
- I did.

50
00:02:20,082 --> 00:02:21,415
You're making partner.

51
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:23,350
No, Rachel, I'm not.

52
00:02:23,385 --> 00:02:24,451
What do you mean?

53
00:02:24,503 --> 00:02:27,154
Jessica told me to turn it down.

54
00:02:27,189 --> 00:02:28,949
Said it would draw too
much attention to me.

55
00:02:29,388 --> 00:02:30,820
That's crazy.

56
00:02:30,856 --> 00:02:32,272
If you turn it down, you'll draw
even more attention to yourself.

57
00:02:32,324 --> 00:02:33,440
That's exactly what I told her.

58
00:02:33,492 --> 00:02:34,774
And what did she say?

59
00:02:34,826 --> 00:02:36,159
She said that if I'm smart
enough to be a lawyer

60
00:02:36,195 --> 00:02:37,861
without going to law school,
I should be smart enough

61
00:02:37,896 --> 00:02:39,462
to come up with an excuse to turn it down.

62
00:02:39,498 --> 00:02:40,530
Oh, that's bullshit.

63
00:02:40,566 --> 00:02:43,366
You think I don't want this?

64
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:46,239
I do.

65
00:02:46,274 --> 00:02:49,976
But we've always known
I was never gonna make partner.

66
00:02:49,978 --> 00:02:51,577
Okay.
What are you gonna do?

67
00:02:51,777 --> 00:02:55,012
I am gonna do the exact
opposite of what I usually do.

68
00:02:55,112 --> 00:02:56,845
Instead of trying to prove Jessica wrong,

69
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,560
I'm gonna come up with a legitimate excuse

70
00:02:58,582 --> 00:03:01,850
for why I can't accept it.

71
00:03:03,988 --> 00:03:05,687
Jessica,

72
00:03:05,723 --> 00:03:07,422
if I knew you were coming over,

73
00:03:07,424 --> 00:03:09,224
I would have made us some tequila and eggs.

74
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:10,776
And I would have thrown them in your face.

75
00:03:10,811 --> 00:03:12,131
Well, that doesn't seem very nice.

76
00:03:12,146 --> 00:03:13,729
I cooked them just like you like them.

77
00:03:13,731 --> 00:03:15,397
You think this is funny?

78
00:03:15,712 --> 00:03:17,045
You assaulted a name partner.

79
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,713
And I'm making jokes
because I don't want to hear it,

80
00:03:18,765 --> 00:03:19,981
because he got what he deserved.

81
00:03:20,017 --> 00:03:21,800
I don't care if he
deserved a court martial.

82
00:03:21,835 --> 00:03:24,953
That kind of behavior
cannot exist in my firm!

83
00:03:24,988 --> 00:03:27,055
- You mean our firm?
- If it's our firm,

84
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:29,324
then it's Louis's firm, too.

85
00:03:29,602 --> 00:03:31,903
Okay, you made your point.

86
00:03:31,938 --> 00:03:33,020
I won't do it again.

87
00:03:33,072 --> 00:03:34,906
You think I came all the way down here

88
00:03:34,908 --> 00:03:36,340
just to give you a speech?

89
00:03:36,376 --> 00:03:38,576
You're taking two weeks starting tomorrow.

90
00:03:38,611 --> 00:03:39,877
Me going on vacation

91
00:03:39,913 --> 00:03:41,646
isn't gonna stop Louis from coming at me.

92
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:43,972
Yes, it is, because if you set foot

93
00:03:44,007 --> 00:03:45,957
anywhere near the office
in the next two weeks,

94
00:03:45,992 --> 00:03:48,426
I guarantee he will call
for a three-month suspension.

95
00:03:48,461 --> 00:03:49,461
Then don't let him.

96
00:03:49,462 --> 00:03:50,912
Harvey, there are bylaws in place,

97
00:03:50,947 --> 00:03:53,831
and the only way to stop him
is you being on vacation.

98
00:03:53,867 --> 00:03:55,233
The only problem with that is,

99
00:03:55,576 --> 00:03:57,476
everyone knows I don't take vacations.

100
00:03:57,528 --> 00:03:58,528
Oh.

101
00:03:58,562 --> 00:04:01,780
Then why am I holding your request

102
00:04:01,782 --> 00:04:04,166
that you filled out two months ago?

103
00:04:04,218 --> 00:04:05,784
Louis is never going to buy that.

104
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:08,420
I don't give a shit whether
he buys it or not.

105
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:10,356
But before you go on your little trip,

106
00:04:10,391 --> 00:04:13,025
you're going to go to him
with your tail between your legs

107
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:17,096
and tell him that you were 100% wrong.

108
00:04:26,326 --> 00:04:27,959
Jessica, hey.

109
00:04:27,994 --> 00:04:29,260
What can I do for you?

110
00:04:29,296 --> 00:04:32,130
Well, you can tell me
why you nominated Mike Ross

111
00:04:32,182 --> 00:04:34,699
for junior partner and didn't
think to run it by me.

112
00:04:34,751 --> 00:04:36,401
It's an open nomination.

113
00:04:36,436 --> 00:04:37,519
I didn't think I had to.

114
00:04:37,554 --> 00:04:39,204
I didn't say you had to.

115
00:04:39,239 --> 00:04:42,023
- I asked you why you didn't.
- I don't understand.

116
00:04:42,058 --> 00:04:44,371
You were the one who forced
him to work with me.

117
00:04:44,397 --> 00:04:47,215
I said work with him,
not nominate him behind my back

118
00:04:47,267 --> 00:04:48,733
just to stick it to Harvey.

119
00:04:48,768 --> 00:04:52,887
Jessica, how many times are we
gonna have this conversation?

120
00:04:52,923 --> 00:04:55,256
You gave me a chance
to make peace and I took it.

121
00:04:55,308 --> 00:04:57,058
And I still haven't heard one good reason

122
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:58,943
why Mike shouldn't be promoted.

123
00:04:58,979 --> 00:05:03,231
Oh, I didn't say he didn't
deserve to be partner.

124
00:05:03,233 --> 00:05:05,900
Then how about I retract my memo

125
00:05:05,902 --> 00:05:07,902
and let Harvey nominate him instead?

126
00:05:07,904 --> 00:05:10,571
Unless there's some reason
why you don't want that either.

127
00:05:10,573 --> 00:05:12,824
Because instead of talking
to me about this,

128
00:05:12,876 --> 00:05:15,743
you should be talking to me
about what happened last night

129
00:05:15,745 --> 00:05:17,745
between Louis and Harvey.

130
00:05:48,767 --> 00:05:55,267
== sync, corrected by
<font color=#00FF00>elderman</font> == <font color=#00FFFF>@elder_man</font>

131
00:05:59,354 --> 00:06:01,939
- How's it going?
- Not great.

132
00:06:01,991 --> 00:06:03,857
You haven't found a way
to turn down the nomination?

133
00:06:03,859 --> 00:06:06,026
Oh, I've found 15 ways to turn it down.

134
00:06:06,028 --> 00:06:08,028
But none of them are good enough.

135
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:10,414
Come on, one of them has to be good enough.

136
00:06:10,449 --> 00:06:12,116
Rachel, it's not about the excuse,

137
00:06:12,168 --> 00:06:14,034
it's about me being able
to look these people in the eye

138
00:06:14,086 --> 00:06:15,452
and convince them that it's true,

139
00:06:15,504 --> 00:06:16,920
and I can't do that.

140
00:06:16,956 --> 00:06:18,872
Okay.

141
00:06:18,924 --> 00:06:20,207
What are you gonna do?

142
00:06:20,209 --> 00:06:21,592
I don't know.

143
00:06:21,627 --> 00:06:23,844
I do.

144
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:26,346
You're doing this.

145
00:06:26,382 --> 00:06:27,514
As managing partner,

146
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:30,134
I am officially giving you your first case.

147
00:06:30,186 --> 00:06:32,886
- Oh my God.
- What?

148
00:06:32,938 --> 00:06:35,639
It's tradition that the managing partner

149
00:06:35,691 --> 00:06:39,526
to give all new junior partners
their first case.

150
00:06:39,562 --> 00:06:41,612
- Is that what this is?
- Yes, it is.

151
00:06:41,647 --> 00:06:43,530
Congratulations, Mike.

152
00:06:43,566 --> 00:06:45,115
It may not be what I wanted,

153
00:06:45,151 --> 00:06:47,234
but I really did mean it
when I said you deserve it.

154
00:06:47,236 --> 00:06:50,120
Thank you, Jessica.

155
00:06:54,126 --> 00:06:55,542
I can't believe that just really happened.

156
00:06:55,578 --> 00:06:59,830
You are the youngest junior
partner the firm has ever had.

157
00:06:59,882 --> 00:07:03,383
Mike, I'm so proud of you.

158
00:07:03,419 --> 00:07:05,752
Well, that means there's
only one thing left to do.

159
00:07:05,804 --> 00:07:07,671
Rachel Elizabeth Zane,

160
00:07:07,723 --> 00:07:11,592
will you be the associate
on my first case as partner?

161
00:07:11,644 --> 00:07:15,095
Yes.
Yes.

162
00:07:15,097 --> 00:07:18,432
A thousand times, yes.

163
00:07:18,484 --> 00:07:19,566
I don't understand.

164
00:07:19,602 --> 00:07:22,736
Are you saying you're sorry you hit Louis?

165
00:07:22,771 --> 00:07:26,106
I'm saying I'm sorry I
didn't punch him harder.

166
00:07:26,108 --> 00:07:27,608
In that case, I think taking two weeks off

167
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:28,859
is the best thing right now.

168
00:07:28,911 --> 00:07:29,826
Because your emotions

169
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:31,345
are completely ruling you.

170
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:34,114
Wanting to shut Louis up
isn't being ruled by emotions.

171
00:07:34,149 --> 00:07:35,315
It's being human.

172
00:07:35,351 --> 00:07:36,917
And there are other ways you
could have tried to do that.

173
00:07:36,952 --> 00:07:38,652
- Such as?
- Walking out the door, for one.

174
00:07:38,687 --> 00:07:40,387
I'm not walking out of my own office.

175
00:07:40,422 --> 00:07:41,505
Why not?

176
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:43,189
Because when someone points a gun at you,

177
00:07:43,289 --> 00:07:44,855
you don't turn around and run away.

178
00:07:44,891 --> 00:07:47,625
You take it out of their hand
and you point it right back.

179
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:49,293
Well, sometimes the best way to get someone

180
00:07:49,328 --> 00:07:53,063
to stop firing bullets at you
is to take off your armor.

181
00:07:53,099 --> 00:07:54,949
What the hell kind of bullets
are you talking about?

182
00:07:55,001 --> 00:07:56,467
Emotional ones.

183
00:07:57,051 --> 00:08:00,452
Harvey, Louis lashed out at you
because he was feeling pain,

184
00:08:00,488 --> 00:08:02,988
and instead of showing you his
hurt, he covered it with anger.

185
00:08:03,023 --> 00:08:04,556
Well, that's his problem, not mine.

186
00:08:04,592 --> 00:08:06,692
Actually, I'd say you two
have exactly the same problem.

187
00:08:06,727 --> 00:08:07,926
Excuse me?

188
00:08:07,962 --> 00:08:10,110
You did the same thing to him
that he did to you.

189
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:12,330
Instead of showing your hurt,
you lashed out in anger.

190
00:08:12,346 --> 00:08:14,179
The only difference is,
is that you did it with fists.

191
00:08:14,181 --> 00:08:15,480
He did it with words.

192
00:08:15,515 --> 00:08:17,666
Are you saying that I should
tell him I'm in therapy

193
00:08:17,718 --> 00:08:18,850
and talk about my issues with him

194
00:08:18,885 --> 00:08:21,619
so we can sit around singing<i> Kumbayah?</i>

195
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,940
I'm saying that if you think
Louis should be sorry

196
00:08:23,975 --> 00:08:25,742
for lashing out at you,
the least you can do

197
00:08:25,777 --> 00:08:28,444
is apologize for lashing back at him.

198
00:08:36,101 --> 00:08:37,767
Louis.
How are you?

199
00:08:37,802 --> 00:08:39,469
Cut the small talk.
I'm not interested.

200
00:08:39,504 --> 00:08:41,604
In that case, what can I do for you?

201
00:08:41,656 --> 00:08:43,973
You can start by telling me
how Harvey's being punished.

202
00:08:44,009 --> 00:08:46,526
- That's between me and Harvey.
- That's funny.

203
00:08:46,561 --> 00:08:48,778
When he was attacking me,
it was between me and Harvey,

204
00:08:48,813 --> 00:08:50,196
and I want to know
what you're gonna do about it.

205
00:08:50,248 --> 00:08:52,248
And I just said, it's
none of your business.

206
00:08:52,283 --> 00:08:53,533
Then as managing partner, you should know

207
00:08:53,568 --> 00:08:55,251
that I'm suing your favorite son

208
00:08:55,286 --> 00:08:58,021
for assault and battery.

209
00:08:58,527 --> 00:09:01,061
Louis, you haven't filed that yet,

210
00:09:01,096 --> 00:09:03,563
so why don't you tell me
what the hell you really want?

211
00:09:03,599 --> 00:09:05,665
I want Harvey suspended.

212
00:09:05,667 --> 00:09:08,685
Three months, no pay, no access to clients.

213
00:09:08,737 --> 00:09:10,303
That's not punishing Harvey.

214
00:09:10,339 --> 00:09:11,505
That's punishing all of us.

215
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:12,822
Well, then I'll do it myself,

216
00:09:12,858 --> 00:09:14,698
which I have the right
to do under the bylaws.

217
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:16,776
Louis, I was hoping you'd calm down.

218
00:09:16,812 --> 00:09:19,312
But if you still feel
this way in two weeks,

219
00:09:19,348 --> 00:09:20,547
there's nothing I can do about it.

220
00:09:20,582 --> 00:09:22,653
Two weeks? What the hell
are you talking about?

221
00:09:22,753 --> 00:09:24,697
You haven't heard.
Harvey's on vacation.

222
00:09:24,797 --> 00:09:26,330
Bullshit Harvey's on vacation.

223
00:09:26,365 --> 00:09:27,598
Harvey doesn't take vacations.

224
00:09:27,633 --> 00:09:29,583
Louis, you wanted him gone, and he's gone.

225
00:09:29,635 --> 00:09:32,970
And I have his signed
requisition right here.

226
00:09:32,972 --> 00:09:34,305
I don't just want him gone.

227
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:36,590
I want him humiliated
in front of the whole firm,

228
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:38,392
not lying on a beach in Turks and Caicos

229
00:09:38,444 --> 00:09:41,203
laughing at some fraudulent
requisition you concocted.

230
00:09:41,303 --> 00:09:43,470
Oh, that's a nasty allegation, Louis.

231
00:09:43,472 --> 00:09:44,788
Do you have proof?

232
00:09:44,823 --> 00:09:46,539
You know what, Jessica,
this is no different than me

233
00:09:46,575 --> 00:09:48,258
putting Harvey's salary
in the copy machine.

234
00:09:48,293 --> 00:09:49,909
Oh, it's entirely different, Louis.

235
00:09:49,945 --> 00:09:52,028
You did that to rip us apart,

236
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,280
and I'm doing this to keep us together.

237
00:09:54,316 --> 00:09:55,899
So why don't you walk
the hell out my office

238
00:09:55,951 --> 00:09:58,935
and think very carefully
about how you want to play this?

239
00:10:04,917 --> 00:10:07,384
All right, before they get here,
let's get our facts straight.

240
00:10:07,419 --> 00:10:09,536
Easy, our client's being
acquired by Google,

241
00:10:09,571 --> 00:10:11,388
but Optela Software has a buy option.

242
00:10:11,423 --> 00:10:12,806
Claims to have a buy option.

243
00:10:12,841 --> 00:10:14,725
It actually expired six months ago.

244
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,460
They why are we having this meeting?

245
00:10:16,462 --> 00:10:18,862
Because their lawyers
don't know we know that,

246
00:10:18,897 --> 00:10:21,001
and they're hoping to get
something to go away.

247
00:10:21,101 --> 00:10:23,885
Man, I have so much to teach you.

248
00:10:23,887 --> 00:10:25,871
What, are you my boss now?

249
00:10:25,906 --> 00:10:27,506
Oh, how is that different than before?

250
00:10:27,558 --> 00:10:30,592
I could leave you high and dry right now.

251
00:10:30,594 --> 00:10:34,379
You know that, right?

252
00:10:34,431 --> 00:10:35,514
Shit.

253
00:10:35,549 --> 00:10:36,932
Mike, it was a joke.

254
00:10:36,967 --> 00:10:38,233
Rachel, I need you to handle
this meeting by yourself.

255
00:10:38,285 --> 00:10:40,769
- What? What's wrong?
- Their lawyer just got here.

256
00:10:40,804 --> 00:10:41,804
Her?

257
00:10:41,805 --> 00:10:42,737
She used to work at a nonprofit

258
00:10:42,739 --> 00:10:43,852
when I was a bike messenger, all right?

259
00:10:43,952 --> 00:10:44,952
We went out a few times.

260
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:46,250
Mike, please.
I can handle that...

261
00:10:46,271 --> 00:10:48,872
No, no, no, she knows I
didn't go to law school.

262
00:10:48,924 --> 00:10:50,423
- What?
- If she sees me,

263
00:10:50,475 --> 00:10:51,691
she's gonna know I'm not
a lawyer, all right?

264
00:10:51,693 --> 00:10:52,859
I need you to handle this meeting.

265
00:10:52,911 --> 00:10:54,360
- Can you do that?
- No, no, no... Mike, please.

266
00:10:54,412 --> 00:10:55,562
You have to give me a second
to process what you're saying.

267
00:10:55,597 --> 00:10:56,513
Rachel, I don't have a second.

268
00:10:56,548 --> 00:10:59,399
- I need you to do this.
- Okay.

269
00:10:59,401 --> 00:11:01,317
Okay.

270
00:11:06,553 --> 00:11:07,719
Hi.

271
00:11:07,771 --> 00:11:09,737
- Hi.
- Claire Bowden.

272
00:11:09,739 --> 00:11:11,806
Rachel Zane.

273
00:11:11,842 --> 00:11:12,907
Shall we get to it?

274
00:11:12,943 --> 00:11:13,975
Yes, definitely.

275
00:11:14,027 --> 00:11:16,211
Let's... let's get to it.

276
00:11:16,246 --> 00:11:17,629
First of all, I need to inform you

277
00:11:17,664 --> 00:11:19,848
that we are prepared to
move forward with a TRO,

278
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:21,737
unless, of course, your client
has had a change of heart.

279
00:11:21,837 --> 00:11:23,070
You can do that.

280
00:11:23,105 --> 00:11:26,256
I just don't see any
judge granting you a TRO

281
00:11:26,292 --> 00:11:28,142
given that your option has expired.

282
00:11:28,194 --> 00:11:30,194
Actually, it hasn't.

283
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:38,519
This is a record of a phone call

284
00:11:38,555 --> 00:11:40,254
between our client and yours.

285
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:41,505
A phone call during which

286
00:11:41,558 --> 00:11:43,891
our client agreed to fix bugs
in your client's software

287
00:11:43,943 --> 00:11:45,383
in exchange
for a five-year extension

288
00:11:45,395 --> 00:11:46,961
of our purchase option.

289
00:11:46,963 --> 00:11:48,946
I'm confused.
Do...

290
00:11:48,982 --> 00:11:51,877
Do you actually want to buy
our client's company?

291
00:11:51,977 --> 00:11:53,643
Yes, if there's a deal happening,

292
00:11:53,678 --> 00:11:56,562
we want to be included in a meaningful way.

293
00:11:59,216 --> 00:12:00,432
I'm sorry.

294
00:12:00,923 --> 00:12:03,523
I'm not authorized to
include you in any deal.

295
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:06,126
Then pick up the phone
and call your client.

296
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,479
I understand.

297
00:12:09,515 --> 00:12:11,298
You're not authorized to do
that either because a partner

298
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:13,258
dropped this in your lap in the 11th hour.

299
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:15,358
You have no idea.

300
00:12:15,393 --> 00:12:16,826
No, I've been there before.

301
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:18,501
But I need something to take to my client.

302
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:20,430
So, get back to me as soon as you can?

303
00:12:20,465 --> 00:12:22,248
Yes, absolutely.

304
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:24,701
Great.

305
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:26,335
By the way,

306
00:12:26,371 --> 00:12:29,238
how old is the partner on this case?

307
00:12:29,274 --> 00:12:30,440
Why would you ask that?

308
00:12:30,475 --> 00:12:32,608
Because I noticed that
his name was Michael Ross,

309
00:12:32,644 --> 00:12:34,477
and I went out with a Mike Ross once.

310
00:12:34,479 --> 00:12:36,199
I was just wondering if
it was the same guy.

311
00:12:36,214 --> 00:12:40,149
Because if it is, he really
turned his life around.

312
00:12:40,151 --> 00:12:44,220
I...I'm not sure how old he is.

313
00:12:44,255 --> 00:12:46,222
This is the first time
we've had a case together.

314
00:12:46,224 --> 00:12:49,559
So I... maybe he's about 45?

315
00:12:49,611 --> 00:12:52,061
- Oh, definitely not him.
- Sorry.

316
00:12:52,113 --> 00:12:53,112
Oh, you don't have to be sorry.

317
00:12:53,148 --> 00:12:54,731
I was just wondering.

318
00:12:54,733 --> 00:12:56,866
- Thank you.
- Yes, of course.

319
00:13:11,571 --> 00:13:12,671
How'd it go?

320
00:13:12,706 --> 00:13:14,239
- Not well.
- What happened?

321
00:13:14,241 --> 00:13:17,075
What happened was their
buy option didn't expire

322
00:13:17,111 --> 00:13:19,995
because it turns out
we made a deal to extend it.

323
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:22,581
Okay, yeah, that complicates things.

324
00:13:22,616 --> 00:13:24,783
They're gonna want to squeeze us
for more money to go away,

325
00:13:24,818 --> 00:13:28,720
but it's not that big a deal.

326
00:13:29,318 --> 00:13:31,418
It's not that big a deal?

327
00:13:33,388 --> 00:13:35,221
It's not that big a deal?

328
00:13:35,257 --> 00:13:37,057
You practically ran from
that conference room

329
00:13:37,092 --> 00:13:39,059
to come and hide in here
and left me to deal with a woman

330
00:13:39,094 --> 00:13:40,460
who knows your secret,

331
00:13:40,495 --> 00:13:42,132
and you're gonna tell me
that it's not that big a deal.

332
00:13:42,232 --> 00:13:44,766
I meant having to pay off
Optela is not that big a deal.

333
00:13:44,802 --> 00:13:46,468
You didn't even tell me
how she knows your secret.

334
00:13:46,503 --> 00:13:48,153
She doesn't know my secret, all right?

335
00:13:48,188 --> 00:13:49,321
I told her I went to law school,

336
00:13:49,373 --> 00:13:51,106
and she found out I didn't.

337
00:13:51,337 --> 00:13:52,553
If she sees me now,

338
00:13:52,605 --> 00:13:54,272
she's gonna look into me
and then she'll know it.

339
00:13:54,307 --> 00:13:55,373
And why did you tell her

340
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:56,841
that you went to law
school in the first place?

341
00:13:56,969 --> 00:13:58,652
- Rachel, it's not important.
- It's important to me.

342
00:13:58,687 --> 00:13:59,967
Because I wanted to impress her,

343
00:13:59,972 --> 00:14:03,040
and being a bike messenger
wasn't gonna do it.

344
00:14:03,442 --> 00:14:05,209
So you lied to her to get a date?

345
00:14:05,244 --> 00:14:06,977
Yes, I did.

346
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:10,414
Well, you're not the only person
who's lied to her now.

347
00:14:10,449 --> 00:14:11,449
What does that mean?

348
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:13,784
What it means is, she asked me about you,

349
00:14:13,819 --> 00:14:17,020
and I had to lie to keep her from thinking

350
00:14:17,056 --> 00:14:19,723
that you're the same Mike Ross
that she knew before.

351
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:22,126
Rachel, I'm sorry.
I...

352
00:14:22,161 --> 00:14:25,045
- Where are you going?
- To work on your case.

353
00:14:30,516 --> 00:14:32,616
As for the aforementioned case,

354
00:14:32,618 --> 00:14:34,251
send our client his practice depo,

355
00:14:34,286 --> 00:14:36,653
and underline
all self-incriminating things

356
00:14:36,689 --> 00:14:38,689
that he's not supposed to say under oath.

357
00:14:38,691 --> 00:14:39,990
Idiot.

358
00:14:40,042 --> 00:14:41,625
Moving on to...

359
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:42,759
Donna, call security.

360
00:14:42,795 --> 00:14:44,895
I do not feel safe in my own office.

361
00:14:44,897 --> 00:14:46,396
Donna went home.

362
00:14:46,432 --> 00:14:47,414
I'm here to speak to you alone.

363
00:14:47,449 --> 00:14:48,765
Why? So you can have
no witnesses

364
00:14:48,801 --> 00:14:49,833
the next time you attack me?

365
00:14:49,869 --> 00:14:52,069
No, so I could apologize to you in private.

366
00:14:52,104 --> 00:14:53,387
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

367
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:54,571
You're not gonna apologize
your way out of this one.

368
00:14:54,607 --> 00:14:56,547
I'm not here to get out of anything.

369
00:14:56,647 --> 00:14:58,046
I'm here to say I'm sorry.

370
00:14:58,081 --> 00:14:59,781
I flew off the handle, and
I shouldn't have punched you.

371
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:01,249
You didn't just punch me.
You attacked me.

372
00:15:01,285 --> 00:15:02,217
- Louis...
- Bullshit.

373
00:15:02,219 --> 00:15:03,219
This is all bullshit.

374
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:05,120
There is something wrong with you,

375
00:15:05,155 --> 00:15:07,722
and there is nothing that you
could ever possibly say to me...

376
00:15:07,758 --> 00:15:10,091
I have been seeing a psychiatrist.

377
00:15:10,339 --> 00:15:11,772
What?
No, you haven't.

378
00:15:11,807 --> 00:15:13,173
This is some kind of trick.

379
00:15:13,208 --> 00:15:17,144
I've been seeing someone
to get help for panic attacks.

380
00:15:17,179 --> 00:15:19,813
You've been having panic attacks?

381
00:15:19,848 --> 00:15:21,915
- Yes.
- Where?

382
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:22,866
Look, I don't want to get into it.

383
00:15:22,918 --> 00:15:23,918
Where?

384
00:15:26,698 --> 00:15:28,431
In the office.

385
00:15:28,466 --> 00:15:30,566
When?

386
00:15:30,602 --> 00:15:32,635
They happen when they happen.

387
00:15:32,671 --> 00:15:33,903
Louis,

388
00:15:33,938 --> 00:15:36,506
I am telling you the truth.

389
00:15:39,868 --> 00:15:41,168
My God.
How long have they...

390
00:15:41,203 --> 00:15:43,436
They started a few months ago.

391
00:15:43,472 --> 00:15:45,355
A few... when Donna left?

392
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:46,940
Yes, when Donna left.

393
00:15:46,975 --> 00:15:50,243
But it isn't really about Donna.

394
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:53,613
That was a trigger... at least
that's what they're telling me.

395
00:15:53,649 --> 00:15:55,382
It goes deeper.

396
00:15:55,417 --> 00:15:56,417
My family,

397
00:15:56,418 --> 00:15:59,336
my relationships.

398
00:16:02,932 --> 00:16:05,900
Let's just say I'm trying
to work through some shit.

399
00:16:05,935 --> 00:16:08,502
So when I said those
things, it struck a nerve.

400
00:16:08,538 --> 00:16:10,688
Oh, it did more than that, Louis.

401
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:11,740
It hurt.

402
00:16:11,741 --> 00:16:13,040
You hurt me too, Harvey.

403
00:16:13,076 --> 00:16:14,609
I know, and I'm sorry.

404
00:16:14,611 --> 00:16:15,743
And it's not an excuse,

405
00:16:15,778 --> 00:16:17,712
but I wanted you to know
why I did what I did

406
00:16:17,747 --> 00:16:22,450
and where it was coming from.

407
00:16:22,485 --> 00:16:24,118
You're not really going
to Turks and Caicos, are you?

408
00:16:24,153 --> 00:16:26,120
I don't know, but I had
therapy this afternoon,

409
00:16:26,155 --> 00:16:27,355
and I spent the rest of the day

410
00:16:27,357 --> 00:16:32,760
trying to figure out the
best way to do this.

411
00:16:32,795 --> 00:16:37,298
Louis, I'm sorry for Esther.

412
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:39,834
I'm sorry for lying to you.

413
00:16:39,869 --> 00:16:45,139
And I'm sorry that I attacked you.

414
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,634
I accept your apology, Harvey.

415
00:16:48,643 --> 00:16:50,410
Thank you, Louis.

416
00:16:57,268 --> 00:17:00,353
So you're not gonna try and suspend me?

417
00:17:00,388 --> 00:17:01,854
Suspend you?

418
00:17:02,249 --> 00:17:04,549
Jessica was sure you'd want to suspend me.

419
00:17:04,601 --> 00:17:08,286
Jessica didn't know that you
were gonna say what you said.

420
00:17:08,321 --> 00:17:09,420
As a matter of fact, I know Jessica

421
00:17:09,473 --> 00:17:11,956
only sent you on vacation
to defuse the situation,

422
00:17:11,992 --> 00:17:14,225
so I think you should come back tomorrow.

423
00:17:14,261 --> 00:17:16,027
- You sure?
- Yes.

424
00:17:16,062 --> 00:17:17,228
They're announcing Mike's partnership,

425
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,265
and I wouldn't want you to miss that.

426
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:23,201
- I appreciate that, Louis.
- It's the least I can do.

427
00:17:39,848 --> 00:17:41,414
Can I talk to you for a second?

428
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:43,016
If it's about you becoming senior partner,

429
00:17:43,051 --> 00:17:44,985
I think it's a little premature.

430
00:17:48,624 --> 00:17:49,689
We may have a problem.

431
00:17:49,725 --> 00:17:51,057
May or do?

432
00:17:51,345 --> 00:17:53,045
The lawyer on the other side
of the Metadesk case

433
00:17:53,097 --> 00:17:54,330
knows that I didn't go to law school.

434
00:17:54,365 --> 00:17:55,297
What?

435
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:56,493
I saw her come into the office

436
00:17:56,517 --> 00:17:58,317
before the meeting, so I
had Rachel take over,

437
00:17:58,319 --> 00:18:00,102
and she's doesn't know
I'm the same Mike Ross she knew,

438
00:18:00,138 --> 00:18:01,537
and she's not going to, but...

439
00:18:01,572 --> 00:18:02,605
Goddamn first case.

440
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,790
Jessica, it's gonna be handled.
I promise.

441
00:18:04,842 --> 00:18:06,322
Now, Rachel and I will work together,

442
00:18:06,344 --> 00:18:07,777
but she'll be out front the whole time.

443
00:18:07,779 --> 00:18:08,778
Well, I guess we have no choice

444
00:18:08,813 --> 00:18:10,379
but to let her ride it out.

445
00:18:10,985 --> 00:18:12,451
But it's gonna look pretty damn sketchy

446
00:18:12,486 --> 00:18:14,786
if someone finds out you've
handed off your first case.

447
00:18:14,838 --> 00:18:18,290
Which brings me to my next point.

448
00:18:18,325 --> 00:18:19,992
Jack Soloff has been asking about it.

449
00:18:20,044 --> 00:18:21,393
Then you better make damn sure

450
00:18:21,428 --> 00:18:23,996
you keep him from finding out
you put Rachel in charge.

451
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:26,974
Because the last thing we need
is for Jack Soloff

452
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:28,370
to start sniffing around your past.

453
00:18:28,378 --> 00:18:29,378
Yeah, I know.

454
00:18:29,412 --> 00:18:30,511
Well, if you know all these things,

455
00:18:30,546 --> 00:18:31,979
then why exactly are you here?

456
00:18:32,014 --> 00:18:33,514
Because you trusted me with being partner

457
00:18:33,549 --> 00:18:34,782
and I'm trying to repay that trust

458
00:18:34,817 --> 00:18:36,817
by keeping you in the loop.

459
00:18:36,852 --> 00:18:39,303
I appreciate that, Mike.

460
00:18:39,355 --> 00:18:41,288
But the best way for you to repay me

461
00:18:41,324 --> 00:18:42,890
is by making sure that other lawyer

462
00:18:42,925 --> 00:18:45,826
doesn't find out your goddamn
secret in the first place.

463
00:18:57,591 --> 00:18:59,657
- Get one of those for me?
- No, I didn't.

464
00:18:59,693 --> 00:19:01,326
And you can't take mine
like you usually do.

465
00:19:01,361 --> 00:19:03,595
Easy, tiger, I'm not
here to take your bagel.

466
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:06,731
I'm here to give you this.

467
00:19:06,766 --> 00:19:08,046
How'd you get that done so fast?

468
00:19:08,068 --> 00:19:09,167
I know a guy.

469
00:19:09,202 --> 00:19:10,960
You know a guy in custom engraving?

470
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:12,609
I know a guy in everything.

471
00:19:12,661 --> 00:19:14,545
Oh, thanks, Harvey,
but you didn't have to do that.

472
00:19:14,597 --> 00:19:16,563
Come on, it's not every
day you make partner,

473
00:19:16,615 --> 00:19:20,250
and I've never known anyone
who deserves it as much as you.

474
00:19:20,302 --> 00:19:21,302
Except for you.

475
00:19:21,303 --> 00:19:22,236
Well, that goes without saying.

476
00:19:22,271 --> 00:19:23,271
So why'd you say it?

477
00:19:23,272 --> 00:19:24,872
- Because it had to be said.
- Ah.

478
00:19:25,488 --> 00:19:27,621
Seriously, Mike,

479
00:19:27,657 --> 00:19:30,257
you deserve this.
I'm glad you got it.

480
00:19:30,293 --> 00:19:32,059
I just wish I could have been
the one that made it happen.

481
00:19:32,095 --> 00:19:33,594
I'm just glad you made
it in for the meeting

482
00:19:33,629 --> 00:19:35,663
after everything that happened
between you and Louis.

483
00:19:35,698 --> 00:19:37,465
Believe it or not, it
was Louis who actually

484
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,780
invited me to come back to work.

485
00:19:38,801 --> 00:19:40,668
How'd you manage to get him to do that?

486
00:19:40,703 --> 00:19:42,670
Well, you wouldn't believe
me if I told you.

487
00:19:42,705 --> 00:19:45,673
But even if he hadn't invited me back,

488
00:19:45,708 --> 00:19:47,975
an army couldn't have kept me
away from your partnership vote.

489
00:19:48,011 --> 00:19:49,477
Come on, Harvey, it's just a formality.

490
00:19:49,512 --> 00:19:51,062
They've already given me the title.

491
00:19:51,097 --> 00:19:52,680
It may be just a formality,

492
00:19:52,732 --> 00:19:56,350
but that meeting's not happening
without my vote on the record.

493
00:20:05,126 --> 00:20:07,626
The next item up for bid
on<i> The Price is Right</i>

494
00:20:07,628 --> 00:20:10,028
is Mike Ross's nomination
for junior partner.

495
00:20:10,212 --> 00:20:12,262
Now, I know it's just a formality,

496
00:20:12,315 --> 00:20:14,148
but what do you say we make it unanimous?

497
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:16,300
All those in favor?

498
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:20,054
Then I'm pleased to announce Mike Ross

499
00:20:20,089 --> 00:20:22,256
as this firm's newest junior partner.

500
00:20:22,258 --> 00:20:24,425
So, if no one else has anything...

501
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:25,926
I have something.

502
00:20:28,863 --> 00:20:30,496
If you're all wondering why

503
00:20:30,532 --> 00:20:32,832
I have extensive damage to my skull,

504
00:20:32,867 --> 00:20:34,767
it's because two nights ago,

505
00:20:34,802 --> 00:20:37,703
I was viciously attacked by Harvey Specter.

506
00:20:37,738 --> 00:20:39,972
And since I would rather
not go outside the firm

507
00:20:40,007 --> 00:20:43,643
to take legal action, pursuant
to section 28-B of the bylaws,

508
00:20:43,778 --> 00:20:48,414
I am placing Harvey Specter
on immediate unpaid suspension.

509
00:20:48,949 --> 00:20:50,082
You son of a bitch.

510
00:20:50,117 --> 00:20:51,749
Okay, I don't really know how this works.

511
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:52,918
Should someone call security?

512
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:54,419
Louis, I don't think
anyone needs to call...

513
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:57,476
- It's my right.
- Actually, Louis, it's not.

514
00:20:57,477 --> 00:21:00,880
Section 28-B does require
suspension, however,

515
00:21:00,881 --> 00:21:02,448
it's enforceable only

516
00:21:02,449 --> 00:21:05,084
after a vote by the partners to determine

517
00:21:05,085 --> 00:21:06,652
if what you're claiming even happened.

518
00:21:06,653 --> 00:21:07,653
Oh, it happened.

519
00:21:07,689 --> 00:21:09,260
I'm not saying it didn't.

520
00:21:09,289 --> 00:21:11,055
I'm just quoting the bylaws you wrote.

521
00:21:11,090 --> 00:21:13,391
Therefore, I'd like
to schedule a vote for Friday,

522
00:21:13,426 --> 00:21:15,393
once we've all had a chance
to review the matter.

523
00:21:15,428 --> 00:21:16,560
Okay, this is not what I want...

524
00:21:16,613 --> 00:21:18,663
They're your bylaws, Louis...

525
00:21:18,665 --> 00:21:20,731
so Friday it is.

526
00:21:20,767 --> 00:21:22,833
Meeting adjourned.

527
00:21:34,236 --> 00:21:35,669
Rachel.

528
00:21:35,705 --> 00:21:37,204
- Good to see you.
- You too.

529
00:21:37,239 --> 00:21:38,172
I have to admit, I'm surprised

530
00:21:38,174 --> 00:21:39,373
you're getting back to us so soon.

531
00:21:39,408 --> 00:21:41,308
Well, once we realized
what you really wanted,

532
00:21:41,344 --> 00:21:42,609
we figured why wait?

533
00:21:42,645 --> 00:21:43,844
And what is it that we really want?

534
00:21:43,896 --> 00:21:45,245
Let's be honest.

535
00:21:45,281 --> 00:21:47,481
Your client has no real interest

536
00:21:47,516 --> 00:21:49,529
in the fulfillment software business.

537
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:50,810
No, that's not actually true...

538
00:21:50,811 --> 00:21:52,745
But you do have an extension
of your purchase option,

539
00:21:52,747 --> 00:21:54,229
which may or may not hold up in court.

540
00:21:54,265 --> 00:21:57,850
So we're willing to pay
you this to go away.

541
00:22:00,054 --> 00:22:02,680
I think maybe you misunderstood
me in our last meeting.

542
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:04,012
I'm not some corporate killer

543
00:22:04,048 --> 00:22:05,530
who's looking to hold you
hostage for a payoff.

544
00:22:05,582 --> 00:22:07,582
My client actually wants to be
included in this deal.

545
00:22:07,618 --> 00:22:10,318
Claire, this is an incredibly fair offer.

546
00:22:10,354 --> 00:22:11,937
I don't think this is a fair offer at all.

547
00:22:11,972 --> 00:22:13,455
Well, then let's talk about what would be,

548
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:15,724
because your client's not
staying involved in this deal.

549
00:22:18,413 --> 00:22:22,182
Is this your boss's stance or yours?

550
00:22:22,217 --> 00:22:25,135
It's our client's, and my firm's,

551
00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:26,690
and I don't appreciate you questioning

552
00:22:26,738 --> 00:22:27,954
my role in this deal.

553
00:22:27,989 --> 00:22:30,256
Look, Rachel, I cut you
some slack yesterday

554
00:22:30,292 --> 00:22:32,058
because you're a newbie
who's in over her head,

555
00:22:32,093 --> 00:22:33,543
but since you clearly don't have the power

556
00:22:33,595 --> 00:22:34,861
to include us in this deal,

557
00:22:34,896 --> 00:22:37,030
I think maybe I should call
the partner on this case.

558
00:22:37,699 --> 00:22:38,865
You know what?
You should.

559
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,066
But he's just gonna say this:

560
00:22:40,102 --> 00:22:42,001
If you pursue a TRO, we'll sue you

561
00:22:42,037 --> 00:22:43,077
for tortious interference.

562
00:22:43,105 --> 00:22:44,105
Excuse me?

563
00:22:44,106 --> 00:22:44,988
You knew this sale was in process,

564
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,072
and you waited till closing

565
00:22:46,108 --> 00:22:47,407
to broach the topic.

566
00:22:47,442 --> 00:22:50,376
- That is tortious interference.
- Okay.

567
00:22:50,412 --> 00:22:51,511
Well, I think we're done here.

568
00:22:51,546 --> 00:22:53,313
Just take the money and walk away,

569
00:22:53,348 --> 00:22:55,849
or we will tie this up in court for years.

570
00:22:55,884 --> 00:22:57,801
It's up to you.
But then again, what do I know?

571
00:22:57,836 --> 00:22:59,452
I'm just a newbie.

572
00:23:04,634 --> 00:23:07,451
You lying piece of shit.

573
00:23:07,486 --> 00:23:10,971
I lied because I'm not
the fool you think I am.

574
00:23:10,973 --> 00:23:12,189
What the hell are you talking about?

575
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:14,174
I'm talking about your
apology from the heart.

576
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:16,143
You actually had me
falling for that bullshit

577
00:23:16,178 --> 00:23:18,018
until you asked me if I
was gonna suspend you.

578
00:23:18,064 --> 00:23:20,929
And then I knew it was just
all a goddamn manipulation.

579
00:23:21,029 --> 00:23:23,663
You think me opening up
about having panic attacks

580
00:23:23,699 --> 00:23:24,998
is manipulation?

581
00:23:25,033 --> 00:23:26,433
I don't even think you
really had panic attacks,

582
00:23:26,468 --> 00:23:27,834
let alone are going to therapy.

583
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:29,970
Well, I am, and I opened
up to you about it,

584
00:23:30,005 --> 00:23:31,371
and then you looked me in the eye,

585
00:23:31,407 --> 00:23:33,607
and you used Mike's
partnership to lure me back.

586
00:23:33,609 --> 00:23:35,275
Yes.

587
00:23:35,277 --> 00:23:36,593
I did.

588
00:23:36,628 --> 00:23:39,563
Because I wanted you to know
how it feels when someone

589
00:23:39,615 --> 00:23:42,883
says one thing to your face
and then turns right around

590
00:23:42,935 --> 00:23:45,398
and does the exact opposite,
like you did to me.

591
00:23:45,498 --> 00:23:47,382
So this is payback for me
sleeping with your sister?

592
00:23:47,384 --> 00:23:48,966
- Sure as shit is.
- You son of a bitch.

593
00:23:49,019 --> 00:23:49,984
I should take you outside right now...

594
00:23:49,986 --> 00:23:51,452
And do what?
Hit me again?

595
00:23:51,488 --> 00:23:53,488
Because this time it won't
just be a suspension, Harvey.

596
00:23:53,523 --> 00:23:55,234
- You'll be gone.
- That's enough.

597
00:23:55,651 --> 00:23:56,750
No one's hitting anybody.

598
00:23:58,621 --> 00:24:01,495
Harvey, you are not to be alone in a room

599
00:24:01,519 --> 00:24:03,450
with this man, before that vote.

600
00:24:03,451 --> 00:24:06,719
Is that clear?

601
00:24:06,754 --> 00:24:10,173
This isn't over.

602
00:24:10,208 --> 00:24:11,441
Thank you, Jessica.

603
00:24:11,443 --> 00:24:13,576
A law firm should be a safe environment,

604
00:24:13,578 --> 00:24:15,178
and I started to feel like I was fearful...

605
00:24:15,213 --> 00:24:16,279
Shut the hell up, Louis.

606
00:24:16,331 --> 00:24:19,649
What you did in there was despicable.

607
00:24:19,684 --> 00:24:22,819
It was underhanded and vindictive

608
00:24:22,854 --> 00:24:25,788
and harmful to the entire firm.

609
00:24:26,402 --> 00:24:28,035
I take it you won't be voting
to discipline Harvey.

610
00:24:28,071 --> 00:24:29,470
I won't be voting at all.

611
00:24:29,505 --> 00:24:31,188
And if you think you're gonna
drag me into your bullshit,

612
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,339
then you have another thing coming.

613
00:24:32,375 --> 00:24:34,208
Oh, you can abstain all you want,

614
00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:36,577
but everyone's gonna
know exactly where you stand.

615
00:24:36,612 --> 00:24:39,764
They already know where I stand.

616
00:24:39,816 --> 00:24:41,699
And it's not with you.

617
00:24:50,052 --> 00:24:53,053
You slapped her with a lawsuit?

618
00:24:53,105 --> 00:24:54,304
Did she call you?

619
00:24:54,356 --> 00:24:55,823
No, she called Google,
and then they called me

620
00:24:55,875 --> 00:24:57,257
to tell me they're pulling out of the deal.

621
00:24:57,293 --> 00:24:58,358
- What?
- Yeah, they don't want

622
00:24:58,394 --> 00:24:59,359
to run the risk this thing gets tied up

623
00:24:59,395 --> 00:25:00,661
in litigation, so they're out.

624
00:25:00,663 --> 00:25:02,162
- Mike, I can explain.
- No, you don't have to explain.

625
00:25:02,198 --> 00:25:03,330
You explained the last time we talked.

626
00:25:03,365 --> 00:25:04,365
Excuse me?

627
00:25:04,416 --> 00:25:05,465
You've got a problem with Claire,

628
00:25:05,501 --> 00:25:07,150
and you're taking it out on this case.

629
00:25:07,186 --> 00:25:10,170
I don't have a problem with Claire.

630
00:25:10,815 --> 00:25:12,581
I have a problem with you lying to her

631
00:25:12,583 --> 00:25:13,916
about going to law school.

632
00:25:13,918 --> 00:25:15,217
But the reason I threatened that suit

633
00:25:15,269 --> 00:25:17,319
is because she didn't like not
getting her way with me,

634
00:25:17,354 --> 00:25:18,987
and she was going to call you instead.

635
00:25:19,023 --> 00:25:20,189
Well, you stopped that from happening,

636
00:25:20,241 --> 00:25:22,124
and in the process, you
blew up the entire deal.

637
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:25,194
Did you hear me?
She was going to call you.

638
00:25:25,229 --> 00:25:26,678
So I'm sorry that Google pulled out,

639
00:25:26,714 --> 00:25:28,163
but I didn't really have the chance

640
00:25:28,199 --> 00:25:29,896
to think of every option...

641
00:25:29,996 --> 00:25:31,529
Every option?
There's only one.

642
00:25:31,564 --> 00:25:32,930
You negotiate another price.

643
00:25:32,966 --> 00:25:34,031
You think I didn't try that?

644
00:25:34,067 --> 00:25:35,587
The only thing she would have accepted

645
00:25:35,601 --> 00:25:37,041
is being cut in on the deal, period.

646
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:38,510
All I know is that if I'd been there,

647
00:25:38,521 --> 00:25:39,937
I would have figured out
a way to get it done.

648
00:25:39,973 --> 00:25:42,073
Well, you know what?
You couldn't have been there.

649
00:25:42,108 --> 00:25:43,441
And I don't appreciate you telling me

650
00:25:43,476 --> 00:25:45,710
that I'm not as good as
you when the only reason

651
00:25:45,745 --> 00:25:47,511
I was in that meeting in the first place

652
00:25:47,563 --> 00:25:50,247
was to cover for you.

653
00:25:53,332 --> 00:25:55,282
Rachel, I'm sorry, I didn't
mean to make it personal.

654
00:25:55,284 --> 00:25:57,584
Well, it sure sounded personal
when you accused me

655
00:25:57,636 --> 00:25:59,818
of screwing up because I was jealous.

656
00:25:59,918 --> 00:26:01,151
Look, I just said that I'm sorry.

657
00:26:01,186 --> 00:26:02,746
I'm only coming down on you the same way

658
00:26:02,754 --> 00:26:04,554
Harvey would come down on me
in the same situation.

659
00:26:04,589 --> 00:26:06,222
Right, but you're not
Harvey, and I'm not you.

660
00:26:06,224 --> 00:26:07,290
And if Harvey was talking to you

661
00:26:07,325 --> 00:26:08,708
the way that you're talking to me,

662
00:26:08,744 --> 00:26:12,579
you would be in here right now
telling me what a dick he is.

663
00:26:24,438 --> 00:26:25,354
Can I have that, please?

664
00:26:25,406 --> 00:26:27,206
What?

665
00:26:27,241 --> 00:26:29,141
I haven't done your
transcriptions since yesterday,

666
00:26:29,176 --> 00:26:30,225
so...

667
00:26:30,277 --> 00:26:34,246
Oh, it can wait.
Go home.

668
00:26:34,248 --> 00:26:35,981
What?

669
00:26:36,016 --> 00:26:38,767
You went too far today, Louis.

670
00:26:38,819 --> 00:26:41,420
So, you're not really here to do work.

671
00:26:41,872 --> 00:26:43,805
You're here to once again
take Harvey's side.

672
00:26:43,841 --> 00:26:45,040
I'm not taking Harvey's side,

673
00:26:45,041 --> 00:26:46,591
but what you did in that meeting was wrong.

674
00:26:46,626 --> 00:26:48,376
You told me to keep it in the
family, and that's what I did.

675
00:26:48,378 --> 00:26:50,628
I meant let Jessica handle
it, and you know it.

676
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,680
But Jessica didn't handle it.

677
00:26:52,715 --> 00:26:54,715
She tried to send Harvey to the Caribbean.

678
00:26:54,767 --> 00:26:56,884
Oh, so the only thing that
you could do was blindside him

679
00:26:56,936 --> 00:26:59,220
in the same meeting where
Mike is made junior partner?

680
00:26:59,272 --> 00:27:00,688
He assaulted me.

681
00:27:00,723 --> 00:27:02,306
I understand that, Louis.

682
00:27:02,358 --> 00:27:03,724
But what I don't understand

683
00:27:03,776 --> 00:27:05,476
is why you're the one who
went in there angry,

684
00:27:05,528 --> 00:27:07,111
and he's the one who
ended up attacking you.

685
00:27:07,146 --> 00:27:08,396
- Donna...
- What did you say to him?

686
00:27:08,448 --> 00:27:10,231
I don't have to explain myself to you.

687
00:27:10,233 --> 00:27:12,033
No, you don't, and you're free
to do whatever you want.

688
00:27:12,068 --> 00:27:13,568
But when I saw your face after he hit you,

689
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:16,654
I felt horrible for you.

690
00:27:16,706 --> 00:27:18,873
But since you won't tell me
what you said to him,

691
00:27:18,908 --> 00:27:21,909
I'm starting to wonder if I should.

692
00:27:35,038 --> 00:27:38,373
What's this?

693
00:27:38,409 --> 00:27:40,075
I know you had to
reschedule the cake tasting

694
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:42,661
because of the case, so

695
00:27:42,696 --> 00:27:45,380
I thought I'd bring the
cake tasting to you.

696
00:27:45,416 --> 00:27:46,982
You didn't have to do that.

697
00:27:47,017 --> 00:27:49,217
I wanted to, because I wanted to make sure

698
00:27:49,253 --> 00:27:51,820
that you know that no matter
what's going on at work,

699
00:27:51,855 --> 00:27:53,575
you're the most important thing in my life.

700
00:27:53,591 --> 00:27:56,224
I know you were just trying
to keep me from getting caught.

701
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:59,027
And I'm sorry.

702
00:27:59,063 --> 00:28:00,964
I'm sorry, too.

703
00:28:01,064 --> 00:28:02,230
What for?

704
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:05,918
Because as much as I hate to admit it,

705
00:28:05,953 --> 00:28:07,728
I do have a problem with Claire.

706
00:28:07,828 --> 00:28:09,394
Rachel...

707
00:28:09,446 --> 00:28:12,864
Mike, I was sitting across
the table from her,

708
00:28:12,899 --> 00:28:16,067
and I could see all the reasons
why you were interested in her.

709
00:28:16,103 --> 00:28:19,938
And I... I had to wonder
what would have happened

710
00:28:19,973 --> 00:28:21,439
if she'd never found out that you lied,

711
00:28:21,475 --> 00:28:23,675
or if she found out a year later

712
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:26,378
after she'd gotten to know you better.

713
00:28:26,413 --> 00:28:28,496
Maybe the two of you
would still be together.

714
00:28:28,548 --> 00:28:29,948
- We wouldn't be.
- How do you know?

715
00:28:29,983 --> 00:28:32,017
Because it might have taken me
a while to tell you the truth,

716
00:28:32,052 --> 00:28:35,153
but from the first second I looked at you,

717
00:28:35,188 --> 00:28:38,290
I wanted to tell you everything about me.

718
00:28:38,325 --> 00:28:40,542
And when I finally did tell you the truth,

719
00:28:40,594 --> 00:28:44,829
you didn't tell me that you
never wanted to see me again.

720
00:28:48,048 --> 00:28:49,781
You accepted me.

721
00:28:49,816 --> 00:28:52,117
Actually, I slapped you.

722
00:28:52,152 --> 00:28:55,187
- And then you kissed me.
- Yeah.

723
00:28:55,222 --> 00:28:56,421
And stayed with me.

724
00:28:56,456 --> 00:28:58,523
Mm-hmm.

725
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:00,492
And loved me anyway.

726
00:29:06,029 --> 00:29:08,797
- Jack.
- What can I do for you, Harvey?

727
00:29:08,832 --> 00:29:11,066
I wanted to thank you
for standing up for me today.

728
00:29:11,101 --> 00:29:14,069
I told Jessica I'm ready
to be a team player.

729
00:29:14,121 --> 00:29:15,721
Maybe now the two of you will believe me.

730
00:29:15,739 --> 00:29:17,222
Well, I don't know
if I'm willing to go that far,

731
00:29:17,257 --> 00:29:18,873
but I appreciate what you did.

732
00:29:18,909 --> 00:29:20,141
Can I speak freely?

733
00:29:20,177 --> 00:29:21,459
Go ahead.

734
00:29:21,495 --> 00:29:23,294
You've earned it.

735
00:29:23,346 --> 00:29:24,446
I told Mike the reason

736
00:29:24,481 --> 00:29:25,947
that I went after you in the first place

737
00:29:25,982 --> 00:29:29,184
was that everything comes easy to you,

738
00:29:29,742 --> 00:29:31,675
but I'm not the only one
that feels that way.

739
00:29:31,711 --> 00:29:32,610
What's your point?

740
00:29:32,645 --> 00:29:33,645
I may have stopped Louis

741
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:35,079
from suspending you for the moment,

742
00:29:35,114 --> 00:29:36,814
but that vote's not gonna go well for you.

743
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:38,963
You're saying I can do
something to change the outcome.

744
00:29:38,999 --> 00:29:41,405
I'm saying you could do
something to change the way

745
00:29:41,505 --> 00:29:43,088
the partners feel about you.

746
00:29:43,123 --> 00:29:45,056
You want me to take this
suspension voluntarily?

747
00:29:45,092 --> 00:29:46,174
If this were a month ago,

748
00:29:46,209 --> 00:29:47,659
I'd want you to take
your name off the wall.

749
00:29:47,694 --> 00:29:49,614
But you need to do something
to humble yourself.

750
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:53,398
What exactly that is, is up to you.

751
00:30:08,949 --> 00:30:10,048
How did you get in here?

752
00:30:10,101 --> 00:30:11,483
The receptionist told me where to find you.

753
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:12,484
Well, she shouldn't have,

754
00:30:12,486 --> 00:30:13,569
so why don't you find your way out?

755
00:30:13,621 --> 00:30:16,088
Claire, I'm here to apologize.

756
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:19,825
Look, you got under my skin
when you called me inexperienced

757
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:23,629
because the truth is I haven't
been doing this very long.

758
00:30:24,084 --> 00:30:25,100
So I shot back,

759
00:30:25,135 --> 00:30:26,635
and I went overboard to try and...

760
00:30:26,687 --> 00:30:28,737
Show me that you were better than me.

761
00:30:28,789 --> 00:30:32,541
Yes, and I ended up
blowing the deal for both of us,

762
00:30:32,576 --> 00:30:33,959
and I'm sorry.

763
00:30:34,011 --> 00:30:37,517
Well, they say you learn
from your mistakes.

764
00:30:37,617 --> 00:30:38,565
That's the thing.

765
00:30:38,601 --> 00:30:40,050
I have already learned,

766
00:30:40,086 --> 00:30:45,789
and I think that I have a way
to get both of us a win.

767
00:30:45,825 --> 00:30:48,259
GigaDyne. They're a major
client at your firm.

768
00:30:48,294 --> 00:30:50,995
What if you were to bring them
the acquisition of Metadesk?

769
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:51,962
Why would they want this?

770
00:30:51,998 --> 00:30:53,197
Because they need fulfillment software

771
00:30:53,232 --> 00:30:55,132
to increase their sales in Europe,

772
00:30:55,167 --> 00:30:57,251
and we're a perfect fit.

773
00:30:57,286 --> 00:30:59,553
You researched my client?

774
00:30:59,605 --> 00:31:03,173
Like I said, I learn from my mistakes.

775
00:31:09,821 --> 00:31:11,921
- Hey.
- Oh, don't "hey" me.

776
00:31:11,957 --> 00:31:13,490
You're up to something.

777
00:31:13,525 --> 00:31:16,025
- Why would you say that?
- I worked for you for 12 years.

778
00:31:16,061 --> 00:31:18,461
You think I can't tell
when you're up to something?

779
00:31:18,463 --> 00:31:19,463
- Donna...
- Harvey,

780
00:31:19,464 --> 00:31:20,597
if you're coming to me in here,

781
00:31:20,649 --> 00:31:21,931
that means you don't want Louis to know.

782
00:31:21,967 --> 00:31:24,200
And I don't work for you
anymore... I work for him.

783
00:31:24,202 --> 00:31:27,335
I know that, and I know
what I'm about to ask

784
00:31:27,435 --> 00:31:29,202
might put you in between me and Louis.

785
00:31:29,237 --> 00:31:31,271
But I want you to help me
figure out something I can do

786
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:34,240
that'll move the partners
not to suspend me.

787
00:31:34,276 --> 00:31:37,110
Then tell me this.

788
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:39,179
What did Louis say to you
that made you hit him?

789
00:31:39,214 --> 00:31:40,547
Why are you asking me that?

790
00:31:40,582 --> 00:31:41,881
Because you're asking me to pick your side,

791
00:31:41,917 --> 00:31:44,567
and I need to know if you deserve it.

792
00:31:45,330 --> 00:31:47,097
Donna,

793
00:31:47,132 --> 00:31:48,782
if you don't know me well enough to know

794
00:31:48,817 --> 00:31:50,333
that I deserve your help by now,

795
00:31:50,369 --> 00:31:52,519
nothing I tell you is gonna matter.

796
00:31:52,554 --> 00:31:54,404
But whether I deserve it or not,

797
00:31:54,439 --> 00:31:56,673
I guarantee you Louis is going
to have some dirty trick

798
00:31:56,708 --> 00:31:58,508
up his sleeve for that vote.

799
00:32:08,537 --> 00:32:10,503
Louis, I need to talk to you for a second.

800
00:32:10,539 --> 00:32:12,172
Well, if you're here
to tell me not to play dirty,

801
00:32:12,174 --> 00:32:13,873
you're wasting your breath
because Donna already did it.

802
00:32:13,909 --> 00:32:14,909
I'm not here to do that,

803
00:32:14,910 --> 00:32:16,242
because you already played dirty.

804
00:32:16,278 --> 00:32:18,623
I'm here to get you to vote
against suspending Harvey.

805
00:32:18,723 --> 00:32:20,572
How the hell have I already played dirty?

806
00:32:20,608 --> 00:32:22,858
You knew my partnership
would mean something to Harvey,

807
00:32:22,893 --> 00:32:24,827
and instead of holding
it outside of your feud,

808
00:32:24,862 --> 00:32:27,058
you used it to trick him
back into the firm.

809
00:32:27,158 --> 00:32:29,642
Because, Mike, it was
the only way to get justice.

810
00:32:29,694 --> 00:32:31,360
Okay.

811
00:32:31,396 --> 00:32:33,629
If you think that, then
let me put this in terms

812
00:32:33,665 --> 00:32:34,997
that you might understand.

813
00:32:35,033 --> 00:32:37,900
Harvey is Jon Snow, I'm his Uncle Benjen,

814
00:32:37,935 --> 00:32:40,466
and you used me to lure him out

815
00:32:40,566 --> 00:32:42,366
so that everybody could stab him to death.

816
00:32:42,401 --> 00:32:43,584
How dare you defile <i>Game of Thrones</i>

817
00:32:43,619 --> 00:32:44,935
by comparing Harvey to Jon Snow.

818
00:32:44,970 --> 00:32:46,303
That's not the point, and you know it.

819
00:32:46,338 --> 00:32:47,938
The point is, you betrayed Harvey,

820
00:32:47,973 --> 00:32:50,140
the same way that kid betrayed Jon Snow.

821
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:51,909
Well, in that case, it was
for the good of The Watch.

822
00:32:51,961 --> 00:32:54,811
Yeah, I'm sure that's what
that kid thought, too.

823
00:32:54,847 --> 00:32:57,247
But I guarantee you, he's going
to regret stabbing his friend

824
00:32:57,249 --> 00:32:59,650
for the rest of his miserable life.

825
00:33:27,493 --> 00:33:29,026
Daniel Hardman's office.

826
00:33:29,061 --> 00:33:30,444
I need to speak to him right now.

827
00:33:30,479 --> 00:33:31,629
Who may I say is calling?

828
00:33:31,664 --> 00:33:33,497
You know who it is, Stacy.

829
00:33:33,532 --> 00:33:35,065
Now get him on the goddamn phone.

830
00:33:35,117 --> 00:33:37,801
He's not here, but he left word for you.

831
00:33:37,853 --> 00:33:39,186
He sent two packages.

832
00:33:39,238 --> 00:33:40,604
Either move forward on one of them,

833
00:33:40,606 --> 00:33:42,206
or he'll move forward on the other.

834
00:33:57,579 --> 00:34:00,513
- Congratulations.
- On what?

835
00:34:00,549 --> 00:34:04,751
On winning your first
case as junior partner.

836
00:34:04,946 --> 00:34:06,813
I won my first case as junior partner?

837
00:34:06,848 --> 00:34:09,833
Mm-hmm, turns out
you had a brilliant idea.

838
00:34:09,885 --> 00:34:12,519
Oh, really?
And what was my brilliant idea?

839
00:34:12,554 --> 00:34:13,653
You know, for when I'm sitting around

840
00:34:13,688 --> 00:34:15,368
shooting the shit with the other partners.

841
00:34:15,447 --> 00:34:16,746
You sent me back to Claire

842
00:34:16,782 --> 00:34:19,883
to propose that she have one
of her own clients buy Metadesk

843
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:21,885
and let Optela stay on board.

844
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:23,753
Rachel, that's amazing.

845
00:34:23,789 --> 00:34:25,124
I can't believe she went for it.

846
00:34:25,126 --> 00:34:28,361
She went for it, and GigaDyne went for it.

847
00:34:28,396 --> 00:34:29,495
Did you just say GigaDyne?

848
00:34:29,530 --> 00:34:31,398
Yeah.
Why?

849
00:34:31,498 --> 00:34:32,847
Rachel, GigaDyne just announced
they're getting into

850
00:34:32,882 --> 00:34:34,162
the defense contracting business.

851
00:34:34,167 --> 00:34:35,399
- What? When?
- Yeah.

852
00:34:35,435 --> 00:34:37,502
Yesterday... they already
have their first contract.

853
00:34:37,504 --> 00:34:39,237
Which means I just triggered
a background check

854
00:34:39,272 --> 00:34:41,606
on every single person
involved in this deal.

855
00:34:41,658 --> 00:34:44,242
Mike, I am so sorry.

856
00:34:44,294 --> 00:34:45,743
No, you couldn't have known.

857
00:34:45,745 --> 00:34:47,295
And we don't have time
for "I'm sorrys anyway."

858
00:34:47,330 --> 00:34:48,546
We have to find a way to take care of this

859
00:34:48,581 --> 00:34:49,581
before it's too late.

860
00:34:49,582 --> 00:34:51,082
How are we gonna do that?

861
00:34:53,086 --> 00:34:55,586
We're gonna hide in plain sight.

862
00:34:55,638 --> 00:34:56,921
I don't understand.

863
00:34:56,973 --> 00:34:58,139
We're gonna take my name
off all of the paperwork,

864
00:34:58,174 --> 00:34:59,894
and we're gonna hope to God nobody notices.

865
00:35:08,208 --> 00:35:10,510
What are you doing in here?

866
00:35:10,545 --> 00:35:13,212
Catching up on my work.

867
00:35:13,248 --> 00:35:14,630
- Is that a problem?
- No.

868
00:35:14,666 --> 00:35:16,249
It's just that I told you

869
00:35:16,284 --> 00:35:18,751
that I didn't need you
to do any transcribing.

870
00:35:18,786 --> 00:35:21,187
And the way you said it got me thinking

871
00:35:21,222 --> 00:35:24,290
about how you like making
your plans on this thing.

872
00:35:24,742 --> 00:35:27,960
And then I came across this.

873
00:35:28,012 --> 00:35:29,245
Donna...

874
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,313
You think me opening up

875
00:35:30,348 --> 00:35:32,598
about having panic attacks is manipulation?

876
00:35:32,650 --> 00:35:34,450
I don't even think you
really had panic attacks,

877
00:35:34,485 --> 00:35:35,418
let alone are going to therapy.

878
00:35:35,453 --> 00:35:36,485
Well, I am.

879
00:35:36,521 --> 00:35:38,120
And I opened up to you about it,

880
00:35:38,172 --> 00:35:39,555
and then you looked me in the eye,

881
00:35:39,557 --> 00:35:41,757
and you used Mike's
partnership to lure me back.

882
00:35:41,793 --> 00:35:43,392
Yes.

883
00:35:43,428 --> 00:35:44,927
I did.

884
00:35:45,889 --> 00:35:48,923
Because I wanted you to know
how it feels when someone

885
00:35:48,958 --> 00:35:52,193
says one thing to your face
and then turns right around

886
00:35:52,228 --> 00:35:53,988
and does the exact
opposite, like you did...

887
00:35:55,098 --> 00:35:57,431
He revealed those things to you,

888
00:35:57,467 --> 00:36:01,202
and you recorded him so you
could play it for the partners?

889
00:36:01,237 --> 00:36:02,870
I wasn't trying to record
him saying those things.

890
00:36:02,872 --> 00:36:04,338
I just wanted proof that he hit me.

891
00:36:04,374 --> 00:36:06,307
Bullshit!

892
00:36:07,141 --> 00:36:08,524
You didn't care what you got.

893
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:10,426
- You just wanted to get him.
- You're damn right I did.

894
00:36:10,462 --> 00:36:12,062
He hit me.

895
00:36:12,097 --> 00:36:14,264
He got Esther.

896
00:36:14,299 --> 00:36:16,016
He gets away with everything.

897
00:36:16,051 --> 00:36:18,201
Maybe he does.

898
00:36:18,236 --> 00:36:20,637
And if you want to try
to get him suspended,

899
00:36:20,672 --> 00:36:22,005
that's your right.

900
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:28,978
But if you use his weaknesses
to publicly humiliate him,

901
00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:31,363
I'm done working for you.

902
00:36:47,159 --> 00:36:48,575
Rachel,

903
00:36:48,627 --> 00:36:49,760
what are you doing here?

904
00:36:49,762 --> 00:36:51,211
We already sent back all of the contracts.

905
00:36:51,301 --> 00:36:52,384
I know, I just came by

906
00:36:52,386 --> 00:36:53,985
because you missed a
signature on the last page.

907
00:36:54,021 --> 00:36:55,187
No, I didn't miss it.

908
00:36:55,222 --> 00:36:56,288
I was holding off on signing it.

909
00:36:56,322 --> 00:36:57,388
Why?

910
00:36:57,423 --> 00:36:59,183
Because I was wondering
why you made changes

911
00:36:59,289 --> 00:37:01,609
to seven different addendums
without redlining them for me.

912
00:37:01,691 --> 00:37:04,793
They're just signatory pages
of a few lists of partners,

913
00:37:04,795 --> 00:37:06,594
so I didn't think that
that warranted a redline.

914
00:37:06,646 --> 00:37:08,006
You didn't or your partner didn't?

915
00:37:08,031 --> 00:37:10,131
Neither of us did.
He has a big client in defense,

916
00:37:10,167 --> 00:37:11,883
and so even though we don't rep GigaDyne,

917
00:37:11,935 --> 00:37:13,735
he was worried they might
see it as a conflict.

918
00:37:13,770 --> 00:37:16,104
The reason he's worried
is not because of a conflict.

919
00:37:16,139 --> 00:37:19,824
It's because this transaction
triggers a background check.

920
00:37:19,876 --> 00:37:21,593
- Which means...
- I told you the reason.

921
00:37:21,997 --> 00:37:23,357
He's repping another client and...

922
00:37:23,382 --> 00:37:25,081
He's lying to you, Rachel.

923
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,763
You're gonna find this
impossible to believe,

924
00:37:26,815 --> 00:37:28,848
but Mike Ross is a fraud,
and he knows that I know.

925
00:37:28,884 --> 00:37:30,284
That's why he sent you
in at the last minute

926
00:37:30,319 --> 00:37:31,685
when this was his deal from day one.

927
00:37:31,687 --> 00:37:34,088
Are you crazy? He's a partner
at Pearson, Specter, Litt,

928
00:37:34,090 --> 00:37:36,256
and you said your Mike Ross wasn't 45.

929
00:37:36,292 --> 00:37:37,524
So the Mike that I know...

930
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:39,243
Oh, my God, you know.

931
00:37:42,398 --> 00:37:45,015
I don't know anything,
except that we just need...

932
00:37:45,115 --> 00:37:47,248
I'm calling the D.A.'s Office
right now if you don't tell me

933
00:37:47,284 --> 00:37:50,185
what the hell's going on.

934
00:37:52,489 --> 00:37:54,456
We're engaged.

935
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:58,626
So it is him.

936
00:37:58,679 --> 00:38:01,046
Claire, please, you can't turn him in.

937
00:38:01,098 --> 00:38:03,882
This isn't about what I can't do.

938
00:38:03,934 --> 00:38:06,968
How could you be with a man
like that after you found out?

939
00:38:06,970 --> 00:38:10,805
Because I already loved him.

940
00:38:10,807 --> 00:38:11,856
Well, I'm sorry, Rachel.

941
00:38:11,892 --> 00:38:13,208
I just can't turn the other way.

942
00:38:13,243 --> 00:38:14,963
Don't you understand
what this is condoning?

943
00:38:14,978 --> 00:38:16,144
Yes, I understand what it's condoning,

944
00:38:16,146 --> 00:38:18,863
but you have to put yourself in my shoes.

945
00:38:18,899 --> 00:38:21,616
Imagine you found out a year later,

946
00:38:21,651 --> 00:38:24,569
after you already knew
the kind of man he is inside.

947
00:38:24,621 --> 00:38:26,621
Look, Claire, I'm...

948
00:38:26,656 --> 00:38:27,656
I'm telling you.

949
00:38:27,708 --> 00:38:32,243
No, he's not a lawyer,

950
00:38:32,295 --> 00:38:36,664
but he did turn his life around.

951
00:38:36,666 --> 00:38:40,668
You're a smart woman, Rachel.

952
00:38:40,670 --> 00:38:43,888
But you are making a huge mistake.

953
00:38:47,094 --> 00:38:53,098
Please, I am begging you.

954
00:39:15,348 --> 00:39:17,181
It's done.

955
00:39:17,233 --> 00:39:19,567
- She bought it?
- She did.

956
00:39:23,523 --> 00:39:26,941
I can't believe it.

957
00:39:26,993 --> 00:39:30,661
Did you think I couldn't handle it?

958
00:39:30,697 --> 00:39:34,198
I guess I was just worried
that she'd figure it out anyway,

959
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:35,449
expose me, and then...

960
00:39:35,501 --> 00:39:37,835
There is no "and then."

961
00:39:37,870 --> 00:39:39,870
Because that didn't happen.

962
00:39:42,342 --> 00:39:44,842
Because of you.

963
00:39:44,877 --> 00:39:46,677
Because of us.

964
00:39:48,681 --> 00:39:51,632
You're wearing your ring at the office.

965
00:39:51,684 --> 00:39:53,217
I am.

966
00:39:53,269 --> 00:39:56,470
What made you decide to do that?

967
00:39:56,522 --> 00:40:02,810
I...I just realized
how much I love you,

968
00:40:02,862 --> 00:40:06,147
and...

969
00:40:06,199 --> 00:40:09,450
that's not something I ever want to hide.

970
00:40:09,485 --> 00:40:10,568
Ra...

971
00:40:16,242 --> 00:40:17,242
Hey.

972
00:40:19,829 --> 00:40:21,879
Jessica, can I talk to you for a second?

973
00:40:21,914 --> 00:40:24,131
What is it, Louis?
I'm heading home for the night.

974
00:40:24,167 --> 00:40:25,416
I want to call off the vote.

975
00:40:25,418 --> 00:40:27,418
Excuse me?

976
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:29,220
The whole thing was a mistake.

977
00:40:29,255 --> 00:40:30,504
I want to call it off.

978
00:40:30,556 --> 00:40:32,757
Louis, the vote is tomorrow morning.

979
00:40:32,759 --> 00:40:34,225
The only way it doesn't happen

980
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:37,478
is if you publicly tell everyone
that Harvey didn't hit you.

981
00:40:37,513 --> 00:40:39,146
I can't do that.
I'll lose all credibility.

982
00:40:39,182 --> 00:40:41,515
Which is exactly why I wanted
Harvey to take two weeks.

983
00:40:41,567 --> 00:40:42,767
To let you calm down.

984
00:40:42,819 --> 00:40:45,603
Because I knew you'd change your mind.

985
00:40:45,605 --> 00:40:47,104
Now, if you'll excuse me,

986
00:40:47,156 --> 00:40:49,407
I have a vote to prepare for.

987
00:40:49,442 --> 00:40:51,275
Wait, what if I flip my vote?

988
00:40:51,277 --> 00:40:53,444
Flip whatever the hell you want, Louis.

989
00:40:53,496 --> 00:40:55,246
But you started this ball rolling,

990
00:40:55,281 --> 00:40:57,865
and now we all have to
live with the consequences.

991
00:41:15,885 --> 00:41:17,405
I thought you were trying to avoid me.

992
00:41:17,437 --> 00:41:19,136
I was.

993
00:41:19,138 --> 00:41:21,472
But then I figured out
you knew it was me anyway.

994
00:41:21,524 --> 00:41:22,773
How?

995
00:41:22,809 --> 00:41:23,858
Does it matter?

996
00:41:23,893 --> 00:41:28,362
No, it doesn't.

997
00:41:28,398 --> 00:41:31,365
So why are you here?

998
00:41:31,401 --> 00:41:33,984
I just wanted to say thank you.

999
00:41:34,037 --> 00:41:35,903
You're welcome.

1000
00:41:37,907 --> 00:41:40,908
I also wanted to know why
you're letting it go.

1001
00:41:44,047 --> 00:41:47,631
Because Rachel begged me to.

1002
00:41:47,667 --> 00:41:48,883
And because she said that she loved you

1003
00:41:48,918 --> 00:41:50,501
and that you turned your life around.

1004
00:41:50,503 --> 00:41:51,802
And you believed her?

1005
00:41:51,838 --> 00:41:53,671
I believe that she loves you.

1006
00:41:53,723 --> 00:41:55,339
But if you really want
to know the truth, no,

1007
00:41:55,391 --> 00:41:57,174
I don't believe that you
turned your life around,

1008
00:41:57,176 --> 00:41:59,477
and I definitely don't believe
that you love her.

1009
00:41:59,512 --> 00:42:01,011
What?
How can you say that?

1010
00:42:01,064 --> 00:42:03,898
Because you've convinced her
that it's all gonna be okay,

1011
00:42:03,933 --> 00:42:06,067
that you two are just gonna
get to live happily ever after,

1012
00:42:06,102 --> 00:42:07,068
and I didn't want to be the one

1013
00:42:07,103 --> 00:42:08,152
to make that all come crashing down.

1014
00:42:08,187 --> 00:42:09,320
But you know what, Mike?

1015
00:42:09,355 --> 00:42:11,439
One day, it is going to come crashing down.

1016
00:42:11,491 --> 00:42:13,157
And if you really do love her,

1017
00:42:13,192 --> 00:42:14,742
you'll put a stop to this right now.

1018
00:42:14,777 --> 00:42:17,194
So, you think I should stop being a lawyer?

1019
00:42:17,246 --> 00:42:20,781
I'm saying if you really
love her, you won't marry her.
