1
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:05,337
I just don't
understand.

2
00:00:05,463 --> 00:00:06,922
There's a lot of things that you
don't understand, especially...

3
00:00:07,048 --> 00:00:08,340
Everyone is wearing
a black tie.

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:09,967
And you're wearing
a gray tie.

5
00:00:10,093 --> 00:00:12,302
This is acceptable
at a black tie affair.

6
00:00:12,595 --> 00:00:13,971
There's nothing wrong
with the tie that I'm wearing.

7
00:00:14,097 --> 00:00:15,180
Thank you.

8
00:00:15,306 --> 00:00:16,807
- Would you like a glass?
- Yes, please.

9
00:00:16,933 --> 00:00:17,808
Champagne, sir?

10
00:00:18,184 --> 00:00:19,977
Is it?
From the region.

11
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:22,312
In France.

12
00:00:22,897 --> 00:00:24,690
Because if it's not,
it's called sparkling wine.

13
00:00:24,816 --> 00:00:26,191
And I don't really
drink sparkling wine.

14
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:27,401
Forget it.

15
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:30,821
Forgive him. His parents
really wanted a girl. Never got over it.

16
00:00:30,947 --> 00:00:32,156
Wait a minute, you can taste
the difference.

17
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:33,198
I'm not being a snob.

18
00:00:33,324 --> 00:00:35,534
Not a snob? You sound
like Frasier's brother.

19
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:37,286
Niles Crane was
completely misunderstood.

20
00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:38,287
Okay, boys.

21
00:00:38,413 --> 00:00:40,247
You don't want me to
give you a time out, now do you?

22
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:43,125
I'd be willing to stand in a corner,
if you agree to paddle his bottom.

23
00:00:43,251 --> 00:00:44,209
Oh, that's hilarious.

24
00:00:44,335 --> 00:00:46,837
I'm just saying, that if
they want us to donate to their charity,

25
00:00:46,963 --> 00:00:48,130
they might as well
step it up.

26
00:00:48,256 --> 00:00:49,548
You know, make me want
to give away my money.

27
00:00:49,674 --> 00:00:52,468
Your money? You're here representing
the firm, Louis.

28
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:55,179
And we've always been committed to
giving back to the community.

29
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:57,431
Jessica. Is that...

30
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:01,894
Tori, yes.
And I owe her a call.

31
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:03,020
Excuse me.

32
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:10,694
Do I smell like sausage?

33
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:12,488
No more than usual. Why?

34
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:15,240
Uh, because I'm about to meet the future
Mrs. Louis Litt.

35
00:01:15,366 --> 00:01:16,241
I had pizza
before I came,

36
00:01:16,367 --> 00:01:18,285
and I just want to make sure I still am
not emanating any aroma.

37
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:20,204
Oh, you're
emanating something.

38
00:01:20,705 --> 00:01:23,665
It's called pheromones. And women find
it irresistible.

39
00:01:26,294 --> 00:01:27,211
Watch.

40
00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:33,258
Harvey.

41
00:01:33,718 --> 00:01:35,094
You remember Tori?

42
00:01:35,386 --> 00:01:36,637
Of course.
Nice to see you.

43
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:38,180
I told Jessica,

44
00:01:38,306 --> 00:01:41,850
I don't really want to talk shop when
we're here to support a good cause.

45
00:01:41,976 --> 00:01:43,894
Well, that's the beautiful
thing about a retainer.

46
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,479
We're always on call
when you need us.

47
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:46,939
So, how can we help?

48
00:01:47,732 --> 00:01:50,943
It involves one of our
most trusted senior VPs.

49
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:54,488
Something recently came to light about
his past. I'm shocked by it, really.

50
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:57,324
Tell us where it hurts
and we'll make it go away.

51
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:09,253
Oh. Oh.

52
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:12,256
Wait.  Wait.

53
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:14,424
- Wait?
- Ah. Yeah. Let's just...

54
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:17,302
This feels like
it's moving really fast.

55
00:02:17,428 --> 00:02:18,846
I should slow down?

56
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:20,264
No. I just...
I mean, like...

57
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:23,142
I just got out of a relationship.
And...

58
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:25,936
- Right.
- You kind of did, too.

59
00:02:26,062 --> 00:02:27,521
I wasn't really
seeing anyone.

60
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:29,064
You know what I mean.

61
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,567
Trevor.

62
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:34,862
- Yeah. Trevor.
- That's right. Trevor.

63
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:36,155
- Uh.
- Uh.

64
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:39,199
Yeah. No, you're right.
We should slow down.

65
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:42,870
- I should make us some tea.
- Mmm.

66
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:43,954
- You want some tea?
- Yeah.

67
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,414
Yeah, let's
drink some tea.

68
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,756
What's the,
uh, Harvard Club?

69
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:59,136
Oh. It's a... It's, like, this clubhouse
for Harvard alumni.

70
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:01,430
Yeah, that invite is, uh...

71
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:04,892
It's for this networking
thing for lawyers. I got it at work.

72
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:06,894
Hmm. Would you go?

73
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,437
Wait, are you kidding me?

74
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:11,732
No. I have a hard enough time
pretending at work.

75
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:14,193
It's not like I want
to enter the lion's den.

76
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:20,574
Well, if you were
gonna go

77
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:24,119
and you were going
to take a date...

78
00:03:24,245 --> 00:03:25,454
It would be you.

79
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:28,916
I'd love to take you.

80
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:34,838
Uh-oh. Uh-oh.

81
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:36,506
Who's moving
too fast now?

82
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:39,635
Oh, I'll do it.
Saying all the right things.

83
00:03:43,264 --> 00:03:44,139
Mmm.

84
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:51,521
Hey.
What's the emergency?

85
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:53,023
Couldn't find
a date to the prom?

86
00:03:53,274 --> 00:03:54,775
We're firing
Stan Jacobson.

87
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:56,193
Who?

88
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,487
Senior Vice President,
Dreibach Accounting.

89
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:00,322
- Our accounting firm?
- Yes.

90
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:01,698
They're our firm
and our client.

91
00:04:01,824 --> 00:04:03,283
How's that possible?

92
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:06,161
They signed a conflict
of interest waiver.

93
00:04:06,287 --> 00:04:08,247
Look at that. He's actually learning
how the law works.

94
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:11,083
Acquaint yourself with Dreibach's
company charter

95
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:13,210
and Stan's original
employment contract.

96
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:14,795
- What did he do?
- He lied.

97
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:19,007
He lied? About what? Wait. Let me guess.
He cooked the books.

98
00:04:19,133 --> 00:04:22,177
God, doesn't anyone on Wall Street put
in an honest day's work anymore?

99
00:04:22,303 --> 00:04:24,972
Actually, he's got a stellar record
as a Senior VP.

100
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:26,890
He lied on his resume.

101
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:30,519
Never got a CPA license, never even went
to business school.

102
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:33,230
He lied about where
he went to school,

103
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:34,523
and now he's
getting fired?

104
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:37,734
Dreibach does the books
for half of Wall Street.

105
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:40,654
Word gets out that
a senior staff is a fraud,

106
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:41,947
they're going to start
bleeding clients.

107
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:44,908
We have to do this fast
and keep it quiet.

108
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:49,830
Relax. That's not
going to happen to you.

109
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:52,708
But I would get fired
if Jessica found out.

110
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:53,917
Found out what?

111
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:56,920
Just told me
he's a virgin.

112
00:04:58,131 --> 00:04:59,631
That doesn't
surprise me one bit.

113
00:05:00,174 --> 00:05:01,341
All in due time, Mike.

114
00:05:01,884 --> 00:05:03,510
You have those
severance quotes?

115
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:12,728
See the money wanna stay
for your meal

116
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:15,939
Get another piece of pie
for your wife

117
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:19,234
Everybody wanna know
how it feel

118
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:22,738
Everybody wanna see
what it's like

119
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:25,741
I'll even eat a bean pie
I don't mind

120
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:27,868
Me and missy is so early

121
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:29,745
Busy, busy making money

122
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:31,121
All right!

123
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:35,917
All step back
I'm 'bout to dance

124
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:38,837
The greenback boogie

125
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:00,442
Oh. Where you headed, doll?

126
00:06:00,568 --> 00:06:02,819
Pearson Hardman,
to see Mike Ross.

127
00:06:02,945 --> 00:06:04,905
Uh. He expecting you?

128
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:07,282
No, I just was going to
drop this off.

129
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:08,700
No appointment,
I can't let you up.

130
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:11,286
Do I look
like a terrorist?

131
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:12,913
Do I look like I want
to lose my job?

132
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:14,373
Jenny?

133
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:17,042
- Rachel.
- Hey. You here to see Mike?

134
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:19,753
Sort of. I just... I was going to drop
this suit off for him.

135
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:22,130
Harvey called late last night.
Some big emergency.

136
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:23,882
And Mike ended up
staying the night.

137
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:27,386
Actually, could you help me out?
I am running so late to work.

138
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:29,096
- Sure.
- Oh, my God. Thank you.

139
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:30,806
Oh.

140
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:31,807
Thanks.

141
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:32,808
- Okay.
- Thank you.

142
00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:36,812
Oh! And can you tell Mike that I left
the key under the mat?

143
00:06:37,438 --> 00:06:38,355
Absolutely.

144
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:40,273
- Thank you so much, Rachel.
- You're welcome.

145
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,525
You're amazing.

146
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:04,005
I'm up. I'm up.

147
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:07,008
Your girlfriend stopped by.
Dropped that off for you.

148
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:08,718
Girlfriend?

149
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:10,387
Did you guys move in
together already?

150
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:12,556
What? No, we...
She's not my...

151
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:14,015
- Why do you care?
- I don't.

152
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:16,435
What... What was
the big emergency last night?

153
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:17,853
Um... Harvey.

154
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:20,730
He's firing some big VP from our
accounting firm this morning.

155
00:07:21,065 --> 00:07:22,357
Stan Jacobson?

156
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,192
Yeah. Why?
You know him?

157
00:07:24,318 --> 00:07:26,403
No, he was just checking in at reception
when I got there.

158
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:28,905
Oh, my God.
I gotta change.

159
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:32,159
I will let him know
that you'll be right there?

160
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:33,952
- Thanks.
- Mmm-hmm.

161
00:07:44,922 --> 00:07:47,466
Performance numbers,
HR guidelines, severance quotes,

162
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:48,800
and Stan's
in the waiting room.

163
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:49,968
Did you sleep here
last night?

164
00:07:50,094 --> 00:07:51,386
I wouldn't exactly
call it sleeping.

165
00:07:51,762 --> 00:07:53,263
- Where did you get that suit?
- Uh, Rachel.

166
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:56,850
No, I mean, Jenny gave it to Rachel
downstairs.

167
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:59,936
She slept over last night.
Jenny did. Not Rachel.

168
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:02,272
Do I really need to be here
when you fire this guy?

169
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:03,940
You want to learn
how it's done, right?

170
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:07,903
I read this guy's employment records,
Harvey. He's smart, talented, loyal...

171
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:09,654
Aw, and you feel bad
for him. I'm shocked.

172
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:11,281
Where's my smoking gun?

173
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:15,327
The background check that confirmed Stan
lied about his credentials.

174
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:16,578
It never came through.

175
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:18,914
On it.

176
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:23,710
Come in. Come in.

177
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:25,086
Um, could you help me
with something?

178
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:26,671
I need to get this fax
for Harvey, and...

179
00:08:26,797 --> 00:08:27,923
Good morning.

180
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:30,175
Good morning.
He needs a...

181
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:33,136
You can tell, can't you?
I bet you everybody can.

182
00:08:34,263 --> 00:08:35,514
Tell what?

183
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:39,434
You waxed your eyebrows?

184
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,978
I was with the most
beautiful woman last night.

185
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:45,148
Um, she waxed
your eyebrows?

186
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:46,608
We did a lot of things
last night,

187
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:48,944
and waxing wasn't
one of them,

188
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:50,695
if you know what I mean.

189
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:54,032
Oh, God. Uh. Well, that's great.
I'm here to ask...

190
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:55,992
Her name's Charisse, and we have
so much in common.

191
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:58,036
And Mike,
there was like this...

192
00:08:58,162 --> 00:08:59,120
There was like this...
Mmm.

193
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:00,205
- Mmm-mmm.
- You know, like...

194
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:01,831
- Like a... Mmm.
- Mmm.

195
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:04,000
Like a chemical thing that would happen
when our bodies would touch.

196
00:09:04,126 --> 00:09:06,086
No, I really don't want to have this
conversation with you.

197
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:07,963
Oh, come on.
We're both guys. Right?

198
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:09,297
Little locker room
talk around the office?

199
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:10,507
I mean, that creates
a little male bonding.

200
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:13,009
Yeah. That's crazy, I just heard my
name. Did you hear that?

201
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:14,469
Someone's calling.
I'm gonna just...

202
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:15,971
One second, okay?

203
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,015
He's probably
still a virgin.

204
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:20,141
Mr. Jacobson.

205
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:21,643
Hi. Mike Ross,
Harvey's associate.

206
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:22,894
So sorry to
keep you waiting.

207
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:26,106
It's just going to be a couple more
minutes, okay? Okay, great. Thank you.

208
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:29,776
Yes, I hear you. Your office couldn't
find a copy.

209
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:31,945
Can you tell me the name
of the security firm you guys used

210
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:33,572
to do the background check?

211
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:37,993
Okay, great. Uh, nope, that's great.
I found the number myself.

212
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:39,202
Thank you.

213
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:41,913
Sally. Yes, this is Mike Ross
from Pearson Hardman.

214
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:44,499
I'm calling regarding
a background check you guys did...

215
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:46,042
Uh, sure.

216
00:09:46,168 --> 00:09:50,046
You could refuse to cooperate.
But then, you would be wrong.

217
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:52,090
Uh, Sally,
hold on one minute?

218
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:56,845
Yeah. Uh, no. Stan is going
to be there in two minutes.

219
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:58,680
He's in the bathroom.
Okay.

220
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:02,684
Sally, you there?

221
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:04,185
Let's do this. Uh...

222
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:07,522
I'm going to fax you the subpoena that
I'm holding in my hand right now,

223
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:10,191
and you can show that
to your boss and then we...

224
00:10:11,902 --> 00:10:15,280
Great. Uh, let me send you
my fax number now.

225
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:17,991
Yes.

226
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:28,668
Stan.

227
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:30,754
Oh! Hey. We ready?

228
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,963
Yes. I'm sorry
about that.

229
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:33,381
No worries.

230
00:10:33,507 --> 00:10:35,216
I know you,
by the way.

231
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:38,011
7-6-1-1-0-5-3.

232
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:41,139
Your employee code.

233
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:42,807
- See, I remember everyone that way.
- Ah.

234
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:44,643
Anyway, you are taking me
to see Harvey.

235
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:46,061
I have been dying
to meet him.

236
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:48,313
- Why is that?
- His balls.

237
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:52,067
His autographed ones?
I'm a huge baseball fan.

238
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:53,276
Oh! Right. Really?

239
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:55,403
Oh, yeah, yeah.
No, if I wasn't an accountant,

240
00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:57,030
I would be
a major league scout.

241
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:58,198
I can tell you anything
you want to know

242
00:10:58,324 --> 00:10:59,991
- just by looking at somebody's numbers.
- Huh.

243
00:11:00,117 --> 00:11:02,410
For instance, slugging percentage
versus strike-outs

244
00:11:02,536 --> 00:11:03,578
- during spring training...
- Do you...

245
00:11:03,704 --> 00:11:05,372
Do you want to walk and talk?
Maybe?

246
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:06,498
Ah. See, the thing is,

247
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:09,250
it's usually what we call
in the trade a miscorrelation.

248
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:11,378
Stan Jacobson...

249
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:13,755
Mr. Specter,
it is a pleasure.

250
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:15,256
Stan, it's nice to meet you.
Has Mike...

251
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:18,677
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Is that them?

252
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:20,387
Oh!

253
00:11:21,138 --> 00:11:23,682
Jeter. Hank Aaron.

254
00:11:24,308 --> 00:11:26,351
No way. Maris?

255
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:28,269
That's not number 61,
is it?

256
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:30,063
No, but it was
signed by Tracy...

257
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:31,272
Stallard.

258
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:34,359
Big baseball fan.

259
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:36,653
Stan, why don't you have
a seat over here?

260
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:38,613
Why don't I, uh,
get us some waters?

261
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,409
Sorry. I get talking about
baseball, I cannot stop.

262
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:45,578
Well, I know how
valuable your time is.

263
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:47,163
I do do the books.

264
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:49,708
And speaking of which,
your assistant tells me

265
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:52,293
you wanted to go over something from
your last audit.

266
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,003
I could really
use a water.

267
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:58,800
Stan, we're not here to go over any
accounting business.

268
00:11:58,926 --> 00:12:00,719
You're here because
you're being let go.

269
00:12:02,346 --> 00:12:03,430
What?

270
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:06,558
It's not going to feel as
surprising when you understand why.

271
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:08,476
The firm looked
into your background recently.

272
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:11,062
They know you lied
about passing the CPA exam.

273
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:14,190
You were hired because of your
outstanding credentials

274
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:16,317
and the reality is,
they never existed.

275
00:12:21,198 --> 00:12:23,032
I've been there
for nine years.

276
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:25,243
My work has
been nothing but...

277
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:27,704
I mean, why would this
even matter now?

278
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:31,082
You've been committing fraud your entire
career. The liability it presents...

279
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:33,001
No, I don't accept this.

280
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:35,795
Take a deep breath. Once you go over
the severance numbers,

281
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:38,047
you'll see that we've been
more than fair.

282
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:40,133
Fair.

283
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:43,219
You think this is fair?

284
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:47,557
We understand how difficult this must
be, Stan. How you must feel right now.

285
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:49,642
You have no idea
what I feel right now.

286
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:55,690
So I'm clear, you're not denying
what we're presenting you with.

287
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:59,944
You mean that I lied back when
Dreibach hired me?

288
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:05,033
No.

289
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:07,827
But I'm not some
scam artist either.

290
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:09,662
I did go to college.
I just...

291
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:11,581
couldn't afford
to graduate.

292
00:13:11,707 --> 00:13:12,999
No one ever
questioned it before

293
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,834
because I'm that good
with numbers.

294
00:13:18,422 --> 00:13:20,423
How did they find out
all of a sudden?

295
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:22,425
They didn't.

296
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:27,472
This background check
is five years old.

297
00:13:28,432 --> 00:13:31,017
What?
That doesn't make sense.

298
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:33,436
- Is this the original?
- Yeah.

299
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,940
So, Tori knew
all this time.

300
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:42,153
This is the same thing
that happened to Paula.

301
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:43,154
Who?

302
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,155
Paula.

303
00:13:44,281 --> 00:13:45,573
Discovered some
undisclosed income.

304
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:46,741
The books weren't
adding up.

305
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:49,410
She brought it to me.
The next thing I know, she is gone.

306
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:52,247
I asked Tori about it, then I started
getting shut out of meetings.

307
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:55,291
They're trying to hide something,
and they're firing me so they can.

308
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:56,793
Hey. Where are you going?

309
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:59,045
I'm not signing some agreement.
Are you kidding me?

310
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:00,338
I'm getting railroaded.

311
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:02,674
Should I go after him?

312
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,551
No. You've done
enough already.

313
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:12,892
So, you let him leave?

314
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:16,145
Physically restraining someone
is not in my job description.

315
00:14:16,897 --> 00:14:20,149
What about your associate? The one who
shared the background check.

316
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:22,735
That was a confidential
internal document.

317
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:24,028
Stan should have
never seen it.

318
00:14:24,154 --> 00:14:25,488
Why did you
even have it?

319
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:27,907
You didn't expect us to fire him without
proof, did you?

320
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:30,368
Tori's right. Stan shouldn't
have seen it.

321
00:14:30,494 --> 00:14:32,370
Then, I'm guilty
of being thorough.

322
00:14:32,496 --> 00:14:34,581
Hey. I still don't understand why you
haven't told us the whole truth.

323
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,457
I mean, if you knew
five years ago,

324
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:38,293
why did you make it sound like this is
something recent?

325
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:40,378
Because it only
came to my attention two days ago.

326
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:41,713
Then who ordered
the background check?

327
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,257
It's routine. You check
with human resources.

328
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:46,050
Is it routine for
human resources

329
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:48,678
to keep something from the CEO
for half a decade?

330
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:50,430
What are you
insinuating?

331
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:53,641
I think what
Harvey is saying is,

332
00:14:53,767 --> 00:14:56,227
given how quickly we tried
to accomplish this,

333
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:58,438
some of the details
might have gotten lost.

334
00:14:58,772 --> 00:15:01,691
What was also lost is that Stan never
signed the severance package,

335
00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:03,902
which included
the confidentiality agreement.

336
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:05,570
Which means if he
decides to make waves,

337
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:07,572
the whole point of
avoiding negative publicity...

338
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:09,782
Harvey will
track down Stan,

339
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:12,285
and make sure that he signs
the severance package

340
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:14,787
and the confidentiality
agreement today.

341
00:15:15,664 --> 00:15:16,789
You have my word.

342
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,877
- Thank you.
- Of course.

343
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:28,092
- I'll be in touch.
- All right, sweetie.

344
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:35,558
She's lying. She knew about Stan.
She's known for a long time.

345
00:15:35,684 --> 00:15:37,060
And that matters
to us why?

346
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:38,895
Because she's
taking advantage of us.

347
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:40,104
We are being manipulated

348
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:42,982
into firing one of her employees
and told not to ask questions.

349
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:44,776
Well, I have questions.

350
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:46,903
And the answer, is 10.

351
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:50,198
As in $10 million per year.

352
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:53,576
The amount of business
Dreibach generates for this firm.

353
00:15:53,869 --> 00:15:56,454
Which means you have to finish
what you started.

354
00:15:56,872 --> 00:15:59,165
Find Stan and get him
to sign those documents.

355
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,417
Oh, and as far
as I'm concerned,

356
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:03,962
that little associate of yours
is to blame for all of this.

357
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:05,171
That was an honest mistake.

358
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:08,841
He knowingly revealed a client's
confidential document.

359
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,969
That is not a mistake.

360
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:14,639
How many more chances are you going
to give that kid?

361
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:17,016
Oh, I didn't realize
we were keeping score.

362
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:20,228
But if that's the case, I still think
he's coming out ahead.

363
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:32,115
Whatever you're
doing, stop.

364
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:33,574
No, you're going to
want to see this.

365
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:36,285
Paula O'Neil? The former Dreibach
employee that Stan mentioned?

366
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:39,998
She filed a wrongful termination suit
that mysteriously went away.

367
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:41,958
Really?
Let me see that.

368
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:46,045
Come with me.

369
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:50,508
Wait. Do you not think
something funny is going on?

370
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:52,093
You know what?
Here's what I think is going on.

371
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:54,178
You're sympathizing with Stan
because you think he's you.

372
00:16:54,304 --> 00:16:55,221
That doesn't mean that...

373
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:57,056
You need to learn something
from what just happened.

374
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:59,100
Not the least of which is
how anyone,

375
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:01,185
no matter how valuable,
can be let go.

376
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:02,979
I can chalk up
what happened with Stan

377
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:05,565
to youthful exuberance,
but Jessica can't.

378
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:07,859
So, if you want to work here,
you better go home now,

379
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:09,569
- because if she sees you...
- Wait, wait. Is she going to fire me?

380
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:11,738
This habit of you empathizing
with every client,

381
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:13,322
it's not getting you
anywhere.

382
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:17,493
You want to work in this firm?
You need to deal in facts, evidence,

383
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:19,162
information that
can hold up.

384
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:21,706
That's what
a real lawyer does.

385
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:40,600
Stan.

386
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:44,228
Did you follow me here?

387
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:47,065
It doesn't take a sleuth to figure out
that your next step

388
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:48,441
would be to see
another lawyer.

389
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:50,318
Vople and Williams.

390
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:54,113
They're a good firm.
Not the friendliest bunch.

391
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:56,032
If they called you, that is against
lawyer-client privilege.

392
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:57,950
No one's breaking
any laws, okay?

393
00:17:58,077 --> 00:17:59,994
My assistant has a network
of other assistants

394
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,746
that tell her anything
she wants to know.

395
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:04,415
Like when someone calls
for an emergency appointment.

396
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:05,917
You forgot this
when you left.

397
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:07,376
I said I'm not
signing anything.

398
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:10,338
It's nothing to sign.
It's a lawsuit.

399
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:14,842
You worked for Dreibach for nine years.
Oversaw 80 clients.

400
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:18,012
Filed hundreds of tax returns
and fought 27 audits.

401
00:18:18,722 --> 00:18:21,099
Now, in light of your
recently discovered fraud,

402
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:23,309
all of that can now
be called into question.

403
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:27,063
Therefore, you're being sued
for nine years back pay,

404
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:30,191
plus any expenses incurred
to mitigate the damage you've done.

405
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:31,984
This is...

406
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:34,821
This would bankrupt me.

407
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:37,323
Or you can take what's
behind door number two.

408
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:42,161
It's Aberdeen.

409
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:43,454
Who?

410
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:44,622
It's not a who,
it's a what.

411
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:46,082
Dreibach is doing
business with them,

412
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:47,542
and I think that's
where the problem was.

413
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:50,503
You don't get it, okay?
I'm only leaving with one of these.

414
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:52,171
And if it's the lawsuit,

415
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:53,589
the first thing
your friends upstairs

416
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:55,883
are going to ask you for
is a big, fat retainer.

417
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:58,719
And when you tell them that Harvey
Specter is the one that's suing you,

418
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:00,805
you're going to watch the color drain
from their faces.

419
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:02,640
Now, what would
you like to do?

420
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:11,732
This is not cool. You leave me
in your apartment all night

421
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:13,109
and say you're going
to be right back.

422
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:14,986
You don't even thank me
for dropping off your suit.

423
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:16,529
I had a bad day, Jenny.

424
00:19:17,197 --> 00:19:18,322
So, you couldn't call me.

425
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:20,074
I almost got fired, okay?

426
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:22,076
What happened?

427
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:24,328
It... It's not worth
explaining.

428
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:29,584
Okay. I need to find evidence that our
accounting firm is up to something,

429
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:32,795
so, I found this woman who filed a
wrongful termination suit against them,

430
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:34,046
and she referred
me to her lawyer.

431
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:35,256
Did you call them?

432
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:37,717
Yeah, but they're this huge firm,
Unger and Macy.

433
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:39,385
They wouldn't
take my call.

434
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:40,970
Why not?

435
00:19:41,096 --> 00:19:44,015
There's a confidentiality clause
in the settlement, for one.

436
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:45,224
So?

437
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:49,145
So, it means that
they can't share details like that.

438
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:52,023
Yeah, I thought all lawyers
secretly shared that stuff.

439
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:54,192
You're all in
the same club, right?

440
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,154
What? That's not a dumb
thing to assume.

441
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:01,365
No. No, no, no. That's not dumb at all.
Because...

442
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:09,165
Unger and Macy have almost as many
Harvard grads as we do, which means...

443
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:10,416
They're going to be
at the mixer tonight.

444
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:14,045
And there are two things
that lawyers love to do. Drink and talk.

445
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:17,506
Hi.

446
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:18,466
Hi.

447
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:20,968
Uh, Mike Ross,
class of 2011?

448
00:20:21,261 --> 00:20:23,429
Ross. I'm sorry.
I don't have you on here.

449
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:25,932
Do you have your ID?
I can run it through the computer.

450
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:27,308
Uh, my Harvard ID?

451
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:29,936
What did you say
your name was again?

452
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:32,438
- Michael Ross, of Pearson Hardman.
- Michael Ross...

453
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:37,443
Boy, you think they ask Harvey
for his ID when he comes to this place?

454
00:20:37,694 --> 00:20:41,280
Harvey Specter? You work with
Harvey Specter?

455
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:45,159
Uh, yeah. Yes.
I'm his associate.

456
00:20:45,285 --> 00:20:46,827
I can call him
if you like.

457
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:49,163
Just don't tell him I gave you
any trouble, okay?

458
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:52,124
Welcome.

459
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:53,209
Thank you.

460
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:57,755
Mmm. Oh, God. I'm never going
to survive this.

461
00:20:58,215 --> 00:21:00,132
Deep breaths.
You'll be fine.

462
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:14,355
Hey.

463
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:17,233
I saw the signed severance papers on my
desk. Thank you.

464
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:18,859
And I also left word
for Tori.

465
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:20,569
Yes, we spoke.
She's relieved,

466
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:23,281
but I wouldn't go so far as to say
completely forgiving.

467
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:25,199
You ever heard
of Aberdeen Solutions?

468
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:28,286
Dreibach listed them
as a consultant firm.

469
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:31,247
They bill us every month
for their management services.

470
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:33,040
- Okay...
- What does that mean?

471
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:34,417
Well, check
with accounting.

472
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:37,962
I did. They can only tell me
how much we pay them.

473
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:39,880
So, I called
Aberdeen directly.

474
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:41,590
It's an automated
answering system.

475
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:44,343
I left six messages.
No returns.

476
00:21:44,761 --> 00:21:47,305
Stan mentioned it. Something just
doesn't feel right.

477
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:51,183
Are you saying you want to
investigate our client?

478
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,601
They're also
our accountants.

479
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:54,145
And Tori is
also a friend.

480
00:21:56,398 --> 00:21:58,024
Harvey, if you
got caught and didn't...

481
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,400
I wouldn't get caught.

482
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:05,614
I am explicitly telling
you not to do this.

483
00:22:06,908 --> 00:22:10,786
Oh. Then, I'll let you know what I don't
find after I don't look into it.

484
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:29,805
Hey, should we get the rest of the 2010
grads with us for a pic?

485
00:22:29,931 --> 00:22:31,390
The rest?
This is 2011 only.

486
00:22:31,808 --> 00:22:33,225
Isn't he from
the 2010 class?

487
00:22:36,396 --> 00:22:37,563
Hey, who is that guy?

488
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:40,316
No. No, I was 2011.

489
00:22:41,234 --> 00:22:42,485
You're not with us.

490
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:44,487
Yeah, Rudy. It's Mike.

491
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:46,655
You know, we...
We hung out a bunch. You...

492
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:47,907
Where?

493
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:50,951
Oh, you know what? Maybe I'm thinking
about somebody else.

494
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:52,286
Sorry about that.

495
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:54,955
Has anyone seen
that guy here before?

496
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:55,915
Will you excuse me?

497
00:22:58,627 --> 00:23:00,586
Hey. I'm not
having any luck.

498
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:02,046
I wish I could say different, love,

499
00:23:02,172 --> 00:23:04,131
but it's been
a potter's field for me, too.

500
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:08,636
What? You get to pretend to be someone
else. I wanted to try. It's fun.

501
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:10,137
An accent? Hmm.

502
00:23:11,681 --> 00:23:14,308
Okay, I'll stop.
What?

503
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:16,435
You're amazing.

504
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:22,108
And that's Brian Jennings.

505
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:23,692
Who's Brian Jennings?

506
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:25,986
I saw his face on Unger and Macy's
website today.

507
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:28,030
What are you
waiting for? Go.

508
00:23:35,122 --> 00:23:36,122
Hi.

509
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:38,707
10 days for public exposure.

510
00:23:39,459 --> 00:23:41,335
Next time you need a bathroom
in Times Square,

511
00:23:41,461 --> 00:23:42,795
go into a hotel.

512
00:23:44,881 --> 00:23:46,173
Five minute recess.

513
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:53,013
Harvey.

514
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:54,640
Long time, Anthony.

515
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:55,766
Huh.

516
00:23:55,892 --> 00:23:58,519
You keep company with the high rollers
on Centre Street.

517
00:23:59,396 --> 00:24:01,439
What are you doing
down in night court?

518
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,065
Need a favor.

519
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:05,651
What kind of favor?

520
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:07,987
One that requires access
to sealed court documents.

521
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:10,239
Can it wait till tomorrow?
I've got this backlog...

522
00:24:10,365 --> 00:24:13,159
When you came to me two years ago in
the middle of the night,

523
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:15,578
did I tell you it had to wait
till tomorrow?

524
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:19,081
My chambers.

525
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:24,211
So...
This is quite a surprise.

526
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,964
Who'd ever think that you and I would be
on a double date?

527
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:28,215
Excuse me?

528
00:24:28,341 --> 00:24:30,050
Oh, come on. You had to notice
when you walked in the room.

529
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:31,427
She's absolutely gorgeous.

530
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:33,762
She's completely infatuated with your
girlfriend.

531
00:24:35,515 --> 00:24:36,891
- Ah.
- Come on.

532
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:38,142
Come on.
I'll introduce you to her.

533
00:24:38,268 --> 00:24:42,354
Charisse, honey. Uh, this is one of my
associates, Mike Ross.

534
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:44,064
- Oh. So nice to meet you.
- Hi.

535
00:24:44,191 --> 00:24:45,316
And I'm in love
with your date.

536
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:48,777
Seriously. She's just been
telling me about her work with monkeys.

537
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:49,904
It's fascinating.

538
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:52,448
- Huh.
- So, really, they're as smart as us?

539
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:53,574
Oh, smarter.

540
00:24:54,618 --> 00:24:56,368
I never had
a chance with him.

541
00:24:57,662 --> 00:25:00,331
I need to use the ladies' room.
Would you excuse me?

542
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:04,168
Monkeys aren't smarter
than humans. I'm sorry.

543
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:07,087
Well, it depends on which humans you're
talking about, I guess.

544
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:08,547
- What?
- Huh?

545
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:11,175
Name of case and rough date.

546
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:14,053
Aberdeen v. Paula O'Neil.
Say, six months ago.

547
00:25:15,263 --> 00:25:16,514
Let's see.

548
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:20,226
Says here that they were listed as
a subsidiary of Dreibach

549
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:22,061
in a wrongful
termination suit.

550
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:23,354
That's it.
That's what I'm looking for.

551
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,189
I can't print this out.
It'll get tagged.

552
00:25:25,315 --> 00:25:27,066
Come around and
take a look.

553
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:29,360
Is that what
you were after?

554
00:25:29,486 --> 00:25:33,280
Yeah, that's it.
But what's that?

555
00:25:36,117 --> 00:25:39,245
That links to another
court filing in relation to Aberdeen.

556
00:25:39,746 --> 00:25:41,038
Click on it.

557
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:45,292
Says here that they
filed for dissolution. Earlier today?

558
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:47,253
The whole company?

559
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:50,130
That's what it says.
They're officially shut down.

560
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:52,258
I'm going to need
one more favor.

561
00:25:54,761 --> 00:25:57,054
I think it's great that you found
someone not in law,

562
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:58,305
who works out
in the real world.

563
00:25:58,431 --> 00:25:59,723
Why do you say that?

564
00:25:59,849 --> 00:26:01,350
Because I'm stuck
in a suit all day.

565
00:26:01,476 --> 00:26:03,227
Or an office,
or a courtroom.

566
00:26:03,353 --> 00:26:05,563
I think it would be nice to be in
nature. Don't you, Mike?

567
00:26:05,689 --> 00:26:07,690
Well, I love that
you're a lawyer.

568
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:09,108
In fact,

569
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:11,819
I'd love to see where
you work sometimes.

570
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:14,822
You would?

571
00:26:15,282 --> 00:26:17,491
I'm not feeling so well
all of a sudden.

572
00:26:17,617 --> 00:26:18,742
- No.
- Yeah.

573
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:20,494
- Do you think we can go?
- Yeah.

574
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:21,537
- Right now.
- Now.

575
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:23,247
- Yeah, so great to meet you.
- Lovely to meet you.

576
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:24,373
- Have a good night.
- Yeah. Bye.

577
00:26:24,499 --> 00:26:25,541
Bye.

578
00:26:27,043 --> 00:26:28,627
Okay. Why didn't you
do that sooner?

579
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:31,255
'Cause I had to
get this first.

580
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:34,675
That's the guy, right? From the firm.
That's his employee ID.

581
00:26:34,801 --> 00:26:35,634
He gave this to you?

582
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,802
No, I stole it.

583
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:38,429
What?

584
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:40,931
Listen. You can spend all night trying
to get to the guy,

585
00:26:41,057 --> 00:26:43,684
or you could just go
into his firm yourself and look.

586
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:46,061
- Come on.
- Let's go.

587
00:26:53,653 --> 00:26:55,863
Yeah, I can barely
keep my eyes open myself.

588
00:26:55,989 --> 00:26:58,449
They got me filing briefs.
Sucks.

589
00:27:25,101 --> 00:27:26,935
You actually came.

590
00:27:27,687 --> 00:27:30,064
You must be
Harvey Specter.

591
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:32,650
Joe, was it?

592
00:27:32,942 --> 00:27:34,860
Your friend fill you in on
the deal that's on the table?

593
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:36,528
Let me just
get it straight.

594
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:38,489
You caught him
rifling through some files

595
00:27:38,615 --> 00:27:40,908
and in lieu of calling
the police, you want me to pay you off?

596
00:27:41,368 --> 00:27:43,952
I never said that.
He did.

597
00:27:44,954 --> 00:27:46,288
Oh, that's great. This way,

598
00:27:46,414 --> 00:27:49,124
if I level a charge of extortion,
it's hearsay, huh?

599
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:52,044
Ten years working for a law firm,
you learn a thing or two.

600
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:54,797
Which is good, 'cause you sure as hell
don't make a lot of money doing it.

601
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:56,674
Somehow, I think
you're getting by fine.

602
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,009
Just say I know
the level you guys play at.

603
00:27:59,135 --> 00:28:00,511
Espionage happens
all the time,

604
00:28:00,637 --> 00:28:03,764
which is why I know you'll do anything
to protect your secrets.

605
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:08,143
Well, actually, Joe Spina of 2561 Clover
Lane in Astoria, Queens,

606
00:28:08,269 --> 00:28:09,520
I think we all would.

607
00:28:09,979 --> 00:28:13,273
Like those tax returns you filed jointly
for the last six years

608
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,067
while no longer
living with your wife.

609
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:17,486
You know, the IRS can
destroy you for that.

610
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:20,280
You think you're the first person to
try to extort me, Joe?

611
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:22,074
Because that's
the level I play at.

612
00:28:22,325 --> 00:28:25,994
Now, you're a security guard
who likes to take risks.

613
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:27,121
I like that.

614
00:28:27,247 --> 00:28:28,664
So, here's what
we're going to do.

615
00:28:28,915 --> 00:28:32,334
This here is a generous donation to Joey
Junior's little league team.

616
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:36,004
Now, if it gets to them, it gets to
them. If it doesn't, it doesn't.

617
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:39,591
But the next time we talk, it's going
to be me who wants a favor.

618
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:46,140
Officer.

619
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:48,976
Do I really need
to pay you back?

620
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:51,186
Let's start with
an explanation.

621
00:28:51,312 --> 00:28:53,856
You said I needed to find evidence.
So, I went to find some.

622
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:55,733
By breaking into
another law firm?

623
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:57,735
Is that really worse than paying off
a security guard?

624
00:28:57,861 --> 00:28:59,278
Okay. First of all,
I didn't pay him off.

625
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:03,115
Second of all, if I hadn't paid him off,
you'd be in jail right now.

626
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:05,200
You think I might
be right about Stan.

627
00:29:05,326 --> 00:29:06,827
No. I never said
you were wrong.

628
00:29:06,953 --> 00:29:08,370
I said
we needed evidence.

629
00:29:08,955 --> 00:29:10,748
What? Did you find something?

630
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:14,460
Dreibach bought a shelf company
13 months ago.

631
00:29:15,044 --> 00:29:16,545
What's a shelf company?

632
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:19,381
It's a corporation that exists
only on paper

633
00:29:19,507 --> 00:29:21,800
so its owners can
hide their assets.

634
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:23,135
Isn't that
a shell company?

635
00:29:23,386 --> 00:29:24,553
No, it's a shelf company.

636
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:26,388
Okay.
Take a shell company.

637
00:29:26,514 --> 00:29:29,224
Give it a bank account,
credit history, tax returns.

638
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:32,644
And let it season
for years on a shelf.

639
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:34,980
Someone buys it,
slots their name into it,

640
00:29:35,231 --> 00:29:39,359
and they walk away with an established
corporation with a pre-existing history.

641
00:29:39,819 --> 00:29:42,780
Anyone looks any closer, you shut it
down and do it again.

642
00:29:42,906 --> 00:29:43,947
That's legal?

643
00:29:44,073 --> 00:29:48,035
Shelf companies are legal. I'm guessing
what Tori's doing with hers isn't.

644
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:50,204
Wait a minute.
Is it called Aberdeen?

645
00:29:50,497 --> 00:29:54,249
Yeah, I saw it on the top of this list
with 37 other management companies,

646
00:29:54,375 --> 00:29:57,211
all related to Dreibach, in that
wrongful termination suit.

647
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:00,547
When we get back
to the office,

648
00:30:00,673 --> 00:30:04,092
I want you to find legal precedent that
will allow us to subpoena those records.

649
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:07,179
Okay. On it.
But do I really have to pay you back?

650
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:08,430
Every penny.

651
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:11,350
Wait a minute. How much was
in that envelope?

652
00:30:19,567 --> 00:30:21,109
Hey. What are you all
doing in my desk?

653
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:22,236
Dude, you gotta
check this out.

654
00:30:26,574 --> 00:30:28,242
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

655
00:30:30,954 --> 00:30:31,995
Is that Louis?

656
00:30:32,121 --> 00:30:33,080
Uh-huh.
In the lobby.

657
00:30:33,206 --> 00:30:34,706
Is this
a security camera?

658
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:36,124
A live feed?
What are you guys doing?

659
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:37,668
No, this is from last night.
The guys in security

660
00:30:37,794 --> 00:30:39,253
emailed it up
to Louis this morning.

661
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:41,755
And why are we watching it
on my computer?

662
00:30:41,881 --> 00:30:43,549
Well, we're not going to risk
watching it on one of ours.

663
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:44,967
And everyone knows your password.

664
00:30:45,468 --> 00:30:46,969
How does everybody
know my password?

665
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:49,304
Ross 999?
How hard is that to crack?

666
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:52,516
Okay, 999...
Increases the odds, okay.

667
00:30:52,642 --> 00:30:53,517
Shh. Here it comes.

668
00:30:54,602 --> 00:30:55,477
Oh!

669
00:30:55,603 --> 00:30:57,396
What?

670
00:30:58,106 --> 00:30:59,731
Oh!

671
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:03,694
Oh, no.
What did he say to her?

672
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:07,823
Evidently, Louis wants a restraining
order and he needs this as evidence.

673
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:12,286
What? Uh... Um...

674
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:13,954
Okay, listen.

675
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:18,000
Please don't...
I came in here and it... Look, I...

676
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:21,879
Are you okay?
Down... Louis.

677
00:31:28,094 --> 00:31:30,220
If the message you left was another
trick to get me down here...

678
00:31:30,346 --> 00:31:32,097
No tricks, I assure you.
Come on in.

679
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:33,390
Stan, I'm Jessica Pearson.

680
00:31:33,516 --> 00:31:34,975
Oh, yeah.
I know who you are.

681
00:31:35,101 --> 00:31:38,186
You said if I accepted the severance
agreement, there wouldn't be a lawsuit.

682
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:42,107
Well, there is one.
But not against you. With you.

683
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:46,236
We know about Aberdeen. We know what
Tori was orchestrating.

684
00:31:46,362 --> 00:31:48,572
And with your help,
we can expose her.

685
00:31:52,702 --> 00:31:53,952
Why should I help you?

686
00:31:54,621 --> 00:31:56,204
What have you
got to lose?

687
00:32:02,003 --> 00:32:03,503
Tell me what
you need me to do.

688
00:32:08,509 --> 00:32:09,635
Hey.

689
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:13,430
What does he have you
trying to find this time?

690
00:32:13,556 --> 00:32:15,140
You really want to know?

691
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:21,939
Uh, I managed to get a look at some
files involving our accounting firm.

692
00:32:22,565 --> 00:32:24,024
What's up with
our accounting firm?

693
00:32:24,525 --> 00:32:26,068
They're stealing from us.

694
00:32:27,403 --> 00:32:30,072
You know your phone bill,
you have all those surcharges?

695
00:32:30,198 --> 00:32:31,698
You have no idea what they mean,
but you pay them, anyway?

696
00:32:31,824 --> 00:32:32,699
Yeah.

697
00:32:32,825 --> 00:32:34,326
Yeah, well, Dreibach's doing
the same thing to us,

698
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:36,870
except all their charges
are a complete scam.

699
00:32:36,996 --> 00:32:39,081
Pretty sure
the phone charges are a scam, too.

700
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:40,874
Yeah. Maybe.

701
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,376
So, what do you need?

702
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:47,673
I need a legal reason to get those files
without saying I saw those files.

703
00:32:48,591 --> 00:32:51,051
You need them for court
or you just need them?

704
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:53,887
Why?

705
00:32:54,013 --> 00:32:55,222
Well, you said you
read them, right?

706
00:32:55,348 --> 00:32:56,223
Yeah.

707
00:32:56,349 --> 00:32:59,267
So, then, you already
have them. In here.

708
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:01,812
You're right.
I do.

709
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:03,897
Yes. So, you dictate,
I'll type.

710
00:33:04,899 --> 00:33:07,442
What? You'd actually
do that for me?

711
00:33:08,069 --> 00:33:10,904
They're stealing from us.
Pearson Hardman is my firm, too.

712
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:13,532
Come on.

713
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:15,826
Okay.

714
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:17,911
With the party of
the third part

715
00:33:18,037 --> 00:33:20,455
hereto referred to as
Norton LLC rendered to...

716
00:33:20,581 --> 00:33:22,958
Not the subject of any litigation
or any claim that

717
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:25,085
might be reasonably anticipated
to give rise...

718
00:33:25,211 --> 00:33:27,004
Being acknowledged that such appointment
is irrevocable

719
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:28,797
and shall be deemed
a power coupled with...

720
00:33:28,923 --> 00:33:31,299
Lawfully invested with the power to
make such contracts

721
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:32,968
or to perform acts

722
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:36,138
from which it may
be lawfully implied.

723
00:33:37,223 --> 00:33:38,390
That's it.
Did we get it?

724
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:40,934
Saving and...
Wait for it.

725
00:33:41,477 --> 00:33:42,352
Done.

726
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:50,986
What?

727
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:53,864
Your mind. It's just...
It's amazing.

728
00:33:55,491 --> 00:33:56,742
Thanks.

729
00:33:58,077 --> 00:33:59,161
What?

730
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:01,079
Your mind's amazing, too.

731
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:04,291
Oh. Thank you.
Thank you.

732
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:07,753
Who are you calling
this late?

733
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:09,796
Oh. She's waiting up
for you?

734
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:11,923
Yeah, I guess you're right.
It's pretty late.

735
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:13,258
She's probably
sleeping by now.

736
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:14,843
- Yeah.
- I'll just text her.

737
00:34:15,178 --> 00:34:17,763
It's tough to have a relationship
with a first year.

738
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:20,474
Or any year.
You just don't have a life.

739
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:22,893
How did you
make it work?

740
00:34:23,352 --> 00:34:26,730
Who said I did? It's... It's impossible
to have anything long term

741
00:34:26,856 --> 00:34:29,274
unless you find someone that has the
same 80 hour work week.

742
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:33,570
And then, that doesn't work either,
because they're busy, too.

743
00:34:33,696 --> 00:34:36,281
Yeah. Well, I'm not going to let that be
the reason that Jenny and I don't...

744
00:34:49,378 --> 00:34:51,046
What are you two
still doing here?

745
00:34:51,172 --> 00:34:52,798
- Uh, it's for Harvey.
- Nothing.

746
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:54,382
- Uh, but we're done.
- Goodnight.

747
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:55,342
- Yeah. I'll see you later.
- Goodnight.

748
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:56,885
- Bye.
- Bye.

749
00:35:02,058 --> 00:35:05,894
I'm sure you're aware of this, but, um,
I'm just going to remind you, anyway.

750
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:08,855
Um, this office frowns
upon relationships in the workplace.

751
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:12,067
Yeah.

752
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:35,799
- Watch it.
- Oh, God. I'm so sorry.

753
00:35:36,717 --> 00:35:38,135
It's okay.

754
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:39,636
Um...

755
00:35:39,762 --> 00:35:41,680
Hey, uh, thank you
for last night.

756
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:43,974
The typing.

757
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,809
- Of course. Right.
- Yeah.

758
00:35:45,935 --> 00:35:46,977
- Absolutely.
- It was really helpful.

759
00:35:47,103 --> 00:35:48,186
Mmm-hmm.

760
00:35:49,897 --> 00:35:52,983
Um, hold on one second. Sorry.
Hello?

761
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:54,985
I said I needed you
in my office.

762
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:56,611
- And I said I was on my way.
- Save it.

763
00:35:56,737 --> 00:35:58,905
- Those the files?
- Yes. Take them, please.

764
00:35:59,031 --> 00:36:01,324
Stan is in my office. Meet us in
the conference room.

765
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:02,909
Okay.

766
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,914
Sorry to keep you waiting.

767
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:08,915
That's okay.

768
00:36:09,041 --> 00:36:11,710
I got your email with the list of
other law firms.

769
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:14,880
I respect your effort to make amends
by referring new clients.

770
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:16,923
Oh, that wasn't
a list for client referrals.

771
00:36:17,049 --> 00:36:19,217
Those were firms you should consider
for representation.

772
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:20,969
We're no longer
your attorneys, Tori.

773
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:22,137
What?

774
00:36:22,263 --> 00:36:23,263
We have no choice, really.

775
00:36:23,389 --> 00:36:24,890
It would be impossible
to represent you

776
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:27,309
when we plan on suing you
for every penny you've got.

777
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:29,227
Is this a joke?

778
00:36:29,645 --> 00:36:34,858
Aberdeen Solutions. Created in June of
2006, sold to Dreibach in 2010,

779
00:36:34,984 --> 00:36:36,109
dissolved two days ago.

780
00:36:36,235 --> 00:36:38,278
Before that,
it was Bolton Finances.

781
00:36:38,404 --> 00:36:41,781
And before that,
it was Norton Services, Littleton LLC...

782
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:43,575
- Where did you get those?
- We know what you did, Tori.

783
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:45,410
You couldn't have
subpoenaed these files.

784
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:46,745
And yet, we have them.

785
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:48,288
Take a look.
They're all there.

786
00:36:48,414 --> 00:36:49,289
And now, we have proof.

787
00:36:49,415 --> 00:36:53,043
Proof of what? Those are all legitimate
corporations used for...

788
00:36:53,169 --> 00:36:55,337
Stealing money and
lining your own pockets.

789
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:56,838
But don't take
my word for it.

790
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:58,340
Guys?

791
00:37:04,805 --> 00:37:05,972
Hello, Tori.

792
00:37:06,098 --> 00:37:07,224
Yeah, we hired Stan

793
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:09,476
to do a little
independent consulting on our behalf.

794
00:37:09,602 --> 00:37:11,645
And he's come up with
some very interesting connections.

795
00:37:12,146 --> 00:37:14,648
It was easy.
Even if I don't really have a degree.

796
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:18,151
There was that vacation
you invited me on last year,

797
00:37:18,819 --> 00:37:20,862
to your new house
in the Bahamas.

798
00:37:20,988 --> 00:37:24,241
A house you bought
with money you stole from this firm.

799
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:25,492
My firm.

800
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:28,495
- Jessica...
- Jessica, what?

801
00:37:29,038 --> 00:37:30,538
You can't use any of this.

802
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:32,749
We have
attorney-client privilege.

803
00:37:32,875 --> 00:37:34,376
With Dreibach
Accounting, yes.

804
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:36,461
With the
shelf companies? No.

805
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:39,798
And unfortunately for you,
you're listed on the shelf companies.

806
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:41,883
You stole from me.

807
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:43,969
You either
come clean now,

808
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:46,930
or the only time you'll see your
children in the next decade

809
00:37:47,056 --> 00:37:49,057
will be during
prison visiting hours.

810
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:56,273
So, I'm going to get
my job back now, right?

811
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:57,816
I don't see why not.

812
00:37:57,942 --> 00:37:59,067
No, Stan, you're not.

813
00:38:00,695 --> 00:38:01,569
What?

814
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:04,030
Dreibach's going bankrupt
after this all shakes out.

815
00:38:04,156 --> 00:38:06,116
Even if they don't, they're not going
to hire you back.

816
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:08,034
Why?

817
00:38:09,495 --> 00:38:11,329
Because you falsified
your resume.

818
00:38:15,084 --> 00:38:16,334
What am I
supposed to do now?

819
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:19,087
Well, we just got you more
than your severance package.

820
00:38:19,213 --> 00:38:23,341
I suggest you use it to tide yourself
over until you figure something out.

821
00:38:36,105 --> 00:38:37,439
Stan.

822
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:41,151
Hey. Your best asset
is your mind.

823
00:38:41,277 --> 00:38:43,028
They can't take that
from you.

824
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:45,613
One little mistake.

825
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:49,409
You could go back to school,
become legitimate.

826
00:38:50,077 --> 00:38:51,202
Start over?

827
00:38:56,459 --> 00:38:58,043
I never should have
done it.

828
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:22,567
I told you
they wouldn't catch me.

829
00:39:23,152 --> 00:39:25,862
What are you looking for, Harvey?
Positive reinforcement?

830
00:39:25,988 --> 00:39:28,531
Nothing major.
A trophy. Nobel.

831
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:31,201
Would your likeness in bronze
in the lobby be okay?

832
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:33,203
Bust or life-size?

833
00:39:34,413 --> 00:39:35,789
You did
a good thing, Harvey.

834
00:39:36,749 --> 00:39:38,500
But it wasn't just me,
you know.

835
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:41,002
Well, then, I guess
I should give the kid

836
00:39:41,128 --> 00:39:43,505
the benefit of the doubt
from now on.

837
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:45,548
You should.

838
00:40:01,357 --> 00:40:03,650
Well, you'll be happy to know
that Stan has no idea

839
00:40:03,776 --> 00:40:05,110
what he's going to do
with the rest of his life.

840
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:06,444
That doesn't
make me happy.

841
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:11,950
What if I tell you I have no idea
what I'm doing with mine?

842
00:40:15,037 --> 00:40:18,081
What the hell are we going to do when
I get caught, Harvey?

843
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:20,458
- You're not going to get caught.
- That's your answer?

844
00:40:23,754 --> 00:40:25,171
What else is there?

845
00:40:28,717 --> 00:40:29,884
Why?

846
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:31,845
What?

847
00:40:31,971 --> 00:40:33,930
Hire me. Why would you
do that to me?

848
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:36,558
- You mean for you.
- No. I don't.

849
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:39,018
You've made it perfectly clear that you
only do things for yourself.

850
00:40:39,145 --> 00:40:40,186
So, why?

851
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:42,856
You mean the reason
why I became a lawyer?

852
00:40:42,982 --> 00:40:45,608
Or your friend dealt drugs?
Or you used to cheat?

853
00:40:45,734 --> 00:40:46,776
I cheated because
I need to...

854
00:40:46,902 --> 00:40:48,945
You couldn't make money
any other way? Bullshit.

855
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:52,282
Life is this.

856
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:55,034
I like this.

857
00:40:55,911 --> 00:40:57,412
That's not me.

858
00:40:57,538 --> 00:40:59,456
Well, if it wasn't me,
you wouldn't be here.

859
00:40:59,582 --> 00:41:02,834
So, if you want this to stop,
all you gotta do is tap out.

860
00:41:17,224 --> 00:41:18,433
- Hello.
- Oh.

861
00:41:18,726 --> 00:41:19,934
You're here to see Mike.

862
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:21,811
We're going to
celebrate his victory.

863
00:41:21,937 --> 00:41:23,021
Ah.

864
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:27,567
You know, I actually think
that it's a really,

865
00:41:27,693 --> 00:41:29,277
really good idea that you've come
to pick him up.

866
00:41:29,695 --> 00:41:32,489
In fact, if I were you, I'd do it
a little more often.

867
00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:35,200
Just all those late nights
working with Rachel...

868
00:41:36,911 --> 00:41:38,077
What do you mean?

869
00:41:38,204 --> 00:41:40,413
What do I...
Oh, come on.

870
00:41:40,539 --> 00:41:42,123
You're a smart girl.

871
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:43,958
You understand
animal behavior.

872
00:41:45,002 --> 00:41:46,503
I think you can
figure it out.

873
00:41:50,966 --> 00:41:52,467
Hey. You ready?

874
00:41:52,593 --> 00:41:53,760
Yeah.
