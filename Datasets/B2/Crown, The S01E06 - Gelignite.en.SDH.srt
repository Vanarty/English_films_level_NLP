1
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,400
[fanfare plays]

2
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:39,960
[man] <i>More than half a million people</i>
<i>pack Epsom to bursting point.</i>

3
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:44,320
<i>And now, to watch the coronation derby</i>
<i>comes Her Majesty The Queen.</i>

4
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,520
<i>Her car bearing the royal standard</i>

5
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:49,600
<i>moves slowly down the course</i>
<i>from Tatnum Corner.</i>

6
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,600
<i>Accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh,</i>

7
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,680
<i>the Queen waves acknowledgement</i>
<i>to the welcoming cheers.</i>

8
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:58,400
<i>The crowds pour their appreciation</i>
<i>for the dashing handsome couple,</i>

9
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,000
<i>a symbol of a new era.</i>

10
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,400
[Townsend] Half a million people.

11
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,520
At a racecourse.

12
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:18,240
Thanks to the coronation, your sister
is now the most famous woman in the world.

13
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:20,800
Yes.

14
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,720
But I'm the luckiest.

15
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:32,680
-And on our romantic trip to Rhodesia...
-Official duty in Rhodesia.

16
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:36,240
-With the man I love.
-Secretly love.

17
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,320
I will be the happiest.

18
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:54,400
I've got a story, chief. It's important.

19
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:57,200
As long as it's not about
the Royal family, Bill, I'm all ears.

20
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,120
It is about the Royal family, chief.

21
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,560
Let me guess, how thanks
to one beautiful young woman,

22
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,600
one short televised ceremony...

23
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,880
Oh, thank you, Bob.

24
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,280
A tired anachronistic institution
has rejuvenated,

25
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:14,520
a nation is liberated from the austerity
of rationing and war,

26
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,080
our place as a leading power
in the world has re-established

27
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:20,120
when it seemed to be slipping.
What a load of bollocks.

28
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,800
-Snifter?
-I shouldn't.

29
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:24,560
-Oh, go on. It's nearly lunchtime.
-Papers, sir.

30
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,000
-Thanks, Mary.
-My job.

31
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,760
-It's Princess Margaret.
-What about her?

32
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,880
Leaving the Abbey
on the day of the coronation,

33
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:34,360
I saw her picking a piece of fluff
off a man's uniform.

34
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,360
-Fluff?
-Yes. Fluff.

35
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,800
Jesus, Bill, I thought
we did serious reporting here.

36
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,120
This is serious

37
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,280
because the man in question,
her father's former equerry,

38
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,840
Group Captain Peter Townsend,
is a commoner,

39
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:50,080
and wait for it, a divorced commoner.

40
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,520
Historically,
when this lot brush up against divorce

41
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,440
you end up with either
reformation or abdication.

42
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:59,720
Will church and state clash again?
It's a big story.

43
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,600
So are comet jet planes
dropping out of the sky,

44
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:06,360
Stalin's death ushering
in a power reshuffle in the Soviet Union.

45
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:09,720
Let me write it up, chief.
I've got a feeling about this one.

46
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,880
Based on what?

47
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,520
What are you doing, man?

48
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:21,680
Picking fluff off a man's jacket
that's a gesture as intimate as a kiss,

49
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,920
more intimate, since it suggests
the kiss has already happened.

50
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,800
No. I'm sorry, Bill. I can't hold
the front page for a bit of fluff.

51
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:32,600
Let me write it, chief. Then you decide.

52
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,720
All right.

53
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,280
Make sure it's peppery.

54
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,960
-Make sure it pops.
-Yes, sir!

55
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,560
[phone rings]

56
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,400
Switchboard.
Good morning, Your Royal Highness.

57
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:13,080
Good morning. I would like
to speak to my sister, please.

58
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,360
<i>One moment, please.</i>

59
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:23,000
-<i>London.</i>
-Buckingham Palace, please.

60
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:27,040
-<i>Victoria 48, 32.</i>
-Hold the line.

61
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,000
<i>Buckingham Palace, good morning.</i>

62
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,320
Go ahead, please.

63
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:34,680
<i>I have Her Royal Highness</i>
<i>the Princess Margaret for Her Majesty.</i>

64
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,000
-Certainly, sir.
-Thank you.

65
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,200
Can you hold the line?

66
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:43,120
-Sir, Princess Margaret for Her Majesty.
-Thank you.

67
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:06,720
Hello?

68
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,360
I have Her Royal Highness
the Princess Margaret for Her Majesty.

69
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,320
Yes, sir, breakfast room.

70
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,960
-Breakfast room
-Yes, sir.

71
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,400
Telephone call for you, ma'am.

72
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,360
<i>Yes?</i>

73
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:27,880
Her Royal Highness the Princess Margaret,
Your Majesty.

74
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:28,800
Thank you.

75
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:34,240
-<i>Hello, you.</i>
-Hello, you.

76
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,400
So, I was wondering
if you had a free evening soon

77
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,280
where we all might have dinner together.

78
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:41,040
-Before I go to Rhodesia.
-<i>I'm sure I do.</i>

79
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,680
-Thursday? Mummy's out.
-I'd have to check.

80
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:47,280
-<i>Lovely.</i>
-And, who's "us all"?

81
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:52,520
You, and me, and Philip and...

82
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,960
And I'd like to bring Peter if I may.

83
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,760
-What, Peter-Peter?
-Yes, Peter.

84
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,280
<i>Oh.</i>

85
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:05,360
-What does that mean, oh?
-Nothing. Oh, how nice.

86
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:08,200
There's something
we'd like to discuss with you.

87
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:11,200
-Oh?
-There you go again.

88
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:15,960
-<i>Sorry. Am I going to be given a clue?</i>
-No.

89
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,840
Oh.

90
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,680
-<i>Stop it.</i>
-Sorry.

91
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:23,440
-<i>So Thursday evening, then? You'll check?</i>
-Fine.

92
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,160
It will be such fun.

93
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,680
<i>Lovely.</i>

94
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:37,840
Lovely.

95
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,480
Oh.

96
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,600
Here we are.

97
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:57,080
-Sir.
-Lovely, thank you.

98
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,640
Sir.

99
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:18,000
-What's your name then, my darling?
-Thank you, gentlemen, thank you.

100
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,880
Thank you very much, gentlemen,
thank you.

101
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,720
You're too kind, you're too kind.

102
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,880
A special guest joins us this afternoon,

103
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:29,880
who's just returned from a year
in post-revolutionary Cairo

104
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,320
working as a photojournalist.

105
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,920
Our fellow lunch club member,
Tony Longdon.

106
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,960
All-Night-Longdon.

107
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:38,160
[laughter and applause]

108
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,720
Thank you, chaps,
it's very nice to be back, I must say.

109
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,640
Ladies, might we close the shutters,
please?

110
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,640
[rowdy cheering]

111
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,920
Lovely!

112
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,880
I am, as Baron says,
fresh from the streets of Cairo,

113
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,200
and I'm still trying to digest
the hurricane of popular uprising,

114
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:02,440
violent military coup and revolution
that I have just witnessed.

115
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,000
[man] Bloody natives.

116
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,320
You all know King Farouk.
Colourful character.

117
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:11,800
-He owned more than a hundred cars.
-[man] Almost as much as me.

118
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,400
-Had them all painted red.
-Splendid.

119
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,440
He used to race them
through streets of Cairo,

120
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:19,200
shooting at any pedestrians
who happen to get in his way.

121
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,680
-Hear, hear.
-Peasant shoot!

122
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,240
[laughter]

123
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:26,240
Probably why he was forced
to abdicate last year.

124
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:32,800
And now, this man, Nasser,
is the name on everyone's lips.

125
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,600
He has the charisma to unite
not just his own country,

126
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,440
but the entire Arab world.

127
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,560
Stirring up anti-Western,
anti-monarchical sentiment.

128
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,480
This is Shepheard's.

129
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:53,800
A famous British hotel.
A symbol of colonial rule.

130
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,040
Before riots...

131
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,960
-[man] God.
-...and after.

132
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,720
That writing. What does it say?

133
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,360
"Death to the Imperialists."

134
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,680
However, it's not all doom and gloom.

135
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,120
Mike, got something
a little special for you here.

136
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,400
[cheering]

137
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,320
[Mike] Now, that's what
I'm talking about.

138
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,680
[applause and whistling]

139
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:46,240
-Give him a tip.
-Don't tell my wife.

140
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,800
[laughs]

141
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,200
Good tip.

142
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,560
-Where were you today?
-Nowhere.

143
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,680
Well, clearly somewhere.
But nowhere that would interest you.

144
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,000
It's a lunch club.

145
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:04,640
-Where?
-Soho.

146
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,560
Oh.

147
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,720
With just men.

148
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,680
Talking about women.

149
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:17,560
No.
Talking about Egypt if you must know.

150
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,840
And the revolution
that's just taken place there.

151
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:25,560
Along with the unrest in Croatia, Albania,
Montenegro, Yugoslavia, Hungary, Italy.

152
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,480
Please take note.

153
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:33,200
Yes, a little bit about the fairer sex
over coffee and the odd brandy.

154
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,480
What do you expect?
It's a gentlemen's lunch club.

155
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,600
-So, what's the guest list for tonight?
-No one.

156
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:55,360
-Just you, me, Margaret and, oh, Peter.
-What? Townsend Peter?

157
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,480
-Why on earth did we have to dress up?
-She insisted.

158
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,640
She wanted to make it a special occasion.

159
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,400
With him?
Isn't that a contradiction in terms?

160
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,000
He's not been a naughty boy, has he?

161
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,720
I know as much as you do.

162
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,040
It will be fine.

163
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,240
Come on.

164
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,520
-We'd like to be left alone now.
-Yes, ma'am.

165
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,360
Just leave it.

166
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,720
Thank you.

167
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:08,920
Excuse me.

168
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,000
I asked you here tonight because...

169
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:20,000
there is something
I wanted to discuss with you.

170
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,680
I think you already know
that over the years

171
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,520
with Peter
being so much part of our family,

172
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:30,320
and away from his own so much,
a friendship has developed between us.

173
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,640
And then, ever since Papa's death
hitting me so hard,

174
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:43,200
and with your succession and coronation
and you being more and more occupied,

175
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:48,120
Peter has become almost
my sole companion, and I his.

176
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:53,520
And so when his divorce came through
in December last year,

177
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,640
I suppose it was only natural
that we both started thinking about

178
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,760
what kind of...

179
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:03,560
future we might have together

180
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,680
and we have reached a decision in April,
wasn't it?

181
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,440
Just before the coronation...

182
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,360
that one day...

183
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,360
we wanted to...

184
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,120
Well, you know...

185
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:28,720
-Marry?
-Yes. [laughs]

186
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:29,920
[Queen Elizabeth] Goodness.

187
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,920
Well, of course, we're aware
of the complications and issues at stake.

188
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,160
Oh, Lilibet, you've known for a while
about Peter and I.

189
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:50,240
This can't really be
a terrible shock to you.

190
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,160
No, not at all.

191
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,840
It's wonderful.

192
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:01,360
-Is there anything you'd like to ask us?
-Does your wife know?

193
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,560
-No, ex-wife.
-She does. We had a frank conversation.

194
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:07,160
-There is no animosity.
-Oh, good.

195
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:10,840
-And the boys?
-They know and seem very happy.

196
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,600
So...

197
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,480
do I have your permission?

198
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,680
As Sovereign?

199
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,400
Oh.

200
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,440
Well...

201
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,320
Of course, I'll have to take advice...

202
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,760
on the how's and where's and...

203
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:48,040
all official matters,
but if it's what you desire...

204
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,320
More than anything in the world.

205
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,120
Then as your sister,
I'm never going to oppose it.

206
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:00,360
Oh, thank you. Thank you.

207
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:05,480
Thank you. I'm so happy. I'm so happy.

208
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:09,840
Oh, well. Congratulations, both of you.

209
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,520
Thank you, sir.

210
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,560
I suppose it had better be "Philip"
from now on.

211
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,240
Thank you, sir. Oh, Philip.

212
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,960
[Philip] <i>You knew?</i>

213
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,080
Not the extent of it.

214
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,080
But you didn't think to mention it?

215
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,280
I don't like it. Any of it.

216
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,160
For one thing,
it will create the most enormous scandal.

217
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,320
Nor do I believe in them as a couple.
He's too old for her.

218
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:48,400
And he had some sort of "breakdown"
during the war.

219
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,120
Now that's all in the past.

220
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:53,280
Besides, that's why he got on
with my father so well.

221
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,520
-Not to mention the fact he's dull.
-He's not dull.

222
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:00,680
Desperately dull. I'm confident
I've met more interesting plants.

223
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:03,880
Not to mention
it's a terrible thing to do to you.

224
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,280
Why?

225
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:10,000
Because of the position it puts you in
as a sister and as a Queen.

226
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:13,920
Has everyone forgotten the catastrophe
that was your uncle already?

227
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,560
-The situation's different.
-One party divorced? The other Royal?

228
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,480
Sounds pretty similar to me.

229
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:25,040
That was 17 years ago.
The world has changed.

230
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:29,080
The rest of the world has.
Nothing changes in the Court of St. James.

231
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:33,320
Besides, we have a son and heir.

232
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:36,360
There's no realistic prospect
of Margaret becoming queen.

233
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:40,360
And one can see the attraction.

234
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:49,200
-In Peter?
-Yes. He's a handsome war hero.

235
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:53,240
-Divorced war hero.
-And blameless in that divorce.

236
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:56,640
No. There's no such thing
as a blameless party in a divorce.

237
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,520
His wife had an affair with another man.

238
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:03,880
Because he was always around here,
sniffing around your sister.

239
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:07,320
-He was looking after my father.
-And sniffing around your sister.

240
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,560
Stop it.

241
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:12,880
Anyway, I thought you liked him.

242
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:18,240
Liked him? I mean, I respect him
for what he did in the war, certainly.

243
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,720
He plays bridge well.
And he's a good pilot.

244
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,080
-And he's a good influence on Margaret.
-Is he?

245
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,920
If he were a good influence
he'd patch things up with his wife,

246
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,520
and leave Margaret well alone.

247
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:49,240
-Night, Bill.
-Goodnight.

248
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,920
Potentially...

249
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,760
-Goodnight, sir.
-Yeah.

250
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,720
This had better be good.

251
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,200
It is.

252
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:24,640
-Bloody hell.
-You did say peppery.

253
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:28,880
-Pepper is one thing. This is gelignite.
-I know.

254
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:39,000
-What are you doing?
-I can't run this without going upstairs.

255
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,120
-What?
-Don't look at me like that.

256
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,480
Live in the real bloody world
for a moment, will you?

257
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:50,760
Margery, hello, yes. Is he there?
Yeah, just for a few minutes.

258
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:57,560
This is not just inflammatory,
it breaks all the rules.

259
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,680
What rules, sir?

260
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:02,120
The unspoken rules
of deference and respect

261
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,120
shown by the media to the Royal family.

262
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,680
But surely those rules changed

263
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,520
the moment they invited television
into the coronation.

264
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:11,040
That was their right,
and a huge concession.

265
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,200
-To what?
-Popular interest.

266
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,240
Their interest also.

267
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,760
Look at their standing now,
it's never been higher.

268
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:21,680
The question we in the fourth estate
need to be asking ourselves is,

269
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:25,320
do we let ourselves be used,
or do we have our own independent voice?

270
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,240
Don't get moralistic with me.

271
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:30,760
If we don't break this story,
do you think nobody else will?

272
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:33,600
I know there's plenty of others
sniffing around it, sir.

273
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,240
Oh, thank you for letting me know.

274
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:45,440
Of course, Tommy,
thank you for understanding.

275
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,680
-I'm sorry.
-No, I'm sorry.

276
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,160
I imagine it must be difficult

277
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,000
being dictated to like that
by an employee.

278
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:56,000
-I wasn't dictated to.
-Am I missing something?

279
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,520
You said this editor was telling you

280
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,720
what he was going to print
in your newspaper.

281
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:03,680
He is. But I can't keep telling him
what to write.

282
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,480
I thought that was the point
of owning a newspaper.

283
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,640
Look, I'm just trying to help you, Tommy.

284
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,840
I suggest you see this
for the kind gesture that it is.

285
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:14,560
What?
That you are about to print an article

286
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,080
that will cause deep distress
to senior, let's be quite clear,

287
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,200
the most senior members
of the Royal family?

288
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:23,800
That I'm warning you.
That I'm giving you the heads up.

289
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:27,280
I'm on my knees with gratitude.

290
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:41,240
[Infernal Galop
from Orpheus in the Underworld plays]

291
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:49,720
[chattering]

292
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,320
[laughter]

293
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,520
Stop.

294
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:21,760
Can you shut that?

295
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:45,960
Your Majesty.

296
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:49,960
A story is about to break in the press

297
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:55,960
identifying Peter Townsend not just
as the companion of Princess Margaret...

298
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:02,040
but as her likely future husband.

299
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:07,360
We understand that the paper
is to feature a profile

300
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,160
of Group Captain Townsend,

301
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:13,800
details of his marriage
and subsequent divorce,

302
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:18,240
along with an editorial
about other notable divorcees

303
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:21,880
to have been associated
with members of the Royal family.

304
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,480
Should we deny it all?

305
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:38,440
With respect, ma'am,
it's a little late for that.

306
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:41,600
This horse has already bolted.

307
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,160
[knock on door]

308
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,520
Your Royal Highness?

309
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,120
Her Majesty the Queen for you,
Your Royal Highness.

310
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,280
On the telephone.

311
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:16,680
-Hello.
-Hello, you. Bad time, good time?

312
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:20,560
<i>Good time. Always.</i>

313
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:24,080
Look, I've been wracking my brain
about how I can best help you.

314
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,840
Now, you know that the Church of England

315
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:28,280
doesn't permit the remarriage
of divorced persons

316
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:31,120
if the husband or wife
of the former marriage is still alive.

317
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,040
Yes.

318
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:35,640
Well, I was just wondering,
if you and Peter had considered Scotland?

319
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:38,560
-<i>To live?</i>
-No, for the wedding.

320
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,600
Why?
Because it would be more low profile?

321
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:45,240
Well, actually,
I was thinking of legal reasons.

322
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:48,040
Marriage isn't regarded as a sacrament
in the Church of Scotland.

323
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,640
It is not as binding
in the same way as here.

324
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:56,000
Meaning, meaning we could
even get married in a church?

325
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,640
<i>Well, I'd have to check, but I think so.</i>

326
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,800
[Margaret] That would be so lovely.

327
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:07,600
-Lilibet, thank you so much.
-<i>It would make my life a lot easier too.</i>

328
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,600
-Sorry, Lilibet.
-What for?

329
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:18,600
<i>I think you're going to get a visit</i>
<i>from Mummy about all this.</i>

330
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:19,720
Oh.

331
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:23,480
I realize I'm not making
anyone's life easy.

332
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,600
Yours especially.

333
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:31,320
But I'm determined to do this for you.
To give you what you want.

334
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,000
Thank you.

335
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:38,720
-<i>I can't wait to tell Peter.</i>
-I'd better go.

336
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,880
-Tommy.
-Your Majesty.

337
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:18,320
Mummy. This is a surprise.

338
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,200
I am a mother of two daughters
whom I love equally.

339
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:30,000
It seems that they each have problems
of equal size.

340
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:36,040
Obviously, we want Margaret to be happy,
to have the man she wants.

341
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:37,200
Yes.

342
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:43,600
But we must do everything in our power
to protect you as Queen.

343
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:47,120
-And as a sister.
-Protect me from what?

344
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,280
I've given Margaret my word
and I'm determined to support her.

345
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:54,360
They can marry in Scotland,
where I'm not head of the church.

346
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:59,000
Your Majesty,
I fear the matter is more intricate.

347
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,040
Let's be quite clear.

348
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:03,280
If Margaret were to marry Peter,
it would be a scandal.

349
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:09,040
Don't mistake your current popularity
for long-term security.

350
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:15,040
Your uncle's affair and abdication
almost destroyed the monarchy.

351
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,480
This could too.

352
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,280
Tommy?

353
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:31,240
Ma'am, what do you know
about the Royal Marriages Act of 1772?

354
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,480
-George II?
-Third, ma'am.

355
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:37,720
He had two younger brothers,
William and Henry.

356
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:40,240
Both of whom, I'm assuming,
made undesirable marriages.

357
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:44,800
One to an illegitimate shrew,
the other to a disreputable jade,

358
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:48,040
which caused an outrage
in parliament and the church.

359
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:52,280
Now in response, George III
asked his Prime Minister, Lord North,

360
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:57,040
to rush through a Royal Marriages Act
to prevent any future wilful young prince

361
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:02,120
or princess from making an ill-advised
or disadvantageous match

362
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:05,360
which might threaten the integrity
of the Royal house.

363
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:09,920
It decrees that until the age of 25,
any member of the Royal family

364
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,280
must secure
the sovereign's permission to marry.

365
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:20,000
-But?
-But, not thereafter.

366
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,840
-I see.
-So...

367
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:28,480
If Margaret were to wait
until after her 25th birthday,

368
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:32,560
she would be free to make any decision
she likes without your consent.

369
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,720
The important thing is,

370
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:39,560
it protects your relationship
with both church and government.

371
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:46,680
Well, I can see the advantages of that.
But, what's in it for her?

372
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:50,320
Mummy, she's only 23.
What does she do in the meantime?

373
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:54,400
In the meantime, she and Peter wait.

374
00:28:56,600 --> 00:29:00,480
-Preferably, in separate countries.
-What?

375
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:03,440
It's the only way
to contain the story, ma'am.

376
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,320
Thank you, sir.

377
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,000
-Good morning, sir.
-Out of my way!

378
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:48,360
Come.

379
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,320
-[Elizabeth] Margaret!
-[Margaret] No!

380
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:13,800
Margaret!

381
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:21,400
Just until your 25th birthday.
Then, you would be free to do as you wish.

382
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:25,600
Look me in the eye and tell me.
Is it a posting or is it a banishment?

383
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:29,200
It's a posting. I promise.

384
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:34,240
It's just a way of managing the story,
keeping it off the front pages.

385
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:38,200
-Not a heartless attempt to split us up?
-No, of course not.

386
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:40,360
Papa did the same for Philip and me.
He made us wait.

387
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:42,320
For three months. This is for two years.

388
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:45,480
Think of it. Two years.

389
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,600
Why did you even dangle Scotland
under my nose?

390
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:00,960
Sorry.

391
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:25,800
All right.

392
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:33,240
If I do this for you, will you promise me
that this banishment...

393
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:34,760
Posting.

394
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:36,640
This banishment won't start
until after our trip to Rhodesia?

395
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,840
You know how much
we've been looking forward to it.

396
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:46,920
You're going to deny us that as well?

397
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,880
It's the sensitivity of you two together.

398
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:53,320
The photographers.
It would overshadow everything.

399
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:58,560
But when you get back,
you'll have some time together.

400
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,720
Alone.

401
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,680
I promise you that.

402
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:44,240
[Townsend] They offered me Johannesburg.
I refused.

403
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,560
Then Singapore...

404
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,520
I refused that too.

405
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,560
Then they came back with Brussels.

406
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,280
It's dreary, but at least it's close.

407
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:00,760
The whole thing feels like
a completely unnecessary,

408
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:02,560
unjustifiable punishment.

409
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:03,600
I know.

410
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,240
Perhaps your sister sensed that.

411
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,880
That is why she's asked me
to go to Northern Ireland.

412
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,160
What for?

413
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:15,680
To accompany her
on her trip to Belfast this week. To...

414
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:21,720
-put on a show of public approval.
-That's something, I suppose.

415
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,400
No substitute for Rhodesia, though.

416
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,200
No one wanted Philip.

417
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:40,960
She dug her heels in,
got the man she wanted, didn't she?

418
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:43,560
She did.

419
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,680
We ought to head back.

420
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:55,600
-Come on.
-No, wait. Kiss me.

421
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:08,080
You know we won't be able to
back at the house.

422
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:42,000
-Your Majesty.
-Tommy.

423
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,560
Just to run through
the order of the day.

424
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:47,240
-Yes.
-We'll be met at the airport

425
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:49,800
by the Governor of Northern Ireland,
Lord Wakehurst.

426
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:53,520
From there, we will be going
to the Belfast City Boundary

427
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:56,280
to be met by the Lieutenant
of the City of Belfast.

428
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:59,480
After that,
we will be presented to the Lord Mayor,

429
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:04,400
Alderman Percival Brown,
and the Town Clerk, John Dunlop.

430
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:07,400
Followed by a city luncheon at Civic Hall.

431
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,640
The other way around, I think.

432
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:15,320
-Ma'am?
-A civic luncheon at City Hall.

433
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:22,560
-Forgive me.
-Is everything all right?

434
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:30,840
I do hope it wasn't a mistake
inviting the group captain to join us.

435
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:34,760
You've never cared for him, Tommy.

436
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:38,680
No, I cared for him as long as
he did his job and knew his place.

437
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,480
My father held him in high regard.

438
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:44,960
As a member of staff,
not as a member of the family.

439
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:49,320
He has been a good friend to us all.

440
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:53,040
Too good, I would argue.
And he let his wife go in the process.

441
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:56,280
He was innocent in that regard.

442
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:58,280
She left of her own accord.

443
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:01,440
And he's a wonderful father
to those boys.

444
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:04,600
I'm just trying to manage
a difficult situation, ma'am.

445
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:06,800
As am I.

446
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:09,120
Sending him away
will break my sister's heart.

447
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:11,720
Hearts mend.

448
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,600
Was there anything else?

449
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,400
-No.
-Your Majesty.

450
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,720
[cheering]

451
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:02,200
[man] <i>...bringing Her Majesty the Queen</i>
<i>on a visit to Northern Ireland.</i>

452
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:08,600
<i>Her Majesty now walks</i>
<i>towards three-year-old Eileen Hall,</i>

453
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:10,480
<i>who presents her with a bouquet.</i>

454
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:14,880
<i>The Queen, who wears a coat of vivid</i>
<i>blue shantung with a matching hat,</i>

455
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:17,920
<i>finds herself sharing the limelight</i>
<i>with Group Captain Townsend,</i>

456
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,920
<i>who accompanies her on the tour.</i>

457
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,920
<i>The crowd get a last glimpse</i>
<i>of the Queen and her husband</i>

458
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,880
<i>before they begin the drive to City Hall.</i>

459
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:29,240
<i>En route, thousands pack the streets</i>
<i>to bid them welcome.</i>

460
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:36,200
<i>The Royal couple are welcomed</i>
<i>onto Balmoral Showground,</i>

461
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:39,360
<i>where 4,000 ex-servicemen and women</i>

462
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,280
<i>to pay tribute to their sovereign.</i>

463
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:44,240
<i>Many Ulster schools</i>

464
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:47,320
<i>and they all have a smile</i>
<i>and a wave for the Queen.</i>

465
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:53,080
<i>As London papers called once more today</i>
<i>for a statement from Buckingham Palace</i>

466
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:56,080
<i>to clarify the rumours of a romance</i>
<i>between Princess Margaret</i>

467
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,600
<i>and Group Captain Townsend,</i>

468
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:00,400
<i>newspaper editors from all over the world</i>

469
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:04,080
<i>to scrutinize Townsend's face,</i>

470
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:12,560
<i>The Queen can't be used</i>
<i>to sharing the limelight</i>

471
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,040
<i>with a member of her household.</i>

472
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:16,200
<i>But the gathered crowds</i>
<i>certainly seem as interested</i>

473
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:19,280
<i>in Group Captain Townsend</i>
<i>as in Her Majesty.</i>

474
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:25,600
-Turn it off.
-Certainly, ma'am.

475
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:28,680
<i>The crowds had to jostle with members</i>
<i>of the press and television</i>

476
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:30,520
<i>for following</i>
<i>the Royal party's every move.</i>

477
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:37,800
I brought him along to show my gratitude
for his years of service

478
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,800
and to support my sister.

479
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:44,880
And I had hoped that attention
on Margaret and Peter would fade away.

480
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:47,200
But I could barely hear myself
speak today.

481
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:51,040
-The solution is an obvious one.
-Which is?

482
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:55,600
Bring forward the group captain's
relocation with immediate effect.

483
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:59,920
But that would mean him missing
his reunion with my sister in London?

484
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,400
And I gave her my word.

485
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:06,120
Well, sometimes best intentions
need to be reconsidered, Your Majesty.

486
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:08,000
You can always blame it on me.

487
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:15,400
No. Let's wait 24 hours.
Things might calm down tomorrow.

488
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,560
-Your Majesty.
-Your Majesty.

489
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:21,320
The Lambeg drummers, ma'am.
A special Orangemen's welcome.

490
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,760
Townsend? Captain Townsend?

491
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:48,560
-Townsend.
-Captain.

492
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,640
[happy screaming]

493
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:16,560
May God give you wisdom,
loyalty and faithfulness.

494
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:22,120
And may the future bring peace,
contentment and true happiness

495
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,480
to the people of Northern Ireland.

496
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:39,080
-Townsend!
-Townsend!

497
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,480
Townsend!

498
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,600
Do you have a moment, Lilibet?

499
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,720
Yes, of course.

500
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:30,800
I just wanted to apologize
for all the press attention.

501
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:34,920
And to thank you for inviting me along
in the first place.

502
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:39,960
-I do appreciate the gesture.
-It's the least I could do.

503
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:42,440
I regretted having to take you off
the Rhodesia trip.

504
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:44,480
Yes. Margaret and I
were so looking forward to it.

505
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,360
We have so many shared interests,
as you know,

506
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:49,640
we enjoy doing everything together.

507
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:57,520
We had hoped to find some time together
during her days off.

508
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:00,880
Walking, swimming, riding.

509
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:05,440
But not to be.

510
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:09,480
No.

511
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:16,840
Anyway, nice chatting.

512
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:25,200
Ma'am, if you wouldn't mind.

513
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:35,160
Just wondering if Her Majesty
has had time to think about the matter.

514
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:38,320
She has.

515
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:44,720
Take care of it, Tommy.
In whatever manner you see fit.

516
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:48,040
Yes, ma'am.

517
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:03,000
[cheering]

518
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:20,080
-Thank you, Your Majesty.
-Good night, sir.

519
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:23,320
Thank you so much, Peter.

520
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:26,720
Ma'am.

521
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,680
[Lascelles] Group Captain Townsend.

522
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:10,240
The "man of the moment".

523
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:13,960
Do come up.

524
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:24,280
Will you sit?

525
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:38,160
Following consultation
with the government, the Foreign Office,

526
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:40,200
and Her Majesty's press secretary,

527
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:43,160
the decision has been taken
to move forward your posting

528
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:45,040
to Brussels with immediate effect.

529
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:47,720
A car is waiting to take you first
to your apartment,

530
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:50,960
where you will pack,
and then directly to the airfield.

531
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:54,440
The plane for Brussels
leaves in just under three hours.

532
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:57,080
There was some concern
that that might not give you enough time,

533
00:44:57,160 --> 00:45:00,280
but I felt sure that as a military man
packing quickly

534
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:04,120
and unsentimentally
would come as second nature to you.

535
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:08,920
But that isn't what was agreed.

536
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,680
The agreement between
Margaret and Her Majesty the Queen,

537
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:17,160
with the certain knowledge
of Her Majesty the Queen Mother,

538
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:20,040
was that Margaret and I
were to spend some time together

539
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:22,240
upon her return from Rhodesia.

540
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:25,560
Before I travelled to Brussels.
Forty-eight hours at least.

541
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:29,600
Your proposal is a direct contravention
of that agreement.

542
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:36,280
Well, I cannot, nor would I ever presume,
to know the intimate details

543
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:40,040
of whatever agreements have
or have not been made within the family.

544
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:44,760
What I can tell you is that the position
of air attaché at the embassy fell vacant

545
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:48,440
unexpectedly early
and needs filling right away.

546
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:53,840
Of course, a crucial position
like the air attaché to the embassy

547
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:56,640
at Brussels
cannot be left vacant for very long.

548
00:45:56,720 --> 00:46:01,360
I ask only that it remain so
until after the Princess returns,

549
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:03,120
as I was promised.

550
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:09,000
I'm afraid that will not be possible.

551
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:21,960
Tommy...

552
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,480
I understand
you're only trying to do your job.

553
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:32,480
But one thing the trip to Northern Ireland
has made very clear to me

554
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:38,680
is that the romance between Margaret
and myself has caught the public eye.

555
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:40,600
There is a momentum for us,

556
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:46,120
a sense of joy and celebration
which you would be wise to acknowledge.

557
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:49,920
The people can clearly see the sincerity
of the love between Margaret and me,

558
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,560
and I would advise you
not to reprehend us for that.

559
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:55,440
Such an act could backfire.

560
00:46:56,520 --> 00:47:02,200
And now, if I may give you
some advice in turn, Peter.

561
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:04,400
That when referring to a member
of the Royal family,

562
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:08,840
you use the appropriate title.
In this case, Her Royal Highness.

563
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:11,640
When referring to the woman I love,
and who loves me,

564
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:15,640
and who is soon to be my wife,
I'll call her what I damn well like.

565
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:17,160
Her name is Margaret.

566
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:22,400
Car, Townsend.

567
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:24,920
Waiting.

568
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:30,840
Tick, tick, tick.

569
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:39,400
Bon voyage.

570
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:53,880
A tiny white community,
surrounded by primitive Africans,

571
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:59,440
grew into a young and flourishing nation

572
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:04,000
with the ever brightening promise
of more prosperity before it.

573
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:42,760
-Hurry up!
-Yes, sir!

574
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:47,120
[Margaret]<i> We honour a man</i>
<i>of remarkable vision,</i>

575
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:51,920

576
00:48:56,840 --> 00:49:01,120
<i>I wish continued prosperity and success</i>

577
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:04,200

Now!

Switchboard.

592
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:15,640
Her Royal Highness needs
to make an urgent call

593
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:16,800
to Her Majesty the Queen.

594
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:19,840
-<i>A secure line will be required.</i>
-Putting you through.

595

Foreign Office.
How may I direct your call?

596
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:26,320
Buckingham Palace. Victoria 48, 32.

<i>I have Her Royal Highness</i>
<i>the Princess Margaret</i>

Sir.

600
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:35,520
Sir.

601
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:39,640
Princess Margaret
for Her Majesty the Queen.

602
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:42,040
-On a secure line.
-Of course!

603
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:43,080
What's taking so long?

604
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:45,280
Well, I gather
we have the secure line, ma'am.

605
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:47,480
They're just having trouble
locating Her Majesty.

606
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:50,520
What can be so difficult? She's the Queen.
She's fairly conspicuous.

607
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:51,760
She can't disappear.

608
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:54,280

609
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:59,040

613
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:23,560
Sandringham House, good evening.

614
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:28,480
Yes, sir. She's here.
Arrived about an hour ago.

615
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:32,400
Yes, sir, right away.

616
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,920
Ma'am, I've located the Queen.

617
00:51:54,760 --> 00:51:56,840
[man] The strip made up for it at Ascot

618
00:51:56,920 --> 00:51:59,840
but we're really trying
not to let this happen again.

619
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:02,080
[Elizabeth] I think
he's a little bit inexperienced.

620
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:04,560
-What, the jockey, ma'am?
-Yes, I do.

621
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:06,800
-[woman] Telephone, Your Majesty.
-Right.

622
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:10,040
Yes, I'd like his scope recorded for
the first quarter mile tomorrow morning.

623
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:11,280
Yes, ma'am.

624
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:15,520
And then we might have to think
about pairing him with another rider.

625
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:16,600
[man] Yes, ma'am.

626
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:18,400
Yes?

627
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:20,560
-How could you?
-Margaret.

628
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:23,880
<i>You gave me your word. Promised me</i>
<i>he'd still be there when I got back.</i>

629
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:25,960
-I did.
-<i>Why has he been sent away?</i>

630
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:30,040
-Banished like some criminal?
-<i>Things got out of hand.</i>

631
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:33,760
I took you at your word.
Believed everything you said.

632
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:37,400
<i>How happy you were for me.</i>
<i>How you would support us.</i>

633
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:38,320
Margaret.

634
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:39,760
<i>You've been against us</i>
<i>from the beginning.</i>

635
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:42,120
-Because you can't bear to be eclipsed.
-<i>What?</i>

636
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:44,960
Can't bear to be outshone
by your younger sister.

637
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:46,720
You've never liked it. Admit it.

638
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:50,400
<i>You've hated how Peter and I</i>
<i>caught the popular imagination.</i>

639
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:52,960
-<i>Hated it enough to want to destroy it.</i>
-This is madness.

640
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:59,120
Well, you fail to protect me.
I will fail to protect you in return.

641
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:00,320
<i>Margaret.</i>

642
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:05,440
You reap what you sow, sister.

[Philip] <i>"The laws of England say</i>
<i>that any man, once divorced,</i>

is fully entitled to marry again.

645
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:57,720
If those laws are good enough
for England,

646
00:53:57,800 --> 00:53:59,600
they are good enough
for the Royal family."

647
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:00,760
I know, but--

648
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:02,760
"The near-holy reverence shown
for the Crown

649
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:05,320
by the people of Britain
is a fact of life,

650
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:06,920
as the recent coronation has shown."

But are those centuries of awe

653
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:21,360
Can that veneration be sustained
in the light of the Royal family's cruelty

00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:23,840
<i>to its very own members?"</i>

655

00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:41,600
and seems to have as deep a hold as ever
on the loyalties of the people.

658
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:45,680
It is not likely, however,
to survive the clear proof

659
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:49,680
that it is insensate and cruel."

661
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:57,440

In 48 hours, it will have passed.

If you're lucky.

665
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:14,000
I fear it will take longer than that
for Margaret to forgive me.

666
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:16,000
She will in time, she has to.

667
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:18,960
We all have to.

668
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:26,800
-Your Majesty.
-Be right with you.

-Hello, Mike. Where are you going?
-I told you. I was away for the weekend.

-Baron's having a house party.

-Who's Baron?
-Baron Nahoum.

President of our Lunch Club.

673
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:42,000
Don't look like that.
It's gentlemen only, right?

674
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:43,360
Absolutely.

675
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:47,800
Perfectly innocent.

-Shall we, old boy?
