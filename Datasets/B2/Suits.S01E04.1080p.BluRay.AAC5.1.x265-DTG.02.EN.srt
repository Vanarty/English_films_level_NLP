1
00:00:04,754 --> 00:00:07,339
Harvard Trivia.
The lightning round.

2
00:00:07,465 --> 00:00:08,632
Go. Pulitzer Prizes.

3
00:00:08,758 --> 00:00:10,426
- Forty six.
- Nobel Peace Prizes.

4
00:00:10,552 --> 00:00:11,677
- Five.
- What is the oldest book

5
00:00:11,803 --> 00:00:13,095
in the Harvard
library collection?

6
00:00:13,221 --> 00:00:14,304
- The Bible.
- Wrong.

7
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:15,639
The Gutenberg Bible.

8
00:00:15,765 --> 00:00:17,266
Everyone knows
it's the Gutenberg Bible.

9
00:00:17,392 --> 00:00:18,559
Yes, but you didn't say it.

10
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:20,686
The rules dictate
you must be precise,

11
00:00:20,812 --> 00:00:23,397
as the law
is a very precise endeavor.

12
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:24,898
- How many U.S. Pres...
- Eight.

13
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:26,567
That's not fair.
You didn't even finish the question.

14
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:27,901
And yet, it's right.

15
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:30,904
The question was going to be, how many
U.S. Presidents have attended Harvard?

16
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:32,781
- You want names?
- No. We get it.

17
00:00:32,907 --> 00:00:36,994
Final round. Ross is ahead by one.
One question each.

18
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:38,495
Points are double.

19
00:00:38,621 --> 00:00:40,414
Double because he wants
to keep you in the game, Seth.

20
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,124
Bring it on, Ross.
I bleed crimson.

21
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:45,711
Oh, venomous banter. This is adorable.
I love it. Ross.

22
00:00:45,837 --> 00:00:47,963
Square pizza.
Where do you get it?

23
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:53,260
Are you kidding?
Any self respecting Harvard alumnus

24
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:54,428
would know
the answer to that.

25
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:57,598
Late night studying,
you want square pizza, where do you go?

26
00:01:00,643 --> 00:01:05,105
You know, I'm more of a burger guy.
I study better on protein.

27
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:09,860
That's pathetic.

28
00:01:09,986 --> 00:01:10,903
- It's Pinocchio's.
- Mmm.

29
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:13,072
I answer mine, I win.

30
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:14,323
Yeah, I know.

31
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:20,537
How many current U.S. Supreme Court
justices are from our alma mater?

32
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:24,374
Five.

33
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:29,630
Got anything to say, Ross?

34
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:32,174
No.
Just that the answer is wrong.

35
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:35,552
Scalia, Roberts, Kennedy,
Breyer, Kagan.

36
00:01:35,678 --> 00:01:37,971
- Ginsburg.
- Ruth Bader Ginsburg went to Columbia.

37
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:41,975
She graduated from Columbia after
she attended Harvard for two years.

38
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:45,229
The question was phrased,
"How many justices were from Harvard?"

39
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:47,189
Well, she was on
the Harvard Law Review.

40
00:01:47,315 --> 00:01:50,442
When she arrived at Columbia
as a transfer, she was from Harvard.

41
00:01:50,568 --> 00:01:53,278
The rules dictate
that you must be precise,

42
00:01:53,404 --> 00:01:56,281
as the law
is a precise endeavor.

43
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:05,249
Congratulations.
That's what you get for second place.

44
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:08,794
To the victor
belongs the spoils.

45
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:13,257
A case. Pro bono.
One of your very own.

46
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:15,551
Congratulations. Enjoy.

47
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:27,521
Louis knows.

48
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:29,648
- Louis knows what?
- My dirty little secret.

49
00:02:29,774 --> 00:02:30,607
You're Canadian?

50
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:32,901
No.
He knows that I didn't go to Harvard.

51
00:02:33,027 --> 00:02:34,027
No, he doesn't.

52
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:35,320
How can you be
so sure about that?

53
00:02:35,446 --> 00:02:36,864
Because you're walking with me
right now.

54
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,574
He did this whole
Harvard Trivia thing.

55
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:39,825
And then,
he brought up this pizza.

56
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:41,451
- And I...
- Ah, doesn't mean he knows.

57
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:43,787
Look. I think we need to hack
into Harvard's system or something.

58
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:45,539
You know?
And put my records in.

59
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:48,876
I can't. I'm booked this weekend.
I'm breaking into Fort Knox.

60
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:50,669
I gotta return
some stolen "dubloons".

61
00:02:50,795 --> 00:02:53,088
Okay. Hilarious.
I'm serious.

62
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:55,465
Listen. Nobody is going
to check into your past

63
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:57,217
unless you give them reason to.

64
00:02:57,969 --> 00:03:01,013
Louis is devious,
but he's not bold.

65
00:03:01,472 --> 00:03:05,142
He won't think we did this. Because
he'd never think to do it himself.

66
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:08,979
- "Dubloons"?
- The ridiculousness of your suggestion

67
00:03:09,105 --> 00:03:10,606
warranted the use of a silly word.

68
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:11,940
Got it.

69
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:26,997
Was that Quentin Sainz
I just saw leaving?

70
00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:28,332
Mmm-hmm. You know him?

71
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:31,043
I know of him.
Why was he holding your hands?

72
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:32,085
Kissing them?

73
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:33,587
What are you implying,
Harvey?

74
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:35,380
I don't know.
Maybe you two are going steady.

75
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:38,884
I was implying that it looked
like he was grateful to you,

76
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:39,968
for taking his case.

77
00:03:40,094 --> 00:03:42,012
Good.
Because that's exactly what it was.

78
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:45,307
That's a bad move. We may make money
billing out on their defense,

79
00:03:45,433 --> 00:03:47,309
but when we lose,
which we will,

80
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:48,560
it's going to hurt us
in the long run.

81
00:03:48,686 --> 00:03:49,770
How do you know we'll lose?

82
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:51,688
Because it's my job
to know.

83
00:03:51,814 --> 00:03:54,483
His company's ALS wonder drug
is killing people.

84
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:55,859
ALS is incurable.

85
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:00,614
And everyone who is taking that drug
is going to die, anyway.

86
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:04,117
Hmm. That's your defense.
If he kills them a little faster,

87
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:05,452
it's a public service?

88
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:09,539
Our defense
is those allegations are untrue.

89
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,375
He has taken
this story all over town,

90
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:13,460
and not a single firm
thinks he has a case.

91
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:16,922
Which is why he came to me. Because
he wants someone who believes in him.

92
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:19,424
And what is it exactly
that makes you believe in him?

93
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:21,134
Well, I got to know
his character pretty well

94
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:22,594
during the time
that we were married.

95
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:27,933
Quentin is expecting you tomorrow.

96
00:04:31,145 --> 00:04:34,356
See the money, wanna stay
for your meal

97
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:37,943
Get another piece of pie
for your wife

98
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:41,196
Everybody wanna know
how it feel

99
00:04:41,322 --> 00:04:44,491
Everybody wanna see
what it's like

100
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:47,911
I'll even eat a bean pie
I don't mind

101
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:49,454
Me and missy is so early

102
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,540
Busy, busy making money

103
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:52,874
All right!

104
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:58,755
All step back
I'm 'bout to dance

105
00:04:58,881 --> 00:05:00,590
The greenback boogie

106
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,477
You forgot this last night.

107
00:05:12,603 --> 00:05:14,062
I didn't forget that.

108
00:05:14,188 --> 00:05:16,440
I have no intention
of taking this case.

109
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:18,942
Though I did get you this.

110
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:19,943
What is it?

111
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:22,070
Wedding gift.
I'm sorry it's so late,

112
00:05:22,196 --> 00:05:23,238
but it's hard to be on time

113
00:05:23,364 --> 00:05:24,906
when I never knew
you were married.

114
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:27,743
Are you seeing anyone,
Harvey?

115
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:29,244
Hmm?

116
00:05:30,621 --> 00:05:32,622
You don't want to tell me,
and I don't really care.

117
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:37,085
Because, you and I share the same trait
of keeping our personal lives personal.

118
00:05:37,211 --> 00:05:39,588
- You were married.
- It happened when you were at Harvard.

119
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:42,382
It didn't work out.
We were too dedicated to our careers,

120
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:44,634
and that's all
I'm going to say about it.

121
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:47,637
Okay. You're right.
It's none of my business.

122
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:50,724
- I'm still not taking this case.
- Why is that?

123
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:53,643
Because sometimes,
I do things that my clients don't like.

124
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:56,021
And if their ex-wives
are looking over my shoulders,

125
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:57,272
that's not really a problem.

126
00:05:57,398 --> 00:06:00,817
But when their ex-wives
are also my Managing Partner,

127
00:06:00,943 --> 00:06:02,569
that hamstrings me.

128
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:05,947
If I'm going to turn this loser
into a winner, I can't be hamstrung.

129
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:07,032
I can't have that.

130
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:11,036
Do what you've got to do.

131
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:13,622
- You won't interfere?
- What did I just say?

132
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:16,500
Do you have any idea
how hard it is

133
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:18,710
to develop a new drug
if you're not Pfizer

134
00:06:18,836 --> 00:06:20,712
or Amgen, or Merck?

135
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:23,131
This is important, Harvey.

136
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:26,593
If Quentin came to you
looking for someone who trusts him,

137
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:28,303
why aren't you handling
this case yourself?

138
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:29,805
That's none of your concern.

139
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:32,224
Well, I'm not asking you
as your colleague.

140
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:34,184
I'm asking
you as Quentin's attorney.

141
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:40,732
After Quentin and I separated,

142
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:45,487
he started seeing
one of his research consultants. Lisa.

143
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:46,947
They're still together.

144
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:48,490
But he never
married her.

145
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:50,492
She doesn't want me
on the case.

146
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:53,245
Oh, terrific.
You're sticking me with a losing case

147
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:56,206
and a girlfriend who isn't going
to like me any more than she likes you.

148
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:58,542
Well, I'm sure
it's not the first time

149
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:00,544
someone hasn't liked you,
Harvey.

150
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:05,006
Who doesn't like me?

151
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,300
Picture the devil
without the charm.

152
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:09,219
Okay. So, Karinski
owned this building for two years?

153
00:07:09,345 --> 00:07:11,054
Yeah. Then, things got bad.

154
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,431
Three below,
the heat went out.

155
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:14,516
I nearly froze to death.
Then, a gas leak in my stove.

156
00:07:14,642 --> 00:07:16,518
You could smell the damn thing,
but he said it was fine.

157
00:07:16,644 --> 00:07:18,812
I called for a month,
then I had to replace it myself.

158
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:20,981
Okay.
Why didn't you just move?

159
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:22,774
This is the apartment
I grew up in.

160
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,234
It's the only place
I've ever known.

161
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,153
I don't have
any brothers or sisters.

162
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:29,030
My parents
are not with me anymore.

163
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:30,490
I'm not leaving
the one connection

164
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:31,616
I have to them.

165
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:32,993
You said
you weren't sleeping.

166
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,454
Are you stressed out,
or...

167
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:36,455
Bedbugs.

168
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:38,039
- No.
- My place

169
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:39,833
is literally crawling with them.

170
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:42,252
Could you sleep, knowing the minute
you turn out the light,

171
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:44,045
- they're coming for you?
- No. I couldn't.

172
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:46,089
Well, Karinski won't do anything
about it without proof.

173
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:49,009
And I can't get someone from the city
down to verify they're there.

174
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:51,178
Don't worry. I can.

175
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:53,472
Two weeks,
next Thursday.

176
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:55,557
I... I... I don't think
that you heard me.

177
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:56,683
I need someone
down there today.

178
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:58,185
Two weeks,
next Thursday.

179
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:01,354
Okay. Uh, I'd like to speak
to your supervisor, please.

180
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:02,731
You can do that
next Wednesday.

181
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:04,191
Okay. Glenda?

182
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:07,694
Let me tell you what I'm going to do
between now and next Wednesday.

183
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:08,945
I know exactly
what you're going to do.

184
00:08:09,071 --> 00:08:10,572
You're going to do
what every other lawyer threatens to do.

185
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:12,532
You're going to file
a 409/3 grievance

186
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:14,367
claiming that I did
not fulfill my obligation

187
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,077
to promptly direct you
to my supervisor.

188
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:20,540
A grievance that will be passed
on to my supervisor next Wednesday.

189
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:24,294
No. What I'm going to do
is hire a private investigator

190
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:26,546
to look into every aspect
of your life,

191
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:29,341
from the day you were born
until next Tuesday.

192
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:31,551
And then, I'm going to use
whatever it is they find

193
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:33,345
to make you wish
that your biggest problem

194
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:37,933
was keeping this job
that you seem to hate so much.

195
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:41,853
Yeah, I'm not like
every other lawyer, Glenda.

196
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:43,104
What did you say
your name was?

197
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:47,150
Specter. Harvey Specter.

198
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:53,782
You a baseball fan?

199
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:54,741
I am.

200
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:57,577
Then, I assume you know
Lou Gehrig was a bad man.

201
00:08:58,287 --> 00:09:00,664
They didn't call him
"The Iron Horse" for nothing.

202
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:03,291
Then, he got ALS.
Do you know what it did to him?

203
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:05,877
His hands locked up,
then his legs.

204
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:09,172
His speech, eventually his breathing.
Couldn't control them.

205
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:11,841
His mind knew what it wanted,
but his body...

206
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:14,469
He was trapped inside,
unable to do anything.

207
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:17,973
Even today, you get ALS,
within three to five years, you die.

208
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:20,767
Or sooner, if someone takes your drug
and their liver fails.

209
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:23,395
Our drug makes people's
remaining years better,

210
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:25,105
and it doubles
their life expectancy.

211
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:26,773
Except for the people
whose livers are failing.

212
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:28,900
- You don't know...
- Lisa.

213
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:30,443
It's okay.

214
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:34,739
I can see why Jessica likes you.
You cut through the bullshit.

215
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,659
That's something
I always loved about her.

216
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:39,578
She just does it
with a little less charm than I do.

217
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:42,330
- Isn't she a little taller than you?
- It's the heels.

218
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:45,041
Let me tell you what it takes
to get a drug approved today.

219
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:49,296
We were 139 million into development
before we ever hit the shelves.

220
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:51,423
We jumped through every hoop
they threw at us

221
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:53,717
and we proved
our drug was safe for eight years.

222
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:55,302
So, you're saying
these claims are baseless?

223
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,679
We're talking about
six terminal patients

224
00:09:57,805 --> 00:09:59,514
with a wide array
of medical issues,

225
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,183
and they're saying
my company's drug caused this?

226
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:05,228
They were drinking coffee
on the Titanic.

227
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:08,023
I don't think that put
Leonardo DiCaprio in the water.

228
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:09,482
Since Jessica
vouched for you,

229
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:11,776
I'm going to go ahead
and believe what you're telling me.

230
00:10:11,902 --> 00:10:14,362
But since these other firms
determined you have exposure,

231
00:10:14,488 --> 00:10:16,489
here's what we're going to do.
We're going to pay them.

232
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:19,451
We're going to pay them a little bit
of money so you can keep saving lives.

233
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:22,329
Because if we drag this out,
people won't think of your drug

234
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:24,914
as a way to save lives.
They'll think of it as a death sentence.

235
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:31,212
The guy from the housing department's
going to be here in about five minutes.

236
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:32,964
How did you manage that?

237
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:34,382
You know,
they're actually pretty receptive

238
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:36,593
when you explain the situation to them.

239
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:38,720
That's what
you have to do.

240
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:40,013
Prevent the spread.

241
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:42,474
I had to get rid of most of my things.
Clothes.

242
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,059
A record collection. Books.

243
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:45,769
I had a first edition
Catcher in the Rye.

244
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:47,228
- You know what that was worth?
- No.

245
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:50,315
The bugs can live dormant
for 18 months.

246
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:51,775
You just have to
throw everything out.

247
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:56,738
- Frank.
- Karinski.

248
00:10:56,864 --> 00:10:58,114
- You're here.
- Yes.

249
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,866
- I live here.
- It's funny you should mention that.

250
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:02,327
Because you haven't paid rent
in four months, so I wasn't sure.

251
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:03,703
I haven't paid rent
because you haven't done...

252
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:07,791
My client has withheld rent
because the apartment is not habitable.

253
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:09,709
New York Housing Code,
subchapter two,

254
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:11,586
article four, section 27-20...

255
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:15,006
Hey. No rent, no apartment.
That's my code.

256
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:16,883
But if you want
something legal,

257
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:19,469
there's a court order.

258
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:21,179
You've got three days
to get out.

259
00:11:21,305 --> 00:11:23,932
Or the Sheriff's department
will empty the place for you.

260
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:25,517
Have a nice day.

261
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:38,697
You're late.

262
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:41,950
- Look. It was Louis' pro bono. I, uh...
- Hey, that's my suit.

263
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:43,493
My extra suit,
from my office.

264
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:45,286
Yeah.
It's, uh, Louis' fault.

265
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:48,039
I went to the client's place.
It was overrun with bedbugs.

266
00:11:48,165 --> 00:11:49,290
So, I went back
to the office.

267
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:51,042
Oh, you tracked bedbugs into my office?

268
00:11:51,168 --> 00:11:52,961
- No.
- Oh, you walked in there naked?

269
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:55,255
No, Donna met me
in the downstairs Men's Room, and...

270
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:56,840
Okay. Donna's fired,

271
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:58,258
and you're buying me
an extra suit.

272
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:00,719
By the way, that's a three-piece suit.
Where's the vest?

273
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:04,013
Yeah, I've been meaning to talk to you
about that. Vests? Really?

274
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,141
Says the guy
with the bike helmet.

275
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:08,601
Uh, safety first.

276
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:11,563
Come on.

277
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:19,404
Ah.

278
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:23,074
The House that Amylinx built.
Nice. Very nice.

279
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,870
Collin Church, Mr. Sainz.
And Mr. Specter.

280
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:29,873
Lately arrived
to our little legal dispute.

281
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:31,833
You say legal dispute,

282
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:33,001
I say shakedown.

283
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:36,087
Always a fine line between the two,
n'est-ce pas?

284
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:37,547
Look, we could
sit here and posture

285
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:39,591
about the strengths and weaknesses
of our cases,

286
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:41,926
but frankly,
that's going to bore the hell out of me.

287
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,556
Seriously?

288
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:47,557
It could be much lower.

289
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:49,184
It could be much higher.

290
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,853
Then, let's pretend
it's just right.

291
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:53,354
My clients' lives

292
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:55,273
are being cut short.

293
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:58,067
And according
to accepted calculations,

294
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:00,195
the current value
of a life

295
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:02,572
is 7.9 million dollars.

296
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:05,450
You're not even
offering pennies on that.

297
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:07,535
Those happen to be
EPA calculations

298
00:13:07,661 --> 00:13:09,662
based on
a full life expectancy.

299
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:12,791
Adjusted for plaintiffs whose expectancy
is just a fragment of this

300
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:17,378
yields a value
of $143,427.

301
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:20,423
Approximately.

302
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:23,092
What your child
fails to understand

303
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:24,719
is that
for someone with only

304
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:29,891
three to five years to live,
each day is worth infinitely more.

305
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:33,186
But the real crux
is the punitive damages.

306
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:36,689
Because if your client
wants to sell me the idea

307
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:42,070
that he didn't know about these side
effects years ago, I'm not buying it.

308
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:44,739
Which is why
we want $250 million.

309
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:45,990
- What?
- Quentin.

310
00:13:46,116 --> 00:13:47,075
No.

311
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:48,660
This is outrageous.

312
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:50,036
Do you know
what you're doing?

313
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:52,747
You're bankrupting this company
and taking away years of life

314
00:13:52,873 --> 00:13:56,209
from real people who are walking,
talking, and breathing easier

315
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:57,669
because of
the drug we make.

316
00:13:58,254 --> 00:14:01,589
I don't represent those people.
My clients...

317
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:03,049
Have tenuous claims at best.

318
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:06,219
And unless one of your six is
Rupert Murdoch, you're out of your mind.

319
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:08,221
Okay.

320
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:14,602
You printed that?

321
00:14:14,728 --> 00:14:17,146
Well, not yet.
But I will.

322
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:18,523
You realize
that's libelous.

323
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:20,525
Maybe it is,
maybe it isn't.

324
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:24,612
But after it runs, you and I
both know it won't much matter.

325
00:14:24,738 --> 00:14:25,738
We're done here.

326
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:27,115
I don't take
to extortion.

327
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:28,950
I'm not going to be bullied
by an ambulance chaser,

328
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:30,702
no matter
how nice the suit.

329
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:31,744
It is nice, isn't it?

330
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:34,455
Italian. And it fits.

331
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:37,542
$250 million,
Mr. Sainz.

332
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:40,920
I'll give you
four days.

333
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:52,640
Church wants to play,
we play.

334
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,727
I have housing court
in the morning.

335
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:58,021
It's housing court.
Your grandmother could win.

336
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:01,774
Let's see just how real
his clients' liver problems are.

337
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:04,903
And if they are real, we suggest
they're from the disease itself.

338
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:06,529
Or they took
the wrong dose.

339
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:09,282
Or they took a cocktail
of combined drugs.

340
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:12,076
Also, I want to see
Quentin's company financials.

341
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:13,453
I already asked
for them once.

342
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:15,788
I want you to call them and follow up.
I want to know everything

343
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,290
Church could go after.

344
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:20,460
So, we've gone
from settlement to scorched earth.

345
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:22,712
I didn't feel like
writing a quarter billion dollar check.

346
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:24,505
- It's a negotiation.
- Exactly.

347
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:26,549
That's why I'm arming myself
for the next round.

348
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:28,384
By digging into Quentin?

349
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:30,386
I'm a boy scout.
I like to be prepared.

350
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:36,476
So, you think you'll look
like a boy scout

351
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:39,604
by putting dying people on the stand
and tearing them apart.

352
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:42,398
You're going to look
like an asshole.

353
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:46,444
For every one they claim has
a side effect, we have 600 who don't.

354
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:48,112
And if I need to look
like an asshole

355
00:15:48,238 --> 00:15:50,239
to convince the jury
that hundreds

356
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:51,783
are more important
than the one,

357
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:53,660
I'm not going to lose
a minute's sleep over it.

358
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:56,788
Uh, I have court in...
In the morning.

359
00:15:58,582 --> 00:16:01,000
Oh, I'm...
I'm not clear.

360
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:03,419
Was this a conversation
with my Managing Partner

361
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:04,837
or my client's ex-wife?

362
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:06,965
You need to settle this case,
Harvey.

363
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:09,300
Which I will do
if you stay out of it.

364
00:16:09,843 --> 00:16:11,427
As you promised.

365
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:14,889
Make it go away.

366
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:18,977
- Rachel. I need to talk to you.
- Go away.

367
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:20,853
Uh-oh.
Who's picking on you now, Mikey?

368
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,814
Mom and dad
are fighting.

369
00:16:23,273 --> 00:16:25,233
- Harvey and Jessica.
- What do you care?

370
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:28,403
Uh, I'm just rattled.
I have my first trial tomorrow.

371
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:29,696
Housing court.

372
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:31,155
Housing court?

373
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:33,533
I could win
at housing court.

374
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:35,368
You'll be fine.

375
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:37,245
But not
if you wear that suit.

376
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:49,632
Carvello v. Karinski Properties.

377
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:51,843
So, how does
this usually work?

378
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:55,179
Uh, well, usually,
the trial starts,

379
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:56,764
and, uh,
there's a judge.

380
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:59,684
And then, you know,
people say... Things.

381
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:01,686
You've never done this before,
have you?

382
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:04,772
Well, I never drove a car before
the first time I drove one,

383
00:17:04,898 --> 00:17:06,524
and I'm still here,
aren't I?

384
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:09,360
Oh.
This is your first time?

385
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:11,946
I'm your first?

386
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:15,283
Don't worry.
I promise not to be gentle.

387
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:17,702
Frank,
it's nice to see you...

388
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:19,454
One last time.

389
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:22,790
Uh,
if it pleases the court...

390
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:26,627
It pleases the Court to decide
who speaks and when.

391
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:30,798
I'll sit down.

392
00:17:30,924 --> 00:17:33,593
We're talking about
$4000 in withheld rent payments?

393
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:36,054
Uh, yes, Your Honor,
but we have receipts

394
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,930
for repairs,
lost clothing,

395
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,266
as well as...

396
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:42,351
$4000. Yes, Your Honor.

397
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:43,561
She was talking to me.

398
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:48,191
Why hasn't he paid,
Counselor?

399
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:51,360
Uh,
that one was for you.

400
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:53,071
Uh, bedbugs,
Your Honor.

401
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:54,489
I have receipts
that show

402
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:56,657
my client's
financial outlay

403
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:59,243
to rectify the problem
far exceeds the amount.

404
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:02,288
Housing Department
certified the presence of bedbugs?

405
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:04,499
- Uh, yes, Your Honor.
- Abatement?

406
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:09,295
- Uh...
- Excuse...

407
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:10,463
- Ex...
- I'll do it.

408
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:11,923
- There you go.
- That's...

409
00:18:13,842 --> 00:18:15,843
Your Honor,
this is an eviction hearing.

410
00:18:15,969 --> 00:18:17,970
The pertinent question
is not habitability,

411
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:19,639
but whether or not
rent has been paid.

412
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:23,351
Actually, city code states
that rent may be withheld

413
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:26,646
if the warranty of habitability
is breached.

414
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:29,941
In that case,
we request to see the checks

415
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:31,692
Mr. Ross' client
has placed in escrow.

416
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:33,986
- The... The...
- Checks.

417
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:35,029
In escrow.

418
00:18:35,155 --> 00:18:37,406
Pending the outcome
of a rent abatement hearing?

419
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:39,283
That's not in the code.

420
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:41,119
It is the accepted practice.

421
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:44,122
And therefore,
binding in this courtroom.

422
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:46,916
Your client did put money in escrow,
I assume.

423
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:48,835
- I didn't have any money left. I had...
- Your Honor.

424
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:50,628
Eviction upheld.

425
00:18:50,754 --> 00:18:53,339
- But Your Honor, he...
- Did you see me bang the gavel?

426
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:55,800
That means step aside.
Next case.

427
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:59,137
You never forget
your first.

428
00:19:08,355 --> 00:19:11,315
You know what happens to pitchers when
they get shelled in Rookie League, Mike?

429
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:13,025
You think they
make it to the bigs?

430
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:17,238
Or do they just end up on some
sad American Legion team of has-beens?

431
00:19:17,364 --> 00:19:19,240
I get it. I lost.
I'm sorry.

432
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:23,452
Well. You're sorry.

433
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:26,414
- In that case...
- No, I am sorry.

434
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:29,458
But right now,
I have some research to do for Harvey.

435
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:30,751
So, if you'll excuse me.

436
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:33,296
Remember when you stole that client
I had you bring in?

437
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:35,089
That was a good time for you,
wasn't it?

438
00:19:35,215 --> 00:19:38,050
See, I gave you a nothing case
so that when you did win,

439
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:40,344
it would still do nothing
for your career.

440
00:19:41,096 --> 00:19:42,889
But I still expected
you to win.

441
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:47,852
So, yeah.
I guess go back to your research.

442
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:49,520
Maybe that is your niche.

443
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,816
Maybe it is.

444
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:04,577
Most mornings,
I can make it out of the chair.

445
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:05,995
Get across the floor.

446
00:20:08,248 --> 00:20:09,540
And I can hold my daughter.

447
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:15,004
How many were in the study?

448
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:18,382
Four hundred and twelve,
over two years.

449
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:20,092
And we have videos
of all of them.

450
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:22,261
Twenty-five percent
were given placebos.

451
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:24,764
The rest,
varying doses of Amylinx.

452
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,432
And more than half
are like that one,

453
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:28,559
showing significant
signs of improvement.

454
00:20:28,685 --> 00:20:31,354
And you're telling me
there was nothing affecting the liver.

455
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,605
Yes.

456
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:35,316
And if you're just coming
to question that, we'll move on.

457
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:39,445
You don't like it that Quentin
went to his ex-wife, do you?

458
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:41,072
No, I don't.

459
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:44,075
I don't want any garbage from the past
getting in the way.

460
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:47,954
I mean, what Quentin's done here
is nothing short of miraculous.

461
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,123
I think I may have found a way
to keep that miracle going.

462
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,960
I was going through
the plaintiffs' medical files.

463
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:55,920
And then,
I found this.

464
00:20:58,048 --> 00:20:59,173
This is good.

465
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:01,676
This is really good.

466
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:03,719
Jones v. Norco.

467
00:21:03,845 --> 00:21:06,347
Washburn v. Hawthorne,
Incorporated.

468
00:21:06,473 --> 00:21:09,100
Actually,
seven cases that Mr. Church

469
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:11,852
solicited lawsuits against
pharmaceutical companies.

470
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:13,145
In each case,

471
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:14,981
he was able
to exact a settlement

472
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:17,566
because the company knew
that even if they won,

473
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:20,987
a protracted battle
would do more damage than settling.

474
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:22,196
You have evidence of that?

475
00:21:22,322 --> 00:21:24,949
Plaintiff number two in our case.
Eleanor Baker.

476
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:28,786
She also happens to be plaintiff
number seven in Jones v. Norco.

477
00:21:28,912 --> 00:21:31,580
He's recycling plaintiffs.
That's very green of you.

478
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:32,790
Mr. Church?

479
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:36,168
Mr. Specter has his documents,
I have mine.

480
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:40,214
Showing that prior to FDA approval
of his drug,

481
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:43,551
Quentin Sainz company
was on the verge of bankruptcy.

482
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:46,512
Three months after that drug
hit the market,

483
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:50,016
sales rocketed
to $38 million a quarter.

484
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:52,226
Which is clear
financial motive

485
00:21:52,352 --> 00:21:54,312
for falsifying
clinical trials.

486
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:57,815
Now, Your Honor, does that sound
like a groundless claim to you?

487
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:00,735
I told you
to go over those financials.

488
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:03,446
I asked them five times.
They never gave them to me.

489
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:05,489
- Your Honor.
- Mr. Specter.

490
00:22:05,615 --> 00:22:08,784
You can question his tactics
all you'd like at trial. But he's right.

491
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:10,870
That right there
is financial motive for fraud.

492
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:13,164
This case
is moving forward.

493
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:15,833
Thank you, Your Honor.

494
00:22:36,396 --> 00:22:38,439
- Jessica, what are you doing here?
- Get in.

495
00:22:38,565 --> 00:22:40,441
I was just about to get some coffee.
Uh...

496
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:51,452
I heard about
your little setback in court.

497
00:22:51,578 --> 00:22:54,747
Getting blind-sided by my own client
holding back isn't a setback.

498
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:56,499
- It's an embarrassment.
- What are you talking about?

499
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:58,084
Did you ever think
it's time to consider

500
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:00,503
that he isn't the upstanding man
that you think he is?

501
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:04,924
When we were married...

502
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:07,009
When I took a client
Quentin knew was guilty,

503
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:08,260
he never shut up about it.

504
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:10,888
He went on and on
about right and wrong.

505
00:23:11,014 --> 00:23:12,306
Sounds annoyingly
self-righteous.

506
00:23:12,432 --> 00:23:13,682
It was.

507
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:16,143
But it's also how I know
he didn't do this.

508
00:23:16,269 --> 00:23:19,480
For all his faults,
Quentin has never lied to me before.

509
00:23:19,606 --> 00:23:21,232
And he's not lying
about this.

510
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:25,486
So, stop questioning his ethics
and start winning this case.

511
00:23:25,612 --> 00:23:27,988
We had a deal
that you were going to stay out of it.

512
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:29,573
You don't know
everything I know.

513
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:31,700
All right.

514
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:33,119
That's not
staying out of it.

515
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:34,620
No, you're right.

516
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:36,372
I'm not staying out of it anymore.

517
00:23:45,298 --> 00:23:46,257
I'm sorry.

518
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:48,050
You looked into his background
this deeply?

519
00:23:48,176 --> 00:23:50,302
The investigation
reveals what it reveals.

520
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:52,888
If he lied about this,
he could have lied about anything.

521
00:23:53,014 --> 00:23:56,142
You think I didn't know he started
with Lisa before we were separated?

522
00:23:57,352 --> 00:24:00,563
This is old news, Harvey.
I moved on a long time ago.

523
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:02,648
Jessica,
it's a pattern of behavior.

524
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:05,526
Quentin came to me because he knew
I thought he was a good man.

525
00:24:05,652 --> 00:24:07,528
And I still do.

526
00:24:07,654 --> 00:24:08,988
You obviously don't.

527
00:24:10,073 --> 00:24:11,282
I'm taking the case.

528
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:15,786
What about Lisa?

529
00:24:15,912 --> 00:24:18,289
If Lisa
has a problem with it,

530
00:24:18,415 --> 00:24:20,833
then Lisa
can take it up with me.

531
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:25,504
It's kind of ironic isn't it?
You and I both lost in court yesterday?

532
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:26,839
You lost?

533
00:24:27,424 --> 00:24:28,466
In Housing Court?

534
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:30,593
How does one lose
in Housing Court?

535
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:32,011
People win there
without lawyers.

536
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:33,762
Well, he had a lawyer.
Tanaka. And she...

537
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:35,055
Vivien Tanaka?

538
00:24:35,182 --> 00:24:36,182
Yeah. What, you know her?

539
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:39,560
If your landlord is using Vivien Tanaka,
this isn't about bedbugs.

540
00:24:39,686 --> 00:24:42,813
Vivien Tanaka represents
half the high-rises in Manhattan.

541
00:24:42,939 --> 00:24:45,774
This isn't a petty rent dispute.
Your guy's going condo.

542
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:46,942
Well, that's great.

543
00:24:47,068 --> 00:24:48,944
Forcing Frank out for a conversion
is harassment.

544
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:50,154
I can go after him
for that.

545
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,198
No.
You want to take down Vivien?

546
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:55,242
You better go in there
with more than just one client.

547
00:24:55,368 --> 00:24:57,328
You show the pattern,
the settlement goes up.

548
00:24:57,454 --> 00:25:00,289
If they did this to him,
I guarantee they've done this to others.

549
00:25:00,415 --> 00:25:02,708
So, I should find other people
in Frank's building?

550
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:03,876
Think bigger.

551
00:25:05,086 --> 00:25:06,462
Bigger how?

552
00:25:12,719 --> 00:25:14,345
Karinski owns five buildings.

553
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:15,930
And they all used to be
rent-controlled.

554
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:18,265
But now,
they go for a million and a half a unit.

555
00:25:18,391 --> 00:25:19,391
Nice profit margin.

556
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:21,352
I went to look
for Housing Department complaints

557
00:25:21,478 --> 00:25:23,145
in the year prior
to his remodel.

558
00:25:23,271 --> 00:25:25,773
In each one of them, tenants
who couldn't buy into the conversion

559
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:27,107
ended up
with some complaint.

560
00:25:27,234 --> 00:25:29,652
You know, garbage, heat, air.
All of them.

561
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:31,654
One by one,
Karinski drove them out.

562
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:33,280
You couldn't get their names
from Housing Complaints?

563
00:25:33,406 --> 00:25:37,326
No. He gave me some names, but I need to
make this bigger than just his building.

564
00:25:37,452 --> 00:25:39,954
Look, I only get one hour off a day
for lunch, and I never take it.

565
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,247
You really need me
for this?

566
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:43,040
You see these people
who are leaving the building?

567
00:25:43,166 --> 00:25:44,458
Mmm-hmm.

568
00:25:44,584 --> 00:25:47,044
The entire building
looks like them.

569
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:48,712
I know I clean up okay,
but...

570
00:25:48,838 --> 00:25:51,173
Mmm. You need me
to class you up a bit.

571
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:53,425
- Not class. But...
- Class.

572
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:55,302
Whatever
gets you through the door.

573
00:25:55,428 --> 00:25:57,429
- Alright. You ready?
- Yeah.

574
00:25:57,556 --> 00:26:00,683
Hi, there. Uh, my wife and I
are here to see some of the new units.

575
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:02,768
Isn't that right, honey?

576
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:05,938
So, what do you think,
sweetheart?

577
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:09,441
Hmm, it's fine.
But I liked the place on 52nd better.

578
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:12,278
Fifty-second? That's awful close
to your mother.

579
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:13,988
No, no.
We're not talking about my mother.

580
00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:16,448
Oh, I... Okay.
That doesn't matter to me.

581
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:18,784
I mean, I love being near your mother.
I love your mother.

582
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:20,661
Crazy.

583
00:26:20,787 --> 00:26:23,455
So, why don't you tell us something
about your little building?

584
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:26,458
Well, I think you'll find that not only
are the amenities top quality,

585
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:28,502
- so are the tenants.
- That's good to hear.

586
00:26:28,628 --> 00:26:30,879
You know, because we're not just looking
at buying square footage,

587
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:32,881
but really put down
some roots.

588
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:34,800
That is such the right way
to look at it.

589
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:36,760
- Is it?
- Yes. And I think you'll also find

590
00:26:36,886 --> 00:26:38,512
that the people who've bought here,
they're like you.

591
00:26:38,638 --> 00:26:40,431
They're young, ambitious.

592
00:26:41,683 --> 00:26:42,975
We're acting.

593
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:44,184
It's just,
you keep touching me.

594
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:46,937
Is there a problem?
Any other questions I can answer?

595
00:26:47,063 --> 00:26:49,815
I'm sorry. My wife, here...
My beautiful wife

596
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:52,067
just gets a little paranoid sometimes.

597
00:26:52,193 --> 00:26:54,361
You know, you wouldn't believe
how long it took her

598
00:26:54,487 --> 00:26:56,363
to just go out with me
in the first place.

599
00:26:56,489 --> 00:26:58,616
Forever.

600
00:26:58,742 --> 00:27:00,784
Are there any other tenants
who have been here for a while?

601
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:03,370
You know, who might be able to show us
the ins and outs of the place?

602
00:27:03,496 --> 00:27:04,330
The neighborhood?

603
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:07,166
Well, the building
was totally renovated two years ago.

604
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:10,669
So, most of our tenants are newer.
We only reopened in January.

605
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:12,296
Mmm.

606
00:27:12,422 --> 00:27:15,674
But I think there are
some of the old tenants who bought in.

607
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,801
Do you think that we might be able
to speak to them?

608
00:27:17,927 --> 00:27:19,470
Just to be sure.
It would really make us

609
00:27:19,596 --> 00:27:21,180
feel more comfortable.

610
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:22,473
Ow.

611
00:27:23,933 --> 00:27:26,185
She's feisty.

612
00:27:26,686 --> 00:27:28,062
- So in love.
- Yes.

613
00:27:28,188 --> 00:27:30,397
- So in love.
- Yes, we are.

614
00:27:38,448 --> 00:27:40,532
You came to me
because you wanted someone

615
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:42,576
who knows you always tell the truth.

616
00:27:42,702 --> 00:27:45,037
- Well, you don't.
- What are you talking about?

617
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:45,996
Lisa.

618
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:48,540
I asked you back then

619
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:51,377
if anything had started
before we were separated.

620
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:53,837
You said it hadn't,
and I believed you.

621
00:27:53,963 --> 00:27:55,339
Because I didn't
want to hurt you.

622
00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:57,091
You want to know
what hurts me?

623
00:27:57,217 --> 00:27:59,760
I thought it was my ambition
that caused our divorce.

624
00:27:59,886 --> 00:28:01,512
- I never said that.
- No.

625
00:28:01,638 --> 00:28:03,138
But you let me believe it.

626
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:05,974
I shouldn't have started with Lisa
when I did.

627
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:09,645
But it happened long after you and I
both know we weren't working.

628
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:12,314
I'm sorry.

629
00:28:14,901 --> 00:28:17,236
I'm sorry I didn't have the courage
to tell you then.

630
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:22,241
What about now?

631
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:23,867
Now?

632
00:28:24,244 --> 00:28:25,577
They're manipulating
the facts.

633
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:28,706
And I'm not going to apologize
just because we happened to hit it big

634
00:28:28,832 --> 00:28:30,416
when I was about to lose everything.

635
00:28:32,127 --> 00:28:34,586
I'm going to defend you
either way.

636
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:37,172
Because I took this case,
and that's what I do.

637
00:28:37,298 --> 00:28:39,258
But if I'm going
to stake my reputation on this,

638
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:41,260
then I need to know
if there are any other lies

639
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:44,471
that are going to come up
and sandbag me.

640
00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:46,974
And I need to know
right now.

641
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:56,775
Thanks.

642
00:28:57,777 --> 00:28:59,319
I see I have
some catching up to do.

643
00:29:05,118 --> 00:29:07,745
People are stupid
when they're young.

644
00:29:08,621 --> 00:29:09,621
Do you want to know why?

645
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:12,750
I want to know why they're stupid
all the other years of their lives.

646
00:29:16,671 --> 00:29:19,381
Glenfiddich. Smooth.
That's nice.

647
00:29:21,676 --> 00:29:23,051
You never got married.

648
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:26,513
Now we're sharing
our personal lives?

649
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:31,101
Till death do us part.

650
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:34,188
I actually believed it.

651
00:29:34,314 --> 00:29:37,024
Did he falsify
the clinical trials?

652
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:39,318
He says
he wouldn't do that.

653
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:41,278
So, why are we drinking?

654
00:29:42,322 --> 00:29:44,531
He says
he wouldn't do that

655
00:29:46,075 --> 00:29:47,951
because he needs
the drug to work.

656
00:29:51,998 --> 00:29:53,540
He's dying.

657
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,629
Quentin has ALS.

658
00:30:18,733 --> 00:30:21,026
Ms. Parker,
how long have you worked for Mr. Sainz?

659
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:23,237
Well, technically,
I'm an independent consultant.

660
00:30:23,363 --> 00:30:25,697
But I've been a part of Amylinx
from the beginning.

661
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:27,699
Yes.
I imagine you have been.

662
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:30,536
We're just trying to establish
your credentials for testifying for him.

663
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:33,205
How long have you known
Quentin had ALS?

664
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:36,875
- From the beginning.
- And how long have you known

665
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:40,712
Quentin falsified trial results
to get the drug on the market?

666
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:42,214
To save his own life.

667
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:43,423
What?

668
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:44,883
No. He wouldn't do that.

669
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:46,093
Come on, Lisa.

670
00:30:46,219 --> 00:30:47,928
We're all
on the same team here.

671
00:30:48,054 --> 00:30:50,514
We're trying to figure out
how to protect the man you love.

672
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,558
Well,
I thought you believed in him.

673
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:58,063
You slept with Quentin
while he was married to me.

674
00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:02,693
He said it never happened,
and I believed him.

675
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:05,529
But I have learned
that he can lie.

676
00:31:05,655 --> 00:31:08,824
So, do I believe in him now?
No.

677
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:13,495
This is damage control.

678
00:31:13,621 --> 00:31:16,164
We're just trying to protect him.
Because they will find out

679
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:17,666
and he will get caught.

680
00:31:17,792 --> 00:31:20,419
And if you don't tell us
the real facts,

681
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:22,880
we can't mitigate
the damage from his lie.

682
00:31:23,006 --> 00:31:24,590
But he didn't lie.

683
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:28,051
I swear he didn't.

684
00:31:28,177 --> 00:31:30,095
But you did,
didn't you?

685
00:31:31,639 --> 00:31:33,891
He was sick.
He needed the drug,

686
00:31:34,017 --> 00:31:36,059
and you would have done anything
for FDA approval.

687
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:39,062
Come on, Lisa.
Help us help him.

688
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:43,817
You didn't see
what he was like.

689
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:48,030
He was barely Quentin then.

690
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:50,240
And then, he got better.

691
00:31:50,366 --> 00:31:52,701
And I've never seen
anything like it.

692
00:31:53,286 --> 00:31:55,078
I was the one to see it.

693
00:31:55,204 --> 00:31:57,039
See what, exactly?

694
00:31:58,583 --> 00:31:59,625
Six months in,

695
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:04,046
one person out of the hundreds
started showing signs of liver damage.

696
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:05,380
And that would
jeopardize approval.

697
00:32:05,506 --> 00:32:08,717
Yeah, and I couldn't take that chance.
So, I took the person out of the study.

698
00:32:08,843 --> 00:32:09,968
You never told Quentin?

699
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:12,471
No. He would have waited.
And we didn't have the time.

700
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:14,723
He didn't have the time.

701
00:32:14,849 --> 00:32:15,933
And I love him.

702
00:32:17,644 --> 00:32:19,353
So, what else could I do?

703
00:32:21,814 --> 00:32:23,732
Look,
there is an upside to all of this.

704
00:32:23,858 --> 00:32:24,816
Upside?

705
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:27,110
To the fact that I
unknowingly defrauded the FDA?

706
00:32:27,236 --> 00:32:29,321
Well, the key word
is "Unknowingly."

707
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:31,448
Lisa is an outside contractor.

708
00:32:31,574 --> 00:32:33,784
The company may be liable
for actual damages,

709
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:36,161
but we can shift the blame
for the fraud to Lisa.

710
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:37,287
There would be
a small payment,

711
00:32:37,413 --> 00:32:38,956
but you might be able
to keep the drug on the market.

712
00:32:39,082 --> 00:32:40,457
And throw Lisa
under the bus?

713
00:32:40,583 --> 00:32:42,292
She was throwing you
under the bus.

714
00:32:42,418 --> 00:32:44,336
She was trying
to save my life.

715
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:49,466
Would there be
criminal charges?

716
00:32:49,592 --> 00:32:50,842
Possibly.

717
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:53,762
She should get her own lawyer.
It's a conflict for us.

718
00:32:53,888 --> 00:32:55,639
Look,
our goal is to protect you.

719
00:32:56,349 --> 00:32:57,975
I don't know.

720
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:03,730
There is an alternative.

721
00:33:04,565 --> 00:33:06,608
You can join
Church's lawsuit.

722
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:08,986
Jessica,
we're lawyers for the company.

723
00:33:09,112 --> 00:33:10,487
We can't advise him
to do that.

724
00:33:10,613 --> 00:33:12,447
- Harvey, this is his life.
- That's not the point.

725
00:33:12,573 --> 00:33:14,574
This is my case,
my call.

726
00:33:14,701 --> 00:33:18,245
Wait, wait, wait.
What would that mean?

727
00:33:18,371 --> 00:33:20,330
Sainz Pharmaceuticals
would go down,

728
00:33:20,456 --> 00:33:22,374
but you'd share
in the settlement.

729
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,917
You could open
a new company.

730
00:33:24,043 --> 00:33:26,420
Keep the drug alive
under a different corporate umbrella.

731
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:28,171
I'm not pretending
I'm one of them.

732
00:33:28,297 --> 00:33:30,048
You are one of them.

733
00:33:31,467 --> 00:33:33,844
I can't do that.
It's not who I am.

734
00:33:34,762 --> 00:33:36,638
Now,
isn't there another way?

735
00:33:36,764 --> 00:33:38,724
You are one of them.

736
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:40,767
And they're one of you.

737
00:33:45,606 --> 00:33:48,316
Mike, we've got work to do.
Where are you?

738
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:51,445
Oh, I'm looking at you right now
in conference room C.

739
00:33:51,571 --> 00:33:54,281
I'm sorry.
Can you please excuse me?

740
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:56,324
AA meeting?
Here in the office?

741
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:58,285
Funny.
No, it's my law suit.

742
00:33:58,411 --> 00:34:00,370
- Which suit is that?
- Against Johnny Karinski.

743
00:34:00,496 --> 00:34:04,249
Between Frank's building and the one
Rachel and I are about to buy into.

744
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:06,084
Oh, yeah.
Uh, we're married.

745
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:09,212
It's a long story.
Look, you said think bigger. Right?

746
00:34:09,338 --> 00:34:12,299
I tracked down 15 former tenants
who are willing to testify

747
00:34:12,425 --> 00:34:15,635
to all manner of harassment that forced
them out of their apartments.

748
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:16,845
You did this overnight?

749
00:34:16,971 --> 00:34:18,638
Yeah.
I couldn't sleep, anyway.

750
00:34:18,765 --> 00:34:20,182
I kept thinking
I felt bedbugs.

751
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:23,727
But I get these people
in front of a judge to tell their story,

752
00:34:23,853 --> 00:34:27,939
and there is no way that Vivien Tanaka
can spin this to save Karinski's ass.

753
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:30,484
You should
hear their stories.

754
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:32,360
It would
break your heart.

755
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:34,196
Yeah,
if you had a heart.

756
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:37,783
Emotion is fine, but you better have
some cold, hard facts to back it up.

757
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:40,243
Because Vivien Tanaka
is no pushover.

758
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:44,206
But... It's good work.
Keep at it.

759
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:46,917
I'm going to go do
what I've got to go do.

760
00:34:53,216 --> 00:34:55,842
We need more.

761
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:58,887
How are we
going to get more?

762
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:02,224
Mike?

763
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:04,434
Is this the building
we were in yesterday?

764
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:08,480
No rent, no apartment.
That's my code.

765
00:35:08,606 --> 00:35:10,899
Yeah. Before and after.

766
00:35:14,403 --> 00:35:16,738
We need to go
carpet shopping.

767
00:35:19,909 --> 00:35:21,284
I see you found my ad.

768
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:23,662
Trying to steal my thunder,
Harvey?

769
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:27,624
Business School 101. You have a crisis,
you acknowledge the problem.

770
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:29,960
You want to be Tylenol,
not Toyota.

771
00:35:30,086 --> 00:35:33,380
A little late for you to acknowledge
this is a crisis.

772
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:41,138
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you
very much for coming here today.

773
00:35:41,264 --> 00:35:43,306
Quentin Sainz
placed this ad

774
00:35:43,432 --> 00:35:46,309
because your lawsuit made it clear
that his drug

775
00:35:46,435 --> 00:35:48,770
had side effects
that he didn't know about.

776
00:35:48,896 --> 00:35:52,274
We wanted to know
how widespread this problem was.

777
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,985
We had an outpouring
of response.

778
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:56,153
Not from people

779
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:57,904
struggling like yourselves,

780
00:35:58,030 --> 00:36:00,574
but from people desperate
to keep the drug available.

781
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:04,202
You think we're lying.

782
00:36:04,787 --> 00:36:08,540
You're here because you think this
company has been hiding things from you.

783
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:10,625
And you're right.

784
00:36:10,751 --> 00:36:11,751
They have.

785
00:36:11,878 --> 00:36:14,379
But Quentin
wants to come clean.

786
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:17,757
He wants to show you exactly
what it is that he's been hiding.

787
00:36:20,136 --> 00:36:22,429
I can't really open it.

788
00:36:22,555 --> 00:36:24,347
I can't hold anything.

789
00:36:24,473 --> 00:36:26,683
And, uh, I don't know how much longer
I can keep working.

790
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:29,186
It will get better.

791
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:31,313
It will.
You know it will.

792
00:36:33,482 --> 00:36:35,317
I guess.

793
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:37,986
I bet my life on it.

794
00:36:41,657 --> 00:36:44,618
It's not fair you got ALS
in the first place.

795
00:36:45,494 --> 00:36:48,788
And it's definitely not fair you had
side effects from the drug I created

796
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:50,081
and I didn't.

797
00:36:51,417 --> 00:36:53,126
But now
that I know they exist,

798
00:36:53,252 --> 00:36:55,086
I want to fix them.

799
00:36:56,005 --> 00:36:58,089
So that people like you...

800
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:01,885
And maybe even you

801
00:37:02,011 --> 00:37:04,304
can have
what I have right now.

802
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:05,680
But he can't.

803
00:37:05,806 --> 00:37:08,308
He can't if he gives you
what you're asking.

804
00:37:08,434 --> 00:37:11,144
We're not saying
that you don't deserve compensation.

805
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:13,605
Our commitment to you
is this.

806
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:15,315
We are offering you

807
00:37:15,441 --> 00:37:17,901
partial ownership
in his company.

808
00:37:18,027 --> 00:37:20,487
A company
that is trying to save lives.

809
00:37:20,613 --> 00:37:23,740
Money isn't going
to help you live longer.

810
00:37:23,866 --> 00:37:25,408
Taking the deal

811
00:37:25,534 --> 00:37:28,453
and letting Quentin
try and fix the problem could.

812
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:33,166
Like it or not,
you're all in the same boat.

813
00:37:33,292 --> 00:37:37,003
Give Quentin the opportunity
to keep that boat from sinking.

814
00:37:58,734 --> 00:38:00,151
They really
took the offer.

815
00:38:01,028 --> 00:38:02,904
Uh-huh.
Church didn't like it.

816
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:05,490
- Hmm.
- But they didn't like Church.

817
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:06,992
- They liked you.
- Hmm.

818
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:08,618
And me.

819
00:38:10,913 --> 00:38:11,997
Who wouldn't?

820
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:14,165
Oh, your mother
was never a fan.

821
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:16,876
Want to know the truth?
My father wasn't much of a fan, either.

822
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:19,462
Now, that is a lie and I know it.

823
00:38:20,506 --> 00:38:23,300
Real truth is, they'd both
take you over Lisa in a minute.

824
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:34,102
I'm sorry.

825
00:38:36,772 --> 00:38:37,981
I'm sorry, too.

826
00:38:40,943 --> 00:38:44,070
From now on,
back to no more lies.

827
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:46,865
Well,
if we're going to do that...

828
00:38:48,868 --> 00:38:51,578
You remember that time
that your Jag got side-swiped

829
00:38:51,704 --> 00:38:53,204
when it was parked
outside the house?

830
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:54,331
Yeah.

831
00:38:54,457 --> 00:38:56,916
Yeah, it didn't exactly
go down that way.

832
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:02,714
I was mad.

833
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:03,798
You were mad.

834
00:39:08,888 --> 00:39:11,139
Oh, you brought a sack lunch.
We would have shared.

835
00:39:11,265 --> 00:39:12,724
Amusing.

836
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:14,601
As was this.
Your little lawsuit.

837
00:39:14,727 --> 00:39:17,854
Take your sack of presents and run, kid.

838
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:19,522
You're in way over your head.

839
00:39:19,648 --> 00:39:21,608
Oh, I think
he'll be just fine.

840
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:22,901
Hello, Vivien.

841
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:24,194
Hello.

842
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,237
So, the rookie
called in the veteran.

843
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:29,449
No, no. I'm just here to watch.
I love spectator sports.

844
00:39:29,575 --> 00:39:32,369
You enjoy watching the Yankees
destroy a little league team?

845
00:39:32,495 --> 00:39:35,872
David and Goliath happens to be
one of my favorite stories.

846
00:39:35,998 --> 00:39:38,083
Okay. I'll bite.

847
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:39,584
What's in the bag?

848
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,091
Hey, hey.
What are you doing?

849
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:47,842
Oh.
Do you recognize this carpet?

850
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:49,094
Make him
get that out of here.

851
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:52,847
This is your own carpet, Mr. Karinski.
It's from Frank Carvello's apartment.

852
00:39:52,973 --> 00:39:54,224
Come on.

853
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:58,061
You feel the fibers, the texture.
It's almost alive.

854
00:39:58,187 --> 00:39:59,604
You brought bedbugs in here.

855
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:02,107
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
That's vandalism! Assault!

856
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:04,025
You know,
I'm happy that you put it that way,

857
00:40:04,151 --> 00:40:06,694
because that's exactly what we're
going to be charging your client with.

858
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:07,862
What are you talking about?

859
00:40:07,988 --> 00:40:10,907
He didn't just fail
to eradicate a bedbug infestation.

860
00:40:11,033 --> 00:40:12,867
He actually created one.

861
00:40:12,993 --> 00:40:15,537
Yeah, he pulled the carpet
from one of his old buildings,

862
00:40:15,663 --> 00:40:17,539
carpet that was already infested,

863
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:20,708
and then, he re-installed it in
my client's apartment to drive him out.

864
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:21,793
That's crazy.

865
00:40:21,919 --> 00:40:24,003
You might want to warn your client
about perjury.

866
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:26,297
We've got sworn testimony
from the installer.

867
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:29,217
And a picture
of the same carpet

868
00:40:29,343 --> 00:40:32,887
from one of his old buildings
before it was renovated.

869
00:40:33,013 --> 00:40:35,765
By the way, my wife and I really love
what you've done with the place.

870
00:40:36,809 --> 00:40:38,935
So, it looks like
we're talking about, what,

871
00:40:39,061 --> 00:40:43,231
assault, violations of rental codes,
health codes,

872
00:40:43,357 --> 00:40:46,985
and you know,
just basic codes of human decency.

873
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:48,778
And if a jury in New York
heard all that?

874
00:40:48,904 --> 00:40:50,238
Wow. Imagine the damages.

875
00:40:50,364 --> 00:40:52,031
Harvey, spectate. Please.

876
00:40:52,158 --> 00:40:53,950
Just get that carpet
out of here.

877
00:40:54,076 --> 00:40:55,952
So, Vivien,

878
00:40:56,078 --> 00:40:58,037
how am I doing
for my first time?

879
00:40:58,497 --> 00:41:00,707
This still counts
as my first time, doesn't it?

880
00:41:02,918 --> 00:41:05,837
Now, let's talk about
how much this is going to cost you.

881
00:41:17,016 --> 00:41:18,266
Yes?

882
00:41:18,392 --> 00:41:19,642
Just thought
you'd like to know.

883
00:41:19,768 --> 00:41:21,561
Your case,
the pro bono?

884
00:41:22,021 --> 00:41:22,854
I won.

885
00:41:23,564 --> 00:41:24,772
How exciting for you.

886
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:26,191
But like I said,
it's just a pro bono case.

887
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:27,567
It's not going
to help your career.

888
00:41:27,693 --> 00:41:29,486
I did also manage
to sign 15 new clients

889
00:41:29,612 --> 00:41:31,154
who are all suing
for the same harassment.

890
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:34,866
And they will be paying.
So, you can multiply this number

891
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:36,409
times 15.

892
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:39,954
That's not bad
for Rookie League.

893
00:41:43,459 --> 00:41:46,169
Come on. Tell me that wasn't worth
missing your lunch hour for.

894
00:41:46,295 --> 00:41:48,713
Mmm.
Makes me proud to be your wife.

895
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:50,256
Oh. Yeah, wait.
What is this coming up?

896
00:41:50,382 --> 00:41:52,383
Is that our third
or our fourth anniversary?

897
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:53,384
- It's our fifth.
- Ah.

898
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:54,719
Doesn't it mean
anything to you?

899
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:58,097
Yeah. In fact, I think that we should
have a date night and celebrate.

900
00:41:58,224 --> 00:41:59,766
- You're funny.
- Hey.

901
00:42:00,809 --> 00:42:02,435
I'm serious.

902
00:42:10,402 --> 00:42:12,487
I can't date anyone
from the office.
