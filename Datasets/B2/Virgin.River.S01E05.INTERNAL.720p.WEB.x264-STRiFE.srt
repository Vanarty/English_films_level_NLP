1
00:00:08,466 --> 00:00:09,506
Get in the truck.

2
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:11,090
I got a better idea.

3
00:00:11,177 --> 00:00:12,977
Why don't you get in the truck
and drive away?

4
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:14,933
Not without her, I don't.

5
00:00:16,266 --> 00:00:18,516
That a LS 9mm Taggart?

6
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,020
Yeah.

7
00:00:21,604 --> 00:00:22,604
So, what?

8
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:24,571
You'd be better off
throwin' that thing at me.

9
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:26,610
- Why don't you shut up?
- Or what?

10
00:00:29,487 --> 00:00:30,697
You gonna shoot me?

11
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:32,281
Yeah.

12
00:00:33,324 --> 00:00:34,414
That's far enough.

13
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:40,578
You're gonna need more than one bullet
to stop me.

14
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:43,921
Put my mind to it,
I don't need a gun to stop you.

15
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:48,342
Hey. Let's everybody just calm down, okay?

16
00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:50,023
If somebody's sick, I wanna go and help.

17
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:52,720
- Mel, we're not...
- No, I'm only going with Jack.

18
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:54,853
Boss doesn't like visitors.

19
00:00:54,929 --> 00:00:57,599
Yeah, well, I don't like guns being waved
in my face.

20
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:01,389
We can stand around
threatening each other, or we can go.

21
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:09,568
Get in the truck.

22
00:01:41,309 --> 00:01:43,229
Hell's bells, what's going on in here?

23
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:46,273
Only me and Brady are working
the front of the house tonight.

24
00:01:47,148 --> 00:01:48,688
Nobody answering the phone?

25
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:50,685
Yeah, sorry.
We're kind of slammed right now.

26
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:52,487
Well, I was calling to get the specials.

27
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:53,570
No specials.

28
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:55,782
Well, then I'll take the meatloaf.

29
00:01:56,407 --> 00:01:57,407
To go.

30
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:00,996
Where's Jack?

31
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:04,209
Uh, he and Mel blew a tire
on the way to Myrtle Farms.

32
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:05,290
They don't have a spare.

33
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:08,416
Good God, I'll drive out and pick 'em up.

34
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:10,513
No. You just got out of the hospital.

35
00:02:10,588 --> 00:02:12,168
I passed my stress test.

36
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:14,967
I am free to resume my regular activities.

37
00:02:15,051 --> 00:02:17,971
Well, meddlin' in other people's business
is not an activity.

38
00:02:18,054 --> 00:02:19,434
It is an annoyance.

39
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:21,766
I'll drive that spare up there myself.

40
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:24,140
Not necessary.
Jack already ordered a tow truck.

41
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:26,691
Oh, well,
then I guess we don't have a problem.

42
00:02:26,771 --> 00:02:29,021
- He said it'd take a while.
- Where's Preacher?

43
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:30,857
Uh, he's, uh, in West Virginia.

44
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:32,822
His parents' basement flooded
or something.

45
00:02:32,902 --> 00:02:34,572
He's gonna be back in a couple days.

46
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:38,874
What are you doing?

47
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:41,830
Pitching in. But don't worry,
you can still take your meatloaf to go.

48
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:44,289
I figure I'll... I'll eat it here.

49
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:46,882
There's a table for one
in the corner.

50
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:48,458
Here.

51
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:49,877
Hi.

52
00:02:50,044 --> 00:02:53,014
Has anyone heard from Jack?
My calls are going straight to voice mail.

53
00:02:53,923 --> 00:02:56,223
He and Mel got a flat
on the way to Myrtle Farms.

54
00:02:57,093 --> 00:02:57,973
Oh.

55
00:02:58,052 --> 00:02:59,602
What... what are they doing out there?

56
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:01,681
Who knows? But the tow truck's on its way.

57
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:03,387
Okay. Hey.

58
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:05,267
I'll just wait here, then.

59
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:06,810
Might be a while.

60
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:08,482
I don't mind.

61
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:11,074
Can I have a white Zinfandel?

62
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:13,109
You can, but why would you want to?

63
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:14,863
Because it's delicious.

64
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:49,601
Jimmy's back.

65
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:50,896
All right.

66
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:19,258
Stay here.

67
00:04:32,563 --> 00:04:33,613
Where are we?

68
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:37,153
This is an illegal growers' camp.

69
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:42,781
Where's the pot?

70
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:46,366
They grow it underground
in shipping containers.

71
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:49,455
The police don't do anything?

72
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:53,961
Well, they would, but most grows like
this one are actually inside state parks.

73
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:56,504
Falls under
the Department of Fish and Wildlife.

74
00:04:56,587 --> 00:04:59,587
There's just not enough wardens
to patrol all the land.

75
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:02,465
We just try to stay clear of 'em.

76
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:07,641
I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean to get you into this.

77
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:12,064
Well, the other option was to watch you
drive away with a gun-toting maniac, so...

78
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:17,654
Listen, we're just gonna go in there,
you'll take care of whoever needs help,

79
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:19,134
and then we'll be on our way, okay?

80
00:05:19,193 --> 00:05:20,573
- All right. Yeah.
- Just breathe.

81
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:24,197
Oh, I thought I was breathing.

82
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:28,157
Look, I'm not gonna let anything
happen to you.

83
00:05:33,207 --> 00:05:34,207
Come on.

84
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:35,424
- Let's go.
- No, not you.

85
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:37,797
Where she goes, I go.

86
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,399
Who are you?

87
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:01,359
I'm Mel. I'm a nurse.

88
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:03,074
I told you idiots to bring Doc.

89
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:04,864
It wasn't me. It was Jimmy.

90
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:07,163
Come on, Jimmy. What the hell?

91
00:06:07,241 --> 00:06:09,791
- I went to get Doc. I got her instead.
- Ow.

92
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,910
Ow!

93
00:06:14,123 --> 00:06:17,173
- What's he doing here?
- She wouldn't come without him.

94
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:18,842
Get them out of here.

95
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:21,357
The bullet went through,
and there's a clear exit wound.

96
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:23,931
- It looks like a .22 hollow point.
- You know your guns.

97
00:06:24,008 --> 00:06:26,548
No, I know my bullets.
I need a tourniquet.

98
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:27,636
- Oh...
- Here.

99
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:32,312
Listen, you lost a lot of blood.
You need to go to a hospital.

100
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:35,022
Gunshot wounds
get reported to the police.

101
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:38,273
- Well, you need a surgeon.
- Won't this stop the bleeding?

102
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:41,401
This is a temporary fix.

103
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:43,534
Look, just fix me up, then you can leave.

104
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:46,321
I don't have any supplies.
I don't have any equipment. I can't.

105
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:49,616
- Take them to the provisions shack.
- Yep. Let's go.

106
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,240
Follow me.

107
00:06:51,327 --> 00:06:52,327
Okay.

108
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:56,038
You need to push pressure on this.

109
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:16,596
Hurry up. Make it snappy.

110
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:21,150
Where do they get all this stuff?

111
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:23,732
Well, I think Doc
leaves whatever he can behind.

112
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:26,649
How often is he here?

113
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:28,528
Once or twice a month.

114
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:32,620
Look, that bullet
could have nicked an artery.

115
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:35,792
You're just gonna do whatever you can,
and then we're gonna go, okay?

116
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:37,996
I can't guarantee he's not gonna die.

117
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:46,423
- Clear?
- Okay.

118
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:47,931
Whoa, I need those menus.

119
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:49,219
- Uh, yeah. Okay.
- Yeah.

120
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:58,095
- Hey, this goes to that lady right there.
- Which one?

121
00:07:58,186 --> 00:07:59,580
- That one, right there.
- Excuse me.

122
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:01,234
- Excuse me!
- Yes! Mm-hm.

123
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:03,317
We ordered our food an hour ago.

124
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:05,739
- What did you order?
- Elk stew and two beers.

125
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:08,068
Oh, I'm sorry, folks. We're out of stew.

126
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:09,074
How did that happen?

127
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:11,115
An hour ago we had stew.
How about a burger?

128
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,989
I don't want a burger.
I want what I ordered.

129
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:16,285
How'd you like that burger cooked?
I'd suggest, uh, medium well.

130
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:17,710
These are on the house.

131
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:19,871
- Thank you.
- No problem.

132
00:08:19,957 --> 00:08:21,517
And I'll go check on that stew for you.

133
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:24,956
Honey, this is a business.
There are no freebies.

134
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:27,546
Well, there are when it comes
to making the customers happy.

135
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:29,272
Ugh. This isn't one of your bad haircuts.

136
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:32,470
Getting a burger instead of stew
isn't gonna ruin anyone's day.

137
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:36,473
I'm considered one of Clear River's
most sought-after stylists.

138
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:39,307
Congratulations.
Anyway, we're out of stew.

139
00:08:39,393 --> 00:08:41,403
Well, Preacher keeps a stash
in the walk-in

140
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:42,399
- for emergencies.
- Whoa!

141
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,110
- Oh, Brady.
- I'm sorry. I'll...

142
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:47,034
- clean it up in a bit, okay?
- What?

143
00:08:47,109 --> 00:08:49,229
Preacher keeps a stash
in the walk-in for emergencies.

144
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:51,108
Then go and get it.

145
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:53,487
Yeah, that's what I was just doing.

146
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:57,945
Sure looks like you could use some help.

147
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:00,327
You focus
on getting our divorce finalized.

148
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:02,584
Yeah, number one on my to-do list.

149
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:04,419
I found the stew.

150
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,800
I'm gonna get that
right out for you guys, okay?

151
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,260
It'll be just five minutes.

152
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:12,222
What is your beef with Charmaine?

153
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:13,341
She's fine in small doses,

154
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:16,306
but I've seen too much of her
in the last two days, I've had my fill.

155
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:19,269
Can you just stop meddling
in other people's business?

156
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:20,770
She's wrong for Jack.

157
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:22,141
That is not for you to say.

158
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:23,228
Says who?

159
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:26,229
Well, I'm guessin' Charmaine and Jack.

160
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:27,565
Ughh!

161
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:39,077
Okay.

162
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:45,287
- Okay?
- Oh, damn it. Damn it.

163
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:47,206
Damn it.

164
00:09:53,217 --> 00:09:54,457
So, what's the move?

165
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:56,590
We can't leave the tourniquet
on more than two hours.

166
00:09:56,637 --> 00:09:58,557
It'll cut off circulation
to the rest of his leg.

167
00:09:58,598 --> 00:09:59,518
Sew him up.

168
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,889
I can't sew him up.
We don't have the equipment.

169
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:05,016
Even if we did, he could end up with
a massive infection that could kill him.

170
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:10,229
If he loses much more blood,
he's not gonna survive.

171
00:10:11,235 --> 00:10:14,695
Once he passes out, I think I can get
the other guys to get him to the hospital.

172
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:17,323
It's too late for that.
He'll bleed out on the way.

173
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:19,116
What are you two whispering about there?

174
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:23,370
I need a knife.

175
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:33,592
- We're almost there.
- Okay, great.

176
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:35,184
- You good?
- Yep. I'm good.

177
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:37,639
Okay, I need him to stay still.

178
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,810
He can't move his leg until I'm finished.

179
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:43,890
When I'm done,
I need you to pour saline and then alcohol

180
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:45,226
to sterilize the wound, okay?

181
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:46,981
- Yep.
- Got it? Saline and then alcohol.

182
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:49,193
- Yeah, I got it.
- What are you doin' now?

183
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:51,533
- I need to stop the bleeding.
- By burnin' him?

184
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:54,278
- Do you want him to die?
- No.

185
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:56,454
Okay, then do what I say.

186
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,699
Okay, great. Can you hold down his legs?

187
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:03,250
- Ready?
- Yep.

188
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:04,329
Okay.

189
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:06,247
Okay. Hold him down.

190
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:08,958
Okay.

191
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:40,532
Jack?

192
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:51,793
Jack?

193
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:04,966
Jack's Bar.

194
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:05,977
Is Jack there?

195
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:07,388
What's that? I can't hear you.

196
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:10,102
I found Jack's truck but not Jack.

197
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,980
- We need three more burgers right now.
- Yeah.

198
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:14,565
Man, Jack's not here, okay?

199
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:16,443
Hello?

200
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:28,825
Oww!

201
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:30,976
- Oof.
- You need to keep this clean and dry,

202
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,500
otherwise the wound could open up
and start bleeding again, okay?

203
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:36,837
We'll send Doc back up
as soon as we get to town.

204
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:40,802
What happened, man?

205
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:44,097
Between the blood loss and the pain,
he probably just passed out.

206
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:49,063
Look, if you care about him at all,
you need to take him to a hospital.

207
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:51,983
Come on. Just drop us at the main road,
and we can flag down a car.

208
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:55,442
Like you said, he might keep bleeding.
Then there'll be nobody to look after him.

209
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:57,493
I've done all I can do.

210
00:12:57,568 --> 00:12:59,328
Well, let's just wait
until tomorrow morning,

211
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:01,491
- see how he's doing.
- That's not part of the deal.

212
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:04,662
Okay, no, she came to fix him,
and that's what she's gonna do.

213
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:07,542
And then if anything happens,
it's on you two.

214
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:17,757
There's a decent chance
he's not gonna make it through the night.

215
00:13:47,701 --> 00:13:48,831
Here you go.

216
00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:51,287
Nighty night.

217
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,836
What do you think they're gonna
do to us if he dies?

218
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:59,130
Well, he's alive now.
Let's just focus on that.

219
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:04,048
I thought somebody had the flu,
or food poisoning, or something.

220
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:08,432
I'm so sorry
I dragged you into this.

221
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:10,932
Come on. What, did you think
I was gonna let you just...

222
00:14:11,475 --> 00:14:13,115
run off and have all the fun on your own?

223
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:15,228
Here.

224
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:16,685
Thanks.

225
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:18,112
Here, you take this.

226
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:20,936
But what about you? You're shivering.

227
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:25,244
My mother raised me right.

228
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:31,749
I thought I was leaving gunshot wounds
and stabbings back in LA.

229
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:34,918
Well, even Virgin River isn't perfect.

230
00:14:37,501 --> 00:14:39,671
Yeah, see, but it was supposed to be.

231
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:42,014
Come on. What is, though?

232
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:46,134
You okay?

233
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:49,888
Yeah, I just...
I have a little shrapnel in there.

234
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:55,685
When it's cold like this,
it hurts like hell.

235
00:14:57,688 --> 00:14:59,438
You know, you can get that removed.

236
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:06,323
Well, it's funny. You know, all the...

237
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:09,115
scars and the...

238
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:13,038
the bullet fragments, they're like a map.

239
00:15:15,122 --> 00:15:16,582
Kind of tells a story.

240
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:23,264
Plus, it makes it so I don't ever forget
just how lucky I am to still be alive.

241
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:27,835
You know, some of the guys I served with
aren't so lucky.

242
00:15:31,513 --> 00:15:32,643
Where did it happen?

243
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:36,767
Uh, it was Kandahar.

244
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:39,729
Sniper.

245
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:47,742
This little guy... Check it out.

246
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:49,655
- Oof.
- Mm.

247
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,080
That was Baghdad.

248
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:53,489
- Ouch.
- Grenade.

249
00:15:56,914 --> 00:16:00,044
What about the one on your back?
It's a really big scar.

250
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:02,588
It was, um...

251
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:06,514
Mosul, uh...

252
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:10,009
Mosul.

253
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:21,555
Ooh.

254
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:24,687
Two screws and a plate.

255
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:27,568
Let me guess.

256
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:28,991
You were skiing?

257
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:31,195
Snowboarding? Surfin', huh?

258
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:35,491
Mm-hm. Oh, just
a 300-pound schizophrenic high on PCP.

259
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:39,787
- Oh, that was my next guess, yeah.
- Yeah.

260
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:45,382
It took two guards and 50 ccs of Haldol
to pry him off of me.

261
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:53,347
Wow, look at us, huh?

262
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:56,929
Just two vets sittin' around a campfire
swappin' war stories.

263
00:16:57,224 --> 00:16:58,224
Hm!

264
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:03,652
You should get some sleep.

265
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:07,355
What about you?

266
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:09,453
I'm gonna keep watch.

267
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:18,369
Nightcap?

268
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:19,829
Yeah.

269
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:24,381
Now all I need is a mint on my pillow.

270
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:26,752
And a pillow.

271
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:39,305
You're not gonna have any?

272
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:42,234
I'm on duty, ma'am.

273
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:45,438
Here.

274
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:50,990
You're gonna freeze.

275
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:04,076
Has anyone heard from Jack or Mel?

276
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:06,876
Nothing here.

277
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:09,841
They would have had to drop the truck off
at the auto shop.

278
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:11,802
I'm sure they'll be back shortly.

279
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:15,798
- You guys can close up without me, right?
- Huh!

280
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:24,731
Look what the cat dragged in.

281
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:28,274
- Thought you might need help closin'.
- That's sweet of you.

282
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:29,567
Well, thanks.

283
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:32,649
Looks like you inherited
your mother's soft spot for Doc.

284
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:37,906
There's probably something I should do
in the kitchen.

285
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:48,785
I know I said I'd stay and wait for Jack,
but, um, it's getting late, so...

286
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:51,881
Tell him I was here?

287
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:53,669
- I will.
- Thanks.

288
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:55,468
- Good night.
- Good night.

289
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:03,224
What?

290
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:06,271
I didn't say anything that isn't true.

291
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:07,854
Unbelievable.

292
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:13,567
Is your attitude about Charmaine,
is it really from that night 20 years ago?

293
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:17,158
Charmaine is not the one who hurt you.

294
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:19,365
You're right.

295
00:19:21,618 --> 00:19:24,288
Technically, it was her mother
who destroyed our marriage.

296
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:25,501
Hope...

297
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:29,542
we've gone over this and over this.

298
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:33,053
The night that young boy died...

299
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:35,843
I was devastated, I was...

300
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:37,930
I was not myself.

301
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:41,904
Hell, I was thinkin' about going back
to the hospital in Seattle.

302
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:44,350
You think that wasn't a devastating time
for me?

303
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:45,603
I never said it wasn't.

304
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:50,689
But you didn't see me falling into bed
with some floozy or trying to run away.

305
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:54,477
I didn't run away.

306
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:56,110
I didn't leave.

307
00:19:57,863 --> 00:20:00,953
Seattle is where I was from.
Virgin River is my home.

308
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:04,787
You gave me that.

309
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:07,833
And I love this place, and I...

310
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:11,292
I love you.

311
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:16,051
And I know I made a terrible mistake.

312
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:19,126
And I've apologized.

313
00:20:20,677 --> 00:20:22,297
Why can't you just let it go?

314
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:25,307
You just don't get it.

315
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:27,975
I don't. I don't.

316
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,980
Can you just explain it?

317
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:34,319
If you haven't gotten it by now,
you never will.

318
00:20:58,465 --> 00:20:59,465
You snore.

319
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:03,385
- I don't snore.
- Mm-hm.

320
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:05,184
Like a lumberjack.

321
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:08,184
Stop. Don't exaggerate.

322
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:10,937
No, I'm talking
Bose stereo surround sound.

323
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:12,819
For a minute,
I thought there were two of you.

324
00:21:13,563 --> 00:21:14,653
Calvin's awake.

325
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:17,605
Come take a look.

326
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:34,578
- Hello?
- Hi. Is this Hope McCrea?

327
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:36,708
Not if you're trying to sell me something,
it isn't.

328
00:21:36,753 --> 00:21:39,013
No, please don't hang up.
I'm looking for Mel.

329
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:41,126
- Mel Monroe.
- Who is this?

330
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:43,296
It's her sister, Joey Barnes.

331
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:44,545
Oh, hello.

332
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:47,137
I'm just wondering
if you know where Mel is.

333
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:48,852
Not right this minute, I don't.

334
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:50,601
Is everything all right?

335
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:53,871
I've been trying to call since last night.
I haven't been able to reach her.

336
00:21:53,895 --> 00:21:56,685
It is just not like her
to be out of touch for so long.

337
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:03,410
Well, there's no obvious signs
of an infection,

338
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:05,367
but it could take a few days to present.

339
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:08,868
So?

340
00:22:09,703 --> 00:22:11,783
So, considering everything,
you're lucky to be alive.

341
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:13,866
So, I'm in the clear.

342
00:22:13,957 --> 00:22:15,077
No. You're not in the clear.

343
00:22:15,917 --> 00:22:20,047
You don't have a fever now,
but you need to stay on top of this.

344
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:22,880
You need to change the dressing
two or three times a day.

345
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:26,466
If there's any redness or swelling,
or you see any discharge,

346
00:22:26,553 --> 00:22:27,853
you need to go to the hospital.

347
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:32,636
So, I guess we can go now.

348
00:22:35,645 --> 00:22:36,925
Take them to their truck, Jimmy.

349
00:22:39,649 --> 00:22:40,939
All right, boss.

350
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:42,026
You're welcome.

351
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:00,054
Hey. Hey!

352
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:02,630
Hey, stop. You can't go in there.

353
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:07,589
Uh... Help her. Please. Okay? Just...

354
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:13,135
Hi, there. Hi.

355
00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:16,139
- What's your name?
- Maxine.

356
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:17,728
Maxine, my name is Mel.

357
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:20,152
I'm a nurse and a midwife.

358
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:21,232
Okay?

359
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:23,360
How long have you been in labor?

360
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:25,034
I don't know. Um...

361
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:26,412
a few hours.

362
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:29,409
She's, uh, been pushing,
but nothing's happening.

363
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:30,491
Okay.

364
00:23:31,451 --> 00:23:32,451
Okay.

365
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:35,832
Sh. It's okay.

366
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:37,504
Try to breathe, okay?

367
00:23:39,334 --> 00:23:41,554
I'm gonna help you deliver the baby, okay?

368
00:23:41,628 --> 00:23:42,918
It's not time yet.

369
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:44,588
Okay.

370
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:47,844
It's gonna be okay.
I'm just gonna check you out.

371
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:50,428
Okay.

372
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:53,309
Your water has broken,
and you're fully dilated.

373
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:54,430
That means that it's time.

374
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:56,142
Okay?

375
00:23:57,686 --> 00:23:58,936
That's good. That's good.

376
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:00,901
That's good. That's good, okay?

377
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,320
Damn it.

378
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:04,149
What? What is it?

379
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,570
Okay, listen.

380
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:11,122
Your baby's in a breech position.
Do you know what that means?

381
00:24:13,743 --> 00:24:16,833
Okay, it means that the baby
is coming out backwards, feet first.

382
00:24:16,913 --> 00:24:18,213
It's gonna be fine.

383
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:20,630
I just need you not to push
during your next contraction.

384
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:22,589
Do you understand? Okay?

385
00:24:22,669 --> 00:24:26,419
Just keep breathing deep breaths
and don't push until I tell you to. Okay?

386
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:30,301
It's okay. Just don't push, okay?
You got this.

387
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:36,269
Okay, I'm gonna need lots
of clean towels...

388
00:24:37,267 --> 00:24:38,267
hot water...

389
00:24:40,103 --> 00:24:41,813
scissors, and alcohol.

390
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:50,815
Calvin says you guys gotta go.
You gotta go.

391
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:52,196
Are you kidding me?

392
00:24:53,867 --> 00:24:56,197
We are 50 miles from the nearest hospital.

393
00:24:56,286 --> 00:24:58,456
She's having a breech delivery.

394
00:24:58,538 --> 00:25:00,819
I am the only one here
who knows how to deliver this baby,

395
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:02,084
so you need to back off.

396
00:25:03,793 --> 00:25:06,133
You really want a dead baby
on your conscience?

397
00:25:07,714 --> 00:25:10,304
If you don't have a job here,
you don't belong here.

398
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:12,696
Okay. You're gonna be okay.

399
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:14,361
Lead the way.
Show me where the stuff is.

400
00:25:14,429 --> 00:25:15,948
- You got it.
- Come on, it's all right.

401
00:25:15,972 --> 00:25:17,972
We've got it. I've got her. I've got her.

402
00:25:18,433 --> 00:25:20,853
Hey, look at me. It's okay.

403
00:25:21,478 --> 00:25:23,308
Just try to take deep breaths, okay?

404
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:27,942
That's better.

405
00:25:28,818 --> 00:25:30,818
Yeah, you too.
But, listen, you call me.

406
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:33,244
Call me if you hear anything, right?

407
00:25:34,115 --> 00:25:35,615
Okay. Thanks, Bert.

408
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:47,172
Have you heard from Mel or Jack?

409
00:25:47,754 --> 00:25:51,264
No. No. Bert found Jack's truck abandoned
on the side of the road.

410
00:25:51,341 --> 00:25:52,681
No sign of Mel or Jack.

411
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:56,179
Bert, he left me a message last night, and
hell, I didn't get it until this morning.

412
00:25:56,263 --> 00:25:57,313
Mel's sister called me.

413
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:59,349
She hasn't heard from Mel since yesterday.

414
00:25:59,432 --> 00:26:02,102
And Jo Ellen told me
Mel never came home last night.

415
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:05,309
- Maybe we should call the sheriff.
- Already did. He's in Fortuna.

416
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:07,357
Won't be back here for a few hours.

417
00:26:08,024 --> 00:26:09,194
I'm gonna go look for them.

418
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:11,276
There's only one road
that leads to Myrtle Farms.

419
00:26:11,361 --> 00:26:13,441
- I'm coming with you.
- Oh, no. You're staying here.

420
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:16,620
We... Someone has to help Brady at the bar.

421
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:20,290
And as I recall, only one of us
recently had a heart attack.

422
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:22,620
I will call you if I find them.

423
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:24,416
You mean when you find them.

424
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:27,841
Yeah.

425
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:37,391
- You're doing great.
- Hey.

426
00:26:37,887 --> 00:26:38,927
Oh!

427
00:26:39,889 --> 00:26:40,889
Just in time.

428
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:43,063
Okay, just keep breathing.

429
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:45,233
- Is she okay?
- Yeah, she's doing great.

430
00:26:45,312 --> 00:26:48,692
Hey, how you doing? Hey, hey.
We're back, okay?

431
00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:52,149
Baby's leg is wrapped around.
She should be having a C-section.

432
00:26:53,153 --> 00:26:54,653
So, what's Plan B?

433
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:56,868
The same as Plan A. Deliver the baby.

434
00:26:59,534 --> 00:27:02,374
Okay. Maxine, I'm gonna need you
to get on all fours.

435
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:03,934
- Okay?
- I don't think I can do that.

436
00:27:03,997 --> 00:27:05,327
Uh, does she have to?

437
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:08,245
We need gravity to help us here.

438
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:10,455
I feel like I can't move.

439
00:27:10,545 --> 00:27:12,955
I know, it's... it's totally normal.

440
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:15,008
Your body's going through a lot right now,
okay?

441
00:27:15,425 --> 00:27:17,545
- It's okay. It's gonna be okay.
- Okay.

442
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:19,316
- All right, on my count.
- Okay.

443
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:22,524
One, two, three.

444
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:24,349
You got it.

445
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:25,693
There you go.

446
00:27:26,353 --> 00:27:28,233
Okay. Hey, Spencer,
why don't you come over here

447
00:27:28,271 --> 00:27:30,651
- and support her from the front?
- Yeah, sure.

448
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:31,652
Okay.

449
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:34,113
Hey, hey. I'm gonna come up here, okay?

450
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:35,986
It's okay. See?

451
00:27:36,529 --> 00:27:38,159
- Okay.
- There you go. Good girl.

452
00:27:38,239 --> 00:27:40,619
Listen, listen. There you go.

453
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,160
Look at you. Look at you.

454
00:27:42,535 --> 00:27:44,695
All right.

455
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:45,788
You got it.

456
00:28:25,912 --> 00:28:26,912
Damn it.

457
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:29,123
Damn it.

458
00:28:36,339 --> 00:28:37,719
- All right.
- It's okay.

459
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:42,009
All right. With this next contraction,
you can go ahead and start pushing, okay?

460
00:28:42,095 --> 00:28:44,885
- Okay. You're doing great. You got this.
- Take a deep breath in.

461
00:28:45,473 --> 00:28:46,853
- You got it.
- You got it.

462
00:28:50,353 --> 00:28:51,403
All right, here we go.

463
00:28:51,479 --> 00:28:52,479
Here we go.

464
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:56,783
- You're doing great.
- Okay, the legs are out.

465
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,400
Good job. Okay?

466
00:28:58,486 --> 00:28:59,486
Okay?

467
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:02,664
- Oh, it's a boy.
- It's a boy.

468
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:04,031
Did you hear that, babe?

469
00:29:04,534 --> 00:29:05,584
It's... it's a boy.

470
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:07,371
It's a boy.

471
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:10,166
Okay.
Now I have to get the head out.

472
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:13,038
I'm gonna have to... I'm gonna
have to put my hand up in there,

473
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:15,036
and you're gonna feel some pressure,
okay?

474
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:19,590
Oh, boy.

475
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:21,295
You all right there, cowboy?

476
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:23,093
Yeah.

477
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:27,273
Okay. With this next contraction,
I want you to push like hell, okay?

478
00:29:28,057 --> 00:29:29,952
- You can do it.
- Come on. You got one more time.

479
00:29:29,976 --> 00:29:31,576
- Take a deep breath.
- You got it, baby.

480
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:34,314
- You got it.
- One more. One more.

481
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:39,109
Okay.

482
00:29:39,986 --> 00:29:40,986
You got it.

483
00:29:41,821 --> 00:29:43,531
Okay. He's out.

484
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:47,581
Okay. Okay.

485
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:51,793
- You did good.
- Yeah. Okay.

486
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:52,873
There we go.

487
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:55,078
Oh, hi.

488
00:29:55,668 --> 00:29:57,588
Hey, there, little man.

489
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:00,217
Welcome to the world.

490
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:01,930
I want to see him.

491
00:30:02,008 --> 00:30:03,378
I want to see my son.

492
00:30:05,011 --> 00:30:06,511
He's okay.

493
00:30:06,596 --> 00:30:08,096
Here. Here, here, here.

494
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,350
Slow, slow, slow.

495
00:30:10,433 --> 00:30:11,893
- Hold that.
- Here you go.

496
00:30:13,853 --> 00:30:15,273

Doc called. Said, uh...
Mel and Jack are missing.

516
00:31:42,358 --> 00:31:45,188
I'm just gonna stick around here
until we hear something.

517
00:31:45,445 --> 00:31:49,155
Well, uh, since you're here, uh,
Brady could use your help at the bar.

518
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,620
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

519
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:52,659
- Hm.
- Uh...

520
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:54,254
I think first, though...

521
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:58,326
I think you and I need
to have a little talk.

522
00:32:01,794 --> 00:32:04,014
I know about my mother and Doc.

523
00:32:04,631 --> 00:32:07,221
Not surprised.
Everybody in town knew before I did.

524
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,890
That must have been horrible.

525
00:32:08,968 --> 00:32:09,968
Wasn't great.

526
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:13,640
Especially since the two of you
were such good friends.

527
00:32:14,223 --> 00:32:15,063
Some friend.

528
00:32:15,141 --> 00:32:16,731
Hm. Yeah.

529
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:21,153
You look just like her.

530
00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:24,399
I know...

531
00:32:26,653 --> 00:32:28,073
but I'm not her.

532
00:32:32,867 --> 00:32:34,367
I am so sorry...

533
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:37,908
she came between you and Doc, I really am.

534
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:41,826
But I can't change my family tree.

535
00:32:45,755 --> 00:32:47,835
I suppose everyone
has someone in their family

536
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:50,094
they wish had sprung from another orchard.

537
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:53,303
Yeah.

538
00:32:54,514 --> 00:32:56,644
Um... I'm gonna get back to it.

539
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:05,022
And thank you.

540
00:33:05,608 --> 00:33:06,608
For what?

541
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:08,492
For hearing me out.

542
00:33:13,574 --> 00:33:14,624
You're welcome.

543
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:26,712
Hey!

544
00:33:28,589 --> 00:33:29,919
Where are you going with them?

545
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:34,104
I'm taking Maxine and the baby
to the hospital.

546
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:35,928
Spencer, you're not going anywhere.

547
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:38,274
He's coming with his family.

548
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:39,850
Not gonna happen.

549
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:43,557
Maxine, you wanna see him again,
you know where he is.

550
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:46,519
I don't want to go alone.

551
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:48,478
Enough with this insanity.

552
00:33:49,444 --> 00:33:52,364
Uh... Calvin is a grown man
who can make his own dumb decisions,

553
00:33:52,447 --> 00:33:56,487
but Maxine and this baby are my patients,
and I am taking them to the hospital.

554
00:33:56,576 --> 00:33:57,576
All right, we're leaving.

555
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:59,120
Jimmy!

556
00:34:05,793 --> 00:34:06,843
Maxine.

557
00:34:06,919 --> 00:34:08,919
Yeah. Sorry we lied.

558
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:11,184
Calvin didn't want you
to know she was here.

559
00:34:12,925 --> 00:34:14,295
She had a breech birth.

560
00:34:14,927 --> 00:34:17,927
Mom and baby seem to be doing well,
but we need to get them to the hospital.

561
00:34:18,014 --> 00:34:19,024
Yeah.

562
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:21,601
Well, let's go get in my truck.

563
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,560
Hey!

564
00:34:23,811 --> 00:34:24,981
They can't leave.

565
00:34:26,022 --> 00:34:28,612
Well, then, I'll just have
to send the sheriff later.

566
00:34:29,817 --> 00:34:32,447
- We had an understanding, Doc.
- Yeah, we do, Calvin.

567
00:34:35,281 --> 00:34:37,701
I turn a blind eye
to your drug business...

568
00:34:38,701 --> 00:34:42,161
and in exchange, you let me treat
all the people who live here in this camp.

569
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:43,866
No one's leavin' here.

570
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:49,134
Calvin, you don't hold up
your end of the bargain,

571
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:50,302
I won't hold up mine.

572
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,090
Are you threatenin' me, Doc?

573
00:34:52,965 --> 00:34:54,215
I'm just statin' facts.

574
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:57,010
Now, just let us all go down
to the hospital,

575
00:34:57,095 --> 00:35:00,215
and I give you my word
this will not lead back to you.

576
00:35:01,557 --> 00:35:03,597
You've always been a smart man, Calvin.

577
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:06,272
Don't go dumb on me now.

578
00:35:08,314 --> 00:35:09,614
Stop.

579
00:35:13,069 --> 00:35:15,399
You take the woman and the child.
Spencer...

580
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:17,994
you're stayin' here.

581
00:35:21,702 --> 00:35:22,702
It's okay.

582
00:35:23,412 --> 00:35:25,082
Take care of Maxine and my son.

583
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:28,076
It's okay. Go.

584
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:31,962
Jack?

585
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:35,048
I'll be seeing you two.

586
00:35:39,345 --> 00:35:40,345
Come on.

587
00:36:12,211 --> 00:36:14,171
Where'd everybody go?

588
00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:16,536
I called Hope from the hospital.

589
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:20,221
I just told her to close up
and send everybody home.

590
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:25,894
I've completely lost track
of time and space.

591
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:29,440
Well...

592
00:36:31,564 --> 00:36:32,774
I think this will help.

593
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:43,413
You know, you're safe here.

594
00:36:43,492 --> 00:36:45,082
Yeah, I know. I need to just...

595
00:36:46,412 --> 00:36:48,412
make my body catch up to my head.

596
00:36:54,295 --> 00:36:56,705
You know,
I think you perform better under pressure

597
00:36:56,797 --> 00:36:58,547
than some Special Forces guys I know.

598
00:36:59,675 --> 00:37:00,675
Really?

599
00:37:01,135 --> 00:37:02,215
Mm.

600
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:07,599
Did you call your sister?

601
00:37:07,975 --> 00:37:09,515
Yeah, when you were on with Hope.

602
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:14,483
You must be exhausted.

603
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:18,073
You know, actually, I'm... starved.

604
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:20,070
Me too.

605
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:23,319
There's only one thing I know how to make.

606
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:24,658
That's steak.

607
00:37:25,034 --> 00:37:26,954
I will take mine medium rare.

608
00:37:28,204 --> 00:37:30,214
- All right.
- Now I just need a...

609
00:37:30,289 --> 00:37:32,209
vodka martini with a twist.

610
00:37:37,046 --> 00:37:38,046
Or that.

611
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:42,385
What should we toast to?

612
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:44,636
Being home.

613
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:04,784
- You're back.
- Yeah.

614
00:38:04,865 --> 00:38:06,445
- Told you you'd find 'em.
- Yeah.

615
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:08,159
Come on in.

616
00:38:12,164 --> 00:38:13,584
I found another attorney.

617
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:16,585
I scheduled a call with him
for tomorrow morning.

618
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:20,421
- Okay, then.
- No, you were right.

619
00:38:21,173 --> 00:38:23,303
Twenty years of separation.

620
00:38:25,052 --> 00:38:26,102
That's enough.

621
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:29,175
It's time for both of us just to...

622
00:38:30,057 --> 00:38:31,097
go our own way.

623
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:02,301
Hey, if I tell you I'm freaked out,

624
00:39:02,381 --> 00:39:04,261
am I gonna lose
my Special Forces standing?

625
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:05,382
Oh, come on.

626
00:39:06,218 --> 00:39:08,048
Look,
Calvin keeps to his side of the river,

627
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:10,257
- we keep to ours.
- Mmm.

628
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:12,018
Don't worry. Just try to get some sleep.

629
00:39:12,099 --> 00:39:15,099
Yeah. I still think we should
tell the sheriff what's going on.

630
00:39:15,644 --> 00:39:16,984
Doc asked me not to.

631
00:39:17,063 --> 00:39:18,773
He wants to keep the peace.

632
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:20,106
I'm inclined to agree with him.

633
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:22,294
Right now, all the violence
is contained to the camps.

634
00:39:22,318 --> 00:39:23,688
I'd like to keep it that way.

635
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:26,613
Hey, look.

636
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:29,329
Tell you what. I will sleep
in my truck outside. How about that?

637
00:39:29,408 --> 00:39:30,328
You can't do that.

638
00:39:30,409 --> 00:39:32,079
I can. I do it all the time.

639
00:39:32,161 --> 00:39:33,001
Uh...

640
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:34,839
That way, if you need me,
I'll be right here.

641
00:39:36,248 --> 00:39:38,288
No. I can't let you do that.

642
00:39:39,293 --> 00:39:41,093
Look, there's a chair in my room.

643
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:43,840
Can you just stay there until I pass out?

644
00:39:45,132 --> 00:39:46,132
Okay?

645
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:48,635
Okay.

646
00:41:03,377 --> 00:41:04,377
Morgan!

647
00:41:05,254 --> 00:41:06,254
Lonergan!

648
00:41:09,842 --> 00:41:10,842
Don't!

649
00:41:13,929 --> 00:41:15,719
Come on! Let's go! Let's get out of here.

650
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:20,096
- Can't leave.
- Why not?

651
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:25,938
Gotta go, Jack!

652
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:27,357
Jack.

653
00:41:27,776 --> 00:41:28,896
- Preach!
- Jack!

654
00:41:29,778 --> 00:41:31,358
We gotta move outta here!

655
00:41:32,031 --> 00:41:33,661
Hey!

656
00:41:34,408 --> 00:41:35,988
Jack. Hey.

657
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:40,163
Jack.

658
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:44,504
