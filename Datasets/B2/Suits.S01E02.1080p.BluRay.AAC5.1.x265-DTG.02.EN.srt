1
00:00:06,297 --> 00:00:07,131
Uh...

2
00:00:13,221 --> 00:00:14,805
What is that,
three in a row?

3
00:00:14,931 --> 00:00:16,348
That would be four,
actually.

4
00:00:16,474 --> 00:00:17,558
Oh, God.

5
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:19,476
Come on. What do you say?
We go five out of nine?

6
00:00:19,602 --> 00:00:22,021
So you can keep abusing me?
No, thank you. I'm done.

7
00:00:22,147 --> 00:00:24,273
Oh, come on.
I'll spot you three.

8
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:25,941
Game time's over, Wyatt.
They're here.

9
00:00:26,067 --> 00:00:26,984
They're here?

10
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:28,110
Get set up in the conference room.

11
00:00:28,236 --> 00:00:29,653
Yeah.
No, I'll just, uh...

12
00:00:29,779 --> 00:00:31,196
Get set up
in the conference room.

13
00:00:34,075 --> 00:00:35,242
You did let him win,
right?

14
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:37,828
It wasn't easy. The guy has
the coordination of a two-year-old.

15
00:00:37,954 --> 00:00:40,205
I know. The last time
these venture capitalists came in,

16
00:00:40,331 --> 00:00:41,749
I took him boxing
to calm him down.

17
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:44,251
I basically had to punch myself
in the face to let him win.

18
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:47,546
I don't get it.
I mean, if he's such a genius,

19
00:00:47,672 --> 00:00:49,673
why does he get so nervous
around a bunch of investors?

20
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:51,133
Well,
you spend two years

21
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:53,218
working on a satellite phone
that fits in your pocket

22
00:00:53,344 --> 00:00:54,595
and then bet
the company on it.

23
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:56,805
You'd be a little nervous, too,
I bet.

24
00:00:56,931 --> 00:01:00,142
The prototype. I can't find it.
I don't know where I...

25
00:01:00,268 --> 00:01:01,101
You mean this?

26
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:03,687
I don't know what I'd do without you.

27
00:01:03,813 --> 00:01:05,647
- Fail miserably.
- I would.

28
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:08,442
- Is that the, uh...
- $20 million prototype, yes.

29
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:10,319
And you don't even get to look
at this bad boy

30
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:11,862
until after we close
the deal today.

31
00:01:11,988 --> 00:01:14,698
Wow.
They're like storm troopers.

32
00:01:14,824 --> 00:01:17,201
Storm troopers
don't write checks.

33
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:18,494
All you've got to do
is walk in there,

34
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:19,912
show them
how the phone works.

35
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:22,122
Right.
And Suntech Digital

36
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:24,291
will be a new force
in global communications.

37
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:25,751
Let's knock them dead.

38
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:29,004
All right.

39
00:01:30,465 --> 00:01:31,965
Whoa, whoa.
Where do you think you're going?

40
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:34,009
Into the room.
With the people.

41
00:01:34,135 --> 00:01:36,178
Wrong.
That's the adult table in there,

42
00:01:36,304 --> 00:01:38,180
and you haven't earned
the privilege yet.

43
00:01:38,306 --> 00:01:39,640
But I...
I played air hockey with him.

44
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:42,142
You need to go back to the office
and file the patent for the phone.

45
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:44,103
A patent?
I don't know how to file a patent.

46
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:45,813
- Figure it out.
- Can't we do that after...

47
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:47,815
No. And you keep talking,
I'm going to start billing you.

48
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:49,942
And my time
runs $1,000 an hour.

49
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:51,944
"But isn't this our time,
Mr. Hand?"

50
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:57,282
I stand corrected. Your
Fast Times at Ridgemont High quote,

51
00:01:57,408 --> 00:01:59,743
that proves you belong
at the adult table.

52
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:04,081
Right. That's a great movie,
and it spoke to a generation.

53
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:16,385
Hey. You busy?

54
00:02:20,765 --> 00:02:22,850
Okay. Have you ever
filed a patent before?

55
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:24,476
I just got back
from this meeting with Harvey,

56
00:02:24,602 --> 00:02:25,686
and he wants me
to file this patent,

57
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:28,689
but I have no idea
what that paperwork looks like. So...

58
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:30,941
You know, any help in this arena
would be really...

59
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:35,279
Did Harvey call you
and tell you to do that?

60
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:48,375
If it isn't the golden boy.
You're, uh, Harvey's project, right?

61
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:49,751
What's your name?

62
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:51,253
Mike. Mike Ross.

63
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:54,214
Gregory Boone.
So what are you doing here?

64
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:57,050
Weren't you signing some big deal
this afternoon downtown?

65
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:59,178
Well, evidently,
I haven't earned the privilege yet.

66
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:01,013
You get
the adult table speech?

67
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:07,853
Instead of watching the deal close,
I get to file the patent.

68
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:09,438
Yeah, those suck.

69
00:03:11,649 --> 00:03:14,401
Wait. You...
You've done one of these before?

70
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:16,486
Like, a hundred.
Why?

71
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:23,035
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.

72
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:27,789
Oh. It's okay.
You don't have to apologize.

73
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:29,583
I took care of it.

74
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:32,920
The patent claim?
I negotiated a deal to get it done.

75
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:34,338
What are you
talking about?

76
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:36,381
Gregory.
He agreed to file it for me.

77
00:03:36,507 --> 00:03:38,425
And all I have to do
is proof his Bainbridge briefs.

78
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:41,511
Ah. That explains
why he said to give you this.

79
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:45,599
And why he called you
a sucker.

80
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,518
He called me a what, now?

81
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:54,149
Mike Ross, allow me
to introduce the Bainbridge briefs.

82
00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:57,194
- Which stack?
- All of them.

83
00:03:58,613 --> 00:03:59,738
Wait a minute.
Are these all...

84
00:03:59,864 --> 00:04:01,865
Still printing?
Yeah. I give it about a half hour.

85
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:06,119
Oh. It's six printers,
23 pages a minute, 30 minutes.

86
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:08,455
That's 4,140 pages.

87
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:09,581
Plus all this.

88
00:04:09,707 --> 00:04:11,416
Which means the next time
you negotiate a deal,

89
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:13,377
I would suggest
you get your facts straight.

90
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:16,255
Ugh! I am a sucker.

91
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:17,297
Mmm-hmm.

92
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:20,968
When did that happen?

93
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:24,721
See the money, wanna stay
for your meal

94
00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:28,100
Get another piece of pie
for your wife

95
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:31,520
Everybody wanna know
how it feel

96
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:34,856
Everybody wanna see
what it's like

97
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:38,193
I'll even eat a bean pie
I don't mind

98
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:39,861
Me and missy is so early

99
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:42,030
Busy, busy making money

100
00:04:42,156 --> 00:04:43,282
All right!

101
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:47,828
All step back
I'm 'bout to dance

102
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:50,914
The greenback boogie

103
00:04:55,336 --> 00:04:56,795
Nice of you
to join us this morning.

104
00:04:56,921 --> 00:04:58,672
For your information,
Mr. Sunshine,

105
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:02,009
I've been here all night proofing.
That belongs to... Okay.

106
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:03,885
Where's my confirmation?

107
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:04,970
Your what?

108
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:07,055
The fact that you don't know
already concerns me.

109
00:05:07,181 --> 00:05:08,807
Oh, you mean
the patent thing?

110
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:11,018
The patent thing
is the only piece of paper

111
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:14,730
that's holding up our deal
from yesterday. Where is it?

112
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:16,356
On my desk.

113
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:18,567
Well, if it's not on mine
by the time I get back,

114
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:20,277
I'm going to
feed you to Louis.

115
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,654
No problem.

116
00:05:29,787 --> 00:05:30,871
Please tell me
that you filed that.

117
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:32,789
Patent? No, not yet.

118
00:05:32,915 --> 00:05:34,207
I gave it to you yesterday.

119
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:35,959
The same time I gave you
my Bainbridge briefs,

120
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:36,960
which you
haven't finished.

121
00:05:37,086 --> 00:05:39,004
I was here all night
and I barely got through half.

122
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:40,547
And I was on hold
for almost 11 minutes

123
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:42,674
before I gave up on your patent.
So what's your point?

124
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,384
Look. I swear
I will finish those filings.

125
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:47,429
But you have to give me this patent
confirmation before Harvey gets back.

126
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:50,057
Sorry, Golden Boy.
A deal's a deal.

127
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:08,200
What do you think
you're doing?

128
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:14,289
Uh, I'm proofing briefs.
Why? Is there a problem?

129
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:16,333
Yeah, there is.
That's Gregory's responsibility.

130
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:17,334
Why are you handling it?

131
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:20,295
Oh, I volunteered.

132
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:22,881
He didn't
pawn it off on you?

133
00:06:23,007 --> 00:06:26,551
No. No. I mean, he didn't even
want me to do it,

134
00:06:26,677 --> 00:06:31,181
but I... You know,
I had some extra time, so I insisted.

135
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:39,272
Congratulations.

136
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:42,317
You've shown loyalty
to your fellow associates.

137
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:44,569
I know Gregory tricked you
into doing his work.

138
00:06:44,695 --> 00:06:46,947
I wanted to see how you'd react
when pressed about it.

139
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:50,075
You held up.
I respect that.

140
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,077
Thanks?

141
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:53,537
You see, but I don't understand
something, though.

142
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:54,871
If you didn't know
how to file a patent,

143
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:56,706
then why didn't you
just run to Harvey?

144
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:59,835
He was busy.

145
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:02,963
But you see, Mike,
that's why you come to see me.

146
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:10,637
Look, Mike,
I know I can come across a bit

147
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:12,681
prickly.

148
00:07:14,642 --> 00:07:15,809
But we're
a team here.

149
00:07:16,352 --> 00:07:18,520
That means
I'm here to help.

150
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,150
Okay. All right.

151
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:25,152
So, can you help me now?

152
00:07:26,904 --> 00:07:28,363
I already have.

153
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:33,410
All right.
Thank you, Louis.

154
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:43,420
Donna. Blue is your color.
Is Harvey back?

155
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:45,172
No.

156
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:46,840
Can I put this
on his desk?

157
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:47,924
Yes.

158
00:07:48,217 --> 00:07:50,510
Will you tell him
I put it there hours ago?

159
00:07:51,762 --> 00:07:53,388
What time
you want me to say?

160
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:55,223
11:00 a.m?

161
00:07:55,349 --> 00:07:56,558
Absolutely.

162
00:07:57,852 --> 00:07:59,936
And then maybe I can use my access
to his bank accounts

163
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:01,980
to buy myself
a house in the Hamptons.

164
00:08:03,357 --> 00:08:04,441
- 12:15?
- No.

165
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,369
You wanted to see me?

166
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:20,874
Sit down.

167
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:29,841
I looked through your work
on the Bainbridge briefs.

168
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:36,765
Spectacular.

169
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:40,519
You caught
the discrepancies between

170
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:42,062
"listed assets"
and "potential assets."

171
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:43,563
That had a huge impact,
Mike.

172
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:47,734
Yeah. I know. Millions. But anyone
would have caught that, right?

173
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:50,153
Um, out of the 50 associates
that are under my purview,

174
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:52,113
not one of them
would have caught that.

175
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,615
You just have
this eye for detail, Mike.

176
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:55,325
I mean, no wonder why Harvey
is so crazy about you.

177
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:58,286
It's amazing. I mean, I really,
really, seriously appreciate that.

178
00:08:58,412 --> 00:09:00,622
Hey, thank you, Louis.
That...

179
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:03,291
That's nice.

180
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:04,376
You know that I pick

181
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,170
a pony out of the herd every year,
don't you?

182
00:09:07,838 --> 00:09:09,548
- A pony?
- Oh, yeah.

183
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:10,966
Someone
who shows potential.

184
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:12,842
Stamp my own little brand
on him.

185
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:14,553
Mmm.

186
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:15,804
Are you that pony,
Mike?

187
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:23,061
I work for Harvey.

188
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:25,355
As you should.

189
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:26,314
Good.

190
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,816
Well, listen,
I have some work to get to.

191
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:30,360
So, maybe we can,
uh, meet for lunch

192
00:09:30,486 --> 00:09:32,112
tomorrow at the club,
say 1:00 p.m?

193
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:33,363
Uh, you know,
tomorrow...

194
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:34,614
I know I just posed that
as a question,

195
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,700
but I really
didn't mean it that way.

196
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,458
Hey. What's up?

197
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:49,879
I just heard from Wyatt. He got
a response from the patent office.

198
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:51,423
And?

199
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:52,966
It's been denied.

200
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:54,467
What?

201
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:56,553
Evidently,
there was a similar claim.

202
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:58,305
Wait. What do you mean?
Somebody beat us to it?

203
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:00,640
No,
someone beat you to it.

204
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:02,601
They filed
less than 24 hours ago,

205
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:05,562
which means you filed a day later
than you said you would.

206
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:07,397
I tried to tell you
that I didn't know how to do that.

207
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:08,607
And I told you
to figure it out.

208
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:10,025
And I did
and it got filed.

209
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:13,111
After you lied
and said you'd already followed through.

210
00:10:16,657 --> 00:10:19,284
Okay.
What's going to happen now?

211
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:21,786
I suggest you get on the phone,
call the patent office,

212
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:23,204
and find out
who beat us to it.

213
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:25,874
Then you're going to have Donna
find any judge who will listen

214
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,208
so we can get an injunction

215
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:29,628
and stop whoever it is
from launching their product first.

216
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:30,629
Okay. Got it.

217
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:32,464
Now I've got to call Wyatt
and calm him down.

218
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:34,090
You think that's going to be
a walk in the park?

219
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:38,136
Hey. Harvey.

220
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:41,723
Did you tell him
it was me?

221
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:46,019
Why would I do that?
I'm responsible for you. It was me.

222
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:10,960
They signed the paperwork, Wyatt.
They can't pull out.

223
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:13,505
The patent dispute is not an issue.
Okay?

224
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:16,299
No, they cut the check.
End of story.

225
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:18,968
I'm at court right now.
Let me call you back.

226
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:21,930
So, it's Velocity Data Solutions.

227
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:23,515
Did you serve them
with notice of the hearing?

228
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:25,266
They're a billion dollar company.

229
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:28,436
The bigger they are,
the harder they fall.

230
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:32,357
Did you not see
the sign outside?

231
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:33,483
Just putting it away,
Your Honor.

232
00:11:33,609 --> 00:11:35,318
It should already be
in your pocket.

233
00:11:35,444 --> 00:11:39,114
But you were running late,
so perhaps that's why it wasn't.

234
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,491
Let the record show
that Counsel is fined $1,000

235
00:11:41,617 --> 00:11:43,451
for failing to follow
the posted rules of the court.

236
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:45,870
- Your Honor, I didn't mean to...
- And for mouthing off.

237
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:46,830
Mouthing off?

238
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:50,625
Another outburst like that,
and you will be escorted out.

239
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:53,628
Wow.

240
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:56,756
Mr. Salinger.

241
00:11:57,633 --> 00:11:59,175
Your Honor,
this is a waste of your time.

242
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:01,636
The U.S. Patent Office
is the only judicial body

243
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:04,097
that should be handling
this dispute.

244
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:07,225
Velocity Data Solutions
requests dismissal.

245
00:12:08,644 --> 00:12:10,770
Your Honor.
If I may.

246
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:14,691
- This injunction request is...
- Counsels, approach.

247
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:24,534
That's the exhibit filing?

248
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,912
Why wasn't I given
a courtesy copy?

249
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:30,081
Given the expedited nature
of this hearing, I assumed...

250
00:12:30,207 --> 00:12:31,708
Hand it to me.
Hand it to me?

251
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:42,385
And I would have assumed
that a lawyer appearing before a judge

252
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:44,888
would come on time,
with his mouth shut,

253
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:47,015
and prepared
with a courtesy brief.

254
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,852
My apologies.

255
00:12:50,978 --> 00:12:52,187
Request denied.

256
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:53,855
Court adjourned
for the morning.

257
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:57,275
Better luck next time,
Harvey.

258
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:03,573
From now on, I want him
when I go against you.

259
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:09,204
Wait here.

260
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:15,376
- Your Honor? I have...
- Send him in.

261
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:27,388
Counselor?

262
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:30,934
You asked to see me.
You must have something to say.

263
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:34,437
Excluding friends, associates,
and the clients that I represent,

264
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:37,273
there are very few people
that I'm on a first-name basis with.

265
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:42,153
And I've never had anyone,
let alone a judge I've never met,

266
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:44,697
address me as Harvey
in open court.

267
00:13:45,282 --> 00:13:46,115
But if you're going
to screw me,

268
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:48,910
I guess it's only fair
that you call me by name.

269
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:52,121
I could have you brought up on review
for talking to me like that.

270
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:54,082
Then we can get it
all on record.

271
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:55,291
Get what?

272
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:59,045
Whatever it is that you seem to have
against me for no apparent reason.

273
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:02,799
I have a solid argument for any
reasonable judge to grant my injunction.

274
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:04,551
So solid,
it begs the question,

275
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:05,760
why do you
have it in for me?

276
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:08,429
And I don't even know
your first name.

277
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:11,432
Really?
My wife never mentioned it?

278
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:12,767
Your wife?

279
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:15,186
The woman you had an affair with
last month?

280
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,151
Hey, wait.
What happened in there?

281
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:25,446
Donna. The address for that fundraiser
at the gallery last month?

282
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:28,449
I need you to text it to me
and clear my afternoon.

283
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:30,994
Hey.
Where are we going?

284
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,537
You're going
back to the office

285
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:34,956
to file an interference claim
with the Patent Office.

286
00:14:35,082 --> 00:14:37,041
Okay. Wait.
What's that?

287
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:39,502
It's how they determine
who wins these situations.

288
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:41,462
It's not always who filed first,
so we have a chance.

289
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:42,964
So why didn't we do that
in the first place?

290
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:45,884
Because it takes longer and I wanted
to head Velocity off at the pass.

291
00:14:46,802 --> 00:14:48,011
Hey,
where are you going?

292
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:49,637
To iron out a wrinkle.

293
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:58,646
If you're really interested,
come back tomorrow around 1:00.

294
00:14:58,772 --> 00:15:01,399
The afternoon light
really makes this canvas come alive.

295
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:03,109
Pardon me.
I was wondering,

296
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:06,613
would I get a discount for being the guy
you cheated on your husband with?

297
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,658
Can you excuse me
for a second?

298
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:14,370
What are you doing here?

299
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:16,289
I had a hearing
in front of the judge this morning.

300
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:19,167
It didn't go very well.
Why did you lie to him?

301
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:20,209
I'm sorry.

302
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:22,295
I mean,
I recall you being tipsy that night,

303
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:25,006
but I'm finding it hard to believe
that your memory is so cloudy,

304
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:26,674
you forgot
I sent you home in a cab.

305
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,259
After humiliating me.

306
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:29,385
Well,
I was a perfect gentleman.

307
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:30,929
Yes, exactly.

308
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:33,222
I fall all over myself
making a pass,

309
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:35,558
and you do the right thing
and send me home.

310
00:15:35,684 --> 00:15:37,435
Okay.
I'm sorry you felt humiliated.

311
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:39,604
But I told you
I don't sleep with married women.

312
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:41,439
Right.
The moral code.

313
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:44,233
No. It's too big
of a pain in the ass.

314
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,444
As evidenced by my experience
in court this morning.

315
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:47,946
What do you want from me,
Harvey?

316
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:49,697
I need you
to tell him the truth.

317
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:51,240
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.

318
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:52,492
Why didn't you
just tell him?

319
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:53,618
He's never
going to believe me.

320
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:55,536
And what makes you think
he'll believe me?

321
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:00,333
Because he'd want to.

322
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:05,964
Our whole marriage, Donald's only ever
cared about one thing.

323
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:08,216
His sterling reputation.

324
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:09,759
Never overturned.

325
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:14,681
I was...
When he found out you and I had...

326
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:17,100
He changed.

327
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:22,063
Looked at me for the first time again.
Like I mattered.

328
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:25,650
I'm sorry.
I can't tell him.

329
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:34,409
No, this is a request
from the applicant for...

330
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:37,245
Yes, but I have up to a year
before you...

331
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:38,830
Hello?
No, I can't hold.

332
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:39,914
You ready?

333
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,333
I can't go to the club.
I have to do this for Harvey.

334
00:16:42,459 --> 00:16:44,502
Yes, the person before you
said that I had to file the blue form.

335
00:16:44,628 --> 00:16:45,461
No, no, no, no, no, no.

336
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:47,130
We have a court reserved in 30 minutes.
We have to go now.

337
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:48,673
Yes, I'm trying to file
the oral hearing.

338
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:51,718
But what you people keep doing
is transferring. Hello?

339
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:52,802
Hello?

340
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:57,932
You work for me, too.

341
00:16:58,058 --> 00:17:00,393
And that means
when Harvey is not here,

342
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:02,020
you've got to listen
to what I say, Mike.

343
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:05,606
Louis, this claim needs
to be filed today. Harvey's orders.

344
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:08,651
- In that case...
- Gregory?

345
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:11,279
I'm on your side, remember?
Watch this.

346
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:12,488
- Yes.
- Hi.

347
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:15,116
Patent interference claim? Can you
have it filed before we get back?

348
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:16,826
Cool? Thanks.
Let's go.

349
00:17:18,662 --> 00:17:20,204
Just with a...

350
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:40,683
Who's winning?

351
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:42,935
You need to warm up?

352
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:44,687
No, I'm good.

353
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:47,607
You serve first. Come on.
Show me what you've got.

354
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:49,108
Fifteen-love.

355
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:50,193
All right.
You want to play like that?

356
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:52,570
Let's do this thing.
Come on.

357
00:17:57,701 --> 00:17:58,785
Oh!

358
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,078
Wait. Wait.

359
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:05,583
Hey, Tom.

360
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:08,878
Game. Hey, Tom.

361
00:18:10,672 --> 00:18:13,091
I mean, I've seen your pro shot, man.
You have really improved.

362
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:14,550
I'm not kidding.
You know, maybe you can play now.

363
00:18:14,676 --> 00:18:16,260
Me and my associate
were just starting up.

364
00:18:16,386 --> 00:18:18,763
How about you two against me?
I'll just play...

365
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:21,307
Tom, seriously. I'll even...
I'll spot you three sets.

366
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:23,684
All right.
I'll see you later, then.

367
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:26,104
Isn't that, uh...

368
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:27,396
That's Tom Keller.

369
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:31,400
Yeah. The Premiere Fantasy Sports guy,
right? That's him.

370
00:18:31,735 --> 00:18:32,652
Yeah,
I play that every year.

371
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:35,154
Yeah, you and five million
other fantasy footballers.

372
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,824
I mean, the guy generates
200 million per annum, right?

373
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:41,244
And he still uses his
fraternity brother as a general counsel.

374
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,955
I mean, someone with that many assets
just makes me sick.

375
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:46,290
Okay, so,
is it my serve?

376
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:48,459
Let's hit the showers.

377
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:50,753
But we...

378
00:18:52,005 --> 00:18:53,798
- Sorry, sir, but...
- No introductions necessary.

379
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:55,591
We're on a first-name basis.

380
00:18:55,717 --> 00:18:58,010
I brought you a present.
Yours to keep.

381
00:18:58,137 --> 00:18:59,679
After you sign
my injunction.

382
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:01,597
- A pen?
- It's custom.

383
00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:03,558
French. Le Bic.

384
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:05,643
My earlier ruling
wasn't clear enough for you?

385
00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:08,312
Crystal. But I didn't want you
to suffer for it.

386
00:19:08,438 --> 00:19:10,523
You see,
if you don't sign my injunction,

387
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:11,941
there's going to be
a lawsuit.

388
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:14,610
And when the next judge
sees all the facts,

389
00:19:14,736 --> 00:19:16,028
he's going to overturn
your ruling.

390
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:17,113
You may be right.

391
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:18,781
But by then,
your clients will have dumped you.

392
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:19,866
You may be right,

393
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:23,119
but that sterling reputation
that you value so highly?

394
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:24,162
Down the tubes.

395
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:26,664
Which would matter,
except for one thing.

396
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:29,292
I've decided
to leave the bench.

397
00:19:29,793 --> 00:19:32,003
Try my hand
at litigation.

398
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:34,422
And I'm your last case.

399
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:37,592
Divorce will do that.
Make you want to change your life.

400
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:38,718
You filed for divorce?

401
00:19:39,469 --> 00:19:40,469
Soon enough.

402
00:19:41,638 --> 00:19:46,058
Perhaps we could discuss
a little quid pro quo before I do.

403
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:48,394
I'm listening.

404
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,564
You sign a document
that says you slept with my wife.

405
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:53,065
I'll give you
your injunction.

406
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:54,567
And why would you want me
to do that?

407
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:57,445
To prevent her from taking me
for half of everything I own.

408
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:00,990
So, what you're saying is,
you'd like to blackmail me.

409
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:03,367
I'm saying
we could both benefit.

410
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:08,039
And since you're the one who screwed me,
I'd say you owe me one.

411
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:18,925
Harvey Specter.

412
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:20,468
What are you hiding from me,
Harvey?

413
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:23,346
Wyatt. Do you remember six months ago
when you got all nervous

414
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:24,889
and thought everything
was falling apart?

415
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:26,515
Yeah.
Yeah, but this is a little different.

416
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:29,727
That's what you said then.
And a year ago, and 18 months ago.

417
00:20:29,853 --> 00:20:31,938
And we agreed
that when this happens again,

418
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:34,023
I'll remind you
of those times

419
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:35,858
- and I'll hang up.
- Okay. Harvey...

420
00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:36,943
Trust me,
it's for your own good.

421
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:38,402
Harvey,
please don't hang up...

422
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:48,913
Hey, Tom. You just missed a great game.
We were, uh...

423
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,457
We were just...
I was beating him.

424
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:59,006
You know, 10 years ago,
before these dot-com millionaires,

425
00:20:59,132 --> 00:21:00,591
there were men of substance
in this club.

426
00:21:00,717 --> 00:21:03,469
You know, men who understood
how business gets done.

427
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:06,013
Well, maybe he's just not interested
in talking business

428
00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:07,056
while he's in a towel.

429
00:21:07,182 --> 00:21:10,017
Mike, he's not interested
because he doesn't think I'm cool.

430
00:21:10,143 --> 00:21:11,352
And he's a pot-head
who thinks that

431
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:14,313
anybody who doesn't smoke is a nerd.
I mean...

432
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:17,316
So I treat my body
like a temple.

433
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:20,403
Does that make me uncool?
I don't think so.

434
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:21,737
No.

435
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:26,993
But on the other hand,
you kind of seem his type.

436
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:30,454
- Why do you say that?
- Because you're young.

437
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:33,457
And you think of yourself
as hip.

438
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:34,417
Whatever, I guess.

439
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:37,878
You know, I'm sure you enjoy
the occasional bong hit.

440
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:42,174
No. No.
I don't smoke.

441
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:46,887
I mean,
that's just a little strange.

442
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:47,847
Why is it strange?

443
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:50,391
I mean, because, you know,
the drug test that you took...

444
00:21:50,517 --> 00:21:54,020
Well, that I made you take,
would indicate otherwise.

445
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:05,072
You're not going to dispute it now,
are you?

446
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:07,658
Relax, Mike.

447
00:22:08,243 --> 00:22:10,578
Relax.
I'm not offended.

448
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:11,996
I'm not even surprised.

449
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:13,748
Matter of fact,
in this instance,

450
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:15,291
we could use this
to our advantage.

451
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:16,334
What are you talking about,
Louis?

452
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,294
I'm just saying.
You know, back in the day,

453
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,504
to woo a client,
you would take them to dinner.

454
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:23,174
You would buy them a drink.
But that's not going to work with Tom.

455
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,301
Not in a million years.
Not with me, anyway.

456
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:27,053
But if someone
of his generation

457
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:29,263
who shares
the same proclivities...

458
00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:30,681
Are you saying you want me
to smoke pot with him?

459
00:22:30,807 --> 00:22:33,392
I'm saying you can help me
land him as a client.

460
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:37,313
That's the only reason I'm here,
isn't it?

461
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:40,358
No, Mike. Stop.
Just stop, okay?

462
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:42,943
I assure you, no one
was more disappointed than me

463
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:45,780
when I found out the results
of your drug test. Okay?

464
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:48,157
But then, I had to say to myself,
"Louis, do what you do.

465
00:22:48,283 --> 00:22:50,117
"Make lemonade."

466
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:52,286
And if I don't?

467
00:22:54,748 --> 00:22:56,415
You're a smart kid.

468
00:22:57,584 --> 00:22:59,710
And I really
want to see you succeed.

469
00:23:08,595 --> 00:23:09,512
Ball's in
your court.

470
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:15,142
Hey, Tom.
I was just going to tell you I wanted...

471
00:23:21,691 --> 00:23:23,150
Dude creeps me out,
man.

472
00:23:23,276 --> 00:23:24,985
And he never wears a towel.
Ever.

473
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:27,029
Yeah,
tell me about it.

474
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:33,411
Hey, uh, I know you must hear this
all the time, but...

475
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:35,329
Totally addicted
to your website, man.

476
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:38,791
All right. Who placed sixth
in passing yards last year?

477
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:41,001
Carson Palmer.

478
00:23:41,128 --> 00:23:44,296
3970.
How many sacks did James Hall have?

479
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:46,048
Eleven?

480
00:23:46,174 --> 00:23:48,050
Uh-uh.
Ten-and-a-half.

481
00:23:48,176 --> 00:23:49,385
Yeah, I know.
I rounded up.

482
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:52,096
Well, your league doesn't,
or I'd have come in better than 20th.

483
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:57,059
You're Ross' Raiders.
Right?

484
00:23:57,727 --> 00:23:58,727
Yeah. Mike Ross.

485
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:00,146
Tom Keller.

486
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:01,313
Yeah.
Good to meet you.

487
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,190
Congratulations, man.
You've got a nice little team there.

488
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:05,401
No, if Roethlisberger
hadn't let you down,

489
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:06,902
you would have been top 10 for sure.
I'm telling you.

490
00:24:07,028 --> 00:24:08,070
Yeah, well,
that's what happens

491
00:24:08,196 --> 00:24:10,698
when you get high
before the draft, right?

492
00:24:11,032 --> 00:24:12,366
You get high?

493
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:52,823
How's it going
with Harvey?

494
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:55,784
Me?

495
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:57,870
Uh, it's...

496
00:24:58,205 --> 00:25:00,122
You know, it's good.
I'm learning.

497
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:03,792
A lot of learning.

498
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:05,294
Bye.

499
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:42,122
What's black and white
and going to cost you dearly?

500
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,333
Whoa.

501
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:47,253
Took me all morning to file this,
Golden Boy.

502
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:49,171
You owe me.
And I won't forget it.

503
00:25:49,297 --> 00:25:51,215
Oh, God. Thank you.

504
00:25:52,133 --> 00:25:54,343
You smell papery.

505
00:25:57,722 --> 00:26:01,183
Wyatt, it doesn't happen
immediately. The paperwork is coming.

506
00:26:01,935 --> 00:26:03,060
Don't worry about it,
okay?

507
00:26:03,186 --> 00:26:05,312
Boom. There you go.
Look at that.

508
00:26:06,189 --> 00:26:08,190
Wyatt, let me call you back.
Okay?

509
00:26:08,316 --> 00:26:10,025
Five minutes. Bye.

510
00:26:11,194 --> 00:26:12,152
What's this?

511
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:15,239
What is this? That's confirmation
of the interference claim,

512
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:17,408
which I proofed.
Up top.

513
00:26:17,701 --> 00:26:19,159
What, you think
you're working in a fraternity?

514
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:21,036
You don't barge in here
when I'm on the phone.

515
00:26:22,122 --> 00:26:24,248
And why are you so flush?

516
00:26:24,374 --> 00:26:25,708
Why am I so what?

517
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:27,793
Your face is red.
Looks like you've been in the sun.

518
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:30,337
Um, yeah, I, uh...

519
00:26:31,172 --> 00:26:34,258
This morning, Louis,
uh, took me to the tennis club.

520
00:26:34,634 --> 00:26:37,636
He didn't give you the speech
about the ponies, did he?

521
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:38,679
Oh, my God.

522
00:26:38,805 --> 00:26:40,639
How he likes to cut one
from the herd?

523
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:42,182
The ponies.

524
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:43,350
Was he wearing
the headband?

525
00:26:43,476 --> 00:26:45,644
You know about the headband?
With the...

526
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:47,271
Oh, my God.
Are you kidding me with that guy?

527
00:26:47,397 --> 00:26:50,065
Hey. If you guys were playing tennis
all morning,

528
00:26:50,191 --> 00:26:52,484
how did you have time
to file this?

529
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:56,071
Uh...

530
00:26:56,781 --> 00:26:58,449
He... It was...
This morning, actually,

531
00:26:58,575 --> 00:27:00,075
I was on the phone
with them,

532
00:27:00,201 --> 00:27:02,036
uh,
and Louis helped me.

533
00:27:02,162 --> 00:27:02,953
Look at me.

534
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:05,039
And he did this snapping thing,
and Gregory...

535
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:06,248
Look at me.

536
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:14,798
You're high.

537
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:18,844
Get out.

538
00:27:20,847 --> 00:27:22,473
Harvey,
you don't understand. Louis...

539
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:23,557
Out.

540
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:38,155
Donna?

541
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:41,116
Get Wyatt
back on the line?

542
00:27:58,176 --> 00:27:59,843
What are you doing in here?

543
00:27:59,969 --> 00:28:01,720
It's the ladies' room.

544
00:28:04,641 --> 00:28:06,100
I'm sorry.

545
00:28:06,267 --> 00:28:08,644
Can you do me a favor?
Can we, um...

546
00:28:09,229 --> 00:28:11,397
Can we just keep this
our little secret?

547
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:13,357
Why are your eyes so red?

548
00:28:16,569 --> 00:28:18,404
I need some air.

549
00:28:20,824 --> 00:28:22,950
- You took Mike on a field trip today?
- Yeah.

550
00:28:23,076 --> 00:28:26,245
Aside from subjecting him
to you in a towel, what happened?

551
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:28,205
I beat him in straight sets,
if that's what you're getting at.

552
00:28:28,331 --> 00:28:30,290
Don't play dumb, Louis.
Tell me what you did to him.

553
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:31,792
What are you, jealous?
Harvey, come on.

554
00:28:31,918 --> 00:28:33,669
The kid is starving
for a mentor.

555
00:28:33,795 --> 00:28:34,753
Someone to give him
some advice.

556
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:35,671
So, maybe if you just
took the time...

557
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:37,840
I'm telling you right now.
You try to move in on him...

558
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:39,258
Harvey,
where is this coming from?

559
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:42,928
Harvey, I've got the outside
council for Velocity on the line.

560
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:44,596
Put him through.

561
00:28:51,312 --> 00:28:52,980
What happened
after you smoked with that guy?

562
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:57,317
I just got paranoid.
I felt bad for lying to him. And I...

563
00:28:58,111 --> 00:28:59,903
I told him
that Louis put me up to it

564
00:29:00,029 --> 00:29:00,946
and that he couldn't trust him.

565
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:02,823
So what did he say?

566
00:29:02,949 --> 00:29:05,075
He said that Louis
gave him the creeps, anyway.

567
00:29:05,201 --> 00:29:06,493
And he was never
going to hire him.

568
00:29:06,619 --> 00:29:08,078
Okay.
You have to tell Harvey.

569
00:29:09,497 --> 00:29:10,956
I tried.
He wasn't listening.

570
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:12,958
So then go home
and tell him tomorrow.

571
00:29:13,084 --> 00:29:16,295
God, you should have seen his face.
We had a deal.

572
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:17,963
What deal?

573
00:29:21,801 --> 00:29:22,718
Thanks for hearing me out.

574
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:24,553
No, what are you talking about?
What deal?

575
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:27,514
It's nothing.
I just promised that I wouldn't

576
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:30,726
do anything stupid and let him down.
And I did.

577
00:29:30,852 --> 00:29:32,227
Wait.
You let him down?

578
00:29:32,353 --> 00:29:34,730
No. The way I see it,
he let you down.

579
00:29:34,856 --> 00:29:35,689
What?

580
00:29:35,815 --> 00:29:37,733
He's got to know
what Louis is capable of.

581
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:39,193
So if he didn't listen
to what happened,

582
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:40,819
it's 'cause
he didn't want to.

583
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:42,446
Mike,
you need to tell him.

584
00:29:42,572 --> 00:29:44,239
I don't know how often
you've come across Harvey,

585
00:29:44,365 --> 00:29:46,867
but he's not exactly
the listening type.

586
00:29:46,993 --> 00:29:50,120
Right. But he's also
the first person that would tell you

587
00:29:50,246 --> 00:29:53,332
never to take no for an answer.
From anyone.

588
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:03,967
Harvey,
how are you doing this fine day?

589
00:30:04,093 --> 00:30:06,929
I'm ready to hear
your settlement offer, George.

590
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:08,597
Cutting to the chase.
I like that.

591
00:30:08,723 --> 00:30:10,432
What's the number?

592
00:30:12,185 --> 00:30:13,352
Ten million.

593
00:30:14,604 --> 00:30:17,272
That's half what we spent
developing the prototype.

594
00:30:17,398 --> 00:30:19,858
And 10 million more than you'll get,
the way the wind is blowing.

595
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:21,318
Yeah, well,
winds can change.

596
00:30:21,444 --> 00:30:23,987
And you and I both know the injunction
will get overturned on appeal.

597
00:30:24,113 --> 00:30:25,447
I don't know
anything of the kind.

598
00:30:25,573 --> 00:30:27,616
Then why are you calling
with an offer at all?

599
00:30:32,413 --> 00:30:34,206
Fifteen.
That's as high as I'll go.

600
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:35,541
Okay, I'm hanging up now.

601
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:37,209
Twenty million.
That's it.

602
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:38,961
The offer's good
for 24 hours.

603
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:40,462
And I'm sure
I don't have to remind you

604
00:30:40,588 --> 00:30:43,757
that you're legally required
to present this to your client.

605
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:55,269
Is he free?

606
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:56,854
Not for you.

607
00:30:57,355 --> 00:30:58,564
How much
did he tell you?

608
00:30:59,315 --> 00:31:02,276
He didn't have to tell me.
I read it on his face.

609
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:04,278
- You hurt him.
- Maybe he did the same to me.

610
00:31:08,741 --> 00:31:10,409
Get in there.

611
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:12,786
And be careful.

612
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:19,459
Harvey.

613
00:31:19,586 --> 00:31:21,795
We talked about this, right?
Barging into my office?

614
00:31:21,921 --> 00:31:23,338
I'm not leaving
until you hear me out.

615
00:31:23,464 --> 00:31:25,215
- You want to bet?
- You owe it to me.

616
00:31:25,341 --> 00:31:27,301
- Oh, I owe it to you.
- Yeah.

617
00:31:27,427 --> 00:31:29,595
Look, this is not my fault, all right?
Louis made me do it.

618
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:31,555
Louis did. Right.
He put a gun to your head,

619
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:32,556
made you smoke pot.

620
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:34,808
Yeah, he did.
He pulled out the drug test,

621
00:31:34,934 --> 00:31:36,101
which I failed,
by the way.

622
00:31:36,227 --> 00:31:37,853
And then he told me
that if I didn't smoke pot

623
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:41,356
to help him land this new client,
that he'd fire me.

624
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:46,820
It's not so different than asking
someone out for drinks, is it?

625
00:31:46,946 --> 00:31:47,905
You and I had a deal.

626
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:49,406
I'm sorry.

627
00:31:49,532 --> 00:31:51,450
And if next time Louis asks you
to do something

628
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:54,077
that I told you not to do,
what then?

629
00:31:54,203 --> 00:31:55,996
I told you
that I did not have a choice.

630
00:31:56,122 --> 00:31:57,748
- Oh, because he had a gun to your head.
- Yes.

631
00:31:57,874 --> 00:32:00,042
And what are your choices
if someone puts a gun to your head?

632
00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:02,377
What are you talking about?
You do what they say, or they shoot you.

633
00:32:02,503 --> 00:32:03,962
Wrong.
You take the gun.

634
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:05,130
Or you pull out
a bigger one.

635
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:06,506
Or you call
their bluff.

636
00:32:06,633 --> 00:32:09,509
Or you do any one
of 146 other things.

637
00:32:09,636 --> 00:32:10,677
If you can't think
for yourself,

638
00:32:10,803 --> 00:32:11,803
maybe you aren't cut out
for this.

639
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:14,348
No. I can and I am.
Look, I did what I had to do.

640
00:32:14,474 --> 00:32:16,266
I made the best
out of a bad situation.

641
00:32:16,392 --> 00:32:17,434
Which is
what I am good at.

642
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,186
Which is what you hired me to do
in the first place.

643
00:32:19,312 --> 00:32:21,647
Yeah, I hired you,
and I expect your loyalty.

644
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:23,815
So if Louis asks you to do
something like that,

645
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:24,858
you come
to me first.

646
00:32:24,984 --> 00:32:26,818
Oh, right.
Like when I came to you

647
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:29,154
and, uh, you told me
that I couldn't sit at the adult table.

648
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,572
Right,
I remember that. Or...

649
00:32:30,698 --> 00:32:33,325
Or when you told me to go file
the patent by myself. Like that?

650
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:34,618
Excuse me?

651
00:32:34,744 --> 00:32:38,288
You know what? Maybe it's time
you showed me some loyalty.

652
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:44,628
Do you know how long it was
before I got to sit at the adult table?

653
00:32:44,754 --> 00:32:46,505
It was when I brought in
my first client.

654
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:48,674
Which I don't recall
you having done.

655
00:32:49,425 --> 00:32:52,803
And when you screwed up that patent
and Wyatt went apeshit on me,

656
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:55,347
I didn't put that on you.
I took it on myself.

657
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:56,974
Because that's my job.

658
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:59,726
And it's your job to do
what I say when I say it.

659
00:32:59,852 --> 00:33:02,270
So if you're talking
about loyalty,

660
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:04,773
you better goddamn
earn it.

661
00:33:07,443 --> 00:33:09,111
You're right.

662
00:33:11,155 --> 00:33:13,824
I said I'm sorry,
and I meant it.

663
00:33:15,702 --> 00:33:16,702
Harvey.

664
00:33:17,203 --> 00:33:20,288
I want you to trust...
I need you to trust me. Okay?

665
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:21,915
And I will work
as hard as I can,

666
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:24,334
as long as it takes,
to make that happen.

667
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:26,837
I mean, you... You don't
even have to pay me, all right?

668
00:33:26,963 --> 00:33:28,463
I'll work for free.

669
00:33:30,633 --> 00:33:31,967
For free.

670
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:33,760
Well, I meant...
Not forever.

671
00:33:33,886 --> 00:33:35,095
Just, like, as a probationary thing.
But...

672
00:33:35,221 --> 00:33:36,680
Donna, tell Wyatt
I'm on my way over.

673
00:33:36,806 --> 00:33:38,265
You never have to press
a button on that thing?

674
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:41,518
Got it. And Jessica wants
to see Mike in her office right now.

675
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:46,273
Louis told me
what you did at the club.

676
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:49,234
I bet he didn't tell you
the whole story.

677
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:52,404
He told me enough
to impress me.

678
00:33:56,409 --> 00:33:58,160
New business is hard.

679
00:33:58,619 --> 00:34:00,037
People will promise
you the world.

680
00:34:00,163 --> 00:34:02,372
But until they sign
that engagement letter,

681
00:34:02,498 --> 00:34:04,416
it means nothing.

682
00:34:05,752 --> 00:34:08,754
Now, I don't know
what you told Tom Keller,

683
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:11,465
but bringing a client in
at your age,

684
00:34:11,924 --> 00:34:13,258
that reminds me
of Harvey.

685
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:16,970
Jessica.
Before we get started,

686
00:34:17,096 --> 00:34:19,264
there's something in the retainer
that Tom pointed out.

687
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:21,099
It's not a big deal, really.
We were just...

688
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:22,267
No, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

689
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:24,311
Like I said,
we're here to make you happy.

690
00:34:24,437 --> 00:34:25,812
Right?

691
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:33,153
I thought you wanted nothing
to do with him.

692
00:34:33,279 --> 00:34:35,655
I didn't.
But then, I thought about it.

693
00:34:35,782 --> 00:34:37,532
He might not be
a very good person,

694
00:34:37,658 --> 00:34:40,786
but a little deviousness is the sort
of thing you look for in a good lawyer.

695
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:42,829
I mean, the other guy I was with,
he was too nice.

696
00:34:42,955 --> 00:34:45,332
We were buddies.
We went to school together.

697
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:47,834
It's time I grew up.
You know, got a real shark.

698
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:51,421
Well, I had no intention
of being that way to get your business.

699
00:34:51,547 --> 00:34:54,800
That's exactly why I insisted
that you be my point man.

700
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:58,136
I want someone being devious for me,
not to me.

701
00:35:00,264 --> 00:35:01,431
What?

702
00:35:01,557 --> 00:35:04,309
It's just... Louis never
would have told Jessica that I existed,

703
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:05,310
let alone
that I helped him,

704
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:06,728
if you hadn't done that.

705
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:08,647
Hey,
the way I see it,

706
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:11,024
the three of us stick together,
we'll make a pretty good team.

707
00:35:14,487 --> 00:35:15,904
You know,
I've got a better idea.

708
00:35:16,322 --> 00:35:17,656
$20 million?

709
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:19,825
They claim it's their final offer.

710
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:21,952
That's what it cost
to make the prototype.

711
00:35:22,078 --> 00:35:25,872
Not to mention my entire savings
and two years of my life.

712
00:35:25,998 --> 00:35:27,207
Wyatt.

713
00:35:27,875 --> 00:35:30,127
They know we're stalled
on our injunction.

714
00:35:30,253 --> 00:35:33,004
Which means, to them,
they're giving you a fair price

715
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:35,173
as an insurance policy
against the risk

716
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:37,759
of possibly losing
the interference claim.

717
00:35:37,885 --> 00:35:40,137
I don't care
what it is to them.

718
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:41,763
It's not fair.

719
00:35:44,058 --> 00:35:46,726
Well, fair or not,
it's their final offer.

720
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:52,858
You think
I should take it?

721
00:35:54,193 --> 00:35:57,404
I think you should tell them
to shove it up their ass.

722
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:03,160
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm
terribly sorry, but we have a problem.

723
00:36:04,203 --> 00:36:05,453
What problem?

724
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,330
We came down here
because you led us to believe

725
00:36:07,456 --> 00:36:09,624
that your client was ready
to accept our settlement agreement.

726
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:11,501
And I thought he would.

727
00:36:11,627 --> 00:36:13,211
Look,
I took him the offer.

728
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:16,173
I presented it to him
and recommended that he take it.

729
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:17,507
In fact,
I urged him to take it.

730
00:36:17,633 --> 00:36:19,176
You know
what he told me to do?

731
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:21,595
He told me to tell you
to shove it up your ass.

732
00:36:25,641 --> 00:36:27,809
Now, I know you didn't have me
come all the way down here

733
00:36:27,935 --> 00:36:29,186
just to tell me that.

734
00:36:29,562 --> 00:36:31,605
You're right.
That's not all Wyatt said.

735
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:34,900
He said, rather than spending years
fighting this out in court,

736
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:39,154
in 48 hours,
he's going to put this online.

737
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:44,492
It's a little rough,
but you get the idea.

738
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:46,286
What are you showing us?
Is this a website?

739
00:36:46,412 --> 00:36:48,872
Available
at the Suntech domain name.

740
00:36:48,998 --> 00:36:51,374
All the design plans and calculations
have been uploaded.

741
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,084
- Is this online now?
- It can be.

742
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:55,670
Which means the whole world
will have access to my designs.

743
00:36:55,796 --> 00:36:57,547
There will be
10 knock-offs of that phone

744
00:36:57,673 --> 00:36:59,966
before you can catch a cab
back to your headquarters.

745
00:37:00,092 --> 00:37:01,718
We could file
an injunction.

746
00:37:01,844 --> 00:37:02,928
Not before tomorrow.

747
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:05,222
And once that technology
is out there,

748
00:37:05,348 --> 00:37:07,015
good luck
putting that genie back in the bottle.

749
00:37:07,141 --> 00:37:08,099
Well, then we'll sue.

750
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:10,185
But my client
won't have any money.

751
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:12,812
What he will have is credit
for the initial design.

752
00:37:12,939 --> 00:37:15,899
Which, after he incorporates
under a different name,

753
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:17,734
will be worth
a hell of a lot more money

754
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:19,861
than the $20 million
that you're offering.

755
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:27,369
And you're saying
that this was all your client's idea.

756
00:37:29,997 --> 00:37:31,122
Yes.

757
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:33,667
That's what I'm saying.

758
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:38,296
That's good.
I think so, too.

759
00:37:39,048 --> 00:37:40,590
But, uh...
I'll see you tomorrow.

760
00:37:40,716 --> 00:37:42,133
Good night.

761
00:37:48,557 --> 00:37:49,599
Thought you
weren't coming.

762
00:37:49,725 --> 00:37:51,893
I had to settle
a case first.

763
00:37:53,187 --> 00:37:54,813
You have the paperwork
we talked about?

764
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:05,448
What is this?

765
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:08,493
It's a copy
of the judicial conduct codes.

766
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:10,412
A friend of mine works
at the Attorney General's office.

767
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:12,664
He gave it to me.
We had a nice chat about you.

768
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:15,709
I told him if you were
willing to blackmail someone once,

769
00:38:15,835 --> 00:38:17,919
chances are,
you've done it before.

770
00:38:18,045 --> 00:38:19,629
He's very anxious
to meet you.

771
00:38:19,755 --> 00:38:21,631
You think you can get away
with screwing my wife

772
00:38:21,757 --> 00:38:23,049
and then
have me investigated?

773
00:38:23,175 --> 00:38:24,759
You actually have it
the wrong way around.

774
00:38:24,885 --> 00:38:28,847
The only thing I've done so far
is have you investigated.

775
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:30,890
What?

776
00:38:31,017 --> 00:38:33,310
I never actually
slept with Lauren.

777
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:34,686
But I knew
you'd never believe me,

778
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:36,229
so I kept
my mouth shut.

779
00:38:36,355 --> 00:38:38,023
But now that she's getting
a divorce,

780
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:40,066
my policy
no longer applies.

781
00:38:40,192 --> 00:38:43,361
And, of course,
she's free to date whoever she pleases.

782
00:38:44,572 --> 00:38:46,489
And she pleases me.

783
00:38:47,616 --> 00:38:49,784
Enjoy your evening,
Donald.

784
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:15,810
I always heard
about this place.

785
00:39:15,936 --> 00:39:17,270
Which room
is Hoffa buried in?

786
00:39:17,396 --> 00:39:18,855
Not sure.

787
00:39:18,981 --> 00:39:22,567
But the Ark of the Covenant
is just down the hall on the left.

788
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:25,987
When you're finished down here,
I'd like you to come upstairs

789
00:39:26,113 --> 00:39:29,657
and start putting together
a settlement memorandum.

790
00:39:29,784 --> 00:39:30,909
They went for it?

791
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:32,077
Thanks to your idea.

792
00:39:32,953 --> 00:39:34,162
Well, I mean,
it wasn't really my idea.

793
00:39:34,288 --> 00:39:35,789
They're settling
for 400 million.

794
00:39:35,915 --> 00:39:37,415
Okay.
Yeah, that was my idea.

795
00:39:39,752 --> 00:39:41,294
So, does this mean
I get to keep my job?

796
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:43,213
- I want to talk to you about that.
- Before you do, Harvey...

797
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:45,882
Do we have to have a conversation
about how you keep interrupting me?

798
00:39:46,008 --> 00:39:47,008
Ah.

799
00:39:47,927 --> 00:39:51,054
Look. Sometimes,
when someone pulls a gun on you,

800
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:54,015
instead of bullets,
it's filled with blanks.

801
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,101
What's this?

802
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:58,812
It's a copy
of your drug test results.

803
00:39:58,938 --> 00:40:00,063
But this says I passed.

804
00:40:00,189 --> 00:40:01,439
You did.

805
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:05,026
Louis showed me a fake?

806
00:40:05,152 --> 00:40:06,694
I'm going to go
have a talk with him.

807
00:40:08,656 --> 00:40:11,241
You know what?
Why don't you let me do it?

808
00:40:12,118 --> 00:40:14,077
You think
you're ready for the adult table?

809
00:40:14,203 --> 00:40:17,288
Well, didn't you hear?
I just landed my first client.

810
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:18,706
Why do you think
I'm showing you this now

811
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:20,291
and not going
straight to Louis?

812
00:40:23,879 --> 00:40:24,838
Go easy on him.

813
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:26,423
No.

814
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:28,091
Good boy.

815
00:40:31,512 --> 00:40:32,429
You lied.

816
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:34,973
That other drug test
you showed me was a fake.

817
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:36,182
How did you
figure that out?

818
00:40:36,308 --> 00:40:37,976
Someone once told me
I have an eye for detail

819
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:40,145
when it comes to important paperwork.

820
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:41,479
Well, maybe you're not as good as
you think you are,

821
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:43,148
or you would have caught it sooner.

822
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:47,235
Okay. So this was all some sort of test?
You blackmail me. You jeopardize my job.

823
00:40:47,361 --> 00:40:48,528
Mike, stop.

824
00:40:49,029 --> 00:40:51,656
Stop.
We all came out ahead, didn't we?

825
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:53,283
That new client
is going to bring us millions.

826
00:40:53,409 --> 00:40:56,953
Jessica knows your name now.
It's a win-win.

827
00:40:59,498 --> 00:41:02,417
You're right.
She does know my name.

828
00:41:03,752 --> 00:41:07,547
Which is why she'll listen
when I tell her exactly what happened.

829
00:41:09,049 --> 00:41:11,092
Okay.
But before you do that,

830
00:41:11,218 --> 00:41:13,470
it is that time again,
isn't it?

831
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:15,597
What time?

832
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:18,057
"Pee in a cup" time.

833
00:41:20,269 --> 00:41:21,686
And now,
you know I'd fail.

834
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:22,937
Of course,
you can run to Mommy,

835
00:41:23,063 --> 00:41:24,564
tell her your story,
and take your chances.

836
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:26,483
Or you can
take the test

837
00:41:26,609 --> 00:41:30,403
and trust that I'll keep it to myself
as my way of thanking you.

838
00:41:42,708 --> 00:41:44,667
Oh, you know,
I actually did some reading

839
00:41:44,793 --> 00:41:47,921
of the Pearson Hardman drug policy,
as well.

840
00:41:48,047 --> 00:41:50,131
It turns out
that you have to wait three months

841
00:41:50,257 --> 00:41:52,383
before you can request
another drug test.

842
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:56,137
It's a little detail you might
have missed. So, drink up.

843
00:41:58,390 --> 00:42:00,850
Oh, and, uh,
I spoke to Tom Keller.

844
00:42:00,976 --> 00:42:02,519
He says that he feels
he'd be best served

845
00:42:02,645 --> 00:42:04,979
with the combination
of me and Harvey.

846
00:42:05,105 --> 00:42:08,024
I think you'll get
that call in the morning.
