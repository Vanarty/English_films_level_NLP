1
00:00:07,509 --> 00:00:09,143
You took a case on contingency

2
00:00:09,178 --> 00:00:11,178
where every plaintiff
is dirt poor.

3
00:00:11,213 --> 00:00:12,146
Dump it.

4
00:00:12,181 --> 00:00:13,847
One of the victims
was my uncle Keith.

5
00:00:13,883 --> 00:00:15,783
Please, these people
need your help.

6
00:00:15,818 --> 00:00:17,918
They need someone like you
to fight for them,

7
00:00:17,953 --> 00:00:19,453
and I can't do it.

8
00:00:19,488 --> 00:00:21,155
Then what do you say
we do it together?

9
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:22,322
I'd like to propose a change

10
00:00:22,358 --> 00:00:24,224
to the current
compensation formula.

11
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:25,692
How many partners
do you have in your pocket

12
00:00:25,728 --> 00:00:26,894
if we put your proposal
to a vote?

13
00:00:26,929 --> 00:00:28,362
I can get 45%.

14
00:00:28,397 --> 00:00:29,530
I'm gonna get you
the difference.

15
00:00:29,565 --> 00:00:31,365
This is Harvey's
last three income statements,

16
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,000
and I found them sitting
in the copy machine.

17
00:00:33,035 --> 00:00:34,268
You came to work for me,

18
00:00:34,303 --> 00:00:35,569
so now it's time
for you to decide.

19
00:00:35,621 --> 00:00:36,537
Are you with me or not?

20
00:00:36,572 --> 00:00:38,505
I just called
for a vote tomorrow,

21
00:00:38,541 --> 00:00:40,141
and I hope you've been
saving your money,

22
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:42,342
because your gravy train's
about to leave the station.

23
00:00:55,224 --> 00:00:57,191
Oh, hello.

24
00:00:57,243 --> 00:00:58,792
- I was just...
- Working.

25
00:00:58,828 --> 00:01:01,328
I see that,
but it's 7:30 in the morning.

26
00:01:01,363 --> 00:01:03,297
What are you doing here
so early?

27
00:01:03,299 --> 00:01:05,999
I like to get in
before the chaos starts.

28
00:01:06,035 --> 00:01:07,568
Tell you the truth,
I was under the impression

29
00:01:07,603 --> 00:01:09,736
that you wouldn't get in
till much later.

30
00:01:09,772 --> 00:01:11,171
I wanted to get a jump
on the day.

31
00:01:11,207 --> 00:01:13,974
Then maybe you should get
a jump on this.

32
00:01:14,009 --> 00:01:15,909
Why am I paying
Louis's laundry bill?

33
00:01:15,945 --> 00:01:17,044
Because if you pay it,

34
00:01:17,079 --> 00:01:18,812
he won't know
that we triple-starched

35
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:19,880
all of his shirts.

36
00:01:19,915 --> 00:01:21,315
- We?
- Yes, we.

37
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:23,550
He came after us.
We're coming after him.

38
00:01:23,586 --> 00:01:25,252
Did you think
I wouldn't have your back?

39
00:01:25,287 --> 00:01:26,287
You want the truth?

40
00:01:26,322 --> 00:01:27,688
I thought
you'd be asking for a raise

41
00:01:27,723 --> 00:01:29,056
after seeing how much I make.

42
00:01:29,091 --> 00:01:30,624
I didn't look
at how much you make.

43
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:31,859
And as far as I'm concerned,

44
00:01:31,894 --> 00:01:34,094
anyone who did should be fired.

45
00:01:34,129 --> 00:01:35,579
You're all right, Gretchen.

46
00:01:35,631 --> 00:01:36,964
But for the time being,

47
00:01:36,999 --> 00:01:39,283
don't play any more jokes
on Louis.

48
00:01:39,318 --> 00:01:40,667
Mind if I ask why?

49
00:01:40,703 --> 00:01:42,069
Because I only play jokes
on people

50
00:01:42,104 --> 00:01:43,670
to express my affection
for them,

51
00:01:43,706 --> 00:01:47,207
and right now I have
no affection for Louis Litt.

52
00:01:49,111 --> 00:01:51,311
Looks like I got here
just in time.

53
00:01:51,313 --> 00:01:52,746
And why is that?

54
00:01:52,748 --> 00:01:54,014
Because I'm going
to ask you to do something

55
00:01:54,049 --> 00:01:55,315
you're not going to want to do,

56
00:01:55,351 --> 00:01:56,750
only this time
you're going to do it.

57
00:01:56,752 --> 00:01:58,218
What didn't I do last time?

58
00:01:58,254 --> 00:02:01,288
I told you to apologize
to Louis.

59
00:02:01,323 --> 00:02:03,891
And I did, right before
he held hands with Jack Soloff

60
00:02:03,926 --> 00:02:06,076
and cut my earnings
in front of the entire firm.

61
00:02:06,111 --> 00:02:07,678
And if you hadn't have been
such a dick to Jack

62
00:02:07,713 --> 00:02:08,829
in the first place,

63
00:02:08,864 --> 00:02:10,597
Louis would have had
nowhere to go.

64
00:02:10,633 --> 00:02:12,199
This isn't about Louis, is it?

65
00:02:12,234 --> 00:02:13,300
No, it isn't.

66
00:02:13,335 --> 00:02:14,801
I want you to bury
the hatchet with Jack.

67
00:02:14,837 --> 00:02:16,136
You mean you want me
to kiss his ass.

68
00:02:16,171 --> 00:02:17,571
I mean I want you
to figure out a way

69
00:02:17,606 --> 00:02:19,873
to make peace with a partner
whose influence is on the rise.

70
00:02:19,909 --> 00:02:21,141
That's kissing his ass.

71
00:02:21,143 --> 00:02:22,442
Well, if that's how
you want to look at it,

72
00:02:22,478 --> 00:02:24,945
then pucker up,
because that man is a threat,

73
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:26,313
and he's aligned with Louis,

74
00:02:26,348 --> 00:02:28,782
and I am in no mood
for a power struggle.

75
00:02:38,093 --> 00:02:39,543
- Hey.
- Hey.

76
00:02:39,595 --> 00:02:41,044
I didn't hear you leave today.

77
00:02:41,096 --> 00:02:42,696
That's because I left
at 5:00 in the morning,

78
00:02:42,731 --> 00:02:44,247
trying to get an early start
on this case.

79
00:02:44,283 --> 00:02:46,049
Mm.

80
00:02:46,085 --> 00:02:47,968
Uh, about that...

81
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:49,636
I didn't want to say
anything last night

82
00:02:49,672 --> 00:02:51,271
because you were so excited...

83
00:02:51,307 --> 00:02:54,041
But you're worried about me
working with your father.

84
00:02:54,076 --> 00:02:55,409
- Yes.
- Hmm.

85
00:02:55,444 --> 00:02:57,244
Mike, you're the two most
important men in my life.

86
00:02:57,279 --> 00:03:00,047
Neither of you back down
from a fight,

87
00:03:00,082 --> 00:03:01,648
and I'm just...

88
00:03:01,684 --> 00:03:03,951
I'm afraid you're gonna
end up hating each other.

89
00:03:07,289 --> 00:03:08,855
Rachel, do you hate your father?

90
00:03:08,891 --> 00:03:10,757
Of course not.
I love my dad.

91
00:03:10,793 --> 00:03:13,126
And don't you have conflicts
with him all the time?

92
00:03:13,162 --> 00:03:15,879
Yes, I do, but it's different.

93
00:03:15,914 --> 00:03:17,297
He's my family.

94
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:19,433
Yeah, he's gonna be
my family too.

95
00:03:19,468 --> 00:03:21,118
And if I'm lucky,
I'm gonna fight with him

96
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:23,136
about a lot of things
over the years.

97
00:03:23,172 --> 00:03:24,538
So why not start with a fight

98
00:03:24,573 --> 00:03:26,206
where we're both
on the same side?

99
00:03:26,241 --> 00:03:29,810
Okay, I trust you.

100
00:03:29,845 --> 00:03:31,912
Good.

101
00:03:31,947 --> 00:03:35,115
[upbeat music]

102
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,636
Jessica, you have a minute?

103
00:03:39,672 --> 00:03:41,254
I do if you're here to tell me

104
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:42,856
why Robert Zane
is sitting in the lobby

105
00:03:42,891 --> 00:03:44,391
with an appointment to see you.

106
00:03:44,426 --> 00:03:45,892
'Cause I'm pretty sure
he's not taking time

107
00:03:45,928 --> 00:03:47,794
out of his busy morning
to talk about centerpieces.

108
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:49,863
No, he's not.

109
00:03:49,898 --> 00:03:53,967
He is here to co-counsel
the Kelton case.

110
00:03:54,003 --> 00:03:56,236
You mean the case
I explicitly told you to drop?

111
00:03:56,271 --> 00:03:58,972
I mean the case that you said
would cost a fortune to fund

112
00:03:58,974 --> 00:04:01,074
and you didn't wanna lay out
that kind of money for.

113
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:03,143
I didn't want to lay it out
because this case is a loser.

114
00:04:03,195 --> 00:04:04,444
And I'm telling you it's not.

115
00:04:04,496 --> 00:04:06,847
And even if it is,
I just took away our downside.

116
00:04:06,882 --> 00:04:09,516
By going behind my back
to our biggest competitor.

117
00:04:09,551 --> 00:04:11,284
Are you telling me that
you're scared of Robert Zane?

118
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,819
I'd be a fool if I wasn't.

119
00:04:12,855 --> 00:04:14,488
And you're a fool if you're not.

120
00:04:14,523 --> 00:04:15,789
We let that man into our house,

121
00:04:15,824 --> 00:04:16,823
there's no telling
what he'll do.

122
00:04:16,859 --> 00:04:17,891
You know what, Jessica?

123
00:04:17,926 --> 00:04:18,992
If Harvey had done this,
you'd be pissed,

124
00:04:19,028 --> 00:04:19,960
but you'd let him do it anyway.

125
00:04:19,995 --> 00:04:21,395
And you may be as cocky as him,

126
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:24,931
but you are not Harvey.

127
00:04:24,967 --> 00:04:27,284
No, you're right.
I'm sorry.

128
00:04:27,336 --> 00:04:28,635
I guess I'll just go tell Robert

129
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:30,587
that we won't be working
together on this after all.

130
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:33,106
You know damn well
if we tell him that now,

131
00:04:33,108 --> 00:04:35,709
I look weak.

132
00:04:35,761 --> 00:04:37,411
So maybe I am as good as Harvey.

133
00:04:37,446 --> 00:04:39,579
Well, sometimes
that's not a good thing.

134
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:42,549
Where are you going?

135
00:04:42,601 --> 00:04:44,568
To get
some goddamn strength back.

136
00:04:47,322 --> 00:04:48,922
Then go ahead and do it.

137
00:04:48,974 --> 00:04:50,273
I won't just take you
to the woodshed.

138
00:04:50,309 --> 00:04:52,759
I'll leave you there, dead.

139
00:04:54,997 --> 00:04:56,830
Well, looks like you're
making yourself comfortable

140
00:04:56,832 --> 00:04:58,565
in my offices.

141
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,667
About as comfortable
as possible in these chairs.

142
00:05:00,702 --> 00:05:02,469
You ever hear of lumbar support?

143
00:05:02,504 --> 00:05:05,205
I get it.
You like stodgy and functional.

144
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:08,442
But these are my chairs,
just like this is my case.

145
00:05:08,477 --> 00:05:10,777
What exactly are you
doing here, Jessica?

146
00:05:10,813 --> 00:05:11,813
I'm here to tell you

147
00:05:11,814 --> 00:05:13,013
we're taking
half the contingency.

148
00:05:13,048 --> 00:05:14,948
And I'm here to respond.
I'm giving you 1/3.

149
00:05:14,983 --> 00:05:16,249
We brought this case to you.

150
00:05:16,285 --> 00:05:18,085
After you found it in a box
crying for its mama.

151
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,653
Plus, I'm footing the bill,

152
00:05:19,688 --> 00:05:21,855
which means
this fee discussion is over.

153
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:24,991
Well, this fee discussion
may be over,

154
00:05:25,027 --> 00:05:29,362
but the power discussion
is just getting started.

155
00:05:29,398 --> 00:05:31,965
You don't give a shit
about the money, do you?

156
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,567
On this particular case,

157
00:05:33,602 --> 00:05:36,002
all I give a shit about
is keeping you in check.

158
00:05:36,038 --> 00:05:38,305
Which means, for the duration
of this matter,

159
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:40,674
you will be treating
Mike Ross like a partner.

160
00:05:40,709 --> 00:05:42,209
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

161
00:05:42,244 --> 00:05:43,777
That boy barely shaves.

162
00:05:43,812 --> 00:05:44,978
I don't care
if he's still in diapers.

163
00:05:45,013 --> 00:05:46,313
He's representing my firm,

164
00:05:46,348 --> 00:05:47,814
which means
he's representing me.

165
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:50,951
You look at him, you see me.

166
00:05:50,986 --> 00:05:53,086
You're asking
for a hell of a lot.

167
00:05:53,122 --> 00:05:54,321
Then take your wingtips
off my table

168
00:05:54,356 --> 00:05:55,356
and walk 'em out the door,

169
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:57,023
because this is my case

170
00:05:57,059 --> 00:05:59,179
and you either do it my way
or you don't do it at all.

171
00:06:01,029 --> 00:06:02,829
Mm.

172
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,701
I love you.

173
00:06:07,736 --> 00:06:11,338
♪ See the money,
wanna stay for your meal ♪

174
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:14,674

Louis, it's not my birthday.

I know, but I know
that you weren't happy

188
00:06:51,947 --> 00:06:54,281
with the position I put you in
regarding Harvey's compensation,

00:06:54,317 --> 00:06:55,983
so I just wanted to make sure

know the truth?

I'm saying that I don't like
what I did,

- Like what?
- With disgust.

208
00:07:41,597 --> 00:07:43,097
'Cause Harvey's got
autographed basketballs

209
00:07:43,132 --> 00:07:44,264
and vintage records,

210
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:47,868

Look, I don't know
what kind of teenage nonsense

220
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:05,986
you got going on with him,
but I don't do that shit.

Meet you down in the lobby

00:08:12,061 --> 00:08:14,428
I take it that means that
things went well with Jessica?

225
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:16,263
Yep, she signed off,
and all I had to do

226
00:08:16,298 --> 00:08:19,700
was agree to treat you
as a full and equal partner.

227
00:08:19,735 --> 00:08:21,235
Whoa, that must have hurt.

228
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:22,770
Eh, it didn't hurt a bit, 'cause
I didn't mean it with her,

229
00:08:22,805 --> 00:08:24,371
and I'm not gonna do it
with you.

230
00:08:24,407 --> 00:08:26,173
See you in 10.

231
00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:28,776
Better make that 15.

232
00:08:35,334 --> 00:08:36,583
Heard you're looking for me.

233
00:08:36,585 --> 00:08:39,186
I was, because I wanted
to give you this.

234
00:08:39,221 --> 00:08:40,154
What's that?

235
00:08:40,189 --> 00:08:41,955
Directions to
Westchester Country Club.

236
00:08:41,991 --> 00:08:43,590
Why are you giving them to me?

237
00:08:43,626 --> 00:08:45,692
Because I don't want you to be
late to your 11:30 tee time

238
00:08:45,728 --> 00:08:47,428
with Charles Barkley.

239
00:08:47,463 --> 00:08:49,596
I'm playing golf
with Charles Barkley?

240
00:08:49,598 --> 00:08:51,365
If you get there on time,
you are.

241
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,933
If not and he starts whacking
at shit with his big club,

242
00:08:52,968 --> 00:08:53,884
he might kill someone.

243
00:08:53,936 --> 00:08:55,202
You'll miss the whole thing.

244
00:08:55,237 --> 00:08:57,838
You think I don't know
what you're doing?

245
00:08:57,873 --> 00:08:59,973
You're sucking up to me
'cause all of a sudden

246
00:09:00,009 --> 00:09:01,508
you realized I'm someone
to be reckoned with.

247
00:09:01,544 --> 00:09:02,709
That is what I'm doing.

248
00:09:02,761 --> 00:09:05,379
But you're a big golfer
and a bigger Barkley fan,

249
00:09:05,381 --> 00:09:07,881
and I thought we could use this
to get off to a fresh start.

250
00:09:07,933 --> 00:09:09,266
Here's the problem, Harvey.

251
00:09:09,301 --> 00:09:11,885
I don't give a shit
about Charles Barkley,

252
00:09:11,887 --> 00:09:13,520
and you don't give a shit
about me.

253
00:09:13,556 --> 00:09:15,722
Listen to me.
This is a gesture.

254
00:09:15,724 --> 00:09:16,857
Take it.

255
00:09:16,892 --> 00:09:18,358
I'm not gonna take it,

256
00:09:18,394 --> 00:09:19,693
and I'm gonna tell you why.

257
00:09:19,728 --> 00:09:21,061
Because you've never
treated me like a peer.

258
00:09:21,113 --> 00:09:24,481
You've only ever treated me
like competition.

259
00:09:24,533 --> 00:09:27,901
I'm trying very hard here.

260
00:09:27,953 --> 00:09:31,121
Well, you can stop trying,
because I'm not interested.

261
00:09:39,165 --> 00:09:41,882
Mr. Specter,
I swear he told me

262
00:09:41,917 --> 00:09:43,800
he was
a huge Charles Barkley fan.

263
00:09:43,836 --> 00:09:46,503
I'm sure he did,
but the problem is he lied,

264
00:09:46,555 --> 00:09:48,005
and you should've known it.

265
00:09:55,481 --> 00:09:56,930
Whatever you're doing,
put it back.

266
00:09:56,932 --> 00:09:58,849
- I need you.
- I can't.

267
00:09:58,901 --> 00:10:00,901
What do you mean, you can't?
We're about to go to war.

268
00:10:00,936 --> 00:10:02,653
I mean, I'm about
to go to war myself.

269
00:10:02,688 --> 00:10:03,937
What the hell
are you talking about?

270
00:10:03,939 --> 00:10:05,272
I'm taking a case
against Kelton Insurance.

271
00:10:05,324 --> 00:10:06,940
I gotta go meet the client
right now.

272
00:10:06,942 --> 00:10:08,158
Who the hell authorized that?

273
00:10:08,194 --> 00:10:09,194
Jessica.

274
00:10:09,195 --> 00:10:10,861
You went to Jessica
instead of me?

275
00:10:10,913 --> 00:10:12,996
I didn't go to anyone,
all right?

276
00:10:13,032 --> 00:10:14,665
She came to me after I took it.

277
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,366
Well, I'm telling you, you're
gonna have to postpone it.

278
00:10:16,418 --> 00:10:18,001
Harvey, this case is important.

279
00:10:18,037 --> 00:10:19,453
I'll tell you what's important.

280
00:10:19,455 --> 00:10:21,505
I got a partner at this firm
coming at me.

281
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:23,840
Well, I didn't know that
when I committed to this.

282
00:10:23,876 --> 00:10:25,459
What the hell? I thought
we were meeting in the lobby.

283
00:10:25,511 --> 00:10:27,511
You gotta be kidding me.
Your case is with him?

284
00:10:27,546 --> 00:10:28,929
You're damn right it's with me.

285
00:10:28,964 --> 00:10:31,298
And we have
a first impression to make.

286
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:32,883
I don't know what kind of law
you're teaching around here,

287
00:10:32,935 --> 00:10:34,768
but where I come from,
you show up on time.

288
00:10:34,803 --> 00:10:37,221
Let's go.

289
00:10:37,273 --> 00:10:38,205
You wanna go?

290
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,573
Go.

291
00:10:46,832 --> 00:10:49,249
Jessica, what can I do for you?

292
00:10:49,301 --> 00:10:50,884
You came to me
for some legal advice.

293
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,252
Now I'm coming to you for yours.

294
00:10:52,288 --> 00:10:54,121
Do I get to charge you for it?

295
00:10:54,156 --> 00:10:56,123
You already do,
unless you suddenly

296
00:10:56,158 --> 00:10:58,158
started paying for law school
out of your own pocket.

297
00:10:58,193 --> 00:10:59,826
Free of charge it is.

298
00:10:59,862 --> 00:11:01,495
I want you to look this over

299
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:04,898
and tell me if we have
any exposure.

300
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:06,667
Okay, but this isn't a deal.

301
00:11:06,702 --> 00:11:07,702
This is a speech.

302
00:11:07,703 --> 00:11:08,769
I'm aware of that,

303
00:11:08,804 --> 00:11:10,370
but Gwen Barnes
is quite opinionated,

304
00:11:10,406 --> 00:11:11,805
and I don't want her
to say something

305
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,240
that might get her sued.

306
00:11:13,275 --> 00:11:15,108
Dr. Gwendolyn Barnes?

307
00:11:15,144 --> 00:11:16,577
Do you have a problem with her?

308
00:11:16,612 --> 00:11:18,378
No, not at all.
How much time do I have?

309
00:11:18,414 --> 00:11:19,646
Take as long as you want.

310
00:11:19,682 --> 00:11:21,362
Just make sure
whenever I come back for it,

311
00:11:21,367 --> 00:11:22,950
it's done.

312
00:11:24,453 --> 00:11:25,419
(Harvey)
What are you doing in here?

313
00:11:25,421 --> 00:11:26,803
I came to apologize.

314
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:28,589
You don't need to apologize.

315
00:11:28,641 --> 00:11:29,890
I was out of line.

316
00:11:29,892 --> 00:11:32,159
Soloff's an asshole,
and it wasn't your fault.

317
00:11:32,194 --> 00:11:35,445
No, you were right.
It was my fault.

318
00:11:35,497 --> 00:11:37,364
Well, what's done is done.

319
00:11:37,416 --> 00:11:39,950
If you don't mind,
I need to think right now.

320
00:11:40,002 --> 00:11:43,370
I'm sorry, Mr. Specter,
but what's done is not done.

321
00:11:43,422 --> 00:11:44,621
What are you talking about?

322
00:11:44,673 --> 00:11:47,874
I told you, I got your back.

323
00:11:47,926 --> 00:11:49,426
What the hell is this?

324
00:11:49,461 --> 00:11:52,379
It's the bio of that asshole's
third biggest client.

325
00:11:52,431 --> 00:11:54,915
- And?
- Look where he's from.

326
00:12:08,121 --> 00:12:10,922
I appreciate you coming
all the way down here,

327
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:12,624
but the last time
you came to me,

328
00:12:12,659 --> 00:12:15,260
you told me to sit tight,
and that was a week ago.

329
00:12:15,295 --> 00:12:17,229
Emma, I don't understand.

330
00:12:17,264 --> 00:12:18,296
What did you expect?

331
00:12:18,332 --> 00:12:20,132
I expected you to understand
what it feels like

332
00:12:20,167 --> 00:12:22,367
to be left hanging.

333
00:12:23,871 --> 00:12:25,303
Because if we can't
understand that,

334
00:12:25,339 --> 00:12:28,306
what's to stop us
from cutting and running

335
00:12:28,342 --> 00:12:29,841
when things get tough?

336
00:12:29,877 --> 00:12:31,960
And what is gonna stop you?

337
00:12:32,012 --> 00:12:34,079
I know what's gonna stop me.

338
00:12:34,114 --> 00:12:38,049
First year... you think
about it every day.

339
00:12:40,354 --> 00:12:43,755
You relive it.

340
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:45,006
Doesn't matter what you do.

341
00:12:45,058 --> 00:12:47,859
You can't get it
out of your head.

342
00:12:47,911 --> 00:12:50,495
People tell you
it's part of God's plan.

343
00:12:50,531 --> 00:12:53,498
Maybe they're right,
but it doesn't stop you

344
00:12:53,534 --> 00:12:54,866
from wanting
to punch them in the face

345
00:12:54,902 --> 00:12:56,835
every time they say it.

346
00:12:56,870 --> 00:13:00,172
Then time passes,

347
00:13:00,207 --> 00:13:03,141
two, three years.

348
00:13:03,177 --> 00:13:06,645
Maybe you even start
to feel normal.

349
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:07,913
Maybe you start to believe

350
00:13:07,948 --> 00:13:12,484
that maybe this thing
won't actually scar you

351
00:13:12,519 --> 00:13:14,019
for the rest of your life.

352
00:13:14,054 --> 00:13:16,321
But then one day,

353
00:13:16,356 --> 00:13:18,623
something reminds you.

354
00:13:18,659 --> 00:13:22,460
A song or a...
or a smell.

355
00:13:24,498 --> 00:13:26,364
And it touches that nerve,
and all of a sudden,

356
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:29,334
it's the day you got that news
all over again.

357
00:13:29,369 --> 00:13:32,971
So you have gone through
something like this yourself?

358
00:13:38,512 --> 00:13:42,314
I haven't just gone through it.

359
00:13:42,349 --> 00:13:44,983
It's the entire reason
that I became a lawyer.

360
00:13:47,938 --> 00:13:49,955
And as far as it taking
as long as it did,

361
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:53,792
it took a while
to work out the particulars.

362
00:13:53,827 --> 00:13:56,995
But I can assure you,

363
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:58,530
it's worth the wait,

364
00:13:58,565 --> 00:14:00,865
because this right here,

365
00:14:00,901 --> 00:14:05,437
this is an all-star team,
and we're playing for you.

366
00:14:08,175 --> 00:14:09,941
Well...

367
00:14:14,231 --> 00:14:16,481
Where do I sign?

368
00:14:16,516 --> 00:14:18,550
All right,
we got that taken care of.

369
00:14:18,602 --> 00:14:19,602
Next step?

370
00:14:19,603 --> 00:14:20,936
Set up a settlement conference.

371
00:14:20,971 --> 00:14:22,270
Got that right.

372
00:14:22,322 --> 00:14:24,406
You mean "You got that right,
partner."

373
00:14:24,441 --> 00:14:25,573
What the hell
are you talking about?

374
00:14:25,626 --> 00:14:26,992
You're the one
that said it yourself.

375
00:14:27,044 --> 00:14:28,793
You and me,
we're the all-star team.

376
00:14:28,829 --> 00:14:31,129
I meant I was the all-star.
You're the team.

377
00:14:31,131 --> 00:14:32,213
Oh, so I guess in this case

378
00:14:32,266 --> 00:14:34,215
the team just hit
the game-winning jumper.

379
00:14:34,268 --> 00:14:35,684
I got news for you, team,

380
00:14:35,736 --> 00:14:38,436
the game hasn't
even started yet.

381
00:14:38,438 --> 00:14:40,905
Mike, seriously, back there,

382
00:14:40,941 --> 00:14:43,842
about your childhood,
I didn't really get it before.

383
00:14:43,877 --> 00:14:45,210
You got dealt a bad hand,

384
00:14:45,245 --> 00:14:46,478
and you pulled yourself up
by your bootstraps,

385
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:47,612
and I respect that.

386
00:14:47,648 --> 00:14:49,281
Thanks, Robert.

387
00:14:49,316 --> 00:14:51,383
- You can call me "Dad."
- Really?

388
00:14:51,418 --> 00:14:54,152
No.

389
00:14:54,187 --> 00:14:55,670
So you know we're talking
about my father, right,

390
00:14:55,706 --> 00:14:57,255
who's no longer alive?

391
00:14:57,291 --> 00:14:59,591
- Yeah, I forgot that.
- You forgot that?

392
00:14:59,593 --> 00:15:02,310
The basis of your compliment
in the first place?

393
00:15:02,362 --> 00:15:05,196
You suck the fun
out of everything, don't you?

394
00:15:09,002 --> 00:15:10,719
You did this quickly.

395
00:15:13,073 --> 00:15:15,240
You gave me a job to do,
and I did it.

396
00:15:15,275 --> 00:15:16,775
And why did you leave it
on my desk

397
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:18,410
instead of bringing it
to me directly?

398
00:15:18,445 --> 00:15:20,245
I just wanted to give you
a chance to look it over.

399
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,513
And does that have something
to do with the fact

400
00:15:21,565 --> 00:15:23,264
that I asked you
to check it for exposure

401
00:15:23,317 --> 00:15:24,916
and not rewrite it?

402
00:15:24,951 --> 00:15:27,886
I know, I may have
overstepped my assignment.

403
00:15:27,921 --> 00:15:30,155
It's just Dr. Barnes
is the first black female

404
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:32,824
chief of surgery
at a major New York hospital.

405
00:15:32,876 --> 00:15:34,459
She faced discrimination
at every turn,

406
00:15:34,494 --> 00:15:35,894
and she still got the job done,

407
00:15:35,929 --> 00:15:39,898
so she doesn't need soaring
language to communicate that.

408
00:15:39,933 --> 00:15:41,499
I'll tell Dr. Barnes
you said that.

409
00:15:41,535 --> 00:15:43,635
So you're accepting my changes?

410
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:45,337
I'll present them to her
with my blessing.

411
00:15:45,372 --> 00:15:49,074
We'll see what she thinks.

412
00:15:49,126 --> 00:15:51,109
Jessica, um...

413
00:15:51,144 --> 00:15:54,946
if you ever have a case
with Dr. Barnes,

414
00:15:54,981 --> 00:15:56,548
I would love to be a part of it.

415
00:15:56,583 --> 00:15:57,615
I have a better idea.

416
00:15:57,651 --> 00:16:01,586
Why don't you come
to the speech with me?

417
00:16:07,461 --> 00:16:09,427
That is exactly why
we need to figure out a way

418
00:16:09,429 --> 00:16:11,613
to get you on the board
of directors of Comcast.

419
00:16:11,648 --> 00:16:13,732
From your lips to God's ears.

420
00:16:13,767 --> 00:16:15,467
Jack, I'm sorry.
Can I speak to you for a second?

421
00:16:15,502 --> 00:16:17,068
Uh, we're kind of
in the middle of something.

422
00:16:17,104 --> 00:16:18,536
It'll only take a minute.
It's firm business.

423
00:16:18,572 --> 00:16:20,472
I'm afraid it's not optional.

424
00:16:20,507 --> 00:16:22,073
I'm sorry to interrupt.

425
00:16:22,109 --> 00:16:24,743
Harvey Specter, by the way,
of Pearson Specter.

426
00:16:25,979 --> 00:16:28,446
This will only take a second.

427
00:16:28,482 --> 00:16:30,148
You think I don't know
what you're doing?

428
00:16:30,183 --> 00:16:32,050
You're trying to poach
my client.

429
00:16:32,052 --> 00:16:33,518
What makes you think
I'm trying to do that?

430
00:16:33,553 --> 00:16:35,754
Please, "Harvey Specter
of Pearson Specter."

431
00:16:35,789 --> 00:16:37,021
Let me tell you something,

432
00:16:37,057 --> 00:16:38,723
guy's been my client
for ten years.

433
00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:40,859
He's not leaving me
for the likes of you.

434
00:16:40,894 --> 00:16:42,193
Then I guess
our business here is done.

435
00:16:42,229 --> 00:16:43,628
What the hell is going on?

436
00:16:43,663 --> 00:16:45,163
Nothing's going on.
You're free.

437
00:16:45,198 --> 00:16:47,148
In fact, I'll walk you back.

438
00:16:48,201 --> 00:16:50,502
Oh, look at that.

439
00:16:50,537 --> 00:16:51,886
Is that Charles Barkley
taking a selfie

440
00:16:51,938 --> 00:16:53,978
with your loyal client
who happened to have grown up

441
00:16:54,007 --> 00:16:55,774
in Philadelphia
during the Barkley era?

442
00:16:55,809 --> 00:16:57,809
Look, you might not
give a shit about Charles,

443
00:16:57,844 --> 00:17:00,044
but he sure as hell does.

444
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,146
You son of a bitch.

445
00:17:01,181 --> 00:17:02,580
I'm sorry, Jack.
Could you repeat that?

446
00:17:02,616 --> 00:17:03,698
I couldn't hear you
over the sound

447
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:04,949
of me taking your client.

448
00:17:04,985 --> 00:17:07,185
Then let me say it louder.
This isn't over.

449
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:09,120
It better be, because you've got
four other clients

450
00:17:09,156 --> 00:17:11,623
from Chicago, Boston,
Los Angeles, and Houston.

451
00:17:11,658 --> 00:17:13,992
And you may not know
who those famous ballers are,

452
00:17:14,027 --> 00:17:15,977
but I do.

453
00:17:19,566 --> 00:17:22,867
Will, Jennifer, thank you for
seeing us on such short notice.

454
00:17:22,903 --> 00:17:25,286
Well, you did serve
our client with a lawsuit.

455
00:17:25,338 --> 00:17:27,605
Nevertheless,
we have an offer for you.

456
00:17:31,678 --> 00:17:34,379
You've gotta be kidding me.

457
00:17:34,414 --> 00:17:36,114
You called us all the way
down here for this?

458
00:17:36,149 --> 00:17:37,782
I wouldn't wipe my ass
with this.

459
00:17:37,834 --> 00:17:39,684
Well, Robert, we don't
look at it that way.

460
00:17:39,719 --> 00:17:42,554
How exactly
do you look at it, Will?

461
00:17:42,589 --> 00:17:44,823
We look at it as a gift
to a couple of vultures

462
00:17:44,858 --> 00:17:47,292
trying to pick the flesh
off the bones of an old case.

463
00:17:47,327 --> 00:17:48,526
That is what every lawyer

464
00:17:48,562 --> 00:17:50,462
who has had something to hide
has ever said.

465
00:17:50,497 --> 00:17:52,030
And it doesn't change the fact

466
00:17:52,065 --> 00:17:54,032
that your client
killed 200 people.

467
00:17:54,067 --> 00:17:56,167
Then we're gonna tell you
what we told the last attorney.

468
00:17:56,203 --> 00:17:57,819
You go to trial,
you'll be buried in paperwork

469
00:17:57,854 --> 00:17:59,170
for the next ten years.

470
00:17:59,206 --> 00:18:00,805
Well, if this were yesterday,

471
00:18:00,841 --> 00:18:02,474
then we might be rattled
by that.

472
00:18:02,509 --> 00:18:05,610
But since then, new information
has come to light.

473
00:18:05,662 --> 00:18:07,629
And what new information
is that?

474
00:18:07,664 --> 00:18:09,481
This is a list of everyone
who works at my firm.

475
00:18:09,516 --> 00:18:13,151
And this is a list
of everyone that works at mine.

476
00:18:13,186 --> 00:18:15,453
You see, we're not
some solo practitioner

477
00:18:15,489 --> 00:18:17,889
with a part-time paralegal
working out of a mall.

478
00:18:17,924 --> 00:18:22,460
What my associate is getting at
is we're two huge law firms,

479
00:18:22,496 --> 00:18:25,363
perfectly designed
to kick your ass.

480
00:18:25,398 --> 00:18:27,131
I don't care how many people
work at your firms.

481
00:18:27,133 --> 00:18:29,033
Someone needs
to pay their salaries.

482
00:18:29,069 --> 00:18:30,635
And if you're working on this,

483
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:32,036
you're not doing that.

484
00:18:32,072 --> 00:18:33,371
Then doesn't it come in handy

485
00:18:33,406 --> 00:18:36,841
to have a $20-billion hedge fund
footing the bill?

486
00:18:39,012 --> 00:18:41,312
So you can either add
a bunch of zeroes

487
00:18:41,348 --> 00:18:44,098
to this bullshit offer,
or we'll see you in court.

488
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:56,381
Mind if I ask you a question?

489
00:18:56,417 --> 00:18:57,682
If it's about
using my connections

490
00:18:57,718 --> 00:18:59,651
to get Stevie Wonder
to play at your wedding,

491
00:18:59,703 --> 00:19:03,188
I already tried.

492
00:19:03,223 --> 00:19:05,824
Why didn't you tell me
about the hedge fund?

493
00:19:05,859 --> 00:19:07,025
Well, what difference
does it make

494
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:08,160
where we get our money from?

495
00:19:08,162 --> 00:19:09,327
It doesn't make a difference,

496
00:19:09,363 --> 00:19:11,663
except for the fact
you didn't tell me.

497
00:19:11,698 --> 00:19:13,965
What are you getting
so bent out of shape for?

498
00:19:14,001 --> 00:19:15,467
We landed a punch back there.

499
00:19:15,502 --> 00:19:17,068
We landed a punch or you did?

500
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:18,587
What's that supposed to mean?

501
00:19:18,622 --> 00:19:21,022
First you call me "associate"
in front of opposing counsel,

502
00:19:21,058 --> 00:19:22,674
and now I find out
you're keeping things from me.

503
00:19:22,709 --> 00:19:23,725
Look...

504
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,510
I'm just saying,
are we a team or not?

505
00:19:25,546 --> 00:19:27,679
I called you
what I called you in there

506
00:19:27,714 --> 00:19:29,414
because they want to see
someone in charge.

507
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:33,151
And looking at the two of us,
they're gonna think it's me.

508
00:19:33,187 --> 00:19:35,220
And I didn't think
about telling you about Arcadian

509
00:19:35,255 --> 00:19:38,323
because I came up with that
when you weren't there.

510
00:19:39,643 --> 00:19:41,693
For the record,
I had the same idea.

511
00:19:41,728 --> 00:19:43,929
I went to a hedge fund
before I even came to you.

512
00:19:43,964 --> 00:19:44,996
Well, congratulations.

513
00:19:45,032 --> 00:19:46,698
If you had closed them
like I closed my guys,

514
00:19:46,733 --> 00:19:48,533
I wouldn't be standing here
explaining myself.

515
00:19:48,535 --> 00:19:51,319
So let's talk when we hear back
from these clowns.

516
00:19:51,371 --> 00:19:54,306
And put a smile on your face.

00:26:37,547 --> 00:26:39,497
Uh, Robert, that's a bad idea.

693
00:26:39,549 --> 00:26:40,748
What are you talking about?

694
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:43,668
They throw a jab,
we answer with a right cross.

695
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45,303
Yes, if we go to trial now,
we get a decision,

696
00:26:45,338 --> 00:26:46,921
but if we go in three months,
we get a knockout.

697
00:26:46,923 --> 00:26:48,256
What the hell
are you talking about?

698
00:26:48,258 --> 00:26:49,474
There's a bill
on the governor's desk

699
00:26:49,509 --> 00:26:51,059
waiting to be passed.

700
00:26:51,094 --> 00:26:52,760
It lifts the cap
on punitive damages.

701
00:26:52,762 --> 00:26:54,729
There's a reason
he hasn't signed it yet.

702
00:26:54,764 --> 00:26:56,597
The AMA is up his ass.

703
00:26:56,649 --> 00:26:58,232
We go now.

704
00:26:58,268 --> 00:27:01,302
The CEO of Kelton Insurance's
contract is up.

705
00:27:01,337 --> 00:27:03,020
He doesn't want
to be renegotiating

706
00:27:03,073 --> 00:27:04,572
while he's on the front page
of the<i> Journal</i>

707
00:27:04,607 --> 00:27:05,847
being accused of killing people.

708
00:27:05,859 --> 00:27:07,241
That threat takes these people

709
00:27:07,277 --> 00:27:09,610
from $1,000 per person
to $5,000,

710
00:27:09,612 --> 00:27:11,028
but if we actually
go to trial...

711
00:27:11,081 --> 00:27:14,415
If we go to trial,
we may get nothing.

712
00:27:14,451 --> 00:27:17,668
And I'm finished having
this conversation.

713
00:27:17,704 --> 00:27:19,787
So now I see where we stand.
We're not partners.

714
00:27:19,789 --> 00:27:20,789
I'm just the associate.

715
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:22,090
You're the one
calling the shots.

716
00:27:22,125 --> 00:27:23,205
I thought I made that clear

717
00:27:23,209 --> 00:27:24,375
from the second
we started this thing.

718
00:27:24,427 --> 00:27:26,961
Now answer this motion,
get my motion done,

719
00:27:26,963 --> 00:27:28,296
and be in court
tomorrow morning,

720
00:27:28,298 --> 00:27:30,498
because this is gonna happen
whether you like it or not.

721
00:27:36,356 --> 00:27:37,972
Oh... what the hell?

722
00:27:38,024 --> 00:27:39,024
What the hell what?

723
00:27:39,058 --> 00:27:40,441
You spilled my coffee.

724
00:27:40,477 --> 00:27:41,859
You ran into me.

725
00:27:41,895 --> 00:27:43,528
I don't care who ran into who.

726
00:27:43,563 --> 00:27:45,897
This is my office.
How about a little "excuse me"?

727
00:27:45,949 --> 00:27:48,116
Oh, okay, Harvey.
Excuse me.

728
00:27:48,151 --> 00:27:50,067
Feel free to send me
the bill for dry cleaning.

729
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:52,703
I'm paying
for everything else around here.

730
00:28:01,164 --> 00:28:03,164
Donna, now is not a good time.

731
00:28:03,166 --> 00:28:04,582
I don't care.

732
00:28:04,634 --> 00:28:07,034
I'm not a prize to be used
to get revenge on Louis.

733
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:08,202
What the hell
are you talking about?

734
00:28:08,238 --> 00:28:09,570
Are you gonna deny you told him

735
00:28:09,606 --> 00:28:10,705
that you were gonna
take me back?

736
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:12,507
That is not what I said.

737
00:28:12,509 --> 00:28:13,891
No, do not lawyer me,

738
00:28:13,927 --> 00:28:15,426
because it may not be
exactly what you said,

739
00:28:15,478 --> 00:28:17,478
but don't try to tell me
it wasn't what you meant.

740
00:28:17,514 --> 00:28:18,563
Donna...

741
00:28:18,598 --> 00:28:19,680
And another thing,
what makes you think

742
00:28:19,732 --> 00:28:21,649
if I were ever to leave Louis

743
00:28:21,684 --> 00:28:25,102
that I would ever,
ever come back to you?

744
00:28:34,197 --> 00:28:36,030
Mr. Specter,
I know this is a bad time,

745
00:28:36,032 --> 00:28:37,665
but I have to remind you that...

746
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:40,434
I know!
Jessica wants to see me.

747
00:28:49,612 --> 00:28:51,562
Donna, hey, can I talk
to you for a second?

748
00:28:51,598 --> 00:28:53,314
It's actually not a good time
right this second.

749
00:28:53,349 --> 00:28:55,116
- It's important.
- [sighs]

750
00:28:55,151 --> 00:28:56,184
I just need to know if Harvey

751
00:28:56,219 --> 00:28:57,619
is still tight
with Judge Hernandez.

752
00:28:57,637 --> 00:28:58,786
Why?

753
00:28:58,822 --> 00:29:00,188
I need her to postpone
a hearing for me.

754
00:29:00,223 --> 00:29:01,155
You know what, Mike?

755
00:29:01,191 --> 00:29:02,323
If you want something
from Harvey,

756
00:29:02,358 --> 00:29:04,525
you're gonna have
to ask him yourself.

757
00:29:04,561 --> 00:29:06,327
(Harvey)
You wanted to see me?

758
00:29:06,362 --> 00:29:07,945
That was 12 hours ago.

759
00:29:07,997 --> 00:29:10,331
I was putting
some things in order.

760
00:29:10,383 --> 00:29:11,866
What things in order,

761
00:29:11,901 --> 00:29:13,718
stealing more
of Jack Soloff's clients?

762
00:29:13,770 --> 00:29:15,269
As a matter of fact, yes.

763
00:29:15,271 --> 00:29:16,437
God damn it, Harvey.

764
00:29:16,472 --> 00:29:18,306
Jessica, I went in there.
I tried to make peace.

765
00:29:18,341 --> 00:29:20,408
He spat in my face.

766
00:29:20,443 --> 00:29:21,943
I tried again.
He did it again.

767
00:29:21,978 --> 00:29:23,277
And I said,
"Enough is enough."

768
00:29:23,329 --> 00:29:25,213
Then you walk out the door.
You don't steal his clients.

769
00:29:25,265 --> 00:29:27,198
You know what?
This doesn't concern you.

770
00:29:27,233 --> 00:29:28,616
This is between me and Jack.

771
00:29:28,651 --> 00:29:30,585
Oh, it was between you and Jack
until he came to me,

772
00:29:30,637 --> 00:29:32,653
and I had to cover for you.

773
00:29:32,689 --> 00:29:34,021
You covered for me?

774
00:29:34,023 --> 00:29:35,223
Goddamn right I did.

775
00:29:35,258 --> 00:29:37,258
I told him sending you
after him was my idea

776
00:29:37,293 --> 00:29:38,293
in the first place.

777
00:29:38,294 --> 00:29:39,293
That's not covering for me.

778
00:29:39,329 --> 00:29:40,761
That's covering for you,

779
00:29:40,797 --> 00:29:42,930
because that should have been
your idea in the first place,

780
00:29:42,966 --> 00:29:45,132
instead of welcoming
every competitor we have

781
00:29:45,168 --> 00:29:47,068
into our offices behind my back.

782
00:29:47,103 --> 00:29:48,336
What the hell
are you talking about?

783
00:29:48,371 --> 00:29:49,904
I'm talking about Robert Zane

784
00:29:49,939 --> 00:29:52,840
and you bringing him in here
without consulting me.

785
00:29:52,876 --> 00:29:54,075
I didn't bring in shit.

786
00:29:54,110 --> 00:29:56,310
Mike Ross brought Zane in
without asking,

787
00:29:56,346 --> 00:29:58,312
and I had to pretend to be
on board with that too.

788
00:29:58,348 --> 00:30:00,898
And now you're hoping this leads
to what you always wanted.

789
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:02,550
This thing's over, Zane goes,

790
00:30:02,585 --> 00:30:04,118
and Mike heads
out the door with him.

791
00:30:04,153 --> 00:30:05,269
That's enough.

792
00:30:05,321 --> 00:30:07,455
You need to get yourself
under control right now.

793
00:30:07,490 --> 00:30:08,773
What the hell
are you talking about?

794
00:30:08,808 --> 00:30:10,408
I'm talking about
you have a problem,

795
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:12,260
and it doesn't have
anything to do with me.

796
00:30:12,295 --> 00:30:13,661
And you just expose it
by bringing up

797
00:30:13,696 --> 00:30:15,830
some paranoid bullshit
about Mike Ross

798
00:30:15,882 --> 00:30:17,431
going with Robert Zane.

799
00:30:17,467 --> 00:30:20,201
Because this all started
when Donna left you,

800
00:30:20,236 --> 00:30:21,369
and now you're afraid

801
00:30:21,404 --> 00:30:23,104
that Mike's going to do
the same thing.

802
00:30:23,139 --> 00:30:24,372
So you better get

803
00:30:24,424 --> 00:30:26,173
your abandonment issues
under control,

804
00:30:26,175 --> 00:30:28,359
because Jack Soloff
is gonna keep coming,

805
00:30:28,394 --> 00:30:30,745
and now you're gonna
have to put him down.

806
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:33,381
[heartbeat thumping]

807
00:30:38,221 --> 00:30:41,522
[indistinct voices]

808
00:30:52,902 --> 00:30:54,268
[slow motion]
Mr. Specter,

809
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:58,706
Mike Ross is waiting for you
in your office.

810
00:30:58,741 --> 00:31:00,107
Hey, I need to talk to you.

811
00:31:00,143 --> 00:31:01,642
Not now.

812
00:31:01,694 --> 00:31:03,654
I know you're mad from before,
but I need a favor.

813
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,346
I said not now.

814
00:31:05,381 --> 00:31:06,664
Harvey, what's going on
with you?

815
00:31:06,716 --> 00:31:09,500
Nothing's wrong.
I need a glass of water.

816
00:31:09,552 --> 00:31:11,519
What the hell is going on?

817
00:31:11,571 --> 00:31:14,505
[heartbeat thumping]

818
00:31:19,562 --> 00:31:21,996
Okay, I'm dialing 911.

819
00:31:22,031 --> 00:31:23,264
No, you're not.

820
00:31:23,299 --> 00:31:24,732
Yes, I am. You could be
having a heart attack.

821
00:31:24,767 --> 00:31:28,736
- It's not a heart attack.
- You don't know that.

822
00:31:28,738 --> 00:31:30,371
It's a panic attack.

823
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:36,010
Oh, hate to interrupt
a special moment,

824
00:31:36,045 --> 00:31:40,047
but I thought you might wanna
take a gander at this.

825
00:31:40,083 --> 00:31:41,949
What the hell is that?

826
00:31:41,985 --> 00:31:44,418
If you recall, our last proposal

827
00:31:44,454 --> 00:31:46,387
reduced contingent compensation.

828
00:31:46,422 --> 00:31:49,156
This one wipes it out
altogether.

829
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:53,060
What's the matter?
No snappy comeback?

830
00:31:53,096 --> 00:31:54,795
I've read the bylaws.
You can't do that.

831
00:31:54,831 --> 00:31:56,330
You doing his fighting
for him now?

832
00:31:56,366 --> 00:31:57,646
I don't care
what the bylaws say.

833
00:31:57,667 --> 00:31:59,400
I have Louis's backing.

834
00:31:59,452 --> 00:32:01,569
So either you
give back my client,

835
00:32:01,604 --> 00:32:03,604
or good luck
billing 2,500 hours a year

836
00:32:03,639 --> 00:32:05,556
like the rest of us.

837
00:32:06,943 --> 00:32:09,777
You go right ahead
and put your proposal to a vote.

838
00:32:09,812 --> 00:32:11,746
But by the time
this thing passes,

839
00:32:11,781 --> 00:32:13,347
I'll have
your other four clients.

840
00:32:13,383 --> 00:32:15,166
Bullshit, you couldn't have
gotten to them already.

841
00:32:15,201 --> 00:32:18,102
Go goddamn check.
They're already in play.

842
00:32:18,137 --> 00:32:19,954
You pass this thing,

843
00:32:19,989 --> 00:32:21,555
you won't be billing
anything at all.

844
00:32:21,591 --> 00:32:22,957
You're not gonna
get away with that.

845
00:32:22,959 --> 00:32:24,825
Wrong.
I didn't start this.

846
00:32:24,861 --> 00:32:26,160
But I'm gonna finish it.

847
00:32:26,212 --> 00:32:28,729
And when you said I only ever
looked at you as competition,

848
00:32:28,765 --> 00:32:29,964
you were wrong.

849
00:32:29,999 --> 00:32:32,266
I never looked at you
as anything at all.

850
00:32:44,514 --> 00:32:47,448
Are you all right?

851
00:32:47,483 --> 00:32:49,784
No.

852
00:33:03,583 --> 00:33:06,100
Is it true what you just said
about his clients?

853
00:33:06,135 --> 00:33:08,202
No, which is why I need you

854
00:33:08,204 --> 00:33:09,370
to do anything you have to do

855
00:33:09,372 --> 00:33:13,707
to convince him
this is happening.

856
00:33:13,709 --> 00:33:15,543
I'll get it done.

857
00:33:24,413 --> 00:33:26,914
[knocking]

858
00:33:28,650 --> 00:33:30,166
What are you doing here?

859
00:33:30,218 --> 00:33:31,634
This is my home.

860
00:33:31,669 --> 00:33:32,669
It's also your office.

861
00:33:32,670 --> 00:33:34,754
And that entrance
is right around there.

862
00:33:34,756 --> 00:33:36,556
Now if you'll excuse me,
I'm in the middle of my dinner.

863
00:33:36,591 --> 00:33:39,092
I called to set an appointment.
You didn't call back.

864
00:33:39,094 --> 00:33:40,226
Because I had patients.

865
00:33:40,261 --> 00:33:41,427
And what the hell am I?

866
00:33:41,429 --> 00:33:43,896
You're an ex-patient
I haven't seen in weeks,

867
00:33:43,932 --> 00:33:46,015
who ignored me when I said
that your panic attacks

868
00:33:46,067 --> 00:33:47,734
wouldn't stop
until you accepted the fact

869
00:33:47,769 --> 00:33:49,569
that your secretary
wasn't coming back.

870
00:33:49,604 --> 00:33:51,687
I did accept it,
and I had another one anyway.

871
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:53,272
That's why I'm here.

872
00:33:53,324 --> 00:33:55,408
You mean you're here
to get more pills.

873
00:33:55,443 --> 00:33:56,826
Yes, I am.

874
00:33:56,861 --> 00:33:58,244
And what happened
to the ones I gave you?

875
00:33:58,279 --> 00:33:59,279
I threw them out.

876
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:00,446
Bullshit, you didn't
throw them out.

877
00:34:00,498 --> 00:34:01,864
You ran out.

878
00:34:01,916 --> 00:34:03,199
No, I didn't run out.
I'm telling you the truth.

879
00:34:03,251 --> 00:34:04,333
Okay, well, it doesn't matter,

880
00:34:04,369 --> 00:34:06,085
because I'm a psychiatrist,
not a pharmacy,

881
00:34:06,121 --> 00:34:07,787
and if you want my help,
you do it my way.

882
00:34:07,789 --> 00:34:09,255
You make regular appointments,

883
00:34:09,290 --> 00:34:11,124
and you commit
to doing the work.

884
00:34:11,126 --> 00:34:12,842
And you show up at my house
unannounced again,

885
00:34:12,877 --> 00:34:15,378
I'm calling the police.

886
00:34:15,430 --> 00:34:17,847
Do you have any time available
ten minutes from now?

887
00:34:20,685 --> 00:34:22,802
I want to give you time
to finish your dinner.

888
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:28,858
[upbeat music]

889
00:34:28,893 --> 00:34:30,143
Is the car ready?

890
00:34:30,145 --> 00:34:33,863
It's downstairs
warming up, like you.

891
00:34:33,898 --> 00:34:35,314
What do you mean?

892
00:34:35,316 --> 00:34:37,233
Well, I received the invitation

893
00:34:37,285 --> 00:34:39,152
and couldn't help but notice

894
00:34:39,204 --> 00:34:41,871
that Dr. Barnes
is in the program,

895
00:34:41,906 --> 00:34:44,407
and you're in the program too.

896
00:34:44,459 --> 00:34:46,876
Look at that, I am.

897
00:34:46,911 --> 00:34:49,162
Why didn't you tell me
it was your speech?

898
00:34:49,164 --> 00:34:50,296
I wanted your honest opinion.

899
00:34:50,331 --> 00:34:51,297
But you didn't ask
for my opinion.

900
00:34:51,332 --> 00:34:52,965
You asked me to check it
for exposure.

901
00:34:53,001 --> 00:34:54,634
If there's one thing
I've noticed about you,

902
00:34:54,669 --> 00:34:56,335
it's that you give your opinion

903
00:34:56,371 --> 00:34:58,471
whether it's asked for or not.

904
00:35:00,175 --> 00:35:02,909
And why does my opinion
matter to you so much

905
00:35:02,944 --> 00:35:04,343
that you would
go through all this?

906
00:35:04,379 --> 00:35:07,046
Your opinion
doesn't matter to me.

907
00:35:07,098 --> 00:35:09,115
Your development does.

908
00:35:11,953 --> 00:35:13,219
What are you saying?

909
00:35:13,254 --> 00:35:18,257
Oh, you're gonna make me
say it out loud?

910
00:35:18,293 --> 00:35:19,659
You remind me of me.

911
00:35:19,694 --> 00:35:23,029
And what do I have to do
to get to be like you?

912
00:35:23,064 --> 00:35:24,664
Well, you should know.

913
00:35:24,699 --> 00:35:26,399
You read my damn speech.

914
00:35:27,569 --> 00:35:28,901
You mean I rewrote
your damn speech.

915
00:35:28,937 --> 00:35:30,870
Oh, shit, I said it.

916
00:35:30,905 --> 00:35:32,338
I'm going to show you mercy,

917
00:35:32,373 --> 00:35:34,507
considering your dress choice.

918
00:35:34,542 --> 00:35:35,641
What's wrong with my dress?

919
00:35:35,693 --> 00:35:36,693
Oh, you don't know.

920
00:35:36,744 --> 00:35:38,511
Come on, this is really special.

921
00:35:38,546 --> 00:35:39,546
[Jessica laughs]

922
00:35:41,115 --> 00:35:43,216
You wanna know the truth?

923
00:35:43,251 --> 00:35:45,484
I think you bottled up
your anger at Donna,

924
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,019
let it out at Louis,

925
00:35:47,055 --> 00:35:47,987
and then when
it came back at you,

926
00:35:48,022 --> 00:35:48,955
you pushed it down again.

927
00:35:48,990 --> 00:35:49,922
That's bullshit.

928
00:35:49,958 --> 00:35:51,591
The clinical term
is displacement,

929
00:35:51,626 --> 00:35:53,893
and the cure for it is letting
your anger at Donna out.

930
00:35:53,928 --> 00:35:55,061
Well, I'm not gonna do that,

931
00:35:55,096 --> 00:35:57,063
because even if I would,
Donna's not here.

932
00:35:57,098 --> 00:35:59,031
No, I didn't say you had
to let it out at Donna.

933
00:35:59,067 --> 00:36:00,233
You can let it out at me.

934
00:36:00,268 --> 00:36:01,734
- That's stupid.
- No, it isn't.

935
00:36:01,769 --> 00:36:03,769
If she were here right now,

936
00:36:03,805 --> 00:36:05,538
what's the first thing
that comes to your mind?

937
00:36:05,573 --> 00:36:06,973
Hey, Donna,
what are you doing here?

938
00:36:07,008 --> 00:36:09,208
What if I said,
"I'm here for you"?

939
00:36:09,244 --> 00:36:10,543
I'd say, "Shouldn't you be
at Louis's desk?"

940
00:36:10,578 --> 00:36:13,646
And what if I were?
How would that make you feel?

941
00:36:13,681 --> 00:36:15,648
It would make me feel like
role play is stupid,

942
00:36:15,683 --> 00:36:16,749
because you're not Donna,

943
00:36:16,784 --> 00:36:18,184
and I don't give a shit
what your degree says.

944
00:36:18,219 --> 00:36:19,318
I'm not gonna
go through this again

945
00:36:19,354 --> 00:36:20,354
just to get more pills.

946
00:36:20,388 --> 00:36:21,687
Well, I may not be Donna,

947
00:36:21,723 --> 00:36:23,589
but I'm beginning to see
what it's like to be her.

948
00:36:23,625 --> 00:36:25,091
What the hell
are you talking about?

949
00:36:25,126 --> 00:36:26,542
I'm talking about I'm a woman

950
00:36:26,594 --> 00:36:28,694
who you've been bullying
to get what you want.

951
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:29,695
Bullying?
I'm paying you.

952
00:36:29,697 --> 00:36:31,113
And that doesn't mean
that I exist

953
00:36:31,165 --> 00:36:32,531
to serve your needs.

954
00:36:32,567 --> 00:36:33,766
Well, it goddamn should.

955
00:36:33,801 --> 00:36:34,901
If you spoke to Donna that way,

956
00:36:34,936 --> 00:36:36,168
no wonder she left you.

957
00:36:36,204 --> 00:36:38,304
Because you don't just
pay people to be loyal.

958
00:36:38,339 --> 00:36:39,605
How dare you?

959
00:36:39,607 --> 00:36:41,374
I don't give a shit about
the money, and I never did.

960
00:36:41,409 --> 00:36:42,708
No, you didn't.

961
00:36:42,744 --> 00:36:44,377
It was just a way to get me
to do what you wanted.

962
00:36:44,412 --> 00:36:46,145
So when your life
was on the line

963
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:47,980
and I was there for you
every step of the way,

964
00:36:47,982 --> 00:36:48,982
it meant nothing?

965
00:36:48,983 --> 00:36:50,283
It wasn't every step of the way.

966
00:36:50,318 --> 00:36:52,585
You bailed out
the second I wanted more.

967
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:54,754
That's when you decided
to betray me.

968
00:36:54,789 --> 00:36:57,423
How the hell is moving on
and putting myself first

969
00:36:57,458 --> 00:36:58,491
betraying you?

970
00:36:58,526 --> 00:36:59,625
Because you went
to Louis to do it,

971
00:36:59,661 --> 00:37:00,793
and that's not moving on.

972
00:37:00,845 --> 00:37:02,395
That's sticking a knife
in my gut and twisting it.

973
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:04,163
Yeah, Harvey, it is.

974
00:37:04,198 --> 00:37:06,933
How does it feel to be
on the receiving end for once?

975
00:37:10,805 --> 00:37:13,773
Harvey, did you hear me?

976
00:37:13,808 --> 00:37:15,174
I said, how does it feel
to know that

977
00:37:15,209 --> 00:37:17,810
you've taken the first step
towards regaining control?

978
00:37:20,415 --> 00:37:23,182
When someone twists
a knife in your gut,

979
00:37:23,217 --> 00:37:25,952
I feel like I want
to twist one right back.

980
00:37:27,922 --> 00:37:29,772
Mr. Zane,
you scheduled this hearing.

981
00:37:29,807 --> 00:37:30,940
We've been waiting ten minutes.

982
00:37:30,975 --> 00:37:32,608
I'm not waiting any longer.

983
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:34,327
Uh, you don't have to,
your honor.

984
00:37:34,362 --> 00:37:36,245
My motion is here.

985
00:37:36,297 --> 00:37:39,548
It better get up here fast.

986
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,183
Where the hell were you?

987
00:37:41,219 --> 00:37:42,768
I'm standing up here
with my dick in my hand,

988
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:44,270
and you're out having a soda.

989
00:37:44,322 --> 00:37:45,571
I had something to do.

990
00:37:45,573 --> 00:37:46,806
Yeah, well, whatever it was,

991
00:37:46,841 --> 00:37:49,475
I hope it was worth
almost losing this case over.

992
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:50,860
Motion to expedite trial.

993
00:37:50,895 --> 00:37:53,346
I thought this was a hearing
on their motion to dismiss.

994
00:37:53,381 --> 00:37:55,147
Well, if you expedite our trial,

995
00:37:55,183 --> 00:37:57,316
that takes care
of their motion to dismiss.

996
00:37:57,318 --> 00:37:59,952
Your Honor, they just got
this case two days ago.

997
00:37:59,988 --> 00:38:02,655
They're using the timing of
our client's contract expiration

998
00:38:02,690 --> 00:38:04,123
to try to shake us down.

999
00:38:04,158 --> 00:38:06,058
I have to say, Mr. Zane,
I find it hard to believe

1000
00:38:06,094 --> 00:38:08,227
that in two days
you've found out enough

1001
00:38:08,262 --> 00:38:09,962
to know you need
an expedited trial,

1002
00:38:09,998 --> 00:38:12,231
let alone
care about these people at all.

1003
00:38:12,266 --> 00:38:13,733
Your Honor, four years ago,

1004
00:38:13,768 --> 00:38:15,501
a mail carrier named
Stanley Powell

1005
00:38:15,536 --> 00:38:17,303
felt tightness in his chest.

1006
00:38:17,338 --> 00:38:18,671
He thought it was nothing,

1007
00:38:18,706 --> 00:38:21,207
but his wife insisted
he go to the hospital.

1008
00:38:21,242 --> 00:38:22,341
When he got there,

1009
00:38:22,377 --> 00:38:24,226
doctors couldn't find
anything wrong,

1010
00:38:24,278 --> 00:38:28,481
but they wanted to keep him
for one extra day.

1011
00:38:28,516 --> 00:38:29,982
Now unfortunately,

1012
00:38:29,984 --> 00:38:32,151
Kelton Insurance refused to pay.

1013
00:38:32,186 --> 00:38:34,286
So Mr. Powell went home,
crawled into bed,

1014
00:38:34,322 --> 00:38:35,988
and one day later, he was dead.

1015
00:38:36,024 --> 00:38:37,464
In front of you,
you have a complaint

1016
00:38:37,492 --> 00:38:39,458
that's over 5,000 pages long,

1017
00:38:39,494 --> 00:38:42,344
which tells the stories
of another 189 victims.

1018
00:38:42,397 --> 00:38:44,497
Pick a page at random,
tell me the number,

1019
00:38:44,532 --> 00:38:48,234
and I will tell you exactly
what their client did to them.

1020
00:38:48,236 --> 00:38:50,069
Your Honor, are you
actually buying that?

1021
00:38:51,873 --> 00:38:55,741
Page 627, Mr....

1022
00:38:55,743 --> 00:38:56,792
Lawrence Green.

1023
00:38:56,828 --> 00:38:58,411
63-year-old grandfather,

1024
00:38:58,463 --> 00:39:01,080
admitted to St. Vincent with
complaints of lower back pain

1025
00:39:01,132 --> 00:39:03,132
and excessive weight loss.

1026
00:39:03,167 --> 00:39:07,753
He thought it was stress.
Turns out it was lymphoma.

1027
00:39:07,755 --> 00:39:09,672
Only they didn't find out
until it was too late

1028
00:39:09,724 --> 00:39:14,427
because their client
refused to pay for the MRI.

1029
00:39:14,479 --> 00:39:16,762
So please, rule against us
if you have to,

1030
00:39:16,764 --> 00:39:18,848
but don't tell me we don't care.

1031
00:39:20,017 --> 00:39:22,134
Motion for expedited trial
granted.

1032
00:39:22,170 --> 00:39:24,520
Jury selection starts Monday.
[bangs gavel]

1033
00:39:26,407 --> 00:39:28,524
For your information,
that's what I was doing.

1034
00:39:28,576 --> 00:39:30,025
And it only took
as long as it did

1035
00:39:30,078 --> 00:39:31,994
because I was also doing
something for the one person

1036
00:39:32,029 --> 00:39:34,280
who has the right to treat me
like his associate

1037
00:39:34,332 --> 00:39:36,615
but treats me
