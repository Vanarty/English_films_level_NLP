(HARVEY READING)

2
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:04,381
(ON PHONE) <i>Rachel,
it's Professor Dunbar.</i>

3
00:00:04,464 --> 00:00:06,841
I was wondering if you'd be
interested in helping me

4
00:00:06,925 --> 00:00:08,176
<i>with the Innocence Project.</i>

5
00:00:08,259 --> 00:00:10,428
You want me to help you get
an innocent man off death row?

6
00:00:10,512 --> 00:00:12,639
What do you want,
Harvey?
Help me protect Mike Ross.

7
00:00:12,722 --> 00:00:15,016
He's in there
with a guy I put away
and the guy is no joke.

8
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:16,184
What am I supposed to do?

9
00:00:16,267 --> 00:00:18,269
You're supposed to move
the guy to another prison.

10
00:00:18,353 --> 00:00:20,021
You want me one-on-one,
you got it.

11
00:00:20,105 --> 00:00:22,148
I'm gonna use this
and they're gonna hold you.

12
00:00:22,232 --> 00:00:23,483
No!
What's going on here?

13
00:00:24,901 --> 00:00:26,319
Why did you come back
with the guard?

14
00:00:26,403 --> 00:00:28,029
I didn't do it to
get you to forgive me.

15
00:00:28,113 --> 00:00:30,031
I never should have let him
in here in the first place.

16
00:00:30,115 --> 00:00:31,825
The time you served
while awaiting trial

17
00:00:31,908 --> 00:00:33,535
was never factored
into your sentence.

18
00:00:33,618 --> 00:00:35,537
You're eligible for parole
in six weeks.

19
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:37,622
You think I don't
know this is your
protector's idea

20
00:00:37,706 --> 00:00:38,790
to get me off your back?

21
00:00:38,873 --> 00:00:39,874
No, Frank.

22
00:00:39,958 --> 00:00:42,460
Harvey's idea
was for me to
tell these guys

23
00:00:42,544 --> 00:00:43,712
that you were an informant.

24
00:00:43,795 --> 00:00:45,547
I figured out a way
to get Mike out early.

25
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:46,673
What's the catch?

26
00:00:46,756 --> 00:00:47,882
He has to inform
on his roommate.

27
00:00:47,966 --> 00:00:49,384
Mike gets him to turn,
he's free.

28
00:00:49,467 --> 00:00:50,760
When do you need
an answer by?

29
00:00:50,844 --> 00:00:51,886
Yesterday.

30
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:53,304
And the answer
needs to be yes.

31
00:00:56,182 --> 00:00:57,225
JESSICA:
Harvey, wait a second.

32
00:00:57,308 --> 00:00:59,394
Where are you going?
Where do you think I'm going?

33
00:00:59,477 --> 00:01:00,478
I'm going to see Mike.

34
00:01:00,562 --> 00:01:01,563
And I know
what you're going to say,

35
00:01:01,646 --> 00:01:03,898
but Mike went to prison
so we wouldn't have to,

36
00:01:03,982 --> 00:01:06,234
and now he's in danger
from a guy I put away.

37
00:01:06,317 --> 00:01:08,111
So, you'll forgive me
if I don't stand around

38
00:01:08,194 --> 00:01:09,904
and wait for you
to drop the hammer.

39
00:01:09,988 --> 00:01:11,156
You think I like
the idea of him

40
00:01:11,239 --> 00:01:12,449
rotting in that place?

41
00:01:12,532 --> 00:01:14,033
But if you want
this thing to work,

42
00:01:14,117 --> 00:01:15,827
you can't go running up there
in the middle of the night.

43
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:18,121
You heard Cahill,
he needs an answer yesterday.

44
00:01:18,204 --> 00:01:20,123
What he needs is results.

45
00:01:20,206 --> 00:01:21,916
And if Mike's lawyer
pulls him out of his cell

46
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,042
in the middle of the night,

47
00:01:23,126 --> 00:01:25,128
then his roommate is going to
sense there's something wrong

48
00:01:25,211 --> 00:01:27,005
before this thing
even gets started.

49
00:01:28,214 --> 00:01:31,050
Fine. But I'm going up there
first thing in the morning,

50
00:01:31,134 --> 00:01:33,178
and nothing you say
is going to stop me.

51
00:01:41,561 --> 00:01:42,771
KEVIN: Can't sleep?

52
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:44,355
Not really.

53
00:01:44,522 --> 00:01:45,982
Well, as long
as you're up,

54
00:01:46,065 --> 00:01:47,317
you might want to think
about putting up

55
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,818
some pictures of your own.

56
00:01:49,027 --> 00:01:51,488
That way you won't
have to keep staring at mine.

57
00:01:56,034 --> 00:01:57,368
How old are they?

58
00:01:59,204 --> 00:02:03,166
Maddy is seven
and Nate just turned five.

59
00:02:04,709 --> 00:02:06,044
They look really sweet.

60
00:02:06,711 --> 00:02:07,879
Yeah, they're...

61
00:02:08,713 --> 00:02:09,839
They're great.

62
00:02:10,215 --> 00:02:11,466
How often
do you get to see them?

63
00:02:11,549 --> 00:02:12,550
I don't.

64
00:02:12,634 --> 00:02:13,635
What do you mean
you don't?

65
00:02:13,718 --> 00:02:16,221
Bad divorce or something?
Nah, nah. Nothing like that.

66
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:18,139
We've been married
for 10 years.

67
00:02:18,223 --> 00:02:19,724
I just... I just
don't let them come here.

68
00:02:19,808 --> 00:02:20,850
What? Why not?

69
00:02:20,934 --> 00:02:22,685
They shouldn't see
their father as a criminal.

70
00:02:22,769 --> 00:02:24,979
Kevin. Come on, man.
I know it's hard on them.

71
00:02:25,063 --> 00:02:26,940
It tears me up every
single day that I'm here.

72
00:02:27,023 --> 00:02:29,526
But they're kids.
They're resilient.

73
00:02:30,527 --> 00:02:31,903
Yeah, I wouldn't be so sure.

74
00:02:31,986 --> 00:02:33,238
Well, Mike,
you don't have kids.

75
00:02:33,321 --> 00:02:34,531
So, you don't know.

76
00:02:34,614 --> 00:02:35,698
No, I don't.

77
00:02:35,782 --> 00:02:38,493
But I do know what it's like
to be a kid missing his dad.

78
00:02:38,576 --> 00:02:40,578
Please don't tell me your
old man abandoned the family.

79
00:02:41,746 --> 00:02:45,917
Both my parents died
in a car accident
when I was 11.

80
00:02:46,626 --> 00:02:48,253
Hit by a drunk driver.

81
00:02:48,753 --> 00:02:50,171
Jesus. That's...

82
00:02:50,505 --> 00:02:51,756
I'm sorry, Mike.

83
00:02:53,591 --> 00:02:55,426
Well, it was a long time ago.

84
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:58,179
Kevin, I understand
the instinct

85
00:02:58,263 --> 00:02:59,264
to protect your children,

86
00:02:59,347 --> 00:03:01,349
but what are you
protecting them from?

87
00:03:01,432 --> 00:03:02,475
What do you mean?

88
00:03:02,559 --> 00:03:04,269
I mean, we've been roommates
for a while now.

89
00:03:04,352 --> 00:03:05,436
Don't you think it's time
you told me

90
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,813
what you're in here for?

91
00:03:07,647 --> 00:03:08,648
(DOOR BUZZING)

92
00:03:09,065 --> 00:03:10,149
GUARD: Hey, Ross.

93
00:03:10,441 --> 00:03:11,860
Your lawyer's here.
Now?

94
00:03:11,943 --> 00:03:12,986
I'm just the messenger.

95
00:03:13,069 --> 00:03:14,279
You want out
of this box or not?

96
00:03:35,633 --> 00:03:37,427
Mr. Bailey,
my name is Rachel Zane.

97
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:39,053
<i>I am a law student
at Columbia,</i>

98
00:03:39,137 --> 00:03:40,889
<i>and I'm here to talk to you
about your case.</i>

99
00:03:40,972 --> 00:03:42,015
<i>Student?</i>
Yes.

100
00:03:42,098 --> 00:03:43,808
We work alongside
the Innocence Project

101
00:03:43,892 --> 00:03:46,060
<i>to determine if you have
the criteria for an appeal.</i>

102
00:03:46,269 --> 00:03:48,897
<i>Do you know how long
I been sitting on death row?</i>

103
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:50,732
Twelve years.
I read your file.

104
00:03:51,107 --> 00:03:53,401
And for the last 10 of them
I've been writing letters

105
00:03:53,484 --> 00:03:56,821
<i>and begging any lawyer
to listen to my story.</i>

106
00:03:57,238 --> 00:03:59,991
And they finally get around
to getting back to me,

107
00:04:00,491 --> 00:04:02,452
<i>and they don't
even have the courtesy</i>

108
00:04:02,535 --> 00:04:04,245
<i>of sending me a real lawyer?</i>

109
00:04:04,329 --> 00:04:07,498
<i>Mr. Bailey, trust me,
I will fight for you.</i>

110
00:04:07,665 --> 00:04:08,833
You're a student.

111
00:04:09,834 --> 00:04:11,461
<i>You can't do shit for me.</i>

112
00:04:13,171 --> 00:04:14,213
<i>Well, you know what?</i>

113
00:04:14,297 --> 00:04:16,591
You killed two people
in cold blood.

114
00:04:18,051 --> 00:04:19,302
<i>You know it and I know it,</i>

115
00:04:19,385 --> 00:04:20,511
<i>and that's why
you're in there.</i>

116
00:04:20,595 --> 00:04:22,221
<i>So, thank you
for making the decision</i>

117
00:04:22,305 --> 00:04:24,974
<i>to not take your case
an easy one.</i>

118
00:04:25,391 --> 00:04:26,643
You don't know me.

119
00:04:26,726 --> 00:04:28,102
<i>All you know
is what you've read</i>

120
00:04:28,186 --> 00:04:29,896
<i>in some damn file.</i>

121
00:04:30,688 --> 00:04:32,231
<i>I didn't kill anyone.</i>

122
00:04:32,815 --> 00:04:34,567
<i>I've been saying it
for 12 years</i>

123
00:04:34,651 --> 00:04:35,777
<i>and I can prove it.</i>

124
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:37,737
You're right.
I don't know you.

125
00:04:37,862 --> 00:04:39,447
<i>And you don't
know me either.</i>

126
00:04:40,448 --> 00:04:41,532
<i>So, do you want
to take a chance</i>

127
00:04:41,616 --> 00:04:42,992
<i>on each other or not?</i>

128
00:04:44,702 --> 00:04:46,037
<i>I need help...</i>

129
00:04:47,872 --> 00:04:49,040
<i>Ms. Zane.</i>

130
00:04:51,209 --> 00:04:52,794
<i>So, let me help you.</i>

131
00:04:57,924 --> 00:04:59,008
Harvey, what are you
doing here?

132
00:04:59,092 --> 00:05:00,635
There's something
I need to talk to you about.

133
00:05:00,718 --> 00:05:01,761
Sit down.

134
00:05:01,844 --> 00:05:02,887
What is it?

135
00:05:04,764 --> 00:05:06,557
I just got a visit
from Sean Cahill.

136
00:05:06,641 --> 00:05:07,684
About Gallo?

137
00:05:07,767 --> 00:05:09,227
I thought you said
he can't get him transferred.

138
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:10,645
He can't. But it turns out

139
00:05:10,728 --> 00:05:12,063
there's a way
he can get you out.

140
00:05:12,146 --> 00:05:13,147
What do you mean "out"?

141
00:05:13,231 --> 00:05:16,317
I mean out, as in
you walk out that front door

142
00:05:16,401 --> 00:05:17,485
and you never look back.

143
00:05:18,945 --> 00:05:20,113
What's the catch?
Mike.

144
00:05:20,196 --> 00:05:21,322
Harvey, you're not here
telling me

145
00:05:21,406 --> 00:05:22,991
that I can get out
with that look on your face

146
00:05:23,074 --> 00:05:24,117
if there isn't
something else.

147
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,785
He needs you to inform
on your cellmate.

148
00:05:25,868 --> 00:05:26,828
What?

149
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:28,413
If whatever you get
leads to a conviction

150
00:05:28,496 --> 00:05:29,497
of his father-in-law,

151
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,833
he'll commute your sentence
and you get to walk.

152
00:05:33,584 --> 00:05:34,585
What did the guy do?

153
00:05:34,669 --> 00:05:36,170
Who cares what he did?
I care.

154
00:05:36,254 --> 00:05:37,296
Because if it was so bad,

155
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:38,548
why didn't Kevin turn on him
in the first place?

156
00:05:38,631 --> 00:05:40,800
Mike, what does it matter?
He can get you out.

157
00:05:40,883 --> 00:05:42,427
This is my
only friend in here.

158
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:43,886
I'm not going to betray him.
Friend?

159
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:45,096
Listen to me, God damn it.

160
00:05:45,179 --> 00:05:46,723
There's someone in here
trying to kill you

161
00:05:46,806 --> 00:05:48,016
and I'm giving you a way out.

162
00:05:48,099 --> 00:05:49,183
I'm taking care of Gallo.

163
00:05:49,267 --> 00:05:50,351
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

164
00:05:50,435 --> 00:05:51,894
It means that I did
what you told me to do.

165
00:05:51,978 --> 00:05:53,730
I threatened to tell people
that he was an informant.

166
00:05:53,813 --> 00:05:55,189
But what I also did
was find out

167
00:05:55,273 --> 00:05:56,232
a way to get him parole.

168
00:05:56,315 --> 00:05:57,984
Parole? Are you crazy?

169
00:05:58,067 --> 00:05:59,360
He's not going
to get parole.

170
00:05:59,444 --> 00:06:00,570
Who's going
to say he deserves it?

171
00:06:00,653 --> 00:06:02,196
You know what, Harvey?
Instead of coming in here

172
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,531
and telling me
to betray my cellmate

173
00:06:03,614 --> 00:06:04,824
because Gallo
will never get parole,

174
00:06:04,907 --> 00:06:06,284
maybe you should
be helping me
get it for him.

175
00:06:06,367 --> 00:06:08,703
I'm never helping that
piece of shit do anything.

176
00:06:08,786 --> 00:06:10,455
And this isn't about Gallo,
and you know it.

177
00:06:10,538 --> 00:06:12,457
No, it's about you telling me
to turn on the one guy

178
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:14,709
in here that I trust based
on some plan that Cahill

179
00:06:14,792 --> 00:06:16,335
has that we don't even
know will work.

180
00:06:16,419 --> 00:06:17,462
No, Mike.

181
00:06:17,545 --> 00:06:19,464
It's about giving you
a chance to get your life back

182
00:06:19,547 --> 00:06:21,174
while it still
looks the same.

183
00:06:22,216 --> 00:06:24,218
Now, are you going
to take it or not?

184
00:06:26,804 --> 00:06:30,016

What the...
Hey, douche stick.

197
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:18,731
Are you responsible
for my mugs being here?

198
00:07:19,816 --> 00:07:21,609
I didn't.
I don't.

199
00:07:21,818 --> 00:07:23,736
(STUTTERS) We didn't have
anything else to use.

200
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:24,779
I don't give a shit.

201
00:07:24,862 --> 00:07:26,280
Take those things and
put them back where you...

202
00:07:26,364 --> 00:07:27,448
Well, if isn't Louis Shit.

203
00:07:27,532 --> 00:07:28,616
What's happening, boss?

204
00:07:28,699 --> 00:07:30,034
You bastard.
You took my mugs

205
00:07:30,118 --> 00:07:31,869
and you didn't even have
the balls to do it yourself.

206
00:07:31,953 --> 00:07:33,329
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

207
00:07:33,412 --> 00:07:34,747
But if something
of yours is in here,

208
00:07:34,831 --> 00:07:35,957
it had nothing
to do with me.

209
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:38,042
Really? Why don't you ask
the stuttering ass clown?

210
00:07:39,335 --> 00:07:41,212
We needed them for our

211
00:07:42,046 --> 00:07:43,464
(WHISPERING) urine tests.

212
00:07:43,548 --> 00:07:44,799
What did you say?
You peed on my catch phrase?

213
00:07:44,882 --> 00:07:45,925
I don't know what's funnier.

214
00:07:46,008 --> 00:07:48,010
You got a catch phrase
or that we peed on it.

215
00:07:48,094 --> 00:07:50,012
I want those mugs sterilized
and I want them destroyed.

216
00:07:50,096 --> 00:07:51,389
They're your mugs,
you do what you want.

217
00:07:51,472 --> 00:07:53,057
But I'm not touching them
with a 10-foot pole.

218
00:07:53,141 --> 00:07:55,059
You know how much
asparagus Luterman eats?

219
00:07:56,227 --> 00:07:57,478
Later, Chief. (CHUCKLES)

220
00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:08,406
How did it go this morning?

221
00:08:08,489 --> 00:08:09,490
I was petrified.

222
00:08:09,699 --> 00:08:11,242
Death row,
how could you not be?

223
00:08:11,325 --> 00:08:12,994
It was not just that.
When I got there,

224
00:08:13,077 --> 00:08:14,745
it hit me that if I do this,

225
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:16,998
I have a man's life
in my hands.

226
00:08:17,081 --> 00:08:18,374
Rachel, you can handle it.

227
00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:19,584
I know I can.

228
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:22,378
Then why do I get
the feeling that something
is bothering you?

229
00:08:22,461 --> 00:08:24,130
Because when
I got back from there,

230
00:08:24,213 --> 00:08:26,048
I was so angry about what
happened to that poor man

231
00:08:26,132 --> 00:08:27,592
that I sat down,
I started working

232
00:08:27,675 --> 00:08:28,759
on this case, and I...

233
00:08:29,135 --> 00:08:30,803
I haven't moved since.

234
00:08:30,887 --> 00:08:32,763
I don't understand.
Why is that bad?

235
00:08:33,055 --> 00:08:34,724
Because it's the first time
since Mike left

236
00:08:34,807 --> 00:08:36,392
that I haven't thought
about him every second.

237
00:08:39,145 --> 00:08:40,271
Listen to me.

238
00:08:41,355 --> 00:08:42,565
That's a good thing.

239
00:08:42,773 --> 00:08:44,025
It doesn't feel like
a good thing.

240
00:08:44,275 --> 00:08:46,652
Rachel, you can't live
your life on pins and needles.

241
00:08:46,736 --> 00:08:48,029
It's not healthy for you.

242
00:08:48,112 --> 00:08:50,072
It's not healthy for Mike.
It's not healthy for anyone.

243
00:08:50,156 --> 00:08:51,157
And forgetting
about him is healthy?

244
00:08:51,282 --> 00:08:52,491
Isn't that why
you took this case?

245
00:08:52,617 --> 00:08:54,118
To give yourself
something to focus on?

246
00:08:54,619 --> 00:08:56,537
Yes, but I just...
Then don't fight it.

247
00:08:56,954 --> 00:08:58,748
If working to free
an innocent man helps you

248
00:08:58,831 --> 00:09:00,499
to forget about Mike
for a while, he would be

249
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:02,376
the first person
to tell you to do it.

250
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:07,340
And trust me, if you really
lose yourself in this,

251
00:09:08,341 --> 00:09:10,301
I have a feeling it's going
to seem like a lot less than

252
00:09:10,384 --> 00:09:11,761
two years before he gets out.

253
00:09:23,022 --> 00:09:24,065
LOUIS: Where's Harvey?

254
00:09:24,148 --> 00:09:25,149
Harvey's not here.

255
00:09:25,233 --> 00:09:26,359
Well, get his ass in here,

256
00:09:26,442 --> 00:09:28,194
because he made some goddamn
side deal with those traders

257
00:09:28,277 --> 00:09:29,278
and I want them out.

258
00:09:29,362 --> 00:09:31,864
Louis, I am telling you,
now is not the time.

259
00:09:31,989 --> 00:09:33,991
And I am telling you
that I cannot look

260
00:09:34,075 --> 00:09:36,244
at their smug, stupid faces
for one more day.

261
00:09:36,494 --> 00:09:37,828
Maybe you don't have
to look at them.

262
00:09:38,246 --> 00:09:39,956
What are you talking about?
Louis, did I ever tell you

263
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:41,582
about my first apartment
in the city?

264
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:43,084
No.
I was sharing

265
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:44,585
a 400-square-foot studio

266
00:09:44,669 --> 00:09:47,088
and it was a disaster
until we finally decided

267
00:09:47,171 --> 00:09:49,048
that we had to separate
our spaces for privacy.

268
00:09:49,173 --> 00:09:50,716
Well, this isn't
<i>The Brady Bunch,</i> Donna.

269
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,802
We can't put
a masking tape line down
the center of the office.

270
00:09:52,885 --> 00:09:54,929
I'm not talking
about masking tape, Louis.

271
00:09:55,012 --> 00:09:56,847
I am talking
about hiring an architect

272
00:09:56,931 --> 00:09:58,683
to reconfigure the offices.

273
00:10:00,226 --> 00:10:01,227
(CHUCKLES) You're right.

274
00:10:01,602 --> 00:10:02,895
We can even do
a remodel, which is what

275
00:10:02,979 --> 00:10:04,605
I've been wanting
to do for the last
five years.

276
00:10:04,689 --> 00:10:06,190
And the best part is,
you don't have to deal

277
00:10:06,274 --> 00:10:08,150
with those asshole
traders ever again.

278
00:10:08,234 --> 00:10:09,527
Donna, you're a genius.
I know.

279
00:10:09,694 --> 00:10:11,320
Get me the names of six
architects before lunch.

280
00:10:11,404 --> 00:10:12,780
Louis, you have
your own secretary.

281
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:14,031
Thanks for nothing.

282
00:10:14,782 --> 00:10:16,325
Why do I even?

283
00:10:21,455 --> 00:10:22,748
Nice of you to show up.

284
00:10:22,832 --> 00:10:24,667
I've been peeling
these potatoes by myself.

285
00:10:25,251 --> 00:10:27,420
Sorry, I, uh, got caught up.

286
00:10:27,545 --> 00:10:29,630
Speaking of which,
how did it go
with your lawyer?

287
00:10:30,047 --> 00:10:31,173
You getting out of here?

288
00:10:31,882 --> 00:10:32,925
What?

289
00:10:33,551 --> 00:10:34,510
I'm just kidding.

290
00:10:34,593 --> 00:10:35,594
What's going on?

291
00:10:36,178 --> 00:10:37,179
Nothing.

292
00:10:38,472 --> 00:10:39,473
It's not important.

293
00:10:39,557 --> 00:10:40,975
Your lawyer shows up
without you knowing about it,

294
00:10:41,058 --> 00:10:42,184
and it's not important?

295
00:10:42,268 --> 00:10:43,561
Come on, do I look like
I was born yesterday?

296
00:10:43,644 --> 00:10:44,854
I just said
it's not important.

297
00:10:44,937 --> 00:10:46,314
And I'm sorry
I left you hanging,

298
00:10:46,397 --> 00:10:47,648
but you wouldn't even have
this job without me.

299
00:10:47,732 --> 00:10:49,900
And I wouldn't even need this
job if it weren't for you.

300
00:10:49,984 --> 00:10:51,402
So, what's your problem?

301
00:10:52,111 --> 00:10:53,404
I'm sorry, Kevin.
I'm...

302
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:57,366
I'm just not having
a good day.

303
00:10:58,409 --> 00:10:59,493
Hey, it's okay.
Don't sweat it.

304
00:10:59,577 --> 00:11:00,703
All right?

305
00:11:00,786 --> 00:11:02,496
I mean, it's none
of my business anyway.

306
00:11:04,749 --> 00:11:06,292
No, actually,
it is your business.

307
00:11:08,294 --> 00:11:11,630
He came here to tell me
that he tried to get Gallo
transferred, but...

308
00:11:13,507 --> 00:11:14,759
It's not going to happen.

309
00:11:15,593 --> 00:11:16,844
Well, as long as
we stick together,

310
00:11:16,927 --> 00:11:18,596
we can deal
with Gallo anyway, right?

311
00:11:20,056 --> 00:11:21,140
Yeah, that's...

312
00:11:21,223 --> 00:11:22,350
That's what I told Harvey.

313
00:11:24,852 --> 00:11:26,187
Well, next time
you talk to him,

314
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:27,438
tell him
I said thanks for trying.

315
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:35,196
How did it go?
He said he had

316
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:36,280
to think about it.

317
00:11:36,364 --> 00:11:37,865
What? Why?

318
00:11:37,948 --> 00:11:39,867
Because he's an idiot,
that's why.

319
00:11:40,034 --> 00:11:41,118
So, what are you
going to do?

320
00:11:41,202 --> 00:11:43,162
I'm going to figure out how
to buy us some time.

321
00:11:43,245 --> 00:11:45,122
Well, you better do it fast,
because Cahill's

322
00:11:45,206 --> 00:11:46,916
in your office,
and he wants an answer.

323
00:11:49,835 --> 00:11:50,961
Sean.

324
00:11:51,128 --> 00:11:52,129
What did he say?

325
00:11:52,296 --> 00:11:54,340
He said he wants
to see the details in writing.

326
00:11:54,423 --> 00:11:55,466
I'm not in the mood, Harvey.

327
00:11:55,549 --> 00:11:56,759
And I'm not messing around.

328
00:11:56,842 --> 00:11:58,052
Please tell me
you're kidding me.

329
00:11:58,803 --> 00:12:00,888
Oh, come on,
this is bullshit.
You know my word is good.

330
00:12:00,971 --> 00:12:02,056
HARVEY:
Yeah, and I told him that.

331
00:12:02,139 --> 00:12:03,808
And he doesn't want
to risk putting a target

332
00:12:03,891 --> 00:12:05,768
on his back and then find out
commuting his sentence

333
00:12:05,851 --> 00:12:07,353
really means
cutting it in half.

334
00:12:07,436 --> 00:12:09,647
He's not risking anything.
No one's going to find out.

335
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:11,941
I'm sure that's exactly
what Frank Gallo thought.

336
00:12:12,024 --> 00:12:14,360
So, either put it in writing
or we don't have a deal.

337
00:12:16,654 --> 00:12:18,489
He didn't go for it, did he?

338
00:12:18,614 --> 00:12:19,615
What are you talking about?

339
00:12:19,698 --> 00:12:21,409
Mike being at risk
has nothing to do

340
00:12:21,492 --> 00:12:22,576
with putting
anything in writing.

341
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:23,994
And you told me
he wouldn't go for it.

342
00:12:24,078 --> 00:12:26,580
So, Harvey,
tell me the truth.

343
00:12:28,165 --> 00:12:30,251
All right, he said no.
But, Sean,

344
00:12:30,334 --> 00:12:31,460
I'm telling you
he'll come around.

345
00:12:31,544 --> 00:12:32,711
He just needs
a couple of days.

346
00:12:32,795 --> 00:12:35,172
Do you know
how many strings I pulled
to put this thing in motion?

347
00:12:35,256 --> 00:12:37,466
What I know is you wouldn't
have pulled anything

348
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:39,093
if this case
wasn't huge for you.

349
00:12:39,176 --> 00:12:41,053
So, instead of yelling at me
for saying that it's going

350
00:12:41,137 --> 00:12:43,639
to take a couple days,
why don't you just give me
a couple of days?

351
00:12:43,722 --> 00:12:45,975
Okay, Harvey,
the deal's still
on the table.

352
00:12:46,225 --> 00:12:47,601
But if I find a way
to move forward

353
00:12:47,685 --> 00:12:49,145
without his help,
there is no deal,

354
00:12:49,228 --> 00:12:50,688
and he does
the whole two years.

355
00:13:05,661 --> 00:13:06,704
Jessica.

356
00:13:06,787 --> 00:13:07,788
Harvey.

357
00:13:07,872 --> 00:13:09,081
What's going on with Mike?

358
00:13:09,165 --> 00:13:10,875
I gave him Cahill's offer.

359
00:13:11,542 --> 00:13:13,294
And he's thinking about it?
I'm working on it.

360
00:13:13,377 --> 00:13:15,129
Well, in the meantime,
while you were out,

361
00:13:15,212 --> 00:13:16,922
I got a call
from Nathan Byrnes.

362
00:13:17,006 --> 00:13:18,632
He thinks someone's trying
to take over his company.

363
00:13:18,716 --> 00:13:19,800
Why the hell
would he think that?

364
00:13:19,884 --> 00:13:21,886
Because word on the street
is someone's selling off

365
00:13:21,969 --> 00:13:23,137
a block of his stock.

366
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,221
That doesn't make sense.

367
00:13:24,305 --> 00:13:26,098
We bought Sutter's
shares from him.

368
00:13:27,391 --> 00:13:29,185
Those goddamn traders.
No way.

369
00:13:29,268 --> 00:13:30,603
They wouldn't do that
without telling me.

370
00:13:30,686 --> 00:13:32,396
They bought it in good faith.
Well, they're dumping it

371
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,647
in bad faith.

372
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:36,901
I'll take care of it.
No.

373
00:13:36,984 --> 00:13:38,569
You have your hands
full with Mike.

374
00:13:39,403 --> 00:13:40,571
I can handle this.

375
00:13:40,654 --> 00:13:42,531
Jessica, it was my idea
to involve them.

376
00:13:42,615 --> 00:13:43,991
I should be the one
to take care of it.

377
00:13:44,074 --> 00:13:45,743
I don't care
whose idea it was, Harvey.

378
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,286
You take care of Mike.

379
00:13:56,295 --> 00:13:57,505
(PHONE RINGING)

380
00:14:01,008 --> 00:14:02,009
Hello?

381
00:14:02,092 --> 00:14:04,720
AUTOMATED VOICE:
<i>You have a call from
Danbury Federal Prison.</i>

382
00:14:04,803 --> 00:14:06,013
<i>Do you accept the charges?</i>

383
00:14:06,096 --> 00:14:07,306
Yes, of course.

384
00:14:08,516 --> 00:14:10,142
<i>Mike, is everything okay?</i>

385
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:12,269
Yeah. Yeah, everything's fine.

386
00:14:12,436 --> 00:14:14,021
I was just thinking
about you.

387
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:15,856
I was thinking
about you, too.

388
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:17,024
You were?
Yes.

389
00:14:17,107 --> 00:14:20,027
In fact, I was just
in the middle of a heated

390
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:21,320
discussion with you about

391
00:14:21,403 --> 00:14:23,739
the best way to handle
a death row appeal.

392
00:14:23,822 --> 00:14:24,865
I don't understand.

393
00:14:24,949 --> 00:14:26,867
<i>I took on
an Innocence Project case</i>

394
00:14:26,951 --> 00:14:29,036
just to have something
to take my mind off
of our troubles.

395
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:30,120
But I...

396
00:14:31,205 --> 00:14:33,332
I didn't want
to take my mind off of you.

397
00:14:33,415 --> 00:14:36,835
<i>So, I figured I would
just imagine we were working
on it together.</i>

398
00:14:37,127 --> 00:14:38,420
I don't know what to say.

399
00:14:39,129 --> 00:14:40,589
<i>Say you're in.</i>

400
00:14:41,924 --> 00:14:44,134
I mean, that depends
on what strategy
we landed on.

401
00:14:44,218 --> 00:14:45,302
<i>Mike, seriously.</i>

402
00:14:45,469 --> 00:14:47,012
Is there something wrong?
MIKE: <i>No.</i>

403
00:14:47,096 --> 00:14:48,556
<i>I just wanted to make sure
you were doing okay.</i>

404
00:14:49,974 --> 00:14:51,559
And that...

405
00:14:51,642 --> 00:14:53,143
That we were still good.

406
00:14:53,477 --> 00:14:55,145
<i>Now that I have
something to take my mind</i>

407
00:14:55,229 --> 00:14:56,355
<i>off our situation</i>

408
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,857
and connect me
to you at the same time...

409
00:14:59,858 --> 00:15:00,859
Yeah.

410
00:15:01,485 --> 00:15:02,736
We're better than good.

411
00:15:07,449 --> 00:15:10,077
Then can you do me a favor
and transfer me to Donna?

412
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,829
Of course.
Can I ask why?

413
00:15:12,454 --> 00:15:14,415
I only get one phone call
and I'm pretty sure

414
00:15:14,498 --> 00:15:16,125
she had something
to do with the idea

415
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:19,378
of you imagining us
working together.

416
00:15:19,461 --> 00:15:21,422
So, I just want to thank her.
<i>Okay.</i>

417
00:15:22,047 --> 00:15:24,174
I love you.
MIKE: <i>I love you, too.</i>

418
00:15:26,677 --> 00:15:27,928
(RINGING)

419
00:15:28,637 --> 00:15:29,763
Hello?

420
00:15:29,847 --> 00:15:31,348
RACHEL: <i>Donna,
I have Mike on the phone.</i>

421
00:15:31,432 --> 00:15:32,558
Put him through.

422
00:15:33,684 --> 00:15:34,768
Hello?
MIKE: <i>Donna.</i>

423
00:15:34,852 --> 00:15:36,270
If Harvey's there,
do me a favor.

424
00:15:36,353 --> 00:15:37,896
Keep your voice down,
and don't tell him it's me.

425
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,273
Mike, what's going on?

426
00:15:39,356 --> 00:15:40,941
I'm not taking
the deal, Donna.

427
00:15:41,025 --> 00:15:42,192
Are you crazy?

428
00:15:42,276 --> 00:15:43,360
<i>It's not that simple.</i>

429
00:15:43,444 --> 00:15:44,820
What's not simple about it?

430
00:15:44,903 --> 00:15:46,614
Harvey said that if you...
<i>I don't care what Harvey said.</i>

431
00:15:46,697 --> 00:15:49,116
Because what he didn't say
is that if I do what he wants

432
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:50,534
and someone finds out,
then I may never get back

433
00:15:50,618 --> 00:15:52,453
to Rachel at all.
<i>Harvey would never</i>

434
00:15:52,536 --> 00:15:53,954
<i>let them find out.</i>
Donna, look, I called you

435
00:15:54,038 --> 00:15:55,623
so that I didn't have to have
this argument with him.

436
00:15:55,706 --> 00:15:57,583
Now, I don't have much time.

437
00:15:57,666 --> 00:15:59,335
Are you going
to do this for me or not?

438
00:16:00,294 --> 00:16:01,962
I'll tell him.
<i>Then I also need you</i>

439
00:16:02,046 --> 00:16:03,297
<i>to tell him
something else for me.</i>

440
00:16:03,756 --> 00:16:05,716
If he comes here
to try to change my mind,

441
00:16:06,133 --> 00:16:07,843
I'm not going to see him.

442
00:16:09,345 --> 00:16:10,346
(MIKE HANGS UP)

443
00:16:14,558 --> 00:16:15,976
You mind telling me
who the hell said

444
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:18,646
you can dump Nathan Byrnes'
stock without talking to us?

445
00:16:18,729 --> 00:16:19,813
I don't know what you're
talking about.

446
00:16:19,897 --> 00:16:20,981
Who's Nathan Byrnes?

447
00:16:21,065 --> 00:16:22,399
CEO of Exodyne.

448
00:16:22,483 --> 00:16:23,817
Oh, that Nathan Byrnes.

449
00:16:23,901 --> 00:16:26,987
In that case,
I said I could sell
that stock because I own it.

450
00:16:27,071 --> 00:16:30,741
Just like I own this one
and this one and this one.

451
00:16:30,991 --> 00:16:32,534
Hey, look at that.
My Neubacher Capital

452
00:16:32,618 --> 00:16:34,119
position's going
through the roof.

453
00:16:34,203 --> 00:16:35,996
That's not the deal you made
with Harvey, and you know it.

454
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:38,165
Welcome to the big bad
world of Wall Street.

455
00:16:38,248 --> 00:16:40,501
Now, do you want something
or can I get back to work?

456
00:16:40,584 --> 00:16:42,336
Oh, I want something.
You're going to unwind

457
00:16:42,419 --> 00:16:43,837
that sale and buy
those shares back.

458
00:16:43,921 --> 00:16:45,714
At a premium?
Not going to happen.

459
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:47,800
I'm your landlord.
And the fact you had
to lease

460
00:16:47,883 --> 00:16:49,426
to me means you don't have
much of an operation.

461
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:51,136
You listen to me,
you little piss-ant.

462
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:52,346
You don't know
who you're messing with.

463
00:16:52,429 --> 00:16:53,806
Then why don't I find out?

464
00:16:53,889 --> 00:16:55,307
Over dinner.

465
00:16:55,391 --> 00:16:56,892
You've got to be
kidding me.

466
00:16:56,975 --> 00:16:59,395
You want me to have dinner
with you in exchange

467
00:16:59,478 --> 00:17:01,814
for backing off that trade?
I think of it as you get

468
00:17:01,897 --> 00:17:03,691
to have dinner with me
and I choose to back off

469
00:17:03,774 --> 00:17:05,484
that trade
because I am a stand-up guy.

470
00:17:05,567 --> 00:17:07,945
Well, let me let you in
on a little something,
there, Stu.

471
00:17:08,112 --> 00:17:10,989
I don't share dinner staring
down the barrel of a shotgun.

472
00:17:11,198 --> 00:17:12,741
So, why don't you
unwind that trade

473
00:17:12,825 --> 00:17:14,159
and then ask me out?

474
00:17:14,243 --> 00:17:16,328
And then we'll see if you're
as charming as you like

475
00:17:16,412 --> 00:17:17,538
to think you are.
You know what?

476
00:17:17,621 --> 00:17:19,164
I am charming.
But I'm not an idiot

477
00:17:19,248 --> 00:17:22,000
and I'm not unwinding
my trade without getting
something in return.

478
00:17:36,557 --> 00:17:37,808
Harvey, I need to talk
to you about something

479
00:17:37,891 --> 00:17:38,934
and you're
not going to like it.

480
00:17:38,976 --> 00:17:41,562
About what?
That was Mike
on the phone before.

481
00:17:41,937 --> 00:17:43,063
Why didn't you get me?

482
00:17:43,147 --> 00:17:44,732
He's not taking
the deal, Harvey.

483
00:17:44,815 --> 00:17:46,108
The hell he isn't.

484
00:17:47,025 --> 00:17:48,318
Where are you going?

485
00:17:48,902 --> 00:17:51,572
To that prison.
Harvey, the reason
he called me and not you

486
00:17:51,655 --> 00:17:53,407
is because he knew you
wouldn't take no for answer.

487
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:54,575
And I'm not going to.

488
00:17:54,658 --> 00:17:56,410
Which is why he said
if you show up there,

489
00:17:56,493 --> 00:17:58,120
he's not going
to leave his cell.

490
00:17:58,203 --> 00:17:59,246
Then get me Rachel.

491
00:17:59,329 --> 00:18:01,248
No, no. Harvey,
you cannot tell her.

492
00:18:01,457 --> 00:18:04,084
Like hell I can't.
She's the only one
who can convince him.

493
00:18:04,168 --> 00:18:06,211
If you tell her that
Mike's not taking a deal

494
00:18:06,295 --> 00:18:08,088
that can get him out,
it will tear her apart.

495
00:18:08,172 --> 00:18:10,924
And if I don't tell her,
he's going to be in there
for two more years.

496
00:18:11,008 --> 00:18:12,009
Is that what she wants?

497
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:13,719
That's between them.
That's why I want to
tell her.

498
00:18:13,802 --> 00:18:15,012
She'll make it between them.

499
00:18:15,095 --> 00:18:16,096
Harvey.

500
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:19,016
God damn it.
He plays <i>Checkers</i>
with this guy

501
00:18:19,099 --> 00:18:20,100
and thinks
he owes him his life.

502
00:18:20,184 --> 00:18:21,685
No, that's not fair
and you know it.

503
00:18:21,769 --> 00:18:23,061
Because Mike's loyalty
is the reason

504
00:18:23,145 --> 00:18:24,188
you're not in prison.

505
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:28,400
That's what's
killing me, Donna.
Don't you understand?

506
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:34,114
He's in there instead of me
with a guy I put away.

507
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:37,159
And I can't just sit here
doing nothing

508
00:18:37,242 --> 00:18:39,286
when he has a chance
to get out.

509
00:18:39,536 --> 00:18:41,371
Which is why you have
to think of something else.

510
00:18:42,206 --> 00:18:43,707
Because if you tell Rachel
about this,

511
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:45,876
the life that's waiting
for Mike when he gets out,

512
00:18:47,002 --> 00:18:48,212
it isn't going to be there.

513
00:18:57,429 --> 00:18:58,430
Harvey.

514
00:18:58,806 --> 00:19:00,349
I'm surprised
to see you here so soon.

515
00:19:00,432 --> 00:19:01,809
I didn't think you'd
turn him this fast.

516
00:19:01,892 --> 00:19:03,727
I need more time.
I don't think you understand.

517
00:19:03,811 --> 00:19:05,896
I'm being pressured to move
to another investigation.

518
00:19:05,979 --> 00:19:07,439
You've got 24 hours
to change his mind

519
00:19:07,523 --> 00:19:08,607
or this thing is done.

520
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:10,150
Then I need you
to do something for me.

521
00:19:10,234 --> 00:19:11,318
I am doing something for you.

522
00:19:11,401 --> 00:19:12,694
I'm getting Mike
out of prison.

523
00:19:12,778 --> 00:19:14,613
Well, you need
to do something else for me

524
00:19:14,696 --> 00:19:16,323
or that's never
going to happen.

525
00:19:17,241 --> 00:19:18,534
What are you talking about?

526
00:19:19,076 --> 00:19:20,828
I need you to get
into a room with him

527
00:19:20,911 --> 00:19:23,038
because he won't listen
to what I have to say.

528
00:19:23,121 --> 00:19:24,456
What exactly
do you want me to tell him

529
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:25,541
that you haven't already?

530
00:19:25,624 --> 00:19:27,167
Sean, Mike's a bleeding heart.

531
00:19:27,251 --> 00:19:29,336
You need to make
the case directly to him.

532
00:19:29,419 --> 00:19:32,130
He needs to see
the victims of whatever
the hell this guy did.

533
00:19:32,214 --> 00:19:34,424
That's a swell idea, Harvey.
But if I go into that prison

534
00:19:34,508 --> 00:19:36,718
and someone sees me,
not only are we dead
in the water,

535
00:19:36,802 --> 00:19:38,220
but Mike's life
isn't worth shit.

536
00:19:38,303 --> 00:19:40,681
You think I don't know that?
What the hell do you think
I'm doing here?

537
00:19:40,764 --> 00:19:42,641
What are you talking about?
I have a plan,

538
00:19:42,724 --> 00:19:44,601
but you're
not going to like it.
Why not?

539
00:19:44,685 --> 00:19:46,520
Because I need you
to pull another string

540
00:19:46,603 --> 00:19:48,939
and I need you to do it
before Frank Gallo tries

541
00:19:49,022 --> 00:19:50,357
something else with Mike.

542
00:19:59,157 --> 00:20:00,492
All right, fake lawyer.

543
00:20:00,576 --> 00:20:01,827
Let's see what you got.

544
00:20:03,579 --> 00:20:05,122
You're going to let me look
into it for you?

545
00:20:05,205 --> 00:20:06,790
Look into it, shit.

546
00:20:06,999 --> 00:20:08,750
You're going to get me
out of here like you promised.

547
00:20:08,834 --> 00:20:09,918
I never promised.

548
00:20:10,002 --> 00:20:11,461
I said there was an excellent
chance you could get...

549
00:20:11,545 --> 00:20:12,880
Six weeks, brother.

550
00:20:12,963 --> 00:20:14,464
I'll be counting the days.

551
00:20:15,966 --> 00:20:17,759
I'll file the motion
first thing in the morning.

552
00:20:17,885 --> 00:20:18,886
There you go.

553
00:20:18,969 --> 00:20:20,846
That's what
I'm talking about.

554
00:20:21,013 --> 00:20:23,307
And if I find out you're
screwing me on any level,

555
00:20:23,807 --> 00:20:26,476
you better hole up in some
dark corner of this prison

556
00:20:26,727 --> 00:20:28,687
and pray to God
I don't find your ass.

557
00:20:36,653 --> 00:20:38,071
What was that all about?

558
00:20:40,407 --> 00:20:42,743
Looks like he took me up
on my offer after all.

559
00:20:56,006 --> 00:20:58,300
God damn it, Gretchen,
where the hell is she?
Where the hell is who?

560
00:20:58,383 --> 00:21:00,010
That architect
you were supposed to call.

561
00:21:00,093 --> 00:21:02,429
She's not supposed to be here
for another half hour.

562
00:21:02,512 --> 00:21:04,097
And if I want
someone's business,

563
00:21:04,181 --> 00:21:06,058
I show up a half hour
early at the latest.

564
00:21:06,141 --> 00:21:07,851
And what exactly
are you looking
to have me do

565
00:21:07,935 --> 00:21:09,186
about your little conundrum?

566
00:21:09,269 --> 00:21:10,812
I want you to give her
a call and tell her

567
00:21:10,896 --> 00:21:12,648
if she doesn't have
the goddamn common courtesy

568
00:21:12,731 --> 00:21:14,942
to show up early,
then she might as well
not show up at all.

569
00:21:15,025 --> 00:21:16,151
Mr. Litt.
Ah...

570
00:21:16,735 --> 00:21:18,278
Yes.

571
00:21:18,362 --> 00:21:21,365
I'm Tara Messer.
I'm here to discuss
your remodel needs.

572
00:21:21,448 --> 00:21:23,116
My needs?
GRETCHEN: Well, I'm sorry,

573
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,952
Ms. Was Going To Be
Our Architect,

574
00:21:25,035 --> 00:21:26,036
we no longer need
your services.

575
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:27,245
Gretchen, calm down.

576
00:21:27,329 --> 00:21:29,122
You are overreacting
like a crazy woman.

577
00:21:29,206 --> 00:21:30,332
You're hired.

578
00:21:30,415 --> 00:21:31,792
I am?
Oh, yeah.

579
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:34,044
You're right for the job.
I can feel it.

580
00:21:34,127 --> 00:21:35,629
Oh, you can feel something,
all right.

581
00:21:35,712 --> 00:21:36,922
Then why don't we start

582
00:21:37,005 --> 00:21:38,757
with what you're
looking for in the space?

583
00:21:39,925 --> 00:21:41,343
Oh, the space.

584
00:21:41,551 --> 00:21:42,636
Right, the space.

585
00:21:42,719 --> 00:21:45,555
Exactly. What I'm looking for
are clear, yet unobtrusive

586
00:21:45,639 --> 00:21:47,683
boundaries between
our offices and the tenants'.

587
00:21:47,766 --> 00:21:52,062
But it needs to be elegant
and organic or we might
as well not do it at all.

588
00:21:52,145 --> 00:21:53,397
I understand.

589
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:57,150
Like the perfect aria
leading seamlessly

590
00:21:57,234 --> 00:21:58,735
to its inevitable cadenza.

591
00:21:58,819 --> 00:22:00,028
You're an opera lover.

592
00:22:00,112 --> 00:22:01,196
Second only to the ballet.

593
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:02,656
Then I suggest
we start with a marriage.

594
00:22:02,739 --> 00:22:03,949
I mean, a tour.

595
00:22:13,959 --> 00:22:14,960
Excuse me.

596
00:22:15,085 --> 00:22:16,503
Professor Dunbar.
Do you have a moment?

597
00:22:16,586 --> 00:22:18,255
This is the faculty lounge,
Ms. Zane.

598
00:22:18,338 --> 00:22:19,339
You're not supposed
to be in here.

599
00:22:19,423 --> 00:22:20,674
I understand that.
And I'm sorry.

600
00:22:20,757 --> 00:22:21,842
It's just,
this is important

601
00:22:21,925 --> 00:22:23,260
and you weren't
in your office.

602
00:22:23,927 --> 00:22:25,053
What can I do for you?

603
00:22:25,137 --> 00:22:27,347
I met with Leonard Bailey
yesterday.

604
00:22:27,431 --> 00:22:28,724
He's the inmate on death...
I know who he is.

605
00:22:28,807 --> 00:22:30,600
Is there a problem?
Yes, there is.

606
00:22:30,684 --> 00:22:32,185
He's rotting on death row

607
00:22:32,269 --> 00:22:33,895
for a crime
that he didn't commit.

608
00:22:33,979 --> 00:22:36,023
So, you met with him
for 10 minutes

609
00:22:36,106 --> 00:22:37,482
and you're ready
to release him.

610
00:22:37,566 --> 00:22:38,692
No, what I'm saying is...
You're a second-year

611
00:22:38,775 --> 00:22:40,110
law student, Rachel.

612
00:22:40,193 --> 00:22:42,863
I asked you to be a part
of this because you're
one of my brightest students,

613
00:22:42,946 --> 00:22:44,281
but I also asked you
in particular

614
00:22:44,364 --> 00:22:46,867
because I didn't think
you'd be so naive.

615
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:48,035
Excuse me?

616
00:22:48,118 --> 00:22:50,579
Your job wasn't to talk
to Mr. Bailey once and,

617
00:22:50,662 --> 00:22:52,497
after being moved
by his tale of woe,

618
00:22:52,581 --> 00:22:54,541
tell me to jump him
to the top of the pile.

619
00:22:54,624 --> 00:22:56,960
It was to assess his case
and present evidence.

620
00:22:57,044 --> 00:22:58,420
And that's exactly
what I'm doing here.

621
00:22:58,503 --> 00:23:01,715
I just left two boxes
of textbook
prosecutorial misconduct

622
00:23:01,798 --> 00:23:03,216
with your secretary.

623
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:05,761
You found
all of that since yesterday.

624
00:23:05,844 --> 00:23:07,471
Yes. Because while
I may only

625
00:23:07,554 --> 00:23:09,264
be a second-year law student,
I have been a practicing

626
00:23:09,347 --> 00:23:11,641
paralegal for the past
eight years.

627
00:23:13,018 --> 00:23:15,145
Looks like I have
some reading to do.

628
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:18,440
I'm sorry
for interrupting your day.

629
00:23:18,523 --> 00:23:20,150
Good afternoon, Ms. Zane.

630
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:21,777
Good afternoon, Professor.

631
00:23:27,324 --> 00:23:29,868
And then we use
the glass motif
you already have

632
00:23:29,993 --> 00:23:32,996
to partition their space
from yours starting
at that wall over there.

633
00:23:34,164 --> 00:23:36,750
And no one ever knows
they're two separate entities.

634
00:23:36,833 --> 00:23:39,127
And if we use
the frosted glass,

635
00:23:39,211 --> 00:23:41,171
you'll never even have
to lay eyes on them.

636
00:23:41,254 --> 00:23:42,923
Well, there's just
one more thing.

637
00:23:43,006 --> 00:23:44,758
You want to know
if I can design another

638
00:23:44,841 --> 00:23:46,134
bullpen area
for your side.

639
00:23:46,218 --> 00:23:47,928
After all, it's the heart
and soul of the space.

640
00:23:48,011 --> 00:23:50,430
You get that?
It's my job to get that.

641
00:23:51,181 --> 00:23:52,182
I don't understand.

642
00:23:52,265 --> 00:23:55,393
To me, architecture isn't
just about design.

643
00:23:55,477 --> 00:23:57,187
It's... It's about
connecting with my clients

644
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:58,522
on an intimate level.

645
00:23:59,106 --> 00:24:00,482
Well, you're very good at it.

646
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:03,652
You know, it's too bad
you already sublet
to someone else.

647
00:24:03,735 --> 00:24:05,278
We're looking
to expand ourselves.

648
00:24:05,362 --> 00:24:06,780
This space
would have been perfect.

649
00:24:06,863 --> 00:24:08,573
Are you serious?
Yeah.

650
00:24:08,865 --> 00:24:10,492
In fact, it's so perfect,
I would have made you

651
00:24:10,575 --> 00:24:12,452
an offer on the spot.

652
00:24:12,536 --> 00:24:15,872
Anyway, I'll have some plans
drawn up as soon as I can.

653
00:24:26,341 --> 00:24:27,467
We need to get rid
of those traders.

654
00:24:27,551 --> 00:24:28,552
Excuse me?

655
00:24:28,635 --> 00:24:30,637
I don't care
what kind of deal you
and Harvey cut with them.

656
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,514
We need to get rid of them
and we need to do it now.

657
00:24:32,597 --> 00:24:33,890
Well, Louis,
I'm not going to do that.

658
00:24:33,974 --> 00:24:35,517
Because whoever
we replace them with,

659
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,519
this conversation
is just going
to happen again.

660
00:24:37,602 --> 00:24:39,604
Because we both know
that you're out of your mind.

661
00:24:39,688 --> 00:24:40,689
It's not going
to happen again.

662
00:24:40,772 --> 00:24:41,982
Because
in this particular case,

663
00:24:42,065 --> 00:24:43,191
I am not out of my mind.

664
00:24:43,275 --> 00:24:44,276
Why do you
want me to do this?

665
00:24:44,359 --> 00:24:45,902
Because I'm in love
with an architect.

666
00:24:46,236 --> 00:24:47,320
Let me get this straight.

667
00:24:47,404 --> 00:24:49,156
You want me to further
antagonize people

668
00:24:49,239 --> 00:24:50,615
that I'm already
fighting with
because you don't have

669
00:24:50,699 --> 00:24:51,867
the balls to ask
a woman out on a date.

670
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:52,951
That's one way
of looking at it.

671
00:24:53,034 --> 00:24:54,661
No, there's another way.
The answer is no.

672
00:24:54,744 --> 00:24:55,829
Okay, fine.

673
00:24:55,912 --> 00:24:57,497
I'll just stick
to the original plan

674
00:24:57,581 --> 00:24:58,832
of having her completely
redesign our space.

675
00:24:58,915 --> 00:25:00,208
And I'll just make sure
it takes long enough

676
00:25:00,292 --> 00:25:01,334
for her to fall madly
in love with me.

677
00:25:01,418 --> 00:25:02,878
And it shouldn't take
more than two or three years.

678
00:25:02,961 --> 00:25:04,921
Louis, I want you
to look at me
when I say this.

679
00:25:06,006 --> 00:25:08,842
If you hire this woman
to do anything relating

680
00:25:08,925 --> 00:25:11,178
to this firm's space,
I will personally

681
00:25:11,261 --> 00:25:12,596
throw you off the roof
of this building.

682
00:25:12,679 --> 00:25:13,847
Is that clear?

683
00:25:14,431 --> 00:25:16,266
So, you'll think about it?
Get out.

684
00:25:22,105 --> 00:25:23,106
Yo.

685
00:25:23,231 --> 00:25:24,316
(IN AUSTRIAN ACCENT) Ahnold.

686
00:25:24,691 --> 00:25:27,027
Come on.
Let's see what you got.

687
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,154
I didn't know you played.
Played?

688
00:25:29,237 --> 00:25:32,657
Shit. I set
the P.S. 92 single game
scoring record.

689
00:25:33,617 --> 00:25:36,369
P.S. 92 is
an elementary school,
my friend.

690
00:25:36,453 --> 00:25:38,580
Yeah, sixth grade.
I dominated.

691
00:25:39,414 --> 00:25:42,209
KEVIN: I thought you had
to file that motion
for Gallo's parole.

692
00:25:42,292 --> 00:25:43,668
MIKE: I did.
Already?

693
00:25:43,752 --> 00:25:45,378
It was an 18-page
sentencing amendment.

694
00:25:45,462 --> 00:25:46,546
I could do that in my sleep.

695
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:48,423
I should get you
to do some work for me.

696
00:25:48,506 --> 00:25:50,050
Why? You need some?

697
00:25:50,133 --> 00:25:51,968
No, but if I did,
I'd probably get myself

698
00:25:52,052 --> 00:25:54,012
a lawyer who didn't sleep
in a prison.

699
00:25:55,305 --> 00:25:56,514
(CLEARS THROAT)

700
00:25:56,890 --> 00:25:58,308
You all right?
(CLEARS THROAT)

701
00:25:58,892 --> 00:26:00,560
I don't...
I don't know.

702
00:26:00,644 --> 00:26:01,686
What do you mean,
you don't know?

703
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:03,188
(COUGHS)
What is it, your stomach?

704
00:26:03,813 --> 00:26:04,898
Oh, my God.
Something's not right.

705
00:26:04,981 --> 00:26:06,733
Take a deep breath.
Put your head down.

706
00:26:06,816 --> 00:26:09,069
Oh, God. I can't.
That's not going
to do anything.

707
00:26:09,152 --> 00:26:10,195
I think...

708
00:26:10,278 --> 00:26:12,072
Oh, my God, I think
somebody did something to me.

709
00:26:12,155 --> 00:26:13,740
Hey, can I get
some help over here?

710
00:26:13,823 --> 00:26:15,867
Guard! Mike, talk to me.

711
00:26:15,951 --> 00:26:17,869
(BREATHES HEAVILY)
It's Gallo.

712
00:26:17,994 --> 00:26:19,913
Gallo must have put
something in my...

713
00:26:19,996 --> 00:26:21,957
Somebody do something!
Guard!

714
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,416
Call Harvey.

715
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:24,751
Guard!

716
00:26:24,834 --> 00:26:25,877
Mike.

717
00:26:26,544 --> 00:26:27,629
Mike!

718
00:26:38,848 --> 00:26:39,933
Where is he?

719
00:26:40,016 --> 00:26:41,935
If I knew who
you were talking about,
maybe I could...

720
00:26:42,018 --> 00:26:43,478
Mike Ross.
I need to see him right now.

721
00:26:43,561 --> 00:26:45,272
And who are you?
Harvey Specter.

722
00:26:45,355 --> 00:26:46,564
I'm his attorney.

723
00:26:49,901 --> 00:26:51,528
Mr. Ross
is in the infirmary,

724
00:26:51,611 --> 00:26:53,029
but you can't
see him in there.

725
00:26:53,196 --> 00:26:54,406
Then get me the warden.

726
00:26:57,909 --> 00:27:00,287
I don't appreciate
being pushed around,
Mr. Specter.

727
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:02,247
I don't care.
I want everyone

728
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:03,540
to know what
happened here today.

729
00:27:03,623 --> 00:27:04,624
They saw what happened.

730
00:27:04,708 --> 00:27:07,085
Yeah, there's a difference
between seeing and knowing.

731
00:27:09,004 --> 00:27:10,797
Are you Kevin Miller?
Who are you?

732
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,841
Harvey Specter.
I'm Mike Ross' lawyer.

733
00:27:12,924 --> 00:27:15,218
Look, I already told
the warden I didn't see
anyone touch his food.

734
00:27:15,302 --> 00:27:17,012
Did you see Frank Gallo
with him?

735
00:27:18,513 --> 00:27:19,639
Did you or didn't you?

736
00:27:19,723 --> 00:27:20,849
Are you trying
to get me killed, man?

737
00:27:20,932 --> 00:27:22,225
Did he touch
his food or not?

738
00:27:23,101 --> 00:27:25,687
Yeah, he did,
last night at dinner.

739
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:27,647
But Mike offered
to get Gallo parole

740
00:27:27,731 --> 00:27:29,357
and Gallo took him up on it,
so why would he poison him?

741
00:27:29,441 --> 00:27:31,818
Because he didn't really
take Mike up on that offer,

742
00:27:31,901 --> 00:27:33,695
he just did it
to get close to him.

743
00:27:33,778 --> 00:27:36,990
Or he did it to give Mike
a taste of what happens
if he doesn't come through.

744
00:27:37,073 --> 00:27:39,701
Either way,
you stay the hell away
from that son of a bitch.

745
00:27:39,784 --> 00:27:41,828
All right, that's enough.
Let's go.

746
00:27:43,913 --> 00:27:45,123
GALLO: Hey, Counselor.

747
00:27:45,206 --> 00:27:47,667
I heard your boy had
a little tummy ache
out in the yard.

748
00:27:47,751 --> 00:27:49,753
You piece of shit.
You goddamn poisoned him.

749
00:27:49,836 --> 00:27:52,005
Guards, get him out of here.
I didn't do shit.

750
00:27:52,088 --> 00:27:54,174
Why don't you come over here
and say that to my face?

751
00:27:54,257 --> 00:27:55,800
You think I won't?
God damn it.

752
00:27:55,884 --> 00:27:57,677
I said get him back
to his cell!

753
00:27:57,761 --> 00:27:59,262
Hey. This wasn't
part of the deal.

754
00:27:59,346 --> 00:28:02,265
We talked about
you seeing his roommate,
not rushing Frank Gallo.

755
00:28:02,349 --> 00:28:05,268
Yeah, well, my guy's lying
unconscious in the infirmary.

756
00:28:05,352 --> 00:28:06,644
So, sue me.

757
00:28:13,234 --> 00:28:14,861
How did you know Gallo
would take the bait?

758
00:28:14,944 --> 00:28:16,112
Because he's an animal.

759
00:28:16,196 --> 00:28:17,489
And animals always
take the bait.

760
00:28:17,572 --> 00:28:19,908
Well, I'll give you credit
for knowing how
it would go down.

761
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:22,035
I don't need credit.

762
00:28:22,118 --> 00:28:23,536
I need to know
where Mike Ross is.

763
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:25,372
Where I was instructed
to put him.

764
00:28:25,455 --> 00:28:27,707
Let me tell you something,
Mr. Specter.
I don't know you.

765
00:28:27,791 --> 00:28:29,125
So, in case you're thinking
of trying anything,

766
00:28:29,209 --> 00:28:30,710
that kid has
a monitor on his leg.

767
00:28:30,794 --> 00:28:32,629
And if it goes dark
for even one second,

768
00:28:32,712 --> 00:28:35,215
I'm going to make sure
that you end up
in a cell here with him.

769
00:28:35,298 --> 00:28:38,760
It's not going to go dark
and he'll be back here
when I said he would.

770
00:28:38,843 --> 00:28:43,264
Then, after that,
I'm going to make sure
he gets out of here. For good.

771
00:29:10,834 --> 00:29:12,669
HARVEY:
How are you feeling?

772
00:29:18,425 --> 00:29:19,592
What's going on?

773
00:29:20,844 --> 00:29:21,845
Where am I?

774
00:29:22,262 --> 00:29:24,681
You're in the back of my car.
You were drugged.

775
00:29:26,516 --> 00:29:28,518
By Gallo.
By me.

776
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:32,647
What?
Cahill got the warden

777
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:34,774
and the prison doctor
to put something
in your food.

778
00:29:34,858 --> 00:29:36,401
They're the only ones
who know what's going on.

779
00:29:36,484 --> 00:29:37,819
What the hell
are you talking about?

780
00:29:37,986 --> 00:29:40,447
We needed to change your mind
about taking this deal.

781
00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:42,365
And we couldn't do it
as long as you're in there.

782
00:29:42,449 --> 00:29:44,701
Jesus Christ.
So, you drugged me?

783
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:47,328
We needed a cover for why
you're not in your cell,

784
00:29:47,412 --> 00:29:48,746
and this was
the only way to do it.

785
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:51,124
Are you insane?
You broke me out of prison?

786
00:29:51,207 --> 00:29:52,542
I didn't break you
out of anywhere.

787
00:29:52,625 --> 00:29:53,793
Cahill sanctioned it.

788
00:29:53,877 --> 00:29:56,045
And if anyone's insane,
it's you.

789
00:29:56,129 --> 00:29:57,797
Because you're the one
turning down a chance

790
00:29:57,881 --> 00:29:59,132
to get out of that place.

791
00:29:59,215 --> 00:30:01,009
But we don't have time
to talk about that right now.

792
00:30:01,092 --> 00:30:02,135
Cahill's waiting for us.

793
00:30:02,218 --> 00:30:03,720
You got me out
to see Cahill?

794
00:30:03,803 --> 00:30:04,971
I said he's waiting.

795
00:30:05,054 --> 00:30:06,473
I didn't say that's
where I'm taking you.

796
00:30:06,556 --> 00:30:08,558
Well, then, where the hell
are you taking me?

797
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:25,658
You think me spending
a couple of hours with Rachel

798
00:30:25,742 --> 00:30:27,327
is going
to change my mind?

799
00:30:27,410 --> 00:30:30,079
If it doesn't,
there's something
wrong with you.

800
00:30:31,164 --> 00:30:33,041
So, are you going
to yell at me

801
00:30:33,124 --> 00:30:34,876
or are you going to take
the only chance
you're going to get

802
00:30:34,959 --> 00:30:36,211
to be alone
with the woman you love

803
00:30:36,294 --> 00:30:37,670
for the next two years?

804
00:30:38,922 --> 00:30:41,841
Please tell me
that you did not tell her
about Cahill's offer.

805
00:30:41,925 --> 00:30:43,593
HARVEY: Oh, I wanted to.

806
00:30:44,052 --> 00:30:46,763
But you have Donna to thank
for the fact that I didn't.

807
00:30:51,434 --> 00:30:54,062
What am I supposed
to tell Rachel about
why I'm here?

808
00:30:56,147 --> 00:30:58,483
If it were me,
I'd tell her the truth.

809
00:30:58,566 --> 00:31:00,818
Now, since you
don't want to do that...

810
00:31:02,278 --> 00:31:04,405
You're lucky
I came up with something else.

811
00:31:10,078 --> 00:31:12,205
Wait till it hits 30
and then sell it.

812
00:31:14,082 --> 00:31:15,458
Well, look who it is.

813
00:31:15,625 --> 00:31:17,710
You change your mind
about my offer?

814
00:31:17,794 --> 00:31:18,920
I'm not there just yet.

815
00:31:19,003 --> 00:31:20,797
But I did come to apologize.

816
00:31:20,922 --> 00:31:22,715
I didn't mean
to be so combative before.

817
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:25,260
You're a proud woman.
I understand. Bygones.

818
00:31:25,635 --> 00:31:28,137
You know, your operation here
is kind of impressive.

819
00:31:28,221 --> 00:31:29,639
You mind if I, uh,
look at one?

820
00:31:29,722 --> 00:31:31,224
You can take
a look at anything
of mine you want.

821
00:31:31,307 --> 00:31:32,308
(CHUCKLES)

822
00:31:34,727 --> 00:31:36,563
Huh. Now, what does

823
00:31:36,646 --> 00:31:38,022
that line right there mean?

824
00:31:39,107 --> 00:31:40,942
What the hell? That's my
Neubacher Capital position.

825
00:31:41,025 --> 00:31:42,402
Well, it seems
to be falling
very quickly.

826
00:31:42,485 --> 00:31:43,820
Is that a good thing?

827
00:31:45,113 --> 00:31:46,072
You did this.

828
00:31:46,155 --> 00:31:47,323
I'm not sure what you mean.

829
00:31:47,407 --> 00:31:50,243
All I did this afternoon
was call my friend
at Jacobson Kearney

830
00:31:50,326 --> 00:31:52,036
and have them issue
a press release about their

831
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,580
client's merger negotiations.

832
00:31:53,663 --> 00:31:55,331
I mean, how was I supposed
to know that it would make

833
00:31:55,415 --> 00:31:57,917
your Neubacher position
fall through the floor?

834
00:31:58,001 --> 00:31:59,877
You used the information
I gave you yesterday

835
00:31:59,961 --> 00:32:01,504
about my holdings,
that's how.

836
00:32:01,796 --> 00:32:03,506
That's inside information
and I can prove it.

837
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:05,758
No, it could have been
if your attorney hadn't

838
00:32:05,842 --> 00:32:07,260
filed your position
with the SEC

839
00:32:07,343 --> 00:32:09,304
10 days earlier
than he had to.

840
00:32:09,387 --> 00:32:10,638
I'm not going to forget this.

841
00:32:10,722 --> 00:32:12,765
Good. Because my operation's
been around a hell

842
00:32:12,849 --> 00:32:13,933
of a lot longer than yours.

843
00:32:14,017 --> 00:32:16,603
And we can be friends
or we can be enemies.

844
00:32:17,145 --> 00:32:19,439
But you mess with me again
and I'll not only
kick you out

845
00:32:19,522 --> 00:32:22,150
of these offices,
I'll put you in the ground.

846
00:32:35,663 --> 00:32:36,664
Rachel.

847
00:32:37,123 --> 00:32:39,125
Oh, my God.

848
00:32:45,715 --> 00:32:47,008
How?

849
00:32:47,342 --> 00:32:48,509
Harvey.

850
00:32:50,053 --> 00:32:52,055
Oh. I don't understand.

851
00:32:52,347 --> 00:32:54,098
I know you know
about Frank Gallo.

852
00:32:54,182 --> 00:32:56,309
But what you don't know
is that they put me

853
00:32:56,392 --> 00:32:58,561
in solitary confinement
for 36 hours.

854
00:32:58,645 --> 00:32:59,646
Oh, my God.

855
00:32:59,729 --> 00:33:01,064
It's okay. I was safe.

856
00:33:01,898 --> 00:33:03,650
Then Harvey made them watch
the video, which showed

857
00:33:03,733 --> 00:33:05,360
that I was only
defending myself.

858
00:33:05,443 --> 00:33:07,612
Turns out they were more
than happy to trade six hours

859
00:33:07,695 --> 00:33:10,740
and an ankle bracelet
to avoid a lawsuit.

860
00:33:12,659 --> 00:33:14,702
We only have six hours?

861
00:33:15,370 --> 00:33:18,081
Yeah. And I don't want
to waste any of it.

862
00:33:42,939 --> 00:33:44,023
Mr. Litt. What are you...

863
00:33:44,107 --> 00:33:45,858
Oh, please, call me Louis.

864
00:33:46,484 --> 00:33:47,944
What can
I do for you, Louis?

865
00:33:48,027 --> 00:33:49,278
Tara, I'm afraid
I have some bad news.

866
00:33:49,362 --> 00:33:50,571
We're not going
to be moving forward

867
00:33:50,655 --> 00:33:52,115
with the renovations
after all.

868
00:33:53,324 --> 00:33:54,450
I'm sorry to hear that.

869
00:33:54,534 --> 00:33:56,119
No, it has nothing
to do with you.

870
00:33:56,202 --> 00:33:58,246
And of course I will
pay you out of my own pocket

871
00:33:58,329 --> 00:33:59,539
for any of the work
you've already done.

872
00:33:59,622 --> 00:34:00,790
That won't be necessary.

873
00:34:00,873 --> 00:34:02,250
Please, Tara, I insist.

874
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:05,878
In that case,
I might as well

875
00:34:05,962 --> 00:34:07,588
at least show you
what I had in mind.

876
00:34:10,425 --> 00:34:13,094
As you can see,
these are just
rough drawings.

877
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:15,096
Not to me.

878
00:34:15,179 --> 00:34:18,725
Here's the frosted glass wall
curving in an elegant "S"

879
00:34:18,808 --> 00:34:20,435
that separates the space.

880
00:34:21,185 --> 00:34:23,813
It's beautiful.
That's not even
the best part.

881
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:27,108
Because I know how important
the new bullpen is to you,

882
00:34:27,191 --> 00:34:29,569
I modeled it after
the Kimmel Center

883
00:34:29,652 --> 00:34:31,904
in Philadelphia,
and I enclosed
the entire space.

884
00:34:31,988 --> 00:34:32,989
In mahogany.

885
00:34:33,656 --> 00:34:34,949
(EXHALES)

886
00:34:35,032 --> 00:34:36,743
It would
have been exquisite.

887
00:34:36,826 --> 00:34:39,620
But some things
weren't meant to be.

888
00:34:40,955 --> 00:34:41,956
Yeah.

889
00:34:43,541 --> 00:34:44,751
How would you feel
about renovating

890
00:34:44,834 --> 00:34:46,043
my summer house
in the Hamptons?

891
00:34:46,127 --> 00:34:47,462
I appreciate
the thought, Louis,

892
00:34:47,545 --> 00:34:48,671
but I don't do
residential work.

893
00:34:48,755 --> 00:34:51,007
It's not residential.
I use it as a home office.

894
00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:52,592
But it would be so small.

895
00:34:52,675 --> 00:34:53,718
Oh, no,
I want the entire house

896
00:34:53,801 --> 00:34:55,303
to be a satellite
division of the firm.

897
00:34:56,471 --> 00:34:57,472
Are you sure?

898
00:34:58,431 --> 00:35:00,349
I've never been as sure
of anything in my entire life.

899
00:35:03,394 --> 00:35:05,772
Then I look forward
to working with you, Louis.

900
00:35:12,695 --> 00:35:14,906
Sean, what can I do for you?
Where the hell are they?

901
00:35:15,031 --> 00:35:16,407
What?
I've been sitting
in my office

902
00:35:16,491 --> 00:35:17,617
for two hours
waiting for them.

903
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:19,535
Where the hell are they?
I don't know.

904
00:35:19,619 --> 00:35:20,661
Maybe they're
caught in traffic.

905
00:35:20,745 --> 00:35:21,913
Listen to me.
I can contact the prison

906
00:35:21,996 --> 00:35:23,456
and find out exactly
where they are.

907
00:35:23,539 --> 00:35:25,082
But I do that,
it starts a tornado

908
00:35:25,166 --> 00:35:26,751
of shit with your boss
in the eye of the storm.

909
00:35:26,834 --> 00:35:27,960
So, you're going
to tell me right now

910
00:35:28,044 --> 00:35:29,253
what the hell they're up to.

911
00:35:30,296 --> 00:35:32,256
He's waiting for Mike
outside of his apartment.

912
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:33,800
Waiting for him to do what?
He's with Rachel.

913
00:35:33,883 --> 00:35:36,219
You've got to be kidding me.
I didn't pull in every favor
I have

914
00:35:36,302 --> 00:35:38,012
so Mike Ross
could have some
conjugal visit.

915
00:35:38,095 --> 00:35:40,056
No, you pulled in every favor
you had so that Harvey

916
00:35:40,139 --> 00:35:41,933
could convince Mike
to do what you wanted.

917
00:35:42,016 --> 00:35:43,601
And this is going
to make that happen.

918
00:35:43,684 --> 00:35:44,811
By getting him laid?

919
00:35:44,894 --> 00:35:46,229
By reminding him
of what he's missing out on

920
00:35:46,312 --> 00:35:47,438
if he doesn't
take your deal.

921
00:35:47,522 --> 00:35:48,856
That wasn't the plan.

922
00:35:50,233 --> 00:35:51,943
Where are you going?
I'm going to go down there

923
00:35:52,026 --> 00:35:53,194
and do what we said
we were going to do.

924
00:35:53,277 --> 00:35:54,779
I'm going to show Mike
the innocent people

925
00:35:54,862 --> 00:35:55,988
that lost everything
because of that bastard.

926
00:35:56,072 --> 00:35:57,156
Sean, please.

927
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:59,283
If you do that,
Rachel will find out
about everything

928
00:35:59,367 --> 00:36:00,409
and that can't happen.

929
00:36:00,493 --> 00:36:01,494
Why not?

930
00:36:01,577 --> 00:36:02,995
Because Mike chose prison
over her once.

931
00:36:03,079 --> 00:36:04,664
And if he does it again,
she'll never forgive him.

932
00:36:04,747 --> 00:36:06,457
Mike's problem, not mine.

933
00:36:06,541 --> 00:36:08,584
No, that's Harvey's problem.

934
00:36:08,668 --> 00:36:10,378
He promised Mike
he wouldn't tell her,

935
00:36:10,461 --> 00:36:12,088
and Harvey's
a man of his word.

936
00:36:12,171 --> 00:36:14,298
If he were a man of his word,
he would be here right now.

937
00:36:14,382 --> 00:36:15,967
So, what are you going to do?
I'm going to do what should

938
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:17,301
have been done
in the first place.

939
00:36:17,385 --> 00:36:18,761
I'm going to tell
Mike's fiancÃ©e

940
00:36:18,845 --> 00:36:20,012
that he has
a chance to get out

941
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:21,472
but he doesn't want
to take it.

942
00:36:23,432 --> 00:36:25,601
You want to tell me
what that was all about?

943
00:36:28,271 --> 00:36:30,273
Harvey and Cahill got Mike
out of prison to convince him

944
00:36:30,356 --> 00:36:31,482
to take the deal.

945
00:36:32,108 --> 00:36:34,861
And Harvey brought Mike
to Rachel instead of to Sean.

946
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:37,154
He broke Mike
out of prison.

947
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:40,032
Is he crazy?
It sounded crazy
to me at first, too.

948
00:36:40,116 --> 00:36:41,909
But Harvey's living
with the guilt
of putting Mike

949
00:36:41,993 --> 00:36:43,703
in there and Cahill
was willing to do it.

950
00:36:43,786 --> 00:36:44,829
So, can you blame him?

951
00:36:45,705 --> 00:36:47,623
No, I can't.

952
00:36:49,917 --> 00:36:51,878
But I want to know how
this whole thing shakes out.

953
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:53,671
And I want to know tonight.

954
00:37:08,394 --> 00:37:09,645
(GASPS)
Shh.

955
00:37:09,812 --> 00:37:11,397
What time is it?
We still have time.

956
00:37:12,899 --> 00:37:14,025
Oh, my God.

957
00:37:15,067 --> 00:37:16,527
Oh, I fell asleep.

958
00:37:17,862 --> 00:37:18,863
You did.

959
00:37:19,322 --> 00:37:21,157
Why didn't you wake me?

960
00:37:21,824 --> 00:37:23,409
Because you looked
so peaceful.

961
00:37:23,492 --> 00:37:24,577
Rachel, come on.

962
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:25,786
I don't want us
to waste any...

963
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:27,079
We're not wasting anything.

964
00:37:27,163 --> 00:37:29,332
Mike, I don't know
how well you sleep in there.

965
00:37:30,166 --> 00:37:32,501
So, to be able
to give you this...

966
00:37:38,925 --> 00:37:39,926
Thank you.

967
00:37:42,219 --> 00:37:44,096
Can I cook you something?

968
00:37:45,097 --> 00:37:46,682
I'll make you
anything you want.

969
00:37:46,766 --> 00:37:49,352
No, I just
want us to lie here
and stare at each other

970
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:53,230
and not say anything.

971
00:37:56,901 --> 00:37:57,902
Oh, God.

972
00:37:59,528 --> 00:38:01,614
You're so beautiful.

973
00:38:04,617 --> 00:38:06,827
I thought
you wanted us to be quiet.

974
00:38:07,244 --> 00:38:08,913
Well, I couldn't help it.

975
00:38:08,996 --> 00:38:10,998
You know, you always tell me
how beautiful I am.

976
00:38:11,082 --> 00:38:13,668
You never give me a chance
to tell you how handsome
I think you are.

977
00:38:13,751 --> 00:38:15,211
I thought you loved me
for my mind.

978
00:38:15,294 --> 00:38:16,462
I do.

979
00:38:16,587 --> 00:38:18,631
But that doesn't mean
that I don't also think

980
00:38:18,714 --> 00:38:19,966
you're handsome.

981
00:38:27,890 --> 00:38:29,392
Mike, what's going on?

982
00:38:30,434 --> 00:38:32,436
There's something
I need to tell you.

983
00:38:32,853 --> 00:38:33,980
Does it have something

984
00:38:34,063 --> 00:38:35,898
to do with why
you're really here?

985
00:38:37,316 --> 00:38:39,235
Because I didn't believe
what you told me earlier.

986
00:38:40,111 --> 00:38:41,737
Why didn't
you say something?

987
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:44,031
Because you're here.

988
00:38:45,449 --> 00:38:46,742
So, I didn't care.

989
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:02,508
What's that?
I'm unwinding

990
00:39:02,591 --> 00:39:03,926
my position
with Nathan Byrnes' company.

991
00:39:04,010 --> 00:39:05,511
Well, I appreciate that.
But I don't need

992
00:39:05,594 --> 00:39:06,762
to take home
the paper trail.

993
00:39:06,846 --> 00:39:08,097
It's not a paper trail.

994
00:39:08,597 --> 00:39:09,807
It's an engagement letter.

995
00:39:10,016 --> 00:39:11,684
Turns out my attorney
was filing my positions

996
00:39:11,767 --> 00:39:13,477
before he had to,
so I let him go.

997
00:39:13,853 --> 00:39:15,688
You want me
to take you as a client.

998
00:39:15,771 --> 00:39:17,565
If you'll have me.
On one condition.

999
00:39:17,648 --> 00:39:19,734
I hear
you've been having fun
with Louis Litt.

1000
00:39:20,609 --> 00:39:22,528
But it stops now.

1001
00:39:23,279 --> 00:39:24,321
Done.

1002
00:39:38,794 --> 00:39:40,463
I should have known a guy
who would hire a fraud

1003
00:39:40,546 --> 00:39:42,298
like that would pull
a stunt like this.

1004
00:39:42,381 --> 00:39:45,009
This stunt
is going to get you
exactly what you want.

1005
00:39:45,217 --> 00:39:46,969
No, Harvey.
I'm going to get what I want

1006
00:39:47,053 --> 00:39:48,179
by telling
that kid's fiancÃ©e

1007
00:39:48,262 --> 00:39:49,722
the truth and letting her
do the work for me.

1008
00:39:49,805 --> 00:39:52,141
Listen to me, Sean.
She doesn't know

1009
00:39:52,224 --> 00:39:53,350
because he doesn't
want her to know.

1010
00:39:53,434 --> 00:39:54,685
I don't give
a shit what he wants.

1011
00:39:54,769 --> 00:39:57,146
Then trust me.
This is the only way
to get what you want.

1012
00:39:57,229 --> 00:39:58,731
Trust you?
You lied to my face.

1013
00:39:58,814 --> 00:40:00,357
I made a judgment call.

1014
00:40:00,441 --> 00:40:01,859
Then look me in the eye
and tell me you didn't make

1015
00:40:01,942 --> 00:40:03,819
that call
before you asked me
to get him out.

1016
00:40:03,986 --> 00:40:04,987
I knew it.

1017
00:40:05,404 --> 00:40:07,198
The whole time,
you were always going
to bring him here.

1018
00:40:07,281 --> 00:40:08,699
Because this
is the way to get it done.

1019
00:40:08,783 --> 00:40:10,326
Then why didn't you tell me
that in the first place?

1020
00:40:10,409 --> 00:40:11,577
Because it would have
ended up

1021
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:12,870
with you wanting
to use Rachel.

1022
00:40:12,953 --> 00:40:14,914
It ended there anyway. Now,
get the hell out of my way.

1023
00:40:14,997 --> 00:40:16,290
Don't make me
stop you, Sean.

1024
00:40:16,373 --> 00:40:18,334
Are you threatening
a federal prosecutor, Harvey?

1025
00:40:18,417 --> 00:40:20,211
You're goddamn right I am.
Well, you better think

1026
00:40:20,294 --> 00:40:21,921
about this move more than you
thought about the last one.

1027
00:40:22,004 --> 00:40:23,297
Because it's not going
to end well for you.

1028
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:25,841
As far as I'm concerned,
it's the same move.

1029
00:40:25,925 --> 00:40:28,677
I made a promise
and I'm not going
to break it.

1030
00:40:29,845 --> 00:40:30,846
MIKE: Harvey.

1031
00:40:32,515 --> 00:40:34,850
Whatever you're
fighting about, you can stop.

1032
00:40:35,226 --> 00:40:36,685
I told Rachel everything.

1033
00:40:38,521 --> 00:40:39,814
I'm taking the deal.

1034
00:40:42,316 --> 00:40:44,401
Then let's get in the car
and get moving.

1035
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:26,325
