1
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:19,852
Hey.

2
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:21,595
Hey.

3
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:23,308
Wouldn't a chainsaw be easier?

4
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:26,820
Yeah, but not as much fun.

5
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:31,283
How are you?

6
00:00:31,364 --> 00:00:32,364
I'm all right.

7
00:00:33,992 --> 00:00:35,792
I was just coming
to see how you were doing.

8
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:37,656
Yeah. I'm good.

9
00:00:38,788 --> 00:00:39,828
Why you asking?

10
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:42,214
Just curious.

11
00:00:45,253 --> 00:00:48,093
Since we're being curious,
where have you been the last few days?

12
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:49,763
Doc gave me a few days off,

13
00:00:49,841 --> 00:00:52,051
so I could recover
from the whole pot thing.

14
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:54,353
How you doin' with that?

15
00:00:57,098 --> 00:00:59,228
I'd kind of rather just forget
it ever happened.

16
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:02,766
Yeah, well,
some things are better left alone.

17
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:07,025
But I think if...

18
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:11,573
they're causing physical distress,
then it's unhealthy not to talk about it.

19
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:14,663
Somethin' you tryin' to tell me?

20
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:19,843
I don't know about you,
but I've been having a hard time sleeping.

21
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:21,001
Look...

22
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:23,750
you don't have to worry.

23
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:25,837
Doc and I paid Calvin a visit.

24
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:29,049
He knows to keep his distance from you,
or he's gonna have to deal with me.

25
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:31,380
Thank you.

26
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:32,925
Yeah.

27
00:01:34,552 --> 00:01:36,142
But how have you been sleeping?

28
00:01:38,306 --> 00:01:39,306
Same as usual.

29
00:01:41,559 --> 00:01:42,729
Um...

30
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:45,308
The night we got back,

31
00:01:45,396 --> 00:01:48,816
and you stayed over
so I could fall asleep...

32
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:50,943
Yeah.

33
00:01:52,403 --> 00:01:54,573
...I think you were having a night terror.

34
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:55,906
Night terror?

35
00:01:56,908 --> 00:01:59,988
Yeah. You were thrashing around,
and yelling, and...

36
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:04,325
Anyhow, I think I'd remember that.

37
00:02:04,415 --> 00:02:08,285
Unlike a nightmare,
people sleep through night terrors.

38
00:02:08,586 --> 00:02:09,416
Mel...

39
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:13,054
They're really not that uncommon
for vets who've been in combat.

40
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:15,133
Yeah, not this vet.
But thank you for your concern.

41
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:18,046
It's nothing to be ashamed of, Jack.
I... Honestly... It...

42
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:20,468
Ah, there you are. Hello, Mel.

43
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:22,057
Jack, I need your help.

44
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:24,312
Preacher's doing a roasted pig
for the Mingle,

45
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:26,104
but we've always done honey-baked hams.

46
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:28,648
Do you know how long it takes
to roast a pig?

47
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:31,691
If it's not ready in time,
we'll have a mutiny on our hands.

48
00:02:31,776 --> 00:02:34,547
- What do you want me to do about it?
- Talk to him. He'll listen to you.

49
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:36,799
I know better than
to get between Preacher and his grill.

50
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:38,023
Oh, you have one heart attack,

51
00:02:38,074 --> 00:02:39,634
everything goes to hell
in a handbasket.

52
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:41,789
And why haven't you RSVP'd?

53
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,190
I know you think we're backwoods,

54
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:46,416
but folks around here consider it rude
to ignore an invitation.

55
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:48,999
I... I'm sorry,
I don't know what you're talking about.

56
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:52,335
Tonight is Virgin River's
annual Moonlight Mingle.

57
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:53,512
Still lost.

58
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:56,510
The Moonlight Mingle
is the premier social event

59
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:57,893
on the Virgin River calendar.

60
00:02:57,969 --> 00:03:01,929
Every year, the entire town gets together
at one of our resident farms

61
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:03,555
for dinner and dancing.

62
00:03:04,058 --> 00:03:06,808
When you least expect it,
the DJ shouts "Mingle,"

63
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:09,265
and all dancers
have to switch partners.

64
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:13,025
- So, it's kind of like a square dance.
- No! It's not like square dancing.

65
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:14,739
This is a semi-formal event.

66
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:16,259
Yeah. It's actually kind of elegant.

67
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:20,912
Okay. Well, thank you very much,
but I'm gonna have to pass.

68
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:21,992
You can't pass.

69
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:24,580
That would be considered
highly unsociable.

70
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:26,541
- By who?
- Me.

71
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:28,036
And the entire town.

72
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,500
I'm not much of a dancer.

73
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:31,825
That's a lie.

74
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:34,379
Hey, sis.

75
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:35,756
Joey.

76
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:54,112
I'll get you guys a coffee.

77
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:56,534
- Oh, no thanks. I'm okay.
- Yeah, that'd be great.

78
00:03:57,487 --> 00:04:00,817
Wow, this place is really committed
to the dead animal motif, huh?

79
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:04,287
- Well, every one tells a story.
- With a very upsetting ending.

80
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:06,289
Hey, I just work here.

81
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:08,369
No, Jack owns the bar.

82
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:10,165
Oh, that Jack.

83
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:11,917
Now I get it.

84
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:13,415
Get what?

85
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:14,673
Nothing.

86
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:20,591
- Thank you.
- Any time.

87
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,390
Hey, Ricky.

88
00:04:23,721 --> 00:04:25,851
Come over here
and meet Mel's sister, Joey.

89
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:29,643
Hi, ma'am.

90
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:31,556
He called me ma'am.

91
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:33,146
How cute is that?

92
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:39,030
You're all my witness. Preacher swears
the pig will be ready by six.

93
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:40,282
And it will.

94
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:41,363
So, Joey...

95
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:43,565
what brings you to town?

96
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:47,162
I wanted to see the place
that has so captivated my little sister.

97
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:51,788
Well, if you need anything
while you're here, ask Jack.

98
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:54,424
Mel, I'll see you at the Mingle.

99
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:56,554
Feel free to bring your sister.

100
00:04:58,214 --> 00:04:59,304
What's a "Mingle"?

101
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:00,432
Don't ask.

102
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:04,351
Come on. I'll show you around town
before I have to go to work.

103
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:05,429
- Okay.
- Okay.

104
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:09,314
If you'd given me a little notice,
I could have rearranged my schedule.

105
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:12,512
If I'd given you a little notice, then my
visit would not have been a surprise.

106
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:13,772
Hey, hey, hey, leave that.

107
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,605
We'll get that over
to the Fitches' for you.

108
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:17,345
- Thanks.
- I'll take care of it.

109
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,490
- Thank you.
- Yeah. Any time.

110
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:23,656
- See you later.
- Yeah.

111
00:05:32,915 --> 00:05:34,995
Okay. Truth. What are you doing here?

112
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:37,210
Are you kidding?

113
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:40,170
You were just held up at gunpoint
by drug dealers.

114
00:05:40,256 --> 00:05:42,086
They weren't dealers, they were growers.

115
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:43,375
And how is that better?

116
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:45,888
Like I told you, I am fine.

117
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:48,224
Well, I had to see for myself.

118
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:51,059
You look lovely.

119
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:53,602
What about Bill and the kids?
It's your birthday tomorrow?

120
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:55,806
Well, this was his present to me.

121
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:58,517
Three days, no kids,
and no responsibilities.

122
00:06:00,985 --> 00:06:02,825
What is the matter?
Aren't you happy to see me?

123
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:03,914
I am happy to see you.

124
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:08,698
I just find it really odd that you chose
to have your birthday in Virgin River.

125
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:11,664
I chose to spend my birthday with you.

126
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:14,790
Okay?

127
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:28,136
Hi.

128
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:29,721
Hey.

129
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:33,306
Well... the attorney
can meet with us this afternoon.

130
00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:35,226
The Mingle is tonight.

131
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:37,524
Uh... there are a dozen loose ends.

132
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:40,225
No way I can take time out
to meet with an attorney today.

133
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:43,896
He is going on vacation.
He can meet us today or a month from now.

134
00:06:43,986 --> 00:06:45,906
Who takes a month-long vacation?

135
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:47,778
Do you want the appointment or not?

136
00:06:47,865 --> 00:06:48,695
Fine.

137
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:50,283
But we need to keep it short.

138
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:53,248
Yeah, well, believe me,
I want this over as quickly as possible.

139
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:56,575
Hey, did you hear?
Mel's sister came to town.

140
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:58,536
No, and why would I care?

141
00:06:58,626 --> 00:07:01,166
I hope she's not gonna
try to talk Mel into leaving.

142
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:03,719
I would tell you
to stay out of Mel's business,

143
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:07,886
but that'd be like... like telling a bull
to ignore the color red.

144
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:10,509
So, in this scenario, I'm the bull?

145
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:12,389
If the horns fit.

146
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:16,853
Oh, um... bring your checkbook
to that meeting with the attorney.

147
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:18,267
For what?

148
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:21,074
Well, because executing divorce papers
isn't cheap.

149
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:22,429
It'll be a few thousand dollars.

150
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:25,703
Are you suggesting we go halfsies
on our divorce?

151
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:28,658
I don't see why we wouldn't.
Divorce wasn't my idea.

152
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:32,699
- I don't have that kind of money.
- Oh, woman, you lie like a rug.

153
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:36,745
Fine. I'll pay my share,
but you should be ashamed of yourself.

154
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:39,711
It was your indiscretion
that caused all this,

155
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:41,462
so it should be you who pays the price.

156
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:02,015
This is nice.

157
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:04,649
A roll-away.

158
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:06,693
How quaint.

159
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:08,783
- Well, they were fully booked...
- Oh.

160
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:11,493
...which can happen
when you show up unannounced.

161
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:12,866
I know.

162
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:15,897
I think we should share your bed.

163
00:08:15,953 --> 00:08:19,293
Uh... okay, we haven't done that
since we were kids.

164
00:08:19,373 --> 00:08:20,833
I know. It'll be fun.

165
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:22,167
What are you doing?

166
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:24,378
What do you think
the thread count is here?

167
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:26,262
'Cause I'm guessing it's 250, tops.

168
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:30,256
Oh, come on. Don't be a snob.
The Fitches have been very gracious to me.

169
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:31,783
Oh, grace has nothing to do with it.

170
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:35,974
I'm allergic to non-organic fibers.
Fortunately, I brought my own sheets.

171
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:39,846
You always think of everything.

172
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:41,726
Hah! Bill would disagree.

173
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:46,653
According to him,
I have no idea how the real world works.

174
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:49,239
He said that to you?

175
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:51,945
You know what?
I don't wanna talk about Bill.

176
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,740
I wanna know what's going on with you.

177
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:58,082
How's the baby doing? Chloe?

178
00:08:58,162 --> 00:09:00,122
Oh, I just went and saw her, actually.

179
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:03,626
She's doing good.
She's finally at a healthy weight.

180
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:05,633
She's so adorable.

181
00:09:10,424 --> 00:09:12,104
Must have been really hard to give her up.

182
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:15,096
I didn't give her up.
I reunited her with her mother.

183
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:16,972
Still.

184
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:20,388
Why don't we talk about your birthday?

185
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:23,727
I heard that there's a decent spa
in Eureka.

186
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:26,773
Yeah, you know what? I don't really wanna
do anything for my birthday.

187
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:29,527
Okay, so you came here
to celebrate your birthday,

188
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:31,450
but you don't want
to celebrate your birthday.

189
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:34,239
- Got it.
- I don't want to make a big deal of it.

190
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:36,083
What are you even talking about?

191
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:37,738
You always wanna do something big.

192
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:39,997
I mean, last year,
you and Bill went to Tahiti.

193
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:43,370
Well, this year,
I just feel like being more low-key.

194
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:45,878
You didn't come here
to celebrate anything.

195
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:49,923
You came here
to convince me to leave.

196
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:51,876
That's not true.

197
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:56,184
It's not. I do think that coming home
would be the best thing for you.

198
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:59,102
Look, I told you
that no matter what happens here,

199
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:02,232
I'm not coming back to LA, okay?

200
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:07,357
And have you ever even considered
that me starting over somewhere

201
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,900
might be the best thing for me?

202
00:10:09,483 --> 00:10:10,823
Except you're not starting over.

203
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:13,895
- You're living in denial.
- Really?

204
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:16,908
I mean, you still have
your wedding ring on, for God's sakes.

205
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:20,831
You know, just because
I'm having trouble letting go

206
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:22,291
doesn't mean that I'm in denial.

207
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:27,039
Okay? I came here
so that I could help people.

208
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:31,838
And I'm staying here for the moment
because I made a commitment.

209
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:33,421
You made a mistake.

210
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:36,194
The sooner you realize that,
the better off you'll be.

211
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:38,718
- Oh, my God. You don't get it.
- Yes, I do.

212
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:40,514
I know exactly what you're doing.

213
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:43,268
No, you don't. You haven't for years.

214
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:47,651
Because life is more to me
than a Barneys mid-year sale.

215
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:52,030
Okay, look. I may not be as smart
and successful as you are,

216
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:56,485
but at least I'm honest
about who I am and what I want.

217
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:01,951
- Mel...
- No, I can't.

218
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:11,375
♪ You don't really care ♪

219
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:15,840
What can I get you?

220
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:19,388
How about an entire bottle of gin?

221
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:21,890
Uh-oh. How about an iced tea?

222
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:23,892
- Ugh... fine.
- Everything okay?

223
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:27,654
No. My sister's been here for five minutes
and we're already fighting.

224
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:30,608
You know, I got a friend, he has
brothers. They fought all the time.

225
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:34,190
But then as soon as one hit the other one,
bam, it's all over.

226
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,580
So, what are you saying?
I should punch her?

227
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:38,215
- It worked for the Hill brothers.
- Great.

228
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:39,949
Come on. Just apologize.

229
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:41,698
Enjoy her visit.

230
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:45,834
- She'll be gone before you know it.
- You're right. You're right.

231
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:48,287
I know she loves me so much,

232
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:50,634
but she just can't wrap her head around
why I'm here.

233
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:53,214
Yeah, well, I get that.

234
00:11:53,587 --> 00:11:56,257
Yeah, my family thought I was crazy
when I moved here.

235
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:58,723
I guess it was a little unexpected,

236
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:01,851
but I didn't fit in when I went home
after Iraq.

237
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:02,929
I just...

238
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:05,472
You know what, in the end,

239
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:09,186
what I realized was that I needed
to make a new home for myself.

240
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:12,436
Right.
That's exactly what I'm trying to do,

241
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:14,862
but she still wants me to move back to LA.

242
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:20,738
I don't know. Maybe she's right.
Maybe I should just go back.

243
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:23,833
Well, I didn't, uh...

244
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:26,921
I didn't realize
that was still on the table.

245
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:30,617
My trial period with Doc
is almost up, and...

246
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:33,770
at some point I have to decide
whether or not I'm going to stay here

247
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:35,004
for the rest of the year.

248
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:37,967
Well, you know,
the pull of family is strong.

249
00:12:38,632 --> 00:12:40,112
Especially when you're feeling alone.

250
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:42,761
Exactly.

251
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:46,102
You know, there's real value
in being independent.

252
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:50,851
I am independent.

253
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:54,318
I know. Otherwise, you wouldn't be here.

254
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:59,066
Well, regardless,
I need to go apologize to my sister.

255
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:04,198
Well, the view's always better
from the high road.

256
00:13:05,701 --> 00:13:06,701
Yes, it is.

257
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:17,841
Wow, did Hope order all of this?

258
00:13:18,422 --> 00:13:21,222
Yeah.
I guess she's expecting quite the turnout.

259
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,180
Yeah.

260
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:24,429
She ordered enough pecan pie
to feed an army.

261
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:25,552
Well, unfortunately,

262
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:27,398
I'll be more than happy
to eat the leftovers.

263
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:29,811
I have a weakness
for anything pecan related.

264
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:32,598
I think I get it from my dad.

265
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,980
He grew up on a pecan farm in Texas.

266
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:39,280
I thought your father grew up
in the northeast.

267
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:40,777
No...

268
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:44,987
uh... but he did move to upstate New York
in high school.

269
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:47,791
So, are you, uh... going tonight?

270
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:50,249
Yeah, I promised Hope that I would.

271
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:55,253
If you, uh... if you want, you know,
we could drive out together.

272
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:56,835
Oh. Um...

273
00:13:57,211 --> 00:14:01,721
I... I would, but I have some things
I need to take care of up in Clear River,

274
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:03,839
so I was just gonna drive straight
from there.

275
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:05,635
Yeah.

276
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:07,845
Yeah, that's, uh...
that's smart.

277
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:10,927
- I'll see you tonight, kiddo.
- Bye, Preacher.

278
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:13,479
- Okay. See ya.
- Thanks.

279
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:19,357
What stuff?

280
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:21,403
What stuff are we doing in Clear River?

281
00:14:21,485 --> 00:14:23,525
Nothing.
I just said that to make things easier.

282
00:14:23,612 --> 00:14:24,822
So, you lied?

283
00:14:25,739 --> 00:14:27,659
I don't want to hurt Preacher's feelings.

284
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,120
And you shouldn't be eavesdropping,
anyway.

285
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:32,203
How else am I gonna find out stuff?

286
00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:56,519
Hey, remind me how I got roped into this?

287
00:14:56,854 --> 00:14:58,894
You can go back
to working at the bar with Preacher.

288
00:14:58,939 --> 00:15:00,069
Uh...

289
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:02,896
Copy that.

290
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:07,570
Guys, I'd really like to hand the keys
over by the end of the week.

291
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:08,816
Well, what's the big rush?

292
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:10,968
I just think it should be done by then.

293
00:15:11,535 --> 00:15:13,365
Oh, uh... okay.

294
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:15,833
Hey, baby.

295
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:18,499
Hey.

296
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:20,624
What are you doing here?
I thought you'd be at work.

297
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:23,669
Well, I had a little bit of a gap
in my schedule,

298
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:25,356
so I thought I'd come and give you this.

299
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:29,432
Hm. Preacher told me where to find you.

300
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:33,684
Wow, you've really transformed this place.

301
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,310
- Yeah, that's the plan.
- Hm.

302
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:40,614
Well, speaking of plans,
I need you to make a decision.

303
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:43,863
Dinner. Before or after the Mingle?

304
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:47,199
Oh, right. Yeah.

305
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:51,159
Uh, well, I guess we could grab somethin'
in Clear River beforehand.

306
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:52,951
Sounds like a plan.

307
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,877
Okay. Bye, boys.

308
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:08,722
- What?
- Nothin'.

309
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:11,195
Well, hey, if you got somethin' to say.

310
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:15,021
Nah. Just, uh, thinkin'. You got a lot
on your plate these days.

311
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,490
- Hey.
- Hey.

312
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:35,411
I thought you wanted to stay in.

313
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:36,754
I changed my mind.

314
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:39,579
- Joey.
- What? I want to go to that Mingle thing.

315
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,090
Look, I want to apologize
for what I said earlier.

316
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:45,503
I'm sorry too.

317
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:47,290
Now, can I borrow some shoes?

318
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:50,139
Because if this thing is at a farm,
I'm gonna need, like, a wedge heel.

319
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,675
Can we talk, please?

320
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,850
We both said things we didn't mean. Okay?

321
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:56,722
Let's just forget about it.
Go out, have some fun.

322
00:16:57,307 --> 00:17:00,017
- Really? You're not mad?
- No. I should not have said what I did.

323
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:03,982
- Okay.
- So get ready, 'cause I feel like dancing.

324
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:06,984
Well, I don't think the Mingle
is gonna live up to your expectations.

325
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:09,947
As long as there's a bar, I will be fine.
Okay?

326
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:15,704
Let's find something for you to wear
that doesn't involve boots.

327
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:27,246
♪ I know you'll always be here ♪

328
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:32,337
♪ You won me from the moment
I was in your atmosphere ♪

329
00:17:32,926 --> 00:17:35,296
♪ What chance did I have ♪

330
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:38,467
♪ When you looked up and said
You wouldn't be here? ♪

331
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:40,807
♪ Now, promise me here ♪

332
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:43,403
♪ You're ready to forgive me ♪

333
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:45,939
This is really something.

334
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:49,113
Ah, it looks like
the entire town showed up.

335
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:50,861
Is Lilly coming?

336
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:53,914
Oh, she's doing better,
but wasn't ready for a big event.

337
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:57,529
She's seeing a therapist up in Clear River
who's really helping her.

338
00:17:57,618 --> 00:18:00,368
When she told me about Chloe,
oh, I just said,

339
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:04,254
"Well, honey, I love you,
and the entire town is here for you."

340
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:06,423
Huh? It's what we do.

341
00:18:10,672 --> 00:18:12,882
Hope. What the hell?

342
00:18:12,966 --> 00:18:15,586

on this divorce,

344
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:19,969
- and you don't show up to the meeting?
- I got busy.

345
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:21,777
Preacher tried
to bait and switch the salad.

Lucky I intervened,
or you'd all be eating arugula.

00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:52,904
Sorry,
I'm not the, uh... best dancer.

- Neither am I. It's fine.

383
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:57,277
That is so sweet of you to lie to me.

384
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:04,788
So, how are you enjoying Virgin River?

385
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:08,038
Um... honestly?

386
00:20:08,123 --> 00:20:09,723
It's been a little bit of an adjustment.

387
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:10,750
Yeah.

388
00:20:10,834 --> 00:20:12,294

- Yeah.

389
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:13,377
Mm.

390
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:14,842
But Jack's been a big help...

391
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:16,052
- Yeah.
- ...so that's great.

392
00:20:16,131 --> 00:20:17,381
Yeah, he is a good man.

395

- Ten years.
- Ten years.

Yeah.

397
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:30,602
Wow. You must be really close.

398
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:32,063
We're brothers.

399
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:35,321
In fact, I swear I know him better
than he knows himself.

400
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:38,114
I can't imagine how hard it must've been.

401
00:20:39,529 --> 00:20:41,779
We were all there to... to do a job.

402
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:45,118
Jack was there
to make sure we all got home alive.

403
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:49,329
Sounds like a lot of pressure.

404
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:50,424
Yeah.

405
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:51,579
Oh, he handled it.

406
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:54,955
Do you think he's still handling it?

407
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:59,926
Yeah, I'm sure.
I mean, every now and then, he gets, uh...

408
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,760
a little wound up,
but that's just being human.

409
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:05,604
Has he ever had any help?

410
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:10,438
Well, Jack prefers to manage his business
on his own.

411
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:15,152
Yeah, but if it was a broken bone,
you'd get it set, right?

412
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:17,533
It's really no different.

Why didn't you just tell me

is none of your business.

Wow. I can't believe you just said that.

620

to run your life?

639
00:32:26,861 --> 00:32:29,201
you are never gonna get your life
back on track.

640
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:32,740

does not mean that my life isn't on track.

you know, a long time to heal.

And I've apologized.

Well... what is there to get?

653
00:33:10,863 --> 00:33:13,323
The reason Hope can't forgive you
is because...

654
00:33:15,368 --> 00:33:17,578
she believed that you were
the one person in the world

655
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:18,712
who wouldn't hurt her.

656
00:33:20,748 --> 00:33:22,708
After two crappy husbands,

657
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:26,131
you were supposed to be
her knight in shining armor.

00:33:26,212 --> 00:33:29,592

to drive off into the sunset with.

Yeah, but Hope, she doesn't... doesn't
believe in all that fairy tale crap.

660
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:35,385

665
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:50,990
this is my two cents.

666
00:33:51,612 --> 00:33:54,282

00:35:14,153 --> 00:35:15,153
Come on, buddy.

692
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:27,253
Okay, everybody, mingle.

693
00:35:36,676 --> 00:35:38,546
Oh, my!

694
00:35:40,429 --> 00:35:41,929
I feel dizzy.

695
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:44,484
You can spin me next time.

696
00:35:45,226 --> 00:35:46,806
Oh, Jack Sheridan.

697
00:35:47,061 --> 00:35:48,561
I can't thank you enough.

698
00:35:49,021 --> 00:35:50,151
For the dance?

699
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:52,231
No, for taking Ricky under your wing.

700
00:35:52,316 --> 00:35:54,486
Oh, come on. Your grandson is a great kid.

701
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:56,779
Well, he certainly idolizes you.

702
00:35:57,113 --> 00:36:00,073
Huh. I mean, he never had a real father.

703
00:36:01,909 --> 00:36:03,999
It's good he has you for a role model.

704
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:06,458
Boys need good men to help them grow up.

705
00:36:06,789 --> 00:36:07,789
Mm-hm.

706
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:13,713
When he came here after losing his mom
the way he did, it...

707
00:36:14,297 --> 00:36:15,587
He felt so alone.

708
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:18,550
Hey.

709
00:36:19,927 --> 00:36:24,307
Well, he has you, and he has me,
and he has Doc, and he has Hope.

710
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:26,139
We're all here for him.

711
00:36:27,143 --> 00:36:30,403
Having the right people love you
and care about you...

712
00:36:31,272 --> 00:36:32,902
can make all the difference.

713
00:36:32,982 --> 00:36:34,112
Let's mingle.

714
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:35,992
Come on, now, don't be shy.

715
00:36:43,242 --> 00:36:44,332
Hey, stranger.

716
00:36:45,161 --> 00:36:46,961
- Hey.
- Where have you been off to all night?

717
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:49,996
- Just been mingling.
- Oh, yeah?

718
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:51,750
How's Lydie?

719
00:36:53,169 --> 00:36:56,709
Yeah, she's a little worried about Ricky,
but I think mostly she's fine.

720
00:36:56,797 --> 00:36:58,297
Mmm. Well...

721
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:01,974
raising a teenager at her age is...

722
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:03,763
is quite a commitment.

723
00:37:05,097 --> 00:37:06,677
Yeah, she's got a big heart.

724
00:37:07,391 --> 00:37:08,391
So do you.

725
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:11,726
- I do?
- Yeah.

726
00:37:12,605 --> 00:37:15,815
You act like a tough guy,
but inside you're just a big softie.

727
00:37:16,609 --> 00:37:18,609
It's one of the things I love about you.

728
00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:22,319

739

Look, we said from the start
that we didn't want anything serious.
