1
00:00:15,056 --> 00:00:16,015
Lucille.

2
00:00:16,141 --> 00:00:17,474
Hey!

3
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:18,767
Hey, it's looking good.

4
00:00:18,893 --> 00:00:20,102
Tell me you've got good news.

5
00:00:20,228 --> 00:00:21,061
I do.

6
00:00:21,187 --> 00:00:23,272
Stable Shelters' bridge loan
has just been approved.

7
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:25,232
Harvey pulled some
strings at the bank.

8
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:26,984
Oh. Good to see you,
Harvey.

9
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:28,902
I figured you was allergic
to manual labor.

10
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:31,947
Oh, I'll get my hands dirty
if I have to, Lucille.

11
00:00:32,073 --> 00:00:33,866
But I believe
charity begins at home.

12
00:00:33,992 --> 00:00:35,617
Yeah.
Based on that Rolex you wear,

13
00:00:35,744 --> 00:00:38,287
I'd say that your favorite
cause is doing pretty good.

14
00:00:38,413 --> 00:00:40,497
We're going to need
your signature here.

15
00:00:40,623 --> 00:00:43,000
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, 15% interest?

16
00:00:43,126 --> 00:00:45,127
They're worried about
Stable Shelters' solvency.

17
00:00:45,253 --> 00:00:47,755
They're worried? They should try
being Executive Director.

18
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:51,133
If you don't recover the money
that Anthony Mazlo embezzled from us,

19
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:53,385
every one of these projects
goes dark.

20
00:00:53,511 --> 00:00:54,803
Unless you've got
a spare room or two

21
00:00:54,929 --> 00:00:56,930
for a couple thousand families
in your condo.

22
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:58,807
I'm not really a roommate kind of guy.

23
00:00:58,933 --> 00:01:00,976
- Oh.
- Harvey's deposing Elliot Perkins,

24
00:01:01,102 --> 00:01:03,312
Mazlo's number two,
this afternoon.

25
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:04,980
Perkins had to have
knowledge of this,

26
00:01:05,106 --> 00:01:06,315
and he's going to
give up his boss.

27
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:08,108
That's a promise. Excuse me.

28
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:17,326
Check it out.

29
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:22,331
Mazlo spent $500 a night on doggie
day care on his trip to Greece.

30
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:24,708
Greece.

31
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:25,834
What?

32
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,252
- Nothing.
- Tell me.

33
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:31,632
My first time
was in Greece.

34
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:34,843
Oh, my God. You're picturing
that right now, aren't you?

35
00:01:34,969 --> 00:01:37,012
I have no choice.
I'm a visual person.

36
00:01:41,893 --> 00:01:43,227
You two are
really adorable.

37
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:44,478
We're 48 hours from trial,

38
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:47,898
and you're gossiping like
two 12-year-olds in sleep-away camp.

39
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:54,863
Listen up.

40
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:57,366
Lucille Jackson is not just
the head of Stable Shelters, okay?

41
00:01:57,492 --> 00:01:59,243
She also sits on
the Board of Directors

42
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:01,036
of several of
our largest clients.

43
00:02:01,162 --> 00:02:03,038
So, if we lose this case,

44
00:02:03,164 --> 00:02:06,083
I doubt that her generosity
is going to extend to us. I would...

45
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:08,919
In my office.
Bring the Clarity Drilling IPO.

46
00:02:09,045 --> 00:02:11,004
Jerome Jensen is here.
Come on.

47
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:12,464
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

48
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:14,591
Lucille's case is all-hands-on-deck,
Harvey. You can't just...

49
00:02:14,717 --> 00:02:16,260
I can. And I am.

50
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:17,678
I thought we were
working on this together.

51
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:19,012
Yeah, we are, Louis.

52
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:21,682
The same way a golfer
and his caddie work together.

53
00:02:22,767 --> 00:02:26,395
Be that as it may, we are deposing
Elliot Perkins in fifteen minutes. So...

54
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:27,437
Perkins can wait.

55
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:30,524
Just make sure that my 9 iron is nice
and shiny when I get there. Okay?

56
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,025
Come on, Mike.

57
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:37,823
Harvey.

58
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:40,117
Jerome Jensen,
meet Mike Ross.

59
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:41,160
He's got the latest
on the IPO.

60
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:42,578
- Hello, Mike.
- Mr. Jensen.

61
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:45,247
I'm not here to talk
about my business, Harvey.

62
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:48,500
Looks like my daughter
might be getting into some trouble.

63
00:02:48,626 --> 00:02:50,460
Mildred Wisnewski.

64
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:52,880
What's Lola doing
with a fake ID?

65
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:54,715
Well, that's what I hope
you can find out.

66
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:56,884
It slipped out of her purse
when she was ordering a drink

67
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:57,885
at a friend's bar mitzvah.

68
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:59,887
Any idea what it's about?

69
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:06,101
My relationship with Lola
has been rocky for a few years.

70
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:08,979
If I asked her,
she'd just lie.

71
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:13,775
The truth is, I don't need to know.
I just need you to take care of it.

72
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:15,944
Thank you.

73
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:20,324
What the hell is Harvey doing? He's
supposed to be deposing Elliot Perkins.

74
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:21,366
He's with a client.

75
00:03:21,492 --> 00:03:23,702
I don't care.
We have a deposition.

76
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:25,913
Don't even try it, Louis.

77
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,000
I'm sorry.

78
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:32,878
Let's just start over. Okay?
Hi, Donna.

79
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:33,921
Hi.

80
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:36,089
You know I like you. Right?

81
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:37,716
But in the firm's
food chain,

82
00:03:37,842 --> 00:03:39,134
I am a humpback whale

83
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:41,261
and you are phytoplankton.

84
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:46,642
June 3rd, 1997.

85
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:54,566
That date means
nothing to me.

86
00:03:54,692 --> 00:03:56,026
Doesn't it?

87
00:03:57,779 --> 00:04:00,614
- Who told you?
- Is the important thing how I know?

88
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,366
Or that I know?

89
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:03,533
Does Harvey know?

90
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:04,785
He can.

91
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:06,245
I am going to pay you.

92
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:08,205
I just don't have
cash on me right now.

93
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:11,500
So I'm going to just tell Norma to run
her old ass out to the ATM,

94
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:12,751
- and bring it back in a jiff.
- Hmm.

95
00:04:12,877 --> 00:04:14,378
- All right?
- I don't want your money, Louis.

96
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:15,420
I just want you to...

97
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:16,838
I was not here.

98
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:18,465
I was not here.
I was not here.

99
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:22,761
All right.
Let's get started, shall we?

100
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:24,972
Isn't Harvey Specter
leading this deposition?

101
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:26,556
He sent me.

102
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:29,142
Now, Mr. Perkins,

103
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:31,812
my first question to you is

104
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:34,982
do you sleep well at night?

105
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:40,487
Of course you do. Because you have
a roof. And a bed. And running water.

106
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:42,322
And by contrast,
thousands of families

107
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:43,490
are going to be sleeping
on the street

108
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:46,326
when Stable Shelters is forced
to suspend their operations.

109
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:48,829
All because of
the money that you stole.

110
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:49,997
I never stole anything.

111
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:51,581
You're Mazlo's number two.

112
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:53,250
The money was embezzled.
Do you deny that?

113
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:54,334
- Absolutely.
- Please.

114
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:57,004
Robert, I know as General Counsel,
you just basically push paper.

115
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,673
But will you please warn Mr. Perkins
of the penalties of perjury?

116
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:01,216
Look, I'm not aware
of any perjury.

117
00:05:01,342 --> 00:05:03,176
We know about your account
in the Caymans.

118
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,178
- Twenty million dollars.
- Are you... Are you kidding me?

119
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:06,930
That transaction
was legitimate.

120
00:05:07,056 --> 00:05:09,766
Oh. When I take this public,
you're going to be disgraced.

121
00:05:09,892 --> 00:05:12,978
Your wife, your children,
your whole family, disgraced.

122
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:15,897
- Would you show my client some respect?
- And... And that transaction

123
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:17,065
had nothing to do
with the firm.

124
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:18,150
Bullshit.

125
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:20,861
You either took your cut from Mazlo
or it was hush money.

126
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:23,530
Either way, you're going to live
the rest of your life as a pariah

127
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:24,865
or you give up Mazlo now.

128
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:26,158
Is this a deposition
or an inquisition?

129
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:28,618
This is ridiculous.
I can show you the records.

130
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:29,786
Oh, sure, you can.

131
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:32,706
Because you're the guy who invented
losses in mortgage-backed securities

132
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:34,541
when you never
even bought them.

133
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:36,043
I had no part in that.

134
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:38,420
But you were aware of it
and you did nothing about it.

135
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:39,921
Come on. Louis.

136
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:41,506
Could I... Could I get
a glass of water, please?

137
00:05:41,632 --> 00:05:44,384
You can't get any water.
We don't have any.

138
00:05:44,802 --> 00:05:46,845
You give up Mazlo now,
and this all stops.

139
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:48,013
All right, look.

140
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:49,222
My client needs a break.

141
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:50,932
We can continue this
in ten minutes.

142
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:53,018
I'm just getting started.

143
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:56,688
I don't get it.
She looks so sweet.

144
00:05:56,814 --> 00:05:58,148
Don't let the photo
fool you.

145
00:05:58,274 --> 00:05:59,649
She's less girl-next-door,

146
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:02,194
- more girl-with-the-dragon-tattoo.
- Hmm.

147
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,905
Look, my plate is full
with Stable Shelters.

148
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:06,907
I need you to look
into Jerome's daughter.

149
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:08,617
Why didn't he just hire
a private investigator?

150
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:11,912
Because if there's a problem,
an investigator can't fix it.

151
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:13,955
I'm not just a lawyer
to Jerome, okay?

152
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:18,460
I'm... I'm more like...
Robert Duvall in The Godfather.

153
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:20,128
His consigliere.

154
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,506
Okay.

155
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:23,715
What?

156
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:27,719
Uh, nothing. Just if you're
his Robert Duvall, you're coming to me,

157
00:06:27,845 --> 00:06:30,680
so, technically,
I'm your Robert Duvall.

158
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:33,016
You're my Fredo.

159
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:35,727
Fredo? No.

160
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:38,688
Clear the hall, please.

161
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:43,777
Robert,
what the hell happened to Perkins?

162
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:45,404
Ask that pit bull of yours.

163
00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:51,243
Oh, no. Actually,
I prefer a female masseuse.

164
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:56,081
Is that... Can I call you right back?
Right back. Okay. Bye.

165
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:58,333
Perkins just got wheeled
out on a stretcher.

166
00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:00,293
Well, he couldn't handle the heat.
He's probably faking it.

167
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,462
What were you thinking,
starting that deposition without me?

168
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:06,299
I don't know.
Maybe if you were doing your job...

169
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:07,509
Oh, no.

170
00:07:07,635 --> 00:07:08,468
What?

171
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:11,388
It's from Geller.
Perkins wasn't faking anything.

172
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:14,599
Our best chance to nail
Anthony Mazlo is dead.

173
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:19,771
See the money,
wanna stay for your meal

174
00:07:19,897 --> 00:07:23,108
Get another piece of pie
for your wife

175
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:26,486
Everybody wanna know
how it feel

176
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:29,739
Everybody wanna see
what it's like

177
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:33,160
I'll even eat a bean pie
I don't mind

178
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:34,828
Me and missy is so early

179
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:36,997
Busy, busy making money

180
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:38,248
All right!

181
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:43,086
All step back
I'm 'bout to dance

182
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:46,006
The greenback boogie

183
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:54,723
Well, he blew off the deposition.
So I was just picking up the slack.

184
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:56,057
I was letting
Perkins sweat.

185
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:58,643
It was a tactic.
Which you completely undermined.

186
00:07:58,769 --> 00:08:01,313
Well, I believe I made
him sweat and then some.

187
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:02,898
Are you actually proud
of what you did?

188
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:04,149
As far as I'm concerned,

189
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:07,068
whatever happened to that guy
was a result of his own guilt.

190
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:10,780
And I will not apologize for deposing
a criminal in a vigorous manner.

191
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:14,367
Losing Perkins
is a complication.

192
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:17,454
We're just going to have to work harder
to unearth Mazlo's money trail.

193
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:20,665
As for what happened,
I've spoken to the hospital.

194
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:23,543
And the cause of death
was a pulmonary embolism.

195
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:24,711
It was nothing you did.

196
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:27,172
Would it be okay
if I took the credit?

197
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:29,007
Louis, I need to have
a word with Harvey.

198
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:30,258
Okay.

199
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:41,144
Financial crime
is that man's forte.

200
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,104
Yes, he over-stepped
his rank.

201
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:45,106
But I'm not about to throw
the baby out with the bathwater.

202
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:46,274
Louis is the bathwater.

203
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,819
Believe it or not, Harvey, you can be a
real pain in the ass to work with, too.

204
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:51,696
Oh, I get along
with me just fine.

205
00:08:51,822 --> 00:08:54,783
Yes, well, I'm not about to tell
Lucille Jackson that we didn't win

206
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:56,493
because we couldn't
work together.

207
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:59,162
You need to figure out
how to collaborate with Louis.

208
00:09:08,464 --> 00:09:11,091
So the name on
Lola Jensen's fake ID

209
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:12,634
wasn't just pulled
from thin air.

210
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,303
It belongs to an assistant controller
at Clarity Drilling.

211
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:17,264
And you're telling me this why?

212
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,140
You wanted me
to look into it.

213
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:20,976
I didn't ask you to
explain the problem to me.

214
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:22,936
I asked you
to fix it for me.

215
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:25,105
Hey.
Did Louis really kill a guy?

216
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:27,816
Is that what the associate rumor mill
has been churning out?

217
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:29,818
Actually,
I think he started it.

218
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:34,739
Yeah, he also claims to be 6' 2"
with a full head of hair.

219
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:36,950
Louis with hair.
That's good.

220
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:43,081
How did you
get past Donna?

221
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:44,791
You waited until she peed,
didn't you?

222
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:47,294
I mean,
the woman retains water like a camel.

223
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:52,799
I see that the greatest band of all time
is conspicuously absent.

224
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:54,884
And who would that be, Louis?

225
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:57,053
Oh. I don't know.
A little British band called Queen?

226
00:09:57,179 --> 00:09:58,179
Should have seen that coming.

227
00:09:58,306 --> 00:10:00,640
You know, real musicians,
they don't wear eyeliner.

228
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:03,476
Oh, really? Why don't you tell that
to the artist formerly known as Prince,

229
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:06,438
who is once again
named Prince?

230
00:10:06,897 --> 00:10:08,148
What do you want, Louis?

231
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:09,858
Well, I think,
now that we're working together,

232
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:11,318
we should set some ground rules.

233
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:13,903
First rule.
Never touch my records.

234
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,655
Or anything else
in this office.

235
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:17,532
Fine.

236
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:20,327
That includes the furniture.

237
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:24,456
I'm trying to build
a rapport with you.

238
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:28,668
Okay? I mean, I think
our relationship needs a little work.

239
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:31,796
Let's hold off the couples counseling
until our fifth anniversary.

240
00:10:31,922 --> 00:10:33,006
Don't you think?

241
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:37,344
Look, Mazlo's lawyer moved
to push up the trial.

242
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,638
They know we need time
to cultivate another witness.

243
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:41,139
Well, I say we bluff.

244
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:43,892
I mean, Perkins implicated Mazlo

245
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:45,810
the minute his lawyer
walked out of the room.

246
00:10:45,936 --> 00:10:46,853
It's hearsay, Louis.

247
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:48,396
Not if it's
a deathbed confession.

248
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:51,149
Maybe while Geller was
making the 911 call,

249
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:53,735
I had a little conversation
with Perkins.

250
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:57,364
So you want to lie about
what Perkins said and how he said it?

251
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:58,865
Well, what's your brilliant solution,
Harvey?

252
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:01,284
I'm having the money
in Perkins' account traced as we speak.

253
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:02,786
And I have
another witness in mind.

254
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:05,121
I get Anthony Mazlo across that table,
you know I'll break him.

255
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:06,331
The way you broke Perkins?

256
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:08,291
- Yeah, if need be.
- You're not hearing me.

257
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:09,834
We need to hold off
on any meeting.

258
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,921
- I just want to know why that's...
- That's final, Louis.

259
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:26,059
Question.

260
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:27,811
Why would someone
named Lola Jensen

261
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:30,939
ever want to be known
as Mildred Wisnewski?

262
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,233
Who are you?

263
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:35,235
My name is Mike Ross.
I'm a lawyer.

264
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:37,070
Let me guess.
Pearson Hardman?

265
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:43,576
You know, forging a government document
like this after 911

266
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:45,412
is next to impossible.

267
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:48,957
God, there must have been
a glitch at the DMV.

268
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,291
Why did you come here?

269
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:51,960
Your father came to us
because he's worried about you.

270
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:54,295
If he was that worried,
he'd be here himself.

271
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:56,589
He wouldn't have sent
an empty suit.

272
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:02,804
You don't know
anything about me.

273
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:05,223
I, on the other hand,
know that you used this ID

274
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:09,436
to funnel payments from Clarity Drilling
to some fake company that you set up.

275
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:10,979
Locksley LLC?

276
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:13,440
You're stealing money
from your father's company.

277
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:15,442
A couple million so far.

278
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:18,778
I don't need to know why.
But I do need you to return it. Now.

279
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:21,448
Actually,
you do need to know why.

280
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:26,494
This is groundwater from Clarity's
fracking operation south of Tulsa.

281
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:29,080
It's got elevated levels
of dibutoxyethanol,

282
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:30,707
methane, and benzene.

283
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:35,170
This compares samples
taken pre-drilling

284
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:36,796
to levels taken last week.

285
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:39,257
How did you get that?
That's classified company data.

286
00:12:39,383 --> 00:12:41,342
I'm good with computers.

287
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:46,347
Wait a minute. Locksley LLC. As in
Robin of Locksley. As in Robin Hood.

288
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:50,393
These toxins are known to cause kidney
failure, liver cancer, and infertility.

289
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:53,146
The EPA fines
were a slap on the wrist.

290
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:55,607
But the settlement that your firm
negotiated with the victims...

291
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:57,817
It doesn't matter
how pure your motives are.

292
00:12:57,943 --> 00:13:00,028
You're committing
a very serious crime.

293
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:01,696
Threaten all you want. Okay?

294
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:04,449
There is no way that my father
is going to let this go public

295
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:06,326
right before his IPO.

296
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:08,328
I'm not giving
the money back.

297
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:11,122
I'm giving it away.

298
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:16,294
In terms of living relatives,
I didn't find anything.

299
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:20,131
But when I looked into the estates
of relatives who'd passed away,

300
00:13:20,257 --> 00:13:22,967
the holding was originally
in the name of the aunt.

301
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:25,094
Your theory on Perkins
was right.

302
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:26,304
Harvey, what are you doing?

303
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:28,473
Rachel's services
are under my purview.

304
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:30,558
I'm sorry.
I'm going to change that.

305
00:13:30,684 --> 00:13:33,520
Anthony Mazlo and his attorney
are in the conference room.

306
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:34,938
At whose invitation?

307
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:37,232
Oh, what,
you think I called them?

308
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:39,442
You... I... I didn't.

309
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:41,277
Then Mazlo feels
he has an advantage

310
00:13:41,403 --> 00:13:43,154
and he's pressing it.

311
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:47,659
Hey, fellows. Thanks for meeting us
on such short notice.

312
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:50,370
I figured you'd be
on a flight right now, Mr. Mazlo.

313
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:52,497
Somewhere
with no extradition agreement.

314
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:53,957
Let's get to the point.

315
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:56,000
Without Perkins,
you don't have a case.

316
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:59,128
This report summarizes
an internal investigation we conducted.

317
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:01,214
What Inez has just handed you
is hard evidence

318
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:04,300
of fraudulent investments
and fake losses perpetrated by Perkins.

319
00:14:04,426 --> 00:14:06,177
You guys have a real penchant
for fiction, don't you?

320
00:14:06,303 --> 00:14:07,554
No, he duped all of us.

321
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,473
As CEO, he betrayed me
just as much as the investors.

322
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:12,267
We found an offshore
account worth $20 million.

323
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:13,226
Just hold on a second.

324
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:16,813
Lucille Jackson trusted you
to manage $150 million endowment.

325
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:18,648
If Perkins takes 20,
where the hell is the rest of it?

326
00:14:18,774 --> 00:14:21,568
In light of these findings,
we'd like to offer a settlement.

327
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:23,486
- Yeah.
- Fifteen million.

328
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:26,489
Ten cents on the dollar?
That's a slap in the face.

329
00:14:26,615 --> 00:14:29,784
Well, we advise all our clients
that investments carry risk.

330
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:32,662
You want a risk free return,
buy treasury bills or...

331
00:14:32,788 --> 00:14:36,040
I don't know,
hide your money under the mattress.

332
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:38,960
While you were writing
the great American novel,

333
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:40,587
I've been checking facts.

334
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:44,173
The $20 million that Perkins
had overseas was legitimate.

335
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:45,925
He was innocent.

336
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:49,429
The money your firm embezzled
is still out there.

337
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:51,931
And this so-called
investigation,

338
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:54,475
it isn't worth the paper
it's printed on.

339
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:57,562
Well, Lucille Jackson
may beg to differ, counselor.

340
00:14:57,688 --> 00:14:59,355
A bridge loan means
she's desperate.

341
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:01,691
Our offer is non-negotiable.

342
00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:04,986
I won't accept this offer today
or a year from now.

343
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:08,823
Now, since you've all invited yourselves
over, feel free to see yourselves out.

344
00:15:16,665 --> 00:15:18,833
So, first, you attack me
for wanting to lie about Perkins.

345
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:21,336
And then, you turn around
and do the same exact thing?

346
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:23,004
I wasn't lying.

347
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,964
What are you saying to me?

348
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:26,382
Harvey, what the hell
are you saying to me?

349
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:27,967
That Perkins had no
involvement whatsoever?

350
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:30,762
That's exactly what I'm saying, Louis.
He was innocent.

351
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:32,013
Huh?

352
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:42,231
It's no surprise
that Mazlo low-balled us.

353
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:45,860
I'm just passing along
this offer as a formality.

354
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:50,031
Fifteen million dollars
is not insignificant.

355
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:51,824
But now is not
the time to settle.

356
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,701
We have to
strengthen our hand.

357
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:56,329
All right, here's my problem.
Best case scenario.

358
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:58,915
We go to trial,
the jury awards us a settlement.

359
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:01,209
Obviously, Mazlo appeals that.

360
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:02,794
It's three years
before I see any money,

361
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,504
and my foundation
is long gone by that point.

362
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:07,590
No. I'm not going to let Mazlo pocket
the lion's share of your endowment.

363
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:10,051
I'm not interested
in a Pyrrhic victory.

364
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:11,302
Neither are we.

365
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:14,555
And to prove it,
we're going to forego our usual fee

366
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:17,725
and return to you the money
you've already paid.

367
00:16:17,851 --> 00:16:20,770
I grew up sleeping
in my mama's car.

368
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:25,775
And in and out of more halfway houses
than I can count.

369
00:16:25,901 --> 00:16:29,362
And one thing I realized
is that every penny matters.

370
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:31,948
So thank you.

371
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:34,993
What you going to do?

372
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:36,327
Perkins may have
been innocent,

373
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:38,121
but he was still
Mazlo's direct report.

374
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:39,205
I'm going to find out
what he knew.

375
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:40,540
Thank you.

376
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:44,252
Your job is to verify every detail
of Mazlo's internal investigation.

377
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:45,920
It is not about the crime now.

378
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:46,879
It's about the cover-up.

379
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,673
This says
Perkins acted alone.

380
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:51,009
Well, he's the perfect scapegoat.
He can't defend himself.

381
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:52,260
You want to go
to the bathroom?

382
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:54,804
You don't bother coming back.

383
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,890
By the way, that goes for
personal phone calls,

384
00:16:58,017 --> 00:16:59,183
emails, and texts.

385
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:02,562
I detect a whiff of slacking,
you are done.

386
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:04,564
Get it?

387
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:07,692
You find anything,
I'll be in my office.

388
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:13,781
Louis.
I'm still working on Harvey's case.

389
00:17:13,907 --> 00:17:15,575
Jerome Jensen can go screw himself
for all I care.

390
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:16,868
But Harvey
explicitly told me...

391
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:19,037
I don't care
if a burning bush told you, Mike.

392
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:22,665
The only commandments you need
to focus on right now come from me.

393
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:26,961
There is something wrong
with Louis.

394
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:28,963
That's not my problem.
I answer to Harvey.

395
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:31,424
...sitting home alone
with your kids and no job.

396
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,633
Harvey.

397
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:33,801
You solve Jerome's problem,
yet?

398
00:17:33,927 --> 00:17:36,137
Uh, about to.
But I need your corporate card first.

399
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:37,722
What for?

400
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:40,391
Well, I thought you didn't want me
to explain it to you.

401
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:42,643
You're right. I don't.

402
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:47,190
Okay.

403
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:52,195
It's killing you, not knowing what
I'm going to use this for, isn't it?

404
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:53,488
Nope.

405
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:55,448
Please let me tell you?

406
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:58,367
If you bring that back to me and
it smells like stripper, you're fired.

407
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:04,082
I don't...
I don't go to places like that.

408
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:09,712
You had to send someone?
You couldn't just call me?

409
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:14,092
If you wanted this to be private,
you should have just robbed me.

410
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:15,927
You robbed the company,
I had to involve other people.

411
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:18,471
Okay. Why don't we take a seat?
I think that we could probably...

412
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:19,931
Why are you here?

413
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:22,642
I want to tell you
my side of things.

414
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:23,893
Okay.

415
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:26,938
I'm not proud of the fact
that we contaminated people's water.

416
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:28,564
But we apologized.

417
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:30,775
We implemented safeguards.

418
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:33,653
We negotiated a payout
that was more than generous.

419
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:36,405
If that's what you think,
then you are lying to yourself.

420
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:37,865
I think that we
could keep this civil.

421
00:18:37,991 --> 00:18:41,494
No, she's right. It's true.
I am lying to myself.

422
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:45,456
I thought this was a phase. That, uh,
it was hormones. That it would pass.

423
00:18:45,582 --> 00:18:47,291
But the truth is...

424
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:49,293
I raised a thief.

425
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:51,045
Okay. I think we're going
to need a minute. Thank you.

426
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:54,423
A thief. My research
is making the planet more habitable.

427
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:57,468
Okay? You are making money
destroying it.

428
00:18:57,594 --> 00:18:59,804
You have no respect for me,
that's fine.

429
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:02,014
But at least respect
the workers.

430
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,432
You're stealing from them,
too.

431
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:06,269
You think I'm such a criminal?
Arrest me.

432
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:08,855
So, I organized this
so that you two could clear the air.

433
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:10,148
But it seems we've gotten off
on the wrong foot.

434
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:12,859
You know what?
It's the same story as always, Dad.

435
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:15,236
You duck
your responsibilities.

436
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:18,698
Lola. Lola.

437
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:28,082
What if I paid the company back
with my own money?

438
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:29,458
I don't think that
would be a very good idea.

439
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:30,626
It would make you
a conspirator.

440
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:32,503
I'm not turning
my daughter in to the police.

441
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:34,463
This is not about
the company image.

442
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:36,507
Well, the good news is
she hasn't distributed the money, yet.

443
00:19:36,633 --> 00:19:38,050
The money is irrelevant.

444
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:43,890
I came to Pearson Hardman
to take care of this.

445
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:46,601
Instead, my daughter and I
are further apart than ever.

446
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:55,318
I can't imagine
how hard it is right now.

447
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:59,155
People are saying
the most horrible things about Elliot.

448
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:01,032
They must think
I've gone deaf.

449
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:04,827
Anthony Mazlo has been dragging
your husband's name through the mud

450
00:20:04,953 --> 00:20:07,163
to make him a scapegoat,
Mrs. Perkins.

451
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:09,415
I'm here to help.

452
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:11,542
I don't understand.
You work for the other side.

453
00:20:11,668 --> 00:20:13,544
I work
for a charitable organization

454
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:15,713
that had all
its money stolen.

455
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:18,257
I'm on the other side of Anthony Mazlo,
not your husband.

456
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:21,761
And I don't want to see his memory
painted with the same brush.

457
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,763
What would I have to do?

458
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:26,807
- This isn't the time or the place.
- No, it's okay.

459
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:28,684
What would I have to do?

460
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:32,480
I'd like to know everything Elliot
has ever told you about Mazlo.

461
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:34,565
Any details would help.

462
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:36,817
Mrs. Perkins.

463
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:39,528
Uh, I'm Louis Litt,
and I just want to let you know

464
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:42,365
that I'm going to do whatever it takes
to clear your husband's name.

465
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:44,659
His name?

466
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:49,372
My husband would be alive
today if it weren't for you.

467
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:50,581
We don't know that.

468
00:20:50,707 --> 00:20:52,708
I know what happened
in that room.

469
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:54,710
Well, at the time,
we didn't have all the facts.

470
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:56,504
But now, we do.

471
00:20:58,298 --> 00:21:02,218
I can't believe that
you have the audacity to come here.

472
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:05,513
I don't ever
want to see your face again.

473
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:09,976
And you can forget about
me helping you.

474
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:15,856
What the hell are you doing?

475
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:18,025
I was deposing the widow.
Just like you.

476
00:21:18,151 --> 00:21:20,236
I came here
to pay my respects

477
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:21,862
and initiate a relationship,

478
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:23,447
not aggravate
a grieving woman.

479
00:21:23,573 --> 00:21:24,782
I brought flowers.

480
00:21:24,908 --> 00:21:27,535
You just cost us
a potential witness.

481
00:21:28,036 --> 00:21:29,662
Oh, really? Well, maybe,

482
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:31,580
maybe if you'd shared
your game plan with me...

483
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:33,624
Oh. The same way that you shared
your game plan with me?

484
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:36,419
How do you expect her to react
to seeing you?

485
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:39,714
You need to get
your shit together

486
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,966
and find us a new witness.

487
00:21:56,523 --> 00:21:57,732
Lola.

488
00:21:58,233 --> 00:22:00,568
I wanted to apologize
for earlier today.

489
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:01,527
Can I come in?

490
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:04,530
Uh, yeah. Of course.

491
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:06,824
Nice gesture.
The botanical gardens.

492
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:10,202
Oh. Yeah. He said it was
a pretty special place for you guys.

493
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:12,663
It was.
And then, he became CEO.

494
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:16,042
But I'm not here to reminisce.

495
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:20,588
I must say, I was really impressed
you figured out what I was doing.

496
00:22:21,256 --> 00:22:24,342
Especially
since you're not even a real lawyer.

497
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:25,926
What are you...
What are you talking about?

498
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:29,180
I accessed Harvard Law
School's alumni directory.

499
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:31,974
Every class that graduated
for the last ten years.

500
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:35,227
No record
of Mike Ross at all.

501
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:37,188
Yeah, the Dean's office
was supposed to fix that.

502
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:39,231
They... They put my name wrong
in the system.

503
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:42,693
I checked your Social
Security number against the database.

504
00:22:42,819 --> 00:22:44,653
How did you get
my Social Security number?

505
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,072
Easily.

506
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:47,907
Here's the deal.

507
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:49,450
Leave me alone,

508
00:22:49,576 --> 00:22:50,993
or I expose you.

509
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:04,882
You don't really
seem that worried about this.

510
00:23:05,008 --> 00:23:06,425
Threats like hers
are a tactic.

511
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:08,552
They're effective
because they distract you

512
00:23:08,678 --> 00:23:10,012
from what you're supposed to be doing.

513
00:23:10,138 --> 00:23:12,807
Are you crazy? What we should
be doing is backing the hell off.

514
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:14,100
And how would that go, huh?

515
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:16,060
"Jerome, you came to us
with a problem.

516
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:19,105
"We discovered that your daughter
stole $2 million from your company.

517
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:20,981
"And our conclusion
is you're shit out of luck"?

518
00:23:21,108 --> 00:23:22,775
I don't really care
how it would go.

519
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:24,276
All I care about is my life

520
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:26,028
and keeping our secret.

521
00:23:26,154 --> 00:23:28,489
I told you
it's a distraction.

522
00:23:28,615 --> 00:23:30,449
She won't pull that trigger.

523
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:32,618
Why do you think
she hasn't distributed that money, yet?

524
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:34,995
Why do you think Jerome
doesn't want us to go to the police?

525
00:23:35,122 --> 00:23:36,539
I don't know.

526
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:38,582
It's because they both
want to bury the hatchet.

527
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:41,293
And if any of that stuff happens,
they can't.

528
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,087
Then, what?

529
00:23:43,213 --> 00:23:45,005
Figure out a way
to make him reconcile.

530
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:46,715
It's easy.

531
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:48,634
Yeah. It's easy.

532
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:51,846
Inez, right? Louis Litt.

533
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:53,222
I know who you are.

534
00:23:53,348 --> 00:23:54,765
So, is this what you do
for Mazlo?

535
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:56,100
You clean up
his dirty laundry?

536
00:23:56,226 --> 00:23:57,143
Leave me alone.

537
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:58,936
You know, you have
your whole career ahead of you.

538
00:23:59,062 --> 00:24:01,021
When Mazlo goes down
and you're part of this cover-up,

539
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:02,940
- no one is going to hire you.
- I can't help you.

540
00:24:03,066 --> 00:24:04,442
Listen.
Can I just tell you something, Inez?

541
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:07,653
In my experience,
people respond to two things, okay?

542
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:09,447
And that's the carrot
and the stick.

543
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:10,698
Now, I prefer the stick.

544
00:24:10,824 --> 00:24:12,199
And if you do not help me,

545
00:24:12,325 --> 00:24:16,370
I will devote my considerable expertise
to sticking it to you.

546
00:24:16,663 --> 00:24:18,497
The same way
you stuck it to Perkins.

547
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,544
Inez, stop.

548
00:24:27,174 --> 00:24:28,716
Let's go with the carrot.

549
00:24:33,096 --> 00:24:35,473
Inez. Harvey Specter.

550
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:37,808
I appreciate
you coming forward.

551
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:40,644
I should have
done this sooner.

552
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:42,521
What changed?

553
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:45,566
I can't be a part
of a company like that anymore.

554
00:24:45,692 --> 00:24:49,153
Are you ready to testify
against Anthony Mazlo in open court?

555
00:24:50,071 --> 00:24:51,363
I am.

556
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:53,657
I assume you've documented
his malfeasance.

557
00:24:53,783 --> 00:24:56,118
Because otherwise,
it's "he said, she said".

558
00:24:59,873 --> 00:25:01,499
The entire paper trail.

559
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:04,376
From the beginning
all the way to last week.

560
00:25:07,422 --> 00:25:11,342
Harvey asked me to fix
this problem with Lola, but I can't.

561
00:25:12,427 --> 00:25:15,387
Because your daughter's
not the problem, Mr. Jensen.

562
00:25:16,473 --> 00:25:17,973
You are.

563
00:25:20,143 --> 00:25:21,477
Are you trying to get fired?

564
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:23,395
No. I'm not.

565
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:25,981
I'm your attorney.

566
00:25:26,107 --> 00:25:28,943
It's my job
to give you advice.

567
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:31,862
But you're her father.
It's your job to raise her.

568
00:25:31,988 --> 00:25:33,197
Now, you can go
to another firm,

569
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:35,991
but there's not a lawyer in the city
that can do that job for you.

570
00:25:36,117 --> 00:25:38,536
Please don't lecture me
on parenting.

571
00:25:39,496 --> 00:25:42,248
Mr. Jensen, I had a
difficult relationship with my father.

572
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:43,832
So, trust me
when I tell you

573
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:45,459
that Lola
wants to forgive you.

574
00:25:45,585 --> 00:25:47,503
But she needs you
to take the first step.

575
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:48,587
Well, we tried it your way.

576
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:51,882
We went to lunch,
and you saw how well that worked out.

577
00:25:53,843 --> 00:25:55,594
My daughter is not a child.

578
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,887
She's an adult.

579
00:25:57,013 --> 00:25:59,098
She made these choices
as an adult.

580
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:01,684
- If you just found a way to...
- You're my lawyer.

581
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:03,519
This is a legal problem.

582
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:08,315
My daughter brought this
on herself.

583
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:12,861
Now, I desperately
do not want her to go to prison.

584
00:26:13,613 --> 00:26:15,864
But if she doesn't return the money,
she will.

585
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,409
Thank you.

586
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:23,664
Where's Mazlo?
He was afraid to face us himself?

587
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:25,332
What do you want?

588
00:26:25,792 --> 00:26:28,419
We know about
your entire scheme.

589
00:26:28,545 --> 00:26:29,378
What scheme?

590
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:32,590
Oh, the scheme where Mazlo
is laundering money through Dubai.

591
00:26:34,467 --> 00:26:35,968
How do you know about Dubai?

592
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:38,053
We cultivated
another source.

593
00:26:38,179 --> 00:26:39,638
What kind of settlement
are you looking for?

594
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:42,474
One that includes
punitive damages.

595
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:45,894
Send Inez in here, please.

596
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:47,938
I don't think
you'll find her at her desk.

597
00:26:48,064 --> 00:26:50,357
- Why not?
- Because she agreed to testify for us.

598
00:26:53,069 --> 00:26:54,194
I doubt that.

599
00:27:00,327 --> 00:27:02,828
When your colleague approached her,
she came straight to us.

600
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:04,371
He even tried to bribe me.

601
00:27:04,497 --> 00:27:06,332
He said if I ratted
out Mr. Mazlo,

602
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:09,084
he'd get me a job as an
assistant to Jessica Pearson.

603
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:12,004
Everything she told you
was a complete fabrication.

604
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:13,964
There is no Dubai.

605
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:17,551
I seem to recall you
mentioning something about

606
00:27:17,677 --> 00:27:20,387
penalties for perjury
at our last meeting.

607
00:27:20,513 --> 00:27:24,016
Well, the penalty for
bribing a witness is just as severe.

608
00:27:25,101 --> 00:27:27,811
And we're willing to overlook
that indiscretion

609
00:27:27,937 --> 00:27:30,397
if you convince your client
to take our settlement offer.

610
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:34,360
Well,
our revised settlement offer.

611
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:36,278
- Revised?
- Yes.

612
00:27:36,946 --> 00:27:39,990
Exactly half
of what it was before.

613
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,541
What the hell
were you thinking?

614
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:50,876
We needed a new witness.

615
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:52,461
You didn't think to look
into her story?

616
00:27:52,587 --> 00:27:54,004
I don't know.
Did you look into it?

617
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:57,091
You were the one who brought her in.
I assumed you had.

618
00:27:57,217 --> 00:27:58,967
Like any halfway
decent lawyer would.

619
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:00,052
We were under the gun.

620
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:03,222
And I was under strict instructions
from my golf pro to get another witness.

621
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:05,683
No, I told you to get another witness,
not bribe one.

622
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:07,309
That's enough.

623
00:28:07,435 --> 00:28:09,770
As for the threat against Louis,
no money changed hands.

624
00:28:09,896 --> 00:28:11,271
I'm not concerned with Louis.

625
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:13,148
He brought your name into it,
okay?

626
00:28:13,274 --> 00:28:14,900
The offer was to be
your assistant.

627
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:17,361
Now, you're exposed
because of what he did.

628
00:28:17,487 --> 00:28:19,405
- Is that true?
- She is an executive assistant

629
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:21,156
to the head
of a major investment firm.

630
00:28:21,282 --> 00:28:23,158
She's not going to work
for a junior partner.

631
00:28:23,284 --> 00:28:24,118
So you tried to bribe her.

632
00:28:24,244 --> 00:28:27,037
No, it wasn't a bribe, Jessica.
It was an incentive.

633
00:28:27,163 --> 00:28:31,458
I thought she'd be more likely to talk
if she wasn't worried about being fired.

634
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:34,086
I want you to go to Mazlo
and take their offer.

635
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:35,337
I'm not ready to do that.

636
00:28:35,463 --> 00:28:36,672
I'm not, either.

637
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:38,173
I waived Lucille's fee

638
00:28:38,299 --> 00:28:40,884
because a certain senior partner
said we'd never go to trial.

639
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:42,761
I said that before
you stuck me with Louis.

640
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:45,848
Not the point.
She can't afford it, and neither can we.

641
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:47,266
Give me time.

642
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:48,767
Give it to me without Louis,

643
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:51,937
and we'll see who can afford it
and who can't.

644
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:56,567
You have until
the end of the day.

645
00:28:56,693 --> 00:29:01,488
You come up empty,
I'm taking the offer to Lucille myself.

646
00:29:04,117 --> 00:29:06,452
Jessica.
I went to Perkins' widow.

647
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:08,454
Not another word.

648
00:29:11,624 --> 00:29:12,875
You try something like that again,

649
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:16,336
and it will be
your last day at this firm.

650
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:29,600
You said Jerome wouldn't pull
the trigger. You were wrong. He's ready.

651
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:30,976
I don't have time
for that right now.

652
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:34,772
Harvey, when the police show up
at Lola's doorstep, we're done.

653
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:36,607
Has she distributed
the money, yet?

654
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:37,775
No, she hasn't.
But she's about...

655
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:39,610
She hasn't. And she won't.

656
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:42,529
Because what she wants
is her daddy's attention.

657
00:29:42,655 --> 00:29:44,615
Now, sit down with me
and let's deal with this.

658
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:47,493
Yeah. Yeah, sure.
Why don't you tell me what you need?

659
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:52,581
Mazlo was in Liechtenstein the day
that Lucille's endowment evaporated.

660
00:29:52,707 --> 00:29:54,792
Yeah, maybe he was skiing.

661
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:57,002
Nobody goes to Liechtenstein
for pleasure.

662
00:29:57,128 --> 00:29:59,880
Why don't we subpoena the bank records?
How many banks can there be?

663
00:30:00,006 --> 00:30:02,090
That place is like
Switzerland on steroids.

664
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:03,383
We'll never see
those records.

665
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:06,011
So what the hell
do you want from me, then?

666
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:07,971
What did you
just say to me?

667
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:14,520
I once suggested that we hack
Harvard's records to cover my ass,

668
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:16,605
and you laughed at me.

669
00:30:16,731 --> 00:30:18,023
And now,
it turns out that you were wrong,

670
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:20,275
and it's about to cost me
my career.

671
00:30:20,401 --> 00:30:22,110
Where are you going?

672
00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:23,487
You told me to fix my case.

673
00:30:23,613 --> 00:30:25,489
Why don't you fix yours?

674
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:02,109
I hope you came here
to tell me Harvey's backing off.

675
00:31:02,235 --> 00:31:04,069
I wish I could,
but he's not.

676
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:05,112
That's too bad.

677
00:31:05,238 --> 00:31:06,989
You had
such a promising career.

678
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:09,324
God, Lola. You act like
you care about a higher cause.

679
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:11,994
But of all the companies that exist,
you chose your dad's.

680
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:14,288
A company that's trying
to make amends for what it did.

681
00:31:14,414 --> 00:31:17,875
I really don't need to hear
another speech from a wannabe suit.

682
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:20,085
God, you think
I'm your enemy, huh?

683
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:21,503
Well, I'm not.

684
00:31:21,629 --> 00:31:25,465
I didn't even come here
to talk to you about me or your father.

685
00:31:25,592 --> 00:31:29,052
New York. Iowa. Kansas.

686
00:31:29,178 --> 00:31:31,972
Forty states that all have
housing projects that will vanish

687
00:31:32,098 --> 00:31:34,892
if we don't find out information
that only you can help us get.

688
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:36,685
So, you can steal money
from your father's company,

689
00:31:36,811 --> 00:31:38,478
or you can blow the whistle
on me if you want to.

690
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:42,024
But if you really care about people
the way that you claim to,

691
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:44,109
you're going
to do this first.

692
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:49,865
Are we close?

693
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:52,576
I'm accessing the banks
through a server in China.

694
00:31:52,702 --> 00:31:54,995
Unless you'd rather me
use yours.

695
00:31:55,121 --> 00:31:56,580
Take your time.

696
00:31:56,706 --> 00:31:58,040
Done.

697
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:00,959
All right.
There are 16 banks in Liechtenstein.

698
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:03,462
This is every account
in every single one of them.

699
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:06,089
None of the accounts
is listed under Anthony Mazlo.

700
00:32:06,215 --> 00:32:07,174
Forget about the name.

701
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,842
Find an account with $150 million

702
00:32:08,968 --> 00:32:11,553
embezzled
from Stable Shelters on that date.

703
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:14,598
Harvey, it's time.

704
00:32:14,724 --> 00:32:18,352
Unless you have something,
I'm calling Lucille to settle.

705
00:32:18,478 --> 00:32:22,314
Jessica, you know how Liechtenstein
doesn't respond to subpoenas.

706
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,733
So I responded for them.
Just trust me.

707
00:32:25,234 --> 00:32:28,070
We've got everything we need
to find Lucille's money.

708
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:29,863
It's not here.

709
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:33,575
Sounds like you need more
than just another minute.

710
00:32:33,701 --> 00:32:35,077
You need another person.

711
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:37,412
Someone whose expertise
is financial crime.

712
00:32:37,538 --> 00:32:39,039
No. No.

713
00:32:39,165 --> 00:32:41,541
Harvey. Bring in Louis,

714
00:32:42,585 --> 00:32:44,336
or I'm calling Lucille.

715
00:32:56,724 --> 00:32:59,977
Donna? I need to talk to Louis.
He's not in his office.

716
00:33:00,103 --> 00:33:01,103
Huh.

717
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:02,437
Norma wouldn't tell you
where he is?

718
00:33:02,563 --> 00:33:05,357
Well, she didn't, um...

719
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:07,442
You didn't ask her,
did you?

720
00:33:07,568 --> 00:33:09,069
That woman...
She gives me the creeps.

721
00:33:09,195 --> 00:33:10,862
Oh, you're such a wuss.

722
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:11,905
What did you
just say to me?

723
00:33:12,031 --> 00:33:14,783
I think we both know
what I just said.

724
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,786
Norma, where is he?

725
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:20,080
What? You're kidding.

726
00:33:20,206 --> 00:33:21,748
- What?
- Shh.

727
00:33:34,762 --> 00:33:37,472
I come here
when I need to be alone.

728
00:33:37,598 --> 00:33:40,559
.44 Magnum? Really?

729
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:43,186
You feeling lucky today, punk?

730
00:33:43,312 --> 00:33:47,149
You know, I understand
that me pissing the bed on this case

731
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:49,901
must be really,
really fun for you.

732
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:52,863
No, Louis, it's not.

733
00:33:52,989 --> 00:33:56,700
The one thing you and I
have in common is we need to win.

734
00:33:57,827 --> 00:33:59,244
I noticed that.

735
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:02,205
And I came here because,
even after everything,

736
00:34:02,331 --> 00:34:03,540
we can win.

737
00:34:03,666 --> 00:34:05,167
No.

738
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:08,253
I can watch while you win.

739
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:11,673
Louis,
I'm not here to give you shit.

740
00:34:11,799 --> 00:34:13,383
Listen. I respect you.

741
00:34:13,509 --> 00:34:15,010
I bribed a witness.

742
00:34:15,136 --> 00:34:16,219
You incentivized her.

743
00:34:16,345 --> 00:34:17,721
I went to see Perkins' widow.

744
00:34:17,847 --> 00:34:19,014
To apologize.

745
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:20,891
I killed a man.

746
00:34:21,017 --> 00:34:22,976
That you thought
had it coming.

747
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:26,646
I don't think you heard
what I said.

748
00:34:26,773 --> 00:34:28,315
I respect you.

749
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:33,987
You need my help.

750
00:34:34,822 --> 00:34:36,948
I wouldn't phrase it
exactly like that.

751
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:39,034
Well, if you need my help,

752
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,911
you better phrase it
exactly like that.

753
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:42,954
Okay, you want me to say it?
I'll say it.

754
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:45,123
I'm under the gun
and I need your help.

755
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:46,792
I've got
the information,

756
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:49,419
but you've got the financial expertise
to break this case.

757
00:34:49,545 --> 00:34:51,797
Now, let's put the gun down
and go get him.

758
00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:56,134
Okay.

759
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,719
First, just stand over there
for a second.

760
00:34:57,845 --> 00:34:59,137
Don't push it.

761
00:35:08,606 --> 00:35:09,815
So, what was the exact amount of money

762
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:11,483
that was lost
from Stable Shelters' account?

763
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:17,030
- Why?
- $152,375,242.18

764
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:22,494
I'm good with numbers.

765
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,037
Huh.

766
00:35:24,497 --> 00:35:25,789
All right. What do you have?

767
00:35:26,207 --> 00:35:27,958
We've compiled a printout
of every account

768
00:35:28,084 --> 00:35:29,918
that had a deposit made
on the day in question

769
00:35:30,044 --> 00:35:32,629
in all of Liechtenstein's
16 banks.

770
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:36,049
Okay.
Well, we are going to focus on,

771
00:35:36,175 --> 00:35:37,259
excuse me,

772
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:39,594
these five banks.

773
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,471
How can you be sure?

774
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:42,764
Watch this.

775
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:46,309
These four banks have a history
of capitulating to subpoenas

776
00:35:46,435 --> 00:35:47,769
so Mazlo would know.

777
00:35:47,895 --> 00:35:50,480
These six have
US corporate parents,

778
00:35:50,606 --> 00:35:52,983
which would expose their accounts
to federal scrutiny.

779
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:55,026
Once again, Mazlo would know.

780
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:57,612
And then, the one that he's got
right there is low in reserves.

781
00:35:57,738 --> 00:35:59,447
Therefore,
its solvency is in question.

782
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:02,659
And there is no way in hell
that Mazlo would take his stolen money

783
00:36:02,785 --> 00:36:05,287
and put it
into some shaky bank.

784
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:07,622
So, we can be sure.

785
00:36:07,748 --> 00:36:10,834
Every person who embezzles money,
they do it in their own way.

786
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,669
But the one thing
that they all have in common

787
00:36:12,795 --> 00:36:14,963
is that they never put
all their eggs in one basket.

788
00:36:15,089 --> 00:36:17,591
So we are going to be looking
at a combination of accounts.

789
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:19,634
- Across banks.
- Well, I mean, maybe across banks.

790
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,594
Maybe the same bank.

791
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,012
But we're definitely looking
at more than one account.

792
00:36:22,138 --> 00:36:24,222
Ooh. How do we figure out
which accounts are his?

793
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:26,224
Because they're all going to add up
to the same exact amount of money

794
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:28,185
that was lost from
Stable Shelters' account.

795
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:29,186
Well, how do you know?

796
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:31,438
When the account was drained,
it had to go somewhere.

797
00:36:31,564 --> 00:36:34,399
What goes out from Lucille's
had to go into Mazlo's.

798
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:35,817
Simple law of mathematics.

799
00:36:35,943 --> 00:36:38,111
So, we just have to figure out
a combination of accounts

800
00:36:38,237 --> 00:36:43,283
- that adds up to...
- $152,375,242.18.

801
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:45,452
I'm good with
numbers, too.

802
00:36:55,254 --> 00:36:56,922
Thanks for meeting us
on such short notice.

803
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:58,673
I assume you're ready
to take our offer.

804
00:36:58,799 --> 00:36:59,758
I rushed right down.

805
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:02,177
Well, we just have a few questions
before we get to any of that.

806
00:37:02,303 --> 00:37:03,428
We didn't agree to answer
any questions.

807
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:05,847
No, no, Robert. It's okay.
I'm happy to play.

808
00:37:07,433 --> 00:37:10,101
Have you ever been to Liechtenstein,
Mr. Mazlo?

809
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:12,229
You know,
I've been to many places.

810
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:14,397
Among them Liechtenstein.

811
00:37:14,523 --> 00:37:16,483
Really?
Well, of those many places,

812
00:37:16,609 --> 00:37:18,610
did you open
seven different bank accounts,

813
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:20,779
the amounts of which add up
to exactly the same amount of money

814
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:23,490
that disappeared from
Lucille Jackson's endowment fund?

815
00:37:23,616 --> 00:37:24,699
I doubt it.

816
00:37:24,825 --> 00:37:28,578
What I don't doubt is that if you trace
the money that went into those accounts,

817
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:31,665
you'll find that it came
from our corporate offices in Sri Lanka.

818
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:33,291
It's completely legitimate.

819
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:36,586
I mean, I'm happy to show you
the records, whenever you'd like.

820
00:37:36,712 --> 00:37:38,213
Oh, that's great.

821
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:41,466
Isn't that great? Well, after that,
can you show us the records

822
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:43,009
of the seven safety deposit boxes

823
00:37:43,135 --> 00:37:45,845
that you opened
at those same banks the same day?

824
00:37:54,313 --> 00:37:55,397
I don't
have to answer that.

825
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:56,690
This isn't a deposition.

826
00:37:56,816 --> 00:37:58,900
You're so right.
It's more of a presentation.

827
00:37:59,026 --> 00:38:00,068
We can make it a deposition.

828
00:38:00,194 --> 00:38:01,861
- Or a trial.
- Up to you.

829
00:38:01,988 --> 00:38:04,906
We have pictures of you
entering those banks.

830
00:38:05,032 --> 00:38:07,492
And we have enough
to crack their subpoenas.

831
00:38:07,618 --> 00:38:10,036
It's just a matter of time, Tony.

832
00:38:13,749 --> 00:38:14,874
All right.
What do you want?

833
00:38:15,001 --> 00:38:17,043
What do I want?
Well, it's not about me.

834
00:38:17,169 --> 00:38:19,045
It's about Lucille.
She wants your head on a stick.

835
00:38:19,171 --> 00:38:20,672
But she'll settle
for her money back.

836
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:22,716
And your resignation.

837
00:38:25,511 --> 00:38:28,555
We agree right here,
no criminal prosecution.

838
00:38:33,686 --> 00:38:34,894
Done.

839
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:38,106
If Lucille doesn't get
her money back today,

840
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:41,234
nothing's done.

841
00:38:50,536 --> 00:38:52,078
Great. That's perfect.

842
00:38:52,204 --> 00:38:54,748
You are back in business.
The wire transfer just went through.

843
00:38:54,874 --> 00:38:57,083
Girl. You came through.

844
00:38:57,209 --> 00:38:59,002
That is what we do.

845
00:38:59,128 --> 00:39:01,588
Harvey? Harvey, get in here.

846
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:03,965
Lucille wants to thank you
in person.

847
00:39:04,091 --> 00:39:06,343
I've always got time
for gratitude.

848
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:07,969
Harvey,
you didn't let me settle,

849
00:39:08,095 --> 00:39:09,763
and I appreciate
your tenacity.

850
00:39:09,889 --> 00:39:11,473
The truth is,
I didn't do this on my own.

851
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:12,515
Have you met Louis Litt?

852
00:39:12,641 --> 00:39:15,352
You guys are doing such good work.
I just want you to know it.

853
00:39:15,478 --> 00:39:17,562
Dean Waiser, have I told you
how valuable you are to this company?

854
00:39:17,688 --> 00:39:19,731
Because you're not.
Just kidding.

855
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:22,942
Janice. I want you to take the rest
of the day off because you're so good.

856
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:23,902
And I really mean it.

857
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:25,612
Harold. 9:30.

858
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:28,531
Tequila shots, you and me, sharp.
Be there.

859
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:44,005
Louis. Luis.

860
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,508
- What's up?
- What were you just doing in there?

861
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:50,637
- What? I was just...
- Let me guess. You were cutting me out.

862
00:39:50,763 --> 00:39:51,679
What are you talking about?

863
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:53,598
The little impromptu meeting
you just had with Jessica and Lucille

864
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:55,016
that you conveniently
left me out of.

865
00:39:55,142 --> 00:39:56,851
- I didn't leave you out of anything.
- Man, I thought we were a team.

866
00:39:56,977 --> 00:39:58,311
I thought this was
the start of something. But I...

867
00:39:58,437 --> 00:40:01,648
- Louis...
- Now, I see the truth all too clearly.

868
00:40:01,774 --> 00:40:04,776
Louis. I was walking by
and they called me in.

869
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:07,612
Yeah. Just in time
to take the credit for what I did.

870
00:40:08,781 --> 00:40:10,448
I didn't do that.

871
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:12,659
I wouldn't even think
of doing that.

872
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:15,161
But you know what?
You would.

873
00:40:15,287 --> 00:40:17,163
And that's your problem
right there.

874
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:37,517
I got your email
about Mazlo.

875
00:40:37,643 --> 00:40:40,437
Not a bad way
for Locksley LLC to go out.

876
00:40:40,563 --> 00:40:42,355
Looks like the firm
owes you one.

877
00:40:42,481 --> 00:40:44,482
I think you owe me one.

878
00:40:51,657 --> 00:40:53,158
Whoa.

879
00:40:54,076 --> 00:40:55,410
Uh...

880
00:40:55,536 --> 00:40:57,245
- Is this...
- The real thing?

881
00:40:57,371 --> 00:40:58,538
Yeah.

882
00:40:58,664 --> 00:41:00,915
I told the Dean's office
you'd lost yours.

883
00:41:01,041 --> 00:41:04,669
They were happy to oblige
for one of their top graduates.

884
00:41:05,045 --> 00:41:08,590
I don't know if you're awesome
or terrifying.

885
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:11,801
Also, I added a layer
of protection for you.

886
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:21,144
Uh, the Harvard Law School
alumni database.

887
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:26,441
It's all there.
Your name, class rank,

888
00:41:26,567 --> 00:41:27,942
Social Security number.

889
00:41:28,068 --> 00:41:31,654
You do realize you've just
made me party to a crime, right?

890
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:34,491
You can always call them up.
Report it as a glitch.

891
00:41:34,617 --> 00:41:37,202
Let me guess. Untraceable.

892
00:41:37,953 --> 00:41:39,621
I'm not saying
you won't get caught.

893
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:42,832
But it won't be because
your story doesn't check.

894
00:41:46,378 --> 00:41:47,962
Hey. Um...

895
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:51,382
Thank you. Seriously.

896
00:41:52,426 --> 00:41:54,093
You were right.

897
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:55,553
I'm working things out
with my dad.

898
00:41:57,848 --> 00:42:01,184
You're not the empty suit
I thought you were.

899
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:09,526
Who was that?

900
00:42:09,652 --> 00:42:11,819
Uh, client's daughter.

901
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:15,198
Really? It's kind of late. What's she
doing at the office at this hour?

902
00:42:15,324 --> 00:42:18,201
You know,
she was just thanking me.

903
00:42:18,327 --> 00:42:19,494
- Thanking you.
- Mmm-hmm.

904
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:21,788
How did she do that?

905
00:42:21,914 --> 00:42:23,414
Easily.

906
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:25,458
She bought me
two plane tickets to Greece.

907
00:42:25,584 --> 00:42:26,834
Not interested.

908
00:42:26,961 --> 00:42:28,044
We leave Tuesday.
