Gina! Carina!

Gina! Carina!

[man]<i> Hello, Winston, this is Operations.</i>

9
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,960
<i>-Are you hearing me?</i>
-Hear you clearly.

10
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,600
<i>Stand by for testing.</i>

11
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:09,120
-Testing now.
<i>-Testing five, four, three, two, one.</i>

[dogs bark]

13
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,760
Mummy.

14
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,960
I've come to make a final representation.

15
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:30,880
And to beseech you not to do this.

16
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,960
I wish to address my people.
It's my right.

17
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:36,880
You have forfeited that right.

18
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,480
There are things I wish to say.

19
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,720
In which capacity?
You're no longer their king.

20
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,160
As a private individual.

21
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,800
Oh, no one wants to hear
from a private individual.

22
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:48,440
Well, I beg to differ.
The newspapers are for me.

23
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:51,600
The best thing for everyone
would be if you said your goodbyes

24
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,800
quietly, privately,
and disappeared into the night.

25
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,680
Preferably never to return.

26
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,440
-I didn't say that.
-But you thought it.

27
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,480
Admit it.

28
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,840
Elizabeth! Margaret! Come inside!

29
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:21,080
[man on radio]<i> This is Windsor Castle.</i>

30
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:25,280
<i>There follows an important announcement</i>
<i>from his Royal Highness,</i>

31
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,640
<i>the Duke of Windsor.</i>

32
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:31,600
A few hours ago, I discharged my last duty

33
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,920
as King and Emperor.

34
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,960
And, now that I have been succeeded
by my brother,

35
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,680
the Duke of York,

36
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:48,200
my first words must be to declare
my allegiance to him.

37
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,640
This I do with all my heart.

38
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,120
-[girls laugh]
-Come along, girls.

39
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,640
<i>You all know the reasons which have</i>
<i>impelled me to renounce the throne.</i>

40
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:02,000
<i>-I have found it impossible to carry...</i>
-Girls. Girls!

41
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:07,760
<i>...the heavy burden of responsibility,</i>
<i>and to discharge my duties as King,</i>

42
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,720
as I would wish to do,

43
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:17,280
without the help and support
of the woman I love.

44
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,120
<i>This decision has been made less difficult</i>
<i>to me by the sure knowledge</i>

45
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:25,080
<i>that my brother</i>
<i>has one matchless blessing...</i>

46
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:28,920
-Come in. Both of you.
<i>-...enjoyed by so many of you,</i>

47
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
<i>and not bestowed on me.</i>

48
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:36,400
<i>A happy home, with his wife and children.</i>

49
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,000
<i>And now we all have a new king.</i>

50
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:48,160
<i>I wish him, and you, his people,</i>
<i>happiness and prosperity...</i>

51
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,360
<i>with all my heart.</i>

52
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,120
<i>God bless you all.</i>

53
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,760
<i>God save the King.</i>

[vacuum cleaner running]

56
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,640
All right, Charles, all right. Stop it.

57
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:20,040
Well... good luck, darling.

58
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,240
Thank you.

59
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,920
And thank you for all this.
It looks splendid.

60
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,760
This is the first proper home
I've ever had.

61
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,080
[cameras click]

62
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,640
-Tommy.
-Good morning, Your Majesty.

63
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,880
-You tracked me down.
-Slightly, ma'am.

64
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,600
If Your Majesty has no objection,

65
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,600
I thought we might attend
to the Cabinet papers

66
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,720
after your meeting with Their Majesties.
Your schedule allows for 20 minutes.

67
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,400
-For the papers?
-No, ma'am,

68
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:04,960
20 minutes with Their Majesties,
then directly on to the paperwork.

69
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,400
And then?

70
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:10,920
Things will become more manageable
once everything settles down.

71
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,840
Will it?

72
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:15,200
And once the Palace
is your main residence.

73
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:21,160
[Norfolk] Our understanding is that he is
arriving at Southampton as we speak.

74
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,360
-[Queen Mary] Alone?
-We believe so, ma'am.

75
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,480
Hm. That's something.

76
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:33,800
[Norfolk] Some last minute adjustments
to the funeral arrangements.

77
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:37,360
If you are in agreement, ma'am,
we thought that the Duke of Windsor

78
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,480
should join the Dukes of Gloucester,
Kent and Edinburgh.

79
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:44,240
But that'd be the row behind me.
Breathing down my neck.

80
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,880
We could, if Her Majesty likes,
increase the distance,

81
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,480
put him back a few rows.

82
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,120
Any chance that could stretch
to being on the steps outside the chapel?

83
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,600
I'm sorry, I know he's your son.

84
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:58,720
A son who gave up the throne
and, effectively, killed my other son.

85
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Why not put him there?
Close to the Prime Minister?

86
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
-Thank you, ma'am.
-Cry Baby.

87
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,080
-What?
-It's what he calls Winston.

88
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:21,560
He and his wife have
nasty little nicknames for all of us.

89
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,400
I'll tell you yours, if you ask me nicely.

90
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,040
No, thank you.

91
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,880
Shirley Temple.

92
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:38,200

[ship horn blaring]

94
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,400
Ready, sir.

95
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:09,040
[Duke of Windsor]<i> This is indeed</i>
<i>a sad arrival in my country.</i>

96
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:16,000
<i>I have crossed the Atlantic</i>
<i>for the funeral of a dear brother,</i>

97
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:19,400
<i>and to comfort Her Majesty, Queen Mary.</i>

98
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,480
My heart goes out
to the widowed Queen Mother

99
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,960
and her two daughters in their grief.

100
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,640
Thank you.

101
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,360
[crowd shouting]

102
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,840
-Down there, look!
-Right, that's enough. Look sharp!

103
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,000
His Royal Highness,
the Duke of Windsor, Your Majesty.

104
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,280
Dear Mama.

105
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,640
Poor Bertie.

106
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,440
So young.

107
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,280
One can only be thankful
for all the years one had him.

108
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,240
So wonderfully thoughtful and caring.

109
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:32,880
An angel to his mother, wife and children.

110
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,160
I honestly believe
he never thought of himself at all.

111
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:43,400
He really was the perfect son.

112
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:49,400
I can't imagine how difficult
it must be for you.

113
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:54,040
You've been very much
in our thoughts and prayers.

114
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,320
Ours?

115
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,240
You'd be wise not to mention
that woman's name for the next few days.

116
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:02,080
-I mentioned no name.
-The implication was enough.

117
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,680
If you say so.

118
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:07,160
I offer that in the spirit
of maternal advice

119
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:11,720
that you may emerge from this trip with
any remaining respect or affection at all.

120
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,480
I had hoped all this might wait.

121
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,960
I'm afraid not, ma'am.

122
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,040
I understand.

123
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,800
Shall we?

124
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:59,560
Now, the top sheet is simply a summary
of all the contents of the box.

125
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:03,840
And we have in this case,
a five power conference first. See...

126
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,800
-That's this one?
-Yes.

127
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:08,440
-So this...
-More detail.

128
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,960
-So, we start with this.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

129
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:14,640
[conversation continues indistinctly]

130
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,560
-[Philip] He's here.
-He's here!

131
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:38,600
Don't rush, darling. It'll take him
an hour to get to the front door.

132
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,720
And then an hour to get through
the bloody thing!

133
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,200
Now, don't forget
the two things we discussed.

134
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,240
-I won't.
-The children keeping my surname.

135
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,320
-Yes.
-And us staying here in Clarence House,

136
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,840
not moving to Buckingham Palace.
Both very important.

137
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,000
I know. I won't forget.

138
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,920
-And don't be nervous.
-I'm not nervous.

139
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,040
You look nervous.

140
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,600
Be firm. Just lay down the law.

141
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:03,400
I know he's Winston Churchill
and all that, but remember who you are.

142
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,360
-You're--
-Nobody.

143
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,800
The Queen of England.

144
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,400
[toy horn honks]

145
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,880
[Churchill] Don't let me overrun.

146
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,640
[man] The Prime Minister, Your Majesty.

147
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,000
Your Majesty.

148
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:55,000
I so looked forward every Tuesday
to my audiences with your...

149
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,840
dear papa.

150
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:02,840
His late Majesty was a hero

151
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,600
to me and to all his people.

152
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,240
Thank you.

153
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:14,120
Do sit down, Prime Minister.

154
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:19,360
I've ordered tea.
Or something stronger, perhaps.

155
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,800
Oh, dear. Did no one explain?

156
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:28,800
The Sovereign never offers
a Prime Minister refreshment.

157
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,760
Nor a chair.

158
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:33,520
The precedent set
by your great-great-grandmother

159
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,920
was to keep us standing
like Privy Councillors.

160
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,600
To waste time is a grievous sin.

161
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,720
And, if there is one thing I have learned
in 52 years of public service,

162
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:50,600
it is that there is no problem so complex,
nor crisis so grave,

163
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:56,680
that it cannot be satisfactorily resolved
within 20 minutes. So...

164
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,160
shall we make a start?

165
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,760
[Philip]<i> She's in with the PM now.</i>

166
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,880
And I made it abundantly clear
how important it was

167
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,600
that she and the children take your name.

168
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:13,640
[Lord Mountbatten]<i> It's your name too.</i>
<i>It's the name I gave you.</i>

169
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:20,280
Having Mountbatten
as the name of the Royal house,

170
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:25,480
having your first-born son, Charles,
as the first Mountbatten king...

171
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:29,200
<i>Well, that would be some achievement,</i>
<i>wouldn't it?</i>

172
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:34,600
Now, I would like to discuss
your coronation.

173
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,560
Yes.

174
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:39,440
I have a proposed date which has been
run past Cabinet and approved.

175
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:44,600
-Summer, I hope.
-Indeed. Next year.

176
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,720
Next year? Why the delay?

177
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,840
For your benefit entirely.

178
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:55,480
A long period
between accession and coronation

179
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,960
was of great value to your father.

180
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:00,600
He had five months.

181
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:04,400
You're proposing I have 16
before I am crowned.

182
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,720
Yes.

183
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:14,760
[man] That would take anyone
weeks to read...

184
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:18,960
-Anyway, thanks for the drink.
-Thank you, Jock.

185
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,440
-Sir.
-Sir.

186
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:26,200
Foreign office first,
let's surprise Anthony.

187
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,480
-[Philip] And?
-Nothing.

188
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:35,840
We discussed the end of rationing
of sugar, butter and meat,

189
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:39,360
the situation in Korea,
and the date of my coronation.

190
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,560
I barely got a word in.

191
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,560
Of course not,
the man barely draws breath.

192
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,920
-You have to butt in.
-You can't!

193
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,880
Not in the private audience.

194
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,080
So, what about the issues
I asked you to address?

195
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,480
-I will find the right time.
-When?

196
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,360
-Why would he do that?
-What?

197
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,960
Why would he want to delay my coronation?

198
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:00,560
What are you talking about? What--
Elizabeth!

199
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,120
[telephone rings in distance]

200
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,120
[doors close]

201
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:31,640
I realize we've had our differences
in the past.

202
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,880
If you'll allow me.

203
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:41,520
But, for now, let us think only
of what we have in common.

204
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:47,880
You've lost a husband and father,

205
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,400
I a brother.

206
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:58,880
Let us be united in grief,
on equal terms, for someone we all loved.

207
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:04,760
I'll be here for a few days
after the funeral

208
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,760
before I return to New York.

209
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:11,440
Perhaps we might find time
to see one another.

210
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,760
For lunch, or a walk.

211
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,360
Yes. I'd like that very much.

212
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,680
[door opens]

213
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,760
Your Majesties.

214
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:32,120
-[Queen Mother] We must go, girls.
-So soon?

215
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,440
Yes, to Westminster Hall.

216
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,040
To see Papa.

217
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:52,680
With this family, when you're in,
you're never quite sure that you're in.

218
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:55,400
But when you're out,
there's no doubt at all.

219
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,000
You're out.

220
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,040
[sobs]

221
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,400
Why can't you just be civil to him, Mummy?

222
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:08,240
Let bygones be bygones.

223
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:12,240
Sixteen years since the abdication,
and he was close to Papa.

224
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,800
Because the man is a monster!

225
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,480
The responsibility of becoming king
killed your father

226
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:22,520
and I will never forgive his selfishness
and weakness in passing on the burden.

227
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:28,880
He has done nothing for this family.

228
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,120
And don't be fooled by his obsequiousness.

229
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,680
The only reason he's even civil to us
is because he wants to leech off us

230
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:40,160
with a rich allowance to keep
that Jezebel divorcee of his in the manner

231
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,720
to which she's become accustomed.

232
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,440
Well, I've spoken to the lawyers

233
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,320
and we have a little surprise
in store for them.

234
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,160
[Duke of Windsor]
<i>My dear darling Peaches...</i>

235
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,600
<i>They say hell is an inferno.</i>

236
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:59,560
<i>What a sunless, frozen hell</i>
<i>we both escaped in England.</i>

237
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:05,320
<i>And what a bunch of ice-veined monsters</i>
<i>my family are.</i>

238
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,480
<i>How cold and thin-lipped,</i>

239
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:11,000
<i>how dumpy and plain.</i>

240
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:13,480
<i>How joyless and loveless.</i>

241
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:19,400
<i>The way Cookie treated me looking</i>
<i>down at me through her dumpy nose,</i>

242
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:23,880
<i>it was as much as I could do</i>
<i>not to let her have it with both barrels.</i>

243
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,880
<i>And Shirley Temple,</i>
<i>who has the rank now</i>

244
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:29,720
<i>to silence her common mother,</i>
<i>sadly, has no mind of her own.</i>

245
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,160
<i>But I remained civil</i>
<i>because I am following your advice...</i>

246
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:42,000
<i>to keep them on side,</i>
<i>keep a foot in the door...</i>

247
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:46,200
<i>and see what we can get out</i>
<i>of the wretched circus.</i>

248
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:53,640
<i>Perhaps even a raise on the allowance,</i>
<i>who knows?</i>

249
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:58,880
<i>It's the only revenge I can think of</i>
<i>for the insult of your non-invitation,</i>

250
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:02,520
<i>to drain their coffers to our benefit.</i>

251
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:06,720
[mechanical clunking]

252
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,360
<i>Thinking always of you</i>

253
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:17,040
<i>and counting the minutes</i>
<i>until I am back in your arms.</i>

254
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,600
<i>Your loving David.</i>

255
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:23,480
...and therefore commit his body
to the ground.

256
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:31,280
Earth to earth,
ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

257
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:37,600
In sure and certain hope
of the resurrection to eternal life,

258
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:40,880
through our Lord Jesus Christ.

259
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:54,240
-[gunshots]
-[dogs barking]

260
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:18,800
-What is that thing?
-Oh, I inherited it from my grandfather.

261
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:22,600
Well, as you know, Kaiser Wilhelm
was not blessed with a normal physique.

262
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:25,000
No, the withered arm.

263
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:28,640
Ah, but he loved to shoot,
so modifications had to be made.

264
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,960
[laughs]

265
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:36,240
They didn't modify a shotgun,
they modified a cannon.

266
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:39,440
[gunshots continue]

267
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,400
You are a cheat, Hannover.

268
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:55,200
[Mountbatten]<i> I realize that,</i>
<i>beyond these walls, the country mourns,</i>

269
00:24:55,280 --> 00:25:00,520
struggles under a program
of austerity and rationing

270
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:03,240
but, what to do?

271
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:06,200
It might all appear indulgent

272
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:10,960
but, in keeping the estate
and the local community going,

273
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:14,800
we are all doing our share tonight
for the economy.

274
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:15,880
[chuckling]

275
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:18,320
So, let us start with a toast.

276
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:27,440
-To His late Majesty, the King.
-[all] The King.

277
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:34,520
-And, the Queen that has succeeded him.
-[all] The Queen.

278
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,960
And to our generous host.

279
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:39,640
And the Royal house
that is now in his name.

280
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:42,320
[all] To our host and the Royal house.

281
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:47,320
-To the Royal house Mountbatten.
-[all] To the Royal house Mountbatten.

282
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,360
[airplane overhead]

283
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,560
[Philip] Right, come on, then.
You can do it.

284
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:58,880
Kick it back.

285
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,800
Kick it back, boy. Go on.

286
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:08,920
-It's not going to bite you. Kick it.
-[Parker] Ah, it's a Burnley centre back.

287
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,720
Tell me,
do you play football with your boy?

288
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:14,440
-When I get to see him, yeah. Rugby.
-Rugby? Chance'd be a fine thing.

289
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:16,840
This one doesn't seem to want
to do anything but dream.

290
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:20,440
Ah. Your old man struggling a bit, is he?

291
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,200
Well, come on then.
Show him how it's done.

292
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:25,640
Right. Come on then, Charles.
Let's give you something to aim at.

293
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,800
That thing's been buzzing around
all morning.

294
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,520
[whispers] Right between his trousers.

295
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,960
Yup. Taking aerial photographs
for some magazine.

296
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:38,080
-Oh, is that right?
-Mm-hm.

297
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,080
It was always my dream
to join the Air Force.

298
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,000
But Dickie put me in the Navy.

299
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,160
He felt the social connections
would be better.

300
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:52,640
Hm. Judging by where you ended up,
I'd say the plan worked.

301
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:56,720
-Ha.
-[whispers] Come on, Charles. Bash it.

302
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,000
[gasps]

303
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:01,480
Not bloody bad, Charles. Not bloody bad.

304
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:04,240
-No, Daddy, not in the bushes!
-In the bushes he goes!

305
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,120
[laughter]

306
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:09,280
No, Daddy! Not the bushes!

307
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:14,520
Right, Charlie Boy, here we go.
I'm going to teach you...

308
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,360
Come on, then!

309
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,240
[bell dings]

310
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,000
[Duke of Windsor]<i> Oh, it's vile.</i>

311
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:01,560
Tommy Lascelles comes up to me
at the funeral, of all places,

312
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:06,160
asks me for a word then tells me,
to my face, "Do you credit it?"

313
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:10,080
I come all this way,
back to this gaping wound of a country,

314
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:14,640
forbidden to bring my own wife,
to pay respects to my dear, late brother

315
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:18,800
and they compound an already traumatic
and painful trip with this humiliation!

316
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,880
The timing does seem
particularly unfortunate.

317
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,360
It's an outrage!

318
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:28,480
-How much is the allowance?
-Ten thousand a year.

319
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:31,520
The agreement between Bertie and me
was that I would give up everything

320
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:35,480
and go into exile and keep a low profile
in return for a pension

321
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:39,440
that was clearly meant to be
for the term of my whole life, not his!

322
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:42,600
Now he's barely cold
and Cookie turns off the bloody tap!

323
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:45,720
-How dare she?
-You don't know that it was her.

324
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:48,280
-Of course it was her.
-And don't call her that.

325
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:51,040
Why not?
She's fat, common, and looks like a cook.

326
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,480
Did they offer any justification?

327
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:59,320
Oh, that it would appear insensitive
for a member of the extended Royal family

328
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:02,440
to be seen to be rewarded
and live in luxury.

329
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:04,040
Extended Royal family!

330
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:07,360
I was the most senior member
of that family. The King!

331
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,720
Now, we barely make ends meet!
Every day is a struggle.

332
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:14,800
You live in great style
from what I've heard.

333
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:18,440
Perhaps you should take a leaf
out of your late brother's book.

334
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:23,240
-He was frugal, you know.
-He was born frugal. In every department.

335
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:27,120
And that frugality
earned him great favour.

336
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,680
And he passed it on
to the women in his family.

337
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,480
Who just spent 70,000
renovating Clarence House,

338
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:35,800
so no lectures, please,
about the frugality of the new Queen.

339
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:38,800
-That was her husband.
-What, the foundling?

340
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,120
-Don't call him that.
-Why not?

341
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:44,720
I'd call him by his name, if he had one.

342
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,520
[door opens]

343
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:53,320
His Royal Highness, Prince Ernst August
of Hanover, Your Majesty.

344
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,200
-He's here.
-What?

345
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:59,360
He apologizes for the lack of warning,
but said it was important.

346
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,440
[sighs] All right.
You'd better show him in.

347
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,000
Ah...

348
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:16,880
[in German]
Dear Aunt, forgive the intrusion.

349
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,800
I come directly from Broadlands.

350
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,720
[in German]
What were you doing there?

351
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:24,120
[in English] Please tell me you weren't
shooting, one day after the funeral.

352
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:28,640
-Oh, <i>meine liebe</i> Ernst.
-I assure you the sport was very limited.

353
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:32,360
And your late son was in our thoughts
the whole time.

354
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:35,920
Anyway, in the evening,
we gathered for dinner.

355
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,600
The food is normally quite good
at Broadlands.

356
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:41,760
-Outstanding!
-Especially the duck, from memory.

357
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,360
-With oranges.
-Rum-soaked raisins.

358
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:46,680
Oh! A Prussian recipe.

359
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:50,640
[in German] Spaetzle, too. Remarkable!
Crispy, with cheese and breadcrumbs.

360
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,960
-Mmm. Delicious!
-[in English] Go on.

361
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:59,240
Yes.
So, after dinner, our host started to brag

362
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:02,360
about how the Royal house
would soon be in his name.

363
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,880
Nonsense.

364
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:07,880
The Royal Warrant of 1917
established the House of Windsor.

365
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:11,000
-Ah.
-My late husband presided over it himself.

366
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:15,080
But the name Windsor would only be carried
by the male descendants.

367
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:18,560
It did not take into account
the female descendants.

368
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,400
They would take the name
from their husbands

369
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,680
-which, in this case, would mean--
-Mountbatten!

370
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:25,000
Well...

371
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:29,560
-He had us raising glasses to it.
-Glasses containing what?

372
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:34,800
-Champagne.
-You were drinking champagne

373
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:39,000
the day after my son's funeral?

374
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:57,520
[Townsend] Come in.

375
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,320
[sighs]

376
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,680
I had to see you.

377
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:09,480
Come in.

378
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:19,480
I got home last night
to find this on the kitchen table.

379
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,880
She's gone.

380
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,000
All her belongings have gone.

381
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:46,480
I'm so sorry.

382
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,400
No, you're not.

383
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,160
No.

384
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:54,160
I'm not.

385
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:32,720
-So, will you sue her for divorce?
-No, I'd lose my job.

386
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:35,320
Well, you'll keep your job.
I'll make sure of that.

387
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,800
It would make me a divorcee.

388
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,400
But not the guilty party.

389
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:52,520
Still, I'd be soiled goods.
I'd be tainted with scandal.

390
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,520
[whispers] You'd also be free.

391
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,400
To remarry.

392
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:06,800
One day.

393
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:10,600
Yes.

394
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:18,920
[man] Down there, please.

395
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,960
Christ. Hide. There, there. There. Go.

396
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:28,240
[voices approaching]

397
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:32,880
-Is it this one?
-Yeah, I think so.

398
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,280
-No, no, it's not. It's this one.
-Right.

399
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:37,640
Come in.

400
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:40,440
Sorry to barge in.
Have you got a second?

401
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:41,560
-Of course, sir.
-May I?

402
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:42,520
Please.

403
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,720
That's what I want to talk to you about.

404
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:50,560
-Flying.
-Yes, sir.

405
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:52,800
You're an experienced air jockey
and I've an idea.

406
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:55,560
And, look,
please disavow me of it if I'm wrong

407
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:59,800
but, to be up there in a plane,
it's the biggest thrill of them all.

408
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:03,880
-It is, sir.
-I mean, really. The biggest.

409
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,080
It is, sir.

410
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:13,240
Once you break through the clouds to
the clear blue beyond, the space, the...

411
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:18,800
the silence, the transcendent beauty,

412
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:22,880
it's church for the irreligious man.

413
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:25,960
That's what I'd hoped you'd say.
Where could I learn?

414
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:28,880
Uh... White Waltham Airfield,
they've a good school there.

415
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,400
-Would you take me?
-Of course, sir.

416
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,800
Good man.

417
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:37,920
You know, my sister,
my favourite sister actually,

418
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,160
Cecile, died in a plane.

419
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:44,200
It went down over Ostend in a storm.

420
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,960
Eight months pregnant.

421
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:50,840
She went into labour mid-flight
and they found the child,

422
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,880
next to her in the wreckage.

423
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,760
A boy.

424
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:02,960
Mm.

425
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,960
Mm.

426
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:22,040
New part of the uniform, Peter?

427
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:25,560
[sighs]

428
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,000
Anyone we know?

429
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:33,360
[chuckles] I... no.

430
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,800
[laughs]

431
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:37,080
No, quite right. None of my business.

432
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:39,520
Thank you, sir.

433
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:43,680
[both laugh]

434
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,160
[exhales]

435
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:55,160
[laughs]

436
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:56,880
You're enjoying this, aren't you?

437
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,360
[laughs]

438
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,160
Yes.

439
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,600
Mr. Colville, Your Majesty.

440
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:13,080
Your Majesties. Tommy.

441
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:16,280
[Queen Mary] Come in, Jock. Take a seat.

442
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:20,880
We have a significant concern
which we'd like to convey

443
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,800
to the Prime Minister.

444
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:26,520
It concerns the Duke of Edinburgh.

445
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:41,360
[Churchill]<i> Ma'am, word has reached me</i>
<i>that it is your desire</i>

446
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:46,440
<i>that you and your children should keep</i>
<i>your husband's name, Mountbatten.</i>

447
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:48,920
It is.

448
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,720
Ma'am, you must not.
It would be a grave mistake.

449
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,840
Mountbatten was the adoptive name

450
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:58,600
your husband took
when he became a British citizen.

451
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:03,280
His real name...
you'll not need reminding,

452
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:07,240
was
Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderberg-Glucksberg

453
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:11,720
of the Royal houses of Denmark and Norway
and, latterly, of Greece!

454
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,920
I am an old man.

455
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:26,720
Many have questioned my relevance,
whether I still have something to offer.

456
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:30,320
In public life, the answer is, I have.

457
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:34,520
Which is to leave in place
a Sovereign prepared for office.

458
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:37,960
Equipped, armed for her duty.

459
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:46,360
Great things have happened to this country
under the sceptres of her queens

460
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:49,520
and you should be no exception.

461
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:53,760
Yes, I am Queen, but I am also a woman.

462
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:57,440
And a wife.

463
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:04,120
To a man whose pride and whose strength
were, in part, what attracted me to him.

464
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,440
I want to be in a successful marriage.

465
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:13,440
I would argue, stability under this roof
might even be in the national interest.

466
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,160
Had you considered that?

467
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:17,720
[sighs]

468
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:21,240
Very well. I will discuss it with Cabinet.

469
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:26,080
No.

470
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:33,000
You will inform the Cabinet,
Prime Minister.

471
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:38,440
That is the favour you will do me,

472
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,960
in return for one I'm already doing you.

473
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:54,200
I know your party wants you to resign
to make way for a younger man.

474
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,400
Mr. Eden.

475
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:02,720
I also know that no one
will bring up your resignation

476
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,640
while you are actively engaged
in planning the Coronation.

477
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:13,320
So, by delaying my investiture,
you are, in fact, holding onto power...

478
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:20,520
in which case, I would suggest
you are, somewhat, in my debt.

479
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:25,680
So, if... I agree to the delay,

480
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:32,200
perhaps you will consider supporting me
in the matter regarding my husband's name.

481
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:40,520
And perhaps you could also inform Cabinet

482
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:44,640
that my husband and I
intend to stay here at Clarence House.

483
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:47,320
-Why?
-It is our home.

484
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:51,200
It has just been refurbished
at great expense.

485
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:55,000
Buckingham Palace can still be
where official business is done

486
00:40:55,080 --> 00:41:01,840
but our home, our private family home,
will be Clarence House.

487
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:08,720
Very well.

488
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:32,160
[Elizabeth]
<i>He was a little surprised, I think.</i>

489
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,840
-[Philip]<i> Really?</i>
<i>-I dare express any view at all.</i>

490
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:37,000
Papa was always putty in his hands.

491
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:39,160
But I think one should start
as one means to continue.

492
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:43,160
-Absolutely. Put a marker down.
-Quite. Draw a line in the sand.

493
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:46,720
He said he'd put it to Cabinet
and I said there was nothing to discuss.

494
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:49,400
-Good for you.
-No, good for you.

495
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:51,760
-That's why I did it.
-Thank you.

496
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:58,520
[crowd booing]

497
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:11,800
[booing and shouting]

498
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:17,240
Your Royal Highness, thank you for coming.

499
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:20,760
Not at all, dear Winston. How can I help?

500
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:27,440
I took it to Cabinet and, as expected,
the answer was unanimous,

501
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:29,640
"No" to both matters.

502
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:32,520
Well, she won't like it,
neither the snub over the name

503
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:34,720
nor the move to Buckingham Palace.

504
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:39,200
It really is a most dreadful place,
cold, uninviting,

505
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:44,040
but it's the right thing, for the young
family and the children to live there.

506
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:47,960
It's the focal point,
it's the monarch's home.

507
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:54,640
-Do you want me to break it to her?
-That would be very kind.

508
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,400
It's the least I can do.

509
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:59,640
I've never forgotten the way
in which you defended me,

510
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:04,000
fought for me during that terrible time.

511
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:07,640
I still think no man
should be punished for love.

512
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:10,800
And I also believe I spoke for many
in the country when I defended you.

513
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:12,840
You're very kind.

514
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:21,600
If I were to help you
in this matter with her,

515
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:24,920
perhaps I could ask a favour in return?

516
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:28,240
Name it.

517
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:41,880
[door closes]

518
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:48,080
Put in a word with the young Queen
for my allowance to be reinstated.

519
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:50,560
She holds the purse strings now.

520
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:54,320
The family expect me
to turn down commercial opportunities,

521
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:57,560
yet cuts off my allowance
at the same time.

522
00:43:57,640 --> 00:43:59,800
Ten thousand pounds,

523
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:03,360
it's quite impossible
to make ends meet without it.

524
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:06,680
That a former King
should come to me begging...

525
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:10,480
Consider it done.

526
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:19,200
There is also a brief moment
before the Coronation

527
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:24,640
where you might also
mobilize Cabinet support

528
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:31,520
for the one other thing that has eluded me
and gnaws away at my heart.

529
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:33,480
What?

530
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:36,120
The appropriate title
for the woman I married.

531
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:38,640
-No, sir.
-Her Royal Highness.

532
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:41,640
She is, after all,
the wife of a former King.

533
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:47,440
She's also a woman who has three husbands
that still live and breathe.

534
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:50,920
It is her right, Winston.

535
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:55,440
I'm determined she shall have it.
I'm determined she is shown respect.

536
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:59,200
Will you fight for it?

537
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:00,560
-[sighs]
-One more time?

538
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:05,680
I have defended you so many times.
Each time to my cost and in vain.

539
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:10,480
[sighs] This love for her
has destroyed everything.

540
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:14,120
It is love, Winston.

541
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:16,680
Love.

542
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:20,880
The greatest thing on Earth.

543
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:31,640
[orchestral music playing]

544
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:16,560
[door opens]

545
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:19,280
[man] His Royal Highness
the Duke of Windsor, Your Majesty.

546
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:25,720
Your Majesty.

547
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:29,520
Thank you for seeing me.

548
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:32,080
Thank you for coming.

549
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:46,240
Well, most of the time we're in Paris.
We've been given a house there.

550
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:50,640
Wallis likes to entertain.
She's so good at it.

551
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:55,480
So the place is always full.
And we have dogs.

552
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:57,480
Oh, really? What kind?

553
00:48:57,560 --> 00:49:04,520
Pugs. Davy Crockett, Trooper and Disraeli.

554
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:09,280
-Why pugs? What's the attraction?
-Well, they're... childlike.

555
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:13,720
-Need a lot of loving.
-They have a strange bark.

556
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:17,480
-Yes.
-More of a yap.

557
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:20,080
And they're lazy. Spend all day sleeping.

558
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:22,760
-Yes.
-They're awfully gassy.

559
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:25,000
Yes.

560
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:27,840
I suppose one can always open the windows.

561
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:29,160
[chuckles]

562
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:34,560
-Don't you miss it?
-What?

563
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:37,000
The country of your birth.
The people here.

564
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:39,560
Your own flesh and blood.

565
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:44,320
Well, I would've done
if they'd accepted the woman I love.

566
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:48,400
But they didn't, so I don't.

567
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:51,280
So the former King keeps himself
at a distance.

568
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:55,880
A distance that was imposed upon me.
They wanted me out.

569
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:58,440
And reduces us all to cruel nicknames.

570
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:01,760
Shirley Temple.

571
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:06,120
Uh... Yes.

572
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:08,880
On account of the curls?

573
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:13,760
And precociousness.

574
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:16,760
-And stardom.
-You flatterer.

575
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:17,880
Not at all.

576
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:22,400
Generally,
we're better at queens than kings.

577
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:25,600
In this country I have a feeling
you'll be no exception.

578
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:30,040
-I certainly intend to do it well.
-I did, too.

579
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:32,600
Obviously, not hard enough.

580
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:35,920
No.

581
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:41,320
You never apologized.

582
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:43,760
To your papa, I most certainly did.

583
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:46,720
Your mother too.
I can show you the letters.

584
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:50,680
I didn't mean to them. I meant to me.

585
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:53,480
You?

586
00:50:57,080 --> 00:50:58,960
You don't think I'm deserving of one.

587
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:04,960
You don't think I would have preferred
to grow up out of the spotlight?

588
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:06,920
Away from Court?

589
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:11,600
Away from the scrutiny and the visibility.

590
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:14,840
A simpler life.

591
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,160
Happier life.

592
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:19,800
As a wife, a mother.

593
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:24,920
An ordinary English countrywoman.

594
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:29,120
I'm sorry.

595
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:35,360
Thank you.

596
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:45,880
You might extend the same apology
to my husband the next time you see him.

597
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:49,560
-Oh, is he struggling?
-A little.

598
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:52,160
Well, it'd be odd if he weren't.

599
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:57,480
Anyway, if I am to succeed,

600
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:01,520
then he and I are going to need
all the help we can get.

601
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:05,920
Well, I'm sure you're surrounded
by good people offering it.

602
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,640
Not if they're always off
in Paris or New York,

603
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:10,840
or wherever it is you spend your time.

604
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:14,880
Y-You would take my advice?

605
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:16,960
I would.

606
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:21,400
Particularly now my father
isn't here to give his.

607
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:26,600
I'd know it came from the heart.

608
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:30,560
Since I know, deep down,
despite everything,

609
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:32,480
that you care very deeply.

610
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:35,400
I do.

611
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:47,560
As it happens, there are two issues

612
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:51,280
on which I would like to offer
some advice.

613
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:56,440
The first is your husband's surname
and the name of the Royal house.

614
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:01,040
And the second?

615
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:24,600
There you are. There's something
I'd like to discuss with you.

616
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:26,360
Now, please don't react.

617
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:29,520
I'd like to take flying lessons.

618
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:32,480
I know.

619
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:35,880
But, trust me, becoming a pilot
has been a lifelong ambition of mine

620
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:40,760
and I think I've found a teacher
mad enough to take me on as a pupil.

621
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:43,360
Peter, no less, Peter Townsend.

622
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:50,680
-What's the matter?
-I need to talk to you.

623
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:51,760
About what?

624
00:53:55,240 --> 00:53:57,080
They'd rather we didn't keep the name.

625
00:53:58,320 --> 00:53:59,880
Mountbatten.

626
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:03,000
Who's "they?"

627
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:05,400
-Cabinet.
-It's none of their business.

628
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:08,160
[scoffs] I think you'll find
it's very much their business.

629
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:10,920
You're my wife,
taking my name is the law.

630
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,960
It's the custom. Not the law.

631
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:15,840
A custom practiced so universally
it might as well be the law.

632
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:18,120
You can't do this.
Am I to be the only man in the country

633
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:20,000
whose wife and children
don't take his name?

634
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:22,680
You can't do this to Dickie.
It will devastate him.

635
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:25,600
You know that.
You know how important it is to him.

636
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:28,800
I've told him the Royal house Mountbatten
is in the bag.

637
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:32,320
Well, that was a mistake. It's not.

638
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:36,240
The name has to be Windsor. For stability.

639
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:38,400
There's more.

640
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:44,040
-Clarence House...
-Our home. What about it?

641
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:47,400
We have to give it up.

642
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:50,680
The home of the Sovereign
of the United Kingdom

643
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:51,840
is Buckingham Palace.

644
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:53,040
Says who?

645
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:56,720
Me.

646
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:00,600
I thought you hated that place.

647
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:04,000
I do. We all do.

648
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:07,880
Then why go along with it?

649
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:11,520
Because that's the overwhelming advice.

650
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:13,640
But that's the point, Elizabeth,
it's just advice.

651
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:15,760
It doesn't mean
that you have to act on it.

652
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:18,440
When it comes from the government,
you do.

653
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:32,960
What kind of marriage is this?

654
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:36,000
What kind of family?

655
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:39,840
You've taken my career from me,
you've taken my home.

656
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:42,840
You've taken my name.

657
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:51,800
I thought we were in this together.

658
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:05,480
[door opens, closes]

659
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:28,360
[Charles] See? Daddy's here.

660
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:30,120
Welcome home, ma'am.

661
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:43,160
[cheering]

662
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:58,600
[Queen Elizabeth]<i> My Lords...</i>

663
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:03,520
I hereby declare my will and pleasure

664
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:08,760
that I and my children
shall be styled and known

665
00:57:08,840 --> 00:57:11,960
as the House and Family of Windsor.

666
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,360
And that my descendants,

667
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:20,240
other than female descendants
who marry, and their descendants,

668
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:23,720
shall bear the name of Windsor.

669
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:36,040
[cheering, applause]
