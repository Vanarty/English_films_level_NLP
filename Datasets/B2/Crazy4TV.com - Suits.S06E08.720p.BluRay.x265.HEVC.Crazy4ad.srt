635
00:25:59,684 --> 00:26:02,062
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>What do you
say after dinner,
you take me home?</i></b></font>

636
00:26:03,939 --> 00:26:08,318
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>I say I think that
we should take it
slow this time.</i></b></font>

637
00:26:22,374 --> 00:26:23,917
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>Listen, I know
you hate me
right now.</i></b></font>

638
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,753
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>But right this second,
we are on the same side.</i></b></font>

639
00:26:27,963 --> 00:26:29,005
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>I know.</i></b></font>

640
00:26:29,965 --> 00:26:31,925
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>You do?
Yeah.</i></b></font>

641
00:26:32,008 --> 00:26:35,178
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>Because they just
let me out of solitary

642
00:26:35,303 --> 00:26:36,429
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>I was going to
tell her everything,</i></b></font>

643
00:26:36,513 --> 00:26:38,890
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>but before I got
a chance to do that,</i></b></font>

644
00:26:39,224 --> 00:26:40,558
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>she told me
she was indicted.</i></b></font>

645
00:26:41,268 --> 00:26:42,519
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>Kevin, I'm so sorry.</i></b></font>

646
00:26:42,686 --> 00:26:43,895
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>I don't need

You can help me.</i></b></font>

649
00:26:49,192 --> 00:26:51,611
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>But it can't be

650
00:26:51,695 --> 00:26:54,406
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>Because I'm telling you,

651
00:26:54,489 --> 00:26:55,448
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>she's gonna do that.</i></b></font>

652
00:26:55,532 --> 00:26:57,742
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>You really think
she's willing to go

653
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:03,665
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>Look, the night
I found out about her

654
00:27:03,748 --> 00:27:04,749

<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>how she could
have gotten involved
in something like this.</i></b></font>

656
00:27:08,211 --> 00:27:12,090

657
00:27:12,507 --> 00:27:13,883
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>She flipped out on him</i></b></font>

658
00:27:13,967 --> 00:27:15,885
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>and he gave her
some bullshit
sob story</i></b></font>

659
00:27:15,969 --> 00:27:17,512
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>about how the returns
were running dry.</i></b></font>

660
00:27:18,263 --> 00:27:22,934
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>He told her that if she
got inside information
for him, one time,</i></b></font>

661
00:27:23,435 --> 00:27:25,603
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>it would keep them
from losing everything.</i></b></font>

662
00:27:26,187 --> 00:27:28,398
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>And the next thing she knew,
it was too late to stop.</i></b></font>

663
00:27:28,481 --> 00:27:29,816
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>Yeah, he tricked her.</i></b></font>

664
00:27:29,899 --> 00:27:32,235
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>And when I tried
to tell her that</i></b></font>

665
00:27:32,402 --> 00:27:34,029
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>and get her to quit
with me, you know
what she said?</i></b></font>

666
00:27:34,738 --> 00:27:35,780
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>She said she'd
never do that.</i></b></font>

667
00:27:35,864 --> 00:27:37,365
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>Because no matter
what he did

668
00:27:37,449 --> 00:27:40,368
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>she knew he was willing
to run into a burning
building for her.</i></b></font>

669
00:27:41,328 --> 00:27:43,496
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>So, she was willing

670
00:27:45,165 --> 00:27:47,292
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>Kevin, I need you

<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>Hey, Tara.
I know I called
four minutes ago</i></b></font>

682
00:28:13,026 --> 00:28:14,903

683

684
00:28:17,489 --> 00:28:20,241
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>And I don't exactly

685
00:28:20,909 --> 00:28:24,120
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>But it's 7:12 and I'm

<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>Goddamn it.</i></b></font>

00:28:30,251 --> 00:28:32,087
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>Tara, please,
there's no need

689
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:33,380
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>I had them hold
the reservation</i></b></font>

704
00:28:59,155 --> 00:29:00,698
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>So, why don't

705
00:29:00,782 --> 00:29:02,242
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>something that
belongs to
someone else?</i></b></font>

706
00:29:02,325 --> 00:29:03,535

709
00:29:08,164 --> 00:29:09,374
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>This isn't

710

a spell on me.</i></b></font>

720

<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>And I would never
tell you how

721
00:29:31,813 --> 00:29:33,857
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>But I will not
share you with
another man.</i></b></font>

722
00:29:34,524 --> 00:29:36,359

726
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,628
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>Here, let me
help you with that.</i></b></font>

727
00:29:55,712 --> 00:29:56,713
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>Oh. Would you?</i></b></font>

728
00:29:56,796 --> 00:29:58,923
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>Of course, us redheads

763
00:31:36,062 --> 00:31:37,480
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>I'm here, just
like you asked.</i></b></font>

772
00:31:54,747 --> 00:31:56,165
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>You need to wake
the hell up.</i></b></font>

773
00:31:56,332 --> 00:31:57,750
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>What did you
just say to me?</i></b></font>

774

777
00:32:03,923 --> 00:32:06,426
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>She would never do that.

785
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:24,986

would I do that?</i></b></font>

786
00:32:25,361 --> 00:32:26,821
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>Because

787
00:32:26,904 --> 00:32:28,698
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>you're going

<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>But I don't.</i></b></font>

812
00:33:35,431 --> 00:33:36,432
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>So, I can.</i></b></font>

813
00:33:47,151 --> 00:33:48,861
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>Tara, I didn't think

to talk to you.</i></b></font>

817
00:33:55,034 --> 00:33:56,160
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>What is it?</i></b></font>

818
00:33:56,244 --> 00:33:59,539
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>Joshua called, he's coming
to town tomorrow for two days.</i></b></font>

819
00:34:00,373 --> 00:34:02,458

820
00:34:02,709 --> 00:34:05,545
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>Louis, we've been
together for years.</i></b></font>

821
00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:07,463
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>I can't just
not see him.</i></b></font>

822
00:34:08,423 --> 00:34:09,465
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>So, you're going
to break up with him?</i></b></font>

823
00:34:11,676 --> 00:34:12,802
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>I don't know.</i></b></font>

824
00:34:21,769 --> 00:34:23,146
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>Welcome
to Danbury, Sean.</i></b></font>

825
00:34:23,229 --> 00:34:25,606
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>You know, you're taking

going to recognize me</i></b></font>

826
00:34:25,690 --> 00:34:27,191
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>and figure out that
you're up to something.</i></b></font>

827
00:34:27,275 --> 00:34:28,484
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>I'd be taking
an even bigger risk</i></b></font>

828
00:34:28,735 --> 00:34:30,445
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>if I didn't hand this

829
00:34:32,905 --> 00:34:34,824
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>You're not going

830
00:34:35,825 --> 00:34:38,202
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>What is this?

833
00:34:41,289 --> 00:34:42,457

834
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,208
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>Does she know that
you're not a lawyer?</i></b></font>

835
00:34:44,333 --> 00:34:45,501
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>She does.</i></b></font>

836
00:34:46,252 --> 00:34:47,420
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>And she's okay with it</i></b></font>

837
00:34:47,503 --> 00:34:49,797
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>because I'm also

her out of prison.</i></b></font>

838
00:34:50,131 --> 00:34:51,758
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>Let me save you
the trouble of
reading that.</i></b></font>

839
00:34:51,841 --> 00:34:53,968
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>It says that she's
going to testify

840
00:34:54,093 --> 00:34:56,137
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>pleads no contest
and receives
full immunity.</i></b></font>

841
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:59,432
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>But it also says
that you acknowledge

842
00:34:59,682 --> 00:35:00,683
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>Hmm.</i></b></font>

843
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:05,062
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>Well, then, I better
bring it to my office
and sign it.</i></b></font>

844
00:35:09,817 --> 00:35:11,569
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>Oh, and for what
it's worth,</i></b></font>

845
00:35:12,653 --> 00:35:14,280
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>I didn't try to weasel

846
00:35:14,363 --> 00:35:16,199
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>I did everything I could

847
00:35:16,324 --> 00:35:18,075
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>Well, now
it's back in place.</i></b></font>

848
00:35:18,868 --> 00:35:20,787
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>Because I just gave you
everything that you need.</i></b></font>

849
00:35:20,912 --> 00:35:22,872
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>No, Mike, you didn't
give me everything yet.</i></b></font>

850
00:35:23,039 --> 00:35:25,792
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>Because what I still need

853
00:35:35,384 --> 00:35:36,385
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>Nice to see you,

854
00:35:36,552 --> 00:35:37,553
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>Can I get you
a drink?</i></b></font>

855
00:35:37,637 --> 00:35:38,721
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>You think
I wouldn't find out</i></b></font>

856
00:35:38,805 --> 00:35:40,306
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>that you recorded me
and played it
for my daughter?</i></b></font>

857
00:35:40,389 --> 00:35:41,390
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>I didn't play it
for her,</i></b></font>

858
00:35:41,474 --> 00:35:44,018
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>I played it for
my other client,
Kevin Miller.</i></b></font>

859
00:35:44,352 --> 00:35:45,686
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>Jill just happened
to be there when I did.</i></b></font>

860
00:35:45,812 --> 00:35:47,146
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>And now,
she's turning on me.</i></b></font>

861
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:48,272
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>Then I guess it
turns out</i></b></font>

862
00:35:48,397 --> 00:35:49,732
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>she didn't want

863
00:35:49,816 --> 00:35:51,526
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>to play more tennis

864
00:35:51,609 --> 00:35:52,777
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>Goddamn it.</i></b></font>

865
00:35:52,985 --> 00:35:54,695
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>You broke
attorney-client
privilege.</i></b></font>

866
00:35:54,821 --> 00:35:56,489
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>I didn't break
anything, William.</i></b></font>

867
00:35:56,572 --> 00:35:58,032
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>Because like
I just told you,</i></b></font>

868
00:35:58,115 --> 00:35:59,325
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>Kevin's my client, too.</i></b></font>

obligation to share
the facts with him.</i></b></font>

870
00:36:02,245 --> 00:36:03,538
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>So, instead
of attacking me,</i></b></font>

871
00:36:03,621 --> 00:36:05,081
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>you should be
thanking me.</i></b></font>

872
00:36:05,164 --> 00:36:07,041
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>Because I went to
Cahill and cut you</i></b></font>

873
00:36:07,166 --> 00:36:08,167
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>the best deal

874
00:36:09,085 --> 00:36:10,419

do this to me?</i></b></font>

875
00:36:10,545 --> 00:36:11,838
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>You did this
to yourself, William.</i></b></font>

876
00:36:11,921 --> 00:36:14,090
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>You had me represent
both you and Kevin,</i></b></font>

877
00:36:14,173 --> 00:36:16,884
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>which means I had
to choose between
two clients.</i></b></font>

878
00:36:16,968 --> 00:36:19,345
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>And you said it yourself.
You're an old man,</i></b></font>

879
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:21,848
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>and they're a young couple,

880
00:36:22,765 --> 00:36:24,642
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>I didn't have you
represent us both.</i></b></font>

881
00:36:25,017 --> 00:36:26,102
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>It was your idea.</i></b></font>

882
00:36:28,145 --> 00:36:29,605
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>I guess it was,
wasn't it?</i></b></font>

883
00:36:30,898 --> 00:36:32,149
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>You son of a bitch.</i></b></font>

884
00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:34,151
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>You set me up.</i></b></font>

885
00:36:34,277 --> 00:36:35,736
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>And I'm going
to make sure
the world knows it.</i></b></font>

886
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:38,155
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>You can tell the world
anything you want, William.</i></b></font>

887
00:36:38,239 --> 00:36:42,076

it from behind bars.</i></b></font>

888
00:36:42,159 --> 00:36:44,620
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>Either way,
I suggest you
sign this deal.</i></b></font>

889
00:36:45,037 --> 00:36:46,706
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>Because it's the best
you're ever going to get.</i></b></font>

890
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:03,556
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>Jessica, what are
you doing here?</i></b></font>

891
00:37:03,639 --> 00:37:05,016
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>I had a great time
last night.</i></b></font>

892
00:37:05,558 --> 00:37:07,393
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>And I was going
to call you about</i></b></font>

893
00:37:07,476 --> 00:37:11,230
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>going out again
next week because I know
you want to take it slow.</i></b></font>

894
00:37:11,314 --> 00:37:15,067
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>But then, I found out
that you wanted
to take it slow</i></b></font>

895
00:37:15,151 --> 00:37:17,820
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>because you may
not be here
much longer.</i></b></font>

896
00:37:18,821 --> 00:37:20,156
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>How did you find out?</i></b></font>

897
00:37:20,239 --> 00:37:22,325
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>They called
for a reference.</i></b></font>

898
00:37:23,451 --> 00:37:24,577
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>And what did you
tell them?</i></b></font>

899
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:26,120
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>I said they'd be lucky
to have you.</i></b></font>

900
00:37:26,537 --> 00:37:27,663
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>Thank you.</i></b></font>

901
00:37:27,830 --> 00:37:28,998
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>Why didn't you
tell me?</i></b></font>

902
00:37:29,832 --> 00:37:31,167
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>Because I wasn't sure
I was going to take it.</i></b></font>

903
00:37:31,667 --> 00:37:32,627
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>But now, you are.</i></b></font>

904
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:35,087
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>Jessica, if I thought
there would be
a chance in the world</i></b></font>

905
00:37:35,171 --> 00:37:37,173
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>that you would come with me,
I would have asked you.</i></b></font>

906
00:37:37,548 --> 00:37:40,009
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>But we both know
that's not gonna happen.</i></b></font>

907
00:37:40,092 --> 00:37:42,094
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>Because you told me
it's not over yet.</i></b></font>

908
00:37:42,261 --> 00:37:46,307
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>But what you meant
is that it's never
gonna be over.</i></b></font>

909
00:37:47,141 --> 00:37:48,851
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>It's my firm, Jeff.</i></b></font>

910
00:37:49,894 --> 00:37:52,104
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>It's the thing I've spent
my whole life building.</i></b></font>

911
00:37:52,188 --> 00:37:53,898
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>And I'm not
judging you for it.</i></b></font>

912
00:37:53,981 --> 00:37:58,486
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>You are who you are,
and I love who you are.</i></b></font>

913
00:37:59,570 --> 00:38:00,863
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>But I've been thinking
about going back</i></b></font>

914
00:38:00,947 --> 00:38:02,657
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>to Chicago
for a long time now.</i></b></font>

915
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:05,451
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>And as much as
seeing you again</i></b></font>

916
00:38:06,369 --> 00:38:08,120
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>makes me want
to stay here...</i></b></font>

917
00:38:12,208 --> 00:38:13,876
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>This is something
I have to do.</i></b></font>

918
00:38:16,921 --> 00:38:18,047
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>Like I said,</i></b></font>

919
00:38:20,466 --> 00:38:21,926
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>they're lucky
to have you.</i></b></font>

920
00:38:39,610 --> 00:38:40,695
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>It's done.</i></b></font>

921
00:38:42,363 --> 00:38:43,614
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>Sutter took the deal.</i></b></font>

922
00:38:45,157 --> 00:38:46,200
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>Jill's safe.</i></b></font>

923
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:56,085
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>Thank God.</i></b></font>

924
00:38:58,838 --> 00:38:59,880
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>I'm, uh,</i></b></font>

925
00:39:01,048 --> 00:39:03,259
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>sorry that Jill had
to hear what she heard.</i></b></font>

926
00:39:06,679 --> 00:39:08,097
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>It was the only way, man.</i></b></font>

927
00:39:10,266 --> 00:39:11,517
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>Besides,
you didn't say it.</i></b></font>

928
00:39:11,851 --> 00:39:13,019
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>No, but I did know
what I was doing</i></b></font>

929
00:39:13,102 --> 00:39:14,270
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>when I agreed
to inform on you.</i></b></font>

930
00:39:15,229 --> 00:39:16,272
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>I'm sorry.</i></b></font>

931
00:39:16,647 --> 00:39:18,107
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>You didn't deserve
any of that.</i></b></font>

932
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:21,152
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>Hey, look when
we first met,
I let Gallo in here.</i></b></font>

933
00:39:21,235 --> 00:39:23,320
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>And that was as
much a betrayal
as what you did to me.</i></b></font>

934
00:39:23,404 --> 00:39:24,822
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>MIKE: Yeah, but you
didn't know me.</i></b></font>

935
00:39:25,614 --> 00:39:26,657
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>I knew you.</i></b></font>

936
00:39:27,116 --> 00:39:28,325
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>What, are you trying
to make me hate you?</i></b></font>

937
00:39:28,743 --> 00:39:29,744
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>(SNICKERS)</i></b></font>

938
00:39:31,287 --> 00:39:32,288
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>No.</i></b></font>

939
00:39:34,832 --> 00:39:37,168
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>It's just that
I'm getting out
and you're not.</i></b></font>

940
00:39:38,252 --> 00:39:39,754
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>No, I'm not.</i></b></font>

941
00:39:42,131 --> 00:39:43,674
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>But you kept
my wife out of prison.</i></b></font>

942
00:39:44,633 --> 00:39:47,136
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>And as far as
I'm concerned,
that makes us square.</i></b></font>

943
00:39:50,973 --> 00:39:52,141
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>Thank you, Kevin.</i></b></font>

944
00:39:56,353 --> 00:39:57,563
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>Where are you going?</i></b></font>

945
00:39:58,439 --> 00:39:59,440
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>Me?</i></b></font>

946
00:39:59,523 --> 00:40:00,858
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>I'm going to give
you a few minutes</i></b></font>

947
00:40:00,941 --> 00:40:02,485
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>to enjoy the fact
that you're getting out.</i></b></font>

948
00:40:02,985 --> 00:40:05,988
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>And to call
Rachel and tell her.</i></b></font>

949
00:40:19,877 --> 00:40:20,961
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>Hey.</i></b></font>

950
00:40:22,338 --> 00:40:23,547
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>Donna, I'm
onto something.</i></b></font>

951
00:40:23,631 --> 00:40:24,632
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>I just need one second
to write it down.</i></b></font>

952
00:40:31,722 --> 00:40:33,182
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>What is it?
What are you
so happy about?</i></b></font>

953
00:40:33,265 --> 00:40:34,517
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>I think I just
figured out a way</i></b></font>

954
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:36,185
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>to get Leonard Bailey's
case reopened.</i></b></font>

955
00:40:36,602 --> 00:40:39,271
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>Rachel, that's amazing.
Come on, get your things.</i></b></font>

956
00:40:39,355 --> 00:40:40,356
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>We can talk about
it on the way out,</i></b></font>

957
00:40:40,439 --> 00:40:41,440
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>because we're
going to celebrate.</i></b></font>

958
00:40:41,524 --> 00:40:44,652
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>No, it's good news but
I'm not ready to celebrate.</i></b></font>

959
00:40:44,735 --> 00:40:46,195
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>Yes, you are.</i></b></font>

960
00:40:47,613 --> 00:40:48,823
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>Because I'm not
talking about
your case.</i></b></font>

961
00:40:50,032 --> 00:40:51,784
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>Rachel, Harvey
and Mike did it.</i></b></font>

962
00:40:52,618 --> 00:40:53,702
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>Mike's getting out.</i></b></font>

963
00:40:54,703 --> 00:40:55,788
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>What?</i></b></font>

964
00:40:55,913 --> 00:40:56,997
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>You heard me.</i></b></font>

965
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:58,541
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>They did it.</i></b></font>

966
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,628
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>Sutter's going away,
which means Mike's
coming home.</i></b></font>

967
00:41:05,714 --> 00:41:06,924
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>Oh, my God.</i></b></font>

968
00:41:08,342 --> 00:41:09,718
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>Oh, God.</i></b></font>

969
00:41:12,471 --> 00:41:13,556
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>Come on.</i></b></font>

970
00:41:13,806 --> 00:41:15,474

973
00:41:22,189 --> 00:41:23,232
<font color=#FFFF00><b><i>It's Mike.</i></b></font>
