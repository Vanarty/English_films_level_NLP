1
00:00:01,735 --> 00:00:05,070
It is the headquarters of
the world's most famous spy organisation,

2
00:00:07,173 --> 00:00:10,275
the legendary home of
Agent 007... James Bond.

3
00:00:12,912 --> 00:00:17,583
This is MI6, otherwise
known as Her Majesty's Secret Service.

4
00:00:18,985 --> 00:00:23,122
Now, with unprecedented access to the major players
in British espionage...

5
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:27,493
It's exciting and the
adrenaline is pumping round.

6
00:00:28,561 --> 00:00:31,430
...we reveal the truth behind
the covert operations,

7
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:35,134
the secret missions
and the double-agents.

8
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:42,341
We expose the dangerous
secret world

9
00:00:42,409 --> 00:00:44,410
of real-life spies.

10
00:00:45,145 --> 00:00:48,113
There are far more spies
in London now

11
00:00:48,181 --> 00:00:49,481
than there were during the Cold War.

12
00:01:10,937 --> 00:01:13,472
London, a cosmopolitan metropolis

13
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:14,840
of 8 million inhabitants.

14
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:20,012
And home to the world-renowned
British Secret Service.

15
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:24,750
For decades,
cunning games of espionage

16
00:01:24,818 --> 00:01:27,086
have been played out
on the city's streets.

17
00:01:31,324 --> 00:01:33,125
Assassinations...

18
00:01:33,193 --> 00:01:35,427
treason... and betrayal.

19
00:01:38,865 --> 00:01:41,200
London has always been a
crossroads, a global city.

20
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:43,702
You've always had lots of
exiles and dissidents here.

21
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:47,272
That means it's a real
meeting place for spies...

22
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:50,309
British spies, spies from
other countries trying to recruit people,

23
00:01:50,376 --> 00:01:52,444
trying to run operations.

24
00:01:52,512 --> 00:01:56,348
I think it's meant that London is
one of the great spy cities in the world.

25
00:01:58,852 --> 00:02:00,853
Entering the high-stakes
world of spying,

26
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,388
we learn what's really
going on in the shadows.

27
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:09,328
From the highest echelons
of MI6...

28
00:02:09,863 --> 00:02:14,633
The best form of defence
against plots and attacks

29
00:02:14,701 --> 00:02:16,602
is to know about it in advance.

30
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:19,238
It was all about
collecting intelligence

31
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:21,440
and recruiting
and running sources.

32
00:02:21,508 --> 00:02:24,309
...to field operatives who
risked their lives...

33
00:02:25,178 --> 00:02:28,213
At my peak, I was operating
under about 14 or 15 different aliases.

34
00:02:28,948 --> 00:02:32,851
...unsung heroes of Britain's
most secret code-breaking station...

35
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:37,422
We broke a message
that said 'Today's the day minus three.'

36
00:02:38,558 --> 00:02:41,026
...the KGB double agents
who fought the Cold War.

37
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:01,713
The Secret Intelligence
Service exists to defend

38
00:03:01,781 --> 00:03:05,017
and protect the security
and interests of the United Kingdom.

39
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:09,888
It's known by its
World War One designation

40
00:03:09,956 --> 00:03:11,990
as Military Intelligence Section 6...

41
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:14,927
or MI6.

42
00:03:16,095 --> 00:03:20,265
This green and cream building
behind me is the headquarters of MI6.

43
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:22,401
That's the Secret
Intelligence Service,

44
00:03:22,468 --> 00:03:24,736
Britain's foreign
intelligence service,

45
00:03:24,804 --> 00:03:26,672
the equivalent of the CIA.

46
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:32,010
Within intelligence circles,
the building is known as VX,

47
00:03:32,078 --> 00:03:35,881
after its location at Vauxhall Cross on the banks
of the River Thames.

48
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:41,220
It became even more identifiable to millions of
cinema fans around the globe

49
00:03:41,287 --> 00:03:44,256
when it was famously blown up
in the Bond movie, Skyfall.

50
00:03:47,093 --> 00:03:51,563
It is probably the most
famous secret service building in the world

51
00:03:51,631 --> 00:03:53,398
thanks to the James Bond films.

52
00:03:55,335 --> 00:03:57,102
The fictional world of 007

53
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:59,004
may be glamorous and entertaining

54
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:02,841
but the reality of life in
MI6 is far more serious.

55
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:12,384
Someone who knows this dark
world better than most is Sir John Scarlett.

56
00:04:13,853 --> 00:04:16,788
For 38 years, he was one
of MI6's top operatives,

57
00:04:16,856 --> 00:04:19,625
rising to Chief of the Service in 2004.

58
00:04:21,861 --> 00:04:25,597
MI6 is essentially an
information gathering agency.

59
00:04:25,665 --> 00:04:27,733
It collects intelligence.

60
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,968
That is its job and it is
very good at it.

61
00:04:31,537 --> 00:04:33,438
During his five-year tenure
as Chief,

62
00:04:33,506 --> 00:04:37,676
Sir John authorised many dangerous and daring
intelligence operations.

63
00:04:38,745 --> 00:04:41,980
There's not much I can share but I think,
like many of my colleagues,

64
00:04:42,048 --> 00:04:44,182
over a long period of time,

65
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:47,419
I've quite often been
in situations where it's exciting,

66
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:49,955
and the best way of describing it is,

67
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:52,291
the adrenaline, you know,
is pumping round.

68
00:04:54,527 --> 00:04:56,495
To preserve secrecy and security,

69
00:04:56,562 --> 00:04:59,064
MI6 never acknowledges
its missions or spies.

70
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:03,602
But one spy has outed himself
and talked...

71
00:05:05,672 --> 00:05:08,907
former undercover MI6 officer
and now author, Matthew Dunn.

72
00:05:10,376 --> 00:05:13,412
The majority of what I did
was recruiting foreign spies,

73
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:16,214
typically nationals who
were placed in positions

74
00:05:16,282 --> 00:05:17,683
that gave them access to secrets

75
00:05:18,584 --> 00:05:21,320
and targeting senior echelons
within rogue states.

76
00:05:21,387 --> 00:05:23,388
That was the core of my work.

77
00:05:24,857 --> 00:05:28,627
In MI6-speak, those passing
on secret intelligence are called agents,

78
00:05:31,064 --> 00:05:34,433
while men such as Dunn,
who run the agents, are called officers.

79
00:05:36,202 --> 00:05:38,203
Both are commonly
referred to as spies.

80
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:45,210
Dunn typically met his agents
in the bars and rooms of London's top hotels,

81
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,413
glossy surroundings
that are far more dangerous

82
00:05:48,481 --> 00:05:50,515
than they seem to the average tourist.

83
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:57,289
The biggest concern a case officer has when attending a
covert meeting with an agent

84
00:05:57,357 --> 00:06:01,059
is fear that he is being
followed by a hostile surveillance team.

85
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:05,731
In order to address that,
the officer will walk a anti-surveillance route.

86
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:09,101
Officers will establish
what's called a theme,

87
00:06:09,168 --> 00:06:11,470
and in this case, I'm walking
down Jermyn Street

88
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:13,305
and my theme is shirt shopping.

89
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,208
If a team's following me,

90
00:06:16,275 --> 00:06:18,143
they will think I am shirt shopping.

91
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:24,750
If an officer spots the same
face more than once on his anti-surveillance route,

92
00:06:24,817 --> 00:06:26,618
this is called a double-sighting.

93
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:30,722
This person may well be
enemy surveillance,

94
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:33,091
in which case, the officer
has to abort the meeting.

95
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:39,498
I've often felt when
operating that there was a threat to me,

96
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,568
that I could be snatched or
the person you're with could be snatched.

97
00:06:46,606 --> 00:06:49,608
And that threat
could include death.

98
00:06:52,345 --> 00:06:56,448
Today MI6 has over 3,200
officers operating across the globe.

99
00:06:58,251 --> 00:06:59,818
They run covert operations,

100
00:07:01,721 --> 00:07:03,622
infiltrate terrorist organisations

101
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:06,658
and foil international plots.

102
00:07:07,994 --> 00:07:11,596
They need to extract
information from the most sensitive of sources.

103
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:15,100
One of the core strengths of MI6

104
00:07:15,168 --> 00:07:18,570
is our agent-running skills
and that is world renowned.

105
00:07:18,638 --> 00:07:21,373
Other agencies...
the CIA, European agencies,

106
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:25,043
do recognise that our agent-handling abilities
are second to none.

107
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:28,780
MI6 will use any tool in its arsenal,

108
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:30,782
including blackmail and bribery,

109
00:07:31,584 --> 00:07:34,719
to persuade foreign agents
to betray their country

110
00:07:35,521 --> 00:07:37,656
and hand over top secret
information.

111
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:40,325
This is what happens
in this sort of business.

112
00:07:40,393 --> 00:07:41,860
That was a great skill.

113
00:07:41,928 --> 00:07:43,862
You have to talent spot
people in the first place,

114
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:46,031
you have to spot them,
see their potential

115
00:07:46,098 --> 00:07:47,999
and then bring them under control.

116
00:07:49,368 --> 00:07:53,605
These skills have been
perfected over the agency's 100-year history.

117
00:07:56,275 --> 00:07:59,711
Britain's Secret Service was
founded on 1st October, 1909,

118
00:08:00,346 --> 00:08:04,716
to gather intelligence about the growing
military threat from imperial Germany.

119
00:08:06,385 --> 00:08:08,053
Tensions were rising in Europe

120
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,855
and people feared German spies

121
00:08:09,922 --> 00:08:11,790
were infiltrating Britain.

122
00:08:13,292 --> 00:08:15,193
The Daily Mail told its readers

123
00:08:15,261 --> 00:08:17,496
to refuse to be served
by German waiters:

124
00:08:18,364 --> 00:08:20,198
'If your waiter says he's Swiss,

125
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:21,900
demand to see his passport.'

126
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:27,706
MI6's first headquarters were
near the corridors of power in Whitehall.

127
00:08:30,409 --> 00:08:33,078
But few in government knew
the agency even existed.

128
00:08:35,081 --> 00:08:39,050
Where we are now is where
the earliest headquarters of MI6 is,

129
00:08:39,118 --> 00:08:41,152
and that's up in that tower.

130
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:43,522
2 Whitehall Court
was the foreign section

131
00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:45,557
of the Secret Service Bureau.

132
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:50,362
It's where Mansfield Cumming
set up his early headquarters

133
00:08:50,429 --> 00:08:52,497
and throughout the First World War,

134
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:54,799
that's where what
we now call MI6 was based.

135
00:08:57,703 --> 00:09:00,605
Mansfield Cumming was the
first Chief of the Service.

136
00:09:01,908 --> 00:09:04,543
He was a naval officer who
would go on spying missions

137
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:06,478
wearing rather bizarre disguises.

138
00:09:08,247 --> 00:09:11,349
His office was a laboratory
of strange gadgets and devices.

139
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:14,219
He was very innovative,

140
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:17,956
he was one of the first
people in Britain to take his pilot's license.

141
00:09:18,491 --> 00:09:21,192
He had a special license
plate for his Rolls Royce

142
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:24,663
which allowed him to drive
up and down London streets

143
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:28,066
at any speed he wanted to
without being stopped by the police.

144
00:09:28,134 --> 00:09:30,001
He was a real character.

145
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:36,074
His staffing and interview
methods were uniquely gruesome.

146
00:09:37,143 --> 00:09:39,411
He had a wooden leg.

147
00:09:40,112 --> 00:09:42,280
And when he was recruiting
new officers,

148
00:09:42,348 --> 00:09:44,816
he would frequently
take his pen knife

149
00:09:44,884 --> 00:09:46,651
and stab it into this wooden leg.

150
00:09:52,558 --> 00:09:55,860
he was just the right man
to work for Britain's Secret Service.

151
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,297
Cumming knew that good agents

152
00:09:59,365 --> 00:10:01,866
were the most important tool
in the spying game.

153
00:10:04,837 --> 00:10:07,405
From the very beginning, he
understood it was all about

154
00:10:07,473 --> 00:10:10,976
collecting intelligence
and recruiting and running sources.

155
00:10:11,978 --> 00:10:14,412
From the very beginning,
that's what he did.

156
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,847
It was just in the bloodstream.

157
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:22,087
Cumming disguised his
organisation's true activity

158
00:10:22,154 --> 00:10:26,157
by pretending it was an
import/export business called Rasen, Falcon & Co.

159
00:10:29,762 --> 00:10:32,464
To this day,
MI6 uses fake companies

160
00:10:32,531 --> 00:10:35,200
as a cover for
its clandestine operations abroad.

161
00:10:37,203 --> 00:10:39,604
Cumming also created other traditions

162
00:10:39,672 --> 00:10:41,806
still maintained
by his MI6 successors.

163
00:10:44,043 --> 00:10:46,978
He brought with him the naval
tradition of the captain

164
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:49,080
writing his log in green ink.

165
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:53,518
Even now, the Chief of MI6
still writes in green ink,

166
00:10:53,586 --> 00:10:54,886
because Cumming did.

167
00:10:56,589 --> 00:10:59,424
His most famous legacy,
however, is his signature.

168
00:11:00,192 --> 00:11:03,695
Cumming was given
the title of C as a cover,

169
00:11:04,296 --> 00:11:06,398
it was simply the first letter of his name.

170
00:11:07,967 --> 00:11:11,136
It's obviously where M
in James Bond comes from

171
00:11:11,203 --> 00:11:15,106
and even now, the Chief of
MI6, as he's now called,

172
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:17,242
signs his letter with a C.

173
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:23,081
Signing yourself as C is a
reminder that we have a continuing tradition.

174
00:11:23,783 --> 00:11:25,550
Everything leads to
everything else.

175
00:11:25,618 --> 00:11:27,719
There's been no break.
That's what's exceptional.

176
00:11:32,224 --> 00:11:35,226
In 1918, Cumming recruited
his most brilliant agent,

177
00:11:35,294 --> 00:11:37,696
the infamous Sidney Reilly,
Ace of Spies.

178
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:42,967
Reilly, who could speak
seven languages fluently,

179
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:44,736
was utterly fearless,

180
00:11:44,804 --> 00:11:47,972
a hardened gambler and
a famous seducer of women.

181
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:52,644
In some ways he was the
perfect spy because he was a bit of conman.

182
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:55,580
And he was able to persuade
people to do things,

183
00:11:55,648 --> 00:11:58,483
just like any conman, that
they wouldn't normally do.

184
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:02,020
So he is a great collector
of intelligence

185
00:12:02,088 --> 00:12:03,922
and he has these daring operations.

186
00:12:05,825 --> 00:12:09,194
Reilly's adventures are
straight out of the pages of a novel.

187
00:12:10,129 --> 00:12:13,998
In France, he poses as
a priest to win Britain important oil concessions.

188
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:20,205
In the Far East, he steals
Russian naval plans to sell to the highest bidder.

189
00:12:22,308 --> 00:12:24,542
He was operating as a film agent

190
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:26,911
and as a Greek businessman,

191
00:12:26,979 --> 00:12:29,147
changing his identity
at various stages.

192
00:12:32,184 --> 00:12:36,121
After his death, the Evening Standard Newspaper
serialises his memoirs.

193
00:12:37,656 --> 00:12:40,325
He is at once immortalised
as a master of deception.

194
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:44,329
He was the Ace of Spies.
He was brilliant.

195
00:12:47,466 --> 00:12:50,635
In 1926, MI6 moves
to new headquarters

196
00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:53,705
opposite St James's Park
underground station in London.

197
00:12:56,575 --> 00:12:59,511
It grows quickly into
a sophisticated organisation,

198
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:02,313
collecting intelligence,
running agents

199
00:13:02,381 --> 00:13:04,349
and mounting
covert operations overseas.

200
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:11,823
Within 15 years, it has
a spy network stretching across the globe.

201
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:15,460
It won't be long before the
organisation's capabilities

202
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:17,395
are tested to their limits.

203
00:13:21,667 --> 00:13:23,835
'The German foe begins its
ruthless march of conquest.'

204
00:13:27,373 --> 00:13:31,509
On 1st September, 1939,
Germany invades Poland.

205
00:13:32,444 --> 00:13:34,412
Europe is at war.

206
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:37,982
Now more than ever, Britain's
Secret Service needs to know

207
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:39,918
what its enemy is up to.

208
00:13:41,954 --> 00:13:43,721
Europe's freedom depends on it.

209
00:13:45,057 --> 00:13:48,126
One of MI6's new recruits
is Mavis Batey,

210
00:13:48,194 --> 00:13:50,962
a 19-year-old student
studying German literature.

211
00:13:53,899 --> 00:13:55,967
Little does she know
what lies in store.

212
00:13:57,336 --> 00:14:00,104
I was told that I was wanted
at a place in the country.

213
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:02,273
They wouldn't
tell you where you were going

214
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:05,443
but they told you to go
to Euston station

215
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:07,879
and you would be met with a ticket.

216
00:14:10,115 --> 00:14:11,683
I thought I was going
to be Mata Hari,

217
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:14,185
I was going to be a spy,
I was terribly excited.

218
00:14:17,122 --> 00:14:19,824
Mavis's mystery destination
is Bletchley Park,

219
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,062
an old manor house hidden
50 miles north of London.

220
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:27,932
It's the home of a top
secret department within MI6

221
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:31,536
that is decrypting enemy
coded communications.

222
00:14:35,307 --> 00:14:38,409
Mavis's boss, chief
cryptographer Dilly Knox,

223
00:14:39,245 --> 00:14:41,846
is an eccentric chain-smoking
classics scholar.

224
00:14:42,915 --> 00:14:45,650
He was sitting,
smoke all round him

225
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:47,418
and he just looked up and said,

226
00:14:47,486 --> 00:14:50,288
'We're breaking machines.
Have you got a pencil?'

227
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:54,225
And that was my introduction
to breaking Enigma.

228
00:14:58,163 --> 00:15:01,933
In 1939, Enigma is the
world's most secure encryption machine

229
00:15:02,835 --> 00:15:06,437
and the Germans are using it to encode all
their war communications.

230
00:15:08,107 --> 00:15:11,843
The machine uses a clever
combination of interchangeable rotors,

231
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,978
moving rings and switchable plugs

232
00:15:14,046 --> 00:15:15,914
to scramble its messages.

233
00:15:17,783 --> 00:15:20,418
The Germans believe its codes
to be unbreakable.

234
00:15:21,186 --> 00:15:23,454
The number of ways the
operator could set this up

235
00:15:23,522 --> 00:15:27,558
was roughly 158.9 million
million million.

236
00:15:28,294 --> 00:15:30,161
The daily setting
was known as the key

237
00:15:30,229 --> 00:15:34,432
and the setting changed
every day at midnight Greenwich Mean Time.

238
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:37,902
Breaking the Enigma codes

239
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:39,904
will be key to winning
the war.

240
00:15:41,073 --> 00:15:43,741
Mathematicians may be an
obvious choice for the work

241
00:15:43,809 --> 00:15:47,512
but the unsung heroes of
Bletchley were a unique group of young women.

242
00:15:49,815 --> 00:15:53,551
There was one actress,
one who'd been to a drama school,

243
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:56,688
and of all things,
a speech therapist.

244
00:15:57,656 --> 00:16:01,559
And they were all people who
knew patterns of language

245
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,494
and picking it apart.

246
00:16:06,999 --> 00:16:09,701
Armed with only pencils,
paper and bits of card,

247
00:16:09,768 --> 00:16:12,904
it takes the code breakers
five months of ceaseless work

248
00:16:13,072 --> 00:16:15,173
to decipher their first
Enigma message.

249
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:20,712
Mavis's big moment
would come a year later

250
00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:22,613
during a critical period of the war.

251
00:16:26,552 --> 00:16:29,320
The British learn the enemy are planning
a surprise attack

252
00:16:29,388 --> 00:16:31,556
on the Allied fleet
in the Mediterranean.

253
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,859
But they don't know
when it's coming.

254
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:38,196
Then, on 25th March, 1941,

255
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:41,099
Mavis decodes
an extraordinary message.

256
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:46,604
We broke a message that said,

257
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:48,539
'Today's the day minus three'.

258
00:16:49,908 --> 00:16:51,776
We then knew
what they were planning.

259
00:16:52,911 --> 00:16:55,179
Everyone was so excited about that.

260
00:16:58,384 --> 00:17:00,785
Forewarned of the impending offensive,

261
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:03,821
the British call in backup
and turn the tables on the enemy.

262
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:12,196
Thousands of lives are saved
thanks to Mavis and her colleagues.

263
00:17:13,232 --> 00:17:16,100
Well, we were very good at it,
I suppose, very cunning.

264
00:17:16,168 --> 00:17:19,303
Because it was largely
a strange mixture

265
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:22,173
of logic and guesswork
by which you broke things.

266
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:25,143
So we were all a bit dotty afterwards

267
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:27,111
and very good at Scrabble, of course.

268
00:17:29,581 --> 00:17:33,351
Churchill considered the
code breakers' work so vital to the war effort

269
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:37,121
that he famously called them
'the geese that laid the golden egg'.

270
00:17:37,623 --> 00:17:40,725
It is extremely unusual to
get such comprehensive...

271
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:42,827
in fact unprecedented,
in my experience...

272
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:45,596
to get such comprehensive
coverage of your opponent,

273
00:17:45,664 --> 00:17:47,665
especially in a war,

274
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:50,935
both at the operational level and also at the level
of their top-level thinking

275
00:17:51,003 --> 00:17:52,403
and strategic intentions.

276
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:57,708
As the number of enemy
communications increases,

277
00:17:57,776 --> 00:17:59,811
Bletchley Park lacks
the money and manpower

278
00:17:59,878 --> 00:18:01,579
to decipher all of them.

279
00:18:04,216 --> 00:18:07,085
The only people in a position
to help are the Americans.

280
00:18:11,657 --> 00:18:13,357
So in February, 1941,

281
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:16,661
a secret delegation from
the USA is invited to Bletchley Park

282
00:18:16,728 --> 00:18:18,596
for an historic meeting.

283
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:24,035
Britain reveals its most
guarded wartime secret,

284
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,970
the cracking of the Enigma codes.

285
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:29,207
But it has an ulterior motive:

286
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:31,142
to draw the US into the war.

287
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:37,048
By bringing the Americans
across, by confiding in them

288
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:39,317
about breaking the German codes,

289
00:18:39,384 --> 00:18:41,853
you try to make them
partners in the effort,

290
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:44,722
even though the Americans
are not formally in the war.

291
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:47,692
You try to give the idea
that somehow

292
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:50,094
we are both in this together
against Hitler.

293
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:53,831
This is the first time
that any two nations

294
00:18:53,899 --> 00:18:56,968
have agreed to share such
vital secret intelligence.

295
00:18:57,903 --> 00:19:01,272
It's the beginning of what
will become known as 'the special relationship'.

296
00:19:02,274 --> 00:19:04,142
At that particular time,

297
00:19:04,209 --> 00:19:06,177
we had no formal treaty
alliance between us.

298
00:19:07,246 --> 00:19:10,748
There wasn't the history
of co-operation which subsequently developed

299
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:15,286
and if you're looking for a
sort of single symbolic event

300
00:19:15,354 --> 00:19:18,990
which captures that rather
remarkable situation,

301
00:19:19,057 --> 00:19:20,925
then it is here we were,

302
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:22,994
prepared to talk to each other

303
00:19:23,061 --> 00:19:26,264
about the most secret things
that we were doing.

304
00:19:29,101 --> 00:19:32,770
The relationship gradually
deepens as the two allies work together.

305
00:19:33,805 --> 00:19:35,439
Eventually American code breakers

306
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:38,476
are even stationed alongside
the British at Bletchley.

307
00:19:40,045 --> 00:19:42,747
The Americans were absolutely fascinated

308
00:19:42,814 --> 00:19:46,751
because when they came
and saw us with these things in jam jars,

309
00:19:46,818 --> 00:19:49,387
they just couldn't believe
what we were doing.

310
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:53,891
One of them said,
'My goodness, if they were the Pentagon,

311
00:19:53,959 --> 00:19:57,228
there'd be rows and rows
of shiny files

312
00:19:57,296 --> 00:19:58,963
and nothing in them,

313
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:01,599
and you do everything in
these goddamn shoeboxes.'

314
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:05,469
The methods might be basic

315
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:09,006
but the Americans are still
impressed by the Brits' ingenuity.

316
00:20:09,575 --> 00:20:12,476
They recognise how well MI6 coordinates

317
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:15,813
all its various sections
from its London headquarters.

318
00:20:16,348 --> 00:20:20,851
Everything from cryptography
to counter-espionage is under this central control.

319
00:20:21,853 --> 00:20:23,354
The US has nothing like it.

320
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:26,290
In the words of Henry Stimson,

321
00:20:26,358 --> 00:20:28,326
who was the Secretary of Defence in the US,

322
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:30,928
'Gentlemen don't read each other's mail'.

323
00:20:30,996 --> 00:20:34,599
So the Americans didn't see
the need for a peacetime intelligence service.

324
00:20:36,602 --> 00:20:40,071
In 1942, the Office of Strategic Services,

325
00:20:40,138 --> 00:20:43,608
America's very first
centralised intelligence organisation,

326
00:20:43,675 --> 00:20:46,410
is set up at Rockefeller
Center in New York City.

327
00:20:46,979 --> 00:20:50,081
Heading the agency is former
army colonel William Donovan.

328
00:20:51,016 --> 00:20:52,984
Because he was an anglophile,

329
00:20:53,051 --> 00:20:56,654
he said, 'We'll structure it
the way the British have set up MI6.

330
00:20:56,722 --> 00:21:00,725
We'll set it up for intelligence, analysis
and also covert operations.'

331
00:21:01,627 --> 00:21:04,328
British brains to guide
American brawn.

332
00:21:06,398 --> 00:21:09,634
The British let the Americans
use their espionage network

333
00:21:09,701 --> 00:21:12,203
and covert listening
stations across Europe.

334
00:21:13,905 --> 00:21:16,741
The Americans are rapidly
trying to catch up with the British.

335
00:21:16,808 --> 00:21:20,211
So we have the development
of a special relationship of structures

336
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:23,281
but we also have the development of a special
relationship of people,

337
00:21:23,348 --> 00:21:26,284
people who get to know
each other during the war

338
00:21:26,351 --> 00:21:28,686
and who,
after the war ends in 1945,

339
00:21:28,754 --> 00:21:31,055
continue to be in contact
with each other.

340
00:21:32,057 --> 00:21:36,560
By 1947, the OSS is reformed
as the world-renowned CIA.

341
00:21:38,597 --> 00:21:42,066
American co-operation with
British Intelligence continues to grow closer.

342
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:46,504
That initial move
lies at the very heart

343
00:21:46,571 --> 00:21:51,142
of the quite unique defence
and security relationship

344
00:21:51,209 --> 00:21:53,611
that the United Kingdom has
had with the United States

345
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:55,813
ever since 1941.

346
00:21:58,383 --> 00:22:00,318
In these early days of the war,

347
00:22:00,385 --> 00:22:04,255
Churchill sees that he'll need to fight dirty to stand
any chance of winning.

348
00:22:06,091 --> 00:22:08,993
MI6 runs secret sabotage
missions abroad

349
00:22:09,061 --> 00:22:12,763
from a small unit that is aptly named
'the Destruction department'.

350
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:15,166
In July, 1940, they join forces

351
00:22:15,233 --> 00:22:18,336
with government propaganda
and research departments

352
00:22:18,403 --> 00:22:20,905
to create the
Special Operations Executive.

353
00:22:21,707 --> 00:22:24,008
Its mission is to sabotage
the German Army

354
00:22:24,076 --> 00:22:26,043
and set Europe ablaze.

355
00:22:27,379 --> 00:22:30,214
To do this, it adopts the
guerrilla warfare tactics

356
00:22:30,282 --> 00:22:32,650
used so successfully by the IRA.

357
00:22:37,322 --> 00:22:39,390
This secret army has its beginnings

358
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:42,560
in the most unlikely
of elegant and refined surroundings.

359
00:22:46,131 --> 00:22:49,667
Author Gill Bennett has
documented official government history

360
00:22:49,735 --> 00:22:51,635
for more than 30 years.

361
00:22:53,105 --> 00:22:55,473
Well, this is
the St. Ermin's hotel,

362
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:58,342
which has definitely strong
intelligence connections

363
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:00,945
particularly from
the Second World War.

364
00:23:01,012 --> 00:23:03,180
It's only round the corner
from the headquarters

365
00:23:03,248 --> 00:23:06,150
of the Secret Intelligence
Service at the time, SIS,

366
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:09,086
very near to Whitehall,
very near to Westminster,

367
00:23:09,154 --> 00:23:11,889
and so you could just
go across St James's Park

368
00:23:11,957 --> 00:23:14,191
to wherever Churchill was,

369
00:23:14,259 --> 00:23:16,560
to what are now called
the Cabinet War rooms.

370
00:23:17,329 --> 00:23:19,964
Part of the Special
Operations Executive, SOE,

371
00:23:20,031 --> 00:23:23,100
was formed here,
 it had its offices upstairs.

372
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:26,337
It looks very beautiful
and light and romantic

373
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:28,205
but it was nevertheless a place

374
00:23:28,273 --> 00:23:30,775
where a lot of clandestine
meetings took place.

375
00:23:32,444 --> 00:23:35,946
Most SOE operatives are
foreigners who have fled occupied Europe.

376
00:23:37,315 --> 00:23:39,650
French, Spaniards,
Danes and Poles

377
00:23:39,718 --> 00:23:42,153
are recruited for
their language skills

378
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:44,355
and knowledge of occupied territories.

379
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:47,258
All are united by their desire

380
00:23:47,325 --> 00:23:49,627
to liberate their homeland
from the Germans.

381
00:23:49,694 --> 00:23:51,662
They were often called
a bunch of amateurs.

382
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:54,498
Actually, a lot of them
were a bunch of amateurs

383
00:23:54,566 --> 00:23:58,569
but it was not a universally
liked part of the intelligence establishment,

384
00:23:58,637 --> 00:24:00,671
even though, of course, in retrospect

385
00:24:00,739 --> 00:24:02,907
it is seen as having had
a major impact.

386
00:24:04,376 --> 00:24:06,410
Like any other MI6 operative,

387
00:24:06,478 --> 00:24:08,546
preparation is key to their survival.

388
00:24:09,548 --> 00:24:11,715
Before being parachuted
into enemy territory,

389
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:14,819
SOE agents undergo months
of intense commando training.

390
00:24:17,389 --> 00:24:19,857
They would learn how to do self-defence,

391
00:24:20,325 --> 00:24:22,526
silent killing using their bare hands,

392
00:24:22,594 --> 00:24:25,362
and also close combat,
using a variety of weapons.

393
00:24:26,331 --> 00:24:29,066
Machine guns, daggers,
silk escape maps

394
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:31,368
and even cleverly
disguised suitcase radios

395
00:24:31,436 --> 00:24:33,404
are all part of their spy kit.

396
00:24:33,905 --> 00:24:35,372
This is a Welrod pistol.

397
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,541
This is a silenced weapon,

398
00:24:37,609 --> 00:24:40,244
so it's very, very effective
for assassination

399
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:42,480
when you need things to be quieter.

400
00:24:42,547 --> 00:24:44,515
It's a very iconic SOE weapon.

401
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:48,352
Women would be seen out
wearing their hats all of the time.

402
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:50,354
So take your hat pin,

403
00:24:50,422 --> 00:24:52,857
make it thicker, stronger

404
00:24:52,924 --> 00:24:55,025
and with a very,
very sharp point.

405
00:24:55,093 --> 00:24:57,695
And as long as you know
where you're aiming for,

406
00:24:57,762 --> 00:25:00,297
this dagger is going to
be extremely effective.

407
00:25:00,365 --> 00:25:03,334
SOE used plastic explosive.

408
00:25:03,902 --> 00:25:06,270
This is a very malleable
type of explosive.

409
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:08,772
A famous SOE weapon is the rat.

410
00:25:09,274 --> 00:25:12,209
Get a desiccated rat,
scoop out its insides,

411
00:25:12,277 --> 00:25:14,211
stuff it with plastic explosive.

412
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:18,115
A German sentry in a factory
would think nothing of kicking aside a dead rat.

413
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:20,684
The explosive will blow up
the entire factory.

414
00:25:23,054 --> 00:25:24,755
The SOE are hugely successful.

415
00:25:26,658 --> 00:25:30,160
13,000 agents rally
over a million local resistance fighters

416
00:25:30,228 --> 00:25:32,263
to cause chaos for
the German occupiers.

417
00:25:35,767 --> 00:25:38,602
On the night of D-day itself
in France alone,

418
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:40,771
there were 960 acts of sabotage

419
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:43,173
carried out by the French Resistance

420
00:25:43,241 --> 00:25:45,409
against rail networks
and on the roads

421
00:25:45,477 --> 00:25:48,379
to prevent Germans moving
forwards towards Normandy.

422
00:25:51,182 --> 00:25:53,951
After the war,
Ian Fleming is inspired

423
00:25:54,019 --> 00:25:56,887
by the daring exploits of SOE and MI6

424
00:25:57,789 --> 00:26:00,291
and uses them as plot lines
for the elaborate missions

425
00:26:00,358 --> 00:26:02,226
of his master spy James Bond.

426
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:07,531
The James Bond stories
are uniquely influential

427
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:09,767
in defining the image
of MI6 and its spies.

428
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:15,806
They sell the public a world of espionage
that is glamorous and sexy.

429
00:26:17,509 --> 00:26:19,510
Exotic cocktails,
shaken not stirred.

430
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:23,447
Beautiful women at every turn.

431
00:26:24,482 --> 00:26:26,150
And sharp-suited spies.

432
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:31,755
Fleming's fictional version
of British espionage is so convincing,

433
00:26:31,823 --> 00:26:34,959
the Egyptian Secret Service
are completely taken in by it.

434
00:26:36,528 --> 00:26:39,863
Actually in the 1950s,
the Egyptians believed

435
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:42,399
everything that was
in the James bond book

436
00:26:42,467 --> 00:26:45,102
must be based on reality.

437
00:26:46,071 --> 00:26:49,440
The Egyptian Secret Service
had their man in London

438
00:26:49,507 --> 00:26:53,010
buy up copies of every
one of the James Bond books

439
00:26:53,078 --> 00:26:54,678
so they could analyse it

440
00:26:54,746 --> 00:26:56,647
and try and work out
what bits were real

441
00:26:56,715 --> 00:26:58,315
and what bits weren't real.

442
00:27:00,185 --> 00:27:03,787
Even today, MI6 is inextricable
from the Bond mythology.

443
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:07,191
Much of the public's
knowledge of the Secret Service

444
00:27:07,258 --> 00:27:09,293
comes solely from Fleming's creation.

445
00:27:10,562 --> 00:27:13,030
MI6, which is a secret organisation,

446
00:27:13,098 --> 00:27:16,000
also happens to be one of the most famous
organisations in the world.

447
00:27:16,067 --> 00:27:18,569
But it's the result,
obviously, of the literature.

448
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:20,170
And that can bring problems,

449
00:27:20,238 --> 00:27:22,373
because people sort of misunderstand

450
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,141
what intelligence work is all about.

451
00:27:24,209 --> 00:27:26,477
I was in service for a long time

452
00:27:27,278 --> 00:27:29,246
and I had plenty of exciting moments...

453
00:27:31,082 --> 00:27:32,816
...but they weren't James Bond moments.

454
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:39,123
The reality is that espionage work is neither
loud nor high-profile.

455
00:27:41,092 --> 00:27:44,094
For MI6, discretion and secrecy are key.

456
00:27:45,296 --> 00:27:46,897
Unlike James Bond,
I wasn't able

457
00:27:46,965 --> 00:27:49,433
to walk into a swanky bar in a hotel

458
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:51,468
and announce that
I was Matthew Dunn

459
00:27:51,536 --> 00:27:54,038
and have women
flocking all around me.

460
00:27:54,105 --> 00:27:56,106
We want to work in the shadows.

461
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:59,076
We don't want the flash-bang
aspect of a James Bond movie.

462
00:27:59,878 --> 00:28:01,712
As an MI6 officer,

463
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:04,815
Matthew Dunn was trained in
unarmed combat, explosives,

464
00:28:04,883 --> 00:28:07,451
firearms, exfiltration

465
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:09,987
and a host of other
intelligence techniques.

466
00:28:11,156 --> 00:28:13,957
He's had to use all these skills
at one time or another.

467
00:28:15,927 --> 00:28:18,929
Everything I did was under
what we call alias, assumed identity.

468
00:28:18,997 --> 00:28:21,465
That assumed identity
is not just a name,

469
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:23,967
it would mean you'd have
a passport, bank details.

470
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:26,203
You'd have to have in here

471
00:28:26,271 --> 00:28:29,640
a complete background
to that alias identity.

472
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:33,644
You could be stopped going
through customs just randomly.

473
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:35,913
So if you're taken
into an interview room

474
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:38,449
you've got to be able to
convince the person opposite

475
00:28:38,516 --> 00:28:40,517
that you are the person
you say you are.

476
00:28:40,585 --> 00:28:43,787
That can include which schools you went to,
what's your local pub...

477
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:47,558
you know, small minutiae that
is actually very important.

478
00:28:47,625 --> 00:28:49,193
That's what I did and at peak

479
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:51,729
I was operating under about 14 or 15
different aliases.

480
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:55,733
Dunn was recruited from university.

481
00:28:56,634 --> 00:28:59,103
For most of its history,
the British Secret Service

482
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:01,739
has recruited its spies
from the upper classes.

483
00:29:03,541 --> 00:29:06,810
It's an elitism which would
prove a critical mistake for MI6

484
00:29:07,779 --> 00:29:10,013
and cost the lives of
countless British agents.

485
00:29:11,549 --> 00:29:14,985
It would also severely damage
Britain's special relationship with the US.

486
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:21,391
In the 1930s and '40s,
exclusive St James's clubs

487
00:29:21,459 --> 00:29:23,327
such as White's,
Brooks's and Boodles

488
00:29:24,329 --> 00:29:27,030
are renowned for their links
with British Intelligence.

489
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:29,700
Well, this is clubland.

490
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:31,635
This is what we call clubland.

491
00:29:31,703 --> 00:29:33,804
It's just off Piccadilly,

492
00:29:33,872 --> 00:29:36,140
Buckingham Palace is just over there.

493
00:29:36,207 --> 00:29:40,644
It's the heart of the Establishment at this period
in the early 20th century.

494
00:29:41,379 --> 00:29:43,947
This was the recruiting
ground for MI6.

495
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:49,620
This was also the high society hangout for
James Bond's creator Ian Fleming.

496
00:29:50,522 --> 00:29:53,557
He incorporated his favourite
clubs and upper class bars

497
00:29:53,725 --> 00:29:55,659
into the 007 stories.

498
00:29:55,994 --> 00:29:57,861
Right, well, this is Boodles.

499
00:29:57,929 --> 00:30:00,097
This is, essentially,
James Bond's club.

500
00:30:01,566 --> 00:30:03,100
In the books,
it's called Blades

501
00:30:03,168 --> 00:30:05,369
but Ian Fleming
was a member of Boodles

502
00:30:05,436 --> 00:30:08,472
and he used Boodles as a backdrop,

503
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:10,674
if you like,
for the Bond books.

504
00:30:12,443 --> 00:30:14,745
Officers would conduct
secret meetings

505
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:17,548
behind the closed shutters
of these private clubs.

506
00:30:20,018 --> 00:30:24,121
Even today, members of the
intelligence community use these private spaces.

507
00:30:27,458 --> 00:30:30,327
This is the Reform, this is
one of these hallowed clubs,

508
00:30:31,696 --> 00:30:33,964
places where gentlemen used to gather.

509
00:30:34,532 --> 00:30:37,401
You can imagine people
meeting behind these pillars

510
00:30:38,236 --> 00:30:39,937
or over lunch in the restaurant.

511
00:30:41,372 --> 00:30:43,440
Because they were
from the Establishment,

512
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:46,476
they were regarded as people
who could be trusted.

513
00:30:46,544 --> 00:30:49,713
They were gentlemen. They
knew what they were doing.

514
00:30:52,217 --> 00:30:55,853
In the 1930s, the KGB realise
that they can take advantage

515
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,855
of the cozy relationship

516
00:30:57,922 --> 00:31:01,325
between the British Secret Service and
the British upper classes.

517
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:06,029
They begin to recruit Englishmen willing
to betray their country.

518
00:31:06,097 --> 00:31:08,565
If someone said you were
the right kind of person,

519
00:31:08,633 --> 00:31:10,267
a good chap,
then you were in.

520
00:31:10,335 --> 00:31:12,135
There were no more
security checks than that,

521
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:14,071
no one bothered to look
into your background.

522
00:31:14,138 --> 00:31:15,639
People said,
'He's one of us.'

523
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:17,474
They were wrong and the Soviet Union

524
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:20,110
very, very effectively exploited this

525
00:31:20,178 --> 00:31:23,513
by recruiting people and
turning them against the British Establishment.

526
00:31:24,782 --> 00:31:27,184
Cambridge University was one of the KGB's

527
00:31:27,252 --> 00:31:30,954
most successful hunting
grounds for potential British traitors.

528
00:31:31,589 --> 00:31:33,891
And the most famous of all
was Kim Philby.

529
00:31:34,993 --> 00:31:39,429
Kim Philby became converted
to Communism in Cambridge in the early 1930s.

530
00:31:39,497 --> 00:31:41,865
He believed that the choice
the world faced

531
00:31:41,933 --> 00:31:43,567
was between Fascism
on the one hand

532
00:31:43,635 --> 00:31:45,235
or Communism on the other

533
00:31:45,303 --> 00:31:46,670
and he chose Communism.

534
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,407
Philby was instructed by the KGB

535
00:31:50,475 --> 00:31:52,409
to join the British Secret Service

536
00:31:53,611 --> 00:31:56,947
and then to work his way up
into a position of great influence...

537
00:31:57,015 --> 00:31:59,850
all the time passing secrets
to his Russian contacts.

538
00:32:01,452 --> 00:32:03,287
He proved remarkably effective.

539
00:32:04,689 --> 00:32:08,125
He was the liaison with
Washington at the start of the Cold War,

540
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:10,727
where he was privy to an
enormous range of secrets

541
00:32:10,795 --> 00:32:13,263
of joint operations
that Britain and America

542
00:32:13,331 --> 00:32:15,365
were running against the Soviet Union.

543
00:32:18,736 --> 00:32:22,940
In October, 1949, MI6 and the
CIA send a team into Albania

544
00:32:23,007 --> 00:32:25,042
to try and topple the Communist regime.

545
00:32:27,345 --> 00:32:29,413
The Albanian Army
is waiting for them.

546
00:32:30,748 --> 00:32:34,151
Kim Philby was able to tell
the Soviet Union these operations were going on

547
00:32:34,218 --> 00:32:35,953
and it meant that
the people who were dropped

548
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:39,122
were effectively rounded up
and, in some cases, executed.

549
00:32:41,926 --> 00:32:44,695
You only have to have
one person like that

550
00:32:44,762 --> 00:32:46,797
on the inside betraying you

551
00:32:46,864 --> 00:32:48,665
and a huge amount of what you do

552
00:32:48,733 --> 00:32:51,969
and your colleagues do
is simply undermined.

553
00:32:52,036 --> 00:32:53,870
So, you know,
it's extremely damaging

554
00:32:53,938 --> 00:32:55,906
and a high vulnerability point

555
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:58,375
for a service engaged
in this kind of work.

556
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:03,547
Philby meets his KGB contacts

557
00:33:03,614 --> 00:33:06,783
in the exclusive and rarefied
London suburb of Kensington.

558
00:33:09,687 --> 00:33:13,457
This area of west London is just a mile and a half
from the Soviet Embassy.

559
00:33:14,926 --> 00:33:16,560
The Russians are confident
their meetings

560
00:33:16,627 --> 00:33:19,162
with the traitor Philby
won't be discovered.

561
00:33:19,797 --> 00:33:21,498
They're running rings around MI6.

562
00:33:23,401 --> 00:33:26,870
Around here, one of the most
famous spy sites is Cafe Daquise.

563
00:33:26,938 --> 00:33:29,139
It's a restaurant
where the Cambridge spies

564
00:33:29,207 --> 00:33:31,441
are thought to have come
to eat and to drink.

565
00:33:34,946 --> 00:33:36,847
Near to the cafe is
Holy Trinity Church,

566
00:33:37,749 --> 00:33:40,584
another location that the KGB
use for their dirty work.

567
00:33:41,819 --> 00:33:44,621
So this statue of
St Francis of Assisi

568
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:47,657
was used as a dead letter
drop by the KGB

569
00:33:47,725 --> 00:33:49,693
during the Cold War.

570
00:33:49,761 --> 00:33:53,530
It's a place where a message
would have been hidden round the back of the statue

571
00:33:53,598 --> 00:33:56,500
which could then have been
picked up by a KGB officer,

572
00:33:56,567 --> 00:33:58,902
so the two people
would never have to meet,

573
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:02,072
but information could
be exchanged containing secret intelligence.

574
00:34:04,075 --> 00:34:05,609
Another famous dead letter drop

575
00:34:05,676 --> 00:34:07,878
was at Mount Street Park
in Westminster,

576
00:34:07,945 --> 00:34:09,446
yards from the US embassy.

577
00:34:12,517 --> 00:34:14,718
A KGB agent would draw a chalk mark

578
00:34:14,786 --> 00:34:16,453
on a nearby lamppost

579
00:34:16,521 --> 00:34:19,056
to indicate he was leaving
a message in the park.

580
00:34:24,695 --> 00:34:26,863
A second KGB officer would
remove the mark

581
00:34:28,332 --> 00:34:30,667
and head to the park
to collect the message.

582
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:33,370
The KGB is far more adept,

583
00:34:33,438 --> 00:34:35,505
it's far more cunning,
in some ways.

584
00:34:35,973 --> 00:34:38,575
It's far better at putting
agents inside Britain.

585
00:34:40,344 --> 00:34:43,947
Britain doesn't have
any agents inside the KGB.

586
00:34:44,315 --> 00:34:47,017
It's not able to listen to
their communications in the same way,

587
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:50,554
so it's effectively blind
and deaf against its enemy.

588
00:34:50,621 --> 00:34:52,155
And that's a real disadvantage.

589
00:34:53,724 --> 00:34:56,426
By the 1950s, Kim Philby
comes under suspicion.

590
00:34:57,595 --> 00:35:01,331
Questions are even asked
in the Houses of Parliament about his loyalty.

591
00:35:02,533 --> 00:35:04,167
He holds a press conference

592
00:35:04,235 --> 00:35:06,536
in which he publicly denies
being a traitor.

593
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:11,575
It was a very capable performance

594
00:35:11,642 --> 00:35:13,910
by one of the great liars
in British Intelligence.

595
00:35:15,313 --> 00:35:18,148
Philby protests his innocence
for another ten years.

596
00:35:19,083 --> 00:35:20,550
But by 1965,

597
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:23,220
the weight of evidence
against him is too great

598
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:25,388
and he finally flees to the Soviet Union.

599
00:35:27,391 --> 00:35:30,160
Instead of receiving the
hero's welcome he expects

600
00:35:30,228 --> 00:35:32,462
for all his hard years of
service to the KGB,

601
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:35,665
he is met with suspicion.

602
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:38,401
Stalin actually thought
that they probably

603
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:40,370
might not be what they seemed.

604
00:35:41,572 --> 00:35:44,441
He actually thought
that the Cambridge spies

605
00:35:44,509 --> 00:35:46,309
were so good they couldn't be true.

606
00:35:48,045 --> 00:35:51,314
In Moscow, Philby finds
himself under virtual house arrest.

607
00:35:51,382 --> 00:35:53,183
The KGB won't employ him.

608
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:56,887
The disappointment is too
much and he turns to drink.

609
00:35:56,954 --> 00:35:59,156
In 1988,
he dies a broken man.

610
00:36:00,925 --> 00:36:03,026
Philby's betrayal
is an enormous blow

611
00:36:03,094 --> 00:36:05,695
to MI6's relationship
with the United States

612
00:36:05,763 --> 00:36:08,798
because Philby had enjoyed
such an important position

613
00:36:08,866 --> 00:36:12,035
as the MI6 liaison
with the CIA with Washington

614
00:36:12,103 --> 00:36:16,039
that suddenly America
becomes distrustful of MI6.

615
00:36:16,107 --> 00:36:19,809
It thinks to itself, 'Hang
on a sec, how many more traitors might there be?

616
00:36:19,877 --> 00:36:23,780
Should we be sharing as much
information with MI6 as we were in the past?

617
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:26,616
Are these guys really as good
as we thought they were?'

618
00:36:28,486 --> 00:36:31,555
The British government cover
up the entire Philby fiasco.

619
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:34,758
As far as the public are concerned,

620
00:36:34,825 --> 00:36:38,128
MI6 and its spies are still
the brilliantly heroic characters

621
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:40,197
of the James Bond stories...

622
00:36:41,065 --> 00:36:44,434
tuxedoed men armed with guns
and clever gadgets.

623
00:36:46,337 --> 00:36:48,672
The glamorous exploits
might be fictional

624
00:36:48,739 --> 00:36:50,674
but the spy gadgets are a reality.

625
00:36:51,509 --> 00:36:54,477
MI6 has a whole department
that's dedicated to producing

626
00:36:55,546 --> 00:36:57,280
ingenious gadgets, in many cases.

627
00:36:58,015 --> 00:37:00,317
For example I was given a briefcase

628
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:02,552
that if I flicked
the switches one way,

629
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:05,088
it would turn on
a concealed recorder.

630
00:37:07,425 --> 00:37:11,461
But the ingenuity of MI6 is nothing compared to the
deadly gadgets of the KGB.

631
00:37:14,432 --> 00:37:16,533
On 7th Sept, 1978,

632
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:19,402
London witnesses
the use of a lethal device

633
00:37:20,771 --> 00:37:22,806
in a plot that is
stranger than fiction.

634
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:28,345
Georgi Markov was an
ambitious writer in Bulgaria

635
00:37:28,412 --> 00:37:31,748
who became dissatisfied
with the Bulgarian regime

636
00:37:31,816 --> 00:37:34,384
in spite of having been
at its topmost level.

637
00:37:34,452 --> 00:37:37,854
He went hunting with
the Communist dictator Todor Zhivkov,

638
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:39,956
but defected and came to London.

639
00:37:40,524 --> 00:37:44,494
...in line with the
corrupt nature of the Party and the regime...

640
00:37:45,363 --> 00:37:48,365
Markov was riling the
Communist leadership in Bulgaria

641
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:51,234
with his deeply critical
writings and broadcasts.

642
00:37:51,302 --> 00:37:54,104
We have seen how personality vanishes...

643
00:37:54,171 --> 00:37:57,140
For the Bulgarian regime,
Georgi Markov was probably

644
00:37:57,208 --> 00:37:58,775
their number one public enemy.

645
00:38:02,713 --> 00:38:04,914
It's just another
routine day for Markov

646
00:38:04,982 --> 00:38:08,151
as he makes his way to work
across Waterloo Bridge in London.

647
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:12,422
But within a few hours,
he begins to fell unwell.

648
00:38:13,391 --> 00:38:15,425
The following day,
he is admitted to hospital

649
00:38:15,493 --> 00:38:17,294
suffering massive organ failure.

650
00:38:18,562 --> 00:38:20,430
His doctors have no explanation.

651
00:38:21,332 --> 00:38:23,833
Markov, though, is certain
he has been poisoned.

652
00:38:24,669 --> 00:38:26,670
I went in and saw him.

653
00:38:26,737 --> 00:38:28,972
His words were,
'They're out to get me.

654
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,507
I've been poisoned by the KGB,

655
00:38:30,574 --> 00:38:32,575
there's nothing you can do
about it, I'm going to die.'

656
00:38:34,111 --> 00:38:36,980
Dr Riley is chief medical
officer on call at the time.

657
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:40,483
His colleagues think Markov
is paranoid and crazy.

658
00:38:42,253 --> 00:38:44,621
Only Dr Riley believes
his fantastic claims.

659
00:38:46,123 --> 00:38:49,759
He just was so convincing
and he seemed so genuine

660
00:38:49,827 --> 00:38:52,262
that I thought I'd better
take this seriously.

661
00:38:54,298 --> 00:38:57,667
Markov desperately tries
to work out how he's been poisoned.

662
00:38:58,302 --> 00:39:00,804
The only strange thing
he can remember happening

663
00:39:00,871 --> 00:39:03,673
is at a bus stop on the way
to work that morning.

664
00:39:07,311 --> 00:39:10,780
He just told me about how
he was waiting at a bus stop

665
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:12,782
at the south end of Waterloo Bridge.

666
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:15,552
And he said that he suddenly
felt like a sharp,

667
00:39:15,619 --> 00:39:18,121
stabbing feeling in the back
of his right thigh.

668
00:39:21,492 --> 00:39:23,360
And he turned around,

669
00:39:23,427 --> 00:39:26,796
to see someone there who'd accidentally prodded
him with an umbrella.

670
00:39:29,467 --> 00:39:31,568
Markov's condition
deteriorates quickly

671
00:39:32,803 --> 00:39:34,571
and within three days,
he is dead.

672
00:39:36,607 --> 00:39:38,541
For the first time,
MI6 fear the worst.

673
00:39:40,778 --> 00:39:44,347
Has a foreign agent carried
out an assassination on British soil?

674
00:39:45,483 --> 00:39:48,318
Had someone been given a
real-life license to kill?

675
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:51,654
Everything you're doing
overseas as an operative is illegal,

676
00:39:51,722 --> 00:39:53,823
because espionage is illegal.

677
00:39:54,592 --> 00:39:57,694
So the concept of having
a license to kill is irrelevant.

678
00:39:57,762 --> 00:40:00,797
If you kill somebody,
you can't suddenly pull out a license

679
00:40:00,865 --> 00:40:02,399
and that's gonna be fine.

680
00:40:03,834 --> 00:40:07,470
So the reality is,
there's no need to have a license to kill.

681
00:40:08,706 --> 00:40:11,841
License or not, Markov
believes he's been targeted.

682
00:40:14,211 --> 00:40:16,546
And whoever has attacked him
has left a trace.

683
00:40:18,115 --> 00:40:21,084
When I examined him and found
on the back of his thigh

684
00:40:21,152 --> 00:40:22,952
sort of this puncture wound,

685
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:25,622
I thought, 'Well, perhaps
he has been poisoned.'

686
00:40:27,158 --> 00:40:29,759
Buried inside Markov's leg,
the pathologist discovers

687
00:40:29,827 --> 00:40:32,095
a tiny round pellet
the size of a pinhead.

688
00:40:32,963 --> 00:40:35,532
The microscopic holes drilled
into it are so small,

689
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:37,667
there's only one possible
toxin powerful enough

690
00:40:37,735 --> 00:40:39,803
to have killed in such a minuscule dose.

691
00:40:40,805 --> 00:40:42,405
Ricin.

692
00:40:43,073 --> 00:40:44,941
You can imagine this is the pellet.

693
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:49,045
The theory is that the holes
were sealed with something

694
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:53,583
like gelatine which would
melt at body temperature.

695
00:40:54,618 --> 00:40:57,687
So that once the pellet
is beneath the skin,

696
00:40:57,755 --> 00:41:00,790
the gelatine dissolves
and the toxin leaks out.

697
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:06,896
The pellet was fired into
Markov's leg by an elaborate mechanism

698
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:11,000
most probably hidden inside
the umbrella he saw dropped at the bus stop.

699
00:41:11,602 --> 00:41:14,971
You need a lot of knowledge,
a lot of skill and a lot of expertise

700
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:18,208
to engineer something
like the pellet

701
00:41:18,275 --> 00:41:20,844
containing the ricin
that killed Mr. Markov.

702
00:41:22,847 --> 00:41:26,716
MI6 believe the sophisticated
nature of the pellet and umbrella device

703
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:29,185
point to a state-ordered assassination...

704
00:41:29,787 --> 00:41:32,288
probably the work of the
Bulgarian Secret Service

705
00:41:32,356 --> 00:41:34,257
with help from the KGB.

706
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:38,828
Our own Secret Intelligence
Service must have been

707
00:41:38,896 --> 00:41:41,431
extremely embarrassed
as well as concerned

708
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:45,502
that this sort of attack had been carried
out on Waterloo Bridge

709
00:41:45,569 --> 00:41:47,770
in broad daylight
in the centre of London.

710
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:49,706
It was an incredible affront.

711
00:41:51,575 --> 00:41:53,643
The Markov murder hits the headlines.

712
00:41:53,711 --> 00:41:57,380
Suddenly MI6 finds its
business splashed across the newspapers.

713
00:41:58,415 --> 00:42:01,050
Its secrets are being laid
bare in full public view.

714
00:42:02,453 --> 00:42:04,153
By the late 1970s,

715
00:42:04,221 --> 00:42:07,423
it seems Britain's Secret Service isn't
very secret anymore.

716
00:42:09,593 --> 00:42:12,662
It was an open secret where
the offices of MI6 were based

717
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:15,398
at Century house just over
the river in Lambeth.

718
00:42:15,466 --> 00:42:19,235
It was supposed to be secret,
there was no plaque outside saying MI6,

719
00:42:19,303 --> 00:42:21,905
but all the bus conductors
in Lambeth used to say,

720
00:42:21,972 --> 00:42:24,574
'Spies alight here,
spies get off the bus here,'

721
00:42:24,642 --> 00:42:27,710
as a joke because everyone
knew where MI6 was based.

722
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:31,414
After the disasters
of the early Cold War,

723
00:42:32,149 --> 00:42:33,950
MI6's luck finally changes.

724
00:42:40,925 --> 00:42:44,460
They persuade senior KGB
member, Oleg Gordievsky,

725
00:42:44,528 --> 00:42:46,162
to turn double agent

726
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:48,364
and leak Russian secrets
to the British.

727
00:43:02,813 --> 00:43:05,348
Gordievsky quickly climbs
the KGB career ladder

728
00:43:06,684 --> 00:43:09,719
and in 1982, he's posted
to a prime position

729
00:43:09,787 --> 00:43:11,688
at the Soviet Embassy in London.

730
00:43:13,223 --> 00:43:16,526
Oleg Gordievsky was recruited
by the British at an important moment

731
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:19,329
when Britain and America
did not have many spies

732
00:43:19,396 --> 00:43:22,398
who could reveal the inner
thoughts, inner workings

733
00:43:22,466 --> 00:43:26,202
of the KGB leadership and
of the leadership of the Soviet Union as a whole.

734
00:43:27,538 --> 00:43:30,073
The MI6 officer in charge
of handling Gordievsky

735
00:43:31,141 --> 00:43:32,909
is none other than John Scarlett.

736
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:37,780
He was turned into a really
reliable and effective

737
00:43:38,882 --> 00:43:41,718
and committed agent,
if you like, or double agent.

738
00:43:43,354 --> 00:43:46,489
You can only do it if you
trust the double agent concerned

739
00:43:47,358 --> 00:43:50,526
and by definition, trusting double agents is not
a straightforward business.

740
00:43:52,529 --> 00:43:55,932
But the British become
convinced that Gordievsky is genuine.

741
00:43:57,468 --> 00:44:01,571
During lunch breaks, he slips
out of the Soviet Embassy to meet with Scarlett.

742
00:44:04,041 --> 00:44:07,877
Very occasionally, he is
also able to smuggle out top-secret documents.

743
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:29,265
Gordievsky is risking
his life meeting Scarlett.

744
00:44:31,802 --> 00:44:34,270
If the KGB catch a traitor,
there is no reprieve.

745
00:44:36,874 --> 00:44:38,741
They will execute him.

746
00:45:02,032 --> 00:45:03,966
Gordievsky's most important moment

747
00:45:04,034 --> 00:45:05,902
is to come in late 1983.

748
00:45:07,971 --> 00:45:09,672
Unknown to the public,

749
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:12,608
for a brief moment,
the world is on the brink of nuclear war.

750
00:45:14,912 --> 00:45:18,748
Tension was increasing
between the West and the Soviet Union

751
00:45:19,817 --> 00:45:22,652
when Ronald Reagan was
talking about the evil empire

752
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:26,689
and when the Soviet Union
feared there could be a surprise attack.

753
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:31,561
NATO forces are preparing
for a Europe-wide exercise

754
00:45:31,628 --> 00:45:33,696
that simulates a nuclear attack.

755
00:45:34,264 --> 00:45:38,201
Everyone from the Joint Chiefs of Staff
to the President is to be involved.

756
00:45:40,270 --> 00:45:43,306
But the Soviet Union thinks
the exercise is merely cover

757
00:45:43,373 --> 00:45:45,975
for the West to launch
a real strike against them.

758
00:45:48,078 --> 00:45:50,947
The world is unwittingly
heading towards nuclear war.

759
00:45:52,850 --> 00:45:55,418
Messages went out
to the KGB station saying,

760
00:45:55,486 --> 00:45:58,855
'You must be on high alert
for the possibility

761
00:45:58,922 --> 00:46:01,357
of the West launching
a strike against us.'

762
00:46:02,993 --> 00:46:06,596
And the Soviet Union actually
raised its state of alert in readiness.

763
00:46:10,033 --> 00:46:13,436
In London, Gordievsky sees
the aggressive messages

764
00:46:13,504 --> 00:46:16,773
from the Russian leadership
and immediately warns MI6.

765
00:46:30,587 --> 00:46:32,054
To pacify Moscow,

766
00:46:32,122 --> 00:46:34,590
the US immediately
scale down the exercise

767
00:46:34,658 --> 00:46:37,026
and remove any involvement
by the President.

768
00:46:38,061 --> 00:46:39,662
The West suddenly realised

769
00:46:39,730 --> 00:46:42,365
just how edgy the situation was

770
00:46:42,432 --> 00:46:44,667
and just how volatile
and dangerous things were.

771
00:46:48,605 --> 00:46:50,807
That really helped
London and Washington

772
00:46:50,874 --> 00:46:52,341
think much more carefully

773
00:46:52,409 --> 00:46:56,112
about how they managed that
period of quite high tension

774
00:46:56,180 --> 00:46:58,181
during the latter part
of the Cold War.

775
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:02,218
Gordievsky has proved his worth

776
00:47:03,353 --> 00:47:05,087
but in 1985,
his luck runs out.

777
00:47:15,699 --> 00:47:18,367
Though free to return
to his Moscow home,

778
00:47:18,435 --> 00:47:20,570
Gordievsky knows his days are numbered.

779
00:47:22,039 --> 00:47:23,873
He is closely watched
at every turn.

780
00:47:25,976 --> 00:47:29,111
In desperation, he asks MI6
to smuggle him out of the country.

781
00:47:31,715 --> 00:47:35,017
His request goes straight
to Number 10 Downing street

782
00:47:35,085 --> 00:47:37,119
where Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher

783
00:47:37,187 --> 00:47:40,056
authorises MI6 to engineer
a daring escape plan.

784
00:47:42,492 --> 00:47:44,260
The rescue date is set.

785
00:47:47,564 --> 00:47:50,399
On 20th July, 1985,

786
00:47:50,467 --> 00:47:54,503
Gordievsky waits at a pre-arranged spot near
the Soviet-Finnish border.

787
00:47:55,806 --> 00:47:59,442
At precisely 2pm, a car pulls
up on the isolated road.

788
00:48:00,911 --> 00:48:02,678
It is the British Secret Service.

789
00:48:04,514 --> 00:48:06,816
Inside are a man and
two women with a child.

790
00:48:08,185 --> 00:48:12,355
MI6 is hoping a family outing
will provide the perfect cover for the escape.

791
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:26,102
With Gordievsky in the trunk,
the car speeds towards the border.

792
00:48:28,605 --> 00:48:30,673
The Soviet frontier is heavily guarded.

793
00:48:34,177 --> 00:48:36,145
And Oleg can hear search dogs outside.

794
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:42,285
If the dogs sniff him out,
he's done for.

795
00:49:07,678 --> 00:49:10,513
The strong smell from the
diapers distracts the dogs

796
00:49:11,348 --> 00:49:13,215
and Gordievsky remains undetected.

797
00:49:15,752 --> 00:49:18,321
Finally,
after two tense hours,

798
00:49:18,388 --> 00:49:20,623
he hears the signal
he has been waiting for.

799
00:49:37,007 --> 00:49:40,142
The car has reached neutral
Finland and safety.

800
00:49:44,715 --> 00:49:47,383
MI6 has repaid Gordievsky's loyalty

801
00:49:47,451 --> 00:49:49,518
and ensured his freedom.

802
00:49:49,586 --> 00:49:52,555
Oleg Antonovich Gordievsky
is a well-known public case

803
00:49:53,824 --> 00:49:56,425
and it is not possible to overstate

804
00:49:57,294 --> 00:50:00,963
the contribution he made to our national
well being and interests.

805
00:50:04,568 --> 00:50:08,270
When the Soviet Union
crumbles after the fall of the Berlin Wall,

806
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:12,274
it seems like Britain and the
West's game of cat and mouse with Russia is over.

807
00:50:14,611 --> 00:50:17,146
But only 20 years later,
the Russians are back

808
00:50:17,214 --> 00:50:19,582
and playing the spying game
with a vengeance.

809
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:25,488
On 1st November, 2006,

810
00:50:25,555 --> 00:50:28,024
dissident Alexander Litvinenko
is fatally poisoned

811
00:50:28,091 --> 00:50:29,992
at the Millennium Hotel in London,

812
00:50:30,927 --> 00:50:33,729
when his tea is laced
with Polonium-210,

813
00:50:33,797 --> 00:50:35,798
a radioactive substance.

814
00:50:36,733 --> 00:50:38,834
It's become clear
that some of the old threats

815
00:50:38,902 --> 00:50:40,870
and some of the old dangers remain.

816
00:50:40,937 --> 00:50:43,806
You've seen the resurgence
of some of the concerns

817
00:50:43,874 --> 00:50:46,442
about Russian Intelligence
operating in London,

818
00:50:46,510 --> 00:50:48,144
about Russia recruiting spies,

819
00:50:48,211 --> 00:50:50,379
even, it's thought,
the Russian state

820
00:50:50,447 --> 00:50:52,681
killing dissidents
on the streets of London

821
00:50:52,749 --> 00:50:54,817
in the case of Alexander Litvinenko.

822
00:50:56,486 --> 00:51:01,057
The murder of Litvinenko
wasn't just the KGB executing a troublesome dissident.

823
00:51:01,124 --> 00:51:03,526
It was the start of an entirely new level
of violence

824
00:51:03,593 --> 00:51:05,461
in the world of espionage.

825
00:51:07,464 --> 00:51:10,833
Information came out showing
that Alexander Litvinenko

826
00:51:10,901 --> 00:51:12,768
had actually been a paid agent of MI6,

827
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:15,471
and he'd then been assassinated,

828
00:51:15,539 --> 00:51:18,174
it's thought, on the orders
of the Russian state,

829
00:51:18,241 --> 00:51:20,409
by the Russian Intelligence Services,

830
00:51:20,477 --> 00:51:22,545
using radioactive polonium.

831
00:51:22,612 --> 00:51:25,448
So, in a way, you can see,
though the Cold War is gone,

832
00:51:25,515 --> 00:51:28,417
the spy games between Britain and Russia

833
00:51:28,485 --> 00:51:30,319
are still going on today.

834
00:51:30,387 --> 00:51:33,589
The Russians have broken
an unwritten rule in the spy game.

835
00:51:34,391 --> 00:51:37,693
They have killed another
country's spy, an MI6 agent.

836
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:41,530
The KGB may be no more

837
00:51:41,598 --> 00:51:43,966
but the new Russian Intelligence Service

838
00:51:44,034 --> 00:51:47,002
is just as deadly and operating on
the streets of London.

839
00:52:05,522 --> 00:52:08,190
Today, MI6 finds itself
with a wider mission:

840
00:52:09,126 --> 00:52:12,261
preventing cyber attacks
on Government organisations,

841
00:52:12,329 --> 00:52:14,296
stopping the spread of nuclear, chemical

842
00:52:14,364 --> 00:52:15,998
and biological weapons,

843
00:52:16,066 --> 00:52:17,833
as well as fighting terrorism.

844
00:52:19,169 --> 00:52:20,669
It gradually became clear

845
00:52:20,737 --> 00:52:22,705
there was a new problem out there

846
00:52:22,772 --> 00:52:24,874
from international terrorism,

847
00:52:24,941 --> 00:52:26,308
not just a theoretical problem,

848
00:52:26,376 --> 00:52:28,210
actually a physical threat.

849
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:34,483
At least 20 foreign state are known
to be actively targeting the United Kingdom.

850
00:52:35,085 --> 00:52:36,819
MI6 is needed now more than ever.

851
00:52:38,722 --> 00:52:41,557
My entire experience
up until the present day

852
00:52:41,625 --> 00:52:44,660
is we face situations where
we need to be well informed.

853
00:52:44,728 --> 00:52:47,963
Self-evidently,
the best form of defence

854
00:52:48,031 --> 00:52:52,001
against plots and attacks is
to know about it in advance,

855
00:52:52,769 --> 00:52:54,436
and that is a matter
of good intelligence.

856
00:52:55,672 --> 00:52:58,641
As long as there are people
who want to do Britain harm,

857
00:52:58,708 --> 00:53:00,442
Britain will need a secret service.

858
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:02,178
As long as there
are threats out there,

859
00:53:02,245 --> 00:53:05,314
whether those threats
are now from cyberspace and terrorists

860
00:53:05,382 --> 00:53:07,449
rather than the Soviet Union,

861
00:53:07,517 --> 00:53:10,786
then we'll need spies to try
and understand those threats,

862
00:53:10,854 --> 00:53:14,924
to get inside them,
to understand what your enemy's intentions are.

863
00:53:17,127 --> 00:53:20,329
Because the United Kingdom is
such a high priority target,

864
00:53:20,397 --> 00:53:22,498
the British Intelligence and Security Services

865
00:53:22,566 --> 00:53:25,868
have a budget in excess
of $3 billion to fight hostile forces.

866
00:53:29,005 --> 00:53:33,876
I largely suspect there are
far more spies in London

867
00:53:33,944 --> 00:53:37,479
and in Europe now than there
were during the Cold War.

868
00:53:37,547 --> 00:53:41,617
London will always be
the perfect place for spies to hide

869
00:53:41,685 --> 00:53:44,386
and pass unseen among
the millions of visitors.

870
00:53:44,821 --> 00:53:46,622
Of course, I would say
this, wouldn't I?

871
00:53:46,690 --> 00:53:50,259
But I genuinely,
honestly cannot envisage a circumstance

872
00:53:50,327 --> 00:53:53,929
where our country will not
need an effective intelligence service.

873
00:53:54,731 --> 00:53:56,765
I've seen the importance
of the service

874
00:53:56,833 --> 00:53:58,867
and the role it plays increase,

875
00:53:58,935 --> 00:54:00,703
rather than the other way around.

876
00:54:02,439 --> 00:54:05,407
The service has continued
to work, day in, day out

877
00:54:05,475 --> 00:54:07,643
since 1st October, 1909.

878
00:54:08,245 --> 00:54:11,080
One operation leads to another operation,
leads to another operation,

879
00:54:11,147 --> 00:54:12,281
that's how it is.
