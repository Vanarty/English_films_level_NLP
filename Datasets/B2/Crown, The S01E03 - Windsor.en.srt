1
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:16,400
<i> Gina! Gina! Ella!</i>

2
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,680
-Gina! Carina! Ella!
-Gina! Carina! Ella!

3
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,480
Gina! Carina!

4
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:32,640
Gina! Carina!

5
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:35,640
Ella! Ella!

6
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:01,520
<i> Hello, Winston, this is Operations.</i>

7
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,960
<i>-Are you hearing me?</i>
-Hear you clearly.

8
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,600
<i>Stand by for testing.</i>

9
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:09,120
-Testing now.
<i>-Testing five, four, three, two, one.</i>

10
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,760
Mummy.

11
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,960
I've come to make a final representation.

12
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:30,880
And to beseech you not to do this.

13
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,960
I wish to address my people.
It's my right.

14
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:36,880
You have forfeited that right.

15
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,480
There are things I wish to say.

16
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,720
In which capacity?
You're no longer their king.

17
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,160
As a private individual.

18
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,800
Oh, no one wants to hear
from a private individual.

19
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:48,440
Well, I beg to differ.
The newspapers are for me.

20
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:51,600
The best thing for everyone
would be if you said your goodbyes

21
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,800
quietly, privately,
and disappeared into the night.

22
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,680
Preferably never to return.

23
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,440
-I didn't say that.
-But you thought it.

24
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,480
Admit it.

25
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,840
Elizabeth! Margaret! Come inside!

26
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:21,080
<i> This is Windsor Castle.</i>

27
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:25,280
<i>There follows an important announcement</i>
<i>from his Royal Highness,</i>

28
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,640
<i>the Duke of Windsor.</i>

29
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:31,600
A few hours ago, I discharged my last duty

30
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,920
as King and Emperor.

31
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,960
And, now that I have been succeeded
by my brother,

32
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,680
the Duke of York,

33
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:48,200
my first words must be to declare
my allegiance to him.

34
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,640
This I do with all my heart.

35
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,120
Come along, girls.

36
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,640
<i>You all know the reasons which have</i>
<i>impelled me to renounce the throne.</i>

37
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:02,000
<i>-I have found it impossible to carry...</i>
-Girls. Girls!

38
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:07,760
<i>...the heavy burden of responsibility,</i>
<i>and to discharge my duties as King,</i>

39
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,720
as I would wish to do,

40
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:17,280
without the help and support
of the woman I love.

41
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,120
<i>This decision has been made less difficult</i>
<i>to me by the sure knowledge</i>

42
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:25,080
<i>that my brother</i>
<i>has one matchless blessing...</i>

43
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:28,920
-Come in. Both of you.
<i>-...enjoyed by so many of you,</i>

44
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
<i>and not bestowed on me.</i>

45
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:36,400
<i>A happy home, with his wife and children.</i>

46
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,000
<i>And now we all have a new king.</i>

47
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:48,160
<i>I wish him, and you, his people,</i>
<i>happiness and prosperity...</i>

48
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,360
<i>with all my heart.</i>

49
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,120
<i>God bless you all.</i>

50
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,760
<i>God save the King.</i>

51
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,640
All right, Charles, all right. Stop it.

52
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:20,040
Well... good luck, darling.

53
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,240
Thank you.

54
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,920
And thank you for all this.
It looks splendid.

55
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,760
This is the first proper home
I've ever had.

56
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,640
-Tommy.
-Good morning, Your Majesty.

57
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,880
-You tracked me down.
-Slightly, ma'am.

58
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,600
If Your Majesty has no objection,

59
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,600
I thought we might attend
to the Cabinet papers

60
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,720
after your meeting with Their Majesties.
Your schedule allows for 20 minutes.

61
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,400
-For the papers?
-No, ma'am,

62
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:04,960
20 minutes with Their Majesties,
then directly on to the paperwork.

63
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,400
And then?

64
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:10,920
Things will become more manageable
once everything settles down.

65
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,840
Will it?

66
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:15,200
And once the Palace
is your main residence.

67
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:21,160
Our understanding is that he is
arriving at Southampton as we speak.

68
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,360
- Alone?
- We believe so, ma'am.

69
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,480
Hm. That's something.

70
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:33,800
Some last minute adjustments
to the funeral arrangements.

71
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:37,360
If you are in agreement, ma'am,
we thought that the Duke of Windsor

72
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,480
should join the Dukes of Gloucester,
Kent and Edinburgh.

73
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:44,240
But that'd be the row behind me.
Breathing down my neck.

74
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,880
We could, if Her Majesty likes,
increase the distance,

75
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,480
put him back a few rows.

76
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,120
Any chance that could stretch
to being on the steps outside the chapel?

77
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,600
I'm sorry, I know he's your son.

78
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:58,720
A son who gave up the throne
and, effectively, killed my other son.

79
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Why not put him there?
Close to the Prime Minister?

80
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
-Thank you, ma'am.
-Cry Baby.

81
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,080
-What?
-It's what he calls Winston.

82
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:21,560
He and his wife have
nasty little nicknames for all of us.

83
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,400
I'll tell you yours, if you ask me nicely.

84
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,040
No, thank you.

85
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,880
Shirley Temple.

86
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,400
Ready, sir.

87
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:09,040
<i> This is indeed</i>
<i>a sad arrival in my country.</i>

88
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:16,000
<i>I have crossed the Atlantic</i>
<i>for the funeral of a dear brother,</i>

89
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:19,400
<i>and to comfort Her Majesty, Queen Mary.</i>

90
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,480
My heart goes out
to the widowed Queen Mother

91
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,960
and her two daughters in their grief.

92
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,640
Thank you.

93
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,840
-Down there, look!
-Right, that's enough. Look sharp!

94
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,000
His Royal Highness,
the Duke of Windsor, Your Majesty.

95
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,280
Dear Mama.

96
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,640
Poor Bertie.

97
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,440
So young.

98
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,280
One can only be thankful
for all the years one had him.

99
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,240
So wonderfully thoughtful and caring.

100
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:32,880
An angel to his mother, wife and children.

101
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,160
I honestly believe
he never thought of himself at all.

102
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:43,400
He really was the perfect son.

103
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:49,400
I can't imagine how difficult
it must be for you.

104
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:54,040
You've been very much
in our thoughts and prayers.

105
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,320
Ours?

106
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,240
You'd be wise not to mention
that woman's name for the next few days.

107
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:02,080
-I mentioned no name.
-The implication was enough.

108
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,680
If you say so.

109
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:07,160
I offer that in the spirit
of maternal advice

110
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:11,720
that you may emerge from this trip with
any remaining respect or affection at all.

111
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,480
I had hoped all this might wait.

112
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,960
I'm afraid not, ma'am.

113
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,040
I understand.

114
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,800
Shall we?

115
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:59,560
Now, the top sheet is simply a summary
of all the contents of the box.

116
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:03,840
And we have in this case,
a five power conference first. See...

117
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,800
-That's this one?
-Yes.

118
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:08,440
-So this...
-More detail.

119
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,960
-So, we start with this.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

120
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,560
- He's here.
- He's here!

121
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:38,600
Don't rush, darling. It'll take him
an hour to get to the front door.

122
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,720
And then an hour to get through
the bloody thing!

123
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,200
Now, don't forget
the two things we discussed.

124
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,240
-I won't.
-The children keeping my surname.

125
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,320
-Yes.
-And us staying here in Clarence House,

126
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,840
not moving to Buckingham Palace.
Both very important.

127
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,000
I know. I won't forget.

128
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,920
-And don't be nervous.
-I'm not nervous.

129
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,040
You look nervous.

130
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,600
Be firm. Just lay down the law.

131
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:03,400
I know he's Winston Churchill
and all that, but remember who you are.

132
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,360
-You're--
-Nobody.

133
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,800
The Queen of England.

134
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,880
Don't let me overrun.

135
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,640
The Prime Minister, Your Majesty.

136
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,000
Your Majesty.

137
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:55,000
I so looked forward every Tuesday
to my audiences with your...

138
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,840
dear papa.

139
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:02,840
His late Majesty was a hero

140
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,600
to me and to all his people.

141
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,240
Thank you.

142
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:14,120
Do sit down, Prime Minister.

143
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:19,360
I've ordered tea.
Or something stronger, perhaps.

144
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,800
Oh, dear. Did no one explain?

145
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:28,800
The Sovereign never offers
a Prime Minister refreshment.

146
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,760
Nor a chair.

147
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:33,520
The precedent set
by your great-great-grandmother

148
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,920
was to keep us standing
like Privy Councillors.

149
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,600
To waste time is a grievous sin.

150
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,720
And, if there is one thing I have learned
in 52 years of public service,

151
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:50,600
it is that there is no problem so complex,
nor crisis so grave,

152
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:56,680
that it cannot be satisfactorily resolved
within 20 minutes. So...

153
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,160
shall we make a start?

154
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,760
<i> She's in with the PM now.</i>

155
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,880
And I made it abundantly clear
how important it was

156
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,600
that she and the children take your name.

157
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:13,640
<i> It's your name too.</i>
<i>It's the name I gave you.</i>

158
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:20,280
Having Mountbatten
as the name of the Royal house,

159
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:25,480
having your first-born son, Charles,
as the first Mountbatten king...

160
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:29,200
<i>Well, that would be some achievement,</i>
<i>wouldn't it?</i>

161
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:34,600
Now, I would like to discuss
your coronation.

162
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,560
Yes.

163
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:39,440
I have a proposed date which has been
run past Cabinet and approved.

164
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:44,600
-Summer, I hope.
-Indeed. Next year.

165
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,720
Next year? Why the delay?

166
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,840
For your benefit entirely.

167
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:55,480
A long period
between accession and coronation

168
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,960
was of great value to your father.

169
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:00,600
He had five months.

170
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:04,400
You're proposing I have 16
before I am crowned.

171
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,720
Yes.

172
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:14,760
That would take anyone
weeks to read...

173
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:18,960
-Anyway, thanks for the drink.
-Thank you, Jock.

174
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,440
-Sir.
-Sir.

175
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:26,200
Foreign office first,
let's surprise Anthony.

176
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,480
- And?
- Nothing.

177
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:35,840
We discussed the end of rationing
of sugar, butter and meat,

178
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:39,360
the situation in Korea,
and the date of my coronation.

179
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,560
I barely got a word in.

180
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,560
Of course not,
the man barely draws breath.

181
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,920
-You have to butt in.
-You can't!

182
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,880
Not in the private audience.

183
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,080
So, what about the issues
I asked you to address?

184
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,480
-I will find the right time.
-When?

185
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,360
-Why would he do that?
-What?

186
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,960
Why would he want to delay my coronation?

187
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:00,560
What are you talking about? What--
Elizabeth!

188
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:31,640
I realize we've had our differences
in the past.

189
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,880
If you'll allow me.

190
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:41,520
But, for now, let us think only
of what we have in common.

191
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:47,880
You've lost a husband and father,

192
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,400
I a brother.

193
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:58,880
Let us be united in grief,
on equal terms, for someone we all loved.

194
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:04,760
I'll be here for a few days
after the funeral

195
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,760
before I return to New York.

196
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:11,440
Perhaps we might find time
to see one another.

197
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,760
For lunch, or a walk.

198
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,360
Yes. I'd like that very much.

199
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,760
Your Majesties.

200
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:32,120
- We must go, girls.
- So soon?

201
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,440
Yes, to Westminster Hall.

202
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,040
To see Papa.

203
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:52,680
With this family, when you're in,
you're never quite sure that you're in.

204
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:55,400
But when you're out,
there's no doubt at all.

205
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,000
You're out.

206
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,400
Why can't you just be civil to him, Mummy?

207
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:08,240
Let bygones be bygones.

208
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:12,240
Sixteen years since the abdication,
and he was close to Papa.

209
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,800
Because the man is a monster!

210
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,480
The responsibility of becoming king
killed your father

211
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:22,520
and I will never forgive his selfishness
and weakness in passing on the burden.

212
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:28,880
He has done nothing for this family.

213
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,120
And don't be fooled by his obsequiousness.

214
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,680
The only reason he's even civil to us
is because he wants to leech off us

215
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:40,160
with a rich allowance to keep
that Jezebel divorcee of his in the manner

216
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,720
to which she's become accustomed.

217
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,440
Well, I've spoken to the lawyers

218
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,320
and we have a little surprise
in store for them.

219
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,160
<i>My dear darling Peaches...</i>

220
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,600
<i>They say hell is an inferno.</i>

221
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:59,560
<i>What a sunless, frozen hell</i>
<i>we both escaped in England.</i>

222
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:05,320
<i>And what a bunch of ice-veined monsters</i>
<i>my family are.</i>

223
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,480
<i>How cold and thin-lipped,</i>

224
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:11,000
<i>how dumpy and plain.</i>

225
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:13,480
<i>How joyless and loveless.</i>

226
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:19,400
<i>The way Cookie treated me looking</i>
<i>down at me through her dumpy nose,</i>

227
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:23,880
<i>it was as much as I could do</i>
<i>not to let her have it with both barrels.</i>

228
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,880
<i>And Shirley Temple,</i>
<i>who has the rank now</i>

229
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:29,720
<i>to silence her common mother,</i>
<i>sadly, has no mind of her own.</i>

230
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,160
<i>But I remained civil</i>
<i>because I am following your advice...</i>

231
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:42,000
<i>to keep them on side,</i>
<i>keep a foot in the door...</i>

232
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:46,200
<i>and see what we can get out</i>
<i>of the wretched circus.</i>

233
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:53,640
<i>Perhaps even a raise on the allowance,</i>
<i>who knows?</i>

234
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:58,880
<i>It's the only revenge I can think of</i>
<i>for the insult of your non-invitation,</i>

235
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:02,520
<i>to drain their coffers to our benefit.</i>

236
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,360
<i>Thinking always of you</i>

237
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:17,040
<i>and counting the minutes</i>
<i>until I am back in your arms.</i>

238
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,600
<i>Your loving David.</i>

239
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:23,480
...and therefore commit his body
to the ground.

240
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:31,280
Earth to earth,
ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

241
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:37,600
In sure and certain hope
of the resurrection to eternal life,

242
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:40,880
through our Lord Jesus Christ.

243
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:18,800
-What is that thing?
-Oh, I inherited it from my grandfather.

244
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:22,600
Well, as you know, Kaiser Wilhelm
was not blessed with a normal physique.

245
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:25,000
No, the withered arm.

246
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:28,640
Ah, but he loved to shoot,
so modifications had to be made.

247
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:36,240
They didn't modify a shotgun,
they modified a cannon.

248
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,400
You are a cheat, Hannover.

249
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:55,200
<i> I realize that,</i>
<i>beyond these walls, the country mourns,</i>

250
00:24:55,280 --> 00:25:00,520
struggles under a program
of austerity and rationing

251
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:03,240
but, what to do?

252
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:06,200
It might all appear indulgent

253
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:10,960
but, in keeping the estate
and the local community going,

254
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:14,800
we are all doing our share tonight
for the economy.

255
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:18,320
So, let us start with a toast.

256
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:27,440
- To His late Majesty, the King.
- The King.

257
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:34,520
- And, the Queen that has succeeded him.
- The Queen.

258
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,960
And to our generous host.

259
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:39,640
And the Royal house
that is now in his name.

260
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:42,320
To our host and the Royal house.

261
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:47,320
- To the Royal house Mountbatten.
- To the Royal house Mountbatten.

262
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,560
Right, come on, then.
You can do it.

263
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:58,880
Kick it back.

264
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,800
Kick it back, boy. Go on.

265
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:08,920
- It's not going to bite you. Kick it.
- Ah, it's a Burnley centre back.

266
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,720
Tell me,
do you play football with your boy?

267
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:14,440
-When I get to see him, yeah. Rugby.
-Rugby? Chance'd be a fine thing.

268
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:16,840
This one doesn't seem to want
to do anything but dream.

269
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:20,440
Ah. Your old man struggling a bit, is he?

270
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,200
Well, come on then.
Show him how it's done.

271
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:25,640
Right. Come on then, Charles.
Let's give you something to aim at.

272
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,800
That thing's been buzzing around
all morning.

273
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,520
Right between his trousers.

274
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,960
Yup. Taking aerial photographs
for some magazine.

275
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:38,080
-Oh, is that right?
-Mm-hm.

276
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,080
It was always my dream
to join the Air Force.

277
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,000
But Dickie put me in the Navy.

278
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,160
He felt the social connections
would be better.

279
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:52,640
Hm. Judging by where you ended up,
I'd say the plan worked.

280
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:56,720
- Ha.
- Come on, Charles. Bash it.

281
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:01,480
Not bloody bad, Charles. Not bloody bad.

282
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:04,240
-No, Daddy, not in the bushes!
-In the bushes he goes!

283
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:09,280
No, Daddy! Not the bushes!

284
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:14,520
Right, Charlie Boy, here we go.
I'm going to teach you...

285
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,360
Come on, then!

286
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,000
<i> Oh, it's vile.</i>

287
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:01,560
Tommy Lascelles comes up to me
at the funeral, of all places,

288
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:06,160
asks me for a word then tells me,
to my face, "Do you credit it?"

289
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:10,080
I come all this way,
back to this gaping wound of a country,

290
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:14,640
forbidden to bring my own wife,
to pay respects to my dear, late brother

291
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:18,800
and they compound an already traumatic
and painful trip with this humiliation!

292
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,880
The timing does seem
particularly unfortunate.

293
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,360
It's an outrage!

294
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:28,480
-How much is the allowance?
-Ten thousand a year.

295
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:31,520
The agreement between Bertie and me
was that I would give up everything

296
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:35,480
and go into exile and keep a low profile
in return for a pension

297
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:39,440
that was clearly meant to be
for the term of my whole life, not his!

298
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:42,600
Now he's barely cold
and Cookie turns off the bloody tap!

299
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:45,720
-How dare she?
-You don't know that it was her.

300
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:48,280
-Of course it was her.
-And don't call her that.

301
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:51,040
Why not?
She's fat, common, and looks like a cook.

302
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,480
Did they offer any justification?

303
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:59,320
Oh, that it would appear insensitive
for a member of the extended Royal family

304
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:02,440
to be seen to be rewarded
and live in luxury.

305
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:04,040
Extended Royal family!

306
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:07,360
I was the most senior member
of that family. The King!

307
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,720
Now, we barely make ends meet!
Every day is a struggle.

308
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:14,800
You live in great style
from what I've heard.

309
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:18,440
Perhaps you should take a leaf
out of your late brother's book.

310
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:23,240
-He was frugal, you know.
-He was born frugal. In every department.

311
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:27,120
And that frugality
earned him great favour.

312
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,680
And he passed it on
to the women in his family.

313
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,480
Who just spent 70,000
renovating Clarence House,

314
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:35,800
so no lectures, please,
about the frugality of the new Queen.

315
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:38,800
-That was her husband.
-What, the foundling?

316
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,120
-Don't call him that.
-Why not?

317
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:44,720
I'd call him by his name, if he had one.

318
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:53,320
His Royal Highness, Prince Ernst August
of Hanover, Your Majesty.

319
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,200
-He's here.
-What?

320
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:59,360
He apologizes for the lack of warning,
but said it was important.

321
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,440
All right.
You'd better show him in.

322
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,000
Ah...

323
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:16,880
Dear Aunt, forgive the intrusion.

324
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,800
I come directly from Broadlands.

325
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,720
What were you doing there?

326
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:24,120
Please tell me you weren't
shooting, one day after the funeral.

327
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:28,640
-Oh, <i>meine liebe</i> Ernst.
-I assure you the sport was very limited.

328
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:32,360
And your late son was in our thoughts
the whole time.

329
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:35,920
Anyway, in the evening,
we gathered for dinner.

330
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,600
The food is normally quite good
at Broadlands.

331
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:41,760
-Outstanding!
-Especially the duck, from memory.

332
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,360
-With oranges.
-Rum-soaked raisins.

333
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:46,680
Oh! A Prussian recipe.

334
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:50,640
Spaetzle, too. Remarkable!
Crispy, with cheese and breadcrumbs.

335
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,960
- Mmm. Delicious!
- Go on.

336
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:59,240
Yes.
So, after dinner, our host started to brag

337
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:02,360
about how the Royal house
would soon be in his name.

338
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,880
Nonsense.

339
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:07,880
The Royal Warrant of 1917
established the House of Windsor.

340
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:11,000
-Ah.
-My late husband presided over it himself.

341
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:15,080
But the name Windsor would only be carried
by the male descendants.

342
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:18,560
It did not take into account
the female descendants.

343
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,400
They would take the name
from their husbands

344
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,680
-which, in this case, would mean--
-Mountbatten!

345
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:25,000
Well...

346
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:29,560
-He had us raising glasses to it.
-Glasses containing what?

347
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:34,800
-Champagne.
-You were drinking champagne

348
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:39,000
the day after my son's funeral?

349
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:57,520
Come in.

350
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,680
I had to see you.

351
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:09,480
Come in.

352
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:19,480
I got home last night
to find this on the kitchen table.

353
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,880
She's gone.

354
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,000
All her belongings have gone.

355
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:46,480
I'm so sorry.

356
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,400
No, you're not.

357
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,160
No.

358
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:54,160
I'm not.

359
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:32,720
-So, will you sue her for divorce?
-No, I'd lose my job.

360
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:35,320
Well, you'll keep your job.
I'll make sure of that.

361
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,800
It would make me a divorcee.

362
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,400
But not the guilty party.

363
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:52,520
Still, I'd be soiled goods.
I'd be tainted with scandal.

364
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,520
You'd also be free.

365
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,400
To remarry.

366
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:06,800
One day.

367
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:10,600
Yes.

368
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:18,920
Down there, please.

369
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,960
Christ. Hide. There, there. There. Go.

370
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:32,880
-Is it this one?
-Yeah, I think so.

371
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,280
-No, no, it's not. It's this one.
-Right.

372
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:37,640
Come in.

373
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:40,440
Sorry to barge in.
Have you got a second?

374
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:41,560
-Of course, sir.
-May I?

375
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:42,520
Please.

376
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,720
That's what I want to talk to you about.

377
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:50,560
-Flying.
-Yes, sir.

378
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:52,800
You're an experienced air jockey
and I've an idea.

379
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:55,560
And, look,
please disavow me of it if I'm wrong

380
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:59,800
but, to be up there in a plane,
it's the biggest thrill of them all.

381
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:03,880
-It is, sir.
-I mean, really. The biggest.

382
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,080
It is, sir.

383
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:13,240
Once you break through the clouds to
the clear blue beyond, the space, the...

384
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:18,800
the silence, the transcendent beauty,

385
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:22,880
it's church for the irreligious man.

386
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:25,960
That's what I'd hoped you'd say.
Where could I learn?

387
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:28,880
Uh... White Waltham Airfield,
they've a good school there.

388
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,400
-Would you take me?
-Of course, sir.

389
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,800
Good man.

390
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:37,920
You know, my sister,
my favourite sister actually,

391
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,160
Cecile, died in a plane.

392
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:44,200
It went down over Ostend in a storm.

393
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,960
Eight months pregnant.

394
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:50,840
She went into labour mid-flight
and they found the child,

395
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,880
next to her in the wreckage.

396
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,760
A boy.

397
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:02,960
Mm.

398
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,960
Mm.

399
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:22,040
New part of the uniform, Peter?

400
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,000
Anyone we know?

401
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:33,360
I... no.

402
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:37,080
No, quite right. None of my business.

403
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:39,520
Thank you, sir.

404
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:56,880
You're enjoying this, aren't you?

405
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,160
Yes.

406
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,600
Mr. Colville, Your Majesty.

407
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:13,080
Your Majesties. Tommy.

408
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:16,280
Come in, Jock. Take a seat.

409
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:20,880
We have a significant concern
which we'd like to convey

410
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,800
to the Prime Minister.

411
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:26,520
It concerns the Duke of Edinburgh.

412
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:41,360
<i> Ma'am, word has reached me</i>
<i>that it is your desire</i>

413
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:46,440
<i>that you and your children should keep</i>
<i>your husband's name, Mountbatten.</i>

414
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:48,920
It is.

415
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,720
Ma'am, you must not.
It would be a grave mistake.

416
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,840
Mountbatten was the adoptive name

417
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:58,600
your husband took
when he became a British citizen.

418
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:03,280
His real name...
you'll not need reminding,

419
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:07,240
was
Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderberg-Glucksberg

420
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:11,720
of the Royal houses of Denmark and Norway
and, latterly, of Greece!

421
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,920
I am an old man.

422
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:26,720
Many have questioned my relevance,
whether I still have something to offer.

423
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:30,320
In public life, the answer is, I have.

424
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:34,520
Which is to leave in place
a Sovereign prepared for office.

425
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:37,960
Equipped, armed for her duty.

426
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:46,360
Great things have happened to this country
under the sceptres of her queens

427
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:49,520
and you should be no exception.

428
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:53,760
Yes, I am Queen, but I am also a woman.

429
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:57,440
And a wife.

430
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:04,120
To a man whose pride and whose strength
were, in part, what attracted me to him.

431
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,440
I want to be in a successful marriage.

432
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:13,440
I would argue, stability under this roof
might even be in the national interest.

433
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,160
Had you considered that?

434
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:21,240
Very well. I will discuss it with Cabinet.

435
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:26,080
No.

436
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:33,000
You will inform the Cabinet,
Prime Minister.

437
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:38,440
That is the favour you will do me,

438
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,960
in return for one I'm already doing you.

439
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:54,200
I know your party wants you to resign
to make way for a younger man.

440
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,400
Mr. Eden.

441
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:02,720
I also know that no one
will bring up your resignation

442
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,640
while you are actively engaged
in planning the Coronation.

443
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:13,320
So, by delaying my investiture,
you are, in fact, holding onto power...

444
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:20,520
in which case, I would suggest
you are, somewhat, in my debt.

445
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:25,680
So, if... I agree to the delay,

446
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:32,200
perhaps you will consider supporting me
in the matter regarding my husband's name.

447
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:40,520
And perhaps you could also inform Cabinet

448
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:44,640
that my husband and I
intend to stay here at Clarence House.

449
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:47,320
-Why?
-It is our home.

450
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:51,200
It has just been refurbished
at great expense.

451
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:55,000
Buckingham Palace can still be
where official business is done

452
00:40:55,080 --> 00:41:01,840
but our home, our private family home,
will be Clarence House.

453
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:08,720
Very well.

454
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:32,160
<i>He was a little surprised, I think.</i>

455
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,840
- <i> Really?</i>
<i>- I dare express any view at all.</i>

456
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:37,000
Papa was always putty in his hands.

457
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:39,160
But I think one should start
as one means to continue.

458
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:43,160
-Absolutely. Put a marker down.
-Quite. Draw a line in the sand.

459
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:46,720
He said he'd put it to Cabinet
and I said there was nothing to discuss.

460
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:49,400
-Good for you.
-No, good for you.

461
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:51,760
-That's why I did it.
-Thank you.

462
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:17,240
Your Royal Highness, thank you for coming.

463
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:20,760
Not at all, dear Winston. How can I help?

464
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:27,440
I took it to Cabinet and, as expected,
the answer was unanimous,

465
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:29,640
"No" to both matters.

466
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:32,520
Well, she won't like it,
neither the snub over the name

467
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:34,720
nor the move to Buckingham Palace.

468
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:39,200
It really is a most dreadful place,
cold, uninviting,

469
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:44,040
but it's the right thing, for the young
family and the children to live there.

470
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:47,960
It's the focal point,
it's the monarch's home.

471
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:54,640
-Do you want me to break it to her?
-That would be very kind.

472
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,400
It's the least I can do.

473
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:59,640
I've never forgotten the way
in which you defended me,

474
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:04,000
fought for me during that terrible time.

475
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:07,640
I still think no man
should be punished for love.

476
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:10,800
And I also believe I spoke for many
in the country when I defended you.

477
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:12,840
You're very kind.

478
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:21,600
If I were to help you
in this matter with her,

479
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:24,920
perhaps I could ask a favour in return?

480
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:28,240
Name it.

481
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:48,080
Put in a word with the young Queen
for my allowance to be reinstated.

482
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:50,560
She holds the purse strings now.

483
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:54,320
The family expect me
to turn down commercial opportunities,

484
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:57,560
yet cuts off my allowance
at the same time.

485
00:43:57,640 --> 00:43:59,800
Ten thousand pounds,

486
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:03,360
it's quite impossible
to make ends meet without it.

487
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:06,680
That a former King
should come to me begging...

488
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:10,480
Consider it done.

489
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:19,200
There is also a brief moment
before the Coronation

490
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:24,640
where you might also
mobilize Cabinet support

491
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:31,520
for the one other thing that has eluded me
and gnaws away at my heart.

492
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:33,480
What?

493
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:36,120
The appropriate title
for the woman I married.

494
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:38,640
-No, sir.
-Her Royal Highness.

495
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:41,640
She is, after all,
the wife of a former King.

496
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:47,440
She's also a woman who has three husbands
that still live and breathe.

497
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:50,920
It is her right, Winston.

498
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:55,440
I'm determined she shall have it.
I'm determined she is shown respect.

499
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:59,200
Will you fight for it?

500
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:00,560
One more time?

501
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:05,680
I have defended you so many times.
Each time to my cost and in vain.

502
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:10,480
This love for her
has destroyed everything.

503
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:14,120
It is love, Winston.

504
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:16,680
Love.

505
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:20,880
The greatest thing on Earth.

506
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:19,280
His Royal Highness
the Duke of Windsor, Your Majesty.

507
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:25,720
Your Majesty.

508
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:29,520
Thank you for seeing me.

509
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:32,080
Thank you for coming.

510
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:46,240
Well, most of the time we're in Paris.
We've been given a house there.

511
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:50,640
Wallis likes to entertain.
She's so good at it.

512
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:55,480
So the place is always full.
And we have dogs.

513
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:57,480
Oh, really? What kind?

514
00:48:57,560 --> 00:49:04,520
Pugs. Davy Crockett, Trooper and Disraeli.

515
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:09,280
-Why pugs? What's the attraction?
-Well, they're... childlike.

516
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:13,720
-Need a lot of loving.
-They have a strange bark.

517
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:17,480
-Yes.
-More of a yap.

518
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:20,080
And they're lazy. Spend all day sleeping.

519
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:22,760
-Yes.
-They're awfully gassy.

520
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:25,000
Yes.

521
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:27,840
I suppose one can always open the windows.

522
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:34,560
-Don't you miss it?
-What?

523
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:37,000
The country of your birth.
The people here.

524
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:39,560
Your own flesh and blood.

525
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:44,320
Well, I would've done
if they'd accepted the woman I love.

526
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:48,400
But they didn't, so I don't.

527
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:51,280
So the former King keeps himself
at a distance.

528
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:55,880
A distance that was imposed upon me.
They wanted me out.

529
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:58,440
And reduces us all to cruel nicknames.

530
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:01,760
Shirley Temple.

531
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:06,120
Uh... Yes.

532
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:08,880
On account of the curls?

533
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:13,760
And precociousness.

534
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:16,760
-And stardom.
-You flatterer.

535
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:17,880
Not at all.

536
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:22,400
Generally,
we're better at queens than kings.

537
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:25,600
In this country I have a feeling
you'll be no exception.

538
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:30,040
-I certainly intend to do it well.
-I did, too.

539
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:32,600
Obviously, not hard enough.

540
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:35,920
No.

541
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:41,320
You never apologized.

542
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:43,760
To your papa, I most certainly did.

543
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:46,720
Your mother too.
I can show you the letters.

544
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:50,680
I didn't mean to them. I meant to me.

545
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:53,480
You?

546
00:50:57,080 --> 00:50:58,960
You don't think I'm deserving of one.

547
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:04,960
You don't think I would have preferred
to grow up out of the spotlight?

548
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:06,920
Away from Court?

549
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:11,600
Away from the scrutiny and the visibility.

550
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:14,840
A simpler life.

551
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,160
Happier life.

552
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:19,800
As a wife, a mother.

553
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:24,920
An ordinary English countrywoman.

554
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:29,120
I'm sorry.

555
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:35,360
Thank you.

556
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:45,880
You might extend the same apology
to my husband the next time you see him.

557
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:49,560
-Oh, is he struggling?
-A little.

558
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:52,160
Well, it'd be odd if he weren't.

559
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:57,480
Anyway, if I am to succeed,

560
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:01,520
then he and I are going to need
all the help we can get.

561
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:05,920
Well, I'm sure you're surrounded
by good people offering it.

562
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,640
Not if they're always off
in Paris or New York,

563
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:10,840
or wherever it is you spend your time.

564
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:14,880
Y-You would take my advice?

565
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:16,960
I would.

566
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:21,400
Particularly now my father
isn't here to give his.

567
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:26,600
I'd know it came from the heart.

568
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:30,560
Since I know, deep down,
despite everything,

569
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:32,480
that you care very deeply.

570
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:35,400
I do.

571
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:47,560
As it happens, there are two issues

572
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:51,280
on which I would like to offer
some advice.

573
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:56,440
The first is your husband's surname
and the name of the Royal house.

574
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:01,040
And the second?

575
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:24,600
There you are. There's something
I'd like to discuss with you.

576
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:26,360
Now, please don't react.

577
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:29,520
I'd like to take flying lessons.

578
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:32,480
I know.

579
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:35,880
But, trust me, becoming a pilot
has been a lifelong ambition of mine

580
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:40,760
and I think I've found a teacher
mad enough to take me on as a pupil.

581
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:43,360
Peter, no less, Peter Townsend.

582
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:50,680
-What's the matter?
-I need to talk to you.

583
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:51,760
About what?

584
00:53:55,240 --> 00:53:57,080
They'd rather we didn't keep the name.

585
00:53:58,320 --> 00:53:59,880
Mountbatten.

586
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:03,000
Who's "they?"

587
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:05,400
-Cabinet.
-It's none of their business.

588
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:08,160
I think you'll find
it's very much their business.

589
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:10,920
You're my wife,
taking my name is the law.

590
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,960
It's the custom. Not the law.

591
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:15,840
A custom practiced so universally
it might as well be the law.

592
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:18,120
You can't do this.
Am I to be the only man in the country

593
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:20,000
whose wife and children
don't take his name?

594
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:22,680
You can't do this to Dickie.
It will devastate him.

595
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:25,600
You know that.
You know how important it is to him.

596
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:28,800
I've told him the Royal house Mountbatten
is in the bag.

597
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:32,320
Well, that was a mistake. It's not.

598
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:36,240
The name has to be Windsor. For stability.

599
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:38,400
There's more.

600
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:44,040
-Clarence House...
-Our home. What about it?

601
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:47,400
We have to give it up.

602
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:50,680
The home of the Sovereign
of the United Kingdom

603
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:51,840
is Buckingham Palace.

604
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:53,040
Says who?

605
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:56,720
Me.

606
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:00,600
I thought you hated that place.

607
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:04,000
I do. We all do.

608
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:07,880
Then why go along with it?

609
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:11,520
Because that's the overwhelming advice.

610
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:13,640
But that's the point, Elizabeth,
it's just advice.

611
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:15,760
It doesn't mean
that you have to act on it.

612
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:18,440
When it comes from the government,
you do.

613
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:32,960
What kind of marriage is this?

614
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:36,000
What kind of family?

615
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:39,840
You've taken my career from me,
you've taken my home.

616
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:42,840
You've taken my name.

617
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:51,800
I thought we were in this together.

618
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:28,360
See? Daddy's here.

619
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:30,120
Welcome home, ma'am.

620
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:58,600
<i> My Lords...</i>

621
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:03,520
I hereby declare my will and pleasure

622
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:08,760
that I and my children
shall be styled and known

623
00:57:08,840 --> 00:57:11,960
as the House and Family of Windsor.

624
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,360
And that my descendants,

625
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:20,240
other than female descendants
who marry, and their descendants,

626
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:23,720
shall bear the name of Windsor.
