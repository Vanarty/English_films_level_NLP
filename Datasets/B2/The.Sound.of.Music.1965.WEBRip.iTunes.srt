1
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:46,959
The hills are alive

2
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,255
With the sound of music

3
00:02:51,755 --> 00:02:54,216
With songs they have sung

4
00:02:54,258 --> 00:02:58,929
For a thousand years

5
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:02,766
The hills fill my heart

6
00:03:02,808 --> 00:03:07,229
With the sound of music

7
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:14,444
My heart wants to sing
Every song it hears

8
00:03:15,404 --> 00:03:20,450
My heart wants to beat like the wings
Of the birds that rise

9
00:03:20,492 --> 00:03:23,453
From the lake to the trees

10
00:03:23,954 --> 00:03:28,292
My heart wants to sigh
Like a chime that flies

11
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:32,171
From a church on a breeze

12
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:36,258
To laugh like a brook
When it trips and falls

13
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:39,636
Over stones on its way

14
00:03:40,137 --> 00:03:43,932
To sing through the night

15
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:48,187
Like a lark who is learning to pray

16
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:53,609
I go to the hills

17
00:03:54,276 --> 00:04:00,115
When my heart is lonely

18
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:03,744
I know I will hear

19
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:09,082
What I've heard before

20
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:13,504
My heart will be blessed

21
00:04:14,463 --> 00:04:21,386
With the sound of music

22
00:04:23,347 --> 00:04:28,352
And I'll sing

23
00:04:28,644 --> 00:04:35,484
Once more

24
00:09:19,601 --> 00:09:24,314
Hallelujah, hallelujah

25
00:09:24,565 --> 00:09:29,486
Hallelujah, hallelujah

26
00:09:31,864 --> 00:09:34,074
-Reverend Mother.
-Sister Bernice.

27
00:09:34,116 --> 00:09:36,910
-I simply cannot find her.
-Maria?

28
00:09:37,953 --> 00:09:39,955
She's missing again.

29
00:09:39,997 --> 00:09:42,624
We should've put a cowbell
around her neck.

30
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:45,961
Have you tried the barn? You know
how much she adores the animals.

31
00:09:46,003 --> 00:09:48,922
I have looked everywhere.
In all of the usual places.

32
00:09:48,964 --> 00:09:51,425
Sister, considering it's Maria,

33
00:09:51,466 --> 00:09:54,428
I suggest you look in
someplace unusual.

34
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:00,809
Well, Reverend Mother,

35
00:10:00,851 --> 00:10:03,729
I hope this new infraction ends
whatever doubts

36
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:07,149
you may still have
about Maria's future here.

37
00:10:07,191 --> 00:10:11,278
I always try to keep faith
in my doubts, Sister Berthe.

38
00:10:11,528 --> 00:10:14,615
After all, the wool of a black sheep
is just as warm.

39
00:10:14,656 --> 00:10:18,952
We are not talking about sheep,
black or white, Sister Margaretta.

40
00:10:19,203 --> 00:10:22,956
Of all the candidates for
the novitiate, Maria is the least...

41
00:10:22,998 --> 00:10:24,750
Children, children.

42
00:10:25,876 --> 00:10:29,838
We were speculating about
the qualifications of our postulants.

43
00:10:30,464 --> 00:10:33,467
The Mistress of Novices
and the Mistress of Postulants

44
00:10:33,717 --> 00:10:38,597
were trying to help me
by expressing opposite points of view.

45
00:10:39,223 --> 00:10:42,684
Tell me, Sister Catherine,
what do you think of Maria?

46
00:10:42,726 --> 00:10:45,395
She's a wonderful girl,
some of the time.

47
00:10:46,688 --> 00:10:49,858
-Sister Agatha?
-It's very easy to like Maria,

48
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:52,152
except when it's difficult.

49
00:10:52,694 --> 00:10:56,365
-And you, Sister Sophia?
-Oh, I love her very dearly.

50
00:10:56,406 --> 00:10:59,618
But she always seems to be
in trouble, doesn't she?

51
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:01,703
Exactly what I say.

52
00:11:01,745 --> 00:11:04,289
She climbs a tree and scrapes her knee

53
00:11:04,331 --> 00:11:06,750
Her dress has got a tear

54
00:11:06,792 --> 00:11:11,547
She waltzes on her way to Mass
And whistles on the stair

55
00:11:11,588 --> 00:11:16,301
And underneath her wimple
She has curlers in her hair

56
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:20,931
I've even heard her singing
In the abbey

57
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:23,225
She's always late for chapel

58
00:11:23,267 --> 00:11:25,894
But her penitence is real

59
00:11:25,936 --> 00:11:28,272
She's always late for everything

60
00:11:28,522 --> 00:11:30,566
Except for every meal

61
00:11:30,816 --> 00:11:35,571
I hate to have to say it
But I very firmly feel

62
00:11:35,946 --> 00:11:40,826
Maria's not an asset to the abbey

63
00:11:40,868 --> 00:11:43,537
I'd like to say a word in her behalf

64
00:11:43,579 --> 00:11:45,747
Say it, Sister Margaretta.

65
00:11:45,789 --> 00:11:49,209
Maria makes me laugh

66
00:11:52,713 --> 00:11:55,924
How do you solve a problem like Maria?

67
00:11:56,884 --> 00:12:00,387
How do you catch a cloud
And pin it down?

68
00:12:00,888 --> 00:12:04,266
How do you find a word
That means Maria?

69
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:05,767
A flibbertigibbet

70
00:12:05,809 --> 00:12:07,936
-A will-o'-the-wisp
-A clown

71
00:12:09,146 --> 00:12:12,482
Many a thing you know
You'd like to tell her

72
00:12:13,025 --> 00:12:16,653
Many a thing she ought to understand

73
00:12:16,987 --> 00:12:21,283
But how do you make her stay
And listen to all you say?

74
00:12:21,325 --> 00:12:24,745
How do you keep a wave
Upon the sand?

75
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:29,541
How do you solve a problem like Maria?

76
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:34,796
How do you hold a moonbeam

77
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:40,802
In your hand?

78
00:12:41,929 --> 00:12:45,599
When I'm with her I'm confused
Out of focus and bemused

79
00:12:45,641 --> 00:12:49,269
And I never know exactly where I am

80
00:12:49,311 --> 00:12:52,814
-Unpredictable as weather
-She's as flighty as a feather

81
00:12:52,856 --> 00:12:54,858
-She's a darling
-She's a demon

82
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,485
She's a lamb

83
00:12:56,777 --> 00:13:00,614
She'll out pester any pest
Drive a hornet from its nest

84
00:13:00,656 --> 00:13:03,951
She can throw a whirling dervish
Out of whirl

85
00:13:04,535 --> 00:13:08,497
-She is gentle, she is wild
-She's a riddle, she's a child

86
00:13:08,539 --> 00:13:11,333
-She's a headache
-She's an angel

87
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:15,295
She's a girl

88
00:13:16,171 --> 00:13:19,800
How do you solve a problem like Maria?

89
00:13:20,175 --> 00:13:23,846
How do you catch a cloud
And pin it down?

90
00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:27,724
How do you find a word
That means Maria?

91
00:13:27,975 --> 00:13:30,143
-A flibbertigibbet
-A will-o'-the-wisp

92
00:13:30,185 --> 00:13:31,854
A clown

93
00:13:32,229 --> 00:13:35,899
Many a thing you know
You'd like to tell her

94
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:39,736
Many a thing she ought to understand

95
00:13:40,195 --> 00:13:44,533
-But how do you make her stay?
-And listen to all you say?

96
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:48,412
How do you keep a wave
Upon the sand?

97
00:13:48,912 --> 00:13:54,251
How do you solve a problem like Maria?

98
00:14:10,684 --> 00:14:17,149
How do you hold a moonbeam

99
00:14:18,442 --> 00:14:24,781
in your hand?

100
00:14:36,585 --> 00:14:38,587
You may go in now, Maria.

101
00:14:51,141 --> 00:14:52,976
Come here, my child.

102
00:14:59,316 --> 00:15:00,817
Now sit down.

103
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:05,405
Reverend Mother, I'm sorry.
I couldn't help myself.

104
00:15:05,447 --> 00:15:08,492
-The hills were beckoning and before...
-Dear.

105
00:15:08,909 --> 00:15:10,869
I haven't summoned you for apologies.

106
00:15:10,911 --> 00:15:13,413
Please let me ask for forgiveness.

107
00:15:13,997 --> 00:15:16,041
If you'll feel better.

108
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:18,710
Yes, you see,
the sky was so blue today

109
00:15:18,752 --> 00:15:22,714
and everything was so green and
fragrant, I had to be a part of it.

110
00:15:22,756 --> 00:15:27,427
The Untersberg led me higher like
it wanted me to go through the clouds.

111
00:15:27,469 --> 00:15:29,930
Suppose darkness had come
and you were lost?

112
00:15:29,972 --> 00:15:32,224
Mother, I could never be lost
up there.

113
00:15:32,266 --> 00:15:35,310
That's my mountain.
I was brought up on it.

114
00:15:35,352 --> 00:15:37,855
It was the mountain that
led me to you.

115
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,567
When I was a child,
I would come down and climb a tree

116
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:43,569
and look in your garden.

117
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:46,864
I'd see the sisters at work
and hear them sing.

118
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:51,827
Which brings me to another
transgression, Reverend Mother.

119
00:15:51,869 --> 00:15:54,162
I was singing out there today.

120
00:15:54,705 --> 00:15:58,625
Only in the abbey do we have rules
about postulants singing.

121
00:15:58,667 --> 00:16:01,170
I can't stop wherever I am.

122
00:16:01,211 --> 00:16:03,714
Worse, I can't seem to stop
saying things.

123
00:16:03,755 --> 00:16:06,175
Everything I think and feel.

124
00:16:06,216 --> 00:16:07,759
Some call that "honesty."

125
00:16:07,801 --> 00:16:10,179
Oh, but it's terrible,
Reverend Mother!

126
00:16:10,554 --> 00:16:14,725
You know how Sister Berthe makes me
kiss the floor after a disagreement?

127
00:16:14,766 --> 00:16:18,729
Lately, I kiss the floor
when I see her coming to save time.

128
00:16:20,898 --> 00:16:22,065
Maria,

129
00:16:23,025 --> 00:16:26,361
when you saw us over the wall
and longed to be with us,

130
00:16:26,403 --> 00:16:31,116
that didn't mean you were prepared
for the way we live here, did it?

131
00:16:32,409 --> 00:16:34,870
No, Mother, but I pray and I try.

132
00:16:34,912 --> 00:16:37,039
And I am learning. I really am.

133
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:40,209
What is the most important lesson
you have learned here?

134
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:44,046
To find out what is the will of God
and do it wholeheartedly.

135
00:16:46,882 --> 00:16:48,008
Maria,

136
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:52,638
it seems to be God's will
that you leave us.

137
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:54,681
-Leave?
-Only for a while.

138
00:16:54,723 --> 00:16:57,267
No, Mother!
Please don't send me away!

139
00:16:57,309 --> 00:17:01,605
This is where I belong. It's my home,
my family. It's my life.

140
00:17:02,189 --> 00:17:05,150
-Are you truly ready for it?
-Yes, I am.

141
00:17:05,192 --> 00:17:10,113
If you go out into the world for a time,
knowing what we expect of you,

142
00:17:10,614 --> 00:17:13,367
you will find out
if you can expect it of yourself.

143
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:16,703
I know what you expect, Mother,
and I can do it! I promise I can!

144
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:17,871
Maria.

145
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:22,459
Yes, Mother.

146
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:26,380
If it is God's will.

147
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:33,470
There is a family near Salzburg that
needs a governess until September.

148
00:17:33,846 --> 00:17:36,265
-September?
-For seven children.

149
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:38,100
Seven children?

150
00:17:38,141 --> 00:17:40,018
Do you like children?

151
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:41,854
Well, yes, but seven!

152
00:17:43,105 --> 00:17:46,483
I will tell Captain von Trapp
to expect you tomorrow.

153
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:48,694
Captain?

154
00:17:49,278 --> 00:17:53,949
A retired officer of the Imperial Navy.
A fine man and a brave one.

155
00:17:53,991 --> 00:17:56,743
His wife died,
and he is alone with the children.

156
00:17:56,785 --> 00:18:01,081
I understand he has had a difficult time
keeping a governess there.

157
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:05,127
Why difficult, Reverend Mother?

158
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:08,839
The Lord will show you
in his own good time.

159
00:18:45,417 --> 00:18:48,128
When the Lord closes a door,

160
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:50,672
somewhere he opens a window.

161
00:18:52,883 --> 00:18:56,678
What will this day be like?

162
00:18:58,096 --> 00:18:59,932
I wonder

163
00:19:06,897 --> 00:19:10,817
What will my future be?

164
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:13,946
I wonder

165
00:19:15,739 --> 00:19:18,825
It could be so exciting

166
00:19:18,867 --> 00:19:22,162
To be out in the world
To be free

167
00:19:22,204 --> 00:19:25,624
My heart should be wildly rejoicing

168
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:31,713
Oh, what's the matter with me?

169
00:19:32,005 --> 00:19:35,467
I've always longed for adventure

170
00:19:35,509 --> 00:19:39,263
To do the things I've never dared

171
00:19:39,304 --> 00:19:42,432
Now here I'm facing adventure

172
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:48,897
Then why am I so scared?

173
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:54,611
A captain with seven children

174
00:19:55,571 --> 00:19:57,865
What's so fearsome about that?

175
00:20:00,534 --> 00:20:03,579
I must stop these doubts
All these worries

176
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:06,748
If I don't, I just know I'll turn back

177
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:10,335
I must dream of the things
I am seeking

178
00:20:11,253 --> 00:20:15,799
I am seeking the courage I lack

179
00:20:16,967 --> 00:20:20,220
The courage to serve them
With reliance

180
00:20:21,054 --> 00:20:23,849
Face my mistakes without defiance

181
00:20:24,308 --> 00:20:26,101
Show them I'm worthy

182
00:20:26,143 --> 00:20:29,062
And while I show them

183
00:20:29,104 --> 00:20:33,317
I'll show me

184
00:20:33,358 --> 00:20:38,780
So let them bring on
All their problems

185
00:20:38,822 --> 00:20:41,825
I'll do better than my best

186
00:20:42,326 --> 00:20:45,662
I have confidence
They'll put me to the test

187
00:20:45,704 --> 00:20:49,291
But I'll make them see
I have confidence in me

188
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:52,794
Somehow, I will impress them

189
00:20:52,836 --> 00:20:56,381
I will be firm but kind

190
00:20:56,423 --> 00:20:59,968
And all those children
Heaven bless them

191
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:03,305
They will look up to me
And mind me

192
00:21:03,347 --> 00:21:06,808
With each step, I am more certain

193
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:10,270
Everything will turn out fine

194
00:21:10,312 --> 00:21:13,524
I have confidence
The world can all be mine

195
00:21:13,565 --> 00:21:18,820
They'll have to agree
I have confidence in me

196
00:21:20,531 --> 00:21:23,659
I have confidence in sunshine

197
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:26,870
I have confidence in rain

198
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:29,998
I have confidence
That spring will come again

199
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:33,502
Besides which you see
I have confidence in me

200
00:21:33,544 --> 00:21:36,755
Strength doesn't lie in numbers

201
00:21:36,797 --> 00:21:40,008
Strength doesn't lie in wealth

202
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:43,595
Strength lies in nights
Of peaceful slumbers

203
00:21:43,637 --> 00:21:46,765
When you wake up, wake up
It's healthy

204
00:21:46,807 --> 00:21:49,810
All I trust I leave my heart to

205
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:52,813
All I trust becomes my own

206
00:21:53,188 --> 00:21:57,401
I have confidence in confidence alone

207
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:14,251
Oh, help.

208
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:32,603
I have confidence in confidence alone

209
00:22:33,687 --> 00:22:38,525
Besides which you see
I have confidence

210
00:22:38,942 --> 00:22:45,782
in me

211
00:22:52,164 --> 00:22:54,583
Hello. Here I am.

212
00:22:57,419 --> 00:23:00,214
I'm from the convent.
I'm the new governess, Captain.

213
00:23:01,006 --> 00:23:03,884
And I'm the old butler, Fräulein.

214
00:23:06,136 --> 00:23:07,971
Well, how do you do?

215
00:23:18,565 --> 00:23:21,902
You'll wait here, please.

216
00:24:48,906 --> 00:24:53,535
In the future, remember certain rooms
in this house are not to be disturbed.

217
00:24:54,119 --> 00:24:55,829
Yes, Captain, sir.

218
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:08,592
-Why do you stare at me that way?
-You don't look like a sea captain.

219
00:25:10,093 --> 00:25:13,305
I'm afraid you don't look
very much like a governess.

220
00:25:13,764 --> 00:25:15,307
-Turn around.
-What?

221
00:25:15,349 --> 00:25:16,683
Turn.

222
00:25:19,603 --> 00:25:20,938
Hat off.

223
00:25:23,941 --> 00:25:26,777
Put on another dress
before meeting the children.

224
00:25:26,818 --> 00:25:28,737
But I don't have another.

225
00:25:28,779 --> 00:25:31,740
When we enter the abbey,
our worldly clothes go to the poor.

226
00:25:31,782 --> 00:25:33,283
What about this one?

227
00:25:33,325 --> 00:25:35,285
The poor didn't want it.

228
00:25:36,537 --> 00:25:40,457
There wasn't time to make a new dress.
I can make clothes.

229
00:25:41,625 --> 00:25:44,127
I'll see that you get some material.

230
00:25:44,169 --> 00:25:45,963
Today, if possible.

231
00:25:46,797 --> 00:25:48,882
-Now, Fräulein...
-Maria.

232
00:25:48,924 --> 00:25:51,134
I don't know how much
the abbess told you.

233
00:25:51,176 --> 00:25:54,471
-Not much.
-You are the twelfth governess

234
00:25:54,513 --> 00:25:57,182
to look after my children
since their mother died.

235
00:25:57,224 --> 00:25:59,768
I trust you will be an improvement
on the last one.

236
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:01,812
She stayed only two hours.

237
00:26:03,313 --> 00:26:05,941
What's wrong with the children, sir?

238
00:26:07,317 --> 00:26:11,029
Nothing is wrong with the children,
only the governesses.

239
00:26:11,947 --> 00:26:16,827
They could not maintain discipline,
without which the house cannot be run.

240
00:26:17,911 --> 00:26:19,663
Drill them in their studies.

241
00:26:19,705 --> 00:26:23,417
I will not permit them to dream
away their summer holidays.

242
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:26,461
Each afternoon,
they march, breathing deeply.

243
00:26:26,503 --> 00:26:28,463
Bedtime is to be strictly observed.

244
00:26:28,505 --> 00:26:29,631
When do they play?

245
00:26:29,673 --> 00:26:33,886
You will see to it that they conduct
themselves with the utmost decorum.

246
00:26:33,927 --> 00:26:36,763
-I am placing you in command.
-Yes, sir.

247
00:27:57,594 --> 00:27:58,762
Now,

248
00:27:59,346 --> 00:28:02,266
this is your new governess,
Fräulein Maria.

249
00:28:03,934 --> 00:28:06,144
Give your name at your signal.

250
00:28:06,186 --> 00:28:10,107
Fräulein, listen carefully. Learn
their signals so you can call them.

251
00:28:11,650 --> 00:28:12,901
Liesl.

252
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,778
Friedrich.

253
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:16,572
Louisa.

254
00:28:17,114 --> 00:28:18,282
Kurt.

255
00:28:18,657 --> 00:28:19,867
Brigitta.

256
00:28:19,908 --> 00:28:21,118
Marta.

257
00:28:27,583 --> 00:28:28,792
Gretl.

258
00:28:33,547 --> 00:28:36,425
Now, let's see how well you listened.

259
00:28:37,217 --> 00:28:39,803
I won't need to whistle for them,
Reverend Captain.

260
00:28:39,845 --> 00:28:43,432
I mean, I'll use their names.
Such lovely names.

261
00:28:43,473 --> 00:28:46,894
Fräulein, this is a large house.
The grounds are extensive.

262
00:28:46,935 --> 00:28:49,771
And I will not have anyone shouting.

263
00:28:49,813 --> 00:28:51,773
You will take this, please.
Learn to use it.

264
00:28:51,815 --> 00:28:53,817
The children will help you.

265
00:28:55,569 --> 00:28:59,198
Now, when I want you,
this is what you will hear.

266
00:29:00,365 --> 00:29:02,409
Oh, no, sir. I'm sorry, sir!

267
00:29:03,118 --> 00:29:04,786
I could never answer to a whistle.

268
00:29:04,828 --> 00:29:07,623
Whistles are for animals,
not for children.

269
00:29:07,664 --> 00:29:09,708
And definitely not for me.

270
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,211
It would be too humiliating.

271
00:29:13,587 --> 00:29:18,967
Fräulein, were you this much trouble
at the abbey?

272
00:29:19,009 --> 00:29:20,844
Oh, much more, sir.

273
00:29:31,313 --> 00:29:33,398
I don't know your signal.

274
00:29:34,274 --> 00:29:36,610
You may call me "Captain."

275
00:29:49,831 --> 00:29:51,291
At ease.

276
00:29:54,044 --> 00:29:55,838
Now that there's just us,

277
00:29:55,879 --> 00:30:00,050
would you please tell me all your
names again and how old you are.

278
00:30:00,551 --> 00:30:04,137
I'm Liesl. I'm 16 years old,
and I don't need a governess.

279
00:30:05,305 --> 00:30:08,725
I'm glad you told me, Liesl.
We'll just be good friends.

280
00:30:10,519 --> 00:30:13,772
I'm Friedrich. I'm 14.
I'm impossible.

281
00:30:14,565 --> 00:30:16,567
Really? Who told you that, Friedrich?

282
00:30:16,608 --> 00:30:19,570
Fräulein Josephine.
Four governesses ago.

283
00:30:20,487 --> 00:30:22,072
I'm Brigitta.

284
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:27,077
You didn't tell me
how old you are, Louisa.

285
00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:30,581
I'm Brigitta. She's Louisa.

286
00:30:30,998 --> 00:30:33,750
She's 13 years old, and you're smart.

287
00:30:34,001 --> 00:30:38,088
I'm 10, and I think your dress
is the ugliest one I ever saw.

288
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:40,841
-Brigitta, you shouldn't say that.
-Why not?

289
00:30:40,883 --> 00:30:43,468
-Don't you think it's ugly?
-Of course.

290
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:45,971
But Fräulein Helga's was ugliest.

291
00:30:46,597 --> 00:30:49,349
I'm Kurt. I'm 11.
I'm incorrigible.

292
00:30:49,391 --> 00:30:52,269
-Congratulations.
-What's "incorrigible"?

293
00:30:52,769 --> 00:30:56,106
I think it means you want
to be treated like a boy.

294
00:30:58,859 --> 00:31:02,279
I'm Marta, and I'm going to be
seven on Tuesday.

295
00:31:02,321 --> 00:31:04,323
I'd like a pink parasol.

296
00:31:04,907 --> 00:31:06,992
Pink's my favorite color, too.

297
00:31:08,702 --> 00:31:10,329
Yes, you're Gretl.

298
00:31:10,787 --> 00:31:12,539
And you're five years old?

299
00:31:12,956 --> 00:31:14,958
My, you're practically a lady.

300
00:31:17,544 --> 00:31:21,215
I have to tell you a secret.
I've never been a governess.

301
00:31:22,049 --> 00:31:25,052
You don't know anything
about being a governess?

302
00:31:25,093 --> 00:31:27,346
Nothing. I'll need lots of advice.

303
00:31:27,387 --> 00:31:32,100
The best way to start is to tell
Father to mind his own business.

304
00:31:32,142 --> 00:31:34,102
Never come to dinner on time.

305
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:36,480
Never eat your soup quietly.

306
00:31:37,147 --> 00:31:39,441
During dessert,
always blow your nose.

307
00:31:39,483 --> 00:31:42,444
Don't you believe a word they say,
Fräulein Maria.

308
00:31:42,486 --> 00:31:45,405
-Oh, why not?
-Because I like you.

309
00:31:46,657 --> 00:31:48,784
Children, outside for your walk.

310
00:31:48,825 --> 00:31:50,911
Father's orders. Hurry up.

311
00:31:50,953 --> 00:31:52,746
Quick, quick, quick.

312
00:31:52,788 --> 00:31:55,916
Fräulein Maria, I'm Frau Schmidt,
the housekeeper.

313
00:31:55,958 --> 00:31:57,125
How do you do.

314
00:31:57,167 --> 00:31:59,837
I'll show you to your room.
Follow me.

315
00:32:11,181 --> 00:32:12,933
Poor little dears.

316
00:32:25,654 --> 00:32:29,992
You're very lucky.
With Fräulein Helga it was a snake.

317
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:44,923
Good evening.

318
00:32:46,633 --> 00:32:50,220
-Good evening, children.
-Good evening, Fräulein Maria.

319
00:32:57,394 --> 00:32:59,188
Enchanting little ritual.

320
00:32:59,229 --> 00:33:02,149
Something you learned at the abbey?

321
00:33:02,941 --> 00:33:04,318
No.

322
00:33:07,154 --> 00:33:08,405
Rheumatism.

323
00:33:18,332 --> 00:33:22,252
Excuse me, Captain.
Haven't we forgotten to thank the Lord?

324
00:33:29,593 --> 00:33:33,055
For what we receive,
may the Lord make us truly thankful.

325
00:33:33,096 --> 00:33:35,057
-Amen.
-Amen.

326
00:33:39,603 --> 00:33:41,396
I'd like to thank you all

327
00:33:41,438 --> 00:33:44,441
for the precious gift
you left in my pocket today.

328
00:33:48,195 --> 00:33:49,571
What gift?

329
00:33:53,116 --> 00:33:55,911
It's a secret between
the children and me.

330
00:33:55,953 --> 00:33:58,956
Then I suggest you keep it,
and let us eat.

331
00:33:59,581 --> 00:34:01,750
Knowing how nervous
I must have been,

332
00:34:01,792 --> 00:34:04,378
a stranger in a new household,

333
00:34:04,419 --> 00:34:07,714
knowing how important it was
for me to feel accepted,

334
00:34:07,756 --> 00:34:11,717
it was so kind and thoughtful of
you to make my first moments here

335
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,971
so warm and happy

336
00:34:14,638 --> 00:34:16,139
and pleasant.

337
00:34:25,690 --> 00:34:28,277
-What is the matter, Marta?
-Nothing.

338
00:34:40,163 --> 00:34:45,168
Fräulein, is it to be at every meal
or merely at dinnertime

339
00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:49,797
that you intend leading us through
this rare and wonderful new world

340
00:34:50,132 --> 00:34:51,800
of indigestion?

341
00:34:53,802 --> 00:34:56,972
They're all right, Captain.
They're just happy.

342
00:35:15,032 --> 00:35:17,910
-Rolfe, good evening.
-Good evening, Franz.

343
00:35:17,951 --> 00:35:20,871
-I trust everything is under control?
-Yes, yes.

344
00:35:22,289 --> 00:35:24,875
-Are there any developments?
-Perhaps.

345
00:35:24,917 --> 00:35:27,377
-Is the Captain home?
-He's at dinner.

346
00:35:27,419 --> 00:35:29,755
-With the family?
-Yes.

347
00:35:30,088 --> 00:35:32,591
Give him this telegram at once.

348
00:35:32,633 --> 00:35:34,009
Certainly.

349
00:35:45,395 --> 00:35:47,397
A telegram for you, sir.

350
00:35:49,816 --> 00:35:52,152
Franz? Who delivered it?

351
00:35:52,194 --> 00:35:54,655
That young lad Rolfe, of course.

352
00:35:56,490 --> 00:35:58,617
Father, may I be excused?

353
00:35:59,117 --> 00:36:03,455
Children, in the morning
I shall be going to Vienna.

354
00:36:03,789 --> 00:36:06,542
Not again, Father!

355
00:36:10,212 --> 00:36:12,840
How long will you be gone this time?

356
00:36:12,881 --> 00:36:14,424
I'm not sure, Gretl.

357
00:36:14,466 --> 00:36:18,345
-To visit Baroness Schraeder again?
-Mind your own business!

358
00:36:19,012 --> 00:36:21,557
As a matter of fact, yes, Louisa.

359
00:36:22,349 --> 00:36:26,937
-Why can't we ever see the Baroness?
-Why would she want to see you?

360
00:36:26,979 --> 00:36:31,567
You are going to see the Baroness.
I'm bringing her back with me to visit.

361
00:36:33,193 --> 00:36:35,153
And Uncle Max.

362
00:36:35,195 --> 00:36:37,656
-Uncle Max!
-Uncle Max!

363
00:36:53,797 --> 00:36:55,090
Rolfe!

364
00:36:58,177 --> 00:36:59,553
Oh, Rolfe!

365
00:37:01,847 --> 00:37:04,975
-No, Liesl. We mustn't!
-Why not, silly?

366
00:37:05,017 --> 00:37:07,895
-I don't know...
-Isn't this why you're waiting?

367
00:37:07,936 --> 00:37:09,855
Yes, of course.

368
00:37:09,897 --> 00:37:12,900
-I've missed you, Liesl.
-You have? How much?

369
00:37:12,941 --> 00:37:17,112
I even thought of sending a telegram,
so I'd be able to deliver it here.

370
00:37:17,154 --> 00:37:21,241
Oh, that's a lovely thought!
Why don't you, right now?

371
00:37:21,283 --> 00:37:25,704
-But I'm here!
-Please, Rolfe. Send me a telegram.

372
00:37:25,746 --> 00:37:29,208
I'll start it for you. "Dear Liesl..."

373
00:37:29,833 --> 00:37:32,836
"Dear Liesl, I'd like to be able to tell you

374
00:37:32,878 --> 00:37:35,088
"how I feel about you. Stop.

375
00:37:36,048 --> 00:37:40,802
"Unfortunately, this wire
is already too expensive.

376
00:37:40,844 --> 00:37:42,471
"Sincerely, Rolfe."

377
00:37:42,513 --> 00:37:45,390
-"Sincerely"?
-Cordially.

378
00:37:45,432 --> 00:37:48,101
-"Cordially"?
-Affectionately?

379
00:37:50,437 --> 00:37:52,481
Will there be any reply?

380
00:37:53,774 --> 00:37:55,943
"Dear Rolfe. Stop.

381
00:37:56,860 --> 00:38:00,030
"Don't stop! Your Liesl."

382
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:05,744
If only we didn't have to wait
for someone to send Father a telegram.

383
00:38:05,786 --> 00:38:08,539
How do I know when I'll see you again?

384
00:38:09,373 --> 00:38:11,083
Well, let's see...

385
00:38:13,502 --> 00:38:15,754
I could come here by mistake.

386
00:38:16,338 --> 00:38:21,009
With a telegram for Colonel Schneider!
He's here from Berlin staying with...

387
00:38:21,927 --> 00:38:25,222
No one knows he's here.
Don't tell your father.

388
00:38:25,472 --> 00:38:29,017
-Why not?
-Your father's so Austrian.

389
00:38:29,059 --> 00:38:30,352
We're all Austrian.

390
00:38:30,394 --> 00:38:34,940
Some think we ought to be German, and
they're very mad at those who don't.

391
00:38:34,982 --> 00:38:37,234
They're getting ready to...

392
00:38:38,485 --> 00:38:41,196
Let's hope your father
doesn't get into trouble.

393
00:38:41,238 --> 00:38:46,285
Don't worry. He's a big naval hero.
He was even decorated by the emperor.

394
00:38:46,326 --> 00:38:49,955
I don't worry about him.
I worry about his daughter.

395
00:38:49,997 --> 00:38:52,958
-Me? Why?
-Well, you're so...

396
00:38:53,959 --> 00:38:58,755
-You're such a baby!
-I'm 16. What's such a baby about that?

397
00:39:00,883 --> 00:39:04,678
You wait, little girl
On an empty stage

398
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:07,556
For fate to turn the light on

399
00:39:08,682 --> 00:39:12,186
Your life, little girl
Is an empty page

400
00:39:12,227 --> 00:39:16,106
That men will want to write on

401
00:39:17,024 --> 00:39:22,279
To write on

402
00:39:23,447 --> 00:39:27,492
You are 16 going on 17

403
00:39:27,534 --> 00:39:31,038
Baby, it's time to think

404
00:39:31,538 --> 00:39:35,459
Better beware
Be canny and careful

405
00:39:35,501 --> 00:39:38,962
Baby, you're on the brink

406
00:39:39,463 --> 00:39:43,467
You are 16 going on 17

407
00:39:43,509 --> 00:39:47,429
Fellows will fall in line

408
00:39:47,471 --> 00:39:50,974
Eager young lads
And roués and cads

409
00:39:51,016 --> 00:39:55,437
Will offer you food and wine

410
00:39:55,479 --> 00:39:59,274
Totally unprepared are you

411
00:39:59,316 --> 00:40:02,778
To face a world of men

412
00:40:03,487 --> 00:40:07,157
Timid and shy and scared are you

413
00:40:07,199 --> 00:40:11,328
Of things beyond your ken

414
00:40:11,703 --> 00:40:15,791
You need someone older and wiser

415
00:40:15,832 --> 00:40:19,837
Telling you what to do

416
00:40:19,878 --> 00:40:23,799
I am 17 going on 18

417
00:40:23,841 --> 00:40:29,847
I'll take care of you

418
00:41:02,004 --> 00:41:05,674
I am 16 going on 17

419
00:41:05,716 --> 00:41:09,344
I know that I'm naive

420
00:41:09,386 --> 00:41:12,639
Fellows I meet
May tell me I'm sweet

421
00:41:12,681 --> 00:41:16,185
And willingly I believe

422
00:41:16,810 --> 00:41:20,522
I am 16 going on 17

423
00:41:20,564 --> 00:41:24,151
Innocent as a rose

424
00:41:24,193 --> 00:41:27,905
Bachelor dandies
Drinkers of brandies

425
00:41:27,946 --> 00:41:31,575
What do I know of those?

426
00:41:31,617 --> 00:41:35,204
Totally unprepared am I

427
00:41:35,245 --> 00:41:38,373
To face a world of men

428
00:41:39,249 --> 00:41:42,794
Timid and shy and scared am I

429
00:41:42,836 --> 00:41:46,507
Of things beyond my ken

430
00:41:46,965 --> 00:41:50,802
I need someone older and wiser

431
00:41:50,844 --> 00:41:54,515
Telling me what to do

432
00:41:54,556 --> 00:41:58,268
You are 17 going on 18

433
00:41:58,310 --> 00:42:03,649
I'll depend on you

434
00:43:57,137 --> 00:43:58,514
Come in.

435
00:43:59,556 --> 00:44:01,225
Frau Schmidt.

436
00:44:03,519 --> 00:44:05,521
For your new dresses.

437
00:44:05,562 --> 00:44:09,775
-The Captain had these sent from town.
-Oh, how lovely!

438
00:44:09,816 --> 00:44:13,695
These will make the prettiest clothes
I've ever had.

439
00:44:13,737 --> 00:44:17,282
Do you think he would
get me more material if I asked?

440
00:44:17,324 --> 00:44:21,161
-How many dresses do you need?
-Not for me, for the children.

441
00:44:21,203 --> 00:44:23,455
I want to make them some play clothes.

442
00:44:23,497 --> 00:44:27,084
The von Trapp children don't play.
They march.

443
00:44:27,459 --> 00:44:29,920
Surely you don't approve of that.

444
00:44:31,004 --> 00:44:33,549
Ever since the Captain lost his poor wife,

445
00:44:33,590 --> 00:44:36,677
he runs this house as if on one of his ships.

446
00:44:37,094 --> 00:44:38,637
Whistles, orders.

447
00:44:38,679 --> 00:44:40,931
No more music, no more laughing.

448
00:44:40,973 --> 00:44:44,476
Nothing that reminds him of her.
Even the children.

449
00:44:44,977 --> 00:44:46,895
But that's so wrong.

450
00:44:46,937 --> 00:44:48,689
Oh, well.

451
00:44:48,730 --> 00:44:52,609
How do you like your room?
There'll be new drapes at the windows.

452
00:44:52,651 --> 00:44:54,069
But these are fine.

453
00:44:54,111 --> 00:44:56,029
New ones have been ordered.

454
00:44:56,071 --> 00:44:59,533
-But I really don't need them.
-Good night, now.

455
00:44:59,575 --> 00:45:03,787
Frau Schmidt, if I asked
the Captain about the material...

456
00:45:03,829 --> 00:45:08,500
-He's leaving in the morning.
-Of course. How long will he be gone?

457
00:45:08,917 --> 00:45:13,505
It depends. The last time he visited
the Baroness, he stayed for a month.

458
00:45:14,548 --> 00:45:19,136
I shouldn't be saying this to you.
I don't know you that well.

459
00:45:19,469 --> 00:45:22,514
But if you ask me,
the Captain's thinking seriously

460
00:45:22,556 --> 00:45:25,058
of marrying her before summer's over.

461
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:28,353
Wonderful! The children will
have a mother again.

462
00:45:29,646 --> 00:45:31,148
Yes.

463
00:45:31,190 --> 00:45:33,233
Well, good night.

464
00:45:33,275 --> 00:45:34,735
Good night.

465
00:45:53,086 --> 00:45:56,131
Dear Father, now I know
why you sent me here.

466
00:45:56,173 --> 00:45:59,134
To help these children
prepare for a new mother.

467
00:45:59,176 --> 00:46:02,763
And I pray this will become
a happy family in Thy sight.

468
00:46:02,804 --> 00:46:06,099
God bless the Captain.
God bless Liesl and Friedrich.

469
00:46:06,141 --> 00:46:10,479
God bless Louisa, Brigitta,
Marta and little Gretl.

470
00:46:10,521 --> 00:46:13,524
And I forgot the other boy.
What's his name?

471
00:46:15,108 --> 00:46:17,027
Well, God bless what's-his-name.

472
00:46:17,069 --> 00:46:21,406
God bless the Reverend Mother
and Sister Margaretta

473
00:46:21,448 --> 00:46:23,325
and everybody at the abbey.

474
00:46:23,367 --> 00:46:25,911
And now, dear God, about Liesl.

475
00:46:26,411 --> 00:46:28,497
Help her know that I'm her friend

476
00:46:28,539 --> 00:46:31,667
and help her tell me
what she's been up to.

477
00:46:31,708 --> 00:46:33,293
Are you going to tell on me?

478
00:46:33,335 --> 00:46:36,755
Help me to be understanding
so I may guide her footsteps.

479
00:46:36,797 --> 00:46:39,800
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Ghost.

480
00:46:39,842 --> 00:46:42,970
I was out walking
and somebody locked the doors early.

481
00:46:43,011 --> 00:46:47,140
I didn't want to wake everybody,
so when I saw your window open...

482
00:46:48,350 --> 00:46:51,436
You're not going to tell Father, are you?

483
00:46:57,526 --> 00:46:59,152
How did you climb up?

484
00:46:59,194 --> 00:47:02,531
It's how we always got in
to play tricks on the governess.

485
00:47:02,573 --> 00:47:06,535
Louisa can make it with
a whole jar of spiders in her hand.

486
00:47:06,577 --> 00:47:08,161
Spiders?

487
00:47:10,414 --> 00:47:14,751
Liesl, were you out walking all by yourself?

488
00:47:22,092 --> 00:47:26,138
If we wash that dress tonight,
nobody would notice it tomorrow.

489
00:47:26,471 --> 00:47:28,390
You could put this on.

490
00:47:29,933 --> 00:47:32,811
Take your dress
and put it to soak in the bathtub.

491
00:47:32,853 --> 00:47:36,523
Come back here and sit on the bed,
and we'll have a talk.

492
00:47:37,691 --> 00:47:40,944
I told you today I didn't need a governess.

493
00:47:40,986 --> 00:47:43,113
Well, maybe I do.

494
00:48:13,519 --> 00:48:16,063
Gretl, are you scared?

495
00:48:19,525 --> 00:48:22,069
You're not frightened of a storm, are you?

496
00:48:22,110 --> 00:48:24,613
You just stay right here with me.

497
00:48:25,572 --> 00:48:29,785
-Where are the others?
-They're asleep. They're not scared.

498
00:48:34,248 --> 00:48:36,083
Oh, no? Look.

499
00:48:37,668 --> 00:48:39,753
All right, up here on the bed.

500
00:48:39,795 --> 00:48:42,548
-Really?
-Well, just this once. Come on.

501
00:48:43,590 --> 00:48:47,970
-Now we'll wait for the boys.
-You won't see them. Boys are brave.

502
00:48:54,017 --> 00:48:56,311
You weren't scared, were you?

503
00:48:56,353 --> 00:48:59,690
Oh, no. We just wanted
to be sure that you weren't.

504
00:49:00,691 --> 00:49:04,111
-That's very thoughtful of you.
-It wasn't my idea.

505
00:49:04,152 --> 00:49:06,029
It was Kurt's!

506
00:49:06,071 --> 00:49:08,782
Kurt! That's the one I left out!
God bless Kurt.

507
00:49:11,493 --> 00:49:13,453
Why does it do that?

508
00:49:13,495 --> 00:49:17,499
The lightning talks to the thunder,
and the thunder answers.

509
00:49:17,541 --> 00:49:20,294
-The lightning must be nasty.
-Not really.

510
00:49:20,335 --> 00:49:22,838
Why does the thunder get so angry?

511
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:24,131
It makes me want to cry.

512
00:49:27,259 --> 00:49:31,263
Whenever I'm feeling unhappy,
I just try to think of nice things.

513
00:49:31,305 --> 00:49:33,140
What kind of things?

514
00:49:33,849 --> 00:49:36,310
Well, let me see. Nice things...

515
00:49:36,351 --> 00:49:37,769
Daffodils.

516
00:49:38,395 --> 00:49:40,022
Green meadows.

517
00:49:40,397 --> 00:49:42,691
Skies full of stars.

518
00:49:42,733 --> 00:49:46,028
Raindrops on roses
And whiskers on kittens

519
00:49:46,069 --> 00:49:49,531
Bright copper kettles
And warm woolen mittens

520
00:49:49,573 --> 00:49:52,910
Brown paper packages
Tied up with strings

521
00:49:52,951 --> 00:49:56,205
These are a few of my favorite things

522
00:49:59,416 --> 00:50:02,711
Cream-colored ponies
And crisp apple strudels

523
00:50:02,753 --> 00:50:05,923
Doorbells and sleigh bells
And schnitzel with noodles

524
00:50:05,964 --> 00:50:09,259
Wild geese that fly
With the moon on their wings

525
00:50:09,301 --> 00:50:12,763
These are a few of my favorite things

526
00:50:14,223 --> 00:50:17,142
Girls in white dresses
With blue satin sashes

527
00:50:17,184 --> 00:50:20,687
Snowflakes that stay
On my nose and eyelashes

528
00:50:20,729 --> 00:50:24,149
Silver white winters
That melt into springs

529
00:50:24,191 --> 00:50:27,569
These are a few of my favorite things

530
00:50:27,611 --> 00:50:29,488
When the dog bites

531
00:50:29,530 --> 00:50:31,406
When the bee stings

532
00:50:31,448 --> 00:50:33,951
When I'm feeling sad

533
00:50:33,992 --> 00:50:37,579
I simply remember my favorite things

534
00:50:37,621 --> 00:50:44,127
And then I don't feel so bad

535
00:50:45,170 --> 00:50:46,922
-Does it work?
-Of course.

536
00:50:46,964 --> 00:50:49,633
-What do you like?
-Pussy willow!

537
00:50:49,675 --> 00:50:52,177
-Christmas!
-Bunny rabbits!

538
00:50:52,219 --> 00:50:54,221
Snakes!

539
00:50:54,263 --> 00:50:56,473
-Chocolate icing!
-No school!

540
00:50:56,515 --> 00:50:58,058
Pillow fights!

541
00:50:58,100 --> 00:51:00,394
-Telegrams!
-Birthday presents!

542
00:51:00,435 --> 00:51:03,438
-Any presents!
-Ladybugs!

543
00:51:04,314 --> 00:51:05,899
A good sneeze!

544
00:51:05,941 --> 00:51:07,734
Gesundheit!

545
00:51:07,985 --> 00:51:09,570
See what fun it is?

546
00:51:09,611 --> 00:51:12,614
Raindrops on roses
And whiskers on kittens

547
00:51:12,656 --> 00:51:15,701
Bright copper kettles
And warm woolen mittens

548
00:51:15,742 --> 00:51:18,954
Brown paper packages
Tied up with strings

549
00:51:18,996 --> 00:51:22,291
These are a few of my favorite things

550
00:51:25,210 --> 00:51:28,297
Cream-colored ponies
And crisp apple strudels

551
00:51:28,338 --> 00:51:31,383
Doorbells and sleigh bells
And schnitzel with noodles

552
00:51:31,425 --> 00:51:34,553
Wild geese that fly
With the moon on their wings

553
00:51:34,595 --> 00:51:38,015
These are a few of my favorite things

554
00:51:39,141 --> 00:51:40,809
Together.

555
00:51:40,851 --> 00:51:43,979
Girls in white dresses
With blue satin sashes

556
00:51:44,021 --> 00:51:47,107
Snowflakes that stay
On my nose and eyelashes

557
00:51:47,149 --> 00:51:50,235
Silver white winters
That melt into springs

558
00:51:50,277 --> 00:51:53,822
These are a few of my favorite things

559
00:51:53,864 --> 00:51:55,407
When the dog...

560
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:57,618
Dog bites.

561
00:52:04,958 --> 00:52:06,251
Hello.

562
00:52:06,293 --> 00:52:10,672
Fräulein, did I not tell you that
bedtime is to be strictly observed?

563
00:52:10,714 --> 00:52:13,759
The children were upset
by the storm, so I...

564
00:52:14,885 --> 00:52:16,011
You did, sir.

565
00:52:16,053 --> 00:52:20,724
Do you, or do you not, have difficulty
remembering such simple instructions?

566
00:52:21,517 --> 00:52:23,644
Only during thunderstorms.

567
00:52:25,896 --> 00:52:27,356
-Liesl?
-Yes, Father?

568
00:52:27,397 --> 00:52:30,192
I don't recall seeing you after dinner.

569
00:52:30,234 --> 00:52:32,194
Really? As a matter of fact...

570
00:52:32,236 --> 00:52:33,487
Yes?

571
00:52:34,196 --> 00:52:35,531
Well, I was...

572
00:52:35,572 --> 00:52:37,866
What she would like to say

573
00:52:37,908 --> 00:52:40,953
is that she and I have
been getting acquainted tonight.

574
00:52:40,994 --> 00:52:45,832
It's too late to go into that.
You heard your father. Go back to bed.

575
00:52:50,587 --> 00:52:55,759
Fräulein, you have managed to remember
I'm leaving in the morning?

576
00:52:57,302 --> 00:53:01,932
Is it also possible you remember
the first rule in this house is discipline?

577
00:53:03,433 --> 00:53:05,936
Then I trust that before I return,

578
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:08,605
you'll have acquired some?

579
00:53:09,690 --> 00:53:11,108
Captain?

580
00:53:12,025 --> 00:53:16,196
Could I talk to you about clothes
for the children for when they play?

581
00:53:16,238 --> 00:53:19,116
-If I could have some material.
-You are many things.

582
00:53:19,157 --> 00:53:21,577
Not the least of which is repetitious.

583
00:53:21,618 --> 00:53:23,912
-But they're children!
-Yes.

584
00:53:23,954 --> 00:53:25,789
And I'm their father.

585
00:53:26,290 --> 00:53:27,791
Good night.

586
00:53:51,815 --> 00:53:57,154
Girls in white dresses
With blue satin sashes

587
00:54:09,166 --> 00:54:12,920
When the dog bites
When the bee stings

588
00:54:12,961 --> 00:54:15,631
When I'm feeling sad

589
00:54:15,672 --> 00:54:19,009
I simply remember my favorite things

590
00:54:19,051 --> 00:54:21,553
And then I don't feel

591
00:54:21,595 --> 00:54:27,768
so bad

592
00:54:52,459 --> 00:54:55,170
Children, over here. See!

593
00:54:58,715 --> 00:55:00,092
Come on.

594
00:56:23,467 --> 00:56:24,718
Fräulein Maria?

595
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:26,803
Can we do this every day?

596
00:56:26,845 --> 00:56:30,516
-Don't you think you'd get tired of it?
-I suppose so.

597
00:56:30,557 --> 00:56:31,892
Every other day?

598
00:56:31,934 --> 00:56:36,688
I haven't had so much fun since we put
glue on Fräulein Josephine's toothbrush.

599
00:56:36,730 --> 00:56:40,859
I can't understand how children
as nice as you can play such tricks.

600
00:56:40,901 --> 00:56:42,903
-It's easy.
-But why do it?

601
00:56:42,945 --> 00:56:45,489
How else can we get Father's attention?

602
00:56:46,156 --> 00:56:47,741
Oh, I see.

603
00:56:49,159 --> 00:56:51,828
We'll have to think about that one.

604
00:56:53,455 --> 00:56:55,290
All right, over here.

605
00:56:55,332 --> 00:56:56,917
What are we going to do?

606
00:56:56,959 --> 00:56:59,127
Think of a song for the Baroness.

607
00:56:59,169 --> 00:57:01,338
Father doesn't like us to sing.

608
00:57:01,380 --> 00:57:05,175
Perhaps we can change his mind.
Now, what songs do you know?

609
00:57:05,217 --> 00:57:07,553
We don't know any songs.

610
00:57:07,594 --> 00:57:10,514
-Not any?
-We don't even know how to sing.

611
00:57:12,057 --> 00:57:14,351
Let's not lose time. You must learn.

612
00:57:14,393 --> 00:57:16,103
But how?

613
00:57:20,566 --> 00:57:24,027
Let's start at the very beginning

614
00:57:24,695 --> 00:57:27,865
A very good place to start

615
00:57:28,198 --> 00:57:30,576
When you read you begin with

616
00:57:30,617 --> 00:57:31,994
A, B, C

617
00:57:32,035 --> 00:57:36,331
When you sing, you begin with
Do-re-mi

618
00:57:36,373 --> 00:57:38,250
Do-re-mi

619
00:57:38,292 --> 00:57:39,918
Do-re-mi

620
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:43,964
The first three notes
Just happen to be

621
00:57:44,006 --> 00:57:45,841
Do-re-mi

622
00:57:45,883 --> 00:57:47,759
Do-re-mi

623
00:57:47,801 --> 00:57:50,929
Do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti

624
00:57:52,097 --> 00:57:54,600
Let's see if I can make it easier.

625
00:57:57,853 --> 00:58:01,356
"Doe," a deer
A female deer

626
00:58:01,815 --> 00:58:04,985
"Ray," a drop of golden sun

627
00:58:05,736 --> 00:58:09,406
"Me," a name I call myself

628
00:58:09,823 --> 00:58:12,826
"Far," a long, long way to run

629
00:58:13,577 --> 00:58:17,539
"Sew," a needle pulling thread

630
00:58:17,581 --> 00:58:21,752
"La," a note to follow sew

631
00:58:21,793 --> 00:58:25,297
"Tea," a drink with jam and bread

632
00:58:25,339 --> 00:58:29,801
That will bring us back to doe
Oh, oh, oh

633
00:58:29,843 --> 00:58:33,430
-Doe!
-A deer, a female deer

634
00:58:33,472 --> 00:58:36,433
-Ray!
-A drop of golden sun

635
00:58:37,142 --> 00:58:40,771
-Me!
-A name I call myself

636
00:58:40,812 --> 00:58:44,399
-Far!
-A long, long way to run

637
00:58:44,441 --> 00:58:47,903
Sew, a needle pulling thread

638
00:58:47,945 --> 00:58:51,740
-La!
-A note to follow sew

639
00:58:51,782 --> 00:58:54,785
-Tea
-A drink with jam and bread

640
00:58:54,826 --> 00:58:57,371
That will bring us back to

641
00:58:57,412 --> 00:59:00,999
-Doe
-A deer, a female deer

642
00:59:01,041 --> 00:59:04,545
Ray, a drop of golden sun

643
00:59:04,586 --> 00:59:08,048
Me, a name I call myself

644
00:59:08,090 --> 00:59:11,593
Far, a long, long way to run

645
00:59:11,635 --> 00:59:14,972
Sew, a needle pulling thread

646
00:59:15,013 --> 00:59:18,559
La, a note to follow sew

647
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:21,520
Tea, a drink with jam and bread

648
00:59:21,562 --> 00:59:25,774
That will bring us back to doe

649
00:59:25,816 --> 00:59:28,777
Do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti-do, so-do

650
00:59:29,403 --> 00:59:34,199
Do-re-mi-fa-so and so on are only
the tools we use to build a song.

651
00:59:34,241 --> 00:59:37,286
Once you have them in your head
you can sing different tunes

652
00:59:37,327 --> 00:59:39,663
by mixing them up. Like this.

653
00:59:41,123 --> 00:59:46,378
So-do-la-fa-mi-do-re

654
00:59:46,670 --> 00:59:48,130
Can you do that?

655
00:59:48,172 --> 00:59:53,886
So-do-la-fa-mi-do-re

656
00:59:53,927 --> 00:59:59,766
So-do-la-ti-do-re-do

657
00:59:59,808 --> 01:00:05,189
So-do-la-ti-do-re-do

658
01:00:05,230 --> 01:00:07,191
Now, put it all together.

659
01:00:07,232 --> 01:00:13,530
So-do-la-fa-mi-do-re

660
01:00:14,198 --> 01:00:20,370
So-do-la-ti-do-re-do

661
01:00:20,704 --> 01:00:23,415
-Good.
-But it doesn't mean anything.

662
01:00:23,457 --> 01:00:26,793
So we put in words.
One word for every note.

663
01:00:26,835 --> 01:00:28,170
Like this.

664
01:00:28,212 --> 01:00:34,343
When you know the notes to sing

665
01:00:35,219 --> 01:00:41,183
You can sing most anything

666
01:00:41,225 --> 01:00:42,309
Together!

667
01:00:42,351 --> 01:00:48,607
When you know the notes to sing

668
01:00:49,233 --> 01:00:55,614
You can sing most anything

669
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:59,701
-Doe
-A deer, a female deer

670
01:00:59,743 --> 01:01:03,205
-Ray
-A drop of golden sun

671
01:01:03,247 --> 01:01:06,708
-Me
-A name I call myself

672
01:01:06,750 --> 01:01:10,212
-Far
-A long long way to run

673
01:01:10,254 --> 01:01:13,590
-Sew
-A needle pulling thread

674
01:01:13,632 --> 01:01:17,219
-La
-A note to follow sew

675
01:01:17,261 --> 01:01:20,305
-Tea
-A drink with jam and bread

676
01:01:20,347 --> 01:01:24,393
That will bring us back to doe

677
01:01:24,434 --> 01:01:25,519
-Do
-Re

678
01:01:25,561 --> 01:01:26,603
-Mi
-Fa

679
01:01:26,645 --> 01:01:27,688
-So
-La

680
01:01:27,729 --> 01:01:28,772
-Ti
-Do, do

681
01:01:28,814 --> 01:01:29,857
-Ti
-La

682
01:01:29,898 --> 01:01:30,899
-So
-Fa

683
01:01:30,941 --> 01:01:32,025
-Mi
-Re

684
01:01:32,067 --> 01:01:33,068
-Do
-Mi, mi

685
01:01:33,110 --> 01:01:34,653
-Mi
-So, so

686
01:01:34,695 --> 01:01:36,405
-Re
-Fa, fa

687
01:01:36,446 --> 01:01:37,906

01:01:37,948 --> 01:01:38,991

689
01:01:39,032 --> 01:01:40,075

-So, so

690
01:01:40,117 --> 01:01:41,118
-Re
-Fa, fa

691
01:01:41,159 --> 01:01:42,244
-La
-Ti, ti

692
01:01:42,286 --> 01:01:48,750
When you know the notes to sing

693
01:01:48,792 --> 01:01:55,132
You can sing most anything

694
01:01:55,716 --> 01:01:59,136
Doe!
A deer, a female deer

695
01:01:59,178 --> 01:02:02,639
Ray!
A drop of golden sun

696
01:02:02,931 --> 01:02:06,560
Me!
A name I call myself

697
01:02:06,602 --> 01:02:09,313
Far!
A long long way to run

698
01:02:10,105 --> 01:02:13,275
Sew!
A needle pulling thread

699
01:02:13,650 --> 01:02:16,653
La!
A note to follow sew

700
01:02:17,196 --> 01:02:20,240
Tea!
A drink with jam and bread

701
01:02:20,282 --> 01:02:24,286
That will bring us back to

702
01:02:24,328 --> 01:02:31,168
So-do-la-fa-mi-do-re

703
01:02:31,210 --> 01:02:35,964
So-do-la-fa-ti

704
01:02:36,006 --> 01:02:38,217
La-so

705
01:02:38,258 --> 01:02:39,551
Fa

706
01:02:39,593 --> 01:02:41,136
Mi-re

707
01:02:41,178 --> 01:02:47,226
Ti-do

708
01:02:47,267 --> 01:02:48,519
So-do!

709
01:03:02,366 --> 01:03:05,661
The mountains are magnificent,
really magnificent.

710
01:03:05,702 --> 01:03:08,539
I had them put up just for you.

711
01:03:08,580 --> 01:03:11,083
Even if it's to a height of 10,000 feet,

712
01:03:11,124 --> 01:03:14,670
Georg always believes in
"rising to the occasion."

713
01:03:14,711 --> 01:03:17,673
Improve the jokes or I'll disinvite you.

714
01:03:17,714 --> 01:03:20,551
You didn't invite me. I invited myself.

715
01:03:20,592 --> 01:03:23,345
-Naturally.
-You needed a chaperone,

716
01:03:23,387 --> 01:03:26,306
and I needed a place
where the cuisine is superb,

717
01:03:26,348 --> 01:03:29,309
the wine cellar unexcelled,

718
01:03:29,351 --> 01:03:31,812
and the price perfect.

719
01:03:32,229 --> 01:03:34,314
Max, you are outrageous.

720
01:03:34,356 --> 01:03:38,360
Not at all. I'm a very charming sponge.

721
01:03:40,863 --> 01:03:42,197
Listen.

722
01:03:44,283 --> 01:03:46,952
That's the Klopmann Monastery Choir.

723
01:03:49,705 --> 01:03:51,290
They're good.

724
01:03:52,249 --> 01:03:53,876
Very good.

725
01:03:54,751 --> 01:03:57,546
I must explore this area
in the next few days.

726
01:03:57,588 --> 01:04:01,300
Somewhere, a hungry singing group
is waiting for Max Detweiler

727
01:04:01,341 --> 01:04:05,762
to pluck it out and make it famous
at the Salzburg Folk Festival.

728
01:04:05,804 --> 01:04:09,391
-They get fame, you get money.
-It's unfair, I admit it.

729
01:04:09,433 --> 01:04:13,312
But someday that'll be changed.
I shall get the fame, too.

730
01:04:20,819 --> 01:04:22,988
Good heavens, what's this?

731
01:04:24,323 --> 01:04:27,034
It's nothing. Just some local urchins.

732
01:04:41,965 --> 01:04:45,844
This really is exciting for me, Georg.
Being here with you.

733
01:04:46,803 --> 01:04:49,515
Trees, lakes, you've seen them before.

734
01:04:49,556 --> 01:04:52,309
That is not what I mean, and you know it.

735
01:04:52,351 --> 01:04:56,605
-You mean me? I'm exciting?
-Is that so impossible?

736
01:04:56,647 --> 01:04:59,942
No, just highly improbable.

737
01:04:59,983 --> 01:05:04,154
-There you go, running yourself down.
-Well, I'm a dangerous driver.

738
01:05:07,824 --> 01:05:11,662
You're much less of a riddle
when I see you here, Georg.

739
01:05:11,703 --> 01:05:14,790
-In my natural habitat?
-Yes, exactly.

740
01:05:14,831 --> 01:05:17,251
Are you saying that I'm more at home

741
01:05:17,292 --> 01:05:21,463
among the birds and the flowers
and the wind that moves

742
01:05:21,505 --> 01:05:23,966
through the trees like a restless sea?

743
01:05:24,007 --> 01:05:25,676
How poetic.

744
01:05:25,717 --> 01:05:28,053
Yes, it was rather, wasn't it?

745
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:33,976
More at home here than in Vienna
in all your glittering salons,

746
01:05:34,017 --> 01:05:38,772
gossiping gaily with bores I detest,
soaking myself in champagne,

747
01:05:38,814 --> 01:05:42,651
stumbling about to waltzes
by Strausses I can't even remember?

748
01:05:42,693 --> 01:05:45,028
-Is that what you're saying?
-Yes.

749
01:05:45,070 --> 01:05:47,531
Now whatever gave you that idea?

750
01:05:50,784 --> 01:05:54,663
Oh, I do like it here, Georg.
It's so lovely and peaceful.

751
01:05:55,163 --> 01:05:57,040
How can you leave it so often?

752
01:05:57,082 --> 01:06:00,252
Oh, pretending to be madly active,
I suppose.

753
01:06:00,294 --> 01:06:03,547
Activity suggests a life filled with purpose.

754
01:06:04,339 --> 01:06:07,259
Could it be running away from memories?

755
01:06:09,720 --> 01:06:13,682
Or perhaps just searching
for a reason to stay.

756
01:06:14,349 --> 01:06:17,978
I hope that's why you've been
coming to Vienna so often.

757
01:06:18,520 --> 01:06:22,816
-Were there other distractions?
-I'd hardly call you a distraction.

758
01:06:23,066 --> 01:06:25,736
Well, what would you call me, Georg?

759
01:06:27,946 --> 01:06:29,239
Lovely,

760
01:06:30,199 --> 01:06:33,160
charming, witty, graceful,
the perfect hostess,

761
01:06:33,202 --> 01:06:36,288
and, you're going to hate me for this,

762
01:06:36,330 --> 01:06:38,874
in a way, my savior.

763
01:06:38,916 --> 01:06:40,834
Oh, how unromantic.

764
01:06:40,876 --> 01:06:43,378
I'd be an ungrateful wretch if I didn't say

765
01:06:43,420 --> 01:06:46,673
that you brought some meaning back
into my life.

766
01:06:48,425 --> 01:06:51,386
I am amusing, I suppose.

767
01:06:51,428 --> 01:06:56,391
I have the finest couturier in Vienna
and a glittering circle of friends.

768
01:06:56,433 --> 01:06:59,728
-I do give some rather gay parties.
-Oh, yes.

769
01:06:59,770 --> 01:07:01,813
But take all that away,

770
01:07:01,855 --> 01:07:06,235
and you have just wealthy,
unattached little me

771
01:07:06,944 --> 01:07:09,363
searching, just like you.

772
01:07:14,451 --> 01:07:16,370
More strudel, Herr Detweiler?

773
01:07:16,411 --> 01:07:18,205
-How many have I had?
-Two.

774
01:07:18,247 --> 01:07:20,290
Make it an uneven three.

775
01:07:23,460 --> 01:07:26,630
Still eating, Max? Must be unhappy.

776
01:07:26,672 --> 01:07:30,843
That mixed quartet I've been trying
to steal away from Sol Hurok...

777
01:07:30,884 --> 01:07:33,762
-What happened?
-Sascha Petrie stole them first.

778
01:07:33,804 --> 01:07:35,305
I hate thieves.

779
01:07:35,347 --> 01:07:38,809
Max, you really must try
and learn to love yourself.

780
01:07:38,851 --> 01:07:41,436
I had to call Paris, Rome and Stockholm.

781
01:07:41,478 --> 01:07:45,440
-On Georg's telephone, of course.
-How else could I afford it?

782
01:07:45,482 --> 01:07:50,904
I like rich people, the way they live
and how I live when I'm with them.

783
01:07:50,946 --> 01:07:53,282
I wonder where the children are.

784
01:07:53,323 --> 01:07:56,118
They must have heard
I was coming and hid.

785
01:07:56,159 --> 01:07:59,121
I was hoping they'd be here
to welcome you.

786
01:07:59,162 --> 01:08:03,667
Max, do step out of character for
a moment and try and be charming.

787
01:08:12,342 --> 01:08:13,760
Well?

788
01:08:14,761 --> 01:08:16,138
Well what?

789
01:08:16,180 --> 01:08:19,349
Have you made up his mind?
Do I hear wedding bells?

790
01:08:19,390 --> 01:08:21,350
-Pealing madly.
-Marvelous.

791
01:08:21,810 --> 01:08:24,479
-Not necessarily for me.
-What kind of talk's that?

792
01:08:24,520 --> 01:08:26,273
None-of-your-business talk.

793
01:08:26,314 --> 01:08:29,151
I'm terribly fond of Georg,
so don't toy with us.

794
01:08:29,193 --> 01:08:32,613
But I'm a child. I like toys.
So, tell me everything.

795
01:08:33,197 --> 01:08:38,327
Come on. Tell me every teensy-weensy,
intimate, disgusting detail.

796
01:08:39,536 --> 01:08:43,665
Well, let's just say, I have a feeling
I may be here on approval.

797
01:08:43,916 --> 01:08:47,127
-I approve of that. How can you miss?
-Far too easily.

798
01:08:47,169 --> 01:08:50,714
If I know you, darling, and I do,
you will find a way.

799
01:08:50,756 --> 01:08:53,383
-He's no ordinary man.
-No, he's rich.

800
01:08:53,634 --> 01:08:55,928
His wife's death gave him
a great heartache.

801
01:08:55,969 --> 01:08:59,180
And your husband's death
gave you a great fortune.

802
01:08:59,515 --> 01:09:01,433
Max, you really are a beast.

803
01:09:01,475 --> 01:09:05,645
You and Georg are like family to me.
That's why I want to see you two married.

804
01:09:05,687 --> 01:09:08,899
We must keep all that lovely money
in the family.

805
01:09:25,582 --> 01:09:28,752
-What are you doing there?
-Captain von Trapp.

806
01:09:28,794 --> 01:09:30,837
I was just looking for...

807
01:09:31,712 --> 01:09:34,800
I didn't see, I mean,
I didn't know you were...

808
01:09:35,091 --> 01:09:36,551
Heil Hitler!

809
01:09:37,511 --> 01:09:38,929
Who are you?

810
01:09:39,263 --> 01:09:41,640
I have a telegram for Herr Detweiler.

811
01:09:41,682 --> 01:09:44,434
-I am Herr Detweiler.
-Yes, sir.

812
01:09:49,314 --> 01:09:52,276
You've delivered your telegram.
Now get out.

813
01:09:59,324 --> 01:10:02,661
-Georg, he's just a boy.
-Yes, and I'm just an Austrian.

814
01:10:02,703 --> 01:10:05,539
Things will happen.
Make sure they don't happen to you.

815
01:10:05,581 --> 01:10:08,083
Max! Don't you ever say that again.

816
01:10:08,917 --> 01:10:11,003
I have no political convictions.

817
01:10:11,044 --> 01:10:14,381
-Can I help it if other people do?
-You can help it.

818
01:10:14,965 --> 01:10:16,633
You must help it.

819
01:10:27,603 --> 01:10:28,812
Hello?

820
01:10:31,648 --> 01:10:33,984
You're far away. Where are you?

821
01:10:34,860 --> 01:10:38,280
In a world that's disappearing, I'm afraid.

822
01:10:39,489 --> 01:10:43,243
Is there any way I could bring you
back to the world I'm in?

823
01:11:09,019 --> 01:11:11,605
-Father! Father!
-There's your father!

824
01:11:12,314 --> 01:11:14,316
Oh, Captain, you're home!

825
01:11:23,367 --> 01:11:25,661
Come out of that water at once!

826
01:11:35,045 --> 01:11:37,548
Oh, you must be Baroness Schraeder.

827
01:11:42,845 --> 01:11:45,055
I'm soaked to the skin!

828
01:11:57,734 --> 01:11:59,278
Straight line!

829
01:12:13,750 --> 01:12:15,878
This is Baroness Schraeder.

830
01:12:18,672 --> 01:12:19,923
And these

831
01:12:20,674 --> 01:12:22,259
are my children.

832
01:12:23,343 --> 01:12:24,845
How do you do?

833
01:12:25,846 --> 01:12:30,225
Go inside, dry off, clean up, change
your clothes and report back here!

834
01:12:35,689 --> 01:12:38,275
Fräulein, you will stay here, please!

835
01:12:39,526 --> 01:12:43,071
I think I'd better go see
what Max is up to.

836
01:12:53,373 --> 01:12:55,000
Now, Fräulein,

837
01:12:56,960 --> 01:12:59,129
I want a truthful answer.

838
01:12:59,463 --> 01:13:00,923
Yes, Captain.

839
01:13:01,215 --> 01:13:05,302
Is it possible,
or could I have just imagined it?

840
01:13:06,845 --> 01:13:11,308
Have my children, by any chance,
been climbing trees today?

841
01:13:11,767 --> 01:13:13,227
Yes, Captain.

842
01:13:13,977 --> 01:13:15,312
I see.

843
01:13:15,896 --> 01:13:20,400
And where, may I ask,
did they get these...

844
01:13:20,734 --> 01:13:22,736
-Play clothes.
-Is that what they are?

845
01:13:22,778 --> 01:13:26,532
I made them from the drapes
that used to hang in my bedroom.

846
01:13:27,157 --> 01:13:29,451
-Drapes?
-They have plenty of wear left.

847
01:13:29,493 --> 01:13:31,453
We've been everywhere in them.

848
01:13:31,495 --> 01:13:36,291
Are you telling me that my children
have been roaming about Salzburg

849
01:13:36,333 --> 01:13:39,670
dressed up in nothing
but some old drapes?

850
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:41,755
And having a marvelous time!

851
01:13:41,797 --> 01:13:44,341
-They have uniforms.
-Forgive me, straitjackets.

852
01:13:44,383 --> 01:13:45,592
I will not forgive you for that.

853
01:13:45,634 --> 01:13:48,262
They can't be children
if they worry about clothes...

854
01:13:48,303 --> 01:13:49,638
They don't complain.

855
01:13:49,680 --> 01:13:52,558
They don't dare.
They love you too much and fear...

856
01:13:52,599 --> 01:13:54,309
Don't discuss my children.

857
01:13:54,351 --> 01:13:56,478
You've got to hear, you're never home...

858
01:13:56,520 --> 01:13:58,146
I don't want to hear more!

859
01:13:58,188 --> 01:14:00,732
I know you don't, but you've got to!

860
01:14:01,525 --> 01:14:03,944
-Liesl's not a child.
-Not one word...

861
01:14:03,986 --> 01:14:07,072
Soon she'll be a woman
and you won't even know her.

862
01:14:07,114 --> 01:14:10,409
Friedrich wants to be a man
but you're not here to show...

863
01:14:10,450 --> 01:14:11,994
Don't you dare tell me...

864
01:14:12,035 --> 01:14:15,497
Brigitta could tell you about him.
She notices everything.

865
01:14:15,539 --> 01:14:18,834
Kurt acts tough to hide the pain
when you ignore him

866
01:14:18,876 --> 01:14:20,627
-the way you do all of them.
-That will do.

867
01:14:20,669 --> 01:14:23,297
Louisa, I don't know about yet.

868
01:14:23,338 --> 01:14:26,758
The little ones just want love.
Please, love them all.

869
01:14:26,800 --> 01:14:28,510
I don't care to hear more.

870
01:14:28,552 --> 01:14:32,681
-I am not finished yet, Captain!
-Oh, yes, you are, Captain!

871
01:14:34,057 --> 01:14:35,350
Fräulein.

872
01:14:37,644 --> 01:14:40,230
You will pack your things this minute

873
01:14:41,023 --> 01:14:42,983
and return to the abbey.

874
01:14:46,069 --> 01:14:47,487
What's that?

875
01:14:49,364 --> 01:14:50,866
It's singing.

876
01:14:50,908 --> 01:14:53,994
Yes, I realize it's singing.
But who is singing?

877
01:14:54,661 --> 01:14:56,121
The children.

878
01:14:59,249 --> 01:15:00,751
The children?

879
01:15:01,001 --> 01:15:04,171
I taught them something to sing
for the Baroness.

880
01:15:09,384 --> 01:15:15,641
My heart wants to sing
Every song it hears

881
01:15:15,682 --> 01:15:18,268
Every song that it hears

882
01:15:18,519 --> 01:15:24,191
My heart wants to beat like the wings
Of the birds that rise

883
01:15:24,233 --> 01:15:27,569
From the lake to the trees

884
01:15:27,611 --> 01:15:29,238
To the trees

885
01:15:29,279 --> 01:15:34,034
My heart wants to sigh
Like a chime that flies

886
01:15:34,409 --> 01:15:39,081
From a church on a breeze

887
01:15:39,122 --> 01:15:43,418
To laugh like a brook
When it trips and falls

888
01:15:43,460 --> 01:15:46,588
Over stones on its way

889
01:15:46,630 --> 01:15:48,257
On its way

890
01:15:48,298 --> 01:15:52,427
To sing through the night

891
01:15:52,970 --> 01:15:58,642
Like a lark who is learning to pray

892
01:15:58,892 --> 01:16:03,063
I go to the hills

893
01:16:03,605 --> 01:16:08,610
When my heart is lonely

894
01:16:09,987 --> 01:16:13,615
I know I will hear

895
01:16:13,991 --> 01:16:19,830
What I've heard before

896
01:16:20,664 --> 01:16:24,918
My heart will be blessed

897
01:16:25,169 --> 01:16:31,508
With the sound of music

898
01:16:33,093 --> 01:16:37,931
And I'll sing

899
01:16:38,432 --> 01:16:45,355
Once more

900
01:17:19,890 --> 01:17:21,266
Edelweiss!

901
01:17:25,646 --> 01:17:28,941
You never told me how enchanting
your children are.

902
01:17:37,324 --> 01:17:38,825
Don't go away.

903
01:17:43,997 --> 01:17:45,249
Fräulein.

904
01:17:48,752 --> 01:17:49,795
I

905
01:17:51,380 --> 01:17:54,216
behaved badly. I apologize.

906
01:17:56,009 --> 01:17:59,263
I'm far too outspoken.
It's one of my worst faults.

907
01:17:59,930 --> 01:18:01,473
You were right.

908
01:18:03,892 --> 01:18:05,894
I don't know my children.

909
01:18:07,104 --> 01:18:11,149
There's still time, Captain.
They want so much to be close to you.

910
01:18:11,525 --> 01:18:15,404
And you brought music back
into the house.

911
01:18:16,738 --> 01:18:18,240
I'd forgotten.

912
01:18:20,909 --> 01:18:22,160
Fräulein.

913
01:18:24,746 --> 01:18:26,456
I want you to stay.

914
01:18:30,043 --> 01:18:32,796
I ask you to stay.

915
01:18:34,631 --> 01:18:37,634
-If I could be of any help.
-You have already.

916
01:18:38,719 --> 01:18:40,470
More than you know.

917
01:18:59,489 --> 01:19:00,657
Marta.

918
01:19:01,491 --> 01:19:02,743
Curtain!

919
01:19:05,537 --> 01:19:07,873
High on a hill was a lonely goatherd

920
01:19:07,915 --> 01:19:10,334
Lay odl lay odl lay hee hoo

921
01:19:10,375 --> 01:19:12,753

Lay odl lay odl loo

923
01:19:15,005 --> 01:19:17,424

Lay odl lay odl lay hee hoo

925

Gretl, the prince!

931
01:19:43,700 --> 01:19:46,328
A prince on the bridge
Of a castle moat heard

932
01:19:46,370 --> 01:19:48,789
Lay odl lay odl lay hee hoo

933

01:20:12,479 --> 01:20:14,731

Very good!

975
01:22:13,100 --> 01:22:15,018
Wonderful!

976
01:22:15,853 --> 01:22:18,939
-Can we keep the puppets, Uncle Max?
-Yes, can we?

977
01:22:18,981 --> 01:22:21,316
Of course you may, my darlings.

978
01:22:21,358 --> 01:22:25,612
Why else did I tell Professor Kohner
to send the bill to your father?

979
01:22:29,157 --> 01:22:30,909
Well done, Fräulein.

980
01:22:33,370 --> 01:22:35,497
I really am very much impressed.

981
01:22:35,539 --> 01:22:37,875
They're your children, Captain.

982
01:22:44,715 --> 01:22:47,259
My dear, is there anything you can't do?

983
01:22:47,301 --> 01:22:49,803
Well, I'm not sure I'll make a good nun.

984
01:22:49,845 --> 01:22:53,098
If you have any problems,
I'd be happy to help you.

985
01:22:56,310 --> 01:22:57,686
Attention, everyone!

986
01:22:57,728 --> 01:23:01,064
I have an announcement to make.
Surprise! Surprise!

987
01:23:01,523 --> 01:23:03,942
Today, after a long and desperate search

988
01:23:03,984 --> 01:23:08,447
I have found a most exciting entry
for the Salzburg Folk Festival.

989
01:23:09,198 --> 01:23:10,991
Congratulations, Max.

990
01:23:11,241 --> 01:23:13,994
And who will you
be exploiting this time?

991
01:23:15,996 --> 01:23:19,249
-The Saint Ignatius Choir?
-Guess again.

992
01:23:19,917 --> 01:23:24,046
Well, let me see now.
The Klopmann Choir?

993
01:23:24,087 --> 01:23:26,381
-No, no, no, no.
-No, no?

994
01:23:26,715 --> 01:23:27,925
Tell us.

995
01:23:28,258 --> 01:23:31,887
A singing group all in one family.
You'll never guess, Georg.

996
01:23:31,929 --> 01:23:34,681
What a charming idea!

997
01:23:35,432 --> 01:23:36,934
Whose family?

998
01:23:37,601 --> 01:23:38,769
Yours.

999
01:23:39,436 --> 01:23:41,980
They'll be the talk of the festival.

1000
01:23:44,608 --> 01:23:47,444
-Well, now, what's so funny?
-You are, Max.

1001
01:23:47,903 --> 01:23:50,906
You're expensive, but very funny.

1002
01:23:51,782 --> 01:23:54,326
-They'll be a sensation!
-No, Max.

1003
01:23:54,368 --> 01:23:56,703
It's a wonderful idea.
Fresh, original.

1004
01:23:56,745 --> 01:24:00,916
Max! My children do not sing in public.

1005
01:24:02,876 --> 01:24:04,545
You can't blame me for trying.

1006
01:24:04,586 --> 01:24:07,214
Children, who shall we hear from next?

1007
01:24:10,217 --> 01:24:11,301
Who?

1008
01:24:17,474 --> 01:24:18,559
Yes.

1009
01:24:21,645 --> 01:24:23,480
The vote is unanimous.

1010
01:24:24,398 --> 01:24:25,858
You, Captain.

1011
01:24:26,233 --> 01:24:27,276
Me?

1012
01:24:28,277 --> 01:24:30,404
-I don't understand.
-Please.

1013
01:24:36,785 --> 01:24:39,121
No, no, no, no.

1014
01:24:39,162 --> 01:24:41,373
I'm told that you were quite good.

1015
01:24:41,415 --> 01:24:44,960
-That was a very, very long time ago.
-I remember, Father.

1016
01:24:45,002 --> 01:24:48,088
-Play us something we know.
-Oh, please, Father.

1017
01:24:50,757 --> 01:24:51,842
Well...

1018
01:25:02,102 --> 01:25:04,479
-Why didn't you tell me?
-What?

1019
01:25:04,521 --> 01:25:06,648
To bring along my harmonica.

1020
01:25:08,859 --> 01:25:10,986
Edelweiss

1021
01:25:12,654 --> 01:25:14,948
Edelweiss

1022
01:25:16,033 --> 01:25:22,664
Every morning you greet me

1023

Small and white

1024
01:25:26,376 --> 01:25:30,005
Clean and bright

1025
01:25:30,047 --> 01:25:33,175
You look happy

1026
01:25:33,217 --> 01:25:37,179
To meet me

1027
01:25:37,221 --> 01:25:39,848
Blossom of snow

1028
01:25:39,890 --> 01:25:44,311
May you bloom and grow

1029
01:25:44,353 --> 01:25:50,734
Bloom and grow forever

1030
01:25:51,568 --> 01:25:54,863
Edelweiss

1031
01:25:55,405 --> 01:25:58,534
Edelweiss

1032
01:25:58,575 --> 01:26:05,541
Bless my homeland forever

-Small and white
-Small and white

1037
01:26:28,063 --> 01:26:31,650

You look happy

1039
01:26:34,444 --> 01:26:38,365
To meet me

1040
01:26:38,407 --> 01:26:40,868
Blossom of snow

1041
01:26:40,909 --> 01:26:45,080
May you bloom and grow

1042
01:26:45,122 --> 01:26:52,087
Bloom and grow forever

1043
01:26:52,421 --> 01:26:55,757
Edelweiss

1044
01:26:56,466 --> 01:26:59,261
Edelweiss

1045
01:26:59,595 --> 01:27:06,560
Bless my homeland forever

1046
01:27:19,031 --> 01:27:22,784
Anytime you say the word, Georg,
you can be part of my new act,

1047
01:27:22,826 --> 01:27:25,329
The von Trapp Family Singers.

1048
01:27:26,413 --> 01:27:28,707
I have a wonderful idea, Georg.

1049
01:27:29,166 --> 01:27:31,793
Let's really fill this house with music.

1050
01:27:31,835 --> 01:27:35,047
You must give a grand
and glorious party for me.

1051
01:27:35,088 --> 01:27:38,091
-A party?
-Yes, Father, please!

1052
01:27:38,133 --> 01:27:40,594
It's high time I met all your friends

1053
01:27:40,636 --> 01:27:43,138
and they met me.
Don't you agree?

1054
01:27:43,430 --> 01:27:45,891
-I see what you mean.
-Oh, please!

1055
01:27:45,933 --> 01:27:49,102
Children, it's bedtime.
Come now, say good night.

1056
01:27:50,020 --> 01:27:51,480
Good night, Father.

1057
01:27:51,522 --> 01:27:54,566
-Good night.
-Good night, Baroness Schraeder.

1058
01:27:54,608 --> 01:27:56,360
Good night, Father.

1059
01:27:59,154 --> 01:28:01,031
Good night, Uncle Max.

1060
01:28:02,866 --> 01:28:05,369
It'll be my first party, Father!

1061
01:28:38,569 --> 01:28:41,363
-Captain.
-Herr Zeller. Baroness Schraeder.

1062
01:28:41,405 --> 01:28:44,366
-Good evening, Herr Zeller.
-Baroness.

1063
01:28:45,868 --> 01:28:48,412
How do you do? Good evening.

1064
01:29:08,932 --> 01:29:12,477
Did you notice the obvious
display of the Austrian flag?

1065
01:29:19,443 --> 01:29:21,486
The women look so beautiful.

1066
01:29:21,528 --> 01:29:23,071
I think they look ugly.

1067
01:29:23,113 --> 01:29:25,240
You're just scared of them.

1068
01:29:25,282 --> 01:29:27,993
Silly, only grown-up men fear women.

1069
01:29:28,035 --> 01:29:31,872
-I think the men look beautiful.
-How would you know?

1070
01:29:48,805 --> 01:29:51,058
Liesl, who are you dancing with?

1071
01:29:51,099 --> 01:29:52,309
Nobody.

1072
01:29:53,560 --> 01:29:55,187
Oh, yes, you are.

1073
01:29:57,940 --> 01:29:59,608
May I have this dance?

1074
01:29:59,650 --> 01:30:01,777
I'd be delighted, young man.

1075
01:30:08,825 --> 01:30:11,495
Why didn't you tell me
you could dance?

1076
01:30:11,828 --> 01:30:16,750
We feared you'd make us all dance.
The von Trapp Family Dancers.

1077
01:30:21,171 --> 01:30:23,048
What are they playing?

1078
01:30:23,090 --> 01:30:25,801
It's the Ländler.
An Austrian folk dance.

1079
01:30:25,843 --> 01:30:29,096
-Show me.
-I haven't danced since I was little.

1080
01:30:29,555 --> 01:30:31,473
You remember. Please?

1081
01:30:31,515 --> 01:30:33,141
-Well...
-Please.

1082
01:30:33,684 --> 01:30:35,894
All right. Come on over here.

1083
01:30:36,436 --> 01:30:39,273
Now you bow and I curtsy.

1084
01:30:40,190 --> 01:30:43,318
-Like this?
-Fine. Now we go for a little walk.

1085
01:30:43,360 --> 01:30:46,154
One, two, three. One, two, three.

1086
01:30:46,196 --> 01:30:50,951
One, two, three, step together.
Now, step hop, step hop.

1087
01:30:51,201 --> 01:30:53,996
Now turn under. Not quite.

1088
01:30:54,037 --> 01:30:58,041
This way. Hop step, hop. And under.

1089
01:30:58,709 --> 01:31:00,586
Kurt, we'll have to practice.

1090
01:31:00,627 --> 01:31:02,462
Do allow me, will you?

1091
01:32:30,133 --> 01:32:32,135
I don't remember any more.

1092
01:32:34,304 --> 01:32:36,515
-Your face is all red.
-Is it?

1093
01:32:37,975 --> 01:32:40,477
I don't suppose I'm used to dancing.

1094
01:32:42,813 --> 01:32:44,940
Why, that was beautifully done.

1095
01:32:44,982 --> 01:32:47,234
What a lovely couple you make.

1096
01:32:48,026 --> 01:32:49,862
It's time the children
said good night.

1097
01:32:49,903 --> 01:32:51,113
We'll be in the hall.

1098
01:32:51,154 --> 01:32:54,032
-We have something special prepared.
-Right!

1099
01:32:54,283 --> 01:32:55,742
Yes, come on!

1100
01:33:02,332 --> 01:33:04,877
All that needless worrying, Georg.

1101
01:33:04,918 --> 01:33:08,213
You thought you wouldn't find
a friend at the party.

1102
01:33:10,841 --> 01:33:14,344
-A bit chilly out tonight, isn't it?
-Oh, I don't know.

1103
01:33:14,678 --> 01:33:16,805
It seemed rather warm to me.

1104
01:33:20,976 --> 01:33:22,811
Ladies and gentlemen.

1105
01:33:22,853 --> 01:33:26,815
The children of Captain von Trapp
wish to say good night to you.

1106
01:33:41,205 --> 01:33:45,292
There's a sad sort of clanging
From the clock in the hall

1107
01:33:45,334 --> 01:33:48,962
And the bells in the steeple, too

1108
01:33:49,338 --> 01:33:53,342
And up in the nursery
An absurd little bird

1109
01:33:53,383 --> 01:33:56,261
Is popping up to say "coo-coo"

1110
01:33:56,303 --> 01:33:58,180
Coo-coo

1111
01:33:58,222 --> 01:33:59,598
Coo-coo

1112
01:33:59,640 --> 01:34:01,600
-Regretfully, they tell us
-Coo-coo

1113
01:34:01,642 --> 01:34:03,644
-But firmly they compel us
-Coo-coo

1114
01:34:03,685 --> 01:34:06,855
-To say goodbye
-Coo-coo

1115
01:34:06,897 --> 01:34:12,069
To you

1116
01:34:15,572 --> 01:34:19,535
So long, farewell
Auf Wiedersehen, good night

1117
01:34:19,576 --> 01:34:23,830
I hate to go
And leave this pretty sight

1118
01:34:30,587 --> 01:34:34,550
So long, farewell
Auf Wiedersehen, adieu

1119
01:34:34,591 --> 01:34:38,470
Adieu, adieu
To you and you and you

1120
01:34:45,561 --> 01:34:49,398
So long, farewell
Au revoir, auf Wiedersehen

1121
01:34:49,439 --> 01:34:53,569
I'd like to stay
And taste my first champagne

1122
01:34:53,610 --> 01:34:55,779
-Yes?
-No.

1123
01:35:00,617 --> 01:35:04,580
So long, farewell
Auf Wiedersehen, goodbye

1124
01:35:04,621 --> 01:35:08,584
I leave and heave a sigh
And say goodbye

1125
01:35:08,625 --> 01:35:12,629
Goodbye

1126
01:35:15,799 --> 01:35:19,011
I'm glad to go

1127
01:35:19,052 --> 01:35:22,222
I cannot tell a lie

1128
01:35:22,264 --> 01:35:24,933
I flit, I float

1129
01:35:25,642 --> 01:35:28,896
I fleetly flee, I fly

1130
01:35:38,947 --> 01:35:44,870
The sun has gone to bed

1131
01:35:44,912 --> 01:35:48,832
And so must I

1132
01:35:48,874 --> 01:35:51,543
So long

1133
01:35:51,585 --> 01:35:54,338
Farewell

1134
01:35:54,379 --> 01:35:59,801
Auf Wiedersehen, goodbye

1135
01:36:00,135 --> 01:36:05,182
Goodbye

1136
01:36:05,974 --> 01:36:11,271
Goodbye

1137
01:36:11,772 --> 01:36:18,445
Goodbye

1138
01:36:18,695 --> 01:36:25,702
Goodbye

1139
01:36:32,584 --> 01:36:35,337
Extraordinary!
What they'd do at the festival.

1140
01:36:35,379 --> 01:36:38,048
Young lady,
I must have a word with you.

1141
01:36:38,841 --> 01:36:43,095
Georg, you won't let this girl get away.
She must join the party.

1142
01:36:43,136 --> 01:36:45,764
-No, really I...
-Stop. Stop it now.

1143
01:36:45,806 --> 01:36:48,934
-Georg, please.
-You can if you want to, Fräulein.

1144
01:36:48,976 --> 01:36:51,645
I insist.
You will be my dinner partner.

1145
01:36:51,687 --> 01:36:53,814
This is business. Franz

1146
01:36:53,856 --> 01:36:57,067
set another place next to mine
for Fräulein Maria.

1147
01:36:59,194 --> 01:37:02,406
-Whatever you say.
-It appears to be all arranged.

1148
01:37:02,698 --> 01:37:05,200
-It does.
-I'm not suitably dressed.

1149
01:37:05,659 --> 01:37:07,744
You can change. We'll wait.

1150
01:37:10,831 --> 01:37:13,834
Captain, you must be very proud
of your youngsters.

1151
01:37:13,876 --> 01:37:15,002
I am, thank you.

1152
01:37:15,043 --> 01:37:19,590
Is there a more beautiful expression
of what is good in our country

1153
01:37:19,923 --> 01:37:22,718
than the innocent voices of our children?

1154
01:37:23,677 --> 01:37:25,220
Oh, come now, Baron.

1155
01:37:25,262 --> 01:37:29,349
Would you have us believe that Austria
holds a monopoly on virtue?

1156
01:37:29,933 --> 01:37:34,354
Herr Zeller, some of us prefer
Austrian voices raised in song

1157
01:37:34,396 --> 01:37:36,773
to ugly German threats.

1158
01:37:37,774 --> 01:37:41,570
The ostrich buries his head in the sand

1159
01:37:41,612 --> 01:37:44,281
and sometimes in the flag.

1160
01:37:45,073 --> 01:37:49,494
Perhaps those who would warn you that
the Anschluss is coming, and it is,

1161
01:37:49,536 --> 01:37:53,415
would get further with you by
setting their words to music.

1162
01:37:53,457 --> 01:37:58,086
If the Nazis take over Austria,
you will be the entire trumpet section.

1163
01:37:58,587 --> 01:38:00,130
You flatter me.

1164
01:38:00,464 --> 01:38:03,842
Oh, how clumsy of me.
I meant to accuse you.

1165
01:38:12,142 --> 01:38:14,770
It's very kind of you
to offer to help me, Baroness.

1166
01:38:14,811 --> 01:38:16,647
I'm delighted, Maria.

1167
01:38:16,897 --> 01:38:20,817
I really don't think I have anything
that would be appropriate.

1168
01:38:21,109 --> 01:38:25,447
Now where is that lovely little thing
you were wearing the other evening?

1169
01:38:25,489 --> 01:38:28,575
When the Captain couldn't keep
his eyes off you.

1170
01:38:32,162 --> 01:38:34,373
Couldn't keep his eyes off me?

1171
01:38:35,290 --> 01:38:37,292
Come, my dear, we are women.

1172
01:38:37,334 --> 01:38:40,921
Let's not pretend we don't know
when a man notices us.

1173
01:38:40,963 --> 01:38:43,882
-Here we are.
-The Captain notices everybody.

1174
01:38:44,967 --> 01:38:47,636
There's no need to feel
so defensive, Maria.

1175
01:38:47,678 --> 01:38:50,180
You are quite attractive, you know.

1176
01:38:50,430 --> 01:38:54,101
The Captain would hardly be a man
if he didn't notice you.

1177
01:38:55,519 --> 01:38:57,855
Baroness, I hope you're joking.

1178
01:38:58,438 --> 01:38:59,898
Not at all.

1179
01:38:59,940 --> 01:39:01,733
I've never done a thing to...

1180
01:39:01,775 --> 01:39:03,861
You don't have to, my dear.

1181
01:39:04,111 --> 01:39:08,574
Nothing's more irresistible to a man
than a woman who's in love with him.

1182
01:39:10,033 --> 01:39:12,244
-In love with him?
-Of course.

1183
01:39:13,495 --> 01:39:17,040
What makes it so nice is
he thinks he's in love with you.

1184
01:39:19,626 --> 01:39:21,378
But that's not true.

1185
01:39:21,712 --> 01:39:25,174
Surely you've noticed the way
he looks into your eyes.

1186
01:39:25,465 --> 01:39:30,053
And you know, you blushed in his arms
when you were dancing just now.

1187
01:39:31,555 --> 01:39:33,473
Don't take it to heart.

1188
01:39:33,515 --> 01:39:36,018
He'll get over it soon enough, I think.

1189
01:39:36,059 --> 01:39:37,686
Men do, you know.

1190
01:39:39,229 --> 01:39:40,898
Then I should go.

1191
01:39:41,523 --> 01:39:43,317
I mustn't stay here.

1192
01:39:53,452 --> 01:39:56,747
-Is there something I can do to help?
-No, nothing.

1193
01:39:58,582 --> 01:39:59,666
Yes.

1194
01:40:01,210 --> 01:40:03,587
Don't say a word to the Captain.

1195
01:40:04,505 --> 01:40:07,508
No, I wouldn't dream of it.

1196
01:40:14,890 --> 01:40:16,433
Goodbye, Maria.

1197
01:40:17,351 --> 01:40:19,978
I'm sure you'll make a very fine nun.

1198
01:40:50,300 --> 01:40:52,094
Champagne, darling.

1199
01:40:52,636 --> 01:40:55,889
I feel like celebrating. Cheers.

1200
01:41:02,020 --> 01:41:04,898
-You know something.
-Perhaps.

1201
01:41:05,315 --> 01:41:09,528
If you're so clever, tell me how to
get Fräulein to influence Georg.

1202
01:41:09,987 --> 01:41:12,614
I want those children in the festival.

1203
01:41:12,990 --> 01:41:15,409
Elsa, this is important to Austria.

1204
01:41:15,450 --> 01:41:17,452
Wouldn't do you any harm either.

1205
01:41:17,494 --> 01:41:19,288
I thought of that.

1206
01:41:19,329 --> 01:41:21,874
Well, if it's a matter of influence

1207
01:41:21,915 --> 01:41:24,960
maybe the one you have
to be talking to is me.

1208
01:44:49,831 --> 01:44:52,042
-Two.
-Three.

1209
01:44:52,084 --> 01:44:54,044
-Four.
-Five.

1210
01:44:54,878 --> 01:44:56,964
-Six.
-Seven.

1211
01:44:57,381 --> 01:44:58,966
Eight.

1212
01:44:59,216 --> 01:45:01,301
-Four.
-Two.

1213
01:45:02,177 --> 01:45:03,929
-Seven.
-Five.

1214
01:45:03,971 --> 01:45:06,223
-Two.
-Six.

1215
01:45:11,061 --> 01:45:13,146
Isn't this fun?

1216
01:45:14,398 --> 01:45:16,817
-Four.
-I'm number five.

1217
01:45:17,067 --> 01:45:19,236
-Oh, yes.
-Eight.

1218
01:45:19,570 --> 01:45:21,905
-Two.
-Four.

1219
01:45:22,364 --> 01:45:23,574
Six.

1220
01:45:26,076 --> 01:45:27,327
Two.

1221
01:45:28,245 --> 01:45:31,540
Baroness Schraeder, do you mind
if we stop now? We're tired.

1222
01:45:31,582 --> 01:45:33,500
Whatever you want, dear.

1223
01:45:33,750 --> 01:45:35,752
We'll do it again tomorrow.

1224
01:45:45,846 --> 01:45:48,015
The country's so restful, isn't it?

1225
01:45:49,057 --> 01:45:50,684
Have some lemonade.

1226
01:45:51,894 --> 01:45:53,729
There must be an easier way.

1227
01:45:54,771 --> 01:45:58,108
I get a fiendish delight thinking
of you as the mother of seven.

1228
01:45:59,109 --> 01:46:01,111
How do you plan to do it?

1229
01:46:01,153 --> 01:46:03,322
Darling, haven't you ever heard

1230
01:46:03,363 --> 01:46:06,491
of a delightful little thing
called boarding school?

1231
01:46:07,576 --> 01:46:09,870
Baroness Machiavelli.

1232
01:46:11,163 --> 01:46:14,708
-Uncle Max, where's Father?
-I think he's in the house.

1233
01:46:15,459 --> 01:46:17,961
What's the matter
with all you gloomy pussies?

1234
01:46:18,378 --> 01:46:21,340
-Nothing.
-I know. Let's have a rehearsal.

1235
01:46:21,381 --> 01:46:22,424
What for?

1236
01:46:22,466 --> 01:46:25,093
Let's make believe we're on-stage
at the festival.

1237
01:46:25,135 --> 01:46:29,014
-I don't feel like singing.
-Not without Fräulein Maria.

1238
01:46:29,306 --> 01:46:31,892
Liesl, get the guitar.
Come on, Marta.

1239
01:46:31,934 --> 01:46:34,937
Everybody into the group.
Get in your places.

1240
01:46:34,978 --> 01:46:37,689
Now be cheerful, right?
Give us the key, Liesl.

1241
01:46:39,691 --> 01:46:42,361
Now, impress me.

1242
01:46:46,490 --> 01:46:48,075
Friedrich, Gretl, why don't you sing?

1243
01:46:48,116 --> 01:46:54,039
-I can't. I've got a sore finger.
-But you sang so beautifully at the party.

1244
01:46:54,748 --> 01:46:59,127
Come on, all of you. Try something
you know. Enjoy it. Be cheerful.

1245
01:46:59,169 --> 01:47:00,796
All right, Liesl.

1246
01:47:02,923 --> 01:47:07,761
The hills are alive

1247
01:47:08,637 --> 01:47:13,767
With the sound of music

1248
01:47:17,437 --> 01:47:21,692
With songs they have sung

1249
01:47:22,693 --> 01:47:27,865
For a thousand years

1250
01:47:31,201 --> 01:47:36,331
The hills fill my heart

1251
01:47:36,874 --> 01:47:43,213
With the sound of music

1252
01:47:44,715 --> 01:47:47,509
They wanted to sing for me,
bless their hearts.

1253
01:47:47,551 --> 01:47:49,469
That's lovely, lovely.
Don't stop.

1254
01:47:53,473 --> 01:47:57,394
-Something long and cool, Georg?
-No, thank you, darling.

1255
01:47:57,895 --> 01:48:00,272
-Father?
-Yes, Brigitta?

1256
01:48:00,772 --> 01:48:03,358
Is it true Fräulein Maria
isn't coming back?

1257
01:48:03,400 --> 01:48:06,445
Yes, I suppose it's true.
What have we got here?

1258
01:48:06,904 --> 01:48:10,866
-Pink lemonade.
-Laced with lemonade.

1259
01:48:12,159 --> 01:48:14,578
I don't believe it, Father.

1260
01:48:15,120 --> 01:48:17,539
-What?
-About Fräulein Maria.

1261
01:48:17,581 --> 01:48:18,999
Oh, Fräulein Maria!

1262
01:48:19,041 --> 01:48:22,544
Didn't I tell you what her note said?
I'm sure I did.

1263
01:48:23,253 --> 01:48:25,964
She said she missed her life
at the abbey.

1264
01:48:26,006 --> 01:48:28,217
She had to leave us.

1265
01:48:28,258 --> 01:48:29,885
And that's all there is to it.

1266
01:48:31,678 --> 01:48:34,348
I think I'm brave enough to try
some of that.

1267
01:48:34,598 --> 01:48:37,559
-She didn't even say goodbye.
-She did in her note.

1268
01:48:37,601 --> 01:48:39,436
That isn't the same thing.

1269
01:48:39,728 --> 01:48:41,396
Not too sweet, not too sour.

1270
01:48:42,105 --> 01:48:44,107
Just too pink.

1271
01:48:45,567 --> 01:48:49,404
Father, who is our new governess
going to be?

1272
01:48:55,452 --> 01:48:56,537
Well,

1273
01:48:58,872 --> 01:49:04,127
you're not going to have
a governess anymore.

1274
01:49:04,461 --> 01:49:07,130
-We're not?
-No.

1275
01:49:09,132 --> 01:49:11,218
You're going to have a new mother.

1276
01:49:12,302 --> 01:49:14,346
A new mother?

1277
01:49:15,264 --> 01:49:18,600
We talked about it last night.
It's all settled.

1278
01:49:18,642 --> 01:49:21,353
And we're all going to be very happy.

1279
01:49:54,136 --> 01:49:56,597
Well, all right, all right.
Run off and play.

1280
01:50:28,879 --> 01:50:30,088
Yes, my children?

1281
01:50:30,130 --> 01:50:32,591
-My name is Liesl.
-Yes, Liesl?

1282
01:50:33,008 --> 01:50:36,970
We, my brothers and sisters,
want to see Fräulein Maria.

1283
01:50:38,138 --> 01:50:40,140
Fräulein Maria?

1284
01:50:40,849 --> 01:50:42,851
Oh, Maria.

1285
01:50:44,728 --> 01:50:46,563
Come in, please.

1286
01:50:50,526 --> 01:50:52,027
Wait here.

1287
01:51:02,913 --> 01:51:06,375
I'm Sister Margaretta. I understand
you inquired about Maria.

1288
01:51:06,416 --> 01:51:09,127
We have to see her.
Will you tell her we're here?

1289
01:51:09,169 --> 01:51:11,964
-I'm afraid I can't do that.
-But you've got to!

1290
01:51:12,005 --> 01:51:13,882
-She's our governess.
-We want her back.

1291
01:51:13,924 --> 01:51:16,385
She didn't even say goodbye.

1292
01:51:16,426 --> 01:51:18,220
All we want to do is talk to her.

1293
01:51:19,012 --> 01:51:22,057
I'm very sorry,
but Maria is in seclusion.

1294
01:51:22,099 --> 01:51:25,394
-She hasn't been seeing anyone.
-She'll see us.

1295
01:51:25,435 --> 01:51:27,938
I want to show her my finger.

1296
01:51:28,188 --> 01:51:30,023
Some other time, dear.

1297
01:51:30,357 --> 01:51:31,650
I'll tell her you were here.

1298
01:51:31,692 --> 01:51:34,778
-It was sweet of you to call.
-We have to speak to her!

1299
01:51:36,113 --> 01:51:38,907
Run along, children.
Run along home.

1300
01:51:38,949 --> 01:51:40,826
I'm sure she'd like to see us.

1301
01:51:40,868 --> 01:51:43,245
Sister Margaretta, please.

1302
01:51:43,287 --> 01:51:47,082
-Goodbye, children.
-Sister Margaretta, may we, please?

1303
01:51:49,877 --> 01:51:51,753
What was that about, Sister?

1304
01:51:51,795 --> 01:51:53,964
The von Trapp children,
Reverend Mother.

1305
01:51:54,256 --> 01:51:56,717
They want to see Maria.

1306
01:51:56,967 --> 01:51:59,511
Has she spoken yet?
Has she told you anything?

1307
01:51:59,553 --> 01:52:03,557
She doesn't say a word,
Reverend Mother, except in prayer.

1308
01:52:03,807 --> 01:52:04,933
Poor child.

1309
01:52:04,975 --> 01:52:08,187
It's strange.
She seems happy to be back here,

1310
01:52:08,228 --> 01:52:11,481
and yet she's unhappy, too.

1311
01:52:12,649 --> 01:52:15,777
Perhaps I have been wrong
in leaving her alone so long.

1312
01:52:16,069 --> 01:52:18,739
Bring her to me,
even if she's not yet ready.

1313
01:52:18,989 --> 01:52:20,657
Yes, Reverend Mother.

1314
01:52:26,163 --> 01:52:29,666
Sister Augusta, take our new postulant
to the robing room.

1315
01:52:30,667 --> 01:52:32,961
God bless you, my daughter.

1316
01:52:39,176 --> 01:52:40,844
Yes, bring her in.

1317
01:52:49,937 --> 01:52:52,147
You've been unhappy. I'm sorry.

1318
01:52:54,191 --> 01:52:55,359
Reverend Mother.

1319
01:52:55,776 --> 01:52:58,362
Why did they send you back to us?

1320
01:52:59,196 --> 01:53:01,198
They didn't send me back. I left.

1321
01:53:03,700 --> 01:53:05,285
Sit down, Maria.

1322
01:53:05,786 --> 01:53:07,538
Tell me what happened.

1323
01:53:12,626 --> 01:53:14,002
I was frightened.

1324
01:53:14,336 --> 01:53:19,007
-Frightened? Were they unkind to you?
-Oh, no!

1325
01:53:19,049 --> 01:53:22,803
No, I was confused. I felt...

1326
01:53:24,221 --> 01:53:26,515
I've never felt that way before.

1327
01:53:26,557 --> 01:53:30,519
I couldn't stay. I knew that here
I'd be away from it. I'd be safe.

1328
01:53:30,561 --> 01:53:34,731
Maria, our abbey is not to be used
as an escape.

1329
01:53:35,566 --> 01:53:37,818
What is it you can't face?

1330
01:53:39,736 --> 01:53:41,196
I can't face him again.

1331
01:53:42,030 --> 01:53:43,532
Him?

1332
01:53:45,158 --> 01:53:47,202
Thank you, Sister Margaretta.

1333
01:53:56,753 --> 01:53:58,422
Captain von Trapp?

1334
01:54:03,886 --> 01:54:06,597
-Are you in love with him?
-I don't know!

1335
01:54:06,847 --> 01:54:08,265
I don't know. I...

1336
01:54:08,849 --> 01:54:12,895
The Baroness said I was.
She said that he was in love with me.

1337
01:54:12,936 --> 01:54:15,564
But I didn't want to believe it.

1338
01:54:16,690 --> 01:54:18,942
There were times we looked
at each other.

1339
01:54:19,193 --> 01:54:20,736
I could hardly breathe.

1340
01:54:21,069 --> 01:54:23,780
-Did you let him see your feelings?
-I don't know.

1341
01:54:24,406 --> 01:54:27,242
That's what's torturing me.
I was on God's errand.

1342
01:54:27,284 --> 01:54:31,872
To have asked for his love would have
been wrong. I just couldn't stay.

1343
01:54:34,416 --> 01:54:37,252
I'm ready at this moment
to take my vows.

1344
01:54:38,128 --> 01:54:41,215
-Please help me.
-Maria.

1345
01:54:42,758 --> 01:54:47,471
The love of a man and a woman is holy.
You have a great capacity to love.

1346
01:54:47,721 --> 01:54:50,641
You must find out how God
wants you to spend your love.

1347
01:54:50,891 --> 01:54:54,937
But I pledged my life to God.
I pledged my life to his service.

1348
01:54:54,978 --> 01:54:59,316
My daughter, if you love this man,
it doesn't mean you love God less.

1349
01:55:00,984 --> 01:55:03,070
No.

1350
01:55:03,111 --> 01:55:04,988
You must find out.

1351
01:55:06,740 --> 01:55:09,243
You must go back.

1352
01:55:09,493 --> 01:55:13,038
You can't ask me to do that.
Please let me stay. I beg...

1353
01:55:14,456 --> 01:55:18,085
These walls were not built
to shut out problems.

1354
01:55:18,502 --> 01:55:20,128
You have to face them.

1355
01:55:20,671 --> 01:55:23,966
You have to live the life
you were born to live.

1356
01:55:29,805 --> 01:55:33,517
Climb every mountain

1357
01:55:34,351 --> 01:55:37,688
Search high and low

1358
01:55:38,772 --> 01:55:42,860
Follow every byway

1359
01:55:43,360 --> 01:55:47,531
Every path you know

1360
01:55:48,115 --> 01:55:52,202
Climb every mountain

1361
01:55:52,828 --> 01:55:56,665
Ford every stream

1362
01:55:57,374 --> 01:56:01,795
Follow every rainbow

1363
01:56:02,045 --> 01:56:05,883
Till you find your dream

1364
01:56:06,550 --> 01:56:09,845
A dream that will need

1365
01:56:09,887 --> 01:56:14,016
All the love you can give

1366
01:56:15,517 --> 01:56:18,562
Every day of your life

1367
01:56:19,188 --> 01:56:25,569
For as long as you live

1368
01:56:25,903 --> 01:56:30,073
Climb every mountain

1369
01:56:30,407 --> 01:56:34,745
Ford every stream

1370
01:56:35,037 --> 01:56:39,583
Follow every rainbow

1371
01:56:39,833 --> 01:56:44,922
Till you find your dream

1372
01:56:49,343 --> 01:56:52,846
A dream that will need

1373
01:56:53,096 --> 01:56:58,101
All the love you can give

1374
01:56:58,936 --> 01:57:02,231
Every day of your life

1375
01:57:02,606 --> 01:57:08,946
For as long as you live

1376
01:57:09,363 --> 01:57:13,617
Climb every mountain

1377
01:57:14,034 --> 01:57:17,955
Ford every stream

1378
01:57:18,622 --> 01:57:23,085
Follow every rainbow

1379
01:57:23,627 --> 01:57:27,714
Till you find

1380
01:57:27,965 --> 01:57:34,972
Your dream

1381
01:57:40,477 --> 01:57:43,981
Now, it's not like my children
to be secretive.

1382
01:57:44,231 --> 01:57:46,316
We're not being secretive, Father.

1383
01:57:47,985 --> 01:57:51,321
And it's not like my children
to be late for dinner.

1384
01:57:51,613 --> 01:57:55,075
-We lost track of the time.
-I see.

1385
01:57:55,826 --> 01:57:59,454
Who's going to be the first one
to tell me the truth? Friedrich.

1386
01:57:59,496 --> 01:58:01,748
Brigitta. Liesl.

1387
01:58:02,958 --> 01:58:05,169
Where do you think we were, Father?

1388
01:58:11,800 --> 01:58:16,513
If you don't believe us, you must have
some idea of where you think we were.

1389
01:58:19,349 --> 01:58:21,310
-Marta.
-Yes, Father.

1390
01:58:21,351 --> 01:58:22,603
You tell me.

1391
01:58:23,854 --> 01:58:27,524
Friedrich told you, Father.
We were berry picking.

1392
01:58:28,358 --> 01:58:33,030
-I forgot! You were berry picking.
-Yes, we love berry picking.

1393
01:58:33,363 --> 01:58:34,656
All afternoon?

1394
01:58:34,698 --> 01:58:36,617
-We picked thousands.
-Thousands?

1395
01:58:36,658 --> 01:58:39,536
-They were all over the place.
-What kind of berries?

1396
01:58:39,828 --> 01:58:43,123
-Blueberries, sir.
-Blueberries.

1397
01:58:45,042 --> 01:58:48,378
It's too early for blueberries.

1398
01:58:49,880 --> 01:58:51,965
-They were strawberries.
-Strawberries?

1399
01:58:52,716 --> 01:58:55,385
It's been so cold lately,
they turned blue.

1400
01:59:01,225 --> 01:59:03,393
Very well. Show me the berries.

1401
01:59:04,645 --> 01:59:06,021
-We...
-Well...

1402
01:59:06,063 --> 01:59:08,774
-Show me the berries you picked.
-We don't have them.

1403
01:59:09,149 --> 01:59:11,610
You don't have them?
What happened to them?

1404
01:59:11,652 --> 01:59:14,363
-We...
-We ate them.

1405
01:59:14,404 --> 01:59:17,366
-You ate them? All of them?
-Yes!

1406
01:59:17,407 --> 01:59:18,867
-They were so good.
-Delicious.

1407
01:59:18,909 --> 01:59:20,494
Very well.

1408
01:59:20,744 --> 01:59:26,041
Since you've obviously stuffed
yourselves on thousands of berries

1409
01:59:26,083 --> 01:59:30,212
you can't be hungry anymore,
so I'll have to tell Frau Schmidt

1410
01:59:30,254 --> 01:59:33,173
to skip your dinner.

1411
01:59:42,349 --> 01:59:45,227
It's your fault.
We should have told him the truth.

1412
01:59:45,269 --> 01:59:47,271
And made him boiling mad at us?

1413
01:59:47,563 --> 01:59:49,439
It's better than starving to death.

1414
01:59:49,731 --> 01:59:52,568
We didn't do anything wrong.
We just wanted to see her.

1415
01:59:53,902 --> 01:59:57,030
My stomach's making noises.

1416
01:59:57,447 --> 02:00:00,284
The least they could have done
was to let us say hello.

1417
02:00:01,410 --> 02:00:04,955
-I wonder what grass tastes like.
-I feel awful.

1418
02:00:05,539 --> 02:00:09,751
When Fräulein Maria wanted to feel
better she used to sing that song.

1419
02:00:10,627 --> 02:00:12,254
Let's try it.

1420
02:00:12,296 --> 02:00:14,965
Raindrops on roses

1421
02:00:15,257 --> 02:00:18,468
And whiskers on kittens

1422
02:00:20,137 --> 02:00:22,723
Bright copper kettles

1423
02:00:22,973 --> 02:00:25,976
And warm woolen mittens

1424
02:00:27,394 --> 02:00:32,900
Brown paper packages
Tied up with strings

1425
02:00:33,609 --> 02:00:38,739
These are a few of my favorite things

1426
02:00:39,823 --> 02:00:41,909
Why don't I feel better?

1427
02:00:43,076 --> 02:00:45,579
Girls in white dresses

1428
02:00:45,621 --> 02:00:48,624
With blue satin sashes

1429
02:00:48,957 --> 02:00:54,963
Snowflakes that stay
On my nose and eyelashes

1430
02:00:55,005 --> 02:00:57,049
Silver white winters...

1431
02:00:57,090 --> 02:00:58,133
Fräulein Maria's back!

1432
02:00:58,175 --> 02:01:00,052
That melt into springs

1433
02:01:00,093 --> 02:01:03,472
These are a few of my favorite things

1434
02:01:03,514 --> 02:01:06,642
When the dog bites
When the bee stings

1435
02:01:06,683 --> 02:01:09,436
When I'm feeling sad

1436
02:01:09,478 --> 02:01:12,648
I simply remember my favorite things

1437
02:01:12,689 --> 02:01:15,150
And then I don't feel

1438
02:01:15,192 --> 02:01:21,782
So bad

1439
02:01:23,033 --> 02:01:25,410
-I'm so glad to see you.
-We missed you.

1440
02:01:25,452 --> 02:01:26,745
I missed you.

1441
02:01:26,787 --> 02:01:29,248
-Kurt, how are you?
-Hungry.

1442
02:01:30,457 --> 02:01:33,293
-What happened to your finger?
-It got caught.

1443
02:01:33,335 --> 02:01:35,504
-Caught in what?
-Friedrich's teeth.

1444
02:01:36,713 --> 02:01:38,882
-Liesl, you all right?
-Just fair.

1445
02:01:39,132 --> 02:01:42,052
-Any telegrams been delivered lately?
-None at all.

1446
02:01:42,344 --> 02:01:45,806
But I'm learning to accept it.
I'll be glad when school begins.

1447
02:01:46,056 --> 02:01:50,686
Liesl, you can't use school to escape
your problems. You have to face them.

1448
02:01:51,019 --> 02:01:52,521
I have so much to tell you.

1449
02:01:52,563 --> 02:01:54,940
-We have things to tell you, too.
-I'm sure.

1450
02:01:54,982 --> 02:01:58,652
The most important thing is
that Father is going to be married.

1451
02:01:58,902 --> 02:02:00,195
Married?

1452
02:02:00,237 --> 02:02:02,406
Yes, to Baroness Schraeder.

1453
02:02:10,205 --> 02:02:11,748
Oh, I see.

1454
02:02:13,584 --> 02:02:16,879
Father, look!
Fräulein Maria's back!

1455
02:02:16,920 --> 02:02:19,256
Fräulein Maria's back from the abbey.

1456
02:02:21,425 --> 02:02:22,551
Good evening, Captain.

1457
02:02:24,052 --> 02:02:25,345
Good evening.

1458
02:02:27,848 --> 02:02:29,892
Everyone inside for dinner.

1459
02:02:29,933 --> 02:02:31,602
Dinner!

1460
02:02:40,944 --> 02:02:45,616
You left without saying goodbye.
Even to the children.

1461
02:02:46,617 --> 02:02:49,203
It was wrong of me. Forgive me.

1462
02:02:50,120 --> 02:02:51,580
Why did you?

1463
02:02:51,622 --> 02:02:54,458
Please don't ask me.
The reason no longer exists.

1464
02:02:55,626 --> 02:02:58,712
Fräulein Maria, you've returned.

1465
02:02:59,922 --> 02:03:01,757
Isn't it wonderful, Georg?

1466
02:03:05,052 --> 02:03:07,429
I wish you every happiness, Baroness.

1467
02:03:07,471 --> 02:03:10,432
You, too, Captain.
The children say you're to marry.

1468
02:03:10,474 --> 02:03:12,142
Thank you, my dear.

1469
02:03:14,144 --> 02:03:17,648
You are back to stay?

1470
02:03:19,775 --> 02:03:23,111
Only until arrangements can be made
for another governess.

1471
02:04:18,876 --> 02:04:20,502
There you are.

1472
02:04:34,808 --> 02:04:37,352
I must speak to cook
about the schnitzel.

1473
02:04:37,394 --> 02:04:40,314
It is entirely too delicious for my figure.

1474
02:04:41,273 --> 02:04:44,526
And it makes you much too quiet
at the dinner table.

1475
02:04:44,568 --> 02:04:46,278
Or was it the wine?

1476
02:04:46,820 --> 02:04:48,614
Undoubtedly the wine.

1477
02:04:51,366 --> 02:04:53,869
You have no idea
the trouble I'm having

1478
02:04:53,911 --> 02:04:56,747
trying to decide on
a wedding present for you.

1479
02:04:56,788 --> 02:04:58,707
Oh, I know. I'm enough.

1480
02:04:59,124 --> 02:05:02,961
But I do want you to have
some little trifle for the occasion.

1481
02:05:03,212 --> 02:05:05,631
At first I thought
of a fountain pen

1482
02:05:05,672 --> 02:05:07,925
but you've already got one.

1483
02:05:08,175 --> 02:05:11,386
Then I thought perhaps a villa
in the south of France

1484
02:05:11,428 --> 02:05:14,014
but they are so difficult to gift-wrap.

1485
02:05:14,056 --> 02:05:16,808
Oh, Georg, how do you feel about yachts?

1486
02:05:17,100 --> 02:05:19,269
A long, sleek one
for the Mediterranean

1487
02:05:19,311 --> 02:05:21,939
or a tiny one
for your bathtub, huh?

1488
02:05:24,399 --> 02:05:26,777
-Elsa.
-Where to go on our honeymoon?

1489
02:05:26,818 --> 02:05:29,154
Now, that's a real problem.

1490
02:05:29,196 --> 02:05:32,157
A trip around the world
would be lovely. And then I said,

1491
02:05:32,199 --> 02:05:34,660
"Oh, Elsa, there must be
someplace better to go."

1492
02:05:34,701 --> 02:05:37,454
-But don't worry, darling, I'll...
-Elsa.

1493
02:05:38,455 --> 02:05:39,831
Yes, Georg.

1494
02:05:40,499 --> 02:05:42,000
It's no use,

1495
02:05:43,168 --> 02:05:44,628
you and I.

1496
02:05:46,129 --> 02:05:48,674
I'm being dishonest to both of us

1497
02:05:50,717 --> 02:05:52,928
and utterly unfair to you.

1498
02:05:57,558 --> 02:06:00,686
-When two people talk of marriage...
-No, don't.

1499
02:06:01,311 --> 02:06:03,605
Don't say another word, please.

1500
02:06:06,608 --> 02:06:10,863
You see, there are other things
I've been thinking of.

1501
02:06:12,781 --> 02:06:17,035
Fond as I am of you, I really don't
think you're the right man for me.

1502
02:06:17,494 --> 02:06:21,498
You're much too independent.

1503
02:06:22,541 --> 02:06:26,420
And I need someone
who needs me desperately

1504
02:06:27,671 --> 02:06:30,299
or at least needs
my money desperately.

1505
02:06:32,968 --> 02:06:37,389
I've enjoyed every moment we've had
together and I do thank you for that.

1506
02:06:40,517 --> 02:06:42,644
Now, if you'll forgive me

1507
02:06:42,686 --> 02:06:44,938
I'll go inside, pack my little bags

1508
02:06:44,980 --> 02:06:47,524
and return to Vienna where I belong.

1509
02:06:52,696 --> 02:06:54,740
And somewhere out there

1510
02:06:55,032 --> 02:06:57,201
is a young lady who, I think

1511
02:06:59,703 --> 02:07:01,455
will never be a nun.

1512
02:07:12,883 --> 02:07:14,885
Auf Wiedersehen, darling.

1513
02:07:41,078 --> 02:07:42,246
Hello.

1514
02:07:48,001 --> 02:07:51,338
I thought I just might find you here.

1515
02:07:56,093 --> 02:07:58,387
Was there something you wanted?

1516
02:07:58,762 --> 02:08:00,931
No, no, no. Sit down, please.

1517
02:08:02,516 --> 02:08:03,725
Please.

1518
02:08:08,939 --> 02:08:10,107
May I?

1519
02:08:22,744 --> 02:08:26,623
You know, I was thinking
and I was wondering two things.

1520
02:08:28,542 --> 02:08:31,795
Why did you run away to the abbey?

1521
02:08:33,630 --> 02:08:37,885
And what was it
that made you come back?

1522
02:08:39,803 --> 02:08:42,556
Well, I had an obligation to fulfill

1523
02:08:42,598 --> 02:08:45,934
and I came back to fulfill it.

1524
02:08:47,311 --> 02:08:48,729
Is that all?

1525
02:08:49,980 --> 02:08:52,024
And I missed the children.

1526
02:08:52,691 --> 02:08:53,775
Yes.

1527
02:08:55,027 --> 02:08:57,654
-Only the children?
-No. Yes.

1528
02:08:58,363 --> 02:09:02,159
-Isn't it right that I missed them?
-Oh, yes. Yes, of course.

1529
02:09:02,409 --> 02:09:05,037
I was only hoping that perhaps you...

1530
02:09:05,871 --> 02:09:07,664
Perhaps you might...

1531
02:09:09,583 --> 02:09:10,667
Yes?

1532
02:09:12,586 --> 02:09:16,882
Well, nothing was the same
when you were away

1533
02:09:16,924 --> 02:09:21,845
and it'll be all wrong again after you leave

1534
02:09:22,137 --> 02:09:26,975
and I just thought perhaps
you might change your mind.

1535
02:09:30,521 --> 02:09:34,775
Well, I'm sure the Baroness will be
able to make things fine for you.

1536
02:09:35,400 --> 02:09:36,568
Maria.

1537
02:09:38,862 --> 02:09:42,157
-There isn't going to be any baroness.
-There isn't?

1538
02:09:44,701 --> 02:09:45,702
No.

1539
02:09:46,411 --> 02:09:48,163
I don't understand.

1540
02:09:50,541 --> 02:09:54,461
Well, we've called off our engagement,
you see, and...

1541
02:09:54,878 --> 02:09:57,464
-Oh, I'm sorry.
-Yes. You are?

1542
02:09:59,383 --> 02:10:00,884
-You did?
-Yes.

1543
02:10:02,845 --> 02:10:06,640
Well, you can't marry someone
when you're

1544
02:10:09,893 --> 02:10:11,979
in love with someone else.

1545
02:10:15,315 --> 02:10:16,567
Can you?

1546
02:10:52,060 --> 02:10:54,354
The Reverend Mother always says,

1547
02:10:54,396 --> 02:10:58,108
"When the Lord closes a door,
somewhere he opens a window."

1548
02:11:05,908 --> 02:11:08,619
What else does the Reverend Mother say?

1549
02:11:09,828 --> 02:11:12,372
That you have to look for your life.

1550
02:11:13,957 --> 02:11:16,001
Is that why you came back?

1551
02:11:20,547 --> 02:11:22,508
And have you found it,

1552
02:11:22,841 --> 02:11:24,134
Maria?

1553
02:11:25,969 --> 02:11:27,471
I think I have.

1554
02:11:30,849 --> 02:11:31,975
I know I have.

1555
02:11:34,520 --> 02:11:35,896
I love you.

1556
02:11:40,484 --> 02:11:42,819
Oh, can this be happening to me?

1557
02:11:45,656 --> 02:11:50,661
Perhaps I had a wicked childhood

1558
02:11:52,246 --> 02:11:57,960
Perhaps I had a miserable youth

1559
02:11:59,086 --> 02:12:06,009
But somewhere
In my wicked, miserable past

1560
02:12:06,051 --> 02:12:11,682
There must have been a moment of truth

1561
02:12:12,808 --> 02:12:19,606
For here you are
Standing there loving me

1562
02:12:20,190 --> 02:12:26,530
Whether or not you should

1563
02:12:26,989 --> 02:12:33,954
So somewhere in my youth or childhood

1564
02:12:34,538 --> 02:12:41,503
I must have done something good

1565
02:12:43,380 --> 02:12:47,509
Nothing comes from nothing

1566
02:12:47,551 --> 02:12:52,181
Nothing ever could

1567
02:12:52,222 --> 02:12:59,229
So somewhere in my youth or childhood

1568
02:13:02,733 --> 02:13:09,740
I must have done something good

1569
02:13:12,910 --> 02:13:17,581
Do you know when I first
started loving you?

1570
02:13:18,373 --> 02:13:22,377
That night at dinner, when you sat
on that ridiculous pine cone.

1571
02:13:22,419 --> 02:13:23,545
What?

1572
02:13:25,088 --> 02:13:28,300
I knew the first time you blew
that silly whistle.

1573
02:13:29,510 --> 02:13:30,928
Oh, my love.

1574
02:13:35,390 --> 02:13:42,356
For here you are
Standing there loving me

1575
02:13:45,150 --> 02:13:50,781
Whether or not you should

1576
02:13:52,324 --> 02:13:59,289
So somewhere in my youth or childhood

1577
02:14:00,165 --> 02:14:07,130
I must have done something good

1578
02:14:09,132 --> 02:14:12,928
Nothing comes from nothing

1579
02:14:12,970 --> 02:14:16,640
Nothing ever could

1580
02:14:16,682 --> 02:14:22,479
So somewhere in my youth

1581
02:14:22,521 --> 02:14:25,482
Or childhood

1582
02:14:28,026 --> 02:14:34,908
I must have done something

1583
02:14:38,662 --> 02:14:45,669
Something good

1584
02:14:55,804 --> 02:14:56,972
Maria.

1585
02:14:59,266 --> 02:15:03,187
Is there anyone I should go to,
to ask permission to marry you?

1586
02:15:08,025 --> 02:15:10,110
-Why don't we ask...
-The children?

1587
02:16:58,802 --> 02:17:03,473
How do you solve a problem like Maria?

1588
02:17:03,514 --> 02:17:08,270
How do you catch a cloud
And pin it down?

1589
02:17:08,312 --> 02:17:12,816
How do you find a word
That means Maria?

1590
02:17:12,858 --> 02:17:14,066
A flibbertigibbet

1591
02:17:14,109 --> 02:17:17,696
A will-o'-the-wisp
A clown

1592
02:17:17,737 --> 02:17:22,492
Many a thing you know
You'd like to tell her

1593
02:17:22,534 --> 02:17:27,080
Many a thing she ought to understand

1594
02:17:27,121 --> 02:17:32,044
But how do you make her stay
And listen to all you say?

1595
02:17:32,084 --> 02:17:36,215
How do you keep a wave
Upon the sand?

1596
02:17:36,255 --> 02:17:41,553
Oh, how do you solve
A problem like Maria?

1597
02:17:41,594 --> 02:17:48,519
How do you hold a moonbeam
In your hand?

1598
02:19:54,311 --> 02:19:55,854
Herr Detweiler!

1599
02:19:58,649 --> 02:20:01,527
-Heil Hitler.
-Oh, good afternoon, Herr Zeller.

1600
02:20:01,568 --> 02:20:04,738
Perhaps you've not heard.
I am now the Gauleiter.

1601
02:20:05,030 --> 02:20:06,448
Heil Hitler.

1602
02:20:07,491 --> 02:20:08,867
Heil Hitler.

1603
02:20:08,909 --> 02:20:11,703
I've come from
Captain von Trapp's house.

1604
02:20:11,745 --> 02:20:15,499
The only one in the area
not flying the Third Reich flag

1605
02:20:15,541 --> 02:20:16,959
since the Anschluss.

1606
02:20:17,000 --> 02:20:19,336
-But we have dealt with that.
-I don't...

1607
02:20:19,378 --> 02:20:22,005
The housekeeper told me
that I would find you here.

1608
02:20:22,673 --> 02:20:24,842
The only thing she'd tell me.

1609
02:20:24,883 --> 02:20:27,511
What kind of information
are you looking for?

1610
02:20:27,553 --> 02:20:29,972
When will the Captain return?

1611
02:20:30,013 --> 02:20:34,101
Well, he's on his honeymoon trip.
He's not been in touch with us.

1612
02:20:34,142 --> 02:20:39,189
Am I to believe he hasn't communicated
with his children in over a month?

1613
02:20:39,231 --> 02:20:41,358
How many men do you know

1614
02:20:41,400 --> 02:20:44,987
who communicate with their children
while honeymooning?

1615
02:20:45,571 --> 02:20:49,783
Upon his return, he'll fill
his proper position in the new order.

1616
02:20:49,825 --> 02:20:52,244
Naturally. And may I congratulate you

1617
02:20:52,286 --> 02:20:57,249
and your people in allowing the
festival to go on tonight as planned.

1618
02:20:57,291 --> 02:21:01,170
Why should it not go on?
Nothing in Austria has changed.

1619
02:21:01,211 --> 02:21:04,673
Singing and music will
show this to the world.

1620
02:21:04,715 --> 02:21:06,633
Austria is the same.

1621
02:21:07,217 --> 02:21:08,802
Heil Hitler.

1622
02:21:10,846 --> 02:21:12,389
Heil Hitler.

1623
02:21:14,183 --> 02:21:15,559
Come, let's go home.

1624
02:21:15,601 --> 02:21:19,313
-Why was he so cross?
-Everybody's cross these days.

1625
02:21:19,354 --> 02:21:22,816
Maybe the flag with the black spider
makes people nervous.

1626
02:21:22,858 --> 02:21:26,069
-Will Father be in trouble?
-He doesn't have to be.

1627
02:21:26,111 --> 02:21:28,989
The thing to do
is to get along with everybody.

1628
02:21:29,031 --> 02:21:31,366
Remember that tonight at the concert.

1629
02:21:31,408 --> 02:21:34,536
Are we really going to sing
before a lot of people?

1630
02:21:34,578 --> 02:21:36,872
Look. The von Trapp Family Singers.

1631
02:21:36,914 --> 02:21:41,585
Liesl, Friedrich, Louisa, Brigitta,
Kurt, Marta and Gretl.

1632
02:21:41,627 --> 02:21:46,006
-Why am I always last?
-Because you are the most important.

1633
02:21:46,673 --> 02:21:48,258
There we go.

1634
02:21:54,306 --> 02:21:57,851
Are you sure Father will approve
of our singing in public?

1635
02:21:57,893 --> 02:22:00,145
He'll be pleased and proud.

1636
02:22:00,771 --> 02:22:03,315
-Liesl, do you think so?
-Don't you trust me?

1637
02:22:03,357 --> 02:22:04,566
No.

1638
02:22:04,608 --> 02:22:07,194
You're a very intelligent girl.

1639
02:22:07,236 --> 02:22:09,446
Liesl. Liesl!

1640
02:22:10,322 --> 02:22:11,532
Rolfe!

1641
02:22:12,574 --> 02:22:14,743
I'm so glad to see you. It's been...

1642
02:22:14,785 --> 02:22:16,245
Good afternoon.

1643
02:22:16,286 --> 02:22:19,873
Give this to your father
as soon as he's home.

1644
02:22:19,915 --> 02:22:21,917
-He's on his honeymoon.
-I know.

1645
02:22:21,959 --> 02:22:25,921
-You do?
-We make it our business to know all.

1646
02:22:25,963 --> 02:22:28,757
-Who's "we"?
-See that he gets it.

1647
02:22:28,799 --> 02:22:31,718
-What is it?
-It's a telegram from Berlin.

1648
02:22:31,969 --> 02:22:34,930
Don't you want to deliver it yourself?

1649
02:22:34,972 --> 02:22:37,683
I'm occupied with more important matters.

1650
02:22:37,724 --> 02:22:40,394
And your father had better be, too.

1651
02:22:40,435 --> 02:22:41,979
But, Rolfe!

1652
02:23:05,043 --> 02:23:06,378
Father!

1653
02:23:07,004 --> 02:23:09,923
-We didn't expect you so soon.
-Hello, hello!

1654
02:23:09,965 --> 02:23:12,926
We didn't expect you home
until next week!

1655
02:23:12,968 --> 02:23:18,390
-Did you bring souvenirs from Paris?
-Hello! How are you?

1656
02:23:19,600 --> 02:23:20,934
Why didn't you call us?

1657
02:23:20,976 --> 02:23:23,103
We couldn't get through.

1658
02:23:23,145 --> 02:23:25,355
I had nothing to do with that.

1659
02:23:25,397 --> 02:23:27,691
We came back as fast as we could.

1660
02:23:27,733 --> 02:23:30,319
Well, well, well! We missed you!

1661
02:23:30,360 --> 02:23:32,738
-We missed you!
-We missed kissing you.

1662
02:23:32,779 --> 02:23:35,741
We missed all the noise in the morning.

1663
02:23:35,782 --> 02:23:40,329
-Mostly, we missed hearing you sing.
-Oh, you came back just in time.

1664
02:23:40,370 --> 02:23:42,206
Look, Fräulein Maria...

1665
02:23:42,247 --> 02:23:43,832
I mean, Mother.

1666
02:23:44,374 --> 02:23:47,002
-We're going to sing in the festival tonight.
-What?

1667
02:23:47,044 --> 02:23:49,296
We've been having a lovely time!

1668
02:23:49,338 --> 02:23:51,548
We've been rehearsing all...

1669
02:23:53,050 --> 02:23:55,385
Surprise! Surprise!

1670
02:23:56,053 --> 02:23:58,514
Surprises for you on the terrace.

1671
02:24:01,475 --> 02:24:03,060
We'll talk about this.

1672
02:24:03,101 --> 02:24:07,606
I would've told you but you were away.
I had to make a last-minute decision.

1673
02:24:07,648 --> 02:24:10,400
I was fortunate to enter them at all.

1674
02:24:10,442 --> 02:24:15,280
They'll be the talk of the festival.
Imagine, seven children in one family!

1675
02:24:15,322 --> 02:24:16,823
Max!

1676
02:24:17,658 --> 02:24:20,577
Somehow I recall having made it
quite clear to you

1677
02:24:20,619 --> 02:24:23,622
how I feel about
my family singing in public!

1678
02:24:23,664 --> 02:24:25,666
The committee was enchanted.

1679
02:24:25,707 --> 02:24:28,961
-What did they say?
-I have never heard such enthusiasm.

1680
02:24:29,002 --> 02:24:33,507
-Don't you think just this once...
-Absolutely out of the question.

1681
02:24:33,549 --> 02:24:37,177
-Georg, this is for Austria.
-For Austria?

1682
02:24:38,136 --> 02:24:41,390
-There is no Austria!
-But the Anschluss was peaceful.

1683
02:24:41,431 --> 02:24:44,935
-Let's at least be grateful for that.
-Grateful?

1684
02:24:46,812 --> 02:24:48,438
You know, Max,

1685
02:24:49,439 --> 02:24:52,860
sometimes I don't believe I know you.

1686
02:24:55,279 --> 02:24:56,989
Father, I forgot.

1687
02:24:57,531 --> 02:24:59,283
This is for you.

1688
02:25:09,001 --> 02:25:13,172
Maria, he has got to at least pretend
to work with these people.

1689
02:25:13,213 --> 02:25:14,923
You must convince him.

1690
02:25:14,965 --> 02:25:17,926
Max, I can't ask him to be less than he is.

1691
02:25:17,968 --> 02:25:21,513
Then I'll talk to him.
If the children don't sing, well,

1692
02:25:21,555 --> 02:25:24,141
it will be a reflection on Austria.

1693
02:25:24,600 --> 02:25:27,978
Oh, I know.
It wouldn't do me any good either.

1694
02:25:33,150 --> 02:25:35,944
Mother? That sounds so nice.

1695
02:25:35,986 --> 02:25:38,989
-I like calling you "Mother."
-I like hearing it.

1696
02:25:39,031 --> 02:25:42,784
You love Father very much.
I can tell you do.

1697
02:25:42,826 --> 02:25:43,911
Very much.

1698
02:25:43,952 --> 02:25:47,497
Mother, what do you do
when you think you love someone?

1699
02:25:47,956 --> 02:25:53,253
I mean, when you stop loving someone
or he stops loving you?

1700
02:25:55,839 --> 02:25:57,925
Well, you cry a little.

1701
02:25:58,467 --> 02:26:00,802
Then you wait for the sun to come out.

1702
02:26:00,844 --> 02:26:02,346
It always does.

1703
02:26:02,387 --> 02:26:06,225
There are so many things I think
I should know but I don't.

1704
02:26:06,266 --> 02:26:08,018
-I really don't.
-How can you?

1705
02:26:08,519 --> 02:26:12,981
-Sometimes I feel the world is ending.
-Then you feel it's just beginning?

1706
02:26:13,023 --> 02:26:16,068
-Yes!
-It was that way with me.

1707
02:26:16,109 --> 02:26:20,781
-And for you it will be just as wonderful.
-Do you really think so?

1708
02:26:21,990 --> 02:26:26,245
When you're 16 going on 17

1709
02:26:26,286 --> 02:26:29,957
Waiting for life to start

1710
02:26:30,541 --> 02:26:34,503
Somebody kind
Who touches your mind

1711
02:26:34,545 --> 02:26:39,174
Will suddenly touch your heart

1712
02:26:39,216 --> 02:26:41,426
When that happens

1713
02:26:41,468 --> 02:26:43,554
After it happens

1714
02:26:43,595 --> 02:26:46,974
Nothing is quite the same

1715
02:26:47,766 --> 02:26:49,560
Somehow I know

1716
02:26:49,601 --> 02:26:51,854
I'll jump up and go

1717
02:26:51,895 --> 02:26:55,899
If ever he calls my name

1718
02:26:56,483 --> 02:27:00,612
Gone are your old ideas of life

1719
02:27:00,654 --> 02:27:04,533
The old ideas grow dim

1720
02:27:05,033 --> 02:27:09,413
Lo and behold
You're someone's wife

1721
02:27:10,414 --> 02:27:16,253
And you belong to him

1722
02:27:16,712 --> 02:27:21,216
You may think this kind of adventure

1723
02:27:21,258 --> 02:27:25,596
Never may come to you

1724
02:27:26,180 --> 02:27:31,226
Darling, 16 going on 17

1725
02:27:32,436 --> 02:27:37,065
Wait a year...

1726
02:27:37,107 --> 02:27:42,404
-I'll wait a year
-...or two

1727
02:27:43,071 --> 02:27:49,786
Just wait a year

1728
02:27:51,246 --> 02:27:57,961
Or two

1729
02:28:20,275 --> 02:28:21,777
What is it?

1730
02:28:22,528 --> 02:28:23,946
Berlin.

1731
02:28:24,446 --> 02:28:26,281
They've offered me a commission.

1732
02:28:26,323 --> 02:28:29,326
I've been requested to accept immediately

1733
02:28:29,368 --> 02:28:33,372
and report to their naval base
at Bremerhaven tomorrow.

1734
02:28:33,997 --> 02:28:38,126
I knew this would happen.
I didn't think it would be so soon.

1735
02:28:38,168 --> 02:28:41,713
To refuse them would be fatal
for all of us.

1736
02:28:42,840 --> 02:28:46,635
And joining them would be unthinkable.

1737
02:28:52,683 --> 02:28:54,893
Get the children all together.

1738
02:28:54,935 --> 02:28:58,438
Don't say anything to worry them.
Just get them ready.

1739
02:28:59,147 --> 02:29:01,567
We've got to get out of Austria

1740
02:29:03,193 --> 02:29:04,903
and this house

1741
02:29:07,239 --> 02:29:08,657
tonight.

1742
02:29:52,618 --> 02:29:54,912
It strains my back and breaks my heart

1743
02:29:54,953 --> 02:29:58,248
when I think of the children
missing the festival.

1744
02:29:58,290 --> 02:30:01,043
By your announcement,
we'll be over the border.

1745
02:30:01,084 --> 02:30:03,795
Do you appreciate
the sacrifice I'm making?

1746
02:30:03,837 --> 02:30:05,297
You have no choice.

1747
02:30:05,339 --> 02:30:08,175
I know. That's why I'm making it.

1748
02:30:09,009 --> 02:30:11,386
Why doesn't Father turn the motor on?

1749
02:30:11,428 --> 02:30:14,890
Because he doesn't want anyone
to hear us.

1750
02:30:18,268 --> 02:30:21,021
What will Frau Schmidt and Franz say?

1751
02:30:21,063 --> 02:30:24,733
They'll be able to answer honestly
they didn't know anything.

1752
02:30:24,775 --> 02:30:29,238
-Will we be coming back here?
-Someday, Liesl. I do hope someday.

1753
02:30:29,279 --> 02:30:34,201
Are Father and Uncle Max going to push
the car all the way to Switzerland?

1754
02:31:01,019 --> 02:31:03,605
Something wrong with your car, Captain?

1755
02:31:03,647 --> 02:31:06,066
Yes, we couldn't get it started.

1756
02:31:09,736 --> 02:31:10,988
Karl.

1757
02:31:12,948 --> 02:31:16,410
Fix Captain von Trapp's car
so that it will start.

1758
02:31:39,558 --> 02:31:41,393
Excellent, Karl.

1759
02:31:44,771 --> 02:31:48,317
I've not asked you
where you and your family are going.

1760
02:31:48,609 --> 02:31:50,569
Nor have you asked me why I'm here.

1761
02:31:50,611 --> 02:31:54,615
Apparently we both suffer
from a deplorable lack of curiosity.

1762
02:31:55,407 --> 02:31:58,160
You never answered the telegram

1763
02:31:58,202 --> 02:32:01,663
from the Admiral of the Navy
of the Third Reich.

1764
02:32:01,705 --> 02:32:04,333
I was under the impression, Herr Zeller,

1765
02:32:04,374 --> 02:32:07,920
that the contents of telegrams
in Austria are private!

1766
02:32:08,629 --> 02:32:12,174
At least, the Austria I know.

1767
02:32:13,300 --> 02:32:15,135
I have my orders

1768
02:32:15,177 --> 02:32:17,554
to take you to Bremerhaven tonight

1769
02:32:17,596 --> 02:32:20,349
where you will accept your commission.

1770
02:32:20,974 --> 02:32:26,396
I'm afraid that's going to be
quite impossible.

1771
02:32:26,980 --> 02:32:28,732
You see, we,

1772
02:32:29,274 --> 02:32:32,110
all of us, the entire family, will be

1773
02:32:33,237 --> 02:32:35,531
singing in the festival tonight.

1774
02:32:35,572 --> 02:32:38,033
As a matter of fact, we're going now.

1775
02:32:38,075 --> 02:32:40,994
We couldn't possibly let them down now.

1776
02:32:41,662 --> 02:32:44,873
-I just hope we're not too late.
-Yes.

1777
02:32:44,915 --> 02:32:48,085
You ask me to believe that you,
Captain von Trapp,

1778
02:32:48,126 --> 02:32:49,878
are singing in a concert?

1779
02:32:49,920 --> 02:32:54,383
Believe me, it will be a performance
beyond anything even I've dreamt of.

1780
02:32:54,424 --> 02:32:59,137
Like you, Herr Zeller,
I, too, am a man of hidden talents.

1781
02:32:59,763 --> 02:33:00,931
Yes.

1782
02:33:01,348 --> 02:33:03,267
Here, program.

1783
02:33:08,939 --> 02:33:11,400
It says only the names of the children.

1784
02:33:11,441 --> 02:33:14,987
It says the von Trapp Family Singers,

1785
02:33:15,028 --> 02:33:18,448
and I am the head of the von Trapp family,
am I not?

1786
02:33:20,367 --> 02:33:24,955
And these travel clothes
that you're all wearing?

1787
02:33:24,997 --> 02:33:26,832
Our costumes, naturally.

1788
02:33:26,874 --> 02:33:30,335
This night air is not good
for the children's voices.

1789
02:33:36,425 --> 02:33:39,970
Well, a slight delay in my orders
will not be serious.

1790
02:33:41,138 --> 02:33:42,639
Therefore,

1791
02:33:43,557 --> 02:33:45,142
you will sing.

1792
02:33:46,143 --> 02:33:47,936
You will all sing.

1793
02:33:48,478 --> 02:33:51,023
But only because that's what I want.

1794
02:33:51,815 --> 02:33:55,485
It will demonstrate that nothing
in Austria has changed.

1795
02:33:56,111 --> 02:33:58,614
And when you have finished singing,

1796
02:33:58,655 --> 02:34:02,117
you, Captain von Trapp,
will be taken to Bremerhaven.

1797
02:34:02,993 --> 02:34:05,954
Now, if you will all get into your car,

1798
02:34:05,996 --> 02:34:09,791
we will escort the von Trapp
Family Singers to the festival.

1799
02:34:10,667 --> 02:34:13,128
No escort will be necessary.

1800
02:34:13,170 --> 02:34:15,714
Necessary? A pleasure, Captain.

1801
02:34:16,590 --> 02:34:20,469
After all, we would not want you
to get lost in the crowds.

1802
02:34:21,678 --> 02:34:23,180
Would we?

1803
02:34:23,764 --> 02:34:24,932
No.

1804
02:34:41,198 --> 02:34:44,493
-Sew, a needle pulling thread
-A needle pulling thread

1805
02:34:44,535 --> 02:34:47,788
-La, a note to follow sew
-A note to follow sew

1806
02:34:47,829 --> 02:34:51,750
-Tea, a drink with jam and bread
-A drink with jam and bread

1807
02:34:51,792 --> 02:34:54,837
-A drink with jam and bread
-A drink with jam and bread

1808
02:34:54,878 --> 02:34:56,547
-Jam and bread
-With jam and bread

1809
02:34:56,588 --> 02:34:58,257
Tea with jam and bread

1810
02:34:58,298 --> 02:35:00,843
Tea with jam and bread
Jam and bread

1811
02:35:00,884 --> 02:35:04,137
Jam and bread
Tea with jam, jam and bread

1812
02:35:04,179 --> 02:35:07,558
Jam and bread
Tea with jam, jam and bread

1813
02:35:13,105 --> 02:35:16,525
-With jam
-A, B, C

1814
02:35:16,567 --> 02:35:20,279
-With jam
-Do-re-mi

1815
02:35:20,320 --> 02:35:23,866
Tea with jam and bread

1816
02:35:23,907 --> 02:35:25,534
With jam and bread

1817
02:35:25,576 --> 02:35:27,536
With jam
With jam

1818
02:35:27,578 --> 02:35:34,334
And bread

1819
02:35:58,108 --> 02:36:01,278
My fellow Austrians,

1820
02:36:02,613 --> 02:36:07,117
I shall not be seeing you again,
perhaps for a very long time.

1821
02:36:08,535 --> 02:36:11,079
I would like to sing for you now

1822
02:36:11,788 --> 02:36:13,373
a love song.

1823
02:36:15,292 --> 02:36:17,503
I know you share this love.

1824
02:36:18,837 --> 02:36:22,549
I pray that you will never let it die.

1825
02:36:35,270 --> 02:36:38,398
Edelweiss

1826
02:36:39,024 --> 02:36:41,652
Edelweiss

1827
02:36:42,486 --> 02:36:47,908
Every morning you greet me

1828
02:36:48,825 --> 02:36:51,495
Small and white

1829
02:36:51,954 --> 02:36:54,748
Clean and bright

1830
02:36:55,290 --> 02:37:00,671
You look happy to meet me

1831
02:37:01,255 --> 02:37:03,215
Blossom of snow

1832
02:37:03,257 --> 02:37:06,677
May you bloom and grow

1833
02:37:07,344 --> 02:37:13,016
Bloom and grow forever

1834
02:37:14,476 --> 02:37:16,186
Edelweiss

1835
02:37:17,312 --> 02:37:18,981
Edelweiss

1836
02:37:20,023 --> 02:37:26,029
Bless my homeland forever

1837
02:37:30,534 --> 02:37:33,036
Edelweiss

1838
02:37:33,996 --> 02:37:35,330
Edel...

1839
02:37:42,796 --> 02:37:46,008
Small and white

1840
02:37:46,049 --> 02:37:48,969
Clean and bright

1841
02:37:49,011 --> 02:37:54,725
You look happy to meet me

1842
02:37:55,184 --> 02:37:57,311
Blossom of snow

1843
02:37:57,352 --> 02:38:00,898
May you bloom and grow

1844
02:38:01,481 --> 02:38:07,446
Bloom and grow forever

1845
02:38:07,905 --> 02:38:11,158
Edelweiss

1846
02:38:11,200 --> 02:38:14,119
Edelweiss

1847
02:38:14,494 --> 02:38:21,251
Bless my homeland forever

1848
02:38:40,437 --> 02:38:42,231
I think it'll work.

1849
02:38:42,773 --> 02:38:44,900
I shall miss all of you.

1850
02:38:44,942 --> 02:38:47,778
I shall miss the money
I could have made with you.

1851
02:38:50,948 --> 02:38:53,242
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

1852
02:38:53,283 --> 02:38:56,119
The competition has come
to its conclusion

1853
02:38:56,161 --> 02:38:59,581
except, we don't know
yet what that conclusion will be.

1854
02:39:00,207 --> 02:39:03,001
And while the judges
arrive at their decision,

1855
02:39:03,043 --> 02:39:06,255
I have been given permission
to offer you an encore.

1856
02:39:06,296 --> 02:39:09,675
This will be the last opportunity
the von Trapps will have

1857
02:39:09,716 --> 02:39:12,636
of singing together
for a long, long time.

1858
02:39:13,262 --> 02:39:16,640
Even now, officials are waiting
in this auditorium

1859
02:39:17,432 --> 02:39:20,352
to escort Captain von Trapp
to his new command

1860
02:39:20,394 --> 02:39:23,313
in the naval forces
of the Third Reich.

1861
02:39:28,610 --> 02:39:33,115
And so, ladies and gentlemen,
the family von Trapp again

1862
02:39:33,782 --> 02:39:35,826
to bid you farewell.

1863
02:39:43,292 --> 02:39:47,129
There's a sad sort of clanging
From the clock in the hall

1864
02:39:47,171 --> 02:39:50,507
And the bells in the steeple, too

1865
02:39:51,049 --> 02:39:55,053
And up in the nursery
An absurd little bird

1866
02:39:55,095 --> 02:39:57,639
Is popping out to say "coo-coo"

1867
02:39:57,681 --> 02:39:59,349
Coo-coo

1868
02:39:59,641 --> 02:40:00,893
Coo-coo

1869
02:40:00,934 --> 02:40:02,769
-Regretfully, they tell us
-Coo-coo

1870
02:40:02,811 --> 02:40:04,813
-But firmly they compel us
-Coo-coo

1871
02:40:04,855 --> 02:40:07,274
To say goodbye

1872
02:40:07,816 --> 02:40:12,988
To you

1873
02:40:16,033 --> 02:40:19,578
So long, farewell
Auf Wiedersehen, good night

1874
02:40:19,620 --> 02:40:23,207
We hate to go
And miss this pretty sight

1875
02:40:29,713 --> 02:40:33,342
So long, farewell
Auf Wiedersehen, adieu

1876
02:40:33,383 --> 02:40:37,054
Adieu, adieu
To you and you and you

1877
02:40:43,477 --> 02:40:47,105
So long, farewell
Auf Wiedersehen, goodbye

1878
02:40:47,147 --> 02:40:48,732
We flit, we float

1879
02:40:49,024 --> 02:40:50,859
We fleetly flee, we fly

1880
02:40:57,241 --> 02:41:01,036
So long, farewell
Auf Wiedersehen, goodbye

1881
02:41:01,078 --> 02:41:04,498
The sun has gone to bed
And so must I

1882
02:41:04,748 --> 02:41:07,417
Goodbye

1883
02:41:08,961 --> 02:41:14,383
Goodbye

1884
02:41:14,424 --> 02:41:19,346
Goodbye

1885
02:41:20,097 --> 02:41:24,768
Goodbye

1886
02:41:59,094 --> 02:42:03,432
Ladies and gentlemen, I have here the
decision of our distinguished judges.

1887
02:42:03,473 --> 02:42:06,393
We will start with the award
for third prize.

1888
02:42:06,685 --> 02:42:09,021
For this honor,
the judges have named

1889
02:42:09,271 --> 02:42:13,901
the first soloist of the choir
of St. Agatha's Church in Murback.

1890
02:42:14,151 --> 02:42:16,111
Fräulein Schweiger.

1891
02:42:53,273 --> 02:42:57,194
Second prize
to The Toby Reiser Quintet.

1892
02:43:25,222 --> 02:43:28,892
And the first prize,
the highest honor in all Austria,

1893
02:43:29,643 --> 02:43:31,979
to the von Trapp Family Singers.

1894
02:43:44,908 --> 02:43:46,827
The family von Trapp.

1895
02:44:01,383 --> 02:44:02,843
They're gone!

1896
02:44:21,111 --> 02:44:22,613
Come with me.

1897
02:44:26,408 --> 02:44:28,410
Quickly, quickly.

1898
02:44:29,161 --> 02:44:31,413
I have a place you can hide.

1899
02:44:32,247 --> 02:44:35,000
Slowly, slowly.

1900
02:44:46,470 --> 02:44:48,222
Open this gate.

1901
02:44:49,306 --> 02:44:50,933
Good evening.

1902
02:44:53,435 --> 02:44:54,895
Hurry up, woman.

1903
02:45:14,873 --> 02:45:16,124
Two men in there.

1904
02:45:16,166 --> 02:45:18,001
Six of you cover the yard.

1905
02:45:18,252 --> 02:45:20,504
You two, cover the corridor.

1906
02:45:35,018 --> 02:45:38,814
Reverend Mother, we didn't realize
we put the abbey in this danger.

1907
02:45:38,856 --> 02:45:41,567
No, Maria, it was right for you
to come here.

1908
02:45:41,608 --> 02:45:43,652
We thought we might borrow
your car.

1909
02:45:43,694 --> 02:45:46,154
I'm afraid our car will do you
no good now.

1910
02:45:46,196 --> 02:45:47,990
I've been listening to the wires.

1911
02:45:48,031 --> 02:45:50,534
The borders have just been closed.

1912
02:45:56,456 --> 02:45:58,709
All right,
if the borders are closed,

1913
02:46:00,002 --> 02:46:03,338
then we'll drive up into the hills
and go over the mountains on foot.

1914
02:46:03,881 --> 02:46:06,133
-The children?
-We'll help them.

1915
02:46:06,175 --> 02:46:08,594
We can do it without help, Father.

1916
02:46:09,386 --> 02:46:10,804
Maria.

1917
02:46:11,471 --> 02:46:14,308
You will not be alone.
Remember,

1918
02:46:14,349 --> 02:46:18,478
"I will lift up mine eyes unto
the hills from whence cometh my help."

1919
02:46:18,520 --> 02:46:19,897
Yes, Mother.

1920
02:46:20,898 --> 02:46:23,317
-I'm scared.
-Me, too.

1921
02:46:35,162 --> 02:46:36,788
God be with you.

1922
02:46:43,253 --> 02:46:45,005
-Mother.
-Yes?

1923
02:46:45,047 --> 02:46:48,467
Would it help if we sang
about our favorite things?

1924
02:46:48,509 --> 02:46:51,720
No, darling.
This is one time it would not help.

1925
02:46:51,762 --> 02:46:55,265
You must be very quiet.
Hold tight to me.

1926
02:49:09,816 --> 02:49:11,652
Let's try the roof.

1927
02:50:07,291 --> 02:50:08,917
Rolfe, please.

1928
02:50:14,464 --> 02:50:16,133
No, wait.

1929
02:50:25,851 --> 02:50:27,269
Maria.

1930
02:50:28,312 --> 02:50:29,730
Children.

1931
02:50:33,817 --> 02:50:36,195
It's you we want, not them.

1932
02:50:37,070 --> 02:50:38,822
Put that down.

1933
02:50:39,907 --> 02:50:42,618
Not another move,
or I'll shoot.

1934
02:50:44,995 --> 02:50:46,997
You're only a boy.

1935
02:50:50,000 --> 02:50:53,462
-You don't really belong to them.
-Stay where you are.

1936
02:50:55,380 --> 02:50:57,216
Come away with us.

1937
02:50:58,634 --> 02:51:00,344
Before it's too late.

1938
02:51:00,385 --> 02:51:02,721
Not another step.
I'll kill you.

1939
02:51:05,057 --> 02:51:08,352
-You give that to me, Rolfe.
-Did you hear me?

1940
02:51:09,353 --> 02:51:10,938
I'll kill you.

1941
02:51:12,856 --> 02:51:14,149
Rolfe.

1942
02:51:32,668 --> 02:51:34,795
You'll never be one of them.

1943
02:51:36,755 --> 02:51:37,881
Lieutenant!

1944
02:51:38,632 --> 02:51:39,925
They're here!

1945
02:51:39,967 --> 02:51:41,844
They're here, Lieutenant!

1946
02:52:22,926 --> 02:52:24,553
Reverend Mother.

1947
02:52:25,762 --> 02:52:27,598
I have sinned.

1948
02:52:28,765 --> 02:52:30,934
I too, Reverend Mother.

1949
02:52:32,603 --> 02:52:34,897
What is this sin, my children?

1950
02:53:01,340 --> 02:53:04,927
A dream that will need

1951
02:53:04,968 --> 02:53:11,016
All the love you can give

1952
02:53:11,058 --> 02:53:14,603
Every day of your life

1953
02:53:14,645 --> 02:53:21,568
For as long as you live

1954
02:53:22,069 --> 02:53:26,532
Climb every mountain

1955
02:53:27,241 --> 02:53:31,703
Ford every stream

1956
02:53:32,162 --> 02:53:37,209
Follow every rainbow

1957
02:53:37,251 --> 02:53:41,797
Till you find

1958
02:53:41,839 --> 02:53:48,762
Your dream

1959
02:54:32,514 --> 02:54:33,515
