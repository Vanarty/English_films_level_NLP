they checked his trades

176
00:06:13,107 --> 00:06:15,006
Enough to decide
it was okay with the risk

177
00:06:15,008 --> 00:06:16,842
But not enough
to put it in writing.

178
00:06:16,844 --> 00:06:18,110
Okay, but why wouldn't
they put it in writing?

179
00:06:18,112 --> 00:06:19,911
Because they would rather
say I went rogue

180
00:06:19,913 --> 00:06:21,813
Than pay a $2 million fine.

181
00:06:21,815 --> 00:06:23,515
Here's the problem, sam.

182
00:06:23,517 --> 00:06:26,151
Why should I believe you,
when the last time we met

183
00:06:26,153 --> 00:06:28,520
You were the one
who was willing to put

184
00:06:28,522 --> 00:06:29,921
An innocent person away?

185
00:06:29,923 --> 00:06:31,957
Because I didn't know
she was innocent.

186
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:35,927
And the truth is...
I didn't care.

187
00:06:35,929 --> 00:06:38,997
But you did.

188
00:06:38,999 --> 00:06:41,867
I'm telling you...

189
00:06:41,869 --> 00:06:44,503
I didn't do this.

190
00:06:44,505 --> 00:06:48,106
Please, I need your help.

191
00:06:48,108 --> 00:06:49,941
If I find out
you're lying to me,

192
00:06:49,943 --> 00:06:51,877
This time I won't
just threaten you.

193
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:55,447
I will beat the shit out of you.

Donna, could I talk to you
for a minute?

205
00:07:34,977 --> 00:07:36,977
Yeah, if you can tell me
where the honey is hiding.

206
00:07:38,091 --> 00:07:39,624
Hey, hey, hey.

207
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:43,195
Oh, sneaky little bear.

208
00:07:43,197 --> 00:07:44,796
So what's on your mind?

209
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:45,997
Okay, so I'm trying to plan

210
00:07:45,999 --> 00:07:47,165
Something special
for our wedding.

211
00:07:47,167 --> 00:07:48,800
What? We're getting married?

212
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:50,902
Mike, this is so sudden. I'm
gonna have to think about it.

213
00:07:50,904 --> 00:07:52,571
And what about rachel?
Oh, who cares about rachel?

214
00:07:52,573 --> 00:07:53,939
- I love you.
- Are you finished?

215
00:07:53,941 --> 00:07:56,107
- Do I have to be?
- Donna, I'm serious.

216
00:07:56,109 --> 00:07:57,909
Okay, what do you need?

217
00:07:57,911 --> 00:07:59,644
Rachel told me
it was her fantasy

218
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:01,947
To get married on her birthday
at the plaza hotel.

219
00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:04,015
So I called to arrange it,
but then...

220
00:08:04,017 --> 00:08:05,951
They're booked
for the next five years.

221
00:08:05,953 --> 00:08:07,736
How did you know that?

222
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:09,520
Same reason you came to me
for help... i know what I know.

223
00:08:09,523 --> 00:08:11,523
Well, I need someplace
just as good.

224
00:08:11,525 --> 00:08:12,924
There is no place just as good.

225
00:08:12,926 --> 00:08:14,459
So what am I supposed to do?

226
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:15,993
You already did
what you're supposed to do.

227
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:18,063
You came to me.

228
00:08:18,065 --> 00:08:22,067
Now, put brody back
and don't hide him this time.

229
00:08:22,069 --> 00:08:23,802
You named the bear?

230
00:08:23,804 --> 00:08:25,871
You want me to help you or not?

231
00:08:31,912 --> 00:08:33,044
Paul gilroy.

232
00:08:33,046 --> 00:08:34,880
Yes. And you are?

233
00:08:34,882 --> 00:08:38,550
I'm the guy who's gonna
keep sam tull out of jail.

234
00:08:38,552 --> 00:08:39,985
And how are you
gonna do that, mister...

235
00:08:39,987 --> 00:08:41,620
Specter.

236
00:08:41,622 --> 00:08:43,922
Harvey specter.

237
00:08:43,924 --> 00:08:47,192
You're gonna pay that fine
and admit what you did.

238
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:50,195
Well, I'm sorry
to disappoint you, mr. Specter,

239
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:52,898
But there's no way I'm admitting
to something I didn't do.

240
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,733
Whether you admit it or not,

241
00:08:54,734 --> 00:08:56,567
You're gonna write a check
either way.

242
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:59,704
It's up to you whether it's
for $2 million or $30 million.

243
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:01,740
My associate seems
to be running late,

244
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:03,775
So go ahead, take me for
a walk down bullshit lane.

245
00:09:03,777 --> 00:09:05,544
We're suing you for $30 million.

246
00:09:05,546 --> 00:09:07,712
Well, I must have fired
five other people,

247
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:10,549
Because wrongful termination's
capped at $5 million.

248
00:09:10,551 --> 00:09:12,250
We're not suing you
for wrongful termination.

249
00:09:12,252 --> 00:09:14,719
We're suing you
for malicious prosecution.

250
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:16,321
You can't do that.
I'm not a prosecutor.

251
00:09:16,323 --> 00:09:18,189
No, you're not,
but you're framing my client

252
00:09:18,191 --> 00:09:20,158
For a crime he didn't commit.

253
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,760
So it's up to you, paul.

254
00:09:21,762 --> 00:09:23,862
Write the little check
or the big check.

255
00:09:23,864 --> 00:09:26,898
Ball's in your court.

256
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:34,906
Dominic, you're here early.
How are you?

257
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:36,391
Good.

258
00:09:36,392 --> 00:09:37,875
In fact, I was just thinking
about the last time I was here.

259
00:09:37,878 --> 00:09:39,461
You were helping me become ceo.

260
00:09:39,462 --> 00:09:41,045
Oh, come on, you pretty much
became ceo all on your own.

261
00:09:41,048 --> 00:09:42,981
Well, it doesn't matter
how I got there.

262
00:09:42,983 --> 00:09:45,216
You're gonna help me stay there.

263
00:09:45,218 --> 00:09:46,985
What's that?

264
00:09:46,987 --> 00:09:49,721
The future
of battery-powered engines.

265
00:09:49,723 --> 00:09:52,190
We need it, or we don't survive.

266
00:09:52,192 --> 00:09:53,992
I'm guessing there's a catch.

267
00:09:53,994 --> 00:09:55,694
The catch is it costs a fortune.

268
00:09:55,696 --> 00:09:59,197
But I have a handshake deal
with the ceo of range tech.

269
00:09:59,199 --> 00:10:00,765
We started
as mechanics together,

270
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:03,235
And if I can close in two weeks,

271
00:10:03,236 --> 00:10:05,704
He'll sell me the whole company
at a price I can afford.

272
00:10:05,706 --> 00:10:09,007
If I can't,
he puts it on the market.

273
00:10:09,009 --> 00:10:11,309
We'll be out of business
in ten years.

274
00:10:11,311 --> 00:10:12,527
(louis) what's going on?

275
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:13,744
You guys starting
the meeting without me?

276
00:10:13,747 --> 00:10:14,946
No, dominic just got here early,

277
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:16,648
But the headline is he wants us

278
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:18,283
To close a handshake deal
to buy range tech

279
00:10:18,285 --> 00:10:19,718
Within the next two weeks,

280
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,019
And I was about to tell him
that we could.

281
00:10:21,021 --> 00:10:23,355
Well, I'm sorry, but we can't.

282
00:10:23,357 --> 00:10:24,923
What do you mean you can't?

283
00:10:24,925 --> 00:10:26,891
I mean there's no way that
we can close a deal like this

284
00:10:26,893 --> 00:10:28,326
In two weeks without skipping
due diligence.

285
00:10:28,328 --> 00:10:30,729
No, louis, he's known
the ceo for 30 years.

286
00:10:30,731 --> 00:10:31,963
So we don't have to skip it,

287
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:34,232
But we can do
a streamlined version.

288
00:10:34,234 --> 00:10:36,001
Okay, well, then we might
as well not do it at all.

289
00:10:36,003 --> 00:10:37,402
We don't get it done
in that time,

290
00:10:37,404 --> 00:10:38,870
I can lose this deal.

291
00:10:38,872 --> 00:10:39,904
They put a clock on it.

292
00:10:39,906 --> 00:10:40,972
And why would they do that?

293
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:42,340
I'll tell you why,

294
00:10:42,342 --> 00:10:43,942
Because they know
you won't pay attention

295
00:10:43,944 --> 00:10:46,011
To whatever it is that they're
trying to slide by you.

296
00:10:46,013 --> 00:10:47,779
Slide something by me?

297
00:10:47,781 --> 00:10:49,981
This is my friend.
We have a handshake deal.

298
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,683
A handshake deal
doesn't mean shit.

299
00:10:51,685 --> 00:10:53,018
- Louis!
- It's okay, mike.

300
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:55,186
Obviously louis doesn't get me.

301
00:10:55,188 --> 00:10:59,391
Because to me, a handshake deal
means everything.

302
00:11:01,128 --> 00:11:03,828
So you do whatever due diligence
you can in the next week,

303
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,797
Because if you mess up my deal,

304
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:08,166
I'll be looking
for a new law firm.

305
00:11:12,239 --> 00:11:15,106
[elevator bell dings]

306
00:11:15,108 --> 00:11:16,975
Paul gilroy's lawyer called.

307
00:11:16,977 --> 00:11:18,060
That was fast.

308
00:11:18,061 --> 00:11:19,144
Want the bad news
or the worse news?

309
00:11:19,146 --> 00:11:20,295
Why don't you give me both

310
00:11:20,296 --> 00:11:21,445
And let me decide
what kind of news it is.

311
00:11:21,448 --> 00:11:22,947
Not only are they not
paying the fine.

312
00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:25,216
They also filed a motion
to have our suit dismissed.

313
00:11:28,755 --> 00:11:31,022
- Man, I should've known.
- Should've known what?

314
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:33,224
That you were full of shit
when you said dominic calling me

315
00:11:33,226 --> 00:11:34,993
To set up that meeting
didn't bother you.

316
00:11:34,995 --> 00:11:36,545
I don't care who he called.

317
00:11:36,546 --> 00:11:38,096
I did what I did in there
because the client comes first.

318
00:11:38,098 --> 00:11:39,964
Bullshit, you antagonized me
and then dominic.

319
00:11:39,966 --> 00:11:41,533
Oh, what meeting were you in?

320
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:43,101
I wasn't antagonizing him.
I was protecting him.

321
00:11:43,103 --> 00:11:44,553
Oh, really?

322
00:11:44,554 --> 00:11:46,004
By shitting all over his idea
and then pissing him off?

323
00:11:46,006 --> 00:11:47,205
I don't care
if we pissed him off.

324
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:48,973
He doesn't need a friend.

325
00:11:48,975 --> 00:11:50,475
What he needs is for us
to be great lawyers.

326
00:11:50,477 --> 00:11:52,410
Louis, you have a history
of getting bent out of shape

327
00:11:52,412 --> 00:11:54,079
Over hierarchy, so don't tell me

328
00:11:54,081 --> 00:11:55,447
That has nothing to do
with this.

329
00:11:55,449 --> 00:11:56,981
Okay, fine, mike.
You know what, you're right.

330
00:11:56,983 --> 00:11:58,917
I did get bent out of shape.
<i>Did.</i>

331
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:00,952
But then I got over it,
because as I said,

332
00:12:00,954 --> 00:12:02,721
The client comes first.

333
00:12:02,723 --> 00:12:04,356
You really expect me
to believe that?

334
00:12:04,357 --> 00:12:05,990
Mike, a few years ago,
dominic spent 90% of his time

335
00:12:05,992 --> 00:12:07,258
Under the hood.

336
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:08,827
He is rushing into this

337
00:12:08,829 --> 00:12:10,795
Because he feels it's his only
chance, and you know it.

338
00:12:10,797 --> 00:12:13,264
You think harvey would sign off
on this without due diligence?

339
00:12:13,266 --> 00:12:15,033
[sighs]

340
00:12:15,035 --> 00:12:17,135
And let me guess, you expect me
to do all the work?

341
00:12:17,137 --> 00:12:19,137
No, you take half, I take half.

342
00:12:19,139 --> 00:12:21,840
We do the work together.

343
00:12:28,882 --> 00:12:29,114
.

344
00:12:29,116 --> 00:12:31,083
(donna)
oh, you're not hearing me.

345
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:33,051
- Oh, I'm hearing you.
- No, you're not.

346
00:12:33,053 --> 00:12:35,120
I'm calling on behalf
of michael jordan.

347
00:12:35,122 --> 00:12:36,988
I don't care who
you're calling for.

348
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:38,823
We're booked on that date.

349
00:12:38,825 --> 00:12:41,826
Oh, but your assistant,
ginny, said that the smiths

350
00:12:41,828 --> 00:12:43,828
Might be willing to, um...

351
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:46,131
First of all,
it's patricia, not ginny.

352
00:12:46,133 --> 00:12:48,133
And it's the mcmillans,
not the smiths.

353
00:12:48,135 --> 00:12:49,868
So, if you don't have
anything else, then...

354
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:51,770
You know what?
That was a legitimate question,

355
00:12:51,772 --> 00:12:53,371
And it would be nice
if you weren't so rude.

356
00:12:53,373 --> 00:12:55,907
So the least you can do
is messenger over a brochure,

357
00:12:55,909 --> 00:12:57,542
Because if you don't,

358
00:12:57,543 --> 00:12:59,176
Mr. Jordan is gonna call
the manager of the plaza

359
00:12:59,179 --> 00:13:02,113
And get your ass fired.

360
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:08,987
Louis, I need to talk to you.

361
00:13:08,989 --> 00:13:10,389
I was just on my way to see you.

362
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:11,790
About the pending
epa investigation?

363
00:13:11,792 --> 00:13:13,091
- Shit.
- I thought you'd be gloating.

364
00:13:13,093 --> 00:13:14,259
You're the one who wanted this.

365
00:13:14,261 --> 00:13:15,860
I didn't want this.
I feared this.

366
00:13:15,862 --> 00:13:17,896
If dominic buys range tech,
he's in huge trouble.

367
00:13:17,898 --> 00:13:19,330
And if we tell him that
without having a solution,

368
00:13:19,332 --> 00:13:20,465
He'll fire us.

369
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:21,983
That's the thing.
I have a solution.

370
00:13:21,984 --> 00:13:23,500
I found a company
that has a battery division

371
00:13:23,503 --> 00:13:24,769
That we can buy.

372
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:26,036
Now, we just have
to approach them and...

373
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:27,038
No. Did you not just
hear what I said?

374
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,373
We cannot jeopardize his deal.

375
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:29,853
We won't be jeopardizing it

376
00:13:29,854 --> 00:13:31,332
If we can get them to sign
a nondisclosure agreement.

377
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:32,811
And the only way we'll be able
to get them to do that

378
00:13:32,813 --> 00:13:34,045
Is if they're our client.

379
00:13:34,047 --> 00:13:35,880
Well, then it's
a good thing they are.

380
00:13:35,882 --> 00:13:37,015
You found one
of our own clients?

381
00:13:37,017 --> 00:13:38,116
You're a genius.

382
00:13:38,118 --> 00:13:39,284
Yeah, there's only one problem.

383
00:13:39,286 --> 00:13:40,518
They're jack soloff's client.

384
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,086
Forget it, we need to find
another company.

385
00:13:42,088 --> 00:13:43,288
There is no other company.

386
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:44,422
Mike, there is no way
that soloff

387
00:13:44,424 --> 00:13:46,124
Will work with us on this.
He hates me.

388
00:13:46,126 --> 00:13:47,959
Then we have to find a way
to make him un-hate you,

389
00:13:47,961 --> 00:13:50,061
Because I'm telling you,
this deal is good for jack,

390
00:13:50,063 --> 00:13:51,196
And it is good for us.

391
00:13:51,198 --> 00:13:54,032
There has to be a way.

392
00:13:54,034 --> 00:13:56,267
Well, then you talk to him.

393
00:13:56,269 --> 00:13:58,002
Are you... are you saying
you want me

394
00:13:58,004 --> 00:13:59,971
To negotiate with soloff
on my own?

395
00:13:59,973 --> 00:14:01,973
I'm saying we're a team,
and there's a better chance

396
00:14:01,975 --> 00:14:03,508
Of soloff saying yes
to you than to me.

397
00:14:08,448 --> 00:14:10,014
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

398
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:11,349
What are you doing here?

399
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:13,151
I was just getting an nda.
What are you doing here?

400
00:14:13,153 --> 00:14:15,186
I am actually here for you.

401
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:18,590
I'm making copies of a brochure
from the plaza hotel.

402
00:14:18,592 --> 00:14:20,258
Wait, so you got it done?

403
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:22,493
No, I called them,
and they were dicks,

404
00:14:22,495 --> 00:14:24,395
And they got pissed at me.

405
00:14:24,397 --> 00:14:26,898
So you failed?

406
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,499
Okay.

407
00:14:28,501 --> 00:14:30,268
If by "failed,"

408
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:32,003
You mean I got the name

409
00:14:32,005 --> 00:14:33,438
Of the wedding planner,
her assistant,

410
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,606
The couple getting married,

411
00:14:34,608 --> 00:14:36,941
And a brochure
with their letterhead on it,

412
00:14:36,943 --> 00:14:38,509
Then, yeah, mike,
yeah, I failed.

413
00:14:38,511 --> 00:14:40,879
Whoa, donna, are you sure
you can handle this?

414
00:14:40,881 --> 00:14:42,280
Do you ask a chef who's cooking

415
00:14:42,282 --> 00:14:44,916
If the meal's gonna
turn out okay?

416
00:14:44,918 --> 00:14:47,085
No, you sit back,
you behave yourself

417
00:14:47,087 --> 00:14:49,621
Until you get the best
duck<i> à I'orange</i>

418
00:14:49,623 --> 00:14:51,122
You've ever tasted.

419
00:14:51,124 --> 00:14:53,057
Yeah, I don't really like duck
with orange stuff.

420
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:54,926
- Get out.
- Gone.

421
00:14:56,363 --> 00:14:58,997
[sighs]

422
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,034
I like the way you operate.

423
00:15:03,036 --> 00:15:04,569
Excuse me?

424
00:15:04,571 --> 00:15:06,971
Never let them see you sweat.

425
00:15:06,973 --> 00:15:08,640
What makes you think
I'm sweating?

426
00:15:08,642 --> 00:15:10,174
My eyes.

427
00:15:10,176 --> 00:15:11,976
You may have fooled opie
with that metaphor,

428
00:15:11,978 --> 00:15:14,112
But we both know you got
duck<i> à la</i> shit.

429
00:15:14,114 --> 00:15:17,048
Okay, new girl, I don't know
who you think you're talking to,

430
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:18,650
But this is what I do.

431
00:15:18,652 --> 00:15:20,985
What you do.

432
00:15:20,987 --> 00:15:22,654
I've been doing shit like this

433
00:15:22,656 --> 00:15:26,057
Since you was an itch
in your daddy's pants.

434
00:15:27,527 --> 00:15:31,162
Hang on, did you just
quote<i> lethal weapon</i> to me?

435
00:15:31,164 --> 00:15:33,164
You got that?

436
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:35,934
Maybe you do have something.

437
00:15:35,936 --> 00:15:39,003
Good luck with your duck, red.

438
00:15:41,374 --> 00:15:44,242
Mr. Tull, how long have you
been working at butler trading?

439
00:15:44,244 --> 00:15:46,010
Almost three years.

440
00:15:46,012 --> 00:15:47,111
And how much money have you made

441
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:48,479
For their clients
over that time?

442
00:15:48,481 --> 00:15:51,149
Approximately $150 million.

443
00:15:51,151 --> 00:15:52,973
So let me get this straight.

444
00:15:52,974 --> 00:15:54,796
You made a trade, lost money,
they did nothing.

445
00:15:54,797 --> 00:15:56,619
But the day they find out
that they have to pay a fine,

446
00:15:56,623 --> 00:15:58,556
They said you were acting alone

447
00:15:58,558 --> 00:16:00,358
And they're letting you
go to jail?

448
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,726
Exactly.

449
00:16:01,728 --> 00:16:04,195
And how do you know
they signed off on your trade?

450
00:16:04,196 --> 00:16:06,663
Because everyone knows that
they sign off on every trade.

451
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:09,133
And, ultimately,
who would be responsible

452
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:11,736
For stopping a trade
that violated regulations?

453
00:16:11,738 --> 00:16:14,138
Paul gilroy.

454
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:16,441
So it couldn't possibly be that
you knew what you were doing,

455
00:16:16,443 --> 00:16:19,377
You kept it secret, and that
all of this is your fault?

456
00:16:19,379 --> 00:16:21,312
It could be, but it isn't.

457
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:22,513
Well, that's interesting,

458
00:16:22,515 --> 00:16:24,482
Because we have somebody
who says it is.

459
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:25,616
And who the hell is that?

460
00:16:25,618 --> 00:16:27,352
- Mr. Tull's therapist.
- What?

461
00:16:27,353 --> 00:16:29,087
A therapist can't testify
against their own patient.

462
00:16:29,089 --> 00:16:30,722
She can if we paid for it
and he signed a waiver,

463
00:16:30,724 --> 00:16:32,590
Which he did.

464
00:16:34,995 --> 00:16:38,096
Mr. Tull, your therapist's
testimony is coming,

465
00:16:38,098 --> 00:16:41,566
And when it does, your ability
to cut a deal goes away.

466
00:16:41,568 --> 00:16:43,134
Drop this matter,

467
00:16:43,136 --> 00:16:47,138
And no one ever knows
you saw a therapist at all.

468
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:52,076
You went to see
a company-provided therapist,

469
00:16:52,078 --> 00:16:53,344
And you never told me?

470
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:54,545
I didn't think it mattered.

471
00:16:54,547 --> 00:16:56,347
Well, it goddamn does.

472
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:58,649
Did you tell this woman
you did this?

473
00:16:58,651 --> 00:17:00,251
No, because I didn't do this.

474
00:17:00,253 --> 00:17:02,220
Well, they're not bringing her
in to testify to that.

475
00:17:02,222 --> 00:17:03,721
I told her that I felt guilty,

476
00:17:03,723 --> 00:17:05,423
As if the whole thing
was my fault.

477
00:17:05,425 --> 00:17:07,125
I never said it was.

478
00:17:07,127 --> 00:17:08,293
Well, you might as well have,

479
00:17:08,294 --> 00:17:09,460
Because that's what
it's gonna sound like.

480
00:17:09,462 --> 00:17:11,062
- Harvey...
- How could you be so stupid

481
00:17:11,064 --> 00:17:13,131
To confide your feelings
to a stranger?

482
00:17:13,133 --> 00:17:14,432
Because I needed help.

483
00:17:14,434 --> 00:17:16,734
And if you're not gonna talk
about your feelings,

484
00:17:16,736 --> 00:17:18,736
You might as well
not see a therapist at all.

485
00:17:18,738 --> 00:17:20,605
You better hope
there are therapists in prison,

486
00:17:20,607 --> 00:17:22,240
Because if I can't
stop her from testifying,

487
00:17:22,242 --> 00:17:24,375
That's where
you're gonna end up.

488
00:17:35,422 --> 00:17:37,455
[knock at door]

489
00:17:37,457 --> 00:17:40,825
Mike ross, what brings you
down to my office?

490
00:17:40,827 --> 00:17:42,560
I'm here with a proposal
from louis.

491
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:44,562
You're here because
louis wants something from me,

492
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:46,130
But he's too afraid to ask.

493
00:17:46,132 --> 00:17:47,231
He's not afraid.

494
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:49,067
He just sent me here
because he figured

495
00:17:49,069 --> 00:17:51,102
You might hear it better
coming from me.

496
00:17:51,104 --> 00:17:52,437
Well...

497
00:17:52,438 --> 00:17:53,771
Mckernon motors wants
to make an investment

498
00:17:53,773 --> 00:17:55,473
In battery technology.

499
00:17:55,475 --> 00:17:58,376
We'd like to quietly negotiate
with tanaka,

500
00:17:58,378 --> 00:18:00,812
And we need your help
getting them to sign this.

501
00:18:02,382 --> 00:18:04,148
And why would I do that?

502
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:05,216
Because it's huge money,

503
00:18:05,218 --> 00:18:06,818
And now that
contingent compensation

504
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:08,820
Is back at the firm,
it's huge money for you.

505
00:18:08,822 --> 00:18:11,456
And the last time louis came
to me with an offer like this,

506
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:12,690
It was bullshit.

507
00:18:12,692 --> 00:18:15,093
Well, I'm not louis,
and this isn't bullshit.

508
00:18:15,095 --> 00:18:17,195
Then I guess I just
have one question.

509
00:18:17,197 --> 00:18:18,863
How much of the deal are you
authorized to give away?

510
00:18:18,865 --> 00:18:21,199
50%, and that's more than fair.

511
00:18:21,201 --> 00:18:23,801
Maybe it is,
but I want all of it.

512
00:18:23,803 --> 00:18:25,837
You know this helps
your client, right?

513
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:28,272
I don't give a shit.
All of it or none of it.

514
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:29,607
It's gonna be none of it,

515
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:31,275
And you're just taking money
out of your own pocket.

516
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:33,111
I don't care,

00:25:10,276 --> 00:25:11,942
He wanted to continue
with the risks,

693
00:25:11,944 --> 00:25:14,044
He just wanted
to feel better about it.

694
00:25:14,046 --> 00:25:15,412
Yes.

695
00:25:15,413 --> 00:25:16,779
And were you able
to help him feel better

696
00:25:16,782 --> 00:25:18,015
About taking these risks?

697
00:25:18,017 --> 00:25:19,984
Um, uh, we made progress.

698
00:25:19,986 --> 00:25:22,520
- Yes or no?
- Yes.

699
00:25:22,522 --> 00:25:25,289
And after you helped him
feel good about taking risks,

700
00:25:25,291 --> 00:25:29,994
Did he reveal that he then lost
$50 million on one trade?

701
00:25:31,964 --> 00:25:33,797
Dr. Agard, you are under oath.

702
00:25:33,799 --> 00:25:35,032
And if you will not answer,

703
00:25:35,034 --> 00:25:37,101
I will have a judge
compel you to answer.

704
00:25:37,103 --> 00:25:38,636
Yes.

705
00:25:38,638 --> 00:25:40,938
And how did he say he felt
about losing $50 million

706
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:42,673
On one trade?

707
00:25:42,675 --> 00:25:44,174
He said he felt guilty about it.

708
00:25:44,176 --> 00:25:47,077
So he came to you
to continue taking risks

709
00:25:47,079 --> 00:25:49,046
Until he finally
lost $50 million

710
00:25:49,048 --> 00:25:50,748
And then admitted
to being guilty.

711
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:51,882
That is not what she said.

712
00:25:51,884 --> 00:25:54,084
I'm sorry, he just felt guilty.

713
00:25:54,086 --> 00:25:55,686
You want to drop this now,

714
00:25:55,688 --> 00:25:58,789
Or do you want us to hand
this tape over to the sec?

715
00:26:03,696 --> 00:26:06,130
Dr. Agard, did you want to give
the testimony you just gave?

716
00:26:06,132 --> 00:26:08,032
- Of course not.
- And why is that?

717
00:26:08,034 --> 00:26:09,700
Because I care about my clients.

718
00:26:09,702 --> 00:26:10,901
Is it possible that
you didn't want to give it

719
00:26:10,903 --> 00:26:12,303
Because it's not true?

720
00:26:12,305 --> 00:26:14,004
No, it's not possible.

721
00:26:14,006 --> 00:26:15,306
You couldn't possibly
have been pressured

722
00:26:15,308 --> 00:26:18,676
To give false testimony
against your wishes?

723
00:26:18,678 --> 00:26:20,678
No, I couldn't have.

724
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,146
Have you ever been
pressured to do something

725
00:26:22,148 --> 00:26:25,249
You didn't want to do
by a client before?

726
00:26:25,251 --> 00:26:27,017
Let me rephrase.

727
00:26:27,019 --> 00:26:29,320
Isn't it true that you released
a client that you cared about

728
00:26:29,322 --> 00:26:31,655
From rehab for no reason

729
00:26:31,657 --> 00:26:34,158
Other than you felt pressure
from a different client

730
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:36,760
Who was actually paying
the bills?

731
00:26:36,762 --> 00:26:38,295
Dr. Agard, you're under oath,

732
00:26:38,297 --> 00:26:39,797
And if you will not answer,

733
00:26:39,799 --> 00:26:43,000
I will have a judge
compel you to answer.

734
00:26:43,002 --> 00:26:44,335
Yes.

735
00:26:44,336 --> 00:26:45,669
And did this person die
of an overdose

736
00:26:45,671 --> 00:26:47,237
Less than 24 hours later?

737
00:26:47,239 --> 00:26:48,806
Yes.

738
00:26:48,808 --> 00:26:50,808
So if you let yourself
be pressured

739
00:26:50,810 --> 00:26:52,076
When someone's life is at risk,

740
00:26:52,078 --> 00:26:53,377
What's to make us think
you're not doing

741
00:26:53,379 --> 00:26:55,045
The exact same thing right now?

742
00:27:08,094 --> 00:27:09,338
.

743
00:27:09,339 --> 00:27:10,583
You arrogant piece of shit.

744
00:27:10,584 --> 00:27:11,828
Watch yourself.
This is my office.

745
00:27:11,831 --> 00:27:13,031
Well, I don't care what it is.

746
00:27:13,032 --> 00:27:14,665
How dare you betray me
like that?

747
00:27:14,667 --> 00:27:16,867
- I tried to warn you.
- You didn't warn me.

748
00:27:16,869 --> 00:27:18,769
You asked me to lie for you,
and I told you I wouldn't.

749
00:27:18,771 --> 00:27:20,304
I asked you to lie
for sam tull...

750
00:27:20,306 --> 00:27:22,906
This isn't about sam tull,
and you know it.

751
00:27:22,908 --> 00:27:24,625
What the hell
are you talking about?

752
00:27:24,626 --> 00:27:26,343
I opened up to you
so that we could build trust,

753
00:27:26,345 --> 00:27:28,712
Not so that you could
humiliate me.

754
00:27:28,714 --> 00:27:30,114
I humiliated you to help a man

755
00:27:30,116 --> 00:27:31,649
You say you care about.

756
00:27:31,651 --> 00:27:32,883
And our fighting
about your mother

757
00:27:32,885 --> 00:27:34,229
Had nothing to do with that?

758
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:35,574
- Excuse me?
- You walked out of our session

759
00:27:35,575 --> 00:27:36,919
Because you didn't want
to talk about your mother.

760
00:27:36,922 --> 00:27:39,056
And the second
you had the chance

761
00:27:39,058 --> 00:27:41,225
To permanently damage
our relationship, you took it.

762
00:27:41,227 --> 00:27:42,426
You're insane.

763
00:27:42,428 --> 00:27:44,028
And you're
a self-serving narcissist

764
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:46,230
Who will do or say anything
to get what he wants.

765
00:27:46,232 --> 00:27:49,133
I did what I did in there
to protect my client.

766
00:27:49,135 --> 00:27:51,235
And I don't give a shit
if it hurt your feelings or not,

767
00:27:51,237 --> 00:27:52,670
Because you betrayed him

768
00:27:52,672 --> 00:27:54,104
Just as much
as I'm betraying you.

769
00:27:54,106 --> 00:27:56,140
And you may be the one
who's crying about it,

770
00:27:56,142 --> 00:28:00,110
But he's the one who's been
accused of committing a crime.

771
00:28:00,112 --> 00:28:02,680
If you're lucky,
someday you're gonna realize

772
00:28:02,682 --> 00:28:05,382
What's really going on here,
and when that day comes,

773
00:28:05,384 --> 00:28:07,051
I hope you find someone
to help you,

774
00:28:07,053 --> 00:28:09,953
Because it isn't going to be me.

775
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:18,962
Mike, put that coffee down
and check this out.

776
00:28:18,964 --> 00:28:22,099
It's a map of scarsdale...
Where I grew up.

777
00:28:22,101 --> 00:28:23,901
Tanaka returned the favor.

778
00:28:23,903 --> 00:28:25,903
Actually, louis,
I got that for you.

779
00:28:25,905 --> 00:28:28,138
You did? Why?

780
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:30,374
Because you were right
and I was wrong,

781
00:28:30,376 --> 00:28:32,976
And as crazy as it seems,

782
00:28:32,978 --> 00:28:35,279
You and I actually make
a pretty good team.

783
00:28:35,281 --> 00:28:37,081
Now all that's left

784
00:28:37,083 --> 00:28:39,349
Is calling dominic
to set up a meeting.

785
00:28:39,351 --> 00:28:41,051
Why don't you do it?

786
00:28:41,053 --> 00:28:42,019
I can't.

787
00:28:42,021 --> 00:28:44,121
I got to go hang my map.

788
00:28:48,861 --> 00:28:50,928
Dominic, what are you
doing here?

789
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:52,730
I was just about to call you.

790
00:28:52,732 --> 00:28:54,031
To say what,
that you blew up my deal?

791
00:28:54,033 --> 00:28:55,799
- Because I already know.
- What?

792
00:28:55,801 --> 00:28:57,334
That's right. Range tech
called me after they heard

793
00:28:57,336 --> 00:28:59,169
That I was negotiating
with another company.

794
00:28:59,171 --> 00:29:01,972
Problem is, I wasn't negotiating
with another company.

795
00:29:01,974 --> 00:29:04,408
My lawyers were
without my consent.

796
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:06,009
Okay, calm down, dominic.

797
00:29:06,011 --> 00:29:07,478
There was a problem
with range tech.

798
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:10,447
I told you that I didn't want
there to be any problems!

799
00:29:10,449 --> 00:29:11,882
Well, if you'd bought them,

800
00:29:11,884 --> 00:29:13,484
Their problems were gonna
become your problems.

801
00:29:13,486 --> 00:29:15,352
But just calm down
and take a second,

802
00:29:15,354 --> 00:29:16,954
Because we brought you
a solution.

803
00:29:16,956 --> 00:29:18,288
Which is what?

804
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:20,157
Mike, don't call dominic.
Tanaka pulled out.

805
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:24,027
Pulled out of what?

806
00:29:24,029 --> 00:29:25,229
It doesn't matter.

807
00:29:25,231 --> 00:29:26,930
You're both fired.

808
00:29:32,772 --> 00:29:34,338
- Harvey, I need to talk to you.
- Not now, rachel.

809
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:36,106
- Sam tull's been arrested.
- What?

810
00:29:36,108 --> 00:29:38,776
Gilroy's lawyer gave
formal notice to the sec.

811
00:29:38,778 --> 00:29:40,444
They won't pay the fine
under any circumstance.

812
00:29:40,446 --> 00:29:41,879
God damn it.

813
00:29:41,881 --> 00:29:43,080
Gretchen, get paul gilroy
on the phone.

814
00:29:43,082 --> 00:29:44,282
Harvey, what are you gonna do?

815
00:29:44,283 --> 00:29:45,916
Tull can't go to prison
for this.

816
00:29:45,918 --> 00:29:47,451
- No one's going to prison.
- But how do you now that?

817
00:29:47,453 --> 00:29:49,820
We didn't think he'd be
arrested in the first place.

818
00:29:49,822 --> 00:29:51,405
I don't care what we thought.

819
00:29:51,406 --> 00:29:52,989
It's not gonna happen because
I'm not letting it happen.

820
00:29:52,992 --> 00:29:55,025
I've got mr. Gilroy on line one.

821
00:29:55,027 --> 00:29:57,361
Are you out of your mind?
You contacted the sec?

822
00:29:57,363 --> 00:29:59,062
(gilroy) they contacted me.

823
00:29:59,064 --> 00:30:01,465
And I'm not the one who filed
a malicious prosecution lawsuit.

824
00:30:01,467 --> 00:30:03,133
No, you're the one
who got his ass kicked

825
00:30:03,135 --> 00:30:05,369
In a deposition then turned
around and asked for more.

826
00:30:05,371 --> 00:30:07,971
I didn't get my ass kicked,
mr. Specter.

827
00:30:07,973 --> 00:30:10,340
That idiot therapist did,
and she no longer works for us.

828
00:30:10,342 --> 00:30:11,975
But you still
don't have any proof

829
00:30:11,977 --> 00:30:14,444
That I authorized those trades,
and you never will.

830
00:30:14,446 --> 00:30:16,280
So I suggest
you stop harassing me

831
00:30:16,282 --> 00:30:19,016
And focus on getting
your client out of jail.

832
00:30:20,853 --> 00:30:22,419
You heard the man.

833
00:30:22,421 --> 00:30:23,954
We're dropping the lawsuit?

834
00:30:23,956 --> 00:30:25,455
No, we're doubling the damages.

835
00:30:25,457 --> 00:30:28,025
Get it done.

836
00:30:30,129 --> 00:30:32,563
You son of a bitch.
You set us up.

837
00:30:32,565 --> 00:30:35,132
I'm sorry, louis, I have no
idea what you're talking about.

838
00:30:35,134 --> 00:30:37,401
Oh, bullshit. You told
tanaka not to make a deal.

839
00:30:37,403 --> 00:30:38,602
Yes, I did.

840
00:30:38,604 --> 00:30:40,904
At first, it looked like
a good idea,

841
00:30:40,906 --> 00:30:42,306
But then I did my due diligence,

842
00:30:42,308 --> 00:30:44,208
And lo and behold, it didn't.

843
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:45,576
Was that before or after

844
00:30:45,578 --> 00:30:47,211
You leaked our meeting
to range tech?

845
00:30:47,213 --> 00:30:48,445
I have to say, I'm appalled.

846
00:30:48,447 --> 00:30:50,280
I mean, after you've been
so aboveboard

847
00:30:50,282 --> 00:30:51,949
In all your dealings with me,

848
00:30:51,951 --> 00:30:53,617
To think that I would
go behind your back

849
00:30:53,619 --> 00:30:56,186
And leak news of that meeting
with no possible chance

850
00:30:56,188 --> 00:30:58,956
Of it being linked back to me,
that's really offensive.

851
00:30:58,958 --> 00:31:00,991
It is linked back to you,
plain as day.

852
00:31:00,993 --> 00:31:02,626
Then I guess you two
must have some sort of proof,

853
00:31:02,628 --> 00:31:04,328
Because if you don't,

854
00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:07,998
You can walk yourselves
the hell out of my office.

855
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,534
It's one thing for you
to have your feud with me,

856
00:31:10,536 --> 00:31:14,071
But you just cost your firm
a huge piece of business.

857
00:31:14,073 --> 00:31:17,140
Let me explain to you
what I already told him.

858
00:31:17,142 --> 00:31:20,444
This isn't about business.
It's about getting even.

859
00:31:34,093 --> 00:31:36,159
Harvey, do you have a minute?

860
00:31:36,161 --> 00:31:38,262
If you're here to tell me
to drop that countersuit...

861
00:31:38,264 --> 00:31:39,930
I'm not telling you
to drop anything.

862
00:31:39,932 --> 00:31:41,665
I'm just saying in addition
to attacking gilroy,

863
00:31:41,667 --> 00:31:43,934
We should be getting proof
that sam got the authorization

864
00:31:43,936 --> 00:31:45,102
For those trades.

865
00:31:45,104 --> 00:31:46,504
We don't have any proof.

866
00:31:46,505 --> 00:31:47,905
We can if we get
some of the other traders

867
00:31:47,907 --> 00:31:49,172
To come forward
and say how it went.

868
00:31:49,174 --> 00:31:51,074
They'll never testify to that.

869
00:31:51,076 --> 00:31:52,943
Harvey, that therapist
was the company therapist.

870
00:31:52,945 --> 00:31:54,611
Those traders saw her
on a regular basis

871
00:31:54,613 --> 00:31:56,079
To keep their shit together.

872
00:31:56,081 --> 00:31:57,614
So, if sam opened up to her
about work,

873
00:31:57,616 --> 00:31:59,516

must have too.

00:32:00,986 --> 00:32:02,352
Of course she can.

If tull waived privilege,
then they all did.

You know that.

878
00:32:05,324 --> 00:32:07,024
It doesn't matter.
You saw what I did to her.

879
00:32:07,026 --> 00:32:08,726
She's not gonna want to help us.

880
00:32:08,727 --> 00:32:10,427
It's not about helping us.
It's about helping her client.

881
00:32:10,429 --> 00:32:11,628
I can't ask her to do that.

882
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:15,132
- Why not?
- Because I can't.

883
00:32:15,134 --> 00:32:19,503
- Harvey, what's going on?
- Nothing's going on.

884

How did you know those things
about her in that deposition?

885
00:32:22,141 --> 00:32:23,357
Because I did.

886
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:24,574

to do with the fact

panic attacks

888

And that she's your therapist?

889
00:32:27,346 --> 00:32:29,246
- Because if it does...
- This conversation is over.

890

Look, I am not trying
to butt into things

And if you'd bought them,

907

That suit would have
been headed your way.

908
00:33:18,564 --> 00:33:19,663
So, yes, we blew up the deal,

I am sorry. I shouldn't
have antagonized you.

And I shouldn't have said
that rushing through this deal

914

Without doing due diligence
was feasible.

is that we were both right

When we tried to do
this deal with tanaka.

And now that we've got
nothing to hide from you,

There is nothing to stop us
from finding you someone else.

No, I'm not. They all signed
the same waiver sam did.

932

Some of them must have admitted
the way it works at butler,

Because I know all you've
been trying to do is help me,

950

And the only reason
I didn't apologize before

951
00:34:55,127 --> 00:34:57,594
Is because if I knew
it kept sam out of prison,

952
