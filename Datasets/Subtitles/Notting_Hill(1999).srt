Oh, God. This is one
of those key moments in life...

you can be really genuinely cool...

Well, happy birthday.

- You haven't slept with her, have you?

543
00:37:13,207 --> 00:37:15,641
That is a cheap question, and
the answer is, of course, no comment.

544
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:17,644
- No comment means "yes."
- No, it doesn't.

- Do you ever masturbate?
- Definitely no comment.

- [ Honey ] Oh, my God!

So, uh, tell me,
um, Anna, what do you do?

- I'm an actress.
- Oh, splendid.

What do you do?

550
00:37:32,994 --> 00:37:36,760
I'm actually in the stock market myself,
so, uh, not really similar fields.

Though, um-- um, I have done
the odd bit of amateur stuff.

"Careful there, Vicar."

Always imagined it's a pretty tough job,
though, acting.

555
00:37:50,645 --> 00:37:54,638
- The wages are a scandal, aren't they?
- They can be.

556
00:37:54,715 --> 00:37:56,683
I see friends from university--

They're scraping by on seven,
eight thousand a year.

You know, it's no life.

560
00:38:05,993 --> 00:38:10,362
- What sort of acting do you do?
- Films, mainly.

561
00:38:10,431 --> 00:38:15,334
Oh, splendid. Oh, well done.
How's the pay in movies?

562
00:38:15,403 --> 00:38:20,306
I mean, last film you did,
what did you get paid?

563
00:38:20,374 --> 00:38:22,604
Fifteen million dollars.

564
00:38:23,678 --> 00:38:25,612
Right.

565
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:29,878
So that's, well, fairly good.

Oh, sorry.
It's down the corridor on the right.

- What did you say to her?

I don't believe it.
I actually walked into the loo with her.

578
00:39:00,781 --> 00:39:03,648
I was still chatting
when she started unbuttoning her jeans.

- She had to ask me to leave.
- Oh, God.

00:40:05,155 --> 00:40:09,091
Having you here, Anna, firmly
establishes what I've long suspected--

that we really are the most
desperate lot of underachievers.

596

- I'm not saying it's a bad thing.

getting promoted above me.

well, since puberty.

1673
01:56:33,318 --> 01:56:36,810
Right. Uh, Dominic, if you'd
like to ask your question again?

1674
01:56:36,888 --> 01:56:42,292
Yeah? Anna, how long are you
intending to stay here in Britain?

1675
01:56:50,167 --> 01:56:52,835
Indefinitely.

1676
01:56:59,343 --> 01:57:04,303
She may be the face I can't forget

1677
01:57:04,381 --> 01:57:07,714
The trace of pleasure or regret

1678
01:57:07,785 --> 01:57:13,690
May be my treasure
or the price I have to pay

1679
01:57:13,757 --> 01:57:17,090
- She may be the song that
- What happened?

1680
01:57:17,161 --> 01:57:19,129
- Summer sings
- It was good.

1681
01:57:19,196 --> 01:57:23,030
May be the chill the autumn brings

1682
01:57:23,100 --> 01:57:26,160
May be a hundred different things

1683
01:57:26,237 --> 01:57:30,571
Within the measure of a day

1684
01:57:32,476 --> 01:57:37,539
She may be the beauty or the beast

1685
01:57:37,615 --> 01:57:41,813
May be the famine or the feast

1686
01:57:41,886 --> 01:57:47,085
May turn each day
into a heaven or a hell

1687
01:57:47,157 --> 01:57:52,185
She may be the mirror of my dream

1688
01:57:52,263 --> 01:57:55,630
The smile reflected in a stream

1689
01:57:55,699 --> 01:57:59,635
She may not be what she may seems

1690
01:57:59,703 --> 01:58:03,195
Inside her shell

1691
01:58:35,506 --> 01:58:37,974
[ Crowd Cheering, Shouting ]

1692
01:58:38,042 --> 01:58:42,411
She who always seems
so happy in a crowd

1693
01:58:42,479 --> 01:58:46,916
Whose eyes can be
so private and so proud

1694
01:58:46,984 --> 01:58:49,418
No one's allowed to see them

1695
01:58:49,486 --> 01:58:53,582
When they cry

1696
01:58:53,657 --> 01:58:57,889
She may be the love
that cannot hope to last

1697
01:58:57,962 --> 01:59:01,213
May come to me
from shadows of the past

1698
01:59:01,347 --> 01:59:07,445
That I remember till the day I die

1699
01:59:07,520 --> 01:59:12,457
She may be the reason I survive

1700
01:59:12,525 --> 01:59:16,256
The why and wherefore I'm alive

1701
01:59:16,328 --> 01:59:19,661
The one I'll care for
through the rough

1702
01:59:19,732 --> 01:59:22,200
And ready years

1703
01:59:22,268 --> 01:59:27,069
Me, I'll take her laughter
and her tears

1704
01:59:27,139 --> 01:59:30,768
And make them all my souvenirs

1705
01:59:30,843 --> 01:59:34,404
For where she goes I've got to be

1706
01:59:34,480 --> 01:59:37,745
The meaning of my life is

1707
01:59:37,817 --> 01:59:40,718
She

1708
01:59:40,786 --> 01:59:46,691
She

1709
01:59:46,759 --> 01:59:51,856
Oh, she

1710
02:00:02,141 --> 02:00:06,009
It's in the way you are

1711
02:00:06,078 --> 02:00:10,378
You've got a way with me

1712
02:00:12,685 --> 02:00:17,486
Somehow you got me to believe

1713
02:00:19,992 --> 02:00:25,658
In everything that I could be

1714
02:00:25,731 --> 02:00:27,722
I gotta say

1715
02:00:27,800 --> 02:00:31,292
You really got a way

1716
02:00:31,370 --> 02:00:35,807
It's in the way you want me

1717
02:00:38,210 --> 02:00:43,147
It's in the way you hold me

1718
02:00:45,417 --> 02:00:50,411
The way you show me
just what love's

1719
02:00:50,489 --> 02:00:52,719
Made of

1720
02:00:52,791 --> 02:00:59,492
It's in the way we make love

1721
02:00:59,565 --> 02:01:03,057
Oh, how I adore you

1722
02:01:03,135 --> 02:01:06,434
Like no one before you

1723
02:01:06,505 --> 02:01:11,272
I love you just the way you are

1724
02:01:11,343 --> 02:01:15,905
It's in the way you want me

1725
02:01:17,850 --> 02:01:23,220
Oh, it's in the way you hold me

1726
02:01:25,457 --> 02:01:30,360
The way you show me
just what love's

1727
02:01:30,429 --> 02:01:32,659
Made of

1728
02:01:32,731 --> 02:01:38,431
It's in the way we make love

1729
02:01:40,105 --> 02:01:46,874
It's just the way you are

1730
02:01:59,425 --> 02:02:04,522
No matter what they tell us

1731
02:02:04,596 --> 02:02:07,793
No matter what they do

1732
02:02:09,768 --> 02:02:14,000
No matter what they teach us

1733
02:02:15,007 --> 02:02:18,306
What we believe is true

1734
02:02:19,778 --> 02:02:25,375
I can't deny what I believe

1735
02:02:25,451 --> 02:02:28,909
I can't be what I'm not

1736
02:02:28,988 --> 02:02:34,187
- I know our love
- I know our love's forever

1737
02:02:34,259 --> 02:02:40,027
- I know
- I know no matter what

1738
02:02:41,266 --> 02:02:44,895
No matter who they follow

1739
02:02:46,405 --> 02:02:49,203
No matter where they've been

1740
02:02:51,543 --> 02:02:56,378
No matter how they judge us

1741
02:02:56,448 --> 02:03:01,283
I'll be everyone you need

1742
02:03:01,353 --> 02:03:06,950
- I can't deny what I believe
- What I believe

1743
02:03:07,026 --> 02:03:10,484
I can't be what I'm not

1744
02:03:10,562 --> 02:03:12,757
I know I'm not

1745
02:03:12,831 --> 02:03:17,325
I know this love's forever

1746
02:03:17,403 --> 02:03:25,037
That's all that matters now
no matter what

1747
02:03:26,545 --> 02:03:30,538
- No, no matter what
- No, no matter

1748
02:03:30,616 --> 02:03:33,551
- That's all that matters to me
- No, no matter what

1749
02:03:33,619 --> 02:03:35,951
No, no matter

1750
02:03:36,021 --> 02:03:38,683
- That's all that matters to me
- No, no matter what

1751
02:03:38,757 --> 02:03:41,089
No, no matter what

1752
02:03:41,160 --> 02:03:43,822
- That's all that matters to me
- No, no matter what

1753
02:03:43,896 --> 02:03:46,057
No, no matter what

1754
02:03:46,131 --> 02:03:49,123
- That's all that matters to me
- No, no matter what

1755
02:03:49,201 --> 02:03:51,431
No, no matter what

1756
02:03:51,503 --> 02:03:54,768
That's all that matters to me
