1
00:00:00,021 --> 00:00:01,404
Previously on <i>Suits...</i>

2
00:00:01,429 --> 00:00:03,853
You're guilty of bribing
a foreign government

3
00:00:03,854 --> 00:00:05,105
to get your pipeline.

4
00:00:05,156 --> 00:00:07,207
Guilty as charged.

5
00:00:07,274 --> 00:00:08,554
You think
you're not replaceable?

6
00:00:08,576 --> 00:00:10,160
I've been doing this
before I met you,

7
00:00:10,244 --> 00:00:13,530
and I'll be doing it long after
I've forgotten all about you.

8
00:00:13,614 --> 00:00:14,664
Please don't do this.

9
00:00:14,749 --> 00:00:17,033
Your beloved associates
are mine.

10
00:00:17,118 --> 00:00:19,669
What you want is
a long, drawn-out trial

11
00:00:19,754 --> 00:00:20,987
that puts our stock
in the toilet.

12
00:00:21,038 --> 00:00:22,122
I'm here to tell you

13
00:00:22,173 --> 00:00:23,623
he's recusing himself
from the case.

14
00:00:23,674 --> 00:00:25,491
So he appointed
a special prosecutor.

15
00:00:25,543 --> 00:00:28,545
I win, you back me
for managing partner.

16
00:00:28,629 --> 00:00:30,463
You want
to take down Jessica.

17
00:00:30,514 --> 00:00:32,215
Yes, I do.

18
00:00:35,136 --> 00:00:37,270
Holy shit.

19
00:00:37,337 --> 00:00:39,723
Was that a good "holy shit"
or a bad "holy shit"?

20
00:00:39,807 --> 00:00:42,008
Harvey, you just told me
that you're planning a coup.

21
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:43,643
Give me a second
to figure that out.

22
00:00:43,694 --> 00:00:46,512
Not a coup.
It's a move.

23
00:00:46,564 --> 00:00:48,031
And when you're done
with your lecture--

24
00:00:48,115 --> 00:00:49,366
No.
No lecture.

25
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:52,902
I just have one question.

26
00:00:52,987 --> 00:00:56,156
Do I get my own office?

27
00:00:56,207 --> 00:00:57,657
Harvey, if you want
to be managing partner

28
00:00:57,708 --> 00:00:59,075
and Darby
agreed to back you,

29
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,627
then I'll follow you
to the ends of the earth.

30
00:01:00,694 --> 00:01:02,746
But before we start,
I want to make sure

31
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:04,631
you're ready to do this
to Jessica.

32
00:01:04,698 --> 00:01:06,633
I am.

33
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:10,970
Then let's go beat the shit
out of Cameron Dennis.

34
00:01:11,038 --> 00:01:12,472
I know you don't want
to see me.

35
00:01:12,539 --> 00:01:14,307
And yet--

36
00:01:14,374 --> 00:01:15,725
I just wanted
to let you know that I got

37
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:18,044
a copy of the letter that
Jessica blackmailed me with,

38
00:01:18,095 --> 00:01:19,545
and I made it clear to her
that I would take it

39
00:01:19,597 --> 00:01:21,431
to the D.A.
if she ever threatened me,

40
00:01:21,515 --> 00:01:23,016
so what I did
will never happen again.

41
00:01:23,067 --> 00:01:25,551
Never should have happened
in the first place.

42
00:01:25,603 --> 00:01:26,719
Close the door
on your way out.

43
00:01:26,771 --> 00:01:29,722
Donna and I
have work to do.

44
00:01:34,728 --> 00:01:38,198
There's a harsh reality
I need to inform you of,

45
00:01:38,249 --> 00:01:40,667
and it's a bitter pill
to swallow.

46
00:01:40,734 --> 00:01:43,736
But the truth is,
a mistake was made.

47
00:01:43,788 --> 00:01:45,705
A fatal mistake.

48
00:01:45,756 --> 00:01:47,907
And as much
as I hate to admit it,

49
00:01:47,958 --> 00:01:51,678
our time together is done.

50
00:01:51,745 --> 00:01:54,347
No more work,

51
00:01:54,414 --> 00:01:56,516
no more laughter.

52
00:01:56,583 --> 00:01:58,802
Remember?

53
00:02:00,187 --> 00:02:01,187
No more mentorship

54
00:02:01,255 --> 00:02:05,141
and, um, no more anything.

55
00:02:05,226 --> 00:02:08,194
See, I reached too high,
and I fell.

56
00:02:08,262 --> 00:02:10,363
And my punishment is the end
of my tenure

57
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:13,116
as head of the associates.

58
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,985
So I would like to leave you

59
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:18,488
with the immortal sentiment

60
00:02:18,572 --> 00:02:21,574
of Robin Williams.

61
00:02:21,625 --> 00:02:23,827
There have been
other associates before you.

62
00:02:23,911 --> 00:02:26,946
They believed they
were destined for great things,

63
00:02:26,997 --> 00:02:28,331
just like you.

64
00:02:28,415 --> 00:02:33,169
If you just listen,

65
00:02:33,254 --> 00:02:37,090
you can hear 'em whisper
their legacy to you.

66
00:02:37,141 --> 00:02:39,425
Carpe diem.

67
00:02:41,479 --> 00:02:44,180
Seize the day, people.

68
00:02:44,265 --> 00:02:47,267
Make your legal lives
extraordinary.

69
00:02:47,318 --> 00:02:49,519
Oh, Captain,
my Captain.

70
00:02:53,741 --> 00:02:55,158
There was a time
I would've been relieved

71
00:02:55,242 --> 00:02:58,411
to see that--
no more Louis.

72
00:02:58,478 --> 00:02:59,445
It's just wrong.

73
00:02:59,497 --> 00:03:01,147
This whole merger
is wrong.

74
00:03:01,198 --> 00:03:03,149
How'd it go with Harvey?

75
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,200
It didn't.

76
00:03:04,285 --> 00:03:05,151
Did you tell him
about Jessica?

77
00:03:05,202 --> 00:03:07,754
Yeah.
He didn't care.

78
00:03:09,623 --> 00:03:10,790
What?

79
00:03:10,841 --> 00:03:13,092
I just wish I could give you
a hug right now,

80
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,929
but I can't because we still
want to keep us quiet.

81
00:03:15,996 --> 00:03:17,997
Well, come on.
You can give me a hug.

82
00:03:18,048 --> 00:03:19,599
Something could've happened.

83
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:22,519
Something bad,
like a...

84
00:03:22,603 --> 00:03:23,553
My dog could've died.

85
00:03:23,637 --> 00:03:25,188
Oh, you have a dog now?

86
00:03:25,272 --> 00:03:28,141
I was really close
to this dog.

87
00:03:28,192 --> 00:03:30,193
Well, the best way
to get over the death of a dog

88
00:03:30,277 --> 00:03:31,644
is to get a new one.
Mmmm.

89
00:03:31,695 --> 00:03:32,979
- No?
- No.

90
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:34,347
I'm just--I'm just too upset.

91
00:03:34,398 --> 00:03:36,366
I'm--I don't know
if I'm ready

92
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:38,902
for a new fake dog
right now.

93
00:03:38,986 --> 00:03:40,036
- Okay.
- Yeah.

94
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,038
Just leave me
like this.

95
00:03:46,716 --> 00:03:49,835
How did it go?

96
00:03:52,839 --> 00:03:55,274
I don't know.
Awful.

97
00:03:55,341 --> 00:03:56,892
Probably the hardest thing
I ever had to do.

98
00:03:56,976 --> 00:03:58,193
Louis, we just merged,

99
00:03:58,278 --> 00:04:01,196
and I wish I could undo
you losing the associates,

100
00:04:01,281 --> 00:04:02,781
but I can't.

101
00:04:02,849 --> 00:04:04,233
What I can do

102
00:04:04,317 --> 00:04:06,652
is take
what you've been giving

103
00:04:06,703 --> 00:04:09,204
to so many for so long

104
00:04:09,289 --> 00:04:11,073
and have you channel it
into one.

105
00:04:11,157 --> 00:04:12,958
You mean...

106
00:04:13,025 --> 00:04:15,961
I want you to mentor
your own associate.

107
00:04:19,833 --> 00:04:21,333
Finally.

108
00:04:21,384 --> 00:04:25,370
The D'Artagnan to my Athos,
Porthos, and Aramis.

109
00:04:25,422 --> 00:04:27,589
All for one
and one for all.

110
00:04:27,674 --> 00:04:29,925
<i>En garde!</i>

111
00:04:30,009 --> 00:04:32,344
Sorry.

112
00:04:32,395 --> 00:04:35,397
Jessica, wait.

113
00:04:35,482 --> 00:04:37,316
I can have anyone?

114
00:04:37,383 --> 00:04:39,902
Louis, take your pick
of the litter.

115
00:04:44,324 --> 00:04:46,191
- Good morning, Ms. Paulsen.
- Spit it out.

116
00:04:46,242 --> 00:04:47,659
Is that any way to start
the day?

117
00:04:47,727 --> 00:04:49,111
You want something.

118
00:04:49,195 --> 00:04:50,362
I need the 411
on the breakup.

119
00:04:50,413 --> 00:04:52,414
- Are we in high school?
- Life is high school.

120
00:04:52,499 --> 00:04:53,565
And I need to know
if the prom king

121
00:04:53,616 --> 00:04:55,918
and his boy wonder
are still an item.

122
00:04:56,002 --> 00:04:57,202
What high school
did you go to?

123
00:04:57,236 --> 00:04:58,954
Donna,
it's a simple question.

124
00:04:59,038 --> 00:05:01,290
Did Mike and Harvey
<i>break up</i> break up,

125
00:05:01,374 --> 00:05:04,042
or did they take a time-out
and, like, say to each other,

126
00:05:04,094 --> 00:05:06,545
"hey, let's see other people
and make sure that we're sure."

127
00:05:06,596 --> 00:05:09,047
I see what's going on here.

128
00:05:09,099 --> 00:05:10,466
Jessica feels sorry
for you,

129
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:11,884
so she's given you
your pick of the liter.

130
00:05:11,935 --> 00:05:13,251
And now you're sniffing
around here,

131
00:05:13,303 --> 00:05:15,270
trying to put the moves on Mike
behind Harvey's back.

132
00:05:15,355 --> 00:05:17,315
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
I would never do that.

133
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:19,475
No, that's why I'm here
to ask permission.

134
00:05:19,559 --> 00:05:20,926
So ask him.

135
00:05:20,977 --> 00:05:21,977
Well, I think
it might go better

136
00:05:22,061 --> 00:05:23,028
coming
from a different source.

137
00:05:23,095 --> 00:05:24,897
- You want me to ask him.
- Yeah.

138
00:05:24,948 --> 00:05:25,931
Would you please?
No.

139
00:05:25,982 --> 00:05:27,032
Why?

140
00:05:27,099 --> 00:05:28,033
Because it would be
so much more fun

141
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:30,736
for me to listen to you
ask him.

142
00:05:30,787 --> 00:05:31,820
Well, let me
get this straight.

143
00:05:31,905 --> 00:05:33,489
You want my permission
to take Mike

144
00:05:33,573 --> 00:05:35,207
and force him to be
your associate.

145
00:05:35,274 --> 00:05:36,992
No, I would never force him
to do anything.

146
00:05:37,076 --> 00:05:38,160
It has to be consensual.

147
00:05:38,244 --> 00:05:41,446
Not like Sally Jones
and senior prom.

148
00:05:41,498 --> 00:05:43,415
Wait a second.
Did you just admit to a crime?

149
00:05:43,466 --> 00:05:45,751
No, a crime was committed
upon me.

150
00:05:45,802 --> 00:05:47,953
Okay, I don't want to,
but I have to.

151
00:05:48,004 --> 00:05:49,805
What crime?

152
00:05:49,889 --> 00:05:52,958
My mom felt bad for Sally,
so she forced me to take her.

153
00:05:53,009 --> 00:05:56,562
Well, what was so bad
about her?

154
00:05:56,629 --> 00:06:00,399
She had four nipples.

155
00:06:00,466 --> 00:06:02,568
Okay, if that date
was so bad,

156
00:06:02,635 --> 00:06:04,937
I mean,
how did you find that out?

157
00:06:04,988 --> 00:06:05,938
Okay, you know what,
Harvey,

158
00:06:05,989 --> 00:06:07,573
do I have your blessing
or not?

159
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,107
Knock yourself out,
Louis.

160
00:06:09,159 --> 00:06:10,692
See, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

161
00:06:10,777 --> 00:06:12,744
You're just saying that because
you think he's gonna say no.

162
00:06:12,812 --> 00:06:15,614
- Oh, I know he'll say no.
- Well, I know you're wrong.

163
00:06:15,665 --> 00:06:16,648
So you better think
about this very carefully,

164
00:06:16,699 --> 00:06:18,500
because once permission
is given,

165
00:06:18,585 --> 00:06:20,986
you cannot go back.

166
00:06:21,037 --> 00:06:22,671
Speak now,
or forever hold your peace.

167
00:06:22,755 --> 00:06:25,156
Fine.
He's yours.

168
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:27,509
I'm sure you two
will be very happy together.

169
00:06:27,594 --> 00:06:30,212
Good, 'cause
when I'm done with him,

170
00:06:30,296 --> 00:06:34,600
Mike Ross will be begging
to be my associate.

00:07:08,464 --> 00:07:10,926
Well, well,
what a surprise.

182
00:07:11,162 --> 00:07:12,412
Jessica.

183
00:07:12,496 --> 00:07:13,863
Last time we saw each other,

184
00:07:13,914 --> 00:07:15,949
you were blackmailing me
out of my job.

185
00:07:16,033 --> 00:07:17,500
Here to do it again?

186
00:07:17,568 --> 00:07:18,952
Because you gave me
what you had on me.

187
00:07:19,036 --> 00:07:20,587
I just want
to make one thing clear.

188
00:07:20,671 --> 00:07:23,906
What I did to you,
I did to you.

189
00:07:23,958 --> 00:07:25,039
Don't take it out
on Harvey.

190
00:07:25,075 --> 00:07:27,076
Oh, that's sweet.

191
00:07:27,128 --> 00:07:29,078
Like a mother
protecting her cub.

192
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:31,247
Take me on
anytime you want,

193
00:07:31,299 --> 00:07:33,133
but don't punish
Harvey's client

194
00:07:33,217 --> 00:07:34,434
for what I did.

195
00:07:34,518 --> 00:07:36,419
You did?

196
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:39,806
You just happened on evidence
from his time

197
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:42,475
at the D.A.'s office?

198
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,728
Oh.

199
00:07:44,779 --> 00:07:47,096
Ah.
The redhead.

200
00:07:47,148 --> 00:07:48,448
Well, it doesn't matter,

201
00:07:48,532 --> 00:07:50,700
because he may not have been
the one to betray me,

202
00:07:50,768 --> 00:07:52,068
but he didn't stop it.

203
00:07:52,119 --> 00:07:54,070
So after you threw him
under the bus and I saved him,

204
00:07:54,121 --> 00:07:55,822
he should have thrown himself
back under the bus?

205
00:07:55,906 --> 00:07:57,207
You just don't get it.

206
00:07:57,274 --> 00:07:58,608
Yes, I do.

207
00:07:58,659 --> 00:07:59,876
What you're really pissed at

208
00:07:59,943 --> 00:08:01,944
is that he chose me
over you.

209
00:08:01,996 --> 00:08:03,463
Not you.
What you are.

210
00:08:03,547 --> 00:08:04,947
I put bad guys away.

211
00:08:04,999 --> 00:08:06,115
You try to figure out

212
00:08:06,167 --> 00:08:07,167
how to let them do
whatever they want.

213
00:08:07,251 --> 00:08:08,551
So don't come in here
telling me

214
00:08:08,619 --> 00:08:11,471
that I'm taking something out
on Harvey's client,

215
00:08:11,555 --> 00:08:13,289
because I'll tell you
something--

216
00:08:13,341 --> 00:08:16,292
she did this.

217
00:08:19,797 --> 00:08:21,014
You made me a mixed tape.

218
00:08:21,098 --> 00:08:23,633
Watch it,
and then make me an offer,

219
00:08:23,684 --> 00:08:25,235
which I'll reject
because...

220
00:08:25,302 --> 00:08:27,987
I got your client
dead to rights.

221
00:08:32,326 --> 00:08:35,495
Mmm, mmm.

222
00:08:35,579 --> 00:08:36,813
Well?

223
00:08:36,864 --> 00:08:39,249
This is the best steak
I've ever had in my life.

224
00:08:39,316 --> 00:08:41,201
That is the best steak
you <i>will</i> ever have

225
00:08:41,285 --> 00:08:42,535
in your life.

226
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:44,087
As much as I appreciate
for once

227
00:08:44,154 --> 00:08:47,173
not having to eat my lunch
from the hot dog stand,

228
00:08:47,258 --> 00:08:48,425
what are we doing here?

229
00:08:48,492 --> 00:08:50,844
Can't a man
just take out another man

230
00:08:50,928 --> 00:08:52,662
in the middle of the day
for some steak and some wine

231
00:08:52,713 --> 00:08:55,432
and some cheesecake that's
gonna knock your socks off?

232
00:08:55,499 --> 00:08:57,300
Uh, some men could.

233
00:08:57,351 --> 00:09:00,019
But I think you and I
both know

234
00:09:00,104 --> 00:09:01,471
that you are not one
of those men.

235
00:09:01,522 --> 00:09:03,022
- True that.
- Mm.

236
00:09:03,107 --> 00:09:04,023
Want some more wine?

237
00:09:04,108 --> 00:09:05,358
Don't mind if I do.

238
00:09:05,443 --> 00:09:06,443
And you gotta
try this cheesecake.

239
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:08,561
Oh, no, Louis, I'm--
mm--

240
00:09:08,646 --> 00:09:10,196
You know what I mean, right?
What do you think of that?

241
00:09:10,281 --> 00:09:11,848
Hey, Louis! How was the steak?

242
00:09:11,899 --> 00:09:13,116
- Heaven.
- How about you?

243
00:09:13,183 --> 00:09:14,534
Best steak you ever had?

244
00:09:14,618 --> 00:09:17,320
Uh, best steak
I <i>will</i> ever have.

245
00:09:17,371 --> 00:09:18,688
You taught him well.

246
00:09:18,739 --> 00:09:20,373
What are you guys,
brothers?

247
00:09:21,492 --> 00:09:22,575
Oh, I'm just kidding.

248
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:24,527
Louis here's got
a lovely sister, Esther,

249
00:09:24,578 --> 00:09:25,662
two wonderful parents.

250
00:09:25,713 --> 00:09:26,913
Who the hell are you?

251
00:09:26,997 --> 00:09:29,799
I am Mike Ross.
Louis and I work together.

252
00:09:29,867 --> 00:09:31,668
I wanted him to know
who he was working for.

253
00:09:31,719 --> 00:09:33,035
- Oh.
- And I would like you to know

254
00:09:33,087 --> 00:09:34,137
who's working for you.

255
00:09:34,204 --> 00:09:35,472
'Cause Mike here,

256
00:09:35,539 --> 00:09:36,840
he's the best steak
you'll ever have.

257
00:09:36,891 --> 00:09:38,374
You want to know
what you're working for?

258
00:09:38,426 --> 00:09:42,145
Tina, Gina, Adrian.

259
00:09:42,212 --> 00:09:43,646
They've been here 50 years
between them.

260
00:09:43,714 --> 00:09:47,100
They are my family.

261
00:09:47,184 --> 00:09:50,653
That's
what you're working for.

262
00:09:50,721 --> 00:09:52,655
II understand.

263
00:09:55,609 --> 00:09:57,777
I do not understand.

264
00:09:57,862 --> 00:09:58,912
Eminent domain.

265
00:09:58,996 --> 00:10:00,997
- Shit.
- Final hearing's Tuesday.

266
00:10:01,064 --> 00:10:03,500
If we don't win, this place
becomes a shopping center.

267
00:10:03,567 --> 00:10:04,734
Then this place
becomes a shopping center,

268
00:10:04,785 --> 00:10:06,753
because nobody wins
eminent domain cases.

269
00:10:06,837 --> 00:10:09,422
But what if we did,
Mike?

270
00:10:09,507 --> 00:10:10,590
Then he'd get to keep
his restaurant.

271
00:10:10,674 --> 00:10:13,042
He would get to keep
his dream,

272
00:10:13,093 --> 00:10:17,547
and I would get to keep
my dream.

273
00:10:17,598 --> 00:10:20,099
- And what is that?
- To rewrite the law.

274
00:10:20,184 --> 00:10:21,134
And the way to do that

275
00:10:21,218 --> 00:10:22,602
is to win
an un-winnable case.

276
00:10:22,686 --> 00:10:24,604
What do you need me to do?

277
00:10:27,391 --> 00:10:28,525
You went to see Cameron?

278
00:10:28,592 --> 00:10:30,193
I was just coming
to apologize.

279
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:31,300
For interfering
on my case.

280
00:10:31,362 --> 00:10:32,428
He's pissed at you.

281
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,613
He's going to take it out
on Ava.

282
00:10:33,697 --> 00:10:34,814
I wanted to let him know
the person

283
00:10:34,899 --> 00:10:36,366
he should be pissed at
is me.

284
00:10:36,433 --> 00:10:37,367
Well,
it's not gonna stop him

285
00:10:37,434 --> 00:10:38,868
from taking it out
on Ava.

286
00:10:38,936 --> 00:10:40,153
Which is why
I was coming to apologize.

287
00:10:40,237 --> 00:10:41,237
Are you also going
to apologize

288
00:10:41,288 --> 00:10:42,989
for sending the message
that I need you

289
00:10:43,073 --> 00:10:44,707
to help me fight
my battles for me?

290
00:10:44,775 --> 00:10:45,909
I don't want
to fight Cameron for you.

291
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,710
I want to fight Cameron
with you.

292
00:10:47,778 --> 00:10:49,128
When the evidence
is stacked against you,

293
00:10:49,213 --> 00:10:51,714
you do what O.J. did--
you hire the dream team.

294
00:10:51,782 --> 00:10:53,800
Oh, that's our bar?
O.J.?

295
00:10:53,884 --> 00:10:56,386
Did he walk or not?

296
00:10:56,453 --> 00:10:57,387
Fine.

297
00:10:57,454 --> 00:10:59,973
But I'm Johnnie Cochran.

298
00:11:02,643 --> 00:11:03,593
You know.

299
00:11:03,644 --> 00:11:04,677
You know I know.

300
00:11:04,762 --> 00:11:05,845
Mike told me.

301
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:07,296
Nobody had to tell me
after you sent me

302
00:11:07,348 --> 00:11:09,632
on that wild goose chase
after <i>American Gigolo.</i>

303
00:11:09,683 --> 00:11:10,817
Oh, I'm sorry.

304
00:11:10,901 --> 00:11:12,402
You know, it's not
that you violated

305
00:11:12,469 --> 00:11:13,970
the sanctity
of our friendship.

306
00:11:14,021 --> 00:11:17,139
It's that you violated
the sanctity of Richard Gere--

307
00:11:17,191 --> 00:11:18,241
something
I would like to do,

308
00:11:18,308 --> 00:11:19,692
but not the way
you did it.

309
00:11:19,777 --> 00:11:21,861
Look, I was just trying
to get Mike back with Harvey.

310
00:11:21,946 --> 00:11:23,246
I understand.

311
00:11:23,313 --> 00:11:24,981
Because I never want
their thing to be our thing.

312
00:11:25,032 --> 00:11:26,199
It's not.

313
00:11:26,283 --> 00:11:27,917
And the way to keep it
from becoming our thing

314
00:11:27,985 --> 00:11:29,619
is to stop talking about them.
Done.

315
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:32,121
So you and Mike.

316
00:11:32,172 --> 00:11:33,756
I know.
It's a lot.

317
00:11:33,824 --> 00:11:34,791
Do you want to talk
about it?

318
00:11:34,842 --> 00:11:36,092
Of course I do.

319
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:37,377
Okay, I think
we should start

320
00:11:37,461 --> 00:11:39,512
with the most important
emotional question.

321
00:11:39,597 --> 00:11:42,048
Okay.

322
00:11:45,803 --> 00:11:47,103
I'm actually
getting worried for you.

323
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:48,330
You don't know
the half of it.

324
00:11:55,563 --> 00:11:57,780
Louis, you said 5:00.
It's only 4:30.

325
00:11:57,848 --> 00:11:59,566
I've been here
since we ate.

326
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:01,367
I've been researching
every eminent domain case

327
00:12:01,452 --> 00:12:02,986
ever tried,
starting with 1905.

328
00:12:03,037 --> 00:12:04,203
Clark v. Nash.

329
00:12:04,288 --> 00:12:05,204
I thought you wanted me
to be doing

330
00:12:05,289 --> 00:12:06,522
the research?
I did.

331
00:12:06,574 --> 00:12:09,826
But if I don't do it too,
how can I help you?

332
00:12:09,877 --> 00:12:10,827
You're helping me?

333
00:12:10,878 --> 00:12:12,194
Yeah.
I help you help me.

334
00:12:12,246 --> 00:12:14,213
That's how it works.

335
00:12:14,298 --> 00:12:15,715
Help me help you.

336
00:12:15,799 --> 00:12:16,966
What?

337
00:12:17,034 --> 00:12:20,369
Help me help--
it's <i>Jerry Maguire.</i>

338
00:12:20,421 --> 00:12:23,006
- Jerry Mc-what?
- You--

339
00:12:23,057 --> 00:12:24,841
okay, if you've gone
over every case file,

340
00:12:24,892 --> 00:12:26,559
then you know
that the reason nobody wins

341
00:12:26,644 --> 00:12:28,544
is because there is no chink
in the armor.

342
00:12:28,596 --> 00:12:31,881
Well, then we make
a chink of our own.

343
00:12:38,739 --> 00:12:40,156
If I'm on a jury,

344
00:12:40,223 --> 00:12:42,158
I'm looking at a bribe,
plain as day.

345
00:12:42,225 --> 00:12:44,160
Because that's exactly
what it is.

346
00:12:44,227 --> 00:12:45,194
I don't care
what it looks like.

347
00:12:45,245 --> 00:12:46,613
There's no audio.

348
00:12:46,697 --> 00:12:47,914
It's our story
versus theirs.

349
00:12:47,998 --> 00:12:49,999
It's a shady deal
and a case full of cash.

350
00:12:50,067 --> 00:12:51,417
Their story is going
to be more compelling.

351
00:12:51,502 --> 00:12:54,253
Cameron's not going
to risk trial without more.

352
00:12:54,338 --> 00:12:56,405
- Do you think he has audio?
- What would it say?

353
00:12:56,457 --> 00:13:00,009
It would have this gentleman,
Colonel Mariga,

354
00:13:00,077 --> 00:13:01,461
asking if we had
the money

355
00:13:01,545 --> 00:13:03,846
and my number two, Nick Howell,
showing it to him.

356
00:13:03,914 --> 00:13:06,082
Then he would thank us
for paying

357
00:13:06,133 --> 00:13:08,051
a pollution remediation fee.

358
00:13:08,102 --> 00:13:10,086
That sounds
environmentally sound.

359
00:13:10,137 --> 00:13:11,354
Except we'd already
remediated everything

360
00:13:11,421 --> 00:13:13,589
that needed
to be remediated.

361
00:13:13,641 --> 00:13:15,475
Which is how you knew
it was a bribe.

362
00:13:15,559 --> 00:13:17,060
- Yes.
- Hmm.

363
00:13:17,111 --> 00:13:18,144
The question is,

364
00:13:18,228 --> 00:13:20,146
did you ever use
that word in that room?

365
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:21,597
I may be brazen,
Mr. Specter,

366
00:13:21,649 --> 00:13:23,032
but I am not a fool.

367
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:25,451
Then the audio
won't help them anyway.

368
00:13:25,536 --> 00:13:27,036
The Colonel?

369
00:13:27,104 --> 00:13:29,706
No, they're still in power.
He's not getting indicted.

370
00:13:35,245 --> 00:13:36,713
What?

371
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:38,498
Cameron's got your protege.

372
00:13:38,582 --> 00:13:40,500
No.

373
00:13:40,584 --> 00:13:42,284
I've been grooming Nick
for ten years.

374
00:13:42,336 --> 00:13:44,170
I've taught him everything
he knows.

375
00:13:44,254 --> 00:13:45,805
Like how to bribe
a foreign government?

376
00:13:45,889 --> 00:13:49,308
That is not the same.
He would never turn on me.

377
00:13:49,393 --> 00:13:50,843
You'd be surprised
what people you trust

378
00:13:50,928 --> 00:13:52,979
would do when someone
puts them in a position

379
00:13:53,063 --> 00:13:56,399
where they think
they don't have a choice.

380
00:13:56,466 --> 00:13:59,736
Harvey's right.

381
00:13:59,803 --> 00:14:01,688
Once someone puts
another person down the path

382
00:14:01,772 --> 00:14:03,806
of bending the law,

383
00:14:03,857 --> 00:14:04,857
people tend to turn
on each other.

384
00:14:04,942 --> 00:14:06,142
You don't know him.

385
00:14:06,193 --> 00:14:08,444
When's the last time
you spoke to him?

386
00:14:08,495 --> 00:14:09,662
A few days ago.

387
00:14:09,747 --> 00:14:11,531
Call him.
He won't take your call.

388
00:14:11,615 --> 00:14:13,116
You're wrong.

389
00:14:13,167 --> 00:14:16,318
He always takes my calls.

390
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:18,171
Hi, it's Nick.
Leave a message.

391
00:14:18,255 --> 00:14:21,207
Let me tell you
what that message really said.

392
00:14:21,291 --> 00:14:22,842
"Hi, Ava.
It's Nick.

393
00:14:22,926 --> 00:14:24,886
"I'm not here right now
because I'm cutting a deal

394
00:14:24,928 --> 00:14:27,046
to sell you out."

395
00:14:32,828 --> 00:14:34,943
- Hey.
- Hey.

396
00:14:35,517 --> 00:14:36,734
How's it going with Louis?

397
00:14:36,819 --> 00:14:39,487
You know,
it's actually not bad.

398
00:14:39,538 --> 00:14:40,705
But the truth is,

399
00:14:40,789 --> 00:14:42,624
I would rather be--

400
00:14:42,691 --> 00:14:43,825
- No.
- What? Come on.

401
00:14:43,876 --> 00:14:45,210
It's the middle
of the night.

402
00:14:45,294 --> 00:14:46,211
Louis could be back
at any minute.

403
00:14:46,295 --> 00:14:47,912
- I can be fast.
- I know.

404
00:14:47,997 --> 00:14:51,365
That was a one-time thing.

405
00:14:54,169 --> 00:14:56,421
Mm, mm, mm.
Enough, enough.

406
00:14:56,505 --> 00:14:58,890
But I--
okay.

407
00:14:58,974 --> 00:15:01,226
Yeah, you're probably right.

408
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:02,760
The last person
we want catching us is Louis.

409
00:15:02,845 --> 00:15:03,895
Did it ever occur to you

410
00:15:03,979 --> 00:15:05,480
that's he's trying
to recruit you?

411
00:15:05,547 --> 00:15:06,681
Can we just
for once assume

412
00:15:06,732 --> 00:15:09,234
that Louis doesn't have
an ulterior motive?

413
00:15:09,318 --> 00:15:12,937
I got us
some refreshments.

414
00:15:13,022 --> 00:15:16,658
I will leave you two
to your work.

415
00:15:16,725 --> 00:15:18,159
- So?
- Yeah.

416
00:15:18,226 --> 00:15:20,061
Louis, it's the middle
of the night.

417
00:15:20,112 --> 00:15:21,228
Where did you get all this?

418
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:24,249
I'm the new quartermaster,
remember?

419
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:25,617
Okay.

420
00:15:25,701 --> 00:15:28,453
Here, check this out.

421
00:15:30,539 --> 00:15:32,757
Whoa, no one's thought
to come at it this way.

422
00:15:32,841 --> 00:15:34,375
Mike, this is outstanding.

423
00:15:34,426 --> 00:15:36,410
I actually got the idea
from a movie.

424
00:15:36,462 --> 00:15:38,913
- <i>Moneyball.</i>
- <i>I thought you hated sports.</i>

425
00:15:38,964 --> 00:15:39,964
<i>Moneyball</i>
<i>isn't about sports.</i>

426
00:15:40,049 --> 00:15:41,170
- It's about math.
- Exactly.

427
00:15:41,216 --> 00:15:43,134
One problem.
It's outside the scope.

428
00:15:43,218 --> 00:15:45,603
- What if it weren't?
- What if I could fly?

429
00:15:45,688 --> 00:15:46,721
Well, I can't help you
with that.

430
00:15:46,772 --> 00:15:47,805
But if we want to get it
in the scope,

431
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:48,940
we just have to get
the other side

432
00:15:49,024 --> 00:15:51,643
to put it there for us.

433
00:16:02,321 --> 00:16:04,372
Morning.

434
00:16:04,439 --> 00:16:06,324
Nice Mustang, Harvey.

435
00:16:06,408 --> 00:16:08,626
I see you're still trying
to be Steve McQueen.

436
00:16:08,711 --> 00:16:09,777
Not trying.

437
00:16:09,828 --> 00:16:11,412
Being.

438
00:16:11,463 --> 00:16:14,281
This is the scene
where he corners the asshole.

439
00:16:14,333 --> 00:16:16,417
Speaking of movies,
did you enjoy

440
00:16:16,468 --> 00:16:17,802
the one that I sent over?

441
00:16:17,886 --> 00:16:20,287
It's not often we get
the whole crime on film.

442
00:16:20,339 --> 00:16:23,508
All you have is a silent film
with no proof of anything.

443
00:16:23,592 --> 00:16:25,093
And by the way, I'm going
to have you sanctioned

444
00:16:25,144 --> 00:16:26,293
for withholding evidence.

445
00:16:26,345 --> 00:16:28,796
I gave you that video
in a timely manner.

446
00:16:28,847 --> 00:16:30,181
You gave us that video,

447
00:16:30,265 --> 00:16:31,683
so we'd take our eyes
off Nick.

448
00:16:31,767 --> 00:16:33,851
Nick who?

449
00:16:33,936 --> 00:16:36,404
The Nick you have stashed
in a hotel room somewhere.

450
00:16:36,471 --> 00:16:37,572
Oh, that Nick.

451
00:16:37,639 --> 00:16:39,073
Now that you mention it,

452
00:16:39,141 --> 00:16:42,493
I probably should put him

453
00:16:42,578 --> 00:16:44,779
on my witness list.

454
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:46,981
I'm a little
out of practice.

455
00:16:47,032 --> 00:16:49,117
Yeah.

456
00:16:49,168 --> 00:16:51,119
There you go.

457
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:53,621
Now...
Why don't you get

458
00:16:53,672 --> 00:16:57,324
that piece of shit
out of my driveway, okay?

459
00:16:59,511 --> 00:17:01,796
The first time
I ever had steak,

460
00:17:01,847 --> 00:17:04,215
it was at Peter's.

461
00:17:04,299 --> 00:17:06,667
I mean,
I'd had steak before...

462
00:17:06,719 --> 00:17:10,104
But I never
<i>had</i> steak before.

463
00:17:10,172 --> 00:17:11,773
But that's not
why I'm here today.

464
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,391
You see,
halfway through the meal,

465
00:17:13,475 --> 00:17:14,609
Peter came
over to my table,

466
00:17:14,676 --> 00:17:17,528
and he asked
how I'd liked it.

467
00:17:17,613 --> 00:17:19,513
He wanted to know
because he cared.

468
00:17:19,565 --> 00:17:21,399
He cared about me.

469
00:17:21,483 --> 00:17:24,235
I don't make friends
very easily,

470
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:26,621
but the second I set foot
in Peter's Steakhouse,

471
00:17:26,688 --> 00:17:29,073
I had made a friend
for life.

472
00:17:29,158 --> 00:17:31,192
And that is how Peter
treats every single person

473
00:17:31,243 --> 00:17:32,293
who walks
through his door.

474
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,711
So I don't care
what they say.

475
00:17:33,796 --> 00:17:36,998
Your Honor,
this is not a public benefit.

476
00:17:37,049 --> 00:17:41,335
Your Honor, I'm...
I'm touched.

477
00:17:41,387 --> 00:17:42,637
He makes me want to run
right over there

478
00:17:42,704 --> 00:17:44,305
and get a steak.

479
00:17:44,372 --> 00:17:46,307
But as for the Supreme Court
decision in Kelo,

480
00:17:46,374 --> 00:17:48,309
public benefit is determined
on a quantitative,

481
00:17:48,376 --> 00:17:50,044
not qualitative basis.

482
00:17:50,095 --> 00:17:51,729
Well, I'm glad
you brought up Kelo,

483
00:17:51,814 --> 00:17:54,315
because we happen to have
some quantitative evidence

484
00:17:54,382 --> 00:17:55,316
right here.

485
00:17:55,383 --> 00:17:57,268
Kelo was decided in 2005.

486
00:17:57,352 --> 00:17:59,020
Eight years later
and still,

487
00:17:59,071 --> 00:18:01,022
nothing has been built
on this land.

488
00:18:01,073 --> 00:18:03,775
No jobs created, no taxes
collected, no money made.

489
00:18:03,859 --> 00:18:05,693
Zero quantitative benefit.

490
00:18:05,744 --> 00:18:08,446
Just because they say
it will be better

491
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:10,164
doesn't mean
it actually will be.

492
00:18:10,232 --> 00:18:13,418
Even if it were true,
we have every right to do it.

493
00:18:13,502 --> 00:18:16,087
The state determines benefit,
not the court,

494
00:18:16,171 --> 00:18:17,538
and until such time
as the law is changed,

495
00:18:17,589 --> 00:18:19,240
you have no authority to affect
the state's determination.

496
00:18:19,291 --> 00:18:20,875
Uh, Your Honor, you can
establish authority today.

497
00:18:20,926 --> 00:18:22,043
There's no basis for that.

498
00:18:22,094 --> 00:18:23,428
You have no choice
but to uphold

499
00:18:23,512 --> 00:18:26,264
the established practice
of eminent domain.

500
00:18:26,348 --> 00:18:28,516
I'm afraid opposing counsel
is right.

501
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:31,803
Demolition begins next week.

502
00:18:33,272 --> 00:18:35,807
I just remembered something
about <i>Moneyball.</i>

503
00:18:35,891 --> 00:18:39,777
The A's never actually
won the World Series.

504
00:18:39,862 --> 00:18:41,428
I'm sorry, Louis.

505
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:42,864
Now is not the time
to be sorry.

506
00:18:42,931 --> 00:18:45,366
What is it the time for?

507
00:18:45,433 --> 00:18:47,235
Get in.

508
00:18:47,286 --> 00:18:49,954
Nah, I think I'm good.

509
00:18:50,038 --> 00:18:52,206
Mike, there's nothing
to be afraid of.

510
00:18:52,274 --> 00:18:54,208
It's just good, clean mud.

511
00:18:54,276 --> 00:18:56,077
That doesn't make
any sense.

512
00:18:56,128 --> 00:18:57,378
Is this about the fact
that I'm in the nude?

513
00:18:57,445 --> 00:18:59,130
Please don't harp on that.

514
00:18:59,214 --> 00:19:00,581
Yeah, I'm just saying,
I know

515
00:19:00,632 --> 00:19:01,799
how the younger generation
gets hung up on that stuff,

516
00:19:01,884 --> 00:19:03,050
but you don't have to worry

517
00:19:03,118 --> 00:19:04,385
because you have
your own self-contained unit.

518
00:19:04,452 --> 00:19:07,388
Okay, if I get in,
will you stop saying words?

519
00:19:16,482 --> 00:19:17,843
You know,
if you go in with boxers,

520
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:19,130
you're not gonna
have them later.

521
00:19:19,151 --> 00:19:22,153
You're gonna have
to go smokeless.

522
00:19:33,031 --> 00:19:35,649
That disloyal piece
of filth.

523
00:19:35,701 --> 00:19:37,251
Believe me,
I know how you feel.

524
00:19:37,319 --> 00:19:38,819
Do you?

525
00:19:38,871 --> 00:19:41,205
Because I've heard you prefer
to work alone.

526
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:43,040
Well, I don't.

527
00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:44,992
I may have been above him
when we started,

528
00:19:45,043 --> 00:19:46,327
but for the last two years,

529
00:19:46,378 --> 00:19:48,462
we worked together
side by side.

530
00:19:48,514 --> 00:19:51,382
I'm not a sentimental person,
but it meant something to me,

531
00:19:51,466 --> 00:19:53,027
and I thought it meant
something to him.

532
00:19:53,051 --> 00:19:56,220
- He deserves to be shot.
- He does.

533
00:19:56,305 --> 00:19:58,439
But I suggest
we promote him instead.

534
00:19:58,506 --> 00:19:59,807
You want to give him
a new title

535
00:19:59,858 --> 00:20:01,275
to keep him
from testifying?

536
00:20:01,343 --> 00:20:04,529
I believe it will require
a substantial raise as well.

537
00:20:04,613 --> 00:20:05,696
You know
that's not what I meant.

538
00:20:05,781 --> 00:20:07,114
You're suggesting
bribing a man

539
00:20:07,182 --> 00:20:08,482
to get you
out of your bribery charge.

540
00:20:08,534 --> 00:20:10,818
"In for a penny,
in for a pound,"

541
00:20:10,869 --> 00:20:12,320
mother always said.

542
00:20:12,371 --> 00:20:14,789
This is
what Cameron wanted.

543
00:20:14,856 --> 00:20:17,041
He didn't give us that video
so we wouldn't find Nick.

544
00:20:17,125 --> 00:20:19,327
He gave us Nick,
so you'd try to bribe him.

545
00:20:19,378 --> 00:20:21,078
Well,
how can you know that?

546
00:20:21,163 --> 00:20:22,863
Because Cameron knows
people are who they are.

547
00:20:22,915 --> 00:20:25,032
You bribed once,
you'll bribe again.

548
00:20:25,083 --> 00:20:26,384
Well, then what are you
suggesting I do?

549
00:20:26,468 --> 00:20:27,835
Because I'm going to make
a run at him.

550
00:20:27,886 --> 00:20:31,923
No, I'm gonna
make a run at him.

551
00:20:37,262 --> 00:20:39,564
Louis.

552
00:20:39,648 --> 00:20:41,315
Yeah?

553
00:20:41,383 --> 00:20:43,684
This is the best damn mud
I've ever had.

554
00:20:43,735 --> 00:20:46,387
Hey, I--

555
00:20:48,523 --> 00:20:50,441
I know why you picked me
for this case.

556
00:20:50,525 --> 00:20:52,326
I wouldn't have picked you
if you didn't.

557
00:20:52,394 --> 00:20:54,061
If you wanted me to be
your associate,

558
00:20:54,112 --> 00:20:55,947
why didn't you just ask?

559
00:20:56,031 --> 00:20:56,998
Because you would've
said no.

560
00:20:57,065 --> 00:20:59,867
- Louis, come on.
- No, Mike.

561
00:20:59,918 --> 00:21:01,369
I know what people
think of me,

562
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:03,070
and I know
what you think of me.

563
00:21:03,121 --> 00:21:04,571
I knew you'd remember

564
00:21:04,623 --> 00:21:06,007
all the bad things
about working with me.

565
00:21:06,074 --> 00:21:07,625
I just wanted to remind you
of some of the good ones.

566
00:21:07,709 --> 00:21:09,510
I remember
all the good ones,

567
00:21:09,577 --> 00:21:11,262
but I also remember
after those things,

568
00:21:11,346 --> 00:21:12,880
you going back to being

569
00:21:12,931 --> 00:21:14,966
the same Louis I met
the first day of work.

570
00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:17,768
The Louis who fired someone
right in front of my face

571
00:21:17,853 --> 00:21:20,921
for the sole purpose
of teaching me to be afraid.

572
00:21:20,973 --> 00:21:23,858
You're right.

573
00:21:23,925 --> 00:21:27,111
I remember you once said
that my actions matter

574
00:21:27,195 --> 00:21:28,896
and that it's not water
under the bridge.

575
00:21:28,947 --> 00:21:30,698
You've changed me.

576
00:21:30,765 --> 00:21:33,317
You make me want to be
a better man.

577
00:21:33,402 --> 00:21:35,569
Wait, are you saying
I complete you?

578
00:21:35,621 --> 00:21:37,204
You have seen <i>Jerry Maguire.</i>

579
00:21:37,272 --> 00:21:38,706
No, I'm quoting
my cinema hero,

580
00:21:38,773 --> 00:21:40,941
the character of Melvin Udall,
expertly portrayed

581
00:21:40,993 --> 00:21:42,576
by Jack Nicholson
in <i>As Good As It Gets.</i>

582
00:21:42,628 --> 00:21:44,962
- Oh. Never saw it.
- Oh, well, then you're lucky.

583
00:21:45,047 --> 00:21:46,380
Why is that?

584
00:21:46,448 --> 00:21:47,748
Because you can still see it
for the first time.

585
00:21:52,137 --> 00:21:53,170
The first time.

586
00:21:53,255 --> 00:21:54,972
- Yeah.
- That's it, the first time.

587
00:21:55,057 --> 00:21:56,790
- What?
- The judge.

588
00:21:56,842 --> 00:21:58,926
You were making your argument
about the first time.

589
00:21:58,977 --> 00:22:00,857
He wanted to rule in our favor,
but he couldn't.

590
00:22:00,929 --> 00:22:02,897
I know, that's why we need him
to rewrite the law.

591
00:22:02,964 --> 00:22:04,148
No, we don't,
because there's already

592
00:22:04,232 --> 00:22:06,317
a provision in the law
that works for us.

593
00:22:06,401 --> 00:22:07,568
It's in section--
No, no, no, no.

594
00:22:07,635 --> 00:22:10,321
First of all,
I cannot mix work

595
00:22:10,405 --> 00:22:11,906
with mudding, okay?

596
00:22:11,973 --> 00:22:12,907
Let's hit the showers.

597
00:22:12,974 --> 00:22:14,659
I can't wait to stick it

598
00:22:14,743 --> 00:22:16,243
to opposing counsel.

599
00:22:16,311 --> 00:22:18,245
Do you need me to give you
a hand out of there?

600
00:22:24,333 --> 00:22:26,718
I know who you are.

601
00:22:26,803 --> 00:22:28,020
You shouldn't be here.

602
00:22:28,104 --> 00:22:29,938
No, Nick.
You shouldn't be here.

603
00:22:30,006 --> 00:22:30,939
I'd like you to go.

604
00:22:31,007 --> 00:22:33,275
No.
You wouldn't.

605
00:22:33,342 --> 00:22:34,726
You'd like to give me
five minutes

606
00:22:34,811 --> 00:22:36,478
to see if I can get you
out of the box you're in

607
00:22:36,529 --> 00:22:39,481
before you sell your soul.

608
00:22:44,204 --> 00:22:47,573
I didn't want to do this.

609
00:22:47,657 --> 00:22:49,191
You wouldn't let me in
if you did.

610
00:22:49,242 --> 00:22:50,876
I had no choice.

611
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,628
Ava's in trouble
whether I testify or not.

612
00:22:52,695 --> 00:22:54,296
That's what Cameron
wants you to believe.

613
00:22:54,297 --> 00:22:57,332
- You haven't seen the video?
- I saw a business transaction.

614
00:22:57,383 --> 00:22:59,585
- You don't believe that.
- I can sell that.

615
00:22:59,669 --> 00:23:01,220
You just got to keep your head
and shut your mouth.

616
00:23:01,304 --> 00:23:02,337
Just do
what you're here to do.

617
00:23:02,388 --> 00:23:03,639
Threaten me,
or offer me a deal.

618
00:23:03,706 --> 00:23:05,974
- I've considered both.
- Cameron said you would.

619
00:23:06,042 --> 00:23:07,893
Cameron's wrong.

620
00:23:07,977 --> 00:23:09,017
I'm not going to do either

621
00:23:09,045 --> 00:23:11,647
because I think
you care about Ava.

622
00:23:11,714 --> 00:23:13,515
I do.

623
00:23:13,566 --> 00:23:15,601
Then think about this.

624
00:23:15,685 --> 00:23:17,402
Whatever deal
Cameron offered you,

625
00:23:17,487 --> 00:23:19,688
it's based on a lie.
He doesn't have anything.

626
00:23:19,739 --> 00:23:21,723
He's just trying to use
your fear

627
00:23:21,774 --> 00:23:23,275
to pit you against Ava.

628
00:23:23,359 --> 00:23:24,639
Look, I've seen it happen
before,

629
00:23:24,694 --> 00:23:27,196
and the one thing
I can tell you is

630
00:23:27,247 --> 00:23:28,864
you go through with it,
you'll regret it

631
00:23:28,915 --> 00:23:29,998
for the rest of your life.

632
00:23:30,066 --> 00:23:31,833
Because she'll
never forgive me.

633
00:23:31,901 --> 00:23:35,003
Because you'll never
forgive yourself.

634
00:23:37,406 --> 00:23:39,541
Okay, what is so important
that we need

635
00:23:39,592 --> 00:23:41,009
to have
an emergency hearing?

636
00:23:41,077 --> 00:23:43,245
Your Honor, we need to be
heard before demolition starts.

637
00:23:43,296 --> 00:23:44,336
What's he going to do now,

638
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:45,597
tell us
about his first demolition?

639
00:23:45,682 --> 00:23:47,132
It was riveting,
but this has nothing to do that.

640
00:23:47,217 --> 00:23:48,800
Your Honor,
based on the new zoning

641
00:23:48,885 --> 00:23:50,045
put through
for their project,

642
00:23:50,086 --> 00:23:52,054
we're simply asking
for a revised valuation

643
00:23:52,105 --> 00:23:54,806
of the property
that they're taking.

644
00:23:57,527 --> 00:23:58,777
$100 million?

645
00:23:58,861 --> 00:24:00,279
That valuation
has no basis.

646
00:24:00,363 --> 00:24:01,813
It has
a mathematical basis.

647
00:24:01,898 --> 00:24:03,815
Specifically, the present
value of future cash flow,

648
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,100
as shown right there.

649
00:24:05,151 --> 00:24:06,601
Bullshit. You've heard
of voodoo economics.

650
00:24:06,653 --> 00:24:07,953
This is voodoo math.

651
00:24:08,037 --> 00:24:10,238
They're making crazy assumptions
to inflate their value.

652
00:24:10,273 --> 00:24:11,606
Just like Kelo,
but that really

653
00:24:11,658 --> 00:24:13,075
didn't seem to bother you
when it was in your favor.

654
00:24:13,126 --> 00:24:14,543
Your Honor,
this is ludicrous.

655
00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:15,711
They're only picking
that number

656
00:24:15,778 --> 00:24:16,662
because they know
it makes our project

657
00:24:16,746 --> 00:24:18,113
too expensive
to be feasible.

658
00:24:18,164 --> 00:24:19,581
Well, in the words
of opposing counsel,

659
00:24:19,632 --> 00:24:22,834
even if that were true,
we have every right to do it.

660
00:24:25,221 --> 00:24:27,256
Hi, Donna.
I love your dress.

661
00:24:27,307 --> 00:24:28,840
And I love
when you compliment me

662
00:24:28,925 --> 00:24:29,891
before you ask
for something.

663
00:24:29,959 --> 00:24:31,510
You're so insightful.

664
00:24:31,594 --> 00:24:34,012
Look, I know we said
Harvey and Mike's problem

665
00:24:34,097 --> 00:24:36,231
isn't our problem,
but Louis is stealing Mike.

666
00:24:36,299 --> 00:24:37,733
It's not stealing
when someone's available

667
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:38,817
for the taking.

668
00:24:38,901 --> 00:24:40,402
You knew?

669
00:24:40,469 --> 00:24:42,521
When do I not know?

670
00:24:42,605 --> 00:24:44,325
Louis asked
for Harvey's blessing with Mike,

671
00:24:44,407 --> 00:24:45,324
and he gave it.

672
00:24:45,408 --> 00:24:46,575
Why didn't you tell me?

673
00:24:46,642 --> 00:24:47,809
Because we agreed
that their problem

674
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:49,278
isn't our problem.
I know.

675
00:24:49,329 --> 00:24:50,829
But Harvey
doesn't really want this.

676
00:24:50,913 --> 00:24:53,782
- And you know that because--
- Because he can't.

677
00:24:53,833 --> 00:24:55,784
Look, he needs you
to do your Donna thing

678
00:24:55,835 --> 00:24:57,336
and help him get over it.

679
00:24:57,420 --> 00:25:00,589
Harvey listens to me because
I tell him what I believe.

680
00:25:00,656 --> 00:25:03,508
What do you believe?

681
00:25:08,497 --> 00:25:10,299
That Mike betrayed Harvey.

682
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:12,551
- Mike was blackmailed.
- And then he betrayed Harvey.

683
00:25:12,635 --> 00:25:15,103
- Donna, how can you--
- How can I what?

684
00:25:15,171 --> 00:25:16,805
I just spent
the last year hiding

685
00:25:16,856 --> 00:25:18,106
your boyfriend's
double life.

686
00:25:18,174 --> 00:25:19,975
I'd say I'm
a pretty understanding person.

687
00:25:20,026 --> 00:25:21,843
But what I don't understand
is when someone

688
00:25:21,894 --> 00:25:22,861
takes loyalty like that,

689
00:25:22,945 --> 00:25:24,679
and they throw it
in the garbage.

690
00:25:24,731 --> 00:25:28,033
Would you like me
to say that to Harvey?

691
00:25:28,117 --> 00:25:30,736
Sorry I asked.
Won't happen again.

692
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:33,622
- Yeah, that was awesome.
- That was a great job, Mike.

693
00:25:33,689 --> 00:25:35,457
- Thanks, Louis.
- Rachel.

694
00:25:35,524 --> 00:25:38,160
- Looks like you won.
- The judge is ruling tomorrow.

695
00:25:38,211 --> 00:25:40,462
Then what were you
just celebrating?

696
00:25:40,529 --> 00:25:42,297
Well, we were
dead in the water,

697
00:25:42,365 --> 00:25:43,799
and now we have
a fighting chance.

698
00:25:43,866 --> 00:25:47,502
I'm glad.

699
00:25:47,553 --> 00:25:48,670
Is something wrong?

700
00:25:48,721 --> 00:25:51,223
Oh, I just got
into a fight with Donna.

701
00:25:51,307 --> 00:25:52,707
About what?

702
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:53,892
I went to tell her about you
and Louis, and she just--

703
00:25:53,976 --> 00:25:56,011
You went to Donna
about me and Louis?

704
00:25:56,062 --> 00:25:57,763
- I thought she could help.
- You what?

705
00:25:57,847 --> 00:25:59,348
I thought if she knew,
she'd go to Harvey,

706
00:25:59,399 --> 00:26:00,679
and they'd just put
an end to it.

707
00:26:00,716 --> 00:26:01,983
Someone butting in
and telling him what to do

708
00:26:02,051 --> 00:26:03,602
is only going to push him
further away.

709
00:26:03,686 --> 00:26:05,320
I didn't tell him
what to do.

710
00:26:05,388 --> 00:26:07,439
I went to Donna.
If Donna tells him,

711
00:26:07,523 --> 00:26:08,490
all it says is
that I'm too weak

712
00:26:08,557 --> 00:26:09,991
to fight my own battles.

713
00:26:10,059 --> 00:26:12,340
God, if it's coming from you,
that makes it so much worse.

714
00:26:12,395 --> 00:26:14,246
Why?

715
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:15,897
What?

716
00:26:22,422 --> 00:26:24,706
Harvey forbid me
to tell you anything.

717
00:26:24,757 --> 00:26:26,708
You and Harvey
talked about me?

718
00:26:26,759 --> 00:26:28,343
After we went out,
I went to him,

719
00:26:28,411 --> 00:26:29,532
I said I wanted
to tell you--

720
00:26:29,545 --> 00:26:30,929
And he said
I wasn't trustworthy.

721
00:26:31,013 --> 00:26:32,097
It's not that.

722
00:26:32,181 --> 00:26:33,098
He didn't want you
to go out with me.

723
00:26:33,182 --> 00:26:34,299
No, it's not that either.

724
00:26:34,384 --> 00:26:36,385
He didn't have a problem
with us going out, he--

725
00:26:36,436 --> 00:26:40,188
Oh, so it's okay if you
screwed me so long as you lied.

726
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:41,473
Rachel.

727
00:26:41,557 --> 00:26:42,924
Oh, my God.

728
00:26:42,975 --> 00:26:44,476
That's why you cut things
off with me.

729
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:46,278
- I didn't want to lie to you.
- I can't believe him.

730
00:26:46,362 --> 00:26:47,929
Rachel, he didn't
just risk everything

731
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:49,364
he had for me once.

732
00:26:49,432 --> 00:26:51,066
When Jessica found out,
he put everything

733
00:26:51,117 --> 00:26:52,984
he had on the line
for me again.

734
00:26:53,069 --> 00:26:55,203
I hope you know as you
stand here defending him,

735
00:26:55,271 --> 00:26:57,622
he has no intention
of ever forgiving you.

736
00:26:57,707 --> 00:27:00,459
Because I found out when Louis
asked Harvey for his blessing,

737
00:27:00,543 --> 00:27:02,327
he said, "Take him.
He's all yours."

738
00:27:02,412 --> 00:27:03,795
So instead
of getting mad at me

739
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:06,214
for trying to get Harvey
to forgive you,

740
00:27:06,282 --> 00:27:07,215
maybe you should
get pissed at Harvey

741
00:27:07,283 --> 00:27:10,302
and think about moving on.

742
00:27:17,477 --> 00:27:19,311
What the hell
is wrong with you?

743
00:27:19,395 --> 00:27:22,681
I said I was sorry,
I gave back the office,

744
00:27:22,765 --> 00:27:25,267
I helped you with your case,
I even blackmailed Jessica.

745
00:27:25,318 --> 00:27:26,935
Harvey, I get that you
are pissed off at me,

746
00:27:26,986 --> 00:27:28,069
but eventually,

747
00:27:28,137 --> 00:27:29,354
you are going
to have to forgive me.

748
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:31,440
Forgive you for what,
making me hire Katrina?

749
00:27:31,491 --> 00:27:33,808
Getting high on the job
your first week?

750
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:35,577
Betraying me
with Jessica?

751
00:27:35,644 --> 00:27:38,613
Or for telling Rachel
about your secret?

752
00:27:40,533 --> 00:27:42,584
You cut me loose.

753
00:27:42,651 --> 00:27:44,002
Okay?
You fired me.

754
00:27:44,086 --> 00:27:46,037
I was at my lowest point.
She was there for me.

755
00:27:46,122 --> 00:27:47,655
She's still there for me.

756
00:27:47,707 --> 00:27:48,757
Congratulations.

757
00:27:48,824 --> 00:27:50,145
I hope you two
are happy together.

758
00:27:50,176 --> 00:27:51,927
So you're gonna punish me
by giving me to Louis?

759
00:27:51,994 --> 00:27:53,428
Well, let me
tell you something.

760
00:27:53,496 --> 00:27:54,629
It failed.

761
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,515
I actually like
working for Louis.

762
00:27:56,599 --> 00:27:58,600
He makes me feel
like I'm working with him,

763
00:27:58,667 --> 00:28:00,302
not for him.
Well, I'm glad to hear that.

764
00:28:00,353 --> 00:28:02,053
Because I didn't give you
to Louis as punishment,

765
00:28:02,138 --> 00:28:06,725
I gave you to Louis
because you and I are done.

766
00:28:06,809 --> 00:28:09,844
Harvey,
I regret what I did.

767
00:28:09,896 --> 00:28:11,980
But I'm telling you right now,
you're gonna regret this.

768
00:28:12,031 --> 00:28:15,784
Maybe you didn't hear me.

769
00:28:15,851 --> 00:28:18,487
I said you and I...

770
00:28:18,538 --> 00:28:20,855
We're done.

771
00:28:29,031 --> 00:28:32,334
Whatever it is, I'm not really
in the mood right now.

772
00:28:32,385 --> 00:28:35,670
Harvey,
I know how Cameron works.

773
00:28:35,721 --> 00:28:37,305
He's setting something up.

774
00:28:37,373 --> 00:28:38,924
You think
I don't know that?

775
00:28:39,008 --> 00:28:40,875
He's setting Ava up
to bribe Nick.

776
00:28:40,927 --> 00:28:43,645
- Isn't that what you just did?
- No.

777
00:28:43,712 --> 00:28:45,096
I went to him and told him

778
00:28:45,181 --> 00:28:46,598
he'd regret being disloyal
to her.

779
00:28:46,682 --> 00:28:49,234
Something I know
a little bit about.

780
00:28:49,318 --> 00:28:51,219
Harvey, do you know
what started it

781
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:52,988
between the Hatfields
and the McCoys?

782
00:28:53,055 --> 00:28:56,658
I didn't catch the miniseries,
but I heard Costner killed it.

783
00:28:56,725 --> 00:28:57,725
Doesn't matter.

784
00:28:57,777 --> 00:28:58,910
Because whoever
they say started it,

785
00:28:58,995 --> 00:29:00,278
I guarantee you,

786
00:29:00,363 --> 00:29:03,782
the other side says,
"bullshit."

787
00:29:03,866 --> 00:29:06,451
You went to Darby
for this merger behind my back.

788
00:29:06,536 --> 00:29:09,904
And then you picked a fight
with him behind my back.

789
00:29:09,956 --> 00:29:12,290
And then you
blackmailed Mike behind mine.

790
00:29:12,375 --> 00:29:14,009
And I was only able
to do that

791
00:29:14,076 --> 00:29:15,844
because you brought a fraud

792
00:29:15,911 --> 00:29:17,412
into my firm
in the first place.

793
00:29:17,463 --> 00:29:19,130
So you do think
it's my fault?

794
00:29:19,215 --> 00:29:22,968
What I think is
I regret where we are,

795
00:29:23,052 --> 00:29:26,021
and I've been trying to get us
back to where we were.

796
00:29:26,088 --> 00:29:27,856
And what would the evidence
of that be?

797
00:29:27,923 --> 00:29:30,225
What evidence
would you like?

798
00:29:30,276 --> 00:29:31,359
Why don't you
tell me the truth

799
00:29:31,427 --> 00:29:34,262
about why the hell
I'm on this case?

800
00:29:34,313 --> 00:29:36,114
All right, Harvey.

801
00:29:36,198 --> 00:29:37,765
I lied to you.

802
00:29:37,817 --> 00:29:40,952
When I told you I fought
to get you on this case,

803
00:29:41,037 --> 00:29:42,120
I didn't.

804
00:29:42,204 --> 00:29:43,738
Darby made that call.

805
00:29:43,789 --> 00:29:47,208
And I used it as an opportunity
to reach out to you.

806
00:29:47,276 --> 00:29:49,544
- "Used."
- To reach out to you.

807
00:29:49,612 --> 00:29:53,298
Which I am now here doing
without using anything.

808
00:29:53,382 --> 00:29:55,050
So do you want
to let it go or not?

809
00:29:55,117 --> 00:29:56,951
I want to know one thing.

810
00:29:57,003 --> 00:29:58,786
If you had it to do over,

811
00:29:58,838 --> 00:30:01,339
would you do it again?

812
00:30:02,791 --> 00:30:06,728
Deposition's on the books
with Cameron tomorrow.

813
00:30:06,795 --> 00:30:09,731
You want me there or not?

814
00:30:18,573 --> 00:30:20,573
Harvey, I'd introduce
you to Nick,

815
00:30:20,844 --> 00:30:22,705
but I understand
you two already met

816
00:30:22,706 --> 00:30:24,239
when you witness-tampered.

817
00:30:24,291 --> 00:30:25,758
Nick works
for Hessington Oil.

818
00:30:25,842 --> 00:30:26,926
We're their lawyers.

819
00:30:27,010 --> 00:30:28,427
Therefore,
I didn't witness-tamper.

820
00:30:28,512 --> 00:30:29,595
And if you say it again,

821
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,680
I'm gonna slap you
with a slander suit.

822
00:30:30,747 --> 00:30:32,882
Well, let me slap you
with something.

823
00:30:32,933 --> 00:30:35,518
Tony Gianopolous got a hold
of that video somehow,

824
00:30:35,585 --> 00:30:36,919
and he gave it
to your shareholders.

825
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:38,270
They're filing
some sort of lawsuit.

826
00:30:38,355 --> 00:30:39,805
I think he's trying
to take over the company.

827
00:30:39,890 --> 00:30:42,358
You son of a bitch.
You leaked it.

828
00:30:42,425 --> 00:30:43,759
I deny that.

829
00:30:43,810 --> 00:30:45,094
And if your client
says that again,

830
00:30:45,145 --> 00:30:47,480
I will slap her
with a slander suit

831
00:30:47,564 --> 00:30:49,732
to go
alongside her bribery charges.

832
00:30:49,783 --> 00:30:52,334
And by the way,

833
00:30:52,402 --> 00:30:53,569
Nick wasn't swayed

834
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:56,122
by your attempt to tug
at his heartstrings.

835
00:30:56,206 --> 00:30:57,907
Emotional pleas?

836
00:30:57,958 --> 00:30:59,458
What did you do to him,
Jessica?

837
00:30:59,543 --> 00:31:01,160
This is not the kid
I mentored.

838
00:31:01,244 --> 00:31:03,162
Hold on a sec.

839
00:31:03,246 --> 00:31:05,631
You were never my mentor.
Jessica was.

840
00:31:05,716 --> 00:31:08,551
You're just
a fast-talking car salesman

841
00:31:08,618 --> 00:31:11,087
that hides behind the line,
"I do good."

842
00:31:11,138 --> 00:31:14,140
Now get out of my face
while I confer with my client.

843
00:31:19,295 --> 00:31:20,563
You told me
you knew this man.

844
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:22,598
I thought
that was an advantage.

845
00:31:22,649 --> 00:31:24,850
Instead, you've goaded him
into orchestrating

846
00:31:24,935 --> 00:31:26,185
an attempt
to take over my company.

847
00:31:26,269 --> 00:31:28,604
You know
how sometimes the doctor says

848
00:31:28,655 --> 00:31:30,606
you're gonna feel worse
before you feel better?

849
00:31:30,657 --> 00:31:33,308
- What are you saying?
- What he's saying is

850
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:37,279
let us know how you feel
in half an hour.

851
00:31:42,485 --> 00:31:44,670
- Hey.
- Hey.

852
00:31:44,755 --> 00:31:46,005
Do you have a second?

853
00:31:46,089 --> 00:31:47,506
I want to talk to you
about how we left things.

854
00:31:47,591 --> 00:31:50,092
I don't know,
did you run it by Harvey first?

855
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,594
- What?
- I understand

856
00:31:51,661 --> 00:31:54,513
that he has final say on who
his employees fraternize with.

857
00:31:55,766 --> 00:31:57,049
Look.

858
00:31:57,134 --> 00:31:59,552
Harvey wasn't just
trying to protect himself,

859
00:31:59,636 --> 00:32:00,853
Mike, Jessica, and me.

860
00:32:00,937 --> 00:32:02,388
He was also trying
to protect you.

861
00:32:02,472 --> 00:32:05,524
Right, my protection's
at the top of Harvey's agenda.

862
00:32:05,609 --> 00:32:07,610
He barely knows who I am.
Rachel.

863
00:32:07,677 --> 00:32:08,844
And if he did know me,

864
00:32:08,895 --> 00:32:10,312
he would know
that I would never tell anyone.

865
00:32:10,363 --> 00:32:11,397
Okay, look.

866
00:32:11,481 --> 00:32:12,681
You want to be mad
at Harvey, fine.

867
00:32:12,732 --> 00:32:13,983
But you might as well
be mad at me,

868
00:32:14,034 --> 00:32:17,036
because I told Mike
the same thing.

869
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,121
What?

870
00:32:19,189 --> 00:32:20,355
I dragged Mike
into Harvey's office,

871
00:32:20,407 --> 00:32:23,159
and I told him
that Harvey was right.

872
00:32:23,210 --> 00:32:25,360
- That Mike should lie to me?
- No.

873
00:32:25,412 --> 00:32:28,581
I told him
that he should get over you.

874
00:32:34,004 --> 00:32:37,206
Was that before
or after I came to you

875
00:32:37,257 --> 00:32:38,874
and told you
that I kissed him

876
00:32:38,925 --> 00:32:42,094
and that I called him
and told him how I felt?

877
00:32:42,179 --> 00:32:44,180
It was after.

878
00:32:44,231 --> 00:32:45,981
You told him
not to be with me,

879
00:32:46,049 --> 00:32:48,210
and then you let me think
that he didn't care about me.

880
00:32:48,218 --> 00:32:50,903
No,
I told him what I thought,

881
00:32:50,987 --> 00:32:52,104
and then I tried

882
00:32:52,189 --> 00:32:53,709
to help you move on
because their truth

883
00:32:53,723 --> 00:32:54,890
wasn't mine to tell you.

884
00:32:54,941 --> 00:32:55,858
I thought you were my friend.

885
00:32:55,909 --> 00:32:56,942
I am.

886
00:32:57,027 --> 00:32:58,410
You cared more
about protecting Harvey

887
00:32:58,495 --> 00:32:59,445
than protecting me.

888
00:32:59,529 --> 00:33:02,414
Yes, Rachel!
That's my job.

889
00:33:05,001 --> 00:33:09,071
I get that everyone's jobs
are important.

890
00:33:09,122 --> 00:33:11,173
This wasn't about a job
for me.

891
00:33:11,241 --> 00:33:14,126
It was about having a life.

892
00:33:14,211 --> 00:33:17,680
But I guess
you wouldn't understand that.

893
00:33:19,099 --> 00:33:21,467
Rachel...

894
00:33:21,551 --> 00:33:24,803
I'm going to walk away
before you and I can't go back.

895
00:33:29,559 --> 00:33:31,477
It's the second largest
oil deposit found

896
00:33:31,561 --> 00:33:32,945
in the last decade.

897
00:33:33,029 --> 00:33:36,031
We had the contract for it,
but to get it out of the E.I.R.,

898
00:33:36,099 --> 00:33:38,484
we needed the pipeline.
What were you told?

899
00:33:38,568 --> 00:33:39,601
And by whom?

900
00:33:39,653 --> 00:33:41,320
We were told
by Colonel Mariga

901
00:33:41,404 --> 00:33:43,539
we could build the pipeline
if we paid

902
00:33:43,606 --> 00:33:45,708
a pollution remediation fee.
But?

903
00:33:45,775 --> 00:33:46,959
We'd already remediated
everything

904
00:33:47,043 --> 00:33:48,544
that needed
to be remediated.

905
00:33:48,611 --> 00:33:51,914
So what was the fee for?

906
00:33:51,965 --> 00:33:53,465
It was a bribe.

907
00:33:53,550 --> 00:33:55,968
And Ava Hessington
paid this fee

908
00:33:56,052 --> 00:33:58,671
with the full knowledge
that it was a bribe?

909
00:33:58,755 --> 00:34:02,007
Yes, she did.

910
00:34:02,092 --> 00:34:03,642
On this screen here, Nick,

911
00:34:03,727 --> 00:34:06,562
are you sliding
a briefcase full of cash

912
00:34:06,629 --> 00:34:08,514
across the table
to Colonel Mariga?

913
00:34:08,598 --> 00:34:10,933
Yes.

914
00:34:10,984 --> 00:34:13,269
And you were aware
it was a bribe?

915
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,303
Yes, but--

916
00:34:14,354 --> 00:34:17,406
How was Ms. Hessington
as a boss?

917
00:34:17,473 --> 00:34:19,308
She taught me
a great deal.

918
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:21,410
- Did she trust you?
- I believe so.

919
00:34:21,477 --> 00:34:23,445
- Rely on you?
- Yes.

920
00:34:23,496 --> 00:34:24,479
Did she look
over your shoulder

921
00:34:24,531 --> 00:34:25,748
on everything you did?

922
00:34:25,815 --> 00:34:27,449
No.

923
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:28,784
Was she aware
of everything you did?

924
00:34:28,835 --> 00:34:30,485
She was aware of this.

925
00:34:30,537 --> 00:34:32,454
Yet all we have
is your word on that.

926
00:34:32,505 --> 00:34:34,006
So let me get this straight.

927
00:34:34,090 --> 00:34:36,625
She groomed you,
promoted you,

928
00:34:36,676 --> 00:34:39,661
gave you autonomy,
then you engineered a bribe.

929
00:34:39,713 --> 00:34:40,796
And when you got caught,

930
00:34:40,847 --> 00:34:42,765
you cut a deal

931
00:34:42,832 --> 00:34:44,967
to lay that bribe
on your mentor.

932
00:34:45,018 --> 00:34:46,435
Is that correct?

933
00:34:46,502 --> 00:34:47,436
She knew.

934
00:34:47,503 --> 00:34:49,722
Yes.
You claimed that before.

935
00:34:49,806 --> 00:34:52,608
If Ava Hessington
were convicted of this crime,

936
00:34:52,675 --> 00:34:54,115
who would be considered
next in line?

937
00:34:54,177 --> 00:34:55,677
That's speculative.

938
00:34:55,729 --> 00:34:57,229
Is it at all possible
it would be you?

939
00:34:57,314 --> 00:35:00,482
Yes.

940
00:35:00,533 --> 00:35:03,869
Wow, sounds like
you have a lot to lose

941
00:35:03,954 --> 00:35:05,520
and even more to gain.

942
00:35:05,572 --> 00:35:07,122
We're not in court.

943
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:09,491
Your testimony
doesn't help you here.

944
00:35:09,542 --> 00:35:10,826
No, but we wanted
to give you a taste

945
00:35:10,877 --> 00:35:12,361
of what it would be like
in court

946
00:35:12,412 --> 00:35:14,496
when Nick still won't be able
to look her in the eye

947
00:35:14,547 --> 00:35:17,166
when he stabs her
in the back.

948
00:35:21,554 --> 00:35:23,639
We won.

949
00:35:23,706 --> 00:35:25,557
- We did?
- We did.

950
00:35:28,011 --> 00:35:30,346
I just want
to say one thing.

951
00:35:30,397 --> 00:35:31,480
You know,
if Harvey had the power

952
00:35:31,547 --> 00:35:33,382
to become Mariano Rivera,
he would,

953
00:35:33,433 --> 00:35:35,684
because Harvey
doesn't love the law.

954
00:35:35,735 --> 00:35:38,687
It's just his vehicle
for forcing

955
00:35:38,738 --> 00:35:39,778
his will on his opponents,

956
00:35:39,823 --> 00:35:42,024
for winning.

957
00:35:42,075 --> 00:35:43,826
But you see, Mike, that's not
how I feel about the law.

958
00:35:43,893 --> 00:35:46,078
I love the law.

959
00:35:46,162 --> 00:35:47,863
And I'd never trade it
for anything.

960
00:35:47,914 --> 00:35:50,582
I love it too.
I also like winning.

961
00:35:50,667 --> 00:35:53,118
I know.

962
00:35:53,203 --> 00:35:56,088
You know what I think?

963
00:35:56,172 --> 00:35:59,091
I think you're half Harvey
and you're half me.

964
00:35:59,175 --> 00:36:00,843
You've had your time
with him.

965
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:03,128
Now have your time
with me.

966
00:36:08,507 --> 00:36:09,776
You here for an interview?

967
00:36:09,849 --> 00:36:11,099
They let you go already?

968
00:36:11,184 --> 00:36:12,434
You made your point.

969
00:36:12,518 --> 00:36:14,903
If we go to trial,
you eviscerate Nick.

970
00:36:14,987 --> 00:36:16,154
But we still have that video,

971
00:36:16,222 --> 00:36:19,608
she's on it,
and he says she knew.

972
00:36:19,692 --> 00:36:22,360
And you know what?
The truth is I believe him.

973
00:36:22,411 --> 00:36:24,329
And I'll make them
believe him.

974
00:36:24,396 --> 00:36:27,749
Then why are you here?

975
00:36:27,833 --> 00:36:30,001
Nice job, Harvey.
You got me.

976
00:36:30,069 --> 00:36:31,586
They want you
to cut a deal.

977
00:36:31,671 --> 00:36:33,588
Against my recommendation.

978
00:36:33,673 --> 00:36:35,674
I guess they know
what you don't.

979
00:36:35,741 --> 00:36:37,425
You can't beat me.
Here are our terms.

980
00:36:37,510 --> 00:36:39,577
No, here are my terms.

981
00:36:39,629 --> 00:36:41,213
Our original offer stands.

982
00:36:41,264 --> 00:36:43,131
Hessington Oil
pleads no contest,

983
00:36:43,216 --> 00:36:45,050
we pay a $50-million fine,

984
00:36:45,101 --> 00:36:47,886
and all criminal charges
against Ava are dropped.

985
00:36:47,937 --> 00:36:49,754
They were going
to go for that,

986
00:36:49,805 --> 00:36:52,023
but I convinced them
to make one change,

987
00:36:52,091 --> 00:36:53,942
nonnegotiable.

988
00:36:54,026 --> 00:36:57,445
Ava Hessington
doesn't plead no contest.

989
00:36:57,530 --> 00:36:59,698
She pleads guilty.

990
00:36:59,765 --> 00:37:01,233
And you get
to call it a win.

991
00:37:01,284 --> 00:37:03,618
Well, the record
is going to say guilty.

992
00:37:03,703 --> 00:37:05,120
It <i>is</i> a win.

993
00:37:05,204 --> 00:37:07,072
I can beat you,

994
00:37:07,123 --> 00:37:08,790
and I did,

995
00:37:08,874 --> 00:37:10,625
and it's going
to eat you up.

996
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:12,610
Dennis, one.

997
00:37:12,662 --> 00:37:16,715
Specter, zero.

998
00:37:16,782 --> 00:37:19,834
Take it or leave it.

999
00:37:21,254 --> 00:37:23,088
- This deal is bullshit.
- Harvey.

1000
00:37:23,139 --> 00:37:24,889
Cameron can say
what he wants.

1001
00:37:24,957 --> 00:37:26,341
Darby asked you
to take this case.

1002
00:37:26,425 --> 00:37:28,093
No way he doesn't
consider this a win.

1003
00:37:28,144 --> 00:37:30,011
I don't consider it
a win.

1004
00:37:30,096 --> 00:37:31,846
Do you really want to gamble
five years of her life,

1005
00:37:31,931 --> 00:37:33,765
so you can prove
you're better than Cameron?

1006
00:37:33,816 --> 00:37:35,736
You know as well as I do,
he's only offering this

1007
00:37:35,801 --> 00:37:37,485
'cause he knows
he's got a loser.

1008
00:37:37,570 --> 00:37:39,304
It's the exact same deal
we offered

1009
00:37:39,355 --> 00:37:40,855
with one technical change.

1010
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:42,657
Do you know how they enter
a technical knockout

1011
00:37:42,742 --> 00:37:43,775
in the record books?

1012
00:37:43,826 --> 00:37:45,860
As a knockout.

1013
00:37:48,864 --> 00:37:50,832
I would.

1014
00:37:50,916 --> 00:37:52,083
What?

1015
00:37:52,151 --> 00:37:55,287
You asked me before
if I'd do it again.

1016
00:37:55,338 --> 00:37:56,955
I would.

1017
00:37:58,457 --> 00:38:00,008
You put me
in that position again,

1018
00:38:00,092 --> 00:38:02,510
and I'll do
whatever I have to do to win.

1019
00:38:02,595 --> 00:38:04,929
Because we win.

1020
00:38:04,997 --> 00:38:07,682
Are you saying screw
this deal, let's kick his ass?

1021
00:38:07,767 --> 00:38:08,767
No.

1022
00:38:08,834 --> 00:38:10,852
I'm saying take the deal.

1023
00:38:10,936 --> 00:38:13,671
We already did.

1024
00:38:23,149 --> 00:38:24,783
Sorry.

1025
00:38:24,850 --> 00:38:26,517
Me too.

1026
00:38:26,569 --> 00:38:28,019
You were just trying
to help me.

1027
00:38:28,070 --> 00:38:29,237
Yeah, but I shouldn't
have said something

1028
00:38:29,322 --> 00:38:31,823
I knew would hurt you
just to end an argument.

1029
00:38:31,874 --> 00:38:34,492
I don't want
to keep secrets from you.

1030
00:38:34,543 --> 00:38:37,528
You don't have to.

1031
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:40,215
So Louis asked me.

1032
00:38:40,299 --> 00:38:42,250
And what did you say?

1033
00:38:42,335 --> 00:38:44,669
I told him I needed
some time to think about it,

1034
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:47,555
and then
I came straight here.

1035
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:49,758
So you're really
just apologizing

1036
00:38:49,842 --> 00:38:51,676
because you need
my advice.

1037
00:38:51,727 --> 00:38:52,727
Well, I also want sex.

1038
00:38:52,812 --> 00:38:54,095
You can have one
or the other.

1039
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:55,180
I really don't need
any advice.

1040
00:39:07,726 --> 00:39:10,578
It's a good deal, Ava.
Don't second-guess yourself.

1041
00:39:10,663 --> 00:39:14,232
I'm not in the habit
of second-guessing myself.

1042
00:39:14,283 --> 00:39:16,251
No, I just realized
when I get back to London,

1043
00:39:16,335 --> 00:39:18,586
my right hand
is going to be gone.

1044
00:39:18,671 --> 00:39:19,954
Your right hand
sold you out.

1045
00:39:20,039 --> 00:39:21,005
You made it
seem like he did it

1046
00:39:21,073 --> 00:39:22,207
for his own personal gain,

1047
00:39:22,258 --> 00:39:24,843
but he did it
for his own survival.

1048
00:39:24,910 --> 00:39:26,044
He still did it.

1049
00:39:26,095 --> 00:39:27,078
But that doesn't mean

1050
00:39:27,129 --> 00:39:30,098
I'm not going to miss him.

1051
00:39:33,519 --> 00:39:35,470
Good-bye, Harvey.

1052
00:39:35,554 --> 00:39:37,255
Goodbye, Ava.

1053
00:39:42,978 --> 00:39:44,696
Do you want me
to send a copy to Darby?

1054
00:39:44,763 --> 00:39:46,564
I do.

1055
00:39:46,615 --> 00:39:47,932
I thought maybe
working with Jessica

1056
00:39:47,983 --> 00:39:49,451
would change your mind
about taking over the firm.

1057
00:39:49,535 --> 00:39:51,953
- It didn't.
- Why not?

1058
00:39:52,037 --> 00:39:53,488
Because if she had it
to do all over again,

1059
00:39:53,572 --> 00:39:55,940
she would.

1060
00:39:57,910 --> 00:39:58,827
Harvey,
if this whole thing

1061
00:39:58,911 --> 00:40:01,112
is really Jessica's fault,

1062
00:40:01,163 --> 00:40:04,449
maybe it's time
we considered forgiving Mike.

1063
00:40:10,506 --> 00:40:12,390
If she's not vacuuming
properly, then just fire her.

1064
00:40:12,458 --> 00:40:13,558
It doesn't matter.

1065
00:40:13,625 --> 00:40:14,559
You'll get someone--

1066
00:40:14,626 --> 00:40:16,644
Mom, I gotta go.
Bye.

1067
00:40:20,683 --> 00:40:22,467
You make me want
to be a better man.

1068
00:40:22,518 --> 00:40:25,153
- You watched it?
- Loved it.

1069
00:40:25,237 --> 00:40:28,323
Well, you had me
at hello.

1070
00:40:28,407 --> 00:40:30,909
You watched
<i>Jerry Maguire?</i>

1071
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:32,694
Jerry, did you know
the human head weighs 8 pounds?

1072
00:40:32,778 --> 00:40:34,412
These are the A.B.C.s
of me, baby!

1073
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:37,148
Show me the money!

1074
00:40:39,418 --> 00:40:40,785
Ahh.

1075
00:40:40,836 --> 00:40:42,620
You know, normally, I wouldn't
want to jinx anything,

1076
00:40:42,671 --> 00:40:44,155
but I got us something.
Okay.

1077
00:40:44,206 --> 00:40:45,490
The perfect way to consummate
our relationship.

1078
00:40:45,541 --> 00:40:46,508
So just wait right here.
It's in the kitchen.

1079
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:48,510
Sure.

1080
00:40:59,855 --> 00:41:03,191
I can't let you do this.

1081
00:41:05,311 --> 00:41:06,511
Let me?

1082
00:41:06,562 --> 00:41:08,863
Don't do this.

1083
00:41:11,484 --> 00:41:15,153
I already said yes.

1084
00:41:15,204 --> 00:41:16,788
I can't go back
on my word.

1085
00:41:16,855 --> 00:41:19,707
You're not going back
on your word.

1086
00:41:19,792 --> 00:41:22,126
You're going back
where you belong.

1087
00:41:26,882 --> 00:41:28,383
I am.

1088
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:34,038
I am sorry.

1089
00:41:34,089 --> 00:41:35,706
I know.

1090
00:41:35,758 --> 00:41:39,177
Look, why don't you
take tonight off

1091
00:41:39,228 --> 00:41:42,230
and go out
with your girlfriend?

1092
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:53,274
Thanks, Harvey.

1093
00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:55,159
No, we're going up top.

1094
00:41:55,227 --> 00:41:56,744
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

1095
00:41:56,829 --> 00:41:59,747
But if you come in
late tomorrow, you're fired.

1096
00:41:59,832 --> 00:42:01,366
We'll see.

1097
