00:10:16,874 --> 00:10:20,458
Well, he can't, can he?
Not if we get to him first.

169
00:10:23,339 --> 00:10:26,752
Are you telling me you saw him
take the cellar key?

170
00:10:26,968 --> 00:10:28,636
Not exactly. But I saw him in here

171
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,712
and I thought the key was swinging
on its hook.

172
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:35,596
I just wondered if you'd noticed
if any of the wine was missing?

173
00:10:42,652 --> 00:10:46,737
I think I owe you an apology
after the way I spoke at dinner.

174
00:10:48,074 --> 00:10:50,492
Next time you want to treat me
like a naughty schoolgirl

175
00:10:50,576 --> 00:10:53,614
you might do it in private,
not in front of the servants.

176
00:10:53,746 --> 00:10:55,112
You're right. I'm sorry.

177
00:10:55,249 --> 00:10:59,334
Of course, it gave your mother
her best evening since Christmas.

178
00:10:59,795 --> 00:11:03,083
Even so, we must try
to keep control of Sybil.

179
00:11:03,424 --> 00:11:07,918
Robert, believe me,
Sybil is not your problem.

180
00:11:09,264 --> 00:11:12,723
We've got to support Mary this year,
when we get to London.

181
00:11:12,809 --> 00:11:16,928
But it's Sybil's first season.
We can't have Mary stealing her thunder.

182
00:11:17,022 --> 00:11:20,890
Sybil will do well enough.
It's time Mary was settled.

183
00:11:21,902 --> 00:11:23,438
High time.

184
00:11:24,989 --> 00:11:28,323
Poor old Edith.
We never seem to talk about her.

185
00:11:28,784 --> 00:11:32,948
I'm afraid Edith will be the one
to care for us in our old age.

186
00:11:34,081 --> 00:11:35,914
What a ghastly prospect.

187
00:11:37,461 --> 00:11:40,203
Mama? Anna said you wanted me.

188
00:11:40,297 --> 00:11:42,038
Look who's paid us a visit.

189
00:11:42,132 --> 00:11:44,999
Sir Anthony. How nice.

190
00:11:45,635 --> 00:11:48,722
We all thought we'd driven you away
with that horrible salty pudding.

191
00:11:48,806 --> 00:11:52,015
[CHUCKLING] No, indeed.
But I have been away.

192
00:11:52,852 --> 00:11:55,435
He's been in Austria and Germany.

193
00:11:56,022 --> 00:11:58,980
-How interesting.
-Interesting. And worrying.

194
00:12:00,443 --> 00:12:03,311
Sir Anthony is here to
show you his new car.

195
00:12:03,447 --> 00:12:05,814
-Oh.
-I've rather taken to driving myself,

196
00:12:05,949 --> 00:12:09,658
and I have to keep finding destinations
to justify it.

197
00:12:09,953 --> 00:12:11,318
What kind of car is it?

198
00:12:11,455 --> 00:12:15,996
It's an open Rolls-Royce and I wondered
if you might like a spin in it.

199
00:12:16,461 --> 00:12:19,169
Oh, how kind. But alas, not today.

200
00:12:19,297 --> 00:12:22,255
I've had Diamond saddled
and he's waiting for me.

201
00:12:22,342 --> 00:12:24,333
You could ride this afternoon.

202
00:12:24,469 --> 00:12:28,338
But it's arranged now.
But thank you, Sir Anthony.

203
00:12:29,975 --> 00:12:31,761
Do ask me again.

204
00:12:37,024 --> 00:12:39,356
I don't suppose you'd take me.

205
00:12:42,364 --> 00:12:44,856
Of course. I should be delighted.

206
00:12:48,703 --> 00:12:50,364
What is it that I am accused of?

207
00:12:50,497 --> 00:12:54,241
Oh. Nobody is accusing you of anything.

208
00:12:54,335 --> 00:12:59,421
But there has been a suggestion
that you were handling the cellar key,

209
00:12:59,507 --> 00:13:01,748
and before I take it any further

210
00:13:01,843 --> 00:13:05,256
I want to find if there's
a simple explanation.

211
00:13:05,638 --> 00:13:08,097
Because some wine is missing.

212
00:13:08,183 --> 00:13:10,094
How do you know that?

213
00:13:14,356 --> 00:13:18,395
Right. Well, we'll leave it there for now.

214
00:13:28,329 --> 00:13:31,287
The Kaiser is such a mercurial figure,

215
00:13:31,374 --> 00:13:35,494
one minute the warlord,
the next a lovelorn poet.

216
00:13:36,589 --> 00:13:39,081
But a poet in need of an empire.

217
00:13:39,842 --> 00:13:43,881
That's very good.
"A poet in need of an empire." Yes.

218
00:13:45,681 --> 00:13:48,595
My late wife used to say that...

219
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:52,807
-What did Lady Strallan used to say?
-Oh, never mind.

220
00:13:52,898 --> 00:13:57,267
-But I should like to hear it.
-Really? Would you, really?

221
00:13:59,112 --> 00:14:03,823
She used to say that Kaiser Bill
loved uniforms and medals

222
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:06,823
but he never really connected them
with fighting.

223
00:14:06,913 --> 00:14:08,449
[BOTH LAUGH]

224
00:14:10,041 --> 00:14:14,127
-What was she like?
-Maud? Oh, she was awfully funny.

225
00:14:15,255 --> 00:14:18,213
Some people couldn't see it, but she was.

226
00:14:32,815 --> 00:14:36,103
-Is Lynch anywhere about?
-Oh, I haven't seen him, my lady.

227
00:14:36,194 --> 00:14:39,357
-My horse is lame.
-I could have a look at him.

228
00:14:40,157 --> 00:14:41,407
Do you know about horses?

229
00:14:41,492 --> 00:14:43,984
I looked after the horses
on me father's farm.

230
00:14:44,078 --> 00:14:47,128
-It was the best job in the world.
-Then why did you leave it?

231
00:14:47,331 --> 00:14:50,083
Me mother wanted me to have a chance
of bettering myself.

232
00:14:50,167 --> 00:14:51,703
As a second footman?

233
00:14:51,835 --> 00:14:54,498
It's a good place for me, my lady.

234
00:14:54,714 --> 00:14:57,081
Of course it is. I'm sorry.

235
00:14:58,927 --> 00:15:02,886
She hopes, one day,
that I might be first footman,

236
00:15:03,014 --> 00:15:06,006
-or even get to be...
-Carson had better watch out.

237
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:08,722
Stranger things happen at sea.

238
00:15:10,731 --> 00:15:13,769
I've seen Mr. Bates with a bottle
from time to time.

239
00:15:13,859 --> 00:15:15,736
I must have thought he was helping you.

240
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:18,357
Why would I order a valet
to help with the wine?

241
00:15:18,489 --> 00:15:21,528
Well, when you put it like that,
of course you wouldn't.

242
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:26,746
So, Mr. Bates is taking wine.
And why would this be?

243
00:15:27,582 --> 00:15:29,038
To drink it?

244
00:15:29,501 --> 00:15:31,037
It's not to clean his boots.

245
00:15:31,169 --> 00:15:32,911
Thank you, Thomas.

246
00:15:35,383 --> 00:15:39,672
Daisy? Thomas says you have something
to add to this.

247
00:15:39,762 --> 00:15:41,472
-Well...
-You are not in any trouble,

248
00:15:41,556 --> 00:15:43,763
or any danger of trouble.

249
00:15:45,184 --> 00:15:47,392
You remember what you saw.

250
00:15:48,355 --> 00:15:51,313
I may have seen him
coming out of the cellar.

251
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:54,563
"May". Did you or didn't you?

252
00:15:56,905 --> 00:16:01,150
It's very hard for the girl, Mr. Carson.
You're frightening her.

253
00:16:02,746 --> 00:16:07,161
I'm sorry. Thank you. You may go.

254
00:16:20,598 --> 00:16:22,509
Thank you, O'Brien.

255
00:16:23,559 --> 00:16:25,516
How is everything downstairs?

256
00:16:25,604 --> 00:16:29,438
All right, I think, my lady.
Though Mr. Carson's a bit cast down.

257
00:16:29,566 --> 00:16:31,773
Oh? Why? What's the matter with him?

258
00:16:31,902 --> 00:16:34,769
He's found out something about...

259
00:16:34,863 --> 00:16:39,483
Well, a person he admires,
and it isn't very nice.

260
00:16:41,662 --> 00:16:44,154
Has he said who this person is?

261
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:47,408
Who's proved a disappointment.

262
00:16:47,502 --> 00:16:49,869
I don't like to say, my lady.

263
00:16:50,254 --> 00:16:52,838
-Please do, if you know.
-Oh, I know.

264
00:16:54,676 --> 00:16:56,383
It's Mr. Bates.

265
00:16:56,678 --> 00:16:59,591
Oh, Bates. Why? What's he done?

266
00:16:59,681 --> 00:17:03,766
You should ask Mr. Carson, my lady.
It's not my place to tell.

267
00:17:08,733 --> 00:17:10,144
Papa?

268
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:16,439
Can Branson drive me into Ripon
on Friday evening?

269
00:17:16,825 --> 00:17:20,114
I don't think so, no.
Not after the last time.

270
00:17:21,789 --> 00:17:25,123
Oh, please.
There's a meeting of my borstal charity.

271
00:17:25,626 --> 00:17:28,709
I've missed two and I
simply must be there.

272
00:17:29,171 --> 00:17:32,290
You'd have to take Mary or Edith with you.

273
00:17:33,051 --> 00:17:36,840
Don't make me. Those meetings are deadly
at the best of times,

274
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:39,592
and you know what they're like
when they're bored.

275
00:17:39,683 --> 00:17:42,766
Why are all your causes
so steeped in gloom?

276
00:17:43,687 --> 00:17:46,521
Because it's the gloomy things
that need our help.

277
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:49,941
If everything in the garden's sunny,
why meddle?

278
00:17:50,862 --> 00:17:52,569
Well, I agree with that.

279
00:17:52,655 --> 00:17:55,818
Talking of sunny, are you looking forward
to your coming season?

280
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:57,364
I am, rather.

281
00:18:01,457 --> 00:18:04,040
Hello. What are you doing here?

282
00:18:04,126 --> 00:18:07,710
I'm in search of your father.
Carson thought he was outside.

283
00:18:07,796 --> 00:18:10,037
-He's in the library.
-Oh.

284
00:18:14,387 --> 00:18:16,094
What is it?

285
00:18:16,222 --> 00:18:18,641
Nothing much. I've had an
inquiry about one of the farms.

286
00:18:18,725 --> 00:18:19,886
Oh.

287
00:18:27,401 --> 00:18:31,315
So, what's new at the big house?

288
00:18:32,072 --> 00:18:34,154
Sybil, mainly.

289
00:18:34,241 --> 00:18:38,281
She's discovered politics,
which of course makes Papa see red.

290
00:18:38,622 --> 00:18:41,159
I admire Sybil's passion, though.

291
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:45,747
Of course. But then I
like a good argument.

292
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:48,166
Papa does not.

293
00:18:49,424 --> 00:18:51,962
If you really like an argument...

294
00:18:52,428 --> 00:18:55,546
-Yes?
-We should see more of each other.

295
00:19:03,272 --> 00:19:05,310
So, it's all right? I can go?

00:19:08,153 --> 00:19:11,066
-Will you be late?
-I think I'll miss dinner.

298
00:19:11,156 --> 00:19:15,320
Well, remember to tell Branson
to take a sandwich for himself.

COUNTESS: Susan Flintshire.

-Well, prepare for the worst.

00:19:30,468 --> 00:19:32,176
Not the first page.

00:19:32,304 --> 00:19:35,842
My poor niece never uses one word
when 20 will do.

303
00:19:35,975 --> 00:19:39,058
Start there. "I'm sorry..."

304
00:19:39,144 --> 00:19:42,978
"I'm sorry to have to tell you that Hugh
has heard a vile story"

00:19:43,107 --> 00:19:45,816
"about your granddaughter Mary..."

306
00:19:46,987 --> 00:19:49,820
Sorry? She's thrilled.

307
00:19:52,158 --> 00:19:55,150
Now, first I must ask,

308
00:19:55,245 --> 00:19:59,410
and I want you to think carefully
before you answer.

309
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,662
Is any of this true?

310
00:20:05,756 --> 00:20:06,962
I see.

311
00:20:08,301 --> 00:20:12,341
Some of it is true. How much?

312
00:20:15,517 --> 00:20:17,428
Oh, dear.

313
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:19,351
She didn't drag him.

314
00:20:19,438 --> 00:20:20,538
I wondered about that.

315
00:20:20,647 --> 00:20:24,061
I mean, obviously Susan's
forgotten the distance

and the bachelors' corridor.

She couldn't manage it alone.

318
00:20:29,574 --> 00:20:31,611
So how did she do it?

319
00:20:32,744 --> 00:20:37,160
I helped her.
She woke me up and I helped her.

320
00:20:39,918 --> 00:20:43,752
Well. I always thought

00:20:43,839 --> 00:20:47,753
this family might be
approaching dissolution.

322
00:20:48,344 --> 00:20:52,054
I didn't know dissolution
was already upon us.

00:20:55,644 --> 00:20:57,885
No. And he isn't going to.

Oh.

326
00:21:01,399 --> 00:21:03,777
Of course it was terribly wrong.
It was all terribly wrong.

327
00:21:03,861 --> 00:21:05,070
But I didn't see what else...

328
00:21:05,154 --> 00:21:10,695
Please! I can't listen to your attempts
to try and justify yourself.

329
00:21:12,244 --> 00:21:14,986
I know this is hard for you to hear.

330
00:21:15,456 --> 00:21:18,575
God knows it was hard for me
to live through.

331
00:21:19,628 --> 00:21:22,791
But if you expect me
to disown my daughter,

332
00:21:22,881 --> 00:21:25,589
I'm afraid you will be disappointed.

333
00:21:30,556 --> 00:21:31,887
Good day.

334
00:21:39,065 --> 00:21:41,147
I thought you must be out here.

335
00:21:41,234 --> 00:21:43,020
And you'd be right.

336
00:21:46,407 --> 00:21:49,490
-I know you're upset.
-Yes. I'm upset.

337
00:21:50,703 --> 00:21:52,785
I have been working here two years,

338
00:21:52,871 --> 00:21:56,114
and yet Mr. Carson has no difficulty
believing the worst of me.

339
00:21:56,208 --> 00:21:59,167
I think he has a great deal of difficulty,

340
00:21:59,295 --> 00:22:02,538
which is why he hasn't
told his lordship yet.

341
00:22:02,966 --> 00:22:06,175
-Can't you just explain about Thomas?
-Not now.

342
00:22:06,302 --> 00:22:09,135
It would sound like a false accusation.

343
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:12,097
You can't take it lying down.

344
00:22:12,184 --> 00:22:14,676
Because you're not guilty of any wrong,

345
00:22:14,812 --> 00:22:17,429
and before it's over
I'm going to tell the world.

346
00:22:17,523 --> 00:22:22,313
Are you? I'm not sure
the world is listening.

347
00:22:25,991 --> 00:22:28,574
Sorry. I'm a bit late tonight.

348
00:22:28,869 --> 00:22:31,076
Not to worry. How are you?

349
00:22:32,998 --> 00:22:34,659
Bearing up.

350
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,959
This isn't the end. You mustn't give up.

351
00:22:38,504 --> 00:22:39,994
We'll get there.

352
00:22:40,131 --> 00:22:43,669
Forgive me, my lady,
but, well, you don't get it.

353
00:22:44,552 --> 00:22:47,137
You're brought up to think
it's all within your grasp,

354
00:22:47,221 --> 00:22:51,011
that if you want something enough,
it will come to you.

355
00:22:51,351 --> 00:22:53,513
But we're not like that.

356
00:22:54,229 --> 00:22:58,848
We don't think our dreams
are bound to come true because...

357
00:22:58,984 --> 00:23:01,146
Because they almost never do.

358
00:23:01,236 --> 00:23:04,195
Then that's why we must stick together.

359
00:23:04,365 --> 00:23:08,700
Your dream is my dream now.
And I'll make it come true.

360
00:23:15,168 --> 00:23:16,659
Why hasn't he done anything?

361
00:23:16,754 --> 00:23:19,086
He's had the story and the witnesses.

362
00:23:19,215 --> 00:23:23,334
"The witnesses"? What do you
think this is, a murder mystery?

363
00:23:24,386 --> 00:23:26,377
Well, Mr. Bates can't accuse me now.

364
00:23:26,472 --> 00:23:28,598
It'll sound as if
he's trying to get his own back.

365
00:23:28,682 --> 00:23:32,802
If I lose my job over this,
I swear to God I'll swing for you.

366
00:23:40,904 --> 00:23:44,148
Is there any stale bread
you're throwing out, and some salt?

367
00:23:44,242 --> 00:23:45,482
Why?

368
00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:48,162
Well, I thought I'd make a last
hot poultice for Diamond.

369
00:23:48,246 --> 00:23:49,621
It'll give him a better night.

370
00:23:49,705 --> 00:23:52,993
You big softie. What'll Mr. Lynch say?

371
00:23:53,084 --> 00:23:54,995
Why, he doesn't mind.

372
00:23:55,086 --> 00:23:57,374
He says I've got the touch.

373
00:23:57,923 --> 00:24:00,133
He thinks I should pack this in
and be a groom.

374
00:24:00,217 --> 00:24:01,878
Why don't you?

375
00:24:02,928 --> 00:24:06,762
My mum.
She was so excited when I came here.

376
00:24:07,724 --> 00:24:10,968
They're proud of me
and I'd hate to spoil that.

377
00:24:11,646 --> 00:24:13,387
Do you miss them?

378
00:24:16,109 --> 00:24:18,646
I never had that in my childhood,

379
00:24:18,736 --> 00:24:21,103
someone you could always trust.

380
00:24:21,865 --> 00:24:25,700
I trust them. They trust me.
There are no lies in our house.

381
00:24:27,413 --> 00:24:29,450
Thanks. That's enough.

382
00:24:37,591 --> 00:24:39,628
I'm glad to catch you.

383
00:24:40,051 --> 00:24:43,419
We have a conundrum at the hospital,
and I would value your opinion.

384
00:24:43,513 --> 00:24:44,594
Of course.

385
00:24:44,681 --> 00:24:48,299
We've been treating the mother
of your footman, William Mason.

386
00:24:48,393 --> 00:24:49,686
What's the matter with her?

387
00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:54,355
Heart, I'm afraid. She's forbidden us
to say anything to her son.

388
00:24:54,442 --> 00:24:55,853
That's ridiculous.

389
00:24:55,943 --> 00:24:58,435
She's gone home now,
but she's still very ill.

390
00:24:58,529 --> 00:25:01,066
Clearly the boy should go and see her.

391
00:25:01,157 --> 00:25:02,659
And I assume you would have
no objections?

392
00:25:02,743 --> 00:25:03,778
Of course not.

393
00:25:03,869 --> 00:25:08,705
So, do we break a patient's confidence

394
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:12,124
and disobey her orders? Or not?

395
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:14,793
We can't. If she's forbidden it.

396
00:25:15,298 --> 00:25:18,165
-I must say I agree with you.
-Well, I'll tell him.

397
00:25:18,259 --> 00:25:22,378
No, you will not. She has rights, too.
And there are rules.

398
00:25:22,472 --> 00:25:25,009
I don't care a fig about rules.

399
00:25:28,687 --> 00:25:32,065
-Where to from here, my lady?
-SYBIL: What do you mean? We've arrived.

400
00:25:32,149 --> 00:25:33,692
The meeting's in one of
these buildings here?

401
00:25:33,776 --> 00:25:37,070
SYBIL: This is the meeting.
We're here for the counting of the votes.

402
00:25:37,154 --> 00:25:39,395
I don't understand. I thought that...

403
00:25:39,531 --> 00:25:40,862
Don't be silly, Branson.

404
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:43,119
You didn't think
I'd miss my very first by-election?

405
00:25:43,203 --> 00:25:46,205
-I don't think his lordship would approve.
-Let me worry about him. [CAR HONKS]

406
00:25:46,289 --> 00:25:47,957
I have to park the car! Don't move.
Stay where you are!

407
00:25:48,041 --> 00:25:51,250
Really, Branson. I
thought I gave the orders.

408
00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:54,917
Well, I said to...

409
00:25:55,049 --> 00:25:56,210
Sir Anthony Strallan.

410
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:57,718
-Sir Anthony?
-Don't worry, Lady Grantham.

411
00:25:57,802 --> 00:25:59,543
I haven't got the date wrong.

412
00:25:59,637 --> 00:26:02,639
What a relief. I could hear Cora wondering
if the dinner would stretch.

413
00:26:02,723 --> 00:26:05,590
[CHUCKLES] No. I'm not really here at all.

414
00:26:05,726 --> 00:26:08,313
But I was driving past your gates
on the way to the Callender-Becketts,

415
00:26:08,397 --> 00:26:09,522
and I thought I'd take a chance.

416
00:26:09,606 --> 00:26:14,021
See, the thing is, I've got two tickets
for a concert in York next Friday...

417
00:26:14,111 --> 00:26:17,069
How nice. Although, I can't...

418
00:26:17,155 --> 00:26:21,070
No. I was hoping that Lady Edith
might like to accompany me.

419
00:26:21,577 --> 00:26:23,318
But I'd love to.

420
00:26:23,413 --> 00:26:25,780
Shouldn't you ask
what sort of concert it is?

421
00:26:25,915 --> 00:26:28,373
Just Hungry Hundreds stuff, mostly,
you know.

422
00:26:28,459 --> 00:26:32,248
Bellini, Puccini, Rossini.
I'm not up to anything complicated.

423
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:33,791
I'd like that very much.

424
00:26:33,923 --> 00:26:38,384
Excellent. Well, it's quite a hike,
so I'll pick you up around 6:00.

425
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:40,722
Lady Jervas has asked us
for a bite to eat afterwards.

426
00:26:40,806 --> 00:26:43,016
-If that's all right with your mother?
-By all means.

427
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:46,718
Well, I must run.
I hope I haven't spoiled your dinner.

428
00:26:46,812 --> 00:26:49,771
We may have to hire a nurse, after all.

from the beginning.

431
00:27:01,287 --> 00:27:02,412
Do these biscuits go up?

432
00:27:02,496 --> 00:27:05,409
-No, I put them out for the fairies.
-Oh.

433
00:27:05,499 --> 00:27:07,957
Of course they're going up.

434
00:27:08,085 --> 00:27:09,371
What's wrong with you?

435
00:27:09,462 --> 00:27:13,877
You're always dozy, but tonight
you'd make Sleeping Beauty look alert.

436
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:15,048
I was just thinking.

437
00:27:15,135 --> 00:27:17,752
Oh, blimey! Batten down the hatches.

438
00:27:18,305 --> 00:27:22,299
-I think I've let myself down.
-It can't be a new sensation.

-Why? What do I need a coat for?
-I've come to fetch you, my lady.

We've taken Lady Sybil to Crawley House
in the village.

My God! Oh, my darling...

473
00:29:50,468 --> 00:29:53,221
I didn't know what to do,
so I had Branson bring her here.

474
00:29:53,305 --> 00:29:54,295
Quite right.

475
00:29:54,389 --> 00:29:57,559
Mama would have fainted if she'd
seen her like this. As for Papa...

This will sting a bit.
But it's stopped bleeding.

00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:07,017
Did you know she was planning this?

00:30:07,195 --> 00:30:09,778
-Of course not.
-Well, what were you doing there?

or I wouldn't have stayed.

Oh, I could wring Branson's neck.

What was he thinking?
I'm afraid it'll cost him his job.

484
00:30:20,542 --> 00:30:24,831
No. I told him he was taking me
to a committee meeting.

485
00:30:24,964 --> 00:30:27,883
When he realized what it was,
he wanted to come straight back.

486
00:30:27,967 --> 00:30:32,052
You'll have to stick up for him,
because Papa will skin him alive.

487
00:30:32,179 --> 00:30:34,763
Are you feeling strong enough to go home?

488

I think so. If you'll take me.

Not good, I'm afraid.

She's home but she's still very weak.

496
00:31:13,391 --> 00:31:15,473
Another attack should finish her.

00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:16,925
And he still doesn't know?

498
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:21,730
She's adamant. I've tried to explain
how hard it'll be on him,

499
00:31:21,816 --> 00:31:23,317
but she won't have him disturbed.

00:42:29,909 --> 00:42:31,491
Oh, my darling.

671
00:42:33,955 --> 00:42:38,324
Let's not pretend this isn't the answer
to every one of our prayers.

672
00:42:40,086 --> 00:42:42,169
I'd have to tell him.

673
00:42:43,215 --> 00:42:44,455
Oh

674
00:42:46,135 --> 00:42:48,001
Is it absolutely necessary?

675
00:42:48,095 --> 00:42:50,928
If I didn't, I'd feel as if
I'd caught him with a lie.

676
00:42:51,015 --> 00:42:52,676
[DOOR OPENING]

677
00:42:55,854 --> 00:42:59,097
I hope you know that really smart people
sleep in separate rooms.

678
00:42:59,191 --> 00:43:01,192
I always keep the bed made up
in the dressing room,

679
00:43:01,276 --> 00:43:04,143
so at least I pretend we sleep apart.
Isn't that enough?

680
00:43:04,237 --> 00:43:07,356
No. Never mind. Good night.

681
00:43:12,205 --> 00:43:13,286
Mmm.

682
00:43:13,372 --> 00:43:15,613
Haven't you gone up yet?

683
00:43:15,708 --> 00:43:18,120
Blow this out. You're the last.

684
00:43:18,544 --> 00:43:20,627
-Good night.
-Good night.

685
00:43:20,839 --> 00:43:22,375
Good night.

686
00:43:24,843 --> 00:43:27,631
I'm going to bloody get him.
I don't care what you say.

687
00:43:27,721 --> 00:43:29,132
What would I say?

688
00:43:29,223 --> 00:43:31,089
Everything comes to him who waits.

689
00:43:31,183 --> 00:43:33,516
Well, I've waited long enough.

690
00:43:38,358 --> 00:43:39,940
Does Carson know you're here?

691
00:43:40,026 --> 00:43:42,820
I heard you were going out
and I wanted to see how he was walking.

692
00:43:42,904 --> 00:43:44,690
Lynch is happy for me to ride him.

693
00:43:44,781 --> 00:43:46,237
Oh, yes. He's better.

694
00:43:46,366 --> 00:43:49,780
But I'll wait and see what he's like
when you're up.

695
00:43:50,621 --> 00:43:53,534
William, are you planning to go home soon?

696
00:43:53,624 --> 00:43:55,911
Well, it's a bit far for my half day,

697
00:43:56,043 --> 00:44:00,083
but I can maybe get the time to go in July
when the family's in London.

698
00:44:00,215 --> 00:44:02,832
That's if I don't go with you, of course.

699
00:44:02,926 --> 00:44:05,668
I think you should take a few days off
and go now.

700
00:44:05,762 --> 00:44:10,131
I'll fix it. I'll speak to father
and to Carson. No one will mind.

701
00:44:10,267 --> 00:44:11,974
But why, my lady?

702
00:44:13,146 --> 00:44:15,433
Your mother's not been well.

703
00:44:16,941 --> 00:44:17,976
How do you know?

704
00:44:18,067 --> 00:44:21,230
I heard someone mention it in the village.
I forget who.

705
00:44:22,738 --> 00:44:26,528
-I had a letter and she never said.
-Oh, I'm sure it's nothing.

706
00:44:26,618 --> 00:44:29,531
But I know it would cheer her to see you.

707
00:44:29,621 --> 00:44:31,908
Well, if it wouldn't be a bother.

708
00:44:32,374 --> 00:44:35,742
It won't. I'll arrange it
as soon as I get back.

709
00:44:36,545 --> 00:44:38,877
Thank you very much, my lady.

710
00:44:40,425 --> 00:44:44,134
She ought to spend some time
with the people she loves.

711
00:44:45,930 --> 00:44:47,887
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]

712
00:44:48,933 --> 00:44:51,425
The Dowager Countess, my lady.

713
00:44:53,147 --> 00:44:55,309
Good afternoon, my dear.

714
00:44:56,275 --> 00:44:58,266
Good afternoon.

715
00:44:58,402 --> 00:45:01,645
There's no need to be so prim.
I come in peace.

716
00:45:03,157 --> 00:45:04,943
Shall I sit here?

717
00:45:09,623 --> 00:45:12,365
Now, I've been thinking...

718
00:45:12,459 --> 00:45:17,750
I confess I do not know if I would have
had the strength, mentally or physically,

719
00:45:18,882 --> 00:45:22,797
to carry a corpse the
length of this house.

720
00:45:25,056 --> 00:45:27,297
But I hope I would have done.

721
00:45:29,602 --> 00:45:31,388
You were quite right.

722
00:45:31,479 --> 00:45:33,221
When something bad happens,

723
00:45:33,315 --> 00:45:36,649
there's no point in wishing
it had not happened.

724
00:45:36,735 --> 00:45:40,478
The only option is to minimize the damage.

725
00:45:41,490 --> 00:45:45,906
Or try to. But if the
Flintshires have got hold of it...

726
00:45:45,995 --> 00:45:47,906
I've written to Susan.

727
00:45:48,665 --> 00:45:54,286
I said it was a story made up
by Mr. Pamuk's enemies to discredit him.

728
00:45:55,672 --> 00:45:57,288
Even if she doesn't believe me,

729
00:45:57,382 --> 00:46:00,876
she won't tell,
in case it reflects badly on her.

730
00:46:01,637 --> 00:46:05,096
The Ambassador is dangerous.

731
00:46:05,182 --> 00:46:09,267
But then, how many people really go
to the Turkish Embassy?

732
00:46:09,728 --> 00:46:11,264
It only takes one.

733
00:46:11,355 --> 00:46:14,849
Well... I mean, that just can't be helped.

734
00:46:15,860 --> 00:46:18,227
We can't have him assassinated,

735
00:46:19,030 --> 00:46:20,395
I suppose.

736
00:46:21,658 --> 00:46:23,569
Robert still doesn't suspect.

737
00:46:23,660 --> 00:46:24,744
Oh, I should hope not.

738
00:46:24,828 --> 00:46:29,949
No, our only way forward is to get
Mary settled as soon as possible.

739
00:46:30,251 --> 00:46:34,415
I have news on that score.
Matthew has proposed.

740
00:46:34,505 --> 00:46:36,997
[GASPING] My, my. Has she said yes?

741
00:46:37,091 --> 00:46:41,962
She hasn't said anything yet, except that
she's going to have to tell him about Pamuk.

742
00:46:42,055 --> 00:46:44,262
For heaven's sake, why?

743
00:46:44,641 --> 00:46:47,679
She thinks to keep it secret
would be dishonorable.

744
00:46:47,769 --> 00:46:50,477
She reads too many novels.

745
00:46:50,564 --> 00:46:54,229
I mean, one way or another,
everyone goes down the aisle

746
00:46:54,319 --> 00:46:56,560
with half the story hidden.

747
00:46:56,696 --> 00:47:00,610
The question is, will she accept Matthew?

748
00:47:01,075 --> 00:47:03,237
I'm not sure.

749
00:47:03,328 --> 00:47:07,618
[SIGHING] Well, if she doesn't,
we'll just have to take her abroad.

750
00:47:07,791 --> 00:47:13,628
In these moments, you can normally
find an Italian who isn't too picky.

751
00:47:15,257 --> 00:47:17,715
We'll give her till the
start of the grouse.

752
00:47:17,801 --> 00:47:23,138
Very well. If she turns Matthew down,
we'll take her to Rome in the autumn.

753
00:47:23,224 --> 00:47:24,806
It's official.

754
00:47:26,936 --> 00:47:29,553
Thank you for not turning against her.

755
00:47:29,647 --> 00:47:30,856
I know that you have rules,

756
00:47:30,940 --> 00:47:34,150
and when people break them
you find it hard to forgive.

757
00:47:34,820 --> 00:47:38,029
I understand that and I respect it.

758
00:47:39,825 --> 00:47:42,613
In this case Mary has the trump card.

759
00:47:42,703 --> 00:47:43,989
What?

760
00:47:44,831 --> 00:47:46,447
Mary is family.
