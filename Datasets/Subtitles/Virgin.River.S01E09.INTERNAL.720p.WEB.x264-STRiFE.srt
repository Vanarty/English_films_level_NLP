1
00:00:16,474 --> 00:00:18,024
Oh.

2
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:19,691
- Oh, yeah.
- Okay.

3
00:00:19,769 --> 00:00:20,649
- Hey.
- Hey.

4
00:00:20,729 --> 00:00:22,899
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm... I'm okay.

5
00:00:35,285 --> 00:00:36,285
Hey.

6
00:00:36,453 --> 00:00:37,453
Hi.

7
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:43,075
Can I get you somethin'?

8
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:45,170
A coffee would be great.

9
00:00:53,678 --> 00:00:54,758
So, um...

10
00:00:56,097 --> 00:00:57,387
about last night.

11
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:58,890
What?

12
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:01,274
Did something happen I should be aware of?

13
00:01:02,687 --> 00:01:03,687
Oh, you're funny.

14
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,150
I would really like
to take you out to dinner.

15
00:01:10,945 --> 00:01:12,855
Think of it as a meal between friends.

16
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:15,947
Come on, we eat together all the time.

17
00:01:16,034 --> 00:01:18,414
Yeah, but this would be different.

18
00:01:18,953 --> 00:01:20,123
All right, no pressure.

19
00:01:20,663 --> 00:01:22,123
All right, no expectations.

20
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:26,964
I, uh...
I just don't know that I'm ready.

21
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,880
You've got about ten hours.
I think you'll be fine.

22
00:01:30,965 --> 00:01:32,675
Stop.

23
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:37,810
- Okay.
- Yes?

24
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:39,269
- Let's do it?
- Yeah. Okay.

25
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:41,266
Okay.

26
00:01:41,726 --> 00:01:42,806
Oh, gosh.

27
00:01:42,894 --> 00:01:45,234
I almost forgot.
I... I have to pick up Doc's breakfast.

28
00:01:45,313 --> 00:01:46,523
Well, Ricky can walk it over.

29
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:48,776
Yeah, I know,
but, uh, he asked me to do it.

30
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:52,494
So tired of him treating me
like his intern-slash-assistant.

31
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:54,071
Yeah, I get it.

32
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:56,199
Just give him some time.

33
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:58,616
It's just that my trial period
is almost up.

34
00:01:58,701 --> 00:02:00,081
Thanks.

35
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:03,579
Look, I know in his heart
he wants you to stay.

36
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:05,958
Yeah.

37
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:08,420
Well, I'm gonna talk to him.

38
00:02:08,753 --> 00:02:10,093
I should get going.

39
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:13,717
- Bye.
- Bye.

40
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,970
Pick you up at six?

41
00:02:17,887 --> 00:02:18,887
Yeah.

42
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:35,534
Stop scratching.

43
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:37,073
I can't stand it.

44
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:38,827
Well, just remember that feeling

45
00:02:38,908 --> 00:02:42,078
next time you try to sneak away
from your field trip, okay?

46
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:43,332
- Okay.
- Yeah. No, no, no.

47
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:44,413
Here.

48
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:48,334
That, and get that prescription filled,
all right?

49
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:52,339
Take care, Benny.

50
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:53,760
Delores.

51
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:55,591
Ben.

52
00:02:56,968 --> 00:02:58,218
I need the keys to your truck.

53
00:02:58,303 --> 00:02:59,723
Oh, good morning to you, sunshine.

54
00:02:59,804 --> 00:03:01,184
I don't have time for formalities.

55
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:03,734
- Keys.
- Well, what's wrong with your car?

56
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:06,901
- You tried to fix it.
- Oh.

57
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:09,398
How on earth did you graduate
medical school?

58
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,400
You know, the other day
you said I was brilliant.

59
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:13,651
Not with cars. Keys.

60
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:15,777
Where you goin'?

61
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:17,701
That's not your business.

62
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:20,490
Oh, my truck, my business.

63
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:21,945
I have errands.

64
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:24,249
Errands.

65
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:25,409
In Clear River.

66
00:03:25,496 --> 00:03:28,626
Uh... Just stay out of Jack's life.

67
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:29,878
It's too late for that.

68
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:32,589
I've treated Jack like family
since he moved to Virgin River,

69
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:35,340
and I'll be damned if I'm gonna
stand by and watch him get hurt.

70
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:37,343
Can't you just leave anything alone?

71
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:39,965
Trust me. He'll be grateful I intervened.

72
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:41,853
Either that or he'll be resentful
you meddled.

73
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:44,138
No, I... I will not be a party to this. No.

74
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:49,314
Fine. I'll just, uh... wait here
until you come to your senses.

75
00:03:50,104 --> 00:03:52,074
Sick people touch those.

76
00:03:52,148 --> 00:03:54,148
I'm not afraid of germs,
and I'm not afraid of you.

77
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,070
Everything okay?

78
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:00,322
Ask Doc.

79
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:02,074
You know what?

80
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:06,245
Since I'm here,
I think I'll just tidy up your office.

81
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:08,709
- You always loved that.
- Okay, okay. Okay.

82
00:04:09,874 --> 00:04:11,004
- Thank you.
- Hm.

83
00:04:13,294 --> 00:04:15,964
That woman is tenacious
with a capital T.

84
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:17,627
That's a nice way of putting it.

85
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:19,125
I wasn't bein' nice.

86
00:04:28,851 --> 00:04:29,851
Thanks.

87
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:38,148
- There somethin' on your mind?
- Yes, actually, there is.

88
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:40,657
Well, go on. Go on. I'm listenin'.

89
00:04:40,738 --> 00:04:42,868
I would like to talk about my future here.

90
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:43,949
Oh, right.

91
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:47,367
Oh, and by the way, before I forget,
we're almost out of coffee.

92
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:51,079
It's not the end of the world.
Just make some more.

93
00:04:51,165 --> 00:04:51,995
Okay.

94
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:53,543
Let me ask you something.

95
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,920
Do you want me to stay here?

96
00:04:56,921 --> 00:04:58,631
Because in order for me to stay,

97
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:02,175
I need to believe
that the work that I'm doing matters.

98
00:05:03,344 --> 00:05:05,974
- Coffee is important.
- I'm not your assistant.

99
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:08,353
I am the doctor.

100
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:10,393
I know, and I respect that.

101
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:14,809
- Good.
- But respect needs to run both ways

102
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:16,936
for us to continue to work together.

103
00:05:29,537 --> 00:05:31,287
Give me a hand with the setup?

104
00:05:31,372 --> 00:05:32,582
Hey, go easy on that thing.

105
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:34,745
Grease and dirt's the only thing
holdin' it together.

106
00:05:37,795 --> 00:05:40,085
Okay, why don't you
put the steel wool down,

107
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:41,673
and step away from the grill?

108
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:48,967
All right, talk to me.

109
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:51,635
Uh, it's, uh... it's Paige.

110
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:54,521
- Is she okay?
- Yeah.

111
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:56,188
No.

112
00:05:56,647 --> 00:05:58,017
No, man. You know, I, uh...

113
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:01,568
think she may be lying to me.

114
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:04,423
- What are you talking about?
- I found an old ID of hers,

115
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:06,197
except it had a different name.

116
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:08,575
Okay.

117
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:09,785
Yeah.

118
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:12,413
I think her... her real name...

119
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:14,959
may be Michelle Logan.

120
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:18,288
Well, people change their names
for all sorts of reasons.

121
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:21,010
Doesn't necessarily make her a liar.

122
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:23,839
Look, I know you like her.

123
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:26,761
Why don't you just ask her
what's goin' on?

124
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:29,215
Well, what if she won't tell me, hm?

125
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:31,598
Well, you can cross that bridge.

126
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:38,610
- Ricky, help me set up, will ya?
- Yeah, sure.

127
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:40,479
Where's Brady?

128
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:41,816
Probably late again.

129
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:43,191
Do you need some help?

130
00:06:43,277 --> 00:06:44,947
I need him to close tonight.

131
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:47,031
Okay. You goin' somewhere?

132
00:06:47,698 --> 00:06:49,618
- Yeah, out.
- With Mel?

133
00:06:50,284 --> 00:06:51,164
Maybe.

134
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:53,964
- What, like on a date?
- No, just dinner.

135
00:06:54,455 --> 00:06:55,955
But I thought she was married.

136
00:06:56,833 --> 00:07:01,173
Well, she... was, and now she's not.

137
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:04,419
Oh. So, uh, where you takin' her?

138
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:08,593
I was thinkin' about Eureka.
There's this little place on the pier.

139
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:11,558
Oh, Arthur's. It's really romantic.

140
00:07:12,056 --> 00:07:13,096
You know that place?

141
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:14,641
I Googled it.

142
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:18,024
Wh... why would you do that?

143
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:21,231
Emily.

144
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:22,614
Emily Walker is why.

145
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:24,742
I... I sit behind her in biology.

146
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:26,149
Ah?

147
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:27,237
And you like her, huh?

148
00:07:27,321 --> 00:07:30,321
Yeah. I... I think she's amazing.

149
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,410
I... I thought maybe if I took her out
or something...

150
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:34,953
Okay.

151
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:36,908
So, what's the move?

152
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:39,128
Oh, I... I don't have any moves.

153
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:40,959
Well, try askin' her out.

154
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:43,882
You've got a fifty/fifty chance
she'll say yes.

155
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:45,803
Yeah, the same chance she'll say no.

156
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:46,882
Be an optimist.

157
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:49,223
- She's way out of my league.
- Says who?

158
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:53,811
The last guy she dated,
he was the captain of the football team.

159
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:56,285
- What's that got to do with it?
- I don't know if you noticed,

160
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:59,189
- but I'm not the captain of anything.
- So? Take a chance, all right?

161
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:01,230
You won't get anything in life
by playing it safe,

162
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:03,072
whether that's Emily or anything else.

163
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:04,899
Sometimes you gotta stick your neck out.

164
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:08,244
You're smart, kind, respectful.

165
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:09,781
She'll be lucky to have you.

166
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:17,374
There you go.
Thank you so much for coming in.

167
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:19,827
I'm glad you like it.

168
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:26,463
Charmaine.

169
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:27,971
- Hi.
- Hi.

170
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:29,514
Just started snowing.

171
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:31,472
Yeah, that happens here sometimes.

172
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:33,512
What are you doing in Clear River, Hope?

173
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:34,886
Uh, I came to see you.

174
00:08:34,972 --> 00:08:36,392
Are you gonna get rid of the gray?

175
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:39,604
Oh, I think some lowlights
would just really brighten your face up.

176
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:41,475
My face is bright enough. Here.

177
00:08:48,152 --> 00:08:49,202
I... I...

178
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:52,407
I don't understand.
Did Jack tell you to give this back to me?

179
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:55,030
- Not exactly.
- Then why do you still have it?

180
00:08:55,117 --> 00:08:57,827
Because I think you need to talk to Jack

181
00:08:57,912 --> 00:09:00,622
about the contents of this letter
in person.

182
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:01,536
You read it?

183
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:03,384
The envelope wasn't sealed.

184
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:06,459
It was in a box with a lid on it.

185
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:07,916
It's... it's addressed to Jack.

186
00:09:08,005 --> 00:09:10,545
Okay, look. Let's not bicker
about whose fault this is.

187
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:14,603
The point is I read it,
and you need to talk to him.

188
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:17,519
I can't. That's why I wrote the letter.

189
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:20,938
So, wait until you can
and then go talk to him.

190
00:09:21,018 --> 00:09:22,018
No.

191
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,560
I'm... I'm moving on.

192
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:25,226
I... I don't want to have

193
00:09:25,314 --> 00:09:27,574
some big dramatic conversation,

194
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:29,490
just shake everything up, I just...

195
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:32,281
I I just wanted him to know how I felt.

196
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:34,533
Are you trying to hurt him?

197
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:37,369
Because that's how he's going to feel
when he reads this.

198
00:09:37,451 --> 00:09:40,791
He's gonna think you don't care
about how this might affect him.

199
00:09:40,871 --> 00:09:42,291
It's all in the letter.

200
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:44,996
I know Jack.

201
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:47,094
He's going to want to talk to you.

202
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:49,299
I... I've waited long enough. I...

203
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:51,972
I should have left him a long time ago.

204
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:54,894
I have a... a client.

205
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:58,469
Could you just please respect my wishes
and just give Jack the letter?

206
00:09:58,556 --> 00:09:59,556
Please.

207
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:02,936
For the record,
I think you're making a mistake.

208
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:05,769
Well. It's a good thing
it's not your decision to make.

209
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:16,820
Doc!

210
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:19,117
Doc!

211
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:21,372
Jeb, Pauline. What's goin' on?

212
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:22,576
Oh, Annabelle.

213
00:10:22,663 --> 00:10:24,753
Annabelle, here.
Sit down, right here, sweetie.

214
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,711
How long has she been like this?

215
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:29,802
I don't know exactly, uh...
About an hour, maybe.

216
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,209
She's having trouble breathing.

217
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:33,627
Those inhaler things you gave her,
they aren't workin'.

218
00:10:34,216 --> 00:10:36,256
Annabelle has a... a touch of asthma.

219
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:39,197
Why don't we get you in the exam room?
We'll take a listen to those lungs

220
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:41,561
and see why they're havin'
to work so hard, okay, sweetie?

221
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:43,771
It's gonna be okay.
Just come right in here.

222
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:46,561
Are you... are you okay?

223
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,146
Oh... just a bit of a headache.

224
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:49,950
Bit of a headache.
How long have you had it?

225
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:52,362
Uh... I get 'em all the time.
I'm a logger.

226
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:54,903
Okay. Can you take a seat for me?
Just a second.

227
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:56,656
Yeah. Okay, all right.

228
00:10:57,114 --> 00:10:58,874
Look, help my girl, okay? I'll be fine.

229
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:02,079
Doc is in with her. I just wanna
take a look at you real fast, okay?

230
00:11:02,286 --> 00:11:04,246
It's gonna be quick and painless,
I promise.

231
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:09,379
Have your headaches
been getting worse recently?

232
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:12,002
Give or take.

233
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,720
This is gonna be really tight
on your arm, okay?

234
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:20,804
- Okay...
- Okay.

235
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:24,386
There we go. Good.
I have to listen to your lungs.

236
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:25,684
Okay.

237
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:30,363
Yeah.

238
00:11:40,157 --> 00:11:41,577
Okay. I'll be right back.

239
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:47,770
Mel, can I talk to you for a minute?

240
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:48,832
Yeah.

241
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:50,936
- Just stay right here.
- Wh...

242
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,880
- I'll be right back. Okay?
- What's wrong?

243
00:11:56,006 --> 00:11:57,336
Yeah, it's not her asthma.

244
00:11:57,425 --> 00:11:59,255
- Allergies?
- No, she has none.

245
00:11:59,343 --> 00:12:01,763
And my gut feeling
is this is not an allergic reaction.

246
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:04,136
Well, Jeb has diminished breath sounds
on both sides,

247
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,733
and his oxygen sats are around 80.

248
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:08,309
- That can't be a coincidence.
- No.

249
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:09,234
What about Pauline?

250
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:12,311
She looked distressed, too,
but I was... I was focusing on Annabelle.

251
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:14,728
Besides the breathing issues,
Annabelle is nauseous,

252
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:16,187
sweaty, slow heart rate.

253
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:18,857
- She's bradycarding.
- I'm guessing it's some kind of poisoning.

254
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:21,486
- Agreed.
- Okay. We won't know how to treat them

255
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:23,414
until we know what it is
we're dealing with.

256
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:25,292
You go in with them.
I'll get the charcoal.

257
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:27,999
- Okay.
- Okay. And... and, oh, start an IV.

258
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,540
Annabelle's BP is down.

259
00:12:29,623 --> 00:12:31,423
- I don't want her fluids getting low.
- Okay.

260
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:33,339
- Lactated Ringer's?
- Exactly.

261
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:38,303
- Where's Doc?
- He'll be right back.

262
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:40,755
- Hi, Annabelle.
- Hi.

263
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:44,221
Hi. My name is Mel.

264
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:47,015
I'm just gonna pop an IV
in your hand, okay?

265
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:48,769
- Okay.
- It's not gonna hurt.

266
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:51,151
- Uh-huh.
- I'm very good at this. Okay?

267
00:12:52,396 --> 00:12:54,606
Pauline, did, uh,
Annabelle go to school today?

268
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:57,860
Uh, no, we kept her home.
She wasn't feeling well.

269
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:00,284
We've all been under the weather lately.

270
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:03,492
You're not feeling well either?
What are your symptoms?

271
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:06,584
Oh, just tired, uh,
nauseous, bad headache.

272
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:09,540
I thought it might be the stomach flu.
Jeb's got it, too.

273
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:11,122
We don't think it's the stomach flu.

274
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:13,747
No. We think you've all been exposed
to some kind of toxin.

275
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,670
Now, Pauline, I need you to focus.

276
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:17,964
- Hold that.
- Okay.

277
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:20,167
And have you been
preparing any new dishes?

278
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:23,048
Uh, done your grocery shopping
anywhere new?

279
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:26,136
- Drink that. Try and keep it down.
- Is there anything

280
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:27,892
that Annabelle
could have gotten into?

281
00:13:28,432 --> 00:13:29,772
I keep the shed locked.

282
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:32,350
That's where I keep anything
that's dangerous.

283
00:13:32,436 --> 00:13:34,146
What about cleaning products,
or gardening?

284
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:36,270
We keep all that in the shed, too.

285
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:43,779
She needs to get to a hospital.
Who do I call?

286
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:46,204
It'll take EMT services hours to get here.

287
00:13:46,283 --> 00:13:48,043
- She doesn't have hours.
- I know.

288
00:13:48,118 --> 00:13:49,828
That's why we're gonna
take her ourselves.

289
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:53,000
Okay, we gotta go now.

290
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:56,794
Okay, Jeb.
Your truck has a back seat, right?

291
00:13:56,877 --> 00:13:58,047
- Uh, yeah.
- Good. Okay.

292
00:13:58,128 --> 00:13:59,588
Mel, I'm driving.

293
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:02,755
You'll hold Annabelle's IV in the back.

294
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,092
- Bring my bag.
- Got it.

295
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:05,846
Here we go.

296
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:13,768
Jack?

297
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:17,978
All right.
Ricky, will you take their lunch order?

298
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:21,169
- I need to talk to you in private.
- I can't talk right now.

299
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:22,629
- Jack.
- Brady hasn't even shown up.

300
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:24,703
- Ricky can handle things.
- No, he can't.

301
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:28,280
Fine.
I'll... come back before the dinner rush.

302
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:29,948
Well, I won't be here.

303
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:32,082
Okay. Whoa, whoa. What's going on?

304
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:33,582
- All right.
- What?

305
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:34,834
Can you be discreet?

306
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:38,228
I can't believe I just asked you that.
How about a 24-hour gag order?

307
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:39,252
Fine.

308
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:42,262
- I'm taking Mel out to dinner.
- Damn it.

309
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:44,259
That's not exactly the reaction
I expected.

310
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:47,011
- This can't wait.
- Just let me get this order in.

311
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:48,264
I'll meet you in ten minutes.

312
00:14:48,345 --> 00:14:49,385
- In your office.
- Okay.

313
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:50,471
Okay.

314
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:51,601
Hey, guys.

315
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:54,062
Oh, all of you?
Hey, Ricky. Give us a hand here?

316
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:57,441
She's bradying down.

317
00:14:57,521 --> 00:14:58,811
- Is she hypoxic?
- Yes.

318
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:00,268
- BVM?
- It's in the bag.

319
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:02,105
Annabelle. Annabelle!

320
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:04,572
Okay. I need you to keep this
over her nose and mouth.

321
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:07,073
- What are you doing?
- I'm helping her to breathe.

322
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:12,622
Hey, be careful!

323
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:15,373
- Sorry, sorry.
- Please help her. Please help my baby.

324
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:17,393
How long until we get to the hospital?

325
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:19,839
Gardening. Uh...

326
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:20,919
Doc.

327
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,857
- Gardening. Gardening.
- No.They kept the supplies in the shed.

328
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:25,421
No, not that kind of gardening.

329
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:28,507
Jeb, did you ever get hooked up
to the town water supply?

330
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:30,144
Been saving up for the contractor.

331
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,900
So, where are you gettin' your water from?

332
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,641
Still using the well on our property.

333
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:35,684
Which borders state park land.

334
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:39,608
Which is right down the road from where
our friend Calvin has his grow operation.

335
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:41,568
I saw pesticides in the supply tent.

336
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:44,489
I think... I think that's leeching
into their groundwater.

337
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:47,777
- Do you have atropine?
- Yeah, bag. Right side.

338
00:15:47,863 --> 00:15:49,283
That'll counteract the poison.

339
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:53,198
- Help her, please.
- Yeah. Okay. It's okay.

340
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:55,615
Hang in there, baby.

341
00:15:58,248 --> 00:15:59,748
Annabelle, please.

342
00:16:09,176 --> 00:16:11,966
- Hospital's ahead.
- Come on. We're almost there.

343
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:14,264
- Come on, Annabelle.
- Okay, we're comin' in.

344
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:20,058
Where are my wheelchairs?
I need two wheelchairs.

345
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:21,475
Clear the trauma rooms.

346
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:24,483
Hit that oxygen hard.
We're gonna need an atropine drip.

347
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:26,397
- Here they are.
- Hi.

348
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:29,281
Okay, Doc, what do we have?

349
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:32,373
We've got a 12-year-old female
suffering from organophosphate poisoning.

350
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:34,539
No known allergies.
History of asthma. Mel?

351
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:36,868
She's tachycardic.
We've helped with ventilation

352
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:39,124
and given her two amps of atropine
on the way.

353
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:42,749
You're gonna be okay.

354
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:46,714
Okay, we've got it from here.
Okay, folks. Let's move.

355
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:48,127
These are her parents.

356
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:50,485
We suspect that they have been exposed
to the same poison.

357
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:52,299
- I want to go with Annabelle.
- Right.

358
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:54,046
- Okay, she's gonna be okay.
- Yeah.

359
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:55,991
- Go with her now. Take them there.
- It's okay.

360
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,015
Okay.

361
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:01,523
Oh!

362
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:03,229
God.

363
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:08,489
- I hope we got her here in time.
- Yeah.

364
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:09,954
I think...

365
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:11,819
I think we did.

366
00:17:15,492 --> 00:17:16,492
Uh... All right, just...

367
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:18,535
I don't have much time.
Just tell me what you need.

368
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:24,038
What's this?

369
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:26,876
It's from Charmaine.
She asked me to give it to you.

370
00:17:27,504 --> 00:17:29,094
Well, why would she write me a letter?

371
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:31,973
I think she's afraid
if she talks to you in person

372
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,971
she'll end up wanting you back.

373
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,973
Come on.
She's the one that broke up with me.

374
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,595
She knows
you aren't in love with her.

375
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:40,311
Well, I... I can't make myself
feel something I don't.

376
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:43,402
Exactly. And you shouldn't.
Which is something I want you to remember

377
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:45,039
when you read her letter.

378
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:47,375
- Just... Can you give us a minute?
- Uh...

379
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:48,399
- Um...
- Yeah.

380
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:50,572
Jack, you need to read that.

381
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:51,862
Okay, yeah. I will.

382
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:55,659
That party of six,
the order's all messed up.

383
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:57,461
- All right. I'll be right there.
- Promise?

384
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:59,373
- Uh, I said I would.
- All right, then.

385
00:18:02,998 --> 00:18:05,078
- Uh, Brady, come here.
- What's up?

386
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:07,213
I... I need you to close tonight.

387
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,050
- Can't Preacher do it?
- What?

388
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:12,131
Fine.

389
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:14,008
And you're late.

390
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:15,798
Yeah. Uh...

391
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,715
I know. I'm... sorry about that.

392
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:20,886
That happens again, we'll have a problem.
Understand?

393
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:22,558
Yes, sir.

394
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:44,537
You know, we should really warn
the people in that area

395
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:46,423
that their groundwater
may be contaminated.

396
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,500
Yeah. Yeah.

397
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:50,634
And I need to pay a visit to Calvin.

398
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:52,012
That sounds dangerous.

399
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:55,218
Well, you know, Calvin appreciates
the...

400
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:58,848
you know,
the importance of keeping the peace.

401
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:02,097
I don't know why you help him.

402
00:19:02,182 --> 00:19:03,602
Oh, I don't help him.

403
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:07,099
You're always going up to the camps.

404
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:10,193
Yeah, but it's not for Calvin.
He's a son of a bitch.

405
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:13,688
His workers deserve decent healthcare.

406
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:18,528
Well, that's very noble of you.

407
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:20,778
Nothing noble about...

408
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:22,870
caring about people.

409
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:24,955
More people should do it.

410
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:27,665
Hm.

411
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:30,880
Not for nothin'...

412
00:19:32,045 --> 00:19:33,375
you were great back there.

413
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:37,133
Thank you.

414
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:42,175
That LA hospital must have hated
to lose you.

415
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:48,227
Yeah. Well, I needed a change of scenery.

416
00:19:50,939 --> 00:19:52,649
So, does that mean you're stayin'?

417
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:55,779
Um, are you asking?

418
00:19:56,987 --> 00:20:01,277
Well, I would be open to...
extending your trial period.

419
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:03,786
No. There's no more trial period.

420
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:04,949
Aah.

421
00:20:05,787 --> 00:20:07,287
I'm not changing the stationery.

422
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:08,712
I can live with that.

423
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:18,088
I need a coffee.

424
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:19,255
- Jeez.
- Yeah.

425
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:27,940
Can I get you a cup?

426
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:32,401
I would love a latte.

427
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:35,476
Good Lord, even your drink is difficult.

428
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:57,506
You said he was gonna be okay.

429
00:20:58,048 --> 00:20:59,338
You told us.

430
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:04,470
Hey, Doc?

431
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:07,575
- Did you say something?
- Yeah.

432
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:09,279
I'm sorry,
I just realized what time it is.

433
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:12,309
I have to... I have to get back.
I don't have time to get coffee.

434
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:14,436
- Oh. Of course. Of course.
- Sorry.

435
00:21:44,344 --> 00:21:45,554
Oh, you got company.

436
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:47,601
Yeah. Um...

437
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:50,138
Uh... Don't worry. Unlike Hope,

438
00:21:50,225 --> 00:21:52,725
I believe the less I know,
the happier I'll be.

439
00:21:53,937 --> 00:21:55,977
- Okay. Thank you.
- Uh-huh.

440
00:21:58,358 --> 00:21:59,818
- I'll see ya tomorrow.
- Uh-huh.

441
00:22:04,948 --> 00:22:05,868
Hey.

442
00:22:05,949 --> 00:22:06,949
Whose truck is that?

443
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:08,542
It's Jeb's.

444
00:22:08,952 --> 00:22:09,872
Is everything okay?

445
00:22:09,953 --> 00:22:10,953
Um...

446
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:14,122
I should just tell you on the way. It's...

447
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:17,213
I still have to get ready, and you know.

448
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:19,504
- Yeah. Take your time.
- Okay. You look nice.

449
00:22:20,797 --> 00:22:21,837
Thank you.

450
00:23:18,271 --> 00:23:19,271
Wow.

451
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:25,452
I thought we'd, um...

452
00:23:27,447 --> 00:23:30,777
head over to Eureka,
away from any prying eyes.

453
00:23:31,368 --> 00:23:33,868
Oh. You thought of everything,
didn't you?

454
00:23:35,956 --> 00:23:36,956
No pressure.

455
00:23:37,457 --> 00:23:38,497
Right.

456
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:39,673
Just like I promised.

457
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:41,752
Okay.

458
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:43,546
Just dinner.

459
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:44,588
Right.

460
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:57,266
I can't believe we're only two hours
from Virgin River.

461
00:23:58,103 --> 00:24:00,063
It's a whole other world here, huh?

462
00:24:00,897 --> 00:24:01,897
Yeah.

463
00:24:03,358 --> 00:24:04,938
It's really a beautiful night.

464
00:24:06,528 --> 00:24:08,778
Well, wait till you taste the food.
They, uh...

465
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:10,741
have a Michelin star.

466
00:24:11,324 --> 00:24:12,994
Ooh, impressive.

467
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:15,452
Well, that was the plan.

468
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:23,964
Damn it, Brady. What the hell?

469
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:25,878
Take it out of my pay.

470
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:29,094
No. You know what?
The toilet in the men's room is backed up.

471
00:24:29,176 --> 00:24:30,836
Sounds nasty. Better get on that.

472
00:24:31,219 --> 00:24:32,929
- Brady.
- Come on, man. How's that my job?

473
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:35,473
- Get Ricky to do it.
- So what, you think that's beneath you?

474
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:37,597
Yeah. As a matter of fact, I do.

475
00:24:37,684 --> 00:24:40,984
Well, from where I'm standin',
that is exactly where you belong.

476
00:24:42,772 --> 00:24:43,772
No.

477
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:46,029
Brady, I wasn't askin'.

478
00:24:46,693 --> 00:24:49,863
You know, I'm sick of you bossing me
around, thinking you're better than me.

479
00:24:49,946 --> 00:24:51,196
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

480
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:54,527
- You had it out for me the minute I came.
- That's because you...

481
00:24:54,618 --> 00:24:56,538
you are unreliable,
you are insubordinate,

482
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,870
and I wasn't convinced
that you had changed.

483
00:24:58,955 --> 00:25:00,285
And it seems like I'm right.

484
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:04,464
I'm not interested in cleaning up other
people's crap for the rest of my life.

485
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:07,593
That might be enough for you,
but it isn't for me.

486
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:09,762
At least I never got a man killed.

487
00:25:14,095 --> 00:25:15,135
Leave that alone.

488
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:17,892
I lost two ribs and a kidney
because of you.

489
00:25:18,391 --> 00:25:21,351
Lonergan is dead because of you.

490
00:25:21,686 --> 00:25:22,686
And Jack...

491
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:28,188
Ah, don't even know.

492
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:30,612
I don't even know why I bother.

493
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:33,946
You didn't care then,
you... you don't care now.

494
00:25:34,449 --> 00:25:35,779
You are nothing...

495
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:38,582
but a damned liability.

496
00:25:53,843 --> 00:25:57,223
Okay, uh...
I've been meaning to ask you this.

497
00:25:57,305 --> 00:26:00,265
- Hm?
- I noticed that your bedside reading

498
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:01,560
- is Kierkegaard.
- Oh...

499
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:04,190
- That surprised you?
- No.

500
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:06,981
No, it didn't surprise me. Um...

501
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:11,695
I took a few philosophy courses
in college, and I really liked him.

502
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:14,468
- Yeah.
- What did you like about him?

503
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:17,371
He's, um... a rebel philosopher.

504
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:21,579
You know, it wasn't just that he disagreed
with what everyone was saying,

505
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:24,642
but he thought they were ridiculous
because they were so sure of themselves.

506
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:28,086
And I loved how he thought trying
to predict how life was gonna play out

507
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:31,759
was impossible 'cause you can
never really account for free will, right?

508
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,010
Not everyone's free will.

509
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:34,091
Right.

510
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:35,681
But what about fate?

511
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:40,310
Well, isn't fate ultimately
just a collection of everybody's choices?

512
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:42,310
No, I... I have to disagree.

513
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:45,352
Okay.

514
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,360
We're here right now,

515
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:52,112
experiencing this moment,

516
00:26:52,569 --> 00:26:53,989
and that wasn't inevitable.

517
00:26:55,488 --> 00:26:56,738
I chose to be here.

518
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:03,369
I like it
when you put it like that.

519
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:07,673
Well, I think...

520
00:27:08,918 --> 00:27:11,668
I chose to move to Virgin River.

521
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:19,511
- Right?
- But I think it was fate

522
00:27:19,596 --> 00:27:21,426
that I saw Hope's ad,

523
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:24,927
and so it was both of those things

524
00:27:25,393 --> 00:27:28,063
that led me to be in this moment with you.

525
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:36,910
But was it fate or coincidence
that you saw the ad?

526
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:39,409
Maybe it was serendipity.

527
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:42,655
- I like that.
- Mm-hm.

528
00:27:47,624 --> 00:27:50,004
Well, whatever it was, I'm...

529
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:52,956
I'm grateful that you did, um...

530
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:56,380
I'm glad that we're here.

531
00:28:00,637 --> 00:28:02,467
I really like talking with you.

532
00:28:06,476 --> 00:28:08,516
I really like talking to you, too.

533
00:28:10,397 --> 00:28:14,227
While I would love
to spend the rest of the evening

534
00:28:14,317 --> 00:28:16,697
debating the finer points
of free will and fate...

535
00:28:16,778 --> 00:28:19,488
- I think our waitress wants to go home.
- Oh.

536
00:28:21,157 --> 00:28:22,327
Ah.

537
00:28:23,993 --> 00:28:25,833
Well, we should go for a walk.

00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:34,227
Hey, uh... I know.

542
00:29:35,064 --> 00:29:38,694
I know. I'm... I'm sorry, but I...
I just really need to speak to you.

543
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:40,697
Ah, can't it wait until morning?

544
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:43,782
It's just I gotta...
I gotta get somethin' off my chest.

545
00:29:45,533 --> 00:29:48,503
Uh, Christopher's asleep,
so how about I come by the bar tomorrow?

546
00:29:48,578 --> 00:29:49,578
- Okay?
- Hey...

547
00:29:52,582 --> 00:29:54,382
I know your real name's Michelle.

548
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:57,416

550
00:29:59,589 --> 00:30:02,469
I know that you would never,
ever hurt Christopher.

551
00:30:05,178 --> 00:30:06,298
I want to help you.

552
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:11,683
I just... I just need you to trust me.

553
00:30:20,276 --> 00:30:21,896
I will come by the bar tomorrow,

554
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:24,566
