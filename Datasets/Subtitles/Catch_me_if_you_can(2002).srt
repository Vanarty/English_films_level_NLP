3
00:03:08,272 --> 00:03:11,023
Thank you very much
and welcome to To Tell the Truth.

4
00:03:11,108 --> 00:03:15,528
Our first guest, he's made a career out
of being the most outrageous impostor

5
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:19,782
that we've ever come across
on this show. You'll see what I mean.

6
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:22,368
Number One,
what is your name, please?

7
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:24,453
My name is Frank William Abagnale.

8
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:27,957
- Number Two?
- My name is Frank William Abagnale.

9
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:31,460
- Number Three?
- My name is Frank William Abagnale.

10
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:34,380
From 1964 to 1967,

11
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:38,551
I successfully impersonated
an airline pilot for Pan Am Airways,

12
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:41,470
and I flew over two million miles
for free.

13
00:03:41,597 --> 00:03:42,722
During that time,

14
00:03:42,806 --> 00:03:46,726
I was also the Chief Resident
Pediatrician at a Georgia hospital

15
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:50,229
and an Assistant Attorney General
for the State of Louisiana.

16
00:03:50,314 --> 00:03:51,898
By the time I was caught,

17
00:03:51,982 --> 00:03:56,402
I was considered the youngest and most
daring con man in U.S. history.

18
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:59,655
I had cashed almost $4 million
in fraudulent checks

19
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:02,992
in 26 foreign countries and all 50 states.

20
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:06,329
And I did it all before my 19th birthday.

21
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:09,665
My name is Frank William Abagnale.

22
00:04:14,171 --> 00:04:16,923
So, for the first time,
he'll have to tell the truth.

23
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:19,091
We'll start our questioning with Kitty.

24
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:21,928
Thank you. Number One,
why, with all your talent,

25
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:24,096
and you're obviously
a very bright fellow,

26
00:04:24,181 --> 00:04:27,475
why didn't you go in for
a legitimate profession?

27
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:29,769
It was a question of dollars and cents.

28
00:04:29,853 --> 00:04:31,729
When I was a young man,
I needed the money,

29
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:34,523
and I thought this list of careers was
the easiest way to get it.

30
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:38,444
I see. Number Two,
I find this all very fascinating.

31
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:41,155
Who was it that finally caught you?

32
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:43,699
His name was Carl Hanratty.

33
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:48,746
Hanratty.

34
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:53,793
I am.

35
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:55,836
Carl Hanratty.

36
00:04:55,921 --> 00:04:59,507
I represent the F.B.I.
from the United States of America.

37
00:05:02,052 --> 00:05:05,304
I have orders to see
the American prisoner, Abagnale.

38
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:35,668
You sit here.

39
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:38,963
You do not open the door.

40
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:41,966
You do not pass him

41
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:45,302
anything through the hole.

42
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:58,566
Aw, Jesus.

43
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:21,047
You know,
I've got a little bit of a cold myself.

44
00:06:22,257 --> 00:06:25,092
Frank, I'm here to read
the articles of extradition

45
00:06:25,177 --> 00:06:27,970
according to the European Court
for Human Rights.

46
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:29,388
"Article One,"

47
00:06:29,473 --> 00:06:32,767
"extradition shall be granted
in respect of offenses..."

48
00:06:32,851 --> 00:06:38,314
Help me.

49
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:42,026
Frank, stop it.

50
00:06:42,611 --> 00:06:43,903
Help me.

51
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,574
You don't think
you're actually going to fool me, do you?

52
00:06:50,327 --> 00:06:53,496
Sixteen pages to go.
Stay with me. "Article Two",

53
00:06:53,622 --> 00:06:56,749
"if the request for extradition
includes separate offenses..."

54
00:06:56,833 --> 00:07:01,003
"...each of which is punishable under
the laws of the requesting party..."

55
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:03,522
Frank?

56
00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:08,844
God damn it!

57
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:12,181
Get me a doctor in here!
I need a doctor!

58
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:14,266
- Yes.
- Doctor! Now!

59
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:16,936
Don't sweat it.
We'll get you right to a doctor.

60
00:07:21,483 --> 00:07:24,944
If you can hear me, don't worry.
I'll take you home in the morning.

61
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:27,196
Home in the morning, Frank.

62
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:33,452
- What are you doing?
- Washing off the lice.

63
00:07:33,537 --> 00:07:36,789
This man has to be on a plane
for America. He has to see a doctor.

64
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:38,958
Yes, the doctor comes in tomorrow.

65
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:42,378
I've worked too long, too hard,
for you to take this away from me.

66
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:45,297
If he dies, I'm holding you responsible.

67
00:07:58,061 --> 00:07:59,311
Oh, Frank.

68
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:43,355
Okay, Carl,

69
00:08:43,732 --> 00:08:45,274
let's go home.

70
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:48,360
The New Rochelle Rotary Club

71
00:08:48,445 --> 00:08:51,363
has a history that goes back to 1919.

72
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:53,866
In all those years,

73
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:57,369
we've only seen a handful
of deserving gentlemen

74
00:08:57,454 --> 00:08:59,747
inducted as lifetime members.

75
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:04,710
It's an honor that has seen 57 names

76
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,962
enshrined on the wall of honor.

77
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:09,256
And tonight, we make it 58.

78
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:11,800
So please stand

79
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:16,430
as I present my very good friend,
a man who keeps our pencils sharp

80
00:09:16,932 --> 00:09:18,766
and our pens in ink.

81
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:21,477
Frank William Abagnale.

82
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,915
I stand here, humbled

83
00:09:43,667 --> 00:09:46,585
by the presence of
Mayor Robert Wagner

84
00:09:50,632 --> 00:09:53,968
and our club president, Jack Barnes.

85
00:09:58,807 --> 00:10:02,434
Most of all, I'm honored to see
my loving wife, Paula

86
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:08,190
and my son, Frank, Jr.

87
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:09,692
Come on.

88
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:17,783
Sitting in the front row.

89
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:26,041
Two little mice fell in a bucket of cream.

90
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:30,671
The first mouse quickly gave up
and drowned.

91
00:10:31,548 --> 00:10:33,382
The second mouse

92
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:35,301
wouldn't quit.

93
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:37,678
He struggled so hard

94
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:40,973
that eventually he churned that cream
into butter

95
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:42,808
and crawled out.

96
00:10:43,226 --> 00:10:47,062
Gentlemen, as of this moment,
I am that second mouse.

97
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:07,166
You're a better dancer
than your father.

98
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:09,084
- Hear that, Daddy?
- Like fun.

99
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:10,627
The girls don't know
what they're in for.

100
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,964
Show him the dance you were doing
when we met.

101
00:11:14,049 --> 00:11:15,758
Oh, who can remember?

102
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:20,346
The people in that little French village
were so happy to see Americans,

103
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:23,015
they decided to put on a show for us.

104
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:26,852
- So they crammed 200 soldiers...
- We know the story, Daddy.

105
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:29,021
Into that tiny social hall,

106
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:32,191
and the first person to walk on stage
is your mother

107
00:11:32,275 --> 00:11:34,276
and she starts to dance.

108
00:11:34,611 --> 00:11:36,945
You know, it had been months

109
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:40,699
since we'd seen a woman,
and here's this blond angel.

110
00:11:40,784 --> 00:11:42,534
Blond bombshell.

111
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:47,456
And the men
are literally holding their breath.

112
00:11:47,582 --> 00:11:50,584
Holding their breath for you. Hear that?

113
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:54,129
I turned to my buddies and I said...

114
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:56,799
"I will not leave France without her."

115
00:11:56,925 --> 00:11:58,384
And I didn't.

116
00:11:58,468 --> 00:11:59,927
You didn't.

117
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:01,970
I didn't.

118
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:04,765
Oh, shit, the rug.

119
00:12:05,308 --> 00:12:06,975
- Oh, Mom.
- I can't believe I...

120
00:12:07,102 --> 00:12:08,060
It's nothing.

121
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:10,396
- Frankie, run and get a towel.
- Yeah.

122
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,772
Come on.

123
00:12:16,653 --> 00:12:18,487
Dance with me, Paula.

124
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:32,292
Whenever I dance for you,
I get in trouble.

125
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:44,346
Oh!

126
00:12:46,141 --> 00:12:48,600
Frank. Wake up. Come on, let's go.

127
00:12:48,685 --> 00:12:50,352
Get up, come on.

128
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:53,272
- Frank, wake up.
- Dad.

129
00:12:53,523 --> 00:12:55,941
You don't have to go to school today.
It's okay.

130
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:59,194
- Why? Is it snowing?
- Do you have a black suit?

131
00:12:59,362 --> 00:13:01,363
I overslept again.

132
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:04,700
We have a very important meeting
in the city. Eat that.

133
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:06,034
Come on.

134
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:08,787
Ma'am, open up, please.
It's important.

135
00:13:08,872 --> 00:13:11,457
What? Oh, gosh.

136
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:15,461
- We don't open for half an hour.
- Just open the door. It's important.

137
00:13:15,545 --> 00:13:17,796
I'm sorry, we don't open for half an hour.

138
00:13:17,881 --> 00:13:19,465
What's your name, ma'am?

139
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:22,134
- Darcy.
- Darcy. That's a pretty name.

140
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:25,554
I'm in a fix. I need a suit for my kid.
This is my son, Frank.

141
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,306
He needs a black suit.

142
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:31,727
There was a death in the family.
My father, 85 years old, war hero.

143
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:34,980
There's a funeral this afternoon,
military funeral,

144
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:38,150
planes flying overhead, 21 -gun salute.

145
00:13:38,401 --> 00:13:41,487
Frank needs to borrow a suit
for a couple of hours.

146
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:44,239
I'm sorry,
we don't loan suits and we're not open.

147
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:46,658
Darcy, please. Come back.

148
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:50,537
Darcy, is this yours?

149
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:58,712
I just found it in the parking lot.

150
00:13:59,214 --> 00:14:00,464
Uh-huh.

151
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:03,884
Must have slipped right off your neck.

152
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:08,263
Don't hit the curb.

153
00:14:12,936 --> 00:14:16,647
Now get out, walk around the back
and hold the door open for me.

154
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:30,118
- What's next?
- Okay. Stop grinning.

155
00:14:30,245 --> 00:14:33,372
When I get inside,
go back to the front seat and wait.

156
00:14:33,456 --> 00:14:35,707
Even if a cop comes
and writes you a ticket,

157
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:37,876
don't move the car, understood?

158
00:14:37,961 --> 00:14:39,711
Dad, what's all this for?

159
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:41,922
You know why the Yankees always win?

160
00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:43,715
Because they have Mickey Mantle?

161
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:47,719
No, it's because the other teams can't
stop staring at those damn pinstripes.

162
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:51,306
Watch this. The manager
of Chase Manhattan Bank

163
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:54,810
is about to open the door for your father.

164
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:58,480
Mr. Abagnale,

165
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:01,233
we don't usually loan money to people

166
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:03,902
who have unresolved business
with the IRS.

167
00:15:03,987 --> 00:15:07,155
That's a misunderstanding.
I hired the wrong guy to do my books.

168
00:15:07,282 --> 00:15:09,491
A mistake anybody could make.

169
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:12,327
I just need you guys
to help me weather the storm.

170
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:15,330
You're being investigated
by the government for tax fraud.

171
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:17,916
My store is
a landmark in New Rochelle.

172
00:15:18,001 --> 00:15:20,168
I have customers all over New York.

173
00:15:20,503 --> 00:15:22,379
You're not a customer
at Chase Manhattan.

174
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:23,589
We don't know you.

175
00:15:23,673 --> 00:15:26,675
I'm sure your bank in New Rochelle
could help you out.

176
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,343
My bank went out of business.

177
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:30,679
Banks like this one
put them out of business.

178
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:35,100
I know I made a mistake, I admit that.
But these people want blood.

179
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:38,979
They want my store.
They've threatened to put me in jail.

180
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:42,858
This is America, right?
I'm not a criminal.

181
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:46,528
I'm a Medal of Honor winner. A member
of the New Rochelle Rotary Club.

182
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:50,157
All I'm asking is
for you to help me beat these guys.

183
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:53,869
It's not a question of winning and losing,
it's a question of risk.

184
00:15:54,871 --> 00:15:58,373
You're the largest bank in the world.
Where's the...

185
00:15:59,334 --> 00:16:01,043
Where's the risk?

186
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:08,717
How could you let him
take our car like that?

187
00:16:08,843 --> 00:16:12,638
He didn't take anything, we took him.
He overpaid by 500.

188
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:16,391
Come on, Frank. Let's return the suit.

189
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,818
This place is good.

190
00:16:26,903 --> 00:16:30,072
It's small, but it's gonna be
a lot less work.

191
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,783
A lot less work for you.

192
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:57,140
Hey, Dad.

193
00:16:58,017 --> 00:16:59,101
Hi.

194
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:04,648
Where is your mother?

195
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:07,359
I don't know.

196
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:11,113
She said something
about going to look for a job.

197
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:15,701
What's she going to be,
a shoe salesman at a centipede farm?

198
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:23,083
What are you doing?

199
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:26,253
You want some pancakes?

200
00:17:26,337 --> 00:17:29,506
For dinner? On my son's 16th birthday?

201
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:32,008
We're not going to eat pancakes.

202
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:38,098
Why are you looking at me like that?
You thought I forgot?

203
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:41,268
- I didn't think you forgot.
- I opened a checking account

204
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:46,398
I put $25 in the account
so you can buy whatever you want.

205
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:48,650
- Don't tell your mother.
- I won't.

206
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:50,193
Thanks, Dad.

207
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:53,822
Didn't that bank turn you down
for a loan?

208
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:56,199
Yes, they all turned me down.

209
00:17:56,868 --> 00:17:58,660
Then why you opening
a banking account with them?

210
00:17:58,745 --> 00:18:01,580
Because one day, you'll want
something from these people.

211
00:18:01,664 --> 00:18:03,415
A house, a car...

212
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:05,917
They have all the money.

213
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:12,048
There's 50 checks there, Frank,

214
00:18:12,133 --> 00:18:14,551
which means, from this day on,

215
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:19,181
you're in their little club.

216
00:18:19,682 --> 00:18:21,767
I'm in their little club.

217
00:18:22,393 --> 00:18:24,686
You got that, you got it all.

218
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:27,189
It's even got my name there.

219
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:31,693
- To the moon.
- To the moon.

220
00:18:32,737 --> 00:18:34,196
To the moon.

221
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:45,540
See that? It's just a school.

222
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:48,376
No different than Westbourne.

223
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:51,338
Ma, you said you were going to quit.

224
00:18:55,009 --> 00:18:58,303
Frankie, you don't have to wear
the uniform here.

225
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:02,015
Why don't you take off yourjacket?

226
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:03,934
I'm used to it.

227
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,982
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

228
00:19:11,067 --> 00:19:12,943
Do you know where room 17,
French is?

229
00:19:13,027 --> 00:19:14,152
Yeah...

230
00:19:28,793 --> 00:19:30,502
You selling encyclopedias?

231
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:33,171
He looks like a substitute teacher.

232
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:50,647
Quiet down, people!

233
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,983
My name is Mr. Abagnale!

234
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:56,695
That's Abagnale, not Abagnolee,

235
00:19:56,821 --> 00:19:59,698
not Abagnelee, but Abagnale.

236
00:20:00,825 --> 00:20:05,078
Now, somebody please tell me
where you left off in your textbooks.

237
00:20:05,788 --> 00:20:07,747
Excuse me, people.
If I need to ask again,

238
00:20:07,832 --> 00:20:09,165
I'm gonna write up the entire class.

239
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,917
Take your seats!

240
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:17,090
Chapter seven.

241
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:19,926
Would you please open your textbooks
to chapter eight

242
00:20:20,011 --> 00:20:21,928
and we'll get started.

243
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:24,681
- Excuse me. What's your name?
- Brad.

244
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:26,308
Why don't you get up here

245
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:30,145
in front of the class
and read conversation number five?

246
00:20:44,911 --> 00:20:46,578
They sent for me.

247
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:49,539
They said they needed
a sub for Roberta.

248
00:20:49,707 --> 00:20:52,042
I came all the way from Dixon.

249
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:55,378
I always sub for Roberta.

250
00:20:55,463 --> 00:20:57,672
Excuse me, why aren't you reading?

251
00:20:59,133 --> 00:21:02,552
I'll never come back
to Bellarmine-Jefferson again!

252
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:04,596
You tell them not to call me.

253
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,057
Do they think it's easy
for a woman my age

254
00:21:07,141 --> 00:21:10,769
and all the money that it costs to travel?
I tell you, they don't give a damn.

255
00:21:10,853 --> 00:21:12,437
Mr. and Mrs. Abagnale,

256
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:15,315
this is not a question
of your son's attendance.

257
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:18,401
I regret to inform you
that for the past week,

258
00:21:18,486 --> 00:21:22,072
Frank has been teaching
Mrs. Glasser's French class.

259
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:25,241
He what?

260
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:29,496
Your son has been pretending to be
a substitute teacher.

261
00:21:29,747 --> 00:21:33,166
Lecturing the students,
giving out homework...

262
00:21:33,668 --> 00:21:35,835
Mrs. Glasser has been ill,

263
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:39,089
and there was some confusion
with the real sub.

264
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:43,176
Your son held
a teacher-parent conference yesterday

265
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:45,595
and was planning a class field trip

266
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:48,390
to a French bread factory in Trenton.

267
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:51,810
Do you see the problem we have?

268
00:21:53,688 --> 00:21:57,732
I've a note to miss fifth and sixth period
today. Doctor's appointment.

269
00:21:57,817 --> 00:22:00,402
One moment. I'll be right with you.

270
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:05,281
- You should fold it.
- What?

271
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:08,827
That note. It's a fake, right?
You should fold it.

272
00:22:08,911 --> 00:22:11,705
It's a note from my mom.
I have a doctor's appointment.

273
00:22:11,789 --> 00:22:14,624
Yeah, but there's no crease
in the paper.

274
00:22:14,709 --> 00:22:16,543
When your mom hands you a note
to miss school,

275
00:22:16,627 --> 00:22:20,547
the first thing you do is fold it
and put it in your pocket.

276
00:22:20,631 --> 00:22:23,133
If it's real, where's the crease?

277
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:34,185
Frankie.

278
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:51,536
Ma, I'm home.

279
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:57,876
Remember that girl Joanna
I was telling you about?

280
00:22:58,252 --> 00:23:00,170
I asked her out today.

281
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:04,340
Think we're going to go
to the junior prom.

282
00:23:05,134 --> 00:23:07,844
Ma, is this my driver's license?

283
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:10,472
That's all there is, two bedrooms.

284
00:23:10,598 --> 00:23:11,890
Frankie.

285
00:23:12,016 --> 00:23:14,142
You remember Dad's friend?

286
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,853
Jack Barnes. From the club.

287
00:23:17,146 --> 00:23:18,104
Hello.

288
00:23:18,189 --> 00:23:20,398
He came by looking for your father.

289
00:23:20,483 --> 00:23:23,026
I was giving him a tour of the apartment.

290
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:26,029
It's very spacious, Paula.

291
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:33,661
Dad is at the store.

292
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:35,872
So, Frank,

293
00:23:36,749 --> 00:23:40,418
you're getting to look
more like your old man every day.

294
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:44,756
Thanks for the sandwich, Paula.

295
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:47,801
- I'll see you later.
- Wait.

296
00:23:53,307 --> 00:23:54,849
Is this yours?

297
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:56,476
Oh.

298
00:23:57,728 --> 00:24:00,688
Thanks, Frank.
That's the President's pin.

299
00:24:02,066 --> 00:24:04,818
I'd be in deep trouble if I lost that.

300
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:12,575
I'll see you all later.

301
00:24:22,378 --> 00:24:25,713
Are you hungry, Frankie?
I'll make you a sandwich.

302
00:24:34,682 --> 00:24:37,809
Jack wanted to talk business
with your father.

303
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:42,689
He thinks we should get a lawyer
and sue the government.

304
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:46,651
That it's not legal,
what they're doing to us.

305
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:51,865
Why aren't you saying anything?

306
00:24:58,122 --> 00:25:01,082
You're not going to tell him, are you?

307
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:03,710
No.

308
00:25:04,587 --> 00:25:07,338
That's right. There's nothing to tell.

309
00:25:08,591 --> 00:25:13,052
I'm going out for a few hours to visit
some old friends from the tennis club.

310
00:25:13,137 --> 00:25:16,389
When I get home,
we'll all have dinner together.

311
00:25:16,724 --> 00:25:17,974
Right?

312
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:22,437
But you won't say anything
because it's just silly,

313
00:25:22,563 --> 00:25:23,897
isn't it?

314
00:25:24,398 --> 00:25:26,482
How could we sue anybody?

315
00:25:32,198 --> 00:25:34,616
Do you need some money, Frankie?

316
00:25:35,034 --> 00:25:38,119
A few dollars to buy
some record albums?

317
00:25:38,454 --> 00:25:40,580
Here. Take $5.

318
00:25:42,249 --> 00:25:43,458
Or 10.

319
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:51,966
You promised you were going to quit.

320
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:12,487
Ma, I'm home.

321
00:26:27,461 --> 00:26:28,670
Hey, hey!

322
00:26:28,754 --> 00:26:30,546
You stay away from me. You hear me?

323
00:26:30,631 --> 00:26:33,341
I don't know who you are,
but if you come back here...

324
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:36,427
Frank, calm down, will you?
I'm Dick Keener.

325
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:40,890
I want you to leave your things here,
follow me into the next room.

326
00:26:40,975 --> 00:26:43,518
Okay? They're all waiting for you.

327
00:26:45,771 --> 00:26:48,398
You don't have to be scared.
I'm right here, Frank.

328
00:26:48,482 --> 00:26:50,275
I'll always be here.

329
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:54,445
But there are laws. Everything in
this country has to be legal.

330
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:57,282
So what we need to do
is make some decisions.

331
00:26:57,366 --> 00:26:58,825
That's what Mr. Keener is here for.

332
00:26:58,909 --> 00:27:01,619
Many times these decisions
are left up to the courts.

333
00:27:01,704 --> 00:27:04,747
But that can be very expensive,
people fighting over their children.

334
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:06,082
Nobody is fighting.

335
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:08,918
Look at me, Frank. Nobody is fighting.

336
00:27:17,678 --> 00:27:21,597
Do you remember your grandma? Eve?
She arrived this morning.

337
00:27:21,682 --> 00:27:23,516
Hello.

338
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:36,112
Do you understand
what we're saying to you, Frank?

339
00:27:37,406 --> 00:27:40,658
Your father and I are getting a divorce.

340
00:27:43,996 --> 00:27:46,706
Nothing's going to change.
We're still gonna see each other.

341
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:50,376
- Stop it, please. Don't interrupt.
- You don't have to read all of this.

342
00:27:50,461 --> 00:27:53,212
Most of it is for your parents,
boring adult business.

343
00:27:53,297 --> 00:27:55,923
But this paragraph right here,
this is important

344
00:27:56,008 --> 00:27:59,177
because it states
who you're gonna live with

345
00:28:00,304 --> 00:28:01,763
after the divorce.

346
00:28:01,847 --> 00:28:03,723
Whose custody you will be in.

347
00:28:03,807 --> 00:28:06,434
And there's a blank space right here.

348
00:28:07,811 --> 00:28:11,147
I want you to go into the kitchen,
sit at the table

349
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:12,732
and put a name down.

350
00:28:12,816 --> 00:28:13,983
You can take as long as you want,

351
00:28:14,068 --> 00:28:15,610
but when you come back into this room,

352
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:18,196
I want to see a name on that line.

353
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:22,116
Frank, just write down
a name and this will all be over.

354
00:28:22,326 --> 00:28:23,868
It's going to be okay.

355
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:25,620
Dad, what name?

356
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:26,996
Your mother or your father.

357
00:28:27,081 --> 00:28:29,957
Just put the name there.
It's as simple as that.

358
00:28:30,042 --> 00:28:33,252
And don't look so scared. It's not a test.

359
00:28:34,004 --> 00:28:36,089
There's no wrong answer.

360
00:28:50,771 --> 00:28:52,647
One ticket to Grand Central, please.

361
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:54,774
That will be $3.50, sir.

362
00:28:56,026 --> 00:28:58,569
Is it okay if I write you a check?

363
00:29:03,784 --> 00:29:06,202
Carl, when do I get to call my father?

364
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:09,247
You can call him when we get
to New York.

365
00:29:09,331 --> 00:29:11,499
We leave for the airport in seven hours.

366
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,128
Until then, just sit there.

367
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:16,629
Be quiet.

368
00:29:17,714 --> 00:29:21,509
On the other side of the hotel,
they got suites that face the park.

369
00:29:22,886 --> 00:29:25,638
It's the best room the F.B.I. can afford.

370
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:30,893
It's okay, I've stayed in worse.

371
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:33,312
Please. You have to listen.

372
00:29:33,397 --> 00:29:36,732
I don't want to hear your story.
Two checks bounced.

373
00:29:36,817 --> 00:29:38,609
You know how much trouble I'm in?

374
00:29:38,694 --> 00:29:41,195
No, but listen. I'm telling you.
The bank, they made the mistake.

375
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,905
I'll write you another check right now!

376
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:45,032
What? Do I look like
I was born yesterday?

377
00:29:45,117 --> 00:29:47,994
Look, it's midnight.
Where am I going to go?

378
00:29:48,078 --> 00:29:50,413
You're a goddamn kid. Go home.

379
00:30:38,629 --> 00:30:42,173
I hope you understand. My boss
sent me to Brooklyn, then Queens.

380
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:43,716
Now he wants me in Long Island

381
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:46,594
to take a few clients out
for a night on the town.

382
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:50,598
I'm sorry, but we're not allowed
to cash checks from other banks.

383
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:53,601
- How would we know if they were good?
- What did you say your name was?

384
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:55,394
- Ashley.
- Ashley.

385
00:30:55,479 --> 00:30:58,731
You know what I found
on the sidewalk out there?

386
00:31:03,654 --> 00:31:06,405
Must have slipped right off your neck.

387
00:31:10,536 --> 00:31:13,579
Is there something
I can help you with, son?

388
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:15,957
It's my grandmother's birthday
next week

389
00:31:16,041 --> 00:31:18,668
and I want to get her something
extra special.

390
00:31:18,752 --> 00:31:22,588
Please, it's my midterm next week
and my books were stolen.

391
00:31:24,341 --> 00:31:27,009
Please, just $5.
No one would have to know.

392
00:31:27,094 --> 00:31:30,471
I'm sorry,
but we are not allowed to take checks

393
00:31:30,556 --> 00:31:32,682
from people we don't know.

394
00:31:55,664 --> 00:31:57,498
Welcome to New York.

395
00:32:14,224 --> 00:32:16,058
Pleasure to have you back, Captain.

396
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:20,271
What do you think, Angelo?
The tomatoes are ripe this afternoon.

397
00:32:27,571 --> 00:32:28,696
What have we here?

398
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,865
- Can I have your autograph?
- You betcha.

399
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:32,992
- Can I have your autograph, too?
- You gonna be a pilot?

400
00:32:33,076 --> 00:32:34,368
Mmm-hmm.

401
00:32:35,037 --> 00:32:36,787
There you go. Work hard in school.

402
00:32:36,872 --> 00:32:38,205
Dear Dad,

403
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:40,791
I've decided to become an airline pilot.

404
00:32:40,876 --> 00:32:42,710
I've applied to all the big airlines,

405
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:45,880
and I have several promising interviews
lined up.

406
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:49,050
How is Mom?
Have you called her lately?

407
00:32:49,134 --> 00:32:51,719
Love, your son, Frank.

408
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:56,599
Hello.

409
00:32:57,392 --> 00:32:59,477
I'm Frank Black
from Murrow High School,

410
00:32:59,561 --> 00:33:02,271
and I have an appointment
with Mr. Morgan.

411
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:05,149
You're the young man who's writing
the article for the school paper.

412
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:06,233
Yes, ma'am. That's me.

413
00:33:06,318 --> 00:33:08,736
I want to know everything there is
to know about being a pilot.

414
00:33:09,571 --> 00:33:13,074
What airports does Pan Am fly to?
What does a pilot make in a year?

415
00:33:13,158 --> 00:33:14,867
Who tells them where they're gonna
fly to?

416
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:17,161
- Slow down. Take them one at a time.
- All right.

417
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:19,997
What does it mean when
one pilot says to another pilot,

418
00:33:20,082 --> 00:33:21,248
"What kind of equipment are you on?"

419
00:33:21,333 --> 00:33:25,169
They want to know what aircraft
you're flying. DC-8, 707, Constellation...

420
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:28,255
And what about those I.D. badges
that I've seen pilots wear?

421
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:30,675
Every pilot must have two things
with him at all times.

422
00:33:30,759 --> 00:33:34,261
One is his airline personnel badge,
looks just like this one from Pan Am.

423
00:33:34,346 --> 00:33:36,931
The other one is their FAA license.

424
00:33:37,182 --> 00:33:39,517
And that looks just like this.

425
00:33:40,602 --> 00:33:41,727
Oh...

426
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:45,064
Do you think I could make a copy
of this to put into my article?

427
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:48,275
Frank, you can have that one,
it's three years expired.

428
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:50,444
Thanks. And what about
your I.D. badge?

429
00:33:50,529 --> 00:33:51,821
Do you have an extra one
I could borrow?

430
00:33:51,947 --> 00:33:53,447
No, I can't help you there.

431
00:33:53,532 --> 00:33:55,032
Those are special-ordered
from Polaroid.

432
00:33:55,117 --> 00:33:57,952
The only way to get one
is to become a real live pilot

433
00:33:58,036 --> 00:33:59,495
for Pan American Airways.

434
00:34:04,501 --> 00:34:06,210
Pan Am, may I help you?

435
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:08,629
Yeah. Hello, I'm calling about a uniform.

436
00:34:08,714 --> 00:34:10,965
- Hold for Purchasing.
- Thank you.

437
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:12,258
Purchasing.

438
00:34:12,342 --> 00:34:15,010
I'm a copilot based out of
San Francisco.

439
00:34:15,137 --> 00:34:17,263
I flew a flight into New York last night,

440
00:34:17,347 --> 00:34:20,641
but the problem is I'm headed out
to Paris in three hours.

441
00:34:20,726 --> 00:34:22,393
How can we help you?

442
00:34:22,477 --> 00:34:25,980
I sent my uniform to be cleaned
through the hotel

443
00:34:26,189 --> 00:34:28,023
and I guess they must have lost it.

444
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:30,443
They lost a uniform.
Happens all the time.

445
00:34:30,527 --> 00:34:33,487
Go down to the Well-Built Uniform
Company at 9th and Broadway.

446
00:34:33,572 --> 00:34:34,655
They're our uniform supplier.

447
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:36,741
I'll tell Mr. Rosen you're coming.

448
00:34:36,825 --> 00:34:38,784
You look too young to be a pilot.

449
00:34:38,869 --> 00:34:40,494
I'm a copilot.

450
00:34:40,829 --> 00:34:42,371
Why so nervous?

451
00:34:42,831 --> 00:34:47,042
How would you feel if you lost
your uniform first week on the job?

452
00:34:47,169 --> 00:34:50,171
Relax.
Pan Am has got lots of uniforms.

453
00:34:50,839 --> 00:34:52,506
It's gonna be $164.

454
00:34:53,383 --> 00:34:55,509
Great. I'll write you a check.

455
00:34:55,594 --> 00:34:57,720
Sorry, no checks, no cash.

456
00:34:57,846 --> 00:35:00,306
You'll have to fill in
your employee I.D. number.

457
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:04,518
I'll bill Pan Am, and they'll take it out
of your next paycheck.

458
00:35:05,854 --> 00:35:07,021
Even better.

459
00:35:09,191 --> 00:35:10,399
Dear Dad,

460
00:35:10,525 --> 00:35:13,569
you always told me
that an honest man has nothing to fear.

461
00:35:13,695 --> 00:35:16,530
So I'm trying my best not to be afraid.

462
00:35:16,698 --> 00:35:19,742
I'm sorry I ran away,
but you don't have to worry.

463
00:35:19,868 --> 00:35:24,205
I'm gonna get it all back now, Daddy.
I promise. I'm gonna get it all back.

464
00:35:30,921 --> 00:35:32,546
Are you a real live pilot?

465
00:35:32,631 --> 00:35:34,882
I sure am, little lady. What's your name?

466
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:37,635
- Celine.
- Celine, it's a pleasure to meet you.

467
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:40,137
It's a pleasure to meet you, too.

468
00:35:43,934 --> 00:35:48,312
That's 50, 70, 80, 90,

469
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:50,147
$100.

470
00:35:50,232 --> 00:35:52,525
You have yourself a great time in Paris.

471
00:35:52,609 --> 00:35:54,068
I always do.

472
00:35:54,653 --> 00:35:56,070
Excuse me.

473
00:35:57,405 --> 00:35:59,406
I'm John Modiger. I manage this branch.

474
00:35:59,491 --> 00:36:01,700
I want to thank you for coming in
and using our institution.

475
00:36:01,785 --> 00:36:03,869
It's a pleasure to meet you, John.
I'll be back again.

476
00:36:03,954 --> 00:36:04,954
Good.

477
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:07,581
Have you stayed with us before?

478
00:36:07,916 --> 00:36:11,168
No, I've been primarily based
on the West Coast.

479
00:36:11,753 --> 00:36:13,671
Is it all right if I write you a check
for the room?

480
00:36:13,755 --> 00:36:15,798
- No problem, sir.
- Great.

481
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:28,435
I was also wondering
if I could write you a personal check?

482
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:31,730
For airline personnel,
we cash personal checks up to $100.

483
00:36:31,815 --> 00:36:33,482
Payroll checks we cash up to 300.

484
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:37,778
Did you say 300 for a payroll check?

485
00:36:42,701 --> 00:36:44,159
Dear Dad,

486
00:36:44,369 --> 00:36:47,746
I've decided to become a pilot
for Pan American Airways,

487
00:36:47,831 --> 00:36:50,249
the most trusted name in the skies.

488
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:54,545
They've accepted me into their training
program and told me if I work hard,

489
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:56,881
I should earn my wings real soon.

490
00:36:56,965 --> 00:37:00,092
Please get in touch with Joanna Carlton
from the 10th grade.

491
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:03,304
Tell her I'm sorry that I could not
take her to the junior prom.

492
00:37:03,388 --> 00:37:05,681
Love, your son, Frank.

493
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:46,430
- Hello, how are you?
- Fine, thank you.

494
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:48,641
I have a payroll check I'd like to cash.

495
00:37:48,725 --> 00:37:50,184
Certainly.

496
00:37:51,895 --> 00:37:53,270
Excuse me.

497
00:37:54,022 --> 00:37:56,023
I'm sure you hear this all the time,

498
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:59,693
but you have the most beautiful eyes
I have ever seen.

499
00:38:00,445 --> 00:38:02,947
Yeah, I do get that all the time.

500
00:38:03,865 --> 00:38:05,366
How would you like it?

501
00:38:20,966 --> 00:38:25,260
I'm sorry, sir. We won't have any cash
until the banks open in an hour.

502
00:38:25,387 --> 00:38:28,889
But I'm sure they can cash your check
at the airport.

503
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:30,891
The airport?

504
00:38:31,017 --> 00:38:33,268
Who cashes checks at the airport?

505
00:38:33,395 --> 00:38:36,897
The airlines.
They've always taken care of their own.

506
00:38:45,782 --> 00:38:48,283
- Hello.
- Hi. Are you deadheading?

507
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:49,952
What?

508
00:38:50,078 --> 00:38:52,413
Are you my deadhead to Miami?

509
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:56,083
Yes.

510
00:38:56,918 --> 00:38:59,586
Yeah, I'm the deadhead. Here you go.

511
00:39:00,213 --> 00:39:03,424
You're a little late,
but the jump seat is open.

512
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:08,804
It's been a while since I've done this.
Which one is the jump seat again?

513
00:39:11,224 --> 00:39:12,975
Have a nice flight.

514
00:39:13,143 --> 00:39:15,060
Are you my deadhead?

515
00:39:17,397 --> 00:39:20,649
Frank, Captain Oliver.
John Larkin, the copilot.

516
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:22,526
Fred Tulley, flight engineer.

517
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:25,362
Frank Taylor, Pan Am.
Thanks for giving me a lift, boys.

518
00:39:25,447 --> 00:39:28,365
Go ahead and take a seat, Frank.
We're about to push.

519
00:39:28,450 --> 00:39:30,617
What kind of equipment you on, DC-8?

520
00:39:30,744 --> 00:39:31,827
707.

521
00:39:32,162 --> 00:39:34,371
You turning around on the redeye?

522
00:39:34,456 --> 00:39:36,790
I'm jumping puddles
for the next few months,

523
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:40,127
trying to earn my keep running
leap frogs for the weak and weary.

524
00:39:40,253 --> 00:39:42,796
No shame in that. We all did it.

525
00:39:49,971 --> 00:39:52,014
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.

526
00:39:53,141 --> 00:39:55,309
Would you like a drink after takeoff?

527
00:39:55,435 --> 00:39:56,602
Milk?

528
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:58,979
- Eighty knots.
- Check.

529
00:39:59,481 --> 00:40:01,106
V-one. Rotate.

530
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:05,986
V-two. Positive rate.

531
00:40:06,112 --> 00:40:07,362
Gear up.

532
00:40:08,156 --> 00:40:10,824
Dear Dad,
today was graduation.

533
00:40:11,367 --> 00:40:15,996
I am now a copilot,
earning $1,400 a month, plus benefits.

534
00:40:16,289 --> 00:40:20,250
And the best part is,
they tell me my family can fly for free.

535
00:40:20,335 --> 00:40:23,212
So tell Mom to pack her bags
and buy a new swimsuit

536
00:40:23,338 --> 00:40:26,715
because I'm taking us all to Hawaii
for Christmas.

537
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:30,219
I love you, Dad. Aloha, Frank.

538
00:40:31,179 --> 00:40:32,596
- Hello, deadhead.
- Hello.

539
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,723
Enjoying your free ride?

540
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:42,022
Marci,

541
00:40:43,233 --> 00:40:45,025
did you drop this?

542
00:40:48,029 --> 00:40:51,031
- Must have slipped right off your neck.
- No.

543
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:53,826
No!

544
00:40:56,204 --> 00:40:59,081
Yes, yes, yes!

545
00:41:06,923 --> 00:41:08,841
Why are you stopping?

546
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:12,886
I want to tell you something, Marci.

547
00:41:14,514 --> 00:41:16,223
This is by far

548
00:41:17,517 --> 00:41:20,561
the best date I have ever been on.

549
00:41:52,635 --> 00:41:55,512
Welcome to Miami Mutual Bank.
How may I help you?

550
00:41:55,597 --> 00:41:58,223
My name is Frank Taylor.
I'm a copilot for Pan Am.

551
00:41:58,308 --> 00:42:01,435
I'd like to cash this check and then

552
00:42:02,437 --> 00:42:04,771
I'd like to take you out for a steak dinner.

553
00:42:15,283 --> 00:42:17,701
Then we feed the checks
into the MICR machine,

554
00:42:17,785 --> 00:42:19,244
which uses special ink to encode

555
00:42:19,329 --> 00:42:22,122
the account numbers
on the bottom of the checks.

556
00:42:22,832 --> 00:42:25,125
And where are these numbers?

557
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:28,962
- They're right here.
- Right there?

558
00:42:32,634 --> 00:42:34,635
They're called routing numbers.

559
00:42:34,761 --> 00:42:37,471
So where do the checks get routed to?

560
00:42:39,015 --> 00:42:42,100
I don't exactly know.
Nobody ever asked me that before.

561
00:42:43,645 --> 00:42:47,064
Our next item up for bid is also from
the Jersey Central Bank foreclosure.

562
00:42:47,148 --> 00:42:50,484
This is a MICR encoder,
a machine used to encode bank checks.

563
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:51,985
Do I have an opening bid?

564
00:42:52,111 --> 00:42:53,904
Our unknown subject
is a paperhanger

565
00:42:53,988 --> 00:42:55,447
who started working on the East Coast.

566
00:42:55,531 --> 00:42:57,241
In the last few weeks,
this unsub has developed

567
00:42:57,325 --> 00:43:00,244
a new form of check fraud
I'm calling "The Float."

568
00:43:00,328 --> 00:43:03,205
What he's doing is he's opening
checking accounts at various banks,

569
00:43:03,331 --> 00:43:06,792
then changing the MICR ink routing
numbers at the bottom of those checks.

570
00:43:06,876 --> 00:43:10,587
Next slide, please. Next slide, please.

571
00:43:11,172 --> 00:43:14,049
The remote thing is broken.
You'll have to do it by hand.

572
00:43:16,344 --> 00:43:19,680
Agent Mullen, it should be
the square button by the side.

573
00:43:19,806 --> 00:43:22,182
This carousel doesn't work.
It's a bad carousel.

574
00:43:22,308 --> 00:43:24,059
- Thank you.
- Move it manually.

575
00:43:24,185 --> 00:43:27,813
This is a map of the 12 banks
of the U.S. Federal Reserve.

576
00:43:27,897 --> 00:43:29,147
Slide.

577
00:43:30,191 --> 00:43:32,526
MICR scanners at every bank
read these numbers

578
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:34,569
at the bottom of the check. Slide.

579
00:43:34,654 --> 00:43:37,990
And then ship that check off
to its corresponding branch.

580
00:43:38,074 --> 00:43:41,576
Carl, for those of us
who are unfamiliar with bank fraud,

581
00:43:41,828 --> 00:43:44,955
you mind telling us
what the hell you're talking about?

582
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:49,126
The East Coast branches
are numbered 01 to 06.

583
00:43:49,210 --> 00:43:51,795
The central branch is 07, 08,
so on and so forth.

584
00:43:51,879 --> 00:43:54,548
You mean those numbers at the bottom
of a check actually mean something?

585
00:43:54,674 --> 00:43:58,635
All of this was in the report I filed
two days ago. If you change

586
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:03,056
a 02 to a 12, that means that check,

587
00:44:03,266 --> 00:44:04,474
which was cashed in New York,

588
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:06,018
does not go
to the New York Federal Branch,

589
00:44:06,102 --> 00:44:10,439
but it is re-routed all the way
to the San Francisco Federal Branch.

590
00:44:10,523 --> 00:44:13,025
The bank doesn't even know
the check has bounced for two weeks.

591
00:44:13,109 --> 00:44:15,736
Which means our unsub
can stay in one place,

592
00:44:15,862 --> 00:44:19,573
paper the same city over and over again
while his checks circle the country.

593
00:44:19,699 --> 00:44:21,908
You want to talk to my wife.

594
00:44:22,410 --> 00:44:24,745
She's the one who balances
the checkbook at our house.

595
00:44:30,209 --> 00:44:31,585
Next slide.

596
00:44:38,718 --> 00:44:39,926
Daddy.

597
00:44:42,263 --> 00:44:44,973
My son, the birdman.
That's some uniform, Frank.

598
00:44:45,099 --> 00:44:46,808
What do you think?

599
00:44:47,477 --> 00:44:48,643
Nice.

600
00:44:48,936 --> 00:44:50,270
Sit down.

601
00:44:53,399 --> 00:44:56,026
Dad, have you gotten the postcards?

602
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:57,361
Of course.

603
00:44:57,445 --> 00:44:58,945
This fork is ice-cold.

604
00:44:59,072 --> 00:45:01,990
No, Dad, that's a chilled salad fork.

605
00:45:03,785 --> 00:45:06,286
It's a fancy restaurant, you know.

606
00:45:11,209 --> 00:45:12,376
Here.

607
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:16,463
- I got you something.
- What's that?

608
00:45:16,589 --> 00:45:17,881
Open it.

609
00:45:23,388 --> 00:45:25,764
You know what those are, right?

610
00:45:26,432 --> 00:45:30,894
Those are the keys
to a 1965 Cadillac DeVille convertible.

611
00:45:30,978 --> 00:45:34,398
Brand-new, Dad.
Red with white interior,

612
00:45:34,482 --> 00:45:37,818
split seats, air conditioning, the works.

613
00:45:38,152 --> 00:45:40,153
Are you giving me a Cadillac?

614
00:45:40,238 --> 00:45:42,322
I'm giving you a Cadillac.

615
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:44,491
Dad, she's parked downstairs.

616
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:47,911
When we're done eating lunch, why
don't you drive on over to Mom's house,

617
00:45:47,995 --> 00:45:49,996
pick her up, take a little joy ride?

618
00:45:50,081 --> 00:45:51,748
Do you know what would happen

619
00:45:51,833 --> 00:45:55,627
if the IRS found out I was driving around
in a new coupe?

620
00:45:57,338 --> 00:46:01,007
I took the train here, Frank.
I'm taking the train home.

621
00:46:03,094 --> 00:46:04,469
All right.

622
00:46:11,686 --> 00:46:13,603
I have plenty of money.

623
00:46:13,688 --> 00:46:16,022
You know, if you ever need anything.

624
00:46:16,149 --> 00:46:18,775
You worried? About me?

625
00:46:19,861 --> 00:46:21,778
No, I'm not worried.

626
00:46:21,863 --> 00:46:23,947
You think I can't buy my own car?

627
00:46:24,031 --> 00:46:27,367
Two mice fell in a bucket
of cream, Frank.

628
00:46:28,369 --> 00:46:29,953
Which one am I?

629
00:46:30,872 --> 00:46:32,956
You're that second mouse.

630
00:46:34,834 --> 00:46:36,960
I went by the store today.

631
00:46:38,296 --> 00:46:41,798
I had to close the store for a while.
It's all about timing, Frank.

632
00:46:41,883 --> 00:46:44,968
Goddamn government knows that.
They hit you when you're down.

633
00:46:45,052 --> 00:46:47,888
I wasn't going to let them take it
from me, so I just

634
00:46:48,014 --> 00:46:50,474
shut the doors myself, called their bluff.

635
00:46:55,563 --> 00:46:58,148
Sooner or later, they'll forget about me.

636
00:46:58,232 --> 00:46:59,733
I understand.

637
00:47:01,569 --> 00:47:03,236
Have you told Ma?

638
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:08,825
She's so stubborn, your mother.

639
00:47:12,497 --> 00:47:15,499
Don't worry, I'm not going to let her go
without a fight.

640
00:47:15,583 --> 00:47:17,542
I'm fighting for us...

641
00:47:20,171 --> 00:47:21,254
Dad?

642
00:47:23,758 --> 00:47:26,176
Since the day we met.

643
00:47:26,761 --> 00:47:29,429
Daddy, out of all those men,

644
00:47:29,931 --> 00:47:32,599
you were the one that took her home,
remember that?

645
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:34,017
Two hundred men

646
00:47:34,101 --> 00:47:37,604
sitting in that tiny social hall,
watching her dance.

647
00:47:40,274 --> 00:47:43,735
- What was the name of that town?
- Montrichard, Dad.

648
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:46,780
I didn't speak a word of French,

649
00:47:46,864 --> 00:47:50,450
and six weeks later, she was my wife.

650
00:47:51,953 --> 00:47:53,620
She is your wife.

651
00:47:56,082 --> 00:48:00,460
My son bought me a Cadillac today.
I think that calls for a toast.

652
00:48:10,304 --> 00:48:12,847
To the best damn pilot in the sky.

653
00:48:13,933 --> 00:48:17,060
It's not what you think. I'm just a copilot.

654
00:48:18,813 --> 00:48:21,439
You see these people staring at you?

655
00:48:24,986 --> 00:48:28,196
These are the most powerful people
in New York City.

656
00:48:28,281 --> 00:48:33,076
They keep peeking over their shoulders,
wondering where you're going tonight.

657
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:35,036
Where you going, Frank?

658
00:48:35,121 --> 00:48:37,372
Dad, nobody's staring at me.

659
00:48:37,832 --> 00:48:39,583
Some place exotic?

660
00:48:41,877 --> 00:48:44,296
Just tell me where you're going.

661
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:48,758
Los... Hollywood.

662
00:48:49,010 --> 00:48:50,385
Hollywood?

663
00:48:53,222 --> 00:48:54,556
Come here.

664
00:48:56,767 --> 00:49:00,103
The rest of us
really are suckers.

665
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:09,154
So I got on this red dress
and these high heels, right?

666
00:49:09,238 --> 00:49:10,822
I got a bra out here.

667
00:49:10,906 --> 00:49:13,450
I'm chasing two Puerto Rican guys
through the park.

668
00:49:13,534 --> 00:49:16,119
They got a suitcase
filled with bank robbery loot.

669
00:49:16,203 --> 00:49:18,705
Okay, I'm screaming out,
"F.B.I., freeze!"

670
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:21,249
I'm reaching for my gun,
but I can't find it in the bra.

671
00:49:21,334 --> 00:49:23,960
It's so damn big,
I thought I was going to shoot my tits off.

672
00:49:27,465 --> 00:49:30,967
That's a funny story.
People always laugh at that story.

673
00:49:31,052 --> 00:49:32,677
Let me ask you a question,
Mr. Amdursky.

674
00:49:32,762 --> 00:49:36,389
If you had so much fun undercover,
why did you transfer to bank fraud?

675
00:49:36,474 --> 00:49:39,768
I didn't transfer.
I was censured and reassigned.

676
00:49:40,353 --> 00:49:43,855
It's like being punished. I was punished.
I screwed up in the field.

677
00:49:43,939 --> 00:49:46,983
What about you, Mr. Fox, were you
punished for screwing up in the field?

678
00:49:47,068 --> 00:49:49,277
No, I've never worked in the field before.

679
00:49:49,362 --> 00:49:50,904
I audited background investigations

680
00:49:50,988 --> 00:49:53,573
of Department of Justice
clerical applicants.

681
00:49:53,658 --> 00:49:58,161
That's just great. I ask for a team
and they drag the bottom of the Pacific.

682
00:49:58,704 --> 00:50:00,997
Mind if I ask you a question,
Agent Hanratty?

683
00:50:01,123 --> 00:50:02,666
How come you're so serious
all the time?

684
00:50:02,750 --> 00:50:05,335
Does it bother you, Mr. Amdursky?

685
00:50:05,419 --> 00:50:07,462
Yeah, it does bother me.

686
00:50:07,797 --> 00:50:09,673
Does it bother you, Mr. Fox?

687
00:50:09,757 --> 00:50:11,508
A little, I guess.

688
00:50:12,551 --> 00:50:15,303
Would you like to hear me tell a joke?

689
00:50:16,597 --> 00:50:19,557
Yeah, we'd love to hear a joke from you.

690
00:50:21,352 --> 00:50:22,727
Knock, knock.

691
00:50:22,812 --> 00:50:24,270
Who's there?

692
00:50:26,941 --> 00:50:28,733
Go fuck yourselves.

693
00:50:42,123 --> 00:50:44,791
He cashed three checks.
They all cleared.

694
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:46,960
I was going to deposit this one today.

695
00:50:48,879 --> 00:50:50,964
I don't want any trouble.

696
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:53,007
No trouble.

697
00:50:53,801 --> 00:50:55,093
No trouble at all.

698
00:50:55,177 --> 00:50:58,304
We'll just take this check
and be on our way. Thank you.

699
00:50:58,389 --> 00:51:00,432
Because I don't want
my customers harassed.

700
00:51:03,561 --> 00:51:06,271
What are you saying? He's still here?

701
00:51:07,022 --> 00:51:08,148
201.

702
00:51:10,359 --> 00:51:11,401
Thank you.

703
00:51:12,486 --> 00:51:14,612
- Corner here.
- Thanks, son.

704
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:18,283
- Some steps.
- Steps.

705
00:51:22,037 --> 00:51:23,997
Mr. Murphy, how are you?

706
00:51:24,081 --> 00:51:25,665
- Is that Frank?
- Yeah, it's Frank.

707
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:27,917
- Hey, Frank. How are you?
- How's the knee?

708
00:51:28,002 --> 00:51:30,170
Come on, I'll race you right now.

709
00:51:30,254 --> 00:51:31,963
- Take care.
- Okay, Frank.

710
00:51:33,132 --> 00:51:34,507
Eyeball the back? Come on, Carl.

711
00:51:34,592 --> 00:51:36,468
This guy's a pen-and-ink man,
a goddamn paperhanger.

712
00:51:36,552 --> 00:51:38,386
Why can't we go with you, Carl?

713
00:51:38,471 --> 00:51:43,057
Keep your eyes open, do your job
and I'll buy you both a Good Humor bar.

714
00:51:52,818 --> 00:51:54,986
It's all right, ma'am. F.B.I.

715
00:51:57,531 --> 00:51:59,657
201.

716
00:52:11,879 --> 00:52:13,087
F.B.I.!

717
00:52:22,223 --> 00:52:23,431
F.B.I.

718
00:52:24,433 --> 00:52:26,518
Come out of the bathroom!

719
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:29,604
Step out of the bathroom!

720
00:52:33,526 --> 00:52:36,236
- Hands on your head.
- That's the new IBM Selectric...

721
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:38,488
- Put your hands on your head!
- ...print type in five seconds...

722
00:52:38,572 --> 00:52:39,823
Shut up!

723
00:52:39,907 --> 00:52:41,866
Put your hands on your head!

724
00:52:41,951 --> 00:52:45,912
He's got over 200 checks,
a gallon of India ink, drafting...

725
00:52:45,996 --> 00:52:48,331
Even has little payroll envelopes
addressed to himself...

726
00:52:48,415 --> 00:52:50,708
- Put it down! Drop it!
- Relax!

727
00:52:51,252 --> 00:52:53,002
You're late, all right?

728
00:52:53,087 --> 00:52:55,880
My name's Barry Allen,
United States Secret Service.

729
00:52:55,965 --> 00:52:57,590
Your boy just tried
to jump out the window.

730
00:52:57,675 --> 00:53:01,177
- My partner has him in custody.
- I don't know what you're talking about.

731
00:53:01,262 --> 00:53:04,848
You think the F.B.I.
are the only ones on this guy? Come on.

732
00:53:04,932 --> 00:53:07,016
He's dabbling in government checks.

733
00:53:07,101 --> 00:53:10,854
We've been following a paper trail
on this guy for months now.

734
00:53:10,938 --> 00:53:13,273
You mind taking that gun
out of my face?

735
00:53:13,357 --> 00:53:15,358
Please. Really. It makes me nervous.

736
00:53:15,484 --> 00:53:17,151
Let me see some credentials.

737
00:53:17,736 --> 00:53:19,153
Yeah, sure.

738
00:53:21,031 --> 00:53:22,907
Take my whole wallet.

739
00:53:23,117 --> 00:53:26,452
You want my gun, too?
Come over here, take my gun.

740
00:53:26,871 --> 00:53:27,954
Hey. Hey, look.

741
00:53:28,038 --> 00:53:31,332
Just do me a favor, take a look outside.
Look out the window.

742
00:53:31,417 --> 00:53:34,544
My partner's walking him to the car
as we speak. Look.

743
00:53:37,464 --> 00:53:40,341
Old guy almost pissed in his pants
when I came through the door.

744
00:53:40,551 --> 00:53:43,928
He jumped right through the window
onto the hood of my car.

745
00:53:44,555 --> 00:53:45,722
Murph?

746
00:53:45,806 --> 00:53:49,559
Call the LAPD. I don't want
people walking through my crime scene.

747
00:53:51,896 --> 00:53:54,689
I didn't expect
the Secret Service on this.

748
00:53:54,815 --> 00:53:57,650
Don't worry about it.
What's your name?

749
00:53:58,193 --> 00:54:00,612
Hanratty, Carl Hanratty.

750
00:54:06,201 --> 00:54:08,786
Mind if I see some identification?

751
00:54:09,622 --> 00:54:12,540
You never can be
too careful these days.

752
00:54:13,584 --> 00:54:15,376
Well, tough luck, Carl.

753
00:54:15,461 --> 00:54:18,087
Five minutes earlier, you would've
landed yourself a pretty good collar.

754
00:54:18,172 --> 00:54:21,090
Is that right? Ten seconds later,
you'd have been shot.

755
00:54:22,509 --> 00:54:25,637
Mind if I come downstairs with you?
I got to take a look at this guy.

756
00:54:25,721 --> 00:54:28,181
Sure thing. Just do me a favor
and sit tight for a sec

757
00:54:28,265 --> 00:54:29,891
while I get this evidence downstairs.

758
00:54:29,975 --> 00:54:33,019
I don't want some maid walking
through here and making the bed.

759
00:54:33,103 --> 00:54:35,688
- LAPD should be here any sec.
- Wait.

760
00:54:40,235 --> 00:54:41,486
Your wallet.

761
00:54:42,363 --> 00:54:45,198
You hang onto it for a minute.
I trust you.

762
00:55:04,510 --> 00:55:06,427
Secret Service.

763
00:55:48,262 --> 00:55:49,387
Hey!

764
00:55:50,973 --> 00:55:52,432
God damn it!

765
00:55:53,976 --> 00:55:56,769
It was stupid. I made a stupid mistake.

766
00:55:57,604 --> 00:55:58,896
Forget about it.

767
00:55:58,981 --> 00:56:01,524
There are hundreds
of unknown subjects out there.

768
00:56:01,608 --> 00:56:05,862
I can get this guy. The worst thing
a paperhanger can do is show his face.

769
00:56:05,946 --> 00:56:07,280
I read the report.

770
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:11,034
Six feet tall, brown hair,
27 to 30 years of age, 160 pounds.

771
00:56:11,118 --> 00:56:12,702
This could be almost anybody.

772
00:56:12,786 --> 00:56:14,871
I heard his voice. I saw his face.

773
00:56:14,955 --> 00:56:16,914
There's nothing for him
to hide behind anymore.

774
00:56:18,375 --> 00:56:19,667
Just be careful.

775
00:56:19,877 --> 00:56:21,794
You got 12 years in.

776
00:56:21,879 --> 00:56:23,588
Nobody bothers you down
on the first floor.

777
00:56:23,672 --> 00:56:25,423
You practically wrote
the book on bank fraud.

778
00:56:25,507 --> 00:56:28,593
That's the kind of thing that can
make you section chief someday.

779
00:56:28,677 --> 00:56:31,971
Just don't put yourself
in this type of position.

780
00:56:32,181 --> 00:56:33,431
What type of position?

781
00:56:35,350 --> 00:56:37,643
The position of being humiliated.

782
00:56:45,903 --> 00:56:48,696
Sean, would you like to hear me
tell a joke?

783
00:56:50,032 --> 00:56:51,365
Yeah. Sure.

784
00:56:52,534 --> 00:56:54,077
Knock, knock.

785
00:56:56,872 --> 00:57:01,375
My next question is,
when a pilot retires,

786
00:57:02,211 --> 00:57:04,796
Pan Am sends them a check
every single month?

787
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:07,632
Yeah, pension program
sends a check and benefits.

788
00:57:07,716 --> 00:57:09,175
How much is that check for?

789
00:57:09,593 --> 00:57:11,260
Kid, I'm really not in the mood
for this right now.

790
00:57:11,345 --> 00:57:13,304
This Skywayman's driving me crazy.

791
00:57:13,388 --> 00:57:14,597
Who's the Skywayman?

792
00:57:14,681 --> 00:57:17,767
Some nut flying around the country,
posing as a Pan Am pilot.

793
00:57:17,851 --> 00:57:20,686
There's a column about him
in the paper today.

794
00:57:27,111 --> 00:57:30,947
I keep telling them it's not my problem.
This guy doesn't even fly Pan Am.

795
00:57:31,031 --> 00:57:34,075
Flies everybody else.
Flies United, TWA,

796
00:57:34,201 --> 00:57:35,868
Continental, Eastern.

797
00:57:36,203 --> 00:57:37,912
The Skywayman.

798
00:57:38,413 --> 00:57:40,581
Newspaper loves this clown.

799
00:57:41,416 --> 00:57:43,543
They call him the James Bond
of the sky.

800
00:57:46,547 --> 00:57:47,547
Did you say...

801
00:57:47,631 --> 00:57:49,257
Bond, James Bond.

802
00:57:58,934 --> 00:58:01,435
Tell me, Joan,
why does he do it?

803
00:58:01,562 --> 00:58:03,062
He likes to win.

804
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:05,439
We'll be landing in 20 minutes.

805
00:58:05,566 --> 00:58:08,359
Do you want to play it easy,
or the hard way?

806
00:58:08,443 --> 00:58:10,153
And this isn't a tranquilizer.

807
00:58:10,237 --> 00:58:13,281
Pussy, you know a lot more
about planes than guns.

808
00:58:13,991 --> 00:58:15,491
Hello, Pussy.

809
00:58:16,410 --> 00:58:18,369
You're sure this is the suit, right?

810
00:58:18,453 --> 00:58:19,620
Positive.

811
00:58:19,788 --> 00:58:21,831
It's the exact suit he wore in the movie.

812
00:58:21,915 --> 00:58:24,167
Okay. I'll take three.

813
00:58:24,251 --> 00:58:25,960
Certainly, Mr. Fleming.

814
00:58:26,086 --> 00:58:30,298
Now all you need is one of those
little foreign sports cars that he drives.

815
00:58:57,910 --> 00:58:59,452
- Hello.
- Hi.

816
00:59:03,332 --> 00:59:05,249
Haven't I seen you before?

817
00:59:07,794 --> 00:59:09,086
Maybe.

818
00:59:09,630 --> 00:59:12,798
A couple of years ago,
I was on the cover of Seventeen.

819
00:59:15,093 --> 00:59:17,595
You're that model, right? Cheryl.

820
00:59:18,597 --> 00:59:21,474
Guys used to put your picture
on their lockers.

821
00:59:23,268 --> 00:59:26,145
Isn't that your silver car
I saw parked out front?

822
00:59:26,438 --> 00:59:28,648
Yeah. One of them.

823
00:59:32,986 --> 00:59:35,613
So, think I could get an autograph?

824
00:59:39,993 --> 00:59:41,994
Do you have a pen in your room?

825
01:00:16,738 --> 01:00:18,030
Shh.

826
01:00:20,701 --> 01:00:23,536
A man like you can buy
anything he wants.

827
01:00:35,215 --> 01:00:38,384
He buys a deck of cards
at the hotel gift shop.

828
01:00:41,722 --> 01:00:43,556
You want to see a card trick?

829
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:47,184
How much did these cards cost?

830
01:00:49,021 --> 01:00:51,397
I don't know, 55 cents, I think.

831
01:00:54,735 --> 01:00:58,738
And if they sold me downstairs
at the hotel gift shop,

832
01:01:00,741 --> 01:01:02,742
how much would you pay?

833
01:01:05,579 --> 01:01:08,539
I'm sorry, how much would
I pay for what?

834
01:01:11,460 --> 01:01:13,085
The entire night.

835
01:01:15,422 --> 01:01:18,591
How much would you pay me
for the entire night?

836
01:01:23,221 --> 01:01:25,931
Cheryl, I really don't know.

837
01:01:28,101 --> 01:01:29,769
Don't be scared.

838
01:01:34,274 --> 01:01:35,983
Make me an offer.

839
01:01:43,742 --> 01:01:45,117
300?

840
01:01:46,453 --> 01:01:47,953
Go fish.

841
01:01:51,833 --> 01:01:53,459
$500?

842
01:01:54,169 --> 01:01:55,461
Go fish.

843
01:01:56,797 --> 01:01:58,255
600.

844
01:02:00,133 --> 01:02:01,425
Go fish!

845
01:02:04,763 --> 01:02:06,097
$1,000.

846
01:02:08,683 --> 01:02:09,809
Okay.

847
01:02:11,812 --> 01:02:13,646
$1,000.

848
01:02:15,315 --> 01:02:16,649
Okay.

849
01:02:17,484 --> 01:02:19,026
I'll be right back.

850
01:02:19,820 --> 01:02:21,445
Wait a second, where are you going?

851
01:02:21,530 --> 01:02:23,989
I'm going downstairs to cash a check.

852
01:02:25,075 --> 01:02:28,828
You think this hotel is going to cash
a $1,000 check at 3:00 a.m.?

853
01:02:32,165 --> 01:02:35,668
It's a New York Savings and Loan
check. It's like gold. They'll cash it.

854
01:02:36,086 --> 01:02:39,547
Don't you think they might get
a little suspicious? Let me see that.

855
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:44,760
It's a cashier's check.
Endorse it over to me.

856
01:02:44,845 --> 01:02:46,345
I couldn't do that.

857
01:02:46,430 --> 01:02:49,849
This check is for 1,400.
We agreed upon 1,000.

858
01:02:51,309 --> 01:02:54,019
Why don't I give you back 400

859
01:02:54,813 --> 01:02:56,981
and you give me that check?

860
01:02:58,316 --> 01:02:59,692
Even better.

861
01:03:31,725 --> 01:03:33,684
Does this belong to anybody?

862
01:03:50,368 --> 01:03:52,244
This is Hanratty. Merry Christmas.

863
01:03:52,370 --> 01:03:53,746
Hello, Carl.

864
01:03:54,539 --> 01:03:55,664
Hello.

865
01:03:57,918 --> 01:04:00,252
Barry Allen, Secret Service.

866
01:04:01,171 --> 01:04:05,007
I've been trying to track you down now
for the last couple of hours.

867
01:04:05,133 --> 01:04:06,258
What do you want?

868
01:04:07,093 --> 01:04:10,763
I wanted to apologize
for what happened out in Los Angeles.

869
01:04:10,847 --> 01:04:12,014
Uh-uh. Uh-uh.

870
01:04:12,098 --> 01:04:14,266
No, you don't apologize to me.

871
01:04:14,851 --> 01:04:17,228
Do you always work
on Christmas Eve, Carl?

872
01:04:17,604 --> 01:04:19,522
I volunteered

873
01:04:19,773 --> 01:04:21,732
so the men with families
could go home early.

874
01:04:22,609 --> 01:04:24,818
Looked like you were wearing
a wedding ring out in Los Angeles.

875
01:04:24,903 --> 01:04:26,695
I thought maybe you had a family.

876
01:04:27,030 --> 01:04:28,531
No. No family.

877
01:04:30,367 --> 01:04:33,994
You want to talk to me?
Let's talk face to face.

878
01:04:34,287 --> 01:04:35,579
All right.

879
01:04:35,664 --> 01:04:39,333
I'm at my suite
at the Stuyvesant Arms, room 3113.

880
01:04:39,793 --> 01:04:42,920
In the morning, I leave for Las Vegas
for the weekend.

881
01:04:45,215 --> 01:04:47,633
You think you're going to get me again?

882
01:04:48,260 --> 01:04:51,887
You're not going to Vegas,
you're not in the Stuyvesant Arms.

883
01:04:52,806 --> 01:04:57,935
You'd love for me to send out 20 agents,
Christmas Eve, barge into your hotel,

884
01:04:58,228 --> 01:05:00,604
knock down the door
so you can make fools out of us all.

885
01:05:01,314 --> 01:05:04,608
I'm really sorry if I made a fool
out of you. I really am.

886
01:05:04,693 --> 01:05:06,026
Uh-uh. No.

887
01:05:06,111 --> 01:05:09,113
No. You do not feel sorry for me.

888
01:05:09,489 --> 01:05:13,826
The truth is, I knew it was you.
I didn't get the cuffs on you, but I knew.

889
01:05:14,911 --> 01:05:17,830
People only know
what you tell them, Carl.

890
01:05:18,915 --> 01:05:21,959
Then tell me this,
Barry Allen, Secret Service.

891
01:05:22,502 --> 01:05:25,254
How did you know
I wouldn't look in your wallet?

892
01:05:25,338 --> 01:05:28,340
The same reason
the Yankees always win.

893
01:05:28,466 --> 01:05:31,594
Nobody can keep their eyes
off the pinstripes.

894
01:05:31,845 --> 01:05:34,513
The Yankees win
because they have Mickey Mantle.

895
01:05:34,598 --> 01:05:36,849
No one ever bets on the uniform.

896
01:05:37,601 --> 01:05:39,643
You sure about that, Carl?

897
01:05:39,811 --> 01:05:42,021
I'll tell you what I am sure of.

898
01:05:42,147 --> 01:05:44,023
You're going to get caught.

899
01:05:44,691 --> 01:05:48,319
One way or another,
it's a mathematical fact. It's like Vegas.

900
01:05:48,445 --> 01:05:50,195
The house always wins.

901
01:05:55,660 --> 01:05:59,163
Well, Carl, I'm sorry, but I have to go.

902
01:06:00,624 --> 01:06:03,292
You didn't call just to apologize,
did you?

903
01:06:04,544 --> 01:06:05,794
What do you mean?

904
01:06:07,547 --> 01:06:09,590
You have no one else to call.

905
01:06:12,052 --> 01:06:13,218
Whoa!

906
01:06:47,087 --> 01:06:48,629
More coffee, sir?

907
01:06:54,969 --> 01:06:57,763
- Are you a collector?
- Of what?

908
01:06:57,847 --> 01:06:59,181
Captives of the Cosmic Ray,

909
01:06:59,265 --> 01:07:01,225
The Big Freeze,
Land of the Golden Giants.

910
01:07:01,309 --> 01:07:03,936
- I've got them all.
- What are you talking about?

911
01:07:04,688 --> 01:07:05,938
Barry Allen.

912
01:07:09,109 --> 01:07:10,150
The Flash.

913
01:07:12,445 --> 01:07:13,779
Wait, kid.

914
01:07:16,366 --> 01:07:17,991
You mean, like the comic book?

915
01:07:18,076 --> 01:07:21,120
Yeah, the comic book. When he's not
The Flash, that's his name, Barry Allen.

916
01:07:22,956 --> 01:07:24,331
Thank you.

917
01:07:28,253 --> 01:07:31,088
Now get this, he reads comic books!

918
01:07:31,506 --> 01:07:33,882
Comic books! Barry Allen is The Flash!

919
01:07:33,967 --> 01:07:36,218
Carl, slow down. I don't know
what the hell you're talking about.

920
01:07:36,302 --> 01:07:38,220
He's a kid. Our unsub is a kid.

921
01:07:38,304 --> 01:07:41,223
That's why we couldn't match his prints,
that's why he doesn't have a record.

922
01:07:41,307 --> 01:07:43,392
I want you to contact NYPD for every

923
01:07:43,476 --> 01:07:46,270
all-points juvenile runaways
in New York City.

924
01:07:46,354 --> 01:07:49,773
Don't forget the airports. He's been
kiting checks all over the country.

925
01:07:49,858 --> 01:07:51,942
- Why New York?
- The Yankees!

926
01:07:52,026 --> 01:07:54,486
He said something about the Yankees!

927
01:07:57,031 --> 01:07:58,490
Where are we on the list?

928
01:07:58,575 --> 01:08:01,118
Number 53, Abagnale.

929
01:08:04,372 --> 01:08:06,957
Good morning, ma'am,
we're the F.B.I. agents who called.

930
01:08:07,041 --> 01:08:08,167
Yes, I've been waiting.

931
01:08:08,835 --> 01:08:11,837
I hope you're all hungry.
I put out the Sara Lee.

932
01:08:15,258 --> 01:08:17,259
My husband, Jack, is a lawyer.

933
01:08:17,343 --> 01:08:19,970
What about your first husband,
Mrs. Abagnale?

934
01:08:20,054 --> 01:08:23,682
Abagnale. But I prefer
to be called Barnes.

935
01:08:25,685 --> 01:08:28,771
"Frank William Abagnale."
It says he was in the service.

936
01:08:28,855 --> 01:08:30,939
Did you two meet during the war?

937
01:08:31,775 --> 01:08:35,736
Yeah, I lived in a very small village
in France, Montrichard.

938
01:08:36,154 --> 01:08:39,656
The kind of place
where they never heard of Sara Lee.

939
01:08:40,074 --> 01:08:41,617
Help yourselves.

940
01:08:41,701 --> 01:08:43,535
Nobody doesn't like Sara Lee.

941
01:08:43,620 --> 01:08:45,120
You filled out a missing person's report

942
01:08:45,205 --> 01:08:48,665
for a runaway juvenile by the name of
Frank Abagnale, Jr.

943
01:08:49,209 --> 01:08:50,459
Is Frankie okay?

944
01:08:51,419 --> 01:08:52,961
You're aware of the fact that
he wrote some checks

945
01:08:53,046 --> 01:08:55,255
on a closed account
at Chase Manhattan Bank?

946
01:08:55,340 --> 01:08:58,801
Yes. The police think
he's some type of criminal.

947
01:08:58,885 --> 01:09:01,345
What he did was a felony, Mrs. Barnes.

948
01:09:01,888 --> 01:09:03,514
It was $1,000.

949
01:09:04,265 --> 01:09:08,101
Half the kids his age are on dope,
throwing rocks at police.

950
01:09:08,853 --> 01:09:13,065
And they scared me to death
because my son made a little mistake.

951
01:09:14,108 --> 01:09:17,110
A 17-year-old boy has to eat,

952
01:09:17,570 --> 01:09:19,238
has to have a place to sleep.

953
01:09:19,489 --> 01:09:21,365
We understand, ma'am.

954
01:09:22,033 --> 01:09:23,575
Would you happen to have a picture
of your son?

955
01:09:23,868 --> 01:09:25,577
Yes, I have his old yearbook.

956
01:09:35,296 --> 01:09:36,338
Okay.

957
01:09:38,675 --> 01:09:41,343
We need to send out
an all-office teletype.

958
01:09:41,427 --> 01:09:44,930
Our unsub's name
is Frank Abagnale, Jr., age 17!

959
01:09:45,014 --> 01:09:47,266
Is Frankie okay? Is he in trouble?

960
01:09:47,350 --> 01:09:50,227
Ma'am, I'm sorry to have to tell you,
your son is forging checks.

961
01:09:50,311 --> 01:09:53,313
Forging checks? Wait!
I'm sure we can take care of that.

962
01:09:53,398 --> 01:09:55,399
I'm working part-time at the church now.

963
01:09:55,483 --> 01:09:57,985
Just tell me how much he owes
and I'll pay you back.

964
01:09:58,069 --> 01:10:00,404
So far, it's about $1 .3 million.

965
01:10:17,964 --> 01:10:19,548
Hi, Melanie, how are you?

966
01:10:19,632 --> 01:10:22,134
When you're in the house,
please use an ashtray.

967
01:10:22,218 --> 01:10:23,969
Frank, this fondue is so good!

968
01:10:24,053 --> 01:10:26,930
- Great. Take this.
- Good, I love Moët!

969
01:10:35,315 --> 01:10:39,484
James, please! Stay away
from the hi-fi system, all right?

970
01:10:39,569 --> 01:10:42,487
It's a reel-to-reel,
you can't wind it like that.

971
01:10:45,491 --> 01:10:48,577
Christ, Terry! This is Italian knit!

972
01:10:48,661 --> 01:10:51,288
- Watch where you're going!
- It's just a shirt, man!

973
01:10:51,372 --> 01:10:53,373
Frank! Come quick!

974
01:10:54,083 --> 01:10:57,294
Lance just fell into the conversation pit!

975
01:11:02,842 --> 01:11:05,427
Excuse me,
you know where Lance Applebaum is?

976
01:11:05,511 --> 01:11:06,637
Thank you.

977
01:11:07,639 --> 01:11:09,848
These bottles need to be
labeled when you pick them up!

978
01:11:09,933 --> 01:11:12,225
Do you understand
how dangerous this is? Do you?

979
01:11:12,310 --> 01:11:15,562
Don't stand there crying. Nod your head.
Tell me you won't do it again.

980
01:11:15,647 --> 01:11:17,773
Now dry up and get back to work.

981
01:11:24,322 --> 01:11:25,364
You okay?

982
01:11:26,324 --> 01:11:28,825
He told me to pick up the blood, so I did.

983
01:11:28,910 --> 01:11:31,078
But he never told me to label it.

984
01:11:32,455 --> 01:11:34,456
It's okay, stop crying.

985
01:11:34,874 --> 01:11:36,291
What's your name?

986
01:11:37,251 --> 01:11:38,543
Brenda.

987
01:11:41,172 --> 01:11:43,340
Brenda, I wouldn't worry about it.

988
01:11:43,424 --> 01:11:45,842
These doctors don't know everything.

989
01:11:46,594 --> 01:11:48,387
It's my first week.

990
01:11:48,680 --> 01:11:50,514
I think they're going to fire me.

991
01:11:50,598 --> 01:11:53,517
No, nobody's going to fire you, Brenda.

992
01:11:53,893 --> 01:11:55,894
I bet you're good at your job.

993
01:11:57,021 --> 01:11:58,522
No, I'm not.

994
01:11:59,565 --> 01:12:01,984
I bet if I asked you to check
on the status

995
01:12:02,068 --> 01:12:03,777
of my friend Lance Applebaum,

996
01:12:04,612 --> 01:12:07,322
you could do that for me in a second.

997
01:12:14,872 --> 01:12:17,749
Mr. Applebaum fractured his ankle.

998
01:12:17,834 --> 01:12:21,545
Dr. Ashland is treating him
in exam room seven.

999
01:12:21,629 --> 01:12:24,089
You see that? No problem.

1000
01:12:26,259 --> 01:12:28,552
This is the emergency chart.

1001
01:12:29,137 --> 01:12:33,015
See that blue star? That means
the patient has been diagnosed.

1002
01:12:33,099 --> 01:12:37,561
And then after he's been treated,
we put a red circle here. See?

1003
01:12:38,896 --> 01:12:41,189
How do you like those braces?

1004
01:12:42,650 --> 01:12:44,234
I guess they're all right.

1005
01:12:44,944 --> 01:12:47,070
I got mine off last year.

1006
01:12:47,989 --> 01:12:50,615
Boy, I hated them. They were bottoms.

1007
01:12:50,825 --> 01:12:53,035
I still got to wear my mouth guard.

1008
01:12:53,911 --> 01:12:55,746
You have really nice teeth.

1009
01:12:57,540 --> 01:12:59,249
Well, thank you.

1010
01:12:59,625 --> 01:13:01,877
And you have a pretty smile.

1011
01:13:05,381 --> 01:13:09,342
No, I mean it. I really think
those braces look good on you.

1012
01:13:09,552 --> 01:13:10,969
Thank you.

1013
01:13:11,137 --> 01:13:12,471
You're welcome.

1014
01:13:16,184 --> 01:13:17,184
Brenda.

1015
01:13:17,477 --> 01:13:18,685
Yeah.

1016
01:13:18,853 --> 01:13:21,646
Do you know if they're hiring here
at the hospital?

1017
01:13:23,149 --> 01:13:25,859
I'm not sure. What do you want to do?

1018
01:13:27,904 --> 01:13:29,362
I'm a doctor.

1019
01:13:33,159 --> 01:13:34,826
Dear Dad,

1020
01:13:34,911 --> 01:13:37,621
I decided to get off the road for a while.

1021
01:13:37,705 --> 01:13:41,625
I've taken a night job at a hospital
and met some really nice people.

1022
01:13:41,709 --> 01:13:43,418
Feels good to have
my feet on the ground,

1023
01:13:43,503 --> 01:13:45,670
to wake up in the same bed every night.

1024
01:13:47,048 --> 01:13:50,842
Who knows, maybe I'll even find
someone to settle down with.

1025
01:13:53,679 --> 01:13:56,765
"Harvard Medical School."
Top of your class.

1026
01:13:57,850 --> 01:14:00,602
"Southern California
Children's Hospital."

1027
01:14:01,104 --> 01:14:04,439
That is a pretty impressive résumé,
Dr. Conners.

1028
01:14:04,732 --> 01:14:06,399
Unfortunately,

1029
01:14:07,026 --> 01:14:09,111
the only thing I need is.

1030
01:14:14,742 --> 01:14:17,869
Someone to babysit
six interns and 20 nurses.

1031
01:14:18,871 --> 01:14:20,372
But...

1032
01:14:22,041 --> 01:14:25,377
Hell, I doubt that you'd be interested
in that.

1033
01:14:28,214 --> 01:14:31,383
In the past, they've always
let me choose my own nurses.

1034
01:14:32,927 --> 01:14:34,219
Dr. Connelly.

1035
01:14:35,721 --> 01:14:37,305
- Dr. Harris.
- Present.

1036
01:14:38,391 --> 01:14:39,558
Dr. Ashland.

1037
01:14:39,642 --> 01:14:41,059
Dr. Conners?

1038
01:14:41,769 --> 01:14:43,728
You gonna take roll every night?

1039
01:14:43,813 --> 01:14:45,772
Yes, I will, Dr. Ashland.

1040
01:14:45,898 --> 01:14:49,192
And if you're going to be late,
I suggest you bring a note.

1041
01:14:52,738 --> 01:14:54,239
Miss Basmann.

1042
01:14:54,740 --> 01:14:56,158
Miss Mace.

1043
01:14:56,826 --> 01:14:58,326
Miss Strong.

1044
01:14:58,578 --> 01:14:59,661
Here.

1045
01:14:59,745 --> 01:15:01,079
Nurse Brown.

1046
01:15:02,248 --> 01:15:03,582
Nurse Sanford.

1047
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,543
Thirty milligrams
of codeine every four hours.

1048
01:15:06,627 --> 01:15:10,463
Run the plasma at 60 drops a minute
till we calculate the fluid requirements.

1049
01:15:10,590 --> 01:15:14,134
What do you estimate the degree
and extent of the burns, Kildare?

1050
01:15:14,260 --> 01:15:17,429
Second and third-degree burns
over about 20% of the body surface.

1051
01:15:17,513 --> 01:15:21,016
- Do you concur?
- I concur. Let's get him up to Pediatrics.

1052
01:15:27,690 --> 01:15:28,773
Hello, Brenda.

1053
01:15:28,858 --> 01:15:30,275
Hi, Dr. Conners.

1054
01:15:30,943 --> 01:15:33,528
- You need to sign these.
- Thank you.

1055
01:15:40,703 --> 01:15:42,662
Do you notice anything different
about me?

1056
01:15:42,747 --> 01:15:44,915
You got your braces off! Come here.

1057
01:15:44,999 --> 01:15:47,500
I've been trying to show you all night!

1058
01:15:48,836 --> 01:15:49,836
Wow.

1059
01:15:50,213 --> 01:15:51,546
Good job.

1060
01:15:51,631 --> 01:15:54,466
Did it hurt when they took them off?
Mine felt so weird after.

1061
01:15:54,550 --> 01:15:57,469
I keep rubbing my tongue over them.
I can't stop!

1062
01:15:57,678 --> 01:15:59,054
They're so slippery.

1063
01:15:59,138 --> 01:16:02,307
- It feels good, doesn't it?
- Yeah, it feels incredible.

1064
01:16:12,568 --> 01:16:13,902
Oh, my!

1065
01:16:15,238 --> 01:16:16,655
I'm sorry.

1066
01:16:28,501 --> 01:16:31,795
Dr. Conners to the E.R.
Dr. Conners to the E.R.

1067
01:16:31,879 --> 01:16:33,004
Shouldn't you go?

1068
01:16:33,089 --> 01:16:37,717
No. They have a staff doctor
in the emergency ward, we'll be fine.

1069
01:16:44,016 --> 01:16:45,934
What if he's in surgery?

1070
01:16:47,853 --> 01:16:49,437
Do you really think I have to go?

1071
01:16:50,022 --> 01:16:51,773
In here, Dr. Conners.

1072
01:17:08,916 --> 01:17:12,377
Gentlemen, what seems
to be the problem?

1073
01:17:13,087 --> 01:17:17,632
Bicycle accident. A fractured tibia
about five inches below the patella.

1074
01:17:18,217 --> 01:17:19,342
Hmm.

1075
01:17:22,763 --> 01:17:24,222
Dr. Harris.

1076
01:17:24,807 --> 01:17:26,391
Do you concur?

1077
01:17:27,059 --> 01:17:28,977
Concur with what, sir?

1078
01:17:29,645 --> 01:17:32,814
With what Dr. Ashland just said.
Do you concur?

1079
01:17:34,984 --> 01:17:37,902
Well, it was a bicycle accident.
The boy told us.

1080
01:17:38,988 --> 01:17:40,280
So you concur?

1081
01:17:41,949 --> 01:17:45,618
We should take an X-ray, stitch him up
and put him in a walking cast.

1082
01:17:49,415 --> 01:17:51,374
Very good, Dr. Ashland. Very good.

1083
01:17:51,459 --> 01:17:54,419
Well, you don't seem
to have much need for me.

1084
01:17:54,670 --> 01:17:55,754
Carry on.

1085
01:17:58,174 --> 01:17:59,966
I blew it, didn't I?

1086
01:18:01,010 --> 01:18:02,594
Why didn't I concur?

1087
01:18:24,700 --> 01:18:26,326
Make yourself at home!

1088
01:18:27,661 --> 01:18:29,162
Frank Abagnale, Sr.

1089
01:18:29,330 --> 01:18:31,039
You're not a cop.

1090
01:18:32,500 --> 01:18:34,793
Special Agent Hanratty, F.B.I.

1091
01:18:35,336 --> 01:18:38,505
You're not a cop.
My landlord said you were not a cop.

1092
01:18:38,964 --> 01:18:42,592
If you're going to arrest me,
I'd like to put on a different suit.

1093
01:18:42,676 --> 01:18:44,969
- If that's okay...
- I'm not here to arrest you.

1094
01:18:45,054 --> 01:18:47,347
I'm looking for your son. He's in trouble.

1095
01:18:47,473 --> 01:18:49,140
Do you know where he is?

1096
01:18:51,477 --> 01:18:54,938
If I tell you where he is,
will you promise not to tell his mother?

1097
01:18:55,022 --> 01:18:56,106
Sure.

1098
01:18:57,316 --> 01:19:01,403
Frank made up a fake I.D.
and enlisted in the Marine Corps.

1099
01:19:01,487 --> 01:19:03,571
He's over in Vietnam right now.

1100
01:19:03,656 --> 01:19:05,740
That kid is halfway around the world,

1101
01:19:05,825 --> 01:19:09,869
crawling through the damn jungle,
fighting the communists, so...

1102
01:19:11,330 --> 01:19:15,333
Please, don't come to my home
and call my boy a criminal...

1103
01:19:15,584 --> 01:19:19,337
I never said he was a criminal,
Mr. Abagnale. I said he was in trouble.

1104
01:19:20,798 --> 01:19:24,134
If you'd like to give me a call and talk,
here's my number.

1105
01:19:36,564 --> 01:19:38,523
You're not a father, are you?

1106
01:19:40,609 --> 01:19:41,734
Pardon me?

1107
01:19:41,861 --> 01:19:44,154
If you were a father, you'd know.

1108
01:19:44,238 --> 01:19:49,701
I would never give up my son.
I would never give up my son.

1109
01:19:51,704 --> 01:19:53,746
Yes, sir. I understand.

1110
01:19:54,707 --> 01:19:56,541
Sean, now get this.

1111
01:19:57,042 --> 01:20:01,713
"Riverbend Apartments, 415 Landover,
Atlanta, Georgia."

1112
01:20:02,173 --> 01:20:03,840
Atlanta, Georgia.

1113
01:20:03,924 --> 01:20:08,636
I'm on my way to the airport. I'll meet
the team in four hours. Bye-bye!

1114
01:20:10,890 --> 01:20:13,141
Come on, it's okay.

1115
01:20:14,143 --> 01:20:15,727
You don't have to cry.

1116
01:20:16,061 --> 01:20:20,482
I'm sorry! I'm so sorry, Frank!
I can't do this.

1117
01:20:20,566 --> 01:20:22,233
Brenda, listen to me.

1118
01:20:23,235 --> 01:20:25,361
I don't care if you're a virgin, all right?

1119
01:20:25,446 --> 01:20:26,696
Really, I can wait.

1120
01:20:27,907 --> 01:20:29,616
I'm not a virgin.

1121
01:20:34,079 --> 01:20:36,498
I had an abortion two years ago.

1122
01:20:40,085 --> 01:20:42,587
My parents had a friend do it.

1123
01:20:43,088 --> 01:20:46,299
A man that my father plays golf with.

1124
01:20:47,801 --> 01:20:51,012
And when I got better,
they kicked me out of the house.

1125
01:20:51,931 --> 01:20:55,475
I had an abortion
and I wasn't their daughter anymore!

1126
01:20:56,310 --> 01:20:59,270
I'm so sorry. Please don't be mad at me.

1127
01:21:00,940 --> 01:21:02,106
No, no.

1128
01:21:02,274 --> 01:21:04,442
- Please don't be mad at me.
- Shh.

1129
01:21:06,445 --> 01:21:08,947
What if I spoke to your parents?

1130
01:21:09,114 --> 01:21:11,282
Maybe I can straighten things out.

1131
01:21:11,367 --> 01:21:14,953
I ask them all the time,
but they said I still can't come home.

1132
01:21:15,829 --> 01:21:18,957
And my daddy's a lawyer.

1133
01:21:27,341 --> 01:21:28,508
Brenda?

1134
01:21:31,136 --> 01:21:33,846
What if you were engaged to a doctor?

1135
01:21:34,515 --> 01:21:36,391
Would that change anything?

1136
01:21:36,475 --> 01:21:37,725
What?

1137
01:21:41,522 --> 01:21:44,023
What if I went to your parents,

1138
01:21:45,484 --> 01:21:47,819
and I spoke to your father

1139
01:21:51,073 --> 01:21:53,700
and I asked permission to marry you?

1140
01:22:07,423 --> 01:22:09,841
- It's empty.
- Nobody here.

1141
01:22:33,866 --> 01:22:36,200
Dr. Conners, are you Lutheran?

1142
01:22:37,703 --> 01:22:39,454
Yes, I am a Lutheran.

1143
01:22:39,538 --> 01:22:41,706
But please, call me Frank.

1144
01:22:43,042 --> 01:22:45,710
Frank, would you like to say grace?

1145
01:22:51,216 --> 01:22:53,551
Unless you're not comfortable.

1146
01:22:53,886 --> 01:22:55,303
Absolutely.

1147
01:23:05,814 --> 01:23:08,900
Two little mice fell
into a bucket of cream.

1148
01:23:10,736 --> 01:23:12,820
The first mouse
quickly gave up and drowned,

1149
01:23:12,905 --> 01:23:14,739
but the second mouse struggled so hard

1150
01:23:14,823 --> 01:23:17,450
that he eventually churned
that cream into butter,

1151
01:23:18,243 --> 01:23:19,702
and he walked out.

1152
01:23:21,246 --> 01:23:22,246
Amen.

1153
01:23:25,084 --> 01:23:26,918
That was beautiful.

1154
01:23:27,252 --> 01:23:29,587
The mouse churned
that cream into butter.

1155
01:23:32,758 --> 01:23:33,966
That's right.

1156
01:23:35,302 --> 01:23:36,719
Thank you.

1157
01:23:36,804 --> 01:23:39,931
Frank, have you decided which hospital
you want to work at in New Orleans?

1158
01:23:41,934 --> 01:23:45,561
To be quite honest,
I'm thinking about getting back into law.

1159
01:23:46,355 --> 01:23:49,107
Oh, my! Are you a doctor or a lawyer?

1160
01:23:49,942 --> 01:23:53,361
Before I went to medical school,
I passed the bar in California.

1161
01:23:53,445 --> 01:23:56,197
I practiced law for one year,
then I decided,

1162
01:23:56,448 --> 01:23:58,991
why not try my hand at pediatrics?

1163
01:24:00,119 --> 01:24:02,328
You're just full of surprises.

1164
01:24:03,288 --> 01:24:04,497
Yeah.

1165
01:24:05,541 --> 01:24:08,876
A doctor and a lawyer.
Brenda hit the jackpot.

1166
01:24:09,378 --> 01:24:11,337
Where did you go to law school?

1167
01:24:11,797 --> 01:24:13,214
Berkeley.

1168
01:24:15,718 --> 01:24:17,677
Oh, my gosh.
Isn't that where you went, Daddy?

1169
01:24:17,803 --> 01:24:19,429
Maybe Frank could come
work for you, Roger.

1170
01:24:19,513 --> 01:24:22,765
You're always saying how hard it is
to find assistant prosecutors.

1171
01:24:22,850 --> 01:24:25,893
Could he, Daddy? Could he, please?
Could he come work with you, please?

1172
01:24:25,978 --> 01:24:27,562
Was that snake Hollingsworth

1173
01:24:27,646 --> 01:24:30,231
still teaching there
when you went through Berkeley?

1174
01:24:32,067 --> 01:24:33,067
Hollingsworth.

1175
01:24:33,152 --> 01:24:35,486
Yes. Grumpy old Hollingsworth, right?

1176
01:24:35,571 --> 01:24:37,321
Meaner than ever.

1177
01:24:37,823 --> 01:24:39,699
And that dog of his?

1178
01:24:42,536 --> 01:24:46,038
Tell me, Frank,
what was the name of his little dog?

1179
01:24:55,674 --> 01:24:57,091
I'm sorry.

1180
01:24:58,927 --> 01:25:00,470
The dog was dead.

1181
01:25:00,846 --> 01:25:01,846
Oh.

1182
01:25:03,724 --> 01:25:05,349
How unfortunate.

1183
01:25:06,769 --> 01:25:07,852
Yeah.

1184
01:25:38,217 --> 01:25:40,718
A doctor, a lawyer, a Lutheran.

1185
01:25:43,555 --> 01:25:45,640
So, what are you, Frank?

1186
01:25:46,558 --> 01:25:49,936
'Cause I think you're about to ask
for my daughter's hand in marriage,

1187
01:25:50,062 --> 01:25:51,521
and I have a right to know.

1188
01:25:52,105 --> 01:25:53,731
Know what, sir?

1189
01:25:54,316 --> 01:25:55,733
The truth.

1190
01:25:57,903 --> 01:25:59,946
Tell me the truth, Frank.

1191
01:26:01,323 --> 01:26:03,407
What are you doing here?

1192
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:08,079
What is a man like you
doing with Brenda?

1193
01:26:09,665 --> 01:26:13,125
If you want my blessing,
if you want my daughter,

1194
01:26:13,502 --> 01:26:15,670
I'd like to hear it from you now.

1195
01:26:18,423 --> 01:26:20,174
The truth is, sir...

1196
01:26:24,096 --> 01:26:26,264
The truth is that...

1197
01:26:28,767 --> 01:26:31,310
I'm not a doctor, I'm not a lawyer.

1198
01:26:33,939 --> 01:26:35,982
I'm not an airline pilot.

1199
01:26:37,943 --> 01:26:39,777
I'm nothing, really.

1200
01:26:46,994 --> 01:26:50,121
I'm just a kid
who's in love with your daughter.

1201
01:26:52,374 --> 01:26:53,499
No.

1202
01:27:03,010 --> 01:27:04,969
You know what you are?

1203
01:27:05,304 --> 01:27:07,054
You're a romantic.

1204
01:27:07,180 --> 01:27:10,182
Men like us are nothing
without the women we love.

1205
01:27:10,309 --> 01:27:13,895
I must confess,
I'm guilty of the same foolish whimsy.

1206
01:27:13,979 --> 01:27:16,105
I proposed to Carol after five dates

1207
01:27:16,189 --> 01:27:18,983
with two nickels in my pockets
and holes in my shoes

1208
01:27:19,067 --> 01:27:20,985
because I knew she was the one.

1209
01:27:21,987 --> 01:27:23,738
So go ahead, Frank.

1210
01:27:27,659 --> 01:27:29,327
Don't be afraid.

1211
01:27:29,536 --> 01:27:32,496
Ask the question you came here
to ask me.

1212
01:27:37,669 --> 01:27:41,172
What would I have to do to take the bar
here in New Orleans?

1213
01:27:46,094 --> 01:27:48,095
No, the other question.

1214
01:27:53,352 --> 01:27:55,353
Right through that door.

1215
01:27:57,189 --> 01:27:59,231
Good luck, Mr. Conners.

1216
01:27:59,900 --> 01:28:01,108
Thank you.

1217
01:28:09,201 --> 01:28:10,618
Hey, Frank.

1218
01:28:11,078 --> 01:28:13,412
You know what I could never figure out?

1219
01:28:13,538 --> 01:28:16,332
How did you cheat on the bar exam
in Louisiana?

1220
01:28:16,416 --> 01:28:18,042
What's the difference?

1221
01:28:18,126 --> 01:28:22,129
- Someone took the test for you?
- I'm going to prison for a long time.

1222
01:28:22,589 --> 01:28:25,091
Seriously, what's the difference?

1223
01:28:25,467 --> 01:28:27,468
It's a simple question.

1224
01:28:28,553 --> 01:28:31,055
Are you going to eat that éclair?

1225
01:28:32,724 --> 01:28:35,393
Yeah. I'm saving it for later.

1226
01:28:36,436 --> 01:28:38,437
Or you want to split it with me?

1227
01:28:38,563 --> 01:28:39,605
No.

1228
01:28:43,110 --> 01:28:45,736
Give me half that éclair and I'll tell you.

1229
01:28:56,581 --> 01:28:59,166
I'm gonna figure it out sooner or later.

1230
01:29:05,799 --> 01:29:09,343
You'll be working under Phillip Rigby
in corporate law.

1231
01:29:09,678 --> 01:29:12,763
Why don't you settle in,
organize your desk?

1232
01:29:15,434 --> 01:29:17,435
We're having lunch at 12:30

1233
01:29:17,519 --> 01:29:21,897
with the Attorney General
and Governor McKeithen himself.

1234
01:29:22,441 --> 01:29:23,607
A governor!

1235
01:29:23,692 --> 01:29:25,317
Did we spell it right?

1236
01:29:25,444 --> 01:29:26,694
You sure did.

1237
01:29:27,029 --> 01:29:28,529
Congratulations.

1238
01:29:28,613 --> 01:29:30,865
- Thank you, sir.
- Welcome aboard.

1239
01:29:38,206 --> 01:29:40,958
Look at this photograph, Mr. Stewart.

1240
01:29:41,293 --> 01:29:45,296
It's a photograph of Prentice York,
where they found him, dead.

1241
01:29:45,714 --> 01:29:48,632
Here is an enlargement
of part of that photograph.

1242
01:29:49,009 --> 01:29:52,636
This is a photograph of the defendant's
signature on a canceled check.

1243
01:29:52,721 --> 01:29:56,640
Here is an enlargement of that
same signature, which matches

1244
01:29:56,892 --> 01:29:59,894
the signature on the letters
that he wrote to Mrs. Simon,

1245
01:29:59,978 --> 01:30:04,190
which discuss the possibility of
defrauding the great state of Louisiana.

1246
01:30:04,316 --> 01:30:07,151
Your Honor,
ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

1247
01:30:07,235 --> 01:30:11,530
this is irrefutable evidence
that the defendant is, in fact, lying.

1248
01:30:17,496 --> 01:30:21,457
Mr. Conners,
this is a preliminary hearing.

1249
01:30:22,250 --> 01:30:24,835
There is no defendant.

1250
01:30:26,838 --> 01:30:29,715
There is no jury.

1251
01:30:31,510 --> 01:30:32,760
It's just me.

1252
01:30:34,054 --> 01:30:35,262
Son,

1253
01:30:35,514 --> 01:30:38,099
what in the hell is wrong with you?

1254
01:30:39,559 --> 01:30:41,852
Is that Mitch? Roger!

1255
01:30:42,687 --> 01:30:43,938
It's Mitch!

1256
01:30:44,106 --> 01:30:45,940
I lost all track of time.

1257
01:30:46,024 --> 01:30:48,359
As studio guests
for the sing-along tonight,

1258
01:30:48,443 --> 01:30:49,485
we have the children's choir

1259
01:30:49,569 --> 01:30:51,946
of Saint Monica's Church
in New York City.

1260
01:30:52,030 --> 01:30:56,117
Won't you join them and the gang
in a few songs for the lrish? Everybody!

1261
01:32:26,958 --> 01:32:28,083
Dad?

1262
01:32:32,464 --> 01:32:34,215
What are you doing here?

1263
01:32:36,218 --> 01:32:37,968
I came to see you.

1264
01:32:42,140 --> 01:32:44,058
What are you doing dressed like this?

1265
01:32:44,142 --> 01:32:46,101
I took a government job.

1266
01:32:46,228 --> 01:32:49,605
You see what I'm doing?
Do you have a good lawyer?

1267
01:32:50,857 --> 01:32:52,358
I sort of am a lawyer now.

1268
01:32:52,442 --> 01:32:54,985
Look at this letter. The IRS wants more.

1269
01:32:55,946 --> 01:32:58,489
I had a deal with them. Two penalties.

1270
01:32:58,573 --> 01:33:01,242
They ate the cake,
now they want the crumbs.

1271
01:33:01,952 --> 01:33:03,577
I want to sue them.

1272
01:33:04,746 --> 01:33:06,830
Now they want the crumbs.

1273
01:33:08,583 --> 01:33:09,833
Sit down.

1274
01:33:09,918 --> 01:33:13,170
They're trying to scare me,
intimidate me. You know what?

1275
01:33:14,839 --> 01:33:16,215
You know what?

1276
01:33:16,299 --> 01:33:18,342
I'll make them chase me

1277
01:33:18,927 --> 01:33:21,178
for the rest of their lives!

1278
01:33:28,144 --> 01:33:30,229
It's great to see you, Daddy.

1279
01:33:32,065 --> 01:33:34,483
Sit down, I want to show you something.

1280
01:33:36,903 --> 01:33:39,196
I came here to give you this.

1281
01:33:39,281 --> 01:33:42,241
It's an invitation to an engagement party.

1282
01:33:44,995 --> 01:33:47,204
Daddy, I'm getting married.

1283
01:33:47,998 --> 01:33:50,207
Can you believe that
I'm getting married?

1284
01:33:50,292 --> 01:33:53,585
You don't need to worry
about anything now, Dad. Listen.

1285
01:33:53,670 --> 01:33:57,298
I'm getting a brand-new Cadillac,
I'm getting a $60,000 house,

1286
01:33:57,382 --> 01:33:59,091
I'm getting it all back.

1287
01:33:59,217 --> 01:34:03,971
All the jewelry, the furs, everything
they took from us, I'll get it back.

1288
01:34:07,350 --> 01:34:09,310
Has Ma seen you dressed like this?

1289
01:34:10,895 --> 01:34:13,105
Yeah, she came to pick up some boxes.

1290
01:34:13,523 --> 01:34:15,316
That's okay. You know why?

1291
01:34:15,400 --> 01:34:17,735
Because she's going to the wedding
with us.

1292
01:34:17,861 --> 01:34:20,195
I'm gonna get you
a brand-new suit, Dad.

1293
01:34:20,655 --> 01:34:23,157
One of those Manhattan Eagle,
three-button black pearl suits.

1294
01:34:23,241 --> 01:34:24,325
You'll look great.

1295
01:34:24,409 --> 01:34:26,910
Those are nice. She won't see me.

1296
01:34:29,456 --> 01:34:31,665
Have you tried to call her?

1297
01:34:33,460 --> 01:34:38,255
Why don't you call her right now?

1298
01:34:38,548 --> 01:34:40,049
Dad, just call her.

1299
01:34:40,133 --> 01:34:41,675
Call her for me.

1300
01:34:41,926 --> 01:34:45,637
Tell her I have two first-class tickets
to go see her son's wedding...

1301
01:34:45,722 --> 01:34:47,598
You mother's married now
to my friend, Jack Barnes.

1302
01:34:47,682 --> 01:34:50,434
They have a house in Long Island.

1303
01:34:51,603 --> 01:34:54,271
I had an F.B.I. agent come see me.

1304
01:34:55,523 --> 01:34:58,817
You got their number, son.
The guy looked scared.

1305
01:34:59,361 --> 01:35:03,155
The United States Government, champ,
running for the hills.

1306
01:35:04,199 --> 01:35:05,574
Pow! To the moon!

1307
01:35:17,045 --> 01:35:18,045
Dad.

1308
01:35:19,214 --> 01:35:20,631
It's over.

1309
01:35:21,800 --> 01:35:23,175
I'm going to stop now.

1310
01:35:26,346 --> 01:35:28,138
They're never gonna catch you, Frank.

1311
01:35:28,223 --> 01:35:31,683
She wouldn't do that!
Why would she do that to you?

1312
01:35:31,851 --> 01:35:34,770
Come on. Sit with me. Have a drink.
I'm your father.

1313
01:35:36,231 --> 01:35:40,442
Then ask me to stop.
Then ask me to stop.

1314
01:35:43,780 --> 01:35:45,364
You can't stop.

1315
01:35:47,951 --> 01:35:49,952
Where are you going?

1316
01:35:50,036 --> 01:35:52,371
Come on, Frank, where are you going?

1317
01:35:52,497 --> 01:35:55,082
Where are you going?
Where are you going tonight?

1318
01:35:55,417 --> 01:35:56,792
Someplace exotic?

1319
01:35:56,876 --> 01:35:59,503
Where are you going tonight?
Tahiti? Hawaii?

1320
01:36:16,896 --> 01:36:18,605
This is Hanratty.

1321
01:36:19,899 --> 01:36:21,400
Hello, Carl.

1322
01:36:21,985 --> 01:36:23,485
Merry Christmas.

1323
01:36:23,987 --> 01:36:25,863
How are you, Dr. Conners?

1324
01:36:26,364 --> 01:36:29,491
Carl, I haven't been Dr. Conners
for months now.

1325
01:36:32,912 --> 01:36:34,121
Well,

1326
01:36:34,414 --> 01:36:37,166
I'm sitting here in my office
on Christmas Eve.

1327
01:36:38,001 --> 01:36:39,626
What do you want?

1328
01:36:45,133 --> 01:36:46,341
Okay.

1329
01:36:50,889 --> 01:36:52,764
I want it to be over.

1330
01:36:57,395 --> 01:37:00,230
I want it to be over. I'm getting married.

1331
01:37:00,773 --> 01:37:02,399
I'm settling down.

1332
01:37:02,484 --> 01:37:04,735
You've stolen almost $4 million.

1333
01:37:04,986 --> 01:37:07,279
You think we could call it
a wedding present?

1334
01:37:07,363 --> 01:37:09,656
This isn't something
you get to walk away from, Frank.

1335
01:37:09,741 --> 01:37:12,117
- I want to call a truce.
- No truce.

1336
01:37:12,202 --> 01:37:15,829
You will be caught, you will go to prison.
Where did you think this was going?

1337
01:37:16,372 --> 01:37:18,707
Please leave me alone, Carl.

1338
01:37:19,334 --> 01:37:20,584
Please?

1339
01:37:21,169 --> 01:37:23,253
I'm getting close, aren't I?

1340
01:37:23,338 --> 01:37:25,964
You're scared because
I'm getting close. I know

1341
01:37:26,049 --> 01:37:30,260
you rented a car in Shreveport,
stayed in a hotel on Lake Charles.

1342
01:37:31,262 --> 01:37:33,138
You want to run, be my guest.

1343
01:37:33,223 --> 01:37:35,849
Your checks don't lie as well as you do.

1344
01:37:35,934 --> 01:37:37,601
Stop chasing me.

1345
01:37:40,772 --> 01:37:42,272
I can't stop.

1346
01:37:43,608 --> 01:37:44,983
It's my job.

1347
01:37:46,236 --> 01:37:47,945
It's okay, Carl.

1348
01:37:50,114 --> 01:37:52,157
I just thought I'd ask.

1349
01:37:54,494 --> 01:37:55,494
Hey.

1350
01:37:56,746 --> 01:37:58,247
Merry Christmas.

1351
01:38:01,793 --> 01:38:03,377
I love my job.

1352
01:38:04,796 --> 01:38:06,171
All right.

1353
01:38:06,381 --> 01:38:09,800
Let's get every newspaper in Louisiana
for the last two months.

1354
01:38:09,884 --> 01:38:11,343
What're we looking for?

1355
01:38:11,427 --> 01:38:13,971
Engagement announcements.
Name of Conners.

1356
01:38:14,556 --> 01:38:17,558
Come on, the kid
would have changed his name by now.

1357
01:38:17,642 --> 01:38:20,310
Uh-uh. He can't change it.

1358
01:38:20,687 --> 01:38:22,354
She thinks he's Conners.

1359
01:38:22,438 --> 01:38:24,940
If he loses the name, he loses the girl.

1360
01:38:35,159 --> 01:38:37,786
- Congratulations!
- Having a good time?

1361
01:38:42,166 --> 01:38:43,667
Keep dancing.

1362
01:38:46,504 --> 01:38:48,171
Look who's here.

1363
01:38:49,674 --> 01:38:51,967
I'm going to the little boys' room.

1364
01:38:52,552 --> 01:38:53,969
Hurry back.

1365
01:39:09,360 --> 01:39:12,362
Good evening.
I'm Agent Hanratty with the F.B.I.

1366
01:39:12,447 --> 01:39:14,781
We'd like to have a few kind words
with your host, if possible.

1367
01:39:14,866 --> 01:39:16,158
I'll get him.

1368
01:39:18,620 --> 01:39:20,537
Right over there, sir.

1369
01:39:22,790 --> 01:39:24,708
Good evening, gentlemen.
I'm Roger Strong.

1370
01:39:24,792 --> 01:39:28,295
Carl Hanratty, F.B.I.
These are Agents Amdursky and Fox.

1371
01:39:29,339 --> 01:39:32,883
- Sorry to crash your party, sir.
- Not at all. What can I do for you?

1372
01:39:32,967 --> 01:39:36,345
If it's not too much trouble,
I'd like to meet the groom.

1373
01:39:36,429 --> 01:39:38,221
Is there a problem?

1374
01:39:40,808 --> 01:39:43,393
Frank! Can you hold all these?

1375
01:39:43,478 --> 01:39:45,437
They're checks.
They're from my dad's friends.

1376
01:39:45,521 --> 01:39:47,814
They're for us so
we can start our new life...

1377
01:39:47,899 --> 01:39:50,484
What are you doing? What's wrong?

1378
01:39:50,610 --> 01:39:52,361
We have to leave.

1379
01:39:55,198 --> 01:39:56,698
You love me, right?

1380
01:39:56,908 --> 01:39:59,242
I mean, you'd love me no matter what.

1381
01:39:59,410 --> 01:40:03,246
You'd love me whether I was sick
or poor, or if I had a different name.

1382
01:40:03,331 --> 01:40:04,790
Frank, where did you get
all that money?

1383
01:40:04,916 --> 01:40:08,126
Brenda, listen. A name doesn't matter.

1384
01:40:08,211 --> 01:40:09,544
My name is Frank Conners.

1385
01:40:09,629 --> 01:40:12,255
That's who I am with you.
But we all have secrets.

1386
01:40:12,340 --> 01:40:14,549
Sometimes when I travel,
I use the name Frank Taylor.

1387
01:40:14,634 --> 01:40:16,301
That's my secret.

1388
01:40:16,386 --> 01:40:20,263
Frank Taylor, you know.
Frank Black. It doesn't matter.

1389
01:40:20,890 --> 01:40:22,474
Why are you saying all this?

1390
01:40:24,060 --> 01:40:26,561
Brenda, I don't want to lie
to you anymore.

1391
01:40:26,646 --> 01:40:28,980
I'm not a doctor,
I never went to medical school.

1392
01:40:29,065 --> 01:40:32,359
I'm not a lawyer, or a Harvard graduate
or a Lutheran.

1393
01:40:32,443 --> 01:40:36,196
I ran away from home
a year and a half ago when I was 16.

1394
01:40:39,325 --> 01:40:40,325
Frank.

1395
01:40:41,703 --> 01:40:43,620
You're not a Lutheran?

1396
01:40:44,789 --> 01:40:47,624
You see all this money? I have more.

1397
01:40:48,167 --> 01:40:50,001
I have plenty more.

1398
01:40:50,795 --> 01:40:54,464
I have enough money to last us
for the rest of our lives. Look.

1399
01:40:55,383 --> 01:40:57,300
Frank, stop teasing me!

1400
01:40:57,677 --> 01:41:01,096
You're Frank Conners
and you're 28 years old...

1401
01:41:03,307 --> 01:41:05,142
Why would you lie to me?

1402
01:41:05,351 --> 01:41:06,351
Brenda.

1403
01:41:06,602 --> 01:41:09,396
I want to know your name.
Tell me your name.

1404
01:41:09,480 --> 01:41:12,858
We can live anywhere we want.
But you have to trust me.

1405
01:41:12,942 --> 01:41:15,777
Do you trust me?
Do you love me, Brenda?

1406
01:41:15,862 --> 01:41:17,320
Yes. I love you.

1407
01:41:18,030 --> 01:41:19,614
Excuse me, Mother.

1408
01:41:20,241 --> 01:41:22,951
This is Mr. Hanratty. My wife, Carol.

1409
01:41:23,035 --> 01:41:24,995
- Mister...
- Hanratty, ma'am.

1410
01:41:25,288 --> 01:41:27,122
Have you seen Frank or Brenda?

1411
01:41:27,206 --> 01:41:29,166
I think they went upstairs.

1412
01:41:38,885 --> 01:41:40,051
Come here.

1413
01:41:40,720 --> 01:41:44,347
In two days,
meet me at Miami International Airport.

1414
01:41:44,432 --> 01:41:48,101
Leave the house after your parents
go to sleep. Take a taxicab.

1415
01:41:48,186 --> 01:41:51,813
Give the taxi driver this money.
Tell him to drive all through the night.

1416
01:41:51,898 --> 01:41:53,774
You're gonna leave at 10:00 a.m.

1417
01:41:53,858 --> 01:41:55,317
10:00 a.m. All right?

1418
01:42:15,004 --> 01:42:17,214
- Which room, sir?
- In the corner.

1419
01:42:17,715 --> 01:42:21,885
You have to listen. The International
Terminal in Miami. Say it.

1420
01:42:22,011 --> 01:42:26,139
No matter what, take a taxicab,
be there at 10:00 a.m.

1421
01:42:26,224 --> 01:42:28,016
I'll be there at 10:00 a.m.
no matter what.

1422
01:42:28,100 --> 01:42:30,644
In two days. Two days, Brenda.
Two days.

1423
01:42:30,728 --> 01:42:33,605
In two days I'll be there,
no matter what, at 10:00 a.m.

1424
01:42:40,655 --> 01:42:43,490
We're not gonna tell anyone, Brenda.
You have to promise me now.

1425
01:42:43,574 --> 01:42:48,703
Please! Before you go,
please tell me your name. Tell me.

1426
01:42:50,164 --> 01:42:53,792
Frank William Abagnale, Jr.

1427
01:45:06,592 --> 01:45:07,842
Brenda.

1428
01:45:20,856 --> 01:45:22,899
- This guy is a no-show.
- Maybe he was tipped.

1429
01:45:23,192 --> 01:45:24,734
He's not here today, it'll be tomorrow.

1430
01:45:24,819 --> 01:45:26,486
We'll get him before
he leaves the country.

1431
01:45:26,570 --> 01:45:28,363
He doesn't have a passport.

1432
01:45:28,447 --> 01:45:30,490
For the last six months,
he's gone to Harvard and Berkeley.

1433
01:45:30,574 --> 01:45:32,617
I'm betting he can get a passport.

1434
01:45:32,702 --> 01:45:35,036
Our men are waiting for him here
in Miami International.

1435
01:45:35,121 --> 01:45:36,746
He's used it before,
he knows the layout.

1436
01:45:36,831 --> 01:45:40,291
The Miami police offered us
50 uniformed cops in two shifts of 25.

1437
01:45:40,376 --> 01:45:42,752
With our guys,
that's almost 100 men in one airport.

1438
01:45:42,837 --> 01:45:44,295
Don't you think we should
spread it around?

1439
01:45:44,380 --> 01:45:45,880
No, this is the exit point.

1440
01:45:45,965 --> 01:45:47,507
How do you know he hasn't rented a car

1441
01:45:47,591 --> 01:45:49,968
and driven to airports
in New York, Atlanta?

1442
01:45:50,052 --> 01:45:53,096
Because I'm not in New York.
I'm not in Atlanta.

1443
01:45:53,389 --> 01:45:55,682
Yes. This is Frank Roberts.

1444
01:45:55,766 --> 01:45:58,268
I'm letting all the universities
in the area know

1445
01:45:58,352 --> 01:46:02,105
that Pan Am will be initiating
a new recruiting program this year.

1446
01:46:02,189 --> 01:46:05,442
I'll be stopping by
your campus tomorrow morning.

1447
01:46:05,943 --> 01:46:08,153
Thank you all very much for coming.

1448
01:46:08,654 --> 01:46:12,073
At the end of the day,
I'll be choosing eight young ladies

1449
01:46:12,158 --> 01:46:13,575
to be a part of.

1450
01:46:14,326 --> 01:46:18,163
Pan Am's future stewardess
flight crew program.

1451
01:46:18,247 --> 01:46:20,373
These eight young ladies
will accompany me on

1452
01:46:20,458 --> 01:46:23,334
a two-month public relations tour
through Europe

1453
01:46:24,420 --> 01:46:27,130
where they will discover firsthand
what it takes

1454
01:46:27,214 --> 01:46:29,257
to be a Pan American stewardess.

1455
01:46:32,344 --> 01:46:36,389
Give me at least two men, no,
one man per every two counters.

1456
01:46:38,642 --> 01:46:39,684
Amdursky?

1457
01:46:41,312 --> 01:46:45,398
Make sure your uniforms are covering
the sidewalks, entrances and exits.

1458
01:46:47,568 --> 01:46:50,403
Let's have periodic sweeps
of the men's lav.

1459
01:46:52,114 --> 01:46:55,116
What qualifies me
to be a future stewardess?

1460
01:46:55,367 --> 01:47:00,121
Well, I think that I'm really friendly
and I can really help out

1461
01:47:00,206 --> 01:47:03,208
and make people feel welcome
on the plane and...

1462
01:47:03,292 --> 01:47:05,502
We'll be traveling
at 6,000 miles per hour,

1463
01:47:05,586 --> 01:47:07,545
at an altitude of 300 feet.

1464
01:47:07,671 --> 01:47:09,964
All my bags are packed

1465
01:47:10,800 --> 01:47:12,383
I'm ready to go

1466
01:47:14,762 --> 01:47:16,346
llene Anderson.

1467
01:47:24,563 --> 01:47:26,022
Miggy Acker.

1468
01:47:30,820 --> 01:47:32,570
Debra Jo McMillan.

1469
01:47:39,620 --> 01:47:41,037
Candy Heston.

1470
01:48:40,556 --> 01:48:43,641
- Did you see that blonde out front?
- I should have been a pilot.

1471
01:48:43,726 --> 01:48:44,726
Exactly.

1472
01:48:44,810 --> 01:48:47,687
Mr. Hanratty,
pick up the courtesy telephone.

1473
01:48:47,771 --> 01:48:48,813
Hanratty.

1474
01:48:48,898 --> 01:48:50,190
Your walkie-talkie
wasn't working.

1475
01:48:50,274 --> 01:48:51,941
There's a guy in a Pan Am uniform

1476
01:48:52,026 --> 01:48:54,861
sitting in a white Coupe DeVille
in front of Terminal J.

1477
01:48:54,945 --> 01:48:58,156
That's the charter terminal.
Did you get a look at his face?

1478
01:48:58,240 --> 01:49:01,367
He's got his pilot's cap on.
Carl, I think it's him.

1479
01:49:13,547 --> 01:49:15,173
Out of the car, Frank.

1480
01:49:15,799 --> 01:49:17,008
Frank?

1481
01:49:17,218 --> 01:49:19,052
Step out of the car.

1482
01:49:19,303 --> 01:49:21,262
Keep your hands where I can see them.

1483
01:49:21,347 --> 01:49:23,223
Don't shoot me. I'm just a driver.

1484
01:49:23,307 --> 01:49:25,141
A man paid me $100
to wear this uniform

1485
01:49:25,226 --> 01:49:28,436
- to pick someone up at the airport.
- Who're you picking up?

1486
01:49:28,520 --> 01:49:29,646
Hey!

1487
01:49:54,296 --> 01:49:57,298
South America, Australia,
Singapore, Egypt.

1488
01:49:57,383 --> 01:49:59,509
The kid's gone completely
out of control.

1489
01:49:59,593 --> 01:50:01,928
- Why wasn't I called?
- Nobody was called, sir.

1490
01:50:02,012 --> 01:50:03,805
The banks didn't know
what was happening until last week.

1491
01:50:03,889 --> 01:50:04,931
That's impossible.

1492
01:50:05,015 --> 01:50:07,267
They didn't call because it's not
counterfeiting. It's something else.

1493
01:50:07,351 --> 01:50:09,978
- What is he doing?
- He's making real checks, sir.

1494
01:50:10,062 --> 01:50:11,938
These are so perfect,
the airline didn't know the difference.

1495
01:50:12,022 --> 01:50:13,898
Last check was cashed in Madrid
a week ago.

1496
01:50:13,983 --> 01:50:16,776
My guess is he's still there.
We've to leave now, sir. Today.

1497
01:50:16,860 --> 01:50:19,529
For where? Spain?
You want to go to Spain?

1498
01:50:19,613 --> 01:50:21,906
Eventually, he's gotta go back
to where the checks were printed.

1499
01:50:21,991 --> 01:50:23,366
I think that's why he's moving back
through Europe.

1500
01:50:23,450 --> 01:50:24,867
Look at the map, sir.
He's making a circle.

1501
01:50:24,952 --> 01:50:26,661
He's running out of checks.

1502
01:50:26,745 --> 01:50:31,207
It's a long shot, but if we could track him
from Madrid, we could still catch him.

1503
01:50:31,292 --> 01:50:34,294
I'm sorry, Carl. If you couldn't catch him
here, you're not gonna catch him there.

1504
01:50:34,378 --> 01:50:36,212
We're going to let him get away.

1505
01:50:37,381 --> 01:50:39,757
No, Carl, you let him get away.

1506
01:51:21,633 --> 01:51:24,260
A perfect one-sixteenth

1507
01:51:24,636 --> 01:51:26,429
all the way around.

1508
01:51:28,724 --> 01:51:31,017
Color separation is flawless.

1509
01:51:33,771 --> 01:51:35,313
There's no bleeding.

1510
01:51:35,439 --> 01:51:38,149
Nobody does work like this
in the States.

1511
01:51:38,233 --> 01:51:39,692
Nobody but us.

1512
01:51:39,777 --> 01:51:41,486
Where was it printed?

1513
01:51:41,570 --> 01:51:44,364
- It was printed on a monster.
- A monster.

1514
01:51:44,448 --> 01:51:46,824
- A Heidelberg, an Istra.
- Heidelberg.

1515
01:51:46,909 --> 01:51:50,244
A dinosaur, four colors,
you can smell the weight.

1516
01:51:50,496 --> 01:51:52,663
Two tons, without the ink.

1517
01:51:53,207 --> 01:51:55,625
Where do they do printing like this?

1518
01:51:55,709 --> 01:51:57,335
Germany, Great Britain.

1519
01:51:57,419 --> 01:51:58,669
France.

1520
01:52:01,090 --> 01:52:03,508
France. Frank's mother said the name
of a village in France,

1521
01:52:03,592 --> 01:52:04,884
where they didn't have Sara Lee.

1522
01:52:04,968 --> 01:52:06,677
The village where
she met Frank's father.

1523
01:52:06,762 --> 01:52:07,887
I don't remember.

1524
01:52:07,971 --> 01:52:11,808
It started with an "M."
It was "Mont" something. Mr. Fox?

1525
01:52:11,892 --> 01:52:14,352
Yes. Question,
"You met your husband during the war?"

1526
01:52:14,436 --> 01:52:16,437
Answer, "I lived in a very small village
in France",

1527
01:52:16,522 --> 01:52:17,980
"the kind of place
where they never heard of Sara Lee."

1528
01:52:18,065 --> 01:52:21,025
Tell me you wrote down
the name of the village, Mr. Fox.

1529
01:52:22,611 --> 01:52:24,028
Montrichard.

1530
01:53:20,878 --> 01:53:22,044
Carl?

1531
01:53:24,715 --> 01:53:26,382
Merry Christmas!

1532
01:53:26,508 --> 01:53:29,469
How is it that we're always talking
on Christmas?

1533
01:53:29,553 --> 01:53:31,762
Every Christmas, I'm talking to you!

1534
01:53:31,847 --> 01:53:34,432
Put your shirt on, Frank.
You're under arrest.

1535
01:53:34,516 --> 01:53:36,642
Are you hungry?
Do you want some beans?

1536
01:53:36,727 --> 01:53:38,644
Carl, they got
the best French beans here.

1537
01:53:38,729 --> 01:53:42,482
There's two dozen
French police officers outside.

1538
01:53:42,566 --> 01:53:43,983
They wanted to bring you in,

1539
01:53:44,067 --> 01:53:46,402
but they needed the help
of an American.

1540
01:53:46,487 --> 01:53:47,987
But I told them
I wouldn't bring them to you,

1541
01:53:48,071 --> 01:53:50,072
unless I could put the cuffs
on you myself.

1542
01:53:50,199 --> 01:53:52,825
You have a gun? Do you have a gun?
No gun?

1543
01:53:52,910 --> 01:53:53,910
- No.
- No gun.

1544
01:53:55,871 --> 01:53:58,039
And you're telling me what?

1545
01:53:59,249 --> 01:54:01,209
There's two dozen
French police officers

1546
01:54:01,293 --> 01:54:02,793
out there right now on Christmas Eve?

1547
01:54:02,878 --> 01:54:05,087
- That's what you're telling me?
- Yeah.

1548
01:54:05,172 --> 01:54:07,757
All right. There's no windows here.

1549
01:54:08,342 --> 01:54:09,842
I'm going to take a look
out the front door.

1550
01:54:09,927 --> 01:54:10,927
No!

1551
01:54:11,011 --> 01:54:15,014
I told them I'd walk out first
and give a signal. Put these on yourself.

1552
01:54:15,098 --> 01:54:17,767
No, I can't do that! You know why?

1553
01:54:19,269 --> 01:54:20,853
Because I think you're full of shit.

1554
01:54:20,938 --> 01:54:23,523
I don't think there's anyone else
out there.

1555
01:54:23,607 --> 01:54:26,442
I think it's just me and you. That's right.

1556
01:54:26,527 --> 01:54:28,319
It's just me and you,
and you know what?

1557
01:54:28,987 --> 01:54:30,947
You're gonna have to catch me yourself.

1558
01:54:31,031 --> 01:54:33,991
- We don't have time for this.
- That's good.

1559
01:54:34,910 --> 01:54:37,328
Tell me what you want me to see.

1560
01:54:37,871 --> 01:54:41,541
- I wouldn't lie to you.
- You're wearing a wedding ring.

1561
01:54:41,625 --> 01:54:44,252
You lied to me about that!
Did you lie about that?

1562
01:54:44,336 --> 01:54:48,172
You asked me if I had a family.
I did. But I don't anymore.

1563
01:54:56,848 --> 01:55:00,768
Yes. No, there is no problem.
We're coming out right now.

1564
01:55:03,188 --> 01:55:04,730
That was good.

1565
01:55:05,274 --> 01:55:07,400
Did you pay some hotel desk clerk
to make that call for you?

1566
01:55:07,484 --> 01:55:08,526
Is that what you did?

1567
01:55:08,610 --> 01:55:11,779
It was Captain Luc.
I've got one minute to bring you out.

1568
01:55:11,863 --> 01:55:14,282
Captain Luc? Oh, Captain Luc! Well,

1569
01:55:14,366 --> 01:55:18,244
that sounds pretty official to me,
but, like I said,

1570
01:55:18,328 --> 01:55:22,290
I think it's just me and you here.
So you'll have to catch me.

1571
01:55:22,374 --> 01:55:24,875
Frank, you have to trust me on this.

1572
01:55:24,960 --> 01:55:28,087
These people have been embarrassed.
They're angry.

1573
01:55:28,171 --> 01:55:30,631
You rob their banks, you steal
their money, you live in their country.

1574
01:55:30,716 --> 01:55:32,967
I told you this was
what was going to happen.

1575
01:55:33,051 --> 01:55:34,760
That there was no other way
for it to end.

1576
01:55:36,054 --> 01:55:37,930
Don't make a mistake.

1577
01:55:38,140 --> 01:55:40,391
That's good, Carl, you know?

1578
01:55:41,018 --> 01:55:43,769
Keep pushing that lie. Keep pushing it.

1579
01:55:43,854 --> 01:55:47,481
- Keep pushing till you make it true.
- They'll kill you.

1580
01:55:47,816 --> 01:55:50,026
You walk out that door,
they're gonna kill you.

1581
01:55:55,282 --> 01:55:57,033
Is that the truth?

1582
01:56:01,079 --> 01:56:02,246
Yeah.

1583
01:56:08,003 --> 01:56:09,545
Do you have any children, Carl?

1584
01:56:10,964 --> 01:56:13,382
I have a 4-year-old daughter.

1585
01:56:14,217 --> 01:56:16,552
Do you swear on your daughter?

1586
01:56:18,722 --> 01:56:20,722
You swear?

1587
01:56:58,804 --> 01:57:00,971
That was really good, Carl.

1588
01:57:08,689 --> 01:57:10,022
I have him in custody.

1589
01:57:11,483 --> 01:57:13,609
I got him! It's all right.

1590
01:57:15,612 --> 01:57:17,488
It's all right. I got him.

1591
01:57:21,201 --> 01:57:23,244
I want it on the record.

1592
01:57:23,870 --> 01:57:27,581
Frank Abagnale surrendered
of his own accord. Understood?

1593
01:57:28,750 --> 01:57:31,419
Where are you taking him?
I'm supposed to go.

1594
01:57:33,338 --> 01:57:35,923
Let me in the car!

1595
01:57:41,680 --> 01:57:45,433
Don't worry. I'll have you extradited back
to the United States.

1596
01:58:06,747 --> 01:58:07,830
Carl.

1597
01:58:11,501 --> 01:58:15,254
You have to remember
to let me call my father when we land.

1598
01:58:15,338 --> 01:58:20,092
I want to talk to him before he sees me
on television or something like that.

1599
01:58:30,395 --> 01:58:31,812
Carl, look.

1600
01:58:32,147 --> 01:58:34,148
That's LaGuardia right there.

1601
01:58:34,232 --> 01:58:35,608
Runway 44.

1602
01:58:35,734 --> 01:58:37,902
Frank, your father is dead.

1603
01:58:38,737 --> 01:58:40,112
I'm sorry.

1604
01:58:41,031 --> 01:58:44,825
I didn't want to say anything
until we got closer to home.

1605
01:58:45,660 --> 01:58:46,952
He fell down some steps

1606
01:58:47,037 --> 01:58:50,289
at Grand Central Station
trying to catch a train.

1607
01:58:50,832 --> 01:58:52,875
I didn't want to be the one to tell you.

1608
01:58:53,877 --> 01:58:55,711
You're lying, right?

1609
01:58:57,506 --> 01:58:59,799
You said I could talk to him.

1610
01:58:59,925 --> 01:59:02,718
Who are you to say something like that?

1611
01:59:03,637 --> 01:59:05,888
- You said I could talk to him.
- He fell

1612
01:59:05,972 --> 01:59:08,474
and he broke his neck. I'm sorry.

1613
01:59:09,643 --> 01:59:11,352
I'm really sorry.

1614
01:59:22,405 --> 01:59:23,823
God damn it!

1615
01:59:25,826 --> 01:59:27,701
I'm going to be sick.

1616
01:59:28,119 --> 01:59:29,954
It's all right. It's okay.

1617
01:59:30,038 --> 01:59:33,666
- I'm going to be sick!
- Sure. Let's go to the bathroom.

1618
01:59:40,590 --> 01:59:42,007
God damn it!

1619
02:00:01,736 --> 02:00:02,945
Daddy.

1620
02:00:05,574 --> 02:00:06,824
You'll have to take your seat, sir.

1621
02:00:06,908 --> 02:00:09,493
I've told you twice.
We're landing. All of you.

1622
02:00:09,578 --> 02:00:11,370
Frank! Come on now.

1623
02:00:11,621 --> 02:00:14,498
We're landing in six minutes.
You need to be in your seats...

1624
02:00:14,583 --> 02:00:17,001
- Open the door!
- ...with seat belts fastened.

1625
02:00:17,335 --> 02:00:18,627
Frank!

1626
02:00:20,255 --> 02:00:21,589
You do it.

1627
02:00:51,161 --> 02:00:52,369
Frank!

1628
02:00:58,335 --> 02:01:01,295
All right,
remain seated everyone, please.

1629
02:01:10,430 --> 02:01:12,348
Please remain seated.

1630
02:01:15,268 --> 02:01:16,769
God Almighty.

1631
02:02:06,486 --> 02:02:08,195
What's your name?

1632
02:02:12,200 --> 02:02:13,575
Where's your mommy?

1633
02:02:38,893 --> 02:02:40,644
Sarge, we're good.

1634
02:02:50,739 --> 02:02:51,822
Hold up!

1635
02:02:55,452 --> 02:02:57,828
Put your hands behind your head!

1636
02:02:57,912 --> 02:02:59,079
Carl.

1637
02:02:59,289 --> 02:03:01,415
Get me in the car, please.

1638
02:03:04,127 --> 02:03:05,544
Put him in.

1639
02:03:22,479 --> 02:03:25,814
Taking into account
the gravity of these crimes,

1640
02:03:25,982 --> 02:03:29,068
your history of bold
and elusive behavior

1641
02:03:29,402 --> 02:03:33,322
and your complete lack of respect
for the laws of the United States,

1642
02:03:33,907 --> 02:03:38,327
I have no choice but to ignore
your request to be treated as a minor,

1643
02:03:38,870 --> 02:03:43,499
and sentence you to 12 years
in Atlanta's maximum security prison

1644
02:03:44,125 --> 02:03:47,753
and recommend strongly
that you be kept in isolation

1645
02:03:47,921 --> 02:03:50,464
for the entirety of that sentence.

1646
02:04:32,549 --> 02:04:34,174
Merry Christmas, Frank.

1647
02:04:37,220 --> 02:04:39,388
I got you some comic books.

1648
02:04:46,312 --> 02:04:48,730
How's your daughter?
What was her name?

1649
02:04:49,107 --> 02:04:50,315
Grace.

1650
02:04:52,026 --> 02:04:55,154
I don't know. She lives with her mother
in Chicago, I don't get to see her much.

1651
02:04:57,240 --> 02:04:59,283
What's in the briefcase?

1652
02:05:00,285 --> 02:05:02,578
I'm on my way to the airport.

1653
02:05:02,871 --> 02:05:04,997
It's a paperhanger
working his way through Minnesota.

1654
02:05:07,125 --> 02:05:09,418
Jesus. He's driving us crazy.

1655
02:05:09,711 --> 02:05:11,170
You got any of the checks?

1656
02:05:11,504 --> 02:05:14,131
Yeah, I got a counterfeit he drew

1657
02:05:14,424 --> 02:05:16,675
in Great Lakes Savings and Loan.

1658
02:05:16,759 --> 02:05:19,803
He's using a stencil machine
and an Underwood.

1659
02:05:20,263 --> 02:05:21,847
It's a teller at the bank.

1660
02:05:22,265 --> 02:05:23,557
Say again?

1661
02:05:23,641 --> 02:05:25,350
It's definitely a teller, Carl.

1662
02:05:25,435 --> 02:05:28,353
Banks always use hand stamps
for the dates.

1663
02:05:28,438 --> 02:05:31,607
They get used over and over again,
so they always get worn out.

1664
02:05:31,691 --> 02:05:35,235
And the numbers are always cracking.
The sixes and the nines,

1665
02:05:35,320 --> 02:05:37,112
see, they go first.

1666
02:05:39,532 --> 02:05:40,782
Thanks.

1667
02:05:46,873 --> 02:05:49,708
I'd like you to take a look
at something for me.

1668
02:05:53,963 --> 02:05:55,964
Tell me what you think.

1669
02:05:59,469 --> 02:06:01,011
That's a fake.

1670
02:06:01,137 --> 02:06:02,471
How do you know,
you haven't looked at it?

1671
02:06:02,555 --> 02:06:04,681
There's no perforated edge, right?

1672
02:06:04,807 --> 02:06:07,726
I mean, this check was hand-cut,
not fed.

1673
02:06:09,062 --> 02:06:10,270
Yeah.

1674
02:06:10,355 --> 02:06:14,149
Paper is double-bonded,
much too heavy to be a bank check.

1675
02:06:15,318 --> 02:06:19,279
Magnetic ink, it's raised against
my fingers instead of flat.

1676
02:06:21,032 --> 02:06:25,327
And this doesn't smell like MICR,
it's some kind of a drafting ink.

1677
02:06:25,411 --> 02:06:28,205
The kind you get at a stationery store.

1678
02:06:33,503 --> 02:06:34,753
Frank,

1679
02:06:35,505 --> 02:06:40,092
would you be interested in working
with the F.B.I.'s Financial Crimes Unit?

1680
02:06:40,426 --> 02:06:43,845
I already got a job here, you know.
I deliver the mail.

1681
02:06:46,391 --> 02:06:49,810
Frank, we have the power
to take you out of prison.

1682
02:06:50,979 --> 02:06:53,438
You'll be placed in the custody
of the F.B.I. where you'd serve out

1683
02:06:53,523 --> 02:06:54,606
the remainder of your sentence

1684
02:06:54,691 --> 02:06:56,233
as an employee
of the Federal Government.

1685
02:06:59,195 --> 02:07:01,029
Under whose custody?

1686
02:07:09,872 --> 02:07:11,081
Hi.

1687
02:07:11,207 --> 02:07:14,876
I'm Frank Abagnale.
I'm supposed to start work here today.

1688
02:07:14,961 --> 02:07:18,088
It's a tour company
operating out of the BVI.

1689
02:07:18,298 --> 02:07:19,965
Sir, Mr. Abagnale is here.

1690
02:07:20,049 --> 02:07:22,092
I'm gonna call you back.

1691
02:07:52,081 --> 02:07:54,791
- Hello, Carl.
- Welcome to the F.B.I.

1692
02:07:55,418 --> 02:07:57,961
I'll show you where you're working.

1693
02:08:06,929 --> 02:08:09,348
How long do I have to work here?

1694
02:08:09,474 --> 02:08:12,059
It's 8:15 in the morning
to 5:00 in the afternoon,

1695
02:08:12,143 --> 02:08:14,102
45 minutes for lunch.

1696
02:08:15,938 --> 02:08:17,689
No. I mean, how long?

1697
02:08:19,359 --> 02:08:20,776
Every day.

1698
02:08:21,277 --> 02:08:23,528
Every day, Frank, till we let you go.

1699
02:09:17,417 --> 02:09:18,750
Hey, Carl.

1700
02:09:21,337 --> 02:09:22,587
How are you doing?

1701
02:09:22,672 --> 02:09:26,508
It's not a good time, Frank.
I'm clearing my desk for the weekend.

1702
02:09:29,512 --> 02:09:32,222
You mind
if I come to work with you tomorrow?

1703
02:09:32,348 --> 02:09:34,182
Tomorrow is Saturday.

1704
02:09:34,267 --> 02:09:36,143
I'm flying to Chicago
to see my daughter.

1705
02:09:36,227 --> 02:09:37,561
I'll be back to work on Monday.

1706
02:09:37,687 --> 02:09:41,064
- You're going to see Grace?
- Yeah, that's the plan.

1707
02:09:44,735 --> 02:09:46,778
What should I do till Monday?

1708
02:09:46,863 --> 02:09:50,198
I'm sorry, kid, I can't help you there.
Excuse me.

1709
02:09:56,539 --> 02:09:58,248
This is Hanratty.

1710
02:09:58,958 --> 02:10:00,709
Yeah, put him on.

1711
02:10:08,885 --> 02:10:10,260
Mr. Sawyer.

1712
02:10:10,970 --> 02:10:12,429
How are you?

1713
02:10:12,722 --> 02:10:16,600
I have half a dozen more checks
on that tour operator at the BVI.

1714
02:10:56,933 --> 02:10:58,934
How did you do it, Frank?

1715
02:11:00,770 --> 02:11:03,438
How did you pass the bar in Louisiana?

1716
02:11:03,523 --> 02:11:05,607
What are you doing here?

1717
02:11:06,275 --> 02:11:07,484
Listen.

1718
02:11:08,194 --> 02:11:10,111
I'm sorry I put you through all this.

1719
02:11:10,196 --> 02:11:12,989
You go back to Europe,
you'll die in Perpignan Prison.

1720
02:11:13,074 --> 02:11:14,032
You try to run here in the States,

1721
02:11:14,116 --> 02:11:17,452
we'll send you back to Atlanta
for 50 years.

1722
02:11:17,537 --> 02:11:18,995
I know that.

1723
02:11:20,665 --> 02:11:23,166
I spent four years
trying to arrange your release.

1724
02:11:23,292 --> 02:11:25,085
I had to convince my bosses
at the F.B.I.

1725
02:11:25,169 --> 02:11:28,046
and the Attorney General
of the United States you wouldn't run.

1726
02:11:28,548 --> 02:11:30,298
Why did you do it?

1727
02:11:31,008 --> 02:11:33,718
- You're just a kid.
- I'm not your kid.

1728
02:11:34,136 --> 02:11:36,513
You said you were going to Chicago.

1729
02:11:36,681 --> 02:11:40,475
My daughter can't see me this weekend.
She's going skiing.

1730
02:11:41,018 --> 02:11:43,311
You said she was four years old.
You're lying.

1731
02:11:43,396 --> 02:11:46,189
She was four when I left. Now she's 15.

1732
02:11:46,691 --> 02:11:49,568
My wife has been remarried
for 11 years.

1733
02:11:49,652 --> 02:11:52,070
I see Grace every now and again.

1734
02:11:52,822 --> 02:11:55,323
- I don't understand.
- Sure you do.

1735
02:11:56,158 --> 02:11:58,868
Sometimes it's easier living the lie.

1736
02:12:02,164 --> 02:12:04,499
I'm gonna let you fly tonight, Frank.

1737
02:12:05,334 --> 02:12:09,504
I won't even try to stop you, because
I know you'll be back on Monday.

1738
02:12:09,589 --> 02:12:10,755
Yeah.

1739
02:12:11,257 --> 02:12:13,675
How do you know I'll come back?

1740
02:12:16,053 --> 02:12:17,178
Look.

1741
02:12:18,222 --> 02:12:19,389
Frank.

1742
02:12:19,724 --> 02:12:21,683
Nobody is chasing you.

1743
02:12:42,121 --> 02:12:44,539
Alice, has he still not called?

1744
02:12:44,624 --> 02:12:46,207
No, he hasn't.

1745
02:12:57,720 --> 02:12:59,012
Good morning.

1746
02:12:59,096 --> 02:13:01,139
I've called this meeting to discuss

1747
02:13:01,223 --> 02:13:03,558
a new type of check fraud
and counterfeiting.

1748
02:13:03,643 --> 02:13:05,852
The unsub is washing
and altering checks,

1749
02:13:05,936 --> 02:13:07,520
then passing them throughout Arizona.

1750
02:13:12,234 --> 02:13:16,363
This unsub is a big dog,
passing checks as large as five figures.

1751
02:13:19,784 --> 02:13:21,409
Sorry I'm late.

1752
02:13:22,703 --> 02:13:23,912
Sorry.

1753
02:13:28,125 --> 02:13:31,002
We have a recovered check
on Agent Reiter's desk.

1754
02:13:31,087 --> 02:13:33,797
Why don't we step out to the bullpen?

1755
02:13:38,219 --> 02:13:40,762
There's impressions on every line.

1756
02:13:42,431 --> 02:13:45,433
Looks like the original amount
was for $60.

1757
02:13:48,979 --> 02:13:50,897
Mind if I take a look?

1758
02:13:53,984 --> 02:13:56,403
Cashed in Flagstaff a week ago.

1759
02:13:59,156 --> 02:14:01,241
Cost the bank $16,000.

1760
02:14:02,910 --> 02:14:04,953
- It's a real check.
- Yeah.

1761
02:14:05,621 --> 02:14:09,040
It's been washed.
The only thing original is the signature.

1762
02:14:09,125 --> 02:14:10,834
But it's perfect.

1763
02:14:11,252 --> 02:14:14,170
I mean, this isn't hydrochloride
or bleach.

1764
02:14:14,338 --> 02:14:15,463
No.

1765
02:14:15,589 --> 02:14:17,132
Something new.

1766
02:14:17,299 --> 02:14:22,303
A nail polish remover where the acetone
removes the ink that's not been printed?

1767
02:14:25,433 --> 02:14:27,225
How did you do it, Frank?

1768
02:14:28,644 --> 02:14:31,813
How did you cheat on the bar exam
in Louisiana?

1769
02:14:36,986 --> 02:14:38,611
I didn't cheat.

1770
02:14:40,156 --> 02:14:42,866
I studied for two weeks and I passed.

1771
02:14:44,994 --> 02:14:48,705
Is that the truth?

1772
02:14:48,789 --> 02:14:51,958
I'll bet this guy steals checks
out of mailboxes.

1773
02:14:52,042 --> 02:14:55,170
He washes off their names
and puts on his own.

1774
02:14:56,630 --> 02:14:58,757
You're saying he's a local?

1775
02:14:58,841 --> 02:15:02,594
If it were me, I'd call the bank first.
Check out the balance...

1776
02:15:02,678 --> 02:15:04,971
Make sure there's enough money
in there to make it worth your while.

1777
02:15:05,055 --> 02:15:06,181
Exactly.

1778
02:15:06,515 --> 02:15:09,517
You know, Carl, I think
this guy is pretty smart.

1779
02:15:10,019 --> 02:15:12,395
Guess all we have to do now
is catch him.
