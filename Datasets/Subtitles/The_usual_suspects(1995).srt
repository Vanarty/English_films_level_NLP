1
00:03:34,463 --> 00:03:36,328
How you doing, Keaton?

2
00:03:39,769 --> 00:03:41,669
I can't feel my legs...

3
00:03:44,206 --> 00:03:45,605
Keyser.

4
00:03:49,779 --> 00:03:51,076
Ready?

5
00:04:02,725 --> 00:04:04,090
What time is it?

6
00:04:05,461 --> 00:04:06,621
12:30.

7
00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:15,163
It all started back in New York
six weeks ago.

8
00:05:15,297 --> 00:05:18,892
A truck loaded with stripped gun parts
got jacked outside of Queens.

9
00:05:18,968 --> 00:05:21,402
The driver didn't see anyone,
but someone fucked up.

10
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:24,098
He heard a voice.
Sometimes that's all you need.

11
00:05:27,743 --> 00:05:32,180
-Mr. McManus?
-Christ! Don't you fucking guys ever sleep?

12
00:05:32,681 --> 00:05:35,479
-We have a warrant for your arrest.
-Fuck you, pig.

13
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:44,726
Todd Hockney?

14
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:48,325
-Who wants to know?
-New York Police Department.

15
00:05:52,902 --> 00:05:54,733
-Shit.
-Freeze!

16
00:05:54,804 --> 00:05:56,135
Hold it!

17
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:02,907
Sure you brought enough guys?

18
00:06:38,681 --> 00:06:39,841
<i>It's quite simple:</i>

19
00:06:39,915 --> 00:06:44,784
A restaurant that changes with the taste
without losing the overall aesthetic.

20
00:06:44,854 --> 00:06:46,082
In other words...

21
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:49,249
...the atmosphere will not
be painted on the walls.

22
00:06:51,227 --> 00:06:54,424
-Let me give you an example--
-This I had to see for myself.

23
00:06:57,066 --> 00:06:58,055
David.

24
00:06:59,435 --> 00:07:02,404
-I'm in a meeting.
-Time for another one.

25
00:07:02,571 --> 00:07:04,937
Everyone, this is David Kujan.

26
00:07:05,241 --> 00:07:08,039
Special Agent Kujan. US Customs.

27
00:07:08,377 --> 00:07:11,904
These gentlemen
are from the New York Police Department.

28
00:07:12,047 --> 00:07:14,948
You look good.
Better than I would have thought.

29
00:07:16,819 --> 00:07:19,913
A small matter of a stolen truck
loaded with guns.

30
00:07:22,591 --> 00:07:23,956
Mr. Keaton?

31
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,591
Will you excuse us for a moment?

32
00:07:28,864 --> 00:07:32,595
We have some questions
to ask you downtown. You'll be a while.

33
00:07:33,168 --> 00:07:35,636
No. Please, sit down.

34
00:07:36,105 --> 00:07:39,199
This is a small problem.

35
00:07:40,142 --> 00:07:43,339
Enjoy the meal. I'll talk to you later.

36
00:08:05,467 --> 00:08:07,731
<i>It didn't make sense that I'd be there.</i>

37
00:08:07,803 --> 00:08:10,533
<i>These guys were hard-core hijackers...</i>

38
00:08:10,773 --> 00:08:12,536
<i>...but there I was.</i>

39
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:17,135
<i>At that point, I wasn't scared.</i>

40
00:08:17,212 --> 00:08:20,147
<i>I knew I hadn't done anything</i>
<i>they could do me for.</i>

41
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:22,813
<i>Besides, it was fun.</i>

42
00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:25,753
<i>I got to make like I was notorious.</i>

43
00:08:26,689 --> 00:08:28,247
<i>You all know the drill.</i>

44
00:08:28,324 --> 00:08:33,023
<i>When your number is called, step forward</i>
<i>and repeat the phrase you've been given.</i>

45
00:08:33,462 --> 00:08:35,430
<i>Number 1, step forward.</i>

46
00:08:39,969 --> 00:08:43,097
"Hand me the keys
you fucking cocksucker."

47
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,808
<i>Number 2, step forward.</i>

48
00:08:49,678 --> 00:08:53,307
Gimme the fuckin' keys,
you fuckin' cocksucker motherfucker!

49
00:08:53,382 --> 00:08:57,045
Knock it off. Get back.
Number 3, step forward.

50
00:09:06,028 --> 00:09:09,589
-"Hand me the keys, you cocksucker."
<i>-In English, please.</i>

51
00:09:09,832 --> 00:09:12,699
-Excuse me?
<i>-In English.</i>

52
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:16,438
Hand me the fuckin' keys, you cocksucker.
What the fuck?

53
00:09:16,505 --> 00:09:18,439
<i>Number 4, step forward.</i>

54
00:09:18,674 --> 00:09:21,472
<i>It was bullshit.</i>
<i>The whole rap was a setup.</i>

55
00:09:21,677 --> 00:09:24,737
"Hand me the keys
you fucking cocksucker."

56
00:09:25,014 --> 00:09:26,572
<i>It was the cops' fault.</i>

57
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:29,709
<i>You don't put guys like that</i>
<i>into a room together.</i>

58
00:09:29,885 --> 00:09:31,910
<i>Who knows what can happen?</i>

59
00:09:32,121 --> 00:09:35,454
"Hand me the keys
you fucking cocksucker."

60
00:09:36,291 --> 00:09:39,658
<i>This has really got to be embarrassing</i>
<i>for you guys.</i>

61
00:09:39,795 --> 00:09:40,989
<i>They drilled us all night.</i>

62
00:09:41,063 --> 00:09:44,328
<i>Someone was mad about that truck</i>
<i>hijacking and the cops had nothing.</i>

63
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:47,665
<i>They were hoping somebody would slip up</i>
<i>and give them something.</i>

64
00:09:47,736 --> 00:09:50,671
<i>They knew we wouldn't fight,</i>
<i>they knew how to lean on us.</i>

65
00:09:50,739 --> 00:09:53,867
<i>They've been doing it forever.</i>
<i>Our rights went out the window.</i>

66
00:09:53,942 --> 00:09:55,842
<i>It was a violation. Disgraceful.</i>

67
00:09:55,911 --> 00:09:58,744
<i>They went after McManus first.</i>
<i>Topnotch entry man.</i>

68
00:09:58,847 --> 00:10:00,246
What truck?

69
00:10:00,616 --> 00:10:03,744
-The truck with the guns, fucko.
-"Fucko"?

70
00:10:06,889 --> 00:10:09,221
<i>He was a good guy. Crazy, though.</i>

71
00:10:09,291 --> 00:10:11,384
Wanna know what your pal
Fenster told us?

72
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:13,189
-Say who?
-McManus.

73
00:10:13,262 --> 00:10:14,991
He told us another story.

74
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:18,791
Is that the one about
the hooker with the dysentery?

75
00:10:18,967 --> 00:10:22,061
<i>Fenster always worked with McManus.</i>
<i>He was a real tight-ass.</i>

76
00:10:22,137 --> 00:10:25,402
<i>But when it came to the job,</i>
<i>he was right on. A smart man.</i>

77
00:10:25,474 --> 00:10:28,170
-What are you saying?
-I said he'll flip you.

78
00:10:28,243 --> 00:10:31,212
-He'll what?
-Flip you. Flip you for real.

79
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,646
-I'm shaking. Come on.
-Okay.

80
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:36,742
-Answer my questions.
-Can you hear me in the back?

81
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:38,844
Hello?

82
00:10:39,421 --> 00:10:41,048
I want my lawyer.

83
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:43,950
I'm gonna have
your fuckin' badge, cocksucker.

84
00:10:44,359 --> 00:10:46,850
<i>Todd Hockney: good with explosives.</i>

85
00:10:47,329 --> 00:10:50,924
<i>Without a doubt, the one guy</i>
<i>who didn't give a fuck about anybody.</i>

86
00:10:51,066 --> 00:10:53,557
You guys don't have
a fuckin' leg to stand on.

87
00:10:53,635 --> 00:10:54,897
You think so, tough guy?

88
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:57,495
I can put you in Queens
during the hijacking.

89
00:10:57,573 --> 00:10:58,767
Really?

90
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:00,508
I live in Queens.

91
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:02,976
Did you put that
together yourself, Einstein?

92
00:11:03,045 --> 00:11:05,639
You got a team of monkeys
working full time on this?

93
00:11:05,714 --> 00:11:09,047
You know what happens
if you do another turn in the joint?

94
00:11:10,519 --> 00:11:13,113
I fuck your father in the shower,
and have a snack.

95
00:11:13,188 --> 00:11:16,521
-Are you gonna charge me, dickhead?
-I'll charge you when I'm ready.

96
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:19,390
-With what?
-You know damn well, dead man.

97
00:11:19,461 --> 00:11:20,485
<i>But Keaton?</i>

98
00:11:20,562 --> 00:11:23,224
<i>Keaton was the real prize for them</i>
<i>for obvious reasons.</i>

99
00:11:23,365 --> 00:11:26,027
It was your mistake, not mine.

100
00:11:28,704 --> 00:11:30,797
Did you ever stop to ask me?

101
00:11:32,307 --> 00:11:36,368
I've been walking around
with the same face, the same name.

102
00:11:37,813 --> 00:11:39,246
I'm a businessman.

103
00:11:39,314 --> 00:11:41,475
What's that? The restaurant business?

104
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:45,452
No. From now on you're in the
"getting fucked by us" business.

105
00:11:45,521 --> 00:11:47,955
I'm gonna make you famous, cocksucker.

106
00:11:48,023 --> 00:11:49,615
Like I said...

107
00:11:49,925 --> 00:11:52,018
...it was your mistake...

108
00:11:52,194 --> 00:11:53,627
...not mine.

109
00:11:54,096 --> 00:11:56,428
You charge me with this shit...

110
00:11:57,566 --> 00:11:59,363
...and I'll beat it.

111
00:12:00,302 --> 00:12:01,326
Okay?

112
00:12:02,371 --> 00:12:05,135
Let's get back to the truck, asshole.

113
00:12:06,608 --> 00:12:09,668
Really, somebody's got to do something
about this shit.

114
00:12:09,745 --> 00:12:13,146
They put me in holding every five minutes.
So I did a little time.

115
00:12:13,215 --> 00:12:17,675
Does that mean I get railed every time
a truck finds it's way gone?

116
00:12:17,753 --> 00:12:19,015
Fuck 'em.

117
00:12:19,454 --> 00:12:21,354
Fenster, will you relax?

118
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:25,888
-These guys don't have any probable cause.
-You fuckin' right. No PC.

119
00:12:25,961 --> 00:12:29,419
You're goddamn right.
You do some time, never let you go.

120
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:31,989
They treat me like a criminal.

121
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:35,030
-I'll end up a criminal.
-You are a criminal.

122
00:12:36,605 --> 00:12:39,073
Why'd you got to go and do that?

123
00:12:39,374 --> 00:12:42,901
-I'm trying to make a point.
-Why don't you make your point?

124
00:12:42,978 --> 00:12:45,173
You're making me tired all over.

125
00:12:45,314 --> 00:12:46,372
Fuck it then.

126
00:12:47,082 --> 00:12:49,243
-I heard you were dead.
-Yeah?

127
00:12:49,585 --> 00:12:52,554
-You heard right.
-Word I got is you hung up your spurs.

128
00:12:53,255 --> 00:12:56,088
-What's that all about?
-What's this?

129
00:12:56,391 --> 00:13:00,953
Rumor has it Keaton's gone straight.
I hear he's tapping Edie Finneran.

130
00:13:01,029 --> 00:13:02,053
Who's that?

131
00:13:02,264 --> 00:13:04,755
She's a heavyweight criminal
lawyer from uptown.

132
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:06,767
I hear she's Keaton's meal ticket.

133
00:13:06,969 --> 00:13:08,766
How 'bout it, Keaton?

134
00:13:08,971 --> 00:13:10,666
You a lawyer's wife?

135
00:13:11,406 --> 00:13:13,374
What kind of retainer you giving her?

136
00:13:17,045 --> 00:13:18,910
Do your friend a favor...

137
00:13:19,648 --> 00:13:21,377
...tell him to keep quiet.

138
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:23,874
Dean Keaton...

139
00:13:25,354 --> 00:13:26,946
Gone clean?

140
00:13:27,456 --> 00:13:29,048
Say it ain't so.

141
00:13:29,358 --> 00:13:32,657
-Or was it you that hit that truck?
-Mac, forget him.

142
00:13:32,995 --> 00:13:35,225
Did you get to talk to your lawyer?

143
00:13:35,964 --> 00:13:37,795
This whole thing was a shakedown.

144
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:41,592
-What makes you say that?
-How many times you been in a lineup?

145
00:13:42,771 --> 00:13:44,932
It's always you and four dummies.

146
00:13:45,007 --> 00:13:48,272
The PD are paying homeless guys
$10 a head half the time.

147
00:13:48,543 --> 00:13:51,740
There's no way they'd line
five felons in the same row.

148
00:13:52,014 --> 00:13:55,677
What's a voice lineup?
Public defender could get you out of that.

149
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:59,243
-Why the hell was I strip searched?
-It was the feds.

150
00:13:59,488 --> 00:14:01,820
A truckload of guns gets snagged.

151
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:05,656
Customs comes down on NYPD
for answers. They come up with us.

152
00:14:05,894 --> 00:14:09,022
-They're clutching at straws.
-I had a guy's finger up my ass.

153
00:14:09,197 --> 00:14:10,459
Is it Friday already?

154
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:13,795
Yeah, lover boy.

155
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:17,030
You want a piece? Jump in. I'll love you.

156
00:14:17,239 --> 00:14:20,902
So who in the goddamn piss hell
stole our fucking truck?

157
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:24,870
-What did you say?
-Who stole the fucking truck?

158
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:28,075
-I don't want to know.
-Who asked you, workingman?

159
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:30,880
Fuck who did it.
What I want to know is, who's the gimp?

160
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:33,217
-He's okay.
-Says you. How do I know that?

161
00:14:33,288 --> 00:14:35,381
What about it, pretzel man?
What's your story?

162
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:36,754
His name is Verbal.

163
00:14:37,492 --> 00:14:38,823
Verbal Kint.

164
00:14:38,894 --> 00:14:40,384
-Verbal?
-Yeah.

165
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:43,590
Roger, really. People say I talk too much.

166
00:14:43,832 --> 00:14:45,732
I was going to tell you to shut up.

167
00:14:45,901 --> 00:14:49,530
-We met before, once or twice.
-In County. I was in for fraud.

168
00:14:49,604 --> 00:14:51,868
You were in a lineup then, too.
What happened?

169
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:54,873
I walked. 90 days, suspended.

170
00:14:55,177 --> 00:14:57,941
-So you did it.
-All right, now look...

171
00:14:59,314 --> 00:15:02,078
...we've all been put out
by this whole thing, right?

172
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:05,981
I figure we owe it to ourselves
to salvage a little dignity.

173
00:15:06,488 --> 00:15:09,753
Now, me and Fenster
heard about a little job.

174
00:15:09,891 --> 00:15:11,688
Why don't you just calm down?

175
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,094
What do you care what he has to say?

176
00:15:15,163 --> 00:15:17,028
I'm just talking here.

177
00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:20,525
It seems to me like Mr. Hockney
wants to hear it...

178
00:15:20,602 --> 00:15:22,593
...and I know Fenster's down.

179
00:15:23,438 --> 00:15:25,201
What about you, guy?

180
00:15:26,575 --> 00:15:27,940
I'm interested.

181
00:15:29,211 --> 00:15:30,405
There. See?

182
00:15:30,779 --> 00:15:33,805
I'd like to exercise my right
to free assembly.

183
00:15:34,049 --> 00:15:35,846
Why don't you just shut up?

184
00:15:41,923 --> 00:15:43,481
You're missing the point.

185
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:45,217
No.

186
00:15:46,328 --> 00:15:48,296
You're missing the point.

187
00:15:48,497 --> 00:15:50,931
I don't want to hear anything from you.

188
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,491
I don't care about your job.

189
00:15:55,337 --> 00:15:56,463
And...

190
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:01,165
...I want nothing to do with any of you.

191
00:16:01,643 --> 00:16:04,840
I beg your pardon,
but you can all go to hell.

192
00:16:07,516 --> 00:16:08,813
Dean Keaton...

193
00:16:09,584 --> 00:16:11,074
...gone the high road.

194
00:16:12,621 --> 00:16:14,714
What is the world coming to?

195
00:16:19,728 --> 00:16:20,990
Fuck him.

196
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,361
<i>And that was how it started:</i>

197
00:16:27,436 --> 00:16:29,836
<i>Five of us brought in</i>
<i>on a trumped-up charge...</i>

198
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:31,873
<i>...to be leaned on by half-wits.</i>

199
00:16:35,177 --> 00:16:37,645
I really can't talk about it much here.

200
00:16:37,712 --> 00:16:41,307
<i>What the cops never figured out,</i>
<i>and what I know now...</i>

201
00:16:41,383 --> 00:16:44,648
<i>...was that these men would never break,</i>
<i>never lie down.</i>

202
00:16:45,554 --> 00:16:47,647
<i>Never bend over for anybody.</i>

203
00:16:48,657 --> 00:16:49,885
<i>Anybody.</i>

204
00:17:05,841 --> 00:17:09,038
-Who are you?
-Agent Jack Baer, FBI.

205
00:17:09,311 --> 00:17:11,370
-How many dead?
-15 so far.

206
00:17:11,446 --> 00:17:14,244
They're still pulling bodies
out of the water.

207
00:17:14,382 --> 00:17:16,350
-Any survivors?
-Two.

208
00:17:16,418 --> 00:17:19,216
One guy's in County hospital,
but he's in a coma.

209
00:17:19,287 --> 00:17:22,381
The DA has a second guy,
a cripple from New York.

210
00:17:22,457 --> 00:17:24,823
The chief wants this place sealed off.

211
00:17:24,926 --> 00:17:27,759
If you have any questions, give him a call.

212
00:18:01,863 --> 00:18:05,162
<i>This is Dave Kujan.</i>
<i>I'll be in Los Angeles until Tuesday.</i>

213
00:18:05,267 --> 00:18:09,465
<i>If you need to reach me, contact Jeff Rabin</i>
<i>of the San Pedro Police Department...</i>

214
00:18:09,538 --> 00:18:12,371
<i>...at extension 112. Have a nice day.</i>

215
00:18:16,545 --> 00:18:18,706
<i>-Why can't I see him?</i>
<i>-I told you...</i>

216
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:21,772
...the DA came down here
last night ready to arraign...

217
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:23,909
...even before they moved him to County.

218
00:18:23,985 --> 00:18:26,351
Kint's lawyer shows up five minutes later...

219
00:18:26,421 --> 00:18:29,948
...the DA comes out looking like
the bogeyman smacked him around.

220
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:33,153
They take his statement,
and they cut him a deal.

221
00:18:33,228 --> 00:18:37,255
-Did they charge him with anything?
-Weapons, misdemeanor 2.

222
00:18:37,632 --> 00:18:39,099
What is that?

223
00:18:39,668 --> 00:18:43,263
I give the DA credit for getting that much,
you understand?

224
00:18:43,338 --> 00:18:44,862
Excuse me, sir.

225
00:18:46,074 --> 00:18:50,033
This whole thing has turned political.
The mayor was here last night.

226
00:18:50,111 --> 00:18:53,444
The chief. This morning,
the governor called, okay?

227
00:18:53,515 --> 00:18:57,713
I'm telling you, this guy is protected
from up on high by the Prince of Darkness.

228
00:18:57,786 --> 00:19:00,220
-Take my word for it.
-When does he post bail?

229
00:19:00,288 --> 00:19:02,518
-Maybe two hours, tops.
-I want to see him.

230
00:19:02,591 --> 00:19:04,456
-No.
-I gotta see him.

231
00:19:04,526 --> 00:19:07,188
-No. I can't--
-You gotta do this for me.

232
00:19:07,262 --> 00:19:09,492
I came a long way for this.

233
00:19:10,165 --> 00:19:11,632
Dave, please.

234
00:19:15,136 --> 00:19:18,003
Even if I let you talk to him,
he won't talk to you.

235
00:19:19,474 --> 00:19:21,305
He's paranoid about being recorded.

236
00:19:21,376 --> 00:19:23,970
-He knows the rooms are wired.
-I quit.

237
00:19:24,045 --> 00:19:27,014
This won't be an interrogation,
just a friendly chat.

238
00:19:27,215 --> 00:19:30,309
-He won't go into the interrogation room.
-Then someplace else.

239
00:19:30,385 --> 00:19:31,545
Where?

240
00:19:33,588 --> 00:19:34,816
No, no.

241
00:19:35,123 --> 00:19:38,752
If this was a dope deal, where's the dope?
If it was a hit, who called it?

242
00:19:38,827 --> 00:19:42,319
I'm sure you have a host of wild theories
to answer all these questions.

243
00:19:42,397 --> 00:19:45,764
-You know what I think.
-That's crazy, and it doesn't even matter.

244
00:19:45,834 --> 00:19:48,701
The guy's got total immunity.
His story checks out.

245
00:19:49,004 --> 00:19:53,236
-He doesn't know what you want to know.
-I don't think he does, not exactly.

246
00:19:53,575 --> 00:19:56,237
But there's a lot more to his story,
believe me.

247
00:19:56,611 --> 00:20:00,240
I wanna know why
27 men died on that pier...

248
00:20:00,315 --> 00:20:04,615
...for what looks to be $91 million
worth of dope that wasn't there.

249
00:20:04,853 --> 00:20:08,289
And above all,
I want to be sure Dean Keaton's dead.

250
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:10,052
He's dead.

251
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:13,484
Come on. Two hours.
Just till he makes bail.

252
00:20:13,862 --> 00:20:15,295
They're all dead.

253
00:20:15,363 --> 00:20:17,661
I don't care how tough
you say Keaton was...

254
00:20:17,732 --> 00:20:20,633
...nobody on that boat
could've come out alive.

255
00:20:23,872 --> 00:20:26,864
-Is he talking?
-He regained consciousness an hour ago.

256
00:20:26,941 --> 00:20:29,375
He spoke, not English, then he lapsed.

257
00:20:29,544 --> 00:20:31,944
-Hungarian?
-That might have been it.

258
00:20:32,013 --> 00:20:34,914
-Most of them were Hungarians.
-You gotta put this on.

259
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:37,645
Burn victims are very susceptible
to infection.

260
00:20:38,186 --> 00:20:40,654
And, of course, there's no smoking.

261
00:20:50,365 --> 00:20:52,993
Keep your mask up.
Please don't touch him.

262
00:20:53,068 --> 00:20:54,194
Is he gonna die?

263
00:20:54,302 --> 00:20:56,930
He's burned 60 percent of his body,
broken ribs--

264
00:20:57,005 --> 00:20:59,667
Call security. Put a man on the door.

265
00:20:59,741 --> 00:21:01,902
-Is he dangerous?
-Yes.

266
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:03,302
Do it.

267
00:21:03,878 --> 00:21:05,243
Do it now.

268
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:10,750
Joel? Baer. Down at LA County.

269
00:21:10,919 --> 00:21:14,878
Look, the guy they pulled out of the harbor
is Arkosh Kovash.

270
00:21:15,023 --> 00:21:16,786
Yes, I'm sure.

271
00:21:17,292 --> 00:21:18,987
No, he's all fucked up.

272
00:21:20,829 --> 00:21:22,456
I can't hear you.

273
00:21:23,098 --> 00:21:25,157
Will you shut up? I'm on the phone.

274
00:21:25,767 --> 00:21:26,791
Yes.

275
00:21:27,736 --> 00:21:29,670
No, not till I put a man on him.

276
00:21:29,804 --> 00:21:32,170
Send me someone
who can speak Hungarian.

277
00:21:32,307 --> 00:21:35,037
He's awake.
He's talking like a Thai hooker.

278
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:36,475
Keyser Soze.

279
00:21:37,712 --> 00:21:40,010
-What?
-Keyser Soze!

280
00:21:44,919 --> 00:21:46,147
No shit?

281
00:21:47,622 --> 00:21:50,420
Call Dan Metzheiser over at Justice...

282
00:21:50,759 --> 00:21:53,023
...and find Dave Kujan from Customs.

283
00:22:27,061 --> 00:22:30,360
Verbal, this is Agent Kujan from Customs.

284
00:22:31,166 --> 00:22:32,633
Nice to meet you.

285
00:22:32,767 --> 00:22:35,292
He wants to ask you a few questions
before you go.

286
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:38,828
-What about?
-About a Dean Keaton, mostly.

287
00:22:40,074 --> 00:22:42,542
I'd like to start at the lineup
back in New York.

288
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:45,943
-Can I get some coffee?
-In a while. Let's talk about the lineup.

289
00:22:46,114 --> 00:22:49,413
I'm really thirsty.
I used to dehydrate as a kid.

290
00:22:49,484 --> 00:22:51,850
Once I got so bad
my piss come out like snot.

291
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:54,946
-It was all thick and gooey--
-I'll get your fucking coffee.

292
00:22:55,023 --> 00:22:57,583
Get me one, too, while you're at it.

293
00:23:01,996 --> 00:23:03,691
That guy is tense.

294
00:23:03,932 --> 00:23:05,593
Tension is a killer.

295
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:08,669
I used to be in a barbershop quartet
in Skokie, lllinois.

296
00:23:08,736 --> 00:23:11,671
The baritone was this guy
named Kip Diskin, big fat guy.

297
00:23:11,773 --> 00:23:14,401
Like, orca fat.
He was so stressed in the morning--

298
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:18,435
-You know we're trying to help you.
-Sure, and I appreciate that.

299
00:23:18,513 --> 00:23:21,641
And I wanna help you, Agent Kujan.
I like cops.

300
00:23:21,716 --> 00:23:24,310
I would've liked to have been a fed,
but my CP--

301
00:23:24,385 --> 00:23:28,344
You're not tellin' us everything.
I know you know something.

302
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:30,558
<i>I told the DA everything I know.</i>

303
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:34,860
<i>I know you like Keaton.</i>

304
00:23:35,597 --> 00:23:39,089
<i>-I know you think he's a good man.</i>
<i>-I know he was good.</i>

305
00:23:39,167 --> 00:23:40,600
<i>He was a corrupt cop.</i>

306
00:23:40,668 --> 00:23:43,398
<i>Sure. 15 years ago,</i>
<i>but he was a good thief.</i>

307
00:23:44,239 --> 00:23:46,104
The cops wouldn't let him go legit.

308
00:23:46,174 --> 00:23:48,301
Dean Keaton was a piece of shit.

309
00:23:51,346 --> 00:23:54,110
Are you trying to get a rise out of me?

310
00:23:54,949 --> 00:23:58,009
-I just wanna hear your story.
-It's all there.

311
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,683
May I have a cigarette?

312
00:24:03,892 --> 00:24:06,793
-According to your statement--
-I need a light.

313
00:24:09,898 --> 00:24:13,129
According to your statement,
you're a short-con operator...

314
00:24:13,201 --> 00:24:14,828
...run-of-the-mill--

315
00:24:19,173 --> 00:24:22,700
According to your statement,
you're a short-con operator...

316
00:24:23,444 --> 00:24:25,002
...run-of-the-mill scams.

317
00:24:25,079 --> 00:24:27,843
It's been suppressed.
Anything in there is inadmissible.

318
00:24:27,916 --> 00:24:31,215
I know. Sweet deal you have here.
Total immunity.

319
00:24:33,488 --> 00:24:37,891
I do have the weapons charge.
I'm lookin' at six whole months hard time.

320
00:24:37,959 --> 00:24:40,018
You know a dealer named Ruby Deemer?

321
00:24:41,462 --> 00:24:43,589
You know a religious guy
named John Paul?

322
00:24:43,798 --> 00:24:46,767
-You know Ruby's in Attica?
-He didn't have my lawyer.

323
00:24:46,834 --> 00:24:48,734
I know Ruby. He's big on respect.

324
00:24:48,803 --> 00:24:51,294
He's a good friend of mine,
likes me very much.

325
00:24:51,372 --> 00:24:54,341
I know your testimony is sealed.
Ruby's well connected.

326
00:24:54,409 --> 00:24:57,105
He's got lots of friends inside
who do favors for him.

327
00:24:57,178 --> 00:25:01,012
What would he say if he found out
you dropped his name to the DA?

328
00:25:01,349 --> 00:25:04,807
-There's nothing there on Ruby.
-I'll be sure to mention that to him.

329
00:25:04,886 --> 00:25:07,946
Know what I've learned on the job?
How to spot a murderer.

330
00:25:08,022 --> 00:25:10,388
Say you arrest three guys
for the same killing.

331
00:25:10,458 --> 00:25:11,925
Put them in jail overnight.

332
00:25:11,993 --> 00:25:14,325
Next morning,
whoever's sleeping is your man.

333
00:25:14,395 --> 00:25:18,024
If you're guilty, you know you're caught.
You let your guard down.

334
00:25:18,132 --> 00:25:20,327
-You follow me?
-No.

335
00:25:20,635 --> 00:25:22,068
Let me get to the point.

336
00:25:24,005 --> 00:25:28,066
I'm smarter than you,
and I'm gonna find out what I wanna know.

337
00:25:28,142 --> 00:25:30,440
I'll get it, whether you like it or not.

338
00:25:31,646 --> 00:25:33,136
I'm not a rat.

339
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,714
Thanks.

340
00:25:45,059 --> 00:25:48,825
When I was pickin' beans in Guatemala
we used to make fresh coffee.

341
00:25:48,896 --> 00:25:51,956
Right off the trees, I mean. That was good.

342
00:25:52,033 --> 00:25:55,901
-This is shit, but I'm in a police station.
-Can we get started again?

343
00:25:55,970 --> 00:25:58,200
What happened after the lineup?

344
00:26:04,112 --> 00:26:07,104
The desk sergeant was telling me
he couldn't release you.

345
00:26:07,181 --> 00:26:10,309
Can you believe that?
You weren't even charged.

346
00:26:10,385 --> 00:26:11,784
Damn police.

347
00:26:14,455 --> 00:26:16,946
I wanna have pictures taken of your face.

348
00:26:17,025 --> 00:26:20,119
-I'll take them to the DA tomorrow.
-Forget about it.

349
00:26:20,194 --> 00:26:22,958
I'll have this thing in front
of a grand jury by Monday.

350
00:26:23,031 --> 00:26:24,965
I don't want to talk about it, okay?

351
00:26:27,935 --> 00:26:29,766
What did Fortier and Renault say?

352
00:26:30,371 --> 00:26:32,931
They asked for more time
to think about investing.

353
00:26:33,007 --> 00:26:34,099
Damn it.

354
00:26:34,609 --> 00:26:35,803
More time for what?

355
00:26:36,277 --> 00:26:39,735
No matter how you cover my tracks
they're still gonna find out about me.

356
00:26:40,248 --> 00:26:41,977
Give me some credit.

357
00:26:42,216 --> 00:26:44,548
I got you this far.
Let's go to the grand jury.

358
00:26:44,619 --> 00:26:48,715
-This isn't gonna stop if we don't--
-It's never going to stop, period.

359
00:26:49,323 --> 00:26:53,521
By next week, every investor in the city
is gonna be walking away from us.

360
00:26:55,129 --> 00:26:56,460
It's finished.

361
00:26:56,698 --> 00:26:58,165
I'm finished.

362
00:27:03,805 --> 00:27:06,000
Don't give up on me now.

363
00:27:08,042 --> 00:27:10,010
It's never gonna stop.

364
00:27:17,285 --> 00:27:18,650
I love you.

365
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:22,019
They ruined me in there tonight.

366
00:27:24,025 --> 00:27:25,390
I love you.

367
00:27:26,994 --> 00:27:28,120
Do you hear me?

368
00:27:35,336 --> 00:27:36,428
What?

369
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,371
All right.

370
00:27:41,476 --> 00:27:43,467
Let's just go to my place.

371
00:27:58,793 --> 00:28:00,784
We'll worry about this tomorrow.

372
00:28:04,899 --> 00:28:06,457
Let's go.

373
00:28:08,936 --> 00:28:11,632
<i>Fenster and McManus</i>
<i>had a cagey proposition:</i>

374
00:28:11,706 --> 00:28:14,300
<i>A fast-jump, high-risk, long money.</i>

375
00:28:14,709 --> 00:28:16,438
<i>We all knew it could be done.</i>

376
00:28:16,577 --> 00:28:19,341
<i>The way I figured,</i>
<i>to do it wrong meant killing.</i>

377
00:28:19,413 --> 00:28:21,608
<i>To do it right took five men.</i>

378
00:28:22,116 --> 00:28:23,981
<i>Five men meant Keaton.</i>

379
00:28:25,219 --> 00:28:27,119
<i>Keaton took convincing.</i>

380
00:28:29,624 --> 00:28:31,854
New York's finest taxi service.

381
00:28:32,693 --> 00:28:33,955
Bullshit.

382
00:28:34,762 --> 00:28:36,024
Bullshit.

383
00:28:37,265 --> 00:28:39,290
They don't operate anymore.

384
00:28:39,567 --> 00:28:43,628
McManus has a friend in the 14th precinct.
They're coming out for one job, Thursday.

385
00:28:43,704 --> 00:28:46,639
They're pickin' up a guy
smuggling emeralds from South America.

386
00:28:46,707 --> 00:28:48,504
McManus already has a fence set up.

387
00:28:48,576 --> 00:28:51,511
-A fence? Who?
-Some guy in California called Redfoot.

388
00:28:51,579 --> 00:28:54,571
-I never heard of him.
-You have to come.

389
00:28:54,649 --> 00:28:59,143
-What's it to you whether I do it or not?
-They don't know me. You do.

390
00:28:59,387 --> 00:29:01,753
They won't take me unless you go.

391
00:29:02,123 --> 00:29:03,852
Look at me. I need this.

392
00:29:04,859 --> 00:29:08,124
You're telling me you don't need this?
Is this your place?

393
00:29:08,563 --> 00:29:12,021
I'm not knocking you. You got
a good scam going with this lawyer.

394
00:29:16,804 --> 00:29:17,964
Sorry.

395
00:29:18,906 --> 00:29:20,806
It's okay.

396
00:29:22,043 --> 00:29:24,773
You say it's the real thing? That's cool.

397
00:29:27,381 --> 00:29:28,575
You okay?

398
00:29:28,983 --> 00:29:30,644
I was out of line.

399
00:29:31,452 --> 00:29:34,319
But they're never gonna stop with us.
You know that.

400
00:29:34,388 --> 00:29:37,118
As clean as you get,
they'll never let you go now.

401
00:29:37,191 --> 00:29:41,218
This way, we hit the cops where it hurts,
and we get well in the meantime.

402
00:29:45,132 --> 00:29:46,793
You sure you're okay?

403
00:29:47,401 --> 00:29:48,800
I'll be all right.

404
00:30:03,317 --> 00:30:04,648
Look, I...

405
00:30:05,419 --> 00:30:07,887
-...sometimes get--
-Forget it.

406
00:30:11,292 --> 00:30:13,624
I'll probably shit blood tonight.

407
00:30:24,639 --> 00:30:25,901
So...

408
00:30:28,542 --> 00:30:30,442
...how do they wanna do it?

409
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:34,643
McManus wants to go in shooting.
I say no.

410
00:30:36,284 --> 00:30:38,445
Fenster? Hockney?

411
00:30:38,619 --> 00:30:41,315
They're pretty pissed off.
They'll do anything.

412
00:30:41,455 --> 00:30:43,821
I got a way to do it without killing anyone.

413
00:30:43,891 --> 00:30:47,190
But like I say,
they won't let me in without you.

414
00:31:05,313 --> 00:31:06,678
$3 million?

415
00:31:08,649 --> 00:31:10,014
Maybe more.

416
00:31:14,655 --> 00:31:16,020
No killing.

417
00:31:17,725 --> 00:31:19,590
Not if we do it my way.

418
00:31:53,561 --> 00:31:56,758
<i>New York's finest taxi service</i>
<i>was not your normal taxi service.</i>

419
00:31:56,831 --> 00:32:00,790
<i>It was a ring of corrupt cops in the NYPD</i>
<i>that ran a high-profit racket...</i>

420
00:32:00,868 --> 00:32:03,359
<i>...driving smugglers and drug dealers</i>
<i>all over the city.</i>

421
00:32:03,437 --> 00:32:06,099
<i>For $300 a mile,</i>
<i>you got your own blue and white...</i>

422
00:32:06,173 --> 00:32:09,199
<i>...and a police escort.</i>
<i>They even had their own business cards.</i>

423
00:32:09,276 --> 00:32:13,474
<i>After a while, somebody started asking</i>
<i>questions, and the taxi service shut down.</i>

424
00:32:13,547 --> 00:32:17,176
<i>Ever since then, Internal Affairs</i>
<i>has been waiting to catch them in the act.</i>

425
00:32:17,251 --> 00:32:18,809
<i>That's where we came in.</i>

426
00:32:19,153 --> 00:32:22,350
-So, how was the flight?
-Fuckin' great.

427
00:32:24,225 --> 00:32:26,625
Will this get me to Staten Island?

428
00:32:27,395 --> 00:32:30,125
Are you kiddin' me?
This will get you to Cape Cod.

429
00:32:30,297 --> 00:32:33,130
<i>McManus came to us with the job.</i>
<i>Fenster got the vans.</i>

430
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,827
<i>Hockney supplied the hardware.</i>

431
00:32:34,902 --> 00:32:37,564
<i>I came through with</i>
<i>how to do it so no one got killed.</i>

432
00:32:37,638 --> 00:32:41,233
<i>But Keaton?</i>
<i>Keaton put on the finishing touch.</i>

433
00:32:41,308 --> 00:32:44,937
<i>A little "fuck you" from the five</i>
<i>of us to the NYPD.</i>

434
00:32:48,249 --> 00:32:49,477
Watch this.

435
00:32:50,651 --> 00:32:51,675
Careful.

436
00:32:51,952 --> 00:32:53,613
Come on, asshole!

437
00:32:55,022 --> 00:32:56,353
Holy shit!

438
00:32:57,358 --> 00:33:00,486
-Don't move, you fucker!
-Drop it now, motherfucker!

439
00:33:00,561 --> 00:33:02,620
Drop the fuckin' gun! Drop it!

440
00:33:02,696 --> 00:33:04,721
Don't fuckin' touch a fuckin' thing.

441
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:07,427
-What do you guys want?
-Put your fuckin' thing away.

442
00:33:07,535 --> 00:33:09,526
We're cops! Stupid assholes!

443
00:33:09,737 --> 00:33:12,297
-Watch the glass!
-Don't fuckin' move, motherfucker!

444
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:15,638
-You want a buckshot shampoo, chubby?
-Shut up!

445
00:33:18,179 --> 00:33:19,612
Fuck.

446
00:33:21,949 --> 00:33:24,645
'Afternoon, my little pork chops.
Give me the shit.

447
00:33:24,718 --> 00:33:26,379
-Don't move!
-Give him the shit!

448
00:33:26,454 --> 00:33:28,445
Give him the fuckin' thing!

449
00:33:28,522 --> 00:33:30,353
Give him the fuckin' shit, man!

450
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:32,751
Hurry up! Come on!

451
00:33:33,194 --> 00:33:35,094
-Now the money!
-There's no money.

452
00:33:35,162 --> 00:33:38,131
-Give me the money now!
-There's no fuckin' money.

453
00:33:38,265 --> 00:33:39,823
Give him the fuckin' money!

454
00:33:40,167 --> 00:33:42,601
-Do it! Give him the money!
-Give me the money!

455
00:33:42,803 --> 00:33:45,067
-Give him the money!
-Hurry up!

456
00:33:45,973 --> 00:33:48,032
You know who the fuck I am?

457
00:33:48,242 --> 00:33:50,904
You people know
who the fuck I am? Fuck!

458
00:33:51,579 --> 00:33:53,308
We do now, jerk-off.

459
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:55,412
Cocksucker.

460
00:34:00,254 --> 00:34:02,222
Wait a minute. What's that?

461
00:34:04,692 --> 00:34:05,716
What the fuck?

462
00:34:06,327 --> 00:34:07,624
Holy shit!

463
00:34:10,297 --> 00:34:11,321
Go!

464
00:34:24,311 --> 00:34:26,302
<i>Keaton made an anonymous phone call.</i>

465
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:28,940
<i>The press was on the scene</i>
<i>before the police were.</i>

466
00:34:29,016 --> 00:34:31,484
<i>Strausz and Rizzi</i>
<i>were indicted three days later.</i>

467
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:34,385
<i>Within a few weeks,</i>
<i>50 more cops went down with them.</i>

468
00:34:34,722 --> 00:34:38,385
<i>Everybody got it right in the ass,</i>
<i>from the chief on down.</i>

469
00:34:38,459 --> 00:34:40,086
<i>It was beautiful.</i>

470
00:34:48,269 --> 00:34:49,793
I owe you $2.50.

471
00:34:51,372 --> 00:34:52,737
Dr. Keaton.

472
00:34:55,509 --> 00:34:59,070
-There's more here than I thought.
-When's the fence coming?

473
00:34:59,446 --> 00:35:02,040
Redfoot never comes to see me.
I always go to see him.

474
00:35:03,450 --> 00:35:04,940
In California?

475
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:08,853
Yes, Verbal, in California. Fenster and I--

476
00:35:08,923 --> 00:35:12,984
Wait, hold the fuckin' phone.
You and Fenster? No.

477
00:35:13,394 --> 00:35:17,228
-You fuckin' kiddin' me?
-So then, who's gonna go?

478
00:35:18,065 --> 00:35:19,396
We all go.

479
00:35:21,135 --> 00:35:23,433
What's your fuckin' problem, man?

480
00:35:23,671 --> 00:35:27,107
My problem, is you and Fenster
honeymooning in California...

481
00:35:27,174 --> 00:35:30,268
...while the rest of us are sittin' here
holding our dicks.

482
00:35:30,477 --> 00:35:32,001
The job's over.

483
00:35:32,513 --> 00:35:33,741
Cool it.

484
00:35:34,481 --> 00:35:37,041
LA's a good place to lay low for a while.

485
00:35:39,787 --> 00:35:41,186
You wanna dance?

486
00:35:48,762 --> 00:35:49,956
Ladies.

487
00:35:57,838 --> 00:35:59,738
I would like to propose a toast.

488
00:36:01,208 --> 00:36:02,698
There you go.

489
00:36:05,279 --> 00:36:06,769
To Mr. Verbal...

490
00:36:08,482 --> 00:36:10,450
...the man with the plan.

491
00:36:23,464 --> 00:36:25,193
<i>We're gonna miss the flight.</i>

492
00:36:26,267 --> 00:36:29,361
Don't do this.
Send her a note. Something.

493
00:36:30,170 --> 00:36:31,967
I said we'll make it.

494
00:37:05,806 --> 00:37:08,001
We're gonna miss the plane.

495
00:37:09,243 --> 00:37:10,904
She'll understand.

496
00:37:30,464 --> 00:37:33,456
That's heartwarming. Really.

497
00:37:35,069 --> 00:37:36,400
I'm weepy.

498
00:37:37,538 --> 00:37:39,563
You wanna wait outside?

499
00:37:42,643 --> 00:37:45,942
You guys wanted to know what happened.
I'm telling you.

500
00:37:46,013 --> 00:37:47,503
Come on, Verbal.

501
00:37:47,715 --> 00:37:52,550
Who do you think you're talkin' to?
You expect me to believe that he retired?

502
00:37:53,554 --> 00:37:54,953
For a woman?

503
00:37:56,824 --> 00:37:59,418
Bullshit. Keaton was using her.

504
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:02,153
-He loved her.
-Sure.

505
00:38:02,229 --> 00:38:05,687
<i>I'm supposed to believe that hitting</i>
<i>the taxi service wasn't his idea.</i>

506
00:38:05,766 --> 00:38:09,532
<i>-It was all Fenster and McManus.</i>
<i>-Keaton was a cop for four years.</i>

507
00:38:09,603 --> 00:38:11,503
<i>Who else would know better?</i>

508
00:38:11,572 --> 00:38:14,370
<i>-That job had his name on it.</i>
<i>-Edie had him turned around.</i>

509
00:38:14,808 --> 00:38:16,605
Let me tell you something.

510
00:38:16,677 --> 00:38:18,338
I know Dean Keaton.

511
00:38:18,412 --> 00:38:21,210
I've been investigating him
for the past three years.

512
00:38:21,281 --> 00:38:23,875
The guy I know
was a cold-blooded bastard.

513
00:38:24,284 --> 00:38:28,482
IAD indicted him on three counts of
murder before he was kicked off the force.

514
00:38:28,555 --> 00:38:30,853
Don't sell me the hooker
with a heart of gold.

515
00:38:30,991 --> 00:38:32,481
You got him all wrong.

516
00:38:33,627 --> 00:38:34,719
Do I?

517
00:38:35,329 --> 00:38:39,629
Dean Keaton was under indictment
seven times while he was on the force.

518
00:38:39,767 --> 00:38:43,259
In every case,
witnesses either reversed their testimony...

519
00:38:43,837 --> 00:38:46,237
...or died before they could testify.

520
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:51,309
When they finally did nail him for fraud,
he spent five years in Sing Sing.

521
00:38:51,512 --> 00:38:53,480
He killed three prisoners inside.

522
00:38:54,014 --> 00:38:56,209
Of course, I can't prove this...

523
00:38:57,484 --> 00:39:00,112
...but I can't prove the best part either.

524
00:39:01,455 --> 00:39:03,184
Dean Keaton was dead.

525
00:39:04,324 --> 00:39:05,450
Did you know that?

526
00:39:05,726 --> 00:39:09,457
He died in a fire two years ago,
during an investigation into the murder...

527
00:39:09,530 --> 00:39:12,624
...of a witness who was going
to testify against him.

528
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,792
Two people saw Dean Keaton
walk into a warehouse he owned...

529
00:39:15,869 --> 00:39:17,632
...just before it blew up.

530
00:39:18,005 --> 00:39:21,133
They said he went in
to check a leaking gas main.

531
00:39:21,875 --> 00:39:24,935
It blew up and took all
of Dean Keaton with it.

532
00:39:26,547 --> 00:39:31,109
Within three months of the explosion,
the two witnesses, they were dead.

533
00:39:31,618 --> 00:39:33,677
One killed himself in his car.

534
00:39:33,887 --> 00:39:36,720
The other fell down an open elevator shaft.

535
00:39:40,027 --> 00:39:41,995
Let's get this show on the road.

536
00:39:42,062 --> 00:39:44,792
This is not what we discussed.
There are too many--

537
00:39:44,865 --> 00:39:47,629
I promise we'll be out
before he blows his porch light.

538
00:39:47,701 --> 00:39:50,135
-I have a noon meeting.
-Five minutes.

539
00:39:50,204 --> 00:39:52,104
Everyone calm down, all right?

540
00:39:52,172 --> 00:39:55,505
I want you to ask this man
about the shootout in the harbor.

541
00:40:07,421 --> 00:40:10,288
-He says they were buying--
-Dope. We know.

542
00:40:16,029 --> 00:40:18,930
He doesn't know
what they were buying, but not dope.

543
00:40:19,633 --> 00:40:21,362
-People.
-What?

544
00:40:29,243 --> 00:40:31,040
He needs guarantees...

545
00:40:31,378 --> 00:40:35,314
-What is he talking about, guarantees?
-He says his life is in danger.

546
00:40:35,682 --> 00:40:37,445
He saw the Devil.

547
00:40:37,885 --> 00:40:39,477
Looked him in the eye.

548
00:40:39,553 --> 00:40:42,147
-I'm on my way.
-No, wait a minute.

549
00:40:42,222 --> 00:40:44,713
Ask him to tell him what he told me...

550
00:40:45,559 --> 00:40:47,254
...about the Devil.

551
00:40:47,628 --> 00:40:49,255
Who's the Devil?

552
00:40:54,468 --> 00:40:55,867
Keyser Soze.

553
00:41:00,841 --> 00:41:02,172
Keyser Soze?

554
00:41:02,276 --> 00:41:05,074
He was in the harbor, killing many men.

555
00:41:05,846 --> 00:41:07,609
He saw Keyser Soze?

556
00:41:13,954 --> 00:41:16,445
-He saw his face.
-All right.

557
00:41:16,790 --> 00:41:19,486
Tell him to tell her what he looks like.

558
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:21,384
Describe him.

559
00:41:27,834 --> 00:41:30,428
<i>Six weeks ago,</i>
<i>I get an anonymous phone call...</i>

560
00:41:30,504 --> 00:41:34,531
<i>...telling me I can find Keaton</i>
<i>eating at Mondino's, and there he is.</i>

561
00:41:35,342 --> 00:41:38,334
Because he never profited
from his alleged death...

562
00:41:38,545 --> 00:41:42,003
...and we convicted someone else
of the murder we tried to pin on him...

563
00:41:42,215 --> 00:41:44,012
...we had to let him go.

564
00:41:44,618 --> 00:41:47,883
He was dead just long enough
for the murder rap to blow over.

565
00:41:48,021 --> 00:41:49,682
And then he had lunch.

566
00:41:50,123 --> 00:41:52,057
I don't know about that.

567
00:41:52,292 --> 00:41:55,819
I don't think you do,
but you say you saw Keaton die.

568
00:41:56,530 --> 00:41:59,624
I think you're covering his ass,
and he's still out there.

569
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:02,032
I think he's behind
that circus at the harbor.

570
00:42:02,102 --> 00:42:05,629
My bet is he's using you because
you're stupid and think he's your friend.

571
00:42:05,706 --> 00:42:08,004
You tell me he's dead, so be it.

572
00:42:08,942 --> 00:42:11,206
I wanna be sure
before I go back to New York.

573
00:42:11,278 --> 00:42:14,213
He wasn't behind anything.
It was the lawyer.

574
00:42:14,748 --> 00:42:16,147
What lawyer?

575
00:42:17,017 --> 00:42:18,041
What lawyer?

576
00:42:18,118 --> 00:42:20,848
Back when I was in
that barbershop quartet--

577
00:42:20,921 --> 00:42:23,355
You don't think I know you held out
on the DA?

578
00:42:23,557 --> 00:42:25,081
What did you leave out?

579
00:42:25,158 --> 00:42:27,422
I could be on the phone
to Ruby in 10 minutes.

580
00:42:27,494 --> 00:42:30,156
-The DA gave me immunity.
-Not from me.

581
00:42:30,297 --> 00:42:32,765
You get no immunity from me,
you piece of shit.

582
00:42:32,833 --> 00:42:36,325
Every criminal I have put in prison,
every cop that owes me a favor...

583
00:42:36,503 --> 00:42:39,028
...every creep and scumbag
that walks the street...

584
00:42:39,106 --> 00:42:41,802
...will know the name of Verbal Kint.
You talk to me...

585
00:42:41,875 --> 00:42:44,366
...or that precious immunity
they grant you...

586
00:42:44,444 --> 00:42:48,744
...won't be worth the paper the contract
put out on your life is printed on.

587
00:42:50,851 --> 00:42:52,580
There was a lawyer.

588
00:42:53,887 --> 00:42:55,218
Kobayashi.

589
00:42:56,289 --> 00:43:00,658
-Is he the one that killed Keaton?
-No, but I'm sure Keaton is dead.

590
00:43:01,728 --> 00:43:03,059
Convince me.

591
00:43:03,797 --> 00:43:05,992
Tell me every last detail.

592
00:43:25,352 --> 00:43:28,788
<i>We arrived in Los Angeles</i>
<i>and met McManus' fence, Redfoot.</i>

593
00:43:29,756 --> 00:43:33,385
<i>He had a good reputation.</i>
<i>Seemed like a good guy.</i>

594
00:43:33,627 --> 00:43:36,619
<i>-Still, we should have known better.</i>
-How you doing?

595
00:43:36,697 --> 00:43:39,723
-Good. You?
-Not bad. Can't complain.

596
00:43:40,667 --> 00:43:42,567
How's it going, Fenster?

597
00:43:43,437 --> 00:43:45,564
Don't need to open it, right?

598
00:43:51,445 --> 00:43:53,174
You must be Keaton.

599
00:43:54,214 --> 00:43:56,011
Redfoot, Dean Keaton.

600
00:43:56,283 --> 00:44:00,276
-Todd Hockney and Verbal Kint.
-Verbal, the man with the plan.

601
00:44:01,121 --> 00:44:02,645
You interested in more work?

602
00:44:03,557 --> 00:44:06,492
-We're always looking for extra work.
-We're on vacation.

603
00:44:08,061 --> 00:44:09,494
That's too bad.

604
00:44:09,863 --> 00:44:12,058
I got a ton of work and no good people.

605
00:44:12,499 --> 00:44:14,433
-Not like you guys.
-What's the job?

606
00:44:14,835 --> 00:44:17,565
There's this jeweler
out of Texas named Saul.

607
00:44:17,637 --> 00:44:19,730
He rents a suite in some downtown hotel.

608
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:23,441
He does free appraisals.
Sometimes he buys, sometimes he doesn't.

609
00:44:23,777 --> 00:44:26,302
The word is,
he carries around a lot of cash.

610
00:44:27,114 --> 00:44:31,107
So I figure, I keep the merchandise,
you keep the green.

611
00:44:31,585 --> 00:44:33,917
-Simple.
-What about security?

612
00:44:33,987 --> 00:44:37,320
A couple of bodyguards.
Nothing you couldn't handle.

613
00:44:37,524 --> 00:44:39,355
Give me time to check it out?

614
00:44:39,726 --> 00:44:41,887
I expect nothing less from you, man.

615
00:44:43,230 --> 00:44:45,289
Good to see you. We'll call you.

616
00:44:45,365 --> 00:44:47,765
Enjoy LA. Get yourself laid.

617
00:44:53,173 --> 00:44:57,166
A friend in New York tells me
that you knew Spook Hollis.

618
00:44:58,145 --> 00:45:01,205
The way I hear it,
you did time with ol' Spook.

619
00:45:01,348 --> 00:45:03,145
A good man, wasn't he?

620
00:45:03,550 --> 00:45:05,575
I used to run dope for him.

621
00:45:06,219 --> 00:45:08,312
Too bad he got shivved.

622
00:45:10,357 --> 00:45:11,517
I shivved him.

623
00:45:14,094 --> 00:45:17,621
Better you hear it from me now
than from somebody else later.

624
00:45:19,099 --> 00:45:20,760
I appreciate that.

625
00:45:21,768 --> 00:45:23,633
But just out of curiosity...

626
00:45:24,204 --> 00:45:26,866
...was it business or personal?

627
00:45:29,309 --> 00:45:30,799
A bit of both.

628
00:45:32,345 --> 00:45:34,006
Like I said...

629
00:45:34,381 --> 00:45:37,248
...you give me a call if you're interested.

630
00:45:41,388 --> 00:45:43,117
Is there a problem?

631
00:45:44,825 --> 00:45:46,019
One job.

632
00:45:46,526 --> 00:45:48,153
That was the deal.

633
00:45:53,433 --> 00:45:54,661
One job?

634
00:45:57,704 --> 00:45:58,932
One job?

635
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:02,574
That's a good one.

636
00:46:04,845 --> 00:46:08,337
<i>Keaton fought it as best he could,</i>
<i>but a man can't change what he is.</i>

637
00:46:08,515 --> 00:46:11,609
<i>He can convince anyone he's someone else,</i>
<i>but never himself.</i>

638
00:46:11,685 --> 00:46:15,314
<i>It took one day with McManus nagging,</i>
<i>and we went back to work.</i>

639
00:46:30,036 --> 00:46:32,596
I get out of my car,
and the thing is wrecked.

640
00:46:32,672 --> 00:46:36,164
I look in the backseat of the other car,
and this woman's totally naked.

641
00:46:36,243 --> 00:46:39,337
-I'm laughin' so hard I can't breathe.
-Get in the car, Saul.

642
00:46:39,546 --> 00:46:42,208
-Freeze, motherfucker!
-Stay right there!

643
00:46:44,150 --> 00:46:46,084
There's a second one here, somewhere.

644
00:46:49,823 --> 00:46:53,054
Gimme the case. Give me the fuckin' case!

645
00:46:59,232 --> 00:47:02,668
Give me the fuckin' case.
I'm tellin' you for the last time.

646
00:47:02,903 --> 00:47:04,666
Give me the fuckin' case!

647
00:47:09,142 --> 00:47:11,667
-Come on!
-Don't move!

648
00:47:47,113 --> 00:47:48,740
Hand over the case.

649
00:47:49,883 --> 00:47:51,908
Hand over the fuckin' case.

650
00:48:15,909 --> 00:48:17,570
Come on, let's go!

651
00:48:18,211 --> 00:48:20,771
-Come on!
-Bad day. Fuck it.

652
00:48:21,514 --> 00:48:23,004
Let's go!

653
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:48,332
Fuck.

654
00:48:51,478 --> 00:48:55,175
-Looks like a lot of china to me.
-Shit.

655
00:49:00,487 --> 00:49:01,977
Guys, come on.

656
00:49:03,289 --> 00:49:05,780
-What are you doin'?
-I'm gonna kill him.

657
00:49:05,859 --> 00:49:07,986
We did it your way, now we'll do it mine.

658
00:49:08,061 --> 00:49:10,222
-You gonna kill him?
-I'll deal with him.

659
00:49:10,296 --> 00:49:13,163
-You'd better, or I'm gonna.
-Shut up.

660
00:49:20,540 --> 00:49:22,974
What am I supposed to do with that?

661
00:49:23,276 --> 00:49:26,404
Feed it to the gimp. Ease his pain.
I don't know what that is.

662
00:49:26,479 --> 00:49:28,504
-What do you mean?
-I don't know.

663
00:49:28,748 --> 00:49:30,875
I got thrown this job by some lawyer.

664
00:49:30,950 --> 00:49:31,939
Who?

665
00:49:32,185 --> 00:49:34,210
I don't know. Some limey.

666
00:49:34,387 --> 00:49:38,016
He's a middleman for somebody.
He doesn't say, I don't ask.

667
00:49:38,091 --> 00:49:40,389
-You're fuckin' full of shit!
-Fuck you.

668
00:49:40,460 --> 00:49:42,155
-Fuck you.
-Listen to me.

669
00:49:42,562 --> 00:49:44,553
We wanna meet him, okay?

670
00:49:44,898 --> 00:49:46,365
That's funny.

671
00:49:47,133 --> 00:49:50,728
He called me last night.
He says he wants to meet you guys.

672
00:49:51,404 --> 00:49:53,304
Okay, we'll meet him.

673
00:49:53,706 --> 00:49:55,606
-I'll call you.
-Good. Let's go.

674
00:49:55,675 --> 00:49:59,042
I don't like it. Wait a minute.
One more thing, tough guy:

675
00:49:59,579 --> 00:50:02,309
Any more surprises, and I'm gonna kill you.

676
00:50:03,716 --> 00:50:06,742
You're such a tough guy.
But do me a favor, all right?

677
00:50:06,820 --> 00:50:08,981
Get the fuck off my dick.

678
00:50:09,422 --> 00:50:10,821
No!

679
00:50:11,925 --> 00:50:13,756
Put a leash on that puppy.

680
00:50:15,862 --> 00:50:19,127
It's an awful shame
about Saul gettin' whacked.

681
00:50:19,799 --> 00:50:21,960
Cops'll be lookin' for the guys who did it.

682
00:50:23,036 --> 00:50:25,664
Sooner or later,
they're gonna come around askin' me.

683
00:50:28,108 --> 00:50:30,338
You have a sweet night, ladies.

684
00:50:34,147 --> 00:50:35,409
Fuck you.

685
00:50:41,788 --> 00:50:44,689
-So this lawyer--
-Kobayashi.

686
00:50:45,425 --> 00:50:47,757
-Came from Redfoot.
-Right.

687
00:50:48,161 --> 00:50:50,994
And why leave this out
when you talked to the DA?

688
00:50:51,097 --> 00:50:53,065
Dave, someone to see you.

689
00:50:58,471 --> 00:51:00,564
I've been looking all over for you.

690
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:04,269
You still after that coke that took a walk
out of that bloodbath yesterday?

691
00:51:04,344 --> 00:51:07,142
You can stop looking. There was no coke.

692
00:51:07,213 --> 00:51:10,876
I've been in LA County talking to a guy
they pulled out of a drainpipe...

693
00:51:10,950 --> 00:51:12,713
...yesterday after the shootout.

694
00:51:12,785 --> 00:51:14,980
He came to this morning,
he started talking.

695
00:51:15,054 --> 00:51:18,319
He's part of a Hungarian mob.
They dealt with gwats from Argentina.

696
00:51:18,391 --> 00:51:20,951
He says it was definitely not a dope deal.

697
00:51:21,027 --> 00:51:24,326
-But there were--
-We know. But he says no on the dope.

698
00:51:24,397 --> 00:51:27,924
This Hungarian tells me they were
pulling stumps for Turkey the next day.

699
00:51:28,001 --> 00:51:31,596
They had no time for that kind of product,
and no means to move it.

700
00:51:31,671 --> 00:51:33,662
-What's the money for?
-He didn't know.

701
00:51:34,007 --> 00:51:36,999
No one doing the deal knew
except for a few key people.

702
00:51:37,076 --> 00:51:39,374
They were all very hush about it, he says.

703
00:51:39,546 --> 00:51:43,778
-Whatever it was, it was very sensitive.
-I don't get it.

704
00:51:43,850 --> 00:51:46,114
You got the cripple in there
from New York?

705
00:51:46,186 --> 00:51:47,778
Did he mention Keyser Soze?

706
00:51:48,021 --> 00:51:49,386
Who?

707
00:51:49,923 --> 00:51:51,823
Just bear with me here.

708
00:51:53,259 --> 00:51:56,023
-Who's Keyser Soze?
-Fuck!

709
00:51:57,063 --> 00:52:00,260
We've been goin' over this
for an hour and a half.

710
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:04,602
What we need to do is find Redfoot
and get the hell out of here now.

711
00:52:04,671 --> 00:52:06,639
What we need to do is think.

712
00:52:06,940 --> 00:52:08,305
Think back.

713
00:52:09,442 --> 00:52:12,206
Somebody with power...

714
00:52:12,745 --> 00:52:15,908
...somebody capable of tracking us
from New York to LA.

715
00:52:15,982 --> 00:52:19,076
-What the hell are we doing here?
-We're waiting.

716
00:52:19,652 --> 00:52:23,520
-Sit down.
-No. I'm hot, and I'm fuckin' bored.

717
00:52:23,590 --> 00:52:25,387
Mr. Hockney, do stay.

718
00:52:26,125 --> 00:52:27,490
Mr. Keaton.

719
00:52:27,894 --> 00:52:30,192
Mr. Fenster I recognize
from his mug shots...

720
00:52:30,263 --> 00:52:32,094
...as well as Mr. McManus.

721
00:52:32,165 --> 00:52:37,159
I can only assume that you are Mr. Kint,
the gentleman who disposed of Saul Berg.

722
00:52:37,237 --> 00:52:40,934
My employer sends his gratitude,
a most unexpected benefit.

723
00:52:42,175 --> 00:52:43,836
I am Mr. Kobayashi.

724
00:52:44,043 --> 00:52:48,742
I have been asked by my employer
to bring a proposal to you gentlemen.

725
00:52:48,815 --> 00:52:51,909
-What do you want?
-My employer requires your services.

726
00:52:54,087 --> 00:52:57,614
One job, one day's work. Very dangerous.

727
00:52:57,824 --> 00:53:01,282
He does not expect all of you to live.
But those of you who do...

728
00:53:01,494 --> 00:53:05,487
...will have $91 million to divide
between you in any way you see fit.

729
00:53:05,565 --> 00:53:07,157
Who's your boss?

730
00:53:09,402 --> 00:53:11,029
I work for Keyser Soze.

731
00:53:22,382 --> 00:53:23,610
Who's Keyser Soze?

732
00:53:23,683 --> 00:53:26,083
Judging by the sudden change in mood...

733
00:53:26,219 --> 00:53:29,188
...I feel sure the rest
of your associates can tell you.

734
00:53:29,389 --> 00:53:32,256
I come with an offer
directly from Mr. Soze.

735
00:53:32,558 --> 00:53:36,255
-An order, actually.
-What do you mean, "an order"?

736
00:53:36,462 --> 00:53:41,422
In 1981, you participated in the hijacking
of a truck in Buffalo, New York.

737
00:53:42,035 --> 00:53:45,664
The cargo was raw steel,
steel which belonged to Mr. Soze...

738
00:53:45,738 --> 00:53:49,834
...and which was destined for Pakistan
to be used in a nuclear reactor.

739
00:53:50,109 --> 00:53:53,203
A most profitable violation
of UN Regulations.

740
00:53:53,279 --> 00:53:55,338
You had no way of knowing this...

741
00:53:55,415 --> 00:53:58,578
...because the fellow shipping the steel
was working for Soze...

742
00:53:58,651 --> 00:54:00,209
...without his knowledge.

743
00:54:00,553 --> 00:54:03,249
Earlier this year,
Mr. Fenster and Mr. McManus...

744
00:54:03,323 --> 00:54:07,089
...hijacked a two-prop cargo flight
out of Newark airport.

745
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:11,426
The plane was carrying gold and platinum
wiring also set for Pakistan.

746
00:54:12,031 --> 00:54:15,523
Two months ago,
Mr. Hockney stole a truck...

747
00:54:15,601 --> 00:54:18,126
...carrying gun parts through Queens.

748
00:54:18,204 --> 00:54:21,833
Gun parts which were set to be destroyed
by the state of New York.

749
00:54:22,041 --> 00:54:25,875
They were to be lost in a way station
and rerouted to Belfast.

750
00:54:25,945 --> 00:54:28,914
Again, Mr. Soze using pawns
who had no knowledge.

751
00:54:29,282 --> 00:54:31,443
Which brings us to Mr. Kint.

752
00:54:32,618 --> 00:54:35,178
Nine months ago, one of Mr. Soze's...

753
00:54:35,254 --> 00:54:39,816
...less than intelligent couriers was taken
in a complicated confidence scam...

754
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:41,993
...by a cripple.

755
00:54:42,362 --> 00:54:44,660
He was relieved of $62,000.

756
00:54:45,498 --> 00:54:48,331
Now, it has taken us
some time to find you.

757
00:54:48,801 --> 00:54:52,635
Our intention was to approach you
after your apprehension in New York.

758
00:54:52,839 --> 00:54:54,204
You set up the lineup.

759
00:54:54,273 --> 00:54:57,504
Yes. You were not to be released
until I had come to see you.

760
00:54:57,577 --> 00:55:00,410
It seems Mr. Keaton's attorney,
Miss Finneran...

761
00:55:00,780 --> 00:55:04,307
...was a little too effective
in expediting his release.

762
00:55:04,384 --> 00:55:06,579
Holding the rest of you
became a moot point.

763
00:55:06,886 --> 00:55:09,582
-What about Redfoot?
-Mr. Redfoot knew nothing.

764
00:55:09,756 --> 00:55:12,384
Mr. Soze rarely works
with the same people for long...

765
00:55:12,458 --> 00:55:15,222
...and they never know
who they're working for.

766
00:55:15,361 --> 00:55:18,262
One cannot be betrayed
if one has no people.

767
00:55:19,265 --> 00:55:21,290
So, why are you telling us?

768
00:55:21,701 --> 00:55:25,865
Because you have stolen from Mr. Soze,
Mr. Fenster.

769
00:55:26,105 --> 00:55:27,163
All of you.

770
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:30,903
That you did not know it
is the only reason you're still alive.

771
00:55:31,511 --> 00:55:35,174
He feels you owe him.
You will repay your debt.

772
00:55:35,615 --> 00:55:39,449
Fuck the debt, and fuck you.
How do we know you work for Soze?

773
00:55:39,919 --> 00:55:42,479
I don't think that is very relevant.

774
00:55:42,655 --> 00:55:45,818
All five of you are responsible
for the murder of Saul Berg...

775
00:55:45,892 --> 00:55:47,257
...and his bodyguards.

776
00:55:47,527 --> 00:55:50,087
Mr. Redfoot can testify
to your involvement.

777
00:55:50,163 --> 00:55:52,097
We can see to it that he will.

778
00:55:52,165 --> 00:55:55,225
-What's your point?
-The offer is this, gentlemen:

779
00:55:55,535 --> 00:55:57,696
Mr. Soze's primary interest...

780
00:55:58,070 --> 00:55:59,469
...is narcotics.

781
00:55:59,705 --> 00:56:02,333
He has been competing, shall we say...

782
00:56:02,408 --> 00:56:04,876
...with a group of Argentineans
for several years.

783
00:56:05,077 --> 00:56:07,910
Competing with Mr. Soze has taken its toll.

784
00:56:08,714 --> 00:56:11,308
These Argentineans
are negotiating the sale...

785
00:56:11,384 --> 00:56:15,252
...of $91 million in cocaine
in three days time.

786
00:56:15,555 --> 00:56:18,422
Needless to say,
this purchase will revitalize...

787
00:56:18,491 --> 00:56:21,255
...the diminishing strength
of their organization.

788
00:56:22,061 --> 00:56:25,326
Mr. Soze would like you to stop the deal.

789
00:56:26,532 --> 00:56:29,262
If you choose,
you may wait until after the buy.

790
00:56:29,335 --> 00:56:31,929
Whatever money changes hands is yours.

791
00:56:32,805 --> 00:56:37,606
Mr. Soze would like you to get to the boat
and destroy the cocaine onboard.

792
00:56:38,311 --> 00:56:42,270
And then you will be free
of your obligations to Mr. Soze.

793
00:56:44,584 --> 00:56:48,213
Give me one good reason
why I shouldn't kill you right now.

794
00:56:50,189 --> 00:56:52,783
A gift from Mr. Soze.

795
00:56:55,995 --> 00:56:57,758
Good day, gentlemen.

796
00:58:06,599 --> 00:58:10,194
They got my whole life in here,
everything I've done since I was 18.

797
00:58:10,469 --> 00:58:12,528
They fuckin' know everything.

798
00:58:12,705 --> 00:58:15,469
Everybody I've ever worked with
or did time with.

799
00:58:29,956 --> 00:58:30,980
No.

800
00:58:33,225 --> 00:58:35,489
-This isn't right.
-I don't know.

801
00:58:35,561 --> 00:58:38,655
Who's that guy who used
to talk about Soze in New York?

802
00:58:40,333 --> 00:58:44,497
-Bricks Marlin.
-He did jobs for him, indirect stuff.

803
00:58:45,071 --> 00:58:48,837
He said he always made five times
more money on it than the job was worth.

804
00:58:49,475 --> 00:58:51,170
This guy's a pipe dream.

805
00:58:51,243 --> 00:58:53,404
Kobayashi's using him
for window dressing.

806
00:58:53,946 --> 00:58:55,573
I don't know. This is bad.

807
00:58:56,082 --> 00:58:59,813
It's bullshit. This guy could be LAPD.
It's a fuckin' setup.

808
00:59:00,820 --> 00:59:03,687
The way I hear it,
Soze's some kind of butcher.

809
00:59:04,056 --> 00:59:08,288
-A peerless, psycho, fucked-up butcher.
-There is no Keyser Soze!

810
00:59:11,097 --> 00:59:12,655
Who is Keyser Soze?

811
00:59:13,833 --> 00:59:17,701
He's supposed to be Turkish.
Some say his father was German.

812
00:59:17,770 --> 00:59:19,795
Nobody ever believed he was real.

813
00:59:20,072 --> 00:59:23,200
Nobody knew him or saw anybody
that ever worked directly for him.

814
00:59:23,309 --> 00:59:26,335
To hear Kobayashi tell it,
anybody could have worked for Soze.

815
00:59:26,445 --> 00:59:29,505
You never knew. That was his power.

816
00:59:30,316 --> 00:59:33,217
The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled...

817
00:59:33,753 --> 00:59:36,654
...was convincing the world he didn't exist.

818
00:59:38,090 --> 00:59:40,786
One story the guys told me,
the story I believe...

819
00:59:40,860 --> 00:59:42,555
...was from his days in Turkey.

820
00:59:42,628 --> 00:59:45,563
There was a gang of Hungarians
that wanted their own mob.

821
00:59:45,631 --> 00:59:49,032
They realized that to be in power,
you didn't need guns...

822
00:59:49,101 --> 00:59:50,659
...or money or even numbers.

823
00:59:50,736 --> 00:59:54,194
You just needed the will
to do what the other guy wouldn't.

824
00:59:54,573 --> 00:59:57,974
After a while they come into power,
and then they come after Soze.

825
00:59:58,044 --> 01:00:01,343
He was small-time then.
Just running dope, they say.

826
01:00:03,616 --> 01:00:05,015
They come to his home...

827
01:00:05,418 --> 01:00:08,012
<i>...in the afternoon looking for his business.</i>

828
01:00:08,087 --> 01:00:12,353
<i>They find his wife and kids in the house,</i>
<i>and decide to wait for Soze.</i>

829
01:00:28,140 --> 01:00:32,406
<i>He comes home to find his wife raped</i>
<i>and children screaming.</i>

830
01:00:32,478 --> 01:00:35,879
<i>The Hungarians knew Soze was tough,</i>
<i>not to be trifled with.</i>

831
01:00:35,948 --> 01:00:37,677
They let him know they meant business.

832
01:00:38,784 --> 01:00:40,308
<i>No!</i>

833
01:00:43,155 --> 01:00:46,647
<i>They tell him they want his territory,</i>
<i>all his business.</i>

834
01:00:47,026 --> 01:00:50,587
Soze looks over the faces of his family.

835
01:00:52,465 --> 01:00:55,923
Then he showed these men
of will what will really was.

836
01:01:15,454 --> 01:01:18,423
<i>He tells them he would</i>
<i>rather see his family dead...</i>

837
01:01:18,824 --> 01:01:21,156
<i>...than live another day after this.</i>

838
01:01:22,628 --> 01:01:24,755
<i>He lets the last Hungarian go...</i>

839
01:01:24,997 --> 01:01:28,933
...waits until his family is in the ground,
and goes after the rest of the mob.

840
01:01:29,368 --> 01:01:31,996
He kills their kids, he kills their wives...

841
01:01:32,104 --> 01:01:34,334
...he kills their parents and their friends.

842
01:01:34,874 --> 01:01:37,104
<i>He burns down the houses they live in...</i>

843
01:01:38,210 --> 01:01:39,973
<i>...and the stores they work in.</i>

844
01:01:40,479 --> 01:01:44,006
<i>He kills people that owe them money.</i>
<i>And like that...</i>

845
01:01:45,351 --> 01:01:47,148
...he's gone, underground.

846
01:01:47,219 --> 01:01:49,813
Nobody's ever seen him since.
He becomes a myth.

847
01:01:49,889 --> 01:01:53,052
A spook story that criminals
tell their kids at night.

848
01:01:53,125 --> 01:01:56,219
"Rat on your pop,
and Keyser Soze will get you."

849
01:01:57,163 --> 01:01:59,154
No one ever really believes.

850
01:01:59,398 --> 01:02:01,423
Do you believe in him?

851
01:02:03,969 --> 01:02:05,698
Keaton always said:

852
01:02:05,905 --> 01:02:09,341
"I don't believe in God,
but I'm afraid of him."

853
01:02:11,310 --> 01:02:13,210
I believe in God.

854
01:02:13,579 --> 01:02:17,606
And the only thing that scares me
is Keyser Soze.

855
01:02:24,490 --> 01:02:26,515
You give any weight to this?

856
01:02:26,592 --> 01:02:29,060
I can introduce you to Dan Metzheiser
from Justice.

857
01:02:29,128 --> 01:02:32,791
He's got a file on Soze in DC.
It's been a hobby of his for a while.

858
01:02:32,898 --> 01:02:36,299
A lot of guys equate him to that reporter
on <i>The Incredible Hulk.</i>

859
01:02:41,307 --> 01:02:42,740
You've heard of him?

860
01:02:42,808 --> 01:02:44,673
Where? On the street?

861
01:02:44,743 --> 01:02:47,473
A few times. You know, outside stuff.

862
01:02:47,746 --> 01:02:51,773
Someone working for a guy who worked
for a guy who got money from Soze.

863
01:02:51,851 --> 01:02:53,443
Shit like that.

864
01:02:54,220 --> 01:02:56,518
It could be an old badge. A hex sign.

865
01:02:56,589 --> 01:02:59,683
Keep people from fucking with you
when a name meant something.

866
01:02:59,758 --> 01:03:01,692
-But you're here.
-Shit, yeah.

867
01:03:01,927 --> 01:03:06,523
This guy's trying to walk out of a hospital
because he's so afraid of Soze.

868
01:03:06,866 --> 01:03:08,925
I'll run it up the flagpole.

869
01:03:10,369 --> 01:03:12,894
I came clean. I told it like it happened.

870
01:03:12,972 --> 01:03:14,496
So what about how I got there?

871
01:03:14,573 --> 01:03:17,736
It's so full of holes, the DA would've
told me to forget amnesty.

872
01:03:17,810 --> 01:03:20,040
You got what you wanted out of me.
Big deal.

873
01:03:20,112 --> 01:03:22,945
-That's why you never told the DA?
-You tell me.

874
01:03:23,115 --> 01:03:26,380
If I told you the Loch Ness monster
hired me, what would you say?

875
01:03:26,452 --> 01:03:28,716
Turn state's evidence.
We'll put you on the stand.

876
01:03:28,787 --> 01:03:31,278
I've got immunity.
What can you possibly offer me?

877
01:03:31,390 --> 01:03:34,985
If there really is a Keyser Soze,
he's gonna come lookin' for you.

878
01:03:35,461 --> 01:03:36,792
Where's your head?

879
01:03:37,296 --> 01:03:39,127
Where do you think the pressure is?

880
01:03:39,198 --> 01:03:42,395
Keyser Soze, or whatever you call him,
knows where I am right now.

881
01:03:42,601 --> 01:03:46,628
He has the burner on your ass to let me go
so he can scoop me up 10 minutes later.

882
01:03:46,939 --> 01:03:48,964
Immunity was just a deal
with you assholes.

883
01:03:49,041 --> 01:03:50,941
I got a new problem when I post bail.

884
01:03:51,010 --> 01:03:53,501
Why play into his hands?
We can protect you.

885
01:03:54,546 --> 01:03:57,845
Thanks, Dave. Bang-up job so far.
Extortion, coercion.

886
01:03:57,917 --> 01:04:00,044
Pardon me if I ask you to kiss my pucker.

887
01:04:00,119 --> 01:04:03,486
The same fuckers that rounded us up
are now bailing me out?

888
01:04:03,555 --> 01:04:05,216
Fuck you.

889
01:04:07,126 --> 01:04:09,594
You think you can catch Keyser Soze?

890
01:04:09,662 --> 01:04:12,722
You think a guy like that
comes this close to getting caught...

891
01:04:12,798 --> 01:04:14,322
...and sticks his head out?

892
01:04:14,466 --> 01:04:17,230
If he comes up for anything,
it'll be to get rid of me.

893
01:04:17,569 --> 01:04:19,161
After that...

894
01:04:19,538 --> 01:04:22,564
...my guess is you'll never hear
from him again.

895
01:04:44,530 --> 01:04:46,225
What happened next?

896
01:04:46,498 --> 01:04:49,160
We woke up the next morning
and Fenster was gone.

897
01:04:49,234 --> 01:04:51,759
He couldn't handle the idea
of slumming for Soze.

898
01:04:52,004 --> 01:04:53,938
He left us a note wishing us good luck...

899
01:04:54,006 --> 01:04:56,770
...and took a chunk of the money
we'd scraped together.

900
01:04:56,875 --> 01:04:58,001
Then what?

901
01:04:58,243 --> 01:04:59,676
McManus was furious.

902
01:04:59,745 --> 01:05:03,977
He talked about tracking him down
and ripping his heart out. All sorts of shit.

903
01:05:04,750 --> 01:05:06,843
That night, we got the call.

904
01:05:07,252 --> 01:05:08,480
What call?

905
01:05:08,654 --> 01:05:11,088
Kobayashi told us where
we could find Fenster.

906
01:05:19,231 --> 01:05:21,529
Let's get the fuck out of here.

907
01:05:23,135 --> 01:05:24,659
We gotta bury him.

908
01:05:24,870 --> 01:05:26,201
With what?

909
01:05:26,638 --> 01:05:28,162
With our hands.

910
01:05:38,017 --> 01:05:39,416
This is nuts.

911
01:05:39,685 --> 01:05:41,676
It's dry fucking sand.

912
01:05:41,754 --> 01:05:45,212
When he rots the surfers
are gonna smell him a mile away.

913
01:05:45,324 --> 01:05:47,383
-Dig, you fuck.
-What are we gonna do?

914
01:05:47,459 --> 01:05:49,359
This fuckin' guy is gonna kill us.

915
01:05:49,428 --> 01:05:53,262
I don't know about you, peg leg,
but I can run. I got no problem with that.

916
01:05:54,166 --> 01:05:57,329
Kobayashi doesn't seem
to have a problem with it either.

917
01:05:58,303 --> 01:06:01,067
You run, and we're gonna be
diggin' a hole for you.

918
01:06:01,140 --> 01:06:02,607
You got that?

919
01:06:03,242 --> 01:06:06,609
This ain't my boy we're burying.
I don't owe anybody!

920
01:06:07,513 --> 01:06:11,176
-So fuck you.
-He was my partner for five years.

921
01:06:11,417 --> 01:06:14,853
We did more jobs and I saw more money
than you can ever count.

922
01:06:14,920 --> 01:06:16,319
So fuck you!

923
01:06:16,955 --> 01:06:20,015
-'Cause now it's payback!
-It's not payback!

924
01:06:22,995 --> 01:06:24,394
It's precaution.

925
01:06:24,797 --> 01:06:27,766
You want payback? You wanna run?
I don't care.

926
01:06:30,736 --> 01:06:32,966
I'm not doin' this for Fenster.

927
01:06:33,705 --> 01:06:35,696
I'm not doin' it for you.

928
01:06:37,176 --> 01:06:39,041
I'm doin' this for me.

929
01:06:40,846 --> 01:06:42,746
I'm gonna finish this thing.

930
01:06:43,449 --> 01:06:46,646
This Kobayashi bastard
is not gonna stand on me.

931
01:07:07,840 --> 01:07:10,001
After they killed Fenster,
nobody would run?

932
01:07:10,075 --> 01:07:14,011
-I wanted to. I thought we could make it.
-Why didn't you say anything?

933
01:07:14,079 --> 01:07:16,707
Believe me, I tried,
but Keaton wouldn't have it.

934
01:07:16,782 --> 01:07:18,807
It was too far-fetched for him.

935
01:07:18,884 --> 01:07:21,182
Keaton was a grounded guy. An ex-cop.

936
01:07:21,253 --> 01:07:24,188
To a cop, the explanation
is never that complicated.

937
01:07:24,256 --> 01:07:25,848
It's always simple.

938
01:07:25,958 --> 01:07:28,518
There's no mystery to the street,
no arch-criminal.

939
01:07:28,594 --> 01:07:32,360
You got a body and think
his brother did it, you're probably right.

940
01:07:32,431 --> 01:07:33,921
Nobody argued with Keaton.

941
01:07:33,999 --> 01:07:36,695
They just set their minds
to whacking Kobayashi.

942
01:07:46,612 --> 01:07:47,943
They're coming up.

943
01:07:49,715 --> 01:07:53,845
<i>-Did you hear me? He's coming up.</i>
-He's on his way down.

944
01:08:50,542 --> 01:08:51,907
Don't move.

945
01:08:52,611 --> 01:08:54,340
Press 20. Do it now.

946
01:09:14,666 --> 01:09:15,758
Move.

947
01:09:19,171 --> 01:09:22,038
-The answer is "no."
-Mr. Soze will be most--

948
01:09:22,107 --> 01:09:24,371
Listen, cocksucker,
there is no Keyser Soze.

949
01:09:24,443 --> 01:09:26,911
Mention his name again,
I'll kill you right now.

950
01:09:26,979 --> 01:09:30,847
A strange threat. I assume
you've come here to kill me anyway.

951
01:09:36,355 --> 01:09:38,755
We know that you can get to us...

952
01:09:39,625 --> 01:09:42,492
...but now you know
that we can get to you.

953
01:09:43,028 --> 01:09:46,054
I'm giving you one last
chance to call this off.

954
01:09:47,532 --> 01:09:49,523
My employer has made up his mind.

955
01:09:49,701 --> 01:09:52,761
-He does not change it.
-Neither do we.

956
01:09:52,904 --> 01:09:55,771
You got Fenster,
but you won't be able to get all of us.

957
01:09:55,841 --> 01:09:58,139
Not before one of us gets through to you.

958
01:09:58,243 --> 01:10:01,337
I believe you. I most sincerely do.

959
01:10:02,214 --> 01:10:04,944
You would not have been chosen
were you not so suitable.

960
01:10:05,017 --> 01:10:08,976
But I cannot make this decision.
Whatever you threaten me with is...

961
01:10:09,054 --> 01:10:11,887
...ludicrous in comparison
to what will be done to me...

962
01:10:11,957 --> 01:10:14,585
...if I do not carry out my orders in full.

963
01:10:22,034 --> 01:10:24,525
I'm the guy that's gonna get you.

964
01:10:26,204 --> 01:10:28,434
I just wanted you to know that.

965
01:10:29,374 --> 01:10:31,365
I'm so sorry.

966
01:10:31,877 --> 01:10:34,368
I implore you, believe me...

967
01:10:34,780 --> 01:10:36,771
...Mr. Soze is very real...

968
01:10:37,149 --> 01:10:39,640
-...and very determined.
-We'll see.

969
01:10:47,092 --> 01:10:50,459
Before you do me in...

970
01:10:50,962 --> 01:10:54,898
...you will let me finish my business
with Miss Finneran first, won't you?

971
01:10:59,871 --> 01:11:01,361
What did you say?

972
01:11:02,441 --> 01:11:04,033
Edie Finneran.

973
01:11:04,309 --> 01:11:06,334
She's upstairs in my office...

974
01:11:06,912 --> 01:11:09,107
...for an extradition deposition.

975
01:11:10,148 --> 01:11:12,981
I requested she be
put on the case personally.

976
01:11:13,051 --> 01:11:14,848
She flew in yesterday.

977
01:11:16,855 --> 01:11:18,186
No matter.

978
01:11:18,657 --> 01:11:20,522
Kill away.

979
01:11:25,364 --> 01:11:26,831
You're lying.

980
01:11:27,399 --> 01:11:28,491
Am I?

981
01:11:45,917 --> 01:11:49,546
Miss Finneran's escort
while she's here in Los Angeles.

982
01:11:49,621 --> 01:11:51,282
Never leaves her for a moment.

983
01:11:51,656 --> 01:11:54,181
I thought you'd be glad to know
she's in good hands.

984
01:11:58,964 --> 01:12:01,762
Get some rest.
The boat will be ready for you on Friday.

985
01:12:01,900 --> 01:12:04,460
If I see you or any
of your friends before then...

986
01:12:04,536 --> 01:12:09,371
...Miss Finneran will be the victim of
a most gruesome violation before she dies.

987
01:12:09,508 --> 01:12:11,942
As indeed will your father, Mr. Hockney...

988
01:12:12,544 --> 01:12:15,377
...and your Uncle Randall in Arizona,
Mr. Kint.

989
01:12:16,348 --> 01:12:19,715
I might only castrate
Mr. McManus' nephew, David.

990
01:12:22,721 --> 01:12:24,621
Do I make myself clear?

991
01:12:25,090 --> 01:12:27,558
We will take care
of the two bodies downstairs.

992
01:12:27,626 --> 01:12:29,856
We'll add them to the cost of Mr. Fenster.

993
01:12:30,729 --> 01:12:32,959
If you'll excuse me, gentlemen.

994
01:13:11,169 --> 01:13:13,262
It's a logistical nightmare.

995
01:13:13,405 --> 01:13:16,169
Close quarters. 10, maybe 20 men.

996
01:13:16,808 --> 01:13:19,743
There's no tellin'
how many more are gonna be below deck.

997
01:13:19,811 --> 01:13:22,075
Can we stealth these guys?

998
01:13:22,447 --> 01:13:25,644
With all that coke, they're gonna be ready.

999
01:13:26,485 --> 01:13:28,817
Which brings me to sunny point Number 2.

1000
01:13:29,488 --> 01:13:33,015
Even if one of us gets through
and jacks the boat, we still got nothin'.

1001
01:13:33,091 --> 01:13:34,820
What if we wait for the money?

1002
01:13:35,360 --> 01:13:37,157
Ten more men at least.

1003
01:13:37,929 --> 01:13:40,796
In my opinion, it can't be done.

1004
01:13:41,132 --> 01:13:43,396
Anyone who goes in
is not comin' out alive.

1005
01:13:43,468 --> 01:13:46,437
-I'm gonna wait for the money.
-Me, too.

1006
01:13:46,505 --> 01:13:49,997
-Did you hear what he just said?
-If I'm goin' in, I want a cut.

1007
01:13:50,075 --> 01:13:51,303
Me, too.

1008
01:13:52,811 --> 01:13:54,711
There's nothing that can't be done.

1009
01:13:57,849 --> 01:14:01,546
I just can't believe
we're gonna walk in to certain death.

1010
01:14:07,759 --> 01:14:10,387
The news said it's raining in New York.

1011
01:14:32,017 --> 01:14:33,644
What language is that?

1012
01:14:33,852 --> 01:14:37,015
I don't know. Russian, I think.

1013
01:14:38,957 --> 01:14:40,288
Hungarian?

1014
01:15:44,489 --> 01:15:46,923
The package has arrived, gentlemen.

1015
01:16:06,911 --> 01:16:08,037
You kids ready?

1016
01:16:08,947 --> 01:16:11,609
I would be if I didn't have to stop
and answer you.

1017
01:16:11,783 --> 01:16:13,080
I'm ready.

1018
01:16:13,284 --> 01:16:16,185
McManus, you better be set up
in 10 seconds.

1019
01:16:18,156 --> 01:16:19,248
I'm ready.

1020
01:16:20,959 --> 01:16:22,358
I want you to stay here.

1021
01:16:23,728 --> 01:16:25,093
I'm supposed to cover--

1022
01:16:25,163 --> 01:16:27,961
If we don't get out of this,
take the money and go.

1023
01:16:28,033 --> 01:16:29,125
I can't--

1024
01:16:29,200 --> 01:16:31,566
Find Edie.
Tell her everything that happened.

1025
01:16:31,636 --> 01:16:33,695
She knows people. She knows what to do.

1026
01:16:33,772 --> 01:16:36,798
If I don't get Kobayashi my way,
she'll get him her way.

1027
01:16:36,875 --> 01:16:39,366
-What if I--
-Just do what I say.

1028
01:16:40,011 --> 01:16:41,205
Please.

1029
01:16:44,549 --> 01:16:46,141
Tell her that...

1030
01:16:49,754 --> 01:16:51,381
Tell her I tried.

1031
01:17:04,569 --> 01:17:07,060
<i>McManus, he's on his way.</i>

1032
01:17:07,439 --> 01:17:08,770
I'm there.

1033
01:18:00,859 --> 01:18:04,625
One, two, three, four...

1034
01:18:05,263 --> 01:18:07,891
...five, six, seven...

1035
01:18:09,367 --> 01:18:10,994
Oswald was a fag.

1036
01:18:19,410 --> 01:18:20,434
Hi.

1037
01:18:21,179 --> 01:18:22,669
How you doin'?

1038
01:18:25,517 --> 01:18:27,849
Is there a problem?

1039
01:18:53,411 --> 01:18:54,400
Now.

1040
01:19:24,642 --> 01:19:27,839
<i>"Old McDonald had a farm</i>

1041
01:19:27,912 --> 01:19:30,472
<i>"Ee-aye, ee-aye, O</i>

1042
01:19:31,049 --> 01:19:35,349
"And on that farm, he shot some guys"

1043
01:20:09,053 --> 01:20:10,577
Elvis has left the building.

1044
01:21:21,826 --> 01:21:24,488
Hold fire. Hold fire. <i>Vamonos!</i>

1045
01:21:38,142 --> 01:21:39,336
Hello.

1046
01:22:33,731 --> 01:22:35,096
<i>Why didn't you run?</i>

1047
01:22:35,933 --> 01:22:37,298
I froze up.

1048
01:22:38,036 --> 01:22:41,403
I thought about Fenster
and how he looked when we buried him.

1049
01:22:41,472 --> 01:22:45,568
Then I thought about Keaton,
and it looked like he might pull it off.

1050
01:22:51,716 --> 01:22:53,911
A boy found a body on the beach today.

1051
01:22:53,985 --> 01:22:56,419
Thrown clear of the boat.
Shot twice in the head.

1052
01:22:56,487 --> 01:22:58,421
Two guys from the Bureau identified him.

1053
01:22:58,489 --> 01:23:00,650
-What else?
-His name was Arturo Márquez.

1054
01:23:00,725 --> 01:23:02,659
A petty smuggler from Argentina.

1055
01:23:02,727 --> 01:23:05,594
He was arrested last year in New York
for trafficking.

1056
01:23:05,663 --> 01:23:09,429
He escapes to California.
They pick him up in Long Beach.

1057
01:23:09,500 --> 01:23:12,901
They're setting up extradition,
he escapes again.

1058
01:23:12,970 --> 01:23:14,267
Now, get this.

1059
01:23:14,338 --> 01:23:17,967
Edie Finneran's brought in
to advise on the proceedings.

1060
01:23:18,042 --> 01:23:19,304
Kobayashi.

1061
01:23:19,377 --> 01:23:21,572
New York faxed me a copy
of his testimony.

1062
01:23:21,646 --> 01:23:24,206
-He was a rat.
-A big fucking rat.

1063
01:23:24,282 --> 01:23:27,046
Arturo was very opposed
to returning to prison.

1064
01:23:27,118 --> 01:23:31,020
So much so,
that he named close to 50 people.

1065
01:23:31,255 --> 01:23:33,587
Guess who he named in the finale.

1066
01:23:34,592 --> 01:23:35,991
Keyser Soze.

1067
01:23:36,327 --> 01:23:37,624
There's more.

1068
01:23:50,007 --> 01:23:54,307
I'll tell you what I know.
Stop me when this sounds familiar.

1069
01:23:55,680 --> 01:23:57,910
There was no dope on that boat.

1070
01:24:39,790 --> 01:24:41,121
You, stay quiet.

1071
01:24:41,359 --> 01:24:42,690
He's here.

1072
01:24:43,294 --> 01:24:47,060
I know he's here. That's him.
I'm telling you, that's him.

1073
01:24:47,265 --> 01:24:48,892
I know he's here!

1074
01:24:50,501 --> 01:24:53,561
-You can't understand. That's him.
-Shut up.

1075
01:24:53,638 --> 01:24:58,007
That's him. You hear me?
I'm telling you, it's Keyser Soze!

1076
01:26:56,294 --> 01:26:58,262
-Where's Hockney?
-I don't know.

1077
01:26:58,329 --> 01:26:59,921
There's no coke.

1078
01:27:00,164 --> 01:27:02,064
-What?
-You heard me, dumb fuck.

1079
01:27:02,133 --> 01:27:04,431
-There's no coke!
-What the fuck? No coke?

1080
01:27:04,502 --> 01:27:07,130
I've been up and down
in every fucking room.

1081
01:27:07,204 --> 01:27:09,502
-There's gotta be coke!
-There is nothing!

1082
01:27:09,573 --> 01:27:10,801
Nothing!

1083
01:27:11,309 --> 01:27:12,708
Don't you fuck with me.

1084
01:27:12,910 --> 01:27:16,744
There is no fucking coke!

1085
01:27:27,858 --> 01:27:29,450
I'm out of here.

1086
01:28:10,368 --> 01:28:12,131
I told them nothing.

1087
01:28:13,304 --> 01:28:14,464
I swear.

1088
01:28:15,206 --> 01:28:17,800
I told them nothing. Please.

1089
01:29:04,121 --> 01:29:06,988
What the fuck is goin' on?

1090
01:29:09,727 --> 01:29:11,490
The strangest thing.

1091
01:30:06,116 --> 01:30:09,381
That's what you said.
You saw a man in a suit with a slim build.

1092
01:30:09,453 --> 01:30:10,977
Wait a minute.

1093
01:30:11,055 --> 01:30:13,080
Are you saying you saw Keyser Soze?

1094
01:30:13,157 --> 01:30:16,649
-You said you didn't know who it was.
-I know there was dope on that boat.

1095
01:30:16,727 --> 01:30:18,251
-Stop stallin'.
-I'm not.

1096
01:30:18,329 --> 01:30:20,991
-You know what I'm getting at.
-Get out of my face.

1097
01:30:21,065 --> 01:30:23,898
I got immunity. I don't have to take this.

1098
01:30:23,968 --> 01:30:25,629
You know what I'm getting at.

1099
01:30:25,703 --> 01:30:28,228
-I don't know what you're talking about.
-The truth!

1100
01:30:28,305 --> 01:30:30,500
Try to tell me
you saw someone kill Keaton.

1101
01:30:30,574 --> 01:30:31,598
I did.

1102
01:30:31,675 --> 01:30:33,040
You're lying to me.

1103
01:30:33,110 --> 01:30:36,568
-You've known this whole time.
-I don't know what you're saying.

1104
01:30:36,647 --> 01:30:39,275
I did see Keaton get shot. I swear to you.

1105
01:30:39,383 --> 01:30:41,943
Why didn't you help him? You had a gun.

1106
01:30:42,086 --> 01:30:43,917
He was your friend.

1107
01:30:47,825 --> 01:30:49,622
Because I was afraid.

1108
01:30:51,862 --> 01:30:54,422
-Afraid.
-Afraid of what?

1109
01:30:55,599 --> 01:30:57,726
-Afraid of--
-I knew it was Keyser Soze.

1110
01:30:58,068 --> 01:31:01,970
It was Keyser Soze, I mean,
the Devil himself.

1111
01:31:03,274 --> 01:31:05,902
How do you shoot the Devil in the back?

1112
01:31:10,381 --> 01:31:12,008
What if you miss?

1113
01:31:17,121 --> 01:31:19,612
Let's get back to the pier.

1114
01:32:42,473 --> 01:32:45,874
-Arturo Márquez. Ever hear of him?
-What? No.

1115
01:32:46,010 --> 01:32:48,638
<i>He was a stool pigeon</i>
<i>for the Justice Department.</i>

1116
01:32:48,712 --> 01:32:51,078
He swore out a statement
to federal marshals...

1117
01:32:51,148 --> 01:32:54,515
...saying that he had seen
and could positively identify one...

1118
01:32:54,618 --> 01:32:55,880
<i>...Keyser Soze.</i>

1119
01:32:56,353 --> 01:32:58,116
It says right here in the report.

1120
01:32:58,188 --> 01:33:00,986
He had intimate knowledge
of his businesses, including...

1121
01:33:01,058 --> 01:33:04,221
...but not exclusive to,
drug trafficking and murder.

1122
01:33:04,294 --> 01:33:05,818
I never heard of him.

1123
01:33:05,896 --> 01:33:08,729
His own people were selling him
to a gang of Hungarians.

1124
01:33:08,799 --> 01:33:12,462
<i>Most likely the same Hungarians</i>
<i>that Soze all but wiped out back in Turkey.</i>

1125
01:33:12,803 --> 01:33:14,464
The money wasn't there for dope.

1126
01:33:14,538 --> 01:33:16,836
The Hungarians were going
to buy the one guy...

1127
01:33:16,907 --> 01:33:19,068
<i>...that could incriminate Keyser Soze.</i>

1128
01:33:19,476 --> 01:33:21,944
-I said I never heard of him.
-But Keaton did.

1129
01:33:22,012 --> 01:33:25,072
<i>Edie Finneran was Márquez's</i>
<i>extradition advisor.</i>

1130
01:33:25,149 --> 01:33:27,344
<i>She knew who he was and what he knew.</i>

1131
01:33:27,618 --> 01:33:30,815
There were no drugs on that boat.
It was a hit.

1132
01:33:31,088 --> 01:33:33,556
A suicide mission
to whack out the one guy...

1133
01:33:33,657 --> 01:33:35,716
<i>...that could finger Keyser Soze.</i>

1134
01:33:36,093 --> 01:33:37,958
<i>So Soze put some thieves to it...</i>

1135
01:33:38,362 --> 01:33:40,728
<i>...men he knew he could march</i>
<i>into certain death.</i>

1136
01:33:41,065 --> 01:33:43,590
You're saying Soze
sent us to kill someone?

1137
01:33:44,835 --> 01:33:47,861
<i>I'm saying Keaton did.</i>
<i>He left you behind for a reason.</i>

1138
01:33:47,938 --> 01:33:49,496
Just do what I tell you.

1139
01:33:49,573 --> 01:33:52,736
If you all knew that Soze
could find you anywhere...

1140
01:33:52,810 --> 01:33:54,801
...why did he give you the money to run?

1141
01:33:54,878 --> 01:33:58,177
-He could have used you on the boat.
-He wanted me to live.

1142
01:33:59,817 --> 01:34:02,445
<i>A one-time dirty cop without</i>
<i>a loyalty in the world...</i>

1143
01:34:02,519 --> 01:34:05,852
<i>...finds it in his heart</i>
<i>to save a worthless rat cripple?</i>

1144
01:34:05,923 --> 01:34:07,390
No, sir. Why?

1145
01:34:08,125 --> 01:34:09,149
Edie.

1146
01:34:09,226 --> 01:34:11,854
<i>I don't buy that reform story for a minute.</i>

1147
01:34:11,929 --> 01:34:13,260
Even if I did...

1148
01:34:13,330 --> 01:34:16,925
...I certainly don't believe
he would send you to protect her.

1149
01:34:17,267 --> 01:34:18,461
So why?

1150
01:34:20,904 --> 01:34:22,735
Because he was my friend.

1151
01:34:22,806 --> 01:34:26,742
No, he wasn't your friend.
Keaton didn't have friends.

1152
01:34:26,810 --> 01:34:28,277
What are you doing here?

1153
01:34:28,345 --> 01:34:31,075
He saved you
because he wanted it that way.

1154
01:34:31,148 --> 01:34:32,274
It was his will.

1155
01:34:32,883 --> 01:34:35,511
-Keaton was Keyser Soze.
-No.

1156
01:34:35,586 --> 01:34:39,147
<i>A man who could wrangle the wills</i>
<i>of men like Hockney and McManus.</i>

1157
01:34:39,223 --> 01:34:41,748
<i>A man who could engineer a police lineup...</i>

1158
01:34:41,825 --> 01:34:44,589
<i>...through all his years of contacts in NYPD.</i>

1159
01:34:44,661 --> 01:34:47,186
The kind of man
who could've killed Edie Finneran.

1160
01:34:52,202 --> 01:34:55,035
She was found yesterday
at a hotel in Pennsylvania...

1161
01:34:55,105 --> 01:34:56,970
...shot twice in the head.

1162
01:35:01,879 --> 01:35:04,712
What do you think about Keaton now?

1163
01:35:06,016 --> 01:35:07,005
Edie?

1164
01:35:07,084 --> 01:35:09,314
He used all of you to get him on that boat.

1165
01:35:09,386 --> 01:35:12,787
<i>He couldn't get on alone.</i>
<i>He had to pull the trigger himself...</i>

1166
01:35:12,856 --> 01:35:14,756
...to make sure he got his man...

1167
01:35:14,858 --> 01:35:16,917
...the one man that could identify him.

1168
01:35:18,028 --> 01:35:19,655
This is all bullshit.

1169
01:35:19,897 --> 01:35:21,865
You said you saw him die.

1170
01:35:24,268 --> 01:35:25,292
<i>Or did you?</i>

1171
01:35:25,469 --> 01:35:27,835
You had to hide
when you heard the police cars.

1172
01:35:27,905 --> 01:35:30,305
<i>You said you heard the shot</i>
<i>before the fire...</i>

1173
01:35:30,774 --> 01:35:32,799
...but you didn't see him die.

1174
01:35:33,076 --> 01:35:35,874
-I knew him. He would never--
-He programmed you.

1175
01:35:35,946 --> 01:35:38,574
<i>He programmed you to tell us</i>
<i>what he wanted you to.</i>

1176
01:35:38,649 --> 01:35:40,879
<i>He knew we were close.</i>
<i>You said it yourself.</i>

1177
01:35:40,951 --> 01:35:43,977
<i>Where was the political pressure</i>
<i>to protect you from?</i>

1178
01:35:44,254 --> 01:35:45,278
It was Keaton.

1179
01:35:45,355 --> 01:35:48,688
-Immunity was your reward.
-But why me?

1180
01:35:49,259 --> 01:35:51,352
Why not Fenster or McManus or Hockney?

1181
01:35:51,428 --> 01:35:54,124
Why me? I'm stupid.
I'm a cripple. Why me?

1182
01:35:54,198 --> 01:35:55,631
Because you're a cripple.

1183
01:35:56,166 --> 01:35:57,861
Because you're stupid.

1184
01:35:58,135 --> 01:36:00,069
Because you're weaker than them.

1185
01:36:04,374 --> 01:36:05,671
If he's dead...

1186
01:36:06,109 --> 01:36:10,011
If what you say is true,
then it won't matter.

1187
01:36:11,548 --> 01:36:14,415
It was his idea to hit the taxi service,
wasn't it?

1188
01:36:14,518 --> 01:36:17,681
-Come on, tell me the truth.
-It was all Keaton.

1189
01:36:18,989 --> 01:36:21,514
We followed him from the beginning.

1190
01:36:23,293 --> 01:36:24,453
I didn't know.

1191
01:36:24,962 --> 01:36:26,691
I saw him die.

1192
01:36:27,531 --> 01:36:30,523
I believe he's dead. Christ.

1193
01:36:31,768 --> 01:36:33,565
You're not safe on your own.

1194
01:36:37,674 --> 01:36:38,902
You think he's...

1195
01:36:39,209 --> 01:36:40,801
Keyser Soze?

1196
01:36:41,578 --> 01:36:43,205
I don't know.

1197
01:36:44,715 --> 01:36:48,674
Keyser Soze's a shield,
or like you said, a spook story.

1198
01:36:49,753 --> 01:36:53,382
But I know Keaton, and someone
is out there pulling strings for you.

1199
01:36:54,157 --> 01:36:57,593
-Stay here and let us protect you.
-I'm not bait. I post today.

1200
01:36:57,861 --> 01:36:59,294
You posted 20 minutes ago.

1201
01:36:59,863 --> 01:37:01,922
Capt. Leo wants you out of here.

1202
01:37:02,199 --> 01:37:05,168
-Unless you turn state's.
-I'll take my chances.

1203
01:37:05,502 --> 01:37:09,199
If someone wants to get you,
they're gonna get you out there.

1204
01:37:09,273 --> 01:37:12,674
Turn state's evidence.
You might never see trial.

1205
01:37:12,743 --> 01:37:13,937
Maybe so.

1206
01:37:15,512 --> 01:37:17,412
But I'm not a rat.

1207
01:37:34,197 --> 01:37:35,755
Fuckin' cops.

1208
01:38:00,223 --> 01:38:02,817
Excuse me, can I use your fax machine?

1209
01:38:06,797 --> 01:38:09,493
You'll have to sign for these, Mr. Kint.

1210
01:38:11,635 --> 01:38:13,227
One watch, gold.

1211
01:38:13,737 --> 01:38:15,830
One cigarette lighter, gold.

1212
01:38:16,707 --> 01:38:18,698
One pack of cigarettes. Thank you.

1213
01:38:19,309 --> 01:38:21,334
We still got nothing.

1214
01:38:21,645 --> 01:38:23,909
I know what I wanted to know
about Keaton.

1215
01:38:23,981 --> 01:38:25,608
Which is nothing.

1216
01:38:26,116 --> 01:38:29,677
No matter.
He'll have to know how close we came.

1217
01:38:30,187 --> 01:38:32,781
<i>Keyser Soze or no Keyser Soze...</i>

1218
01:38:33,156 --> 01:38:36,091
<i>...if Keaton is alive,</i>
<i>he's not comin' up again.</i>

1219
01:38:36,526 --> 01:38:38,323
<i>I'll find him.</i>

1220
01:38:38,795 --> 01:38:40,285
<i>Waste of time.</i>

1221
01:38:43,100 --> 01:38:45,432
<i>A rumor's not a rumor that doesn't die.</i>

1222
01:38:45,902 --> 01:38:47,028
<i>What?</i>

1223
01:38:48,138 --> 01:38:49,105
<i>Nothing.</i>

1224
01:38:51,141 --> 01:38:52,972
Man, you're a slob.

1225
01:38:53,043 --> 01:38:55,375
But it all has a system.

1226
01:38:56,246 --> 01:39:00,683
It all makes sense if you look at it right.
You gotta stand back from it.

1227
01:39:01,985 --> 01:39:05,079
You wanna see a real horror show?
See my garage.

1228
01:39:42,426 --> 01:39:44,485
<i>Convince me. Tell me every last...</i>

1229
01:39:44,561 --> 01:39:47,553
<i>When I was in that barbershop quartet</i>
<i>in Skokie, Illinois...</i>

1230
01:39:47,631 --> 01:39:51,192
<i>-Where's your head?</i>
<i>-We need to think, think back.</i>

1231
01:39:51,268 --> 01:39:52,895
<i>I'm sure you've heard tall tales.</i>

1232
01:39:52,969 --> 01:39:54,527
<i>-Bricks Marlin.</i>
<i>-This isn't right.</i>

1233
01:39:54,638 --> 01:39:57,038
<i>-I just wanna hear your story.</i>
<i>-It's all there.</i>

1234
01:39:57,107 --> 01:40:00,565
<i>-I'm tellin' it straight.</i>
<i>-Some guy in California called Redfoot.</i>

1235
01:40:00,644 --> 01:40:03,135
<i>-A gift from Mr. Soze.</i>
<i>-Talk to me.</i>

1236
01:40:03,213 --> 01:40:06,273
<i>-What about Redfoot?</i>
<i>-Mr. Redfoot knew nothing.</i>

1237
01:40:06,349 --> 01:40:09,318
<i>-Using pawns...</i>
<i>-A big fat guy. Like, orca fat.</i>

1238
01:40:09,386 --> 01:40:11,115
<i>There was a lawyer...</i>

1239
01:40:11,488 --> 01:40:12,887
<i>Kobayashi...</i>

1240
01:40:13,323 --> 01:40:16,451
<i>When I was picking beans</i>
<i>in Guatemala we made fresh coffee.</i>

1241
01:40:16,593 --> 01:40:19,528
<i>-I know you thought he was a good man.</i>
<i>-I know he was good.</i>

1242
01:40:21,932 --> 01:40:24,833
<i>-You tell me every last detail.</i>
<i>-The strangest thing.</i>

1243
01:40:24,901 --> 01:40:26,835
<i>How do you shoot the Devil in the back?</i>

1244
01:40:26,903 --> 01:40:30,134
<i>This guy is protected from up</i>
<i>on high by the Prince of...</i>

1245
01:40:30,240 --> 01:40:32,538
<i>What's your story, pretzel man?</i>

1246
01:40:32,609 --> 01:40:34,440
<i>-There was a lawyer.</i>
<i>-What lawyer?</i>

1247
01:40:34,511 --> 01:40:35,671
<i>I am Mr. Kobayashi.</i>

1248
01:40:35,745 --> 01:40:39,272
<i>-Kobayashi. Kobayashi.</i>
<i>-Tell me every last detail.</i>

1249
01:40:39,349 --> 01:40:42,580
<i>-I work for Keyser Soze.</i>
<i>-Convince me. Convince me.</i>

1250
01:40:57,868 --> 01:41:00,496
<i>Every creep and scumbag</i>
<i>that works the street...</i>

1251
01:41:00,570 --> 01:41:02,663
<i>...will know the name of Verbal Kint.</i>

1252
01:41:03,306 --> 01:41:04,796
The cripple, did you see him?

1253
01:41:04,875 --> 01:41:07,969
-The cripple! Which way did he go?
-He went out that way.

1254
01:41:08,044 --> 01:41:10,638
<i>I know you know something.</i>
<i>I know you're not telling...</i>

1255
01:41:10,714 --> 01:41:11,874
<i>I'm smarter than you...</i>

1256
01:41:11,948 --> 01:41:14,439
<i>...and I'm gonna find out</i>
<i>whether you like it or not.</i>

1257
01:41:14,518 --> 01:41:16,418
<i>To a cop, the explanation</i>
<i>is never complicated.</i>

1258
01:41:16,486 --> 01:41:18,078
<i>-It's always simple.</i>
<i>-The truth!</i>

1259
01:41:18,155 --> 01:41:21,090
<i>There's no arch-criminal behind it all.</i>

1260
01:41:21,158 --> 01:41:23,991
<i>Somebody with power,</i>
<i>somebody who is capable...</i>

1261
01:41:24,194 --> 01:41:25,786
<i>Keyser Soze!</i>

1262
01:41:26,563 --> 01:41:29,828
<i>You think a guy like that</i>
<i>gets this close to getting caught...</i>

1263
01:41:29,966 --> 01:41:31,934
<i>...and sticks his head out?</i>

1264
01:41:32,836 --> 01:41:35,862
<i>Because you're stupid.</i>
<i>Because you're a cripple.</i>

1265
01:41:35,939 --> 01:41:38,100
<i>What I wanna know is, who's the gimp?</i>

1266
01:41:38,175 --> 01:41:40,507
<i>You've known the whole fuckin' time.</i>

1267
01:41:40,577 --> 01:41:44,206
<i>If he comes up for anything</i>
<i>it'll be for me. I'm sure Keaton is dead.</i>

1268
01:41:44,281 --> 01:41:47,273
<i>I can't feel my legs, Keyser.</i>

1269
01:41:47,450 --> 01:41:49,850
<i>First thing I learned on the job.</i>
<i>You know what?</i>

1270
01:41:49,986 --> 01:41:53,444
<i>-How to spot a murderer.</i>
<i>-You got the cripple in there?</i>

1271
01:41:53,523 --> 01:41:56,287
<i>-Did he mention Keyser Soze?</i>
<i>-Who?</i>

1272
01:41:56,526 --> 01:41:58,050
<i>After that...</i>

1273
01:41:58,528 --> 01:42:01,554
<i>...my guess is you'll never hear</i>
<i>from him again.</i>

1274
01:42:22,085 --> 01:42:24,383
<i>The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled...</i>

1275
01:42:24,554 --> 01:42:27,284
<i>...was convincing the world he didn't exist.</i>

1276
01:42:29,159 --> 01:42:30,319
<i>And like that...</i>

1277
01:42:32,028 --> 01:42:33,359
<i>...he's gone.</i>
