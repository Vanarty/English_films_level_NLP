1
00:00:11,542 --> 00:00:14,500
BRIDGET: It all began
on New Year's Day...

2
00:00:14,542 --> 00:00:17,792
in my thirty-second year
of being single.

3
00:00:19,083 --> 00:00:21,458
Once again,
I found myself on my own...

4
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:25,708
and going to my mother's
annual turkey curry buffet.

5
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:27,333
Every year,
she tries to fix me up...

6
00:00:27,333 --> 00:00:29,708
with some bushy-haired,
middle-aged bore...

7
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:32,958
and I feared this year
would be no exception.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,833
There you are, dumpling.

9
00:00:34,875 --> 00:00:36,500
BRIDGET: My mum--

10
00:00:36,542 --> 00:00:37,917
a strange creature
from the time...

11
00:00:37,958 --> 00:00:39,292
when pickles on tooth picks...

12
00:00:39,333 --> 00:00:40,833
were still the height
of sophistication.

13
00:00:40,875 --> 00:00:42,500
Doilies, Pam?
Hello, Bridget.

14
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:44,667
Third drawer from the top, Una.

15
00:00:44,708 --> 00:00:46,667
Under the mini gherkins.

16
00:00:46,667 --> 00:00:50,875
By the way, the Darcys are here.
They brought Mark with them.

17
00:00:50,917 --> 00:00:52,500
BRIDGET: Ah, here we go.

18
00:00:52,542 --> 00:00:53,917
You remember Mark.

19
00:00:53,958 --> 00:00:55,625
You used to play
in his paddling pool.

20
00:00:55,667 --> 00:00:57,500
He's a barrister.
Very well off.

21
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,542
No, I don't remember.

22
00:00:59,583 --> 00:01:01,500
He's divorced, apparently.

23
00:01:01,542 --> 00:01:04,000
His wife was Japanese.
Very cruel race.

24
00:01:04,042 --> 00:01:05,708
Now, what are you
going to put on?

25
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:06,875
This.

26
00:01:06,917 --> 00:01:08,792
MUM: Oh, don't be silly,
Bridget.

27
00:01:08,833 --> 00:01:09,958
You'll never get a boyfriend...

28
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,958
if you look like you've
wandered out of Auschwitz.

29
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Now, run upstairs.

30
00:01:13,042 --> 00:01:15,000
I've laid out something
lovely on your bed.

31
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,083
Tsk. [Sighs]

32
00:01:18,292 --> 00:01:22,083
ANDY WILLIAMS SINGING:
You're just too good to be true

33
00:01:22,083 --> 00:01:24,500
Can't take my eyes off of you

34
00:01:24,542 --> 00:01:28,917
BRIDGET: Great.
I was wearing a carpet.

35
00:01:28,917 --> 00:01:30,750
UNCLE GEOFFREY: There she is.

36
00:01:30,792 --> 00:01:34,750
[Singing]
My little Bridget

37
00:01:34,792 --> 00:01:37,292
Hi, Uncle Geoffrey. Ha ha.

38
00:01:37,333 --> 00:01:38,625
-Hmm. Had a drink?
-No.

39
00:01:38,667 --> 00:01:39,917
No? Come on, then.

40
00:01:39,958 --> 00:01:41,667
BRIDGET:
Actually, not my uncle.

41
00:01:41,708 --> 00:01:43,458
Someone who insists
I call him uncle...

42
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,833
while he gropes my ass...

43
00:01:44,875 --> 00:01:47,958
and asks me the question
dreaded by all Singletons.

44
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,042
UNCLE GEOFFREY:
So...how's your love life?

45
00:01:51,083 --> 00:01:53,292
Super. Thanks, Uncle G.

46
00:01:53,333 --> 00:01:55,333
Still no fellow, then, eh?
I don't know.

47
00:01:55,333 --> 00:01:57,833
You career girls.
Can't put it off forever.

48
00:01:57,875 --> 00:01:59,750
UNA: Tick-tock, tick-tock.

49
00:01:59,792 --> 00:02:02,333
-Hello, Dad.
-Hello, darling.

50
00:02:02,375 --> 00:02:03,917
How's it going?

51
00:02:03,958 --> 00:02:05,542
Torture.

52
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:08,500
DAD: Your mother is trying to
fix you up with some divorcee.

53
00:02:08,542 --> 00:02:09,917
Uhh.

54
00:02:09,958 --> 00:02:13,042
Human-rights barrister.
Pretty nasty beast, apparently.

55
00:02:13,083 --> 00:02:16,500
BRIDGET: Hoo. Ding-dong.

56
00:02:16,542 --> 00:02:19,375
Maybe this time
Mum had got it right.

57
00:02:19,417 --> 00:02:22,750
Come on. Why don't we see
if Mark fancies a gherkin?

58
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:24,750
[Whispering] Good luck.

59
00:02:24,833 --> 00:02:26,333
Mark?

60
00:02:26,375 --> 00:02:29,042
BRIDGET: Maybe this was
the mysterious Mr. Right...

61
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:31,875
I'd been waiting
my whole life to meet.

62
00:02:31,917 --> 00:02:35,000
You remember Bridget.

63
00:02:35,042 --> 00:02:36,792
BRIDGET: Maybe not.

64
00:02:36,833 --> 00:02:38,583
She's used to
run around your lawn...

65
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:40,792
with no clothes on, remember?

66
00:02:40,833 --> 00:02:42,875
Uh, no, not as such.

67
00:02:44,583 --> 00:02:45,792
Come and look
at your gravy, Pam.

68
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:47,708
I think it's going
to need sieving.

69
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:48,917
Of course it doesn't
need sieving.

70
00:02:48,958 --> 00:02:50,708
Just stir it, Una.

71
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,958
Yes, of course.
I'll be right there.

72
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,958
Sorry. Lumpy gravy calls.

73
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,458
ANDY WILLIAMS SINGING:
Let me love you

74
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,917
[Sighs]

75
00:03:00,958 --> 00:03:03,917
-So...ha.
-So.

76
00:03:03,958 --> 00:03:07,083
You staying at your parents'
for New Year?

77
00:03:07,292 --> 00:03:08,667
-Yes.
-Mmm.

78
00:03:08,708 --> 00:03:10,083
-You?
-Oh, no, no, no.

79
00:03:10,292 --> 00:03:12,292
I was in London
at a party last night...

80
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:14,625
so I'm afraid
I'm a bit hung over.

81
00:03:14,667 --> 00:03:16,583
Wish I could be lying
with my head in the toilet...

82
00:03:16,625 --> 00:03:18,083
Like all normal people.

83
00:03:18,292 --> 00:03:20,042
[Chuckles, sighs]

84
00:03:20,083 --> 00:03:22,792
New Year's resolution--
drink less.

85
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:25,792
Oh, and quit smoking.
Mmm. Ha.

86
00:03:25,833 --> 00:03:28,500
-Oh.
-Oh. Ha.

87
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:30,917
And keep New Year's resolutions.

88
00:03:32,708 --> 00:03:35,667
Oh. And, uh...

89
00:03:35,667 --> 00:03:38,625
stop talking total nonsense
to strangers.

90
00:03:38,667 --> 00:03:40,958
In fact, stop talking,
full stop.

91
00:03:40,958 --> 00:03:44,542
Yes, well,
perhaps it's time to eat.

92
00:03:44,583 --> 00:03:45,542
Mmm.

93
00:03:45,583 --> 00:03:47,417
ANDY WILLIAMS SINGING:
I need you, baby

94
00:03:47,417 --> 00:03:48,375
MRS. DARCY: Apparently...

95
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:50,458
she lives just 'round
the corner from you.

96
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:53,042
Mother, I do not need
a blind date.

97
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:55,708
Particularly not with some
verbally incontinent spinster...

98
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,542
who smokes like a chimney,
drinks like a fish...

99
00:03:57,583 --> 00:03:59,625
and dresses like her mother.

100
00:04:02,292 --> 00:04:04,000
Yummy.

101
00:04:04,042 --> 00:04:05,917
Turkey curry.

102
00:04:05,917 --> 00:04:07,792
My favorite.

103
00:04:07,833 --> 00:04:10,667
BRIDGET: And that was it.
Right there.

104
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:13,625
Right there.
That was the moment.

105
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:19,042
I suddenly realized that unless
some thing changed soon...

106
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:21,708
I was going to live a life
where my major relationship...

107
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,625
was with a bottle of wine...

108
00:04:23,667 --> 00:04:26,833
and I'd finally die
fat and alone...

109
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:30,667
and be found three weeks later,
half-eaten by wild dogs.

110
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:33,333
Or I was about to
turn into Glenn Close...

111
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:34,792
in "Fatal Attraction."

112
00:04:36,417 --> 00:04:42,667
JAMIE O'NEAL SINGING:
All by myself

113
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:44,625
Don't wanna be

114
00:04:44,667 --> 00:04:49,000
All by myself

115
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Anymore

116
00:04:52,042 --> 00:04:54,625
VOICE: You have no messages.

117
00:05:18,417 --> 00:05:20,875
[Guitar plays]

118
00:05:20,917 --> 00:05:22,833
JAMIE O'NEAL SINGING:
When I was young

119
00:05:24,417 --> 00:05:27,792
I never needed anyone

120
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:34,083
And making' love
was just for fun

121
00:05:36,417 --> 00:05:38,958
Those days are gone

122
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:49,333
All by myself

123
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,083
Don't wanna be

124
00:05:52,292 --> 00:05:56,667
All by myself

125
00:05:56,708 --> 00:06:01,667
Anymore

126
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:05,583
Ohh

127
00:06:05,583 --> 00:06:07,583
Ohh

128
00:06:07,625 --> 00:06:08,708
Oh-oh-oh

129
00:06:17,917 --> 00:06:23,375
All by myself

130
00:06:24,417 --> 00:06:27,542
Don't wanna live...

131
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:29,625
BRIDGET: And so I made
a major decision.

132
00:06:29,667 --> 00:06:31,083
I had to make sure
that next year...

133
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:34,375
I wouldn't end up shit-faced
and listening to sad FM...

134
00:06:34,417 --> 00:06:36,833
easy-listening
for the over-thirties.

135
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:39,792
I decided to take
control of my life...

136
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:41,333
and start a diary...

137
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:44,042
to tell the truth
about Bridget Jones...

138
00:06:44,083 --> 00:06:45,417
the whole truth.

139
00:06:46,833 --> 00:06:48,958
Resolution number one--
ohh--

140
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:50,792
obviously will I lose
twenty pounds.

141
00:06:50,792 --> 00:06:51,708
Number two...

142
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:54,292
always put last night's panties
in the laundry basket.

143
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:55,708
Equally important...

144
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:58,375
will find nice sensible
boyfriend to go out with...

145
00:06:58,417 --> 00:07:00,417
and not continue to form
romantic attachments...

146
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:01,958
to any of the following...

147
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,375
alcoholics, workaholics,
commitment-phobics...

148
00:07:04,417 --> 00:07:05,750
peepingtoms, megalomaniacs...

149
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,667
emotional fuck wits,
or perverts.

150
00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:10,375
And especially
will not fantasize...

151
00:07:10,417 --> 00:07:14,958
about a particular person
who embodies all these things.

152
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,042
ARETHA FRANKLIN SINGING:
What you want

153
00:07:18,292 --> 00:07:20,375
Baby, I got

154
00:07:20,417 --> 00:07:22,083
What you need

155
00:07:22,292 --> 00:07:23,708
Do you know I got it?

156
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:27,083
BRIDGET: Unfortunately, he
just happens to be my boss...

157
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:29,375
Editor-in-Chief,
Daniel Cleaver.

158
00:07:29,417 --> 00:07:31,292
And for various
slightly unfair reasons...

159
00:07:31,292 --> 00:07:33,542
relating to this year's
Christmas party...

160
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:37,417
I suspect he does not
fantasize about me.

161
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:39,583
BRIDGET, DRUNK, SINGING:
Oh

162
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:43,750
Can't live

163
00:07:43,792 --> 00:07:47,458
If living is without you

164
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:52,042
I can't live

165
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:53,708
Can't give anymore

166
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:56,292
BRIDGET: Or maybe I'm wrong.

167
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:57,458
Huh?

168
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,958
[Indistinct chattering]

169
00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:07,917
BRIDGET: Ah.

170
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:10,292
Happy New Year, Mr. Fitzherbert.

171
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:11,667
Happy New Year, Brenda.

172
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:14,375
BRIDGET: Mr. Fitzherbert--
Tits Pervert, more like.

173
00:08:14,417 --> 00:08:16,292
Daniel's boss who stares
freely at my breasts...

174
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:19,083
with no idea who lam
or what I do.

175
00:08:19,292 --> 00:08:21,458
Morning. I need that
"Kafka's Motor bike" release...

176
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,667
by 11:00.

177
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:25,333
BRIDGET: Perpetua--
slightly senior...

178
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:27,375
and therefore thinks
she's in charge of me.

179
00:08:27,417 --> 00:08:28,583

I'm terribly sorry
to interrupt you...

358
00:16:15,833 --> 00:16:17,708
when you're having dinner.
It's just that--

359
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:20,583
Yes. Yes, it was me.

360
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:22,833
Yes. Nine years ago.

361
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:24,750
No current plans
to record anything else.

362
00:16:24,792 --> 00:16:26,042
Thank you so much.

363
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:27,875
Oh, it's just that, ahem...

364
00:16:27,917 --> 00:16:31,083
your--your chair
is on my wife's coat.

365
00:16:31,292 --> 00:16:32,750
[Laughter]

366
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,542
Your--your chair on the...

367
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:36,583
Of course it is.
Of course it is.

368
00:16:36,667 --> 00:16:38,292
MAN: Thank you so much.
Thank you.

369
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:40,708
BRIDGET: Hmm. Major dilemma.

370
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,500
If actually do,
by some terrible chance...

371
00:16:42,542 --> 00:16:44,042
end up inflagrante...

372
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:47,542
surely these would be most
attractive at crucial moment.

373
00:16:47,583 --> 00:16:49,750
However, chances of
reaching crucial moment...

374
00:16:49,792 --> 00:16:52,292
greatly increase
by wearing these.

375
00:16:52,292 --> 00:16:54,417
Scary stomach-holding-in
panties.

376
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:56,917
Very popular with grannies
the world over.

377
00:16:56,958 --> 00:17:00,583
Ha. Tricky. Very tricky.

378
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:02,625
["Peter Gunn" continues playing]

379
00:17:16,042 --> 00:17:17,583
BRIDGET:
Ladies and gentlemen...

380
00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:20,417
welcome to the launch
of "Kafka's Motor bike"...

381
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:21,833
"The Greatest Book
of Our Tiime"...

382
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:24,667
and here to introduce it
is Mr. Tits Pervert.

383
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:27,667
Ooh, Fitzherbert,
Fitzherbert, Fitzherbert.

384
00:17:28,833 --> 00:17:32,750
OK, circulate,
oozing intelligence.

385
00:17:32,792 --> 00:17:36,083
Ignore Daniel, and be fabulous
with everyone else.

386
00:17:36,292 --> 00:17:40,042
I am the intellectual equal
of everyone else here.

387
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:41,375
Ooh.

388
00:17:41,417 --> 00:17:43,625
It's like a whole theory
of short fiction...

389
00:17:43,667 --> 00:17:45,417
and of the novella, you know?

390
00:17:45,458 --> 00:17:46,667
And, of course, the problem...

391
00:17:46,708 --> 00:17:48,458
with Martin's definition
of the novella...

392
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,917
is that it really
only applies to him.

393
00:17:49,958 --> 00:17:52,792
[Laughter]

394
00:17:52,792 --> 00:17:54,875
MAN: That doesn't
sound like Martin.

395
00:17:54,917 --> 00:17:57,083
Not.
[Laughter]

396
00:17:57,292 --> 00:17:59,500
RUSHDIE: I could be wrong.
What do you think?

397
00:17:59,542 --> 00:18:03,917
Uh...do you know...

398
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:05,292

400
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:13,583
BRIDGET: Stay calm.
Can't get any worse.

401
00:18:16,542 --> 00:18:18,708
What are you doing here?

402
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:21,958
I've been asking myself
the same question.

403
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,042
I came with a colleague.

404
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:25,458
So how are you?

405
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,417
Well, apart from being
very disappointed...

406
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:30,542
not to see my favorite
reindeer jumper again...

407
00:18:30,583 --> 00:18:31,875
I'm well.

408
00:18:31,917 --> 00:18:33,667
Anyone going to introduce me?

409
00:18:33,708 --> 00:18:37,042
BRIDGET: Ah, introduce people
with thoughtful details.

410
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:38,750
Perpetua. Ha.

411
00:18:38,792 --> 00:18:40,583
This is Mark Darcy.

412
00:18:40,625 --> 00:18:42,708
Mark's a prematurely
middle-aged prick...

413
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:44,542
with a cruel-raced ex-wife.

414
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:45,917
Perpetua's  a fat-ass old bag...

415
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,875
who spends her time
bossing me around.

416
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:51,417
BRIDGET: Maybe not.

417
00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:52,750
Anyone going to introduce me?

418
00:18:52,792 --> 00:18:55,333
BRIDGET: Ah, Perpetua.

419
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:57,375
Uh, this is Mark Darcy.

420
00:18:57,417 --> 00:18:59,375
Mark's a top barrister.

421
00:18:59,417 --> 00:19:01,625
Oh, he comes from
Garth and Underwood.

422
00:19:01,667 --> 00:19:03,625
Perpetua is one
of my work colleagues.

423
00:19:03,667 --> 00:19:06,333
Why, Mark, I know you
by reputation, of course.

424
00:19:08,417 --> 00:19:09,917
Ah, Natasha.

425
00:19:09,958 --> 00:19:12,583
MARK: This is Bridget Jones.
Bridget, this is Natasha.

426
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:15,875
Natasha is a top attorney
and specializes in family law.

Bridget works in publishing...

428
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:19,750
and used to play naked
in my paddling pool.

429
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:23,542
-How odd.
-Ha ha.

430
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:25,458
Perpetua,
how's the house hunt going?

431
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,042
Disaster.

432
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:29,375
I oughtn't go into it with you.

433
00:19:29,417 --> 00:19:33,375
By the by, that man is gorgeous.

434
00:19:33,417 --> 00:19:34,792
Ah, yes, Mark.

435
00:19:34,833 --> 00:19:37,083
Just give me time.
Give me time.

that question.

You're looking very sexy, Jones.

I think I'm gonna have to
take you out to dinner now...

whether you like it or not, OK?

502

00:22:29,458 --> 00:22:31,667
So how do you feel about
this whole situation...

505
00:22:31,708 --> 00:22:33,542
in Chechnya?
Isn't it a nightmare?

506
00:22:33,583 --> 00:22:34,958
I couldn't give  a fuck, Jones.

507
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,875
Now, look, how do you
know Arsey Darcy?

508
00:22:38,917 --> 00:22:41,833
Apparently, I used
to run 'round naked...

509
00:22:41,875 --> 00:22:43,333
in his paddling pool.

510
00:22:43,375 --> 00:22:45,583
I bet you did, you dirty bitch.

511
00:22:45,625 --> 00:22:47,708
What about you?

512
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:49,375
Same. Yeah.

513
00:22:50,792 --> 00:22:54,042
No, no, I was best man
at his wedding.

514
00:22:54,083 --> 00:22:55,792
Um, knew him from Cambridge.

515
00:22:55,833 --> 00:22:57,042
He was a mate.

516
00:22:57,083 --> 00:22:59,083
And then what?

517
00:22:59,292 --> 00:23:02,500
And then, uh...nothing.

518
00:23:02,542 --> 00:23:05,042
You don't need to protect him.
He's no friend of mine.

519
00:23:05,083 --> 00:23:07,625
Well, um, then...

520
00:23:07,667 --> 00:23:09,833
many years later...

521
00:23:09,875 --> 00:23:13,375
I made the somewhat
catastrophic mistake...

522
00:23:13,417 --> 00:23:17,792
of introducing him
to my fiancee.

523
00:23:21,083 --> 00:23:22,708
And, um...

524
00:23:25,417 --> 00:23:29,333
I couldn't say, in all honesty,
I've ever quite forgiven him.

525
00:23:29,375 --> 00:23:31,750
God, so...

526
00:23:31,792 --> 00:23:34,792
he's a nasty bastard.

527
00:23:34,833 --> 00:23:36,583
And a dull bastard.

528
00:23:36,625 --> 00:23:38,833
Yes. Yes,
I think that's fair.

529
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:41,792
Anyway, fuck him. Listen,
don't let him ruin our evening.

530
00:23:41,792 --> 00:23:43,542
Why don't you have
some more wine...

531
00:23:43,583 --> 00:23:45,458
and tell me more about
practicing French-kissing...

532
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,625
with the other girls
at school...

533
00:23:46,667 --> 00:23:47,750
because that's
a very good story.

534
00:23:47,792 --> 00:23:50,500
-It wasn't French-kissing.
-Don't care. Make it up.

535
00:23:50,542 --> 00:23:52,458
That's an order, Jones.

536
00:23:52,458 --> 00:23:55,083
DANIEL: So, um, how about
a drink at my place?

537
00:23:55,292 --> 00:23:57,583
Totally innocent,
no funny business...

538
00:23:57,625 --> 00:23:59,583
just full sex.

539
00:24:00,667 --> 00:24:02,333
No, no, no.

540
00:24:02,375 --> 00:24:04,458
I should get a taxi.

541
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:07,667
But thank you
for the lovely dinner.

542
00:24:09,792 --> 00:24:12,875
It's a pleasure, Jones.

543
00:24:17,042 --> 00:24:19,917

Oh

546
00:24:26,625 --> 00:24:29,375
Ooh

547
00:24:29,417 --> 00:24:31,375
You're alone

548
00:24:31,417 --> 00:24:33,458
All the time

549
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:36,750
Does it ever puzzle you

550
00:24:36,792 --> 00:24:40,500
Have you asked why you seem

551
00:24:40,542 --> 00:24:42,875
To falling love

552
00:24:42,917 --> 00:24:45,042
And out again

553
00:24:45,083 --> 00:24:48,875
Do you really ever love

554
00:24:48,917 --> 00:24:50,542
Or just pretend

555
00:24:50,583 --> 00:24:52,083
Oh, baby

556
00:24:52,083 --> 00:24:55,083
Why fool yourself?

557
00:24:55,083 --> 00:24:58,750
Don't be afraid
to help yourself

558
00:24:58,792 --> 00:25:01,750
DANIEL: Now these are very
silly little boots, Jones.

559
00:25:01,792 --> 00:25:05,375
And this is a very
silly little dress.

560
00:25:05,417 --> 00:25:07,042
And, um...

561
00:25:07,083 --> 00:25:09,625
these are, uh...

562
00:25:09,625 --> 00:25:12,458

absolutely enormous panties.

563
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:14,083
Jesus. Fuck.

564
00:25:14,292 --> 00:25:16,292
No, no, don't apologize.
I like them.

565
00:25:16,333 --> 00:25:18,875
Hello, Mummy.

ROSEY SINGING: Love

567
00:25:22,292 --> 00:25:23,625
I'm sorry, I have to have
another look.

568
00:25:23,667 --> 00:25:25,458
-They're too good to be true.
-No.

569
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:26,625
There's nothing to be
embarrassed about.

570
00:25:26,625 --> 00:25:28,000
I'm wearing something
quite similar myself.

571
00:25:28,042 --> 00:25:31,625
-Here, I'll show you.
-No. No.

This time decide

573
00:25:33,292 --> 00:25:36,750
That you will open up

574
00:25:36,792 --> 00:25:39,292
Let it in

575
00:25:39,292 --> 00:25:42,083
There's no shame
in sharin' love

576
00:25:42,292 --> 00:25:45,875
You feel within

577
00:25:45,917 --> 00:25:48,583
So jump right in

578
00:25:48,625 --> 00:25:51,375
Head over heels

579
00:25:51,417 --> 00:25:53,417
And fall right in

580
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:54,708
Ha. Huh.

581
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:56,000
That was fantastic.

582
00:25:56,042 --> 00:25:58,042
Ohh. Mmm.

583
00:25:58,083 --> 00:25:59,625
Ay, ay.

584
00:25:59,625 --> 00:26:01,417
BRIDGET: Ohh. Daniel.

585
00:26:01,458 --> 00:26:02,583
Yeah?

586
00:26:02,625 --> 00:26:05,083
What happens at the office?

587
00:26:05,333 --> 00:26:07,083
Oh. Well,
I'm glad you asked that.

588
00:26:07,292 --> 00:26:09,917
You see,
it's a publishing house.

589
00:26:09,958 --> 00:26:11,958
So that means that people
write things for us...

590
00:26:11,958 --> 00:26:13,583
and then we print out
all the pages...

591
00:26:13,667 --> 00:26:14,875
and fasten them together...

592
00:26:14,917 --> 00:26:16,792
and make them into what
we call a book, Jones.

593
00:26:16,833 --> 00:26:21,333
No, do you think
people will notice?

594
00:26:21,375 --> 00:26:22,542
Notice what?

595
00:26:22,583 --> 00:26:25,708
Us. Working together,
sleeping together.

596
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:26,917
Hang on a minute, Jones.

597
00:26:26,958 --> 00:26:30,292
Just slow down.
It started on Tuesday...

598
00:26:30,333 --> 00:26:31,875
and now it's Thursday.

599
00:26:31,917 --> 00:26:33,917
It's not exactly...

600
00:26:33,958 --> 00:26:36,750
um, a long-term relationship,
is it?

601
00:26:36,792 --> 00:26:40,375
You're very bad.

with a very bad man
between her thighs.

609
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:58,708
Mum. Hi.

610
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:00,875
BRIDGET: It's the truth
universally acknowledged...

611
00:27:00,917 --> 00:27:04,542
that the moment one area
of your life starts going OK...

612
00:27:04,583 --> 00:27:08,667
another part of it falls
spectacularly to pieces.

613
00:27:08,708 --> 00:27:10,833
PAMELA: Ah, anyone else want
to have it off?

614
00:27:10,875 --> 00:27:12,708
Ha ha. Don't be shy, madame.

615
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:19,667
French. Have it oeuf. Ha ha!
With the wise crack egg peeler.

616
00:27:19,708 --> 00:27:22,583
Now, nice firm grip.

617
00:27:23,917 --> 00:27:26,750
Put it in the hole. And...

618
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:29,292
up, down, up, down.

619
00:27:29,333 --> 00:27:31,333
And off it comes in your hand.

620
00:27:32,625 --> 00:27:37,083
Oh! Mind the over-spray.
Sorry.

621
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:40,667
Darling, if I came in
with my knickers on my head...

622
00:27:40,708 --> 00:27:42,083
he wouldn't notice.

623
00:27:42,292 --> 00:27:44,625
I spent thirty-five years
cleaning his house...

624
00:27:44,667 --> 00:27:46,875
washing his clothes,
bringing up his children.

625
00:27:46,917 --> 00:27:49,083
I'm your child, too.

626
00:27:49,292 --> 00:27:50,583
To be honest, darling,
having children...

627
00:27:50,625 --> 00:27:52,417
isn't all it's cracked up to be.

628
00:27:52,458 --> 00:27:54,917
Given my chance again,
I'm not sure I'd have any.

629
00:27:54,958 --> 00:27:57,333
MUM: And now it's
the winter of my life...

630
00:27:57,375 --> 00:27:59,625
and I haven't actually
got anything of my own.

631
00:27:59,667 --> 00:28:03,375
I've got no power,
no real career...

632
00:28:03,417 --> 00:28:05,667
no--no sex life.

633
00:28:05,708 --> 00:28:07,500
I've got no life at all.

634
00:28:07,542 --> 00:28:09,542
I'm like the grasshopper
who sang all summer.

635
00:28:09,625 --> 00:28:11,333
I'm like Germaine sodding Geer.

637
00:28:12,833 --> 00:28:16,458
Well, anyway, I'm not having it.
And I've been talent spotted.

638
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:19,292
Julian thinks
I've got great potential.

639
00:28:19,333 --> 00:28:20,583
Who's Julian?

640
00:28:20,625 --> 00:28:22,542
From the Home Shopping Channel.

641

to have his colors done.

642
00:28:24,667 --> 00:28:26,375
Potential for what?

643
00:28:26,417 --> 00:28:28,833
As a demonstrator
on his cable show.

644
00:28:28,875 --> 00:28:30,542
You know, his assistant.

645
00:28:30,583 --> 00:28:32,875
Apparently, it's the highest-
rated show on the channel.

646
00:28:32,917 --> 00:28:34,292
Well, apart from the one...

647
00:28:34,333 --> 00:28:36,458

beat up their relatives.

this heart-shaped pendant.

659
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:15,708
One of my own personal
recommendations...

660
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:18,583
is this absolutely stunning...

661
00:29:18,625 --> 00:29:21,042

and earring set.

662
00:29:21,083 --> 00:29:26,708
JULIAN: The earrings measuring
just over a centimeter...

663
00:29:26,792 --> 00:29:30,917
in genuine diamond with
two pairs in lapis lazuli...

664

of those worn at Wimbledon...

the Duchess of Kent.

Has she actually moved out then?

670
00:29:47,792 --> 00:29:51,625
Apparently, she and this
tangerine-tinted buffoon...

671
00:29:51,667 --> 00:29:52,875
are suddenly an item.

taking Jaundice Julian...

could be a golden opportunity.

677
00:30:07,708 --> 00:30:11,792
If you spent the entire party
flirting with other women...

678
00:30:11,833 --> 00:30:13,792
it would drive Mum
wild with jealousy.

00:32:02,583 --> 00:32:04,000
What a gripping life
you do lead.

713
00:32:04,042 --> 00:32:07,042
DANIEL: I'll see you
upstairs in a second.

714
00:32:21,708 --> 00:32:23,542
Hmm. Well, the weakness
of their case...

715
00:32:23,583 --> 00:32:26,417
Lies in the deposition
they made on August 30.

716
00:32:26,417 --> 00:32:27,875
BRIDGET: Season of mist...

717
00:32:27,917 --> 00:32:29,750
and...

718
00:32:29,792 --> 00:32:31,583
mellow fruitlessness.

719
00:32:31,625 --> 00:32:33,458
Oh, fuck me, I love Keats.

720
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:34,917
Have you heard this one?

721
00:32:34,958 --> 00:32:37,042
"There was a young woman
from Ealing...

722
00:32:37,083 --> 00:32:39,958
"who had a peculiar feeling.

723
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,792
"She lay on her back
and opened her crack...

724
00:32:42,833 --> 00:32:44,542
"and pissed
all over the ceiling."

725
00:32:44,583 --> 00:32:45,708
[Bang]
Oh, bollocks.

726
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:47,750
BRIDGET: What've you done?

727
00:32:47,792 --> 00:32:50,667
-I'm boarding you, Bridge.
-Don't you dare!

728
00:32:50,708 --> 00:32:53,542
-I'm king of the world!
-No!

729
00:32:53,583 --> 00:32:55,792
Fuck me. Uhh!

730
00:32:55,833 --> 00:32:57,417
BRIDGET: Aah!

731
00:32:57,458 --> 00:33:00,292
[Bridget laughs]

732
00:33:00,333 --> 00:33:02,000
DANIEL: Oh, piss and bollocks.

733
00:33:02,042 --> 00:33:03,792
You stupid ass.

734
00:33:03,833 --> 00:33:06,333
[Laughing]

735
00:33:06,375 --> 00:33:08,042
Bollocks.

736
00:33:08,083 --> 00:33:09,625
All right.

737
00:33:09,667 --> 00:33:11,625
Aah! No!

738
00:33:11,625 --> 00:33:13,083
So childish.

739
00:33:13,292 --> 00:33:15,333
BRIDGET: Aah! No!

740
00:33:15,375 --> 00:33:16,792
Yes.

741
00:33:16,833 --> 00:33:19,000
DANIEL:
Hey, Darce, come on in!

742
00:33:19,042 --> 00:33:20,875
The water's lovely!

743
00:33:20,917 --> 00:33:22,542
Come on, you're working
too hard, mate.

744
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:23,750
Ha ha!

745
00:33:25,333 --> 00:33:28,292
-Daniel.
-Yes, Bridget?

746
00:33:28,292 --> 00:33:29,833
That thing you just did
is actually illegal...

747
00:33:29,875 --> 00:33:31,042
in several countries.

748
00:33:31,083 --> 00:33:32,917
Well, that is, of course,
the major reason...

749
00:33:32,958 --> 00:33:35,083
I'm so thrilled to be
living in Britain today.

750
00:33:35,292 --> 00:33:37,500
Yes. I can't understand...

751
00:33:37,542 --> 00:33:39,542
why the Prime Minister
doesn't mention it more...

752
00:33:39,625 --> 00:33:40,875
in his speeches.

753
00:33:40,917 --> 00:33:42,833
You should write
to him about it.

754
00:33:42,875 --> 00:33:44,083
BRIDGET: I intend to.

755
00:33:47,458 --> 00:33:49,583
Daniel.

756
00:33:49,625 --> 00:33:50,708
DANIEL: Bridget.

757
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:53,875
-Do you love me?
-Shut up, or I'll do it again.

758
00:33:56,042 --> 00:33:57,583
Do you love me?

759
00:33:57,625 --> 00:33:59,292
Right. You asked for it.

760
00:33:59,333 --> 00:34:02,583
DANIEL: And over we go.

761
00:34:02,625 --> 00:34:04,000
I'm going to give you
something to bite on.

762
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:05,667
Here.

763
00:34:05,708 --> 00:34:08,083
OK? Pop this in your mouth,
darling.

764
00:34:08,292 --> 00:34:10,417
[Bridget laughs]

765
00:34:10,458 --> 00:34:11,583
You're begging for it.

766
00:34:11,625 --> 00:34:12,833
[Bridget laughs]

767
00:34:12,875 --> 00:34:14,542
BRIDGET: Stop it.

768
00:34:14,583 --> 00:34:16,583
[Laughs]

769
00:34:17,583 --> 00:34:19,042
No, no.

770
00:34:26,792 --> 00:34:27,917
Hmm.

771
00:34:27,958 --> 00:34:33,417
I got to go back to town.
A meeting's come up.

772
00:34:33,417 --> 00:34:34,875
On a Sunday?

773
00:34:34,917 --> 00:34:36,375
DANIEL: No. The meeting's
first thing tomorrow.

774
00:34:36,417 --> 00:34:38,375
I've got to work
on some figures.

775
00:34:38,417 --> 00:34:43,292
We could just pop
into the party for a minute.

776
00:34:43,333 --> 00:34:44,875
DANIEL: Bridget,
I'm really sorry.

777
00:34:44,917 --> 00:34:48,458
I just can't do it.
I've got to head back.

778
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:49,958
Listen, Daniel...

779
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,417
if you've changed your mind,
you could just say so...

780
00:34:53,458 --> 00:34:55,792
because, honestly, I don't see
what could be so important.

781
00:34:55,833 --> 00:34:58,083
No, well, you wouldn't,
would you?

782
00:34:58,292 --> 00:34:59,958
Because you don't have
the faintest bloody idea...

783
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,292
of just how much trouble
the company's in.

784
00:35:03,333 --> 00:35:04,750
You swan in
in your short skirt...

785
00:35:04,792 --> 00:35:06,708
and your sexy
see-through blouse...

786
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:08,417
and fanny around
with press releases.

787
00:35:08,458 --> 00:35:09,875
You know, this is
the Americans flying in...

788
00:35:09,917 --> 00:35:11,583
because they're thinking
of shutting us down...

789
00:35:11,625 --> 00:35:12,958
for fuck's sake.

790
00:35:15,917 --> 00:35:17,583
Sorry.

791
00:35:19,583 --> 00:35:21,417
I'm sorry, Bridge.
I know I'm being a prat.

792
00:35:29,333 --> 00:35:31,333
Look, I'm going
to arrange a lovely car...

793
00:35:31,375 --> 00:35:33,042
to come and pick you up
and take you back...

794
00:35:33,083 --> 00:35:34,667
to London after the party, OK?

795
00:35:34,708 --> 00:35:36,792
If you have to travel alone,
travel in style.

796
00:35:36,833 --> 00:35:38,875
Hmm.

797
00:35:38,917 --> 00:35:40,875
And, um...

798
00:35:40,917 --> 00:35:42,792
I also think
it's very important...

799
00:35:42,833 --> 00:35:46,042
that you win
this costume competition.

800
00:35:47,667 --> 00:35:48,875
Good.

801
00:35:48,917 --> 00:35:50,500
Good start.

802
00:35:52,417 --> 00:35:55,000
Now, then, Miss Jones,
where does this go?

803
00:35:58,333 --> 00:36:01,292
BRIDGET:
Oh, well, here we go.

804
00:36:01,333 --> 00:36:02,833
Trying hard
to fight off a vision...

805
00:36:02,875 --> 00:36:06,042
of Mum and Auntie Una
in fishnet tights.

806
00:36:06,083 --> 00:36:09,625
Seems unnatural, wrong even,
for 60-year-olds to dress up...

807
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:12,500
as prostitutes and priests
on a Sunday afternoon.

808
00:36:12,542 --> 00:36:14,583
[People chattering]

809
00:36:14,625 --> 00:36:15,958
[Laughter]

810
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,667
JULIE LONDON SINGING:
Fly me to the moon

811
00:36:17,708 --> 00:36:19,708
BRIDGET: Oh, holy Jesus.

812
00:36:21,083 --> 00:36:22,750
Bridget.

813
00:36:22,792 --> 00:36:25,042
Where are all the other
Tarts and Vicars?

814
00:36:25,083 --> 00:36:26,583
UNA: Oh, dear.
Didn't Geoffrey call you?

815
00:36:26,583 --> 00:36:28,583
Didn't you telephone
Colin and Bridget?

816
00:36:28,625 --> 00:36:30,500
How's my little Bridget?

817
00:36:30,542 --> 00:36:31,667
GEOFFREY: Bop, bop.

818
00:36:31,708 --> 00:36:33,083
Oh.

819
00:36:33,083 --> 00:36:34,375
Geoffrey.

820
00:36:34,417 --> 00:36:36,417
So, where's this chap
of yours, then, eh?

821
00:36:36,458 --> 00:36:38,042
Ah, yes, well,
he had to work, so...

822
00:36:38,083 --> 00:36:40,042
Ha! A likely tale.

823
00:36:40,292 --> 00:36:41,875
Off they run. Whee!

824
00:36:41,917 --> 00:36:43,708
[Laughs weakly]

825
00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:45,500
JULIE LONDON SINGING:
You are all I long for

826
00:36:45,542 --> 00:36:48,750
Bizarre what some men
find attractive.

827
00:36:48,792 --> 00:36:50,875
Oh, God.

828
00:36:50,917 --> 00:36:53,417
MUM: Darling!
Geoffrey!

829
00:36:53,458 --> 00:36:55,042
What on earth are you wearing?

830
00:36:55,083 --> 00:36:57,042
You look like
a common prostitute.

831
00:36:57,083 --> 00:36:58,875
Yes, well, that was,
actually, the point.

832
00:36:58,917 --> 00:37:00,083
Say hi to Julian.

833
00:37:00,292 --> 00:37:02,333
Hello, Julian.

834
00:37:02,375 --> 00:37:03,542
My dear...

835
00:37:03,583 --> 00:37:05,667
you and your mother
could be sisters.

836
00:37:07,458 --> 00:37:09,042
JULIAN:
And what a lovely bracelet.

837
00:37:09,083 --> 00:37:10,792
It's what I call
an all-arounder--

838
00:37:10,833 --> 00:37:13,792
the sort of thing one can wear
with anything to any occasion.

839
00:37:13,833 --> 00:37:15,542
Oh.

840
00:37:15,583 --> 00:37:17,417
Have you spoken to my dad?

841
00:37:17,458 --> 00:37:20,042
Yes. He's behaving
most bizarrely.

842
00:37:20,083 --> 00:37:21,625
I think he was actually
trying to flirt...

843
00:37:21,667 --> 00:37:24,042
with Penny Husbands-Bosworth,
poor thing.

844
00:37:24,083 --> 00:37:25,542
She was very frightened.

845
00:37:25,583 --> 00:37:27,417
She's only just had
her ovaries done.

846
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:33,875
I don't know what
you ever saw in him.

847
00:37:33,917 --> 00:37:36,000
Shh. Bad man.
[Both laugh]

848
00:37:41,292 --> 00:37:42,500
[Breathes deeply]

849
00:37:42,542 --> 00:37:43,667
[Footsteps]

850
00:37:43,708 --> 00:37:45,500
Heh heh.

851
00:37:45,542 --> 00:37:47,542
Didn't tell you, either.

852
00:37:47,583 --> 00:37:50,417
[Laughs]

853
00:37:50,458 --> 00:37:52,708
No. I didn't spend as much
as Bernard, thank God.

854
00:37:57,625 --> 00:37:58,750
BRIDGET: Oh.

855
00:37:59,958 --> 00:38:01,417
I'm sorry, Dad.

856
00:38:01,417 --> 00:38:03,542
The way she looked at me.

857
00:38:04,625 --> 00:38:06,583
Well, she loves you, really.

858
00:38:06,583 --> 00:38:08,750
You love each other.

859
00:38:08,792 --> 00:38:10,083
This is only a temporary glitch.

860
00:38:10,292 --> 00:38:11,958
Is it?

861
00:38:11,958 --> 00:38:14,292
I don't know.

862
00:38:14,333 --> 00:38:16,333
DAD: I don't know.

863
00:38:19,625 --> 00:38:21,583
UNA: Ah, Bridget, there you are.

864
00:38:21,625 --> 00:38:22,875
Don't worry.
You're not the only one.

865
00:38:22,917 --> 00:38:25,542
This is Penny. Geoffrey didn't
get in touch with her, either.

866
00:38:25,583 --> 00:38:26,750
I'm sorry?

867
00:38:26,792 --> 00:38:28,625
I was just saying Geoffrey
didn't contact you, either...

868
00:38:28,667 --> 00:38:30,042
to tell you that
the Tarts and Vicars concept...

869
00:38:30,292 --> 00:38:31,542
had gone out of the window.

870
00:38:31,583 --> 00:38:33,458
Oh, yes, he did.

871
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:34,708
Oh, right.

872
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:36,417
Lovely dress.

873
00:38:36,458 --> 00:38:38,000
Very exotic.

874
00:38:41,583 --> 00:38:43,417
What a shame you couldn't
bring your boyfriend, Bridget.

875
00:38:43,458 --> 00:38:44,792
What's his name?
David? Darren?

876
00:38:44,833 --> 00:38:46,333
MARK: Daniel Cleaver.

877
00:38:46,375 --> 00:38:48,083
Oh. Is he a friend
of yours, Mark?

878
00:38:48,292 --> 00:38:49,542
Absolutely not.

879
00:38:49,583 --> 00:38:51,917
I hope he's good enough
for our little Bridget.

880
00:38:51,958 --> 00:38:55,000
I think I can say with
total confidence absolutely not.

881
00:38:55,042 --> 00:38:56,917
Well, I'm sure he'd say
the same about you...

882
00:38:56,958 --> 00:38:58,667
given your past behavior.

883
00:38:58,708 --> 00:39:00,042
Sorry?

884
00:39:00,083 --> 00:39:01,708
I think you know what I mean.

885
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:02,875
Mark.

886
00:39:17,625 --> 00:39:18,917
BRIDGET: Hmm.
Looks like Auntie Shirley...

887
00:39:18,958 --> 00:39:21,750
didn't get the message, either.

888
00:39:24,375 --> 00:39:26,333
[Doorbell rings]

889
00:39:29,917 --> 00:39:31,083
Hi.

890
00:39:31,292 --> 00:39:35,542
I really, really wanted
to see a friendly face.

891
00:39:35,583 --> 00:39:37,333
Oh, now, listen,
I'll tell you what.

892
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:40,292
I have an idea.
Let me finish this...

893
00:39:40,292 --> 00:39:41,833
while you go home,
have a long hot bath...

894
00:39:41,875 --> 00:39:45,458
and I'll call round,
and we'll have dinner later, OK?

[Door closes]

896
00:39:48,375 --> 00:39:50,042
Is there someone here?

897
00:39:50,083 --> 00:39:52,375
Not that I'm aware of.

898
00:39:52,417 --> 00:39:54,333
Unless that Bosnian family
has moved in again.

899
00:39:54,375 --> 00:39:55,542
Bastards.

900
00:40:07,667 --> 00:40:09,667
[Laughs] Oh.

901
00:40:09,708 --> 00:40:11,500
I'm sorry.

902
00:40:11,542 --> 00:40:12,792
Sorry.

903
00:40:15,417 --> 00:40:16,750
I'm going mad.

904
00:40:16,792 --> 00:40:19,000
Listen, I am feeling
really bad, actually.

905
00:40:19,042 --> 00:40:21,000
-I should've been there today.
-No, I'm sorry.

906
00:40:21,042 --> 00:40:22,375
No, no, I'm sorry...

907
00:40:22,417 --> 00:40:24,417
but at least I got
a hell of a lot of work done.

908
00:40:24,417 --> 00:40:26,417
Just give me one more hour, OK?

909
00:40:26,417 --> 00:40:28,042
Fine. That's fine.

910
00:40:28,083 --> 00:40:30,583
I will go home and de-bunny.

911
00:40:31,958 --> 00:40:33,458
Oh...

912
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:37,750
and you know last night
when I said that I loved you?

913
00:40:37,792 --> 00:40:39,000
Mm-hmm.

914
00:40:39,042 --> 00:40:40,583
I didn't mean it.

915
00:40:40,625 --> 00:40:41,625
I was being ironic.

916
00:40:41,667 --> 00:40:45,500
Oh, God, yeah,
I know, I know.

917
00:40:45,542 --> 00:40:46,917
All right.

918
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:51,500

the New York office.

Lara, this is Bridget.

924

DAN: This is totally insane.

929
00:42:34,292 --> 00:42:37,083
I'm 36 years old. It may be
my last chance to have a child.

well, you know...

947
00:43:51,042 --> 00:43:52,500
No. You'll have to fill me in.

948
00:43:52,583 --> 00:43:54,458
Well, the truth is...

949
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:57,000
the truth is, we're the same,
Bridge, you and me.

950
00:43:57,042 --> 00:43:59,000
You know? We're two people
of a certain age...

951
00:43:59,083 --> 00:44:02,708
looking for the moment to commit
and finding it really hard.

952
00:44:02,750 --> 00:44:04,000
And I just think
that in the end...

953
00:44:04,042 --> 00:44:07,333
it's got to be
something extraordinary...

954
00:44:07,375 --> 00:44:09,875
something which makes us
go that extra mile.

955
00:44:09,917 --> 00:44:11,083
And I think...

956
00:44:11,292 --> 00:44:13,417
Lara and--

957
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:15,708
I don't know,
being American and all...

958
00:44:15,750 --> 00:44:20,750
it has something to do
with confidence and being so...

00:44:20,792 --> 00:44:24,333
well, young, you know?

960
00:44:28,417 --> 00:44:31,667

No. I got to know her
pretty well...

when we were
in the New York office together.

Oh.

Oh, fuck.

There's no easy way
to say this, but, um...

972
00:45:00,917 --> 00:45:05,833
I wanted you to be the first
to know that...

At times like this...

continuing with one's life
seems impossible...

and eating the entire
contents of one's fridge...

977
00:45:35,750 --> 00:45:38,042
seems inevitable.

I have two choices--

00:45:40,708 --> 00:45:44,667
to give up and accept permanent
state of spinster hood...

980
00:45:44,708 --> 00:45:48,625
and eventual eating by dogs...
or not.

to start straight away.

in about, ooh, three minutes...

right there, Miss Jones.

I'm sorry to inform you...

1046
00:48:28,708 --> 00:48:30,667
but I think you'll find
that by contract...

1047
00:48:30,750 --> 00:48:32,792
you're expected to give
at least six weeks notice.

in so much trouble and all...

I'm going to fire

1056

you should know that, um...

here for a talented person.

1060

will you, Simon? Thanks.

Right-o, boss man.

1062
00:49:04,875 --> 00:49:09,083
Lots of prospects
for a person who...

1063
00:49:09,292 --> 00:49:11,000
you know, perhaps
for personal reasons...

1064
00:49:11,042 --> 00:49:14,917

overlooked professionally.

00:49:14,958 --> 00:49:17,917
Thank you, Daniel.
That is very good to know...

1066
00:49:17,958 --> 00:49:19,333
but if staying here...

1067
00:49:19,375 --> 00:49:21,833
means working
within 10 yards of you...

1068
00:49:21,875 --> 00:49:25,750
frankly, I'd rather have a job
wiping Saddam Hussein's ass.

00:49:34,708 --> 00:49:36,583
Sock it to me,
sock it to me

1075
00:49:36,583 --> 00:49:38,542
Well, bye, everyone.

1076
00:49:38,583 --> 00:49:40,542
[Singing]
Just a little bit

1077
00:49:40,583 --> 00:49:41,833
Just a little bit

1078
00:49:41,875 --> 00:49:43,417
I get tired

1079
00:49:43,458 --> 00:49:45,042
But keep on tryin'

1080
00:49:45,083 --> 00:49:46,750

[Song stops]

1082
00:49:47,917 --> 00:49:49,375
Oh, just sod off.

1083
00:49:49,542 --> 00:49:51,833
HOST: Hello and welcome
to "Sit Up, Britain."

1084
00:49:51,875 --> 00:49:55,083
OK, everybody,
it is bonfire night...

1085
00:49:55,292 --> 00:49:56,917
and we are on fire.

1086
00:49:56,958 --> 00:49:58,875
RICHARD: We have live
fire station feeds...

1087
00:49:58,917 --> 00:50:03,375
from Newcastle, Swansea,
Sheffield, and Lewisham...

1088
00:50:03,417 --> 00:50:05,083
just poised for tragedy.

1089
00:50:05,292 --> 00:50:07,500
Bridget Jones, where are you?

1090
00:50:09,417 --> 00:50:10,583
I'm here, Richard.

1091
00:50:10,625 --> 00:50:12,750
Put on some more makeup.
I want you on-camera.

1092
00:50:12,792 --> 00:50:13,917
But--

1093
00:50:13,958 --> 00:50:15,917
RICHARD:
I'm thinking...mini skirt.

1094
00:50:15,917 --> 00:50:17,542
I'm thinking fireman's helmet.

1095
00:50:17,583 --> 00:50:19,417
I want you pointing a hose.

1096
00:50:19,458 --> 00:50:20,792
I want you
sliding down the pole...

1097
00:50:20,792 --> 00:50:22,333
and then go straight
into the interview.

1098
00:50:22,375 --> 00:50:24,625
Great.

1099
00:50:24,667 --> 00:50:26,375
I'll do it.

1100
00:50:28,625 --> 00:50:30,083
No problem. Fine. Right.

1101
00:50:30,083 --> 00:50:31,625
So, you drop into shot...

1102
00:50:31,625 --> 00:50:32,792
and then interview
Chief Fireman Bevan.

1103
00:50:32,833 --> 00:50:34,625
Yep, yep, yep.

1104
00:50:34,667 --> 00:50:35,917
Go, go. Go, go. Go!

1105
00:50:35,958 --> 00:50:37,542
Go?

1106
00:50:37,625 --> 00:50:40,792
NEVILLE: Oh, no.
We're going to Newcastle first.

1107
00:50:40,833 --> 00:50:42,417
Stop!

1108
00:50:42,458 --> 00:50:43,792
Climb back up.

1109
00:50:43,833 --> 00:50:45,000
On you in thirty seconds.

1110
00:50:45,042 --> 00:50:46,750
OK.

[Grunts]

1112
00:50:48,958 --> 00:50:51,542
RICHARD: Neville, what
the fuck is going on?

1113
00:50:51,583 --> 00:50:52,833
She's supposed to be
sliding down the pole...

1114
00:50:52,875 --> 00:50:55,042
-not climbing up it.
-Go, go, go, go, go!

1115
00:50:55,083 --> 00:50:56,542
Oh, OK.

1116
00:50:57,583 --> 00:50:59,750
-Oh!
-Oh, Jesus Christ.

1117
00:50:59,792 --> 00:51:02,333
Uhh! Uhh!

1118
00:51:02,375 --> 00:51:03,375
OK, we're out of time.
We're out of time.

1119
00:51:03,417 --> 00:51:04,833
RICHARD: Just wind 'erupt.

1120
00:51:04,833 --> 00:51:08,083
Well, that seems to be
about all we've got time for...

1121
00:51:08,292 --> 00:51:09,958
down here in Lewisham.

1122
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:13,792
Uh, Chief Officer Bevan,
thank you very much.

1123
00:51:13,833 --> 00:51:15,625
Excellent fire station.

1124
00:51:15,667 --> 00:51:17,583
BRIDGET: Uh, and now...

1125
00:51:17,625 --> 00:51:19,917
back to the studio.

1126
00:51:19,958 --> 00:51:21,583
BRIDGET: Whoo!

1127
00:51:21,625 --> 00:51:23,500
Whoo!

1128
00:51:23,542 --> 00:51:25,542
Whoo!

1129
00:51:25,583 --> 00:51:26,875
Whoo!

1130
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:29,583
BRIDGET: Excellent.
Am national laughing stock.

Am daughter of broken home...

1133
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:35,000
and rubbish
at everything and...

1134
00:51:35,083 --> 00:51:36,375
oh, God.

1135
00:51:36,417 --> 00:51:39,042
I'm having dinner
with Magda and Jeremy.

1136
00:51:39,083 --> 00:51:41,958
The only thing worse
than as mug married couple--

1137
00:51:41,958 --> 00:51:44,875
Lots of smug married couples.

1138
00:51:44,917 --> 00:51:47,542
Right, everyone.
This is Bridget.

1139
00:51:48,917 --> 00:51:50,542
Bridge, this is Hugo and Jane.

1140
00:51:50,583 --> 00:51:52,042
MAGDA: And, obviously,
you know, of course...

1141
00:51:52,083 --> 00:51:53,500
Cosmo and Woney.

1142
00:51:53,542 --> 00:51:54,750
-Hi, Bridge.
-Hi, Bridge.

Joanne and Paul...

1146
00:51:59,792 --> 00:52:01,625
and Jeremy's partners
from chambers.

1147
00:52:01,625 --> 00:52:04,458
This is Natasha Glenville
and Mark Darcy.

1148
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:05,625
Hi, there.

1149
00:52:05,667 --> 00:52:07,042
Hello.

1150
00:52:07,083 --> 00:52:09,042
Not in your bunny girl
outfit today?

1151
00:52:09,083 --> 00:52:10,417
BRIDGET: No.

1152
00:52:10,458 --> 00:52:15,083
We bunnies only wear our tails
on very special occasions.

1153
00:52:15,083 --> 00:52:17,417
-Sit yourself down.
-Right.

1154
00:52:20,542 --> 00:52:23,583
Hey, Bridge,
how's your love life?

1155
00:52:23,667 --> 00:52:25,000
Oh...

1156
00:52:25,042 --> 00:52:27,458
COSMO: Still going out
with that publishing chap pie?

1157
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:29,792
Uh, no, no.

1158
00:52:29,833 --> 00:52:31,083
Terribly brill.

1159
00:52:31,292 --> 00:52:33,958
COSMO: Never dip your nib
in the office ink.

1160
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,500
Right.

1161
00:52:35,542 --> 00:52:36,750
COSMO: You really
ought to hurry up...

1162
00:52:36,792 --> 00:52:39,375
and get sprugged up,
you know, old girl?

1163
00:52:39,417 --> 00:52:42,917
Time's a-running out.
Tick-tock.

1164
00:52:42,958 --> 00:52:44,958
Yes, yes.

1165
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,417
Uh, tell me, is it
one in four marriages...

1166
00:52:47,458 --> 00:52:49,417
that ends in divorce now
or one in three?

1167
00:52:49,458 --> 00:52:50,750
One in three.

1168
00:52:51,750 --> 00:52:53,042
COSMO: Seriously, though.

1169
00:52:53,083 --> 00:52:56,917
Offices full of single girls
in their thirties--

1170
00:52:56,958 --> 00:52:58,875
fine physical specimens...

1171
00:52:58,917 --> 00:53:02,042
but they just can't seem
to hold down a chap.

1172
00:53:02,083 --> 00:53:03,583
WONEY: Yes. Why is it...

1173
00:53:03,583 --> 00:53:05,583
there are so many unmarried
women in their thirties...

1174
00:53:05,583 --> 00:53:06,708
these days, Bridget?

1175

1177
00:53:12,750 --> 00:53:14,917
Oh, I don't know.

1178
00:53:14,958 --> 00:53:18,000
Suppose it doesn't help
that underneath our clothes...

1179
00:53:18,042 --> 00:53:20,583
our entire bodies
are covered in scales.

1180
00:53:20,625 --> 00:53:23,500
[Faint laughter]

1181
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:34,667
MARK: I very much enjoyed...

1182
00:53:34,708 --> 00:53:38,625
your Lewis ham fire report,
by the way.

1183
00:53:38,625 --> 00:53:40,083
Thank you.

1184
00:53:43,667 --> 00:53:45,708
I just...

1185
00:53:45,750 --> 00:53:47,375
yeah, well.

1186
00:53:48,917 --> 00:53:50,375
So.

1187
00:53:51,417 --> 00:53:52,708
It didn't work out
with Daniel Cleaver?

1188
00:53:52,750 --> 00:53:54,875
No, it didn't.

1189
00:53:56,417 --> 00:53:57,708
I'm delighted to hear it.

1190
00:53:59,292 --> 00:54:02,458
Look, are you and Cosmo
in this together?

1191
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:04,042
I mean, you seem
to go out of your way...

1192
00:54:04,083 --> 00:54:06,375
to try to make me feel
like a complete idiot...

1193
00:54:06,417 --> 00:54:11,292
every time I see you,
and you really needn't bother.

1194
00:54:11,333 --> 00:54:15,667
I already feel like an idiot
most of the time anyway--

1195
00:54:15,708 --> 00:54:18,458
with or without
a fireman's pole.

1196

BRIDGET: That'll be my taxi.

1198
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:24,917
Good night.

1199
00:54:24,958 --> 00:54:26,417
Look, um...

1200
00:54:26,417 --> 00:54:29,417
I'm sorry if I've been...

1201
00:54:29,458 --> 00:54:30,708
What?

1202
00:54:30,750 --> 00:54:34,625
I don't think
you're an idiot at all.

1203
00:54:34,667 --> 00:54:38,667
I mean, there are elements
of the ridiculous about you.

1204
00:54:38,708 --> 00:54:40,958
Your mother's
pretty interesting.

1205
00:54:40,958 --> 00:54:42,292
And you really are...

1206
00:54:42,333 --> 00:54:44,333
an appallingly bad
public speaker.

1207
00:54:44,375 --> 00:54:46,625
And you tend to let
whatever's in your head...

1208
00:54:46,667 --> 00:54:47,917
come out of your mouth...

1209
00:54:47,958 --> 00:54:51,333
without much consideration
of the consequences.

1210
00:54:51,375 --> 00:54:54,667
I realize that when I met you
at the turkey curry buffet...

1211
00:54:54,708 --> 00:54:59,542
that I was unforgivably rude
and wearing a reindeer jumper...

1212
00:54:59,583 --> 00:55:01,833
that my mother had
given me the day before.

1213
00:55:03,083 --> 00:55:05,083
But the thing is, um...

1214
00:55:05,292 --> 00:55:09,833
what I'm trying to say
very inarticulately is...

1215
00:55:11,292 --> 00:55:12,917
that, um...

1216
00:55:12,958 --> 00:55:14,667
infact...

1217
00:55:14,708 --> 00:55:17,917
perhaps, despite appearances...

1218
00:55:17,958 --> 00:55:20,708
I like you very much.

1219
00:55:20,750 --> 00:55:23,958
Ah. Apart from the smoking
and the drinking...

1220
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,833
and the vulgar mother
and the verbal diarrhea.

1221
00:55:26,875 --> 00:55:30,792
No. I like you very much--
just as you are.

1222
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:36,083
Mark, we really are making
progress on the case in here.

1223
00:55:36,292 --> 00:55:40,083
NATASHA: Jeremy's had
the most brilliant idea.

1224
00:55:40,292 --> 00:55:41,875
[Snaps fingers]
MARK: Right.

1225
00:55:41,917 --> 00:55:43,333
Right.

1226
00:55:45,917 --> 00:55:48,083
I must go, because...

1227
00:55:49,833 --> 00:55:51,833
well...

1228
00:55:51,917 --> 00:55:53,583

Just as you are?

Not thinner? Not cleverer?

1233
00:56:10,083 --> 00:56:13,333
Not with slightly bigger breasts
and a slightly smaller nose?

from an extradition order...

1597
01:12:19,958 --> 01:12:24,333
That's not a good enough offer
for me.

I'm not willing
to gamble my whole life...

VAN MORRISON SINGING:
Keep me satisfied

1955
01:30:37,708 --> 01:30:41,542
Someone exactly like you

1956
01:30:45,042 --> 01:30:48,042
Someone exactly like you

1957
01:30:51,875 --> 01:30:55,500
Someone exactly like you

1958
01:30:59,917 --> 01:31:02,375
The best is yet to come

1959
01:31:05,542 --> 01:31:08,542
The best is yet to come

ROBBIE WILLIAMS SINGING:
Have you met Miss Jones?

1962
01:31:26,500 --> 01:31:30,042
Someone  said as we shook hands

1963
01:31:30,083 --> 01:31:33,958
She was just Miss Jones

1964
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,708
To me

1965
01:31:38,542 --> 01:31:41,500
And now I've met Miss Jones

1966
01:31:42,792 --> 01:31:45,542
And we'll keep on meeting

1967
01:31:45,542 --> 01:31:48,542
Till we're done

1968
01:31:48,542 --> 01:31:50,917
Miss Jones and I

1969
01:31:53,375 --> 01:31:54,708
Whoa, fellas

1970
01:32:23,542 --> 01:32:25,667
And all at once

1971
01:32:25,750 --> 01:32:27,583
I lost my breath

1972
01:32:27,625 --> 01:32:29,667
And all at once

1973
01:32:29,708 --> 01:32:31,667
Was scared to death

1974
01:32:31,708 --> 01:32:33,458
And all at once

1975
01:32:33,500 --> 01:32:36,583
I owned the earth

1976
01:32:36,625 --> 01:32:38,792
And sky

1977
01:32:40,875 --> 01:32:44,958
Now I've met Miss Jones

1978
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:48,083
And we'll keep on meeting

1979
01:32:48,292 --> 01:32:51,292
Till we're done

1980
01:32:51,333 --> 01:32:53,708
Miss Jones and I

1981

How!

SHELBY LYNNE SINGING:I didn't
mean to hurt your feelings

1985
01:33:15,792 --> 01:33:18,042
It was so careless of me

1986
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:23,333
I guess I've gone and done it

1987
01:33:23,375 --> 01:33:25,583
It's just a matter of time

1988
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:28,750
Nothing I can do

1989
01:33:28,792 --> 01:33:31,042
But tell you I'm sorry

1990
01:33:31,042 --> 01:33:38,083
And that's the hardest part
of all

1991
01:33:38,292 --> 01:33:45,833
'Cause your love's
the killin' kind

1992
01:33:45,875 --> 01:33:53,833
Your love's the killin' kind

1993
01:33:53,875 --> 01:33:56,000
Yeah

1994
01:33:56,042 --> 01:33:58,583
I'd rather walk on glass

1995
01:33:58,625 --> 01:34:03,792
Than see tear drops in your eyes

1996
01:34:03,833 --> 01:34:06,083
And I'd fall to pieces

1997
01:34:06,292 --> 01:34:08,000
Just to hold you

1998
01:34:08,042 --> 01:34:10,667
The best thing in my life

1999
01:34:10,708 --> 01:34:14,833
And it's just luck
I get to love you

2000
01:34:14,875 --> 01:34:18,500
You're the one thing
that's right

2001
01:34:18,542 --> 01:34:22,500
You're the light
in my hell's darkness

2002
01:34:22,542 --> 01:34:30,000
'Cause your love's
the killin' kind

2003

Your love's the killin' kind

2004
01:34:37,958 --> 01:34:39,667
Oh, yeah

2005
01:34:41,458 --> 01:34:43,500
I just might cry now

2006
01:34:43,542 --> 01:34:45,000
Lie

2007
01:34:45,042 --> 01:34:47,292
Lay down and die now

2008
01:34:48,750 --> 01:34:50,958
You've done it to me

2009
01:34:52,458 --> 01:34:56,833
You're puttin' me under

2010
01:34:56,875 --> 01:34:59,333
I close my eyes at night

2011
01:34:59,375 --> 01:35:01,583
Sittin' under sky

2012
01:35:01,583 --> 01:35:04,750
I love you and all is pleasures

2013
01:35:04,792 --> 01:35:06,583
Baby, feels so right

2014
01:35:06,625 --> 01:35:11,583
My arms won't be
of any use at all

2015
01:35:11,625 --> 01:35:15,958
If I can't hold you

2016
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:23,708
'Cause your love's
the killin' kind

2017
01:35:23,708 --> 01:35:27,667
Your love's the killin' kind

ROBBIE WILLIAMS:
Not of this earth

2020
01:35:41,625 --> 01:35:44,958
You've changed places
with the sun

2021
01:35:47,583 --> 01:35:50,375
I know that you're the one

2022
01:35:52,792 --> 01:35:55,458
I love what we've become

2023
01:35:57,750 --> 01:36:01,875
Not of this earth

2024
01:36:03,375 --> 01:36:06,583
Not surprised we're unashamed

2025
01:36:08,625 --> 01:36:11,792
She's gonna have
to change her name

2026
01:36:14,333 --> 01:36:16,833
Then we'll know
they'll be the same

2027
01:36:19,375 --> 01:36:23,750
She's not of this earth

2028
01:36:23,792 --> 01:36:29,500
And I believe
we've seen the worst

2029
01:36:29,542 --> 01:36:33,375
If I ever leave this world

2030
01:36:34,875 --> 01:36:36,958
You will have a song to sing

2031
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:40,500
So you know what you're worth
