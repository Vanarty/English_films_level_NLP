1
00:01:38,733 --> 00:01:41,702
Alex, this way!

2
00:01:42,302 --> 00:01:43,738
Come on!

3
00:01:55,116 --> 00:01:56,083
Hurry.

4
00:02:03,724 --> 00:02:05,159
Get in and don't come out.

5
00:02:05,259 --> 00:02:06,761
Daniel, I'm scared.

6
00:02:16,904 --> 00:02:18,005
Shh.

7
00:02:18,306 --> 00:02:20,473
Daniel, please.
They're trying to kill me.

8
00:02:20,808 --> 00:02:23,911
Please help me.
Daniel, please.

9
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:25,445
He's in here.

10
00:02:25,545 --> 00:02:26,981
No, no, no! God, no!

11
00:02:31,451 --> 00:02:32,419
No, Charles! Stop!

12
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:34,322
- Helene!
- No, please, stop it!

13
00:02:34,421 --> 00:02:36,090
No! Charles!

14
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:38,893
No. No.

15
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:40,828
Charles.

16
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:43,097
No, please. Please, stop.

17
00:02:43,197 --> 00:02:46,834
Please. No. You don't have to do this.

18
00:02:48,803 --> 00:02:51,839
Daniel, I'm so proud of you.

19
00:02:51,939 --> 00:02:53,040
Please, listen to...

20
00:02:55,009 --> 00:02:57,444
You don't have to do this.
Nothing's gonna happen.

21
00:02:59,347 --> 00:03:02,582
Helene! Helene,
please just talk to them.

22
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:04,085
Helene!

23
00:03:05,086 --> 00:03:07,722
Please, no! No! No, please!

24
00:03:07,822 --> 00:03:09,857
No!

25
00:03:16,264 --> 00:03:18,299
<i>To have and to hold.</i>

26
00:03:18,398 --> 00:03:20,134
<i>From this day forward.</i>

27
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:22,737
For better, for worse.

28
00:03:24,404 --> 00:03:27,507
For richer, for poorer.

29
00:03:28,608 --> 00:03:30,410
In sickness, and in health.

30
00:03:32,113 --> 00:03:33,680
Till death do us part.

31
00:03:35,983 --> 00:03:41,122
And even though your family
is richer than God,

32
00:03:41,621 --> 00:03:43,724
intimidates
the hell out of me...

33
00:03:44,591 --> 00:03:46,027
your dad definitely hates me,

34
00:03:46,127 --> 00:03:48,796
and your alcoholic brother
keeps hitting on me...

35
00:03:57,738 --> 00:04:01,675
I honestly can't wait to be a part
of your moderately fucked-up family.

36
00:04:01,776 --> 00:04:04,378
"Moderately"?
That's pretty generous.

37
00:04:04,477 --> 00:04:05,645
- Hi.
- Hey.

38
00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:08,149
Holy shit!

39
00:04:10,985 --> 00:04:12,086
You look perfect.

40
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,121
What're you doing?

41
00:04:14,221 --> 00:04:16,456
You smoking? In my old room?

42
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:18,726
Give me that.

43
00:04:20,394 --> 00:04:21,729
We should get down there.

44
00:04:22,562 --> 00:04:24,065
Your dad looks
like he's at a funeral.

45
00:04:24,165 --> 00:04:26,334
- He hates me.
- No. He doesn't hate you, Grace.

46
00:04:26,434 --> 00:04:27,634
He thinks
I'm after your money.

47
00:04:27,735 --> 00:04:30,470
Well, I mean, that's true.
Yeah.

48
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:32,572
- You just gotta give it time...
- So mean!

49
00:04:32,672 --> 00:04:34,641
What? No, it's true.

50
00:04:35,309 --> 00:04:37,178
Honey, just give it time.
Okay?

51
00:04:37,644 --> 00:04:39,080
- Okay.
- Okay? We sprung this on them.

52
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:42,717
- Yeah.
- They're used to a three-year courtship.

53
00:04:43,217 --> 00:04:44,617
And not what we did.

54
00:04:44,719 --> 00:04:46,120
The, I don't know,
18-month...

55
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,188
Bone-a-thon.

56
00:04:47,288 --> 00:04:49,056
"Bone-a-thon"? Okay. Yeah.

57
00:04:49,156 --> 00:04:51,092
- We should put that in the vows.
- I did.

58
00:04:51,192 --> 00:04:52,492
- Oh, good.
- Mm-hmm.

59
00:04:54,061 --> 00:04:56,563
Anyway, who cares what they think?
They're horrible people.

60
00:04:58,899 --> 00:05:00,968
Well, I-I care what they think.

61
00:05:01,068 --> 00:05:03,871
Because they are the family
of the man that I love.

62
00:05:03,971 --> 00:05:05,773
And I want them to accept me.

63
00:05:06,207 --> 00:05:08,476
Are you okay? 'Cause I'm
nervous enough as it is.

64
00:05:08,575 --> 00:05:10,211
No, it's not that. I just...

65
00:05:10,677 --> 00:05:12,213
Without you, I'm...

66
00:05:12,313 --> 00:05:14,148
- One of us.
- Hey.

67
00:05:14,248 --> 00:05:16,317
- Daniel.
- I've been sent to fetch you.

68
00:05:16,417 --> 00:05:21,322
<i>♪ Here comes the groom
shitting his pants ♪</i>

69
00:05:21,422 --> 00:05:22,356
<i>♪ He cannot believe ♪</i>

70
00:05:22,456 --> 00:05:24,691
- <i>♪ That his entire life is over ♪</i>
- Daniel, you fuck. Stop it.

71
00:05:24,792 --> 00:05:27,962
I'm gonna let you go
in three, two... release.

72
00:05:29,196 --> 00:05:30,297
Take it easy.

73
00:05:30,965 --> 00:05:33,267
It's not too late to flee,
you know.

74
00:05:33,367 --> 00:05:34,802
You don't belong
in this family.

75
00:05:34,902 --> 00:05:36,669
I mean that
as a compliment.

76
00:05:40,775 --> 00:05:43,844
Okay. Well, if you're still
determined to be a Le Domas,

77
00:05:43,944 --> 00:05:46,881
then would you please
get yourselves outside. Okay?

78
00:05:47,448 --> 00:05:49,616
Congratulations, you fuckface.

79
00:05:50,518 --> 00:05:51,752
Thank you.

80
00:05:53,653 --> 00:05:57,024
I can't believe
that in half an hour...

81
00:05:57,825 --> 00:06:02,695
I will be a part of
the Le Domas gaming...

82
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:04,799
dynasty? Empire?

83
00:06:04,899 --> 00:06:06,467
"Dominion."
We prefer "dominion."

84
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:08,169
- "Dominion."
- Yeah. But...

85
00:06:08,635 --> 00:06:10,670
Um...

86
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,841
You know, Daniel's right.

87
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:18,879
We could just... leave.

88
00:06:18,979 --> 00:06:21,348
Oh, sure, yeah. "Thanks for the presents.
Go fuck yourselves."

89
00:06:21,449 --> 00:06:23,884
No. I'm serious, I'm serious, honey.

90
00:06:28,322 --> 00:06:29,990
I'm giving you an out.

91
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:32,159
Right now.

92
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:38,631
No, thank you.
I'm all the way in.

93
00:06:46,807 --> 00:06:48,309
Are you ready for this?

94
00:06:48,409 --> 00:06:49,676
Oh, fuck no.

95
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,752
Smile, please.

96
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,323
He could've
done so much better.

97
00:07:02,423 --> 00:07:05,359
You're just saying that
because he's your favorite.

98
00:07:05,726 --> 00:07:09,897
Oh, please.
I love all of you... equally.

99
00:07:11,664 --> 00:07:14,667
Two years
is a long time, Alex.

100
00:07:15,002 --> 00:07:17,138
I started to think
we'd really lost you.

101
00:07:18,038 --> 00:07:20,741
Smile. Smile, please.

102
00:07:21,008 --> 00:07:23,177
The more natural the better.

103
00:07:23,676 --> 00:07:25,112
Okay, that's good.

104
00:07:25,212 --> 00:07:27,047
Don't take it personally.

105
00:07:27,148 --> 00:07:30,050
They're just trying to figure out
if you're a gold-digging whore.

106
00:07:30,818 --> 00:07:32,086
You know, like my wife.

107
00:07:32,186 --> 00:07:33,454
To the left.

108
00:07:33,554 --> 00:07:34,687
She's pretty enough,

109
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:37,158
in a "last call at
the dive bar" kinda way.

110
00:07:38,459 --> 00:07:39,692
But she'll never be one of us.

111
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:41,762
Of course not, dear.

112
00:07:42,229 --> 00:07:43,831
She has a soul.

113
00:07:43,931 --> 00:07:45,466
Where the hell's your sister?

114
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,667
I'm sure it's Fitch's fault.

115
00:07:47,768 --> 00:07:50,104
He's useless.
But he's one of us.

116
00:07:51,038 --> 00:07:52,339
Is Grace?

117
00:07:56,911 --> 00:07:58,913
There you are.

118
00:07:59,013 --> 00:08:00,214
Hi!

119
00:08:00,314 --> 00:08:01,348
Hi.

120
00:08:04,518 --> 00:08:06,153
- Give me a hand.
- Oh. Okay.

121
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:12,626
It's a beautiful case, wow.

122
00:08:12,726 --> 00:08:14,461
Thank you. It was my mother's.

123
00:08:14,895 --> 00:08:16,197
Do you smoke?

124
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:18,032
Oh, no.

125
00:08:20,067 --> 00:08:21,035
Nervous?

126
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:23,871
Ah.

127
00:08:23,971 --> 00:08:26,540
Because your blood
isn't blue enough?

128
00:08:27,741 --> 00:08:30,110
They said
the same thing about me.

129
00:08:30,211 --> 00:08:31,412
They did?

130
00:08:31,512 --> 00:08:34,515
Stand tall and fuck 'em.

131
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:39,787
The only thing that matters
is what Alex thinks.

132
00:08:40,354 --> 00:08:43,123
And that we know.

133
00:08:51,498 --> 00:08:53,601
- I love you.
- I love you.

134
00:08:53,702 --> 00:08:54,735
I have something?

135
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:32,273
Oh, shit. Shh.

136
00:09:34,408 --> 00:09:37,511
Do you remember
anything that happened today?

137
00:09:37,611 --> 00:09:38,713
It's a goddamn blur.

138
00:09:38,812 --> 00:09:40,547
- But I'm pretty sure...
- Yeah.

139
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:43,284
- Did we get married?
- We got married.

140
00:09:43,384 --> 00:09:44,585
Are you my wife?

141
00:09:44,685 --> 00:09:46,954
- Holy shit. Holy fucking shit.
- Yes. You're my husband!

142
00:09:47,054 --> 00:09:49,256
Oh, my God. Shit. Oh, babe.

143
00:09:49,356 --> 00:09:50,491
- Babe.
- Hey.

144
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:51,558
It's hard with this thing.

145
00:09:51,659 --> 00:09:52,893
- I know. Listen.
- Hold me.

146
00:09:52,993 --> 00:09:54,128
- I have to tell you something...
- Mm-mm.

147
00:09:54,228 --> 00:09:55,963
Shut up.
Take your pants off.

148
00:09:56,063 --> 00:09:57,231
No, I have to tell you
something.

149
00:09:57,331 --> 00:09:59,333
- Grace, honey.
- I'm taking 'em off.

150
00:10:02,903 --> 00:10:04,471
Holy shit! Holy shit.
Someone's here.

151
00:10:04,571 --> 00:10:05,839
What?

152
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:07,941
Jesus, Aunt Helene!
Can you give us a minute?

153
00:10:08,042 --> 00:10:10,611
You'll have to hide
better than that.

154
00:10:10,712 --> 00:10:12,613
We're not fucking hiding,
obviously.

155
00:10:12,714 --> 00:10:14,348
Everyone is waiting.

156
00:10:14,448 --> 00:10:16,483
Yeah, we'll be down
in a few minutes.

157
00:10:20,789 --> 00:10:22,956
- I'm sorry, honey.
- What the hell was that?

158
00:10:23,057 --> 00:10:24,325
That's my aunt Helene.

159
00:10:24,425 --> 00:10:27,628
She has, um...
well, she has boundary issues.

160
00:10:27,729 --> 00:10:28,962
Yeah.

161
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:33,033
Of course
you have a secret door.

162
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:34,635
It's a servant's corridor.

163
00:10:35,235 --> 00:10:36,705
They run
all through the house.

164
00:10:38,939 --> 00:10:41,175
Um, sorry, who's waiting?

165
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:44,945
That's what I was trying
to tell you. Um...

166
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:54,321
So, at midnight
you have to play a game.

167
00:10:55,522 --> 00:10:58,492
It's just something we do when
someone new joins the family.

168
00:10:59,526 --> 00:11:00,661
- A game?
- Yeah.

169
00:11:00,762 --> 00:11:02,196
What game?

170
00:11:02,296 --> 00:11:04,865
I don't know.
Uh, you draw a card.

171
00:11:05,566 --> 00:11:09,069
Could be backgammon, croquet,
checkers, for all I know.

172
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:11,605
I know. I know. It's stupid.

173
00:11:11,706 --> 00:11:13,474
It's a little weird.

174
00:11:13,574 --> 00:11:15,342
Why, exactly?

175
00:11:15,442 --> 00:11:20,080
I guess, because we made our money in
games, it's part of the initiation.

176
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:23,617
- Do I have to win?
- No. You just... you just have to play.

177
00:11:23,718 --> 00:11:26,220
- And then...
- And then you...

178
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,389
you are officially
part of the family.

179
00:11:28,489 --> 00:11:31,358
Honestly, it means more to
them than the wedding itself.

180
00:11:33,994 --> 00:11:35,996
- That's it?
- Yeah, that's it.

181
00:11:36,964 --> 00:11:38,899
I know it's ridiculous.

182
00:11:38,999 --> 00:11:40,367
It's just a weird
family ritual.

183
00:11:40,467 --> 00:11:41,935
And we only have to
do it once. All right?

184
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:44,571
Okay.

185
00:11:44,972 --> 00:11:46,173
- Yeah.
- Okay.

186
00:11:46,273 --> 00:11:48,275
If it gets your family
to accept me,

187
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:53,380
I will play the shit out...
of checkers.

188
00:11:54,982 --> 00:11:56,851
- I'm really good at it.
- Okay.

189
00:11:56,950 --> 00:12:02,423
Okay. You go buy me ten minutes
'cause I gotta put on... my game face.

190
00:12:02,523 --> 00:12:04,958
- I see what you did there. Very good.
- Right.

191
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:08,061
Okay. So, uh, I'll meet you
downstairs. Music room.

192
00:12:08,162 --> 00:12:10,865
Ah. Yes. A totally normal room
to have in a house.

193
00:12:10,964 --> 00:12:14,368
Just... It is just downstairs.
It's your second door on the right.

194
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:16,570
Okay.

195
00:12:34,722 --> 00:12:37,090
<i>I thought
I might find you here.</i>

196
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:45,132
I'm sure Mr. Le Bail
is with us today.

197
00:12:47,334 --> 00:12:49,838
<i>So, how much
have you told her?</i>

198
00:12:49,938 --> 00:12:52,874
<i>Nothing.
And I never will.</i>

199
00:12:52,973 --> 00:12:54,475
<i>Tomorrow we're gone.</i>

200
00:12:55,743 --> 00:12:57,144
<i>If she pulls that card,</i>

201
00:12:57,244 --> 00:13:00,080
<i>are you prepared
to do what's necessary?</i>

202
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:14,796
Excuse me, whatever you wanna
say, get on with it please.

203
00:13:14,896 --> 00:13:18,733
You better hurry your ass
up and get here before midnight.

204
00:13:20,167 --> 00:13:22,402
Call me when
you get this message.

205
00:13:25,807 --> 00:13:27,608
Dora, two more, please.

206
00:13:29,911 --> 00:13:32,513
- Grace, darling.
- Hi.

207
00:13:32,613 --> 00:13:35,649
- Your vows were beautiful.
- Oh. Thank you.

208
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:39,286
Alex didn't tell us you were
brought up in foster homes.

209
00:13:39,386 --> 00:13:42,656
Not that he tells us anything
these days. Champagne?

210
00:13:42,757 --> 00:13:44,057
Oh. Thank you. Thanks.

211
00:13:44,558 --> 00:13:46,493
My foster parents
were great people.

212
00:13:47,027 --> 00:13:49,029
And, you know,
they did what they could.

213
00:13:49,129 --> 00:13:50,798
But it was always temporary.

214
00:13:51,398 --> 00:13:54,234
I always sort of dreamed
of having a... a family.

215
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:57,471
I mean, I'm sure Alex would've
loved living in sin forever.

216
00:13:57,571 --> 00:13:59,007
I don't doubt it.

217
00:13:59,373 --> 00:14:05,145
But he, um, he really understood
how important it was for me to...

218
00:14:06,714 --> 00:14:12,352
finally have a real,
permanent family.

219
00:14:13,387 --> 00:14:15,422
And I just don't
wanna let you down.

220
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:19,092
Grace. When I first saw you,
I said to Tony:

221
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:23,096
"Finally. One of our children
has brought home a good one."

222
00:14:23,597 --> 00:14:28,468
And you don't know how grateful we
are that you brought Alex back to us.

223
00:14:29,704 --> 00:14:32,139
But please...

224
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:35,642
try to bring him back
into the fold.

225
00:14:37,712 --> 00:14:39,246
We're his family.

226
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,715
I promise.

227
00:14:43,017 --> 00:14:44,284
Oh, sweetheart.

228
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:46,653
I knew you would.

229
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:52,626
Oh!

230
00:14:52,727 --> 00:14:53,728
- Hey.
- Hi!

231
00:14:53,828 --> 00:14:55,596
Mom, I'm just gonna
steal her away. Okay?

232
00:14:55,696 --> 00:14:56,798
Mmm.

233
00:14:57,497 --> 00:14:58,532
- Hi.
- Hi.

234
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:00,768
What'd she say to you?

235
00:15:00,868 --> 00:15:02,135
Oh, she's so sweet.

236
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:03,503
Did she say anything?

237
00:15:03,604 --> 00:15:04,671
No. No.

238
00:15:04,772 --> 00:15:05,807
All right.

239
00:15:07,976 --> 00:15:10,044
Are you okay?
Did something happen?

240
00:15:10,143 --> 00:15:11,378
Yeah, no.

241
00:15:11,478 --> 00:15:13,113
I just,
I don't feel very well.

242
00:15:13,213 --> 00:15:16,183
Well, if you wanna lie down,
can't we just play the game tomorrow?

243
00:15:16,283 --> 00:15:17,719
- No, no, it has to be tonight.
- Hands up!

244
00:15:17,819 --> 00:15:21,154
- Kill, kill, kill! Kill, kill, kill!
- No! No!

245
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:23,323
- Hey!
- Get him, Georgie!

246
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:25,192
Whoo!
We made it, Daddy.

247
00:15:25,292 --> 00:15:26,728
Take it off, now!

248
00:15:26,828 --> 00:15:29,731
- Daddy?
- You just keep on playing there, buddy.

249
00:15:30,564 --> 00:15:32,100
Oh, you're so tense.

250
00:15:32,199 --> 00:15:33,300
- Le Bail's gonna get you.
- Asshole.

251
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,869
- Kill, kill!
- Mr. Le Bail!

252
00:15:34,969 --> 00:15:37,237
You. Lady in white.

253
00:15:38,006 --> 00:15:40,008
Look at this, you must be the bride.

254
00:15:40,108 --> 00:15:41,642
- Hi.
- Fitch Bradley.

255
00:15:41,743 --> 00:15:42,710
Grace.

256
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:43,778
Pleasure.

257
00:15:43,878 --> 00:15:45,612
- Alex.
- Hi, Fitch. How are you?

258
00:15:45,713 --> 00:15:48,016
Well done.
Sorry we cut it so close.

259
00:15:48,116 --> 00:15:51,151
We couldn't get our regular charter
out of de Gaulle this morning.

260
00:15:51,251 --> 00:15:54,154
And I cannot fly
commercial anymore, right?

261
00:15:54,254 --> 00:15:56,090
- It's the worst. You understand.
- Grace!

262
00:15:56,189 --> 00:15:57,190
Hi!

263
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:58,358
- Hi!
- I'm Emilie.

264
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:00,260
Oh, my God,
your dress is amazing!

265
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,929
I've been totally
stalking you on Instagram.

266
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:03,765
Oh, really? That's...

267
00:16:06,701 --> 00:16:08,770
We're gonna be best friends.

268
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:10,404
Hi. Nice to see you.

269
00:16:11,271 --> 00:16:12,940
I'm so excited to be
a part of your family.

270
00:16:13,041 --> 00:16:14,408
Me too, me too!

271
00:16:14,508 --> 00:16:17,411
He will decide that, my dear.

272
00:16:17,511 --> 00:16:20,014
Aunt Helene.
It's nice to see you.

273
00:16:20,114 --> 00:16:22,050
Brown-haired niece.

274
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:24,317
You continue to exist.

275
00:16:25,452 --> 00:16:29,623
Ladies and gentlemen,
it is 11:55.

276
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:37,932
This is gonna blow your mind.

277
00:16:38,231 --> 00:16:39,834
Oh, okay.

278
00:16:42,536 --> 00:16:46,506
So this room is reserved
for family members only.

279
00:16:51,012 --> 00:16:52,646
After you, my dear.

280
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:00,253
Holy shit.

281
00:17:09,831 --> 00:17:12,432
Great-Grandfather
enjoyed his games.

282
00:17:33,653 --> 00:17:34,688
Grace.

283
00:17:38,726 --> 00:17:39,927
Have a seat.

284
00:17:44,031 --> 00:17:45,432
Do you like to play games?

285
00:17:45,867 --> 00:17:49,971
Um, I guess it depends on
what we're playing.

286
00:17:50,071 --> 00:17:52,305
Well, we'll know in a moment.

287
00:17:53,174 --> 00:17:57,377
I gather you've noticed our
family is big on tradition.

288
00:17:58,345 --> 00:18:04,919
And now, well, now the time has come
for you to join us in those traditions.

289
00:18:05,019 --> 00:18:06,486
Ooh. Story time.

290
00:18:07,155 --> 00:18:09,356
As you may know,
my great-grandfather, Victor,

291
00:18:09,456 --> 00:18:13,161
set up a modest printing shop
during the Civil War,

292
00:18:13,261 --> 00:18:14,762
manufacturing playing cards.

293
00:18:14,862 --> 00:18:16,164
A generation later,

294
00:18:16,264 --> 00:18:20,400
my grandfather expanded into
sporting goods and board games.

295
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:25,873
Under my leadership, Le Domas Family Games
acquired four professional sports teams

296
00:18:25,973 --> 00:18:29,476
and reached,
well, even greater heights.

297
00:18:30,144 --> 00:18:32,213
Some may call it luck,

298
00:18:32,312 --> 00:18:35,049
but, well,
it's a little more than that.

299
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:39,887
You know, it's almost as if
someone's watching over us.

300
00:18:39,987 --> 00:18:42,890
It all began with
a very generous benefactor.

301
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:45,492
And this box.

302
00:18:46,727 --> 00:18:50,832
You see, originally,
Great-Grandfather was a merchant seaman.

303
00:18:50,932 --> 00:18:52,166
It was a hard life.

304
00:18:52,266 --> 00:18:54,668
And, like so many,
he wanted more.

305
00:18:55,502 --> 00:18:57,537
On one of his
many excursions abroad,

306
00:18:57,637 --> 00:19:00,842
Great-Grandfather
came to meet a Mr. Le Bail.

307
00:19:00,942 --> 00:19:03,443
He was a... He was
a passenger aboard the ship.

308
00:19:03,543 --> 00:19:05,146
A collector, of sorts.

309
00:19:05,246 --> 00:19:08,749
Purchasing exotic antiquities
to resell to wealthy Americans.

310
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:12,854
After discovering a mutual
passion for games of chance,

311
00:19:12,954 --> 00:19:15,689
they passed a great many hours
playing cards.

312
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:20,261
And among Mr. Le Bail's
possessions was...

313
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:22,529
that box.

314
00:19:22,629 --> 00:19:24,999
And one evening,
after indulging in more than

315
00:19:25,099 --> 00:19:26,600
their fair ration of rum...

316
00:19:26,701 --> 00:19:29,136
Mr. Le Bail
proposed a wager.

317
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:33,941
If Great-Grandfather could
solve the mystery of the box

318
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:35,675
before arriving at port,

319
00:19:35,776 --> 00:19:39,479
Mr. Le Bail would finance any
endeavor of Grandfather's choosing.

320
00:19:40,114 --> 00:19:41,148
Well...

321
00:19:42,216 --> 00:19:47,154
Great-Grandfather whiled away the
long hours at sea studying the box.

322
00:19:47,255 --> 00:19:48,222
Until finally...

323
00:19:54,328 --> 00:19:55,528
And since that time...

324
00:19:56,429 --> 00:20:01,969
whenever the Le Domases are presented
with a new addition to the family...

325
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:07,775
we place a blank
playing card into the box.

326
00:20:08,876 --> 00:20:14,481
Our initiate then has the
privilege of drawing the card,

327
00:20:14,581 --> 00:20:19,153
and Mr. Le Bail will tell us
which game to play.

328
00:20:21,188 --> 00:20:22,156
I got chess.

329
00:20:22,256 --> 00:20:23,556
I got Old Maid.

330
00:20:24,058 --> 00:20:25,993
Seriously,
what the fuck is Old Maid?

331
00:20:26,093 --> 00:20:27,194
Fitch...

332
00:20:35,169 --> 00:20:37,838
So I just take out the card?

333
00:20:39,639 --> 00:20:42,777
My dear, it is your turn.

334
00:20:55,455 --> 00:20:57,325
What does it say, girl?

335
00:20:57,425 --> 00:20:59,193
Oh. It says...

336
00:20:59,293 --> 00:21:00,627
It says, "hide and seek."

337
00:21:00,728 --> 00:21:02,462
Are we really gonna play that?

338
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:11,973
Everything okay?

339
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:14,175
Uh...

340
00:21:14,275 --> 00:21:17,178
Yeah. Yeah.
Those are the rules.

341
00:21:18,813 --> 00:21:20,513
Hide and seek, right, Dad?

342
00:21:22,316 --> 00:21:23,851
Yes, indeed.

343
00:21:25,119 --> 00:21:26,320
Those are the rules.

344
00:21:27,221 --> 00:21:31,258
Okay, so, uh, who...
who hides and who seeks?

345
00:21:31,359 --> 00:21:34,895
Well, it's your initiation,
my dear.

346
00:21:34,996 --> 00:21:37,664
You get to be the one
to, uh, to hide.

347
00:21:38,399 --> 00:21:39,333
Of course.

348
00:21:41,268 --> 00:21:43,838
This is gonna be fun, honey.
Yeah, just come meet me in my room, okay?

349
00:21:43,938 --> 00:21:46,407
- No, I wanna play for real. This is so weird.
- No, no. I know.

350
00:21:46,506 --> 00:21:49,944
Um, so, to Mister... Le Bail.

351
00:21:52,446 --> 00:21:53,414
To Mr. Le Bail.

352
00:21:53,513 --> 00:21:56,050
- To Mr. Le Bail.
- To Mr. Le Bail.

353
00:21:58,419 --> 00:22:00,354
<i>The rules are simple.</i>

354
00:22:00,488 --> 00:22:03,057
You can hide
anywhere inside the house.

355
00:22:03,424 --> 00:22:08,561
We then count to 100 and
try to, um... well, find you.

356
00:22:08,863 --> 00:22:11,698
Well, don't you think you have
a little bit of an advantage?

357
00:22:12,233 --> 00:22:14,702
Oh. No, no.
We never use the cameras.

358
00:22:14,802 --> 00:22:18,806
<i>We always play the games as they would've
been played in Great-Grandfather's time.</i>

359
00:22:18,906 --> 00:22:19,740
<i>Always.</i>

360
00:22:20,041 --> 00:22:22,675
So, there's no way
for me to win, right?

361
00:22:22,777 --> 00:22:26,914
Well, you could, I mean,
stay hidden till dawn.

362
00:22:29,383 --> 00:22:30,751
- No, thank you.
- No.

363
00:22:30,851 --> 00:22:33,287
<i>We're gonna start the count</i>

364
00:22:33,387 --> 00:22:35,189
just as soon
as you leave, okay?

365
00:22:35,289 --> 00:22:36,424
Okay.

366
00:22:36,524 --> 00:22:38,993
Grace, good luck.

367
00:22:58,913 --> 00:23:01,282
<i>Who wants to play a game?</i>

368
00:23:01,382 --> 00:23:03,517

Watch the door.

414
00:25:18,619 --> 00:25:20,087
Thank you, Charity.

415
00:25:20,921 --> 00:25:24,959
So, how was your
wedding night, Grace?

416
00:25:25,659 --> 00:25:27,027
Oh.

417
00:25:27,995 --> 00:25:31,732
It was just great.
Just great. I, uh...

418
00:25:33,434 --> 00:25:34,868
I sat in a dumbwaiter.

419
00:26:15,776 --> 00:26:19,313
Alex, honey,
do you want some company?

420
00:26:23,951 --> 00:26:25,452
Oh, fuck me.

421
00:26:36,563 --> 00:26:38,299
How long is this gonna take?

422
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:41,035
How long
does this usually take?

423
00:26:41,135 --> 00:26:43,203
There is nothing usual
about this.

424
00:26:43,304 --> 00:26:46,140
It's only happened once
since I joined the family.

425
00:26:49,143 --> 00:26:51,478
Am I really supposed to know
how to use this thing?

426
00:26:55,516 --> 00:26:56,617
Oh, you know what?

427
00:26:56,718 --> 00:26:57,951
I'm just gonna
make a quick pit stop.

428
00:26:58,052 --> 00:26:59,586
I've got a nervous stomach.

429
00:27:01,021 --> 00:27:03,357
You know I've never
liked you, right?

430
00:27:04,391 --> 00:27:06,994
Uh...

431
00:27:12,734 --> 00:27:13,768
All right.

432
00:27:14,168 --> 00:27:15,569
That's enough of this.

433
00:27:34,154 --> 00:27:36,557
Shit.

434
00:27:40,527 --> 00:27:42,196
Shit.

435
00:27:53,874 --> 00:27:55,109
Oh, shit.

436
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:57,945
Georgie.

437
00:28:03,752 --> 00:28:05,085
Georgie.

438
00:28:16,997 --> 00:28:18,999
Shh.

439
00:28:19,801 --> 00:28:21,001
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Jesus.

440
00:28:21,101 --> 00:28:22,636
- I nearly pissed myself.
- I know.

441
00:28:22,737 --> 00:28:24,538
- You need to listen to me very carefully.
- Georgie.

442
00:28:24,638 --> 00:28:28,008
- Shit. Come with me.
- Wait. What are we doing?

443
00:28:29,643 --> 00:28:32,781
- Get down. Grab your dress, grab your dress.
- Okay. Jesus.

444
00:28:35,315 --> 00:28:38,552
Georgie,
I know you're in here.

445
00:28:59,673 --> 00:29:00,875
Georg...

446
00:29:02,643 --> 00:29:04,411
Over here!
Over here, over here!

447
00:29:04,779 --> 00:29:07,014
Guys, I found her!

448
00:29:08,415 --> 00:29:10,551
I did it!

449
00:29:10,651 --> 00:29:13,721
Dad! Daddy, I did it! Look!

450
00:29:14,154 --> 00:29:15,522
Daddy, come see what I mean...

451
00:29:15,622 --> 00:29:17,991
Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit.

452
00:29:19,828 --> 00:29:23,397
Oh, Jesus Christ.

453
00:29:24,131 --> 00:29:25,566
This is Clara.

454
00:29:25,666 --> 00:29:27,067
Does she look
like she's wearing

455
00:29:27,167 --> 00:29:29,269
a giant, white
wedding dress, Emilie?

456
00:29:29,369 --> 00:29:31,305
Why did you shoot her in the
face, sweetheart?

457
00:29:31,405 --> 00:29:33,875
You're supposed to maim her.
She needs to be alive for the ritual.

458
00:29:33,974 --> 00:29:34,943
I don't know.

459
00:29:35,042 --> 00:29:36,510
- I heard a shot.
- Yeah.

460
00:29:37,478 --> 00:29:38,345
Oh.

461
00:29:38,445 --> 00:29:40,080
Well, if she dies,
does this count?

462
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:43,484
Of course it does not count.
It must be the bride.

463
00:29:43,885 --> 00:29:45,219
Well, what do we do now?

464
00:29:45,319 --> 00:29:47,020
Well, I don't know.
I'm... I'm thinking.

465
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:50,090
Clara, hey.

466
00:29:50,524 --> 00:29:52,927
It's gonna be okay.

467
00:29:54,228 --> 00:29:56,798
Oh, Daniel, could you?

468
00:29:56,898 --> 00:29:57,932
Come on, let's take a walk.

469
00:29:58,031 --> 00:29:59,633
She's gonna die, guys.

470
00:30:00,133 --> 00:30:01,535
Walk it off.

471
00:30:04,137 --> 00:30:07,174
So, what do we do with her?

472
00:30:07,274 --> 00:30:09,643
Move her.
We don't want Grace to see.

473
00:30:09,744 --> 00:30:11,345
Give me the fucking lanterns.

474
00:30:12,279 --> 00:30:13,848
Okay. Call it.

475
00:30:15,148 --> 00:30:16,885
- Heads.
- Heads it is.

476
00:30:16,985 --> 00:30:18,887
- You get the legs.
- Okay.

477
00:30:18,987 --> 00:30:20,722
Hold on.

478
00:30:22,055 --> 00:30:25,092
It's slipping. Yeah, good.
Oh, good. Okay. Go.

479
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:28,195
She was my favorite.

480
00:30:29,229 --> 00:30:30,631
Wait here. Don't move.

481
00:30:37,104 --> 00:30:40,641
Okay, sweetie, you gotta get up.
We gotta get you out of here right now.

482
00:30:40,742 --> 00:30:42,042
Okay. Stand up, here we go.

483
00:30:42,142 --> 00:30:44,812
Okay. Okay, grab...
grab your phone. Grab the keys.

484
00:30:45,546 --> 00:30:47,381
Fuck. Shit.

485
00:30:47,481 --> 00:30:49,550
Okay. Stevens must've
taken the phone, so...

486
00:30:49,650 --> 00:30:52,020
- Alex, what the fuck?
- You're gonna have to run, okay?

487
00:30:52,119 --> 00:30:54,756
Hide and seek.
You pulled the one bad card.

488
00:30:55,823 --> 00:30:59,493
They think... They think they
have to kill you before sunrise.

489
00:31:00,028 --> 00:31:01,595
- What the fuck?
- Follow me.

490
00:31:04,131 --> 00:31:04,966
One sec!

491
00:31:05,065 --> 00:31:06,533
I forgot my gun.

492
00:31:08,870 --> 00:31:10,137
Okay.

493
00:31:10,237 --> 00:31:12,040
Okay, girl, no more fuckups.

494
00:31:12,139 --> 00:31:14,842
- You're a winner.
- You got that?

495
00:31:23,918 --> 00:31:25,185
- Okay, you have your shoes?
- Alex.

496
00:31:25,285 --> 00:31:26,553
Honey, I need you
to put on your shoes.

497
00:31:26,653 --> 00:31:28,655
No, Alex, Alex,
what the fuck is going on?

498
00:31:28,756 --> 00:31:30,624
I need you to put
your shoes on. Right now.

499
00:31:30,725 --> 00:31:33,761
Okay, here we go. Here we go.

500
00:31:43,503 --> 00:31:44,538
Okay.

501
00:31:45,372 --> 00:31:48,208
They think that
if they don't kill you,

502
00:31:48,308 --> 00:31:50,510
something very bad
will happen to the family.

503
00:31:50,611 --> 00:31:54,882
Now... I had to play along
so that I can get you out.

504
00:31:54,983 --> 00:31:58,585
But the house is on lock down right
now, so it's gonna be really tricky.

505
00:31:58,685 --> 00:32:01,856
You knew what would happen
if I pulled that card.

506
00:32:01,956 --> 00:32:03,825
- I didn't think they'd actually go through with it.
- Fucking knew!

507
00:32:03,925 --> 00:32:05,860
No one ever pulls that.
It never fucking happens.

508
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,996
- Yeah, but you knew about it!
- No, no, I didn't.

509
00:32:12,165 --> 00:32:14,836
- <i>I'm Richard Babis.</i>
- <i>And I'm Charlie.</i>

510
00:32:14,936 --> 00:32:16,303
<i>And today's segment is called</i>

511
00:32:16,403 --> 00:32:18,438
<i>"Getting to know
your crossbow."</i>

512
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:22,242
Oh, fuck. I really...
I thought it was safe.

513
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:28,615
But if I didn't
pull a card at all, then...

514
00:32:28,716 --> 00:32:30,885
Then your crazy family
wouldn't be trying to...

515
00:32:30,985 --> 00:32:33,520
- Oh, my God, they're gonna kill me.
- No, then we'd both be dead.

516
00:32:35,757 --> 00:32:38,258
When you marry into this
family you have to play a game.

517
00:32:38,358 --> 00:32:40,028
And if you don't, you die.

518
00:32:40,128 --> 00:32:43,163
I know that sounds crazy,
but you have to believe me, it is real.

519
00:32:44,098 --> 00:32:45,666
It happened to my great-uncle.

520
00:32:45,767 --> 00:32:48,535
He got married, he didn't play a
game, next morning he died.

521
00:32:48,635 --> 00:32:50,805
His wife too. Same thing
happened to my cousin Rachel.

522
00:32:50,905 --> 00:32:54,408
Same thing happened to a bunch of people
that I never even met before. You just...

523
00:32:56,711 --> 00:32:57,879
You have to play.

524
00:32:59,747 --> 00:33:03,550
You said your family
was... fucked-up,

525
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:06,253
- but you didn't say psycho killers.
- I know.

526
00:33:06,353 --> 00:33:12,259
- You... you brought me here, you didn't warn me.
- You wanted to get married.

527
00:33:12,359 --> 00:33:14,162
- So it's my fucking fault?
- No. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

528
00:33:14,261 --> 00:33:16,229
- Are you fucking serious?
- Shh.

529
00:33:16,329 --> 00:33:17,698
- We could've eloped.
- I know.

530
00:33:17,799 --> 00:33:19,801
- We could've...
- No, no. There are rules.

531
00:33:19,901 --> 00:33:21,069
You can't just elope.

532
00:33:21,169 --> 00:33:22,302
You... you have to have
the wedding here,

533
00:33:22,402 --> 00:33:24,972
and you have to play
the fucking game.

534
00:33:26,941 --> 00:33:30,377
You didn't even fucking talk to me.
You could've told me. We could've...

535
00:33:31,578 --> 00:33:33,915
- Just...
- If I told you, you would've left.

536
00:33:42,255 --> 00:33:44,624
And if I didn't propose,
you would've left.

537
00:33:47,128 --> 00:33:49,063
You're everything to me,
and I promise you

538
00:33:49,163 --> 00:33:51,231
I'm gonna get you
out of here, okay?

539
00:33:51,331 --> 00:33:53,935
All right?
So just listen to me.

540
00:33:54,035 --> 00:33:55,635
You just need to go

541
00:33:55,737 --> 00:33:57,105
straight down this hallway until
you get to the service kitchen.

542
00:33:57,205 --> 00:33:58,740
I'm gonna go down
to the security room.

543
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:01,441
I'm gonna unlock all the doors.
I'm gonna unlock all the doors.

544
00:34:01,541 --> 00:34:02,844
- No. Don't fucking leave me.
- Then you just fucking run.

545
00:34:02,944 --> 00:34:04,946
I have to. Honey, I have to.

546
00:34:05,545 --> 00:34:07,882
Just... just stay inside the
walls until you get to the kit...

547
00:34:07,982 --> 00:34:10,752
Hey. Hey. You can do this.
Where you going?

548
00:34:11,753 --> 00:34:13,587
Straight
and then, um, kitchen.

549
00:34:13,687 --> 00:34:15,723
To the kitchen.
Good. Good. Hey. Hey.

550
00:34:16,289 --> 00:34:17,859
You're gonna make it.
It's gonna be okay.

551
00:34:18,192 --> 00:34:19,861
- I love you.
- I love you.

552
00:34:21,763 --> 00:34:22,596
Go. Go.

553
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:26,801
Okay.

554
00:34:26,901 --> 00:34:27,802
Fuck.

555
00:34:31,739 --> 00:34:32,907
Okay.

556
00:35:37,038 --> 00:35:38,105
Fuck.

557
00:35:41,474 --> 00:35:42,910
Oh, hey. Any sign of her?

558
00:35:43,010 --> 00:35:44,946
No. She could be anywhere.

559
00:35:51,919 --> 00:35:53,353
Found her.

560
00:36:00,094 --> 00:36:01,796
Jesus! Fuck!

561
00:36:01,896 --> 00:36:02,864
Goddammit!

562
00:36:02,964 --> 00:36:07,068
Emilie, aim for
the center of gravity!

563
00:36:07,168 --> 00:36:08,368
I don't know what I'm doing!

564
00:36:28,588 --> 00:36:30,892
Help, help, help, help.

565
00:36:30,992 --> 00:36:32,059
Fuck.

566
00:36:38,866 --> 00:36:40,667
Shh.

567
00:36:54,481 --> 00:36:56,050
I just came to get a drink.

568
00:37:07,694 --> 00:37:09,096
I have to call the others.

569
00:37:11,165 --> 00:37:12,499
No, you don't.

570
00:37:13,134 --> 00:37:14,101
No.

571
00:37:14,201 --> 00:37:16,003
You can help me. Please.

572
00:37:17,504 --> 00:37:19,606
This doesn't end well for you.

573
00:37:20,775 --> 00:37:23,110
I just don't wanna be
the one to serve you up.

574
00:37:23,778 --> 00:37:26,914
Daniel, I'm begging you.

575
00:37:30,918 --> 00:37:32,887
I'm really sorry
about all this.

576
00:37:32,987 --> 00:37:36,157
It's true what they say:
The rich really are different.

577
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:41,228
I'll give you
a ten-second head start.

578
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:44,464
Daniel.

579
00:37:57,278 --> 00:37:58,611
One, one thousand.

580
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:01,949
Two, one thousand.

581
00:38:03,851 --> 00:38:05,853
<i>Two and a half, one thousand.</i>

582
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:13,593
She's in the study!

583
00:38:14,795 --> 00:38:16,629
<i>Point
the weapon away from you.</i>

584
00:38:27,074 --> 00:38:28,175
You lost her?

585
00:38:29,542 --> 00:38:30,878
Indeed.

586
00:38:31,312 --> 00:38:32,747
You're pathetic.

587
00:38:33,546 --> 00:38:34,849
Indeed.

588
00:38:36,784 --> 00:38:38,953
Could you at least
pretend to care?

589
00:38:39,053 --> 00:38:44,058
Oh, I'm sure you'll find her and
kill her with or without my help.

590
00:38:44,657 --> 00:38:47,928
You know, something did
occur to me, though.

591
00:38:48,029 --> 00:38:51,132
Alex may have been wrong
to keep Grace in the dark...

592
00:38:51,999 --> 00:38:54,135
but do you remember
how you reacted

593
00:38:54,235 --> 00:38:55,936
when I told you about this?

594
00:38:56,203 --> 00:38:57,705
You didn't fucking blink.

595
00:38:58,305 --> 00:39:02,243
I mean, you couldn't wait
to sign your soul away.

596
00:39:04,945 --> 00:39:07,547
You know where I came from

597
00:39:07,647 --> 00:39:09,750
and what my life
was like before.

598
00:39:10,751 --> 00:39:13,354
I'd rather be dead
than lose all of this.

599
00:39:13,454 --> 00:39:16,257
Well... from your lips.

600
00:39:25,232 --> 00:39:27,768
- Where is she?
- I'm afraid you just missed her.

601
00:39:27,868 --> 00:39:30,871
Tony, Alex got out.
I'm so sorry.

602
00:39:30,971 --> 00:39:31,906
Goddammit.

603
00:39:32,006 --> 00:39:33,974
Who's the fuckup now, right?

604
00:39:35,276 --> 00:39:36,544
Still me?

605
00:39:36,944 --> 00:39:38,512
Did you find her? Is it over?

606
00:39:38,611 --> 00:39:39,980
No, it's not over.

607
00:39:40,081 --> 00:39:41,749
And now she knows
what's going on.

608
00:39:41,849 --> 00:39:43,851
Oh, but Emilie shot Clara
in the face.

609
00:39:43,951 --> 00:39:46,087
So she's dead.
That's just a side note.

610
00:39:46,187 --> 00:39:47,354
Clara's dead?

611
00:39:48,389 --> 00:39:49,689
She was my favorite.

612
00:39:50,224 --> 00:39:52,026
Cock! I forgot my gun.

613
00:39:52,393 --> 00:39:54,528
Daddy, I forgot my gun.
I suck.

614
00:39:54,627 --> 00:39:56,230
- Oh, it's okay.
- I suck!

615
00:39:56,330 --> 00:39:57,465
You don't suck, sweetheart.

616
00:39:57,565 --> 00:39:59,599
Here, hon, why don't you
just use mine.

617
00:40:01,202 --> 00:40:04,872
Mr. Le Domas, Mr. Le Domas,
I just saw her running...

618
00:40:06,974 --> 00:40:08,742
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God.

619
00:40:10,878 --> 00:40:13,848
- Okay, now...
- Why does this always happen to me?

620
00:40:13,948 --> 00:40:15,483
- Come on!
- Okay. Calm down.

621
00:40:15,583 --> 00:40:16,851
Baby.

622
00:40:17,952 --> 00:40:20,653
- Yeah, okay, that's okay, honey. Come on.
- Don't be mad.

623
00:40:20,754 --> 00:40:24,158
Let's go take a walk, find you an
edible, even you out a little bit.

624
00:40:24,558 --> 00:40:28,829
Maybe we'll find the other one that's
still alive to clean that shit up.

625
00:40:29,662 --> 00:40:31,065
So, wait.

626
00:40:31,732 --> 00:40:33,200
Does the help count?

627
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:34,435
No!

628
00:40:34,535 --> 00:40:36,669
Why does everyone
keep asking that?

629
00:40:37,104 --> 00:40:39,306
We must...

630
00:40:46,747 --> 00:40:49,649
We must...

631
00:40:55,022 --> 00:40:57,358
Oh, what the fuck!

632
00:40:59,527 --> 00:41:02,630
We must kill the bride
by dawn.

633
00:41:02,730 --> 00:41:04,765
We're fucked.
I mean, we are so fucked.

634
00:41:04,865 --> 00:41:06,901
Calm down. Work the problem.

635
00:41:07,001 --> 00:41:09,870
We should use
the security cameras.

636
00:41:09,970 --> 00:41:11,772
You have no respect
for tradition.

637
00:41:11,872 --> 00:41:12,940
No, she's right.

638
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,441
Don't you think
Great-Grandfather

639
00:41:14,542 --> 00:41:16,277
would've used the security
cameras if he had them?

640
00:41:16,377 --> 00:41:18,279
I mean, it's not tradition that
he was born before cameras.

641
00:41:18,379 --> 00:41:19,580
That's... that's stupid.

642
00:41:19,679 --> 00:41:20,680
Exactly.

643
00:41:20,781 --> 00:41:22,383
Times change.

644
00:41:22,483 --> 00:41:25,486
Speaking of which, may I please
use a weapon made this century?

645
00:41:25,819 --> 00:41:27,488
- I have a gun in my purse.
- You do?

646
00:41:27,588 --> 00:41:30,157
No. No. We use Great-Grandfather's.
That's tradition.

647
00:41:30,257 --> 00:41:32,026
You pick and choose.
Pick and choose.

648
00:41:32,126 --> 00:41:34,595
At least you're not making us
wear those fucking masks.

649
00:41:34,694 --> 00:41:36,864
Oh, no. That was Dad's idea.

650
00:41:37,331 --> 00:41:38,499
It was the '80s.

651
00:41:39,166 --> 00:41:43,170
- Our reverence must not wane.
- Goddammit, Sis!

652
00:41:43,270 --> 00:41:47,908
If we don't find her and perform the
ritual before dawn, we're all dead.

653
00:41:48,008 --> 00:41:51,145
Tony,
take Daniel and turn on the cameras.

654
00:41:51,245 --> 00:41:53,981
Everyone else fan out,
and somebody find Alex.

655
00:42:32,086 --> 00:42:33,754
Jesus.

656
00:42:38,993 --> 00:42:40,861
Fucking shit. Fuck.

657
00:42:52,239 --> 00:42:53,274
Come on, Alex.

658
00:43:09,556 --> 00:43:10,824
Monitors. Monitors.

659
00:43:44,793 --> 00:43:45,826
Okay.

660
00:43:45,926 --> 00:43:47,528
Oh, shit.

661
00:43:47,628 --> 00:43:49,129
Shit, shit, shit, shit.

662
00:43:57,204 --> 00:43:59,774
Your aunt always
gets lost in the details.

663
00:43:59,873 --> 00:44:01,608
Who gives a shit
how we find her?

664
00:44:01,710 --> 00:44:03,410
Oh. I agree completely.

665
00:44:03,510 --> 00:44:04,678
Yeah.

666
00:44:04,779 --> 00:44:06,880
- Looks like we're not the only ones.
- What?

667
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:09,049
Someone turned on the cameras.

668
00:44:09,818 --> 00:44:10,851
Alex.

669
00:44:10,951 --> 00:44:14,121
Open doors.
Open fucking doors.

670
00:45:57,892 --> 00:45:59,126
Oh, fuck.

671
00:46:08,469 --> 00:46:10,003
Move.

672
00:46:14,007 --> 00:46:15,476
I'm afraid I can't do that.

673
00:46:23,718 --> 00:46:25,753
The ammunition
is display only.

674
00:46:26,888 --> 00:46:29,690
Now, did you really think
I would be stupid enough to...

675
00:46:30,859 --> 00:46:31,759
Fuck yeah!

676
00:46:36,997 --> 00:46:38,733
Open the door, Alex!

677
00:46:38,833 --> 00:46:40,501
She's in here!

678
00:46:41,703 --> 00:46:44,638
Open the goddamn door!

679
00:46:49,610 --> 00:46:51,545
Goddammit, Alex!

680
00:46:53,146 --> 00:46:54,615
Open this door!

681
00:46:57,351 --> 00:46:58,786
No, no. Hey, no!

682
00:46:58,887 --> 00:47:01,321
If you're not gonna help
us, get the hell out.

683
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:05,058
You fucking leave her alone!

684
00:47:05,158 --> 00:47:06,660
You understand me?

685
00:47:06,761 --> 00:47:08,629
- Alex!
- That's my wife!

686
00:47:08,730 --> 00:47:10,264
Hey.

687
00:47:10,732 --> 00:47:11,766
Alex.

688
00:47:12,834 --> 00:47:14,736
Alex,
you don't have to do this.

689
00:47:14,836 --> 00:47:16,069
Alex.

690
00:47:17,972 --> 00:47:20,240
Okay.

691
00:47:20,641 --> 00:47:22,109
Oh, God. Oh, God.

692
00:47:27,015 --> 00:47:28,282
I know, I know.

693
00:47:28,649 --> 00:47:30,718
- I know.
- You gotta help me. You gotta help me.

694
00:47:30,818 --> 00:47:33,353
- She's everything to me.
- I know. We'll get her out.

695
00:47:33,453 --> 00:47:35,088
- Okay, thank you. Please.
- I promise.

696
00:47:43,664 --> 00:47:46,701
- Whose side are you on?
- I distracted him, didn't I?

697
00:47:47,735 --> 00:47:48,770
Call it.

698
00:47:49,136 --> 00:47:50,738
Oh, fucking who cares?

699
00:47:51,104 --> 00:47:53,273
Tails. You take the head.

700
00:47:53,908 --> 00:47:55,375
Goddammit.

701
00:47:57,011 --> 00:48:00,380
- Wait, wait. I gotta get my gun.
- Just come back for it.

702
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:05,586
Move your ass!

703
00:48:05,686 --> 00:48:07,789
I'm carrying
the heavy part, Father.

704
00:48:07,889 --> 00:48:11,325
Years of alcohol and drug
abuse have taken a toll.

705
00:48:18,165 --> 00:48:19,633
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

706
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:22,804
- I don't understand what's going on.
- Okay. Okay.

707
00:48:22,904 --> 00:48:24,137
I need you to be quiet, okay?

708
00:48:24,237 --> 00:48:25,773
Look, I'm not even a maid.

709
00:48:26,139 --> 00:48:28,076
Mr. Le Domas,
he just likes the way I dance.

710
00:48:28,175 --> 00:48:29,811
Okay, let's swap places.

711
00:48:29,911 --> 00:48:31,045
Yeah, cause they're looking for
me, they're not looking for you.

712
00:48:31,144 --> 00:48:32,847
So, come on. Come on.

713
00:48:32,947 --> 00:48:34,214
- Please.
- She's over here!

714
00:48:34,314 --> 00:48:36,550
- She's here! She's over here!
- No, no, no, no.

715
00:48:37,684 --> 00:48:40,788
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- Ow, ow, ow!

716
00:48:42,056 --> 00:48:43,925
Help me, please.

717
00:48:44,025 --> 00:48:45,225
- Shit.
- Please.

718
00:48:54,102 --> 00:48:55,335
Shit.

719
00:49:15,123 --> 00:49:16,390
- Tony.
- Yeah?

720
00:49:16,490 --> 00:49:18,158
- What are you doing?
- Well...

721
00:49:18,258 --> 00:49:20,460
We're trying to
bring him back to us.

722
00:49:20,995 --> 00:49:22,295
Sir.

723
00:49:23,965 --> 00:49:25,198
Oh, man.

724
00:49:25,565 --> 00:49:26,566
Ow.

725
00:49:26,667 --> 00:49:29,137
I was unable to repair
the security system.

726
00:49:29,236 --> 00:49:31,438
The doors and windows
remain unlocked.

727
00:49:32,172 --> 00:49:33,473
Oh.

728
00:49:33,573 --> 00:49:36,376
And I'm afraid that
Dora has been crushed, sir.

729
00:49:36,844 --> 00:49:38,046
By the dumbwaiter.

730
00:49:38,146 --> 00:49:39,781
And then there were none.

731
00:49:40,114 --> 00:49:41,348
Jesus Christ.

732
00:49:41,448 --> 00:49:42,984
She's taking us all out.

733
00:49:43,084 --> 00:49:45,086
- How's she doing this?
- Sweetheart.

734
00:49:45,185 --> 00:49:46,754
It doesn't make sense, Becky.

735
00:49:48,321 --> 00:49:50,624
- She's a little blonde twig, and I don't...
- Tony.

736
00:49:53,293 --> 00:49:54,929
Take a minute.

737
00:49:55,029 --> 00:49:56,898
But just a minute.

738
00:49:57,497 --> 00:50:00,567
We can't let her get out.
We've got to guard the doors.

739
00:50:04,105 --> 00:50:05,873
He lost his way.

740
00:50:09,177 --> 00:50:10,945
You should never have
let him leave us.

741
00:50:11,045 --> 00:50:12,180
Excuse me?

742
00:50:12,512 --> 00:50:15,116
He and I have
always been so much alike.

743
00:50:15,215 --> 00:50:16,650
I knew the girl
would draw that card,

744
00:50:16,751 --> 00:50:18,920
and that he would face
the same choice I faced.

745
00:50:19,020 --> 00:50:20,287
Horse shit.

746
00:50:20,387 --> 00:50:22,489
None of us expected
to be doing this tonight.

747
00:50:22,924 --> 00:50:24,158
I got a tee time at eight.

748
00:50:24,257 --> 00:50:25,325
And, in case
you didn't notice,

749
00:50:25,425 --> 00:50:26,728
it wasn't much
of a choice for him.

750
00:50:26,828 --> 00:50:29,663
He's been helping her
from the get-go.

751
00:50:30,363 --> 00:50:31,833
- He hates us.
- No.

752
00:50:32,532 --> 00:50:34,836
He's simply afraid
of who he truly is.

753
00:50:34,936 --> 00:50:36,436
Like I was.

754
00:50:36,938 --> 00:50:38,940
You'll never know
how it felt that night

755
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:43,510
<i>to be told that the only man
that I'd ever loved had to die.</i>

756
00:50:43,610 --> 00:50:45,278
<i>But I should not have
fought it.</i>

757
00:50:45,378 --> 00:50:47,447
I should have
killed Charles myself.

758
00:50:48,015 --> 00:50:50,517
There's still time for Alex
to do the right thing.

759
00:50:50,617 --> 00:50:52,920
He only has to
accept the truth.

760
00:50:53,020 --> 00:50:54,956
Uh, um, what truth is that?

761
00:50:55,056 --> 00:51:00,660
That he is meant to lead
this family, not run from it.

762
00:51:01,561 --> 00:51:03,597
He's hated our
pact from the very start.

763
00:51:03,697 --> 00:51:05,398
He's the good son.
Do you remember that?

764
00:51:05,499 --> 00:51:07,501
Then why is he
the only one of us

765
00:51:07,601 --> 00:51:10,938
who has ever seen
Mr. Le Bail in his chair?

766
00:51:11,038 --> 00:51:12,639
Good God. He was five.

767
00:51:12,740 --> 00:51:14,776
He was probably,
I don't know, dreaming it.

768
00:51:14,876 --> 00:51:16,476
Or maybe he made it up.

769
00:51:19,046 --> 00:51:20,915
Well, if you say so.

770
00:52:02,757 --> 00:52:04,859
"What up, dawg?"

771
00:52:04,959 --> 00:52:06,060
Idiot.

772
00:52:06,393 --> 00:52:07,627
Not much.

773
00:52:08,461 --> 00:52:10,097
Family shit.

774
00:53:42,023 --> 00:53:43,523
Georgie?

775
00:53:45,226 --> 00:53:46,894
Oh, thank God. Okay.

776
00:53:46,994 --> 00:53:50,264
Okay, listen, I know this is
really, really scary, but...

777
00:54:43,184 --> 00:54:44,218
Fuck.

778
00:54:55,429 --> 00:54:56,663
Shit.

779
00:54:59,300 --> 00:55:00,533
Fuck.

780
00:55:47,181 --> 00:55:48,215
Fuck.

781
00:56:52,513 --> 00:56:54,614
You little fucker!

782
00:57:15,035 --> 00:57:16,170
I got you.

783
00:57:18,439 --> 00:57:20,107
I got you, bitch.

784
00:57:25,246 --> 00:57:26,280
Fuck!

785
00:57:32,119 --> 00:57:34,989
She's outside, running
towards the north fence.

786
00:57:35,623 --> 00:57:36,857
I'll get the others.

787
00:58:19,934 --> 00:58:22,403
Help me!

788
00:58:22,503 --> 00:58:24,772
Please help!

789
00:58:37,585 --> 00:58:38,953
Help. Please help me.

790
00:58:39,286 --> 00:58:40,321
Help!

791
00:58:50,331 --> 00:58:51,966
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.

792
00:58:56,370 --> 00:58:57,338
Help! Wait, stop.

793
00:58:57,438 --> 00:58:58,772
Please, please help me.

794
00:58:58,872 --> 00:59:00,374
Oh, thank God.
Thank you, thank you.

795
00:59:00,474 --> 00:59:03,043
- Get the fuck out of the road.
- Please wait.

796
00:59:05,112 --> 00:59:08,015
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

797
00:59:08,616 --> 00:59:10,384
You fucking animal.

798
00:59:10,484 --> 00:59:15,022
You piece of shit, little, tiny
dick-licker, fucking asshole, fucking I...

799
00:59:20,894 --> 00:59:22,429
Fucking rich people.

800
00:59:27,702 --> 00:59:29,069
Fuck.

801
00:59:52,693 --> 00:59:54,295
<i>She must've gone
into the woods.</i>

802
00:59:54,395 --> 00:59:56,196
<i>But don't worry, sir,
she won't get far.</i>

803
00:59:56,297 --> 00:59:57,898
<i>I'll find her.</i>

804
00:59:57,998 --> 01:00:00,034
<i>And I'll fix the fence
tomorrow.</i>

805
01:00:00,501 --> 01:00:01,402
Well...

806
01:00:03,504 --> 01:00:04,773
she's out.

807
01:00:06,507 --> 01:00:07,541
Well...

808
01:00:08,609 --> 01:00:11,045
this was fun.

809
01:00:11,445 --> 01:00:16,016
What do you say we, uh, divvy up the
wedding gifts at brunch tomorrow?

810
01:00:16,517 --> 01:00:20,321
Do you think
that this is a fucking game?

811
01:00:21,422 --> 01:00:22,456
Yes.

812
01:00:22,856 --> 01:00:24,892
Hide and seek, remember?

813
01:00:25,326 --> 01:00:32,132
Do you realize that if she lives till
dawn, that we're all gonna die?

814
01:00:34,234 --> 01:00:36,203
You all remember what happened
to the Van Horns, right?

815
01:00:36,303 --> 01:00:39,340
Um... didn't they just die
in a house fire?

816
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:41,810
Yeah, that's what
the press told you, but they...

817
01:00:42,676 --> 01:00:45,679
You don't wanna know how
they really died. Trust me.

818
01:00:45,780 --> 01:00:47,481
No, you don't
fuck Mr. Le Bail.

819
01:00:47,581 --> 01:00:49,416
Mr. Le Bail fucks you.

820
01:00:50,050 --> 01:00:52,486
You couldn't have negotiated
better terms, huh, Vic?

821
01:00:52,586 --> 01:00:54,021
You couldn't have, uh...

822
01:00:54,121 --> 01:00:56,156
Oh, I don't know,
maybe talked him down

823
01:00:56,256 --> 01:00:58,492
on the whole
eradication clause?

824
01:00:58,959 --> 01:01:00,094
Well, here's to you, fucker,

825
01:01:00,194 --> 01:01:02,429
because now
we are all fucking fucked!

826
01:01:02,529 --> 01:01:04,998
I think you made your point,
sweetheart, thank you.

827
01:01:05,632 --> 01:01:06,735
Oh, holy dick.

828
01:01:07,101 --> 01:01:09,670
Go wait for Stevens.
He might need your help.

829
01:01:09,771 --> 01:01:12,106
Not you two.
I want you out of the way.

830
01:01:12,206 --> 01:01:13,974
Take the maids
to the goat pit.

831
01:01:14,074 --> 01:01:16,944
And, pumpkin,
try not to kill anyone else.

832
01:01:17,044 --> 01:01:19,880
Cleanup duty for the fuckups.

833
01:01:19,980 --> 01:01:21,850
- No. Daddy.
- Come on, Em.

834
01:01:21,949 --> 01:01:23,283
Listen to your mother.

835
01:01:25,319 --> 01:01:29,089
Hey, hey. So, at what point
do we just cut and run?

836
01:01:29,189 --> 01:01:30,224
Right?

837
01:01:30,624 --> 01:01:32,192
I mean, come on. Right?

838
01:01:35,996 --> 01:01:37,998
Fuck you.

839
01:01:58,585 --> 01:01:59,653
Daniel!

840
01:02:00,822 --> 01:02:02,122
Daniel, help!

841
01:02:23,745 --> 01:02:25,379
Grace.

842
01:02:26,113 --> 01:02:27,381
Grace.

843
01:02:32,720 --> 01:02:34,923
Why did she have
to pull "hide and seek"?

844
01:02:35,255 --> 01:02:36,290
Do you think it's real?

845
01:02:36,390 --> 01:02:37,892
What? That we'll implode

846
01:02:38,025 --> 01:02:40,661
or burst into flames, or
whatever, if we don't kill her?

847
01:02:40,994 --> 01:02:42,162
I don't know. Can you...

848
01:02:43,630 --> 01:02:44,732
All right, I'll...

849
01:02:45,599 --> 01:02:48,635
- I need, I need you to...
- I can't. If you barf, I'll barf.

850
01:02:52,874 --> 01:02:55,810
One, two, three.

851
01:02:55,910 --> 01:02:57,211
Three.

852
01:02:59,580 --> 01:03:02,884
But you were with them the last time
they played hide and seek, weren't you?

853
01:03:02,983 --> 01:03:04,051
Were you six, seven?

854
01:03:04,151 --> 01:03:05,652
Do you remember anything?

855
01:03:05,753 --> 01:03:06,788
I remember all of it.

856
01:03:07,254 --> 01:03:08,756
Alex was with me too.

857
01:03:09,056 --> 01:03:10,257
I tried to protect him.

858
01:03:10,357 --> 01:03:12,059
I don't know what he saw
or what he remembers.

859
01:03:12,159 --> 01:03:14,127
You always looked out for him.

860
01:03:14,228 --> 01:03:17,231
If that were true, I wouldn't
have let him marry Grace.

861
01:03:19,734 --> 01:03:21,335
He deserved a better brother.

862
01:03:26,139 --> 01:03:27,709
And we all deserve to die.

863
01:03:29,777 --> 01:03:31,411
My kids don't.

864
01:03:33,915 --> 01:03:35,215
Mommy?

865
01:03:35,884 --> 01:03:37,084
Honey! Georgie.

866
01:03:37,351 --> 01:03:40,020
Are you okay?
What are you doing out here?

867
01:03:40,755 --> 01:03:41,789
I...

868
01:03:42,957 --> 01:03:44,893
I followed that lady
down here,

869
01:03:44,993 --> 01:03:47,394
and I shot her
with that gun I found.

870
01:03:48,028 --> 01:03:49,263
Why would you do that?

871
01:03:49,363 --> 01:03:50,697
That's what everyone else
was trying to do.

872
01:03:50,798 --> 01:03:52,032
Oh, sweetie.

873
01:03:52,666 --> 01:03:54,702
I am so proud of you.

874
01:04:14,421 --> 01:04:15,322
Shit.

875
01:04:35,777 --> 01:04:37,444
Come here, Grace!

876
01:04:53,828 --> 01:04:55,195
Fucking asshole!

877
01:05:11,144 --> 01:05:12,512
You motherfucker.

878
01:05:48,116 --> 01:05:49,884
<i>Thank you
for calling Trip Safe.</i>

879
01:05:49,984 --> 01:05:51,786
<i>Please stay on the line
and you'll be connected</i>

880
01:05:51,886 --> 01:05:54,154
<i>to the next available
representative.</i>

881
01:05:54,254 --> 01:05:57,257
<i>Good evening. This is
Justin. Your call may be monitored...</i>

882
01:05:57,357 --> 01:05:59,994
People are trying to kill me.
Can you please help me?

883
01:06:00,094 --> 01:06:01,695
<i>Uh, yes, I can help you
with that.</i>

884
01:06:01,796 --> 01:06:03,497
<i>Um, do you need
medical assistance, or...</i>

885
01:06:03,597 --> 01:06:05,565
Can you call the police,
please?

886
01:06:05,666 --> 01:06:07,835
<i>Yes. I'd be happy
to help you with that.</i>

887
01:06:09,971 --> 01:06:13,975
<i>Sorry. The computer's
acting up again.</i>

888
01:06:14,075 --> 01:06:16,410
<i>Let me
just quickly reboot here.</i>

889
01:06:16,510 --> 01:06:18,913
Justin,
just call the fucking police.

890
01:06:19,013 --> 01:06:22,382
<i>Ma'am, it says here that
the car was reported stolen.</i>

891
01:06:22,482 --> 01:06:24,251
<i>I'm sorry,
but I have to shut it down.</i>

892
01:06:24,351 --> 01:06:25,619
No, what?

893
01:06:25,720 --> 01:06:28,056
No, what the fuck?
Are you fucking kidding me?

894
01:06:28,156 --> 01:06:29,489
<i>It's company policy, ma'am.</i>

895
01:06:29,589 --> 01:06:31,092
- <i>There's nothing I can do.</i>
- No, no, no, please. Justin.

896
01:06:31,191 --> 01:06:33,193
<i>Just stay with the vehicle, ma'am.
Police are on their way.</i>

897
01:06:33,293 --> 01:06:34,628
Just start the fucking car!

898
01:06:34,729 --> 01:06:37,197
- <i>'Kay, there's no need for profanity.</i>
- Start the car, Justin!

899
01:06:37,297 --> 01:06:40,634
<i>Jesus, there's nothing I can do.
My hands are tied.</i>

900
01:06:48,076 --> 01:06:49,309
Justin.

901
01:06:50,044 --> 01:06:51,578
Hello? Justin!

902
01:06:51,678 --> 01:06:53,647
<i>Is there anything else
I can help you with?</i>

903
01:06:53,748 --> 01:06:55,248
Yeah, you can go
fuck yourself, Justin!

904
01:06:55,348 --> 01:06:58,886
<i>Okay. Thanks for using Trip Safe.
Have a great night.</i>

905
01:07:01,621 --> 01:07:04,025
Okay. You're okay,
you're okay, you're okay.

906
01:07:04,125 --> 01:07:05,492
Police are on the way.

907
01:07:07,661 --> 01:07:09,931
Police are on their way.
Everything's gonna be...

908
01:07:23,177 --> 01:07:24,444
Good night, Grace.

909
01:07:37,024 --> 01:07:39,426
Alex, is that you?

910
01:07:39,894 --> 01:07:41,796
Hey. Hey, you're safe now.

911
01:07:43,396 --> 01:07:44,631
We're leaving.

912
01:08:00,114 --> 01:08:01,249
<i>Where are you?</i>

913
01:08:01,348 --> 01:08:03,416
We're approaching
the rear gate, sir.

914
01:08:03,517 --> 01:08:04,986
<i>We'll be there shortly.</i>

915
01:08:05,585 --> 01:08:09,356
All right.
We are back in business.

916
01:08:32,947 --> 01:08:33,981
Tony.

917
01:08:43,456 --> 01:08:45,726
Hey, Stevens! Look behind you.

918
01:08:46,194 --> 01:08:47,427
<i>Stevens!</i>

919
01:08:49,563 --> 01:08:51,732
Turn down the fucking music,
you idiot!

920
01:08:52,867 --> 01:08:54,235
Oh.

921
01:08:58,005 --> 01:08:59,372
Oh!

922
01:09:04,111 --> 01:09:05,612
Oh, no.

923
01:09:23,030 --> 01:09:23,998
Oh, fuck.

924
01:09:24,098 --> 01:09:25,132
Fuck!

925
01:09:54,996 --> 01:09:56,030
Déjà vu.

926
01:09:57,798 --> 01:10:01,802
It's funny, I... came out here
to escape the madness.

927
01:10:04,005 --> 01:10:06,841
Thanks for crashing a car
into my tranquility.

928
01:10:09,210 --> 01:10:10,443
Daniel.

929
01:10:11,979 --> 01:10:14,949
You don't wanna kill me.
You don't want me to die.

930
01:10:16,150 --> 01:10:17,417
No, I don't.

931
01:10:17,517 --> 01:10:19,053
I like you, Grace.

932
01:10:20,021 --> 01:10:22,622
So let me go. Okay?

933
01:10:29,030 --> 01:10:30,097
I'm weak.

934
01:10:33,167 --> 01:10:34,467
You're a good guy.

935
01:10:35,036 --> 01:10:37,405
You're a really,
really, really good guy.

936
01:10:37,504 --> 01:10:39,974
And Alex, Alex loves you.

937
01:10:42,209 --> 01:10:43,677
And you love him.

938
01:10:47,547 --> 01:10:49,951
He's not gonna forgive you
if you do this.

939
01:10:51,518 --> 01:10:53,187
Maybe not.

940
01:10:53,287 --> 01:10:54,855
But at least he'll be alive.

941
01:10:55,689 --> 01:10:59,327
I can't let my entire family
die because of you.

942
01:10:59,427 --> 01:11:01,195
It's insane.

943
01:11:02,296 --> 01:11:03,764
Can't you see it's insane?

944
01:11:03,864 --> 01:11:07,500
No one's gonna die...
No one, no one is gonna die.

945
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:10,171
And you can
do something about it.

946
01:11:10,271 --> 01:11:11,772
It's bullshit!

947
01:11:12,273 --> 01:11:13,506
No.

948
01:11:13,606 --> 01:11:15,843
I am not who you think I am.

949
01:11:16,344 --> 01:11:18,045
Alex is the one who got out.

950
01:11:18,145 --> 01:11:22,883
If anyone was gonna save you,
it would've been him.

951
01:11:30,057 --> 01:11:31,726
You can come out now.

952
01:11:37,798 --> 01:11:39,699
What, you knew I was here?

953
01:11:40,500 --> 01:11:42,069
I'm drunk, I'm not blind.

954
01:11:42,502 --> 01:11:45,706
Ooh, we gotta move.
Less than an hour till dawn.

955
01:11:45,806 --> 01:11:48,209
And we still need to
prepare her for the ritual.

956
01:12:09,163 --> 01:12:10,798
Where's Grace?

957
01:12:12,500 --> 01:12:14,235
She's indisposed.

958
01:12:18,305 --> 01:12:21,075
You didn't think I was just
gonna let it happen, did you?

959
01:12:25,880 --> 01:12:28,716
With family,
one hopes for the best.

960
01:12:29,450 --> 01:12:31,085
The thing is...

961
01:12:33,254 --> 01:12:35,089
I like her.

962
01:12:36,891 --> 01:12:39,260
I don't wanna do this.

963
01:12:39,527 --> 01:12:43,798
But we have to
protect the family.

964
01:12:45,099 --> 01:12:46,133
If she dies...

965
01:12:49,136 --> 01:12:50,670
I'll kill you.

966
01:12:51,539 --> 01:12:53,941
Well...

967
01:12:54,809 --> 01:12:57,044
then I suppose
I'm dead either way.

968
01:12:57,511 --> 01:13:00,014
Yeah, and maybe it's a crock of
shit and nothing will happen.

969
01:13:00,114 --> 01:13:01,148
Oh, please.

970
01:13:01,715 --> 01:13:06,287
If you believed that, you wouldn't
have let her draw a card at all.

971
01:13:15,729 --> 01:13:17,765
Why did you leave us, Alex?

972
01:13:19,900 --> 01:13:21,402
Oh, I don't know, Mom.

973
01:13:22,002 --> 01:13:26,841
I don't know. Maybe one night when I was
chanting and slicing the throat of a goat,

974
01:13:26,941 --> 01:13:30,677
it occurred to me that that wasn't
a completely normal thing to do.

975
01:13:32,580 --> 01:13:36,150
But, and this is
what scared me the most...

976
01:13:37,785 --> 01:13:39,320
it felt normal.

977
01:13:41,422 --> 01:13:42,655
It did.

978
01:13:44,191 --> 01:13:47,995
And I realized that you'll
do pretty much anything...

979
01:13:48,095 --> 01:13:50,865
if your family says it's okay.

980
01:13:55,402 --> 01:13:56,971
And then I met Grace.

981
01:13:58,973 --> 01:14:01,308
She's the opposite
of all of you.

982
01:14:04,677 --> 01:14:06,280
She's good.

983
01:14:08,883 --> 01:14:10,918
And she made me feel
like I could be good too.

984
01:14:11,018 --> 01:14:15,956
So, if it comes down to
you or her, I choose her.

985
01:14:20,693 --> 01:14:22,229
I don't believe you.

986
01:14:24,999 --> 01:14:26,901
And I don't think
that you believe

987
01:14:27,001 --> 01:14:29,837
that a girl that you've known
for a year and a half...

988
01:14:30,738 --> 01:14:34,074
knows you better than I do.

989
01:14:51,659 --> 01:14:56,297
Our family has a very special
friend named Mr. Le Bail.

990
01:14:57,198 --> 01:15:02,570
Mr. Le Bail is the reason we
have all the nice things we have.

991
01:15:02,670 --> 01:15:08,075
<i>But sometimes Mr. Le Bail wants
something from us in return.</i>

992
01:15:08,175 --> 01:15:10,811
You got this, Fitch.

993
01:15:11,445 --> 01:15:12,780
You got this, Fitch!

994
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:14,682
Don't be a bitch, Fitch.

995
01:15:14,782 --> 01:15:17,718
Don't be a bitch, Fitch.
You got this, bitch.

996
01:15:21,388 --> 01:15:24,858
<i>I know tonight
didn't go as planned.</i>

997
01:15:24,959 --> 01:15:27,761
<i>But I'll make it right,
Mr. Le Bail.</i>

998
01:15:34,134 --> 01:15:35,169
You'll see.

999
01:16:56,016 --> 01:16:59,053
We renew our
pledge this night,

1000
01:16:59,687 --> 01:17:01,723
as our ancestors before us...

1001
01:17:02,523 --> 01:17:05,959
with this offering
of living flesh and blood.

1002
01:17:16,437 --> 01:17:17,338
Hail...

1003
01:17:24,978 --> 01:17:27,014
Brother!

1004
01:17:35,389 --> 01:17:36,791
Poisoned!

1005
01:17:36,890 --> 01:17:38,625
You son of a bitch!

1006
01:17:38,727 --> 01:17:40,227
Oh, God.

1007
01:17:46,166 --> 01:17:47,668
What did you give us?

1008
01:17:47,769 --> 01:17:50,739
Stuff we poured on the maids.
White bottle, little red cap.

1009
01:17:50,839 --> 01:17:52,473
Hydrochloric acid!

1010
01:17:53,708 --> 01:17:55,342
Come on, up and at 'em.

1011
01:18:04,753 --> 01:18:05,787
Grace!

1012
01:18:06,887 --> 01:18:09,923
- Did you... Did you just kill 'em?
- No, I just gave them a nip.

1013
01:18:10,023 --> 01:18:12,626
I Googled it. They'll shit weird
for a week, but they'll be fine.

1014
01:18:12,727 --> 01:18:15,129
- Don't worry, I'll get Alex out too.
- Find them!

1015
01:18:15,596 --> 01:18:16,997
We don't have...

1016
01:18:24,471 --> 01:18:26,140
I knew you'd help me.

1017
01:18:26,940 --> 01:18:28,008
I didn't.

1018
01:18:28,909 --> 01:18:31,945
All I knew was, at some point,
somebody had to burn it all down.

1019
01:18:32,980 --> 01:18:34,515
Never thought it'd be me.

1020
01:18:34,615 --> 01:18:36,083
Daniel.

1021
01:18:40,921 --> 01:18:43,023
Get out of the way.

1022
01:18:48,962 --> 01:18:50,197
Charity.

1023
01:18:54,034 --> 01:18:56,503
You really don't care
if I die.

1024
01:18:57,171 --> 01:18:59,106
You don't have to...

1025
01:19:16,290 --> 01:19:18,592
Daniel. Daniel. Daniel.

1026
01:19:20,762 --> 01:19:22,029
Go.

1027
01:19:23,964 --> 01:19:25,299
Thank you.

1028
01:19:25,699 --> 01:19:27,134
Thank you.

1029
01:19:33,775 --> 01:19:36,410
Where do you think
you're going, bitch?

1030
01:19:39,179 --> 01:19:41,883
Who the fuck
do you think you are?

1031
01:19:42,382 --> 01:19:45,018
Our family's
weathered worse than you.

1032
01:19:46,286 --> 01:19:49,189
You're just another sacrifice.

1033
01:19:50,123 --> 01:19:51,893
You're another goat.

1034
01:19:51,992 --> 01:19:53,460
Fuck the altar.

1035
01:19:54,027 --> 01:19:56,029
I'm gonna do it right here.

1036
01:20:08,141 --> 01:20:10,444
Grace?

1037
01:20:15,382 --> 01:20:18,585
Daniel. Daniel. Daniel.
Hey. Hey, hey.

1038
01:20:18,685 --> 01:20:22,122
Hey. Look at me. Oh, my God.
Hey, hey, look at me.

1039
01:20:29,363 --> 01:20:32,399
In my defense,
it's been a while.

1040
01:20:35,970 --> 01:20:38,272
Don't go. Don't go, okay?

1041
01:20:39,673 --> 01:20:42,777
Daniel, don't go! Don't go!
I need you, Daniel! Don't go!

1042
01:21:00,028 --> 01:21:01,495
I meant what I said this
morning.

1043
01:21:01,595 --> 01:21:03,597
I thought you were
gonna be the new me.

1044
01:21:03,697 --> 01:21:06,400
But I'm not gonna let you
hurt my family!

1045
01:21:17,144 --> 01:21:18,713
You can die.

1046
01:21:25,987 --> 01:21:28,455
You don't deserve a family.
