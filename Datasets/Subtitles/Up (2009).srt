26
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,290
{\i1}The National Explorer's Society{\i0}
{\i1}accuses Muntz{\i0}

28

00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:20,490
Mount Rushmore! Hard to starboard!


48
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:24,450
Must get Spirit ofAdventure
over Mount Rushmore!


49
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:28,620
Hold together old girl.
How're my dogs doing?


50
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:36,130
All engines ahead full!
Let's take her up to 26000 feet.


51
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:39,010
Rudders 18 degrees towards the south.


52
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:42,880
It's a beautiful day.
Winds out of the east at 10 knots.


53
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:47,470
Visibility unlimited.
Enter the weather in the logbook.


54
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:51,810
Oh! There's something down there.
I will bring it back for science.


55
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:58,610
Aw! It's a puppy! Ah! No time!
A storm! Lightning. Hail.


56
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:00,150
-What are you doing?
-Ahhh!


57
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:03,150
Don't you know
this is an exclusive club?


58
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,200
Only explorers get in here


59
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,200
not just any kid off the street
with a helmet and a pair of goggles.


60
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:12,200
Do you think you've got what it takes?
Well do you?


61
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:16,040
All right you're in. Welcome aboard.


62
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:20,050
What's wrong? Can't you talk?


63
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:24,550
Hey I don't bite.


64
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:31,430
You and me we're in a club now.


65
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,270
I saw where your balloon went.
Come on. Let's go get it.


66
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:42,230
My name's Ellie.


67
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:46,910
There it is.


68
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:53,000
Well go ahead.


69
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,420
Go on.


70
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:20,900
Ow.


71
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,320
Hey kid!


72
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,650
Thought you might need
a little cheering up.


73
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:27,570
I got something to show you.


74
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:32,280
I am about to let you
see something


75
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:35,120
I have never shown
to another human being.


76
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:37,580
Ever! In my life!


77
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:41,880
You'll have to swear
you will not tell anyone.


78
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:45,260
Cross your heart. Do it!


79
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:50,180
My Adventure Book.


80
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:53,470
You know him.


81
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:57,230
Charles Muntz explorer.


82
00:05:57,310 --> 00:06:00,350
When I get big
I'm going where he's going


83
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:06,030
South America.
It's like America but south.


84
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,700
Wanna know where I'm gonna live?


85
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:13,660
"Paradise Falls a land lost in time."


86
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:18,040
I ripped this right out of a library book.


87
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:22,790
I'm gonna move my clubhouse there
and park it right next to the falls.


88
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:25,500
Who knows what lives up there.


89
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:27,720
And once I get there?


90
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:31,760
Well I'm saving these pages for
all the adventures I'm gonna have.


91
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:37,730
Only I just don't know
how I'm gonna get to Paradise Falls.


92
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:47,530
That's it!
You can take us there in a blimp!


93
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:50,570
Swear you'll take us! Cross your heart!


94
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:55,700
Cross it! Cross your heart!
Good you promised. No backing out.


95
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:59,250
Well see you tomorrow kid. Bye!


96
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:03,330
Adventure is out there!


97
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:07,170
You know you don't talk very much.


98
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:09,380
I like you!


99
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:13,220
Wow.


100
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:01,550
Hah!


101
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,190
Stevie throw me a deuce!


102
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:44,400
Quite a sight huh Ellie?


103
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:50,240
Uh! Mail's here.


104
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:07,550
Shady Oaks Retirement.
Oh brother.


105
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:10,760
Hmm...


106
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:19,980
Hey! Morning Mr. Fredricksen.
Need any help there?


107
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,940
No. Yes!


108
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,190
Tell your boss over there
that you boys are ruining our house.


109
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,780
Well just to let you know


110
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:30,450
my boss will be happy to take
this old place off your hands


111
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:32,950
and for double his last offer!


112
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,240
What do you say to that?


113
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,830
Uh I take that as a "no" then?


114
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:42,290
I believe I made my position
to your boss quite clear.


115
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,920
You poured prune juice in his gas tank.


116
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,170
Yeah that was good.
Here let me talk to him.


117
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:55,850
{\i1}You in the suit.{\i0}
{\i1}Yes you. Take a bath hippie!{\i0}


118
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:58,350
{\i1}l am not with him!{\i0}


119
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:02,020
This is serious!
He's out to get your house.


120
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:05,110
Tell your boss
he can have our house.


121
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:07,650
-Really?
-When I'm dead!


122
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:11,490
I'll take that as a maybe.


123
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,820

126
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:27,630
"Good afternoon. My name is Russell.


127
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:33,010
"And I am a Wilderness Explorer
in Tribe 54 Sweat Lodge 12.


128
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:36,140
"Are you in need
of any assistance today sir?"


129
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:37,260
No.


130
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:40,520
-I could help you cross the street.
-No.


131
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:44,560
-I could help you cross your yard.
-No.


132
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:48,320
-I could help you cross your porch.
-No.


133
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:50,740
Well I gotta help you cross something.


134
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:52,860
No. I'm doing fine.


135
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,660
"Good afternoon. My name is Russell."


136
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:03,870
-Kid... Kid.
-"And I am a Wilderness Explorer


137
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,550
-"in Tribe 54 Sweat Lodge 12."
-I... Slow down. Kid!


138
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:10,880
-"Are you in need of any assistance..."
-Thank you


139
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:12,510
-but I don't need any help!
-"...today sir?"


140
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,390
Ow.


141
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,060
Proceed.


142
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:24,440
-"Good afternoon..."
-But skip to the end!


143
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:29,360
See these? These are
my Wilderness Explorer badges.


144
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:34,570
You may notice one is missing.
It's my Assisting the Elderly badge.


145
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:39,370
If I get it I will become
a Senior Wilderness Explorer.


146
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:42,080
"The wilderness must be explored!"


147
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,250
Caw caw! Raar!


148
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:48,130
It's gonna be great!
There's a big ceremony


149
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:51,710
and all the dads come
and they pin on our badges.


150
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,760
So you want to assist an old person?


151
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:57,260
Yep! Then I'll be
a Senior Wilderness Explorer.


152
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:01,600
-You ever heard of a snipe?
-Snipe?


153
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:03,680
Bird. Beady eyes.


154
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:07,770
Every night it sneaks in my yard
and gobbles my poor azaleas.


155
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:13,570
I'm elderly and infirm. I can't catch it.
If only someone could help me.


156
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:17,070
-Me me! I'll do it!
-I don't know. It's awfully crafty.


157
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:20,120
You'd have to clap your hands
three times to lure it in.


158
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,990
I'll find him Mr. Fredricksen!


159
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:24,450
I think its burrow is two blocks down.
If you go past...


160
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:27,620
Two blocks down. Got it! Snipe.


161
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:30,540
Here snipey snipey.


162
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:32,300
Bring it back here when you find it.


163
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:33,460
Snipe!


164
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:34,670
Okay keep her coming.
Keep coming.


165
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:39,800
And stop. Stop. Stop!


166
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:44,520
Why... Hey! Hey you!


167
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,100
What do you...
What do you think you're doing?


168
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:48,650
-I am so sorry sir.
-Don't touch that!


169
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:50,270
No no no.
Let me take care of that for you.


170
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,440
-Get away from our mailbox!
-Hey. Sir I...


171
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:54,030
I don't want you to touch it!


172
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:55,150
Ow!


173
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Steve you all right?


174
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:44,200
Sorry Mr. Fredricksen.


175
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:48,540
You don't seem like
a public menace to me. Take this.


176
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:52,710
The guys from Shady Oaks will be by
to pick you up in the morning okay?


177
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:09,020
What do I do now Ellie?


178
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:40,440
Morning gentlemen.


179
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:43,490
Good morning Mr. Fredricksen.
You ready to go?


180
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:46,700
Ready as I'll ever be.


181
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:49,120
Would you do me a favor
and take this?


182
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,540
I'll meet you at the van in just a minute.


183
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:55,960
I wanna say one last goodbye
to the old place.


184
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:58,840
Sure. Take all the time you need sir.


185
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:05,430
That's typical. He's probably
going to the bathroom for the 80th time.


186
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:09,180
You think he'd take better
care of his house.


187
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:55,480
So long boys! I'll send you a postcard
from Paradise Falls!


188
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:44,770
Heh!


189
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:26,230
We're on our way Ellie.


190
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:14,160
Huh?


191
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:20,330
Hmm.


192
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:39,390
Hi Mr. Fredricksen. It's me Russell.


193
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:41,470
What are you doing out here kid?


194
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:45,310
I found the snipe
and I followed it under your porch


195
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:50,230
but this snipe had a long tail
and looked more like a large mouse.


196
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:57,740
Please let me in.


197
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,410
No.


198
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,170
Oh alright you can come...


199
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:08,580
...in.


200
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:15,380
Huh.


201
00:25:18,010 --> 00:25:20,600
I've never been
in a floating house before.


202
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:26,230
Goggles. Look at this stuff.
Wow! You're going on a trip?


203
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:30,020
"Paradise Falls a land lost in time."


204
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:31,860
You're going to South America
Mr. Fredricksen?


205
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:33,780
Don't touch that! You'll soil it.


206
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,950
You know most people take a plane


207
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:39,370
but you're smart because you will
have all your TV and clocks and stuff.


208
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:42,370
Whoa.
Is this how you steer your house?


209
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:43,870
Does it really work?


210
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,370
Kid would you stop with the...


211
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:48,040
-This makes it go right.
-Let go of that...


212
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:50,630
-And that way's left.
-Knock it off!


213
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:52,750
Hey look! Buildings.


214
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:56,760
That building's so close
I could almost touch it.


215
00:25:59,970 --> 00:26:02,100
Wow! This is great!


216
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:04,640
You should try this Mr. Fredricksen.


217
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:08,140
Look there's a bus that could
take me home two blocks away!


218
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:10,770
Hey! I can see your house from here.


219
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,650
Don't jerk around so much kid. Whoa!


220
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:17,320
Well that's not gonna work.


221
00:26:17,490 --> 00:26:20,660
I know that cloud. It's a cumulonimbus.


222
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:21,820
Did you know that


223
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,580
the cumulonimbus forms


224
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,160
when warm air rises over cool air?


225
00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:28,580
Stayed up all night
blowing up balloons...for what?


226
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:29,750
...and that's how we get lightning.


227
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:31,250
-That's nice kid.
-Mr. Fredricksen?


228
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:34,500
There's a storm coming.
It's starting to get scary.


229
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:38,260
We're gonna get blown to bits!
We're in big trouble...


230
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:42,180
-What are you doing over there?
-Look.


231
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,980
See? Cumulonimbus.


232
00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:33,060
My pack!


233
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:39,240
Got ya!


234
00:28:16,610 --> 00:28:18,230
I thought you were dead.


235
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,360
What happened?


236
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:25,870
I steered us. I did. I steered the house.


237
00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:27,030
Steered us?


238
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,870
After you tied your stuff down
you took a nap.


239
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:32,040
So I went ahead
and steered us down here.


240
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:33,830
Yeah. Sure.


241
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,800
Can't tell where we are.


242
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:50,890
Oh we're in South America all right.


243
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:54,640
It was a cinch
with my Wilderness Explorer GPS.


244
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:57,400
-GP... What?
-My dad gave it to me.


245
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,820
It shows exactly where we are
on the planet.


246
00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:04,650
With this baby we'll never be lost!


247
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,330
Oops.


248
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:14,250
We'll get you down find a bus stop


249
00:29:14,330 --> 00:29:17,420
you just tell the man
you wanna go back to your mother.


250
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:21,170
Sure but I don't think
they have buses in Paradise Falls.


251
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:26,680
There. That ought to do it.


252
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,590
Here I'll give you
some change for bus fare.


253
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:31,180
No I'll just use
my city bus pass.


254
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:34,930
Whoa. That's gonna be
like a billion transfers


255
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:36,690
to get back to my house.


256
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:46,110
Mr. Fredricksen how much longer?


257
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:50,030
Well we're up pretty high.
Could take hours to get down.


258
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:54,450
That thing was... building or something.


259
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,960
What was that Mr. Fredricksen?


260
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:00,380
We can't be close to the ground yet.


261
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:12,220
Wait! Wait no don't! Don't don't!


262
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:15,020
Wait wait. Wait!


263
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:23,190
-Russell hang on! Hey!
-Whoa! Whoa!


264
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:33,200
Aaaagggghhhhh!


265
00:30:33,410 --> 00:30:34,910
-Walk back. Walk back.
-Okay.


266
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,830
Come on. Come on.


267
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:52,260
Where... Where are we?


268
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:57,100
This doesn't look like the city
or the jungle Mr. Fredricksen.


269
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:01,940
Don't worry Ellie. I got it.


270
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:28,760
There it is.


271
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:59,330
Ellie it's so beautiful.


272
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:03,250
We made it.


273
00:32:03,330 --> 00:32:08,090
We made it! Russell! We could float
right over there! Climb up. Climb up!


274
00:32:08,170 --> 00:32:09,590
You mean assist you?


275
00:32:09,670 --> 00:32:11,920
-Yeah yeah. Whatever.
-Okay. I'll climb up.


276
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:19,680
Watch it!
Sorry.


277
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:31,150
Now when you get up there
go ahead and hoist me up!


278
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:33,490
Got it?


279
00:32:37,490 --> 00:32:39,290
You on the porch yet?


280
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,710
What? That's it?


281
00:32:48,170 --> 00:32:53,380
I came all this way just to get stuck
at the wrong end of this rock pile?


282
00:32:55,050 --> 00:32:56,140
Great.


283
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:04,890
Hey if I could assist you over there
would you sign off on my badge?


284
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:10,150
-What are you talking about?
-We could walk your house to the falls.


285
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:13,820
-Walk it?
-Yeah! After all we weigh it down.


286
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:17,240
We could walk it right over there.
Like a parade balloon.


287
00:33:21,410 --> 00:33:24,830
Now we're gonna walk
to the falls quickly and quietly


288
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:27,540
-with no rap music or flashdancing.
-Uh-huh.


289
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:32,420
We have three days at best before
the helium leaks out of those balloons.


290
00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:35,010
And if we're not at the falls
when that happens...


291
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:37,430
-Sand.
-...we're not getting to the falls.


292
00:33:37,510 --> 00:33:39,390
I found sand!


293
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:43,930
Don't you worry Ellie.
We'll get our house over there.


294
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,940
This is fun already isn't it?


295
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:54,900
By the time we get there
you're gonna feel so assisted.


296
00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:58,610
Oh Mr. Fredricksen
if we happen to get separated


297
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:00,870
use the Wilderness Explorer call.


298
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:02,950
Caw caw! Raar!


299
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,870
Wait. Why are we going
to Paradise Falls again?


300
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,040
Hey let's play a game.


301
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:12,380
It's called
"see who can be quiet the longest."


302
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:15,300
Cool!
My mom loves that game!


303
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:19,150
Darn thing!


304
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:22,870
Come on Russell.
Would you hurry it up?


305
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:27,200
I'm tired. And my knee hurts.


306
00:35:27,450 --> 00:35:28,830
Which knee?


307
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:33,880
My elbow hurts
and I have to go to the bathroom.


308
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,710
I asked you about that five minutes ago.


309
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:40,010
Well I didn't have to go then!


310
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:46,470
I don't wanna walk
anymore. Can we stop?


311
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:49,640
Russell if you don't hurry up
the tigers will eat you.


312
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:54,190
There are no tigers in South America.
Zoology.


313
00:35:55,730 --> 00:35:59,490
Oh for the love of Pete! Go on into
the bushes and do your business.


314
00:35:59,570 --> 00:36:01,740
Okay! Here! Hold my stuff.


315
00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:06,370
I've always wanted to try this.


316
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:11,580
Mr. Fredricksen


317
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:14,670
am I supposed to dig the hole
before or after?


318
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,340
None of my concern!


319
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:20,920
Oh. It's before!


320
00:36:21,010 --> 00:36:22,590
Bah!
La la la la la!


321
00:36:26,010 --> 00:36:27,050
Huh?


322
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:30,350
Tracks?


323
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:32,680
Snipe.


324
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:38,230
Here snipe. Come on out snipe.


325
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,030
Snipe.


326
00:36:42,110 --> 00:36:43,200
Huh?


327
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:03,550
Ha! Gotcha! Don't be afraid little snipe.


328
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:08,300
I am a Wilderness Explorer
so I'm a friend to all of nature.


329
00:37:08,890 --> 00:37:10,600
Want some more?


330
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:17,270
Hi boy. Don't eat it all. Come on out.


331
00:37:19,150 --> 00:37:23,820
Come on. Come on.
Don't be afraid little snipe.


332
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:28,570
Nice snipe. Good little snipe. Nice...


333
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:31,580
Giant snipe.


334
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:39,500
-I found the snipe!
-Oh! Did you?


335
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:42,130
-Are they tall?
-Oh yes they're very tall.


336
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:45,260
-Do they have a lot of colors?
-They do indeed!


337
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:49,090
-Do they like chocolate?
-Oh yes... chocolate?


338
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:54,680
-Gah! What is that thing?
-It's a snipe!


339
00:37:54,770 --> 00:37:56,770
There's no such thing as a snipe!


340
00:37:56,850 --> 00:37:59,610
-But you said snipes eat your... Whoa!
-Hey!


341
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:03,690
Go on! Get out of here! Go on!


342
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:10,320
Whoa!


343
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,620
Whoa!


344
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:15,700
Careful Russell!


345
00:38:15,830 --> 00:38:19,710
Hey look Mr. Fredricksen.
It likes me. Whoa!


346
00:38:20,210 --> 00:38:23,050
-Russell!
-No stop! That tickles.


347
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:26,300
Get out of here! Go on! Get!


348
00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:38,480
Uh-oh. No no no! Kevin!
It's okay. Mr. Fredricksen is nice.


349
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:41,730
-Kevin?
-Yeah. That's his name I just gave him.


350
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:47,070
Beat it! Vamoose! Scram!
Hey! That's mine!


351
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,580
Shoo! Shoo! Get out of here!


352
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:56,330
Go on! Beat it!


353
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:02,920
Can we keep him? Please?


354
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,920
I'll get the food for him. I'll walk him.
I'll change his newspapers.


355
00:39:07,010 --> 00:39:08,090
No.


356
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:13,430
"An Explorer is a friend to all
be it plants or fish or tiny mole."


357
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:16,270
-That doesn't even rhyme.
-Yeah it does.


358
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:19,270
-Hey look. Kevin.
-What?


359
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:23,440
Get down! You're not allowed up there!


360
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:28,280
You come down here right now!


361
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,450
Sheesh!


362
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:34,620
Can you believe this Ellie?


363
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:35,780
Ellie?


364
00:39:36,790 --> 00:39:39,540
Hey Ellie! Could I keep the bird?


365
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:42,460
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.


366
00:39:43,210 --> 00:39:44,880
She said for you to let me.


367
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,800
But I told him no. I told you no!


368
00:39:47,130 --> 00:39:48,300
N-O.


369
00:40:00,810 --> 00:40:02,480
I see you back there.


370
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:08,320
Go on! Get out of here! Shoo!
Go annoy someone else for a while.


371
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,990
Hey are you okay over there?


372
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:16,240
Uh... Hello?


373
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:21,620
Oh!


374
00:40:21,830 --> 00:40:24,420
Hello sir! Thank goodness.


375
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:26,920
It's nice to know
someone else is up here.


376
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,800
I can smell you.


377
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:32,510
What? You can smell us?


378
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:35,970
I can smell you.


379
00:40:43,270 --> 00:40:44,350
Hey.


380
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:46,860
You were talking to a rock.


381
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:50,030
Hey that one looks like a turtle.


382
00:40:50,110 --> 00:40:53,110
Look at that one!
That one looks like a dog.


383
00:40:54,530 --> 00:40:56,530
-It is a dog!
-What?


384
00:40:57,450 --> 00:41:00,540
We're not allowed to have dogs
in my apartment.


385
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,210
Hey I like dogs.


386
00:41:04,330 --> 00:41:05,960
We have your dog!


387
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:08,380
-Whoa!
-Wonder who he belongs to.


388
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:12,050
Sit boy. Hey look he's trained. Shake.


389
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:13,470
Uh-huh.


390
00:41:13,550 --> 00:41:14,550
-Speak.
-Hi there.


391
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:18,550
Did that dog just say "Hi there"?


392
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:19,850
Oh yes.


393
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:23,980
My name is Dug.
I have just met you and I love you.


394
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:28,400
My master made me this collar.
He is a good and smart master


395
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:32,030
and he made me this collar
so that I may talk. Squirrel!


396
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:35,240
My master is good and smart.


397
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,410
It's not possible.


398
00:41:36,530 --> 00:41:38,990
Oh it is
because my master is smart.


399
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:41,080
-Cool! What do these do boy?
-Hey would you...


400
00:41:42,330 --> 00:41:43,410
I use that collar...


401
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:46,920
...to talk with.
I would be happy if you stopped.


402
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:50,420
Russell don't touch that!
It could be radioactive or something!


403
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:51,840
I am a great tracker.


404
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:55,010
My pack sent me on a special mission
all by myself.


405
00:41:55,090 --> 00:41:56,170
Have you seen a bird?


406
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:58,510
I want to find one
and I've been on the scent.


407
00:41:58,590 --> 00:42:00,760
I am a great tracker.
Did I mention that?


408
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:03,600
Hey that is the bird.


409
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:06,600
I have never seen one up close
but this is the bird.


410
00:42:06,730 --> 00:42:09,190
May I take your bird back to camp
as my prisoner?


411
00:42:09,270 --> 00:42:13,280
Yes yes take it. And on the way
learn how to bark like a real dog.


412
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,440
I can bark.


413
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:16,780
And here's howling.


414
00:42:20,950 --> 00:42:23,540
Can we keep him?
Please please please!


415
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:26,790
-No.
-But it's a talking dog!


416
00:42:26,910 --> 00:42:30,460
It's just a weird trick or something.
Let's get to the falls.


417
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:31,960
Please be my prisoner.


418
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:34,630
Oh please oh please be my prisoner!


419
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:40,640
Oh! Here it is.
I picked up the bird's scent!


420
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:43,050
Wait a minute wait a minute!
What is this?


421
00:42:43,390 --> 00:42:44,970
Chocolate. I smell chocolate.


422
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:49,560
I'm getting prunes
and denture cream! Who are they?


423
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:51,980
Oh man
Master will not be pleased.


424
00:42:52,110 --> 00:42:55,110
We better tell him someone
took the bird. Right Alpha?


425
00:42:56,820 --> 00:42:57,900
{\i1}No.{\i0}


426
00:42:57,990 --> 00:43:00,820
{\i1}Soon enough the bird{\i0}
{\i1}will be ours yet again.{\i0}


427
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:02,990
{\i1}Find the scent my compadres{\i0}


428
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:04,830
{\i1}and you too shall{\i0}
{\i1}have much rewardings{\i0}


429
00:43:04,950 --> 00:43:07,660
{\i1}from Master for the toil factor{\i0}
{\i1}you wage.{\i0}


430
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:11,420
Hey Alpha I think there's
something wrong with your collar.


431
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:12,750
You must've bumped it.


432
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:15,130
Yeah
your voice sounds funny!


433
00:43:18,670 --> 00:43:23,010
{\i1}Beta! Gamma!{\i0}
{\i1}Mayhaps you desire to... Squirrel!{\i0}


434
00:43:25,010 --> 00:43:27,100
{\i1}Mayhaps you desire{\i0}
{\i1}to challenge the ranking{\i0}


435
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:29,770
{\i1}that I have been assigned{\i0}
{\i1}by my strength and cunning.{\i0}


436
00:43:29,850 --> 00:43:33,650
No no no. But maybe
Dug would. You might wanna ask him.


437
00:43:34,610 --> 00:43:39,570
Yeah. I wonder if he's found
the bird on his very special mission.


438
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:41,740
{\i1}Do not mention Dug{\i0}
{\i1}to me at this time.{\i0}


439
00:43:42,070 --> 00:43:47,080
{\i1}His fooI's errand will keep him{\i0}
{\i1}most occupied. Most occupied indeed.{\i0}


440
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:52,210
{\i1}Do you not agree with that{\i0}
{\i1}which I am saying to you now?{\i0}


441
00:43:52,290 --> 00:43:56,590
Sure but the second Master
finds out you sent Dug out by himself


442
00:43:56,670 --> 00:43:58,260
none of us will get a treat.


443
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:01,470
{\i1}You are wise{\i0}
{\i1}my trusted Iieutenant.{\i0}


444
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:05,850
{\i1}This is AIpha calling Dug.{\i0}
{\i1}Come in Dug.{\i0}


445
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:08,770
{\i1}Hi Alpha.{\i0}
{\i1}Hey your voice sounds funny.{\i0}


446
00:44:08,850 --> 00:44:11,940
{\i1}I know I know!{\i0}
{\i1}Have you seen the bird?{\i0}


447
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:14,770
{\i1}Why yes.{\i0}
{\i1}The bird is my prisoner now.{\i0}


448
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:16,310
Yeah right!


449
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:20,110
{\i1}ImpossibIe! Where are you?{\i0}


450
00:44:20,190 --> 00:44:21,610
{\i1}I am here with the bird{\i0}


451
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:24,450
{\i1}and I will bring it back{\i0}
{\i1}and then you will Iike me.{\i0}


452
00:44:24,530 --> 00:44:26,950
{\i1}-Gotta go.{\i0}
{\i1}-Hey Dug who you taIking to?{\i0}


453
00:44:27,030 --> 00:44:28,950
{\i1}No wait wait!{\i0}
What's Dug doing?


454
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:30,870
Why's he with
that small mailman?


455
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:32,580
Where are they?


456
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,960
{\i1}There he is. Come on!{\i0}


457
00:44:41,590 --> 00:44:44,300
Oh please oh please
oh please be my prisoner.


458
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:45,800
Dug stop bothering Kevin!


459
00:44:45,890 --> 00:44:47,800
That man there says
I can take the bird


460
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:50,640
and I love that man there
like he is my master.


461
00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:51,810
I am not your master!


462
00:44:51,890 --> 00:44:53,440
I am warning you
once again bird.


463
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:55,520
-Hey! Quit it!
-I am jumping on you now bird.


464
00:44:55,610 --> 00:44:57,900
Russell at this rate
we'll never get to the falls.


465
00:44:57,980 --> 00:44:59,320
Here bird.


466
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:09,200
I am nobody's master got it?


467
00:45:09,290 --> 00:45:11,750
I don't want you here
and I don't want you here!


468
00:45:11,830 --> 00:45:13,120
I'm stuck with you!


469
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:15,870
And if you two don't clear out of here
by the time I count to three...


470
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:18,500
A ball! Oh boy oh boy!
A ball!


471
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:22,010
Ball? Yeah yeah? You want it boy?


472
00:45:22,670 --> 00:45:23,970
Huh? Huh? Yeah. Yeah?


473
00:45:24,050 --> 00:45:26,090
Yes I do!
I do ever so want the ball.


474
00:45:26,180 --> 00:45:27,640
-Go get it!
-Oh boy! Oh boy!


475
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:29,550
I will get it and then bring it back!


476
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:31,180
Quick Russell.
Give me some chocolate.


477
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:33,310
-Why?
-Just give it to me!


478
00:45:33,770 --> 00:45:35,140
Bird. Bird!


479
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:39,310
Come on Russell.


480
00:45:39,650 --> 00:45:42,030
Wait. Wait Mr. Fredricksen.


481
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:48,950
What are we doing?


482
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:58,170
Hey we're pretty far now.
Kevin's gonna miss me.


483
00:46:03,710 --> 00:46:05,800
I think that did the trick.


484
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:09,050
Hi Master.


485
00:46:09,890 --> 00:46:11,220
Afternoon.


486
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:39,920
Well thanks for keeping us
dry anyway Ellie.


487
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,880
Which one's the front?


488
00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:44,750
Oh boy.


489
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:48,550
Is this step three or step five?


490
00:46:50,850 --> 00:46:52,100
There.


491
00:46:56,060 --> 00:46:58,390
All done! That's for you.


492
00:47:04,730 --> 00:47:05,820
Oh...


493
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:07,400
Tents are hard.


494
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:13,200
Wait. Aren't you super wilderness guy
with the GPMs and the badges?


495
00:47:13,910 --> 00:47:18,000
Yeah but can I tell you a secret?


496
00:47:18,580 --> 00:47:21,420
-No.
-All right. Here it goes.


497
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,460
I never actually built a tent before.
There I said it.


498
00:47:26,050 --> 00:47:28,170
You've been camping before
haven't you?


499
00:47:28,260 --> 00:47:30,720
Well never outside.


500
00:47:31,220 --> 00:47:34,640
Well why didn't you ask your dad
how to build a tent?


501
00:47:35,100 --> 00:47:37,930
I don't think he wants
to talk about this stuff.


502
00:47:38,020 --> 00:47:40,640
Well why don't you try him sometime.
Maybe he'll surprise you.


503
00:47:40,730 --> 00:47:43,060
Well he's away a lot.
I don't see him much.


504
00:47:43,150 --> 00:47:44,770
He's gotta be home sometime.


505
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:49,110
Well I call but Phyllis told me
I bug him too much.


506
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:52,610
Phyllis? You call your own mother
by her first name?


507
00:47:53,070 --> 00:47:54,870
Phyllis isn't my mom.


508
00:47:57,120 --> 00:47:58,160
Oh.


509
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:09,420
But he promised
he'd come to my Explorer ceremony


510
00:48:09,510 --> 00:48:12,300
to pin on
my Assisting the Elderly badge.


511
00:48:13,590 --> 00:48:16,510
So he can show me
about tents then right?


512
00:48:23,060 --> 00:48:25,690
Hey why don't you get some sleep?


513
00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:29,610
Don't wanna wake up
the traveling flea circus.


514
00:48:31,650 --> 00:48:33,150
Mr. Fredricksen?


515
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:36,120
Dug says he wants
to take Kevin prisoner.


516
00:48:36,990 --> 00:48:38,950
We have to protect him.


517
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:43,210
Can Kevin go with us?


518
00:48:44,830 --> 00:48:46,750
All right he can come.


519
00:48:47,420 --> 00:48:49,550
Promise you won't leave him?


520
00:48:50,050 --> 00:48:52,170
-Yeah.
-Cross your heart?


521
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:02,270
Cross my heart.


522
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:10,320
What have I got myself into Ellie?


523
00:49:33,510 --> 00:49:35,260
Morning sweetheart.


524
00:49:37,430 --> 00:49:39,010
We better get moving.


525
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:43,060
Bird's gone.


526
00:49:43,140 --> 00:49:46,730
Maybe Russell won't notice.
All right everybody up!


527
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:52,030
Where's Kevin? He's wandered off!
Kevin! Dug find Kevin!


528
00:49:52,110 --> 00:49:55,950
Find the bird find the bird!
Hi hi. Point!


529
00:49:56,030 --> 00:49:57,910
Look. There he is!


530
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:01,490
Point!


531
00:50:01,870 --> 00:50:05,540
Hey! That's my food! Get off my roof!


532
00:50:05,620 --> 00:50:06,870
Yeah get off of his...


533
00:50:12,460 --> 00:50:13,550
What is it doing?


534
00:50:13,630 --> 00:50:16,050
The bird is calling to her babies.


535
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:18,640
Her babies.


536
00:50:20,010 --> 00:50:21,550
Kevin's a girl?


537
00:50:23,930 --> 00:50:26,680
Her house is over there
in those twisty rocks.


538
00:50:27,770 --> 00:50:31,360
She has been gathering food for
her babies and must get back to them.


539
00:50:32,610 --> 00:50:34,280
Wait. Kevin's just leaving?


540
00:50:36,860 --> 00:50:39,360
But you promised to protect her.


541
00:50:39,450 --> 00:50:42,740
Her babies need her.
We gotta make sure they're together!


542
00:50:42,830 --> 00:50:45,870
Sorry Russell.
We've lost enough time already.


543
00:50:47,330 --> 00:50:48,460
Yeah.


544
00:50:56,130 --> 00:50:58,840
This was her favorite chocolate.


545
00:50:59,470 --> 00:51:03,510
Because you sent her away
there's more for you.


546
00:51:05,180 --> 00:51:06,220
Huh?


547
00:51:06,310 --> 00:51:07,480
Kevin?


548
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:29,080
{\i1}Where's the bird?{\i0}
{\i1}You said you had the bird.{\i0}


549
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:30,370
Oh yes. Oh yes.


550
00:51:30,460 --> 00:51:33,500
Since I have said that
I can see how you would think that.


551
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:36,670
{\i1}Where is it?{\i0}
Uh... Tomorrow.


552
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:40,630
Come back tomorrow and then
I will again have the bird. Yes.


553
00:51:41,890 --> 00:51:45,560
{\i1}You lost it!{\i0}
{\i1}Why do I not have a surprised feeIing?{\i0}


554
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:49,350
{\i1}Well at Ieast you now have Ied us{\i0}
{\i1}to the small mailman{\i0}


555
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:51,940
{\i1}and the one who smells of prunes.{\i0}


556
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:56,110
{\i1}Master will be most pIeased{\i0}
{\i1}we have found them{\i0}


557
00:51:56,190 --> 00:51:59,110
{\i1}and will ask of them many questions.{\i0}
{\i1}Come!{\i0}


558
00:51:59,190 --> 00:52:02,740
Wait. We're not going with you!
We're going to the falls!


559
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:06,370
Get away from me!


560
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:11,500
Get down!


561
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:06,930
Stay!


562
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:17,730
You came here in that?


563
00:53:18,230 --> 00:53:19,480
Uh yeah.


564
00:53:20,230 --> 00:53:24,070
In a house? A floating house?


565
00:53:32,580 --> 00:53:35,410
That is the darnedest thing
I've ever seen.


566
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,540
You're not after my bird are you?


567
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:41,500
But if you needed to borrow
a cup of sugar


568
00:53:41,590 --> 00:53:43,840
I'd be happy to oblige.


569
00:53:47,220 --> 00:53:49,800
Well this is all a misunderstanding.


570
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:52,100
My dogs made a mistake.


571
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:55,100
Wait. Are you Charles Muntz?


572
00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:57,810
Yeah well yes.


573
00:53:57,900 --> 00:54:00,020
THE Charles Muntz?


574
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:02,320
"Adventure is out there!"


575
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:05,950
It's really him! That's Charles Muntz!


576
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:09,620
-It is? Who's Charles Muntz?
-Him!


577
00:54:09,700 --> 00:54:11,530
-Yes! Yes! That's him!
-I'm Carl Fredricksen.


578
00:54:11,620 --> 00:54:14,450
My wife and I
we were your biggest fans.


579
00:54:14,540 --> 00:54:16,290
Oh well. You're a man of good taste.


580
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:20,790
Now you must be tired. Hungry?


581
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:21,920
Uh-huh.


582
00:54:22,130 --> 00:54:23,460
Now attention everyone!


583
00:54:23,550 --> 00:54:27,380
These people are no longer intruders!
They are our guests.


584
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:31,970
Follow me.
I like you temporarily.


585
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:33,760
You do smell like prunes.


586
00:54:33,850 --> 00:54:34,890
Whoa!


587
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:37,640
I will not bite you.


588
00:54:37,730 --> 00:54:40,190
The small mailman
smells like chocolate.


589
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:43,610
I'm sorry about the dogs.


590
00:54:43,690 --> 00:54:46,690
-Hope they weren't too rough on you.
-We weren't.


591
00:54:46,780 --> 00:54:50,240
Go ahead and moor
your airship right next to mine.


592
00:54:55,870 --> 00:54:59,460
We're not actually going inside
the Spirit ofAdventure itself?


593
00:54:59,540 --> 00:55:00,580
Oh...


594
00:55:00,830 --> 00:55:02,420
Would you like to?


595
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:03,750
Would I?


596
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:07,760
Wait up Mr. Muntz.


597
00:55:08,590 --> 00:55:10,130
Jiminy Cricket.


598
00:55:10,470 --> 00:55:12,510
Not you.
What do we do with Dug?


599
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:16,350
{\i1}He has lost the bird.{\i0}
{\i1}Put him in the Cone of Shame.{\i0}


600
00:55:21,310 --> 00:55:23,650
I do not like the Cone of Shame.


601
00:55:25,030 --> 00:55:29,280
Well most of the collection
is housed in the world's top museums


602
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:33,120
New York Munich London.
Of course I kept the best for myself.


603
00:55:33,490 --> 00:55:36,330
Did you ever! Will you look at that?


604
00:55:36,410 --> 00:55:38,910
Oh yes the Arsinoitherium.


605
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,710
Beast charged
while I was brushing my teeth.


606
00:55:41,790 --> 00:55:44,540
Used my shaving kit to bring him down.


607
00:55:44,630 --> 00:55:46,340
Oh yeah. Well surprise me.


608
00:55:46,420 --> 00:55:48,840
Only way to get it out
of Ethiopia at the time


609
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:51,880
was to have it declared
as dental equipment.


610
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:55,680
Oh my gosh!
The giant Somalian leopard tortoise!


611
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:58,640
Oh you recognize it. I'm impressed.


612
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:01,020
That's an interesting story there.


613
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:03,150
Excellent choice.


614
00:56:03,230 --> 00:56:07,020
I found it on safari with Roosevelt.


615
00:56:07,110 --> 00:56:10,990
He and I fell into a habit
of playing gin rummy in the evenings


616
00:56:11,070 --> 00:56:12,910
and did he cheat!


617
00:56:12,990 --> 00:56:15,240
Oh he was horrible.


618
00:56:15,870 --> 00:56:18,490
{\i1}Master dinner is ready.{\i0}


619
00:56:18,830 --> 00:56:20,960
Oh dear. Broken translator.


620
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:25,630
It's that loose wire again.
There you go big fella.


621
00:56:25,710 --> 00:56:27,090
Thank you Master.


622
00:56:27,170 --> 00:56:29,380
I liked his other voice.


623
00:56:30,590 --> 00:56:33,880
Well dinner is served. Right this way.


624
00:56:35,010 --> 00:56:38,180
So how are things stateside huh?


625
00:56:38,270 --> 00:56:40,680
Almost tempted to go back a few times


626
00:56:41,730 --> 00:56:44,350
but I have unfinished work here.


627
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:47,440
Please. I hope you're hungry


628
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:51,820
because Epsilon is the finest chef
I've ever had.


629
00:56:56,620 --> 00:56:59,620
Oh Epsilon you've done it again!


630
00:56:59,700 --> 00:57:00,750
Yes!


631
00:57:02,290 --> 00:57:04,290
Hey! Hey!


632
00:57:04,710 --> 00:57:07,750
Oh my Ellie would've loved all this.


633
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:10,300
You know it's because of you
she had this dream


634
00:57:10,380 --> 00:57:13,050
to come down here
and live by Paradise Falls.


635
00:57:13,130 --> 00:57:15,680
I'm honored. And now you've made it.


636
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:18,220
You're sure we're not a bother?
I'd hate to impose.


637
00:57:18,310 --> 00:57:22,350
No no. It's a pleasure to have guests
a real treat.


638
00:57:22,430 --> 00:57:23,850
Treat! Where's the treat!
Treat!


639
00:57:25,060 --> 00:57:26,980
No no. Quiet!
Calm down calm down.


640
00:57:27,060 --> 00:57:28,480
-I want a treat! I want a treat!
-Hey!


641
00:57:28,570 --> 00:57:30,150
I shouldn't have used that word.


642
00:57:30,230 --> 00:57:32,990
Having guests is a delight.


643
00:57:33,070 --> 00:57:36,950
More often I get thieves
come to steal what's rightfully mine.


644
00:57:37,030 --> 00:57:38,070
No!


645
00:57:40,620 --> 00:57:43,080
They called me a fraud those...


646
00:57:45,670 --> 00:57:49,590
But once I bring back this creature
my name will be cleared.


647
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:52,460
Beautiful isn't it?


648
00:57:55,130 --> 00:57:57,800
I've spent a lifetime tracking it.


649
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:03,600
Sometimes years go by
between sightings.


650
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:09,150
I've tried to smoke it out of that
deathly labyrinth where it lives.


651
00:58:09,980 --> 00:58:11,650
You can't go in after it.


652
00:58:12,150 --> 00:58:14,360
Once in there's no way out.


653
00:58:14,990 --> 00:58:16,950
I've lost so many dogs.


654
00:58:19,620 --> 00:58:24,120
And here they come these bandits
and think the bird is theirs to take.


655
00:58:24,790 --> 00:58:29,830
But they soon find that this mountain
is a very dangerous place.


656
00:58:32,590 --> 00:58:34,670
Hey that looks like Kevin.


657
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:39,550
-Kevin?
-Yeah that's my new giant bird pet.


658
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:41,720
I trained it to follow us.


659
00:58:41,810 --> 00:58:45,020
Follow you? It's impossible. How?


660
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:47,940
-She likes chocolate.
-Chocolate?


661
00:58:48,350 --> 00:58:51,940
Yeah. I gave her some of my chocolate.
She goes gaga for it.


662
00:58:52,020 --> 00:58:54,940
But it ran off. It's gone now.


663
00:59:01,780 --> 00:59:06,370
You know Carl these people
who pass through here


664
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:09,040
they all tell pretty good stories.


665
00:59:11,750 --> 00:59:14,000
A surveyor making a map.


666
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:18,130
A botanist cataloguing plants.


667
00:59:21,220 --> 00:59:26,890
An old man taking his house
to Paradise Falls.


668
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:37,570
I mean that's the best one yet.
I can't wait to hear how it ends.


669
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:50,830
Well it's been a wonderful evening
but we better be going.


670
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:52,250
Oh you're not leaving.


671
00:59:52,330 --> 00:59:55,960
We don't want to take advantage
of your hospitality.


672
00:59:56,050 --> 00:59:59,260
-Come on Russell.
-But we haven't even had dessert yet.


673
00:59:59,340 --> 01:00:02,260
The boy's right.
You haven't had dessert.


674
01:00:02,590 --> 01:00:06,970
Epsilon here makes
a delicious cherries jubilee.


675
01:00:08,180 --> 01:00:11,270
Oh you really must stay. I insist.


676
01:00:11,940 --> 01:00:14,270
We have so much more to talk about.


677
01:00:18,610 --> 01:00:19,780
Kevin?


678
01:00:27,490 --> 01:00:28,870
It's here.


679
01:00:31,080 --> 01:00:32,080
Get them!


680
01:00:34,830 --> 01:00:37,250
-Hurry!
-I am hurrying!


681
01:00:37,340 --> 01:00:39,630
Ahhh! They're coming!


682
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:44,340
Master over here.


683
01:00:59,820 --> 01:01:02,150
Go toward the light Master!


684
01:01:31,020 --> 01:01:32,390
Russell!


685
01:01:36,860 --> 01:01:38,310
Get back!


686
01:01:41,030 --> 01:01:44,860
Go on Master!
I will stop the dogs!


687
01:01:46,070 --> 01:01:47,700
Stop you dogs.


688
01:01:58,590 --> 01:02:00,040
Whoa!


689
01:02:16,060 --> 01:02:17,190
Help!


690
01:02:17,730 --> 01:02:19,020
Help!


691
01:02:19,480 --> 01:02:20,690
Help!


692
01:02:22,230 --> 01:02:25,280
Caw caw! Raar!
Caw caw! Raar!


693
01:02:25,490 --> 01:02:27,240
Give me your hand!


694
01:02:38,580 --> 01:02:40,290
Hang on to Kevin!


695
01:03:11,870 --> 01:03:13,240
Kevin.


696
01:03:36,980 --> 01:03:40,890
Oh no no no. Kevin. Stay down.


697
01:03:41,810 --> 01:03:46,190
She's hurt real bad.
Can't we help her get home?


698
01:03:57,160 --> 01:03:59,750
All right but we gotta hurry.


699
01:04:06,380 --> 01:04:07,880
You lost them?


700
01:04:07,960 --> 01:04:09,130
No it was Dug.


701
01:04:09,220 --> 01:04:12,550
Yeah. He's with them.
He helped them escape!


702
01:04:13,890 --> 01:04:14,970
Wait.


703
01:04:15,310 --> 01:04:17,850
Wait a minute. Dug.


704
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:25,610
See anything?


705
01:04:25,690 --> 01:04:29,150
No. My pack is not following us.
Boy they are dumb.


706
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:30,690
This is crazy.


707
01:04:30,780 --> 01:04:34,360
I finally meet my childhood hero
and he's trying to kill us. What a joke!


708
01:04:34,450 --> 01:04:35,820
Hey I know a joke.


709
01:04:35,950 --> 01:04:37,830
A squirrel walks up to a tree and says


710
01:04:37,950 --> 01:04:41,120
"I forgot to store acorns for winter
and now I am dead."


711
01:04:41,210 --> 01:04:44,540
Ha! It is funny
because the squirrel gets dead.


712
01:04:48,130 --> 01:04:49,880
Careful Russell.


713
01:04:49,960 --> 01:04:51,550
You okay Kevin?


714
01:04:56,640 --> 01:04:58,890
You know what Mr. Fredricksen?


715
01:04:58,970 --> 01:05:01,850
The wilderness isn't quite
what I expected.


716
01:05:01,980 --> 01:05:03,560
Yeah? How so?


717
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:06,150
It's kind of wild.


718
01:05:06,560 --> 01:05:09,900
I mean it's not how they made it sound
in my book.


719
01:05:09,980 --> 01:05:11,900
Get used to that kid.


720
01:05:11,990 --> 01:05:14,400
My dad made it sound so easy.


721
01:05:14,490 --> 01:05:16,570
He's really good at camping


722
01:05:16,660 --> 01:05:19,740
and how to make fire
from rocks and stuff.


723
01:05:19,830 --> 01:05:22,540
He used to come to all
my Sweat Lodge meetings.


724
01:05:23,210 --> 01:05:26,500
And afterwards
we'd go get ice cream at Fentons.


725
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,750
I always get chocolate
and he gets butter brickle.


726
01:05:29,840 --> 01:05:32,800
Then we sit on this one curb
right outside


727
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:36,720
and I'll count all the blue cars
and he counts all the red ones


728
01:05:36,850 --> 01:05:40,390
and whoever gets the most wins.


729
01:05:43,100 --> 01:05:44,890
I like that curb.


730
01:05:48,110 --> 01:05:49,900
That might sound boring


731
01:05:50,570 --> 01:05:54,440
but I think the boring stuff
is the stuff I remember the most.


732
01:06:01,950 --> 01:06:03,790
Look! There it is!


733
01:06:04,540 --> 01:06:07,960
Hey kid. Hold on Russell. Stand still.


734
01:06:18,550 --> 01:06:22,140
Look at that bird go.
Wait up you overgrown chicken.


735
01:06:23,430 --> 01:06:26,890
That's it. Go Kevin!
Go find your babies!


736
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:33,280
Run Kevin! Run!


737
01:06:36,110 --> 01:06:37,450
Oh no!


738
01:06:42,660 --> 01:06:44,910
Russell give me your knife!


739
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:48,920
Get away from my bird!


740
01:07:15,190 --> 01:07:16,320
No!


741
01:07:22,950 --> 01:07:24,240
No!


742
01:07:30,630 --> 01:07:33,500
Careful. We'll want her
in good shape for my return.


743
01:07:35,300 --> 01:07:38,220
Let her go! Stop!


744
01:07:42,050 --> 01:07:43,970
Kevin!


745
01:07:57,690 --> 01:07:59,490
You gave away Kevin.


746
01:08:02,320 --> 01:08:05,160
You just gave her away.


747
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:12,580
This is none of my concern.
I didn't ask for any of this!


748
01:08:15,250 --> 01:08:18,010
Master it's alright.


749
01:08:18,840 --> 01:08:20,720
I am not your master!


750
01:08:21,430 --> 01:08:24,550
And if you hadn't have shown up
none of this would've happened!


751
01:08:24,680 --> 01:08:26,930
Bad dog! Bad dog!


752
01:08:35,270 --> 01:08:37,360
Now whether you assist me or not


753
01:08:37,860 --> 01:08:41,450
I am going to Paradise Falls
if it kills me.


754
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:57,440
Here. I don't want this anymore.


755
01:13:37,990 --> 01:13:39,160
Russell?


756
01:13:44,170 --> 01:13:45,210
Russell!


757
01:13:45,330 --> 01:13:48,790
I'm gonna help Kevin even if you won't!


758
01:13:50,170 --> 01:13:52,170
No Russell! No!


759
01:15:03,790 --> 01:15:04,830
Huh?


760
01:15:04,910 --> 01:15:06,080
Russell?


761
01:15:08,250 --> 01:15:09,370
Dug!


762
01:15:09,580 --> 01:15:14,210
I was hiding under your porch
because I love you. Can I stay?


763
01:15:14,300 --> 01:15:16,710
Can you stay?
Well you're my dog aren't you?


764
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:18,130
And I'm your master.


765
01:15:18,260 --> 01:15:19,720
You're my master?


766
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:21,140
Oh boy! Oh boy!


767
01:15:21,260 --> 01:15:24,010
Good boy Dug!
You're a good boy!


768
01:15:49,830 --> 01:15:50,960
Yes!


769
01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:54,790
Don't worry Kevin. I'll save...


770
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:08,770
And they wouldn't believe me.
Just wait till they get a look at you.


771
01:16:08,850 --> 01:16:10,100
Master?


772
01:16:10,520 --> 01:16:13,650
-The small mailman has returned.
-What?


773
01:16:14,150 --> 01:16:15,650
Let me go.


774
01:16:17,650 --> 01:16:19,610
Where's your elderly friend?


775
01:16:21,320 --> 01:16:23,530
He's not my friend anymore.


776
01:16:24,030 --> 01:16:27,490
Well if you're here
Fredricksen can't be far behind.


777
01:16:28,500 --> 01:16:30,660
Where are you
keeping Kevin?


778
01:16:31,830 --> 01:16:33,040
Let me go!


779
01:16:33,170 --> 01:16:35,340
Scream all you want
small mailman.


780
01:16:35,460 --> 01:16:37,840
None of your mailman friends
can hear you.


781
01:16:38,510 --> 01:16:42,010
I'll unleash
all my Wilderness Explorer training!


782
01:16:45,890 --> 01:16:47,510
Alpha
Fredricksen's coming back.


783
01:16:47,640 --> 01:16:51,230
Guard that bird. If you see the old man
you know what to do.


784
01:16:51,350 --> 01:16:54,650
Hey where are you going?
I'm not finished with you!


785
01:16:54,730 --> 01:16:56,650
Nice talking with you.


786
01:16:59,860 --> 01:17:00,900
Ahhh!


787
01:17:01,530 --> 01:17:03,700
Where are you Fredricksen?


788
01:17:22,220 --> 01:17:23,550
Russell!


789
01:17:36,110 --> 01:17:38,730
-Mr. Fredricksen!
-Dug bring her over!


790
01:17:40,610 --> 01:17:43,110
You came back for Kevin!
Let's go get her!


791
01:17:43,240 --> 01:17:45,410
I'm getting Kevin. You stay here.


792
01:17:45,530 --> 01:17:46,700
But I wanna help.


793
01:17:46,780 --> 01:17:48,070
I don't want your help.


794
01:17:48,200 --> 01:17:49,910
I want you safe.


795
01:17:57,080 --> 01:17:59,420
How do we get past these dogs?


796
01:17:59,800 --> 01:18:01,130
Point!


797
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:12,770
Kevin.


798
01:18:13,980 --> 01:18:16,440
Don't worry Kevin. We're on our way.


799
01:18:16,940 --> 01:18:20,060
Allow no one to be entering
through these doors.


800
01:18:20,610 --> 01:18:23,150
Guard well that bird my minions.


801
01:18:24,070 --> 01:18:25,490
What do we do now Dug?


802
01:18:38,790 --> 01:18:40,630
Who wants the ball?


803
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:43,630
Me! I want it!
Me! I do!


804
01:18:43,960 --> 01:18:45,340
I want the ball!
Give it to me!


805
01:18:45,470 --> 01:18:46,720
Then go get it!


806
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:49,180
I'm gonna get there first!


807
01:18:49,300 --> 01:18:50,680
Getting the ball!


808
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:52,260
I got it!


809
01:18:52,640 --> 01:18:53,640
Uh-oh.


810
01:18:57,480 --> 01:19:00,400
I'm sorry Kevin.
Let's get you out of here.


811
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:02,480
Master! He's gone!
The old man!


812
01:19:02,610 --> 01:19:03,610
He's here!


813
01:19:03,690 --> 01:19:05,820
He's got the bird!
The bird's gone...


814
01:19:05,940 --> 01:19:07,950
Calm down! One at a time!


815
01:19:11,450 --> 01:19:14,200
I...want...to...help!


816
01:19:14,330 --> 01:19:15,330
Ha-ha!


817
01:19:24,840 --> 01:19:26,300
He's in Hall D!
He's in Hall C!


818
01:19:26,380 --> 01:19:27,840
It's the old man!


819
01:19:28,220 --> 01:19:31,260
Does anyone know where they are?


820
01:19:46,820 --> 01:19:49,070
Gray Leader? Take down the house.


821
01:19:55,830 --> 01:19:57,120
Gray Leader checking in.


822
01:19:57,200 --> 01:19:58,200
Gray Two checking in.


823
01:19:58,330 --> 01:19:59,500
Gray Three checking in.


824
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:05,340
Target sighted.


825
01:20:13,800 --> 01:20:15,350
Come on Kevin.


826
01:20:22,650 --> 01:20:23,690
Auuggghh!


827
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:31,570
Hi.


828
01:20:57,850 --> 01:21:01,180
Any last words Fredricksen? Come on!
Spit it out!


829
01:21:04,940 --> 01:21:07,190
-Come on.
-Enough!


830
01:21:07,520 --> 01:21:12,240
I am taking that bird back with me.
Alive or dead!


831
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:40,220
Come on Kevin.


832
01:21:59,450 --> 01:22:02,410
I will have many enjoyments
from what I am about to do Dug.


833
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:12,300
He wears the Cone of Shame!


834
01:22:12,840 --> 01:22:16,260
{\i1}What?{\i0}
{\i1}Do not just continue sitting. Attack!{\i0}


835
01:22:19,350 --> 01:22:22,600
{\i1}No no! Stop your laughing!{\i0}
{\i1}Get this off of me!{\i0}


836
01:22:22,680 --> 01:22:24,600
Listen you dog. Sit!


837
01:22:26,190 --> 01:22:27,440
Yes Alpha.


838
01:22:27,520 --> 01:22:30,150
Alpha? I am not Alpha. He is...


839
01:22:30,520 --> 01:22:31,570
Oh!


840
01:22:33,190 --> 01:22:34,900
I can't do it.


841
01:22:37,240 --> 01:22:38,490
-Russell!
-Huh?


842
01:22:38,660 --> 01:22:42,080
Caw caw! Raar!
Caw caw! Raar!


843
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,500
You leave Mr. Fredricksen alone!


844
01:23:02,220 --> 01:23:04,100
Hey squirrel!


845
01:23:04,180 --> 01:23:06,180
Squirrel? Where?
Where? Where?


846
01:23:06,270 --> 01:23:07,600
Where's the squirrel?


847
01:23:11,440 --> 01:23:13,110
I hate squirrels.


848
01:23:33,800 --> 01:23:34,880
Dug!


849
01:23:35,380 --> 01:23:36,590
Master!


850
01:23:37,630 --> 01:23:40,970
Russell! Over here! Let's go!


851
01:23:45,810 --> 01:23:47,640
Mr. Fredricksen!


852
01:23:48,230 --> 01:23:49,850
Go on Kevin!


853
01:24:04,790 --> 01:24:05,910
No!


854
01:24:20,760 --> 01:24:23,090
Russell! Get out of there!


855
01:24:25,100 --> 01:24:27,220
No! Leave them alone!


856
01:24:42,530 --> 01:24:46,700
Russell hang on to Kevin!
Don't let go of her!


857
01:24:48,790 --> 01:24:50,870
Kevin! Chocolate!


858
01:25:13,400 --> 01:25:15,020
That was cool!


859
01:25:17,070 --> 01:25:21,440
Don't jerk around so much kid!
Easy Russell.


860
01:25:23,740 --> 01:25:26,240
Oh I am ready to not be up high.


861
01:25:49,600 --> 01:25:52,270
Sorry about your house
Mr. Fredricksen.


862
01:25:54,900 --> 01:25:57,690
You know it's just a house.


863
01:26:05,740 --> 01:26:07,910
Look at you. You're so soft.


864
01:26:10,490 --> 01:26:12,080
Aw!


865
01:26:12,160 --> 01:26:13,950
I wish I could keep one.


866
01:26:18,340 --> 01:26:20,380
Where's my cane? I just had it here.


867
01:26:28,640 --> 01:26:31,970
You know what? Keep them.
A little gift from me to you.


868
01:26:32,850 --> 01:26:34,390
Bye Kevin!


869
01:26:43,820 --> 01:26:45,110

-Blue one.
-Gray one.


892
01:28:25,050 --> 01:28:27,050
-Red one.
-That's a bike.


893
01:28:27,460 --> 01:28:29,130
It's red isn't it?


894
01:28:29,220 --> 01:28:31,090
Mr. Fredricksen
you're cheating.


895
01:28:31,300 --> 01:28:33,090
No I'm not. Red one.


896
01:28:33,180 --> 01:28:34,970
That's a fire hydrant.


897
01:28:37,100 --> 01:28:39,140
Maybe I need new glasses.


898
01:28:39,480 --> 01:29:02,370
Another blue one.


899
01:34:01,710 --> 01:34:05,930
{\i1}# Adventure is out there{\i0}
{\i1}It's heading our way{\i0}


900
01:34:06,090 --> 01:34:10,100
{\i1}# So grab your scarf and goggles{\i0}
{\i1}Let's fIy{\i0}


901
01:34:10,470 --> 01:34:14,770
{\i1}# I've mapped out ourjourney{\i0}
{\i1}We're up here to stay{\i0}


902
01:34:14,850 --> 01:34:19,110
{\i1}# A sunset is our home{\i0}
{\i1}A moonbeam we will own{\i0}


903
01:34:19,230 --> 01:34:22,990
{\i1}# My spirit of adventure is you{\i0}


904
01:34:23,530 --> 01:34:27,700
{\i1}# Freaks of nature span a gIobe{\i0}
{\i1}That's too big to deny{\i0}


905
01:34:27,780 --> 01:34:32,120
{\i1}# With canine guards we'll traveI there{\i0}
{\i1}and spit into their eye{\i0}


906
01:34:32,620 --> 01:34:36,830
{\i1}# Bang bang{\i0}
{\i1}Once the smoke has cleared{\i0}


907
01:34:36,920 --> 01:34:40,840
{\i1}# After all the crowds have cheered{\i0}


908
01:34:40,920 --> 01:34:45,420
{\i1}# We'll make it a joint venture{\i0}
{\i1}Before we're in our dentures{\i0}


909
01:34:45,510 --> 01:34:49,140
{\i1}# My spirit of adventure is you{\i0}


910
01:35:07,200 --> 01:35:11,490
{\i1}# Adventure is out there{\i0}
{\i1}Let's crack some champagne{\i0}


911
01:35:11,580 --> 01:35:15,830
{\i1}# I've hung a hundred heads{\i0}
{\i1}on my wall{\i0}


912
01:35:15,910 --> 01:35:20,330
{\i1}# To say that I'm traveIed{\i0}
{\i1}is far too mundane{\i0}


913
01:35:20,420 --> 01:35:24,710
{\i1}# Let's grab our aero-fare{\i0}
{\i1}The high-brows will be there{\i0}


914
01:35:24,800 --> 01:35:29,050
{\i1}# The spirit of adventure{\i0}
{\i1}is something to indenture{\i0}


915
01:35:29,140 --> 01:35:43,900
{\i1}# My spirit of adventure is you #{\i0}
