Mr. Dufresne,

19
00:02:06,918 --> 00:02:11,171
describe the confrontation you had
with your wife the night she was murdered.

20
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:17,928
It was very bitter.

21
00:02:18,012 --> 00:02:22,432
She said she was glad I knew,
that she hated all the sneaking around...

22
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:27,396
And she said she wanted a divorce in Reno.

23
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,314
What was your response?

24
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:31,358
I told her I would not grant one.

25
00:02:31,442 --> 00:02:34,486
"I'll see you in hell before I see you in Reno."

26
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:38,240
Those were the words you used, Mr. Dufresne,
according to your neighbors.

27
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:43,036
If they say so.
I really don't remember. I was upset.

28
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:47,666
What happened after you argued
with your wife?

29
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,668
She packed a bag.

30
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:53,922
She packed a bag to go and stay with...
Mr. Quentin.

31
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:56,300
DA: Glenn Quentin.

32
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:58,468
Golf pro at the Snowdon Hills Country Club.

33
00:02:58,553 --> 00:03:02,431
The man you discovered was your wife's lover.

34
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:05,559
Did you follow her?

35
00:03:06,811 --> 00:03:08,979
I went to a few bars first.

36
00:03:09,063 --> 00:03:11,940
Later, I drove to his house to confront them.

37
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:15,611
They weren't home, so I...parked in the turnout,

38
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:17,279
and waited.

39
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:19,573
DA: With what intention?

40
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:21,450
DUFRESNE: I'm not sure.

41
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:23,744
I was confused.

42
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:25,495
Drunk.

43
00:03:27,248 --> 00:03:30,250
I think...mostly, I wanted to scare them.

44
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:33,587
When they arrived,
you went up to the house and murdered them.

45
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:36,757
No. I was sobering up.

46
00:03:36,841 --> 00:03:39,593
I got back in the car,
and I drove home to sleep it off.

47
00:03:39,677 --> 00:03:43,138
Along the way, I stopped,
and I threw my gun into the Royal River.

48
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:45,432
I feel I've been very clear on this point.

49
00:03:45,516 --> 00:03:49,311
Well, where I get hazy is where the cleaning
woman shows up the following morning

50
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:55,067
and finds your wife in bed with her lover,
riddled with .38 caliber bullets.

51
00:03:56,110 --> 00:04:00,364
Now, does that strike you as a fantastic
coincidence, Mr. Dufresne, or is it just me?

52
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:02,282
(Whispers) Yes, it does.

53
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:08,455
Yet you still maintain that you threw your gun
into the river before the murders took place?

54
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:12,334
- That's very convenient.
- It's the truth.

55
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:17,130
DA: The police dragged that river
for three days, and nary a gun was found.

56
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:20,008
So, there could be no comparison made
between your gun

57
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:24,263
and the bullets taken from
the bloodstained corpses of the victims.

58
00:04:25,556 --> 00:04:28,433
And that also...

59
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:30,519
is very convenient.

60
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:32,104
Isn’t it, Mr. Dufresne?

61
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:35,565
Since I am innocent of this crime, sir,

62
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:39,236
I find it decidedly inconvenient
that the gun was never found.

We have the accused at the scene of the crime.

69
00:05:03,594 --> 00:05:05,429
We have footprints, tire tracks,

70
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:09,558
bullets strewn on the ground which bear
his fingerprints, a broken bourbon bottle,

lying dead in each other's arms.

75
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:22,404
They had sinned.

76
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:28,035
But was their crime so great
as to merit a death sentence?

77
00:05:29,203 --> 00:05:31,288
Now, while you think about that...

A revolver holds six bullets.

80
00:05:38,212 --> 00:05:39,588
Not eight.

81
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:43,133
I submit that this was not a hot-blooded
crime of passion.

82
00:05:43,217 --> 00:05:46,261
That could be understood, if not condoned.

83
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,972
No. This was revenge...

84
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:53,560
of a much more brutal
and cold-blooded nature. Consider this.

85
00:05:53,644 --> 00:05:56,188
Four bullets per victim.

86
00:05:56,272 --> 00:05:58,648
Not six shots fired, but eight.

87
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:02,652
That means that he fired the gun empty,

88
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:05,030
and then stopped to reload...

89
00:06:06,115 --> 00:06:08,700
..so that he could shoot each of them again.

90
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:11,370
An extra bullet per lover.

91
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:13,497

92
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:16,458

100
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:10,512
We see by your file
you've served 20 years of a life sentence.

101
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:12,180
Yes, sir.

102

103
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:17,018
Oh, yes, sir. Absolutely, sir.

104
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:20,605
I mean, I learned my lesson.

105
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:24,943
I can honestly say...I'm a changed man.

106
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:30,991
I'm no longer a danger to society.

Same old shit. Different day.

110
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:18,538
Yeah. I know how you feel.
I'm up for rejection next week.

111
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:22,292
Yeah, I got rejected last week.

112
00:08:22,376 --> 00:08:23,668
It happens.

113
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:25,337

114
00:08:25,421 --> 00:08:28,798
Get the fuck out of my face, will you, man?
You've had five packs already.

115
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:30,091
- Four.
- Five.

116
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:34,679
RED: There must be a con like me
in every prison in America.

117
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:36,681
I'm the guy who can get it for you.

118
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:39,893
Cigarettes, a bag of reefer - if that's your thing -

119
00:08:39,977 --> 00:08:43,563
a bottle of brandy

120
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:45,982
Damn near anything, within reason.

121
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:48,360
Yes, sir. I'm a regular Sears and Roebuck.

122
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:50,570

123
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:56,076
So, when Andy Dufresne came to me in 1949

124
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,496
and asked me to smuggle Rita Hayworth
into the prison for him,

125
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,665
I told him, "No problem."

126
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:46,042
Andy came to Shawshank Prison

127
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:50,255
in early 1947, for murdering his wife
and the fella she was banging.

128
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:54,634
On the outside he had been vice-president
of a large Portland bank.

You follow this officer.

137
00:10:56,447 --> 00:11:00,825
I haven't seen such a sorry-looking heap
of m-m-maggot shit in all my life.

138
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,994
MAN: Hey, fish! Come over here.

139
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:20,929

- Come on, fish.

00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:28,311

141
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:30,397
Smokes or coins? Better's choice.

142
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:32,273
Smokes. Put me down for two.

143
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:34,401
All right. Who's your horse?

144
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:37,779

00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:39,030
He'll be first.

146
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:41,324
- Bullshit. I'll take that action.
- Me too.

147
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:43,660
You're out some smokes, son. Let me tell you.

148
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:45,662
Heywood, you're so smart, you call it.

149
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:48,248
I'll take...t-t-the chubby fat-ass there.

150
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:51,710
The fifth one from the front.
Put me down for a quarter deck.

Fresh fish today! We're reeling them in!

153
00:11:58,926 --> 00:12:03,179
RED: I must admit, I didn't think much of Andy,
first time I laid eyes on him.

154
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:06,766
Looked like a stiff breeze would blow him over.

155
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:09,144
That was my first impression of the man.

156
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:10,937
MAN: What do you say, Red?

157
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:14,274
That tall drink of water
with the silver spoon up his ass.

158
00:12:14,358 --> 00:12:16,526
That guy? Never happen.

159
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:17,736
Ten cigarettes.

160
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:18,987
That's a rich bet.

161
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:21,281
All right. Who's gonna prove me wrong?

162
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:23,450
Heywood? Jigger?

163
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:24,993
Skeet?

164
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:27,287
Floyd?

165
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:29,497
Four brave souls.

166
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:32,417
TANNOY:

167
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:35,003
All prisoners return to your cell blocks.

Turn to the right. Eyes front.

169
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:14,626
This is Mr. Hadley. He's Captain of the Guards.

171
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:19,464
You are convicted felons.

172
00:13:19,548 --> 00:13:21,883
That's why they've sent you to me.

173
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:23,593

00:13:29,266 --> 00:13:30,642
The other rules...

177
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:32,435
you'll figure out as you go along.

178
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,312
Any questions?

179
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:35,605
When do we eat?

180
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:46,282
HADLEY: You eat when we say you eat!

181
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:49,744
You shit when we say you shit,
and you piss when we say you piss.

182
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:52,705
You got that, you maggot-dick motherfucker?

183
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,082
Aarghh!

184
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:56,125
On your feet.

185
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:58,002
NORTON: I believe in two things.

186
00:13:58,087 --> 00:14:00,964
Discipline and the Bible.

187
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:02,882
Here you'll receive both.

188
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:06,636
Put your trust in the Lord.

189
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,596
Your ass belongs to me.

190
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,767
Welcome to Shawshank.

191
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:19,315
Unhook 'em.

192
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:26,447
Turn around.

193
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:35,206
That's enough.

194
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:38,042
Move to the end of the cage.

195
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:39,502
Turn around.

196
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:40,837
Delouse him.

197
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:43,923
Turn around.

198
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:49,679
Move out of the cage, go left.
Pick up your clothes and Bible.

199
00:14:49,763 --> 00:14:51,306
Next man up.

200
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:56,603
To the right. Right, right, right.

201
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:58,229
Left, left...

202
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:02,483
RED: The first night's the toughest.
No doubt about it.

203
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:05,695
They march you in,
naked as the day you were born,

204
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:09,866
skin burning and half-blind
from that delousing shit they throw on you.

205
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:12,911
And when they put you in that cell,

206
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:15,663
and those bars slam home...

207
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:18,499
that's when you know it's for real.

208
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:21,920
Old life blown away in the blink of an eye.

209
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:23,212
Nothing left,

210
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:26,007
but all the time in the world to think about it.

211
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:31,012
Most new fish come close to madness
the first night.

212
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:34,390
Somebody always breaks down crying.

213
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:36,935
Happens every time.

214
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:39,103
The only question is:

215
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:40,605
Who's it gonna be?

216
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:44,275
It's as good a thing to bet on as any, I guess.

217
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:48,279
I had my money on Andy Dufresne.

218
00:15:57,915 --> 00:15:59,540
Lights out!

219
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:02,293
(Click of light switches)

220
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:23,147
RED: I remember my first night.

221
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:25,316
Seems like a long time ago.

222
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:29,320
MAN: Yoo-hoo!

223
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:31,906
Hey, fish.

224
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:35,034
Fish, fish, fish, fish, fishy.

225
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:39,038
- Boy, are you scared of the dark?
- You like it here, new fish?

226
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:41,457
You'll wish
your daddy never dicked your mommy.

227
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:45,545
Fishy! Oh, I want me a pork chop. Oh, yes!

228
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:50,675
You taking this down, new fish?
There's gonna be a quiz later!

229
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:54,137
- Poke your ass out, give me a first look!
- Shh! Keep it down.

230
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:57,557
RED: The boys always go fishing
with first-timers.

231
00:16:57,641 --> 00:16:59,684
They don't quit till they reel someone in.

232
00:16:59,768 --> 00:17:02,270
(Men whispering in background)

233
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:04,856
Hey, Fat Ass.

234
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:06,607
Fat Ass.

235
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:10,278
Talk to me, boy.

236
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:13,072
I know you're there. I can hear you breathing.

237
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:16,075
Don't you listen to these nitwits.
You hear me?

238
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,244
This place ain't so bad.

239
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:19,954
I tell you what.

240
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:24,292
I'll introduce you around.
Make you feel right at home.

241
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:26,961
I know a couple of big old bull queers

242
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:30,006
that would just love to make your acquaintance.

243
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:33,509
Especially that big, white,
m-mushy butt of yours.

244
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:35,511
God!

245
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:37,096
I don't belong here!

246
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:38,598
MAN: We have a winner!

247
00:17:38,682 --> 00:17:40,433
FAT ASS: I wanna go home!

248
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:42,351
And it's Fat Ass by a nose!

249
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:45,605
Hey, it's the fat guy! It's the fat guy!

250
00:17:45,689 --> 00:17:49,525
Fresh fish! Fresh fish! Fresh fish!

251
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:52,320
FAT ASS: I don't belong here!

252
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:53,613
ALL: Fresh fish!

253
00:17:53,697 --> 00:17:57,033
I wanna go home. I want my mommy.

254
00:17:57,117 --> 00:18:00,119
MAN: I had your mother. She wasn't that great.

255
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:01,704
(Men chanting) Fresh fish!

256
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:03,456
(Door opens)

257
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:06,334
What the Christ is this happy horse shit?

258
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:09,128
He took the Lord's name in vain.
I'm telling the Warden.

259
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:10,713
With my baton up your ass!

260
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:12,465
FAT ASS: Let me out of here!

261
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:15,927
What is your malfunction,
you fat barrel of monkey spunk?

262
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:17,178
FAT ASS: Please...

263
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:19,305
I ain't supposed to be here.

264
00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:20,765
Not me!

265
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:23,309
I ain't gonna count to three, or even one.

266
00:18:23,393 --> 00:18:25,686
Shut the fuck up, or I'll sing you a lullaby!

267
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:27,605
(Whispers) Shut up, man. Shut up.

268
00:18:27,689 --> 00:18:28,981
There's been a mistake!

269
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:32,235
You don't understand.
I'm not supposed to be here!

270
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,402
Open that cell.

271
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:37,657
MAN: Me neither.
You people run this place like a fucking prison!

272
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:47,166
HADLEY: Son of a bitch.

273
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:49,127
(Thuds)

274
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:51,254
(Whimpering)

275
00:18:51,338 --> 00:18:53,422
PRISONER: Take it easy.

276
00:18:58,762 --> 00:19:00,429
(Yelps)

277
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:19,574
If I hear so much as a mouse fart in here
the rest of the night,

278
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:23,327
I swear by God and sonny Jesus,
you will all visit the infirmary.

279
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:25,496
Every last motherfucker in here.

280
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:33,087
Call the trustees.
Take that tub of shit down to the infirmary.

281
00:19:47,394 --> 00:19:52,106
RED: His first night in the joint,
Andy Dufresne cost me two packs of cigarettes.

282
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:55,067
He never made a sound.

283
00:19:57,946 --> 00:20:00,031
(Gate buzzer)

284
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:13,836
GUARD: Tier 3 North. Clear.

285
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:16,088
Tier 2 South. Clear.

286
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:18,049
Tier 3 South. Clear.

287
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:20,092
Tier 1 North...

288
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:22,970
- Tier 1 South. Clear.
- Tier 4 South. Clear.

289
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:25,139
Prepare to roll out.

290
00:20:28,518 --> 00:20:30,603
GUARD: Roll out!

291
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:26,284
Are... Are you going to eat that?

292
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:29,287
I hadn't... I hadn't planned on it.

293
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:31,580
Do you mind?

294
00:21:38,922 --> 00:21:41,549
Ah...that's nice and ripe.

295
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:48,389
(Chirps)

296
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:55,604
Jake says thank you.

297
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:58,107
Fell out of his nest over by the plate shop.

298
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:04,905
I'm going to look after him
until he's big enough to fly.

299
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,782
Oh, no, no. Here he comes.

300
00:22:09,911 --> 00:22:13,831
Morning, fellas. Fine morning, ain't it?

301
00:22:13,915 --> 00:22:16,334
You know why it's a fine morning, don't you?

302
00:22:16,418 --> 00:22:18,836
Come on. Set 'em down.
I want 'em all lined up here,

303
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,714
just like a pretty little chorus line.

304
00:22:21,798 --> 00:22:23,883
Yeah, look at that!

305
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:26,844
- Look at that. Oh, Lord!
- I can't stand this guy.

306
00:22:26,928 --> 00:22:27,970
(Inhales)

307
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:30,723
Yes. Richmond, Virginia.

308
00:22:30,807 --> 00:22:32,892
- Smell my ass!
- After he smells mine.

309
00:22:32,976 --> 00:22:38,314
Gee, Red, it was a terrible shame
about your horse coming in last, an' all.

310
00:22:38,398 --> 00:22:41,609
But I sure do love that winning horse of mine,
though.

311
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:44,403
I owe that boy a great big, sloppy kiss
when I see him.

312
00:22:44,488 --> 00:22:47,490
Why don't you give him some of your cigarettes,
instead?

313
00:22:47,574 --> 00:22:49,367
Lucky fuck.

314
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:51,160
Hey, Tyrell.

315
00:22:51,244 --> 00:22:54,205
You pull infirmary duty this week?

316
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:55,998
How's that horse of mine doing?

317
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:57,541
Dead.

318
00:22:57,626 --> 00:23:03,005
Hadley busted his head up pretty good.
The doc had already gone home for the night.

319
00:23:03,006 --> 00:23:05,758
Poor bastard lay there till this morning.

320
00:23:05,842 --> 00:23:08,677
By then, hell, there weren't nothing we could do.

321
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:16,060
What was his name?

322
00:23:19,314 --> 00:23:20,689
What did you say?

323
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:24,944
I was just wondering if anyone knew his name.

324
00:23:25,028 --> 00:23:27,738
What the fuck do you care, new fish?

325
00:23:29,199 --> 00:23:32,576
It doesn't fuckin' matter what his name was.
He's dead.

326
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:54,265
Hey...

327
00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:57,101
Anybody come at you yet?

328
00:23:58,603 --> 00:24:00,604
Anybody get to you yet?

329
00:24:01,731 --> 00:24:04,775
Hey, we all need friends in here.

330
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,777
I could be a friend to you.

331
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:10,906
Hey...

332
00:24:15,745 --> 00:24:17,621
Hard to get.

333
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:20,958
I like that.

334
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:30,885
RED: Andy kept pretty much to himself at first.

335
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:33,429
I guess he had a lot on his mind,

336
00:24:33,513 --> 00:24:35,723
trying to adapt to life on the inside.

337
00:24:37,267 --> 00:24:39,977
It wasn't until a month went by
that he opened his mouth

338
00:24:40,061 --> 00:24:42,354
to say more than two words to somebody.

339
00:24:44,274 --> 00:24:46,317
As it turned out...

340
00:24:46,401 --> 00:24:48,319
that somebody was me.

341
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:56,076
TANNOY: Officers Russell and Burwell
report to the duty officer.

342
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,872
I'm Andy Dufresne.

343
00:24:59,956 --> 00:25:02,041
The wife-killing banker.

344
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:05,586
Why did you do it?

345
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:07,296
I didn't, since you ask.

346
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:10,424
(Laughs) You're gonna fit right in!

347
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:13,677
Everybody in here's innocent.
Didn't you know that?

348
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:17,097
- Heywood, what are you in here for?
- Didn't do it. Lawyer fucked me.

349
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:22,811
Rumor has it you're a real cold fish.

350
00:25:22,896 --> 00:25:26,649
You think your shit smells sweeter than most.
Is that right?

351
00:25:26,733 --> 00:25:29,068
- What do you think?
- To tell you the truth,

352
00:25:29,152 --> 00:25:32,238
I haven't made up my mind. (Chuckles)

353
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:36,408
I understand
you're a man that knows how to get things.

354
00:25:36,493 --> 00:25:39,995
I'm known to locate certain things,
from time to time.

355
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:43,082
- I wonder if you might get me a rock hammer.
- A what?

356
00:25:43,166 --> 00:25:44,542
A rock hammer.

357
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:46,919
- What is it, and why?
- What do you care?

358
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:51,674
Well, if it was a toothbrush, I'd just quote a price,

359
00:25:51,758 --> 00:25:54,343
but then a toothbrush is a non-lethal object.

360
00:25:55,762 --> 00:25:57,471
Fair enough.

361
00:25:57,556 --> 00:26:00,015
A rock hammer
is about six or seven inches long.

362
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,725
Looks like a miniature pickaxe.

363
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:02,935
Pickaxe?

364
00:26:03,019 --> 00:26:05,104
- For rocks.
- Rocks.

365
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:08,941
Quartz?

366
00:26:09,025 --> 00:26:10,693
Quartz.

367
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:14,321
And some mica.

368
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:15,573
Shale.

369
00:26:16,658 --> 00:26:18,242
Limestone.

370
00:26:18,326 --> 00:26:20,244
So?

371
00:26:20,328 --> 00:26:22,413
So, I'm a rock hound.

372
00:26:22,497 --> 00:26:25,708
At least, I was in my old life.
I'd like to be again on a limited basis.

373
00:26:25,792 --> 00:26:27,918
Or maybe you want
to hammer somebody's skull.

374
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:29,461
No, sir.

375
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:32,172
I have no enemies here.

376
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:34,633
No? Wait a while.

377
00:26:36,177 --> 00:26:38,345
Word gets around.

378
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:41,557
The Sisters have taken quite a liking to you.

379
00:26:41,641 --> 00:26:43,434
Especially Bogs.

380
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:48,731
I don't suppose it would help any
if I explained to them I'm not homosexual.

381
00:26:48,815 --> 00:26:50,316
RED: Neither are they.

382
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,110
You have to be human first. They don't qualify.

383
00:26:58,366 --> 00:27:02,911
Bull queers take by force.
It's all they want or understand.

384
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:06,624
If I were you,
I'd grow eyes in the back of my head.

385
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:08,042
Thanks for the advice.

386
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:09,710
Well, that's free.

387
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:12,046
You understand my concern.

388
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:14,673
Well, if there's any trouble,
I won't use the hammer.

389
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:18,969
Then I guess you want to escape.
Tunnel under the wall, maybe.

390
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:22,222
Did I miss something? What's funny?

391
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:25,351
You'll understand
when you see the rock hammer.

392
00:27:27,228 --> 00:27:29,229
What's an item like this usually go for?

393
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:32,358
Seven dollars in any rock and gem shop.

394
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:35,152
My normal mark-up's 20 per cent.

395
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:37,696
But this is a specialty item.

396
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:40,366
The risk goes up, the price goes up.

397
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:42,326
Let's make it an even ten bucks.

398
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:44,286
Ten it is.

399
00:27:45,372 --> 00:27:47,790
Waste of money, if you ask me.

400
00:27:47,874 --> 00:27:49,416
Why's that?

401
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:53,545
Folks around this joint love surprise inspections.

402
00:27:55,131 --> 00:27:57,424
If they find it, you're gonna lose it.

403
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:59,635
If they do catch you with it, you don't know me.

404
00:27:59,719 --> 00:28:01,929
Mention my name, we never do business again.

405
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:05,140
Not for shoelaces or a stick of gum.
Now, you got that?

406
00:28:06,643 --> 00:28:08,060
I understand.

407
00:28:08,144 --> 00:28:09,561
Thank you...

408
00:28:09,562 --> 00:28:11,188
Mr. er...?

409
00:28:11,272 --> 00:28:13,732
Red. The name's Red.

410
00:28:13,733 --> 00:28:14,775
Red?

411
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:17,611
Why do they call you that?

412
00:28:21,282 --> 00:28:23,367
Maybe it's because I'm Irish.

413
00:28:31,334 --> 00:28:34,378
RED: I could see
why some of the boys took him for snobby.

414
00:28:34,462 --> 00:28:37,881
He had a quiet way about him.

415
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:42,428
A walk and a talk
that just wasn't normal around here.

416
00:28:42,512 --> 00:28:44,054
He strolled...

417
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:48,475
like a man in a park,
without a care or worry in the world.

418
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:53,272
Like he had on an invisible coat
that would shield him from this place.

419
00:28:53,356 --> 00:28:57,526
Yeah. I think it would be fair to say...

420
00:28:57,527 --> 00:28:59,611
I liked Andy from the start.

421
00:29:01,364 --> 00:29:04,575
Let's go!
Some of us have got a schedule to keep.

422
00:29:07,871 --> 00:29:09,955
Move it! Come on. Move it!

423
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:16,712
Bob, how are you doing?
How's the wife treating you?

424
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:27,890
Easy.

425
00:29:27,974 --> 00:29:30,058
Keep it moving.

426
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:34,104
Red...

427
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:58,837
RED: Andy was right. I finally got the joke.

428
00:29:58,922 --> 00:30:03,425
It would take a man about 600 years
to tunnel under the wall with one of these.

429
00:30:07,764 --> 00:30:08,889
Book?

430
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:10,849
Not today.

431
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:18,273
- Book?
- No.

432
00:30:20,068 --> 00:30:21,276
Hey, Brooksy.

433
00:30:24,572 --> 00:30:26,657
Delivery for Dufresne.

434
00:30:33,748 --> 00:30:39,378
Book?

435
00:30:42,382 --> 00:30:44,508
Dufresne...

436
00:30:44,592 --> 00:30:46,760
Here's your book.

437
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:52,850
Thanks.

438
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:59,898
Dufresne! We're running low on Hexlite.

439
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:02,067
Get on back and fetch us up some.

440
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:41,231
If you get this in your eyes, it blinds you.

441
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:44,067
Honey...hush.

442
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:53,035
(Groans)

443
00:31:56,122 --> 00:31:58,540
That's it. You fight.

444
00:31:58,625 --> 00:32:00,208
It's better that way.

445
00:32:00,293 --> 00:32:02,085
(Screaming and yelling)

446
00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:11,470
RED: I wish I could tell you
that Andy fought the good fight,

447
00:32:11,554 --> 00:32:14,097
and the Sisters let him be.

448
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:16,183
I wish I could tell you that.

449
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:18,352
But prison is no fairy-tale world.

450
00:32:20,313 --> 00:32:22,439
He never said who did it.

451
00:32:22,523 --> 00:32:25,567
But we all knew.

452
00:32:25,652 --> 00:32:27,527
(Gate buzzer)

453
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:31,782
Things went on like that for a while.

454
00:32:31,866 --> 00:32:34,493
Prison life consists of routine...

455
00:32:34,577 --> 00:32:36,787
and then more routine.

456
00:32:39,165 --> 00:32:43,001
Every so often,
Andy would show up with fresh bruises.

457
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:46,213
The Sisters kept at him.

458
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:50,425
Sometimes he was able to fight 'em off.
Sometimes not.

459
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:53,762
And that's how it went for Andy.

460
00:32:53,846 --> 00:32:56,390
That was his routine.

461
00:32:56,474 --> 00:33:00,268
I do believe
those first two years were the worst for him.

462
00:33:00,353 --> 00:33:02,604
And I also believe,

463
00:33:02,689 --> 00:33:07,234
if things had gone on that way,
this place would have got the best of him.

464
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:10,278
But then, in the spring of 1949,

465
00:33:10,363 --> 00:33:12,364
the powers that be decided that...

466
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:15,867
The roof of the license-plate factory
needs resurfacing.

467
00:33:15,952 --> 00:33:18,704
I need a dozen volunteers for a week's work.

468
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:21,999
As you know,

469
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:25,794
special detail carries with it special privileges.

470
00:33:25,878 --> 00:33:27,963
RED: It was outdoor detail...

471
00:33:29,465 --> 00:33:33,051
..and May is one damn fine month
to be working outdoors.

472
00:33:33,136 --> 00:33:34,761
Stay in line there.

473
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:37,764
More than a hundred men
volunteered for the job.

474
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:40,934
(Whispers)

475
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:44,438
Wallace E Unger.

476
00:33:45,606 --> 00:33:48,066
Ellis Redding.

477
00:33:48,151 --> 00:33:50,986
Wouldn't you know it?

478
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:53,655
Me and some fellows I know
were among the names.

479
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:55,824
GUARD: Andrew Dufresne.

480
00:33:55,908 --> 00:33:59,453
RED: It only cost us a pack of smokes per man.

481
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:02,247
I made my usual 20 per cent, of course.

482
00:34:02,331 --> 00:34:05,917
HADLEY: So, this big-shot lawyer
calls me long-distance from Texas.

483
00:34:06,002 --> 00:34:07,711
I say, "Yeah?"

484
00:34:07,795 --> 00:34:11,506
He says, "Sorry to inform you,
but your brother just died."

485
00:34:11,591 --> 00:34:14,092
Oh, damn, Byron. I'm sorry to hear that.

486
00:34:14,177 --> 00:34:15,552
I'm not. He was an asshole.

487
00:34:15,636 --> 00:34:17,971
Ran off years ago.
Figured him for dead, anyway.

488
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:22,017
So, anyway, this lawyer fella says to me,
"Your brother died a rich man."

489
00:34:22,101 --> 00:34:24,811
Oil wells and shit. Close to a million bucks.

490
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:27,355
GUARD: A million bucks?

491
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,816
Fucking incredible
how lucky some assholes get.

492
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:32,444
Jeez-Louise! Are you gonna see any of that?

493
00:34:32,528 --> 00:34:35,614
35,000. That's what he left me.

494
00:34:35,698 --> 00:34:37,616
- Dollars?
- Yeah.

495
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:40,827
Holy shit! That's great.
That's like winning the sweepstakes.

496
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:42,120
Isn’t it?

497
00:34:42,205 --> 00:34:45,248
Dumb shit. What do you think
the government's gonna do to me?

498
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:47,876
Take a big, wet bite out of my ass, is what.

499
00:34:47,877 --> 00:34:52,047
Poor Byron! Terrible fucking luck, huh?

500
00:34:52,131 --> 00:34:54,800
RED: Crying shame.

501
00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:56,551
Some people really got it awful!

502
00:34:56,636 --> 00:34:58,178
Andy, are you nuts?

503
00:34:58,262 --> 00:35:00,388
Keep your eyes on your mop, man. Andy!

504
00:35:00,389 --> 00:35:03,433
GUARD: Well, you'll pay some tax,
but you'll still end up...

505
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:06,353
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Maybe enough to buy a new car. Then what?

506
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:08,814
I've got to pay tax on the car.

507
00:35:08,898 --> 00:35:12,776
Repair, maintenance, goddamn kids
pestering me to take them for a ride...

508
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:16,780
And at the end of the year, you figure the tax
wrong, you pay them out of your own pocket.

509
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:19,032
I tell you...Uncle Sam!

510
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:22,869
He puts his hand in your shirt
and squeezes your tit till it's purple.

511
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:25,664
- Andy! Andy!
- What's he doing?

512
00:35:25,748 --> 00:35:28,083
- Getting himself killed.
- Keep tarring.

513
00:35:28,167 --> 00:35:31,253
Some brother! Shit. (Spits)

514
00:35:31,337 --> 00:35:32,379
Hey!

515
00:35:35,716 --> 00:35:37,926
Mr. Hadley...

516
00:35:37,927 --> 00:35:39,386
do you trust your wife?

517
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:42,681
Oh, that's funny.

518
00:35:42,765 --> 00:35:45,642
You're gonna look funnier
sucking my dick with no teeth.

519
00:35:45,726 --> 00:35:49,187
I mean, do you think
she'd go behind your back, try to hamstring you?

520
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:52,149
That's it. Step aside, Mert.

521
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:53,733
This fucker's having an accident.

522
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:54,985
He's gonna push him off.

523
00:35:55,069 --> 00:35:59,197
Cos if you do trust her,
there's no reason you can't keep that 35,000.

524
00:35:59,282 --> 00:36:01,158
- What did you say?
- 35,000.

525
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:02,951
- 35,000?
- All of it.

526
00:36:02,952 --> 00:36:05,287
- All of it?
- Every penny.

527
00:36:05,371 --> 00:36:07,205
You'd better start making sense.

528
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:09,624
If you want to keep the money,
give it to your wife.

529
00:36:09,709 --> 00:36:13,837
The IRS allows a one-time-only gift
to your spouse for up to $60,000.

530
00:36:13,921 --> 00:36:15,463
Bullshit! Tax-free?

531
00:36:15,464 --> 00:36:18,633
Tax-free. The IRS can't touch one cent.

532
00:36:18,718 --> 00:36:21,303
You're the smart banker what killed his wife.

533
00:36:21,387 --> 00:36:24,931
Why should I believe a smart banker like you?
So I can end up in here with you?

534
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:26,516
It's legal. Ask the IRS.

535
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:29,811
They'll say the same thing.
But I feel stupid telling you this.

536
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:32,189
I'm sure you would have investigated the matter.

537
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:36,359
Yeah, I don't need no banker to tell me
where the bears shit in the buckwheat.

538
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:39,487
Of course not, but you do need someone
to set up the tax-free gift.

539
00:36:39,572 --> 00:36:41,448
It'll cost you. A lawyer.

540
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:43,867
A bunch of ball-washing bastards.

541
00:36:43,951 --> 00:36:47,787
I suppose I could set it up for you.
That would save you some money.

542
00:36:47,788 --> 00:36:50,165
If you get the forms, I'll prepare them for you.

543
00:36:50,249 --> 00:36:52,125
Nearly free of charge.

544
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:56,588
I'd only ask three beers apiece
for each of my co-workers.

545
00:36:56,672 --> 00:36:59,090
GUARD:
Co-workers! Get him! That's rich, ain't it?

546
00:36:59,175 --> 00:37:02,636
I think a man working outdoors
feels more like a man

547
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,471
if he can have a bottle of suds.

548
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:07,599
That's only my opinion...sir.

549
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:12,562
What are you jimmies staring at?

550
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:13,647
Back to work!

551
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:15,690
GUARD: Let's go. Work.

552
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:29,579
RED: And that's how it came to pass...
that on the second-to-last day of the job,

553
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:34,334
the convict crew that tarred the plate-factory roof
in the spring of '49...

554
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:37,629
wound up sitting in a row
at ten o'clock in the morning,

555
00:37:37,713 --> 00:37:41,591
drinking icy-cold, Bohemia-style beer...

556
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:46,888
courtesy of the hardest screw that ever
walked a turn at Shawshank State Prison.

557
00:37:46,973 --> 00:37:49,057
Drink up while it's cold, ladies.

558
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:54,604
The colossal prick
even managed to sound magnanimous.

559
00:37:56,357 --> 00:38:00,986
We sat and drank with the sun on our shoulders,
and felt like free men.

560
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:04,572
Hell, we could have been tarring the roof
of one of our own houses.

561
00:38:04,657 --> 00:38:07,951
We were the lords of all creation.

562
00:38:08,035 --> 00:38:12,580
As for Andy,
he spent that break hunkered in the shade...

563
00:38:12,665 --> 00:38:15,375
a strange little smile on his face,

564
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:17,544
watching us drink his beer.

565
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:25,844
Hey...

566
00:38:25,928 --> 00:38:27,220
Want a cold one, Andy?

567
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:28,972
No, thanks.

568
00:38:29,056 --> 00:38:30,849
I gave up drinking.

569
00:38:34,687 --> 00:38:37,856
RED: You could argue
he'd done it to curry favor with the guards.

570
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:40,775
Or maybe make a few friends among us cons.

571
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:46,489
Me, I think he did it just to feel normal again.

572
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:49,659
If only for a short while.

573
00:38:52,538 --> 00:38:54,873
RED: King me.

574
00:38:54,957 --> 00:38:57,375
Chess. Now, there's a game of kings.

575
00:38:57,460 --> 00:39:00,003
- What?
- Civilized, strategic.

576
00:39:00,087 --> 00:39:02,422
And a total fucking mystery.

577
00:39:02,506 --> 00:39:03,715
I hate it.

578
00:39:03,799 --> 00:39:05,717
Maybe you'll let me teach you someday.

579
00:39:05,801 --> 00:39:08,261
(Chuckles) Yeah. Sure.

580
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:10,472
I thought of getting a board together.

581
00:39:10,556 --> 00:39:13,350
Well, I'm the right man.
I'm the guy that can get things.

582
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:14,934
We might do business on a board.

583
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:17,812
But I want to carve the pieces myself.

584
00:39:17,897 --> 00:39:21,483
One side in alabaster, the opposing side
in soapstone. What do you think?

585
00:39:21,567 --> 00:39:23,485
I think it'll take years.

586
00:39:23,569 --> 00:39:26,154
Well, years I got.
What I don't have are the rocks.

587
00:39:26,238 --> 00:39:28,406
Pickings are pretty slim in the yard.

588
00:39:28,491 --> 00:39:30,450
Pebbles, mostly.

589
00:39:34,789 --> 00:39:37,665
Andy, we're getting to be kinda friends,
aren't we?

590
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:39,417
Yeah, I guess.

591
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:42,962
Can I ask you something?

592
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:45,048
Why did you do it?

593
00:39:46,258 --> 00:39:50,136
I'm innocent, Red. Just like everybody else here.

594
00:39:54,433 --> 00:39:56,518
What are you in for?

595
00:39:58,521 --> 00:39:59,521
Murder.

596
00:39:59,605 --> 00:40:01,022
Same as you.

597
00:40:01,107 --> 00:40:02,273
Innocent?

598
00:40:04,944 --> 00:40:07,028
Only guilty man in Shawshank.

599
00:41:06,505 --> 00:41:08,089
Where's the canary?

600
00:41:08,174 --> 00:41:09,507
How did you know?

601
00:41:09,508 --> 00:41:10,675
How did I know what?

602
00:41:10,759 --> 00:41:13,178
So, you don't know? Come.

603
00:41:15,931 --> 00:41:18,057
This is where the canary is, Johnny.

604
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:20,351
(Woman singing)

605
00:41:20,436 --> 00:41:24,439
Quite a surprise to hear a woman singing
in my house, eh, Johnny?

606
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:29,736
That's quite a...

607
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:31,488
surprise.

608
00:41:33,991 --> 00:41:35,700
Red...

609
00:41:35,784 --> 00:41:37,577
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

610
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:39,496
Here she comes.

611
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:42,457
This is the part I like -
when she does that shit with her hair.

612
00:41:42,541 --> 00:41:45,460
Yeah, I know. I've seen it three times this month.

613
00:41:45,544 --> 00:41:47,545
Gilda, are you decent?

614
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:49,672
Me?

615
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:51,299
(Men howl)

616
00:41:51,383 --> 00:41:53,426
Hah! God, I love it!

617
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:55,595
(Men cheer and whistle)

618
00:41:59,308 --> 00:42:03,102
I understand
you're a man that knows how to get things.

619
00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:07,065
Yeah, I'm known to locate certain things
from time to time. What do you want?

620
00:42:07,149 --> 00:42:09,651
- Rita Hayworth.
- What?

621
00:42:09,735 --> 00:42:11,569
Can you get her?

622
00:42:12,655 --> 00:42:16,115
So, this is Johnny Farrell.
I've heard a lot about you, Johnny.

623
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,076
Take a few weeks.

624
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,369
Weeks?

625
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:24,624
Well, yeah, Andy. I don't have her stuffed down
the front of my pants right now, I'm sorry to say.

626
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:27,210
But I'll get her. Relax.

627
00:42:29,463 --> 00:42:30,964
Thanks.

628
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:33,049
- It was a surprise, Mr. Farrell.
- It was.

629
00:42:33,133 --> 00:42:34,175
MEN: Sit down.

630
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:36,177
Did you tell him what I'm doing here?

631
00:42:36,262 --> 00:42:39,097
No, I wanted to save that as a surprise, too.

632
00:42:39,181 --> 00:42:40,848
Hang on to your hat, Mr. Farrell...

633
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:46,104
(Grunts)

634
00:42:50,943 --> 00:42:53,194
- Take a walk.
- I gotta change the reel.

635
00:42:53,279 --> 00:42:55,363
I said fuck off!

636
00:42:57,658 --> 00:43:00,118
(Door closes as film dialogue continues)

637
00:43:00,202 --> 00:43:02,996
Ain't you gonna scream?

638
00:43:04,373 --> 00:43:06,165
Let's get this over with.

639
00:43:10,296 --> 00:43:11,921
He broke my fuckin' nose!

640
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:26,477
Now...I'm gonna open my fly...

641
00:43:26,562 --> 00:43:29,522
and you're gonna swallow
what I give you to swallow.

642
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:32,400
Then you're gonna swallow Rooster's.

643
00:43:32,484 --> 00:43:35,320
You broke his nose,
he ought to have something to show for it.

644
00:43:35,404 --> 00:43:37,614
Anything you put in my mouth,
you're gonna lose.

645
00:43:37,698 --> 00:43:40,450
No. You don't understand.

646
00:43:40,534 --> 00:43:43,828
You do that, and I'll put
all eight inches of this steel in your ear.

647
00:43:43,829 --> 00:43:44,912
All right.

648
00:43:44,997 --> 00:43:49,626
But you should know that sudden, serious
brain injury causes the victim to bite down hard.

649
00:43:50,878 --> 00:43:53,296
In fact, I hear the bite reflex is so strong,

650
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:58,176
they have to pry the victim's jaws open...
with a crowbar.

651
00:44:01,013 --> 00:44:02,639
Where did you get this shit?

652
00:44:02,723 --> 00:44:04,390
I read it.

653
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:08,353
Know how to read, you ignorant fuck?

654
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:11,731
Honey...

655
00:44:12,983 --> 00:44:15,360
..you shouldn't.

656
00:44:15,444 --> 00:44:17,320
(Groans)

657
00:44:17,404 --> 00:44:20,406
RED: Bogs didn't put anything in Andy's mouth...

658
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:22,867
and neither did his friends.

659
00:44:22,951 --> 00:44:26,245
What they did do...
is beat him within an inch of his life.

660
00:44:27,456 --> 00:44:29,457
Andy spent a month in the infirmary.

661
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:33,002
Bogs spent a week in the hole.

662
00:44:37,466 --> 00:44:39,092
Time's up, Bogs.

663
00:44:42,763 --> 00:44:44,847
It's your world, boss.

664
00:44:46,934 --> 00:44:50,353
TANNOY:
Return to your cell blocks for evening count.

665
00:44:50,437 --> 00:44:52,605
All prisoners report for lockdown.

666
00:45:08,163 --> 00:45:09,455
What?

667
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:13,876
(Gasps)

668
00:45:16,088 --> 00:45:18,172
(Bogs cries in pain)

669
00:45:21,927 --> 00:45:24,637
GUARD: Where's he going?
HADLEY: Grab his ankles.

670
00:45:26,223 --> 00:45:28,725
No! No!

671
00:45:28,809 --> 00:45:30,184
No!

672
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:31,602
Help me...

673
00:45:31,687 --> 00:45:32,979
Aaarghh!

674
00:45:33,063 --> 00:45:35,189
(Punching and screaming)

675
00:45:35,274 --> 00:45:37,942
RED:
Two things never happened again after that.

676
00:45:38,026 --> 00:45:40,862
The Sisters never laid a finger on Andy again...

677
00:45:42,072 --> 00:45:44,782
..and Bogs never walked again.

678
00:45:45,909 --> 00:45:49,328
They transferred him
to a minimum-security hospital upstate.

679
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:55,126
To my knowledge, he lived out the rest
of his days drinking his food through a straw.

680
00:45:55,210 --> 00:45:59,881
I'm thinking Andy could use a nice welcome
back when he gets out of the infirmary.

681
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:04,802
Sounds good to us.
I figure we owe him that much for the beer.

682
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:08,848
The man likes to play chess.

683
00:46:08,932 --> 00:46:11,017
Let's get him some rocks.

684
00:46:43,425 --> 00:46:45,301
Guys...

685
00:46:45,385 --> 00:46:47,762
I got one. I got one. Look.

686
00:46:50,182 --> 00:46:52,266
Heywood, that isn't soapstone.

687
00:46:52,351 --> 00:46:54,560
And it ain't alabaster, either.

688
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:56,270
What are you, a fucking geologist?

689
00:46:56,355 --> 00:46:58,397
He's right. It ain't.

690
00:46:58,482 --> 00:46:59,732
Well, what the hell is it?

691
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:02,360
RED: A horse apple.

692
00:47:02,444 --> 00:47:05,571
- Bullshit.
- No, horse shit. Petrified.

693
00:47:05,656 --> 00:47:07,740
(Horse whinnies)

694
00:47:11,954 --> 00:47:14,831
- Oh, Jesus Christ!
(Men laugh)

695
00:47:14,915 --> 00:47:16,874
Oh, damn!

696
00:47:16,959 --> 00:47:20,920
RED: Despite a few hitches,
the boys came through in fine style.

697
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:24,757
And by the weekend he was due back,
we had enough rocks

698
00:47:24,842 --> 00:47:27,885
to keep him busy till rapture.

699
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:30,680
I also got a big shipment in that week.

700
00:47:30,764 --> 00:47:33,307
Cigarettes. Chewing gum.

701
00:47:33,392 --> 00:47:34,892
Sipping whisky.

702
00:47:34,977 --> 00:47:38,521
Playing cards with naked ladies on them.
You name it.

703
00:47:38,605 --> 00:47:41,566
And of course, the most important item.

704
00:47:43,318 --> 00:47:45,403
Rita Hayworth herself.

705
00:48:19,563 --> 00:48:22,398
GUARD: OK, look alive! Open all tiers.

706
00:48:22,482 --> 00:48:24,817
(Furtively) Heads up. They're tossing the cells.

707
00:48:24,902 --> 00:48:27,153
Heads up. They're tossing the cells.

708
00:48:29,281 --> 00:48:31,157
119.

709
00:48:32,659 --> 00:48:34,327
123.

710
00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:37,496
(Guards calling out)

711
00:48:43,795 --> 00:48:45,671
On your feet.

712
00:48:47,382 --> 00:48:49,258
Face the wall.

713
00:49:23,752 --> 00:49:25,836
HADLEY: Turn around and face the Warden.

714
00:49:31,551 --> 00:49:33,636
Pleased to see you reading this.

715
00:49:35,013 --> 00:49:37,306
Any favorite passages?

716
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:43,479
"Watch ye, therefore, for ye know not
when the master of the house cometh."

717
00:49:44,523 --> 00:49:47,400
Mark 13:35.

718
00:49:47,484 --> 00:49:50,152
I always liked that one.

719
00:49:50,237 --> 00:49:51,737
But I prefer...

720
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:54,573
"I'm the light of the world.

721
00:49:54,658 --> 00:49:58,202
He that followeth me shall not walk in darkness,
but shall have the light of life."

722
00:49:58,286 --> 00:50:00,871
John, Chapter 8, Verse 12.

723
00:50:00,956 --> 00:50:04,417
I hear you're good with numbers. How nice.

724
00:50:05,544 --> 00:50:07,628
A man should have a skill.

725
00:50:09,715 --> 00:50:11,173
Wanna explain this?

726
00:50:12,259 --> 00:50:15,720
It's called a rock blanket.
It's for shaping and polishing rocks.

727
00:50:16,763 --> 00:50:18,723
A little hobby of mine.

728
00:50:27,149 --> 00:50:29,483
(Inhales)

729
00:50:29,568 --> 00:50:32,570
It's pretty clean. Some contraband here,

730
00:50:32,654 --> 00:50:34,739
but nothing to get in a twist over.

731
00:50:38,577 --> 00:50:40,661
I can't say I approve of this.

732
00:50:42,164 --> 00:50:43,873
But I suppose...

733
00:50:45,834 --> 00:50:47,710
..exceptions can be made.

734
00:50:58,096 --> 00:51:00,389
HADLEY: Lock 'em up!

735
00:51:02,392 --> 00:51:04,351
I almost forgot.

736
00:51:04,436 --> 00:51:06,687
I'd hate to deprive you of this.

737
00:51:06,772 --> 00:51:08,230
Salvation lies within.

738
00:51:09,316 --> 00:51:10,649
Yes, sir.

739
00:51:18,950 --> 00:51:21,535
RED: Tossing cells was just an excuse.

740
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:25,664
The truth is, Norton wanted to size Andy up.

741
00:51:39,304 --> 00:51:42,431
My wife made that in church group.

742
00:51:44,768 --> 00:51:46,102
Very nice, sir.

743
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:49,146
Do you enjoy working in the laundry?

744
00:51:50,774 --> 00:51:52,483
No, sir, not especially.

745
00:51:52,567 --> 00:51:55,361
Perhaps we can find something more...

746
00:51:55,445 --> 00:51:57,530
befitting a man of your education.

747
00:52:01,868 --> 00:52:03,744
(Bird screeches)

748
00:52:05,872 --> 00:52:07,540
Hey, Jake. Where's Brooks?

749
00:52:07,624 --> 00:52:08,916
Andy.

750
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,293
I thought I heard you out here!

751
00:52:12,796 --> 00:52:14,380
I've been reassigned to you.

752
00:52:14,464 --> 00:52:17,633
I know. They told me. (Chuckles)

753
00:52:17,717 --> 00:52:19,802
Ain't that a kick in the head?

754
00:52:19,886 --> 00:52:22,388
Well, I'll give you the dime tour.

755
00:52:22,472 --> 00:52:24,557
Come on.

756
00:52:24,641 --> 00:52:26,809
Well, here she is.

757
00:52:26,893 --> 00:52:29,436
Shawshank Prison library.

758
00:52:29,521 --> 00:52:32,398
National Geographics.

759
00:52:32,482 --> 00:52:35,317
Reader's Digest condensed books.

760
00:52:35,402 --> 00:52:37,695
Louis L'Amour.

761
00:52:37,696 --> 00:52:39,822
Look Magazine.

762
00:52:39,906 --> 00:52:42,408
Erle Stanley Gardners.

763
00:52:42,492 --> 00:52:46,036
Every evening,
I load up the cart and make my round.

764
00:52:46,037 --> 00:52:49,206
I enter the names on this clipboard here.

765
00:52:49,291 --> 00:52:52,751
Easy-peasy, Japanesey. Any questions?

766
00:52:52,836 --> 00:52:55,796
Brooks, how long have you been librarian?

767
00:52:55,881 --> 00:53:01,051
Oh...I come here in '05,
and they made me librarian in 1912.

768
00:53:01,136 --> 00:53:04,513
And in all that time,
have you ever had an assistant?

769
00:53:04,598 --> 00:53:07,183
No. No, not much to it, really.

770
00:53:07,267 --> 00:53:09,185
Well, why me? Why now?

771
00:53:09,269 --> 00:53:10,769
I don't know,

772
00:53:10,854 --> 00:53:14,190
but it'll be nice to have some company
down here for a change.

773
00:53:14,191 --> 00:53:16,275
HADLEY: Dufresne!

774
00:53:25,577 --> 00:53:27,661
That's him. That's the one.

775
00:53:35,212 --> 00:53:36,503
I'm Dekins.

776
00:53:36,588 --> 00:53:39,048
(Nervously) I was er...

777
00:53:39,132 --> 00:53:43,135
thinking about maybe setting up
some kind of trust fund for my kids' educations.

778
00:53:45,472 --> 00:53:46,931
Oh...

779
00:53:47,015 --> 00:53:48,682
I see.

780
00:53:50,143 --> 00:53:52,019
Well, erm...

781
00:53:53,396 --> 00:53:54,939
..why don't we have a seat,

782
00:53:55,023 --> 00:53:57,107
and talk it over?

783
00:53:59,653 --> 00:54:02,571
Brooks,
do you have a piece of paper and a pencil?

784
00:54:14,042 --> 00:54:15,751
Thanks.

785
00:54:15,835 --> 00:54:17,503
So...

786
00:54:18,755 --> 00:54:21,257
Mr. Dekins...

787
00:54:21,341 --> 00:54:25,803
And then Andy says to Mr. Dekins,
"Do you want your sons to go to Harvard,

788
00:54:25,887 --> 00:54:28,013
- or Yale?"
- He didn't say that?

789
00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:30,766
As God is my witness, he did!

790
00:54:30,850 --> 00:54:34,228
Dekins just blinked for a second.
Then he laughed himself silly.

791
00:54:34,312 --> 00:54:36,188
And afterwards he shook Andy's hand.

792
00:54:36,273 --> 00:54:37,648
My ass!

793
00:54:37,732 --> 00:54:38,941
Shook his hand.

794
00:54:39,025 --> 00:54:41,986
Hell, I...I near soiled myself! (Laughs)

795
00:54:42,070 --> 00:54:46,282
All Andy needed was a suit and a tie
and a little jiggly hula girl on his desk,

796
00:54:46,366 --> 00:54:47,700
and he would have been:

797
00:54:47,784 --> 00:54:49,326
"Mr. Dufresne, if you please"!

798
00:54:49,411 --> 00:54:51,161
Making a few friends, Andy?

799
00:54:52,205 --> 00:54:54,164
I wouldn't say "friends".

800
00:54:54,249 --> 00:54:58,252
I'm a convicted murderer
who provides sound financial planning.

801
00:54:58,336 --> 00:55:00,671
It's a wonderful pet to have.

802
00:55:00,755 --> 00:55:02,673
Got you out of the laundry, though.

803
00:55:02,757 --> 00:55:04,967
Well, it might do more than that.

804
00:55:05,051 --> 00:55:08,053
How about expanding the library?
Get some new books in there.

805
00:55:08,138 --> 00:55:10,848
If you're gonna ask for something,
ask for a pool table.

806
00:55:10,932 --> 00:55:13,392
- Right.
- How do you expect to do that?

807
00:55:13,476 --> 00:55:18,731
I mean, get new books in here,
Mr. Dufresne, if you please?

808
00:55:18,815 --> 00:55:20,566
Ask the Warden for funds.

809
00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:21,900
(Laughter)

810
00:55:21,985 --> 00:55:25,279
Son, son. Six wardens
have been through here in my tenure,

811
00:55:25,363 --> 00:55:28,991
and I've learned one immutable, universal truth.

812
00:55:29,075 --> 00:55:30,784
Not one of them born...

813
00:55:30,785 --> 00:55:35,748
whose asshole wouldn't pucker up tighter than
a snare drum when you asked them for funds.

814
00:55:35,832 --> 00:55:38,125
The budget's stretched thin, as it is.

815
00:55:38,209 --> 00:55:39,460
I see.

816
00:55:39,544 --> 00:55:43,088
Perhaps I could write to the State Senate
and request funds from them.

817
00:55:43,173 --> 00:55:47,551
As far as they're concerned, there's only three
ways to spend money when it comes to prisons:

818
00:55:47,635 --> 00:55:49,720
more walls, more bars and more guards.

819
00:55:49,804 --> 00:55:54,224
Still, I'd like to try, with your permission.
A letter a week. They can't ignore me forever.

820
00:55:54,309 --> 00:55:55,851
Sure can.

821
00:55:55,935 --> 00:55:58,812
But you write your letters, if it makes you happy.

822
00:55:58,897 --> 00:56:01,190
I'll even mail them for you. How's that?

823
00:56:03,109 --> 00:56:06,153
RED: So, Andy started writing a letter a week,

824
00:56:06,237 --> 00:56:08,322
just like he said.

825
00:56:12,369 --> 00:56:16,497
And, just like Norton said, Andy got no answers.

826
00:56:24,339 --> 00:56:29,843
The following April, Andy did tax returns
for half the guards at Shawshank.

827
00:56:29,928 --> 00:56:33,013
The year after that, he did them all...

828
00:56:33,098 --> 00:56:35,182
including the Warden's.

829
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:40,312
The year after that, they rescheduled
the start of the intramural season

830
00:56:40,397 --> 00:56:42,481
to coincide with tax season.

831
00:56:44,776 --> 00:56:48,987
The guards on the opposing teams
all remembered to bring their W-2s.

832
00:56:49,072 --> 00:56:53,200
So, Moresby Prison issued you your gun,
but you had to pay for it?

833
00:56:53,284 --> 00:56:55,035
Damn right. The holster, too.

834
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:56,370
That's tax-deductible.

835
00:56:56,454 --> 00:56:57,621
You can write that off.

836
00:56:57,705 --> 00:57:01,041
RED: Yes, sir.
Andy was a regular cottage industry.

837
00:57:01,126 --> 00:57:04,169
In fact, it got so busy at tax time...

838
00:57:04,254 --> 00:57:06,296
he was allowed a staff.

839
00:57:06,381 --> 00:57:08,841
Hey, Red, can you hand me a stack of 1040s?

840
00:57:08,925 --> 00:57:11,593
It got me out of the wood shop
a month out of the year,

841
00:57:11,678 --> 00:57:14,346
and that was fine by me.

842
00:57:14,431 --> 00:57:17,808
And still...he kept sending those letters.

843
00:57:23,106 --> 00:57:24,940
Red, Andy.

844
00:57:25,024 --> 00:57:26,233
It's Brooks.

845
00:57:26,317 --> 00:57:28,777
(Men shouting)
- Watch the door.

846
00:57:28,862 --> 00:57:30,446
Please, Brooks.

847
00:57:30,530 --> 00:57:32,531
- Just calm the fuck down.
- Stay back!

848
00:57:32,615 --> 00:57:34,658
- Stay back!
- What the hell's going on?

849
00:57:34,742 --> 00:57:37,828
You tell me. One second he's fine.
Then out comes the knife.

850
00:57:37,912 --> 00:57:40,372
Brooks, we can talk about this. Right?

851
00:57:40,457 --> 00:57:42,583
Nothing to talk about, goddamn it!

852
00:57:42,667 --> 00:57:44,376
I'm gonna cut his fucking throat.

853
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:46,336
Heywood? Wait, what's he done to you?

854
00:57:46,421 --> 00:57:48,547
It's what they done!

855
00:57:48,631 --> 00:57:50,048
I...I got no choice...

856
00:57:50,133 --> 00:57:52,801
You're not gonna hurt him.
Even Heywood knows that.

857
00:57:52,886 --> 00:57:55,512
- Right, Heywood?
- I...I know that, sure.

858
00:57:55,597 --> 00:57:59,016
You won't hurt him, because he's a friend,
and you're a reasonable man.

859
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:00,392
That's right. Right, guys?

860
00:58:00,477 --> 00:58:03,854
- Yes.
- So, put the knife down. Brooks, look at me.

861
00:58:03,938 --> 00:58:05,772
Put the knife down.

862
00:58:06,858 --> 00:58:08,025
Brooks...

863
00:58:08,109 --> 00:58:10,360
Look at his neck, for God's sake.

864
00:58:10,445 --> 00:58:12,779
Brooks, look at his neck. It's bleeding.

865
00:58:12,864 --> 00:58:14,031
(Heywood gasps)

866
00:58:14,115 --> 00:58:15,699
It's the only...

867
00:58:15,783 --> 00:58:18,076
It's the only way they'd let me stay.

868
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:20,746
Come on. This is crazy.
You don't want to do this.

869
00:58:20,747 --> 00:58:22,831
Put it down.

870
00:58:24,167 --> 00:58:26,543
(Brooks sobs)

871
00:58:30,215 --> 00:58:34,927
Come on. Take it easy.
You're going to be all right.

872
00:58:35,011 --> 00:58:36,386
HEYWOOD: Him?

873
00:58:36,471 --> 00:58:40,140
Hell, what about me?
Crazy old fool damn near cut my throat.

874
00:58:40,225 --> 00:58:42,851
RED: Shit, Heywood,
you've had worse from shaving.

875
00:58:42,936 --> 00:58:45,187
What the hell did you do to set him off, anyway?

876
00:58:45,271 --> 00:58:47,606
Nothing. I come in here to say fare-thee-well.

877
00:58:47,690 --> 00:58:50,817
Ain't you heard? His parole's come through.

878
00:58:52,862 --> 00:58:55,989
I just don't understand what happened in there.
That's all.

879
00:58:56,074 --> 00:58:58,659
The old man's as crazy
as a rat in a tin shithouse.

880
00:58:58,743 --> 00:59:00,953
Oh, Heywood, that's enough out of you.

881
00:59:01,037 --> 00:59:04,039
- I heard he had you shitting in your pants.
- Fuck you!

882
00:59:04,123 --> 00:59:05,499
Would you knock it off?

883
00:59:05,583 --> 00:59:07,918
Brooks ain't no bug.

884
00:59:08,002 --> 00:59:09,878
He's just...

885
00:59:11,756 --> 00:59:13,590
He's just institutionalized.

886
00:59:14,926 --> 00:59:16,593
Institutionalized, my ass.

887
00:59:16,678 --> 00:59:20,973
The man's been in here 50 years, Heywood.
50 years.

888
00:59:21,057 --> 00:59:22,766
This is all he knows.

889
00:59:22,850 --> 00:59:25,269
In here, he's an important man.

890
00:59:25,353 --> 00:59:26,812
He's an educated man.

891
00:59:26,896 --> 00:59:28,981
Outside, he's nothing.

892
00:59:31,150 --> 00:59:33,777
Just a used-up con with arthritis in both hands.

893
00:59:33,861 --> 00:59:37,072
Probably couldn't get a library card if he tried.

894
00:59:37,156 --> 00:59:39,241
You know what I'm trying to say?

895
00:59:39,325 --> 00:59:42,077
Red, I do believe you're talking out of your ass.

896
00:59:43,329 --> 00:59:46,248
You believe whatever you want, Floyd.

897
00:59:46,249 --> 00:59:48,792
But I'm telling you, these walls are funny.

898
00:59:50,211 --> 00:59:52,296
First you hate 'em...

899
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:55,924
..then you get used to 'em.

900
00:59:57,552 --> 01:00:00,178
Enough time passes...

901
01:00:00,263 --> 01:00:03,223
you get so you depend on 'em.

902
01:00:03,308 --> 01:00:05,642
That's institutionalized.

903
01:00:05,727 --> 01:00:07,102
JIGGER: Shit.

904
01:00:07,103 --> 01:00:08,729
You can never get like that.

905
01:00:08,813 --> 01:00:10,731
Oh, yeah?

906
01:00:10,815 --> 01:00:13,400
Say that when you've been here
as long as Brooks has.

907
01:00:13,484 --> 01:00:15,360
Goddamn right.

908
01:00:17,697 --> 01:00:20,240
They send you here for life.

909
01:00:20,325 --> 01:00:22,409
That's exactly what they take.

910
01:00:24,329 --> 01:00:26,413
The part that counts, anyway.

911
01:00:29,459 --> 01:00:32,794
(Jake screeches)

912
01:00:33,921 --> 01:00:36,089
I can't take care of you no more, Jake.

913
01:00:38,009 --> 01:00:39,843
You go on, now.

914
01:00:40,928 --> 01:00:45,599
You're free.

915
01:01:01,491 --> 01:01:03,367
Bye.

916
01:01:04,452 --> 01:01:06,370
Good luck, Brooks.

917
01:01:42,949 --> 01:01:45,659
BROOKS: Dear fellas...

918
01:01:45,743 --> 01:01:49,955
I can't believe
how fast things move on the outside.

919
01:01:50,039 --> 01:01:51,289
(Horn blares)

920
01:01:51,374 --> 01:01:54,418
Watch it, old-timer! Are you trying to get killed?

921
01:01:54,502 --> 01:01:57,838
I saw an automobile once, when I was a kid,

922
01:01:57,922 --> 01:02:00,841
but now...they're everywhere.

923
01:02:05,054 --> 01:02:08,640
The world went and got itself
in a big damn hurry.

924
01:02:24,991 --> 01:02:31,288
The parole board got me into
this halfway house called The Brewer,

925
01:02:31,372 --> 01:02:35,167
and a job bagging groceries at the Foodway.

926
01:02:37,211 --> 01:02:42,549
It's hard work, and I try to keep up,
but my hands hurt most of the time.

927
01:02:42,633 --> 01:02:44,634
WOMAN: Make sure your man double-bags.

928
01:02:44,719 --> 01:02:46,970
Last time, the bottom near came out.

929
01:02:47,054 --> 01:02:50,348
Make sure you double-bag, like the lady says.
Understand?

930
01:02:50,433 --> 01:02:51,892
Yes, sir. I surely will.

931
01:02:51,976 --> 01:02:55,771
BROOKS: I don't think
the store manager likes me very much.

932
01:02:55,855 --> 01:02:57,647
(Pigeons cooing)

933
01:02:58,733 --> 01:03:03,528
Sometimes, after work,
I go to the park and feed the birds.

934
01:03:03,613 --> 01:03:08,950
I keep thinking Jake might just show up
and say hello.

935
01:03:09,035 --> 01:03:10,827
But he never does.

936
01:03:11,913 --> 01:03:17,292
And I hope, wherever he is,
he's doing OK and making new friends.

937
01:03:20,797 --> 01:03:23,715
I have trouble sleeping at night.

938
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:26,593
I have bad dreams, like I'm falling.

939
01:03:27,678 --> 01:03:29,596
I wake up, scared.

940
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:33,683
Sometimes it takes me a while
to remember where I am.

941
01:03:35,311 --> 01:03:36,770
Maybe I should get me a gun

942
01:03:36,854 --> 01:03:40,732
and rob the Foodway, so they'd send me home.

943
01:03:40,817 --> 01:03:43,151
I could shoot the manager, while I was at it.

944
01:03:43,236 --> 01:03:45,195
Sort of like a bonus.

945
01:03:46,697 --> 01:03:50,951
I guess I'm too old for that sort of nonsense
any more.

946
01:03:51,035 --> 01:03:53,078
I don't like it here.

947
01:03:53,162 --> 01:03:55,831
I'm tired of being afraid all the time.

948
01:03:55,915 --> 01:03:56,998
I've decided...

949
01:03:57,083 --> 01:03:58,959
not to stay.

950
01:04:10,304 --> 01:04:13,807
I doubt they'll kick up any fuss.

951
01:04:13,891 --> 01:04:15,976
Not for an old crook like me.

952
01:04:30,825 --> 01:04:32,742
(Scraping)

953
01:05:18,998 --> 01:05:23,043
"I doubt they'll kick up any fuss.
Not for an old crook like me.

954
01:05:24,211 --> 01:05:28,256
PS. Tell Heywood
I'm sorry I put a knife to his throat.

955
01:05:28,257 --> 01:05:30,342
No hard feelings. Brooks."

956
01:05:41,062 --> 01:05:43,146
He should have died in here.

957
01:05:48,569 --> 01:05:53,031
HADLEY: What the fuck have you done?
It's a goddamn mess. I'll tell you that.

958
01:05:57,745 --> 01:05:59,162
What's all this?

959
01:05:59,246 --> 01:06:03,124
You tell me, fuck-stick.
They're all addressed to you.

960
01:06:03,209 --> 01:06:04,501
Take it.

961
01:06:13,469 --> 01:06:15,053
"Dear Mr. Dufresne...

962
01:06:16,138 --> 01:06:18,139
In response to your repeated enquiries,

963
01:06:18,224 --> 01:06:22,936
the State has allocated the enclosed funds
for your library project."

964
01:06:23,020 --> 01:06:24,396
This is 200 dollars.

965
01:06:25,439 --> 01:06:29,359
"In addition, the Library District
has generously responded

966
01:06:29,443 --> 01:06:32,153
with a charitable donation
of used books and sundries.

967
01:06:32,238 --> 01:06:34,322
We trust this will fill your needs.

968
01:06:34,407 --> 01:06:38,535
We now consider the matter closed.
Please stop sending us letters."

969
01:06:38,619 --> 01:06:41,454
I want all this cleared out
before the Warden gets back.

970
01:06:41,539 --> 01:06:43,206
Yes, sir.

971
01:06:46,961 --> 01:06:48,336
Good for you, Andy.

972
01:06:50,965 --> 01:06:52,424
Wow!

973
01:06:53,509 --> 01:06:55,593
It only took six years.

974
01:06:56,887 --> 01:06:59,764
From now on,
I'll write two letters a week, instead of one.

975
01:06:59,849 --> 01:07:03,393
Oh, I believe you're crazy enough.
You'd better get all this stuff out,

976
01:07:03,477 --> 01:07:04,644
like the Captain said.

977
01:07:04,729 --> 01:07:08,606
Now, I'm gonna go pinch a loaf.
When I come back, this is all gone, right?

978
01:07:14,780 --> 01:07:16,781

higher and farther
than anybody in a grey place dares to dream.

It was like some beautiful bird
flapped into our drab little cage

Easiest time I ever did.

1026
01:11:18,691 --> 01:11:21,734
Bullshit!
There's no such thing as easy time in the hole.

1027

A week in the hole is like a year.

And in here.

That's the beauty of music.
They can't get that from you.

Haven't you ever felt that way about music?

1034
01:11:49,638 --> 01:11:53,725
Well, I played a mean harmonica,
as a younger man.

1035
01:11:53,809 --> 01:11:55,601
Lost interest in it, though.

1036
01:11:55,686 --> 01:11:57,520
Didn't make much sense in here.

1037
01:11:57,604 --> 01:12:00,064
Here's where it makes the most sense.

1038
01:12:00,149 --> 01:12:02,734
You need it, so you don't forget.

1039
01:12:02,818 --> 01:12:04,152
Forget?

..in the world that aren't made out of stone...

1043
01:12:12,328 --> 01:12:14,370
that there's a...

1044
01:12:14,455 --> 01:12:16,289
there's something...

1045
01:12:16,373 --> 01:12:19,167
inside that they can't get to...

1046
01:12:19,251 --> 01:12:21,544
that they can't touch.

1047
01:12:21,628 --> 01:12:23,504
It's yours.

1048
01:12:24,923 --> 01:12:26,632
What are you talking about?

1049
01:12:27,718 --> 01:12:29,302
Hope.

1050
01:12:29,386 --> 01:12:31,262
Hope?

1051
01:12:33,098 --> 01:12:35,767
Let me tell you something, my friend.

1052
01:12:35,851 --> 01:12:37,810
Hope is a dangerous thing.

1053
01:12:39,396 --> 01:12:41,439
Hope can drive a man insane.

1054
01:12:42,483 --> 01:12:44,400
It's got no use on the inside.

1055
01:12:44,485 --> 01:12:47,153
You'd better get used to that idea.

1056
01:12:49,573 --> 01:12:51,199
Like Brooks did?

1057
01:13:16,433 --> 01:13:17,475
Sit down.

1058
01:13:22,689 --> 01:13:26,150
It says here that you've served
30 years of a life sentence.

1059
01:13:26,235 --> 01:13:28,861
You feel you've been rehabilitated?

1060
01:13:28,946 --> 01:13:31,030
Oh, yes, sir.

1061
01:13:31,031 --> 01:13:33,116
Without a doubt.

1062
01:13:34,159 --> 01:13:36,494
And I can honestly say I'm a changed man.

1063
01:13:39,081 --> 01:13:41,124
No danger to society here.

1064
01:13:41,208 --> 01:13:43,292
God's honest truth.

1065
01:13:45,629 --> 01:13:47,713
Absolutely rehabilitated.

1066
01:13:57,641 --> 01:13:59,725
30 years.

1067
01:14:00,811 --> 01:14:02,854
Jesus, when they say it like that...

1068
01:14:02,938 --> 01:14:05,022
You wonder where it went.

1069
01:14:07,985 --> 01:14:10,069
I wonder where ten years went.

1070
01:14:15,117 --> 01:14:16,409
Here.

1071
01:14:16,493 --> 01:14:18,661
Little parole rejection present.

1072
01:14:20,497 --> 01:14:22,540
Go ahead and open it.

1073
01:14:22,624 --> 01:14:26,419
I had to go through one of your competitors.
I hope you don't mind.

1074
01:14:26,503 --> 01:14:28,588
I wanted it to be a surprise.

1075
01:14:38,724 --> 01:14:40,808
It's very pretty, Andy.

1076
01:14:41,894 --> 01:14:43,978
Thank you.

1077
01:14:45,731 --> 01:14:47,815
Are you going to play it?

1078
01:14:51,945 --> 01:14:54,030
No.

1079
01:14:56,325 --> 01:14:58,409
Not right now.

1080
01:15:03,540 --> 01:15:05,583
(Guards shout)

1081
01:15:05,667 --> 01:15:07,752
Tier 3 South. Clear.

1082
01:15:08,795 --> 01:15:10,838
Tier 4 North. Clear.

1083
01:15:10,923 --> 01:15:13,007
Tier 1 South. Clear.

1084
01:15:15,844 --> 01:15:17,929
Fall in!

1085
01:15:20,641 --> 01:15:22,725
(Gate buzzer)

1086
01:15:50,379 --> 01:15:52,421
(Guard's footsteps)

1087
01:15:52,506 --> 01:15:54,090
Lights out!

1088
01:15:54,174 --> 01:15:55,675
(Click of light switches)

1089
01:16:01,098 --> 01:16:03,182
(Guard walks away)

1090
01:16:09,356 --> 01:16:11,440
(Outer door closes)

1091
01:16:20,284 --> 01:16:22,368
(Gently plays one note)

1092
01:16:27,791 --> 01:16:28,916
(Hammering)

1093
01:16:29,001 --> 01:16:31,043
RED: Andy was as good as his word.

1094
01:16:31,128 --> 01:16:33,629
He wrote two letters a week instead of one.

1095
01:16:36,258 --> 01:16:40,386
In 1959, the State Senate
finally clued into the fact

1096
01:16:40,470 --> 01:16:43,347
they couldn't buy him off
with just a $200 check.

1097
01:16:43,432 --> 01:16:50,021
Appropriations Committee voted
an annual payment of $500 just to shut him up.

1098
01:16:50,105 --> 01:16:51,814
And you'd be amazed

1099
01:16:51,898 --> 01:16:53,566
how far Andy could stretch it.

1100
01:16:53,650 --> 01:16:56,527
He made deals with book clubs, charity groups.

1101
01:16:56,612 --> 01:16:58,988
He bought remaindered books by the pound.

1102
01:16:59,072 --> 01:17:01,282
Treasure Island.

1103
01:17:01,366 --> 01:17:03,534
Robert Louis...

1104
01:17:03,619 --> 01:17:04,827
..Stevenson.

1105
01:17:04,911 --> 01:17:06,370
Fiction, adventure.

1106
01:17:08,373 --> 01:17:09,999
What's next?

1107
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,710
I got here Auto Repair and...

1108
01:17:13,754 --> 01:17:15,087
..Soap Carving.

1109
01:17:15,172 --> 01:17:18,549
Trade skills and hobbies. Goes under
Educational. The stack behind you.

1110
01:17:18,634 --> 01:17:20,676
The Count Of Monte Crisco.

1111
01:17:20,761 --> 01:17:23,095
That's Cristo, you dumb shit.

1112
01:17:23,180 --> 01:17:26,974
By Alexandree...Dumass.

1113
01:17:27,059 --> 01:17:31,979
Dumb-ass?

1114
01:17:34,483 --> 01:17:36,817
Dumas. You know what that's about?

1115
01:17:36,902 --> 01:17:38,277
Uh-uh.

1116
01:17:38,362 --> 01:17:41,072
You'll like it. It's about a prison break.

1117
01:17:41,156 --> 01:17:45,159
We ought to file that under Educational, too,
oughtn't we?

1118
01:17:45,243 --> 01:17:49,413
RED: The rest of us did our best to pitch in
when and where we could.

1119
01:17:50,666 --> 01:17:52,500
By the year Kennedy was shot,

1120
01:17:52,584 --> 01:17:56,921
Andy had transformed a storage room
smelling of rat turds and turpentine

1121
01:17:56,922 --> 01:18:00,257
into the best prison library in New England,

1122
01:18:00,342 --> 01:18:04,220
complete with a fine selection of Hank Williams.

1123
01:18:04,304 --> 01:18:08,474
♪ Lawd I don't know what I'll do-ooo

1124
01:18:08,558 --> 01:18:11,310
♪ All I do is sit and sigh...

1125
01:18:11,395 --> 01:18:16,148
RED: That was also the year Warden Norton
instituted his famous Inside Out program.

1126
01:18:16,233 --> 01:18:18,943
You may remember reading about it.

1127
01:18:19,027 --> 01:18:22,446
It made all the papers
and got his picture in Look Magazine.

1128
01:18:22,531 --> 01:18:24,198
No free ride.

1129
01:18:24,282 --> 01:18:27,243
But rather a genuine, progressive advance

1130
01:18:27,327 --> 01:18:29,495
in corrections and rehabilitation.

1131
01:18:30,539 --> 01:18:32,873
Our inmates, properly supervised,

1132
01:18:32,958 --> 01:18:35,710
will be put to work outside these walls,

1133
01:18:35,794 --> 01:18:37,878
performing all manner of public service.

1134
01:18:37,963 --> 01:18:41,882
These men can learn
the value of an honest day's labor,

1135
01:18:41,967 --> 01:18:45,636
while providing a valuable service
to the community and...

1136
01:18:45,721 --> 01:18:50,933
at a bare minimum of expense
to Mr. and Mrs. John Q Taxpayer.

1137
01:18:51,017 --> 01:18:53,686
RED: Of course,
Norton failed to mention to the press

1138
01:18:53,770 --> 01:18:57,064
that "bare minimum of expense"
is a fairly loose term.

1139
01:18:57,149 --> 01:19:00,317
There are a hundred different ways
to skim off the top.

1140
01:19:00,402 --> 01:19:03,028
Men, materials, you name it.

1141
01:19:04,072 --> 01:19:06,824
And, oh, my Lord, how the money rolled in.

1142
01:19:06,908 --> 01:19:09,034
If this keeps up, you'll put me out of business.

1143
01:19:09,119 --> 01:19:11,287
- Ned!
- This pool of slave labor you've got,

1144
01:19:11,371 --> 01:19:13,414
you can underbid any contractor in town.

1145
01:19:13,498 --> 01:19:17,460
Ned, we're providing
a valuable community service here.

1146
01:19:17,544 --> 01:19:19,795
Well, that's fine for the papers

1147
01:19:19,880 --> 01:19:21,380
but I've got a family to feed.

1148
01:19:21,465 --> 01:19:23,174
Sam...

1149
01:19:23,258 --> 01:19:25,718
Sam, we go back a long way.

1150
01:19:25,802 --> 01:19:28,137
I need this new highway contract.

1151
01:19:28,221 --> 01:19:30,431
I don't get it, and I go under.

1152
01:19:30,515 --> 01:19:32,558
That's a fact.

1153
01:19:32,642 --> 01:19:34,727
You just have some of this fine pie

1154
01:19:34,811 --> 01:19:36,854
my missus made especially for you,

1155
01:19:36,938 --> 01:19:38,272
and you think about that.

1156
01:19:46,323 --> 01:19:49,241
Ned, I wouldn't worry too much
about this contract.

1157
01:19:49,326 --> 01:19:52,536
It seems to me I already got
my boys committed elsewhere.

1158
01:19:54,414 --> 01:19:56,999
You be sure and thank Maisie for this fine pie.

1159
01:19:58,627 --> 01:20:00,795
RED: And behind every shady deal,

1160
01:20:00,879 --> 01:20:03,088
behind every dollar earned,

1161
01:20:03,173 --> 01:20:06,342
there was Andy, keeping the books.

1162
01:20:07,385 --> 01:20:10,805
Two deposits.
Maine National and New England First.

1163
01:20:10,889 --> 01:20:12,973
Night drops as always, sir.

1164
01:20:43,380 --> 01:20:45,130
Get my stuff down to the laundry.

1165
01:20:45,215 --> 01:20:48,008
- Two suits for dry-clean and a bag of whatnot.
- Yes, sir.

1166
01:20:48,093 --> 01:20:51,846
Tell them if they over-starch my shirts again,
they'll hear about it from me.

1167
01:20:51,930 --> 01:20:53,931
How do I look?

1168
01:20:54,015 --> 01:20:56,725
- Very nice, sir.
- Big charity to-do up Portland way.

1169
01:20:56,810 --> 01:20:58,519
The Governor's going to be there.

1170
01:20:59,938 --> 01:21:01,981
Want the rest of this?

1171
01:21:02,065 --> 01:21:04,149
The woman can't bake worth shit.

1172
01:21:05,527 --> 01:21:07,319
Thank you, sir.

1173
01:21:09,489 --> 01:21:13,242
- He's got his fingers in a lot of pies, I hear.
- What you hear isn't half of it.

1174
01:21:13,326 --> 01:21:15,786
He's got scams you haven't even dreamed of.

1175
01:21:15,871 --> 01:21:17,913
Kickbacks on his kickbacks.

1176
01:21:17,998 --> 01:21:20,875
There's a river of dirty money
running through this place.

1177
01:21:20,959 --> 01:21:24,211
But the problem with having all that money
is you'll have to explain

1178
01:21:24,296 --> 01:21:26,881
- where it came from.
- That's where I come in.

1179
01:21:26,965 --> 01:21:29,466
I channel it, filter it, funnel it.

1180
01:21:29,551 --> 01:21:32,094
Stocks, securities, tax-free municipals.

1181
01:21:32,178 --> 01:21:34,847
I send that money out into the real world.

1182
01:21:34,931 --> 01:21:38,559
- And when it comes back...
- Clean as a virgin's honey pot, huh?

1183
01:21:38,643 --> 01:21:39,852
Cleaner.

1184
01:21:39,936 --> 01:21:43,564
By the time Norton retires,
I'll have made him a millionaire.

1185
01:21:46,318 --> 01:21:50,738
If they ever catch on, though, he's gonna
wind up in here wearing a number himself.

1186
01:21:50,822 --> 01:21:54,074
Now, Red, I thought you had
a little more faith in me than that.

1187
01:21:54,159 --> 01:21:57,453
I know you're good, Andy,
but all that paper leaves a trail.

1188
01:21:57,537 --> 01:22:00,539
Now, anybody gets curious,
the FBI, the IRS, whatever,

1189
01:22:00,624 --> 01:22:03,459
it's gonna lead to somebody.

1190
01:22:03,543 --> 01:22:05,502
Sure it is. But not to me.

1191
01:22:05,587 --> 01:22:07,588
And certainly not to the Warden.

1192
01:22:11,635 --> 01:22:12,927
All right. Who?

1193
01:22:13,011 --> 01:22:14,720
Randall Stevens.

1194
01:22:14,804 --> 01:22:15,971
Who?

1195
01:22:17,057 --> 01:22:21,769
The silent silent partner. He's the guilty one,
Your Honor. The man with the bank accounts.

1196
01:22:21,853 --> 01:22:24,021
That's where the filtering process starts.

1197
01:22:24,105 --> 01:22:27,274
If they trace anything,
it's just going to lead to him.

1198
01:22:27,359 --> 01:22:28,943
But who is he?

1199
01:22:29,027 --> 01:22:31,070
He's a phantom, an apparition.

1200
01:22:31,154 --> 01:22:33,113
Second cousin to Harvey the Rabbit.

1201
01:22:33,198 --> 01:22:35,366
I conjured him...

1202
01:22:35,450 --> 01:22:37,493
out of thin air.

1203
01:22:37,577 --> 01:22:40,412
He doesn't exist, except on paper.

1204
01:22:43,541 --> 01:22:45,918
Andy, you can’t just make a person up.

1205
01:22:46,002 --> 01:22:49,129
Sure you can, if you know how
the system works, where the cracks are.

1206
01:22:49,214 --> 01:22:52,716
It's amazing what you can accomplish by mail.

1207
01:22:52,801 --> 01:22:55,427
Mr. Stevens has a birth certificate,

1208
01:22:55,512 --> 01:22:57,846
a driver's license, social security number.

1209
01:22:57,931 --> 01:22:59,139
You're shitting me?

1210
01:22:59,224 --> 01:23:01,183
If they ever trace any of those accounts,

1211
01:23:01,267 --> 01:23:04,144
they're going to wind up chasing
a figment of my imagination.

1212
01:23:04,229 --> 01:23:06,313
Well, I'll be damned.

1213
01:23:07,607 --> 01:23:09,650
Did I say you were good?

1214
01:23:09,734 --> 01:23:11,902
Shit, you're a Rembrandt!

1215
01:23:11,987 --> 01:23:14,029
You know, the funny thing is,

1216
01:23:14,114 --> 01:23:18,075
on the outside, I was an honest man,
straight as an arrow.

1217
01:23:19,119 --> 01:23:21,495
I had to come to prison to be a crook.

1218
01:23:30,255 --> 01:23:31,630
Ever bother you?

1219
01:23:32,674 --> 01:23:36,093
I don't run the scams, Red,
I just process the profits.

1220
01:23:36,177 --> 01:23:38,220
Fine line maybe but...

1221
01:23:38,304 --> 01:23:41,015
I also built that library

1222
01:23:41,099 --> 01:23:43,726
and used it to help a dozen guys
get a high school diploma.

1223
01:23:43,810 --> 01:23:45,686
Why do you think the Warden lets me do it?

1224
01:23:45,770 --> 01:23:48,522
To keep you happy and doing the laundry.

1225
01:23:48,606 --> 01:23:50,733
Money instead of sheets.

1226
01:23:50,817 --> 01:23:53,527
Well, I work cheap. That's the trade-off.

1227
01:23:53,611 --> 01:23:55,696
(Siren wails)

1228
01:23:59,117 --> 01:24:01,326
♪ JOHNNY OTIS: Willy And The Hand Jive

1229
01:24:09,127 --> 01:24:10,919
♪ I know a cat named...

1230
01:24:11,004 --> 01:24:13,672
RED: Tommy Williams
came to Shawshank in 1965

1231
01:24:13,757 --> 01:24:15,799
on a two-year stretch for B&E.

1232
01:24:15,884 --> 01:24:18,010
That's breaking and entering to you.

1233
01:24:18,094 --> 01:24:22,723
The cops caught him sneaking TV sets
out the back door of a JC Penney.

1234
01:24:22,807 --> 01:24:24,558
Young punk.

1235
01:24:24,642 --> 01:24:26,685
Mr. Rock'n'roll.

1236
01:24:26,770 --> 01:24:28,437
Cocky as hell.

1237
01:24:28,521 --> 01:24:31,106
Hey, come on, old boys! Moving like molasses!

1238
01:24:31,191 --> 01:24:33,150
Making me look bad.

1239
01:24:33,151 --> 01:24:35,110
RED: We liked him immediately.

1240
01:24:35,195 --> 01:24:37,237
So I'm backing out the door, right?

1241
01:24:37,322 --> 01:24:39,031
And I got the TV like this.

1242
01:24:39,115 --> 01:24:42,951
It was a big old thing. I couldn't see shit.
Suddenly, I hears this voice.

1243
01:24:43,036 --> 01:24:45,079
"Freeze, kid! Hands in the air."

1244
01:24:45,163 --> 01:24:46,830
Well, I just stand there,

1245
01:24:46,915 --> 01:24:49,708
holding onto that TV. So, finally, the voice says,

1246
01:24:49,793 --> 01:24:51,752
"Do you hear what I said, boy?"

1247
01:24:51,836 --> 01:24:54,213
I say, "Yes, sir, I sure did.

1248
01:24:54,297 --> 01:24:57,925
But if I drop this fucking thing,
you got me on destruction of property, too."

1249
01:24:58,009 --> 01:25:00,135
(Laughter)

1250
01:25:02,013 --> 01:25:04,723
Hey, you've done a stretch in Cashman, right?

1251
01:25:04,808 --> 01:25:08,644
Yeah. Yeah, that was an easy piece of time,
let me tell you.

1252
01:25:08,728 --> 01:25:11,355
Weekend furloughs, work programs.

1253
01:25:11,439 --> 01:25:12,856
Not like here.

1254
01:25:12,941 --> 01:25:15,275
Sounds like you done time
all over New England.

1255
01:25:15,360 --> 01:25:20,447
Yeah, I've been in and out since I was 13. You
name the place, chances are I've been there.

1256
01:25:20,532 --> 01:25:24,535
Perhaps it's time you tried a new profession?

1257
01:25:24,619 --> 01:25:29,706
What I mean is, you don't seem to be a good
thief. Maybe you should try something else.

1258
01:25:29,791 --> 01:25:33,627
Yeah, well, what the hell
do you know about it, Capone?

1259
01:25:33,711 --> 01:25:35,462
What are you in for?

1260
01:25:35,547 --> 01:25:37,172
Me?

1261
01:25:38,675 --> 01:25:40,759
The lawyer fucked me.

1262
01:25:44,472 --> 01:25:47,891
Everybody's innocent in here.
Don't you know that?

1263
01:25:49,727 --> 01:25:52,271
(Laughter breaks out)

1264
01:25:55,358 --> 01:25:59,528
RED: As it turned out, Tommy had himself
a young wife and a new baby girl.

1265
01:26:00,572 --> 01:26:05,701
Maybe it was the thought of them on the streets
or his child growing up not knowing her daddy.

1266
01:26:05,785 --> 01:26:09,621
Whatever it was,
something lit a fire under that boy's ass.

1267
01:26:13,585 --> 01:26:16,837
I was thinking of maybe
trying for my high school equivalency.

1268
01:26:16,921 --> 01:26:19,506
I hear you helped a couple of fellas with that.

1269
01:26:20,717 --> 01:26:22,926
I don't waste time on losers, Tommy.

1270
01:26:24,512 --> 01:26:26,597
I ain't no goddamn loser.

1271
01:26:28,433 --> 01:26:30,517
- You mean that?
- Yeah.

1272
01:26:32,187 --> 01:26:34,229
You really mean that?

1273
01:26:34,314 --> 01:26:35,981
Yes, sir, I do.

1274
01:26:36,065 --> 01:26:38,192
Good. Because if we do this,

1275
01:26:38,276 --> 01:26:41,028
we do it all the way, 100%, nothing half-assed.

1276
01:26:42,155 --> 01:26:44,239
The thing is, see...

1277
01:26:45,408 --> 01:26:47,242
..I don't read so good.

1278
01:26:48,369 --> 01:26:49,578
Well.

1279
01:26:51,331 --> 01:26:53,373
You don't read...

1280
01:26:53,458 --> 01:26:55,542
so well.

1281
01:26:57,003 --> 01:26:58,670
We'll get to that.

1282
01:26:59,756 --> 01:27:01,506
- R.
- R...

1283
01:27:01,591 --> 01:27:02,966
- S.
- S...

1284
01:27:03,051 --> 01:27:05,219
RED: So Andy took Tommy under his wing.

1285
01:27:05,303 --> 01:27:07,721
He started walking him through his ABCs.

1286
01:27:09,390 --> 01:27:11,975
Tommy took to it pretty well, too.

1287
01:27:12,060 --> 01:27:15,020
The boy found brains he never knew he had.

1288
01:27:17,357 --> 01:27:21,151
Before long, Andy started him
on his course requirements.

1289
01:27:21,236 --> 01:27:23,195
He really liked the kid.

1290
01:27:23,279 --> 01:27:26,448
It gave him a thrill to help a youngster
crawl off the shit heap.

1291
01:27:27,492 --> 01:27:29,534
But that wasn't the only reason.

1292
01:27:29,619 --> 01:27:32,079
Prison time is slow time.

1293
01:27:33,122 --> 01:27:35,374
So you do what you can to keep going.

1294
01:27:35,458 --> 01:27:37,709
Some fellas collect stamps.

1295
01:27:37,710 --> 01:27:40,337
Others build matchstick houses.

1296
01:27:41,381 --> 01:27:43,757
Andy built a library.

1297
01:27:44,801 --> 01:27:46,843
Now he needed a new project.

1298
01:27:46,928 --> 01:27:48,971
Tommy was it.

1299
01:27:49,055 --> 01:27:53,267
It was the same reason he spent years
shaping and polishing those rocks.

1300
01:27:53,351 --> 01:27:56,979
The same reason
he hung his fantasy girlies on the wall.

1301
01:27:58,356 --> 01:27:59,856
In prison,

1302
01:27:59,941 --> 01:28:03,068
a man will do most anything
to keep his mind occupied.

1303
01:28:04,529 --> 01:28:08,991
By 1966, right about the time
Tommy was getting ready to take his exams,

1304
01:28:08,992 --> 01:28:11,034
it was lovely Raquel.

1305
01:28:13,413 --> 01:28:15,038
(Clock ticks)

1306
01:28:28,303 --> 01:28:29,344
Time.

1307
01:28:35,351 --> 01:28:36,643
Well?

1308
01:28:37,729 --> 01:28:39,271
Well, it's for shit.

1309
01:28:39,355 --> 01:28:41,857
I wasted a whole fucking year of my time

1310
01:28:41,941 --> 01:28:45,110
- with this bullshit.
- It's probably not as bad as you think.

1311
01:28:45,194 --> 01:28:48,905
It's worse. I didn't get one thing right.
It might as well have been in Chinese.

1312
01:28:48,990 --> 01:28:51,491
Let's see how the score comes out.

1313
01:28:51,576 --> 01:28:54,202
Well, I'll tell you how the goddamn score
comes out.

1314
01:28:55,997 --> 01:28:57,914
Two points right there.

1315
01:28:57,999 --> 01:28:59,791
There's your goddamn score!

1316
01:28:59,876 --> 01:29:03,712
Goddamn cats crawling up trees,
5x5 is 25.

1317
01:29:04,797 --> 01:29:06,340
Fuck this place!

1318
01:29:06,341 --> 01:29:07,632
Fuck it!

1319
01:29:26,444 --> 01:29:29,196
I feel bad. I let him down.

1320
01:29:29,280 --> 01:29:31,365
Ah, that's crap, kid.

1321
01:29:31,366 --> 01:29:32,908
He's proud of you.

1322
01:29:32,992 --> 01:29:36,119
We've been friends a long time
so I know him as good as anybody.

1323
01:29:36,204 --> 01:29:39,081
- A smart fellow, ain't he?
- As smart as they come.

1324
01:29:39,165 --> 01:29:41,208
He used to be a banker on the outside.

1325
01:29:41,292 --> 01:29:43,335
What's he in here for, anyway?

1326
01:29:43,419 --> 01:29:44,920
Murder.

1327
01:29:46,047 --> 01:29:47,798
The hell you say!

1328
01:29:49,926 --> 01:29:52,219
You wouldn't think it to look at the guy.

1329
01:29:53,262 --> 01:29:55,722
He caught his wife in bed with some golf pro.

1330
01:29:55,807 --> 01:29:57,891
He greased them both.

1331
01:30:05,775 --> 01:30:07,651
What?

1332
01:30:07,735 --> 01:30:10,112
About four years ago,

1333
01:30:10,196 --> 01:30:13,281
I was in Thomaston on a two-to-three stretch.

1334
01:30:14,534 --> 01:30:17,619
I stole a car. It was a dumb-fuck thing to do.

1335
01:30:18,913 --> 01:30:20,956
About six months left to go,

1336
01:30:21,040 --> 01:30:23,083
I get a new cellmate in.

1337
01:30:23,167 --> 01:30:25,043
Elmo Blatch.

1338
01:30:26,087 --> 01:30:27,671
Big, twitchy fucker.

1339
01:30:27,672 --> 01:30:29,965
Kind of roomie you pray you don't get.

1340
01:30:30,049 --> 01:30:32,092
You know what I'm saying?

1341
01:30:32,176 --> 01:30:34,219
Six-to-twelve, armed burglary.

1342
01:30:34,303 --> 01:30:37,514
He said he'd pulled hundreds of jobs.

1343
01:30:37,598 --> 01:30:39,474
Hard to believe, high-strung as he was.

1344
01:30:39,559 --> 01:30:42,561
You'd cut a loud fart,
he'd jump three feet in the air.

1345
01:30:43,688 --> 01:30:45,730
Talked all the time, too.

1346
01:30:45,815 --> 01:30:48,150
That's the other thing. He never shut up.

1347
01:30:48,234 --> 01:30:50,277
Places he'd been in,

1348
01:30:50,361 --> 01:30:53,029
jobs he'd pulled, women he'd fucked.

1349
01:30:53,114 --> 01:30:55,532
Even people he'd killed.

1350
01:30:57,368 --> 01:30:59,744
People who gave him shit.

1351
01:31:00,788 --> 01:31:02,831
That's how he put it.

1352
01:31:02,915 --> 01:31:04,458
So...

1353
01:31:04,542 --> 01:31:06,626
one night, like a joke,

1354
01:31:07,670 --> 01:31:10,964
I say to him, I say,
"Yeah, Elmo, who did you kill?"

1355
01:31:11,048 --> 01:31:12,841
So he says...

1356
01:31:12,925 --> 01:31:16,553
I got me this job one time
bussing tables at a country club.

1357
01:31:17,680 --> 01:31:21,266
So I could case
all these big rich pricks that come in.

1358
01:31:23,686 --> 01:31:25,687
So I pick out this guy,

1359
01:31:26,731 --> 01:31:29,316
go in one night and do his place.

1360
01:31:31,486 --> 01:31:33,487
He wakes up.

1361
01:31:33,571 --> 01:31:35,614
He gives me shit.

1362
01:31:36,657 --> 01:31:38,742
So I killed him.

1363
01:31:39,785 --> 01:31:41,870
Him and this tasty bitch he was with.

1364
01:31:44,165 --> 01:31:46,082
That's the best part.

1365
01:31:47,126 --> 01:31:50,337
She's fucking this prick, see, this golf pro.

1366
01:31:50,421 --> 01:31:52,506
But she's married to some other guy.

1367
01:31:53,549 --> 01:31:55,634
Some hotshot banker.

1368
01:31:57,428 --> 01:31:59,513
And he's the one they pinned it on.

1369
01:32:10,650 --> 01:32:14,486
I have to say
that's the most amazing story I ever heard.

1370
01:32:16,113 --> 01:32:18,990
What amazes me most is
you were taken in by it.

1371
01:32:19,075 --> 01:32:20,700
Sir?

1372
01:32:20,785 --> 01:32:22,452
Well...

1373
01:32:22,537 --> 01:32:25,914
it's obvious this fella Williams
is impressed with you.

1374
01:32:25,998 --> 01:32:28,083
He hears your tale of woe

1375
01:32:28,167 --> 01:32:31,086
and quite naturally wants to cheer you up.

1376
01:32:31,170 --> 01:32:33,213
He's young, not terribly bright.

1377
01:32:33,297 --> 01:32:37,175
Not surprising he wouldn't know
what a state he'd put you in.

1378
01:32:37,260 --> 01:32:39,386
Sir, he's telling the truth.

1379
01:32:39,470 --> 01:32:43,515
Well, let's say, for the moment,
this Blatch does exist.

1380
01:32:43,599 --> 01:32:46,726
You think he'd just fall to his knees and cry,

1381
01:32:46,811 --> 01:32:49,020
"Yes, I did it! I confess!

1382
01:32:49,105 --> 01:32:51,314
And by the way,
add a life term to my sentence"?

1383
01:32:51,399 --> 01:32:54,568
That doesn't matter.
With Tommy's testimony, I can get a new trial.

1384
01:32:54,652 --> 01:32:57,862
That's assuming Blatch is even still there.

1385
01:32:57,947 --> 01:32:59,990
The chances are he'd be released by now.

1386
01:33:00,074 --> 01:33:02,659
They'd have his last address,
names of relatives.

1387
01:33:02,743 --> 01:33:04,911
There's a chance, isn't there?

1388
01:33:06,956 --> 01:33:08,832
How can you be so obtuse?

1389
01:33:08,916 --> 01:33:10,417
What?

1390
01:33:11,919 --> 01:33:13,753
What did you call me?

1391
01:33:13,838 --> 01:33:15,672
Obtuse. Is it deliberate?

1392
01:33:15,756 --> 01:33:17,549
Son, you're forgetting yourself.

1393
01:33:17,633 --> 01:33:20,468
The country club will have his old timecards,

1394
01:33:20,553 --> 01:33:22,679
records, W-2s,

1395
01:33:22,763 --> 01:33:26,766
- with his name on them.
- If you indulge this fantasy, that's your business.

1396
01:33:26,851 --> 01:33:30,812
- Don't make it mine. This meeting is over.
- Sir, if I were to ever get out,

1397
01:33:30,896 --> 01:33:35,900
I would never mention what goes on in here.
I'd be as indictable as you for laundering money.

1398
01:33:37,695 --> 01:33:40,697
Don't ever mention money to me again,
you sorry son of a bitch!

1399
01:33:40,781 --> 01:33:42,657
Not in this office.

1400
01:33:42,658 --> 01:33:44,784
Not anywhere! Get in here now.

1401
01:33:44,869 --> 01:33:48,121
I'm just trying to set your mind at ease,
that's all. Sir, I...

1402
01:33:48,205 --> 01:33:49,581
Solitary. A month.

1403
01:33:49,665 --> 01:33:51,833
- Yes, sir.
- What's the matter with you?

1404
01:33:51,917 --> 01:33:55,170
- Get him out of here.
- This is my chance to get out! Don't you see?

1405
01:33:55,171 --> 01:33:57,172
It's my life! Don't you understand?

1406
01:33:57,256 --> 01:33:59,716
- Get him out! Get him out!
- This is my life!

1407
01:33:59,800 --> 01:34:01,051
No!

1408
01:34:01,135 --> 01:34:02,969
A month in the hole.

1409
01:34:03,054 --> 01:34:05,639
It's the longest damn stretch I ever heard of.

1410
01:34:05,723 --> 01:34:07,515
It's all my fault.

1411
01:34:07,600 --> 01:34:09,017
Oh, bullshit.

1412
01:34:09,101 --> 01:34:12,395
You didn't pull the trigger
and you certainly didn't convict him.

1413
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:14,856
Red, are you saying that Andy is innocent?

1414
01:34:14,940 --> 01:34:17,108
I mean, for real innocent?

1415
01:34:17,193 --> 01:34:19,235
It looks that way.

1416
01:34:19,320 --> 01:34:21,363
Sweet Jesus.

1417
01:34:21,447 --> 01:34:23,490
How long's he been here now?

1418
01:34:23,574 --> 01:34:25,617
1947. What is that?

1419
01:34:25,701 --> 01:34:27,243
- 19 years.
TOMMY: 19 years...

1420
01:34:27,328 --> 01:34:29,954
GUARD: Williams, Thomas.
- Yeah, over here.

1421
01:34:32,333 --> 01:34:34,584
- Paxon, Edward.
- Yeah.

1422
01:34:35,795 --> 01:34:38,713
What you got? Board of Education.

1423
01:34:38,798 --> 01:34:41,466
- The son of a bitch mailed it.
- Looks like he did.

1424
01:34:41,550 --> 01:34:44,594
Are you gonna open it or stand there
with your thumb up your butt?

1425
01:34:44,679 --> 01:34:46,763
The thumb up my butt sounds better.

1426
01:34:47,807 --> 01:34:50,558
Hey, Skeet, come on,
give me that, you shithead.

1427
01:34:51,602 --> 01:34:53,812
- Floyd, come on.
- Over here, over here!

1428
01:34:54,855 --> 01:34:56,940
Hey, Red!

1429
01:34:58,067 --> 01:35:00,485
Come on, will you throw that away, please?

1430
01:35:06,075 --> 01:35:08,159
Well, shit.

1431
01:35:20,381 --> 01:35:23,091
The kid passed. C+ average.

1432
01:35:23,175 --> 01:35:25,260
Thought you'd like to know.

1433
01:35:41,819 --> 01:35:43,903
The Warden wants to talk.

1434
01:35:57,293 --> 01:35:58,418
Out here?

1435
01:35:58,502 --> 01:36:00,587
That's what the man said.

1436
01:36:16,896 --> 01:36:18,688
Warden?

1437
01:36:18,773 --> 01:36:20,857
Tommy.

1438
01:36:26,322 --> 01:36:27,781
Tommy...

1439
01:36:27,865 --> 01:36:31,951
I'm asking you to keep this conversation
just between us.

1440
01:36:33,370 --> 01:36:35,455
I feel awkward enough as it is.

1441
01:36:53,933 --> 01:36:56,017
We got a situation here.

1442
01:36:57,061 --> 01:36:59,103
I think you can appreciate that.

1443
01:36:59,188 --> 01:37:00,647
Yes, sir.

1444
01:37:00,731 --> 01:37:02,232
I sure can.

1445
01:37:02,316 --> 01:37:06,361
I tell you, son, this thing really came along
and knocked my wind out.

1446
01:37:08,072 --> 01:37:10,615
It's got me up nights, that's the truth.

1447
01:37:12,827 --> 01:37:14,911
The right thing to do.

1448
01:37:16,247 --> 01:37:19,249
Sometimes it's hard to know what that is.

1449
01:37:20,960 --> 01:37:23,002
You understand?

1450
01:37:24,380 --> 01:37:26,464
I need your help, son.

1451
01:37:27,883 --> 01:37:29,968
If I'm going to move on this,

1452
01:37:29,969 --> 01:37:32,720
there can't be the least little shred of doubt.

1453
01:37:34,265 --> 01:37:37,684
I have to know
if what you told Dufresne was the truth.

1454
01:37:37,768 --> 01:37:39,352
Yes, sir.

1455
01:37:39,353 --> 01:37:40,979
Absolutely.

1456
01:37:41,063 --> 01:37:44,148
Would you be willing
to swear before a judge and jury,

1457
01:37:44,233 --> 01:37:46,651
having placed your hand on the Good Book

1458
01:37:46,652 --> 01:37:49,362
and taken an oath before Almighty God himself?

1459
01:37:49,446 --> 01:37:51,573
Just give me that chance.

1460
01:37:55,494 --> 01:37:57,161
That's what I thought.

1461
01:38:29,612 --> 01:38:31,696
(Keys rattle)

1462
01:38:44,251 --> 01:38:46,336
I'm sure by now you've heard...

1463
01:38:47,588 --> 01:38:48,963
A terrible thing.

1464
01:38:50,424 --> 01:38:54,010
A man that young, less than a year to go,
trying to escape.

1465
01:38:55,095 --> 01:38:57,722
It broke Captain Hadley's heart to shoot him.

1466
01:38:58,766 --> 01:39:00,850
Truly, it did.

1467
01:39:02,895 --> 01:39:04,979
We just have to put it behind us.

1468
01:39:07,149 --> 01:39:08,566
Move on.

1469
01:39:10,027 --> 01:39:11,903
I'm done.

1470
01:39:12,947 --> 01:39:15,031
Everything stops.

1471
01:39:16,075 --> 01:39:18,910
Get someone else to run your scams.

1472
01:39:20,245 --> 01:39:22,330
Nothing stops.

1473
01:39:23,374 --> 01:39:25,458
Nothing.

1474
01:39:27,211 --> 01:39:29,295
Or you will do the hardest time there is.

1475
01:39:31,173 --> 01:39:33,758
No more protection from the guards.

1476
01:39:33,842 --> 01:39:36,177
I'll pull you out of that one-bunk Hilton

1477
01:39:36,261 --> 01:39:38,429
and cast you down with the Sodomites.

1478
01:39:40,182 --> 01:39:42,684
You'll think you've been fucked by a train.

1479
01:39:43,978 --> 01:39:46,020
And the library?

1480
01:39:46,105 --> 01:39:47,230
Gone.

1481
01:39:47,314 --> 01:39:49,691
Sealed off, brick by brick.

1482
01:39:50,734 --> 01:39:53,528
We'll have us a little book barbecue in the yard.

1483
01:39:53,612 --> 01:39:55,655
They'll see the flames for miles.

1484
01:39:55,739 --> 01:39:58,241
We'll dance around it like wild Injuns.

1485
01:39:59,827 --> 01:40:01,744
You understand me?

1486
01:40:01,829 --> 01:40:03,913
Catching my drift?

1487
01:40:07,001 --> 01:40:09,085
Or am I being obtuse?

1488
01:40:20,222 --> 01:40:22,348
Give him another month to think about it.

1489
01:40:30,858 --> 01:40:32,942
(Lock clicks)

1490
01:41:09,938 --> 01:41:12,982
My wife used to say I'm a hard man to know.

1491
01:41:13,067 --> 01:41:15,151
Like a closed book.

1492
01:41:16,361 --> 01:41:19,113
Complained about it all the time.

1493
01:41:19,198 --> 01:41:21,282
She was beautiful.

1494
01:41:23,494 --> 01:41:25,578
God, I loved her.

1495
01:41:28,582 --> 01:41:30,917
I just didn't know how to show it, that's all.

1496
01:41:33,420 --> 01:41:35,505
I killed her, Red.

1497
01:41:36,965 --> 01:41:39,050
I didn't pull the trigger.

1498
01:41:40,469 --> 01:41:42,553
But I drove her away.

1499
01:41:43,764 --> 01:41:46,307
That's why she died, because of me.

1500
01:41:46,391 --> 01:41:48,476
The way I am.

1501
01:41:56,819 --> 01:41:58,903
That don't make you a murderer.

1502
01:42:02,116 --> 01:42:04,200
A bad husband, maybe.

1503
01:42:07,579 --> 01:42:10,957
Feel bad about it if you want to,
but you didn't pull the trigger.

1504
01:42:11,041 --> 01:42:12,458
No, I didn't.

1505
01:42:12,543 --> 01:42:14,585
Somebody else did.

1506
01:42:15,879 --> 01:42:17,964
And I wound up in here.

1507
01:42:20,342 --> 01:42:22,426
Bad luck, I guess.

1508
01:42:25,347 --> 01:42:27,056
Yeah.

1509
01:42:27,141 --> 01:42:29,433
It floats around.

1510
01:42:29,518 --> 01:42:31,978
It's got to land on somebody.

1511
01:42:32,062 --> 01:42:34,313
It was my turn, that's all.

1512
01:42:35,399 --> 01:42:37,859
I was in the path of the tornado.

1513
01:42:44,449 --> 01:42:48,202
I just didn't expect
the storm would last as long as it has.

1514
01:42:52,291 --> 01:42:54,208
Do you think you'll ever get out of here?

1515
01:42:55,460 --> 01:42:57,128
Me?

1516
01:42:59,423 --> 01:43:00,882
Yeah.

1517
01:43:01,925 --> 01:43:03,885
One day, when I've got a long, white beard

1518
01:43:03,969 --> 01:43:07,471
and two or three marbles rolling around upstairs,
they'll let me out.

1519
01:43:09,391 --> 01:43:11,475
I tell you where I'd go.

1520
01:43:12,686 --> 01:43:14,312
Zihuatanejo.

1521
01:43:14,396 --> 01:43:16,314
Zi...what?

1522
01:43:16,398 --> 01:43:18,441
Zihuatanejo.

1523
01:43:18,525 --> 01:43:20,610
It's in Mexico.

1524
01:43:22,404 --> 01:43:24,614
A little place on the Pacific Ocean.

1525
01:43:25,866 --> 01:43:28,242
You know what the Mexicans say
about the Pacific?

1526
01:43:28,327 --> 01:43:29,785
No.

1527
01:43:29,870 --> 01:43:31,954
They say it has no memory.

1528
01:43:34,416 --> 01:43:36,959
That's where I want to live the rest of my life.

1529
01:43:38,545 --> 01:43:40,630
A warm place with no memory.

1530
01:43:43,926 --> 01:43:46,219
Open up a little hotel,

1531
01:43:48,055 --> 01:43:49,931
right on the beach.

1532
01:43:50,015 --> 01:43:52,058
Buy some worthless old boat,

1533
01:43:52,142 --> 01:43:54,227
fix it up new.

1534
01:43:57,189 --> 01:43:58,397
Take my guests out.

1535
01:43:58,482 --> 01:44:00,566
Charter fishing.

1536
01:44:04,488 --> 01:44:07,114
Zihuatanejo, huh?

1537
01:44:09,743 --> 01:44:13,621
In a place like that, I could use a man
who knows how to get things.

1538
01:44:20,045 --> 01:44:22,755
I don't think I could make it on the outside, Andy.

1539
01:44:29,513 --> 01:44:31,597
I've been in here most of my life.

1540
01:44:33,100 --> 01:44:34,892
I'm an institutional man now.

1541
01:44:34,977 --> 01:44:37,061
Just like Brooks was.

1542
01:44:38,480 --> 01:44:40,731
Well, you underestimate yourself.

1543
01:44:40,816 --> 01:44:42,900
I don't think so.

1544
01:44:45,529 --> 01:44:49,740
I mean...in here, I'm the guy
who can get things for you, sure.

1545
01:44:49,825 --> 01:44:53,744
But outside, all you need is the Yellow Pages.

1546
01:44:53,829 --> 01:44:56,247
Hell, I wouldn't even know where to begin.

1547
01:44:58,333 --> 01:45:00,668
The Pacific Ocean?

1548
01:45:00,752 --> 01:45:02,795
Shit.

1549
01:45:02,879 --> 01:45:06,048
- About scare me to death, something that big.
- Not me.

1550
01:45:06,133 --> 01:45:09,593
I didn't shoot my wife and I didn't shoot her lover.

1551
01:45:11,513 --> 01:45:15,141
Whatever mistakes I've made,
I've paid for them and then some.

1552
01:45:15,225 --> 01:45:17,393
That hotel, that boat.

1553
01:45:18,979 --> 01:45:21,147
I don't think that's too much to ask.

1554
01:45:25,777 --> 01:45:28,654
I don't think you ought to be
doing this to yourself, Andy.

1555
01:45:28,739 --> 01:45:30,781
These are just shitty pipe dreams.

1556
01:45:30,866 --> 01:45:33,826
I mean, Mexico is way the hell down there
and you're in here.

1557
01:45:33,910 --> 01:45:35,953
And that's the way it is.

1558
01:45:36,038 --> 01:45:38,664
Yeah, right. That's the way it is.

1559
01:45:40,417 --> 01:45:42,501
It's down there and I'm in here.

1560
01:45:45,213 --> 01:45:48,007
I guess it comes down to a simple choice, really.

1561
01:45:50,844 --> 01:45:52,887
Get busy living

1562
01:45:52,971 --> 01:45:55,890
or get busy dying.

1563
01:45:59,686 --> 01:46:01,771
Andy.

1564
01:46:04,232 --> 01:46:06,317
Red.

1565
01:46:07,361 --> 01:46:09,779
If you ever get out of here, do me a favor.

1566
01:46:09,863 --> 01:46:11,697
Sure, Andy.

1567
01:46:11,782 --> 01:46:13,115
Anything.

1568
01:46:14,201 --> 01:46:17,661
There's a big hayfield up near Buxton.
You know where Buxton is?

1569
01:46:19,664 --> 01:46:23,459
- Well, just... There's a lot of hayfields up there.
- One in particular.

1570
01:46:23,543 --> 01:46:25,586
It's got a long rock wall

1571
01:46:25,670 --> 01:46:27,588
with a big oak tree at the north end.

1572
01:46:27,672 --> 01:46:30,383
It's like something out of a Robert Frost poem.

1573
01:46:31,760 --> 01:46:34,470
It's where I asked my wife to marry me.

1574
01:46:35,680 --> 01:46:39,475
We went there for a picnic
and made love under that oak.

1575
01:46:40,977 --> 01:46:43,062
I asked and she said yes.

1576
01:46:47,192 --> 01:46:49,235
Promise me, Red,

1577
01:46:49,319 --> 01:46:51,320
if you ever get out,

1578
01:46:51,405 --> 01:46:53,447
find that spot.

1579
01:46:54,491 --> 01:46:59,954
At the base of that wall, you'll find a rock that has
no earthly business in a Maine hayfield.

1580
01:47:00,038 --> 01:47:02,540
A piece of black, volcanic glass.

1581
01:47:05,710 --> 01:47:08,504
There's something buried under it
I want you to have.

1582
01:47:08,588 --> 01:47:10,589
What, Andy?

1583
01:47:10,674 --> 01:47:12,758
What's buried under there?

1584
01:47:14,553 --> 01:47:17,930
You'll have to pry it up to see.

1585
01:47:23,270 --> 01:47:25,354
No, I'm telling you, the guy is...

1586
01:47:26,398 --> 01:47:28,482
He's talking funnier.

1587
01:47:28,567 --> 01:47:31,944
- I'm really worried about him.
- We ought to keep an eye on him.

1588
01:47:32,028 --> 01:47:36,073
That's fine during the day,
but at night he's got that cell all to himself.

1589
01:47:37,159 --> 01:47:38,617
Oh, Lord.

1590
01:47:38,702 --> 01:47:40,744
What?

1591
01:47:42,414 --> 01:47:44,748
Andy come down to the loading dock today.

1592
01:47:44,833 --> 01:47:48,335
- He asked me for a length of rope.
- Rope?

1593
01:47:48,420 --> 01:47:50,254
Six feet long.

1594
01:47:50,338 --> 01:47:51,797
And you gave it to him?

1595
01:47:51,882 --> 01:47:54,550
Sure I did. Why wouldn't I?

1596
01:47:54,551 --> 01:47:56,260
Jesus, Heywood.

1597
01:47:56,344 --> 01:47:58,596
Hey, how the hell was I supposed to know?

1598
01:47:58,680 --> 01:48:00,598
Remember Brooks Hatlen?

1599
01:48:00,682 --> 01:48:01,724
No.

1600
01:48:02,767 --> 01:48:04,977
Andy would never do that.

1601
01:48:04,978 --> 01:48:07,062
Never.

1602
01:48:08,106 --> 01:48:10,191
I don't know.

1603
01:48:12,235 --> 01:48:14,320
Every man has his breaking point.

1604
01:48:16,948 --> 01:48:18,199
Lickety-split.

1605
01:48:18,283 --> 01:48:21,160
- I want to get home.
- Just about finished, sir.

1606
01:48:37,260 --> 01:48:39,345
Three deposits tonight.

1607
01:48:47,729 --> 01:48:49,813
Get my stuff down to the laundry.

1608
01:48:49,814 --> 01:48:53,275
And shine my shoes.
I want 'em looking like mirrors.

1609
01:48:53,360 --> 01:48:54,735
Yes, sir.

1610
01:49:00,033 --> 01:49:01,700
It's good having you back, Andy.

1611
01:49:01,785 --> 01:49:04,537
The place wasn't the same without you.

1612
01:49:06,665 --> 01:49:08,749
(Whistles)

1613
01:49:51,585 --> 01:49:54,336
GUARD: Lights out!
(Click of light switches)

1614
01:49:58,633 --> 01:50:00,718
(Footsteps)

1615
01:50:06,600 --> 01:50:08,684
(Outer door closes)

1616
01:50:25,076 --> 01:50:27,369
RED: I've had some long nights in stir.

1617
01:50:28,413 --> 01:50:31,123
Alone in the dark with nothing but your thoughts,

1618
01:50:31,207 --> 01:50:33,042
time can draw out like a blade.

1619
01:50:33,043 --> 01:50:35,127
(Thunder rumbles)

1620
01:50:39,424 --> 01:50:41,759
That was the longest night of my life.

1621
01:50:51,978 --> 01:50:54,313
(Gate buzzer)

1622
01:50:57,901 --> 01:50:59,526
GUARD: Give me a count.

1623
01:51:03,865 --> 01:51:05,908
Tier 3 South. Clear.

1624
01:51:05,992 --> 01:51:07,326
Tier 4 North. Clear.

1625
01:51:07,410 --> 01:51:10,996
- Tier 3 North. Clear.
- Man missing on Tier 2.

1626
01:51:11,081 --> 01:51:14,166
- Cell 245.
- Dufresne.

1627
01:51:14,250 --> 01:51:17,169
Get your ass out here, boy.
You're holding up the show.

1628
01:51:19,673 --> 01:51:23,717
Don't make me come down there.
I'll thump your skull for you.

1629
01:51:31,309 --> 01:51:34,687
Damn it, Dufresne, you're putting me behind!
I got a schedule to keep.

1630
01:51:34,771 --> 01:51:37,856
You'd better be sick or dead in there,
I shit you not!

1631
01:51:37,941 --> 01:51:39,775
You hear me?

1632
01:51:46,282 --> 01:51:48,367
Oh, my holy God.

1633
01:52:00,463 --> 01:52:02,548
(Siren wails)

1634
01:52:05,218 --> 01:52:07,928
I want every man on this cell block questioned.

1635
01:52:07,929 --> 01:52:10,139
- Start with that friend of his.
- Who?

1636
01:52:10,223 --> 01:52:11,432
Him!

1637
01:52:13,351 --> 01:52:15,436
Open 237.

1638
01:52:18,440 --> 01:52:20,566
What do you mean, he just wasn't here?

1639
01:52:20,650 --> 01:52:22,192
Don't say that to me, Haig.

1640
01:52:22,277 --> 01:52:24,528
Don't say that to me again.

1641
01:52:24,612 --> 01:52:25,696
But, sir, he wasn't.

1642
01:52:25,780 --> 01:52:27,948
I can see that, Haig!

1643
01:52:28,032 --> 01:52:29,825
You think I'm blind?

1644
01:52:29,826 --> 01:52:32,953
Is that what you're saying? Am I blind, Haig?

1645
01:52:33,037 --> 01:52:34,037
No, sir.

1646
01:52:34,122 --> 01:52:36,165
What about you?

1647
01:52:36,249 --> 01:52:38,083
Are you blind?

1648
01:52:38,168 --> 01:52:40,711
- Tell me what this is.
- Last night's count.

1649
01:52:40,795 --> 01:52:44,089
You see Dufresne's name there?
I sure do. See? Right there.

1650
01:52:44,174 --> 01:52:46,049
Dufresne.

1651
01:52:47,302 --> 01:52:48,969
He was in his cell at lights out.

1652
01:52:49,053 --> 01:52:52,264
It stands to reason
he'd still be here in the morning.

1653
01:52:53,349 --> 01:52:55,225
I want him found.

1654
01:52:55,310 --> 01:52:57,895
Not tomorrow, not after breakfast.

1655
01:52:57,979 --> 01:52:59,021
Now!

1656
01:52:59,022 --> 01:53:00,522
Yes, sir!

1657
01:53:01,649 --> 01:53:04,234
Let's go, let's go!
Move your butts! Move it!

1658
01:53:07,071 --> 01:53:08,113
Stand.

1659
01:53:09,240 --> 01:53:10,491
Well?

1660
01:53:13,870 --> 01:53:14,995
Well, what?

1661
01:53:15,079 --> 01:53:18,540
I see you two all the time.
You're thick as thieves, you are.

1662
01:53:19,584 --> 01:53:21,210
He must have said something.

1663
01:53:21,294 --> 01:53:23,337
No, sir, Warden.

1664
01:53:23,421 --> 01:53:24,880
Not a word.

1665
01:53:26,883 --> 01:53:28,884
Lord, it's a miracle!

1666
01:53:29,928 --> 01:53:32,387
A man up and vanished like a fart in the wind.

1667
01:53:32,472 --> 01:53:34,223
Nothing left but...

1668
01:53:34,307 --> 01:53:37,226
some damn rocks on a windowsill.

1669
01:53:37,310 --> 01:53:39,061
And that cupcake on the wall.

1670
01:53:39,145 --> 01:53:40,771
Let's ask her.

1671
01:53:40,855 --> 01:53:44,817
Maybe she knows. What say there,
Fuzzy Britches? Feel like talking?

1672
01:53:45,902 --> 01:53:46,985
Ah...

1673
01:53:46,986 --> 01:53:48,445
I guess not.

1674
01:53:48,530 --> 01:53:51,406
Why should she be any different?

1675
01:53:51,491 --> 01:53:53,951
This is a conspiracy.

1676
01:53:54,035 --> 01:53:56,245
That's what this is.

1677
01:53:56,329 --> 01:53:57,871
One big...

1678
01:53:57,956 --> 01:54:00,707
damn conspiracy!

1679
01:54:00,792 --> 01:54:03,460
And everyone's in on it!

1680
01:54:03,545 --> 01:54:04,837
Including her!

1681
01:54:06,172 --> 01:54:07,840
(Clattering)

1682
01:54:31,614 --> 01:54:33,323
(Sirens blare)

1683
01:54:39,497 --> 01:54:41,373
RED: In 1966,

1684
01:54:41,457 --> 01:54:44,126
Andy Dufresne escaped

1685
01:54:44,210 --> 01:54:46,295
from Shawshank Prison.

1686
01:54:47,964 --> 01:54:50,716
All they found of him
was a muddy set of prison clothes,

1687
01:54:50,800 --> 01:54:52,843
a bar of soap

1688
01:54:52,927 --> 01:54:57,306
and an old rock hammer
damn near worn down to the nub.

1689
01:55:01,686 --> 01:55:06,523
I remember thinking it would take a man
600 years to tunnel through the wall with it.

1690
01:55:06,608 --> 01:55:09,318
Old Andy did it in less than 20.

1691
01:55:27,879 --> 01:55:29,963
Oh, Andy loved geology.

1692
01:55:31,007 --> 01:55:34,509
I imagine it appealed to his meticulous nature.

1693
01:55:34,594 --> 01:55:36,887
An Ice Age here,

1694
01:55:36,971 --> 01:55:39,556
a million years of mountain-building there.

1695
01:55:40,600 --> 01:55:43,018
Geology is the study of pressure and time.

1696
01:55:44,228 --> 01:55:46,271
That's all it takes, really.

1697
01:55:46,356 --> 01:55:48,398
Pressure...

1698
01:55:48,483 --> 01:55:50,359
and time.

1699
01:55:50,443 --> 01:55:53,779
That and a big goddamn poster.

1700
01:55:54,864 --> 01:55:56,907
(Coughing)

1701
01:55:56,991 --> 01:55:58,367
Like I said,

1702
01:55:58,368 --> 01:56:02,162
in prison, a man will do most anything
to keep his mind occupied.

1703
01:56:04,958 --> 01:56:10,128
It turns out Andy's favorite hobby
was toting his wall out into the exercise yard.

1704
01:56:10,213 --> 01:56:12,297
A handful at a time.

1705
01:56:14,133 --> 01:56:16,301
I guess after Tommy was killed,

1706
01:56:16,386 --> 01:56:19,221
Andy decided he'd been here
just about long enough.

1707
01:56:19,305 --> 01:56:21,515
Lickety-split. I want to get home.

1708
01:56:22,809 --> 01:56:24,893
I'm just about finished, sir.

1709
01:56:46,290 --> 01:56:48,375
Three deposits tonight.

1710
01:56:55,550 --> 01:56:57,592
Andy did like he was told.

1711
01:56:58,636 --> 01:57:02,139
Buffed those shoes to a high mirror shine.

1712
01:57:05,727 --> 01:57:07,769
The guard simply didn't notice.

1713
01:57:07,854 --> 01:57:09,896
Neither did I.

1714
01:57:09,981 --> 01:57:14,317
I mean, seriously, how often
do you really look at a man's shoes?

1715
01:57:49,020 --> 01:57:51,104
(Thunderclap)

1716
01:59:18,359 --> 01:59:24,531
Andy crawled to freedom through 500 yards
of shit-smelling foulness I can't even imagine.

1717
01:59:24,615 --> 01:59:25,782
(Gags)

1718
01:59:25,867 --> 01:59:27,868
Or maybe I just don't want to.

1719
01:59:27,952 --> 01:59:30,036
(Coughs and spits)

1720
01:59:32,582 --> 01:59:34,791
500 yards.

1721
01:59:35,835 --> 01:59:38,336
That's the length of five football fields.

1722
01:59:39,380 --> 01:59:41,631
Just shy of half a mile.

1723
02:00:23,174 --> 02:00:24,883
(Laughs)

1724
02:00:36,854 --> 02:00:41,399
The next morning, right about the time
Raquel was spilling her little secret,

1725
02:00:41,484 --> 02:00:44,903
a man nobody ever laid eyes on before

1726
02:00:44,987 --> 02:00:47,405
strode into the Maine National Bank.

1727
02:00:47,490 --> 02:00:49,532
Until that moment,

1728
02:00:49,617 --> 02:00:51,493
he didn't exist,

1729
02:00:51,577 --> 02:00:52,911
except on paper.

1730
02:00:52,995 --> 02:00:54,037
May I help you?

1731
02:00:54,121 --> 02:00:56,164
RED: He had all the proper ID,

1732
02:00:56,249 --> 02:00:59,876
driver's license, birth certificate,
social security card.

1733
02:00:59,961 --> 02:01:03,255
And the signature was a spot-on match.

1734
02:01:03,339 --> 02:01:06,383
I must say, I'm sorry to be losing your business.

1735
02:01:06,467 --> 02:01:08,468
I hope you'll enjoy living abroad.

1736
02:01:08,552 --> 02:01:10,345
Thank you.

1737
02:01:10,429 --> 02:01:12,222
I'm sure I will.

1738
02:01:12,306 --> 02:01:14,432
Here's your cashier's check, sir.

1739
02:01:14,517 --> 02:01:16,559
Will there be anything else?

1740
02:01:16,644 --> 02:01:17,644
Please...

1741
02:01:17,728 --> 02:01:20,814
Would you add this to your outgoing mail?

1742
02:01:20,898 --> 02:01:23,108
I'd be happy to.

1743
02:01:23,192 --> 02:01:25,527
- Good day, sir.
- Good day.

1744
02:01:25,611 --> 02:01:30,407
RED: Mr. Stevens visited nearly a dozen banks
in the Portland area that morning.

1745
02:01:31,575 --> 02:01:38,039
All told, he blew town with better than $370,000
of Warden Norton's money.

1746
02:01:38,124 --> 02:01:40,583
Severance pay for 19 years.

1747
02:01:40,668 --> 02:01:42,752
(Phone rings)

1748
02:01:48,718 --> 02:01:51,011
Good morning, Portland Daily Bugle.

1749
02:01:58,686 --> 02:02:00,770
(Sirens wail)

1750
02:02:29,967 --> 02:02:32,010
(Sirens approaching)

1751
02:02:43,731 --> 02:02:46,733
Byron Hadley?
You have the right to remain silent.

1752
02:02:46,817 --> 02:02:51,446
If you give up the right to remain silent, anything
you say will be held against you in court.

1753
02:02:51,530 --> 02:02:53,406
RED: I wasn't there to see it.

1754
02:02:53,491 --> 02:02:58,370
But I hear Byron Hadley started sobbing
like a little girl when they took him away.

1755
02:03:03,793 --> 02:03:06,586
Norton had no intention of going that quietly.

1756
02:03:22,561 --> 02:03:24,020
Samuel Norton?

1757
02:03:24,105 --> 02:03:27,357
- We have a warrant for your arrest. Open up.
(Banging on door)

1758
02:03:30,236 --> 02:03:31,361
Norton!

1759
02:03:31,445 --> 02:03:33,113
Open the door.

1760
02:03:33,197 --> 02:03:34,948
I'm not sure which key it is.

1761
02:03:37,827 --> 02:03:39,494
Norton!

1762
02:03:44,959 --> 02:03:47,043
Make it easy on yourself, Norton.

1763
02:03:58,347 --> 02:04:01,933
RED: I like to think
the last thing that went through his head,

1764
02:04:02,017 --> 02:04:03,726
other than that bullet,

1765
02:04:03,811 --> 02:04:07,814
was to wonder how the hell
Andy Dufresne ever got the best of him.

1766
02:04:09,483 --> 02:04:10,567
Carter, James...

1767
02:04:10,651 --> 02:04:14,028
RED: Not long after the Warden
deprived us of his company,

1768
02:04:14,113 --> 02:04:16,364
I got a postcard in the mail.

1769
02:04:18,075 --> 02:04:20,493
It was blank but the postmark said...

1770
02:04:20,578 --> 02:04:23,329
Fort Hancock, Texas.

1771
02:04:23,414 --> 02:04:25,457
Fort Hancock.

1772
02:04:25,541 --> 02:04:27,584
Right on the border.

1773
02:04:27,668 --> 02:04:29,711
That's where Andy crossed.

1774
02:04:29,795 --> 02:04:33,673
When I picture him heading south
in his own car with the top down,

1775
02:04:34,717 --> 02:04:36,801
it always makes me laugh.

1776
02:04:38,220 --> 02:04:40,263
Andy Dufresne,

1777
02:04:40,347 --> 02:04:42,724
who crawled through a river of shit

1778
02:04:42,808 --> 02:04:44,893
and came out clean on the other side.

1779
02:04:46,103 --> 02:04:48,146
Andy Dufresne,

1780
02:04:48,230 --> 02:04:50,148
headed for the Pacific.

1781
02:04:52,735 --> 02:04:54,777
Hadley's got him by the toes, right?

1782
02:04:54,862 --> 02:04:59,073
And he says, "I believe this boy's
about to have himself an accident."

1783
02:04:59,158 --> 02:05:02,327
RED: Those of us who knew him best
talk about him often.

1784
02:05:02,411 --> 02:05:04,662
I swear, the stuff he pulled...

1785
02:05:04,747 --> 02:05:07,248
"These friends of mine
could use a couple of beers!"

1786
02:05:07,333 --> 02:05:09,417
- And he got it.
- And he got it!

1787
02:05:10,586 --> 02:05:12,962
RED: Sometimes it makes me sad, though,

1788
02:05:13,047 --> 02:05:15,089
Andy being gone.

1789
02:05:15,174 --> 02:05:19,177
I have to remind myself
that some birds aren't meant to be caged.

1790
02:05:20,262 --> 02:05:22,347
Their feathers are just too bright.

1791
02:05:23,891 --> 02:05:25,934
And when they fly away,

1792
02:05:26,018 --> 02:05:29,938
the part of you that knows
it was a sin to lock them up does rejoice.

1793
02:05:31,690 --> 02:05:33,149
But still...

1794
02:05:33,234 --> 02:05:37,403
the place you live in is that much more drab
and empty that they're gone.

1795
02:05:41,951 --> 02:05:44,202
I guess I just miss my friend.

1796
02:06:08,185 --> 02:06:10,061
Please sit down.

1797
02:06:15,651 --> 02:06:17,777
Ellis Boyd Redding.

1798
02:06:17,861 --> 02:06:21,239
Your files say you've served
40 years of a life sentence.

1799
02:06:21,323 --> 02:06:23,700
Do you feel you've been rehabilitated?

1800
02:06:25,828 --> 02:06:27,912
Rehabilitated?

1801
02:06:29,456 --> 02:06:31,541
Well, now, let me see.

1802
02:06:32,585 --> 02:06:34,919
You know, I don't have any idea
what that means.

1803
02:06:36,714 --> 02:06:39,257
Well, it means you're ready to rejoin society...

1804
02:06:39,341 --> 02:06:41,884
I know what you think it means, sonny.

1805
02:06:44,263 --> 02:06:46,347
To me, it's just a made-up word.

1806
02:06:47,391 --> 02:06:49,642
A politician's word so that...

1807
02:06:49,727 --> 02:06:55,231
young fellas like yourself
can wear a suit and a tie and have a job.

1808
02:06:57,651 --> 02:06:59,736
What do you really want to know?

1809
02:07:00,904 --> 02:07:02,822
Am I sorry for what I did?

1810
02:07:02,906 --> 02:07:04,616
Well, are you?

1811
02:07:06,243 --> 02:07:08,828
There's not a day goes by I don't feel regret.

1812
02:07:10,414 --> 02:07:13,541
Not because I'm in here
or because you think I should.

1813
02:07:17,338 --> 02:07:19,422
I look back on the way I was then.

1814
02:07:22,009 --> 02:07:24,052
A young...

1815
02:07:24,136 --> 02:07:27,221
stupid kid who committed that terrible crime.

1816
02:07:31,060 --> 02:07:33,144
I wanna talk to him.

1817
02:07:34,521 --> 02:07:36,689
I wanna try and talk some sense to him,

1818
02:07:37,733 --> 02:07:39,817
tell him the way things are.

1819
02:07:41,987 --> 02:07:44,072
But I can't.

1820
02:07:45,282 --> 02:07:47,367
That kid's long gone.

1821
02:07:48,661 --> 02:07:50,745
This old man is all that's left.

1822
02:07:52,873 --> 02:07:54,374
I gotta live with that.

1823
02:07:55,709 --> 02:07:57,502
Rehabilitated?

1824
02:07:57,586 --> 02:07:59,587
It's just a bullshit word.

1825
02:07:59,672 --> 02:08:05,593
So you go on and stamp your form, sonny,
and stop wasting my time.

1826
02:08:06,679 --> 02:08:08,721
Because to tell you the truth,

1827
02:08:08,806 --> 02:08:11,307
I don't give a shit.

1828
02:08:49,430 --> 02:08:51,514
(Gate closes)

1829
02:09:10,909 --> 02:09:12,994
(Siren passes outside)

1830
02:09:37,519 --> 02:09:39,604
Here you go, miss.

1831
02:09:41,607 --> 02:09:43,065
Rest room break, boss?

1832
02:09:49,114 --> 02:09:53,409
You don't need to ask me every time you need
to go take a piss. Just go. Understand?

1833
02:09:54,620 --> 02:09:56,287
Yes, sir.

1834
02:10:06,340 --> 02:10:09,383
RED: 40 years
I've been asking permission to piss.

1835
02:10:10,385 --> 02:10:12,595
I can't squeeze a drop without say-so.

1836
02:10:16,725 --> 02:10:18,810
There's a harsh truth to face.

1837
02:10:20,771 --> 02:10:23,105
No way I'm gonna make it on the outside.

1838
02:10:31,323 --> 02:10:34,784
All I do any more
is think of ways to break my parole...

1839
02:10:35,828 --> 02:10:37,912
..so maybe they'd send me back.

1840
02:10:43,418 --> 02:10:45,503
A terrible thing to live in fear.

1841
02:10:46,880 --> 02:10:50,258
Brooks Hatlen knew it, knew it all too well.

1842
02:10:52,427 --> 02:10:55,221
All I want is to be back
where things make sense,

1843
02:10:56,265 --> 02:10:58,766
where I won't have to be afraid all the time.

1844
02:11:01,645 --> 02:11:03,729
Only one thing stops me.

1845
02:11:04,773 --> 02:11:06,858
A promise I made to Andy.

1846
02:11:27,588 --> 02:11:29,672
Here it is.

1847
02:11:39,474 --> 02:11:41,559
Much obliged, sir.

1848
02:15:04,805 --> 02:15:06,889
(Bird calls)

1849
02:15:20,362 --> 02:15:21,654
ANDY: Dear Red,

1850
02:15:21,738 --> 02:15:24,198
if you're reading this, you've gotten out.

1851
02:15:24,282 --> 02:15:28,536
And if you've come this far,
maybe you're willing to come a little further.

1852
02:15:28,620 --> 02:15:31,205
You remember the name of the town, don't you?

1853
02:15:33,500 --> 02:15:35,584
Zihuatanejo.

1854
02:15:36,628 --> 02:15:37,837
I could use a good man

1855
02:15:37,921 --> 02:15:39,964
to help me get my project on wheels.

1856
02:15:40,048 --> 02:15:42,174
I'll keep an eye out for you

1857
02:15:42,259 --> 02:15:44,301
and the chessboard ready.

1858
02:15:45,345 --> 02:15:46,720
Remember, Red,

1859
02:15:46,805 --> 02:15:48,848
hope is a good thing.

1860
02:15:48,932 --> 02:15:50,975
Maybe the best of things.

1861
02:15:51,059 --> 02:15:53,144
And no good thing ever dies.

1862
02:15:54,187 --> 02:15:56,647
I will be hoping that this letter finds you

1863
02:15:56,731 --> 02:15:58,774
and finds you well.

1864
02:15:58,859 --> 02:16:01,360
Your friend, Andy.

1865
02:16:35,937 --> 02:16:39,815
RED: Get busy living or get busy dying.

1866
02:16:42,319 --> 02:16:44,403
That's goddamn right.

1867
02:16:49,910 --> 02:16:52,036
For the second time in my life,

1868
02:16:52,120 --> 02:16:54,205
I'm guilty of committing a crime.

1869
02:16:55,874 --> 02:16:57,958
Parole violation.

1870
02:16:57,959 --> 02:17:01,670
Of course, I doubt they'll toss up
any roadblocks for that.

1871
02:17:02,923 --> 02:17:04,965
Not for an old crook like me.

1872
02:17:05,050 --> 02:17:07,134
Fort Hancock, Texas, please.

1873
02:17:10,847 --> 02:17:14,975
I find I'm so excited I can barely sit still
or hold a thought in my head.

1874
02:17:16,019 --> 02:17:19,021
I think it's the excitement
only a free man can feel.

1875
02:17:19,105 --> 02:17:21,815
A free man at the start of a long journey

1876
02:17:21,900 --> 02:17:24,818
whose conclusion is uncertain.

1877
02:17:27,697 --> 02:17:29,865
I hope I can make it across the border.

1878
02:17:31,743 --> 02:17:34,536
I hope to see my friend and shake his hand.

1879
02:17:36,915 --> 02:17:40,125
I hope the Pacific is as blue
as it has been in my dreams.

1880
02:17:42,879 --> 02:17:44,755
I hope.
