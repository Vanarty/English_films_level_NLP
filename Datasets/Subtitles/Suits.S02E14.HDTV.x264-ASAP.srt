Previously on... <i>Suits</i>

2
00:00:01,167 --> 00:00:03,469
113 female employees

3
00:00:03,537 --> 00:00:05,037
across all 22 divisions.

4
00:00:05,105 --> 00:00:06,572
You know what they have
in common?

5
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,908
All denied promotions due
to the fact that they're women.

6
00:00:08,975 --> 00:00:11,810
How often does Louis
ask you out?

7
00:00:11,878 --> 00:00:14,013
- Every single day.
- There are laws

8
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,981
to protect you from
sexual harassment, you know.

9
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:17,416
- What are you doing here?
- Delivering champagne.

10
00:00:17,484 --> 00:00:19,818
I see you can afford it,
since the money

11
00:00:19,886 --> 00:00:21,420
you've been stealing
from our clients

12
00:00:21,488 --> 00:00:23,255
hasn't been going to
your wife's cancer treatments.

13
00:00:23,323 --> 00:00:24,623
Hey, Monica, how's it going?

14
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:26,358
What the hell are you doing?

15
00:00:26,426 --> 00:00:27,860
Trying to get Monica Eton
to file

16
00:00:27,928 --> 00:00:30,162
a sexual harassment suit
against Daniel Hardman?

17
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:32,665
I know you think you're trying
to help me, but drop it.

18
00:00:32,732 --> 00:00:34,533
- Did Mike pull it off?
- Yep.

19
00:00:34,601 --> 00:00:36,669
- He suspect you were in on it?
- Nope.

20
00:00:36,736 --> 00:00:38,571
Sign
this confidentiality agreement.

21
00:00:38,638 --> 00:00:39,972
I'll waive my claim.

22
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,674
One-time offer,
take it or leave it.

23
00:00:41,741 --> 00:00:43,375
I decided to farm out the case.

24
00:00:43,443 --> 00:00:47,479
Let me guess. Daniel Hardman.

25
00:00:49,516 --> 00:00:51,984
Please state your name
for the record.

26
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:53,485
Sloane Moseley.

27
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:55,688
And what is your position
at Folsom Foods?

28
00:00:55,755 --> 00:00:58,157
This was all established
during my client's first

29
00:00:58,224 --> 00:01:00,259
and second deposition.
I'm sorry.

30
00:01:00,327 --> 00:01:01,627
I'm just getting up to speed.

31
00:01:01,695 --> 00:01:03,162
I like to establish
my own facts.

32
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:05,197
- Or manufacture them.
- Excuse me?

33
00:01:05,265 --> 00:01:08,233
Let's show opposing counsel
some respect.

34
00:01:08,301 --> 00:01:09,735
Both: [Whispering] Douchebag.

35
00:01:09,803 --> 00:01:12,371
Regional Vice President
of Marketing and Research.

36
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:14,540
And how many female executives
work alongside you?

37
00:01:14,608 --> 00:01:15,908
- Three.
- Making a total

38
00:01:15,976 --> 00:01:18,310
of four in a department of nine.
Is there a question?

39
00:01:18,378 --> 00:01:19,678
Yes.

40
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:21,914
What is the ratio
of men to women senior partners

41
00:01:21,982 --> 00:01:23,515
at Pearson Hardman?

42
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:26,051
What? She has no knowledge
of that.

43
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:27,353
Then I direct the question
to you.

44
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,587
And I have the answer,

45
00:01:28,655 --> 00:01:30,089
but it's not relevant
to this case.

46
00:01:30,156 --> 00:01:31,824
What do you mean?
Jessica Pearson's hiring

47
00:01:31,891 --> 00:01:34,126
and firing practices are
directly relevant to the case.

48
00:01:34,194 --> 00:01:36,495
If the next question
isn't regarding Folsom Foods,

49
00:01:36,563 --> 00:01:38,797
this deposition's over.

50
00:01:38,865 --> 00:01:41,533
Folsom Foods?

51
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:43,268
Ah. [Laughs]

52
00:01:43,336 --> 00:01:46,071
So sorry.
As you know, I just took over

53
00:01:46,139 --> 00:01:48,741
45 different cases.
I get confused.

54
00:01:48,808 --> 00:01:50,442
I thought we were deposing
Pearson Hardman today.

55
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:53,345
What the hell
are you talking about?

56
00:01:53,413 --> 00:01:55,381
Oh, my God. Did...

57
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:58,117
did I forget to give you
the subpoena?

58
00:01:58,184 --> 00:02:00,052
Pearson Hardman is being sued
for wrongful termination

59
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,955
in the amount of $10 million.
You have been served.

60
00:02:03,023 --> 00:02:05,457
Wrongful termination?
You're lucky you're not in jail.

61
00:02:05,525 --> 00:02:08,927
It's not on his behalf.
It's on Monica Eton's.

62
00:02:08,995 --> 00:02:10,396
I actually got the idea
from you.

63
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:11,797
Excuse me?

64
00:02:11,865 --> 00:02:15,134
What this firm did to
that woman was unconscionable.

65
00:02:15,201 --> 00:02:17,336
You piece of shit.

66
00:02:17,404 --> 00:02:19,571
Monica Eton deserved
to get fired.

67
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:21,273
Huh.
The eight women I'm gonna stack

68
00:02:21,341 --> 00:02:23,175
the jury with might disagree
with that.

69
00:02:23,243 --> 00:02:24,810
Not once they learn
she was sleeping with you

70
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:26,378
while you were embezzling
from this firm.

71
00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:28,614
And how, exactly,
are they going to learn that?

72
00:02:28,682 --> 00:02:31,016
One of the three people
in this room is gonna tell them.

73
00:02:31,084 --> 00:02:32,418
I'm guessing it won't be you.

74
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:34,286
I'm afraid it won't be
one of you either.

75
00:02:34,354 --> 00:02:35,587
You gonna kill us?

76
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:37,489
Oh, I won't need to.

77
00:02:37,557 --> 00:02:39,317
You're bound
by the confidentiality agreement

78
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:42,361
Jessica signed
the night I left.

79
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,498
"All knowledge of any activity
of Daniel Hardman..."

80
00:02:46,566 --> 00:02:47,733
I know what it goddamn says.

81
00:02:47,801 --> 00:02:49,702
You signed it so quickly,
I wasn't sure.

82
00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:51,170
Fine.

83
00:02:51,237 --> 00:02:52,738
I know a shakedown
when I see one.

84
00:02:52,806 --> 00:02:54,640
What do you want?
It's not what I want.

85
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:55,774
It's what Monica wants.

86
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:57,376
And what is that?

87
00:02:57,444 --> 00:02:59,611
Payback.
You see, when Mike Ross

88
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:02,781
brought that trumped-up suit
to her, she was very upset.

89
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:04,809
It brought back the memory
of what you did to her.

90
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:06,118
I didn't do shit to her.

91
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:07,586
That wasn't how she saw it.

92
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:08,987
Yet you didn't lift a finger
to help her.

93
00:03:09,055 --> 00:03:10,923
I wanted to at the time.

94
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:13,092
But I couldn't very well attack
my own firm, now could I?

95
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:15,360
- Never stopped you before.
- Touche.

96
00:03:15,428 --> 00:03:16,762
But you can't mention
that either.

97
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:17,930
We're done.

98
00:03:17,997 --> 00:03:19,198
Harvey, will you escort

99
00:03:19,265 --> 00:03:20,733
this piece of filth
out of the building,

100
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,136
make sure he doesn't commit
any crimes on the way out?

101
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,280
Oh, by the way, Mike Ross,

102
00:03:35,348 --> 00:03:37,916
virtuoso job drafting
that complaint.

103
00:03:37,984 --> 00:03:39,284
All I had to do was search

104
00:03:39,352 --> 00:03:41,820
and replace "Daniel Hardman"
with "anonymous."

105
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:43,956
Almost as virtuoso
as the job he did

106
00:03:44,023 --> 00:03:48,894
convincing you Lawrence Kemp
signed that affidavit.

107
00:03:48,962 --> 00:03:50,963
Must stick in your craw...

108
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:53,065
Having to walk by my name
day after day.

109
00:03:53,133 --> 00:03:54,500
Oh, we'll get to it.

110
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:55,834
First we had to turn
your old office

111
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:57,336
into the new conference room.

112
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:59,204
When Jessica and I
engineered our coup,

113
00:03:59,272 --> 00:04:00,906
she had that sign down
within minutes.

114
00:04:00,974 --> 00:04:02,841
Schmidt, Gordon, van Dyke.

115
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:05,043
Jessica wanted it down
the second you were gone.

116
00:04:05,111 --> 00:04:07,646
I told her it was too soon.

117
00:04:07,714 --> 00:04:09,381
No.

118
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:12,251
You asked her to be name
partner, and she said "no."

119
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:14,086
And do you know why?

120
00:04:14,154 --> 00:04:18,023
Because deep in her heart,
she doesn't trust you.

121
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:20,225
She trusted me
to kick your ass.

122
00:04:20,293 --> 00:04:22,060
Twice.

123
00:04:22,128 --> 00:04:24,863
[Elevator dings] Maybe.

124
00:04:27,167 --> 00:04:28,901
But I saw that look back there.

125
00:04:28,968 --> 00:04:32,137
She didn't tell you about
the confidentiality agreement,

126
00:04:32,205 --> 00:04:34,039
did she?

127
00:04:37,911 --> 00:04:39,478

138
00:05:12,922 --> 00:05:15,190
I don't want to discuss this,
Harvey.

139
00:05:15,257 --> 00:05:17,192
He gave up his partnership,
his money,

140
00:05:17,259 --> 00:05:19,127
and his voting rights.
It was a good deal.

141
00:05:19,195 --> 00:05:20,428
I did it, and it's done.

142
00:05:20,496 --> 00:05:22,297
And now it's come back
to bite us in the ass.

143
00:05:22,364 --> 00:05:23,364
We have to settle.

144
00:05:23,432 --> 00:05:25,133
I am not settling.

145
00:05:25,201 --> 00:05:26,935
Our backs are against the wall,

146
00:05:27,002 --> 00:05:28,937
and we're gonna drain
our resources on a case

147
00:05:29,004 --> 00:05:31,239
that we can't win
just because you boxed us in?

148
00:05:31,307 --> 00:05:33,141
It was
a take-it-or-leave-it offer.

149
00:05:33,209 --> 00:05:34,909
I had one minute.

150
00:05:34,977 --> 00:05:37,111
I wanted to be done
with the man, so I took it.

151
00:05:37,179 --> 00:05:39,314
You told me
never to make rash decisions,

152
00:05:39,381 --> 00:05:40,582
and then you do this.

153
00:05:40,649 --> 00:05:42,884
I told you,
I didn't have a choice.

154
00:05:42,952 --> 00:05:45,320
Did you have a choice when
you decided to keep it from me?

155
00:05:45,387 --> 00:05:47,288
I didn't think
it would ever come up again.

156
00:05:47,356 --> 00:05:49,891
That is not
a good enough reason.

157
00:05:53,329 --> 00:05:58,166
What did he tell you?

158
00:05:58,234 --> 00:06:01,502
He told me you'd never put
my name on the door.

159
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:03,805
He told me
you'd come after me someday,

160
00:06:03,873 --> 00:06:07,709
maybe even threaten my family
the same way you threatened his.

161
00:06:07,776 --> 00:06:09,611
A little something you never
bothered to consult me on.

162
00:06:09,678 --> 00:06:10,845
I didn't have to.

163
00:06:10,913 --> 00:06:12,553
You'd have told me
to do whatever it took.

164
00:06:12,615 --> 00:06:14,382
- That's not the point.
- Well, what's the point?

165
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:16,317
You kept it from me.

166
00:06:16,385 --> 00:06:18,152
I let it go

167
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:19,954
because I knew he was just
trying to get into my head,

168
00:06:20,022 --> 00:06:23,858
the same way he's trying
to get into your head now.

169
00:06:23,926 --> 00:06:25,360
What's gonna happen
when he deposes you,

170
00:06:25,427 --> 00:06:26,895
and you can't tell
the full story?

171
00:06:26,962 --> 00:06:28,229
I don't know, Harvey.

172
00:06:28,297 --> 00:06:30,198
But I trusted you
to beat him before,

173
00:06:30,266 --> 00:06:34,535
and I'm trusting you
to beat him again now.

174
00:06:36,538 --> 00:06:37,639
[Sighs]

175
00:06:37,706 --> 00:06:39,340
Hey, uh, do you have a minute?

176
00:06:39,408 --> 00:06:40,608
That's about all I have.
I'm under pressure.

177
00:06:40,676 --> 00:06:42,410
I've got to get this done.
Yeah, I know.

178
00:06:42,478 --> 00:06:45,113
We're all swamped with this
Folsom Foods thing, but, uh,

179
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:49,751
I need your help with a case
that's a little more... personal.

180
00:06:49,818 --> 00:06:51,085
I am swamped with Folsom Foods,

181
00:06:51,153 --> 00:06:52,487
but I came in early
to carve out

182
00:06:52,554 --> 00:06:54,589
an hour to work on something
personal of my own.

183
00:06:54,657 --> 00:06:58,893
Hmm, what is it?

184
00:06:58,961 --> 00:07:01,696
Harvard application.

185
00:07:01,764 --> 00:07:04,065
Rachel, that's great.
It's great if I get in,

186
00:07:04,133 --> 00:07:05,733
and I'm not gonna get in
if I don't get this done,

187
00:07:05,801 --> 00:07:07,769
and I'm not gonna get it done
if people keep bothering me.

188
00:07:07,836 --> 00:07:08,957
Do people keep bothering you?

189
00:07:08,971 --> 00:07:10,171
No.

190
00:07:10,239 --> 00:07:13,474
Okay.
So this is going well then.

191
00:07:13,542 --> 00:07:15,510
Less than
1 out of every 12 people

192
00:07:15,577 --> 00:07:16,711
who applies gets in.

193
00:07:16,779 --> 00:07:18,179
What if I'm not
one of those people?

194
00:07:18,213 --> 00:07:21,950
I don't know, maybe you'll
get in somewhere else.

195
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:24,953
You're kidding me.

196
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:26,788
I don't want to have
a fallback.

197
00:07:26,855 --> 00:07:30,291
You mean backup?
A logical plan "B"?

198
00:07:30,359 --> 00:07:32,226
Mike, I've been
half-in, half-out

199
00:07:32,294 --> 00:07:34,762
of committing to this for years.
I'm done with that.

200
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:36,698
Going to law school
is committing.

201
00:07:36,765 --> 00:07:38,045
I don't want to go
to law school.

202
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,400
I want to go to Harvard.

203
00:07:39,468 --> 00:07:40,802
Just because your father
went there doesn't mean

204
00:07:40,869 --> 00:07:42,003
you need to go there too.

205
00:07:42,071 --> 00:07:45,873
That's not why.

206
00:07:45,941 --> 00:07:48,076
[Sighs] You want to work
at Pearson Hardman.

207
00:07:48,143 --> 00:07:51,112
And if I don't go there,
then I can't work here.

208
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:53,448
You need any help?

209
00:07:53,515 --> 00:07:57,919
No, it's okay.
I'm gonna do this on my own.

210
00:07:57,987 --> 00:08:01,189
- Okay. [Clears throat]
- I'm so sorr...

211
00:08:01,256 --> 00:08:02,657
what did you need help with?

212
00:08:02,725 --> 00:08:06,227
It's okay.
I'm gonna do it on my own.

213
00:08:06,295 --> 00:08:08,329
Donna, I need your help.

214
00:08:08,397 --> 00:08:11,032
With what?

215
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:12,600
Hardman.
I want you to convince Harvey

216
00:08:12,668 --> 00:08:14,068
to let me
on the Monica Eton case.

217
00:08:14,136 --> 00:08:15,269
I'm sorry, Louis.
I can't do that.

218
00:08:15,337 --> 00:08:16,738
Donna, come on.

219
00:08:16,805 --> 00:08:19,140
He made me look like a fool.
He did the same thing to me!

220
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:20,408
Well, I need revenge.

221
00:08:20,476 --> 00:08:21,743
[Exhales sharply] So do I.

222
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:23,144
See, then why won't you
ask Harvey for me?

223
00:08:23,212 --> 00:08:25,947
Because Harvey needs
to handle this himself.

224
00:08:28,517 --> 00:08:30,752
So this has nothing to do with
any residual issues you've had

225
00:08:30,819 --> 00:08:32,186
with me and my past behavior?

226
00:08:32,254 --> 00:08:35,056
No.

227
00:08:35,124 --> 00:08:38,192
Because I never told him.

228
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:40,361
I never told Harvey
how sorry I was

229
00:08:40,429 --> 00:08:42,296
for trusting someone
that betrayed us all.

230
00:08:42,364 --> 00:08:44,432
- Louis, he knows.
- I mean, that bastard

231
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,367
wouldn't even be here right now
if it wasn't for me.

232
00:08:46,435 --> 00:08:48,002
He'd just be some partner
skulking around,

233
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:49,504
never having won
if I hadn't voted for him.

234
00:08:49,571 --> 00:08:51,205
Look, it's gonna be okay.

235
00:08:51,273 --> 00:08:53,241
Success is the best revenge.

236
00:08:53,308 --> 00:08:56,644
Bullshit.

237
00:08:56,712 --> 00:09:00,148
Revenge is the best revenge.

238
00:09:03,052 --> 00:09:05,119
- Harvey, where are you going?
It's only 10:30.

239
00:09:05,187 --> 00:09:07,155
- You gonna dock my pay?
- I'm serious.

240
00:09:07,222 --> 00:09:08,556
I've got
some really good stuff here.

241
00:09:08,624 --> 00:09:10,825
First of all, Hardman's
non-compete is still in effect.

242
00:09:10,893 --> 00:09:13,461
He can't even be practicing law.
In New York.

243
00:09:13,529 --> 00:09:15,263
Where the hell
do you think we are?

244
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:17,965
He's working out of Jersey.
He's got an office of one.

245
00:09:18,033 --> 00:09:19,801
Bank account, car service,
cell phone.

246
00:09:19,868 --> 00:09:21,035
I mean, all of them
are based in New York.

247
00:09:21,103 --> 00:09:22,236
We can fight it.

248
00:09:22,304 --> 00:09:25,373
- That's exactly what he wants.
- What?

249
00:09:25,441 --> 00:09:28,042
Articles of incorporation,
office, landline,

250
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:29,977
company car, all in Jersey.

251
00:09:30,045 --> 00:09:32,513
He's constructed it,
so we'd be tempted to fight him,

252
00:09:32,581 --> 00:09:34,142
waste our time and resources,
then lose.

253
00:09:34,149 --> 00:09:35,249
Okay, fine.
Then what we need to do next

254
00:09:35,317 --> 00:09:36,317
is dig into Monica Eton.
I think...

255
00:09:36,385 --> 00:09:37,585
Hold on.

256
00:09:37,653 --> 00:09:39,454
You're on Folsom Foods,
not Monica Eton.

257
00:09:39,521 --> 00:09:41,489
Harvey, they're using
the exact lawsuit I wrote,

258
00:09:41,557 --> 00:09:43,391
word for word.
I know how to fight it.

259
00:09:43,459 --> 00:09:44,792
Did he tell you that?

260
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:47,028
No, he didn't need to.
I read it.

261
00:09:47,096 --> 00:09:48,496
I mean, he didn't just get
the idea from me,

262
00:09:48,564 --> 00:09:50,031
he got the whole execution
from me.

263
00:09:50,099 --> 00:09:53,334
He's doing that because
he's trying to get in your head.

264
00:09:53,402 --> 00:09:55,603
This isn't your fault.
We did this together.

265
00:09:55,671 --> 00:09:57,038
Then let me help you fix it.

266
00:09:57,106 --> 00:09:58,739
I'm sorry.
Those papers can't help me,

267
00:09:58,807 --> 00:10:00,441
and neither can you.
[Car engine starts]

268
00:10:00,509 --> 00:10:04,378
Har...

269

[doorbell rings]

270
00:10:09,218 --> 00:10:10,518
- Oh.
- Rachel.

271
00:10:10,586 --> 00:10:11,552
Yes, yes. I know who you are.

272
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:13,121
I just wasn't expecting you.

273
00:10:13,188 --> 00:10:15,823
Um, I don't live here.

274
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,460
You must be here to see my dad.
Yes, I am.

275
00:10:19,528 --> 00:10:20,862
Please, come in.

276
00:10:20,929 --> 00:10:22,569
He's just in the back.
He TiVo'd the game.

277
00:10:22,631 --> 00:10:25,733
- Jets?
- Giants.

278
00:10:25,801 --> 00:10:29,070
Man after my own heart.
[Sports announcer in background]

279
00:10:29,138 --> 00:10:31,439
Why is it the defensive line
is always packed with a bunch

280
00:10:31,507 --> 00:10:34,108
of big, strong, black guys
and the offensive line

281
00:10:34,176 --> 00:10:36,611
packed
with big, fat, white guys?

282
00:10:36,678 --> 00:10:38,479
Well, I don't know.
But looking at you,

283
00:10:38,547 --> 00:10:41,582
you've got a foot
in both camps.

284
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:43,251
I guess you're not here
to ask a favor.

285
00:10:43,318 --> 00:10:45,286
No. I'm here to do you a favor.

286
00:10:45,354 --> 00:10:46,521
[Pauses game]

287
00:10:46,588 --> 00:10:47,488
Get rid of him
while you still can.

288
00:10:47,556 --> 00:10:48,923
Jessica...

289
00:10:48,991 --> 00:10:50,358
You do not know who you are
in bed with, Robert.

290
00:10:50,425 --> 00:10:52,660
I went to law school
with the man.

291
00:10:52,728 --> 00:10:54,061
Well, he might have been
a prince back then,

292
00:10:54,129 --> 00:10:55,363
but he sure as hell
isn't one now.

293
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:56,998
Then enlighten me.

294
00:10:57,065 --> 00:10:58,599
Because from what I know,

295
00:10:58,667 --> 00:11:00,668
he left the firm
to take care of his wife,

296
00:11:00,736 --> 00:11:02,403
and when he came back,
you forced him out.

297
00:11:02,471 --> 00:11:05,239
[Chuckles] That's nowhere
near the full story.

298
00:11:05,307 --> 00:11:09,877
What else is there?
I'm listening.

299
00:11:09,945 --> 00:11:11,646
You signed
a confidentiality agreement.

300
00:11:11,713 --> 00:11:14,916
I am precluded from speaking
on that topic.

301
00:11:14,983 --> 00:11:16,450
Then I'm afraid
you're precluded

302
00:11:16,518 --> 00:11:17,952
from convincing me
to take him off this case.

303
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:19,460
- Robert...
- What's it gonna cost you

304
00:11:19,521 --> 00:11:21,255
to violate the agreement?

305
00:11:21,323 --> 00:11:23,958
Give me a number. Hmm?

306
00:11:24,026 --> 00:11:26,327
I'll assume
it's in the millions.

307
00:11:26,395 --> 00:11:30,231
15.

308
00:11:30,299 --> 00:11:33,167
You said I didn't know the
kind of man I was in bed with?

309
00:11:33,235 --> 00:11:35,937
From the looks of it,
I'm in bed with the kind of man

310
00:11:36,004 --> 00:11:40,708
who's got you by the balls.

311
00:11:40,776 --> 00:11:42,643
Don't say I didn't warn you.

All right, Harvey.

It's the middle of the night,
you wanted in.

317
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:56,490
What can I do for you?

318
00:11:56,558 --> 00:11:59,093
I need to talk hypothetically.

319
00:11:59,161 --> 00:12:01,395
Is this hypothetically
about a suit being brought

320
00:12:01,463 --> 00:12:03,497
by an ex-name partner
against his old firm?

321
00:12:03,565 --> 00:12:05,766
Because, you know I can't talk about
a case that's on my own docket.

322
00:12:05,834 --> 00:12:07,034
Would you prefer I tell the IRS

323
00:12:07,069 --> 00:12:09,337
about a hypothetical
conversation I had

324
00:12:09,404 --> 00:12:11,672
with an up-and-coming judge
nine years ago?

325
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:15,042
[Sighs] Give it to me.

326
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:17,144
The name partner in question
was the one she had

327
00:12:17,212 --> 00:12:19,914
an affair with while he was
embezzling money from the firm.

328
00:12:19,982 --> 00:12:21,515
So bring it up. Make your case.

329
00:12:21,583 --> 00:12:23,217
We can't.

330
00:12:23,285 --> 00:12:25,152
He got you to sign
a confidentiality agreement.

331
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:26,520
Yes.

332
00:12:26,588 --> 00:12:28,723
But the spirit of the agreement
was to shield him.

333
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:30,324
If we had a sealed hearing,

334
00:12:30,392 --> 00:12:33,194
how would you rule
on tossing the confidentiality?

335
00:12:33,262 --> 00:12:35,596
- I'm afraid you'd lose.
- Why?

336
00:12:35,664 --> 00:12:36,697
If he were the plaintiff,
it'd be one thing,

337
00:12:36,765 --> 00:12:38,165
but he's the attorney.

338
00:12:38,233 --> 00:12:39,967
I can't punish the woman
for her choice of attorney.

339
00:12:40,035 --> 00:12:43,037
What if he doesn't make
that argument?

340
00:12:43,105 --> 00:12:44,505
He will.

341
00:12:44,573 --> 00:12:46,774
He came to see you too.

00:13:05,374 --> 00:13:06,674
I'm here for my...

347
00:13:06,742 --> 00:13:08,977
Oh, I know
what you're here for.

348
00:13:09,044 --> 00:13:11,312
Jessica's deposition.
3:00 on the nose.

349
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:12,981
I'm nothing if not prompt.

350
00:13:13,048 --> 00:13:16,151
You're nothing
if not an asshole.

351
00:13:16,218 --> 00:13:17,385
Is that why you're sitting
out here?

352
00:13:17,453 --> 00:13:18,553
To call me that?

353
00:13:18,621 --> 00:13:20,355
No. I just wanted to personally

354
00:13:20,423 --> 00:13:21,856
escort you
to the conference room.

355
00:13:21,924 --> 00:13:24,359
Mm. Lucky me.

356
00:13:24,427 --> 00:13:27,228
We'll see about that.

357
00:13:32,768 --> 00:13:33,902
My old office.

358
00:13:33,969 --> 00:13:36,337
Harvey wasn't kidding. My idea.

359
00:13:36,405 --> 00:13:39,007
It took a while
to feng shui the evil out.

360
00:13:39,074 --> 00:13:42,811
Look, Donna, I understand...

361
00:13:42,878 --> 00:13:45,480
You piece of shit.

362
00:13:45,548 --> 00:13:46,714
Is that all you've got?

363
00:13:46,782 --> 00:13:49,350
Oh, I will go right now.

364
00:13:49,418 --> 00:13:51,186
Are you gonna sue me?

365
00:13:51,253 --> 00:13:54,222
Because I don't think anybody
here is gonna testify.

366
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:55,757
I never meant to hurt you.

367
00:13:55,825 --> 00:13:57,725
You mean when you planted
that memo and got me fired?

368
00:13:57,793 --> 00:14:00,395
I did no such thing.

369
00:14:00,463 --> 00:14:01,830
And any implication otherwise

370
00:14:01,897 --> 00:14:03,631
from within this firm
is actionable.

371
00:14:03,699 --> 00:14:06,167
Yeah, right.
But you never meant to hurt me.

372
00:14:06,235 --> 00:14:08,870
I'd imagine
whoever planted that memo

373
00:14:08,938 --> 00:14:10,672
thought that
you would bring it forward.

374
00:14:10,739 --> 00:14:12,540
And if you had, the only thing
that would have happened

375
00:14:12,608 --> 00:14:14,242
to you is
you would have been scolded.

376
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:17,645
And Harvey's career
would have been over.

377
00:14:17,713 --> 00:14:21,149
So it really is like that
between the two of you.

378
00:14:27,456 --> 00:14:30,291
You can go now.

379
00:14:30,359 --> 00:14:35,129
Jessica's deposition is
in the other conference room.

380
00:14:39,235 --> 00:14:41,169
[Exhales]

381
00:14:41,237 --> 00:14:43,171
Please state your full name
for the record.

382
00:14:43,239 --> 00:14:46,407
Jessica Lourdes Pearson.

383
00:14:46,475 --> 00:14:48,710
Monica Eton's reviews
from '03 to '07,

384
00:14:48,777 --> 00:14:51,112
all excellent, agreed?

385
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:52,313
Yes.

386
00:14:52,381 --> 00:14:54,616
Then why was she let go?

387
00:14:54,683 --> 00:14:57,051
That was determined
by a variety of factors.

388
00:14:57,119 --> 00:14:58,386
Was one of the factors
that she was having

389
00:14:58,454 --> 00:14:59,954
an affair with a partner?

390
00:15:00,022 --> 00:15:01,589
I'm so glad
you brought that up,

391
00:15:01,657 --> 00:15:02,724
you little son of a bitch,
because...

392
00:15:02,791 --> 00:15:03,791
Off the record.

393
00:15:03,859 --> 00:15:06,761
Hmm, so soon.

394
00:15:06,829 --> 00:15:08,563
[Whispering]
I told you this would happen.

395
00:15:08,631 --> 00:15:10,832
He's baiting you
into breaching confidentiality.

396
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:13,034
And I'm ready to bite down
and drag him in with me.

397
00:15:13,102 --> 00:15:16,137
Don't. We can't afford it.

398
00:15:19,008 --> 00:15:20,675
No.

399
00:15:20,743 --> 00:15:22,677
The affair itself
was not a factor.

400
00:15:22,745 --> 00:15:25,780
With whom was she having
this affair?

401
00:15:25,848 --> 00:15:27,615
- I refuse to answer that.
- Why?

402
00:15:27,683 --> 00:15:31,319
Were you in love with him?

403
00:15:31,387 --> 00:15:32,820
In love with him?

404
00:15:32,888 --> 00:15:34,589
I thought
she was bottom-feeding.

405
00:15:34,657 --> 00:15:36,491
I might have actually vomited

406
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:38,092
when I heard.
Okay, that's enough.

407
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,028
We're not answering
this line of questioning.

408
00:15:40,095 --> 00:15:41,629
Move on.

409
00:15:41,697 --> 00:15:43,264
You said my client's dismissal

410
00:15:43,332 --> 00:15:45,466
was due
to a variety of factors.

411
00:15:45,534 --> 00:15:46,601
And then you said
it wasn't the affair,

412
00:15:46,669 --> 00:15:47,829
and it wasn't job performance.

413
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:50,939
So I ask you, what was it?

414
00:15:51,006 --> 00:15:52,106
Is it a personal dislike?

415
00:15:52,174 --> 00:15:54,742
Are you jealous of her?

416
00:15:54,810 --> 00:15:57,879
Or do you just hate other women?
Tread lightly, Daniel.

417
00:15:57,947 --> 00:16:00,715
Let's try some questions
your client can answer.

418
00:16:00,783 --> 00:16:02,263
Were you in a relationship
at the time

419
00:16:02,318 --> 00:16:04,385
of my client's dismissal?
Excuse me?

420
00:16:04,453 --> 00:16:06,688
Jessica Pearson's personal
life is not an issue here.

421
00:16:06,755 --> 00:16:08,156
Well, I beg to differ.

422
00:16:08,223 --> 00:16:09,891
And since your client can't seem
to find her words today,

423
00:16:09,959 --> 00:16:11,492
I, for one, can testify that

424
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:14,896
she was not in a relationship
at the time.

425
00:16:14,964 --> 00:16:16,731
She's always been married
to her job.

426
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:18,266
And she wants
her female associates

427
00:16:18,334 --> 00:16:19,767
to be equally committed,

428
00:16:19,835 --> 00:16:22,155
so that as soon as they have
anything else in their lives...

429
00:16:22,204 --> 00:16:25,340
in other words, sex...
she cuts 'em loose.

430
00:16:27,509 --> 00:16:29,277
This is bullshit.

431
00:16:29,345 --> 00:16:31,579
- Then tell me differently.
- We're done here.

432
00:16:31,647 --> 00:16:32,947
The truth is,

433
00:16:33,015 --> 00:16:35,216
Monica was younger than you,
prettier than you,

434
00:16:35,284 --> 00:16:38,286
sexually active,
and of child-bearing age...

435
00:16:38,354 --> 00:16:44,025
all of the things you are not,
and you fired her for it.

436
00:16:55,838 --> 00:16:56,838
We gonna talk
about what happened?

437
00:16:56,905 --> 00:16:58,539
- Not tonight.
- Jessica...

438
00:16:58,607 --> 00:17:00,742
Son of a bitch all
but called me bitter and barren.

439
00:17:00,809 --> 00:17:03,244
He did call you that,
but it's only gonna get worse.

440
00:17:03,312 --> 00:17:04,879
And you should have jumped
to my defense

441
00:17:04,947 --> 00:17:06,114
sooner than you did.

442
00:17:06,181 --> 00:17:08,016
I'm your lawyer,
not your husband.

443
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:10,385
And if I didn't jump in
when I did, we'd be broke.

444
00:17:10,452 --> 00:17:12,186
Look, I told you before,
we need to settle.

445
00:17:12,254 --> 00:17:14,622
And I told you before,
we're not settling.

446
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:15,957
Don't you see what he's doing?

447
00:17:16,025 --> 00:17:17,425
He's trying to make this case
about gender.

448
00:17:17,493 --> 00:17:19,127
- It's not!
- It doesn't matter.

449
00:17:19,194 --> 00:17:21,129
Look, you can't be
the name defendant

450
00:17:21,196 --> 00:17:23,097
on a gender discrimination case

451
00:17:23,165 --> 00:17:25,600
while we're suing Folsom Foods
for the same thing.

452
00:17:25,668 --> 00:17:28,403
I am not capitulating
to that man.

453
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:29,831
Then you're gonna look
like a fool.

454
00:17:29,872 --> 00:17:31,272
That's enough. [Elevator dings]

455
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:33,374
You're not calling the shots,
I am.

456
00:17:33,442 --> 00:17:35,677
And whether you think
my call is wrong or not,

457
00:17:35,744 --> 00:17:40,148
it is still my name
on that goddamn wall.

458
00:17:40,215 --> 00:17:42,083
You.

459
00:17:53,696 --> 00:17:55,763
Hey, um, sorry,
I don't want to bother you

460
00:17:55,831 --> 00:17:57,198
if you're still working
on your application,

461
00:17:57,266 --> 00:17:59,634
but I need a favor.

462
00:17:59,702 --> 00:18:02,670
Uh, no, I finished.
What do you need?

463
00:18:02,738 --> 00:18:06,240
I need to see a transcript
of Jessica's deposition.

464
00:18:06,308 --> 00:18:08,309
- That's confidential.
- That's why I need your help.

465
00:18:08,377 --> 00:18:10,011
- Mike...
- Rachel, please?

466
00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:13,915
I need it.

467
00:18:17,586 --> 00:18:20,488
By the way, congratulations
on finishing your application.

468
00:18:20,556 --> 00:18:22,824
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

469
00:18:22,891 --> 00:18:24,692
Are you looking for anything
in particular?

470
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:29,030
- No, not exactly.
- Uh-oh.

471
00:18:29,098 --> 00:18:32,900
- Oh, my God.
- It just keeps going.

472
00:18:32,968 --> 00:18:35,870
It's worse and worse.

473
00:18:35,938 --> 00:18:37,405
She had to sit through this.

474
00:18:37,473 --> 00:18:39,173
Oh, God. This is all my fault.

475
00:18:39,241 --> 00:18:41,943
- Wait, Mike...
- No, I-I used you to get

476
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:43,210
to Monica, and then I used her,

477
00:18:43,245 --> 00:18:45,079
and now he's taking it out
on Jessica.

478
00:18:45,147 --> 00:18:46,681
Yeah, you couldn't have known
it was gonna lead to this.

479
00:18:46,749 --> 00:18:49,450
- [Sighs]
- It's okay.

480
00:18:49,518 --> 00:18:53,488
No, it isn't.
I need to use this.

481
00:18:53,555 --> 00:18:55,223
Either you print it
or I type it out from memory,

482
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:58,893
but I have to. Why?

483
00:18:58,961 --> 00:19:00,228
You said you wanted
to go to Harvard

484
00:19:00,295 --> 00:19:01,896
so that you could work
at Pearson Hardman, right?

485
00:19:01,964 --> 00:19:03,264
Yeah.

486
00:19:03,332 --> 00:19:05,666
Well, if I don't fix this,

487
00:19:05,734 --> 00:19:07,468
there might not be
a Pearson Hardman.

488
00:19:18,575 --> 00:19:20,376
You can't talk to me.

489
00:19:20,444 --> 00:19:21,611
Actually, I can.

490
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:23,079
I don't have any equity
in the firm,

491
00:19:23,113 --> 00:19:24,647
and I'm not working
on this case.

492
00:19:24,715 --> 00:19:25,815
You're an interested party,

493
00:19:25,883 --> 00:19:27,417
and you drafted
the original complaint.

494
00:19:27,484 --> 00:19:28,985
Any judge in the world
sides with me.

495
00:19:29,053 --> 00:19:30,720
Listen, Monica. Monica!

496
00:19:30,788 --> 00:19:31,955
I'm not trying to set you up.

497
00:19:32,022 --> 00:19:33,156
I'm trying to take
responsibility here.

498
00:19:33,223 --> 00:19:34,524
For what?

499
00:19:34,591 --> 00:19:36,359
For doing exactly
what you just said I did.

500
00:19:36,427 --> 00:19:37,894
For drafting
the original complaint,

501
00:19:37,962 --> 00:19:41,397
starting this whole thing off.
I'm... I'm sorry.

502
00:19:41,465 --> 00:19:43,333
No, no.
The only thing you're sorry

503
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,301
about is your little maneuver
backfired.

504
00:19:45,369 --> 00:19:46,730
Yeah, but it didn't backfire
on me.

505
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:48,738
It backfired on Jessica.
That's too bad.

506
00:19:48,806 --> 00:19:51,240
That's exactly
what I'm happy about.

507
00:19:51,308 --> 00:19:52,308
What? Jessica didn't screw you,

508
00:19:52,376 --> 00:19:54,143
Hardman did.

509
00:19:54,211 --> 00:19:56,746
Daniel Hardman didn't show up
in my office to fire me,

510
00:19:56,814 --> 00:19:59,349
without cause, notice,
or a letter of recommendation.

511
00:19:59,416 --> 00:20:01,184
- She had cause.
- Did she?

512
00:20:01,251 --> 00:20:03,219
When I told her I knew nothing
about Daniel's embezzlement,

513
00:20:03,287 --> 00:20:06,322
do you know what she said?
"I don't care."

514
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:07,991
And then five years later,
she sends you

515
00:20:08,058 --> 00:20:10,059
to turn me against him.
That's just it, she didn't.

516
00:20:10,127 --> 00:20:11,227
Look at that.

517
00:20:11,295 --> 00:20:13,062
The attack dog defends
its owner.

518
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:14,764
Blame me,
you can even blame Harvey,

519
00:20:14,832 --> 00:20:16,899
but Jessica had nothing
to do with it.

520
00:20:16,967 --> 00:20:18,768
If you think I'm gonna buy
for one second

521
00:20:18,836 --> 00:20:20,570
she wasn't behind you coming
to me with that lawsuit,

522
00:20:20,637 --> 00:20:22,438
you are even more naive
than I was.

523
00:20:22,506 --> 00:20:25,041
Please just look
at what he did to her.

524
00:20:25,109 --> 00:20:27,844
I don't have to
because I don't care.

525
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,594
Monica.

526
00:20:44,661 --> 00:20:47,196
- Louis.
- How are you?

527
00:20:47,264 --> 00:20:48,698
- I'm fine.
- Good.

528
00:20:48,766 --> 00:20:50,733
You know,
I wanted to tell you...

529
00:20:50,801 --> 00:20:52,702
I can't really talk right now,
Louis.

530
00:20:52,770 --> 00:20:54,437
Right, because you've got
the deposition?

531
00:20:54,505 --> 00:20:58,374
- I'm meeting Daniel.
- Daniel.

532
00:20:58,442 --> 00:20:59,675
Okay, well, it was really...

533
00:20:59,743 --> 00:21:01,611
it was really nice seeing you.

534
00:21:01,678 --> 00:21:04,514
You too.

535
00:21:15,592 --> 00:21:17,960
- A little busy at the moment.
- Monica Eton, I know.

536
00:21:18,028 --> 00:21:19,308
Look,
Harvey didn't want my help,

537
00:21:19,329 --> 00:21:20,463
but I thought
that maybe you would.

538
00:21:20,531 --> 00:21:21,631
Harvey is right.

539
00:21:21,698 --> 00:21:23,399
I need you
on top of Folsom Foods.

540
00:21:23,467 --> 00:21:25,668
This is about Folsom Foods.

541
00:21:25,736 --> 00:21:27,203
What do you have?

542
00:21:27,271 --> 00:21:30,440
If you can get Monica to admit
that her affair was with Daniel,

543
00:21:30,507 --> 00:21:32,708
this isn't
about gender anymore.

544
00:21:32,776 --> 00:21:33,810
Because they
were both dismissed.

545
00:21:33,877 --> 00:21:35,244
A man and a woman.

546
00:21:35,312 --> 00:21:37,413
Puts you back in the driver's
seat on Folsom Foods.

547
00:21:37,481 --> 00:21:39,148
Okay, do you have
a line of questioning?

548
00:21:39,216 --> 00:21:42,051
Right here.

549
00:21:43,654 --> 00:21:45,555
You ready?

550
00:21:45,622 --> 00:21:46,823
He is.

551
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:48,324
I want you to let him
take the lead on this.

552
00:21:48,392 --> 00:21:50,593
- What?
- Not a discussion.

553
00:21:50,661 --> 00:21:51,794
Where are you going?

554
00:21:51,862 --> 00:21:53,596
Oh, I'm not spending
another moment

555
00:21:53,664 --> 00:21:55,994
in the same room
with those people.

556
00:22:01,805 --> 00:22:03,439
Miss Eton... Him?

557
00:22:03,507 --> 00:22:04,907
You're bringing in
the "B" team?

558
00:22:04,975 --> 00:22:06,509
As you pointed out,

559
00:22:06,577 --> 00:22:08,611
the "B" team drafted
this suit in the first place.

560
00:22:08,679 --> 00:22:11,080
- And ran you out of Dodge.
- Right into Jersey.

561
00:22:11,148 --> 00:22:14,684
Well, if he doesn't do well,
he can always approach my client

562
00:22:14,751 --> 00:22:17,720
outside of her place
of employment, again.

563
00:22:19,022 --> 00:22:20,389
Hmm?

564
00:22:20,457 --> 00:22:21,591
I guess he must
have learned from you

565
00:22:21,658 --> 00:22:23,326
not to always tell dad
what he's up to.

566
00:22:23,393 --> 00:22:24,694
You want to know
what he learned from me?

567
00:22:24,761 --> 00:22:30,333
Not to let some two-time loser
get in his head.

568
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,767
Miss Eton,
there's been a lot of talk

569
00:22:31,835 --> 00:22:33,669
about the affair you had
while at Pearson Hardman.

570
00:22:33,737 --> 00:22:35,805
I have just one question.

571
00:22:35,873 --> 00:22:37,540
Who was that affair with?

572
00:22:37,608 --> 00:22:39,442
I never said I had an affair.

573
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:41,177
But your lawyer said you did.

574
00:22:41,245 --> 00:22:42,745
Your people said
it was irrelevant.

575
00:22:42,813 --> 00:22:44,013
I didn't, and it's not,

576
00:22:44,081 --> 00:22:45,481
and I have a lot of questions
about it.

577
00:22:45,549 --> 00:22:46,916
Which we won't be answering.

578
00:22:46,984 --> 00:22:49,385
- Well, you'll have to in court.
- We're not in court.

579
00:22:49,453 --> 00:22:51,554
No, but you are on the record.

580
00:22:51,622 --> 00:22:53,289
But since you don't want
to answer the question,

581
00:22:53,357 --> 00:22:54,924
let me ask you
another question.

582
00:22:54,992 --> 00:22:56,425
If you didn't have an affair,

583
00:22:56,493 --> 00:22:58,161
then what reason could there
possibly be

584
00:22:58,228 --> 00:23:01,030
for you to be fired?

585
00:23:01,098 --> 00:23:02,331
Because I was being harassed,

586
00:23:02,399 --> 00:23:03,839
and I made it clear
I didn't like it.

587
00:23:03,867 --> 00:23:04,901
Harassed? By who?

588
00:23:04,968 --> 00:23:05,902
- Don't answer that.
- Oh, no.

589
00:23:05,969 --> 00:23:07,236
My client is going

590
00:23:07,304 --> 00:23:09,472
to answer the question
that your associate asked,

591
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:11,340
and we're gonna get some things
on the record, right here.

592
00:23:11,408 --> 00:23:12,608
- No, we're done.
- I was being harassed

593
00:23:12,676 --> 00:23:13,809
by Louis Litt.

594
00:23:13,877 --> 00:23:16,279
What?

595
00:23:16,346 --> 00:23:19,015
Go on, Monica.

596
00:23:19,082 --> 00:23:20,483
He asked me out repeatedly,

597
00:23:20,551 --> 00:23:23,252
after I rebuffed him
again and again.

598
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:26,556
He would stare at me, wait at
the elevator outside my office,

599
00:23:26,623 --> 00:23:28,457
the diner, everywhere.

600
00:23:28,525 --> 00:23:30,560
- Anything else?
- Yes.

601
00:23:30,627 --> 00:23:33,196
He was partner, and I had
to say "no" to him.

602
00:23:33,263 --> 00:23:35,865
And it made me feel disgusting
every single day.

603
00:23:35,933 --> 00:23:37,633
Will people corroborate
your account?

604
00:23:37,701 --> 00:23:39,902
It was common knowledge
within the firm.

605
00:23:39,970 --> 00:23:42,972
Any number of people knew,
including him.

606
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,574
Let the record show
that my client

607
00:23:44,641 --> 00:23:46,108
indicated Harvey Specter.

608
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:48,844
Monica, I have one more question
for you.

609
00:23:48,912 --> 00:23:51,881
To whom did Jessica tell you
to hand in your resignation?

610
00:23:51,949 --> 00:23:53,249
Louis Litt.

611
00:23:53,317 --> 00:23:55,184
So in conclusion,

612
00:23:55,252 --> 00:23:57,753
you were being
sexually harassed,

613
00:23:57,821 --> 00:24:01,023
it was well-known,
Jessica Pearson dismissed you,

614
00:24:01,091 --> 00:24:04,493
and you were actually told
to hand in your resignation

615
00:24:04,561 --> 00:24:07,363
to the very man
who did the harassing.

616
00:24:07,431 --> 00:24:10,399
Yes.
That statement is entirely true.

617
00:24:14,371 --> 00:24:18,040
Gentlemen?

618
00:24:18,108 --> 00:24:20,710
I get it, that was your plan,

619
00:24:20,777 --> 00:24:22,845
to blame it on Louis
the whole time.

620
00:24:22,913 --> 00:24:25,414
Monica always was
a good lawyer.

621
00:24:25,482 --> 00:24:28,951
Nothing she said in there
wasn't true.

622
00:24:29,019 --> 00:24:30,386
What's it gonna take
to settle this case?

623
00:24:30,454 --> 00:24:32,355
What ever do you mean?

624
00:24:32,422 --> 00:24:34,857
We break confidentiality,
Monica loses,

625
00:24:34,925 --> 00:24:36,125
you get your $15 million.

626
00:24:36,193 --> 00:24:37,460
Tempting.

627
00:24:37,527 --> 00:24:39,729
But we're not gonna do that,
and you know it.

628
00:24:39,796 --> 00:24:41,931
So you want to settle
with Monica

629
00:24:41,999 --> 00:24:43,332
and get out of your jam.

630
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,701
I want a number, and it better
be less than three.

631
00:24:45,769 --> 00:24:47,036
This isn't about numbers.

632
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:48,804
It's about responsibility.

633
00:24:48,872 --> 00:24:50,973
Monica wants to see
a jury find Jessica guilty.

634
00:24:51,041 --> 00:24:52,208
Bullshit.

635
00:24:52,276 --> 00:24:55,177
You want to see a jury
find Jessica guilty.

636
00:24:55,245 --> 00:24:58,314
Nope.
I assure you, it is Monica.

637
00:24:58,382 --> 00:24:59,415
I don't really care
whether a jury

638
00:24:59,483 --> 00:25:01,817
finds Jessica guilty or not.

639
00:25:01,885 --> 00:25:03,152
You just want blood.

640
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:05,821
- It's already there.
- Because of you.

641
00:25:05,889 --> 00:25:08,257
Huh. Nonetheless, I smell it.

642
00:25:08,325 --> 00:25:10,993
Allison Holt, Robert Zane
both came after you,

643
00:25:11,061 --> 00:25:14,997
and now you have 45 cases
you can't afford.

644
00:25:15,065 --> 00:25:18,701
So pay me $15 million,
fight Monica, and lose.

645
00:25:18,769 --> 00:25:20,403
Fight Monica and win.

646
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:22,471
It doesn't matter.

647
00:25:22,539 --> 00:25:23,572
Any way you slice it,

648
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:26,676
I'm gonna bleed you dry.

649
00:25:35,053 --> 00:25:37,221
[Knock on glass]

650
00:25:37,289 --> 00:25:40,157
They promised a brunette.

651
00:25:40,225 --> 00:25:41,425
Well, I guess there's a few.

652
00:25:41,493 --> 00:25:45,329
I want to talk to you
like a person.

653
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:50,768
Kenny G?

654
00:25:53,739 --> 00:25:55,406
What's on your mind, Louis?

655
00:25:55,474 --> 00:25:57,708
I know Donna told me that, uh,
you didn't need my help,

656
00:25:57,776 --> 00:25:59,137
and I know we haven't
really spoken

657
00:25:59,144 --> 00:26:03,147
since you ripped up
my letter of resignation.

658
00:26:03,215 --> 00:26:05,249
But I want to help.

659
00:26:05,317 --> 00:26:06,484
I need to help.

660
00:26:06,552 --> 00:26:08,286
Trust me. It's not a good idea.

661
00:26:08,353 --> 00:26:12,089
He's using Monica
the same way that he used me.

662
00:26:13,692 --> 00:26:16,994
And no one knows that
better than me.

663
00:26:17,062 --> 00:26:18,829
I know.

664
00:26:18,897 --> 00:26:20,064
If I could just talk
to her outside

665
00:26:20,132 --> 00:26:21,232
the confines of everything,
you know?

666
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:22,767
If I could...

667
00:26:22,834 --> 00:26:25,403
I just know I can convince her
to drop this case, I know it.

668
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:26,404
- Louis...
- Harvey, please.

669
00:26:26,471 --> 00:26:28,506
I'm begging you.

670
00:26:34,346 --> 00:26:37,048
What's this? Just read it.

671
00:26:44,723 --> 00:26:46,891
Mike led the deposition.

672
00:26:46,959 --> 00:26:49,627
[Laughs] Starts off bold.

673
00:26:49,695 --> 00:26:50,975
Oh, he shouldn't have
asked that.

674
00:26:51,029 --> 00:26:54,765
That's a rookie move.

675
00:26:54,833 --> 00:26:56,601
What... what?

676
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:11,148
"Rebuffed again and again."

677
00:27:13,418 --> 00:27:17,121
She felt disgusted.

678
00:27:17,189 --> 00:27:18,756
"Common knowledge." Louis...

679
00:27:18,824 --> 00:27:21,525
She pointed at you.

680
00:27:21,593 --> 00:27:23,273
- That doesn't mean...
- No, no, no, no, no.

681
00:27:23,328 --> 00:27:26,063
You used to tease me about her.

682
00:27:28,133 --> 00:27:30,234
Remember how I used
to stare at her?

683
00:27:30,302 --> 00:27:32,503
That was teasing.

684
00:27:32,571 --> 00:27:34,672
This is bullshit.

685
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:37,508
- They're twisting everything.
- They are.

686
00:27:40,746 --> 00:27:42,813
He is.

687
00:27:42,881 --> 00:27:45,716
Drink your drink.

688
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:03,334
What are you doing here?

689
00:28:03,402 --> 00:28:05,636
I needed some air.

690
00:28:05,704 --> 00:28:07,271
How'd you know
how to get up here?

691
00:28:07,339 --> 00:28:09,907
- Donna. You?
- Donna.

692
00:28:17,349 --> 00:28:19,950
I lied.

693
00:28:20,018 --> 00:28:22,720
- The essay?
- I couldn't do it.

694
00:28:22,788 --> 00:28:24,389
Just think of it
like a closing argument.

695
00:28:24,456 --> 00:28:26,424
Why should they take you?
Exactly.

696
00:28:26,491 --> 00:28:29,193
Why should they take me?

697
00:28:29,261 --> 00:28:30,327
Why do you want to be a lawyer?

698
00:28:30,395 --> 00:28:31,996
Just... don't think, tell me.

699
00:28:32,064 --> 00:28:34,765
- My dad.
- Okay. Why?

700
00:28:37,235 --> 00:28:38,669
Do you remember when I told you

701
00:28:38,737 --> 00:28:40,438
that, when I was a little girl,
people would just tell him

702
00:28:40,505 --> 00:28:42,773
how smart he was?

703
00:28:42,841 --> 00:28:44,709
Right, it had nothing to do
with him being black or white,

704
00:28:44,776 --> 00:28:47,912
he was just amazing.

705
00:28:47,979 --> 00:28:51,882
And I want to be amazing too.

706
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:53,784
You are.

707
00:28:53,852 --> 00:28:55,820
Am I?

708
00:28:55,887 --> 00:28:58,522
Because every time I sit down
at that keyboard, I think,

709
00:28:58,590 --> 00:29:01,192
"I'm a paralegal.
That's all I've ever been.

710
00:29:01,259 --> 00:29:03,594
That's all I'll ever be."

711
00:29:03,662 --> 00:29:06,831
Did I ever tell you
about my interview with Harvey?

712
00:29:06,898 --> 00:29:09,934
No... But I'm assuming
it went well.

713
00:29:10,001 --> 00:29:13,604
He laughed me out of the room.

714
00:29:13,672 --> 00:29:15,406
- Are you kidding?
- No, I'm not.

715
00:29:15,474 --> 00:29:17,794
He basically told me I didn't
even belong in the interview.

716
00:29:17,809 --> 00:29:20,778
He actually told me to leave.

717
00:29:20,846 --> 00:29:22,413
What did you do?

718
00:29:22,481 --> 00:29:23,714
I decided I didn't give a shit

719
00:29:23,782 --> 00:29:26,584
what the other applicants had
that I didn't.

720
00:29:26,651 --> 00:29:27,818
If I was going
through that door,

721
00:29:27,886 --> 00:29:29,954
he'd have to pick me up
and throw me out.

722
00:29:30,021 --> 00:29:32,923
You must have said something.

723
00:29:32,991 --> 00:29:35,059
Yeah.

724
00:29:35,127 --> 00:29:36,527
Yeah, I told him
I'd be the best damn lawyer

725
00:29:36,595 --> 00:29:41,065
he'd ever seen.

726
00:29:41,133 --> 00:29:44,268
I wish I could have been
a fly on that wall.

727
00:29:44,336 --> 00:29:45,936
Yeah, you have no idea.

728
00:29:46,004 --> 00:29:48,239
[Laughs]

729
00:29:48,306 --> 00:29:51,175
[Chuckles]

730
00:29:56,748 --> 00:29:58,616
What the hell
is wrong with you?

731
00:29:58,683 --> 00:29:59,784
Me?

732
00:29:59,851 --> 00:30:00,918
You tried to settle
with Daniel.

733
00:30:00,986 --> 00:30:02,286
You're damn right I did.

734
00:30:02,354 --> 00:30:04,054
Did you read what happened
in that deposition?

735
00:30:04,122 --> 00:30:05,956
I don't care what happened
in that deposition.

736
00:30:06,024 --> 00:30:08,159
I do. You're out of control.

737
00:30:08,226 --> 00:30:09,493
What did you just say to me?

738
00:30:09,561 --> 00:30:10,928
Mike Ross wasn't ready
for this.

739
00:30:10,996 --> 00:30:13,364
- He volunteered.
- He went to see Monica Eton.

740
00:30:13,431 --> 00:30:14,632
You've done the same.

741
00:30:14,699 --> 00:30:17,735
I'm a senior partner,
not an associate.

742
00:30:17,803 --> 00:30:21,806
Me to you, you to him.

743
00:30:21,873 --> 00:30:25,442
Fine.

744
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:27,190
You want to know
why he went to see Monica?

745
00:30:27,212 --> 00:30:28,512
I'm sure you're gonna tell me.

746
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:30,214
Because he doesn't know
the idea to stir her up

747
00:30:30,282 --> 00:30:32,516
against Daniel was yours
in the first place.

748
00:30:32,584 --> 00:30:34,885
He doesn't need to know.

749
00:30:34,953 --> 00:30:36,353
So you don't trust him
with that,

750
00:30:36,421 --> 00:30:38,956
but you trust him to go up
against Daniel himself.

751
00:30:39,024 --> 00:30:41,258
He came to me with a way
to put us back in a position

752
00:30:41,326 --> 00:30:42,760
to win Folsom Foods.

753
00:30:42,828 --> 00:30:45,029
Well, it failed.
We're behind on both.

754
00:30:45,096 --> 00:30:46,530
- Excuse me.
- Mike.

755
00:30:46,598 --> 00:30:50,100
I just wanted to apologize
to you both for yesterday.

756
00:30:50,168 --> 00:30:51,569
It was a good idea,

757
00:30:51,636 --> 00:30:52,937
just didn't have
the right execution.

758
00:30:53,004 --> 00:30:55,606
- What are you saying?
- I'm saying it was a good idea,

759
00:30:55,674 --> 00:31:00,311
but the questions were being
asked of the wrong person.

760
00:31:02,981 --> 00:31:05,282
Three on one.

761
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:07,751
All for a deposition
of little, old me.

762
00:31:07,819 --> 00:31:10,087
Would you be more comfortable
over there,

763
00:31:10,155 --> 00:31:11,555
where your old desk used to be?

764
00:31:11,623 --> 00:31:14,191
No need. We won't be here long.

765
00:31:14,259 --> 00:31:17,328
Our confidentiality agreement
prohibits most questions.

766
00:31:17,395 --> 00:31:19,663
Actually,
it only prohibits disclosures.

767
00:31:19,731 --> 00:31:22,233
We can ask you any question that
any lawyer who hadn't signed

768
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:24,568
a non-disclosure agreement
could ask.

769
00:31:24,636 --> 00:31:26,170
We just can't make statements.

770
00:31:26,238 --> 00:31:29,874
I'm sure if you were
to ask Judge Henderson,

771
00:31:29,941 --> 00:31:35,079
say, out by his pool,
he would agree.

772
00:31:35,146 --> 00:31:36,447
There's no court reporter here.

773
00:31:36,514 --> 00:31:39,850
I thought you might want
to talk off the record.

774
00:31:39,918 --> 00:31:41,485
[Camera powers down]
If you ask me anything

775
00:31:41,553 --> 00:31:43,921
about embezzlement,
I'll deny it.

776
00:31:43,989 --> 00:31:45,222
If you bring any proof forward,

777
00:31:45,290 --> 00:31:46,824
it's a violation
of our non-disclosure.

778
00:31:46,892 --> 00:31:49,193
That's why we won't be asking
about your embezzlement.

779
00:31:49,261 --> 00:31:51,395
We'll be asking you
about your affair with Monica.

780
00:31:51,463 --> 00:31:52,963
And if you lie about that,

781
00:31:53,031 --> 00:31:55,332
we won't be the ones who need
to come forward with proof.

782
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,834
Because we found six people
working at the hotel

783
00:31:56,902 --> 00:31:59,036
who are willing to provide it.

784
00:31:59,104 --> 00:32:00,905
No, you didn't.

785
00:32:00,972 --> 00:32:03,974
Room service,
concierge, housekeeping.

786
00:32:04,042 --> 00:32:05,609
You really should tip better,
Daniel.

787
00:32:05,677 --> 00:32:06,744
Maybe you want a cigarette?

788
00:32:06,811 --> 00:32:10,748
Remind you of the woman
you cheated on.

789
00:32:14,085 --> 00:32:16,453
[Camera powers on]

790
00:32:16,521 --> 00:32:18,389
Go ahead. Ask your questions.

791
00:32:18,456 --> 00:32:19,976
Did you have an affair
with Monica Eton

792
00:32:20,025 --> 00:32:21,592
while you were employed
at Pearson Hardman?

793
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:24,194
Yes, I did.
Any other questions?

794
00:32:24,262 --> 00:32:26,363
I think we're good.

795
00:32:26,431 --> 00:32:29,366
Yep.
You got me to embarrass myself.

796
00:32:29,434 --> 00:32:31,735
But you already did that,
the day you told everyone

797
00:32:31,803 --> 00:32:33,443
in the office
about my affair with Monica.

798
00:32:33,471 --> 00:32:35,272
You and you.

799
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:37,675
Yeah, I know
what you told Monica

800
00:32:37,742 --> 00:32:39,710
about Jessica not knowing.

801
00:32:39,778 --> 00:32:41,578
But take a good look.

802
00:32:41,646 --> 00:32:44,915
She was behind it.

803
00:32:44,983 --> 00:32:48,552
Who needs a cigarette now?

804
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:50,387
And as far
as my admission goes?

805
00:32:50,455 --> 00:32:51,816
You're still the one
who fired her,

806
00:32:51,823 --> 00:32:53,524
24 hours after you found out.

807
00:32:53,591 --> 00:32:55,592
That's what a jury's
gonna focus on.

808
00:32:55,660 --> 00:33:00,164
Nobody's gonna care
about what I did.

809
00:33:17,182 --> 00:33:19,416
You piece of shit.

810
00:33:19,484 --> 00:33:21,118
There's the fire
I helped nurture.

811
00:33:21,186 --> 00:33:22,453
You didn't nurture
a goddamn thing.

812
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:23,754
You don't teach.

813
00:33:23,822 --> 00:33:26,090
You don't inspire.
You don't mentor.

814
00:33:26,157 --> 00:33:27,791
All you do is betray.

815
00:33:27,859 --> 00:33:29,526
Like you betrayed me
at that last vote.

816
00:33:29,594 --> 00:33:32,262
- How dare you.
- How dare I what?

817
00:33:32,330 --> 00:33:33,998
You were more than happy
to help out

818
00:33:34,065 --> 00:33:35,366
when it served your purposes.

819
00:33:35,433 --> 00:33:36,867
I voted the way
I did the second I realized

820
00:33:36,935 --> 00:33:37,968
it was all a lie.

821
00:33:38,036 --> 00:33:39,737
And look how it turned out.

822
00:33:39,804 --> 00:33:41,138
You're a senior partner now.

823
00:33:41,206 --> 00:33:43,507
You're welcome.
You think I give a shit?

824
00:33:43,575 --> 00:33:46,010
I think that's all
you ever cared about.

825
00:33:46,077 --> 00:33:47,778
You know what I cared about?

826
00:33:47,846 --> 00:33:49,013
Monica.

827
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:51,315
She was so smart
and so beautiful.

828
00:33:51,383 --> 00:33:52,616
And I knew she was
out of my league,

829
00:33:52,684 --> 00:33:53,751
but I kept trying
because I just thought

830
00:33:53,818 --> 00:33:56,987
if she just got to know me...

831
00:33:59,224 --> 00:34:01,225
and then I found out
that whole time she was...

832
00:34:01,292 --> 00:34:04,495
- With me.
- Yeah. With you.

833
00:34:04,562 --> 00:34:08,832
Why are you telling me this?

834
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:12,236
I want you to know exactly
what it is that you twisted,

835
00:34:12,303 --> 00:34:17,007
so you know exactly what it was
that put me over the edge.

836
00:34:17,075 --> 00:34:18,709
Are you threatening me, Louis?

837
00:34:18,777 --> 00:34:21,445
Threatening you?
No, I'm telling you.

838
00:34:21,513 --> 00:34:24,715
You ever do anything
to me ever again,

839
00:34:24,783 --> 00:34:29,253
you ever so much as tell me
the incorrect time,

840
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:31,789
I'll kill you.

841
00:34:31,856 --> 00:34:35,993
I will rip your smug face
off your fat neck,

842
00:34:36,061 --> 00:34:39,563
and I'll kill you.

843
00:34:59,352 --> 00:35:01,119
You here to depose me again?

844
00:35:01,187 --> 00:35:03,755
Didn't go too well
for you last time.

845
00:35:03,823 --> 00:35:06,358
No, I'm here to say I'm sorry.

846
00:35:06,426 --> 00:35:09,027
You were right...
about Jessica.

847
00:35:10,763 --> 00:35:13,298
You really didn't know
it was her.

848
00:35:13,366 --> 00:35:15,033
Welcome to the world.

849
00:35:15,101 --> 00:35:16,735
Stings, doesn't it? Yeah.

850
00:35:16,803 --> 00:35:18,603
It does.

851
00:35:18,671 --> 00:35:20,639
So you came all the way here
just to tell me you're sorry?

852
00:35:20,706 --> 00:35:22,541
No, I didn't.

853
00:35:22,608 --> 00:35:25,210
Jessica was wrong to fire you,

854
00:35:25,278 --> 00:35:26,945
but she didn't fire you
because you're a woman.

855
00:35:27,013 --> 00:35:28,747
She fired you
because she didn't trust you.

856
00:35:28,815 --> 00:35:30,449
- I know that.
- So then you also know

857
00:35:30,516 --> 00:35:33,151
that keeping this suit alive
is sticking it to her.

858
00:35:33,219 --> 00:35:34,519
That's the whole point.

859
00:35:34,587 --> 00:35:35,787
No, the whole point
is that she's not

860
00:35:35,855 --> 00:35:37,222
the only one
you're sticking it to.

861
00:35:37,290 --> 00:35:39,758
What I said about Louis Litt
is factually accurate.

862
00:35:39,826 --> 00:35:41,359
And if you think I'm gonna drop
the case because of him, I'm...

863
00:35:41,427 --> 00:35:43,128
I'm not talking about him.

864
00:35:43,196 --> 00:35:45,764
I'm talking about the 113 women
who are suing.

865
00:35:45,832 --> 00:35:48,834
Folsom Foods right now
for gender discrimination.

866
00:35:48,901 --> 00:35:52,204
Those cases
are their own thing.

867
00:35:52,271 --> 00:35:54,105
They're being told
they can't get where they want

868
00:35:54,173 --> 00:35:55,872
because they're not
good enough.

869
00:35:55,897 --> 00:35:57,309
That has nothing to do with me.

870
00:35:57,310 --> 00:36:00,011
[Scoffs] Who's being naive now?

871
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:01,999
He's using your suit
to drive us into the ground,

872
00:36:02,048 --> 00:36:05,383
and driving us into the ground
means losing these cases.

873
00:36:05,451 --> 00:36:08,019
What do you want?

874
00:36:08,087 --> 00:36:11,656
Just read these files.
Decide for yourself.

875
00:36:11,724 --> 00:36:15,927
These women deserve to be
treated the same way you were?

876
00:36:15,995 --> 00:36:19,531
What makes you think
I would even care?

877
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:22,334
I'm naive, remember?

878
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:36,681
Mike Ross went
to see Monica Eton again.

879
00:36:36,749 --> 00:36:39,017
- At your direction?
- On his own.

880
00:36:39,085 --> 00:36:40,886
Goddamn kid.

881
00:36:40,953 --> 00:36:43,088
He's another you. Not exactly.

882
00:36:43,155 --> 00:36:46,758
He went to apologize for lying
to her the first time.

883
00:36:46,826 --> 00:36:48,193
- He didn't lie.
- No.

884
00:36:48,261 --> 00:36:50,061
We did.

885
00:36:50,129 --> 00:36:53,031
Like the two of you lied to me
about him being a lawyer?

886
00:36:53,099 --> 00:36:54,432
How about we call it even?

887
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:57,569
It's nowhere near even.

888
00:36:59,505 --> 00:37:01,473
- Isn't it?
- What's this?

889
00:37:01,541 --> 00:37:02,707
He got her to settle.

890
00:37:02,775 --> 00:37:06,945
- There wasn't an offer.
- There is now.

891
00:37:07,013 --> 00:37:08,446
This does not get us off easy.

892
00:37:08,514 --> 00:37:10,115
Hell of a lot less
than $15 million.

893
00:37:10,182 --> 00:37:12,250
- She doesn't deserve a dime.
- Doesn't matter.

894
00:37:12,318 --> 00:37:13,852
I was right to fire her.

895
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:18,189
That's not what this is about,
and you know it.

896
00:37:25,865 --> 00:37:30,335
He made me look
like a fool with her then,

897
00:37:30,403 --> 00:37:33,538
and he's made me look
like a fool with her now.

898
00:37:33,606 --> 00:37:35,874
No one cares what he said
in that deposition.

899
00:37:35,942 --> 00:37:38,109
You think I give a shit about
what he said in that deposition?

900
00:37:38,177 --> 00:37:40,211
I meant getting me
to sign that agreement.

901
00:37:40,279 --> 00:37:41,813
You can't win every move.

902
00:37:41,881 --> 00:37:43,381
I should have seen it coming.

903
00:37:43,449 --> 00:37:44,983
You made a decision
under the gun.

904
00:37:45,051 --> 00:37:47,252
- I let him put me there.
- We beat him

905
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:51,690
because you kept your cool
when I wanted to lose mine.

906
00:37:51,757 --> 00:37:54,793
Keep your cool now,
sign this agreement,

907
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:58,163
and let's beat him again.

908
00:38:06,072 --> 00:38:08,306
You look happy.

909
00:38:08,374 --> 00:38:10,141
So do you.

910
00:38:10,209 --> 00:38:13,845
The pressure's off.
No more essay.

911
00:38:13,913 --> 00:38:16,214
- You finished it.
- I had a breakthrough.

912
00:38:16,282 --> 00:38:19,451
Uhoh. What was it?

913
00:38:19,518 --> 00:38:20,785
I'm a paralegal.

914
00:38:20,853 --> 00:38:22,754
Rachel, please tell me
that that doesn't...

915
00:38:22,822 --> 00:38:25,023
No, I don't...
I don't mean that in a bad way.

916
00:38:25,091 --> 00:38:26,257
I mean it in a great way.

917
00:38:26,325 --> 00:38:27,592
Do you know what the length

918
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:30,195
of an average corporate lawyer's
career is?

919
00:38:30,262 --> 00:38:31,262
30 years.

920
00:38:31,330 --> 00:38:33,498
Wrong.

921
00:38:36,769 --> 00:38:39,137
- Whoa!
- Because they hate it.

922
00:38:39,205 --> 00:38:40,572
Not me.

923
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,707
I've been here longer than 75%
of our associates,

924
00:38:42,775 --> 00:38:44,275
and I love it.

925
00:38:44,343 --> 00:38:47,112
Which means when you get out,
you won't be disillusioned.

926
00:38:47,179 --> 00:38:49,714
No. I'll be unleashed.

927
00:38:49,782 --> 00:38:52,017
And that's what I told them
in my essay.

928
00:38:52,084 --> 00:38:53,518
In other words...
You're gonna be

929
00:38:53,586 --> 00:38:55,320
the best damn lawyer
they've ever seen.

930
00:38:55,388 --> 00:38:57,389
- I'm going to Harvard.
- You really are.

931
00:38:57,456 --> 00:39:00,492
[Laughs] Yeah. Yeah.

932
00:39:04,864 --> 00:39:05,930
What?

933
00:39:05,998 --> 00:39:10,201
Oh, nothing.
It just... just hit me.

934
00:39:10,269 --> 00:39:12,871
You're not gonna
be here anymore.

935
00:39:12,938 --> 00:39:15,206
I mean, you'll...
you know, you'll be there.

936
00:39:15,274 --> 00:39:18,743
Boston. Cambridge.

937
00:39:18,811 --> 00:39:23,648
I guess I'll just have
to get used to that.

938
00:39:23,716 --> 00:39:26,618
I guess I'll have
to get used to that too.

939
00:39:32,725 --> 00:39:34,559
[Elevator dings]

940
00:39:34,627 --> 00:39:35,827
You going home?

941
00:39:35,895 --> 00:39:37,328
Unless there's
something pressing?

942
00:39:37,396 --> 00:39:38,997
- No, I was just gonna, uh...
- Hey, what happened here?

943
00:39:39,065 --> 00:39:40,298
What are you talking about?

944
00:39:40,366 --> 00:39:43,201
- It's off.
- Looks fine to me.

945
00:39:43,269 --> 00:39:47,972
It isn't.

946
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:50,642
Wait a second.
Your eye for detail?

947
00:39:50,710 --> 00:39:53,678
One record askew, and I don't
hear the end of it for a week.

948
00:39:53,746 --> 00:39:57,549
You scratched my Miles Davis.

949
00:39:59,585 --> 00:40:00,752
It was me.

950
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:02,554
- What were you thinking?
- I was pissed.

951
00:40:02,621 --> 00:40:04,422
- You're so emotional.
- I lost my cool.

952
00:40:04,490 --> 00:40:06,224
- You shouldn't have done that.
- I know.

953
00:40:06,292 --> 00:40:08,927
I shouldn't have hit Hardman.

954
00:40:08,994 --> 00:40:10,195
- You didn't.
- I did.

955
00:40:10,262 --> 00:40:12,697
- When?
- Right before Jessica's depo.

956
00:40:12,765 --> 00:40:14,766
- Closed fist?
- Open palm.

957
00:40:14,834 --> 00:40:16,568
- Bitch slap!
- Damn straight.

958
00:40:16,635 --> 00:40:17,736
How'd it feel?

959
00:40:17,803 --> 00:40:19,043
Good enough
that I did it again.

960
00:40:19,071 --> 00:40:20,371
[Laughter]

961
00:40:20,439 --> 00:40:22,440
Look at you. You're beautiful.

962
00:40:22,508 --> 00:40:25,844
You have a date?
As a matter of fact, I do.

963
00:40:25,911 --> 00:40:27,779
Bitter and barren, my ass.

964
00:40:27,847 --> 00:40:28,980
Someone special?

965
00:40:29,048 --> 00:40:32,350
You never know.
Could be the one.

966
00:40:32,418 --> 00:40:35,420
[Elevator dings]

967
00:40:35,488 --> 00:40:38,890
Oh, and why don't you go ahead
and take that damn name down.

968
00:40:46,899 --> 00:40:50,602
You keep showing up here,
Laura's gonna kick your ass.

969
00:40:50,669 --> 00:40:53,037
Oh, you'd be surprised at
the strength of a jealous woman.

970
00:40:53,105 --> 00:40:56,040
[Laughs]
She has nothing to worry about.

971
00:40:56,108 --> 00:40:57,575
[Chuckles]

972
00:40:57,643 --> 00:40:59,944
Once again, I guess you're
not here to ask for a favor.

973
00:41:00,012 --> 00:41:02,480
You want to know who Daniel is?

974
00:41:02,548 --> 00:41:06,384
Read his own words.

975
00:41:06,452 --> 00:41:09,487
He's not the first man
to have an affair.

976
00:41:09,555 --> 00:41:11,122
Maybe the first
to turn around and sue

977
00:41:11,190 --> 00:41:13,324
his former colleagues
for his own actions.

978
00:41:13,392 --> 00:41:14,959
[Laughs] That's all you have?

979
00:41:15,027 --> 00:41:16,327
Tip of the iceberg.

980
00:41:16,395 --> 00:41:19,697
Believe me, he will turn on you
if you let him in.

981
00:41:19,765 --> 00:41:21,833
No one's letting him in.
He's a contractor.

982
00:41:21,901 --> 00:41:23,802
He's not a partner,
he's not of counsel,

983
00:41:23,869 --> 00:41:25,904
he's not an associate.
I'm telling you,

984
00:41:25,971 --> 00:41:28,252
kick him off of Folsom Foods.
Don't let him in your house.

985
00:41:28,307 --> 00:41:30,575
And I just told you,
he's not in my house.

986
00:41:30,643 --> 00:41:33,978
You're in my house.

987
00:41:34,046 --> 00:41:35,880
What if our houses
were the same?

988
00:41:35,948 --> 00:41:39,050
Oh, now.
You're moving pretty fast.

989
00:41:39,118 --> 00:41:41,419
I told you,
my wife's the jealous type.

990
00:41:41,487 --> 00:41:44,022
You offered a merger once.

991
00:41:44,089 --> 00:41:47,826
Let's settle these cases,
get it done.

992
00:41:49,195 --> 00:41:50,428
You hate him that much?

993
00:41:50,496 --> 00:41:53,064
Yes or no?

994
00:41:53,132 --> 00:41:54,432
Here's the problem.

995
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:55,767
Merger looked good before,

996
00:41:55,835 --> 00:41:58,136
but now we have you
on the ropes.

997
00:41:58,204 --> 00:42:02,140
So when Pearson whatever
goes under,

998
00:42:02,208 --> 00:42:04,209
we'll pick up the pieces
for free.

999
00:42:04,276 --> 00:42:06,411
You do not have us
on the ropes.

1000
00:42:06,478 --> 00:42:08,146
Oh, you'll get it tomorrow.

1001
00:42:08,214 --> 00:42:10,248
We're filing to try
seven different cases

1002
00:42:10,316 --> 00:42:13,618
in seven different jurisdictions
all at the same time.

1003
00:42:13,686 --> 00:42:15,753
- Rocket docket.
- Yeah.

1004
00:42:15,821 --> 00:42:18,456
It was Daniel's idea.

1005
00:42:18,524 --> 00:42:21,426
He'll see you in court.
