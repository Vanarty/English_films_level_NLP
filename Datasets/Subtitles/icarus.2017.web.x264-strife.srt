1
00:00:30,947 --> 00:00:32,699
Line drive to right field...

2
00:00:32,782 --> 00:00:35,785
Solemnly swear the testimony
you're about to give will be the truth...

3
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:39,831
I have never,
ever failed a drug test.

4
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:43,293
Before, during and after the Olympics.

5
00:00:44,043 --> 00:00:47,380
Over 160 drug tests.

6
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:50,467
I have never failed a test.

7
00:00:51,426 --> 00:00:54,220
For the record,
have you ever used human growth hormone

8
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:57,265
or any other performance-enhancing
substance?

9
00:00:58,015 --> 00:00:59,016
No.

10
00:00:59,101 --> 00:01:01,181
I'm trying
to make sure your testimony's clear.

11
00:01:01,228 --> 00:01:02,955
How many times
do I have to say it?

12
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:04,314
I've never taken drugs.

13
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:06,274
You're winning
the Tour de France...

14
00:01:06,358 --> 00:01:07,558
How clear is that?

15
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:08,878
Win the Tour de France,

16
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:12,197
like the all-time greats
who've ever won this big event.

17
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,407
Extraordinary accusations...

18
00:01:14,907 --> 00:01:19,329
must be followed up
with extraordinary proof.

19
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:24,084
And they have not come up
with extraordinary proof.

20
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:43,520
See...

21
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:46,939
We have...

22
00:01:47,565 --> 00:01:50,610
this mountain bike.

23
00:01:52,862 --> 00:01:54,447
Loading up the Thule rack.

24
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:59,285
And this is my entire life
in the car right now,

25
00:01:59,702 --> 00:02:02,664
set up, ready for insanity.

26
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:08,002
I'm getting ready for the single hardest
amateur cycling event in the world.

27
00:02:08,085 --> 00:02:11,756
It's basically a miniature Tour de France
for insane people.

28
00:02:11,839 --> 00:02:14,926
Does it qualify for anything
if you do well with it?

29
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:16,219
Yeah, stupidity.

30
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:25,186
I've been riding for 28 years seriously,
but never as a professional.

31
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:28,773
Going to these massive amateur events
that are not professional,

32
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:33,987
but, I mean, there's serious guys there.
And the...

33
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:37,365
- Max! He loves... He's got a foot fetish.
- It tickles!

34
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:44,372
I certainly didn't know
when I started on this

35
00:02:44,872 --> 00:02:46,291
what it was gonna lead to.

36
00:02:49,794 --> 00:02:52,129
When LeMond won that first Tour de France,

37
00:02:52,214 --> 00:02:54,507
I was in seventh grade, I think.

38
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:58,010
Can you believe it?
After over 2,000 miles...

39
00:02:58,094 --> 00:03:00,137
His name in French means "the world,"

40
00:03:00,222 --> 00:03:02,682
and this is the world of Greg LeMond
in Paris today.

41
00:03:02,765 --> 00:03:05,142
Being the first American
to win it,

42
00:03:05,227 --> 00:03:07,354
it really brought me into the sport.

43
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:10,648
I ate a wheel
going about 40 miles an hour.

44
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:15,028
I spent my entire freshman year of college
with plastic teeth in my mouth.

45
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:17,488
I would've kept racing
if it wasn't for that.

46
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:18,907
He's really hurting...

47
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:23,160
Later, Armstrong came along.
That was a whole other ball of wax.

48
00:03:23,245 --> 00:03:25,455
Off the back wheel of Armstrong,

49
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:27,683
- they can't respond to pressure.
- The gap is there.

50
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:30,167
He is just going faster
and faster and faster.

51
00:03:30,252 --> 00:03:32,629
This has to be
the greatest comeback in any sport.

52
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:35,632
The fact that Armstrong managed
to conquer cancer was unbelievable.

53
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:38,468
Now he's riding at the front
of the Tour de France like a Trojan.

54
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:43,640
I think I'm a year
and a half younger than Lance.

55
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:46,183
He was kind of my hero.

56
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:51,231
For now,
I'd just like a yes or a no.

57
00:03:52,064 --> 00:03:56,027
Did you ever take banned substances
to enhance your cycling performance?

58
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:57,110
Yes.

59
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:06,496
I'd always suspected
that he had been doping.

60
00:04:08,122 --> 00:04:12,001
I felt that I didn't really wanna know.

61
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:16,881
Because a lot of the guys
that he raced with

62
00:04:16,964 --> 00:04:21,010
and guys who had raced against him
that I'd just known over the years...

63
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:23,638
they were my friends.

64
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:29,477
If you would've had your choice,
you would've never doped?

65
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:31,438
Ever?

66
00:04:32,229 --> 00:04:34,190
Up until it directly affected me,

67
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:37,819
I was like, "I think Lance is
probably clean."

68
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:39,963
I don't know.

69
00:04:39,987 --> 00:04:42,324
It's... messy.

70
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:50,164
The way they got him,
this is what nobody understood.

71
00:04:50,247 --> 00:04:53,000
150 times
over the last six years, I've been tested.

72
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:56,463
In competition, out of competition,
at home, at a race,

73
00:04:56,546 --> 00:05:00,008
Seven in the morning, seven at night,
whatever, and they're all clean.

74
00:05:01,133 --> 00:05:02,969
He never failed a drug test.

75
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:08,057
Solemnly swear the testimony
you're about to give will be the truth?

76
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:10,685
It was his teammates
who had turned on him

77
00:05:10,768 --> 00:05:12,770
as part of the federal investigation.

78
00:05:16,148 --> 00:05:21,613
If this guy had passed, whatever it is,
500 doping tests over his entire career,

79
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:25,157
clearly the system didn't work.

80
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:30,663
How many times did you test Lance
during his career?

81
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:34,626
As the laboratory of record,

82
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:39,672
I'm estimating that I would've tested him
50 times. 5-0.

83
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:44,093
So you tested Lance 50 times
and never caught him?

84
00:05:44,636 --> 00:05:45,887
Correct.

85
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:53,811
I developed and operated
the UCLA Olympic Laboratory for 25 years.

86
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:57,649
I'm known mostly for developing tests

87
00:05:57,732 --> 00:06:01,068
so that athletes get caught
if they're using drugs.

88
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:05,448
How did you
personally feel every year?

89
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:08,117
Did you believe that it was just Lance?

90
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:12,497
- Do you think that...
- They're all doping.

91
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:15,041
Every single one of 'em.

92
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:18,545
Unfortunately, the drugs work.

93
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:26,678
With certain knowledge, you can
get around the testing all the time.

94
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:29,556
It's really easy to beat.

95
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,016
Very easy.

96
00:06:33,685 --> 00:06:36,145
Originally, the idea that I had

97
00:06:36,228 --> 00:06:41,776
was to prove the system in place
to test athletes was bullshit.

98
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:48,450
I had read about the hardest
amateur cycling race on the planet,

99
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:50,034
this seven-day race

100
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:52,286
through the French Alps,
called the Haute Route.

101
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:59,335
If you were to take the hardest seven days
in the Tour de France,

102
00:06:59,418 --> 00:07:02,213
put 'em all together
back-to-back-to-back-to-back,

103
00:07:02,296 --> 00:07:05,467
that would be
what this Haute Route course was like.

104
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:10,680
The first year I did it totally clean.

105
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:14,559
There were 440 masochists.

106
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:19,564
My goal was to be in the top 100.

107
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:34,495
After seven days, 75,000 feet of climbing
and 1,000 miles...

108
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:39,501
I was destroyed.

109
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:48,718
But I finished 14th.

110
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:52,930
There's about ten guys, it seems,

111
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:56,934
that are on just another level
than everybody else.

112
00:07:58,435 --> 00:08:01,731
Then there's this next group,
and then there's me.

113
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:05,777
What did you think of the idea?

114
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:09,739
Well, in certain senses,
I like the idea.

115
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:14,368
It depends on what you consider
to be dangerous...

116
00:08:14,451 --> 00:08:15,495
Right.

117
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:18,456
Testing yourself on these drugs.

118
00:08:19,331 --> 00:08:23,670
But I was curious, you know,
how you were going to do it.

119
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:26,673
I might be willing to help
and advise and...

120
00:08:27,464 --> 00:08:29,175
avoid positives.

121
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:33,781
Are you gonna take drugs?

122
00:08:33,805 --> 00:08:36,641
Yeah. Basically, go through...

123
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:43,397
go through an entire doping program,
but overseen by the scientist.

124
00:08:44,148 --> 00:08:47,819
I'm gonna have Don Catlin design
a program for me

125
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:51,948
that's gonna get through every single one
of the doping controls in the world...

126
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:53,533
clean.

127
00:09:06,588 --> 00:09:10,550
If I could do that
and I could get away with it,

128
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:13,886
that would mean that pretty much
any athlete could do that

129
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,722
and any athlete could get away with it.

130
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:21,310
You're going to need a laboratory
to test your body fluids.

131
00:09:21,393 --> 00:09:24,647
I wasn't sure how I was gonna get
my samples into the lab yet.

132
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:27,233
The only labs
that test professional athletes

133
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:29,360
are WADA-accredited labs.

134
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:33,656
WADA is
the World Anti-Doping Agency.

135
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:37,827
The labs are set up
that you can't just go do this.

136
00:09:38,535 --> 00:09:42,456
Because if somebody could just send
their samples into a lab,

137
00:09:42,539 --> 00:09:45,209
then anybody could figure out how
to game the system.

138
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:48,087
And then...

139
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:52,550
This could damage my reputation
that I've worked on for years...

140
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:55,344
He just started getting worried
about his legacy.

141
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:58,222
My involvement...
it's just not gonna work.

142
00:09:58,514 --> 00:09:59,849
He backed out.

143
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:02,769
But, you know, God bless Don Catlin,

144
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:05,813
because he told me
that he knew this guy...

145
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:11,736
The director of the Olympic lab
in Moscow, Grigory Rodchenkov.

146
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:13,696
He's a great old friend.

147
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:17,408
We talk a few times.
He's in Moscow.

148
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:22,246
And that set off
this whole chain of events.

149
00:10:33,382 --> 00:10:34,822
Tell something.

150
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:36,052
Hi.

151
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:37,386
Oh! Great.

152
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,847
- It's a secret window. Now it's clean.
- Hmm.

153
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:41,683
Yeah, you look good now.

154
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:43,810
Yes, you, too. Go ahead.

155
00:10:45,227 --> 00:10:50,232
I met with this guy who's gonna at least,
like, prescribe me the protocol.

156
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:53,945
What is your ultimate purpose?
You would like to beat doping test?

157
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:56,197
You would like to start
your hormonal program?

158
00:10:56,280 --> 00:11:00,618
- Yes.
- Then give sample... and prove negative.

159
00:11:00,702 --> 00:11:01,703
Yes.

160
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:03,120
Ha, ha, ha.

161
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:07,374
You need a very serious advisor
because there are a lot of traps.

162
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:10,044
Normally drug... Okay.

163
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:13,130
My dog is playing.

164
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:16,342
I just came back,
and he's very much excited.

165
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:18,219
And he has a special toy...

166
00:11:18,302 --> 00:11:19,804
Yeah, I hear it.

167
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:21,848
Hey, you wanna see my dog?

168
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:24,058
- Let me get him.
- Yes.

169
00:11:25,976 --> 00:11:27,853
Oh!

170
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:29,563
Is it male, female?

171
00:11:29,646 --> 00:11:30,647
Male.

172
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:33,025
Castrated?

173
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:34,318
No.

174
00:11:34,401 --> 00:11:35,903
So with balls?

175
00:11:35,987 --> 00:11:37,238
He's got the balls.

176
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:40,532
Yeah. There is the balls. Yes, yes.

177
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:44,537
- Yeah, this is Max.
- Max.

178
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:45,913
Max. Yeah.

179
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:49,500
Testosterone,
you have to have a prescription.

180
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:51,669
Yes, uh, injectable.

181
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:52,753
Injectable, right.

182
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:54,922
So, now you are clever, huh?

183
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:56,716
Like Lance Armstrong.

184
00:11:57,299 --> 00:11:58,675
Send it to me.

185
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,303
Names, doses, for how long...

186
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:03,305
So everything should be orchestrated.

187
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:06,809
How do I do that?
Just send you everything I'm gonna take?

188
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:09,812
Yes, your one-month schedule.
Yes.

189
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:14,441
We've got three medications
that you'll take by injection.

190
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:18,279
- This is five times a week?
- Yeah, it's all on your regimen sheet.

191
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:21,032
We'll draw up half a cc.

192
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:23,200
- Looks like a big needle.
- It's a tiny needle.

193
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:24,285
- Really?
- Yeah.

194
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:29,206
Your testosterone comes ready to go.
This is very, very viscous.

195
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:33,878
It's a very thick substance,
so you need a big needle to draw it up.

196
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:36,964
Then we're gonna pull out.

197
00:12:37,756 --> 00:12:39,716
So there's your .2 CC's.

198
00:12:39,801 --> 00:12:42,719
And that one goes also in the top
of your thigh.

199
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:46,974
- I'm a little nervous, but all right.
- Okay.

200
00:12:47,058 --> 00:12:48,600
Give me a thigh.

201
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:50,519
And does it hurt the muscle?
Do you flex?

202
00:12:50,602 --> 00:12:53,314
It's not gonna go in your muscle.
It's gonna go above.

203
00:12:53,397 --> 00:12:57,026
You just pinch it, and we're just gonna go
just through the skin.

204
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:58,194
That's it.

205
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:00,863
And then we're just gonna put that
underneath the skin.

206
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:02,907
- Did that hurt?
- No, not too bad.

207
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:06,077
- I mean, I see it there.
- It'll go away in no time.

208
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,995
- That's the HCG.
- Oh, shit.

209
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:10,706
And right next to it,
the testosterone.

210
00:13:10,789 --> 00:13:13,417
Pop it through the skin.
That's all we're looking to do.

211
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,711
Just through the skin.
It's real thick now.

212
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:19,590
- And you are pumped up.
- Whoa!

213
00:13:19,673 --> 00:13:21,258
How long till those bumps go down?

214
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:23,635
- They'll go quick. Within a half hour.
- Okay. Whoa.

215
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:25,179
And so we begin.

216
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:32,519
The ability to go day after day
will be brand new for you, I think.

217
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:35,564
Going to do an injection.

218
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:37,690
Exciting.

219
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:42,071
I work with one trainer
that does a lot of fitness

220
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:43,990
as well as nutrition coaching.

221
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:45,713
Almost there. Come on, Bryan.

222
00:13:45,782 --> 00:13:48,995
We should be able to see
a 15 to 20% improvement.

223
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:52,915
What's your dog's name again?

224
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:54,708
Vrangei.

225
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:57,586
Okay. Did you start your program?

226
00:13:57,669 --> 00:13:59,005
I did.

227
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:01,632
This is my morning pill-popping routine.

228
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:06,888
And then I prepare the testosterone.

229
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:10,307
Yes, testosterone propionate.

230
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:11,433
Yes.

231
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:14,395
It's really thick.

232
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:18,774
What made you think
that Grigory might help me?

233
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:23,112
Well, it's difficult for me
to answer that without...

234
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:28,367
saying things about Grigory
that aren't very kind.

235
00:14:29,826 --> 00:14:32,246
Okay, let me think.

236
00:14:34,706 --> 00:14:37,209
So, you've already did it for two weeks?

237
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:39,044
He's fucking me.

238
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:41,797
He's fucking me.

239
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:46,093
Just pee
and collect your urine today.

240
00:14:46,177 --> 00:14:47,844
And drop into the freezer.

241
00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:51,974
So just pee, take some urine
and put it in the freezer?

242
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:53,058
In the freezer.

243
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:56,938
There's day eight, day ten...

244
00:14:57,771 --> 00:14:58,771
Needle.

245
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:05,446
The testosterone with the HGH,

246
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:08,991
it's a weird feeling because
it doesn't feel like I'm on anything.

247
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:12,369
Are you now training?
And you feel a little bit stronger?

248
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:14,788
Yeah, I really felt stronger.

249
00:15:14,871 --> 00:15:16,165
That's good.

250
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:20,252
Forty milligrams each other day
is a very good protocol.

251
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:25,049
I still had no idea
why a WADA lab director

252
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:27,259
who did all the testing
for the Sochi Olympics

253
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:29,678
would agree to do this,

254
00:15:29,761 --> 00:15:34,766
because his job was supposed to be
to catch athletes.

255
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:38,645
So you want me to do 24,000 units
in one month?

256
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:39,605
Yes.

257
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:42,024
Fuck, man. That's a lot of EPO.

258
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:45,777
You have just common fears,
and it's paranoia.

259
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:50,282
We are imitating... We are reproducing
Lance Armstrong's scenario.

260
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:54,620
I'm getting kind of bruises
all over my legs.

261
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:57,664
Don't disturb your thigh at all.
Stop it.

262
00:15:57,748 --> 00:16:02,003
You can inject into your thigh muscle,
but better to the ass.

263
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:04,171
Into my ass?

264
00:16:04,255 --> 00:16:05,256
Much more!

265
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:06,340
Okay.

266
00:16:07,008 --> 00:16:09,093
This is starting to get ridiculous.

267
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:10,677
Ow!

268
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:13,847
- Wow! I'm bleeding from that.
- Okay.

269
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:17,268
Oh, fuck, I'm really bleeding
from that one, too.

270
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:19,228
Let me get some alcohol.

271
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:23,524
Um, okay, so then a half of this one.

272
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:31,032
Oh, fuck!

273
00:16:34,451 --> 00:16:37,246
Um...

274
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:41,583
Okay.

275
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:44,753
So, that's that.

276
00:16:47,297 --> 00:16:50,175
He was like,
"You don't do subcutaneous.

277
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:52,302
You put it right into your ass.

278
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:55,305
No, we go one inch into buttocks.

279
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:57,349
Show me that bottle again."

280
00:16:57,974 --> 00:16:59,226
You're kidding me.

281
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:02,980
Have you seen movie with me?

282
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,773
- No.
- Separate movie.

283
00:17:04,856 --> 00:17:06,650
- Which movie?
- No?

284
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:08,443
About me.

285
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,115
All athletes in Russia are doping.

286
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,121
The athletes that are
under Mr. Rodchenkov,

287
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:20,831
they don't get positive tests.

288
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:28,755
The laboratory was
internationally recognized for research.

289
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:31,120
Its head scientist is considered
an outstanding scientist.

290
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:32,718
Grigory Rodchenkov.

291
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:36,888
Dr. Rodchenkov
is informed about everything.

292
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:41,060
He knows how long the drugs need
to disappear from the body.

293
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:44,438
He is aware and instructs.
He's the most important specialist.

294
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:49,651
The ARD documentary
regarding the Russian whistle-blowers...

295
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:53,655
what did you think,
hearing these allegations?

296
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:57,409
It was inflammatory enough
that they were afraid to run it

297
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:00,496
while the whistle-blowers were still
in Russia.

298
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:04,291
So they got them out of Russia,
ran the program,

299
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:06,502
and it was a bombshell.

300
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:10,631
99% of Russian athletes
are guilty of doping.

301
00:18:10,714 --> 00:18:14,551
That's according to a recent
German documentary aired on ARD.

302
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:18,347
WADA's president,
Craig Reedie, promised an investigation,

303
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:19,890
effective immediately.

304
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:22,684
It is wrong just to make
any kind of assumption

305
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:24,561
on allegations in the media.

306
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:28,690
Athletes must be presumed
to be innocent until proven guilty.

307
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:32,944
These are wild allegations,
and we'll have to check them out.

308
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:35,580
Reedie had to do something.

309
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:38,950
That's how the Independent Commission
was created.

310
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:44,290
I had investigative experience
for a decade and a half,

311
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:46,792
and some big investigations,

312
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:50,171
like US Olympic Committees
and Major League Baseball.

313
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:54,258
And Bonds hits one high!
It's a ding!

314
00:18:55,801 --> 00:19:00,347
Our mandate was athletics,
track and field and Russia.

315
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:03,976
The WADA chairman
named this Independent Commission

316
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:06,770
and said, "Let's get at it."

317
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:10,774
The Anti-Doping Agency
wants a report by the end of the year,

318
00:19:10,857 --> 00:19:13,277
and athletics officials say
they'll cooperate.

319
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,779
It's unclear, though,
what actions might be taken.

320
00:19:15,862 --> 00:19:17,156
Thomas Daigle, CBC News.

321
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:19,408
Is it gonna be okay?
Is it gonna pass over?

322
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:20,617
Is this gonna cause you...

323
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:22,453
No, no, no. It's growing.

324
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:23,537
It's growing?

325
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:25,164
It's like a tornado coming.

326
00:19:27,082 --> 00:19:30,211
Okay, so you are receiving how many units?

327
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:35,591
Grigory, the Moscow scientist
I was showing you,

328
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:37,050
who did all the testing for Sochi,

329
00:19:37,133 --> 00:19:41,305
who's now at the center
of this big Russian doping scandal.

330
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:43,724
Russia was doping their athletes
in the '80s.

331
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:47,018
- Apparently, they've never stopped.
- Really?

332
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:49,396
The crazy thing is, Richard Pound,

333
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:52,899
the guy who was the head of WADA
for 15 years,

334
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:58,029
has actually been hired
to lead the investigation against Grigory.

335
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:01,825
Um... I don't know
what you want me to do with that.

336
00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:03,702
Meaning?

337
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:07,038
I don't know how...
Shit. My computer's about to die.

338
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:09,040
I don't know how...

339
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:13,712
- Let me grab my power cord. I'll be back.
- Do you have a charger? All right.

340
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:20,302
There might be someone else out there
that might be a better decision or choice.

341
00:20:20,386 --> 00:20:23,930
You're using this guy as your coach.
What's your comfort level?

342
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:27,351
- Here's how I'm looking at it...
- You can find someone else.

343
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:32,481
I guess you call it "doping doctors."
I don't know what you would label Grigory.

344
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:34,691
Is he a biochemist? I don't even know.

345
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:38,153
It doesn't even matter.
I don't like this shit.

346
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:41,990
Look,
there's no finding someone else.

347
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,795
Your numbers look great.

348
00:20:54,878 --> 00:20:57,839
Your testosterone is pretty much
right where we want you.

349
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:02,553
Grigory, what's the typical wash-out
for urine to go to negative

350
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:04,763
from a full treatment of testosterone?

351
00:21:04,846 --> 00:21:07,015
How many days does that take usually?
Seven?

352
00:21:07,098 --> 00:21:10,101
For Bryan,
two weeks will be nice.

353
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:12,938
Is there any way that we could test
that here in the States,

354
00:21:13,021 --> 00:21:16,107
or it's gotta go back to you
to test those frozen urines?

355
00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:19,778
It's the only way.
But again, I am under heavy control.

356
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:23,865
WADA now, they have an inquiry about me.

357
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:24,866
Yes.

358
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:28,329
So you see, like, me...
I'm a very dangerous person.

359
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:33,375
How do you think is the best way
to basically get that test done?

360
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:35,502
Maybe, hopefully...

361
00:21:35,586 --> 00:21:38,714
I would like to do this,
to come to, maybe, LA,

362
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:42,301
and to smuggle something to Russia.
Some urines from you.

363
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:44,928
Um...

364
00:21:45,011 --> 00:21:48,307
Could we send 'em to Salt Lake City
or another lab?

365
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:50,559
No, no, no. It's strictly prohibited.

366
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:03,822
You are so skinny!

367
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:05,824
You're skinny.

368
00:22:05,907 --> 00:22:06,907
No!

369
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:11,163
All the urine in my freezer,
we have to unfreeze it?

370
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:13,665
Yes, we unfreeze,
then we homogenize

371
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:15,751
to make sure everything is melted.

372
00:22:16,377 --> 00:22:20,339
I took special bottles
for smuggling urine, and...

373
00:22:21,047 --> 00:22:24,175
we will make a scenario
like I am collecting my urine.

374
00:22:24,259 --> 00:22:26,344
"Grigory one, morning."

375
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:28,847
"Evening, 28th. Grigory two."

376
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:31,057
Then we recode them.

377
00:22:32,267 --> 00:22:33,268
Perfect.

378
00:22:33,351 --> 00:22:35,437
Otherwise, what is the source
of the urine and why?

379
00:22:35,521 --> 00:22:36,522
Right.

380
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:38,524
The goal during
this two-to three-week period

381
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:42,235
is to push you to an extreme
on a chronic level, not just acute.

382
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:44,613
- Okay, we...
- Max!

383
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:46,156
He loves me.

384
00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:47,365
Yeah. Max...

385
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:49,242
No, no, don't kick Max. It's okay.

386
00:22:49,325 --> 00:22:52,287
- Max, go away. Out.
- No, no, no.

387
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:54,915
It's not good time.

388
00:22:54,998 --> 00:22:56,875
Later.

389
00:23:00,587 --> 00:23:04,925
A fifteen-second acceleration
whenever you want. Good.

390
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,386
We need girls, cheerleaders.

391
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:12,766
Right? Exactly.
Maybe we should get you some pom-poms.

392
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:14,851
- And like this...
- Right.

393
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:20,607
I was working here in 1989,
when Catlin was in big power.

394
00:23:20,691 --> 00:23:24,027
Laboratory was located in UCLA.
The campus.

395
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:28,615
Twenty years ago,
we had decided to develop a way to get

396
00:23:28,699 --> 00:23:32,410
actually friendly
with what was then the Soviets.

397
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:36,873
We, the US,
would invite Soviets to come to the US

398
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:40,251
and pick and choose athletes
that they wanted to test,

399
00:23:40,335 --> 00:23:44,297
bring 'em in and test them
where the Soviets were watching.

400
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:48,093
Grigory was the first representative.

401
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:53,432
He shows up at the second day of work
in bright orange shorts

402
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:58,812
and announces that he's gonna enter
the Santa Monica Marathon.

403
00:23:58,895 --> 00:24:00,897
And he won the darn thing.

404
00:24:02,023 --> 00:24:03,358
He's a good athlete.

405
00:24:04,651 --> 00:24:07,403
I was almost
a professional in running.

406
00:24:07,488 --> 00:24:11,533
1,500 meters and five kilometers
at Moscow University.

407
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:15,954
My mother always pushed me
to swim, to ski.

408
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:20,000
I realized that some people
are using something.

409
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:24,004
Last year, he was nobody.
Next year, he has muscles.

410
00:24:24,671 --> 00:24:27,883
Of course, I also started
to use the best of the best,

411
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:29,468
stanozolol.

412
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:33,346
And all injections were done by my mother.

413
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:37,267
And, of course, it was 50 milligrams,
this simple thing.

414
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:40,228
Wait, wait.
Your mother injected you?

415
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:42,021
Yes, of course.

416
00:24:44,065 --> 00:24:47,736
But if you are not national team level,
like Olympic,

417
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:50,614
you cannot afford any more training camp.

418
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:55,327
So, I graduated to Moscow University,
to the chemical department.

419
00:24:56,411 --> 00:24:59,080
I liked doping control. I liked sports.

420
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:04,377
And since 1985, I worked in the top field
of laboratories in the world.

421
00:25:06,212 --> 00:25:09,424
And then, Moscow laboratory
was doing mistake by mistake.

422
00:25:09,507 --> 00:25:12,803
"We need a new director,
and it will be upheld by WADA."

423
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:15,806
That's how I became director.

424
00:25:22,395 --> 00:25:25,231
Should I be taking the HGH
and the testosterone now?

425
00:25:25,315 --> 00:25:26,955
Let's look at your protocol.

426
00:25:27,568 --> 00:25:30,946
I have to sketch all schematics,
starting from the new year.

427
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:32,829
- We'll sit down with a piece of paper.
- Yes.

428
00:25:32,906 --> 00:25:35,491
With the piss and then with the tubes.

429
00:25:36,117 --> 00:25:37,869
We take just a fraction.

430
00:25:38,369 --> 00:25:41,289
And then it will be coded
and took for analysis.

431
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:45,001
So, here's day one. Okay?
Here's day two.

432
00:25:46,002 --> 00:25:48,463
Here's day three, day four, day five.

433
00:25:48,546 --> 00:25:50,465
Seven, eight, nine.

434
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:53,802
We have nine urines. Okay.

435
00:25:54,302 --> 00:25:56,763
- So we are starting...
- And that one, I just took.

436
00:25:56,847 --> 00:25:58,974
Is that enough? Or do I need any more?

437
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:00,058
It's okay.

438
00:26:00,141 --> 00:26:01,142
Okay.

439
00:26:01,768 --> 00:26:04,646
- Three, three, three.
- I hear you got the real code.

440
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:05,856
I am mafia.

441
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:08,233
This is mafia.

442
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:13,697
Chased by WADA.

443
00:26:15,406 --> 00:26:19,535
Could you imagine, the best laboratory
will be puzzled with your piss?

444
00:26:20,328 --> 00:26:22,789
In Russia, the empire of evil.

445
00:26:23,456 --> 00:26:24,457
Propaganda.

446
00:26:27,377 --> 00:26:29,379
- Fantastic.
- Oh, God. What is that?

447
00:26:29,462 --> 00:26:31,006
It's flakes. Your flakes.

448
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:33,466
What is that? What is that?

449
00:26:34,175 --> 00:26:35,594
Your sins.

450
00:26:45,395 --> 00:26:46,730
And on the top.

451
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:06,917
When I come to Moscow
in September, after the race, I can drink.

452
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,920
Okay, next time. Next time, if I survive.

453
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:21,348
At my lab, WADA is keeping laboratory
on a very short leash. Leash?

454
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:23,266
Asking many questions.

455
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:25,560
All sort of bullshit.

456
00:27:26,602 --> 00:27:28,354
Like, "Where is your...

457
00:27:29,647 --> 00:27:32,984
underground laboratory for pre-testing?

458
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:36,154
Where is the shadow laboratory?"

459
00:27:37,572 --> 00:27:40,867
Of course, my laboratory is fully under...

460
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:45,121
cameras and everything,
computers, barcodes...

461
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,666
But they were looking for something.

462
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:50,794
- Like a secret lab?
- Yes, yes, yes, yes, underground.

463
00:27:50,877 --> 00:27:52,963
- Batman?
- Yes, yes.

464
00:27:53,671 --> 00:27:55,673
Who owns the lab?

465
00:27:57,175 --> 00:27:58,509
- The state.
- The state does?

466
00:27:58,593 --> 00:27:59,594
Yes.

467
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:02,222
Okay, we have Terminal One,
departing flight.

468
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:06,101
- Yeah.
- ♪ I am a woman in love ♪

469
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:13,066
Keep it. It's my donation.

470
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:15,276
- No, no, no!
- No, no, no.

471
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,486
I have a lot, you see.

472
00:28:16,569 --> 00:28:20,490
All people are presenting me with pens,
so I have full collection.

473
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:22,826
- Remember me.
- I will.

474
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:26,079
- So I'm gonna see you...
- So, so, so nice with you.

475
00:28:26,162 --> 00:28:27,748
- Grigory, thanks for coming.
- Yes.

476
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:30,083
Be very careful
with what you are recording.

477
00:28:30,166 --> 00:28:33,378
It's not permitted.
It's like pornography and erotics.

478
00:28:34,295 --> 00:28:35,797
Sports pornography and erotics.

479
00:28:35,881 --> 00:28:38,216
Now we are...

480
00:28:38,299 --> 00:28:40,343
And I see you, uh, in September.

481
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:42,262
Yes, definitely.

482
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:48,935
Did you go to Moscow?

483
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:51,354
No, I did not, and Dick Pound did not.

484
00:28:51,938 --> 00:28:57,485
We wanted to send an investigative group
of WADA specialists into the Moscow lab.

485
00:28:58,111 --> 00:29:01,740
The director of the lab,
he was the last fail-safe position, right?

486
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:04,034
If there is a sample
that's potentially positive,

487
00:29:04,117 --> 00:29:06,077
where can you stop it from being reported?

488
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:07,161
In the lab.

489
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:11,249
So he was interviewed.
Didn't provide us with much information.

490
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:16,504
Please tell me all my frozen piss
didn't explode in your bag.

491
00:29:18,589 --> 00:29:20,258
But this is big secret.

492
00:29:20,926 --> 00:29:23,094
Bryan, I have all urines.

493
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:25,596
We analyzed urines
for your steroid profile.

494
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,723
Everything is kept frozen.

495
00:29:27,808 --> 00:29:31,311
- I have a full agenda, so don't worry.
- Okay.

496
00:29:35,148 --> 00:29:38,443
We did preliminary tests,
but not much.

497
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:40,904
When WADA will leave...

498
00:29:40,987 --> 00:29:43,073
They are leaving tomorrow night.

499
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:45,992
Then maybe Friday,
or maybe Monday, anyway...

500
00:29:46,076 --> 00:29:48,203
WADA's there bothering you?

501
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:49,913
It's much more challenging.

502
00:29:49,996 --> 00:29:52,999
WADA is sniffing
and asking tons of questions.

503
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:55,627
- Dick Pound... You know, Dick Pound?
- Yes

504
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:59,630
He's starting to understand
it's very difficult to prove something.

505
00:29:59,714 --> 00:30:02,633
What do you see the outcome
or the solution as?

506
00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:04,427
We will see.

507
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:06,972
You just focus on racing.

508
00:30:13,603 --> 00:30:15,981
Keep digging, keep digging.
Keep digging, come on.

509
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:18,900
Come on, you got it.
Come on. Four, two, one.

510
00:30:18,984 --> 00:30:20,318
Taking it down. Taking it down.

511
00:30:21,652 --> 00:30:23,613
This is already better than last time.

512
00:30:25,866 --> 00:30:31,037
Last year, 250 watts. This year, 349.
It's 100 watts.

513
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:36,376
My power right now is 20% more
than I had last year.

514
00:30:36,459 --> 00:30:40,505
Yes, yes, finally you have some gains.
Some gain, some progression.

515
00:30:40,588 --> 00:30:42,340
I can't wait to come to Moscow.

516
00:30:42,423 --> 00:30:44,384
Bryan, it will be fantastic.

517
00:30:45,635 --> 00:30:48,888
I shouldn't bring any EPO with me
to Europe, right?

518
00:30:48,972 --> 00:30:50,292
- No.
- Okay.

519
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:53,101
You complete everything
until 17th.

520
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:55,895
- The last injection is on US soil.
- Okay.

521
00:30:55,979 --> 00:30:58,231
Before passing the border
and the customs.

522
00:30:58,314 --> 00:31:00,566
Then you're taking urine with you to me,

523
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:02,903
and we'll complete
your biological passport.

524
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:04,737
That's it.

525
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:10,076
Words cannot describe
what you'll be living through this week.

526
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:13,288
Your body's gonna shut down.
It's gonna break down entirely.

527
00:31:15,331 --> 00:31:17,833
We are on
the French Cycling Federation calendar,

528
00:31:17,918 --> 00:31:20,253
and we do have an anti-doping policy.

529
00:31:20,336 --> 00:31:24,174
As far as testing for PEDs,
the race says that they do.

530
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:26,509
They may come and test,
just so you're aware.

531
00:31:26,593 --> 00:31:29,470
As I came to learn, they don't.

532
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:32,849
- Don't worry.
- But I had Grigory.

533
00:31:33,808 --> 00:31:35,435
He had helped me dope,

534
00:31:35,518 --> 00:31:40,690
and he was gonna test my samples
through his WADA lab in Moscow.

535
00:31:40,773 --> 00:31:42,483
So, be clever.

536
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:46,321
I have not done a urine sample
since I've been here.

537
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:48,489
You are like a pioneer.

538
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:51,910
So I'm gonna pee
in this little bag here.

539
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:54,162
You are a victim of your ideas.

540
00:31:55,621 --> 00:31:58,458
August 21st.

541
00:31:58,541 --> 00:32:01,753
See you at the end.
And good luck tomorrow.

542
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:04,714
Start time tomorrow morning,
7:15.

543
00:32:04,797 --> 00:32:07,008
- Right here.
- I am like a priest.

544
00:32:08,384 --> 00:32:10,595
I am healing your doping paranoia.

545
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:16,643
You are free. You have enough power,
and God is with you.

546
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:20,146
You are sentenced to win.

547
00:32:21,897 --> 00:32:25,068
So the scheme was now in place.

548
00:32:28,071 --> 00:32:29,655
Raise your arms!

549
00:32:29,739 --> 00:32:32,575
Are you ready?

550
00:32:33,701 --> 00:32:34,953
Start!

551
00:32:55,556 --> 00:32:56,932
Ninety, ninety. That's it.

552
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:09,153
Pouly!

553
00:33:17,162 --> 00:33:18,288
You did great.

554
00:33:18,371 --> 00:33:20,057
You were three and a half minutes
behind Pouly.

555
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:22,161
- That's not bad.
- No, that's fucking great.

556
00:33:22,708 --> 00:33:24,710
You guys were hauling ass.

557
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:39,309
Bryan's in that group data.
He's in there with the top ten guys.

558
00:33:40,601 --> 00:33:43,313
All the guys in the top ten
are incredible.

559
00:33:43,396 --> 00:33:44,647
Very good.

560
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:46,066
They could be pro.

561
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:49,986
You are a monster.

562
00:33:50,486 --> 00:33:52,280
Medium-sized monster.

563
00:33:58,453 --> 00:34:00,205
Bryan Fogel, can you hear me?

564
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:07,378
Can't raise him on the walkie-talkie.
Bryan, come back.

565
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,967
- Bryan!
- Yeah?

566
00:34:15,178 --> 00:34:16,512
It has to be charged.

567
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:19,974
The battery's dead.
It needed to be charged.

568
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:23,894
Now it won't go up. You see?
Dead. It's totally dead.

569
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:26,856
Fuck!

570
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:31,778
My derailleur, my shifting,
it broke.

571
00:34:32,445 --> 00:34:33,685
- Your bike?
- Yes.

572
00:34:35,698 --> 00:34:38,368
You cannot shift your gears?

573
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,703
For 100 kilometers.

574
00:34:42,538 --> 00:34:43,748
My goodness.

575
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:49,754
- I dropped ten places in the rankings.
- Okay. Hmm.

576
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:52,507
My God.

577
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:57,762
I feel
that I'm really stronger this year.

578
00:34:57,845 --> 00:35:00,265
- Like, that I'm recovering.
- Yeah.

579
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:03,058
I mean, I'm hauling ass,
but they're...

580
00:35:03,143 --> 00:35:05,603
I'm not beating 'em.
They're in a different...

581
00:35:05,686 --> 00:35:09,857
There's guys that I don't know
that you could've beat on your best day.

582
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:17,406
My whole plan was

583
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:21,119
to have a substantially
better performance this year.

584
00:35:22,412 --> 00:35:23,579
And...

585
00:35:24,955 --> 00:35:25,998
I'm not.

586
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:29,377
Did you just get separated
or what?

587
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:30,753
Neutral descent now?

588
00:35:32,046 --> 00:35:35,383
Does it hurt that you did
better last year than you did this year?

589
00:35:37,593 --> 00:35:41,013
I mean, I could have been 21 years old

590
00:35:41,096 --> 00:35:43,933
and taken all the blood bags
and EPO in the world,

591
00:35:44,016 --> 00:35:47,687
and I was still not going to be
a Tour de France champion.

592
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:49,689
It doesn't matter.

593
00:35:54,109 --> 00:35:56,279
Just stay optimistic.

594
00:35:57,530 --> 00:36:00,325
Because now, we can change nothing.

595
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:10,042
The winner, Peter Pouly.

596
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:16,632
- I felt pretty good. I just had...
- No, no, no.

597
00:36:16,716 --> 00:36:18,384
I've just had some bad luck days.

598
00:36:18,467 --> 00:36:19,760
Bryan, look at me.

599
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:22,430
Stop it.

600
00:36:23,764 --> 00:36:25,850
You are what you are. I am what I am.

601
00:36:28,644 --> 00:36:30,897
It's a turning point, what we are doing.

602
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:36,236
You should be happy
that we have such fantastic material.

603
00:36:36,819 --> 00:36:42,658
We have ten times more information
than Dick Pound and Armstrong together.

604
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:45,244
- Really?
- We will continue. Don't worry.

605
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:49,249
You are just like in the reception.
You did not enter the first floor.

606
00:36:49,332 --> 00:36:51,459
Then there is a second and so on.

607
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:54,420
What's on the second floor?

608
00:36:54,921 --> 00:36:57,131
When you go to Moscow,
you will see.

609
00:37:12,062 --> 00:37:13,606
So cool.

610
00:37:14,274 --> 00:37:17,277
How many tests...
I've probably had 15 or 20 blood tests.

611
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,445
- It's more than enough.
- Okay.

612
00:37:20,446 --> 00:37:22,531
- Is this the laboratory?
- Yes.

613
00:37:23,616 --> 00:37:26,035
Oh, you see, this is bloody RUSADA.

614
00:37:26,118 --> 00:37:30,498
Bringing samples, it's not too good
to show our camera to them.

615
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:33,251
- Oh. You want us to hide?
- Yes, yes, yes.

616
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:34,585
Okay.

617
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:36,879
Be very careful with all your material.

618
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:39,590
- People are very sensitive also, you know.
- Yes.

619
00:37:41,133 --> 00:37:43,303
This is my director place.

620
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:46,514
It's the most famous laboratory
in the world.

621
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:53,479
We cannot say explicitly
that you have been analyzed.

622
00:37:53,563 --> 00:37:56,857
It's coming.
I already solved everything yesterday.

623
00:37:56,941 --> 00:38:01,195
You will have it until, let's say...
Within two weeks, we will do this.

624
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:04,574
But it should be done still,
say, under the table, not...

625
00:38:05,074 --> 00:38:06,867
- Okay.
- Okay.

626
00:38:07,827 --> 00:38:12,290
Smile. Your race is over.
We have to go downstairs.

627
00:38:16,877 --> 00:38:18,838
Are there scientists,

628
00:38:18,921 --> 00:38:22,007
or those working
in WADA laboratories today,

629
00:38:22,091 --> 00:38:25,345
that you suspect
could have been corrupted?

630
00:38:25,428 --> 00:38:27,448
Each director of laboratory,
like me...

631
00:38:27,472 --> 00:38:29,515
I have to sign a code of ethics,

632
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:32,435
that what we are doing
is not harmful or detrimental

633
00:38:32,518 --> 00:38:34,854
to the whole anti-doping society.

634
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:42,027
We go down this emergency exit.

635
00:38:49,243 --> 00:38:51,161
What did Russia have to do

636
00:38:51,245 --> 00:38:56,041
with the hiding blood passports
of all the athletes?

637
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:58,043
Let's talk in my office.

638
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:04,967
If you hide fight against doping,
you cannot be 50% honest.

639
00:39:05,051 --> 00:39:09,013
You have to be honest,
or you have to hide the ends.

640
00:39:09,096 --> 00:39:11,807
It's the same as Orwell, 1984.

641
00:39:12,391 --> 00:39:15,102
WADA is like a religion,
and you cannot escape.

642
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:18,981
You have to think about money,
but you cannot steal money.

643
00:39:19,064 --> 00:39:21,233
You have to think about women,

644
00:39:21,316 --> 00:39:24,194
but you have to be married
and don't go to prostitution.

645
00:39:24,278 --> 00:39:25,279
But again...

646
00:39:25,988 --> 00:39:30,200
almost everybody has some period
when they were sinners.

647
00:39:30,284 --> 00:39:31,369
So what to do?

648
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:33,413
There is no answer.

649
00:39:35,330 --> 00:39:39,919
For the last five months,
I took urine and then I did blood...

650
00:39:40,002 --> 00:39:41,796
Yes, we have a good database.

651
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:47,718
How do we go about the analysis?
What do we wanna show?

652
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:51,180
How do we put together

653
00:39:51,263 --> 00:39:54,183
- the bigger story arc?
- Bryan, be optimistic.

654
00:39:54,266 --> 00:39:56,101
Smile.

655
00:39:57,937 --> 00:39:59,313
I have vodka for you.

656
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:01,482
- You do?
- Yes.

657
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:04,359
- The best vodka.
- What kind?

658
00:40:04,444 --> 00:40:05,778
From Mordovia.

659
00:40:05,861 --> 00:40:07,321
- Oh, awesome!
- You do drink vodka?

660
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:10,282
- Yeah, I like vodka.
- You like... I have vodka for you.

661
00:40:10,365 --> 00:40:14,203
I've decided I'm not gonna leave Russia.
I'm gonna stay here.

662
00:40:14,286 --> 00:40:15,663
You would like to stay?

663
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:19,709
Russia is the most relaxing country
in the world.

664
00:40:19,792 --> 00:40:20,918
You think?

665
00:40:21,001 --> 00:40:23,504
No.

666
00:40:31,596 --> 00:40:32,763
You having fun?

667
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:34,682
Yes, we have fun!

668
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:36,684
Smile.

669
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:44,692
Bryan!

670
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:19,393
Ladies and gentlemen,
members of the media, welcome to Geneva.

671
00:41:20,185 --> 00:41:23,272
Almost a year ago,
very serious doping allegations

672
00:41:23,355 --> 00:41:26,484
were first raised
on German television channel ARD.

673
00:41:27,234 --> 00:41:29,403
The WADA president, Sir Craig Reedie,

674
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:32,948
announced that a full and thorough inquiry
would be conducted.

675
00:41:33,699 --> 00:41:36,911
The founding president
of the World Anti-Doping Agency,

676
00:41:36,994 --> 00:41:39,664
Mr. Dick Pound,
the chair of that commission.

677
00:41:41,373 --> 00:41:46,921
Overwhelming portions of the allegations
made on the ARD program

678
00:41:47,004 --> 00:41:51,133
have been found
by the Independent Commission to be true.

679
00:41:51,217 --> 00:41:54,136
It's worse than we thought.
We have found cover-ups.

680
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:57,431
We found destruction
of samples in the laboratories.

681
00:41:58,348 --> 00:42:03,187
We found payments of money
in order to conceal doping tests...

682
00:42:04,271 --> 00:42:05,272
among others.

683
00:42:05,981 --> 00:42:09,735
Our conclusion was that all
of this could not have happened,

684
00:42:09,818 --> 00:42:12,404
and continue to happen,
without the knowledge of

685
00:42:12,488 --> 00:42:17,159
and either actual or implied consent
of the state authorities.

686
00:42:17,243 --> 00:42:18,494
You reading this?

687
00:42:18,994 --> 00:42:22,206
Forty pages of this report is Grigory.

688
00:42:22,998 --> 00:42:25,417
It's hard to imagine

689
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:29,964
what the Russian state interest
in athletes' urine would be.

690
00:42:30,047 --> 00:42:35,219
One of our big concerns about tests
were the 1,400 that were destroyed

691
00:42:35,302 --> 00:42:37,930
by the director of the Moscow laboratory.

692
00:42:38,597 --> 00:42:42,142
In fact, our recommendation
is the director of the laboratory

693
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:46,521
be removed from his position,
that the WADA accreditation be withdrawn,

694
00:42:46,606 --> 00:42:48,941
and the Russian Federation be suspended.

695
00:42:53,278 --> 00:42:55,114
- Bryan, hi.
- Hi.

696
00:42:57,074 --> 00:42:58,283
Where did Grigory go?

697
00:42:58,367 --> 00:42:59,534
I've been crying.

698
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:01,704
Yes, I am with him,

699
00:43:01,787 --> 00:43:04,289
and I think maybe you want
to speak with him.

700
00:43:04,373 --> 00:43:06,166
Maybe he's a little bit nervous.

701
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:09,670
- I'm so sorry.
- Bryan.

702
00:43:09,754 --> 00:43:14,049
I'm not... I'm sorry. I'm trying
to understand what you're saying.

703
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:18,428
I'm absolutely saying
that we will overturn all this bullshit,

704
00:43:18,512 --> 00:43:20,430
and it will be upside down.

705
00:43:20,514 --> 00:43:23,267
So, Bryan,
I hardly could talk to you tonight.

706
00:43:25,394 --> 00:43:26,687
The details are damning

707
00:43:26,771 --> 00:43:29,899
and could have a profound impact
on the future of Russian athletics.

708
00:43:29,982 --> 00:43:32,902
This WADA commission
has accused Russian athletics

709
00:43:32,985 --> 00:43:35,279
of state-sponsored doping.

710
00:43:39,408 --> 00:43:45,289
We are preparing our response
to again provide any explanation needed.

711
00:43:45,372 --> 00:43:48,042
That's all I can say at this point.

712
00:43:48,709 --> 00:43:52,379
Does this mean they could potentially miss
next year's Olympics?

713
00:43:52,462 --> 00:43:55,174
Well, that is certainly
one of the potential outcomes here.

714
00:43:55,257 --> 00:43:58,803
The International Olympic Committee
have released a statement.

715
00:43:58,886 --> 00:44:03,015
You will see athletes
being sanctioned by the IAAF.

716
00:44:03,098 --> 00:44:07,477
You will see athletes
and officials being excluded.

717
00:44:07,561 --> 00:44:11,816
And you will see an action led by the IOC.

718
00:44:11,899 --> 00:44:14,902
We'll apply this zero-tolerance policy.

719
00:44:15,569 --> 00:44:18,030
Decision time for the IAAF

720
00:44:18,113 --> 00:44:20,407
on whether Russia's
track and field athletes

721
00:44:20,490 --> 00:44:23,327
will be allowed
to compete at the Rio Olympics.

722
00:44:23,828 --> 00:44:27,081
I want to hear
what the Athletics Federation of Russia

723
00:44:27,164 --> 00:44:29,583
is actually saying
in answer to those allegations.

724
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:32,753
The Sports Minister,
Vitaly Mutko, has said,

725
00:44:32,837 --> 00:44:36,924
"Russia took all the necessary measures,"
he says, "to fight the doping problem.

726
00:44:37,007 --> 00:44:38,759
Moscow's anti-doping lab

727
00:44:38,843 --> 00:44:41,887
was recently recognized
as one of the best in the world."

728
00:44:44,598 --> 00:44:46,141
You don't want to talk to us?

729
00:44:46,225 --> 00:44:50,771
Well, the employees at this lab
are clearly being very tight-lipped,

730
00:44:50,855 --> 00:44:54,608
but the report
from the World Anti-Doping Agency

731
00:44:54,691 --> 00:44:56,235
goes into great detail

732
00:44:56,318 --> 00:44:59,654
describing the alleged activities
inside that building.

733
00:45:00,865 --> 00:45:02,867
There are around
50 correspondents

734
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:05,786
behind my fence, but I am here.

735
00:45:05,870 --> 00:45:07,662
And I am not supposed to talk.

736
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:10,415
Bryan, stay quiet.

737
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:14,754
You're a lucky man.
Only you, knowing me.

738
00:45:17,547 --> 00:45:18,799
Holy shit.

739
00:45:20,008 --> 00:45:26,557
The World Anti-Doping Agency suspended
Russia's sports drug-testing lab,

740
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,725
and the head of the lab resigned.

741
00:45:35,274 --> 00:45:37,943
Grisha,
be careful what you tell him now.

742
00:45:38,027 --> 00:45:40,029
Don't tell me. I am just...

743
00:45:40,112 --> 00:45:42,197
They're holding
on the phone for you.

744
00:45:42,281 --> 00:45:45,201
- Tell them I'll call back...
- It sounds serious.

745
00:45:45,284 --> 00:45:47,119
I'll call back in five minutes!

746
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:51,123
- Okay, but will you?
- Yes, go away!

747
00:45:51,832 --> 00:45:52,833
Fine.

748
00:45:53,333 --> 00:45:54,376
Bryan...

749
00:45:55,419 --> 00:45:56,921
It's a disaster.

750
00:45:57,004 --> 00:45:58,505
They're just killing people.

751
00:45:58,588 --> 00:46:01,383
Cutting heads, you know,
without who is guilty.

752
00:46:01,466 --> 00:46:04,219
Yesterday, you know,
I went to Minister Mutko,

753
00:46:04,303 --> 00:46:06,138
and we started to discuss.

754
00:46:06,221 --> 00:46:09,349
He was talking,
blah, blah, blah, about football.

755
00:46:09,433 --> 00:46:12,269
Uh, blah, blah, blah, about Formula 1.

756
00:46:13,187 --> 00:46:15,815
Then to say what to do with bloody doping.

757
00:46:15,898 --> 00:46:18,901
But he say, "Could you resign?"
I go, "Yes."

758
00:46:19,776 --> 00:46:22,321
"Today?" "Yes, today."

759
00:46:23,113 --> 00:46:24,198
And I resigned.

760
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:26,241
And...

761
00:46:27,076 --> 00:46:28,618
they lost director.

762
00:46:28,702 --> 00:46:31,830
I have a lot of calls,
but I'm just changing my telephones.

763
00:46:31,914 --> 00:46:37,294
People are looking for their job,
but laboratory is almost empty.

764
00:46:37,377 --> 00:46:38,377
Empty.

765
00:46:38,838 --> 00:46:41,173
I don't know what's going on.

766
00:46:41,256 --> 00:46:44,510
I just know what I'm reading
in the newspaper and in the press and...

767
00:46:44,593 --> 00:46:45,719
You know.

768
00:46:45,802 --> 00:46:47,179
Oh, really? Really?

769
00:46:47,888 --> 00:46:50,807
I mean, will they come after you?

770
00:46:50,891 --> 00:46:53,185
Are they gonna arrest you?
Are they gonna...

771
00:46:53,685 --> 00:46:55,770
Would they try to put you in jail?

772
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:57,898
In jail? No.

773
00:46:57,982 --> 00:46:59,566
What is the reason for jail?

774
00:46:59,649 --> 00:47:00,567
- You know.
- No.

775
00:47:00,650 --> 00:47:02,527
Are you in any danger?

776
00:47:04,363 --> 00:47:08,242
Yes, but not jail.
It could be some... I don't know.

777
00:47:10,202 --> 00:47:12,371
- I mean...
- Do you know that I am now moving

778
00:47:12,454 --> 00:47:13,914
with a security man?

779
00:47:13,998 --> 00:47:15,249
Security guard.

780
00:47:15,332 --> 00:47:16,332
No.

781
00:47:16,833 --> 00:47:19,003
Just a security guard in my home.

782
00:47:19,086 --> 00:47:20,921
- In your home?
- Coming to my car.

783
00:47:21,005 --> 00:47:22,297
I'm following behind.

784
00:47:23,257 --> 00:47:25,634
It's recommended
until the end of the week,

785
00:47:25,717 --> 00:47:28,470
because I am the only man
who can kill both sides.

786
00:47:28,553 --> 00:47:29,930
Russia and WADA, so...

787
00:47:30,014 --> 00:47:31,765
Stay quiet.

788
00:47:33,225 --> 00:47:34,905
Let me say this.

789
00:47:34,977 --> 00:47:39,023
In reality,
the Independent Commission's report

790
00:47:39,106 --> 00:47:42,943
and statements made by Mr. Pound
are exaggerated.

791
00:47:43,027 --> 00:47:46,196
We've even built a modern,
state-of-the-art anti-doping laboratory

792
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:49,616
that is renowned for its testing

793
00:47:49,699 --> 00:47:54,746
for the Olympics, Paralympics,
championships and more,

794
00:47:54,829 --> 00:47:57,666
and received the highest merits
for its contributions.

795
00:47:57,749 --> 00:48:00,460
The government is merely financing
the laboratory operation.

796
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:03,672
They don't accept
this Independent Commission at all.

797
00:48:05,007 --> 00:48:06,550
They're deliberately lying.

798
00:48:07,384 --> 00:48:08,510
Bryan, Bryan...

799
00:48:09,177 --> 00:48:10,637
- look at me.
- Okay.

800
00:48:11,388 --> 00:48:15,142
It means I could be tossed
under the bus anytime.

801
00:48:15,935 --> 00:48:18,895
I'm not sure
that we are connecting freely.

802
00:48:18,979 --> 00:48:21,773
Because now we are on radar,
that's for sure.

803
00:48:23,358 --> 00:48:24,401
You know Snowden?

804
00:48:25,069 --> 00:48:26,111
Yeah, of course.

805
00:48:26,861 --> 00:48:29,364
Now you see.

806
00:48:30,532 --> 00:48:32,742
We still don't know...
We still don't know

807
00:48:32,826 --> 00:48:36,080
whether Russia is participating
in Olympic Games or not.

808
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:41,084
The outcome, why I am very much
cautious about my life...

809
00:48:41,918 --> 00:48:45,547
If me will be purged...

810
00:48:46,256 --> 00:48:48,175
okay, Russia will go to the Olympics.

811
00:48:48,717 --> 00:48:51,511
The problem is to survive.

812
00:48:51,595 --> 00:48:53,347
- Listen, I, uh...
- Yes.

813
00:48:53,973 --> 00:48:56,558
- Joking, you know, seriousness aside...
- Stop it. Stop, stop.

814
00:48:56,641 --> 00:48:59,811
I'm just... I'm worried about you.

815
00:49:00,479 --> 00:49:01,605
Yes, yes.

816
00:49:02,231 --> 00:49:03,565
Tomorrow, I drop you.

817
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:07,319
And then, when I say...

818
00:49:07,694 --> 00:49:12,616
"How is weather in Los Angeles?"
or anything related to weather...

819
00:49:14,826 --> 00:49:18,038
it means that we will talk
in 15, 20 minutes.

820
00:49:18,122 --> 00:49:19,123
Be ready to talk.

821
00:49:23,335 --> 00:49:26,713
Tonight, our sport
finds itself in a shameful situation.

822
00:49:26,796 --> 00:49:31,926
And that is why I can confirm
the council has overwhelmingly voted,

823
00:49:32,011 --> 00:49:35,389
with immediate effect,
to suspend the Russian Federation.

824
00:49:35,472 --> 00:49:39,476
It's done so, uh, by 22 votes to one.

825
00:49:39,559 --> 00:49:43,522
It is the strongest sanction...

826
00:49:52,906 --> 00:49:57,452
Regarding the recent events

827
00:49:58,870 --> 00:50:01,540
connected to our track and field team,

828
00:50:01,623 --> 00:50:06,628
I urge the sports minister
and all my sports colleagues

829
00:50:06,711 --> 00:50:09,173
to make this their number one priority.

830
00:50:09,256 --> 00:50:10,424
This is the first step.

831
00:50:10,507 --> 00:50:14,678
Secondly, it is vital to conduct
our own internal investigation.

832
00:50:14,761 --> 00:50:18,432
Sport should be fair.

833
00:50:18,515 --> 00:50:23,395
Responsibility should be personalized
and absolute.

834
00:50:27,816 --> 00:50:28,817
Bryan...

835
00:50:30,485 --> 00:50:32,571
I need... Wait, look at me.

836
00:50:32,654 --> 00:50:33,738
Yeah.

837
00:50:33,822 --> 00:50:37,159
I need to escape and to walk... to walk...

838
00:50:37,242 --> 00:50:38,868
You can go wherever you want.

839
00:50:38,952 --> 00:50:42,831
- Okay.
- I will be doggy-sitting at your home.

840
00:50:42,914 --> 00:50:44,583
So you wanna get out?

841
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:47,043
Yes. Simply.

842
00:50:48,002 --> 00:50:50,547
What do you want to, uh...

843
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:53,175
It's very suspicious when you have
one-way ticket, you know.

844
00:50:53,258 --> 00:50:57,096
Yeah, right.
You have to book a round trip.

845
00:50:57,179 --> 00:50:58,859
They're watching us.

846
00:50:59,973 --> 00:51:01,141
- Bryan?
- Yeah.

847
00:51:01,225 --> 00:51:04,311
What I am doing,
myself, I can do nothing.

848
00:51:04,394 --> 00:51:06,188
- So...
- Okay?

849
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:11,235
I'll send you... Let me figure out
some flight options, okay?

850
00:51:12,527 --> 00:51:13,527
Okay.

851
00:51:14,779 --> 00:51:16,615
I'm gonna get the flight,
right now.

852
00:51:16,698 --> 00:51:18,575
- Yes, right now.
- Okay.

853
00:51:18,658 --> 00:51:19,784
Go.

854
00:51:19,868 --> 00:51:23,122
Also, some security measures will be set.

855
00:51:23,205 --> 00:51:26,250
How will I know
that you made it through okay?

856
00:51:26,333 --> 00:51:27,333
Um...

857
00:51:28,710 --> 00:51:30,086
I don't know.

858
00:51:31,213 --> 00:51:32,214
Okay?

859
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:34,341
Okay.

860
00:51:35,842 --> 00:51:36,843
Okay.

861
00:51:39,053 --> 00:51:41,097
- Bryan?
- Yeah, I'm right here.

862
00:51:41,181 --> 00:51:44,226
- Okay, just left my security man.
- Okay.

863
00:51:44,309 --> 00:51:46,936
I am very much dizzy, paranoid.

864
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:48,313
We'll get you here.

865
00:51:48,397 --> 00:51:53,109
My wife and children decided
maybe it's better to stay in Russia.

866
00:51:53,735 --> 00:51:57,572
Just gotta make sure in the US
that you're okay also.

867
00:51:58,156 --> 00:51:59,491
My daughter...

868
00:52:00,074 --> 00:52:01,075
Yes?

869
00:52:01,618 --> 00:52:03,203
She's getting married.

870
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:05,121
Right.

871
00:52:05,205 --> 00:52:06,873
Married, everything.

872
00:52:09,251 --> 00:52:10,294
It's time.

873
00:52:11,253 --> 00:52:12,254
Okay.

874
00:52:12,337 --> 00:52:14,923
- Cross fingers now.
- You, too.

875
00:52:15,006 --> 00:52:16,883
Remember Orwell.

876
00:52:16,966 --> 00:52:20,554
"We will meet each other
where there is no darkness."

877
00:52:28,853 --> 00:52:31,231
When I first interviewed you
a year ago,

878
00:52:31,315 --> 00:52:33,525
I asked you if you thought
your investigation

879
00:52:33,608 --> 00:52:36,194
would be a defining moment
in the history of sport.

880
00:52:37,028 --> 00:52:38,947
How would you answer that question now?

881
00:52:39,739 --> 00:52:43,451
Yes, it can be a defining moment,
and I think it should.

882
00:52:43,952 --> 00:52:49,249
You've got your number one
Olympic sport in the crosshairs,

883
00:52:49,333 --> 00:52:53,628
and you've got one of the major
Olympic countries in the world

884
00:52:53,712 --> 00:52:54,712
in the crosshairs,

885
00:52:54,754 --> 00:52:57,674
even if it's the crosshairs
only on athletics at the moment.

886
00:52:58,258 --> 00:53:02,429
That has the potential of affecting
the credibility of all sport

887
00:53:02,512 --> 00:53:06,808
and, therefore,
the continued viability of all sport.

888
00:53:06,891 --> 00:53:09,478
Why would I watch an event that's fixed?

889
00:53:45,722 --> 00:53:46,890
There he is.

890
00:53:51,936 --> 00:53:53,938
- I'm here, yes!
- He's escaped.

891
00:53:54,022 --> 00:53:56,775
This is... Yes. Escaped alive.

892
00:53:56,858 --> 00:53:57,859
Come on.

893
00:54:01,530 --> 00:54:02,656
Then you did what?

894
00:54:02,739 --> 00:54:04,842
Destroyed my computer
from my working place.

895
00:54:04,866 --> 00:54:07,952
I took hard disk.
And also, I have three copies.

896
00:54:08,495 --> 00:54:10,455
It's a historical moment.

897
00:54:10,539 --> 00:54:12,541
Grigory, I want you to know

898
00:54:12,624 --> 00:54:15,043
that I understand your desire
to be visible

899
00:54:15,126 --> 00:54:18,755
and I think that's very important
for you, to be safe.

900
00:54:18,838 --> 00:54:23,552
I was on the phone yesterday
with the lawyer for Edward Snowden.

901
00:54:24,135 --> 00:54:26,305
They have some recommendations.

902
00:54:26,388 --> 00:54:30,266
I have everything with me,
and also I destroyed my office computer.

903
00:54:31,142 --> 00:54:34,521
Put it in a very safe place
and dropped there like a dummy.

904
00:54:35,814 --> 00:54:37,565
We'll talk in a few hours.

905
00:54:43,738 --> 00:54:46,574
- This is, uh... This is it.
- Uh-huh.

906
00:54:48,702 --> 00:54:50,161
It's like a labyrinth.

907
00:54:50,244 --> 00:54:51,621
Yeah.

908
00:54:59,338 --> 00:55:01,965
Okay, this is the place.

909
00:55:02,048 --> 00:55:03,633
- Good.
- Here's, um...

910
00:55:04,217 --> 00:55:06,052
bed, bathroom.

911
00:55:06,135 --> 00:55:07,387
Secure place.

912
00:55:08,930 --> 00:55:10,098
It's a good thing.

913
00:55:10,181 --> 00:55:12,976
This'll work, at least till we get
what the plan is

914
00:55:13,059 --> 00:55:14,060
and what we're gonna do.

915
00:55:14,561 --> 00:55:17,230
He goes to me.
He remembers me since May.

916
00:55:17,814 --> 00:55:19,358
You will be learning Russian.

917
00:55:20,024 --> 00:55:22,861
You will be learning Russian very soon.

918
00:55:22,944 --> 00:55:24,320
I'm missing dogs.

919
00:55:27,281 --> 00:55:32,746
There was one thing
that I noticed in the IC report,

920
00:55:32,829 --> 00:55:37,584
and that was that there were KGB people
hanging around the lab.

921
00:55:39,002 --> 00:55:40,754
And that's a real no-no.

922
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:44,215
You know, KGB people are not nice people.

923
00:55:46,551 --> 00:55:48,052
So I am at home.

924
00:55:48,136 --> 00:55:51,473
We will banish all those
who have a suspicious reputation

925
00:55:51,556 --> 00:55:53,349
from the leadership of Russian athletics.

926
00:55:53,433 --> 00:55:58,605
In 60 days, we will present
the renewed athletics with new people...

927
00:55:58,688 --> 00:56:02,358
So, if the KGB...
I guess they're called the FSB now...

928
00:56:03,485 --> 00:56:05,737
they're in the lab,

929
00:56:06,446 --> 00:56:09,741
who else could finance them
but Vitaly Mutko?

930
00:56:10,241 --> 00:56:14,203
Oh, I don't think Vitaly Mutko
finances the FSB.

931
00:56:14,287 --> 00:56:18,041
- That's a state security operation.
- But... but Putin?

932
00:56:18,124 --> 00:56:24,130
Well, whoever finances it
and runs the state security apparatus,

933
00:56:24,213 --> 00:56:27,008
it's not the sport minister.

934
00:56:30,011 --> 00:56:32,691
Officials are essentially saying,
"There may be some problems,

935
00:56:32,722 --> 00:56:35,725
but we are trying
and have already taken steps

936
00:56:35,809 --> 00:56:37,268
to address those problems."

937
00:56:37,351 --> 00:56:41,105
And all of the officials
are essentially rejecting the idea

938
00:56:41,189 --> 00:56:43,357
that there's still a major problem.

939
00:56:43,442 --> 00:56:44,443
Honey, hi.

940
00:56:45,902 --> 00:56:48,447
I am here, far away and in the darkness.

941
00:56:49,531 --> 00:56:51,491
You see them all?

942
00:56:51,991 --> 00:56:55,745
Wearing fancy suits, ties,
making speeches on TV...

943
00:56:56,370 --> 00:56:58,081
It's all a farce.

944
00:57:00,834 --> 00:57:02,836
Of course
I was very disappointed

945
00:57:02,919 --> 00:57:04,463
when laboratory was closed.

946
00:57:06,297 --> 00:57:10,552
Now reading this IC report,
I am just watching with another's eyes.

947
00:57:18,351 --> 00:57:22,439
I know that I could change the past,
telling the truth.

948
00:57:26,443 --> 00:57:30,447
But would you like telling the truth,
you will be annihilated.

949
00:57:39,956 --> 00:57:44,127
George Orwell,
I was reading the first in 1989.

950
00:57:44,836 --> 00:57:46,170
I was 30.

951
00:57:47,714 --> 00:57:50,550
Before that time, in Soviet Union,

952
00:57:50,634 --> 00:57:54,428
the book 1984,
it was strictly, strictly prohibited.

953
00:57:58,182 --> 00:58:00,852
For me, it was totally shocking.

954
00:58:02,771 --> 00:58:05,189
Especially "ignorance is strength."

955
00:58:06,149 --> 00:58:08,151
This is the most powerful thing.

956
00:58:09,193 --> 00:58:11,070
It was my weapon.

957
00:58:11,654 --> 00:58:15,909
It gave me definitions,
it gave me coordinates

958
00:58:15,992 --> 00:58:17,869
how you can apply to your life.

959
00:58:20,121 --> 00:58:21,498
It's like a road map.

960
00:58:24,083 --> 00:58:27,921
"'There are three stages
in your reintegration, ' said O'Brien.

961
00:58:28,672 --> 00:58:31,508
'There is learning,
there is understanding,

962
00:58:31,591 --> 00:58:33,426
and there is acceptance.

963
00:58:40,266 --> 00:58:43,770
It's time for you
to enter upon the first stage.'"

964
00:58:53,029 --> 00:58:54,823
I was thinking that we'd start...

965
00:58:54,906 --> 00:58:58,492
I ask you questions,
and you answer "yes" or "no."

966
00:59:00,453 --> 00:59:03,957
Does Russia have a systematic, statewide
doping system in place

967
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:05,374
to cheat the Olympics?

968
00:59:05,458 --> 00:59:06,543
Yes.

969
00:59:07,835 --> 00:59:11,047
Were you the mastermind
of a statewide system

970
00:59:11,130 --> 00:59:12,715
that cheated the Olympics?

971
00:59:12,799 --> 00:59:15,259
Of course. Yes.

972
00:59:15,343 --> 00:59:20,223
Russia won a total of 73 medals
in the 2008 Beijing Olympics.

973
00:59:20,306 --> 00:59:22,601
How many of those athletes were dirty?

974
00:59:25,436 --> 00:59:26,436
Thirty.

975
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:31,610
Russia won 81 total medals in London.
How many of those were dirty?

976
00:59:31,693 --> 00:59:32,694
Oh, even more.

977
00:59:32,777 --> 00:59:35,279
50% is for sure. Let it be 50%.

978
00:59:35,822 --> 00:59:39,826
They were earned using special program.

979
00:59:39,909 --> 00:59:41,703
State-sponsored, of course.

980
00:59:42,871 --> 00:59:47,166
Was Putin aware of the existence
of a Russian doping system?

981
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:49,418
Yes. Aware of my name.

982
00:59:50,086 --> 00:59:53,506
He took me from the prison
for such special affair.

983
00:59:54,299 --> 00:59:56,050
- From prison?
- Yes.

984
00:59:57,135 --> 00:59:58,386
To redeem.

985
00:59:59,345 --> 01:00:02,015
Okay, let's back up one sec here.

986
01:00:02,098 --> 01:00:05,559
My concern is that it's something
they would use to discredit you.

987
01:00:05,644 --> 01:00:07,020
Oh, of course.

988
01:00:07,103 --> 01:00:12,066
So, the first criminal investigation
against you,

989
01:00:12,150 --> 01:00:13,985
when was it and what happened?

990
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:20,408
Oh, it's not easy to say how it happened.

991
01:00:21,910 --> 01:00:26,831
Before 2008, China was
the biggest producer of anabolics.

992
01:00:27,957 --> 01:00:30,126
It was produced in a pharmaceutical,

993
01:00:30,209 --> 01:00:32,796
well-equipped,
good manufacturing practice.

994
01:00:32,879 --> 01:00:35,298
No contamination, high qualities.

995
01:00:35,381 --> 01:00:38,843
And all these anabolics are coming
to Europe, to the United States.

996
01:00:39,593 --> 01:00:41,387
It's the same like in Russia.

997
01:00:42,221 --> 01:00:45,141
Of course, at that time in Russia,
as the head of laboratory,

998
01:00:46,267 --> 01:00:47,644
I was a part of system.

999
01:00:48,477 --> 01:00:52,315
There are three or four
top-level witch doctors,

1000
01:00:52,398 --> 01:00:54,067
like Portugalov.

1001
01:00:54,150 --> 01:00:58,112
Portugalov was the famous anabolic coach
of Russian national team.

1002
01:00:59,447 --> 01:01:01,615
It was Soviet time. He was before me.

1003
01:01:03,827 --> 01:01:06,245
Portugalov is conveyor of athletes.

1004
01:01:06,913 --> 01:01:11,417
He has his own protocols,
and he really had great success.

1005
01:01:13,044 --> 01:01:15,379
And then they became Olympic champions.

1006
01:01:18,675 --> 01:01:21,344
The problem began in 2008.

1007
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:24,848
Jacques Rogge,
the president of the Olympics,

1008
01:01:24,931 --> 01:01:27,058
told government of China,

1009
01:01:27,141 --> 01:01:32,063
"You are Olympic country,
but you are producing anabolics in bulk.

1010
01:01:32,146 --> 01:01:35,233
You cannot do like this anymore. Stop it."

1011
01:01:35,316 --> 01:01:37,694
They stop it. Officially.

1012
01:01:38,194 --> 01:01:41,072
But who is supplying steroids
to national team?

1013
01:01:41,155 --> 01:01:43,742
Before, there was not any concern.

1014
01:01:43,825 --> 01:01:46,285
You buy stanozolol, it's stanozolol.

1015
01:01:46,369 --> 01:01:48,705
But Portugalov was so confident,

1016
01:01:48,788 --> 01:01:52,583
offering and providing things
which were not proven or tested.

1017
01:01:54,252 --> 01:01:57,005
They have impurities
which could be detectable.

1018
01:01:58,506 --> 01:02:01,760
"Oh," Portugalov say. "What to do?
I spent so much money for this.

1019
01:02:01,843 --> 01:02:03,762
Maybe you could advise to do?"

1020
01:02:03,845 --> 01:02:06,680
What advice? Drop it to the trash.

1021
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:09,142
Now, in Moscow laboratory,

1022
01:02:09,225 --> 01:02:12,270
we had the best sensitivity
and detection limits.

1023
01:02:12,353 --> 01:02:16,232
I'm very proud that I created the test
for long term metabolites,

1024
01:02:16,315 --> 01:02:18,442
which caused the detection window

1025
01:02:18,526 --> 01:02:21,237
to enlarge from two or three weeks
to six months.

1026
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:26,034
That's why Portugalov suddenly had
so many positives.

1027
01:02:27,451 --> 01:02:29,913
All people on the national team,

1028
01:02:29,996 --> 01:02:32,957
they came to ask
where to get these steroids.

1029
01:02:35,835 --> 01:02:37,295
I knew one source.

1030
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:42,591
Suddenly, I was coordinating
the whole steroid program.

1031
01:02:43,426 --> 01:02:45,136
So you were
cutting out Portugalov?

1032
01:02:45,219 --> 01:02:46,971
Yes, but what I was doing,

1033
01:02:47,055 --> 01:02:52,852
I was saving national team
from purchasing dirty steroids.

1034
01:02:55,021 --> 01:02:59,025
Eventually, I don't know
whether it was by purpose,

1035
01:02:59,525 --> 01:03:02,236
I fight with Portugalov.

1036
01:03:03,863 --> 01:03:05,573
Then I became enemy.

1037
01:03:07,450 --> 01:03:11,162
Criminal narcotic police came to my home,
they took my computer,

1038
01:03:11,245 --> 01:03:15,041
and they said,
"Then we arrest you on Monday."

1039
01:03:19,087 --> 01:03:23,174
I was in such depression
and my will was paralyzed.

1040
01:03:26,260 --> 01:03:29,097
And I decided to escape, I don't know how.

1041
01:03:30,556 --> 01:03:32,683
I took some knife from...

1042
01:03:32,766 --> 01:03:35,269
very, very sharp...
from my wife's kitchen.

1043
01:03:35,937 --> 01:03:38,940
I drank whiskey, I sit to the bath.

1044
01:03:40,274 --> 01:03:41,525
And...

1045
01:03:43,736 --> 01:03:46,072
And... it was...

1046
01:03:46,155 --> 01:03:47,824
It goes so smooth.

1047
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:52,912
Then, in the water,
I see how blood is doing like this.

1048
01:03:56,082 --> 01:03:58,709
It wasn't very strong, the lock.

1049
01:03:59,752 --> 01:04:01,087
My wife opened door.

1050
01:04:10,596 --> 01:04:12,806
My heart was seared.

1051
01:04:15,226 --> 01:04:16,895
It was very good surgeon.

1052
01:04:19,856 --> 01:04:22,066
And since I was considered
to be suicide...

1053
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:26,404
I was sent to a psychiatric clinic.

1054
01:04:27,613 --> 01:04:29,908
After seeing that I am depressed,

1055
01:04:30,574 --> 01:04:33,661
they started to give me such crazy drugs.

1056
01:04:37,290 --> 01:04:39,417
I was totally out of reality.

1057
01:04:50,636 --> 01:04:52,430
And then again, something happened.

1058
01:04:53,847 --> 01:04:54,848
The criminal police,

1059
01:04:54,933 --> 01:04:57,851
they sentence me
to another psychiatric clinic...

1060
01:04:59,645 --> 01:05:01,480
which is for those who are sadist,

1061
01:05:01,564 --> 01:05:04,233
who are totally
worst-of-the-worst criminals.

1062
01:05:07,153 --> 01:05:10,323
They respected me very much.
I was called "professor."

1063
01:05:10,406 --> 01:05:12,325
But I get better, better, better.

1064
01:05:13,117 --> 01:05:16,370
The most funny thing,
they allowed me to use computer,

1065
01:05:16,454 --> 01:05:21,084
so I was working in psychiatric clinic
like a head of laboratory director,

1066
01:05:21,167 --> 01:05:23,752
advising the whole Russian national team.

1067
01:05:25,213 --> 01:05:26,380
That time,

1068
01:05:26,464 --> 01:05:30,093
I received, from Olympic Committee,
an invitation to London,

1069
01:05:30,176 --> 01:05:33,262
2012 Olympic Games, being the director.

1070
01:05:34,555 --> 01:05:39,018
Russian ministry was little bit uncertain
that I'm criminal in full.

1071
01:05:42,605 --> 01:05:43,940
But WADA said,

1072
01:05:44,023 --> 01:05:48,277
"If not Rodchenkov, we don't see
in Russia any other candidate than him.

1073
01:05:48,361 --> 01:05:52,156
If you don't send him to London,
we send to London another director."

1074
01:05:52,781 --> 01:05:54,158
You can imagine how important

1075
01:05:54,242 --> 01:05:58,829
information from London laboratory is
for national team.

1076
01:05:59,413 --> 01:06:03,001
I had information, what testing
this London laboratory is doing,

1077
01:06:03,084 --> 01:06:06,587
to understand where we are
and how much is danger.

1078
01:06:07,171 --> 01:06:11,175
Without this, all Russian doping situation
will be collapsed.

1079
01:06:12,969 --> 01:06:15,763
Thanks to God, Mutko understood this.

1080
01:06:16,889 --> 01:06:19,683
I received a call
from the Moscow investigators.

1081
01:06:19,767 --> 01:06:20,767
"Grigory...

1082
01:06:22,019 --> 01:06:23,562
your case is dropped."

1083
01:06:25,106 --> 01:06:27,150
Who took care of it?
Who got the charges dropped?

1084
01:06:27,233 --> 01:06:29,027
Putin. Of course.

1085
01:06:29,527 --> 01:06:33,990
It's my redemption. Success in Sochi
instead of being in prison.

1086
01:06:40,079 --> 01:06:45,001
We are two workers,
Kamaev and Rodchenkov,

1087
01:06:45,084 --> 01:06:47,336
with a mission in mind...

1088
01:06:47,420 --> 01:06:49,505
This is not a mission.
This is a revolution.

1089
01:06:49,588 --> 01:06:52,466
- This is an anti-WADA strategy.
- Of course! Of course!

1090
01:06:55,511 --> 01:06:59,057
The former head of Russia's
anti-doping agency RUSADA

1091
01:06:59,140 --> 01:07:01,267
has unexpectedly died.

1092
01:07:03,686 --> 01:07:07,981
Nikita Kamaev's death comes just
two months after he resigned his post,

1093
01:07:08,066 --> 01:07:11,694
which is, obviously, following
the doping scandal that has rocked Russia

1094
01:07:11,777 --> 01:07:14,196
and the rest of the world in athletics.

1095
01:07:16,490 --> 01:07:19,202
No, no, no.

1096
01:07:19,993 --> 01:07:24,207
No, no, no.

1097
01:07:24,290 --> 01:07:25,749
I have to see.

1098
01:07:26,459 --> 01:07:27,477
We're told by RUSADA,

1099
01:07:27,501 --> 01:07:30,379
which is the doping agency
he was formerly the head of,

1100
01:07:30,463 --> 01:07:33,924
that he appears to have had
a massive heart attack.

1101
01:07:34,007 --> 01:07:35,093
Of course.

1102
01:07:38,387 --> 01:07:39,472
Bryan?

1103
01:07:40,264 --> 01:07:41,265
I'm here.

1104
01:07:41,849 --> 01:07:43,016
You know, my friend?

1105
01:07:45,061 --> 01:07:46,145
My friend...

1106
01:07:47,020 --> 01:07:48,106
died.

1107
01:07:48,939 --> 01:07:50,316
I show you.

1108
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:52,901
He's got no previous history
of heart problems.

1109
01:07:54,778 --> 01:07:57,948
It means, "Grigory, Nikita died."

1110
01:07:58,031 --> 01:08:01,285
He just died.
And so, it's an enormous shock.

1111
01:08:02,120 --> 01:08:04,747
He's my friend
since school time,

1112
01:08:04,830 --> 01:08:08,041
and he never complained about his heart

1113
01:08:08,126 --> 01:08:10,753
or any health problem, and...

1114
01:08:11,712 --> 01:08:14,090
He had a young wife.

1115
01:08:14,173 --> 01:08:17,676
They dreamed about children.
I was talking to him day before.

1116
01:08:18,511 --> 01:08:19,928
This is...

1117
01:08:20,012 --> 01:08:21,847
Still, I cannot understand.

1118
01:08:23,724 --> 01:08:25,143
It cannot be like this.

1119
01:08:27,228 --> 01:08:29,021
He wrote book.

1120
01:08:30,648 --> 01:08:33,567
It's dangerous to write book in Russia.

1121
01:08:35,236 --> 01:08:37,988
I don't know.
We gotta figure this out, because...

1122
01:08:38,071 --> 01:08:39,698
Of course, of course.

1123
01:08:40,824 --> 01:08:43,327
Do you think that they would...

1124
01:08:43,911 --> 01:08:49,250
Bryan, we are playing the most danger game
in the history of sport.

1125
01:08:49,833 --> 01:08:55,047
WADA, ready to pay everything
for me and for you to disappear.

1126
01:08:56,590 --> 01:09:01,053
Because we destroy not only their future,
we destroy their past.

1127
01:09:01,637 --> 01:09:05,766
You know, there is very bad man
still not mentioned.

1128
01:09:05,849 --> 01:09:08,644
Deputy Minister Mutko.

1129
01:09:09,687 --> 01:09:12,064
He could kill everybody.

1130
01:09:13,106 --> 01:09:14,483
He's a KGB man.

1131
01:09:15,359 --> 01:09:19,363
He's very dangerous.
He has no moral at all. No, no.

1132
01:09:20,364 --> 01:09:22,700
"Oh, Nikita is writing book?

1133
01:09:23,826 --> 01:09:26,454
Fifty-two. Oh, he's tired.

1134
01:09:27,538 --> 01:09:28,747
He's desperate.

1135
01:09:28,831 --> 01:09:32,710
Oh, please, prepare obituary
for the next week."

1136
01:09:33,836 --> 01:09:36,714
Can you imagine? I can imagine easily.

1137
01:09:41,427 --> 01:09:43,846
We should be very much careful.

1138
01:09:47,308 --> 01:09:49,018
Who were you reporting to?

1139
01:09:51,395 --> 01:09:53,689
Yuri Nagornykh, vice minister.

1140
01:09:56,484 --> 01:09:59,320
He was practically involved
in everyday routine.

1141
01:10:00,363 --> 01:10:03,073
- So you would report to Yuri?
- Yes.

1142
01:10:03,156 --> 01:10:05,177
- Yuri would report to Mutko?
- Yes.

1143
01:10:05,201 --> 01:10:07,881
- And Mutko reported to Putin?
- To Putin, yes.

1144
01:10:12,416 --> 01:10:15,503
You know, there is no rest
if you are paranoid.

1145
01:10:15,586 --> 01:10:18,214
It was around 12:30,
one o'clock at night?

1146
01:10:18,589 --> 01:10:21,467
Or two. I don't know.

1147
01:10:21,550 --> 01:10:23,927
They were just hanging around, so...

1148
01:10:24,011 --> 01:10:27,514
- Somebody in the courtyard?
- Yes.

1149
01:10:28,849 --> 01:10:34,187
Two strong men knocked my door
and appeared from darkness.

1150
01:10:35,022 --> 01:10:38,359
They asked me to let them in,
and they came here.

1151
01:10:38,901 --> 01:10:44,531
And we were talking about sport,
about many relevant or auxiliary things.

1152
01:10:46,158 --> 01:10:48,702
They knew about death of Nikita Kamaev.

1153
01:10:50,037 --> 01:10:54,583
About, first of all,
my boss, Minister Mutko.

1154
01:10:55,417 --> 01:10:58,629
It was inspection and...

1155
01:10:58,712 --> 01:11:00,631
Exhausts my nerves...

1156
01:11:00,714 --> 01:11:03,759
They finally gave me subpoena.

1157
01:11:03,842 --> 01:11:06,219
United States district court.

1158
01:11:06,720 --> 01:11:09,932
You see, it's for me.
"To Grigory Rodchenkov."

1159
01:11:10,808 --> 01:11:14,853
You're commanded to appear
in front of the grand jury.

1160
01:11:22,570 --> 01:11:26,407
He had been approached
by two FBI agents.

1161
01:11:28,909 --> 01:11:31,287
They want him to go to New York

1162
01:11:32,204 --> 01:11:36,959
and appear in a grand jury
and provide his information.

1163
01:11:38,168 --> 01:11:41,797
It triggered a whole series of decisions
that had to be made.

1164
01:11:43,841 --> 01:11:45,884
I've checked out these two guys,

1165
01:11:45,968 --> 01:11:50,764
and both of these guys
are not your everyday agent.

1166
01:11:50,848 --> 01:11:52,516
But why did they come to him?

1167
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:54,852
They want him for something else
that they're doing.

1168
01:11:54,935 --> 01:11:56,395
They didn't come to him for himself.

1169
01:11:57,313 --> 01:11:59,565
They're trying to make a case,

1170
01:11:59,648 --> 01:12:01,525
and they found out he was in LA.

1171
01:12:02,192 --> 01:12:06,238
His boss, Mutko, was actually the guy.

1172
01:12:06,322 --> 01:12:07,906
How was he able to survive?

1173
01:12:07,990 --> 01:12:11,243
Because he's Putin's best friend.
He's the head of the sports ministry.

1174
01:12:11,327 --> 01:12:15,247
Just what sort of, uh... crime...

1175
01:12:15,331 --> 01:12:19,501
like, example, I could be done against
or under US legislature?

1176
01:12:19,585 --> 01:12:23,839
The United States Justice Department loves
to charge broad conspiracies.

1177
01:12:23,922 --> 01:12:26,425
That's their favorite charging instrument.

1178
01:12:26,509 --> 01:12:30,095
That you conspired
with Mutko and others to...

1179
01:12:30,178 --> 01:12:33,891
What is the conspiracy?
It was conspiracy since 1980.

1180
01:12:33,974 --> 01:12:35,643
Let's reconsider Moscow Olympic Games,

1181
01:12:35,726 --> 01:12:39,187
and then reconsider situation
in United States in 1984.

1182
01:12:39,271 --> 01:12:41,231
That's right.

1183
01:12:41,315 --> 01:12:46,070
They're looking for him to plea
to what's called a cooperation agreement.

1184
01:12:46,153 --> 01:12:48,864
What happens is, he cooperates,
and at the end of the day,

1185
01:12:48,947 --> 01:12:52,451
the judge generally
wouldn't incarcerate him, most likely.

1186
01:12:52,535 --> 01:12:55,162
First of all,
we don't know whether that's...

1187
01:12:55,245 --> 01:12:57,581
what the bureau's interested in
at this point.

1188
01:12:57,665 --> 01:13:00,959
If we turn down,
they could indict him.

1189
01:13:01,043 --> 01:13:03,629
- You gotta be shitting me.
- We can talk to these guys.

1190
01:13:05,631 --> 01:13:08,884
The most important thing
is he is not sent back to Russia,

1191
01:13:08,967 --> 01:13:11,387
where he would certainly be assassinated.

1192
01:13:12,513 --> 01:13:14,473
We've been discussing with Grigory

1193
01:13:14,557 --> 01:13:17,142
whether or not he should go public
in some way

1194
01:13:17,225 --> 01:13:18,394
prior to the Olympics.

1195
01:13:18,477 --> 01:13:20,517
Prior to the Olympics.
What you're saying is

1196
01:13:20,563 --> 01:13:22,981
if he's established
as a cooperating witness,

1197
01:13:23,065 --> 01:13:24,357
he may not be able to do that.

1198
01:13:24,442 --> 01:13:27,027
That's right. That's right.
Which is a downside.

1199
01:13:27,110 --> 01:13:30,113
But once Grigory's public,
I think he's in much less danger.

1200
01:13:30,197 --> 01:13:32,199
Because if the Russians do anything
to hurt him,

1201
01:13:32,282 --> 01:13:33,576
it makes them look very guilty.

1202
01:13:33,659 --> 01:13:36,345
Except they'll just say
he had a heart attack, like they did...

1203
01:13:36,369 --> 01:13:38,288
Grigory, look at me.

1204
01:13:39,164 --> 01:13:43,461
Is it in your best interest
to break the story?

1205
01:13:44,294 --> 01:13:45,546
Uh...

1206
01:13:45,629 --> 01:13:48,256
You mean to disclose? We have to disclose.

1207
01:13:49,758 --> 01:13:53,386
Please enter
your participant ID. Thank you.

1208
01:13:56,849 --> 01:14:01,103
I strongly suggest
they stay only with list of 36 athletes.

1209
01:14:01,186 --> 01:14:02,980
Okay.
But they're about to publish.

1210
01:14:03,063 --> 01:14:06,484
They're asking us how they can verify
the authenticity of the Sochi list.

1211
01:14:06,567 --> 01:14:09,319
Yes, this is most important.
It's authentic document.

1212
01:14:09,402 --> 01:14:11,530
It was in Sochi on my table.

1213
01:14:11,614 --> 01:14:15,075
And if you go behind this list,
there is creation date.

1214
01:14:15,158 --> 01:14:17,077
And this list came
from the ministry?

1215
01:14:17,160 --> 01:14:18,704
Of course, of course.

1216
01:14:18,787 --> 01:14:20,372
So, Rebecca, you have the file.

1217
01:14:20,456 --> 01:14:23,959
So under properties of the file,
you can see it was created

1218
01:14:24,042 --> 01:14:27,129
Tuesday, January 21st, from the ministry.

1219
01:15:00,538 --> 01:15:03,916
Oh, my God! You're unrecognizable!

1220
01:15:03,999 --> 01:15:05,208
Not recognizable at all.

1221
01:15:06,293 --> 01:15:09,087
Psychological, looking in mirror,
it's not me.

1222
01:15:09,755 --> 01:15:11,840
The New York Times is breaking tomorrow.

1223
01:15:11,924 --> 01:15:13,759
- Tomorrow?
- Tomorrow.

1224
01:15:13,842 --> 01:15:16,178
Oh, I need... I need...

1225
01:15:16,595 --> 01:15:18,055
Intravenous injections

1226
01:15:18,764 --> 01:15:20,641
- to relax. Tomorrow?
- Tomorrow.

1227
01:15:20,724 --> 01:15:23,268
- Why not?
- Okay, so here's what's happening.

1228
01:15:24,853 --> 01:15:27,480
Have you spoke
to the Department of Justice yet?

1229
01:15:27,565 --> 01:15:29,274
I told them,

1230
01:15:29,357 --> 01:15:31,359
and they reacted
like I expected they would.

1231
01:15:31,443 --> 01:15:32,444
They're upset.

1232
01:15:32,528 --> 01:15:33,571
- Right.
- So...

1233
01:15:33,654 --> 01:15:36,574
They wanted to know,
did he provide any documents to them?

1234
01:15:37,157 --> 01:15:41,203
He provided lists
of doped athletes.

1235
01:15:41,704 --> 01:15:47,668
He provided an FSB file
of how the testing was arranged at Sochi.

1236
01:15:47,751 --> 01:15:51,797
Yeah, unfortunately,
they're gonna terminate the whole...

1237
01:15:53,090 --> 01:15:56,384
Now that he turned over documents,
they're gonna cancel.

1238
01:15:56,927 --> 01:15:58,845
And they're just gonna prosecute him.

1239
01:16:04,392 --> 01:16:07,520
"It's time for you
to enter upon the second stage."

1240
01:16:11,399 --> 01:16:13,526
The International Olympic Committee

1241
01:16:13,610 --> 01:16:15,112
has the honor of announcing

1242
01:16:15,195 --> 01:16:19,575
that the 22nd Olympic Winter Games in 2014

1243
01:16:19,658 --> 01:16:22,202
are awarded to the city of Sochi.

1244
01:16:25,873 --> 01:16:30,210
That's future for everything.
That's future for my country! For Russia!

1245
01:16:31,795 --> 01:16:35,507
Millions of citizens of Russia are united
by the Olympic dream.

1246
01:16:36,383 --> 01:16:41,138
Our national pledge to you is,
the choice of Sochi is the best choice.

1247
01:16:43,724 --> 01:16:47,019
There is a top-level decision.

1248
01:16:47,102 --> 01:16:48,270
You know who I mean.

1249
01:16:48,854 --> 01:16:52,482
And big boss, Vladimir Putin, saying,

1250
01:16:52,565 --> 01:16:56,779
"We have to show the best result in Sochi.

1251
01:16:56,862 --> 01:16:59,072
We must show the others who we are."

1252
01:16:59,740 --> 01:17:03,285
- Hurrah!
- Hurrah!

1253
01:17:04,577 --> 01:17:06,914
Hurrah!

1254
01:17:06,997 --> 01:17:11,001
We could make team clean
before Sochi. One month.

1255
01:17:16,089 --> 01:17:21,178
But it was decided
to use PEDs during Sochi.

1256
01:17:22,721 --> 01:17:26,391
Through the competition
so they could be at their very top level?

1257
01:17:26,474 --> 01:17:27,474
Right, right.

1258
01:17:28,518 --> 01:17:30,062
Vladimir Putin.

1259
01:17:31,688 --> 01:17:34,524
So instead of using the science,

1260
01:17:34,983 --> 01:17:38,236
the science that you developed
to get around the system,

1261
01:17:39,362 --> 01:17:40,739
you abandoned the science?

1262
01:17:40,823 --> 01:17:41,824
Yes.

1263
01:17:42,825 --> 01:17:45,327
The most important "yes."
Forget about this.

1264
01:17:46,203 --> 01:17:47,663
Ladies and gentlemen,

1265
01:17:47,746 --> 01:17:54,336
let me declare the 126th session
of the International Olympic Committee

1266
01:17:54,419 --> 01:17:55,671
open.

1267
01:17:55,754 --> 01:17:58,548
Thank you.

1268
01:18:07,140 --> 01:18:10,352
Opening ceremony was
the most heartbreaking day...

1269
01:18:12,020 --> 01:18:13,731
in sports history.

1270
01:18:21,864 --> 01:18:24,783
- Hi, Bryan.
- The story just broke.

1271
01:18:24,867 --> 01:18:28,829
What do you mean?
Is it published or not?

1272
01:18:28,912 --> 01:18:30,622
Yes, published.

1273
01:18:30,706 --> 01:18:32,624
Published! The story is published!

1274
01:18:32,708 --> 01:18:36,503
According
to The New York Times, Rodchenkov...

1275
01:18:37,170 --> 01:18:38,170
Okay.

1276
01:18:40,257 --> 01:18:42,300
This is the photo of bottles.

1277
01:18:42,384 --> 01:18:45,470
Those bottles were given
from Nikita Kamaev.

1278
01:18:46,096 --> 01:18:48,556
"Grigory Rodchenkov,
who ran the laboratory

1279
01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:51,101
that handled testing
for thousands of Olympians,

1280
01:18:51,184 --> 01:18:54,604
said he developed a three-drug cocktail
of banned substances

1281
01:18:54,687 --> 01:18:58,233
that he mixed with liquor and provided
to dozens of Russian athletes,

1282
01:18:58,316 --> 01:19:01,194
helping to facilitate
one of the most elaborate

1283
01:19:01,278 --> 01:19:04,865
and successful doping ploys
in sport history."

1284
01:19:10,203 --> 01:19:13,791
Join and support
our fight for fair play.

1285
01:19:14,541 --> 01:19:16,459
The athletes deserve it.

1286
01:19:18,045 --> 01:19:22,299
And to you, my fellow Olympic athletes,

1287
01:19:22,382 --> 01:19:28,013
I say, respect the rules,
play fair, be clean.

1288
01:19:32,225 --> 01:19:33,894
In 2014, in Sochi,

1289
01:19:34,477 --> 01:19:39,942
did Russia swap out dirty urine
for clean urine?

1290
01:19:41,193 --> 01:19:42,193
Always.

1291
01:19:53,205 --> 01:19:56,083
The information contained
in this little bottle

1292
01:19:56,166 --> 01:19:59,086
helps keep sport
on the level playing field.

1293
01:19:59,169 --> 01:20:01,254
That's why we created ADAMS,

1294
01:20:01,338 --> 01:20:05,217
the free Anti-Doping Administration
and Management System from WADA.

1295
01:20:05,300 --> 01:20:10,222
All operating under a level of security
typically used by financial institutions.

1296
01:20:10,305 --> 01:20:12,850
In effect,
becoming the centralized clearing house

1297
01:20:12,933 --> 01:20:14,810
for all anti-doping information.

1298
01:20:15,477 --> 01:20:18,771
ADAMS. Everyone should play true.

1299
01:20:22,525 --> 01:20:25,362
Walk us through
the collection process.

1300
01:20:25,445 --> 01:20:29,366
The sample is provided
in front of a doping control officer.

1301
01:20:29,449 --> 01:20:31,910
It's in this container.
It's divided into two.

1302
01:20:32,702 --> 01:20:35,831
The A sample and the B sample.
These are the...

1303
01:20:35,914 --> 01:20:37,934
- Bottles.
- They're called the Bereg-Kits?

1304
01:20:37,958 --> 01:20:42,128
Yes. It's one particular company
in Switzerland that makes them.

1305
01:20:42,838 --> 01:20:44,631
It's called
the Berlinger bottle,

1306
01:20:44,714 --> 01:20:47,300
and the Berlinger bottle is
state of the art.

1307
01:20:47,384 --> 01:20:51,471
It's sealed very tight
with a vice-like device.

1308
01:20:51,554 --> 01:20:54,182
A collector is right there, watching.

1309
01:20:57,269 --> 01:20:58,728
And then it goes to the lab.

1310
01:21:00,981 --> 01:21:05,818
It's in the lab that the B bottles are
pulled aside and put in the freezer.

1311
01:21:08,280 --> 01:21:11,449
The analytical work is done
on the A sample.

1312
01:21:12,993 --> 01:21:14,428
The way we collect the sample,

1313
01:21:14,452 --> 01:21:16,371
the trustability of the sample,

1314
01:21:16,454 --> 01:21:18,498
the fact that we've got
an A and a B sample

1315
01:21:18,581 --> 01:21:21,626
is a very, very, uh, safe system.

1316
01:21:22,460 --> 01:21:24,546
The caps on the bottles,

1317
01:21:24,629 --> 01:21:28,800
they're designed in such a way that
they need to be destroyed to be taken off.

1318
01:21:28,884 --> 01:21:33,096
In the lab, they have a device
that cracks open the A sample.

1319
01:21:34,222 --> 01:21:36,058
It's the only way you can get it off.

1320
01:21:37,184 --> 01:21:42,064
If an A sample tests positive,
then the B gets analyzed.

1321
01:21:42,689 --> 01:21:44,566
The B has to confirm the A.

1322
01:21:45,317 --> 01:21:48,069
That's this enormous protection.

1323
01:21:49,612 --> 01:21:52,324
From Nagornykh,
in preparation to Sochi,

1324
01:21:52,407 --> 01:21:58,705
it was strict order to develop procedure
how we can have new bottles,

1325
01:21:58,788 --> 01:22:00,582
new caps or open cap.

1326
01:22:01,666 --> 01:22:04,044
And this FSB officer,

1327
01:22:04,127 --> 01:22:09,549
he was responsible for the day
when I gave closed Bereg-Kit,

1328
01:22:09,632 --> 01:22:12,385
and after half an hour,
I receive it opened.

1329
01:22:12,469 --> 01:22:13,511
And the...

1330
01:22:14,429 --> 01:22:17,515
cap and the bottle are the same.

1331
01:22:17,599 --> 01:22:19,226
And I can...

1332
01:22:19,309 --> 01:22:22,729
A little bit rinse
and then pour and close.

1333
01:22:24,356 --> 01:22:25,648
Like Bereg-Kit.

1334
01:22:26,358 --> 01:22:28,276
It's unbelievable how they could do this.

1335
01:22:33,240 --> 01:22:36,326
This was named Operation Sochi Resultat.

1336
01:22:37,452 --> 01:22:41,039
In Russian, "Resultat" means
"to achieve positive results."

1337
01:22:42,665 --> 01:22:44,251
So, you need clean urines?

1338
01:22:44,334 --> 01:22:46,962
I need clean urines
for each candidate.

1339
01:22:47,045 --> 01:22:52,384
For every single Russian athlete
under the state-sponsored doping,

1340
01:22:53,051 --> 01:22:57,930
you had clean samples
of their urine being held?

1341
01:22:58,015 --> 01:22:59,349
Yes.

1342
01:22:59,432 --> 01:23:04,146
If an athlete needed
to be swapped, you could swap 'em.

1343
01:23:04,229 --> 01:23:05,063
Yes.

1344
01:23:05,147 --> 01:23:11,069
But in Sochi, because of the Olympics,
I am under double control.

1345
01:23:11,153 --> 01:23:14,614
Both from IOC, WADA and I don't know who.

1346
01:23:15,240 --> 01:23:19,244
Level of security is stunning.
It's unbelievable.

1347
01:23:21,204 --> 01:23:23,244
There was a delegation
of foreign scientists

1348
01:23:23,290 --> 01:23:25,042
who were embedded in the laboratory.

1349
01:23:25,125 --> 01:23:28,003
So, if there were substitutions,
manipulations,

1350
01:23:28,086 --> 01:23:30,755
these people would've been
in the front line to observe this.

1351
01:23:32,632 --> 01:23:34,967
In Sochi, laboratory was like this.

1352
01:23:35,635 --> 01:23:37,012
It was our entrance,

1353
01:23:37,095 --> 01:23:40,265
but from this behind,
where we have a fire exit,

1354
01:23:40,348 --> 01:23:43,560
there is another building.
It was a KGB building.

1355
01:23:43,643 --> 01:23:46,229
And bank of clean urines were kept here.

1356
01:23:46,313 --> 01:23:49,107
Coming into the final two heats
of the four-man bobsleigh,

1357
01:23:49,191 --> 01:23:52,777
Pilot Alexander Zubkov
and brakeman Alexey Voevoda...

1358
01:24:01,203 --> 01:24:02,620
Gold to Russia,

1359
01:24:02,704 --> 01:24:06,583
making their pilot the oldest man ever
to win the four-man bobsleigh.

1360
01:24:07,917 --> 01:24:11,546
So how many FSB officers
were working at Sochi?

1361
01:24:12,880 --> 01:24:13,881
Hundred.

1362
01:24:16,093 --> 01:24:18,345
Throughout the day, our KGB officer

1363
01:24:18,428 --> 01:24:21,973
brought the clean urines
of all our athletes selected for testing

1364
01:24:22,057 --> 01:24:25,185
to our secret operational room
in the laboratory.

1365
01:24:25,935 --> 01:24:29,689
Meanwhile, all the urines collected
from the athletes during the day

1366
01:24:29,772 --> 01:24:33,818
were transported to the Olympic village
and held until 1:00 or 2:00 a.m.

1367
01:24:34,736 --> 01:24:36,154
Then I received a call.

1368
01:24:36,237 --> 01:24:39,449
"Grigory, I will be delivering the samples
in 15 minutes."

1369
01:24:40,033 --> 01:24:42,869
Before samples arrived,
it gave me time to make sure

1370
01:24:42,952 --> 01:24:47,624
that there were no WADA or IOC observers
left snooping around the laboratory.

1371
01:24:49,917 --> 01:24:51,836
Once samples were checked in,

1372
01:24:51,919 --> 01:24:54,797
the operation entered
the most dangerous phase.

1373
01:24:55,673 --> 01:24:59,636
When the A and B bottles
were split on to two different carts,

1374
01:24:59,719 --> 01:25:02,764
my assistant wheeled the B bottles
into a storage room

1375
01:25:02,847 --> 01:25:06,684
and slipped the Russian athletes'
B bottles into his lab coat.

1376
01:25:07,519 --> 01:25:11,439
This is highly illegal,
but we need to replace these dirty urines.

1377
01:25:12,232 --> 01:25:14,442
Then he wheeled the cart
with the A bottles

1378
01:25:14,526 --> 01:25:17,154
into the aliquoting room,
as per procedure.

1379
01:25:18,155 --> 01:25:19,822
'Cause it's supposed to be opened.

1380
01:25:19,906 --> 01:25:22,074
For all A samples, yes.

1381
01:25:24,911 --> 01:25:28,498
To escape all the video recording,
aliquoting room was like this.

1382
01:25:28,581 --> 01:25:33,420
And our room, we had the hole in it.

1383
01:25:33,503 --> 01:25:36,297
So we take this little bit...

1384
01:25:36,381 --> 01:25:39,008
- How you say this thing? It's...
- Uh...

1385
01:25:39,092 --> 01:25:40,927
Like this, if you have something...

1386
01:25:41,427 --> 01:25:44,556
You take this table out,
and there is a... like a...

1387
01:25:45,098 --> 01:25:50,186
like a power outlet blocked
without any, uh... socket.

1388
01:25:50,270 --> 01:25:52,480
- Okay, right, right.
- But then you take it out.

1389
01:25:52,564 --> 01:25:55,650
So it looks like it's a power outlet
without a socket, but it's not.

1390
01:25:55,733 --> 01:25:57,569
- It's not. It's a hole.
- It's a hole.

1391
01:25:59,028 --> 01:26:02,073
You're taking both samples
through this hole,

1392
01:26:02,157 --> 01:26:04,451
and A samples, we immediately...

1393
01:26:05,034 --> 01:26:06,578
pour away and clean.

1394
01:26:07,329 --> 01:26:08,455
But the B sample...

1395
01:26:09,080 --> 01:26:11,666
B samples are taken
by KGB and... whew!

1396
01:26:13,042 --> 01:26:16,879
In the darkness,
people coming from the trash/fire exit.

1397
01:26:18,840 --> 01:26:25,054
Then, after two hours, they came back
with B bottles opened to swap.

1398
01:26:25,805 --> 01:26:28,891
Because, of course,
you have in advance clean urine.

1399
01:26:29,976 --> 01:26:33,813
So, B samples are finished
with the urine swapping.

1400
01:26:33,896 --> 01:26:36,148
Taken by KGB and...

1401
01:26:36,233 --> 01:26:40,737
Because the B samples are taken
by the IOC and held in long-term storage.

1402
01:26:40,820 --> 01:26:41,821
Yes.

1403
01:26:43,323 --> 01:26:48,160
If WADA or the IOC retest
those samples, would they be clean?

1404
01:26:48,745 --> 01:26:51,956
Reanalysis will return negative.

1405
01:26:52,790 --> 01:26:55,585
Because, you know,
we are top-level cheaters.

1406
01:26:56,794 --> 01:27:00,131
To over-cheat us,
you should be much such experienced.

1407
01:27:00,215 --> 01:27:02,342
But how it comes, such experience?

1408
01:27:10,267 --> 01:27:12,184
If there were
evidence brought forward

1409
01:27:12,269 --> 01:27:14,145
that showed that a country or WADA lab

1410
01:27:14,229 --> 01:27:17,857
had found a way
to break into the collection bottles,

1411
01:27:17,940 --> 01:27:22,069
what do you think that would say
about the entire testing system?

1412
01:27:22,153 --> 01:27:26,658
What it would say is that corruption
has gone to the depths of...

1413
01:27:28,618 --> 01:27:32,163
that part of the process,
which would be most disturbing.

1414
01:27:33,122 --> 01:27:34,249
It would be, uh...

1415
01:27:35,583 --> 01:27:42,424
obviously a very serious, serious act
of manipulation from that lab.

1416
01:27:43,300 --> 01:27:45,635
It would be done. It wouldn't work.

1417
01:27:45,718 --> 01:27:51,223
If that can be done successfully,
then the testing system is over.

1418
01:27:51,766 --> 01:27:56,187
Does WADA have the ability
to catch drug cheats today?

1419
01:27:58,356 --> 01:27:59,441
No.

1420
01:28:11,619 --> 01:28:14,163
Because of this whole steroid program,

1421
01:28:14,247 --> 01:28:16,332
I pulled off 13 gold medals.

1422
01:28:16,416 --> 01:28:17,542
It's unbelievable.

1423
01:28:19,252 --> 01:28:21,045
Never before.

1424
01:28:22,714 --> 01:28:27,259
Everything was made clean,
and Putin was very much happy.

1425
01:28:44,151 --> 01:28:46,237
Russia came out on top
of the medals board,

1426
01:28:46,321 --> 01:28:51,451
winning 33 overall,
including an Olympic high of 13 gold.

1427
01:29:12,972 --> 01:29:18,060
But immediately after,
he started war against Ukraine.

1428
01:29:23,107 --> 01:29:24,233
Before the Olympics,

1429
01:29:24,316 --> 01:29:28,488
his popularity rating in Russia
had been falling steadily for years.

1430
01:29:28,571 --> 01:29:31,198
But when the games began, this.

1431
01:29:35,327 --> 01:29:38,831
I felt my personal guilt
for such event.

1432
01:29:38,915 --> 01:29:44,378
Would Russia had less medals,
Putin would be not such aggressive.

1433
01:29:51,469 --> 01:29:54,514
What you're about to hear
is not lifted from a Tom Clancy novel,

1434
01:29:54,597 --> 01:29:57,809
nor is it borrowed from
the elegant prose of John Le Carré

1435
01:29:57,892 --> 01:30:00,478
or adapted from Robert Ludlum's work.

1436
01:30:00,562 --> 01:30:02,229
But if the protagonist is to be believed,

1437
01:30:02,313 --> 01:30:04,982
this drama is the ultimate handiwork
of Vladimir Putin

1438
01:30:05,066 --> 01:30:08,360
and the intelligence successors
to the KGB.

1439
01:30:08,445 --> 01:30:11,823
LA may be a lot safer than Mother Russia,
given the recent...

1440
01:30:11,906 --> 01:30:13,450
- Bryan!
- Yeah?

1441
01:30:13,950 --> 01:30:17,620
Article is incredible. It's so very good.

1442
01:30:18,204 --> 01:30:20,164
I am shocked. I'm reading twice.

1443
01:30:20,247 --> 01:30:23,084
You know, Russia even cannot breathe.

1444
01:30:23,167 --> 01:30:25,419
They still even don't respond.

1445
01:30:25,503 --> 01:30:28,590
- Of course, there it is, midnight, but...
- Let me stop you.

1446
01:30:29,131 --> 01:30:32,134
- I just spoke to our lawyer.
- What happened?

1447
01:30:32,218 --> 01:30:35,555
They're not returning any
of his calls.

1448
01:30:36,806 --> 01:30:37,807
I am arrested?

1449
01:30:38,516 --> 01:30:42,478
We don't know yet.
We're in a holding pattern.

1450
01:30:45,940 --> 01:30:49,318
I am sitting locked in my home.
I'm a little bit afraid.

1451
01:30:49,401 --> 01:30:51,654
Let me get this done,
and I'll come by, okay?

1452
01:30:51,738 --> 01:30:52,822
Putin will kill me.

1453
01:30:54,157 --> 01:30:56,659
- Rodchenkov...
- allegations...

1454
01:30:56,742 --> 01:30:59,454
Dozens of Sochi medal winners
were part of a secret...

1455
01:30:59,537 --> 01:31:00,913
Nine, one, seven.

1456
01:31:04,584 --> 01:31:06,961
Okay.

1457
01:31:07,587 --> 01:31:11,007
He has since fled Russia
because he said he feared for his life.

1458
01:31:11,090 --> 01:31:14,426
Russia's sports minister
has dismissed the claims as nonsense,

1459
01:31:14,511 --> 01:31:17,972
adding they were a continuation
of the attack on Russian sport,

1460
01:31:18,055 --> 01:31:20,975
which was backed up
by the deputy sports minister.

1461
01:31:21,058 --> 01:31:24,604
So that this is clear
for everyone...

1462
01:31:24,687 --> 01:31:28,190
there has never been
and there is not any doping program.

1463
01:31:28,274 --> 01:31:32,028
Vladimir Putin calls
the claims "the slander of a turncoat."

1464
01:31:34,113 --> 01:31:36,574
We're meeting
with a white-collar attorney

1465
01:31:36,658 --> 01:31:39,368
who has handled a lot of criminal cases.

1466
01:31:39,451 --> 01:31:41,263
What happened
with his other lawyer?

1467
01:31:41,287 --> 01:31:44,498
His other lawyer,
they have a Moscow office.

1468
01:31:44,582 --> 01:31:51,463
It appears that the firm got cold feet due
to a conflict of interest, they said.

1469
01:31:52,256 --> 01:31:55,009
Thomas Bach,
who heads the IOC, said,

1470
01:31:55,092 --> 01:31:56,427
"If this is true,

1471
01:31:56,511 --> 01:32:00,014
it is an unimaginable level
of criminality."

1472
01:32:00,181 --> 01:32:03,643
The IOC
calling the report "very worrying."

1473
01:32:03,726 --> 01:32:05,645
"We ask
the World Anti-Doping Agency

1474
01:32:05,728 --> 01:32:07,897
to investigate immediately."

1475
01:32:08,940 --> 01:32:11,221
The Justice Department
is opening an investigation

1476
01:32:11,275 --> 01:32:13,861
into Russian government officials,
athletes, coaches

1477
01:32:13,945 --> 01:32:15,655
and anti-doping authorities.

1478
01:32:23,412 --> 01:32:25,582
This letter was sent by WADA.

1479
01:32:25,665 --> 01:32:29,543
"Dear Grigory, in light of your recent
declarations to The New York Times,

1480
01:32:29,627 --> 01:32:31,545
we would like to meet to better understand

1481
01:32:31,629 --> 01:32:34,465
the basis of your allegations
and your proposed way forward.

1482
01:32:34,548 --> 01:32:38,094
Sincerely, David Howman
and Olivier Niggli."

1483
01:32:38,845 --> 01:32:42,306
I'm talking tomorrow to another lawyer.

1484
01:32:43,683 --> 01:32:44,684
So...

1485
01:32:45,893 --> 01:32:49,396
He seems credible, but of course,
it's his word against Russia.

1486
01:32:49,480 --> 01:32:51,315
There were older questions

1487
01:32:51,398 --> 01:32:53,359
regarding Rodchenkov's mental health
in all this,

1488
01:32:53,442 --> 01:32:55,402
as four years ago,
after a failed suicide attempt,

1489
01:32:55,486 --> 01:32:58,322
he was placed into a mental institution,

1490
01:32:58,405 --> 01:33:03,285
the diagnosis described
as the first stages of schizophrenia.

1491
01:33:04,328 --> 01:33:07,915
What to do with my wife
and children? What they will know?

1492
01:33:07,999 --> 01:33:10,835
Or I just disappear for them?
They'll go crazy.

1493
01:33:11,460 --> 01:33:15,715
Bryan, this is David and Olivier.
We want this meeting to go ahead.

1494
01:33:15,798 --> 01:33:17,592
Can you call us back?

1495
01:33:19,761 --> 01:33:21,638
I'm not ready to answer.

1496
01:33:25,892 --> 01:33:30,062
We need something lucky,
like it's Alice in Wonderland,

1497
01:33:30,146 --> 01:33:32,732
to rabbit's hole, to sit here.

1498
01:33:32,815 --> 01:33:35,484
- I know.
- To wait until it ends.

1499
01:33:35,568 --> 01:33:38,237
I know. That's why I wanna...

1500
01:33:38,320 --> 01:33:41,323
We're trying to get this...
To make it right.

1501
01:33:41,407 --> 01:33:43,367
But lawyer is trustful?

1502
01:33:43,450 --> 01:33:45,787
- He is a big one.
- He's a big one.

1503
01:33:45,870 --> 01:33:48,140
- Yeah, top of the top of the top.
- Yes.

1504
01:33:48,164 --> 01:33:50,958
We are digging deeper into his identity.

1505
01:33:52,043 --> 01:33:55,212
We've obtained
some of his exclusive documents.

1506
01:33:58,716 --> 01:34:00,156
Grigory Rodchenkov

1507
01:34:00,217 --> 01:34:02,178
and American movie director Bryan Fogel,

1508
01:34:02,261 --> 01:34:06,598
they talked many times
via e-mail and wrote...

1509
01:34:07,474 --> 01:34:11,187
The FBI are following him closely,

1510
01:34:11,270 --> 01:34:15,399
Grigory Rodchenkov himself mentioned
to his sister in a recent Skype call.

1511
01:34:15,482 --> 01:34:18,235
Grish,
just sit tight. Don't be too impulsive.

1512
01:34:18,319 --> 01:34:21,447
No, of course
I will not do anything...

1513
01:34:21,530 --> 01:34:23,282
Of course. Absolutely.

1514
01:34:23,365 --> 01:34:26,327
Without the protection
of the FBI.

1515
01:34:32,374 --> 01:34:35,586
I refuse to make any
comments on this. I'm very sorry.

1516
01:34:35,669 --> 01:34:40,091
I'm sure you have very intelligent people
who can explain all this.

1517
01:34:43,385 --> 01:34:46,425
Honey, I already
spoke to the children. They're fine.

1518
01:34:46,472 --> 01:34:50,101
Grisha,
now it's another problem.

1519
01:34:50,184 --> 01:34:51,769
I'm worried about you.

1520
01:34:52,644 --> 01:34:54,605
I'll take care of this.
Just hold on.

1521
01:34:54,688 --> 01:34:57,524
This is what I'm worried about.

1522
01:34:57,608 --> 01:35:01,237
They're turning us into the monster now.

1523
01:35:02,863 --> 01:35:04,532
Or trying to.

1524
01:35:04,615 --> 01:35:06,743
It's okay.
We'll get through this.

1525
01:35:10,996 --> 01:35:13,374
What do you want
to come of all this?

1526
01:35:20,381 --> 01:35:22,549
"To the future or to the past,

1527
01:35:25,344 --> 01:35:28,264
to a time when thought is free...

1528
01:35:31,225 --> 01:35:35,104
when truth exists
and what is done cannot be undone."

1529
01:35:38,482 --> 01:35:41,778
What everyone
is interested in is the evidence he has,

1530
01:35:41,861 --> 01:35:44,822
both in terms of the documents
on his computer

1531
01:35:44,905 --> 01:35:48,159
and the cell phone
that he was using at the time.

1532
01:35:49,160 --> 01:35:51,913
Two people connected
with the Russian doping program are dead

1533
01:35:51,996 --> 01:35:55,416
under circumstances
that seem highly suspect.

1534
01:35:55,499 --> 01:35:58,002
One of the first things
that I learned from authorities

1535
01:35:58,085 --> 01:35:59,837
when I came onto the case

1536
01:35:59,921 --> 01:36:04,091
was that the Russian government
has the resources and the will.

1537
01:36:04,175 --> 01:36:07,511
So we've had to develop
a very multi-stage protocol

1538
01:36:07,595 --> 01:36:11,348
to minimize the chances our conversations
will be intercepted.

1539
01:36:12,266 --> 01:36:14,768
The main concern
is that they would be able,

1540
01:36:14,852 --> 01:36:18,230
through those communications,
to try to triangulate his location,

1541
01:36:18,314 --> 01:36:23,569
and if they have agents
in the United States, then to do him harm.

1542
01:36:27,489 --> 01:36:29,116
We're 84 days away

1543
01:36:29,200 --> 01:36:31,911
till the Summer Games
in Rio de Janeiro in Brazil.

1544
01:36:32,494 --> 01:36:35,998
Until now, there's
only been hard evidence about athletics,

1545
01:36:36,082 --> 01:36:39,085
but this is pointing the finger
at a whole range of sports.

1546
01:36:43,797 --> 01:36:47,343
As you know, there's a Department
of Justice investigation going.

1547
01:36:47,426 --> 01:36:50,221
Grigory's been advised by his lawyer

1548
01:36:50,304 --> 01:36:53,515
he should not be here
for security reasons.

1549
01:36:55,226 --> 01:36:58,020
I worked with Grigory
over about six months

1550
01:36:58,104 --> 01:37:02,566
to compile a record
of what happened in Russia.

1551
01:37:03,650 --> 01:37:06,320
This is the spreadsheet
of every single athlete

1552
01:37:06,403 --> 01:37:09,323
that was on the state-mandated protocol.

1553
01:37:10,241 --> 01:37:13,035
What every single athlete was taking
in London,

1554
01:37:13,119 --> 01:37:15,537
including their sample numbers
and collection.

1555
01:37:16,080 --> 01:37:19,375
When Christiane goes back
and tests these samples correctly,

1556
01:37:19,458 --> 01:37:21,835
she will basically find them all positive.

1557
01:37:23,379 --> 01:37:26,840
And we have all their protocols
before the London Games.

1558
01:37:29,176 --> 01:37:32,346
We have the same for Beijing.

1559
01:37:33,014 --> 01:37:36,976
And this outlines
how Russia was collecting

1560
01:37:37,059 --> 01:37:40,729
thousands and thousands
of clean samples for swapping.

1561
01:37:40,812 --> 01:37:43,315
No, no, this we saw,
but we want to ask question

1562
01:37:43,399 --> 01:37:46,110
as well as how it was done,
understanding...

1563
01:37:46,193 --> 01:37:51,615
So, sodium chloride is added to the sample
to increase specific gravity.

1564
01:37:51,698 --> 01:37:53,825
Many of these samples are gonna have

1565
01:37:53,910 --> 01:37:58,705
a hundred times the sodium content
that should be in somebody's urine.

1566
01:37:58,789 --> 01:38:00,457
Let me make sure I understand.

1567
01:38:00,541 --> 01:38:04,461
They were taking the B
to be opened secretly?

1568
01:38:04,545 --> 01:38:05,629
Yes.

1569
01:38:05,712 --> 01:38:08,507
You said it was removed
after the Paralympic Games.

1570
01:38:08,590 --> 01:38:11,468
Does it mean that it happened
also for the Paralympic Games?

1571
01:38:11,552 --> 01:38:12,553
Yes, yes.

1572
01:38:12,636 --> 01:38:16,890
Both the Olympic and the Paralympic Games,
they swapped urine.

1573
01:38:17,891 --> 01:38:22,063
Vancouver was really the impetus
for the urine swapping operation.

1574
01:38:22,146 --> 01:38:23,940
They only won a handful of medals,

1575
01:38:24,023 --> 01:38:27,359
and to see to it that
that didn't happen again at Sochi.

1576
01:38:27,901 --> 01:38:29,903
We'll find that out when...

1577
01:38:29,987 --> 01:38:31,488
In terms of time-sensitive,

1578
01:38:31,572 --> 01:38:33,532
London is more sensitive,
in the sense that

1579
01:38:33,615 --> 01:38:35,576
these athletes are going
to the next Rio Games,

1580
01:38:35,659 --> 01:38:36,660
not the winter ones.

1581
01:38:36,743 --> 01:38:39,538
This is Sochi. This is London.
This is Beijing.

1582
01:38:39,621 --> 01:38:42,083
This goes all the way back to 1968.

1583
01:38:42,166 --> 01:38:46,128
There never was anti-doping in Russia.
Period. Ever.

1584
01:38:46,212 --> 01:38:47,671
Across all summer sports?

1585
01:38:47,754 --> 01:38:49,131
Every sport.

1586
01:38:49,631 --> 01:38:50,871
He's sorry?

1587
01:38:52,468 --> 01:38:54,095
- Who's that?
- Grigory.

1588
01:38:54,178 --> 01:38:55,721
I don't want to get into that.

1589
01:38:55,804 --> 01:38:59,558
Do you think, as a scientist,
I am happy to have been in Sochi?

1590
01:38:59,641 --> 01:39:03,187
And to everything...
We gave credibility to the lab.

1591
01:39:03,270 --> 01:39:05,647
Do you think that I feel good today?

1592
01:39:05,731 --> 01:39:08,900
Do you think that the athletes
who were cheated feel good?

1593
01:39:08,985 --> 01:39:12,989
As angry as you guys might be,
I think the one thing...

1594
01:39:14,991 --> 01:39:19,328
Grigory risked his life,
and is risking his life, to do this.

1595
01:39:19,411 --> 01:39:22,873
He left his wife behind,
he left his children behind,

1596
01:39:22,957 --> 01:39:26,669
he left all of his belongings behind,
all of his financial security behind.

1597
01:39:27,586 --> 01:39:30,131
We're here to get everything out.

1598
01:39:30,714 --> 01:39:31,714
Okay.

1599
01:39:33,175 --> 01:39:35,511
"Dear Mr. Fogel
and Dr. Rodchenkov,

1600
01:39:35,594 --> 01:39:37,429
the IOC has full confidence

1601
01:39:37,513 --> 01:39:39,931
in the authority
of Professor Richard McLaren

1602
01:39:40,016 --> 01:39:43,310
and respects his judgment
to ensure a comprehensive inquiry.

1603
01:39:43,394 --> 01:39:46,230
We will act swiftly
to take the necessary measures.

1604
01:39:46,313 --> 01:39:49,775
Sincerely yours, Thomas Bach. President."

1605
01:39:51,110 --> 01:39:53,654
Transferring you to Richard McLaren.

1606
01:39:55,281 --> 01:39:58,042
You speak of them as being
orders. Are they actually orders?

1607
01:39:58,117 --> 01:40:00,952
Nagornykh is ordering Grigory?
Or ordering the lab?

1608
01:40:01,037 --> 01:40:02,163
Does it matter?

1609
01:40:02,246 --> 01:40:05,916
Yes, Nagornykh is ordering Grigory.

1610
01:40:05,999 --> 01:40:10,629
There's e-mails, like,
explicitly about soccer players.

1611
01:40:10,712 --> 01:40:17,386
There's e-mails explicitly of,
you know, of weightlifters.

1612
01:40:18,804 --> 01:40:20,847
And that essentially were...

1613
01:40:20,931 --> 01:40:24,976
Of rowers, of swimmers...

1614
01:40:25,686 --> 01:40:27,854
where Grigory had found the positive.

1615
01:40:27,938 --> 01:40:31,108
Then if they are
concerned about it,

1616
01:40:31,192 --> 01:40:35,737
they find the right profile in the bank,
and pick that one out of the bank,

1617
01:40:35,821 --> 01:40:39,533
and they run the analysis on that one?

1618
01:40:39,616 --> 01:40:40,742
You got it.

1619
01:40:40,826 --> 01:40:41,827
I see.

1620
01:40:42,453 --> 01:40:44,913
If this all can be proved,
it's quite mind-blowing.

1621
01:40:45,497 --> 01:40:48,042
- The sooner I have it, the better.
- Okay.

1622
01:40:48,584 --> 01:40:51,253
It's important
to a lot of people around the world.

1623
01:40:52,588 --> 01:40:54,268
- We do it now?
- Yes.

1624
01:41:07,811 --> 01:41:11,523
Russian athletes could not credibly
return to international competition

1625
01:41:11,607 --> 01:41:17,654
without undermining the confidence
of their competitors and the public.

1626
01:41:18,697 --> 01:41:21,908
They are the pride and joy
of Russian sport.

1627
01:41:21,992 --> 01:41:25,996
But track and field stars,
like pole-vaulter Yelena Isinbayeva,

1628
01:41:26,079 --> 01:41:29,291
won't be going for gold
at next month's Rio Olympics,

1629
01:41:29,375 --> 01:41:32,294
despite having friends in high places.

1630
01:41:37,133 --> 01:41:40,093
This is truly important to us, because...

1631
01:41:53,064 --> 01:41:56,943
Today, our track and field team
finds itself in a dire situation.

1632
01:41:57,027 --> 01:41:59,488
We have been banned from the Olympics

1633
01:41:59,571 --> 01:42:02,408
very aggressively,
without any evidence or proof.

1634
01:42:07,120 --> 01:42:10,291
Rodchenkov,
director of the Moscow WADA lab,

1635
01:42:10,374 --> 01:42:12,626
was forced to resign from his position

1636
01:42:12,709 --> 01:42:17,339
even though, when you think about it,
he was a brilliant doctor.

1637
01:42:17,839 --> 01:42:22,261
So he's fired, and then somehow
ends up in the United States,

1638
01:42:22,344 --> 01:42:25,306
where he subsequently took his story
to The New York Times.

1639
01:42:25,389 --> 01:42:28,684
Not exactly the smallest paper on Earth.

1640
01:42:28,767 --> 01:42:30,769
He gets there,
he turns over all this information.

1641
01:42:31,353 --> 01:42:34,356
Finally, he stated
that the entire doping program

1642
01:42:34,440 --> 01:42:36,608
was in fact part of a state-run system.

1643
01:42:36,692 --> 01:42:39,903
Whatever he claims,

1644
01:42:40,654 --> 01:42:43,324
he is confusing himself
with the government.

1645
01:42:44,200 --> 01:42:48,370
You see, all of his claims against
the government, he did himself.

1646
01:42:48,454 --> 01:42:50,121
It was a solo act.

1647
01:42:50,206 --> 01:42:53,459
So the swapping,
the destruction of samples,

1648
01:42:53,542 --> 01:42:55,836
this was all just a farce?

1649
01:42:55,919 --> 01:42:58,755
Again, I just don't see
how this is possible. How could it be?

1650
01:42:58,839 --> 01:43:00,131
Please let me repeat,

1651
01:43:00,216 --> 01:43:03,552
these allegations are not facts,
just rumors and speculations.

1652
01:43:06,513 --> 01:43:08,616
Welcome
to the McLaren Independent Commission

1653
01:43:08,640 --> 01:43:10,309
news conference here in Toronto.

1654
01:43:11,352 --> 01:43:15,606
In May, Professor McLaren was mandated
by the World Anti-Doping Agency

1655
01:43:15,689 --> 01:43:17,733
with respect to the allegations made

1656
01:43:17,816 --> 01:43:21,320
by the former director
of the WADA-accredited Moscow laboratory,

1657
01:43:21,403 --> 01:43:23,572
Dr. Grigory Rodchenkov.

1658
01:43:25,198 --> 01:43:29,661
The investigation has established
the findings set out in the report

1659
01:43:29,745 --> 01:43:31,622
beyond a reasonable doubt.

1660
01:43:32,206 --> 01:43:33,916
Our experts were to determine

1661
01:43:33,999 --> 01:43:38,086
if samples had scratches and marks
on the inside of the bottle caps,

1662
01:43:38,169 --> 01:43:41,298
representative of a tool used
to open the cap.

1663
01:43:42,549 --> 01:43:45,636
Of the set of samples suspected
of being swapped...

1664
01:43:47,220 --> 01:43:48,764
we were able to confirm...

1665
01:43:50,432 --> 01:43:53,310
100% had evidence of tampering.

1666
01:43:55,437 --> 01:43:57,814
We've conducted cyber
and forensic analysis,

1667
01:43:57,898 --> 01:43:59,858
secured data from hard drives,

1668
01:43:59,941 --> 01:44:03,111
and reviewed thousands of pages
of documents.

1669
01:44:03,945 --> 01:44:09,075
The Moscow laboratory operated for
the protection of doped Russian athletes

1670
01:44:09,701 --> 01:44:13,955
within a state-directed, fail-safe system.

1671
01:44:16,082 --> 01:44:20,462
Ministry of Sport,
Deputy Minister of Sport Yuri Nagornykh,

1672
01:44:20,546 --> 01:44:24,007
RUSADA, that's the anti-doping agency
in Russia,

1673
01:44:24,090 --> 01:44:27,553
and the former director
of the Moscow testing laboratory

1674
01:44:27,636 --> 01:44:30,096
were all involved in this operation

1675
01:44:30,681 --> 01:44:33,475
with the active participation
and assistance

1676
01:44:33,559 --> 01:44:37,521
of the Russian Federal Security Service,
formerly known as the KGB.

1677
01:44:38,397 --> 01:44:41,900
The FSB, who had access to the Sochi lab

1678
01:44:41,983 --> 01:44:44,235
under the guise
of the building maintenance contractor,

1679
01:44:44,320 --> 01:44:46,530
can be identified in the evidence we have.

1680
01:44:47,030 --> 01:44:48,574
Alex Mihailovich, RT.

1681
01:44:48,657 --> 01:44:53,370
Rodchenkov himself is a person who's
under investigation in Russia currently.

1682
01:44:53,454 --> 01:44:54,996
He took off from Russia.

1683
01:44:55,080 --> 01:44:58,083
He seems to be a character
that you really can't rely on,

1684
01:44:58,166 --> 01:45:00,961
and a lot of this relies on Rodchenkov.

1685
01:45:01,044 --> 01:45:03,339
Does this compromise your work?

1686
01:45:03,422 --> 01:45:06,091
He is a person in this investigation,

1687
01:45:06,174 --> 01:45:08,677
but not the only person
in this investigation.

1688
01:45:09,260 --> 01:45:13,974
I can say without a doubt,
Dr. Rodchenkov is telling the truth

1689
01:45:14,057 --> 01:45:16,477
and was a truthful witness.

1690
01:45:16,560 --> 01:45:18,729
I was able to corroborate that

1691
01:45:18,812 --> 01:45:21,815
because of all the scientific
and forensic information.

1692
01:45:22,858 --> 01:45:28,780
My team can demonstrate the existence
of this system beyond a reasonable doubt.

1693
01:45:42,753 --> 01:45:45,464
It was clear
from Richard McLaren's report

1694
01:45:45,547 --> 01:45:48,091
that was contained
in our independent commission,

1695
01:45:48,174 --> 01:45:50,677
it's proven that offenses were committed.

1696
01:45:50,761 --> 01:45:55,098
So, I don't think anybody can accuse us
of sitting back and doing nothing.

1697
01:46:00,270 --> 01:46:02,606
President Putin condemned the findings,

1698
01:46:02,689 --> 01:46:05,484
saying the world is seeing
a dangerous recurrence

1699
01:46:05,567 --> 01:46:07,193
of politics interfering in sport.

1700
01:46:07,903 --> 01:46:09,279
Russia's government says

1701
01:46:09,362 --> 01:46:13,867
any decision which collectively punishes
its competitors is unacceptable.

1702
01:46:13,950 --> 01:46:15,619
Richard Conway, BBC News.

1703
01:46:41,144 --> 01:46:43,439
I'm gonna be rolling your hands
like that.

1704
01:46:43,522 --> 01:46:45,882
Let me do all of the work.
It makes it easier for everybody.

1705
01:46:47,943 --> 01:46:50,046
What were you all doing today?

1706
01:46:50,070 --> 01:46:51,572
We were worrying all day.

1707
01:46:51,655 --> 01:46:54,575
But today,
I was paying for everything, bills, etc.

1708
01:46:54,658 --> 01:46:56,785
Nika, we will get through this.

1709
01:46:56,868 --> 01:46:58,328
Oh, you have new glasses!

1710
01:46:59,079 --> 01:47:00,288
Not that new.

1711
01:47:01,790 --> 01:47:04,000
I have some sad news to tell you.

1712
01:47:04,626 --> 01:47:05,626
Yes?

1713
01:47:07,463 --> 01:47:09,881
I am going
into the witness protection program.

1714
01:47:09,965 --> 01:47:11,257
- You are?
- Mm-hmm.

1715
01:47:13,469 --> 01:47:14,803
Why?

1716
01:47:14,886 --> 01:47:18,682
Because the current situation is unclear.

1717
01:47:21,017 --> 01:47:22,811
- So, this is serious?
- Yes.

1718
01:47:23,562 --> 01:47:24,813
For a while?

1719
01:47:30,486 --> 01:47:32,571
I was thinking of you yesterday.

1720
01:47:32,654 --> 01:47:34,114
Well, visa is just one thing, but...

1721
01:47:34,197 --> 01:47:37,158
You are my bride
and keeper of the family and the dogs.

1722
01:47:37,242 --> 01:47:41,997
Grigory, I was worrying all day,
and on top of that, trying to reach you.

1723
01:47:42,080 --> 01:47:43,160
Don't tell anyone anything.

1724
01:47:43,749 --> 01:47:46,960
Who would I even tell?
I don't see much of anyone these days.

1725
01:47:47,043 --> 01:47:52,465
Maybe they'll pay off some officials
to sit in prison for some time?

1726
01:47:52,549 --> 01:47:55,176
As a formality.

1727
01:47:55,260 --> 01:47:57,053
I have to get going.

1728
01:47:58,179 --> 01:47:59,848
- Veronika?
- Yes?

1729
01:47:59,931 --> 01:48:06,437
You wrote down the lawyer's contact
information and have everything?

1730
01:48:07,439 --> 01:48:08,940
You know what I'm talking about?

1731
01:48:12,736 --> 01:48:16,072
Of course I understand.
It's just... This is all so sad.

1732
01:48:29,502 --> 01:48:32,631
Whatever packing
you need to do and getting dressed...

1733
01:48:32,714 --> 01:48:34,090
Okay. Okay.

1734
01:48:51,316 --> 01:48:54,027
So, do we know
what, uh, you're gonna be able to...

1735
01:48:54,110 --> 01:48:57,989
I still don't know
how it will be organized.

1736
01:48:58,073 --> 01:49:01,785
"Protection" means protection
that you don't know how it's organized.

1737
01:49:03,620 --> 01:49:05,914
What do you foresee at this point?

1738
01:49:07,791 --> 01:49:09,626
I will start writing book.

1739
01:49:10,836 --> 01:49:12,713
Oh, we are on the first floor.

1740
01:49:13,589 --> 01:49:14,756
Where is the exit?

1741
01:49:21,512 --> 01:49:24,474
I wonder when I'm going to see you again.

1742
01:49:25,809 --> 01:49:27,978
Don't worry. I'll be back.

1743
01:49:32,315 --> 01:49:36,778
Bryan,
you are medium-sized monster!

1744
01:49:36,862 --> 01:49:38,154
Remember me.

1745
01:49:58,174 --> 01:50:02,888
We have decided today
that Russian athletes can compete in Rio.

1746
01:50:06,599 --> 01:50:09,185
The International Sports
Federations

1747
01:50:09,269 --> 01:50:13,940
will carry out individual analysis,
taking into account...

1748
01:50:20,196 --> 01:50:23,283
Anti-doping officials are fuming.

1749
01:50:23,366 --> 01:50:26,912
The IOC going against the World
Anti-Doping Agency recommendations...

1750
01:50:33,669 --> 01:50:36,629
Olympic champion.
Vlasov had won gold again.

1751
01:50:59,235 --> 01:51:03,156
"Winston sank his arms
to his sides

1752
01:51:03,239 --> 01:51:06,076
and slowly refilled his lungs with air.

1753
01:51:12,165 --> 01:51:16,169
His mind slid away into
the labyrinthine world of doublethink.

1754
01:51:18,046 --> 01:51:20,423
To know and not to know,

1755
01:51:20,506 --> 01:51:26,096
to be conscious of complete truthfulness
while telling carefully constructed lies."

1756
01:51:26,888 --> 01:51:27,888
Thomas Bach.

1757
01:51:27,931 --> 01:51:31,226
"To repudiate morality
while laying claim to it.

1758
01:51:37,565 --> 01:51:40,986
To forget whatever
it was necessary to forget..."

1759
01:51:42,612 --> 01:51:45,949
Join and support
our fight for fair play.

1760
01:51:46,032 --> 01:51:50,871
Respect the rules, play fair, be clean.

1761
01:51:52,080 --> 01:51:54,374
"Then to draw it back
into memory again

1762
01:51:54,457 --> 01:51:56,709
at the moment when it was needed..."

1763
01:51:56,793 --> 01:51:59,712
This decision is about justice.

1764
01:51:59,796 --> 01:52:03,299
Justice has to be independent
from politics.

1765
01:52:05,010 --> 01:52:06,636
Hurrah!

1766
01:52:06,719 --> 01:52:09,514
Hurrah!

1767
01:52:09,597 --> 01:52:12,142
"And then promptly
to forget it again."

1768
01:52:17,688 --> 01:52:20,483
Fails a drug test,
is stripped of the gold medal...

1769
01:52:20,566 --> 01:52:24,737
"and above all, to apply
the same process to the process itself."

1770
01:52:24,821 --> 01:52:26,715
Trying to make sure
your testimony's clear.

1771
01:52:26,739 --> 01:52:31,036
How many times do I have to say it?
I've never taken drugs. How clear is that?

1772
01:52:31,119 --> 01:52:33,496
Okay. I think it's clear.

1773
01:52:33,579 --> 01:52:36,082
"And if all others
accepted the lie,

1774
01:52:36,166 --> 01:52:39,127
then the lie passed into history
and became truth."

1775
01:52:40,420 --> 01:52:42,630
We've never had
a doping program in Russia.

1776
01:52:42,713 --> 01:52:47,260
This is just impossible, unthinkable.
We would never do something like that.

1777
01:52:47,343 --> 01:52:50,847
I don't even recall the name
of that citizen who defected,

1778
01:52:50,931 --> 01:52:55,268
the one who ran
the Russian anti-doping lab.

1779
01:52:55,351 --> 01:52:57,979
"Even to understand the word 'doublethink'

1780
01:52:58,063 --> 01:53:00,606
involves the use of doublethink."

1781
01:53:00,690 --> 01:53:03,734
We are now able to put
the findings of the first report

1782
01:53:03,819 --> 01:53:05,904
into sharper and clearer focus.

1783
01:53:05,987 --> 01:53:11,242
I can confirm, for years,
that spectators have been deceived.

1784
01:53:12,202 --> 01:53:13,744
The desire to win medals

1785
01:53:13,829 --> 01:53:18,249
superseded their collective moral
and ethical compass, and Olympic values...

1786
01:53:18,333 --> 01:53:20,668
I was doing
in parallel two things

1787
01:53:20,751 --> 01:53:24,714
which canceled out each other
in being fully contradictory.

1788
01:53:30,303 --> 01:53:31,930
Doping and anti-doping.

1789
01:53:36,684 --> 01:53:40,105
It was pure, exact doublethink.

1790
01:53:44,817 --> 01:53:46,444
I was like a slave.

1791
01:53:49,906 --> 01:53:51,574
Slavery was my freedom...

1792
01:53:56,579 --> 01:53:57,914
till the end.

1793
01:54:11,511 --> 01:54:12,637
So...

1794
01:54:17,142 --> 01:54:18,142
truth.
