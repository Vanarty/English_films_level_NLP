1
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:26,403
If you must blink, do it now.

2
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,648
Pay careful attention
to everything you see and hear,

3
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,131
no matter how unusual it may seem.

4
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,005
And please be warned,

5
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:35,400
if you fidget, if you look away,

6
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:38,520
if you forget any part of what I tell you,

7
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,568
even for an instant,

8
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,926
then our hero will surely perish.

9
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,640
His name is Kubo.

10
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,246
His grandfather stole something from him.

11
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,040
And that really is the least of it.

12
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,481
Ow!

13
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,280
Well, hello, Kubo.

14
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,805
How was it today?

15
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,840
It wasn't a bad crowd.

16
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,320
I got two pennies and a lint ball.

17
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,084
This is pretty good lint.

18
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,524
And what have you got planned for today?

19
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,440
Oh, you know, the usual.

20
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,010
- Monsters?
- Of course.

21
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,442
You think you can work
in a fire-breathing chicken?

22
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,571
The chicken again?

23
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,320
The chicken is funny.

24
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:38,280
A touch of comedy to balance
the whole thing out.

25
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:41,640
They're gonna be throwing money
at you. I just know it.

26
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,720
Uh, they'll throw something at you.
I don't know.

27
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,080
Okay, I'll see what I can do.

28
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,448
And do you plan on finishing
the story this time, young man?

29
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,447
If you must blink, do it now.

30
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,801
Yay!

31
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,680
Pay careful attention to
everything you see and hear,

32
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:19,001
no matter how unusual it may seem.

33
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:24,000
And please be warned,
if you fidget, if you look away,

34
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,160
if you forget any part of what I tell you,

35
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:31,446
even for an instant,
then our hero will surely perish.

36
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:41,160
Hanzo was a mighty samurai,
but he was alone.

37
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:44,767
His family taken from him,
his kingdom in ruins,

38
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,120
and his army destroyed
by the dreaded Moon King.

39
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,920
You may recall, Hanzo was
roaming the distant Far Lands

40
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,240
in search of a magical suit of armor.

41
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,280
The only weapon in the whole world

42
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,966
that could protect him
from the power of the Moon King.

43
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:03,120
This armor was made up of three pieces.

44
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,280
- The first...
- Oh! I know! I know!

45
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,771
The sword unbreakable.

46
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,240
The second...

47
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,840
The breastplate...

48
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,240
Impenetrable.

49
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,640
Impenetra-bubble!

50
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,085
Yeah!

51
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:26,560
And finally, the third weapon,
the final piece of the armor...

52
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,920
I know this one. Pick me!

53
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,320
The helmet invulnerable!

54
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,920
Before Hanzo could claim the armor

55
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,080
and unite the pieces
to reveal their true power,

56
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,481
he was attacked by the Moon King's beast.

57
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,166
Oh, yes!

58
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,529
Kill the chicken! Rip it to pieces.

59
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,845
Oh, my.

60
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:29,320
Hanzo was filled with rage.

61
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:33,251
His soul tormented by the grief
of a family stolen from him!

62
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:44,281
At last, our hero was face-to-face
with his nemesis, the Moon King.

63
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,403
So, be sure to come back tomorrow.

64
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:02,440
What? Oh, come on!

65
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,760
People like an ending.

66
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,880
Where are you going?

67
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,770
No, you can't... You can't leave!

68
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,681
Kubo.

69
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,322
- Kubo.
- Yes, Mother.

70
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,446
I'm here.

71
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,806
Hungry?

72
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,600
And even though he could barely see

73
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:43,729
his own hand in front of his face,

74
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,800
Hanzo and his army of loyal samurai

75
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,769
pressed on through the blizzard.

76
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:55,767
And suddenly, as quickly
as it had started,

77
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,640
the storm cleared before him.

78
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,960
Hanzo breathed a sigh of relief,
for he was home.

79
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,200
His fortress?

80
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,800
- The Beetle Clan castle!
- Yes.

81
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:08,200
At the very edge of the Far Lands,

82
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:11,204
hidden from the Moon King
by powerful magic.

83
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14,201
And then what happened,
when he got to the castle?

84
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,120
When who got to the castle?

85
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,725
Hanzo! My father!

86
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,649
Hanzo... Hanzo was at the castle?

87
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,124
He...

88
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:28,205
Just give me a second. I'm...

89
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,560
No.

90
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:33,211
It's gone. I can't...

91
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,481
I'm sorry, Kubo.

92
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,680
Perhaps I could recall a different story.

93
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:44,287
Mother, what was Father like?

94
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,080
Oh.

95
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,400
This one is easy.

96
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:54,000
Hanzo was a mighty warrior,
skilled with sword and bow.

97
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:56,960
No, what was he really like?

98
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,442
When he wasn't fighting,
when he was with us.

99
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:05,127
He was just like you.

100
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,604
- Like me?
- Yes.

101
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,003
Strong, and clever, and funny,

102
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,880
and, oh, so handsome.

103
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:16,361
- Ugh. Mother.
- Come on!

104
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:22,080
Never forget how much he loved you, Kubo.

105
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,891
He died protecting us.

106
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,960
- Did the Moon King...
- Uh.

107
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,405
Your grandfather.

108
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:34,040
Did Grandfather and your sisters
really kill my father?

109
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,880
It can't be true, can it?

110
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,080
They're family.

111
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,040
No, they are monsters.

112
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,400
Grandfather and my sisters
stole your eye, Kubo.

113
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,324
They must never find you again. Never!

114
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,720
You must always stay hidden
from the night sky,

115
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:50,880
or they will find you
and they'll take you away from me.

116
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:54,160
Promise me you will never let this happen.

117
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,049
Promise me, Kubo!

118
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,730
Don't be sad, Kubo.

119
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,800
Kubo?

120
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,770
Remember what you must do, Kubo?

121
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,527
Remember?

122
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:15,360
Keep you with me at all times, Mr. Monkey.

123
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,441
And?

124
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:20,800
And keep Father's robe
on my back at all times.

125
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,006
Yes, Kubo.

126
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,130
And there's one more thing.

127
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:30,521
Never, ever stay out after dark.

128
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:32,561
Huh?

129
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,887
Remember?

130
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:38,280
- Yes, Mr. Monkey.
- Good boy.

131
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,166
Bedtime.

132
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,360
Mother, wake up. You're dreaming.

133
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,602
No. Kubo.

134
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,200
Kubo, is that you?

135
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,964
Yes, Mother. I'm here.

136
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:10,170
Kubo, what happened to your eye?

137
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,130
Paper boy!

138
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,840
Here, here!

139
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,045
Come on. Come on.

140
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,323
Come sit next to me.
I got us a good spot here.

141
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,120
What do you think?

142
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,170
I got myself all spruced up
for the big day.

143
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,560
Mmm.

144
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,080
I do so love the festival.

145
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,640
A time to celebrate.

146
00:17:56,920 --> 00:18:00,400
You know, it's a shame
you never stay past sundown.

147
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,484
There's fireworks,
and singing, and dancing,

148
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,120
and feasting, of course.

149
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,362
But the best part of all...

150
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,880
Do you see those lamps and altars?

151
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:16,171
We use those to speak to
the loved ones that left us behind.

152
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,640
We listen to their tales,

153
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:22,800
and guide their safe return
to the blissful pure land.

154
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,928
Really? Did you speak to someone?

155
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,769
Yes, I did. My husband.

156
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:30,080
His voice was as clear and loud

157
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,920
as the one you use for your stories.

158
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,360
In 72 years, he never had a thing to say.

159
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,046
Now he's gone, I can't shut him up.

160
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,960
You have someone you wanna talk to, huh?

161
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,080
Very much.

162
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,720
Well, what's stopping you?

163
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,200
Don't I need a lamp?

164
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:52,760
Well, I'll bet you could make
a really nice one

165
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:56,322
with that paper folding thing you do.

166
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:00,800
You see, not just a pretty face, huh?

167
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:01,927
Now, hurry along.

168
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:05,160
Go! There's still time before dark.

169
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,890
Go! Get out of here.

170
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:43,447
Place the lamp at the altar.

171
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,400
Very good.

172
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,080
What do we do next, Daddy?

173
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,760
Now we pray.

174
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:52,200
We ask her spirit
to honor us with its light.

175
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,880
Grandma, will you please honor...

176
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,246
Shh.

177
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,963
Softly, softly.

178
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:19,124
Hello, Father. I hope you're well.

179
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:24,522
I mean, I know you're dead,
but I hope everything is okay.

180
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,324
Look, it's your robe.

181
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:34,044
Mother says I'll grow into it.

182
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:39,920
She says you were a great leader
who died protecting me.

183
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,440
Saving one of my eyes.

184
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:45,524
Two would have been ideal,
but thanks anyway.

185
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:51,640
Father, I'm worried about Mother.

186
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:55,088
With every day that goes by,
she drifts further away.

187
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:59,247
She talks a lot about you, but...

188
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,440
But I just don't know.

189
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:04,251
I don't think she remembers
what's real anymore.

190
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,687
I don't know what's real anymore.

191
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:11,120
I just wish you were here,

192
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:15,680
so I could talk to you, see you,

193
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,200
find out what I should do.

194
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,880
Daddy, Daddy, she's here! Grandma is here!

195
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:22,645
Now it's time for the final part.

196
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:25,440
We have to help her
get back to the spirit world.

197
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,205
But she just got here.

198
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:30,522
Come on.

199
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,931
Father? Hello?

200
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,051
Anytime.

201
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,725
Fine!

202
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,123
I don't need you anyway.

203
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,003
Kubo.

204
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,240
I'm sorry.

205
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,327
Kubo.

206
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,726
Kubo.

207
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,320
Little boy.

208
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,560
What happened to your eye?

209
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,928
Who are you? How do you know my name?

210
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,320
We are your family, Kubo.

211
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,880
Your mother's sisters.

212
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:35,885
And we've been looking
for you for so long.

213
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:39,842
It's so lovely to meet you, Kubo.

214
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,600
Face-to-face.

215
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:50,406
Come, Kubo. Come to your aunties.

216
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:54,600
No reason to be afraid, Kubo.

217
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,682
We just need your other eye.

218
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,124
Your grandfather admires it so.

219
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,561
Help! Help!

220
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,640
Somebody help!

221
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,643
Help! Look out!

222
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,570
Run!

223
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:59,680
We're here, Kubo.

224
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,001
Your family has come for you.

225
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:15,881
Kubo.

226
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:17,521
Mother.

227
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,760
Kubo, you must find the armor.
It's your only chance.

228
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,200
Remember this.

229
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:42,168
Mother! Mother! No!

230
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:45,601
Mother!

231
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,811
Kubo.

232
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,481
Kubo!

233
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,960
Can you hear me, Kubo?

234
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,800
I said your mother is gone.

235
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,850
Your village is destroyed.
Burned to the ground.

236
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,002
We landed here in the Far Lands.

237
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,930
Your enemies aren't far behind.

238
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:27,002
We must search for shelter
before your grandfather comes.

239
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:35,042
We need to go now.

240
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,002
Come on, get up, let's go.

241
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,680
Once we're inside,

242
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:21,162
you might be tempted
to complain about the odor.

243
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:30,405
Keep in mind my sense of smell
is 10 times stronger than yours.

244
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,009
You have questions, I can tell.

245
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,965
- Who...
- You get three.

246
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,569
I think I have more.

247
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:18,247
Three, but first you're gonna eat.

248
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,250
Why only three?

249
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,560
- Okay, that was your first question.
- What?

250
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,051
I don't understand what's happening!

251
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:24,971
Who are you?

252
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,724
You don't recognize me?

253
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:34,325
All these years, you had
to keep me in your pack.

254
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,640
Well, now you know why.

255
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,720
But you were a wooden charm.

256
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:40,600
You were this big.

257
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:43,763
I called that charm "Mr. Monkey."

258
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:46,720
And if I were alive at that point,
I might have found that insulting.

259
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:50,560
Look, your mother used the last
of her magic to save you

260
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,210
and bring me to life.

261
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:04,605
Here. Drink.

262
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:12,160
- It smells.
- Everything in here smells.

263
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,560
- Drink it.
- I don't want it.

264
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,847
I said drink it.

265
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,760
You're a mean monkey, aren't you?

266
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,320
Yes. Yes, I am. And that's three.

267
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,323
You're out of questions now,
so just listen.

268
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:24,320
I'm here to protect you, Kubo.

269
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,760
And that means you have to do as I say.

270
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:29,200
So, if you don't eat, you'll be weak.

271
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:30,880
If you're weak, you'll be slow.

272
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,644
If you're slow, you'll die.

273
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,531
It's too hot!

274
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:46,921
Drink.

275
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,970
Oh, excuse me.

276
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:14,080
Okay, you better start
taking this seriously, Kubo.

277
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:16,606
This is real. This is not a story.

278
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:20,640
Those things, your aunts,
they never get hungry.

279
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,840
They never sleep.

280
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,410
They will find you!

281
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:26,920
And if we're not prepared,

282
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,243
they'll kill me and take your other eye.

283
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,606
What are we gonna do?

284
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,280
We're going to find the armor.

285
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:40,727
It's the only thing that can protect you.

286
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,083
So it's real. Really real.

287
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,007
Don't worry. I'm not going to keep it.

288
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,689
I pulled that from her head.

289
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:04,721
I didn't mean to.

290
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:07,560
Your mother was very powerful.

291
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:09,005
She blessed your robes

292
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:12,528
so that when the need was most,
they would fly you away.

293
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:15,803
She used the last of that power
to bring me to life.

294
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:19,480
This bracelet, her hair, it's a memory.

295
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:22,086
And memories are powerful things, Kubo.

296
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,766
Never lose it.

297
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:29,961
One more question?

298
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:31,960
Last one.

299
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,485
Do you know where it is?

300
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,166
The armor?

301
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:38,326
No. No, I don't.

302
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,649
Now, go to sleep.

303
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:54,490
Goodnight, Monkey.

304
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,201
Kubo.

305
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,120
Kubo.

306
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,929
You were talking in your sleep.

307
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:22,120
You were dreaming,
calling out to your father,

308
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:27,241
and then the paper flew out of your
bag and folded itself into him.

309
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:35,040
He's been standing there
for hours, quietly judging us.

310
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:41,965
I'm not even convinced
this counts as origami.

311
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:46,046
I could swear scissors were involved.

312
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:47,721
Ow.

313
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:52,280
Back home in the cave,
my mother's dreams did this,

314
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:56,001
and the paper always unfolded
itself by morning.

315
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:07,690
What's that about?

316
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:23,645
What are you doing?

317
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:32,323
I guess this is how my father answered me.

318
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,920
I'm tempted to say
that entrusting our fate

319
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,440
to the guidance of a small paper man

320
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:39,965
seems like a bad idea.

321
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:43,564
But it's the best bad idea we have.

322
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,410
You're growing stronger.

323
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,887
You might not wanna look
quite so pleased about that.

324
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:22,047
We grow stronger,
the world grows more dangerous.

325
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:24,488
Life has a funny way
of keeping things balanced.

326
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:28,002
Monkey, do you ever say
anything encouraging?

327
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:31,362
I encourage you not to die.

328
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,402
"I encourage you not to die."

329
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:05,131
Mosquitoes. Annoying.

330
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:30,170
Wasn't me, I swear.

331
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:35,080
Paper runs out, as does patience.

332
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,730
I didn't ask them to do that.

333
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:39,965
The second time.

334
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:43,480
I didn't! At least, not exactly.

335
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:45,160
I mean, I felt it, but...

336
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:47,200
Magic is not meant to be easy.

337
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,960
You need to learn control.

338
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:52,647
Concentrate on what you're doing,
and always remember,

339
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,121
don't mess with the monkey.

340
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,770
Tread carefully, Kubo.
This isn't one of your stories.

341
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,320
How do you know? Maybe it is.

342
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,920
And I'm the valiant hero
and you're the mean monkey.

343
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,400
Heroes come and go.

344
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:24,768
Any moment, something terrible
could come out of nowhere and...

345
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,040
Monkey!

346
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,406
Kubo!

347
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:42,810
Monkey, wait.

348
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,848
He wasn't trying to hurt me.

349
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,051
He just wanted...

350
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,525
- Hanzo.
- Hanzo?

351
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,281
Hanzo.

352
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:59,200
I still think I'm gonna stab him.

353
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,520
Why must you always assume the worst?

354
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:05,080
Oh! Oh! Pardon me for not trusting
this giant, spiky, insect-monster

355
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:06,280
that just kidnapped you.

356
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:09,120
Hanzo. Yes, I remember him.

357
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,771
I think, maybe, he was my master.

358
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,725
What? What did you say?

359
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:17,445
We had a crest. A samurai crest.

360
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:27,242
Have you seen this crest before?

361
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:34,280
This is a miracle.

362
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:36,000
You have our robes.

363
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:38,924
You're wearing our robes!

364
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,200
Why are you wearing our robes?

365
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,640
He doesn't have to answer your questions.

366
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,085
Anyway, who are you?

367
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,521
Many years ago, I was cursed.

368
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:51,925
Trapped in this cursed state.

369
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:55,840
Cursed to wander the Far Lands.

370
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:58,287
Cursed or curs-ed.

371
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,760
No comrades, no master.

372
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:04,411
Not even a name or a single memory

373
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,720
of the noble warrior I once was.

374
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,960
You used to be a man?

375
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:11,610
No, not just any man.

376
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,125
A samurai.

377
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,762
I mean, I'm pretty certain.

378
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:17,520
Look, I had the stuff.

379
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:20,040
I mean, I'm either a samurai
or a really bad hoarder.

380
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:24,205
Either way, inside my thorax
beats the heart of a warrior.

381
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:28,286
If you have no memory,
how can you be certain of anything?

382
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,489
Because I get flashes.

383
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:35,129
They come about from objects
I find on my travels.

384
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,530
Sometimes it's a sound.

385
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,285
Or a smell.

386
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,400
You must get a lot of flashes.

387
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,360
The memories, they fade.

388
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:46,329
And all I'm left with
is the sense that I was

389
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:49,611
once part of something much greater.

390
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:51,480
Monkey, can I tell him?

391
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:53,000
I really don't think that's a good idea.

392
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:54,969
- He has a right.
- Absolutely not.

393
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:56,680
- But... I...
- No "buts." No!

394
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,720
- What? Tell me what?
- Hanzo was my father.

395
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,484
Kubo!

396
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:01,806
This is a miracle.

397
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,804
I have found the son of my master.

398
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:09,043
- Don't even.
- Oh.

399
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:13,280
Whatever brings you to these lands,
whatever your quest,

400
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:15,442
it is now my quest, too.

401
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:20,120
I will join you, and I will give
my life for you, if necessary.

402
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:21,929
Wow. You will?

403
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:25,200
What? Do you think that's possible?

404
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:28,600
Look, kid, I mean, I know how these
quests go. People die all the time.

405
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:31,160
They drop like flies. That doesn't matter.

406
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:35,560
'Cause I have a feeling
this is my destiny.

407
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:37,080
No, it isn't!

408
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:38,969
We can't trust anything you say,

409
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:41,560
because you can't trust anything you say.

410
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:44,160
We don't know anything about you.

411
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:47,040
Monkey, you said it yourself.

412
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:49,440
Our quest is a difficult one.

413
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:54,606
A samurai, even a cursed one
with no memory, that looks like a bug,

414
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:55,880
could be helpful.

415
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:58,760
Yes, I am certain I could be helpful.

416
00:40:58,840 --> 00:40:59,800
Indispensable.

417
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:01,564
In what way?

418
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:13,322
Firing an arrow into a wall
is hardly what I call...

419
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:17,920
Impressive.

420
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:18,967
Oh, look at that.

421
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:20,640
Literally, the first time
I've ever done it.

422
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,404
Just tell me of our quest,

423
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:26,764
and I will quickly demonstrate
my numerous indispensabilities.

424
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:29,720
Well, that's kind of a long story.

425
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,641
You've got my attention.
I promise I won't even blink.

426
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:34,649
I actually don't think I even can blink.

427
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:36,320
- Do I have eyelids?
- Fine.

428
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,801
Walk and talk. Hanzo has found a path.

429
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:04,080
So, you used to be a toy monkey.

430
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:07,482
Kubo, I really don't see
how this part is important to our story.

431
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:11,560
I kept her in my pocket.
She was only like this big.

432
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:12,880
- Okay, Kubo, that's enough.
- Tiny.

433
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,689
And she was called "Mr. Monkey."

434
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:17,480
I wasn't a toy. I was a charm.

435
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:19,801
Of course you were.

436
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:43,006
That doesn't look good.

437
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:46,810
Don't touch anything.

438
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:55,606
He did it.

439
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:16,560
Okay.

440
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:27,040
No. No. No.

441
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:32,887
Yes.

442
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:37,804
Kubo, look.

443
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:44,723
The sword unbreakable.

444
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:47,600
It could be a trap.

445
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:49,560
Allow me.

446
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:52,040
What, it's not a trap if you do it?

447
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:54,646
Stealth is my middle name.

448
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:58,480
You don't even have a first name.

449
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:00,369
Don't worry. I got this.

450
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:10,320
The mighty Beetle is victorious!

451
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:40,400
I don't got this.

452
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:41,480
I don't got this!

453
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:43,050
Oh, for crying out loud!

454
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:46,284
I invoke the sword unbreakable!

455
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:49,720
It broke.

456
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:52,770
So, does it just mean the handle or...

457
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:55,480
I'm a little disappointed
with this magic sword.

458
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:57,767
It's not the right sword, you idiot!

459
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:04,481
Look!

460
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:08,120
The sword! It's in his head.

461
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:11,640
Hey! I've got a bone to pick with you.

462
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:14,720
See, because he's made of bones.

463
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:16,290
You're an embarrassment.

464
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:18,967
Uh...

465
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:20,720
This is problematic.

466
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:31,485
Enough with the arrows!

467
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:06,280
Oh, foot!

468
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:11,400
You can fly?

469
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:13,040
Apparently, yes!

470
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:41,646
Are you sure it isn't
the sword unfindable?

471
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:47,681
I think I found it!

472
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:53,366
A hand here. Anyone?

473
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:55,605
Anyone else?

474
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:00,966
Kubo!

475
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:16,881
- Kubo!
- Monkey!

476
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:19,361
Whoa!

477
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:20,606
- No!
- Kubo!

478
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:25,206
Huh.

479
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:37,841
Yes!

480
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,365
Thank goodness that's over.

481
00:47:57,720 --> 00:48:01,160
Everything turning black.

482
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:03,083
Then open your eyes.

483
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:05,481
Oh.

484
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:07,120
I can't feel my wings.

485
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:09,600
You didn't even know
you had them five minutes ago.

486
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:10,840
Stop wriggling.

487
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:11,921
Here.

488
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:13,087
Is that feeling better?

489
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:14,645
Oh, yeah. A little to the left.

490
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:17,200
Down, just a bit.

491
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:20,280
Right there. That's good.

492
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:22,360
Wait, you're being nice to me.

493
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:24,040
Shh. Don't tell anyone.

494
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:25,246
We did it, Beetle.

495
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:26,766
We got the sword.

496
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:33,928
Whoa. Put that down, it's sharp!

497
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:43,240
Ooh. Mmm.

498
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:47,245
Okay, we're done here. Get up.

499
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:48,720
We have a lot of walking to do.

500
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:49,961
You can't be serious.

501
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:52,084
I'm always serious.

502
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:54,920
Are you two going to fight, again?

503
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,480
Of course not.
We're having a grown-up conversation.

504
00:48:57,560 --> 00:48:58,680
You're going to fight again.

505
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:01,040
Kubo, just go over there
and play with something.

506
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:02,720
Not that!

507
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:06,160
Monkey, this is the Long Lake.

508
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:08,400
We can't walk around it.

509
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:09,686
We need to swim across.

510
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:11,880
I can carry Kubo.

511
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:14,480
"Carry Kubo." That's your better idea?

512
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:16,960
Look, I appreciate your help. I really do.

513
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:18,640
But when it comes to the boy,

514
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:20,040
- I know what's best.
- Oh, is that right?

515
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:23,960
And what's best is not to be
fielding ideas from a talking cockroach.

516
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:25,720
This coming from a talking monkey.

517
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:27,480
I can still hear you, you know.

518
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:29,244
Then play louder.

519
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:31,960
This conversation is over.
Monkeys don't swim.

520
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:34,800
Not to worry. Monkey see, monkey do.

521
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:36,520
How long have you been
waiting to say that?

522
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:38,125
Ever since I met you.

523
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:40,408
Hey, what were we grown-up
conversation-ing about?

524
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:43,520
You're ridiculous.
You're just absolutely ridiculous.

525
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:44,600
Ridiculous!

526
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:47,880
Crossing the lake is a ridiculous idea.

527
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:51,200
It's not your fault.
There's no sense left in your head.

528
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:52,360
I think I resent that.

529
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:54,520
I may not know everything...

530
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:56,040
- Anything.
- Anything.

531
00:49:56,120 --> 00:49:59,200
But I do know Kubo is more
capable than you think he is.

532
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:02,320
You're being a tiny
bit overprotective here.

533
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,160
I'm being a lot overprotective here.

534
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:07,880
It's my job to make sure Kubo
is safe, and that is not safe.

535
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:10,040
You... You are not safe.

536
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:11,840
Kubo is just a child.

537
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:14,760
And an incredibly gifted one.
He just saved our lives.

538
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:20,200
Yes, he's very powerful,
but he still has much to learn!

539
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:21,691
What?

540
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:27,610
Well, fast learner.

541
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:34,120
Did you know you could do that?

542
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:44,440
Show off.

543
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:08,164
Okay, now take a deep breath.

544
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:12,080
Clear your mind.

545
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:14,240
Guess I got that part covered.

546
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:18,200
Now, draw back slowly. That's it.

547
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:21,807
Close one eye.
Guess you got that part covered.

548
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:25,640
Concentrate on what is directly
in front of you.

549
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:28,200
Let everything else fall away.

550
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:31,329
And release!

551
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:33,720
Yeah!

552
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:36,201
Perfect shot!

553
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:37,560
Not bad.

554
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:39,840
And what's your plan for getting
the fish into the boat,

555
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:41,365
so we can actually eat it?

556
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:50,040
Well, I said I was teaching him
how to shoot, not fish.

557
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:52,521
Fishing is tomorrow's lesson.

558
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:54,291
- Give me that.
- Whoa.

559
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:55,886
Grabby monkey.

560
00:51:58,160 --> 00:51:59,286
Now try it.

561
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:04,201
Pull back and...

562
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:08,041
Whoo-hoo!

563
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:10,320
A rope.

564
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:11,640
It's a pretty good idea.

565
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:13,927
Hmm. And you're not an awful shot.

566
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:19,481
Okay, now you two are being weird.

567
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:22,600
Um...

568
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:25,160
We're going to need
something to cut this with.

569
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:36,404
Sword unbreakable.

570
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:57,448
Must you play with your food?

571
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:01,280
Yes.

572
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:06,806
What's the matter, Kubo?

573
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:09,400
You act like you've never had a meal

574
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:11,687
sitting between a monkey
and a beetle before.

575
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:16,000
I've never had a meal sitting
between anyone before.

576
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:18,480
Come on, eat. You need energy.

577
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:20,600
And this is much better than whale soup.

578
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:23,126
Kubo, question.

579
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:27,764
Before you started on your heroic
quest, what were you like?

580
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:32,240
Well, I looked after my mother mostly.

581
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:36,760
And I told stories about mighty
warriors seeking revenge

582
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:40,208
with battles, and monsters, and magic.

583
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:42,163
I was pretty good at telling them.

584
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:44,645
Not so good at ending them.

585
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:49,400
Sometimes I would tell my mother
stories about little things.

586
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:52,240
Like skimming rocks across the river

587
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:55,560
or catching fireflies
in the mulberry fields.

588
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:59,766
And when I told those stories,
I could see her eyes were mostly clear.

589
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:02,049
I could tell she saw me.

590
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:04,289
Really saw me.

591
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:06,880
I could see her, too.

592
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:08,360
Her real self.

593
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:12,240
Her spirit trying to fight its way out.

594
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:15,091
It was beautiful.

595
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:21,171
You know something, Kubo?

596
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:26,241
Back when you just told stories,
before you went on this great adventure,

597
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:28,847
you were still very much a hero.

598
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:50,680
We're gonna have to head for shore.

599
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:52,808
Find a hiding place and...

600
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:02,720
The second piece of armor.

601
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:04,040
The breastplate.

602
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:06,168
It's down there?

603
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:07,520
Okay, I got it.

604
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:09,600
- Beetle, wait!
- No, don't worry.

605
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:13,320
Beetles can hold their breath
under water for a very long time.

606
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:14,480
What? Since when?

607
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:16,160
It's a well-known fact, Monkey.

608
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:18,800
So, you don't remember anything
at all, but beetles swimming?

609
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:20,320
That's what sticks in there?

610
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:21,360
No, Beetle.

611
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:24,320
My mother told me
a story about the Long Lake.

612
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:26,160
There's something under the water.

613
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:27,241
Oh, yeah?

614
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:28,845
Um...

615
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:31,000
What kind of something?

616
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:33,160
She said there was a garden of eyes,

617
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:36,680
eyes that stare into you, into your soul.

618
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:40,924
They show you secrets, things
to keep you down there with them.

619
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:42,647
Forever.

620
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:44,885
Okay.

621
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:48,240
Well, I won't look
directly into anyone's eyes,

622
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:50,607
even if I'm being incredibly sincere.

623
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:53,520
You're gonna miss me, Monkey.

624
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:04,481
Be careful.

625
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:35,840
He's searching for the armor
just like his insolent father.

626
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:37,640
Yes, sister.

627
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:42,169
Then we must ensure he
does not find what remains.

628
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:55,802
Monkey, I think he's in trouble!

629
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:57,680
We should help him.

630
00:56:57,760 --> 00:57:00,760
Kubo, your aunts are still out there.
I'm sorry.

631
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:03,002
But we have to head for shore.

632
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:05,121
Kubo!

633
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:12,520
Kubo.

634
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:16,285
Look at this.

635
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:21,282
I come fishing and all I reel in
is a stinking ape.

636
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:25,080
How pathetic that this filthy creature

637
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:27,481
is all that's left of my sister's magic.

638
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:31,162
This filthy creature will tear you apart!

639
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:08,050
Kubo.

640
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:25,081
Kubo?

641
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:31,729
I have crushed creatures who could
fit this world on their fingernail.

642
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:34,402
This victory brings me no honor.

643
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:41,210
Imagine how you're going
to feel when you lose.

644
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:46,402
I felt loss only once.

645
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:49,965
Eleven years ago, I lost my sister.

646
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:55,926
She fell in love with a fool
and betrayed our father!

647
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:00,802
She was an ungrateful coward!

648
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:13,928
Who's the coward now?

649
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:28,448
I got it! I got it!

650
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:34,082
Beetle, what happened? Where's Kubo?

651
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:35,890
Um...

652
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:44,166
Uh-oh.

653
00:59:54,040 --> 00:59:56,646
Get back down there! He's in trouble!

654
00:59:57,160 --> 00:59:58,969
I got it.

655
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:13,330
Mother. Mother.

656
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,280
Mother. Mother.

657
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:18,250
Mother.

658
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:50,000
It never fails to amaze me

659
01:00:50,080 --> 01:00:54,720
how the creatures down here fight
so hard just to die another day.

660
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:57,724
Down here, there are
days worth fighting for.

661
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:01,249
There is nothing down here worth anything!

662
01:01:08,680 --> 01:01:11,240
It's pathetic what happened to my sister.

663
01:01:11,320 --> 01:01:14,244
I looked up to her. She was so strong.

664
01:01:15,080 --> 01:01:17,640
And love made her weak.

665
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:18,720
No!

666
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:21,611
It made me stronger.

667
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:39,881
Over here.

668
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:42,965
The eyes...

669
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:44,966
It was the eyes.

670
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:47,285
They had him in a trance.

671
01:01:47,720 --> 01:01:49,040
Oh, no.

672
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:50,560
No.

673
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:53,160
Come on. Come on, Kubo.

674
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:56,403
Wake up. Please wake up!

675
01:01:58,680 --> 01:02:01,604
Please, please wake up.

676
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:04,130
It's gonna be all right.

677
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:06,604
It's gonna be all right.

678
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:08,281
I'm here.

679
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:10,845
I'm right here.

680
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:35,321
I saw...

681
01:02:35,840 --> 01:02:37,444
What? What did you see?

682
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:39,001
I saw...

683
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:42,487
Mother.

684
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:44,726
My son.

685
01:02:58,600 --> 01:03:01,444
So, you must look
more like your dad, then?

686
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:06,771
You're staring.

687
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,480
Let me guess. You have questions.

688
01:03:11,360 --> 01:03:12,960
- Why...
- I'll start.

689
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:16,680
First question.
If I'm Beetle and you're Monkey,

690
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:18,364
why isn't he called "Boy"?

691
01:03:20,560 --> 01:03:21,721
Oh, boy.

692
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:24,929
Questions can wait.

693
01:03:25,480 --> 01:03:26,640
We need sleep.

694
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:29,724
Tell us your story, then we can sleep.

695
01:03:30,560 --> 01:03:31,641
Please?

696
01:03:33,040 --> 01:03:34,087
Okay.

697
01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:36,250
Perhaps you can help me.

698
01:03:44,280 --> 01:03:46,601
The night I met your father...

699
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:51,966
Mother.

700
01:03:55,760 --> 01:04:01,005
My sisters and I went to the Temple
of Bones to kill Hanzo.

701
01:04:06,440 --> 01:04:07,566
Oh, right.

702
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:17,240
At the bidding of the Moon King,

703
01:04:17,320 --> 01:04:20,120
my sisters and I had
come down from the night sky

704
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:22,407
and killed many noble warriors.

705
01:04:23,040 --> 01:04:25,360
Your grandfather told us

706
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:28,125
that any man who found the magical armor

707
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:31,883
would grow too powerful
and be a threat to the heavens.

708
01:04:32,440 --> 01:04:36,206
That night, I arrived
at the temple before my sisters.

709
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:41,481
And there he was, the mighty Hanzo.

710
01:04:44,680 --> 01:04:47,331
"You have offended my father," I told him.

711
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:49,480
"Now you must die."

712
01:04:49,560 --> 01:04:51,960
Yeah, that's so you.

713
01:04:52,040 --> 01:04:53,883
Beetle. Shh!

714
01:04:54,760 --> 01:04:56,125
We fought.

715
01:05:01,360 --> 01:05:02,805
Hanzo was strong.

716
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:05,331
But then he stopped.

717
01:05:06,120 --> 01:05:09,442
He looked into my eyes
and uttered four simple words.

718
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:12,768
These words changed everything.

719
01:05:13,720 --> 01:05:17,281
"I love you,

720
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:19,405
"Monkey"?

721
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:23,880
"You are my quest,"

722
01:05:23,960 --> 01:05:25,200
he whispered.

723
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:28,080
I had seen the wonders of the universe,

724
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:32,006
but the warmth of his gaze
as I looked into his eyes...

725
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:36,686
That... That I had never known.

726
01:05:36,920 --> 01:05:39,280
It was his humanity I saw.

727
01:05:39,360 --> 01:05:43,203
And it was more powerful
than anything in my cold realm.

728
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:48,530
In recognizing his compassion,
I recognized my own.

729
01:05:49,320 --> 01:05:50,890
I spared his life.

730
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:53,050
He gave me mine.

731
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:56,925
And... And then he gave me you.

732
01:05:58,200 --> 01:06:00,123
But your grandfather found us.

733
01:06:01,080 --> 01:06:04,641
His rage at my betrayal shook the heavens.

734
01:06:10,080 --> 01:06:13,560
Your father and his army gave their lives,

735
01:06:13,640 --> 01:06:16,405
allowing me to escape with you in my arms.

736
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:22,605
Why does Grandfather hate me?

737
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:24,686
Oh, Kubo...

738
01:06:26,040 --> 01:06:27,530
He doesn't hate you.

739
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:31,240
He wants to make you just like him.

740
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:33,004
Blind to humanity,

741
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:36,004
as I once was.

742
01:06:36,560 --> 01:06:40,484
Only then can you take your place
beside him as part of his family.

743
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:43,128
Cold and hard.

744
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:46,051
And perfect.

745
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:49,966
I'll never be like him, never.

746
01:06:52,920 --> 01:06:54,160
I know.

747
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:06,560
He's exhausted.

748
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:07,641
Mmm.

749
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:09,640
Me, too.

750
01:07:09,720 --> 01:07:11,449
I'm not tucking you in.

751
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:17,041
You're hurt.

752
01:07:18,680 --> 01:07:20,125
It's just a scratch.

753
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:27,924
Monkey, why didn't you tell him
sooner who you really are?

754
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:34,129
The magic that keeps me here, it's fading.

755
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:36,970
Soon I'll be gone.

756
01:07:37,840 --> 01:07:40,240
And then Kubo will be alone again.

757
01:07:40,320 --> 01:07:41,481
Not alone.

758
01:07:41,880 --> 01:07:44,280
He is the son of Hanzo.

759
01:07:44,360 --> 01:07:47,807
I will do everything I can
to keep him from harm.

760
01:07:48,680 --> 01:07:50,284
Thank you, Beetle.

761
01:07:50,840 --> 01:07:55,482
To know Kubo has someone
to watch over him when I'm gone.

762
01:07:57,160 --> 01:07:59,845
That would be a fine way to end my story.

763
01:08:00,920 --> 01:08:04,322
Your story will never end.

764
01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:09,160
It will be told by him
and by the people he shares it with.

765
01:08:09,240 --> 01:08:11,368
And by the people they share it with.

766
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:16,320
And by the people they share it with,
and by the people they share it with.

767
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:18,050
- And by the people...
- Beetle.

768
01:08:18,480 --> 01:08:23,008
The point is your story will live on

769
01:08:23,840 --> 01:08:25,001
in him.

770
01:08:55,160 --> 01:08:56,924
Hello, my young friend.

771
01:08:57,600 --> 01:08:59,682
Why don't you join in my song?

772
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:01,926
But how did you...

773
01:09:02,120 --> 01:09:04,600
- You're...
- Even blinder than you?

774
01:09:05,400 --> 01:09:07,120
Twice as much, to be precise.

775
01:09:08,760 --> 01:09:11,730
Which means I see double the truth.

776
01:09:12,760 --> 01:09:14,285
This is all a dream.

777
01:09:15,280 --> 01:09:17,203
Is this a good dream or a bad one?

778
01:09:17,440 --> 01:09:19,204
See for yourself.

779
01:09:36,920 --> 01:09:38,840
My father's fortress.

780
01:09:38,920 --> 01:09:39,921
Yes.

781
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:48,770
The last piece of the armor.

782
01:09:49,160 --> 01:09:50,286
It's here?

783
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:54,129
Follow the setting sun and you'll find it,

784
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:57,603
in the place that
might have been your home.

785
01:09:58,440 --> 01:10:01,205
Claim your birthright, Kubo.

786
01:10:02,280 --> 01:10:05,409
Give this story a happy ending.

787
01:10:10,720 --> 01:10:12,720
Mother! Beetle! Wake up!

788
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:14,520
I'm up. I'm up.

789
01:10:14,600 --> 01:10:16,648
Well, I'm down.

790
01:10:17,040 --> 01:10:18,087
Off.

791
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:20,209
I think I slept on something.

792
01:10:21,880 --> 01:10:23,484
Sword uncomfortable.

793
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:25,880
The helmet, I know where it is.

794
01:10:25,960 --> 01:10:27,644
I saw it in a dream, Beetle.

795
01:10:28,160 --> 01:10:29,491
A dream?

796
01:10:30,120 --> 01:10:32,720
Well, it doesn't mean
anything in particular.

797
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:36,805
I mean, I dreamed I fought a giant
skeleton with swords in its head.

798
01:10:37,160 --> 01:10:39,240
That really happened.

799
01:10:39,320 --> 01:10:40,560
Oh, yeah.

800
01:10:40,720 --> 01:10:42,240
Beetle.

801
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:44,243
Come on, this way.

802
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:26,365
I spy with my one eye
something beginning with "S."

803
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:30,371
- Snow?
- No.

804
01:11:32,280 --> 01:11:33,361
Snowflake?

805
01:11:33,720 --> 01:11:35,290
- No.
- Okay.

806
01:11:36,080 --> 01:11:37,120
Oh. Pfft.

807
01:11:37,200 --> 01:11:38,320
Snow covered trees.

808
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:40,289
Nothing to do with snow.

809
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:42,963
How about "serious"?

810
01:11:43,960 --> 01:11:45,166
Stupid.

811
01:11:46,200 --> 01:11:47,520
Okay, I got it.

812
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:48,800
Snow.

813
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:51,565
He said it wasn't "snow."

814
01:11:51,880 --> 01:11:53,320
It's a song.

815
01:11:53,400 --> 01:11:54,840
Well, that's not fair.

816
01:11:54,920 --> 01:11:56,280
How do you see a song?

817
01:11:56,360 --> 01:11:57,361
You look.

818
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:01,405
Golden heron.

819
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:05,080
It's believed they hold
the souls of the departed,

820
01:12:05,160 --> 01:12:07,561
carrying them over
to wherever they need to go.

821
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:09,401
Hmm.

822
01:12:10,160 --> 01:12:11,730
What are they singing?

823
01:12:12,920 --> 01:12:14,331
It's beautiful.

824
01:12:14,480 --> 01:12:17,927
Many say the song's about
what happens when we die.

825
01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:22,123
How we don't just disappear.

826
01:12:22,600 --> 01:12:23,680
We don't?

827
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:26,206
Uh, so, what happens to us?

828
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:28,680
Well, like Kubo's paper, we shift.

829
01:12:28,760 --> 01:12:32,566
We transform so we can continue
our story to another place.

830
01:12:33,160 --> 01:12:37,085
The end of one story is merely
the beginning of another.

831
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:01,969
I remember this place.

832
01:13:42,520 --> 01:13:45,330
This was where my father
prepared for his quest.

833
01:14:10,520 --> 01:14:12,960
There's something I don't understand.

834
01:14:13,040 --> 01:14:14,849
Why would the helmet be here?

835
01:14:19,680 --> 01:14:20,886
Kubo!

836
01:14:52,920 --> 01:14:54,160
Release us!

837
01:14:54,920 --> 01:14:56,570
Oh, sister.

838
01:14:58,240 --> 01:15:00,402
I remember how we looked up to you.

839
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:04,206
Of all of us, you shone the brightest.

840
01:15:05,040 --> 01:15:06,485
Such a waste.

841
01:15:07,200 --> 01:15:11,489
All we ever wished was to be
a family in our home among the stars.

842
01:15:11,800 --> 01:15:15,080
I think we have very different
definitions of family.

843
01:15:15,160 --> 01:15:17,200
Don't you touch him, you witch!

844
01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:18,680
And then there's you,

845
01:15:18,760 --> 01:15:22,200
the thieving insect
who stole my sister's soul.

846
01:15:22,280 --> 01:15:23,281
What?

847
01:15:25,200 --> 01:15:27,123
Oh, this is precious.

848
01:15:27,320 --> 01:15:31,527
You've been together all this time
and you haven't even realized?

849
01:15:36,120 --> 01:15:38,120
You took her from us.

850
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:40,965
It was only fitting
we took something from you.

851
01:15:41,400 --> 01:15:44,320
How swiftly those memories
spilled from your head,

852
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:48,720
wiping out all recollection
of your obscene union.

853
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:50,040
Hanzo.

854
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:51,721
What?

855
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:53,801
Hanzo?

856
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:57,489
I... I didn't know.

857
01:16:00,680 --> 01:16:02,170
No!

858
01:16:07,480 --> 01:16:10,643
I'm forgetting what I came here for.

859
01:16:59,320 --> 01:17:00,446
Mother!

860
01:17:17,720 --> 01:17:19,768
Shh. It's okay. I'm here.

861
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:21,766
Father?

862
01:17:22,720 --> 01:17:23,801
My son.

863
01:17:30,120 --> 01:17:32,248
Seems I'm married to a bug.

864
01:17:33,200 --> 01:17:34,326
Yeah.

865
01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:36,885
But a samurai bug.

866
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:42,642
You are my quest.

867
01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:45,410
You always have been.

868
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:51,889
Hanzo, keep him safe, no matter what.

869
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:56,210
I promise I will.

870
01:18:05,760 --> 01:18:06,807
No!

871
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:11,522
Fly home, Kubo.

872
01:21:07,120 --> 01:21:09,202
Kubo? Is that you?

873
01:21:12,240 --> 01:21:13,960
You have to leave this place.

874
01:21:14,040 --> 01:21:16,486
The Moon King, he's coming.

875
01:21:30,480 --> 01:21:31,720
Grandfather!

876
01:21:32,480 --> 01:21:34,050
It's me, Kubo!

877
01:21:34,920 --> 01:21:36,809
I know you can see me!

878
01:21:39,480 --> 01:21:41,482
Hello, grandson.

879
01:21:42,200 --> 01:21:44,567
It's so good to see you at last.

880
01:21:45,160 --> 01:21:46,650
So to speak.

881
01:21:49,120 --> 01:21:52,363
And I see you found the armor.

882
01:21:53,640 --> 01:21:55,440
Seems your mother had a reason

883
01:21:55,520 --> 01:21:58,205
to bring you to this
dreadful place after all.

884
01:22:03,040 --> 01:22:04,326
I see.

885
01:22:06,320 --> 01:22:07,526
I know you do.

886
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:11,288
That's how this all began.
You finally saw me.

887
01:22:12,080 --> 01:22:15,482
It was my fault.
I should've listened to my parents.

888
01:22:17,040 --> 01:22:21,680
Kubo, we both want the exact same thing.

889
01:22:21,760 --> 01:22:24,843
You want to take my other eye.
That's what you want!

890
01:22:25,720 --> 01:22:30,408
Well, yes. But do you know why I want it?

891
01:22:31,240 --> 01:22:35,080
Because you're old, and mean, and cruel.

892
01:22:35,160 --> 01:22:37,800
Oh, now, that's a little harsh.

893
01:22:37,880 --> 01:22:42,040
As long as you cling
to that silly, useless eye,

894
01:22:42,120 --> 01:22:45,044
you can't come up to live with me.

895
01:22:45,720 --> 01:22:47,324
In the heavens.

896
01:22:47,840 --> 01:22:52,640
You'll be stuck down here in this hell,

897
01:22:52,720 --> 01:22:58,320
staring with that lonely eye
at hate and heartache

898
01:22:58,400 --> 01:23:02,485
and suffering and death.

899
01:23:05,760 --> 01:23:07,091
Where I want to take you,

900
01:23:07,240 --> 01:23:10,480
we have none of those things.

901
01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:13,848
It'll just be you with your family.

902
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:15,760
Where you belong.

903
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:18,000
My family is gone.

904
01:23:18,080 --> 01:23:20,680
- You killed them.
- No...

905
01:23:20,760 --> 01:23:24,360
They brought their fates upon themselves!

906
01:23:24,440 --> 01:23:29,600
They disgraced me and upset
the order of everything!

907
01:23:29,680 --> 01:23:31,762
That's how your story goes.

908
01:23:33,640 --> 01:23:35,085
Oh, Kubo...

909
01:23:35,600 --> 01:23:40,240
When you're up there with me,
you will be beyond stories.

910
01:23:40,320 --> 01:23:44,769
You will be immortal.

911
01:23:45,200 --> 01:23:46,929
You will be

912
01:23:49,200 --> 01:23:50,929
infinite.

913
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:55,280
No. You're wrong, not infinite.

914
01:23:55,360 --> 01:23:57,601
All stories have an end.

915
01:23:58,160 --> 01:24:00,128
Is that right?

916
01:24:00,880 --> 01:24:04,123
And how does this story end?

917
01:24:07,080 --> 01:24:08,680
I kill you.

918
01:24:08,760 --> 01:24:09,761
Oh.

919
01:24:10,040 --> 01:24:12,880
Very well. Is this your wish,

920
01:24:12,960 --> 01:24:17,360
to do battle with a hideous monster
who ruined your life,

921
01:24:17,440 --> 01:24:22,162
to prove your worth
like your doomed father?

922
01:24:22,680 --> 01:24:24,489
How mortal.

923
01:25:44,560 --> 01:25:47,211
You want to be human?

924
01:25:47,480 --> 01:25:51,280
Then share their weakness!

925
01:25:52,400 --> 01:25:55,722
Suffer their humiliation!

926
01:25:57,400 --> 01:25:59,562
Feel their pain!

927
01:26:43,280 --> 01:26:47,205
This is the end of your story.

928
01:26:47,440 --> 01:26:51,960
Now, take one last
look with that lonely eye,

929
01:26:52,040 --> 01:26:58,571
one last look at this wretched
place you call home.

930
01:26:59,960 --> 01:27:01,849
I'm not leaving.

931
01:27:02,600 --> 01:27:07,402
For every horrible thing down here,
there's something far more beautiful.

932
01:27:07,880 --> 01:27:09,680
My mother saw it.

933
01:27:09,760 --> 01:27:12,161
So did my father. I see it.

934
01:27:12,440 --> 01:27:14,249
Even with just one eye.

935
01:27:14,400 --> 01:27:18,644
Then I'll just have to
rip it out of your head again,

936
01:27:18,920 --> 01:27:20,160
won't I?

937
01:27:23,120 --> 01:27:25,691
If you must blink, do it now.

938
01:27:29,840 --> 01:27:31,968
I know why you want my eye.

939
01:27:32,680 --> 01:27:37,328
Because without it, I can't look into
the eyes of another and see their soul.

940
01:27:37,640 --> 01:27:41,247
- Their love...
- Everything you loved is gone!

941
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:45,480
Everything you knew
has been taken from you!

942
01:27:45,560 --> 01:27:46,760
No.

943
01:27:46,840 --> 01:27:48,280
It's in my memories.

944
01:27:48,360 --> 01:27:50,761
The most powerful kind of magic there is.

945
01:28:03,880 --> 01:28:06,565
It makes us stronger than you'll ever be.

946
01:28:09,520 --> 01:28:13,491
These are the memories
of those we have loved and lost.

947
01:28:14,040 --> 01:28:17,203
And if we hold their stories
deep in our hearts,

948
01:28:17,720 --> 01:28:20,644
then you will never
take them away from us.

949
01:28:33,360 --> 01:28:35,362
And that really is the least of it.

950
01:28:55,320 --> 01:28:56,960
Where am I?

951
01:28:57,040 --> 01:28:59,202
Hello, Grandfather.

952
01:28:59,760 --> 01:29:00,966
Oh, hello.

953
01:29:03,080 --> 01:29:05,128
What happened to your eye?

954
01:29:05,600 --> 01:29:06,931
Don't you remember?

955
01:29:07,720 --> 01:29:11,167
No, I... I'm sorry, young man.

956
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,446
But I seem to have forgotten my story.

957
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:17,604
Can you help me?

958
01:29:19,560 --> 01:29:21,000
I'll tell him.

959
01:29:21,080 --> 01:29:22,720
No, we'll all tell him.

960
01:29:22,800 --> 01:29:25,565
We'll tell him everything
he needs to know.

961
01:29:26,440 --> 01:29:30,600
You are the kindest, sweetest man

962
01:29:30,680 --> 01:29:32,480
to ever live in this village.

963
01:29:32,560 --> 01:29:34,440
- Oh. Oh, really?
- Yes.

964
01:29:34,520 --> 01:29:35,720
Uh... Uh...

965
01:29:35,800 --> 01:29:39,880
Every day, you walk around smiling
and handing out coins to children.

966
01:29:39,960 --> 01:29:41,040
Like me!

967
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:42,840
And old women.

968
01:29:42,920 --> 01:29:43,920
Oh.

969
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,560
You... You taught my kids to swim.

970
01:29:46,640 --> 01:29:47,680
What?

971
01:29:47,760 --> 01:29:49,960
And you give blankets to the poor.

972
01:29:50,040 --> 01:29:51,007
You're a good man.

973
01:29:51,120 --> 01:29:53,640
- You fed the hungry.
- You always lend a helping hand.

974
01:29:53,720 --> 01:29:55,920
You're a great example.

975
01:29:57,800 --> 01:29:59,440
It turns out I'm pretty selfless.

976
01:29:59,520 --> 01:30:01,160
That's why we love you.

977
01:30:01,240 --> 01:30:05,240
You know, we have something in common.

978
01:30:05,320 --> 01:30:07,527
We both adore your grandson.

979
01:30:08,840 --> 01:30:11,207
His name is Kubo.

980
01:30:13,440 --> 01:30:14,930
Kubo?

981
01:30:16,440 --> 01:30:18,010
I'm sorry.

982
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:21,890
But I... But I don't remember.

983
01:30:22,680 --> 01:30:23,761
Well...

984
01:30:24,360 --> 01:30:26,840
Your grandson's a storyteller.

985
01:30:27,840 --> 01:30:30,684
He'll tell you all the stories
you've forgotten.

986
01:30:32,040 --> 01:30:33,326
Really?

987
01:30:36,760 --> 01:30:38,125
Of course.

988
01:31:05,800 --> 01:31:06,881
Hello, Mother.

989
01:31:07,880 --> 01:31:08,881
Father.

990
01:31:10,120 --> 01:31:15,280
I know my stories can tend
to get a little, um, long,

991
01:31:15,360 --> 01:31:17,886
so I'll keep this brief.

992
01:31:19,040 --> 01:31:22,203
I'm very grateful I've had
the chance to meet you both,

993
01:31:22,840 --> 01:31:26,208
hear your wisdom, feel your kindness,

994
01:31:27,120 --> 01:31:29,487
even eat a meal sitting between you.

995
01:31:30,680 --> 01:31:32,569
This was a happy story.

996
01:31:33,440 --> 01:31:37,240
But it could still be a whole lot happier.

997
01:31:39,200 --> 01:31:42,840
I don't know exactly what the rules are

998
01:31:42,920 --> 01:31:47,528
or how this works,
but if there were any way to...

999
01:31:48,360 --> 01:31:51,842
You know, I still need you.

1000
01:31:52,920 --> 01:31:57,725
So I can say this has been
a happy story, or I could feel it.

1001
01:31:58,080 --> 01:31:59,923
We could all feel it.

1002
01:32:00,880 --> 01:32:02,723
Then we could end this story.

1003
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:05,240
Together.

1004
01:32:48,320 --> 01:32:49,401
The end.
