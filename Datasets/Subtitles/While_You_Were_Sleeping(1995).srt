00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,960
<i>First, I remember being with my dad.</i>

4
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,200
<i>He would get these far-off looks</i>
<i>in his eye,</i>

5
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,680
<i>and he would say,</i>

6
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,040
<i>"Life doesn't always turn out</i>
<i>the way you plan."</i>

7
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:44,040
<i>I just wish I'd realized at the time</i>
<i>he was talking about my life.</i>

8
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:49,160
<i>But that never stopped us</i>
<i>from taking our adventures together.</i>

9
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,800
<i>He would pack up</i>
<i>our sometimes-working car,</i>

10
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:56,320
<i>and he would tell me amazing stories</i>
<i>about strange and exotic lands</i>

11
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:01,680
<i>as we headed off to</i>
<i>exciting destinations like Milwaukee.</i>

12

<i>It's amazing</i>
<i>how exotic Wisconsin isn't.</i>

13
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,680
<i>But my favorite memories</i>
<i>were the stories</i>

14
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,040
<i>that he would tell me about my mom.</i>

15
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,160
<i>He would take me to the church</i>
<i>where they got married,</i>

16
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:16,520
<i>and I'd beg him to tell me more</i>
<i>about the ceremony</i>

17
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,960
<i>and about my crazy Uncle Irwin,</i>

18

<i>who fell asleep</i>
<i>in the macaroni and cheese.</i>

19
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:27,440
<i>And I asked my dad when he</i>
<i>knew that he truly loved my mom.</i>

20
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,880
<i>And he said to me, "Lucy,</i>
<i>your mother gave me a special gift.</i>

21

<i>"She gave me the world."</i>

<i>Well, the first time I saw him,</i>

25
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:51,080

<i>It was a dollar-fifty train token.</i>

00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,160
Maybe he was busy.

169
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,240
Too busy to tell his own mother
he's getting married?

170
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,440
MIDGE: Don't yell at him.
OX: I'm not yelling at him.

171
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,200
-If only Jack were here.
-Grandma?

172
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:37,240
-Is she okay?
-She's got a little heart problem.

173
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,000
She's had three attacks already.

174
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,560
They weren't attacks.
They were episodes.

175
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:42,960
OX: Oh, jeez.

176
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,880
-Nothing wrong with her hearing.
-Excuse me, Doctor.

177
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,560
What is she doing in here?

178
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,960
Hey, buddy, she saved his life.

179
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,120
You saved his life?

180
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,720
Yeah, yeah, but...

181
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:56,080
I thought he was pushed
off a train platform.

182
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,960
She jumped on the tracks.

183
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:00,080
You jumped on the tracks?

184
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:03,400
Doctor, it's supposed to be family only.

185
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:07,280
-She is family.
-She's the fiancée, you idiot.

186
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,960
-Look, I'm sorry, you don't understand.
-MIDGE: I'm awfully sorry.

187
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:13,320
We haven't seen him for a long time,
so we didn't know.

188
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:16,600
I always wanted him to find a nice girl.

189
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,960
I'm so glad he found you.

190
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,480
(CRYING)

191
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,440
Oh, Peter.

192
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,640
-Why did you say that?
-Say what?

193
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,320
-I'm not his fiancée.
-Why did you tell me that you were?

194
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,480
I'm not engaged.
I've never even spoken to the guy.

195
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:43,160
What? But downstairs you said...
You said you were gonna marry him.

196
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,960
Oh, jeez, I was talking to myself.

197
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:48,120
Well, next time you talk to yourself,

198
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,640
tell yourself you're single
and end the conversation.

199
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,920
-What am I gonna do?
-I don't know.

200
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,600
She held me so tight.
You know, I couldn't tell her.

201
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,120
-I know.
-Excuse me, nurse.

202
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,160
-Is there a pharmacy in the hospital?
-What do you need?

203
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,640
Elsie, she wants nitroglycerin.

204
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,320
Oh, for her heart problem?

205
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,600
Problem? (CHUCKLES)

206
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,160
Problems.

207
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:13,240
You know something,
I think you saved her life.

208
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,840
In fact, I think you saved
the whole family.

209
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,080
Bless you.

210
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:21,000
WANDA: Why don't you come with me?
I'll take you down there.

211
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:47,960
So,

212
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,800
tell us how you met Peter.

213
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,800
Ma, she doesn't wanna
talk about that now, okay?

214
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:56,120
ELSIE: Why not?
Could use a nice story.

215
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,200
-How do you know it was nice?
-ELSIE: Of course it was nice.

216
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,600
Why shouldn't it be nice?

217
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,240
What about that other girl?
The one he met in the bar.

218
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,520
What's that got to do
with the price of eggs?

219
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:07,400
-Ashley Bartlett Bacon.
-MIDGE: Ox.

220
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,400
All I know is
she was pretty high and mighty

221
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,800
for someone named
after breakfast meat.

222
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:14,080
Well, he has a nice girl now.

223
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,280
So did you steal him from Ashley?

224
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:20,080
I bet it was love at first sight. Right?

225
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,280
I have a sense about these things.

226
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,880
-Elsie, let her tell it.
-She is telling it.

227
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:28,240
I bet that he picked you up
in that fancy car of his...

228
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:31,200
What was it about him that,
you know, first struck you?

229
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,760
-It was his, uh, smile.
-They're caps.

230
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,520
-Six hundred bucks a tooth.
-Shh!

231
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:43,520
Well, um, we saw each other

232
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:47,360
and, um, he smiled.

233
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,360
And...

234
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:54,440
And I knew that my life
would never be the same.

235
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,720
So...

236
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:05,240
-Tomorrow night, 8:00.
-What?

237
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,720
I got Ice Capades. I know a guy.

238
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,440
LUCY: Hi.

239
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,640
Um...

240
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:41,120
Bet you're wondering what I'm doing
here in the middle of the night, huh?

241
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,360
Well, I thought
I should introduce myself.

242
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,920
My name's Lucy.

243
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,160
Lucy Eleanor Moderatz.

244
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,040
Um...

245
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:55,800
Think you should know
your family thinks we're engaged.

246
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,800
Never been engaged before.
This is all very sudden for me.

247
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:10,920
What I really came here to tell you
was that

248
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,960
I didn't mean for this to happen.

249
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,440
I don't know what to do.

250
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:24,960
I mean, if you were awake,
I wouldn't be in this mess.

251
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,840
Oh, God. Not that I'm blaming you.
Sorry.

252
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:31,000
It's just that, you know,
when I was a kid,

253
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:36,160
I always imagined what I would be like,

254
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:40,720
or where I would be,
or what I would have when I got older.

255
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,320
And, you know, it was the normal stuff.

256
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,600
You know, I'd have a house and family
and things like that.

257
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:48,480
You know, not that I'm complaining
or anything,

258
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,880
because, you know, I have a cat.

259
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,240
I have an apartment. Um...

260
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,880
Sole possession of the remote control.
That's very important.

261
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,840
It's just...

262
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,880
I never met anybody
that I could laugh with, you know?

263
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,000
Do you believe in love at first sight?

264
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,440
No, I bet you don't.
You're probably too sensible for that.

265
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,280
Or have you ever, like, seen somebody,

266
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:28,840
and you knew that if only that person
really knew you, they would...

267
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,840
Well, they would of course dump
the perfect model that they were with

268
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:36,840
and realize that you were the one
that they wanted to just grow old with.

269
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,760
Have you ever fallen in love with
somebody you haven't even talked to?

270
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,880
Have you ever been so alone you spend
the night confusing a man in a coma?

271
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,480
-(PHONE RINGING)
-MAN ON PA: <i>Brian Lynch.</i>

272
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:41,520
<i>Mr. Brian Lynch,</i>
<i>please call Amber Lynch at 2617.</i>

273
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,440
Oh, my God.

274
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,240
Bye.

275
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:59,760
-Lucy. We didn't know you were here.
-Hi.

276
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,200
-LUCY: Hi.
-Hi.

277
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,040
-Were you here all night?
-Yeah.

278
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,600
You're like me.
I could always sleep anywhere.

279
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,520
And believe me, she has.

280
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:12,280
Way to go, Gram.

281
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,080
So how's Peter?

282
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:16,320
LUCY: Well, he's got more color.

283
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,240
He has some color.
Looks like he has some color.

284
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,400
Yeah.

285
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,560
Well, I have to go,
so it was great to see you guys again.

286
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,920
-Why don't you tell her? Go on, tell her.
-Yeah.

287
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,880
We didn't get to celebrate Christmas,

288
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:31,600
so it would be nice if you could join us.

289
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,360
Oh, um...

290
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:36,600
I would love to, but I can't.

291
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:40,440
-Jack's gonna be there.
-That's right. You haven't met Jack yet.

292
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:44,920
-No, not yet.
-He'll be so happy to meet you.

293
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,040
So you'll come tonight?

294
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:48,600
I really shouldn't,
because I have to work. I can't.

295
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:51,720
OX: Look, here. Put your phone number
and address there.

296
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,600
Midge'll call you and talk you into it.

297
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,880
LUCY: Okay.

298
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,000
Here's another card
for when you change your mind.

299
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:59,160
We're in the estate-furniture business.

300
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:01,280
We buy furniture from dead people.

301
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:07,440
Okay. All right, well, I have it, so bye.

302
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,520
-MIDGE: Bye, dear. See you later.
-Bye.

303
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:14,280
-Ma'am? Excuse me, ma'am.
-What? What is this?

304
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:16,480
I'm sorry, Mrs. Callaghan.
These are your husband's things.

305
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:18,000
He's not my husband.

306
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,560
I'm sorry. Your fiancé.

307
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,600
(WHINES)

308
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,600
MAN: You're Peter's fiancée?

309
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,560
-Okay.
-Dalton Clarke.

310
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:34,360
Colleague of Peter's
at Lubel, Parker, Jacobs and Fink.

311
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:37,720
-I have to go now.
-He's a great guy.

312
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,160
He's had a tough year.

313
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:41,120
What with the accident
last month and all.

314
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:46,000
-Accident?
-Well, of course it was an accident.

315
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:49,240
I mean, it wasn't my...
Did he tell you it was my fault?

316
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:53,840
We're playing basketball, all right?
I carry a pencil. I'm a lawyer, I do that.

317
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,680
-LUCY: Okay.
-Jesus, what's he...

318
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,440
It's gonna be okay.

319
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,800
JERRY: So, what's the big deal?

320
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:03,560
LUCY: What's the big deal? Jerry, they
think I'm their future daughter-in-law.

321
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,520
And the grandmother,
she's got this heart thing.

322
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,040
If I tell the truth, she's gonna have
a heart attack and die,

323
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,360
and it's gonna be on my head.

324
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,560
Well, then, go along with it.

325
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,720
And when Peter comes out of the coma,

326
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:17,520
the family will be so happy,
they won't care that you lied to them.

327
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,680
They'll probably even thank you for it.

328
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:21,680
Just mustard.

329
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:25,640
Okay, what if he doesn't
come out of his coma?

330
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,400
Well, then who's to know?

331
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,880
-I don't know.
-Now, look, look. Lucy.

332
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,920
When my mother found out
I was getting married to my wife,

333
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,760
her intestines exploded.

334
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,560
-Oh, my God.
-Now, you tell them now,

335
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,920
you might as well shoot Grandma.

336
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:46,440
Come on, Mel. Mel...
Psst, psst, psst!

337
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,920
What am I doing?

338
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,000
SAUL: Lucy.

339
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,960
-LUCY: Hi, Saul. Hi.
-You made it?

340
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:52,600
-Yeah.
-How do you feel?

341
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,520
Okay. Okay.

342
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,600
Come on, keep me company for a while.
I don't like to smoke in the house.

343
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,840
-Listen, you want one?
-I'm trying to quit.

344
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,880
SAUL: (LAUGHS) That's good.

345
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,800
Here, sit down.

346
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,680
They don't bother you, do they?

347
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,720
No, no, I'm fine.

348
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,760
Did you know
that I was Peter's godfather?

349
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,280
Really? I thought you had to be
Catholic for that.

350
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,360
Ox fudged it over.

351
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:19,440
He donated 50 folding chairs
to Father Shea's bingo night.

352
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,840
You know, being a godfather
is very important to Catholics.

353
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:26,960
It means you're practically
part of the family.

354
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,880
Well, you're lucky.

355
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:32,440
It's really important to have family
around this time of year.

356
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,120
Are you, uh...

357
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,600
I mean, are your parents with you?

358
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:40,200
No, no.
My mom died when I was really young.

359
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:42,840
And a couple years ago,
my dad got sick.

360
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:46,800
And we moved from Indiana to Chicago
so he could go to a research hospital.

361
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,120
Research.

362
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:51,560
A medical term for "very expensive"?

363
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:56,680
Yeah. Yeah, exactly. I had to quit school
and then I started working for the CTA.

364
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,760
And about a year ago,

365
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:01,200
he decided
he had had enough research,

366
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:03,160
and he passed away.

367
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:08,240
My wife of 51 years passed away
two years ago, February the 9th.

368
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,640
I'm sorry.

369
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,240
Yeah, it was a rough time for me.

370
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:14,120
-Yeah.
-But Ox got me through.

371
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,720
-You're good friends?
-The best.

372
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:22,280
Lucy, the Callaghans...

373
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:25,200
Well, they took me in
as part of their family.

374
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,680
I'd never let anyone hurt them.

375
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,320
Neither would I.

376
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,840
I believe you wouldn't.

377
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,840
Lucy? You came?

378
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:42,280
Hi, Saul. Oh, this is great.
Okay, come on in, you two.

379
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:45,720
It's freezing out here.
Elsie made her eggnog.

380
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:48,680
-Word to the wise, drink soda.
-Okay.

381
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,720
MIDGE: Ox, Mom, look who's here.
Lucy came.

382
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:54,000
What a surprise.

383
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:57,800
-LUCY: Hi, Mary.
-Come on in. It's cold out there.

384
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,280
Oh, sweetheart.

385
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,480
ELSIE: We've got
the most wonderful dinner.

386
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,760
LUCY: It smells so good.

387
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:03,880
Hi.

388
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,760
This is so beautiful.

389
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,960
MARY: That's Peter on the right.
LUCY: He's so sweet.

390
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,320
MARY: Oh, yeah, the squirrels.

391
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,040
MIDGE: Eggnog, everyone.

392
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:22,400
Ma, where are you?
I'm serving your eggnog.

393
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,360
ELSIE: I'm getting my camera.

394
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,480
Come on, everybody.
Get close to the tree.

395
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,320
MIDGE: Christmas pictures.

396
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:30,000
-Lucy, come on.
-OX: Come on, Lucy.

397
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,920
-MIDGE: Let's go.
-I...

398
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,920
ELSIE: Watch the birdie.

399
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,000
MIDGE: Oh, Ma, take it again. I blinked.

400
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:41,600
-SAUL: You're lucky. I'm blind.
-(WOMEN LAUGHING)

OX: Oh, yeah, I love it.

402
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:46,320
-Oh, excuse me.
-I don't drink anymore.

403
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,520
Oh.

404
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,720
-I don't drink any less either.
-(SAUL LAUGHS)

405
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:52,600
ELSIE: Perhaps I should.
SAUL: You got me on that one.

406
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,160
OX: Oh, look at this.

407
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,120
MIDGE: More presents.
I'll take these two.

408
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:58,240
MARY: What is this?
OX: Open it.

409
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:01,200
SAUL: What is that?
MIDGE: Turn them over.

410
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:02,920
-Pierced? Really?
-MIDGE: Mmm-hmm.

411
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,640
MARY: Oh, my God, thank you.

412
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,880
-We'll go to Wal-Mart on Monday.
-Thank you.

413
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,720
Don't thank me. If it was up to me,
I would've gotten you a Barbie.

414
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,120
MIDGE: Did you like that?
OX: More presents.

415
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:15,040
-We hit the jackpot.
-MARY: Mom, this is for you.

416
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:18,040
Oh! "To Ox, from Uncle Al."

417
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,480
Who the hell is Uncle Al?

418
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:21,080
Uncle Al.
You know, Uncle Al from Buffalo.

419
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,520
SAUL: You remember Al.
OX: Uncle Al?

420
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,640
To Lucy, from Santa.

421
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,520
MIDGE: You remember Uncle Al.
SAUL: Remember Al? He was here.

422
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,320
OX: Oh, yeah, that Uncle Al.

423
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,880
MIDGE: That was
a real good Christmas.

424
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,760
Seven bow ties, I bet.

Thank you.

430

They're so pretty.

MIDGE: You remember Uncle Al,
don't you?

432
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:05,040
ELSIE: No. Yeah, yeah.
Well, he wasn't really uncle.

433
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,360
OX: I never got him anything.
MIDGE: He had this moustache.

434
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,240
He was Daddy's friend, right?

435
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:11,440

Don't wake Lucy.

Who's Lucy?

451
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,840
Lucy's Peter fiancée.

452
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:21,080
No, that's not Peter's fiancée.

453
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,920

Maybe I'll stay the night.

in the morning.

458

the toy surprise, remember?

Um...

465
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,600
I guess I don't remember meeting you.

466
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,920
Well, it's probably because
we've never met.

467
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,920

She's your brother's fiancée.

486
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:33,960
You'd think
if Peter were getting married,

487
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:36,040
he would have announced it
in the <i>Tribune.</i>

-We read the <i>Sun Times.</i> Amen.

She has a job.

what they're saying.

-Got it.

-Himmelstein's?
-Yeah.

-Himmelstein's took too long.

-Stop swearing.

Look, you're running the business now.

00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:23,480
What's that?

676
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:25,080
Cat.

677
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:27,080
Big cat?

678
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:33,040
I think you should bring it to...
Bring it to Peter's apartment.

679
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:35,200
-You don't know what it is.
-Well, you know,

680
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:37,840
anything would look nicer
in Peter's apartment.

681
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:39,920
You know what? I'll come with you.

682
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,960
-(THUMP)
-(JOE JR. GRUNTS)

683
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:08,760
You know what?
I think you parked too...

684
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:14,320
You know, I think you parked
too close to the other car.

685
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:16,640
I had to. We gotta unload the furniture.

686
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:18,320
Ready for your surprise?

687
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,320
Ta-da!

688
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:26,640
Oh, that is great. That is so great.

689
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:30,360
-You like that?
-Yeah.

690
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:33,360
Too bad. Ox bought you the love seat.

691
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:37,080
-LUCY: Oh, I'm sorry.
-Don't be. I made this.

692
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:41,160
-This? No, you didn't.
-Shocking, isn't it?

693
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:44,440
-Can I sit in it?
-Rock out.

694
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:51,920
My God, this is perfect.

695
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:54,240
You should go into business
or something.

696
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:57,000
Well, that gets tricky.

697
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:00,960
Oh, yeah, working with your dad
and everything, right?

698
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:03,520
The business used to be called
Callaghan and Sons,

699
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:07,440
and when Peter went off to law school,
it became Callaghan and Son.

700
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:11,120
If I were to leave, it'll just be Callaghan.

701
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:19,120
Let's take a second here
and unlock the doors...

702
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:22,480
No, I got it, I got it. See? Here we go.

703
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:28,160
Oh, this technique. It's always very...
A very modern technique.

704
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,200
DOORMAN: Excuse me, sir.
What apartment?

705
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:32,360
57G.

706
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:37,280
Well, sir, I'm sorry, but guests
have to be announced, you know?

707
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:39,360
Well, I'm with her. I'm helping her.

708
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:43,400
-So?
-You don't know her?

709
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:46,320
DOORMAN: No.

710
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,680
But I'm new here.

711
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:54,480
Oh, well, she's Peter Callaghan's
fiancée in 57G.

712
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:56,720
Oh. Oh, yeah.

713
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:01,400
They told me about her, sir.

714
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:03,760
She's scary.

715
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:05,080
Tell me about it.

716
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:09,840
(CREAKING)

717
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:11,240
Be careful.

718
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:14,600
Maybe we should angle it a little bit.

719
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:17,440
I think it's wedged.

720
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:20,720
Why don't you step back for a little bit?
I'm gonna try an old trick.

721
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:23,040
What's the trick?

722
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:24,360
Push it really hard.

723
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:27,280
Okay.

724
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:29,760
Okay, okay, push.

725
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:31,560
JACK: I did.

726
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:36,320
Do you want me to help you now?

727
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:39,080
-All right, a little help would be good.
-Okay.

728
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:44,520
Ready? One, two, three.

729
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:46,040
(GRUNTING)

730
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:51,880
Ooh!

731
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:56,800
I think the sofa should go right there.

732
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:06,640
Oh, no. No, no, no. Look at this.
Idiot has blocked me in.

733
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:10,960
-But I told you not to park that close.
-Aargh.

734
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:13,640
Hey, check the meter, see what time.

735
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:17,440
It's 6:00. They can pretty much stay
here all night if they wanted to.

736
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:20,280
-All night, huh?
-Um...

737
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:22,880
Good night.

738
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:24,800
You're just gonna leave me here
with the truck?

739
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:26,720
Basically, yeah.

740
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:28,880
Well, maybe I ought to walk you back.

741
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:30,440
Well, what for?

742
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:33,600
-For protection.
-Oh, no, I'm fine. I'm okay.

743
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:38,000
For me. I don't wanna be here
by myself. This is Chicago.

744
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:48,920
JACK: You look cold.
LUCY: Hmm?

745
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:52,440
JACK: You look cold.
LUCY: Probably because I am cold.

746
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:54,440
How about you?

747
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:57,240
JACK: This jacket's reversible.
I'm wearing the warm side now.

748
00:48:57,320 --> 00:48:59,440
LUCY: (CHUCKLING) Oh, I see.

749
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:01,240
JACK: You need a better coat.

750
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:06,040
-This is my dad's.
-Then he's probably freezing.

751
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:07,840
He passed away.

752
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:10,880
-Sorry.
-It's not your fault.

753
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:15,920
He passed away last year.
I don't even remember my mom, so...

754
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:18,360
Well, what was he like?

755
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:21,760
He was a lot like me.
Dark hair, flat chest.

756
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:24,960
What do you remember most
about him?

757
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:28,880
Oh, that. Okay. Well...

758
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:32,040
He liked maps.

759
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:35,040
Yeah, I live by maps.
My truck's filled with them.

760
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:39,040
He used to hear of a place on the TV,
we would pull out the atlas,

761
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:43,240
we'd find where it was and we'd route
out this, like, little way to get there.

762
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:45,640
If there was one place
in the world where you'd go...

763
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:47,120
Florence.

764
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:50,480
Italy? I haven't delivered
any furniture to Florence yet,

765
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:52,600
-but I'm told it's nice.
-Yeah.

766
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:54,400
I take it you've never been there.

767
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:58,400
Well, you know, the L doesn't exactly
make it all the way to Florence, so...

768
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:01,840
Oh, but I do have...

769
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:05,760
My passport.

770
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:08,640
-You have your passport? With you?
-Yes, I do.

771
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:11,000
Yes, well, just in case I need to
quickly leave the country.

772
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:13,440
-You need to...
-Yeah, it's perfect. It's great.

773
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:17,880
Oh, you're right.
You're not very photogenic at all.

774
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:20,800
Just joking.

775
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:22,680
There aren't any stamps in that.

776
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:25,280
Yeah, well, I haven't gone anywhere yet.

777
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:27,680
But, you know, I'm planning
the trip to Florence really soon,

778
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:29,600
so, you know, I'll go.

779
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:33,880
That'll make your dad very proud.

780
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:35,280
Yeah.

781
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:41,960
You know, in a very small way,
you kind of remind me of him a little bit.

782
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:44,640
I see.

783
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:47,840
So he was a classy guy,
always a gentleman.

784
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:48,880
A working man, who...

785
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:50,880
Who just stepped in doggy poopy.

786
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:52,680
Oh! (LAUGHING)

787
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:56,640
Now, that's classy. That's classy.

788
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:01,280
JACK: All right, tell me more.
Where did you grow up?

789
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:03,880
LUCY: God, you've just become
Mr. Chatty this evening.

790
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,240
JACK: The fact is,
I'm about to start shivering,

791
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:08,880
and making conversation
keeps my face from freezing.

792
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:15,080
Thank you. I had a good time.

793
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:20,160
-It's slippery here. Come on.
-I'm fine.

794
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:22,000
We got this far,
I'll take you the rest of the way.

795
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:24,360
LUCY: You gotta watch out. A little icy.

796
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:27,160
So you gonna go see Peter tomorrow?

797
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:29,680
(GRUNTING)

798
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,600
-All right.
-Do not take me with you.

799
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:37,360
-No, it's all right. Not too bad.
-You got it? Good? Okay.

800
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:39,640
(GRUNTING AND LAUGHING)

801
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:46,520
This is big.

802
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:49,000
-There we go. All right.
-Okay.

803
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:06,680
-All right?
-Yeah.

804
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:10,960
I think we're all right now.
Yeah. Let's just move this way.

805
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:12,320
This way.

806
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:14,080
-Whoa. Ow.
-Ow.

807
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:15,840
What was that?

808
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:18,000
Oh. Was that my pants or my muscles?

809
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:20,720
Oh, give me your hand.
Give me your hand.

810
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:22,480
-Whoa.
-Okay.

811
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:29,560
Oh, man.

812
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:33,000
Do you have an extra pair of pants
in your apartment?

813
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:35,080
If you fit into my pants, I will kill myself.

814
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:39,040
-You don't have to follow me.
-No, you're blocking the wind.

815
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:40,440
(LAUGHING)

816
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:50,000
I'll wait till you get inside.

817
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:51,760
Well, good night.

818
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:55,000
Night.

819
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:00,080
-I'll see you when I see you?
-Yeah.

820
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:21,880
All right, Lucy, it's either me or him.

821
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:23,120
Him.

822
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:29,360
You don't have to answer right away.

823
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:55,800
I'm having an affair. I like Jack.

824
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:57,280
Who's Jack?

825
00:53:57,560 --> 00:53:59,160
-Peter's brother.
-So?

826
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:01,440
-So he thinks I'm engaged.
-To who?

827
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:02,880
To Peter.

828
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:06,920
Lucy, I really don't have time for this.

829
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:10,040
Oh, no, no, no.
You have to tell me what to do.

830
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:11,680
Tell the truth.

831
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:15,240
If I tell Jack that I lied to his family,
he will never speak to me again.

832
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:19,760
And Ox and Midge and Mary and Saul.

833
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:22,240
Saul? Who's Saul?

834
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:26,560
He's the next-door neighbor.
But you know what? Actually, he knows.

835
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:29,240
Lucy, you're born into a family.

836
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:31,720
You do not join them
like you do the Marines.

837
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:35,240
You have to tell me what to do.

838
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:37,680
Pull the plug.

839
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:40,240
-You are sick.
-I'm sick?

840
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:42,880
You're cheating on a vegetable.

841
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,880
JACK: Down and dirty.

842
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:51,200
Are you gonna fold?

843
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:53,880
You're not gonna fold?

844
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:57,440
He is staying in with a pair.

845
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:00,720
Very impressive. Very bold, confident.

846
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:03,400
Full house.

847
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:06,720
You are unlucky at cards.

848
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:10,520
But lucky in love.

849
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:18,080
Remember in, like, fifth or sixth grade,

850
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:20,880
I was starting to get really good
at poker,

851
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:23,680
and going home
with lots of lunch money?

852
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:27,400
I got to know the principal's office
really well.

853
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:30,320
He always used to say to me,

854
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:33,920
"How come you can't be more
like your brother Peter?"

855
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:39,680
Well, you know what?
I was all right with that.

856
00:55:40,120 --> 00:55:42,920
I had no problems with that,
because I was proud of you.

857
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:47,000
And I was never envious
of anything that you had.

858
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:54,000
Until now.

859
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:01,280
I'll cut the deck.

860
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:04,440
High card gets Lucy.

861
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:14,960
All right, we'll go best out of three.

862
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:18,160
So, Lucy, have you and Peter decided

863
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:20,200
where you're gonna go
on your honeymoon?

864
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:21,800
I went to Cuba.

865
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:24,320
Ricky Ricardo was Cuban.

866
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:26,600
Didn't Peter look great today?

867
00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:27,920
SAUL: Oh, that kid.

868
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:29,280
You know, he should've been an actor.

869
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:30,400
He's tall.

870
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:32,240
All the great ones were tall.

871
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:35,680
Lucy, you think you can find me
a nice girl for Jack?

872
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:37,200
Oh, Mom, come on.

873
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:40,840
Well, I really don't know Jack's type,
so I'm not one to...

874
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:43,480
I like blonds. Chubby ones.

875
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:48,200
Alan Ladd wasn't tall.

876
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:50,480
Marshal Dillon was 6'5".

877
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:53,760
MIDGE: Well, we all know
who Lucy's type is.

878
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:56,880
These mashed potatoes are so creamy.

879
00:56:57,920 --> 00:56:59,400
You like brunettes.

880
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:02,800
I could never make a good pot roast.

881
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:04,040
You need good beef.

882
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:08,360
Argentina has great beef.
Beef and Nazis.

883
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:10,600
John Wayne was tall.

884
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:12,680
Dustin Hoffman was 5'6".

885
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:15,720
Would you wanna see Dustin Hoffman
save the Alamo?

886
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:17,560
MIDGE: These mashed potatoes
are so creamy.

887
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:19,760
OX: Spain has good beef.
MIDGE: Mary mashed them.

888
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:23,120
-SAUL: Cesar Romero was tall.
-Cesar Romero was not Spanish.

889
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:25,320
I didn't say Cesar Romero was Spanish.

890
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:26,680
Well, what did you say?

891
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:28,440
I said Cesar Romero was tall.

892
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:30,560
ELSIE: We all know he's tall.
SAUL: Well, that's what I said.

893
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:33,000
Cesar Romero was tall. That's all I said.

894
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:36,400
LUCY: So if you need any help
with history, don't call me.

895
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:40,320
Now, remember, honey, if you're free
for New Year's, we wanna see you.

896
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:41,760
-Thank you very much.
-Yeah.

897
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:43,560
-I had a great time. Thank you.
-Us, too.

898
00:57:43,640 --> 00:57:45,600
-Bye.
-Bye-bye, Lucy.

899
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:48,040
Hey, look, you guys.
You're under the mistletoe.

900
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:49,440
Ooh!

901
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:52,560
-Kiss her then. It's mistletoe.
-SAUL: Yeah.

902
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:54,000
-It's tradition.
-JACK: It's Christmas.

903
00:57:54,360 --> 00:57:56,480
Come on, idiot, kiss her.

904
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:01,720
SAUL: There you go.
OX: Oh, yeah.

905
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:03,640
-Good night.
-Bye.

-MARY: Ma.

909

MIDGE: I don't wanna hear
any excuses.

910
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:13,480
SAUL: Since the first year, I remember.

912
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:27,600

913
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:30,840
Oh, my God, Mary,
what are you doing here?

914
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:33,480
Hi. You wanna come through?

915
00:58:33,560 --> 00:58:35,400
-We can?
-Yeah, absolutely.

-I'm Mary. This is Beth.
-Hi.

Mary's my, um...

922
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:47,840
Lucy's going to marry my brother Peter.

CELESTE: What?
Lucy, you're getting married?

924
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:52,800
LUCY: Well, it hasn't
really been announced.

925
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:57,360
So it's a little awkward
for me to say anything, and, um...

926
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:00,560
-The train is here.
-Train. Okay, I'll see you later.

927
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:03,360
Thank you for coming.
It's nice to meet you, Beth.

Girl, are you pregnant?

929

LUCY: Yes, I'm pregnant, Celeste.

930
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:08,840
Lucy, you're not telling me
what's going on.

931
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:11,040
You're not giving me details.
What's going on?

932
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:13,560
Celeste, you have to have sex
in order to be pregnant.

933
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:15,120
But I thought you were engaged.

934
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:18,880
Well, we're waiting.

935
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:22,000

SAUL: I love a clarinet.

945
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:46,000
You know, nobody plays the clarinet
anymore.

946
00:59:46,080 --> 00:59:48,960
Guy Lombardo didn't play the clarinet.

947
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:51,440
I didn't say Guy Lombardo
played the clarinet.

01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:42,600
I could move in here.

off the rent.

-Peter's brother.

-Yeah.

-No, Peter.

01:02:44,520 --> 01:02:45,960
Peter doesn't even know you exist.

1015
01:02:46,040 --> 01:02:48,480
-I know.
-So Jack is Peter?

1016
01:02:48,560 --> 01:02:49,560
Yeah.

1017
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:51,040
-Lucy.
-Yeah?

1018
01:02:51,120 --> 01:02:53,800
They have doctors for this kind of thing.

1019
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:57,280
JACK: Hey.

1020
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,720
-That's spiked.
-Thank God.

1021
01:02:59,840 --> 01:03:02,360
-You shouldn't have any.
-Why not?

1022
01:03:03,080 --> 01:03:04,960
Because it's not good for the baby.

1023
01:03:07,320 --> 01:03:08,800
JACK: Wait a minute, will you?

1024
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:10,680
MAN 1: It's freezing.
MAN 2: Watch out, watch out.

1025
01:03:10,760 --> 01:03:13,880
This whole evening did not work out
well at all, and...

1026
01:03:14,120 --> 01:03:17,080
Oh, and I'm supposed to share
some responsibility in that?

1027
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:20,520
No. Would you slow down a little bit?

1028
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:24,800
Look, it was just a misunderstanding,

1029
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:26,640
and on top of the Joe Jr. thing...

1030
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:27,720
Excuse me?

1031
01:03:28,920 --> 01:03:30,080
It's nothing.

1032
01:03:30,200 --> 01:03:33,160
No, no, no, there's no nothing now.
What Joe Jr. thing?

1033
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:36,080
The leaning thing.

1034
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:37,440
The leaning thing?

1035
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:38,760
-Yeah.
-Okay.

1036
01:03:41,080 --> 01:03:44,480
What do you mean by the leaning...
Because he gave me flowers?

1037
01:03:44,560 --> 01:03:46,640
And then you leaned.

1038
01:03:46,720 --> 01:03:49,000
-And then I leaned.
-Yeah.

1039
01:03:49,080 --> 01:03:51,520
Okay. How did I lean when I leaned?

1040
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:52,640
-How were you leaning?
-Yeah.

1041
01:03:52,720 --> 01:03:55,200
It was a lot different than hugging.
Hugging's very different.

1042
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:58,000
Hugging, that involves arms and hands,

1043
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:02,760
and leaning is whole bodies
moving in like this.

1044
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:06,400
Leaning involves wanting

1045
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:11,440
and accepting, leaning.

1046
01:04:14,320 --> 01:04:15,880
Hey, Luce.

1047
01:04:16,600 --> 01:04:18,600
Is this guy bothering you?

1048
01:04:21,160 --> 01:04:22,960
No, no.

1049
01:04:23,040 --> 01:04:27,440
Are you sure?
Because it looks like he's leaning.

1050
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:30,880
Thank you. See?

1051
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:34,920
JOE JR.: I'll be right over here
if you need me.

1052
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:37,000
Okay, thank you very much.

1053
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:38,760
I know karate.

1054
01:04:44,680 --> 01:04:46,320
Okay, is... Ahem!

1055
01:04:47,360 --> 01:04:49,200
Now, all right,
what about the other thing?

1056
01:04:49,320 --> 01:04:51,360
The other thing?
The other misunderstanding?

1057
01:04:52,600 --> 01:04:54,320
Why did you think I was pregnant?

1058
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:58,000
Well, Mary said that she had heard
something like that.

1059
01:04:59,320 --> 01:05:00,760
And you believed her?

1060
01:05:01,040 --> 01:05:03,000
I didn't have any reason
not to believe her.

1061
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,560
So the only reason your brother
would wanna marry someone like me

1062
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:07,960
is if I was pregnant, right?

1063
01:05:08,040 --> 01:05:09,600
No, no.

1064
01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:14,800
Good night.

1065
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,080
The fact is,
you're not really Peter's type.

1066
01:05:19,400 --> 01:05:21,560
Yeah, Jack? All right. Whose type am I?

1067
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:28,160
-Thank you.
-Look, it's a great idea, you and Peter.

1068
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:29,920
It's just not obvious
to the whole world, that's all.

1069
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:33,000
You know what, Jack?
I've had a really lousy Christmas.

1070
01:05:33,120 --> 01:05:34,560
You've just managed
to kill my New Year's.

1071
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:37,400
If you come back on Easter,
you can burn down my apartment.

1072
01:05:37,480 --> 01:05:40,760
-JACK: Hey, come on, Lucy.
-What do you want from me, Jack?

1073
01:05:41,120 --> 01:05:43,160
I want you not to be unhappy.

1074
01:05:43,240 --> 01:05:45,320
And what are you,
the happiness guru, Jack?

1075
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:46,440
Are you happy?

1076
01:05:46,520 --> 01:05:49,320
I don't remember you having
had a conversation with your father.

1077
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:50,920
You wanna leave the business,
don't you?

1078
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:54,200
Is this just another miscommunication
that we are having here?

1079
01:05:54,280 --> 01:05:56,040
What do you know about my family?

1080
01:05:56,120 --> 01:05:58,280
Spending a week with them
does not make you an expert.

1081
01:05:58,360 --> 01:06:01,120
Spending a lifetime with them
hasn't made you one either.

1082
01:06:04,280 --> 01:06:07,720
Yeah, well, I know that keeping
your family happy gets complicated.

1083
01:06:07,800 --> 01:06:10,800
Would your father be happy knowing
you're sitting in a token booth

1084
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:13,040
planning vacations
that you aren't taking?

1085
01:06:15,720 --> 01:06:19,120
No, he wouldn't. You're right.

1086
01:06:21,240 --> 01:06:23,640
But you have no idea
what it's like to be alone.

1087
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,160
Hey, you have Peter.

1088
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:28,480
I don't have anybody.

He's got amnesia.

1105
01:08:26,680 --> 01:08:29,120
Lacunar amnesia is a condition

1106
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:32,800
in which memory loss
is localized and patchy.

1107
01:08:33,040 --> 01:08:35,120
Limited to isolated events.

-Should I?
-Look closely.

-I think it's coming back.

Or when I accused you
of having a relationship with Joe Jr.

Life is a pain in the ass. I'll tell you.

1181
01:13:50,920 --> 01:13:54,720
You know, you work hard,
try to provide for the family,

1182
01:13:55,680 --> 01:13:59,200
and then for one minute,
everything's good.

1183
01:14:00,360 --> 01:14:03,720
Everyone's well, everyone's happy.

1184
01:14:04,200 --> 01:14:07,000
In that one minute, you have peace.

1185
01:14:09,240 --> 01:14:10,720
Pop.

1186
01:14:11,560 --> 01:14:13,480
This isn't that minute.

1187
01:14:15,360 --> 01:14:16,560
What do you mean?

1188
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:18,040
Um...

1189
01:14:21,720 --> 01:14:24,000
You remember that rocking chair
I made for Grandma?

1190
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:25,680
Are you kidding me?

1191
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:27,760
It's so fancy, she won't even sit in it.

1192
01:14:28,040 --> 01:14:31,360
This fancy chair, two months ago,
I sold three just like it.

1193
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:34,520
I've sold two dining tables.
I got orders for six more.

1194
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:36,720
Well, that's a good side business.

1195
01:14:37,120 --> 01:14:40,640
It's not a side business.
This is good business.

1196
01:14:44,200 --> 01:14:45,680
Wait a second.

1197
01:14:46,720 --> 01:14:48,280
You don't want my business?

1198
01:14:52,240 --> 01:14:54,080
No, I don't.

1199
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:04,000
-How long have you felt this way?
-A long time.

1200
01:15:05,320 --> 01:15:07,560
Well, why didn't you say
something sooner?

1201
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:12,760
I could have sold the whole damn thing
to Uncle Eddy for twice its value.

1202
01:15:13,440 --> 01:15:16,280
I could have taken your mother
on the cruise with Kathie Lee Gifford.

1203
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:19,640
You're not mad at me?

1204
01:15:19,880 --> 01:15:21,640
Are you nuts?

1205
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:25,040
You are nuts.
You wanna make rocking chairs.

1206
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:30,280
Hey, Mrs. Fletcher finally went, huh?

1207
01:15:30,720 --> 01:15:33,280
Her dining room alone
has got to be worth 40 grand.

1208
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:35,520
Yeah. Those McMurphy boys,

1209
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:37,840
they were moving in
before the deed was done.

1210
01:15:38,120 --> 01:15:39,600
That's their problem. They're too pushy.

1211
01:15:39,680 --> 01:15:41,960
-They're pushy, aren't they?
-We'll call them next week.

1212
01:15:42,240 --> 01:15:43,760
You call them next week.

1213
01:15:44,360 --> 01:15:47,080
That's right, I'll call them next week.

1214
01:15:47,200 --> 01:15:48,200
Yeah.

1215
01:15:48,280 --> 01:15:50,560
-Do I get a donut?
-I'm sorry.

1216
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:55,200
22, 10, 40.
Eighth-grade locker combination.

1217
01:15:55,320 --> 01:15:56,960
Birth date, 3-11-59.

1218
01:15:57,040 --> 01:15:58,640
You have to remember Lucy.

1219
01:15:58,720 --> 01:16:01,880
Social security number, 144-60-6894.

1220
01:16:01,960 --> 01:16:05,320
You love her. You just don't remember.

1221
01:16:05,480 --> 01:16:08,320
Three-point-seven-three grade point
average, Northwestern University.

1222
01:16:08,600 --> 01:16:09,960
Can I talk to Peter alone?

1223
01:16:10,160 --> 01:16:13,480
-Everything okay, Saul?
-Senior class president, 1981.

1224
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:15,160
I just wanna talk to my godson.

1225
01:16:15,800 --> 01:16:16,880
-MIDGE: Let me take that for you.
-Thanks.

1226
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:18,560
OX: We'll be back.
MIDGE: We'll see you later.

1227
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,160
-You sure, Saul?
-Yeah, yeah, sure.

1228
01:16:21,280 --> 01:16:22,760
-OX: See you, son.
-See you, Dad.

1229
01:16:25,200 --> 01:16:27,640
Peter, I've known you
since you were born.

1230
01:16:27,720 --> 01:16:31,720
I've been to every major event
in your life from Cub Scouts to...

1231
01:16:32,200 --> 01:16:35,080
Well, to the day you discovered
hair on your schmeckel.

1232
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:38,160
You've got a good education.

1233
01:16:38,520 --> 01:16:40,960
You're very popular
with all those friends of yours.

1234
01:16:41,120 --> 01:16:43,040
You make a nice living.

1235
01:16:43,280 --> 01:16:46,000
And everybody knows
you're a good-looking kid.

1236
01:16:47,360 --> 01:16:50,480
But, Peter, you're a putz.

1237
01:16:51,560 --> 01:16:52,600
Excuse me?

1238
01:16:53,080 --> 01:16:55,480
Now, look, I'm your godfather.
I mean, I love you.

1239
01:16:55,560 --> 01:16:58,200
I couldn't love you any more
if you were my own son.

1240
01:16:59,800 --> 01:17:02,040
But the fact of the matter is you're...

1241
01:17:02,240 --> 01:17:03,720
Well, you're a putz.

1242
01:17:05,640 --> 01:17:07,040
Is there a point to this?

1243
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:09,360
Lucy.

1244
01:17:11,680 --> 01:17:14,880
Peter, there's something
you have to know about her.

1245
01:17:16,160 --> 01:17:17,720
You see, she...

1246
01:17:19,360 --> 01:17:20,600
Well...

1247
01:17:21,440 --> 01:17:22,560
Uh...

1248
01:17:23,720 --> 01:17:24,960
She's...

1249
01:17:27,320 --> 01:17:28,600
You know...

1250
01:17:30,720 --> 01:17:34,240
She's not only your fiancée,
she's your guardian angel.

1251
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:37,600
Yeah. Peter, she saved your life.

1252
01:17:38,920 --> 01:17:40,760
Now, she's coming to see you today,

1253
01:17:41,080 --> 01:17:42,920
and I want you to do yourself a favor.

1254
01:17:43,880 --> 01:17:46,760
I want you to look deeply into her eyes
and listen with the heart of a man

1255
01:17:46,840 --> 01:17:49,160
who has just been given
a second chance at life.

1256
01:17:50,360 --> 01:17:53,880
And after two minutes,
if you're not madly in love with her,

1257
01:17:54,320 --> 01:17:56,760
why, tell her you wanna break up.

1258
01:17:57,480 --> 01:17:59,160
And you can go back to being a putz.

1259
01:17:59,960 --> 01:18:00,960
But if in the two minutes,

1260
01:18:01,040 --> 01:18:03,760
you see what the rest of us
only took seconds to see,

1261
01:18:04,520 --> 01:18:07,200
you will propose to her
for the second time,

1262
01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:10,000
and marry her
before she has a chance to escape.

1263
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:17,520
Before she comes, take a little time

1264
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:21,160
and think about
what an old putz just told you.

1265
01:18:21,320 --> 01:18:22,640
All right?

1266
01:18:26,280 --> 01:18:30,120
You know, if I was 40 years younger,
I'd marry her myself.

1267
01:18:31,160 --> 01:18:32,680
That is, if she'd convert.

1268
01:18:33,240 --> 01:18:35,920
-Hey, that's a joke.
-Oh, I know.

1269
01:18:58,480 --> 01:18:59,640
Lucy.

1270
01:19:00,200 --> 01:19:02,040
-Hi.
-Hi.

1271
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:03,880
Um...

1272
01:19:05,560 --> 01:19:07,920
I came to bring you back your things.

1273
01:19:08,760 --> 01:19:09,960
Would you like a sandwich?

1274
01:19:12,920 --> 01:19:15,240
No, no. I'm okay, thanks.

1275
01:19:16,040 --> 01:19:17,640
Can I get you anything?

1276
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:19,400
I wish I had my own clothes.

1277
01:19:19,680 --> 01:19:21,680
Well, I like your blue pinstripe.

1278
01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:23,080
-Double-breasted?
-Yeah.

1279
01:19:23,320 --> 01:19:24,760
-That's my favorite.
-Really?

1280
01:19:24,840 --> 01:19:25,960
Yeah.

1281
01:19:28,400 --> 01:19:29,480
Please sit down.

1282
01:19:40,280 --> 01:19:44,960
I saw a picture of you
when you saved the three squirrels.

1283
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:48,000
They never call, they never write.

1284
01:19:48,320 --> 01:19:49,920
That was a long time ago.

1285
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:53,600
Yeah, I guess we don't get to do
many heroic things as an adult.

1286
01:19:53,960 --> 01:19:55,720
Oh, that's for sure.

1287
01:19:56,400 --> 01:19:57,640
You do, though.

1288
01:19:57,840 --> 01:20:01,360
Oh, no. Jumping in front of that train
was unusual.

1289
01:20:02,120 --> 01:20:05,520
I don't think I've done anything
truly heroic my whole life.

1290
01:20:06,840 --> 01:20:08,440
I chased a purse snatcher once.

1291
01:20:08,720 --> 01:20:10,440
Well, that's something.

1292
01:20:10,520 --> 01:20:12,280
I pretended to pull a hamstring.

1293
01:20:13,880 --> 01:20:16,760
Well, most guys probably wouldn't have
chased after him in the first place.

1294
01:20:16,840 --> 01:20:19,040
I mean, I work at the L.
Believe me, I know.

1295
01:20:21,040 --> 01:20:23,320
You give up your seat
every day in the train.

1296
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:24,960
Well...

1297
01:20:26,080 --> 01:20:27,320
That's not heroic.

1298
01:20:27,520 --> 01:20:29,880
It is to the person who sits in it.

1299
01:20:31,240 --> 01:20:35,160
And you always gave me something
to look forward to every day, so...

1300
01:20:37,040 --> 01:20:39,080
You know, you do remind me
of someone.

1301
01:20:41,360 --> 01:20:42,880
It's probably you.

1302
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:54,560
Excuse me. Excuse me, ma'am.
What apartment?

1303
01:20:56,080 --> 01:20:59,040
-You're new.
-Yes, ma'am. What apartment?

1304
01:20:59,160 --> 01:21:00,960
I'm going to Peter Callaghan's
apartment.

1305
01:21:01,040 --> 01:21:02,640
And your name, please?

1306
01:21:02,720 --> 01:21:05,560
Ashley Bartlett Bacon.
I am Peter's fiancée.

1307
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:07,240
(CHUCKLING)

1308
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:09,680
You're not his fiancée.

1309
01:21:10,440 --> 01:21:11,760
-Huh?
-Huh?

1310
01:21:12,840 --> 01:21:14,080
Hey, looking good.

1311
01:21:14,160 --> 01:21:16,320
Yeah, well, they're moving me
to the second floor.

1312
01:21:16,400 --> 01:21:18,680
Great. Mind if I drove?

1313
01:21:18,760 --> 01:21:21,000
No problem. See you by the elevators.

1314
01:21:21,080 --> 01:21:23,440
All right. Okay. There we go.

1315
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:26,440
It's a little drafty.

1316
01:21:26,520 --> 01:21:29,040
Here, I brought you some contraband.

1317
01:21:30,320 --> 01:21:32,720
Chocolate peanut butter. Thanks.

1318
01:21:32,840 --> 01:21:35,320
Hey, Lucy's pretty terrific, isn't she?

1319
01:21:35,400 --> 01:21:37,760
-Oh, yeah.
-We're engaged, you know.

1320
01:21:38,320 --> 01:21:40,520
-Yeah, I heard that.
-Mmm.

1321
01:21:41,480 --> 01:21:43,440
Now, this, I remember.

1322
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:46,680
Everything is better.
Everything looks better, feels better.

1323
01:21:47,960 --> 01:21:50,000
Even this chocolate peanut
butter tastes better.

1324
01:21:50,560 --> 01:21:52,760
Good. It's fudge mint.

1325
01:21:53,360 --> 01:21:55,520
Whatever. I'm reborn.

1326
01:21:55,960 --> 01:21:58,240
If you were a priest right now,
I'd confess everything to you.

1327
01:21:58,680 --> 01:22:00,880
No, no, don't confess.
I'm trying to be positive right now.

1328
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:02,520
Just eat your ice cream.

1329
01:22:02,600 --> 01:22:05,080
I don't know what my secretary
sent Mom and Dad for Christmas.

1330
01:22:05,280 --> 01:22:07,120
It was a fruit basket.
Now, look, I don't wanna...

1331
01:22:07,200 --> 01:22:09,640
-I've never been faithful.
-I'm gonna leave.

1332
01:22:10,040 --> 01:22:11,960
Remember the squirrels?

1333
01:22:12,600 --> 01:22:14,320
Don't even say it.

1334
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:18,480
First I knocked them out of their nest
with a rock.

1335
01:22:19,800 --> 01:22:20,960
Peter.

1336
01:22:21,200 --> 01:22:22,680
Then I saved them.

1337
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:24,000
Eh!

1338
01:22:24,440 --> 01:22:25,840
Did you say any of this to Lucy?

1339
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:28,600
That was in the past.
I'm making a clean start with Lucy.

1340
01:22:28,680 --> 01:22:32,920
She is... She is... She...

1341
01:22:35,440 --> 01:22:37,320
What is she? She's...

1342
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:40,920
I'd say that she gets under your skin
as soon as you meet her.

1343
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:42,240
She drives you so nuts,

1344
01:22:42,320 --> 01:22:46,320
you don't know whether to hug her
or just really arm-wrestle her.

1345
01:22:47,040 --> 01:22:50,800
She would go all the way to Europe
just to get a stamp in her passport.

1346
01:22:51,360 --> 01:22:53,720
I don't know if that amounts to insanity

1347
01:22:53,800 --> 01:22:57,560
or just being really, really likeable.

1348
01:23:00,360 --> 01:23:02,040
No, that's not it.

1349
01:23:02,960 --> 01:23:05,680
But she's gotta be really special.
She's gotta be.

1350
01:23:06,280 --> 01:23:09,280
And I can spend the rest of my life
finding out why.

1351
01:23:10,160 --> 01:23:12,880
I don't have to know now,
I don't have to know tomorrow.

1352
01:23:13,400 --> 01:23:16,800
I don't have to know in a year,
or 10 years.

1353
01:23:17,360 --> 01:23:19,120
I don't have to...

1354
01:23:19,200 --> 01:23:21,040
I don't have to have
all the answers today, or...

1355
01:23:21,120 --> 01:23:22,400
Maybe someday I'll have a clue,

1356
01:23:22,480 --> 01:23:26,200
but it doesn't mean
I can't make a lifetime commitment.

1357
01:23:27,120 --> 01:23:29,360
Does this make any sense?

1358
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:32,880
Not really,
but that's common after a head injury.

1359
01:23:33,680 --> 01:23:34,720
My shoes.

1360
01:23:37,240 --> 01:23:39,400
-Oh, hi.
-What'd they say?

1361
01:23:39,800 --> 01:23:42,240
-Who?
-The Callaghans. Are they inside?

1362
01:23:42,520 --> 01:23:44,120
You missed them.

1363
01:23:44,400 --> 01:23:46,400
Well, what was their reaction
to the news?

1364
01:23:46,880 --> 01:23:49,680
-I didn't tell them yet.
-What do you mean, Saul?

1365
01:23:49,760 --> 01:23:52,680
-Now, what about Peter?
-Well, I didn't tell him either.

1366
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:54,440
What? You said
you were gonna handle this.

1367
01:23:54,520 --> 01:23:56,160
-I'll handle it.
-This is handling it?

1368
01:23:56,240 --> 01:23:57,720
-This is handling it.
-Saul.

1369
01:23:57,800 --> 01:23:59,120
-What?
-You're fired.

1370
01:24:00,240 --> 01:24:01,400
Fired?

1371
01:24:01,640 --> 01:24:03,160
-Sorry.
-Pardon me.

1372
01:24:04,960 --> 01:24:06,040
Huh!

1373
01:24:11,520 --> 01:24:13,160
-Two, please.
-Four, please.

1374
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:28,320
WOMAN ON PA:
<i>Dr. Biloxi, Dr. Biloxi to ICU North.</i>

1375
01:24:28,400 --> 01:24:32,040
<i>Dr. Biloxi, Dr. Biloxi to ICU North.</i>

1376
01:24:32,480 --> 01:24:34,120
-Thanks.
-NURSE: You're welcome.

1377
01:24:35,280 --> 01:24:37,080
-PETER: Ashley.
-Scumbag.

1378
01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:39,480
You're engaged?

1379
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:44,680
May I remind you
that you proposed to me?

1380
01:24:44,760 --> 01:24:46,480
You said no. We broke up.

1381
01:24:46,880 --> 01:24:50,040
No, no. I was confused.
We stepped back.

1382
01:24:50,120 --> 01:24:51,480
You moved to Portugal.

1383
01:24:51,640 --> 01:24:54,040
Yes, well, I didn't think
you were going to run out

1384
01:24:54,120 --> 01:24:56,520
and marry the first bimbo
that you came across.

1385
01:24:56,600 --> 01:24:57,680
Lucy's not a bimbo.

1386
01:24:57,840 --> 01:24:59,800
Lucy? Lucy who?

1387
01:25:01,240 --> 01:25:02,320
I don't remember.

1388
01:25:02,400 --> 01:25:03,680
Liar.

1389
01:25:04,720 --> 01:25:08,160
I don't remember proposing.
I was in a coma, I have amnesia.

1390
01:25:09,160 --> 01:25:12,000
Amnesia? Oh, well, now, that's rich.

1391
01:25:12,360 --> 01:25:14,800
All right, fine. I want my stuff back.

1392
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:16,000
Fine.

1393
01:25:16,080 --> 01:25:18,280
-Then I want my stuff back.
-What stuff?

1394
01:25:18,600 --> 01:25:19,840
Your nose.

1395
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:22,640
You can't take my nose back.

1396
01:25:22,800 --> 01:25:24,000
I paid for it.

1397
01:25:24,360 --> 01:25:26,840
Well, then here. You paid for these, too.

1398
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,640
Keep them. I'm a changed man, Ashley.

1399
01:25:31,840 --> 01:25:36,920
Go ahead. Go ahead and marry her,
you one-balled bastard.

1400
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:45,880
Holy buckets, Peter.
Moving on to greener pastures.

1401
01:25:46,720 --> 01:25:48,000
Yeah.

1402
01:25:48,080 --> 01:25:49,360
You got it, pal.

1403
01:25:49,680 --> 01:25:51,920
MAN: So we should come back later?
WOMAN: Yes, the doctor...

1404
01:25:52,320 --> 01:25:54,240
-Lucy, they moved him.
-They moved him?

1405
01:25:54,320 --> 01:25:56,320
Come with me, downstairs.

1406
01:25:57,320 --> 01:25:58,640
Lucy.

1407
01:25:59,040 --> 01:26:00,280
What? Oh!

1408
01:26:01,360 --> 01:26:03,000
-Lucy.
-Hi, Peter.

1409
01:26:03,080 --> 01:26:04,200
My God, you look really good.

1410
01:26:04,280 --> 01:26:06,840
I feel really good. You know what?

1411
01:26:07,520 --> 01:26:09,960
Facing death makes a man
evaluate his life.

1412
01:26:10,480 --> 01:26:12,920
And I've been thinking about mine
and haven't liked what I've seen.

1413
01:26:13,120 --> 01:26:15,720
I've seen a man who has
courtside tickets to the Bulls,

1414
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:18,040
a lucrative investment portfolio.

1415
01:26:18,320 --> 01:26:21,360
An apartment
on la rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré.

1416
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:23,120
-Where?
-Paris.

1417
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,440
But I've also seen a man
who has no one to trust,

1418
01:26:26,520 --> 01:26:28,400
no one to wanna have a son with.

1419
01:26:28,640 --> 01:26:31,080
You were there when I needed
someone the most.

1420
01:26:31,560 --> 01:26:33,280
You gave me a second chance at life.

1421
01:26:34,400 --> 01:26:38,080
It took a coma to wake me up.
My family loves you.

1422
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:41,360
I might as well love you.

1423
01:26:41,800 --> 01:26:43,160
Lucy Eleanor Moderatz,

1424
01:26:44,920 --> 01:26:46,160
will you marry me?

1425
01:26:49,120 --> 01:26:51,160
NURSE: Wanda?
Wanda, are you all right?

1426
01:26:51,240 --> 01:26:52,320
Um...

1427
01:26:52,400 --> 01:26:53,920
NURSE: Honey? Wanda?

1428
01:26:54,200 --> 01:26:56,400
JOE JR.: Your hair is looking
very big tonight.

1429
01:26:56,480 --> 01:26:59,480
PHYLLIS: Why, thank you.
I love your new cologne.

1430
01:26:59,560 --> 01:27:02,160
Yeah, it's called Paris Guy.
It's from France.

1431
01:27:02,280 --> 01:27:03,360
-Ooh, nice.
-How you doing?

1432
01:27:03,440 --> 01:27:05,720
-Hey, are you going to see Lucy?
-Yeah.

1433
01:27:07,240 --> 01:27:09,520
She is the best-looking chick
in this building.

1434
01:27:09,600 --> 01:27:10,640
Hey.

1435
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:16,200
But you are the best-looking chick
on the third floor.

1436
01:27:16,280 --> 01:27:18,680
-Joe Jr.
-Phyllis.

1437
01:27:25,240 --> 01:27:26,480
No? This one?

1438
01:27:28,080 --> 01:27:29,040
This one?

1439

(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

1440
01:27:31,640 --> 01:27:33,640
I don't want any flowers from you,

1441
01:27:33,720 --> 01:27:35,840
I am not wearing black underwear,

1442
01:27:35,920 --> 01:27:38,600
and I definitely do not wanna
move in with you...

1443
01:27:40,040 --> 01:27:41,120
Jack.

1444
01:27:41,680 --> 01:27:43,200
Well, I don't have any flowers,

1445
01:27:43,320 --> 01:27:44,840
I wouldn't mind
seeing the black underwear,

1446
01:27:44,920 --> 01:27:48,160
but under the circumstances, I don't
think we should move in together.

1447
01:27:49,320 --> 01:27:50,760
(CHUCKLING)

1448
01:27:51,560 --> 01:27:55,240
-I thought you were Joe Jr.
-I get that a lot.

1449
01:27:58,640 --> 01:28:00,440
Do you wanna come in?

1450
01:28:00,640 --> 01:28:01,840
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

1451
01:28:10,200 --> 01:28:13,000
Wow. So that's the wedding dress, huh?

1452
01:28:13,360 --> 01:28:15,040
-Hmm?
-The wedding dress.

1453
01:28:16,400 --> 01:28:18,920
It works good as a tie, too.

1454
01:28:21,800 --> 01:28:22,960
Yeah.

1455
01:28:23,280 --> 01:28:24,640
I just wanted to give you this

1456
01:28:24,720 --> 01:28:27,360
before all the presents
started to pile up.

1457
01:28:28,520 --> 01:28:31,280
I was dropping off some furniture
in Little Italy,

1458
01:28:31,360 --> 01:28:33,280
I look in a window, and...

1459
01:28:38,960 --> 01:28:40,040
Florence.

1460
01:28:40,920 --> 01:28:42,200
Florence.

1461
01:28:46,200 --> 01:28:49,160
Thank you. It's really beautiful.

1462
01:28:52,280 --> 01:28:55,600
And I wanted to say that I think that

1463
01:28:55,960 --> 01:28:59,880
Peter is a very lucky guy.

1464
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:04,360
Thank you.

1465
01:29:04,520 --> 01:29:07,040
I had to say that because
you're gonna be my sister-in-law.

1466
01:29:07,600 --> 01:29:08,960
Ha, ha, ha.

1467
01:29:09,520 --> 01:29:13,040
I guess we'll be seeing
a lot of each other then.

1468
01:29:19,280 --> 01:29:21,160
-I'd better get going.
-Yeah.

1469
01:29:24,400 --> 01:29:26,360
LUCY: Hey, Jack?

1470
01:29:26,720 --> 01:29:28,760
-Jack.
-Yeah?

1471
01:29:30,840 --> 01:29:35,160
Can you give me any reason
why I shouldn't marry your brother?

1472
01:29:42,240 --> 01:29:43,520
I can't.

1473
01:30:05,760 --> 01:30:08,360
-What's this?
-It's a wedding invitation.

1474
01:30:08,440 --> 01:30:12,120
Wait a minute.
This is your wedding invitation.

1475
01:30:12,440 --> 01:30:13,520
So?

1476
01:30:14,920 --> 01:30:16,720
Whom are we marrying?

1477
01:30:17,080 --> 01:30:19,840
Jerry, Peter Callaghan.

1478
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,720
The coma guy? Are you insane?

1479
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:24,280
Yes, Jerry, I'm insane.

1480
01:30:24,560 --> 01:30:27,720
Every day I go and I sit in a booth
like a veal.

1481
01:30:27,800 --> 01:30:31,320
I work every holiday, I go home to a cat.

1482
01:30:31,400 --> 01:30:34,680
And now a rich and handsome man
has asked me to marry him,

1483
01:30:34,760 --> 01:30:35,880
and I have said yes.

1484
01:30:35,960 --> 01:30:39,160
Okay, okay, that makes me
a raving, total lunatic.

1485
01:30:39,240 --> 01:30:41,280
The wedding is tomorrow, Lucy.

1486
01:30:41,360 --> 01:30:44,600
I know it's tomorrow, Jerry.
But I even wish it were yesterday.

1487
01:30:44,680 --> 01:30:48,000
That would mean that today
that I would be on my honeymoon,

1488
01:30:48,120 --> 01:30:50,360
that I would finally have a stamp
in my passport,

1489
01:30:50,440 --> 01:30:52,640
and that it would say Italy on it.

1490
01:30:56,240 --> 01:30:58,040
What happened with the other guy?

1491
01:31:00,720 --> 01:31:02,360
He didn't want me.

1492
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:19,040
-Maybe she forgot.
-A woman doesn't forget her wedding.

1493
01:31:19,400 --> 01:31:20,960
Maybe she's stuck in traffic.

1494
01:31:21,200 --> 01:31:23,520
-This isn't... Does this look ridiculous?
-No, you look fine.

1495
01:31:24,480 --> 01:31:26,600
-All right. Well, you got the rings?
-Yeah, I got the rings.

1496
01:31:26,680 --> 01:31:29,040
What's the matter with you, Jack?

1497
01:31:29,120 --> 01:31:30,840
You suck.

1498
01:31:33,680 --> 01:31:35,720
I suck or the outfit sucks?

1499
01:31:36,040 --> 01:31:37,600
It's a toss-up.

Oh, gee.

1508
01:32:43,760 --> 01:32:46,040
I didn't get to that part yet.

1509
01:32:46,360 --> 01:32:49,160
I would have to object, too.

He didn't do anything.
He didn't do anything.

1517
01:33:15,640 --> 01:33:17,640
It was me. It was all me.

1518
01:33:18,560 --> 01:33:21,120
Elsie, how are you doing?
You doing okay?

1519
01:33:22,480 --> 01:33:23,560
Um...

1520
01:33:23,880 --> 01:33:26,000
Do you remember
that day at the hospital?

1521
01:33:26,080 --> 01:33:27,800
Of course you remember
that day at the hospital.

1522
01:33:28,640 --> 01:33:30,680
Well, there was a little mix-up.

1523
01:33:30,880 --> 01:33:35,000
I saw Peter get pushed onto the tracks,
and I saved his life.

1524
01:33:35,480 --> 01:33:38,480
But when I got to the hospital,
they wouldn't let me see him,

1525
01:33:38,560 --> 01:33:44,160
so someone told the doctor
that I was his fiancée.

1526
01:33:44,760 --> 01:33:46,160
Only, um...

1527
01:33:47,560 --> 01:33:49,000
It's not true.

1528
01:33:52,240 --> 01:33:54,160
I was never engaged to Peter.

1529
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:03,200
Why didn't you say something?

1530
01:34:03,840 --> 01:34:05,440
Because I didn't know how to tell you.

1531
01:34:07,640 --> 01:34:10,480
We never even met
until that day on the tracks.

1532
01:34:11,960 --> 01:34:13,280
It's just when we were
in the hospital room,

1533
01:34:13,360 --> 01:34:16,880
everything happened so fast,
and I couldn't tell you the truth.

1534
01:34:16,960 --> 01:34:19,440
And then I didn't wanna
tell you the truth,

1535
01:34:19,520 --> 01:34:22,760
because the truth was that

1536
01:34:24,880 --> 01:34:26,480
I fell in love with you.

1537
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:28,040
You fell in love with me?

1538
01:34:28,640 --> 01:34:31,320
No. No. Yes. All of you.

1539
01:34:32,920 --> 01:34:37,280
I went from being all alone
to being a fiancée,

1540
01:34:37,760 --> 01:34:41,400
a daughter, a granddaughter, a sister,

1541
01:34:42,840 --> 01:34:44,360
and a friend.

1542
01:34:45,640 --> 01:34:48,280
I might have saved your life
on the tracks, but you know what?

1543
01:34:48,360 --> 01:34:50,240
You really saved mine.

1544
01:34:51,120 --> 01:34:53,320
You allowed me
to be a part of your family.

1545
01:34:53,720 --> 01:34:56,240
And I haven't had that
in a really long time.

1546
01:34:58,440 --> 01:35:00,560
And I just didn't wanna let go of that.

1547
01:35:04,040 --> 01:35:05,680
So even though
it was just for a little while,

1548
01:35:05,760 --> 01:35:07,760
I will love them always.

1549
01:35:11,960 --> 01:35:13,240
I'm very sorry.

1550
01:35:16,200 --> 01:35:17,480
Oh, um...

1551
01:35:18,200 --> 01:35:20,360
And I'm very sorry about your carpet.

1552
01:35:24,680 --> 01:35:25,800
What about my carpet?

1553
01:35:25,880 --> 01:35:28,280
Peter Callaghan is engaged to me.

1554
01:35:28,360 --> 01:35:30,000
I object to this wedding.

1555
01:35:30,120 --> 01:35:31,320
Get in line.

1556
01:35:31,440 --> 01:35:33,160
And I object to your objection.

1557
01:35:33,240 --> 01:35:34,280
Who's that?

1558
01:35:34,440 --> 01:35:35,720
Ashley's husband.

1559
01:35:36,040 --> 01:35:38,360
You proposed to a married woman?

1560
01:35:38,680 --> 01:35:42,280
Yes, and I was in a coma
when my brother makes a play for my...

1561
01:35:43,080 --> 01:35:44,120
Sort of my fiancée.

1562
01:35:44,200 --> 01:35:47,360
MIDGE: Peter, how could you do this?
PETER: Listen, a deal is a deal.

1563
01:35:47,800 --> 01:35:50,120
MAN: You two are better off together.

1564
01:35:51,760 --> 01:35:53,200
MARY: Stop yelling.

1565
01:35:55,800 --> 01:35:56,960
ASHLEY: Hey.

1566
01:35:57,080 --> 01:35:59,480
SAUL: Hold on.
Hold on, just hold it right there.

1567
01:36:11,800 --> 01:36:13,480
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

1568
01:36:23,160 --> 01:36:24,480
Hey, Luce.

1569
01:36:25,520 --> 01:36:29,000
I just wanted to say that I'm sorry

1570
01:36:29,080 --> 01:36:31,240
things didn't work out with that guy.

1571
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,960
And, you know, right now,
you should get in touch

1572
01:36:37,040 --> 01:36:38,520
with the child within

1573
01:36:40,400 --> 01:36:43,280
and explore your feminine side.

1574
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:48,360
And, you know, don't start eating
cookies and cake and stuff like that,

1575
01:36:48,440 --> 01:36:52,680
because you'll blow up
like my Aunt Roberta, you know?

1576
01:36:55,160 --> 01:36:56,840
You deserve better than that.

1577
01:37:04,880 --> 01:37:08,320
So how are things going
with Miss Third Floor?

1578
01:37:08,400 --> 01:37:09,600
Pfft!

1579
01:37:09,680 --> 01:37:10,880
She's...

1580
01:37:10,960 --> 01:37:12,200
(CRYING)

1581
01:37:14,360 --> 01:37:16,920
-Oh, Joey, Joey.
-She said that I...

1582
01:37:18,400 --> 01:37:20,760
-LUCY: What?
-Do you have any cookies?

1583
01:37:20,840 --> 01:37:22,480
LUCY: No. You know what?

1584
01:37:22,560 --> 01:37:24,880
-We can try on some of my shoes.
-JOE JR.: Okay.

1585
01:37:33,880 --> 01:37:36,560
-Hey. Last day, huh?
-Yeah.

1586
01:37:38,720 --> 01:37:40,760
-I'm gonna miss you.
-I'm gonna miss you.

1587
01:37:40,880 --> 01:37:42,080
-Oh, we'll see each other.
-You better.

1588
01:37:42,160 --> 01:37:43,600
-Of course.
-All right?

1589
01:37:44,800 --> 01:37:46,120
-Bye.
-See you.

1590
01:38:02,080 --> 01:38:03,480
Lucy?

1591
01:38:14,600 --> 01:38:16,320
I need to ask you a question.

1592
01:38:17,160 --> 01:38:20,600
ELSIE: Get down on your knee.
It's more romantic.

1593
01:38:20,840 --> 01:38:23,280
He's proposing. Let him do it.

1594
01:38:23,360 --> 01:38:25,600
I am letting him do it.

1595
01:38:31,240 --> 01:38:33,720
Can I come in there, please?

1596
01:38:35,280 --> 01:38:36,720
I can't.

1597
01:38:39,720 --> 01:38:41,160
Not without a token.

1598
01:38:53,640 --> 01:38:55,480
MIDGE: He just put the token in.

1599
01:38:55,560 --> 01:38:57,360
Really? I didn't notice.

1600
01:39:01,320 --> 01:39:02,640
Marry me?

1601
01:39:03,400 --> 01:39:05,040
Yeah.

1602
01:39:05,840 --> 01:39:07,040
I love you.

1603
01:39:08,280 --> 01:39:09,880
I love you back.

1604
01:39:15,840 --> 01:39:18,480
-That's nice.
-I'm so happy.

1605
01:39:33,200 --> 01:39:37,480
LUCY: <i>So I had planned to marry</i>
<i>Peter, but I married Jack instead.</i>

1606
01:39:38,640 --> 01:39:40,520
<i>Thank goodness my father was right.</i>

1607
01:39:40,600 --> 01:39:43,040
<i>Life doesn't always turn out</i>
<i>the way you plan.</i>

1608
01:39:45,200 --> 01:39:48,800
<i>But Jack,</i>
<i>Jack gave me the perfect gift,</i>

1609
01:39:49,400 --> 01:39:51,320
<i>a stamp in my passport.</i>

1610
01:39:51,680 --> 01:39:54,000
<i>He took me to Florence</i>
<i>for our honeymoon.</i>

1611
01:39:54,880 --> 01:39:57,080
<i>I guess you might say</i>
<i>he gave me the world.</i>

1612
01:39:58,760 --> 01:40:02,120
<i>Peter once asked me when</i>
<i>it was that I fell in love with Jack.</i>

1613
01:40:02,320 --> 01:40:03,880
<i>And I told him,</i>

1614
01:40:04,240 --> 01:40:06,680
<i>"It was while you were sleeping."</i>
