1
00:00:58,099 --> 00:01:00,350
Gerald Tate's here. He wants to know
what's happening to his deal.

2
00:01:00,685 --> 00:01:01,810
Go get Harvey.

3
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:04,146
Trust me.
I can handle Gerald Tate.

4
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:13,030
I'm sorry. You say
the bet's to me?

5
00:01:14,115 --> 00:01:16,200
Harvey, when are you going to leave
Pearson and work for a man?

6
00:01:16,826 --> 00:01:18,827
I'll leave Jessica
anytime you want.

7
00:01:18,953 --> 00:01:20,079
You just have to
formally ask.

8
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:21,413
Then, after that,

9
00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:23,791
why don't you formally ask Santa Claus
to bring you a pony

10
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:25,125
Because I'm not
leaving Jessica.

11
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:26,668
I check.

12
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:28,545
Raise. 5,000.

13
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:32,382
I'm all in.

14
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:43,644
You can pay me later.
I've got to go.

15
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,396
Gentlemen.

16
00:01:49,025 --> 00:01:50,359
I'm paying you millions.

17
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:52,194
And you're telling me I'm going
to get screwed?

18
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:54,321
Jessica, have I come
at a bad time?

19
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:58,117
Gerald, this is
Harvey Specter.

20
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:00,994
He's our best closer.

21
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:01,995
Well, if you're
the best closer,

22
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:03,747
where the hell have you been
for the last three hours?

23
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:06,959
Well, Gerald, I specialize
in troubled situations,

24
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:08,043
and when I left
here at 7:00 p.m.

25
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:09,378
this deal
wasn't in jeopardy.

26
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:11,255
So, I'm just trying to figure out what
happened in the interim.

27
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:14,133
We keep offering more money.
They keep rejecting it.

28
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:15,843
It's last-minute
bad faith bullshit.

29
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:20,097
It says here that Cooper won't be
staying on as honorary Vice President.

30
00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:22,099
That's right.
I don't want him around.

31
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:24,393
He wouldn't be around.
It's an honorary position.

32
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:25,561
I don't give a shit.

33
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:29,106
Well, I think you do, because that's
what's changed since I left,

34
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:31,608
which means it's you
who's been dealing in bad faith.

35
00:02:31,734 --> 00:02:35,779
Well, now that you've got a grasp on
what's happened in the goddamn interim,

36
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:37,239
what are you going
to do about it?

37
00:02:37,365 --> 00:02:38,866
Because he's not
getting that title.

38
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:42,161
Well, let me make sure
I understand this, okay?

39
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:44,788
We negotiated a deal
that gave you everything you wanted.

40
00:02:44,914 --> 00:02:46,081
Mr. Cooper signed it.

41
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:47,374
And now,
you won't close

42
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,459
until we take away the last shred
of his dignity?

43
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:50,544
Bingo.

44
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:51,628
Well, that's not
going to happen.

45
00:02:51,754 --> 00:02:52,713
And why the hell not?

46
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:53,964
Because I like Mr. Cooper

47
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:56,592
and my firm doesn't
operate in bad faith.

48
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:58,552
Oh, I see how it is.

49
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:02,097
Instead of working Cooper,
you're working me.

50
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:05,976
Well, why don't you
take your pansy attitude back in there

51
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:07,477
and make him
sign my deal?

52
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:11,023
Or I'll pay someone else
your money to do it for me.

53
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:12,107
First of all, Gerald,

54
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:13,650
if you think anyone is going
to touch this deal

55
00:03:13,776 --> 00:03:16,153
after your bad faith,
you're mistaken.

56
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:20,115
Second, the way
our agreement works

57
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:21,992
is the minute
Cooper signed the deal

58
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:23,368
which gave you
everything you wanted,

59
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:25,204
our fee was
due and payable.

60
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:26,914
Which is why, at 7:30,

61
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,708
I received confirmation
of a wire transfer

62
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:32,711
from escrow indicating
payment in full.

63
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:40,594
So, I'd say
the ball's in your court,

64
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,764
but the truth is,
your balls are in my fist.

65
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,475
Now, I apologize
if that image is too pansy for you,

66
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:48,310
but I'm comfortable enough
with my manhood

67
00:03:48,436 --> 00:03:49,561
to put it out there.

68
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:52,898
Now, get your ass in there
and close the goddamn deal.

69
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:56,276
You let him talk
to me like this?

70
00:03:57,153 --> 00:03:58,946
Harvey speaks
for the firm.

71
00:04:12,293 --> 00:04:15,087
We got paid before Gerald
signed the deal?

72
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:18,507
What are you talking about? This is a
memo about some fire drill on Tuesday.

73
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:20,217
- Ah.
- You're the blue team captain.

74
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:21,843
You get to wear
a fire hat.

75
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:57,254
Time's up.
Pencils down.

76
00:04:59,757 --> 00:05:02,384
Excuse me. Do I know you
from somewhere?

77
00:05:03,344 --> 00:05:05,470
I don't think so.
I have a pretty good memory for faces.

78
00:05:05,596 --> 00:05:07,180
Uh-huh.

79
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:08,849
So do I.

80
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:12,060
Oops. Sorry.

81
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:13,895
I've got it.

82
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:28,410
Hey. Hey! Stop!

83
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:29,536
You in the cap.

84
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:52,726
Hey. Get back here.

85
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:57,022
Come on, man.

86
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,403
What did you get me?

87
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:05,405
What I said I was
going to get you. A 158.

88
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:07,240
I told you
I wanted a 175.

89
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:10,452
And I told you only
one out of 100 people can score that.

90
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:12,913
You're a B-student.
You got a 1,000 on your SATs.

91
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,040
If I get you a 175,
they'll know you cheated.

92
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:18,043
So, only a genius loser
can get a 175?

93
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,254
Actually, no.
I would get a 180.

94
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:23,090
Now, can I have
my money, please?

95
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:31,348
Whoa. This is only half.

96
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:33,475
Then why don't you
go call the police?

97
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:59,876
I've got to get
my shit together.

98
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:02,170
This is the best cheeseburger
I've had in my life.

99
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:04,131
It's from Monday, Trevor.

100
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:08,718
Look, man, I'm serious.
I almost got caught today.

101
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:10,178
I've got to stop
getting stoned.

102
00:07:10,304 --> 00:07:11,638
I've got to get
my act together.

103
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:13,056
Dude, look at me.

104
00:07:13,182 --> 00:07:15,392
You can burn bud
and still be a success.

105
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:17,269
You sell pot
for a living.

106
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:19,104
It still saps
the motivation.

107
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:23,150
All I'm saying is,
you want in, you are in.

108
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:26,194
You know, that is
word for word your offer

109
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:29,322
before I got caught cheating on your
math test in the third grade.

110
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:31,658
- Goddamn memory.
- Stop.

111
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:34,286
Look, no one's going to suspect
you're a dealer.

112
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:35,370
I mean, look at me.

113
00:07:35,496 --> 00:07:37,164
This is
a $2,000 suit, Mike.

114
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,582
I've got, like,
12 of them.

115
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:41,501
I take on real
software projects. I have clients

116
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:45,172
who bring me
briefcases filled with cash,

117
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:48,341
and I hand them identical briefcases
with vacuum-sealed bud.

118
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:51,386
I'm telling you, man.
Hide in plain sight.

119
00:07:51,512 --> 00:07:52,679
What do you
need me for?

120
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:55,891
Well, I have a client coming in
from out of town

121
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:57,267
and I can't meet him,

122
00:07:57,643 --> 00:08:00,353
and I need someone I can trust
to make the drop.

123
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:03,398
It's totally safe.

124
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:05,984
Come on.
Help a brother out.

125
00:08:06,694 --> 00:08:09,529
Trevor, a person is more likely to die
while dealing drugs

126
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:11,740
than they would be
on death row.

127
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:13,700
- In Texas.
- Wait, what are you talking about?

128
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:16,203
It's from Freakonomics.
Do you read anything that I give you?

129
00:08:17,371 --> 00:08:19,998
It doesn't matter, because you have to
find somebody else.

130
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:21,082
I'm not interested.

131
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:23,126
Not interested
in what?

132
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:24,211
What are
you doing here?

133
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:26,379
You said you were going to stay
at your place tonight.

134
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:27,380
"Hi, sweetie.

135
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:30,133
"What a pleasant surprise. I'm so glad
you stopped by."

136
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:31,343
No, we're in the
middle of something.

137
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:32,511
What are you
in the middle of?

138
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:36,515
Trevor's trying
to set me up.

139
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:39,935
That's terrific.
Uh, who's the lucky girl?

140
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:42,354
I'm trying to get him
to work for me.

141
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,355
That's a great idea.

142
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:44,940
It will take some
stress off Trevor,

143
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:47,317
and you'll pick up writing code like you
do everything else.

144
00:08:47,985 --> 00:08:49,444
All right.
I've got to go.

145
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:51,112
I've got to get up early
to see my grandmother

146
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:52,822
and pay them
another month.

147
00:08:55,743 --> 00:08:56,993
- Goodnight.
- Bye.

148
00:09:00,122 --> 00:09:02,415
How did you know Gerald wouldn't
look at that memo?

149
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:05,418
Because a charging
bull always looks at the red cape,

150
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:06,586
not at the man
with the sword.

151
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:08,505
By the way,
I've set up a meeting

152
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:10,966
for you and
John Dockery next week.

153
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:12,467
Dockery? He's Skadden's
biggest client.

154
00:09:12,593 --> 00:09:15,220
Not anymore.
He's looking around.

155
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:18,348
He wants us to assess
where he's vulnerable to a takeover.

156
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:19,432
Plays tennis.

157
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,309
- I want you to close him.
- Consider it done.

158
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:25,355
Then you are officially dismissed
for the evening.

159
00:09:26,148 --> 00:09:27,440
- Cheers.
- Well, you two

160
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:28,733
seem to be
celebrating something.

161
00:09:28,859 --> 00:09:31,236
Mmm-hmm. We are.

162
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:34,239
In fact, you are looking at the best
closer this city has ever seen.

163
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:36,157
Closer, huh? Baseball?

164
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:37,701
Attorney. I close situations.

165
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:40,161
Mmm. So, you only
care about money.

166
00:09:40,454 --> 00:09:42,080
The truth is, I do it
for the children.

167
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,917
I'm Lisa.

168
00:09:46,043 --> 00:09:47,460
Harvey.

169
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:51,339
Lisa, I don't normally do this,
but since we are celebrating,

170
00:09:51,465 --> 00:09:53,341
what time do you
get off tonight?

171
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:55,510
Glad you asked.

172
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:59,389
I get off at ten past
"I'm never going out with you."

173
00:10:02,893 --> 00:10:06,396
I guess, uh, you're not the best closer
this city's ever seen.

174
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:48,980
Morning.

175
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:54,027
Lisa, this was lovely, but I'm afraid
it's time to go.

176
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:55,862
Aw!
Can't we hang out?

177
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:57,405
I can
make you breakfast.

178
00:10:57,531 --> 00:10:58,573
I hate to miss a workout,

179
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:00,867
and I really need
to be in the office by 7:30.

180
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:04,371
Mmm. That's too bad.

181
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:06,373
Because I was kind of
thinking maybe

182
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:09,501
you could eat it
off my stomach.

183
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:13,922
I guess if I skip the gym,
I can still get in by 9:00.

184
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:30,605
I hear someone's
not taking their pills.

185
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:33,692
Because they're trying
to poison me.

186
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:35,819
Grammy, that's crazy.

187
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:39,572
Dr. Shrager gave me her word she
wouldn't poison you until January.

188
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:40,573
If she does it before then,

189
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,367
she can't count it
towards next year's quota.

190
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:47,831
Oh. What did
I teach you?

191
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:55,296
Michael, I'm not going
to be around forever,

192
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:59,008
and I want you to stop
with that stuff.

193
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,387
What stuff?

194
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:06,391
I may be old,
but I'm not an idiot.

195
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:08,601
I know life has
been hard for you,

196
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:10,562
but you're not
a kid anymore.

197
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:11,813
And I want you
to promise

198
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:14,315
you're going to start living up
to your potential.

199
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:21,406
I promise.

200
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:27,412
I'm not saying that I haven't
been charmed by Harvey,

201
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:29,164
but it's just so patronizing
when you say

202
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:30,457
that he can handle
those things

203
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,125
and, "Louis, you can
only handle this."

204
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:34,002
Jessica, I could have
handled Gerald Tate.

205
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:35,420
And I told you
I disagree.

206
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:36,421
- Why?
- Because...

207
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:38,590
Because when you put two bullies in the
same room together,

208
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:40,383
things generally
don't go so well.

209
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:41,968
It's 9:30.
Nice of you to show up

210
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:43,386
two hours after
we open for business.

211
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:45,805
And I see that you're also trying
to look like a pimp.

212
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:48,433
My bad, Louis.
I was out late last night.

213
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:50,518
When I woke up, this is the suit your
wife picked out for me.

214
00:12:50,644 --> 00:12:53,438
And that would be funny if
I had actually been married.

215
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:55,398
- Moving along.
- You're not married?

216
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:58,401
Recruiting. Harvey, your interviews
are set up for tomorrow.

217
00:12:58,527 --> 00:12:59,819
What? Why don't
we just hire

218
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:01,738
the Harvard summer
associate douche?

219
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:04,616
I think if you listen to the phrasing
of that question,

220
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:05,867
you'll come up
with an answer.

221
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:07,577
We need people who think
on their feet,

222
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:09,287
not another clone
with a rod up his ass.

223
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:11,206
Harvey, the fact
that we only hire from Harvard

224
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:13,374
gives us a cachet
that's a little more valuable

225
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:15,084
than hiring a kid
from Rutgers.

226
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:18,588
You went to Harvard Law.

227
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:20,507
I'm an exception.

228
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:22,175
Find me another one.

229
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:24,469
Can we please skip
the recruiting?

230
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:25,845
I work better alone, anyway.

231
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:27,096
Well, I would, Harvey,

232
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:29,432
except all senior partners
get an associate.

233
00:13:29,558 --> 00:13:31,267
It's just a rule.

234
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:33,478
I'm sorry. What?

235
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:36,523
Jessica, I deserve
that promotion.

236
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,107
My billables destroy his.

237
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:40,401
And I'm here night and day
doing whatever's needed

238
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:43,571
instead of swanning in and out of here
whenever I please.

239
00:13:43,697 --> 00:13:46,032
I must admit, he does
make me sound very swan-like.

240
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:48,284
Harvey, shut up.

241
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:52,121
Louis, this is
how it is.

242
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:54,874
All right?
Now, you two make nice.

243
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:58,002
Louis, I apologize.
I was out of line.

244
00:13:58,128 --> 00:14:01,130
Now, if you'll just let me text
your pretend wife

245
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:04,217
that I just made senior partner,
I... What?

246
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:08,096
Too far? Come on.
She doesn't even exist.

247
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:09,180
How was that nice?

248
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:11,224
It's not mean.
Louis. Come on.

249
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,351
Louis. Just messing
around with you.

250
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:16,229
Your grandmother's
getting worse.

251
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:17,689
I need to move
her to full care,

252
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:19,941
or I'll have to transfer her
to a state facility.

253
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:21,734
I won't put her
in a state facility.

254
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:25,029
Then I'm afraid you'll have to
come up with 25,000.

255
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:28,950
Then, I will.

256
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:43,172
Trevor, I'm in.

257
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:46,050
One-time deal. I want 25.
Take it or leave it.

258
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:48,386
I'll take it.
There's a briefcase in my room.

259
00:14:48,512 --> 00:14:51,264
Pick it up tomorrow.
Take it to room 2412,

260
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:52,891
the Chilton Hotel
on Park Avenue.

261
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:54,350
Now, you can't
go to a luxury hotel

262
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:55,518
looking like
a delivery guy.

263
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:57,312
So, shave,
comb your hair,

264
00:14:57,438 --> 00:14:58,396
buy a suit.

265
00:14:58,522 --> 00:15:00,523
- That's a hell of a lot to ask, man.
- Well, I'm not asking you.

266
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:02,483
I'm paying you
$25,000.

267
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:03,943
Okay.

268
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:08,114
Donna. Clear
my schedule tomorrow.

269
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,158
You and I are hiring
a new associate.

270
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:11,242
Done.

271
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:14,037
Tell me. Does this suit
make me look like a pimp?

272
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:17,123
Yeah. A little bit.

273
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:23,171
Yeah. He's in.
I'll take it.

274
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:24,380
Good.

275
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:26,799
I'm going to go
take a piss.

276
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:34,098
Key...

277
00:15:34,224 --> 00:15:37,060
In 24 hours, we'll know if this
new buyer is a cop.

278
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:39,979
Why didn't you tell Trevor he might be
sending his guy into a set-up?

279
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:42,273
Same reason why I don't tell Gina
I'm banging her sister.

280
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,901
It will only
cause trouble.

281
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:46,319
What's up?

282
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:48,029
I... I'm just going
to take off.

283
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:50,907
I don't think you should.

284
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:53,117
Why don't you stay with us
until tomorrow?

285
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:55,036
Now, give me
your cell phone.

286
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:57,705
- Give me your phone.
- Yeah, all right.

287
00:15:57,831 --> 00:16:00,291
And don't even think
about warning your boy.

288
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:02,043
'Cause if these
guys are cops,

289
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:05,171
whoever is holding that weed is going
to jail for a long time.

290
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:17,558
Hey.

291
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:19,143
Hey. God, you scared
the hell out of me.

292
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:20,353
Sorry.

293
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:23,022
Look at you.

294
00:16:24,274 --> 00:16:25,775
- You look great.
- Thanks.

295
00:16:25,901 --> 00:16:27,694
Tell me you decided
to work with Trevor.

296
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:30,405
Uh, trial basis, yeah.

297
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:32,657
Good.

298
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:33,950
What are you
doing here?

299
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:37,036
My mom is coming
by my place later

300
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:38,371
and I don't want
to mess it up,

301
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:39,914
so I'm hanging here.

302
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:41,708
That's not so bad.

303
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:43,001
That's not
the ridiculous part.

304
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:45,712
After I finish scouring
the place for her visit,

305
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:47,880
I sprinkle a tiny bit
of crumbs around.

306
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:52,760
I've got to go.

307
00:16:52,886 --> 00:16:54,637
Hey. Come here.

308
00:16:57,641 --> 00:16:58,683
Mmm.

309
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:02,437
You want to look perfect
on your first day.

310
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:03,646
Yeah.

311
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:10,695
I've got to go.

312
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:13,531
Mmm-hmm.

313
00:17:28,922 --> 00:17:30,840
- Great, thanks.
- Okay.

314
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:34,343
Donna, we're going to need
to streamline this.

315
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,846
Give each guy a hard time before
you send them back.

316
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:39,057
Give me a wink if they say
something clever.

317
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:41,768
- Cool?
- Okay. What are you looking for?

318
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:44,145
Another me.

319
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:47,940
Got it. Arrogant,
self-absorbed, blow-hard.

320
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,734
Thinks he's the smartest
one in the room.

321
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,861
That's why I love you.
You get me.

322
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:54,947
The point is,

323
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:58,409
I can see myself stepping down as
managing partner in 10 years.

324
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:01,162
I will have accomplished
everything that I wanted,

325
00:18:01,288 --> 00:18:04,832
and then still be young enough to start
an entirely new chapter.

326
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:08,669
It seems like it's only been 10 minutes
since I handed the reigns to you.

327
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:09,962
No, it hasn't.

328
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:13,049
And time just moves a lot faster
when you're 160.

329
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,426
Yeah, but how
good do I look?

330
00:18:18,722 --> 00:18:20,306
What's going on
with you?

331
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:21,432
Oh.

332
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,394
Phillip, how did you know
I was your successor?

333
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:26,938
My gut.

334
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:29,774
See, I was afraid you
were going to say that.

335
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:31,776
My gut tells me
it's Harvey.

336
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:33,236
My heart says
he's not ready.

337
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:34,445
What's the problem?

338
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:35,780
He's the problem.

339
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:37,824
If the leader of a firm
doesn't care about

340
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,867
the people
who work for him,

341
00:18:39,993 --> 00:18:41,369
there's not going to be
much of a firm left to lead.

342
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:43,204
So, what are you going
to do about it?

343
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:46,249
What would you do about it?

344
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:50,670
- The man's missing compassion.
- Mmm-hmm.

345
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:52,672
I'd shove it
down his throat.

346
00:18:53,423 --> 00:18:54,423
Smoked salmon?

347
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,789
So, Chip,

348
00:19:27,624 --> 00:19:28,916
what makes you think

349
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:30,877
that I'm going to let
the whitest man that I have ever seen

350
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,503
interview for our firm?

351
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:35,631
Uh, because I have
an appointment.

352
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:37,633
Hmm.

353
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:39,969
Thanks.

354
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:05,036
You can do this.

355
00:20:12,502 --> 00:20:13,502
Why is
the pool closed?

356
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:14,879
I don't know.

357
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:25,056
Kid, what is
wrong with you?

358
00:20:25,182 --> 00:20:26,349
You look like
you're 11 years old.

359
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:28,392
I was late to puberty.

360
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:30,019
Okay.

361
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:35,483
- Thank you.
- Harvey Specter.

362
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:00,716
Very good. Go on.

363
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:04,470
Uh, excuse me. I was thinking about
going for a swim.

364
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:06,013
Are the pool
facilities here nice?

365
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:08,474
Of course, sir.
This is the Chilton Hotel.

366
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:10,101
Best in the city.

367
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:12,937
Why is
the pool closed?

368
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:14,355
And, uh, do you
have the time?

369
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:18,651
It's, uh, 10:00.

370
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:21,070
Thanks.

371
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:25,533
He saw your gun.

372
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:26,534
Oh, you
think that's him?

373
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:35,042
Matches the description. But he didn't
go in the room.

374
00:21:35,168 --> 00:21:36,669
It's 10:00 exactly.
He's just walking by.

375
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:43,050
Go after him.
Stay on the radio.

376
00:22:05,532 --> 00:22:07,074
Rick Sorkin.

377
00:22:07,534 --> 00:22:08,951
Rick Sorkin.

378
00:22:12,372 --> 00:22:13,581
Rick Sorkin?

379
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:16,167
Excuse me,
Mr. Sorkin,

380
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:17,293
you are five minutes late.

381
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:19,128
Is there a reason
why I should let you in?

382
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:23,591
Look, I'm just trying to
ditch the cops, okay?

383
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:25,968
I don't really care
if you let me in or not.

384
00:22:34,394 --> 00:22:36,145
Mr. Specter will
be right with you.

385
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:38,314
What?

386
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:41,859
Can I get you anything?
A coffee or a bottle of water?

387
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:46,781
Hi. Uh, Rick Sorkin.

388
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:48,199
Harvey Specter.
Nice to meet you.

389
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:50,576
Why don't you
have a seat here?

390
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:52,912
Whoa. What's this?

391
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:01,212
Can I help you?

392
00:23:03,006 --> 00:23:04,048
No.

393
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:12,264
Excuse me. Mr. Tate.

394
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:14,392
- Who are you?
- My name is Louis Litt.

395
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:15,476
I work for
Pearson Hardman.

396
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:19,021
I have some information that I think
will lead you to the conclusion

397
00:23:19,147 --> 00:23:20,272
that you're better
served at Pearson

398
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:22,233
with me as
your lead counsel.

399
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,360
I'm listening.

400
00:23:27,447 --> 00:23:29,740
How the hell
did you know they were the police?

401
00:23:30,158 --> 00:23:32,159
I read this novel
in elementary school,

402
00:23:32,452 --> 00:23:34,870
um, cops were
staking out a hotel.

403
00:23:34,996 --> 00:23:36,330
One of them dresses
as a bellhop.

404
00:23:36,456 --> 00:23:37,790
The other is
a man in a suit.

405
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:39,417
And it was the exact
same thing.

406
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:42,253
You read a novel
in elementary school.

407
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:43,921
What? I like to read.

408
00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:46,590
And why did you ask them
what time it was?

409
00:23:46,716 --> 00:23:47,800
Uh, throw them off.

410
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:49,301
I mean, what kind
of drug dealer

411
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:50,803
asks a cop
what time it is

412
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:52,805
when he's got a briefcase full
of pot, right?

413
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:55,057
We should hire you.

414
00:23:55,183 --> 00:23:58,060
Jesus, I'd give you the 25 grand
as a signing bonus.

415
00:23:58,603 --> 00:23:59,603
I'll take it.

416
00:24:00,647 --> 00:24:02,982
Unfortunately, we only
hire from Harvard.

417
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:06,277
And you not only did not go to
Harvard Law School,

418
00:24:07,028 --> 00:24:08,654
you haven't even
gone to any law school.

419
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:11,031
What if I told you that
I consume knowledge

420
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:12,116
like no one
you've ever met

421
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:14,076
and I've actually
passed the bar?

422
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:15,828
I'd say you're
full of crap.

423
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:20,749
That's a BarBri Legal Handbook
right there, right?

424
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:22,126
Open it up.
Read me something.

425
00:24:22,502 --> 00:24:23,836
Anything.

426
00:24:28,758 --> 00:24:30,843
"Civil liability associated with agency

427
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:32,845
is based on several factors,
including..."

428
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:35,306
Including the deviation
of the agent from his path,

429
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:37,975
the reasonable inference
of agency on behalf of the plaintiff,

430
00:24:38,101 --> 00:24:40,811
and the nature
of the damages themselves.

431
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:43,314
How did you know that?

432
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,775
I learned it
when I studied for the bar.

433
00:24:48,945 --> 00:24:52,656
Okay, hotshot.
Fire up this laptop.

434
00:24:54,284 --> 00:24:58,287
I'm gonna show you
what a Harvard attorney can do.

435
00:24:58,955 --> 00:25:00,289
Pick a topic.

436
00:25:01,541 --> 00:25:03,000
Stock option backdating.

437
00:25:03,126 --> 00:25:05,085
Although backdating
options is legal,

438
00:25:05,212 --> 00:25:10,883
violations arise related
to disclosures under IRC, Section 409A.

439
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:13,177
You forgot about
Sarbanes-Oxley.

440
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:17,598
The statute of limitations
renders Sarbanes-Oxley moot post-2007.

441
00:25:17,724 --> 00:25:20,559
Well, not if you can
find actions to cover up the violation,

442
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:23,562
as established in
the Sixth Circuit, May 2008.

443
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:27,900
That's impressive,
but you're sitting at a computer.

444
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:32,571
Playing Hearts. Sorry.

445
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:33,822
If you want to beat me,
you're going to have to

446
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:35,199
do it at
something else.

447
00:25:35,992 --> 00:25:37,076
How can you
know all that?

448
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:39,119
I told you.
I like to read.

449
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:41,330
And once I read something,
I understand it.

450
00:25:41,456 --> 00:25:44,917
And once I understand it,
I never forget it.

451
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:46,752
Why take the bar?

452
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:51,590
This dickhead bet me I couldn't pass it
without going to law school.

453
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:58,681
Okay, look. This is all pretty
fascinating stuff,

454
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:01,058
but I'm afraid
I've got to get back to work.

455
00:26:01,685 --> 00:26:05,187
I'll make sure that
Serpico isn't around waiting for you.

456
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:21,495
If you want this job
so much,

457
00:26:21,621 --> 00:26:22,955
why didn't you just
go to law school?

458
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:26,875
When I was in college, it was my dream
to be a lawyer.

459
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:28,919
I needed some money

460
00:26:29,045 --> 00:26:33,882
and Trevor convinced me
to memorize this math test and sell it.

461
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,971
Turns out we sold it
to the dean's daughter.

462
00:26:39,222 --> 00:26:40,347
I lost my scholarship,

463
00:26:40,473 --> 00:26:42,725
I got kicked
out of school, I...

464
00:26:45,645 --> 00:26:48,063
I got knocked into a different life.

465
00:26:49,649 --> 00:26:52,860
And I have been
wishing for a way back ever since.

466
00:26:56,865 --> 00:26:58,490
Let me tell you something.

467
00:26:58,617 --> 00:26:59,908
This isn't
elementary school.

468
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:03,495
This is hard work. Long hours.
High pressure.

469
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:05,497
I need a grown
goddamn man.

470
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:07,958
You give me this,

471
00:27:08,084 --> 00:27:09,543
and I will work as hard
as it takes

472
00:27:09,669 --> 00:27:10,919
to school those
Harvard douches

473
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:12,963
and become the best lawyer
you have ever seen.

474
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:15,424
I'm inclined to
give you a shot

475
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:17,009
but what if I decide
to go another way?

476
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:19,053
I'd say that's fair.

477
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:22,222
Sometimes, I like to hang out with
people who aren't that bright.

478
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:23,891
You know, just to see how
the other half lives.

479
00:27:24,934 --> 00:27:26,518
Move over.

480
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:29,021
I'm emailing the firm we've just found
our next associate.

481
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:36,862
All right. You're going to start
a week from Monday.

482
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:39,740
Here's what you're going to do.
First, no more pot.

483
00:27:39,866 --> 00:27:40,741
We drug test.

484
00:27:40,867 --> 00:27:41,992
Stop smoking now,
you'll be fine.

485
00:27:42,118 --> 00:27:43,577
I assume that's
all the drugs you do.

486
00:27:43,703 --> 00:27:44,662
How did
you know that?

487
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:45,788
You read books,
I read people.

488
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:47,956
And pot-heads smoke pot.
That's what they do.

489
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:49,625
That's not all I do.
I have interests.

490
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:50,793
You're
Albert "frigging" Einstein

491
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:52,294
and you couldn't manage
to get into law school?

492
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:53,671
You think that's not
from smoking weed?

493
00:27:53,797 --> 00:27:54,797
- Trevor got...
- That's another thing.

494
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:56,799
You're never going to talk to
Trevor again.

495
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:58,092
You're going to
ditch that briefcase

496
00:27:58,218 --> 00:27:59,760
and you're going to get on a
plane to Harvard

497
00:27:59,886 --> 00:28:01,178
and you're going to learn
everything there is

498
00:28:01,304 --> 00:28:02,805
about going
to law school there.

499
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:04,014
- Did you buy that suit?
- Yeah.

500
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:05,974
Let's buy
some new ones.

501
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:23,784
Hi. Uh, how do I sign up
for today's law school tour?

502
00:28:24,911 --> 00:28:27,621
You go back in time six weeks, because
that's when it booked up.

503
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:29,832
Um...

504
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:31,709
This is Harvard Law.

505
00:28:31,835 --> 00:28:33,961
We get over 7,000
applications a year.

506
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:36,088
You think you can just
walk in and take a tour?

507
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:40,217
Thank you.

508
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:42,845
Uh, Eduardo Fernandez,

509
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:46,598
who first of all looks like he works at
the public pool or something,

510
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:47,975
and he comes up to me
the other day

511
00:28:48,101 --> 00:28:49,810
and I completely know
he's a freshman.

512
00:28:49,936 --> 00:28:52,438
He looks at me and he goes, "Where is
the Public Health School"?

513
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:53,522
Which is right
around the corner.

514
00:28:53,648 --> 00:28:55,315
- You know what I tell him?
- Clifford Watkins?

515
00:28:55,442 --> 00:28:57,901
Excuse me.
Can I help you?

516
00:28:58,027 --> 00:29:01,321
Jonathan Atwater. I work for Dean Wormer
in the admissions office?

517
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:02,614
Yes, of course.

518
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:03,699
What can I do for you?

519
00:29:03,825 --> 00:29:05,325
The Dean personally
sent me down here

520
00:29:05,452 --> 00:29:07,536
to invite you to a small
cocktail hour

521
00:29:07,662 --> 00:29:11,749
for some of our, uh,
more realistic candidates.

522
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:13,876
And we'd like to keep this sort
of thing discreet,

523
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:16,336
so if you'd subtly
hand me your name tag,

524
00:29:16,463 --> 00:29:19,757
you can proceed directly
to the Dean's office.

525
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:21,842
Congratulations.

526
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:28,599
Harvard Law is
the oldest law school in the country

527
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:32,102
and boasts the most
successful graduates in the world.

528
00:29:32,228 --> 00:29:35,189
Currently, we are six of nine
Supreme Court justices,

529
00:29:35,315 --> 00:29:38,150
and, of course, the President of
the United States.

530
00:30:43,132 --> 00:30:45,175
Uh, hi. Good morning.
I'm here...

531
00:30:45,301 --> 00:30:46,260
Have a seat.

532
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:53,809
Thank you.

533
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:14,663
Mike Ross?

534
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:16,707
Hi. I'm Rachel Zane.

535
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:18,125
I'll be giving you
your orientation.

536
00:31:18,626 --> 00:31:19,918
Wow, you're pretty.

537
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:21,253
Good. You've hit on me.

538
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:23,463
We can get it out of the way
that I am not interested.

539
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:24,965
No. I'm sorry.
I wasn't hitting on you.

540
00:31:25,091 --> 00:31:26,925
Trust me. I've given
dozens of these,

541
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:28,677
and, without fail, whatever new
hotshot it is

542
00:31:28,803 --> 00:31:30,554
thinks that because
I'm just a paralegal

543
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:34,016
that I will somehow be blown away by
his dazzling degree.

544
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:35,976
Let me assure you.
I won't.

545
00:31:37,186 --> 00:31:38,729
- I was.
- Mmm-hmm.

546
00:31:38,855 --> 00:31:40,022
I was hitting on you.

547
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:41,023
You were.

548
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:42,983
Take notes. I'm not going
to repeat myself.

549
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:45,777
I love you.

550
00:31:46,321 --> 00:31:49,948
Each bank of offices specializes in its
own arena of the law,

551
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:52,159
and is anchored by a department head
on either end.

552
00:31:52,285 --> 00:31:54,161
So, on our left,
Mergers and Acquisitions.

553
00:31:54,287 --> 00:31:56,663
On the opposite side,
high net worth Divorce.

554
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:59,583
Nice.
Mergers across from Divorce.

555
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:01,084
Symmetry.

556
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,962
Uh, yeah.
I should just listen.

557
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:06,840
The firm operates on a chain of
command model.

558
00:32:06,966 --> 00:32:08,550
Harvey's your
commanding officer.

559
00:32:08,676 --> 00:32:10,510
However, Louis Litt, he oversees
all associates,

560
00:32:10,637 --> 00:32:11,929
so you'll also
answer to him.

561
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:14,056
What do you think
about Harvey?

562
00:32:14,724 --> 00:32:15,891
People are
in awe of him.

563
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:17,476
They say he's the best
closer there is.

564
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:19,978
But I have very little
contact with him, so I don't know.

565
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:22,147
What about Louis Litt?

566
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:25,150
Let's continue
with your tour.

567
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:29,780
Hey, Becky.
You are glowing.

568
00:32:29,906 --> 00:32:31,239
I wonder why that is.
Oh, yeah.

569
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:34,034
It's the day they announce
my promotion.

570
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,827
Jimmy, have you
lost weight?

571
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:37,329
- Steve-o!
- Hey, Harvey.

572
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:40,248
Looking like a guy
who came to work.

573
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:43,377
Excuse me. Why are you scratching off
the "Senior" off my door?

574
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:45,379
I got a work order
to take it off.

575
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:46,546
Who issued
the work order?

576
00:32:46,673 --> 00:32:47,798
My supervisor.

577
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:49,591
Why did he issue
the work order?

578
00:32:49,717 --> 00:32:52,177
If I knew that,
I'd be his supervisor.

579
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:53,762
You seem to be
enjoying yourself.

580
00:32:53,888 --> 00:32:57,015
I haven't enjoyed
myself since 2004.

581
00:32:57,141 --> 00:32:58,058
Donna?

582
00:32:58,476 --> 00:33:01,061
Someone's trying to have a little fun
with me here.

583
00:33:01,187 --> 00:33:03,355
Jessica wants to see you
in her office.

584
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:04,523
Now.

585
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:09,319
And finally, this is where
you'll live.

586
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:12,906
Wow.

587
00:33:13,032 --> 00:33:14,992
I gave you that for a reason.
You haven't taken one note.

588
00:33:15,118 --> 00:33:16,702
- That's because...
- Because you were too busy

589
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:19,204
ogling me to listen
to a word I've said?

590
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:23,875
Partner's offices
anchor the wings.

591
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:26,211
Fifth floor is research.
Sixth is security.

592
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:29,339
All work gets billed,
even if it's finding an address.

593
00:33:29,465 --> 00:33:31,216
I answer to Harvey
and Louis Litt,

594
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:33,927
and judging by the way you responded
to my questions,

595
00:33:34,053 --> 00:33:36,430
I should admire Harvey
and I should fear Louis.

596
00:33:36,889 --> 00:33:38,098
You have been here
for five years

597
00:33:38,224 --> 00:33:39,766
and just because
I outrank you

598
00:33:39,892 --> 00:33:41,101
does not mean
I have the authority

599
00:33:41,227 --> 00:33:42,185
to command
your services.

600
00:33:42,311 --> 00:33:43,937
Oh. It's also pretty clear

601
00:33:44,063 --> 00:33:46,148
that you think you're too smart
to be a paralegal.

602
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:48,608
You know what
nobody likes?

603
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:50,360
Nobody likes
a show-off.

604
00:33:50,486 --> 00:33:53,113
You used the word
"ogling." I mean...

605
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:55,991
When do I get
to see Harvey?

606
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:01,538
Gerald Tate
fired the firm.

607
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:03,665
So you're taking
my promotion away.

608
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:06,626
You know, most firms would put you
in front of the bar

609
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:07,919
and have your
license stripped.

610
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:10,005
You lied to a client
and he figured it out.

611
00:34:10,339 --> 00:34:12,340
I lied to him to get him to do
the right thing

612
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:13,967
and honor his
goddamn contract.

613
00:34:14,093 --> 00:34:15,385
And you didn't
seem to mind so much

614
00:34:15,511 --> 00:34:16,928
when you thought
I got away with it.

615
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:18,680
But you didn't
get away with it.

616
00:34:18,806 --> 00:34:20,849
And I can't justify handing you
a promotion

617
00:34:20,975 --> 00:34:22,684
on the same day that you lose
a huge client.

618
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:24,895
One client doesn't
make a firm.

619
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:26,730
I don't know
if you've noticed,

620
00:34:26,856 --> 00:34:28,899
but we're in the middle
of an economic meltdown.

621
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:30,484
Companies aren't
exactly lining up

622
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:33,153
to spend money on attorneys
right now.

623
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:35,614
And you know,
Gerald might have forgiven the lying

624
00:34:36,365 --> 00:34:37,741
had you not
humiliated him.

625
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:40,368
But you did and you need
to accept that.

626
00:34:43,706 --> 00:34:46,625
Jessica, if you hadn't
done as much for me as you have,

627
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:48,085
I'd be heading
for the door.

628
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:50,962
If I hadn't done
as much for you as I have,

629
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:52,881
I'd be throwing you
out the window.

630
00:34:54,634 --> 00:34:57,010
But, Harvey,
no more shenanigans.

631
00:34:57,136 --> 00:34:59,888
You do one more thing
that isn't straight as an arrow,

632
00:35:00,014 --> 00:35:02,349
and instead of
covering your ass,

633
00:35:02,475 --> 00:35:04,101
I will put you in front of
the bar myself.

634
00:35:11,192 --> 00:35:13,068
- Mike.
- Hey.

635
00:35:13,194 --> 00:35:14,778
Who's ready for
a great first day?

636
00:35:14,904 --> 00:35:16,196
I'm going to have
to let you go.

637
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:17,405
What?

638
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:19,366
I just got reamed
for lying to a client

639
00:35:19,492 --> 00:35:21,451
and if they find out
that I lied about you going to Harvard,

640
00:35:21,577 --> 00:35:22,994
they'll take away
my license.

641
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:23,995
You what?

642
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:25,664
Not now, Donna.

643
00:35:25,998 --> 00:35:28,708
Look, I have to put my own interests
above yours.

644
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:30,168
It's nothing personal.

645
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:31,378
You're fired.

646
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:34,965
Wait. So you're
worried that if I stay,

647
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:37,134
then they
might find out

648
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:40,554
that you lied about me and you'll lose
your license.

649
00:35:40,847 --> 00:35:42,055
But if you fire me,

650
00:35:42,181 --> 00:35:44,182
then I could tell them that you
lied about me

651
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:46,101
and you'd definitely
lose your license.

652
00:35:48,062 --> 00:35:50,188
Are you telling me
that if I throw you under the bus,

653
00:35:50,314 --> 00:35:51,606
you're going to
drag me with you?

654
00:35:51,732 --> 00:35:53,817
But you put your
interests above mine.

655
00:35:53,943 --> 00:35:57,404
I mean, I'm just
putting mine back up next to yours.

656
00:35:59,615 --> 00:36:00,699
You're rehired.

657
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:05,287
Okay. So, should I...
All right.

658
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:06,621
Here's what's going
to happen.

659
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:08,748
You're going to give
me back my promotion,

660
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:10,333
and that's the last we're going to
talk about this.

661
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,627
- And why is that?
- Because if you don't,

662
00:36:12,753 --> 00:36:15,255
I'm going to go across town
and join Rick Peterson.

663
00:36:15,381 --> 00:36:17,674
I'm going to approach every client
I've ever closed,

664
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,467
and I'm going to
take them with me.

665
00:36:20,136 --> 00:36:21,386
You do that
and you'll force me

666
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:22,888
to put you in front
of the ethics board.

667
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:24,472
- I don't think you will.
- And why not?

668
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:26,474
Because you were
obligated to notify them

669
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:28,476
the second
I lied to Gerald, but you didn't.

670
00:36:28,769 --> 00:36:30,145
You put me in front of the
board right now,

671
00:36:30,271 --> 00:36:31,646
I'll put you
right up there with me.

672
00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:33,690
Hmm.

673
00:36:39,113 --> 00:36:41,907
I'll... I'll give you
your promotion.

674
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:44,284
But you have to
do something for me.

675
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:45,702
Anything.

676
00:36:46,078 --> 00:36:47,120
Ah.

677
00:36:47,246 --> 00:36:48,914
- Pro bono.
- Anything but that.

678
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,416
Harvey, pro bono cases
are how we as a firm

679
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:54,044
show that we care about more than
just ourselves.

680
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:56,129
I'm not saying
we shouldn't do them.

681
00:36:56,255 --> 00:36:57,380
I'm saying
I shouldn't do them.

682
00:36:57,506 --> 00:36:59,257
And it's how
you can show me

683
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:02,052
that you care about more than
just yourself.

684
00:37:03,262 --> 00:37:05,639
You'll handle this yourself.
You will not pass it off.

685
00:37:06,265 --> 00:37:07,766
Absolutely.

686
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:12,520
Your first case.

687
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:14,022
Awesome. What is it?

688
00:37:14,148 --> 00:37:16,149
Pro bono.
Sexual harassment.

689
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:19,236
Don't tell anyone I laid it off on you
and don't screw it up.

690
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:21,613
Got it. You can't
handle it.

691
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:23,531
I'll knock it
out of the park.

692
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:25,408
Easy, Clarence Thomas.
Just go meet the client.

693
00:37:25,868 --> 00:37:28,662
Hey. Didn't I tell you
to get some better suits?

694
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:30,789
I spent $500.

695
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:32,999
For how many suits?

696
00:37:33,125 --> 00:37:34,209
Five.

697
00:37:35,211 --> 00:37:36,211
What?

698
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:45,136
Nancy?

699
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:47,138
Mike?

700
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:48,556
Yeah, hi.

701
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:51,559
You're a kid.

702
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:53,645
No. I'm a...
I'm a grown man.

703
00:37:54,021 --> 00:37:55,272
You're so skinny.

704
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,190
Do they feed you?

705
00:37:58,317 --> 00:37:59,192
Here, have a grape.

706
00:37:59,318 --> 00:38:00,610
Thank you.

707
00:38:01,821 --> 00:38:03,697
Why don't you
tell me your story?

708
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,116
It started
two years ago.

709
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:09,160
I was a stay-at-home mom
to my son, Freddie.

710
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:12,414
And one day, we were at Little League,
Freddie was five.

711
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,207
He really hated that he couldn't play
with the older kids.

712
00:38:15,001 --> 00:38:17,335
It was the third inning,
and I got a phone call.

713
00:38:17,586 --> 00:38:21,548
My husband had been in a car accident
and he was gone.

714
00:38:21,882 --> 00:38:23,591
Just like that.

715
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:25,844
I... I'm so sorry.

716
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:27,887
I did the best I could.

717
00:38:28,014 --> 00:38:31,308
I got myself a job as a secretary
at Devlin McGreggor

718
00:38:31,434 --> 00:38:35,562
and I even got promoted to secretary of
the President, Charles Hunt.

719
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:38,690
And that's when
it all changed.

720
00:38:39,692 --> 00:38:41,359
It's okay. Tell me
what happened.

721
00:38:41,902 --> 00:38:44,070
He started asking me
to stay late,

722
00:38:44,196 --> 00:38:46,948
order in dinner, see,
other stuff like that.

723
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:50,076
One night, he says that if
I sleep with him,

724
00:38:50,202 --> 00:38:51,911
he's going to take care of me
in the firm.

725
00:38:52,038 --> 00:38:54,122
And if I don't,
he's going to fire me.

726
00:38:54,248 --> 00:38:55,540
So, what did you do?

727
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:57,625
I went to
human resources.

728
00:38:57,752 --> 00:38:58,960
They said they investigated.

729
00:38:59,086 --> 00:39:01,087
Couldn't find anything
to support my claim.

730
00:39:01,547 --> 00:39:04,716
Two months later, I was fired for
poor job performance.

731
00:39:04,967 --> 00:39:06,426
They wouldn't let me
say goodbye to anybody.

732
00:39:06,552 --> 00:39:08,887
They wouldn't write me a letter
of recommendation.

733
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:10,638
I wasn't looking
for a payoff.

734
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:13,099
All I wanted was
for it to stop.

735
00:39:14,393 --> 00:39:16,269
Can you help me?

736
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:20,398
Uh, yes. Yes, I can.

737
00:39:26,155 --> 00:39:27,030
What do you need
my help for?

738
00:39:27,156 --> 00:39:29,532
- Wait. Can I just...
- No. Give me an update.

739
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:31,993
Uh, you know,
she's a nice woman.

740
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:33,453
- She, uh...
- On the case.

741
00:39:33,996 --> 00:39:35,955
I don't get emotionally attached
to the clients.

742
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:39,250
This woman had her life ripped apart.
You don't even care?

743
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:41,252
I'm not about caring.
I'm about winning.

744
00:39:41,837 --> 00:39:43,254
Why can't you
be about both?

745
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:46,883
I'd explain it to you but then I'd have
to care about you.

746
00:39:47,009 --> 00:39:48,301
Right.

747
00:39:49,637 --> 00:39:51,137
What are you doing?
Don't touch that.

748
00:39:51,263 --> 00:39:52,889
I'm just checking
my lock.

749
00:39:53,015 --> 00:39:54,933
You ride your bike to...

750
00:39:56,185 --> 00:39:58,228
It's locked, okay?
Come on.

751
00:40:00,481 --> 00:40:01,606
Taxi!

752
00:40:03,943 --> 00:40:06,486
Defense sent over
the investigation files as a courtesy.

753
00:40:06,612 --> 00:40:08,905
No, they didn't. Nobody does anything
as a courtesy.

754
00:40:09,031 --> 00:40:10,115
They sent those files

755
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:11,783
because that's where they want
you to look.

756
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:14,327
Listen, being a lawyer
is like being a doctor.

757
00:40:14,453 --> 00:40:16,121
You mean how you don't get emotional
about the client?

758
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:18,456
No. I mean, you keep pressing
until it hurts,

759
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:19,791
then you know
where to look.

760
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:21,501
Forget about impeaching
the investigation.

761
00:40:21,627 --> 00:40:23,503
It won't lead anywhere. No employee
is going to testify

762
00:40:23,629 --> 00:40:24,712
against their own CEO.

763
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:26,840
Okay. So, what do
you suggest I do?

764
00:40:26,966 --> 00:40:29,509
Think. If this guy's
done this once...

765
00:40:29,635 --> 00:40:30,635
He's done it before.

766
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:33,638
And if the people who work for him now
won't testify against him...

767
00:40:33,764 --> 00:40:36,266
Someone who used to
work for him might.

768
00:40:36,809 --> 00:40:37,767
You know what?

769
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:40,228
I'd subpoena the personnel records
of every woman

770
00:40:40,354 --> 00:40:42,105
who's left the firm
during this guy's tenure.

771
00:40:42,231 --> 00:40:44,107
That's funny. That's exactly
what I thought.

772
00:40:44,233 --> 00:40:46,317
Then what do you
need my help for?

773
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:48,278
I don't know how to fill out
a subpoena.

774
00:40:52,741 --> 00:40:55,618
By the way, did you get her to sign
the engagement letter?

775
00:40:55,744 --> 00:40:56,703
Yeah.

776
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:58,830
What's an
engagement letter?

777
00:40:58,956 --> 00:41:01,749
It's a piece of paper that keeps her
from being able to sue us.

778
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:02,834
Oh.

779
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,962
Uh, hey. Donna, can you show me how to
fill out a subpoena?

780
00:41:06,088 --> 00:41:07,797
Absolutely. And after that,
you want me to show you

781
00:41:07,923 --> 00:41:08,965
how to wipe your ass?

782
00:41:09,091 --> 00:41:10,049
It's funny, because you
should already know

783
00:41:10,176 --> 00:41:11,426
how to do
both those things.

784
00:41:11,552 --> 00:41:12,927
Ah, yeah.
That's hilarious.

785
00:41:13,053 --> 00:41:14,596
What's that?

786
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:16,764
That's my suit guy.
Go in, tell him I sent you,

787
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:17,849
and spend some money.

788
00:41:17,975 --> 00:41:20,018
What does it matter how much money
I spend on suits?

789
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:21,769
People respond to
how we're dressed.

790
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:23,563
So, like it or not, this is what
you have to do.

791
00:41:23,689 --> 00:41:25,482
Oh, that's weird.
You're giving me advice?

792
00:41:25,608 --> 00:41:27,692
It sounds like you actually
care about me.

793
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:29,611
I don't.
You're a reflection of me,

794
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:31,488
and I absolutely
care about me.

795
00:41:31,614 --> 00:41:34,782
So get your skinny tie out of my face
and get to work.

796
00:41:36,785 --> 00:41:38,161
That was a little harsh.

797
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:40,872
- Really?
- Yeah.

798
00:41:49,089 --> 00:41:52,175
Mike. Where are you going?

799
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:55,345
It's 6:30.
I'm going home.

800
00:41:56,931 --> 00:41:58,681
Okay. What's so funny?

801
00:41:58,807 --> 00:42:00,433
You're a rookie associate.

802
00:42:00,559 --> 00:42:02,352
If you go home before 9:00
on your first week,

803
00:42:02,478 --> 00:42:04,103
you're not going to make it through
your first month.

804
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:06,231
- Oh.
- And Louis Litt wants to see you.

805
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:07,607
- Hey. Can I ask you something?
- Mmm-hmm.

806
00:42:07,733 --> 00:42:09,734
This tie,
is it too skinny?

807
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:12,070
Yeah.

808
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:13,571
All right.

809
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:26,501
I know
you had orientation from Rachel,

810
00:42:26,627 --> 00:42:30,421
but I wanted to give
you a special welcome from me.

811
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:32,549
Um, amongst other things,

812
00:42:32,675 --> 00:42:35,885
I'm sort
of the disciplinarian of the associates.

813
00:42:39,598 --> 00:42:40,598
You wanted
to see me?

814
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:41,724
Yes. Gary, please come in.

815
00:42:42,101 --> 00:42:43,434
Mike, this is Gary Lipsky.

816
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:45,520
Gary's one of our most
promising associates from last year.

817
00:42:45,646 --> 00:42:46,646
Hi.

818
00:42:48,065 --> 00:42:49,691
Gary, Ms. Pearson
wanted me to ask,

819
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:51,401
have you completed
the Petramco filing?

820
00:42:51,777 --> 00:42:53,319
Uh, well, my brother
was in over the weekend,

821
00:42:53,445 --> 00:42:54,529
so I didn't
really get to it.

822
00:42:55,281 --> 00:42:57,699
Gary, come on. This is,
like, the third time I've had to ask.

823
00:42:57,825 --> 00:42:58,700
I'll get right on it.

824
00:42:59,076 --> 00:43:00,493
Don't bother.
You're fired.

825
00:43:00,619 --> 00:43:02,453
What? You...
You can't fire me.

826
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:04,706
Oh, yes, I can.
And I just did.

827
00:43:04,832 --> 00:43:06,666
Go pack up
your things.

828
00:43:06,792 --> 00:43:09,252
Don't you ever show your face
in this place again.

829
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,595
See, I arranged
for you to see that

830
00:43:18,721 --> 00:43:21,389
because we pay
our associates very well

831
00:43:21,515 --> 00:43:23,891
and we provide the opportunity for
unlimited advancement.

832
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:27,145
But in return,
we expect results.

833
00:43:30,524 --> 00:43:31,983
Have I made myself clear?

834
00:43:33,235 --> 00:43:34,360
Yeah.

835
00:43:36,822 --> 00:43:38,031
Great.

836
00:43:38,532 --> 00:43:40,366
Welcome to
Pearson Hardman.

837
00:43:45,956 --> 00:43:48,124
Feel free to
go back to work.

838
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:52,879
Harvey.

839
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:56,674
Okay, I have
two words for you.

840
00:43:56,925 --> 00:43:58,676
Absolutely beautiful.

841
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:01,638
You think you're the only one who can
charm a client?

842
00:44:02,222 --> 00:44:04,307
Categorically stunning.

843
00:44:05,184 --> 00:44:06,559
How's the new kid
working out?

844
00:44:06,685 --> 00:44:07,894
Really hot.

845
00:44:08,812 --> 00:44:09,854
You're an idiot.

846
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:11,439
Jessica Pearson.

847
00:44:11,565 --> 00:44:13,191
Good night, Harvey.

848
00:44:14,526 --> 00:44:15,735
Goodnight.

849
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:19,238
Sunday's big game finds Washington

850
00:44:19,365 --> 00:44:21,115
traveling to Philadelphia.

851
00:44:23,202 --> 00:44:24,577
What are you
doing here?

852
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:26,537
Watching SportsCenter.

853
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:27,664
Boo-yah!

854
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:30,750
You won't return
my phone calls.

855
00:44:30,876 --> 00:44:32,877
Uh, yeah, because
you set me up.

856
00:44:33,003 --> 00:44:34,796
- You remember that?
- You think I knew about that?

857
00:44:34,922 --> 00:44:36,172
Here we go.

858
00:44:36,298 --> 00:44:39,717
Round 50 of "I get the shaft because you
didn't know the whole story."

859
00:44:39,843 --> 00:44:43,346
You knew there were risks when you
quoted that crap from that book. Okay?

860
00:44:43,472 --> 00:44:47,058
You needed money, and I came through
with an opportunity like always.

861
00:44:47,184 --> 00:44:48,935
Besides, you weren't the only
one who got screwed.

862
00:44:49,311 --> 00:44:50,353
They pulled
a gun on me.

863
00:44:50,479 --> 00:44:52,355
Oh, really?
And why did they do that?

864
00:44:52,773 --> 00:44:54,107
To keep me from
warning you.

865
00:44:54,483 --> 00:44:55,608
So, you did know.

866
00:44:55,734 --> 00:44:57,235
Well, not until after
it was too late.

867
00:44:57,361 --> 00:44:58,778
Well, it's too late now.

868
00:44:59,279 --> 00:45:01,030
Look, let me
make it up to you.

869
00:45:01,156 --> 00:45:02,990
Oh, you want to
make it up to me?

870
00:45:03,117 --> 00:45:04,784
Give me my key back.

871
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:16,003
Michael. Come on.

872
00:45:17,172 --> 00:45:20,508
You know I don't want to live in a world
where we're not tight.

873
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:23,636
Then kill yourself.

874
00:45:24,388 --> 00:45:25,430
Get out.

875
00:45:27,307 --> 00:45:28,850
Get the hell out.

876
00:45:54,501 --> 00:45:57,670
Donna, I need the... Oh, also, I didn't
have a chance to...

877
00:45:58,338 --> 00:45:59,714
- Marry me?
- I took care of that, too.

878
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:01,257
We've been married
for the last seven years.

879
00:46:01,383 --> 00:46:02,592
Excellent.

880
00:46:03,635 --> 00:46:06,220
Um, Devlin McGreggor is fighting
the subpoena.

881
00:46:06,346 --> 00:46:07,972
They filed a motion
to dismiss the case

882
00:46:08,098 --> 00:46:09,807
- based on our lack of evidence.
- Good.

883
00:46:09,933 --> 00:46:12,685
Good... Wait. What do you
mean "good"?

884
00:46:12,811 --> 00:46:13,978
They don't want to hand over
the files.

885
00:46:14,104 --> 00:46:15,062
You pressed
where it hurt.

886
00:46:15,189 --> 00:46:16,230
You're looking
in the right place.

887
00:46:16,356 --> 00:46:17,482
Did you think they
wouldn't fight back?

888
00:46:17,608 --> 00:46:19,734
Well, I...
Now that you mention it.

889
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:21,277
Oh. My bad.

890
00:46:21,403 --> 00:46:23,362
I keep forgetting
you don't actually know anything.

891
00:46:24,907 --> 00:46:27,450
The idea is you make a move,
they make a move.

892
00:46:27,576 --> 00:46:29,160
You go back and forth
until one of you wins.

893
00:46:29,286 --> 00:46:30,703
Okay. What if they
win the motion

894
00:46:30,829 --> 00:46:32,705
and the case
gets dismissed?

895
00:46:32,831 --> 00:46:35,124
Then you're not as good
as you think you are.

896
00:46:37,002 --> 00:46:39,086
Harvey! What a coincidence.

897
00:46:39,213 --> 00:46:40,463
I was wondering
how the pro bono was coming.

898
00:46:40,589 --> 00:46:42,590
- I'm all over it.
- That makes me very happy.

899
00:46:42,716 --> 00:46:44,008
Because if I were to find out
that you weren't

900
00:46:44,134 --> 00:46:45,551
putting in your
full effort,

901
00:46:45,677 --> 00:46:47,512
- I would be very upset.
- No worries.

902
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:49,055
We're all good.

903
00:46:58,023 --> 00:46:59,398
Rachel. Rachel,
Rachel, Rachel.

904
00:46:59,525 --> 00:47:01,025
I need your help. There's a hearing
on my subpoena.

905
00:47:01,151 --> 00:47:02,652
I've got three cases
in front of yours.

906
00:47:02,778 --> 00:47:03,611
You're going to
have to wait in line.

907
00:47:03,737 --> 00:47:06,531
Wait. No. No, no, no.
My hearing is tomorrow.

908
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:07,657
So, why are you
coming to me?

909
00:47:08,826 --> 00:47:11,869
Because Donna says you're the best
researcher in the firm.

910
00:47:12,538 --> 00:47:14,580
Hmm. Let me see
the motion.

911
00:47:15,874 --> 00:47:19,252
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
You have an office?

912
00:47:19,378 --> 00:47:22,255
How do you have an office
and I have a cubicle?

913
00:47:22,381 --> 00:47:24,632
Like you said, I'm the best
researcher in the firm.

914
00:47:24,758 --> 00:47:26,759
Really? Well,
I just made that up.

915
00:47:26,885 --> 00:47:29,512
I didn't even have
time to talk to Donna.

916
00:47:31,139 --> 00:47:32,974
Is this all
a joke to you?

917
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:34,517
Because I take
my job seriously.

918
00:47:34,643 --> 00:47:35,852
No, I'm... I'm sorry.

919
00:47:35,978 --> 00:47:37,562
Look, I was...

920
00:47:38,730 --> 00:47:39,730
Look, you
weren't there.

921
00:47:39,857 --> 00:47:42,441
Okay? I care
about this woman.

922
00:47:43,151 --> 00:47:44,777
She's got nowhere
else to turn and...

923
00:47:44,903 --> 00:47:46,654
And you can't
help her by yourself.

924
00:47:48,282 --> 00:47:51,826
I can.
I just prefer not to.

925
00:47:53,579 --> 00:47:54,704
Okay.

926
00:47:55,455 --> 00:47:56,706
You're asking to
look at private files

927
00:47:56,832 --> 00:47:57,957
without any evidence
of your assertion.

928
00:47:58,083 --> 00:47:59,834
Yeah. But the only way that we can
find the evidence

929
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:01,085
is to look
at those files.

930
00:48:01,211 --> 00:48:02,086
That's a rickety argument.

931
00:48:02,212 --> 00:48:03,254
But is there precedent?

932
00:48:05,757 --> 00:48:07,967
Let's go see
if we can find one.

933
00:48:08,093 --> 00:48:10,720
Research is as much
art as science.

934
00:48:10,846 --> 00:48:13,639
So, we're going to look at privacy
and harassment law.

935
00:48:13,765 --> 00:48:16,684
See if we can find a combination of
cases to make an argument.

936
00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:17,894
I'll take privacy.

937
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:19,729
I'll take harassment law.

938
00:48:19,855 --> 00:48:21,272
This will take
a while.

939
00:48:21,398 --> 00:48:22,398
We're going to need dinner.

940
00:48:22,524 --> 00:48:23,774
Chinese.

941
00:48:23,901 --> 00:48:26,110
No. I can afford
Chinese on my own.

942
00:48:26,236 --> 00:48:28,779
- This is on the firm. I want sushi.
- Ooh.

943
00:48:29,907 --> 00:48:31,699
So, they told me to put my top
investigator on it.

944
00:48:31,825 --> 00:48:33,326
What did you do?

945
00:48:33,452 --> 00:48:34,744
What could I do? You were out of
the country.

946
00:48:34,870 --> 00:48:35,745
I gave them Luderman.

947
00:48:39,082 --> 00:48:40,458
Harvey, this has
been lovely,

948
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:44,378
but I believe
you know what I want.

949
00:48:44,504 --> 00:48:45,463
I think I've got
what you want.

950
00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:47,089
Well...

951
00:48:48,550 --> 00:48:49,717
By the way,
that dress...

952
00:48:49,843 --> 00:48:51,427
What, this old thing?
Come on.

953
00:48:51,553 --> 00:48:55,097
Beautiful. Why don't we
do this more often?

954
00:48:55,766 --> 00:48:57,600
Because it always
ends the same way.

955
00:48:58,685 --> 00:48:59,894
Then why are we
doing it now?

956
00:49:01,396 --> 00:49:03,314
Because you're paying me.

957
00:49:04,524 --> 00:49:06,400
Vanessa, really.

958
00:49:09,696 --> 00:49:11,072
How come you
and I never...

959
00:49:11,198 --> 00:49:14,158
Harvey, I don't
sleep around.

960
00:49:14,451 --> 00:49:16,702
And I could never be
in a relationship with you.

961
00:49:16,828 --> 00:49:18,829
All you ever think
about is yourself.

962
00:49:19,164 --> 00:49:21,666
I'm thinking about
you and me right now.

963
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:27,213
Let me get this.

964
00:49:27,756 --> 00:49:28,756
But I'm a gentleman.

965
00:49:29,132 --> 00:49:32,718
But if you get it, you might think
I'll change my mind someday.

966
00:49:33,261 --> 00:49:34,720
I already do.

967
00:49:37,557 --> 00:49:39,850
For the record,
I am not selfish everywhere.

968
00:49:40,352 --> 00:49:41,602
Neither am I.

969
00:49:48,610 --> 00:49:50,861
Mr. Dockery,
you naughty, naughty boy.

970
00:49:56,493 --> 00:49:58,577
Remember when I said you thought
you were too smart

971
00:49:58,704 --> 00:50:00,538
- to be a paralegal?
- Mmm-hmm.

972
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:02,498
- Why...
- Aren't I a lawyer?

973
00:50:05,168 --> 00:50:06,752
I don't test well.

974
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:09,213
- What?
- I... I'm smart.

975
00:50:09,589 --> 00:50:10,798
And I know I'd be
a good lawyer.

976
00:50:10,924 --> 00:50:14,427
I just... I don't know what it is.
I can't take tests.

977
00:50:14,553 --> 00:50:16,345
And I bombed
the LSATs.

978
00:50:17,139 --> 00:50:18,681
And even if I could
get into a law school,

979
00:50:18,807 --> 00:50:20,474
there's just no way
I'd pass the bar.

980
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:23,352
So, if only
there were someone

981
00:50:23,478 --> 00:50:25,646
who could take
the tests for me.

982
00:50:26,064 --> 00:50:27,273
Yeah, if only
there were.

983
00:50:27,399 --> 00:50:28,482
Yeah.

984
00:50:28,608 --> 00:50:31,402
Mike, where are you at with the research
for tomorrow's hearing?

985
00:50:31,528 --> 00:50:33,571
Uh, nothing yet.

986
00:50:33,697 --> 00:50:34,572
You say you care
about the client,

987
00:50:34,698 --> 00:50:37,324
but if you keep playing footsie instead
of finding me an argument,

988
00:50:37,451 --> 00:50:39,368
the client's
going to lose.

989
00:50:39,494 --> 00:50:40,494
I don't want
to lose.

990
00:50:43,582 --> 00:50:47,460
Look, it's no use, okay?

991
00:50:47,586 --> 00:50:48,669
Their investigation
is by the book.

992
00:50:48,795 --> 00:50:50,046
We look like
the bad guys coming in,

993
00:50:50,172 --> 00:50:51,422
putting them
under duress.

994
00:50:52,466 --> 00:50:53,466
What did you just say?

995
00:50:53,592 --> 00:50:55,259
I said we look
like the bad guys.

996
00:50:55,385 --> 00:50:57,636
No. You said they
did it by the book,

997
00:50:57,763 --> 00:51:00,097
and we're putting them
under duress.

998
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:01,307
Yeah?

999
00:51:04,936 --> 00:51:05,936
Look.

1000
00:51:06,688 --> 00:51:07,688
Hmm.

1001
00:51:09,858 --> 00:51:11,942
This is good. We're going to
have some fun.

1002
00:51:12,486 --> 00:51:14,528
We? I get to go?

1003
00:51:14,654 --> 00:51:15,905
You didn't think I would let you
come along?

1004
00:51:16,031 --> 00:51:17,448
- No.
- Good instinct.

1005
00:51:17,574 --> 00:51:19,241
I wasn't. But then, I thought it
would be cruel

1006
00:51:19,367 --> 00:51:20,910
not to let you
witness my greatness.

1007
00:51:21,036 --> 00:51:22,536
Okay. Can I go
get my bag?

1008
00:51:22,662 --> 00:51:24,121
No.

1009
00:51:24,247 --> 00:51:25,831
- You're a true giver.
- Other side.

1010
00:51:25,957 --> 00:51:27,041
Okay.

1011
00:51:29,127 --> 00:51:31,128
Your Honor, this case
should be thrown out.

1012
00:51:31,254 --> 00:51:34,423
Other than her story, the plaintiff
doesn't have one piece of evidence.

1013
00:51:34,549 --> 00:51:37,093
Because the evidence
lies within their personnel files,

1014
00:51:37,219 --> 00:51:39,470
which they're conveniently
refusing to hand over.

1015
00:51:39,596 --> 00:51:41,597
Those files contain
sensitive information.

1016
00:51:41,723 --> 00:51:44,975
He's fishing at the expense
of our employees' right to privacy.

1017
00:51:45,102 --> 00:51:45,935
Please.

1018
00:51:46,061 --> 00:51:48,854
He doesn't give a rat's ass
about his employees' right to privacy.

1019
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:52,024
Sorry. That's actually
unfair to rats' asses.

1020
00:51:52,150 --> 00:51:55,152
Your Honor, Mr. Specter's claim that we
don't care about our employees,

1021
00:51:55,278 --> 00:51:58,239
though belittling, doesn't carry any
weight as a rule of law.

1022
00:51:58,365 --> 00:52:00,991
True. But what does carry weight is that
an investigation of

1023
00:52:01,118 --> 00:52:04,036
sexual harassment must be conducted
without any duress.

1024
00:52:04,162 --> 00:52:05,246
Your point?

1025
00:52:05,664 --> 00:52:08,082
The investigator and every person
being interviewed

1026
00:52:08,583 --> 00:52:10,835
answers to the CEO
they're investigating.

1027
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:14,380
That is the definition
of duress.

1028
00:52:16,091 --> 00:52:19,135
It would be as if your bailiff accused
you of sexual harassment,

1029
00:52:19,261 --> 00:52:22,012
and you assigned your stenographer
to investigate.

1030
00:52:22,139 --> 00:52:26,684
Now, how likely would it be that this
investigation yielded any fruit?

1031
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:29,895
You honestly think
I would harass Herman?

1032
00:52:30,021 --> 00:52:31,230
Well, I don't know,
Your Honor.

1033
00:52:31,356 --> 00:52:33,149
Some people have a thing
for the uniform.

1034
00:52:33,275 --> 00:52:36,152
Uh, I'd like to think
Herman would come to me

1035
00:52:36,278 --> 00:52:38,529
before it even got
to an investigation.

1036
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:42,992
I saw that.
That should be stricken.

1037
00:52:43,118 --> 00:52:45,327
But what if Herman did
come to you, Your Honor?

1038
00:52:45,453 --> 00:52:49,707
And you betrayed his trust by firing him
under false pretenses?

1039
00:52:49,833 --> 00:52:51,083
You really think
that little of me?

1040
00:52:51,626 --> 00:52:55,963
I wouldn't trust you
as far as I can throw you, Your Honor.

1041
00:52:58,466 --> 00:53:00,134
- Hand over the files.
- Oh, my...

1042
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:01,927
Today.

1043
00:53:02,053 --> 00:53:02,928
That's it.

1044
00:53:03,054 --> 00:53:04,096
Herman?

1045
00:53:05,056 --> 00:53:07,725
I'd like to speak
to you in chambers.

1046
00:53:09,144 --> 00:53:10,269
That was awesome.

1047
00:53:10,395 --> 00:53:12,771
It was your argument.
I just framed it in a way

1048
00:53:12,898 --> 00:53:15,441
that humanized the situation and
brightened all of our afternoons.

1049
00:53:15,567 --> 00:53:17,151
I feel like
Michael Corleone in that scene

1050
00:53:17,277 --> 00:53:19,320
where that fat guy teaches him how
to shoot that gun.

1051
00:53:19,446 --> 00:53:20,571
Are you saying that
I'm the fat guy?

1052
00:53:20,697 --> 00:53:21,947
Because I'm not
the fat guy.

1053
00:53:22,073 --> 00:53:23,240
Mmm.

1054
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:26,243
Do you know what
his name was?

1055
00:53:26,369 --> 00:53:27,828
- Yeah.
- Cardoza.

1056
00:53:27,954 --> 00:53:29,038
- Clemenza.
- I knew that.

1057
00:53:29,164 --> 00:53:30,956
I was just testing
to see if you knew it.

1058
00:53:31,082 --> 00:53:33,125
I knew that you
knew that I knew.

1059
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:49,058
Train wreck.

1060
00:53:50,393 --> 00:53:52,978
Hey. I'm looking
for Rene?

1061
00:53:53,104 --> 00:53:54,897
I'm Rene.
I'm sorry.

1062
00:53:55,023 --> 00:53:57,942
We don't sell skinny
jeans at this location.

1063
00:54:00,111 --> 00:54:01,904
Did Harvey tell you
I was coming, or...

1064
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:04,073
Harvey Specter sent you?

1065
00:54:04,199 --> 00:54:07,159
That's another story.
Do you know your inseam?

1066
00:54:07,577 --> 00:54:09,912
I don't.
It's probably a medium.

1067
00:54:11,331 --> 00:54:12,831
Why don't you
browse for a while?

1068
00:54:12,958 --> 00:54:13,874
These are the most exclusive,

1069
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,418
and we move down in price as you head to
the door.

1070
00:54:19,172 --> 00:54:20,339
Oh!

1071
00:54:20,799 --> 00:54:22,216
Okay.

1072
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:26,971
Large?

1073
00:54:29,266 --> 00:54:31,225
That's not how it works.

1074
00:54:32,227 --> 00:54:33,310
Huh.

1075
00:55:14,644 --> 00:55:17,271
So, Trevor's getting you to do his dirty
work for him, huh?

1076
00:55:17,397 --> 00:55:20,399
All I know is you aren't talking
to each other.

1077
00:55:20,525 --> 00:55:23,861
I miss you. I want things to go back
to the way they were.

1078
00:55:23,987 --> 00:55:24,945
I miss you, too.

1079
00:55:25,071 --> 00:55:29,033
But I'm not sure things are ever going
back to the way they were.

1080
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:30,451
I've got to go.

1081
00:55:31,995 --> 00:55:33,370
What did he say?

1082
00:55:33,496 --> 00:55:37,249
He said things aren't ever going back to
the way they were.

1083
00:55:37,876 --> 00:55:39,585
What did you do?

1084
00:55:39,836 --> 00:55:41,170
I don't know.

1085
00:55:47,093 --> 00:55:47,926
Hey!

1086
00:55:48,553 --> 00:55:50,637
So the files
are on their way.

1087
00:55:50,764 --> 00:55:52,681
We won?
That's fantastic.

1088
00:55:52,807 --> 00:55:55,768
So we have a week to corroborate
Nancy's story.

1089
00:55:56,519 --> 00:55:59,772
Listen, I couldn't have
done it without you.

1090
00:56:00,815 --> 00:56:03,108
You wouldn't even know
where to look without me.

1091
00:56:03,234 --> 00:56:04,485
- You know what nobody likes?
- Hmm?

1092
00:56:04,611 --> 00:56:05,944
Nobody likes a show-off.

1093
00:56:09,699 --> 00:56:11,533
Hello? Yeah, he's here.

1094
00:56:12,410 --> 00:56:13,911
Okay, thank you.

1095
00:56:14,871 --> 00:56:16,455
The files are in
conference room C.

1096
00:56:16,998 --> 00:56:19,083
Why wouldn't they
bring them to my cubicle?

1097
00:56:20,293 --> 00:56:22,252
They're trying to
bury you in paperwork.

1098
00:56:22,379 --> 00:56:25,506
Well, they picked
the wrong guy.

1099
00:56:25,632 --> 00:56:28,384
If they didn't, I did.
Get it done by the end of the week.

1100
00:56:28,510 --> 00:56:31,011
I've got to run and
charm a new client.

1101
00:56:36,976 --> 00:56:38,936
Nice to finally meet you.

1102
00:56:39,062 --> 00:56:42,147
Jessica says you're going to
sweep me off my feet.

1103
00:56:42,273 --> 00:56:44,108
I'll do my best,
Mr. Dockery.

1104
00:56:44,234 --> 00:56:45,651
You've got a nice
serve there.

1105
00:56:45,777 --> 00:56:47,111
Working on it.

1106
00:56:50,698 --> 00:56:51,573
What the hell is this?

1107
00:56:51,699 --> 00:56:54,326
It's you having sex with a woman who
isn't Mrs. Dockery.

1108
00:56:55,036 --> 00:56:56,328
Are you trying
to blackmail me?

1109
00:56:56,454 --> 00:57:00,165
You asked my firm where you're
vulnerable to corporate take-over.

1110
00:57:00,291 --> 00:57:01,917
- That's it, right there.
- What are you pulling here?

1111
00:57:02,043 --> 00:57:05,421
Your wife owns
10% of the company's voting shares.

1112
00:57:05,547 --> 00:57:08,715
You've been seeing this woman and
several others for quite some time.

1113
00:57:08,842 --> 00:57:11,176
How do you think your wife's going to
vote after she finds out?

1114
00:57:11,594 --> 00:57:13,095
Who says she
has to find out?

1115
00:57:13,471 --> 00:57:16,265
My investigator got
these within a week.

1116
00:57:16,391 --> 00:57:20,185
What do you think a motivated competitor
is going to dig up in a year?

1117
00:57:22,856 --> 00:57:24,606
I have a solution.

1118
00:57:24,941 --> 00:57:26,859
Trade her your
preferred shares,

1119
00:57:26,985 --> 00:57:30,070
which have no voting rights,
for her common shares, which do.

1120
00:57:30,196 --> 00:57:32,322
The preferred shares
are worth $2,000,000 more.

1121
00:57:32,449 --> 00:57:35,409
A fraction of what you'll lose if you
get voted out of your company.

1122
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:38,245
John, I don't care if you sleep with
every woman in the Hamptons.

1123
00:57:38,746 --> 00:57:40,831
Just give her
the preferred shares.

1124
00:57:43,168 --> 00:57:46,295
Jessica said you were going to charm me
to get my business.

1125
00:57:46,421 --> 00:57:48,172
I'm not interested in
getting your business.

1126
00:57:48,298 --> 00:57:50,174
I'm interested
in keeping it.

1127
00:57:52,927 --> 00:57:55,888
Now, shall we play? I'm not going
to let you win.

1128
00:57:56,389 --> 00:57:58,432
I know where they
don't want us to look.

1129
00:57:58,975 --> 00:58:01,059
Did you get through
all those files in one night?

1130
00:58:01,186 --> 00:58:04,104
I would have done it faster,
but I ordered a pizza.

1131
00:58:04,522 --> 00:58:07,733
Speaking of which, have you ever had
the cheese in the crust?

1132
00:58:07,859 --> 00:58:09,359
Because it blew my mind.

1133
00:58:09,694 --> 00:58:10,903
What did you find?

1134
00:58:11,029 --> 00:58:13,822
There was a dismissal
on March 12th, 2005.

1135
00:58:13,948 --> 00:58:15,908
But the file with the employee name
on it is missing.

1136
00:58:16,534 --> 00:58:18,035
That's our woman.
I know it is.

1137
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:21,747
I'm moving to slap sanctions on their
attorney, possible jail time.

1138
00:58:21,873 --> 00:58:23,040
The guy is not going
to know what hit him.

1139
00:58:24,918 --> 00:58:27,085
Dennis, it's Harvey Specter.

1140
00:58:27,212 --> 00:58:30,547
Did you have anything to do with
the March 12th, 2005,

1141
00:58:30,673 --> 00:58:31,673
files left out of discovery?

1142
00:58:33,885 --> 00:58:36,970
If they're here by noon, I'll believe
you. If not, we're filing for sanctions.

1143
00:58:38,598 --> 00:58:40,891
Threat of sanctions is better than
filing for sanctions.

1144
00:58:41,017 --> 00:58:44,811
That's what I meant. Threaten, not file.
Who would mean that?

1145
00:58:46,064 --> 00:58:47,064
Shave.

1146
00:58:48,358 --> 00:58:51,151
Have you ever heard of this woman?
Joanna Webster?

1147
00:58:51,277 --> 00:58:52,736
No. Why?

1148
00:58:52,862 --> 00:58:54,154
The company has
tried to hide her from us.

1149
00:58:54,906 --> 00:58:59,117
She met with personnel
over work-related issues in 2005.

1150
00:58:59,244 --> 00:59:00,827
And then, they fired her
two months later.

1151
00:59:00,954 --> 00:59:03,163
You think Hunt did
the same thing to her that he did to me?

1152
00:59:03,289 --> 00:59:04,164
Yes, I do.

1153
00:59:04,290 --> 00:59:06,750
Then you have to make her come
forward and say so.

1154
00:59:06,876 --> 00:59:08,669
Yeah. That's the plan.

1155
00:59:09,254 --> 00:59:10,254
Okay.

1156
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:12,548
Um... Uh, actually,
before you go,

1157
00:59:12,674 --> 00:59:16,093
can I get you to sign
this engagement letter?

1158
00:59:16,803 --> 00:59:19,388
Evidently, it's something
you're supposed to do

1159
00:59:19,514 --> 00:59:20,556
at the beginning.

1160
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:24,935
Perfect.

1161
00:59:25,478 --> 00:59:27,062
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1162
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:42,828
Joanna Webster?

1163
00:59:42,954 --> 00:59:43,996
Can I help you?

1164
00:59:44,122 --> 00:59:47,165
Hi, uh, my name is Mike Ross.
I'm a lawyer.

1165
00:59:47,875 --> 00:59:50,836
I have some questions for you about your
time at Devlin McGreggor.

1166
00:59:52,130 --> 00:59:53,422
Uh, please! Look...

1167
00:59:53,715 --> 00:59:56,258
Just let me tell you a story about
my client, okay?

1168
00:59:56,384 --> 00:59:57,801
I've got to get these
in the fridge

1169
00:59:57,927 --> 00:59:59,636
It will just
take a second.

1170
01:00:00,305 --> 01:00:01,680
Fine.

1171
01:00:03,558 --> 01:00:06,184
Look, all I need you to do
is to tell your story.

1172
01:00:06,311 --> 01:00:07,311
If you corroborate with...

1173
01:00:07,437 --> 01:00:10,772
Mr. Ross, what happened to me
happened six years ago.

1174
01:00:11,065 --> 01:00:12,941
It was horrible
and there was a reason

1175
01:00:13,067 --> 01:00:14,985
I didn't do
anything about it.

1176
01:00:15,111 --> 01:00:18,572
They'll put me on that stand and attack
me, and I don't want that.

1177
01:00:18,698 --> 01:00:20,324
Ms. Webster.

1178
01:00:20,658 --> 01:00:24,494
Joanna.
This man is a predator.

1179
01:00:25,872 --> 01:00:28,457
And if you don't help stop him,
he will do it again.

1180
01:00:31,336 --> 01:00:33,045
All you have to do
is give a deposition...

1181
01:00:33,171 --> 01:00:34,379
I'm sorry.

1182
01:00:35,048 --> 01:00:36,715
I can't do it.

1183
01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:48,560
What happened
with the witness?

1184
01:00:51,189 --> 01:00:52,272
I failed.

1185
01:00:53,566 --> 01:00:55,233
To not be awesome.

1186
01:00:57,945 --> 01:00:59,196
I got her to testify.

1187
01:00:59,947 --> 01:01:02,407
You should have seen me.
I tried everything.

1188
01:01:02,533 --> 01:01:03,492
He'd do it again.

1189
01:01:03,618 --> 01:01:05,202
I'd be with her
every step of the way.

1190
01:01:05,328 --> 01:01:06,495
Nothing worked.

1191
01:01:06,621 --> 01:01:08,288
And then, it hit me.

1192
01:01:09,457 --> 01:01:14,002
I asked her, what if it was her daughter
that he did this to?

1193
01:01:15,129 --> 01:01:16,880
She melted.

1194
01:01:17,006 --> 01:01:20,008
Oh, and you know how I came up
with that little gem?

1195
01:01:20,134 --> 01:01:21,718
I cared about her.

1196
01:01:21,844 --> 01:01:23,136
Oh!

1197
01:01:26,391 --> 01:01:27,891
Yeah. Thank you.

1198
01:01:28,017 --> 01:01:29,434
I'm glad to see that staying up all
night

1199
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:31,478
doesn't make you
act like a complete idiot.

1200
01:01:31,604 --> 01:01:32,521
Now, go home and get some sleep.

1201
01:01:32,647 --> 01:01:35,023
I don't want you waving that thing
around during tomorrow's deposition.

1202
01:01:41,823 --> 01:01:44,741
Harvey.
How's the pro bono going?

1203
01:01:45,785 --> 01:01:48,578
Great! I just talked
a witness into testifying.

1204
01:01:48,830 --> 01:01:51,206
Really?
What's the witness' name?

1205
01:01:53,835 --> 01:01:56,712
I'm not an idiot.
Don't treat me like one.

1206
01:01:56,838 --> 01:01:58,130
You pawned off the case.

1207
01:01:58,673 --> 01:02:00,716
Jessica, I've got higher
profile cases. I...

1208
01:02:00,842 --> 01:02:04,386
Need I remind you that when we first
met, you were a screw-up?

1209
01:02:05,179 --> 01:02:07,264
I gave you a shot at the mail room,
led you up the ranks,

1210
01:02:07,390 --> 01:02:09,433
and then paid for you
to go to Harvard,

1211
01:02:09,559 --> 01:02:12,978
where, by the way, you jerked off the
entire time you were there.

1212
01:02:13,104 --> 01:02:15,230
And I still hired you.

1213
01:02:15,356 --> 01:02:17,065
And you've benefited
from that ever since.

1214
01:02:17,191 --> 01:02:19,234
Look, I closed
the Dockery case, okay?

1215
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:20,944
You made
a promise to me.

1216
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:24,114
You broke it, and then
you lied to my face.

1217
01:02:25,158 --> 01:02:27,868
So let me be clear.
This isn't professional.

1218
01:02:27,994 --> 01:02:29,077
This is personal.

1219
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:31,121
And I'll tell you
something else,

1220
01:02:31,247 --> 01:02:33,957
you made your bet,
you better goddamn win.

1221
01:03:02,445 --> 01:03:03,779
What the hell
is wrong with you?

1222
01:03:03,905 --> 01:03:05,238
I need the briefcase back.

1223
01:03:05,364 --> 01:03:06,698
Oh, so that's what this
has been about, huh?

1224
01:03:06,824 --> 01:03:08,784
You don't care about
our friendship at all.

1225
01:03:08,910 --> 01:03:10,368
You're my oldest friend
and you know it.

1226
01:03:10,495 --> 01:03:12,454
But you don't seem to
care about that anymore.

1227
01:03:12,580 --> 01:03:14,247
And, yeah, I need
the briefcase back.

1228
01:03:14,373 --> 01:03:15,791
And I'm going
to find it, Mike.

1229
01:03:15,917 --> 01:03:17,959
Well, I ditched it when I was running
away from the cops

1230
01:03:18,085 --> 01:03:19,961
that you sent me into.

1231
01:03:56,290 --> 01:03:57,332
Mike?

1232
01:03:58,835 --> 01:04:00,252
Where are you going?

1233
01:04:00,628 --> 01:04:01,628
To my cubicle.

1234
01:04:01,754 --> 01:04:04,464
No. You're not.
It's pee-in-a-cup time.

1235
01:04:06,259 --> 01:04:07,676
I'm sorry. What?

1236
01:04:07,802 --> 01:04:09,553
Drug test. Follow me.

1237
01:04:11,889 --> 01:04:13,139
Uh, I'm just going to
put my stuff back...

1238
01:04:13,266 --> 01:04:14,307
Now.

1239
01:04:25,862 --> 01:04:29,614
Oh, by the way, um,
my cousin was your year at Harvard,

1240
01:04:29,740 --> 01:04:31,575
and I asked him
if he knew you.

1241
01:04:31,701 --> 01:04:34,160
It's so funny. He didn't.

1242
01:04:34,620 --> 01:04:36,663
- Well, what's his name?
- Mitch Samberg.

1243
01:04:36,956 --> 01:04:38,498
Yeah. Don't know him.

1244
01:04:40,626 --> 01:04:42,252
It's a big school.

1245
01:04:42,503 --> 01:04:43,378
Not really.

1246
01:04:43,504 --> 01:04:45,630
We get 7,000
applications a year.

1247
01:04:45,756 --> 01:04:48,258
You think you can just
walk in and take a tour?

1248
01:04:48,551 --> 01:04:50,260
Oh! Mitchell.

1249
01:04:50,553 --> 01:04:51,970
With the slicked
back hair?

1250
01:04:52,096 --> 01:04:53,221
Graduated seventh
in the class.

1251
01:04:53,347 --> 01:04:55,473
Sure. Yeah.
I remember him.

1252
01:04:56,601 --> 01:04:57,726
Time to face the music.

1253
01:05:08,487 --> 01:05:09,529
Yeah. What's up?

1254
01:05:09,655 --> 01:05:11,990
I've got to get to the Kendrick filing.
Where the hell is Mike?

1255
01:05:12,116 --> 01:05:13,408
I don't know.

1256
01:05:16,037 --> 01:05:17,787
Leave the cup
on the counter.

1257
01:05:22,126 --> 01:05:24,294
Oh, you'll have to
leave that out here.

1258
01:05:24,420 --> 01:05:25,420
Why?

1259
01:05:25,546 --> 01:05:26,421
If you take it
in there with you,

1260
01:05:26,547 --> 01:05:28,423
I have to check to make sure you don't
have another urine sample.

1261
01:05:29,050 --> 01:05:30,717
Oh, you...

1262
01:06:22,228 --> 01:06:24,688
- Where have you been?
- Hi! Um...

1263
01:06:25,606 --> 01:06:27,524
Getting drug
tested, actually.

1264
01:06:27,650 --> 01:06:29,317
The deposition
is this afternoon.

1265
01:06:29,443 --> 01:06:30,443
Before they get here,

1266
01:06:30,569 --> 01:06:32,487
I want you to grill this woman about
her background

1267
01:06:32,613 --> 01:06:34,572
for anything they might use against her.
You got it?

1268
01:06:34,699 --> 01:06:36,157
- Got it.
- Make her tell you everything.

1269
01:06:36,283 --> 01:06:37,409
- Everything.
- Everything.

1270
01:06:37,535 --> 01:06:38,994
- Everything.
- Okay.

1271
01:06:39,787 --> 01:06:40,954
Okay.

1272
01:06:49,714 --> 01:06:54,801
I'd been working six months when Mr.
Hunt started asking me to work more.

1273
01:06:55,386 --> 01:06:56,761
Order dinner.

1274
01:06:56,887 --> 01:06:59,014
One night, late,

1275
01:06:59,140 --> 01:07:00,890
he tried to have
sex with me.

1276
01:07:01,726 --> 01:07:04,769
The next day, I requested
a change in assignment.

1277
01:07:05,563 --> 01:07:08,815
Two months later, I was fired for having
a bad attitude.

1278
01:07:09,608 --> 01:07:11,359
This is ridiculous.

1279
01:07:11,610 --> 01:07:13,028
Wipe that smirk
off your face.

1280
01:07:13,154 --> 01:07:14,571
You're not even
supposed to be here.

1281
01:07:14,905 --> 01:07:16,990
Mr. Hunt has every
right to be here.

1282
01:07:17,116 --> 01:07:20,493
Now, Ms. Webster, after working for
Devlin McGreggor,

1283
01:07:20,619 --> 01:07:24,205
you then went on to waitress
at Hooters, right?

1284
01:07:24,957 --> 01:07:25,957
Yes, I did.

1285
01:07:26,250 --> 01:07:29,836
A place that advertises the sexuality
of its wait-staff, correct?

1286
01:07:30,838 --> 01:07:32,213
You'll have to
ask them that.

1287
01:07:33,007 --> 01:07:33,882
I'm asking you.

1288
01:07:34,008 --> 01:07:36,593
And she's not answering.
Move on.

1289
01:07:38,846 --> 01:07:43,558
Ms. Webster, would you say that
you're a truthful person?

1290
01:07:45,186 --> 01:07:46,061
Yes.

1291
01:07:46,187 --> 01:07:50,023
Yeah. So, when you said earlier that you
had never been arrested for a crime,

1292
01:07:50,149 --> 01:07:52,150
you were, uh,
speaking the truth?

1293
01:07:52,401 --> 01:07:53,777
- Yes.
- Yes.

1294
01:07:53,903 --> 01:07:57,197
So, in 1993, then,
you were not arrested for stealing

1295
01:07:57,490 --> 01:08:01,493
$1,000 worth of jewelry from the Willow
Grove Mall in Pennsylvania.

1296
01:08:03,621 --> 01:08:05,121
I was 17!

1297
01:08:05,915 --> 01:08:08,708
That was one mistake. Those records were
supposed to be sealed.

1298
01:08:08,834 --> 01:08:11,461
So when you say those records were
sealed, what you mean to say

1299
01:08:11,587 --> 01:08:13,922
is you thought you could get
away with a lie.

1300
01:08:14,048 --> 01:08:17,217
No, that's not it. You're making it
seem different than it is.

1301
01:08:17,343 --> 01:08:19,928
I'm sorry. You were arrested in your
past

1302
01:08:20,054 --> 01:08:21,262
and you lied about it here under oath.

1303
01:08:21,388 --> 01:08:24,599
Is that making it seem
different than what it is?

1304
01:08:28,521 --> 01:08:30,480
No answer.
Hmm. All right.

1305
01:08:31,107 --> 01:08:34,275
Um, let me ask you this,
since you've lied here once,

1306
01:08:34,401 --> 01:08:37,028
what's to make us believe you're not
lying about Mr. Hunt?

1307
01:08:46,122 --> 01:08:48,164
Well, thank you.

1308
01:08:50,376 --> 01:08:51,876
How the hell did you
miss that arrest?

1309
01:08:52,002 --> 01:08:53,711
No. I did every
background check we have.

1310
01:08:53,838 --> 01:08:55,296
Did you grill her
like I told you to?

1311
01:08:55,422 --> 01:08:56,965
It was
a sealed record, Harvey.

1312
01:08:57,091 --> 01:08:59,342
God damn it,
I knew it. Fix it.

1313
01:09:07,268 --> 01:09:08,893
Joanna! Wait! Please!

1314
01:09:09,019 --> 01:09:11,271
This is why I didn't
want to testify.

1315
01:09:11,397 --> 01:09:14,482
They twist something from a hundred
years ago and make me look like a liar.

1316
01:09:14,608 --> 01:09:16,776
They make it sound like what he did
to me didn't happen.

1317
01:09:16,902 --> 01:09:18,486
Look, it doesn't matter.
All right?

1318
01:09:18,612 --> 01:09:22,073
I need you to testify on Friday and
keep this case alive.

1319
01:09:22,199 --> 01:09:25,201
We don't have time to find anyone else
before then. Would you please wait?

1320
01:09:25,327 --> 01:09:28,872
No! I'm not waiting. You promised this
wouldn't happen, and it did.

1321
01:09:28,998 --> 01:09:31,291
You never told me
you were arrested.

1322
01:09:31,417 --> 01:09:33,543
Don't contact
me again. Please?

1323
01:10:11,790 --> 01:10:14,083
What happened
with the witness?

1324
01:10:14,710 --> 01:10:17,587
Nothing. Nothing happened.
I couldn't fix it.

1325
01:10:18,631 --> 01:10:20,590
So you're going to quit?

1326
01:10:21,383 --> 01:10:23,760
It's either that or have Louis Litt
fire me.

1327
01:10:23,886 --> 01:10:25,220
What are you
talking about?

1328
01:10:25,346 --> 01:10:28,640
My first day, Louis fired Gary Lipsky
for screwing up a case.

1329
01:10:28,766 --> 01:10:32,518
He said if I did the same thing,
I'd be gone just as fast.

1330
01:10:32,811 --> 01:10:34,187
Well, you go back
to the witness' house

1331
01:10:34,313 --> 01:10:35,688
and you get her
to testify again.

1332
01:10:35,814 --> 01:10:36,981
I tried.
There's no way.

1333
01:10:37,107 --> 01:10:37,982
There's always a way.

1334
01:10:38,108 --> 01:10:39,317
Then why don't you go
and convince her?

1335
01:10:39,443 --> 01:10:40,860
Because you screwed it up.

1336
01:10:40,986 --> 01:10:42,779
Oh, and you don't give a damn about
the client. Right.

1337
01:10:42,905 --> 01:10:43,863
That's not my job.

1338
01:10:43,989 --> 01:10:45,490
Does your job include
giving a damn about me?

1339
01:10:45,616 --> 01:10:48,284
Because the least you could do is offer
to stand up to Louis for me.

1340
01:10:48,410 --> 01:10:50,453
Stand up for you? I put my ass on
the line for you.

1341
01:10:50,579 --> 01:10:53,248
But it turns out you may have had
the balls to get this job,

1342
01:10:53,374 --> 01:10:55,792
but you don't have the courage to stick
it out when it gets tough.

1343
01:10:55,918 --> 01:10:57,126
- That's not true.
- Isn't it?

1344
01:10:57,753 --> 01:10:59,712
You've had one foot out the door
since you got here.

1345
01:10:59,838 --> 01:11:00,797
What are you
talking about?

1346
01:11:00,923 --> 01:11:03,341
I'm talking about that briefcase being
locked in your desk.

1347
01:11:03,467 --> 01:11:05,468
Yeah, I saw it.
And I know what it is.

1348
01:11:05,594 --> 01:11:08,304
It's your backup plan
in case this doesn't work out.

1349
01:11:08,430 --> 01:11:11,307
You can make some quick cash and go
right back to the life you told me

1350
01:11:11,433 --> 01:11:13,351
you didn't
want to lead.

1351
01:11:13,477 --> 01:11:14,894
So, if you want
to quit, go ahead.

1352
01:11:15,020 --> 01:11:17,480
But this isn't because of Louis and it
isn't because of me.

1353
01:11:17,606 --> 01:11:19,357
It's because you're afraid you might
have to admit

1354
01:11:19,483 --> 01:11:21,901
that you're not as smart as you
think you are.

1355
01:11:26,156 --> 01:11:29,158
If you're here in the morning, I'll know
I still have an associate.

1356
01:12:22,171 --> 01:12:25,715
Hey, I get that you were upset that I
was promoted before you,

1357
01:12:25,841 --> 01:12:28,551
but if you ever threaten to fire one of
my guys again,

1358
01:12:28,677 --> 01:12:30,428
I am going to kick your ass.

1359
01:12:31,555 --> 01:12:34,098
Hmm. What are you
talking about?

1360
01:12:34,224 --> 01:12:36,100
Don't play dumb
with me, all right?

1361
01:12:36,226 --> 01:12:39,062
You fired Gary Lipsky
in front of Mike Ross.

1362
01:12:40,856 --> 01:12:42,607
What's so funny?

1363
01:12:43,359 --> 01:12:45,526
Gary Lipsky works
in the mail room.

1364
01:12:45,652 --> 01:12:46,861
What?

1365
01:12:46,987 --> 01:12:48,696
I didn't fire anyone.

1366
01:12:49,615 --> 01:12:52,408
That's how I let the new associates know
what's expected of them.

1367
01:12:53,494 --> 01:12:56,788
You plant a fake
employee to manipulate the associ...

1368
01:12:57,581 --> 01:12:58,498
That's it.

1369
01:12:59,875 --> 01:13:01,000
What?

1370
01:13:29,446 --> 01:13:30,655
Mike!

1371
01:13:33,492 --> 01:13:34,534
I wanna quit.

1372
01:13:36,745 --> 01:13:38,162
Come here.

1373
01:13:48,132 --> 01:13:50,007
When your parents died,

1374
01:13:50,342 --> 01:13:51,926
I lost my son,

1375
01:13:52,719 --> 01:13:55,888
my daughter-in-law.
I was scared,

1376
01:13:56,849 --> 01:13:59,976
alone, and I was
too old to raise you.

1377
01:14:01,103 --> 01:14:06,232
But I had no choice, because who else
was going to take care of my grandson?

1378
01:14:08,610 --> 01:14:10,903
You made me
a promise before.

1379
01:14:12,448 --> 01:14:14,532
You're in the door.

1380
01:14:15,826 --> 01:14:21,164
Promise me now the only way you'll leave
is if they rip you out.

1381
01:14:37,306 --> 01:14:41,142
You can save your breath. There's no way
I'm testifying at the hearing tomorrow.

1382
01:14:42,311 --> 01:14:44,896
That's not why I'm here.
I know what you did.

1383
01:14:45,022 --> 01:14:45,980
What are you
talking about?

1384
01:14:46,106 --> 01:14:48,608
You never worked
for Devlin McGreggor.

1385
01:14:48,734 --> 01:14:50,443
And you were never
harassed by Mr. Hunt.

1386
01:14:50,569 --> 01:14:51,903
- That's a lie.
- Look, I could tell you

1387
01:14:52,029 --> 01:14:53,237
that I've got
the canceled checks

1388
01:14:53,363 --> 01:14:56,324
or the wire transfer
or whatever smoking gun that exists.

1389
01:14:56,783 --> 01:15:00,036
I don't. But I will. And when I do,
you'll be going to jail.

1390
01:15:00,162 --> 01:15:02,914
Unless you tell me
what happened, right now.

1391
01:15:05,125 --> 01:15:06,876
I'm the guy you tell.

1392
01:15:10,422 --> 01:15:14,091
All I had to do was waste your time
until tomorrow after the hearing.

1393
01:15:16,094 --> 01:15:18,596
Please. I just
needed the money.

1394
01:15:19,223 --> 01:15:21,057
I don't want to go to jail.

1395
01:15:23,268 --> 01:15:24,560
Here's what
you're going to do.

1396
01:15:25,103 --> 01:15:27,146
What's with the attitude?
That's just really, uh...

1397
01:15:27,898 --> 01:15:30,024
- Mike!
- Hey!

1398
01:15:30,150 --> 01:15:32,443
I'm not giving this to
you because you need it.

1399
01:15:32,569 --> 01:15:34,570
I'm giving it to you
because I don't.

1400
01:15:35,656 --> 01:15:37,907
And I don't know if I'm ready to forgive
you yet or not,

1401
01:15:38,575 --> 01:15:39,492
but I do know we're even.

1402
01:15:42,663 --> 01:15:44,080
Wait a second.

1403
01:15:47,876 --> 01:15:49,418
I didn't...

1404
01:15:49,711 --> 01:15:51,170
I don't...

1405
01:15:58,470 --> 01:15:59,470
Don't.

1406
01:16:00,430 --> 01:16:01,847
Now we're even.

1407
01:16:04,768 --> 01:16:05,768
Huh.

1408
01:16:21,952 --> 01:16:24,203
I see you came
to work today.

1409
01:16:24,329 --> 01:16:25,705
Nice suit.

1410
01:16:25,831 --> 01:16:28,207
It was
a barter transaction.

1411
01:16:28,333 --> 01:16:30,543
I got six of them for
one little briefcase.

1412
01:16:34,756 --> 01:16:36,090
Listen, uh,

1413
01:16:38,010 --> 01:16:39,218
I'm sorry and...

1414
01:16:39,344 --> 01:16:40,303
Forget it.

1415
01:16:42,848 --> 01:16:47,143
When I first started, Jessica rode me so
hard, I quit once a month.

1416
01:16:48,729 --> 01:16:50,813
I just told you what
you needed to hear.

1417
01:16:50,939 --> 01:16:52,440
That's just it.

1418
01:16:52,858 --> 01:16:55,901
I've only ever had one person who told
me what I needed to hear.

1419
01:16:57,654 --> 01:17:00,615
Maybe it's time
I started trusting somebody else.

1420
01:17:10,709 --> 01:17:12,460
Merry Christmas.

1421
01:17:17,633 --> 01:17:18,507
Is this for real?

1422
01:17:18,967 --> 01:17:20,760
You know what to do.

1423
01:17:23,013 --> 01:17:24,680
Press until it hurts.

1424
01:17:36,151 --> 01:17:40,029
Wire transfer from your account
to Joanna Webster's.

1425
01:17:40,530 --> 01:17:44,617
Phone records with Joanna Webster prior
to her testimony.

1426
01:17:45,494 --> 01:17:49,205
And an affidavit stating you paid
Ms. Webster to falsely testify.

1427
01:17:51,041 --> 01:17:54,085
Mr. Hunt, harassment is
a civil violation.

1428
01:17:54,211 --> 01:17:55,127
The penalty is money.

1429
01:17:55,253 --> 01:17:58,673
But witness tampering, that's a crime,
and you will go to prison,

1430
01:17:58,799 --> 01:18:01,133
where, I guarantee,
you'll learn more about unwanted

1431
01:18:01,259 --> 01:18:03,969
sexual advances than you can
possibly imagine.

1432
01:18:04,888 --> 01:18:07,431
Do you think this is
going to intimidate me?

1433
01:18:07,557 --> 01:18:09,892
Even if this evidence
was credible, who are you going to get

1434
01:18:10,018 --> 01:18:12,895
to prosecute a small-time witness
tampering charge, huh?

1435
01:18:14,272 --> 01:18:16,399
Harvey, didn't you
graduate law school

1436
01:18:16,525 --> 01:18:19,110
with the current
U.S. Attorney in New York?

1437
01:18:19,236 --> 01:18:20,569
In fact, I did.

1438
01:18:20,696 --> 01:18:23,572
And I think he might even be interested
in pursuing a case like this.

1439
01:18:23,699 --> 01:18:24,865
Wait, are you
two still close?

1440
01:18:24,991 --> 01:18:26,450
Well, I was the best man
at his wedding.

1441
01:18:26,576 --> 01:18:27,535
Wow.

1442
01:18:27,661 --> 01:18:29,370
No, you weren't.
You're bluffing.

1443
01:18:29,663 --> 01:18:33,916
No. I think I've got some pictures of us
at the ceremony.

1444
01:18:35,627 --> 01:18:37,086
Let's see.

1445
01:18:37,713 --> 01:18:39,588
Yeah. Here we are.

1446
01:18:40,090 --> 01:18:42,633
I must admit,
I look very dashing.

1447
01:18:42,759 --> 01:18:45,010
This is me and his mother.
The woman adores me.

1448
01:18:45,470 --> 01:18:46,971
Here we are at
his bachelor party.

1449
01:18:47,097 --> 01:18:49,432
There's no strippers.
He's lame.

1450
01:18:49,725 --> 01:18:52,143
But he can't put guys like you away
for sexual harassment

1451
01:18:52,269 --> 01:18:53,936
and then go to strip
clubs now, can he?

1452
01:18:54,062 --> 01:18:55,438
All right,
what do you want?

1453
01:18:55,814 --> 01:18:57,440
An admission of guilt

1454
01:18:57,566 --> 01:19:00,943
and a guarantee that you'll obtain
treatment before working again.

1455
01:19:02,988 --> 01:19:05,364
And Nancy gets
reinstated with back pay.

1456
01:19:06,116 --> 01:19:07,116
Fine.

1457
01:19:07,492 --> 01:19:11,370
- And a raise.
- Okay. All right. Are we done?

1458
01:19:11,496 --> 01:19:13,497
The kid should be able to grow up
without the burden

1459
01:19:13,623 --> 01:19:15,207
of tuition hanging over his head.
Don't you think?

1460
01:19:15,333 --> 01:19:19,170
Which is why you're also going to pay
Nancy an extra $250,000.

1461
01:19:19,296 --> 01:19:20,546
Charles.

1462
01:19:24,384 --> 01:19:26,051
Gentlemen.

1463
01:19:46,823 --> 01:19:49,200
Thank you for everything.

1464
01:19:50,035 --> 01:19:51,285
You're welcome.

1465
01:19:58,585 --> 01:20:00,211
Not bad.

1466
01:20:00,712 --> 01:20:01,879
Well done.

1467
01:20:02,756 --> 01:20:05,800
Okay, so just one question.
Why did you go to Joanna's house?

1468
01:20:05,926 --> 01:20:07,927
Because I figured it out.

1469
01:20:08,053 --> 01:20:11,013
I object. I think you
did it because you care.

1470
01:20:11,139 --> 01:20:12,556
I did it because
it's my job.

1471
01:20:12,849 --> 01:20:14,975
Would you admit it?
You care about me.

1472
01:20:15,101 --> 01:20:17,228
I saw you smile when I showed up
for work this morning.

1473
01:20:17,354 --> 01:20:20,064
I didn't smile. I was thinking
of a funny joke.

1474
01:20:21,650 --> 01:20:23,859
Look, we start
on this tomorrow.

1475
01:20:23,985 --> 01:20:25,611
Does this mean
we're officially a team now?

1476
01:20:25,737 --> 01:20:27,655
I wouldn't move your things into
Wayne Manor just yet.

1477
01:20:27,948 --> 01:20:29,615
So, now you're Batman.

1478
01:20:29,741 --> 01:20:31,867
Closer to him
than Clemenza.

1479
01:20:31,993 --> 01:20:33,452
Oh, yeah. Kilmer.

1480
01:20:33,578 --> 01:20:34,829
Clooney.

1481
01:20:35,330 --> 01:20:36,372
Keaton.

1482
01:20:37,874 --> 01:20:39,792
Did you really quit when you
first started?

1483
01:20:39,918 --> 01:20:41,377
Of course not.
I'm not a wuss.
