1
00:00:13,477 --> 00:00:16,779
Hello?

2
00:00:16,847 --> 00:00:20,483
I am armed...

3
00:00:20,551 --> 00:00:24,754
with a... with a big gun.

4
00:00:24,822 --> 00:00:26,522
Oh, my...

5
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:28,658
- Oh, m...
- God.

6
00:00:28,726 --> 00:00:32,795
At least do it with
a little authority.

7
00:00:32,863 --> 00:00:35,164
Someone's going to think
I raised a pussy.

8
00:00:35,232 --> 00:00:37,967
You scared the crap out of me.

9
00:00:38,035 --> 00:00:39,202
How did you get here?

10
00:00:39,269 --> 00:00:41,904
I live in a nursing home,
not a prison.

11
00:00:41,972 --> 00:00:44,073
They have a shuttle service

12
00:00:44,141 --> 00:00:46,943
and a very muscular driver
named Donald.

13
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:48,811
Grammy, I'm making
a lot of money right now.

14
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:50,079
I could have sent
a car for you.

15
00:00:50,147 --> 00:00:51,347
Then, I wouldn't have gotten

16
00:00:51,415 --> 00:00:54,817
to see a very muscular driver
named Donald.

17
00:00:54,885 --> 00:00:58,955
Why didn't you call?
I could have been here.

18
00:01:01,792 --> 00:01:06,195
Oh, my God.

19
00:01:06,263 --> 00:01:09,866
Our dinner.

20
00:01:09,933 --> 00:01:13,936
I have been working so hard,
I forgot what day it is.

21
00:01:16,373 --> 00:01:20,376
That used to happen to dad.

22
00:01:20,444 --> 00:01:25,481
That's what happens when
you care about your job.

23
00:01:25,549 --> 00:01:28,751
And don't give a rat's ass
about your grandmother.

24
00:01:28,819 --> 00:01:31,821
Well, yeah, that is why
I put you in the home.

25
00:01:36,059 --> 00:01:37,894
Good morning, everyone.

26
00:01:37,961 --> 00:01:40,496
Before we get down to business,
I would like to offer

27
00:01:40,564 --> 00:01:46,502
a big welcome back
to Daniel Hardman.

28
00:01:47,571 --> 00:01:48,871
We're thrilled to have you home.

29
00:01:48,939 --> 00:01:50,406
- Now, moving on...
- I'm sorry, Jessica.

30
00:01:50,474 --> 00:01:52,241
Before you do that,
I want to say one thing.

31
00:01:52,309 --> 00:01:54,277
While I am delighted
to be back,

32
00:01:54,344 --> 00:01:55,845
I want to be clear.
Nothing's changing.

33
00:01:55,913 --> 00:01:57,580
Jessica is still the head
of this firm.

34
00:01:57,648 --> 00:02:00,183
I'm here in
a number two capacity.

35
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:03,553
Just think of me like
a seasoned advisor.

36
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:06,322
Like Bill to Hillary
if she'd won.

37
00:02:07,524 --> 00:02:10,960
Thank you, Daniel. Moving on.

38
00:02:11,028 --> 00:02:15,164
Prescott hospitals' negotiation
with their nurses' union.

39
00:02:15,232 --> 00:02:17,133
Nobody wants a strike.

40
00:02:17,201 --> 00:02:18,868
I'm going to need someone
who's going to bring this home.

41
00:02:18,936 --> 00:02:20,203
Therefore...
Not to jump in here too quick,

42
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:22,238
but I did bring Prescott
into the firm.

43
00:02:22,306 --> 00:02:23,973
I'm your man.

44
00:02:24,041 --> 00:02:25,842
What I was going to say is
I brought Harvey up to speed

45
00:02:25,909 --> 00:02:27,343
on this last night.

46
00:02:27,411 --> 00:02:29,245
He's got it covered.
Been prepping all morning.

47
00:02:29,313 --> 00:02:30,980
Really? The whole morning?

48
00:02:31,048 --> 00:02:32,615
I learn fast.

49
00:02:32,683 --> 00:02:33,616
Maybe I could still help.
Mind if I take a look?

50
00:02:33,684 --> 00:02:35,017
Later.

51
00:02:35,085 --> 00:02:37,253
Jessica likes to keep
these meetings headlines only.

52
00:02:37,321 --> 00:02:38,621
I'll swing by your office.

53
00:02:38,689 --> 00:02:42,358
- Sounds like a plan.
- Next order of business.

54
00:02:45,329 --> 00:02:47,263
Nurses' strike assigned
to me last night?

55
00:02:47,331 --> 00:02:49,432
Goddamn Daniel.

56
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,833
Picked up right
where he left off.

57
00:02:50,901 --> 00:02:53,736
Trying to cut my legs out.

58
00:02:53,804 --> 00:02:54,837
Why are you grinning?

59
00:02:54,905 --> 00:02:56,072
I'm just glad to have someone

60
00:02:56,139 --> 00:02:58,307
in the room who pisses you off
more than I do.

61
00:02:58,375 --> 00:02:59,575
You know why I picked you,
right?

62
00:02:59,643 --> 00:03:00,943
Because you knew
I'd roll with your lie.

63
00:03:01,011 --> 00:03:04,146
Because you need a chance to
get out of the doghouse.

64
00:03:04,214 --> 00:03:06,315
I got your tea service for you.

65
00:03:06,383 --> 00:03:07,750
You think that's going
to cut it?

66
00:03:07,818 --> 00:03:10,920
- What do you want me to do?
- Put him in his place.

67
00:03:13,891 --> 00:03:15,658
Ahh! It's a can opener. What?

68
00:03:15,726 --> 00:03:17,193
Paying for your sins
of last night?

69
00:03:19,029 --> 00:03:21,097
I wish you hadn't said that.
Why not?

70
00:03:21,164 --> 00:03:22,832
'Cause I spent the night
with my grandmother.

71
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:25,735
- Is she hot?
- What is wrong with you?

72
00:03:25,802 --> 00:03:28,104
- You started it.
- I most certainly did not.

73
00:03:28,171 --> 00:03:29,171
Prescott Hospital.

74
00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:30,206
I need a complete summary

75
00:03:30,274 --> 00:03:32,308
of their nurses'
union negotiation.

76
00:03:32,376 --> 00:03:35,311
From whom?

77
00:03:37,147 --> 00:03:38,080
Rachel?

78
00:03:38,148 --> 00:03:40,249
No. No, it's too soon. I...

79
00:03:40,317 --> 00:03:42,318
I broke it off
before we even started. No.

80
00:03:42,386 --> 00:03:43,419
Tell her about
the exciting night

81
00:03:43,487 --> 00:03:44,820
you spent with
your grandmother.

82
00:03:44,888 --> 00:03:45,955
Trust me.

83
00:03:46,023 --> 00:03:47,323
She'll realize she dodged
a bullet.

84
00:03:47,391 --> 00:03:48,724
Oh.

85
00:03:48,792 --> 00:03:50,893
And I need four bullshit
pro bono cases right now.

86
00:03:50,961 --> 00:03:52,895
I don't have
any pro bono files.

87
00:03:52,963 --> 00:03:57,233
I'm a corporate lawyer.
That's what we do here.

88
00:03:59,703 --> 00:04:00,903
I do it on my own time.

89
00:04:00,971 --> 00:04:03,372
- Thanks, Rachel.
- Wait a minute.

90
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,908
Why are you asking me
for case files?

91
00:04:05,976 --> 00:04:07,810
I'm not allowed to say.

92
00:04:07,878 --> 00:04:09,645
Harvey asked Mike,
and he was too afraid?

93
00:04:09,713 --> 00:04:12,348
Like a baby girl.

94
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:13,649
You okay? No.

95
00:04:13,717 --> 00:04:15,017
But I am too busy
to do anything

96
00:04:15,085 --> 00:04:16,052
other than throw myself

97
00:04:16,119 --> 00:04:17,520
into this stack of work anyhow.

98
00:04:17,588 --> 00:04:18,621
Well...

99
00:04:18,689 --> 00:04:20,456
as long as you're making
healthy choices.

100
00:04:20,524 --> 00:04:22,892
Yeah.

101
00:04:25,095 --> 00:04:26,262
Make yourself at home.

102
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:28,397
You know, I can see myself
in this thing.

103
00:04:28,465 --> 00:04:31,534
I would find that really
distracting, of course.

104
00:04:31,602 --> 00:04:33,302
I'm swooning.

105
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:35,838
I thought the plan was to meet
in your office.

106
00:04:35,906 --> 00:04:39,175
I thought I'd save us
some time.

107
00:04:39,242 --> 00:04:40,643
This is a child custody
dispute.

108
00:04:40,711 --> 00:04:42,745
Little Lenny. So sad.

109
00:04:42,813 --> 00:04:44,513
You need props to
make your point?

110
00:04:44,581 --> 00:04:45,748
You said you changed.

111
00:04:45,816 --> 00:04:47,683
Why don't you prove it
by doing some good?

112
00:04:47,751 --> 00:04:49,151
Harvey, I have changed.

113
00:04:49,219 --> 00:04:52,421
But I don't have to prove
anything to you.

114
00:04:52,489 --> 00:04:54,957
Not as long as
you sit in this office

115
00:04:55,025 --> 00:04:56,726
and pretend to practice law.

116
00:04:56,793 --> 00:04:58,961
But when you stick your nose
in my cases,

117
00:04:59,029 --> 00:05:00,463
that's another story.

118
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:02,865
If you haven't noticed,
my name is on the door.

119
00:05:02,933 --> 00:05:04,266
They're all my cases.

120
00:05:04,334 --> 00:05:06,369
The name of this firm is
Pearson Hardman.

121
00:05:06,436 --> 00:05:07,970
You said it yourself,
you're number two.

122
00:05:08,038 --> 00:05:09,372
I answer to number one.

123
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:10,973
No matter who you answer to,

124
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:13,109
one way or another,

125
00:05:13,176 --> 00:05:16,445
you will learn to treat me
with respect.

126
00:05:16,513 --> 00:05:19,148
Fine.

127
00:05:19,216 --> 00:05:22,351
I respect you,
but I don't work for you.

128
00:05:22,419 --> 00:05:24,387
And I sure as hell
don't work <i>with</i> you.

129
00:05:24,454 --> 00:05:27,523
Pick up the phone.

140
00:06:10,998 --> 00:06:12,832
isn't a lawyer but a nurse,
right?

141
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,000
What's your point?

142
00:06:14,068 --> 00:06:15,869
What if you get schooled
by a hot nurse?

143
00:06:15,936 --> 00:06:17,270
What are you, 12?

144
00:06:17,338 --> 00:06:18,771
What, you can talk about
my grandmother,

145
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:21,441
but I can't make a nurse joke?
Yup.

146
00:06:21,508 --> 00:06:22,609
Actually, I was 12

147
00:06:22,676 --> 00:06:24,210
when I had my first
caregiver fantasy.

148
00:06:24,278 --> 00:06:25,645
Let me guess. Nurse Ratched.

149
00:06:25,713 --> 00:06:26,746
Say what you will.

150
00:06:26,814 --> 00:06:28,047
You had a kind
of stocky hotness.

151
00:06:28,115 --> 00:06:30,149
Listen, our goal
is to reach a fair agreement

152
00:06:30,217 --> 00:06:31,618
between a hospital
and its nurses.

153
00:06:31,685 --> 00:06:32,952
There are no winners.

154
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:35,655
Did you have a stroke?
There's always a winner.

155
00:06:35,723 --> 00:06:37,690
Of course there's a winner.

156
00:06:37,758 --> 00:06:38,892
Just needed to make sure

157
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:41,261
you were ready to stick it
to the nurses.

158
00:06:41,328 --> 00:06:43,363
Don't say it.

159
00:06:45,933 --> 00:06:49,802
Ah. Negotiator number five.

160
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:52,805
Meet the new boss.
Same as the old boss.

161
00:06:52,873 --> 00:06:55,408
Jameson was our last
negotiator. Trust me.

162
00:06:55,476 --> 00:06:56,743
I'm not Jameson.

163
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:58,077
That's what he said about
the one before him.

164
00:06:58,145 --> 00:06:59,512
You're all the same to me.

165
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:01,948
I'm over here,
you're over here.

166
00:07:02,016 --> 00:07:04,651
Well, let's see if we can't...

167
00:07:04,718 --> 00:07:07,687
You're going to have
to buy me dinner first.

168
00:07:07,755 --> 00:07:09,455
I can do better.

169
00:07:09,523 --> 00:07:11,524
You're expecting me
to offer you this.

170
00:07:11,592 --> 00:07:13,760
You're willing to settle
on this.

171
00:07:13,827 --> 00:07:14,861
You're praying for this.

172
00:07:14,929 --> 00:07:19,499
Well, your prayers have
been answered.

173
00:07:19,566 --> 00:07:21,768
You know, I'll even buy you
breakfast in the morning.

174
00:07:21,835 --> 00:07:23,503
Not so fast, blondie.

175
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:26,606
Prescott Hospitals is hurting
as much as anyone else.

176
00:07:26,674 --> 00:07:27,974
You push any harder,

177
00:07:28,042 --> 00:07:29,842
they're going to go out
of business, and nobody wins.

178
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:31,244
This is the best
you're going to do.

179
00:07:31,312 --> 00:07:35,415
And it's a deal
you're ready to take.

180
00:07:35,482 --> 00:07:36,883
We <i>were</i> ready.

181
00:07:36,951 --> 00:07:40,053
But what about the new account
you funded yesterday?

182
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,721
Yeah, that's right.
I know about it.

183
00:07:41,789 --> 00:07:43,389
This isn't my first rodeo.

184
00:07:43,457 --> 00:07:45,558
Then you also know that
money's off the table.

185
00:07:45,626 --> 00:07:47,794
Money's fungible.
Everything's on the table.

186
00:07:47,861 --> 00:07:49,262
I'm sorry,

187
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:51,531
but that account was funded
by donors specifically

188
00:07:51,598 --> 00:07:53,733
for the development
of new robotics for surgery.

189
00:07:53,801 --> 00:07:56,469
I used to change bedpans
for a living, junior.

190
00:07:56,537 --> 00:07:58,738
I know what bullshit
smells like.

191
00:07:58,806 --> 00:07:59,806
This isn't bullshit.

192
00:07:59,873 --> 00:08:00,873
Even if Prescott wanted

193
00:08:00,941 --> 00:08:02,642
to give that money
to the nurses,

194
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:05,078
they couldn't, legally.

195
00:08:05,145 --> 00:08:06,079
So they're willing
to raise money

196
00:08:06,146 --> 00:08:07,580
for equipment but not nurses?

197
00:08:07,648 --> 00:08:08,815
I get it.

198
00:08:08,882 --> 00:08:12,318
Nurses are sexy,
but nurses aren't sexy.

199
00:08:12,386 --> 00:08:14,854
Well, you need to find a way
to get us access to that money,

200
00:08:14,922 --> 00:08:17,090
or we don't have a deal.

201
00:08:17,157 --> 00:08:18,491
That's not going to happen.

202
00:08:18,559 --> 00:08:19,692
Well, then we're done.

203
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:22,762
You leave this table,
it means only one thing.

204
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:24,764
I know exactly what it means.

205
00:08:24,832 --> 00:08:26,966
We have
a fully funded strike fund,

206
00:08:27,034 --> 00:08:28,701
and we're going to use it.

207
00:08:28,769 --> 00:08:31,704
We reject your proposal.

208
00:08:37,011 --> 00:08:41,614
Reminder: Ask Harold
to dye his hair.

209
00:08:41,682 --> 00:08:43,116
Orange is the color of a clown.

210
00:08:43,183 --> 00:08:45,752
No, strike that.
Harold is a clown.

211
00:08:50,157 --> 00:08:52,358
Annual survey
of associates came out.

212
00:08:52,426 --> 00:08:55,595
Pearson Hardman ranked second
to last in quality of life.

213
00:08:55,662 --> 00:08:57,630
Who beat us?

214
00:08:57,698 --> 00:08:58,831
Louis, I know you
take great pride

215
00:08:58,899 --> 00:09:00,800
in making the associates' lives
miserable...

216
00:09:00,868 --> 00:09:03,136
Well, I did until the survey
said I was second best at it.

217
00:09:03,203 --> 00:09:04,137
You're missing the point.

218
00:09:04,204 --> 00:09:05,738
Harvard wants to rescind

219
00:09:05,806 --> 00:09:08,341
our on-campus
recruiting privileges.

220
00:09:08,409 --> 00:09:10,510
What?

221
00:09:10,577 --> 00:09:14,113
Wait.
Pearson Hardman is Harvard.

222
00:09:14,181 --> 00:09:15,948
Harvard is Pearson Hardman.

223
00:09:16,016 --> 00:09:18,217
One can't survive
without the other.

224
00:09:18,285 --> 00:09:19,619
There's no need
for histrionics just yet.

225
00:09:19,686 --> 00:09:21,754
Histrionics?

226
00:09:21,822 --> 00:09:23,322
This is the gravest day
I've ever known.

227
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:27,093
Jessica, let me handle this.

228
00:09:27,161 --> 00:09:30,129
Why do you think I'm here?

229
00:09:30,197 --> 00:09:31,631
Screw you.

230
00:09:31,698 --> 00:09:35,268
Mine likes to be scolded too.

231
00:09:35,335 --> 00:09:36,736
I keep getting
these dating site pop-ups.

232
00:09:36,804 --> 00:09:39,605
It's like my computer's
accusing me of being single.

233
00:09:39,673 --> 00:09:41,340
Do you know
why it's doing that?

234
00:09:41,408 --> 00:09:42,542
My mother's in there?

235
00:09:42,609 --> 00:09:43,743
Did you search for
a dating site?

236
00:09:43,811 --> 00:09:45,278
- No.
- When?

237
00:09:45,345 --> 00:09:46,979
Last week.

238
00:09:47,047 --> 00:09:50,249
You, me, happy hour,
Harvey's corporate card.

239
00:09:50,317 --> 00:09:51,350
Are you crazy?

240
00:09:51,418 --> 00:09:52,718
You want to leave the office
at 5:00?

241
00:09:52,786 --> 00:09:53,986
Oh, don't be ridiculous.

242
00:09:54,054 --> 00:09:57,156
Happy hour starts at 4:00.

243
00:09:57,224 --> 00:09:58,491
It's a bad idea.

244
00:09:58,559 --> 00:09:59,559
You're never going to get
an injunction to stop

245
00:09:59,626 --> 00:10:00,893
the strike outright.

246
00:10:00,961 --> 00:10:02,195
You read that in a book,

247
00:10:02,262 --> 00:10:03,396
or is that what
your five minutes

248
00:10:03,464 --> 00:10:04,697
practicing law have to say?

249
00:10:04,765 --> 00:10:06,632
Not a book
but every labor decision

250
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,101
from the last ten years.

251
00:10:08,168 --> 00:10:10,136
But I'm telling you,
it's a safer bet

252
00:10:10,204 --> 00:10:11,804
arguing for the temporary
restraining order.

253
00:10:11,872 --> 00:10:14,273
First of all,
a T.R.O. delays a strike,

254
00:10:14,341 --> 00:10:16,409
an injunction stops it,
and I want to stop it.

255
00:10:16,477 --> 00:10:17,743
Second of all...

256
00:10:17,811 --> 00:10:19,479
never use that phrase
"safer bet" with me again.

257
00:10:20,881 --> 00:10:23,116
- Safer bet.
- You know what?

258
00:10:23,183 --> 00:10:26,052
You don't deserve the privilege
of seeing me win.

259
00:10:28,789 --> 00:10:31,190
I've gathered you all here
to ask you

260
00:10:31,258 --> 00:10:33,359
just one simple question.

261
00:10:33,427 --> 00:10:35,294
Do any of you have the desire

262
00:10:35,362 --> 00:10:39,298
to strip down and exchange
underwear with each other?

263
00:10:39,366 --> 00:10:41,200
Any takers?

264
00:10:41,268 --> 00:10:42,435
No?

265
00:10:42,503 --> 00:10:43,736
Well, of course not
because you don't want

266
00:10:43,804 --> 00:10:45,872
to air your dirty laundry
in public, right?

267
00:10:45,939 --> 00:10:48,508
But evidently, you did.

268
00:10:48,575 --> 00:10:50,610
And while I'm personally proud
of the fact

269
00:10:50,677 --> 00:10:53,212
that you're all unhappy,
Harvard is not.

270
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,982
So I've invited a representative
from the law school

271
00:10:56,049 --> 00:10:58,885
to see firsthand
how joyful you all are

272
00:10:58,952 --> 00:11:00,219
under my tutelage.

273
00:11:00,287 --> 00:11:02,989
So you want us to lie?

274
00:11:03,056 --> 00:11:05,124
No.

275
00:11:05,192 --> 00:11:06,959
I want you to convince
this woman

276
00:11:07,027 --> 00:11:12,365
that Pearson Hardman makes you
shit rainbows.

277
00:11:12,432 --> 00:11:14,333
Is that clear? Yeah.

278
00:11:14,401 --> 00:11:16,602
- You sure? Okay.
- Yeah.

279
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:21,507
Anyone else have
any other stupid questions?

280
00:11:38,592 --> 00:11:40,193
What are you doing here?

281
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:42,428
I'm here on behalf
of Pearson Hardman.

282
00:11:42,496 --> 00:11:44,330
As much as I appreciate
a fan club,

283
00:11:44,398 --> 00:11:45,865
this hearing starts
in five minutes,

284
00:11:45,933 --> 00:11:47,300
which means you've got four
minutes to get out of here.

285
00:11:47,367 --> 00:11:48,801
Daniel.

286
00:11:48,869 --> 00:11:51,470
I'm prepared to rule on
your motion.

287
00:11:51,538 --> 00:11:54,507
What do you think
it's going to be?

288
00:11:54,575 --> 00:11:57,076
T.R.O. granted.

289
00:11:57,144 --> 00:11:58,377
Finally, you rule one for me.

290
00:11:58,445 --> 00:12:00,479
Don't give me any grief
about the Feinberg suit.

291
00:12:00,547 --> 00:12:04,150
Your precedents sucked.
This one's legit.

292
00:12:04,218 --> 00:12:05,818
It's good to
have you back, Daniel.

293
00:12:05,886 --> 00:12:10,022
Thank you for moving me up
on the docket, Judge.

294
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:18,798
- What the hell was that?
- I believe it was a victory.

295
00:12:18,865 --> 00:12:20,933
Hey, you don't reschedule
my hearings.

296
00:12:21,001 --> 00:12:22,435
Were you in there?

297
00:12:22,502 --> 00:12:24,036
'Cause I do.

298
00:12:24,104 --> 00:12:25,338
The truth is
you should be thanking me.

299
00:12:25,405 --> 00:12:26,405
Well, would you like me

300
00:12:26,473 --> 00:12:27,740
to thank your face
with my fist?

301
00:12:27,808 --> 00:12:29,709
If you would have consulted
with me first,

302
00:12:29,776 --> 00:12:31,944
like I offered,
I could have told you.

303
00:12:32,012 --> 00:12:35,414
Garvin Steiner was never going
to grant an injunction.

304
00:12:35,482 --> 00:12:36,549
Not when his Wednesday
golf buddy shows up

305
00:12:36,617 --> 00:12:38,117
and hijacks the courtroom.

306
00:12:38,185 --> 00:12:39,452
Say what you will.
I know the man.

307
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:41,153
0% chance he gives you
what you want.

308
00:12:41,221 --> 00:12:42,755
Daniel, maybe you don't know

309
00:12:42,823 --> 00:12:44,123
how it works these days.

310
00:12:44,191 --> 00:12:45,424
When I'm on a case,

311
00:12:45,492 --> 00:12:47,293
the only thing
there's 0% chance of

312
00:12:47,361 --> 00:12:48,628
is me losing.

313
00:12:48,695 --> 00:12:50,896
Harvey, I said I've changed.

314
00:12:50,964 --> 00:12:53,199
Don't mistake that change
for weakness.

315
00:12:53,267 --> 00:12:55,067
I told you,
my name's on the door.

316
00:12:55,135 --> 00:12:58,471
Didn't get there by me taking
shit from the likes of you.

317
00:12:58,538 --> 00:12:59,972
You want to work together
on this,

318
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,474
I'm open to it.

319
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:02,642
You don't,

320
00:13:02,709 --> 00:13:04,477
this is how it's going to be.

321
00:13:17,245 --> 00:13:19,013
So let me get this straight.

322
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:21,615
The judge ruled
against your idea,

323
00:13:21,683 --> 00:13:22,750
and so you went with my idea?

324
00:13:22,817 --> 00:13:25,619
Not exactly.
Hardman got the T.R.O.

325
00:13:25,687 --> 00:13:28,255
Okay, so you told me
I was wrong,

326
00:13:28,323 --> 00:13:31,158
and yet I had the same idea
as a managing partner.

327
00:13:31,226 --> 00:13:32,726
That's funny, that kind of
makes me wonder

328
00:13:32,794 --> 00:13:33,827
what else you've been
wrong about.

329
00:13:33,895 --> 00:13:35,029
Hiring you?

330
00:13:35,096 --> 00:13:37,464
Daniel and I wouldn't
concur with that.

331
00:13:37,532 --> 00:13:38,599
Hey, handsome.

332
00:13:38,667 --> 00:13:41,435
Your bearded buddy
was already here.

333
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:43,804
You can shut us down
for 48 hours,

334
00:13:43,872 --> 00:13:45,673
but we can still prepare
to strike.

335
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:49,944
Actually, I came over
to extend an olive branch.

336
00:13:50,011 --> 00:13:52,079
Why don't you go ahead and
start your strike right now?

337
00:13:52,147 --> 00:13:54,782
You looked into our finances,
I looked into yours.

338
00:13:54,849 --> 00:13:56,817
Your strike fund has enough
to last a week.

339
00:13:56,885 --> 00:13:59,153
We're not even going to have
a meeting about it for a month.

340
00:13:59,221 --> 00:14:00,788
We know what
we're getting into.

341
00:14:00,855 --> 00:14:02,590
We're prepared.

342
00:14:02,657 --> 00:14:03,691
Well, prepare yourself
for this:

343
00:14:03,758 --> 00:14:05,659
Our last offer's off the table.

344
00:14:05,727 --> 00:14:08,295
The new offer is the one
we gave you before that.

345
00:14:08,363 --> 00:14:09,463
And every day you strike,

346
00:14:09,531 --> 00:14:13,634
it's going
to keep getting worse.

347
00:14:13,702 --> 00:14:15,336
Harvey, you do realize
you just littered, right?

348
00:14:15,403 --> 00:14:17,638
They can pick it up.
They're not working.

349
00:14:17,706 --> 00:14:19,306
It'll give them
a sense of purpose.

350
00:14:19,374 --> 00:14:20,574
Wow.

351
00:14:20,642 --> 00:14:22,409
You don't think you're being
a little harsh?

352
00:14:22,477 --> 00:14:24,011
I just put an end
to a situation

353
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:27,081
our client can't afford
and those nurses can't either.

354
00:14:27,148 --> 00:14:29,149
Trust me, they'll cave.

355
00:14:31,253 --> 00:14:32,953
Everyone.

356
00:14:33,021 --> 00:14:34,321
I would like you to meet.

357
00:14:34,389 --> 00:14:37,591
Ms. Sheila Zass from
our beloved Harvard Law.

358
00:14:37,659 --> 00:14:39,994
While I appreciate
the introduction,

359
00:14:40,061 --> 00:14:41,061
I would have appreciated
even more

360
00:14:41,129 --> 00:14:42,529
a little discretion.

361
00:14:42,597 --> 00:14:44,465
I'm here to make an assessment,

362
00:14:44,532 --> 00:14:46,433
which would have been aided
by anonymity.

363
00:14:46,501 --> 00:14:48,002
Fly. Wall.

364
00:14:48,069 --> 00:14:49,069
Loud and clear.

365
00:14:49,137 --> 00:14:50,070
And by the way,

366
00:14:50,138 --> 00:14:52,706
it's Sazs. S-a-z-s.

367
00:14:52,774 --> 00:14:54,842
Yeah, that's what I said.
Sheila Zass.

368
00:14:54,909 --> 00:14:56,343
Never mind.

369
00:14:56,411 --> 00:14:57,678
Do you see what I see?

370
00:14:57,746 --> 00:14:59,046
There's two of them.

371
00:14:59,114 --> 00:15:02,316
I think Louis is attracted
to female Louis.

372
00:15:02,384 --> 00:15:03,384
Do you think that
if they touch,

373
00:15:03,451 --> 00:15:04,585
the world would cease to exist?

374
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:06,253
I don't want to think
about them touching.

375
00:15:06,321 --> 00:15:07,254
There's my favorite
litigation girl.

376
00:15:07,322 --> 00:15:08,422
Olivia, what's up?

377
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:10,858
James, Gordon brief,
just going to say,

378
00:15:10,925 --> 00:15:12,026
it was a gift to the law.

379
00:15:12,093 --> 00:15:13,594
See, this is what I like to do,
basically.

380
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:14,728
I like to, uh, you know,
sit here

381
00:15:14,796 --> 00:15:16,096
once a week,
make myself accessible,

382
00:15:16,164 --> 00:15:17,197
get to know the troops

383
00:15:17,265 --> 00:15:19,233
on a, you know, personal level.
Okay.

384
00:15:19,301 --> 00:15:22,703
And what has
that process yielded?

385
00:15:22,771 --> 00:15:25,773
Well, Harold has a mother...

386
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,474
Aunt.

387
00:15:27,542 --> 00:15:29,543
Who tragically died
of heart disease.

388
00:15:29,611 --> 00:15:30,744
Cancer.

389
00:15:30,812 --> 00:15:33,747
We're all with him.

390
00:15:33,815 --> 00:15:35,082
I think I've seen enough.

391
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:38,118
Clearly, you don't know
that person very well.

392
00:15:38,186 --> 00:15:39,119
So unless you want
to find yourself

393
00:15:39,187 --> 00:15:41,188
recruiting SUNY Binghamton,

394
00:15:41,256 --> 00:15:43,457
you'll treat me with
a little more respect.

395
00:15:43,525 --> 00:15:45,059
Wow, you really cut me
to the quick.

396
00:15:45,126 --> 00:15:47,695
Yes, I do not know him
on a personal level, thank God.

397
00:15:47,762 --> 00:15:50,497
But I don't think
that's relevant.

398
00:15:50,565 --> 00:15:52,199
I have 20 underlings.

399
00:15:52,267 --> 00:15:54,535
I don't know
a single person's last name.

400
00:15:54,602 --> 00:15:56,170
God, I admire you.

401
00:15:56,237 --> 00:15:59,106
What do you need from us
to keep our privileges?

402
00:15:59,174 --> 00:16:00,641
What do you think I need?

403
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:01,642
Talk to each one of them
individually.

404
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:02,643
Bingo. Pick a man.

405
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:05,512
That one.

406
00:16:07,215 --> 00:16:08,882
What the hell
is wrong with you?

407
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:11,452
People say
I'm emotionally unavailable.

408
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,253
I got us 48 hours,
and you threw it away.

409
00:16:13,321 --> 00:16:14,355
No.

410
00:16:14,422 --> 00:16:15,889
You gave them two days
to negotiate

411
00:16:15,957 --> 00:16:18,292
with the threat of a strike
hanging over our heads.

412
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:21,595
I took the only bullet they had
out of the chamber.

413
00:16:21,663 --> 00:16:23,530
And now that bullet
is headed right at us.

414
00:16:23,598 --> 00:16:24,998
They have an offer in front
of them,

415
00:16:25,066 --> 00:16:26,100
and they're going to sign it.

416
00:16:26,167 --> 00:16:27,568
- You don't know that.
- Yes, I do.

417
00:16:27,635 --> 00:16:29,903
Well, you better be right
because if either one of us

418
00:16:29,971 --> 00:16:32,306
picks up the phone right now,
we'll be the ones who caved.

419
00:16:32,374 --> 00:16:33,307
Then we might as well tell them

420
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:34,341
they can have everything.

421
00:16:34,409 --> 00:16:35,709
Finally,
we're on the same page.

422
00:16:35,777 --> 00:16:38,011
Welcome to the team.
We're not on the same page.

423
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:40,247
You backed us into a corner.

424
00:16:40,315 --> 00:16:41,415
I didn't do shit.

425
00:16:41,483 --> 00:16:43,117
Nell Sawyer put us
into that position.

426
00:16:43,184 --> 00:16:45,052
I gave her the best offer
we could afford.

427
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,554
And if this strike drags on,
Prescott goes down.

428
00:16:47,622 --> 00:16:49,690
And none of us can afford that.

429
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:51,225
This strike never
would have happened

430
00:16:51,292 --> 00:16:53,660
in the first place if
I had gotten an injunction

431
00:16:53,728 --> 00:16:54,995
instead of the T.R.O.

432
00:16:55,063 --> 00:16:57,464
By the way,
that piece of genius,

433
00:16:57,532 --> 00:16:59,466
same idea my associate had.

434
00:16:59,534 --> 00:17:01,268
Kid's smart, but he's never
been around the block.

435
00:17:01,336 --> 00:17:03,971
You have.
Stop thinking like a rookie.

436
00:17:09,277 --> 00:17:10,444
Okay, let me guess.

437
00:17:10,512 --> 00:17:12,045
The reason that you haven't
signed up yet

438
00:17:12,113 --> 00:17:13,480
is that you want me to help you

439
00:17:13,548 --> 00:17:15,549
take some sexy pictures
for your profile.

440
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:18,419
You're hoping that one thing
leads to another and...

441
00:17:18,486 --> 00:17:21,054
♪ Bow-chicka bow-wow

442
00:17:21,122 --> 00:17:22,189
No.

443
00:17:22,257 --> 00:17:23,891
The reason I haven't
signed up yet

444
00:17:23,958 --> 00:17:26,360
is because they have
you fill out this form,

445
00:17:26,428 --> 00:17:29,897
and it asks you to write down
who you are.

446
00:17:29,964 --> 00:17:32,266
And who I am is a paralegal.

447
00:17:32,333 --> 00:17:34,468
Rachel, I am a legal secretary,

448
00:17:34,536 --> 00:17:35,602
and I am proud of it.

449
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:36,937
But when somebody asks me
who I am,

450
00:17:37,005 --> 00:17:38,539
that is not the first thing
that comes to mind.

451
00:17:38,606 --> 00:17:40,174
Yeah, but I don't have
anything else, you know?

452
00:17:40,241 --> 00:17:43,177
I kidded myself about becoming
a lawyer,

453
00:17:43,244 --> 00:17:45,412
and I kidded myself about Mike.

454
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:49,616
So the truth is I am just
a lonely paralegal.

455
00:17:49,684 --> 00:17:52,119
And that's a tough thing
to write down.

456
00:17:52,187 --> 00:17:57,491
Well, you're not
a lonely paralegal tonight.

457
00:17:57,559 --> 00:18:00,594
We're lawyers. Pearson Hardman.

458
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:03,964
I'm Harriet Specter,
and this is my associate.

459
00:18:04,032 --> 00:18:06,733
Michelle Ross.
I've got a photographic memory.

460
00:18:06,801 --> 00:18:10,103
Pretty much a legal superhero.

461
00:18:10,171 --> 00:18:11,972
I'm a closer.

462
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:15,042
I'm the best goddamn closer
this town has ever seen.

463
00:18:16,311 --> 00:18:17,377
What are you looking at?

464
00:18:17,445 --> 00:18:19,079
I can recite the constitution

465
00:18:19,147 --> 00:18:20,380
forwards, backwards,
and sideways

466
00:18:20,448 --> 00:18:22,115
'cause I read it once
when I was seven.

467
00:18:22,183 --> 00:18:25,986
I don't buy it.
Recite it right now.

468
00:18:26,054 --> 00:18:27,888
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

469
00:18:27,956 --> 00:18:29,022
I'm a flame thrower.

470
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:30,791
- Surgeon.
- Acrobat.

471
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:32,793
Professor... of law.

472
00:18:32,861 --> 00:18:36,330
I'm a Rabbi.

473
00:18:36,397 --> 00:18:40,234
- Ooh.
- Ooh.

474
00:18:40,301 --> 00:18:41,902
Oh, my God.
What the hell did you order?

475
00:18:50,378 --> 00:18:53,480
Uh, you wanted to see me,
Mr. Hardman?

476
00:18:53,548 --> 00:18:55,415
Please. Call me Daniel.

477
00:18:55,483 --> 00:18:59,419
Sit down.

478
00:18:59,487 --> 00:19:01,922
First of all,
I want to tell you

479
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:03,724
Harvey speaks very highly
of you.

480
00:19:03,791 --> 00:19:05,659
He does?

481
00:19:05,727 --> 00:19:06,827
Well, it's Harvey.

482
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:08,495
So you have to read
between the lines.

483
00:19:08,563 --> 00:19:09,730
What did he say?

484
00:19:09,797 --> 00:19:11,298
That I'm...
I'm not a complete idiot?

485
00:19:11,366 --> 00:19:13,200
Something like that.

486
00:19:13,268 --> 00:19:15,269
He also told me that you and I

487
00:19:15,336 --> 00:19:18,238
had the same idea
to go after a T.R.O.

488
00:19:18,306 --> 00:19:20,274
He told me that too.

489
00:19:20,341 --> 00:19:21,909
Why did you think
it was the right move?

490
00:19:21,976 --> 00:19:24,244
It put a clock
on the negotiations

491
00:19:24,312 --> 00:19:26,446
and kept both sides
at the table.

492
00:19:26,514 --> 00:19:28,081
I thought so too.

493
00:19:28,149 --> 00:19:30,317
But whether I agreed with him

494
00:19:30,385 --> 00:19:32,352
at the time or not,
I'm not going against him now.

495
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:34,354
But he and I do agree
on this point:

496
00:19:34,422 --> 00:19:36,456
His decision puts us in a bit
of a pickle.

497
00:19:36,524 --> 00:19:37,925
Because we can't go back
to Ms. Sawyer

498
00:19:37,992 --> 00:19:40,127
and ask exactly what she needs
to close the deal.

499
00:19:40,194 --> 00:19:42,229
Harvey and I can't.

500
00:19:42,297 --> 00:19:45,032
But I can.

501
00:19:45,099 --> 00:19:48,135
So you are smart.

502
00:19:48,202 --> 00:19:50,637
I'm afraid so.

503
00:19:50,705 --> 00:19:52,005
You'll have to forgive me

504
00:19:52,073 --> 00:19:54,541
for not completely trusting
Harvey's assessment,

505
00:19:54,609 --> 00:19:56,443
but I needed to make sure

506
00:19:56,511 --> 00:19:59,012
that our back channel negotiator
was up to the task.

507
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:01,014
That's why he's not here.

508
00:20:01,082 --> 00:20:05,953
Coach doesn't let dad
come to the tryouts.

509
00:20:08,256 --> 00:20:10,757
What do you need me to do?

510
00:20:15,396 --> 00:20:16,663
They sent you?

511
00:20:16,731 --> 00:20:18,565
Which means they're not serious
about talking.

512
00:20:18,633 --> 00:20:20,701
Ms. Sawyer, please.
Listen to me.

513
00:20:20,768 --> 00:20:22,002
You are on strike,

514
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:23,470
and they are never
going to flinch.

515
00:20:23,538 --> 00:20:25,772
So what harm is there
in talking to me?

516
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,741
Why should I trust you?

517
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:30,677
Well, that's why I wanted you
to meet me here.

518
00:20:30,745 --> 00:20:32,245
Nell,

519
00:20:32,313 --> 00:20:35,215
this is my grandmother,
Edith Ross.

520
00:20:35,283 --> 00:20:36,950
Hello.

521
00:20:37,018 --> 00:20:38,719
A proud resident

522
00:20:38,786 --> 00:20:41,054
of a Prescott nursing home.

523
00:20:41,122 --> 00:20:42,923
This is not just
another case for me.

524
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:44,358
Yeah, and he didn't just
stick me

525
00:20:44,425 --> 00:20:46,059
in here last night
to make that point.

526
00:20:46,127 --> 00:20:47,561
He locked me
in here months ago.

527
00:20:47,629 --> 00:20:49,329
- Grammy.
- Now, easy, Michael.

528
00:20:49,397 --> 00:20:51,264
I'm helping you out here.

529
00:20:51,332 --> 00:20:52,966
By the way,

530
00:20:53,034 --> 00:20:56,336
you're a bit of a hero
to my favorite nurse.

531
00:20:56,404 --> 00:20:59,539
Really?
Well, that's nice to hear.

532
00:20:59,607 --> 00:21:00,741
He never shuts up about you.

533
00:21:00,808 --> 00:21:03,176
I can't take one pill in peace.

534
00:21:04,345 --> 00:21:06,480
Edith, I'm glad

535
00:21:06,547 --> 00:21:08,548
you brought up the topic
of pills

536
00:21:08,616 --> 00:21:11,351
because I need to give
your grandson a little lesson.

537
00:21:11,419 --> 00:21:13,153
You mind? No.

538
00:21:13,221 --> 00:21:14,354
Let's see here.

539
00:21:14,422 --> 00:21:16,323
Plavix, Zestril,

540
00:21:16,391 --> 00:21:18,358
Hygroton, Atenolol.

541
00:21:18,426 --> 00:21:20,661
You know what happens
when they're not kept straight?

542
00:21:20,728 --> 00:21:21,928
Not good.

543
00:21:21,996 --> 00:21:24,464
Who do you think does that?
Doctors?

544
00:21:24,532 --> 00:21:26,033
Nurses.

545
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:28,201
Imagine
your grandmother's nurse

546
00:21:28,269 --> 00:21:30,370
just finished a 15-hour shift.

547
00:21:30,438 --> 00:21:33,607
She needs her medicine
in exactly two hours.

548
00:21:33,675 --> 00:21:35,108
We're understaffed.

549
00:21:35,176 --> 00:21:36,443
That nurse is going to stay.

550
00:21:36,511 --> 00:21:38,412
He won't even sign
a time card for it

551
00:21:38,479 --> 00:21:39,613
because he won't get paid.

552
00:21:39,681 --> 00:21:42,416
But if his name shows up
on this chart,

553
00:21:42,483 --> 00:21:44,951
he stayed.

554
00:21:46,487 --> 00:21:47,721
Happens every day.

555
00:21:47,789 --> 00:21:49,189
You ask me what I want?

556
00:21:49,257 --> 00:21:52,125
I want enough money,
so it never happens again.

557
00:22:01,877 --> 00:22:02,712
That one's a dud.

558
00:22:02,713 --> 00:22:05,848
- You have no idea.
- Mm.

559
00:22:05,915 --> 00:22:07,015
Ms. Sazs.

560
00:22:07,083 --> 00:22:08,049
Mr. Litt.

561
00:22:08,117 --> 00:22:10,151
- Louis.
- Sheila.

562
00:22:10,219 --> 00:22:11,152
I feel as though
I'm talking to a...

563
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:12,153
Kindred spirit?

564
00:22:12,221 --> 00:22:13,154
- Yes.
- I know.

565
00:22:13,222 --> 00:22:14,689
Me too.

566
00:22:14,757 --> 00:22:15,990
Level with me.

567
00:22:16,058 --> 00:22:17,158
I'll be brutally honest.

568
00:22:17,226 --> 00:22:18,526
That's the only language
I speak.

569
00:22:18,594 --> 00:22:19,794
I'm going to allow you
to maintain

570
00:22:19,862 --> 00:22:20,929
your recruiting privileges
because of the man

571
00:22:20,996 --> 00:22:22,430
I believe you to be.

572
00:22:22,498 --> 00:22:24,065
And I believe myself
to be that same man.

573
00:22:24,133 --> 00:22:25,533
But you've got bigger problems.

574
00:22:25,601 --> 00:22:27,602
Your associates
don't respect you.

575
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:32,040
They think you don't work
as hard as they do.

576
00:22:32,108 --> 00:22:33,241
What?

577
00:22:33,309 --> 00:22:35,477
They think you make them
do your work.

578
00:22:38,447 --> 00:22:40,348
You realize
I'm only telling you this

579
00:22:40,416 --> 00:22:42,250
because I think
that they're wrong.

580
00:22:42,318 --> 00:22:45,019
They are wrong.

581
00:22:45,087 --> 00:22:46,888
Now, if you'll excuse me.

582
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:55,563
- I did it.
- Did what?

583
00:22:55,631 --> 00:22:59,234
You and Daniel are going
to be so proud of me.

584
00:22:59,301 --> 00:23:01,102
Why don't you let me be
the judge of that?

585
00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:02,303
Judge all you want.

586
00:23:02,371 --> 00:23:05,140
Judge away because I saw Nell
on my own,

587
00:23:05,207 --> 00:23:08,576
even used my grandmother...
not used.

588
00:23:08,644 --> 00:23:10,645
She was on board with it...
that's weird.

589
00:23:10,713 --> 00:23:12,013
Maintaining your integrity,
I like it.

590
00:23:12,081 --> 00:23:13,081
Continue.

591
00:23:13,149 --> 00:23:14,282
So it turns out

592
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:15,683
that the nurses are consistently
staying late

593
00:23:15,751 --> 00:23:17,152
to give the patients
the right meds

594
00:23:17,219 --> 00:23:18,653
even though they're not
being paid for it.

595
00:23:18,721 --> 00:23:21,189
- And you bought that?
- Yeah, I bought that.

596
00:23:21,257 --> 00:23:23,258
Because I checked
my grandmother's chart.

597
00:23:23,325 --> 00:23:25,160
If it's true for her,
it's true for others.

598
00:23:25,227 --> 00:23:26,628
Oh, you didn't let me finish.

599
00:23:26,695 --> 00:23:28,930
Turns out, that all they want
is enough staff

600
00:23:28,998 --> 00:23:30,165
so that nobody ever has to work

601
00:23:30,232 --> 00:23:31,900
more than
a 15-hour shift again.

602
00:23:31,967 --> 00:23:33,067
And how much is
that going to cost?

603
00:23:33,135 --> 00:23:35,270
10% of the new equipment fund.
Nailed it.

604
00:23:35,337 --> 00:23:36,971
So all we need to do is find

605
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:38,540
a legal way to get
at that money.

606
00:23:38,607 --> 00:23:39,808
Yeah, so do you want me to go

607
00:23:39,875 --> 00:23:41,209
tell Daniel how proud
you are of me,

608
00:23:41,277 --> 00:23:43,011
or do we do that
together later?

609
00:23:43,078 --> 00:23:44,112
Have, like, a group thing?

610
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:46,414
I'll give him the good news.

611
00:23:48,451 --> 00:23:51,119
Wash all you want.
The lies aren't coming off.

612
00:23:51,187 --> 00:23:53,655
I told you I changed.
I didn't say I became a nun.

613
00:23:53,722 --> 00:23:55,757
You lied to my associate.

614
00:23:55,825 --> 00:23:58,293
I never specifically said
anything that wasn't true.

615
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:59,461
People hear what
they want to hear.

616
00:23:59,528 --> 00:24:00,728
You deceived your own.

617
00:24:00,796 --> 00:24:04,132
You never lied
to anyone else here?

618
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,934
Jessica,
the other partners, me?

619
00:24:06,001 --> 00:24:07,969
- Not since you've been back.
- Really?

620
00:24:08,037 --> 00:24:09,804
When did Jessica assign you
this case?

621
00:24:09,872 --> 00:24:12,106
You lied to me.

622
00:24:12,174 --> 00:24:15,143
But I didn't come to
the bathroom and cry about it.

623
00:24:15,211 --> 00:24:16,611
No, you sent my associate
to go crying

624
00:24:16,679 --> 00:24:19,013
to the other side.
So he got us a final number.

625
00:24:19,081 --> 00:24:21,216
He got a number,
but it's not going to be final.

626
00:24:21,283 --> 00:24:22,417
We offer them $10 million,

627
00:24:22,485 --> 00:24:24,285
the next day it's going
to be $15 million.

628
00:24:24,353 --> 00:24:26,321
We needed to hold strong
to get them to close.

629
00:24:26,388 --> 00:24:27,489
Says your gut,

630
00:24:27,556 --> 00:24:29,991
and I don't practice law
based on your gut.

631
00:24:30,059 --> 00:24:31,726
My gut didn't burn through
five negotiators.

632
00:24:31,794 --> 00:24:33,027
Nell Sawyer did.

633
00:24:33,095 --> 00:24:34,762
So you think
we should never budge.

634
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:36,965
I know we should never budge,
but you screwed that

635
00:24:37,032 --> 00:24:38,733
when you sent Mike
to tell them we would.

636
00:24:38,801 --> 00:24:40,134
Congratulations, Daniel.

637
00:24:40,202 --> 00:24:42,103
We may be a couple of liars,

638
00:24:42,171 --> 00:24:43,471
but only one of us is going
to be responsible

639
00:24:43,539 --> 00:24:46,007
when this whole thing goes
to shit.

640
00:24:55,951 --> 00:24:58,887
You wanted to see me?

641
00:25:00,556 --> 00:25:02,190
We'll get going in a minute.

642
00:25:02,258 --> 00:25:04,225
Once I start, I have to finish.

643
00:25:09,198 --> 00:25:11,266
I've always hated these things.

644
00:25:11,333 --> 00:25:13,501
A filthy habit.

645
00:25:13,569 --> 00:25:15,169
My daughter was 15.

646
00:25:15,237 --> 00:25:20,575
I caught her smoking,
and I hit the roof.

647
00:25:20,643 --> 00:25:24,846
But then my wife got sick.

648
00:25:24,914 --> 00:25:27,916
And then when the cancer
got to her lungs,

649
00:25:27,983 --> 00:25:32,954
once a week,
we would share a cigarette.

650
00:25:33,022 --> 00:25:35,623
Give it the finger.

651
00:25:35,691 --> 00:25:40,194
Monday nights at 9:00.

652
00:25:45,067 --> 00:25:48,636
I can't stop.

653
00:25:48,704 --> 00:25:53,875
I don't want to stop.

654
00:25:53,943 --> 00:25:56,177
Uh, we should really
figure out a way

655
00:25:56,245 --> 00:25:57,946
to get at this equipment fund.

656
00:25:58,013 --> 00:25:59,647
It's going to be a long night.

657
00:25:59,715 --> 00:26:00,815
That's okay.

658
00:26:00,883 --> 00:26:02,450
I don't really have much
of a social life.

659
00:26:02,518 --> 00:26:04,619
Me either.

660
00:26:09,458 --> 00:26:12,226
Barbaric.

661
00:26:15,664 --> 00:26:18,466
Norma, the Scofield subpoena
is missing

662
00:26:18,534 --> 00:26:20,735
an entire class
of subcontracts.

663
00:26:20,803 --> 00:26:21,803
Please amend it

664
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:24,939
to include anything after 2010.

665
00:26:25,007 --> 00:26:28,610
Oh, and send Sheila
a basket of flowers.

666
00:26:28,677 --> 00:26:31,412
Thank-you flowers,
not romantic flowers.

667
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:34,015
Let things take
their natural course.

668
00:26:34,083 --> 00:26:35,116
Can't you just keep a diary

669
00:26:35,184 --> 00:26:39,053
like every other
12-year-old girl?

670
00:26:39,121 --> 00:26:40,989
Not tonight, Harvey.

671
00:26:41,056 --> 00:26:44,659
Just go home.

672
00:26:44,727 --> 00:26:47,428
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

673
00:26:47,496 --> 00:26:50,164
I'm just catching up
on some work.

674
00:26:50,232 --> 00:26:54,435
In the bullpen?

675
00:26:54,503 --> 00:26:55,937
Apparently, the associates

676
00:26:56,005 --> 00:26:58,206
don't believe that I work
as hard as they do.

677
00:26:58,273 --> 00:26:59,874
What?

678
00:26:59,942 --> 00:27:01,943
Louis, anyone who doesn't think

679
00:27:02,011 --> 00:27:04,679
you're the hardest-working
lawyer at this firm is an idiot.

680
00:27:04,747 --> 00:27:06,914
You may be a dick,
but as far as I'm concerned,

681
00:27:06,982 --> 00:27:08,549
the associates have it
pretty good.

682
00:27:08,617 --> 00:27:11,085
Thank you, Harvey.

683
00:27:11,153 --> 00:27:15,990
Dick part aside.

684
00:27:16,058 --> 00:27:17,659
Remember when we were in here?

685
00:27:17,726 --> 00:27:19,694
What we had to do?
Like it was yesterday.

686
00:27:19,762 --> 00:27:21,496
I can still hear Hardman
reaming me out

687
00:27:21,563 --> 00:27:23,064
for losing that Dunridge file.

688
00:27:23,132 --> 00:27:25,299
- You were sitting right here.
- I was so scared.

689
00:27:25,367 --> 00:27:28,970
I thought I'd be fired
right on the spot.

690
00:27:30,439 --> 00:27:32,640
- I hid it.
- I knew it! I knew it!

691
00:27:32,708 --> 00:27:35,309
I had to work 48 hours straight
just to recreate it.

692
00:27:35,377 --> 00:27:37,712
Yeah, but we killed it
at trial.

693
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:38,946
Yeah, if that happened now,

694
00:27:39,014 --> 00:27:40,348
I wouldn't hear the end of it.
I know.

695
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:41,783
God forbid they have to pull
one all-nighter,

696
00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:43,084
let alone two.

697
00:27:43,152 --> 00:27:44,519
It's like
they think there's this law

698
00:27:44,586 --> 00:27:45,720
against working more than
20 hours a day.

699
00:27:45,788 --> 00:27:48,022
Well, there isn't.
Prima Donnas.

700
00:27:48,090 --> 00:27:51,859
I should fire them all right now
and start from scratch.

701
00:27:51,927 --> 00:27:53,394
Louis,

702
00:27:53,462 --> 00:27:56,998
I'm only going to say this once,
so you better enjoy it.

703
00:27:57,066 --> 00:28:00,001
You're the man.

704
00:28:14,016 --> 00:28:16,350
You're the man.

705
00:28:21,123 --> 00:28:22,623
You're the man.

706
00:28:27,329 --> 00:28:28,429
Harvey,
did you say somebody's the man?

707
00:28:28,497 --> 00:28:30,231
You're the man.

708
00:28:30,299 --> 00:28:32,300
Thanks. Appreciate it.

709
00:28:32,367 --> 00:28:34,168
Who's the man?

710
00:28:34,236 --> 00:28:35,369
You're the man.

711
00:28:35,437 --> 00:28:36,671
You know it.

712
00:28:36,739 --> 00:28:38,072
What did you say?

713
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:39,373
You're the man.

714
00:28:39,441 --> 00:28:42,376
Damn straight.

715
00:28:55,958 --> 00:28:58,159
What are you doing?

716
00:28:58,227 --> 00:28:59,727
Oh, uh, God.

717
00:28:59,795 --> 00:29:01,929
I'm sorry.
This... this looks awful.

718
00:29:01,997 --> 00:29:04,532
I'm working with Hardman.

719
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:05,633
He needed a file, and I...

720
00:29:05,701 --> 00:29:08,236
Why didn't you just send Donna?

721
00:29:08,303 --> 00:29:10,738
Okay. I deserve that.

722
00:29:12,241 --> 00:29:14,675
Rachel, I swear,
I didn't mean to...

723
00:29:14,743 --> 00:29:15,743
Oh, don't look at me like that.

724
00:29:15,811 --> 00:29:18,746
It's not porn. It's match.com.

725
00:29:18,814 --> 00:29:20,882
- So you're, uh...
- Yeah.

726
00:29:20,949 --> 00:29:22,183
I am. That's good.

727
00:29:22,251 --> 00:29:25,520
- It is.
- I think it's, uh, good.

728
00:29:25,587 --> 00:29:26,721
Yeah, me too.

729
00:29:26,789 --> 00:29:29,257
Except that I have been working

730
00:29:29,324 --> 00:29:31,526
on this essay
for the past three days,

731
00:29:31,593 --> 00:29:34,362
and this is all I've got.

732
00:29:34,429 --> 00:29:37,965
- It's blank.
- I know.

733
00:29:38,033 --> 00:29:41,068
- Okay, how about you start
with something like this:

734
00:29:41,136 --> 00:29:44,138
"I work at the top firm
in Manhattan."

735
00:29:44,206 --> 00:29:45,373
Yeah.

736
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,908
See, that's not really...
"I have an office,

737
00:29:46,975 --> 00:29:48,776
"which is unheard of
for a paralegal.

738
00:29:48,844 --> 00:29:50,211
That shows how much
they value me."

739
00:29:50,279 --> 00:29:51,279
Just hold on.

740
00:29:55,184 --> 00:29:56,717
Okay, more.

741
00:29:58,787 --> 00:30:00,121
"I'm passionate.

742
00:30:00,189 --> 00:30:03,057
"Funny, tenacious.

743
00:30:03,125 --> 00:30:05,726
Courageous."
Any more adjectives?

744
00:30:05,794 --> 00:30:08,796
"Supercalifragilistic-
expialidocious.

745
00:30:08,864 --> 00:30:12,400
I'm incredibly smart,
sometimes aggressively so."

746
00:30:12,467 --> 00:30:14,769
You realize this is supposed
to make me sound good, right?

747
00:30:14,837 --> 00:30:17,572
Why don't you let me finish?

748
00:30:17,639 --> 00:30:20,308
"I'm a...

749
00:30:20,375 --> 00:30:22,476
"I'm also a kind person.

750
00:30:22,544 --> 00:30:25,746
"And I want someone who notices
the little things,

751
00:30:25,814 --> 00:30:28,349
"like... like the fact
that I'm a foodie,

752
00:30:28,417 --> 00:30:31,185
"and I love to share that
with other people.

753
00:30:31,253 --> 00:30:34,989
"Or that when someone pays me
a compliment,

754
00:30:35,057 --> 00:30:36,357
"I can't even look them
in the eye,

755
00:30:36,425 --> 00:30:40,394
"or the fact that my parents
are obviously loaded,

756
00:30:40,462 --> 00:30:46,400
but I'm still determined
to make it on my own."

757
00:30:46,468 --> 00:30:51,405
I'm not going
to type that last part.

758
00:30:53,709 --> 00:30:55,243
Hey, it doesn't matter.

759
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:59,180
You're still going to be beating
them away with a stick.

760
00:30:59,248 --> 00:31:02,416
Well, yeah, because you write
such a... such a good essay.

761
00:31:02,484 --> 00:31:08,256
No, I mean, after you post
a picture here.

762
00:31:32,613 --> 00:31:34,472
Barbinger file, done.

763
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:35,994
Scofield subpoena, done.

764
00:31:36,062 --> 00:31:37,963
Johnson strategy, written.

765
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:40,232
Every single one
of your assignments

766
00:31:40,299 --> 00:31:41,967
was completed by me last night.

767
00:31:42,034 --> 00:31:43,468
What else
do we have left to do?

768
00:31:43,536 --> 00:31:45,170
- Uh, file it?
- Filing.

769
00:31:45,238 --> 00:31:48,140
Doc review, spell check.
Grunt work?

770
00:31:48,207 --> 00:31:51,076
Yes, grunt work.
Because that's your job.

771
00:31:51,144 --> 00:31:52,978
Let it be known that
I can do your work faster

772
00:31:53,045 --> 00:31:55,380
and better than any one of you
without shedding a tear

773
00:31:55,448 --> 00:31:56,948
or breaking a sweat,

774
00:31:57,016 --> 00:31:58,984
but I don't because

775
00:31:59,051 --> 00:32:00,852
writing briefs
and recommending arguments

776
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:03,021
is how you learn.

777
00:32:03,089 --> 00:32:04,756
You go out to any other firm
right now

778
00:32:04,824 --> 00:32:07,192
at this stage of your career,
you won't have this opportunity.

779
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:09,194
If you don't believe me,
I will write you

780
00:32:09,262 --> 00:32:11,630
the best recommendation
you have ever seen,

781
00:32:11,697 --> 00:32:14,466
and you can find out
for yourself.

782
00:32:14,534 --> 00:32:15,667
Go ahead.

783
00:32:15,735 --> 00:32:18,937
Any takers?

784
00:32:19,005 --> 00:32:20,972
That's what I thought.

785
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:23,975
Now I have ten new cases here.

786
00:32:24,043 --> 00:32:27,179
Who wants in?

787
00:32:27,246 --> 00:32:30,615
What are you guys waiting for?
Come and get them.

788
00:32:42,094 --> 00:32:43,495
Excellent work last night,
Mike.

789
00:32:43,563 --> 00:32:46,131
Thanks.

790
00:32:46,199 --> 00:32:48,066
Whoa, you didn't tell me
you were bringing her in.

791
00:32:48,134 --> 00:32:49,568
Who do you think
the proposal was for?

792
00:32:49,635 --> 00:32:50,835
Does Harvey even know about
this meeting?

793
00:32:50,903 --> 00:32:54,272
As a matter of fact, I do.

794
00:33:00,446 --> 00:33:02,681
- What's this?
- It's a pink slip.

795
00:33:02,748 --> 00:33:04,916
50 pink slips, in fact.

796
00:33:04,984 --> 00:33:07,219
For 50 nurses. Excuse me?

797
00:33:07,286 --> 00:33:09,287
It's come to my attention
these nurses have been working

798
00:33:09,355 --> 00:33:10,989
past their 15-hour shift.

799
00:33:11,057 --> 00:33:12,824
And they don't put it
on their time card,

800
00:33:12,892 --> 00:33:14,159
but they still sign charts,

801
00:33:14,227 --> 00:33:15,393
which happens to release them

802
00:33:15,461 --> 00:33:18,096
from the protection
of federal labor law.

803
00:33:18,164 --> 00:33:20,265
You're bluffing.

804
00:33:20,333 --> 00:33:22,267
I found these 50 in one night.

805
00:33:22,335 --> 00:33:26,037
How many do you think
I'll find in a week?

806
00:33:29,575 --> 00:33:31,409
There's a way out of this.

807
00:33:31,477 --> 00:33:33,712
Sign the contract.

808
00:33:35,114 --> 00:33:38,917
Your grandmother
would be proud.

809
00:33:38,985 --> 00:33:42,287
You have until the end
of the day.

810
00:33:46,092 --> 00:33:47,459
- Harvey!
- Let me guess.

811
00:33:47,526 --> 00:33:48,793
You're upset.

812
00:33:48,861 --> 00:33:50,395
I got you that information
through my grandmother.

813
00:33:50,463 --> 00:33:51,896
Your idea, not mine.

814
00:33:51,964 --> 00:33:53,865
Look, I know you might have
been hatched in a pod,

815
00:33:53,933 --> 00:33:55,600
but family actually means
something to me.

816
00:33:55,668 --> 00:33:57,435
And I gave you that information
to help the nurses,

817
00:33:57,503 --> 00:33:58,903
not strong-arm them.

818
00:33:58,971 --> 00:34:00,472
Were you okay with the first
deal we presented to Nell?

819
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:02,607
- That is not the point.
- That's exactly the point.

820
00:34:02,675 --> 00:34:05,510
Because this is a contract that
our client can actually afford.

821
00:34:05,578 --> 00:34:06,945
- Harvey.
- Enough.

822
00:34:07,013 --> 00:34:08,813
You think I was joking when
I asked if you were ready

823
00:34:08,881 --> 00:34:09,848
to stick it to the nurses?

824
00:34:09,915 --> 00:34:11,483
I wasn't.

825
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:13,485
I know you don't like
this part of the job,

826
00:34:13,552 --> 00:34:14,653
but it's part of the job.

827
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:17,188
If Prescott gives in
to their demands,

828
00:34:17,256 --> 00:34:19,190
they go out of business,
the nurses get nothing,

829
00:34:19,258 --> 00:34:20,392
it's a win-win.

830
00:34:20,459 --> 00:34:21,459
That's bullshit.

831
00:34:21,527 --> 00:34:24,696
It's a win
because you beat Daniel.

832
00:34:24,764 --> 00:34:26,131
I work with him,
I work with you,

833
00:34:26,198 --> 00:34:28,433
I work with him...
it doesn't take a genius

834
00:34:28,501 --> 00:34:29,801
to figure out that
you're playing each other,

835
00:34:29,869 --> 00:34:31,436
and you're using me to do it.

836
00:34:31,504 --> 00:34:34,239
But you know what,
I don't care what's going on

837
00:34:34,307 --> 00:34:35,807
between the two of you,
but I don't want to be caught

838
00:34:35,875 --> 00:34:37,309
in the middle of it ever again.

839
00:34:56,462 --> 00:34:59,531
Grammy, if that's you,
I swear to God,

840
00:34:59,598 --> 00:35:03,501
I'm going to have
the locks changed.

841
00:35:03,569 --> 00:35:04,769
Rachel.

842
00:35:04,837 --> 00:35:06,504
You hurt me.

843
00:35:06,572 --> 00:35:07,572
- I'm sorry.
- No.

844
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:09,174
All those nice things you said,

845
00:35:09,241 --> 00:35:12,277
those are the kinds of things
you say when you...

846
00:35:12,345 --> 00:35:13,445
look, if you feel
those things about me,

847
00:35:13,512 --> 00:35:15,413
why can't you be with me?

848
00:35:17,483 --> 00:35:20,118
I told you,
you know, it's... it's work

849
00:35:20,186 --> 00:35:21,386
and... and that guy.

850
00:35:21,454 --> 00:35:22,921
It's everything, you know?

851
00:35:22,988 --> 00:35:24,189
I just... I don't think
it would work.

852
00:35:24,256 --> 00:35:26,424
I think it would be a mistake.

853
00:35:26,492 --> 00:35:27,892
Yeah, you know what?
You did say that.

854
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,527
And it's a lot of bullshit
because the Mike that I know

855
00:35:29,595 --> 00:35:32,163
and the Mike that I fell for...
he wouldn't do this.

856
00:35:32,231 --> 00:35:36,368
And if all of your feelings
are still there,

857
00:35:36,435 --> 00:35:37,769
then it only points
to one thing.

858
00:35:37,837 --> 00:35:40,739
And it's that you're keeping
something from me.

859
00:35:43,609 --> 00:35:45,910
I don't want to lie to you.

860
00:35:45,978 --> 00:35:49,514
Then don't.

861
00:35:49,582 --> 00:35:52,317
Please, just...

862
00:35:52,385 --> 00:35:57,655
just tell me what it is.

863
00:36:01,761 --> 00:36:03,762
I thought so.

864
00:36:03,829 --> 00:36:05,463
- Rachel...
- I'm done.

865
00:36:05,531 --> 00:36:07,866
Rachel. Rachel, wait!

866
00:36:09,068 --> 00:36:11,002
Rachel!

867
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:13,338
Rachel, stop.
Please, let me explain.

868
00:36:13,406 --> 00:36:14,672
- How?
- Look, I want to tell you.

869
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:16,408
- Then tell me.
- I can't.

870
00:36:16,475 --> 00:36:19,010
Why? I mean,
what could it possibly be?

871
00:36:19,078 --> 00:36:20,445
You're... you're married?

872
00:36:20,513 --> 00:36:22,580
You're some kind of spy?
No, you don't understand.

873
00:36:22,648 --> 00:36:25,483
Look, once I tell you,
I can never take it back.

874
00:36:25,551 --> 00:36:30,221
This is my everything.

875
00:36:30,289 --> 00:36:32,424
I can't.

876
00:36:55,028 --> 00:36:56,882
Did you have fun?

877
00:36:56,885 --> 00:36:58,519
I wouldn't say fun.

878
00:37:00,655 --> 00:37:02,790
You celebrating winning
the case or beating me?

879
00:37:02,858 --> 00:37:04,658
Two for the price of one.

880
00:37:04,726 --> 00:37:06,894
Jessica loves a bargain.

881
00:37:06,962 --> 00:37:09,296
You here for another round? No.

882
00:37:09,364 --> 00:37:12,433
I'm not here to start a fight.
I'm here to apologize for one.

883
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:15,603
The partner meeting...
you were welcoming me back.

884
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:18,138
But I saw you sitting there
in my old chair,

885
00:37:18,206 --> 00:37:20,274
and I just...

886
00:37:20,342 --> 00:37:23,510
I'm sorry.

887
00:37:23,578 --> 00:37:28,115
His words sound good.

888
00:37:28,183 --> 00:37:29,416
Only one problem.

889
00:37:29,484 --> 00:37:32,586
You were starting stuff
before you even got here.

890
00:37:32,654 --> 00:37:35,022
Gifts to everyone,
digging into cases,

891
00:37:35,090 --> 00:37:37,658
constructing a new office.

892
00:37:37,726 --> 00:37:38,893
That was all part
of coming back.

893
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,628
Not furnishing it
with my tea set.

894
00:37:40,695 --> 00:37:42,363
That's what this is about?

895
00:37:42,430 --> 00:37:45,299
Don't you remember
where you got that tea set?

896
00:37:45,367 --> 00:37:48,102
Alicia gave it to you.

897
00:37:48,169 --> 00:37:50,471
And I took it
because I missed her.

898
00:37:50,538 --> 00:37:52,973
I'm sorry.

899
00:37:53,041 --> 00:37:55,209
I thought
you would understand that.

900
00:38:03,885 --> 00:38:05,953
- Hey.
- Hey.

901
00:38:06,021 --> 00:38:07,421
I need a copy
of the final agreement

902
00:38:07,489 --> 00:38:09,490
the nurses signed.
Yup, got it right here.

903
00:38:09,557 --> 00:38:12,393
Thank you.

904
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:13,827
You look different.

905
00:38:13,895 --> 00:38:16,163
New clothes. Hair like that.

906
00:38:16,231 --> 00:38:18,499
You have a date.

907
00:38:18,566 --> 00:38:21,402
- Good night, Donna.
- Good night, Rachel.

908
00:38:24,439 --> 00:38:25,539
Mind if I come in?

909
00:38:25,607 --> 00:38:27,241
Uh, truth be told,

910
00:38:27,309 --> 00:38:28,842
I was taking off
for the afternoon.

911
00:38:28,910 --> 00:38:30,711
Late night?

912
00:38:30,779 --> 00:38:32,613
- Nothing I can't handle.
- I believe it.

913
00:38:32,681 --> 00:38:34,181
I heard your speech
to the associates.

914
00:38:34,249 --> 00:38:37,017
And I just wanted to tell you
how impressed I was.

915
00:38:37,085 --> 00:38:38,686
Thank you.

916
00:38:38,753 --> 00:38:40,587
I always knew you were
the right man for the job,

917
00:38:40,655 --> 00:38:45,626
so it feels good to see it
in action.

918
00:38:45,694 --> 00:38:47,861
Something wrong? No.

919
00:38:47,929 --> 00:38:50,097
Louis.

920
00:38:51,499 --> 00:38:54,702
If you really heard me
in there,

921
00:38:54,769 --> 00:38:56,737
you'd know that I give them
the chance to rise

922
00:38:56,805 --> 00:38:59,773
to the occasion.

923
00:38:59,841 --> 00:39:01,275
And I just wish every once
in a while,

924
00:39:01,343 --> 00:39:04,845
you might maybe
do the same for me.

925
00:39:14,255 --> 00:39:16,857
You wanted to see me?

926
00:39:16,925 --> 00:39:18,892
Yeah, Mike. Sit down.

927
00:39:29,371 --> 00:39:31,238
I wanted to tell you a story
that I should have told you

928
00:39:31,306 --> 00:39:32,740
the day Daniel came back.

929
00:39:32,807 --> 00:39:35,476
When Jessica and I found out

930
00:39:35,543 --> 00:39:37,544
that Daniel was embezzling
from clients,

931
00:39:37,612 --> 00:39:39,413
we confronted him.

932
00:39:39,481 --> 00:39:40,714
He broke down.

933
00:39:40,782 --> 00:39:42,116
He said his wife had cancer,

934
00:39:42,183 --> 00:39:44,685
and he needed the money to try
and save her life.

935
00:39:44,753 --> 00:39:47,287
Turns out, he needed the money

936
00:39:47,355 --> 00:39:51,258
to support his mistress.

937
00:39:51,326 --> 00:39:52,893
Now he's saying he's different.

938
00:39:52,961 --> 00:39:54,194
But a man who would do that

939
00:39:54,262 --> 00:39:57,131
is a man I find
very difficult to trust.

940
00:39:59,401 --> 00:40:00,768
Do you trust me?

941
00:40:00,835 --> 00:40:04,271
That's what
I wanted you to know.

942
00:40:14,149 --> 00:40:15,816
Is this your first time?

943
00:40:15,884 --> 00:40:18,886
No. I'm just...

944
00:40:18,953 --> 00:40:20,354
trying to forget
about the other times.

945
00:40:20,422 --> 00:40:21,688
Start fresh.

946
00:40:21,756 --> 00:40:23,390
Look, I mean to be rude.

947
00:40:23,458 --> 00:40:24,825
I just really want
to concentrate.

948
00:40:24,893 --> 00:40:26,593
You have three hours
to complete the exam.

949
00:40:26,661 --> 00:40:31,732
Good luck.
Your time starts now.

950
00:40:46,514 --> 00:40:48,515
Three times in one week.

951
00:40:48,583 --> 00:40:50,818
I might have to write you back
into my will.

952
00:40:54,522 --> 00:40:56,457
What's wrong?

953
00:41:09,304 --> 00:41:12,239
Plavix...

954
00:41:12,307 --> 00:41:14,675
stuck in my head,
so I looked it up.

955
00:41:14,742 --> 00:41:19,179
Something that you take
when you have a heart problem.

956
00:41:19,247 --> 00:41:21,482
Michael, I'm 82 years old.

957
00:41:21,549 --> 00:41:23,517
I have an everything problem.

958
00:41:23,585 --> 00:41:25,652
Why didn't you tell me?

959
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:27,654
That getting old sucks?

960
00:41:27,722 --> 00:41:29,490
You'll find out.

961
00:41:29,557 --> 00:41:31,391
And I don't tell you
every little thing

962
00:41:31,459 --> 00:41:32,693
because I don't want you
to worry.

963
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:34,261
And if you looked it up,

964
00:41:34,329 --> 00:41:37,698
you'd know that it's...
it's for preventive purposes.

965
00:41:37,765 --> 00:41:39,299
Did you read that part?

966
00:41:39,367 --> 00:41:40,934
Yeah, I kind of panicked

967
00:41:41,002 --> 00:41:42,703
when I got
to the heart problem part.

968
00:41:42,770 --> 00:41:45,772
I hope you do
a more thorough job at work.

969
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:47,241
Okay, I make the trip down here

970
00:41:47,308 --> 00:41:49,676
to express some serious concern,
and you mock me?

971
00:41:49,744 --> 00:41:52,479
With love.

972
00:41:54,682 --> 00:41:56,350
Okay.

973
00:41:56,417 --> 00:41:59,186
Enough of your stupid
health problems,

974
00:41:59,254 --> 00:42:01,188
let's get down to business,
deal with some of my real ones.

975
00:42:01,256 --> 00:42:02,256
You're young.

976
00:42:02,323 --> 00:42:03,891
You don't have
any real problems.

977
00:42:03,958 --> 00:42:06,160
Wrong.
I am making way too much money,

978
00:42:06,261 --> 00:42:07,761
and I don't have a girlfriend
to spend it on.

979
00:42:07,829 --> 00:42:10,731
I know a few single ladies.

980
00:42:10,798 --> 00:42:12,599
Really?

981
00:42:12,667 --> 00:42:15,469
I can't go older than 70 though.
It's a ground rule.
