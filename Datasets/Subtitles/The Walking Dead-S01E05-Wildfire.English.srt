1
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:04,922
- ( walkie-talkie squawks )
- Rick: Morgan,

2
00:00:05,964 --> 00:00:08,008
I don't know if you're out there.

3
00:00:08,175 --> 00:00:10,135
I don't know
if you can hear me.

4
00:00:10,302 --> 00:00:12,513
Maybe you're listening right now.

5
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:14,055
I hope so.

6
00:00:14,222 --> 00:00:16,891
I found others-- my family,

7
00:00:17,058 --> 00:00:18,518
if you can believe it.

8
00:00:18,684 --> 00:00:20,520
( static )

9
00:00:20,686 --> 00:00:22,688
My wife and son,

10
00:00:22,855 --> 00:00:24,523
they're alive.

11
00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:27,025
I wanted you to know that.

12
00:00:29,945 --> 00:00:31,613
There's something else
you need to know.

13
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:33,532
Atlanta isn't what we thought.

14
00:00:33,698 --> 00:00:36,075
It's not what they promised.
The city is--

15
00:00:37,743 --> 00:00:40,704
do not enter the city.

16
00:00:40,871 --> 00:00:43,374
It belongs to the dead now.

17
00:00:47,127 --> 00:00:49,838
We're camped
a few miles northwest,

18
00:00:50,005 --> 00:00:52,049
up by a big abandoned
rock quarry.

19
00:00:52,216 --> 00:00:54,760
You can see it on a map.

20
00:00:56,762 --> 00:00:58,472
I hope you come find us.

21
00:00:58,639 --> 00:01:00,724
But be careful.

22
00:01:01,976 --> 00:01:04,645
Last night walkers
came out of the woods.

23
00:01:07,106 --> 00:01:09,066
We lost people.

24
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,405
Watch yourself, Morgan.
Take care of your boy.

25
00:01:14,572 --> 00:01:16,407
I'll try you again
tomorrow at dawn.

26
00:01:16,574 --> 00:01:19,785
( static )

27
00:01:34,633 --> 00:01:36,385
Andrea.

28
00:01:42,349 --> 00:01:44,351
I'm so sorry.

29
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:48,689
She's gone.

30
00:01:48,856 --> 00:01:51,817
You got to let us take her.

31
00:01:58,907 --> 00:02:00,117
We all cared about her

32
00:02:00,284 --> 00:02:03,453
and I promise
we'll be as gentle as we can.

33
00:02:20,803 --> 00:02:22,930
( grunts )

34
00:02:32,774 --> 00:02:35,068
( coughing )

35
00:02:41,324 --> 00:02:43,533
She still won't move?

36
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:46,077
Lori:
Won't even talk to us.

37
00:02:47,453 --> 00:02:49,622
She's been there all night.

38
00:02:49,789 --> 00:02:51,749
What do we do?

39
00:02:51,916 --> 00:02:54,835
Can't just leave Amy like that.

40
00:02:55,002 --> 00:02:57,004
We need to deal with it

41
00:02:57,171 --> 00:02:59,090
same as the others.

42
00:03:00,549 --> 00:03:02,509
I'll tell her how it is.

43
00:03:06,638 --> 00:03:08,598
- Andrea.
- ( cocks )

44
00:03:09,682 --> 00:03:11,767
I know how the safety works.

45
00:03:15,354 --> 00:03:17,731
All right. Okay.

46
00:03:17,898 --> 00:03:20,025
I'm sorry.

47
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:24,821
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

48
00:03:38,042 --> 00:03:40,712
( theme music playing )

49
00:04:13,786 --> 00:04:15,288 X1:0
Daryl:
Y'all can't be serious.

50
00:04:15,455 --> 00:04:17,331 X1:0
Let that girl hamstring us?

51
00:04:17,498 --> 00:04:18,958 X1:0
The dead girl's a time bomb.

52
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:21,294 X1:0
Rick:
What do you suggest?

53
00:04:23,004 --> 00:04:24,422 X1:0
Take the shot.

54
00:04:24,589 --> 00:04:26,924 X1:0
Clean, in the brain from here.

55
00:04:27,091 --> 00:04:29,594 X1:0
Hell, I can hit a turkey between
the eyes from this distance.

56
00:04:29,761 --> 00:04:32,764 X1:0
No. For God's sakes, let her be.

57
00:04:41,022 --> 00:04:42,606 X1:0
( scoffs )

58
00:04:46,443 --> 00:04:49,154 X1:0
Wake up, Jimbo.
We've got some work to do.

59
00:04:50,781 --> 00:04:52,824 X1:0
( panting )

60
00:04:52,991 --> 00:04:55,285 X1:0
Morales: Thanks.

61
00:04:55,452 --> 00:04:57,287
- Thanks.
- What are you guys doing?

62
00:04:57,454 --> 00:05:00,123
This is for geeks.
Our people go over there.

63
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:02,082
Daryl: What's the difference?
They're all infected.

64
00:05:02,249 --> 00:05:05,628
Glenn: Our people go
in that row over there.

65
00:05:05,795 --> 00:05:08,297
We don't burn them!

66
00:05:08,464 --> 00:05:10,633
We bury them.

67
00:05:12,133 --> 00:05:14,260
Understand?

68
00:05:17,429 --> 00:05:20,641 X1:0
Our people go
in that row over there.

69
00:05:26,563 --> 00:05:27,981 X1:0
You reap what you sow.

70
00:05:28,148 --> 00:05:30,150 X1:0
Morales:
You know what? Shut up, man.

71
00:05:30,317 --> 00:05:32,319 X1:0
Y'all left my brother for dead.

72
00:05:33,821 --> 00:05:35,989
You had this coming.

73
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:47,458
Are you bleeding?

74
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:50,837
I just got some on me
from the bodies.

75
00:05:51,003 --> 00:05:53,172
That blood is fresh.
Were you bit?

76
00:05:53,339 --> 00:05:54,507
Jim: No.

77
00:05:54,674 --> 00:05:56,550
I got scratched during the attack.

78
00:05:56,716 --> 00:05:58,218
- You got bit.
- I'm fine.

79
00:05:58,385 --> 00:06:00,011
Then show me.

80
00:06:04,474 --> 00:06:06,601
- ( whispers ) Don't tell, please.
- A walker got him.

81
00:06:06,768 --> 00:06:08,854
A walker bit Jim.

82
00:06:11,982 --> 00:06:14,693
- Jim: I'm okay. I'm okay.
- Show it to us.

83
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:17,612
- Show it to us.
- ( chattering )

84
00:06:17,779 --> 00:06:19,197
- Shane: Easy, Jim.
- Daryl: Grab him.

85
00:06:19,364 --> 00:06:21,575
Jim, put it down. Put it down.

86
00:06:21,741 --> 00:06:23,994
I'm okay.
I'm okay.

87
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,872
I'm okay. I'm okay.

88
00:06:27,038 --> 00:06:28,998
I'm okay.

89
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:32,834
I'm okay. I'm okay.

90
00:06:33,001 --> 00:06:34,961
I'm okay.

91
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:37,380
I'm okay.
( breathing heavily )

92
00:06:41,259 --> 00:06:42,927
I'm okay.

93
00:06:49,392 --> 00:06:51,394
I say we put
a pickaxe in his head

94
00:06:51,561 --> 00:06:52,853
and the dead girl's
and be done with it.

95
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:54,896
Is that what you'd want
if it were you?

96
00:06:55,062 --> 00:06:57,189
Yeah, and I'd thank you
while you did it.

97
00:06:57,356 --> 00:06:59,232
I hate to say it--
I never thought I would--

98
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:00,859
but maybe Daryl's right.

99
00:07:01,026 --> 00:07:03,862
Jim's not a monster, Dale,
or some rabid dog.

100
00:07:04,029 --> 00:07:06,197
- I'm not suggesting--
- He's sick. A sick man.

101
00:07:06,364 --> 00:07:08,199
We start down that road,
where do we draw the line?

102
00:07:08,366 --> 00:07:11,745
The line's pretty clear.
Zero tolerance for walkers,

103
00:07:11,912 --> 00:07:14,289
- or them to be.
- What if we can get him help?

104
00:07:14,456 --> 00:07:16,458
I heard the CDC
was working on a cure.

105
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:19,586
I heard that too. Heard a lot of things
before the world went to hell.

106
00:07:19,753 --> 00:07:21,713
What if the CDC is
still up and running?

107
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,798
- Man, that is a stretch right there.
- Rick: Why?

108
00:07:23,965 --> 00:07:27,761
If there's any government left,
any structure at all,

109
00:07:27,928 --> 00:07:29,930
they'd protect the CDC
at all costs, wouldn't they?

110
00:07:30,096 --> 00:07:32,641
I think it's our best shot.
Shelter, protection--

111
00:07:32,807 --> 00:07:35,727
Okay, Rick, you want those things,
all right? I do too, okay?

112
00:07:35,894 --> 00:07:39,981
Now if they exist, they're at
the army base. Fort Benning.

113
00:07:40,148 --> 00:07:41,274
That's 100 miles
in the opposite direction.

114
00:07:41,441 --> 00:07:43,360
That is right.
But it's away from the hot zone.

115
00:07:43,526 --> 00:07:45,278
Now listen to me.
If that place is operational,

116
00:07:45,445 --> 00:07:48,490
it'll be heavily armed.
We'd be safe there.

117
00:07:48,657 --> 00:07:50,784
Rick: The military were
on the front lines of this thing.

118
00:07:50,951 --> 00:07:53,036
They got overrun.
We've all seen that.

119
00:07:53,203 --> 00:07:56,289
The CDC is our best choice
and Jim's only chance.

120
00:07:58,917 --> 00:08:01,670
You go looking for aspirin,
do what you need to do.

121
00:08:01,836 --> 00:08:03,588
Someone needs to have
some balls to take care

122
00:08:03,755 --> 00:08:05,215
- of this damn problem!
- Hey hey hey!

123
00:08:05,382 --> 00:08:07,300
We don't kill the living.

124
00:08:10,303 --> 00:08:13,765
That's funny coming from a man
who just put a gun to my head.

125
00:08:13,932 --> 00:08:16,267
We may disagree
on some things,

126
00:08:16,434 --> 00:08:19,062
not on this.
You put it down.

127
00:08:19,229 --> 00:08:20,647
Go on.

128
00:08:25,151 --> 00:08:26,861
- Come with me.
- Where are you taking me?

129
00:08:27,028 --> 00:08:29,114
Somewhere safe.

130
00:08:37,539 --> 00:08:40,208
I came to pay my respects.

131
00:08:58,143 --> 00:09:00,645
Did I ever mention

132
00:09:00,812 --> 00:09:03,732
how I lost my wife?

133
00:09:07,485 --> 00:09:09,696
- Cancer, wasn't it?
- Yeah.

134
00:09:10,822 --> 00:09:13,491
I dragged her to every doctor,

135
00:09:13,658 --> 00:09:15,869
every test.

136
00:09:16,995 --> 00:09:20,415
And after all the surgeries
and the chemos,

137
00:09:20,582 --> 00:09:23,209
she was ready.

138
00:09:23,376 --> 00:09:25,837
She accepted it, you know?

139
00:09:27,964 --> 00:09:30,549
But I never could.

140
00:09:30,716 --> 00:09:34,344
And I spent the last few years

141
00:09:34,511 --> 00:09:37,056
so angry.

142
00:09:37,222 --> 00:09:39,850
I felt so cheated.

143
00:09:44,021 --> 00:09:46,440
Since she passed,

144
00:09:46,607 --> 00:09:50,277
you girls were the first people...

145
00:09:52,153 --> 00:09:54,072
that I cared anything for.

146
00:10:13,341 --> 00:10:15,426
This is her birthday?

147
00:10:18,595 --> 00:10:20,764
Her birthday was always like--

148
00:10:20,931 --> 00:10:23,724
like a week long affair.

149
00:10:23,891 --> 00:10:27,144
But I somehow always missed it.

150
00:10:27,311 --> 00:10:29,271
I was away at college

151
00:10:29,438 --> 00:10:31,982
or too busy for kid's parties.

152
00:10:32,149 --> 00:10:35,569
She'd call all excited.

153
00:10:35,736 --> 00:10:39,115
I always said that I'd make it home

154
00:10:39,281 --> 00:10:42,284
and I really always meant to,

155
00:10:42,451 --> 00:10:46,747
but I never made it
past that phone call.

156
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:49,959
I know things
are hard enough for you

157
00:10:50,126 --> 00:10:53,170
without adding guilt
into the mix, huh?

158
00:11:28,831 --> 00:11:30,331
( head squishes )

159
00:11:37,297 --> 00:11:41,009
I'll do it. He's my husband.

160
00:11:41,176 --> 00:11:43,178
( crying )

161
00:12:04,115 --> 00:12:06,576
( groans )

162
00:12:12,498 --> 00:12:15,126
( grunting )

163
00:12:26,221 --> 00:12:28,765
( sobbing )

164
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:47,742
( shallow breathing )

165
00:12:55,917 --> 00:12:58,002
( breathing )

166
00:13:47,969 --> 00:13:50,554
Amy.

167
00:13:56,143 --> 00:13:58,312
Amy, I'm sorry.

168
00:14:05,067 --> 00:14:07,111
I'm sorry

169
00:14:07,278 --> 00:14:09,905
for not ever being there.

170
00:14:11,489 --> 00:14:14,658
I always thought
there'd be more time.

171
00:14:18,662 --> 00:14:21,332
( growling )

172
00:14:36,722 --> 00:14:38,849
I'm here now, Amy.

173
00:14:39,016 --> 00:14:41,601
I'm here.

174
00:14:46,689 --> 00:14:48,900
I love you.

175
00:14:49,067 --> 00:14:51,069
( gunshot )

176
00:15:14,384 --> 00:15:16,636
Say it.

177
00:15:18,721 --> 00:15:20,723
Okay.

178
00:15:23,142 --> 00:15:24,977
I'm thinking
if you'd have stayed here,

179
00:15:25,144 --> 00:15:27,605
if you'd have looked
after your own--

180
00:15:27,772 --> 00:15:31,401
instead you went off.
You took half our manpower with you.

181
00:15:31,567 --> 00:15:34,404
I'm thinking maybe our losses
wouldn't have been so bad.

182
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:36,906
If we hadn't gone off
and brought those guns back

183
00:15:37,073 --> 00:15:39,866
when we did, I think our losses
would have been a lot worse.

184
00:15:40,033 --> 00:15:42,244
- Maybe the entire camp.
- ( truck approaching )

185
00:15:42,411 --> 00:15:44,329
( exhales )

186
00:15:56,591 --> 00:15:59,469
I still think it's a mistake
not burning these bodies.

187
00:15:59,636 --> 00:16:01,680
It's what we said we'd do, right?

188
00:16:01,847 --> 00:16:04,640
Burn ‘em all, wasn't that the idea?

189
00:16:04,807 --> 00:16:06,058
Shane:
At first.

190
00:16:06,225 --> 00:16:07,768
The Chinaman gets
all emotional,

191
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:10,896
says it's not the thing to do,
we just follow him along?

192
00:16:12,648 --> 00:16:15,484
These people need to know
who the hell's in charge here,

193
00:16:15,651 --> 00:16:18,446
- what the rules are.
- There are no rules.

194
00:16:18,612 --> 00:16:20,614
Lori:
Well, that's a problem.

195
00:16:20,781 --> 00:16:23,868
We haven't had one minute
to hold onto anything of our old selves.

196
00:16:24,034 --> 00:16:28,289
We need time to mourn
and we need to bury our dead.

197
00:16:28,456 --> 00:16:30,374
It's what people do.

198
00:16:32,209 --> 00:16:34,962
Oh no.

199
00:16:35,129 --> 00:16:37,338
No no no no.

200
00:16:37,505 --> 00:16:40,550
No, not this, please.

201
00:16:45,721 --> 00:16:47,639
( groans )

202
00:16:47,806 --> 00:16:50,142
- ( panting )
- ( zombies growling )

203
00:16:53,311 --> 00:16:55,563
No no no.

204
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:58,191
Oh, no no no.

205
00:16:58,357 --> 00:17:01,318
- No no.
- ( people scream )

206
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:05,404
( panting )

207
00:17:10,783 --> 00:17:12,827
( crying )
I can do it. I can do it.

208
00:17:12,994 --> 00:17:15,622
I can do it!
I can do it.

209
00:17:34,265 --> 00:17:36,267
( crying )

210
00:17:43,858 --> 00:17:45,777
Dale: Hey.

211
00:17:47,986 --> 00:17:50,489
( panting )

212
00:17:57,955 --> 00:17:59,998
Burying other people
is bad enough,

213
00:18:00,165 --> 00:18:02,209
- but the thought of one of us--
- Lori: Shh.

214
00:18:02,376 --> 00:18:05,003
Are we safe now, Dad?

215
00:18:06,046 --> 00:18:07,714
Now that we're together?

216
00:18:07,881 --> 00:18:09,841
I won't leave again.

217
00:18:10,008 --> 00:18:12,052
I promise you that.
Not for anything.

218
00:18:14,805 --> 00:18:17,558
Now give me a chance

219
00:18:17,724 --> 00:18:19,518
to discuss some things
with your mom, okay?

220
00:18:19,685 --> 00:18:21,561
- Yeah.
- Rick: All right.

221
00:18:21,727 --> 00:18:23,479
All right.

222
00:18:30,152 --> 00:18:33,321
Shane blames me for not being here.

223
00:18:33,488 --> 00:18:35,282
Do you?

224
00:18:41,037 --> 00:18:44,332
We got guns now.
We're stronger.

225
00:18:44,499 --> 00:18:46,251
And we have fewer people.

226
00:18:46,418 --> 00:18:48,795
That makes us weaker.

227
00:18:48,962 --> 00:18:51,047
You want me to say
I think you were right?

228
00:18:51,214 --> 00:18:53,300
I understand that.

229
00:18:56,344 --> 00:19:00,265
All I can say is that neither
one of you is entirely wrong.

230
00:19:00,432 --> 00:19:03,268
It's the best I can do right now.

231
00:19:06,855 --> 00:19:09,064
What about the CDC?

232
00:19:10,608 --> 00:19:12,860
- Rick--
- We're at the ragged edge here.

233
00:19:13,027 --> 00:19:15,988
We need relief and we got
a sick man who needs help.

234
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:17,865
I don't know
why people can't see that.

235
00:19:18,032 --> 00:19:19,824
Well, look at their faces.

236
00:19:19,991 --> 00:19:22,576
Look at mine.
We're all terrified.

237
00:19:22,743 --> 00:19:26,120
If one of us suggested,
based on a hunch,

238
00:19:26,287 --> 00:19:28,331
that we head toward that city,

239
00:19:28,497 --> 00:19:30,416
you'd have no part of it.

240
00:19:32,877 --> 00:19:35,338
Tell me something with certainty.

241
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:47,308
I love you.

242
00:19:52,146 --> 00:19:54,982
That's-- that's all--
that's all I got.

243
00:19:56,901 --> 00:19:58,736
I love you too.

244
00:20:03,491 --> 00:20:05,493
( door opens )

245
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:07,662
( knocks )

246
00:20:10,122 --> 00:20:12,625
His fever is worse.

247
00:20:12,792 --> 00:20:14,960
You need anything?

248
00:20:15,127 --> 00:20:16,587
Uh...

249
00:20:16,754 --> 00:20:19,674
water.
Could use more water.

250
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,132
- Lori: I'll get some.
- Okay.

251
00:20:21,299 --> 00:20:23,676
Lori:
Carol, you help me?

252
00:20:35,979 --> 00:20:38,107
You save a grave for me?

253
00:20:40,609 --> 00:20:42,193
Nobody wants that.

254
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:45,029
Jim:
It's not about what you want.

255
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:50,618
That, uh-- that sound you hear,

256
00:20:50,785 --> 00:20:53,788
that's God laughing
while you make plans.

257
00:21:00,586 --> 00:21:03,047
What I want, Jim, if--

258
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:05,882
if God allows,

259
00:21:06,049 --> 00:21:08,634
is to get you some help.

260
00:21:08,801 --> 00:21:10,344
( groans )

261
00:21:10,511 --> 00:21:12,638
( coughing )

262
00:21:15,725 --> 00:21:18,185
( spits )

263
00:21:28,738 --> 00:21:31,323
( groans, inhales deeply )

264
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:34,368
( coughs )

265
00:21:38,581 --> 00:21:40,499
Watch the mangroves.

266
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:43,753
Their roots will gouge
the whole boat.

267
00:21:44,754 --> 00:21:47,465
You know that, right?

268
00:21:47,631 --> 00:21:51,719
Amy is there swimming.

269
00:21:54,221 --> 00:21:57,141
You'll watch the boat, right?

270
00:21:57,308 --> 00:21:59,435
You said you would.

271
00:22:01,771 --> 00:22:03,689
I'll watch the boat.

272
00:22:03,856 --> 00:22:06,025
Don't worry.

273
00:22:10,112 --> 00:22:11,864
Okay.

274
00:22:23,042 --> 00:22:25,669
I need you to help talk
some sense into Rick.

275
00:22:28,964 --> 00:22:31,967
Look, this CDC thing,
Lori, it's a mistake.

276
00:22:33,677 --> 00:22:34,969
So you're backing him?

277
00:22:35,136 --> 00:22:37,055
What else would I do?
He's my husband.

278
00:22:37,222 --> 00:22:39,599
Look, it may be time
for you to play the dutiful wife,

279
00:22:39,766 --> 00:22:41,392
but you can't tell me
that fixing your marriage

280
00:22:41,559 --> 00:22:43,311
is worth putting
people's lives at risk.

281
00:22:43,478 --> 00:22:44,813
I think folks around here
can make up their minds

282
00:22:44,979 --> 00:22:47,106
without bringing my marriage into it.

283
00:22:47,273 --> 00:22:49,275
It's a habit you need to break.

284
00:22:50,693 --> 00:22:52,153
I guess I'll just add it to the list

285
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,947
of habits that I'm breaking

286
00:22:54,113 --> 00:22:55,615
whether I like it or not.

287
00:22:57,784 --> 00:23:00,078
What habits?

288
00:23:01,412 --> 00:23:04,165
Just talking about
my need for a plan, man.

289
00:23:05,708 --> 00:23:07,418
So what is it?
Are we leaving or not?

290
00:23:07,585 --> 00:23:09,629
Maybe y'all just want to stay here.

291
00:23:09,796 --> 00:23:11,965
We could hang some more tin cans.

292
00:23:12,131 --> 00:23:13,591
We can't stay here.
We both know that.

293
00:23:13,758 --> 00:23:16,845
I was just telling Shane I think
we should trust your gut.

294
00:23:25,854 --> 00:23:28,189
Let's go do our sweep.

295
00:23:38,199 --> 00:23:39,783
Shane:
Tell you what, man,

296
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:42,159
these people, man,
they're not convinced.

297
00:23:42,326 --> 00:23:43,744
You know?

298
00:23:43,911 --> 00:23:45,997
You head to the CDC,

299
00:23:46,163 --> 00:23:48,165
you might be on your own.

300
00:23:48,332 --> 00:23:50,709
You gotta really consider
whether you want

301
00:23:50,876 --> 00:23:52,836
to put Lori and Carl
in that kind of spot.

302
00:23:53,003 --> 00:23:55,505
I got to do
what's best for my family.

303
00:23:55,672 --> 00:23:57,757
Best for your family?
What's that?

304
00:23:57,924 --> 00:24:01,052
- Exposing them to all kinds of risks?
- As opposed to what?

305
00:24:01,219 --> 00:24:03,847
Crossing 100 miles
of hostile territory?

306
00:24:04,014 --> 00:24:07,517
If we're looking for a lifeline,
I say swim toward the closest ship,

307
00:24:07,684 --> 00:24:09,978
not further out to sea.

308
00:24:10,145 --> 00:24:11,897
Why can't you back me up?

309
00:24:12,063 --> 00:24:14,648
Shane:
Look, I want to. It's just...

310
00:24:14,815 --> 00:24:17,526
I don't see it.

311
00:24:17,693 --> 00:24:20,070
If it was your family,
you'd feel differently.

312
00:24:25,075 --> 00:24:27,660
What did you say to me?

313
00:24:29,746 --> 00:24:31,998
I kept ‘em safe, man.

314
00:24:32,165 --> 00:24:35,418
I looked after them like they were--
no, they were my own.

315
00:24:35,585 --> 00:24:37,587
- That's what I did, Rick.
- Shane, I didn't mean it that way.

316
00:24:37,754 --> 00:24:39,797
Well, how'd you mean it?

317
00:24:39,964 --> 00:24:41,424
Go on, man. How'd you mean it?

318
00:24:41,591 --> 00:24:44,594
( sighs )
You're misinterpreting me, man.

319
00:24:44,761 --> 00:24:46,387
- All right.
- You're just hearing it wrong.

320
00:24:46,554 --> 00:24:48,806
- Yeah?
- Look, you know--

321
00:24:48,973 --> 00:24:52,685
you know I can never
repay that debt, okay?

322
00:24:52,852 --> 00:24:55,521
( branch snaps )

323
00:25:38,815 --> 00:25:40,942
Jesus.

324
00:25:43,069 --> 00:25:45,113
( chuckles )

325
00:25:47,031 --> 00:25:49,283
I know.

326
00:25:51,159 --> 00:25:53,954
Gonna have to start wearing
reflective vests out here.

327
00:25:57,165 --> 00:25:59,001
Seriously.

328
00:25:59,167 --> 00:26:02,336
Come on, man.

329
00:26:05,673 --> 00:26:07,008
Come on, man, let's go.

330
00:26:07,174 --> 00:26:09,176
Nothing out here.

331
00:26:25,109 --> 00:26:27,236
Shane:
I've, uh--

332
00:26:27,403 --> 00:26:29,739
I've been thinking
about Rick's plan.

333
00:26:29,905 --> 00:26:31,699
Now look, there are no--

334
00:26:31,866 --> 00:26:34,243
there are no guarantees
either way.

335
00:26:34,410 --> 00:26:37,079
I'll be the first one to admit that.

336
00:26:37,246 --> 00:26:39,498
I've known this man a long time.

337
00:26:40,958 --> 00:26:42,501
I trust his instincts.

338
00:26:45,254 --> 00:26:49,091
I say the most important thing here
is we need to stay together.

339
00:26:51,969 --> 00:26:56,057
So those of you that agree,

340
00:26:56,223 --> 00:26:57,975
we leave first thing
in the morning.

341
00:27:00,603 --> 00:27:01,854
Okay?

342
00:27:07,401 --> 00:27:09,403
- ( walkie-talkie squawks )
- We're moving out,

343
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:12,239
leaving the quarry.

344
00:27:12,406 --> 00:27:14,909
If you heard me yesterday,
you may be coming here.

345
00:27:15,076 --> 00:27:18,913
If you are, we'll be gone
by the time you arrive.

346
00:27:20,456 --> 00:27:23,375
I'm leaving a note
and map behind for you

347
00:27:23,542 --> 00:27:25,252
taped to a red car

348
00:27:25,419 --> 00:27:27,713
so you can follow our trail.

349
00:27:29,297 --> 00:27:30,840
We're heading to the CDC.

350
00:27:31,007 --> 00:27:32,967
If there's anything left,
it's got to be there,

351
00:27:33,134 --> 00:27:34,928
don't you think?

352
00:27:36,554 --> 00:27:38,348
Morgan...

353
00:27:39,974 --> 00:27:42,102
I hope you were right
about that place.

354
00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:46,355
I need you to be.

355
00:27:48,273 --> 00:27:50,109
( gasps )

356
00:27:50,275 --> 00:27:52,694
( muffled talking )

357
00:27:54,947 --> 00:27:57,156
( coughs )

358
00:27:57,323 --> 00:27:59,075
Shane:
Everybody listen up.

359
00:27:59,242 --> 00:28:02,035
Those of you with CBs,
we're gonna be on channel 40.

360
00:28:02,202 --> 00:28:03,954
Let's keep the chatter down, okay?

361
00:28:04,121 --> 00:28:07,082
Now you got a problem,
don't have a CB,

362
00:28:07,249 --> 00:28:09,417
can't get a signal or anything at all,
you're gonna hit your horn one time.

363
00:28:09,584 --> 00:28:11,378
That'll stop the caravan.

364
00:28:11,545 --> 00:28:14,422
- Any questions?
- Morales: We're, uh--

365
00:28:14,589 --> 00:28:17,050
we're not going.

366
00:28:19,177 --> 00:28:21,930
Woman:
We have family in Birmingham.

367
00:28:22,097 --> 00:28:24,099
We want to be
with our people.

368
00:28:24,266 --> 00:28:26,309
You go on your own, you won't
have anyone to watch your back.

369
00:28:26,476 --> 00:28:28,352
Morales:
We'll take the chance.

370
00:28:28,519 --> 00:28:30,813
I got to do what's best
for my family.

371
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:34,066
- You sure?
- Morales: We talked about it.

372
00:28:34,233 --> 00:28:36,569
We're sure.

373
00:28:36,735 --> 00:28:38,319
All right.

374
00:28:38,486 --> 00:28:40,238
- Shane.
- Yeah, all right.

375
00:28:40,405 --> 00:28:42,532
- Shane: .357?
- Rick: Yeah.

376
00:28:47,996 --> 00:28:49,455
The box is half full.

377
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,211
Thank you all... for everything.

378
00:28:56,378 --> 00:28:58,297
- Lori: Come here.
- ( crying )

379
00:28:58,463 --> 00:29:00,090
Shane:
Good luck, man.

380
00:29:00,257 --> 00:29:02,342
- Morales: Appreciate it.
- Shane: Yeah.

381
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:05,512
- Bye.
- ( Sophia crying )

382
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:07,681
Woman:
Thank you.

383
00:29:07,848 --> 00:29:10,017
Bye.

384
00:29:11,727 --> 00:29:14,104
Channel 40
if you change your minds.

385
00:29:14,271 --> 00:29:15,981
- All right?
- Yeah.

386
00:29:16,148 --> 00:29:18,275
Carol: I know.

387
00:29:21,361 --> 00:29:23,864
What makes you think
our odds are any better?

388
00:29:25,072 --> 00:29:27,116
Come on. Let's go.

389
00:29:27,283 --> 00:29:30,161
- Let's move out.
- ( engines start )

390
00:30:52,118 --> 00:30:54,412
( groaning )

391
00:31:00,793 --> 00:31:02,545
( hissing )

392
00:31:02,712 --> 00:31:04,714
I told you we'd never
get far on that hose.

393
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:07,465
I said I needed the one
from the cube van.

394
00:31:07,632 --> 00:31:09,634
Can you jury-rig it?

395
00:31:09,801 --> 00:31:11,636
That's all it's been so far.

396
00:31:11,803 --> 00:31:14,055
It's more duct tape than hose.

397
00:31:14,222 --> 00:31:16,433
And I'm out of duct tape.

398
00:31:17,976 --> 00:31:19,476
Shane:
I see something up ahead.

399
00:31:19,643 --> 00:31:22,479
A gas station if we're lucky.

400
00:31:22,646 --> 00:31:24,982
Y'all, Jim--

401
00:31:25,149 --> 00:31:27,901
it's bad. I don't think
he can take anymore.

402
00:31:29,611 --> 00:31:31,405
Hey, Rick, you want
to hold down the fort?

403
00:31:31,572 --> 00:31:33,282
I'll drive ahead,
see what I can bring back.

404
00:31:33,449 --> 00:31:35,701
T-Dog: Yeah, I'll come along too
and I'll back you up.

405
00:31:35,868 --> 00:31:37,368
Shane:
Y'all keep your eyes open now.

406
00:31:37,535 --> 00:31:39,119
We'll be right back.

407
00:31:42,664 --> 00:31:44,540
( jeep door opens, closes )

408
00:31:44,707 --> 00:31:46,834
( engine starts, revs )

409
00:31:47,001 --> 00:31:48,419
We'll be back on the road soon.

410
00:31:48,586 --> 00:31:50,838
Jim:
Oh no. Christ.

411
00:31:51,005 --> 00:31:53,299
My bones--

412
00:31:53,466 --> 00:31:54,884
my bones are like glass.

413
00:31:55,051 --> 00:31:56,385
Every little bump--

414
00:31:56,552 --> 00:31:59,430
God, this ride is killing me.

415
00:31:59,597 --> 00:32:02,099
Leave me here.

416
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:06,854
I'm done.

417
00:32:08,856 --> 00:32:11,275
Just leave me.

418
00:32:11,442 --> 00:32:14,195
I want to be with my family.

419
00:32:18,949 --> 00:32:20,368
They're all dead.

420
00:32:21,911 --> 00:32:24,496
I don't think you know
what you're asking.

421
00:32:24,662 --> 00:32:27,999
The fever-- you've been delirious
more often than not.

422
00:32:28,166 --> 00:32:30,042
I know.
Don't you think I know?

423
00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:32,878
( groans )

424
00:32:35,047 --> 00:32:37,424
I'm clear now.

425
00:32:37,591 --> 00:32:40,010
In five minutes I may not be.

426
00:32:40,177 --> 00:32:43,430
Rick, I know what I'm asking.

427
00:32:43,597 --> 00:32:45,349
I want this.

428
00:32:47,059 --> 00:32:49,395
Leave me here.

429
00:32:49,561 --> 00:32:51,563
Now that's on me.

430
00:32:51,730 --> 00:32:53,649
Okay?

431
00:32:53,816 --> 00:32:55,859
My decision.

432
00:32:56,902 --> 00:32:58,570
Not your failure.

433
00:33:03,951 --> 00:33:05,869
It's what he says he wants.

434
00:33:06,036 --> 00:33:08,621
And he's lucid?

435
00:33:08,788 --> 00:33:10,580
He seems to be.

436
00:33:10,747 --> 00:33:12,958
I would say yes.

437
00:33:13,125 --> 00:33:16,461
Dale: Back in the camp
when I said Daryl might be right

438
00:33:16,628 --> 00:33:18,588
and you shut me down,

439
00:33:18,755 --> 00:33:20,924
you misunderstood.

440
00:33:21,091 --> 00:33:24,177
I would never go along

441
00:33:24,344 --> 00:33:27,013
with callously killing a man.

442
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:29,433
I was just gonna suggest

443
00:33:29,599 --> 00:33:33,562
that we ask Jim what he wants.

444
00:33:35,647 --> 00:33:37,941
And I think we have an answer.

445
00:33:39,901 --> 00:33:41,403
Shane:
We just leave him here?

446
00:33:41,570 --> 00:33:43,572
We take off?

447
00:33:43,738 --> 00:33:46,283
Man, I'm not sure
I could live with that.

448
00:33:46,450 --> 00:33:47,742
Lori:
It's not your call,

449
00:33:47,909 --> 00:33:50,120
either one of you.

450
00:33:53,873 --> 00:33:55,791
- Rick: Yeah. That's it.
- ( Jim groans )

451
00:33:55,958 --> 00:33:58,461
( breathing heavily )

452
00:34:01,130 --> 00:34:04,216
Hey, another damn tree.

453
00:34:04,383 --> 00:34:06,135
( chuckles )

454
00:34:07,178 --> 00:34:08,888
Hey, Jim--

455
00:34:09,054 --> 00:34:11,265
I mean, you know
it doesn't need to be this.

456
00:34:11,432 --> 00:34:13,601
No.

457
00:34:14,768 --> 00:34:16,520
It's good.

458
00:34:16,687 --> 00:34:18,731
The breeze feels nice.

459
00:34:18,898 --> 00:34:20,816
Okay.

460
00:34:20,983 --> 00:34:22,318
All right.

461
00:34:29,825 --> 00:34:31,952
Just close your eyes, sweetie.

462
00:34:32,119 --> 00:34:33,829
Don't fight.

463
00:34:46,967 --> 00:34:50,179
Jim, do you want this?

464
00:34:51,471 --> 00:34:52,847
Jim: No.

465
00:34:53,848 --> 00:34:56,059
You'll need it.

466
00:34:58,436 --> 00:35:00,396
I'm okay.

467
00:35:02,732 --> 00:35:04,567
I'm okay.

468
00:35:08,613 --> 00:35:10,740
Oh. Hey.

469
00:35:13,201 --> 00:35:15,370
Thanks for, uh--

470
00:35:15,537 --> 00:35:16,788
for fighting for us.

471
00:35:16,955 --> 00:35:19,666
Okay.
( breathing loudly )

472
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:09,799
( cars starting )

473
00:36:31,571 --> 00:36:33,615
( beeping )

474
00:36:35,783 --> 00:36:38,368
Jenner here.

475
00:36:38,535 --> 00:36:41,955
It's day 194
since Wildfire was declared

476
00:36:42,122 --> 00:36:45,334
and 63 days since the disease
abruptly went global.

477
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:48,295
There's no clinical progress to report.

478
00:36:53,216 --> 00:36:54,968
Item-- I finally got the scrubbers

479
00:36:55,135 --> 00:36:56,470
in the east sector
shut down to save power.

480
00:36:56,637 --> 00:36:57,929
Wish I could have
done it a month ago,

481
00:36:58,096 --> 00:36:59,472
but it took me that long
to figure it out.

482
00:36:59,639 --> 00:37:01,057
Too bad I never studied
engineering.

483
00:37:01,223 --> 00:37:02,642
Could have saved
a lot of amps.

484
00:37:02,808 --> 00:37:05,811
Item-- I'm still not sleeping well.

485
00:37:05,978 --> 00:37:08,648
Can't seem
to keep regular hours.

486
00:37:08,814 --> 00:37:10,983
Living underground doesn't help,

487
00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:13,152
not knowing if it's day or night.

488
00:37:13,319 --> 00:37:17,907
I'm just feeling
very off-kilter these days.

489
00:37:21,868 --> 00:37:23,328
( beeping )

490
00:37:25,163 --> 00:37:26,498
- ( beeps )
- ( door hisses )

491
00:37:26,665 --> 00:37:28,792
( classical score playing )

492
00:37:38,343 --> 00:37:40,135
( beeps )

493
00:38:02,574 --> 00:38:06,327
( computer beeps )

494
00:38:25,471 --> 00:38:27,431
( alarm blaring )

495
00:38:29,725 --> 00:38:31,393
Computer voice:
Alert status.

496
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:34,229
Air qualifiers indicate
corrosive fumes.

497
00:38:34,396 --> 00:38:36,648
All personnel
must clear the room.

498
00:38:36,815 --> 00:38:40,318
Corrosive element is
deemed poisonous if inhaled.

499
00:38:56,001 --> 00:38:57,877
All personnel clear.

500
00:38:58,043 --> 00:39:01,255
- Full decontamination in effect.
- No!

501
00:39:12,308 --> 00:39:15,060
Full decontamination complete.

502
00:39:20,566 --> 00:39:23,319
The TS-19 samples are gone.

503
00:39:23,486 --> 00:39:26,697
The tragedy of their loss
cannot be overstated.

504
00:39:29,116 --> 00:39:31,619
They were
our freshest samples by far.

505
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:35,872
None of the other samples
we gathered even came close.

506
00:39:37,290 --> 00:39:39,375
Those are necrotic,

507
00:39:39,542 --> 00:39:42,462
useless dead flesh.

508
00:39:47,509 --> 00:39:49,928
I don't even know
why I'm talking to you.

509
00:39:52,806 --> 00:39:54,849
I bet there isn't
a single son of a bitch

510
00:39:55,016 --> 00:39:57,268
out there still listening, is there?

511
00:40:00,897 --> 00:40:03,106
Is there?

512
00:40:05,984 --> 00:40:07,652
Fine.

513
00:40:07,819 --> 00:40:10,446
Saves me the embarrassment.

514
00:40:16,702 --> 00:40:19,205
I think tomorrow
I'm gonna blow my brains out.

515
00:40:21,998 --> 00:40:23,834
I haven't decided.

516
00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:28,296
But tonight,

517
00:40:28,463 --> 00:40:30,674
I'm getting drunk.

518
00:40:32,342 --> 00:40:34,678
( pouring drink )

519
00:40:39,266 --> 00:40:41,058
Speaking of which,

520
00:40:41,225 --> 00:40:43,686
how far do you think
I can chuck this, huh?

521
00:40:45,186 --> 00:40:46,770
Pretty far I bet.

522
00:40:51,692 --> 00:40:53,192
- ( glass shatters )
- Oh!

523
00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:55,528
It is out of the stadium!

524
00:41:02,577 --> 00:41:04,704
( flies buzzing )

525
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:27,894
( people coughing )

526
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:29,436
( cocks gun )

527
00:41:29,603 --> 00:41:32,898
( Shane whispering ) All right,
everybody. Keep moving. Go on.

528
00:41:33,064 --> 00:41:35,775
Stay quiet. Let's go.

529
00:41:54,586 --> 00:41:56,462
- ( chattering )
- Rick: Keep moving. Stay together.

530
00:41:56,629 --> 00:41:59,422
- Keep moving. Come on.
- Shane: Shh.

531
00:42:02,842 --> 00:42:04,302
- Lori: Carol.
- Rick: Shh.

532
00:42:04,469 --> 00:42:06,179
Glenn: Oh, God.

533
00:42:13,436 --> 00:42:15,605
( alarm beeping )

534
00:42:28,284 --> 00:42:30,912
No.

535
00:42:31,079 --> 00:42:33,164
Rick:
Keep it together. Come on.

536
00:42:33,331 --> 00:42:35,333
Lori:
We're almost there, baby.

537
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:36,960
Almost there.

538
00:42:40,213 --> 00:42:42,131
- ( rattles )
- Shane: Nothing?

539
00:42:45,468 --> 00:42:47,512
( pounds on door )

540
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:49,639
T-Dog:
There's nobody here.

541
00:42:49,806 --> 00:42:51,891
Then why are
these shutters down?

542
00:42:52,058 --> 00:42:53,476
- Daryl: Walkers!
- Lori: Baby, come on.

543
00:42:53,643 --> 00:42:55,937
- ( guns cock )
- ( child whimpering )

544
00:42:58,146 --> 00:42:59,982
Daryl:
You led us into a graveyard!

545
00:43:00,148 --> 00:43:02,317
- Dale: He made a call.
- Daryl: It was the wrong damn call!

546
00:43:02,484 --> 00:43:04,903
Just shut up. You hear me?
Shut up. Shut up!

547
00:43:05,070 --> 00:43:06,989
- Rick, this is a dead end.
- Where are we gonna go?

548
00:43:07,155 --> 00:43:09,115
Shane:
Do you hear me? No blame.

549
00:43:09,281 --> 00:43:11,325
She's right. We can't be here,
this close to the city after dark.

550
00:43:13,786 --> 00:43:15,496
Fort Benning, Rick--
still an option.

551
00:43:15,663 --> 00:43:18,416
Andrea: On what?
No food, no fuel. That's 100 miles.

552
00:43:18,582 --> 00:43:20,166
- 125. I checked the map.
- Lori: Forget Fort Benning.

553
00:43:20,333 --> 00:43:22,377
We need answers tonight, now.

554
00:43:22,544 --> 00:43:24,504
- Well, think of something.
- Glenn: Come on, let's go.

555
00:43:24,671 --> 00:43:27,757
- T-Dog: Let's get out of here.
- Glenn: Let's go. Please.

556
00:43:27,924 --> 00:43:30,385
- ( whirrs )
- Shane: All right, back to the cars.

557
00:43:30,552 --> 00:43:32,761
- Let's go. Move.
- The camera-- it moved.

558
00:43:32,928 --> 00:43:36,432
- You imagined it.
- It moved.

559
00:43:36,598 --> 00:43:39,226
- It moved.
- Rick, it is dead, man.

560
00:43:39,393 --> 00:43:42,521
It's an automated device.
It's gears, okay?

561
00:43:42,688 --> 00:43:44,188
They're just winding down.
Now come on.

562
00:43:44,355 --> 00:43:46,691
- No, just go away.
- Shane: Man, just listen to me.

563
00:43:46,858 --> 00:43:48,776
Look around this place.
It's dead, okay?

564
00:43:48,943 --> 00:43:51,362
It's dead.
You need to let it go, Rick.

565
00:43:51,529 --> 00:43:53,197
Lori:
Rick, there's nobody here!

566
00:43:53,364 --> 00:43:56,242
I know you're in there.
I know you can hear me.

567
00:43:56,409 --> 00:43:59,202
- Shane: Get back to the cars now!
- Rick: Please, we're desperate.

568
00:43:59,369 --> 00:44:01,538
Please help us.
We have women, children,

569
00:44:01,705 --> 00:44:03,707
- no food, hardly any gas left.
- Rick.

570
00:44:03,874 --> 00:44:05,374
- There's nobody here.
- We have nowhere else to go.

571
00:44:05,541 --> 00:44:07,543
- ( pounds on door )
- Shane: Keep your eyes open.

572
00:44:07,710 --> 00:44:10,379
If you don't let us in,
you're killing us!

573
00:44:10,546 --> 00:44:13,339
- Please!
- Shane: Come on, buddy, let's go.

574
00:44:13,506 --> 00:44:14,882
- Let's go.
- Rick: Please help us.

575
00:44:15,049 --> 00:44:16,884
( people shouting )

576
00:44:17,051 --> 00:44:20,137
You're killing us! You're killing us!

577
00:44:20,304 --> 00:44:22,431
You're killing us!

578
00:44:25,016 --> 00:44:27,101
( clangs )

579
00:44:27,268 --> 00:44:29,270
( gas hissing )

580
00:44:37,737 --> 00:44:40,948
( theme music playing )
