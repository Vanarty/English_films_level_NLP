00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:30,930
<i>Thank you. Thank you.</i>

3
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,560
<i>But no, give yourselves a hand
because it was your hard work</i>

4
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:37,570
<i>that gave Yardsham Inlet the best year
in the history of this agency.</i>

5
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:45,150
<i>Before we let all that success
go to our heads,</i>

6
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:48,370
<i>we just thought we should get together
and reconnect with the fundamentals</i>

7
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:49,830
<i>of what actually got us here.</i>

8
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:51,490
<i>For that, I'm gonna turn it over</i>

9
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:54,500
<i>to our resident
poet philosopher of product.</i>

10
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:56,170
The rebel command of brand.

11
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:58,960
He's the guru
who terrifies Madison Avenue.

12
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:02,430
My partner, my better half,

13
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:03,580
Howard Inlet.

14
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:08,760
Love you.

15
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,680
Yes!

16
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:20,860
Oh. What is your "why"?

17
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,910
Why did you even get out
of the bed this morning?

18
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:27,070
Why did you eat what you ate?

19
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:29,360
Why did you wear what you wore?

20
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:31,750
Why did you come here?

21
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:34,390
Other than the fact that
I would fire you and hire someone else

22
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:36,040
if you didn't show up for work, but...

23
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,040
Not that. The big "why".

24
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:42,670
We're certainly not here
to just sell shit.

25
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:45,000
We are here

26
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:46,760
to connect.

27
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:50,390
Life is about people.

28
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:55,350
Advertising is about illuminating

29
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:58,390
how our products and services

30
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,810
will improve people's lives.

31
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:02,690
Now,

32
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:04,570
how do we do that?

33
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,860
Love.

34
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,900
Time.

35
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:10,950
Death.

36
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:16,920
Now these three abstractions
connect every single human being on Earth.

37
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,290
Everything that we covet,

38
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:20,130
everything that we fear not having,

39
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:22,960
everything that we ultimately
end up buying

40
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,000
is because at the end of the day

41
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:27,430
<i>we long for love,</i>

42
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:29,930
<i>we wish we had more time,</i>

43
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:32,680
<i>and we fear death.</i>

44
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:34,760
Love.

45
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:37,100
Time.

46
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:39,970
Death.

47
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:41,940
Let's begin there.

48
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:09,030
How long did this one take?

49
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:11,030
Five days.

50
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:13,530
That's pretty impressive.

51
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:16,030
- Maybe he came back too soon.
- Are you kidding me?

52
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:18,240
It's been six months
of this zombie routine.

53
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:19,610
We can't indulge this anymore.

54
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:22,080
Especially because

55
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,120
we're getting fired by Danworth Financial.

56
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:26,380
<i>What? You're kidding me.</i>

57
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:27,700
- No, Whit, come on!
- I'm sorry, what?

58
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:29,150
But I just talked to them yesterday.

59
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:31,120
I know. Everybody's been doing
their best to cover,

60
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:33,630
but that entire account
is built on Howard's relationship.

61
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,910
Half our billings are built
on Howard's relationships.

62
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,120
This is a disaster. This is a disaster.

63
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:38,380
No. Not yet.

64
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:41,050
We have an offer from Omnicom
for $17 a share...

65
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:42,460
- Oh, come on!
- But they want an answer

66
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:43,810
- by New Year's.
- Shh.

67
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:49,740
Let's be honest,
we're not worth $14 a share

68
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,180
if my partner takes a sabbatical

69
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:53,070
as the local domino champion
of Crazy Town.

70
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:54,350
That's a little harsh, Whit.

71
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,360
I'm sorry, but it's true.

72
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:58,900
Simon, I am empowering you.
Go make the deal with Omnicom.

73
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:01,870
I wish I could,
but Howard controls the voting shares.

74
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:03,320
I'll deal with the Howard part, okay?

75
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:04,540
Just push the papers, Simon.

76
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:09,750
I still don't understand
why Howard got 60% of the voting shares

77
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,010
and you only got 40.

78
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:13,470
Because I needed cash to settle my divorce

79
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:16,600
and Howard did me a huge favor
and let me sell him some.

80
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:20,930
So, if you never had an affair
with some junior creative,

81
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:22,410
we wouldn't be in this situation?

82
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:24,270
Inaccurate and unfair

83
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:26,650
to put it squarely on my shoulders.

84
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:29,280
Well, I'm just pointing out the facts.

85
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:33,110
Oh, my God.
Don't you just love that smell?

86
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:34,660
Wait. Stop.

87
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:36,240
Close your eyes.

88
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,870
Breathe it in.

89
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:41,030
Doesn't that remind you of your childhood?

90
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:43,790
Claire, come here.

91
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:48,380
Come on, I got to tell you something.

92
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:50,580
What?

93
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:54,130
I have been doing something
about our situation

94
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:55,970
that you need to know about.

95
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:57,130
What did you do?

96
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:58,640
I hired someone.

97
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,840
You hired someone?

98
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:03,100
Yes. Look, when Eloise caught me cheating,

99
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:06,810
she used a private investigator
named Sally Price.

100
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:09,050
She's this woman
who looks like a Mormon grandmother,

101
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:11,810
and it makes her very good
at the whole stealth thing.

102
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,230
You hired the woman
who caused your divorce?

103
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:16,400
No. I caused my divorce.

104
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:19,030
Sally Price just documented it.

105
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:22,160
Wow. That was actually enlightened.

106
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:24,870
I have hidden depth. We've discussed this.

107
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,500
So,

108
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:28,290
why did you hire the Mormon grandmother?

109
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:31,300
Because we need to document
what's going on with Howard.

110
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:35,250
We need to show that
he's not mentally fit to vote his shares.

111
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,000
No. We're not really
in that place where we're...

112
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:41,300
We're actually gonna be the people
who would do that to a friend?

113
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:42,640
It's not that he won't sell,

114
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:47,180
it's that he won't even
have a conversation about selling.

115
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:49,970
I try to talk to him, I try to reach him,

116
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:52,620
and it's like I'm not even
in the same physical space with him.

117
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:53,730
He's not there.

118
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:55,860
His kid died.

119
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:58,360
That was two years ago, Claire.

120
00:06:58,650 --> 00:06:59,870
What are we gonna...

121
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:01,950
This is our lives at stake.

122
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:03,950
We're not kids anymore.
You look me in the face

123
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:06,350
and tell me that you're willing to have
everything you've worked for

124
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,490
for the last 10 years just evaporate.

125
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,380
Is this Pl good?

126
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:16,340
She caught me cheating.

127
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,980
Oscar could have caught you cheating.

128
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,550
Who the hell's Oscar?

129
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:20,710
My son.

130
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,850
Oh. That Oscar?

131
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:25,010
This private investigator
isn't gonna find anything

132
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:26,890
that'll pass for moral turpitude.

133
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,720
Not on Howard,

134
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:32,610
but if she can raise concern
regarding legal capacity,

135
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:33,940
then we'll be in business.

136
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:36,520
I do really think that
we are out of other options.

137
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:39,530
You know, he terrorized
the grief counselor for six months.

138
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:43,410
He totally blew off the Ayahuasca shaman
we flew in all the way from Peru.

139
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:46,240
And our...
Our intervention was a disaster.

140
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,700
I just...

141
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:51,620
Look, uh, this doesn't feel right.

142
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,660
I know.

143
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:56,500
But when something starts
with a six-year-old dying,

144
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:58,340
nothing is gonna feel right.

145
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,100
He writes letters.

146
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:23,100
Letters? What kind of letters?

147
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:25,830
This might be the strangest thing
I have ever come across.

148
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:27,820
- You got the letters?
- Oh, yeah.

149
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:29,780
Can we ask you how?

150
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:32,370
Cost me $800

151
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:33,620
to get this cut.

152
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:34,780
And just so you know,

153
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:38,120
it's a federal offense
to steal mail directly from a mailbox.

154
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:40,540
- You could...
- Yeah.

155
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,960
- So, three letters.
- Who are they to?

156
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,470
- Oh, not who.
- What do you mean?

157
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:46,180
Howard doesn't write letters to people.

158
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:47,670
He writes to things.

159
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,710
- What kind of things?
- Time.

160
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:52,880
Love.

161
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:54,470
Death.

162
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,480
The three abstractions.

163
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,760
"Time,

164
00:10:57,930 --> 00:11:00,230
"they say you heal all wounds,

165
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:02,310
"but they don't talk about how you destroy

166
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,680
"all that's good in the world.

167
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:06,400
<i>"How you turn beauty into ash.</i>

168
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:10,080
<i>"Well, you're nothing more
than petrified wood to me.</i>

169
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:13,450
"You're a dead tissue
that won't decompose.

170
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:14,610
"You're nothing."

171
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:16,950
That doesn't prove anything.
We can't use that, right?

172
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,120
No. I mean,
kids write letters to Santa Claus,

173
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,480
it doesn't mean they're crazy.

174
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:22,960
No. This is therapeutic.

175
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,380
It's so sad.

176
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,470
Yeah. Anything else?

177
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,100
Usually after work,
he goes to a small dog park in Brooklyn,

178
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:33,300
even though he doesn't own a dog.

179
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:34,970
Just sits there for hours.

180
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:36,620
Does he write letters to the dogs?

181
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:38,550
Are you serious?

182
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,460
Well, that would be
like the home run, right?

183
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:41,940
I mean, that's what we need.

184
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:44,980
- Does he?
- Not that I saw.

185
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,230
- Okay. What else?
- That's it, really.

186
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:50,110
Goes home to his apartment.
Rarely leaves before morning.

187
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:52,530
No Wi-Fi, cable, phone. Nothing.

188
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:57,830
"You're a dead tissue
that won't decompose."

189
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:20,680
Howard?

190
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:23,180
Hey, it's Claire.

191
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:27,860
<i>I swung by that place down the street
and got you some dinner.</i>

192
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:33,690
<i>It's that shrimp thing you like.</i>

193
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:39,700
Okay, I'm gonna leave it right here,
in case you haven't eaten.

194
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:42,550
Hey, don't keep leaving the food there.

195
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:43,620
He doesn't eat it.

196
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:45,540
Oh, I'm... I'm sorry.

197
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,330
<i>And he's late on his rent again.</i>

198
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:50,120
He doesn't answer his door,
and I don't have a working number for him.

199
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:52,420
Yeah, he doesn't have a phone anymore.

200
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:57,380
Um, how much does he owe?
I'll write you a check.

201
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:59,430
<i>If that's what you want to do.</i>

202
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,550
And, uh, if you're not doing anything
with that shrimp...

203
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:05,890
Broccoli rabe last week was delicious.

204
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:07,410
Here he is.

205
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,460
Hey, where's your stuff?

206
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:12,920
I wanted to text you,
but Mom said I had to call.

207
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,300
Text me about what?

208
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:17,340
But then Barry said
I had to tell you in person.

209
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:19,630
Are we taking life advice from Barry now?

210
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,460
What are...
What are you trying to tell me?

211
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:22,840
I'm not coming to stay with you.

212
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:24,630
I'm going with Barry and Mom
to the Bahamas.

213
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:27,190
No, no. Wait, wait, wait.

214
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,730
Hi.

215
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:32,400
How you doing?

216
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:35,280
Can I get, like, five minutes,
maybe a couple feet

217
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,490
just to have this conversation
with my daughter?

218
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:42,660
Thanks.

219
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:45,070
Honey, I got...

220
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,400
I got all kinds of stuff planned.

221
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:47,610
I got a Christmas tree for us.

222
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:48,660
Then sucks for you.

223
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:49,980
<i>I got us tickets to Hamilton.</i>

224
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:51,370
<i>Then sucks for Hamilton.</i>

225
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:52,910
That's a tough ticket, Allison.

226
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,250
I've already seen it.

227
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:57,430
You did?
You saw that with Mom and Barry?

228
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:59,010
And Odell Beckham Jr.

229
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:00,720
And Odell Beckham?

230
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:02,430
Yeah.

231
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:03,970
He's one of Barry's friends.

232
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:08,180
Why?

233
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:12,170
Why don't you want to spend
the holiday with me?

234
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:13,480
I miss you.

235
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:15,360
Because I hate you.

236
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,270
Because you're a philanthropist.

237
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,610
Because you broke Mom's heart.

238
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:23,030
- Philanderer.
- What?

239
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:26,900
The word you're looking for
is philanderer, not philanthropist.

240
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:28,470
They have a slightly different meaning.

241
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:30,250
Well, you would know.

242
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:31,750
Mmm-hmm.

243
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:37,250
Look, I agreed to tell you in person,
and now I have.

244
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:45,640
Hey,

245
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,520
have a good Christmas.

246
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:04,490
Hold it.

247
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,410
Hey...

248
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:18,500
So, rapid fire round while I got you?

249
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:20,260
Cavs are in town.

250
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:22,090
Christmas showdown at the Garden.

251
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,600
I never give your seat away.

252
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,850
I just go solo, but we could go.

253
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:29,490
Don't even have to talk.
Don't even have to look at each other.

254
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:31,880
We can do just what we're doing right now
and just watch the game.

255
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:33,310
Be like old times.

256
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:36,440
Right, number two.

257
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,880
We're gonna lose the Danworth account

258
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:39,650
because that's always been
your relationship.

259
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:42,030
And they're not feeling the love,
as you might imagine.

260
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:43,190
So that's gonna happen.

261
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,450
Whatever though,

262
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:49,990
because we've got an offer
from Omnicom, and it's real.

263
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,750
17 bucks a share.

264
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:54,160
Please consider it, because...

265
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:55,830
Yeah, yeah.

266
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,300
Because they leave total creative control
and they let everybody keep their jobs,

267
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:02,010
which I know you care about,
because you love these people.

268
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:05,710
Good talk.

269
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:35,960
The Beijing boys are here.

270
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,000
Oh, God. No one wants Chinese coffee.

271
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,210
Well, we're selling it.

272
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:42,050
The Manchurian macchiato. Mmm.

273
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:43,840
What are we casting?

274
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,720
- Cruise line.
- Now, see, that's good copy.

275
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:48,470
"Shed your skin, find your life."

276
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:50,050
Sorry, it's

277
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:52,770
"Life is found when you shed your skin."

278
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:55,480
- Does it really matter?
- Yes, because I wrote it.

279
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:58,480
Oh, well, my Way's better.

280
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,030
- Really? How?
- Yeah.

281
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:01,690
Well... Wait, what is your way?

282
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:03,900
"Life is found
when you shed your skin."

283
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:07,030
Which, you know, kind of hits you here.

284
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:11,280
"Shed your skin, find your life."

285
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:12,740
Hits you here.

286
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,290
That does hit me here.

287
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:17,040
Right?

288
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,200
You can have it for free.

289
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:20,170
Just, wait. Wait.

290
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:21,550
Wait.

291
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,050
- Hey, Frankel.
- Yeah?

292
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:27,930
"Shed your skin, find your life."

293
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:30,180
"Shed your skin, find your life."
Everybody, okay?

294
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:31,340
<i>Got it.</i>

295
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:33,810
She made it better.

296
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:39,890
Hey!

297
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:48,190
No, no, no.

298
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,410
Hey. hey!

299
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:30,020
<i>"And you talk to me
in such tones</i>

300
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:32,820
<i>"as if it wasn't the breath in my lungs
that gave you life."</i>

301
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:34,490
- You're late.
- Sorry.

302
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:36,620
"As if it wasn't a spark in my mind

303
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:38,450
"that gave that life meaning."

304
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:40,790
"Oh, you move your tongue,
you mouth syllables,

00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:42,630
"you echo sentiment.

306
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:44,000
"But you do not breathe."

307

"You speak of spark?

"That is richness.

Hello?

316
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,650
Hi.

317
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:10,410
So sorry.

318
00:20:10,412 --> 00:20:12,012
<i>I literally just
wandered in,</i>

319
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:14,820
<i>and I caught the tail end of that, and...</i>

320
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,830
can I just say that was beautiful?

321
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:19,040
What... what is it?

322
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,070
It's just something
we're trying to put together.

323
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:23,000
I just... I love theater. I see everything.

324
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,650
So when's opening night? I'll be there.

325
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:27,090
There is no opening night
until we get this money together.

326
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:29,300
- You rich?
- Divorced.

327
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:31,470
You followed me from the casting session.

328
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:33,550
<i>- Absolutely, I did. Yes.</i>
- Yeah.

329
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:36,010
<i>I almost lost you,
but the red hat helped.</i>

330
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:39,520
Hey, um, I'm gonna say something
a little impulsive here,

331
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,680
maybe a little crazy,

332
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:43,440
but, you know, uh, I have something
about to happen for me.

333
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:47,940
I'm in the middle of a deal
that if it all comes together,

334
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:49,520
<i>I'd be in a position to help.</i>

335
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:51,530
Well, now wouldn't that be lovely?

336
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:54,200
<i>It would. Be great.</i>

337
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,030
<i>And you, you know, you fixed it.</i>

338
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:59,450
<i>So, we should get you back into casting
if you want the gig. I mean...</i>

339
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:03,080
Sorry, I don't even...
I don't know your name.

340
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,800
<i>- Amy.
- Amy.</i>

341
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:09,300
Okay. Well,

342
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:12,630
I'll be back, Amy. I'll be back.

343
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:15,090
Mmm. And I'll be...

344
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:17,640
Hmm. Sorry.

345
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,140
I was on the stage!

346
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:20,770
I'll be back.

347
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:23,100
You're good.

348
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,980
Well done, you.

349
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:47,960
<i>Apartment next door is vacant,</i>

350
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,370
<i>but the guy down the hall
says he didn't hear anything.</i>

351
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:51,960
<i>Ditto the manager.</i>

352
00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:54,420
Wait, they have a <i>CSI: Cleveland</i> now?

353
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:56,480
<i>- Neighborhood like this...</i>
- It's a new show.

<i>Minding their own business.</i>

355
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:01,680
<i>What's a respectable
neurosurgeon doing in a crack house?</i>

356
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:02,970
<i>I don't know.</i>

357
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:04,760
The werewolves,

358
00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:06,770
they're meeting out front

359
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:08,850
all hours of the night.

360
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:13,440
I heard them. Yeah.

361
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:16,620
I think they're...

362
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:19,400
I think they're voting
on a new head of the syndicate.

363
00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:20,740
But

364
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:24,280
I got a raccoon friend.
He's on the task force.

365
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:26,500
He put a bug out there for me
by the trash cans.

366
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:28,460
We're gonna tape everything they say

367
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:30,960
<i>and we'll bust them on a RICO statute.</i>

368
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,960
I don't know anything about that.

369
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:39,050
Hey, I'm your son.

370
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,680
I know that!

371
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:45,980
Good.

372
00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:52,150
I'll be right back.

373
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:20,340
<i>Okay, I have kind of a wild idea.</i>

374
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:21,660
And I know you're gonna laugh at me,

375
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:23,630
but remember that we're desperate
and hear me out.

376
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:27,600
<i>So, my mom hasn't been totally
in her right mind since her stroke, right?</i>

377
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,520
And I'm always trying to remind her
what's actually going on

378
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:33,100
and correct the, sort of,
daffy things that she says.

379
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:35,180
And it upsets her,
and it really stresses <i>me</i> out.

380
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:36,930
And it was pretty much just awful
for a while.

381
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:39,490
And then, someone said something
very, very wise to me.

382
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:44,620
They said, "Maybe you should stop
trying to force your reality on her

383
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:47,870
"and just...
Just go into her reality."

384
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:49,880
I thought you couldn't
afford therapy anymore.

385
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:51,880
- I can't. It was my Uber driver.
- Oh.

386
00:23:52,450 --> 00:23:54,380
<i>And he was totally right.
Totally right!</i>

387
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:57,540
As soon <i>as</i> I started doing this,
everything got easier, you know?

388
00:23:57,710 --> 00:23:59,710
Our life is like
this improvisational game.

389
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:03,300
She just... She <i>says</i> wackadoodle stuff,
and I respond to it.

390
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:06,890
And, uh, she's totally happy
and I kind of have fun.

391
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:09,460
<i>- And that made me think of something else.
- Mmm.</i>

392
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:11,220
Okay.

393
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:14,060
When I was at FBW,

394
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:16,260
I had this account
for a psycho stimulant drug, right?

395
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:18,240
And they went with some
bullshit generic campaign,

396
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,080
but I kept the Hispanic market.

397
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:21,230
Here, watch this. Okay.

398
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,620
So, the teacher is really stressing.
He's saying, uh,

399
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:25,820
"Well, you talk all the time!
You never listen!"

400
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:27,780
And then here comes the monster.

401
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:29,230
"It doesn't have to be this way."

402
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:31,240
Teacher, "Who are you?"

403
00:24:31,410 --> 00:24:32,880
Monster, "I'm your anger, man".

404
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,040
And the teacher says...

405
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:36,510
"I can't stand you, man.
You dominate my life."

406
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:39,460
And anger says,
"There's a solution, my friend.

407
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:43,420
"Docotrin, say goodbye to your anger."

408
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,470
Do you see where I'm going with this?

409
00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:50,050
- Not really.
- Okay, okay. Look, look.

410
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:54,430
We can't get Howard to deal with this
reality that we need him to deal with.

411
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:57,320
And he's writing letters to abstractions
which makes no sense.

412
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,400
But... But he's doing it.

413
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,820
So, what if we just go into his reality

414
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:04,610
and we get those abstractions
to answer him?

415
00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:07,040
I'm sorry, I... I don't follow.

416
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:11,830
What if Love, Time and Death
show up in person

417
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:14,290
and answer the letters
that Howard's been writing to them?

418
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:18,300
How are Time, Love and Death
gonna show up?

419
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:20,470
Actors.

420
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:24,000
We hire actors to be Love, Death and Time.

421
00:25:24,170 --> 00:25:27,340
They find Howard and they confront him.

422
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:32,520
So, you want us to gaslight your boss?

423
00:25:32,890 --> 00:25:36,060
- Huh? <i>I'm sorry?
- Gas Light.</i>

424
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:37,980
You know? It was a play,
then it was a movie.

425
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:39,860
<i>Gas Light? Oh, my God.</i>

426
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:43,820
Does nobody ever watch anything
longer than eight seconds anymore?

427
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:47,490
What she's saying is
you want us to make him think he's crazy?

428
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:51,250
No, no, no. It's not about
making Howard think he's crazy.

429
00:25:51,410 --> 00:25:55,330
Howard's not in a good mental state,
and we know that.

430
00:25:55,490 --> 00:26:00,750
It's about underlining that fact
so that other people can see it, too.

431
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:05,220
Okay. So you want us to perform
in this intervention,

432
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:08,470
and for that
you're gonna finance our play?

433
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:09,720
- That's it.
- Exactly.

434
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,880
Yeah, we'll finance whatever...

435
00:26:12,050 --> 00:26:13,750
I mean, this looks
like a storage facility, but...

436
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:16,230
Okay. Well, actors. What do we think?

437
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:18,860
- No. No, no, no.
- Oh, no.

438
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:20,020
Listen, listen!

439
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:21,530
We take $15,000 each.

440
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:24,440
<i>- Okay? $15, 000.
- Are you completely out of your mind?</i>

441
00:26:24,610 --> 00:26:26,360
Okay, we'll do it.

442
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:27,900
$20,000, each.

443
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:31,370
Uh-uh! I just... You guys just said 15.
I heard you say 15.

444
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:33,870
- Mmm... I like 20.
- I like 20 as well.

445
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:36,110
Well, 20's just...
I don't know, it's a little steep.

446
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,530
I'm like... I was thinking two.
These guys probably live in Brooklyn.

447
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:40,190
- They pay 600 bucks a month.
- Stop talking. Just stop.

448
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,400
You did a good job pulling them down.

449
00:26:41,410 --> 00:26:43,090
This is horrible.
This is completely wrong.

450
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:46,970
No, Amy. This is the work. This is acting.

451
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:49,380
Did you not hear them say
that this man's lost his child?

452
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:53,020
Yes. And that's why he's reaching out
to the cosmos for answers.

453
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:56,100
Well, we get to be that cosmos.

454
00:26:56,260 --> 00:27:00,390
Okay, so you want us to manipulate
this guy's pain so that, what?

455
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:02,430
What, you cash out?
You make a lot of money?

456
00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:04,050
- No!
- No, no, no, no!

457
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:05,550
That doesn't sound good
when you put it that way.

458
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,910
- It's a lot more complicated than that.
- Is it?

459
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:09,110
We love <i>this</i> man.

460
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,490
And he's not just a boss, he's a friend.

461
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,330
<i>Howard is a brilliant,
creative, charismatic guy</i>

462
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:16,740
who used to be fearless.

463
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:19,000
He used to love life,
and right now, he hates it.

464
00:27:19,450 --> 00:27:21,950
And you really think
that this is gonna help him?

465
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,590
<i>He lost his child.</i>

466
00:27:24,290 --> 00:27:26,790
And now he doesn't care
if he loses everything else.

467
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,300
We just can't let that happen.

468
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:31,130
We have to bring him back.

469
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:34,090
<i>$20,000 worth it.</i>

470
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:35,530
- I'll pay for it.
- Claire!

471
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:37,770
I'll pay for it. I'll pay for it myself.
I don't care.

472
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:41,110
So, what are the rules?

473
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:44,110
Well, first, we'd have to sign
a confidentiality agreement.

474
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:46,140
And make sure
that you don't talk about it, 'cause...

475
00:27:46,150 --> 00:27:47,430
No, I don't mean the legal rules.

476
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,280
I mean, the rules
of the theatrical device.

477
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:53,370
I mean, do other people see us,
or only Howard?

478
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:56,620
- Yeah, do other people see them, Whit?
- Whit?

479
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:59,530
I guess... I guess only Howard.

480
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:01,700
That's the effect
we're looking for, right?

481
00:28:01,870 --> 00:28:03,340
- Guess?
- You guess? I mean...

482
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:05,140
I'm sorry, have you thought this through?

483
00:28:05,290 --> 00:28:06,670
- Sure. Sure.
- No.

484
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:08,030
- I mean, to a degree.
- No, we haven't.

485
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:10,420
No, we haven't, Whit. Shut up! Like...
We haven't.

486
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:13,510
For instance, what if they go into a bar
and they want to order a drink?

487
00:28:13,670 --> 00:28:14,720
How can they do that if...

488
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,790
Do you see Howard walking
into a lot of bars these days?

489
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,050
Whatever. Doesn't matter.

490
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:19,880
- I mean, what if Howard goes clubbing?
- They're actors.

491
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:22,690
<i>- They need to know hypothetically.</i>
- Okay. Okay. Enough. Enough.

492
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:26,320
We have the power to be seen
by whomever we want, whenever we want.

493
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,200
- How's <i>that?</i>
- I like that, I like that.

494
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:30,010
- I told you they were good.
- I like that, yeah.

495
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:31,300
We should just leave it to them.

496
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,410
Let's move on.

497
00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:33,570
What's next?

498
00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:36,660
Well, Howard wrote three letters
to Love, Death and Time.

499
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:39,870
So, I guess the only question is
who plays who?

500
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:41,960
Casting. Very important.

501
00:28:42,490 --> 00:28:43,710
Love.

502
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,460
Death.

503
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,170
Time.

504
00:28:49,170 --> 00:28:51,510
Great. When do we get paid?

505
00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:21,040
"Dear Death,
you travel with so much mythology,

506
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:24,200
"cause so much pain, inspire such fear.

507
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:26,460
"But you're a paper tiger to me.

508
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:29,750
"You're just pathetic
and powerless middle management.

509
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:32,510
"You don't even have the authority
to make a simple trade."

510
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:35,720
As you can see,
it's not exactly a fan letter.

511
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:38,040
Yeah, well, Death doesn't have any fans.

512
00:29:38,090 --> 00:29:41,560
I don't understand why,
because it's a liberation.

513
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:44,560
Hey, you okay?

514
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,110
Mmm-mmm.

515
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:58,070
<i>He goes to work, and the dog park.</i>

516
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,740
And that's it.

517
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:01,410
Okay. So, here's how I'm gonna do it.

518
00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:03,070
I'm gonna come to him angry.

519
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:05,410
Like, pissed off. Like, we got a problem.

520
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:07,920
No, no, no. Don't do that.

521
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:11,080
He's calling me wood and dead tissue.
He's calling me out.

522
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:12,250
How's he calling you out?

523
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:13,630
Time.

524
00:30:13,790 --> 00:30:16,720
He's calling out Time, and I'm Time.

525
00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:20,430
Look, I don't want
you antagonizing Howard.

526
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:21,930
Do you get that?

527
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:40,120
But the letter only consists
of one word, "Goodbye".

528
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:41,780
Look.

529
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:43,950
"Dear Love, goodbye."

530
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,790
What am I even supposed to say to him?

531
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:49,130
Um, it's...

532
00:30:50,450 --> 00:30:51,900
It's a letter to Love
saying goodbye, right?

533
00:30:51,910 --> 00:30:53,590
- Yeah.
- So, what if you approach him,

534
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:55,250
and you refuse to accept that?

535
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:57,720
You say he can't
get rid of you that easily.

536
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,100
Tell him that

537
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:04,090
we don't get to choose who we love
and who loves us back.

538
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:07,810
Tell him that you're within him,

539
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:11,900
you're within everything,
whether he likes it or not.

540
00:31:12,310 --> 00:31:14,150
And if he accepts that,

541
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:18,030
then maybe... I don't know.

542
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:21,790
Maybe he gets to find his life again.

543
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,550
They grieve.

544
00:32:17,290 --> 00:32:18,920
Dogs.

545
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:22,340
They grieve,
and they fully understand death.

546
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:27,640
You called me a paper tiger.

547
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:30,140
In the letter you wrote me.

548
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:31,850
You said I was pathetic.

549
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:34,730
Mmm.

550
00:32:34,930 --> 00:32:36,190
You don't remember?

551
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:38,570
You went on about middle management,

552
00:32:38,730 --> 00:32:41,860
making a deal, paper tiger.

553
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:46,040
Oh, Howard, it wasn't that long ago.

554
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,330
Where did you get that?

555
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:53,170
- Who are you?
- Who did you write the letter to?

556
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:58,010
I wrote the letter to Death.

557
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,880
Nice to meet you. Charmed, I'm sure.

558
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,180
No.

559
00:33:07,090 --> 00:33:08,090
I know, I know.

560
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:10,430
People write letters
to the universe all the time.

561
00:33:10,590 --> 00:33:12,440
Most don't get a personal response.

562
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:15,940
But you are, because I just wanted
to tell you that you're wrong.

563
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:17,900
I'm not some powerless middle management

564
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:19,400
- just following orders.
- Miss...

565
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:21,940
You see, I didn't want to make
the trade. It was my call.

566
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:24,110
I don't want this. I don't want this.

567
00:33:24,270 --> 00:33:25,910
Now, I don't tell you how to do your job.

568
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:28,990
So, I'd appreciate it
if you didn't tell me how to do mine.

569
00:33:29,990 --> 00:33:32,490
Who's that man talking to?
He looks kind of weird.

570
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:35,830
Don't worry about that.
Sometimes people are silly.

571
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:38,590
You see, they don't see me
till it's their time.

572
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:40,880
Oh, it's okay, Howard.
It's not your time yet.

573
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,590
I just wanted to return this

574
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,470
and clear things up between us.

575
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:51,890
I really am Death, Howard!

576
00:33:57,310 --> 00:33:58,310
He believed me.

577
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,100
I'm telling you he believed me.

578
00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:02,690
- That's amazing.
- I mean, that was spectacular.

579
00:34:02,850 --> 00:34:04,470
Because there was no safety net, you see.

580
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,880
That... That... That was Grotowski.

581
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:08,490
- That was pure Stella Adler!
- Ah!

582
00:34:08,690 --> 00:34:10,650
- Thank you. Thank you for the opportunity.
- Yes.

583
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:11,900
- You are a kind man.
- Oh, not a problem.

584
00:34:11,910 --> 00:34:13,730
- He believed me, I'm telling you.
- I wouldn't go that far.

585
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:15,980
But he needed it.
I could tell. I could tell in his eyes.

586
00:34:15,990 --> 00:34:18,280
Who was that woman and that little boy?
That was incredible.

587
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:20,450
Oh, that was our private investigator
and her grandson.

588
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:22,630
Oh, really?
And did she say anything about me?

589
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:24,670
She said you were good.
She said really good.

590
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,160
"Good"? What do you mean? Good like...

591
00:34:26,170 --> 00:34:28,300
You mean good like cabbage is good,
or what?

592
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:30,510
No, no. She... Great.

593
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:34,180
She said, she said,
"She made the impossible possible".

594
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:36,690
I should be paying you.

595
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:42,360
They told me that Trevor had
packed his little suitcase,

596
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:44,690
that he said he was going home.

597
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,020
I was furious.

598
00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:51,700
But he was sleeping,
so I couldn't talk to him.

599
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:57,500
I mean, what nurse promises
this dying five-year-old little boy

600
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:59,290
he could go home?

601
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,710
He barely had any white blood cells left.

602
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:05,170
He was so fragile.

603
00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:08,510
And who could be so cruel?

604
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:10,760
Who could do that?

605
00:35:12,090 --> 00:35:13,760
So, of course I'm frantic.

606
00:35:13,930 --> 00:35:18,350
I am shouting at the staff,
trying to get to the bottom of it.

607
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:22,270
Well, Trevor finally wakes up

608
00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:24,610
and I go to him.

609
00:35:24,770 --> 00:35:30,900
You know, his little blue suitcase
was still at the edge of the bed, right.

610
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:34,400
So, I look at him and ask,

611
00:35:35,490 --> 00:35:37,540
"Who said that to you, sweetie?

612
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:41,250
"Who said that you could
come back to our house?"

613
00:35:41,870 --> 00:35:43,540
You know what he says?

614
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:46,760
"Nobody, Mommy.

615
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:50,800
"I'm not going back to our house.

616
00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:53,090
"I'm going home."

617
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:02,310
He died four hours later.

618
00:36:18,370 --> 00:36:19,710
Hello.

619
00:36:20,910 --> 00:36:22,160
Hi.

620
00:36:22,910 --> 00:36:25,290
Are you looking
for Smallest Wings Support Group?

621
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:27,800
Um...

622
00:36:28,830 --> 00:36:31,710
- Yes.
- And you are?

623
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:36,930
- Um, Howard.
- Howard.

624
00:36:38,130 --> 00:36:40,390
Come on in. Have a seat.

625
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:54,820
Did you lose a child, Howard?

626
00:36:55,490 --> 00:36:56,830
Yeah.

627
00:36:56,990 --> 00:36:58,490
- Boy or girl?
- Uh...

628
00:36:58,910 --> 00:37:00,000
A girl.

629
00:37:01,950 --> 00:37:03,330
And what was her name?

630
00:37:09,330 --> 00:37:11,550
<i>No, it's okay. Howard.</i>

631
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:14,500
You don't have to answer.

632
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:18,140
You don't even have to talk, okay?

633
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:21,470
You stick around?

634
00:37:22,930 --> 00:37:24,180
Please?

635
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:31,150
<i>Okay.</i>

636
00:37:31,310 --> 00:37:32,860
<i>Thank you so much for sharing.</i>

637
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:34,410
We really appreciate it.

638
00:37:34,570 --> 00:37:35,570
Thank you.

639
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:38,860
Does anybody have anything else
they'd like to say?

640
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:58,380
- So, why'd you decide to come in tonight?
- Hmm?

641
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:02,230
Yeah, I've... I've seen you outside.

642
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:05,230
I was gonna come out one night
and invite you in,

643
00:38:05,390 --> 00:38:07,360
but I guess I didn't want
to blow up your spot.

644
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:09,890
Blow up my spot?

645
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:12,060
- Yeah.
- You didn't want to mess up my jam?

646
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,030
Exactly.

647
00:38:17,570 --> 00:38:18,740
What's your name?

648
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,460
I'm Madeline.

649
00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:24,620
<i>Nice to meet you.</i>

650
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:27,920
<i>My daughter's name was Olivia.</i>

651
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:31,630
She died of a rare form of brain cancer
known as Glioblastoma Multiforme,

652
00:38:31,790 --> 00:38:33,090
or GBM for short.

653
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:35,000
She was six years old.

654
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,760
What was your daughter's name, Howard?

655
00:38:45,930 --> 00:38:47,270
Okay.

656
00:38:47,430 --> 00:38:50,430
Fine. Don't answer.
I'm not gonna torture you.

657
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:51,980
Thank you.

658
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:54,650
- Was it the holidays?
- Mmm?

659
00:38:54,810 --> 00:38:56,740
Why you decided to come in tonight.

660
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:59,700
We get a lot of first-timers
during the holidays.

661
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:02,240
- No, that's not it.
- Then why tonight?

662
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:05,790
Uh, I guess...

663
00:39:07,330 --> 00:39:08,330
I'm, uh...

664
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:12,800
I'm trying to fix my mind.

665
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:16,760
You lost a child, Howard.

666
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:19,350
It'll never be fixed.

667
00:39:24,970 --> 00:39:26,810
I hope you come back.

668
00:40:13,350 --> 00:40:14,350
Hey.

669
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:16,770
Signed contracts
and confidentiality agreements.

670
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:19,230
- Oh, great. Thank you.
- So, did he say something?

671
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:20,690
Who, Howard?

672
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:23,621
- No. Unfortunately, he didn't.
- Oh, he believed it, I'm telling you.

673
00:40:23,690 --> 00:40:25,480
- Oh, that's good.
- Maybe you should send me in again.

674
00:40:25,490 --> 00:40:27,540
Not Raffi. Raffi's too impetuous.

675
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:29,540
And Amy, she's just so emotional.

676
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:31,370
After me, what is there?

677
00:40:31,530 --> 00:40:33,000
Well, he did write three letters.

678
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:35,130
But Death is so much more vital than Time.

679
00:40:35,290 --> 00:40:37,840
- Right.
- Death gives Time all of its value.

680
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,750
Maybe... Maybe I should
play all the parts.

681
00:40:41,210 --> 00:40:44,560
You know the highest margin demographic
is new parents now?

682
00:40:44,710 --> 00:40:46,190
Target actually invented an algorithm

683
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:48,460
to predict when their female customers
were gonna get pregnant.

684
00:40:48,470 --> 00:40:50,720
You said before that you weren't okay.

685
00:40:51,050 --> 00:40:52,400
Are you sick?

686
00:40:55,810 --> 00:40:57,060
I'm sick.

687
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:00,570
You could say, uh, I'm very sick.

688
00:41:05,650 --> 00:41:07,070
You're dying?

689
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:11,080
Everyone's dying.

690
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:16,050
Yeah, but you're doing it now.

691
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:20,930
Simon. Simon.

692
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:24,760
Come on, tell me. Tell me.
What is it? What's wrong?

693
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:27,630
What's wrong?

694
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:30,100
What's wrong is that
I came out of remission

695
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:31,760
two weeks before my son was born.

696
00:41:32,390 --> 00:41:33,640
What's wrong

697
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:37,390
is that I'm running a marathon every day
pretending to be healthy.

698
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:38,810
That's what's wrong.

699
00:41:40,730 --> 00:41:42,200
Have you told anyone?

700
00:41:45,230 --> 00:41:46,410
You haven't?

701
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:49,660
No, just some pushy actress
that I don't really know.

702
00:41:55,330 --> 00:41:57,290
What is it?

703
00:41:57,870 --> 00:41:59,000
It's multiple myeloma.

704
00:42:00,250 --> 00:42:03,590
I fought it when I was 16,
and then again when I was 25.

705
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:07,060
It just never went away.

706
00:42:07,210 --> 00:42:09,810
Instead it regrouped and got stronger.

707
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:14,060
So, the war's over?

708
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:20,270
Yeah, war's over.

709
00:42:22,310 --> 00:42:24,740
Are your affairs in order?

710
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:26,780
My affairs are not in order.

711
00:42:27,530 --> 00:42:29,320
That's why I hired you.

712
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:31,500
It's bad enough that
I'm leaving my family.

713
00:42:31,610 --> 00:42:33,620
I'm not gonna leave them penniless.

714
00:42:36,330 --> 00:42:37,670
He believed me.

715
00:42:38,490 --> 00:42:39,540
Howard.

716
00:42:40,710 --> 00:42:43,000
He believed me.

717
00:42:51,510 --> 00:42:54,480
<i>Hey. Excuse me.
No, don't touch that.</i>

718
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:56,180
I don't understand dominoes.

719
00:42:56,350 --> 00:42:59,690
There's no board to play them on,
or basket to throw them into.

720
00:42:59,850 --> 00:43:01,230
Right. Um...

721
00:43:01,390 --> 00:43:02,990
I think you might be in the wrong place.

722
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:04,860
No, I'm in the right place, Howard.

723
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:10,320
Mmm. Yeah.

724
00:43:11,990 --> 00:43:15,410
"Time, they say you heal all wounds,

725
00:43:15,570 --> 00:43:18,790
"but they don't talk about how you destroy
all that's good in the world.

726
00:43:19,450 --> 00:43:22,460
"How you turn beauty into ash."

727
00:43:22,620 --> 00:43:24,340
Now that's some bullshit, Howard.

728
00:43:24,830 --> 00:43:28,090
If Love is creation
and Death is destruction,

729
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:31,170
I'm just a terrain in between.

730
00:43:32,130 --> 00:43:35,060
You don't understand Time.
No one understands Time.

731
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:38,020
I mean, Einstein came close
when he said I was an illusion.

732
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:39,400
<i>Howard? Hey. Uh...</i>

733
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:40,730
Listen, I'm sure it's a "no"

734
00:43:40,890 --> 00:43:43,890
but Oneida Apparel asked that
you be in the media buy meeting.

735
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:46,780
I'm sorry to just barge in.

736
00:43:48,230 --> 00:43:49,650
Ask her.

737
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:52,570
Go ahead. Ask her if she can see me.

738
00:44:02,910 --> 00:44:04,190
I'm not gonna be in the meeting.

739
00:44:05,580 --> 00:44:07,250
Mmm-hmm.

740
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:08,630
Well, they insisted I ask.

741
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:10,490
<i>I mean, they're probably
gonna fire us, so...</i>

742
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:11,550
Okay.

743
00:44:11,710 --> 00:44:12,840
- Awesome.
- Yes.

744
00:44:13,010 --> 00:44:14,050
Okay.

745
00:44:15,090 --> 00:44:16,430
See you later.

746
00:44:19,350 --> 00:44:21,100
<i>You can have this back, Howard.</i>

747
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:23,110
Why did you write me anyway?

748
00:44:23,270 --> 00:44:24,770
You wrote me because you need me.

749
00:44:24,930 --> 00:44:26,280
No. Um...

750
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:28,280
I don't need anything from you, okay?

751
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:30,490
You all like to bitch and complain.

752
00:44:30,650 --> 00:44:32,490
"There isn't enough time."

753
00:44:32,650 --> 00:44:34,530
"Life is short."

754
00:44:34,690 --> 00:44:36,790
"Oh, here, the gray hairs are coming in."

755
00:44:36,950 --> 00:44:38,790
You know, a day is long as hell.

756
00:44:38,950 --> 00:44:41,830
I'm abundant. I'm a gift.

757
00:44:41,990 --> 00:44:44,170
Even while you're
standing here talking shit,

758
00:44:44,330 --> 00:44:46,800
I'm gifting you, and you're wasting it.

759
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:47,960
On what?

760
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:49,840
I mean, what is this? Huh?

761
00:44:51,670 --> 00:44:53,140
Hey. hey!

762
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:54,510
You know,

763
00:44:54,670 --> 00:44:57,140
I should be the one
that's writing angry letters.

764
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:07,770
That was the worst thing I've ever done.

765
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:09,950
That was the best thing I've ever done.

766
00:45:10,270 --> 00:45:12,950
What was that thing you said
about Einstein in there?

767
00:45:13,110 --> 00:45:16,490
Einstein called time
a stubbornly persistent illusion.

768
00:45:17,780 --> 00:45:19,120
What's that even mean?

769
00:45:19,410 --> 00:45:21,530
Time doesn't go from January to December,

770
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:23,330
or from noon to midnight.

771
00:45:23,490 --> 00:45:25,790
You know, we all just make it that way
in our heads.

772
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:27,670
That's absurd.

773
00:45:27,830 --> 00:45:30,630
Try telling that to a person
who's an hour late to a wedding

774
00:45:30,790 --> 00:45:34,590
or was just sentenced to 20 years in jail.

775
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:36,200
Or someone fighting a baby clock.

776
00:45:38,050 --> 00:45:41,850
We really don't need
to have this conversation, ever.

777
00:45:43,390 --> 00:45:45,190
Anyway. Just...

778
00:45:45,350 --> 00:45:47,980
Yeah, wanted to say great job today.

779
00:45:48,850 --> 00:45:51,020
Just a stubborn illusion, Claire.

780
00:45:51,190 --> 00:45:52,860
You have all the time in the world.

781
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:54,820
You're nine!

782
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:57,700
"You're nine."

783
00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:15,340
Hi.

784
00:46:18,460 --> 00:46:20,310
I'm sorry.

785
00:46:22,430 --> 00:46:24,600
I'm so sorry.

786
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:26,520
Um...

787
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:30,820
You gotta be friggin' kidding me.

788
00:46:30,980 --> 00:46:32,350
I'm eating.

789
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:35,740
You said goodbye, and that...

790
00:46:36,230 --> 00:46:40,240
We don't get to choose
who we love or who loves us back.

791
00:46:41,110 --> 00:46:43,400
And that means you're powerless to me
<i>as</i> long <i>as</i> you're alive

792
00:46:43,410 --> 00:46:45,160
because I'm the fabric of life.

793
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:47,950
I'm within you. I'm within everything.

794
00:46:48,660 --> 00:46:49,710
Howard,

795
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:52,090
if you can accept that, then maybe...

796
00:46:52,250 --> 00:46:55,970
I don't know,
but maybe you get to live again.

797
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:16,360
I completely screwed it up.

798
00:47:17,020 --> 00:47:18,320
I was weepy and apologetic.

799
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:20,320
Well, I think love can be
weepy and apologetic.

800
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:21,740
I think I was better at the end.

801
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:24,500
Hey, hey. I'm sure you were great.

802
00:47:24,950 --> 00:47:26,240
You're sweet.

803
00:47:26,450 --> 00:47:27,450
Can I kiss you?

804
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:29,250
You don't have to sexualize it.

805
00:47:29,490 --> 00:47:31,920
I can kiss you without sexualizing it.

806
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:34,330
Seriously, I've had sex
without sexualizing it.

807
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:36,300
You should take "sweet", Whit.

808
00:47:36,790 --> 00:47:38,040
It's a promotion.

809
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:41,220
"Irresistible" would be a promotion.

810
00:47:42,170 --> 00:47:43,170
He believes it.

811
00:47:43,340 --> 00:47:44,680
How could you tell?

812
00:47:46,050 --> 00:47:47,600
I could tell by his eyes.

813
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:50,770
That's great, but no one else has seen it

814
00:47:50,930 --> 00:47:52,890
and that's ultimately
what we need to have happen.

815
00:47:52,980 --> 00:47:56,150
We think if you would engage with him

816
00:47:56,310 --> 00:47:59,160
<i>- one more time, um, in public.</i>
- Great. Mmm-hmm.

817
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:00,990
<i>But this time try to...</i>

818
00:48:01,150 --> 00:48:03,650
<i>But you need to provoke</i>
a <i>strong visible reaction.</i>

819
00:48:03,820 --> 00:48:04,820
Why?

820
00:48:05,030 --> 00:48:08,000
Because our private investigator's
gonna capture it on video.

821
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:09,320
And we're gonna use it as evidence.

822
00:48:09,330 --> 00:48:10,570
It'll be like being in a movie.

823
00:48:11,660 --> 00:48:13,060
Except you'll be digitally removed.

824
00:48:13,790 --> 00:48:14,790
No.

825
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:16,170
Sorry?

826
00:48:16,330 --> 00:48:17,500
This is too intense.

827
00:48:17,710 --> 00:48:19,330
Um, I'm sorry. I can't be a part of this.

828
00:48:19,340 --> 00:48:22,180
Amy, there is no "too intense" in acting.

829
00:48:22,340 --> 00:48:25,430
Do you wanna be loved
or do you wanna make an impact?

830
00:48:25,590 --> 00:48:28,010
I mean, this isn't Noél Coward.

831
00:48:28,180 --> 00:48:29,600
This is... This is Chekhov.

832
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:31,010
This is horrible!

833
00:48:31,510 --> 00:48:34,310
The... You know,

834
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:37,650
you did start the agency
with him, didn't you, Whit?

835
00:48:37,810 --> 00:48:39,280
<i>And, Claire, he was your mentor.</i>

836
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:42,160
<i>And, Simon, he gave you part
ownership in a business</i>

837
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:43,940
<i>when he absolutely didn't have to.</i>

838
00:48:44,110 --> 00:48:45,850
- I may have told her a few things...
- Mmm-hmm.

839
00:48:45,860 --> 00:48:47,030
- When we were...
- Mmm-hmm.

840
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:48,520
<i>I'm sorry, this is horrible.</i>

841
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:50,860
I... I can't...
No, I can't be a part of this. Thank you.

842
00:48:50,870 --> 00:48:51,910
- Sorry. Thanks.
- Amy, no.

843
00:48:52,030 --> 00:48:53,040
Amy.

844
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:54,200
Amy. No.

845
00:48:54,370 --> 00:48:55,730
Oh, she's so passionate, you know.

846
00:48:55,870 --> 00:48:56,870
Amy!

847
00:48:57,210 --> 00:48:58,960
I'm so sorry. She will be back.

848
00:48:59,130 --> 00:49:01,130
But if she isn't, um,

849
00:49:01,290 --> 00:49:04,390
I'll step in. I do know all about love.

850
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:07,060
<i>Amy!</i>

851
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:14,810
What'd I miss?

852
00:49:17,350 --> 00:49:19,400
People crying because their kids died.

853
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:21,610
Hmm. Uh...

854
00:49:22,770 --> 00:49:26,900
Uh, there's a thing called
bereavement hallucinations.

855
00:49:27,190 --> 00:49:28,200
Yes.

856
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:29,620
<i>Right. Um. Okay.</i>

857
00:49:29,820 --> 00:49:32,200
So, uh...

858
00:49:32,410 --> 00:49:34,000
I looked them up.

859
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:36,660
And here's the thing. I don't sleep.

860
00:49:36,870 --> 00:49:37,870
Okay.

861
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:39,920
Like, not a lot.

862
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:41,580
I mean, I sleep.

863
00:49:42,250 --> 00:49:43,420
Mmm.

864
00:49:44,250 --> 00:49:48,600
But I get six or seven hours a week.

865
00:49:49,090 --> 00:49:51,060
Now that I think about it,
that's probably why...

866
00:49:51,220 --> 00:49:52,220
Why what?

867
00:49:52,850 --> 00:49:54,060
Um...

868
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:01,950
I'm having conversations.

869
00:50:03,110 --> 00:50:04,400
Mmm-hmm.

870
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:10,030
I mean, conversations.

871
00:50:10,780 --> 00:50:12,120
Okay.

872
00:50:14,910 --> 00:50:17,710
It's okay. Never mind. Um...

873
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:20,130
<i>- Howard?
- Yeah.</i>

874
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:22,830
You wanna have a conversation with me?

875
00:50:24,420 --> 00:50:25,890
Uh, yes.

876
00:50:29,470 --> 00:50:32,470
So, I assume you're a part of the 79%?

877
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:33,810
Mmm?

878
00:50:34,050 --> 00:50:37,900
Of couples who get divorced
after losing a child.

879
00:50:38,270 --> 00:50:39,860
Yeah.

880
00:50:40,100 --> 00:50:41,100
Mmm.

881
00:50:41,310 --> 00:50:42,650
Yeah, me too.

882
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:46,820
Do you still love her?

883
00:50:49,490 --> 00:50:51,990
I don't even know what love is anymore.

884
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:55,000
Do you still love him?

885
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:56,910
We never fell out of love.

886
00:50:57,740 --> 00:51:00,000
At least, I don't think so. It's just...

887
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:02,290
We can...

888
00:51:08,130 --> 00:51:12,510
The day our divorce was final,
he sent me this.

889
00:51:18,010 --> 00:51:20,770
"If only we could be strangers again."

890
00:51:22,020 --> 00:51:23,610
Now we are.

891
00:51:25,190 --> 00:51:27,570
The most romantic gesture he ever made.

892
00:51:28,860 --> 00:51:31,110
So, to answer your question,

893
00:51:31,610 --> 00:51:32,780
<i>Yes,</i>

894
00:51:32,950 --> 00:51:34,370
I still love him.

895
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:44,630
What did you mean

896
00:51:44,790 --> 00:51:46,490
when you said
you were having conversations?

897
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:47,500
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

898
00:51:47,670 --> 00:51:49,640
- Conversations with who?
- Um...

899
00:51:50,460 --> 00:51:51,810
It's not "who".

900
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:53,220
It's really... It's...

901
00:51:53,380 --> 00:51:55,380
You're gonna think I'm crazy.

902
00:51:55,550 --> 00:51:56,550
Try me.

903
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:58,850
Um, can I show you?

904
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:03,230
<i>"Dead tissue
that won't decompose."</i>

905
00:52:04,350 --> 00:52:06,350
He was sitting right here.

906
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:10,900
Just a mean, little, arrogant thug.

907
00:52:11,610 --> 00:52:14,530
And he was the first one
that appeared, right?

908
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:16,910
Uh, no. Death came first.

909
00:52:17,070 --> 00:52:19,830
She met me in the dog park.

910
00:52:20,620 --> 00:52:22,340
Oh, so Death is a "her"?

911
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:26,960
Uh, yeah. It turns out
Death is an elderly white woman.

912
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:30,250
What was the trade?

913
00:52:31,090 --> 00:52:33,640
You said Death wouldn't make the trade.

914
00:52:34,090 --> 00:52:35,090
What does that mean?

915
00:52:35,260 --> 00:52:37,060
When we realized our...

916
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:41,690
My daughter was dying, I prayed, uh...

917
00:52:42,930 --> 00:52:46,900
Not to God or the universe, but to Death.

918
00:52:47,060 --> 00:52:48,780
I offered a trade.

919
00:52:48,940 --> 00:52:50,610
Take me,

920
00:52:50,770 --> 00:52:52,450
leave my daughter.

921
00:52:55,030 --> 00:52:58,950
But she didn't wanna make the trade, so...

922
00:53:17,420 --> 00:53:19,140
<i>So, who won that round?</i>

923
00:53:20,430 --> 00:53:22,230
You or the porcelain?

924
00:53:22,390 --> 00:53:25,310
Porcelain.
Porcelain's undefeated.

925
00:53:27,100 --> 00:53:29,600
I'm sorry about that,
I thought everyone left.

926
00:53:29,770 --> 00:53:31,990
Yes, they did. But I'm here to close up.

927
00:53:32,150 --> 00:53:33,190
Good.

928
00:53:33,360 --> 00:53:34,440
You need help getting home?

929
00:53:34,820 --> 00:53:36,320
No. I'm fine.

930
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:38,450
I'm... I'm good.

931
00:53:40,030 --> 00:53:41,250
I Googled you.

932
00:53:41,450 --> 00:53:42,450
- You did?
- Yeah.

933
00:53:42,620 --> 00:53:43,620
Oh, God.

934
00:53:43,830 --> 00:53:45,670
You came from nothing.

935
00:53:46,450 --> 00:53:48,500
You put yourself through Duke,

936
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:51,000
you married a wonderful woman,

937
00:53:51,170 --> 00:53:52,460
you're a loving father.

938
00:53:52,630 --> 00:53:54,850
So, you lived well. You lived right.

939
00:53:57,840 --> 00:54:00,340
But, my friend, you're not dying right.

940
00:54:02,850 --> 00:54:04,520
Are you gonna tell me how to die?

941
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:06,230
Have you told your family yet?

942
00:54:08,350 --> 00:54:10,520
- Mmm-mmm.
- You're not helping them.

943
00:54:10,850 --> 00:54:13,610
You're just denying them
what is rightfully theirs.

944
00:54:13,770 --> 00:54:15,120
Yeah? And what's that?

945
00:54:15,270 --> 00:54:17,780
Pain? Atrophy? Disease?

946
00:54:17,940 --> 00:54:19,370
Yes. Yes.

947
00:54:19,530 --> 00:54:21,030
All of it.

948
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:23,870
And the chance to say goodbye.

949
00:54:27,450 --> 00:54:28,550
Stick to acting.

950
00:54:36,170 --> 00:54:37,640
Okay.

951
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:40,520
I have something
that I haven't told anyone.

952
00:54:41,260 --> 00:54:44,560
It doesn't involve letters
or angels or anything like that,

953
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:47,020
but it means something to me.

954
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:56,110
They were preparing Olivia to say goodbye.

955
00:54:57,020 --> 00:55:01,120
And my husband was trying to
calm my mother in the parking lot

956
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:03,120
because she lost it.

957
00:55:04,910 --> 00:55:06,710
<i>So I was alone</i>

958
00:55:07,620 --> 00:55:10,540
<i>and I was sitting there
in the waiting room</i>

959
00:55:10,700 --> 00:55:12,670
<i>at Maimonides Hospital.</i>

960
00:55:13,830 --> 00:55:16,760
<i>And there was this woman
who sat next to me.</i>

961
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:21,680
<i>And she asked me who I was about to lose.</i>

962
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:23,640
<i>And I told her.</i>

963
00:55:25,220 --> 00:55:27,270
And she looked at me and she said,

964
00:55:29,180 --> 00:55:31,780
"Just be sure to notice

965
00:55:31,930 --> 00:55:34,110
"the collateral beauty."

966
00:55:36,860 --> 00:55:37,900
I mean, she...

967
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:40,940
She said it so casually.

968
00:55:43,110 --> 00:55:44,860
In the next room,

969
00:55:45,570 --> 00:55:49,080
my six-year-old daughter
was being taken off life support.

970
00:55:50,910 --> 00:55:53,760
And this woman says "collateral beauty".

971
00:55:55,620 --> 00:55:59,380
People don't know
what to say in those moments.

972
00:55:59,550 --> 00:56:02,300
No, she did.

973
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:05,020
I just didn't get it at the time.

974
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:08,850
See, it wasn't said out of
sympathy or awkwardness.

975
00:56:09,010 --> 00:56:11,390
It was from experience.

976
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:16,190
About a year later,

977
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:19,820
something started to
happen to me, you know.

978
00:56:20,110 --> 00:56:22,860
I would be walking
or on the subway, whatever,

979
00:56:23,030 --> 00:56:25,580
and I would just burst into tears.

980
00:56:26,660 --> 00:56:29,450
<i>But these weren't Olivia tears.</i>

981
00:56:29,620 --> 00:56:32,590
<i>These were tears born from something else,</i>

982
00:56:35,870 --> 00:56:40,970
from this kind of profound
connection to everything.

983
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:44,390
And I realized

984
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:49,140
it was the collateral beauty.

985
00:56:52,350 --> 00:56:53,690
I mean, there's...

986
00:56:54,770 --> 00:56:58,020
There's no such thing
as collateral beauty.

987
00:56:58,190 --> 00:56:59,810
<i>There is,</i> Howard.

988
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:02,530
<i>There really is.</i>

989
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:06,540
It'll never bring her back.

990
00:57:06,950 --> 00:57:12,540
And it will never ever make it okay.

991
00:57:14,750 --> 00:57:18,800
But I promise you, it's there.

992
00:57:25,550 --> 00:57:26,890
Okay.

993
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:30,850
You need to talk to them, Howard.

994
00:57:31,010 --> 00:57:32,230
Look, um...

995
00:57:33,180 --> 00:57:34,180
Appreciate your story,

996
00:57:34,350 --> 00:57:37,230
but I'm not really feeling
the "collateral beauty" thing.

997
00:57:37,390 --> 00:57:38,690
I don't care!

998
00:57:39,650 --> 00:57:42,870
Yell at them,
reason with them, challenge them.

999
00:57:43,020 --> 00:57:44,870
Just engage!

1000
00:57:56,660 --> 00:57:58,760
I think this was a mistake.

1001
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:15,930
- Hi.
- Hi.

1002
00:58:16,100 --> 00:58:17,980
What're you doing here?

1003
00:58:18,140 --> 00:58:21,020
Uh, Brigitte told me this is
where I could find you.

1004
00:58:21,190 --> 00:58:22,400
Of course she did.

1005
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:26,440
Could we just go and talk somewhere
for 15 minutes by ourselves?

1006
00:58:26,610 --> 00:58:28,730
I'm... I'm actually working.
I'm rehearsing right now.

1007
00:58:28,780 --> 00:58:30,500
- You're rehearsing here, too?
- Yeah.

1008
00:58:30,650 --> 00:58:32,570
How many projects
are you doing at the same time?

1009
00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:34,370
I'm currently doing three.

1010
00:58:34,580 --> 00:58:35,580
Three. Wow.

1011
00:58:35,780 --> 00:58:36,900
- Yeah.
- That's really busy.

1012
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:38,560
How are we gonna fit a dinner date in?

1013
00:58:38,620 --> 00:58:39,620
Whit...

1014
00:58:39,870 --> 00:58:41,970
Listen, listen, listen. Seriously...

1015
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:47,050
I have to ask you
to reconsider what you said last night.

1016
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:50,010
We need you one more time.

1017
00:58:50,170 --> 00:58:51,520
Just give us one more scene.

1018
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:53,350
I am out.

1019
00:58:53,510 --> 00:58:54,510
Amy, what do you...

1020
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:56,160
Wait, what can I say? What do you...

1021
00:58:56,760 --> 00:58:59,020
I'll give you $100,000. Not 20, 100.

1022
00:58:59,180 --> 00:59:00,780
You don't have $100,000.

1023
00:59:00,930 --> 00:59:02,370
You're right. I live with my mother.

1024
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:05,200
But this is gonna work, and when it does,
I'll have much, much more.

1025
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:06,480
And I'll give you a million.

1026
00:59:06,570 --> 00:59:08,250
- I don't want your money.
- I really will.

1027
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:09,320
I do not want your money.

1028
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:11,480
Do you know,
I've actually never wanted your money.

1029
00:59:11,610 --> 00:59:14,580
What can I say to get you to do this?

1030
00:59:14,740 --> 00:59:17,660
Because there's so much more
at stake here, you have no idea.

1031
00:59:17,870 --> 00:59:19,120
Oh.

1032
00:59:19,870 --> 00:59:21,460
You have a daughter, right?

1033
00:59:21,620 --> 00:59:22,870
Yeah.

1034
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:24,380
Did we talk about that?

1035
00:59:25,330 --> 00:59:28,130
Tell me what it was like
the day that she was born.

1036
00:59:28,300 --> 00:59:29,420
What?

1037
00:59:29,590 --> 00:59:31,640
What it felt like for you.

1038
00:59:32,470 --> 00:59:34,690
Uh, it was scary.

1039
00:59:35,140 --> 00:59:37,100
It was very scary. I was terrified.

1040
00:59:40,270 --> 00:59:42,140
But then they gave her to me

1041
00:59:42,310 --> 00:59:46,310
and I had the most amazing
sensation run through me.

1042
00:59:48,730 --> 00:59:51,580
It... I can't...

1043
00:59:51,820 --> 00:59:52,990
What? Finish it.

1044
00:59:53,150 --> 00:59:55,080
It sounds... It's goofy.

1045
00:59:55,240 --> 00:59:56,490
No, it doesn't sound goofy.

1046
00:59:56,660 --> 00:59:58,570
Do you know, actually,
this is the first time that I felt

1047
00:59:58,580 --> 01:00:00,170
any attraction towards you, whatsoever.

1048
01:00:00,330 --> 01:00:01,800
- Really?
- Yes.

1049
01:00:03,830 --> 01:00:05,710
I looked at her and I...

1050
01:00:08,250 --> 01:00:10,600
I realized that I wasn't feeling love.

1051
01:00:11,670 --> 01:00:13,470
I had become love.

1052
01:00:15,470 --> 01:00:17,970
She doesn't talk to me now, though.

1053
01:00:19,220 --> 01:00:22,730
She blames me for the divorce,
and so she's angry at me.

1054
01:00:22,980 --> 01:00:24,150
And...

1055
01:00:25,270 --> 01:00:26,360
I deserve it.

1056
01:00:27,230 --> 01:00:29,230
I'm gonna make you a deal.

1057
01:00:30,610 --> 01:00:33,530
If you can take all of this,

1058
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:36,490
frankly, aggressive determination

1059
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:41,620
and extraordinary openness

1060
01:00:42,740 --> 01:00:45,670
and use it on winning your daughter back,

1061
01:00:47,750 --> 01:00:48,750
then I'll do it.

1062
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:52,420
It's a deal.

1063
01:00:54,210 --> 01:00:56,810
See, you don't feel that?

1064
01:00:57,300 --> 01:00:58,970
Oh, wow. Give me my hand back.

1065
01:00:59,470 --> 01:01:01,560
You feel that though, right?
You feel it?

1066
01:01:01,720 --> 01:01:03,000
- That's sparks.
- Goodbye, Whit.

1067
01:01:03,020 --> 01:01:04,020
That's what that is.

1068
01:01:55,650 --> 01:01:57,740
Hey! What's up?

1069
01:01:57,900 --> 01:01:59,750
- What?
- You got something to say?

1070
01:02:08,040 --> 01:02:09,510
You got something you wanna say?

1071
01:02:09,660 --> 01:02:11,740
Oh, yeah. I got a lot of things
I'd like to say to you.

1072
01:02:11,750 --> 01:02:13,840
Well, say it. Say it!

1073
01:02:14,670 --> 01:02:16,340
See, you just waste time.

1074
01:02:16,550 --> 01:02:18,510
See, I give you a gift
and you just waste it!

1075
01:02:19,420 --> 01:02:21,970
I don't care about time.

1076
01:02:22,300 --> 01:02:24,020
This is a prison sentence!

1077
01:02:24,220 --> 01:02:26,570
I don't want your gift!

1078
01:02:29,020 --> 01:02:31,190
Because you took hers.

1079
01:03:07,260 --> 01:03:08,730
Oh, come on.

1080
01:03:08,930 --> 01:03:10,430
Are you here to take me?

1081
01:03:10,600 --> 01:03:13,400
No, Howard.
I'm here to ride the F train with you.

1082
01:03:13,900 --> 01:03:14,900
Oh, okay.

1083
01:03:15,060 --> 01:03:19,360
So, there are these two twins
in a womb, a boy and a girl.

1084
01:03:19,530 --> 01:03:20,780
You telling a joke?

1085
01:03:20,940 --> 01:03:22,370
No, no. It's a story.

1086
01:03:22,530 --> 01:03:24,080
So, these twins are happy.

1087
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:26,460
They're fed, they're warm, they feel safe.

1088
01:03:26,620 --> 01:03:28,620
But they're outgrowing their space

1089
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:31,960
and they realize this can't go on forever.

1090
01:03:32,120 --> 01:03:33,750
So they start thinking,

1091
01:03:34,370 --> 01:03:36,300
"What comes next?

1092
01:03:36,460 --> 01:03:39,090
"What if it's cold or lonely?

1093
01:03:39,250 --> 01:03:40,470
"What if we're not together?

1094
01:03:41,050 --> 01:03:43,770
"What if there's nothing at all?"

1095
01:03:46,930 --> 01:03:49,430
So, then the girl looks at the cord.

1096
01:03:49,600 --> 01:03:51,940
This cord that has fed them,
has nourished them,

1097
01:03:52,100 --> 01:03:54,480
this cord that they
can't possibly conceive

1098
01:03:54,640 --> 01:03:56,990
could be attached to anything else.

1099
01:03:57,150 --> 01:03:58,620
And she says,

1100
01:03:58,770 --> 01:04:01,400
"Well, we have no proof.

1101
01:04:01,570 --> 01:04:02,950
"All we have is this."

1102
01:04:04,280 --> 01:04:05,280
No.

1103
01:04:05,990 --> 01:04:07,290
Wow, that's deep.

1104
01:04:07,450 --> 01:04:10,170
So, it's like life after birth.

1105
01:04:10,830 --> 01:04:12,080
Hopeful.

1106
01:04:12,660 --> 01:04:14,160
All right, what do you want?

1107
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:16,420
Why are you here?

1108
01:04:16,580 --> 01:04:18,510
I've heard all of your platitudes.

1109
01:04:18,670 --> 01:04:19,790
I got them, I know.

1110
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:21,340
"She's in a better place."

1111
01:04:21,500 --> 01:04:24,300
And, "this is all
a part of a master plan".

1112
01:04:24,470 --> 01:04:25,640
Heard that one, too.

1113
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:26,970
Here's my favorite.

1114
01:04:27,140 --> 01:04:30,610
"God looked down and
saw the most beautiful rose,

1115
01:04:30,760 --> 01:04:32,640
"so beautiful that he picked it

1116
01:04:32,810 --> 01:04:35,530
"to have it in Heaven all for Himself."

1117
01:04:36,940 --> 01:04:38,990
Then there's the science, biocentrism,

1118
01:04:39,150 --> 01:04:42,490
and we're all living and dying
in infinite universes

1119
01:04:42,650 --> 01:04:44,320
<i>all at the same time.</i>

1120
01:04:44,490 --> 01:04:45,610
And then the religion,

1121
01:04:45,780 --> 01:04:47,530
the Christians and their salvation,

1122
01:04:47,700 --> 01:04:51,170
and the Buddhists and their Samsara,
and the Hindus and their 41st sacrament.

1123
01:04:51,330 --> 01:04:52,830
And can't forget the poetry.

1124
01:04:52,990 --> 01:04:54,370
Oh, the poetry.

1125
01:04:54,540 --> 01:04:57,540
"To die is different
from what anyone supposed

1126
01:04:57,710 --> 01:04:58,880
"and luckier."

1127
01:04:59,040 --> 01:05:00,170
Whitman.

1128
01:05:00,340 --> 01:05:02,510
And, "Rage...

1129
01:05:02,670 --> 01:05:04,470
"Rage against the dying of the light.

1130
01:05:04,630 --> 01:05:08,140
"Though wise men at their end
know dark is right."

1131
01:05:08,300 --> 01:05:10,180
Thomas. And then...

1132
01:05:10,350 --> 01:05:13,900
<i>Row, row, row your boat
gently down the stream</i>

1133
01:05:14,060 --> 01:05:15,860
<i>Merrily, merrily
merrily, merrily</i>

1134
01:05:16,020 --> 01:05:20,520
<i>Life is but a dream</i>

1135
01:05:20,690 --> 01:05:21,860
I got it.

1136
01:05:22,020 --> 01:05:23,320
'Got it!

1137
01:05:24,900 --> 01:05:29,370
It all basically says
that you're a natural part of life,

1138
01:05:29,530 --> 01:05:33,410
we shouldn't hate you,
we shouldn't fear you.

1139
01:05:33,580 --> 01:05:36,330
I guess we should just accept you, right?

1140
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:37,920
That's it?

1141
01:05:39,370 --> 01:05:41,500
I get it. Here's the thing.

1142
01:05:42,380 --> 01:05:45,180
It's all a bunch of intellectual bullshit

1143
01:05:47,010 --> 01:05:50,060
because she's not here
holding my fucking hand.

1144
01:05:59,140 --> 01:06:01,860
<i>Oh, Lord, what</i> a <i>beautiful city</i>

1145
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:09,080
<i>Oh, Lord, what a beautiful city</i>

1146
01:06:09,240 --> 01:06:12,370
<i>Twelve gates to the city</i>

1147
01:06:12,530 --> 01:06:13,580
<i>Hallelujah</i>

1148
01:06:13,740 --> 01:06:16,250
<i>Amen, amen</i>

1149
01:06:16,410 --> 01:06:17,910
<i>Who are all those children</i>

1150
01:06:19,750 --> 01:06:23,130
<i>All dressed up in white</i>

1151
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:26,260
Hi, Howard.

1152
01:06:30,300 --> 01:06:31,770
You gonna cry again?

1153
01:06:32,300 --> 01:06:33,540
You don't like it when I'm sad?

1154
01:06:33,680 --> 01:06:35,900
- Ah, aren't you always sad?
- No.

1155
01:06:36,060 --> 01:06:37,810
No, I can be other things. I can be happy.

1156
01:06:37,970 --> 01:06:41,100
- I can be unexpected and unpredictable...
- Huh.

1157
01:06:41,270 --> 01:06:43,610
And sexy and warm and mysterious and...

1158
01:06:44,900 --> 01:06:46,620
And home.

1159
01:06:46,780 --> 01:06:49,030
I can be home, Howard, you remember?

1160
01:06:49,610 --> 01:06:50,780
Do you remember me?

1161
01:06:51,990 --> 01:06:54,790
Listen. All the "fabric of life" bullshit,
save that for somebody else.

1162
01:06:54,910 --> 01:06:55,960
It's not bullshit.

1163
01:06:56,160 --> 01:06:58,750
I know you don't believe me,
but you have to trust me.

1164
01:06:58,950 --> 01:07:00,130
Trust you?

1165
01:07:00,620 --> 01:07:01,970
- Trust you?
- Yes!

1166
01:07:02,120 --> 01:07:03,920
I did trust you!

1167
01:07:04,830 --> 01:07:06,430
And you betrayed me!

1168
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:10,470
I saw you every day in her eyes,

1169
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:13,770
and I heard you in her voice
when she laughed,

1170
01:07:13,930 --> 01:07:17,310
and I felt you inside of me
when she called me "Daddy".

1171
01:07:17,470 --> 01:07:20,100
And you betrayed me!

1172
01:07:21,140 --> 01:07:23,270
You broke my heart.

1173
01:07:24,350 --> 01:07:25,610
No.

1174
01:07:26,820 --> 01:07:28,820
I'm in all of it.

1175
01:07:28,980 --> 01:07:30,220
I'm the darkness and the light,

1176
01:07:30,320 --> 01:07:31,820
I'm the sunshine and the storm.

1177
01:07:31,990 --> 01:07:32,990
Yes, you're right.

1178
01:07:33,150 --> 01:07:34,830
I was there in her laugh,

1179
01:07:35,490 --> 01:07:38,960
but I'm also here now in your pain.

1180
01:07:39,950 --> 01:07:43,050
I'm the reason for everything.

1181
01:07:43,210 --> 01:07:45,460
I am the only "why".

1182
01:07:47,210 --> 01:07:49,510
Don't try and live without me, Howard.

1183
01:07:50,630 --> 01:07:52,100
Please don't.

1184
01:08:36,260 --> 01:08:37,850
The deal with Omnicom's almost done.

1185
01:08:38,550 --> 01:08:39,850
What about Howard?

1186
01:08:40,010 --> 01:08:41,420
Well, they're aware of the situation

1187
01:08:41,430 --> 01:08:44,400
but we still have to prove
that Howard's ability to vote

1188
01:08:45,060 --> 01:08:46,060
is, uh, compromised.

1189
01:08:46,520 --> 01:08:48,400
I can't believe it's come down to this.

1190
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:50,030
<i>Yeah, well, believe it.</i>

1191
01:08:50,570 --> 01:08:53,280
We have a competency meeting
with the board set for Thursday.

1192
01:09:00,700 --> 01:09:03,870
<i>We're here to give you
a chance to explain this.</i>

1193
01:09:06,920 --> 01:09:09,090
<i>Howard, what are you doing in this video?</i>

1194
01:09:09,250 --> 01:09:12,470
<i>I do not care about time.</i>

1195
01:09:13,550 --> 01:09:15,590
<i>This is a prison sentence!</i>

1196
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:19,140
<i>I don't want your gift!</i>

1197
01:09:19,300 --> 01:09:20,780
<i>What are you doing, Howard?</i>

1198
01:09:21,640 --> 01:09:23,440
<i>Because you took hers.</i>

1199
01:09:24,470 --> 01:09:25,650
Howard?

1200
01:09:25,810 --> 01:09:27,480
<i>You gonna cry again?</i>

1201
01:09:28,270 --> 01:09:30,400
<i>Aren't you always sad?</i>

1202
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:31,660
What about here?

1203
01:09:31,810 --> 01:09:33,770
<i>Listen.
All the “fabric of life" bullshit,</i>

1204
01:09:33,820 --> 01:09:35,360
<i>save that for somebody else.</i>

1205
01:09:40,240 --> 01:09:41,460
<i>Trust you?</i>

1206
01:09:42,240 --> 01:09:43,740
<i>Trust you?</i>

1207
01:09:44,740 --> 01:09:46,000
<i>I did trust you!</i>

1208
01:09:47,080 --> 01:09:49,250
<i>I committed everything to you</i>

1209
01:09:49,420 --> 01:09:51,340
<i>and you betrayed me!</i>

1210
01:09:53,250 --> 01:09:56,470
<i>I saw you every day in her eyes,</i>

1211
01:09:57,470 --> 01:10:01,440
<i>and I heard you in her voice
when she laughed.</i>

1212
01:10:02,260 --> 01:10:03,460
<i>And I felt you inside of me...</i>

1213
01:10:03,470 --> 01:10:04,470
Howard?

1214
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:06,110
<i>When she called me "Daddy".</i>

1215
01:10:06,270 --> 01:10:07,270
Howard?

1216
01:10:07,430 --> 01:10:08,650
<i>You broke my heart.</i>

1217
01:10:08,810 --> 01:10:11,940
Howard, I need you to answer me.
Who are you shouting at here?

1218
01:10:12,110 --> 01:10:14,380
<i>I've heard all of your platitudes.
I got them, I know.</i>

1219
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:16,990
Um, it's not "who".

1220
01:10:17,150 --> 01:10:18,730
<i>And, "This is all
a part of a master plan".</i>

1221
01:10:18,740 --> 01:10:19,860
<i>I'm sorry, what?</i>

1222
01:10:20,110 --> 01:10:21,110
<i>I got it.</i>

1223
01:10:21,280 --> 01:10:23,630
Howard, did you say something?

1224
01:10:23,780 --> 01:10:26,160
I'm not talking to people.

1225
01:10:26,330 --> 01:10:29,960
Well, that's obvious.
Who are you talking to?

1226
01:10:34,290 --> 01:10:35,530
Howard, who are you talking to?

1227
01:10:35,670 --> 01:10:37,890
That's enough. It's enough.

1228
01:10:38,050 --> 01:10:39,720
Thank you.

1229
01:10:40,340 --> 01:10:41,810
You made the point, I think.

1230
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:44,730
Just turn it off.

1231
01:10:56,730 --> 01:10:58,990
You hired people to follow me?

1232
01:10:59,900 --> 01:11:01,370
Make video?

1233
01:11:01,530 --> 01:11:03,700
No, that wasn't the initial intention.

1234
01:11:03,870 --> 01:11:05,490
No, we did.

1235
01:11:06,200 --> 01:11:07,200
Yeah, we did.

1236
01:11:07,370 --> 01:11:09,450
We did a lot more than that, Howard.

1237
01:11:10,330 --> 01:11:12,050
<i>Howard, I'm so sorry.</i>

1238
01:11:12,210 --> 01:11:13,550
<i>We felt like...</i>

1239
01:11:13,710 --> 01:11:15,010
<i>We didn't know what else to do.</i>

1240
01:11:15,170 --> 01:11:17,590
- Claire.
<i>- No. I can't do</i> this anymore.

1241
01:11:17,920 --> 01:11:20,170
I can't do this anymore, Whit.

1242
01:11:20,840 --> 01:11:22,060
Listen, I really...

1243
01:11:22,220 --> 01:11:24,060
I didn't even think that
it was gonna work.

1244
01:11:24,220 --> 01:11:26,180
- Really, honestly, I...
- Claire. Claire. Claire.

1245
01:11:26,220 --> 01:11:27,940
I'm so sorry.

1246
01:11:28,350 --> 01:11:30,470
- All right, all right, all right.
- Howard...

1247
01:11:33,060 --> 01:11:37,070
I'm obviously not
in the right state of mind.

1248
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:41,540
Maybe none of us are.

1249
01:11:41,690 --> 01:11:43,700
You think I haven't noticed?

1250
01:11:48,080 --> 01:11:49,700
I mean, Claire,

1251
01:11:49,870 --> 01:11:54,120
you dedicated
your entire life to this agency.

1252
01:11:54,290 --> 01:11:56,090
<i>You made us your family</i>

1253
01:11:56,250 --> 01:11:58,590
<i>when you could have been
starting your own.</i>

1254
01:11:59,920 --> 01:12:02,270
And, uh, you've been
absolutely killing yourself,

1255
01:12:02,420 --> 01:12:03,890
covering for me,

1256
01:12:04,300 --> 01:12:05,800
<i>and I appreciate that.</i>

1257
01:12:07,300 --> 01:12:09,810
Thank you.

1258
01:12:11,430 --> 01:12:13,430
And, Simon,

1259
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:16,780
you've done your best
to hide it from everyone,

1260
01:12:16,940 --> 01:12:18,570
but I know your history.

1261
01:12:18,730 --> 01:12:22,160
And I suspect I'm making
an already impossible situation

1262
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:23,950
even worse for you.

1263
01:12:26,570 --> 01:12:28,070
I promise you,

1264
01:12:29,240 --> 01:12:31,750
as long as I am here,

1265
01:12:31,910 --> 01:12:34,660
your family will be cared for.

1266
01:12:36,670 --> 01:12:38,010
Thank you.

1267
01:12:41,420 --> 01:12:42,640
Whit.

1268
01:12:44,840 --> 01:12:46,940
Best friend I've ever had.

1269
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:50,430
But I'm disappointed in you, man.

1270
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:53,150
I mean, not for... Not for this.

1271
01:12:54,140 --> 01:12:55,640
Not for this.

1272
01:12:57,770 --> 01:13:03,150
<i>You don't need her permission
to be her father.</i>

1273
01:13:08,110 --> 01:13:11,210
Allison's the best thing
you got happening in this world,

1274
01:13:11,780 --> 01:13:14,160
and tomorrow's not promised.

1275
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:20,550
<i>Do you hear me?</i>

1276
01:13:25,380 --> 01:13:27,300
You guys did the right thing.

1277
01:13:29,010 --> 01:13:31,480
I want our agency to survive.

1278
01:13:31,640 --> 01:13:33,260
Something should.

1279
01:13:34,020 --> 01:13:35,730
All right, um...

1280
01:13:37,190 --> 01:13:39,190
I'll sign the papers now.

1281
01:13:42,770 --> 01:13:45,490
Your approval of the sale.

1282
01:13:52,580 --> 01:13:54,500
Uh, the other one?

1283
01:13:55,370 --> 01:13:59,040
The one you called me
six times to have me sign.

1284
01:13:59,210 --> 01:14:01,260
Um, I assume you have it here with you.

1285
01:14:07,050 --> 01:14:08,430
I am sorry, Howard.

1286
01:14:25,900 --> 01:14:27,900
This is the right thing.

1287
01:14:29,570 --> 01:14:32,290
I'm telling you, this is the right thing.

1288
01:14:43,540 --> 01:14:46,050
Excuse me.

1289
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:48,760
What was that second piece of paper?

1290
01:14:49,470 --> 01:14:52,890
Howard put some of his ownership
into a trust in his daughter's name.

1291
01:14:54,100 --> 01:14:57,270
It's just a legal certificate
saying she's no longer with us.

1292
01:15:01,190 --> 01:15:04,440
I think I need a drink.

1293
01:16:20,010 --> 01:16:21,860
Are you okay?

1294
01:16:47,540 --> 01:16:50,920
"They say that the time in Heaven

1295
01:16:51,250 --> 01:16:56,230
"is compared to the blink of an eye

1296
01:16:56,380 --> 01:16:58,560
"for us on this Earth.

1297
01:17:03,390 --> 01:17:06,940
<i>"Sometimes I think of Adam running</i>

1298
01:17:07,230 --> 01:17:10,070
<i>"through a beautiful field
of wild flowers.</i>

1299
01:17:18,360 --> 01:17:23,420
<i>"He's so happy,
completely caught up in what he's doing.</i>

1300
01:17:29,250 --> 01:17:30,750
<i>"But then he looks back</i>

1301
01:17:31,790 --> 01:17:34,050
<i>"like he used to do
when he ran ahead of me</i>

1302
01:17:34,210 --> 01:17:36,720
<i>"in airports or malls or wherever.</i>

1303
01:17:42,350 --> 01:17:44,270
<i>"And he smiles."</i>

1304
01:17:44,930 --> 01:17:45,930
Jesus.

1305
01:17:46,100 --> 01:17:50,110
<i>"Because the blink of his eye
was the rest of my life</i>

1306
01:17:52,150 --> 01:17:54,570
"and I'm right there behind him."

1307
01:17:58,900 --> 01:18:01,000
Anyway, it's a first draft.

1308
01:18:02,950 --> 01:18:04,450
It's beautiful.

1309
01:18:05,200 --> 01:18:06,750
Really beautiful.

1310
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,300
<i>Does anybody else wanna say anything?</i>

1311
01:18:12,790 --> 01:18:15,890
<i>Okay, I guess that's all for tonight.</i>

1312
01:18:19,590 --> 01:18:21,010
<i>Thank you.</i>

1313
01:18:47,370 --> 01:18:48,710
Sorry, sorry.-

1314
01:18:50,620 --> 01:18:51,620
Yo!

1315
01:18:51,790 --> 01:18:53,950
I can't believe you made me
come into this neighborhood

1316
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,130
carrying $20,000 in cash.

1317
01:18:56,670 --> 01:18:58,170
What are you gonna do with it?

1318
01:18:58,340 --> 01:19:00,180
You should put it aside for acting school.

1319
01:19:00,340 --> 01:19:01,560
You were really good.

1320
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:03,970
Mmm. I'm gonna use it
to buy designer drugs.

1321
01:19:04,300 --> 01:19:05,850
Or that, too.

1322
01:19:06,010 --> 01:19:07,110
<i>Yeah.</i>

1323
01:19:10,770 --> 01:19:13,190
Hey, you gonna make a good mom one day.

1324
01:19:17,480 --> 01:19:18,700
Yeah?

1325
01:19:18,980 --> 01:19:21,860
Yeah, well,
that's pretty much not in the cards.

1326
01:19:22,030 --> 01:19:24,250
I decided against the science

1327
01:19:24,740 --> 01:19:27,990
and it seems time
finally caught up with me.

1328
01:19:29,620 --> 01:19:33,590
<i>There was this dust dealer up on
187th who gave me</i> Brave <i>New World.</i>

1329
01:19:33,960 --> 01:19:36,300
That book turned hours into seconds.

1330
01:19:36,460 --> 01:19:38,130
He was my father.

1331
01:19:38,300 --> 01:19:39,760
And there was this homeless woman

1332
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:42,020
who lived under
the University Heights bridge.

1333
01:19:42,170 --> 01:19:43,350
Her name was Flora.

1334
01:19:43,550 --> 01:19:46,900
She was batshit crazy,
but she told me the greatest stories.

1335
01:19:47,300 --> 01:19:48,310
She was my mother.

1336
01:19:49,970 --> 01:19:51,400
<i>See, Claire,</i>

1337
01:19:52,430 --> 01:19:54,690
<i>your children don't have to come from you.</i>

1338
01:19:54,850 --> 01:19:56,400
<i>They go through you.</i>

1339
01:19:59,230 --> 01:20:02,530
So, I wouldn't consider
the battle with time over just yet.

1340
01:20:02,780 --> 01:20:05,410
I thought time wasn't linear.

1341
01:20:05,570 --> 01:20:07,000
I thought it was an illusion.

1342
01:20:08,490 --> 01:20:11,590
Maybe
that was just bullshit, Claire.

1343
01:20:12,540 --> 01:20:15,710
Maybe that was just acting.

1344
01:20:45,740 --> 01:20:48,120
- Hey, Allison.
- Come on, let's go.

1345
01:20:48,700 --> 01:20:50,420
Oh. Come on. Allison!

1346
01:20:50,950 --> 01:20:52,450
I'll meet you guys there.

1347
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:56,970
I don't wanna talk to you. You know that.

1348
01:20:57,210 --> 01:20:58,210
Leave me alone.

1349
01:20:58,380 --> 01:20:59,630
No. I won't leave you alone.

1350
01:20:59,790 --> 01:21:01,050
- No?
- No.

1351
01:21:01,250 --> 01:21:03,630
I know you're angry at me,
and that's okay.

1352
01:21:03,800 --> 01:21:04,800
I can take it.

1353
01:21:04,970 --> 01:21:08,470
But we gotta talk about it
because that's what you do in a family.

1354
01:21:08,640 --> 01:21:12,140
So I'm gonna come here every day
and embarrass you in front of your friends

1355
01:21:12,310 --> 01:21:13,350
until you talk to me.

1356
01:21:13,640 --> 01:21:14,940
So you're gonna stalk me?

1357
01:21:15,140 --> 01:21:16,820
Well... Yes, basically.

1358
01:21:16,980 --> 01:21:18,300
Well, what if I get a restraining order?

1359
01:21:18,310 --> 01:21:19,970
Well, I don't think you're
gonna be able to do that.

1360
01:21:19,980 --> 01:21:21,320
Well, I'll get Mom to pay for it.

1361
01:21:21,480 --> 01:21:23,330
Well, for your information, they're free.

1362
01:21:23,480 --> 01:21:25,160
Well, then I'll get you to pay for it.

1363
01:21:28,990 --> 01:21:30,240
I really love you.

1364
01:21:31,660 --> 01:21:33,290
Mom says you butcher that word.

1365
01:21:33,540 --> 01:21:35,250
Not when I say it to you.

1366
01:21:35,790 --> 01:21:37,210
<i>Look...</i>

1367
01:21:37,370 --> 01:21:40,340
<i>I can't fly you to Maine for lunch</i>

1368
01:21:40,670 --> 01:21:41,920
<i>or get you picked up in a Tesla</i>

1369
01:21:42,090 --> 01:21:44,340
<i>and take you to your internship
with Anna Wintour</i>

1370
01:21:44,510 --> 01:21:46,760
or whatever the hell
they do in this neighborhood.

1371
01:21:49,470 --> 01:21:51,850
But I think that you and me
can sit on a park bench

1372
01:21:52,010 --> 01:21:53,940
and tell jokes
and have a pretty good time.

1373
01:21:54,970 --> 01:21:58,400
I can't believe
you're gonna stalk me.

1374
01:22:02,360 --> 01:22:03,570
But, um...

1375
01:22:04,480 --> 01:22:06,860
Just so you know, tomorrow's a half-day.

1376
01:22:08,240 --> 01:22:09,860
Well, I'll be here then.

1377
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:30,850
Hey.

1378
01:22:33,890 --> 01:22:35,430
Here you are.

1379
01:22:37,140 --> 01:22:41,110
I've been waiting a long time
for my moment for validation,

1380
01:22:41,270 --> 01:22:42,400
and this was it.

1381
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:46,160
An audience of one,
in secret, with no applause.

1382
01:22:55,620 --> 01:22:56,620
I told my wife.

1383
01:22:57,080 --> 01:22:58,580
Oh, how did it go?

1384
01:22:58,910 --> 01:23:00,160
She knew.

1385
01:23:01,080 --> 01:23:03,210
She's getting ready for it.

1386
01:23:07,880 --> 01:23:10,600
You know, when I was younger,
I used to think,

1387
01:23:12,430 --> 01:23:14,430
you really wanna live to be 100 years old?

1388
01:23:15,010 --> 01:23:16,940
You know, like a shriveled up raisin.

1389
01:23:18,810 --> 01:23:20,430
And the answer to that now

1390
01:23:21,190 --> 01:23:22,650
is yes.

1391
01:23:24,230 --> 01:23:26,230
Because my son would be 70,

1392
01:23:26,940 --> 01:23:28,440
his son would be 40,

1393
01:23:28,610 --> 01:23:30,410
and his son would be 10.

1394
01:23:32,110 --> 01:23:34,240
And I would be the man, you know.

1395
01:23:34,780 --> 01:23:36,160
Pops.

1396
01:23:38,330 --> 01:23:41,630
Could get used to that, you know.

1397
01:23:43,210 --> 01:23:45,380
See you around, Pops.

1398
01:23:48,090 --> 01:23:50,140
I wish I could be hereto see the play.

1399
01:23:50,960 --> 01:23:53,810
Oh, no, no.
The play is dead after all this.

1400
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:56,600
But you never know,

1401
01:23:56,760 --> 01:23:59,890
nothing's ever really dead
if you look at it right.

1402
01:24:45,350 --> 01:24:46,570
Hey.

1403
01:24:47,150 --> 01:24:48,190
Hey.

1404
01:24:49,270 --> 01:24:50,570
Uh, it's Christmas Eve.

1405
01:24:51,230 --> 01:24:52,700
Mmm-hmm.

1406
01:24:53,190 --> 01:24:55,070
And you're alone.

1407
01:24:55,360 --> 01:24:56,360
By choice.

1408
01:24:56,910 --> 01:24:58,870
Can I ruin that?

1409
01:25:50,080 --> 01:25:51,840
You've been crying.

1410
01:25:53,920 --> 01:25:56,890
I was watching a video
I took of my daughter.

1411
01:25:58,760 --> 01:26:00,760
She's dancing with her father in it.

1412
01:26:03,470 --> 01:26:05,690
Can I show it to you, Howard?

1413
01:26:27,160 --> 01:26:30,090
My daughter's name was Olivia.

01:27:03,620 --> 01:27:06,620
<i>"If only we could be strangers again."</i>

1420
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:11,620
What was your daughter's name, Howard?

1421
01:27:15,340 --> 01:27:16,800
I can't.

1422
01:27:18,920 --> 01:27:20,340
I... I can't.

1423
01:27:37,900 --> 01:27:39,700
<i>Swing me faster!</i>

1424
01:27:41,570 --> 01:27:44,920
<i>Faster, Daddy! Faster!</i>

1425
01:27:54,210 --> 01:27:55,380
Howard...

1426
01:27:55,580 --> 01:27:57,140
<i>I feel like</i> a <i>bird.</i>

1427
01:27:57,420 --> 01:27:59,090
Say her name.

Just make sure you notice
the collateral beauty.
