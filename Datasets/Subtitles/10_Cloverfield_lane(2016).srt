And when I got here,<br/>Howard was closing the door.

346
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:50,878

"No, no, Emmett, you'll never get<br/>a decent job if you do that."

358
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:27,675
Whatever.

359
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,432
Like that matters now, right?

360
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:32,636
T ell you what,<br/>if I had known this was coming,

361
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:36,156
I would've gotten, like,<br/>50 of them. I swear, man.

362
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,675
I would look like a circus freak,<br/>or something.

363
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:40,239
I'd just be covered head to toe.

364
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,595
Tattoos all over my...<br/>You know, everywhere. Face?

365
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:45,592
Sure. Right there. Across my forehead.

366
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:48,674
Just my name. "Emmett."

367
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:50,919
Or, you know,

368
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,478
- "Thug Life."<br/>- (CHUCKLES)

369
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,835
"YOLO."

370
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,069
I don't even know what that means,

371
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:57,673
but, you know,<br/>I hear people saying it all the time,

372
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,000
so, it must be cool. (CHUCKLES)

373
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:04,834
Hey, what about you, Howard?

374
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:10,351
Anything you wish you'd done?

375
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,912
In all honesty, no.

376
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,275
No?

377
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,990
No crazy nights in Vegas?

378
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:26,428
Maybe, uh, take a pilgrimage to Waco?

379
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:31,075
Everything I wanted to do, I did.

380
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,757
I focused on being prepared.

381
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:35,439
And I was.

382
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,519
And here we are.

383
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,958
EMMETT: Oh, my goodness.

384
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,473
Is that Monopoly?

385
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:56,559
There we go!

386
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,517
Yeah, that's how we kill the time.

387
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:00,477
What would you say, Howard,<br/>we're gonna be down here,

388
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,915
what, like, a year? Two? Maybe?

389
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,672
I bet you if we started a game right now,

390
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,432
we might even<br/>get halfway finished by the time...

391
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:08,754
Stop talking!

392
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:10,959
(BREATHES DEEPLY)

393
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:20,390
You don't need to make jokes about<br/>how long we're going to be down here

394
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,948
when nobody knows<br/>how long that's going to be.

395
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,670
Your humor is not funny.

396
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,671
I don't appreciate it<br/>while I'm trying to eat,

397
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:28,800
and neither does Michelle.

398
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:32,271
Now, please shut up<br/>and let us eat in peace.

399
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,149
Hmm.

400
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:01,640
Emmett?

401
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:05,152
Would you pass me a napkin?

402
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,474
Thank you.

403
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:18,075
I know what you're saying.<br/>I never could finish <i>Monopoly.</i>

404
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:21,274
That game really<br/>does take forever, right?

405
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,158
For me, though, it was, um...

406
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,353
<i>Chutes and Ladders,</i>

407
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,029
uh...

408
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,233
<i>Sorry!,</i>

409
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,072
and <i>Trouble.</i>

410
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,754
You know, the thing with the dice<br/>and the thing that you pressed,

411
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:36,558
- what was that called?<br/>- The...

412
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:39,234
BOTH: Pop-O-Matic bubble! Yeah.

413
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,920
Did you ever play that, um...<br/>What was that, <i>Operation?</i>

414
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,274
- Loved <i>Operation!</i><br/>- I'm telling you, man,

415
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,429
I couldn't play that game.

416
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:45,669
- It terrified me.<br/>- Why...

417
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:49,275
That noise that thing would make<br/>when you hit that edge. I mean...

418
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:51,590
- Good Lord!<br/>- (CHUCKLING) It was pretty scary.

419
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:53,680
Could you hand me the salt?

420
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:58,589
Please?

421
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,074
Ah, shoot! I'm sorry.

422
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,198
I'm gonna need the pepper also.

423
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,632
What exactly do you think you're doing?

424
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:18,755
I'm asking for pepper.

425
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,239
Like hell you were! What was that?

426
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:21,713
I don't know what you're<br/>talking about, Howard.

427
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:24,109
Are you trying to insult me?

428
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:28,153
Here, in the shelter that I built<br/>that's keeping you alive?

429
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:31,073
You don't think I see what you just did?

430
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:34,478
Is that how you thank me<br/>for saving your life?

431
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:35,760
- Howard, calm down.<br/>- Shut up!

432
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:38,355
Shut up and stay in your seat!

433
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:46,195
Is it?

434
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,391
Now, let me tell you,

435
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:51,349
I know what a traitor looks like.

436
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,793
Understand?

437
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:59,231
I have shown you nothing,<br/>but generosity and hospitality.

438
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,751
I want you to apologize.

439
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,955
To tell me you're going to behave.

440
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,268
I will.

441
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,273
You will what?

442
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,473
I'll behave.

443
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,797
And I'm so sorry.

444
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:32,640
HOWARD: Sit.

445
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,439
(HOWARD SIGHING)

446
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,279
Ah...

447
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:57,277
Have to stay hydrated.

448
00:39:58,640 --> 00:39:59,709
Hmm.

449
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,710
That's easy to forget down here.

450
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:15,588
What's wrong?

451
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:18,314
(SOFTLY) Nothing.

452
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:30,715

(STUTTERING) It's okay.<br/>I just want to come inside.

475
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:56,990
She looks hurt.<br/>She wants me to let her in.

476
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:59,548
Do not let her in!

477
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:02,393
- Look at her face, Michelle!<br/>- No!

No, no, no!

00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:07,554
No!

Oh, my God, I'm fine. I really am fine.

481
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:13,034
- No, please, I'm okay.<br/>- There's...

482
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:16,237
It really only...<br/>It only touched me a little. A little!

483
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:19,392
So, could you open the door? Open it!

484
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:22,314
- She's begging me.<br/>- You can't help her!

485
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:23,515
No one can!

486
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:25,636
Let me in. I'll be okay.

487
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:28,837
I'll be okay.<br/>It really hardly touched me at all.

realizing they're all gone.

Your accident

509
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:51,758
was my fault.

510
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:57,151
When I found out about<br/>the incoming attack,

511
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:58,952
I got frantic.

512
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:01,759
I knew I needed to get back here<br/>as soon as possible,

513
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:04,115

and

517
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:16,229
I'm the reason you went off the road.

518
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:21,073
I mean, I know I seem<br/>like a sensible guy,

519
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:24,353
but at the time, I wasn't myself.

520
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:29,551
It was an accident, but it was my fault.

521
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:33,672
I was afraid to tell you,

522
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:35,909
and,

523
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:39,433
I'm sorry.

00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:49,668
Um...

525
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:51,352
You should shower.

Even the smallest amount of air

527
