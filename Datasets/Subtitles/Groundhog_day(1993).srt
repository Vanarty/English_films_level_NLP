1
00:00:55,347 --> 00:00:56,848
Somebody asked me:

2
00:00:57,099 --> 00:01:00,351
"Phil, if you could be anywhere,
where would you be?"

3
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:03,146
I said to him,
"Probably right here...

4
00:01:03,397 --> 00:01:06,482
...Elko, Nevada."
Our nation's high at 79 today.

5
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:09,402
In California, they'll have
warm weather tomorrow...

6
00:01:09,653 --> 00:01:12,280
...gang wars and some
overpriced real estate.

7
00:01:12,531 --> 00:01:15,366
In the Pacific Northwest,
they'll have some...

8
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:17,285
...very, very tall trees.

9
00:01:17,536 --> 00:01:20,079
Clear across the Rockies
and Great Plains.

10
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:22,749
But look out, here comes trouble.

11
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:25,960
Oh, boy!

12
00:01:26,545 --> 00:01:28,337
Front coming our way!
Look out!

13
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:32,383
What will that mean to us?
One of these big, blue things!

14
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:36,512
This cold, frigid arctic air,
this big mass out of the north.

15
00:01:37,431 --> 00:01:40,725
It'll meet up with all this
moisture out of the Gulf.

16
00:01:40,976 --> 00:01:43,352
They'll mix at high altitudes
and cause snow.

17
00:01:43,854 --> 00:01:45,062
Going out on a limb:

18
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:49,066
Not gonna hit us here in Pittsburgh.
Gonna push off and hit Altoona.

19
00:01:49,276 --> 00:01:50,359
Close call!

20
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:52,278
Let's look at the five-day.

21
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:55,907
As you can see, nothing to be
too scared about.

22
00:01:56,408 --> 00:01:59,869
Bundle up warm, but you can
leave your galoshes at home.

23
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:02,830
I won't be here for the 10:00.
Tomorrow's Groundhog Day.

24
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:07,585
I'll be in Punxsutawney for our
country's oldest groundhog festival.

25
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:11,047
According to the legend,
tomorrow, February 2nd...

26
00:02:11,215 --> 00:02:13,508
...if the groundhog wakes
and sees his shadow...

27
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:16,594
...we've got six more weeks of winter.
So cross your fingers.

28
00:02:16,762 --> 00:02:17,804
Sounds like fun.

29
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:21,516
You must really enjoy it.
This is your third year in a row.

30
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:23,017
Four, Nan.

31
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:24,310
Four.

32
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:25,645
Thanks, Phil.

33
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:30,566
Next, our entertainment editor
looks at sex and violence in movies.

34
00:02:30,818 --> 00:02:31,901
Stay with us.

35
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:36,030
We're clear.

36
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:38,157
Have fun in Punxsutawney.

37
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:44,163
For your information, Hairdo,
a major network is interested in me.

38
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:47,041
That would be the
Home Shopping Network.

39
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:51,087
Thanks, Larry.
Go wait in the van.

40
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:54,173
That was nice, Phil.
"Big trees"!

41
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:57,343
Stop, Kenny.
Look, can you handle the 10 or not?

42
00:02:57,511 --> 00:02:58,553
Yeah, yeah.

43
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,557
If you don't want to rush back,
I can do the 5 tomorrow.

44
00:03:02,808 --> 00:03:05,768
Stay an extra second in Punxsutawney?
Please!

45
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:08,229
Rita thinks it'd be
a great idea...

46
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,858
...to stay for other events.
You'll get incredible footage.

47
00:03:12,109 --> 00:03:14,443
The people and the fun.
The excitement!

48
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:17,864
You haven't worked with her yet.
She's really nice.

49
00:03:18,073 --> 00:03:21,242
I think she'll be
a really good producer.

50
00:03:21,493 --> 00:03:23,911
You guys are going to have fun.

51
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:29,584
She's fun. But not my kind of fun.
I will be here for the 5.

52
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:30,960
Rita.

53
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:34,482
Can you keep a secret, Larry?

54
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:37,193
I'm probably leaving PBH.

55
00:04:37,653 --> 00:04:40,279
So this will be the last time...

56
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:42,156
...we do the Groundhog together.

57
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:45,618
What's wrong with
the Groundhog Festival?

58
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:46,953
In San Diego...

59
00:04:47,204 --> 00:04:50,873
... I covered the swallows returning
to Capistrano for six years.

60
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:55,711
Someone will see me interview
a groundhog, think I have no future.

61
00:04:55,921 --> 00:04:58,005
I think it's a nice story.

62
00:04:58,256 --> 00:05:01,050
He comes out.
He looks around.

63
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:03,010
He wrinkles up his nose.

64
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:07,056
He sees his shadow or not.
It's nice! People like it!

65
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,684
You are new, aren't you?

66
00:05:10,394 --> 00:05:12,561
People like blood sausage too.

67
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:14,313
People are morons!

68
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,565
Nice attitude.

69
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:21,153
Look in the mirror and see how you
look when you do that groundhog thing.

70
00:05:21,405 --> 00:05:22,571
For me? Once?

71
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:26,575
He comes out, and there he
looks at his little shadow.

72
00:05:27,995 --> 00:05:29,870
Want some blood sausage?
I have some--

73
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,998
I like blood sausage.

74
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:32,808
Rita, I can't stay here.

75
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:35,603
Prima donna.

76
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:38,064
-What's the matter?
-I hate this place.

77
00:06:38,273 --> 00:06:40,941
I stayed here two years ago.
I was miserable.

78
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:43,778
-I won't stay here.
-You're not staying here.

79
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:45,946
-I'm not?
-No.

80
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:47,406
Larry's dropping me off.

81
00:06:47,616 --> 00:06:50,201
I booked you in
a nice bed-and-breakfast.

82
00:06:51,286 --> 00:06:52,411
Great.

83
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:56,832
I think this is one of the traits
of a good producer.

84
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:58,793
Keep the talent happy.

85
00:06:59,211 --> 00:07:00,503
Anything I can do.

86
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:03,297
Would you help me
with my pelvic tilt?

87
00:07:05,217 --> 00:07:08,844
Within reason. Want to come
to dinner with Larry and me?

88
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:12,264
No, thank you.
I've seen Larry eat.

89
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:17,394
You get your sleep.
See you in the morning.

90
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,647
Don't be late.

91
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:24,443
Did he actually call himself
"the talent"?

92
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:56,183
Campers, rise and shine!
Don't forget your booties.

93
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:59,228
-It's cold out there!
-It's cold every day!

94
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:01,730
-Is this Miami Beach?
-Not hardly!

95
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:04,775
Expect hazardous travel
later today with...

96
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:06,443
...that blizzard thing.

97
00:08:06,695 --> 00:08:09,822
That blizzard thing.
Here's the report.

98
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:14,410
The National Weather Service
is calling for a big blizzard thing.

99
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:17,413
There's another reason
today's especially exciting--

100
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:19,373
Especially cold.

101
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:22,042
The big question
on everybody's lips--

102
00:08:22,294 --> 00:08:24,962
-Their chapped lips.
-On their chapped lips.

103
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:27,798
Will Phil come out
and see his shadow?

104
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:31,343
-Punxsutawney Phil!
-That's right, woodchuck chuckers!

105
00:08:31,595 --> 00:08:33,012
It's Groundhog Day!

106
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:36,307
Get up and check that hog out there!

107
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:41,520
-Morning!
-Morning.

108
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:43,856
-Off to see the groundhog?
-I am.

109
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:46,150
Think it'll be an early spring?

110
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:48,444
I'm predicting March 21st.

111
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:50,905
Good guess!

112
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:54,783
I think that actually is
the first day of spring.

113
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:06,045
-Did you sleep well, Mr. Connors?
-I slept alone, Mrs. Lancaster.

114
00:09:07,214 --> 00:09:08,547
Like some coffee?

115
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:13,260
Is there any possibility of getting
an espresso or cappuccino?

116
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:15,471
I really don't know....

117
00:09:15,764 --> 00:09:19,308
How to spell espresso or cappuccino.
This looks fine.

118
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,727
I hope you enjoy the festivities.

119
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:25,231
-I'm sure I will.
-There's talk of a blizzard.

120
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:28,984
We may catch a break and
it will blow right by.

121
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:31,403
The moisture coming
out of the south...

122
00:09:31,655 --> 00:09:33,864
...by midday will
push on to the east.

123
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:39,078
At high altitudes it'll crystallize
and give us what we call snow.

124
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:43,082
Our high will get to
about 30 today, teens tonight.

125
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:47,044
Chance of precipitation, about
20 percent today, 20 percent tomorrow.

126
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:50,297
Did you want to talk about
the weather or just chitchat?

127
00:09:51,216 --> 00:09:52,258
Chitchat.

128
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:54,051
See you later.

129
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,515
Will you be checking out today?

130
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:02,059
Chance of departure today,
100 percent.

131
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:23,789
Phil? Hey, Phil?

132
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:27,251
Phil? Phil Connors!
I thought that was you!

133
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,753
How you doing?
Thanks for watching.

134
00:10:30,005 --> 00:10:34,508
Don't tell me you don't remember me.
I sure as heckfire remember you.

135
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:36,677
Not a chance.

136
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:38,304
Ned!

137
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:41,098
Ryerson!

138
00:10:41,933 --> 00:10:43,684
Needlenose Ned.
Ned the Head.

139
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:46,312
Come on, buddy.
Case Western High!

140
00:10:46,521 --> 00:10:50,441
I did the whistling bellybutton
trick at the talent show.

141
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:55,571
Bing! Got the shingles real bad
senior year. Almost didn't graduate.

142
00:10:55,864 --> 00:10:57,740
Bing again!

143
00:10:57,949 --> 00:11:02,036
I dated your sister a couple times
till you told me not to anymore.

144
00:11:02,245 --> 00:11:03,537
Well?

145
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:06,457
-Ned Ryerson?
-Bing!

146
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:08,000
Bing.

147
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:11,754
Did you turn pro with
that bellybutton thing?

148
00:11:11,963 --> 00:11:13,339
I sell insurance.

149
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:15,841
-What a shock.
-Do you have insurance?

150
00:11:16,051 --> 00:11:18,010
If you do, you could
always use more.

151
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:20,846
Am I right or am I right
or am I right?

152
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:25,642
Ned, I would love to stand here
and talk with you.

153
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:27,144
But I'm not going to.

154
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:28,354
See you.

155
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:30,439
That's all right!
I'll walk with you.

156
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:33,567
I see an opportunity,
I charge it like a bull.

157
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:35,652
Ned the Bull, that's me now.

158
00:11:35,904 --> 00:11:39,448
I got friends who live and die
by the actuarial tables.

159
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:42,743
I say it's all one big
crapshoot anyhoo.

160
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:47,873
Ever heard of single-premium life?
That could be the ticket for you.

161
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:49,541
Oh, God!

162
00:11:49,793 --> 00:11:53,712
It is so good to see you!
What are you doing for dinner?

163
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:55,255
Something else.

164
00:11:55,465 --> 00:11:58,967
It's been great seeing you,
Needlehead. Take care.

165
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:06,767
Watch out for that first step.
It's a doozy!

166
00:12:35,672 --> 00:12:36,755
Phil!

167
00:12:36,965 --> 00:12:38,590
Phil, over here!

168
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:40,300
Where have you been?

169
00:12:40,552 --> 00:12:42,094
It was horrible.

170
00:12:42,345 --> 00:12:44,263
A giant leech got me.

171
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:47,099
You're missing all the fun.
These people are great!

172
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:50,978
Some of them partied all night.
They sing till they get cold.

173
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:53,814
Then they go sit by the fire
and get warm.

174
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:56,024
Then they come back
and sing some more!

175
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:59,069
Yeah. They're hicks, Rita.

176
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:02,239
So, did you sleep okay without me?

177
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,241
You tossed and turned, didn't you?

178
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:05,659
You're incredible.

179
00:13:05,994 --> 00:13:07,119
Who told you?

180
00:13:09,164 --> 00:13:10,414
It's groundhog time.

181
00:13:14,252 --> 00:13:16,044
Okay. On me in three...

182
00:13:16,254 --> 00:13:17,963
...two, one.

183
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:23,677
Once a year, the eyes of the nation
turn to this tiny hamlet...

184
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:25,554
...to watch a master at work.

185
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:26,805
The master?

186
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:28,307
Punxsutawney Phil...

187
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:31,852
...the world's most famous weatherman.
The groundhog.

188
00:13:32,103 --> 00:13:36,231
Who, as legend has it,
can predict an early spring.

189
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:39,151
The question we have
to ask ourselves is:

190
00:13:39,402 --> 00:13:41,403
"Does Phil feel lucky?"

191
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:47,659
Every year, the guy comes with
a big stick and raps on the door.

192
00:13:47,869 --> 00:13:50,621
They pull the little rat out,
talk to him.

193
00:13:50,872 --> 00:13:54,166
The rat talks back.
Then they tell us what's gonna happen.

194
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:02,382
Isn't he cute?

195
00:14:04,427 --> 00:14:07,846
Do you like the guys
with the prominent upper teeth?

196
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:09,056
No.

197
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:22,277
This February 2nd, at 7:20
and 30 seconds...

198
00:14:22,487 --> 00:14:23,946
...Punxsutawney Phil...

199
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:25,739
...the seer of seers...

200
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:28,951
...prognosticator of prognosticators...

201
00:14:29,244 --> 00:14:31,161
...emerged reluctantly...

202
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:32,454
...but alertly...

203
00:14:32,664 --> 00:14:34,706
...in Punxsutawney, PA...

204
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:37,626
...and stated in groundhog-ese:

205
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:40,045
"I definitely see a shadow."

206
00:14:42,924 --> 00:14:46,718
Sorry, folks.
Six more weeks of winter.

207
00:14:52,183 --> 00:14:54,977
On me in three, two, one.

208
00:14:56,354 --> 00:14:58,647
This is one time where
television fails...

209
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:01,733
...to capture the excitement
of a large squirrel...

210
00:15:01,943 --> 00:15:03,193
...predicting the weather.

211
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:06,738
I'm grateful to have been here.
From Punxsutawney...

212
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:09,658
...this is Phil Connors.
So long.

213
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:12,035
Want to try it again
without the sarcasm?

214
00:15:12,287 --> 00:15:14,830
We got it. I'm out of here.

215
00:15:15,707 --> 00:15:17,374
Prima donnas.

216
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:32,681
Oh, boy.
Take a look at this.

217
00:15:33,808 --> 00:15:35,475
What is going on?

218
00:15:35,685 --> 00:15:39,646
I don't know. Perhaps that
blizzard we're not supposed to get.

219
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,231
This is impossible.

220
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:43,525
Hey, hey, hey. No, no, no.

221
00:15:43,693 --> 00:15:46,778
Nobody honks this horn but me,
okay, pal?

222
00:15:50,742 --> 00:15:53,744
No, no!

223
00:16:08,176 --> 00:16:09,676
Take it out of here.

224
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:12,512
Commander, what's going on?

225
00:16:12,764 --> 00:16:14,890
Nothing.
We're closing the road.

226
00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:18,727
-Big blizzard moving in.
-It's a couple of flakes.

227
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:21,647
Don't you listen to the weather?
We got a major storm.

228
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:23,857
I make the weather.

229
00:16:24,067 --> 00:16:29,071
All this moisture from the Gulf
will push off to the east in Altoona.

230
00:16:29,364 --> 00:16:31,782
You got that moisture on your head.

231
00:16:32,075 --> 00:16:33,992
You can go back to Punxsutawney...

232
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:37,537
...or you can freeze to death.
It's your choice.

233
00:16:37,872 --> 00:16:39,915
So, what's it going to be?

234
00:16:42,877 --> 00:16:44,044
I'm thinking.

235
00:16:44,671 --> 00:16:48,256
Come on, all the long-distance
lines are down?

236
00:16:49,092 --> 00:16:50,550
What about the satellite?

237
00:16:50,802 --> 00:16:52,719
Is it snowing in space?

238
00:16:53,888 --> 00:16:58,225
Don't you keep a line open
for emergencies or celebrities?

239
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:02,729
I'm both.
I'm a celebrity in an emergency.

240
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:05,732
Can you patch me through
on that line?

241
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:16,201
Could I have one more of these
with some booze in it?

242
00:17:17,328 --> 00:17:20,163
-Oh, I like it here.
-Phil.

243
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:22,374
Going to the groundhog dinner?

244
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:24,334
No, I had groundhog for lunch.

245
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:26,837
Wasn't bad.
Tastes like chicken.

246
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,964
You two run along.

247
00:17:30,258 --> 00:17:32,342
Looking foxy tonight, man.

248
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:36,054
Is your troop selling
cookies again this year?

249
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:37,597
That's so funny.

250
00:17:37,932 --> 00:17:39,307
So, what are you doing?

251
00:17:39,851 --> 00:17:42,060
I think I'll go back to my room...

252
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:45,856
...take a hot shower
and maybe read Hustler.

253
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:47,482
Suit yourself.

254
00:18:06,127 --> 00:18:07,210
Yo, mom.

255
00:18:07,462 --> 00:18:09,171
Isn’t there any hot water?

256
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:11,298
Oh, no, there wouldn't be today.

257
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:14,009
Of course not. Silly me.

258
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:15,677
Sweet dreams.

259
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:42,496
Campers, rise and shine!
Don't forget your booties.

260
00:18:42,747 --> 00:18:45,916
-It's cold out there!
-It's cold every day!

261
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:48,001
-Is this Miami Beach?
-Not hardly!

262
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:51,546
Nice going, boys.
You're playing yesterday's tape.

263
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:53,256
--with that blizzard thing.

264
00:18:53,508 --> 00:18:56,176
That blizzard thing?
Here's the report.

265
00:18:56,385 --> 00:19:00,889
The National Weather Service
is calling for a big blizzard thing.

266
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:04,100
There's another reason
today's especially exciting--

267
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:06,353
Especially cold.

268
00:19:06,604 --> 00:19:08,772
The big question
on everybody's lips--

269
00:19:09,023 --> 00:19:11,566
-Chapped lips.
-Their chapped lips.

270
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:14,694
Will Phil come out
and see his shadow?

271
00:19:14,904 --> 00:19:18,240
-Punxsutawney Phil!
-That's right, woodchuck chuckers!

272
00:19:18,449 --> 00:19:19,825
It's Groundhog Day!

273
00:19:20,034 --> 00:19:22,828
Get up and check that hog out there!

274
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:28,500
What the hell?

275
00:19:36,551 --> 00:19:39,469
Morning! Off to see the groundhog?

276
00:19:40,263 --> 00:19:42,848
-Yeah.
-Think it'll be an early spring?

277
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:45,600
Didn't we do this yesterday?

278
00:19:46,227 --> 00:19:47,686
I don't know what you mean.

279
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:50,605
Don't mess with me, Pork Chop!

280
00:19:50,982 --> 00:19:54,067
-What day is this?
-It's February 2nd.

281
00:19:54,402 --> 00:19:55,861
Groundhog Day.

282
00:19:58,781 --> 00:20:01,700
I'm sorry. I thought it was yesterday.

283
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:26,224
Did you sleep well, Mr. Connors?

284
00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:28,518
Did I sleep well?

285
00:20:28,811 --> 00:20:30,478
Like some coffee?

286
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:33,398
Yes, please.
I think I'll have a double.

287
00:20:33,691 --> 00:20:36,067
I hope you enjoy the festivities.

288
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:38,737
There's talk of a blizzard.

289
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:43,575
Ever have déjà vu,
Mrs. Lancaster?

290
00:20:43,826 --> 00:20:46,453
I don't think so,
but I'll check with the kitchen.

291
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:48,622
No, that's okay. Thank you.

292
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:52,751
Will you be checking out today,
Mr. Connors?

293
00:20:55,046 --> 00:20:59,341
I'd say the chance
of departure is 80 percent.

294
00:21:00,551 --> 00:21:02,260
75 to 80.

295
00:21:07,475 --> 00:21:08,934
Excuse me!

296
00:21:09,727 --> 00:21:11,978
Excuse me. Where's everybody going?

297
00:21:12,563 --> 00:21:14,022
To Gobbler's Knob.

298
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:15,482
It's Groundhog Day.

299
00:21:16,317 --> 00:21:18,735
It's still just once a year, isn't it?

300
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:28,119
Hey! Phil?

301
00:21:28,329 --> 00:21:30,330
Phil? Hey!

302
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,375
Phil Connors!
I thought that was you!

303
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:35,877
My, oh my, Phil Connors!

304
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:40,048
Don't say you don't remember me.
I sure as heckfire remember you.

305
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:42,759
-Well?
-Ned Ryerson?

306
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:46,346
Bing! First shot
right out of the box!

307
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:49,182
So how's it going, old buddy?

308
00:21:49,475 --> 00:21:52,310
I'm not feeling well.
Would you excuse me?

309
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:57,357
It's funny you should mention
your health. Guess what I do now.

310
00:21:57,608 --> 00:21:59,609
Do you sell insurance?

311
00:21:59,902 --> 00:22:02,737
Bing again!
You are sharp as a tack today!

312
00:22:02,989 --> 00:22:04,823
Do you have life insurance?

313
00:22:05,074 --> 00:22:07,367
If you do, you could
always use more.

314
00:22:07,618 --> 00:22:09,536
Right! I mean, who couldn't?

315
00:22:09,704 --> 00:22:11,121
But you wanna know something?

316
00:22:11,372 --> 00:22:13,373
I gots a feeling...

317
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:15,291
...you ain't got any.

318
00:22:15,543 --> 00:22:18,378
Am I right or am I right
or am I right?

319
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:19,963
I got to go.

320
00:22:24,427 --> 00:22:28,388
Watch out for that first step.
It's a doozy!

321
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:55,415
Phil! Over here!

322
00:22:57,585 --> 00:23:00,253
-Where have you been?
-Rita. Do me a favor.

323
00:23:00,463 --> 00:23:03,590
I need someone to give me a
good, hard slap in the face.

324
00:23:05,259 --> 00:23:07,719
-How's that?
-Good!

325
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:11,681
If you need help with the other cheek,
I'm right here.

326
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:14,809
Something's going on.

327
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:17,771
-Are you drunk or something?
-Drunk's more fun.

328
00:23:18,022 --> 00:23:20,023
Can I be serious with you
for a minute?

329
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:21,357
I don't know, can you?

330
00:23:21,567 --> 00:23:23,401
Yes, I'm being serious!

331
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:27,655
I'm having a problem.
I may be having a problem.

332
00:23:27,865 --> 00:23:30,116
-Rita, Rita.
-It's groundhog time.

333
00:23:30,326 --> 00:23:32,577
See? I knew you'd say that!

334
00:23:32,995 --> 00:23:34,537
I really feel...

335
00:23:34,789 --> 00:23:36,206
...weird.

336
00:23:36,457 --> 00:23:38,750
Let's just do this.
Then we'll talk.

337
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:42,545
All right, on me in three...

338
00:23:43,047 --> 00:23:44,589
...two, one.

339
00:23:45,216 --> 00:23:46,925
Well, it's Groundhog Day...

340
00:23:47,176 --> 00:23:48,510
...again...

341
00:23:48,761 --> 00:23:51,638
...and that must mean we're
up here at Gobbler's Knob...

342
00:23:51,889 --> 00:23:55,642
...waiting for the world's most famous
groundhog weatherman...

343
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:57,185
...Punxsutawney Phil...

344
00:23:57,436 --> 00:24:01,397
...who's gonna tell us how much more
winter to expect.

345
00:24:07,113 --> 00:24:08,488
This is a riot!

346
00:24:12,034 --> 00:24:13,201
Isn’t he cute?

347
00:24:14,328 --> 00:24:18,206
This February 2nd, at 7:20
and 30 seconds...

348
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:22,127
...Punxsutawney Phil,
the seer of seers...

349
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:25,213
...prognosticator of prognosticators...

350
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:27,423
...emerged reluctantly...

351
00:24:27,675 --> 00:24:29,926
...but alertly in Punxsu--

352
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:34,472
Oh, my gosh!

353
00:24:37,059 --> 00:24:39,060
I know there's a blizzard.

354
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:42,397
When will the long-distance
lines be repaired?

355
00:24:44,275 --> 00:24:48,444
What if there is no tomorrow?
There wasn't one today.

356
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:46,586
Morning!

357
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:48,338
Off to see the groundhog?

358
00:25:54,929 --> 00:25:57,013
Did you sleep well, Mr.--

359
00:26:11,487 --> 00:26:13,529
Phil Connors! I thought--

360
00:26:15,074 --> 00:26:18,326
Don't say you don't remember me.
I sure as heckfire remember you!

361
00:26:18,535 --> 00:26:20,620
It's me, Ned! Ryerson!

362
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:23,331
Needlenose Ned! Ned the Head!

363
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:30,255
Phil! Over here!

364
00:26:31,632 --> 00:26:34,592
Can I talk to you?
It's not work-related.

365
00:26:34,802 --> 00:26:37,720
-You never talk about work.
-We have to talk.

366
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:41,057
-It's a creative meeting.
-We've got work to do!

367
00:26:41,267 --> 00:26:43,685
I don't.
I've already done it twice.

368
00:26:43,936 --> 00:26:46,896
When you get finished,
meet me in the diner.

369
00:26:49,358 --> 00:26:52,443
-What's that all about?
-I don't know.

370
00:26:52,695 --> 00:26:54,279
Prima donnas.

371
00:26:57,866 --> 00:26:58,908
More coffee?

372
00:26:59,076 --> 00:27:02,912
Just the check, please.
These sticky buns are heaven.

373
00:27:03,122 --> 00:27:04,622
Aren't they?

374
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,459
Just put that anywhere, pal!

375
00:27:08,669 --> 00:27:10,253
Good save!

376
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:15,216
Tell me why you're too sick to work.
It better be good.

377
00:27:17,428 --> 00:27:21,306
I'm reliving the same day
over and over.

378
00:27:21,682 --> 00:27:24,017
Groundhog Day. Today.

379
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:27,770
Okay. I'm waiting for the punch line.

380
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:30,940
Really! This is the third time!

381
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:33,151
It's like yesterday never happened!

382
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:37,363
I'm racking my brain trying to imagine
why you'd make this up.

383
00:27:38,282 --> 00:27:40,950
I'm not making it up.
I'm asking for help!

384
00:27:41,618 --> 00:27:43,494
What do you want me to do?

385
00:27:43,704 --> 00:27:47,040
I don't know! You're a producer.
Come up with something.

386
00:27:47,249 --> 00:27:49,876
You should get
your head examined...

387
00:27:50,127 --> 00:27:53,421
...if you expect me to believe
a stupid story like that!

388
00:27:53,714 --> 00:27:55,423
Phil? Like the groundhog Phil?

389
00:27:55,758 --> 00:27:58,343
Yeah. Like the groundhog Phil.

390
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:01,179
Look out for your shadow, pal!

391
00:28:02,056 --> 00:28:03,973
Morons, your bus is leaving!

392
00:28:05,059 --> 00:28:08,686
You guys ready? We better go,
to stay ahead of the weather.

393
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:13,483
-Let's talk about it in Pittsburgh.
-I'm not going back to Pittsburgh.

394
00:28:13,776 --> 00:28:15,985
-Why not?
-Because of the blizzard!

395
00:28:16,278 --> 00:28:18,696
You said it was going
to hit Altoona.

396
00:28:18,906 --> 00:28:21,574
I know that's what I said.

397
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:24,285
I think you need help.

398
00:28:25,079 --> 00:28:28,164
That's what I've been saying.
I need help.

399
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:30,792
No spots.

400
00:28:31,043 --> 00:28:33,503
No clots, no tumors.

401
00:28:33,754 --> 00:28:35,129
No lesions.

402
00:28:35,339 --> 00:28:36,923
No aneurysms.

403
00:28:37,174 --> 00:28:38,716
At least none that I can see.

404
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:42,845
If you want a CAT scan or an MRI,
you'll have to go into Pittsburgh.

405
00:28:43,055 --> 00:28:45,264
I can't go into Pittsburgh.

406
00:28:45,516 --> 00:28:49,102
-Why can't you go into Pittsburgh?
-I told you, there's a blizzard.

407
00:28:49,311 --> 00:28:50,561
Right. The blizzard!

408
00:28:50,813 --> 00:28:53,481
You know what you may need,
Mr. Connors?

409
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:55,608
A biopsy.

410
00:28:56,068 --> 00:28:57,860
A psychiatrist.

411
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:02,073
That's an unusual problem...

412
00:29:02,324 --> 00:29:03,408
...Mr. Connors.

413
00:29:05,244 --> 00:29:09,914
Most of my work is with couples,
families. I have an alcoholic now.

414
00:29:12,251 --> 00:29:14,001
You went to college, right?

415
00:29:14,211 --> 00:29:16,546
It wasn't veterinary
psychology, was it?

416
00:29:16,797 --> 00:29:19,757
Didn't you take a course that
covered this stuff?

417
00:29:19,967 --> 00:29:22,468
Sort of, I guess.

418
00:29:24,138 --> 00:29:25,888
Abnormal psychology.

419
00:29:26,306 --> 00:29:28,266
So...

420
00:29:29,393 --> 00:29:30,685
...what do I do?

421
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,854
We should meet again.

422
00:29:33,814 --> 00:29:35,815
How's tomorrow for you?

423
00:29:38,569 --> 00:29:39,944
Is that not good?

424
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:53,583
I was in the Virgin Islands once.

425
00:29:53,834 --> 00:29:55,835
I met a girl.

426
00:29:56,044 --> 00:29:57,336
We ate lobster.

427
00:29:57,588 --> 00:29:59,589
Drank piña coladas.

428
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,383
At sunset, we made love
like sea otters.

429
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:08,556
That was a pretty good day.

430
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:10,641
Why couldn't I get that day...

431
00:30:10,851 --> 00:30:11,976
...over...

432
00:30:12,186 --> 00:30:14,395
...and over and over?

433
00:30:14,688 --> 00:30:18,566
Some guys would look
at this glass and say:

434
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:20,234
"That glass is half empty."

435
00:30:20,486 --> 00:30:24,280
Other guys would say,
"That glass is half full."

436
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:27,867
I peg you as a "glass is half empty"
kind of guy. Right?

437
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:33,206
What would you do if you were
stuck in one place...

438
00:30:33,457 --> 00:30:37,376
...and every day was exactly the same,
and nothing you did mattered?

439
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:42,715
That about sums it up for me.

440
00:30:50,307 --> 00:30:51,349
Good luck.

441
00:30:51,558 --> 00:30:52,975
I'll drop you off.

442
00:30:55,145 --> 00:30:57,355
This thing sticks a little bit.

443
00:30:57,606 --> 00:30:59,106
You got to jiggle it--

444
00:30:59,358 --> 00:31:01,526
Come on up here, pal.

445
00:31:01,735 --> 00:31:04,195
Give me your keys, pal.
Give me the keys.

446
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:07,156
Friends don't let friends drive, right?
Stand up here.

447
00:31:07,366 --> 00:31:10,326
Take a deep breath. You feel okay?

448
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:11,953
You're all right.

449
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:21,128
You want to throw up here
or in the car?

450
00:31:21,505 --> 00:31:24,048
I think, both.

451
00:31:35,227 --> 00:31:37,186
I don't think I should drive.

452
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:39,313
I don't either.

453
00:31:39,565 --> 00:31:40,940
Watch your head.

454
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:44,318
Watch your knees.
Don't break anything.

455
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:46,696
Let's not forget seat belts.

456
00:31:48,657 --> 00:31:51,784
Who else could go for some
flapjacks right now?

457
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,749
Let me ask you a question.

458
00:31:59,001 --> 00:32:00,042
Shoot.

459
00:32:01,378 --> 00:32:03,379
What if there were no tomorrow?

460
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:07,216
No tomorrow? That means there'd be
no consequences...

461
00:32:07,467 --> 00:32:09,010
...no hangovers.

462
00:32:09,261 --> 00:32:11,721
We could do whatever we wanted!

463
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:14,515
That's true.

464
00:32:14,725 --> 00:32:17,852
We could do whatever we want.

465
00:32:23,442 --> 00:32:26,986
If we wanted to hit mailboxes,
we could let Ralph drive!

466
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:35,369
They want you to stop.

467
00:32:35,537 --> 00:32:36,579
Hang on!

468
00:32:42,252 --> 00:32:44,253
It's the same thing
your whole life.

469
00:32:44,713 --> 00:32:47,632
"Clean up your room! Stand up
straight! Pick up your feet!

470
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:49,634
Take it like a man!

471
00:32:49,843 --> 00:32:51,510
Be nice to your sister!

472
00:32:52,346 --> 00:32:54,847
Don't mix beer and wine, ever!

473
00:32:56,642 --> 00:32:58,851
Don't drive on the railroad tracks!"

474
00:33:00,437 --> 00:33:01,729
That's one I agree with.

475
00:33:11,323 --> 00:33:13,449
I don't know, Gus.

476
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:16,452
Sometimes I think you just have to...

477
00:33:16,703 --> 00:33:19,080
...take the big chances.

478
00:33:19,498 --> 00:33:21,666
This is the police!
Pull over immediately!

479
00:33:23,043 --> 00:33:25,252
We're talking in here!

480
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:32,343
I bet he swerves first.

481
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:49,860
I'm not going to live by
their rules anymore!

482
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:51,696
I noticed that.

483
00:33:51,905 --> 00:33:54,448
You make choices
and you live with them.

484
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:10,256
My knee!

485
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:14,844
Let me handle this.

486
00:34:17,431 --> 00:34:20,182
Three cheeseburgers,
two large fries...

487
00:34:20,434 --> 00:34:22,518
...two chocolate shakes
and one large Coke.

488
00:34:22,728 --> 00:34:24,645
And some flapjacks!

489
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:26,731
Too early for flapjacks?

490
00:34:40,287 --> 00:34:41,579
Yes!

491
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:44,457
Rise and shine, campers!

492
00:34:44,708 --> 00:34:47,710
Don't forget your booties!
It's cold out there today!

493
00:34:47,961 --> 00:34:49,336
It's cold every day.

494
00:34:49,588 --> 00:34:52,673
What is this, Miami Beach?
Not hardly!

495
00:34:57,262 --> 00:34:58,679
Slept like a baby.

496
00:34:58,847 --> 00:35:00,848
I'd love some of your coffee.

497
00:35:01,016 --> 00:35:02,808
-I hope--
-Flurries moving in later...

498
00:35:03,018 --> 00:35:05,478
...but the blizzard's going to hit
outside of town.

499
00:35:05,645 --> 00:35:06,687
Mrs. Lancaster?

500
00:35:06,855 --> 00:35:09,148
Was anybody looking for me
here this morning?

501
00:35:09,399 --> 00:35:12,818
Perhaps a state official?
Maybe a blue hat, gun, nightstick?

502
00:35:13,028 --> 00:35:15,946
No, no one like that!
Will there be?

503
00:35:16,156 --> 00:35:17,823
Apparently not.

504
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:23,329
Will you hold my room for me?
I'm staying an extra day.

505
00:35:29,169 --> 00:35:31,170
Catch you tomorrow, pops.

506
00:35:36,676 --> 00:35:38,886
-Phil Connors!
-Ned?

507
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:13,587
I like to see a man of advancing years
throw caution to the wind.

508
00:36:13,797 --> 00:36:16,090
It's inspiring, in a way.

509
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:19,343
My years are not advancing
as fast as you think.

510
00:36:19,886 --> 00:36:20,928
More coffee?

511
00:36:21,513 --> 00:36:22,680
Keep it coming.

512
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:24,139
Sure thing.

513
00:36:25,976 --> 00:36:28,352
Just put that anywhere, pal!

514
00:36:28,728 --> 00:36:29,979
Good save!

515
00:36:32,065 --> 00:36:35,818
Don't you worry about cholesterol,
lung cancer, love handles?

516
00:36:38,154 --> 00:36:39,864
I don't worry anymore.

517
00:36:40,323 --> 00:36:42,616
What makes you special?
Everybody worries.

518
00:36:43,076 --> 00:36:45,703
That's exactly what makes me
so special.

519
00:36:45,912 --> 00:36:47,705
I don't even have to floss.

520
00:36:57,424 --> 00:36:58,465
What?

521
00:37:00,302 --> 00:37:03,971
The wretch, concentered all in self

522
00:37:04,389 --> 00:37:06,724
Living, shall forfeit fair renown

523
00:37:07,142 --> 00:37:10,060
And doubly dying, shall go down

524
00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:13,272
To the vile dust from whence he sprung

525
00:37:13,523 --> 00:37:17,568
Unwept, unhonored and unsung

526
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:20,237
Sir Walter Scott.

527
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:24,783
You don't like poetry?

528
00:37:25,535 --> 00:37:26,911
I love poetry!

529
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:30,247
I just thought that was Willard Scott.
I was confused.

530
00:37:30,749 --> 00:37:33,208
You think I act like this
because I'm egocentric?

531
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:36,629
You are egocentric.
It's your defining characteristic.

532
00:37:38,882 --> 00:37:42,551
You guys ready? We better go,
to stay ahead of the weather.

533
00:37:42,761 --> 00:37:43,802
Thanks, Larry.

534
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:46,096
Would you like a doggy bag?

535
00:37:46,556 --> 00:37:47,973
I'll stay and finish.

536
00:37:48,183 --> 00:37:50,476
I thought you hated this town.

537
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:52,561
It's beginning to grow on me.

538
00:37:53,897 --> 00:37:56,732
Larry, quit staring.
These are excellent.

539
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:11,121
You see the groundhog
this morning?

540
00:38:12,791 --> 00:38:14,458
I never miss it.

541
00:38:14,751 --> 00:38:16,335
What's your name?

542
00:38:18,213 --> 00:38:20,297
Nancy Taylor. And you are?

543
00:38:20,507 --> 00:38:23,050
-What high school did you go to?
-What?

544
00:38:23,259 --> 00:38:24,301
High school.

545
00:38:25,679 --> 00:38:28,263
Lincoln, in Pittsburgh.
Who are you?

546
00:38:28,473 --> 00:38:31,684
Who was your 12th grade
English teacher?

547
00:38:31,935 --> 00:38:33,310
Are you kidding?

548
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:35,771
In 12th grade,
your English teacher was--

549
00:38:35,981 --> 00:38:37,898
Mrs. Walsh.

550
00:38:38,108 --> 00:38:41,151
Nancy. Lincoln. Walsh.

551
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:43,862
Thanks very much.

552
00:38:58,962 --> 00:39:00,546
Nancy?

553
00:39:01,423 --> 00:39:03,882
Nancy Taylor!

554
00:39:04,384 --> 00:39:06,593
Lincoln High School!

555
00:39:07,012 --> 00:39:10,347
I sat next to you in
Mrs. Walsh's English class!

556
00:39:10,807 --> 00:39:14,101
-I'm sorry.
-Phil Connors!

557
00:39:15,437 --> 00:39:17,855
-That's amazing!
-You don't remember me?

558
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:22,192
I asked you to the prom.

559
00:39:23,445 --> 00:39:25,195
Phil Connors?

560
00:39:25,739 --> 00:39:27,948
I was short and I've sprouted.

561
00:39:32,412 --> 00:39:34,079
How are you?

562
00:39:34,789 --> 00:39:35,831
Great.

563
00:39:36,082 --> 00:39:37,791
You look terrific!

564
00:39:38,084 --> 00:39:41,253
You look very, very terrific!

565
00:39:42,756 --> 00:39:45,174
Listen, I got to go do this report.

566
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:46,633
Are you a reporter?

567
00:39:46,843 --> 00:39:49,344
A weatherman with
Channel 9, Pittsburgh.

568
00:39:49,596 --> 00:39:51,513
I should have known! That's great!

569
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:53,474
But maybe later we could....

570
00:39:53,683 --> 00:39:54,933
Yeah, whatever!

571
00:39:55,268 --> 00:39:56,935
Stay right here.

572
00:39:57,353 --> 00:40:00,522
Promise me?
I'll be right back. Wish me luck!

573
00:40:00,774 --> 00:40:02,483
Good luck!

574
00:40:20,376 --> 00:40:21,668
Oh, Phil.

575
00:40:22,712 --> 00:40:24,088
Oh, Rita.

576
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:29,176
Who's Rita?

577
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:31,261
How should I know?

578
00:40:31,554 --> 00:40:34,098
What is this,
some kind of one-night stand?

579
00:40:34,349 --> 00:40:36,308
On the contrary, Nancy...

580
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:39,812
... I love you.
I've always loved you.

581
00:40:40,605 --> 00:40:43,107
This is going to seem sudden but...

582
00:40:44,484 --> 00:40:46,485
...Nancy, will you be my wife?

583
00:40:53,368 --> 00:40:54,827
Rita.

584
00:40:55,662 --> 00:40:58,163
-Nancy.
-Whatever.

585
00:41:02,627 --> 00:41:04,837
A gust of wind.

586
00:41:06,756 --> 00:41:08,382
A dog barks.

587
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:11,176
Cue the truck.

588
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:20,102
Exit Herman.

589
00:41:20,812 --> 00:41:22,688
Walk on to the bank.

590
00:41:22,939 --> 00:41:26,984
Exit Felix, and stand there with a
not-so-bright look on your face.

591
00:41:28,903 --> 00:41:30,904
All right, Doris. Come on.

592
00:41:31,573 --> 00:41:34,491
Fix your bra, honey.
That's better.

593
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:36,910
Felix!

594
00:41:37,162 --> 00:41:38,579
How you doing, Doris?

595
00:41:38,788 --> 00:41:41,373
Can I have a roll of quarters?

596
00:41:42,584 --> 00:41:47,212
Ten...nine...eight...

597
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:49,256
...car...

598
00:41:49,465 --> 00:41:52,551
...six...five...

599
00:41:52,802 --> 00:41:54,928
...quarters...

600
00:41:55,305 --> 00:41:58,891
...three...two....

601
00:42:06,691 --> 00:42:07,858
Felix?

602
00:42:08,067 --> 00:42:11,653
-Did I bring out two bags or one?
-I don't know.

603
00:42:38,932 --> 00:42:41,475
I thought we were going
to a costume party.

604
00:42:41,726 --> 00:42:44,603
It's like I said, I love this film.

605
00:42:44,854 --> 00:42:47,064
I've seen it over 100 times.

606
00:42:47,315 --> 00:42:48,357
Phil!

607
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:49,816
Told you...

608
00:42:50,068 --> 00:42:52,319
...call me "Bronco."

609
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:54,363
Sorry, Bronco.

610
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:57,282
Hi, Nancy.

611
00:43:01,496 --> 00:43:03,455
My own fiancée...

612
00:43:03,706 --> 00:43:05,832
...doesn't remember me.

613
00:43:08,962 --> 00:43:11,505
That'll be one adult and--

614
00:43:11,756 --> 00:43:15,008
-Two adults.
-Two adults, I guess.

615
00:43:17,804 --> 00:43:22,933
--groundhog who, as legend has it,
can predict an early spring.

616
00:43:23,142 --> 00:43:25,894
The question we have
to ask ourselves today is:

617
00:43:26,145 --> 00:43:28,105
"Does Phil feel lucky?"

618
00:43:28,314 --> 00:43:31,108
Rita, if you only
had one day to live...

619
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:32,985
...what would you do?

620
00:43:33,236 --> 00:43:35,779
I don't know.
What are you dying of?

621
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:40,492
No, the whole world
is about to explode.

622
00:43:40,702 --> 00:43:41,743
What do you do?

623
00:43:41,953 --> 00:43:44,246
I want to know
where to put the camera.

624
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:46,957
What are you looking for?
A date for the weekend?

625
00:43:47,208 --> 00:43:50,043
No, I'm just interested in you.

626
00:43:50,295 --> 00:43:52,546
What do you want?
What do you like?

627
00:43:52,755 --> 00:43:54,631
What do you think about?

628
00:43:54,882 --> 00:43:57,175
What kind of men
are you interested in?

629
00:43:57,385 --> 00:43:59,219
What do you do for fun?

630
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:03,140
Are you trying to
make me look like a fool?

631
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:07,561
I'm trying to talk like normal people.
Isn’t this how they talk?

632
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:10,105
-Close.
-Okay, so talk to me.

633
00:44:10,356 --> 00:44:12,566
Let me buy you a cup of coffee.

634
00:44:14,736 --> 00:44:15,777
And a doughnut.

635
00:44:15,945 --> 00:44:17,571
All right.

636
00:44:19,949 --> 00:44:21,950
So what do you want out of life?

637
00:44:23,870 --> 00:44:26,121
I guess I want what everybody wants.

638
00:44:26,331 --> 00:44:29,875
Career, love, marriage, children.

639
00:44:30,293 --> 00:44:31,752
Are you seeing anyone?

640
00:44:32,253 --> 00:44:36,923
This is getting too personal.
I'm not ready to share this with you.

641
00:44:38,092 --> 00:44:40,344
How about you?
What do you want?

642
00:44:41,512 --> 00:44:44,806
What I really want
is someone like you.

643
00:44:45,058 --> 00:44:46,350
Oh, please!

644
00:44:46,601 --> 00:44:48,769
Why not? What are you looking for?

645
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:50,354
Who's your perfect guy?

646
00:44:51,731 --> 00:44:55,734
First of all, he's too humble
to know he's perfect.

647
00:44:57,070 --> 00:44:58,445
That's me!

648
00:44:58,696 --> 00:45:02,032
He's intelligent,
supportive, funny....

649
00:45:02,283 --> 00:45:04,493
Intelligent, supportive, funny.

650
00:45:04,744 --> 00:45:08,080
Me, me, me.

651
00:45:08,331 --> 00:45:11,124
He's romantic and courageous.

652
00:45:11,376 --> 00:45:12,626
Me also.

653
00:45:13,211 --> 00:45:16,797
He's got a good body but doesn't
have to look in the mirror often.

654
00:45:17,465 --> 00:45:22,302
I have a great body, and sometimes
I go months without looking.

655
00:45:24,806 --> 00:45:28,308
He's kind, sensitive and gentle.

656
00:45:28,851 --> 00:45:30,685
He's not afraid to cry.

657
00:45:30,937 --> 00:45:33,522
This is a man
we're talking about, right?

658
00:45:33,773 --> 00:45:38,735
He likes animals, children,
and he'll change poopy diapers.

659
00:45:38,986 --> 00:45:41,363
Does he have to use the word "poopy"?

660
00:45:42,907 --> 00:45:46,368
He plays an instrument,
and he loves his mother.

661
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:50,372
I am really close on this one.

662
00:45:51,165 --> 00:45:53,917
Really, really close.

663
00:45:58,381 --> 00:45:59,965
It's Phil Connors!

664
00:46:00,174 --> 00:46:01,466
Hello.

665
00:46:01,676 --> 00:46:03,510
Thanks for watching.

666
00:46:16,441 --> 00:46:19,609
What are the chances
of getting out today?

667
00:46:19,861 --> 00:46:22,112
Van won't start.
Larry's working on it.

668
00:46:22,363 --> 00:46:23,780
Wouldn't you know it?

669
00:46:24,031 --> 00:46:25,824
Can I buy you a drink?

670
00:46:28,453 --> 00:46:31,121
Jim Beam, ice, water.

671
00:46:31,956 --> 00:46:33,081
For you, miss?

672
00:46:33,541 --> 00:46:36,877
Sweet vermouth on the rocks
with a twist, please.

673
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:44,426
What are the chances
of getting out today?

674
00:46:44,677 --> 00:46:47,095
Van won't start.
Larry's working on it.

675
00:46:47,346 --> 00:46:48,972
Wouldn't you know it?

676
00:46:49,182 --> 00:46:51,057
Can I buy you a drink?

677
00:46:53,936 --> 00:46:56,646
Sweet vermouth, rocks,
with a twist, please.

678
00:46:56,856 --> 00:46:59,608
-For you, miss?
-The same.

679
00:47:00,443 --> 00:47:02,110
That's my favorite drink.

680
00:47:02,361 --> 00:47:04,112
Mine too!

681
00:47:04,363 --> 00:47:05,906
It makes me think of Rome.

682
00:47:06,157 --> 00:47:09,409
The way the sun hits
the buildings in the afternoon.

683
00:47:11,162 --> 00:47:13,163
What should we drink to?

684
00:47:14,415 --> 00:47:16,333
To the groundhog!

685
00:47:16,584 --> 00:47:19,211
I always drink to world peace.

686
00:47:28,137 --> 00:47:30,055
Can I buy you a drink?

687
00:47:32,975 --> 00:47:36,019
Sweet vermouth, rocks,
with a twist, please.

688
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:38,396
For you, miss?

689
00:47:38,648 --> 00:47:40,315
The same.

690
00:47:40,942 --> 00:47:42,400
That's my favorite drink.

691
00:47:42,652 --> 00:47:44,236
Mine too!

692
00:47:45,446 --> 00:47:47,697
It makes me think of Rome.

693
00:47:47,949 --> 00:47:51,743
The way the sun hits
the buildings in the afternoon.

694
00:47:52,828 --> 00:47:54,663
What should we drink to?

695
00:47:56,707 --> 00:47:59,876
I like to say a prayer
and drink to world peace.

696
00:48:01,837 --> 00:48:03,630
To world peace.

697
00:48:13,683 --> 00:48:17,018
-This is wonderful!
-See? Didn't I tell you?

698
00:48:17,228 --> 00:48:19,271
How do you know so much
about Punxsutawney?

699
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:21,898
I spend a lot of time here.

700
00:48:22,066 --> 00:48:24,317
Small-town people are
more real, down-to-earth.

701
00:48:24,485 --> 00:48:26,820
-That's how I feel!
-Really?

702
00:48:27,029 --> 00:48:30,156
-Some white chocolate?
-Yuck, don't make me sick.

703
00:48:30,408 --> 00:48:31,575
No white chocolate.

704
00:48:31,784 --> 00:48:34,703
There is something
so familiar about this.

705
00:48:34,954 --> 00:48:37,038
Do you ever have déjà vu?

706
00:48:37,290 --> 00:48:39,499
Didn't you just ask me that?

707
00:48:43,462 --> 00:48:47,048
People place too much
emphasis on their careers.

708
00:48:47,258 --> 00:48:50,427
I wish we could all live
in the mountains.

709
00:48:50,636 --> 00:48:54,347
That's where I see myself
in five years. How about you?

710
00:48:54,599 --> 00:48:57,434
I agree. I just like
to go with the flow.

711
00:48:57,643 --> 00:48:59,728
See where it leads me.

712
00:48:59,979 --> 00:49:01,813
Well, it's led you here.

713
00:49:03,566 --> 00:49:07,235
It's about a million miles
from where I started in college.

714
00:49:07,486 --> 00:49:10,989
You weren't in broadcasting
or journalism?

715
00:49:12,074 --> 00:49:16,202
Believe it or not, I studied
19th-century French poetry.

716
00:49:16,495 --> 00:49:18,079
What a waste of time!

717
00:49:18,289 --> 00:49:21,249
I mean, for someone else
that'd be a total waste.

718
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:23,543
So bold of you to choose that.

719
00:49:23,794 --> 00:49:27,464
It's incredible.
You must be a very strong person.

720
00:49:29,216 --> 00:49:32,719
People place too much
emphasis on their careers.

721
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:37,515
I wish we could all
live in the mountains.

722
00:49:37,767 --> 00:49:40,018
That's where I see myself
in five years.

723
00:49:40,227 --> 00:49:41,269
How about you?

724
00:49:41,479 --> 00:49:45,398
I agree. I like to go
with the flow, see what happens.

725
00:49:45,650 --> 00:49:47,942
Well, it's gotten you here.

726
00:49:48,486 --> 00:49:51,696
It's a million miles
from where I started in college.

727
00:49:51,947 --> 00:49:55,408
You weren't in broadcasting
or journalism or anything like that?

728
00:49:56,535 --> 00:50:00,622
Believe it or not, I studied
19th-century French poetry.

729
00:50:17,556 --> 00:50:18,848
You speak French!

730
00:50:24,689 --> 00:50:27,357
I haven't done this since I was a kid.

731
00:50:27,608 --> 00:50:29,401
Me neither. It's fun!

732
00:50:29,694 --> 00:50:30,735
Clean fun.

733
00:50:33,614 --> 00:50:37,117
I hope one day I can do this
with my own children.

734
00:50:40,538 --> 00:50:42,789
Where'd you get that?

735
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,667
Well, I went over
to the snowman shop.

736
00:50:47,503 --> 00:50:49,045
Hey, an assassin!

737
00:50:49,505 --> 00:50:51,089
I'll protect you!

738
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:54,342
I shall die for you.
You shall not take her!

739
00:50:54,552 --> 00:50:55,844
Find cover!

740
00:50:58,180 --> 00:51:00,515
I'm getting some good ones.

741
00:51:00,725 --> 00:51:03,601
That's a boy! Good try.

742
00:51:03,811 --> 00:51:05,478
Help me!

743
00:52:01,452 --> 00:52:02,619
What?

744
00:52:02,870 --> 00:52:06,915
I'm just amazed,
and I'm not easily amazed.

745
00:52:07,166 --> 00:52:08,583
About what?

746
00:52:08,834 --> 00:52:11,586
How you can start a day with one
kind of expectation...

747
00:52:11,796 --> 00:52:13,880
...and end up
so completely different.

748
00:52:15,299 --> 00:52:18,468
Do you like the way
this day is turning out?

749
00:52:18,677 --> 00:52:21,095
I like it very much.

750
00:52:21,347 --> 00:52:24,849
It's a perfect day.
You couldn't plan a day like this.

751
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:26,351
Well, you can.

752
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:29,562
It just takes an awful lot of work.

753
00:52:29,814 --> 00:52:32,023
Come in.
I want to show you something.

754
00:52:32,233 --> 00:52:34,526
-I don't think I should.
-I agree.

755
00:52:34,777 --> 00:52:39,113
That's why I'll show you one thing,
then kick you right out.

756
00:52:47,289 --> 00:52:49,541
It's just lovely.

757
00:52:59,927 --> 00:53:02,679
Would you like to sit
and stare at the fake fire?

758
00:53:07,351 --> 00:53:09,561
It's a really wonderful room.

759
00:53:09,812 --> 00:53:11,646
It is now.

760
00:53:18,571 --> 00:53:21,030
I don't think we should do this.

761
00:53:21,282 --> 00:53:22,907
I don't either.

762
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:28,329
On second thought,
I think we should.

763
00:53:29,164 --> 00:53:32,333
It's the perfect end
to a perfect day.

764
00:53:32,918 --> 00:53:35,837
Well, it's a little fast for me.

765
00:53:36,088 --> 00:53:37,505
Me too.

766
00:53:37,965 --> 00:53:40,216
Maybe I should go.

767
00:53:40,426 --> 00:53:42,343
Where would you go?

768
00:53:42,595 --> 00:53:43,970
Why?

769
00:53:44,179 --> 00:53:46,472
We've got a perfect fire.

770
00:53:46,765 --> 00:53:49,809
I've got some French poetry here.
Baudelaire....

771
00:53:51,353 --> 00:53:52,854
I will read to you.

772
00:53:53,606 --> 00:53:57,734
I've got some ice cream on
the windowsill. Hold on a minute.

773
00:54:03,365 --> 00:54:04,407
Rocky road.

774
00:54:04,658 --> 00:54:06,200
I love rocky road.

775
00:54:06,452 --> 00:54:08,369
Yeah, I thought so.

776
00:54:08,662 --> 00:54:10,371
You have to stay.

777
00:54:10,623 --> 00:54:14,417
No, really, I'm tired.
We can see each other tomorrow.

778
00:54:14,668 --> 00:54:18,421
No, tonight.
It's got to be tonight.

779
00:54:18,631 --> 00:54:21,507
No, Phil, really.

780
00:54:22,426 --> 00:54:25,678
Just stay for a while and
if you like it, stay longer.

781
00:54:25,888 --> 00:54:28,014
And if you like that, stay longer.

782
00:54:28,223 --> 00:54:30,099
Let's not spoil it, okay?

783
00:54:30,351 --> 00:54:32,769
I don't want to spoil it either.

784
00:54:32,978 --> 00:54:35,897
You know I can't stay with you.

785
00:54:36,148 --> 00:54:39,233
Why not? I love you.

786
00:54:41,278 --> 00:54:43,404
You love me?

787
00:54:43,656 --> 00:54:47,784
-You don't even know me.
-I know you.

788
00:54:49,328 --> 00:54:52,288
Oh, no. I can't believe
I fell for this!

789
00:54:52,539 --> 00:54:54,916
This whole day has been
one long setup.

790
00:54:55,084 --> 00:54:56,125
No, it hasn't.

791
00:54:56,377 --> 00:54:59,128
And I ate fudge. Yuck!

792
00:54:59,421 --> 00:55:01,464
No white chocolate, no fudge.

793
00:55:02,049 --> 00:55:05,468
What are you doing?
Are you making some kind of list?

794
00:55:05,678 --> 00:55:08,888
Did you call my friends
and ask them what I like?

795
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:12,642
-Is this what love is for you?
-This is real. This is love.

796
00:55:12,851 --> 00:55:14,310
Stop saying that!

797
00:55:14,937 --> 00:55:16,479
You must be crazy.

798
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:20,441
I could never love you because
you'll never love anyone but yourself.

799
00:55:20,985 --> 00:55:24,570
I don't even like myself.
Give me another chance.

800
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:28,866
That's for making me
care about you.

801
00:55:35,833 --> 00:55:38,292
I haven't done this
since I was a kid.

802
00:55:38,502 --> 00:55:39,544
It's fun!

803
00:55:39,753 --> 00:55:44,090
And good, clean fun too.
That's what's missing in the world.

804
00:55:44,341 --> 00:55:47,051
I can't wait to do this
with my own children.

805
00:55:47,261 --> 00:55:48,803
I want lots of kids!

806
00:55:49,054 --> 00:55:52,890
I want to adopt, I want my own kids,
I want to have foster kids.

807
00:55:53,142 --> 00:55:55,393
I got this at Snowman City.

808
00:55:55,644 --> 00:55:58,479
Hey! Some kid just
threw a snowball at us.

809
00:55:58,731 --> 00:56:01,566
Come here! Let's have some fun!

810
00:56:03,777 --> 00:56:06,571
I wish these were my own kids.

811
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:11,826
Are any of you up for adoption?

812
00:56:12,536 --> 00:56:14,954
Here's a humdinger over here!

813
00:56:15,205 --> 00:56:17,248
Wasn't that great?

814
00:56:25,674 --> 00:56:27,300
Stop it!

815
00:57:12,096 --> 00:57:14,097
Phil! Over here!

816
00:57:16,475 --> 00:57:19,102
Where have you been?
You're missing the fun.

817
00:57:19,353 --> 00:57:21,229
Phil, you look terrible.

818
00:57:21,897 --> 00:57:24,398
What happened? Rough night?

819
00:57:42,626 --> 00:57:44,293
Okay, campers.

820
00:57:44,711 --> 00:57:46,546
Rise and shine.

821
00:57:48,465 --> 00:57:52,135
Don't forget your booties,
because it's cold out there.

822
00:57:53,053 --> 00:57:55,471
It's cold out there every day.

823
00:57:56,181 --> 00:58:00,017
This country's largest lake,
Chapala, is located near Guadalajara.

824
00:58:01,186 --> 00:58:02,270
What is Mexico?

825
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:03,521
What is Mexico?

826
00:58:03,856 --> 00:58:05,690
-Correct.
-Lakes and Rivers, 400.

827
00:58:05,941 --> 00:58:08,609
Seneca is the largest
of these lakes.

828
00:58:09,278 --> 00:58:10,778
What are the Finger Lakes?

829
00:58:10,988 --> 00:58:13,948
-What are the Finger Lakes?
-Correct.

830
00:58:14,158 --> 00:58:18,327
-This lake in Bolivia--
-What is Titicaca?

831
00:58:18,579 --> 00:58:20,329
-What is Titicaca?
-Correct.

832
00:58:20,497 --> 00:58:21,539
For 1000.

833
00:58:21,707 --> 00:58:23,624
-Milky-colored--
-The Rhone.

834
00:58:23,876 --> 00:58:25,501
...when entering Lake Geneva...

835
00:58:25,752 --> 00:58:28,296
...this river is
clear blue upon exiting.

836
00:58:28,463 --> 00:58:29,505
-Jim?
-The Rhone.

837
00:58:29,715 --> 00:58:31,048
Good for $1000.

838
00:58:31,300 --> 00:58:33,718
You're $500 off the lead right now.

839
00:58:36,513 --> 00:58:38,181
This is pitiful.

840
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:39,932
A thousand people...

841
00:58:40,184 --> 00:58:43,186
...freezing their butts off,
waiting to worship a rat.

842
00:58:43,395 --> 00:58:44,979
What a hype.

843
00:58:45,647 --> 00:58:49,692
They used to pull the hog out,
and they used to eat it.

844
00:58:49,902 --> 00:58:53,029
You're hypocrites! All of you!

845
00:58:55,324 --> 00:58:56,866
You got a problem, Larry?

846
00:58:58,327 --> 00:59:03,164
Untie your tongue. Come here and talk.
Am I upsetting you, princess?

847
00:59:03,373 --> 00:59:05,249
You want a prediction
about the weather?

848
00:59:05,417 --> 00:59:08,085
You're asking the wrong Phil.

849
00:59:08,337 --> 00:59:11,005
I'll give you a winter prediction.

850
00:59:11,256 --> 00:59:13,299
It's going to be cold.

851
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:15,760
It's going to be gray.

852
00:59:15,969 --> 00:59:20,765
And it's going to last you
for the rest of your life.

853
00:59:55,592 --> 00:59:59,345
Once again the eyes of the nation
have turned here...

854
00:59:59,846 --> 01:00:03,099
...to this tiny village
in Western Pennsylvania.

855
01:00:03,308 --> 01:00:06,227
There is no way that this winter...

856
01:00:06,478 --> 01:00:09,355
...is ever going to end...

857
01:00:09,564 --> 01:00:13,526
...as long as this groundhog
keeps seeing his shadow.

858
01:00:13,777 --> 01:00:15,653
I don't see any other way out.

859
01:00:16,446 --> 01:00:18,322
He's got to be stopped.

860
01:00:19,825 --> 01:00:21,200
And I have to stop him.

861
01:00:23,745 --> 01:00:26,080
Real good, Phil.
Real good.

862
01:00:27,666 --> 01:00:29,250
He's out of his gourd.

863
01:00:33,922 --> 01:00:37,300
I'm worried. There's something
really wrong with Phil.

864
01:00:37,551 --> 01:00:40,219
There's a lot of things
wrong with Phil.

865
01:00:42,389 --> 01:00:43,639
Hi, Phil.

866
01:00:44,057 --> 01:00:46,183
I've come to the end of me.

867
01:00:46,435 --> 01:00:48,561
There's no way out now.

868
01:00:50,022 --> 01:00:53,357
Just remember, we had
a beautiful day together once.

869
01:00:56,778 --> 01:00:58,195
All right, little fellow.

870
01:00:58,447 --> 01:01:01,824
Good job. He just smiled at me!
Did you see that?

871
01:01:02,075 --> 01:01:03,576
I believe he did.

872
01:01:04,494 --> 01:01:07,330
Okay, little fellow.
There you go.

873
01:01:09,333 --> 01:01:11,709
Hi, there. Something I can
do you for?

874
01:01:14,296 --> 01:01:16,213
Hey! What are you doing?

875
01:01:20,969 --> 01:01:23,012
Get the word out.
Somebody kidnapped Phil!

876
01:01:23,388 --> 01:01:24,722
We are going after him!

877
01:01:31,396 --> 01:01:33,814
Why would anybody
steal a groundhog?

878
01:01:34,274 --> 01:01:36,067
I could think of reasons.

879
01:01:36,234 --> 01:01:37,276
Pervert.

880
01:02:03,303 --> 01:02:05,096
He must have just snapped!

881
01:02:05,305 --> 01:02:06,639
This ought to be good.

882
01:02:09,017 --> 01:02:10,267
What is he doing?

883
01:02:10,477 --> 01:02:12,019
What can he be thinking?

884
01:02:12,687 --> 01:02:14,271
Not bad for a quadruped.

885
01:02:14,523 --> 01:02:18,442
Check your mirrors. Side of your eye.
Side of your eye.

886
01:02:24,491 --> 01:02:25,991
That's it.

887
01:02:26,243 --> 01:02:29,286
Hey, they're chasing us!
Come on, make it fun.

888
01:02:37,504 --> 01:02:38,671
Don't drive angry.

889
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:40,089
Don't drive angry.

890
01:03:00,110 --> 01:03:02,987
There's no way out
except the way we came in!

891
01:03:03,238 --> 01:03:04,697
We got him now!

892
01:03:24,009 --> 01:03:25,217
What is he doing?

893
01:03:25,427 --> 01:03:26,469
I don't know.

894
01:03:30,807 --> 01:03:33,601
If you got to shoot,
don't hit the groundhog.

895
01:03:38,398 --> 01:03:40,149
Mustn't keep them waiting.

896
01:03:43,487 --> 01:03:44,820
It's showtime.

897
01:03:51,203 --> 01:03:52,495
On me in three...

898
01:03:54,789 --> 01:03:56,248
...two...

899
01:03:57,375 --> 01:03:58,417
...one.

900
01:04:12,140 --> 01:04:13,182
Phil!

901
01:04:15,519 --> 01:04:16,894
He might be okay.

902
01:04:21,525 --> 01:04:24,068
Well, no. Probably not now.

903
01:04:39,709 --> 01:04:40,960
Nuts.

904
01:04:48,885 --> 01:04:51,804
Did you sleep well, Mr. Connors?

905
01:04:52,847 --> 01:04:54,515
Would you like...

906
01:04:55,141 --> 01:04:56,559
...some toast?

907
01:05:14,911 --> 01:05:16,996
Oh, my God!

908
01:05:49,571 --> 01:05:50,946
That's him.

909
01:05:54,117 --> 01:05:57,536
He was a really, really great guy.

910
01:05:57,787 --> 01:05:59,496
I really, really liked him...

911
01:05:59,914 --> 01:06:00,956
...a lot.

912
01:06:08,298 --> 01:06:10,299
I'm sorry?
What was that again?

913
01:06:10,717 --> 01:06:13,469
-I'm a god.
-You're God?

914
01:06:13,678 --> 01:06:16,930
I'm a god. I'm not the God,
I don't think.

915
01:06:17,515 --> 01:06:19,642
Because you survived a car wreck?

916
01:06:19,809 --> 01:06:21,060
You folks ready to order?

917
01:06:21,269 --> 01:06:24,480
I didn't just survive a wreck.
I wasn't just blown up.

918
01:06:24,898 --> 01:06:27,483
I have been stabbed,
shot, poisoned...

919
01:06:27,692 --> 01:06:31,028
...frozen, hung, electrocuted
and burned.

920
01:06:31,237 --> 01:06:32,571
Oh, really?

921
01:06:32,822 --> 01:06:37,034
Every morning I wake up without a
scratch, not a dent in the fender.

922
01:06:37,744 --> 01:06:38,827
I am an immortal.

923
01:06:39,037 --> 01:06:41,664
Special today is blueberry waffles.

924
01:06:41,873 --> 01:06:43,707
Why are you telling me this?

925
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,126
Because I want you to believe in me.

926
01:06:46,336 --> 01:06:47,670
You are not a god.

927
01:06:47,879 --> 01:06:51,298
Take my word. It's 12 years
of Catholic school talking.

928
01:06:51,841 --> 01:06:53,801
I can come back if you're not ready.

929
01:06:54,010 --> 01:06:56,011
How do you know I'm not a god?

930
01:06:56,221 --> 01:06:57,471
Please.

931
01:06:57,722 --> 01:07:00,057
-How do you know?
-It's not possible.

932
01:07:00,266 --> 01:07:02,017
I'll come back.

933
01:07:02,352 --> 01:07:03,602
Doris.

934
01:07:07,023 --> 01:07:09,608
This is Doris.
Her brother-in-law owns this diner.

935
01:07:09,859 --> 01:07:13,529
She's worked here since she was 17.
She wants to see Paris...

936
01:07:13,738 --> 01:07:14,947
...before she dies.

937
01:07:15,115 --> 01:07:16,156
Boy, would I!

938
01:07:16,324 --> 01:07:18,992
-What are you doing?
-Debbie and her fiancé.

939
01:07:19,244 --> 01:07:20,494
Do I know you?

940
01:07:20,662 --> 01:07:23,664
They're supposed to get married.
She's having second thoughts.

941
01:07:23,832 --> 01:07:24,998
What?

942
01:07:25,250 --> 01:07:26,375
Lovely ring.

943
01:07:26,626 --> 01:07:31,463
Bill's been a waiter three years,
since he left Penn State to work.

944
01:07:31,715 --> 01:07:34,800
He likes the town,
paints toy soldiers and he's gay.

945
01:07:35,009 --> 01:07:36,051
I am.

946
01:07:36,678 --> 01:07:39,430
Gus hates it here,
wishes he'd stayed in the Navy.

947
01:07:39,681 --> 01:07:42,224
I could've retired
on half pay after 20 years.

948
01:07:42,475 --> 01:07:44,309
Excuse me. Is this a trick?

949
01:07:44,561 --> 01:07:48,397
Maybe the real God uses tricks.
Maybe he's not omnipotent...

950
01:07:48,648 --> 01:07:50,566
...he just knows everything.

951
01:07:50,817 --> 01:07:52,151
-Who's that?
-Tom.

952
01:07:52,402 --> 01:07:54,403
He worked in the coal mine
till it closed.

953
01:07:54,612 --> 01:07:55,779
-And her?
-Alice.

954
01:07:56,030 --> 01:07:58,532
Came from Ireland when she
was a baby. Lived in Erie.

955
01:07:58,700 --> 01:07:59,742
He's right.

956
01:07:59,909 --> 01:08:01,285
-And her?
-Nancy.

957
01:08:01,536 --> 01:08:05,497
Works in a shop, makes noises like
a chipmunk when she gets excited.

958
01:08:05,749 --> 01:08:07,458
-It's true.
-How do you know this?

959
01:08:07,709 --> 01:08:09,418
I told you, I know everything.

960
01:08:09,669 --> 01:08:12,546
In five seconds, a waiter
will drop a tray.

961
01:08:12,756 --> 01:08:15,507
-Five, four, three, two, one.
-This is nuts.

962
01:08:17,844 --> 01:08:20,262
-Okay?
-Okay, that's enough.

963
01:08:21,306 --> 01:08:23,515
What about me?
Do you know me too?

964
01:08:23,767 --> 01:08:27,978
I know all about you. You hope
for more than Channel 9 Pittsburgh.

965
01:08:28,188 --> 01:08:30,606
Well, everyone knows that.

966
01:08:30,982 --> 01:08:33,567
You like boats but not the ocean.

967
01:08:33,985 --> 01:08:37,362
You go to a lake in the summer
with your family.

968
01:08:37,614 --> 01:08:41,533
There's a dock and a boathouse
with boards missing from the roof...

969
01:08:42,243 --> 01:08:45,162
...and a place you used to
crawl underneath to be alone.

970
01:08:45,789 --> 01:08:49,041
You're a sucker for
French poetry and rhinestones.

971
01:08:49,751 --> 01:08:51,168
You're very generous.

972
01:08:51,419 --> 01:08:53,921
You're kind to strangers
and children.

973
01:08:54,464 --> 01:08:57,299
When you stand in the snow
you look like an angel.

974
01:08:57,759 --> 01:08:59,301
How are you doing this?

975
01:09:00,386 --> 01:09:03,347
I told you. I wake up every day.

976
01:09:03,598 --> 01:09:05,265
Right here.

977
01:09:05,475 --> 01:09:08,894
Right in Punxsutawney.
And it's always February 2nd.

978
01:09:09,896 --> 01:09:12,397
And there's nothing
I can do about it.

979
01:09:13,107 --> 01:09:16,193
If you still can't believe me, listen:

980
01:09:16,444 --> 01:09:18,445
In 10 seconds...

981
01:09:18,947 --> 01:09:22,407
...Larry is going to come
and take you away from me.

982
01:09:22,659 --> 01:09:24,493
But you can't let him.

983
01:09:25,495 --> 01:09:28,539
Please believe me.
You've got to believe me.

984
01:09:33,628 --> 01:09:37,631
You guys ready? We better go,
to stay ahead of the weather.

985
01:09:38,258 --> 01:09:39,508
What's that?

986
01:09:40,426 --> 01:09:42,845
"--to stay ahead of the weather."

987
01:09:48,351 --> 01:09:52,437
Maybe it really is happening.
How else could you know so much?

988
01:09:52,647 --> 01:09:55,148
There is no way.
I'm not that smart.

989
01:09:56,276 --> 01:09:58,527
Maybe I should
spend the day with you...

990
01:09:58,778 --> 01:10:02,239
...as an objective witness,
just to see what happens.

991
01:10:02,490 --> 01:10:04,950
This sounds like a science project.

992
01:10:06,077 --> 01:10:07,286
Concentrate.

993
01:10:07,537 --> 01:10:09,329
You got to want it.

994
01:10:09,789 --> 01:10:11,874
You got to want it, Rita.

995
01:10:12,333 --> 01:10:16,211
Come on. It's more
in the wrist than the fingers.

996
01:10:24,512 --> 01:10:26,346
Be the hat. Come on, go.

997
01:10:26,598 --> 01:10:29,558
-It'd take me a year to get good.
-Six months.

998
01:10:29,809 --> 01:10:33,061
Four to five hours a day,
and you'd be an expert.

999
01:10:33,563 --> 01:10:37,190
-Is this what you do with eternity?
-Now you know.

1000
01:10:38,610 --> 01:10:40,652
That's not the worst part.

1001
01:10:40,904 --> 01:10:42,321
What's the worst part?

1002
01:10:42,572 --> 01:10:44,573
The worst part is that...

1003
01:10:44,782 --> 01:10:47,326
...tomorrow you'll have
forgotten all about this...

1004
01:10:47,577 --> 01:10:49,786
...and you'll treat me
like a jerk again.

1005
01:10:50,914 --> 01:10:52,372
I am a jerk.

1006
01:10:52,582 --> 01:10:54,416
No, you're not.

1007
01:10:54,792 --> 01:10:59,296
It doesn't make any difference.
I've killed myself so many times...

1008
01:10:59,547 --> 01:11:01,256
... I don't even exist anymore.

1009
01:11:01,841 --> 01:11:04,593
Sometimes I wish I had
a thousand lifetimes.

1010
01:11:05,178 --> 01:11:08,180
I don't know.
Maybe it's not a curse.

1011
01:11:08,431 --> 01:11:11,058
It just depends
on how you look at it.

1012
01:11:12,602 --> 01:11:14,811
Gosh, you're an upbeat lady!

1013
01:11:18,107 --> 01:11:21,276
I want you to know it's been
a really nice day for me.

1014
01:11:21,444 --> 01:11:22,486
Me too.

1015
01:11:22,654 --> 01:11:23,820
And maybe...

1016
01:11:24,072 --> 01:11:27,741
...if it's not too boring,
we can do it again sometime.

1017
01:11:27,992 --> 01:11:29,409
I hope so.

1018
01:11:41,589 --> 01:11:43,382
You're still here.

1019
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:48,595
I thought you were supposed
to disappear. Or I was.

1020
01:11:48,846 --> 01:11:50,514
Not until 6.

1021
01:11:51,391 --> 01:11:52,808
You rat!

1022
01:11:53,059 --> 01:11:54,893
I never said midnight.

1023
01:11:55,228 --> 01:11:57,688
You knew I was waiting for midnight.

1024
01:11:58,481 --> 01:11:59,898
Are you going to leave?

1025
01:12:01,734 --> 01:12:03,026
No.

1026
01:12:03,695 --> 01:12:04,820
Good.

1027
01:12:15,498 --> 01:12:17,165
I'm sorry.

1028
01:12:18,668 --> 01:12:20,919
It's all right.
You can fall asleep.

1029
01:12:21,921 --> 01:12:24,256
I promise I won't touch you.

1030
01:12:24,966 --> 01:12:26,216
Much.

1031
01:12:27,552 --> 01:12:30,303
It's all right. I'm not tired.

1032
01:12:31,139 --> 01:12:32,806
What were you saying?

1033
01:12:34,225 --> 01:12:37,519
I think the last thing
that you heard was:

1034
01:12:37,770 --> 01:12:40,439
"Only God could make a tree."

1035
01:12:40,690 --> 01:12:41,773
Really?

1036
01:13:19,937 --> 01:13:22,230
What I wanted to say was...

1037
01:13:23,983 --> 01:13:26,109
... I think you are the kindest...

1038
01:13:26,360 --> 01:13:28,904
...sweetest, prettiest person...

1039
01:13:29,405 --> 01:13:31,406
... I've ever met in my life.

1040
01:13:32,950 --> 01:13:35,160
I've never seen anyone...

1041
01:13:35,787 --> 01:13:38,288
...that's nicer to people
than you are.

1042
01:13:51,260 --> 01:13:53,303
And the first time I saw you...

1043
01:13:54,388 --> 01:13:56,640
...something happened to me.

1044
01:13:57,892 --> 01:14:00,018
I never told you...

1045
01:14:03,397 --> 01:14:05,816
...but I knew I wanted
to hold you...

1046
01:14:06,025 --> 01:14:07,901
...as hard as I could.

1047
01:14:20,873 --> 01:14:23,333
I don't deserve someone like you.

1048
01:14:27,171 --> 01:14:28,964
But if I ever could...

1049
01:14:30,424 --> 01:14:32,509
... I swear I would love you...

1050
01:14:32,885 --> 01:14:35,011
...for the rest of my life.

1051
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:41,476
Did you say something?

1052
01:14:47,191 --> 01:14:48,775
Good night, Rita.

1053
01:14:49,986 --> 01:14:51,570
Good night, Phil.

1054
01:15:16,512 --> 01:15:19,848
Campers, rise and shine!
Don't forget your booties.

1055
01:15:20,057 --> 01:15:23,101
-It's cold out there!
-It's cold every day.

1056
01:15:23,311 --> 01:15:25,604
-Is this Miami Beach?
-Not hardly!

1057
01:16:01,015 --> 01:16:03,475
Who wants coffee?
Get it while it's hot.

1058
01:16:04,352 --> 01:16:06,561
-Thanks, Phil.
-Larry?

1059
01:16:06,812 --> 01:16:08,897
Skim milk, two sugar.

1060
01:16:09,148 --> 01:16:10,482
Thanks, Phil.

1061
01:16:10,691 --> 01:16:11,858
Pastry?

1062
01:16:12,109 --> 01:16:13,276
We're setting up.

1063
01:16:13,486 --> 01:16:15,278
Pastry, Larry?
Take your pick.

1064
01:16:16,530 --> 01:16:18,573
Thanks. Raspberry. Great.

1065
01:16:19,075 --> 01:16:22,244
I talked with Buster Green,
the head groundhog honcho.

1066
01:16:22,495 --> 01:16:25,288
He said if we set up here
we'll get a better shot.

1067
01:16:25,748 --> 01:16:27,999
-What do you think?
-Sounds good.

1068
01:16:28,334 --> 01:16:29,542
Larry?

1069
01:16:30,836 --> 01:16:32,754
Yeah. Let's go for it.

1070
01:16:33,005 --> 01:16:34,047
Good work, Phil.

1071
01:16:34,715 --> 01:16:38,051
Maybe we'll get lucky.
Let me give you a hand.

1072
01:16:39,512 --> 01:16:42,430
No, no. You got your coffee.
I'll get it.

1073
01:16:43,724 --> 01:16:45,600
We never talk.
Do you have kids?

1074
01:17:20,386 --> 01:17:22,220
I'd like a piano lesson.

1075
01:17:22,555 --> 01:17:26,516
I'm with a student. But if you
want to come back tomorrow--

1076
01:17:26,726 --> 01:17:29,978
I kind of want to get started.
I can give you $1000.

1077
01:17:32,606 --> 01:17:33,648
Come on in.

1078
01:17:53,210 --> 01:17:55,253
Morning!
Off to see the groundhog?

1079
01:17:58,507 --> 01:18:00,967
Think it'll be an early spring?

1080
01:18:01,218 --> 01:18:03,595
Winter, slumbering in the open air

1081
01:18:03,846 --> 01:18:05,472
Wears on his smiling face

1082
01:18:05,723 --> 01:18:07,932
A dream of spring

1083
01:18:08,184 --> 01:18:09,225
Ciao!

1084
01:18:10,519 --> 01:18:11,728
Ciao!

1085
01:18:49,850 --> 01:18:51,101
How does she look?

1086
01:18:51,394 --> 01:18:52,477
Great.

1087
01:18:52,853 --> 01:18:53,895
Thank you.

1088
01:18:54,105 --> 01:18:57,565
-Did you know he could ice sculpt?
-No.

1089
01:19:11,622 --> 01:19:14,833
Not bad. You say
this is your first lesson?

1090
01:19:15,793 --> 01:19:19,045
Yes, but my father
was a piano mover, so....

1091
01:19:24,969 --> 01:19:29,472
-Phil Connors, I thought it was you.
-Ned Ryerson.

1092
01:19:31,183 --> 01:19:33,726
I have missed you so much.

1093
01:19:38,107 --> 01:19:41,651
I don't know where you're headed,
but can you call in sick?

1094
01:19:45,072 --> 01:19:46,990
I got to get going.

1095
01:19:47,867 --> 01:19:49,909
It's good to see you, Phil.

1096
01:20:08,012 --> 01:20:09,471
Hello, father.

1097
01:20:10,222 --> 01:20:11,931
Let's get you someplace warm.

1098
01:20:13,767 --> 01:20:15,143
Remember me?

1099
01:20:21,984 --> 01:20:23,693
You brought the old man in?

1100
01:20:23,903 --> 01:20:24,944
How is he?

1101
01:20:25,654 --> 01:20:27,655
He just passed away.

1102
01:20:29,408 --> 01:20:32,452
-What did he die of?
-He was just old.

1103
01:20:32,703 --> 01:20:34,537
It was just his time.

1104
01:20:37,291 --> 01:20:40,293
-I want to see his chart. Excuse me.
-Sir!

1105
01:20:40,669 --> 01:20:42,295
You can't come in here.

1106
01:20:42,546 --> 01:20:45,173
Sir, this is a restricted area.

1107
01:20:54,350 --> 01:20:56,017
Where's the chart?

1108
01:20:56,519 --> 01:20:58,853
Sometimes people just die.

1109
01:20:59,772 --> 01:21:01,231
Not today.

1110
01:21:13,619 --> 01:21:15,828
Gets hard down there at the bottom.

1111
01:21:18,749 --> 01:21:19,958
Here you go.

1112
01:21:20,292 --> 01:21:21,417
Thank you.

1113
01:21:25,839 --> 01:21:26,923
Come on, dad.

1114
01:21:27,174 --> 01:21:28,550
Come on, pop.

1115
01:21:30,511 --> 01:21:32,303
Come on. Come on, breathe.

1116
01:21:32,555 --> 01:21:35,223
Breathe, pop! Breathe, pop!

1117
01:22:00,958 --> 01:22:03,626
When Chekhov saw the long winter...

1118
01:22:04,086 --> 01:22:07,463
...he saw a winter bleak
and dark and bereft of hope.

1119
01:22:07,715 --> 01:22:12,385
Yet we know winter is just
another step in the cycle of life.

1120
01:22:12,636 --> 01:22:16,306
But standing here among
the people of Punxsutawney...

1121
01:22:16,515 --> 01:22:19,350
...and basking in the warmth
of their hearths and hearts...

1122
01:22:20,436 --> 01:22:22,729
... I couldn't imagine a better fate...

1123
01:22:22,938 --> 01:22:25,898
...than a long and lustrous winter.

1124
01:22:26,150 --> 01:22:28,943
From Punxsutawney, it's Phil Connors.

1125
01:22:29,194 --> 01:22:30,486
So long.

1126
01:22:32,364 --> 01:22:34,073
Nice speech. Very nice.

1127
01:22:34,325 --> 01:22:35,491
Thank you.

1128
01:22:36,827 --> 01:22:40,079
-How was that for you two?
-My man, you touched me.

1129
01:22:40,331 --> 01:22:41,998
-Thanks, Larry.
-Thank you.

1130
01:22:43,375 --> 01:22:44,584
I got to go.

1131
01:22:45,878 --> 01:22:49,922
That was surprising.
I didn't know you were so versatile.

1132
01:22:50,174 --> 01:22:51,841
I surprise myself sometimes.

1133
01:22:52,051 --> 01:22:54,052
Would you like a cup of coffee?

1134
01:22:54,261 --> 01:22:58,222
I'd love to. Can I have a rain check?
I've got some errands.

1135
01:23:01,977 --> 01:23:03,895
Errands? What errands?

1136
01:23:04,146 --> 01:23:06,356
I thought we were going back.

1137
01:23:23,999 --> 01:23:26,834
What do you say?
What do you say?

1138
01:23:27,044 --> 01:23:29,921
You little brat.
You have never thanked me!

1139
01:23:30,631 --> 01:23:32,256
I'll see you tomorrow...

1140
01:23:32,508 --> 01:23:33,591
...maybe.

1141
01:23:41,308 --> 01:23:43,643
You totaled it.

1142
01:23:43,852 --> 01:23:47,980
-It's only a flat tire.
-What are we going to do?

1143
01:23:49,358 --> 01:23:52,777
-It's an earthquake!
-It's not an earthquake.

1144
01:23:52,986 --> 01:23:54,028
What is it?

1145
01:23:57,574 --> 01:23:59,659
Thank you, young man.

1146
01:24:00,786 --> 01:24:03,162
It's nothing.
I had the tire and the jack.

1147
01:24:03,414 --> 01:24:06,040
Just be comfortable.
It'll be a minute.

1148
01:24:06,291 --> 01:24:07,500
Who is that?

1149
01:24:07,751 --> 01:24:10,503
He must be from the motor club.

1150
01:24:11,755 --> 01:24:14,424
He's having a heart attack!
Do something!

1151
01:24:14,675 --> 01:24:18,761
Call 411, an ambulance, a lawyer,
doctor, anything!

1152
01:24:26,019 --> 01:24:27,562
I think that did it.

1153
01:24:31,442 --> 01:24:34,318
If you're going to eat steak,
get sharper teeth.

1154
01:24:34,570 --> 01:24:36,904
-Enjoy your meal.
-Thank you.

1155
01:24:37,489 --> 01:24:38,823
Who was that?

1156
01:24:39,032 --> 01:24:41,659
-I'm fine, I'm fine.
-Are you sure?

1157
01:24:41,827 --> 01:24:42,869
Eat, eat!

1158
01:24:47,291 --> 01:24:48,833
People don't understand...

1159
01:24:49,042 --> 01:24:51,836
...what's involved.
This is an art form.

1160
01:24:52,087 --> 01:24:54,547
I think most people just think...

1161
01:24:54,798 --> 01:24:57,967
...that I hold a camera
and point it at stuff.

1162
01:24:58,218 --> 01:25:00,511
There's a lot more to it than that.

1163
01:25:02,556 --> 01:25:06,058
Would you be interested in seeing
the inside of a van?

1164
01:25:06,268 --> 01:25:09,562
You know, I really have to
get back to the party.

1165
01:25:09,813 --> 01:25:11,522
Great idea.
I'll go with you.

1166
01:25:11,774 --> 01:25:14,025
Let me just drop a tip here.

1167
01:25:20,073 --> 01:25:21,574
Hi! How are you?

1168
01:25:21,825 --> 01:25:23,618
Rita, this is Nancy.

1169
01:25:24,745 --> 01:25:26,996
We were going to the party.
You going?

1170
01:25:27,206 --> 01:25:29,832
Sounds like fun.
Maybe we should call Phil.

1171
01:25:30,918 --> 01:25:33,002
I think he's already in there.

1172
01:27:29,703 --> 01:27:30,953
Isn’t he good?

1173
01:27:31,204 --> 01:27:32,330
He's great!

1174
01:27:32,581 --> 01:27:34,206
He's my student.

1175
01:27:36,835 --> 01:27:38,711
I'm so proud.

1176
01:27:39,880 --> 01:27:41,088
Thank you.

1177
01:27:42,257 --> 01:27:44,300
Hello, welcome to our party.

1178
01:27:44,551 --> 01:27:46,802
I didn't know you could
play like that.

1179
01:27:47,054 --> 01:27:48,763
I'm versatile.

1180
01:27:56,146 --> 01:27:59,190
It's that nice young man
from the motor club.

1181
01:27:59,399 --> 01:28:00,900
Thank you again.

1182
01:28:01,151 --> 01:28:02,568
It's nothing, ladies.

1183
01:28:02,819 --> 01:28:06,072
He's the fastest jack
in Jefferson County.

1184
01:28:08,533 --> 01:28:10,159
What was that all about?

1185
01:28:10,410 --> 01:28:13,496
Don't know. They've been
hitting on me all night.

1186
01:28:14,373 --> 01:28:15,748
There you are!

1187
01:28:17,709 --> 01:28:20,920
I never thanked you properly
for what you did.

1188
01:28:21,171 --> 01:28:23,214
He would've choked for sure.

1189
01:28:23,465 --> 01:28:27,176
He may have. He was trying
to swallow a whole cow.

1190
01:28:27,427 --> 01:28:28,636
I owe you one, buddy.

1191
01:28:28,887 --> 01:28:32,014
Hang on to him, dear.
He's a real find.

1192
01:28:34,434 --> 01:28:36,143
What did you do today?

1193
01:28:36,395 --> 01:28:37,979
Same old, same old.

1194
01:28:43,735 --> 01:28:45,277
Excuse me, Mr. Connors.

1195
01:28:45,487 --> 01:28:47,071
Fred, how was the wedding?

1196
01:28:47,322 --> 01:28:50,324
Thank you for making
Debbie go through with it.

1197
01:28:50,575 --> 01:28:53,619
All I did was fan her flame
of passion for you.

1198
01:28:53,870 --> 01:28:55,079
You are the best.

1199
01:28:55,330 --> 01:28:56,372
No, you are.

1200
01:28:56,623 --> 01:28:59,792
Rita, this is
Debbie and Fred Kleiser.

1201
01:29:00,043 --> 01:29:03,879
-Here you go, kids. Congratulations.
-What is this?

1202
01:29:04,339 --> 01:29:06,173
No way!

1203
01:29:06,425 --> 01:29:09,552
WrestleMania!
No way!

1204
01:29:10,512 --> 01:29:13,472
How'd you know?
We'll be in Pittsburgh anyway!

1205
01:29:13,724 --> 01:29:15,558
Thank you. You're a real pal.

1206
01:29:15,809 --> 01:29:17,685
Oh, this is the best.

1207
01:29:22,482 --> 01:29:23,899
I don't understand.

1208
01:29:24,151 --> 01:29:25,860
I guess not.

1209
01:29:26,361 --> 01:29:29,113
How does everyone know you?
You come once a year.

1210
01:29:29,364 --> 01:29:31,198
You're the most popular
person in town.

1211
01:29:31,450 --> 01:29:33,659
Excuse me, Dr. Connors?

1212
01:29:33,869 --> 01:29:36,787
I want to thank you
for fixing Felix's back.

1213
01:29:36,997 --> 01:29:39,081
He can help around the house again.

1214
01:29:39,291 --> 01:29:41,792
Well, I'm sorry
to hear that, Felix.

1215
01:29:44,171 --> 01:29:45,796
Dr. Connors?

1216
01:29:46,173 --> 01:29:48,507
It's kind of an honorary title.

1217
01:29:48,759 --> 01:29:50,342
What is going on?

1218
01:29:50,552 --> 01:29:51,594
I really don't know.

1219
01:29:51,845 --> 01:29:54,305
There is something
going on with you.

1220
01:29:54,890 --> 01:29:56,849
You want the long or short version?

1221
01:29:57,100 --> 01:29:59,935
Let's start with the short
and go from there.

1222
01:30:05,734 --> 01:30:07,735
Okay, folks, attention.

1223
01:30:08,528 --> 01:30:11,655
Time for the bachelor auction.
You know the rules.

1224
01:30:11,907 --> 01:30:14,366
All the eligible bachelors
come in front.

1225
01:30:14,659 --> 01:30:16,118
And you ladies...

1226
01:30:16,369 --> 01:30:17,703
...you bid on them!

1227
01:30:17,954 --> 01:30:19,997
Do whatever you want with them...

1228
01:30:20,248 --> 01:30:21,832
...no questions asked!

1229
01:30:22,084 --> 01:30:25,169
I don't want to know about it,
as long as it's legal.

1230
01:30:25,378 --> 01:30:29,757
Get out your pocketbooks,
and remember it's all for charity.

1231
01:30:31,927 --> 01:30:33,511
What are you doing down here?

1232
01:30:33,762 --> 01:30:35,262
Go on, get up there.

1233
01:30:35,472 --> 01:30:38,557
I got 10 bucks
that says you're mine.

1234
01:30:38,975 --> 01:30:40,893
Buster, I got your first victim.

1235
01:30:41,103 --> 01:30:43,771
Phil Connors, come on up here!

1236
01:30:48,819 --> 01:30:52,154
All right! Now, what am I bid
for this fine specimen?

1237
01:30:52,447 --> 01:30:53,864
Five dollars!

1238
01:30:54,074 --> 01:30:56,033
The bidding has begun
at $5.

1239
01:30:56,326 --> 01:30:57,576
Ten dollars!

1240
01:30:57,786 --> 01:30:58,994

1241
01:30:59,204 --> 01:31:01,205

-Twenty-five!

1242
01:31:01,373 --> 01:31:02,414
Thirty!

1243
01:31:02,582 --> 01:31:04,375
-Thirty-five!
-Forty!

1244
01:31:04,543 --> 01:31:05,584
Forty-five!

1245
01:31:06,253 --> 01:31:07,294
Fifty!

1246
01:31:07,504 --> 01:31:08,546
Fifty-five!

1247
01:31:08,713 --> 01:31:09,755
Sixty!

1248
01:31:09,923 --> 01:31:11,590
I'm bid $60.
Do I hear more?

1249
01:31:15,387 --> 01:31:18,556
$339.88.

1250
01:31:22,477 --> 01:31:26,313
We won't accept any more bids.
I think that's sold...

1251
01:31:26,565 --> 01:31:30,234
...to the little lady for $339.88!

1252
01:31:31,361 --> 01:31:32,736
Congratulations!

1253
01:31:40,829 --> 01:31:42,746
Okay, bachelors, who's next?

1254
01:31:53,175 --> 01:31:56,468
All right! Now, what am I
bid for this guy?

1255
01:31:56,678 --> 01:31:58,512
Do I hear a buck and a half?

1256
01:31:58,805 --> 01:32:00,055
Anybody?

1257
01:32:00,932 --> 01:32:01,974
75 cents?

1258
01:32:02,184 --> 01:32:03,976
I bid two bits!

1259
01:32:04,603 --> 01:32:06,979
Sold to the lady for 25 cents.

1260
01:32:07,189 --> 01:32:08,731
I got him!

1261
01:32:16,990 --> 01:32:19,700
Phil Connors,
I thought that was you.

1262
01:32:19,951 --> 01:32:22,411
This is Ned Ryerson,
my new insurance agent.

1263
01:32:22,662 --> 01:32:23,913
I'll say.

1264
01:32:25,123 --> 01:32:27,082
I haven't seen him for 20 years.

1265
01:32:27,334 --> 01:32:32,379
He comes up and buys whole life,
term, fire, auto, dental, health...

1266
01:32:32,589 --> 01:32:35,507
...with the optional death
and dismemberment plan.

1267
01:32:35,759 --> 01:32:37,927
This is the best day of my life.

1268
01:32:38,178 --> 01:32:40,304
-Mine too.
-Mine too.

1269
01:32:40,513 --> 01:32:41,764
Where are we going?

1270
01:32:42,015 --> 01:32:43,724
Let's not spoil it.

1271
01:32:45,268 --> 01:32:47,895
Let's not--
I got that.

1272
01:32:50,815 --> 01:32:52,233
Why can't I look?

1273
01:32:52,692 --> 01:32:54,526
Because you bother me a lot.

1274
01:32:54,819 --> 01:32:56,195
I'm getting cold.

1275
01:32:56,404 --> 01:32:58,030
How long do I have to sit here?

1276
01:32:58,657 --> 01:33:01,784
I'm giving you your money's worth.
You paid top dollar for me.

1277
01:33:02,369 --> 01:33:04,703
Well, I think you were a bargain.

1278
01:33:05,538 --> 01:33:07,665
Sweet of you to say.
You're right.

1279
01:33:10,418 --> 01:33:11,835
Is it finished yet?

1280
01:33:12,712 --> 01:33:15,589
I still have to put
cherry syrup on the top...

1281
01:33:15,799 --> 01:33:16,840
...then we can eat it.

1282
01:33:17,092 --> 01:33:19,760
Come on, Phil.
I'm freezing!

1283
01:33:19,970 --> 01:33:21,637
One second, one second.

1284
01:33:21,888 --> 01:33:23,681
Let me turn it in the light.

1285
01:33:29,187 --> 01:33:30,688
It's amazing.

1286
01:33:31,439 --> 01:33:32,690
It's beautiful.

1287
01:33:36,987 --> 01:33:38,362
How did you do that?

1288
01:33:39,197 --> 01:33:42,992
I know your face so well,
I could do it with my eyes closed.

1289
01:33:47,539 --> 01:33:48,956
It's lovely.

1290
01:33:49,708 --> 01:33:51,542
I don't know what to say.

1291
01:33:52,752 --> 01:33:53,961
I do.

1292
01:33:56,047 --> 01:33:58,340
No matter what happens tomorrow...

1293
01:33:58,591 --> 01:34:00,467
...or for the rest of my life...

1294
01:34:00,677 --> 01:34:02,386
... I'm happy now...

1295
01:34:03,596 --> 01:34:05,180
...because I love you.

1296
01:34:06,099 --> 01:34:07,891
I think I'm happy too.

1297
01:35:06,576 --> 01:35:07,743
Please. Not again.

1298
01:35:07,952 --> 01:35:09,828
-That's a great song.
-It's not.

1299
01:35:10,080 --> 01:35:12,122
Don't listen to this man--

1300
01:35:12,707 --> 01:35:15,125
It's too early.

1301
01:35:25,845 --> 01:35:27,638
Something is different.

1302
01:35:28,264 --> 01:35:29,515
Good or bad?

1303
01:35:29,891 --> 01:35:32,184
Anything different is good.

1304
01:35:34,646 --> 01:35:36,939
But this could be real good.

1305
01:35:41,820 --> 01:35:43,237
Why are you here?

1306
01:35:43,696 --> 01:35:45,781
I bought you.
I own you.

1307
01:35:48,284 --> 01:35:49,868
But why are you still here?

1308
01:35:50,120 --> 01:35:53,205
You said, "Stay,"
so I stayed.

1309
01:35:55,875 --> 01:35:57,918
I said, "Stay,"
so you stayed.

1310
01:35:58,169 --> 01:36:00,712
I can't even make a collie stay.

1311
01:36:02,882 --> 01:36:04,883
I got to check something.

1312
01:36:05,677 --> 01:36:07,052
Stay.

1313
01:36:07,470 --> 01:36:08,595
Stay.

1314
01:36:14,227 --> 01:36:15,519
They're gone!

1315
01:36:16,438 --> 01:36:18,021
They're all gone.

1316
01:36:20,108 --> 01:36:22,818
-Do you know what today is?
-No, what?

1317
01:36:24,154 --> 01:36:26,155
Today is tomorrow.

1318
01:36:26,739 --> 01:36:28,073
It happened.

1319
01:36:30,326 --> 01:36:32,578
-You're here.
-I'm here.

1320
01:36:36,749 --> 01:36:41,378
Why weren't you like this last night?
You just fell asleep.

1321
01:36:43,214 --> 01:36:46,008
It was the end of a very long day.

1322
01:36:49,095 --> 01:36:52,890
Is there anything I can do
for you today?

1323
01:36:53,766 --> 01:36:56,393
I'm sure I can think of something.

1324
01:37:29,511 --> 01:37:31,512
It's so beautiful!

1325
01:37:42,148 --> 01:37:43,774
Let's live here.
