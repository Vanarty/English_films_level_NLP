1
00:00:08,925 --> 00:00:09,967
No. Mike, stop!

2
00:00:10,093 --> 00:00:11,427
Whoa.

3
00:00:11,553 --> 00:00:13,053
- Sorry.
- Smooth.

4
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:15,347
You would have made
a nice ballerina.

5
00:00:15,473 --> 00:00:18,058
I'm not going to apologize
for my lithe physique, okay?

6
00:00:18,184 --> 00:00:21,228
And by the way, I was on the wrestling
team in high school, so...

7
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:22,938
Is something funny?

8
00:00:23,064 --> 00:00:26,567
I'm just trying to imagine
you fighting someone.

9
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:28,736
Oh.
I would kill you.

10
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:30,404
- You wouldn't touch me.
- Why not?

11
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:33,073
Because you'd be too busy
staring at me in tights.

12
00:00:33,199 --> 00:00:35,200
- No, I wouldn't.
- You're doing it right now.

13
00:00:35,326 --> 00:00:36,493
You're not wearing
any tights.

14
00:00:36,619 --> 00:00:38,245
I'm not
wearing any underwear.

15
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:39,872
I'm... You...

16
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:47,671
Okay. So, Mrs. Williams, we're going
to take you to the deposition

17
00:00:47,797 --> 00:00:50,382
as soon as Kenny Verdasco
is finished. All right? Oh.

18
00:00:50,508 --> 00:00:52,092
Did you two draw
the short straw?

19
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:53,093
I'm sorry?

20
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:55,387
You're in charge of corralling
the cancer patients.

21
00:00:55,513 --> 00:00:57,056
It's not the most glamorous
duty in the world.

22
00:00:57,182 --> 00:00:58,265
Oh.

23
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:00,017
I suppose you two
don't mind working together.

24
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:01,477
How long have
you been dating?

25
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:03,270
Oh, no, I'm sort of seeing someone else.

26
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:04,938
Oh, it's going to
happen sooner or later.

27
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:07,816
- Uh, excuse me.
- Uh, excuse me a moment.

28
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:09,234
Yes. Hi.

29
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,653
Uh, I'm sorry. I think
I'm in the wrong place.

30
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,405
Are you here for the
Emerson Petroleum depositions?

31
00:01:13,531 --> 00:01:15,574
Oh, no, no.
I'm an old friend of Harvey Specter's.

32
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,159
This place is huge.
I always get turned around.

33
00:01:17,285 --> 00:01:18,160
- Yeah.
- Maybe you can point me

34
00:01:18,286 --> 00:01:19,661
- in the right direction?
- Uh, no problem.

35
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:21,080
You just see those doors right there?

36
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:23,332
Go through to the elevators
and up two floors.

37
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:25,918
And then, you're going to take a right
and down the hall, and you'll see Donna.

38
00:01:26,044 --> 00:01:28,045
- Donna. Great. Thanks.
- Mmm-hmm.

39
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:29,046
Travis Tanner.

40
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:30,297
Mike Ross.
Good to meet you.

41
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:31,465
A pleasure to
meet you, too, Mike.

42
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:33,008
Take care.

43
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:35,886
My wife, Emily,
and I, we...

44
00:01:36,012 --> 00:01:38,597
We saved every dollar
I made in the Army

45
00:01:38,723 --> 00:01:41,683
and we moved here from
Apple Creek, New York, six years ago.

46
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:43,519
We bought a brownstone,

47
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:45,270
and we planted
a tomato garden.

48
00:01:45,396 --> 00:01:46,855
We had barbecues
with the neighbors.

49
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:48,982
It was... It was
a dream come true.

50
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:52,528
After being diagnosed
with lung cancer,

51
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:54,154
I couldn't work anymore.

52
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,405
I mean, there's times
I have difficulty

53
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:57,699
even going up the stairs
to my daughter's room.

54
00:01:57,826 --> 00:02:00,911
You attended Apple Creek
High School. Is that right?

55
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:02,371
All four years.

56
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:04,957
Your high school
was built in 1985.

57
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:06,750
What was there before?

58
00:02:06,876 --> 00:02:08,794
An oil well.

59
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,296
Owned and operated
by Emerson Petroleum.

60
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:14,842
Now, Kenny, why was
the high school shut down?

61
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:18,220
Because 200 people who
taught at or attended Apple Creek High

62
00:02:18,346 --> 00:02:20,764
were diagnosed with
some form of cancer.

63
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:23,308
I'm so sorry to interrupt.

64
00:02:24,185 --> 00:02:25,477
That's for you, Larry.

65
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:27,354
Trust me. It's good. Use it.

66
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,315
- How do you know my name?
- It's all in there, Larry.

67
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:36,029
- Hey, are you Donna?
- Yeah. Can I help you?

68
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,364
Yeah. Mike Ross told me
to find you.

69
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,867
We were in the library and one of the
plaintiffs fainted, hit their head.

70
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:42,703
Oh, my gosh. Okay.
I'm on it. Thank you.

71
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:43,954
You're welcome.

72
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:52,087
Wrong office.

73
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:53,422
Harvey, I have to admit,

74
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:56,717
great job making Kenny Verdasco the face
of your class action suit.

75
00:02:57,969 --> 00:02:59,678
I don't know who
Kenny Verdasco is.

76
00:02:59,804 --> 00:03:01,180
Oh, well, you'd
better find out.

77
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:04,183
How about for starters you introduce
yourself, or I'm calling security?

78
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:06,059
- Donna?
- Relax. Relax.

79
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:07,853
Name's Travis Tanner.

80
00:03:10,064 --> 00:03:11,732
You're Travis Tanner?

81
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:13,567
You've heard of me.

82
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:14,902
No.

83
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:16,820
I'm a senior partner
with Clyde-MacPhee.

84
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:18,113
We're based in Boston.

85
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,365
So are the Red Sox. I don't give a shit
about them, either.

86
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:21,533
That's funny.

87
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:24,286
You know, what's not funny is what's
happening to Kenny Verdasco.

88
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:26,872
At this moment, they're asking
him about his parents,

89
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:29,791
both heavy smokers.
Nasty habit.

90
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:32,377
Yes. A pack a day each.

91
00:03:32,503 --> 00:03:33,712
I lived with them
until I was 18.

92
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:35,797
Then, they'll ask how,
in the army,

93
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:38,634
he was exposed to nickel, chromium,
and hydrocarbons.

94
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:41,511
I... I... I was
an infantry soldier.

95
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:43,305
I didn't have much choice
in the matter.

96
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:46,600
Not to mention
the frivolous lawsuit

97
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:49,228
he filed ten years ago against
the Shriver Grocery Chain.

98
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:51,438
It wasn't frivolous.

99
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:53,357
I slipped and shattered
my elbow.

100
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:56,026
If they're doing such
a great job down there,

101
00:03:56,152 --> 00:03:57,945
what are you doing up
here in my office?

102
00:03:58,071 --> 00:03:59,947
Because I gave them
all that.

103
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:01,782
And when they walk
out that door,

104
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:03,867
I'm going to be the one
who fires their asses.

105
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:06,370
So are you coming to
me for a pep talk?

106
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:07,746
You're going to
do great, kiddo.

107
00:04:07,872 --> 00:04:10,874
No, you see, Emerson Petroleum was
going to lose this case.

108
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,418
So they called me in
to fix the situation.

109
00:04:13,544 --> 00:04:15,545
And when I beat
Pearson Hardman,

110
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:18,382
I don't want anyone saying it was
because they didn't send in their best.

111
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:19,633
Well, I'm sorry to
disappoint you,

112
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,302
but Jessica Pearson's
handling this case herself.

113
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:23,804
And if you think that
she's not the best,

114
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,555
why don't you take a run
at her and find out?

115
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:26,974
All right, look.
I hear what you're saying.

116
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,725
But here's the thing.

117
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:31,061
I know that you
know who I am.

118
00:04:31,187 --> 00:04:34,064
And I also know that
during your senior year,

119
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:36,191
you missed out on playing
in the state championship

120
00:04:36,317 --> 00:04:37,901
because of your shoulder.

121
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:39,528
You can't pitch with
a bad shoulder.

122
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:40,946
And what do you know?

123
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:43,365
They won without you, Harvey.

124
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:46,326
Now, ask yourself something.

125
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:51,290
Are you going to let Jessica Pearson
play the big game for you? Hmm?

126
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:53,917
What's so funny?

127
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:57,296
I'm just thinking about
how I'm going to enjoy kicking your ass.

128
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:58,922
I'll see you in court.

129
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:05,929
See the money,
wanna stay for your meal

130
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:09,141
Get another piece of pie
for your wife

131
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:12,519
Everybody wanna know
how it feel

132
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:16,023
Everybody wanna see
what it's like

133
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:19,192
I'll even eat a bean pie
I don't mind

134
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,069
Me and missy is so early

135
00:05:21,195 --> 00:05:23,030
Busy, busy making money

136
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,448
All right!

137
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:28,869
All step back
I'm 'bout to dance

138
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:32,039
The greenback boogie

139
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:40,172
That was an attack
on my history,

140
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:42,257
my family, everything
I care about.

141
00:05:42,383 --> 00:05:43,759
I told you this was coming.

142
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:45,052
They're just trying
to rattle you.

143
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:46,595
Yeah, well, they're doing
a hell of a good job.

144
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:48,847
Kenny, you're
our lead plaintiff.

145
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:50,557
You've got to keep
your composure.

146
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:51,933
I don't care
about composure.

147
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,143
I want to make a settlement.

148
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:54,394
That's exactly what they want.

149
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,146
Kenny, I'd like you
to meet Harvey Specter.

150
00:05:56,272 --> 00:05:57,314
He's my right hand.

151
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,816
Can your right hand please tell me why
we shouldn't ask for a settlement?

152
00:05:59,942 --> 00:06:01,318
I'm not against
settling one bit.

153
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:02,944
But if we go to them,
we're weak.

154
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:04,363
If they come to us,
we're strong.

155
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:07,032
Harvey's right. They came after you
because they're running scared.

156
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:09,368
Trust me. They'll come
to us soon enough.

157
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:12,079
Okay.

158
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:13,747
One more thing.

159
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:15,624
I'm going to postpone
the rest of the depositions.

160
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:18,168
Don't tell the rest of
the plaintiffs what happened.

161
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:23,757
What the hell was that?

162
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:25,926
I need you to let me
take over this case.

163
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:27,886
The guy that came
into my deposition.

164
00:06:28,012 --> 00:06:29,596
- He called you out?
- Yeah.

165
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:31,056
- He's good.
- Yeah.

166
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:32,849
You think I can't take him?

167
00:06:32,975 --> 00:06:33,934
He brought up
the state championships.

168
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,894
Oh. Shoulder.

169
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:37,396
- Yeah.
- Ooh.

170
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:39,272
Take him.

171
00:06:39,857 --> 00:06:41,483
- Be careful.
- I will.

172
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:43,235
I mean, bringing up
the state championships...

173
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:45,320
That's just... That's wrong.

174
00:06:45,446 --> 00:06:47,197
Nothing I wouldn't have done.

175
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,663
Here you go.

176
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:56,581
I need you to dig
into Travis Tanner.

177
00:06:56,707 --> 00:06:58,417
Find out where he's worked.
Where he's gone to school.

178
00:06:58,543 --> 00:06:59,668
What cases he's won.

179
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:01,920
Why? You thinking about
starting a Wikipedia page for him?

180
00:07:02,046 --> 00:07:04,548
I don't know anything about
how this guy operates.

181
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:05,757
And before I make a move,

182
00:07:05,883 --> 00:07:08,260
I need to know everything
about how this guy operates.

183
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:10,303
Right. For his
Wikipedia page.

184
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,930
You think the Mavericks
didn't watch game film

185
00:07:12,056 --> 00:07:13,223
on LeBron before
they played the Heat?

186
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:15,350
You're Harvey Specter.
You don't need to watch game film.

187
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:18,019
Do you know who's watched
more game film than anybody?

188
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:19,980
- No. Who?
- Michael Jordan.

189
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:21,731
What? How do
you know that?

190
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:23,692
You don't believe me?
Let's call him.

191
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:28,238
You have Michael Jordan's
phone number.

192
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:29,573
Yep.

193
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:32,909
If I hit this button right here,
I call Michael Jordan?

194
00:07:33,035 --> 00:07:35,162
That's kind of how
a phone works.

195
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,164
Speed dial 23.

196
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,415
I'm doing it.

197
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:40,625
- Go for it.
- I'm going to ask him about baseball.

198
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:42,335
Do not ask him
about baseball.

199
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,296
Ah! Wrong...
Wrong number.

200
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:46,590
You're kidding me.

201
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:48,008
Oh, my God.

202
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:49,217
Who are you?

203
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:53,388
Everybody, stop
what you're doing.

204
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:56,141
Stand up and follow me
in the library.

205
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:58,268
Mike, that goes for you, too.
Up and at them.

206
00:07:58,394 --> 00:08:00,061
Uh, yeah, Louis,
I'd love to,

207
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:01,188
but I have some work
to do for Harvey.

208
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:03,523
His Majesty can wait.
All associates in the library now.

209
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:05,192
Let's go.

210
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:06,318
Oh.

211
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:08,111
Let's go.

212
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:10,906
Rumor is we're getting
our annual raises early.

213
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:12,449
People are freaking out.

214
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:13,992
That's great, Harold.

215
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:16,203
I'm thinking about
getting a tattoo.

216
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:17,954
You need a raise
for that?

217
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,581
I'm really over-paying
for my apartment.

218
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:21,625
Good morning, everyone.

219
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:25,128
Many of you seem to think
this is about getting your raises early.

220
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:26,713
- It isn't.
- Suck.

221
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:29,007
We've discovered
a breach at the firm.

222
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:31,176
A confidential witness
list was leaked

223
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:33,053
to a rival firm.

224
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,804
Wakefield-Cady.

225
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:38,183
Now, it's entirely possible
that this was an honest mistake.

226
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:41,478
If so, we urge the
responsible party to come forward.

227
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:44,189
If not, we'll find out
soon enough.

228
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:47,734
Either way, we will
get to the bottom of this.

229
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:50,237
Louis.

230
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:59,204
Jessica seems to think
a mistake has been made.

231
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:02,290
I don't believe so.

232
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:05,418
I also don't believe
this is a matter of ethics.

233
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,254
It's a matter of loyalty.

234
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:10,715
Someone in this room
has betrayed us all,

235
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:12,676
and it makes me sick.

236
00:09:14,303 --> 00:09:16,680
And the fact that it went to those
holier-than-thou pricks

237
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:17,806
at Wakefield-Cady...

238
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:20,225
You know what?
That makes me sicker.

239
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:22,852
Now, you all work together,

240
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:24,896
in the trenches,
shoulder to shoulder.

241
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:28,400
Which means one of you
must know who did this.

242
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:29,859
Now, if y'all harbor knowledge

243
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:32,612
of the perpetrator and do not turn him
in,

244
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:34,239
you are as bad as
the perpetrator himself.

245
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:36,366
You along with the
perpetrator will be fired.

246
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:38,410
He's doing George W. Bush.

247
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:39,953
You're either with us
or against us, folks.

248
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:41,997
He sounds like Bush,
but he looks just like Cheney.

249
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:47,752
You got something
to tell me, Harold?

250
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:48,837
Mmm-mmm.

251
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:50,589
No? Not that
dermatological problem

252
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:52,382
that you were talking
to me about earlier in my office?

253
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:54,134
- No? Not that one?
- No.

254
00:09:55,636 --> 00:09:58,555
To show you how serious I am,
I have an incentive.

255
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:01,141
Whoever turns
this traitor in

256
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:05,103
receives $10,000.

257
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:06,479
You're welcome.

258
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:09,816
Feel free to
go back to work.

259
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:13,153
$10,000.
That's a big tattoo.

260
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,030
Yeah, it would be huge.

261
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:17,991
Why?

262
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:19,784
Louis. There was
a witness list...

263
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:22,203
I don't care. Tell me what
you learned about Travis Tanner.

264
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:23,830
It's all in there.

265
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:26,207
Travis Tanner went to Yale,
undergrad and law.

266
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:27,334
Honors in both.

267
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,336
He was a junior
tennis champion.

268
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:30,795
Tennis. Just like Louis.

269
00:10:30,921 --> 00:10:32,339
Yeah. He played in
college, too.

270
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:33,632
Oh, my God.

271
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:36,760
More importantly, he was the youngest
senior partner at Clyde-MacPhee.

272
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:39,137
This guy's record
is off the charts.

273
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:40,138
Really?

274
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:42,307
He specializes in breaking
class action lawsuits.

275
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:44,351
Harris Tobacco,
Bell Pesticide,

276
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:47,520
GravTech Securities,
he broke them all.

277
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:48,730
How come
I've never heard of him?

278
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:51,274
Evidently, he doesn't like
to take public credit.

279
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,068
Stays off the radar.

280
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:54,319
He avoids the press.
I mean,

281
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:56,738
I only found this stuff
by looking through court records.

282
00:10:56,864 --> 00:10:58,490
Now, it makes sense.

283
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:00,992
- What?
- Why he thinks I know him.

284
00:11:01,118 --> 00:11:02,786
I know those other attorneys.

285
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:04,496
He thinks they've told
me about him.

286
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:05,747
- They never did?
- No.

287
00:11:05,873 --> 00:11:07,457
- Why not?
- Because he beat them.

288
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:10,001
This guy's kind of a badass.

289
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:11,711
You want me to get
you an autograph?

290
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:14,047
No. I'm just respecting
our foe.

291
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:15,298
Foe?

292
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:17,342
It's from The Art of War.
No?

293
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:20,679
No. Look, I need to know how those other
cases are different from ours.

294
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:23,807
Well, those other cases
were spread out

295
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:25,975
geographically,
economically, socially.

296
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:28,228
Ours is in a single town.
A single school.

297
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:30,105
A single cluster
of plaintiffs.

298
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:32,023
Okay. That's good.

299
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:35,193
That tennis playing douche-bag, Travis
Tanner, is on the phone.

300
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:37,737
You know I listen.

301
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:44,202
Travis, what can I
do for you?

302
00:11:44,328 --> 00:11:47,831
Yeah, I'm happy to discuss the case.
On one condition.

303
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:50,625
You're going to meet me
at Apple Creek High School.

304
00:11:50,751 --> 00:11:52,210
See you in an hour.

305
00:11:52,336 --> 00:11:53,586
Why do you want
to meet there?

306
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:55,213
Because that's ground zero.

307
00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:58,633
And I want the emotion of that school
under my feet when I negotiate.

308
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:00,301
I thought you were
against emotions.

309
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:03,221
I'm against having emotions.
I'm not against using them.

310
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:05,682
Come on.
I thought we were homies.

311
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:07,809
Jimmy, I didn't
leak anything.

312
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:09,644
You know, I remember
you said you hated Louis Litt

313
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:12,021
and you were second-guessing
your decision to become a lawyer.

314
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:14,441
I told you that in confidence over
six Cosmopolitans.

315
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:16,359
That doesn't mean
you're not the guy.

316
00:12:16,485 --> 00:12:18,820
Harold, really?
You drink Cosmopolitans?

317
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:21,865
Stop doing that. Unless you're with
girls, which you never are.

318
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:23,908
And Jimmy, are you kidding me?
Going after Harold?

319
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:25,160
What? How do you know
he didn't do it?

320
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:26,411
How do we know
you didn't do it?

321
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:27,412
Maybe you're the guy.

322
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:29,706
Oh, my God.
Guys, this is ridiculous.

323
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:33,251
All right, has it occurred to any of you
that maybe this is all just a big test?

324
00:12:33,377 --> 00:12:36,755
Wow. Wow. Spoken like a person
with something to hide.

325
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:38,423
Louis was talking
about loyalty.

326
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:39,632
Maybe this is just some test

327
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:42,093
to see how loyal we are by not turning
on each other.

328
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:44,512
Are you kidding? Jessica would never
play along with something like that.

329
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:45,847
Even if it's not a test,

330
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:47,640
this is a law office,
not Lord of the Flies.

331
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,225
Everybody, get back to work.

332
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:55,064
Are these
the Galusska briefs?

333
00:12:58,235 --> 00:12:59,903
You guys, Louis has been
hounding us for these.

334
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:02,155
Why hasn't anyone
taken them to him?

335
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:06,493
Are you serious? Wow.
You're scared of him.

336
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:10,580
It's Louis Litt.
It's not Darth Vader.

337
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:14,209
This is what courage looks
like, Jimmy. Pay attention.

338
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:15,210
Please.

339
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:18,880
Louis. The Galusska briefs.

340
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:20,173
Sorry they're late.

341
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:22,091
Thank you, Mr. Mike Ross.

342
00:13:38,734 --> 00:13:40,068
You sure
you're ready for this?

343
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:41,486
I'm here, aren't I?

344
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:43,446
I've been looking into you.
You're an elusive man.

345
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:44,906
Yeah, well,
when you're number one,

346
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:47,242
you don't need to broadcast your
victories, Harvey.

347
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:48,868
That's funny.
Where I come from,

348
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:51,746
number one doesn't usually challenge
number two to a fight.

349
00:13:52,706 --> 00:13:54,916
This school was
Apple Creek's pride.

350
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:57,168
Parents felt safe
sending their children here

351
00:13:57,294 --> 00:13:59,087
and teachers felt safe
teaching here.

352
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:01,589
You know what Apple Creek
High School is now?

353
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:03,007
A bunch of trailers
on the outskirts of town.

354
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:06,469
All because 30 years ago, your clients
failed to cap an oil well

355
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:07,804
and gave them all cancer.

356
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:11,391
You see all these power lines around
here? They criss-cross the entire town.

357
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:14,561
Two miles down
that road, paint factory.

358
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:15,770
You've got a microwave tower.

359
00:14:15,896 --> 00:14:17,397
And all this grass
that you see?

360
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:20,942
It's been treated with pesticide
every week for twenty years.

361
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:23,945
You say it's our fault.
I say you're wrong.

362
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:26,281
That office.
Mitch Rosewall.

363
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:28,491
Soccer coach.
Brain cancer.

364
00:14:28,617 --> 00:14:32,161
Library. Monica Dodd volunteered.
She ran it for years.

365
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:33,830
Stomach cancer.

366
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:35,164
They both died last month,

367
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,000
and they sure as hell
didn't die from pesticide.

368
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:38,001
Can you prove it?

369
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:41,296
If we go to trial, it won't be about
proving anything.

370
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:44,966
It will be about Monica,
Mitch, and Kenny.

371
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:47,010
And you won't
stand a chance.

372
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:50,513
Oh, this is fun, Harvey.

373
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:55,184
I'm just sorry to say that we won't get
to do this in court.

374
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:57,979
Against my advice,
Emerson wants to settle.

375
00:14:58,105 --> 00:14:58,980
You're kidding me.

376
00:14:59,106 --> 00:15:00,940
After all this,
you want to settle.

377
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:02,066
No, I don't.

378
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:03,818
But those are
my instructions.

379
00:15:03,944 --> 00:15:04,986
Call it a draw.

380
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:19,542
Mike, get over to
Kenny's house.

381
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:21,753
Tanner's going to try
and make him cave.

382
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,557
Hey, I came as soon
as I got the message.

383
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:38,519
Kenny?
It's Harvey Specter.

384
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:42,398
Was Travis Tanner here?
I was just with him.

385
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:44,108
He couldn't have
beaten me by much.

386
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:45,944
Sweetie, why don't you
go inside? Okay, baby.

387
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:47,028
Okay.

388
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:51,240
No, it wasn't him. It was someone else.
He wouldn't tell me his name.

389
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:52,909
He said he was with Pearson Hardman,
so I let him in.

390
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:54,494
Did he mention
Tanner's name?

391
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:56,621
No, but it was obvious
that's who he worked for.

392
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:57,997
He said me and the other plaintiffs

393
00:15:58,123 --> 00:15:59,165
would be getting a settlement offer
soon.

394
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:01,042
- What else?
- He said if we don't take it,

395
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:02,710
that they're going
to go after us.

396
00:16:02,836 --> 00:16:04,087
That they have dirt
on everyone.

397
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:06,547
He mentioned Eva Williams'
arrest for public intoxication.

398
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:08,883
Bernie Rutherford's shoplifting arrest
when he was in college.

399
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:10,468
That's criminal intimidation.

400
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:12,887
If they want to go after me, that's
fine. I can handle it.

401
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:14,597
But the others?

402
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:15,974
I don't know if they can.

403
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,350
You have to
stay strong, Kenny.

404
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:19,435
You cave,
everything falls apart.

405
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:21,562
One more thing.
What did this guy look like?

406
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:24,774
I don't know. He was average height.
Brown hair. Brown eyes.

407
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:25,900
Thanks.

408
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:29,362
You want me to start
figuring out who this guy is?

409
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:31,698
No. We'll never find him.

410
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:43,584
How did you know
Tanner was going after Kenny?

411
00:16:43,877 --> 00:16:45,586
Because if I was the
type to go out of bounds,

412
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:46,754
that's exactly what I'd do.

413
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,214
- You're not?
- No.

414
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,465
Huh.

415
00:16:49,883 --> 00:16:50,758
So what's our next move?

416
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:51,968
I'm calling in
reinforcements.

417
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:53,052
What do you mean?

418
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:55,847
If Tanner sent a guy
to intimidate Kenny,

419
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:58,307
he's got something else up his sleeve
and I want to know what it is.

420
00:16:58,434 --> 00:16:59,767
Oh, man.

421
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:00,977
What?

422
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:03,980
Nothing. It's... You guys are like two
sides of the same coin.

423
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:05,231
What are you saying?

424
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:06,441
He's another me?

425
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:08,401
No one is another me.

426
00:17:08,652 --> 00:17:10,403
You told Donna
I was another you.

427
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:11,779
I never said that.

428
00:17:11,905 --> 00:17:14,198
You said you were
looking for another you,

429
00:17:14,324 --> 00:17:15,700
and then you hired me.

430
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:16,784
So...

431
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:18,703
See how that works?

432
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:21,164
Logic?

433
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,212
Mike. Let's go.
In my office. Now.

434
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:32,800
Oh. Damn, Mike,

435
00:17:32,926 --> 00:17:35,136
tell me you didn't leak
the documents, man.

436
00:17:35,262 --> 00:17:36,387
Are you our
Benedict Arnold?

437
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:38,306
Benedict Arnold.
Nice reference.

438
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:40,308
You helping your high school
girlfriend with her homework again?

439
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:41,976
Okay, not cool, Mike.

440
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:44,187
You know Darla's in
community college.

441
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:48,900
I don't even know why you're laughing,
Harold. You don't have a chick.

442
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:51,027
She's of age.

443
00:17:54,531 --> 00:17:55,698
So, you...

444
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:57,992
I am so very proud
of you, Mike.

445
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:00,620
Wow, I really wish
you weren't touching me right now.

446
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:03,206
You are what
loyalty looks like.

447
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:05,208
You rooted out
the person responsible for

448
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:07,126
leaking the witness list
to Wakefield-Cady.

449
00:18:08,378 --> 00:18:09,879
Louis, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

450
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:13,049
It was almost cute how you hid the
evidence in the Galusska Briefs.

451
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:14,133
Like you didn't want
to take the credit.

452
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:16,010
What? Louis, I didn't
hide anything in...

453
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:18,513
Don't worry. No one's
going to label you a snitch.

454
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:19,889
Snitch.

455
00:18:20,015 --> 00:18:22,058
We didn't even think
to check the fax machines.

456
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:23,768
That was brilliant.

457
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:26,979
The list was sent from
right here in this firm.

458
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:31,150
This is a copy of a fax submission
form sent from three days ago.

459
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:32,360
This doesn't
implicate anybody.

460
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:34,445
That's the confidential
employee code.

461
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:37,156
She must not have known that the
machine recorded it.

462
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:38,157
She?

463
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:39,367
Wait. Why am
I being suspended?

464
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:43,204
I didn't leak any documents.
Who told Louis I did this?

465
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:45,915
- Let's go, please. This way, miss.
- Get your arms...

466
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:48,167
No, no, no. Louis,
you have to stop this.

467
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:49,502
I didn't turn Rachel in.

468
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:52,463
Oh, that's so sweet, how you didn't
really mean to hand someone in.

469
00:18:52,589 --> 00:18:55,591
Wait. Mike, stop.
You did a great thing.

470
00:18:55,717 --> 00:18:57,426
And because of
that great thing,

471
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,348
$10,000.
And don't spend it in one place.

472
00:19:06,353 --> 00:19:09,564
You say, "Thank you, Louis," and then,
"You're welcome, Mike."

473
00:19:09,773 --> 00:19:10,648
Rachel.

474
00:19:10,774 --> 00:19:12,316
- I don't want to talk to you.
- Hey, come on.

475
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:14,193
You want come on?
Why would you do that to me?

476
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:16,320
- I didn't do anything to you.
- I didn't fax that goddamn list.

477
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:17,655
And I didn't turn you in.

478
00:19:17,781 --> 00:19:19,157
Then why was I
just suspended, Mike?

479
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:21,117
All I know is that I gave
Louis a stack of briefs

480
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:23,494
and there was some fax
with your confidential code on it.

481
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:25,288
Do you think that if I was
going to leak firm documents,

482
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:27,582
I'd be dumb enough to
fax them with my own code?

483
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:30,334
No, I don't. But
whoever did this must have framed you.

484
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,752
Yeah, well, it worked.

485
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:34,255
Rachel, look, you just... They're going
to investigate this.

486
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:35,756
They're going to
clear your name. You know that.

487
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:38,009
I have worked there
for five years,

488
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:39,927
and this is how
they treat me?

489
00:19:40,053 --> 00:19:41,345
I'm suspended, Mike.

490
00:19:41,471 --> 00:19:43,222
I'm probably
going to be fired.

491
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:44,348
I should sue them.

492
00:19:44,474 --> 00:19:45,558
Okay, let's not do
anything rash, okay?

493
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:48,227
It's not rash.
It's standing up for myself.

494
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:51,230
Rachel, you're over...

495
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:05,620
Excuse me.

496
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:08,164
You wouldn't happen
to know what sort of wine

497
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:09,916
pairs well with a
duck l'orange, would you?

498
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:11,792
Mmm, try something with
a full-fruit flavor,

499
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,502
like a Cabernet Sauvignon.

500
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:16,839
Uh, Sauvignons are
a little bit oaky for my palate.

501
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:22,261
This article right here is
all about the resurgence of Pinot Noir.

502
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:31,437
You know, you could just pay me right
out in public.

503
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:32,897
But then I wouldn't feel
like James Bond.

504
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:34,815
Oh. Who does that make me?

505
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:36,484
Pussy Galore.

506
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:38,736
- Octopussy.
- Ah, that's enough, Harvey.

507
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:42,073
- What do you have for me?
- Nothing.

508
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:43,824
On paper, Tanner's clean.

509
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:46,827
He may break the rules,
but he covers his tracks.

510
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:48,871
You've never come up
empty for me before.

511
00:20:48,997 --> 00:20:50,915
I didn't this time, either.

512
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:54,418
Tanner booked a conference room
at the Waldorf tomorrow at noon.

513
00:20:54,544 --> 00:20:56,420
Divide and conquer.

514
00:20:56,546 --> 00:20:59,423
He's going to gather
my plaintiffs, scare them,

515
00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:01,342
and then give them
a low-ball offer.

516
00:21:02,302 --> 00:21:03,844
And that's illegal.

517
00:21:05,013 --> 00:21:06,347
What?

518
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:09,183
You've used me
for a lot of things.

519
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:12,311
You've never asked me to
investigate another attorney before.

520
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:13,521
This guy's good.

521
00:21:14,314 --> 00:21:16,941
If he called your plaintiffs, I can get
his phone records and prove it.

522
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:19,277
He didn't make
those calls himself.

523
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:21,779
He's not going to be at the Waldorf
either tomorrow.

524
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:24,907
But I will.

525
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:36,419
Donna. Can you tell me about these
confidential employee codes

526
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:39,505
that Louis says Rachel used to fax the
witness list over to Wakefield-Cady?

527
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:41,590
I have a thousand things
to do before lunch.

528
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,510
Hold Mike's hand while he crosses
the street, not one of them.

529
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:46,053
Donna, this one's
for Rachel.

530
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:47,179
What do you need?

531
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:48,889
I know we use the billing codes to
charge the clients.

532
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:50,349
But what do we use
the employee codes for?

533
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:52,977
They're special codes for when you need
to use the firm's resources

534
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:54,645
- for personal reasons.
- We can do that?

535
00:21:54,771 --> 00:21:57,440
- You can't. But Rachel can.
- Why?

536
00:21:57,566 --> 00:21:58,649
Because a fifth-year paralegal

537
00:21:58,775 --> 00:22:00,776
is more valuable to the firm
than a first-year associate.

538
00:22:00,902 --> 00:22:03,321
Okay. So, do you
have a personal code?

539
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:04,572
I have two.

540
00:22:04,698 --> 00:22:06,032
So where
do you get them?

541
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:07,950
They're generated by
the IT department.

542
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:09,535
We have an
IT department?

543
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:11,579
Well, the computers
don't run themselves.

544
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:13,706
At least until
Skynet goes active.

545
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:16,959
Sarah Connor.

546
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:19,795
- No.
- No.

547
00:22:19,921 --> 00:22:22,214
- That's... I'll work on that.
- Really bad.

548
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:30,806
What?

549
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:41,317
Uh, hi. Excuse me.
I'm looking for Benjamin?

550
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:43,778
- You found him.
- Oh, great. I'm Mike Ross.

551
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:45,154
We just spoke on the phone.

552
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,656
Man, this place is like
Battlestar Galactica.

553
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:49,909
Where do you guys
keep the Cylons?

554
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:53,496
Pearson Hardman takes care of us because
we're on call twenty-four seven.

555
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:56,832
If a server goes down or
a partner's computer crashes,

556
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:57,917
people die.

557
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:01,337
That's a little dramatic,
don't you think, Ben?

558
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:04,090
It's Benjamin. I'm sure you don't like
it when people call you Mike.

559
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:05,466
Actually, I prefer Mike.

560
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:07,385
Well, Mike,

561
00:23:07,677 --> 00:23:09,678
six months ago,
I was at Connolly White.

562
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:10,971
The network went haywire.

563
00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:14,725
We were in a breach-of-contract
litigation worth $400 million.

564
00:23:14,851 --> 00:23:16,310
They needed it fixed
in an hour.

565
00:23:16,436 --> 00:23:17,770
No one thought
it could be done.

566
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:20,481
I had the network up and running again
in 23 minutes.

567
00:23:20,607 --> 00:23:21,816
Is that dramatic
enough for you?

568
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:24,568
Wow. You're, like,
a regular Zuckerberg.

569
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:26,070
Zuckerberg?

570
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:29,657
Zuckerberg couldn't code
his way out of a paper bag.

571
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:31,784
You called about
the employee codes.

572
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:34,787
You're a first year.
You can't have one. Sorry.

573
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:36,497
Okay. Well,
I don't need one.

574
00:23:36,623 --> 00:23:38,207
I just want to know
if it's possible

575
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:41,168
for someone to gain
access to somebody else's code.

576
00:23:41,294 --> 00:23:42,753
Sure. For one person. Me.

577
00:23:42,879 --> 00:23:44,713
I have access to
all of the codes.

578
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:47,716
Okay. So, in your
short tenure here,

579
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:51,011
has anyone ever asked you for access to
someone else's code?

580
00:23:53,014 --> 00:23:54,473
Once. Last week.

581
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:56,517
- Who?
- I can't tell you that.

582
00:23:56,643 --> 00:23:59,520
- Why not?
- IT officer client privilege.

583
00:23:59,646 --> 00:24:01,689
Does that even exist, Ben?

584
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:03,482
It does in here.

585
00:24:05,652 --> 00:24:07,486
All right, Ben.

586
00:24:08,321 --> 00:24:11,657
Why don't we... make a bet?

587
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,743
I think you mean
a wager. Michael.

588
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:16,036
Yeah. Sure.

589
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:18,747
I'm going to tell you every single
number on this piece of paper,

590
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:20,958
and you're going to
give me that name.

591
00:24:21,835 --> 00:24:23,210
And if you can't?

592
00:24:23,336 --> 00:24:24,503
Then, I'm going to
give you this check.

593
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:26,088
For ten grand.

594
00:24:28,508 --> 00:24:31,635
You get one number, one comma,
one decimal point wrong,

595
00:24:31,761 --> 00:24:32,761
and that money is mine.

596
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:37,766
Oh, and when I win, I'll also take one
of those computers.

597
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:41,020
And for the record, there's not a single
comma on there.

598
00:24:43,565 --> 00:24:44,690
You ready?

599
00:24:49,863 --> 00:24:51,280
Rachel, it's Mike.

600
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:54,992
I figured out who leaked
the list to Wakefield-Cady.

601
00:24:55,118 --> 00:24:57,328
It was Louis.
Call me back.

602
00:25:11,718 --> 00:25:14,512
Hi. I'm Rachel Zane. I'm here for
my job interview.

603
00:25:14,638 --> 00:25:16,889
- Welcome to Wakefield-Cady.
- Thank you.

604
00:25:21,978 --> 00:25:23,646
Okay. As soon as
we get inside,

605
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:25,856
I need you to find every plaintiff
you interviewed

606
00:25:25,982 --> 00:25:28,108
and tell them they're here
under false pretenses.

607
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:29,818
- Done.
- Kenny's meeting us here.

608
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:32,446
We need him to identify
the man who came to see him,

609
00:25:32,572 --> 00:25:35,115
and we're going to wait for that guy to
approach any of our plaintiffs.

610
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:36,659
And if we connect
that guy to Tanner,

611
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:38,661
then we have him
on criminal intimidation.

612
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:40,996
And Emerson Petroleum
will have no choice but to settle.

613
00:25:41,122 --> 00:25:42,915
Hey, Kenny. Good to see you.

614
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:44,959
This is going to be fun.

615
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:49,171
You were right.

616
00:25:49,297 --> 00:25:51,131
He called
every one of them.

617
00:25:51,591 --> 00:25:52,925
You see the guy?

618
00:25:53,927 --> 00:25:55,010
No.

619
00:25:55,136 --> 00:25:56,804
Start looking.

620
00:25:57,556 --> 00:25:58,847
Hey, wait a minute.

621
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:00,224
Mrs. Williams.

622
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:02,393
Do you remember me? I'm Mike Ross.
From the office?

623
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:03,394
I remember you.

624
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,604
Do you mind if I ask you
what you're doing here today?

625
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:08,983
We were invited to come
and hear a settlement offer.

626
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:10,359
Really?

627
00:26:11,027 --> 00:26:12,486
Uh, excuse me.

628
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:16,949
He came here himself.

629
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:18,534
Well, big mistake.

630
00:26:19,452 --> 00:26:21,245
Sorry to ruin
your little brunch.

631
00:26:21,371 --> 00:26:23,414
But I think
you know damn well

632
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:25,749
that you can't legally
address my clients.

633
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:27,960
Hey, I just came
for the juice.

634
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:31,380
Mmm. Pulp free.

635
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:34,633
I know I can't talk to
your clients directly.

636
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:36,719
But thank God
you're here, Harv.

637
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:39,847
Because what I can do
is I can talk to you.

638
00:26:41,474 --> 00:26:42,516
Harvey,

639
00:26:42,642 --> 00:26:46,061
Emerson Petroleum is
offering $25,000

640
00:26:46,187 --> 00:26:48,147
to each and every
one of your clients!

641
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:51,317
If they don't take that,
this trial stretches out for years.

642
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:53,694
Cross-examinations
will be brutal.

643
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,738
They take our settlement,

644
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:58,407
and this whole thing
will be gone tomorrow.

645
00:26:59,492 --> 00:27:03,662
Now, if any of your clients want to get
in touch with me,

646
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:06,373
here's my number.

647
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:12,463
Mr. Ross.

648
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:14,548
Harvey.

649
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:17,635
Erase that number.

650
00:27:18,845 --> 00:27:21,847
You're not going to get away with what
you're doing. You know that, right?

651
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:23,265
What?

652
00:27:23,391 --> 00:27:24,642
I just addressed you
with a raised voice.

653
00:27:24,768 --> 00:27:26,602
Sometimes,
my ears aren't so good.

654
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:29,063
If other people heard me,
I apologize, Harvey.

655
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:31,690
I'm just glad you were smart enough to
figure out I booked the Waldorf,

656
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:37,696
Mmm. I think I
need to take this.

657
00:27:37,822 --> 00:27:39,406
I'm guessing it's
one of your clients

658
00:27:39,532 --> 00:27:41,742
wanting to take
my settlement offer.

659
00:27:41,951 --> 00:27:43,202
Hello.

660
00:27:43,453 --> 00:27:44,620
Tanner.

661
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:46,497
I'm coming after you.

662
00:27:47,624 --> 00:27:49,416
Oh, I got your number.

663
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:06,183
The plaintiffs are scared.

664
00:28:06,309 --> 00:28:08,936
They're talking about
accepting Tanner's low-ball offer.

665
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:12,481
Those floodgates open,
and we're done.

666
00:28:12,607 --> 00:28:14,066
That's why I went to
go see Clarkson.

667
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:15,442
The legal finance guys.

668
00:28:15,568 --> 00:28:18,195
If we can get our plaintiffs a loan
against a future jury award,

669
00:28:18,321 --> 00:28:20,322
it will close the floodgates
and buy us more time.

670
00:28:20,448 --> 00:28:22,449
Well, those loans
aren't cheap, Harvey.

671
00:28:22,575 --> 00:28:25,452
Well, it's better than
settling for pennies on the dollar.

672
00:28:26,621 --> 00:28:27,496
Then do it.

673
00:28:27,622 --> 00:28:29,790
I tried, but they won't give us anything
without collateral.

674
00:28:31,084 --> 00:28:32,543
They don't think you can win.

675
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:34,211
They're wrong.

676
00:28:34,337 --> 00:28:36,171
Well, that's what
I like to hear.

677
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:38,966
I need a million dollars
to get that loan.

678
00:28:39,092 --> 00:28:40,551
You're talking about
firm money?

679
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:42,720
- Yeah.
- Yeah, no way that happens.

680
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:45,055
- You don't think I'm a good bet?
- That has nothing to do with it.

681
00:28:45,181 --> 00:28:46,181
This was your case.

682
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:47,683
And I gave it to you to win.

683
00:28:47,809 --> 00:28:50,227
Which I will do, if you just show
some faith in me.

684
00:28:50,353 --> 00:28:53,439
You can have my faith,
but you're not getting my money.

685
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:06,744
What are you doing here?

686
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:08,704
I left you three messages.

687
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:10,664
Louis framed you.
We can take him down.

688
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:11,790
I don't want to
take him down, Mike.

689
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:12,958
Why not?

690
00:29:13,084 --> 00:29:14,877
Because I want a fresh start.

691
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:17,254
So, you don't want to work
at Pearson Hardman anymore?

692
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:18,881
I applied for a job
at Wakefield-Cady.

693
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:20,215
They offered it to me
in the room.

694
00:29:20,341 --> 00:29:21,341
I start Monday.

695
00:29:21,468 --> 00:29:24,344
You took a job at the company
that ended up with the leaked list?

696
00:29:24,471 --> 00:29:25,471
Do you know what
that looks like?

697
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:26,638
I don't care
what it looks like.

698
00:29:26,973 --> 00:29:28,807
I'm not guilty
and I need a job.

699
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:30,684
So the going gets rough
and you just quit.

700
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:33,312
No. I'm not quitting.
I was fired, remember?

701
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:34,605
No, you were suspended.

702
00:29:34,731 --> 00:29:35,773
And you can still
save your job.

703
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:37,441
Well, if Louis wants
me gone, I'm gone.

704
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:39,818
Rachel, Louis tried to frame me once
and I fought back.

705
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:41,403
Why aren't you doing
the same thing?

706
00:29:41,529 --> 00:29:42,696
Because except for you,

707
00:29:42,822 --> 00:29:45,783
no one from Pearson Hardman
has contacted me at all.

708
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:47,576
Why would I fight
to stay there?

709
00:29:47,702 --> 00:29:50,120
They're accusing me
of spilling secrets?

710
00:29:50,246 --> 00:29:52,039
I'll show them
spilling secrets.

711
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:54,333
I'll tell Wakefield-Cady
everything.

712
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:56,418
I may not have
a photographic memory, Mike,

713
00:29:56,544 --> 00:29:58,212
but I sure as hell
know a lot.

714
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:01,131
Rachel.

715
00:30:09,098 --> 00:30:10,140
Moneypenny.

716
00:30:10,266 --> 00:30:11,809
- Don't call me that.
- Why not?

717
00:30:12,393 --> 00:30:14,812
Because she had a thing for him.
This is the other way around.

718
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:16,730
What, you don't like me?

719
00:30:16,856 --> 00:30:18,690
I like you enough
to give you this.

720
00:30:19,025 --> 00:30:20,108
What's that?

721
00:30:20,944 --> 00:30:22,736
I tapped the phones
at Emerson Petroleum.

722
00:30:22,862 --> 00:30:25,239
This is a conference call
between Travis Tanner

723
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:27,324
and several high-ranking
Emerson executives.

724
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:29,034
I hope they're talking about
more than just the weather.

725
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,994
They're talking about
Tanner intimidating your client.

726
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,704
Both you and I know that
without a warrant,

727
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:34,623
this recording is
not admissible in court.

728
00:30:34,749 --> 00:30:38,168
It is if you testify that
you don't know where it came from.

729
00:30:38,878 --> 00:30:40,671
Why did you do this?

730
00:30:42,423 --> 00:30:43,715
Because you need it.

731
00:30:45,593 --> 00:30:48,554
I'm not going to commit
perjury to win a case.

732
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:57,646
Oh, weird. Look what I found.

733
00:30:58,439 --> 00:31:01,859
Oh. You are a prince
among men.

734
00:31:02,318 --> 00:31:03,986
I don't understand
why you use skim milk

735
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:06,697
and then put whip cream
and sugar in it.

736
00:31:07,448 --> 00:31:09,449
Because I use skim milk,

737
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:11,577
I can put whip cream
and sugar in it.

738
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:12,786
Ah.

739
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:16,206
What's wrong?

740
00:31:16,332 --> 00:31:17,875
- Can we talk for a second?
- Yeah.

741
00:31:19,627 --> 00:31:23,297
Last week, Louis got Rachel's
confidential code

742
00:31:23,423 --> 00:31:24,464
from
the IT department.

743
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:26,800
And?

744
00:31:26,926 --> 00:31:29,011
And it's a smoking gun.

745
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:30,596
He's the one that set her up.

746
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:32,431
Why would Louis
betray the firm?

747
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:35,017
Uh, I don't know. Maybe he's still upset
that he got passed over

748
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:36,018
for senior partner

749
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:37,728
and leaked the list
before he jumps ship.

750
00:31:37,854 --> 00:31:40,022
Mike, Louis is
a lot of things.

751
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:41,481
But he's not a traitor.

752
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:42,858
That man bleeds
Pearson Hardman.

753
00:31:42,984 --> 00:31:44,735
He's probably wearing Pearson Hardman
underwear right now.

754
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:46,904
Mmm, I went to the
tennis club with him.

755
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:48,906
Trust me.
He doesn't wear underwear.

756
00:31:49,032 --> 00:31:50,365
I care about Rachel, too.

757
00:31:51,034 --> 00:31:53,035
Louis didn't do this.

758
00:31:54,662 --> 00:31:55,829
Okay.

759
00:31:57,790 --> 00:32:00,918
And if you ever mention Louis' underwear
situation to me again...

760
00:32:01,044 --> 00:32:02,252
You're the one
that brought it up.

761
00:32:02,378 --> 00:32:03,629
- Go.
- Okay.

762
00:32:07,467 --> 00:32:08,800
Seventy-four plaintiffs.

763
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:11,803
I can't believe they're willing to
cave for $25,000.

764
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:15,015
Slow down. We need to
figure out how to beat Tanner.

765
00:32:15,141 --> 00:32:17,726
Guy's been a step ahead
of me this entire time.

766
00:32:17,852 --> 00:32:18,977
Yeah, it's pretty
obvious why.

767
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:20,103
Why?

768
00:32:20,229 --> 00:32:23,482
You told me that you knew he'd go to
Kenny because that's what you'd do.

769
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:24,816
If you were willing
to go out of bounds.

770
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:28,737
You anticipated him by
thinking about what you'd do.

771
00:32:28,863 --> 00:32:29,863
And?

772
00:32:29,989 --> 00:32:31,740
And that's exactly what
he's doing to you.

773
00:32:31,866 --> 00:32:34,618
Maybe the only way to
get ahead of this guy is to...

774
00:32:34,744 --> 00:32:37,245
I don't know, think about
what you wouldn't do.

775
00:32:38,581 --> 00:32:40,958
Surprise myself. I like that.

776
00:32:41,084 --> 00:32:42,209
You're welcome.

777
00:32:42,335 --> 00:32:43,794
You going to tell me
what you're doing?

778
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,003
Nope.

779
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:47,589
That doesn't seem fair to
the person whose idea it was.

780
00:32:47,715 --> 00:32:49,049
Ah. You're gone.

781
00:32:53,763 --> 00:32:55,555
You wanted to talk, talk.

782
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:56,723
I did.

783
00:32:56,849 --> 00:32:59,142
I want to put this
competition aside.

784
00:32:59,268 --> 00:33:00,602
Call it a draw.

785
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:02,562
You tapping out, Harv?

786
00:33:02,689 --> 00:33:03,939
This isn't about that.

787
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:05,399
This is about
real people.

788
00:33:05,525 --> 00:33:07,859
You make them
a reasonable offer,

789
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:08,986
I'll get them to take it.

790
00:33:09,112 --> 00:33:10,529
Real people?

791
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:12,239
You're standing there
in a $12,000 suit

792
00:33:12,365 --> 00:33:14,825
asking me
not to do my job.

793
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:16,451
You care so much about
those real people,

794
00:33:16,577 --> 00:33:18,704
I suggest you give them
your lunch money.

795
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,539
But don't ask me for mine.

796
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:29,256
Vanessa. I'm going to
need that wiretap after all.

797
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:34,845
Is there any more of that?

798
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:36,179
Last cup.

799
00:33:36,472 --> 00:33:37,889
- Did you make any...
- No.

800
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:40,017
Dude, that's
common courtesy.

801
00:33:40,143 --> 00:33:42,269
You finish a pot,
you make another one.

802
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:44,813
Are you going to turn me
in to Louis if I don't?

803
00:33:44,939 --> 00:33:46,940
Hmm? Get me fired, too?

804
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:49,109
Michael.

805
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:53,739
Benjamin. You got
something for me?

806
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:56,158
A wager's a wager.
Fair is fair.

807
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:57,784
Here's your GX 9000.

808
00:33:57,910 --> 00:33:58,869
You're a good man.

809
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:01,580
Use it for porn,
and I'll know.

810
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:03,123
Weird.

811
00:34:03,249 --> 00:34:04,875
Hey, Louis. How you doing?

812
00:34:08,004 --> 00:34:10,047
Why did Benjamin
just call you Louis?

813
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:13,050
I don't know.
He made a mistake.

814
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:16,386
Oh.

815
00:34:18,264 --> 00:34:19,931
No, he didn't.

816
00:34:22,101 --> 00:34:23,685
He called you Louis
because he thinks you are Louis.

817
00:34:23,811 --> 00:34:24,811
What?

818
00:34:24,937 --> 00:34:26,938
Because you
posed as Louis

819
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:29,733
to get Rachel's
employee code, didn't you?

820
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:33,195
Look, Mike,
it's not what you think.

821
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:34,905
It's exactly what I think.

822
00:34:38,034 --> 00:34:39,951
Come on.
Start talking, Jimmy.

823
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:43,038
Or I'll go get Benjamin
and we can all go see Jessica together.

824
00:34:43,164 --> 00:34:44,456
Listen.

825
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:48,919
Wakefield-Cady offered me
a junior partnership

826
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:50,378
if I leaked the witness list.

827
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:51,797
No. No, listen, Mike.

828
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:54,257
I have huge
law school debts.

829
00:34:54,383 --> 00:34:56,343
Okay? I mean, don't you?

830
00:34:57,553 --> 00:35:00,097
I can't wait for Pearson Hardman to
make me a partner.

831
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:02,099
So what are you still
doing here, then?

832
00:35:05,186 --> 00:35:07,979
After I gave them the list,
they reneged on the offer.

833
00:35:08,856 --> 00:35:11,483
Big surprise. Yeah,
I didn't see that one coming.

834
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:15,112
Just don't turn me in,
Mike. Please?

835
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:18,532
I came from nothing.

836
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:23,411
I worked my ass off to get into Harvard
Law and become an associate here.

837
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:25,789
You know who else
worked their ass off?

838
00:35:26,165 --> 00:35:27,874
Rachel Zane.

839
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,001
The paralegal who got fired
because of what you did.

840
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:32,254
I didn't know
it was her code.

841
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:36,716
I just needed some numbers, man. I
didn't think I was going to get caught.

842
00:35:37,093 --> 00:35:39,136
Look, Mike,
I made one mistake.

843
00:35:39,262 --> 00:35:40,470
Okay?

844
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:43,181
I mean, haven't you ever
cut some corners?

845
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:45,350
Done some things
you regretted?

846
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:54,776
Jimmy, I like you,
man, okay?

847
00:35:55,778 --> 00:35:57,154
But to clear
Rachel's name,

848
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,156
they have to know
she wasn't the one.

849
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:03,118
If you come forward,

850
00:36:03,619 --> 00:36:04,995
maybe they fire you.

851
00:36:05,371 --> 00:36:07,122
If I turn you in,

852
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:10,208
it's going to follow you
for the rest of your career.

853
00:36:11,043 --> 00:36:12,794
It's up to you.

854
00:36:19,635 --> 00:36:21,386
Harvey, I'm going
to do you a favor.

855
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:24,389
Why don't you tell
Mike Ross to take a hike?

856
00:36:24,515 --> 00:36:25,891
He can stay.

857
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:27,893
Okay.

858
00:36:30,563 --> 00:36:32,939
You see, 95 of
your plaintiffs

859
00:36:33,065 --> 00:36:35,192
have already called me
about the settlement.

860
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:38,653
It's a matter of time before the rest of
them see the light. I win.

861
00:36:38,779 --> 00:36:40,322
I don't know
the last time you checked,

862
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:42,073
but as of this morning,

863
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,534
all two hundred of my plaintiffs are
staying with me.

864
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:45,535
Bullshit.

865
00:36:45,661 --> 00:36:47,370
I got them an advance
against their settlement.

866
00:36:47,496 --> 00:36:50,373
No finance company in
their right mind will back your suit.

867
00:36:50,499 --> 00:36:53,210
I don't know if they
taught you math at Yale,

868
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:56,880
but that's $5 million,
$25,000 a plaintiff.

869
00:36:57,298 --> 00:36:59,716
Exactly what you tried
to buy them off for.

870
00:37:00,801 --> 00:37:02,761
You know what this means.

871
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:04,721
I'm going to hammer them
all one by one.

872
00:37:04,847 --> 00:37:07,349
Break them down.
And it's going to get ugly.

873
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:08,767
No, you're not.

874
00:37:09,977 --> 00:37:11,311
What the hell is that?

875
00:37:11,437 --> 00:37:14,314
It's a conversation between
you and Emerson Petroleum,

876
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:17,692
discussing how you sent a man to
intimidate Kenny Verdasco.

877
00:37:18,027 --> 00:37:21,696
Take a listen. Don't worry.
It's not going to give you cancer.

878
00:37:21,822 --> 00:37:24,199
No matter what
that is, it's not admissible.

879
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:26,910
Unless, of course, you had a warrant.
Which you didn't.

880
00:37:29,997 --> 00:37:31,831
It showed up on my doorstep.

881
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:33,583
And I declared that
on this affidavit

882
00:37:33,709 --> 00:37:35,502
which I'm about to
send to court.

883
00:37:37,838 --> 00:37:38,838
Hmm.

884
00:37:39,632 --> 00:37:42,717
So you're going to perjure yourself just
to win this case.

885
00:37:42,843 --> 00:37:44,678
No. I'm not going
to perjure myself.

886
00:37:44,804 --> 00:37:47,222
Even if I were,
it wouldn't be just to win this case,

887
00:37:47,348 --> 00:37:49,641
it would be to get
your ass thrown in jail.

888
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:51,559
See, you have
power of attorney,

889
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:53,270
and you're going to
accept this settlement.

890
00:37:53,396 --> 00:37:56,106
$2 million a plaintiff.
You're going to take it.

891
00:37:56,232 --> 00:37:59,276
And you and that shit-eating grin are
going to fly back to Boston

892
00:37:59,402 --> 00:38:01,611
and never come back
to my town again.

893
00:38:11,163 --> 00:38:12,747
You can use mine.

894
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:32,475
I told you
I'd get his autograph.

895
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:36,062
I can't believe you.

896
00:38:36,188 --> 00:38:37,731
You were going to
perjure yourself just to win.

897
00:38:37,857 --> 00:38:39,482
I thought you
didn't cross lines.

898
00:38:39,608 --> 00:38:41,735
That's the difference
between guys like you and him.

899
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:44,779
I had no intention of
submitting this affidavit.

900
00:38:44,905 --> 00:38:46,031
I'm not going to
perjure myself.

901
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:48,658
But Tanner doesn't know that
and he never will.

902
00:38:48,784 --> 00:38:50,201
How do you know?

903
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:51,786
Because a man who's willing
to break the rules

904
00:38:51,912 --> 00:38:53,163
can't imagine
someone else wouldn't.

905
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:56,583
You said that you took my advice and
that you surprised yourself.

906
00:38:56,709 --> 00:38:59,461
I did. That loan I got
for the plaintiffs?

907
00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:02,297
I put up a million dollars
of my own money to get it.

908
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:06,676
If that's not having emotion,
I don't know what is.

909
00:39:06,802 --> 00:39:07,886
Get out.

910
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:09,846
That seemed a little angry.

911
00:39:09,972 --> 00:39:11,931
Feeling good?
Satisfied? Happy?

912
00:39:12,058 --> 00:39:14,225
All right. Emotional.

913
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:23,818
Okay, maybe a little happy.

914
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,950
Two million dollars?

915
00:39:31,077 --> 00:39:32,702
Didn't I tell you
he was my right hand?

916
00:39:32,828 --> 00:39:33,912
I don't know what to say.

917
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:34,913
You don't say anything.

918
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:38,208
You tell me what it's like
when you deliver this news to everyone.

919
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:39,959
Thank you.

920
00:39:44,298 --> 00:39:45,840
I told you I'd win.

921
00:39:45,966 --> 00:39:47,967
And it's a good thing, too.

922
00:39:48,094 --> 00:39:49,886
Because if you hadn't, oh...

923
00:39:52,014 --> 00:39:53,348
What, oh?

924
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:55,975
There's no way we were going to cover
that million dollars.

925
00:39:56,102 --> 00:39:56,976
None of it?

926
00:39:57,103 --> 00:40:00,021
Nope. Hey,
how's your shoulder?

927
00:40:00,147 --> 00:40:01,314
Amazing.

928
00:40:14,578 --> 00:40:15,495
You called me?

929
00:40:15,621 --> 00:40:16,871
Sure did.

930
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:20,959
Have a seat.

931
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:22,252
I'd prefer to stand.

932
00:40:24,004 --> 00:40:25,088
Fair enough.

933
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:29,217
Uh, I made a mistake.

934
00:40:31,053 --> 00:40:32,387
You were unfairly punished.

935
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:35,723
And I would like to officially just
welcome you back.

936
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:36,891
Thank you.

937
00:40:37,017 --> 00:40:38,101
You're welcome.

938
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:41,604
Are you kidding me?

939
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:44,232
You think I'm going to
make it that easy on you?

940
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:47,026
I want a raise.

941
00:40:49,029 --> 00:40:50,613
- Three percent.
- Ten percent.

942
00:40:51,991 --> 00:40:53,658
- Seven.
- Ten percent.

943
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:57,370
- Fine.
- And Pearson Hardman

944
00:40:57,496 --> 00:40:59,664
pays for law school
when I decide to go.

945
00:41:00,374 --> 00:41:01,749
Agreed.

946
00:41:02,751 --> 00:41:04,419
And one more thing.

947
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:07,172
This should have been the first words
out of your mouth

948
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:08,923
when I walked in here.

949
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:12,802
You need to apologize
to me right now.

950
00:41:13,554 --> 00:41:17,098
Or I'm going to file a lawsuit
against you first thing in the morning.

951
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:19,476
You're right.

952
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:21,186
I should have apologized.

953
00:41:22,021 --> 00:41:24,522
But don't you threaten me.

954
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:28,067
I followed procedure
to the letter

955
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:30,069
and you have no basis
for a lawsuit.

956
00:41:30,196 --> 00:41:31,738
No, I don't.

957
00:41:31,864 --> 00:41:33,114
Not about this.

958
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:35,325
But if you don't think
I have a basis

959
00:41:35,451 --> 00:41:38,953
for all the shit you've pulled
over the years I've been here,

960
00:41:40,372 --> 00:41:41,915
think again.

961
00:41:45,586 --> 00:41:47,086
I'm sorry.

962
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:48,963
Okay?

963
00:41:59,391 --> 00:42:00,850
How'd it go?

964
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:02,977
I don't know if you had
plans tonight,

965
00:42:03,103 --> 00:42:05,480
but you're going to cancel them and help
me put my office back together.

966
00:42:05,606 --> 00:42:08,733
Sure thing. Just as long as you don't
quit halfway through.

967
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:12,028
Thank you, Mike.

968
00:42:12,571 --> 00:42:14,405
Yeah. Sure thing.

969
00:42:17,243 --> 00:42:19,410
So, where does this go?

970
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:20,912
Over there.
