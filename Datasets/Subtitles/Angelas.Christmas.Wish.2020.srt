1
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:31,960
Where are we going?

2
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,320
Come on, Angela.

3
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,280
But who'll mind the sheep?

4
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:56,560
Dada, do you want to hear my song?

5
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:06,320
Goodbye, Angela.

6
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,320
Dada.

7
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,200
Say goodbye to your Dada.

8
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,960
-Safe journey!
-Goodbye!

9
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:24,960
Bye, Dada!

10
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,680
Safe journey!

11
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,480
Our Father,
who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name…

12
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,640
And-- And--

13
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,440
Ugh…

14
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,000
There's something else, Baby Jesus.

15
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,800
Oh, Mr. McGinty is having a baby cow!

16
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:02,600
Well, Mr. McGinty isn't having a baby cow.

17
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:06,520
His cow is having a baby cow.
Mam says he's a little bit worried,

18
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,960
as he can't be affording to get
a cow doctor with Christmas and all.

19
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:13,600
Maybe you could have
a word with Himself upstairs

20
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,520
to make sure everything's okay.

21
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,040
You would?

22
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,720
Thank you, Baby Jesus.

23
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,640
Do you want to hear my big news?

24
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,560
Mam is getting me a big Christmas

25
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,240
surprise!

26
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,040
Angela!

27
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,600
Sorry.

28
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,040
Now, between me and you,

29
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,400
I reckon it could be the doll

30
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,160
from Hartigan's Toy Shop!

31
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,280
Angela!

32
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:49,520
Oh, she's the most beautiful doll,
Baby Jesus.

33
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:53,880
Golden hair,
eyes as green as the Shannon.

34
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,880
And she's as cute as you.

35
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,600
Angela.

36
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,560
Look at your hair.

37
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,680
It's a knot of tangles.
You're washing it today.

38
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:07,000
Mam has been
in a woeful odd mood the last few days.

39
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,080
All cleaning and scrubbing and fussing.

40
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,520
Come on, will ye?

41
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,920
-Hush!
-See you later, Baby Jesus.

42
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,600
Goodbye, Joseph! Goodbye, Mary!

43
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,560
Goodbye, sheep! Goodbye, donkey!

44
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,480
Washed.

45
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,080
Doll! Doll! Doll! Doll! Doll!

46
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,560
Yeah, very nice.

47
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:58,000
Maybe Mam will get you some mittens.

48
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:13,160
Go on in. I just need to
have a quick word with Mrs. Blake.

49
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,600
Oh, 'tis yourself!

50
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,520
I heard about the big surprise.

51
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,040
The big Christmas surprise!

52
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:27,200
I'd be so grateful.
She'll be so excited.

53
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,160
She's going to be over the moon!

54
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,760
Quick!
Pretend we're playing a game.

55
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:36,160
-Well, if the princess demands it.

56
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,480
Don't listen to that fool.

57
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,760
Was that a nosy little pigtail I saw
swishing back away inside the house?

58
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,680
No.

59
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,160
No?

60
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,160
Uh, maybe?

61
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:51,240
-Why am I always the fool?
-Who do you want to be, Pat?

62
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:54,320
-Not the princess.
-Little Aggie could be the princess.

63
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,320
"Hello! I am Aggie, the princess!"

64
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,440
-Get away from the princess!
-Mother of Mary of Joseph.

65
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,760
I can't hear myself think.

66
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:08,840
My queen! The princess demands a story!

67
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,040
Go and tidy your room.

68
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:15,960
Go on.

69
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,640
Come on. The queen's in a bad mood.

70
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,440
-Again.
-Pat!

71
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,320
It's Christmas Eve.

72
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,320
You'll all be getting something nice.

73
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,600
Now, go on. Clean your room.

74
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,000
Clean. Clean. Clean.

75
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,480
Wait.

76
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,400
There's always time for a story.

77
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,360
Come on. Sit.

78
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,320
-Story!

79
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,240
Ready?

80
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,680
Once upon a time,

81
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:54,360
in a faraway land--

82
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,120
Australia?

83
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,360
Once upon a time, in Australia,

84
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:03,840
there was a big, fat king
and a skinny, little pauper.

85
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,160
One day, the king
and the pauper bumped into a magic genie.

86
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:15,000
Well, the genie was in a fantastic mood,
so he offered them both one wish each.

87
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,320
One wish each?

88
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,040
The king loudly shouted,

89
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:22,720
"I wish, I wish,
I wish for all the gold in the world!"

90
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:27,320
Now it was the pauper's turn
to make his wish.

91
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:30,600
The pauper walked into a corner

92
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:33,240
and turned away
from the king and the genie.

93
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,760
He shut his eyes.

94
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:39,040
"I wish, I wish…

95
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,320
I wish."

96
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,720
What did the pauper wish for?

97
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,280
Years later,
the king and pauper met again.

98
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,360
Well, wasn't the king
now driven demented with the gold?

99
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,680
It was in his socks,

100
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,680
his boots,

101
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,120
under his pillow.

102
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,600
But the pauper,

103
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:05,120
well, the pauper was just
the happiest man alive.

104
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,560
The king was desperate to know

105
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:10,960
what in the name of God
did the pauper wish for?

106
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:14,120
The king pleaded and pleaded,

107
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,240
"Tell me your wish.

108
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,600
Tell me your wish.

109
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,240
Tell me your wish."

110
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,000
The pauper smiled.

111
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:24,160
"All right," says he, "Hm. I'll tell you."

112
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,600
"I wished,

113
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,200
I wished,

114
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,120
I wished…"

115
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,920
What did he wish for?

116
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,360
Clean your room and I'll tell you.

117
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,800
Mam!

118
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,160
Come on. Go, go, go.

119
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,080
We have to get this house shipshape.

120
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,720
He was the happiest man alive.

121
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,640
Maybe he wished for…
Maybe it was--

122
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,120
Tom?
Do you think Mam's all right?

123
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,520
She's been acting funny for days,

124
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,960
all rushing and fussing.

125
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,320
It's the same every year.

126
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,920
Mam misses Da.

127
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,560
Christmas, New Year, your birthday.

128
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:08,480
With Da away working, it's hard on her.

129
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,640
You go first.

130
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,440
I miss singing him my song.

131
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,680
Your turn. What do you miss?

132
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,480
-The way he smelled like horses.

133
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,720
-Horses?

134
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,240
No, like the saddles do.

135
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:56,400
Warm and, uh… and leathery.

136
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,600
What do you miss?

137
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,320
His laugh.

138
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,600
The one he had when he played with us.

139
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,640
And Mam?

140
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,400
What-- What do you think Mam misses?

141
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,600
She told me once she missed--

142
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,280
Aggie's eating Da!

143
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,680
Oh, careful, Aggie.

144
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,080
And do you miss Dada?

145
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,240
Man.

146
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,280
Dada.

147
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,640
Man.

148
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,520
- Tom?
-Yes, Mam?

149
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,920
Come down and help me with the coal.

150
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,400
Mam misses Da. Pat misses Da.

151
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,120
Tom misses Da.

152
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,960
I miss Da.

153
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,120
I know what we do!

154
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:57,080
We're digging to Australia
to get Da home for Christmas!

155
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,240
Don't tell Mam.

156
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,760
Do you know how long that would take?

157
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,880
You'll be years.

158
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:08,200
What are you doing to my yard?

159
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,440
Nothing.

160
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,760
Bring your messing somewhere else.

161
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,880
Aw.

162
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
What--

163
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,840
Run!

164
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:32,200
My lovely little ga--

165
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,360
What are you two up to?

166
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,440
Nothing.

167
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,080
Can we go look at the shops?

168
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:42,240
Go on.
Get you away from under my feet.

169
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:43,720
And don't be late!

170
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:44,800
We won't!

171
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,760
I mean it.
Be back here for five o'clock sharp.

172
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,680
-We will!
-You won't be getting away from it!

173
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:53,160
I know where ye live. Don't forget!

174
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,520
Who's good at digging holes?

175
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,760
That fella from the church.

176
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:05,320
He's always digging holes
in the field behind St. Joseph's.

177
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,800
Or Jack White's dog.

178
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,320
How far did we dig?

179
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,680
Eh…

180
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,360
About one boot?

181
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,800
Maybe Tom was right.

182
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:18,360
It would take years to dig to Australia,

183
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,760
even with Frankie and Jack White's dog.

184
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,560
We'd never get Da home for Christmas.

185
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,080
Eh…

186
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,920
If we aren't digging down,

187
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,600
how do we know which way to go?

188
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,040
We need to go look at the map!

189
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,680
Hello, Christmas surprise!

190
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,280
I can't wait for you to meet my Da!

191
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,200
Ah!

192
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,560
A toffee apple?

193
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:48,120
A toffee apple the size of me head.

194
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,760
That's what you think
the pauper wished for?

195
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:53,280
Well, they make me happy.

196
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,040
Is that what you'd wish for?

197
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,920
I'd wish for the elephant
in Timmy Quinn's picture book.

198
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,640
Now, would this elephant
be living in Limerick?

199
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:05,080
Hm. Didn't look like he was, no.

200
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:09,480
Because no one
would be keeping an elephant in Limerick!

201
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,560
Sure she would be freezing.

202
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,680
You'd have to put a coat,
hat, and mittens on her!

203
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,480
What do you think Aggie would wish for?

204
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,880
Lots and lots of snuggles.

205
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,960
-Tom?
-A coat!

206
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,920
-Mam?
-Da!

207
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,640
What would Da wish for?

208
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,800
To be home with us.

209
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,680
We really need that map.

210
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,880
You two. You know the rules.

211
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:45,480
They're clean. Honest.

212
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,520
Hands?

213
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:07,960
Fine.

214
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,240
Remember.

215
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,200
Shh.

216
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,840
On the postcards Da sends,

217
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:21,560
Australia looks like an upside down dog.

218
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,560
It looks far away, Angela.

219
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,280
Ireland…

220
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,160
Ireland…

221
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,160
-Ireland!
-Where's Limerick?

222
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,200
Um…

223
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,600
Around…

224
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,240
Uh…

225
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,640
Around here.

226
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,880
And Australia?

227
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,720
Wait! Go back.

228
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:54,640
There!

229
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,200
What bit is Da in?

230
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,040
"Grong…" "Grong."

231
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
"Woolloomooloo."

232
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,320
-Sh-sh.

233
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,000
Pat, shush.

234
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,200
-It's near!
-Really?

235
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,720
Only four pages!

236
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,360
Only four pages?
We could get a train to Australia!

237
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,000
And be there in an hour.

238
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,520
We'll have him home for tea!

239
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,280
Wait. Let me see Woolloomooloo again.

240
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,840
Stop your messing!

241
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,200
-You're messing.
-Pat!

242
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,400
-Give me the book!
-Give me the book!

243
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,440
I-- I'll just put this back.

244
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,080
I don't know why you have
to be quiet in libraries.

245
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,440
You should be allowed to read out loud.
Then everyone could hear the stories.

246
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:06,320
Even the people who can't read.
Oh, Mr. McGinty!

247
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,440
Mr. McGinty!

248
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,920
-Mam says you're having a cow!
-A holy baby Christmas cow?

249
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:18,960
Holy baby?
Uh, mommy cow is a bit slow on it.

250
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,760
Slow? Will she be all right?

251
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,000
God willing.

252
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:25,760
I was just in having a word
with Himself, you know?

253
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,120
Oh, I do.

254
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,120
What are you naming the baby cow?

255
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:32,240
Naming? Eh, sure.

256
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,600
Where would you be at all, at all?

257
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:36,920
Socks!

258
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,400
We will call him Socks.

259
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,080
Socks the calf it is, Angela.

260
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,880
Socks the calf it is.

261
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,080
Eh…

262
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,040
Mam says you've no money for the vet.

263
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,360
Pat Sheehan!

264
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,040
I'm sorry, Mr. McGinty.

265
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,800
Pat still has to learn,

266
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,760
you hold your tongue to hold your friends.

267
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,760
Ah, you're grand.

268
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:02,320
Your Ma is right as always.
I don't have two coins to rub together.

269
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:06,120
And for the money that vet charges,
you could buy three cows.

270
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,880
Well, I better get back to check on her.

271
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:11,440
Tell Socks we'll call him
when we get back!

272
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:14,000
I'll let Socks know to expect you.

273
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,120
Socks for Christmas.

274
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,760
I would recognize

275
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:29,320
those little footsteps anywhere.

276
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,880
-Hello.
-Hello.

277
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:34,680
And what are you two
doing out and about

278
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,680
on this Christmas Eve?

279
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,240
We're on a secret mission.

280
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,320
And would this secret mission

281
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:48,520
be too secret to tell little old me?

282
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,280
Thanking you kindly.

283
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:55,600
We're getting our Da back from
Australia as a Christmas surprise for Mam.

284
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:56,960
We're going on the train.

285
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,440
To Australia?

286
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,680
And thanks to you, kind person.

287
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,400
Tickets?

288
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:13,040
How much is a ticket to Australia?

289
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:17,000
Oh, that would cost a lot, Master Pat.

290
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,720
- Thank you!

291
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,680
Come on! I have a plan.

292
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,000
Merry Christmas!

293
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,920
And a merry Christmas to you.

294
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,880
No way, Angela.

295
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,920
We need the money for the ticket.

296
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:44,000
-Why don't we--
-No, no, no, Pat.

297
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:47,120
I've a good mind to send you
right home and go in on my own.

298
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,480
Grand.

299
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,400
Grand.

300
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,520
On you go.

301
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:56,760
Quite so.

302
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,160
Quite so.

303
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,360
Ugh! Scaredy-cat!

304
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,720
Yeah? I'm not a scaredy…

305
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:05,680
cat.

306
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:14,040
-Is that the girl that took the baby Jes--
-Sh!

307
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,560
Dig deep, boys. Dig deep.

308
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,280
We're getting a ticket!

309
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,160
We're getting a train.

310
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,880
We're getting Da!

311
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,200
Holy mother of Mary!

312
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,160
If you're not digging holes,
you're running into me.

313
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,920
Sorry, Mrs. Blake.

314
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,600
What are you two up to?

315
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,120
Getting a surprise for Mam.

316
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:27,160
A surprise, is it?

317
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,760
Hm. 'Tis.

318
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,600
Seems to be a day for surprises.

319
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,280
Oh, Mrs. Blake!

320
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,320
Did you hear any news about Socks?

321
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,480
I mean, Mr. McGinty's calf?

322
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:44,480
Not good, Angela. Not good.
That man needs to be getting the vet.

323
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,880
That's all I'll say.

324
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,120
Don't be late home!

325
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:54,320
-We have to help Socks.
-We don't even know where the vet lives.

326
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,560
Sh-sh.

327
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:06,480
Hurry up.

328
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:10,840
If any of ye had a poorly cow, um,
where would you go to get the vet?

329
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,520
Uh, we need a vet for a cow!

330
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:27,400
You're the girl who stole
the baby Jesus from the church.

331
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,920
It is you, isn't it?

332
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,440
-Dorothy?
-Mother!

333
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:34,400
This is the girl who took
the Baby Jesus from St. Joseph's.

334
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,800
Nice to meet you both.

335
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,720
Come along, Dorothy.

336
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:40,240
Get back inside
before you let the heat out.

337
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,400
I was keeping him warm.

338
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:48,040
The baby Jesus was cold in the church,
so I took him home to warm him.

339
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:52,000
Well, then you better both come in.

340
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,440
Will the vet help?

341
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:55,640
Let's ask him.

342
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,400
Sit, sit, please.

343
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,040
That's Father's chair.

344
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,480
The Da has two chairs.

345
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,960
Would you like to hear some music?

346
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,080
Nothing too hectic, please.

347
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,280
Dorothy.

348
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:54,480
Es tut mir leid!

349
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:57,440
-That's means "I'm sorry."
-Now, children.

350
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,920
Are you getting
anything nice for Christmas?

351
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,600
-I love Christmas!

352
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:06,000
Dorothy, please let our guests talk.

353
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:10,360
-Mam is getting me a big surprise.
-And we're getting Mam a big surprise.

354
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,680
What are you getting her?

355
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,680
We're getting our Da
home for Christmas.

356
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:15,640
Home?

357
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:19,520
-He went to Australia for work.
-We tried digging--

358
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,640
I would love to dig to Australia.

359
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,640
What an adventure!

360
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:26,120
And they have so many
fascinating animals.

361
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:30,160
Kangaroos, koala bears, wallabies!

362
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:33,960
Wallabies.
We checked the map in the library.

363
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:34,960
It's not that far.

364
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,520
Oh, my darling.

365
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,280
Father,
what other animals live in Australia?

366
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,640
You must know them all.

367
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,160
There are simply
too many marsupials to list.

368
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,800
Speaking of animals…

369
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,160
Yes?

370
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,640
- Mr. McGinty's cow?
-Of course!

371
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,200
Father, Angela has something to ask you.

372
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,160
Um…

373
00:24:58,520 --> 00:24:59,360
Hello.

374
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:02,400
My friend's cow, she-- 
She's having a baby.

375
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,800
My friend's cow needs a vet.

376
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,520
-I could help you, Father!
-And our Da.

377
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,320
-Our Da could also help.
-What a great idea!

378
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,000
Then, Father will have
more time to play with me!

379
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,400
Excuse me.

380
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:21,280
Maybe I'm mistaken.

381
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,480
Did you say your father could help?

382
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,560
He's really good with his hands.
And he loves animals.

383
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,280
The father who's in Australia?

384
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,440
We're getting him back.

385
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,680
That's simply absurd.

386
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,680
-Edward.
-What does "absurd" mean?

387
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:41,240
It doesn't matter. Let's all eat our cake.

388
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,280
We're-- We're getting a train.

389
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,840
Oh, I thought you were digging.

390
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:50,800
Digging-- Digging didn't…

391
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:51,800
work.

392
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,920
And the train will?

393
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,280
What's it going to do
when it gets to the water?

394
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:02,880
Precisely.

395
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,000
We're getting Da back.

396
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:12,520
I'll tell you what. I'll make you a deal.

397
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:17,920
Get your father back,
and I will help your cow.

398
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:21,840
Deal.

399
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:25,360
Uh, is-- Is that clean?

400
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,560
I washed it in the snow.

401
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,160
How exciting!

402
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,640
I really must apologize
for Edward's behavior.

403
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:42,960
He's just so terribly tired.
Working every hour has him out of sorts.

404
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,960
I do hope you get your father home.

405
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:59,400
At least we now have cake for our journey.

406
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:06,080
What would that vet know?
He's probably never been to Australia!

407
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:10,240
Probably never even been on a train.
And besides, he's just-- What?

408
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:16,880
I-- I wanted to show it
to people when we got there.

409
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,880
Show them what Da looks like,

410
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,520
so they would know who we mean.

411
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,600
The vet was right, Angela.

412
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,320
Where are you going?

413
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,120
We will get him home, Pat.

414
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,040
I can help.

415
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,080
I can help get your father home.

416
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:35,920
Help?

417
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,320
Father was right.

418
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,440
You can't take the train to Australia,

419
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,200
but I do know another way.

420
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:46,280
So, the king pleas, "Tell me your wish!"

421
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:47,600
"Tell me your wish!

422
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,160
Tell me your wish!"

423
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:50,680
The pauper smiles.

424
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:53,400
"All right," says he, "I'll tell you."

425
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:57,600
"I wished… I wished… I wished…"

426
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,680
What did he wish for?

427
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,920
I don't know.
Mam never finished the story.

428
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:07,040
I wish… I wish…

429
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,160
I wish…

430
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,560
Father would play with me and my dolls.

431
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:16,600
Our Da used to play with us all the time.

432
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,640
Did your father not have to work?

433
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,920
Mam says he worked at the milk mart.

434
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,240
-But they didn't need him anymore.
-Is that why he went away?

435
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:26,160
Yeah.

436
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,600
Then let's go get him home.

437
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,840
Three tickets to Australia, please.

438
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:37,160
Huh?

439
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:38,960
Yeah, funny.

440
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,160
Australia, please.

441
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:44,880
Very good, huh?

442
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,760
"Ticket to Australia, sir."
On you go, yours.

443
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,360
Take it up!

444
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,000
Everybody out.

445
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,440
There's yourself.

446
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:42,000
- Are we light?
- Yeah.

447
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,480
-Sending the boat away?
- Going in five.

448
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:46,600
And that's me done for Christmas.

449
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:51,520
See you. Best wishes to you,
Diane, and the children in the new year.

450
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,640
-And you. Better be off.
-Right now.

451
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:38,280
All aboard!

452
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:39,760
Hey!

453
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:52,680
-Whoa, whoa, whoa. Come here.

454
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,760
-Let me go!
-Come here, sweetie.

455
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:00,040
Get Da!

456
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,360
Here you go.

457
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:27,880
You dropped this.

458
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:30,520
Thank you.

459
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,200
I'm sorry about your boots.

460
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,800
I'm sorry we didn't get your Da home.

461
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:45,360
Do you think you'll be
in big trouble with your father?

462
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:47,920
He probably won't even notice.

463
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:50,720
Your mammy said he's tired.

464
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,120
He's always tired.

465
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:12,240
Mother of God!

466
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,800
I-- I-- I  just went to--

467
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:16,720
Dorothy!

468
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,120
Are you all right?

469
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:29,240
Dorothy was helping get our Da home.

470
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,920
So you'd have
more time to play with her.

471
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,160
And did you?

472
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:37,320
Did you bring your father home?

473
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:39,720
No.

474
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:47,640
Can we make a stop?

475
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,960
I never sang him my song, Baby Jesus.

476
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,760
I never sang him my song.

477
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,040
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

478
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,720
What is it?

479
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:56,480
I didn't get your Christmas surprise.

480
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:00,640
Oh, my darling. It doesn't matter.

481
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:04,440
I… I broke it.

482
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,840
It's just a silly frame. Come on.

483
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,320
Let's have some cocoa.

484
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,240
It's Christmas Eve.

485
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,560
He wished to be happy.

486
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,280
The pauper.

487
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:31,880
That was his wish.

488
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,880
He could have had anything in the world,

489
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:37,000
but when he looked into his heart,

490
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:38,720
when he listened,

491
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,520
the words just came to him.

492
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:42,640
I wish…

493
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,160
I wish…

494
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,440
I wish…

495
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,200
To be happy.

496
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:51,880
Try it with me.

497
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:55,080
Wishes don't work.

498
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,400
Try it with me.

499
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,760
Listen to your hearts.

500
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,760
Listen to what they want.

501
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,120
Tom?

502
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:08,840
-I wish, I wish, I wish.

503
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,520
Pat, you next.

504
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,160
Go on.

505
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:18,960
I wish…

506
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,400
I wish…

507
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,960
I wish…

508
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:24,000
-Wishy! Wishy! Wishy!

509
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:24,960
I'm okay.

510
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,040
Angela?

511
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:48,600
I wish…

512
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:50,360
I wish…

513
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:52,200
I wish…

514
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:08,960
Happy Christmas, Angela.

515
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:27,760
Surprise.

516
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:32,440
I wished for Da. Da!

517
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:33,360
He's here!

518
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,200
Me-- Me too!

519
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,640
Da! Da!

520
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:39,200
Happy Christmas, everyone.

521
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:41,000
Dada!

522
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,240
Dada!

523
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,760
Dada!

524
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:49,560
It's really you.

525
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:53,040
It's really him!

526
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,920
You got my letter.

527
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:05,240
They didn't suspect a thing.

528
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:06,840
Wait!

529
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:09,640
You're really here!

530
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:11,600
He's really here.

531
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:13,560
You're back! Come on!

532
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:18,560
We had a deal!

533
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:21,800
I get my Da home,
you help McGinty's cow.

534
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:24,040
-How on Earth did you--
- Father?

535
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:31,600
Um…

536
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,320
Uh…

537
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:37,840
How did you get your father home?

538
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,200
I wished!

539
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,680
Wishes work?

540
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:44,520
I wish…

541
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:45,840
I wish…

542
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,320
I wish…

543
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:53,080
You were correct about one thing.

544
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,200
I really could do with some help.

545
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:00,480
Then let's go and help that cow.

546
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:03,440
I just wish I knew what was going on.

547
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:06,920
You'll get used to it.

548
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,640
Angela, thank you.

549
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:13,400
Daddy, did you know?

550
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:18,520
Once upon in Australia there was this big,
fat king and this skinny, little pauper.

551
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:22,280
Really? Wow, um, were they friends?

552
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,280
Da?

553
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:38,320
Do you want to hear my song?

554
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:04,800
Horsies.

555
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:15,920
Happy Christmas, Angela.

556
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:18,960
Happy Christmas.

557
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:23,440
Happy Christmas…

558
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:26,440
Dada.
