1
00:00:22,023 --> 00:00:23,983
200 million years ago,

2
00:00:24,108 --> 00:00:27,570
our planet looked very different
from what it does today.

3
00:00:27,695 --> 00:00:30,114
It was entirely covered by sea,

4
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:35,286
which surrounded one single
supercontinent we call Pangaea.

5
00:00:37,038 --> 00:00:40,124
And then Pangaea began to break up.

6
00:00:42,251 --> 00:00:46,964
Life was cast adrift on fragments of land.

7
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:53,971
And these fragments eventually
became our seven continents.

8
00:00:56,182 --> 00:00:59,977
We will see how life developed
on each continent,

9
00:01:00,102 --> 00:01:05,775
giving rise to the extraordinary
and wonderful diversity that we see today.

10
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:11,697
We'll venture to the frozen wilderness
of Antarctica...

11
00:01:13,282 --> 00:01:17,119
...where life thrives against the odds...

12
00:01:18,746 --> 00:01:21,874
...and to the riches of South America,

13
00:01:21,999 --> 00:01:23,834
full of the unexpected...

14
00:01:28,214 --> 00:01:30,466
...from the wilds of Africa...

15
00:01:32,802 --> 00:01:37,390
...to the vast expanses of North America

16
00:01:37,515 --> 00:01:40,810
and the searing heat of Australia.

17
00:01:42,728 --> 00:01:47,149
We'll explore the remote reaches
of Asia...

18
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:50,653
...home to rarely seen creatures...

19
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:57,827
...and Europe,
a world transformed by humanity.

20
00:02:03,666 --> 00:02:09,422
And we'll discover how this may be
the most critical moment for life on Earth

21
00:02:09,547 --> 00:02:11,465
since the continents formed.

22
00:02:12,925 --> 00:02:16,095
We are changing the world so rapidly

23
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:21,392
that wildlife is now facing
some of its greatest challenges yet.

24
00:02:24,312 --> 00:02:27,315
Never has it been
a more important time

25
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,985
to reveal the precious diversity of life

26
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:33,779
on our seven continents.

27
00:02:57,345 --> 00:03:02,433
This is Seven Worlds, One Planet.

28
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:31,504
Of all the continents...

29
00:03:33,005 --> 00:03:38,386
...one was first sighted by humans
just 200 years ago.

30
00:03:41,597 --> 00:03:47,645
And only now are we beginning to
understand what it takes to survive here.

31
00:03:54,068 --> 00:03:57,029
It's the most hostile of them all.

32
00:04:11,961 --> 00:04:15,881
98% of mainland Antarctica,

33
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:21,178
an area one and a half times
the size of the United States,

34
00:04:21,303 --> 00:04:23,431
is covered in ice...

35
00:04:23,556 --> 00:04:26,767
...on which virtually nothing can live.

36
00:04:33,858 --> 00:04:38,070
So life is dependent on the ocean
that surrounds it.

37
00:04:40,823 --> 00:04:43,242
But even the ocean freezes.

38
00:04:46,328 --> 00:04:50,875
Only one mammal
can live this far south...

39
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:55,504
...the Weddell seal.

40
00:04:58,757 --> 00:05:01,427
She has to keep her breathing hole open

41
00:05:01,552 --> 00:05:05,097
by grinding back the ice with her teeth.

42
00:05:17,568 --> 00:05:20,529
Out here on the sea ice,

43
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:25,367
all these seals are far from the predators
of the open ocean...

44
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:31,081
...so this is the safest place
for her to give birth.

45
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:37,171
Leaving the warmth of the womb
and landing on ice

46
00:05:37,296 --> 00:05:42,259
is the sharpest drop in temperature
any animal ever faces.

47
00:05:51,185 --> 00:05:56,732
But her pup can't swim
for the first ten days of its life.

48
00:06:02,238 --> 00:06:05,824
It's trapped here, out on the ice.

49
00:06:27,429 --> 00:06:29,515
She shields her pup from the wind.

50
00:06:31,976 --> 00:06:34,144
Although it's spring,
temperatures can drop

51
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:38,482
to minus 40 degrees Celsius

52
00:06:38,607 --> 00:06:41,402
and blizzards can rage for days.

53
00:07:05,843 --> 00:07:10,014
Three days on,
and the storm is still raging.

54
00:07:11,473 --> 00:07:15,269
She now faces the hardest of decisions.

55
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:22,401
Does she stay with her pup?

56
00:07:28,574 --> 00:07:31,201
Or shelter in the water?

57
00:07:55,476 --> 00:08:01,690
Now her pup's best chance of survival
is for the storm to pass quickly.

58
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:29,093
Some pups didn't make it.

59
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,648
An answer.

60
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:03,919
If this pup now joins its mother
in the water,

61
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:07,256
it will be safe from any future storm.

62
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:19,351
It's minus 2 degrees Celsius,

63
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:25,524
but being in water is warmer
than lying on the ice in the howling wind.

64
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:35,826
Its chances of surviving here
are now extremely good.

65
00:09:47,212 --> 00:09:53,177
Only a few hardy animals can live
all year round as far south as this.

66
00:09:55,888 --> 00:09:58,974
Further from the Pole,
on the fringes of the continent,

67
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:02,561
lie islands that are free of sea ice.

68
00:10:07,316 --> 00:10:11,445
Here there are other challenges.

69
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:19,661
Saint Andrews Bay on South Georgia

70
00:10:19,787 --> 00:10:23,874
is packed with half a million
king penguins.

71
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:35,511
In spring, the chicks are left for days

72
00:10:35,636 --> 00:10:39,348
whilst their parents are away
collecting food for them.

73
00:10:41,517 --> 00:10:44,228
There is a simple arrangement.

74
00:10:44,353 --> 00:10:47,981
The chicks must stay exactly
where their parents left them

75
00:10:48,106 --> 00:10:50,442
to be sure of being found again.

76
00:11:01,954 --> 00:11:06,124
But this chick has decided
to look around.

77
00:11:15,217 --> 00:11:18,262
There is a lot to be investigated.

78
00:12:04,141 --> 00:12:07,853
But it must not stray too far
from its meeting place.

79
00:12:11,648 --> 00:12:16,403
This parent has returned
with food in its crop.

80
00:12:16,528 --> 00:12:21,199
But its chick isn't where it left it.

81
00:12:23,827 --> 00:12:27,873
It's hard to stay put
when there's so much to play with.

82
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:33,503
Elephant seals are here too.

83
00:12:37,174 --> 00:12:39,051
Very mysterious.

84
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:11,083
Finding it in the crowd of youngsters
is not going to be easy.

85
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:15,379
They must recognise each other
by their calls.

86
00:13:21,176 --> 00:13:23,303
But to hear these
in such a noisy colony

87
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:26,765
they must be within 15 metres
of each other.

88
00:13:58,547 --> 00:14:00,507
Reunited.

89
00:14:11,727 --> 00:14:16,231
Saint Andrews beach is one
of the most crowded on the planet,

90
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:21,236
and so holding a territory here
is a constant battle.

91
00:14:24,865 --> 00:14:31,830
This bull elephant seal holds
the mating rights to 60 females.

92
00:14:33,915 --> 00:14:40,047
For two months,
he's guarded this stretch of beach.

93
00:14:40,172 --> 00:14:44,801
Unable to feed,
he's losing ten kilos a day...

94
00:14:45,844 --> 00:14:49,056
...and he's exhausted.

95
00:14:51,975 --> 00:14:55,896
But other bulls are lying around,
waiting their chance.

96
00:16:08,677 --> 00:16:11,471
Blubber 15cm thick

97
00:16:11,596 --> 00:16:13,306
is protection against the cold,

98
00:16:13,431 --> 00:16:17,644
but not from the impact
of a four-tonne opponent.

99
00:16:48,008 --> 00:16:53,597
He holds his ground
and forces the intruder back out to sea.

100
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:06,234
Life in the Antarctic is harsh indeed,

101
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:08,486
but all these creatures come here

102
00:17:08,612 --> 00:17:13,533
because the Southern Ocean
is one of the richest on Earth.

103
00:17:16,286 --> 00:17:18,371
When, 30 million years ago,

104
00:17:18,496 --> 00:17:22,959
the continent broke away
from South America and drifted south,

105
00:17:23,084 --> 00:17:26,546
currents began to swirl right around it.

106
00:17:32,344 --> 00:17:37,015
They are now the strongest
of any currents on the planet.

107
00:17:42,062 --> 00:17:45,440
They sweep up nutrients from the depths

108
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:51,196
and so create one of the richest
feeding grounds in all the world's oceans.

109
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:58,536
And some of the creatures
that come here to feast

110
00:17:58,662 --> 00:18:02,457
do so in a most sophisticated way.

111
00:18:22,185 --> 00:18:24,312
Humpback whales.

112
00:18:28,108 --> 00:18:31,820
It's summer,
and they've come here for a banquet.

113
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:53,341
The cold waters
contain great shoals of krill.

114
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:59,556
It's estimated that
there are 400 trillion of them

115
00:18:59,681 --> 00:19:01,599
and that their combined weight is greater

116
00:19:01,725 --> 00:19:06,062
than that of any other animal species
on the planet.

117
00:19:09,441 --> 00:19:14,195
To collect them, the humpbacks
blow curtains of bubbles

118
00:19:14,321 --> 00:19:16,614
which the krill won't cross.

119
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:26,791
The whales then rise,

120
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:30,920
spiralling inwards
to concentrate the swarm.

121
00:19:44,267 --> 00:19:48,229
Summer in Antarctica is a time of plenty,

122
00:19:48,355 --> 00:19:53,401
when most humpbacks are able to put on
the reserves they need for the whole year.

123
00:19:57,364 --> 00:20:02,160
But the wildlife in these waters
faces an uncertain future.

124
00:20:07,332 --> 00:20:10,835
The Southern Ocean is warming.

125
00:20:16,466 --> 00:20:20,929
90% of the world's ice
lies in Antarctica,

126
00:20:21,054 --> 00:20:26,810
and in some parts the rate at which
it's melting is doubling every decade.

127
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:31,940
Sea levels are rising.

128
00:20:33,608 --> 00:20:36,653
But there is a more immediate threat.

129
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,783
The warming of the coldest region on Earth

130
00:20:41,908 --> 00:20:46,329
is having a profound effect
on global weather patterns.

131
00:20:47,664 --> 00:20:53,628
And this change in the climate
is already being felt right here.

132
00:20:58,174 --> 00:21:02,846
This grey-headed albatross chick
is four weeks old.

133
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:09,144
So far, it has been sheltered
from the gales by its parents,

134
00:21:09,227 --> 00:21:13,356
who take turns to collect food for it
out at sea.

135
00:21:19,487 --> 00:21:23,616
It is the only chick
that they will have in two years.

136
00:21:32,542 --> 00:21:36,838
A delicate touching of beaks
strengthens their bond.

137
00:21:57,108 --> 00:22:01,988
But these tender moments
cannot last for ever.

138
00:22:05,909 --> 00:22:10,622
As a chick grows, so does its appetite,

139
00:22:10,747 --> 00:22:15,001
so one parent has to leave to find food
before the other returns.

140
00:22:19,506 --> 00:22:22,634
Parting is a big step,

141
00:22:22,759 --> 00:22:24,761
and they take time over it.

142
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:05,093
For the first time in its life,

143
00:23:05,218 --> 00:23:07,595
this chick is alone.

144
00:23:17,188 --> 00:23:20,358
The Antarctic is the windiest continent,

145
00:23:20,483 --> 00:23:24,821
and in recent years,
climate change has brought storms

146
00:23:24,946 --> 00:23:28,908
that are more frequent
and even more powerful.

147
00:23:38,293 --> 00:23:42,630
Winds now regularly reach 70mph.

148
00:23:49,596 --> 00:23:54,601
But the albatross chicks
must try to stay on their nests.

149
00:24:50,948 --> 00:24:53,451
Surviving the storm is one thing...

150
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:59,791
...but now, off the nest
in these freezing temperatures,

151
00:24:59,916 --> 00:25:03,670
this chick has just hours to live.

152
00:25:15,014 --> 00:25:18,476
The brutal conditions
have taken their toll.

153
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:26,150
Some chicks have already succumbed
to exposure.

154
00:25:38,496 --> 00:25:40,665
The bond is so strong

155
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:44,210
it can be hard for a father to let go.

156
00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:50,258
The albatross population here

157
00:25:50,383 --> 00:25:54,804
has more than halved in the last 15 years.

158
00:25:58,516 --> 00:26:02,061
These albatross are facing extinction.

159
00:26:04,522 --> 00:26:09,485
They simply cannot keep pace
with the changes affecting their world.

160
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:36,053
More parents are returning
to the colony.

161
00:26:47,273 --> 00:26:49,525
Something is not right.

162
00:26:53,112 --> 00:26:55,823
The nest should not be empty.

163
00:27:06,751 --> 00:27:10,838
The chick is actually
right below its parent,

164
00:27:10,963 --> 00:27:15,676
but because it's not on the nest,
the parent doesn't recognise it...

165
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,814
...and doesn't help it.

166
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:34,612
Strangely, perhaps,

167
00:27:34,737 --> 00:27:38,449
these albatross do not recognise
their chicks by sight,

168
00:27:38,574 --> 00:27:41,619
sound or smell.

169
00:27:42,912 --> 00:27:47,667
They identify them
by finding them on the nest.

170
00:27:49,961 --> 00:27:54,382
So these violent storms
have created a problem

171
00:27:54,507 --> 00:27:58,344
that the albatross
are not equipped to solve.

172
00:28:06,686 --> 00:28:08,938
If it is to survive,

173
00:28:09,063 --> 00:28:12,692
the chick will have to
get back on the nest by itself.

174
00:29:14,211 --> 00:29:16,714
The chick has made it.

175
00:29:19,091 --> 00:29:22,428
The bond is re-established immediately

176
00:29:22,553 --> 00:29:25,973
and its parent once again
provides the warmth

177
00:29:26,098 --> 00:29:29,101
that the chick so desperately needs.

178
00:29:37,818 --> 00:29:40,780
It's safe... for now.

179
00:30:03,219 --> 00:30:06,931
Nowhere in Antarctica is survival easy.

180
00:30:09,558 --> 00:30:13,270
Gentoo penguins
travel up to 50 miles every day

181
00:30:13,396 --> 00:30:15,815
to find food,

182
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:18,067
and they're now returning to their chicks.

183
00:30:20,528 --> 00:30:23,531
They are the fastest penguin in the sea

184
00:30:23,656 --> 00:30:26,033
and can swim at 22 mph.

185
00:30:29,495 --> 00:30:32,915
But other animals can swim much faster.

186
00:30:42,842 --> 00:30:44,301
Orca.

187
00:30:58,274 --> 00:31:01,986
This penguin must rely on its agility.

188
00:32:27,113 --> 00:32:29,990
With four orcas chasing it,

189
00:32:30,116 --> 00:32:32,493
the penguin stood little chance.

190
00:33:01,397 --> 00:33:06,235
Most gentoo parents
do make it back to the colony.

191
00:33:09,947 --> 00:33:13,492
Today, it's been a good hunt for krill.

192
00:33:16,704 --> 00:33:19,456
Perhaps too good.

193
00:33:22,209 --> 00:33:27,673
The chicks grow, and it seems that
the mohawk style is back in fashion.

194
00:33:30,968 --> 00:33:32,761
It's just a phase.

195
00:33:32,887 --> 00:33:34,430
He'll grow out of it.

196
00:33:37,266 --> 00:33:40,728
He'll soon lose
these remaining down feathers

197
00:33:40,853 --> 00:33:44,356
and be ready to leave the colony
and collect food for himself.

198
00:33:46,609 --> 00:33:49,570
But doing so is becoming harder

199
00:33:49,695 --> 00:33:52,281
because of climate change.

200
00:33:58,787 --> 00:34:01,999
Glaciers in the region
are now calving faster

201
00:34:02,124 --> 00:34:05,127
than they have done since records began.

202
00:34:12,927 --> 00:34:16,513
And this brash ice now fills the bays.

203
00:34:27,942 --> 00:34:29,318
It's autumn.

204
00:34:31,904 --> 00:34:36,825
The chicks have lost their down feathers
and they're hungry.

205
00:34:38,244 --> 00:34:40,871
They must go to sea for the first time.

206
00:34:45,251 --> 00:34:49,755
But there's now a risk of being crushed
between blocks of ice.

207
00:34:55,803 --> 00:34:58,639
They have to get
to the distant icebergs...

208
00:35:02,351 --> 00:35:06,272
...and so reach the open ocean
that lies beyond.

209
00:35:09,608 --> 00:35:12,027
And that is easier said than done.

210
00:35:22,413 --> 00:35:23,747
A leopard seal.

211
00:35:26,417 --> 00:35:28,085
Their main predator.

212
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:32,589
It's a giant - three metres long.

213
00:35:35,384 --> 00:35:39,263
These icy conditions help it to hunt.

214
00:35:47,438 --> 00:35:52,609
The penguins can neither walk nor swim.

215
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:05,497
They have no way of telling
where the seal will strike.

216
00:36:44,828 --> 00:36:47,247
These are easy pickings.

217
00:36:59,593 --> 00:37:02,805
For some, it's time to retreat.

218
00:37:40,509 --> 00:37:43,387
But now it's back to square one.

219
00:37:48,934 --> 00:37:53,689
There's no alternative
but to run the gauntlet once again.

220
00:38:28,223 --> 00:38:32,311
The seal seems to be toying
with this penguin.

221
00:38:36,106 --> 00:38:39,109
But safety is in sight.

222
00:38:56,251 --> 00:39:00,297
The ice floe is near the open ocean...

223
00:39:03,258 --> 00:39:05,969
...but this penguin is exhausted.

224
00:39:47,469 --> 00:39:50,097
Perhaps it's not worth it, after all.

225
00:40:17,416 --> 00:40:19,793
Winter is coming.

226
00:40:24,089 --> 00:40:28,677
Antarctica now undergoes
a major transformation.

227
00:40:31,221 --> 00:40:36,602
Every day, 40,000 more square miles
of sea freeze over.

228
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:43,317
By the end of winter,
the continent has doubled in size.

229
00:40:46,028 --> 00:40:50,157
This is by far
the largest desert in the world.

230
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:13,639
But the frozen surface of the sea
hides a great secret.

231
00:41:22,189 --> 00:41:24,566
It may be hostile above the ice,

232
00:41:24,691 --> 00:41:28,111
but below it, conditions are so stable

233
00:41:28,236 --> 00:41:33,367
that life over millennia
has had time to diversify.

234
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:41,416
Creatures here grow to a great size.

235
00:41:41,541 --> 00:41:45,295
Predatory nemertine worms
are three metres long.

236
00:41:49,466 --> 00:41:53,553
These dramas only become visible
when speeded up.

237
00:41:58,475 --> 00:42:01,603
We're only just beginning to discover
the details

238
00:42:01,728 --> 00:42:04,773
of the lives of such strange creatures.

239
00:42:10,570 --> 00:42:13,281
Nudibranchs are hermaphrodites.

240
00:42:16,702 --> 00:42:21,456
Each individual possesses
both male and female reproductive organs,

241
00:42:21,581 --> 00:42:27,754
so to mate, one nudibranch
just needs to find another nudibranch,

242
00:42:27,879 --> 00:42:30,340
and anyone will do.

243
00:42:32,134 --> 00:42:34,594
But nonetheless, this is a challenge

244
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:37,264
when their tiny eyes can barely see.

245
00:42:50,569 --> 00:42:53,613
Some do get lucky.

246
00:43:01,455 --> 00:43:04,458
They're fertilising each other,

247
00:43:04,583 --> 00:43:07,210
and both will produce young.

248
00:43:13,592 --> 00:43:16,887
When it's hard to find a partner,

249
00:43:17,012 --> 00:43:20,515
it pays not to have to worry
about your gender.

250
00:43:31,401 --> 00:43:35,405
Sea anemones may look like plants,
but actually are animals,

251
00:43:35,530 --> 00:43:42,162
and feed by catching edible particles that
drift within reach of their tentacles.

252
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:47,876
But being rooted to the sea floor

253
00:43:48,001 --> 00:43:51,171
makes them vulnerable to predators.

254
00:43:54,382 --> 00:43:59,805
An ocean-going jellyfish, a metre
or so across, searching for food.

255
00:44:14,694 --> 00:44:16,863
The jellyfish senses prey.

256
00:44:39,302 --> 00:44:43,473
But it's the sea anemones
that have made the catch,

257
00:44:43,598 --> 00:44:46,434
and they've grabbed a monster.

258
00:44:58,905 --> 00:45:02,659
A rare feast
for these stationary predators.

259
00:45:07,998 --> 00:45:12,752
They devour their catch
over the next four days.

260
00:45:25,849 --> 00:45:30,645
Life here under the ice
has remained unchanged for millennia.

261
00:45:32,314 --> 00:45:34,399
But in the last 200 years

262
00:45:34,524 --> 00:45:39,988
much of Antarctica's wildlife
has had to face new predators.

263
00:45:44,242 --> 00:45:46,202
Human beings.

264
00:45:49,164 --> 00:45:53,293
We devised new hunting techniques
and used them so mercilessly

265
00:45:53,418 --> 00:45:57,255
that we almost exterminated
the great whales.

266
00:46:00,467 --> 00:46:06,181
These whaling stations on South Georgia
were at the centre of this industry.

267
00:46:17,442 --> 00:46:23,823
More than one and a half million whales
were slaughtered in Antarctic waters.

268
00:46:27,410 --> 00:46:30,747
The blubber was stripped
from their massive bodies

269
00:46:30,872 --> 00:46:36,211
and boiled down in vats
to make margarine and soap.

270
00:46:38,838 --> 00:46:43,176
And the largest animal ever recorded -

271
00:46:43,301 --> 00:46:48,431
a 33-metre blue whale,
perhaps over 100 years old -

272
00:46:48,556 --> 00:46:53,478
was butchered on this ramp
in just two hours.

273
00:47:02,153 --> 00:47:06,199
This reckless slaughter marked a new low

274
00:47:06,324 --> 00:47:09,577
in our relationship
with the natural world.

275
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:44,112
Southern right whales
were hit the hardest.

276
00:47:47,782 --> 00:47:50,618
They were so trusting and inquisitive

277
00:47:50,744 --> 00:47:54,873
that they swam right up
to the whalers' boats.

278
00:47:56,708 --> 00:48:00,587
And the whalers called them right whales

279
00:48:00,712 --> 00:48:04,758
because they were
the right whales to hunt.

280
00:48:13,683 --> 00:48:17,812
Mothers with calves
were targeted first.

281
00:48:19,981 --> 00:48:25,111
To give birth, females came
to the same sheltered bays

282
00:48:25,236 --> 00:48:29,032
and would not leave their calves
alone at the surface.

283
00:48:30,909 --> 00:48:32,744
In just decades,

284
00:48:32,869 --> 00:48:37,874
a population of 35,000 was so reduced

285
00:48:37,999 --> 00:48:41,419
that only 35 of the females survived.

286
00:48:45,924 --> 00:48:48,343
But times have changed.

287
00:48:48,468 --> 00:48:54,349
A ban on the commercial hunting
of whales introduced in 1986

288
00:48:54,474 --> 00:48:59,395
has stopped all but Japan,
Norway and Iceland.

289
00:49:03,942 --> 00:49:09,656
Our relationship to these remarkable
creatures has undergone a huge shift.

290
00:49:12,158 --> 00:49:16,746
Scientists are now learning
a great deal about these whales...

291
00:49:21,084 --> 00:49:23,753
...but we still don't know
how long they live.

292
00:49:28,258 --> 00:49:31,803
It's thought
that some individuals alive today

293
00:49:31,928 --> 00:49:35,265
were around
at the time of the mass slaughter...

294
00:49:36,850 --> 00:49:42,772
...yet these 60-tonne whales remain
gentle and inquisitive around humans.

295
00:49:51,489 --> 00:49:54,576
By putting a stop
to commercial hunting,

296
00:49:54,701 --> 00:49:59,497
this population of whales
has now grown to over 2,000.

297
00:50:23,605 --> 00:50:25,940
The recovery of life in Antarctic waters

298
00:50:26,065 --> 00:50:32,238
may have a significance that extends
far beyond the reaches of the continent

299
00:50:32,363 --> 00:50:35,325
and will affect us all.

300
00:50:38,995 --> 00:50:42,582
Just off the coast of Elephant Island,

301
00:50:42,707 --> 00:50:49,214
we have recently witnessed what might be
the greatest feeding spectacle on Earth.

302
00:50:53,468 --> 00:50:55,470
On the horizon,

303
00:50:55,595 --> 00:51:01,351
over 150 whales have gathered
to feast on krill.

304
00:51:10,193 --> 00:51:15,490
This is the largest congregation
of great whales ever filmed.

305
00:51:28,711 --> 00:51:33,800
These are mostly fin whales,
up to 26 metres long.

306
00:51:35,885 --> 00:51:39,806
Humpback whales are dwarfed
in comparison.

307
00:51:43,268 --> 00:51:47,105
Thousands of animals
from all over Antarctic waters

308
00:51:47,230 --> 00:51:49,399
are making their way here.

309
00:52:02,537 --> 00:52:07,709
These seas are once again
beginning to brim with life.

310
00:52:11,296 --> 00:52:15,508
And scientists have discovered
that the Southern Ocean,

311
00:52:15,633 --> 00:52:18,052
and the life within it,

312
00:52:18,177 --> 00:52:21,681
soaks up more than twice as much
carbon from the atmosphere

313
00:52:21,806 --> 00:52:24,642
as the Amazon rainforest.

314
00:52:34,193 --> 00:52:36,446
By protecting Antarctica,

315
00:52:36,571 --> 00:52:40,199
we don't just protect the life here,

316
00:52:40,325 --> 00:52:46,581
we are helping to restore
the natural balance of the entire planet.

317
00:53:02,638 --> 00:53:04,640
Next time...

318
00:53:04,766 --> 00:53:08,144
...the largest continent on Earth.

319
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:13,358
A world of extremes...

320
00:53:13,483 --> 00:53:17,362
...where rarely seen animals
roam the land.

321
00:53:24,786 --> 00:53:26,245
Asia.
