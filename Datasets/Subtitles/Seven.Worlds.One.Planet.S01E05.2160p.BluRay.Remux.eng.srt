1
00:00:35,912 --> 00:00:38,372
Europe.

2
00:00:38,497 --> 00:00:43,252
Home to 850 million people.

3
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:53,804
This is a continent
that has been transformed by humanity.

4
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,645
It is a crowded world.

5
00:01:07,902 --> 00:01:10,488
But not all of it.

6
00:01:12,281 --> 00:01:17,453
There are still precious areas
of wilderness

7
00:01:17,578 --> 00:01:22,166
and, living within them,
some very surprising animals.

8
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:46,274
Forest once covered 80% of Europe.

9
00:01:50,361 --> 00:01:53,823
Now only half of it remains.

10
00:02:16,095 --> 00:02:17,638
A brown bear.

11
00:02:22,226 --> 00:02:28,774
One of only 1,500 that are left
in Finland's forests.

12
00:02:37,825 --> 00:02:42,621
Her cubs have recently emerged
from their nursery den.

13
00:02:48,085 --> 00:02:53,507
The long summer days
means there's plenty of time for play.

14
00:03:15,946 --> 00:03:19,283
With two boisterous cubs...

15
00:03:20,826 --> 00:03:25,581
...it pays to rest whenever you can.

16
00:03:29,085 --> 00:03:32,797
But their mother must be on her guard.

17
00:03:38,928 --> 00:03:41,555
The cubs have spotted something.

18
00:03:46,185 --> 00:03:49,688
A large male... looking for a mate.

19
00:03:57,488 --> 00:03:59,657
The cubs aren't his.

20
00:04:02,034 --> 00:04:04,745
So he might try to kill them.

21
00:04:07,665 --> 00:04:09,667
Bear cubs are excellent climbers.

22
00:04:12,002 --> 00:04:15,965
And now they're beyond his reach,
15 metres up.

23
00:04:19,635 --> 00:04:23,681
Their mother warns him
to keep his distance.

24
00:04:28,477 --> 00:04:31,647
But the cubs are coming down too soon.

25
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:44,410
She can't take any chances.

26
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:03,971
That was a close call.

27
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:26,535
Finland's forests give us a glimpse
of what Europe was once like.

28
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:34,502
A land of endless wilderness,
where large animals roamed far and wide.

29
00:05:43,093 --> 00:05:47,681
In the north, the continent extends
beyond the Arctic Circle.

30
00:06:03,072 --> 00:06:07,493
Here, the skies are illuminated
by the aurora borealis,

31
00:06:07,618 --> 00:06:10,037
the northern lights.

32
00:06:15,209 --> 00:06:17,086
Trillions of charged particles,

33
00:06:17,211 --> 00:06:20,047
ejected by electric storms on the sun,

34
00:06:20,172 --> 00:06:22,299
react with the Earth's atmosphere

35
00:06:22,424 --> 00:06:25,803
to create
this surreal nocturnal spectacle.

36
00:06:30,641 --> 00:06:35,229
But by day, this is a barren land.

37
00:06:45,948 --> 00:06:48,951
The Dovrefjell mountains of Norway.

38
00:06:54,206 --> 00:06:57,418
One of the last refuges
for an animal that once lived

39
00:06:57,543 --> 00:07:00,588
all across northern Europe.

40
00:07:09,638 --> 00:07:11,056
The musk ox.

41
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:34,413
This bull is in his prime.

42
00:07:36,332 --> 00:07:41,211
He protects the herd
and fathers all the calves.

43
00:07:45,299 --> 00:07:47,801
H is is a greatly sought-after rank...

44
00:07:52,598 --> 00:07:55,684
...and that means that,
in the mating season,

45
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:58,646
he has to deal with rivals.

46
00:08:08,489 --> 00:08:11,200
And here is one.

47
00:08:27,132 --> 00:08:34,056
Raking the ground is a warning
to other males to keep away.

48
00:08:36,392 --> 00:08:39,019
But some ignore it.

49
00:08:44,608 --> 00:08:49,405
He now has no choice
but to defend his crown.

50
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:04,795
The challenger attacks.

51
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:27,818
Each male weighs nearly half a tonne.

52
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:46,879
These clashes are usually short
and intense,

53
00:09:47,004 --> 00:09:49,506
but not this time.

54
00:09:55,345 --> 00:09:59,892
As his family looks on, neither gives in.

55
00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:06,356
The bull will need to draw
on all his experience.

56
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:23,165
But he's beginning to lose ground.

57
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:41,725
Now he's broadsided.

58
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:45,687
If he's defeated,
he will lose all his females.

59
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:55,614
With one final effort,

60
00:10:55,739 --> 00:10:59,701
the bull pushes the challenger
back up the hill.

61
00:11:12,506 --> 00:11:13,757
It's over.

62
00:11:17,761 --> 00:11:22,891
The old bull successfully defended
his rights as head of the family.

63
00:11:30,566 --> 00:11:35,988
And the challenger has to return
to a lonely life for another year.

64
00:11:42,828 --> 00:11:48,667
One of Europe's last remaining areas
of wilderness lies at its heart.

65
00:11:50,085 --> 00:11:56,758
A mountain range spanning
750 miles across eight countries.

66
00:11:56,884 --> 00:11:58,886
The Alps.

67
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:13,233
Europe's mountain ranges
may be inhospitable,

68
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:18,030
but wildlife has shared this terrain
with people for centuries.

69
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:29,958
It's dusk in the mountain villages
of Abruzzo, in central Italy.

70
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:39,551
And deep in the surrounding woods,

71
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:46,767
thermal-imaging cameras reveal
the continent's most elusive predators.

72
00:13:00,364 --> 00:13:01,865
Wolves.

73
00:13:04,201 --> 00:13:06,995
Right on the edge of the village.

74
00:13:17,422 --> 00:13:21,426
It's midwinter,
and food is hard to come by.

75
00:13:23,387 --> 00:13:26,640
This pack may not have fed for a week.

76
00:13:34,022 --> 00:13:36,900
They can travel many miles in a night,

77
00:13:37,025 --> 00:13:39,111
searching for prey.

78
00:14:01,633 --> 00:14:03,010
Red deer.

79
00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:09,182
It's pitch-black.

80
00:14:12,269 --> 00:14:15,605
Perfect conditions for an ambush.

81
00:14:18,984 --> 00:14:20,360
But even so...

82
00:14:21,611 --> 00:14:24,990
...the odds are stacked
against the wolves.

83
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,711
One wrong footstep,

84
00:14:37,836 --> 00:14:41,173
and they have lost
the advantage of surprise.

85
00:14:57,814 --> 00:15:03,445
The deer scatter
right across the mountainside.

86
00:15:15,082 --> 00:15:16,917
And to make matters worse,

87
00:15:17,042 --> 00:15:19,628
the hunt is interrupted.

88
00:15:29,221 --> 00:15:32,307
The deer are now high up the mountain.

89
00:15:35,685 --> 00:15:42,442
But the wolves use the road
to travel faster and in silence.

90
00:15:59,126 --> 00:16:02,212
They manage to get above the herd.

91
00:16:14,099 --> 00:16:17,644
Now they make their move.

92
00:16:35,036 --> 00:16:37,831
The pack needs to single out one animal.

93
00:16:52,262 --> 00:16:55,974
A wolf is more nimble in thick woodland,

94
00:16:56,099 --> 00:16:59,603
but a deer can run faster on open ground.

95
00:17:06,401 --> 00:17:09,905
Once they're close,
the pack drive the deer

96
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:11,531
straight down the mountain.

97
00:17:15,285 --> 00:17:17,954
And now it's more likely to stumble.

98
00:17:28,673 --> 00:17:31,885
In this case, the icy road proves fatal.

99
00:17:39,226 --> 00:17:44,272
But the commotion has attracted sheepdogs
from the nearby village.

100
00:17:47,192 --> 00:17:52,364
They have been bred to protect livestock
by chasing away wolves.

101
00:18:09,339 --> 00:18:11,132
With the kill lost to the sheepdogs,

102
00:18:11,258 --> 00:18:14,719
the wolves will go hungry

103
00:18:14,844 --> 00:18:17,555
for yet another night.

104
00:18:37,158 --> 00:18:43,081
Today, much of Europe's wildlife
has to live alongside people.

105
00:18:47,669 --> 00:18:52,007
The most adaptable can be found
in our towns and cities.

106
00:18:58,722 --> 00:19:04,394
Gibraltar, right on the southern tip
of the continent.

107
00:19:06,896 --> 00:19:10,108
Home to Europe's only monkeys.

108
00:19:15,447 --> 00:19:17,240
Barbary macaques.

109
00:19:30,962 --> 00:19:34,549
Four family troops live here.

110
00:19:53,818 --> 00:19:55,403
In macaque society,

111
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:58,490
there is a strict hierarchy,

112
00:19:58,615 --> 00:20:02,494
and status within it is inherited.

113
00:20:04,954 --> 00:20:09,542
This female has just given birth
to her first baby.

114
00:20:11,336 --> 00:20:15,256
She is at the bottom of the pecking order.

115
00:20:16,758 --> 00:20:19,386
So her son is, too.

116
00:20:35,443 --> 00:20:38,113
They're bullied constantly...

117
00:20:45,078 --> 00:20:48,873
...and forced to live
on the fringes of the troop.

118
00:20:55,004 --> 00:21:00,009
As outcasts,
their only comfort is each other.

119
00:21:10,228 --> 00:21:11,938
He's been snatched,

120
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:15,817
stolen by a higher-ranking female.

121
00:21:22,198 --> 00:21:26,995
She is childless,
and she wants a baby of her own.

122
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:33,751
He's only a few metres away...

123
00:21:33,877 --> 00:21:36,671
...but if his mother approaches,

124
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:39,924
the rest of the troop
could well attack her.

125
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:52,228
The kidnapper
has never raised a baby before,

126
00:21:52,353 --> 00:21:55,940
so this one is in danger.

127
00:22:04,115 --> 00:22:08,244
They're headed
towards a cable car tower.

128
00:22:09,871 --> 00:22:13,666
The young mother can't let them
out of her sight.

129
00:22:52,789 --> 00:22:54,499
They're 30 metres up.

130
00:22:55,625 --> 00:23:00,088
If she tries to grab her baby and fails,

131
00:23:00,213 --> 00:23:02,090
he could fall to his death.

132
00:23:17,689 --> 00:23:21,025
The kidnapper refuses
to surrender him.

133
00:23:22,819 --> 00:23:25,238
There's one last thing a mother can try,

134
00:23:25,363 --> 00:23:26,864
and to do it

135
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:31,244
she needs to recruit another macaque.

136
00:23:47,635 --> 00:23:51,431
Now the mother begins to groom
her companion

137
00:23:51,556 --> 00:23:54,058
in full view of the kidnapper.

138
00:23:57,604 --> 00:24:00,523
All monkeys love to be groomed,

139
00:24:00,648 --> 00:24:03,610
even by a low-ranking female.

140
00:24:04,861 --> 00:24:08,489
It's the basis for peace
in macaque society.

141
00:24:24,547 --> 00:24:29,469
Eventually, the urge to join in
is just too strong.

142
00:24:36,017 --> 00:24:38,478
The kidnap is over.

143
00:24:40,647 --> 00:24:45,735
And the youngster can climb back into
his mother's arms.

144
00:25:05,338 --> 00:25:10,009
There are pockets of wilderness
even in Europe's cities.

145
00:25:12,303 --> 00:25:16,307
Green oases among the urban sprawl.

146
00:25:20,603 --> 00:25:26,734
Vienna, in Austria, has over 2,000 parks,
gardens and cemeteries.

147
00:25:36,327 --> 00:25:42,750
And down in the undergrowth,
a rather unusual resident.

148
00:25:52,969 --> 00:25:56,013
A European hamster.

149
00:26:05,231 --> 00:26:10,194
Wild hamsters are found in grasslands
throughout central Europe.

150
00:26:11,946 --> 00:26:15,533
Here, in the city,
they're doing extremely well.

151
00:26:17,785 --> 00:26:21,956
This male is on a mission to find food,

152
00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:26,419
and he's set his sights
on one thing in particular.

153
00:26:28,421 --> 00:26:30,047
Fresh flowers.

154
00:26:36,179 --> 00:26:41,684
To survive the winter,
hamsters must fatten up.

155
00:26:41,809 --> 00:26:44,437
So there's no time to waste.

156
00:27:00,161 --> 00:27:06,125
The only problem - these flowers
are in someone else's patch.

157
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:42,537
Graveside bouquets are worth fighting for.

158
00:27:47,834 --> 00:27:53,297
The winner gets to keep the territory
and all the food within it.

159
00:28:04,934 --> 00:28:09,063
The loser has to beat a hasty retreat.

160
00:28:18,447 --> 00:28:22,910
But the lure of fresh petals
is just too much.

161
00:28:25,663 --> 00:28:26,706
Plan B.

162
00:28:26,831 --> 00:28:29,000
Stealth mode.

163
00:28:41,596 --> 00:28:43,514
The coast looks clear.

164
00:28:47,768 --> 00:28:51,188
But best not take any chances.

165
00:29:06,162 --> 00:29:10,875
The trick is to get in and out
before you're caught.

166
00:29:16,797 --> 00:29:21,385
And now... dessert.

167
00:29:24,347 --> 00:29:29,769
Candle wax -
it's full of oil and high in calories.

168
00:29:49,789 --> 00:29:54,502
A hamster's cheeks can hold
a quarter of its body weight.

169
00:30:03,302 --> 00:30:05,930
Just one more mouthful.

170
00:30:15,856 --> 00:30:17,066
Oh, dear.

171
00:30:24,991 --> 00:30:28,494
Big cheeks and narrow bottlenecks -

172
00:30:28,619 --> 00:30:31,497
how very embarrassing.

173
00:30:42,758 --> 00:30:44,969
Mission accomplished.

174
00:30:52,893 --> 00:30:56,689
Europe's landscape
has changed dramatically...

175
00:30:58,357 --> 00:31:02,361
...but its temperate climate
is still good for wildlife.

176
00:31:04,572 --> 00:31:06,907
The continent has warm summers...

177
00:31:09,952 --> 00:31:11,954
...and mild winters.

178
00:31:16,333 --> 00:31:21,213
These conditions are a consequence
of its position on the globe...

179
00:31:23,466 --> 00:31:29,930
...and the influence of the Gulf Stream.

180
00:31:30,056 --> 00:31:34,477
This current of warm water
in the Atlantic Ocean heats the air

181
00:31:34,602 --> 00:31:37,813
that then flows over the land.

182
00:31:48,824 --> 00:31:52,078
And every year, Europe's unique climate

183
00:31:52,203 --> 00:31:56,415
helps trigger an extraordinary
natural event.

184
00:32:02,713 --> 00:32:05,132
The Tisza River, in Hungary.

185
00:32:08,427 --> 00:32:10,846
For a few days in June,

186
00:32:10,971 --> 00:32:14,183
when day length
and water temperature are just right...

187
00:32:16,018 --> 00:32:18,813
...the largest of all mayflies emerge.

188
00:32:23,776 --> 00:32:27,696
After three years of feeding
and growing on the riverbed,

189
00:32:27,822 --> 00:32:31,117
the males appear first.

190
00:32:39,792 --> 00:32:42,837
With new wings,
they can fly to the riverbank

191
00:32:42,962 --> 00:32:46,298
and there undergo a final moult.

192
00:33:11,323 --> 00:33:14,076
Now sexually mature,

193
00:33:14,201 --> 00:33:16,787
they have just one purpose in life -

194
00:33:16,912 --> 00:33:19,623
to find a female.

195
00:33:28,549 --> 00:33:31,719
Each male has only three hours to live.

196
00:33:35,806 --> 00:33:40,269
And now the females begin to emerge
on the surface of the river.

197
00:33:43,564 --> 00:33:47,610
The males scour the water surface,
searching for them...

198
00:33:53,949 --> 00:33:57,786
...each desperate to be the one
that fertilises her eggs.

199
00:34:00,915 --> 00:34:04,501
Every female is pounced on
as soon as she appears.

200
00:34:16,805 --> 00:34:19,683
With only minutes left
for each male to live,

201
00:34:19,808 --> 00:34:23,437
the competition becomes
increasingly urgent.

202
00:34:30,945 --> 00:34:34,198
And all too soon, the males' time is up.

203
00:34:42,206 --> 00:34:44,583
All of them die.

204
00:34:56,762 --> 00:35:00,975
But the females' journey
has only just begun.

205
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:16,490
Now that they've mated,

206
00:35:16,615 --> 00:35:18,617
they start to fly upstream

207
00:35:18,742 --> 00:35:22,746
and continue for as much as three miles.

208
00:35:45,561 --> 00:35:47,438
At the height of the hatch,

209
00:35:47,563 --> 00:35:51,567
there may be as many
as ten million insects on the wing.

210
00:36:06,582 --> 00:36:08,334
Exhausted,

211
00:36:08,459 --> 00:36:13,922
the females now collapse
and rain down onto the water's surface.

212
00:36:17,343 --> 00:36:21,221
And as they hit it,
each releases thousands of eggs.

213
00:36:36,487 --> 00:36:39,156
As the eggs slowly sink,

214
00:36:39,281 --> 00:36:41,116
they drift downstream,

215
00:36:41,241 --> 00:36:44,286
so that by the time
each reaches the riverbed,

216
00:36:44,411 --> 00:36:49,666
it will be in exactly the same spot
that its parents emerged.

217
00:36:55,422 --> 00:36:58,926
Just hours
after the first mayflies appeared,

218
00:36:59,051 --> 00:37:03,931
this great eruption of life is over.

219
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:14,691
Europe's extensive waterways
are a haven for wildlife.

220
00:37:16,485 --> 00:37:19,196
One of the richest of its wetlands

221
00:37:19,321 --> 00:37:24,243
lies on the edge of the Black Sea,
in Romania.

222
00:37:25,285 --> 00:37:28,455
The delta of the Danube River.

223
00:37:31,834 --> 00:37:36,046
Migrating birds are drawn here
from as far away as central Africa

224
00:37:36,171 --> 00:37:37,965
and Asia.

225
00:37:49,768 --> 00:37:52,020
Great white pelicans.

226
00:37:58,026 --> 00:38:02,072
Every summer, three-quarters
of the world's population

227
00:38:02,197 --> 00:38:03,949
flock to the delta.

228
00:38:10,372 --> 00:38:14,418
They've flown thousands of miles
to get here,

229
00:38:14,543 --> 00:38:19,631
and they will spend the summer
feasting on the delta's riches.

230
00:38:46,492 --> 00:38:49,203
To find the best fishing,

231
00:38:49,286 --> 00:38:51,413
they take to the air.

232
00:39:11,642 --> 00:39:13,435
From half a mile up,

233
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:15,646
they search the entire delta,

234
00:39:15,771 --> 00:39:17,648
200 miles across.

235
00:39:32,371 --> 00:39:35,415
They can't see individual fish
from this height,

236
00:39:35,541 --> 00:39:40,671
so instead they look for others below
that have already done so.

237
00:39:44,633 --> 00:39:46,552
Cormorants.

238
00:39:49,096 --> 00:39:52,933
They are diving deep
to reach the biggest shoals,

239
00:39:53,058 --> 00:39:56,228
flushing them to the surface.

240
00:40:04,778 --> 00:40:07,030
A couple of pelicans land...

241
00:40:10,033 --> 00:40:14,079
...and others soon home in on them.

242
00:40:32,014 --> 00:40:35,767
The pelicans don't join the feast
directly.

243
00:40:40,439 --> 00:40:42,816
They mug the diners.

244
00:41:02,836 --> 00:41:08,717
This brutal tactic enables each pelican
to catch many more fish

245
00:41:08,842 --> 00:41:12,387
more quickly than it would do
if it worked by itself.

246
00:41:37,746 --> 00:41:41,416
Once the shoals of fish
have been plundered and dispersed,

247
00:41:41,541 --> 00:41:44,294
the cormorants make their escape.

248
00:41:47,756 --> 00:41:53,011
And the pelican pirates fly off
in search of their next meal.

249
00:42:01,144 --> 00:42:05,691
Water has shaped Europe's landscape
in another way.

250
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:16,702
There is a vast wilderness lying
within the rocks of the continent.

251
00:42:24,418 --> 00:42:26,002
Caves.

252
00:42:32,676 --> 00:42:39,349
Over 12,000 have been discovered
in Slovenia's Karst region alone.

253
00:42:41,101 --> 00:42:45,188
Each has been eroded by water
over millions of years...

254
00:42:46,815 --> 00:42:50,986
...and shaped drip... by drip.

255
00:42:58,535 --> 00:43:01,872
The largest cavern is over 15 miles long,

256
00:43:01,997 --> 00:43:06,334
and there are certainly many more
still to be discovered.

257
00:43:19,806 --> 00:43:25,604
Down here live some of the most
specialised animals on the planet.

258
00:43:30,192 --> 00:43:35,614
New species of them are discovered
in Europe's caves every year.

259
00:43:44,122 --> 00:43:48,335
This is a world
that still holds many secrets.

260
00:43:56,676 --> 00:43:59,012
In the deepest pools

261
00:43:59,137 --> 00:44:03,892
lurk animals that were once believed
to be baby dragons.

262
00:44:25,664 --> 00:44:29,626
They have feathery gills
which enable them to breathe underwater,

263
00:44:29,751 --> 00:44:31,628
as well as on land.

264
00:44:36,091 --> 00:44:38,468
They are olms.

265
00:44:44,599 --> 00:44:47,644
They're completely blind,

266
00:44:47,769 --> 00:44:51,690
but sensory pits around the mouth
enable them to detect

267
00:44:51,815 --> 00:44:55,861
the faint electrical currents
emitted by their prey.

268
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:02,534
Food of any kind down here
is hard to come by.

269
00:45:04,202 --> 00:45:08,331
But an olm can go without a meal
for a decade...

270
00:45:08,456 --> 00:45:11,293
...and live for a century.

271
00:45:21,261 --> 00:45:26,391
The olms' world has remained
virtually unchanged for millennia.

272
00:45:28,268 --> 00:45:34,232
Above, however,
Europe has altered beyond recognition.

273
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:45,619
Its landscape has been transformed
by humans.

274
00:45:47,787 --> 00:45:53,710
Protected wilderness now covers
less than 4% of its surface.

275
00:45:56,212 --> 00:46:00,634
The disappearance of wilderness
has had catastrophic consequences

276
00:46:00,717 --> 00:46:03,219
for wildlife.

277
00:46:08,475 --> 00:46:13,313
One-fifth of Europe's animals
are now under threat.

278
00:46:21,571 --> 00:46:24,950
Some teeter right on the brink
of extinction.

279
00:46:29,871 --> 00:46:32,290
The Iberian lynx.

280
00:46:35,251 --> 00:46:39,297
One of the world's most endangered cats.

281
00:46:43,301 --> 00:46:45,345
In less than two decades,

282
00:46:45,470 --> 00:46:49,599
the lynx population decreased
by nearly 90%.

283
00:46:54,062 --> 00:46:59,109
At one point,
there were fewer than 100 individuals.

284
00:47:15,834 --> 00:47:17,877
Today, their last stronghold

285
00:47:18,003 --> 00:47:23,675
is in the mountains of
the Sierra de Andujar, in southern Spain.

286
00:47:26,052 --> 00:47:31,516
Here, a natural park was created
to help protect the lynx.

287
00:47:37,647 --> 00:47:42,318
Only 25 miles across, it is small.

288
00:47:45,405 --> 00:47:49,451
But for this male, it's just enough.

289
00:48:03,882 --> 00:48:06,509
He's lived here all his life.

290
00:48:08,762 --> 00:48:15,769
At ten years old, he's reached
a remarkable age for a wild lynx.

291
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:29,407
Once persecuted, he's now protected.

292
00:48:42,170 --> 00:48:47,383
For this old male,
and Europe's entire lynx population,

293
00:48:47,509 --> 00:48:51,638
this could be the beginning
of a new chapter.

294
00:49:01,189 --> 00:49:03,066
In this year alone,

295
00:49:03,191 --> 00:49:05,735
nearly 200 kittens have been born,

296
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:10,907
and the population has risen to over 700.

297
00:49:17,789 --> 00:49:20,333
But the fate of the Iberian lynx,

298
00:49:20,458 --> 00:49:23,878
and indeed of all Europe's wildlife,

299
00:49:24,003 --> 00:49:26,548
is far from certain.

300
00:49:29,175 --> 00:49:32,846
The continent has now been so changed
by humanity

301
00:49:32,929 --> 00:49:37,350
that many of its animal species
are under threat.

302
00:49:41,354 --> 00:49:45,859
Only by protecting
the few wildernesses that remain

303
00:49:45,942 --> 00:49:49,737
and creating new wild spaces

304
00:49:49,863 --> 00:49:55,827
can we ensure a future
for Europe's precious wildlife.

305
00:50:06,588 --> 00:50:09,090
Next time...

306
00:50:09,215 --> 00:50:11,593
...a land of constant change...

307
00:50:13,511 --> 00:50:18,558
...where pioneering animals
make the most of every opportunity.

308
00:50:23,813 --> 00:50:26,149
North America.
