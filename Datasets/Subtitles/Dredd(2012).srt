1
00:00:59,017 --> 00:01:02,103
America is an irradiated wasteIand.

2
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:05,815
Within it lies a city.

3
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:10,695
Outside the boundary walls a desert.

4
00:01:10,988 --> 00:01:12,739
A cursed earth.

5
00:01:14,241 --> 00:01:17,577
lnside the walls a cursed city,

6
00:01:17,828 --> 00:01:21,164
stretching from Boston to Washington, D.C.

7
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:25,001
An unbroken concrete landscape.

8
00:01:26,754 --> 00:01:31,174
800 million people
living in the ruin of the old world

9
00:01:31,842 --> 00:01:34,510
and the mega structures of the new one.

10
00:01:36,847 --> 00:01:40,183
Mega blocks. Mega highways.

11
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,519
Mega City One.

12
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:55,364
ConvuIsing. Choking.

13
00:01:57,951 --> 00:02:00,369
Breaking under its own weight.

14
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:07,210
Citizens in fear of the street.

15
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:11,380
The gun. The gang.

16
00:02:15,761 --> 00:02:19,096
OnIy one thing
fighting for order in the chaos,

17
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:23,226
the men and women of the HaII of Justice.

18
00:02:27,523 --> 00:02:28,898
Juries.

19
00:02:31,068 --> 00:02:32,568
Executioners.

20
00:02:35,364 --> 00:02:36,405
Judges.

21
00:02:45,749 --> 00:02:50,253
Responders needed at a square at 1 1 17.
Code 10-10.

22
00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:52,380
Leisure compIex. Shots fired.

23
00:02:52,464 --> 00:02:55,466
Out of vehicIe, in pursuit.
Request aerial surveillance.

24
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:58,886
l have a control drone flagging three perps.

25
00:02:59,263 --> 00:03:02,223
Responders needed
in Sub-Sector 20, Flyover 5.

26
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:05,935
We have a positive lD on
three suspects wanted on multiple counts.

27
00:03:06,061 --> 00:03:07,603
Any Judges, please respond.

28
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:13,860
Dredd to Control.
ln pursuit of vehicle, Sector 1 3.

29
00:03:15,946 --> 00:03:19,949
Driving erratic. Suspects are
under the influence of narcotics.

30
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:47,101
Got a Judge on our taiI.

31
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:49,770
What?

32
00:03:49,897 --> 00:03:51,647
l said we got a Judge on our tail!

33
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:54,150
Take him out or we're dead fucking meat!

34
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:57,778
Fuck!

35
00:03:59,448 --> 00:04:00,781
Do you require backup?

36
00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:01,991
No.

37
00:04:05,287 --> 00:04:06,746
Fucker!

38
00:04:12,294 --> 00:04:14,754
l can't get him! Straighten the fuck out!

39
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:31,354
Be advised. We have Iost visuaI.

40
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:38,903
Fuck, he's right on us!

41
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:42,573
Man, we're dead. We're fucking dead!

42
00:04:54,211 --> 00:04:58,547
Control. Perps just wiped out an innocent.
l'm taking them down.

43
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:20,111
Bike. Activate crowd control.

44
00:05:20,237 --> 00:05:24,740
Activated. Citizens, be calm.
Step back from the crime scene.

45
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:29,870
Interference carries an automatic
five-year sentence in the iso-cubes.

46
00:05:40,132 --> 00:05:42,216
Hey, fucking get out of here!

47
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:07,033
Control. Paramedics to my GPS.
Multiple wounded and bodies for resyk.

48
00:06:07,451 --> 00:06:09,118
Copy, Dredd.

49
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:14,874
All shoppers are reminded to avoid the
IeveI one food courts untiI further notice.

50
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,961
-AIternative refreshments can be found...
-Shut the fuck up.

51
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:39,857
-Let's talk.
-Talk about what, Judge?

52
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:43,652
Release the hostage unharmed,

53
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:48,491
and l guarantee you a sentence of life
in an iso-cube without parole.

54
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:51,702
Life without parole?
That's the deal you're offering?

55
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:53,579
Only if you comply.

56
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:59,001
Your crimes include multiple homicide
and the attempted murder of a Judge.

57
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:03,047
lf you do not comply, the sentence is death.

58
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:05,424
You aren't a very good negotiator, Judge.

59
00:07:05,509 --> 00:07:07,760
You know why?
You got no fucking leverage!

60
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:12,598
Here's the deal. You let me walk
or l blow her fucking brains out. Okay?

61
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,228
Negotiation's over.

62
00:07:17,354 --> 00:07:18,771
What are you doing?

63
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:21,607
Didn't you hear what l said?
l'll kill the bitch!

64
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:23,567
Yeah, l heard you, hotshot.

65
00:07:23,652 --> 00:07:24,610
What?

66
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:26,695
l said "hotshot."

67
00:07:50,929 --> 00:07:52,930
ControI to Dredd. Come in.

68
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:56,267
-Is your pursuit resolved?
-Affirmative.

69
00:07:56,393 --> 00:08:00,479
Report back to the Hall of Justice.
The Chief Judge wants to see you.

70
00:08:03,567 --> 00:08:05,109
Thank you, Judge.

71
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:10,906
The level one food court will reopen in
30 minutes. Thank you for your patience.

72
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:28,424
Cassandra Anderson. Twenty-one.

73
00:08:29,134 --> 00:08:32,845
Born in a bIock 100 meters
from the radiation boundary wall.

74
00:08:32,971 --> 00:08:37,016
At age seven, she lost both parents
to residuaI-faIIout cancer.

75
00:08:37,142 --> 00:08:41,937
As is usual with orphans, she was given
a Judge aptitude test at age nine.

76
00:08:42,105 --> 00:08:43,939
lt classified her as unsuitable,

77
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:47,443
but she was entered into the Academy
on special instruction.

78
00:08:48,445 --> 00:08:51,322
ln the Academy, her record was never
better than borderline.

79
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:55,618
Her final Academy score
put her three percentile points below a pass.

80
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:57,953
So what's she doing in a uniform?

81
00:09:03,335 --> 00:09:05,002
-Rookie Anderson.
-Sir.

82
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:07,004
How many people are observing you?

83
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:11,634
Two.

84
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:14,803
What can you tell me
about the person l'm with?

85
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:19,433
Male. Another Judge.

86
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:26,023
I can feel anger. And control. But

87
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:29,652
there's something else.

88
00:09:29,778 --> 00:09:33,280
Something behind the controI. Something

89
00:09:34,783 --> 00:09:37,451
-almost...
-Okay, Anderson.

90
00:09:37,953 --> 00:09:39,286
That wiII do.

91
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:41,455
She's a mutant.

92
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:46,710
The Judges Council have chosen to
overlook her status. So you will, too.

93
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:51,048
She's the most powerful psychic
we've ever come across by a huge margin.

94
00:09:51,633 --> 00:09:54,051
The Judges are losing the war for the city.

95
00:09:54,177 --> 00:09:56,845
We believe she could be a major asset.

96
00:09:56,972 --> 00:10:01,350
As l said, her final score was only
three points below a pass. lt's marginal.

97
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:05,813
-lt's not marginal. She failed.
-The girl's getting one more chance.

98
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:11,527
l want you to take her out, give her one day
in the field. Supervised.

99
00:10:11,695 --> 00:10:13,737
See if she makes the grade.

100
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:17,199
Sink or swim. Chuck her in the deep end.

101
00:10:19,536 --> 00:10:21,537
lt's all the deep end.

102
00:10:23,206 --> 00:10:26,250
Personnel are required
to carry identification at all times.

103
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:29,420
A rookie Judge on assessment
is likely to be involved in armed combat.

104
00:10:29,546 --> 00:10:31,547
One in five don't survive the first day.

105
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:35,592
You may be required to carry out
on-the-spot executions of convicted felons.

106
00:10:35,677 --> 00:10:36,677
Yes, sir.

107
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:39,305
lncorrect sentencing is an automatic fail.

108
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:43,892
Disobeying a direct order from your
assessment officer is an automatic fail.

109
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:47,980
Losing your primary weapon or
having it taken from you is an automatic fail.

110
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:49,106
Yes, sir.

111
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:52,276
-Are you ready, rookie?
-l am.

112
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,069
Mandatory vehicle checks...

113
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:56,196
Your assessment starts now.

114
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:23,158
Ma.

115
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:34,670
We got trouble.

116
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:43,345
They were selling Sternhammer product
on my level.

117
00:12:43,805 --> 00:12:47,474
l warned them off with a beating a couple
of weeks ago. Guess it didn't work.

118
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,103
-You can't deal with it yourself?
-l can deal with it.

119
00:12:51,354 --> 00:12:55,023
The question is whether you
wanna make an example of them.

120
00:12:57,861 --> 00:13:00,946
Skin them. Toss them over the balcony.

121
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:03,449
Hit them with a little Slo-Mo first?

122
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:05,784
Sure.

123
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:14,543
Eat this, fucker!

124
00:13:15,003 --> 00:13:16,336
Hold him down!

125
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:19,298
Please. Please.

126
00:13:20,383 --> 00:13:21,383
Please.

127
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:07,554
Responders in the vicinity of Peach Trees.
We have a report of a triple homicide.

128
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,350
The paramedic is on site
and is cordoning off the area.

129
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:22,110
Twelve serious crimes
reported every minute.

130
00:14:22,237 --> 00:14:24,112
1 7,000 per day.

131
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:27,282
-We can respond to around 6%.
-Which 6%?

132
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:31,119
Your show, rookie. You tell me.

133
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,872
Peach Trees. Multiple homicide.

134
00:14:34,249 --> 00:14:36,625
Dredd to Control. We'll take Peach Trees.

135
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:38,210
Copy that.

136
00:15:01,568 --> 00:15:03,485
Hey, Joey, show us what you've got.

137
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:11,243
Okay, rookie.
What do you know about Peach Trees?

138
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:14,663
Sir. Peach Trees houses
75,000 registered citizens.

139
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:18,792
lt has the highest crime rate in Sector 1 3.
Unemployment rate of 96%.

140
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:23,005
And more than half the residential levels
here are classed as slums.

141
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:27,426
Rookie.

142
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,761
Judgment.

143
00:15:29,846 --> 00:15:33,181
Vagrancy, three weeks, iso-cubes.
But prioritize murders?

144
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:36,101
Correct. Don't be here when we get back.

145
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:38,020
Yes. Thanks, Judge.

146
00:15:39,856 --> 00:15:42,524
Please remain behind the security tape.

147
00:15:43,526 --> 00:15:45,527
So why do you wanna be a Judge?

148
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:49,865
Sir. l want to protect and serve the city.
To make a difference.

149
00:15:49,991 --> 00:15:52,367
Make a difference to a block like this?

150
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:54,703
lt's yours if you want it.

151
00:15:54,996 --> 00:15:59,207
l was born and raised in a block like this
before the Justice Department took me.

152
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:04,296
l know there are good people inside,
good families just trying to get by.

153
00:16:05,715 --> 00:16:08,383
Yes, l believe l can make a difference.

154
00:16:10,178 --> 00:16:11,511
Admirable.

155
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:17,142
The mall will be closing today at 10 o'clock.
Plenty of time to make your purchases.

156
00:16:19,729 --> 00:16:20,729
What have you got?

157
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:23,732
Three stiffs in a somewhat
fucked-up condition.

158
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:27,069
Did you get a picture of that?

159
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:30,322
-You based in Peach Trees?
-Med Center, level 25.

160
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:32,157
-You lD'd them?
-Mostly.

161
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:33,742
These two are registered to this block.

162
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:35,827
-And him?
-l'll have to run his blood

163
00:16:35,912 --> 00:16:37,245
through a DNA profiler.

164
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:39,915
lf l can figure out which blood is his.

165
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:48,674
What do you make of this, rookie?

166
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:51,677
l don't know, sir.

167
00:16:56,599 --> 00:16:59,184
lt's a cold-burn from a Slo-Mo inhaler.

168
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:00,602
Slo-Mo?

169
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:04,189
Only just hit the grid,
but it's making big waves.

170
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:08,110
Makes the brain feel as if
time is passing at 1 % its normal speed.

171
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:12,114
Guess it felt like a long way down.

172
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:28,463
Positive on your lDs.

173
00:17:28,631 --> 00:17:33,135
All showing convictions for possession
of narcotics. Transmitting data now.

174
00:17:34,804 --> 00:17:39,474
Small-time perps. Junkies. No known
gang affiliation. What's your analysis?

175
00:17:41,144 --> 00:17:44,062
Drugged. Skinned. Displayed in public.

176
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:48,024
l think it's a punishment killing.
Someone's trying to send a message.

177
00:17:48,151 --> 00:17:51,486
Yeah. Don't fuck with the Ma-Ma clan.

178
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:54,406
Ma-Ma clan?

179
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:00,829
We have her on record
from her whoring days.

180
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:02,873
The picture's pretty old,

181
00:18:02,999 --> 00:18:07,586
but that's her.
Madeline Madrigal, aka Ma-Ma.

182
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:11,256
Ex-hooker from the S-9 pleasure district.

183
00:18:11,382 --> 00:18:15,886
Quit working when she got sliced up
by a pimp. She got her own back.

184
00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:19,473
Block legend says she's feminized
the guy with her teeth.

185
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:23,351
Took over his business interests
and never looked back.

186
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:26,646
Anyone else,
you'd say it was bullshit, right?

187
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:30,567
Not with Ma-Ma. Her trademark is vioIence.

188
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:39,618
Not so long ago, there were three main
gangs hustling for control of Peach Trees.

189
00:18:40,161 --> 00:18:43,914
The Peyote Kings,
the Red Dragons, the Judged.

190
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,625
Then Ma-Ma arrived.

191
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:53,632
What the fuck?

192
00:18:55,426 --> 00:18:56,927
Let's go!

193
00:18:58,346 --> 00:19:02,349
Took over the top floor of the block
and started working her way down.

194
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:06,978
Nine months later,
she had control of everything.

195
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:09,523
LeveIs one to 200

196
00:19:10,191 --> 00:19:11,525
are hers.

197
00:19:12,443 --> 00:19:13,777
How did she get away with it?

198
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:17,113
You know how often
we get a Judge up in Peach Trees?

199
00:19:18,032 --> 00:19:19,991
Well, you got one now.

200
00:19:20,952 --> 00:19:24,788
The victims are registered
to apartments on level 39.

201
00:19:24,914 --> 00:19:29,459
Likely killed over a turf issue,
so perps will be in the vicinity.

202
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:31,503
Rookie.

203
00:19:32,255 --> 00:19:36,258
Find out where the clan operate
on this level, and hit it hard.

204
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:41,054
That would be here.

205
00:20:49,832 --> 00:20:52,125
l take it this is your first time
in non-sim combat.

206
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:53,668
Yes, sir.

207
00:20:53,753 --> 00:20:57,005
Been wondering when you'd remember
you left your helmet behind.

208
00:20:57,131 --> 00:21:00,467
Sir, a helmet can interfere
with my psychic abilities.

209
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:04,179
Think a bullet
might interfere with them more.

210
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:18,068
-Are you ready?
-Yes, sir.

211
00:21:19,737 --> 00:21:23,323
-You don't look ready.
-Just adrenaline, sir.

212
00:22:41,569 --> 00:22:42,652
Rookie.

213
00:22:44,238 --> 00:22:46,573
Anderson. Judgment.

214
00:22:46,866 --> 00:22:51,870
Crime, possession and use of controlled
substances. Sentence, two years iso-cubes.

215
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:55,248
No, don't tell me. Tell Control.

216
00:22:56,125 --> 00:22:58,334
-Anderson to Control.
-Copy.

217
00:22:58,461 --> 00:23:01,713
Requesting meat wagon to Peach Trees,
level 39. We have

218
00:23:02,131 --> 00:23:05,675
four bodies for resyk
and eight live for the iso-cubes.

219
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:08,428
Copy that. Meat wagon inbound.

220
00:23:08,554 --> 00:23:10,930
All right. Let's get them cuffed.

221
00:23:11,057 --> 00:23:12,057
Move. Up.

222
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:21,566
Sir, this one's a gang member. He...

223
00:23:28,491 --> 00:23:30,033
Sir, it's him.

224
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:31,785
Him who?

225
00:23:31,911 --> 00:23:34,788
The man who murdered the people
in the atrium.

226
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:37,040
You're sure?

227
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:41,419
99%.

228
00:23:44,048 --> 00:23:47,133
Can't execute a perp on 99%.

229
00:23:51,222 --> 00:23:55,391
Save me a lot of paperwork
if you just confess right now.

230
00:23:58,395 --> 00:24:04,067
We'll take him in. See how he holds up
after a few hours of interrogation.

231
00:24:30,219 --> 00:24:31,427
Shit.

232
00:24:33,222 --> 00:24:35,890
Judges. No, no, no, no.

233
00:24:38,978 --> 00:24:42,689
Caleb? There's a problem on level 39.

234
00:24:42,815 --> 00:24:45,150
Judges hit the distribution point
and shot the place up.

235
00:24:45,234 --> 00:24:46,442
Took out a few of the boys.

236
00:24:46,569 --> 00:24:48,361
So what? We're overdue a bust.

237
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:51,281
lt's just the Judges showing their faces,
reminding the citizens they exist.

238
00:24:51,365 --> 00:24:54,325
-No, Ma. They picked up Kay.
-Executed?

239
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:57,078
lnterrogation.
They're taking him in right now.

240
00:24:57,163 --> 00:24:58,204
Fuck.

241
00:24:58,372 --> 00:25:02,000
-If Kay talks...
-lf they're taking him in, he'll talk.

242
00:25:04,545 --> 00:25:06,296
What are we gonna do?

243
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:39,454
That one's still breathing.

244
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:44,334
Control room is secure.

245
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:54,177
Router's in. You're good to go.

246
00:25:56,847 --> 00:25:58,681
Sector ControI.

247
00:25:59,141 --> 00:26:01,392
Sector Control, this is Peach Trees Control,

248
00:26:01,477 --> 00:26:05,063
l just wanna check you were notified about
the def-con systems test today.

249
00:26:05,147 --> 00:26:08,900
Copy that. Peach Trees,
we don't have you down for a def-con test.

250
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:12,403
-Yeah, we must be. lf you check the...
-I've got nothing.

251
00:26:15,074 --> 00:26:16,991
God fucking damn it, Sector!

252
00:26:17,076 --> 00:26:20,411
l put in the notification
myself three fucking times!

253
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:21,788
We are good to go right now!

254
00:26:21,872 --> 00:26:24,999
l've got my supervisor
breathing down my neck.

255
00:26:25,167 --> 00:26:28,002
Hold fire, Peach Trees. Let me get on this.

256
00:26:28,379 --> 00:26:30,546
Okay. I put you on the system.

257
00:26:30,673 --> 00:26:34,509
Hall of Justice and all emergency services
are notified to ignore your status.

258
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:36,803
You can run the test any time you like.

259
00:26:36,887 --> 00:26:40,974
Appreciate that, Sector.
You just saved my ass over here.

260
00:26:41,058 --> 00:26:43,017
You're welcome, Peach Trees.

261
00:26:52,486 --> 00:26:55,697
Sir, he's thinking about
making a move for your gun.

262
00:26:55,823 --> 00:26:56,823
Yeah.

263
00:26:58,075 --> 00:27:00,159
He just changed his mind.

264
00:27:00,536 --> 00:27:01,536
Yeah.

265
00:27:06,542 --> 00:27:10,044
Then enter the pass key
and you should be inside.

266
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:14,549
Security protocoIs accessed.

267
00:27:15,843 --> 00:27:17,885
War protocol accessed.

268
00:27:19,096 --> 00:27:20,888
BIast shieId initiated.

269
00:27:26,562 --> 00:27:29,355
Warned you. Get up.
You're headed for the cubes.

270
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,733
Stand cIear of doors.

271
00:27:34,236 --> 00:27:45,121
AII residents remain caIm.

272
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:18,696
What's going on?

273
00:28:27,456 --> 00:28:29,540
Lockdown complete.

274
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:43,805
You're patched in.

275
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:01,072
Peach Trees.

276
00:29:02,074 --> 00:29:03,991
This is Ma-Ma.

277
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:09,831
Somewhere in this bIock are two Judges.

278
00:29:12,251 --> 00:29:13,918
I want them dead.

279
00:29:15,671 --> 00:29:18,673
Until I get what I want,
the bIock is Iocked down.

280
00:29:20,801 --> 00:29:25,138
All clan, every level, hunt the Judges down.

281
00:29:26,348 --> 00:29:28,182
Everyone else, clear the corridors

282
00:29:28,308 --> 00:29:30,852
and stay the fuck out of our way
until the shooting stops.

283
00:29:34,523 --> 00:29:36,315
If I hear of anyone helping the Judges,

284
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:40,194
I wiII kiII them
and the next generation of their family.

285
00:29:46,452 --> 00:29:48,327
As for the Judges...

286
00:29:48,412 --> 00:29:50,163
We better move.

287
00:29:50,247 --> 00:29:52,582
...sit tight, or run.

288
00:29:56,378 --> 00:29:58,671
Makes no difference. You're mine.

289
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:22,028
Control, we have a situation developing
in Peach Trees. Do you copy?

290
00:30:23,363 --> 00:30:26,741
-Control, do you copy?
-My comms are down, too.

291
00:30:26,909 --> 00:30:28,951
Shielding must be blocking
our transmissions.

292
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:32,079
We'll head for the Med Center.

293
00:30:36,418 --> 00:30:37,793
They're here!

294
00:30:39,421 --> 00:30:40,880
-Call it.
-Sir?

295
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:42,798
You're on assessment, rookie. Call it.

296
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:46,552
Multiple armed targets.
Obstructed line of sight. Gas grenades.

297
00:30:46,637 --> 00:30:47,970
Respirators.

298
00:30:48,722 --> 00:30:51,098
Advise you hold your breath.

299
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:53,494
l want the north and east corridor
totally covered.

300
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:57,665
Sal's got the west and the south.
And spread out your hardware.

301
00:31:57,833 --> 00:32:00,835
We're gonna hand these Judges
back to Ma-Ma on a plate.

302
00:32:05,215 --> 00:32:08,968
-Stay fucking focused.
-Judges got it coming!

303
00:32:21,023 --> 00:32:24,692
-Judge, come and get me.
-We're gonna have to go through them.

304
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:27,695
Stun grenade.

305
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:35,953
-Kill that motherfucker.
-Let's give them the good news.

306
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:44,420
-Man up that corridor, man.
-Fuck up the Judges.

307
00:32:44,546 --> 00:32:45,880
Fuck them.

308
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:49,717
Citizens of Peach Trees. This is the law.

309
00:32:49,885 --> 00:32:51,719
Who do you think you are
coming up in here?

310
00:32:52,137 --> 00:32:56,557
Disperse immediately,
or we will use lethal force to clear the area.

311
00:32:56,642 --> 00:33:00,394
-Where's that coming from?
-Over there. Access corridor.

312
00:33:00,562 --> 00:33:02,563
You have been warned.

313
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:06,942
You now have 20 seconds to comply.

314
00:33:07,069 --> 00:33:11,739
lt's you doing the complying, Judge.
There's 1 0 of us, only two of you.

315
00:33:12,491 --> 00:33:14,492
Why don't you step out
from behind that doorway,

316
00:33:14,576 --> 00:33:15,951
or we're gonna blow the fuck out of you.

317
00:33:16,078 --> 00:33:17,745
Ten seconds to comply.

318
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,289
-Fuck you, Judge.
-You got five.

319
00:33:21,124 --> 00:33:23,084
Thanks for the heads-up.

320
00:33:42,521 --> 00:33:43,604
Please.

321
00:33:44,815 --> 00:33:46,816
What are you waiting for, rookie?

322
00:33:46,942 --> 00:33:51,278
His crime is attempted murder of a Judge.
His sentence is death.

323
00:33:53,156 --> 00:33:54,782
Yes, sir.

324
00:34:21,601 --> 00:34:22,935
Open up.

325
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:26,981
-Open up!
-Negative, Judge.

326
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:29,108
You know what's going on out here.

327
00:34:29,192 --> 00:34:30,776
We need a place we can defend.

328
00:34:30,861 --> 00:34:34,697
Then you better find someplace else.
This is a medical facility. Neutral ground.

329
00:34:34,823 --> 00:34:38,659
Neutral? You're not neutral.
You're choosing sides.

330
00:34:38,785 --> 00:34:42,121
Peach Trees has been sealed by
blast doors designed to withstand attack.

331
00:34:42,205 --> 00:34:44,790
No one's getting out. No one's coming in.

332
00:34:44,875 --> 00:34:48,836
And you have every clan affiliate
in the block after your blood.

333
00:34:49,004 --> 00:34:52,339
There are no sides. You're already dead.

334
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:15,196
Looks like the Med Center's
closed early today.

335
00:35:15,697 --> 00:35:20,367
Switch weapon to silencer mode.
Our best bet now is to go covert.

336
00:35:20,494 --> 00:35:24,330
Conserve ammunition.
And don't shoot unless you're gonna hit.

337
00:35:26,875 --> 00:35:29,794
-Sir, what about the prisoner?
-Explain.

338
00:35:30,212 --> 00:35:33,047
Under the circumstances,
he could be a liability.

339
00:35:33,215 --> 00:35:36,550
Also a prime suspect in three homicides.

340
00:35:37,385 --> 00:35:41,138
What do you say, rookie?
Wanna cut him loose?

341
00:35:42,057 --> 00:35:43,557
No, sir.

342
00:35:55,362 --> 00:35:56,695
Get up!

343
00:36:16,925 --> 00:36:18,759
Go, go, go, go!

344
00:36:38,363 --> 00:36:39,697
Hold up.

345
00:36:54,087 --> 00:36:57,047
-Move!
-Keep your eyes peeled.

346
00:36:57,173 --> 00:36:59,592
Man, stop telling me what to fucking do!

347
00:37:09,936 --> 00:37:11,854
l know that new shit...

348
00:37:19,529 --> 00:37:20,529
Cathy?

349
00:37:21,531 --> 00:37:24,450
-Who's there?
-Cathy, open the door.

350
00:37:31,207 --> 00:37:32,958
We're not gonna hurt you.

351
00:37:47,474 --> 00:37:48,474
Clear.

352
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:53,228
Secure the woman somewhere
she can't raise any alarms.

353
00:37:53,355 --> 00:37:54,939
We can't.

354
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:59,818
She has a baby. Asleep in the next room.

355
00:37:59,945 --> 00:38:02,237
We can't secure her if we don't know
when she'll be freed.

356
00:38:02,364 --> 00:38:03,864
ls there a father?

357
00:38:04,407 --> 00:38:07,493
He's out there. Looking for us.

358
00:38:09,037 --> 00:38:11,538
Say that. What you were just thinking.

359
00:38:11,665 --> 00:38:15,501
-How did you...
-lt's okay. Go ahead.

360
00:38:18,088 --> 00:38:20,089
l'm not raising any alarms.

361
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:23,926
lf the men out there don't know where
you are, you won't be killing them.

362
00:38:24,052 --> 00:38:25,469
Go on.

363
00:38:26,805 --> 00:38:29,515
There's a service elevator near here.

364
00:38:29,641 --> 00:38:32,309
The sign says it's broken, but

365
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:39,274
it works as long as you're hitting
a button above level 75.

366
00:38:39,484 --> 00:38:42,820
l just want you off my level.
Away from my family.

367
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:16,645
-Cathy, l...
-Don't thank me.

368
00:39:17,564 --> 00:39:21,692
lt's not for you.
l just don't wanna see you again.

369
00:39:25,447 --> 00:39:27,031
You won't.

370
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:59,271
This drug shifts like nothing I've ever seen.

371
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:02,399
If we play this right,
we could take the whole fucking city.

372
00:40:02,859 --> 00:40:06,028
The only danger is we expand too fast.

373
00:40:06,488 --> 00:40:09,573
ln the last few days, we've added
distribution to three new blocks.

374
00:40:09,908 --> 00:40:13,577
And pretty soon, we're looking at
making inroads into Sectors 9 and 1 5.

375
00:40:13,703 --> 00:40:16,121
Fifteen is still Red territory.

376
00:40:16,206 --> 00:40:17,331
Ma.

377
00:40:18,124 --> 00:40:19,917
You better come quick.

378
00:40:21,169 --> 00:40:26,131
Okay. We got one here,
maybe 1 1 outside the Med Center.

379
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:29,510
There's eight in the stairwell
and another five on level 1 8.

380
00:40:29,636 --> 00:40:33,514
They've downed 30 plus
and haven't even taken a scratch.

381
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:34,640
Where are they now?

382
00:40:34,724 --> 00:40:37,726
l don't know, but they seem
to be moving their way up the block.

383
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:41,605
No, wait, wait. l just picked them up.
They're on level 76, west quadrant.

384
00:40:41,731 --> 00:40:43,273
Do you want me to patch you back
into the PA?

385
00:40:43,358 --> 00:40:46,401
We could get level 60 through 80
converging on them.

386
00:40:46,528 --> 00:40:48,779
No. Can you seal them in there?

387
00:40:48,905 --> 00:40:53,325
Sure. War override gives me
total control of the building.

388
00:41:14,055 --> 00:41:15,681
That's not good.

389
00:41:16,099 --> 00:41:18,767
Full lockdown. They're going nowhere.

390
00:41:19,978 --> 00:41:24,022
l tried to do this clean, but they wouldn't
let me. So now we do it messy.

391
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:28,151
Too late, Judge.

392
00:41:31,614 --> 00:41:33,323
Caleb, come in.

393
00:41:33,449 --> 00:41:34,449
Ma.

394
00:41:35,785 --> 00:41:39,204
We've got them cornered.
We're taking them down right now.

395
00:41:46,087 --> 00:41:48,630
We'd need oxyacetylene to cut through.

396
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:52,676
They know where we are.
Why aren't they coming after us?

397
00:41:52,802 --> 00:41:54,803
That's what worries me.

398
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:03,520
Take him back to the main lobby.
Hold position behind the elevator shaft.

399
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:06,064
Be a good place to defend.

400
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:08,775
Where are you going?

401
00:42:09,027 --> 00:42:12,487
lf l don't come back, and you get cornered,

402
00:42:13,281 --> 00:42:15,949
you might not wanna get taken alive.

403
00:42:17,952 --> 00:42:19,870
Your call.

404
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:21,371
Sir.

405
00:42:52,695 --> 00:42:54,696
Get away from the door!

406
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:05,582
Sit down!

407
00:43:25,812 --> 00:43:27,562
He's right, you know.

408
00:43:29,065 --> 00:43:32,401
About not wanting to be taken alive.

409
00:43:33,236 --> 00:43:36,321
The stuff the clan
would do to a girl like you...

410
00:43:39,117 --> 00:43:40,117
Nasty.

411
00:43:51,671 --> 00:43:55,674
We had a girl one time,
girl about your age and...

412
00:44:00,930 --> 00:44:02,681
Well, anyway...

413
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:07,519
l'm just saying,
save the last bullet for yourself.

414
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:10,313
Yeah, and l'll save
the second to last one for you.

415
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:11,440
Sure.

416
00:44:15,528 --> 00:44:17,362
So you're a mutant?

417
00:44:18,239 --> 00:44:22,492
Most of you poor fuckers
got three stumpy arms, or no arms.

418
00:44:23,578 --> 00:44:28,665
But l guess you lucked out.
You fit together pretty well.

419
00:44:33,588 --> 00:44:37,424
Psychic. So fucked up.

420
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:41,428
Yeah, l heard about your kind.

421
00:44:42,263 --> 00:44:44,598
Kind of hard to believe it's real.

422
00:44:47,393 --> 00:44:49,770
Like what am l thinking about right now?

423
00:44:55,610 --> 00:44:58,862
You're picturing a violent sexual liaison
between the two of us

424
00:44:58,946 --> 00:45:01,239
in a pointless attempt to shock me.

425
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:06,036
You're good.
But l wasn't trying to shock you.

426
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:08,830
lf l was trying to shock you,
l'd have been thinking about this.

427
00:45:10,833 --> 00:45:13,293
What are you thinking about now, huh?

428
00:45:30,144 --> 00:45:32,771
-What the fuck was that?
-Get back inside.

429
00:45:36,442 --> 00:45:38,110
Hurry the fuck up.

430
00:45:38,986 --> 00:45:40,987
Move your fucking asses.

431
00:46:00,466 --> 00:46:02,300
Move! Move!

432
00:46:05,513 --> 00:46:09,516
Back in the house. Get in the house, now!

433
00:46:13,521 --> 00:46:14,604
Shit!

434
00:46:15,022 --> 00:46:16,189
Fire!

435
00:46:26,033 --> 00:46:28,410
Frank! Frankie! Let's go!

436
00:46:59,066 --> 00:47:00,108
Move.

437
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:28,637
Get back!

438
00:47:36,145 --> 00:47:37,395
Concentrate the fire.

439
00:47:51,327 --> 00:47:52,744
High ex!

440
00:47:55,206 --> 00:47:56,206
Move!

441
00:49:07,194 --> 00:49:09,529
There's no way they survived.

442
00:49:10,656 --> 00:49:13,325
They're not dead till we find them dead.

443
00:49:16,871 --> 00:49:18,872
Or part of them anyway.

444
00:49:34,764 --> 00:49:36,514
Comms are back on.

445
00:49:37,725 --> 00:49:39,726
Control. Do you copy?

446
00:49:39,852 --> 00:49:40,935
Affirmative.

447
00:49:41,062 --> 00:49:45,190
1 0-24 on my GPS.
Request immediate assistance.

448
00:49:45,316 --> 00:49:48,193
Copy, 10-24. Judges under fire.

449
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:52,447
Showing your Iocation as Peach Trees,
Sector 13. Confirm.

450
00:49:52,573 --> 00:49:56,826
Confirm. Be advised,
blast door defenses have been triggered.

451
00:49:57,661 --> 00:50:00,246
Can you hoId your current GPS?

452
00:50:03,167 --> 00:50:04,501
Negative.

453
00:50:05,586 --> 00:50:08,213
lf they come for us,
we've got nowhere to go.

454
00:50:08,339 --> 00:50:12,342
Copy that. Backup is on its way.
Just stay alive.

455
00:50:14,470 --> 00:50:16,388
We gotta go back in.

456
00:50:47,795 --> 00:50:50,547
God damn it, man! What the fuck?

457
00:50:53,592 --> 00:50:55,176
No! No, no!

458
00:51:28,544 --> 00:51:31,212
Your gang locks down a whole block.

459
00:51:32,173 --> 00:51:35,383
Massacres an entire quadrant of men,
women and children,

460
00:51:35,468 --> 00:51:37,343
just to take out two Judges.

461
00:51:37,970 --> 00:51:40,221
Sound like overkill to you?

462
00:51:52,776 --> 00:51:55,111
l'll tell you what l think.

463
00:51:55,237 --> 00:51:59,365
l think if we'd executed you at the bust,
Ma-Ma would have let us walk out of here.

464
00:52:02,536 --> 00:52:06,247
What she doesn't want
is you taken back to the Sector house.

465
00:52:06,373 --> 00:52:11,044
She doesn't want you interrogated.
She's afraid of what you might say.

466
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:13,755
And that's got me curious.

467
00:52:16,884 --> 00:52:19,219
-Spill it!
-Fuck you!

468
00:52:23,891 --> 00:52:24,891
Sir.

469
00:52:26,393 --> 00:52:27,393
Sir!

470
00:52:28,562 --> 00:52:31,564
lf you leave it to me,
he doesn't have to speak.

471
00:52:46,747 --> 00:52:49,749
What are you up to, bitch?

472
00:52:53,504 --> 00:52:55,797
Welcome to the inside of your head.

473
00:52:58,592 --> 00:53:00,343
lt's kind of empty in here.

474
00:53:01,095 --> 00:53:06,432
l don't know what kind of mutant shit this is,
but if my hands weren't cuffed...

475
00:53:06,517 --> 00:53:09,769
You aren't cuffed, if you don't wanna be.

476
00:53:14,817 --> 00:53:17,026
My head. Do what l like?

477
00:53:17,111 --> 00:53:18,111
Sure.

478
00:53:22,283 --> 00:53:25,451
Thinking about hurting me
doesn't actually hurt me.

479
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:28,454
Yeah. Points to you.

480
00:53:28,539 --> 00:53:31,874
Except there is that thing.

481
00:53:32,334 --> 00:53:33,793
What thing was that?

482
00:53:33,961 --> 00:53:36,462
That l know how to freak you the fuck out.

483
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:39,674
See, if you're taIking about
my fucked-up head

484
00:53:40,801 --> 00:53:43,177
versus your fucked-up head,

485
00:53:45,514 --> 00:53:47,640
your fucked-up head is gonna lose.

486
00:53:51,979 --> 00:53:54,022
l figured that would shut you up.

487
00:53:54,148 --> 00:53:56,983
Hey. l can play mind games, too.

488
00:53:59,361 --> 00:54:03,031
You fucking bitch! You sick fucking bitch!

489
00:54:03,157 --> 00:54:05,325
We haven't even started.

490
00:54:19,715 --> 00:54:21,049
Got it.

491
00:54:26,513 --> 00:54:31,017
Peach Trees is the manufacturing base
for all the Slo-Mo in Mega City One.

492
00:54:31,185 --> 00:54:35,688
Ma-Ma's controlling the production
and distribution across the whole city.

493
00:54:37,024 --> 00:54:38,358
lnteresting.

494
00:54:49,662 --> 00:54:51,496
Peach Trees. Can l help you?

495
00:54:51,664 --> 00:54:54,582
We're responding to a report of Judges
under fire from within this bIock.

496
00:54:54,708 --> 00:54:57,543
Judges under fire?
l'm unaware of any such activity.

497
00:54:57,795 --> 00:55:00,254
We're actually undergoing
a scheduled war defense test.

498
00:55:00,339 --> 00:55:04,467
Not anymore, you're not.
Open the blast door right now.

499
00:55:04,718 --> 00:55:08,137
Yes, sir. The problem is
we've had a software malfunction

500
00:55:08,222 --> 00:55:10,139
and l've lost control of the system.

501
00:55:11,684 --> 00:55:13,976
We've had a fire on level 76.

502
00:55:18,232 --> 00:55:22,735
You better get controI fast. Or I'm sIapping
you with an obstruction ofjustice charge.

503
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:25,488
Five years in the cubes, mandatory.

504
00:55:25,656 --> 00:55:28,616
Will do, sir. l'm on it right now. Thank you.

505
00:55:37,292 --> 00:55:39,001
We have new intel about Ma-Ma,

506
00:55:39,086 --> 00:55:41,421
and we've managed
to get a 1 0-24 to Control.

507
00:55:41,588 --> 00:55:44,799
Parameters are shifting.
What are the options, Anderson?

508
00:55:44,925 --> 00:55:49,095
Keep moving and attempt to avoid further
detection, or find a place to defend.

509
00:55:49,179 --> 00:55:51,848
Same as before, except now
we know backup's inbound.

510
00:55:51,974 --> 00:55:54,642
You're giving us two options.
Defend or hide.

511
00:55:54,768 --> 00:55:56,102
Yes, sir.

512
00:55:56,770 --> 00:56:00,106
What about we attack?
Head straight for Ma-Ma.

513
00:56:00,274 --> 00:56:02,191
ls that an option?

514
00:56:02,317 --> 00:56:05,278
Well, she's guilty. We're Judges.

515
00:56:05,362 --> 00:56:09,866
Sir, with backup inbound, l think we should
wait until the odds have shifted in our favor.

516
00:56:12,369 --> 00:56:13,870
Wrong answer?

517
00:56:14,663 --> 00:56:16,664
You're the psychic.

518
00:56:27,634 --> 00:56:28,634
Clear.

519
00:56:38,771 --> 00:56:40,438
Why didn't you shoot him?

520
00:56:40,522 --> 00:56:43,858
What do you mean, why didn't l shoot him?
Why didn't you?

521
00:56:45,319 --> 00:56:46,819
-Okay, we could do it now.
-Do it.

522
00:56:46,904 --> 00:56:48,029
-No, you do it.
-You do it!

523
00:56:50,824 --> 00:56:52,617
Shit! Shit!

524
00:56:53,869 --> 00:56:56,287
Why did it have to be us who found him?

525
00:56:56,371 --> 00:56:58,831
All right. Come on. Come on.

526
00:57:03,712 --> 00:57:07,048
lnfo terminal. Let's check the schematics.

527
00:57:27,653 --> 00:57:29,487
Freeze!

528
00:57:33,867 --> 00:57:34,951
Why?

529
00:57:37,871 --> 00:57:39,372
Why what?

530
00:57:41,542 --> 00:57:43,543
Well, why should l freeze?

531
00:57:46,463 --> 00:57:49,298
Because otherwise l'll shoot you.

532
00:57:51,176 --> 00:57:52,343
With the safety on?

533
00:57:54,471 --> 00:57:55,471
lt isn't.

534
00:58:01,895 --> 00:58:05,898
How do you want it, kids?
Body bags orjuve-cubes?

535
00:58:06,066 --> 00:58:07,650
Makes no difference to me.

536
00:58:10,863 --> 00:58:12,363
Fuck!

537
00:58:15,325 --> 00:58:16,325
Stun!

538
00:58:39,766 --> 00:58:41,767
You are so fucked.

539
00:58:59,161 --> 00:59:00,995
-Blondie.
-Come on!

540
00:59:01,121 --> 00:59:02,997
Come on, you bitch.

541
00:59:13,926 --> 00:59:15,468
Hold that bitch down.

542
00:59:16,053 --> 00:59:17,136
Jesus.

543
00:59:17,262 --> 00:59:20,598
-Now then, what am l gonna do with you?
-You're going to do nothing.

544
00:59:24,645 --> 00:59:26,896
All this trouble is your doing.

545
00:59:27,397 --> 00:59:32,234
When you got busted, you should have
killed the Judges or been killed yourself.

546
00:59:33,153 --> 00:59:36,197
But instead you let yourself
get taken like the dumb fuck you are.

547
00:59:36,281 --> 00:59:37,281
But l...

548
00:59:40,118 --> 00:59:41,786
Shut the fuck up.

549
00:59:43,956 --> 00:59:48,626
l'd kill you myself, but l already lost
plenty today. l can't afford to lose more.

550
00:59:57,052 --> 01:00:00,388
Sooner or later, the Justice Department
is gonna come through the blast doors

551
01:00:00,472 --> 01:00:02,556
looking for their Judges.

552
01:00:04,309 --> 01:00:08,980
They'll find their bodies all shot up.
One on level 25,

553
01:00:10,148 --> 01:00:13,484
one in the Slo-Mo den.
Just a bust that went wrong.

554
01:00:14,695 --> 01:00:16,696
That means no torture.

555
01:00:17,447 --> 01:00:21,117
No raping, no skinning. Just a bunch
of bullets to the head and chest.

556
01:00:21,576 --> 01:00:23,327
-Do you understand me?
-Yes.

557
01:00:23,453 --> 01:00:26,163
-Do you fucking understand me?
-Yes.

558
01:00:26,289 --> 01:00:27,289
Ma.

559
01:00:29,918 --> 01:00:31,502
He's back.

560
01:00:41,096 --> 01:00:45,266
lt's the other Judge. He's patched himself
into one of the terminals.

561
01:00:45,392 --> 01:00:48,769
-l think he's trying to access the PA.
-Can't you stop him?

562
01:00:48,854 --> 01:00:51,188
l can shut down the whole system,

563
01:00:51,273 --> 01:00:54,400
but if you let him talk,
l can trace which terminal he's using.

564
01:00:55,318 --> 01:00:56,986
We'll know exactly where he is.

565
01:01:09,916 --> 01:01:12,334
Inhabitants of Peach Trees.

566
01:01:13,170 --> 01:01:15,046
This is Judge Dredd.

567
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:18,549
Let him talk.

568
01:01:19,509 --> 01:01:22,094
In case you people have forgotten,

569
01:01:22,721 --> 01:01:26,932
this block operates under the same
rules as the rest of the city.

570
01:01:27,726 --> 01:01:30,061
Ma-Ma is not the Iaw.

571
01:01:30,729 --> 01:01:32,438
l am the law.

572
01:01:33,648 --> 01:01:35,983
Ma-Ma is a common criminaI.

573
01:01:37,652 --> 01:01:39,612
GuiIty of murder.

574
01:01:40,614 --> 01:01:45,117
GuiIty of the manufacture and distribution
of the narcotic known as SIo-Mo.

575
01:01:45,577 --> 01:01:48,913
And as of now, under sentence of death.

576
01:01:50,457 --> 01:01:52,583
Any who obstruct me
in carrying out my duty

577
01:01:52,667 --> 01:01:55,503
wiII be treated
as an accessory to her crimes.

578
01:01:56,797 --> 01:01:58,798
You have been warned.

579
01:02:00,634 --> 01:02:02,635
And as for you, Ma-Ma...

580
01:02:04,930 --> 01:02:06,931
Judgment time.

581
01:02:10,102 --> 01:02:15,064
l got him. He's only 1 0 levels below us.
South quad balcony. Terminal 5.

582
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:16,774
Motherfucker.

583
01:02:38,380 --> 01:02:40,631
Fucker still hasn't gone down.

584
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:03,904
lt's not him.

585
01:03:07,868 --> 01:03:09,368
lncendiary.

586
01:03:48,325 --> 01:03:50,451
How the fuck are we gonna stop this guy?

587
01:03:54,497 --> 01:03:55,998
Call 91 1 .

588
01:04:25,153 --> 01:04:27,279
Got a 1 0-24 from this block.

589
01:04:27,364 --> 01:04:31,867
Two Judges under fire, requesting urgent
assistance and you're standing outside.

590
01:04:31,952 --> 01:04:35,621
Block's under lockdown.
Malfunction with their defense system.

591
01:04:41,127 --> 01:04:43,170
Open up. Now!

592
01:04:49,344 --> 01:04:51,387
You're relieved.

593
01:05:06,111 --> 01:05:07,861
So what have we got?

594
01:05:07,988 --> 01:05:11,323
Two Judges trigger a turf war.
Judges die in pursuit of duty.

595
01:05:11,491 --> 01:05:14,410
-And the perps who killed the Judges?
-Laid out here.

596
01:05:14,494 --> 01:05:16,245
-Sounds right.
-Excuse me.

597
01:05:18,915 --> 01:05:22,042
lt's not what's happened.
l've been here from the start.

598
01:05:22,127 --> 01:05:25,004
This killing's all about one gang.
The Ma-Ma clan.

599
01:05:25,130 --> 01:05:26,839
And from the sound of gunfire,

600
01:05:26,965 --> 01:05:29,800
l'd say at least one of your two Judges
is still alive.

601
01:05:29,926 --> 01:05:32,261
-Are you prepared to testify to that?
-Sure.

602
01:05:57,412 --> 01:05:59,705
One million credits.

603
01:06:00,040 --> 01:06:01,123
A million?

604
01:06:01,207 --> 01:06:03,959
You have a problem with a Judge.
You know who he is?

605
01:06:04,210 --> 01:06:05,336
No.

606
01:06:06,046 --> 01:06:08,130
l do. One million.

607
01:06:09,549 --> 01:06:10,549
Fine.

608
01:06:10,759 --> 01:06:15,846
Kaplan, protection detail on client.
Chan, Alvarez, we're flushing him out.

609
01:06:15,972 --> 01:06:17,639
You got it.

610
01:06:17,932 --> 01:06:20,809
-Where's the other one? The rookie.
-We got her here.

611
01:06:20,935 --> 01:06:23,228
-Dead or alive?
-Alive.

612
01:06:24,397 --> 01:06:26,065
Make her dead.

613
01:08:08,793 --> 01:08:11,128
You, there. ldentify yourself.

614
01:08:12,589 --> 01:08:15,924
-Chan. Sector 9.
-Dredd. Sector 1 3.

615
01:08:17,218 --> 01:08:19,720
Responding to your 1 0-24.

616
01:08:25,310 --> 01:08:26,810
Good to see you, Dredd.

617
01:08:27,604 --> 01:08:29,813
Likewise. You alone?

618
01:08:29,898 --> 01:08:33,650
Negative. Three-man squad.
Closing on my vector right now.

619
01:08:34,819 --> 01:08:36,403
So relax.

620
01:08:36,529 --> 01:08:38,238
Cavalry's here.

621
01:08:40,617 --> 01:08:41,700
Two.

622
01:08:42,702 --> 01:08:43,785
Two?

623
01:08:44,746 --> 01:08:47,372
Two of us called in the 1 0-24.

624
01:08:48,541 --> 01:08:51,460
Wondering why
you didn't ask about the other one.

625
01:08:53,213 --> 01:08:54,713
Lex, move it!

626
01:09:02,222 --> 01:09:04,014
Choke on it, Dredd.

627
01:09:17,570 --> 01:09:18,654
Choke on that.

628
01:09:34,254 --> 01:09:35,921
Shit!

629
01:09:58,611 --> 01:10:02,614
Bet you thought you were gonna
make your family proud, huh?

630
01:10:05,076 --> 01:10:07,077
Not much chance of that now.

631
01:10:08,746 --> 01:10:12,082
Now this, l always wanted one of these.
This is...

632
01:10:13,626 --> 01:10:18,630
You were shit out of luck when you ran into
the Ma-Ma clan. But don't feel too bad.

633
01:10:19,048 --> 01:10:23,969
l seen a lot of Judges in my time,
and you're just not cut out for this.

634
01:10:24,095 --> 01:10:27,806
l mean, if you didn't get killed today,
it was gonna be tomorrow.

635
01:10:27,974 --> 01:10:30,642
Or it was gonna be the day after that.

636
01:10:32,145 --> 01:10:33,186
Anyway,

637
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:36,231
today it is.

638
01:10:40,153 --> 01:10:42,654
You got any last words, bitch?

639
01:10:47,201 --> 01:10:48,869
That's funny.

640
01:10:49,537 --> 01:10:51,538
l was gonna ask you that.

641
01:10:52,290 --> 01:10:53,498
Bitch.

642
01:11:40,630 --> 01:11:42,214
Kay's dead.

643
01:11:42,632 --> 01:11:45,384
-Find somewhere to hide.
-Where are you going?

644
01:11:45,510 --> 01:11:48,887
l've got the girl cold.
l see her first, l shoot her.

645
01:11:49,013 --> 01:11:53,016
She sees me first, she hesitates,
then l shoot her.

646
01:13:26,611 --> 01:13:29,571
What's the price of a Judge these days?

647
01:13:30,865 --> 01:13:32,199
Million.

648
01:13:36,996 --> 01:13:39,247
Split four ways.

649
01:13:44,170 --> 01:13:46,004
Three ways now.

650
01:13:46,464 --> 01:13:47,756
Suits me.

651
01:13:52,595 --> 01:13:54,930
Doesn't sound like much.

652
01:13:57,975 --> 01:13:59,643
To betray the law.

653
01:14:06,484 --> 01:14:08,151
Betray the city.

654
01:14:11,989 --> 01:14:14,366
Save that shit for the rookies.

655
01:14:15,034 --> 01:14:17,702
Twenty years l've been on the streets.

656
01:14:19,497 --> 01:14:22,165
You know what Mega City One is, Dredd?

657
01:14:23,626 --> 01:14:25,919
lt's a fucking meat grinder.

658
01:14:26,838 --> 01:14:28,630
People go in one end.

659
01:14:35,388 --> 01:14:37,848
And meat comes out the other.

660
01:14:42,395 --> 01:14:44,187
All we do

661
01:14:44,897 --> 01:14:47,065
is turn the handle.

662
01:14:57,034 --> 01:14:58,076
Rapid fire.

663
01:15:00,413 --> 01:15:02,205
lncendiary. Armor piercing.

664
01:15:03,666 --> 01:15:04,916
High ex.

665
01:15:09,505 --> 01:15:11,339
Motherfucker.

666
01:15:15,428 --> 01:15:16,469
Two-way split.

667
01:15:17,555 --> 01:15:21,266
Yeah, l'd be breaking a sweat,
if you hadn't just run out of bullets.

668
01:15:37,742 --> 01:15:40,660
Lower your gun, rookie. l'm your backup.

669
01:16:02,308 --> 01:16:03,516
Armor piercing.

670
01:16:39,470 --> 01:16:40,470
Wait.

671
01:16:43,474 --> 01:16:44,474
Wait?

672
01:16:46,060 --> 01:16:49,020
Are you kidding me?
Did you just say "wait"?

673
01:16:52,024 --> 01:16:53,650
Judge Dredd,

674
01:16:55,361 --> 01:16:57,320
the Judge Dredd

675
01:16:58,155 --> 01:17:00,991
finally gets on the wrong end of a gun,

676
01:17:01,075 --> 01:17:03,994
and what he says is "wait."

677
01:17:05,705 --> 01:17:09,332
You know what? l expected more of you.

678
01:17:10,167 --> 01:17:14,170
l mean, wait for what?
Wait for me to change my mind?

679
01:17:14,380 --> 01:17:16,131
Wait for another two or three seconds of life

680
01:17:16,215 --> 01:17:19,426
because you're so fucking weak
you just can't stand to see it end?

681
01:17:20,845 --> 01:17:21,845
No.

682
01:17:29,562 --> 01:17:31,730
Wait for her to shoot you.

683
01:17:37,236 --> 01:17:38,236
Okay.

684
01:17:39,030 --> 01:17:41,239
Basic field dressing.

685
01:18:02,053 --> 01:18:03,386
Reload.

686
01:18:11,270 --> 01:18:12,270
Ready?

687
01:18:12,688 --> 01:18:13,730
Yeah.

688
01:18:14,815 --> 01:18:15,899
You look ready.

689
01:18:49,100 --> 01:18:52,477
No, don't shoot! Please don't shoot me!

690
01:18:52,645 --> 01:18:56,147
l'm not armed. l'm not armed.
l can help you.

691
01:18:56,273 --> 01:18:57,273
How?

692
01:18:57,983 --> 01:19:02,445
Ma-Ma's in her private quarters,
but it's behind 1 0 inches of steel.

693
01:19:02,571 --> 01:19:06,908
So you can't get in there without the keypad
combination. l can give that to you.

694
01:19:08,285 --> 01:19:11,329
l don't need your cooperation
to get the combination from you.

695
01:19:13,624 --> 01:19:15,166
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

696
01:19:24,301 --> 01:19:25,301
Go.

697
01:19:26,679 --> 01:19:28,221
Get out of here.

698
01:19:34,353 --> 01:19:35,979
Mind explaining yourself, rookie?

699
01:19:36,063 --> 01:19:39,274
Abetting a felon is not just a fail offense.
lt's a crime.

700
01:19:39,358 --> 01:19:43,236
l already picked up the fail
when l lost my primary weapon.

701
01:19:43,320 --> 01:19:46,865
l'm not gonna be a Judge, and l don't need
to be a mind-reader to know it.

702
01:19:46,991 --> 01:19:48,241
He's a victim, not a perp.

703
01:19:48,325 --> 01:19:52,287
And until my assessment is formally over,
l'm still entitled to dispense justice.

704
01:19:52,371 --> 01:19:55,623
And that's what l just did by letting him go.

705
01:19:55,916 --> 01:19:58,585
Maybe that'll be
the one difference l do make.

706
01:19:58,711 --> 01:20:02,547
The code to Ma-Ma's chambers is 4-9-4-3-6.

707
01:20:02,673 --> 01:20:04,340
Let's finish this.

708
01:21:33,055 --> 01:21:35,139
You're a piece of work, Dredd.

709
01:21:37,559 --> 01:21:39,143
But then so am l.

710
01:21:40,479 --> 01:21:45,149
You think l didn't know l'd get busted
some day. Goes with the territory.

711
01:21:45,317 --> 01:21:49,070
This entire level is rigged
with enough high explosives

712
01:21:49,196 --> 01:21:51,447
to take out the top 50 stories.

713
01:21:52,533 --> 01:21:55,201
lf they go, the rest go, too.

714
01:21:59,373 --> 01:22:00,581
Like the jewelry?

715
01:22:03,752 --> 01:22:06,838
lt's a transmitter synched to my heart beat.

716
01:22:07,506 --> 01:22:09,507
My heart stops beating,

717
01:22:10,467 --> 01:22:14,679
the building blows. Everyone in it, ash.

718
01:22:19,018 --> 01:22:21,311
You got no way out, Judge.

719
01:22:23,522 --> 01:22:25,690
Put your gun down.

720
01:22:27,234 --> 01:22:30,570
Do you know
how many people live in this block?

721
01:22:31,363 --> 01:22:36,075
This isn't a negotiation.
The sentence is death.

722
01:22:37,369 --> 01:22:39,829
You can't afford to take the risk.

723
01:23:17,743 --> 01:23:19,577
We're a kilometer above ground.

724
01:23:20,913 --> 01:23:23,414
What do you figure
the range is on that thing?

725
01:23:24,792 --> 01:23:27,085
Could it get through 1 00 levels of concrete?

726
01:23:28,420 --> 01:23:29,921
How about 200?

727
01:23:31,090 --> 01:23:32,673
Let's find out.

728
01:23:47,147 --> 01:23:51,109
Citizen Ma-Ma.
Your crimes are multiple homicide

729
01:23:51,235 --> 01:23:54,612
and the manufacture
and distribution of narcotics.

730
01:23:54,738 --> 01:23:56,322
How do you plead?

731
01:24:03,080 --> 01:24:04,789
Defense noted.

732
01:26:30,519 --> 01:26:31,852
Yeah!

733
01:27:29,661 --> 01:27:30,995
Anderson.

734
01:27:32,164 --> 01:27:35,916
Victims first.
Let the perps lay where they lie, huh?

735
01:27:37,878 --> 01:27:40,004
Your assessment's now over.

736
01:27:55,479 --> 01:27:56,479
Sir.

737
01:28:03,111 --> 01:28:06,614
When l heard you'd called in a 1 0-24,
l thought l'd better check it out.

738
01:28:06,740 --> 01:28:09,283
Seeing as l forced the rookie on you.

739
01:28:09,409 --> 01:28:12,745
-So, what happened in there?
-Drug bust.

740
01:28:12,871 --> 01:28:16,666
-Look like you been through it.
-Perps were uncooperative.

741
01:28:17,459 --> 01:28:18,542
So how did she do?

742
01:28:20,045 --> 01:28:22,546
She a pass or a fail?

743
01:28:25,759 --> 01:28:27,301
Let's take a look, huh?

744
01:28:28,136 --> 01:28:29,679
She's a pass.

745
01:28:31,098 --> 01:28:32,848
l knew she would be.

746
01:28:37,771 --> 01:28:39,397
No time to waste. Let's move.

747
01:28:39,523 --> 01:28:40,648
Tell them to go to the back...

748
01:28:51,326 --> 01:28:53,160
Mega City One.

749
01:28:54,621 --> 01:28:58,708
800 million people
living in the ruin of the old world

750
01:28:58,834 --> 01:29:01,293
and the mega structures of the new one.

751
01:29:03,422 --> 01:29:07,007
OnIy one thing
fighting for order in the chaos,

752
01:29:08,552 --> 01:29:09,760
Judges.
