00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,971
we're in solitary confinement.

173
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,041
Riley can't live here.

174
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,121
- She's right.<br/>- It's the worst.

175
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,611
FEAR: Really bad.<br/>DISGUST: It's absolutely the worst.

176
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,160
DISGUST: It's the worst place<br/>I've ever been in my entire life.

177
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,800
Hey, it's nothing<br/>our butterfly curtains couldn't fix.

178
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,162
I read somewhere<br/>that an empty room is an opportunity.

179
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,691
- Where did you read that?<br/>- It doesn't matter.

180
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,800
I read it and it's great.

181
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,921
We'll put the bed there.

182
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,081
JOY: And the desk over there.

183
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,321
FEAR: The hockey lamp goes there.

184
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,402
ANGER: Uh, put the chair there.

185
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,040
JOY: The trophy collection goes there.

186
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,684
FEAR: Stars! I like that!

187
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,841
JOY: Now we're talking!

188
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,680
Let's go get our stuff<br/>from the moving van!

189
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,565
DAD: All right. Goodbye.

190
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,681
Well, guess what?

191
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,480
The moving van<br/>won't be here until Thursday.

192
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,965
- You're kidding.<br/>- Mmm-hmm.

193
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,327
The van is lost? It is the worst day ever!

194
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,960
DISGUST: That figures. The van is lost.

195
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,526
You said it would be here yesterday!

196
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,886
I know that's what I said.<br/>That's what they told me!

197
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,047
FEAR: Mom and Dad are stressed out!

198
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,969
ANGER: They're stressed out?<br/>FEAR: What are we going to do?

199
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,560
- (ALL TALKING AT ONCE)<br/>- I've got a great idea!

200
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,250
Did you even read the contract?

201
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,887
Andersen makes her move.<br/>She's closing in!

202
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:17,961
Hey! (LAUGHS)

203
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,041
DAD: Oh, no, you're not!

204
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,207
She's lining up for the shot!

205
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,281
DAD: Coming behind you.

206
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,124
- DAD: Watch out! Watch out!<br/>- She shoots and she scores!

209
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,200
"Grandma"?

210
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,004
Uh-oh, she put her hair up,<br/>we're in for it!

211
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,606
Whoo!

212
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,529

00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,285
(SIGHS) All right. Stall for me.

220
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,401
I'll be right there.

221
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,370
The investor's supposed<br/>to show up on Thursday,

222
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,601
not today!

223
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,131
- (SIGHS)<br/>- I got to go.

224
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,605
It's okay. We get it.

225
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,926
You're the best. Thanks, hon.

226
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,880
See you, sweetie.

227
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,320
FEAR: Dad just left us.

228
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,004
He doesn't love us anymore.

229
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,241
That's sad.

230
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,890
I should drive, right?

231
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,447
Joy?

232
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,286
What are you doing?

233
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,970
Uh, just give me one second.

234
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,089
Um, you know what I've realized?

235
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,561
Riley hasn't had lunch! Remember?

236
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,606
Hey, I saw a pizza place down the street.

237
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,761
Maybe we could try that?

238
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,205
Pizza sounds delicious.

239
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,850
- Pizza? That's good.<br/>- Yes! Pizza!

240
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,760
FEAR: What the heck is that?<br/>JOY: Who puts broccoli on pizza?

241
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,921
That's it. I'm done.

242
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,122
Congratulations, San Francisco,

243
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,406
you've ruined pizza!

244
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,686
First the Hawaiians

245
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,001
and now you!

246
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,447
What kind of a pizza place<br/>only serves one kind of pizza?

247
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,883
MOM: Must be<br/>a San Francisco thing, huh?

248
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,250
Still, it's not as bad as that soup.

249
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,288
- At that diner in Nebraska.<br/>- Oh, yeah.

250
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,761
The spoon stood up in the soup by itself!

251
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,080
RILEY: That was disgusting.

252
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,650
JOY: Oh, good. Family is running.

253
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,080
RILEY: Dad's got a steel stomach.

254
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,804
The drive out was pretty fun, huh?

255
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,000
What was your favorite part?

256
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,645
Spitting out the car window!

257
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,200
Definitely not when Dad was singing.

258
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,281
Wearing a seat belt!

259
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,120
Oh! What about the time<br/>with the dinosaur?

260
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,120
- Oh, that's the one.<br/>- Definitely!

261
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,641
DAD: Say cheese!

262
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,250
- Dad! Dad!<br/>- Honey!

263
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,640
DAD: Now hold still.<br/>MOM: The car!

264
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,929
Stop! No, no, no! (GRUNTING)

(DAD GROANS)

266
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:13,961
(LAUGHS) Nice one, Joy.

267
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,610
I liked that time at the dinosaur.

268
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,284
- That was pretty funny.<br/>- (MOM LAUGHING)

(GASPS)

270
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,085
Wait. What? What happened?

271
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,320
FEAR: She did something<br/>to the memory.

272
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,727
- What did you do?<br/>- I just touched it.

273
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,683
- That shouldn't make it change.<br/>- Change it back, Joy!

274
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,006
- I'm trying.<br/>- You can't change it back?

275
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,049
- No! I guess I can't!<br/>- Good going, Sadness.

276
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,810
Now when Riley thinks<br/>of that moment with Dad,

277
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,120
she's gonna feel sad.

278
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,805
- Bravo.<br/>- I'm sorry, Joy.

279
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,120
I don't really know...

280
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,685
I thought maybe if you...

281
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,006
(STAMMERING)

282
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,363
Joy, we've got a stairway coming up.

283
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,046
Just don't touch any other memories

284
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,560
until we figure out what's going on.

285
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:55,727
- Okay.<br/>- JOY: All right.

286
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,048
Get ready. This is a monster railing

287
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,083
and we are riding it all the way down!

288
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,200
- Wait, what? What happened?<br/>- (CLATTERING)

289
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,440
- (FEAR AND JOY GASP)<br/>- A Core Memory!

290
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,561
Oh, no!

291
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,846
Sadness, what are you doing?

292
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:17,921
SADNESS: It looked like<br/>one was crooked

293
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,929
so I opened it and then it fell out.

294
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,041
I...

295
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,241
Whoo-hoo!

296
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,724
It's just that...<br/>I wanted to maybe hold one.

- FEAR: Joy!<br/>- Whoa, whoa!

298
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,562
Sadness, you nearly<br/>touched a Core Memory.

00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,001
And when you touch them,<br/>we can't change them back.

I know. I'm sorry.

Something's wrong with me.

00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,089
It's like I'm having a breakdown.

303
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,248
You're not having<br/>a breakdown. It's stress.

304
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,011
I keep making mistakes like that.<br/>I'm awful.

305
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,242
- No, you're not.<br/>- And annoying.

(STUTTERING) You know what?

307
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,289
You can't focus on what's going wrong.

308
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,084
There's always a way to<br/>turn things around,

309
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,605
to find the fun.

310
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,484
Yeah. Find the fun.

311
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,240
I don't know how to do that.

00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,731
Okay. Well,

313
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,290
try to think of something funny.

314
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,641
Um... Oh!

315
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,445
Remember the funny movie<br/>where the dog dies?

316
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,483
Oh. Yeah, that's not...

317
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,284
What about that time with Meg

318
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,283
when Riley laughed so hard

319
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,408
milk came out of her nose?

320
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,689
(LAUGHING)

321
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,280
Yeah. That hurt. It felt like fire.

322
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,964
SADNESS: Ooh, it was awful.

323
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,690
Okay, okay, don't think of that.<br/>Let's try something else.

324
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,484
Uh, what are your favorite things to do?

325
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,806
My favorite?

326
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,287
Um... Well, I like it when we're outside.

327
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:33,290
That's good. Like there's<br/>the beach and sunshine.

328
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,765
Oh! Like that time

329
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,524
we buried Dad<br/>in the sand up to his neck.

330
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,847
SADNESS: I was thinking more like rain.

331
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,484
Rain? Rain is my favorite, too!

332
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,403
We can stomp around in puddles.

333
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:48,643
JOY: You know, there's cool umbrellas,<br/>lightning storms.

334
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,762
SADNESS: More like when<br/>the rain runs down our back

335
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,330
and makes our shoes soggy.

336
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,690
And we get all cold, shivery, and

337
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,610
everything just starts<br/>feeling droopy. (CRYING)

338
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,808
Oh, hey, hey. Hey, easy.

339
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,440
Why are you crying?

340
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:06,005
It's just like really the opposite<br/>of what we're going for here.

341
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,648
Crying helps me slow down and obsess

342
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,882
over the weight of life's problems.

343
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,126

Right before it goes to Headquarters.

1038

If we hurry, we can catch it.
