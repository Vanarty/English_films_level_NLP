1
00:00:17,486 --> 00:00:19,487
I want to, uh...

2
00:00:30,032 --> 00:00:33,068
taupe.

3
00:00:35,805 --> 00:00:37,439
- Is that...?
- Justice Thomas.

4
00:00:37,441 --> 00:00:38,440
I knew it.

5
00:00:38,442 --> 00:00:39,474
What can I do for you, Louis?

6
00:00:39,476 --> 00:00:41,643
Ah, to the point. Of course.

7
00:00:41,645 --> 00:00:43,378
I wanted t...

8
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:46,481
I wanted to congratulate you
on bringing in Pfister Insurance

9
00:00:46,483 --> 00:00:47,816
and let you know
I've taken the liberty

10
00:00:47,818 --> 00:00:49,317
of putting together
the initial paperwork.

11
00:00:49,319 --> 00:00:51,720
Excellent. Leave it there.

12
00:00:51,722 --> 00:00:53,088
I wanted to follow it through.

13
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:54,522
I would relish
the opportunity to...

14
00:00:54,524 --> 00:00:56,991
Nonsense.
Louis, it's beneath you.

15
00:00:56,993 --> 00:00:59,494
Oh, I think you'll find
nothing's beneath me.

16
00:00:59,496 --> 00:01:02,097
Are you offering
something untoward to me?

17
00:01:02,099 --> 00:01:05,033
I'm simply saying that
I'm not oblivious to the fact

18
00:01:05,035 --> 00:01:07,602
that there's change afoot,
firm dynamic-wise.

19
00:01:07,604 --> 00:01:09,671
We used to be... huh.

20
00:01:09,673 --> 00:01:12,674
Now, we're kinda... hmm.

21
00:01:12,676 --> 00:01:15,276
We might need a little... hmm.

22
00:01:15,278 --> 00:01:16,745
You know? Louis.

23
00:01:16,747 --> 00:01:20,815
I'd like things to operate with
a certain integrity around here.

24
00:01:20,817 --> 00:01:22,484
Oh, I admire that philosophy.

25
00:01:22,486 --> 00:01:24,319
I actually try
to live by it myself.

26
00:01:24,321 --> 00:01:25,787
Good.

27
00:01:25,789 --> 00:01:29,924
Now, can you do me a favor?

28
00:01:29,926 --> 00:01:31,259
Anything.

29
00:01:31,261 --> 00:01:33,128
Send Mike Ross to me.

30
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:35,830
Ross?
You want to work with Ross?

31
00:01:35,832 --> 00:01:37,365
He's actually
working for me right now

32
00:01:37,367 --> 00:01:40,135
on the Liquid Water litigation,

33
00:01:40,137 --> 00:01:42,203
and he's been on it for weeks,
and I wish I could do it,

34
00:01:42,205 --> 00:01:44,205
but I cannot.
I can't do it right now.

35
00:01:44,207 --> 00:01:45,673
Then forget I said anything.

36
00:01:45,675 --> 00:01:48,176
But I can give you Dickinson.

37
00:01:50,813 --> 00:01:52,881
Okay.

38
00:01:52,883 --> 00:01:55,316
Let me know how that works out.

39
00:01:55,318 --> 00:01:57,519
With Ross.

40
00:01:57,521 --> 00:01:59,521
Okay.

41
00:02:00,956 --> 00:02:03,591
Um, I am taking Mike exclusively
for the next two weeks.

42
00:02:03,593 --> 00:02:04,692
Excuse me?

43
00:02:04,694 --> 00:02:06,561
I'm calling in my chip.

44
00:02:06,563 --> 00:02:08,763
Our wager? The Price sisters?
My triumph?

45
00:02:08,765 --> 00:02:10,732
Does that ring a bell?
Can't have him.

46
00:02:10,734 --> 00:02:11,800
Oh, well,
then I guess you'd rather

47
00:02:11,802 --> 00:02:13,067
that I announce
to the entire office

48
00:02:13,069 --> 00:02:15,904
that the mighty Harvey Specter
is a welcher.

49
00:02:15,906 --> 00:02:20,275
I didn't welch.
You passed on him.

50
00:02:20,277 --> 00:02:22,577
Okay, please.
I'm begging you. I need him.

51
00:02:22,579 --> 00:02:24,045
Okay, tell you what, Louis.

52
00:02:24,047 --> 00:02:27,649
Just say out loud that I am
the best closer in New York,

53
00:02:27,651 --> 00:02:29,217
and you can have him. Fine.

54
00:02:29,219 --> 00:02:30,318
To Donna.

55
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:33,755
- No.
- Then we don't have a deal.

56
00:02:33,757 --> 00:02:35,056
Welcher.

57
00:02:35,058 --> 00:02:37,425
That was fun. Morning.

58
00:02:37,427 --> 00:02:40,261
If that's a big check,
I want another Marni bag.

59
00:02:40,263 --> 00:02:42,030
Hands off the vinyl, junior.

60
00:02:42,032 --> 00:02:43,932
10:00, nice of you to join us.

61
00:02:43,934 --> 00:02:45,500
I was closing Cranston
this morning.

62
00:02:45,502 --> 00:02:47,702
Oh, yeah? Couldn't get it done
by 9:00, huh?

63
00:02:47,704 --> 00:02:50,438
You're a little lippy
for a Monday.

64
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:53,274
- What the hell?
- What? What is it?

65
00:02:53,276 --> 00:02:55,109
"Draft of complaint
from Smith and Devane,

66
00:02:55,111 --> 00:02:57,045
threatening to reopen
Randall v. CM,"

67
00:02:57,047 --> 00:02:58,580
a case I won 4 years ago.

68
00:02:58,582 --> 00:02:59,914
Randall v. CM?

69
00:02:59,916 --> 00:03:02,050
Ah, accident
on the Merritt Parkway.

70
00:03:02,052 --> 00:03:03,885
They claimed it was
Coastal Motors' hood,

71
00:03:03,887 --> 00:03:07,355
you killed it in court
by saying it was the driver.

72
00:03:07,357 --> 00:03:09,290
This can't be surprising
to you anymore.

73
00:03:09,292 --> 00:03:10,391
They're saying
there's new evidence.

74
00:03:10,393 --> 00:03:12,427
New evidence?
It's product liability.

75
00:03:12,429 --> 00:03:14,495
The statute of limitations
is expired.

76
00:03:14,497 --> 00:03:15,930
Which means it's a shakedown.

77
00:03:15,932 --> 00:03:17,398
You gotta quash that shit.

78
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,601
I do, and I will.

79
00:03:19,603 --> 00:03:21,369
Whoa.

80
00:03:21,371 --> 00:03:24,105
Come on. The Spinners? Really?

81
00:03:24,107 --> 00:03:25,940
For your information,
the Spinners were

82
00:03:25,942 --> 00:03:28,610
one of the defining pop bands
of their time.

83
00:03:28,612 --> 00:03:30,178
Oh. Oh, wow, sorry.

84
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:32,747
Yeah, that's cool, like, uh,
like, the Jonas Brothers

85
00:03:32,749 --> 00:03:37,886
or Hanson or 'NSYNC
or Selena Gomez, yeah.

86
00:03:39,722 --> 00:03:41,189
Come here, lippy.
I want to show you something.

87
00:03:41,191 --> 00:03:44,659
Yeah?
What, you got Bieber fever?

88
00:03:53,469 --> 00:03:56,771
Prepare motions to dismiss
by end of day Thursday,

89
00:03:56,773 --> 00:03:58,373
and don't puss out
when Judge Edelstein

90
00:03:58,375 --> 00:04:00,141
tries to stifle my brilliance.

91
00:04:01,444 --> 00:04:04,512
- He's all yours.
- What?

92
00:04:04,514 --> 00:04:05,613
Why the sudden change of mind?

93
00:04:05,615 --> 00:04:06,981
Does it matter?

94
00:04:06,983 --> 00:04:07,982
You're punishing him,
aren't you?

95
00:04:07,984 --> 00:04:09,450
- Yes.
- So you're saying

96
00:04:09,452 --> 00:04:11,019
working for me is punishment?
As far as I'm concerned,

97
00:04:11,021 --> 00:04:12,453
this whole conversation's
punishment.

98
00:04:12,455 --> 00:04:13,454
Oh, here we go.

99
00:04:13,456 --> 00:04:14,822
- Duration?
- One case.

100
00:04:14,824 --> 00:04:16,324
- Jurisdiction?
- Exclusive.

101
00:04:16,326 --> 00:04:18,393
- What can I do to him?
- What do you want to do to him?

102
00:04:18,395 --> 00:04:21,029
Harvey.

103
00:04:21,031 --> 00:04:22,397
Things.

104
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,631
That is not
a legitimate answer.

105
00:04:23,633 --> 00:04:25,099
Honor the boundaries
of labor law?

106
00:04:25,101 --> 00:04:26,467
I prefer the Geneva Convention.

107
00:04:26,469 --> 00:04:29,537
- Then we have a deal.
- We...

108
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:34,075
I think I need a sick day.

109
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:43,151
Careful there, Harv.

110
00:04:43,153 --> 00:04:45,019
That's high-end
Brazilian cherry

111
00:04:45,021 --> 00:04:46,921
from the South American
rainforest.

112
00:04:46,923 --> 00:04:48,957
Tanner.
You selling furniture now?

113
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:52,493
No, but if we both did,
I'd sell more than you.

114
00:04:52,495 --> 00:04:54,329
I thought I told you
to stay out of my city.

115
00:04:54,331 --> 00:04:57,198
Can't. I'm the newest senior
partner at Smith and Devane.

116
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,466
Don't get too comfortable.

117
00:04:58,468 --> 00:05:00,635
If all you're bringing
is the Boston shakedown,

118
00:05:00,637 --> 00:05:01,869
you're not gonna be here long.

119
00:05:01,871 --> 00:05:03,304
Oh, I'm bringing
more than that, Harvey.

120
00:05:03,306 --> 00:05:05,106
Randall versus CM is a winner.

121
00:05:05,108 --> 00:05:06,374
That case was litigated.

122
00:05:06,376 --> 00:05:07,608
- Not by me.
- Well, let me

123
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:08,943
bring you up to speed.

124
00:05:08,945 --> 00:05:11,512
Frank Randall had a history
of substance abuse.

125
00:05:11,514 --> 00:05:14,048
His family tried to blame
Coastal Motors,

126
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:16,684
but his death had nothing to do
with the carmaker or its design.

127
00:05:16,686 --> 00:05:18,353
Yeah, well,
we've got new evidence

128
00:05:18,355 --> 00:05:19,921
that contradicts
that assertion.

129
00:05:19,923 --> 00:05:22,056
Oh, look at that,
you learned some new words.

130
00:05:22,058 --> 00:05:25,326
Even if it were true, the
statute of limitations ran out.

131
00:05:25,328 --> 00:05:27,095
Well, what you call
a shakedown,

132
00:05:27,097 --> 00:05:29,731
I call a sure thing.

133
00:05:29,733 --> 00:05:31,265
This is an internal memo.

134
00:05:31,267 --> 00:05:33,901
Showing that CM
knew about engineering defects.

135
00:05:33,903 --> 00:05:36,804
You're on the wrong side
of this one, Harvey.

136
00:05:36,806 --> 00:05:38,339
I never saw this thing
in my life.

137
00:05:38,341 --> 00:05:41,209
Sure looks like you did,
and that statute of limitations

138
00:05:41,211 --> 00:05:43,211
doesn't apply
to fraudulent concealment.

139
00:05:43,213 --> 00:05:45,079
I didn't conceal jack shit.

140
00:05:45,081 --> 00:05:46,614
Harvey, that's for your client.

141
00:05:46,616 --> 00:05:49,017
We want $46 million
and not a penny less,

142
00:05:49,019 --> 00:05:51,753
and this, well, that's for you

143
00:05:51,755 --> 00:05:54,088
because we're suing you
and your entire firm for fraud.

144
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:57,558
You really
want to come after me again?

145
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,494
I'm not moving down here
for the Sushi.

146
00:05:59,496 --> 00:06:01,629
0 and 2 doesn't look good
on a resume.

147
00:06:01,631 --> 00:06:04,065
You know, I'm thinking
Upper East Side.

148
00:06:04,067 --> 00:06:05,299
Well, why don't you check out

149
00:06:05,301 --> 00:06:08,569
the corner of
81st and kiss-my-ass?

This looks bad, Harvey.

160
00:06:46,851 --> 00:06:48,584
I don't care how it looks,
it's bullshit.

161
00:06:48,586 --> 00:06:50,552
Then tell me what's bullshit
because I'm looking at

162
00:06:50,554 --> 00:06:52,821
a document that undermines
your entire defense.

163
00:06:52,823 --> 00:06:54,890
An anonymous memo with names
and dates blacked out.

164
00:06:54,892 --> 00:06:57,759
It's damning, and it
implicates you in a cover-up.

165
00:06:57,761 --> 00:06:59,027
Never crossed my desk.

166
00:06:59,029 --> 00:07:03,999
I'm not saying it did.
I'm saying it looks bad.

167
00:07:04,001 --> 00:07:05,534
I don't want Daniel
knowing about this.

168
00:07:05,536 --> 00:07:07,903
I got nothing to hide.
I didn't do anything wrong.

169
00:07:07,905 --> 00:07:11,006
I believe you, but you're not
my only concern at the moment.

170
00:07:11,008 --> 00:07:13,142
You know full well
what Daniel will do

171
00:07:13,144 --> 00:07:14,977
if he finds out
you're being accused of fraud

172
00:07:14,979 --> 00:07:16,445
and it happened on my watch.

173
00:07:16,447 --> 00:07:18,780
He'll use it against us,
but I also know

174
00:07:18,782 --> 00:07:20,549
that he's familiar
with the people at CM,

175
00:07:20,551 --> 00:07:22,384
and he's bound to find out
sooner or later.

176
00:07:22,386 --> 00:07:25,320
Then make it go away
before it gets to sooner.

177
00:07:32,529 --> 00:07:34,229
Durham Foods v. Liquid Water.

178
00:07:34,231 --> 00:07:36,231
I need motions to dismiss,
compel,

179
00:07:36,233 --> 00:07:37,733
strike, and change venue.

180
00:07:37,735 --> 00:07:38,934
Why are they not finished yet?

181
00:07:38,936 --> 00:07:40,402
Okay, Louis,
I might be a quick study,

182
00:07:40,404 --> 00:07:43,172
but I'm gonna need a tad
more information than that.

183
00:07:43,174 --> 00:07:45,207
Have you heard of Liquid Water?

184
00:07:45,209 --> 00:07:49,645
Yeah, sure. Liquid Water.
"We put the I.Q. in liquid."

185
00:07:49,647 --> 00:07:51,313
You see?
You already know the client.

186
00:07:51,315 --> 00:07:52,848
- What did they do?
- They didn't do anything.

187
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:54,016
They're being accused

188
00:07:54,018 --> 00:07:55,117
of coming up with
a deceptive slogan.

189
00:07:55,119 --> 00:07:56,952
- By Durham Foods.
- Exactly.

190
00:07:56,954 --> 00:07:58,687
They have their own line
of bottled water, which,

191
00:07:58,689 --> 00:08:01,123
by the way,
tastes like a stagnant pond.

192
00:08:01,125 --> 00:08:02,691
So how do we
defend against their claim?

193
00:08:02,693 --> 00:08:04,693
Who said anything about "we,"
white man?

194
00:08:04,695 --> 00:08:06,328
My defense is puffery.

195
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:07,829
Oh, you're gonna
stick out your chest?

196
00:08:07,831 --> 00:08:09,298
No, Mike, "puffery" is...

197
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,499
A big, bold, empty statement

198
00:08:10,501 --> 00:08:12,067
not meant to be taken as fact,
therefore

199
00:08:12,069 --> 00:08:14,603
not subject to deceptive
advertising litigation.

200
00:08:14,605 --> 00:08:16,505
Touche.

201
00:08:16,507 --> 00:08:17,806
See? It's a solid case.

202
00:08:17,808 --> 00:08:20,242
I agree.
No one would actually believe

203
00:08:20,244 --> 00:08:22,511
that drinking Liquid Water
would raise your I.Q.

204
00:08:22,513 --> 00:08:24,313
I mean, who would be
that stupid?

205
00:08:24,315 --> 00:08:26,715
I mean, other than people
who actually drink...

206
00:08:26,717 --> 00:08:28,750
Liquid Water.

207
00:08:30,887 --> 00:08:32,321
You know what? Whatever.

208
00:08:32,323 --> 00:08:34,089
Just don't mention that
last part in the deposition,

209
00:08:34,091 --> 00:08:35,090
okay? Yeah, okay.

210
00:08:35,092 --> 00:08:36,625
Wait, Louis?

211
00:08:36,627 --> 00:08:39,194
Um, if we're claiming puffery,

212
00:08:39,196 --> 00:08:41,129
why do I need to waste
all my time with these motions?

213
00:08:41,131 --> 00:08:42,497
All right, let me
explain something to you.

214
00:08:42,499 --> 00:08:44,633
We're at war,
and in times of war,

215
00:08:44,635 --> 00:08:46,335
a private does not question
his commanding officer.

216
00:08:46,337 --> 00:08:48,503
If I ask you to wipe out
a village, you say, "how high?"

217
00:08:48,505 --> 00:08:49,838
- That...
- Which brings me

218
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,873
to my next point.
You report to me and me only.

219
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:53,709
You don't talk about
our business with anyone else.

220
00:08:53,711 --> 00:08:55,577
You're in by 7:00,
you're out no sooner than 10:00,

221
00:08:55,579 --> 00:08:58,180
and here's the most important
thing, no sex of any kind.

222
00:08:58,182 --> 00:08:59,915
Weakens legs,
clouds your judgment. Got it?

223
00:08:59,917 --> 00:09:01,216
- I'm not sure I do.
- Good.

224
00:09:01,218 --> 00:09:04,019
Okay.

225
00:09:04,021 --> 00:09:05,988
No sex.

226
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:08,156
No sex. Got it.

227
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:15,497
Oh, my God.

228
00:09:15,499 --> 00:09:16,832
Well?

229
00:09:16,834 --> 00:09:18,634
- Oh, my God.
- Donna,

230
00:09:18,636 --> 00:09:20,469
I need to know
if you ever saw this.

231
00:09:20,471 --> 00:09:22,738
Yes, Harvey,
I saw the smoking gun

232
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:24,539
in a multimillion-dollar
liability claim,

233
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:26,575
and I hid it from you.

234
00:09:26,577 --> 00:09:28,910
I also know where Amelia
Earhart's living, and I have

235
00:09:28,912 --> 00:09:30,646
the missing 18 minutes
from the Watergate tapes.

236
00:09:30,648 --> 00:09:31,913
All right, take it easy.

237
00:09:31,915 --> 00:09:33,749
I don't like
having my competence questioned.

238
00:09:33,751 --> 00:09:35,517
Yeah, and I don't like
being sued for fraud.

239
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:37,185
That document
never came into this office,

240
00:09:37,187 --> 00:09:38,687
or you would have seen it.

241
00:09:38,689 --> 00:09:40,722
Donna, two dozen people
worked on this case,

242
00:09:40,724 --> 00:09:42,858
and any one of them could have
seen it and missed it.

243
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:44,026
I need to know
that didn't happen,

244
00:09:44,028 --> 00:09:45,994
or I need to know who to fire.

245
00:09:45,996 --> 00:09:48,997
Give me an order.

246
00:09:48,999 --> 00:09:51,133
Go through every file
in the original case

247
00:09:51,135 --> 00:09:53,101
and make sure
that document isn't in them,

248
00:09:53,103 --> 00:09:54,670
and do it
without anyone knowing.

249
00:09:54,672 --> 00:09:57,439
Done.

250
00:10:00,176 --> 00:10:02,811
Okay, ha ha, joke's on me.

251
00:10:02,813 --> 00:10:04,313
Aren't you Louie's boy?

252
00:10:04,315 --> 00:10:06,148
Yes, I get it.
No more fondling the vinyl.

253
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:08,850
Or besmirching
the good name of the Spinners.

254
00:10:08,852 --> 00:10:11,019
Yes, I totally deserve
to be handed over

255
00:10:11,021 --> 00:10:13,155
to the poor man's Lex Luthor
for that.

256
00:10:13,157 --> 00:10:15,557
Please, Harvey,
you have to get me back.

257
00:10:15,559 --> 00:10:16,892
- Have to?
- Will you?

258
00:10:16,894 --> 00:10:18,460
He thinks we're going to war.

259
00:10:18,462 --> 00:10:21,396
He give you the
"burn down the village" speech?

260
00:10:21,398 --> 00:10:22,864
Yes. What is it with him?

261
00:10:22,866 --> 00:10:24,533
It's like the pony thing
all over again.

262
00:10:24,535 --> 00:10:26,134
He's, like, the captain
of mixed metaphors.

263
00:10:26,136 --> 00:10:28,203
Look, I can't
take you back now.

264
00:10:28,205 --> 00:10:29,905
I have to honor my bet,

265
00:10:29,907 --> 00:10:32,174
especially since
my honor's in question.

266
00:10:32,176 --> 00:10:34,509
Okay, why are you strangely
emphasizing the word "honor?"

267
00:10:34,511 --> 00:10:36,144
This letter of complaint.

268
00:10:36,146 --> 00:10:38,647
I'm being accused of fraud
by Travis Tanner.

269
00:10:38,649 --> 00:10:43,218
Isn't that like the pot
accusing the kettle of... fraud?

270
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:45,721
I'm going to the airport
to talk to CM right now.

271
00:10:45,723 --> 00:10:47,122
I'm want to reassure
Lawrence Kemp

272
00:10:47,124 --> 00:10:48,390
that we're all over this.

273
00:10:48,392 --> 00:10:49,825
Please, Harvey, come on.
Take me with you.

274
00:10:49,827 --> 00:10:51,760
I can do this.
I can work for both of you.

275
00:10:51,762 --> 00:10:53,895
It's too risky.
I'm solo on this.

276
00:10:53,897 --> 00:10:55,330
Besides, I've got

277
00:10:55,332 --> 00:10:57,733
a relationship with Kemp.
I should talk to him alone.

278
00:10:57,735 --> 00:10:59,201
Not a word to Louis.
Understand?

279
00:10:59,203 --> 00:11:01,536
Yeah. Hey, he said
that I can't have sex

280
00:11:01,538 --> 00:11:04,506
while I'm working with him.
Is that really his call?

281
00:11:04,508 --> 00:11:06,608
Well, he is
your commanding officer.

282
00:11:31,401 --> 00:11:34,202
You looking for <i>Civil Torts,</i>
<i>Volume Three?</i>

283
00:11:34,204 --> 00:11:36,071
People put that in criminal law.
I hate that.

284
00:11:36,073 --> 00:11:37,406
Yeah, I know. Me too.

285
00:11:37,408 --> 00:11:39,708
Oh, I knew we had something
in common.

286
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:41,143
You need my help?

287
00:11:41,145 --> 00:11:43,745
Ah no, I've actually
got it right... there.

288
00:11:43,747 --> 00:11:46,314
I'm sorry.
I was just trying to help you.

289
00:11:46,316 --> 00:11:49,217
Harold, you're the associate,
and I'm the paralegal.

290
00:11:49,219 --> 00:11:51,820
It's my job to help you,
not the other way around.

291
00:11:51,822 --> 00:11:53,688
I don't see us that way.

292
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:57,058
Okay, um, you want to help me?
My... my stapler is broken.

293
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:58,126
Could you get me a new one?

294
00:11:58,128 --> 00:11:59,494
I'll get you three.

295
00:11:59,496 --> 00:12:01,096
Harold.

296
00:12:06,636 --> 00:12:10,839
Thank you.

297
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:15,010
Good to see you, Lawrence.

298
00:12:15,012 --> 00:12:16,077
Harvey, good to see you.

299
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:17,245
Sorry this had to be
on the fly.

300
00:12:17,247 --> 00:12:18,880
It's not a problem.

301
00:12:18,882 --> 00:12:20,415
I want to start
by giving you my word

302
00:12:20,417 --> 00:12:23,118
that we crushed this suit once,
we're gonna to crush it again.

303
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,453
I should hope so.

304
00:12:24,455 --> 00:12:26,488
I was hoping to have
this discussion privately.

305
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:29,157
Well, this is our new
general counsel, Matt Lasker.

306
00:12:29,159 --> 00:12:30,992
He insisted on being
part of the discussion.

307
00:12:30,994 --> 00:12:32,661
Forgive me,
I'm just getting up to speed.

308
00:12:32,663 --> 00:12:34,129
- Then you should know that...
- Out of curiosity,

309
00:12:34,131 --> 00:12:35,864
why did you receive
a draft of the complaint

310
00:12:35,866 --> 00:12:38,733
before we did, Mr. Specter?

311
00:12:38,735 --> 00:12:41,136
Travis Tanner gave me
an advanced copy.

312
00:12:41,138 --> 00:12:42,304
Must like you.

313
00:12:42,306 --> 00:12:44,005
We have a special relationship.

314
00:12:44,007 --> 00:12:45,807
- Which I've looked into.
- Harvey,

315
00:12:45,809 --> 00:12:47,876
he really seems to have
a bone to pick with you.

316
00:12:47,878 --> 00:12:48,877
That's not gonna be a problem.

317
00:12:48,879 --> 00:12:51,580
May be for us.

318
00:12:53,749 --> 00:12:56,218
Tanner came to see you,
didn't he?

319
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:58,386
- At our request.
- Lawrence, I'm telling you,

320
00:12:58,388 --> 00:12:59,421
we can handle this.

321
00:12:59,423 --> 00:13:01,490
We just need to stick together.

322
00:13:01,492 --> 00:13:04,659
Look, if I'm going to defend us
against this suit...

323
00:13:04,661 --> 00:13:08,129
"If" being the operative word.

324
00:13:08,131 --> 00:13:10,499
A-am I being fired?

325
00:13:10,501 --> 00:13:12,467
Ww... we're keeping you
on retainer

326
00:13:12,469 --> 00:13:14,169
while we evaluate our options.

327
00:13:14,171 --> 00:13:16,238
Don't you see, Tanner's trying
to put a wedge between us?

328
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,607
What Lawrence is reluctant
to tell you is,

329
00:13:18,609 --> 00:13:20,208
your relationship with this man

330
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:22,110
has put us
directly in his crosshairs.

331
00:13:22,112 --> 00:13:24,379
There is a wedge between us.

332
00:13:24,381 --> 00:13:26,715
Maybe Lawrence's reluctance
stems from the fact

333
00:13:26,717 --> 00:13:28,783
that I also have
a relationship with him.

334
00:13:28,785 --> 00:13:31,586
Harvey, I have
a corporate responsibility here.

335
00:13:31,588 --> 00:13:33,722
Well, while you're evaluating
your options,

336
00:13:33,724 --> 00:13:35,991
why don't you think about
who was there for your company

337
00:13:35,993 --> 00:13:39,194
four years ago and what happened
to your stock price after I won.

338
00:13:39,196 --> 00:13:40,762
Oh, you got paid
very well for that.

339
00:13:40,764 --> 00:13:41,796
As were you.

340
00:13:41,798 --> 00:13:43,899
You had a huge bonus that year,

341
00:13:43,901 --> 00:13:46,134
and I don't actually
recall it ever going back down.

342
00:13:46,136 --> 00:13:47,402
There's no need
to get personal.

343
00:13:47,404 --> 00:13:49,104
You... our asses
are on the line,

344
00:13:49,106 --> 00:13:51,039
and you're trying
to cut me loose... it's personal.

345
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:52,874
- Harvey...
- Save the "it's not you,"

346
00:13:52,876 --> 00:13:56,645
"it's me" speech, okay?
Be a man and make a clean break.

347
00:13:56,647 --> 00:13:57,979
- Fine.
- No.

348
00:13:57,981 --> 00:13:59,314
You're fired.

349
00:13:59,316 --> 00:14:02,050
He's on record.

350
00:14:08,391 --> 00:14:10,158
Remember I told you it was

351
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,060
to work with me and Louis
at the same time?

352
00:14:12,062 --> 00:14:13,495
Yes.

353
00:14:13,497 --> 00:14:15,030
We have to take that risk.

354
00:14:15,032 --> 00:14:17,432
I need you to go through
every file in this case.

355
00:14:17,434 --> 00:14:19,267
You mean you want me to find
what you missed?

356
00:14:19,269 --> 00:14:20,869
I didn't miss anything.

357
00:14:20,871 --> 00:14:22,704
I need you to go through
those files

358
00:14:22,706 --> 00:14:26,775
and tell me what's not in there.
Shit, I gotta go.

359
00:14:28,578 --> 00:14:29,778
What happened?

360
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:32,180
Well, I got good news
and bad news.

361
00:14:32,182 --> 00:14:34,616
- What's the bad news?
- I got us fired.

362
00:14:34,618 --> 00:14:35,650
What's the good news?

363
00:14:35,652 --> 00:14:37,819
Anything we find
from here on out

364
00:14:37,821 --> 00:14:40,255
is no longer covered
by attorney client privilege.

365
00:14:49,797 --> 00:14:51,331
Did you find
what you're not looking for?

366
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:53,233
No, did you find
what you're not looking for?

367
00:14:53,235 --> 00:14:55,936
Nope. Oh, my God,
it is so stuffy in here.

368
00:14:55,938 --> 00:14:58,338
What are the symptoms
of carbon dioxide poisoning?

369
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:01,475
Uh, headaches, dizziness,
mental confusion,

370
00:15:01,477 --> 00:15:03,310
mental confusion.

371
00:15:05,814 --> 00:15:07,180
Kevin, trusts and estates?

372
00:15:07,182 --> 00:15:09,416
No, it's too meek.
It's gotta be a woman.

373
00:15:09,418 --> 00:15:10,684
Who is it?

374
00:15:10,686 --> 00:15:13,353
- Harold. I need a stapler.
- I was right.

375
00:15:13,355 --> 00:15:14,554
Okay, there are files
everywhere.

376
00:15:14,556 --> 00:15:15,622
He's gonna be suspicious.
What do we do?

377
00:15:15,624 --> 00:15:16,890
Don't worry, I got it.

378
00:15:16,892 --> 00:15:17,891
I got th... what are you-?

379
00:15:17,893 --> 00:15:18,925
Come here.

380
00:15:18,927 --> 00:15:20,027
Ow! Oh, come on, you pussy.

381
00:15:20,029 --> 00:15:21,228
- Ow. Okay, what are you...?
- Shh.

382
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:23,030
What's going on?

383
00:15:23,032 --> 00:15:25,032
Come in.

384
00:15:27,535 --> 00:15:30,303
Hi, Harold, honey.

385
00:15:30,305 --> 00:15:31,872
Is this why it says,
"Do not enter?"

386
00:15:31,874 --> 00:15:34,007
We're kind of busy in here.
Do you mind if, um...

387
00:15:34,009 --> 00:15:35,208
You know,

388
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:36,443
you just don't bother us
anymore?

389
00:15:36,445 --> 00:15:38,412
Sure. No problem.

390
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:43,850
Yeah, he didn't notice
the files.

391
00:15:43,852 --> 00:15:47,454
Oh, sh..., I'm late for
Louie's settlement conference.

392
00:15:47,456 --> 00:15:51,358
Uh, and... thanks.

393
00:15:52,927 --> 00:15:54,327
You're welcome.

394
00:15:54,329 --> 00:15:56,096
And then I take the shuttle
to Grand Central,

395
00:15:56,098 --> 00:15:57,464
and then I take the local
from there.

396
00:15:57,466 --> 00:16:00,133
I think you'll find that...
pleasurable, actually.

397
00:16:00,135 --> 00:16:01,535
Sorry, restroom.

398
00:16:01,537 --> 00:16:03,904
No, that's okay.
This is my associate, Mike Ross.

399
00:16:03,906 --> 00:16:07,274
He was busy, uh, drafting
some pertinent documents.

400
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:12,279
Motion to dismiss,
motion to compel,

401
00:16:12,281 --> 00:16:15,382
motion to strike,
motion to change venue,

402
00:16:15,384 --> 00:16:17,250
and we have another half dozen
in the pipeline.

403
00:16:17,252 --> 00:16:19,019
- No, they're here.
- Oh.

404
00:16:19,021 --> 00:16:20,220
What is this?

405
00:16:20,222 --> 00:16:21,922
This was supposed to be
a settlement conference.

406
00:16:21,924 --> 00:16:24,224
Oh, we're not here to settle.
We're proceeding to trial.

407
00:16:24,226 --> 00:16:26,126
You want to take this case
to trial?

408
00:16:26,128 --> 00:16:29,930
Um, unless I can't hear
the sound of my own voice,

409
00:16:29,932 --> 00:16:31,598
I believe that's
what I just frickin' said.

410
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,633
We're the little guy.

411
00:16:33,635 --> 00:16:36,470
Your parent company's
a behemoth.

412
00:16:36,472 --> 00:16:37,838
A jury's gonna hate you.

413
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,372
Well, thanks to your
disgusting smears in the media,

414
00:16:39,374 --> 00:16:40,841
that might be true,

415
00:16:40,843 --> 00:16:43,410
which is why we're also filing
a countersuit for libel,

416
00:16:43,412 --> 00:16:45,812
slander, and anything else
that might be appropriate

417
00:16:45,814 --> 00:16:49,082
in this case.
Tortious interference?

418
00:16:49,084 --> 00:16:51,284
This is... you got... this is not
good faith, Mr. Litt.

419
00:16:51,286 --> 00:16:53,620
Sir, you have besmirched
the good name of Liquid Water,

420
00:16:53,622 --> 00:16:56,089
and if you think that we're here
for a settlement conference,

421
00:16:56,091 --> 00:16:57,924
well, let me just correct
that one for you right now.

422
00:16:57,926 --> 00:17:00,694
We are not settling.
We will not be settling.

423
00:17:00,696 --> 00:17:02,996
In fact, the only thing
that's settling here

424
00:17:02,998 --> 00:17:06,500
is the sediment at the bottom
of your putrid water. Get me?

425
00:17:06,502 --> 00:17:08,201
Now be sure to take
that Grand Central shuttle

426
00:17:08,203 --> 00:17:11,138
like I told you, okay?
I think you're gonna love it.

427
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:13,540
- Uh, that was...
- Amazing? I know.

428
00:17:13,542 --> 00:17:16,476
- I'm sorry, Louis, that I, uh...
- Questioned my orders? I know.

429
00:17:16,478 --> 00:17:18,145
I thought it was
just busy work.

430
00:17:18,147 --> 00:17:20,380
Well, it wasn't. For every
hour you spent drafting them,

431
00:17:20,382 --> 00:17:21,681
they're gonna spend ten hours

432
00:17:21,683 --> 00:17:23,717
figuring out
how to argue it back in court.

433
00:17:23,719 --> 00:17:25,452
You're gonna bury them
in paperwork.

434
00:17:25,454 --> 00:17:26,987
Look at you.

435
00:17:26,989 --> 00:17:29,289
You catch on quick.
What happens next?

436
00:17:29,291 --> 00:17:31,558
They squirm for a day or two,
reevaluate,

437
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,160
and come back to us
on our terms.

438
00:17:33,162 --> 00:17:35,762
Like... tomorrow, maybe?

439
00:17:35,764 --> 00:17:37,697
Tomo...

440
00:17:37,699 --> 00:17:40,867
Mike. Sweet,
impressionable, young Mike.

441
00:17:40,869 --> 00:17:42,068
You see,
unlike what Harvey believes,

442
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:43,737
going to trial is a good thing,

443
00:17:43,739 --> 00:17:45,639
especially when the other side
can't afford it.

444
00:17:45,641 --> 00:17:47,874
Durham Foods,
their financials are soft,

445
00:17:47,876 --> 00:17:49,242
but it's gonna take a trial
to put 'em down,

446
00:17:49,244 --> 00:17:50,443
so you better
lace up your bootstraps

447
00:17:50,445 --> 00:17:51,545
'cause this battle
could take months.

448
00:17:55,583 --> 00:17:57,717
Uh, where you going?

449
00:17:57,719 --> 00:17:59,619
Uh, I just have to go back...

450
00:17:59,621 --> 00:18:01,321
to, uh, the bathroom.

451
00:18:01,323 --> 00:18:02,522
You just went.

452
00:18:02,524 --> 00:18:03,890
Are you keeping track?

453
00:18:03,892 --> 00:18:06,660
I may start.

454
00:18:11,699 --> 00:18:14,067
I don't mean to intrude,
but Donna's not at her desk.

455
00:18:14,069 --> 00:18:16,069
Do you have a minute?

456
00:18:17,438 --> 00:18:20,774
I overstepped last week.
I want to make up for it.

457
00:18:20,776 --> 00:18:22,175
It's not necessary, Daniel.

458
00:18:22,177 --> 00:18:24,244
Pfister Insurance. I thought

459
00:18:24,246 --> 00:18:27,714
maybe we could handle them
together.

460
00:18:27,716 --> 00:18:30,550
I'm gonna to have
to take a rain check.

461
00:18:30,552 --> 00:18:32,586
It's a peace offering, Harvey.
Take it.

462
00:18:32,588 --> 00:18:34,154
You know, I'm sorry,

463
00:18:34,156 --> 00:18:36,857
but my plate's just
a little full at the moment.

464
00:18:36,859 --> 00:18:38,491
Do you mind if I ask with what?

465
00:18:38,493 --> 00:18:40,727
Uh, the usual.
I have six situations,

466
00:18:40,729 --> 00:18:42,195
all in need
of immediate attention.

467
00:18:42,197 --> 00:18:45,699
Which begs the question,
why not add one more?

468
00:18:48,436 --> 00:18:51,438
I'll see if I can free up
some time next week, okay?

469
00:18:57,011 --> 00:18:59,913
Um... I think
I didn't find something.

470
00:18:59,915 --> 00:19:02,082
Let me not have it then.

471
00:19:02,084 --> 00:19:04,985
During the two years
before our car was manufactured,

472
00:19:04,987 --> 00:19:07,087
there was this mid-level
quality control manager

473
00:19:07,089 --> 00:19:09,256
named Sarah Layton,
who wrote several reports

474
00:19:09,258 --> 00:19:11,925
on other CM car models
but never on ours.

475
00:19:11,927 --> 00:19:13,860
So she's not relevant
to our case.

476
00:19:13,862 --> 00:19:17,264
It would appear that way,
but after May 5th, 2006,

477
00:19:17,266 --> 00:19:19,299
she never wrote
another report ever again.

478
00:19:19,301 --> 00:19:20,867
That's kind of a coincidence,
isn't it?

479
00:19:20,869 --> 00:19:23,503
That on the exact date that
our car went into production,

480
00:19:23,505 --> 00:19:25,338
she disappeared
from CM's records?

481
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:26,573
She could've just been fired.

482
00:19:26,575 --> 00:19:27,741
Never filed for unemployment.

483
00:19:27,743 --> 00:19:31,077
- Could've quit.
- No exit interview.

484
00:19:31,079 --> 00:19:32,178
Permanent unpaid leave.

485
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:33,613
Gets out of any records.

486
00:19:33,615 --> 00:19:35,115
And nothing to tie her
to our car.

487
00:19:35,117 --> 00:19:36,349
She wrote that memo.

488
00:19:36,351 --> 00:19:37,884
- Very smart.
- Thank you.

489
00:19:37,886 --> 00:19:39,185
I meant them, not you.

490
00:19:39,187 --> 00:19:41,488
But I found it.
That makes me even smarter.

491
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:43,456
Don't be cocky.
It's unbecoming.

492
00:19:43,458 --> 00:19:46,192
On you. I can pull it off.

493
00:19:46,194 --> 00:19:48,962
You better be nice to me
because I know where she lives.

494
00:19:50,298 --> 00:19:51,731
Where who lives?

495
00:19:51,733 --> 00:19:52,999
My high school sweetheart.
We connected on Facebook.

496
00:19:53,001 --> 00:19:55,435
Oh. Bullshit,
you're not that sentimental.

497
00:19:55,437 --> 00:19:57,671
- Yes, I am.
- She was his first.

498
00:19:58,706 --> 00:20:02,509
Deposition tomorrow. Be ready.

499
00:20:05,112 --> 00:20:07,714
- First?
- I had to sell it.

500
00:20:07,716 --> 00:20:09,482
Give me the address
and tell Donna to hurry up.

501
00:20:09,484 --> 00:20:12,218
I'm naked to the world
down here.

502
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:14,554
Harvey, there is one problem.

503
00:20:14,556 --> 00:20:16,790
If this woman was involved
in the original cover-up,

504
00:20:16,792 --> 00:20:18,191
she's not gonna want
to talk to a lawyer

505
00:20:18,193 --> 00:20:19,626
who isn't on her side anymore.

506
00:20:19,628 --> 00:20:22,162
Well, I better think of
something on my way down there.

507
00:20:29,303 --> 00:20:31,504
I went to the file room
to get you the good stapler,

508
00:20:31,506 --> 00:20:32,973
but there was a bit of a snafu.

509
00:20:32,975 --> 00:20:35,475
- In the file room?
- I don't want to get into it.

510
00:20:35,477 --> 00:20:39,012
In the meantime, I brought you
my own personal stapler,

511
00:20:39,014 --> 00:20:41,815
a two-hole punch, three-hole
punch, old-school wite-out,

512
00:20:41,817 --> 00:20:43,950
and enough highlighters
to last you till kingdom come.

513
00:20:43,952 --> 00:20:45,318
Look, Harold, I-I know

514
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:47,687
that you don't see us
as paralegal and associate,

515
00:20:47,689 --> 00:20:49,823
but I think it's best
from now on

516
00:20:49,825 --> 00:20:52,459
that I just help you.

517
00:20:52,461 --> 00:20:54,394
Because the truth...
the truth is,

518
00:20:54,396 --> 00:20:58,465
you are far too valuable
to be wasting your time on this.

519
00:20:58,467 --> 00:21:01,101
I am?

520
00:21:01,103 --> 00:21:02,535
You're right. Yeah.

521
00:21:02,537 --> 00:21:04,270
And besides, you probably
don't want all this stuff,

522
00:21:04,272 --> 00:21:05,405
anyway. Well, there's that.

523
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:06,740
Except for the stapler,
of course.

524
00:21:06,742 --> 00:21:09,242
You got it. Of course.
Thank you.

525
00:21:27,695 --> 00:21:29,696
Sarah Layton?

526
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:33,033
You recognize me.

527
00:21:33,035 --> 00:21:34,601
I do.

528
00:21:34,603 --> 00:21:37,270
Then you know who I work for.

529
00:21:37,272 --> 00:21:38,538
Coastal Motors.

530
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:40,707
I'm not gonna deny that.

531
00:21:42,743 --> 00:21:43,810
What do you want?

532
00:21:43,812 --> 00:21:45,578
We have a problem.

533
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:49,682
I need you to tell me everyone
you've ever shown this to.

534
00:21:54,555 --> 00:21:55,789
I never showed it to anyone.

535
00:21:55,791 --> 00:21:58,058
Ms. Layton,
I don't care that you wrote it.

536
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:59,759
You made a deal
to keep your mouth shut,

537
00:21:59,761 --> 00:22:00,994
and I believe you kept it.

538
00:22:00,996 --> 00:22:02,529
All I care about
is who else read it.

539
00:22:02,531 --> 00:22:05,098
I don't know
who else read it...

540
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,366
'Cause I didn't write it.

541
00:22:06,368 --> 00:22:07,767
- Ms. Layton...
- I brought my concerns

542
00:22:07,769 --> 00:22:09,269
to Mr. Kemp.

543
00:22:09,271 --> 00:22:11,571
He told me not to put anything
in writing, and I never did.

544
00:22:11,573 --> 00:22:13,506
Good.

545
00:22:13,508 --> 00:22:14,908
I need you to swear to me

546
00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:16,976
that you never told anyone

547
00:22:16,978 --> 00:22:19,112
other than Lawrence Kemp
about the flaws in his hood.

548
00:22:19,114 --> 00:22:21,915
You listen to me.

549
00:22:21,917 --> 00:22:23,983
He promised he'd fix
the problems on the line

550
00:22:23,985 --> 00:22:26,386
if I kept quiet. He did,

551
00:22:26,388 --> 00:22:29,823
but he never went back and fixed
the ones we already made,

552
00:22:29,825 --> 00:22:31,424
and that man died.

553
00:22:31,426 --> 00:22:35,028
I have been living with that
ever since.

554
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:38,898
Now get off my property,
and leave me the hell alone.

555
00:22:54,516 --> 00:22:57,083
Furniture salesman
to limo driver.

556
00:22:57,085 --> 00:22:58,685
You're stepping up
in the world.

557
00:22:58,687 --> 00:23:00,487
Well, it's nice to know
you still have a sense of humor,

558
00:23:00,489 --> 00:23:03,022
Harvey, considering you just
learned you defended a murderer.

559
00:23:03,024 --> 00:23:05,525
I should've known
you'd have me followed.

560
00:23:05,527 --> 00:23:08,294
Follow you?
I've been waiting for you.

561
00:23:08,296 --> 00:23:10,430
I told you,
you're on the wrong side.

562
00:23:10,432 --> 00:23:11,698
I don't defend murderers.

563
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:14,834
That's not
what that woman just told you.

564
00:23:14,836 --> 00:23:17,070
You wanted me to find her.

565
00:23:17,072 --> 00:23:20,173
You have the document.
No proof of fraud.

566
00:23:20,175 --> 00:23:22,275
Can't admit it without fraud.

567
00:23:22,277 --> 00:23:24,010
Now that you know
Kemp lied on the stand...

568
00:23:24,012 --> 00:23:26,679
I'm obligated to come forward
and tell the court. Otherwise...

569
00:23:26,681 --> 00:23:29,149
Even if you weren't
guilty of fraud then,

570
00:23:29,151 --> 00:23:30,817
you'll be guilty of fraud now.

571
00:23:30,819 --> 00:23:32,318
Of course,
when you do come forward,

572
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,887
it's going to be awfully hard
for people to believe

573
00:23:33,889 --> 00:23:35,355
you didn't know about it
at the time.

574
00:23:35,357 --> 00:23:36,689
You know I didn't know.

575
00:23:36,691 --> 00:23:38,291
I don't know
anything of the kind.

576
00:23:38,293 --> 00:23:41,861
What I do know is,
you're in a bind.

577
00:23:42,897 --> 00:23:44,564
I wouldn't wait too long now.

578
00:23:44,566 --> 00:23:47,300
I'd hate to have to report you
to the bar.

579
00:23:58,878 --> 00:24:00,711
Lawrence goddamn Kemp.

580
00:24:00,713 --> 00:24:02,846
Harvey, I need this suit
quashed, and I need it done now,

581
00:24:02,848 --> 00:24:06,283
so channel your anger
and find a way out.

582
00:24:06,285 --> 00:24:08,352
I mean, I knew I had an enemy
in Tanner, but...

583
00:24:08,354 --> 00:24:10,721
Did you ever think that
the person you should be mad at

584
00:24:10,723 --> 00:24:12,289
is yourself? Excuse me?

585
00:24:12,291 --> 00:24:13,924
Law 101.

586
00:24:13,926 --> 00:24:15,626
Don't ask your client
if he committed murder,

587
00:24:15,628 --> 00:24:17,961
but sure as hell find out
if there's a smoking gun.

588
00:24:17,963 --> 00:24:20,464
Jessica, I'm sorry,
I wasn't born yesterday,

589
00:24:20,466 --> 00:24:23,100
but he swore to me there was
nothing wrong with that car,

590
00:24:23,102 --> 00:24:24,101
and I believed him.

591
00:24:24,103 --> 00:24:25,669
Well, he lied to you.

592
00:24:25,671 --> 00:24:28,305
It's not the first time,
and it won't be the last,

593
00:24:28,307 --> 00:24:30,574
but now Tanner knows it.

594
00:24:30,576 --> 00:24:31,942
I guess
it's time to tell Daniel.

595
00:24:31,944 --> 00:24:33,443
What? Now? No.

596
00:24:33,445 --> 00:24:35,512
I just had the chance
to tell him, and I didn't.

597
00:24:35,514 --> 00:24:37,147
- Why not?
- Because you told me not to.

598
00:24:37,149 --> 00:24:38,949
The one time you listen to me.

599
00:24:38,951 --> 00:24:40,517
No, no, no, no.
You can't lay into me

600
00:24:40,519 --> 00:24:42,920
every time I go against you
and then flip it around now.

601
00:24:42,922 --> 00:24:45,189
We're not telling.
I'm gonna fix it.

602
00:24:45,191 --> 00:24:47,291
Well, the one way to fix it
is to negotiate a settlement.

603
00:24:47,293 --> 00:24:50,460
Oh, wait, we can't
because you got us fired.

604
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:54,531
I did, which means
there's nothing stopping us

605
00:24:54,533 --> 00:24:55,899
from strong-arming them.

606
00:24:55,901 --> 00:24:59,002
I gotta go.

607
00:24:59,004 --> 00:25:01,171
Just admit it.
Your research suggests

608
00:25:01,173 --> 00:25:04,575
that consumers believe
your water tastes like shit.

609
00:25:04,577 --> 00:25:05,909
Do I have to answer that?

610
00:25:05,911 --> 00:25:07,344
What exactly
are you getting at, Mr. Litt?

611
00:25:07,346 --> 00:25:09,479
What I'm getting at is,
Mr. Kessler is aware of the fact

612
00:25:09,481 --> 00:25:12,049
that his company's product
can't compete with ours

613
00:25:12,051 --> 00:25:13,383
'cause it tastes like shit,

614
00:25:13,385 --> 00:25:15,786
and they resorted
to filing a bogus lawsuit

615
00:25:15,788 --> 00:25:18,188
against us in a desperate
attempt to hide that fact.

616
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:20,791
No, you don't
have to answer that.

617
00:25:20,793 --> 00:25:22,259
Hey, Mike...

618
00:25:22,261 --> 00:25:24,761
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

619
00:25:24,763 --> 00:25:26,430
Kevin, right?

620
00:25:26,432 --> 00:25:27,965
How long have you
worked at Durham Foods?

621
00:25:27,967 --> 00:25:30,434
22 years.
I started right out of college.

622
00:25:30,436 --> 00:25:31,668
That's dedication.

623
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:34,037
I admire that.

624
00:25:34,039 --> 00:25:35,606
What's your current title?

625
00:25:35,608 --> 00:25:37,441
Vice president
of Market Research.

626
00:25:37,443 --> 00:25:38,775
It says here, three years ago,

627
00:25:38,777 --> 00:25:41,511
you applied
for senior vice president,

628
00:25:41,513 --> 00:25:45,182
but they gave the job
to an Alan Stansby instead,

629
00:25:45,184 --> 00:25:47,918
a man who had been at the
company far shorter than you.

630
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,152
Correct.

631
00:25:49,154 --> 00:25:50,153
Well, how'd that make you feel?

632
00:25:50,155 --> 00:25:51,388
Yes or no questions.

633
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:52,689
My client's not here
to discuss feelings.

634
00:25:52,691 --> 00:25:54,725
Okay, truthfully,
you were hoping to be

635
00:25:54,727 --> 00:25:57,661
further up the corporate ladder
by now, weren't you?

636
00:25:57,663 --> 00:25:59,730
Maybe.

637
00:25:59,732 --> 00:26:01,031
Thank you, Mike.

638
00:26:01,033 --> 00:26:02,266
And once again,

639
00:26:02,268 --> 00:26:05,335
recently you applied
for a senior VP position

640
00:26:05,337 --> 00:26:07,371
and were turned down.
Is that correct?

641
00:26:07,373 --> 00:26:08,839
- Yes.
- You do know that

642
00:26:08,841 --> 00:26:11,708
management is going outside the
company to fill the job, right?

643
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:13,477
Objection. Lack of foundation.

644
00:26:13,479 --> 00:26:14,478
You know what?
I am so sorry. That was...

645
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,912
that's off the record.

646
00:26:15,914 --> 00:26:17,114
That's just because of
a headhunter friend of mine...

647
00:26:17,116 --> 00:26:18,515
That's not... no,
we object to that too.

648
00:26:18,517 --> 00:26:19,583
I'm warning you, Mr. Litt.

649
00:26:19,585 --> 00:26:22,586
I'm sorry. Statement withdrawn.

650
00:26:24,656 --> 00:26:29,593
You know, you can tow
the party line, Kevin...

651
00:26:29,595 --> 00:26:33,530
but I know exactly

652
00:26:33,532 --> 00:26:36,366
what it's like to bust your ass
every day at a company

653
00:26:36,368 --> 00:26:39,036
and be overlooked for
a promotion time and time again.

654
00:26:39,038 --> 00:26:42,539
It just...

655
00:26:42,541 --> 00:26:44,274
hurts.

656
00:26:44,276 --> 00:26:47,444
Just physically hurts.

657
00:26:47,446 --> 00:26:49,646
Right here.

658
00:26:49,648 --> 00:26:53,817
Give 110% every day,
and for what?

659
00:26:53,819 --> 00:26:58,722
So they can just...
chip away at your dignity?

660
00:26:58,724 --> 00:27:02,726
You can be the, uh,
loyal soldier today,

661
00:27:02,728 --> 00:27:08,098
be the cannon fodder
for your bosses,

662
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:10,200
or you can turn the guns on 'em
right now,

663
00:27:10,202 --> 00:27:11,368
and you can just
tell me the truth.

664
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:12,436
We're done here.

665
00:27:12,438 --> 00:27:14,004
- It's true.
- Kevin.

666
00:27:14,006 --> 00:27:15,672
- Our product sucks.
- No, objection.

667
00:27:15,674 --> 00:27:17,174
You can't object
to your own witness.

668
00:27:17,176 --> 00:27:18,208
We're suing 'cause
we're losing market share.

669
00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:19,476
- Kevin.
- There's nothing wrong

670
00:27:19,478 --> 00:27:24,381
with your ad campaign,
and that's the truth.

671
00:27:24,383 --> 00:27:26,249
Thank you, Kevin.

672
00:27:28,186 --> 00:27:31,088
Uh, Louis, that was awesome.

673
00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:32,155
That was pretty spectacular,
wasn't it?

674
00:27:32,157 --> 00:27:33,724
His testimony
is gonna be amazing.

675
00:27:33,726 --> 00:27:35,625
I got him to admit
some damning things, didn't I?

676
00:27:35,627 --> 00:27:37,461
You know, we should subpoena
the outside company

677
00:27:37,463 --> 00:27:38,595
that put together
the focus groups.

678
00:27:38,597 --> 00:27:39,629
- Yes.
- We should get

679
00:27:39,631 --> 00:27:41,131
all their records... Like it.

680
00:27:41,133 --> 00:27:42,399
And the names and addresses
of the people who took part.

681
00:27:42,401 --> 00:27:43,867
They're protected
in civil actions

682
00:27:43,869 --> 00:27:45,402
under the privacy statute
of '74.

683
00:27:45,404 --> 00:27:47,371
No, that was overturned
by Kressler v. Symtech.

684
00:27:47,373 --> 00:27:49,039
Not if they'd been compensated,

685
00:27:49,041 --> 00:27:50,240
as is this case right here.

686
00:27:50,242 --> 00:27:51,775
We're gonna win this thing.

687
00:27:51,777 --> 00:27:54,544
"If I can't win, I won't run."

688
00:27:54,546 --> 00:27:55,846
- What?
- "If I can't win,

689
00:27:55,848 --> 00:27:57,647
I won't ru..."
that's <i>Chariots of Fire.</i>

690
00:27:57,649 --> 00:27:59,783
Come on. Do you... don't tell me
you don't know that film.

691
00:27:59,785 --> 00:28:01,351
You know,
like what you and Harvey do,

692
00:28:01,353 --> 00:28:02,386
the... the movie quotes.

693
00:28:02,388 --> 00:28:03,587
I forgot. It's... yeah.

694
00:28:03,589 --> 00:28:05,055
Well, it's been a long time
since I saw it,

695
00:28:05,057 --> 00:28:06,390
you know. It's a great,
great flick though.

696
00:28:06,392 --> 00:28:07,791
Yeah.

697
00:28:07,793 --> 00:28:09,226
Anyway, all right. So, um,

698
00:28:09,228 --> 00:28:12,763
make sure the subpoenas
are on my desk in the morning.

699
00:28:12,765 --> 00:28:14,898
Oh, Mike, uh,

700
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:17,901
make it the afternoon
'cause you've earned it.

701
00:28:24,409 --> 00:28:26,410
Good night, Tommy.

702
00:28:30,014 --> 00:28:31,782
Lawrence, what a coincidence,

703
00:28:31,784 --> 00:28:33,617
me running into you
in your own building.

704
00:28:33,619 --> 00:28:34,785
I certainly
wasn't waiting for you.

705
00:28:34,787 --> 00:28:36,353
Harvey.

706
00:28:36,355 --> 00:28:37,587
Ah, it's better this way.

707
00:28:37,589 --> 00:28:39,456
Your new lawyer
won't hear what I have to say

708
00:28:39,458 --> 00:28:41,391
and be put in a position
to commit fraud,

709
00:28:41,393 --> 00:28:43,794
like you did to me.

710
00:28:43,796 --> 00:28:46,663
I don't know what you think
you know, but it's wrong.

711
00:28:46,665 --> 00:28:49,666
I know about Sarah Layton.

712
00:28:54,305 --> 00:28:57,007
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

713
00:28:57,009 --> 00:29:00,911
But whatever you know, Harvey,
is privileged information.

714
00:29:00,913 --> 00:29:03,814
Not if I found out yesterday,
and definitely not

715
00:29:03,816 --> 00:29:05,816
if you conspired
for me to commit fraud.

716
00:29:05,818 --> 00:29:07,017
There's no fraud.

717
00:29:07,019 --> 00:29:08,752
She found a problem,
and you tried to...

718
00:29:08,754 --> 00:29:11,087
And I fixed it,
and there's no record!

719
00:29:11,089 --> 00:29:13,123
That's what a solid front end

720
00:29:13,125 --> 00:29:15,459
feels like,
but you didn't make one,

721
00:29:15,461 --> 00:29:18,261
so when Frank Randall's car
hit the divider

722
00:29:18,263 --> 00:29:20,330
at 50 times the force
that you just felt,

723
00:29:20,332 --> 00:29:22,332
it crumpled
and split him in half.

724
00:29:22,334 --> 00:29:23,867
Then I savaged his reputation,

725
00:29:23,869 --> 00:29:25,469
all because
you looked me in the eye

726
00:29:25,471 --> 00:29:27,771
and told me that your hood
was rock solid.

727
00:29:27,773 --> 00:29:31,341
What do you want, Harvey?

728
00:29:31,343 --> 00:29:33,143
What you should have done
in the first place.

729
00:29:33,145 --> 00:29:36,313
Pay these people
and make this thing go away.

730
00:29:36,315 --> 00:29:38,348
If you don't,
I'm coming forward

731
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:40,951
and telling the court
what I know.

732
00:29:40,953 --> 00:29:45,055
Even if I didn't want to,
I'd have to, but I want to,

733
00:29:45,057 --> 00:29:48,158
and when I do, Coastal Motors
is gonna cut you loose

734
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,926
exactly the same way
you did to me,

735
00:29:49,928 --> 00:29:53,129
so either you make it right
on your own, or I will.

736
00:29:58,024 --> 00:29:59,392
Hey, I got the subpoenas.

737
00:29:59,482 --> 00:30:00,848
I said the afternoon.

738
00:30:00,850 --> 00:30:02,816
It's the first thing
in the morning.

739
00:30:02,818 --> 00:30:04,251
War doesn't wait
for the afternoon.

740
00:30:04,253 --> 00:30:07,421
Sweeter words
have never been spoken.

741
00:30:07,423 --> 00:30:10,624
Gentlemen,
before you do any more work,

742
00:30:10,626 --> 00:30:12,226
Durham Foods
is declaring bankruptcy.

743
00:30:12,228 --> 00:30:13,794
- Yes.
- Damn.

744
00:30:13,796 --> 00:30:15,696
- Damn? We win.
- No, now if there's a judgment

745
00:30:15,698 --> 00:30:16,964
on the countersuit,
we're gonna be

746
00:30:16,966 --> 00:30:18,832
in the back of the line
behind a dozen lenders.

747
00:30:18,834 --> 00:30:21,935
Sorry. I know you've been
working on this for weeks.

748
00:30:23,138 --> 00:30:26,840
Uh, yeah. Yeah, well,
what are you gonna do?

749
00:30:31,179 --> 00:30:32,546
We can still get a win-win out
of this whole thing.

750
00:30:32,548 --> 00:30:33,881
- How?
- Well, you said that

751
00:30:33,883 --> 00:30:36,016
their other products are
worth real money, right?

752
00:30:36,018 --> 00:30:38,252
So why don't we just
advise Liquid Water

753
00:30:38,254 --> 00:30:41,455
to buy the whole company
and then just give up the suit?

754
00:30:41,457 --> 00:30:43,390
We kill the competition
and get their other products

755
00:30:43,392 --> 00:30:45,058
at a discount to market value.

756
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:48,061
- Win.
- Win.

757
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:01,375
Why'd you cover for me?

758
00:31:01,377 --> 00:31:02,376
What do you mean?

759
00:31:02,378 --> 00:31:04,244
With Hardman out there.

760
00:31:04,246 --> 00:31:06,480
You let him think
that we were working together.

761
00:31:06,482 --> 00:31:09,082
In the deposition yesterday
when you were...

762
00:31:09,084 --> 00:31:12,119
you know, when you were
talking about not...

763
00:31:14,123 --> 00:31:16,056
I've just really enjoyed
working with you, Louis.

764
00:31:16,058 --> 00:31:18,325
- You have?
- Yeah, sure.

765
00:31:20,863 --> 00:31:23,664
Well, I thought Harvey
might have poisoned the well

766
00:31:23,666 --> 00:31:27,568
in regards to any relationship
between the two of us.

767
00:31:27,570 --> 00:31:28,936
Louis,
can I be honest with you?

768
00:31:28,938 --> 00:31:30,604
- Yeah, I can keep it real.
- As far as

769
00:31:30,606 --> 00:31:33,273
poisoning the well goes,

770
00:31:33,275 --> 00:31:36,109
Harvey didn't really
have anything to do with it.

771
00:31:36,111 --> 00:31:37,978
That's pretty much
all been you.

772
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:39,479
What are you talking about?

773
00:31:39,481 --> 00:31:41,081
Among other things,

774
00:31:41,083 --> 00:31:45,018
you tried to sabotage
my relationship with Jenny.

775
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:47,020
After you laughed
at that video of me.

776
00:31:47,022 --> 00:31:48,455
You stuck me in housing court.

777
00:31:48,457 --> 00:31:49,823
'Cause you stole a client
from me.

778
00:31:49,825 --> 00:31:51,859
You tried to blackmail me
with a fake drug test.

779
00:31:51,861 --> 00:31:53,460
Yeah, but it didn't work.

780
00:31:53,462 --> 00:31:55,095
You defeated me. So?

781
00:31:55,097 --> 00:31:56,763
So it's water under the bridge.

782
00:31:56,765 --> 00:31:59,499
No, no, no.
Not water under the bridge.

783
00:31:59,501 --> 00:32:01,301
Louis, you can't do that
to people and expect them

784
00:32:01,303 --> 00:32:04,037
to forget about it and move on.
Don't you get that?

785
00:32:04,039 --> 00:32:07,040
- They should.
- Would you?

786
00:32:11,045 --> 00:32:12,446
Okay.

787
00:32:12,448 --> 00:32:17,584
Mike, I will take
your thoughts...

788
00:32:17,586 --> 00:32:21,655
on my behavior
under advisement.

789
00:32:24,859 --> 00:32:26,693
Wait, Mike? Yeah?

790
00:32:26,695 --> 00:32:31,899
Something's in the air still.
Like a pall of secrecy

791
00:32:31,901 --> 00:32:33,634
or a layer of unease.

792
00:32:33,636 --> 00:32:35,636
I don't know
what you're talking about.

793
00:32:35,638 --> 00:32:37,504
Mm, my spider parts
are tingling.

794
00:32:37,506 --> 00:32:39,339
Please don't ever
say things like that.

795
00:32:39,341 --> 00:32:43,243
Harvey's up to something.
I know it. What is he up to?

796
00:32:45,314 --> 00:32:48,015
I don't know.

797
00:32:48,017 --> 00:32:50,584
- You sure?
- Yes.

798
00:33:02,931 --> 00:33:05,766
Um, Louie's parts are tingling.

799
00:33:05,768 --> 00:33:08,402
I don't want to know what
that means or how you know that.

800
00:33:08,404 --> 00:33:10,003
It means he knows
you're hiding something.

801
00:33:10,005 --> 00:33:11,939
Well, if everything goes
like I expect,

802
00:33:11,941 --> 00:33:13,240
there won't be
anything to hide.

803
00:33:13,242 --> 00:33:14,975
Good, because it just
doesn't feel right lying.

804
00:33:14,977 --> 00:33:16,677
You know, I actually kind of
like working with him.

805
00:33:16,679 --> 00:33:17,878
He's not a bad lawyer.

806
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:20,013
I mean, you know, we have fun.

807
00:33:20,015 --> 00:33:22,616
You guys thinking about
moving in together?

808
00:33:22,618 --> 00:33:24,518
Jealous?

809
00:33:25,787 --> 00:33:27,587
Where's your gatekeeper?

810
00:33:27,589 --> 00:33:30,490
Any Tom, Dick, or Harry
can just waltz right in.

811
00:33:30,492 --> 00:33:33,226
Well, I don't see
any Toms or Harrys here, but...

812
00:33:33,228 --> 00:33:34,962
Okay, can we just please
cut the small talk

813
00:33:34,964 --> 00:33:36,863
and you let me know
what I'm not privy to?

814
00:33:36,865 --> 00:33:38,365
I don't know
what imaginary world

815
00:33:38,367 --> 00:33:40,033
you're skipping through
right now, Louis,

816
00:33:40,035 --> 00:33:42,703
but you're there
all by yourself.

817
00:33:42,705 --> 00:33:44,738
Right.

818
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:46,873
So first you hand me Ross
on a silver platter,

819
00:33:46,875 --> 00:33:48,475
then Donna's not at her desk
for days.

820
00:33:48,477 --> 00:33:50,477
You think that I don't know
that there's a power struggle

821
00:33:50,479 --> 00:33:52,446
going on
between Jessica and Hardman?

822
00:33:53,948 --> 00:33:57,184
Harvey, look,

823
00:33:57,186 --> 00:34:01,421
I admit I haven't
always been, um...

824
00:34:01,423 --> 00:34:04,825
well-behaved,

825
00:34:04,827 --> 00:34:08,495
but I can help you on this.
You just gotta trust me.

826
00:34:08,497 --> 00:34:12,432
Louis, go away.

827
00:34:19,874 --> 00:34:22,042
- That was harsh.
- You kidding me?

828
00:34:22,044 --> 00:34:23,744
He came hat in hand, Harvey.

829
00:34:23,746 --> 00:34:25,912
Have you met him?
This guy gets one whiff

830
00:34:25,914 --> 00:34:27,647
of what we've been hiding
from Hardman,

831
00:34:27,649 --> 00:34:30,083
I guarantee you it's his office
he's in, not ours.

832
00:34:30,085 --> 00:34:32,185
I know, we can't trust him.

833
00:34:32,187 --> 00:34:34,054
Still, you should have seen him
in this deposition.

834
00:34:34,056 --> 00:34:35,622
I mean, all he wants
is to be you.

835
00:34:35,624 --> 00:34:36,890
Isn't that
what everybody wants?

836
00:34:36,892 --> 00:34:38,291
- I'm serious, Harvey.
- Well, I'm sorry.

837
00:34:38,293 --> 00:34:40,093
That's just pathetic.
I know, but what I'm...

838
00:34:40,095 --> 00:34:42,262
Harvey Specter.

839
00:34:42,264 --> 00:34:45,265
Harvey, it's Lawrence Kemp.
Give 'em what they want.

840
00:34:45,267 --> 00:34:47,200
- Good.
- Is that it?

841
00:34:47,202 --> 00:34:48,602
You want a medal?

842
00:34:48,604 --> 00:34:50,404
For what it's worth,
I never meant

843
00:34:50,406 --> 00:34:52,539
to put your reputation
on the line,

844
00:34:52,541 --> 00:34:54,374
and that memo
never crossed my desk.

845
00:34:54,376 --> 00:34:55,642
Goodbye, Lawrence.

846
00:34:55,644 --> 00:34:57,144
They're settling?
You wanted that?

847
00:34:57,146 --> 00:34:59,046
Wanted it?
I goddamn orchestrated it.

848
00:34:59,048 --> 00:35:00,947
CM pays what they should have
in the first place.

849
00:35:00,949 --> 00:35:02,349
And the suit against us
goes away.

850
00:35:02,351 --> 00:35:04,151
And Daniel Hardman's
none the wiser.

851
00:35:04,153 --> 00:35:05,152
Where the hell's Donna?

852
00:35:05,154 --> 00:35:06,887
She's in the file room.

853
00:35:06,889 --> 00:35:08,822
Hasn't found that document yet.

854
00:35:11,726 --> 00:35:13,060
There is no document.

855
00:35:13,062 --> 00:35:14,828
So you believe him?

856
00:35:14,830 --> 00:35:18,765
Not really. I just remember
who we're dealing with.

857
00:35:26,841 --> 00:35:28,842
Harvey.

858
00:35:30,344 --> 00:35:32,379
What are you doing here?

859
00:35:32,381 --> 00:35:36,416
Nothing. Just delivered
CM's settlement offer to Smith.

860
00:35:36,418 --> 00:35:38,385
Or Devane.

861
00:35:38,387 --> 00:35:40,253
I can't remember,
I can't tell those guys apart.

862
00:35:40,255 --> 00:35:41,621
It's not their case.

863
00:35:41,623 --> 00:35:44,524
No, but it is their firm,
and I don't trust you.

864
00:35:44,526 --> 00:35:46,393
Our offer
was take it or leave it.

865
00:35:46,395 --> 00:35:48,628
Well, we took it.
And now we're done.

866
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:49,930
Hmm, well,
I'm afraid there's still

867
00:35:49,932 --> 00:35:52,032
the little matter
of our fraud claim against you.

868
00:35:52,034 --> 00:35:54,501
Tanner, I'm glad you did
what you did.

869
00:35:54,503 --> 00:35:56,369
The Randall family
deserved that money,

870
00:35:56,371 --> 00:35:58,271
but let's not pretend
you've got shit on me.

871
00:35:58,273 --> 00:35:59,473
Excuse me?

872
00:35:59,475 --> 00:36:01,608
You used that memo
to get what you wanted,

873
00:36:01,610 --> 00:36:04,377
but it never would have held up
in court because you wrote it.

874
00:36:04,379 --> 00:36:06,646
That's
a scintillating argument.

875
00:36:06,648 --> 00:36:08,115
Too bad
not a word of it's true.

876
00:36:08,117 --> 00:36:09,749
Well, let's take a look
at your resume.

877
00:36:09,751 --> 00:36:12,452
Witness tampering,
extortion, bribery.

878
00:36:12,454 --> 00:36:13,954
Forgery fits right in.

879
00:36:13,956 --> 00:36:16,289
That document's
the real deal, Harv,

880
00:36:16,291 --> 00:36:17,958
and as far as reputations go,

881
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:21,661
I know all about your dirty
dealings in the D.A.'s office.

882
00:36:21,663 --> 00:36:25,031
Unlike your theories about me,
you were actually investigated

883
00:36:25,033 --> 00:36:28,401
for the very thing you're being
accused of, burying evidence...

884
00:36:28,403 --> 00:36:30,770
a point I can't wait
to bring up in court.

885
00:36:30,772 --> 00:36:32,739
You're the one
with the problem, Harv.

886
00:36:32,741 --> 00:36:34,975
You know I didn't do this.

887
00:36:34,977 --> 00:36:37,277
Hey, thanks for settling
the case for me, buddy,

888
00:36:37,279 --> 00:36:39,079
but I said I wanted
a pound of flesh

889
00:36:39,081 --> 00:36:43,950
from CM and you,
and I meant it.

890
00:36:43,952 --> 00:36:45,986
- That was harsh.
- You kidding me?

891
00:36:45,988 --> 00:36:47,587
He came hat in hand, Harvey.

892
00:36:47,589 --> 00:36:49,823
Have you met him?
This guy gets one whiff

893
00:36:49,825 --> 00:36:51,525
of what we've been hiding
from Hardman,

894
00:36:51,527 --> 00:36:53,894
I guarantee you it's his office
he's in, not ours.

895
00:36:53,896 --> 00:36:56,062
I know, we can't trust him.

896
00:36:56,064 --> 00:36:57,898
Still, you should have seen him
in this deposition.

897
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:59,533
I mean, all he wants
is to be you.

898
00:36:59,535 --> 00:37:00,600
Isn't that
what everybody wants?

899
00:37:00,602 --> 00:37:01,768
I'm serious, Harvey.

900
00:37:01,770 --> 00:37:02,936
I'm sorry,
that's just pathetic.

901
00:37:02,938 --> 00:37:04,237
I know, but what I'm...

902
00:37:04,239 --> 00:37:05,705
Bothering you?

903
00:37:05,707 --> 00:37:09,242
No. No, not at all.

904
00:37:09,244 --> 00:37:10,544
I heard about your proposal

905
00:37:10,546 --> 00:37:12,646
to buy Durham Foods
out of bankruptcy.

906
00:37:12,648 --> 00:37:13,747
Impressive.

907
00:37:13,749 --> 00:37:16,116
Well, the way I see it
is a win-win.

908
00:37:16,118 --> 00:37:19,152
Way to think outside the box.

909
00:37:19,154 --> 00:37:21,655
It was actually
Mike Ross's idea.

910
00:37:21,657 --> 00:37:23,657
I'm glad to see
it all worked out.

911
00:37:29,096 --> 00:37:32,766
Louis...

912
00:37:32,768 --> 00:37:36,369
you seem upset about something.

913
00:37:36,371 --> 00:37:39,372
Is there anything
you want to tell me?

914
00:37:47,542 --> 00:37:49,777
Jessica Pearson,
leading by example.

915
00:37:49,779 --> 00:37:52,179
Spare me the charm, Harvey.
Give it to me straight.

916
00:37:52,181 --> 00:37:54,649
CM settled. $46 million.

917
00:37:54,651 --> 00:37:56,584
1/3 to Frank Randall's widow,

918
00:37:56,586 --> 00:37:58,953
the rest into a blind trust
for his children.

919
00:37:58,955 --> 00:38:00,121
You're pleased with that?

920
00:38:00,123 --> 00:38:01,322
Damn straight I am.

921
00:38:01,324 --> 00:38:03,190
When's the other shoe
gonna drop?

922
00:38:03,192 --> 00:38:04,825
What makes you think
there's another shoe?

923
00:38:04,827 --> 00:38:07,995
It's Tanner.
There's always another shoe.

924
00:38:07,997 --> 00:38:10,932
They're still
coming after us for fraud.

925
00:38:10,934 --> 00:38:13,301
It's time to pay the Piper.

926
00:38:13,303 --> 00:38:15,303
You want to tell him,
or shall I?

927
00:38:15,305 --> 00:38:18,606
Well, we'll worry
about that tomorrow.

928
00:38:18,608 --> 00:38:20,274
What the hell gives you two
the right

929
00:38:20,276 --> 00:38:22,310
to hide a lawsuit
against my firm from me?

930
00:38:22,312 --> 00:38:26,247
- Daniel...
- I am not done yet.

931
00:38:26,249 --> 00:38:29,717
When were you planning on
telling me this?

932
00:38:29,719 --> 00:38:31,218
When the case went to court?

933
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:35,022
When our malpractice insurance
ran out?

934
00:38:35,024 --> 00:38:37,525
Are the two of you
so shortsighted

935
00:38:37,527 --> 00:38:40,094
that you would allow
your distaste of me

936
00:38:40,096 --> 00:38:43,898
to impair your ability
to run this firm?

937
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:49,036
When you came five years ago
to blackmail me, I was furious.

938
00:38:49,038 --> 00:38:53,007
You told me that I was
blaming you for my own actions.

939
00:38:53,009 --> 00:38:55,509
I wasn't just embezzling,
but I also tried to cover it up.

940
00:38:55,511 --> 00:38:57,645
Well, that's what you were
so busy doing

941
00:38:57,647 --> 00:38:58,946
the other morning,
covering it up.

942
00:38:58,948 --> 00:39:00,414
You had the chance to tell me,
and you didn't.

943
00:39:00,416 --> 00:39:01,849
- No, I didn't.
- Why?

944
00:39:01,851 --> 00:39:03,284
I don't trust you.

945
00:39:03,286 --> 00:39:04,618
That's not true.

946
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:08,055
He didn't tell you
because I don't trust you.

947
00:39:08,057 --> 00:39:10,491
Tell me you're not gonna
use this as some power play.

948
00:39:10,493 --> 00:39:13,160
That's exactly
what I should do,

949
00:39:13,162 --> 00:39:14,562
but I am gonna
give you the chance

950
00:39:14,564 --> 00:39:16,664
I have been asking you
to give me,

951
00:39:16,666 --> 00:39:18,733
the chance to redeem yourself.

952
00:39:18,735 --> 00:39:19,900
How?

953
00:39:19,902 --> 00:39:22,203
They're not just
coming after you.

954
00:39:22,205 --> 00:39:25,573
They're coming after all of us.

955
00:39:25,575 --> 00:39:28,976
Pearson. Hardman.

956
00:39:28,978 --> 00:39:30,578
What are you proposing?

957
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:33,547
We fight them together.

958
00:39:35,083 --> 00:39:37,251
Okay.

959
00:39:42,290 --> 00:39:44,892
You trust him?

960
00:39:44,894 --> 00:39:47,895
At the moment,
we don't really have a choice.

961
00:39:53,435 --> 00:39:56,737
Looking good, Louis.

962
00:40:00,075 --> 00:40:02,076
You're supposed to say,
"feeling good, Billy Ray."

963
00:40:02,078 --> 00:40:05,479
You know, <i>Trading Places.</i>
<i>Movie quotes, it's what we do.</i>

964
00:40:05,481 --> 00:40:07,081
You want something?

965
00:40:07,083 --> 00:40:09,116
Uh, well, I just heard

966
00:40:09,118 --> 00:40:11,485
that you ran with my idea
about buying out Durham Foods,

967
00:40:11,487 --> 00:40:13,687
and Hardman told me
you gave me the credit,

968
00:40:13,689 --> 00:40:16,924
so... Team Litt-Ross.

969
00:40:19,828 --> 00:40:21,996
I told him because I don't
like to owe anyone anything.

970
00:40:21,998 --> 00:40:25,599
You covered for me with him
earlier, so I threw you a bone.

971
00:40:25,601 --> 00:40:27,368
Now we're even.
Where's this coming from?

972
00:40:27,370 --> 00:40:28,702
I'll tell you
where it's coming from.

973
00:40:28,704 --> 00:40:30,871
You were right.
Actions have impact.

974
00:40:30,873 --> 00:40:35,176
So you want to remember
the marijuana and tennis thing?

975
00:40:35,178 --> 00:40:38,179
Well, I'm gonna
remember things too.

976
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:54,395
How's your budding bro-mance
with Louis?

977
00:40:54,397 --> 00:40:56,297
Evidently, it's over.

978
00:40:56,299 --> 00:40:58,499
So fickle is the heart.

979
00:40:58,501 --> 00:41:02,303
What's going on with you?
Why are you being so... weird?

980
00:41:02,305 --> 00:41:04,071
Tanner took the deal.

981
00:41:04,073 --> 00:41:05,306
So it's done.

982
00:41:05,308 --> 00:41:08,342
No. He's still
coming after me for fraud,

983
00:41:08,344 --> 00:41:10,544
and a lot of people are gonna
think I buried that document.

984
00:41:10,546 --> 00:41:12,179
How can you bury
what doesn't exist?

985
00:41:12,181 --> 00:41:13,647
Doesn't matter.

986
00:41:13,649 --> 00:41:18,519
They'll think it happened once,
it could happen again.

987
00:41:18,521 --> 00:41:21,322
So why are you smiling?

988
00:41:21,324 --> 00:41:24,225
Because I know what they don't.

989
00:41:24,227 --> 00:41:26,594
You're gonna beat Tanner.

990
00:41:26,596 --> 00:41:30,464
I'm not just gonna beat him.
When I'm done with him,

991
00:41:30,466 --> 00:41:33,601
his own mother
won't even recognize him.

992
00:41:55,257 --> 00:41:57,324
Ah, that's where you are.
I've been looking for you.

993
00:42:00,897 --> 00:42:03,497
You okay? You look like
you're gonna be sick.

994
00:42:03,499 --> 00:42:05,599
Oh, God, you know,
actually, I do,

995
00:42:05,601 --> 00:42:07,168
I feel like
I'm coming down with something.

996
00:42:07,170 --> 00:42:09,370
Do you think that maybe
you could grab me a water?

997
00:42:09,372 --> 00:42:11,639
Yeah. Yeah, of course.
