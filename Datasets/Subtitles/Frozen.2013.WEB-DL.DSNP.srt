725
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,360
Wherever could it be coming from?

726
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:18,560

728
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,200
That will be 40.

Forty? No, 10.

730

Oh, dear, that's no good.

731
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:27,120
See, this is from our winter stock,

732
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:29,200

have a big problem.

738
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,080
Still 40.

739
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,240
But I will throw in
a visit to Oaken's sauna.

740

Okay. Ten will get you this and no more.

00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,200
Okay, just tell me one thing.

745

on the North Mountain?

746
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,960

I will add a quart of lutefisk,

It was all my fault.

805

I got engaged, but then she freaked out,

806
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:42,960
because I'd only just met him,
you know, that day.

807

And she said she wouldn't
bless the marriage, and...

00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:48,520
Wait. You got engaged
to someone you just met that day?

809
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:51,880
Yeah.
Anyway, I got mad, and so she got mad,

810
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:52,920
and then she tried to walk away,

811
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
and I grabbed her glove...

812
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:55,040
Hang on!

813
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,080

Yes. Pay attention.

816
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:04,320
But the thing is,
she wore the gloves all the time,

817
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,600
so I just thought,
maybe she has a thing about dirt.

818
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:09,640
Didn't your parents ever
warn you about strangers?

Yes, they did.

-Yeah.

1075
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:12,600
I bet she's the nicest,
gentlest, warmest person ever.

1076
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:14,840
Oh. Look at that.

1077
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:17,160
I've been impaled.

KRISTOFF: Mmm...

1080
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:26,880
It's too steep.

1081
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:29,440
I've only got one rope and you don't
know how to climb mountains.

What are you doing?

1085
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:37,600
I'm going to see my sister.

1086
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:39,240
You're gonna kill yourself.

1087
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:41,960
-(GRUNTS)
-I wouldn't put my foot there.

1088
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,640
-You're distracting me.
-Or there.

1089
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:45,720
How do you know
Elsa even wants to see you?

1090
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:47,440
ANNA: All right. I'm just blocking you out

1091
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:50,200
because I gotta concentrate, here.
(GRUNTING)

1092

You know, most people who disappear

1093
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:53,400
into the mountains want to be alone.

1094
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:55,880
Nobody wants to be alone.

1095
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:57,400
Except maybe you.

1096
00:51:57,560 --> 00:52:00,640
I'm not alone. I have friends, remember?

1097
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:03,320
ANNA: You mean, the love experts?

1098
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:05,520
Yes, the love experts.

1099
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:07,720
(GRUNTS) Ah...

1100
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:10,040
Please tell me I'm almost there.

1101
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:13,520

OLAF: Hey, Sven?

1105
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:19,320
Not sure if this is gonna
solve the problem,

1106
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:21,400
but I found a staircase that leads exactly

1107
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:22,560
where you wanted to go.

1108
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:24,560

Now, that's ice.

00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:47,920
I might cry.

1115

Knock.

1123
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:16,160
Just knock.

1124
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:18,720
Why isn't she knocking?

1125
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:21,120
Do you think she knows how to knock?

That's a first.

Oh. You should probably wait out here.

-What?
-The last time I introduced her to a guy,

1131

she froze everything.

But, but... Oh, come on!

00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:40,840
It's a palace made of ice. Ice is my life!

-Just give us a minute.

It's a good different.

1147
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:24,880
And this place...

1148
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:26,520
It's amazing.

Thank you.

00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:30,240
I never knew what I was capable of.

1151
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:33,560
I'm so sorry about what happened.
If I'd have known...

1152

No, no, no. It's okay.

1153

You don't have to apologize,
but you should probably go.

Please.

But I just got here.

1156
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:44,520
You belong down in Arendelle.

So do you.

1158
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:48,160
No, Anna, I belong here.

1159
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:50,360
Alone.

1160
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:54,800
Where I can be who I am
without hurting anybody.

1161
00:54:55,120 --> 00:54:57,040
Actually, about that...

-OLAF: Sixty!
-Wait. What is that?

Yeah. You built me.

Remember that?

No, I'm just trying to protect you.

1180

You don't have to protect me.
I'm not afraid.
