00:00:00,024 --> 00:00:01,478
Previously on
<i>Suits...</i>

2
00:00:01,503 --> 00:00:02,967
I'm bonding
with your father here.

3
00:00:02,968 --> 00:00:04,660
- Speaking of which--
- You're not taking it easy

4
00:00:04,661 --> 00:00:05,791
on me, are you?
A little.

5
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:07,350
You mean something to me.

6
00:00:07,418 --> 00:00:09,269
You've always meant something
to me

7
00:00:09,353 --> 00:00:12,139
and you always will mean
something to me.

8
00:00:12,223 --> 00:00:14,441
What do you need, Harvey?

9
00:00:14,525 --> 00:00:16,059
Ava Hessington.

10
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:17,944
I am not losing to him.

11
00:00:18,029 --> 00:00:19,196
You.

12
00:00:19,263 --> 00:00:22,065
Your blood feud
or whatever it is

13
00:00:22,116 --> 00:00:24,066
you have with that man
is what put the target

14
00:00:24,091 --> 00:00:25,545
on my back in the first place.

15
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:28,294
I made this mess.
It's up to me to clear it up.

16
00:00:28,968 --> 00:00:31,299
Harvey and Cameron made a deal
to take you down.

17
00:00:31,317 --> 00:00:34,031
And part of that deal
was that I got to be the one

18
00:00:34,032 --> 00:00:35,199
to tell you about it.

19
00:00:35,283 --> 00:00:36,844
If he can't practice law
in the country,

20
00:00:36,851 --> 00:00:38,131
he can't be a member
of our firm.

21
00:00:38,186 --> 00:00:39,787
You set this whole thing up.

22
00:00:39,854 --> 00:00:41,822
Jessica set
this whole thing up.

23
00:00:41,873 --> 00:00:44,524
And, Edward,
we may be getting a divorce,

24
00:00:44,576 --> 00:00:47,127
but I fully intend on keeping
ownership of the house.

25
00:01:01,726 --> 00:01:03,727
Oh, come on, just because
I have to wake up early

26
00:01:03,812 --> 00:01:05,229
doesn't mean you
should suffer.

27
00:01:05,313 --> 00:01:06,434
Well, you know
what they say.

28
00:01:06,481 --> 00:01:08,548
The couple
that wakes together...

29
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,984
Bakes together?

30
00:01:11,052 --> 00:01:14,054
- Stays together.
- Yeah, that doesn't rhyme.

31
00:01:14,105 --> 00:01:16,240
You're ridiculous.

32
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:20,894
Oh, my God.
That's amazing.

33
00:01:20,945 --> 00:01:22,562
I know.

34
00:01:22,614 --> 00:01:23,831
You're amazing.

35
00:01:23,898 --> 00:01:25,833
I know.

36
00:01:31,539 --> 00:01:34,458
You have no intention of
letting me go to work, do you?

37
00:01:34,542 --> 00:01:39,379
There once was a girl
from Nantucket.

38
00:01:39,431 --> 00:01:42,216
I love you.

39
00:01:42,267 --> 00:01:43,583
Oh, that doesn't rhyme,
you know?

40
00:01:43,635 --> 00:01:44,935
What are you,
the rhyming police now?

41
00:01:45,019 --> 00:01:47,304
- You started it.
- And I'm gonna finish it.

42
00:01:47,388 --> 00:01:49,690
I love you too.

43
00:02:00,819 --> 00:02:02,319
You look happier
than you did last night.

44
00:02:02,403 --> 00:02:04,321
I am.

45
00:02:06,374 --> 00:02:07,574
What are you doing here?

46
00:02:07,625 --> 00:02:09,376
I was thinking
I'd give you a ride.

47
00:02:09,443 --> 00:02:10,911
You just gave me a ride
last night.

48
00:02:10,962 --> 00:02:13,330
Yeah, this time
I thought I'd join you.

49
00:02:13,414 --> 00:02:15,615
Harvey,
we put in 15-hour days

50
00:02:15,667 --> 00:02:16,800
12 feet from each other.

51
00:02:16,885 --> 00:02:18,405
You really want
to go to work together?

52
00:02:18,452 --> 00:02:20,120
Who said anything
about work?

53
00:02:20,171 --> 00:02:21,505
We have breakfast
at Nougatine

54
00:02:21,589 --> 00:02:23,674
and an excursion to Hermes
that may or may not

55
00:02:23,758 --> 00:02:25,458
involve a new handbag.

56
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:27,728
You've been needing
a new handbag.

57
00:02:27,795 --> 00:02:29,462
You can never have
too many handbags.

58
00:02:29,514 --> 00:02:30,835
You're a woman
after my own heart.

59
00:02:30,849 --> 00:02:32,683
Well, in that case...

60
00:02:35,636 --> 00:02:40,107
Harvey...
Why are you doing this?

61
00:02:40,158 --> 00:02:42,659
Donna, we've all
been through a lot.

62
00:02:42,744 --> 00:02:45,496
We deserve
a little celebration.

63
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:48,532
Well, in that case,
you have had it pretty rough.

64
00:02:48,616 --> 00:02:50,834
We're gonna need to get you
more than one handbag.

65
00:02:50,919 --> 00:02:54,671
I wouldn't have it
any other way.

66
00:03:06,518 --> 00:03:07,684
Jessica.

67
00:03:07,769 --> 00:03:10,687
Louis, what can I do
for you?

68
00:03:10,772 --> 00:03:12,139
Actually, I'm not here
about me.

69
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:13,273
I'm here about you.

70
00:03:13,341 --> 00:03:15,859
How so?

71
00:03:15,944 --> 00:03:20,697
Um...

72
00:03:20,782 --> 00:03:22,065
I want to handle
the dissolution.

73
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:23,784
So this is about you.

74
00:03:23,851 --> 00:03:26,353
No.
Jessica...

75
00:03:26,404 --> 00:03:28,956
I got Ava out
when you wanted her out.

76
00:03:29,023 --> 00:03:30,707
I proved that I will do
whatever it takes.

77
00:03:30,792 --> 00:03:33,193
And what's more,
I know Darby's assets,

78
00:03:33,244 --> 00:03:35,245
and I will get you everything
that you have coming.

79
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:36,880
I can get everything
I have coming.

80
00:03:36,965 --> 00:03:38,832
Maybe, but after
what Stephen Huntley

81
00:03:38,883 --> 00:03:41,124
and Edward Darby did, you want
to exact a pound of flesh.

82
00:03:41,135 --> 00:03:44,638
You want to kill them both.

83
00:03:44,705 --> 00:03:46,039
What's your point?

84
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:48,010
My point is, is that you go
into that room angry,

85
00:03:48,059 --> 00:03:50,177
you're gonna have blinders on.

86
00:03:50,228 --> 00:03:52,179
And they're gonna lead you
any way they want you to go.

87
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:54,181
I get in that room,
I'm cool as a cucumber,

88
00:03:54,232 --> 00:03:57,384
and I will lead whatever way
you want to go.

89
00:03:57,435 --> 00:04:00,220
We just got Edward Darby's
proposed formula

90
00:04:00,271 --> 00:04:01,888
for splitting our assets.

91
00:04:06,611 --> 00:04:08,829
- Son of a bitch.
- I know!

92
00:04:08,896 --> 00:04:10,781
He thinks he can dictate terms
after what he's done?

93
00:04:10,865 --> 00:04:11,898
We need to crush him.

94
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:13,116
See?
Blinders.

95
00:04:13,201 --> 00:04:14,618
What?

96
00:04:14,702 --> 00:04:17,170
Louis was just suggesting
that he run the negotiations.

97
00:04:17,238 --> 00:04:20,290
Louis also suggested the firm
adopt a badger as a mascot.

98
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:21,908
The badger is a noble
and fearsome creature,

99
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,794
but that's not the point.
I can beat them.

100
00:04:23,878 --> 00:04:25,128
And the Washington Generals
think they can beat

101
00:04:25,213 --> 00:04:26,597
the Globetrotters,
but they're not even

102
00:04:26,681 --> 00:04:27,914
in the same league.

103
00:04:27,966 --> 00:04:29,299
My father played
for the Washington Generals.

104
00:04:29,384 --> 00:04:30,934
- See?
- So what are you saying?

105
00:04:31,019 --> 00:04:32,469
I'm not in your league?
I'm saying you and I

106
00:04:32,553 --> 00:04:33,920
don't even play the same sport.

107
00:04:33,972 --> 00:04:36,857
Harvey...enough.
And Louis has a point.

108
00:04:36,924 --> 00:04:38,758
You seriously want
to consider this?

109
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:39,893
This is a joke.

110
00:04:39,944 --> 00:04:42,779
Louis, will you give us
a moment?

111
00:04:42,864 --> 00:04:44,865
Please?

112
00:04:47,902 --> 00:04:50,988
I am not a joke.

113
00:04:56,044 --> 00:04:57,911
You can't do that anymore.

114
00:04:57,962 --> 00:04:59,112
You mean make fun of Louis?

115
00:04:59,163 --> 00:05:00,747
It's one of life's
great pleasures.

116
00:05:00,798 --> 00:05:02,198
When the two of you
were colleagues,

117
00:05:02,216 --> 00:05:04,284
that's fair game,
but you're a name partner now,

118
00:05:04,335 --> 00:05:05,815
and you have to show him
some respect.

119
00:05:05,837 --> 00:05:07,254
I am showing him respect.

120
00:05:07,305 --> 00:05:10,957
I'm being dismissive
to his face.

121
00:05:11,009 --> 00:05:13,427
Harvey, remember Kopelman?

122
00:05:13,478 --> 00:05:15,512
Combovers like that
are hard to forget.

123
00:05:15,596 --> 00:05:18,231
When I first started here,
he and I would fight

124
00:05:18,299 --> 00:05:21,735
like cats and dogs every day,
toe-to-toe.

125
00:05:21,802 --> 00:05:23,070
Then one day
he went too far.

126
00:05:23,137 --> 00:05:25,322
He crossed a line,
and I'd had enough,

127
00:05:25,406 --> 00:05:28,808
and I went in,
and I ripped him up.

128
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,477
You know what I did the day
after Daniel and I

129
00:05:30,528 --> 00:05:32,696
took over the firm?

130
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:36,983
I went to Kopelman, and I told
him how much I valued him.

131
00:05:38,453 --> 00:05:40,087
Kopelman never voted
against you

132
00:05:40,154 --> 00:05:41,821
the whole time I knew him.

133
00:05:41,873 --> 00:05:43,707
Exactly.

134
00:05:43,791 --> 00:05:45,125
And by the way,
Louis is right.

135
00:05:45,176 --> 00:05:48,295
Jessica, it's one thing for me
to show Louis respect.

136
00:05:48,346 --> 00:05:50,931
But you want to put me
on the sidelines for him?

137
00:05:50,998 --> 00:05:52,382
No.

138
00:05:52,467 --> 00:05:54,768
I'm gonna put him in
at quarterback,

139
00:05:54,835 --> 00:05:57,020

So let me get this straight.

150
00:06:29,128 --> 00:06:30,560
You want to go after
their clients

151
00:06:30,561 --> 00:06:31,936
so we get to count
those revenues.

152
00:06:32,087 --> 00:06:34,610
Whoever has more revenue
is gonna determine

153
00:06:34,611 --> 00:06:36,278
who gets what at the time
of closing.

154
00:06:36,363 --> 00:06:37,763
Louis locks in
the settlement terms

155
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:39,315
while we tip the basis
for the settlement.

156
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:40,816
Exactly.

157
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:42,818
Some might say that's
negotiating in bad faith.

158
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:45,705
And I say Darby wasn't above
board when we got married.

159
00:06:45,772 --> 00:06:48,607
Why should we be above board
when we're getting divorced?

160
00:06:48,659 --> 00:06:49,992
And until the settlement
is done,

161
00:06:50,077 --> 00:06:51,117
it's not stealing clients.

162
00:06:51,128 --> 00:06:53,112
It's shifting
the attorney of record.

163
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:55,214
Wait a minute.

164
00:06:55,281 --> 00:06:57,133
Did you think of this
all by yourself?

165
00:06:57,217 --> 00:06:58,897
Why wouldn't I think of this
all by myself?

166
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:00,386
It as Jessica, wasn't it?

167
00:07:00,453 --> 00:07:01,971
She thought of it
all by yourself.

168
00:07:02,055 --> 00:07:03,789
The important thing right now
is to decide

169
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,257
which client to go after.

170
00:07:05,308 --> 00:07:06,959
And to avoid my question
about whose idea it was.

171
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:08,678
- Exactly.
- Okay.

172
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:11,130
Well, if it's going to affect
the settlement calculations,

173
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:13,566
we're gonna need a big client
and we're gonna need a big one

174
00:07:13,633 --> 00:07:14,984
who just took a loss.

175
00:07:15,068 --> 00:07:16,902
Not necessarily.

176
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:19,321
You know who cries hardest
in the Miss America pageant?

177
00:07:19,406 --> 00:07:21,190
- The runner-up.
- The winner...

178
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:23,242
Because she knows
she can't win again,

179
00:07:23,309 --> 00:07:25,528
and winners always want
to win more.

180
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:27,697
Yeah.
That's not why they cry.

181
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:29,699
What's wrong with you?
Stay with me.

182
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:33,335
What we need is a huge company
that is still looking

183
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:34,670
to keep the crown.

184
00:07:38,675 --> 00:07:39,842
Samsung.

185
00:07:39,926 --> 00:07:42,094
- Get it going.
- Yeah.

186
00:07:42,162 --> 00:07:43,996
Wait. Do you--
you actually watch

187
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:45,181
the Miss America pageant?

188
00:07:45,265 --> 00:07:47,016
No, but I've celebrated
with the winner.

189
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:50,335
- Texas, Florida, New York?
- California.

190
00:07:50,387 --> 00:07:52,688
Now, there's a question
you didn't want to avoid.

191
00:07:52,773 --> 00:07:55,024
Exactly.

192
00:07:58,028 --> 00:07:59,278
You wanted to see me?

193
00:07:59,345 --> 00:08:01,781
- Yes, and it's important.
- What can I do for you?

194
00:08:01,848 --> 00:08:03,983
Adjust the font
on the new business cards?

195
00:08:04,034 --> 00:08:06,202
Order some pens?
I don't know.

196
00:08:06,286 --> 00:08:07,787
If we don't have any pens,

197
00:08:07,854 --> 00:08:09,905
what would you sign
the order with?

198
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,373
What do you want, Jessica?

199
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:12,708
I was just making
a little joke.

200
00:08:12,793 --> 00:08:14,860
Oh, I thought I was
the only joke around here.

201
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:18,380
Louis, you are no joke.

202
00:08:18,465 --> 00:08:19,749
And you're right.

203
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:23,052
You have been on the sidelines
far too long.

204
00:08:23,136 --> 00:08:26,889
I want you to handle
the negotiations.

205
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:28,390
You won't be sorry.

206
00:08:28,475 --> 00:08:29,592
You want a pound of flesh,

207
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:30,643
I'm gonna bring you
the whole carcass.

208
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:31,877
I believe you would,

209
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:33,229
but I'm going to ask you
to do something else.

210
00:08:33,313 --> 00:08:35,347
- Anything you need.
- I need you to be fair.

211
00:08:37,884 --> 00:08:41,403
- Fair?
- Yes, fair.

212
00:08:41,488 --> 00:08:43,823
- That's one way to go.
- It's <i>the</i> way to go...

213
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:46,242
Because I need them to think
that we're moving on,

214
00:08:46,326 --> 00:08:48,744
when, in fact,
we're going after their clients.

215
00:08:48,829 --> 00:08:51,563
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

216
00:08:51,615 --> 00:08:53,199
You and Harvey are letting me in
on one of your missions?

217
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:55,668
This is Litt-tastic.
Louis, calm down.

218
00:08:55,735 --> 00:08:56,869
Calm down?
No!

219
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,337
This is just like
<i>The Great Escape.</i>

220
00:08:58,404 --> 00:08:59,839
You're recruiting me
to go behind enemy lines.

221
00:08:59,906 --> 00:09:01,340
I'm Steve McQueen.

222
00:09:01,407 --> 00:09:02,758
- You know <i>The Great Escape?</i>
- <i>Are you kidding?</i>

223
00:09:02,843 --> 00:09:04,510
Charles Bronson grew up
in my grandmother's shtetl.

224
00:09:04,577 --> 00:09:08,547
Then you know Steve McQueen
was the cooler king.

225
00:09:08,598 --> 00:09:12,518
Louis, I need you to be
my cooler king.

226
00:09:12,585 --> 00:09:14,854
Yeah, I am cool.

227
00:09:14,921 --> 00:09:17,223
So you're authorizing me
to sign on your behalf?

228
00:09:17,274 --> 00:09:20,092
Yes, but under
no circumstances

229
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:22,728
are you to lock in the existing
client allocations.

230
00:09:22,779 --> 00:09:24,113
Please, I'd die
before that happens.

231
00:09:24,147 --> 00:09:25,781
Let's hope it doesn't come
to that.

232
00:09:28,952 --> 00:09:30,452
- Is that coconut water?
- Yeah.

233
00:09:30,537 --> 00:09:31,937
I'm sorry.

234
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:33,268
I took some with me
this morning.

235
00:09:33,273 --> 00:09:34,490
I hope you don't mind.

236
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:35,991
Why would I mind?
You needed the hydration.

237
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:38,244
You made me need
the hydration.

238
00:09:38,295 --> 00:09:39,411
You're welcome.

239
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:48,787
- What?
- Nothing.

240
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:50,339
What?

241
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:52,591
Uh...

242
00:09:52,642 --> 00:09:54,626
I just don't like
when you drink

243
00:09:54,678 --> 00:09:56,512
from the bottles
in the refrigerator.

244
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,814
- But it's my bottle.
- The ones in my fridge aren't.

245
00:09:58,899 --> 00:10:00,316
So you do mind
that I took it.

246
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:05,271
No, I mind that you drink
from the bottles in my fridge.

247
00:10:05,322 --> 00:10:06,638
Okay.

248
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:11,193
And that you left your
coffee mug in the sink again.

249
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:12,695
I thought I was supposed
to put the mug in the sink.

250
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:14,697
Yes, on the right side.
The left side is for rinsing.

251
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:16,782
I can't rinse if there
are dishes piled on both sides.

252
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:18,483
I'll try and remember that.

253
00:10:18,535 --> 00:10:21,820
You'd think a guy with your
memory wouldn't have to try.

254
00:10:21,872 --> 00:10:23,873
- All right, let's hear it.
- Hear what?

255
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:25,507
- The list.
- What list?

256
00:10:25,592 --> 00:10:26,792
Of things I do
that annoy you.

257
00:10:26,843 --> 00:10:28,260
- I don't have a list.
- Everyone has a list.

258
00:10:28,328 --> 00:10:29,845
- Do you have a list?
- This isn't about my list.

259
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:31,163
This is about your list.

260
00:10:31,214 --> 00:10:33,132
No, it's about yours
because I just told you

261
00:10:33,183 --> 00:10:34,499
everything that's on mine.

262
00:10:34,551 --> 00:10:36,852
You're telling me
that the most meticulous woman

263
00:10:36,937 --> 00:10:39,004
on the upper West Side
only has a list of two?

264
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:40,689
- That's not fair.
- No, what's not fair

265
00:10:40,774 --> 00:10:42,441
is you making this
all about me.

266
00:10:42,508 --> 00:10:44,560
I might not be perfect,
but neither are you.

267
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,612
So, excuse me, I have more
important things to do

268
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:50,449
than talk about where
I left my coffee cup.

269
00:10:50,516 --> 00:10:51,984
- Fair?
- Fair.

270
00:10:52,035 --> 00:10:55,704
- Fair?
- Yes, fair.

271
00:10:55,789 --> 00:10:58,457
I didn't even like playing
nice in the sandbox.

272
00:10:58,524 --> 00:10:59,541
Someone has better sand toys,

273
00:10:59,626 --> 00:11:00,826
you take 'em.
Exactly.

274
00:11:00,877 --> 00:11:02,361
And you don't ask
Bolshoi ballerinas

275
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:03,579
to dance the tango.

276
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,224
That would indeed
be blasphemy.

277
00:11:05,298 --> 00:11:06,582
If Jessica wants compromise,

278
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:09,335
she should hire a mediator,
not a gladiator.

279
00:11:09,386 --> 00:11:11,387
Except Jessica
doesn't want compromise.

280
00:11:11,471 --> 00:11:13,839
She wants a stone-cold killer to
do one thing and one thing only.

281
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:15,257
And what is that?

282
00:11:15,342 --> 00:11:17,893
Not to lock client allocations
till Harvey lands Samsung.

283
00:11:17,978 --> 00:11:19,228
Then give me an order.

284
00:11:19,312 --> 00:11:22,231
Your order is to not let
my inner gladiator

285
00:11:22,315 --> 00:11:24,049
get past my outer negotiator.

286
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,068
That's not
gonna be easy, Louis.

287
00:11:26,152 --> 00:11:27,872
You're like the Hulk--
once you get enraged,

288
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:29,321
there's no going back.

289
00:11:29,389 --> 00:11:30,722
Though your description
of both my temperament

290
00:11:30,774 --> 00:11:32,942
and physique is accurate,
the one thing that I have

291
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:35,244
on my side is that I have
no personal animus

292
00:11:35,328 --> 00:11:37,329
against the other side.

293
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:46,038
Nesbitt.

294
00:11:46,089 --> 00:11:47,957
Litt.

295
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:50,075
I see you're wearing
your checkered suit

296
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:51,576
with your crimson power tie.

297
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:53,212
You see correctly.

298
00:11:53,263 --> 00:11:54,746
Looks like you came
to play hardball.

299
00:11:54,798 --> 00:11:55,998
I didn't come
to play anything.

300
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:57,749
I came to win.
Well, I'm not here to win.

301
00:11:57,801 --> 00:12:00,219
I'm here to make sure we
hammer out a fair agreement.

302
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:01,720
And to help you achieve that,

303
00:12:01,771 --> 00:12:03,805
I see you've brought along
Tinker Bell.

304
00:12:04,167 --> 00:12:05,634
You were so scared
of Tinker Bell,

305
00:12:05,659 --> 00:12:07,390
you sent her to Barcelona,
for your cat trial.

306
00:12:07,415 --> 00:12:09,134
During which time,
she worked closely,

307
00:12:09,135 --> 00:12:11,119
with a different senior partner...

308
00:12:11,171 --> 00:12:14,340
again and again.

309
00:12:14,424 --> 00:12:17,226
Don't worry.

310
00:12:17,293 --> 00:12:19,561
Dr. Banner's
not turning green today.

311
00:12:19,629 --> 00:12:22,314
See, whatever you thought was
gonna happen to me here isn't.

312
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,650
So go ahead,
wind me up all you want,

313
00:12:24,734 --> 00:12:26,185
'cause I ain't losing my cool.

314
00:12:26,269 --> 00:12:28,303
Fine.

315
00:12:28,355 --> 00:12:30,656
This is my initial proposal.

316
00:12:35,328 --> 00:12:36,996
Those are letters
I wrote to Mikado.

317
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:39,164
Unopened.

318
00:12:39,249 --> 00:12:40,699
You never read them to her?

319
00:12:40,784 --> 00:12:43,151
- Not a single word.
- You son of a bitch.

320
00:12:43,203 --> 00:12:45,504
You think you can rattle me?
I'm un-rattleable.

321
00:12:45,588 --> 00:12:47,840
Really?

322
00:12:47,924 --> 00:12:50,626
This portrait
that you sent her.

323
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:55,047
Get out!

324
00:12:55,131 --> 00:12:57,049
- Louis--
- I said go.

325
00:13:02,839 --> 00:13:05,140
Oh, yeah, you and I
are going to war.

326
00:13:05,191 --> 00:13:07,109
Everything's
on the goddamn table!

327
00:13:07,176 --> 00:13:09,778
Including the existing
client list allocations?

328
00:13:09,846 --> 00:13:13,115
Did you hear what I just said?
I said everything!

329
00:13:19,823 --> 00:13:21,690
You son of a bitch.

330
00:13:21,741 --> 00:13:23,292
You knew
I'd come after Samsung.

331
00:13:23,359 --> 00:13:25,661
I knew what suit
you'd be wearing.

332
00:13:25,712 --> 00:13:27,997
I know Tiger Woods
wears red on Sundays.

333
00:13:28,048 --> 00:13:29,331
It doesn't mean
I can beat him.

334
00:13:29,382 --> 00:13:32,301
I'm not going to let you poach
our clients, Harvey.

335
00:13:32,368 --> 00:13:34,202
You poaching our clients
is what led us

336
00:13:34,254 --> 00:13:36,505
to this goddamn merger
in the first place.

337
00:13:36,556 --> 00:13:38,807
That was fair game.
This is bad faith.

338
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:41,209
Bad faith?
I'm going after Samsung.

339
00:13:41,261 --> 00:13:43,621
I'm not murdering anybody and
lying about it to my partners.

340
00:13:43,646 --> 00:13:45,147
Don't you dare put me in
with them.

341
00:13:45,214 --> 00:13:46,732
You put yourself in
with them.

342
00:13:46,816 --> 00:13:48,383
Speaking of which,
what the hell you still doing

343
00:13:48,435 --> 00:13:49,885
in bed with these people,
Scottie?

344
00:13:49,936 --> 00:13:52,438
As you know, I don't always
have the best judgment

345
00:13:52,522 --> 00:13:53,939
of who I get in bed with.

346
00:13:54,024 --> 00:13:55,607
And as for why I'm still
in business with them--

347
00:13:55,692 --> 00:13:56,825
Let me guess.

348
00:13:56,893 --> 00:13:58,944
You beat me
on the dissolution negotiation,

349
00:13:59,029 --> 00:14:00,162
you get your name on the door.

350
00:14:00,229 --> 00:14:01,330
Yep.
Darby agreed to it

351
00:14:01,397 --> 00:14:03,282
the second
that you pushed him out.

352
00:14:03,366 --> 00:14:05,167
He only did that because
he knew when word got out

353
00:14:05,234 --> 00:14:07,119
that his house was on fire,
he had to do something.

354
00:14:07,203 --> 00:14:09,371
Well, he did.
He put me against you.

355
00:14:09,422 --> 00:14:11,907
And as you just noted,
our house is on fire,

356
00:14:11,958 --> 00:14:13,959
and I'm gonna fight tooth and
nail to put the damn thing out.

357
00:14:14,044 --> 00:14:16,078
You can fight tooth and nail
all you like,

358
00:14:16,129 --> 00:14:18,380
but it's never done a thing
for you against me before.

359
00:14:18,431 --> 00:14:19,882
That's because I always
had something else

360
00:14:19,933 --> 00:14:21,467
on my mind before,

361
00:14:21,551 --> 00:14:24,386
but you've made it clear that
that's never going to happen.

362
00:14:24,437 --> 00:14:25,754
So, if you think
you're gonna win this time,

363
00:14:25,805 --> 00:14:27,523
you've got
another thing coming.

364
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:28,941
Say what you want, Scottie.

365
00:14:29,025 --> 00:14:30,559
I'm going in there,
and you're not gonna stop me.

366
00:14:33,813 --> 00:14:35,147
I'm afraid I already did.

367
00:14:35,231 --> 00:14:36,782
Client list just got locked.

368
00:14:36,866 --> 00:14:38,767
So you can go in there
and give it a shot,

369
00:14:38,818 --> 00:14:39,985
but they're never gonna sign
with a guy

370
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:42,788
who just got played
on their front porch.

371
00:14:53,324 --> 00:14:55,307
- Hey.
- Hey.

372
00:14:56,108 --> 00:14:57,836
I got your message.

373
00:14:57,856 --> 00:14:59,190
Thanks for meeting me.

374
00:14:59,274 --> 00:15:01,609
It's not often I get invited
out to hear an apology.

375
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:05,145
I'm so sorry
I snapped at you.

376
00:15:05,197 --> 00:15:09,316
I got defensive, and when I went
away to think about it,

377
00:15:09,368 --> 00:15:10,535
I came up with why.

378
00:15:10,619 --> 00:15:11,752
Why?

379
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:15,155
I feel like a guest
in your apartment.

380
00:15:15,207 --> 00:15:17,508
And I think it's because
we spend all of our time

381
00:15:17,593 --> 00:15:19,794
at your place and none
of the time at mine.

382
00:15:19,845 --> 00:15:21,295
Yeah, but I told you,
when I'm at your place,

383
00:15:21,346 --> 00:15:23,831
all I can picture is Tess
in a bedsheet.

384
00:15:23,882 --> 00:15:27,001
I know.
And that's why we're here.

385
00:15:27,052 --> 00:15:29,136
Come on, I want
to show you something.

386
00:15:33,008 --> 00:15:35,026
Louis, we gave you one job,
and you blew it.

387
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:37,228
How the hell did you screw up
those negotiations?

388
00:15:37,312 --> 00:15:38,512
Screw up? Come on.
What are you talking about?

389
00:15:38,564 --> 00:15:39,530
I got us the corporate jet.

390
00:15:39,615 --> 00:15:41,015
We keep
our first dividend checks,

391
00:15:41,066 --> 00:15:42,233
and they pay
for our new letterhead.

392
00:15:42,317 --> 00:15:43,534
So you know what?

393
00:15:43,619 --> 00:15:45,119
You just put that in your pipe,
and you smoke it.

394
00:15:45,186 --> 00:15:47,538
I don't give a shit
about the goddamn letterhead!

395
00:15:47,623 --> 00:15:48,990
You don't think
I know that?

396
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:51,742
Nobody cares about
the goddamn letterhead, okay?

397
00:15:51,827 --> 00:15:53,294
Nigel went after Mikado.

398
00:15:53,361 --> 00:15:54,912
What the hell is Mikado?

399
00:15:54,997 --> 00:15:56,414
Not "what," "who."
She's a cat.

400
00:15:56,498 --> 00:15:58,049
He went after your cat?

401
00:15:58,133 --> 00:15:59,467
He went after his cat.

402
00:15:59,534 --> 00:16:03,170
He tortured his cat?

403
00:16:03,222 --> 00:16:06,641
He deprived her
of my letters.

404
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:12,146
Louis, you lost your shit
during a negotiation

405
00:16:12,213 --> 00:16:14,548
because someone didn't read
your letters to their cat?

406
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:18,319
Harvey, please.
I'm sorry I lost my head.

407
00:16:18,386 --> 00:16:20,721
I don't even remember
signing the agreement.

408
00:16:20,772 --> 00:16:22,990
Well, you did!

409
00:16:23,058 --> 00:16:24,609
And, Louis,
you've been asking Jessica

410
00:16:24,693 --> 00:16:26,226
to give you the ball
instead of me

411
00:16:26,278 --> 00:16:27,245
ever since the day I met you.

412
00:16:27,329 --> 00:16:28,729
Well, she gave it to you,

413
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:32,333
and you just went and scored
a touchdown for the other team.

414
00:16:43,262 --> 00:16:46,914
Oh, my God.

415
00:16:46,965 --> 00:16:49,016
Your grandmother's apartment.

416
00:16:49,084 --> 00:16:51,469
I still own it.

417
00:16:51,553 --> 00:16:55,523
You kept it
this entire time?

418
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:57,808
I couldn't rent it.

419
00:16:57,893 --> 00:16:58,976
I couldn't sell it.

420
00:16:59,061 --> 00:17:01,112
I...

421
00:17:01,196 --> 00:17:02,563
Couldn't even come here.

422
00:17:02,614 --> 00:17:04,615
That means the last time
you were here...

423
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,951
We were here.

424
00:17:07,035 --> 00:17:08,619
So you want to move in here?

425
00:17:08,704 --> 00:17:10,621
I want us to move in here.

426
00:17:13,575 --> 00:17:15,409
- Mike--
- Rachel.

427
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:17,912
I've only ever been here twice,

428
00:17:17,963 --> 00:17:21,115
and both times were with you.

429
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:23,584
The first time we stood here,

430
00:17:23,635 --> 00:17:26,954
and we pictured
living together.

431
00:17:27,005 --> 00:17:29,507
I'll never forget that.

432
00:17:29,591 --> 00:17:32,977
- Neither will I.
- And the second time...

433
00:17:33,061 --> 00:17:36,147
Was one of the hardest days
of my life,

434
00:17:36,231 --> 00:17:40,017
but I got through it
because we were together.

435
00:17:45,407 --> 00:17:48,993
That's one the sweetest things
I've ever heard.

436
00:17:53,248 --> 00:17:56,617
You don't have to answer
right now, okay?

437
00:17:56,668 --> 00:18:00,421
I just wanted to show you
what we could have.

438
00:18:07,763 --> 00:18:10,047
Goddamn Louis.

439
00:18:10,132 --> 00:18:11,665
Let it go.

440
00:18:11,717 --> 00:18:13,050
Let it go?

441
00:18:13,135 --> 00:18:14,602
You don't say "let it go"

442
00:18:14,669 --> 00:18:16,854
unless you already
didn't let it go.

443
00:18:16,938 --> 00:18:19,473
You gonna take it out on me
for taking it out on him?

444
00:18:19,524 --> 00:18:21,275
At the moment,
we don't have the time.

445
00:18:21,342 --> 00:18:22,810
Good, because
I've already got Mike

446
00:18:22,861 --> 00:18:24,695
looking for ways
to revise the agreement.

447
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:26,113
The problem
isn't revising it.

448
00:18:26,181 --> 00:18:28,065
The problem is
Louis already signed it.

449
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:29,784
You're saying
we need to find a loophole.

450
00:18:29,851 --> 00:18:31,035
I am.

451
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:32,653
Well, if we can't steal
from their clients

452
00:18:32,704 --> 00:18:34,622
and the revenues from new ones
don't count,

453
00:18:34,689 --> 00:18:36,157
what the hell
are we supposed to do?

454
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:37,792
There's only one thing
to do--

455
00:18:37,859 --> 00:18:39,299
look at the money
we're already owed.

456
00:18:39,327 --> 00:18:41,879
- I don't follow you.
- We're on a cash basis.

457
00:18:41,963 --> 00:18:44,531
We can't count the revenues
we haven't collected yet.

458
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:47,367
But if we can entice someone
to pay us sooner,

459
00:18:47,419 --> 00:18:49,387
we can get that revenue in
under the window.

460
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:51,038
Bad faith--
I like it.

461
00:18:51,089 --> 00:18:52,930
The question is,
who still owes us enough money

462
00:18:53,008 --> 00:18:54,374
to make a difference?

463
00:18:54,426 --> 00:18:55,542
Folsom Foods.

464
00:18:55,594 --> 00:18:56,877
The second they pay
their settlement,

465
00:18:56,928 --> 00:18:58,095
we get paid our fee.

466
00:18:58,180 --> 00:18:59,563
You came to that
all on your own.

467
00:18:59,648 --> 00:19:02,349
Yeah, about an hour ago.
Don't tell me I beat you to it.

468
00:19:02,401 --> 00:19:04,401
Maybe. But you didn't have
Harvey slowing you down.

469
00:19:04,403 --> 00:19:06,270
- That's a fair point.
- Okay, I'm right here.

470
00:19:06,354 --> 00:19:08,055
Well, your idea is no good,

471
00:19:08,106 --> 00:19:09,573
because it'll be
a cold day in hell

472
00:19:09,658 --> 00:19:12,109
before Daniel Hardman lifts
a finger to help this firm,

473
00:19:12,194 --> 00:19:14,278
and I'd rather lose
this negotiation

474
00:19:14,362 --> 00:19:16,082
than to cut a deal
with that son of a bitch.

475
00:19:16,164 --> 00:19:18,232
You don't have to.
Hardman was running point.

476
00:19:18,283 --> 00:19:20,901
Folsom's not his client.
They're Robert Zane's.

477
00:19:20,952 --> 00:19:23,537
- He's no fan of us either.
- Maybe not.

478
00:19:23,588 --> 00:19:27,124
But we can handle
Robert Zane.

479
00:19:29,261 --> 00:19:31,245
You caught on
to my plan there.

480
00:19:31,296 --> 00:19:33,247
You mean the most obvious
plan in the world?

481
00:19:33,298 --> 00:19:35,378
I mean the plan that
I thought of and that you didn't

482
00:19:35,383 --> 00:19:37,251
and that I'm the perfect
person to implement.

483
00:19:37,302 --> 00:19:39,353
You really think
you can handle Robert Zane?

484
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:40,721
I have a relationship
with him.

485
00:19:40,772 --> 00:19:42,089
Yeah. You're sleeping
with his daughter.

486
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:43,607
I'm sure
he's your biggest fan.

487
00:19:43,692 --> 00:19:46,777
Okay, it's not like that.
I had dinner at the man's house.

488
00:19:46,862 --> 00:19:48,145
I had dinner
at the White House.

489
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:49,763
They're not gonna make me
Attorney General.

490
00:19:49,815 --> 00:19:51,431
Okay, first of all,
bullshit.

491
00:19:51,483 --> 00:19:53,084
Second of all,
do you have a better idea?

492
00:19:53,118 --> 00:19:54,434
No, I don't.

493
00:19:54,486 --> 00:19:56,370
But are you ready to use
your relationship with Rachel

494
00:19:56,437 --> 00:19:57,788
to get her father to turn?

495
00:19:57,873 --> 00:19:59,790
Doesn't matter,
because I'm not gonna do that.

496
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:01,909
I'm just gonna use it
to get him to hear me out

497
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:04,662
in the first place.
Good luck with that.

498
00:20:04,746 --> 00:20:08,666
Hey, how'd you know that
White House thing was bullshit?

499
00:20:16,341 --> 00:20:19,126
Mike. I was wondering when
I was gonna get you out here.

500
00:20:19,177 --> 00:20:20,460
Ah, golf isn't really
my thing.

501
00:20:20,512 --> 00:20:22,596
What is your thing?

502
00:20:22,647 --> 00:20:24,798
- Sports.
- You're telling me

503
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:26,817
you're one of those guys
that doesn't think

504
00:20:26,902 --> 00:20:28,352
golf is a sport?
Of course not.

505
00:20:28,436 --> 00:20:31,322
I can tell you're an athlete
just by looking at you, sir.

506
00:20:31,406 --> 00:20:33,691
With an attitude like that,
you must be here on business.

507
00:20:33,775 --> 00:20:35,159
- Folsom Foods.
- Ah...

508
00:20:35,243 --> 00:20:37,311
You're gonna stick that loss
in my face?

509
00:20:37,362 --> 00:20:39,530
No, I'm here to make
that loss sting a little less.

510
00:20:39,614 --> 00:20:41,982
You move up your payment
by one fiscal quarter,

511
00:20:42,033 --> 00:20:44,502
we'll take a 10% haircut
on our fee.

512
00:20:44,586 --> 00:20:46,921
- 10% is a little light.
- All right.

513
00:20:46,988 --> 00:20:49,340
I'll cut right to it.
I can go as high as 20%.

514
00:20:49,424 --> 00:20:50,490
Are you saying 20%?

515
00:20:50,542 --> 00:20:52,326
Yes.

516
00:20:52,377 --> 00:20:54,828
Then I'm saying no.

517
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,515
Sir, this...
This is a win for you.

518
00:20:57,599 --> 00:20:59,767
No, this isn't shit
for me.

519
00:20:59,834 --> 00:21:02,436
This is about Harvey Specter
and Jessica Pearson

520
00:21:02,503 --> 00:21:04,004
and their divorce negotiations.

521
00:21:04,055 --> 00:21:06,340
And you don't go
to the one you didn't marry

522
00:21:06,391 --> 00:21:08,058
to stick it
to the one you did.

523
00:21:08,143 --> 00:21:10,177
We could go
straight to your client.

524
00:21:10,228 --> 00:21:11,845
By the time
they accepted the offer,

525
00:21:11,897 --> 00:21:13,397
it'd be too late.

526
00:21:13,481 --> 00:21:15,349
You just gave that away
when you went straight to 20%.

527
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,701
I went straight to 20%
out of respect.

528
00:21:17,786 --> 00:21:20,738
Now you're repaying me
by being a--

529
00:21:20,822 --> 00:21:22,022
What?

530
00:21:22,073 --> 00:21:23,824
You don't have the balls
to say it.

531
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:25,242
I will.

532
00:21:25,327 --> 00:21:27,527
A dick.
I'm being a dick.

533
00:21:27,579 --> 00:21:30,697
The question is,
what are you gonna do about it?

534
00:21:32,217 --> 00:21:35,002
I'm not gonna do
anything about it.

535
00:21:35,053 --> 00:21:36,887
I just wonder
what your daughter's gonna think

536
00:21:36,972 --> 00:21:38,806
when she finds out
you screwed over your own client

537
00:21:38,873 --> 00:21:40,591
just to stick it
to the man she loves.

538
00:21:40,675 --> 00:21:42,542
She loves Harvey Specter.

539
00:21:42,594 --> 00:21:44,478
No.

540
00:21:44,545 --> 00:21:48,148
But when you go after Harvey,
you go after me.

541
00:22:00,977 --> 00:22:02,649
The Whooping Crane
of Manchuria.

542
00:22:03,114 --> 00:22:05,365
- It's my calming animal.
- You've chosen well.

543
00:22:07,668 --> 00:22:09,586
What can I do for you,
Katrina?

544
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:11,738
- I never heard back from you.
- About what?

545
00:22:11,789 --> 00:22:13,239
About anything...

546
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:15,959
Especially what we're going
to do about negotiations.

547
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:17,761
There's no more negotiation.

548
00:22:17,845 --> 00:22:19,596
I had one assignment,
and I blew it.

549
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:23,082
Louis, the opera isn't over
until the fat lady sings.

550
00:22:23,134 --> 00:22:25,552
No, this is not the opera.

551
00:22:25,603 --> 00:22:27,304
It's football.

552
00:22:27,388 --> 00:22:28,638
Harvey said it.

553
00:22:28,723 --> 00:22:30,223
They gave me the ball.

554
00:22:30,274 --> 00:22:31,892
I scored a touchdown
for the other team,

555
00:22:31,943 --> 00:22:33,109
it's the eighth inning,

556
00:22:33,194 --> 00:22:35,228
and there's no more time
left on the clock.

557
00:22:35,279 --> 00:22:36,897
I never thought
I'd hear you say that.

558
00:22:36,948 --> 00:22:38,431
It's the fact.
There's nothing we can do.

559
00:22:38,483 --> 00:22:39,616
I signed the agreement,

560
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:41,201
and Nigel's
never gonna reopen it.

561
00:22:41,268 --> 00:22:44,938
Well, then I guess it's
a good thing I found a loophole.

562
00:22:44,989 --> 00:22:46,490
What are you talking about?

563
00:22:46,574 --> 00:22:48,124
We can't steal
their clients,

564
00:22:48,209 --> 00:22:50,327
but we can still increase
our revenue.

565
00:22:50,411 --> 00:22:51,945
No. New clients
don't count.

566
00:22:51,996 --> 00:22:53,463
I'm not talking
about new clients.

567
00:22:53,548 --> 00:22:56,449
I'm talking about new revenue
from clients we already have.

568
00:22:56,501 --> 00:22:58,752
Well, that's operating
in complete bad faith.

569
00:23:01,288 --> 00:23:02,849
Now, what clients
are you talking about.

570
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:04,591
First, I got you something.

571
00:23:04,642 --> 00:23:06,793
Okay, Katrina,
you know what?

572
00:23:06,844 --> 00:23:09,513
I really don't have time
for sentimental--

573
00:23:13,017 --> 00:23:14,985
The trademark came through
ten minutes ago.

574
00:23:15,069 --> 00:23:17,354
I...
Don't know what to say.

575
00:23:17,438 --> 00:23:18,939
Say you forgive me

576
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:20,740
for letting you
lose control of Nigel.

577
00:23:23,411 --> 00:23:24,661
I do.

578
00:23:26,914 --> 00:23:29,833
Now, let's go get
some goddamn new revenue.

579
00:23:38,926 --> 00:23:40,460
You.

580
00:23:40,511 --> 00:23:41,795
How'd you get in here?

581
00:23:41,846 --> 00:23:43,663
'Cause I know
how to get things done.

582
00:23:43,714 --> 00:23:44,998
You didn't
the last time we met.

583
00:23:45,049 --> 00:23:46,499
Last time you saw me
coming a mile away.

584
00:23:46,551 --> 00:23:48,218
This time,
I'm blindsiding you.

585
00:23:50,104 --> 00:23:53,006
- I didn't know we were at war.
- We're not.

586
00:23:53,057 --> 00:23:54,524
It's just a training exercise.

587
00:23:56,176 --> 00:23:57,861
These are my personal
bank statements.

588
00:23:57,945 --> 00:23:59,863
You stole my money.

589
00:23:59,947 --> 00:24:01,481
No, not stole...

590
00:24:01,532 --> 00:24:02,682
Relocated.

591
00:24:02,733 --> 00:24:04,701
- I could have you arrested.
- You could.

592
00:24:04,785 --> 00:24:07,571
But then you'd be missing out
on all this...

593
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:12,158
Tax shelter in the Caymans,

594
00:24:12,209 --> 00:24:14,529
carried interest classification
for your personal holdings,

595
00:24:14,579 --> 00:24:17,247
blind irrevocable trust for up
to six of your unborn children.

596
00:24:17,331 --> 00:24:19,082
- And this means...
- You'll never pay

597
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:20,750
a nickel in taxes
your entire life,

598
00:24:20,835 --> 00:24:22,555
not to mention your money
will be too secure

599
00:24:22,587 --> 00:24:25,922
for someone to do
what I just did.

600
00:24:26,007 --> 00:24:27,707
How'd you do all this?

601
00:24:27,758 --> 00:24:29,392
Well, you said you'd call us
for the paperwork.

602
00:24:29,477 --> 00:24:31,428
This is how I do paperwork.
Oh, and one last thing--

603
00:24:31,512 --> 00:24:33,229
that Ferrari
that your ex-wife took?

604
00:24:33,314 --> 00:24:35,432
Yeah?

605
00:24:35,516 --> 00:24:37,267
I got it back.

606
00:24:40,154 --> 00:24:41,771
You're hired.

607
00:24:44,692 --> 00:24:46,610
Don't you need to get
board approval?

608
00:24:46,694 --> 00:24:48,745
To be my personal attorney?

609
00:24:48,829 --> 00:24:50,396
No, for
Gianopolous Limited Holdings

610
00:24:50,448 --> 00:24:53,066
to expand their relationship
with us.

611
00:24:53,117 --> 00:24:54,751
- Are you crazy?
- How is that crazy?

612
00:24:54,835 --> 00:24:56,503
I just showed you
what I'm capable of.

613
00:24:56,570 --> 00:24:58,788
You showed me you could beat
a tribe of Visigoths.

614
00:24:58,873 --> 00:25:01,174
You want me to give you control
of the Roman Empire?

615
00:25:01,241 --> 00:25:03,510
I can handle
the Roman Empire.

616
00:25:03,577 --> 00:25:04,961
Even if you could,

617
00:25:05,046 --> 00:25:07,631
from Mr. Gianopolous's
perspective,

618
00:25:07,715 --> 00:25:09,966
you're a nobody.

619
00:25:11,636 --> 00:25:15,421
Please, can you at least find
a way to convince him?

620
00:25:15,473 --> 00:25:17,256
I'm sorry.

621
00:25:17,308 --> 00:25:18,692
If I bring your name
up to him,

622
00:25:18,759 --> 00:25:20,393
he will laugh me
out of the room.

623
00:25:30,037 --> 00:25:31,871
That's a check
from Folsom Foods.

624
00:25:31,939 --> 00:25:34,040
It's the remainder
of what they owe us.

625
00:25:34,108 --> 00:25:36,876
Holy shit.
That's all of it.

626
00:25:36,944 --> 00:25:39,546
It's hard to believe that
you could get Zane to do this

627
00:25:39,613 --> 00:25:41,133
without using
his daughter against him.

628
00:25:41,215 --> 00:25:42,782
Maybe I'm
an excellent negotiator.

629
00:25:42,833 --> 00:25:44,384
If you're
an excellent negotiator,

630
00:25:44,451 --> 00:25:46,452
this wouldn't include
a 20% haircut.

631
00:25:46,504 --> 00:25:48,505
It would be 10%,
like I would have gotten.

632
00:25:48,589 --> 00:25:50,390
You? He wouldn't have
even talked to you.

633
00:25:50,457 --> 00:25:53,126
Like you're not talking
to me right now?

634
00:25:53,177 --> 00:25:55,061
What'd you say to Zane?

635
00:25:55,129 --> 00:25:58,631
Let's just say we may have
gotten what we wanted, but...

636
00:25:58,683 --> 00:26:01,101
My girlfriend's dad's gonna be
pissed at me for a little while.

637
00:26:01,152 --> 00:26:03,520
Then you're a better
negotiator than I thought.

638
00:26:22,673 --> 00:26:24,374
I never should have
given you my key.

639
00:26:24,458 --> 00:26:26,176
And I never
should have forgotten

640
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:28,494
that you'll stop at nothing
to beat me.

641
00:26:28,546 --> 00:26:29,996
No, you shouldn't have.

642
00:26:30,047 --> 00:26:31,347
Harvey...

643
00:26:31,432 --> 00:26:33,266
The man that I knew
may have fought to the death,

644
00:26:33,333 --> 00:26:35,635
but he always operated
in good faith.

645
00:26:35,686 --> 00:26:38,188
I told you, I am not bound
by good faith on this deal

646
00:26:38,272 --> 00:26:39,723
after what your boss did.

647
00:26:39,807 --> 00:26:41,891
It's not just Edward's firm.

648
00:26:41,976 --> 00:26:43,109
What does that
have to do with it?

649
00:26:43,177 --> 00:26:44,498
What does that
have to do with it?

650
00:26:44,528 --> 00:26:46,362
You shrunk the whole pie
for the sole purpose

651
00:26:46,447 --> 00:26:48,114
of getting a bigger piece
for yourself,

652
00:26:48,182 --> 00:26:49,622
and it screwed me,
along with Edward.

653
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:51,785
What do you want, Scottie?

654
00:26:51,852 --> 00:26:53,787
I want you to exclude
the Folsom Foods payments

655
00:26:53,854 --> 00:26:55,905
from the settlement
calculations.

656
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:59,075
And why would I do that?

657
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,660
Because I need you to.

658
00:27:00,711 --> 00:27:03,463
I'm afraid that's not enough.

659
00:27:05,866 --> 00:27:07,917
You, uh--
you came to me.

660
00:27:08,002 --> 00:27:09,419
You needed help
with Ava Hessington

661
00:27:09,503 --> 00:27:11,588
after you sent me back
to London.

662
00:27:11,672 --> 00:27:13,152
You said that I mean
something to you,

663
00:27:13,207 --> 00:27:16,259
that I'll--I'll always
mean something to you.

664
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:18,394
Was that bullshit or not?
It wasn't bullshit,

665
00:27:18,479 --> 00:27:20,180
and if you're in trouble
personally--

666
00:27:20,231 --> 00:27:22,682
I am in trouble personally.
You said so yourself.

667
00:27:22,733 --> 00:27:26,219
Our house is on fire,
and it's my job to put it out.

668
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:27,904
If you crush me...

669
00:27:27,988 --> 00:27:29,689
I'll have nothing.

670
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:31,658
That's not personal.
That's business.

671
00:27:31,725 --> 00:27:33,409
Okay,
let's talk business.

672
00:27:33,494 --> 00:27:36,579
You made a career out
of putting I.O.U.s in the bank.

673
00:27:36,664 --> 00:27:38,414
Do the same thing right now.

674
00:27:38,499 --> 00:27:41,167
Put an I.O.U. in with me.

675
00:27:41,235 --> 00:27:42,401
And what's to stop you

676
00:27:42,453 --> 00:27:45,922
from still trying
to screw me after that?

677
00:27:46,006 --> 00:27:47,874
My word that I won't.

678
00:27:55,848 --> 00:27:57,300
He asked you
to move in together?

679
00:27:57,301 --> 00:27:58,918
- I know. It's...
- Quick?

680
00:28:01,196 --> 00:28:04,863
I was going to say
that it's a-a big step,

681
00:28:04,864 --> 00:28:06,165
because it's not
really that quick.

682
00:28:06,216 --> 00:28:07,716
We've known each other
for a while.

683
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:10,169
Yes, but you only
just started dating.

684
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:12,087
So I guess that means
you're against it.

685
00:28:12,172 --> 00:28:14,389
Rachel,
I'm not against it.

686
00:28:14,474 --> 00:28:15,807
You told me that you love him,

687
00:28:15,875 --> 00:28:17,593
and I couldn't be happier
for you.

688
00:28:17,677 --> 00:28:20,679
But you got a lot
going on right now.

689
00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:22,931
You don't even know where
you're gonna go to law school.

690
00:28:22,932 --> 00:28:24,382
I'm just saying

691
00:28:24,434 --> 00:28:27,019
maybe you don't want to rush
into this so quickly.

692
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:29,354
Rush into what?

693
00:28:34,527 --> 00:28:37,446
Well, Mike asked me
to move in with him.

694
00:28:37,530 --> 00:28:39,448
Move in with him?

695
00:28:39,532 --> 00:28:41,950
Shit, what's he gonna
do to me then?

696
00:28:42,035 --> 00:28:44,703
- What are you talking about?
- You didn't hear?

697
00:28:44,754 --> 00:28:46,255
He came to me
on the golf course.

698
00:28:46,339 --> 00:28:47,789
To ask for permission?

699
00:28:47,874 --> 00:28:51,260
No, he didn't ask for shit.

700
00:28:51,344 --> 00:28:53,745
I got to hand it to him.
The boy's got some balls.

701
00:28:53,796 --> 00:28:55,631
- What?
- He kicked my ass.

702
00:28:55,715 --> 00:28:57,549
Didn't even have the courtesy
to give me a--

703
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,884
- Robert!
- Oh, come on.

704
00:28:58,935 --> 00:29:01,386
She's gonna be a lawyer.
Gonna hear a lot worse.

705
00:29:01,437 --> 00:29:03,438
Dad, what are you talking
about--what happened?

706
00:29:03,523 --> 00:29:06,225
He wanted an advance
on the Folsom settlement.

707
00:29:06,276 --> 00:29:08,360
And he put the screws to me
to get it.

708
00:29:08,427 --> 00:29:10,862
He put the screws
to you how?

709
00:29:16,653 --> 00:29:18,737
Rachel.
This is a surprise.

710
00:29:18,788 --> 00:29:21,240
What happened to--
Tess in a bedsheet?

711
00:29:21,291 --> 00:29:25,110
It was replaced by the image
of you manipulating my dad.

712
00:29:25,161 --> 00:29:26,945
Okay, I did not manipulate
your dad.

713
00:29:26,996 --> 00:29:28,664
How exactly
would you describe it?

714
00:29:28,748 --> 00:29:31,133
I didn't go there
to manipulate him, all right?

715
00:29:31,217 --> 00:29:32,578
He--he was about to make
a decision

716
00:29:32,585 --> 00:29:34,419
that was going to affect him,
us, and his client,

717
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:35,671
and I just pointed that out
to him.

718
00:29:35,755 --> 00:29:37,222
And then when
that didn't work,

719
00:29:37,290 --> 00:29:38,623
you pointed out
that I wouldn't approve.

720
00:29:38,675 --> 00:29:39,641
He was bullying me.

721
00:29:39,726 --> 00:29:42,728
So you used me
to bully him back.

722
00:29:42,795 --> 00:29:45,347
I was talking to my mom
about moving in with you

723
00:29:45,431 --> 00:29:48,100
when I found out about this.
Okay, Rachel...

724
00:29:48,151 --> 00:29:50,602
I'm sorry, all right?

725
00:29:50,653 --> 00:29:52,487
Let me call him right now.
I'll apologize to him--

726
00:29:52,572 --> 00:29:53,739
Him?

727
00:29:53,806 --> 00:29:55,691
He loved it!
He did?

728
00:29:55,775 --> 00:29:57,609
Yeah, he thought
you had balls.

729
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:59,778
- So then what's the problem?
- Are you not listening to me?

730
00:29:59,829 --> 00:30:01,646
I was thinking
about moving in with you,

731
00:30:01,698 --> 00:30:03,865
and then I find out
that you go to my dad--

732
00:30:03,950 --> 00:30:05,334
Wait, wait, wait.
Are--

733
00:30:05,418 --> 00:30:07,669
are you saying
this changes everything?

734
00:30:07,754 --> 00:30:10,038
- It's complicated.
- What's complicated about it?

735
00:30:10,123 --> 00:30:11,656
Forget--I don't even want
to get into this

736
00:30:11,708 --> 00:30:13,208
with you right now!
Rachel, if you don't want

737
00:30:13,293 --> 00:30:14,659
to live with me,
why don't you just tell me

738
00:30:14,711 --> 00:30:17,879
you don't want to live with me?
I didn't say that.

739
00:30:17,964 --> 00:30:19,798
Well, do you?

740
00:30:24,887 --> 00:30:28,056
You said I could have
some time, so...

741
00:30:30,476 --> 00:30:32,894
I just need some time.

742
00:30:49,212 --> 00:30:51,913
You excluded
the Folsom Foods payment

743
00:30:51,998 --> 00:30:53,698
from the revenue totals
on this.

744
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:55,834
It's a draft document.
I haven't showed it to anyone.

745
00:30:55,885 --> 00:30:57,202
I just wanted
to run it by you.

746
00:30:57,253 --> 00:30:59,171
Well, what reason
could you possibly have

747
00:30:59,222 --> 00:31:00,922
for wanting to do it at all?

748
00:31:01,007 --> 00:31:02,591
Because Scottie
came to me and asked,

749
00:31:02,675 --> 00:31:04,226
and I think
it's good business.

750
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:05,550
Well, your idea
of good business

751
00:31:05,561 --> 00:31:06,878
is different from mine,

752
00:31:06,929 --> 00:31:09,514
because we already took
less money from Folsom Foods,

753
00:31:09,565 --> 00:31:11,650
and now you want us to take
less money from Darby.

754
00:31:11,717 --> 00:31:14,219
Jessica,
if we screw him over,

755
00:31:14,270 --> 00:31:15,904
he's gonna come back at us.

756
00:31:15,988 --> 00:31:17,222
It might not be tomorrow.

757
00:31:17,273 --> 00:31:18,774
It might not be six months
from now,

758
00:31:18,858 --> 00:31:20,525
but he's gonna find a way.

759
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:22,778
- You mean she'll find a way.
- That's exactly what I mean.

760
00:31:22,862 --> 00:31:24,413
And maybe she will.

761
00:31:24,497 --> 00:31:26,731
But I've never known you
to run from a fight before.

762
00:31:26,783 --> 00:31:28,733
My name was never
on the door before.

763
00:31:28,785 --> 00:31:30,869
You said it yourself.

764
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:34,206
I have to think differently
now that I'm in this position.

765
00:31:34,257 --> 00:31:35,907
I did say that.

766
00:31:35,958 --> 00:31:37,426
And it's not just gonna
be one fight.

767
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:40,178
It's gonna be the Hatfields
and the McCoys all over again.

768
00:31:40,246 --> 00:31:43,415
Are you sure this isn't really
about your history with her?

769
00:31:43,466 --> 00:31:46,635
- What if it is?
- She could just be playing us.

770
00:31:46,719 --> 00:31:50,088
She could, but...
I trust her.

771
00:31:51,557 --> 00:31:53,591
Jessica,
it's time to turn the page.

772
00:31:56,446 --> 00:31:58,480
Well, I don't want
to turn the page.

773
00:31:58,564 --> 00:32:01,066
I want to close the book.

774
00:32:01,117 --> 00:32:04,769
Tell her we'll exclude
the payment and honor our deal.

775
00:32:10,326 --> 00:32:13,295
Louis, I know it didn't go
exactly as planned,

776
00:32:13,379 --> 00:32:16,331
but you need to pick yourself up
and dust yourself off.

777
00:32:16,416 --> 00:32:18,116
Exactly as planned?

778
00:32:18,167 --> 00:32:20,335
I utterly failed.

779
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:22,287
I don't even deserve
this stupid mug.

780
00:32:22,338 --> 00:32:24,089
"Litt Up"?
It should say "shit up."

781
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:25,640
You didn't fail.
You impressed him.

782
00:32:25,725 --> 00:32:28,844
Yeah, that and $45 will get
my cat a Brazilian bikini wax.

783
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:30,178
You got a new cat?

784
00:32:30,263 --> 00:32:31,796
Fostering.

785
00:32:31,848 --> 00:32:33,899
Louis...enough.

786
00:32:33,966 --> 00:32:36,435
You need to go to Harvey.

787
00:32:36,486 --> 00:32:38,987
You mean tell him that I'm
even more of an embarrassment

788
00:32:39,071 --> 00:32:40,638
than he says I am?

789
00:32:40,690 --> 00:32:42,441
You're not an embarrassment.

790
00:32:42,492 --> 00:32:44,443
You may need Harvey
to put the ball in the end zone,

791
00:32:44,494 --> 00:32:46,027
but you had the idea,
you set it up,

792
00:32:46,112 --> 00:32:48,480
and you drove the ball
down to the one-yard line.

793
00:32:48,531 --> 00:32:50,365
No, I didn't have the idea.

794
00:32:50,450 --> 00:32:51,867
You had the idea!

795
00:32:51,951 --> 00:32:53,919
And you executed it.

796
00:32:53,986 --> 00:32:55,537
But you're giving me credit.

797
00:32:55,621 --> 00:32:57,822
If Harvey executes this,
he'll give you credit.

798
00:32:57,874 --> 00:32:59,508
No, he won't.
He never does.

799
00:32:59,592 --> 00:33:01,209
Louis, he might.

800
00:33:01,294 --> 00:33:03,512
You want him to see
a different side of you,

801
00:33:03,596 --> 00:33:05,663
give him a chance to show
a different side of him.

802
00:33:05,715 --> 00:33:07,549
You know what?
It doesn't matter anyway.

803
00:33:07,633 --> 00:33:09,468
Harvey doesn't need
my help anymore.

804
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:11,336
It's too late.
No, it isn't.

805
00:33:11,387 --> 00:33:13,138
Haven't you heard?

806
00:33:13,189 --> 00:33:15,390
Heard what?

807
00:33:31,524 --> 00:33:33,375
Harvey,
I have some bad news.

808
00:33:33,459 --> 00:33:35,577
- What is it?
- I think you should sit down.

809
00:33:35,661 --> 00:33:38,046
Donna, unless someone died,
I don't need to sit down.

810
00:33:38,130 --> 00:33:41,383
Just tell me.
Hessington Oil just fired us.

811
00:33:48,474 --> 00:33:50,709
- Scottie betrayed me.
- You don't know that.

812
00:33:50,776 --> 00:33:52,844
One plus one equals two,
Donna.

813
00:33:52,895 --> 00:33:54,563
And I know
how to goddamn add.

814
00:33:54,647 --> 00:33:55,897
I didn't count
the Folsom money,

815
00:33:55,982 --> 00:33:58,066
and suddenly
our oil revenues are gone

816
00:33:58,150 --> 00:34:00,235
and her piece of the pie
just skyrocketed.

817
00:34:00,319 --> 00:34:02,220
Harvey, please,
don't do anything rash.

818
00:34:02,271 --> 00:34:04,222
What the hell
are you saying?

819
00:34:04,273 --> 00:34:06,441
- I'm saying call her.
- How would that go?

820
00:34:06,526 --> 00:34:08,243
"Hey, Scottie,
thanks for dicking me over.

821
00:34:08,327 --> 00:34:09,578
Could you please
take it back?"

822
00:34:09,662 --> 00:34:11,196
You don't know
how it would go.

823
00:34:11,247 --> 00:34:13,415
And you could find out
if you would drop your pride

824
00:34:13,499 --> 00:34:15,179
and just give her
the benefit of the doubt.

825
00:34:15,201 --> 00:34:17,235
You gave someone
the benefit of the doubt,

826
00:34:17,286 --> 00:34:18,837
and look how that turned out.

827
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:23,041
You think just because
you bought me a handbag,

828
00:34:23,092 --> 00:34:26,011
you can say that to me?

829
00:34:26,078 --> 00:34:27,712
Okay, I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have said that.

830
00:34:27,763 --> 00:34:29,297
But I just got played,

831
00:34:29,382 --> 00:34:32,133
and I'm not about to call
Scottie and cry about it.

832
00:34:32,218 --> 00:34:34,219
- So what are you gonna do?
- I'm gonna figure out

833
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:36,805
how to do to her
what she just did to me.

834
00:34:44,937 --> 00:34:46,058
- Harvey.
- Not now, Louis.

835
00:34:46,138 --> 00:34:47,590
Yes, now, Harvey.
I've got the answer.

836
00:34:47,591 --> 00:34:48,912
- The answer to what?
- To shoving

837
00:34:48,959 --> 00:34:50,927
the Hessington Oil firing
up Edward Darby's ass.

838
00:34:51,514 --> 00:34:52,881
Harvey.

839
00:34:52,932 --> 00:34:54,582
Harvey!

840
00:34:56,085 --> 00:34:57,853
Tony Gianopolous.

841
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,522
He can triple the revenue
we lost with Hessington Oil.

842
00:35:00,589 --> 00:35:02,924
And they're technically
not a new client.

843
00:35:02,976 --> 00:35:04,943
So there's nothing
Scottie can do.

844
00:35:05,028 --> 00:35:06,445
Well, what makes you think
he's gonna go for it?

845
00:35:06,529 --> 00:35:08,930
Because I went there,
and they are primed to say yes.

846
00:35:08,982 --> 00:35:11,783
They just won't...

847
00:35:11,868 --> 00:35:14,736
They just won't
say yes to me.

848
00:35:14,787 --> 00:35:18,156
Give him this.
They'll say yes to you.

849
00:35:23,663 --> 00:35:25,580
Louis, this is brilliant.

850
00:35:25,632 --> 00:35:28,250
And if you hadn't had the balls
to come to me,

851
00:35:28,301 --> 00:35:29,751
we'd have nothing
right now.

852
00:35:29,802 --> 00:35:31,219
Harvey, no.

853
00:35:31,287 --> 00:35:32,671
I should have come
to you sooner,

854
00:35:32,755 --> 00:35:34,622
but I didn't because I just--
Louis.

855
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:36,425
I've told you this before,

856
00:35:36,476 --> 00:35:39,127
but it's always been when
I needed something from you.

857
00:35:39,178 --> 00:35:41,963
And I don't need anything
from you right now,

858
00:35:42,015 --> 00:35:43,465
because you just gave it to me.

859
00:35:43,516 --> 00:35:46,935
So maybe you can hear it
when I say it--

860
00:35:46,986 --> 00:35:50,272
I respect you.

861
00:35:50,323 --> 00:35:52,140
You're an excellent attorney,

862
00:35:52,191 --> 00:35:55,027
a valuable member
of this firm.

863
00:35:57,246 --> 00:35:58,497
And a friend?

864
00:35:58,581 --> 00:36:00,315
Don't push it.

865
00:36:02,035 --> 00:36:03,485
Sorry.

866
00:36:03,536 --> 00:36:07,372
Seriously, Harvey,
I just have to say, um...

867
00:36:09,375 --> 00:36:11,460
It means so much
when you say all that.

868
00:36:11,511 --> 00:36:12,878
Do you need a tissue
or something?

869
00:36:12,962 --> 00:36:15,013
- Can I use your pocket square?
- Under no circumstances.

870
00:36:15,098 --> 00:36:17,432
I'll be fine.
And you and Jessica

871
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,851
need to take that over
to Gianopolous right now.

872
00:36:19,936 --> 00:36:22,837
Screw that.
I'm going over there with you.

873
00:36:29,812 --> 00:36:31,229
He's not there.

874
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:32,481
What?
Where is he?

875
00:36:32,532 --> 00:36:34,682
He went to see
Tony Gianopolous.

876
00:36:34,734 --> 00:36:36,735
- By himself?
- No, with Louis.

877
00:36:36,819 --> 00:36:38,987
With Louis?
What, is he mad at me?

878
00:36:39,038 --> 00:36:41,039
Rachel's the only one
who's mad at you.

879
00:36:42,691 --> 00:36:43,909
- She told you.
- She didn't have to.

880
00:36:43,993 --> 00:36:45,410
What were you thinking,

881
00:36:45,495 --> 00:36:46,878
pulling all that shit
with her dad?

882
00:36:46,963 --> 00:36:48,547
I didn't think
it would come to that.

883
00:36:48,631 --> 00:36:50,082
He didn't mind.
Why should she?

884
00:36:51,417 --> 00:36:53,585
Anyone who understands women
in any way

885
00:36:53,669 --> 00:36:55,887
would know that was
a bad idea from the start.

886
00:36:55,972 --> 00:36:58,056
- Harvey liked it.
- Proving my point.

887
00:37:01,427 --> 00:37:03,061
I asked her
to move in with me.

888
00:37:03,146 --> 00:37:04,379
I know.

889
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:05,547
She told you?

890
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:07,048
Of course she did.

891
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:09,217
I can't intuit everything.
What am I, the Dalai Lama?

892
00:37:09,268 --> 00:37:11,436
Donna, you should have seen
her face when I asked her.

893
00:37:11,521 --> 00:37:13,522
She was so happy.

894
00:37:13,573 --> 00:37:15,223
I'm sure she was.
It was very romantic.

895
00:37:15,274 --> 00:37:17,442
How could she be so happy
and then just not want to do it?

896
00:37:17,527 --> 00:37:19,894
Who says
she doesn't want to do it?

897
00:37:19,946 --> 00:37:21,729
I told her to take her time,

898
00:37:21,781 --> 00:37:23,731
but I-I didn't think
she'd need it.

899
00:37:23,783 --> 00:37:25,584
Why wouldn't she need it?

900
00:37:25,668 --> 00:37:27,669
Just because you made
some romantic gesture

901
00:37:27,736 --> 00:37:29,921
doesn't mean that all reason
goes out the window.

902
00:37:30,006 --> 00:37:31,673
I've had a pit in my stomach
since last night.

903
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:33,175
I...

904
00:37:33,242 --> 00:37:35,210
I need to do something.

905
00:37:35,261 --> 00:37:37,745
You need to look
in the mirror.

906
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:39,214
What?

907
00:37:40,516 --> 00:37:42,236
I just jumped into
a relationship with a man

908
00:37:42,268 --> 00:37:43,602
who, it turns out,

909
00:37:43,686 --> 00:37:45,437
was pretending to be
something he wasn't.

910
00:37:45,521 --> 00:37:46,938
Rachel already knows

911
00:37:47,023 --> 00:37:49,608
that you're pretending to be
something you're not.

912
00:37:49,692 --> 00:37:51,443
All you need to do
is just give her time

913
00:37:51,527 --> 00:37:52,927
to figure it all out.

914
00:37:54,564 --> 00:37:56,865
What if she says no?

915
00:37:56,932 --> 00:37:58,817
Then she says no.

916
00:37:58,901 --> 00:38:02,537
But pushing her isn't going
to stop that from happening.

917
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:09,123
If you're here to complain
about Hessington Oil,

918
00:38:09,128 --> 00:38:10,328
I had nothing to do with it.

919
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:11,580
I'm just
the majority shareholder.

920
00:38:11,631 --> 00:38:13,799
I don't get involved
in day-to-day stuff.

921
00:38:13,883 --> 00:38:16,334
- We're not here to complain.
- We're here to bring a gift.

922
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:17,969
The question is,
what do you get a man

923
00:38:18,054 --> 00:38:19,838
who can burn a $50,000 bond?

924
00:38:19,922 --> 00:38:22,474
Something money can't buy.

925
00:38:25,094 --> 00:38:27,462
- This isn't public.
- It will be in 48 hours.

926
00:38:27,513 --> 00:38:29,797
And it's legal now.
How do you know that?

927
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:31,316
Because I structured it
that way.

928
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:34,102
I can do more of the same
for you, but he didn't tell you,

929
00:38:34,153 --> 00:38:36,137
because I wasn't enough
of a name.

930
00:38:36,189 --> 00:38:38,440
- You're not.
- But I am.

931
00:38:38,491 --> 00:38:40,975
Well, you are, as a man
who shoots from the hip,

932
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:42,160
which I like, but--

933
00:38:42,245 --> 00:38:44,112
You also need
a stabilizing influence.

934
00:38:44,163 --> 00:38:46,865
- Not a football player.
- But a fan of the ballet.

935
00:38:46,949 --> 00:38:49,034
- Muscle.
- And finesse.

936
00:38:49,118 --> 00:38:51,253
And you guys think
that I'm not aware

937
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:53,371
that this is all
about your merger negotiations.

938
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:54,756
Oh, I was counting on you
being aware of it.

939
00:38:54,823 --> 00:38:56,007
Because then
you'll also be aware

940
00:38:56,092 --> 00:38:57,459
that we can be very flexible
in our billings.

941
00:38:57,510 --> 00:38:59,177
As long as I pay
enough up front

942
00:38:59,262 --> 00:39:00,929
to tip the scales
in your favor.

943
00:39:00,996 --> 00:39:02,464
We'll structure
a schedule that results

944
00:39:02,515 --> 00:39:04,165
in you getting a substantial
financial benefit.

945
00:39:04,217 --> 00:39:05,800
Which is his specialty.

946
00:39:05,852 --> 00:39:07,302
Go ahead.
Tell him.

947
00:39:07,353 --> 00:39:09,271
He's a badass.

948
00:39:11,357 --> 00:39:13,525
What do you say we celebrate
our new association

949
00:39:13,609 --> 00:39:16,394
over dinner in Chicago
with Michael Jordan?

950
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:18,196
We can take my private jet.

951
00:39:18,281 --> 00:39:20,198
Hey! Which will allow us
to pay for it

952
00:39:20,283 --> 00:39:21,849
and for you to write it off.

953
00:39:35,248 --> 00:39:37,249
Hey.

954
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:38,700
Hey.

955
00:39:38,751 --> 00:39:40,752
I know you're probably
busy...

956
00:39:40,836 --> 00:39:42,504
I'm actually not.

957
00:39:49,845 --> 00:39:52,213
Rachel, I...

958
00:39:52,265 --> 00:39:54,015
I know that dating me
is complicated--

959
00:39:54,066 --> 00:39:55,517
- Mike--
- I just--

960
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:00,855
I just want you to know you can
take as much time as you need.

961
00:40:03,743 --> 00:40:06,194
I love you.

962
00:40:09,665 --> 00:40:11,666
I love you too.

963
00:40:17,173 --> 00:40:19,907
I got into Stanford.

964
00:40:30,386 --> 00:40:33,271
What the hell
is wrong with you?

965
00:40:33,356 --> 00:40:35,256
I see you got
my little gut punch.

966
00:40:35,308 --> 00:40:37,759
I came to you hat in hand,
and this is what you do--

967
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:39,394
stack the numbers?
- Hat in hand?

968
00:40:39,445 --> 00:40:41,313
More like a wolf
in sheep's clothing.

969
00:40:41,397 --> 00:40:43,949
- What are you talking about?
- Hessington Oil.

970
00:40:44,033 --> 00:40:45,283
I had nothing
to do with that.

971
00:40:45,368 --> 00:40:47,319
Something dropped
from the sky,

972
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:48,703
tilted everything
in your favor

973
00:40:48,771 --> 00:40:50,989
right after I cut you a break?
I don't think so.

974
00:40:51,073 --> 00:40:53,658
Harvey, I gave you my word,
and I honored it.

975
00:40:53,743 --> 00:40:55,109
Bullshit.
You're saying saying that

976
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:56,401
because I've got
the upper hand.

977
00:40:56,412 --> 00:40:57,746
This is not
about the upper hand.

978
00:40:57,797 --> 00:40:59,158
You're always
about the upper hand!

979
00:40:59,165 --> 00:41:00,948
Harvey, stop.

980
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,668
I came to you
and asked for mercy.

981
00:41:03,753 --> 00:41:05,670
Do you know how hard
that was for me?

982
00:41:05,755 --> 00:41:08,089
And then for me to turn around
and use that to dupe you--

983
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:10,091
how could you think
I would do that?

984
00:41:10,142 --> 00:41:11,343
Well, what would you
have thought?

985
00:41:11,427 --> 00:41:13,178
I don't know,
but you could have called me.

986
00:41:13,262 --> 00:41:14,962
- And say what?
- And asked me

987
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:16,598
to exclude the firing
from the calculations.

988
00:41:16,649 --> 00:41:17,632
I'm not gonna do--

989
00:41:17,683 --> 00:41:19,133
What?
You're not gonna do what?

990
00:41:19,185 --> 00:41:20,825
Not gonna give me
the benefit of the doubt

991
00:41:20,853 --> 00:41:23,571
and be vulnerable--
expose yourself?

992
00:41:23,639 --> 00:41:25,807
I already did that
when I trusted you.

993
00:41:25,858 --> 00:41:29,361
That was mercy, which is
from a position of strength.

994
00:41:29,445 --> 00:41:32,497
Being vulnerable is
from a position of weakness.

995
00:41:32,581 --> 00:41:34,499
Well,
I'm not gonna do that.

996
00:41:38,037 --> 00:41:40,005
Well, then I guess
I'm not going to either.

997
00:41:40,089 --> 00:41:41,823
Meaning what?

998
00:41:41,874 --> 00:41:44,843
Meaning that I am not going
to dissolve this merger.

999
00:41:44,927 --> 00:41:46,511
You already signed
the agreement.

1000
00:41:46,595 --> 00:41:48,179
Then sue me.

1001
00:41:48,264 --> 00:41:50,331
You're gonna totally
shaft me anyway.

1002
00:41:50,383 --> 00:41:51,499
What's my downside?

1003
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:53,885
In the meantime,
you'll have a name partner

1004
00:41:53,969 --> 00:41:56,170
who can't practice in America,
whose reputation is shit,

1005
00:41:56,222 --> 00:41:58,302
and who's gonna tie up
all your profits in litigation

1006
00:41:58,307 --> 00:41:59,524
for the next five years.

1007
00:41:59,608 --> 00:42:01,476
You're willing
to do all that

1008
00:42:01,527 --> 00:42:03,695
and expect me to believe
you weren't behind

1009
00:42:03,779 --> 00:42:05,530
us getting fired
in the first place.

1010
00:42:05,614 --> 00:42:07,014
She's telling the truth,
Harvey.

1011
00:42:07,066 --> 00:42:08,546
- What?
- Scottie didn't get us fired.

1012
00:42:08,617 --> 00:42:10,351
Ava Hessington did.
That doesn't mean anything.

1013
00:42:10,403 --> 00:42:11,853
Scottie
could have arranged it.

1014
00:42:11,904 --> 00:42:13,321
Well, she didn't,

1015
00:42:13,372 --> 00:42:14,906
because Ava
didn't just fire us.

1016
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:17,692
She's suing all of us...

1017
00:42:17,743 --> 00:42:19,694
for malpractice.
