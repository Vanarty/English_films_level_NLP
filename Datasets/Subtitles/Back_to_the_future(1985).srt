00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:30,259
October is inventory time,

2
00:01:30,343 --> 00:01:31,969
so right now, Statler Toyota

3
00:01:32,053 --> 00:01:33,929
is making the best deals of the year

4
00:01:34,014 --> 00:01:36,182
on all 1985-model Toyotas.

5
00:01:36,349 --> 00:01:37,808
You won't find a better car

6
00:01:37,893 --> 00:01:41,187
at a better price with better<br/>service anywhere in Hill Valley.

7
00:01:41,521 --> 00:01:44,565
That's Statler Toyota<br/>in downtown Hill Valley.

8
00:01:47,652 --> 00:01:50,529
The Senate is<br/>expected to vote on this today.

9
00:01:50,614 --> 00:01:54,784
In other news, officials at the<br/>Pacific Nuclear research facility

10
00:01:54,868 --> 00:01:57,536
have denied the rumor that<br/>a case of missing plutonium

11
00:01:57,621 --> 00:02:00,873
was in fact stolen from<br/>their vault two weeks ago.

12
00:02:00,957 --> 00:02:03,417
A Libyan terrorist group<br/>had claimed responsibility

13
00:02:03,502 --> 00:02:04,710
for the alleged theft.

14
00:02:04,795 --> 00:02:06,879
However, officials now attribute

15
00:02:06,963 --> 00:02:09,381
the discrepancy to a<br/>simple clerical error.

16
00:02:09,883 --> 00:02:13,636
The FBI, which is investigating<br/>the matter, had no comment.

17
00:02:55,428 --> 00:02:56,720
Hey, Doc?

18
00:02:59,307 --> 00:03:00,432
Doc?

19
00:03:01,601 --> 00:03:03,352
Hello! Anybody home?

20
00:03:03,728 --> 00:03:04,687
Einstein, come here, boy.

21
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:08,357
What's going on? Oh, God.

22
00:03:09,192 --> 00:03:11,151
Oh, Jesus!

23
00:03:11,778 --> 00:03:15,030
That is disgusting.<br/>Where the hell is he?

24
00:04:35,111 --> 00:04:36,278
Whoa!

25
00:04:39,157 --> 00:04:40,658
Rock 'n' roll.

26
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:50,417
Yo. DOC: Marty, is that you?

27
00:04:50,502 --> 00:04:52,544
Hey. Hey, Doc. Where are you?

28
00:04:52,629 --> 00:04:53,796
Thank God I've found you.

29
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,298
Listen, can you meet me at<br/>Twin Pines Mall tonight at 1:15?

30
00:04:56,383 --> 00:04:58,133
I made a major breakthrough,<br/>and I'll need your assistance.

31
00:04:58,218 --> 00:04:59,426
Wait a minute. 1:15 in the morning?

32
00:04:59,511 --> 00:05:00,511
Yeah.

33
00:05:00,595 --> 00:05:02,262
Doc, what's going on?

34
00:05:02,347 --> 00:05:04,306
Where you been all week? Working.

35
00:05:04,391 --> 00:05:05,766
Where's Einstein? Is he with you?

36
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:07,559
Yeah, he's right here.

37
00:05:07,644 --> 00:05:10,270
You know, Doc, you left<br/>your equipment on all week.

38
00:05:10,355 --> 00:05:12,940
My equipment. That reminds me, Marty.

39
00:05:13,024 --> 00:05:14,483
You better not hook up to the amplifier.

40
00:05:14,567 --> 00:05:16,860
There's a slight<br/>possibility of overload.

41
00:05:16,945 --> 00:05:19,321
Yeah. I'll keep that in mind.

42
00:05:19,406 --> 00:05:21,824
Good. I'll see you<br/>tonight. Don't forget now.

43
00:05:21,908 --> 00:05:23,701
1:15 a.m., Twin Pines Mall.

44
00:05:23,785 --> 00:05:24,827
Right.

45
00:05:31,584 --> 00:05:33,335
Are those my clocks I hear?

46
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:36,088
Yeah, it's 8:00.

47
00:05:36,506 --> 00:05:38,674
Perfect! My experiment worked!

48
00:05:38,758 --> 00:05:41,260
They're all exactly 25 minutes slow!

49
00:05:42,262 --> 00:05:44,263
Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Doc.

50
00:05:44,848 --> 00:05:47,016
Are you telling me that it's 8:25?

51
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,225
Precisely.

52
00:05:48,768 --> 00:05:51,687
Damn! I'm late for school.

53
00:06:51,748 --> 00:06:53,499
Jennifer. Marty, don't go this way.

54
00:06:53,583 --> 00:06:54,583
Strickland's looking for you.

55
00:06:54,667 --> 00:06:57,002
If you get caught, it'll<br/>be four tardies in a row.

56
00:06:59,005 --> 00:07:01,298
All right, come on. I think we're safe.

57
00:07:01,382 --> 00:07:03,509
You know, this time it wasn't my fault.

58
00:07:03,593 --> 00:07:05,928
The doc set all his<br/>clocks 25 minutes slow.

59
00:07:06,012 --> 00:07:07,262
Doc?

60
00:07:07,347 --> 00:07:10,724
Am I to understand you're still hanging<br/>around with Dr. Emmett Brown, McFly?

61
00:07:12,227 --> 00:07:14,311
Tardy slip for you, Miss Parker.

62
00:07:15,063 --> 00:07:18,690
And one for you, McFly. I<br/>believe that makes four in a row.

63
00:07:18,775 --> 00:07:21,735
Let me give you a nickel's<br/>worth of free advice, young man.

64
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:24,988
This so-called Dr. Brown is<br/>dangerous. He's a real nutcase.

65
00:07:25,073 --> 00:07:27,491
You hang around with him, you're<br/>gonna end up in big trouble.

66
00:07:27,575 --> 00:07:28,867
Ooh. Yes, sir.

67
00:07:29,577 --> 00:07:33,163
You got a real attitude<br/>problem, McFly. You're a slacker.

68
00:07:33,414 --> 00:07:35,082
You remind me of your<br/>father when he went here.

69
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:37,543
He was a slacker, too.

70
00:07:37,627 --> 00:07:39,711
Can I go now, Mr. Strickland?

71
00:07:39,796 --> 00:07:41,463
I noticed your band is on the roster

72
00:07:41,548 --> 00:07:43,549
for the dance auditions<br/>after school today.

73
00:07:43,633 --> 00:07:46,051
Why even bother, McFly?<br/>You don't have a chance.

74
00:07:46,136 --> 00:07:47,928
You're too much like your old man.

75
00:07:48,012 --> 00:07:50,264
No McFly ever amounted to anything

76
00:07:50,348 --> 00:07:52,057
in the history of Hill Valley.

77
00:07:54,018 --> 00:07:56,186
Yeah, well, history is gonna change.

78
00:07:58,314 --> 00:07:59,773
Next, please.

79
00:08:05,071 --> 00:08:06,738
Okay, guys, let's rock 'n roll.

80
00:08:09,033 --> 00:08:10,367
All right.

81
00:08:11,202 --> 00:08:13,912
We're the... We're the Pinheads.

82
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:17,040
One, two, three.

83
00:08:36,644 --> 00:08:39,730
Okay, that's enough. Thank you, fellas.

84
00:08:40,481 --> 00:08:41,940
Hold it, fellas.

85
00:08:42,358 --> 00:08:44,693
I'm afraid you're just too darn loud.

86
00:08:45,445 --> 00:08:46,987
Next, please.

87
00:08:49,157 --> 00:08:51,491
Bring up the next group, please.

88
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:56,371
Re-elect<br/>Mayor "Goldie" Wilson.

89
00:08:56,456 --> 00:08:58,457
Progress is his middle name.

90
00:08:58,541 --> 00:09:00,626
"Too loud." I can't believe it.

91
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:03,337
I'm never gonna get a chance<br/>to play in front of anybody.

92
00:09:03,421 --> 00:09:05,797
Marty, one rejection<br/>isn't the end of the world.

93
00:09:05,882 --> 00:09:08,300
I just don't think<br/>I'm cut out for music.

94
00:09:08,384 --> 00:09:10,344
But you're good, Marty.<br/>You're really good,

95
00:09:10,428 --> 00:09:12,221
and this audition<br/>tape of yours is great.

96
00:09:12,305 --> 00:09:14,348
You've gotta send it in<br/>to the record company.

97
00:09:14,474 --> 00:09:16,225
It's like Doc's always<br/>saying. Yeah, I know. I know.

98
00:09:16,309 --> 00:09:17,351
"If you put your mind to it,

99
00:09:17,435 --> 00:09:19,937
"you can accomplish anything."

100
00:09:20,021 --> 00:09:22,022
That's good advice, Marty.

101
00:09:22,106 --> 00:09:23,565
All right, okay, Jennifer.

102
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:25,609
What if I send in the tape<br/>and they don't like it?

103
00:09:25,693 --> 00:09:27,611
What if they say I'm no good?

104
00:09:27,695 --> 00:09:29,988
What if they say, "Get out of<br/>here, kid. You got no future"?

105
00:09:30,073 --> 00:09:33,283
I mean, I just don't think I<br/>can take that kind of rejection.

106
00:09:33,368 --> 00:09:35,369
Jesus, I'm starting to<br/>sound like my old man.

107
00:09:35,453 --> 00:09:37,204
Come on. He's not that<br/>bad. Save the clock tower.

108
00:09:37,288 --> 00:09:40,832
At least he's letting you<br/>borrow the car tomorrow night.

109
00:09:41,501 --> 00:09:43,418
Check out that 4x4.

110
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,420
That is hot.

111
00:09:45,505 --> 00:09:46,755
Okay. Back her up.

112
00:09:46,839 --> 00:09:50,092
Someday, Jennifer. Someday.

113
00:09:50,551 --> 00:09:54,054
Wouldn't it be great to take<br/>that truck up to the lake?

114
00:09:55,056 --> 00:09:58,058
Throw a couple of<br/>sleeping bags in the back.

115
00:09:59,394 --> 00:10:01,353
Lie out underneath the stars.

116
00:10:01,437 --> 00:10:03,272
Stop it. What?

117
00:10:04,107 --> 00:10:06,733
Does your mom know?<br/>About tomorrow night?

118
00:10:06,818 --> 00:10:08,026
No, get out of town.

119
00:10:08,111 --> 00:10:10,862
My mom thinks I'm going<br/>camping with the guys.

120
00:10:10,947 --> 00:10:12,531
Jennifer, my mother would freak out

121
00:10:12,615 --> 00:10:13,949
if she knew I was<br/>going up there with you,

122
00:10:14,033 --> 00:10:16,201
and I'd get the standard lecture about

123
00:10:16,286 --> 00:10:18,662
how she never did that kind<br/>of stuff when she was a kid.

124
00:10:18,746 --> 00:10:21,623
I mean, look, I think<br/>the woman was born a nun.

125
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:24,209
She's just trying to<br/>keep you respectable.

126
00:10:24,294 --> 00:10:26,461
Well, she's not doing a very good job.

127
00:10:26,546 --> 00:10:27,754
Terrible.

128
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:31,508
Save the clock tower.<br/>Save the clock tower.

129
00:10:31,592 --> 00:10:35,637
Mayor Wilson is sponsoring an<br/>initiative to replace that clock.

130
00:10:35,722 --> 00:10:38,307
Thirty years ago, lightning<br/>struck that clock tower

131
00:10:38,391 --> 00:10:40,142
and the clock hasn't run since.

132
00:10:40,226 --> 00:10:42,519
We at the Hill Valley<br/>Preservation Society

133
00:10:42,603 --> 00:10:45,022
think it should be preserved<br/>exactly the way it is

134
00:10:45,106 --> 00:10:46,857
as part of our history and heritage.

135
00:10:46,941 --> 00:10:47,983
There you go, lady. There's a quarter.

136
00:10:48,067 --> 00:10:49,109
Thank you.

137
00:10:49,193 --> 00:10:50,235
Don't forget to take a flyer.

138
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,320
Right.

139
00:10:51,404 --> 00:10:53,322
Save the clock tower!

140
00:10:54,991 --> 00:10:56,575
Where were we?

141
00:10:57,076 --> 00:10:58,160
Right about here.

142
00:10:58,244 --> 00:10:59,328
Jennifer!

143
00:11:02,415 --> 00:11:04,791
It's my dad. I've got to go. Right.

144
00:11:04,876 --> 00:11:06,335
I'll call you tonight.

145
00:11:06,419 --> 00:11:07,544
I'll be at my grandma's.

146
00:11:07,628 --> 00:11:10,047
Here, let me give you the number.

147
00:11:15,053 --> 00:11:16,094
Bye.

148
00:11:59,305 --> 00:12:02,307
Bravo,<br/>Tango, Delta 6-2-9.

149
00:12:02,392 --> 00:12:05,477
Tow for impoundment.<br/>Any unit, please respond.

150
00:12:07,897 --> 00:12:10,482
Perfect. Just perfect.

151
00:12:16,948 --> 00:12:19,116
I can't believe you'd loan me your car

152
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,034
without telling me it had a blind spot.

153
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:22,702
Blind spot? I could've been killed.

154
00:12:23,079 --> 00:12:25,414
Now, Biff, now, I never noticed

155
00:12:25,498 --> 00:12:29,501
that the car had any blind spot<br/>before when I would drive it.

156
00:12:29,585 --> 00:12:31,002
Hi, Son.

157
00:12:31,087 --> 00:12:33,296
What, are you<br/>blind, McFly? It's there.

158
00:12:33,381 --> 00:12:35,257
How else do you explain<br/>that wreck out there?

159
00:12:35,341 --> 00:12:38,343
Biff, can I assume

160
00:12:38,761 --> 00:12:41,805
that your insurance is<br/>going to pay for the damage?

161
00:12:41,889 --> 00:12:44,182
My insurance? It's your car.

162
00:12:44,267 --> 00:12:45,475
Your insurance should pay for it.

163
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,102
I wanna know who's<br/>going to pay for this?

164
00:12:47,186 --> 00:12:49,062
I spilled beer all over it<br/>when the car smashed into me.

165
00:12:49,147 --> 00:12:50,230
Who's gonna pay my cleaning bill?

166
00:12:50,314 --> 00:12:51,314
Ah...

167
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:53,358
And where's my reports?

168
00:12:53,443 --> 00:12:54,943
Well, I haven't finished those up yet,

169
00:12:55,027 --> 00:12:57,696
but I figured since<br/>they weren't due till...

170
00:12:57,780 --> 00:13:00,699
Hello? Hello? Anybody home? Huh?

171
00:13:01,409 --> 00:13:03,702
Think, McFly. Think! All right.

172
00:13:03,786 --> 00:13:05,871
I got to have time to get them retyped.

173
00:13:05,955 --> 00:13:07,205
Do you realize what would happen

174
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:10,083
if I hand in my reports<br/>in your handwriting?

175
00:13:10,168 --> 00:13:11,710
I'll get fired.

176
00:13:11,794 --> 00:13:14,588
You wouldn't want that<br/>to happen, would you?

177
00:13:14,672 --> 00:13:16,590
Would you? Of course not, Biff.

178
00:13:16,674 --> 00:13:19,134
Now, I wouldn't want that to happen.

179
00:13:19,218 --> 00:13:22,053
Now, look. I'll finish<br/>those reports on up tonight,

180
00:13:22,138 --> 00:13:24,973
and I'll run them on over<br/>first thing tomorrow, all right?

181
00:13:25,057 --> 00:13:26,892
Not too early. I sleep in Saturday.

182
00:13:26,976 --> 00:13:28,226
McFly, your shoe's untied.

183
00:13:28,311 --> 00:13:29,311
Oh.

184
00:13:29,395 --> 00:13:31,771
Don't be so gullible, McFly.

185
00:13:31,856 --> 00:13:33,732
Got the place fixed<br/>up nice, though, McFly.

186
00:13:36,027 --> 00:13:38,069
I have your car towed<br/>all the way to your house

187
00:13:38,154 --> 00:13:39,821
and all you got for me is lite beer?

188
00:13:47,788 --> 00:13:50,248
What are you looking at, butthead?

189
00:13:52,251 --> 00:13:54,294
Say hi to your mom for me.

190
00:13:57,089 --> 00:13:59,090
I know what you're going to say, Son,

191
00:13:59,175 --> 00:14:01,801
and you're right. You're right.

192
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:06,890
But Biff just happens<br/>to be my supervisor,

193
00:14:08,184 --> 00:14:11,603
And I'm afraid I'm just not<br/>very good at confrontations.

194
00:14:12,688 --> 00:14:14,481
But the car, Dad.

195
00:14:16,275 --> 00:14:18,944
I mean, he wrecked it. He totaled it.

196
00:14:19,862 --> 00:14:21,947
I needed that car tomorrow night, Dad.

197
00:14:22,031 --> 00:14:24,199
Do you have any idea how<br/>important this was to me?

198
00:14:24,283 --> 00:14:25,325
Do you have any clue?

199
00:14:25,409 --> 00:14:28,078
I know, and all I can say is, I'm...

200
00:14:28,621 --> 00:14:30,080
I'm sorry.

201
00:14:30,373 --> 00:14:32,749
Believe me, Marty, you're better off

202
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:35,752
without having to worry<br/>about all the aggravation

203
00:14:35,836 --> 00:14:39,089
and headaches of playing at that dance.

204
00:14:39,173 --> 00:14:40,840
He's absolutely right, Marty.

205
00:14:40,925 --> 00:14:43,426
The last thing you need is headaches.

206
00:14:51,269 --> 00:14:54,896
Kids, we're going to have to<br/>eat this cake by ourselves.

207
00:14:55,481 --> 00:14:57,857
Your Uncle Joey didn't<br/>make parole again.

208
00:15:00,236 --> 00:15:03,572
I think it would be nice if<br/>you all dropped him a line.

209
00:15:03,656 --> 00:15:05,407
Uncle "Jailbird" Joey?

210
00:15:05,491 --> 00:15:06,950
He's your brother, Mom.

211
00:15:07,034 --> 00:15:10,870
Yeah. I think it's a major<br/>embarrassment, having an uncle in prison.

212
00:15:11,289 --> 00:15:13,164
We all make mistakes in life, children.

213
00:15:13,249 --> 00:15:14,958
God damn it. I'm late.

214
00:15:15,042 --> 00:15:16,710
David, watch your mouth!

215
00:15:16,794 --> 00:15:19,379
You come here and kiss your<br/>mother before you go. Come here.

216
00:15:19,463 --> 00:15:22,549
Come on, Mom. Make it<br/>fast. I'll miss my bus.

217
00:15:23,009 --> 00:15:24,509
See you later, Pop.

218
00:15:24,594 --> 00:15:27,345
Time to change that oil.

219
00:15:30,474 --> 00:15:34,019
Hey, Marty. I'm not<br/>your answering service.

220
00:15:34,103 --> 00:15:36,521
While you were outside<br/>pouting over the car,

221
00:15:36,606 --> 00:15:38,857
Jennifer Parker called you twice.

222
00:15:38,941 --> 00:15:40,358
I don't like her, Marty.

223
00:15:40,443 --> 00:15:43,570
Any girl who calls up a boy<br/>is just asking for trouble.

224
00:15:43,654 --> 00:15:46,531
Oh, Mother, there's nothing<br/>wrong with calling a boy.

225
00:15:46,616 --> 00:15:50,118
I think it's terrible.<br/>Girls chasing boys.

226
00:15:50,536 --> 00:15:53,872
When I was your age, I never<br/>chased a boy or called a boy

227
00:15:53,956 --> 00:15:56,499
or sat in a parked car with a boy.

228
00:15:57,168 --> 00:16:00,045
Then how am I supposed<br/>to ever meet anybody?

229
00:16:00,713 --> 00:16:03,173
Well, it'll just happen.

230
00:16:03,257 --> 00:16:04,758
Like the way I met your father.

231
00:16:05,635 --> 00:16:08,553
That was so stupid. Grandpa<br/>hit him with the car.

232
00:16:09,055 --> 00:16:10,805
It was meant to be.

233
00:16:11,682 --> 00:16:15,185
Anyway, if Grandpa hadn't hit him,

234
00:16:15,269 --> 00:16:16,936
then none of you would have been born.

235
00:16:17,021 --> 00:16:18,313
Yeah, well.

236
00:16:18,898 --> 00:16:20,649
I still don't understand<br/>what Dad was doing

237
00:16:20,733 --> 00:16:22,150
in the middle of the street.

238
00:16:22,234 --> 00:16:24,694
What was it, George? Bird-watching?

239
00:16:24,779 --> 00:16:26,905
What, Lorraine? What?

240
00:16:27,406 --> 00:16:30,325
Anyway, your Grandpa<br/>hit him with the car

241
00:16:30,409 --> 00:16:32,118
and brought him into the house.

242
00:16:33,496 --> 00:16:35,413
He seemed so helpless,

243
00:16:38,167 --> 00:16:41,169
like a little lost puppy, and<br/>my heart just went out to him.

244
00:16:41,253 --> 00:16:44,422
Yeah, Mom, we know. You've<br/>told us this story a million times.

245
00:16:44,507 --> 00:16:45,840
You felt sorry for him,

246
00:16:45,925 --> 00:16:47,384
so you decided to go with him

247
00:16:47,468 --> 00:16:49,010
to the Fish Under the Sea dance.

248
00:16:49,095 --> 00:16:52,263
No. It was the Enchantment<br/>Under the Sea dance.

249
00:16:53,099 --> 00:16:56,226
Our first date. I'll never forget it.

250
00:16:56,686 --> 00:16:59,354
It was the night of that terrible<br/>thunderstorm, remember, George?

251
00:17:03,025 --> 00:17:06,945
Your father kissed me for the very<br/>first time on that dance floor.

252
00:17:08,864 --> 00:17:11,032
It was then that I realized

253
00:17:11,117 --> 00:17:13,993
that I was going to spend<br/>the rest of my life with him.

254
00:17:43,023 --> 00:17:44,065
Hello.

255
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:45,608
Marty, you didn't<br/>fall asleep, did you?

256
00:17:45,693 --> 00:17:47,152
Doc.

257
00:17:48,195 --> 00:17:50,613
No. No, don't be silly.

258
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:53,950
Listen, this is very important.<br/>I forgot my video camera.

259
00:17:54,034 --> 00:17:56,870
Can you stop by my place and pick<br/>it up on your way to the mall?

260
00:17:56,954 --> 00:17:59,706
Yeah. I'm on my way.

261
00:18:23,898 --> 00:18:26,107
Einstein! Hey, Einstein,<br/>where's the doc, boy? Huh?

262
00:19:20,247 --> 00:19:21,372
Doc!

263
00:19:22,666 --> 00:19:23,999
Marty! You made it!

264
00:19:24,084 --> 00:19:25,125
Yeah.

265
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:27,294
Welcome to my latest<br/>experiment. This is the big one,

266
00:19:27,379 --> 00:19:29,255
the one I've been<br/>waiting for all my life.

267
00:19:29,339 --> 00:19:30,798
Well, it's a DeLorean...

268
00:19:30,882 --> 00:19:32,716
Bear with me, Marty. All your<br/>questions will be answered.

269
00:19:32,801 --> 00:19:34,134
Roll tape and we'll proceed.

270
00:19:34,219 --> 00:19:35,261
Doc,

271
00:19:35,345 --> 00:19:36,345
is that a DEVO suit?

272
00:19:36,429 --> 00:19:37,721
Never mind that now.

273
00:19:37,806 --> 00:19:38,889
Not now.

274
00:19:38,974 --> 00:19:40,015
All right. I'm ready.

275
00:19:40,642 --> 00:19:42,351
Good evening. I'm Dr. Emmett Brown.

276
00:19:42,435 --> 00:19:44,603
I'm standing on the parking<br/>lot at Twin Pines Mall.

277
00:19:44,688 --> 00:19:48,274
It's Saturday morning,<br/>October 26, 1985, 1:18 a.m.,

278
00:19:48,358 --> 00:19:50,609
and this is temporal<br/>experiment number one.

279
00:19:50,694 --> 00:19:52,736
Come on, Einie. Hey,<br/>hey, boy, get in there.

280
00:19:52,821 --> 00:19:55,114
That a boy! In you go. Sit down.

281
00:19:56,074 --> 00:19:57,575
Put your seat belt on. That's it.

282
00:20:02,706 --> 00:20:03,747
Whoa, whoa. Whoa.

283
00:20:03,832 --> 00:20:05,207
Okay.

284
00:20:06,543 --> 00:20:09,169
Please note that Einstein's clock

285
00:20:09,254 --> 00:20:12,172
is in precise synchronization<br/>with my control watch.

286
00:20:12,299 --> 00:20:13,841
Got it? Right. Check, Doc.

287
00:20:13,925 --> 00:20:14,925
Good.

288
00:20:17,095 --> 00:20:20,055
Have a good trip,<br/>Einstein. Watch your head.

289
00:20:25,729 --> 00:20:27,062
You got that thing hooked up to the car?

290
00:20:28,315 --> 00:20:29,315
Watch this.

291
00:20:29,399 --> 00:20:31,692
Yeah. Okay. Got it.

292
00:20:35,822 --> 00:20:36,989
Jesus!

293
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:43,537
Not me! The car! The car!

294
00:21:00,889 --> 00:21:03,182
If my calculations are correct,

295
00:21:03,725 --> 00:21:06,352
when this baby hits 88 miles per hour

296
00:21:06,811 --> 00:21:08,854
you're going to see some serious shit.

297
00:21:44,849 --> 00:21:46,558
Watch this. Watch this.

298
00:22:04,661 --> 00:22:06,996
What did I tell you?

299
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:10,541
88 miles per hour!

300
00:22:13,628 --> 00:22:15,129
The temporal displacement occurred

301
00:22:15,213 --> 00:22:18,549
exactly 1:20 a.m. And zero seconds!

302
00:22:20,301 --> 00:22:22,177
Jesus Christ!

303
00:22:22,262 --> 00:22:24,680
Jesus Christ, Doc! You<br/>disintegrated Einstein!

304
00:22:24,764 --> 00:22:27,391
Calm down, Marty. I didn't<br/>disintegrate anything.

305
00:22:27,475 --> 00:22:32,187
The molecular structure of both Einstein<br/>and the car are completely intact.

306
00:22:32,272 --> 00:22:33,647
Then where the hell are they?

307
00:22:33,732 --> 00:22:35,232
The appropriate question is,

308
00:22:35,316 --> 00:22:36,859
"When the hell are they?"

309
00:22:36,943 --> 00:22:41,405
You see, Einstein has just become<br/>the world's first time traveler.

310
00:22:41,906 --> 00:22:44,825
I sent him into the future.

311
00:22:45,577 --> 00:22:47,953
One minute into the future, to be exact.

312
00:22:48,038 --> 00:22:51,248
At precisely 1:21 a.m. And zero seconds,

313
00:22:51,332 --> 00:22:54,209
we shall catch up with<br/>him and the time machine.

314
00:22:57,756 --> 00:22:59,757
Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Doc.

315
00:23:01,426 --> 00:23:04,303
Are you telling me that<br/>you built a time machine

316
00:23:05,513 --> 00:23:06,638
out of a DeLorean?

317
00:23:06,723 --> 00:23:07,765
The way I see it,

318
00:23:07,849 --> 00:23:09,725
if you're going to build<br/>a time machine into a car,

319
00:23:09,809 --> 00:23:11,643
why not do it with some style?

320
00:23:11,728 --> 00:23:14,897
Besides, the stainless-steel<br/>construction made the flux dispersal...

321
00:23:16,524 --> 00:23:17,941
Look out!

322
00:24:02,821 --> 00:24:03,946
What? Is it hot?

323
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:05,739
It's cold. Damn cold.

324
00:24:09,452 --> 00:24:11,370
Einstein, you little devil!

325
00:24:13,873 --> 00:24:15,666
Einstein's clock is exactly one minute

326
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:18,127
behind mine and still ticking!

327
00:24:21,631 --> 00:24:22,840
He's all right. He's fine.

328
00:24:22,924 --> 00:24:25,259
And he's completely unaware<br/>that anything happened.

329
00:24:25,343 --> 00:24:27,970
As far as he's concerned,<br/>the trip was instantaneous.

330
00:24:28,054 --> 00:24:30,639
That's why his watch is<br/>exactly one minute behind mine.

331
00:24:30,723 --> 00:24:31,807
He skipped over that minute

332
00:24:31,891 --> 00:24:33,767
to instantly arrive<br/>at this moment in time.

333
00:24:33,852 --> 00:24:35,686
Come here. I'll show you how it works.

334
00:24:35,770 --> 00:24:36,895
All right.

335
00:24:38,565 --> 00:24:41,316
First, you turn the time circuits on.

336
00:24:45,363 --> 00:24:46,697
This readout tells<br/>you where you're going.

337
00:24:46,781 --> 00:24:47,990
This one tells you where you are.

338
00:24:48,074 --> 00:24:49,575
This one tells you where you were.

339
00:24:49,659 --> 00:24:51,994
You input your destination<br/>time on this keypad.

340
00:24:52,078 --> 00:24:53,328
Say you want to see the signing

341
00:24:53,413 --> 00:24:55,956
of the Declaration of Independence.

342
00:24:57,750 --> 00:25:00,043
Or witness the birth of Christ.

343
00:25:02,839 --> 00:25:05,465
Here's a red-letter date<br/>in the history of science.

344
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:08,260
November 5th, 1955.

345
00:25:12,098 --> 00:25:16,351
Yes, of course. November 5th, 1955.

346
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:18,937
What? I don't get it. What happened?

347
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:23,984
That was the day I invented time<br/>travel. I remember it vividly.

348
00:25:24,611 --> 00:25:26,653
I was standing on the edge<br/>of my toilet, hanging a clock.

349
00:25:26,738 --> 00:25:27,863
The porcelain was wet. I slipped,

350
00:25:27,947 --> 00:25:29,489
hit my head on the edge of the sink,

351
00:25:29,574 --> 00:25:31,617
and when I came to, I had a revelation,

352
00:25:31,701 --> 00:25:35,037
a vision, a picture in my<br/>head, a picture of this.

353
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:40,459
This is what makes time travel<br/>possible. The flux capacitor.

354
00:25:41,127 --> 00:25:42,336
Flux capacitor?

355
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:44,880
It's taken me almost 30 years<br/>and my entire family fortune

356
00:25:44,964 --> 00:25:47,382
to realize the vision of that day.

357
00:25:47,467 --> 00:25:49,718
My God, has it been that long?

358
00:25:50,386 --> 00:25:53,222
Things have certainly<br/>changed around here.

359
00:25:54,182 --> 00:25:56,058
I remember when this was all farmland

360
00:25:56,142 --> 00:25:58,268
as far as the eye could see.

361
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,980
Old man Peabody owned all of this.

362
00:26:03,233 --> 00:26:06,818
He had this crazy idea<br/>about breeding pine trees.

363
00:26:10,949 --> 00:26:14,409
This is heavy-duty, Doc. This is great.

364
00:26:14,869 --> 00:26:17,412
Does it run on regular<br/>unleaded gasoline?

365
00:26:17,497 --> 00:26:19,081
Unfortunately, no. It requires something

366
00:26:19,165 --> 00:26:21,291
with a little more kick. Plutonium.

367
00:26:21,751 --> 00:26:23,627
Plutonium. Wait a minute.

368
00:26:23,711 --> 00:26:26,088
Are you telling me that<br/>this sucker is nuclear?

369
00:26:26,172 --> 00:26:28,173
Hey, hey, hey! Keep<br/>rolling. Keep rolling there.

370
00:26:28,258 --> 00:26:30,092
No, no, no, this sucker's electrical,

371
00:26:30,176 --> 00:26:31,385
but I need a nuclear reaction

372
00:26:31,469 --> 00:26:33,929
to generate the 1.21 gigawatts<br/>of electricity I need.

373
00:26:34,013 --> 00:26:37,599
Doc, you don't just walk into<br/>a store and buy plutonium.

374
00:26:38,184 --> 00:26:39,851
Did you rip that off?

375
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:44,606
Of course. From a group<br/>of Libyan nationalists.

376
00:26:44,691 --> 00:26:45,899
They wanted me to build them a bomb,

377
00:26:45,984 --> 00:26:48,443
so I took their plutonium and, in<br/>turn, gave them a shoddy bomb casing

378
00:26:48,528 --> 00:26:50,237
full of used pinball machine parts.

379
00:26:50,363 --> 00:26:52,281
Come on. Let's get you<br/>a radiation suit. Jesus!

380
00:26:52,365 --> 00:26:53,740
We must prepare to reload.

381
00:27:22,895 --> 00:27:25,355
It's safe now. Everything's lead-lined.

382
00:27:27,275 --> 00:27:29,401
Don't you lose those tapes now.

383
00:27:29,485 --> 00:27:30,902
I need that as a record.

384
00:27:31,487 --> 00:27:33,864
Let's put this back here. There we go.

385
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,993
I almost forgot my luggage.

386
00:27:37,077 --> 00:27:39,829
Who knows if they've got<br/>cotton underwear in the future?

387
00:27:39,913 --> 00:27:41,205
I'm allergic to all synthetics.

388
00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:42,915
The future?

389
00:27:43,709 --> 00:27:44,709
That's where you're going?

390
00:27:44,793 --> 00:27:46,336
That's right, 25 years into the future.

391
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:49,464
I've always dreamed of seeing the<br/>future, looking beyond my years,

392
00:27:49,548 --> 00:27:51,674
seeing the progress of mankind.

393
00:27:51,759 --> 00:27:52,967
Why not?

394
00:27:53,052 --> 00:27:56,846
I'll also be able to see who<br/>wins the next 25 World Series.

395
00:27:57,222 --> 00:27:58,348
Doc.

396
00:27:58,432 --> 00:27:59,474
Huh?

397
00:27:59,641 --> 00:28:02,060
Look me up when you get there.

398
00:28:02,770 --> 00:28:05,313
Indeed, I will. Roll 'em.

399
00:28:11,653 --> 00:28:14,113
I, Dr. Emmett Brown,

400
00:28:15,699 --> 00:28:18,576
am about to embark on<br/>an historic journey.

401
00:28:20,496 --> 00:28:22,038
What am I thinking of?

402
00:28:22,122 --> 00:28:24,624
I almost forgot to<br/>bring extra plutonium.

403
00:28:24,708 --> 00:28:27,251
How did I ever expect to get<br/>back? One pellet, one trip.

404
00:28:27,336 --> 00:28:28,961
I must be out of my mind.

405
00:28:31,924 --> 00:28:33,591
What is it, Einie?

406
00:28:42,059 --> 00:28:43,601
Oh, my God.

407
00:28:43,685 --> 00:28:46,479
They found me. I don't<br/>know how, but they found me.

408
00:28:46,563 --> 00:28:47,647
Run for it, Marty!

409
00:28:47,731 --> 00:28:48,773
Who? Who?

410
00:28:49,233 --> 00:28:51,651
Who do you think? The Libyans!

411
00:28:54,947 --> 00:28:56,447
Holy shit!

412
00:29:00,494 --> 00:29:02,328
I'll draw their fire!

413
00:29:10,295 --> 00:29:11,337
Doc, wait!

414
00:29:25,936 --> 00:29:27,019
No!

415
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:29,814
You bastard!

416
00:29:48,667 --> 00:29:49,959
Go! Damn Soviet gun.

417
00:29:55,966 --> 00:29:57,008
Go!

418
00:30:37,883 --> 00:30:40,218
Come on! Move, damn it!

419
00:30:41,637 --> 00:30:42,970
Jesus!

420
00:31:03,116 --> 00:31:04,575
Holy shit!

421
00:31:05,327 --> 00:31:08,037
Let's see if you bastards can do 90.

422
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:02,216
What is it? What is it, Pa?

423
00:32:02,926 --> 00:32:06,220
Looks like an airplane without wings.

424
00:32:06,763 --> 00:32:09,599
That ain't no airplane. Look.

425
00:32:30,662 --> 00:32:31,912
Children!

426
00:32:31,997 --> 00:32:33,331
Listen... Whoa.

427
00:32:46,011 --> 00:32:47,219
Hello?

428
00:32:50,349 --> 00:32:51,724
Excuse me.

429
00:32:55,145 --> 00:32:56,395
Sorry about your barn.

430
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:03,444
It's already mutated<br/>into human form! Shoot it!

431
00:33:05,364 --> 00:33:07,698
Take that, you mutated son of a bitch!

432
00:33:11,912 --> 00:33:13,079
Get away!

433
00:33:14,331 --> 00:33:15,414
Hold it.

434
00:33:15,791 --> 00:33:17,375
Shoot it, Pa!

435
00:33:19,795 --> 00:33:22,838
My pine! Why you...

436
00:33:24,883 --> 00:33:28,302
You space bastard! You killed our pine!

437
00:33:32,683 --> 00:33:34,642
All right. All right. Okay, McFly.

438
00:33:34,726 --> 00:33:36,852
Get a grip on yourself.<br/>It's all a dream.

439
00:33:36,937 --> 00:33:39,730
It's just a very intense dream.

440
00:34:22,983 --> 00:34:24,233
Listen, you got to help me.

441
00:34:24,317 --> 00:34:26,610
Don't stop, Wilbur! Don't!

442
00:34:28,655 --> 00:34:29,655
It can't be.

443
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:37,079
This is nuts.

444
00:34:41,835 --> 00:34:43,127
Come on.

445
00:34:44,129 --> 00:34:45,421
Perfect.

446
00:36:40,829 --> 00:36:44,373
Remember, fellow<br/>citizens, the future is in your hands.

447
00:36:44,457 --> 00:36:48,252
If you believe in progress,<br/>re-elect Mayor Red Thomas.

448
00:36:48,336 --> 00:36:50,379
Progress is his middle name.

449
00:36:50,463 --> 00:36:53,048
Mayor Red Thomas' progress platform

450
00:36:53,133 --> 00:36:55,676
means more jobs, better education,

451
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:58,554
bigger civic improvements<br/>and lower taxes.

452
00:36:58,930 --> 00:37:02,641
On election day, cast your<br/>vote for a proven leader.

453
00:37:02,726 --> 00:37:05,060
Re-elect Mayor Red Thomas.

454
00:37:08,356 --> 00:37:10,524
This has got to be a dream.

455
00:37:27,375 --> 00:37:30,294
Hey, kid. What'd you do? Jump ship?

456
00:37:30,378 --> 00:37:31,378
What?

457
00:37:31,463 --> 00:37:33,130
What's with the life preserver?

458
00:37:38,094 --> 00:37:40,387
I just want to use the phone.

459
00:37:40,472 --> 00:37:41,680
Yeah, it's in the back.

460
00:37:44,601 --> 00:37:45,935
Brown.

461
00:37:48,313 --> 00:37:49,730
Great. You're alive.

462
00:38:01,701 --> 00:38:03,035
Come on.

463
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:12,336
Do you know where 1640 Riverside...

464
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:15,047
Are you going to order something, kid?

465
00:38:16,675 --> 00:38:19,009
Yeah. Give me a Tab.

466
00:38:19,886 --> 00:38:22,304
Tab? I can't give you a tab<br/>unless you order something.

467
00:38:22,389 --> 00:38:24,473
Right. Give me a Pepsi Free.

468
00:38:24,557 --> 00:38:27,309
You want a Pepsi, pal,<br/>you're going to pay for it.

469
00:38:27,394 --> 00:38:30,604
Just give me something<br/>without any sugar in it, okay?

470
00:38:30,689 --> 00:38:32,690
Something without sugar.

471
00:38:40,073 --> 00:38:41,532
Hey, McFly.

472
00:38:43,952 --> 00:38:46,245
What do you think you're doing?

473
00:38:46,538 --> 00:38:47,621
Biff.

474
00:38:47,872 --> 00:38:50,374
I'm talking to you,<br/>McFly, you Irish bug!

475
00:38:50,458 --> 00:38:52,626
Hey, Biff. Hey, guys. How are you doing?

476
00:38:52,711 --> 00:38:54,461
You got my homework finished, McFly?

477
00:38:55,088 --> 00:38:57,798
Well, actually, I figured since<br/>it wasn't due till Monday...

478
00:38:57,882 --> 00:38:59,675
Hello? Hello? Anybody home?

479
00:39:01,261 --> 00:39:03,137
Think, McFly. Think! Okay.

480
00:39:03,221 --> 00:39:05,097
I got to have time to recopy it.

481
00:39:05,181 --> 00:39:06,348
You realize what would happen

482
00:39:06,433 --> 00:39:08,934
if I hand in my homework<br/>in your handwriting?

483
00:39:09,019 --> 00:39:10,728
I'll get kicked out of school.

484
00:39:10,812 --> 00:39:13,272
You wouldn't want that<br/>to happen, would you?

485
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:16,191
Would you?

486
00:39:16,276 --> 00:39:17,317
Now, of course not, Biff.

487
00:39:17,402 --> 00:39:19,319
No. I wouldn't want that to happen.

488
00:39:19,404 --> 00:39:20,946
What are you looking at, butthead?

489
00:39:21,031 --> 00:39:23,365
Biff, get a load of this<br/>guy's life preserver.

490
00:39:23,450 --> 00:39:25,159
Dork thinks he's going to drown.

491
00:39:25,243 --> 00:39:27,536
How about my homework, McFly?

492
00:39:28,246 --> 00:39:31,540
Okay, Biff. Well, I'll<br/>finish that on up tonight

493
00:39:31,624 --> 00:39:34,918
and then I'll bring it over<br/>first thing tomorrow morning.

494
00:39:35,003 --> 00:39:36,545
Not too early. I sleep in Sundays.

495
00:39:36,629 --> 00:39:37,921
Oh, McFly, your shoe's untied!

496
00:39:39,132 --> 00:39:41,175
Don't be so gullible, McFly. Okay.

497
00:39:41,259 --> 00:39:42,342
I don't want to see you in here again.

498
00:39:42,427 --> 00:39:45,137
Okay. All right. Bye-bye.

499
00:40:06,951 --> 00:40:07,951
What?

500
00:40:08,036 --> 00:40:09,328
You're George McFly.

501
00:40:09,871 --> 00:40:11,246
Yeah. Who are you?

502
00:40:11,331 --> 00:40:12,956
Say! Why do you let those boys

503
00:40:13,041 --> 00:40:14,541
push you around like that for?

504
00:40:14,626 --> 00:40:15,918
Well, they're bigger than me.

505
00:40:16,002 --> 00:40:18,629
Stand tall, boy. Have<br/>some respect for yourself.

506
00:40:18,713 --> 00:40:20,923
Don't you know, if you let<br/>people walk over you now,

507
00:40:21,007 --> 00:40:23,092
they'll be walking over you<br/>for the rest of your life.

508
00:40:23,176 --> 00:40:24,593
Look at me. You think I'm gonna

509
00:40:24,677 --> 00:40:26,345
spend the rest of my<br/>life in this slop house?

510
00:40:26,429 --> 00:40:28,222
Watch it, Goldie. No, sir!

511
00:40:28,306 --> 00:40:29,515
I'm gonna make something of myself.

512
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:30,808
I'm going to night school,

513
00:40:30,892 --> 00:40:33,102
and one day, I'm going to be somebody.

514
00:40:33,186 --> 00:40:35,062
That's right. He's going to be mayor.

515
00:40:35,146 --> 00:40:36,522
Yeah, I'm...

516
00:40:37,190 --> 00:40:38,565
Mayor!

517
00:40:39,317 --> 00:40:43,237
Now that's a good idea!<br/>I could run for mayor.

518
00:40:43,321 --> 00:40:44,822
A colored mayor. That'll be the day.

519
00:40:44,906 --> 00:40:47,241
You wait and see, Mr.<br/>Caruthers. I will be mayor.

520
00:40:47,325 --> 00:40:49,618
I'll be the most powerful<br/>man in Hill Valley,

521
00:40:49,702 --> 00:40:51,495
and I'm going to clean up this town.

522
00:40:51,579 --> 00:40:54,540
Good. You can start<br/>by sweeping the floor.

523
00:40:57,085 --> 00:41:01,213
Mayor Goldie Wilson. I<br/>like the sound of that.

524
00:41:13,726 --> 00:41:17,146
Hey, Dad! George! Hey, you on the bike!

525
00:41:48,428 --> 00:41:50,470
He's a peeping Tom.

526
00:41:56,144 --> 00:41:57,186
Dad!

527
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:12,034
Hey, wait a minute. Wait<br/>a minute. Who are you?

528
00:42:14,037 --> 00:42:16,872
Stella! Another one of these damn kids

529
00:42:16,956 --> 00:42:18,332
jumped in front of my car!

530
00:42:19,334 --> 00:42:22,502
Come on out here! Help<br/>me take him in the house!

531
00:42:27,550 --> 00:42:30,010
Mom? That you?

532
00:42:31,054 --> 00:42:34,097
There, there, now. Just relax.

533
00:42:36,726 --> 00:42:39,770
You've been asleep for<br/>almost nine hours now.

534
00:42:41,606 --> 00:42:44,066
I had a horrible nightmare.

535
00:42:45,109 --> 00:42:49,655
I dreamed that I went back<br/>in time. It was terrible.

536
00:42:50,907 --> 00:42:52,032
Well,

537
00:42:52,659 --> 00:42:56,119
you're safe and sound<br/>now, back in good old 1955.

538
00:42:57,205 --> 00:42:58,622
1955?

539
00:43:03,419 --> 00:43:06,213
You're my... You're my...

540
00:43:06,297 --> 00:43:07,464
My name is Lorraine.

541
00:43:08,925 --> 00:43:10,092
Lorraine Baines.

542
00:43:10,176 --> 00:43:11,260
Yeah.

543
00:43:12,387 --> 00:43:15,055
But you're... You're so...

544
00:43:15,598 --> 00:43:18,642
You're so thin!

545
00:43:19,018 --> 00:43:22,437
Just relax, Calvin. You got<br/>a big bruise on your head.

546
00:43:26,567 --> 00:43:28,568
Where are my pants?

547
00:43:28,653 --> 00:43:31,738
Over there, on my hope chest.

548
00:43:33,616 --> 00:43:36,243
I've never seen purple<br/>underwear before, Calvin.

549
00:43:37,036 --> 00:43:39,830
Calvin? Why do you<br/>keep calling me Calvin?

550
00:43:39,914 --> 00:43:42,833
Well, that is your name,<br/>isn't it? Calvin Klein?

551
00:43:43,376 --> 00:43:46,044
It's written all over your underwear.

552
00:43:46,421 --> 00:43:48,839
Oh, I guess they call you Cal, huh?

553
00:43:49,173 --> 00:43:52,884
No, actually, people call me Marty.

554
00:43:53,219 --> 00:43:54,344
Oh.

555
00:43:54,971 --> 00:43:57,389
Pleased to meet you, Calvin.

556
00:43:58,308 --> 00:43:59,683
Marty.

557
00:44:01,102 --> 00:44:02,477
Klein.

558
00:44:09,110 --> 00:44:11,153
Do you mind if I sit here?

559
00:44:11,237 --> 00:44:12,446
No. Fine.

560
00:44:12,530 --> 00:44:14,906
No. Good. Fine. Good.

561
00:44:16,909 --> 00:44:19,119
That's a big bruise you have there.

562
00:44:20,830 --> 00:44:23,165
Lorraine, are you up there?

563
00:44:23,249 --> 00:44:25,250
Oh, my God! It's my mother!

564
00:44:25,335 --> 00:44:28,295
Quick! Put your pants back on!

565
00:44:36,554 --> 00:44:39,348
So, tell me, Marty,<br/>how long have you been in port?

566
00:44:39,432 --> 00:44:40,432
Excuse me?

567
00:44:40,516 --> 00:44:41,516
I guessed you're a sailor.

568
00:44:41,601 --> 00:44:43,769
That's why you wear that life preserver.

569
00:44:43,853 --> 00:44:45,354
Coast Guard.

570
00:44:45,438 --> 00:44:47,356
Sam, here's the young man

571
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:48,857
you hit with your car out there.

572
00:44:48,941 --> 00:44:50,025
He's all right. Thank God.

573
00:44:50,109 --> 00:44:52,319
What were you doing in the middle<br/>of the street, a kid your age?

574
00:44:52,403 --> 00:44:54,321
Don't pay attention to him.<br/>He's in one of his moods.

575
00:44:54,405 --> 00:44:55,989
Sam, you quit fiddling with that thing.

576
00:44:56,074 --> 00:44:57,491
Come in here to dinner.

577
00:44:57,575 --> 00:44:59,576
Now, let's see. You<br/>already know Lorraine.

578
00:44:59,660 --> 00:45:03,497
This is Milton, this<br/>is Sally, that's Toby,

579
00:45:03,581 --> 00:45:06,792
and over there in the<br/>playpen is little baby Joey.

580
00:45:08,461 --> 00:45:10,462
So, you're my uncle Joey.

581
00:45:11,339 --> 00:45:13,715
Better get used to these bars, kid.

582
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:17,928
Yes. Joey just loves<br/>being in his playpen.

583
00:45:18,388 --> 00:45:19,721
He cries whenever we take him out,

584
00:45:19,806 --> 00:45:21,807
so we just leave him<br/>in there all the time.

585
00:45:21,891 --> 00:45:24,101
Well, Marty, I hope you like meatloaf.

586
00:45:24,185 --> 00:45:26,395
Listen, I really ought to...

587
00:45:26,479 --> 00:45:27,687
Sit here, Marty.

588
00:45:28,272 --> 00:45:30,148
Sam, stop fiddling with that thing

589
00:45:30,233 --> 00:45:32,692
and come in here and eat your dinner.

590
00:45:34,487 --> 00:45:36,238
Look at it roll.

591
00:45:36,322 --> 00:45:38,365
Now we can watch Jackie<br/>Gleason while we eat.

592
00:45:47,333 --> 00:45:49,126
It's our first television set.

593
00:45:49,210 --> 00:45:50,836
Dad just picked it up today.

594
00:45:51,712 --> 00:45:53,797
Do you have a television?

595
00:45:53,881 --> 00:45:56,758
Well, yeah. You know<br/>we have two of them.

596
00:45:56,843 --> 00:45:59,636
Wow! You must be rich.

597
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:01,263
Oh, honey, he's teasing you.

598
00:46:01,347 --> 00:46:03,807
Nobody has two television sets.

599
00:46:08,855 --> 00:46:11,148
Hey. Hey, I've seen this one.

600
00:46:11,232 --> 00:46:12,649
I've seen this one! This is a classic.

601
00:46:12,733 --> 00:46:16,027
This is where Ralph dresses<br/>up as a man from space.

602
00:46:16,112 --> 00:46:19,531
What do you mean, you've<br/>seen this? It's brand-new.

603
00:46:19,615 --> 00:46:21,950
Yeah, well, I saw it on a rerun.

604
00:46:22,702 --> 00:46:24,494
What's a rerun?

605
00:46:24,579 --> 00:46:25,704
You'll find out.

606
00:46:26,205 --> 00:46:30,375
You know, Marty, you look so<br/>familiar to me. Do I know your mother?

607
00:46:31,794 --> 00:46:33,837
Yeah, I think maybe you do.

608
00:46:33,921 --> 00:46:35,505
Oh, then I<br/>want to give her a call.

609
00:46:35,590 --> 00:46:37,257
I don't want her to worry about you.

610
00:46:37,341 --> 00:46:38,717
You can't.

611
00:46:39,594 --> 00:46:42,888
That is, nobody's home.

612
00:46:44,182 --> 00:46:45,265
Oh.

613
00:46:45,641 --> 00:46:46,766
Yet.

614
00:46:47,310 --> 00:46:48,393
Oh.

615
00:46:49,020 --> 00:46:52,898
Listen, do you know<br/>where Riverside Drive is?

616
00:46:52,982 --> 00:46:54,483
It's on the other end of town.

617
00:46:54,567 --> 00:46:57,110
A block past Maple. East end of town.

618
00:46:57,195 --> 00:46:58,570
Wait a minute, a block past Maple.

619
00:46:58,654 --> 00:47:01,156
That's John F. Kennedy Drive.

620
00:47:02,033 --> 00:47:04,034
Who the hell is John F. Kennedy?

621
00:47:04,118 --> 00:47:05,410
Mother?

622
00:47:06,037 --> 00:47:08,663
With Marty's parents out of town,

623
00:47:09,207 --> 00:47:11,625
don't you think he<br/>ought to spend the night?

624
00:47:11,709 --> 00:47:14,127
I mean, after all, Dad almost<br/>killed him with the car.

625
00:47:14,337 --> 00:47:16,296
That's true, Marty.

626
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:18,006
I think maybe you<br/>should spend the night.

627
00:47:18,090 --> 00:47:19,633
I think you're our responsibility.

628
00:47:19,717 --> 00:47:21,343
Gee, I don't know.

629
00:47:21,427 --> 00:47:23,178
And he can sleep in my room.

630
00:47:23,888 --> 00:47:25,847
I gotta go! I gotta go!

631
00:47:25,932 --> 00:47:27,349
Thanks very much. It was wonderful.

632
00:47:27,433 --> 00:47:31,770
You were all great. See<br/>you all later. Much later.

633
00:47:36,234 --> 00:47:39,027
He's a very strange young man.

634
00:47:39,111 --> 00:47:40,237
He's an idiot.

635
00:47:40,571 --> 00:47:44,282
Comes from upbringing. His<br/>parents are probably idiots, too.

636
00:47:44,659 --> 00:47:45,867
Lorraine, you ever have a kid

637
00:47:45,952 --> 00:47:48,245
who acts that way, I'll disown you.

638
00:48:25,325 --> 00:48:26,409
Doc?

639
00:48:27,327 --> 00:48:28,869
Don't say a word.

640
00:48:30,163 --> 00:48:31,247
I don't wanna know your name.

641
00:48:31,331 --> 00:48:32,498
I don't want to know anything about you.

642
00:48:32,583 --> 00:48:34,333
Listen, Doc... Quiet!

643
00:48:34,418 --> 00:48:35,918
Doc, it's me, Marty.<br/>Don't tell me anything.

644
00:48:36,003 --> 00:48:38,170
Doc, you got to help... Quiet. Quiet.

645
00:48:40,924 --> 00:48:42,925
I'm going to read your thoughts.

646
00:48:43,010 --> 00:48:46,596
Let's see now. You've come<br/>here from a great distance?

647
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:47,805
Yeah. Exactly.

648
00:48:47,889 --> 00:48:49,015
Don't tell me!

649
00:48:49,683 --> 00:48:51,100
You want me to buy a subscription

650
00:48:51,184 --> 00:48:52,518
to the Saturday Evening Post.

651
00:48:52,603 --> 00:48:53,644
No.

652
00:48:53,729 --> 00:48:55,187
Not a word. Not a word now!

653
00:48:55,272 --> 00:48:56,439
Quiet.

654
00:48:58,609 --> 00:49:02,194
Donations. You want<br/>me to make a donation

655
00:49:02,279 --> 00:49:04,530
to the Coast Guard Youth Auxiliary.

656
00:49:05,115 --> 00:49:06,532
Doc.

657
00:49:08,035 --> 00:49:09,076
I'm from the future.

658
00:49:10,245 --> 00:49:13,372
I came here in a time<br/>machine that you invented.

659
00:49:13,749 --> 00:49:18,544
Now, I need your help to<br/>get back to the year 1985.

660
00:49:19,921 --> 00:49:21,505
My God.

661
00:49:25,927 --> 00:49:28,137
Do you know what this means?

662
00:49:29,806 --> 00:49:34,143
It means that this damn<br/>thing doesn't work at all!

663
00:49:34,227 --> 00:49:36,145
Doc, you got to help<br/>me. You are the only one

664
00:49:36,229 --> 00:49:38,564
who knows how your time machine works.

665
00:49:38,649 --> 00:49:42,485
Time machine? I haven't<br/>invented any time machine.

666
00:49:44,404 --> 00:49:46,822
Okay. All right, I'll prove it to you.

667
00:49:46,907 --> 00:49:50,076
Look at my driver's<br/>license. Expires 1987.

668
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:51,661
Look at my birthday,<br/>for crying out loud!

669
00:49:51,745 --> 00:49:53,746
I haven't even been born yet.

670
00:49:53,830 --> 00:49:56,165
And look at this picture.

671
00:49:56,249 --> 00:49:58,250
It's my brother, my sister and me.

672
00:49:58,335 --> 00:50:01,629
Look at her sweatshirt,<br/>Doc. "Class of 1984"?

673
00:50:02,589 --> 00:50:04,590
Pretty mediocre photographic fakery.

674
00:50:04,675 --> 00:50:06,926
They cut off your brother's hair.

675
00:50:07,469 --> 00:50:09,845
I'm telling the truth,<br/>Doc. You got to believe me.

676
00:50:09,930 --> 00:50:12,014
Then tell me, future boy,

677
00:50:13,183 --> 00:50:16,936
Who's President of the<br/>United States in 1985?

678
00:50:17,354 --> 00:50:18,396
Ronald Reagan.

679
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:20,856
Ronald Reagan? The actor?

680
00:50:22,442 --> 00:50:24,985
Then who's vice president? Jerry Lewis?

681
00:50:26,154 --> 00:50:28,531
I suppose Jane Wyman is the First Lady.

682
00:50:28,615 --> 00:50:29,699
Whoa. Wait, Doc!

683
00:50:29,783 --> 00:50:31,992
And Jack Benny is<br/>secretary of the treasury.

684
00:50:32,077 --> 00:50:33,494
Doc, you gotta listen to me.

685
00:50:33,578 --> 00:50:35,663
I've had enough practical<br/>jokes for one evening.

686
00:50:35,747 --> 00:50:36,914
Good night, future boy!

687
00:50:36,998 --> 00:50:38,374
No, wait, Doc. Doc.

688
00:50:38,458 --> 00:50:41,252
The bruise on your head,<br/>I know how that happened.

689
00:50:41,336 --> 00:50:42,753
You told me the whole story.

690
00:50:42,838 --> 00:50:44,296
You were standing on your toilet

691
00:50:44,381 --> 00:50:45,423
and you were hanging a clock,

692
00:50:45,507 --> 00:50:47,717
and you fell and you hit<br/>your head on the sink.

693
00:50:47,801 --> 00:50:50,720
That's when you came up with<br/>the idea for the flux capacitor,

694
00:50:50,804 --> 00:50:54,807
which is what makes<br/>time travel possible.

695
00:51:07,904 --> 00:51:12,074
There's something wrong with<br/>the starter, so I hid it here.

696
00:51:22,586 --> 00:51:26,422
After I fell off my toilet, I drew this.

697
00:51:30,927 --> 00:51:32,720
The flux capacitor.

698
00:51:50,572 --> 00:51:51,864
It works!

699
00:51:54,409 --> 00:51:55,951
It works!

700
00:51:57,245 --> 00:51:59,955
I finally invent something that works!

701
00:52:00,707 --> 00:52:02,833
You bet your ass it works.

702
00:52:03,752 --> 00:52:06,796
Somehow we've got to sneak<br/>this back to my laboratory.

703
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:08,798
We've got to get you home!

704
00:52:09,466 --> 00:52:11,258
Okay, Doc, this is it.

705
00:52:13,053 --> 00:52:15,137
Never mind that. Never mind that now.

706
00:52:15,222 --> 00:52:18,641
Why, that's me! Look<br/>at me! I'm an old man.

707
00:52:18,725 --> 00:52:19,975
Good evening. I'm Dr. Emmett Brown.

708
00:52:20,060 --> 00:52:22,144
I'm standing on the parking<br/>lot at Twin Pines Mall.

709
00:52:22,229 --> 00:52:24,230
Thank God, I've still got my hair.

710
00:52:24,314 --> 00:52:26,315
What's on Earth is<br/>this thing I'm wearing?

711
00:52:26,399 --> 00:52:28,567
This is a radiation suit.

712
00:52:28,652 --> 00:52:30,402
Radiation suit?

713
00:52:30,487 --> 00:52:33,489
Of course. 'Cause of all the<br/>fallout from the atomic wars.

714
00:52:34,825 --> 00:52:37,493
This is truly amazing.

715
00:52:37,994 --> 00:52:40,830
A portable television studio.

716
00:52:40,914 --> 00:52:42,414
No wonder your president<br/>has to be an actor.

717
00:52:42,499 --> 00:52:44,667
He's gotta look good on television.

718
00:52:44,751 --> 00:52:47,169
Whoa. This is it. This is<br/>the part coming up, Doc.

719
00:52:47,921 --> 00:52:49,380
No, no, no, this sucker's electrical,

720
00:52:49,464 --> 00:52:50,506
but I need a nuclear reaction

721
00:52:50,590 --> 00:52:52,383
to generate the 1.21 gigawatts...

722
00:52:52,467 --> 00:52:54,260
What did I just say?

723
00:52:58,265 --> 00:52:59,348
This sucker's electrical,

724
00:52:59,432 --> 00:53:00,558
but I need a nuclear reaction

725
00:53:00,642 --> 00:53:02,351
to generate the 1.21 gigawatts...

726
00:53:02,435 --> 00:53:04,770
1.21 gigawatts!

727
00:53:06,273 --> 00:53:08,482
1.21 gigawatts.

728
00:53:10,485 --> 00:53:12,111
Great Scott!

729
00:53:14,281 --> 00:53:16,490
What the hell is a gigawatt?

730
00:53:17,492 --> 00:53:21,579
How could I have been so<br/>careless? 1.21 gigawatts!

731
00:53:21,663 --> 00:53:24,373
Tom, how am I going to<br/>generate that kind of power?

732
00:53:24,457 --> 00:53:26,083
It can't be done, can it?

733
00:53:26,167 --> 00:53:28,919
Doc, look. All we need<br/>is a little plutonium.

734
00:53:30,130 --> 00:53:31,881
I'm sure that in 1985,

735
00:53:31,965 --> 00:53:34,133
plutonium is available<br/>in every corner drugstore,

736
00:53:34,217 --> 00:53:36,969
but in 1955, it's a<br/>little hard to come by.

737
00:53:37,053 --> 00:53:40,389
Marty, I'm sorry, but I'm<br/>afraid you're stuck here.

738
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:41,640
Whoa, whoa.

739
00:53:41,725 --> 00:53:46,145
Doc, stuck here? I can't be<br/>stuck here. I got a life in 1985.

740
00:53:46,229 --> 00:53:47,313
I got a girl.

741
00:53:47,397 --> 00:53:48,439
Is she pretty?

742
00:53:48,982 --> 00:53:52,943
Doc, she's beautiful.<br/>She's crazy about me.

743
00:53:53,028 --> 00:53:57,323
Look at this. Look what she wrote<br/>here, Doc. I mean, that says it all.

744
00:53:58,575 --> 00:54:01,160
Doc, you're my only hope.

745
00:54:01,828 --> 00:54:05,164
Marty, I'm sorry, but the only<br/>power source capable of generating

746
00:54:05,248 --> 00:54:08,667
1.21 gigawatts of electricity<br/>is a bolt of lightning.

747
00:54:09,878 --> 00:54:11,003
What did you say?

748
00:54:11,087 --> 00:54:12,254
A bolt of lightning.

749
00:54:12,339 --> 00:54:13,339
Unfortunately, you never know

750
00:54:13,423 --> 00:54:16,550
when or where it's ever going to strike.

751
00:54:18,053 --> 00:54:19,428
We do now.

752
00:54:24,517 --> 00:54:28,103
This is it! This is the answer.

753
00:54:28,855 --> 00:54:31,273
It says here that a bolt of lightning

754
00:54:31,358 --> 00:54:32,358
is going to strike the clock tower

755
00:54:32,442 --> 00:54:35,694
at precisely 10:04 p.m.<br/>Next Saturday night!

756
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:42,701
If we could somehow<br/>harness this lightning,

757
00:54:43,870 --> 00:54:47,122
channel it into the flux capacitor,

758
00:54:48,416 --> 00:54:50,209
it just might work.

759
00:54:50,502 --> 00:54:54,755
Next Saturday night, we're<br/>sending you back to the future!

760
00:54:55,715 --> 00:54:57,591
Okay, all right. Saturday's<br/>good. Saturday's good.

761
00:54:57,676 --> 00:54:59,468
I can spend a week in 1955.

762
00:54:59,552 --> 00:55:01,303
I can hang out. You can show me around.

763
00:55:01,388 --> 00:55:03,222
Marty, that is completely<br/>out of the question.

764
00:55:03,306 --> 00:55:04,640
You must not leave this house.

765
00:55:04,724 --> 00:55:06,725
You must not see anybody<br/>or talk to anybody.

766
00:55:06,810 --> 00:55:09,395
Anything you do can have serious<br/>repercussions on future events.

767
00:55:09,479 --> 00:55:11,230
Do you understand?

768
00:55:12,107 --> 00:55:14,066
Yeah. Sure. Okay.

769
00:55:14,693 --> 00:55:15,901
Marty,

770
00:55:16,319 --> 00:55:19,780
have you interacted with<br/>anybody else today, besides me?

771
00:55:21,574 --> 00:55:24,702
Yeah, well, I might've sort<br/>of bumped into my parents.

772
00:55:24,786 --> 00:55:26,328
Great Scott!

773
00:55:26,413 --> 00:55:28,706
Let me see that photograph<br/>again of your brother.

774
00:55:32,085 --> 00:55:35,504
Just as I thought. This proves<br/>my theory. Look at your brother.

775
00:55:36,756 --> 00:55:39,967
His head's gone.<br/>It's like it's been erased.

776
00:55:41,636 --> 00:55:43,679
Erased from existence.

777
00:55:48,268 --> 00:55:49,351
Whoa.

778
00:55:49,436 --> 00:55:52,187
They really cleaned this<br/>place up. Looks brand-new.

779
00:55:52,272 --> 00:55:53,272
Now remember.

780
00:55:53,356 --> 00:55:54,606
According to my theory, you interfered

781
00:55:54,691 --> 00:55:55,858
with your parents' first meeting.

782
00:55:55,942 --> 00:55:57,192
If they don't meet,<br/>they won't fall in love,

783
00:55:57,277 --> 00:55:59,069
they won't get married<br/>and they won't have kids.

784
00:55:59,154 --> 00:56:00,195
That's why your older brother's

785
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:01,530
disappearing from that photograph.

786
00:56:01,614 --> 00:56:03,824
Your sister will follow, and<br/>unless you repair the damage,

787
00:56:03,908 --> 00:56:05,117
you'll be next.

788
00:56:05,201 --> 00:56:07,036
Sounds pretty heavy.<br/>Weight has nothing to do with it.

789
00:56:08,246 --> 00:56:10,122
Which one's your pop?

790
00:56:11,291 --> 00:56:12,624
That's him.

791
00:56:13,084 --> 00:56:15,502
Okay. Okay, you guys.

792
00:56:17,130 --> 00:56:20,382
Very funny. You guys<br/>are being real mature.

793
00:56:20,467 --> 00:56:22,342
Maybe you were adopted.

794
00:56:22,427 --> 00:56:24,970
Okay, real mature, guys.

795
00:56:25,889 --> 00:56:27,264
Okay, pick up my books.

796
00:56:27,348 --> 00:56:28,390
McFly.

797
00:56:28,475 --> 00:56:30,184
That's Strickland.

798
00:56:30,643 --> 00:56:32,728
Jesus, didn't that guy ever have hair?

799
00:56:32,812 --> 00:56:35,564
Shape up, man. You're a slacker.

800
00:56:35,648 --> 00:56:38,734
Do you want to be a slacker<br/>for the rest of your life?

801
00:56:38,818 --> 00:56:39,860
No.

802
00:56:40,236 --> 00:56:41,779
What did your mother<br/>ever see in that kid?

803
00:56:41,863 --> 00:56:43,155
I don't know, Doc.

804
00:56:43,239 --> 00:56:44,948
I guess she felt sorry for him

805
00:56:45,033 --> 00:56:47,367
'cause her dad hit him with the car.

806
00:56:47,660 --> 00:56:49,912
Hit me with the car.

807
00:56:49,996 --> 00:56:51,997
That's the Florence Nightingale effect.

808
00:56:52,082 --> 00:56:55,417
It happens in hospitals when nurses<br/>fall in love with their patients.

809
00:56:55,502 --> 00:56:56,752
Go to it, kid.

810
00:56:57,587 --> 00:57:00,422
Hey, George, buddy.

811
00:57:01,007 --> 00:57:03,383
I have been looking all over for you.

812
00:57:03,468 --> 00:57:06,428
You remember me, the guy who<br/>saved your life the other day?

813
00:57:06,513 --> 00:57:07,596
Oh.

814
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:08,680
Yeah. Good.

815
00:57:07,765 --> 00:57:09,766
There's somebody I'd like you to meet.

816
00:57:14,188 --> 00:57:15,772
Lorraine?

817
00:57:15,856 --> 00:57:16,981
Calvin!

818
00:57:18,442 --> 00:57:21,194
I'd like you to meet my<br/>good friend George McFly.

819
00:57:21,278 --> 00:57:24,531
Hi. It's really a pleasure to meet you.

820
00:57:25,699 --> 00:57:26,741
How's your head?

821
00:57:26,826 --> 00:57:28,159
Good. Fine.

822
00:57:28,244 --> 00:57:30,120
Oh. I've been so worried about you

823
00:57:30,204 --> 00:57:32,080
ever since you ran off the other night.

824
00:57:32,164 --> 00:57:33,623
Are you okay? Yeah.

825
00:57:34,875 --> 00:57:36,126
I'm sorry. I have to go.

826
00:57:36,210 --> 00:57:37,460
Come on!

827
00:57:38,295 --> 00:57:40,130
Isn't he a dreamboat?

828
00:57:44,260 --> 00:57:45,844
Doc, she didn't even look at him.

829
00:57:45,928 --> 00:57:47,470
This is more serious than I thought.

830
00:57:47,555 --> 00:57:49,514
Apparently, your mother is<br/>amorously infatuated with you,

831
00:57:49,598 --> 00:57:51,224
instead of your father.

832
00:57:51,851 --> 00:57:52,976
Whoa. Wait a minute, Doc.

833
00:57:53,060 --> 00:57:56,729
Are you trying to tell me that<br/>my mother has got the hots for me?

834
00:57:56,814 --> 00:57:57,939
Precisely.

835
00:57:58,023 --> 00:57:59,065
Whoa. This is heavy.

836
00:57:59,650 --> 00:58:01,734
There's that word again. "Heavy."

837
00:58:01,819 --> 00:58:03,153
Why are things so heavy in the future?

838
00:58:03,237 --> 00:58:05,321
Is there a problem with the<br/>Earth's gravitational pull?

839
00:58:05,406 --> 00:58:06,489
What? The only way

840
00:58:06,574 --> 00:58:07,991
we're going to get those<br/>two to successfully mate

841
00:58:08,075 --> 00:58:09,450
is if they're alone together,

842
00:58:09,535 --> 00:58:12,162
so you've got to get your<br/>father and mother to interact

843
00:58:12,246 --> 00:58:14,330
in some sort of social...

844
00:58:15,666 --> 00:58:17,208
What? You mean like a date? Right!

845
00:58:18,419 --> 00:58:19,502
What kind of date? I don't know.

846
00:58:19,587 --> 00:58:21,129
What do kids do in the '50s?

847
00:58:21,213 --> 00:58:24,007
They're your parents.<br/>You must know them.

848
00:58:24,091 --> 00:58:25,216
What are their common interests?

849
00:58:25,301 --> 00:58:27,260
What do they like to do together?

850
00:58:28,262 --> 00:58:29,345
Nothing.

851
00:58:29,430 --> 00:58:32,640
Look! There's a rhythmic<br/>ceremonial ritual coming up.

852
00:58:32,725 --> 00:58:34,684
Of course! The Enchantment<br/>Under the Sea dance!

853
00:58:34,768 --> 00:58:36,144
They're supposed to go to this.

854
00:58:36,228 --> 00:58:37,979
That's where they kiss<br/>for the first time.

855
00:58:38,063 --> 00:58:39,439
All right, kid.

856
00:58:39,523 --> 00:58:41,107
You stick to your father like glue

857
00:58:41,192 --> 00:58:42,734
and make sure he takes<br/>her to that dance.

858
00:58:43,444 --> 00:58:44,944
George, buddy.

859
00:58:45,779 --> 00:58:49,032
Remember that girl I<br/>introduced you to, Lorraine?

860
00:58:55,080 --> 00:58:56,706
What are you writing?

861
00:58:56,790 --> 00:58:58,791
Uh... Stories.

862
00:58:59,627 --> 00:59:03,171
Science fiction stories about visitors

863
00:59:03,631 --> 00:59:06,883
coming down to Earth from other planets.

864
00:59:08,928 --> 00:59:12,597
Get out of town! I didn't<br/>know you did anything creative.

865
00:59:13,098 --> 00:59:14,224
Let me read some.

866
00:59:14,308 --> 00:59:15,892
Oh. No, no, no, no.

867
00:59:15,976 --> 00:59:18,811
I never let anybody read my stories.

868
00:59:19,563 --> 00:59:20,813
Why not?

869
00:59:21,232 --> 00:59:23,107
Well, what if they didn't like them?

870
00:59:23,192 --> 00:59:25,652
What if they told me I was no good?

871
00:59:27,738 --> 00:59:30,573
I guess that would be pretty<br/>hard for somebody to understand.

872
00:59:31,992 --> 00:59:34,577
No. No, not hard at all.

873
00:59:35,788 --> 00:59:38,331
So, anyway, George. About Lorraine.

874
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:41,334
She really likes you.

875
00:59:42,294 --> 00:59:45,255
She told me to tell you<br/>that she wants you to ask her

876
00:59:45,339 --> 00:59:47,090
to the Enchantment Under the Sea dance.

877
00:59:47,174 --> 00:59:48,341
Really? Oh, yeah.

878
00:59:48,425 --> 00:59:51,511
All you got to do is go<br/>over there and ask her.

879
00:59:52,429 --> 00:59:54,597
What? Right here, right<br/>now, in the cafeteria?

880
00:59:54,682 --> 00:59:55,765
What if she said no?

881
00:59:55,849 --> 00:59:59,310
I don't know if I could take<br/>that kind of a rejection.

882
01:00:00,104 --> 01:00:04,023
Besides, I think she'd<br/>rather go with somebody else.

883
01:00:05,359 --> 01:00:06,526
Who?

884
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:09,445
Biff.

885
01:00:10,990 --> 01:00:12,115
Don't kid around. Come on.

886
01:00:12,199 --> 01:00:13,449
I'm gonna leave.

887
01:00:13,534 --> 01:00:15,410
You want it. You know you want it.

888
01:00:15,494 --> 01:00:17,620
You know you want me to give it to you.

889
01:00:17,705 --> 01:00:20,290
Shut your filthy mouth.<br/>I'm not that kind of girl.

890
01:00:21,542 --> 01:00:24,294
Maybe you are and you<br/>just don't know it yet.

891
01:00:24,378 --> 01:00:26,212
Get your meat hooks off of me.

892
01:00:26,297 --> 01:00:27,338
You heard her.

893
01:00:27,423 --> 01:00:30,800
She said, get your meat hooks off.

894
01:00:32,219 --> 01:00:33,469
Please.

895
01:00:34,305 --> 01:00:36,389
So what's it to you, butthead?

896
01:00:37,516 --> 01:00:39,767
You know, you been looking for a fight.

897
01:00:49,695 --> 01:00:53,740
Since you're new here, I'm<br/>going to cut you a break, today.

898
01:00:55,576 --> 01:00:59,329
So, why don't you make like<br/>a tree and get out of here.

899
01:01:12,051 --> 01:01:13,259
George!

900
01:01:14,595 --> 01:01:16,637
Why do you keep following me around?

901
01:01:16,722 --> 01:01:19,682
Look, George... I'm telling you, George,

902
01:01:19,767 --> 01:01:21,517
if you do not ask<br/>Lorraine to that dance,

903
01:01:21,602 --> 01:01:23,102
I'm gonna regret it<br/>for the rest of my life.

904
01:01:23,187 --> 01:01:24,645
But I can't go to the dance.

905
01:01:24,730 --> 01:01:27,857
I'll miss my favorite television<br/>program, Science Fiction Theatre.

906
01:01:27,941 --> 01:01:31,319
Yeah, but, George, Lorraine<br/>wants to go with you.

907
01:01:31,403 --> 01:01:32,528
Give her a break.

908
01:01:32,613 --> 01:01:36,783
Look, I'm just not ready to<br/>ask Lorraine out to the dance,

909
01:01:37,576 --> 01:01:40,787
and not you or anybody<br/>else on this planet

910
01:01:40,871 --> 01:01:43,456
is going to make me change my mind.

911
01:01:50,255 --> 01:01:52,256
Science Fiction Theatre.

912
01:02:23,831 --> 01:02:24,872
Who are you?

913
01:02:30,462 --> 01:02:32,505
Silence, Earthling.

914
01:02:33,966 --> 01:02:36,426
My name is Darth Vader.

915
01:02:41,473 --> 01:02:44,934
I am an extraterrestrial<br/>from the planet Vulcan.

916
01:02:47,020 --> 01:02:48,187
Marty!

917
01:02:51,358 --> 01:02:52,442
Marty! Marty!

918
01:02:52,526 --> 01:02:53,609
Hey, George, buddy.

919
01:02:53,694 --> 01:02:56,070
You weren't at school. What<br/>have you been doing all day?

920
01:02:56,155 --> 01:02:59,073
I overslept. Look, I need your help.

921
01:02:59,158 --> 01:03:00,616
I have to ask Lorraine out,

922
01:03:00,701 --> 01:03:01,784
but I don't know how to do it.

923
01:03:01,869 --> 01:03:04,704
All right. Okay, listen, keep your<br/>pants on. She's over in the cafe.

924
01:03:04,788 --> 01:03:06,831
God! How do you...

925
01:03:09,918 --> 01:03:11,377
What made you change your mind, George?

926
01:03:11,462 --> 01:03:14,380
Last night, Darth Vader<br/>came down from Planet Vulcan

927
01:03:14,465 --> 01:03:18,384
and told me that if I didn't take<br/>Lorraine out, that he'd melt my brain.

928
01:03:18,469 --> 01:03:21,554
Let's just keep this brain-melting<br/>stuff to ourselves, okay?

929
01:03:21,638 --> 01:03:22,763
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

930
01:03:22,848 --> 01:03:25,141
All right, okay. There she is, George.

931
01:03:25,225 --> 01:03:26,976
Now just go in there and invite her.

932
01:03:27,060 --> 01:03:28,644
Okay. But I don't know what to say.

933
01:03:28,729 --> 01:03:29,812
Just say anything, George.

934
01:03:29,897 --> 01:03:33,941
Say whatever's natural, the first<br/>thing that comes into your mind.

935
01:03:34,568 --> 01:03:36,486
Nothing's coming to my mind.

936
01:03:36,570 --> 01:03:38,279
Jesus, George, it's a<br/>wonder I was even born.

937
01:03:38,363 --> 01:03:39,322
What? What?

938
01:03:39,406 --> 01:03:40,907
Nothing. Nothing. Nothing.

939
01:03:41,492 --> 01:03:45,578
Look, tell her destiny<br/>brought you together.

940
01:03:45,662 --> 01:03:47,580
Tell her that she is<br/>the most beautiful girl

941
01:03:47,664 --> 01:03:49,499
you have ever seen in the world.

942
01:03:49,583 --> 01:03:51,542
Girls like that stuff.

943
01:03:51,919 --> 01:03:52,919
What are you doing, George?

944
01:03:53,003 --> 01:03:54,795
I'm writing this down.<br/>This is good stuff.

945
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:56,380
Yeah. Okay, let's go.

946
01:03:56,465 --> 01:03:57,924
Can you take care of that? Right.

947
01:04:16,443 --> 01:04:19,362
Lou, give me a milk.

948
01:04:20,739 --> 01:04:22,114
Chocolate.

949
01:04:38,298 --> 01:04:43,386
Lorraine. My density<br/>has popped me to you.

950
01:04:44,763 --> 01:04:45,972
What?

951
01:04:46,139 --> 01:04:47,223
Oh.

952
01:04:48,058 --> 01:04:50,726
What I meant to say was...

953
01:04:50,811 --> 01:04:53,896
Wait a minute. Don't I<br/>know you from somewhere?

954
01:04:54,314 --> 01:04:55,439
Yes.

955
01:04:55,732 --> 01:04:59,652
Yes. I'm George. George McFly.

956
01:05:00,279 --> 01:05:01,946
I'm your density.

957
01:05:02,948 --> 01:05:04,240
I mean,

958
01:05:05,659 --> 01:05:07,076
your destiny.

959
01:05:08,287 --> 01:05:09,370
Oh.

960
01:05:10,080 --> 01:05:11,497
Hey, McFly.

961
01:05:15,919 --> 01:05:18,838
I thought I told you<br/>never to come in here.

962
01:05:21,341 --> 01:05:23,551
Well, it's going to cost you.

963
01:05:23,927 --> 01:05:26,178
How much money you got on you?

964
01:05:26,513 --> 01:05:28,639
How much do you want, Biff?

965
01:05:36,857 --> 01:05:38,441
All right, punk.

966
01:05:38,525 --> 01:05:39,525
Now I'm going to...

967
01:05:39,610 --> 01:05:41,277
Whoa, whoa, Biff. What's that?

968
01:05:47,993 --> 01:05:51,037
That's Calvin Klein.<br/>Oh, my God, he's a dream.

969
01:05:51,204 --> 01:05:52,246
Whoa, whoa.

970
01:05:52,331 --> 01:05:54,123
Kid! Kid, stop! Stop!

971
01:05:54,207 --> 01:05:55,374
Hey!

972
01:05:57,544 --> 01:05:58,628
I'll get it<br/>back to you, all right?

973
01:05:59,671 --> 01:06:01,380
You broke it!

974
01:06:01,715 --> 01:06:02,798
Come back here!

975
01:06:05,010 --> 01:06:06,761
Wow. Look at him go!

976
01:06:08,639 --> 01:06:09,889
Get him!

977
01:06:23,236 --> 01:06:25,404
To the car! Go! Go!

978
01:06:31,703 --> 01:06:32,953
What's that thing he's on?

979
01:06:33,038 --> 01:06:34,497
It's a board with wheels.

980
01:06:34,581 --> 01:06:36,165
He's an absolute dream.

981
01:06:36,249 --> 01:06:37,458
Come on, come on!

982
01:06:37,542 --> 01:06:39,085
Look out for the car!

983
01:06:54,851 --> 01:06:56,102
Whoa!

984
01:07:12,411 --> 01:07:14,245
I'm going to ram him.

985
01:07:21,628 --> 01:07:22,795
Shit!

986
01:07:34,349 --> 01:07:35,474
Ooh!

987
01:07:48,029 --> 01:07:49,739
Thanks a lot, kid.

988
01:07:50,866 --> 01:07:53,284
I'm going to get that son of a bitch.

989
01:07:53,368 --> 01:07:54,410
Where does he come from?

990
01:07:54,494 --> 01:07:56,370
Yeah, where does he live?

991
01:07:57,080 --> 01:08:00,666
I don't know, but I'm going to find out.

992
01:08:06,506 --> 01:08:07,840
Oh, my God.

993
01:08:08,258 --> 01:08:11,343
They found me. I don't<br/>know how, but they found me.

994
01:08:11,428 --> 01:08:13,095
Run for it, Marty!

995
01:08:17,809 --> 01:08:19,185
Oh, my God.

996
01:08:19,978 --> 01:08:22,897
They found me. I don't<br/>know how, but they found me.

997
01:08:22,981 --> 01:08:24,356
Run for it, Marty!

998
01:08:25,650 --> 01:08:26,734
Doc?

999
01:08:27,486 --> 01:08:30,446
Hi, Marty. I didn't hear you come in.

1000
01:08:31,406 --> 01:08:33,949
Fascinating device, this video unit.

1001
01:08:34,951 --> 01:08:36,619
Listen, Doc.

1002
01:08:36,703 --> 01:08:37,661
You know, there's something

1003
01:08:37,746 --> 01:08:38,913
I haven't told you about the night

1004
01:08:39,039 --> 01:08:40,331
we made that tape. Please,<br/>Marty, don't tell me.

1005
01:08:40,415 --> 01:08:41,707
No man should know too<br/>much about his own destiny.

1006
01:08:41,792 --> 01:08:43,167
You don't understand. I do understand.

1007
01:08:43,251 --> 01:08:44,460
If I know too much about my own future,

1008
01:08:44,544 --> 01:08:45,961
I can endanger my own existence.

1009
01:08:46,046 --> 01:08:48,380
Just as you've endangered yours.

1010
01:08:50,342 --> 01:08:52,259
You're right. Now...

1011
01:08:52,344 --> 01:08:55,221
Let me show you my plan<br/>for sending you home.

1012
01:08:55,305 --> 01:08:57,056
Please excuse the crudity of this model.

1013
01:08:57,140 --> 01:08:59,475
I didn't have time to build<br/>it to scale or paint it.

1014
01:08:59,559 --> 01:09:01,477
It's good. Thank you. Thank you.

1015
01:09:02,771 --> 01:09:03,979
Okay, now.

1016
01:09:04,064 --> 01:09:06,273
We run some industrial-strength<br/>electrical cable

1017
01:09:06,358 --> 01:09:08,192
from the top of the clock tower

1018
01:09:08,276 --> 01:09:09,902
down, suspending it over the street

1019
01:09:09,986 --> 01:09:11,570
between these two lamp posts.

1020
01:09:12,197 --> 01:09:14,657
Meanwhile, we've<br/>outfitted the time vehicle

1021
01:09:14,741 --> 01:09:16,200
with this big pole and hook,

1022
01:09:16,284 --> 01:09:19,245
which runs directly<br/>into the flux capacitor.

1023
01:09:20,163 --> 01:09:24,834
At the calculated moment, you<br/>start off from down the street,

1024
01:09:24,918 --> 01:09:26,168
driving directly toward the cable,

1025
01:09:26,253 --> 01:09:29,171
accelerating to 88 miles per hour.

1026
01:09:29,506 --> 01:09:32,883
According to the flyer, at precisely<br/>10:04 p.m. This Saturday night,

1027
01:09:32,968 --> 01:09:36,595
lightning will strike the clock<br/>tower, electrifying the cable

1028
01:09:36,680 --> 01:09:38,931
just as the connecting<br/>hook makes contact

1029
01:09:39,015 --> 01:09:42,643
thereby sending 1.21 gigawatts<br/>into the flux capacitor

1030
01:09:43,019 --> 01:09:45,187
and sending you back to 1985.

1031
01:09:45,272 --> 01:09:47,314
All right, now. Watch this.

1032
01:09:47,399 --> 01:09:49,316
You wind up the car and release it.

1033
01:09:51,111 --> 01:09:53,320
I'll simulate the lightning.

1034
01:10:01,621 --> 01:10:02,788
Ready.

1035
01:10:12,549 --> 01:10:13,674
Set.

1036
01:10:18,722 --> 01:10:19,972
Release.

1037
01:10:38,366 --> 01:10:40,534
You're instilling me with<br/>a lot of confidence, Doc.

1038
01:10:40,619 --> 01:10:41,994
Don't worry. I'll take<br/>care of the lightning.

1039
01:10:42,078 --> 01:10:44,663
You take care of your pop.

1040
01:10:45,832 --> 01:10:48,834
By the way, what happened<br/>today? Did he ask her out?

1041
01:10:48,919 --> 01:10:50,044
I think so.

1042
01:10:50,128 --> 01:10:51,170
What did she say?

1043
01:10:59,846 --> 01:11:01,597
It's your mom! She's tracked you down!

1044
01:11:01,681 --> 01:11:03,933
Quick! Let's cover the time machine.

1045
01:11:17,280 --> 01:11:19,740
Hi, Cal... Marty.

1046
01:11:20,241 --> 01:11:21,659
Mom. Lorraine.

1047
01:11:23,203 --> 01:11:25,412
How did you know I was here?

1048
01:11:26,331 --> 01:11:27,873
I followed you.

1049
01:11:28,708 --> 01:11:30,709
Oh. This is my doc...

1050
01:11:30,794 --> 01:11:33,879
My uncle, Doc Brown.

1051
01:11:35,215 --> 01:11:36,465
Hi. Hi.

1052
01:11:39,552 --> 01:11:42,721
Marty, this may seem a little forward,

1053
01:11:43,098 --> 01:11:47,309
but I was kind of<br/>wondering if you'd ask me

1054
01:11:47,394 --> 01:11:51,230
to the Enchantment Under<br/>the Sea dance on Saturday.

1055
01:11:53,900 --> 01:11:57,111
Wow, you mean... You<br/>mean nobody's asked you?

1056
01:11:57,779 --> 01:12:00,864
No. Not yet.

1057
01:12:02,575 --> 01:12:04,118
What about George?

1058
01:12:04,202 --> 01:12:05,995
George McFly?

1059
01:12:08,540 --> 01:12:12,543
He's kind of cute and all, but not...

1060
01:12:13,420 --> 01:12:17,548
Well, I think a man should be strong,

1061
01:12:19,467 --> 01:12:21,719
so he can stand up for himself

1062
01:12:22,762 --> 01:12:25,014
and protect the woman he loves.

1063
01:12:29,728 --> 01:12:31,103
Don't you?

1064
01:12:32,605 --> 01:12:33,689
Yeah.

1065
01:12:34,149 --> 01:12:36,150
I still don't understand.

1066
01:12:36,609 --> 01:12:39,319
How am I supposed to<br/>go to the dance with her

1067
01:12:39,404 --> 01:12:42,156
if she's already going<br/>to the dance with you?

1068
01:12:42,240 --> 01:12:44,908
Well, because, George,<br/>she wants to go with you.

1069
01:12:44,993 --> 01:12:46,910
She just doesn't know it yet.

1070
01:12:46,995 --> 01:12:47,995
That's why we got to show her

1071
01:12:48,079 --> 01:12:50,039
that you, George McFly, are a fighter.

1072
01:12:50,123 --> 01:12:52,041
You're somebody who's<br/>gonna stand up for yourself,

1073
01:12:52,125 --> 01:12:53,584
somebody who's gonna protect her.

1074
01:12:53,668 --> 01:12:56,879
Yeah, but I've never picked<br/>a fight in my entire life.

1075
01:12:56,963 --> 01:12:59,715
Look, you're not going to<br/>be picking a fight, Dad.

1076
01:12:59,799 --> 01:13:02,009
Daddy-o.

1077
01:13:02,093 --> 01:13:04,386
You're coming to her rescue, right?

1078
01:13:04,471 --> 01:13:05,637
Okay, let's go over the plan again.

1079
01:13:05,722 --> 01:13:07,473
8:55, where are you going to be?

1080
01:13:07,557 --> 01:13:09,141
I'm going to be at the dance.

1081
01:13:09,225 --> 01:13:10,267
Right. And where am I going to be?

1082
01:13:10,351 --> 01:13:12,352
You're gonna be in the car with her.

1083
01:13:12,437 --> 01:13:13,896
Right, okay. So, right around 9:00,

1084
01:13:13,980 --> 01:13:15,397
she's going to get very angry with me.

1085
01:13:15,482 --> 01:13:17,900
Why is she going to get angry with you?

1086
01:13:17,984 --> 01:13:20,319
Well, because, George,<br/>nice girls get angry

1087
01:13:20,403 --> 01:13:22,654
when guys take advantage of them.

1088
01:13:24,908 --> 01:13:26,909
You mean you're going<br/>to go touch her on her...

1089
01:13:26,993 --> 01:13:29,453
No. No, George, look.

1090
01:13:30,288 --> 01:13:32,247
It's just an act, right?

1091
01:13:32,540 --> 01:13:36,043
Okay. So, 9:00, you're strolling<br/>through the parking lot.

1092
01:13:36,461 --> 01:13:39,671
You see us struggling in the car.

1093
01:13:40,090 --> 01:13:43,258
You walk up, you open<br/>the door, and you say...

1094
01:13:44,886 --> 01:13:46,637
Your line, George.

1095
01:13:47,931 --> 01:13:49,098
Oh!

1096
01:13:49,766 --> 01:13:52,601
Hey, you, get your damn hands off her!

1097
01:13:54,938 --> 01:13:56,271
You really think I ought to swear?

1098
01:13:56,356 --> 01:13:57,356
Yes, definitely.

1099
01:13:57,440 --> 01:13:59,066
God damn it, George, swear.

1100
01:13:59,150 --> 01:14:01,151
Okay. So, now you come up.

1101
01:14:01,236 --> 01:14:02,361
You punch me in the stomach.

1102
01:14:02,445 --> 01:14:04,238
I'm out for the count, right?

1103
01:14:04,322 --> 01:14:07,533
And you and Lorraine<br/>live happily ever after.

1104
01:14:07,617 --> 01:14:09,827
You make it sound so easy.

1105
01:14:09,911 --> 01:14:12,371
I just... I wish I wasn't so scared.

1106
01:14:12,455 --> 01:14:13,705
George, there's nothing to be scared of.

1107
01:14:13,790 --> 01:14:16,333
All it takes is a<br/>little self-confidence.

1108
01:14:16,417 --> 01:14:19,128
You know, if you put your mind to it,

1109
01:14:19,212 --> 01:14:20,671
you can accomplish anything.

1110
01:14:23,299 --> 01:14:25,509
...Hill Valley area<br/>weather this Saturday night.

1111
01:14:25,593 --> 01:14:28,595
Mostly clear, with<br/>some scattered clouds.

1112
01:14:28,680 --> 01:14:30,389
Lows tonight in the upper 40s.

1113
01:14:30,473 --> 01:14:32,391
Are you sure about this storm?

1114
01:14:33,226 --> 01:14:37,396
Since when can weathermen predict<br/>the weather, let alone the future?

1115
01:14:37,897 --> 01:14:40,566
You know, Marty, I'm going<br/>to be very sad to see you go.

1116
01:14:40,650 --> 01:14:41,859
You've really made a<br/>difference in my life.

1117
01:14:41,943 --> 01:14:44,069
You've given me something to shoot for.

1118
01:14:44,154 --> 01:14:48,323
Just knowing that I'm going<br/>to be around to see 1985.

1119
01:14:48,408 --> 01:14:50,325
That I'm going to succeed in this!

1120
01:14:50,410 --> 01:14:53,954
That I'm going to have a<br/>chance to travel through time!

1121
01:14:59,419 --> 01:15:02,087
It's going to be really hard waiting<br/>30 years before I can talk to you

1122
01:15:02,172 --> 01:15:05,132
about everything that's<br/>happened in the past few days.

1123
01:15:05,216 --> 01:15:07,801
I'm really going to miss you, Marty.

1124
01:15:09,137 --> 01:15:10,971
I'm really going to miss you.

1125
01:15:15,351 --> 01:15:16,518
Doc, about the future...

1126
01:15:16,603 --> 01:15:17,686
No!

1127
01:15:18,354 --> 01:15:20,689
Marty! We've already agreed

1128
01:15:20,773 --> 01:15:22,065
that having information about the future

1129
01:15:22,150 --> 01:15:23,609
can be extremely dangerous.

1130
01:15:23,693 --> 01:15:25,194
Even if your intentions are good,

1131
01:15:25,278 --> 01:15:27,237
it can backfire drastically.

1132
01:15:28,489 --> 01:15:29,698
Whatever you've got to tell me,

1133
01:15:29,782 --> 01:15:32,868
I'll find out through the<br/>natural course of time.

1134
01:15:33,912 --> 01:15:35,871
"Dear Dr. Brown.

1135
01:15:36,623 --> 01:15:39,082
"On the night that I go back in time,

1136
01:15:39,542 --> 01:15:41,293
"you will be

1137
01:15:41,878 --> 01:15:44,171
"shot by terrorists.

1138
01:15:45,298 --> 01:15:47,758
"Please take whatever<br/>precautions are necessary

1139
01:15:47,842 --> 01:15:50,302
"to prevent this terrible disaster.

1140
01:15:51,721 --> 01:15:53,430
"Your friend,

1141
01:15:54,474 --> 01:15:55,724
"Marty."

1142
01:16:05,151 --> 01:16:08,111
'Evening, Dr. Brown.<br/>What's with the wire?

1143
01:16:08,196 --> 01:16:11,114
Oh, just a little weather experiment.

1144
01:16:12,951 --> 01:16:13,951
What you got under here?

1145
01:16:14,035 --> 01:16:15,035
No! Don't touch that!

1146
01:16:15,119 --> 01:16:17,913
Some new, specialized<br/>weather-sensing equipment.

1147
01:16:17,997 --> 01:16:20,207
You got a permit for that?

1148
01:16:20,291 --> 01:16:21,583
Of course I do.

1149
01:16:29,050 --> 01:16:32,177
Just a second. Let me<br/>see if I can find it here.

1150
01:17:24,314 --> 01:17:28,900
Do you mind if we park for a while?

1151
01:17:30,111 --> 01:17:32,112
That's a great idea. I'd love to park.

1152
01:17:32,196 --> 01:17:33,196
Huh?

1153
01:17:33,281 --> 01:17:35,991
Marty, I'm almost 18 years old.

1154
01:17:36,075 --> 01:17:37,993
It's not like I've never parked before.

1155
01:17:38,786 --> 01:17:40,078
What?

1156
01:17:40,621 --> 01:17:43,623
Marty, you seem so<br/>nervous. Is something wrong?

1157
01:17:43,708 --> 01:17:47,002
No.

1158
01:17:51,758 --> 01:17:54,176
Lorraine! Lorraine, what are you doing?

1159
01:17:54,635 --> 01:17:56,970
I swiped it from the old<br/>lady's liquor cabinet.

1160
01:17:57,055 --> 01:17:59,973
Yeah, well, you shouldn't drink.

1161
01:18:00,058 --> 01:18:01,016
Why not?

1162
01:18:01,100 --> 01:18:02,142
Because you...

1163
01:18:02,894 --> 01:18:05,645
You might regret it later in life.

1164
01:18:06,689 --> 01:18:08,607
Marty, don't be such a square.

1165
01:18:08,691 --> 01:18:10,609
Everybody who's anybody drinks.

1166
01:18:15,782 --> 01:18:17,616
Jeez, you smoke, too?

1167
01:18:18,993 --> 01:18:21,995
Marty, you're beginning to<br/>sound just like my mother.

1168
01:18:33,216 --> 01:18:34,549
We're going to take a little break,

1169
01:18:34,634 --> 01:18:36,134
but we'll be back in a while,

1170
01:18:36,219 --> 01:18:38,804
so don't nobody go nowhere.

1171
01:18:55,196 --> 01:18:58,490
Marty? Why are you so nervous?

1172
01:18:59,742 --> 01:19:01,118
Lorraine.

1173
01:19:02,036 --> 01:19:06,206
Have you ever been in a situation

1174
01:19:06,290 --> 01:19:08,083
where you knew you had<br/>to act a certain way,

1175
01:19:08,167 --> 01:19:10,335
but when you got there, you didn't know

1176
01:19:10,420 --> 01:19:12,170
if you could go through with it?

1177
01:19:12,255 --> 01:19:15,715
You mean like how you're<br/>supposed to act on a first date?

1178
01:19:15,800 --> 01:19:17,050
Sort of.

1179
01:19:17,844 --> 01:19:20,512
I think I know exactly what you mean.

1180
01:19:21,347 --> 01:19:22,639
You do?

1181
01:19:23,141 --> 01:19:25,767
You know what I do in those situations?

1182
01:19:25,852 --> 01:19:26,977
What?

1183
01:19:27,061 --> 01:19:28,103
I don't worry.

1184
01:19:46,122 --> 01:19:49,749
This is all wrong. I<br/>don't know what it is.

1185
01:19:51,419 --> 01:19:54,880
But when I kiss you,<br/>it's like I'm kissing

1186
01:19:56,674 --> 01:19:58,049
my brother.

1187
01:19:58,342 --> 01:20:01,052
I guess that doesn't<br/>make any sense, does it?

1188
01:20:01,137 --> 01:20:05,140
Believe me, it makes perfect sense.

1189
01:20:06,976 --> 01:20:08,685
Somebody's coming.

1190
01:20:12,607 --> 01:20:16,818
You caused 300 bucks damage<br/>to my car, you son of a bitch.

1191
01:20:16,903 --> 01:20:20,197
And I'm going to take it<br/>out of your ass. Hold him.

1192
01:20:21,115 --> 01:20:23,533
Let him go, Biff. You're drunk.

1193
01:20:24,368 --> 01:20:26,828
Well, look-ey what we have here.

1194
01:20:29,624 --> 01:20:33,251
No, no! You're staying right<br/>here with me. Come on, Lorraine.

1195
01:20:33,336 --> 01:20:34,377
Let me go!

1196
01:20:34,462 --> 01:20:35,712
Leave her alone, you bastard!

1197
01:20:35,796 --> 01:20:37,631
Take him in back, all<br/>right? I'll be right there.

1198
01:20:37,715 --> 01:20:40,800
Just admit that<br/>you want it. Come on.

1199
01:20:40,885 --> 01:20:43,178
Well, go on. This ain't no peep show.

1200
01:20:49,936 --> 01:20:51,061
Hey, let's put him in there.

1201
01:20:51,145 --> 01:20:52,521
Yeah!

1202
01:20:53,940 --> 01:20:56,274
That's for messing up my hair.

1203
01:20:56,359 --> 01:20:58,443
What the hell are you doing to my car?

1204
01:20:58,528 --> 01:21:00,987
Hey, beat it, spook.<br/>This don't concern you.

1205
01:21:03,574 --> 01:21:06,159
Who you calling "spook," peckerwood?

1206
01:21:07,620 --> 01:21:09,287
Hey, hey, listen, guys...

1207
01:21:09,372 --> 01:21:11,957
Look, I don't want to mess<br/>with no reefer addicts, okay?

1208
01:21:12,041 --> 01:21:13,875
Get home to your mama, boy.

1209
01:21:13,960 --> 01:21:15,043
Biff!

1210
01:21:15,127 --> 01:21:16,211
Hurry, Biff!

1211
01:21:16,754 --> 01:21:18,588
Let me out of here!

1212
01:21:20,383 --> 01:21:21,883
Reginald, where are your keys?

1213
01:21:21,968 --> 01:21:24,135
The keys are in the trunk.

1214
01:21:24,595 --> 01:21:25,720
Say that again?

1215
01:21:25,805 --> 01:21:27,639
I said, the keys are in here.

1216
01:21:41,362 --> 01:21:42,654
Come on!

1217
01:21:44,740 --> 01:21:47,492
Hey, you, get your damn hands off...

1218
01:21:49,245 --> 01:21:50,620
Oh.

1219
01:21:50,705 --> 01:21:53,331
I think you got the wrong car, McFly.

1220
01:21:54,625 --> 01:21:56,668
George, help me! Please!

1221
01:21:56,752 --> 01:21:59,629
Just turn around, McFly, and walk away.

1222
01:22:00,673 --> 01:22:01,673
Please, George.

1223
01:22:01,757 --> 01:22:02,841
Are you deaf, McFly?

1224
01:22:02,925 --> 01:22:05,010
Close the door and beat it.

1225
01:22:07,597 --> 01:22:11,182
No, Biff. You leave her alone.

1226
01:22:11,934 --> 01:22:13,727
All right, McFly.

1227
01:22:16,981 --> 01:22:20,609
You're asking for it, and<br/>now you're going to get it.

1228
01:22:22,028 --> 01:22:23,486
Biff, stop it!

1229
01:22:24,530 --> 01:22:26,781
Biff, you'll break his arm!

1230
01:22:28,284 --> 01:22:29,534
Biff, no!

1231
01:22:30,369 --> 01:22:32,662
Give me a hand here, Reginald.

1232
01:22:33,998 --> 01:22:36,291
Damn it, man! I sliced my hand!

1233
01:22:36,375 --> 01:22:37,834
Whose are these? Mine.

1234
01:22:37,918 --> 01:22:39,836
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

1235
01:22:41,172 --> 01:22:43,048
You're going to break his arm!

1236
01:22:43,716 --> 01:22:46,843
Biff! Biff, leave him alone!

1237
01:22:45,927 --> 01:22:48,387
Let him go! Let him go!

1238
01:23:21,546 --> 01:23:23,130
Are you okay?

1239
01:23:43,193 --> 01:23:45,528
Who is that guy?

1240
01:23:45,612 --> 01:23:46,821
That's George McFly.

1241
01:23:50,659 --> 01:23:52,702
That's George McFly?

1242
01:23:52,786 --> 01:23:54,078
Excuse me.

1243
01:24:05,340 --> 01:24:06,841
The storm.

1244
01:24:08,802 --> 01:24:11,512
Hey, guys, you gotta get back<br/>in there and finish the dance.

1245
01:24:11,596 --> 01:24:13,013
Hey, man. Look at Marvin's hand.

1246
01:24:13,098 --> 01:24:14,223
He can't play with his hand like that,

1247
01:24:14,307 --> 01:24:15,433
and we can't play without him.

1248
01:24:15,517 --> 01:24:17,977
Yeah, well. Look,<br/>Marvin, you got to play.

1249
01:24:18,061 --> 01:24:20,229
See, that's where they kiss for<br/>the first time on the dance floor.

1250
01:24:20,313 --> 01:24:22,022
And if there's no<br/>music, they can't dance.

1251
01:24:22,107 --> 01:24:23,399
If they can't dance, they can't kiss.

1252
01:24:23,483 --> 01:24:25,860
If they can't kiss, they can't<br/>fall in love and I'm history.

1253
01:24:25,944 --> 01:24:27,111
Hey, man, the dance is over

1254
01:24:27,195 --> 01:24:29,739
unless you know somebody<br/>else that can play the guitar.

1255
01:24:37,122 --> 01:24:39,540
This is for all you lovers out there.

1256
01:24:42,127 --> 01:24:46,172
Earth angel, Earth angel

1257
01:24:46,923 --> 01:24:49,550
Will you be mine?

1258
01:24:50,135 --> 01:24:52,803
My darling dear

1259
01:24:53,597 --> 01:24:55,431
George, aren't you going to kiss me?

1260
01:24:55,515 --> 01:24:57,016
I don't know.

1261
01:24:58,810 --> 01:25:00,936
Scram, McFly. I'm cutting in.

1262
01:25:07,944 --> 01:25:11,906
Earth angel, Earth angel

1263
01:25:12,574 --> 01:25:14,408
The one I adore

1264
01:25:14,493 --> 01:25:16,494
Hey, boy, you all right?

1265
01:25:17,621 --> 01:25:19,079
I can't play.

1266
01:25:19,164 --> 01:25:20,247
George!

1267
01:25:37,724 --> 01:25:38,974
George!

1268
01:25:40,393 --> 01:25:41,560
George.

1269
01:25:44,606 --> 01:25:46,023
Excuse me.

1270
01:25:55,450 --> 01:25:58,077
The vision of your happiness

1271
01:26:00,247 --> 01:26:03,457
Earth angel, Earth angel

1272
01:26:04,125 --> 01:26:07,336
Please be mine

1273
01:26:07,921 --> 01:26:10,047
My darling dear

1274
01:26:10,382 --> 01:26:13,425
Love you for all time

1275
01:26:14,219 --> 01:26:17,471
I'm just a fool

1276
01:26:18,557 --> 01:26:21,600
A fool in love

1277
01:26:22,853 --> 01:26:26,272
with you

1278
01:26:33,113 --> 01:26:37,032
Yeah, man, that was good.<br/>Let's do another one.

1279
01:26:37,117 --> 01:26:39,034
No. I got to go.

1280
01:26:39,119 --> 01:26:42,621
Come on, man. Let's do<br/>something that really cooks.

1281
01:26:42,706 --> 01:26:45,499
Something that cooks.

1282
01:26:50,881 --> 01:26:51,922
All right.

1283
01:26:52,007 --> 01:26:53,007
All right!

1284
01:26:57,012 --> 01:26:58,387
All right.

1285
01:26:59,306 --> 01:27:02,725
All right, this is an oldie, but...

1286
01:27:04,728 --> 01:27:08,105
Well, it's an oldie where I come from.

1287
01:27:10,150 --> 01:27:12,401
All right, guys, listen,<br/>this is a blues riff in B.

1288
01:27:12,485 --> 01:27:15,529
Watch me for the changes,<br/>and try and keep up, okay?

1289
01:27:32,464 --> 01:27:35,299
Way down in<br/>Louisiana Down in New Orleans

1290
01:27:35,383 --> 01:27:38,135
Way back up in the woods<br/>among the evergreens

1291
01:27:38,261 --> 01:27:41,055
There stood a log cabin<br/>made of earth and wood

1292
01:27:41,181 --> 01:27:43,766
Where lived a country boy<br/>name of Johnny B. Goode

1293
01:27:44,100 --> 01:27:46,518
He never ever learned<br/>to read or write so well

1294
01:27:46,770 --> 01:27:49,188
He could play the guitar<br/>just like he's ringing a bell

1295
01:27:49,314 --> 01:27:53,275
Go, go Go, Johnny, go, go

1296
01:27:53,860 --> 01:27:55,861
Go, Johnny, go, go, go

1297
01:27:56,738 --> 01:27:58,280
Go, Johnny, go, go

1298
01:27:58,365 --> 01:28:00,991
Hey, George, I heard you<br/>laid out Biff. Nice going.

1299
01:28:01,076 --> 01:28:03,369
George, you ever think of<br/>running for class president?

1300
01:28:03,453 --> 01:28:05,871
Johnny B. Goode

1301
01:28:08,208 --> 01:28:10,876
Go, Johnny, go, go

1302
01:28:10,961 --> 01:28:13,629
Go, Johnny, go, go, go

1303
01:28:13,713 --> 01:28:16,465
Go, Johnny, go, go

1304
01:28:16,549 --> 01:28:18,759
Go, Johnny, go, go, go

1305
01:28:20,345 --> 01:28:22,221
Johnny B. Goode

1306
01:28:24,474 --> 01:28:27,309
Chuck! Chuck, it's Marvin.

1307
01:28:27,394 --> 01:28:29,979
Your cousin, Marvin Berry.

1308
01:28:30,063 --> 01:28:32,815
You know that new sound<br/>you're looking for?

1309
01:28:32,899 --> 01:28:34,775
Well, listen to this.

1310
01:29:44,345 --> 01:29:47,306
I guess you guys aren't<br/>ready for that yet.

1311
01:29:48,641 --> 01:29:50,267
But your kids are going to love it.

1312
01:29:54,522 --> 01:29:55,898
Lorraine.

1313
01:29:55,982 --> 01:29:58,567
Marty, that was very interesting music.

1314
01:29:58,651 --> 01:30:00,235
Yeah.

1315
01:30:00,779 --> 01:30:02,237
I hope you don't mind,

1316
01:30:02,322 --> 01:30:04,364
but George asked if<br/>he could take me home.

1317
01:30:04,616 --> 01:30:07,534
Great! Good. Good, Lorraine.

1318
01:30:07,619 --> 01:30:09,036
I had a feeling about you two.

1319
01:30:09,496 --> 01:30:11,455
I have a feeling, too.

1320
01:30:11,831 --> 01:30:13,207
Listen, I got to go,

1321
01:30:13,291 --> 01:30:18,003
but I wanted to tell you<br/>that it's been educational.

1322
01:30:19,047 --> 01:30:21,507
Marty, will we ever see you again?

1323
01:30:22,717 --> 01:30:23,926
I guarantee it.

1324
01:30:24,010 --> 01:30:27,429
Well, Marty, I want to thank<br/>you for all your good advice.

1325
01:30:27,514 --> 01:30:29,848
I'll never forget it.

1326
01:30:30,558 --> 01:30:32,142
Right, George.

1327
01:30:33,520 --> 01:30:37,022
Well, good luck, you guys.

1328
01:30:38,608 --> 01:30:39,691
Oh!

1329
01:30:41,027 --> 01:30:44,947
One other thing. If<br/>you guys ever have kids,

1330
01:30:45,031 --> 01:30:47,449
and one of them, when<br/>he's eight years old,

1331
01:30:47,534 --> 01:30:50,536
accidentally sets fire<br/>to the living room rug,

1332
01:30:51,871 --> 01:30:53,497
go easy on him.

1333
01:30:54,499 --> 01:30:55,791
Okay.

1334
01:31:00,672 --> 01:31:03,507
Marty. Such a nice name.

1335
01:31:09,472 --> 01:31:11,598
Damn! Where is that kid?

1336
01:31:14,811 --> 01:31:16,061
Damn!

1337
01:31:18,523 --> 01:31:19,898
Damn! Damn!

1338
01:31:27,740 --> 01:31:30,617
You're late! Do you<br/>have no concept of time?

1339
01:31:30,702 --> 01:31:33,078
Hey, come on. I had to change.

1340
01:31:33,163 --> 01:31:36,081
Do you think I'm going<br/>back in that zoot suit?

1341
01:31:36,166 --> 01:31:38,834
The old man really<br/>came through. It worked.

1342
01:31:38,918 --> 01:31:41,003
He laid out Biff in one punch.

1343
01:31:41,087 --> 01:31:42,171
I didn't know he had it in him.

1344
01:31:42,255 --> 01:31:45,465
He's never stood up to Biff in his life.

1345
01:31:46,843 --> 01:31:48,010
Never?

1346
01:31:48,094 --> 01:31:49,845
No. Why? What's the matter?

1347
01:31:50,930 --> 01:31:54,641
All right! Let's set<br/>your destination time.

1348
01:31:59,397 --> 01:32:01,732
This is the exact time you left.

1349
01:32:02,108 --> 01:32:05,569
Let's send you back at<br/>exactly the same time.

1350
01:32:08,448 --> 01:32:10,657
It'll be like you never left.

1351
01:32:12,410 --> 01:32:16,830
Now, I painted a white line<br/>on the street way over there.

1352
01:32:16,915 --> 01:32:18,790
That's where you'll start from.

1353
01:32:18,875 --> 01:32:21,210
I've calculated the precise distance,

1354
01:32:21,294 --> 01:32:23,962
taking into account<br/>the acceleration speed

1355
01:32:24,047 --> 01:32:25,797
and wind resistance retroactive

1356
01:32:25,882 --> 01:32:28,508
from the moment the lightning strikes,

1357
01:32:28,593 --> 01:32:33,096
which will be in exactly<br/>7 minutes and 22 seconds.

1358
01:32:33,473 --> 01:32:35,849
When this alarm goes<br/>off, you hit the gas.

1359
01:32:35,934 --> 01:32:37,017
Right.

1360
01:32:43,816 --> 01:32:46,860
Well, I guess that's everything.

1361
01:32:51,074 --> 01:32:52,532
Thanks.

1362
01:32:52,617 --> 01:32:53,825
Thank you.

1363
01:32:58,831 --> 01:33:00,958
See you in about 30 years.

1364
01:33:02,669 --> 01:33:04,002
I hope so.

1365
01:33:05,672 --> 01:33:07,214
Don't worry!

1366
01:33:07,882 --> 01:33:09,591
As long as you hit that wire

1367
01:33:09,676 --> 01:33:12,761
with the connecting hook at<br/>precisely 88 miles an hour,

1368
01:33:12,845 --> 01:33:15,847
the instant the lightning<br/>strikes the tower

1369
01:33:18,309 --> 01:33:19,434
everything will be fine.

1370
01:33:19,519 --> 01:33:20,686
Right.

1371
01:33:29,570 --> 01:33:31,530
What's the meaning of this?

1372
01:33:31,614 --> 01:33:33,282
You'll find out in 30 years.

1373
01:33:33,366 --> 01:33:35,450
It's about the future, isn't it?

1374
01:33:35,535 --> 01:33:36,618
It's information about the future.

1375
01:33:36,703 --> 01:33:38,245
Wait a minute.

1376
01:33:38,329 --> 01:33:40,247
I warned you about this, kid.

1377
01:33:40,331 --> 01:33:43,166
The consequences could be disastrous!

1378
01:33:43,251 --> 01:33:45,669
Doc, that's a risk you're<br/>going to have to take.

1379
01:33:45,753 --> 01:33:47,337
Your life depends on it!

1380
01:33:47,422 --> 01:33:48,588
No!

1381
01:33:49,048 --> 01:33:52,384
I refuse to accept the responsibility.

1382
01:33:52,719 --> 01:33:54,678
In that case, I'll<br/>tell you straight out.

1383
01:33:59,434 --> 01:34:00,851
Great Scott!

1384
01:34:08,776 --> 01:34:11,820
You get the cable, I'll<br/>throw the rope down to you.

1385
01:34:11,904 --> 01:34:13,697
Right! I got it!

1386
01:34:47,899 --> 01:34:49,149
Doc!

1387
01:34:56,783 --> 01:34:58,367
Come on, come on. Let's go!

1388
01:34:58,451 --> 01:35:01,119
All right! Take it up!

1389
01:35:04,332 --> 01:35:05,457
Go!

1390
01:35:12,507 --> 01:35:13,507
Doc!

1391
01:35:13,591 --> 01:35:14,633
What?

1392
01:35:14,801 --> 01:35:18,136
I have to tell you about the future.

1393
01:35:18,346 --> 01:35:19,388
What?

1394
01:35:19,472 --> 01:35:22,724
I have to tell you about the future!

1395
01:35:22,809 --> 01:35:24,142
What?

1396
01:35:24,227 --> 01:35:29,064
On the night I go back<br/>in time, you get...

1397
01:35:32,568 --> 01:35:33,819
Doc!

1398
01:35:43,079 --> 01:35:44,287
Go!

1399
01:35:45,164 --> 01:35:46,248
No, Doc!

1400
01:35:46,332 --> 01:35:47,582
Look at the time!

1401
01:35:47,667 --> 01:35:51,670
You've got less than four<br/>minutes. Please, hurry!

1402
01:36:03,266 --> 01:36:04,599
Yeah!

1403
01:36:57,820 --> 01:37:01,114
Damn it, Doc! Why did you<br/>have to tear up that letter?

1404
01:37:01,199 --> 01:37:03,158
If I only had more time.

1405
01:37:06,162 --> 01:37:08,538
Wait a minute. I got<br/>all the time I want.

1406
01:37:08,623 --> 01:37:12,209
I got a time machine. I can<br/>just go back early and warn him.

1407
01:37:12,293 --> 01:37:14,836
Okay. Ten minutes ought to do it.

1408
01:37:16,964 --> 01:37:21,676
Okay. Time circuit's on.<br/>Flux capacitor, fluxing.

1409
01:37:22,136 --> 01:37:24,262
Engine running. All right.

1410
01:37:27,058 --> 01:37:29,100
No. No, no.

1411
01:37:30,645 --> 01:37:32,854
Come on. Not this<br/>time. Come on. Come on.

1412
01:38:43,301 --> 01:38:44,593
Come on.

1413
01:38:46,679 --> 01:38:49,806
Here we go. Here we<br/>go. This time. Come on.

1414
01:38:51,100 --> 01:38:53,977
Please. Please. Come on!

1415
01:40:32,326 --> 01:40:33,702
Doc.

1416
01:42:09,882 --> 01:42:11,966
Crazy drunk driver.

1417
01:42:22,478 --> 01:42:23,895
Whoo!

1418
01:42:27,107 --> 01:42:29,359
All right. Fred.

1419
01:42:30,861 --> 01:42:33,655
You look great. Everything looks great.

1420
01:42:34,907 --> 01:42:38,910
1:24. I still got time. I'm coming, Doc!

1421
01:42:42,581 --> 01:42:47,335
No! No, not again! Come on! Come on!

1422
01:43:01,100 --> 01:43:02,433
Libyans.

1423
01:43:25,082 --> 01:43:26,124
No!

1424
01:43:27,459 --> 01:43:28,960
You bastard!

1425
01:43:42,308 --> 01:43:43,641
Go!

1426
01:44:18,010 --> 01:44:20,136
Doc! Doc!

1427
01:44:25,601 --> 01:44:27,769
No! No!

1428
01:44:42,701 --> 01:44:44,202
You're alive.

1429
01:44:53,420 --> 01:44:55,046
Bulletproof vest?

1430
01:44:56,382 --> 01:44:58,049
How did you know?

1431
01:44:58,842 --> 01:45:01,260
I never got a chance to tell you.

1432
01:45:14,817 --> 01:45:18,861
What about all that talk about<br/>screwing up future events?

1433
01:45:18,946 --> 01:45:21,030
The space-time continuum?

1434
01:45:21,490 --> 01:45:24,409
Well, I figured, what the hell?

1435
01:45:34,628 --> 01:45:36,587
So, how far ahead are you going?

1436
01:45:36,672 --> 01:45:39,674
About 30 years. It's<br/>a nice, round number.

1437
01:45:39,758 --> 01:45:44,220
Look me up when you get there,<br/>all right? Guess I'll be about 47.

1438
01:45:44,304 --> 01:45:45,555
I will.

1439
01:45:45,973 --> 01:45:47,390
Take care.

1440
01:45:48,142 --> 01:45:49,350
You, too.

1441
01:45:49,435 --> 01:45:51,769
Right. Bye-bye, Einie.

1442
01:45:52,271 --> 01:45:55,273
Oh. And watch that re-entry.<br/>It's a little bumpy.

1443
01:45:55,983 --> 01:45:57,275
You bet.

1444
01:47:02,257 --> 01:47:03,883
What a nightmare.

1445
01:47:15,229 --> 01:47:18,189
If Paul calls me, tell him I'm<br/>working at the boutique late tonight.

1446
01:47:18,273 --> 01:47:20,358
Linda, first of all,<br/>I'm not your answering service,

1447
01:47:20,442 --> 01:47:21,984
second of all, somebody named Greg

1448
01:47:22,069 --> 01:47:23,945
or Craig called you<br/>just a little while ago.

1449
01:47:24,029 --> 01:47:25,613
Well, which one was it, Greg or Craig?

1450
01:47:25,697 --> 01:47:28,407
I don't know! I can't keep up<br/>with all of your boyfriends.

1451
01:47:28,492 --> 01:47:29,617
Hey.

1452
01:47:30,661 --> 01:47:32,370
What the hell is this?

1453
01:47:33,122 --> 01:47:34,205
Breakfast.

1454
01:47:34,706 --> 01:47:37,125
Did you sleep in your<br/>clothes again last night?

1455
01:47:37,209 --> 01:47:38,543
Yeah. I...

1456
01:47:39,545 --> 01:47:42,088
Yeah. What are you wearing, Dave?

1457
01:47:42,381 --> 01:47:45,216
Marty, I always wear<br/>a suit to the office.

1458
01:47:46,927 --> 01:47:48,761
You all right? Yeah.

1459
01:47:49,555 --> 01:47:50,638
I think we<br/>need a rematch, George.

1460
01:47:50,722 --> 01:47:51,764
A rematch?

1461
01:47:51,849 --> 01:47:52,890
Why? Were you cheating?

1462
01:47:52,975 --> 01:47:53,975
No.

1463
01:47:54,059 --> 01:47:55,935
Hello. Good morning.

1464
01:47:58,021 --> 01:47:59,522
Mom! Dad!

1465
01:47:59,898 --> 01:48:01,482
Did you hit your head?<br/>Marty, are you all right?

1466
01:48:01,567 --> 01:48:05,570
You guys look great.<br/>Mom, you look so thin.

1467
01:48:05,904 --> 01:48:08,447
Why, thank you, Marty. George!

1468
01:48:09,908 --> 01:48:11,993
Good morning, sleepyhead.

1469
01:48:12,911 --> 01:48:14,287
Good morning, Dave. Linda.

1470
01:48:14,371 --> 01:48:15,746
Good morning, Mom.

1471
01:48:15,831 --> 01:48:18,332
Marty, I almost<br/>forgot. Jennifer Parker called.

1472
01:48:18,417 --> 01:48:22,044
I sure like her, Marty.<br/>She is such a sweet girl.

1473
01:48:22,588 --> 01:48:24,589
Isn't tonight the night of the big date?

1474
01:48:24,673 --> 01:48:26,632
What? What, Ma?

1475
01:48:26,717 --> 01:48:28,092
Aren't you going up to the lake tonight?

1476
01:48:28,177 --> 01:48:30,845
You've been planning it for two weeks.

1477
01:48:30,929 --> 01:48:33,598
Mom, we talked about this.<br/>How can I go to the lake?

1478
01:48:33,682 --> 01:48:34,807
The car's wrecked.

1479
01:48:34,892 --> 01:48:36,475
Wrecked? Wrecked?

1480
01:48:36,560 --> 01:48:37,685
When did this happen? Why wasn't I told?

1481
01:48:37,769 --> 01:48:38,769
Quiet down.

1482
01:48:38,854 --> 01:48:40,354
I'm sure the car is fine.

1483
01:48:40,439 --> 01:48:42,690
Why am I always the last<br/>one to know about these things?

1484
01:48:42,774 --> 01:48:45,860
See? There's Biff out<br/>there waxing it right now.

1485
01:48:46,278 --> 01:48:47,695
Now, Biff, I want to make sure that

1486
01:48:47,779 --> 01:48:50,615
we get two coats of wax<br/>this time, not just one.

1487
01:48:50,699 --> 01:48:52,283
I'm just finishing up<br/>the second coat now.

1488
01:48:52,367 --> 01:48:54,952
Now, Biff, don't con me.

1489
01:48:56,455 --> 01:48:58,497
I'm sorry, Mr. McFly.

1490
01:48:58,582 --> 01:49:01,667
I meant I was just<br/>starting on the second coat.

1491
01:49:02,753 --> 01:49:06,589
Biff. What a character. Always<br/>trying to get away with something.

1492
01:49:07,090 --> 01:49:10,051
I've had to stay on top of<br/>Biff ever since high school.

1493
01:49:10,135 --> 01:49:12,220
Although, if it wasn't for him...

1494
01:49:12,304 --> 01:49:13,888
We never would have fallen in love.

1495
01:49:13,972 --> 01:49:15,431
That's right.

1496
01:49:15,974 --> 01:49:18,684
Mr. McFly! Mr. McFly, this just arrived.

1497
01:49:18,769 --> 01:49:21,562
Oh, hi, Marty. I think<br/>it's your new book.

1498
01:49:24,149 --> 01:49:27,985
Honey! Your first novel.

1499
01:49:28,070 --> 01:49:29,111
Like I've always told you,

1500
01:49:29,196 --> 01:49:32,114
you put your mind to it,<br/>you can accomplish anything.

1501
01:49:32,199 --> 01:49:34,700
Oh, Marty, here's your keys.

1502
01:49:34,785 --> 01:49:36,577
You're all waxed up, ready for tonight.

1503
01:49:37,162 --> 01:49:38,329
Keys?

1504
01:49:54,680 --> 01:49:56,305
How about a ride, mister?

1505
01:49:56,390 --> 01:49:57,515
Jennifer.

1506
01:49:58,475 --> 01:50:02,603
Oh, are you a sight for sore<br/>eyes! Let me look at you.

1507
01:50:03,355 --> 01:50:06,232
Marty, you're acting like<br/>you haven't seen me in a week.

1508
01:50:06,316 --> 01:50:07,733
I haven't.

1509
01:50:08,318 --> 01:50:11,570
You okay? Is everything all right?

1510
01:50:14,866 --> 01:50:15,992
Oh, yeah.

1511
01:50:18,203 --> 01:50:19,996
Everything is great.

1512
01:50:34,219 --> 01:50:38,472
Marty! You've got to come back with me!

1513
01:50:39,266 --> 01:50:40,474
Where?

1514
01:50:40,559 --> 01:50:41,726
Back to the future.

1515
01:50:46,356 --> 01:50:48,482
Wait a minute. What are you doing, Doc?

1516
01:50:49,484 --> 01:50:50,568
I need fuel.

1517
01:50:54,031 --> 01:50:56,449
Go ahead. Quick! Get in the car.

1518
01:50:56,533 --> 01:50:58,576
No, no. Doc, I just got here, okay?

1519
01:50:58,660 --> 01:51:00,661
Jennifer's here. We're gonna<br/>take the new truck for a spin.

1520
01:51:00,746 --> 01:51:03,998
Well, bring her along.<br/>This concerns her, too.

1521
01:51:04,082 --> 01:51:05,666
Wait a minute, Doc. What<br/>are you talking about?

1522
01:51:05,751 --> 01:51:07,793
What happens to us in the future?

1523
01:51:07,878 --> 01:51:09,628
Do we become assholes or something?

1524
01:51:09,713 --> 01:51:10,838
No, no, no, no, Marty.

1525
01:51:10,922 --> 01:51:12,673
Both you and Jennifer turn out fine.

1526
01:51:12,758 --> 01:51:14,216
It's your kids, Marty.

1527
01:51:14,301 --> 01:51:16,552
Something has got to<br/>be done about your kids.

1528
01:51:22,934 --> 01:51:26,020
Hey, Doc, we better back up. We don't<br/>have enough road to get up to 88.

1529
01:51:26,104 --> 01:51:30,274
Roads? Where we're going,<br/>we don't need roads.
