671
00:43:49,302 --> 00:43:53,091
You've always been so kind to me. Always.

672
00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:56,881
From when I was quite a little girl.

673
00:43:56,975 --> 00:43:58,431
Why is that?

674
00:43:59,394 --> 00:44:01,761
Even a butler has his favorites, my lady.

675
00:44:02,898 --> 00:44:04,104
Does he?

676
00:44:04,983 --> 00:44:06,565
I'm glad.

677
00:44:06,651 --> 00:44:08,312
ANNA: Lady Mary.

678
00:44:11,156 --> 00:44:12,487
Oh, my lady, I thought...

679
00:44:12,616 --> 00:44:14,032
Carson and I were just making sure

680
00:44:14,116 --> 00:44:16,983
that everything was ship-shape
and Bristol fashion.

681
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:18,484
And it is.

682
00:44:25,169 --> 00:44:26,330
Good night, Carson.

683
00:44:27,171 --> 00:44:28,832
Good night, my lady.

684
00:44:38,098 --> 00:44:41,011
Of all the men on earth.
I mean, he looked so fit.

685
00:44:41,101 --> 00:44:44,685
Dr. Clarkson said it was a heart attack.
Did you see any signs?

686
00:44:44,771 --> 00:44:47,512
Didn't have much of a chance
to study the gentleman.

687
00:44:48,315 --> 00:44:51,273
You don't suppose there's anything
sinister in it, do you?

688
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:53,772
Every day the papers warn us
of German spies

689
00:44:53,862 --> 00:44:57,355
and they did say his presence
was essential for peace in Albania.

690
00:44:57,491 --> 00:44:58,947
I doubt it, my lord.

691
00:44:59,034 --> 00:45:02,120
Anyone wanting to poison his food
would have to get pass Mrs. Patmore.

692
00:45:02,204 --> 00:45:04,114
[CHUCKLES] Blimey, that's a thought.

693
00:45:04,872 --> 00:45:06,707
Unless, of course, she's a spy herself.

[EXCLAIMS IN PAIN]

695
00:45:10,878 --> 00:45:15,543
I wish you'd tell me what's wrong, Bates.
You'll be in no trouble. I only want to help.

696
00:45:15,675 --> 00:45:16,800
I know that, your lordship.

697
00:45:16,884 --> 00:45:20,218
And I am grateful, truly,
but there is nothing I need help with.

698
00:45:26,059 --> 00:45:28,721
-Good morning, Mrs. Hughes.
-Good morning, my lord.

699
00:45:28,854 --> 00:45:30,561
I wonder if you...

[MRS HUGHES SIGHS]

703
00:45:41,991 --> 00:45:46,155
Now will you kindly explain
what in heaven is going on?

704
00:45:46,245 --> 00:45:47,906
I'm perfectly well, Mrs. Hughes.

705
00:45:47,997 --> 00:45:49,988
Bit stiff, that's all.

706
00:45:53,085 --> 00:45:56,998
Just so long as you know,
I'm not leaving until you tell me.

[SIGHS]

708
00:46:11,101 --> 00:46:13,593
I hope you have a strong stomach.

709
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:29,441
Oh, my god!

710
00:46:37,919 --> 00:46:39,284
Cousin Mary?

711
00:46:40,796 --> 00:46:42,252
Hello.

712
00:46:42,798 --> 00:46:43,848
Are we expecting you?

713
00:46:44,383 --> 00:46:48,626
No, but I wanted to see you.
I looked for you yesterday at church.

714
00:46:49,804 --> 00:46:52,045
I wasn't feeling up to it.

715
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:53,801
None of us were.

716
00:46:54,893 --> 00:46:57,476
Must have been a horrible shock.

717
00:46:57,562 --> 00:46:58,723
Yes.

718
00:46:59,481 --> 00:47:00,881
And he seemed a nice fellow.

719
00:47:02,483 --> 00:47:03,814
He was.

720
00:47:04,902 --> 00:47:06,643
A very nice fellow.

721
00:47:08,113 --> 00:47:12,232
So, if there's anything
I can do, please ask.

722
00:47:14,578 --> 00:47:15,989
There isn't.

723
00:47:17,081 --> 00:47:18,445
But thank you.

724
00:47:30,009 --> 00:47:33,092
[SIGHS] Well, here goes.

725
00:47:34,472 --> 00:47:37,964
Do you not think
we ought to say a few words?

726
00:47:38,850 --> 00:47:40,841
What? Good riddance?

727
00:47:40,978 --> 00:47:43,265
That and your promise.

728
00:47:45,649 --> 00:47:47,185
Very well.

729
00:47:47,276 --> 00:47:50,359
I promise I will never
again try to cure myself.

730
00:47:52,029 --> 00:47:54,615
I will spend my life happily
as the butt of others' jokes

731
00:47:54,699 --> 00:47:56,049
and I will never mind them.

We all carry scars,
Mr. Bates, inside or out.

You're no different to the rest of us,
remember that.

734
00:48:03,416 --> 00:48:04,998
I will try to.

735
00:48:05,584 --> 00:48:07,370
That I do promise.

736
00:48:13,258 --> 00:48:15,374
MRS HUGHES: Good riddance!

737
00:48:17,929 --> 00:48:21,672
-So he definitely went in?
-I saw him walk through the door.

738
00:48:21,766 --> 00:48:24,266
But you don't know if he went back
to his own room?

739
00:48:24,519 --> 00:48:26,978
Yes, I do, 'cause I was the one
who found him there the next day.

740
00:48:27,062 --> 00:48:31,101
What I mean is, you don't know
if he went back under his own steam.

741
00:48:31,233 --> 00:48:33,895
I suppose not,
but how else would he have done it?

742
00:48:34,028 --> 00:48:36,770
That's what they call the big question.

00:48:40,242 --> 00:48:42,983
I don't want to get in
any trouble over this.

Don't worry, you won't.
