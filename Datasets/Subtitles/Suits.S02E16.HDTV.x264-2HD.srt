1
00:00:00,062 --> 00:00:01,162
Previously on... <i>Suits.</i>

2
00:00:01,163 --> 00:00:03,320
Less than
1 out of every 12 people

3
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:04,520
who applies gets in.

4
00:00:04,522 --> 00:00:05,955
What if I'm not one
of those people?

5
00:00:05,957 --> 00:00:08,524
I don't know. Maybe you'll
get in somewhere else.

6
00:00:08,526 --> 00:00:09,926
I don't want to go
to law school.

7
00:00:09,928 --> 00:00:11,093
I want to go to Harvard.

8
00:00:11,095 --> 00:00:15,031
I got 100% faith in you.

9
00:00:15,033 --> 00:00:17,199
[Softly] I didn't get in.

10
00:00:17,201 --> 00:00:18,401
I promised her.

11
00:00:18,403 --> 00:00:20,803
Louis, I liked her.

12
00:00:20,805 --> 00:00:23,005
You're just going to have
to tell her the truth.

13
00:00:23,007 --> 00:00:25,541
Sometimes good
isn't good enough.

14
00:00:25,543 --> 00:00:29,111
I want my name on the door.

15
00:00:29,113 --> 00:00:31,047
So if you deliver a huge win...

16
00:00:31,049 --> 00:00:33,382
I get my name on the door.

17
00:00:33,384 --> 00:00:35,185
Are you talking
about joining forces with her?

18
00:00:35,186 --> 00:00:38,154
Not just with her,
with her firm...

19
00:00:38,156 --> 00:00:41,090
her infinitely
deep-pocketed firm.

20
00:00:41,092 --> 00:00:42,091
Edward and I are merging.

21
00:00:42,093 --> 00:00:43,259
I had to show him the books.

22
00:00:43,261 --> 00:00:44,727
You don't want your name
on the door.

23
00:00:44,729 --> 00:00:46,228
You want your name on my door.

24
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:48,698
I want to see our names
on the same door.

25
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:50,366
This is exactly
what you've always wanted.

26
00:00:50,368 --> 00:00:51,467
Get over your pride.

27
00:00:51,469 --> 00:00:54,003
I'm not getting over anything.

28
00:00:54,005 --> 00:00:57,640
And this merger
isn't happening.

29
00:00:57,642 --> 00:01:00,309
- Those are your clients.
- Who Harvey is using.

30
00:01:00,311 --> 00:01:04,013
- That's a bullshit argument.
- And so is that file.

31
00:01:06,917 --> 00:01:08,150
- I won't.
- You will.

32
00:01:08,152 --> 00:01:09,418
Harvey will never forgive me.

33
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:11,921
Right now your problem
isn't with Harvey.

34
00:01:11,923 --> 00:01:13,923
Your problem is with me.

35
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:32,041
Champagne?

36
00:01:32,043 --> 00:01:34,043
- Depends.
- On what?

37
00:01:34,045 --> 00:01:35,745
On whether or not
there's a roofie in there.

38
00:01:35,747 --> 00:01:37,446
I wouldn't need a roofie.

39
00:01:37,448 --> 00:01:39,982
Jessica, uh, might I have
a private word?

40
00:01:39,984 --> 00:01:41,450
Actually, Harvey and I were...

41
00:01:41,452 --> 00:01:42,918
Don't mind me.

42
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,353
My date just got here.

43
00:01:44,355 --> 00:01:46,022
Edward. Harvey.

44
00:01:46,024 --> 00:01:49,458
Hell of a party.

45
00:02:00,604 --> 00:02:01,604
You look...

46
00:02:01,606 --> 00:02:03,005
Beautiful. I know.

47
00:02:03,007 --> 00:02:04,974
Actually, I was going
to say "sophisticated."

48
00:02:04,976 --> 00:02:07,643
- No, you weren't.
- I can now.

49
00:02:11,415 --> 00:02:13,949
You seem different.
I feel different.

50
00:02:13,951 --> 00:02:15,651
What's going on?

51
00:02:15,653 --> 00:02:19,121
You know, why don't you
get me a drink?

52
00:02:19,123 --> 00:02:20,256
It's a party.

53
00:02:20,258 --> 00:02:22,625
Okay.

54
00:02:22,627 --> 00:02:24,360
Harvey.

55
00:02:24,362 --> 00:02:25,795
Rachel.

56
00:02:25,797 --> 00:02:26,996
You look nice.

57
00:02:26,998 --> 00:02:29,131
Thank you. So do I.

58
00:02:29,133 --> 00:02:33,169
Now I see what
you're always talking about.

59
00:02:33,171 --> 00:02:34,670
What was that supposed to mean?

60
00:02:34,672 --> 00:02:36,772
What do you think it means?
It means you're a dick.

61
00:02:36,774 --> 00:02:38,274
Fair point.

62
00:02:38,276 --> 00:02:39,909
I just didn't know
that she knew that.

63
00:02:39,911 --> 00:02:41,077
Everyone knows that.

64
00:02:41,079 --> 00:02:45,715
- You bring it?
- Right here.

65
00:02:45,717 --> 00:02:47,883
You sure you want
to do this to her?

66
00:02:47,885 --> 00:02:49,351
You're supposed to be
on my side.

67
00:02:49,353 --> 00:02:50,920
I am. I've got your back.

68
00:02:50,922 --> 00:02:52,722
Then why are you giving me
such a hard time about it?

69
00:02:52,724 --> 00:02:54,657
Not only am I not giving you
a hard time,

70
00:02:54,659 --> 00:02:57,293
but I am giving you this...

71
00:02:57,295 --> 00:03:01,330
and this and this.

72
00:03:01,332 --> 00:03:04,834
Now, if you'll excuse me...
Where are you going?

73
00:03:04,836 --> 00:03:06,602
Oh, I'm going to go get a drink

74
00:03:06,604 --> 00:03:08,671
while this is still a party.

75
00:03:16,179 --> 00:03:18,180
- Hi, may I...
- Excuse me, good sir.

76
00:03:18,182 --> 00:03:19,715
Would you be so kind
as to prepare me...

77
00:03:19,717 --> 00:03:22,685
A frapin cuvee?
Easy, Prince Charles.

78
00:03:22,687 --> 00:03:24,954
Where I'm from,
you wait your turn in line.

79
00:03:24,956 --> 00:03:26,055
Oh, I'm so sorry,

80
00:03:26,057 --> 00:03:27,590
but I thought
you'd been served.

81
00:03:27,592 --> 00:03:30,159
The barman is patiently
waiting on you,

82
00:03:30,161 --> 00:03:33,362
so I'd stop standing there
like some sort of baboon

83
00:03:33,364 --> 00:03:36,565
and order your Miller Lite.

84
00:03:36,567 --> 00:03:38,134
Macallan 25, neat.

85
00:03:38,136 --> 00:03:40,236
Why don't you put a banana
in it for my man here?

86
00:03:40,238 --> 00:03:42,238
With a drink like that,
you might as well be in a zoo,

87
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,439
playing about in the mud.

88
00:03:43,441 --> 00:03:44,774
Oh, you wouldn't know
anything about mud.

89
00:03:44,776 --> 00:03:46,275
It's not for playing.
It's for cleansing.

90
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:49,224
You mud?

91
00:03:50,782 --> 00:03:52,014
I've taken mud in more places

92
00:03:52,016 --> 00:03:53,716
than your snooty little mind
can fathom.

93
00:03:53,718 --> 00:03:55,151
Calais.

94
00:03:55,153 --> 00:03:56,519
- Cliffs or Harbor?
- Both.

95
00:03:56,521 --> 00:03:57,820
Me too. Sedona.

96
00:03:57,822 --> 00:03:59,555
- Isle of Wight.
- Joshua tree.

97
00:03:59,557 --> 00:04:00,823
- Dalyan.
- Baden-Baden.

98
00:04:00,825 --> 00:04:04,660
That isn't mud. It's wet dirt.

99
00:04:04,662 --> 00:04:06,328
You know, I don't know
who you think you are...

100
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:09,665
My moniker is
Nigel Alexander Nesbitt.

101
00:04:09,667 --> 00:04:12,268
Well, Nigel, when you impugn

102
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:14,570
the life-affirming muds
of Baden-Baden,

103
00:04:14,572 --> 00:04:16,472
you're on the precipice
of the equivalent

104
00:04:16,474 --> 00:04:20,075
of someone taking a shit
on the royal muds of England.

105
00:04:20,077 --> 00:04:21,811
How dare you?

106
00:04:21,813 --> 00:04:23,479
Oh, I've already dared...

107
00:04:23,481 --> 00:04:25,714
To do... What I've done.

108
00:04:34,224 --> 00:04:35,391
Ah, Harvey.

109
00:04:35,393 --> 00:04:37,259
I was hoping we might have
a moment alone.

110
00:04:37,261 --> 00:04:38,394
So was I.

111
00:04:38,396 --> 00:04:41,130
I wanted to run something
by you.

112
00:04:41,132 --> 00:04:44,233
- This is a lawsuit.
- Three lawsuits.

113
00:04:44,235 --> 00:04:46,902
What have I gotten up to now?

114
00:04:46,904 --> 00:04:48,971
Not you, your clients.

115
00:04:48,973 --> 00:04:51,540
Looks like one of their hobbies
is fixing prices.

116
00:04:51,542 --> 00:04:53,175
I take it this means

117
00:04:53,177 --> 00:04:54,677
you've discovered
we're in merger talks?

118
00:04:54,679 --> 00:04:56,245
And what are you going
to do about it?

119
00:04:56,247 --> 00:04:58,514
- What would you have me do?
- I'd have you kiss my ass.

120
00:04:58,516 --> 00:05:00,349
Tempting.

121
00:05:00,351 --> 00:05:03,586
However, what I can do
is enjoy this glass of wine,

122
00:05:03,588 --> 00:05:05,588
finish this lovely party,

123
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:07,489
and proceed to make you
permanently regret

124
00:05:07,491 --> 00:05:09,892
the hostile action
you've just set in motion.

125
00:05:09,894 --> 00:05:12,361
What, are you going to kill me?

126
00:05:12,363 --> 00:05:13,863
Nonsense.

127
00:05:13,865 --> 00:05:16,098
I'll simply do what I've done
to so many before.

128
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:18,067
I'll defeat you in open court.

129
00:05:18,069 --> 00:05:21,737
The way I work, it's never
going to get to open court.

130
00:05:21,739 --> 00:05:23,606
You'll be on your steamer
back to London,

131
00:05:23,608 --> 00:05:25,608
wondering what happened,
and you'll know

132
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:27,276
that you picked a fight
with the wrong guy.

133
00:05:27,278 --> 00:05:30,212
Are you suggesting a wager?

134
00:05:30,214 --> 00:05:33,249
I'm not a gambler,
but in this case,

135
00:05:33,251 --> 00:05:34,516
I'll make an exception.

136
00:05:34,518 --> 00:05:38,721
You lose, we don't merge.

137
00:05:38,723 --> 00:05:40,990
I've heard your terms.
You win, I go.

138
00:05:40,992 --> 00:05:42,258
Care to hear mine?

139
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:43,525
Don't need to

140
00:05:43,527 --> 00:05:46,762
'cause you're never
going to win.

141
00:05:46,764 --> 00:05:49,598
Well, it looks like you two
are getting along.

142
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,600
Mm.

143
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:56,505
Harvey...

144
00:05:56,507 --> 00:05:58,407
Look at what they can give us.

145
00:05:58,409 --> 00:06:00,142
How do you know
what they can give us?

146
00:06:00,144 --> 00:06:01,777
Because he showed me
their books.

147
00:06:01,779 --> 00:06:03,913
- Why did he do that?
- Because I showed him ours.

148
00:06:03,915 --> 00:06:05,214
Why didn't you tell me?

149
00:06:05,216 --> 00:06:07,950
- We needed their help.
- To beat Hardman.

150
00:06:07,952 --> 00:06:09,752
And I didn't want you worrying

151
00:06:09,754 --> 00:06:12,087
that we would owe him
for the rest of our lives.

152
00:06:12,089 --> 00:06:14,757
You don't marry someone
just because they knock you up.

153
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:17,393
All right, Harvey, here it is.

154
00:06:17,395 --> 00:06:18,694
You lose,

155
00:06:18,696 --> 00:06:21,764
you embrace this partnership
with no reservations.

156
00:06:21,766 --> 00:06:23,165
He can beat me,

157
00:06:23,167 --> 00:06:26,502
I'll welcome him
with arms wide open.

158
00:06:26,504 --> 00:06:28,771
He can't,
we send him back to England,

159
00:06:28,773 --> 00:06:30,906
and he can spend his time
fixing his teeth.

160
00:06:30,908 --> 00:06:32,141
Fine.

161
00:06:32,143 --> 00:06:34,410
You beat Edward,
we don't do this.

162
00:06:34,412 --> 00:06:37,046
And since you didn't want
to hear Darby's terms,

163
00:06:37,048 --> 00:06:38,881
these are mine.

164
00:06:38,883 --> 00:06:40,816
You win, you get what you want.

165
00:06:40,818 --> 00:06:42,751
You lose, you stay,

166
00:06:42,753 --> 00:06:44,286
you extend your noncompete,

167
00:06:44,288 --> 00:06:48,724
and you get a chance
to earn your name on the door

168
00:06:48,726 --> 00:06:50,826

going up there now.

00:14:16,855 --> 00:14:18,087
Right now...

354
00:14:18,089 --> 00:14:20,890
Game of efficiency list.

355
00:14:20,892 --> 00:14:23,559
I'm afraid I don't have
my files with me.

356
00:14:23,561 --> 00:14:25,394
Files are for pussies.

357
00:14:25,396 --> 00:14:27,563
Right you are.

358
00:14:27,565 --> 00:14:29,365
I was just trying
to give you a way out.

359
00:14:29,367 --> 00:14:30,733
I looked into you.

360
00:14:30,735 --> 00:14:33,603
And I you, Louis Marlowe Litt.

361
00:14:33,605 --> 00:14:35,438
You, as everyone else
in your firm,

362
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,906
graduated from Harvard Law.

363
00:14:36,908 --> 00:14:38,174
And you, as everyone else
in your firm,

364
00:14:38,176 --> 00:14:40,076
graduated from either
Harvard or Cambridge,

365
00:14:40,078 --> 00:14:41,811
which waters down the purity.

366
00:14:41,813 --> 00:14:43,779
However, I graduated from both.

367
00:14:43,781 --> 00:14:45,748
That's inefficient.

368
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:48,050
[Softly] Not when done
in three years.

369
00:14:48,052 --> 00:14:50,953
[Softly] Well, this isn't
about your efficiency.

370
00:14:50,955 --> 00:14:53,222
This is
about your efficiency list.

371
00:14:53,224 --> 00:14:55,358
[Normal voice]
My list isn't science.

372
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,826
It's a work of art.

373
00:14:56,828 --> 00:15:00,630
Performance reviews
versus projected billables...

374
00:15:00,632 --> 00:15:01,631
child's play.

375
00:15:01,633 --> 00:15:04,300
I ain't no child.

376
00:15:04,302 --> 00:15:05,968
I begin with life expectancy.

377
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:07,236
I begin with nutrition.

378
00:15:07,238 --> 00:15:09,038
How do you think
I determine life expectancy?

379
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,139
Number of sexual partners.

380
00:15:10,141 --> 00:15:12,775
- Relationship to mother.
- Pet ownership.

381
00:15:12,777 --> 00:15:15,511
The three things
are inextricably linked,

382
00:15:15,513 --> 00:15:18,180
and I have the formula
right here.

383
00:15:18,182 --> 00:15:20,750
Yeah, well, I...

384
00:15:20,752 --> 00:15:22,418
Just remembered
that I have a deposition

385
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:24,353
that I have to go to
in conference room "D."

386
00:15:24,355 --> 00:15:26,889
There is
no conference room "D."

387
00:15:26,891 --> 00:15:29,091
They're re-lettering.

388
00:15:35,732 --> 00:15:37,333
Where are you off to
in such a hurry?

389
00:15:37,335 --> 00:15:39,735
Uh, I have to finish
this page-turner.

390
00:15:39,737 --> 00:15:40,836
<i>Harry Potter?</i>

391
00:15:40,838 --> 00:15:43,239
No, but it is
by a British author.

392
00:15:43,241 --> 00:15:45,341
Well, I've got something else
for you to read.

393
00:15:45,343 --> 00:15:46,542
- What?
- A letter.

394
00:15:46,544 --> 00:15:48,044
Oh, sweet.
It's not even my birthday.

395
00:15:48,046 --> 00:15:51,247
It's not to you. It's from you.

396
00:15:54,885 --> 00:15:56,085
This is to Harvard.

397
00:15:56,087 --> 00:15:57,520
I'm going
over Sheila Sazs' head

398
00:15:57,522 --> 00:15:59,455
and telling them
everything that happened.

399
00:15:59,457 --> 00:16:01,223
Well, you are.

400
00:16:01,225 --> 00:16:02,525
- Rachel, you can't...
- No, come on.

401
00:16:02,527 --> 00:16:03,726
You said it yourself.

402
00:16:03,728 --> 00:16:05,528
It is not right
that I'm being denied admission

403
00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:07,029
because someone's
punishing Louis.

404
00:16:07,031 --> 00:16:08,598
It's not,
but I can't sign this.

405
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,901
- Why not?
- Because it's not my place?

406
00:16:11,903 --> 00:16:14,203
- Well, then whose place is it?
- I didn't see what happened.

407
00:16:14,205 --> 00:16:15,538
It's hearsay.

408
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:18,641
Mike, I'm someone
who wants to go to Harvard.

409
00:16:18,643 --> 00:16:20,643
You're someone
who went to Harvard.

410
00:16:20,645 --> 00:16:24,714
Who do you think
they're going to listen to more?

411
00:16:24,716 --> 00:16:28,184
Are you going
to help me or not?

412
00:16:32,022 --> 00:16:34,690
I'll help you.

413
00:16:39,596 --> 00:16:41,364
Whatever it is,
I'm not in the mood.

414
00:16:41,366 --> 00:16:44,367
I know about Rachel
and Sheila and Harvard.

415
00:16:46,203 --> 00:16:47,203
How?

416
00:16:47,205 --> 00:16:48,871
Rachel told me.

417
00:16:48,873 --> 00:16:52,608
She wants me to send this letter
going over Sheila's head,

418
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:55,411
but it can't come from me.

419
00:16:58,548 --> 00:17:00,249
Yeah, it can't come
from anyone.

420
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:06,155
[Sighs]

421
00:17:06,157 --> 00:17:07,456
She didn't get in

422
00:17:07,458 --> 00:17:09,125
because they didn't think
she was good enough.

423
00:17:09,127 --> 00:17:12,028
- You lied to her.
- No, I never lied to her.

424
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:14,330
I told her she was good enough,
which she is,

425
00:17:14,332 --> 00:17:16,399
but I let her down because
I couldn't persuade Sheila,

426
00:17:16,401 --> 00:17:17,633
which is the truth.

427
00:17:17,635 --> 00:17:19,902
Louis, you have to tell her
the real truth.

428
00:17:19,904 --> 00:17:22,405
Mike, I saw the look
on her face,

429
00:17:22,407 --> 00:17:23,572
and I took it away.

430
00:17:23,574 --> 00:17:25,007
I do not want to put it back.

431
00:17:25,009 --> 00:17:26,609
She is going to pursue this.

432
00:17:26,611 --> 00:17:29,178
She's going to find out
one way or the other.

433
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:30,846
I'm not going to let her
find out from Harvard.

434
00:17:30,848 --> 00:17:34,083
I can't tell her.

435
00:17:34,085 --> 00:17:37,319
You'll regret it.

436
00:17:37,321 --> 00:17:38,821
Look, I'll give you another day
to think about it,

437
00:17:38,823 --> 00:17:42,525
but after that,
I have to tell her myself.

438
00:17:42,527 --> 00:17:44,760
[Sighs]

439
00:17:49,633 --> 00:17:51,801
Gentlemen, I'm glad
you stopped by.

440
00:17:51,803 --> 00:17:53,302
I wanted to inform you

441
00:17:53,304 --> 00:17:55,404
I'm leaving town on the morrow.

442
00:17:55,406 --> 00:17:57,940
I'll be having my number two
handle the case for me.

443
00:17:57,942 --> 00:17:59,041
I expect you'll do the same.

444
00:17:59,043 --> 00:18:00,609
Why would I do that?

445
00:18:00,611 --> 00:18:02,712
It's tradition.
I leave it to you.

446
00:18:02,714 --> 00:18:05,514
Honor it or don't.
I say we honor it.

447
00:18:05,516 --> 00:18:08,451
Oh, by the by, <i>Downton Abbey...</i>

448
00:18:08,453 --> 00:18:09,719
got it in my briefcase.

449
00:18:09,721 --> 00:18:11,253
Plan to watch it on the plane.

450
00:18:11,255 --> 00:18:12,688
Oh, my God. You are going to...

451
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:16,826
Please, please.
I abhor spoilers.

452
00:18:16,828 --> 00:18:18,561
Episode three...
that's all I'll say.

453
00:18:18,563 --> 00:18:19,729
Oh.

454
00:18:19,731 --> 00:18:20,730
Why don't you two
watch it together

455
00:18:20,732 --> 00:18:21,997
over a game of Tiddlywinks?

456
00:18:21,999 --> 00:18:24,300
You seem to be upset
over my game

457
00:18:24,302 --> 00:18:26,502
of "let's put the peacock
in its place."

458
00:18:26,504 --> 00:18:27,903
I'm glad you mentioned that.

459
00:18:27,905 --> 00:18:30,973
I brought a little
going-away present for you.

460
00:18:35,212 --> 00:18:37,213
This is a biscuit
and a bottle of water.

461
00:18:37,215 --> 00:18:39,682
It's what I assume
they serve in English prison,

462
00:18:39,684 --> 00:18:41,083
which is
where your client's going

463
00:18:41,085 --> 00:18:43,285
for freezing
our client's assets.

464
00:18:43,287 --> 00:18:45,321
It's a violation
of international law

465
00:18:45,323 --> 00:18:47,223
to intimidate a litigant
into settling

466
00:18:47,225 --> 00:18:50,226
by choking their funding.

467
00:18:52,662 --> 00:18:55,531
You seem to think you've
got me by the short hairs.

468
00:18:55,533 --> 00:18:59,034
However, if you turn
to page 693 in this tome,

469
00:18:59,036 --> 00:19:01,170
you'll find an exception
to that very law.

470
00:19:01,172 --> 00:19:02,505
No, I won't.

471
00:19:02,507 --> 00:19:04,673
I've memorized this book.

472
00:19:04,675 --> 00:19:07,243
Yes, I was told
of your prowess,

473
00:19:07,245 --> 00:19:11,147
which is why I chose a law
not published in any book,

474
00:19:11,149 --> 00:19:15,184
but a long-standing provision
honored in England for decades.

475
00:19:15,186 --> 00:19:18,587
We can do what we like,
as long as notice is given.

476
00:19:18,589 --> 00:19:20,322
You don't give a shit
about being sporting.

477
00:19:20,324 --> 00:19:21,857
You just wanted
to skirt the law.

478
00:19:21,859 --> 00:19:24,693
Nonsense. I wanted to do both.

479
00:19:24,695 --> 00:19:27,029
By filing this action,

480
00:19:27,031 --> 00:19:28,697
you have opened your clients up

481
00:19:28,699 --> 00:19:30,766
to a charge
of malicious litigation.

482
00:19:30,768 --> 00:19:32,134
Which is
why you froze the assets

483
00:19:32,136 --> 00:19:33,135
in the first place.

484
00:19:33,137 --> 00:19:34,970
You baited us.

485
00:19:34,972 --> 00:19:39,308
In any case, you seem to be
backed up against the wall.

486
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:41,243
I'm comfortable there.

487
00:19:41,245 --> 00:19:44,013
Gives me back support
for when I come out swinging.

488
00:19:44,015 --> 00:19:46,715
Well, you'd better
do something quickly.

489
00:19:46,717 --> 00:19:48,450
Your clients
don't have the funds

490
00:19:48,452 --> 00:19:51,387
to proceed beyond, I'd say,
this week's end.

491
00:19:51,389 --> 00:19:54,990
Now, if you'll excuse me...

492
00:19:54,992 --> 00:19:55,991
Hey.

493
00:19:55,993 --> 00:19:57,426
Episode three...

494
00:19:57,428 --> 00:20:01,163
Lady Mary and the Turk do it,
and then the Turk dies.

495
00:20:05,402 --> 00:20:07,269
Sorry.

496
00:20:07,271 --> 00:20:09,738
Jessica, you wanted to see me?

497
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:11,507
I thought you were supposed
to be announced.

498
00:20:11,509 --> 00:20:13,943
You summoned me.
That supersedes an announcement.

499
00:20:13,945 --> 00:20:15,377
How can I help you?

500
00:20:15,379 --> 00:20:17,813
I understand
you're leaving town tomorrow

501
00:20:17,815 --> 00:20:21,050
and putting Dana Scott
in your stead.

502
00:20:21,052 --> 00:20:24,587
Yes, I have some business
to attend to on the coast.

503
00:20:24,589 --> 00:20:28,757
Yes, your business
with Bayne-Powlen in Los Angeles

504
00:20:28,759 --> 00:20:31,327
and Tillson-Tuttle
in San Francisco.

505
00:20:31,329 --> 00:20:32,895
Do you really think

506
00:20:32,897 --> 00:20:34,897
you could take meetings
with other firms

507
00:20:34,899 --> 00:20:36,165
and I wouldn't know?

508
00:20:36,167 --> 00:20:38,634
- Why would I not?
- Because we have a deal.

509
00:20:38,636 --> 00:20:41,470
That deal presupposed
that you could control your man.

510
00:20:41,472 --> 00:20:43,138
I can control him.

511
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:45,140
Then why the hell
did you allow our wager?

512
00:20:45,142 --> 00:20:46,809
For the same damn reason
you made it.

513
00:20:46,811 --> 00:20:50,246
If I can't beat him,
he won't respect me.

514
00:20:50,248 --> 00:20:52,047
And if he doesn't respect you,

515
00:20:52,049 --> 00:20:55,284
he won't respect me,
and he will eventually leave.

516
00:20:55,286 --> 00:20:57,186
And he's too valuable an asset.

517
00:20:57,188 --> 00:20:59,154
I didn't just fall
off a turnip truck.

518
00:20:59,156 --> 00:21:02,024
No, I don't suppose you did.

519
00:21:02,026 --> 00:21:04,059
The truth is,
you're afraid you might lose.

520
00:21:04,061 --> 00:21:05,961
I'm afraid of nothing
of the sort.

521
00:21:05,963 --> 00:21:09,231
Then why are you taking
meetings with other firms?

522
00:21:09,233 --> 00:21:12,134
You gave me your word
on this deal,

523
00:21:12,136 --> 00:21:15,170
so either you're going
to win and break it,

524
00:21:15,172 --> 00:21:17,606
or you're afraid.

525
00:21:17,608 --> 00:21:21,043
I never break my word.

526
00:21:21,045 --> 00:21:24,947
Then there it is.

527
00:21:24,949 --> 00:21:26,248
I'm not afraid,

528
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:28,250
but I didn't get where I am

529
00:21:28,252 --> 00:21:30,085
without taking
some precautions.

530
00:21:30,087 --> 00:21:32,388
Then go ahead and take them.

531
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:33,956
But you're wasting your time

532
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:36,759
because we're not losing
this case.

533
00:21:49,001 --> 00:21:51,169
Hey, can I, uh, talk
to you for a sec?

534
00:21:51,171 --> 00:21:54,606
What is it, Louis?
I'm just a little busy now.

535
00:21:54,608 --> 00:21:56,774
I just wanted to say
that I know you've been taking

536
00:21:56,776 --> 00:21:58,943
a lot of heat
from Jessica, and...

537
00:21:58,945 --> 00:22:00,612
I'm glad you did what you did.

538
00:22:00,614 --> 00:22:02,313
That's not supposed
to be public knowledge.

539
00:22:02,315 --> 00:22:03,414
Well, no, Donna told me

540
00:22:03,416 --> 00:22:07,619
because she knows
that I support you 100%.

541
00:22:07,621 --> 00:22:09,587
Do you?

542
00:22:09,589 --> 00:22:12,457
Nigel Nesbitt...
my British counterpart.

543
00:22:12,459 --> 00:22:13,491
What about him?

544
00:22:13,493 --> 00:22:15,160
He out-mudded me.

545
00:22:15,162 --> 00:22:16,461
Didn't you tell him
about Cartagena?

546
00:22:16,463 --> 00:22:18,296
Oh, would we be having
this conversation if I had?

547
00:22:18,298 --> 00:22:19,464
Louis, relax.

548
00:22:19,466 --> 00:22:20,999
I know how seriously
you take your mudding,

549
00:22:21,001 --> 00:22:22,500
but that's personal.

550
00:22:22,502 --> 00:22:24,369
It doesn't mean
he's a better lawyer.

551
00:22:24,371 --> 00:22:26,437
Yeah, but he didn't
just out-mud me, Harvey.

552
00:22:26,439 --> 00:22:29,040
He out-listed me.
He out-educated me.

553
00:22:29,042 --> 00:22:30,775
He...

554
00:22:30,777 --> 00:22:32,710
out-me'd me.

555
00:22:32,712 --> 00:22:34,445
And if this guy
out-finances me...

556
00:22:34,447 --> 00:22:35,446
I understand.

557
00:22:35,448 --> 00:22:37,849
I mean, but really, do you?

558
00:22:37,851 --> 00:22:39,450
Because I fought tooth and nail

559
00:22:39,452 --> 00:22:41,019
to become one
of 30 senior partners,

560
00:22:41,021 --> 00:22:42,420
and I'm the best at what I do.

561
00:22:42,422 --> 00:22:43,655
But if this merger
goes through,

562
00:22:43,657 --> 00:22:45,023
I'm going to be one of 150,

563
00:22:45,025 --> 00:22:49,027
and I'm not going to be
the best of anything.

564
00:22:49,029 --> 00:22:52,096
Harvey, I'm scared.

565
00:22:52,098 --> 00:22:54,032
Please tell me
we're going to win this thing.

566
00:22:54,034 --> 00:22:56,267
Our backs are against the wall.

567
00:23:00,839 --> 00:23:01,940
What do you need?

568
00:23:01,942 --> 00:23:03,975
Right now I need
to buy some time.

569
00:23:03,977 --> 00:23:07,078
- That's easy.
- What?

570
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,479
You once told me what to do

571
00:23:08,481 --> 00:23:09,981
when your back's
against the wall.

572
00:23:09,983 --> 00:23:12,617
Break the goddamn thing down.

573
00:23:12,619 --> 00:23:14,719
That's right.

574
00:23:14,721 --> 00:23:17,222
- You have access to that shit?
- All of it.

575
00:23:17,224 --> 00:23:19,224
They needed me
to do an efficiency list.

576
00:23:19,226 --> 00:23:21,859
We got 'em.

577
00:23:24,029 --> 00:23:26,397
You're not
Mr. Chong's Chinese food.

578
00:23:26,399 --> 00:23:28,233
Oh, I ran into him
on my way in.

579
00:23:28,235 --> 00:23:29,867
I just sent him away.
Why would you do that?

580
00:23:29,869 --> 00:23:32,537
M.S.G... It's terrible for you.
Plus, I ate it.

581

[Sighs]

582
00:23:33,707 --> 00:23:35,039
What's this?

583
00:23:35,041 --> 00:23:36,307
It's what you're going to use

584
00:23:36,309 --> 00:23:37,609
against Scottie
tomorrow morning.

585
00:23:37,611 --> 00:23:38,676
Me?

586
00:23:38,678 --> 00:23:40,545
You're going in as number two.

587
00:23:40,547 --> 00:23:42,146
I don't want to give Edward
any excuses.

588
00:23:42,148 --> 00:23:43,581
You mean you don't want
to deal with Scottie.

589
00:23:43,583 --> 00:23:45,083
Well, that's just
a side benefit.

590
00:23:45,085 --> 00:23:47,318
Right.

591
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:48,453
Whoa, wait a second.

592
00:23:48,455 --> 00:23:50,888
This is confidential information
from the merger.

593
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:52,724
Which you're going to use
to get us a reprieve.

594
00:23:52,726 --> 00:23:54,058
You broke the Chinese wall?

595
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:55,126
Why do you think I'm here?

596
00:23:55,128 --> 00:23:57,328
Harvey, this is
inadmissible stuff.

597
00:23:57,330 --> 00:23:58,630
And it's in the ballpark

598
00:23:58,632 --> 00:24:00,331
of what Tanner accused you of
with Coastal Motors.

599
00:24:00,333 --> 00:24:03,901
You think I don't know that?

600
00:24:03,903 --> 00:24:05,336
Are you sure
you want to do this?

601
00:24:05,338 --> 00:24:07,872
No, I'm not.

602
00:24:07,874 --> 00:24:10,241
But it's the only way I see us
getting a little breathing room,

603
00:24:10,243 --> 00:24:13,144
and I'd rather cross my own line
than sign their dotted one.

604
00:24:13,146 --> 00:24:14,412
Okay.

605
00:24:14,414 --> 00:24:15,747
Then it looks
like I have a date

606
00:24:15,749 --> 00:24:18,583
with your girlfriend
in the morning.

[Elevator bell dings]

608
00:24:55,187 --> 00:24:56,688
Weren't you supposed
to be announced?

609
00:24:56,690 --> 00:24:58,890
I don't play by those rules.

610
00:24:58,892 --> 00:25:01,159
Hmm. Somehow
that doesn't surprise me.

611
00:25:01,161 --> 00:25:02,260
What are you...

612
00:25:02,262 --> 00:25:03,961
Doing here? You're not Scottie.

613
00:25:03,963 --> 00:25:06,297
And you're not Jimmy Smits,
but we make do.

614
00:25:06,299 --> 00:25:08,099
Are you making
an <i>L.A. Law</i> reference?

615
00:25:08,101 --> 00:25:10,568
No, I'm saying I wish
I had a date with Jimmy Smits.

616
00:25:10,570 --> 00:25:12,737
- Ah.
- But instead I'm here...

617
00:25:12,739 --> 00:25:14,972
To tell you that Edward's
in another league.

618
00:25:14,974 --> 00:25:16,040
You're going to lose.

619
00:25:16,042 --> 00:25:17,075
Well, there's only one problem.

620
00:25:17,077 --> 00:25:18,743
Words are coming
out of your mouth,

621
00:25:18,745 --> 00:25:20,445
which means
the real story isn't.

622
00:25:20,447 --> 00:25:21,579
Okay, you want the real story?

623
00:25:21,581 --> 00:25:22,947
Your clients
are running out of funds.

624
00:25:22,949 --> 00:25:24,949
You have a window. To do what?

625
00:25:24,951 --> 00:25:27,185
- Give up.
- [Chuckles]

626
00:25:27,187 --> 00:25:29,620
No, I don't think
that's going to cut it for us.

Why not?

628
00:25:30,757 --> 00:25:32,056
Because...

629
00:25:32,058 --> 00:25:33,691
We have this.

[File thuds]

631
00:25:36,596 --> 00:25:39,530
Harvey, we still have
to work together after this.

632
00:25:39,532 --> 00:25:40,665
I am giving you a way out.

633
00:25:40,667 --> 00:25:42,100
We can still both
be name partners.

634
00:25:42,102 --> 00:25:43,101
No, we can't.

635
00:25:43,103 --> 00:25:45,036
I made a deal with Jessica.

636
00:25:45,038 --> 00:25:46,304
I win, you're out.

637
00:25:46,306 --> 00:25:47,505
I give up,

638
00:25:47,507 --> 00:25:50,375
you're going to be name partner
all by yourself.

639
00:25:52,378 --> 00:25:55,480
That's not what I want.

640
00:25:55,482 --> 00:25:57,215
Harvey, don't you get it?
Wait a second.

641
00:25:57,217 --> 00:25:59,751
If you're here,
who the hell's in with Mike?

642
00:26:03,088 --> 00:26:06,524
Get out.

643
00:26:10,929 --> 00:26:12,430
You're angry.

644
00:26:12,432 --> 00:26:14,966
This isn't funny, Harvey.
You just broke the law.

645
00:26:14,968 --> 00:26:17,235
It's a civil law.
No one's going to go to jail.

646
00:26:17,237 --> 00:26:19,437
Justify it all you want,
but you cheated.

647
00:26:19,439 --> 00:26:21,272
Like you,
subbing in for Scottie?

648
00:26:21,274 --> 00:26:23,307
I see what you're doing.

649
00:26:23,309 --> 00:26:26,310
You know damn well
Darby plays by the rules.

650
00:26:26,312 --> 00:26:28,413
So if you win by cheating,
you win.

651
00:26:28,415 --> 00:26:30,515
And if you lose,
then they think you're dirty,

652
00:26:30,517 --> 00:26:31,816

653
00:26:31,818 --> 00:26:33,151
You really want to merge

for your help to win?

He didn't ask.

I guess that's a preview
of things to come.

659
00:26:40,493 --> 00:26:42,693
And is that little stunt
you pulled

00:26:42,695 --> 00:26:44,495
a preview of things to come?

We won. We're strong.
We've got money.

663

And if we do this,
we go to the next level.

664
00:26:53,773 --> 00:26:56,641
We'll be the biggest,
baddest fish in the sea.

it's the same out there,
only worse.

680
00:27:29,976 --> 00:27:32,477
And you'll be a winner,
but not a leader,

and you won't have me.

hasn't gone through yet,

you're not allowed to be lurking
around our files.

00:28:30,996 --> 00:28:34,864
and it is none
of your business.

701
00:28:34,866 --> 00:28:37,934
But, no.

702
00:28:37,936 --> 00:28:39,435
And I did like you,

703
00:28:39,437 --> 00:28:42,071
until you walked in here
with that bullshit agenda and...

704
00:28:42,073 --> 00:28:43,139
It's not bullshit.

705
00:28:43,141 --> 00:28:46,676
Okay, then what
would you call it?

706
00:28:46,678 --> 00:28:49,479
Why do you think
I came back last time?

707
00:28:49,481 --> 00:28:51,514
Why do you think
I brought us in on Folsom?

708
00:28:51,516 --> 00:28:53,349
I don't know
how to get his attention

709
00:28:53,351 --> 00:28:55,351
unless I sue him.

710
00:28:55,353 --> 00:28:57,320
You're in love with him.

711
00:28:57,322 --> 00:29:01,157
He's he's just so angry at me,

712
00:29:01,159 --> 00:29:03,426
and I-I don't know
how to make him believe it.

713
00:29:03,428 --> 00:29:04,861
Well, why would he believe you?

714
00:29:04,863 --> 00:29:06,963
All you've ever done
is lie to him.

715
00:29:06,965 --> 00:29:09,399
This is not...

716
00:29:09,401 --> 00:29:10,900
This is not a lie.

717
00:29:10,902 --> 00:29:14,637
Look, Dana, if you want
to break through his anger,

718
00:29:14,639 --> 00:29:17,740
you're going to have
to do something.

719
00:29:20,311 --> 00:29:21,377
The merger.

720
00:29:21,379 --> 00:29:23,379
Walk away.

721
00:29:23,381 --> 00:29:25,214
[Scoffs]
From my name on the door.

722
00:29:25,216 --> 00:29:26,883
If you want him to hear you,

723
00:29:26,885 --> 00:29:28,785
you're going to have to make
a sacrifice.

724
00:29:28,787 --> 00:29:31,220
So I just...

725
00:29:31,222 --> 00:29:34,457
Risk everything
with no guarantee.

726
00:29:34,459 --> 00:29:37,427
That's what sacrifice is.

727
00:29:46,837 --> 00:29:49,072
I got your message.

728
00:29:49,074 --> 00:29:50,406
Why are we meeting here?

729
00:29:50,408 --> 00:29:51,975
You sound like
you don't trust me.

730
00:29:51,977 --> 00:29:54,177
Well, you did sandbag me
with Jessica.

731
00:29:54,179 --> 00:29:55,979
Jessica sandbagged you
with Jessica.

732
00:29:55,981 --> 00:29:59,248
Still doesn't explain
why we're meeting here.

733
00:30:01,251 --> 00:30:02,618
Baby Harvey.

734
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:05,154
[Scoffs]
That's a huge compliment.

735
00:30:05,156 --> 00:30:07,190
- Call it like I see it.
- I meant for him.

736
00:30:07,192 --> 00:30:11,260
Like I said, baby Harvey.

737
00:30:11,262 --> 00:30:13,096
[Clears throat]

738
00:30:13,098 --> 00:30:16,766
We're meeting here because you
will never find this.

739
00:30:21,772 --> 00:30:23,840
If this checks out,
it'll win the case for us.

740
00:30:23,842 --> 00:30:26,609
I know.

741
00:30:26,611 --> 00:30:29,579
And why am I the one
you're giving this to?

742
00:30:29,581 --> 00:30:30,947
Because there are
some things in life

743
00:30:30,949 --> 00:30:32,582
more important than winning.

744
00:30:32,584 --> 00:30:35,051
That's not what I asked.

745
00:30:35,053 --> 00:30:38,554
Why are you giving it to me?

746
00:30:38,556 --> 00:30:40,823
When we were in law school,

747
00:30:40,825 --> 00:30:43,326
Harvey's brother got sick.

748
00:30:43,328 --> 00:30:45,561
He needed money.
His father didn't have any.

749
00:30:45,563 --> 00:30:47,030
His mother
wasn't in the picture.

750
00:30:47,032 --> 00:30:48,064
Don't tell me.

751
00:30:48,066 --> 00:30:49,832
Harvey found a way
to help him out.

752
00:30:49,834 --> 00:30:50,967
He used his tuition.

753
00:30:50,969 --> 00:30:53,903
Anyway...

754
00:30:53,905 --> 00:30:57,106
When his mother found out,
she contacted him.

755
00:30:57,108 --> 00:30:58,708
Harvey wouldn't take a nickel
from her.

756
00:30:58,710 --> 00:31:00,877
So she gave his brother
the money.

757
00:31:00,879 --> 00:31:02,779
Who used it to pay him back.

758
00:31:02,781 --> 00:31:04,947
I didn't even know
Harvey had a brother.

759
00:31:04,949 --> 00:31:06,749
You'd like him.

760
00:31:06,751 --> 00:31:08,751
He's like you.

761
00:31:11,855 --> 00:31:14,057
So are you saying
that I have to tell Harvey

762
00:31:14,059 --> 00:31:15,758
I found this on my own?

763
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:18,628
You don't have to.

764
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:22,999
But it'll definitely increase
your odds of him using it.

765
00:31:24,668 --> 00:31:26,602
- I found something.
- Let me see.

766
00:31:26,604 --> 00:31:28,237
It's not done.
We have to hurry.

767
00:31:28,239 --> 00:31:29,772
But I can get it done
before tomorrow morning.

768
00:31:29,774 --> 00:31:31,274
This is good.

769
00:31:31,276 --> 00:31:33,009
I know.

770
00:31:33,011 --> 00:31:35,878
Get on it. Where'd you get it?

771
00:31:37,514 --> 00:31:38,648
You know where I got it.

772
00:31:38,650 --> 00:31:41,117
The question is,
are you going to let me use it?

773
00:31:41,119 --> 00:31:43,686
- Get out.
- Harvey, we can win with this.

774
00:31:43,688 --> 00:31:45,855
Here's what you don't get.
You can't trust her.

775
00:31:45,857 --> 00:31:47,056
If it came from her,

776
00:31:47,058 --> 00:31:48,624
it'll come back to bite us
in the ass.

777
00:31:48,626 --> 00:31:51,027
Tomorrow morning is coming,
and we don't have anything else.

778
00:31:51,029 --> 00:31:54,330
- Then go find me something.
- Okay.

779
00:31:57,234 --> 00:31:58,601
Pardon me. Excuse me.

780
00:31:58,603 --> 00:32:00,236
Do you mind
if I have a little more lemon?

781
00:32:00,238 --> 00:32:02,238
Thanks.

782
00:32:06,643 --> 00:32:07,710
You were at the show?

783
00:32:07,712 --> 00:32:09,345
Seat 4-A. You?

784
00:32:09,347 --> 00:32:13,149
Seat A-4.
Shakespeare well performed.

785
00:32:13,151 --> 00:32:14,684
Indeed...

786
00:32:14,686 --> 00:32:15,685
Though not improved

787
00:32:15,687 --> 00:32:17,520
by the yammering
of that battle axe.

788
00:32:17,522 --> 00:32:19,589
Well, thank God she stopped
after the first act.

789
00:32:19,591 --> 00:32:20,656
Thank you.

790
00:32:20,658 --> 00:32:24,861
Well, she didn't
precisely stop.

791
00:32:24,863 --> 00:32:26,062
You had her removed?

792
00:32:26,064 --> 00:32:27,697
Told her
the baby-sitter phoned,

793
00:32:27,699 --> 00:32:29,866
and the children were on fire.

794
00:32:29,868 --> 00:32:31,033
What's that?

795
00:32:31,035 --> 00:32:33,536
One row up...
some douche bag was texting.

796
00:32:33,538 --> 00:32:36,372
Took it from him,
didn't even know.

797
00:32:36,374 --> 00:32:39,175
Oh, uh, please.

798
00:32:42,346 --> 00:32:44,547
Incidentally, excellent use
of the word "douche bag."

799
00:32:44,549 --> 00:32:46,415
Well, I've had a lot
of experience with them.

800
00:32:46,417 --> 00:32:47,917
As have I.

801
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:50,586
I don't make friends
very easily.

802
00:32:50,588 --> 00:32:52,088
That's funny.

803
00:32:52,090 --> 00:32:54,724
When I was a kid...

804
00:32:54,726 --> 00:32:56,592
There was a bunch of them.

805
00:32:56,594 --> 00:32:59,128
And, uh, every day
there was something new,

806
00:32:59,130 --> 00:33:00,129
meaner and meaner.

807
00:33:00,131 --> 00:33:02,131
Most of them
were just followers,

808
00:33:02,133 --> 00:33:05,535
but there was that one...
Kirk Breslin.

809
00:33:05,537 --> 00:33:06,802
Julian Hunt.

810
00:33:06,804 --> 00:33:10,640
And then one day
I decided to be mean.

811
00:33:10,642 --> 00:33:12,808
I just told
that bully piece of shit

812
00:33:12,810 --> 00:33:14,377
that he'd never be anything,
do anything,

813
00:33:14,379 --> 00:33:16,479
or amount to anything.

814
00:33:16,481 --> 00:33:18,080
After that, they never made fun
of me again.

815
00:33:18,082 --> 00:33:20,850
In fact, they, uh...

816
00:33:20,852 --> 00:33:25,488
They never talked to me again.

817
00:33:25,490 --> 00:33:28,691
Right.

818
00:33:28,693 --> 00:33:31,727
I shouldn't have impugned
Baden-Baden.

819
00:33:31,729 --> 00:33:34,263
It's just that when I asked you
if you took mud,

820
00:33:34,265 --> 00:33:36,332
I was...

821
00:33:36,334 --> 00:33:41,003
Offering a warm,
muddied hand of friendship,

822
00:33:41,005 --> 00:33:44,640
and you took that hand
and wiped it clean.

823
00:33:44,642 --> 00:33:46,943
Well, I didn't recognize
the gesture.

824
00:33:46,945 --> 00:33:48,177
I understand.

825
00:33:48,179 --> 00:33:50,446
It's a lonely job,
being the hatchet man.

826
00:33:50,448 --> 00:33:53,849
Yeah, well, I guess
it's, uh, our cross to bear.

827
00:33:53,851 --> 00:33:55,851
Hmm.

828
00:33:59,356 --> 00:34:01,357
Can I be honest with you?

829
00:34:01,359 --> 00:34:03,192
With the results
of my efficiency list,

830
00:34:03,194 --> 00:34:05,628
I keep arriving
at the same conclusion.

831
00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:07,863
There's no room for both of us.

832
00:34:07,865 --> 00:34:11,534
[Sighs] Unless...

833
00:34:11,536 --> 00:34:14,203
We made room for each other.

834
00:34:17,374 --> 00:34:19,809
I leave you off my list.

835
00:34:19,811 --> 00:34:22,612
And I leave you off mine.

836
00:34:22,614 --> 00:34:23,813
Well, would you be willing

837
00:34:23,815 --> 00:34:25,915
to sacrifice the integrity
of your list?

838
00:34:25,917 --> 00:34:28,451
[Sighs]

839
00:34:28,453 --> 00:34:31,454
I would...

840
00:34:31,456 --> 00:34:33,623
For a friend.

841
00:34:46,203 --> 00:34:47,837
What the hell
is wrong with you?

842
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:49,972
I have a feeling
you're about to tell me.

843
00:34:49,974 --> 00:34:52,308
Are you for this merger
or against it?

844
00:34:52,310 --> 00:34:53,809
I'm against it.

845
00:34:53,811 --> 00:34:54,910
Why? Never mind.

846
00:34:54,912 --> 00:34:56,545
I'm going to tell you why...

847
00:34:56,547 --> 00:34:57,847
because of Scottie.

848
00:34:57,849 --> 00:35:01,017
If I can't trust her,
how can I trust any of it?

849
00:35:01,019 --> 00:35:03,953
She's showing you you can
by throwing it all away.

850
00:35:03,955 --> 00:35:07,189
That folder
is a wild-goose chase.

851
00:35:07,191 --> 00:35:09,492
Oh, my God. For somebody
who's usually three steps ahead,

852
00:35:09,494 --> 00:35:10,926
you are a mile behind.

853
00:35:10,928 --> 00:35:12,662
She is in love
with you, Harvey...

854
00:35:12,664 --> 00:35:15,097
Only she can't tell you that

855
00:35:15,099 --> 00:35:16,732
because she,
like everybody else,

856
00:35:16,734 --> 00:35:18,701
knows that it will only
drive you away.

857
00:35:18,703 --> 00:35:20,136
- Donna.
- If she had shown up here

858
00:35:20,138 --> 00:35:21,704
and asked you
to start a relationship,

859
00:35:21,706 --> 00:35:24,273
would you have said yes?

860
00:35:24,275 --> 00:35:27,276
No, you wouldn't have.
It's not that simple.

861
00:35:27,278 --> 00:35:28,577
Was it not that simple
with Zoe?

862
00:35:28,579 --> 00:35:29,745
What the hell
does that have to do with it?

863
00:35:29,747 --> 00:35:30,980
You let her go.

864
00:35:30,982 --> 00:35:33,316
She left me to raise her niece.

865
00:35:33,318 --> 00:35:35,851
- Did you ask her to stay?
- It wasn't on the table.

866
00:35:35,853 --> 00:35:37,153
She wanted you to fight.

867
00:35:37,155 --> 00:35:39,689
That poor girl
was losing her father,

868
00:35:39,691 --> 00:35:41,724
and I wasn't about to try
and replace him

869
00:35:41,726 --> 00:35:42,725
while it was happening.

870
00:35:42,727 --> 00:35:44,627
Bullshit! You let her go!

871
00:35:44,629 --> 00:35:47,530
And I am so sick
of watching you fight like hell

872
00:35:47,532 --> 00:35:49,198
for everything
that happens in here

873
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,067
and nothing
that happens in here.

874
00:35:51,069 --> 00:35:52,868
- Is this about Zoe?
- No.

875
00:35:52,870 --> 00:35:53,903
Is this about you?

876
00:35:53,905 --> 00:35:56,472
No.

877
00:35:56,474 --> 00:36:00,142
This is about Scottie.

878
00:36:00,144 --> 00:36:01,677
You don't know what she did.

879
00:36:01,679 --> 00:36:03,779
I do know what she did.

880
00:36:03,781 --> 00:36:05,981
She cheated on her fiance,
so you think that that means

881
00:36:05,983 --> 00:36:07,483
that there
will always be a chance

882
00:36:07,485 --> 00:36:08,684
that she will cheat on you.

883
00:36:08,686 --> 00:36:10,820
The difference is,
she didn't love him.

884
00:36:10,822 --> 00:36:14,423
She loves you.

885
00:36:14,425 --> 00:36:17,893
Look, I know
that your mother hurt you,

886
00:36:17,895 --> 00:36:19,662
but you need to get over it.

887
00:36:19,664 --> 00:36:22,531
You think
that's what I'm worried about?

888
00:36:22,533 --> 00:36:25,101
She made me
make a fool out of him,

889
00:36:25,103 --> 00:36:26,369
a man I'd never met,

890
00:36:26,371 --> 00:36:29,939
a man who'd never done
a wrong to me.

891
00:36:29,941 --> 00:36:31,440
How am I going to trust someone

892
00:36:31,442 --> 00:36:34,577
who made me a man who did that?

893
00:36:34,579 --> 00:36:37,113
Maybe you can't trust her.

894
00:36:37,115 --> 00:36:39,448
But if you want to end
this merger,

895
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:42,551
you better trust
what she gave Mike.

896
00:36:51,561 --> 00:36:55,865
Give him the file.

897
00:36:55,867 --> 00:37:00,136
What do you think
I did four hours ago?

898
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:05,541
You wanted to see me?

899
00:37:05,543 --> 00:37:07,543
That request went out
two hours ago.

900
00:37:07,545 --> 00:37:09,278
Uh, yeah, I was
in the middle of something.

901
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,480
What were you in the middle of?

902
00:37:10,481 --> 00:37:12,214
Excuse me?

903
00:37:12,216 --> 00:37:14,183
You said you were
in the middle of something.

904
00:37:14,185 --> 00:37:15,651
I assume it's Harvey's case.

905
00:37:15,653 --> 00:37:17,420
I can't tell you that.
You're on the other side.

906
00:37:17,422 --> 00:37:18,654
Is there some rule

907
00:37:18,656 --> 00:37:22,224
against my checking
on my own employee?

908
00:37:25,762 --> 00:37:28,864
I'm confident that,
after tomorrow,

909
00:37:28,866 --> 00:37:30,433
you'll either settle or lose.

910
00:37:30,435 --> 00:37:32,101
And why is that?

911
00:37:32,103 --> 00:37:33,602
Because I've prepared a motion

912
00:37:33,604 --> 00:37:35,471
based on a file
dated September 14th.

913
00:37:35,473 --> 00:37:37,440
Darby didn't tell me
about that.

914
00:37:37,442 --> 00:37:39,308
He didn't know about it.

915
00:37:39,310 --> 00:37:41,610
Where'd you get it?

916
00:37:41,612 --> 00:37:43,312
[Sighs]

917
00:37:43,314 --> 00:37:44,647
Hmm.

918
00:37:44,649 --> 00:37:47,416
What does it say?

919
00:37:47,418 --> 00:37:50,453
It says you're going to lose.

920
00:37:50,455 --> 00:37:52,755
Then that's too bad...

921
00:37:52,757 --> 00:37:56,759
Because you're going
to throw it away.

922
00:37:56,761 --> 00:37:59,195
- What?
- You heard me.

923
00:37:59,197 --> 00:38:00,429
You're going to go home.

924
00:38:00,431 --> 00:38:02,932
You don't call,
you don't answer,

925
00:38:02,934 --> 00:38:05,601
and you don't come back
until that deadline is passed.

926
00:38:05,603 --> 00:38:07,169
Wait a minute.
These are your clients.

927
00:38:07,171 --> 00:38:08,571
Who Harvey is using.

928
00:38:08,573 --> 00:38:12,208
- That's a bullshit argument.
- And so is that file.

929
00:38:15,111 --> 00:38:16,312
- I won't.
- You will.

930
00:38:16,314 --> 00:38:17,580
Harvey will never forgive me.

931
00:38:17,582 --> 00:38:20,082
Right now your problem
isn't with Harvey.

932
00:38:20,084 --> 00:38:22,084
Your problem is with me.

933
00:38:22,086 --> 00:38:23,319
You don't do this,

934
00:38:23,321 --> 00:38:25,721
who's to say
you don't end up in a cell

935
00:38:25,723 --> 00:38:28,724
for practicing law
without a degree?

936
00:38:32,762 --> 00:38:34,630
And who's to say you don't
share that cell with me

937
00:38:34,632 --> 00:38:36,298
for knowing about it
the whole time?

938
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:37,867
You don't want
to take that tact.

939
00:38:37,869 --> 00:38:39,835
- I didn't start it.
- I will beat you.

940
00:38:39,837 --> 00:38:41,136
The last time
you said that to me,

941
00:38:41,138 --> 00:38:43,339
you thought
you didn't need a computer.

942
00:38:43,341 --> 00:38:44,473
You were wrong.

943
00:38:44,475 --> 00:38:46,275
That was
about demonstrating knowledge,

944
00:38:46,277 --> 00:38:48,310
and the stakes were nothing.

945
00:38:48,312 --> 00:38:50,479
This is about my power,

946
00:38:50,481 --> 00:38:54,350
and the stakes are everything.

947
00:38:54,352 --> 00:38:56,285
This is a letter
to the district attorney,

948
00:38:56,287 --> 00:38:58,621
saying that it's come
to my attention

949
00:38:58,623 --> 00:39:01,123
that you are breaking the law.

950
00:39:01,125 --> 00:39:02,558
I believe you've met him...

951
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:05,761
not the type to let it slide.

952
00:39:07,631 --> 00:39:10,766
You file your motion...

953
00:39:10,768 --> 00:39:12,434
I'll file mine.

954
00:39:27,236 --> 00:39:29,803
[Footsteps approaching]

955
00:39:29,805 --> 00:39:31,838
Okay, look, Harvey...
shut your mouth!

956
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,473
I risked everything for you.

957
00:39:33,475 --> 00:39:35,475
Then I did it again and again.

958
00:39:35,477 --> 00:39:37,677
- Wait. You weren't there.
- I didn't have to be.

959
00:39:37,679 --> 00:39:39,012
- Jessica...
- You don't work for Jessica.

960
00:39:39,014 --> 00:39:40,013
You work for me.

961
00:39:40,015 --> 00:39:41,314
I know I do,

962
00:39:41,316 --> 00:39:43,083
but I was just trying
to get you what you wanted...

963
00:39:43,085 --> 00:39:44,551
your name on the door.

964
00:39:44,553 --> 00:39:46,219
No, you got
Edward Darby's name on the door.

965
00:39:46,221 --> 00:39:48,088
My part of the deal is gone.

966
00:39:48,090 --> 00:39:50,357
What? You never told me that.

967
00:39:50,359 --> 00:39:52,325
I didn't think I needed
to tell you that

968
00:39:52,327 --> 00:39:54,795
because I didn't think
you would ever betray me.

969
00:39:54,797 --> 00:39:56,496
Harvey,
look at what we've done...

970
00:39:56,498 --> 00:39:58,298
you and me.

971
00:39:58,300 --> 00:39:59,866
You broke the Chinese wall.

972
00:39:59,868 --> 00:40:02,135
I got information
directly from Scottie.

973
00:40:02,137 --> 00:40:04,704
That's two ethical violations
that six weeks ago

974
00:40:04,706 --> 00:40:06,206
would have made
your stomach turn.

975
00:40:06,208 --> 00:40:07,707
- That's not why you did it.
- Fine.

976
00:40:07,709 --> 00:40:10,110
But look me in the eye and
tell me it's not true anyway.

977
00:40:10,112 --> 00:40:11,678
You know what,
it doesn't matter

978
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:14,614
because you don't get to make
my decisions for me.

979
00:40:14,616 --> 00:40:17,851
Isn't that what you
were trying to do for me?

980
00:40:17,853 --> 00:40:19,553
This is a private conversation.

981
00:40:19,555 --> 00:40:21,721
You want to have it out,
let's have it out...

982
00:40:21,723 --> 00:40:23,256
right now.

983
00:40:23,258 --> 00:40:25,392
You might want to go.

984
00:40:27,495 --> 00:40:29,429
I'm sorry.

985
00:40:29,431 --> 00:40:30,897
You're back
in the associates' pool.

986
00:40:30,899 --> 00:40:32,566
Harvey, come on.

987
00:40:32,568 --> 00:40:34,568
Turns out you're not
the best lawyer I've ever seen.

988
00:40:34,570 --> 00:40:35,869
In fact, you're fired.

989
00:40:35,871 --> 00:40:37,737
No, he's not.

990
00:40:37,739 --> 00:40:39,873
Oh, you going to overrule me
on that too?

991
00:40:39,875 --> 00:40:42,075
You can go.

992
00:40:47,381 --> 00:40:50,016
I didn't overrule you
on the other.

993
00:40:50,018 --> 00:40:51,718
I beat you fair and square.

994
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:54,421
- No, you didn't.
- You're right.

995
00:40:54,423 --> 00:40:56,756
I cheated, like you.

996
00:40:56,758 --> 00:40:59,359
You jumped to the other side.

997
00:40:59,361 --> 00:41:01,695
You put me on the other side.

998
00:41:01,697 --> 00:41:03,597
I had a deal

999
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:06,867
that put your name
right next to mine.

1000
00:41:06,869 --> 00:41:08,501
And it wasn't even
up there yet,

1001
00:41:08,503 --> 00:41:10,437
and you started acting
like it was on top of mine.

1002
00:41:10,439 --> 00:41:12,706
- To protect you.
- Bullshit.

1003
00:41:12,708 --> 00:41:14,007
This wasn't
about protecting me.

1004
00:41:14,009 --> 00:41:15,542
This was about advancing you.

1005
00:41:15,544 --> 00:41:17,110
That's what this whole thing
is about.

1006
00:41:17,112 --> 00:41:18,411
What?

1007
00:41:18,413 --> 00:41:19,980
Hardman said it.
I didn't think it was true.

1008
00:41:19,982 --> 00:41:22,048
He said you don't trust me.

1009
00:41:22,050 --> 00:41:25,185
He meant you're afraid of me.

1010
00:41:25,187 --> 00:41:28,421
Afraid of you?

1011
00:41:28,423 --> 00:41:30,824
Boy, I just kicked your ass.

1012
00:41:30,826 --> 00:41:32,826
And you didn't just want it.

1013
00:41:32,828 --> 00:41:35,729
You begged me for it.

1014
00:41:35,731 --> 00:41:39,666
So now you're going
to stay here,

1015
00:41:39,668 --> 00:41:41,668
be humble,

1016
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:44,170
and learn your goddamn place.

1017
00:43:05,219 --> 00:43:08,421
[Elevator bell dings]

1018
00:43:10,224 --> 00:43:12,025
You could have just told me
that you didn't love me

1019
00:43:12,027 --> 00:43:13,626
instead of selling me out.

1020
00:43:13,628 --> 00:43:15,562
I didn't sell you out, Scottie.

1021
00:43:15,564 --> 00:43:17,197
Well, somebody did

1022
00:43:17,199 --> 00:43:18,932
because Darby found out
what I gave Mike,

1023
00:43:18,934 --> 00:43:22,235
and I just got fired.

1024
00:43:22,237 --> 00:43:25,171
It wasn't me.

1025
00:43:25,173 --> 00:43:26,840
Well...

1026
00:43:26,842 --> 00:43:30,577
At least there's that.

1027
00:43:30,579 --> 00:43:33,279
Good-bye, Harvey.

1028
00:44:00,674 --> 00:44:03,309
And then we just toasted to it,

1029
00:44:03,311 --> 00:44:06,679
one hatchet man to the other.

1030
00:44:06,681 --> 00:44:07,914
Wow, Louis.

1031
00:44:07,916 --> 00:44:11,117
That's the sweetest story
I've ever heard.

1032
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:14,754
- I broke my word.
- What?

1033
00:44:14,756 --> 00:44:16,589
I put him on the list,
and I handed it in.

1034
00:44:16,591 --> 00:44:17,791
How could you do that?

1035
00:44:17,793 --> 00:44:19,659
I realized I couldn't do that
to my list.

1036
00:44:19,661 --> 00:44:21,027
I wouldn't be able
to live with myself,

1037
00:44:21,029 --> 00:44:23,096
which means he couldn't either.

1038
00:44:23,098 --> 00:44:25,098
Yes, he could.

1039
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:26,166
Meaning?

1040
00:44:26,168 --> 00:44:29,169
He didn't put you on his list.

Not that.

I couldn't be a good friend
to Nigel,

friend to Rachel, and I wasn't.

to make it right.

welcome you to the firm

1052
00:45:01,770 --> 00:45:02,769
with open arms.

1053
00:45:02,771 --> 00:45:04,704
I'm not much of a hugger.

1054
00:45:04,706 --> 00:45:06,906
Good.

1055
00:45:14,315 --> 00:45:16,716
One more thing...
Jessica was wrong.

1056
00:45:16,718 --> 00:45:18,451
Scottie didn't give me
anything.

1057
00:45:18,453 --> 00:45:20,787
I took it.

1058
00:45:20,789 --> 00:45:22,322
You say you're a man
of your word,

1059
00:45:22,324 --> 00:45:24,991
yet you're lying for her.

1060
00:45:26,794 --> 00:45:27,794
I am.

1061
00:45:27,796 --> 00:45:29,629
Honorable nonetheless.

1062
00:45:29,631 --> 00:45:32,065
What would you have me do?
Give her her job back.

1063
00:45:32,067 --> 00:45:34,067
What reason
would I have to do that?

1064
00:45:34,069 --> 00:45:35,702
Whatever she did,

1065
00:45:35,704 --> 00:45:38,805
you wouldn't have this merger
without her.

1066
00:45:38,807 --> 00:45:40,707
Fair enough.

1067
00:45:40,709 --> 00:45:43,877
Would you have her work here
or in London?

1068
00:45:56,957 --> 00:45:58,825
Rachel, look, I'm sorry,
but I am not...

1069
00:45:58,827 --> 00:46:02,128
When did you send that letter?

1070
00:46:02,130 --> 00:46:03,329
Um, I was, uh...

1071
00:46:03,331 --> 00:46:05,198
I'll tell you when... never.

1072
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:09,035
Okay, look, let me explain.

1073
00:46:09,037 --> 00:46:10,336
When I went to see Louis,

1074
00:46:10,338 --> 00:46:11,771
he told me
what really happened...

1075
00:46:11,773 --> 00:46:13,940
I know. He told me too.

1076
00:46:13,942 --> 00:46:15,542
And I get it.
I'm not good enough.

1077
00:46:15,544 --> 00:46:17,644
What I don't get, Mike, is why
you didn't have the courage

1078
00:46:17,646 --> 00:46:18,978
to just come
and tell me that yourself.

1079
00:46:18,980 --> 00:46:20,413
Look, he lied to you.

1080
00:46:20,415 --> 00:46:23,049
I thought he deserved a chance
to tell you himself, all right?

1081
00:46:23,051 --> 00:46:25,151
When I went to his office
to get him to sign the letter...

1082
00:46:25,153 --> 00:46:26,519
Wait.

1083
00:46:26,521 --> 00:46:29,455
You went to him
to sign the letter?

1084
00:46:29,457 --> 00:46:31,391
You told me you were going
to sign the letter.

1085
00:46:31,393 --> 00:46:32,992
- No...
- No, so you lied to me.

1086
00:46:32,994 --> 00:46:34,561
No, I didn't. I told you
that I would help you.

1087
00:46:34,563 --> 00:46:36,162
That is such bullshit!

1088
00:46:36,164 --> 00:46:37,797
That's not what you meant,
and you know it.

1089
00:46:37,799 --> 00:46:39,065
You've been cagey with me

1090
00:46:39,067 --> 00:46:40,600
since the second I came to you
about the letter,

1091
00:46:40,602 --> 00:46:41,935
and you're being cagey
with me right now.

1092
00:46:41,937 --> 00:46:42,969
You are. You're lying to me.

1093
00:46:42,971 --> 00:46:44,170
Not today, Rachel.

1094
00:46:44,172 --> 00:46:45,238
Please, stop.
Then what day, Mike?

1095
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:46,606
Because it's always something.

1096
00:46:46,608 --> 00:46:49,609
It is always some secret
or some story or some lie...

1097
00:46:49,611 --> 00:46:51,110
- You don't understand...
- I don't understand what?

1098
00:46:51,112 --> 00:46:52,979
You don't understand
what I have been through!

1099
00:46:52,981 --> 00:46:56,015
You don't understand
what I have lost!

1100
00:46:56,017 --> 00:46:58,885
Because it's everything,
everyone that I love...

1101
00:46:58,887 --> 00:47:00,887
Trevor, my grandmother, Harvey,

1102
00:47:00,889 --> 00:47:02,188
now, probably this job!

1103
00:47:02,190 --> 00:47:06,359
I am not ready to lose you...

1104
00:47:08,128 --> 00:47:10,463
Not today!

1105
00:47:10,465 --> 00:47:13,199
Then tell me.

1106
00:47:25,946 --> 00:47:29,382
I never went to Harvard.

1107
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:35,088
What?

1108
00:47:35,090 --> 00:47:37,690
I'm a fraud.

1109
00:47:40,995 --> 00:47:44,464
Rachel, I...

1110
00:47:44,466 --> 00:47:46,966
Rachel...
