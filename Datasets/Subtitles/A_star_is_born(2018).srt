172
00:12:33,275 --> 00:12:34,808
my virginity
or my liquor license

173
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:36,744
over you bitches, so pack up!

174
00:12:36,746 --> 00:12:38,812
- That's right!
- That's enough cocktails!

175
00:12:38,814 --> 00:12:41,115
Clear it out!
Hello, goodbye, Roger.

176
00:12:41,117 --> 00:12:42,249
Have fun!

177
00:12:42,251 --> 00:12:43,716
Bring the drinks on out!

178
00:12:43,718 --> 00:12:45,952
Do you do that often?

179
00:12:45,954 --> 00:12:47,520
- Do what?
- The show.

180
00:12:47,522 --> 00:12:50,289
Yeah, yeah. The girls
are so nice to me here.

181
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:51,958
I mean,
they would never normally

182
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:54,128
let a girl sing at
one of these shows,

183
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:56,096
but they've always
loved my voice.

184
00:12:56,098 --> 00:12:58,231
They used to beg me to sing.

185
00:12:58,233 --> 00:13:01,467
It's an honor, really. I get
to be one of the gay girls.

186
00:13:01,469 --> 00:13:03,205
Is that your real eyebrow?

187
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:07,673
Um... No. No.

188
00:13:07,675 --> 00:13:10,844
I make it out of tape.

189
00:13:10,846 --> 00:13:13,249
- Oh, so it's stuck on?
- Mmm-hmm.

190
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:17,386
Can I try to take it off?

191
00:13:18,386 --> 00:13:21,788
Uh... Yeah, sure.

192
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:23,425
It's incredible
what they do.

193
00:13:29,799 --> 00:13:30,865
Look at that.

194
00:13:30,867 --> 00:13:32,133
Oh! Yep. There it is.

195
00:13:32,135 --> 00:13:33,668
I should
put her down somewhere.

196
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:34,871
Okay.

197
00:13:37,272 --> 00:13:39,506
There we go.

198
00:13:39,508 --> 00:13:41,174
Why're you covering your eye?

199
00:13:41,176 --> 00:13:43,177
Oh, just 'cause I don't have
my eyebrow on anymore.

200
00:13:43,179 --> 00:13:46,049
Oh, no, no. The whole point is
I can see your face.

201
00:13:46,848 --> 00:13:48,383
Yeah, there we go.

202
00:13:54,491 --> 00:13:57,057
Why did you come back here?

203
00:13:57,059 --> 00:14:00,126
Your friend brought me
back here. I'm glad he did.

204
00:14:00,128 --> 00:14:01,764
Can I buy you a drink?

205
00:14:02,832 --> 00:14:04,264
Oh.

206
00:14:04,266 --> 00:14:07,400
I gotta change,
and I got paint in my hair.

207
00:14:07,402 --> 00:14:08,970
- That's not your real hair?
- My eyebrows are...

208
00:14:08,972 --> 00:14:11,171
No, my hair is
like your color.

209
00:14:11,173 --> 00:14:14,010
- Oh, okay.
- But I paint it with this

210
00:14:14,709 --> 00:14:16,043
makeup.

211
00:14:16,045 --> 00:14:17,112
I'd love to see
what that looks like.

212
00:14:18,381 --> 00:14:20,049
I'll wait for you.

213
00:14:21,517 --> 00:14:22,749
Um...

214
00:14:22,751 --> 00:14:24,418
Yeah, okay. Sure.

215
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:27,187
Yeah, if you wanna wait, I'll
come have a drink with you.

216
00:14:27,189 --> 00:14:29,089
Sure.

217
00:14:29,091 --> 00:14:30,624
Bitch, can you get down
off that stage

218
00:14:30,626 --> 00:14:32,493
and come help me
close this bar, please?

219
00:14:32,495 --> 00:14:33,994
Don't talk to me like that

220
00:14:33,996 --> 00:14:35,062
in that bus driver wig, girl.

221
00:14:35,064 --> 00:14:36,629
Oh, I know you did not.

222
00:14:36,631 --> 00:14:38,465
What, you have a street
appointment tonight, sister?

223
00:14:38,467 --> 00:14:39,799
Excuse me!

224
00:14:39,801 --> 00:14:42,001
Mr. Maine, would you mind?

225
00:14:42,003 --> 00:14:43,971
Uh... What do you
want me to do?

226
00:14:43,973 --> 00:14:46,005
Just come play
a little song for me.

227
00:14:46,007 --> 00:14:47,408
I don't know.

228
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:49,009
Can you leave
the man alone, please?

229
00:14:49,011 --> 00:14:51,044
I showed you mine, you show
me yours. Come on.

230
00:14:51,046 --> 00:14:54,881
He already signed your tits,
honey. Say, "No, sir."

231
00:14:54,883 --> 00:14:56,350
Show off for me a little bit.

232
00:14:56,352 --> 00:14:58,219
I'll only do it because
you already performed.

233
00:14:58,221 --> 00:14:59,887
You're so nice.
Thank you.

234
00:14:59,889 --> 00:15:03,193
Lord, the man is here
for Ally. Not for you, sister.

235
00:15:04,993 --> 00:15:06,326
She's nice. Yeah.

236
00:15:06,328 --> 00:15:07,562
Isn't it cute?
Little arts and crafts.

237
00:15:07,564 --> 00:15:09,363
- Yeah, and light.
- Mmm-hmm.

238
00:15:09,365 --> 00:15:11,898
- Did you do this yourself?
- Yeah, all me.

239
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:13,169
Well, it's great.

240
00:15:13,868 --> 00:15:14,969
Does this mic work?

241
00:15:14,971 --> 00:15:17,104
<i>Oh, yeah. Fuck, all right.</i>

242
00:15:17,106 --> 00:15:18,638
What do you want me to play?

243
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,341
I don't care, just look at me
while you do it.

244
00:15:20,343 --> 00:15:22,308
Oh, Lord!
Somebody kill me now.

245
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:25,613
Let me see what I can...
All right.

246
00:15:31,154 --> 00:15:34,424

263
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:52,832
- It's a cop bar.
- Cops?

264
00:16:52,834 --> 00:16:55,168
Yeah, that's why
they serve all night long.

265
00:17:01,175 --> 00:17:02,743
Can I ask you
a personal question?

266
00:17:02,745 --> 00:17:04,177
Sure.

267
00:17:04,179 --> 00:17:06,148
Do you write songs
or anything?

268
00:17:07,249 --> 00:17:08,981
I don't sing my own songs.

269
00:17:08,983 --> 00:17:10,185
Thank you.

270
00:17:11,587 --> 00:17:12,588
Why?

271
00:17:15,724 --> 00:17:18,592
I just don't feel comfortable.

272
00:17:18,594 --> 00:17:20,963
Why wouldn't you
feel comfortable?

273
00:17:21,597 --> 00:17:22,762
Um...

274
00:17:22,764 --> 00:17:25,332
Well, 'cause almost
every single person

275
00:17:25,334 --> 00:17:26,999
that I've come in contact with

276
00:17:27,001 --> 00:17:28,368
in the music industry
has told me

277
00:17:28,370 --> 00:17:29,836
that my nose is too big

278
00:17:29,838 --> 00:17:31,204
and that I won't make it.

279
00:17:31,206 --> 00:17:33,906
- Your nose is too big?
- Yeah.

280
00:17:33,908 --> 00:17:36,410
Your nose is beautiful.

281
00:17:36,412 --> 00:17:38,011
Are you showing me
your nose right now?

282
00:17:38,013 --> 00:17:39,246
- Yeah.
- You don't have to show it

283
00:17:39,248 --> 00:17:40,314
to me. I've been
looking at it all night.

284
00:17:40,316 --> 00:17:41,847
Oh, come on. No, you're not.

285
00:17:41,849 --> 00:17:43,584
I'm gonna be thinking about
your nose for a very long

286
00:17:43,586 --> 00:17:45,719
- time. I'm not full of shit.
- You're full of shit.

287
00:17:45,721 --> 00:17:47,253
- Yeah, you are. Yeah, you're full of shit.
- I'm telling you the truth.

288
00:17:47,255 --> 00:17:48,521
- Can I touch your nose?
- Oh, my gosh!

289
00:17:48,523 --> 00:17:50,126
Let me just touch it
for a second.

290
00:18:00,101 --> 00:18:01,402
You're very lucky.

291
00:18:01,404 --> 00:18:04,037
- Oh, really? Yeah, not really.
- Mmm-hmm.

292
00:18:04,039 --> 00:18:06,574
My nose has not made me lucky.

293
00:18:06,576 --> 00:18:08,240
I could've had
maybe a hit song

294
00:18:08,242 --> 00:18:09,942
if it wasn't for my nose.

295
00:18:09,944 --> 00:18:11,311
That's fucking bullshit.

296
00:18:11,313 --> 00:18:12,880
Yeah. No, it's not bullshit

297
00:18:12,882 --> 00:18:14,314
because you go
into these rooms,

298
00:18:14,316 --> 00:18:16,182
and there's all these
fucking men in there,

299
00:18:16,184 --> 00:18:17,617
and they're
just staring at you,

300
00:18:17,619 --> 00:18:19,385
listening to your record,
going,

301
00:18:19,387 --> 00:18:22,588
"Oh, you sound great,
but you don't look so great."

302
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:25,226
You know, I had a thing
when I was little.

303
00:18:25,228 --> 00:18:28,596
I was born with this thing
in my ear, couldn't hear.

304
00:18:28,598 --> 00:18:31,897
What do I wind up being?
A singer, so you never know.

305
00:18:31,899 --> 00:18:35,602
Look, talent comes everywhere.
Everybody's talented.

306
00:18:35,604 --> 00:18:37,903
Bet you fucking everybody
in this bar is talented

307
00:18:37,905 --> 00:18:41,473
in one thing or another,
but having something to say

308
00:18:41,475 --> 00:18:43,876
and the way to say it
so people listen to it,

309
00:18:43,878 --> 00:18:45,112
that's a whole other bag.

310
00:18:45,114 --> 00:18:46,413
And unless you get out there

311
00:18:46,415 --> 00:18:48,414
and you try to do it,
you'll never know.

312
00:18:48,416 --> 00:18:49,916
That's just the truth.

313
00:18:49,918 --> 00:18:51,519
If there's one reason
we're supposed to be here,

314
00:18:51,521 --> 00:18:54,454
it's to say something
so people wanna hear it.

315
00:18:54,456 --> 00:18:56,089
Don't you understand
what I'm trying to tell you?

316
00:18:56,091 --> 00:18:57,458
Yeah, I do.

317
00:18:57,460 --> 00:19:00,527
I don't like it,
but I understand it.

318
00:19:00,529 --> 00:19:02,996
Oh, I think
you like it a little bit.

319
00:19:02,998 --> 00:19:06,732
I think I'm getting through
a little bit. I can see it.

320
00:19:06,734 --> 00:19:08,203
No, you can't.

321
00:19:09,437 --> 00:19:11,506
It's a good thing we met.

322
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:13,941
- Yeah.
- For both of us.

323
00:19:13,943 --> 00:19:16,076
- Trust me.
- I don't know what is going on.

324
00:19:16,078 --> 00:19:17,778
- Honestly, what...
- Who does?

325
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:21,214
I'm in a cop bar, with
Jackson Maine. It's, like...

326
00:19:21,216 --> 00:19:22,382
Jackson Maine!

327
00:19:22,384 --> 00:19:23,717
I'm gonna wake up in a minute.

328
00:19:23,719 --> 00:19:25,219
That's the thing
about when you get famous,

329
00:19:25,221 --> 00:19:27,586
people start saying
your full name.

330
00:19:27,588 --> 00:19:29,890
- Well, what do you want...
- Just "Jack."

331
00:19:29,892 --> 00:19:31,791
Oh, speaking of...

332
00:19:31,793 --> 00:19:32,960
Come on.

333
00:19:32,962 --> 00:19:35,662
- What?
- Did you put that on?

334
00:19:35,664 --> 00:19:39,766
You put that on. When did you
even go to the jukebox?

335
00:19:39,768 --> 00:19:41,201
Oh, God!

336
00:19:41,203 --> 00:19:43,671
I hear that song, and I just
wanna turn it the fuck off.

337
00:19:43,673 --> 00:19:44,704
Jack Maine!

338
00:19:44,706 --> 00:19:46,140
I fucked
that fucking song up so bad.

339
00:19:46,142 --> 00:19:47,907
- No! What? Come on.
- Oh, my God!

340
00:19:47,909 --> 00:19:50,844
Hey, I know that
we're not supposed to do this.

341
00:19:50,846 --> 00:19:53,213
I know that we're not supposed
to come and bother you.

342
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:54,882
- You come here every night.
- That's all right.

343
00:19:54,884 --> 00:19:56,749
You got your camera on you?
'Cause I don't have my camera.

344
00:19:56,751 --> 00:19:57,817
Excuse me, one sec.

345
00:19:57,819 --> 00:19:59,286
My ex-girlfriend was
fucking this guy.

346
00:19:59,288 --> 00:20:00,653
- Right. Okay.
- Who looks like you,

347
00:20:00,655 --> 00:20:01,954
- that's what she said.
- Shut the hell up.

348
00:20:01,956 --> 00:20:03,022
But I gotta take
a picture of you

349
00:20:03,024 --> 00:20:04,391
because I gotta send it to her

350
00:20:04,393 --> 00:20:05,659
because I'm gonna show her
that you look

351
00:20:05,661 --> 00:20:06,925
nothing fucking like
that fucking guy.

352
00:20:06,927 --> 00:20:08,194
Jack, I'm sorry.

353
00:20:08,196 --> 00:20:09,663
Maybe that'll help her out.

354
00:20:09,665 --> 00:20:11,163
Will that help you out?
Will that make you happy?

355
00:20:11,165 --> 00:20:12,399
Why don't we take
the fucking picture?

356
00:20:12,401 --> 00:20:13,733
You want someone
to take the picture?

357
00:20:13,735 --> 00:20:15,169
- Hey, no, no. It's okay.
- Excuse me.

358
00:20:15,171 --> 00:20:16,736
You want someone
to take the picture?

359
00:20:16,738 --> 00:20:18,338
- Get the fuck off, you little whore.
- What? What?

360
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:20,272
- Hey, come on. Stand up, yeah.
- What?

361
00:20:21,542 --> 00:20:23,276
- I'm sorry! No, Jack!
- I got you.

362
00:20:23,278 --> 00:20:24,544
- It's all right.
- Oh, my God!

363
00:20:24,546 --> 00:20:25,780
- No, no, it's all right.
- Why did I...

364
00:20:28,884 --> 00:20:32,451
I'm fine, honestly. I'm okay.
This is so stupid.

365
00:20:32,453 --> 00:20:35,321
No, you gotta get ahead
of the swelling.

366
00:20:35,323 --> 00:20:37,022
Just try to find some...

367
00:20:37,024 --> 00:20:39,161
This is so embarrassing.

368
00:20:40,296 --> 00:20:43,696
Here we go.
Yeah, put that on there.

369
00:20:43,698 --> 00:20:46,635
Gotta wrap something up
with it. Find it.

370
00:20:48,235 --> 00:20:50,537
- You like Cheetos?
- No, like gauze.

371
00:20:50,539 --> 00:20:52,506
- Some gauze or something.
- Gauze?

372
00:20:52,508 --> 00:20:54,644
Try to do that.
With that hand.

373
00:20:55,677 --> 00:20:57,179
And do that hand.

374
00:20:58,012 --> 00:20:59,447
You play piano?

375
00:21:00,682 --> 00:21:02,249
Yeah, we gotta
take care of this, then.

376
00:21:02,251 --> 00:21:04,787
Oh, okay. Thanks.

377
00:21:11,126 --> 00:21:13,492
And that's it, yeah. No, but
keep that on there, hold on.

378
00:21:13,494 --> 00:21:16,296
Can you do that? Yeah.
Did you get it?

379
00:21:16,298 --> 00:21:18,064
It's already gotten warm,
hasn't it?

380
00:21:18,066 --> 00:21:20,469
- Should we have gotten two?
- It's okay. No, it's okay.

381
00:21:21,369 --> 00:21:23,135
Thanks.

382
00:21:23,137 --> 00:21:25,939
I'm sorry. I had to.

383
00:21:25,941 --> 00:21:27,443
That's all right.

384
00:21:28,809 --> 00:21:30,144
It's not really all right,
though.

385
00:21:30,146 --> 00:21:32,045
Have a good one.

386
00:21:32,047 --> 00:21:34,047
Be careful, she'll hit you.

387
00:21:36,617 --> 00:21:38,685
These rings
are gonna get stuck

388
00:21:38,687 --> 00:21:40,388
if you don't take them off.

389
00:21:41,924 --> 00:21:43,623
- Does that hurt?
- Yeah.

390
00:21:43,625 --> 00:21:45,625
- That's okay, though.
- May I?

391
00:21:45,627 --> 00:21:46,795
Yeah.

392
00:21:54,069 --> 00:21:56,737
Safekeeping.

393
00:21:56,739 --> 00:21:58,939
- Put this on there.
- You're a sweetheart.

394
00:21:58,941 --> 00:22:00,606
And we'll just wrap it up.

395
00:22:00,608 --> 00:22:02,509
You'll be good to go.

396
00:22:02,511 --> 00:22:05,179
How the hell do you deal
with that all the time?

397
00:22:05,181 --> 00:22:07,814
- What's that?
- People just

398
00:22:07,816 --> 00:22:09,715
talking to you
like you're not a real person

399
00:22:09,717 --> 00:22:11,585
- or taking your picture.
- Is that too tight?

400
00:22:11,587 --> 00:22:13,653
It's okay, thanks.

401
00:22:13,655 --> 00:22:17,191
- Oh. I hurt you.
- That's fine, it's okay. Ow...

402
00:22:17,193 --> 00:22:19,992
There we go.
Now, you're mobile.

403
00:22:19,994 --> 00:22:21,461
Swing it around.

404
00:22:23,264 --> 00:22:24,597
I look like a pirate.

405
00:22:24,599 --> 00:22:27,534
Right? I told you
it was worth coming here.

406
00:22:27,536 --> 00:22:29,236
How do you do that?

407
00:22:29,238 --> 00:22:31,505
- Do what?
- Don't change the subject.

408
00:22:31,507 --> 00:22:32,838
Is that what I'm doing?

409
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,944
Nobody ever asked you
about you, huh?

410
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:38,644
- Not sure.
- Where are you from?

411
00:22:38,646 --> 00:22:39,881
Arizona.

412
00:22:42,018 --> 00:22:43,749
- Arizona boy.
- Mmm-hmm.

413
00:22:43,751 --> 00:22:46,886
Dad had a midlife crisis,
I think.

414
00:22:46,888 --> 00:22:48,821
So I've been told.

415
00:22:48,823 --> 00:22:50,856
Made his way to Arizona,
started working

416
00:22:50,858 --> 00:22:54,560
for this family
on a pecan ranch.

417
00:22:54,562 --> 00:22:56,531
- A pecan ranch?
- Yeah.

418
00:22:58,434 --> 00:23:01,233
Knocked up
the family's daughter.

419
00:23:01,235 --> 00:23:03,002
She was just shy of 18.

420
00:23:03,004 --> 00:23:05,305
Uh-oh.

421
00:23:05,307 --> 00:23:06,839
That's when
I came into the picture.

422
00:23:06,841 --> 00:23:08,407
Okay.
The son of an 18-year-old.

423
00:23:08,409 --> 00:23:09,643
Yeah.

424
00:23:09,645 --> 00:23:13,113
Well, she died at childbirth.

425
00:23:13,115 --> 00:23:15,348
- Then, my dad...
- I'm sorry.

426
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:17,650
He, uh...

427
00:23:17,652 --> 00:23:20,019
He died when I was 13,

428
00:23:20,021 --> 00:23:24,089
so I guess my brother would
tell you that he raised me,

429
00:23:24,091 --> 00:23:26,792
but I don't know. I don't know
who was raising who.

430
00:23:26,794 --> 00:23:32,100
Just 127 acres of nuts,
Navajo, and nowhere to go.

431
00:23:38,373 --> 00:23:42,444
<i>♪ Tell me something, boy</i>

432
00:23:46,214 --> 00:23:51,619

00:24:08,303 --> 00:24:09,970
Is that me?

436
00:24:09,972 --> 00:24:12,472
That's you.

437
00:24:12,474 --> 00:24:14,944
- Did you just write that now?
- Yeah.

438
00:24:16,011 --> 00:24:17,546
It's pretty good.

439
00:24:19,246 --> 00:24:23,585

00:24:28,690 --> 00:24:35,831

442
00:24:50,613 --> 00:24:54,150
I started writing this song
the other day,

443
00:25:01,021 --> 00:25:05,991
and maybe that could work,
like as a chorus or something.

444
00:25:05,993 --> 00:25:08,696
I have to think
if I can remember it. Uh...

445
00:25:09,697 --> 00:25:14,136

00:25:44,698 --> 00:25:46,701
Holy shit.

452
00:25:49,370 --> 00:25:50,905
What is this?

453
00:25:52,441 --> 00:25:54,477
Was this supposed to help me?

454
00:26:03,318 --> 00:26:04,953
Can I tell you a secret?

455
00:26:09,057 --> 00:26:11,894
I think
you might be a songwriter.

456
00:26:17,065 --> 00:26:19,902
But don't worry,
I won't tell anybody.

457
00:26:23,137 --> 00:26:25,704
But I'm not very good
at keeping secrets.

458
00:26:32,614 --> 00:26:34,783
You're a real gentleman.

459
00:26:36,318 --> 00:26:37,685
I think.

460
00:26:49,897 --> 00:26:51,730
Thank you, sir.
It's right here, on the right.

461
00:26:51,732 --> 00:26:52,965
- Right there?
- Which one?

462
00:26:52,967 --> 00:26:55,001
- This one.
- Oh, yeah.

463
00:26:55,003 --> 00:26:56,568
What's all this?

464
00:26:56,570 --> 00:27:00,506
Oh, it's my dad.
It's a long story.

465
00:27:00,508 --> 00:27:02,275
What's he, a sheikh?

466
00:27:03,744 --> 00:27:06,211
No, he's a driver.

467
00:27:06,213 --> 00:27:10,051
Hey, I got a gig.
You wanna come?

468
00:27:10,919 --> 00:27:11,984
When?

469
00:27:11,986 --> 00:27:13,153
We're headed
to the airport now.

470
00:27:13,155 --> 00:27:15,321
- Tonight.
- Tonight? No, I can't.

471
00:27:15,323 --> 00:27:18,458
I gotta go to work later.
I gotta go to bed.

472
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:21,626
Who's gonna take care of your
hand? I messed it up, or...

473
00:27:21,628 --> 00:27:23,063
- Me.
- No, no!

474
00:27:23,065 --> 00:27:24,631
- I'll take care of my hand.
- It's my fault.

475
00:27:24,633 --> 00:27:26,032
- I took you to that place.
- That's okay.

476
00:27:26,034 --> 00:27:27,702
No, listen. Hey!

477
00:27:29,104 --> 00:27:32,571
- You have my number.
- Okay. All right.

478
00:27:37,244 --> 00:27:38,478
Hey.

479
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,446
What?

480
00:27:40,448 --> 00:27:43,482
I just wanted to take
another look at you.

481
00:28:05,607 --> 00:28:07,876
Oh, maybe I fucked that up.

482
00:28:08,476 --> 00:28:10,810
No.

483
00:28:10,812 --> 00:28:13,313
- Hi, Dad.
- Pretty late, pretty late.

484
00:28:13,315 --> 00:28:14,847
- Oh, is it late?
- Yeah.

485
00:28:14,849 --> 00:28:16,718
Look at you, you don't even
know where you're walking.

486
00:28:17,819 --> 00:28:19,685
- Come on.
- Well, I wanna go to bed.

487
00:28:19,687 --> 00:28:21,086
No, come in for two minutes.

488
00:28:21,088 --> 00:28:24,025
It's Wolfie's birthday,
come on!

489
00:28:24,859 --> 00:28:26,558
- Two minutes!
- Okay.

490
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:28,394
- Wolfie!
- Yeah, sweetheart?

491
00:28:28,396 --> 00:28:29,929
Who was the guy in the car?

492
00:28:29,931 --> 00:28:31,029
I don't know
what you're talking about.

493
00:28:31,031 --> 00:28:32,432
- Hey, Ally.
- How's it goin'?

494
00:28:32,434 --> 00:28:34,968
- Happy birthday.
- Hey, "happy birthday"?

495
00:28:34,970 --> 00:28:36,536
- Yeah.
- It's not my birthday.

496
00:28:36,538 --> 00:28:37,703
What do you mean?

497
00:28:37,705 --> 00:28:38,971
- Come on.
- No, I was just saying...

498
00:28:38,973 --> 00:28:41,807
What the hell happened
in here? My God!

499
00:28:41,809 --> 00:28:43,375
This place is a mess!

500
00:28:43,377 --> 00:28:45,112
Starting gate
is Shipazo Gito

501
00:28:45,114 --> 00:28:46,945
and bad beat is Wario Peito.

502
00:28:46,947 --> 00:28:48,647
What's going on?
You leave the butter out.

503
00:28:48,649 --> 00:28:50,150
Who the hell's
betting on horses

504
00:28:50,152 --> 00:28:52,084
- at breakfast time in Japan?
- It's not

505
00:28:52,086 --> 00:28:53,619
- breakfast time in Japan.
- They're loading!

506
00:28:53,621 --> 00:28:55,387
- Joe, we're going. Come on!
- You guys are crazy!

507
00:28:55,389 --> 00:28:56,990
Have a sizable
investment on this thing here.

508
00:28:56,992 --> 00:28:59,025
What did I say about smoking
in this house?

509
00:28:59,027 --> 00:29:00,759
- Outside!
- Who are you?

510
00:29:00,761 --> 00:29:02,095
Who am I?
It's my house.

511
00:29:02,097 --> 00:29:03,863
I know it's your house.
But you smoke too.

512
00:29:03,865 --> 00:29:05,298
- All right, forget it.
- Okay, good.

513
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:07,403
Sweetheart, you're happy here,
aren't you?

514
00:29:08,336 --> 00:29:09,435
I'm happy, Dad.

515
00:29:09,437 --> 00:29:11,738
I'm just saying,
she's got no space.

516
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:13,940
- What are you saying?
- Wait a minute, sweetheart.

517
00:29:13,942 --> 00:29:15,340
- I'm saying she's got no space.
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

518
00:29:15,342 --> 00:29:17,644
I want my friends
to look at you.

519
00:29:17,646 --> 00:29:19,246
Take a good look.

520
00:29:19,248 --> 00:29:23,184
With a voice like from heaven,
but you know what?

521
00:29:26,088 --> 00:29:28,988
It's not always the best
singers that make it.

522
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:32,057
You know?
I knew a couple of guys

523
00:29:32,059 --> 00:29:34,626
could sing Sinatra
under the table.

524
00:29:34,628 --> 00:29:37,430
But Frank, he'd come on stage
with the blue eyes,

525
00:29:37,432 --> 00:29:40,799
the sharkskin suit,
the patent leather shoes...

526
00:29:40,801 --> 00:29:43,903
He becomes Frank Sinatra.

527
00:29:43,905 --> 00:29:47,539
And everybody else,
all these other guys

528
00:29:47,541 --> 00:29:51,280
that really got it,
that really have it inside,

529
00:29:52,579 --> 00:29:54,449
just a bunch of nobodies.

530
00:29:55,582 --> 00:29:58,317
Okay. Everybody, let's go.

531
00:29:58,319 --> 00:29:59,719
Time for work.

532
00:30:11,432 --> 00:30:13,798
Unfortunately,
you keep blasting the hearing,

533
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,167
it's not gonna come back.

534
00:30:15,169 --> 00:30:16,736
I think it's time
we reconsider

535
00:30:16,738 --> 00:30:18,171
- the inner monitors.
- Mmm-hmm.

536
00:30:18,173 --> 00:30:19,506
We've talked about
that with Bobby

537
00:30:19,508 --> 00:30:21,272
- a couple of weeks ago.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

538
00:30:21,274 --> 00:30:23,242
If we put the inner moles in,
we can actually use those

539
00:30:23,244 --> 00:30:25,112
to amplify the high
frequencies.

540
00:30:25,114 --> 00:30:26,613
- Yeah, okay, that sounds great.
- Cut down the sound.

541
00:30:26,615 --> 00:30:28,147
- Yeah, you're right. Yeah.
- I'm gonna talk to Bobby,

542
00:30:28,149 --> 00:30:29,448
and we're gonna
get something set up.

543
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:30,683
Sold. I'm sold.

544
00:30:30,685 --> 00:30:32,818
- All right, Jack.
- Yeah, call Bobby.

545
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:34,386
Stubborn son of a bitch.

546
00:30:34,388 --> 00:30:36,055
<i>All right, let's get
ready. 1, 2, 3, 4.</i>

547
00:30:46,367 --> 00:30:50,838
<i>♪ Killing me, baby,
with the things you do</i>

548
00:30:51,905 --> 00:30:55,007
<i>♪ You put me in the ground ♪</i>

549
00:30:55,009 --> 00:30:56,942
<i>We're trying...</i>

550
00:30:56,944 --> 00:30:58,847
You gotta put 'em in, man.

551
00:31:02,117 --> 00:31:03,549
I told you,
I can't wear those things.

552
00:31:03,551 --> 00:31:05,151
When I wear 'em,
it's just in my head,

553
00:31:05,153 --> 00:31:06,818
and I need to be here
with everybody else.

554
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:08,654
The doctor said
it's the only way

555
00:31:08,656 --> 00:31:10,923
to manage this thing, Jack.

556
00:31:10,925 --> 00:31:13,124
You're not gonna
get back what you lost.

557
00:31:13,126 --> 00:31:15,862
It's the only way we can
manage what you still got.

558
00:31:15,864 --> 00:31:17,529
Oh, wow.

559
00:31:17,531 --> 00:31:19,833
I think
we're managing pretty good.

560
00:31:19,835 --> 00:31:21,970
What do you
want me to do?

561
00:31:25,373 --> 00:31:27,073
<i>The door's wide open
if you wanna go.</i>

562
00:31:27,075 --> 00:31:29,044
You know what?
Don't start that shit.

563
00:31:32,146 --> 00:31:35,347
Show a little fucking pride
in what you're doing, buddy.

564
00:31:35,349 --> 00:31:38,417
I just wanna know if she's
on her way or not, that's all.

565
00:31:38,419 --> 00:31:40,388
Who's coming?

566
00:31:41,655 --> 00:31:43,888
What the fuck?

567
00:31:43,890 --> 00:31:45,791
- Who's here?
- I have no idea.

568
00:31:45,793 --> 00:31:47,192
He won't tell me.

569
00:31:49,563 --> 00:31:50,997
- Hi, Ally.
- Hi.

570
00:31:50,999 --> 00:31:52,565
- I'm Phil. We met last night.
- Yeah, I remember.

571
00:31:52,567 --> 00:31:54,933
Jack sent me to pick you up
and take you to the gig.

572
00:31:54,935 --> 00:31:56,702
Oh, my God. Um...

573
00:31:56,704 --> 00:31:59,338
But I gotta work. I can't go.

574
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:00,807
He's really
looking forward to this.

575
00:32:00,809 --> 00:32:02,575
I really appreciate that,
but, uh...

576
00:32:02,577 --> 00:32:04,143
I can't leave,
so I'll be in my car

577
00:32:04,145 --> 00:32:05,545
right down the street.

578
00:32:05,547 --> 00:32:07,212
Please tell him,
"Thank you, but no thank you."

579
00:32:07,214 --> 00:32:08,948
Okay? Say it just like that.

580
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:10,015
Wait a minute, Ally.
What're you doing?

581
00:32:10,017 --> 00:32:11,317
The fuck is that shit?

582
00:32:11,319 --> 00:32:12,719
- This is crazy.
- What are you doing?

583
00:32:12,721 --> 00:32:14,320
- This is great.
- What the hell's going on?

584
00:32:14,322 --> 00:32:16,521
Look, a guy like that
invites you to a show...

585
00:32:16,523 --> 00:32:18,857
- It could be a great opportunity.
- Dad, don't start with me.

586
00:32:18,859 --> 00:32:20,559
- Don't start!
- Listen, listen!

587
00:32:20,561 --> 00:32:23,061
Does he know you sing at all?
Did he hear anything from you?

588
00:32:23,063 --> 00:32:24,497
Dad, I gotta go to work.

589
00:32:24,499 --> 00:32:25,765
This could be
the opportunity of a lifetime.

590
00:32:25,767 --> 00:32:27,267
I don't have the same disease

591
00:32:27,269 --> 00:32:28,701
that you have, Dad.
You get around celebrities,

592
00:32:28,703 --> 00:32:30,536
and it's like
they're gonna rub off on you.

593
00:32:30,538 --> 00:32:32,070
What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?

594
00:32:32,072 --> 00:32:33,306
"Oh, you know who I drove
the other day?"

595
00:32:33,308 --> 00:32:34,374
Why are you talking
about that?

596
00:32:34,376 --> 00:32:35,875
Like magic, now you're famous.

597
00:32:35,877 --> 00:32:37,376
And you're not.
It's not magic, Dad.

598
00:32:37,378 --> 00:32:38,544
Sweetheart.

599
00:32:38,546 --> 00:32:40,949
He's a drunk!
You know all about drunks.

600
00:32:49,890 --> 00:32:52,290
Sweetheart, he's still there.

601
00:32:52,292 --> 00:32:53,893
Yo, so you fucking hit a cop?

602
00:32:53,895 --> 00:32:55,595
Yeah, he was being
an asshole to Jack,

603
00:32:55,597 --> 00:32:58,130
so I fucking popped him
in the face.

604
00:32:58,132 --> 00:32:59,397
Yo, that is so gangster.

605
00:32:59,399 --> 00:33:01,201
So, then we ended up
in a parking lot,

606
00:33:01,203 --> 00:33:02,701
and he was putting peas
around my hand to fix my hand.

607
00:33:02,703 --> 00:33:04,569
And then he was singing,
and I was singing.

608
00:33:04,571 --> 00:33:06,271
I don't know
what the hell's going on.

609
00:33:06,273 --> 00:33:08,040
But now he's got his driver
following me around.

610
00:33:08,042 --> 00:33:09,342
Wait, he's been following you

611
00:33:09,344 --> 00:33:10,743
from your house
all the way to work?

612
00:33:10,745 --> 00:33:12,011
- Yes! It's crazy!
- You're fucking late again.

613
00:33:12,013 --> 00:33:13,613
I'm what?

614
00:33:13,615 --> 00:33:15,483
I said you're late!

615
00:33:23,925 --> 00:33:25,293
Are we doing this?

616
00:33:30,964 --> 00:33:32,597
Hey, Bryan, I'm out.

617
00:33:32,599 --> 00:33:33,598
Find somebody else.

618
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,101
Bryan, I'll be back.
I promise.

619
00:33:35,103 --> 00:33:37,068
- <i>Papo,</i> I promise.
- See ya. I won't.

620
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,839
- Did you see Bryan's face?
- Oh, shit!

621
00:33:40,841 --> 00:33:42,610
Hey, great!
Let's do this.

622
00:33:43,311 --> 00:33:44,612
Let's go.

623
00:33:45,346 --> 00:33:47,747
What are we doing?

624
00:33:47,749 --> 00:33:49,915
You know,
if I didn't know Jack,

625
00:33:49,917 --> 00:33:51,817
I would call you a stalker.

626
00:33:53,021 --> 00:33:55,257
Yeah, sorry about that.

627
00:33:56,758 --> 00:33:59,294
Yes, man!

628
00:34:02,864 --> 00:34:06,231
Lay on that couch right now!
I'm gonna take my shoes off.

629
00:34:06,233 --> 00:34:07,666
- Oh, my God!
- This is nice.

630
00:34:07,668 --> 00:34:09,134
How this shit works?

631
00:34:09,136 --> 00:34:11,303
- They just told you no.
- Oh, okay. I'm so sorry.

632
00:34:11,305 --> 00:34:13,040
Oh, shit!

633
00:34:16,176 --> 00:34:17,810
I could get used to this shit.

634
00:34:17,812 --> 00:34:19,044
You need to date
more rock stars,

635
00:34:19,046 --> 00:34:20,145
baby girl,
you know what I'm saying?

636
00:34:20,147 --> 00:34:21,580
We're not dating.

637
00:34:32,093 --> 00:34:33,993
Hi, Ally. I'm Gail.

638
00:34:33,995 --> 00:34:35,560
- <i>Hi.</i>
- <i>Hi.</i>

639
00:34:35,562 --> 00:34:37,096
Oh, you guys can leave your bags.
We'll grab 'em in a sec.

640
00:34:37,098 --> 00:34:38,430
- Ready?
- Oh. Okay, sure.

641
00:34:38,432 --> 00:34:40,301
- Okay. Yeah.
- Thanks.

642
00:34:44,939 --> 00:34:46,473
Did you have
a good trip?

643
00:34:46,475 --> 00:34:47,506
Yeah.

644
00:34:50,044 --> 00:34:51,576
Passes.

645
00:34:51,578 --> 00:34:53,345
- Oh, thank you.
- Put 'em around your necks.

646
00:34:53,347 --> 00:34:55,649
Ear plugs. You'll need these,
it's loud up there.

647
00:34:57,218 --> 00:34:58,718
Yeah, I got 'em.
We're coming in.

648
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,789

to the side stage.

- It's all good.
- I'm so sorry.

652
00:35:07,995 --> 00:35:09,227
This place is so big.
I'm just...

Oh, watch yourself.

- I'm good. Hi!

676
00:37:47,888 --> 00:37:49,055
It's so good to see you.

677
00:37:49,057 --> 00:37:50,355
How are you?
It was so good.

678
00:37:50,357 --> 00:37:51,591
Everything all right?
The trip was fine?

679
00:37:51,593 --> 00:37:53,024
- Yeah, yeah.
- Phil was all right?

680
00:37:53,026 --> 00:37:54,826
- Didn't bother you at all?
- Gail was so nice.

681
00:37:54,828 --> 00:37:57,062
So, listen, we're gonna sing
that song, all right?

682
00:37:57,064 --> 00:37:59,298
I did an arrangement,
it was kind of not so great,

683
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:00,799
but maybe you could
just stick with it.

684
00:38:00,801 --> 00:38:02,234
No, I can't do that.
I'm sorry. No, Jack, please.

685
00:38:02,236 --> 00:38:03,535
Yeah, you're coming.
Here we go.

686
00:38:03,537 --> 00:38:05,472
It's not funny.
Jack, don't fuck around.

687
00:38:06,441 --> 00:38:09,140
All you gotta do is trust me.

688
00:38:09,142 --> 00:38:10,911
That's all you gotta do.

689
00:38:13,247 --> 00:38:15,550
I'm gonna
sing it either way, so...

690
00:38:26,627 --> 00:38:27,926
Steve...

691
00:38:27,928 --> 00:38:30,895
You lost your mind. Okay.

692
00:38:30,897 --> 00:38:33,598
- You have to go sing.

Pretty fucking good.

728
00:42:07,814 --> 00:42:09,314
You see, the way
the guitar just started and...

729
00:42:09,316 --> 00:42:10,750
I thought maybe
I set it in the wrong key,

730
00:42:10,752 --> 00:42:12,017
and then the tempo
was too fast.

731
00:42:12,019 --> 00:42:13,651
No, it was
so beautiful, and...

Just give me one second.

Where's the fucking...

749
00:43:19,287 --> 00:43:20,288
Okay.

00:43:49,182 --> 00:43:50,184
Hey.

00:43:52,252 --> 00:43:53,484
Jack?

752
00:43:53,486 --> 00:43:55,220
I don't know, wake him up.

753
00:43:55,222 --> 00:43:56,622
I can't wake him up.
He's drunk.

754
00:43:56,624 --> 00:43:57,723
Yes, you can!

755
00:43:57,725 --> 00:43:58,991
Shake your titties in his face

756
00:43:58,993 --> 00:44:00,792

and just fucking...

757
00:44:00,794 --> 00:44:02,426
You know what I'm saying?
Take two shots and...

758
00:44:02,428 --> 00:44:04,997
Thank you so much for your help.
You are so helpful.

759
00:44:04,999 --> 00:44:07,066
Let me know how it goes, baby.

760
00:44:15,176 --> 00:44:16,578
Go home, pal.

761
00:44:24,484 --> 00:44:26,019
He's out.

762
00:44:28,356 --> 00:44:31,292
You think maybe
he drinks a bit much?

763
00:44:34,961 --> 00:44:37,264
Sweetie, you have no idea.

764
00:44:38,566 --> 00:44:40,165
Tell you one thing, though.

765
00:44:40,167 --> 00:44:43,136
He's never brought a girl
onstage before.

766
00:44:45,138 --> 00:44:46,937
And it's been
a long, long time

767
00:44:46,939 --> 00:44:49,374
since he played like that.

768
00:44:49,376 --> 00:44:51,613
Well, that's good to know.

769
00:45:55,209 --> 00:45:57,142
One time,
my brother came home,

770
00:45:57,144 --> 00:45:58,642
I was playing on this upright

771
00:45:58,644 --> 00:46:00,379
we used to
always have in our den.

772
00:46:00,381 --> 00:46:02,180
And I was in my own world.

773
00:46:02,182 --> 00:46:03,848
No one was ever home,
and then he comes home

774
00:46:03,850 --> 00:46:06,517
to take care of my dad,
who was sick.

775
00:46:06,519 --> 00:46:09,254
And he's sittin' there,
and he's looking at me.

776
00:46:09,256 --> 00:46:10,788
I swear to God,
he looked at me

777
00:46:10,790 --> 00:46:12,924
like I was special
or something,

778
00:46:12,926 --> 00:46:15,026
and it just kind
of filled me up.

779
00:46:15,028 --> 00:46:17,428
I should've never
told you that. I don't know.

780
00:46:17,430 --> 00:46:18,730
Why?

781
00:46:18,732 --> 00:46:19,932
'Cause it's embarrassing.
I don't know.

782
00:46:19,934 --> 00:46:21,533
It's so sweet.

783
00:46:21,535 --> 00:46:23,401
'Cause you're nothing like
my brother, let me just say.

784
00:46:23,403 --> 00:46:24,937
Yeah, I don't look
like your brother?

785
00:46:24,939 --> 00:46:27,939
He's a fucking
old man, okay.

786
00:46:27,941 --> 00:46:30,341
My dad had me
when he was 63 years old.

787
00:46:30,343 --> 00:46:31,676
63 years old?

788
00:46:31,678 --> 00:46:33,747
And we have
different mothers, so...

789
00:46:36,117 --> 00:46:39,183
What's that number down here?

790
00:46:39,185 --> 00:46:41,653
That is how many people
looked at it.

791
00:46:41,655 --> 00:46:43,154
Get the fuck out of here.

792
00:46:43,156 --> 00:46:44,656
How do they know
how many people looked at it?

793
00:46:44,658 --> 00:46:47,426
I think it's... They call it
an algorithm, or...

794
00:46:47,428 --> 00:46:48,826
What's an algorithm?

795
00:46:48,828 --> 00:46:50,462
It's like a beat.

796
00:46:50,464 --> 00:46:52,897
- A beat?
- Yeah. Yeah.

797
00:46:52,899 --> 00:46:54,433

00:50:03,022 --> 00:50:04,656
You avoid your home?

854
00:50:04,658 --> 00:50:05,660
I don't know.

855
00:50:06,892 --> 00:50:08,695
It's like the hot air

856
00:50:12,732 --> 00:50:15,366
and the history, I don't know.

857
00:50:15,368 --> 00:50:17,234
Bought the ranch, though,
I grew up on,

858
00:50:17,236 --> 00:50:20,337
gave it to my brother.

859
00:50:20,339 --> 00:50:22,140
We buried Dad there, and so
I just wanted to make sure

860
00:50:22,142 --> 00:50:25,644
that nobody paved
over his grave

861
00:50:25,646 --> 00:50:28,013
- or any of that kind of shit.
- Is it around here?

862
00:50:28,015 --> 00:50:29,446
It's not far.

863
00:50:29,448 --> 00:50:32,052
Why don't we just go there?
It's nearby.

864
00:50:44,464 --> 00:50:46,100
Jack?

865
00:50:54,941 --> 00:50:56,207
Yeah, if he shows up.

866
00:50:56,209 --> 00:50:57,408
These guys have been
vamping out there

867
00:50:57,410 --> 00:50:59,011
for a fucking half an hour.

868
00:50:59,013 --> 00:51:01,145
It's time to fucking get on.

869
00:51:01,147 --> 00:51:02,482
Don't you
get tired of being...

870
00:51:04,883 --> 00:51:07,352
You sold Dad's ranch.

871
00:51:07,354 --> 00:51:10,624
They turned it into
a fucking wind farm!

872
00:51:13,959 --> 00:51:16,396
I bought that for you.

873
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:21,299
Where's his grave?

874
00:51:21,301 --> 00:51:24,069
He washed away
in a fucking storm.

875
00:51:24,071 --> 00:51:26,507
His grave isn't there anymore.

876
00:51:27,673 --> 00:51:30,408
I told you,
but you were fucking drunk.

877
00:51:30,410 --> 00:51:32,444
You were fucking loaded

878
00:51:32,446 --> 00:51:35,482
and already pissing yourself
a swan song.

879
00:51:37,850 --> 00:51:39,852
Fuck if you shed a tear
for that piece of shit

880
00:51:39,854 --> 00:51:43,256
you idolize for
no goddamn fucking reason.

881
00:51:46,892 --> 00:51:49,262
All Dad ever did for you

882
00:51:50,464 --> 00:51:53,798
was make you
his fucking drinking buddy.

883
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:55,966
And you'd be right there with
him if he was still alive,

884
00:51:55,968 --> 00:51:58,238
and you fucking know it.

885
00:52:00,841 --> 00:52:02,408
What did you think,

886
00:52:02,410 --> 00:52:05,477
that I was gonna fucking
take care of it

887
00:52:05,479 --> 00:52:07,446
while I'm fucking
cradling your ass

888
00:52:07,448 --> 00:52:09,783
all over the goddamn world.

889
00:52:15,990 --> 00:52:17,191
Yeah.

890
00:52:19,426 --> 00:52:20,857
That's a good excuse.

891
00:52:20,859 --> 00:52:22,160
Raising a little brother,

892
00:52:22,162 --> 00:52:23,261
so you don't have
to deal with the fact

893
00:52:23,263 --> 00:52:25,796
that you were no fucking good.

894
00:52:25,798 --> 00:52:29,402
If I was no good, why'd
you steal my fucking voice?

895
00:52:30,903 --> 00:52:32,236
Huh?

896
00:52:32,238 --> 00:52:34,240
'Cause you had
nothing to fucking say.

897
00:52:38,745 --> 00:52:42,316
You were too proud to sing
any of the songs I ever wrote.

898
00:52:45,151 --> 00:52:47,285
Well, I got something
to say now, pal.

899
00:52:47,287 --> 00:52:50,156
I'm done being
your fucking errand boy.

900
00:52:52,593 --> 00:52:53,761
I quit.

901
00:53:00,133 --> 00:53:01,966
Yeah, my voice
just got up on me

902
00:53:01,968 --> 00:53:03,801
a few months ago and

903
00:53:03,803 --> 00:53:07,805
another shot of steroids
is better safe than sorry.

904
00:53:07,807 --> 00:53:10,810
Thank you for that,
and yeah, we should be good.

905
00:53:26,593 --> 00:53:27,595
Hey.

906
00:53:29,763 --> 00:53:30,898

What you have right now
goes way beyond just this.

999
01:00:42,595 --> 01:00:43,995
There's people
who need to hear

1000

what you have
to say musically.

1001
01:00:46,832 --> 01:00:48,265

1002
01:00:48,267 --> 01:00:50,901

1003
01:00:50,903 --> 01:00:53,270
I think you have it all. I do.

1004
01:00:53,272 --> 01:00:55,175
And the question to you is,
"What do you want?"

1005
01:00:57,042 --> 01:01:00,343
I'm in that position, to put
you wherever you want to be.

1006
01:01:00,345 --> 01:01:03,649
I don't... I don't have...

1007
01:01:06,419 --> 01:01:08,653
I gotta talk to Jack.

1008
01:01:08,655 --> 01:01:10,654
He said
he thought Interscope Records

1009
01:01:10,656 --> 01:01:12,355
might really wanna sign me,

1010
01:01:12,357 --> 01:01:15,459
and he said that he has
this wonderful studio

1011
01:01:15,461 --> 01:01:17,227
with a beautiful live room.

1012
01:01:17,229 --> 01:01:19,564
And these amazing producers
he wants to bring in

1013
01:01:19,566 --> 01:01:22,000
to record my songs.

1014
01:01:22,002 --> 01:01:23,935
And he loves
"Look What I've Found."

1015
01:01:23,937 --> 01:01:26,136
Remember the song
we did in the diner?

1016
01:01:26,138 --> 01:01:27,604
Remember,
when we were driving?

1017
01:01:27,606 --> 01:01:28,908
Yeah.

1018
01:01:29,642 --> 01:01:31,008
Yeah?

1019
01:01:31,010 --> 01:01:33,410
I mean, it was so nice
talking to him,

1020
01:01:33,412 --> 01:01:35,747
and he really believes in me.

1021
01:01:37,249 --> 01:01:39,417
- You all right, Jack?
- He's okay. He's fine.

1022
01:01:39,419 --> 01:01:41,088
He does this all the time.

1023
01:01:42,421 --> 01:01:44,090
Hey, Jack.

1024
01:01:49,328 --> 01:01:50,330
Thanks.

1025
01:01:52,198 --> 01:01:53,399
What's going on?

1026
01:01:54,667 --> 01:01:56,036
Hmm?

1027
01:01:56,970 --> 01:01:58,372
What're you doing?

1028
01:02:08,847 --> 01:02:11,283
You jealous fuck.

1029
01:02:13,653 --> 01:02:15,453
I'm so happy for you.

1030
01:02:15,455 --> 01:02:17,687
Oh, you are?

1031
01:02:17,689 --> 01:02:21,058
Oh! Jackson!

1032
01:02:21,060 --> 01:02:23,130
Oh, my God!

1033
01:02:25,231 --> 01:02:27,400
Jack. Stop!

1034
01:02:29,635 --> 01:02:32,672
Why're you so jealous,
boy? Hmm?

1035
01:02:34,707 --> 01:02:36,607
What're you doing?

1036
01:02:36,609 --> 01:02:38,912
What's wrong? You upset?

1037
01:02:41,080 --> 01:02:43,446
You want me to
make you less...

1038
01:02:43,448 --> 01:02:45,751
I know, do you wanna play?
Okay, let's play.

1039
01:02:49,455 --> 01:02:51,488
What the hell is this?

1040
01:02:51,490 --> 01:02:53,491
- I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.
- <i>No, you're fine. You're all fine.</i>

1041
01:02:53,493 --> 01:02:55,993
- <i>You sound great, okay?</i>
- <i>You're doing great.</i>

1042
01:02:55,995 --> 01:02:58,064
<i>We'll do it again.
I'm gonna cue you in.</i>

1043
01:03:00,633 --> 01:03:03,033
- One, two...
- <i>♪ I'm alone in my house ♪</i>

1044
01:03:03,035 --> 01:03:04,769
One second, one second.
Listen to my cue.

1045
01:03:04,771 --> 01:03:06,136
We'll come right in, okay?

1046
01:03:06,138 --> 01:03:08,839
<i>So, should...
Well, uh...</i>

1047
01:03:08,841 --> 01:03:11,375
<i>I'm sorry, but will I
sing in the beginning?</i>

1048
01:03:11,377 --> 01:03:12,977
So you're gonna
hear the second line,

1049
01:03:12,979 --> 01:03:14,712
and then I wanna
start recording.

1050
01:03:14,714 --> 01:03:18,649
I think I got an idea that
might help out, all right?

1051
01:03:18,651 --> 01:03:19,950
Yeah, please. Be my guest.

1052
01:03:19,952 --> 01:03:22,086
That was really good
up to that point.

1053
01:03:22,088 --> 01:03:23,756
- I'm just gonna go in there for a second, all right?
- All right, Jack.

1054
01:03:24,990 --> 01:03:26,357
I've never sang
with a track before.

1055
01:03:26,359 --> 01:03:28,058
I think it's because
you need your piano.

1056
01:03:28,060 --> 01:03:29,593
I think if you're playing it
and singing it...

1057
01:03:29,595 --> 01:03:31,729
Yeah, I always play it
on the piano. I'll be fine.

1058
01:03:31,731 --> 01:03:34,198
I'm just gonna have them fly
one in, and we'll try it there

1059
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:36,470
- and see where it goes.
- You think that's okay?

1060
01:03:37,437 --> 01:03:38,569
Okay. Thank you.

1061
01:03:38,571 --> 01:03:39,770
I got you.
You're doing great.

1062
01:03:39,772 --> 01:03:41,238
- You okay?
- No, I'm so nervous.

1063
01:03:41,240 --> 01:03:43,843
- You look so beautiful.
- Thank you.

1064
01:03:44,644 --> 01:03:45,846
Thank you.

1065
01:03:56,155 --> 01:03:59,091
<i>♪ I'm alone in my house</i>

1066
01:04:01,093 --> 01:04:03,963
<i>♪ I'm out on the town</i>

1067
01:04:06,598 --> 01:04:09,700

1071
01:04:26,051 --> 01:04:28,151
<i>♪ But look what I found ♪</i>

1072
01:04:28,153 --> 01:04:31,921
Oh, so you guys have already
met the new girl, have you?

1073
01:04:31,923 --> 01:04:34,158
- Rez! What's the plan?
- What's up?

1074
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:36,326
Yo, thanks for doing this,
man. I appreciate it.

1075
01:04:36,328 --> 01:04:39,263
This is pop music, kids.
We have a battle to do, okay?

1076
01:04:39,265 --> 01:04:41,432
You are the troops,
so if I call you troops,

1077
01:04:41,434 --> 01:04:43,767
just know that
we're going into battle.

1078
01:04:43,769 --> 01:04:44,968
What is my lyrics, Ally?

1079
01:04:44,970 --> 01:04:46,937
<i>♪ Just don't keep me waiting</i>

1080
01:04:46,939 --> 01:04:48,738
Yes! Again, give me that.

1081
01:04:48,740 --> 01:04:51,008
<i>♪ When I can't inspire myself</i>

1082
01:04:51,010 --> 01:04:54,611
- Breathe! Yes!
- <i>♪ I need you to provide for me ♪</i>

1083
01:04:54,613 --> 01:04:57,982
This is just fine-tuning
and creating an image.

1084
01:04:57,984 --> 01:04:59,316
I know,
I just don't wanna lose

1085
01:04:59,318 --> 01:05:02,553
the part of me
that's talented.

1086
01:05:02,555 --> 01:05:04,321
I'm not gonna let you
lose that piece.

1087
01:05:04,323 --> 01:05:05,890
I'm not gonna let you
lose that piece.

1088
01:05:05,892 --> 01:05:07,294
Okay.

1089
01:05:11,698 --> 01:05:14,298
What are we gonna do with you?

1090
01:05:14,300 --> 01:05:16,399
What are we gonna do with...
Oh, he's beautiful!

1091
01:05:16,401 --> 01:05:18,035
"You can't send me back.
I'm too cute."

1092
01:05:18,037 --> 01:05:20,071
- Hey, he's got your eyelashes.
- Mmm-hmm.

1093
01:05:20,073 --> 01:05:24,207
He does. He's got
your eyelashes. Hey, bud!

1094
01:05:24,209 --> 01:05:27,044
This has never been done
before, just so you know.

1095
01:05:27,046 --> 01:05:30,147
It actually has
been done before.

1096
01:05:30,149 --> 01:05:32,216
Would you please...

1097
01:05:32,218 --> 01:05:34,151
Please. Do it for me.

1098
01:05:34,153 --> 01:05:37,457
No, I can't in the water.

1099
01:06:05,718 --> 01:06:07,620
You comin' with me to Memphis?

1100
01:06:09,955 --> 01:06:13,457
- What are you talkin' about?
- I gotta go do this, um...

1101
01:06:13,459 --> 01:06:16,061
You know,
it's one of those paid things.

1102
01:06:16,896 --> 01:06:18,997
Soul-crushing work, really,

1103
01:06:18,999 --> 01:06:20,298
but it's just kind of never

1104
01:06:20,300 --> 01:06:21,765
what I thought
I'd wind up doing, maybe.

1105
01:06:21,767 --> 01:06:24,769
I don't know, but...

1106
01:06:24,771 --> 01:06:27,470
I've made peace with it,
though.

1107
01:06:27,472 --> 01:06:30,674
Anyway, if you wanna come,
I thought

1108
01:06:30,676 --> 01:06:33,142
we'd have a laugh,
at the very least.

1109
01:06:33,144 --> 01:06:35,078
Rez wants to
keep me here because,

1110
01:06:35,080 --> 01:06:37,180
you know,
they rushed out the single,

1111
01:06:37,182 --> 01:06:38,649
and they were so excited

1112
01:06:38,651 --> 01:06:40,383
that they want me to
finish the album.

1113
01:06:40,385 --> 01:06:43,854
- So I'm working on that.
- Listen to what you're saying.

1114
01:06:43,856 --> 01:06:47,091
Listen to what you just said.

1115
01:06:47,093 --> 01:06:48,625
People wanna hear
what you have to say.

1116
01:06:48,627 --> 01:06:50,794
- That's the stuff right there.
- I know. I can't...

1117
01:06:50,796 --> 01:06:53,633
Hey, hey. Take it in.

1118
01:06:55,568 --> 01:06:57,000
Thank you, by the way.

1119
01:06:57,002 --> 01:06:58,435
Thank you for what?

1120
01:06:58,437 --> 01:07:00,136
Giving me a home.

1121
01:07:00,138 --> 01:07:02,408
This place never
felt like one before.

1122
01:07:39,812 --> 01:07:42,111
Oh, fuck.

1123
01:07:42,113 --> 01:07:44,216
Jack, you okay?

1124
01:07:45,118 --> 01:07:46,619
Jack?

Oh, my... Oh, my... Hey!

1144
01:08:58,024 --> 01:08:59,889
- Pretty incredible.
- Did Jack show up?

1145
01:08:59,891 --> 01:09:01,291
I haven't heard from him.

1146
01:09:01,293 --> 01:09:02,593
What do you mean,
you haven't heard from him?

1147
01:09:02,595 --> 01:09:04,527
I haven't heard
from him all night.

1148
01:09:04,529 --> 01:09:05,996
I haven't been able to find him.
I called him three times.

1149
01:09:05,998 --> 01:09:07,665
Listen, what happened
with the dancers there?

1150
01:09:07,667 --> 01:09:09,834
Well, I just thought
that I should do it alone

1151
01:09:09,836 --> 01:09:11,501
'cause it's so overwhelming.

1152
01:09:11,503 --> 01:09:13,269
Okay, but you can't
go rogue on me.

1153
01:09:13,271 --> 01:09:16,040
You have to understand
that this is what I do,

1154
01:09:16,042 --> 01:09:17,608
and you have to
trust me, okay?

1155
01:09:17,610 --> 01:09:19,544
So, if I give you
a couple of dancers,

1156
01:09:19,546 --> 01:09:23,550
don't not use them and then
miss a couple of steps, okay?

1157
01:09:25,217 --> 01:09:26,582
We also have to
change your hair.

1158
01:09:26,584 --> 01:09:28,117
We have to
change the color of your hair.

1159
01:09:28,119 --> 01:09:29,821
What's wrong with my hair?

1160
01:09:29,823 --> 01:09:31,255
I'm thinking platinum, or...

1161
01:09:31,257 --> 01:09:33,191
I don't wanna be
fucking blond.

1162
01:09:33,193 --> 01:09:36,960
I am who I am,
and I'm worried about Jack.

1163
01:09:36,962 --> 01:09:39,663
I will find Jack, okay?

1164
01:09:39,665 --> 01:09:41,101
I will find him.

1165
01:09:46,806 --> 01:09:49,107
Jack.

1166
01:09:49,109 --> 01:09:51,410
I feel like
we've done this before.

1167
01:09:53,445 --> 01:09:55,077
Didn't think
we'd do it so soon, man.

1168
01:09:55,079 --> 01:09:56,415
Come on, bro. Get up.

1169
01:09:58,484 --> 01:10:02,051
All right. There we go.

1170
01:10:03,722 --> 01:10:05,889
<i>In my mind,
I made it to the door.</i>

1171
01:10:05,891 --> 01:10:07,224
<i>I almost didn't wake you.</i>

1172
01:10:07,226 --> 01:10:08,595
<i>You looked so comfortable.</i>

1173
01:10:10,296 --> 01:10:11,696
How you doin'?

1174
01:10:11,698 --> 01:10:15,432
You know, I've seen
better days, I guess.

1175
01:10:15,434 --> 01:10:18,803
I apologize for
disrespecting your property...

1176
01:10:18,805 --> 01:10:20,103
No apologies necessary.

1177
01:10:20,105 --> 01:10:21,505
...or whatever I did.

1178
01:10:21,507 --> 01:10:23,073
- It's fine.
- You want some coffee?

1179
01:10:23,075 --> 01:10:24,375
Be great,
why don't you put some on,

1180
01:10:24,377 --> 01:10:25,442
and we'll come in in a minute?

1181
01:10:25,444 --> 01:10:27,147
Okay.

1182
01:10:28,513 --> 01:10:31,281
That's him, right?
That's your boy.

1183
01:10:31,283 --> 01:10:34,652
Jack, he's as old now

1184
01:10:34,654 --> 01:10:37,290
as you were when I met you.

1185
01:10:38,524 --> 01:10:40,290
Saw you on YouTube.

1186
01:10:40,292 --> 01:10:43,495
- That video with the girl.
- Yeah.

1187
01:10:45,029 --> 01:10:46,397
It made me happy, man.

1188
01:10:46,399 --> 01:10:49,334
You looked like you.
You were just...

1189
01:10:50,468 --> 01:10:52,638
Just doing it, bro.

1190
01:10:53,437 --> 01:10:55,175
She writes too.

1191
01:10:56,141 --> 01:10:58,308
- She wrote that tune?
- Yeah.

1192
01:10:58,310 --> 01:11:01,678
Bunch of others too.

1193
01:11:01,680 --> 01:11:05,816
Got hooked up with some
manager guy, wants to...

1194
01:11:10,222 --> 01:11:12,188
Yeah.

1195
01:11:12,190 --> 01:11:14,793
- She's good, bro.
- I know.

1196
01:11:16,328 --> 01:11:18,830
Maybe she's a way out.

1197
01:11:21,833 --> 01:11:24,470
Ain't nothing to
be afraid of, bro.

1198
01:11:25,503 --> 01:11:27,372
You know, it's like...

1199
01:11:31,577 --> 01:11:35,414
I don't know...
You float out...

1200
01:11:36,783 --> 01:11:41,352
Float out at sea, and then
one day, you find a port.

1201
01:11:41,354 --> 01:11:43,819
Say, "I'm gonna stay here
for a few days."

1202
01:11:43,821 --> 01:11:46,823
A few days
becomes a few years.

1203
01:11:46,825 --> 01:11:50,395
And then you forgot where you
were goin' in the first place.

1204
01:11:51,663 --> 01:11:53,362
And then you realize,
you don't really

1205
01:11:53,364 --> 01:11:55,299
give a shit about
where you was going

1206
01:11:55,301 --> 01:11:57,303
'cause you like
where you're at.

1207
01:11:58,503 --> 01:12:00,272
That's how it is for me.

1208
01:12:00,972 --> 01:12:02,542
I like where I'm at.

1209
01:12:03,810 --> 01:12:06,743
I didn't even realize
I liked it so much

1210
01:12:06,745 --> 01:12:09,880
till I saw your ass sleeping
in the grass this morning.

1211
01:12:14,019 --> 01:12:15,484
Yeah, come on, man.

1212
01:12:15,486 --> 01:12:17,757
You can rest
in my daughter's room, bro.

1213
01:12:22,793 --> 01:12:27,029
I thought of a million things
to say to you on the plane

1214
01:12:27,031 --> 01:12:29,269
that I can't remember.

1215
01:12:30,735 --> 01:12:31,770
Jack...

1216
01:12:32,771 --> 01:12:34,473
Glad you're here.

1217
01:12:35,708 --> 01:12:38,308
You did make it
to Memphis after all.

1218
01:12:42,981 --> 01:12:44,417
Fuck.

1219
01:12:45,450 --> 01:12:47,287
I won't do this again.

1220
01:12:48,654 --> 01:12:50,589
I won't come and find you.

1221
01:12:52,891 --> 01:12:55,560
Next time, you can clean up
your own mess.

1222
01:12:56,561 --> 01:12:58,363
You understand me?

1223
01:13:00,466 --> 01:13:02,334
How was the show?

1224
01:13:04,302 --> 01:13:06,672
It was fucking awesome.

1225
01:13:07,906 --> 01:13:09,542
I cut the dancers.

1226
01:13:09,941 --> 01:13:11,008
Dancers?

1227
01:13:11,010 --> 01:13:12,075
Yeah.

1228
01:13:12,077 --> 01:13:13,079
Oh.

1229
01:13:14,012 --> 01:13:15,448
Good.

1230
01:13:17,816 --> 01:13:20,084
Fucking dancers.

1231
01:13:20,086 --> 01:13:21,617
All you do is you just sing.

1232
01:13:21,619 --> 01:13:23,185
You made me so upset.

1233
01:13:23,187 --> 01:13:25,421
I'm sorry.

1234
01:13:25,423 --> 01:13:28,325
- I saw that video on YouTube.
- Oh!

1235
01:13:28,327 --> 01:13:29,492
It was great.

1236
01:13:29,494 --> 01:13:31,631
Thank you so much.

1237
01:13:35,633 --> 01:13:36,836
Excuse me one second.

1238
01:13:38,971 --> 01:13:41,603
- What's going on?
- Do you have a plier?

1239
01:13:41,605 --> 01:13:43,072
Jack's okay?

1240
01:13:43,074 --> 01:13:45,675
I wanna cut the guitar
strings, not too crazy.

1241
01:13:45,677 --> 01:13:48,911
There used to be pliers
or something like that.

1242
01:13:48,913 --> 01:13:50,813
Uh... Yeah, yeah.

1243
01:13:50,815 --> 01:13:52,349
I don't know
where my mom is.

1244
01:13:52,351 --> 01:13:55,685
- Yeah. I understand that.
- I think you're pretty.

1245
01:13:55,687 --> 01:13:57,487
Me?

1246
01:13:57,489 --> 01:13:59,322
You think I'm pretty?

1247
01:13:59,324 --> 01:14:01,992
Thank you.
I think you're pretty.

1248
01:14:01,994 --> 01:14:03,727
It was real great,
and then

1249
01:14:03,729 --> 01:14:05,728
Jack tells me
you wrote the song.

1250
01:14:05,730 --> 01:14:07,229
Yeah,
he got me to start singing

1251
01:14:07,231 --> 01:14:09,066
my own songs again.

1252
01:14:09,068 --> 01:14:11,501
He has a way of doing that.

1253
01:14:11,503 --> 01:14:13,036
Yeah, he does.

1254
01:14:13,038 --> 01:14:15,139
Does anyone want some
more mac and cheese?

1255
01:14:15,141 --> 01:14:17,977
Yeah? Here, sweetheart,
you want some?

1256
01:14:19,511 --> 01:14:22,511
Oh, there he goes.
What's up, man?

1257
01:14:22,513 --> 01:14:24,615
I understand what you said.

1258
01:14:24,617 --> 01:14:25,918
What the hell are you...

1259
01:14:42,467 --> 01:14:43,768
Are you kidding?

1260
01:14:43,770 --> 01:14:46,002
- That stupid?
- No. It's not stupid.

1261
01:14:46,004 --> 01:14:48,004
It wasn't a stupid thing
I just did?

1262
01:14:48,006 --> 01:14:49,973
Is that what you were doing
when you left the table?

1263
01:14:49,975 --> 01:14:52,943
I don't know. He told me he
was looking for some pliers.

1264
01:14:52,945 --> 01:14:54,545
I didn't know
what he was going to do.

1265
01:14:54,547 --> 01:14:55,982
I didn't think
he was gonna "do it" do it.

1266
01:14:56,781 --> 01:14:59,215
Oh, she has another ring!

1267
01:14:59,217 --> 01:15:00,718
Well, that's just temporary.

1268
01:15:00,720 --> 01:15:03,787
No, no, no.
Jack, wait a minute.

1269
01:15:03,789 --> 01:15:07,090
Let's anoint this.
Let's do it today.

1270
01:15:08,694 --> 01:15:10,327
- Yo, for real.
- It's a good idea!

1271
01:15:10,329 --> 01:15:11,661
No, you get the dress.

1272
01:15:11,663 --> 01:15:13,162
I'll call my cousin right now.

1273
01:15:13,164 --> 01:15:15,465
It's Saturday.
Nobody's gonna be in there.

1274
01:15:15,467 --> 01:15:17,567
- Let's go.
- You really wanna do that?

1275
01:15:17,569 --> 01:15:20,002
That place has
a magical quality to it.

1276
01:15:20,004 --> 01:15:22,471
It what?
It has a magical quality?

1277
01:15:22,473 --> 01:15:24,206
- It does.
- What do you mean?

1278
01:15:24,208 --> 01:15:26,076
- I mean that church is special.
- We can go.

1279
01:15:26,078 --> 01:15:28,612
- I'll take you to get a dress.
- There you go, right there.

1280
01:15:28,614 --> 01:15:31,081
It'd be great!
Okay, you're coming

1281
01:15:31,083 --> 01:15:32,816
with us for sure
because you're...

1282
01:15:32,818 --> 01:15:37,254
I can't believe this.
What am I doing? Okay, sure.

01:15:54,205 --> 01:15:55,339
Thank you so much.

Do you take him?

1291

01:16:15,226 --> 01:16:17,594
- I listened to what you said.

01:16:17,596 --> 01:16:19,528
I can't believe he did it.

I can't believe it.

1299
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:23,500
Now, one thing at a time,
okay?

1300
01:16:23,502 --> 01:16:24,870

1307
01:17:09,280 --> 01:17:11,014
- before they leave.
- Want me to check on her?

to go pretty soon, so...

1310
01:17:16,555 --> 01:17:17,990
Ally.

1311
01:17:19,725 --> 01:17:21,260
I'm coming in.

1312
01:17:25,564 --> 01:17:27,700

1313
01:17:30,468 --> 01:17:32,234

I don't know
who the hell I think I am.

1315
01:17:35,606 --> 01:17:38,041
One song is fine,

1316
01:17:38,043 --> 01:17:39,443
but to put out a whole record,

1317
01:17:39,445 --> 01:17:42,045
I don't know
what the fuck I was thinking.

1318
01:17:42,047 --> 01:17:43,679
I don't know
about all of that,

1319
01:17:43,681 --> 01:17:45,850
but you definitely
look like a star.

1320
01:17:46,552 --> 01:17:50,187
- Really?
- Yeah.

1321
01:17:50,189 --> 01:17:52,221
What do you think of her hair
and the look and the...

1322
01:17:52,223 --> 01:17:54,057
- Well, I discussed it with her.
- Yeah.

1323
01:17:54,059 --> 01:17:55,959
- No, I think it looks great.
- Was that your choice, or...

1324
01:17:55,961 --> 01:17:57,663
No, it was actually hers.

1325
01:18:00,065 --> 01:18:02,099
- No drink?
- What's that?

1326
01:18:02,101 --> 01:18:03,135
No drink?

1327
01:18:06,471 --> 01:18:07,872
No socks?

1328
01:18:09,673 --> 01:18:11,340
Touche. Touche, mate.

1329
01:18:11,342 --> 01:18:12,908
Yeah, I could never
get used to that,

1330
01:18:12,910 --> 01:18:15,211
the idea of not wearing socks.

1331
01:18:15,213 --> 01:18:16,545
Your feet get all...

1332
01:18:16,547 --> 01:18:18,048
No, actually
I'm wearing socks.

1333
01:18:18,050 --> 01:18:20,783
They're these kind of
little female insert socks

1334
01:18:20,785 --> 01:18:22,018
that work with these shoes.

1335
01:18:22,020 --> 01:18:23,553
Oh, you are.
You're just hiding them.

1336
01:18:23,555 --> 01:18:25,654
Yeah, I'm just hiding them.
That's right.

1337
01:18:25,656 --> 01:18:27,992
<i>Okay, now is this thing...
Yeah, there it is.</i>

01:19:14,972 --> 01:19:16,807
You know what? Can I just
talk to her for one second outside?

1361
01:19:16,809 --> 01:19:18,811
Just one sec, sorry.
Just be a second, yeah.

1362
01:19:27,319 --> 01:19:30,286
It doesn't do you any justice,
I'll tell you that.

1363
01:19:30,288 --> 01:19:32,456
You always said
you liked my nose.

1364
01:19:32,458 --> 01:19:35,192
- I love your nose.
- It's real big up there.

1365
01:19:35,194 --> 01:19:36,725
I wish it was bigger up there.

1366
01:19:36,727 --> 01:19:37,960
The whole thing

1367
01:19:37,962 --> 01:19:40,596
should just be
your fucking nose.

1368
01:19:40,598 --> 01:19:43,233
Fuck all those people
who ever said anything.

1369
01:19:43,235 --> 01:19:45,803
Just put a billboard
of your fucking nose up there.

1370
01:19:45,805 --> 01:19:48,904
Just the nose?
That's so ridiculous.

1371
01:19:48,906 --> 01:19:50,439
Listen,
if I just don't say this,

1372
01:19:50,441 --> 01:19:52,078
I'll never forgive myself.

1373
01:19:54,512 --> 01:19:55,847
What?

1374
01:19:59,016 --> 01:20:02,751
If you don't dig deep
in your fucking soul,

1375
01:20:02,753 --> 01:20:04,890
you won't have legs.

1376
01:20:06,056 --> 01:20:08,426
I'm just telling you that.

1377
01:20:10,262 --> 01:20:13,265
You don't tell the truth
out there, you're fucked.

1378
01:20:14,934 --> 01:20:17,300
All you got is you, and what
you wanna say to people,

1379
01:20:17,302 --> 01:20:18,934
and they are
listening right now,

1380
01:20:18,936 --> 01:20:20,237
and they're not gonna
be listening forever.

1381
01:20:20,239 --> 01:20:21,941
Trust me.

1382
01:20:23,540 --> 01:20:25,541
So, you gotta grab it.

1383
01:20:25,543 --> 01:20:26,977
And you don't apologize,

1384
01:20:26,979 --> 01:20:28,845
you don't worry about
why they're listening,

1385
01:20:28,847 --> 01:20:30,345
or how long they're gonna
be listening for,

1386
01:20:30,347 --> 01:20:32,517
you just tell 'em
what you wanna say.

1387
01:20:43,994 --> 01:20:48,230
'Cause how you say it
is the stuff of angels.

1388
01:20:48,232 --> 01:20:51,434
Pop! Six to the right,
and hot!

1389
01:20:51,436 --> 01:20:52,768
Ball, change. Down.

1390
01:20:52,770 --> 01:20:55,173
Hot! Ball, change.

Attitude.

1392
01:20:58,577 --> 01:21:00,343

1468

Hey, buddy.

01:27:02,105 --> 01:27:04,006
You're nominated

1476
01:27:04,008 --> 01:27:05,809
and it's fucking great.

1477
01:27:05,811 --> 01:27:08,614
Thank you.
How did you find that out?

1478
01:27:09,647 --> 01:27:11,249
Bobby told me.

1479
01:27:12,516 --> 01:27:15,184
He called. He said that

1480
01:27:15,186 --> 01:27:17,653
they wanna do
some Roy Orbison tribute.

1481
01:27:17,655 --> 01:27:19,389
They want me to sing and shit.

1482
01:27:19,391 --> 01:27:21,023
- Great.
- Some like supergroup thing.

1483
01:27:21,025 --> 01:27:24,727
But the point is, you got
nominated, and it's great.

1484
01:27:24,729 --> 01:27:26,929

Yeah, that's my song.
What about my song?

1490
01:27:42,079 --> 01:27:45,247
I fucking listened to it over
and over in the fucking...

1491
01:27:46,918 --> 01:27:48,352
You're not making any sense.

1492
01:27:50,354 --> 01:27:52,589
Yeah, just keep drinking.

1493
01:27:52,591 --> 01:27:53,822
That'll give you the answer.

1494
01:27:53,824 --> 01:27:55,524
Maybe I just fucking
failed you.

1495
01:27:55,526 --> 01:27:57,059
- That just kills me. I'm sorry.
- You what?

1496
01:27:57,061 --> 01:27:58,393
You failed me?

1497
01:27:58,395 --> 01:28:00,330
Yeah, you're embarrassing,
and it's just...

1498
01:28:00,332 --> 01:28:01,997
- I'm embarrassing?
- I feel bad for you.

1499
01:28:01,999 --> 01:28:04,000
- Yeah, I just... You know...
- I'm not fucking embarrassing!

1500
01:28:04,002 --> 01:28:05,468
- I just have to tell you.
- You're embarrassing!

1501
01:28:05,470 --> 01:28:06,870
And you know
what you're doing is

1502
01:28:06,872 --> 01:28:08,505
you're so embarrassed
of your fucking self

1503
01:28:08,507 --> 01:28:10,605
that you gotta put me down.

1504
01:28:10,607 --> 01:28:12,442
You're worried that you're ugly, and
you're not. I'm trying to tell you that.

1505
01:28:12,444 --> 01:28:13,442
So you need to
get all this fucking approval

1506
01:28:13,444 --> 01:28:14,643
by all these other people.

1507
01:28:14,645 --> 01:28:16,045
Why can't I just
be enough for you?

1508
01:28:16,047 --> 01:28:17,580
I don't need approval.

1509
01:28:17,582 --> 01:28:18,881
You know what I'd like is
for my boyfriend to love me.

1510
01:28:18,883 --> 01:28:20,383
Actually, for my husband
to love me.

1511
01:28:20,385 --> 01:28:21,917
Yeah, who's
your fucking boyfriend?

1512
01:28:21,919 --> 01:28:23,920
- You have a boyfriend?
- Yeah, I've got a boyfriend.

1513
01:28:23,922 --> 01:28:25,688
- That hurts.
- Yeah, I have a boyfriend.

1514
01:28:25,690 --> 01:28:27,089
Call me
your fucking boyfriend.

1515
01:28:27,091 --> 01:28:28,724
You're my boyfriend.

1516
01:28:28,726 --> 01:28:31,294
You're my boyfriend if you
don't treat me like your wife.

1517
01:28:31,296 --> 01:28:33,228
I don't even know
what that fucking means.

1518
01:28:33,230 --> 01:28:36,831
It means clean your shit up.
You're fucking messy.

1519
01:28:36,833 --> 01:28:39,402
- That's what it means.
- Well, that's not true.

1520
01:28:39,404 --> 01:28:40,804
- Oh, it isn't?
- Mmm-mmm.

1521
01:28:40,806 --> 01:28:43,072
Let's go. You wanna
be my drinking buddy?

1522
01:28:43,074 --> 01:28:44,340
Wanna practice?

1523
01:28:44,342 --> 01:28:45,441
I don't think
you could handle it.

1524
01:28:45,443 --> 01:28:48,678
You don't? Let me see.

1525
01:28:48,680 --> 01:28:50,446
And you know why? 'Cause
you're too worried about what

1526
01:28:50,448 --> 01:28:51,848
- everybody else is thinking.
- Here we go.

1527
01:28:51,850 --> 01:28:54,384
Here we go, Jack.
You want me to be your dad?

1528
01:28:54,386 --> 01:28:55,952
- Be your drinking buddy?
- Yeah.

1529
01:28:55,954 --> 01:28:58,420
Yeah, you couldn't be my dad
if you fucking tried.

1530
01:28:58,422 --> 01:29:00,223
He had more talent
in his fucking finger

1531
01:29:00,225 --> 01:29:01,790
than you have in
your whole fucking body.

1532
01:29:01,792 --> 01:29:04,594
So don't even fucking go there
about that, all right?

1533
01:29:04,596 --> 01:29:06,528
That's over the fucking line.

1534
01:29:06,530 --> 01:29:07,862
Why don't you
have another drink,

1535
01:29:07,864 --> 01:29:09,697
and we can just
get fucking drunk

1536
01:29:09,699 --> 01:29:11,600
until we fucking
disappear, okay?

1537
01:29:11,602 --> 01:29:13,236
Hey! Do you got those pills
in your pocket?

1538
01:29:13,238 --> 01:29:14,837
You're just fucking ugly,
that's all.

1539
01:29:14,839 --> 01:29:17,840
- I'm what?
- You're just fucking ugly.

1540
01:29:17,842 --> 01:29:19,774

- That was great.
- What are you doin' here?

1557
01:30:27,846 --> 01:30:29,411
Something fell through,

1558
01:30:29,413 --> 01:30:31,749

1559

1576
01:31:37,716 --> 01:31:39,948

"Paul Anka told me

Anka actually said to him?

1604
01:33:20,418 --> 01:33:22,751

- He said,

01:33:24,754 --> 01:33:26,988

Yeah, I'm great.

They have me going in early,
so I gotta go now and then...

1620
01:33:53,583 --> 01:33:55,984
But I made sure that they
tell me where you're sitting,

1621
01:33:55,986 --> 01:33:57,319

01:38:40,771 --> 01:38:43,738
<i>of such wonderful musicians.</i>

1697
01:38:43,740 --> 01:38:45,140
<i>This is a dream come true,</i>

1698
01:38:45,142 --> 01:38:46,608
<i>and all I can say is...</i>

1699
01:38:46,610 --> 01:38:48,443
<i>...believe in yourself,
and don't give up</i>

1700
01:38:48,445 --> 01:38:50,612
<i>because there is a spot
on that stage for you.</i>

1701
01:38:50,614 --> 01:38:53,081
- Oh, shit. Oh, fuck.
- <i>Good night.</i>

1702
01:38:56,988 --> 01:38:59,121
- I think I peed myself.
- Baby, just turn around.

1703
01:38:59,123 --> 01:39:00,458
Oh!

1704
01:39:02,159 --> 01:39:04,160
- I think I do...
- Baby, baby, can you...

1705
01:39:04,162 --> 01:39:05,993
- I think that's a bad come down.
- Holy shit!

1706
01:39:05,995 --> 01:39:07,429
- Just take him to the shower. Go to the left.
- Follow me, Wolf.

1707
01:39:07,431 --> 01:39:09,331
Ally, you just go
inside, okay?

1708
01:39:09,333 --> 01:39:11,133
- It's on the left, Dad.
- I got it.

1709
01:39:11,135 --> 01:39:12,667
- Go inside!
- They got him,

1710
01:39:12,669 --> 01:39:14,202
- they got him. They got him!
- It's my job!

1711
01:39:14,204 --> 01:39:15,604
Don't you fucking
do this to my daughter.

1712
01:39:15,606 --> 01:39:16,772
Hey, hey!

1713
01:39:16,774 --> 01:39:18,240
What the fuck is
wrong with you?

1714
01:39:18,242 --> 01:39:20,809
Get off!

1715
01:39:20,811 --> 01:39:24,612
Damn it!
Watch his fucking head.

1716
01:39:24,614 --> 01:39:26,583
What, what?

1717
01:39:27,885 --> 01:39:29,654
Bobby'll take you there.

1718
01:39:31,120 --> 01:39:33,921
You have Bobby's number?

1719
01:39:35,126 --> 01:39:37,628
No, Jack, hon,
you gotta sit up.

1720
01:39:38,995 --> 01:39:42,063
I don't want you to choke,
baby. Sit up!

1721
01:39:42,065 --> 01:39:44,500
All right,
I might've taken too much.

1722
01:39:44,502 --> 01:39:45,835
You all right in there?

1723
01:39:45,837 --> 01:39:47,238
I'm fine.

1724
01:39:48,638 --> 01:39:50,607
He's fine.

1725
01:39:53,510 --> 01:39:56,144
So,
everybody has their journal,

1726
01:39:56,146 --> 01:39:58,546
and we remember
the homework assignment,

1727
01:39:58,548 --> 01:40:02,050
the three things that
I wanted you to write down.

1728
01:40:02,052 --> 01:40:03,385
Jack, hey.

1729
01:40:03,387 --> 01:40:05,089
I'm sorry. I'm sorry I'm late.

1730
01:40:05,922 --> 01:40:07,958
You can't be late, Jack.

1731
01:40:08,693 --> 01:40:10,326
Understood, sorry.

1732
01:40:10,328 --> 01:40:12,696
Good, where's your journal?

1733
01:40:14,297 --> 01:40:17,167
- It's in my room.
- No, no, no.

1734
01:40:18,403 --> 01:40:20,669
Sit down.

1735
01:40:20,671 --> 01:40:23,572
So, it's all agreed. Nobody's
ever late here, right?

1736
01:40:23,574 --> 01:40:25,944
Okay. Good.

1737
01:40:27,145 --> 01:40:29,545
Anything you wanna tell us?

1738
01:40:29,547 --> 01:40:30,682
Um...

1739
01:40:35,520 --> 01:40:37,221
I'm grateful to...

1740
01:40:39,690 --> 01:40:41,326
To be here

1741
01:40:43,226 --> 01:40:45,229
and trying to
hold it together.

1742
01:40:48,332 --> 01:40:50,532
I'm Jack. I'm an alcoholic.

1743
01:40:50,534 --> 01:40:52,468
Jack.

1744
01:40:52,470 --> 01:40:53,972
Drug addict.

1745
01:41:09,686 --> 01:41:11,118
This is all my fault.

1746
01:41:11,120 --> 01:41:12,453
You don't have
that kind of power, Dad.

1747
01:41:12,455 --> 01:41:15,156
Eat your dinner.
Eat your food.

1748
01:41:15,158 --> 01:41:16,825
I don't even know
what meal it is.

1749
01:41:19,163 --> 01:41:20,765
Go and have some fruit.

1750
01:41:23,300 --> 01:41:26,671
How many times did you carry
my piano up the stairs?

1751
01:41:28,471 --> 01:41:31,508
How many times did you sit
there while I wrote a song?

1752
01:41:35,145 --> 01:41:38,313
- Always.
- Okay, it's okay. It's okay.

1753
01:41:38,315 --> 01:41:40,718
You didn't do anything.
It's not your fault.

1754
01:41:43,320 --> 01:41:47,025
You're just the greatest
person in the world.

1755
01:41:54,265 --> 01:41:57,068
<i>How long have you
been here now?</i>

1756
01:41:58,002 --> 01:41:59,470
<i>Two months.</i>

1757
01:42:02,006 --> 01:42:03,572
Can it be fixed?

1758
01:42:03,574 --> 01:42:04,939
Well, you would know that,
don't you?

1759
01:42:04,941 --> 01:42:06,175
Once it's gone, it's gone.

1760
01:42:06,177 --> 01:42:07,642
I don't know what you have.

1761
01:42:07,644 --> 01:42:09,478
Oh, well, the tinnitus,
they say, once you...

1762
01:42:09,480 --> 01:42:13,380
- Oh, tinnitus can't be fixed.
- Right.

1763
01:42:13,382 --> 01:42:15,716
Well, I just hear that tone,
that's all.

1764
01:42:15,718 --> 01:42:17,620
The tone, yeah.

1765
01:42:17,622 --> 01:42:19,554
The ringing.

1766
01:42:19,556 --> 01:42:21,057
I have hearing aids on,
as you...

1767
01:42:21,059 --> 01:42:22,825
No, I know.
That's why I asked you.

1768
01:42:22,827 --> 01:42:24,662
You know, I'm convinced that

1769
01:42:26,230 --> 01:42:28,529
it happened when I
was younger, I used to...

1770
01:42:28,531 --> 01:42:32,634
My dad had a Victrola,
an old record player.

1771
01:42:32,636 --> 01:42:35,437
My head was just about the
size of it when I was a kid,

1772
01:42:35,439 --> 01:42:39,174
and I used to love to just
put my whole head in there.

1773
01:42:39,176 --> 01:42:43,745
He was big into
the blues, so...

1774
01:42:43,747 --> 01:42:46,747
'Cause you gotta figure, it's
just me and him all day long.

1775
01:42:46,749 --> 01:42:51,321
My brother's out there tryin'
to make something of himself.

1776
01:42:52,455 --> 01:42:54,156
So I took one of his belts.

1777
01:42:54,158 --> 01:42:58,562
I put it around
the ceiling fan

1778
01:43:00,129 --> 01:43:01,766
and tried to do the deed.

1779
01:43:03,501 --> 01:43:06,233
The whole fucking fan
came out of the ceiling.

1780
01:43:14,177 --> 01:43:17,212
Had a big cut
on my fucking forehead.

1781
01:43:17,214 --> 01:43:21,351
I was more mad about that
than it not working.

1782
01:43:23,052 --> 01:43:24,888
And he didn't even notice.

1783
01:43:26,323 --> 01:43:27,688
He didn't even fucking notice.

1784
01:43:27,690 --> 01:43:29,793
- 'Cause he was drunk?
- Yeah.

1785
01:43:32,195 --> 01:43:36,266
That fucking fan stayed on the
floor for about half a year.

1786
01:43:38,368 --> 01:43:40,434
How old were you then?

1787
01:43:40,436 --> 01:43:42,873
I was just shy of 13.

1788
01:43:51,347 --> 01:43:52,582
Aww!

1789
01:43:58,120 --> 01:43:59,821
You smell good.

1790
01:43:59,823 --> 01:44:03,293
You smell good,
and you look good too.

1791
01:44:07,064 --> 01:44:08,496
Swimming. I've been swimming.

1792
01:44:08,498 --> 01:44:09,798
- You've been swimming?
- Yeah, there's a pool.

1793
01:44:09,800 --> 01:44:11,765
- I love that you're swimming.
- Yeah.

1794
01:44:11,767 --> 01:44:14,268
- That's a great pool there.
- Yeah.

1795
01:44:14,270 --> 01:44:15,970
How's Charlie?

1796
01:44:15,972 --> 01:44:17,773
Oh, Charlie's sweet.

1797
01:44:17,775 --> 01:44:20,578
He just sort of sits
by the door like this.

1798
01:44:23,480 --> 01:44:25,348
Waiting for daddy.

1799
01:44:29,218 --> 01:44:31,254
We're both waiting for daddy.

1800
01:44:34,190 --> 01:44:36,691
What, three weeks?

1801
01:44:36,693 --> 01:44:38,361
You are gonna
come back, right?

1802
01:44:39,896 --> 01:44:41,162
What do you mean?

1803
01:44:41,164 --> 01:44:43,799
You gonna come home
when you're done?

1804
01:44:43,801 --> 01:44:46,268
- Do you not want me to?
- No, I want you to.

1805
01:44:46,270 --> 01:44:48,569
I'm just wondering if...
I just...

1806
01:44:48,571 --> 01:44:50,005
- Where else would I go?
- I don't know.

1807
01:44:50,007 --> 01:44:51,805
I guess I just thought...
You know, it's like...

1808
01:44:51,807 --> 01:44:53,942
- There's Jack...
- Wait, wait, wait.

1809
01:44:53,944 --> 01:44:56,510
- Why would you say that?
- I don't know. I guess...

1810
01:44:56,512 --> 01:44:58,313
I wondered, without the booze,

1811
01:44:58,315 --> 01:44:59,982
if you would want
to come home.

1812
01:44:59,984 --> 01:45:01,515
'Cause when you met me,
you were drinking,

1813
01:45:01,517 --> 01:45:03,352
and now you're not.

1814
01:45:03,354 --> 01:45:05,487
I wasn't drunk the whole time
we were together.

1815
01:45:05,489 --> 01:45:07,658
I know, but...

1816
01:45:08,859 --> 01:45:11,559
But it got bad
when we were together.

1817
01:45:11,561 --> 01:45:13,661
It's okay. I mean, it's fine.

1818
01:45:13,663 --> 01:45:16,197
I just was wondering,
that's all,

1819
01:45:16,199 --> 01:45:19,600
and whatever you want is okay.

1820
01:45:19,602 --> 01:45:22,002
Whatever I want?
I wanna be with you.

1821
01:45:22,004 --> 01:45:25,206
- That's why I'm here.
- Okay, I know, I know.

1822
01:45:25,208 --> 01:45:27,711
I just want you to be happy.

1823
01:45:28,979 --> 01:45:30,714
I'm working on that.

1824
01:45:34,450 --> 01:45:36,386
I need to stick with you.

1825
01:45:40,056 --> 01:45:41,591
I brought something.

1826
01:45:44,261 --> 01:45:45,596
I wanna know

1827
01:45:46,997 --> 01:45:48,531
what this is.

1828
01:45:50,033 --> 01:45:52,367
"My Love."

1829
01:45:52,369 --> 01:45:54,004
You hiding love songs?

1830
01:45:55,105 --> 01:45:56,904
No, I wouldn't...

1831
01:45:56,906 --> 01:45:59,976
I wouldn't say
I was hiding it. I just...

1832
01:46:02,412 --> 01:46:03,911
I started puttin' it
down to paper

1833
01:46:03,913 --> 01:46:05,415
when we were at home.

1834
01:46:07,918 --> 01:46:10,085
I don't know, it just
sort of fell out of me,

1835
01:46:10,087 --> 01:46:12,390
I guess, and onto this page.

1836
01:46:15,825 --> 01:46:18,495
And I put it in here,
and I thought...

1837
01:46:20,864 --> 01:46:24,568
I thought
maybe you'd find it

1838
01:46:27,704 --> 01:46:29,907
when you came
back to you, maybe.

1839
01:46:39,248 --> 01:46:40,818
Well, I found it.

1840
01:46:48,992 --> 01:46:50,628
Listen.

1841
01:46:55,865 --> 01:46:57,368
I'm, uh...

1842
01:47:12,181 --> 01:47:14,782
I'm sorry.

1843
01:47:20,891 --> 01:47:22,493
It's okay.

1844
01:47:26,029 --> 01:47:28,528
I...

1845
01:47:28,530 --> 01:47:31,131
It's okay.
It's not your fault.

1846
01:47:31,133 --> 01:47:33,104
I'm sorry I did that.

1847
01:47:35,238 --> 01:47:36,971
It's okay.

1848
01:47:36,973 --> 01:47:39,642
It's not your fault.
It's a disease.

1849
01:47:41,645 --> 01:47:43,714
No, but I embarrassed you.

1850
01:47:45,781 --> 01:47:49,518
- I embarrassed you, and I...
- I'm not embarrassed of you.

1851
01:47:49,520 --> 01:47:52,286
It was so wrong.

1852
01:47:52,288 --> 01:47:55,091
And then your dad...

1853
01:47:57,560 --> 01:47:59,663
My father loves you,
it's okay.

1854
01:48:02,199 --> 01:48:03,968
I know, but I...

1855
01:48:06,369 --> 01:48:09,203
- It's okay.
- I know, but I...

1856
01:48:09,205 --> 01:48:10,641
It's okay.

1857
01:48:12,242 --> 01:48:13,778
It's okay.

1858
01:48:14,878 --> 01:48:16,611
<i>I have figured out
what I think is</i>

1859
01:48:16,613 --> 01:48:18,580
the best solution
for both of us.

1860
01:48:18,582 --> 01:48:20,814
Jack should come out
on tour with me.

1861
01:48:20,816 --> 01:48:23,484
We'll start with our duets.
I know he's gonna be able

1862
01:48:23,486 --> 01:48:24,752
to play by himself.

1863
01:48:24,754 --> 01:48:26,420
You realize
that's not an option.

1864
01:48:26,422 --> 01:48:29,724
He's so inside of his art
in a way he has never been.

1865
01:48:29,726 --> 01:48:32,393
- He can hear himself again.
- Ally, there is no way

1866
01:48:32,395 --> 01:48:36,600
that you can take Jack on tour
with you. There is no way.

1867
01:48:49,012 --> 01:48:50,978
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

1868
01:48:50,980 --> 01:48:52,913
You know what? If you can't
make that happen,

1869
01:48:52,915 --> 01:48:55,151
then fucking cancel the tour.
I don't know what to tell you.

1870
01:49:13,503 --> 01:49:15,370
I think if we had
a better band name,

1871
01:49:15,372 --> 01:49:17,040
we might've made it.

1872
01:49:19,809 --> 01:49:21,242
Or maybe it was 'cause

1873
01:49:21,244 --> 01:49:23,510
we looked like
a father and son duo.

1874
01:49:24,814 --> 01:49:27,249
Not many of those around.

1875
01:49:27,251 --> 01:49:30,919
I was not a good look for you,
that's for sure.

1876
01:49:30,921 --> 01:49:33,621
Not my fault I couldn't find
a better guitar player

1877
01:49:33,623 --> 01:49:36,025
in the whole goddamn state.

1878
01:49:42,132 --> 01:49:44,499
Where in the fuck is it?

1879
01:49:44,501 --> 01:49:45,869
Right here.

1880
01:49:53,877 --> 01:49:55,678
Thanks for the ride.

1881
01:49:58,748 --> 01:50:00,283
Sure thing, Jack.

1882
01:50:02,485 --> 01:50:06,256
Hey, you know, uh...
When I, um...

1883
01:50:14,131 --> 01:50:16,566
When I said I would...
You know, when I...

1884
01:50:23,940 --> 01:50:26,243
Took your voice, you know.

1885
01:50:35,452 --> 01:50:37,954
It's you
I idolized. It wasn't Dad.

1886
01:51:29,373 --> 01:51:31,208
What was that guy?

1887
01:51:41,551 --> 01:51:43,053
Hey.

1888
01:51:43,586 --> 01:51:45,254
Hey.

1889
01:51:46,689 --> 01:51:48,723
I wanna know
how you hear this.

1890
01:51:50,226 --> 01:51:52,160
That sounded unbelievable,
what you were playing.

1891
01:51:52,162 --> 01:51:54,495
- Thank you.
- It's nice to hear it.

1892
01:51:54,497 --> 01:51:55,897
Thank you, and I had

1893
01:51:55,899 --> 01:51:58,532
the beautiful backdrop
of you and Charlie.

1894
01:52:00,102 --> 01:52:01,868
I only heard it in my mind for

1895
01:52:01,870 --> 01:52:05,639
so many weeks,
so it's good to hear it...

1896
01:52:05,641 --> 01:52:06,942
The words are beautiful.

1897
01:52:06,944 --> 01:52:09,010
In the real thing.
In the real thing.

1898
01:52:14,217 --> 01:52:16,349
- Well, you want me to do that?
- Mmm-hmm.

1899
01:52:16,351 --> 01:52:19,519
Oh, God, I don't know.
I knew you were gonna ask me.

1900
01:52:44,948 --> 01:52:46,816
Back from the dead.

1901
01:52:48,918 --> 01:52:50,283
Hey, sorry.
Were you waiting long?

1902
01:52:50,285 --> 01:52:52,021
Hey, Jack. No, no.

1903
01:52:52,888 --> 01:52:55,023
Uh... Ally's not home.

1904
01:52:55,025 --> 01:52:57,559
No, I told her I'd meet her
here, if that's okay.

1905
01:52:57,561 --> 01:52:59,063
Of course, yeah.

1906
01:53:04,635 --> 01:53:06,166
Here you go.

1907
01:53:06,168 --> 01:53:09,536
Hey, thanks for taking care of
my girl when I was gone.

1908
01:53:09,538 --> 01:53:11,074
Anything for her.

1909
01:53:12,275 --> 01:53:15,309
She told me about
that European leg.

1910
01:53:15,311 --> 01:53:16,911
That's a hell
of an accomplishment

1911
01:53:16,913 --> 01:53:18,947
this soon out of the gate.

1912
01:53:18,949 --> 01:53:22,349
Shit, I remember
it was like ten years

1913
01:53:22,351 --> 01:53:24,419
before I even went
across the pond.

1914
01:53:24,421 --> 01:53:26,453
It was summer, 2004.

1915
01:53:26,455 --> 01:53:28,357
Shit, was it?

1916
01:53:33,896 --> 01:53:36,065
We're not exactly
friends here.

1917
01:53:39,136 --> 01:53:40,468
While you've been away,

1918
01:53:40,470 --> 01:53:42,036
we've been back here
in serious triage,

1919
01:53:42,038 --> 01:53:44,438
trying to clean up
your fucking mess.

1920
01:53:44,440 --> 01:53:47,144
Barely finding
our way through it.

1921
01:53:48,477 --> 01:53:50,745
You almost single-handedly
derailed her whole career.

1922
01:53:50,747 --> 01:53:52,979
You understand that?

1923
01:53:52,981 --> 01:53:54,885
She's never gonna
say this to you.

1924
01:53:55,985 --> 01:53:57,921
She loves you too much.

1925
01:53:59,588 --> 01:54:02,057
Just by staying married to
you, she looks like a joke.

1926
01:54:02,059 --> 01:54:05,291
It's embarrassing.

1927
01:54:05,293 --> 01:54:07,629
Let's be honest, we both know
it's only a matter of time

1928
01:54:07,631 --> 01:54:10,834
before that's pushed aside
again for the real thing.

1929
01:54:11,566 --> 01:54:13,470
And when that happens,

1930
01:54:14,736 --> 01:54:17,240
I don't want her
anywhere near you.

1931
01:54:28,284 --> 01:54:29,286
Hey.

1932
01:54:33,155 --> 01:54:35,689
I have some good news.

1933
01:54:35,691 --> 01:54:37,526
- Yeah?
- Mmm-hmm.

1934
01:54:37,528 --> 01:54:40,161
I'm not gonna go to Europe.

1935
01:54:40,163 --> 01:54:42,263
We're gonna cancel
the rest of the tour,

1936
01:54:42,265 --> 01:54:44,901
and I'm just gonna
be here all summer.

1937
01:54:47,070 --> 01:54:48,972
Isn't that great?

1938
01:54:50,539 --> 01:54:51,938
What happened?

1939
01:54:51,940 --> 01:54:53,774
Nothing happened.

1940
01:54:53,776 --> 01:54:55,777
The label just
loves the record,

1941
01:54:55,779 --> 01:54:57,044
and it's doing so well,

1942
01:54:57,046 --> 01:55:00,715
and they wanna keep
with the momentum

1943
01:55:00,717 --> 01:55:03,050
and have me make another one.

1944
01:55:03,052 --> 01:55:06,522
Rez is super psyched,
so it'll be great.

1945
01:55:08,891 --> 01:55:11,528
So tonight's
gonna be my last show.

1946
01:55:12,561 --> 01:55:15,431
Going out with
a bang at the Forum.

1947
01:55:18,467 --> 01:55:19,634
Great.

1948
01:55:19,636 --> 01:55:21,138
Yeah.

1949
01:55:24,807 --> 01:55:26,976
Why don't you come with me?

1950
01:55:28,744 --> 01:55:30,178
We can sing "Shallow"
together.

1951
01:55:30,180 --> 01:55:32,915
The fans will go crazy
to see you.

1952
01:55:36,320 --> 01:55:38,288
Come on, cowboy.

1953
01:55:42,825 --> 01:55:44,627
Yeah, why not? Okay.

1954
01:55:46,430 --> 01:55:47,862
Yeah?

1955
01:55:47,864 --> 01:55:49,296
Okay, good.

1956
01:55:49,298 --> 01:55:51,566
I'll have a car come get you.

1957
01:55:51,568 --> 01:55:53,268
Once I get there.

1958
01:55:53,270 --> 01:55:55,071
I'll go meet you there.

1959
01:56:04,047 --> 01:56:06,116
I'll see you soon, okay?

1960
01:56:10,619 --> 01:56:11,622
Hey.

1961
01:56:12,788 --> 01:56:13,990
What?

1962
01:56:16,392 --> 01:56:19,162
I just wanted to take
another look at you.

1963
01:56:23,999 --> 01:56:25,368
Bye, honey.

1964
01:56:26,269 --> 01:56:27,271
Bye.

1965
01:56:58,301 --> 01:57:00,100
Come here, Charlie.

1966
01:57:00,102 --> 01:57:01,471
Come here.

1967
01:57:37,507 --> 01:57:39,974
Thank you so much for
bringing us all here together.

1968
01:57:39,976 --> 01:57:43,777
Please look over all of the
dancers tonight and the band.

1969
01:57:43,779 --> 01:57:45,145
And my husband, Jackson.

1970
01:57:45,147 --> 01:57:47,650
We're so excited for him
to be here with us.

1971
01:57:48,685 --> 01:57:50,018
We got a big night.

1972
01:57:50,020 --> 01:57:51,285
We're at the Forum. LA.
Let's do this.

1973
01:59:56,445 --> 01:59:57,978
<i>♪ Why did you do that? ♪</i>

1974
02:00:00,216 --> 02:00:01,381
Is he here?

1975
02:00:01,383 --> 02:00:02,817
He's not here.

1976
02:00:02,819 --> 02:00:04,219
He's not here?

1977
02:00:04,221 --> 02:00:06,519
We have to do "Shallow"
regardless, okay?

1978
02:00:06,521 --> 02:00:07,888
The guitar's up there.

1979
02:00:07,890 --> 02:00:09,456
Everything's gonna
remain the same, okay?

1980
02:00:09,458 --> 02:00:10,691
- What?
- The guitar's up there.

1981
02:00:10,693 --> 02:00:12,026
Everything's gonna
remain the same.

1982
02:00:12,028 --> 02:00:13,527
Both verses.

1983
02:00:13,529 --> 02:00:15,028
I'm sure it was just a bit
much for him, that's all.

1984
02:00:15,030 --> 02:00:16,331
Please send somebody
to the house, please.

1985
02:00:16,333 --> 02:00:17,831
I'm doing it right now.

1986
02:00:17,833 --> 02:00:19,834
I have 15 seconds.

<i>Give it up for my husband,

1992
02:01:51,026 --> 02:01:52,928
I can stay, if you want.

1993
02:02:30,533 --> 02:02:32,532
Some kid started
singing one of his songs

1994
02:02:32,534 --> 02:02:34,570
in a bar I was
in the other night.

1995
02:02:37,873 --> 02:02:40,577
They're playing
his songs everywhere.

1996
02:02:44,312 --> 02:02:46,482
At first I got angry.

1997
02:02:47,917 --> 02:02:49,319
I don't know why.

1998
02:02:51,087 --> 02:02:52,955
I guess I felt like,

1999
02:02:54,289 --> 02:02:58,125
how can any of these people
feel like they knew him?

2000
02:02:58,127 --> 02:02:59,963
Who he really was.

2001
02:03:03,298 --> 02:03:05,568
But then something changed.

2002
02:03:07,236 --> 02:03:09,071
And it soothed me.

2003
02:03:11,774 --> 02:03:15,675
That it wasn't
all for fucking nothing.

2004
02:03:16,779 --> 02:03:19,682
The last thing
I did was lie to him.

2005
02:03:21,883 --> 02:03:23,586
Listen to me.

2006
02:03:25,421 --> 02:03:27,423
It isn't your fault.

2007
02:03:28,958 --> 02:03:30,560
It just isn't.

2008
02:03:32,462 --> 02:03:34,996
You know whose fault it was?

2009
02:03:34,998 --> 02:03:36,333
Jack.

2010
02:03:38,934 --> 02:03:40,470
That's it.

2011
02:03:41,870 --> 02:03:43,804
No one else.

2012
02:03:43,806 --> 02:03:46,008
Not you, not me.

2013
02:03:46,810 --> 02:03:48,108
No one but Jack.

2014
02:03:48,110 --> 02:03:50,710
I just keep

2015
02:03:50,712 --> 02:03:53,982
going over and over it,
over it in my head.

2016
02:03:58,154 --> 02:03:59,685
Jack talked about how music is

2017
02:03:59,687 --> 02:04:02,758
essentially 12 notes
between any octave.

2018
02:04:06,061 --> 02:04:08,832
12 notes
and the octave repeats.

2019
02:04:12,200 --> 02:04:14,104
It's the same story.

2020
02:04:15,236 --> 02:04:17,873
Told over and over.

2021
02:04:18,440 --> 02:04:19,943
Forever.

2022
02:04:21,577 --> 02:04:24,612
All any artist
can offer the world

2023
02:04:24,614 --> 02:04:27,514
is how they see
those 12 notes.

2024
02:04:27,516 --> 02:04:28,918
That's it.

2025
02:04:35,925 --> 02:04:38,160
<i>He loved how you see them.</i>

2026
02:04:40,062 --> 02:04:42,662
<i>He just kept saying,</i>

2027
02:04:42,664 --> 02:04:46,101
<i>"I love how she sees them,
Bobby."</i>

2028
02:04:54,342 --> 02:04:56,912
