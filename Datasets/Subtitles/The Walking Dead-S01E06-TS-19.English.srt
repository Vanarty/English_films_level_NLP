1
00:00:03,086 --> 00:00:06,215
- ( people yelling )
- ( radio chatter )

2
00:00:06,381 --> 00:00:09,134
Hey hey.
Whoa whoa whoa whoa.

3
00:00:10,426 --> 00:00:11,677
Ma'am. Ma'am, please.

4
00:00:11,844 --> 00:00:13,554
- Please, can you help me?
- No no no!

5
00:00:13,721 --> 00:00:15,264
- ( siren wailing )
- ( gunshots )

6
00:00:15,431 --> 00:00:18,100
Man:
Check them all. Check them all.

7
00:00:18,267 --> 00:00:20,852
( helicopter passing )

8
00:00:21,019 --> 00:00:22,187
( screams )

9
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:34,281
- ( growling )
- ( man screaming )

10
00:00:37,952 --> 00:00:41,372
( gunshots )

11
00:00:41,539 --> 00:00:43,541
( panting )

12
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:48,546
- Okay.
- ( heart monitor beeping )

13
00:00:48,712 --> 00:00:50,631
I'm gonna get you
out of here, bud.

14
00:00:50,798 --> 00:00:52,590
- ( gunshots )
- ( grunts )

15
00:00:54,092 --> 00:00:56,677
- ( helicopter passing )
- Okay. Okay.

16
00:01:05,811 --> 00:01:07,229
What do I do?

17
00:01:07,396 --> 00:01:09,022
( door opens )

18
00:01:11,942 --> 00:01:14,444
Man:
Come on, corporal. Move out!

19
00:01:15,779 --> 00:01:18,574
( gunfire )

20
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:20,616
( pounds, grunts )

21
00:01:20,783 --> 00:01:23,327
( helicopter passes )

22
00:01:26,539 --> 00:01:29,875
Listen to me. If you're gonna wake up,
I need you to do it now.

23
00:01:30,042 --> 00:01:31,460
Okay? Now.

24
00:01:31,627 --> 00:01:33,838
Please, man,
you just show me a sign. Anything.

25
00:01:34,005 --> 00:01:37,008
- Please, Rick.
- ( explosion )

26
00:01:37,174 --> 00:01:39,050
( power whirring down )

27
00:01:39,217 --> 00:01:42,304
Man:
The place is coming down!

28
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:44,806
Fall back!
All units fall back.

29
00:01:44,973 --> 00:01:46,808
( guns firing )

30
00:01:46,975 --> 00:01:48,893
( grunts )

31
00:01:59,112 --> 00:02:01,114
( crying ) I'm...

32
00:02:04,326 --> 00:02:05,994
I'm okay.

33
00:02:07,996 --> 00:02:10,707
( people yelling )

34
00:02:12,834 --> 00:02:14,878
- ( gunfire )
- ( woman screams )

35
00:02:15,045 --> 00:02:17,756
( growling )

36
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:51,498
( theme music playing )

37
00:03:29,661 --> 00:03:31,746
Shane:
Daryl, you cover the back.

38
00:03:33,998 --> 00:03:36,918
Rick: Hello?

39
00:03:37,085 --> 00:03:39,421
- Hello?
- Shane: Close those doors.

40
00:03:39,587 --> 00:03:40,755
Watch for walkers.

41
00:03:47,971 --> 00:03:49,555
- Rick: Hello?
- ( gun cocks )

42
00:03:52,307 --> 00:03:54,059
Anybody infected?

43
00:03:54,226 --> 00:03:56,228
One of our group was.

44
00:03:57,271 --> 00:03:58,897
He didn't make it.

45
00:03:59,981 --> 00:04:02,566
Jenner: Why are you here?
What do you want?

46
00:04:02,733 --> 00:04:05,277
A chance.

47
00:04:05,444 --> 00:04:08,071
That's asking
an awful lot these days.

48
00:04:09,906 --> 00:04:11,450
I know.

49
00:04:22,627 --> 00:04:24,337
You all submit to a blood test.

50
00:04:24,504 --> 00:04:25,880
That's the price of admission.

51
00:04:26,046 --> 00:04:27,965
We can do that.

52
00:04:29,841 --> 00:04:31,509
You got stuff to bring in,
you do it now.

53
00:04:31,676 --> 00:04:33,803
Once this door closes,
it stays closed.

54
00:04:39,559 --> 00:04:41,811
- ( beeps )
- Vi, seal the main entrance.

55
00:04:41,978 --> 00:04:43,772
Kill the power up here.

56
00:04:43,938 --> 00:04:46,733
( rattles, clangs )

57
00:04:47,776 --> 00:04:48,943
( beeps )

58
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:51,362
Rick Grimes.

59
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:54,157
Dr. Edwin Jenner.

60
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,035
( elevator humming )

61
00:04:57,202 --> 00:05:00,205
Doctors always go around
packing heat like that?

62
00:05:00,371 --> 00:05:03,666
There were plenty left lying around.
I familiarized myself.

63
00:05:05,084 --> 00:05:07,962
But you look harmless enough.

64
00:05:08,129 --> 00:05:09,380
Except you.

65
00:05:09,547 --> 00:05:12,132
I'll have to keep my eye on you.

66
00:05:13,634 --> 00:05:15,677
( chuckles )

67
00:05:20,015 --> 00:05:21,642
Carol:
Are we underground?

68
00:05:21,809 --> 00:05:23,352
Jenner:
Are you claustrophobic?

69
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:26,312
- A little.
- Try not to think about it.

70
00:05:31,317 --> 00:05:34,070
Vi, bring up the lights
in the big room.

71
00:05:34,237 --> 00:05:36,239
( humming, beeping )

72
00:05:40,535 --> 00:05:42,119
Welcome to zone 5.

73
00:05:43,162 --> 00:05:44,705
Where is everybody?

74
00:05:44,872 --> 00:05:46,874
The other doctors, the staff?

75
00:05:49,669 --> 00:05:51,545
I'm it.

76
00:05:51,711 --> 00:05:53,547
It's just me here.

77
00:05:54,923 --> 00:05:56,842
What about the person
you were speaking with?

78
00:05:57,008 --> 00:05:59,469
Vi?

79
00:05:59,636 --> 00:06:02,889
Jenner:
Vi, say hello to our guests.

80
00:06:03,056 --> 00:06:06,268
Tell them... welcome.

81
00:06:06,434 --> 00:06:09,145
Computer:
Hello, guests. Welcome.

82
00:06:10,647 --> 00:06:12,274
I'm all that's left.

83
00:06:15,694 --> 00:06:17,570
I'm sorry.

84
00:06:21,198 --> 00:06:23,617
Andrea: What's the point?
If we were infected,

85
00:06:23,784 --> 00:06:25,411
we'd all be running a fever.

86
00:06:25,578 --> 00:06:28,706
I've already broken every rule
in the book letting you in here.

87
00:06:28,873 --> 00:06:31,208
Let me just at least be thorough.

88
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:34,420
- ( syringe clicks )
- Jenner: All done.

89
00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:38,841
- Ooh.
- Jenner: Are you okay?

90
00:06:39,008 --> 00:06:41,135
- Mmm.
- She hasn't eaten in days.

91
00:06:41,302 --> 00:06:43,429
None of us have.

92
00:06:44,889 --> 00:06:48,434
- ( all laughing )
- Fine.

93
00:06:48,601 --> 00:06:49,935
You know, in Italy,

94
00:06:50,102 --> 00:06:53,606
children have a little bit
of wine with dinner.

95
00:06:53,772 --> 00:06:55,190
And in France.

96
00:06:55,357 --> 00:06:57,985
Well, when Carl is
in Italy or France,

97
00:06:58,152 --> 00:07:00,654
- he can have some then.
- What's it gonna hurt? Come on.

98
00:07:00,821 --> 00:07:02,489
- Come on.
- ( Dale laughs )

99
00:07:02,656 --> 00:07:04,867
- What?
- ( laughing )

100
00:07:07,536 --> 00:07:09,538
Dale:
There you are, young lad.

101
00:07:10,998 --> 00:07:13,042
( chuckles )

102
00:07:13,208 --> 00:07:15,669
- Eww.
- ( adults laughing )

103
00:07:15,836 --> 00:07:17,796
That's my boy. That's my boy.

104
00:07:19,506 --> 00:07:21,258
- Good boy.
- Yuck.

105
00:07:21,425 --> 00:07:23,469
- That tastes nasty.
- ( laughing continues )

106
00:07:23,636 --> 00:07:25,930
Well, just stick
to soda pop there, bud.

107
00:07:26,096 --> 00:07:27,932
- Daryl: Not you, Glenn.
- What?

108
00:07:28,098 --> 00:07:30,809
Keep drinking, little man. I want
to see how red your face can get.

109
00:07:30,976 --> 00:07:33,771
( men laughing )

110
00:07:36,482 --> 00:07:38,859
( clinks glass )

111
00:07:39,026 --> 00:07:41,487
It seems to me we haven't
thanked our host properly.

112
00:07:41,654 --> 00:07:43,614
He is more than just our host.

113
00:07:43,781 --> 00:07:46,825
- Hear hear!
- Here's to you, doc. Booyah!

114
00:07:46,992 --> 00:07:48,494
- Men: Booyah!
- Thank you. Thank you, doctor.

115
00:07:48,661 --> 00:07:50,955
- T-Dog: Booyah!
- ( glasses clink )

116
00:07:51,121 --> 00:07:54,041
So when are you gonna tell us
what the hell happened here, doc?

117
00:07:55,668 --> 00:07:59,088
All the-- the other doctors

118
00:07:59,254 --> 00:08:02,132
that were supposed to be
figuring out what happened,

119
00:08:02,299 --> 00:08:04,760
- where are they?
- Rick: We're celebrating, Shane.

120
00:08:04,927 --> 00:08:07,304
Don't need to do this now.

121
00:08:07,471 --> 00:08:10,683
Whoa, wait a second.
This is why we're here, right?

122
00:08:11,809 --> 00:08:13,227
This was your move--

123
00:08:13,394 --> 00:08:15,186
supposed to find all the answers.

124
00:08:15,353 --> 00:08:17,063
Instead we--
( chuckles )

125
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:19,439
we found him.

126
00:08:19,606 --> 00:08:22,442
Found one man. Why?

127
00:08:23,734 --> 00:08:25,610
Jenner:
Well, when things got bad,

128
00:08:25,777 --> 00:08:28,154
a lot of people just left,

129
00:08:28,321 --> 00:08:31,616
went off to be
with their families.

130
00:08:31,783 --> 00:08:33,910
And when things got worse,

131
00:08:34,077 --> 00:08:36,705
when the military cordon
got overrun,

132
00:08:36,871 --> 00:08:38,455
the rest bolted.

133
00:08:38,622 --> 00:08:40,958
Every last one?

134
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:45,254
No, many couldn't face
walking out the door.

135
00:08:47,172 --> 00:08:50,341
They... opted out.

136
00:08:50,508 --> 00:08:53,553
There was a rash of suicides.

137
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:58,641
That was a bad time.

138
00:08:58,808 --> 00:09:00,143
You didn't leave.

139
00:09:00,309 --> 00:09:02,020
Why?

140
00:09:02,186 --> 00:09:04,022
I just kept working,

141
00:09:04,188 --> 00:09:07,567
hoping to do some good.

142
00:09:11,446 --> 00:09:14,532
Dude, you are such a buzzkill, man.

143
00:09:17,744 --> 00:09:19,871
Most of the facility is powered down

144
00:09:20,038 --> 00:09:22,415
including housing,
so you'll have to make do here.

145
00:09:22,582 --> 00:09:24,500
The couches are comfortable,

146
00:09:24,667 --> 00:09:26,878
but there are cots
in storage if you like.

147
00:09:27,045 --> 00:09:31,174
There's a rec room down the hall
that you kids might enjoy.

148
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:34,177
Just don't plug in
the video games, okay?

149
00:09:34,343 --> 00:09:37,055
Or anything that draws power.
The same applies--

150
00:09:37,221 --> 00:09:39,223
if you shower,
go easy on the hot water.

151
00:09:41,934 --> 00:09:43,602
Hot water?

152
00:09:43,769 --> 00:09:46,480
- That's what the man said.
- ( both laugh )

153
00:09:51,026 --> 00:09:52,694
( knob squeaks )

154
00:10:01,453 --> 00:10:03,455
( laughing )

155
00:10:04,955 --> 00:10:06,457
Ah!

156
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:45,955
- Dale: Hey.
- ( Andrea vomiting )

157
00:10:50,292 --> 00:10:52,002
( sobs )

158
00:10:53,462 --> 00:10:55,506
( coughs )

159
00:10:56,549 --> 00:10:59,510
- Andrea?
- ( vomits )

160
00:10:59,677 --> 00:11:01,679
- Andrea.
- ( sobbing )

161
00:11:05,266 --> 00:11:06,725
That's it.

162
00:11:06,892 --> 00:11:09,353
That's it. Get it out.

163
00:11:11,021 --> 00:11:12,981
There you go.

164
00:11:14,607 --> 00:11:17,026
Oh... God.

165
00:11:17,193 --> 00:11:19,028
( flushes )

166
00:11:20,029 --> 00:11:22,031
( sobbing )

167
00:11:24,325 --> 00:11:26,201
Oh.

168
00:11:27,785 --> 00:11:30,079
Everything's gone.

169
00:11:30,246 --> 00:11:32,373
It's always better going down
than coming up, huh?

170
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:34,625
I don't mean the wine, Dale.

171
00:11:34,792 --> 00:11:39,046
You know, it's over.
There's nothing left.

172
00:11:40,214 --> 00:11:41,590
Don't you see that?

173
00:11:41,756 --> 00:11:44,426
Oh, I-- I see a--

174
00:11:44,593 --> 00:11:47,429
a chance to make a new start.

175
00:11:47,596 --> 00:11:48,888
( laughs )

176
00:11:49,054 --> 00:11:50,930
Oh my God, Dale.

177
00:11:51,097 --> 00:11:54,474
Dale, didn't you see
the look on Jenner's face?

178
00:11:54,641 --> 00:11:57,728
Hear what I'm saying.

179
00:11:57,895 --> 00:12:00,647
There's nothing left.

180
00:12:04,234 --> 00:12:06,236
( knocks )

181
00:12:07,487 --> 00:12:09,406
How's the blood?

182
00:12:09,573 --> 00:12:11,742
No surprises.

183
00:12:19,625 --> 00:12:21,627
I came to thank you.

184
00:12:24,046 --> 00:12:25,922
You did.

185
00:12:28,341 --> 00:12:30,343
You all-- you all right?

186
00:12:30,509 --> 00:12:32,970
You don't know what it's like.

187
00:12:33,137 --> 00:12:34,764
( laughs )

188
00:12:34,931 --> 00:12:37,058
You don't know
what it's like out there.

189
00:12:37,225 --> 00:12:40,102
You may think you do,
but you don't.

190
00:12:42,939 --> 00:12:44,731
We'd have died out there.

191
00:12:46,775 --> 00:12:49,110
It was only a matter of time.

192
00:12:49,277 --> 00:12:51,237
There's too many of those things.

193
00:12:53,948 --> 00:12:56,367
My-- my boy...

194
00:12:58,452 --> 00:13:01,705
my-- my wife, I never--

195
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:06,502
I never told ‘em
what I really thought.

196
00:13:10,756 --> 00:13:12,758
I never even hinted, just--

197
00:13:17,221 --> 00:13:19,139
just kept it in.

198
00:13:20,431 --> 00:13:23,643
Kept it in and kept us
moving, you know.

199
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:25,979
Just kept it in. Kept us--

200
00:13:26,145 --> 00:13:28,730
It'll all be okay.

201
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:34,319
It'll be okay.

202
00:13:42,034 --> 00:13:44,036
( chuckling )

203
00:13:47,081 --> 00:13:49,083
- Any good books?
- Carol: Uh-huh.

204
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:52,043
- ( book closes )
- Enough to keep us busy for years.

205
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:54,212
All right.
Come on, kids, it's bedtime.

206
00:13:55,588 --> 00:13:57,882
Baby, go say your prayers.
I'm gonna browse a bit.

207
00:13:58,049 --> 00:13:59,884
Carol:
Come on.

208
00:14:00,051 --> 00:14:02,804
This is the first night we might
actually get some real sleep.

209
00:14:02,971 --> 00:14:05,056
- Lori: Hmm.
- It's a miracle, isn't it?

210
00:14:24,284 --> 00:14:25,576
( slams door )

211
00:14:26,702 --> 00:14:28,704
( sighs )

212
00:14:28,871 --> 00:14:30,663
Jesus, you scared me.

213
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:32,999
I'm gonna tell you a few things

214
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:34,917
and you're gonna listen to me.

215
00:14:35,084 --> 00:14:36,502
Now is not the time.

216
00:14:36,669 --> 00:14:39,130
( chuckles )
Come on. When is it ever the time?

217
00:14:42,925 --> 00:14:45,178
How can you treat me like this?

218
00:14:45,345 --> 00:14:47,013
- You're kidding, right?
- No. Huh-uh.

219
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:49,015
Because you told me
my husband was dead.

220
00:14:49,182 --> 00:14:51,267
Jesus, Lori. I didn't lie
to you, all right? I didn't.

221
00:14:51,434 --> 00:14:53,770
Do you know
what it was like there?

222
00:14:54,854 --> 00:14:57,940
Stop. Things were falling apart.

223
00:14:58,107 --> 00:15:00,234
They were slaughtering
people in the hallways.

224
00:15:00,401 --> 00:15:03,112
It was a massacre.
There were walkers everywhere.

225
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:05,031
- So you left him?
- Everybody else ran.

226
00:15:05,198 --> 00:15:07,575
There were no doctors there.
It was just me.

227
00:15:07,742 --> 00:15:10,953
He was hooked up to machines
and I did not know what to do.

228
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,581
I even took my ear
and I put it on his chest

229
00:15:13,748 --> 00:15:16,000
and I listened for a heartbeat
and I did not hear one.

230
00:15:16,167 --> 00:15:17,543
And I-I-I-I--
I don't know why.

231
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:19,420
Maybe it was gunfire.
I don't know what it was,

232
00:15:19,587 --> 00:15:21,631
but there was no way
he could've survived that. No way.

233
00:15:21,798 --> 00:15:22,965
- He did.
- Yeah,

234
00:15:23,132 --> 00:15:25,635
but then I had y'all to think about,
didn't I? I had you and Carl,

235
00:15:25,802 --> 00:15:27,136
- and I needed to think about--
- Okay. No no.

236
00:15:27,303 --> 00:15:28,679
I had to get you guys
safe to Atlanta.

237
00:15:28,846 --> 00:15:30,222
That's what I had to do. Just stop.

238
00:15:30,389 --> 00:15:31,807
If you thought for one second

239
00:15:31,973 --> 00:15:34,350
that he was still alive,
would you have come?

240
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:36,309
So I saved your life--

241
00:15:36,476 --> 00:15:38,853
you and your little boy's.
That's what I did.

242
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:40,647
Right?

243
00:15:41,731 --> 00:15:43,107
Okay.

244
00:15:43,273 --> 00:15:46,527
And if I could've traded places
with him, I would have.

245
00:15:47,735 --> 00:15:49,946
I would trade places
with him right now because--

246
00:15:50,113 --> 00:15:52,448
- No no no. No.
- No no no, you--

247
00:15:52,615 --> 00:15:53,741
- I love you. Shh shh.
- No. No, you're drunk.

248
00:15:53,908 --> 00:15:55,451
- I love you.
- No, you're drunk.

249
00:15:55,618 --> 00:15:57,620
And I know there were some things
that say that you love me too,

250
00:15:57,787 --> 00:15:59,996
because there's no way that you could've
been with me the way that you were.

251
00:16:00,163 --> 00:16:02,123
- Shane. Shane. Shane!
- Just-- okay, stop.

252
00:16:02,289 --> 00:16:05,167
- Listen. You love me.
- Get your hands off me.

253
00:16:05,334 --> 00:16:07,169
- I love you. There's nobody here.
- Please! Ah!

254
00:16:07,336 --> 00:16:09,547
Stop, Lori.
It's all right. Just--

255
00:16:09,713 --> 00:16:11,882
( groans )

256
00:16:24,311 --> 00:16:26,021
( pounds wall )

257
00:16:26,188 --> 00:16:28,482
( sobbing )

258
00:16:46,667 --> 00:16:50,628
- ( belt buckle rattles )
- ( shoes clatter )

259
00:16:58,636 --> 00:17:00,220
( switch clicks )

260
00:17:12,441 --> 00:17:14,443
( crying )

261
00:17:18,906 --> 00:17:21,658
( whispering )
We don't have to be afraid anymore.

262
00:17:24,453 --> 00:17:26,747
We're safe here.

263
00:17:26,914 --> 00:17:28,582
All right?

264
00:17:33,212 --> 00:17:35,214
( sniffling )

265
00:17:40,636 --> 00:17:42,262
Glenn: Hello.

266
00:17:43,722 --> 00:17:45,724
- Rick: Morning.
- Are you hungover?

267
00:17:47,016 --> 00:17:50,603
- Mom said you'd be.
- Mom is right.

268
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:53,314
Mom has that annoying habit.

269
00:17:53,481 --> 00:17:57,902
Eggs. Powdered, but--
but I do ‘em good.

270
00:17:58,069 --> 00:18:00,404
- ( Glenn moans )
- T-Dog: I bet you can't tell.

271
00:18:00,571 --> 00:18:04,575
- Protein helps the hangover.
- ( moaning )

272
00:18:04,742 --> 00:18:06,285
Where'd all this come from?

273
00:18:06,452 --> 00:18:08,120
- Jenner.
- Rick: Could you help me, please?

274
00:18:08,287 --> 00:18:09,955
He thought we could use it.

275
00:18:10,121 --> 00:18:11,789
- Rick: Thank you.
- Some of us, at least.

276
00:18:11,956 --> 00:18:14,708
Don't ever ever ever
let me drink again.

277
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:16,961
- Shane: Hey.
- Hey.

278
00:18:18,753 --> 00:18:20,880
Rick:
Feel as bad as I do?

279
00:18:21,047 --> 00:18:22,799
Worse.

280
00:18:25,051 --> 00:18:27,303
The hell happened to you?

281
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:29,264
Your neck?

282
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:31,014
I must have done it in my sleep.

283
00:18:31,181 --> 00:18:32,683
Never seen you do that before.

284
00:18:32,849 --> 00:18:34,643
Me neither.

285
00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:37,145
Not like me at all.

286
00:18:41,692 --> 00:18:44,485
- Jenner: Morning.
- Shane: Hey, doc.

287
00:18:44,652 --> 00:18:48,322
Doctor, I don't mean to slam you
with questions first thing--

288
00:18:48,489 --> 00:18:50,241
But you will anyway.

289
00:18:50,408 --> 00:18:52,493
We didn't come here
for the eggs.

290
00:19:02,128 --> 00:19:04,380
- ( clicks, beeps )
- Give me playback of TS-19.

291
00:19:04,547 --> 00:19:06,465
Vi:
Playback of TS-19.

292
00:19:06,632 --> 00:19:08,801
( beeping )

293
00:19:08,968 --> 00:19:11,679
Jenner: Few people
ever got a chance to see this.

294
00:19:11,846 --> 00:19:13,806
Very few.

295
00:19:19,937 --> 00:19:23,316
- Is that a brain?
- An extraordinary one.

296
00:19:25,026 --> 00:19:27,320
Not that it matters in the end.

297
00:19:27,486 --> 00:19:28,821
Take us in for EIV.

298
00:19:28,988 --> 00:19:31,490
Vi:
Enhanced internal view.

299
00:19:48,215 --> 00:19:49,507
What are those lights?

300
00:19:51,259 --> 00:19:53,303
Jenner:
It's a person's life--

301
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:55,054
experiences, memories.

302
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:57,180
It's everything.

303
00:19:57,347 --> 00:19:59,849
Somewhere in
all that organic wiring,

304
00:20:00,016 --> 00:20:02,310
all those ripples of light,

305
00:20:02,477 --> 00:20:04,353
is you--

306
00:20:04,519 --> 00:20:06,980
the thing that makes you unique.

307
00:20:07,147 --> 00:20:09,524
And human.

308
00:20:09,691 --> 00:20:11,902
You don't make sense ever?

309
00:20:12,069 --> 00:20:13,445
Those are synapses,

310
00:20:13,612 --> 00:20:15,238
electric impulses in the brain

311
00:20:15,405 --> 00:20:17,240
that carry all the messages.

312
00:20:17,407 --> 00:20:20,035
They determine
everything a person says

313
00:20:20,202 --> 00:20:23,080
does or thinks
from the moment of birth

314
00:20:23,246 --> 00:20:25,040
to the moment of death.

315
00:20:25,207 --> 00:20:28,335
Death? That's what
this is, a vigil?

316
00:20:28,502 --> 00:20:30,170
Yes.

317
00:20:31,296 --> 00:20:35,257
Or rather
the playback of the vigil.

318
00:20:36,384 --> 00:20:38,344
This person died?

319
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:40,783
Who?

320
00:20:41,221 --> 00:20:43,765
Jenner:
Test Subject 19.

321
00:20:44,891 --> 00:20:47,310
Someone who was bitten

322
00:20:47,477 --> 00:20:49,604
and infected...

323
00:20:50,647 --> 00:20:52,899
and volunteered to have us

324
00:20:53,066 --> 00:20:55,151
record the process.

325
00:20:57,946 --> 00:21:00,323
Vi, scan forward
to the first event.

326
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:03,867
- Vi: Scanning to first event.
- ( beeping )

327
00:21:09,707 --> 00:21:11,709
What is that?

328
00:21:13,419 --> 00:21:16,088
It invades the brain
like meningitis.

329
00:21:17,172 --> 00:21:19,925
The adrenal glands hemorrhage,

330
00:21:20,092 --> 00:21:21,802
the brain goes into shutdown,

331
00:21:21,969 --> 00:21:23,929
then the major organs.

332
00:21:27,933 --> 00:21:29,601
Then death.

333
00:21:30,977 --> 00:21:33,688
Everything you ever were
or ever will be...

334
00:21:35,857 --> 00:21:38,151
gone.

335
00:21:38,317 --> 00:21:40,445
Is that what happened to Jim?

336
00:21:40,611 --> 00:21:42,487
Yes.

337
00:21:51,163 --> 00:21:53,331
Lori:
She lost somebody two days ago.

338
00:21:53,498 --> 00:21:55,082
Her sister.

339
00:21:56,083 --> 00:21:57,918
I lost somebody too.

340
00:21:58,085 --> 00:22:00,629
I know how devastating it is.

341
00:22:05,968 --> 00:22:07,636
Scan to
the second event.

342
00:22:07,803 --> 00:22:09,930
Vi:
Scanning to second event.

343
00:22:11,265 --> 00:22:13,850
Jenner:
The resurrection times vary wildly.

344
00:22:14,017 --> 00:22:15,643
We had reports of it happening

345
00:22:15,810 --> 00:22:17,896
in as little as three minutes.

346
00:22:18,062 --> 00:22:20,190
The longest we heard of
was eight hours.

347
00:22:20,356 --> 00:22:22,817
In the case of this patient,

348
00:22:22,984 --> 00:22:25,653
it was two hours, one minute...

349
00:22:26,696 --> 00:22:29,073
seven seconds.

350
00:22:39,292 --> 00:22:42,837
- It restarts the brain?
- No, just the brain stem.

351
00:22:43,004 --> 00:22:46,049
Basically,
it gets them up and moving.

352
00:22:46,216 --> 00:22:48,092
But they're not alive?

353
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,552
You tell me.

354
00:22:52,595 --> 00:22:54,806
It's nothing like before.

355
00:22:54,972 --> 00:22:57,141
Most of that brain is dark.

356
00:22:57,308 --> 00:22:59,977
Jenner:
Dark, lifeless, dead.

357
00:23:00,144 --> 00:23:01,604
The frontal lobe, the neocortex,

358
00:23:01,771 --> 00:23:02,979
the human part--
that doesn't come back.

359
00:23:03,146 --> 00:23:04,981
The you part.

360
00:23:05,982 --> 00:23:07,858
Just a shell

361
00:23:08,025 --> 00:23:10,444
driven by mindless instinct.

362
00:23:13,155 --> 00:23:15,616
God. What was that?

363
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:19,036
He shot his patient in the head.

364
00:23:21,747 --> 00:23:23,165
Didn't you?

365
00:23:23,332 --> 00:23:25,208
Jenner:
Vi, power down the main screen

366
00:23:25,375 --> 00:23:26,709
and the workstations.

367
00:23:26,876 --> 00:23:30,045
Vi: Powering down
main screen and workstations.

368
00:23:32,339 --> 00:23:34,883
You have no idea
what it is, do you?

369
00:23:37,678 --> 00:23:39,178
It could be microbial,

370
00:23:39,345 --> 00:23:41,180
viral, parasitic,

371
00:23:41,347 --> 00:23:44,308
- fungaL
- Or the wrath of God?

372
00:23:44,475 --> 00:23:47,770
There is that.

373
00:23:47,937 --> 00:23:49,772
Andrea:
Somebody must know something.

374
00:23:49,939 --> 00:23:51,523
Somebody somewhere.

375
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:54,901
Carol: There are others, right?
Other facilities?

376
00:23:56,777 --> 00:23:58,320
There may be some.

377
00:23:59,363 --> 00:24:00,614
People like me.

378
00:24:00,781 --> 00:24:02,657
But you don't know?
How can you not know?

379
00:24:02,824 --> 00:24:04,200
Jenner:
Everything went down.

380
00:24:04,367 --> 00:24:06,243
Communications,
directives-- all of it.

381
00:24:06,410 --> 00:24:09,288
I've been in the dark
for almost a month.

382
00:24:09,454 --> 00:24:11,414
So it's not just here.

383
00:24:11,581 --> 00:24:15,209
There's nothing left
anywhere? Nothing?

384
00:24:15,376 --> 00:24:17,920
That's what
you're really saying, right?

385
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,599
Jesus.

386
00:24:29,765 --> 00:24:31,809
Man, I'm gonna get
shit-faced drunk again.

387
00:24:31,976 --> 00:24:34,645
Dr. Jenner, I know this
has been taxing for you

388
00:24:34,812 --> 00:24:37,981
and I hate to ask
one more question, but...

389
00:24:39,189 --> 00:24:40,816
that clock--

390
00:24:40,983 --> 00:24:42,985
it's counting down.

391
00:24:45,029 --> 00:24:47,031
What happens at zero?

392
00:24:49,533 --> 00:24:53,954
The basement generators--
they run out of fuel.

393
00:24:55,956 --> 00:24:57,791
And then?

394
00:25:00,794 --> 00:25:03,255
Vi, what happens
when the power runs out?

395
00:25:03,422 --> 00:25:05,507
Vi:
When the power runs out,

396
00:25:05,674 --> 00:25:09,470
facility-wide
decontamination will occur.

397
00:25:11,764 --> 00:25:13,432
( beeps )

398
00:25:13,599 --> 00:25:15,851
Glenn: Decontamination--
what does that mean?

399
00:25:16,018 --> 00:25:17,978
Shane: I don't like
the way Jenner clammed up.

400
00:25:18,145 --> 00:25:20,314
The way he just
wandered off like that.

401
00:25:20,481 --> 00:25:23,025
What's wrong with him?
Seriously, man,

402
00:25:23,192 --> 00:25:24,818
is he nuts, medicated or what?

403
00:25:26,153 --> 00:25:28,322
In there.

404
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:35,996
- ( beeps )
- ( lights humming )

405
00:25:37,456 --> 00:25:39,083
Check that way.

406
00:25:39,249 --> 00:25:40,793
Shane.

407
00:25:56,392 --> 00:25:59,019
( chugging )

408
00:26:06,276 --> 00:26:07,778
It's empty.

409
00:26:07,945 --> 00:26:10,447
- ( sighs )
- ( generator clacks )

410
00:26:10,614 --> 00:26:13,617
- Vi: Emergency lighting on.
- What the hell is this?

411
00:26:16,954 --> 00:26:18,872
Hey, you guys kill the lights?

412
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:21,041
- Nah, it just went out.
- Rick: Anything?

413
00:26:21,208 --> 00:26:24,670
T-Dog:
Yeah, a lot of dead generators

414
00:26:24,837 --> 00:26:27,256
and more empty fuel drums
than I can count.

415
00:26:29,508 --> 00:26:31,593
It can't be down to just that one.

416
00:26:39,727 --> 00:26:43,397
Mom? Something wrong?

417
00:26:44,897 --> 00:26:46,607
Nothing. It's just...

418
00:26:46,774 --> 00:26:49,902
the air conditioning stopped.

419
00:27:04,917 --> 00:27:07,545
( sighs, sniffles )

420
00:27:07,712 --> 00:27:10,339
I did the best I could
in the time that I had.

421
00:27:12,924 --> 00:27:14,926
I hope you'd be proud of that.

422
00:27:35,447 --> 00:27:37,908
We always think
there's gonna be more time...

423
00:27:38,075 --> 00:27:41,286
( power whirs down )

424
00:27:43,871 --> 00:27:45,663
...then it runs out.

425
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:48,874
Carol:
Why is the air off?

426
00:27:49,041 --> 00:27:51,418
- And the lights in our room?
- Daryl: What's going on?

427
00:27:51,585 --> 00:27:53,003
Why is everything turned off?

428
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:54,797
Energy use is being prioritized.

429
00:27:54,963 --> 00:27:57,257
Dale:
Air isn't a priority? And lights?

430
00:27:57,424 --> 00:28:00,469
It's not up to me.
Zone 5 is shutting itself down.

431
00:28:00,636 --> 00:28:02,679
Daryl: Hey! Hey, what the hell
does that mean?

432
00:28:02,846 --> 00:28:05,182
- ( power whirs down )
- Hey, man, I'm talking to you.

433
00:28:05,349 --> 00:28:07,851
What do you mean
it's shutting itself down?

434
00:28:08,018 --> 00:28:09,645
How can a building do anything?

435
00:28:09,812 --> 00:28:11,312
- Jenner: You'd be surprised.
- Rick?

436
00:28:16,275 --> 00:28:17,985
Jenner, what's happening?

437
00:28:18,152 --> 00:28:21,321
The system is dropping all
the nonessential uses of power.

438
00:28:21,488 --> 00:28:24,825
It's designed to keep the computers
running to the last possible second.

439
00:28:24,991 --> 00:28:27,119
That started as we approached
the half-hour mark.

440
00:28:27,285 --> 00:28:29,121
Right on schedule.

441
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:43,176
- It was the French.
- What?

442
00:28:43,343 --> 00:28:45,137
They were the last ones
to hold out as far as I know.

443
00:28:45,303 --> 00:28:47,179
While our people were
bolting out the doors

444
00:28:47,346 --> 00:28:48,848
and committing suicide
in the hallways,

445
00:28:49,014 --> 00:28:50,390
they stayed in the labs till the end.

446
00:28:50,557 --> 00:28:53,810
They thought
they were close to a solution.

447
00:28:53,977 --> 00:28:55,687
What happened?

448
00:28:55,854 --> 00:28:57,981
Jenner: The same thing
that's happening here.

449
00:28:59,023 --> 00:29:00,358
No power grid.

450
00:29:00,525 --> 00:29:02,819
Ran out of juice.

451
00:29:04,237 --> 00:29:07,030
The world runs on fossil fuel.

452
00:29:07,197 --> 00:29:09,073
I mean,
how stupid is that?

453
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:12,033
- Shane: Let me tell you--
- Rick: To hell with it. I don't care.

454
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,536
Lori, grab our things.
Everybody, get your stuff.

455
00:29:14,703 --> 00:29:16,663
We're getting out of here now!

456
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:18,414
Oh, okay.

457
00:29:18,581 --> 00:29:20,373
- ( alarm blaring )
- What's that?

458
00:29:22,709 --> 00:29:24,377
What's that?

459
00:29:24,544 --> 00:29:27,463
Vi:
30 minutes to decontamination.

460
00:29:30,717 --> 00:29:32,802
Daryl:
Doc, what's going on here, damn it?

461
00:29:32,969 --> 00:29:34,553
Shane:
Everybody, y'all heard Rick.

462
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,263
Get your stuff and let's go!
Go now! Go!

463
00:29:36,430 --> 00:29:37,722
- Let's go.
- Glenn: Come on!

464
00:29:37,889 --> 00:29:40,600
( whirs, clangs )

465
00:29:40,766 --> 00:29:41,934
No.

466
00:29:43,394 --> 00:29:45,229
Did you just lock us in?

467
00:29:45,396 --> 00:29:47,272
He just locked us in!

468
00:29:47,439 --> 00:29:50,150
We've hit the 30-minute window.
I am recording.

469
00:29:51,358 --> 00:29:53,735
- Carl.
- Carl: Mom!

470
00:29:53,902 --> 00:29:55,486
- You son of a bitch.
- Shane!

471
00:29:55,653 --> 00:29:57,488
- You locked us in here!
- No, stop. Don't!

472
00:29:57,655 --> 00:30:00,325
- You locked us in here!
- Shane: No no no no! Don't!

473
00:30:00,491 --> 00:30:02,285
Wait, no!
No, don't do it.

474
00:30:04,954 --> 00:30:07,248
Hey, Jenner,
open that door now.

475
00:30:07,415 --> 00:30:09,667
There's no point.
Everything topside is locked down.

476
00:30:09,834 --> 00:30:11,169
The emergency exits are sealed.

477
00:30:11,336 --> 00:30:12,670
Dale:
Well, open the damn things.

478
00:30:12,837 --> 00:30:14,923
That's not something I control.
The computers do.

479
00:30:15,089 --> 00:30:17,926
I told you once
that front door closed,

480
00:30:18,092 --> 00:30:20,261
it wouldn't open again.
You heard me say that.

481
00:30:23,014 --> 00:30:25,058
- It's better this way.
- What is?

482
00:30:25,225 --> 00:30:27,434
What happens in 28 minutes?

483
00:30:27,601 --> 00:30:29,101
( keyboard clacks )

484
00:30:30,769 --> 00:30:32,604
- What happens in 28 minutes?!
- Daryl: Come on!

485
00:30:32,771 --> 00:30:35,106
Do you know what this place is?!

486
00:30:35,273 --> 00:30:37,609
We protected the public

487
00:30:37,776 --> 00:30:40,569
from very nasty stuff!

488
00:30:42,363 --> 00:30:44,615
Weaponized smallpox!

489
00:30:44,782 --> 00:30:47,868
Ebola strains that could
wipe out half the country!

490
00:30:48,035 --> 00:30:51,204
Stuff you don't want
getting out! Ever!

491
00:31:04,050 --> 00:31:06,635
In the event
of a catastrophic power failure--

492
00:31:06,802 --> 00:31:09,304
in a terrorist attack,
for example--

493
00:31:09,471 --> 00:31:12,724
HITs are deployed to prevent
any organisms from getting out.

494
00:31:12,891 --> 00:31:15,018
HITs?

495
00:31:16,686 --> 00:31:18,688
- Vi, define.
- Vi: HITs--

496
00:31:18,854 --> 00:31:21,482
high-impulse thermobaric
fuel-air explosives

497
00:31:21,649 --> 00:31:24,402
consist of a two-stage
aerosol ignition

498
00:31:24,568 --> 00:31:27,697
that produces a blast wave
of significantly greater power

499
00:31:27,863 --> 00:31:29,739
and duration than
any other known explosive

500
00:31:29,906 --> 00:31:31,366
except nuclear.

501
00:31:31,533 --> 00:31:34,326
The vacuum-pressure effect
ignites the oxygen

502
00:31:34,493 --> 00:31:36,787
at between 5,000° and 6,000°

503
00:31:36,954 --> 00:31:39,290
and is useful when
the greatest loss of life

504
00:31:39,456 --> 00:31:41,833
and damage
to structures is desired.

505
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,168
It sets the air on fire.

506
00:31:47,672 --> 00:31:49,548
No pain.

507
00:31:49,715 --> 00:31:51,049
( both crying )

508
00:31:51,216 --> 00:31:53,844
Jenner:
An end to sorrow, grief...

509
00:31:55,846 --> 00:31:57,389
regret.

510
00:32:05,689 --> 00:32:07,607
Everything.

511
00:32:14,489 --> 00:32:17,074
Open the damn door!

512
00:32:18,658 --> 00:32:20,493
Out Of my way!

513
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:22,120
- ( grunts )
- T-Dog: Daryl!

514
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:25,622
( both pounding, grunting )

515
00:32:26,665 --> 00:32:28,792
( crying )

516
00:32:30,586 --> 00:32:32,254
You should've
left well enough alone.

517
00:32:32,421 --> 00:32:35,257
- It would've been so much easier.
- Lori: Easier for who?

518
00:32:35,424 --> 00:32:37,259
All of you.
You know what's out there--

519
00:32:37,426 --> 00:32:41,263
a short, brutal life
and an agonizing death.

520
00:32:41,430 --> 00:32:45,559
Your-- your sister--
what was her name?

521
00:32:45,726 --> 00:32:47,269
- Amy
- Jenner: Amy.

522
00:32:47,436 --> 00:32:49,480
You know what this does.

523
00:32:49,646 --> 00:32:50,773
You've seen it.

524
00:32:50,939 --> 00:32:53,192
Is that really what you want
for your wife and son?

525
00:32:53,359 --> 00:32:55,402
( emphatically )
I don't want this.

526
00:32:55,569 --> 00:32:57,738
- ( axe bangs )
- Can't make a dent.

527
00:32:57,905 --> 00:33:00,407
Those doors are designed
to withstand a rocket launcher.

528
00:33:00,574 --> 00:33:02,450
- Well, your head ain't!
- Rick: Whoa! Whoa!

529
00:33:02,617 --> 00:33:04,409
Daryl! Daryl!

530
00:33:04,576 --> 00:33:08,205
Just back up! Back up!

531
00:33:08,372 --> 00:33:10,665
Jenner:
You do want this.

532
00:33:10,832 --> 00:33:12,084
Last night you said

533
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:13,752
you knew it was just
a matter of time

534
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:15,587
before everybody
you loved was dead.

535
00:33:15,754 --> 00:33:17,923
What?

536
00:33:19,925 --> 00:33:21,760
What?
You really said that?

537
00:33:21,927 --> 00:33:23,427
After all your big talk?

538
00:33:23,594 --> 00:33:25,137
I had to keep
hope alive, didn't I?

539
00:33:25,304 --> 00:33:26,931
Jenner:
There is no hope.

540
00:33:27,098 --> 00:33:29,100
- There never was.
- There's always hope.

541
00:33:29,266 --> 00:33:30,976
Maybe it won't be you,
maybe not here,

542
00:33:31,143 --> 00:33:32,603
but somebody somewhere--

543
00:33:32,770 --> 00:33:35,272
What part of "everything is gone"
do you not understand?

544
00:33:35,439 --> 00:33:37,691
Jenner:
Listen to your friend. She gets it.

545
00:33:37,858 --> 00:33:40,486
This is what takes us down.

546
00:33:41,529 --> 00:33:44,657
This is
our extinction event.

547
00:33:44,824 --> 00:33:48,369
( crying continues )

548
00:33:48,536 --> 00:33:50,830
Carol:
This isn't right.

549
00:33:50,996 --> 00:33:53,332
You can't just keep us here.

550
00:33:53,499 --> 00:33:56,127
One tiny moment--

551
00:33:56,293 --> 00:33:58,129
a millisecond. No pain.

552
00:33:58,295 --> 00:34:01,840
My daughter doesn't deserve
to die like this.

553
00:34:04,884 --> 00:34:07,303
Wouldn't it be kinder,

554
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:10,807
more compassionate
to just hold your loved ones

555
00:34:10,974 --> 00:34:14,143
- and wait for the clock to run down?
- ( gun cocks )

556
00:34:14,309 --> 00:34:15,811
- Shane, no!
- Out of the way, Rick!

557
00:34:15,978 --> 00:34:18,313
Stay out of my way!
Open that door

558
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,148
or I'm gonna blow your head off.
Do you hear me?!

559
00:34:20,314 --> 00:34:23,234
Brother, brother,
this is not the way you do this.

560
00:34:23,401 --> 00:34:25,736
- We will never get out of here.
- Shane, you listen to him.

561
00:34:25,903 --> 00:34:29,072
- Shane: It's too late.
- He dies, we all--

562
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:31,324
- ( yelling )
- --we all die! Shane!

563
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,664
Shane!

564
00:34:38,831 --> 00:34:40,707
( grunts )

565
00:34:41,708 --> 00:34:44,627
( panting )

566
00:34:47,714 --> 00:34:50,550
Are you done now?
Are you done?

567
00:34:50,717 --> 00:34:52,719
Yeah, I guess we all are.

568
00:35:14,866 --> 00:35:16,868
I think you're lying.

569
00:35:19,204 --> 00:35:21,413
- What?
- Rick: You're lying

570
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:24,124
about no hope.

571
00:35:24,291 --> 00:35:26,668
If that were true,
you'd have bolted with the rest

572
00:35:26,835 --> 00:35:29,713
or taken the easy way out.
You didn't.

573
00:35:31,632 --> 00:35:33,342
You chose the hard path.

574
00:35:33,509 --> 00:35:35,219
- Why?
- It doesn't matter.

575
00:35:35,385 --> 00:35:37,970
It does matter.
It always matters.

576
00:35:38,137 --> 00:35:40,973
You stayed when others ran.

577
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:44,227
- Why?
- Not because I wanted to.

578
00:35:44,393 --> 00:35:46,562
I made a promise...

579
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:49,773
to her.

580
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:52,149
My wife.

581
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:57,780
Test subject 19
was your wife?

582
00:35:57,947 --> 00:36:01,158
Jenner: She begged me
to keep going as long as I could.

583
00:36:02,618 --> 00:36:04,453
- How could I say no?
- ( pounding )

584
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:07,164
She was dying.

585
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:09,583
It should've been me
on that table.

586
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:11,042
I wouldn't have
mattered to anybody.

587
00:36:11,209 --> 00:36:14,378
She was a loss to the world.

588
00:36:14,545 --> 00:36:17,256
Hell, she ran this place.
I just worked here.

589
00:36:17,422 --> 00:36:19,841
In our field, she was an Einstein.

590
00:36:21,133 --> 00:36:24,387
Me? I'm just... Edwin Jenner.

591
00:36:24,554 --> 00:36:27,431
She could've done
something about this.

592
00:36:27,598 --> 00:36:29,725
Not me.

593
00:36:29,892 --> 00:36:32,477
Your wife didn't have a choice.

594
00:36:32,644 --> 00:36:36,898
You do.
That's-- that's all we want--

595
00:36:37,941 --> 00:36:40,734
a choice, a chance.

596
00:36:40,901 --> 00:36:42,361
( Daryl grunting )

597
00:36:42,528 --> 00:36:45,406
Let us keep trying
as long as we can.

598
00:36:51,829 --> 00:36:55,749
I told you topside's locked down.
I can't open those.

599
00:37:03,382 --> 00:37:05,384
( beeping )

600
00:37:07,761 --> 00:37:09,597
Come on!

601
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:13,434
- Let's go!
- Come on, let's go!

602
00:37:13,601 --> 00:37:16,562
- Daryl: Come on!
- T-Dog: Move it! Move it!

603
00:37:16,729 --> 00:37:19,189
- Daryl: Come on, let's go!
- Carol: We're gonna get out of here.

604
00:37:19,356 --> 00:37:20,940
There's your chance. Take it.

605
00:37:21,107 --> 00:37:23,318
I'm grateful.

606
00:37:23,484 --> 00:37:25,778
- The day will come when you won't be.
- Glenn: Let's go!

607
00:37:30,283 --> 00:37:32,285
( whispering )

608
00:37:39,125 --> 00:37:42,712
Hey, we've got four minutes left!
Come on!

609
00:37:42,879 --> 00:37:45,464
- Let's go. Let's go, Jacqui.
- No no, I'm staying.

610
00:37:45,631 --> 00:37:47,423
I'm staying, sweetie.

611
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:50,009
- But that's insane!
- No, it's completely sane.

612
00:37:50,176 --> 00:37:52,303
For the first time
in a long time.

613
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:54,930
I'm not ending up
like Jim and Amy.

614
00:37:58,142 --> 00:37:59,268
There's no time to argue

615
00:37:59,435 --> 00:38:02,104
and no point,
not if you want to get out.

616
00:38:02,271 --> 00:38:04,315
Just get out. Get out.

617
00:38:05,316 --> 00:38:07,693
T-Dog. Come on, man.

618
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:09,528
Come on!
Let's go! Let's go!

619
00:38:17,203 --> 00:38:19,163
I'm staying too.

620
00:38:20,206 --> 00:38:22,041
Andrea, no.

621
00:38:24,752 --> 00:38:27,129
- Just go! Go!
- Shane: Come on.

622
00:38:36,096 --> 00:38:37,722
Andrea,

623
00:38:37,889 --> 00:38:40,850
this isn't what
Amy would want for you.

624
00:38:41,017 --> 00:38:44,145
She's dead,
and you need to leave.

625
00:38:50,652 --> 00:38:53,113
- Glenn: Get them doors open!
- T-Dog: Come on!

626
00:38:53,279 --> 00:38:56,448
- Glenn: It doesn't work!
- Wait a minute! Wait a minute!

627
00:38:56,615 --> 00:38:59,368
- Try it! Try it! Try it now!
- Shane: Daryl!

628
00:39:01,870 --> 00:39:04,455
- Daryl: Come on! Come on!
- Stay close, sweetheart.

629
00:39:04,622 --> 00:39:06,708
( grunting )

630
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,420
Time's almost up.

631
00:39:12,255 --> 00:39:14,757
Daryl, look out!
( yelling )

632
00:39:21,973 --> 00:39:24,392
Dog, get down! Get down!

633
00:39:27,603 --> 00:39:29,439
- Jesus.
- Sophia: The glass won't break?

634
00:39:30,481 --> 00:39:32,942
Rick, I have something
that might help.

635
00:39:34,193 --> 00:39:35,945
Carol, I don't think
a nail file's gonna do it.

636
00:39:36,112 --> 00:39:37,947
Your first morning at camp,

637
00:39:38,114 --> 00:39:41,576
when I washed your uniform
I found this in your pocket.

638
00:39:44,328 --> 00:39:45,872
Come on.

639
00:39:46,038 --> 00:39:48,583
Glenn:
Look out!

640
00:39:55,631 --> 00:39:57,675
Oh, sh--

641
00:39:57,842 --> 00:39:59,302
- Get down! Get down!
- Shit!

642
00:39:59,469 --> 00:40:01,804
( glass shatters )

643
00:40:08,102 --> 00:40:09,812
Okay.

644
00:40:10,855 --> 00:40:12,647
You win.

645
00:40:20,697 --> 00:40:23,825
- What are you doing?
- I said okay.

646
00:40:26,244 --> 00:40:29,080
- Don't pull this, Dale.
- I'm not pulling anything.

647
00:40:29,247 --> 00:40:31,666
If you're staying, I stay too.

648
00:40:31,833 --> 00:40:34,836
He's right. We know
what's waiting for us out there.

649
00:40:35,003 --> 00:40:36,963
I don't want to face it alone.

650
00:40:37,130 --> 00:40:39,925
Dale, get the hell out.

651
00:40:40,091 --> 00:40:42,344
I don't want you here.

652
00:40:42,511 --> 00:40:45,347
Too bad.
See, you don't get to do that,

653
00:40:45,514 --> 00:40:47,516
to-- to come into somebody's life,

654
00:40:47,682 --> 00:40:50,310
make them care
and then just check out.

655
00:40:56,066 --> 00:40:57,858
I'm staying.

656
00:41:00,069 --> 00:41:01,821
The matter is settled.

657
00:41:04,406 --> 00:41:07,034

Wait wait wait. Wait wait.

661
00:41:34,270 --> 00:41:35,770
They're coming.

662
00:41:44,237 --> 00:41:46,239
( computer beeping )

663
00:41:47,574 --> 00:41:49,366
They got out.

Come on.

665
00:42:09,219 --> 00:42:12,014

- Dale, get down! Down!

666
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:15,893
Get back!
Everybody down! Down!

667
00:42:18,395 --> 00:42:19,687
Get down!
