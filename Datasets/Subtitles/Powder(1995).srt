maybe you could

it transforms,
but it doesn't stop ever.

679
01:02:32,834 --> 01:02:36,708
Uh, and he said that if
we ever got to the point

680
01:02:36,708 --> 01:02:39,125
where we could
use all our brain,

681
01:02:40,625 --> 01:02:43,041
uh, that we'd be
pure energy

682
01:02:43,041 --> 01:02:45,000
and that we wouldn't
even need bodies.

683
01:02:46,333 --> 01:02:50,208
Now, um, what would you
say to the possibility

684
01:02:51,375 --> 01:02:56,166
that because something
happened to you,

685
01:02:56,166 --> 01:02:59,041
uh, something
that never does
or isn't supposed to,

686
01:02:59,041 --> 01:03:03,708
that you are, are closer
to that energy level

687
01:03:03,708 --> 01:03:06,125
than any one body
has ever been?

688
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:09,667
I'd say, "So what?"

689
01:03:14,333 --> 01:03:15,625
So what?

690
01:03:18,417 --> 01:03:22,667
Jeremy, you know,
your life up till now
has been

691
01:03:22,667 --> 01:03:26,000
that farmhouse and, uh,
and the 12 acres of earth.

692
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,208
You know, you've kind
of lived in books.

693
01:03:28,208 --> 01:03:30,333
But I think you're
starting to find out now
that the misery

694
01:03:31,542 --> 01:03:33,834
that you read about
is real.

695
01:03:33,834 --> 01:03:36,041
The tragedy is, is real
in all those stories,
Jeremy.

696
01:03:36,041 --> 01:03:37,917
Did you think
that it wasn't?

697
01:03:39,875 --> 01:03:41,250
I mean, my God,
that deer hunt...

698
01:03:41,250 --> 01:03:43,708
You think that's
the dark side of man?
Killing for pleasure?

699
01:03:44,708 --> 01:03:46,917
I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry,

700
01:03:46,917 --> 01:03:49,834
but you haven't begun
to see what we do.

701
01:03:49,834 --> 01:03:54,041
We're... Jesus,
we're stumbling around
in a very dark age,

702
01:03:54,041 --> 01:03:56,959
basically just trying
not to kill each other.

703
01:03:56,959 --> 01:04:00,291
So it hurts me
when you say,
"So what?"

704
01:04:00,291 --> 01:04:04,041
Because you are not
just different, Jeremy.

705
01:04:04,041 --> 01:04:08,417
I think that you have
a mind that, uh,

706
01:04:08,417 --> 01:04:12,792
that we won't
evolve to for like, uh,
thousands of years.

the man of the future
right here and now.

here to hurt you.

did you ever have
a friend?

I don't need
a friend.

you, like, never shook
anybody's hand before?

to touch me after a while.

they...

730

doing here, Doug?

A couple of my deputies
told me that Harley Duncan

got rid of
every goddamn gun
in his house.

of the marksman tourney

some kind of crime?

I just got lots
of other stuff to do.

746
01:08:50,458 --> 01:08:52,834

stop carrying one
on the job?

pick it up and use it,
that's a liability.

you should have done.

something, Doug.

He lays his hand on the deer
while it's still shakin',

759
01:09:44,291 --> 01:09:46,917
and then he touches me
at the same time.

figure out why,
