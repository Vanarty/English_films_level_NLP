00:00:00,877 --> 00:00:02,337
(HARVEY READING)

2
00:00:02,587 --> 00:00:03,797
I've been after Sutter
for three years now.

3
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:05,340
This guy's one slippery
son of a bitch.

4
00:00:05,423 --> 00:00:07,133
Wait a second.
William Sutter?

5
00:00:07,217 --> 00:00:08,927
He came to me a week ago
to take him on.

6
00:00:09,052 --> 00:00:10,804
You cross one line
that puts me in jeopardy,

7
00:00:10,887 --> 00:00:12,430
I'm going to pull the plug
on this whole thing.

8
00:00:12,514 --> 00:00:14,683
I need a large,
expensive home
in the Hamptons.

9
00:00:14,933 --> 00:00:16,309
Why are you buying
a vacation home?

10
00:00:16,393 --> 00:00:17,477
Because I told Tara Messer

11
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:18,645
that I have
a property out there

12
00:00:18,728 --> 00:00:20,063
and I hired her
to remodel it for me.

13
00:00:20,146 --> 00:00:21,856
Damn it, Harvey!
I am not colluding on this,

14
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:23,233
and you're in here
trying to get me

15
00:00:23,316 --> 00:00:24,984
to bring an indictment
against your own client.

16
00:00:25,068 --> 00:00:26,903
Because when you bring
that indictment,
I'm gonna beat it,

17
00:00:26,986 --> 00:00:28,029
and if you don't bring it

18
00:00:28,113 --> 00:00:30,699
and continue
investigating my client,
I'm going to sue you.

19
00:00:30,782 --> 00:00:32,659
I think it's pretty goddamn
funny that you don't trust me

20
00:00:32,742 --> 00:00:35,036
when you're the one
that won't even tell me
what you're in here for.

21
00:00:35,245 --> 00:00:36,246
Okay.

22
00:00:37,122 --> 00:00:38,415
I'll do it.
Excuse me?

23
00:00:38,498 --> 00:00:39,708
Your pro bono.

24
00:00:39,791 --> 00:00:41,209
Bring me the file
tomorrow morning.

25
00:00:41,292 --> 00:00:42,544
It was a good fix, Sean.

26
00:00:43,128 --> 00:00:44,170
It was a good move, Harvey.

27
00:00:44,254 --> 00:00:45,255
Want to get a drink?

28
00:00:45,338 --> 00:00:46,339
Why don't we just
have one here?

29
00:00:46,423 --> 00:00:47,465
Why? As of right now,

30
00:00:47,549 --> 00:00:49,551
you have no action
pending against my client.

31
00:00:49,634 --> 00:00:51,803
But as of tomorrow, I do.

32
00:00:52,178 --> 00:00:54,264
Because those indictments are
coming down in the morning.

33
00:00:54,347 --> 00:00:55,557
Kevin, what did you do?

34
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:57,809
I got in a fight
with my wife.
I got drunk.

35
00:00:57,892 --> 00:01:00,645
I got into my car and...
I almost killed someone.

36
00:01:00,895 --> 00:01:02,731
I'm missing
a thousand chances

37
00:01:02,814 --> 00:01:04,399
to hug my kids
in the morning

38
00:01:04,482 --> 00:01:06,317
(VOICE BREAKING)
and kiss my wife goodnight.

39
00:01:06,526 --> 00:01:08,945
All because
I couldn't control myself.

40
00:01:09,279 --> 00:01:10,989
What were you fighting
with your wife about?

41
00:01:11,239 --> 00:01:12,490
I can't.

42
00:01:13,658 --> 00:01:14,868
I just can't.

43
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:26,337
Harvey.

44
00:01:27,088 --> 00:01:28,298
What are you
doing here?

45
00:01:28,381 --> 00:01:30,008
Mike, sit down.
I need to tell
you something.

46
00:01:32,927 --> 00:01:34,053
What's going on?

47
00:01:34,554 --> 00:01:36,639
I'm working on
getting you out of here.

48
00:01:36,723 --> 00:01:37,807
Yeah, I know you are.

49
00:01:38,308 --> 00:01:39,893
I'm not talking
about what we're
doing for Cahill.

50
00:01:39,976 --> 00:01:40,935
I'm talking about
something else.

51
00:01:41,019 --> 00:01:42,145
Harvey, we're in a room
full of people.

52
00:01:42,228 --> 00:01:43,605
You can't be talking
about Cahill.

53
00:01:43,688 --> 00:01:44,647
If Kevin
finds out, then...

54
00:01:44,731 --> 00:01:47,317
It doesn't matter
if Kevin finds out now.
He's done.

55
00:01:47,692 --> 00:01:49,027
What do you mean,
he's done?

56
00:01:49,402 --> 00:01:50,612
I mean,

57
00:01:51,362 --> 00:01:52,697
Rachel's dead

58
00:01:53,656 --> 00:01:54,908
and Kevin killed her.

59
00:01:58,077 --> 00:01:59,120
What?

60
00:01:59,996 --> 00:02:01,206
It's true.

61
00:02:02,165 --> 00:02:03,500
You son of a bitch.
You're lying to me.

62
00:02:03,917 --> 00:02:05,627
God damn it,
he told you he did it.

63
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:07,003
Bullshit.

64
00:02:07,086 --> 00:02:08,296
He got drunk.

65
00:02:08,379 --> 00:02:09,672
He got in a car,

66
00:02:10,006 --> 00:02:11,549
he murdered
the woman you love.

67
00:02:11,633 --> 00:02:12,634
Stop saying that.

68
00:02:12,717 --> 00:02:14,844
And now, you're gonna be
stuck in here with him

69
00:02:14,928 --> 00:02:15,970
for the rest
of your life.

70
00:02:16,054 --> 00:02:17,722
Stop it.
Kevin would never
do that to me.

71
00:02:17,806 --> 00:02:19,098
Mike, wake up!
No!

72
00:02:19,182 --> 00:02:20,433
Mike. Wake up.
No.

73
00:02:20,517 --> 00:02:21,518
Wake up.
No!

74
00:02:21,601 --> 00:02:23,561
Mike, wake up.
No! No! No!

75
00:02:23,645 --> 00:02:24,646
No! No! No!

Wake up!

Hey, you okay?

79
00:02:32,445 --> 00:02:33,696
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm fine.

80
00:02:34,072 --> 00:02:35,657
You sure? 'Cause that,
that was some dream
you were having.

81
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:36,825
I'm fine.

83
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:40,703
I'm just...

84
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,498
I'm going back
to sleep.

(ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)

86
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:57,512
Harvey, good,
there you are.

87
00:02:57,595 --> 00:02:59,222
What's going on?
Sutter just called.

88
00:02:59,305 --> 00:03:00,932
Let me guess.
The indictments
came down.

89
00:03:01,015 --> 00:03:02,475
He wants you
in his office
an hour ago.

90
00:03:02,559 --> 00:03:03,685
I'll tell him
you're on your way.

91
00:03:03,768 --> 00:03:05,895
No, tell him
you couldn't reach me.

92
00:03:06,646 --> 00:03:08,439
You want him
to start sweating.
But why?

93
00:03:08,523 --> 00:03:09,858
Because when people
start sweating,

94
00:03:09,941 --> 00:03:11,651
they start talking
to their lawyer.

95
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:14,696
I'll tell Ray
to be on hold.

96
00:03:14,779 --> 00:03:16,656
No, tell him
to pull around.

97
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:18,116
But you just said
you weren't going
to Sutter's.

98
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:20,451
I'm not. I'm going
somewhere else.

99
00:03:24,455 --> 00:03:26,040
Oh, look who it is.
The man of the hour.

100
00:03:26,124 --> 00:03:27,083
Did you get
my indictments?

101
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:28,334
I sure as hell did.

102
00:03:28,418 --> 00:03:29,377
And now that
the party's started,

103
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:31,087
why don't you tell me
what Kevin Miller knows.

104
00:03:31,588 --> 00:03:32,881
What are you
talking about?

105
00:03:32,964 --> 00:03:35,049
You went after the guy
to try to get him
to flip on Sutter.

106
00:03:35,133 --> 00:03:36,509
So, what did you think
he was gonna give you?

107
00:03:36,634 --> 00:03:38,344
I'm not gonna
tell you that.
Why not?

108
00:03:38,428 --> 00:03:39,888
Because I told you
when I started this thing,

109
00:03:39,971 --> 00:03:42,056
I'm not gonna collude.
We're not colluding.

110
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:43,433
It's called discovery.

111
00:03:43,516 --> 00:03:45,143
So, why don't you tell me

112
00:03:45,226 --> 00:03:47,061
what the hell
Kevin Miller knows.

113
00:03:48,938 --> 00:03:50,481
He developed
the trading programs

114
00:03:50,565 --> 00:03:53,568
that Sutter claims
to use to get his
"superior" returns.

115
00:03:53,651 --> 00:03:56,112
And that program's
got to be full of shit
because if it isn't...

116
00:03:56,195 --> 00:03:58,406
Then Sutter's
not inside trading.
Which he sure as shit is.

117
00:03:58,489 --> 00:04:00,158
So, you're looking
to have Kevin testify

118
00:04:00,241 --> 00:04:02,452
that software
is bullshit
and Sutter knows it.

119
00:04:02,827 --> 00:04:04,495
Bingo.
Then let me
ask you this.

120
00:04:04,579 --> 00:04:06,789
What exactly did you put
Kevin away for?

121
00:04:06,873 --> 00:04:07,957
And why do you need
to know that?

122
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:11,002
Because it might
help us figure out
what his weak spot is.

123
00:04:11,252 --> 00:04:12,629
We got him
on vehicular assault

124
00:04:12,712 --> 00:04:14,881
while driving
under the influence.

125
00:04:14,964 --> 00:04:16,424
Are you kidding me?

126
00:04:16,507 --> 00:04:17,967
Why didn't you think
to tell us that?

127
00:04:18,176 --> 00:04:19,177
Why would I?

128
00:04:19,636 --> 00:04:21,721
Mike's parents
were killed
by a drunk driver.

129
00:04:21,804 --> 00:04:22,931
And how the hell was I
supposed to know that?

130
00:04:23,014 --> 00:04:24,432
I don't know.
It would've been nice

131
00:04:24,515 --> 00:04:25,767
to know
what this asshole did

132
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:28,853
before we sent Mike
back into a cell with him.

133
00:04:35,026 --> 00:04:37,070
Hey, what happened
to you this morning?

134
00:04:37,987 --> 00:04:39,197
What do you mean?

135
00:04:39,864 --> 00:04:41,282
You skipped breakfast.

136
00:04:41,366 --> 00:04:42,700
I wasn't hungry.

137
00:04:43,034 --> 00:04:44,202
That all it was?

138
00:04:45,536 --> 00:04:46,621
What are you
talking about?
Come on, Mike.

139
00:04:46,704 --> 00:04:48,081
You had a nightmare
last night,

140
00:04:48,206 --> 00:04:49,624
you've been avoiding me
all morning,

141
00:04:49,707 --> 00:04:50,792
and you're acting
weird right now.

142
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:52,752
What's going on?
Nothing's going on.

143
00:04:54,671 --> 00:04:56,297
Then why the hell
were you in a cold sweat

144
00:04:56,381 --> 00:04:58,466
muttering something about
someone not finding out,

145
00:04:58,549 --> 00:04:59,968
and then
calling out my name?

146
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,931
All right, Kevin,
you want to know
what's going on?

147
00:05:05,556 --> 00:05:07,809
I had a dream
that you killed Rachel
in a car accident.

148
00:05:08,935 --> 00:05:11,104
That's probably why
I don't particularly
feel like

149
00:05:11,187 --> 00:05:12,438
hanging out with you
this morning.

150
00:05:12,522 --> 00:05:15,149
Because of what you told
me about your parents.
Mike, I'm really sorry.

151
00:05:15,233 --> 00:05:16,401
Are you?

152
00:05:16,943 --> 00:05:18,361
What? What's that
supposed to mean?
I mean, last night,

153
00:05:18,444 --> 00:05:20,905
you told me you almost
killed someone.
Are you sorry about that?

154
00:05:21,572 --> 00:05:23,992
You've got to be kidding me.
You have a dream and
now you're questioning

155
00:05:24,075 --> 00:05:25,493
if I feel bad about
what I did that night?

156
00:05:25,576 --> 00:05:26,911
You still haven't answered
whether or not you do.

157
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:29,330
You know what?
You need to be pissed off
at me to deal with your shit,

158
00:05:29,414 --> 00:05:30,498
you go right ahead.

159
00:05:30,581 --> 00:05:32,417
But I feel horrible about
what happened that night.

160
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,335
And for your information,
the guy that I hit

161
00:05:34,419 --> 00:05:36,504
is fully recovered
right now

162
00:05:36,587 --> 00:05:39,007
and I'm still in here
paying for this shit.

00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:57,066
<i>Everybody wanna see

00:05:57,150 --> 00:06:00,528
<i>I'll even eat a bean pie

<i>Busy, busy making money</i>

174
00:06:16,294 --> 00:06:17,503
Break out the
champagne, Louis.

175
00:06:17,587 --> 00:06:20,423
That house in the Hamptons
is gonna be yours
in 60 to 90 days.

176
00:06:20,548 --> 00:06:22,383
They accepted my offer?
That they did.

177
00:06:22,467 --> 00:06:24,927
Well, then, I have something
much better than champagne.

178
00:06:25,011 --> 00:06:26,179
Wood.

179
00:06:26,262 --> 00:06:28,097
I don't really see
how that's better
than champagne.

180
00:06:28,181 --> 00:06:29,766
Of course you don't.
Because you don't know

181
00:06:29,849 --> 00:06:32,060
that I'm having a replica
of my house made for Tara

182
00:06:32,143 --> 00:06:33,811
so she can see
her designs come to life.

183
00:06:34,145 --> 00:06:36,314
Louis, that's
actually really sweet.
I know.

184
00:06:36,606 --> 00:06:38,107
Now all I need to do...

185
00:06:39,442 --> 00:06:40,818
Is pick the perfect wood.

186
00:06:40,902 --> 00:06:42,445
I don't follow.
Donna,

187
00:06:43,112 --> 00:06:44,197
the kind of wood you get

188
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,448
says everything
you need to know

189
00:06:45,531 --> 00:06:46,574
about what kind
of man you are.

190
00:06:47,325 --> 00:06:49,118
How hard or soft it is.

191
00:06:49,202 --> 00:06:51,621
How much it bends
when you're working it.

192
00:06:51,746 --> 00:06:53,956
How firm it is
compared to...
I got the picture, Louis.

193
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,249
No, I don't think you do.

194
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:56,584
Making Tara love my wood

195
00:06:56,667 --> 00:06:58,252
is the first step
towards making her love me.

196
00:06:58,336 --> 00:06:59,420
Okay, Louis, calm down.

197
00:06:59,504 --> 00:07:00,963
No, no, I don't really want
to calm down,

198
00:07:01,047 --> 00:07:02,548
because all I can
think about is my wood.

199
00:07:05,051 --> 00:07:07,678
So, tell me exactly
how many different
kinds of wood

200
00:07:07,762 --> 00:07:09,430
have you sampled in your day?

201
00:07:09,514 --> 00:07:10,598
All of them.
Mahogany, chestnut,

202
00:07:10,681 --> 00:07:11,766
walnut, all the nuts.

203
00:07:11,849 --> 00:07:12,809
Ebony?
Ebony?

204
00:07:12,892 --> 00:07:14,143
Don't even get me
started on ebony.

205
00:07:14,227 --> 00:07:15,228
When I see ebony,
all I want to do is

206
00:07:15,311 --> 00:07:16,312
put my hands all over it.
Oh, God. (CHUCKLES)

207
00:07:16,395 --> 00:07:17,814
I want to live in it,
I wanna smack it,

208
00:07:17,897 --> 00:07:20,108
hit it, rub it down.
I just want to eat it.

209
00:07:20,358 --> 00:07:21,359
What's so funny?

210
00:07:22,068 --> 00:07:23,194
Nothing.

211
00:07:24,195 --> 00:07:27,573
Um, I just think that
a man needs to, uh...

212
00:07:27,657 --> 00:07:28,783
To follow his heart

213
00:07:28,866 --> 00:07:30,952
and choose the wood
that just feels right.

214
00:07:31,369 --> 00:07:32,453
Feels right.
Yeah.

215
00:07:32,537 --> 00:07:34,038
That's it. Donna.

216
00:07:35,456 --> 00:07:36,624
I need you to help me
feel my wood.

217
00:07:36,707 --> 00:07:38,209
Oh, dear God.
(LAUGHING)

218
00:07:42,255 --> 00:07:43,422
Goddamn it, Julie.

219
00:07:43,506 --> 00:07:45,133
Call his office again,
and this time

220
00:07:45,258 --> 00:07:47,343
tell them to find where the...
If you're talking about
my office,

221
00:07:47,426 --> 00:07:49,095
there's no need.
I'm right here.

222
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:50,847
What the hell took you
so long?
I was unavailable.

223
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:52,056
Well, I just
got indicted,

224
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:53,933
so from now on,
you make yourself
available.

225
00:07:54,016 --> 00:07:55,226
I get it.

226
00:07:55,309 --> 00:07:56,811
This all just
got real for you.

227
00:07:56,894 --> 00:07:58,813
So, why don't you
tell me right now?

228
00:07:58,896 --> 00:07:59,981
How real
is the rest of it?

229
00:08:00,064 --> 00:08:01,065
What are you saying?

230
00:08:01,149 --> 00:08:02,483
I'm saying
Cahill claims

231
00:08:02,567 --> 00:08:04,152
that you can't make
the returns you do,

232
00:08:04,235 --> 00:08:05,194
you say you can,

233
00:08:05,278 --> 00:08:06,320
and I want to know
how you do it.

234
00:08:06,404 --> 00:08:08,531
We use a proprietary
trading algorithm.

235
00:08:08,614 --> 00:08:10,158
Developed by who?
My son-in-law.

236
00:08:10,241 --> 00:08:11,242
Good, then we can
give it to Cahill,

237
00:08:11,325 --> 00:08:12,326
'cause he just
subpoenaed it.

238
00:08:12,535 --> 00:08:14,412
No, we can't.
Why the hell not?

239
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:16,497
Because the trades
on which I make
the most money

240
00:08:16,581 --> 00:08:17,999
have nothing to do
with that program.

241
00:08:18,082 --> 00:08:19,333
Are you kidding me?

242
00:08:19,417 --> 00:08:21,043
You're admitting
to inside trading?

243
00:08:21,294 --> 00:08:22,420
I'm not admitting
to anything

244
00:08:22,503 --> 00:08:24,338
except that sometimes
I trade with my gut.

245
00:08:24,589 --> 00:08:26,257
Well, I got news
for you, William.

246
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:29,343
To a jury,
that's gonna sound
like you're full of shit.

247
00:08:29,677 --> 00:08:31,095
Okay, smart guy.

248
00:08:31,429 --> 00:08:32,847
Pick up that journal.

249
00:08:33,556 --> 00:08:34,765
Give me a stock.

250
00:08:34,849 --> 00:08:36,225
NASDAQ, New York
Stock Exchange.

251
00:08:36,309 --> 00:08:38,144
I don't give a shit.
Just pick one.

252
00:08:39,145 --> 00:08:40,938
All right, Computech.
Computech.

253
00:08:41,022 --> 00:08:43,191
One point five nine
billion shares
outstanding.

254
00:08:43,274 --> 00:08:45,193
Yesterday's close,
32 flat.

255
00:08:45,276 --> 00:08:47,111
Today's opening,
33 and a quarter.

256
00:08:47,195 --> 00:08:48,404
PE's at 17.

257
00:08:48,487 --> 00:08:50,698
Earnings expected
to grow at 2% a year.

258
00:08:50,781 --> 00:08:51,866
What it doesn't
say in there

259
00:08:51,949 --> 00:08:53,326
is that the earnings
aren't gonna grow,

260
00:08:53,409 --> 00:08:54,994
because their CEO
doesn't give a shit.

261
00:08:55,077 --> 00:08:57,580
Which makes it a value trap
dressed up like a princess

262
00:08:57,663 --> 00:08:59,874
and I wouldn't touch it
with a 10-foot pole.

263
00:08:59,957 --> 00:09:01,209
That's a pretty
neat trick, William.

264
00:09:01,292 --> 00:09:03,336
But it isn't gonna
stop this subpoena.

265
00:09:03,544 --> 00:09:05,713
It's not a trick.
It's what I do.

266
00:09:06,631 --> 00:09:07,715
And what you're
gonna do

267
00:09:07,798 --> 00:09:08,799
is stop that
son of a bitch

268
00:09:08,883 --> 00:09:10,843
from getting his hands
on my program.

269
00:09:16,224 --> 00:09:18,935
Rachel, whatever it is,
it's going to have
to wait.

270
00:09:19,352 --> 00:09:21,103
Okay, but you told me
to bring you
everything I have

271
00:09:21,187 --> 00:09:22,313
on the Bailey case
this morning.

272
00:09:22,396 --> 00:09:23,522
Great. Leave it
on my desk,

273
00:09:23,606 --> 00:09:25,274
and I'll get to it
sometime this week.

274
00:09:25,358 --> 00:09:26,400
Oh, I'm sorry,
Jessica.

275
00:09:26,484 --> 00:09:28,027
I was really hoping
that we could
go over it today.

276
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:29,445
I was hoping to be
out the door by now.

277
00:09:29,528 --> 00:09:30,655
Look, I know
that I said

278
00:09:30,738 --> 00:09:32,531
this wouldn't take up
too much
of your time, but...

279
00:09:32,615 --> 00:09:35,201
Rachel, I said
I would do this
and I will,

280
00:09:35,701 --> 00:09:37,286
but you just
have to be patient.

281
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:38,496
I understand.

282
00:09:38,579 --> 00:09:40,831
It's just, Leonard Bailey's
been patient for 12 years.

283
00:09:40,915 --> 00:09:42,625
And I have sympathy
for the man,

284
00:09:43,376 --> 00:09:44,835
but today's not the day.

285
00:09:53,844 --> 00:09:54,887
Don't bother
with another menu.

286
00:09:54,971 --> 00:09:56,639
I'll just have
the Cobb salad.

287
00:09:58,641 --> 00:09:59,600
What do you think
you're doing?

288
00:09:59,684 --> 00:10:00,768
What does it look like
I'm doing?

289
00:10:01,018 --> 00:10:02,019
I'm having lunch
with a client

290
00:10:02,103 --> 00:10:03,354
to discuss his
investment business.

291
00:10:03,437 --> 00:10:05,439
You don't represent
my investment business.

292
00:10:05,523 --> 00:10:06,691
Which is exactly
why we need
to have lunch.

293
00:10:06,774 --> 00:10:07,900
No, we don't need
to have anything.

294
00:10:07,984 --> 00:10:10,069
Because the deal was
Harvey gets me cleared
of criminal charges,

295
00:10:10,152 --> 00:10:11,612
then you get the rest
of my business.

296
00:10:11,696 --> 00:10:13,030
I don't care what
the deal was, William.

297
00:10:13,114 --> 00:10:14,407
I care
what the deal is.

298
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:16,075
Because now that that
indictment's come down,

299
00:10:16,158 --> 00:10:19,370
Harvey is going
to be spending
all of his time on you.

300
00:10:19,578 --> 00:10:20,913
That's not my problem.

301
00:10:20,997 --> 00:10:22,957
I'm making it
your problem.

302
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,710
We get all of your business
or we handle none of it.

303
00:10:25,793 --> 00:10:26,877
Bullshit.

304
00:10:26,961 --> 00:10:29,380
You quit, you lose billables
you can't afford to lose.

305
00:10:29,755 --> 00:10:31,549
We quit and it looks
like we realized

306
00:10:31,632 --> 00:10:33,676
your case was a loser
and wanted
distance from it,

307
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:35,219
which you can't afford.

308
00:10:35,303 --> 00:10:37,555
You really wanna start
a business relationship
this way?

309
00:10:38,472 --> 00:10:40,725
I don't give a shit
how it starts, William.

310
00:10:40,808 --> 00:10:42,143
I give a shit
how it looks.

311
00:10:43,185 --> 00:10:44,186
Oh.

312
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:46,147
That's why
you did this here.

313
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:48,733
You want it to look like
you already
represent my firm.

314
00:10:48,816 --> 00:10:50,735
Well, look at that.

315
00:10:51,068 --> 00:10:53,154
Looks like I'm worth
hiring after all.

316
00:10:53,988 --> 00:10:55,948
So, are we actually
going to talk business

317
00:10:56,032 --> 00:10:58,576
or am I just gonna
bill you for the pleasure
of my company?

318
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,210
Mike, what can
I do for you?

319
00:11:10,212 --> 00:11:12,840
You can tell me if you do
straight up therapy or not.

320
00:11:13,257 --> 00:11:14,467
What's on your mind?

321
00:11:14,925 --> 00:11:16,260
You didn't answer
my question.

322
00:11:16,844 --> 00:11:17,845
I didn't think
I needed to,

323
00:11:17,928 --> 00:11:19,472
since we've been doing
straight up therapy

324
00:11:19,555 --> 00:11:20,848
since you got here.

325
00:11:20,931 --> 00:11:23,476
So, you want to tell me
what you're here for?

326
00:11:27,146 --> 00:11:30,983
My parents were killed
by a drunk driver
when I was 11.

327
00:11:31,067 --> 00:11:32,401
And yesterday,
I found out

328
00:11:32,485 --> 00:11:34,695
that Kevin almost killed
someone drunk driving.

329
00:11:34,779 --> 00:11:36,864
So, I need you to help me
act normal around him

330
00:11:36,947 --> 00:11:38,908
so that I can get
what I need
so I can get out of here.

331
00:11:39,116 --> 00:11:41,202
Oh, well, that's gonna
be a problem.

332
00:11:41,285 --> 00:11:42,495
Because
the goal of therapy

333
00:11:42,578 --> 00:11:44,955
is not to act normal,
it's to be normal.

334
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:46,332
Yeah, well,
I'll be normal

335
00:11:46,415 --> 00:11:47,833
when I'm home
with the woman I love

336
00:11:47,917 --> 00:11:50,419
instead of dreaming
that the guy I'm sharing
a cell with killed her.

337
00:11:50,795 --> 00:11:51,796
What?

338
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:54,048
I had a dream last night

339
00:11:54,507 --> 00:11:56,967
that I didn't have
to inform
on Kevin anymore

340
00:11:57,051 --> 00:11:59,428
because he killed Rachel
in an accident.

341
00:11:59,804 --> 00:12:01,389
And I must have been
talking about it
in my sleep

342
00:12:01,472 --> 00:12:03,182
because he asked me
about it today.

343
00:12:03,265 --> 00:12:05,184
So, I told him
the accident part

344
00:12:05,267 --> 00:12:06,644
and then
we got in a fight.

345
00:12:06,811 --> 00:12:07,978
A fight about what?

346
00:12:08,062 --> 00:12:10,606
I asked him
if he even felt bad
about the guy he hit.

347
00:12:10,856 --> 00:12:12,483
So, you turned it
back on him.

348
00:12:12,858 --> 00:12:13,984
What is that even
supposed to mean?

349
00:12:14,068 --> 00:12:16,028
It means that
I think you picked
a fight with Kevin

350
00:12:16,112 --> 00:12:18,239
because you didn't
wanna think about why
you had that dream.

351
00:12:18,322 --> 00:12:19,949
I know why
I had that dream.

352
00:12:20,032 --> 00:12:22,868
It's because he almost
killed someone the same way
my parents were killed.

353
00:12:22,952 --> 00:12:24,453
No, you had the dream
because you don't
wanna deal with

354
00:12:24,537 --> 00:12:25,621
what you're doing
to your friend.

355
00:12:25,913 --> 00:12:28,249
Oh, this again.
Yes, this again.

356
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:31,502
Mike, why do you think
that part of the dream
was finding out

357
00:12:31,585 --> 00:12:33,462
that you didn't have
to inform on him anymore?

358
00:12:33,546 --> 00:12:35,256
God damn it,
I did not come here

359
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:36,715
to second-guess
my decision.

360
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:38,509
Do you know what?
I don't care.

361
00:12:38,968 --> 00:12:40,428
Because I wouldn't
be doing my job

362
00:12:40,511 --> 00:12:43,347
if I didn't inform you
that actions
have consequences.

363
00:12:43,431 --> 00:12:44,432
And you seem to think

364
00:12:44,515 --> 00:12:46,392
that the only consequence
of what you're doing

365
00:12:46,475 --> 00:12:48,102
is getting
out of here early,
but it's not.

366
00:12:48,185 --> 00:12:50,688
No. I think
you don't know shit about
what I've been through.

367
00:12:51,522 --> 00:12:53,691
It was a mistake coming
to you for help.

368
00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:00,114
...and this is the
fifth bedroom.

369
00:13:00,197 --> 00:13:02,366
And I'm completely open
to you knocking
down walls

370
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:03,701
or removing windows,
by the way.

371
00:13:03,784 --> 00:13:05,828
Oh, no,
I love the windows.

372
00:13:05,911 --> 00:13:07,037
They let in
so much light.

373
00:13:07,121 --> 00:13:09,498
I agree, we should add
a wall of glass.
What do you think?

374
00:13:09,582 --> 00:13:11,125
I think the place
is beautiful

375
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:13,210
and I appreciate
you bringing
these photos over,

376
00:13:13,294 --> 00:13:15,838
but when can we go
see it in person?

377
00:13:17,256 --> 00:13:18,340
Uh, in person?

378
00:13:18,424 --> 00:13:19,467
Yes, of course.

379
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:21,051
I need to see the space

380
00:13:21,135 --> 00:13:22,470
before I can
start drafting anything.

381
00:13:22,553 --> 00:13:24,138
I was just thinking
we could work
closely together

382
00:13:24,221 --> 00:13:26,182
for the next
60 to 90 days
before you started that.

383
00:13:26,265 --> 00:13:27,349
That wouldn't
be productive.

384
00:13:27,433 --> 00:13:28,809
But I couldn't possibly
make it out there

385
00:13:28,893 --> 00:13:30,186
in less than seven
to 10 business days.

386
00:13:30,269 --> 00:13:31,479
That's too bad.

387
00:13:31,562 --> 00:13:33,230
I was gonna be out there
the day after tomorrow.

388
00:13:33,314 --> 00:13:34,482
I was thinking
we could see the space

389
00:13:34,565 --> 00:13:35,566
and then maybe
go have lunch.

390
00:13:36,066 --> 00:13:37,234
Lunch?

391
00:13:38,402 --> 00:13:39,403
Together?

392
00:13:39,987 --> 00:13:42,781
Well, I wasn't
thinking of eating
in separate restaurants.

393
00:13:43,157 --> 00:13:44,825
(LAUGHS)
Of course you weren't.

394
00:13:44,909 --> 00:13:46,243
The day after tomorrow
is perfect.

395
00:13:46,285 --> 00:13:48,287
But I thought
you couldn't...
I can and I will.

396
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:49,830
And I will meet you
at my ancestral home

397
00:13:49,914 --> 00:13:52,082
that I have owned
for quite some time,
the day after tomorrow.

398
00:13:59,632 --> 00:14:02,468
Your Honor,
I'm simply requesting
Mr. Sutter hand over...

399
00:14:02,551 --> 00:14:04,094
Something he has
no right to.

400
00:14:04,178 --> 00:14:05,387
I have every right
to make sure that

401
00:14:05,471 --> 00:14:07,264
your client is operating
within the law.

402
00:14:07,348 --> 00:14:10,351
And what exactly
is your basis to say
that he isn't?

403
00:14:10,434 --> 00:14:12,561
Your Honor,
when you break
the home run record

404
00:14:12,645 --> 00:14:14,188
and someone says
your bat is corked,

405
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,981
you turn it over
to show it's not.

406
00:14:16,941 --> 00:14:18,275
Except when that bat
is the reason

407
00:14:18,359 --> 00:14:19,693
you hit
all those homers.

408
00:14:19,777 --> 00:14:21,362
Because the second
he gets it,

409
00:14:21,445 --> 00:14:23,656
everyone in the world
is gonna know
what's in it,

410
00:14:23,739 --> 00:14:24,865
and my client

411
00:14:24,949 --> 00:14:26,992
might as well go out
of business right now.

412
00:14:27,284 --> 00:14:28,786
That is a
ridiculous supposition

413
00:14:28,869 --> 00:14:30,704
without a shred
of proof to back it up.

414
00:14:30,788 --> 00:14:32,206
How's this for proof?

415
00:14:32,289 --> 00:14:33,707
Your Honor,
six years ago,

416
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:37,002
Mr. Cahill went
on a fishing expedition
just like this one.

417
00:14:37,086 --> 00:14:38,379
That has nothing
to do with this.

418
00:14:38,462 --> 00:14:39,463
Oh, doesn't it?

419
00:14:39,547 --> 00:14:41,632
He subpoenaed
a proprietary
trading program

420
00:14:41,715 --> 00:14:43,300
from Kessler Capital,

421
00:14:43,384 --> 00:14:44,802
it proved no wrong-doing,

422
00:14:44,885 --> 00:14:46,512
and 10 months later,
they were out
of business.

423
00:14:46,595 --> 00:14:48,222
That has nothing to do
with my subpoena.

424
00:14:48,305 --> 00:14:51,392
And I have
an affidavit here
from Mr. Kessler saying

425
00:14:51,475 --> 00:14:53,727
it was directly because
of your subpoena.

426
00:14:53,811 --> 00:14:56,063
Mr. Cahill,
is what he's saying true?

427
00:14:56,355 --> 00:14:58,065
Did you go after Kessler
in the same manner

428
00:14:58,148 --> 00:14:59,650
and did he go under
10 months later?

429
00:15:00,609 --> 00:15:01,986
Yes, but...
No buts.

430
00:15:02,945 --> 00:15:05,614
Do you have
any other evidence
to present to the court?

431
00:15:06,156 --> 00:15:07,491
Not at this time,
Your Honor.

432
00:15:08,033 --> 00:15:09,702
Then your request
is denied.

433
00:15:10,494 --> 00:15:11,662
(GAVEL BANGING)

434
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:17,418
LOUIS:
Oh, there you are.

435
00:15:17,501 --> 00:15:18,877
What the hell are you doing
in the executive kitchen?

436
00:15:18,961 --> 00:15:20,004
What does it look like
I'm doing?

437
00:15:20,045 --> 00:15:21,922
I'm being executive.
But you're not
an executive.

438
00:15:22,006 --> 00:15:24,341
Until I made
the executive decision
that I was.

439
00:15:25,342 --> 00:15:27,469
Now, is there something
I can help you with?

440
00:15:27,553 --> 00:15:29,430
Yeah, I want you
to forget that latte

441
00:15:29,513 --> 00:15:31,557
and get me
unfettered access
to my new home

442
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:32,641
after thoroughly
cleansing it

443
00:15:32,725 --> 00:15:34,268
of any trace of its
former occupants.

444
00:15:34,351 --> 00:15:35,936
And why exactly do you
need me to do that?

445
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:37,396
Because Tara wants
to see the house

446
00:15:37,479 --> 00:15:39,106
and then have
lunch with me
the day after tomorrow.

447
00:15:39,189 --> 00:15:41,275
Louis, your offer
was just accepted

448
00:15:41,358 --> 00:15:43,777
and there's never been
a one-day escrow
in the history of escrows.

449
00:15:43,861 --> 00:15:44,945
You don't think
I know that?

450
00:15:45,029 --> 00:15:46,280
I just spent
the last hour arguing

451
00:15:46,363 --> 00:15:47,573
with five different
escrow officers.

452
00:15:47,656 --> 00:15:48,907
I get it.

453
00:15:49,241 --> 00:15:50,451
You want me
to get people
to do things

454
00:15:50,534 --> 00:15:52,244
they'd never be
willing to do
in a time frame

455
00:15:52,328 --> 00:15:53,829
that makes it impossible
for them to do it in.

456
00:15:53,912 --> 00:15:54,913
Exactly.

457
00:15:54,997 --> 00:15:56,707
Then make me
a double latte and get
the hell out of my way

458
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:59,918
because I'm about to
executive-decision your
sorry ass into that house.

459
00:16:02,254 --> 00:16:03,881
HARVEY:
What are you drinking?

460
00:16:03,964 --> 00:16:04,965
A 60-year-old bottle

461
00:16:05,049 --> 00:16:06,467
of the finest single malt
in the world.

462
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:07,593
Then get me a glass.

463
00:16:07,676 --> 00:16:09,637
Not until I know
what happened
in court today.

464
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,013
Well, let me
put it this way.

465
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:13,849
The only thing that
Sean Cahill's gonna
be drinking tonight

466
00:16:13,932 --> 00:16:15,392
is a shit-out-
of-luck daiquiri.

467
00:16:15,893 --> 00:16:17,102
How did you get it done?

468
00:16:17,186 --> 00:16:20,356
I established a pattern
of him going fishing
without enough bait.

469
00:16:20,439 --> 00:16:21,774
Then have a drink before
you get back in there

470
00:16:21,857 --> 00:16:24,568
and knock the bastard out
before he can throw
another punch.

471
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:25,819
What are you saying?

472
00:16:25,903 --> 00:16:27,571
I'm saying I want you
to get this
entire action dismissed.

473
00:16:29,698 --> 00:16:31,283
William, that's
a terrible idea.

474
00:16:31,367 --> 00:16:33,410
Not to me,
because he's got nothing.

475
00:16:33,494 --> 00:16:36,080
I don't care,
what you're suggesting
is a mistake.

476
00:16:36,664 --> 00:16:37,998
You still haven't
told me why.

477
00:16:38,082 --> 00:16:39,667
Because you only get
one shot at dismissal

478
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,168
and now's not the time
to take it.

479
00:16:41,251 --> 00:16:43,212
Well, I say it is and
I'm not suggesting it.

480
00:16:43,295 --> 00:16:44,546
I'm flat out
telling you to do it.

481
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:47,508
I didn't get where I am
by letting my clients
bully me.

482
00:16:47,591 --> 00:16:50,678
And I didn't get where I am
by allowing my employees
to dictate terms.

483
00:16:50,761 --> 00:16:53,013
Which I already did
once today and I'm not
gonna do it again.

484
00:16:53,097 --> 00:16:54,181
What's that
supposed to mean?

485
00:16:54,264 --> 00:16:55,766
It means Jessica Pearson
convinced me

486
00:16:55,849 --> 00:16:58,060
to give your firm
the rest of my business
this afternoon.

487
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:00,562
So, if you don't move
to have the charges
against me dismissed,

488
00:17:00,646 --> 00:17:02,022
I'll have her
do it for you.

489
00:17:12,491 --> 00:17:13,951
Harvey, I was just
on my way out.

490
00:17:14,034 --> 00:17:15,661
Well, you can be
on your way back in,

491
00:17:15,744 --> 00:17:17,162
because I just came
from Sutter's.

492
00:17:17,246 --> 00:17:19,164
I take it he told you
about our little
conversation today.

493
00:17:19,248 --> 00:17:21,792
If by conversation
you mean going
behind my back

494
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:23,210
and getting his
investment business,

495
00:17:23,293 --> 00:17:24,670
then yeah, he told me.

496
00:17:24,753 --> 00:17:26,422
I didn't go
behind your back.

497
00:17:26,505 --> 00:17:28,090
I saw an opportunity
and I took it.

498
00:17:28,173 --> 00:17:31,218
Well, now he's seeing
an opportunity
and he's taking it.

499
00:17:31,301 --> 00:17:32,302
What are you
talking about?

500
00:17:32,386 --> 00:17:33,846
He's leveraging
what you did

501
00:17:33,929 --> 00:17:36,140
to get me to move
for an immediate dismissal.

502
00:17:36,974 --> 00:17:38,684
And don't tell me,
you think
it's gonna work.

503
00:17:38,767 --> 00:17:39,852
I sure as hell do.

504
00:17:39,935 --> 00:17:41,145
And the second it does,

505
00:17:41,228 --> 00:17:44,022
Mike's chance at getting out
goes with it, thanks to you.

506
00:17:44,481 --> 00:17:45,774
Hang on there, tiger.

507
00:17:46,608 --> 00:17:48,736
You're not in this position
because of something I did.

508
00:17:48,819 --> 00:17:50,446
You're in it
because of Sutter.

509
00:17:50,529 --> 00:17:52,614
And he'd be
demanding you to have
this case dismissed

510
00:17:52,698 --> 00:17:54,450
whether we have his
other business or not.

511
00:17:54,533 --> 00:17:55,534
Well, that's not
the point.

512
00:17:55,617 --> 00:17:56,952
No, Harvey, the point is

513
00:17:57,035 --> 00:17:58,787
I have been out there
busting my ass

514
00:17:58,871 --> 00:18:01,415
trying to find us
new business for days.

515
00:18:01,498 --> 00:18:02,833
And do you know
what they keep asking?

516
00:18:03,167 --> 00:18:05,210
Why don't we have
Sutter's investment business?

517
00:18:05,294 --> 00:18:06,378
Goddamn right.

518
00:18:06,462 --> 00:18:08,547
We needed it,
I got it,

519
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:10,466
and now they're not
asking anymore.

520
00:18:11,842 --> 00:18:13,802
What's gonna happen
when we lose this case

521
00:18:13,886 --> 00:18:15,304
and his business goes away?

522
00:18:15,387 --> 00:18:16,555
What happens is

523
00:18:16,638 --> 00:18:18,599
we're already built
back up by then.

524
00:18:18,682 --> 00:18:20,392
So, instead of
blaming me

525
00:18:20,476 --> 00:18:22,186
for the position
Sutter has put you in,

526
00:18:22,269 --> 00:18:25,355
I suggest you go ahead
and find yourself
a way out of it.

527
00:18:31,987 --> 00:18:33,697
Rachel, what can I
do for you?

528
00:18:34,198 --> 00:18:36,784
I was hoping
you could do something
for Leonard Bailey.

529
00:18:36,867 --> 00:18:39,077
I drafted a motion
to reopen his case,

530
00:18:39,161 --> 00:18:41,163
but I need
a current member
of the Bar to file it.

531
00:18:41,246 --> 00:18:43,791
And what happened
to the person you said
was gonna take this on?

532
00:18:43,874 --> 00:18:45,083
She can't get to it
until later this week,

533
00:18:45,167 --> 00:18:46,627
but I want to get on this
as soon as possible.

534
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:48,128
Rachel, I'm sorry,
but I told you before,

535
00:18:48,212 --> 00:18:50,297
I don't have the resources
to work on this case now...

536
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:51,590
Professor,
this man has a wife

537
00:18:51,673 --> 00:18:54,468
who gave up on him
and children
that he doesn't see.

538
00:18:55,052 --> 00:18:57,262
His entire life
is passing him by,

539
00:18:57,387 --> 00:18:59,848
and the only way for him
to start getting it back

540
00:18:59,932 --> 00:19:03,227
is to just have someone
who cares enough
about him

541
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:06,563
that they give him
a half hour
of their time.

542
00:19:08,524 --> 00:19:10,526
Let me see your motion.

543
00:19:18,075 --> 00:19:19,076
(SIGHS)

544
00:19:20,369 --> 00:19:22,371
This is well drafted.
Thank you.

545
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,249
But I'm afraid
it won't work.

546
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:27,125
No, what are you
talking... No, look.

547
00:19:27,209 --> 00:19:28,585
There's no reason
that he should've
been convicted.

548
00:19:28,669 --> 00:19:30,295
Look at the evidence.
That's not the point.

549
00:19:30,379 --> 00:19:32,589
Rachel, I've worked
on dozens of these cases.

550
00:19:33,131 --> 00:19:34,675
And like it or not,
the standard to reopen

551
00:19:34,758 --> 00:19:36,260
is higher than what
it says in the books.

552
00:19:36,343 --> 00:19:39,263
You need
something undeniable.

553
00:19:39,972 --> 00:19:41,515
Then what am I
supposed to do?

554
00:19:41,598 --> 00:19:44,476
You're supposed
to use your gumption
to find that something

555
00:19:45,102 --> 00:19:47,813
and get Leonard Bailey
the justice
he's been waiting for.

556
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:54,528
Harvey, it's late.
Whatever you're doing here,

557
00:19:54,611 --> 00:19:55,988
it's gonna have
to wait until morning.

558
00:19:56,071 --> 00:19:57,698
It can't.
Why is that?

559
00:19:57,948 --> 00:19:59,283
Because Sutter
wants me to move

560
00:19:59,366 --> 00:20:01,034
for an
immediate dismissal.
What?

561
00:20:01,577 --> 00:20:03,203
You leveraged me into
bringing this indictment

562
00:20:03,287 --> 00:20:04,371
and now
you want to toss it?

563
00:20:04,454 --> 00:20:05,747
I don't want to toss it.

564
00:20:05,831 --> 00:20:06,832
But if I don't,

565
00:20:06,915 --> 00:20:08,709
he's gonna find
someone else who will.

566
00:20:08,792 --> 00:20:10,377
What are you doing
here, Harvey?

567
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:12,671
Nothing, I'm just
finishing my dinner.

568
00:20:12,754 --> 00:20:14,548
Thing is,
I don't like to litter.

569
00:20:14,631 --> 00:20:15,883
So, why don't you
do me a favor.

570
00:20:15,966 --> 00:20:18,176
If I forget this
when I go,

571
00:20:20,429 --> 00:20:22,514
why don't you
take it upstairs
and throw it away?

572
00:20:22,598 --> 00:20:23,765
What's in the bag,
Harvey?

573
00:20:24,141 --> 00:20:25,642
A wrapper,

574
00:20:25,726 --> 00:20:28,145
a couple napkins,
and a few extra fries.

575
00:20:28,228 --> 00:20:29,605
What the hell
is in the bag, Harvey?

576
00:20:29,897 --> 00:20:31,481
What you needed to keep
this case going

577
00:20:31,565 --> 00:20:32,983
and I stopped you
from getting.

578
00:20:33,066 --> 00:20:34,401
Damn it, you said
you were gonna defend him

579
00:20:34,484 --> 00:20:35,819
to the best
of your ability.

580
00:20:35,903 --> 00:20:37,696
And I meant it,
but I also knew

581
00:20:37,779 --> 00:20:41,283
if push came to shove,
I'd do what I had to
to get Mike out.

582
00:20:41,366 --> 00:20:42,743
And I made
my peace with it.

583
00:20:42,826 --> 00:20:44,453
Yeah, well, I haven't.
Yes, you have.

584
00:20:44,536 --> 00:20:45,579
What are you
talking about?

585
00:20:45,662 --> 00:20:48,248
You've been giving me
this song and dance

586
00:20:48,332 --> 00:20:51,460
about not colluding
and it didn't matter
what I said back to you

587
00:20:51,543 --> 00:20:53,003
as long as
it was something

588
00:20:53,086 --> 00:20:54,755
to let you believe
we wouldn't.

589
00:20:54,838 --> 00:20:57,674
Because that song
wasn't for me,
it was for you.

590
00:20:57,883 --> 00:20:59,051
Oh, for me?
Bullshit.

591
00:20:59,134 --> 00:21:00,427
I don't think so, Sean.

592
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:02,095
Because you don't break
a guy out of prison

593
00:21:02,179 --> 00:21:04,181
just to advance
your career.

594
00:21:05,015 --> 00:21:06,975
This means
something to you.

595
00:21:07,893 --> 00:21:08,977
I don't need to know
what it is,

596
00:21:09,061 --> 00:21:10,604
but it means something
to me, too.

597
00:21:10,687 --> 00:21:12,981
So, let's just admit
that we're in this together

598
00:21:13,065 --> 00:21:14,399
and get this thing done.

599
00:21:15,233 --> 00:21:17,611
Take that garbage
and throw it away.

600
00:21:27,371 --> 00:21:28,997
Now can I
have champagne?

601
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,792
You got the realtor
to give you
the key to the house.

602
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:33,460
Not only that,
I got him to agree

603
00:21:33,543 --> 00:21:34,962
to take the Kellmans
to brunch tomorrow

604
00:21:35,045 --> 00:21:37,464
from 10:00 to 2:00
to celebrate
their big sale.

605
00:21:37,547 --> 00:21:38,507
Well, that is great,
Donna,

606
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:40,133
but I don't just need
to get into the house,

607
00:21:40,217 --> 00:21:42,135
I need Tara to believe
that it's my house.

608
00:21:42,219 --> 00:21:43,637
Which means...
No lockbox on the door,

609
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:44,846
no for sale sign
in the yard,

610
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:46,390
and no personal belongings
in the house.

611
00:21:46,473 --> 00:21:48,684
Which is why we are
gonna be there at 10:01

612
00:21:48,767 --> 00:21:50,477
to stage the shit
out of that place.

613
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,312
Oh, and these are
coming with us.

614
00:21:56,191 --> 00:21:57,859
You reframed pictures
of Bruno.

615
00:21:58,235 --> 00:21:59,861
In the style of the house.

616
00:22:00,278 --> 00:22:01,571
And not just Bruno.

617
00:22:04,616 --> 00:22:05,826
Mikado.
(CHUCKLES)

618
00:22:06,702 --> 00:22:08,078
It's perfect, Donna.

619
00:22:08,704 --> 00:22:10,163
I just thought showing
Tara your wood

620
00:22:10,247 --> 00:22:12,624
wasn't the only way
to show her what
kind of man you are.

621
00:22:13,041 --> 00:22:14,167
Thank you, Donna.

622
00:22:14,543 --> 00:22:15,919
You're welcome, Louis.

623
00:22:19,256 --> 00:22:20,298
(SIGHS)

624
00:22:20,382 --> 00:22:21,633
Since when do
we get a room

625
00:22:21,717 --> 00:22:23,927
instead of having to use
those damn phones?

626
00:22:24,678 --> 00:22:27,180
Since I officially became
part of your legal team.

627
00:22:28,306 --> 00:22:29,683
My legal team?
That's right.

628
00:22:29,766 --> 00:22:32,269
The firm that I work for
is taking your case.

629
00:22:36,481 --> 00:22:37,774
After all this time.

630
00:22:40,444 --> 00:22:41,778
Thank you.

631
00:22:43,405 --> 00:22:44,948
You're welcome.

632
00:22:45,991 --> 00:22:48,201
But we still need to get
the case reopened.

633
00:22:48,285 --> 00:22:51,246
And to do that, we need
to find something new.

634
00:22:51,705 --> 00:22:52,831
So, where do we
get that?

635
00:22:53,123 --> 00:22:54,708
I was going through
the state's case file,

636
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:56,501
and I read
your police report.

637
00:22:56,585 --> 00:22:58,628
You said there was
a woman with you
that night

638
00:22:58,712 --> 00:23:01,715
who can testify
that you didn't kill
that couple.

639
00:23:01,798 --> 00:23:03,425
That's right. Maria.

640
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,218
But that's not new.

641
00:23:05,635 --> 00:23:07,471
Well, it's new as far as
the court's concerned,

642
00:23:07,554 --> 00:23:09,431
because it was
never admitted at trial.

643
00:23:09,514 --> 00:23:11,391
Well, let's admit it.
It's not that easy.

644
00:23:11,475 --> 00:23:13,226
I need to understand
why it was never admitted.

645
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:16,813
Because the damn woman
up and disappeared
before my trial.

646
00:23:17,522 --> 00:23:19,191
My lawyer
didn't do a thing.

647
00:23:19,274 --> 00:23:20,817
You had an alibi witness

648
00:23:20,901 --> 00:23:22,569
and your public defender
let her get away?

649
00:23:22,652 --> 00:23:23,820
That's what
I've been saying.

650
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:26,073
Maria could have
told the jury
that I didn't do it.

651
00:23:26,156 --> 00:23:27,783
Instead,
no one told them.

652
00:23:27,866 --> 00:23:29,493
Two weeks later,
I'm in here.

653
00:23:30,327 --> 00:23:31,828
And I've been here
ever since.

654
00:23:32,662 --> 00:23:34,539
Is there anything else
I need to know?

655
00:23:36,958 --> 00:23:38,835
Then I need to find
Maria Gomez.

656
00:23:47,511 --> 00:23:49,763
Look, man, please,
I really don't
want to talk.

657
00:23:49,846 --> 00:23:51,014
Good,

658
00:23:51,098 --> 00:23:52,390
'cause I just want
you to listen.

659
00:23:56,019 --> 00:23:57,354
When I was a kid,

660
00:23:58,146 --> 00:23:59,606
I thought we had it good.

661
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:02,025
And we did.
Had a nice house,

662
00:24:02,109 --> 00:24:03,276
nice neighborhood

663
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,945
except for one thing.

664
00:24:06,446 --> 00:24:08,198
Turns out my father

665
00:24:09,658 --> 00:24:10,992
was a criminal.

666
00:24:11,284 --> 00:24:13,078
One day, he got caught,
he went to prison,

667
00:24:13,161 --> 00:24:14,871
and my whole life
fell apart.

668
00:24:15,622 --> 00:24:17,040
How old were you?

669
00:24:18,083 --> 00:24:19,334
Fifteen.

670
00:24:20,836 --> 00:24:22,504
Let me tell you something.

671
00:24:22,587 --> 00:24:24,965
I hated that man for doing
what he did to me.

672
00:24:25,715 --> 00:24:28,218
So, I did what messed up
15-year-olds do.

673
00:24:29,219 --> 00:24:30,595
You started acting out.

674
00:24:30,887 --> 00:24:32,222
Acting out?

675
00:24:32,806 --> 00:24:36,143
Brother, I was on my way
to a place worse than this.

676
00:24:38,103 --> 00:24:40,230
Finally, my mom
made me see someone.

677
00:24:40,564 --> 00:24:42,524
And he helped me realize

678
00:24:42,899 --> 00:24:45,443
that if I didn't change,
I was gonna ruin my life.

679
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:49,072
So, I straightened out
and turned my life around.

680
00:24:49,614 --> 00:24:51,449
And that's why you do
what you do.

681
00:24:51,533 --> 00:24:52,617
Yeah.

682
00:24:55,162 --> 00:24:56,663
Why are you
telling me this?

683
00:24:56,746 --> 00:24:58,415
Because the way that man
got through to me

684
00:24:58,498 --> 00:25:00,417
was to open up
about himself.

685
00:25:01,084 --> 00:25:03,461
And I realize
that if I really want
to help you,

686
00:25:04,546 --> 00:25:06,131
I gotta do the same.

687
00:25:14,014 --> 00:25:15,849
All right, I dragged this out
as long as I can,

688
00:25:15,932 --> 00:25:17,601
but I'm pretty much done
drafting this motion,

689
00:25:17,684 --> 00:25:18,685
so I'll need you
to proof it, then...

690
00:25:18,768 --> 00:25:20,145
Harvey, before I do that,

691
00:25:20,228 --> 00:25:21,563
I think you should
take a look at these.

692
00:25:21,646 --> 00:25:23,523
What is it?
Cahill issued subpoenas

693
00:25:23,607 --> 00:25:25,984
to deposition
William Sutter
and Kevin Miller.

694
00:25:26,067 --> 00:25:27,694
That sneaky
son of a bitch.

695
00:25:27,777 --> 00:25:28,778
Why are you smiling?

696
00:25:28,862 --> 00:25:30,322
Because last night
I went to Cahill

697
00:25:30,405 --> 00:25:32,240
and tried to give him
Sutter's trading program.

698
00:25:33,158 --> 00:25:34,201
You did what?

699
00:25:34,284 --> 00:25:35,952
It was the only way
I could see to stop the case

700
00:25:36,036 --> 00:25:38,246
from getting dismissed.
But he wouldn't take it.

701
00:25:38,622 --> 00:25:39,873
And this buys you time.

702
00:25:39,956 --> 00:25:42,292
It does if the judge waits
to rule on our motion

703
00:25:42,375 --> 00:25:44,336
until after Cahill conducts
these depositions.

704
00:25:45,212 --> 00:25:46,213
Harvey,
even if that works,

705
00:25:46,296 --> 00:25:47,380
what if Cahill
doesn't get enough

706
00:25:47,464 --> 00:25:49,049
from the depositions
to keep the case alive?

707
00:25:49,132 --> 00:25:51,134
Then Mike's chance
of getting out
of prison is gone.

708
00:25:51,218 --> 00:25:52,886
Which means Cahill's
not the only one

709
00:25:52,969 --> 00:25:55,680
that needs to use this
to try and get something.

710
00:25:58,808 --> 00:26:00,018
I have to admit,
Miss Zane,

711
00:26:00,101 --> 00:26:01,811
when you said
you were looking
into the Bailey case,

712
00:26:01,895 --> 00:26:03,146
my interest
was piqued.

713
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:04,689
That was a long time ago.

714
00:26:04,898 --> 00:26:06,441
Well, you've obviously
come a long way

715
00:26:06,524 --> 00:26:07,776
since your public
defender days.

716
00:26:07,859 --> 00:26:09,236
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)
You don't exactly see

717
00:26:09,319 --> 00:26:11,238
the best of humanity
at that job,

718
00:26:11,321 --> 00:26:13,823
which makes it one
you can only do
for so long.

719
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:16,284
But you didn't come here
to be my therapist.

720
00:26:16,368 --> 00:26:19,162
No, I came to talk
about Maria Gomez.

721
00:26:19,246 --> 00:26:20,247
What about her?

722
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:21,998
I'm curious as to
how you can have

723
00:26:22,082 --> 00:26:23,458
an alibi witness
on a murder case

724
00:26:23,541 --> 00:26:25,377
and your client
ends up on death row.

725
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:27,295
Because I didn't have
an alibi witness.

726
00:26:27,379 --> 00:26:29,256
I had a no-show
who vanished
into thin air

727
00:26:29,339 --> 00:26:31,132
and I didn't have
the resources
to find her.

728
00:26:31,216 --> 00:26:33,218
And you didn't think
to ask the police at trial

729
00:26:33,301 --> 00:26:35,262
why they didn't follow up
on Leonard's alibi?

730
00:26:35,345 --> 00:26:36,346
I did think of it,

731
00:26:36,429 --> 00:26:38,098
and they would have said
what they always say.

732
00:26:38,181 --> 00:26:39,975
Every murderer claims
to have an alibi.

733
00:26:40,058 --> 00:26:41,893
And if I couldn't
produce her,
why should they?

734
00:26:41,977 --> 00:26:43,645
Well, you could have at least
asked for a postponement

735
00:26:43,728 --> 00:26:44,938
to have time to find her.

736
00:26:45,021 --> 00:26:46,773
And I would have,
except for one thing.

737
00:26:46,856 --> 00:26:49,109
I wasn't sure a drug addict
with a prior conviction

738
00:26:49,192 --> 00:26:51,361
would have done
Leonard Bailey much good.

739
00:26:51,778 --> 00:26:53,697
That's about her character,
not the facts of the case.

740
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:55,991
Her character
is a fact of the case.

741
00:26:56,074 --> 00:26:57,951
And when I pressed her
as to what the two of them

742
00:26:58,034 --> 00:26:59,077
were doing at the time
of those murders,

743
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,037
she admitted they were
both on meth,

744
00:27:01,121 --> 00:27:02,706
and it wasn't
the first time.

745
00:27:03,206 --> 00:27:04,624
Which, by the way,
might have something to do

746
00:27:04,708 --> 00:27:06,543
with why she never
showed up at trial.

747
00:27:07,544 --> 00:27:10,463
So, you can try
to reopen this case
if you want, Ms. Zane.

748
00:27:10,547 --> 00:27:13,383
But I am telling you,
you're wasting your time.

749
00:27:20,682 --> 00:27:21,891
What's going on?

750
00:27:22,726 --> 00:27:25,103
What's going on is
the clock's ticking.

751
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,689
Sutter wants me to get
the case dismissed.

752
00:27:28,106 --> 00:27:29,941
What?
If that happens...
I know.

753
00:27:30,025 --> 00:27:31,067
Now, listen to me.

754
00:27:31,151 --> 00:27:32,652
I bought us
a little time,

755
00:27:33,403 --> 00:27:34,738
but I need you
to do something.

756
00:27:35,655 --> 00:27:36,740
Okay.

757
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:40,785
What is it?
Sutter doesn't
know this yet.

758
00:27:40,869 --> 00:27:42,287
But he and I are gonna
be here tomorrow

759
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:44,664
to have a practice
deposition with Kevin.

760
00:27:44,748 --> 00:27:47,292
So, I need you to do
the best Sean Cahill

761
00:27:47,375 --> 00:27:48,752
you have
to get them talking.

762
00:27:48,835 --> 00:27:50,253
You want me
in the room?

763
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:52,881
I don't think
that's a good idea.

764
00:27:52,964 --> 00:27:54,799
Didn't you hear me?
We're running
out of time.

765
00:27:54,883 --> 00:27:56,593
I heard you,
but I don't think
it's a good idea

766
00:27:56,676 --> 00:27:59,012
for me to be
in the same room
as Kevin right now.

767
00:27:59,095 --> 00:28:00,180
The drunk driving.

768
00:28:00,513 --> 00:28:02,349
You knew?
I just found out.

769
00:28:02,807 --> 00:28:03,808
Well, then,
you also know

770
00:28:03,892 --> 00:28:05,769
it's probably not
the best time for me
to chum up to him.

771
00:28:05,852 --> 00:28:07,312
I'm not asking you
to chum up to him.

772
00:28:07,395 --> 00:28:09,105
I'm asking you
to piss him off.

773
00:28:09,689 --> 00:28:10,982
What are you
talking about?

774
00:28:11,066 --> 00:28:13,818
Kevin knows something
and he's not talking.

775
00:28:14,235 --> 00:28:16,613
So, we could
sit around here
for the next two years

776
00:28:16,696 --> 00:28:17,781
waiting for him
to tell you,

777
00:28:17,864 --> 00:28:19,616
or we can light a fire
under his ass

778
00:28:19,699 --> 00:28:23,411
by reminding him
that Sutter's out there
while he's in here.

779
00:28:23,953 --> 00:28:25,622
Now, are you
with me or not?

780
00:28:28,583 --> 00:28:29,709
I'm with you.

781
00:28:35,673 --> 00:28:38,051
I take it you're here
to give me the good news.

782
00:28:38,134 --> 00:28:39,260
I'm afraid not.

783
00:28:39,511 --> 00:28:41,346
I thought
I made myself clear.

784
00:28:41,429 --> 00:28:42,430
If you don't make
a motion to dismiss...

785
00:28:42,514 --> 00:28:44,140
I did file
a motion to dismiss,

786
00:28:44,224 --> 00:28:45,892
but it doesn't matter
because Cahill

787
00:28:45,975 --> 00:28:48,978
filed subpoenas
to depose you
and your son-in-law first.

788
00:28:49,062 --> 00:28:51,231
And until those
depositions happen,

789
00:28:51,314 --> 00:28:53,149
the court won't file
on the motion.

790
00:28:53,233 --> 00:28:54,275
Goddamn it.

791
00:28:54,359 --> 00:28:55,652
How the hell
did he know to do that

792
00:28:55,735 --> 00:28:56,778
when we're about to have
the case thrown out?

793
00:28:56,861 --> 00:28:59,948
I don't know,
but that's not what
I came here to talk about.

794
00:29:00,031 --> 00:29:01,991
Because we need
to get you
and Kevin Miller

795
00:29:02,075 --> 00:29:03,993
in a room to prepare you
for your deposition.

796
00:29:04,661 --> 00:29:05,662
You want us
to go prison?

797
00:29:05,745 --> 00:29:06,871
Look, I don't see
any other choice.

798
00:29:06,955 --> 00:29:08,373
So, you should call
whoever it is

799
00:29:08,456 --> 00:29:10,166
you were gonna meet
this morning and tell them
you can't make it,

800
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:12,043
because you and I
are going to Danbury.

801
00:29:24,097 --> 00:29:26,307
Were you really
serious about wanting
to help me?

802
00:29:26,391 --> 00:29:28,893
Why do I get
the feeling that's not
a simple question?

803
00:29:30,186 --> 00:29:33,815
Because I want to know
if you're willing to give me
access to certain records.

804
00:29:34,649 --> 00:29:35,692
I'm, I'm sorry, Mike.

805
00:29:35,775 --> 00:29:37,694
I cannot give information
on other inmates.

806
00:29:37,777 --> 00:29:40,363
Well, that's okay,
because those aren't
the records I'm looking for.

807
00:29:42,407 --> 00:29:43,741
Did you find Maria?

808
00:29:45,368 --> 00:29:48,329
You know, I haven't even
started looking for her yet.

809
00:29:49,581 --> 00:29:51,374
Because you lied to me.

810
00:29:51,458 --> 00:29:52,542
What?

811
00:29:54,419 --> 00:29:55,962
I didn't lie to you
about shit.

812
00:29:57,005 --> 00:29:58,298
Well, you certainly
didn't tell me

813
00:29:58,381 --> 00:30:00,925
that you and Maria
were high the night
of those murders.

814
00:30:01,009 --> 00:30:02,093
(SIGHS)

815
00:30:02,177 --> 00:30:04,387
Well, who told you that?
Georgina Casey.

816
00:30:04,888 --> 00:30:07,807
You went to see
my old lawyer?
Yes, I did.

817
00:30:09,684 --> 00:30:11,728
And now you're
sitting over there
looking at me like,

818
00:30:12,687 --> 00:30:13,897
you know...

819
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:16,191
"Maybe he could've killed
those people after all."

820
00:30:16,274 --> 00:30:18,860
Leonard, when I went
into that meeting,
I was on your side.

821
00:30:18,943 --> 00:30:21,237
And you came
out of it, off it.

822
00:30:21,321 --> 00:30:23,364
No. When I came out of it,
I had questions.

823
00:30:23,448 --> 00:30:24,782
Okay, ask them!

824
00:30:25,325 --> 00:30:27,118
I got nothing to hide.
Really?

825
00:30:27,535 --> 00:30:29,454
Because you hid something
from me the last time.

826
00:30:29,537 --> 00:30:31,289
That was different.
No, it's relevant.

827
00:30:31,372 --> 00:30:32,332
No, it isn't.

828
00:30:32,415 --> 00:30:34,501
You were high
the night of the murders

829
00:30:34,584 --> 00:30:36,127
and you lied
to me about it.

830
00:30:36,211 --> 00:30:38,546
Because I'm ashamed
of how I used to be!

831
00:30:39,547 --> 00:30:42,634
I was a high-school dropout
on my way nowhere.

832
00:30:43,092 --> 00:30:44,302
So, yeah.

833
00:30:44,677 --> 00:30:47,388
I looked for an escape
when I could afford one.

834
00:30:47,764 --> 00:30:49,682
I'm not saying I didn't
make some mistakes

835
00:30:49,766 --> 00:30:51,851
or maybe even
commit a few crimes.

836
00:30:51,935 --> 00:30:53,603
But killing those kids

837
00:30:55,188 --> 00:30:56,564
was not one of them.

838
00:30:58,566 --> 00:31:00,109
And that's the truth.

839
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:02,153
But I guess
it doesn't matter.

840
00:31:02,237 --> 00:31:04,113
Because if you
don't find Maria,

841
00:31:04,405 --> 00:31:06,866
someday they're gonna
walk me down that hall

842
00:31:07,242 --> 00:31:08,493
and put me to death.

843
00:31:08,952 --> 00:31:11,454
Then I guess I'd better
get back to finding her.

844
00:31:11,829 --> 00:31:13,456
But, Leonard,
I'm telling you,

845
00:31:15,124 --> 00:31:17,252
if you're not
straight with me,

846
00:31:18,253 --> 00:31:19,629
this isn't gonna work.

847
00:31:20,213 --> 00:31:23,633
Then I won't ever
leave anything out again.

848
00:31:27,303 --> 00:31:29,556
This is ridiculous.
This kid's no Sean Cahill.

849
00:31:29,639 --> 00:31:32,475
This kid made
Sean Cahill
look like a fool

850
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:34,227
without even having
a law degree.

851
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:36,729
Just so you know,
when you attack
opposing counsel,

852
00:31:36,813 --> 00:31:37,814
it kind of makes
you look afraid.

853
00:31:37,897 --> 00:31:40,108
(SCOFFS) I'm not
afraid of you.

854
00:31:41,025 --> 00:31:42,986
Okay. Then why don't
you tell me this?

855
00:31:43,611 --> 00:31:46,030
What's the best thing
about having
so much money?

856
00:31:46,531 --> 00:31:48,074
What?
You heard me.

857
00:31:48,157 --> 00:31:49,576
You've got the penthouse
in Manhattan.

858
00:31:49,659 --> 00:31:51,286
You've got the villa
in the south of France.

859
00:31:51,369 --> 00:31:52,745
You've got
two yachts.
So, what?

860
00:31:52,829 --> 00:31:53,913
MIKE: So, what?

861
00:31:54,497 --> 00:31:56,583
I wouldn't want
to give all of that up.
Would you, Mr. Miller?

862
00:31:57,709 --> 00:31:59,127
Me?
Yeah, you.

863
00:31:59,711 --> 00:32:02,297
I mean,
you had use of all
of these places, too.

864
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:04,465
Until you threw it
all away driving drunk,
that is.

865
00:32:04,549 --> 00:32:06,301
What?
Objection, irrelevant.

866
00:32:06,384 --> 00:32:07,427
MIKE: I think
it's very relevant.

867
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:09,429
For all I know,
Kevin could be
somehow involved.

868
00:32:09,512 --> 00:32:10,930
That's insane.
That's insane?

869
00:32:11,014 --> 00:32:12,599
You're the developer
of the trading software.

870
00:32:12,682 --> 00:32:14,100
And I'm not the one
who's on trial here.

871
00:32:14,183 --> 00:32:16,185
Then let's talk about
the one who is.

872
00:32:16,811 --> 00:32:18,479
How do you feel
about the fact
that your father-in-law

873
00:32:18,563 --> 00:32:19,856
never came to visit you
in prison?

874
00:32:20,815 --> 00:32:22,442
Excuse me?
You heard me.

875
00:32:22,525 --> 00:32:23,943
He hasn't come
to see you once.

876
00:32:24,027 --> 00:32:25,069
How does that
make you feel?

877
00:32:25,153 --> 00:32:26,279
It doesn't
matter to me.

878
00:32:26,362 --> 00:32:27,655
It... (LAUGHS)

879
00:32:28,197 --> 00:32:30,450
He could be lying
on a beach in the
French Riviera

880
00:32:30,533 --> 00:32:31,993
while you can
barely see
your wife and kids.

881
00:32:32,076 --> 00:32:33,119
And that doesn't
matter to you?

882
00:32:33,202 --> 00:32:36,289
Mr. Miller's family
has nothing to do
with this investigation.

883
00:32:36,372 --> 00:32:38,291
Mr. Miller's family
is the subject
of this investigation.

884
00:32:38,374 --> 00:32:39,959
And his father-in-law
clearly doesn't
give a shit.

885
00:32:40,043 --> 00:32:42,295
I'm grateful for everything
Kevin's done for me
and he knows it.

886
00:32:42,378 --> 00:32:43,588
(SCOFFS)
Yeah, right.

887
00:32:44,213 --> 00:32:45,965
I'm sorry,
what was that?

888
00:32:46,049 --> 00:32:47,717
Are you disputing
the fact that
he's grateful to you?

889
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,510
I'm not answering
that question.

890
00:32:49,594 --> 00:32:50,637
This isn't
getting us anywhere.

891
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,055
He's getting you
ready for Cahill.

892
00:32:52,138 --> 00:32:53,389
I wouldn't have
to get ready for Cahill

893
00:32:53,473 --> 00:32:54,641
if you'd done
your goddamn job

894
00:32:54,724 --> 00:32:56,517
and gotten
this case dismissed.
KEVIN: That's right,

895
00:32:56,601 --> 00:32:58,603
get someone else
to cover up your mess
like you always do.

896
00:32:58,895 --> 00:32:59,854
You got something
you wanna say to me?

897
00:32:59,937 --> 00:33:00,980
I got something
I wanna do to you.

898
00:33:01,064 --> 00:33:02,273
You better remember
who you're talking to.

899
00:33:02,357 --> 00:33:03,566
I know exactly
who I'm talking to.

900
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:05,068
The guy that doesn't give
a shit about anyone else

901
00:33:05,151 --> 00:33:06,319
other than himself.
That's enough!

902
00:33:06,402 --> 00:33:07,403
That is enough!

903
00:33:07,487 --> 00:33:08,988
This is your trial,
it's not mine.

904
00:33:09,072 --> 00:33:11,658
And I'm done with this
and I'm done with you.

905
00:33:14,202 --> 00:33:15,328
Guard.

906
00:33:15,411 --> 00:33:16,579
(BANGS DOOR)

907
00:33:24,962 --> 00:33:26,339
Son of a bitch.

908
00:33:26,422 --> 00:33:27,674
I knew that kid
would be a problem.

909
00:33:27,757 --> 00:33:30,426
Relax.
That's the whole reason
I wanted Mike in here.

910
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:31,803
If Kevin gets
any funny ideas,

911
00:33:31,886 --> 00:33:34,097
Mike's gonna
calm him down,
then let us know.

912
00:33:47,568 --> 00:33:49,320
You guys really get
under each other's skin,
don't you?

913
00:33:49,779 --> 00:33:50,863
You have no idea
how many times

914
00:33:50,947 --> 00:33:53,825
I've thought about punching
that bastard in his smug face.

915
00:33:53,908 --> 00:33:55,576
I'm guessing
he's thought about
punching you, too.

916
00:33:56,911 --> 00:33:58,496
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

917
00:33:59,497 --> 00:34:01,541
It means his daughter
married a criminal.

918
00:34:01,624 --> 00:34:02,792
He's got
to live with that.

919
00:34:02,875 --> 00:34:04,085
You know what?
I've had just
about enough

920
00:34:04,168 --> 00:34:05,837
of you giving me shit
for what I did.

921
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,088
Well, maybe I'll stop
giving you shit

922
00:34:07,213 --> 00:34:09,090
when your story
starts adding up.
Excuse me?

923
00:34:09,173 --> 00:34:10,758
You said you got
three years
for drunk driving.

924
00:34:10,842 --> 00:34:13,219
But you've got no priors
and this guy made
a full recovery.

925
00:34:13,302 --> 00:34:14,470
Ninety-nine times
out of a hundred,

926
00:34:14,554 --> 00:34:15,972
that means you're
getting probation.

927
00:34:16,055 --> 00:34:17,724
Then I guess I had
shitty representation.

928
00:34:17,807 --> 00:34:20,059
Bullshit.
Money like yours doesn't
buy shitty representation.

929
00:34:20,143 --> 00:34:21,269
Then I don't know
what to tell you.

930
00:34:21,352 --> 00:34:23,730
How about you start
with telling me
the goddamn truth?

931
00:34:23,813 --> 00:34:24,981
You want to know
the truth? I'll tell you,

932
00:34:25,064 --> 00:34:27,191
because I'm sick
of holding it in, man.

933
00:34:28,651 --> 00:34:29,736
I got three years

934
00:34:29,819 --> 00:34:31,738
because when they
offered me a deal
to turn on him,

935
00:34:31,821 --> 00:34:33,114
I said no.

936
00:34:33,197 --> 00:34:34,741
You had
to turn them down.
He didn't do it.

937
00:34:34,824 --> 00:34:35,992
No, I had
to turn them down

938
00:34:36,075 --> 00:34:38,369
because he's not
the only one involved.

939
00:34:39,954 --> 00:34:41,038
What?

940
00:34:45,126 --> 00:34:47,837
You asked me
why I was drinking
that night.

941
00:34:48,212 --> 00:34:49,422
It was because
I found out

942
00:34:49,505 --> 00:34:50,548
the thing that
I worked so hard on

943
00:34:50,631 --> 00:34:53,134
to get that prick's
approval was nothing
but a lie.

944
00:34:53,676 --> 00:34:56,053
Your trading program.
Yeah, my program.

945
00:34:56,888 --> 00:34:58,139
Turns out he wasn't
using it at all.

946
00:34:58,222 --> 00:34:59,849
He was just
insider trading
the whole time.

947
00:35:01,225 --> 00:35:02,769
Okay, so,
you got home,

948
00:35:03,436 --> 00:35:05,813
you told Jill,
and she didn't
believe you.

949
00:35:06,856 --> 00:35:08,107
No, Mike.

950
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,277
She not only
believed me, she...

951
00:35:12,737 --> 00:35:14,113
She already knew.

952
00:35:14,781 --> 00:35:17,158
(SIGHS)
She was in on it.
Yeah.

953
00:35:17,825 --> 00:35:19,869
So, I went out
and I got drunk.

954
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,747
And the next thing I knew,
I had to choose

955
00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:24,916
between going to prison
for three years

956
00:35:24,999 --> 00:35:29,086
or the mother of
my children going away
for a whole lot more.

957
00:35:30,379 --> 00:35:31,672
Kevin,

958
00:35:31,756 --> 00:35:32,840
you've got...

959
00:35:40,723 --> 00:35:42,099
DONNA: Okay, I...

960
00:35:42,517 --> 00:35:44,477
Have removed
every possible trace

961
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,896
of the Kellmans' existence
and replaced it with yours.

962
00:35:46,979 --> 00:35:49,190
Now, all I have to do
is fill the refrigerator

963
00:35:49,273 --> 00:35:50,566
with prune juice
and then I've got
to set up the...

964
00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:51,734
Okay, get out.

965
00:35:52,235 --> 00:35:53,277
What? What do you
mean, get out?

966
00:35:53,361 --> 00:35:54,403
I haven't set up the...
She's pulling up.

967
00:35:54,487 --> 00:35:56,906
She's here, and I don't want
her to see us together
and get the wrong idea.

968
00:35:57,698 --> 00:35:59,408
And exactly
what idea is that?

969
00:35:59,492 --> 00:36:00,993
Okay.
Don't you understand?

970
00:36:01,077 --> 00:36:02,578
No woman could
compete with you

971
00:36:02,662 --> 00:36:03,996
if she thought
there was even a chance

972
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,081
of you and I
being together.

973
00:36:05,289 --> 00:36:06,499
Really?
No, she blows you away.

974
00:36:06,582 --> 00:36:08,543
Now, get
the hell out and use
the service entrance.

975
00:36:12,129 --> 00:36:13,130
(SIGHS)

976
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,091
Tara, you're here.

977
00:36:16,425 --> 00:36:18,553
Oh, my God.

978
00:36:18,636 --> 00:36:19,846
Louis,

979
00:36:19,929 --> 00:36:21,597
this place
is wonderful.

980
00:36:21,681 --> 00:36:23,015
How long
have you had it?

981
00:36:23,099 --> 00:36:24,976
(CHUCKLES)
I've had it
for generations.

982
00:36:25,059 --> 00:36:27,228
Great Grandma Litt,
she used to make wool

983
00:36:27,770 --> 00:36:29,355
right over there
by the fire.

984
00:36:29,438 --> 00:36:31,107
The natural light
is phenomenal.

985
00:36:32,149 --> 00:36:33,401
Phenomenal.

986
00:36:33,943 --> 00:36:37,780
There's a wildness
to the landscape.
An uninhibited energy.

987
00:36:38,948 --> 00:36:40,074
Wild.

988
00:36:40,783 --> 00:36:42,201
Uninhibited.

989
00:36:43,661 --> 00:36:45,454
It's perfect for us,
Louis.

990
00:36:48,666 --> 00:36:50,084
I'm glad you like it.

991
00:36:50,626 --> 00:36:52,503
I don't just like it.
I love it.

992
00:36:52,837 --> 00:36:54,297
Just like I love you.

993
00:36:58,426 --> 00:36:59,844
Oh, Tara, I love you.

994
00:36:59,927 --> 00:37:01,262
What?

995
00:37:01,679 --> 00:37:02,972
It, your idea.

996
00:37:03,055 --> 00:37:04,056
What you were talking
about earlier?

997
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:05,349
Which idea?
What happened?

998
00:37:05,433 --> 00:37:06,434
(DOOR OPENS)
Louis, are you okay?

999
00:37:06,517 --> 00:37:08,227
What the hell
is going on here?

1000
00:37:09,061 --> 00:37:10,062
Nothing's going on here.

1001
00:37:10,146 --> 00:37:11,230
What the hell are you
doing in my house?

1002
00:37:11,314 --> 00:37:12,315
Your house?

1003
00:37:12,398 --> 00:37:13,399
Louis, who are
these people?

1004
00:37:13,482 --> 00:37:15,818
These people are the
registered owners
of this property.

1005
00:37:16,819 --> 00:37:19,947
You mean the one you said
had been in your family
for generations?

1006
00:37:20,031 --> 00:37:22,116
That's a lie.
We built this
house ourselves,

1007
00:37:22,199 --> 00:37:24,994
and until five minutes ago,
we were gonna
sell it to him.

1008
00:37:26,746 --> 00:37:28,122
Tara, I can explain.

1009
00:37:28,205 --> 00:37:30,958
I don't need
you to explain.
I've heard enough.

1010
00:37:31,042 --> 00:37:32,251
Tara, wait.

1011
00:37:32,335 --> 00:37:33,544
Please.

1012
00:37:34,337 --> 00:37:35,338
Tara, please wait.

1013
00:37:35,421 --> 00:37:38,007
You know, I've heard
about people like you.

1014
00:37:38,507 --> 00:37:40,051
You're trying
to get free design
work out of me

1015
00:37:40,134 --> 00:37:42,595
so you can decide
whether or not you want
to buy this house.

1016
00:37:42,762 --> 00:37:43,930
That has nothing
to do with it.

1017
00:37:44,013 --> 00:37:45,348
Really? Because first,

1018
00:37:45,431 --> 00:37:46,557
you tried to get me
to work on this

1019
00:37:46,641 --> 00:37:48,142
without even
seeing the space.

1020
00:37:48,225 --> 00:37:49,936
Then you lured me out here
under false pretenses.

1021
00:37:50,019 --> 00:37:52,688
So, why don't you
tell me what exactly
is going on here?

1022
00:37:52,772 --> 00:37:54,523
I lied to you
about owning a house
in the Hamptons

1023
00:37:54,607 --> 00:37:56,192
so I could spend
time with you.

1024
00:37:57,652 --> 00:37:59,987
What? Why?
Why would you do that?

1025
00:38:00,071 --> 00:38:01,656
Because you are perfect,

1026
00:38:01,739 --> 00:38:03,032
and beautiful,

1027
00:38:03,783 --> 00:38:05,034
and intelligent,

1028
00:38:05,326 --> 00:38:06,911
and talented.

1029
00:38:06,994 --> 00:38:09,830
And so far
out of my league

1030
00:38:10,915 --> 00:38:12,833
it was the only thing
that I could come up with

1031
00:38:12,917 --> 00:38:15,503
to find the time I needed
to make you fall for me.

1032
00:38:16,504 --> 00:38:18,464
You were willing
to buy and remodel

1033
00:38:18,547 --> 00:38:20,049
an entire house
to do that?

1034
00:38:21,133 --> 00:38:22,301
I was.

1035
00:38:22,843 --> 00:38:25,930
That's the most
romantic thing
I've ever heard.

1036
00:38:27,348 --> 00:38:28,557
Really?

1037
00:38:29,892 --> 00:38:31,560
Yeah. Yes, really.
(CHUCKLES)

1038
00:38:33,354 --> 00:38:35,314
Tara, would you like
to have dinner with me?

1039
00:38:36,482 --> 00:38:38,234
I'd love to, Louis.

1040
00:38:39,777 --> 00:38:41,112
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

1041
00:38:49,412 --> 00:38:51,455
RACHEL:
What are you working on?

1042
00:38:51,539 --> 00:38:52,748
An engagement letter.

1043
00:38:54,166 --> 00:38:55,167
You got a new client.

1044
00:38:55,251 --> 00:38:56,752
I got us two new clients.

1045
00:38:58,170 --> 00:39:00,339
So, that's what you had
to do the other day.

1046
00:39:00,423 --> 00:39:02,008
Well, something like that.

1047
00:39:02,091 --> 00:39:04,301
The one I got the other day
led to the one I got today.

1048
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:06,887
That's great.

1049
00:39:07,263 --> 00:39:08,681
Yeah, what's
on your mind?

1050
00:39:12,226 --> 00:39:15,146
I know you said
that you'd give me
an hour of your time

1051
00:39:15,229 --> 00:39:17,398
later this week,
but I need
that hour tonight.

1052
00:39:18,024 --> 00:39:19,608
Rachel, it's been
a long day.

1053
00:39:19,692 --> 00:39:20,985
Can we talk about this
in the morning?

1054
00:39:21,068 --> 00:39:22,403
No, Jessica, we can't.

1055
00:39:25,322 --> 00:39:27,533
Leonard Bailey's
execution date's been set.

1056
00:39:29,827 --> 00:39:32,621
And I don't know
how to tell a man
that he's going to die.

1057
00:39:40,254 --> 00:39:43,632
You know, I always knew
that Jill and I were
from two different worlds.

1058
00:39:45,968 --> 00:39:47,428
I mean,
she was a Sutter

1059
00:39:48,304 --> 00:39:49,263
and I was just...

1060
00:39:49,346 --> 00:39:52,141
A guy who was good
with numbers
and didn't have much else.

1061
00:39:54,935 --> 00:39:56,228
I figured it was only
a matter of time

1062
00:39:56,312 --> 00:39:57,938
before she came
to her senses.

1063
00:39:59,315 --> 00:40:00,483
But she never did.

1064
00:40:01,525 --> 00:40:02,902
And let me guess.

1065
00:40:03,527 --> 00:40:05,154
William never
accepted it.

1066
00:40:06,655 --> 00:40:09,825
So, when he asked me
to develop that algorithm,
I thought...

1067
00:40:10,493 --> 00:40:11,952
This was my chance.

1068
00:40:13,412 --> 00:40:16,332
And when I gave it to him,
he acted so proud.

1069
00:40:17,166 --> 00:40:19,210
Started calling me
his genius son-in-law.

1070
00:40:20,586 --> 00:40:22,338
But I was really just
the world's biggest sucker,

1071
00:40:22,421 --> 00:40:23,464
because I let that
son of a bitch

1072
00:40:23,547 --> 00:40:24,590
get one over on me

1073
00:40:24,673 --> 00:40:27,176
and I'll regret it
for the rest of my life.

1074
00:40:29,345 --> 00:40:31,972
What if you could get
one over on him?

1075
00:40:33,766 --> 00:40:35,810
What are you
talking about?

1076
00:40:38,104 --> 00:40:39,980
You said yourself
they offered you a deal.

1077
00:40:40,064 --> 00:40:41,565
I bet they'd
still take it.

1078
00:40:41,649 --> 00:40:42,691
No way.

1079
00:40:43,192 --> 00:40:44,985
If I give them him,
they go after her.

1080
00:40:45,069 --> 00:40:47,738
Not if you get them
to give Jill
immunity first.

1081
00:40:47,822 --> 00:40:48,948
No.
Kevin, you have to.

1082
00:40:49,031 --> 00:40:50,324
It's too big a risk.

1083
00:40:51,659 --> 00:40:52,952
And, and you're my
father-in-law's lawyer.

1084
00:40:53,035 --> 00:40:54,036
You can't even be
saying this to me.

1085
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:55,121
I am nobody's lawyer.

1086
00:40:55,204 --> 00:40:56,413
I am your friend,
and I am saying...

1087
00:40:56,497 --> 00:40:57,832
Well, my answer's no.

1088
00:40:57,915 --> 00:40:59,166
And I want your
word right now

1089
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:00,960
that you won't tell
anyone what I told you.

1090
00:41:01,043 --> 00:41:02,378
Kevin, please...
Mike, I'm serious.

1091
00:41:02,461 --> 00:41:06,048
No one can
ever know anything
about what I told you.

1092
00:41:09,718 --> 00:41:11,053
You have my word.

1093
00:41:20,062 --> 00:41:22,231
Did I ever tell you
my mother was a teacher?

1094
00:41:23,816 --> 00:41:25,234
First grade.

1095
00:41:26,986 --> 00:41:30,114
Everybody always said
she was the best teacher
their kid ever had.

1096
00:41:31,073 --> 00:41:32,324
And she loved it.

1097
00:41:34,493 --> 00:41:37,997
But she also always
dreamed of seeing Spain
when she retired.

1098
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:41,500
That was supposed
to be six years ago.

1099
00:41:42,543 --> 00:41:44,128
But then the
State Teachers
Pension fund

1100
00:41:44,211 --> 00:41:46,005
decided to invest
its money with

1101
00:41:46,922 --> 00:41:48,382
William Sutter.

1102
00:41:51,886 --> 00:41:54,847
She died last year,
still working.

1103
00:41:56,015 --> 00:41:57,266
And every year,
I tried to pay
for her trip,

1104
00:41:57,349 --> 00:41:58,934
but she just
wouldn't let me.

1105
00:41:59,393 --> 00:42:01,228
Sean, why are you
telling me this?

1106
00:42:01,645 --> 00:42:04,982
Because the judge decided
to rule on your motion
to dismiss after all.

1107
00:42:06,442 --> 00:42:08,402
Which means
we're out of time.

1108
00:42:08,485 --> 00:42:10,779
And you didn't just
come here to tell me
about your mother.

1109
00:42:13,365 --> 00:42:14,450
No.

1110
00:42:15,451 --> 00:42:17,620
I came here to ask
for that trading program.

1111
00:42:18,766 --> 00:42:23,813
