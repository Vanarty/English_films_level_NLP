00:00:32,741 --> 00:00:34,952
<i>All right, let's try somethin' else.</i>

3
00:00:37,746 --> 00:00:42,334
{\an8}<i>Uh, from the top.
Ready. One, two, three.</i>

4
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:54,304
One, two, three, four.

5
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:56,932
Stay on the beat.

6
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:59,017
Two, three, four.

7
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:05,357
That's C-sharp, horns.

8
00:01:06,859 --> 00:01:09,194
Two, three...
I see you, Caleb.

9
00:01:10,946 --> 00:01:11,947
Rachel, now you.

10
00:01:12,364 --> 00:01:14,408
Forgot my sax, Mr G.

11
00:01:14,575 --> 00:01:18,954
Okay, she forgot her sax.
And now, all you, Connie.

12
00:01:19,121 --> 00:01:20,205
Go for it!

13
00:01:36,597 --> 00:01:37,890
Way to go!

14
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:44,813
Hang on, hang on.
What are y'all laughing at?

15
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:46,732
So Connie got a little lost in it.

16
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:48,358
That's a good thing.

17
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:50,027
Look, I remember one time

18
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,987
my dad took me to this jazz club,

19
00:01:52,154 --> 00:01:53,697
and that's the last place I wanted to be.

20
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:54,990
But then I see this guy,

21
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:58,744
and he's playing these chords
with fourths on it,

22
00:01:58,911 --> 00:02:00,329
and then with the minor...

23
00:02:00,412 --> 00:02:01,914
Oh, oh, whoo.

24
00:02:01,997 --> 00:02:04,708
Then he adds the inner voices,
and it's like he's...

25
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,043
It's like he's singing.

26
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,838
And I swear, the next thing I know...

27
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:13,175
...it's like he floats off the stage.

28
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:16,011
That guy was lost in the music.

29
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:19,473
He was in it, and he took
the rest of us with him.

30
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:27,523
And I wanted to learn...

31
00:02:28,899 --> 00:02:30,317
...how to talk like that.

32
00:02:31,443 --> 00:02:32,736
That's when I knew...

33
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:37,991
I was born to play.

34
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:42,579
Connie knows what I mean.
Right, Connie?

35
00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:44,081
I'm 12.

36
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:49,211
I'll be right back.
Practise your scales.

37
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,255
Sorry to interrupt, Mr Gardner.

38
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:53,632
You're doing my ears a favour.

39
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:56,134
- Hey!
- Not you, though, you're good.

40
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:57,469
He's not.

41
00:02:57,636 --> 00:02:59,137
What can I do for you, Principal Arroyo?

42
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:02,099
I wanted to deliver
the good news personally.

43
00:03:02,266 --> 00:03:04,351
No more part-time for you.

44
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:07,479
You're now our full-time band teacher.

45
00:03:07,563 --> 00:03:08,730
Job security.

46
00:03:08,814 --> 00:03:10,732
Medical insurance. Pension.

47
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:13,110
Wow. That's, uh, great.

48
00:03:13,277 --> 00:03:17,865
Welcome to the M.S. 70 family, Joe.
Permanently.

49
00:03:17,948 --> 00:03:19,867
Thanks.

50
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:36,842
After all these years,
my prayers have been answered.

51
00:03:37,009 --> 00:03:39,052
A full-time job.

52
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,512
Working man, coming through.

53
00:03:40,596 --> 00:03:41,597
Yeah, Mom, but I...

54
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,515
You're going to tell them yes, right?

55
00:03:43,682 --> 00:03:44,766
Don't worry, Mom, I got a plan.

56
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:46,185
You always got a plan.

57
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:48,187
Maybe you need to have a backup plan, too,

58
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:50,063
for when your plan falls through.

59
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:51,607
A backup plan never hurts.

60
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:54,276
Joey, we didn't struggle
giving you an education

61
00:03:54,443 --> 00:03:56,028
so you could be a middle-aged man

62
00:03:56,111 --> 00:03:57,696
washing your underwear in my shop.

63
00:03:57,863 --> 00:03:59,656
Walking around with a hole in his pants.

64
00:03:59,823 --> 00:04:01,575
- Yeah, but...
- With this job, you'll be able

65
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:03,744
to put that dead-end gigging behind you.

66
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:06,538
And Lord knows we need
more teachers in this world.

67
00:04:06,705 --> 00:04:07,706
And just think,

68
00:04:07,873 --> 00:04:11,960
playing music will finally
be your real career.

69
00:04:12,127 --> 00:04:15,088
So you're going to tell them yes, right?

70
00:04:15,506 --> 00:04:16,507
Please say yes.

71
00:04:17,049 --> 00:04:18,217
Yeah, definitely.

72
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,384
Good.

73
00:04:25,224 --> 00:04:26,225
Hello?

74
00:04:26,308 --> 00:04:27,309
How you been, Mr G?

75
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:30,020
Uh, it's Curley. Lamont.
Lamont Baker.

76
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:33,190
Hey, Curley!
Hey, good to hear your voice, man.

77
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,651
Uh... Listen.
You can call me Joe now, Curley.

78
00:04:35,734 --> 00:04:36,735
I'm not your teacher anymore.

79
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:38,070
<i>Oh, okay, Mr Gardner.</i>

80
00:04:38,237 --> 00:04:41,156
<i>Hey, look, I'm the new drummer
in the Dorothea Williams Quartet,</i>

81
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:44,243
<i>and we're kickin' off our tour
with a show at The Half Note tonight.</i>

82
00:04:44,326 --> 00:04:45,744
Dorothea Williams!
Are you kidding me?

83
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:48,330
Are you kidding me?
Congratulations, man. Wow!

84
00:04:48,497 --> 00:04:50,791
I would die a happy man

85
00:04:50,874 --> 00:04:53,377
if I could perform with Dorothea Williams.

86
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,921
<i>Oh, well,
this could be your lucky day.</i>

87
00:05:16,692 --> 00:05:18,485
- Whew, there he is.
- Hey, Curley.

88
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:20,654
Leon skipping town
really put us in a bind, man.

89
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:22,406
- Yeah. Uh, I'll bet.
- I'm glad you made it.

90
00:05:22,573 --> 00:05:25,742
My boy, Bishop, said he sat in with you
on a set last year in Brooklyn.

91
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:26,952
Said you were great.

92
00:05:27,119 --> 00:05:29,413
Well, you know,
for a coffee shop.

93
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:57,357
Hey, Dorothea.

94
00:05:58,358 --> 00:05:59,985
This is the cat I was telling you about.

95
00:06:00,152 --> 00:06:02,446
My old middle school band teacher,
Mr Gardner.

96
00:06:02,613 --> 00:06:03,947
Call me Joe, Dorothea.

97
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:05,991
Uh... Uh, I mean, Miss Williams.

98
00:06:06,158 --> 00:06:08,619
It's a pleasure. Wow.
This is amazing.

99
00:06:10,287 --> 00:06:12,247
Uh, Joe is Ray Gardner's son.

100
00:06:13,415 --> 00:06:17,252
So, we're down to
middle school band teachers now.

101
00:06:19,338 --> 00:06:23,050
Get on up here, Teach,
we ain't got all day.

102
00:06:29,306 --> 00:06:30,891
What... What are we playin'?

103
00:08:18,582 --> 00:08:19,791
Uh, sorry.

104
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:22,336
I zoned out a little back there.

105
00:08:24,171 --> 00:08:26,256
Joe Gardner, where have you been?

106
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:29,218
I've been, uh, teaching,
middle school band.

107
00:08:29,301 --> 00:08:30,552
Uh, but on the weekends, I...

108
00:08:30,636 --> 00:08:32,137
- You got a suit?
- Uh...

109
00:08:32,221 --> 00:08:34,515
Get a suit, Teach.
A good suit.

110
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:36,683
Back here tonight.
First show's at 9:00.

111
00:08:36,767 --> 00:08:37,851
Soundcheck's at 7:00.

112
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:39,603
We'll see how you do.

113
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:44,942
Yes! Whoo-hoo!

114
00:08:45,359 --> 00:08:48,111
You see that, Dad?
That's what I'm talking about!

115
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:49,279
Hey, look up, look up.

116
00:08:49,363 --> 00:08:51,615
You know what that's gonna say?
Joe Gardner!

117
00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:54,618
You're never gonna believe
what just happened.

118
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:57,037
I did it. I got the gig. Yes!

119
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,121
I... I know.

120
00:08:58,205 --> 00:08:59,915
Dorothea Williams!
Can you believe it?

121
00:09:00,082 --> 00:09:01,750
Hey, pal, you're gonna get hurt!

122
00:09:02,084 --> 00:09:04,503
Just don't tell my mom about this. Okay?

123
00:09:05,212 --> 00:09:07,256
Forget class. I'm in a different class.

124
00:09:07,339 --> 00:09:09,258
I'm in a Dorothea Williams class, buddy.

125
00:09:09,508 --> 00:09:10,509
You know what I'm saying? I'm...

126
00:09:10,592 --> 00:09:11,969
Whoa! Sorry!

127
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:31,029
What the...

128
00:09:39,204 --> 00:09:40,289
Hello?

129
00:09:42,499 --> 00:09:43,542
Hello?

130
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:56,680
What the...

131
00:10:01,435 --> 00:10:03,604
Hey! Hey, hey, hey! Hello!

132
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:06,481
Hello.

133
00:10:06,648 --> 00:10:08,442
Oh, what's your name, honey?

134
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:10,027
Uh, I'm Joe. Joe Gardner.

135
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:12,362
Look, I'm not supposed to be here.

136
00:10:12,446 --> 00:10:15,365
Ah. Must have been sudden for you.

137
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:18,577
You see, Joe, I'm 106 years old.

138
00:10:18,744 --> 00:10:21,371
Been waiting a long time for this.

139
00:10:21,663 --> 00:10:24,708
- For what?
- The Great Beyond.

140
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:28,712
The Great Beyond?

141
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:31,715
- As in, as in beyond life?
- Yeah.

142
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:33,300
That's death right there?

143
00:10:35,761 --> 00:10:37,012
Exciting, isn't it?

144
00:10:37,179 --> 00:10:38,430
No, no, no, listen.

145
00:10:38,514 --> 00:10:40,098
I have a gig tonight.
I can't die now.

146
00:10:40,182 --> 00:10:41,767
Well, I really don't think

147
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:43,227
you have a lot to say about this.

148
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:44,853
Yes. Yes, I do.

149
00:10:44,937 --> 00:10:48,065
I'm not dying the very day
I got my shot. I'm due.

150
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:49,525
Heck, I'm overdue.

151
00:10:49,608 --> 00:10:50,734
Uh-uh, uh-uh.
I'm outta here.

152
00:10:51,276 --> 00:10:54,154
I don't think you're supposed
to go that way.

153
00:10:54,321 --> 00:10:55,906
This can't happen.
I'm not dyin' today.

154
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:58,033
Not when my life just started.

155
00:11:06,917 --> 00:11:07,918
What was that?

156
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:10,504
Wait. I'm not finished.
I gotta get back.

157
00:11:10,671 --> 00:11:11,839
I don't wanna die!

158
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:14,091
I'm not done.
I'm not done. Run!

159
00:11:14,258 --> 00:11:16,093
- Why aren't you running?
- I don't know.

160
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:17,886
- What's wrong with you people?
- I don't know.

161
00:11:22,516 --> 00:11:24,560
I'm not done.

162
00:11:24,643 --> 00:11:25,644
Ahh!

163
00:11:30,816 --> 00:11:33,443
Oh, my goodness.
Oh, my goodness.

164
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:35,279
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Excuse me.

165
00:11:37,072 --> 00:11:40,075
Help! I'm not done.
I gotta get back.

166
00:11:43,245 --> 00:11:44,872
Oh, my... Oh, my goodness.

167
00:13:07,204 --> 00:13:08,205
What?

168
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:09,581
Ow!

169
00:13:13,085 --> 00:13:14,837
Now, now, everyone,

170
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,421
let's give the mentor some room.

171
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:19,258
Sorry, new souls.
37, that's enough.

172
00:13:19,424 --> 00:13:23,303
- Hey, everyone, look here.
- Quiet coyote.

173
00:13:23,512 --> 00:13:25,681
Shh. Quiet coyote.

174
00:13:26,515 --> 00:13:27,516
Who... Who are you?

175
00:13:27,683 --> 00:13:28,976
I am the coming together

176
00:13:29,059 --> 00:13:31,520
of all quantised fields of the universe.

177
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:34,857
Appearing in a form
your feeble human brain can comprehend.

178
00:13:35,023 --> 00:13:36,567
- What?
- You can call me Jerry.

179
00:13:36,733 --> 00:13:38,443
Jerry, okay.

180
00:13:38,527 --> 00:13:40,863
Uh, hey, is this heaven?

181
00:13:40,946 --> 00:13:42,739
No.

182
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:46,368
Is it H-E-double hockey sticks?

183
00:13:46,535 --> 00:13:49,997
- Hell.
- Hell, hell, hell.

184
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,124
- Shh. Quiet coyote.
- Hell.

185
00:13:52,207 --> 00:13:53,917
It's easy to get turned around.

186
00:13:54,084 --> 00:13:56,378
This isn't the Great Beyond.
It's the Great Before.

187
00:13:57,171 --> 00:13:58,630
The Great Before?

188
00:13:58,714 --> 00:14:02,134
Oh. We call it the You Seminar now.
Rebranding.

189
00:14:04,928 --> 00:14:05,929
Hell.

190
00:14:06,013 --> 00:14:07,014
No, no. You're here!

191
00:14:13,562 --> 00:14:15,105
Does this mean I'm dead?

192
00:14:15,189 --> 00:14:16,231
Not yet.

193
00:14:16,315 --> 00:14:18,192
Your body's in a holding pattern.

194
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:19,359
It's complicated.

195
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:20,944
I'll get you back to your group.

196
00:14:27,576 --> 00:14:30,579
Come on, little souls, get on up here.

197
00:14:33,707 --> 00:14:35,751
Welcome to the You Seminar.

198
00:14:37,794 --> 00:14:39,796
You are in for a treat.

199
00:14:51,934 --> 00:14:53,977
- Mm, that's weird.
- What is it?

200
00:14:54,144 --> 00:14:55,979
- The count's off.
- Excuse me?

201
00:14:56,146 --> 00:15:00,526
There's a soul missing.
The count's off.

202
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:02,945
Huh.

203
00:15:04,029 --> 00:15:07,115
Okay, first stop
is the Excitable Pavilion.

204
00:15:07,282 --> 00:15:08,951
You four. In you go.

205
00:15:17,876 --> 00:15:21,630
You five, you'll be aloof.
And you two, why not?

206
00:15:25,968 --> 00:15:27,094
Oh, wait a minute.

207
00:15:27,177 --> 00:15:28,846
This is where personalities come from?

208
00:15:29,012 --> 00:15:31,723
Of course. Do you think people
are just born with them?

209
00:15:36,854 --> 00:15:38,647
So, uh, how do they get to Earth, then?

210
00:15:38,814 --> 00:15:40,816
Well, they use the Earth portal.

211
00:15:46,363 --> 00:15:49,157
Once they get a complete personality,
of course.

212
00:15:49,324 --> 00:15:51,577
Hello? Hello?

213
00:16:02,588 --> 00:16:03,839
Goodbye.

214
00:16:09,553 --> 00:16:11,138
Whee!

215
00:16:12,806 --> 00:16:13,932
Whoo-hoo!

216
00:16:16,685 --> 00:16:18,145
Wait, wait, wait.

217
00:16:42,336 --> 00:16:44,087
You sure get lost a lot.

218
00:16:44,254 --> 00:16:46,423
All righty, mentors.

219
00:16:46,507 --> 00:16:47,966
- Just find your name here...
- Hello, Jerry...

220
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:49,051
...and join us inside.

221
00:16:49,134 --> 00:16:50,135
...got a lost mentor for you.

222
00:16:50,219 --> 00:16:51,345
Thanks, Jerry.

223
00:16:51,428 --> 00:16:53,972
Uh, look, I'm not sure
I'm supposed to be here.

224
00:16:54,139 --> 00:16:55,307
I understand.

225
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:56,808
Mentoring isn't for everyone.

226
00:16:56,892 --> 00:16:58,227
You're more than welcome to opt out.

227
00:16:58,477 --> 00:17:00,604
Actually, on second thought,

228
00:17:00,687 --> 00:17:03,857
you know, the mentoring sounds like fun.

229
00:17:04,024 --> 00:17:06,235
I'm glad to hear it.
Jerry will take it from here.

230
00:17:06,401 --> 00:17:09,029
Thanks, Jerry.
Head right on over there to Jerry.

231
00:17:09,196 --> 00:17:10,197
Thank you, Jerry.

232
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,448
Is everyone here named Jerry?

233
00:17:11,573 --> 00:17:12,574
Good luck!

234
00:17:12,658 --> 00:17:14,493
Jerry, we've got a problem.

235
00:17:14,576 --> 00:17:15,953
Oh, hello, there, Terry.

236
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:17,663
The count's off.

237
00:17:17,746 --> 00:17:19,581
I seriously doubt that.

238
00:17:19,665 --> 00:17:21,333
The count hasn't been off in centuries.

239
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:24,920
151,000 souls go into
the Great Beyond every day.

240
00:17:25,087 --> 00:17:27,923
That's 105.2 souls per minute, Jerry.

241
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:30,384
1.75 souls per second.

242
00:17:30,968 --> 00:17:32,511
And I count every single one of 'em.

243
00:17:32,594 --> 00:17:33,679
Yep. I'm aware.

244
00:17:33,762 --> 00:17:36,515
It's my job to keep track
of this stuff, Jerry.

245
00:17:36,598 --> 00:17:37,891
I'm the accountant.

246
00:17:37,975 --> 00:17:40,018
And we all think
you're doing a wonderful job,

247
00:17:40,102 --> 00:17:41,520
- don't we, everyone?
- Absolutely.

248
00:17:41,603 --> 00:17:42,604
Looks good from where this guy's standing.

249
00:17:42,688 --> 00:17:43,689
I'd say no.

250
00:17:43,856 --> 00:17:46,441
I'm always counting.
I'm counting right now.

251
00:17:46,608 --> 00:17:49,403
You blinked five times
since I started talking. Six.

252
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:51,572
Right. Since accounting is your job,

253
00:17:51,655 --> 00:17:53,657
why don't you figure out the problem?

254
00:17:53,824 --> 00:17:55,659
- Maybe I will.
- Wonderful.

255
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:03,667
Hello again, Terry.

256
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:04,960
Don't play dumb with me.

257
00:18:08,005 --> 00:18:09,214
Okay, here we go.

258
00:18:11,675 --> 00:18:12,885
"A."

259
00:18:27,482 --> 00:18:29,943
<i>Hello, there, mentors.</i>

260
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:33,113
<i>I'm Jerry, a counselor here
at the You Seminar.</i>

261
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,408
<i>Now you don't remember it,
but you've been here before.</i>

262
00:18:36,575 --> 00:18:39,411
<i>But don't worry,
forgetting the trauma of childbirth</i>

263
00:18:39,578 --> 00:18:41,872
<i>is one of the great gifts of the universe.</i>

264
00:18:42,456 --> 00:18:43,916
<i>Here at the You Seminar,</i>

265
00:18:43,999 --> 00:18:48,128
<i>all new souls are given unique
and individual personalities.</i>

266
00:18:48,212 --> 00:18:51,632
<i>I'm an agreeable sceptic
who's cautious yet flamboyant.</i>

267
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:55,719
<i>I'm an irritable wallflower
who's dangerously curious.</i>

268
00:18:55,886 --> 00:19:00,641
<i>I'm a manipulative megalomaniac
who's intensely opportunistic.</i>

269
00:19:00,724 --> 00:19:03,060
<i>Oh-ho, this one might be a handful.</i>

270
00:19:03,143 --> 00:19:04,686
<i>But that's Earth's problem.</i>

271
00:19:04,853 --> 00:19:08,106
<i>You'll notice these souls
are all missing something.</i>

272
00:19:08,273 --> 00:19:10,192
<i>What goes in this spot?</i>

273
00:19:10,359 --> 00:19:12,778
<i>Well, these souls need their "spark".</i>

274
00:19:13,153 --> 00:19:15,030
<i>And that's where you come in.</i>

275
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,366
<i>Maybe you will find their spark</i>

276
00:19:17,449 --> 00:19:19,117
<i>in the Hall of Everything,</i>

277
00:19:19,326 --> 00:19:23,539
<i>where literally anything
on Earth could inspire.</i>

278
00:19:23,664 --> 00:19:26,708
<i>Or perhaps you'll prefer the Hall of You,</i>

279
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:31,672
<i>featuring a selection of moments
from your own inspiring life.</i>

280
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:33,340
<i>And just what is this spark?</i>

281
00:19:44,893 --> 00:19:47,396
<i>I know you're all excited to get to work,</i>

282
00:19:47,479 --> 00:19:49,940
<i>so good luck finding the spark.</i>

283
00:19:50,023 --> 00:19:51,942
Find the spark.

284
00:19:52,317 --> 00:19:54,570
Wow, that was informative.

285
00:19:54,736 --> 00:19:57,990
Now, it's time for my favourite
part of the programme,

286
00:19:58,156 --> 00:20:01,451
matching you mentors with your soul mates.

287
00:20:01,618 --> 00:20:04,413
Our first mentor is Maria Martinez.

288
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:06,832
Maria, come on down.

289
00:20:06,999 --> 00:20:09,001
Maria was a rare disease specialist

290
00:20:09,084 --> 00:20:11,003
from the University of Mexico.

291
00:20:11,545 --> 00:20:14,173
<i>I'm cured. I'm cured.</i>

292
00:20:14,256 --> 00:20:16,133
She'll be matched
with one of my favourites,

293
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:21,054
soul number 108,210,121,415.

294
00:20:21,138 --> 00:20:24,016
Congratulations! Off you go.

295
00:20:24,183 --> 00:20:27,394
Our next mentor is Bjorn T. Börgensson.

296
00:20:30,439 --> 00:20:33,233
Dr Börgensson
is a world-renowned child psychologist

297
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:36,111
who was recently awarded a Nobel Prize.

298
00:20:36,445 --> 00:20:39,239
<i>I see pain, death, destruction.</i>

299
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:42,075
- <i>How about now?</i>
- <i>A pretty butterfly.</i>

300
00:20:43,285 --> 00:20:47,331
Dr Börgensson will be matched
with soul number 22.

301
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:51,210
Oh, we're gonna get into this now.
Excuse me.

302
00:20:52,836 --> 00:20:55,214
22, you come out of
this dimension right now.

303
00:20:55,297 --> 00:20:56,673
How many times
do I have to tell you?

304
00:20:56,757 --> 00:20:57,883
I don't wanna go to Earth.

305
00:20:57,966 --> 00:20:59,510
- Stop fighting this, 22.
- I don't wanna.

306
00:20:59,593 --> 00:21:00,636
You will go to Earth

307
00:21:00,719 --> 00:21:01,720
- and have a life.
- Make me!

308
00:21:02,179 --> 00:21:04,723
22 has been at the You Seminar
for quite some time

309
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:07,351
and has had such
notable mentors as Gandhi,

310
00:21:07,434 --> 00:21:09,478
Abraham Lincoln, and Mother Teresa.

311
00:21:09,561 --> 00:21:11,230
I made her cry.

312
00:21:11,313 --> 00:21:12,481
Ignore that.

313
00:21:12,564 --> 00:21:13,565
Put me down.

314
00:21:13,649 --> 00:21:15,484
We're truly glad to have you here,
Dr Börgensson.

315
00:21:18,195 --> 00:21:21,156
It is an honour having you
prepare 22 for Earth.

316
00:21:21,657 --> 00:21:23,450
I'm gonna make you wish you never died.

317
00:21:23,617 --> 00:21:25,744
Most people wish that, 22.

318
00:21:25,827 --> 00:21:28,705
Off you go. Bye!

319
00:21:33,126 --> 00:21:35,003
Where are we?

320
00:21:35,587 --> 00:21:36,672
That's great progress.

321
00:21:36,755 --> 00:21:39,383
You should be very proud.
Step by step.

322
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:41,718
In celebration of
Dr Börgensson's body of work,

323
00:21:41,802 --> 00:21:43,720
we are pleased to present him
this honorary...

324
00:21:43,804 --> 00:21:45,389
These past few weeks,
I have seen such growth.

325
00:21:45,472 --> 00:21:46,849
So many people I'd like to thank,
of course.

326
00:21:46,932 --> 00:21:48,934
Okay, look,
I'm sure your life was amazing

327
00:21:49,017 --> 00:21:50,394
and you did amazing things,

328
00:21:50,477 --> 00:21:51,520
but here's what we're gonna do.

329
00:21:51,603 --> 00:21:53,146
We're gonna stand here
in silence for a little bit,

330
00:21:53,313 --> 00:21:54,857
then we go back out, you say you tried,

331
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:57,484
I go back to not living my non-life
and you go to the Great Beyond.

332
00:21:57,568 --> 00:21:59,027
- No, look.
- Talk all you want, Bjorn.

333
00:21:59,194 --> 00:22:00,529
It's not gonna work, anyway.

334
00:22:00,696 --> 00:22:02,948
I've had thousands of mentors
who failed and now hate me.

335
00:22:03,115 --> 00:22:04,116
Mother Teresa...

336
00:22:04,283 --> 00:22:07,202
I have compassion for every soul.

337
00:22:07,369 --> 00:22:08,871
Except you. I don't like you.

338
00:22:09,037 --> 00:22:10,038
Copernicus...

339
00:22:10,122 --> 00:22:12,541
The world doesn't revolve around you, 22.

340
00:22:12,708 --> 00:22:13,709
Muhammad Ali...

341
00:22:13,792 --> 00:22:16,211
You are the greatest pain in the butt.

342
00:22:16,378 --> 00:22:17,421
Marie Antoinette...

343
00:22:17,504 --> 00:22:19,464
Nobody can help you! Nobody!

344
00:22:19,631 --> 00:22:20,716
Thanks, but no thanks, Doc.

345
00:22:20,883 --> 00:22:22,634
I already know everything about Earth,

346
00:22:22,718 --> 00:22:23,802
and it's not worth the trouble.

347
00:22:23,969 --> 00:22:25,929
Come on, don't you want
to fill out your pass?

348
00:22:26,013 --> 00:22:28,056
You know, I'm comfortable up here.

349
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:29,224
I have my routine.

350
00:22:29,308 --> 00:22:31,185
I float in mist, I do my Sudoku puzzles,

351
00:22:31,268 --> 00:22:32,436
and then, like, once a week,

352
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:34,229
they make me come
to one of these You Seminars.

353
00:22:34,396 --> 00:22:35,731
It's not great, but I know what to expect.

354
00:22:35,898 --> 00:22:38,233
Look, kid, I'm not...
Can I just be honest with you?

355
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,485
I'm not Bjorn Borgenstein

356
00:22:40,569 --> 00:22:42,112
or whatever his name is.
I'm not even a mentor.

357
00:22:42,279 --> 00:22:43,697
Not a mentor?

358
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:46,950
Ah...

359
00:22:47,034 --> 00:22:48,744
Reverse psychology.

360
00:22:48,827 --> 00:22:51,496
You really are a good shrink, Doctor.

361
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:52,915
Carl Jung already tried that.

362
00:22:53,081 --> 00:22:55,751
Stop talking!
My unconscious mind hates you!

363
00:22:55,834 --> 00:22:57,503
Is there any way

364
00:22:57,586 --> 00:22:59,171
to show a different life in this place?

365
00:23:10,098 --> 00:23:14,102
Wait. You're really not Bjorn Börgensson?

366
00:23:15,354 --> 00:23:16,688
It's my life.

367
00:23:16,772 --> 00:23:19,024
Um, excuse me, what's going on here?

368
00:23:19,191 --> 00:23:21,443
Binaca breath spray?
Cheap cologne?

369
00:23:23,111 --> 00:23:25,155
Man, who curated this exhibit?

370
00:23:25,239 --> 00:23:26,657
You did.

371
00:23:27,491 --> 00:23:29,159
<i>♪ I go to Harlem, it's no problems</i>

372
00:23:29,243 --> 00:23:31,745
Oh, my goodness.
It's Cedric's rap group. No!

373
00:23:31,912 --> 00:23:33,956
<i>♪ Now everybody bow down
To the Kings of Queens ♪</i>

374
00:23:34,039 --> 00:23:36,708
No, don't look at that stuff.
Let's look over here.

375
00:23:37,584 --> 00:23:39,294
Dad, I don't wanna go.

376
00:23:39,378 --> 00:23:40,587
I don't like jazz.

377
00:23:40,671 --> 00:23:42,548
Black improvisational music.

378
00:23:42,714 --> 00:23:44,967
It's one of our great contributions
to American culture.

379
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:46,969
At least give it a chance, Joey.

380
00:23:50,389 --> 00:23:51,598
This is where it all started.

381
00:23:51,765 --> 00:23:54,768
This is the moment where
I fell in love with jazz.

382
00:23:56,353 --> 00:23:57,396
Listen to that.

383
00:23:57,479 --> 00:23:59,898
See, the tune is just an excuse
to bring out the you.

384
00:24:00,065 --> 00:24:03,068
And that's why I became a jazz musician.

385
00:24:04,987 --> 00:24:06,572
It's not what we're looking for.

386
00:24:06,738 --> 00:24:09,449
Wait a minute, that's not how
I remember it going down.

387
00:24:09,616 --> 00:24:11,702
Come back when you have something.

388
00:24:11,952 --> 00:24:14,162
- Sorry, Joe.
- Sorry, Joe.

389
00:24:14,329 --> 00:24:15,706
We're looking
for something different.

390
00:24:15,873 --> 00:24:17,708
Two, three, four.

391
00:24:37,853 --> 00:24:40,355
My life was meaningless.

392
00:24:49,114 --> 00:24:50,574
No, no, no.

393
00:24:50,741 --> 00:24:51,909
No, I will not accept this.

394
00:24:52,075 --> 00:24:55,204
Kid, give me that badge.
I'm goin' back to my body.

395
00:24:55,746 --> 00:24:57,748
Oh, yeah, sure. Here.

396
00:25:06,882 --> 00:25:09,551
Unless it becomes an Earth Pass,
I'm stuck with it.

397
00:25:11,678 --> 00:25:14,389
Well, what if I help you
turn it into an Earth Pass?

398
00:25:14,556 --> 00:25:15,557
Will you give it to me then?

399
00:25:17,476 --> 00:25:18,560
Wait...

400
00:25:18,727 --> 00:25:22,564
I've never thought of that.
I'd get to skip life.

401
00:25:22,731 --> 00:25:24,191
So, yes!

402
00:25:24,775 --> 00:25:26,527
But we gotta get
this thing to change first,

403
00:25:26,693 --> 00:25:28,570
and I've never been able
to get it to change.

404
00:25:28,862 --> 00:25:30,781
Come on.
I know all about sparks.

405
00:25:30,948 --> 00:25:32,741
Because mine is piano.

406
00:25:43,836 --> 00:25:46,922
- Really? Nothin' at all?
- Eh.

407
00:25:47,172 --> 00:25:51,260
Oh, no, not jazz, just music.
I don't like music sounds.

408
00:25:51,635 --> 00:25:53,220
It feels like a little too much.

409
00:25:55,138 --> 00:25:56,640
Well, I'm not going out like this.

410
00:25:56,807 --> 00:25:59,476
Where's that, uh, Hall of Everything?

411
00:26:02,229 --> 00:26:03,730
I'll be right back.

412
00:26:03,897 --> 00:26:05,023
Don't get ahead of yourself, pal.

413
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:07,359
By the way, why do you sound
like a middle-aged white lady?

414
00:26:07,442 --> 00:26:08,443
I don't.

415
00:26:08,527 --> 00:26:09,653
- This is all an illusion.
- Huh?

416
00:26:09,736 --> 00:26:11,113
This whole place is a hypothetical.

417
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:13,323
I could sound
like this if I wanted to.

418
00:26:13,532 --> 00:26:14,950
Or sound like this instead.

419
00:26:15,033 --> 00:26:16,285
I could even sound like you.

420
00:26:16,368 --> 00:26:17,578
Life is so unfair.

421
00:26:17,661 --> 00:26:20,998
I don't wanna die.
Somebody call the wambulance. Wah!

422
00:26:21,748 --> 00:26:23,917
I just use this voice
because it annoys people.

423
00:26:24,001 --> 00:26:25,169
It's very effective.

424
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:31,592
Don't worry, they're fine.

425
00:26:33,218 --> 00:26:34,720
You can't crush a soul here.

426
00:26:34,803 --> 00:26:36,263
That's what life on Earth is for.

427
00:26:36,555 --> 00:26:37,848
Very witty.

428
00:26:40,601 --> 00:26:42,019
Okay. Here we are.

429
00:26:42,186 --> 00:26:44,354
This is the Hall of Everything.

430
00:26:44,688 --> 00:26:45,898
Whoa!

431
00:26:55,407 --> 00:26:56,408
Yes!

432
00:27:02,414 --> 00:27:03,749
- Whoa.
- Congratulations!

433
00:27:03,832 --> 00:27:04,833
So, where do you want to start?

434
00:27:04,917 --> 00:27:05,959
Come on.

435
00:27:07,336 --> 00:27:10,172
Croissants, cakes.
Baking could be your spark.

436
00:27:10,339 --> 00:27:12,591
Yeah! But, um, I don't get it.

437
00:27:12,758 --> 00:27:14,635
- Just smell it.
- Can't, and neither can you.

438
00:27:14,801 --> 00:27:15,844
What?

439
00:27:15,928 --> 00:27:17,846
You're right. I can't smell.

440
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:19,973
We can't...
We can't taste, either?

441
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:21,850
All that stuff is in your body.

442
00:27:22,726 --> 00:27:26,188
- No smell, no taste.
- Or touch. See?

443
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:32,152
Okay, I get it. Moving on.

444
00:27:32,861 --> 00:27:33,946
Isn't this exciting?

445
00:27:34,112 --> 00:27:35,864
The fire is so pretty.

446
00:27:36,031 --> 00:27:37,449
I kinda wanna let it spread.

447
00:27:37,533 --> 00:27:38,534
Nope.

448
00:27:39,451 --> 00:27:40,619
Hands are hard.

449
00:27:40,786 --> 00:27:42,246
How about a librarian?
They're cool.

450
00:27:42,412 --> 00:27:43,622
Yes, amazing.

451
00:27:43,705 --> 00:27:45,165
Who wouldn't like working
at a thankless job

452
00:27:45,249 --> 00:27:47,584
you're always in danger of
losing due to budget cuts?

453
00:27:47,751 --> 00:27:49,545
Though I do like the idea
of randomly shushing people.

454
00:27:49,711 --> 00:27:50,838
- Look, obviously this...
- Shh!

455
00:27:50,921 --> 00:27:52,089
Oh, yeah, that's good.

456
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:53,841
Meh.

457
00:27:54,842 --> 00:27:55,843
Meh.

458
00:27:56,552 --> 00:27:57,553
Meh.

459
00:28:00,264 --> 00:28:02,349
Meh.

460
00:28:04,476 --> 00:28:06,812
Well, I think that's everything.

461
00:28:06,979 --> 00:28:08,856
- Sorry.
- You told me you'd try.

462
00:28:09,022 --> 00:28:11,108
I did. I'm telling the truth.

463
00:28:11,191 --> 00:28:12,985
If there's one thing I'm not, it's a liar.

464
00:28:13,068 --> 00:28:14,486
Unlike Abraham Lincoln.

465
00:28:14,653 --> 00:28:16,655
You're really okay being on a penny?

466
00:28:16,822 --> 00:28:18,532
Well, of course. It's an honour.

467
00:28:18,615 --> 00:28:20,993
Okay, but they put
Andrew Jackson on the 20.

468
00:28:21,076 --> 00:28:22,160
Jackson!

469
00:28:22,244 --> 00:28:24,204
What can I say, Joe?
Earth is boring.

470
00:28:24,288 --> 00:28:25,372
Well, what else can we do, then?

471
00:28:25,455 --> 00:28:26,540
Because we're running out of time.

472
00:28:26,623 --> 00:28:28,417
Yeah, you know,
time's not really a thing here.

473
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:30,085
Time's up!

474
00:28:30,169 --> 00:28:32,296
Nice try, Bjorn, but no need to feel bad.

475
00:28:32,379 --> 00:28:33,964
22 here can be a bit of a challenge.

476
00:28:34,047 --> 00:28:35,674
Even though I can't feel it,
please don't touch me.

477
00:28:35,841 --> 00:28:37,509
So, let's get you to the Great Beyond.

478
00:28:39,887 --> 00:28:43,223
Um, wait.
We forgot to try breakdancer.

479
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:45,184
Yeah! I think that's gonna be my thing.

480
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:47,394
Poppin' and lockin'. Windmills.

481
00:28:47,561 --> 00:28:49,313
Settling my disputes with dance.

482
00:28:49,396 --> 00:28:51,732
Can we have one more minute
to go back and try breakdancer?

483
00:28:51,815 --> 00:28:52,983
Please, Jerry?

484
00:28:53,066 --> 00:28:54,193
You look really good today, Jerry.

485
00:28:54,359 --> 00:28:57,571
Oh, okay.
I've never seen 22 this enthused.

486
00:28:58,071 --> 00:28:59,948
Good for you, Dr Börgensson.

487
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:03,160
Run.

488
00:29:05,287 --> 00:29:06,455
In here.

489
00:29:15,923 --> 00:29:16,924
Here it is.

490
00:29:17,674 --> 00:29:18,926
Where does it lead?

491
00:29:19,009 --> 00:29:20,135
Hey, you ask too many questions.

492
00:29:20,219 --> 00:29:21,428
How about you zip it for a minute, m'kay?

493
00:29:21,512 --> 00:29:23,555
- And we're going there why?
- 'Cause I know a guy there.

494
00:29:23,722 --> 00:29:25,098
A guy who can help.
A guy like you.

495
00:29:25,182 --> 00:29:27,434
Like me? As in, alive?

496
00:29:27,893 --> 00:29:30,604
Wait, are you actually helping me?

497
00:29:30,771 --> 00:29:32,689
Joe, I have been here
for who knows how long,

498
00:29:32,898 --> 00:29:35,275
and I've never seen anything
that's made me want to live.

499
00:29:35,442 --> 00:29:39,238
And then, you come along.
Your life is sad and pathetic.

500
00:29:39,404 --> 00:29:41,907
And you're working so hard
to get back to it.

501
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:44,284
Why? I mean, this I gotta see.

502
00:29:44,451 --> 00:29:45,827
Okay, let's go.

503
00:29:54,670 --> 00:29:56,046
What is this place?

504
00:29:56,129 --> 00:29:58,257
You know how when you humans
are really into something

505
00:29:58,423 --> 00:30:00,592
and it feels like you're in another place?

506
00:30:00,676 --> 00:30:02,803
Feels like you're in the zone, right?

507
00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:04,680
- Yeah.
- Well, this is the zone.

508
00:30:04,847 --> 00:30:06,932
It's the space between
the physical and spiritual.

509
00:30:07,099 --> 00:30:10,394
Wait a minute. I was here.
Today, doing my audition.

510
00:30:10,561 --> 00:30:13,522
This must be where musicians come
when they get into a flow.

511
00:30:13,689 --> 00:30:15,941
Not just musicians. Watch this.

512
00:30:16,108 --> 00:30:19,611
O, Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou...

513
00:30:20,028 --> 00:30:21,029
Line!

514
00:30:23,824 --> 00:30:24,825
Oops.

515
00:30:24,908 --> 00:30:25,909
Check this out.

516
00:30:25,993 --> 00:30:28,328
I have been messing
with this team for decades.

517
00:30:29,496 --> 00:30:31,957
<i>And the Knicks
lose another one.</i>

518
00:30:32,124 --> 00:30:34,501
All right. All right.
Where's this guy you know?

519
00:30:34,585 --> 00:30:35,586
I gotta get back to my gig.

520
00:30:35,669 --> 00:30:37,713
- Okay. I mean, he's usually down here.
- What the...

521
00:30:38,088 --> 00:30:39,089
Make a trade.

522
00:30:39,173 --> 00:30:41,425
Make a trade. Make a trade.

523
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:42,593
- What is that?
- Shh!

524
00:30:43,594 --> 00:30:45,137
Make a trade. Make a trade.

525
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:46,221
Run!

526
00:30:46,305 --> 00:30:47,890
Make a trade,
make a trade, make a trade!

527
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:09,328
Oh! Ahoy there, fellow astral travellers.

528
00:31:09,411 --> 00:31:11,163
Good to see you again, 22.

529
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:13,248
Moonwind, how are ya?

530
00:31:13,415 --> 00:31:15,000
On the brink of madness,
thanks for asking.

531
00:31:15,167 --> 00:31:16,251
Hey, got a request for you.

532
00:31:16,335 --> 00:31:18,754
Uh, yeah.
I'm trying to get back to my body.

533
00:31:18,837 --> 00:31:19,963
Can you help me?

534
00:31:20,047 --> 00:31:21,548
That's what we do.

535
00:31:21,632 --> 00:31:23,467
We are the mystics without borders.

536
00:31:23,634 --> 00:31:26,512
Devoted to helping
the lost souls of Earth find their way.

537
00:31:26,678 --> 00:31:28,430
I'm Moonwind Stardancer at your service.

538
00:31:28,597 --> 00:31:30,766
That's Windstar Dreamermoon,
Dancerstar Windmoon,

539
00:31:30,933 --> 00:31:32,267
and that's Dreamerwind Dreamerdreamer.

540
00:31:32,351 --> 00:31:33,560
These weirdos are going
to help me get back?

541
00:31:33,644 --> 00:31:34,645
Just wait.

542
00:31:35,145 --> 00:31:37,397
Let's get this lost soul back home.

543
00:31:38,232 --> 00:31:40,025
Make a trade.

544
00:31:40,108 --> 00:31:42,027
Make a trade. Make a trade.

545
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:43,111
Poor fellow.

546
00:31:43,529 --> 00:31:46,490
Some people just can't let go
of their own anxieties and obsessions,

547
00:31:46,573 --> 00:31:48,700
leaving them lost
and disconnected from life.

548
00:31:48,784 --> 00:31:50,536
And this is the result.

549
00:31:50,702 --> 00:31:52,496
Make a trade. Make a trade.

550
00:31:52,579 --> 00:31:54,331
Make a trade. Make a trade.

551
00:31:54,414 --> 00:31:56,041
Make a trade?

552
00:31:56,375 --> 00:31:58,043
Looks like another hedge fund manager.

553
00:31:58,210 --> 00:32:01,922
Now, to reconnect to your earthly body.

554
00:32:05,843 --> 00:32:08,136
Whoa. That's me.

555
00:32:08,512 --> 00:32:09,555
Thank you.

556
00:32:14,309 --> 00:32:16,395
What am I doing with my life?

557
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:21,692
I'm alive! I'm alive! Free yourselves!

558
00:32:21,775 --> 00:32:23,694
It's beautiful!

559
00:32:23,986 --> 00:32:26,196
Whoa. He got back just like that?

560
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:28,866
So this is all I had to do
to get back to my body?

561
00:32:31,076 --> 00:32:33,328
Egads, man!

562
00:32:33,495 --> 00:32:35,497
Joe, are you dead?

563
00:32:35,664 --> 00:32:37,666
No, no. Well, not yet.

564
00:32:38,041 --> 00:32:39,042
Can you help me get back?

565
00:32:39,209 --> 00:32:42,838
We've never connected an untethered soul
back to its body before.

566
00:32:42,921 --> 00:32:46,508
But perhaps if we travel to a thin spot...

567
00:32:46,675 --> 00:32:47,759
Yes! All aboard!

568
00:32:48,093 --> 00:32:49,887
Anchors away!

569
00:32:59,229 --> 00:33:01,940
So if your souls are here,
where are your bodies?

570
00:33:02,107 --> 00:33:03,609
Well, on Earth, of course.

571
00:33:03,775 --> 00:33:05,527
My body is in a trance in Palawan.

572
00:33:05,611 --> 00:33:07,946
I'm playing the Saraswati <i>veena</i> in Tibet.

573
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:10,490
I'm a shamanic healer
meditating in Berkeley, California.

574
00:33:10,574 --> 00:33:13,368
Mm-hmm. And let me guess,
you're drumming, chanting, and meditating?

575
00:33:13,452 --> 00:33:14,995
Yes. Something like that.

576
00:33:18,749 --> 00:33:21,084
I'm in New York City,
on the corner of 14th and 7th.

577
00:33:21,251 --> 00:33:23,003
Oh, yeah, that's right up
from Tony Tony Tonios.

578
00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:24,505
Yes, precisely.

579
00:33:24,671 --> 00:33:26,882
And what about you?
I thought you hated Earth.

580
00:33:27,049 --> 00:33:28,258
Yeah, I'm not stuck with a body.

581
00:33:28,342 --> 00:33:29,927
So I can go wherever I want.

582
00:33:30,093 --> 00:33:31,553
I'm a nobody, get it?

583
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:35,265
We mystics meet in this glorious landscape
every Tuesday.

584
00:33:41,104 --> 00:33:43,398
So many of them. Sad.

585
00:33:43,565 --> 00:33:46,068
You know,
lost souls are not that different

586
00:33:46,151 --> 00:33:47,402
from those in the zone.

587
00:33:47,569 --> 00:33:49,655
- What?
- The zone is enjoyable,

588
00:33:49,821 --> 00:33:53,909
but when that joy becomes an obsession,
one becomes disconnected from life.

589
00:33:53,992 --> 00:33:54,993
Gotta find it.

590
00:33:55,077 --> 00:33:56,995
Gotta find it. Gotta find it.

591
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,541
For a time, I was a lost soul myself.

592
00:34:00,707 --> 00:34:02,543
- Really?
- Tetris.

593
00:34:08,006 --> 00:34:09,132
There you are.

594
00:34:09,216 --> 00:34:11,260
We'll have you back in no time.

595
00:34:15,389 --> 00:34:17,307
Now, since you don't have
a connection to your body,

596
00:34:17,391 --> 00:34:21,562
you will have to tune back
into your physical surroundings.

597
00:34:24,565 --> 00:34:25,649
Close your eyes.

598
00:34:25,732 --> 00:34:28,735
Breathe into your crown chakra.

599
00:34:31,947 --> 00:34:33,657
Do we really need all this?

600
00:34:33,824 --> 00:34:35,659
Yes!

601
00:34:36,827 --> 00:34:38,996
Do you have a piano on board?
I could focus with that.

602
00:34:39,079 --> 00:34:41,415
No pianos, Joe. You must focus.

603
00:34:41,707 --> 00:34:43,584
Imagine silence.

604
00:34:43,667 --> 00:34:45,127
Shh.

605
00:34:46,044 --> 00:34:50,215
Now, concentrate on where your body is.

606
00:34:50,382 --> 00:34:52,342
Listen for cues.

607
00:35:04,313 --> 00:35:06,273
That's it. You're doing it.

608
00:35:09,193 --> 00:35:10,986
No peeking.
Maintain your meditative state

609
00:35:11,069 --> 00:35:12,112
or you'll break the connection.

610
00:35:12,654 --> 00:35:17,618
Now, see if you can smell
and feel where your body is.

611
00:35:18,243 --> 00:35:21,580
I hear a heart monitor.

612
00:35:23,665 --> 00:35:26,877
I can smell hand sanitiser.

613
00:35:27,044 --> 00:35:29,588
<i>Yes. Yes! Good.</i>

614
00:35:29,671 --> 00:35:31,882
<i>I think I can feel my feet.</i>

615
00:35:32,508 --> 00:35:34,259
Hmm. I feel fur.

616
00:35:34,801 --> 00:35:36,345
Did you find a next of kin?

617
00:35:36,428 --> 00:35:38,639
I feel fur.

618
00:35:38,722 --> 00:35:39,765
Did you hear that?

619
00:35:39,848 --> 00:35:41,934
Oh, the therapy cat is working.

620
00:35:42,434 --> 00:35:44,728
Am I close?
When can I jump in?

621
00:35:44,895 --> 00:35:46,271
Look! There I am.

622
00:35:46,813 --> 00:35:47,940
There I am.

623
00:35:48,023 --> 00:35:50,025
His heart rate is increasing.

624
00:35:50,108 --> 00:35:51,109
I'll get the doctor.

625
00:35:51,193 --> 00:35:52,402
Mr Mittens, you stay right there.

626
00:35:52,486 --> 00:35:53,737
- What are we waiting for?
- No, Joe, don't rush this.

627
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:55,697
- It's not the right time.
- No, it's my time.

628
00:35:55,781 --> 00:35:56,949
Wait, not me!

629
00:36:13,882 --> 00:36:17,135
I did it.
I did it! I'm back.

630
00:36:18,846 --> 00:36:19,888
What the...

631
00:36:21,515 --> 00:36:22,516
No.

632
00:36:23,809 --> 00:36:26,103
No. No. No.

633
00:36:26,270 --> 00:36:27,604
I'm in the cat?

634
00:36:27,771 --> 00:36:29,481
Wait a minute.
If I'm in here, then who...

635
00:36:29,565 --> 00:36:31,608
- What?
- You're in my body!

636
00:36:31,692 --> 00:36:33,819
- You're in the cat?
- Wait, wait, that's my body.

637
00:36:33,902 --> 00:36:36,655
- I'm in a body! No!
- Why are you in my body?

638
00:36:36,864 --> 00:36:38,490
I don't wanna be a cat.
I hate cats!

639
00:36:38,657 --> 00:36:39,741
Oh, it's disgusting.

640
00:36:39,825 --> 00:36:41,493
That Moonwind guy, he messed this up.

641
00:36:42,452 --> 00:36:44,705
Doc, you gotta help me.
That's my body, but I'm trapped...

642
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,751
Oh, no, they can't understand me.

643
00:36:49,835 --> 00:36:51,587
They think you're me.
You gotta try.

644
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:54,089
Miss Doctor, we have a problem.

645
00:36:54,173 --> 00:36:56,633
I'm an unborn soul
and I wanna stay at the You Seminar.

646
00:36:56,717 --> 00:36:58,552
Yes, well, that drug doesn't
seem to be working at all.

647
00:36:58,635 --> 00:36:59,803
No, no, no, you don't understand.

648
00:36:59,887 --> 00:37:00,888
- I'm not Mr Gardner.
- Shh!

649
00:37:00,971 --> 00:37:02,097
They're gonna think you're nuts.

650
00:37:02,181 --> 00:37:03,265
I mean, that I'm nuts.

651
00:37:03,348 --> 00:37:04,433
Oh, how did this happen?

652
00:37:04,516 --> 00:37:06,810
I fell into your body because
it doesn't have a soul.

653
00:37:06,894 --> 00:37:08,520
Then why am I in a cat?

654
00:37:08,604 --> 00:37:10,063
I don't know!

655
00:37:12,482 --> 00:37:14,776
Is there anyone we can call, Mr Gardner?

656
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:16,403
A next of kin or friend?

657
00:37:16,570 --> 00:37:18,488
- Tell her no.
- Uh, no.

658
00:37:18,655 --> 00:37:19,823
Can you tell me what day it is?

659
00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:21,241
It's the worst day of my life.

660
00:37:21,325 --> 00:37:22,784
I don't wanna be here. I hate Earth.

661
00:37:22,951 --> 00:37:24,703
Tell you what.
We're going to keep you here

662
00:37:24,786 --> 00:37:26,496
for observation. Just for a bit.

663
00:37:26,663 --> 00:37:28,749
Perhaps our therapy cat can go
to his next appointment.

664
00:37:28,832 --> 00:37:30,083
Okay. Okay.

665
00:37:30,167 --> 00:37:32,169
- You gotta talk to her.
- Okay.

666
00:37:32,252 --> 00:37:34,671
Miss Doctor,
this body's soul is in this cat.

667
00:37:34,755 --> 00:37:35,756
Stop talking.

668
00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:37,132
So naturally, he wants to stay close.

669
00:37:37,299 --> 00:37:39,426
Uh, keep the cat.
Just get some rest.

670
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:40,677
A lot of it. Okay?

671
00:37:40,761 --> 00:37:42,888
I'll come get Mr Mittens in ten minutes.

672
00:37:43,388 --> 00:37:44,681
Ten minutes?
We gotta get outta here.

673
00:37:44,765 --> 00:37:47,643
No way! I am not moving!

674
00:37:47,809 --> 00:37:51,063
I can't believe I'm in a body
on this hellish planet.

675
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:53,106
I have bendy meat sticks.

676
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:56,026
I can feel myself feeling myself.

677
00:37:56,109 --> 00:37:58,237
Hey! Focus! Listen to me.

678
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,988
We gotta get out of here
before they take me away.

679
00:38:00,155 --> 00:38:02,115
Take you away?
You're gonna leave me?

680
00:38:02,282 --> 00:38:03,867
No way! That's my body you're in.

681
00:38:03,951 --> 00:38:05,244
Okay, do you think you can walk?

682
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:06,537
I don't know!

683
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:09,122
I failed Body Test Drive, like, 436 times.

684
00:38:09,289 --> 00:38:10,791
But will you try?

685
00:38:13,627 --> 00:38:16,588
Okay. Gotta find Moonwind,
he can fix this.

686
00:38:17,881 --> 00:38:19,508
I'm a cat. I can make this.

687
00:38:25,472 --> 00:38:27,474
Okay, come on, you're doing great.

688
00:38:27,558 --> 00:38:29,852
Keep going. Keep going.

689
00:38:29,935 --> 00:38:31,770
I'm just gonna rest here for a minute.

690
00:38:31,854 --> 00:38:34,606
No, no, no, no.
They'll be back any minute. Come on.

691
00:38:34,773 --> 00:38:36,441
Okay!

692
00:38:48,161 --> 00:38:49,663
In here!

693
00:38:55,794 --> 00:38:57,337
Whoa.

694
00:38:58,672 --> 00:38:59,882
Okay, good.

695
00:39:01,049 --> 00:39:03,260
Now push the down button.

696
00:39:04,261 --> 00:39:06,513
Move your... Nope. Careful.

697
00:39:06,597 --> 00:39:07,764
Those fingers are my livelihood.

698
00:39:11,018 --> 00:39:12,019
Ugh.

699
00:39:12,102 --> 00:39:13,896
Now get in.

700
00:39:16,273 --> 00:39:17,524
Phew!

701
00:39:19,735 --> 00:39:20,736
Hmm.

702
00:39:23,113 --> 00:39:24,948
Hmm.

703
00:39:25,032 --> 00:39:26,491
Okay, what did Moonwind say?

704
00:39:26,575 --> 00:39:28,535
He said on the corner of 14th and 7th.

705
00:39:28,619 --> 00:39:30,662
Yeah, that's Chelsea.
Near Jackson Square Park.

706
00:39:30,746 --> 00:39:32,414
Exactly. Wait.
How do you know all that?

707
00:39:32,497 --> 00:39:33,916
It's all in this stupid brain of yours.

708
00:39:33,999 --> 00:39:35,501
Hey, hey, hey, stay outta there.

709
00:39:35,584 --> 00:39:37,336
Oh, relax. There's not much here.

710
00:39:37,503 --> 00:39:38,962
Jazz, jazz, more jazz.

711
00:39:39,046 --> 00:39:40,672
Oh, and someone named Lisa.
Who's that?

712
00:39:40,756 --> 00:39:41,798
Uh, never mind.

713
00:39:52,768 --> 00:39:54,186
I, um...

714
00:39:54,269 --> 00:39:55,479
It's all happening too fast, you know.

715
00:39:55,562 --> 00:39:56,813
Let's just take a minute and, um...

716
00:39:56,897 --> 00:39:59,024
Come on, let's go.
They could be here any second.

717
00:40:09,993 --> 00:40:12,287
Don't worry, it's okay.
Just keep walking.

718
00:40:17,584 --> 00:40:18,585
Aah!

719
00:40:18,669 --> 00:40:19,711
No, don't stop.
What are you doing?

720
00:40:19,795 --> 00:40:20,796
This is New York City.

721
00:40:20,879 --> 00:40:23,382
You don't stop in the middle
of the street. Go, go, go.

722
00:40:28,762 --> 00:40:30,889
Oh, no. 22. 22!

723
00:40:32,349 --> 00:40:35,644
22. Oh, no.
Oh, no. 22. 22.

724
00:40:35,811 --> 00:40:37,521
22! 22!

725
00:40:43,318 --> 00:40:45,779
22, I didn't know I had claws, okay?

726
00:40:45,946 --> 00:40:47,948
Look, I'm sorry.
But come on, let's go.

727
00:40:48,031 --> 00:40:49,032
No way.

728
00:40:49,116 --> 00:40:51,994
I am staying right here
until your stupid body dies.

729
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:55,080
Which will happen any minute now
because your stomach is earthquaking.

730
00:41:09,011 --> 00:41:10,679
Yeah, this place is worse than I thought.

731
00:41:10,762 --> 00:41:13,098
It's loud, and bright, and...

732
00:41:13,182 --> 00:41:15,267
Hmm.
What is that in my nose?

733
00:41:15,434 --> 00:41:17,019
That's smell.

734
00:41:17,102 --> 00:41:20,189
And if you think that's good,
just imagine what it tastes like.

735
00:41:20,606 --> 00:41:22,608
Hmm.

736
00:41:22,691 --> 00:41:23,734
Go on.

737
00:41:31,867 --> 00:41:34,536
It's so good!

738
00:41:35,579 --> 00:41:36,830
It's, uh...

739
00:41:36,914 --> 00:41:38,624
It's not horrible.

740
00:41:38,790 --> 00:41:40,876
Good. You can eat on the way.
Let's go.

741
00:41:42,085 --> 00:41:45,464
Or you just take a few minutes. Sure.

742
00:41:48,175 --> 00:41:50,469
Hmm. Strange,
I don't feel so angry anymore.

743
00:41:50,636 --> 00:41:53,222
That's great.
Ready to find Moonwind?

744
00:41:54,097 --> 00:41:55,098
Maybe.

745
00:41:55,265 --> 00:41:57,768
I'm telling you, Joe,
it's pronounced yee-row.

746
00:41:57,851 --> 00:42:00,312
Yeah, but in New York,
we call them gyros. It's Greek.

747
00:42:00,395 --> 00:42:01,980
No, I got in a fight
with Archimedes about this.

748
00:42:02,064 --> 00:42:03,065
He said it's...

749
00:42:03,148 --> 00:42:04,608
- Yee-row.
- Yo-yo.

750
00:42:04,691 --> 00:42:05,901
- Yee-row.
- YOLO.

751
00:42:05,984 --> 00:42:06,985
- Yee-row.
- Sergio?

752
00:42:07,069 --> 00:42:08,070
Yee-row!

753
00:42:08,695 --> 00:42:09,863
I miss that guy.

754
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:11,657
This is 14th and 7th.

755
00:42:13,450 --> 00:42:14,743
That's gotta be him.

756
00:42:17,704 --> 00:42:19,414
Moonwind, you gotta help me.

757
00:42:22,292 --> 00:42:24,086
Joe! You made it into your body.

758
00:42:24,253 --> 00:42:25,337
No, he didn't.

759
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:27,130
That is my body.

760
00:42:27,297 --> 00:42:28,882
You're in a cat?

761
00:42:29,049 --> 00:42:30,217
That's marvellous!

762
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:31,510
Hey, Moonwimp!

763
00:42:31,593 --> 00:42:33,679
That sign won't spin by itself, hear me?

764
00:42:33,846 --> 00:42:36,932
But, Marge, look!
I put this man's soul in a cat.

765
00:42:37,099 --> 00:42:38,433
Who cares? And you!

766
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:41,478
We only have room for
one weirdo here, so, scram!

767
00:42:41,645 --> 00:42:42,813
Get back to work!

768
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:44,398
No one understands my art.

769
00:42:44,481 --> 00:42:45,482
Moonwind, listen,

770
00:42:45,566 --> 00:42:48,151
I gotta get out of here and back in there.

771
00:42:48,318 --> 00:42:49,319
Well, we'll have to perform

772
00:42:49,403 --> 00:42:51,280
an old-fashioned astral
transmigration displacement.

773
00:42:51,363 --> 00:42:52,573
- A what?
- It's simply a way

774
00:42:52,656 --> 00:42:54,074
to get your souls back where they belong.

775
00:42:54,157 --> 00:42:55,701
And it's a glorious ritual, indeed,

776
00:42:55,784 --> 00:42:58,537
full of chanting, dancing,
and best of all, bongos.

777
00:42:58,704 --> 00:43:01,874
I need to be at The Half Note by 7:00,
so this needs to happen right now.

778
00:43:01,957 --> 00:43:03,542
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Not so fast.

779
00:43:03,709 --> 00:43:05,919
You must wait for another thin spot

780
00:43:06,003 --> 00:43:07,880
to open between Earth
and the astral plane.

781
00:43:08,046 --> 00:43:09,214
And that won't occur

782
00:43:09,298 --> 00:43:11,758
until Orcus moves
into the house of Gemini.

783
00:43:11,925 --> 00:43:12,926
When is that?

784
00:43:13,010 --> 00:43:14,678
Well, the government calls it 6:30.

785
00:43:14,761 --> 00:43:15,846
Look, I'll meet you at The Half Note.

786
00:43:15,929 --> 00:43:16,930
6:30? You serious?

787
00:43:17,014 --> 00:43:18,307
I'll gather all
the necessary provisions...

788
00:43:18,390 --> 00:43:20,976
I said, get out of here! Go!

789
00:43:21,059 --> 00:43:22,394
See you
at The Half Note at 6:30!

790
00:43:22,477 --> 00:43:23,645
I'll take care of everything!

791
00:43:23,729 --> 00:43:25,606
And stay away!

792
00:43:33,614 --> 00:43:35,616
Sure are a lot of Garcias in here.

793
00:43:38,619 --> 00:43:40,787
You're out there somewhere, little soul,

794
00:43:40,871 --> 00:43:43,040
and I'm gonna find ya.

795
00:43:43,457 --> 00:43:45,459
All right, this is the last snack.

796
00:43:45,542 --> 00:43:47,544
I can barely fit into my pants as it is.

797
00:43:47,711 --> 00:43:49,505
6:30 is cutting it close. Too close.

798
00:43:49,588 --> 00:43:52,382
We gotta get back to my place
and get you cleaned up and...

799
00:43:52,466 --> 00:43:54,760
Ahh!

800
00:43:54,843 --> 00:43:57,137
We gotta hail a cab.
Hold your hand out.

801
00:43:57,304 --> 00:43:58,680
Hold it up and out.

802
00:43:59,264 --> 00:44:02,100
Man, this would be hard
even if I wasn't wearing a hospital gown.

803
00:44:04,686 --> 00:44:06,605
Go, go, go!
Just run to that one.

804
00:44:12,736 --> 00:44:14,905
Is that Teach?

805
00:44:14,988 --> 00:44:16,615
Mm, pepperoni.

806
00:44:30,796 --> 00:44:32,214
Aah, Dorothea Williams saw me.

807
00:44:32,297 --> 00:44:34,341
What am I gonna do?
She's gonna think I'm crazy.

808
00:44:34,508 --> 00:44:35,676
Maybe you should call her up

809
00:44:35,759 --> 00:44:37,469
and tell her that we're not crazy.

810
00:44:37,636 --> 00:44:40,848
I've only been a person for an hour,
and even I know that's a bad idea.

811
00:44:41,682 --> 00:44:44,560
I just gotta get back in my body
and really bring it tonight.

812
00:44:44,726 --> 00:44:47,354
How come this part is stinky
but this part smells fine?

813
00:44:47,521 --> 00:44:49,898
Never mind.
Just put those pants on.

814
00:44:50,065 --> 00:44:51,275
Sheesh, I can't believe I've been

815
00:44:51,358 --> 00:44:52,609
walking around in this city
with no pants on.

816
00:44:52,693 --> 00:44:54,194
I don't even wanna be here, remember?

817
00:44:54,278 --> 00:44:55,737
I don't want you here either. I just...

818
00:44:55,821 --> 00:44:58,031
I just wanna get back to my body,

819
00:44:58,198 --> 00:45:01,326
then get back to the club.

820
00:45:01,410 --> 00:45:02,953
What's the matter with you?

821
00:45:03,036 --> 00:45:05,998
Uh... I don't know.
It's the sun. It's just so...

822
00:45:07,666 --> 00:45:08,667
My phone!

823
00:45:08,750 --> 00:45:10,294
Um... Okay, your clothes
are rumbling again.

824
00:45:11,712 --> 00:45:13,839
Curley! Uh... No, no.

825
00:45:19,011 --> 00:45:20,053
Oops.

826
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:27,394
<i>Hey, Mr G, it's Curley.
Um...</i>

827
00:45:27,477 --> 00:45:28,687
<i>I hope you're doin' okay.</i>

828
00:45:28,854 --> 00:45:32,566
<i>Dorothea freaked out when she saw you,
and she called this other guy, Robert.</i>

829
00:45:32,733 --> 00:45:34,151
<i>He's got the gig now. I'm sorry.</i>

830
00:45:34,234 --> 00:45:35,736
No, no, no.

831
00:45:35,819 --> 00:45:36,820
<i>Look, honestly,</i>

832
00:45:36,904 --> 00:45:39,615
<i>your class was the only reason
I went to school at all.</i>

833
00:45:39,781 --> 00:45:41,366
<i>Like, I owe you a lot.</i>

834
00:45:41,450 --> 00:45:42,576
<i>So, here's the plan.</i>

835
00:45:42,659 --> 00:45:44,203
<i>Clean yourself up, put on a killer suit,</i>

836
00:45:44,286 --> 00:45:45,913
<i>and get to the club early.</i>

837
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:47,956
<i>I'm gonna try and talk to her.</i>

838
00:45:48,123 --> 00:45:51,043
<i>Just make sure you show up
looking like a million bucks, all right?</i>

839
00:45:51,585 --> 00:45:53,462
<i>I hope I see you, man.
All right. Peace.</i>

840
00:45:53,545 --> 00:45:55,422
Oh! I can get the gig back, 22.

841
00:45:55,506 --> 00:45:56,798
I need your help. I have a suit.

842
00:45:57,132 --> 00:45:58,258
I'm gonna need you to try it on.

843
00:45:58,342 --> 00:45:59,343
No, no, no.

844
00:45:59,426 --> 00:46:01,011
And then I can line
my hair up a little bit,

845
00:46:01,094 --> 00:46:03,305
- and I can...
- Nope. No way, no how.

846
00:46:03,472 --> 00:46:04,598
22!

847
00:46:08,185 --> 00:46:09,728
- Mr Gardner?
- Ah!

848
00:46:09,811 --> 00:46:11,271
It's Connie.
She's here for her lesson.

849
00:46:11,355 --> 00:46:13,065
- What do I do?
- I can hear you!

850
00:46:13,232 --> 00:46:14,733
Just tell her that you can't do it today.

851
00:46:15,484 --> 00:46:16,485
Hi, Connie.

852
00:46:16,568 --> 00:46:17,653
Sorry, but Joe can't do it today.

853
00:46:17,736 --> 00:46:18,862
- You're Joe!
- I mean, me.

854
00:46:18,946 --> 00:46:20,113
Me can't do it today.

855
00:46:20,197 --> 00:46:21,823
Good. Now let's go
check out that suit.

856
00:46:21,907 --> 00:46:23,992
I came to tell you that I quit.

857
00:46:24,159 --> 00:46:25,160
Quit?

858
00:46:25,244 --> 00:46:27,204
We don't have time for this.
The suit is in the closet.

859
00:46:27,287 --> 00:46:30,082
Band is a stupid waste of time.

860
00:46:30,249 --> 00:46:31,375
This kid is talking sense.

861
00:46:31,542 --> 00:46:32,543
What are you doing?

862
00:46:35,379 --> 00:46:37,631
Here, I quit.
I think jazz is pointless.

863
00:46:37,714 --> 00:46:39,842
Oh, yeah, jazz is definitely pointless.

864
00:46:39,925 --> 00:46:40,926
Hey!

865
00:46:41,009 --> 00:46:43,053
In fact, all of school is a waste of time.

866
00:46:44,888 --> 00:46:47,516
Of course. Like my mentor,
George Orwell, used to say,

867
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:48,851
"State sponsored education

868
00:46:48,934 --> 00:46:51,478
"is like the rattling of a stick
inside a swill bucket."

869
00:46:51,562 --> 00:46:52,688
Yeah!

870
00:46:52,855 --> 00:46:54,940
The ruling class's core
curriculum stifles dissent.

871
00:46:55,023 --> 00:46:56,358
It's the oldest trick in the book.

872
00:46:56,441 --> 00:46:57,442
What are you talkin' about?

873
00:46:57,526 --> 00:46:58,569
She doesn't care about any of that.

874
00:46:58,652 --> 00:47:00,571
I've been saying that
since the third grade.

875
00:47:00,654 --> 00:47:02,573
You know, you seem really smart.

876
00:47:02,739 --> 00:47:04,616
What is your position on pizza?

877
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:07,244
- Uh, I like it?
- Me, too!

878
00:47:07,327 --> 00:47:09,288
What are you doing?

879
00:47:09,371 --> 00:47:10,914
I'd rather hang with Connie.

880
00:47:11,415 --> 00:47:13,125
What? Come back here!
You open this...

881
00:47:15,419 --> 00:47:17,880
Um, I think your cat wants to get out.

882
00:47:17,963 --> 00:47:19,256
Ugh, he thinks he knows everything.

883
00:47:19,423 --> 00:47:21,216
22! Don't you walk away from me.

884
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:22,301
Come here right now.

885
00:47:22,384 --> 00:47:24,261
I'm gonna go in
and I'mma scratch up the sofa.

886
00:47:24,428 --> 00:47:25,679
Oh, wait a minute, that's my sofa.

887
00:47:25,846 --> 00:47:27,389
You really got things figured out, Connie.

888
00:47:27,472 --> 00:47:30,559
I'd better give this back.
It belongs to the school.

889
00:47:30,642 --> 00:47:31,685
Sure.

890
00:47:31,768 --> 00:47:33,187
You know, I really am glad
there's someone else

891
00:47:33,270 --> 00:47:34,813
who sees how ridiculous this place is.

892
00:47:34,897 --> 00:47:36,481
You're right to quit.
I learned about quitting...

893
00:47:36,565 --> 00:47:37,691
You know what, Mr G?

894
00:47:37,774 --> 00:47:39,401
I was practising this one thing yesterday

895
00:47:39,484 --> 00:47:43,071
and maybe you can listen to it
and tell me to quit after, okay?

896
00:47:46,325 --> 00:47:48,118
Uh, okay.

897
00:48:18,774 --> 00:48:21,777
Wow. You really love this.

898
00:48:22,611 --> 00:48:23,820
Yeah.

899
00:48:24,613 --> 00:48:27,449
So, maybe I'd better stick with it?

900
00:48:27,950 --> 00:48:29,034
Yeah.

901
00:48:29,409 --> 00:48:30,619
Bye, Mr G.

902
00:48:30,702 --> 00:48:32,120
See you next week!

903
00:48:32,287 --> 00:48:33,664
22!

904
00:48:34,706 --> 00:48:37,167
So, Connie came here to quit,

905
00:48:37,251 --> 00:48:38,252
but then she didn't.

906
00:48:38,335 --> 00:48:39,753
22, forget about that. Listen.

907
00:48:39,837 --> 00:48:41,839
I need to know this, Joe.
Why didn't she quit?

908
00:48:42,005 --> 00:48:43,090
Because she loves to play.

909
00:48:43,173 --> 00:48:46,677
She might say she hates everything,
but trombone is her thing.

910
00:48:46,844 --> 00:48:48,011
She's good at it.

911
00:48:48,095 --> 00:48:50,430
Maybe trombone is her spark, I don't know.

912
00:48:50,597 --> 00:48:54,142
Please. If I'm gonna get this gig back,
I need your help.

913
00:48:54,810 --> 00:48:55,811
Okay.

914
00:48:56,186 --> 00:48:57,187
Really?

915
00:48:57,271 --> 00:49:00,315
I'll help you,
but I wanna try a few things.

916
00:49:00,399 --> 00:49:01,525
'Cause I don't know,

917
00:49:01,608 --> 00:49:04,862
some of it's not as boring
as it is at the You Seminar,

918
00:49:05,028 --> 00:49:06,947
and if Connie can find
something she loves here,

919
00:49:07,030 --> 00:49:08,365
maybe I can, too.

920
00:49:08,448 --> 00:49:10,951
- Great!
- So, what do we do first?

921
00:49:14,329 --> 00:49:15,914
- This water hurts!
- It's okay.

922
00:49:15,998 --> 00:49:17,624
You just have to turn the other knob.

923
00:49:17,708 --> 00:49:18,792
Oh, okay, that's better.

924
00:49:18,876 --> 00:49:20,043
And I wouldn't be mad

925
00:49:20,127 --> 00:49:22,212
if you put a little lotion
on me when you're done.

926
00:49:27,009 --> 00:49:28,802
I washed your butt for you.

927
00:49:30,053 --> 00:49:31,930
Ah! Spicy! Spicy!

928
00:49:37,936 --> 00:49:40,105
You five will be insecure.

929
00:49:40,272 --> 00:49:42,900
And you 12 will be self-absorbed.

930
00:49:43,066 --> 00:49:45,569
We really should stop sending
so many through that pavilion.

931
00:49:45,736 --> 00:49:46,737
Found him!

932
00:49:46,820 --> 00:49:47,821
See that, everybody?

933
00:49:47,905 --> 00:49:49,239
Who figured out why the count's off?

934
00:49:49,323 --> 00:49:50,324
That's right, Terry did.

935
00:49:50,407 --> 00:49:51,450
It's Terrytime.

936
00:49:51,617 --> 00:49:53,869
- Wow. Nice work.
- Well, who is it?

937
00:49:54,036 --> 00:49:55,454
Right.

938
00:49:55,537 --> 00:49:58,332
Uh... Joe Gardner is his name.

939
00:49:58,498 --> 00:50:00,417
Looks like he's back down on Earth.

940
00:50:00,501 --> 00:50:01,502
That's not good.

941
00:50:01,585 --> 00:50:03,086
That... That's the mentor
we set up with 22.

942
00:50:03,253 --> 00:50:05,547
All right, all right.
Easy on the hysterics.

943
00:50:05,714 --> 00:50:08,509
Terry's got this under control.
I'll handle it.

944
00:50:08,592 --> 00:50:09,593
How?

945
00:50:09,676 --> 00:50:10,677
I'll go down there and get him.

946
00:50:10,761 --> 00:50:12,095
Set the count right, lickety-split.

947
00:50:12,179 --> 00:50:14,139
Okay, whoa.
Are you sure that's a good idea?

948
00:50:14,223 --> 00:50:16,475
Look, you all are the ones who beefed it.

949
00:50:16,558 --> 00:50:18,101
I'm trying to un-beef it.

950
00:50:18,602 --> 00:50:20,103
But you cannot be seen.

951
00:50:20,270 --> 00:50:21,480
By anyone.

952
00:50:21,563 --> 00:50:24,650
Don't worry. I'll make sure
no one else sees me.

953
00:50:24,816 --> 00:50:27,778
I'll move among the shadows, like a ninja.

954
00:50:27,945 --> 00:50:30,280
Please, just do it quickly and quietly.

955
00:50:30,447 --> 00:50:33,367
And also quickly.
And quietly as well.

956
00:50:36,954 --> 00:50:39,957
This won't be a disaster, that's for sure.

957
00:50:40,958 --> 00:50:44,503
Mm. Trusty old brown suit.
Still a perfect fit.

958
00:50:44,670 --> 00:50:46,672
It's a little tight in the back-here part.

959
00:50:46,839 --> 00:50:48,632
It'll loosen. Sit down.

960
00:50:50,050 --> 00:50:51,051
I'm a cat.

961
00:50:52,344 --> 00:50:53,387
I'll do it.

962
00:50:53,470 --> 00:50:54,596
You couldn't call an elevator, remember?

963
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:57,891
No way. I just need to line me up.
Now be still.

964
00:51:00,727 --> 00:51:02,980
Uh, it's like a little tiny chainsaw.

965
00:51:03,146 --> 00:51:05,315
- Don't move.
- I'm not moving. You're moving.

966
00:51:13,949 --> 00:51:15,284
Oh, no!

967
00:51:15,367 --> 00:51:16,493
Don't worry, I'm okay.

968
00:51:16,577 --> 00:51:19,454
Oh, no, no, no! My hair!
My hair is not okay!

969
00:51:19,538 --> 00:51:20,873
This is a disaster!

970
00:51:21,290 --> 00:51:23,041
We gotta fix this. Right now.

971
00:51:23,208 --> 00:51:25,460
- Okay. How?
- We gotta go see Dez.

972
00:51:25,627 --> 00:51:27,546
Great. Who's Dez?

973
00:51:27,713 --> 00:51:29,047
Yo, Ian, man, how you get

974
00:51:29,131 --> 00:51:30,591
that big peanut head?
What happened to you?

975
00:51:30,757 --> 00:51:33,635
Man, shut up, man.
You know I'm sensitive about that.

976
00:51:33,802 --> 00:51:35,179
Dez is the guy in the back.

977
00:51:35,262 --> 00:51:36,305
He can fix this.

978
00:51:36,471 --> 00:51:37,806
Talk about havin' a spark.

979
00:51:37,890 --> 00:51:39,433
This guy was born to be a barber.

980
00:51:39,641 --> 00:51:42,227
But I can't pass for you
in front of all your friends.

981
00:51:42,394 --> 00:51:43,937
Dez is the only one that I talk to.

982
00:51:44,021 --> 00:51:45,439
We usually talk about jazz,

983
00:51:45,606 --> 00:51:48,400
but this time, just sit there,
get the cut, and get out.

984
00:51:52,070 --> 00:51:53,947
Hey, Joe. What are you
doing here on a weekday?

985
00:51:54,031 --> 00:51:56,158
You didn't call for an appointment, man.
It's gonna be a while.

986
00:51:56,533 --> 00:51:59,077
Ah, I was afraid of this.
Go ahead and sit down.

987
00:51:59,536 --> 00:52:01,121
Oh, my Lord.

988
00:52:01,205 --> 00:52:02,539
You gotta wait, son.
This is an emergency.

989
00:52:02,706 --> 00:52:03,999
What? That ain't cool, Dez.

990
00:52:04,166 --> 00:52:05,459
You could always let Harold cut your hair.

991
00:52:05,542 --> 00:52:06,919
His chair's wide open.

992
00:52:07,419 --> 00:52:09,004
Nah. I can wait.

993
00:52:09,171 --> 00:52:11,340
Joe, get your butt in this chair now.

994
00:52:14,134 --> 00:52:15,677
Should I even ask you how this happened?

995
00:52:15,844 --> 00:52:17,596
- The cat did it.
- Stop sounding insane.

996
00:52:17,763 --> 00:52:19,723
I mean, um, I was distracted

997
00:52:19,806 --> 00:52:21,558
getting ready to play with
Dorothea Williams tonight.

998
00:52:21,725 --> 00:52:24,186
Dorothea Williams?
That's big time, Joe.

999
00:52:24,269 --> 00:52:26,146
Congratulations!

1000
00:52:26,313 --> 00:52:28,148
Joe ain't getting no gig, Dez.

1001
00:52:28,232 --> 00:52:30,442
You know he Mr Close-But-No-Cigar.

1002
00:52:30,526 --> 00:52:31,735
This guy.

1003
00:52:31,818 --> 00:52:33,695
Joe, ignore him.
Now let's fix you up.

1004
00:52:34,071 --> 00:52:35,280
You keeping that cat on your lap?

1005
00:52:35,447 --> 00:52:36,657
Is it okay that I do that?

1006
00:52:36,823 --> 00:52:38,909
Suit yourself. You're the boss.

1007
00:52:39,451 --> 00:52:40,786
- I am?
- When you're in this chair,

1008
00:52:40,869 --> 00:52:41,954
yeah, you are.

1009
00:52:42,162 --> 00:52:43,997
So can I have one of those?

1010
00:52:45,290 --> 00:52:46,792
Uh... Sure, Joe.

1011
00:52:49,586 --> 00:52:50,796
Cool.

1012
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:54,967
Mmm. I like being in the chair.

1013
00:52:55,133 --> 00:52:56,426
Hey, get your head in the game.

1014
00:52:56,510 --> 00:52:57,594
Little chainsaw.

1015
00:52:57,678 --> 00:52:59,179
You need to settle down.
If you keep this...

1016
00:53:01,723 --> 00:53:03,267
Look, I can deal with some freaky stuff,

1017
00:53:03,433 --> 00:53:04,852
but if this cat don't chill,

1018
00:53:04,935 --> 00:53:06,311
we're gonna have to put it outside.

1019
00:53:06,478 --> 00:53:08,438
Well, what's it gonna be, kitty?

1020
00:53:08,981 --> 00:53:10,190
Meow.

1021
00:53:10,357 --> 00:53:11,984
Sometimes, change is good.

1022
00:53:12,067 --> 00:53:14,236
You have been rocking
that same style for a while.

1023
00:53:14,403 --> 00:53:17,489
Well, Dez, for hundreds of years,
I've had no style at all.

1024
00:53:17,656 --> 00:53:20,033
You can say that again.

1025
00:53:20,993 --> 00:53:22,494
Mmm. But then my life changed.

1026
00:53:22,661 --> 00:53:23,704
Oh, yeah? What happened?

1027
00:53:23,871 --> 00:53:25,914
I was existing as a theoretical construct

1028
00:53:25,998 --> 00:53:27,374
in a hypothetical way station

1029
00:53:27,541 --> 00:53:28,584
between life and death.

1030
00:53:28,750 --> 00:53:29,751
I heard that.

1031
00:53:30,419 --> 00:53:33,046
And by the time
I got to mentor number 266,

1032
00:53:33,213 --> 00:53:36,216
I was seriously asking, like,
what is all the fuss about?

1033
00:53:36,383 --> 00:53:39,469
Like, is all this living
really worth dying for?

1034
00:53:39,553 --> 00:53:41,180
You know what I mean?

1035
00:53:42,389 --> 00:53:45,684
I never knew you had
such an interesting education, Joe.

1036
00:53:45,851 --> 00:53:47,686
I just thought you went to music school.

1037
00:53:47,853 --> 00:53:50,647
And another thing,
they say you're born to do something,

1038
00:53:50,814 --> 00:53:52,357
but how do you figure out
what that thing is?

1039
00:53:52,524 --> 00:53:54,443
I mean, what if you pick up
the wrong thing?

1040
00:53:54,526 --> 00:53:55,861
Or somebody else's thing, you know?

1041
00:53:56,028 --> 00:53:57,738
- Then you're stuck.
- Been there before.

1042
00:53:58,030 --> 00:53:59,281
I'll take one of those.

1043
00:53:59,448 --> 00:54:00,949
I wouldn't call myself stuck,

1044
00:54:01,033 --> 00:54:02,993
but I never planned on
cuttin' heads for a livin'.

1045
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:05,913
Wait, but you were born to be a barber,
weren't you?

1046
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:07,414
I wanted to be a veterinarian.

1047
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:10,000
So, why didn't you do that?

1048
00:54:10,209 --> 00:54:12,294
I was plannin' to
when I got out of the Navy.

1049
00:54:12,461 --> 00:54:14,296
Then my daughter got sick,

1050
00:54:14,379 --> 00:54:15,839
and barber school
is a lot cheaper

1051
00:54:15,923 --> 00:54:16,924
than veterinarian school.

1052
00:54:17,007 --> 00:54:18,050
Well, that's too bad.

1053
00:54:18,133 --> 00:54:19,968
You're stuck as a barber
and now you're unhappy.

1054
00:54:20,052 --> 00:54:21,845
Whoa, whoa, slow your roll there, Joe.

1055
00:54:21,929 --> 00:54:23,263
I'm happy as a clam, my man.

1056
00:54:23,430 --> 00:54:26,391
Not everyone can be Charles Drew
inventing blood transfusions.

1057
00:54:26,558 --> 00:54:28,685
Or me, playing piano
with Dorothea Williams.

1058
00:54:28,769 --> 00:54:29,770
I know.

1059
00:54:29,853 --> 00:54:31,396
You are not all that.

1060
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:33,065
Anyone could play in a band
if they wanted to.

1061
00:54:33,398 --> 00:54:34,441
Don't pay Paul any mind.

1062
00:54:34,608 --> 00:54:36,568
People like him just bring
other people down

1063
00:54:36,652 --> 00:54:38,445
so they can make themselves feel better.

1064
00:54:38,529 --> 00:54:40,113
Oh, I get it.

1065
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:43,200
He's just criticising me to cover up
the pain of his own failed dreams.

1066
00:54:45,244 --> 00:54:46,954
You cut deep, Joe.

1067
00:54:47,287 --> 00:54:50,290
I wonder why sitting in this chair
makes me want to tell you things, Dez.

1068
00:54:50,457 --> 00:54:53,669
That's the magic of the chair.
That's why I love this job.

1069
00:54:53,836 --> 00:54:56,088
I get to meet interesting folks like you,

1070
00:54:56,171 --> 00:54:59,299
make them happy, and make them handsome.

1071
00:54:59,466 --> 00:55:01,885
Wow! Am I crazy or do I look younger?

1072
00:55:02,052 --> 00:55:04,137
I may not have invented
blood transfusions,

1073
00:55:04,221 --> 00:55:07,724
but I am most definitely savin' lives.

1074
00:55:08,267 --> 00:55:11,019
I don't know about
this crazy cat guy thing, man,

1075
00:55:11,186 --> 00:55:15,107
but it is nice to finally talk to you
about something other than jazz, Joe.

1076
00:55:15,190 --> 00:55:18,277
Huh. How come we, um, never
talked about your life before?

1077
00:55:18,443 --> 00:55:19,820
You never asked.

1078
00:55:19,903 --> 00:55:21,363
But I'm glad you did this time.

1079
00:55:21,530 --> 00:55:23,532
- Looking good, brother.
- Have a great show.

1080
00:55:23,782 --> 00:55:26,326
I grabbed
a couple of road lollies.

1081
00:55:31,707 --> 00:55:33,750
<i>Dr Charma, call 3-1-6-2.</i>

1082
00:55:37,212 --> 00:55:38,505
Mm.

1083
00:55:40,883 --> 00:55:42,050
Mm-hmm.

1084
00:55:50,309 --> 00:55:51,310
Mm.

1085
00:55:55,939 --> 00:55:57,232
Oh.

1086
00:55:59,318 --> 00:56:01,612
Julia Child didn't succeed
till she was 49.

1087
00:56:01,778 --> 00:56:03,697
Hey, Paul. Here, have a lollipop.

1088
00:56:03,864 --> 00:56:05,782
Oh, yeah, thanks.
Thanks, man.

1089
00:56:05,949 --> 00:56:07,284
There you are.

1090
00:56:08,368 --> 00:56:10,037
No hard feelings, right? All right.

1091
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:11,121
Just friends.

1092
00:56:11,205 --> 00:56:12,414
Just friends goofing on each other.
All right.

1093
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:14,416
Okay. Goodbye, Paul.

1094
00:56:15,167 --> 00:56:16,251
Come to Terry.

1095
00:56:17,794 --> 00:56:18,921
Gotcha!

1096
00:56:20,088 --> 00:56:21,548
Thought you could cheat the universe?

1097
00:56:21,632 --> 00:56:22,633
Well, you thought wrong.

1098
00:56:22,716 --> 00:56:25,010
I'm the accountant,
and I'm here to bring you in...

1099
00:56:25,093 --> 00:56:27,679
Oh, whoa...
You're not Joe Gardner.

1100
00:56:28,931 --> 00:56:30,015
My mistake.

1101
00:56:30,098 --> 00:56:33,143
We'll just get you back into
your meat suit.

1102
00:56:34,603 --> 00:56:35,938
There you go.

1103
00:56:36,021 --> 00:56:37,523
No harm, no foul.

1104
00:56:38,315 --> 00:56:40,484
Oh, boy. Look, uh, fella,

1105
00:56:40,651 --> 00:56:41,944
I'm thinking there's no reason

1106
00:56:42,027 --> 00:56:44,112
we can't keep this little
incident between us, eh?

1107
00:56:44,279 --> 00:56:46,782
Mistakes happen.
And, uh, it's not your time.

1108
00:56:46,949 --> 00:56:48,283
Unless you keep eating

1109
00:56:48,367 --> 00:56:50,911
those processed foods,
am I right?

1110
00:56:54,039 --> 00:56:57,042
But seriously, stay away
from those processed foods.

1111
00:57:01,797 --> 00:57:03,257
You know what,
you did all right back there.

1112
00:57:03,340 --> 00:57:04,591
How did you know how to deal with Paul?

1113
00:57:04,758 --> 00:57:06,385
I didn't. I just let out the me.

1114
00:57:06,552 --> 00:57:09,763
Hey, like you said about jazz.
I was jazzing.

1115
00:57:09,847 --> 00:57:11,974
First of all,
"jazzing" is not a word.

1116
00:57:12,140 --> 00:57:15,435
And second, music and life
operate by very different rules.

1117
00:57:15,602 --> 00:57:16,728
It says take one.

1118
00:57:16,895 --> 00:57:19,273
Don't... Or do. Okay. Fine.

1119
00:57:19,439 --> 00:57:20,774
"Man with a van."

1120
00:57:20,858 --> 00:57:22,526
I got a few in case we need a lot of vans.

1121
00:57:23,110 --> 00:57:24,611
Uh-huh. Now, let's get back to the plan.

1122
00:57:24,778 --> 00:57:27,239
We go to The Half Note
and wait there for Moonwind.

1123
00:57:27,406 --> 00:57:28,740
It's around 4:00 p.m. now...

1124
00:57:30,576 --> 00:57:31,577
You know what?

1125
00:57:31,660 --> 00:57:32,911
You are really getting good
at using those legs.

1126
00:57:32,995 --> 00:57:34,913
Why don't you try runnin'?

1127
00:57:34,997 --> 00:57:37,583
Hey! I made a song.
I'm jazzing.

1128
00:57:37,666 --> 00:57:39,835
Okay, enough of the jazzing
and everything like that.

1129
00:57:39,918 --> 00:57:41,378
We need to get somewhere.
Now, I...

1130
00:57:41,461 --> 00:57:43,881
- That tickles.
- Uh, what are you doing?

1131
00:57:50,971 --> 00:57:52,514
Whoops. I got it.

1132
00:57:55,851 --> 00:57:56,935
Would you hurry up?

1133
00:57:57,102 --> 00:57:58,270
Okay.

1134
00:58:00,022 --> 00:58:02,024
You were right.
These pants are loosening.

1135
00:58:02,107 --> 00:58:03,859
Oh, no, no, no.

1136
00:58:03,942 --> 00:58:05,194
Don't let people see your butt!

1137
00:58:05,277 --> 00:58:07,404
- It's your butt.
- It doesn't matter whose butt...

1138
00:58:07,487 --> 00:58:09,198
Take off the jacket.
Tie it around your waist.

1139
00:58:09,364 --> 00:58:11,116
Quick! Cover the butt!

1140
00:58:11,283 --> 00:58:12,618
What are we gonna do?

1141
00:58:12,784 --> 00:58:14,494
I can't find a tailor this late...

1142
00:58:15,662 --> 00:58:17,247
Oh, no. We're gonna have to go to Mom's.

1143
00:58:17,331 --> 00:58:18,332
Okay.

1144
00:58:18,415 --> 00:58:19,499
No, no, no, you don't understand.

1145
00:58:19,583 --> 00:58:20,626
Mom doesn't know about this gig.

1146
00:58:20,709 --> 00:58:21,710
And she's not gonna like it.

1147
00:58:21,793 --> 00:58:22,794
Okay.

1148
00:58:22,878 --> 00:58:23,921
We don't have any other choice.

1149
00:58:24,004 --> 00:58:25,005
Okay.

1150
00:58:25,088 --> 00:58:26,673
She's the only one that can fix this.

1151
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:28,342
- Okay.
- Stop saying "okay"!

1152
00:58:28,509 --> 00:58:30,511
We gotta catch the subway across town.
Come on.

1153
00:58:30,677 --> 00:58:32,638
Okay... Got it.

1154
00:58:34,223 --> 00:58:36,308
My mom doesn't know
anything about the gig,

1155
00:58:36,391 --> 00:58:37,726
and I wanna keep it that way, okay?

1156
00:58:37,893 --> 00:58:39,269
Right, because she thinks
you're a failure.

1157
00:58:39,353 --> 00:58:40,646
- What?
- I didn't say that.

1158
00:58:40,729 --> 00:58:41,980
You did. Up here.

1159
00:58:42,147 --> 00:58:44,483
Uh, look, my mom has her own
definition of what success is,

1160
00:58:44,650 --> 00:58:46,902
and being a professional musician
isn't it.

1161
00:58:47,069 --> 00:58:52,074
So, let me see, I need the suit fixed
for a, uh, school band recital.

1162
00:58:52,157 --> 00:58:55,702
I'm not looking forward to this,
but there's no reason she needs to know...

It does that to some people.

- Does what?
- It wears you down.

1190
01:00:10,068 --> 01:00:12,362
It stinks. It's hot. It's crowded.

1191
01:00:12,529 --> 01:00:15,782
Every day the same thing,
day in and day out.

1192
01:00:16,408 --> 01:00:18,619
But once I get on the stage tonight,

1193
01:00:18,702 --> 01:00:20,579
all my troubles are going to be fixed.

1194
01:00:20,746 --> 01:00:23,248
You're gonna see a brand-new Joe Gardner.

1195
01:00:26,376 --> 01:00:27,377
Where'd you get that?

1196
01:00:27,544 --> 01:00:29,004
Under the seat.
Can you believe it?

1197
01:00:29,087 --> 01:00:31,173
It's still half-full.

1198
01:00:32,758 --> 01:00:34,593
All right, remember,

1199
01:00:34,676 --> 01:00:37,721
I need the suit fixed for a band recital.
Got it?

1200
01:00:41,225 --> 01:00:44,186
- Joey! Oh, baby boy...
- Joey!

1201
01:00:44,269 --> 01:00:46,355
- Oh, I'm so proud of you.
- ...we heard the news.

1202
01:00:48,732 --> 01:00:49,733
Oh, crap. She knows.

1203
01:00:49,900 --> 01:00:51,443
Your momma's in the back.

1204
01:00:51,610 --> 01:00:53,237
- You gotta go in there.
- No, I don't want to.

1205
01:00:53,403 --> 01:00:55,739
You have to.
We need the suit fixed.

1206
01:00:58,075 --> 01:00:59,952
You forgetting something, Joey?

1207
01:01:00,118 --> 01:01:01,161
- What?
- Kiss her.

1208
01:01:01,370 --> 01:01:03,497
I always kiss Melba when I see her.

1209
01:01:05,832 --> 01:01:07,251
Just do it.

1210
01:01:11,255 --> 01:01:12,881
No, no, no. Not on the lips.

1211
01:01:12,965 --> 01:01:15,008
Joey!
What has gotten into you, boy?

1212
01:01:15,092 --> 01:01:16,134
Let him finish.

1213
01:01:16,218 --> 01:01:17,302
Cougar. I knew it.

1214
01:01:17,469 --> 01:01:20,389
I'll take another kiss
when you get back, Joey.

1215
01:01:24,935 --> 01:01:27,938
So much for being done
chasing after gigs, huh?

1216
01:01:28,272 --> 01:01:31,692
I hope that cat isn't supposed to be
some kind of peace offering.

1217
01:01:31,859 --> 01:01:33,068
Come. Come on.

1218
01:01:33,235 --> 01:01:34,319
Just say you rescued it.

1219
01:01:34,403 --> 01:01:36,780
Um, no. It's mine. I rescued it.

1220
01:01:36,864 --> 01:01:39,157
Hmm. Too bad you can't rescue your career.

1221
01:01:39,241 --> 01:01:40,325
Oh.

1222
01:01:40,409 --> 01:01:43,537
Just ask her nicely
if she can fix my suit.

1223
01:01:43,704 --> 01:01:47,374
So, Mom, is there any way
you can fix this?

1224
01:01:47,457 --> 01:01:48,917
Whoa! I don't need to see that.

1225
01:01:49,084 --> 01:01:51,128
I know. Embarrassing, right?

1226
01:01:51,295 --> 01:01:52,796
So, you'll fix it?

1227
01:01:52,963 --> 01:01:54,089
- No.
- What?

1228
01:01:54,173 --> 01:01:56,466
How long are you going
to keep doing this, Joey?

1229
01:01:56,550 --> 01:01:58,760
You tell me you're going
to accept the full-time position...

1230
01:01:58,844 --> 01:01:59,845
Here it comes.

1231
01:01:59,928 --> 01:02:01,221
...and instead,
I hear you've taken another gig.

1232
01:02:01,305 --> 01:02:02,431
Tell her that this one is different.

1233
01:02:02,514 --> 01:02:03,515
This one's different!

1234
01:02:03,599 --> 01:02:05,851
Does this gig have a pension?
Health insurance?

1235
01:02:06,226 --> 01:02:08,896
No? Then it's the same as the other ones.

1236
01:02:09,062 --> 01:02:10,981
It's like you can't even
be truthful with me anymore.

1237
01:02:11,148 --> 01:02:13,108
Fine, we'll get the suit
off the rack somewhere.

1238
01:02:13,275 --> 01:02:16,153
My mom has never understood
what I'm trying to do with my life.

1239
01:02:16,236 --> 01:02:17,863
Fine, we'll get the suit
off the rack somewhere.

1240
01:02:17,946 --> 01:02:19,615
My mom has never understood

1241
01:02:19,698 --> 01:02:20,782
what I'm trying to do with my life.

1242
01:02:20,866 --> 01:02:22,784
- 22!
- What did you just say?

1243
01:02:22,868 --> 01:02:25,120
Oof. Can I run away now,
like you usually do?

1244
01:02:27,581 --> 01:02:30,584
No. Not this time.
Repeat after me.

1245
01:02:31,126 --> 01:02:33,504
Mom, I know we've had some rough times,

1246
01:02:33,962 --> 01:02:35,506
but you're right,

1247
01:02:36,006 --> 01:02:38,258
I can't be truthful with you.

1248
01:02:38,425 --> 01:02:41,261
Because it seems like
no matter what I do, you disapprove.

1249
01:02:41,428 --> 01:02:43,472
Look, I know you love playing.

1250
01:02:43,639 --> 01:02:46,642
Then how come except for church,
you're the happiest when I don't?

1251
01:02:46,808 --> 01:02:50,020
I finally land the gig of my life
and you're upset.

1252
01:02:50,187 --> 01:02:52,981
You didn't see how tough
being a musician was on your father.

1253
01:02:53,148 --> 01:02:54,983
I don't want to see
you struggle like that.

1254
01:02:55,150 --> 01:02:57,236
So Dad could pursue his dreams,
and I can't?

1255
01:02:57,402 --> 01:02:59,279
Your father had me.

1256
01:02:59,446 --> 01:03:02,282
Most times,
this shop is what paid the bills.

1257
01:03:02,449 --> 01:03:04,993
So when I'm gone, who's gonna pay yours?

1258
01:03:05,160 --> 01:03:06,620
Music is all I think about.

1259
01:03:06,787 --> 01:03:08,872
From the moment I wake up in the morning

1260
01:03:08,956 --> 01:03:10,999
to the moment I fall asleep at night.

1261
01:03:11,166 --> 01:03:13,418
You can't eat dreams for breakfast, Joey.

1262
01:03:13,585 --> 01:03:14,962
Then I don't want to eat.

1263
01:03:15,128 --> 01:03:17,965
This isn't about my career, Mom.

1264
01:03:18,173 --> 01:03:20,300
It's my reason for living.

1265
01:03:20,384 --> 01:03:22,219
And I know Dad felt the same way.

1266
01:03:23,136 --> 01:03:26,431
I'm just afraid
that if I died today,

1267
01:03:26,974 --> 01:03:30,018
that my life would've amounted to nothing.

1268
01:03:32,229 --> 01:03:33,438
Joey.

1269
01:03:40,654 --> 01:03:41,655
Oh.

1270
01:03:47,870 --> 01:03:50,831
Let's make this work instead.

1271
01:03:54,793 --> 01:03:56,295
That's my dad's suit.

1272
01:03:56,461 --> 01:03:57,671
Lulu. Melba.

1273
01:03:57,754 --> 01:04:00,299
Bring your good scissors in here.
We got work to do.

1274
01:04:05,470 --> 01:04:07,389
Wow. This feels really nice.

1275
01:04:07,556 --> 01:04:09,850
- You look marvellous.
- It fits perfectly.

1276
01:04:09,933 --> 01:04:10,934
You see how I did that?

1277
01:04:11,018 --> 01:04:14,229
That is one fine wool suit,
if I do say so myself.

1278
01:04:14,396 --> 01:04:15,606
- Can I try on that?
- Of course you can.

1279
01:04:15,772 --> 01:04:17,733
Just handsome.

1280
01:04:17,900 --> 01:04:20,485
Thank you, uh, Mom.

1281
01:04:20,652 --> 01:04:23,280
Ray would have been so proud of you, baby.

1282
01:04:23,822 --> 01:04:25,824
Like I've always been.

1283
01:04:27,534 --> 01:04:28,660
You heard me, right?

1284
01:04:28,744 --> 01:04:30,996
The suit is wool, not polyester.

1285
01:04:31,163 --> 01:04:33,332
So, don't go putting that cat
on your shoulders again.

1286
01:04:33,415 --> 01:04:34,416
Yes, ma'am!

1287
01:04:34,499 --> 01:04:35,792
Oh,
there's a nice little taper there.

1288
01:04:35,959 --> 01:04:37,169
Thanks, Mom.

1289
01:04:39,838 --> 01:04:41,173
Oh, that was amazin'.

1290
01:04:41,256 --> 01:04:43,091
You know what that felt like?
It felt like jazz.

1291
01:04:43,258 --> 01:04:44,676
Yeah, you were jazzing.

1292
01:04:44,843 --> 01:04:46,595
Ha-ha. Okay, jazzing.

1293
01:04:48,388 --> 01:04:49,431
I'm telling you, Joe.

1294
01:04:49,515 --> 01:04:51,058
You really should call Lisa again.

1295
01:04:51,225 --> 01:04:53,936
I don't really have time
for a relationship right now, 22.

1296
01:04:54,102 --> 01:04:55,479
Oh, busy right now?

1297
01:04:55,562 --> 01:04:56,897
Wanna wait till you die a second time?

1298
01:04:57,064 --> 01:04:58,232
Cool, cool, cool.

1299
01:04:58,398 --> 01:05:00,025
I can't believe
I'm getting romantic advice

1300
01:05:00,108 --> 01:05:01,193
from an unborn soul.

1301
01:05:01,276 --> 01:05:02,903
I can think of worse.

1302
01:05:03,070 --> 01:05:04,279
There it is.

1303
01:05:05,405 --> 01:05:10,160
We made it!
This is going to work.

1304
01:05:10,244 --> 01:05:12,454
Whoa! I can't believe how good I look.

1305
01:05:12,621 --> 01:05:15,457
The suit, the cut.
Just look at me.

1306
01:05:21,338 --> 01:05:23,465
- Ooh, just turn a little bit right there.
- Like this?

1307
01:05:23,549 --> 01:05:25,634
- Angle the shoulders, and...
- Oh, hey, who's that?

1308
01:05:25,717 --> 01:05:26,760
- And from this side.
- That's it.

1309
01:05:26,844 --> 01:05:27,886
What? Who's back here?

1310
01:05:27,970 --> 01:05:29,555
- Still me. Uh-huh.
- That's a winner.

1311
01:05:29,638 --> 01:05:31,849
Right?

1312
01:05:32,891 --> 01:05:34,852
This can't be happenin'.
Now, I'm not gonna believe this.

1313
01:05:35,018 --> 01:05:36,645
The Half Note.

1314
01:05:40,816 --> 01:05:43,318
He made you pay for dinner?

1315
01:05:43,402 --> 01:05:44,444
Yeah...

1316
01:06:06,049 --> 01:06:07,801
- So, you ready?
- Huh?

1317
01:06:07,885 --> 01:06:09,094
To go home.

1318
01:06:09,178 --> 01:06:11,597
I bet you're ready to get off
of this stinky rock, huh?

1319
01:06:11,763 --> 01:06:13,640
What do you think of Earth, anyway?

1320
01:06:18,020 --> 01:06:20,522
I always said it was dumb. But...

1321
01:06:22,065 --> 01:06:23,150
I mean...

1322
01:06:23,650 --> 01:06:25,569
Just look at what I found.

1323
01:06:26,445 --> 01:06:29,489
Your mom sewed your suit
from this cute spool.

1324
01:06:30,032 --> 01:06:32,576
When I was nervous, Dez gave me this.

1325
01:06:32,743 --> 01:06:35,954
A guy on the subway yelled at me.
It was scary.

1326
01:06:36,538 --> 01:06:39,458
But I kind of liked that, too.

1327
01:06:43,337 --> 01:06:44,796
Truth is, I've always worried

1328
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:47,591
that maybe there's something
wrong with me. You know?

1329
01:06:48,509 --> 01:06:50,802
Maybe I'm not good enough for living.

1330
01:06:51,803 --> 01:06:58,060
But then you showed me
about purpose and passion,

1331
01:06:58,143 --> 01:07:00,312
and maybe sky-watching can be my spark.

1332
01:07:00,395 --> 01:07:02,481
Or walking.
I'm really good at walking.

1333
01:07:02,648 --> 01:07:04,358
Those really aren't purposes, 22.

1334
01:07:04,441 --> 01:07:05,734
That's just regular old living.

1335
01:07:05,901 --> 01:07:07,903
But, hey, when you get back
to the You Seminar,

1336
01:07:08,070 --> 01:07:09,446
you can give it an honest try.

1337
01:07:09,613 --> 01:07:12,199
No, but I've been at the You Seminar
for thousands of years

1338
01:07:12,366 --> 01:07:14,451
and I have never felt this close.

1339
01:07:14,618 --> 01:07:17,579
Joe! Who's ready to go home?

1340
01:07:17,746 --> 01:07:18,747
Moonwind.

1341
01:07:18,830 --> 01:07:19,873
The stars are almost in alignment.

1342
01:07:19,957 --> 01:07:20,958
All right.

1343
01:07:21,041 --> 01:07:22,251
I'll have you back
in your bodies in no time.

1344
01:07:22,626 --> 01:07:25,921
No. I've gotta find it here, on Earth.

1345
01:07:26,004 --> 01:07:28,048
This is my only chance to find my spark.

1346
01:07:28,215 --> 01:07:31,760
22, you're only loving this stuff
because you're in my body.

1347
01:07:31,927 --> 01:07:35,222
You can find your own thing to love
when you get back to the You Seminar.

1348
01:07:35,389 --> 01:07:37,641
Now, come on,
I need my body back. Now!

1349
01:07:40,310 --> 01:07:41,311
No.

1350
01:07:43,355 --> 01:07:44,898
I'm in the chair.

1351
01:07:47,025 --> 01:07:48,735
- 22!
- Leave me alone!

1352
01:07:48,902 --> 01:07:50,946
I'm trying to find my purpose!

1353
01:07:51,113 --> 01:07:52,781
22, you come back here!

1354
01:07:55,158 --> 01:07:56,493
22!

1355
01:08:04,001 --> 01:08:05,085
Mr Mittens.

1356
01:08:05,169 --> 01:08:07,045
Oh.

1357
01:08:12,801 --> 01:08:14,178
{\an8}There they are.

1358
01:08:20,809 --> 01:08:22,102
You come back here right now!

1359
01:08:24,271 --> 01:08:25,814
You stole my body!

1360
01:08:52,674 --> 01:08:55,177
It's your time to go, Joe Gardner.

1361
01:09:02,059 --> 01:09:03,060
Oh, no, you don't.

1362
01:09:05,812 --> 01:09:06,813
Gotcha!

1363
01:09:08,482 --> 01:09:10,025
No, no, no.

1364
01:09:19,910 --> 01:09:22,287
No, no!

1365
01:09:23,830 --> 01:09:25,874
I was gonna play with Dorothea Williams!

1366
01:09:26,041 --> 01:09:27,793
And I was about to find my spark!

1367
01:09:27,960 --> 01:09:29,294
Find your spark?
My life was finally going to change!

1368
01:09:29,461 --> 01:09:30,712
You promised, but you wouldn't
even give me five minutes!

1369
01:09:30,879 --> 01:09:32,005
I lost everything because of you!

1370
01:09:32,089 --> 01:09:33,090
Joe!

1371
01:09:34,341 --> 01:09:35,926
You cheated.

1372
01:09:41,348 --> 01:09:42,683
Found him.

1373
01:09:42,850 --> 01:09:44,101
- Joe Gardner.
- You're back!

1374
01:09:44,184 --> 01:09:45,227
Terry, you found them.

1375
01:09:45,310 --> 01:09:46,311
No need to thank me.

1376
01:09:46,478 --> 01:09:48,981
It's so nice to have
everything back in order, and...

1377
01:09:49,857 --> 01:09:52,067
22 got her pass?

1378
01:09:54,361 --> 01:09:55,946
- Oh, my goodness.
- 22! You got an Earth Pass!

1379
01:09:56,029 --> 01:09:57,489
This is amazing!

1380
01:09:57,656 --> 01:09:58,949
I knew you could do it.

1381
01:09:59,032 --> 01:10:00,075
This is cray cray.

1382
01:10:00,242 --> 01:10:02,995
But what...
What filled in the last box?

1383
01:10:03,161 --> 01:10:05,539
I'll tell you what filled it in. I did!

1384
01:10:05,706 --> 01:10:07,457
It was my spark that changed that badge.

1385
01:10:07,624 --> 01:10:11,128
She only got that because
she was living my life in my body.

1386
01:10:11,295 --> 01:10:13,505
- I was...
- Come on, Mr Gardner.

1387
01:10:15,007 --> 01:10:16,258
Joe, it's time for you

1388
01:10:16,341 --> 01:10:18,093
to accompany 22 to the Earth portal.

1389
01:10:18,260 --> 01:10:19,761
Give you a chance to say goodbye.

1390
01:10:19,928 --> 01:10:21,555
Of course.
It's standard procedure.

1391
01:10:21,722 --> 01:10:24,474
Just hold on a minute.
I get to set the count right.

1392
01:10:24,641 --> 01:10:27,227
Terry, you have done a super job.

1393
01:10:27,311 --> 01:10:28,353
We'll take it from here.

1394
01:10:28,437 --> 01:10:29,438
You're amazing.

1395
01:10:30,314 --> 01:10:31,481
Well, thank you.

1396
01:10:32,482 --> 01:10:34,151
Terrytime.

1397
01:10:34,651 --> 01:10:36,486
Go ahead, you two.

1398
01:10:46,538 --> 01:10:47,539
You don't know.

1399
01:10:49,082 --> 01:10:51,251
You can't be sure why my pass changed.

1400
01:10:51,627 --> 01:10:53,420
Come on, 22.
Think about it.

1401
01:10:53,587 --> 01:10:56,465
You hated music until you were in my body.

1402
01:10:56,632 --> 01:11:00,135
You hated everything until you were me.

1403
01:11:03,305 --> 01:11:04,640
I hope you enjoy it.

1404
01:11:21,698 --> 01:11:22,783
Uh...

1405
01:11:25,035 --> 01:11:27,246
I have to ask,
how the Dickens did you do it?

1406
01:11:27,412 --> 01:11:28,914
Get that Earth Pass to change?

1407
01:11:28,997 --> 01:11:31,625
Oh. You know what, I...
I just let her walk

1408
01:11:31,708 --> 01:11:33,377
a mile in my shoes, you could say.

1409
01:11:33,585 --> 01:11:34,837
Well, it worked.

1410
01:11:35,462 --> 01:11:36,547
Yeah.

1411
01:11:36,713 --> 01:11:39,466
Well, you should probably
get going to the Great Beyond.

1412
01:11:39,633 --> 01:11:42,302
Hey, um, we never found out
what 22's purpose was.

1413
01:11:42,845 --> 01:11:44,930
- Excuse me?
- You know, her, uh, spark.

1414
01:11:45,097 --> 01:11:48,767
Her purpose. Was it music?
Biology? Walking?

1415
01:11:48,934 --> 01:11:51,270
We don't assign purposes.
Where did you get that idea?

1416
01:11:51,979 --> 01:11:52,980
Because I have piano.

1417
01:11:53,063 --> 01:11:55,107
It's what I was born to do.
That's my spark.

1418
01:11:55,274 --> 01:11:57,526
A spark isn't a soul's purpose.

1419
01:11:58,193 --> 01:12:00,237
Oh, you mentors and your passions.

1420
01:12:00,404 --> 01:12:04,825
Your purposes. Your meanings of life.
So basic.

1421
01:12:04,908 --> 01:12:07,035
No, no, it...

1422
01:12:10,831 --> 01:12:12,040
Wow.

1423
01:12:12,124 --> 01:12:15,294
It is music.
My spark is music. I...

1424
01:12:16,003 --> 01:12:17,421
I know it is.

1425
01:12:23,385 --> 01:12:24,386
I'm no good.

1426
01:12:25,220 --> 01:12:26,930
I got no purpose.

1427
01:12:28,140 --> 01:12:29,474
No purpose.

1428
01:12:30,184 --> 01:12:32,186
No purpose.

1429
01:13:01,048 --> 01:13:03,217
Mr G?

1430
01:13:03,300 --> 01:13:04,885
Curley, I made it.
I'm ready to go.

1431
01:13:05,052 --> 01:13:06,220
You're too late, man.

1432
01:13:06,386 --> 01:13:07,429
Let me talk to Dorothea.

1433
01:13:07,513 --> 01:13:09,723
No, no, no, man.
She don't play that.

1434
01:13:09,932 --> 01:13:13,185
These rappers act like...
Who let this lunatic in here?

1435
01:13:13,352 --> 01:13:15,270
Listen, you gotta give me another chance.

1436
01:13:15,479 --> 01:13:18,482
This is my band.
I decide who plays.

1437
01:13:18,649 --> 01:13:20,359
And if you don't go with me,

1438
01:13:20,442 --> 01:13:22,819
you'll be making the biggest
mistake of your career.

1439
01:13:23,403 --> 01:13:25,906
Oh, yeah? Why's that?

1440
01:13:26,365 --> 01:13:29,368
My only purpose on this planet is to play.

1441
01:13:29,535 --> 01:13:32,788
It's what I was meant to do.
And nothing's gonna stop me.

1442
01:13:36,875 --> 01:13:39,753
Well, aren't you an arrogant one?

1443
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:42,840
I guess you really are a jazz player.

1444
01:13:43,006 --> 01:13:46,051
Tell Robert he's out. For now.

1445
01:13:47,219 --> 01:13:48,512
Nice suit.

1446
01:13:58,397 --> 01:14:02,234
Get ready, Joe Gardner,
your life is about to start.

1447
01:15:19,311 --> 01:15:21,438
Welcome to the quartet, Teach.

1448
01:15:25,776 --> 01:15:27,653
That's my Joey!

1449
01:15:32,658 --> 01:15:34,451
- What a show!
- That last solo was brilliant.

1450
01:15:34,618 --> 01:15:35,619
That was amazing!

1451
01:15:35,786 --> 01:15:37,120
I'm not gonna cover
that bridge for you again.

1452
01:15:37,287 --> 01:15:38,872
- Whoo! Later, Mr G.
- Congratulations.

1453
01:15:39,039 --> 01:15:40,749
You did great. We love you.

1454
01:15:40,832 --> 01:15:41,834
I'm so proud of you, Joey.

1455
01:15:41,959 --> 01:15:44,336
Gotta get to bed. We old.

1456
01:15:46,839 --> 01:15:49,466
You play 100 shows,
and one of them is killer.

1457
01:15:49,633 --> 01:15:51,510
You don't get many like tonight.

1458
01:15:51,677 --> 01:15:52,970
Yeah.

1459
01:15:54,012 --> 01:15:56,348
So, uh, what happens next?

1460
01:15:56,515 --> 01:15:59,768
We come back tomorrow night
and do it all again.

1461
01:16:02,145 --> 01:16:03,564
What's wrong, Teach?

1462
01:16:04,648 --> 01:16:09,945
It's just I've been waiting
on this day for my entire life.

1463
01:16:12,531 --> 01:16:14,408
I thought I'd feel different.

1464
01:16:17,327 --> 01:16:19,705
I heard this story about a fish.

1465
01:16:20,414 --> 01:16:22,666
He swims up to this older fish and says,

1466
01:16:22,833 --> 01:16:25,627
"I'm trying to find this thing
they call the ocean."

1467
01:16:25,794 --> 01:16:27,880
"The ocean?" says the older fish.

1468
01:16:27,963 --> 01:16:29,423
"That's what you're in right now."

1469
01:16:29,590 --> 01:16:32,801
"This?" says the young fish.
"This is water.

1470
01:16:32,968 --> 01:16:35,888
"What I want is the ocean."

1471
01:16:38,807 --> 01:16:40,517
See you tomorrow.

1472
01:16:53,447 --> 01:16:55,365
- Hey, man.
- Sorry.

1473
01:20:26,285 --> 01:20:28,203
<i>Maybe sky-watching can be my spark.</i>

1474
01:20:28,287 --> 01:20:30,622
<i>Or walking.
I'm really good at walking.</i>

1475
01:20:30,789 --> 01:20:32,541
<i>Those really aren't purposes, 22.</i>

1476
01:20:32,624 --> 01:20:34,376
<i>That's just regular old living.</i>

1477
01:21:21,089 --> 01:21:22,633
- Joe?
- Huh?

1478
01:21:23,467 --> 01:21:24,551
Joe!

1479
01:21:24,718 --> 01:21:27,179
Good heavens, man.
What are you doing in the zone?

1480
01:21:27,346 --> 01:21:30,807
Moonwind. I messed up.
I need to find 22.

1481
01:21:30,974 --> 01:21:34,269
I'm afraid she's become a lost soul.

1482
01:21:34,436 --> 01:21:35,979
- What?
- I'll explain on the way.

1483
01:21:38,941 --> 01:21:40,442
When neither of you returned
to The Half Note,

1484
01:21:40,609 --> 01:21:42,069
I suspected something had gone wrong.

1485
01:21:42,236 --> 01:21:46,198
<i>I came back here,
and that's when I spotted her.</i>

1486
01:21:48,825 --> 01:21:52,746
Lost souls are obsessed by something
that disconnects them from life.

1487
01:21:52,913 --> 01:21:56,166
And now that 22 has technically lived,
she's become one of them.

1488
01:21:56,333 --> 01:21:57,793
- There!
- Good show.

1489
01:22:04,716 --> 01:22:05,717
22!

1490
01:22:08,762 --> 01:22:10,556
- Ready the net.
- I'm on it.

1491
01:22:22,860 --> 01:22:23,986
She's got us!

1492
01:22:27,406 --> 01:22:28,407
Moonwind!

1493
01:22:28,490 --> 01:22:30,117
A captain always
goes down with the ship.

1494
01:22:30,284 --> 01:22:31,451
It has been a...

1495
01:22:37,374 --> 01:22:38,375
22!

1496
01:22:39,835 --> 01:22:41,962
Come back, 22. It's me, Joe.

1497
01:22:44,256 --> 01:22:45,465
Easy, 22, easy.

1498
01:22:45,632 --> 01:22:48,760
I just came back to give you this.

1499
01:22:51,138 --> 01:22:52,139
Easy.

1500
01:22:53,807 --> 01:22:55,809
22, listen. Come back!

1501
01:22:59,438 --> 01:23:02,107
And for correcting
our absent-minded mistakes

1502
01:23:02,191 --> 01:23:03,275
and setting the count right,

1503
01:23:03,442 --> 01:23:07,571
we are awarding you, Terry, this trophy.
As you requested.

1504
01:23:09,031 --> 01:23:12,409
I am happy to accept this
very special award I requested,

1505
01:23:12,576 --> 01:23:15,204
but that I absolutely deserve.

1506
01:23:18,248 --> 01:23:19,291
Joe Gardner?

1507
01:23:19,374 --> 01:23:20,375
And I'll just take that back.

1508
01:23:20,542 --> 01:23:21,543
Hey.

1509
01:23:23,170 --> 01:23:26,465
Oi, noob!
You're not where you belong.

1510
01:23:31,261 --> 01:23:32,888
Uh...

1511
01:23:32,971 --> 01:23:34,765
22, stop.
I have something to tell you.

1512
01:23:36,642 --> 01:23:39,269
Stop that. No.

1513
01:23:41,897 --> 01:23:43,273
22!

1514
01:23:44,274 --> 01:23:45,651
Whoa, watch out!

1515
01:23:45,817 --> 01:23:46,985
Take it easy.

1516
01:23:47,069 --> 01:23:48,111
- There, there.
- There's no need to be afraid.

1517
01:23:48,320 --> 01:23:50,447
Don't worry. Calm down.

1518
01:23:50,614 --> 01:23:52,533
You have to stop running. Please.

1519
01:23:52,699 --> 01:23:54,034
22, stop.

1520
01:23:54,284 --> 01:23:55,536
22, I was wrong.

1521
01:23:56,745 --> 01:24:00,541
Please, will you listen?
You are ready to live, 22.

1522
01:24:13,554 --> 01:24:15,514
I'm not good enough. Nope. No.

1523
01:24:15,764 --> 01:24:17,099
Nothing. I just need to
fill out that last box.

1524
01:24:17,182 --> 01:24:18,183
22!

1525
01:24:19,268 --> 01:24:20,394
You're dishonest.

1526
01:24:20,477 --> 01:24:21,895
All you make are bad decisions.

1527
01:24:22,062 --> 01:24:23,981
You are unwise and you won't
make it in the world.

1528
01:24:24,064 --> 01:24:25,107
You're so selfish.

1529
01:24:25,190 --> 01:24:26,233
No one would ever want to be around you.

1530
01:24:26,316 --> 01:24:27,442
Loser.

1531
01:24:27,609 --> 01:24:29,778
Oh, the world needs remarkable people

1532
01:24:29,945 --> 01:24:32,865
and you are the least
remarkable soul I've ever met.

1533
01:24:33,156 --> 01:24:34,992
You'll never find your spark.

1534
01:24:35,158 --> 01:24:36,159
Imbecile.

1535
01:24:36,326 --> 01:24:37,870
I cannot help you.

1536
01:24:37,953 --> 01:24:38,996
22!

1537
01:24:39,162 --> 01:24:40,747
I just need to fill out that last box.

1538
01:24:40,914 --> 01:24:42,040
I'm not good enough at all.

1539
01:24:42,332 --> 01:24:44,084
You will never find your spark.

1540
01:24:44,168 --> 01:24:45,544
There's no point.

1541
01:24:46,545 --> 01:24:48,172
Those aren't purposes,
you idiot.

1542
01:24:48,255 --> 01:24:49,840
That's just regular old living.

1543
01:24:50,007 --> 01:24:51,466
This is a waste of time.

1544
01:24:51,633 --> 01:24:54,052
You only got that badge
because you were in my body.

1545
01:24:54,219 --> 01:24:56,054
That's why you ruin everything.

1546
01:24:56,221 --> 01:24:58,891
Because you have no purpose.

1547
01:25:04,396 --> 01:25:06,648
No, no, no.

1548
01:25:16,074 --> 01:25:17,534
There's no point.

1549
01:25:17,701 --> 01:25:19,411
You'll never find your spark.

1550
01:25:20,120 --> 01:25:23,707
Because you have no purpose!

1551
01:25:31,048 --> 01:25:33,467
I'm not good. Nope.

1552
01:25:33,675 --> 01:25:36,887
Nothing. I just need to fill
out that last box. I give up.

1553
01:25:48,524 --> 01:25:49,566
You ready?

1554
01:25:49,650 --> 01:25:50,651
Huh?

1555
01:25:51,151 --> 01:25:52,444
To come live.

1556
01:25:54,988 --> 01:25:56,240
I'm scared, Joe.

1557
01:25:57,491 --> 01:25:58,784
I'm not good enough.

1558
01:25:59,868 --> 01:26:02,538
Anyway, I never got my spark.

1559
01:26:02,913 --> 01:26:04,206
Yes, you did.

1560
01:26:10,754 --> 01:26:13,215
Your spark isn't your purpose.

1561
01:26:13,382 --> 01:26:17,052
That last box fills in
when you're ready to come live.

1562
01:26:18,804 --> 01:26:20,013
And, the thing is

1563
01:26:21,098 --> 01:26:23,475
you're pretty great at jazzing.

1564
01:26:53,088 --> 01:26:54,089
But, Joe,

1565
01:26:54,798 --> 01:26:56,175
this means you won't get to...

1566
01:26:56,341 --> 01:26:59,219
It's okay. I already did.

1567
01:26:59,386 --> 01:27:01,138
Now it's your turn.

1568
01:27:07,394 --> 01:27:08,520
I'll go with you.

1569
01:27:09,021 --> 01:27:10,397
You know you can't do that.

1570
01:27:10,898 --> 01:27:13,817
I know.
But I'll go as far as I can.

1571
01:27:28,624 --> 01:27:30,626
Hey! Take a look!

1572
01:27:39,301 --> 01:27:40,552
Wow!

1573
01:28:53,208 --> 01:28:54,459
Mr Gardner?

1574
01:28:56,003 --> 01:28:57,004
Yes?

1575
01:28:57,087 --> 01:28:58,297
Do you have a moment?

1576
01:28:59,464 --> 01:29:02,968
I think I'm speaking for all the Jerrys
when I say thank you.

1577
01:29:03,385 --> 01:29:04,386
For what?

1578
01:29:04,553 --> 01:29:06,346
We're in the business of inspiration, Joe,

1579
01:29:06,430 --> 01:29:09,141
but it's not often
we find ourselves inspired.

1580
01:29:09,600 --> 01:29:11,101
Huh. Really?

1581
01:29:11,268 --> 01:29:14,813
So, we all decided to give you
another chance.

1582
01:29:19,526 --> 01:29:22,446
Hopefully, you will watch
where you walk from now on.

1583
01:29:23,155 --> 01:29:25,115
But what about Terry?

1584
01:29:25,282 --> 01:29:26,783
We worked it out with Terry.

1585
01:29:29,536 --> 01:29:30,704
Mm. That's weird.

1586
01:29:30,787 --> 01:29:31,914
Hey, Terry, what's that over there?

1587
01:29:31,997 --> 01:29:33,040
Look immediately.

1588
01:29:33,123 --> 01:29:34,124
What? What are you talking about?

1589
01:29:34,208 --> 01:29:36,168
- Oh, nothing. You were saying?
- Hmm?

1590
01:29:36,335 --> 01:29:38,086
Were you even talking?
I can't remember.

1591
01:29:38,253 --> 01:29:39,379
Never mind.

1592
01:29:40,964 --> 01:29:41,965
Well?

1593
01:29:48,472 --> 01:29:49,681
Thanks.

1594
01:29:49,806 --> 01:29:51,934
So what do you think you'll do?

1595
01:29:52,142 --> 01:29:53,685
How are you gonna spend your life?

1596
01:29:54,311 --> 01:29:55,896
I'm not sure.

1597
01:29:59,149 --> 01:30:00,692

1598
01:30:05,030 --> 01:30:07,824
