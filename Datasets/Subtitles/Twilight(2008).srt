1
00:00:21,576 --> 00:00:24,773
I'd never given much thought
to how I would die.

2
00:00:32,988 --> 00:00:35,914
But dying in the place
of someone I love...

3
00:00:35,919 --> 00:00:37,919
seems like a good way to go.

4
00:01:10,525 --> 00:01:12,598
So I can't bring myself to...

5
00:01:12,603 --> 00:01:15,033
regret the decision
to leave home.

6
00:01:16,431 --> 00:01:18,431
I would miss Phoenix.

7
00:01:20,635 --> 00:01:22,635
I'd miss the heat.

8
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,436
I would miss my
loving, erratic,

9
00:01:27,441 --> 00:01:28,572
harebrained mother.

10
00:01:28,577 --> 00:01:30,577
Okay.

11
00:01:31,179 --> 00:01:32,809
Renee, come on.
- And her new husband.

12
00:01:32,814 --> 00:01:34,369
Guys, come on.
I love you both.

13
00:01:34,374 --> 00:01:35,645
We got a plane to catch.

14
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:37,662
But they want to
go on the road,

15
00:01:37,667 --> 00:01:40,246
so I'm gonna spend
some time with my dad,

16
00:01:40,689 --> 00:01:42,953
and this will be a good thing.

17
00:01:44,393 --> 00:01:46,393
I think.

18
00:01:46,695 --> 00:01:49,630
When the thorn
bush turns white

19
00:01:49,698 --> 00:01:55,898
That's when I'll come home

20
00:01:55,971 --> 00:02:02,934
I am going out to
see what I can sow

21
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:09,642
And I don't know where I'll go

22
00:02:09,718 --> 00:02:13,017
And I don't know what I'll see

23
00:02:13,088 --> 00:02:14,551
In the state of Washington,

24
00:02:14,556 --> 00:02:17,525
under a near constant cover
of clouds and rain,

25
00:02:17,592 --> 00:02:19,992
there's a small
town named Forks.

26
00:02:20,061 --> 00:02:24,225
Population, 3, 120 people.

27
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,725
This is where I'm moving.

28
00:02:29,871 --> 00:02:31,871
My dad's Charlie.

29
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,535
He's the chief of police.

30
00:02:35,377 --> 00:02:39,108
Curse the powers that be

31
00:02:41,082 --> 00:02:43,949
Cause all I want is...

32
00:02:44,019 --> 00:02:46,019
Your hair's longer.

33
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:51,223
I cut it since the
last time I saw you.

34
00:02:54,463 --> 00:02:56,463
Guess it grew out again.

35
00:03:04,306 --> 00:03:07,833
I used to spend two weeks here
almost every summer,

36
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:10,510
but it's been years.

37
00:03:25,494 --> 00:03:27,457
I've cleared some shelves off
in the bathroom.

38
00:03:27,462 --> 00:03:29,623
Right. One bathroom.

39
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:38,102
It's a pretty good work lamp.

40
00:03:39,074 --> 00:03:41,975
The sales lady picked
out the bed stuff.

41
00:03:42,043 --> 00:03:44,568
You like purple, right?

42
00:03:44,646 --> 00:03:46,646
Purple's cool.

43
00:03:47,015 --> 00:03:49,015
Thanks.

44
00:03:54,723 --> 00:03:56,723
Okay.

45
00:04:01,029 --> 00:04:04,055
One of the best
things about Charlie,

46
00:04:04,132 --> 00:04:06,132
he doesn't hover.

47
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:15,437
Heard you guys coming
all the way down the road.

48
00:04:15,442 --> 00:04:17,442
Good to see you.

49
00:04:18,846 --> 00:04:21,294
Bella, you remember
Billy Black.

50
00:04:21,299 --> 00:04:21,744
Yeah.

51
00:04:21,749 --> 00:04:25,048
Wow, you're looking good.
- Well, I'm still dancing.

52
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:27,049
I'm glad you're finally here.

53
00:04:27,054 --> 00:04:28,878
Charlie here hasn't
shut up about it...

54
00:04:28,883 --> 00:04:30,519
since you told him
you were coming.

55
00:04:30,524 --> 00:04:33,425
All right, keep exaggerating.
I'll roll you into the mud.

56
00:04:33,494 --> 00:04:35,391
After I ram you in the ankles.

57
00:04:35,396 --> 00:04:37,059
You want to go?
- Yeah.

58
00:04:37,064 --> 00:04:38,360
Bring it.

59
00:04:38,365 --> 00:04:41,300
Hi, I'm Jacob.
- Hey.

60
00:04:41,368 --> 00:04:44,132
We used to make mud pies
when we were little.

61
00:04:44,204 --> 00:04:46,204
Right. No, I remember.

62
00:04:47,207 --> 00:04:49,266
Are they always like this?

63
00:04:49,877 --> 00:04:52,354
It's getting worse
with old age.

64
00:04:52,359 --> 00:04:52,808
Good.

65
00:04:52,813 --> 00:04:54,813
So, what do you think?

66
00:04:55,449 --> 00:04:57,246
Of what?

67
00:04:57,251 --> 00:04:59,685
Your homecoming present.
- This?

68
00:05:00,187 --> 00:05:03,054
Just bought it off Billy here.
- Yep.

69
00:05:03,123 --> 00:05:05,609
I totally rebuilt
the engine for you.

70
00:05:05,614 --> 00:05:06,221
Come on.

71
00:05:06,226 --> 00:05:08,226
Oh, my gosh.

72
00:05:08,963 --> 00:05:10,963
This is perfect.
Are you joking me?

73
00:05:11,832 --> 00:05:13,832
Sorry.

74
00:05:14,268 --> 00:05:16,231
I told you she'd love it.

75
00:05:16,236 --> 00:05:18,200
I'm down with the kids.

76
00:05:18,205 --> 00:05:20,696
Oh, yeah, dude.
You're the bomb.

77
00:05:20,774 --> 00:05:22,738
Okay.

78
00:05:22,743 --> 00:05:24,940
Listen, you gotta double-pump
the clutch when you shift,

79
00:05:24,945 --> 00:05:27,106
but besides that,
you should be good.

80
00:05:27,181 --> 00:05:29,411
That's this one?
- Yeah. Yeah, right there.

81
00:05:29,483 --> 00:05:31,483
All right.

82
00:05:31,819 --> 00:05:33,882
Do you want a ride to
school or something?

83
00:05:33,887 --> 00:05:35,912
I go to school on
the reservation.

84
00:05:36,223 --> 00:05:38,350
Right, right.
- Yeah.

85
00:05:38,425 --> 00:05:39,270
That's too bad.

86
00:05:39,275 --> 00:05:41,588
It would've been nice
to know one person.

87
00:05:48,068 --> 00:05:50,068
My first day at a new school.

88
00:05:50,137 --> 00:05:52,469
It's March, middle
of the semester.

89
00:05:53,707 --> 00:05:55,707
Great.

90
00:06:01,749 --> 00:06:04,309
Nice ride.
- Thanks.

91
00:06:05,886 --> 00:06:07,886
Good one.

92
00:06:13,961 --> 00:06:15,961
You're Isabella
Swan, the new girl.

93
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:19,397
Hi, I'm Eric, the eyes
and ears of this place.

94
00:06:20,434 --> 00:06:22,334
Anything you need, tour guide,

95
00:06:22,339 --> 00:06:24,339
lunch date,
shoulder to cry on?

96
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:31,811
I'm really kind of the more
suffer-in-silence type.

97
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:33,876
Good headline
for your feature.

98
00:06:33,881 --> 00:06:34,766
I'm on the paper,

99
00:06:34,771 --> 00:06:36,612
and you're news,
baby, front page.

100
00:06:36,617 --> 00:06:38,380
No, I'm not.

101
00:06:38,385 --> 00:06:38,988
You...

102
00:06:38,993 --> 00:06:42,219
Please don't have
any sort of...

103
00:06:42,289 --> 00:06:44,484
Chillax. No feature.

104
00:06:45,025 --> 00:06:46,555
Okay, thanks.
- Cool?

105
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,560
All right. Okay. Yeah.

106
00:06:52,666 --> 00:06:54,666
Get it. Get it. Get it.

107
00:06:55,636 --> 00:06:57,366
To you.

108
00:06:57,371 --> 00:06:58,801
Whoa.

109
00:06:58,806 --> 00:06:59,935
I'm sorry.

110
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:02,204
I told them not
to let me play.

111
00:07:02,609 --> 00:07:04,975
No way. No, no, no.
That's... That's... Don't...

112
00:07:05,045 --> 00:07:07,479
You're Isabella, right?

113
00:07:07,548 --> 00:07:09,078
Just Bella.

114
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:11,244
Yeah. Hey, I'm Mike Newton.

115
00:07:11,552 --> 00:07:13,679
Nice to meet you.
- Yeah, yeah.

116
00:07:13,754 --> 00:07:16,018
She's got a great spike, huh?
- Yeah, it's...

117
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:17,886
I'm Jessica, by the way.

118
00:07:17,891 --> 00:07:19,891
Hey, you're from
Arizona, right?

119
00:07:19,893 --> 00:07:21,290
Yeah.

120
00:07:21,295 --> 00:07:23,038
Aren't people from Arizona...

121
00:07:23,043 --> 00:07:25,043
supposed to be,
like, really tan?

122
00:07:25,099 --> 00:07:26,228
Yeah.

123
00:07:26,233 --> 00:07:28,827
Maybe that's why
they kicked me out.

124
00:07:32,339 --> 00:07:34,339
You're good.

125
00:07:35,042 --> 00:07:37,042
That's so funny.

126
00:07:40,547 --> 00:07:42,547
Back in, Jess.
- Down here.

127
00:07:43,016 --> 00:07:44,346
Like a masterpiece, you know,

128
00:07:44,351 --> 00:07:45,082
we'll have, like,

129
00:07:45,087 --> 00:07:46,682
this crazy pyramid
fall from the sky,

130
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:48,684
and then you guys can...
- It's my pleasure, Madame.

131
00:07:48,689 --> 00:07:50,176
You guys can give each
other high fives.

132
00:07:50,181 --> 00:07:50,886
Burrito, my friend?

133
00:07:50,891 --> 00:07:53,278
Hey, Mikey. You met
my home girl, Bella?

134
00:07:53,283 --> 00:07:53,722
Hey.

135
00:07:53,727 --> 00:07:54,990
Your home girl?

136
00:07:54,995 --> 00:07:56,058
Yeah.
- Yeah?

137
00:07:56,063 --> 00:07:58,063
That's...
- My girl.

138
00:07:58,298 --> 00:07:59,828
Sorry I had to mess
up your game, Mike.

139
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:01,833
Tyler.

140
00:08:02,002 --> 00:08:03,799
Yes.

141
00:08:03,804 --> 00:08:05,367
Oh, my God.

142
00:08:05,372 --> 00:08:07,793
It's like first
grade all over again.

143
00:08:07,798 --> 00:08:09,798
You're the shiny new toy.

144
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:11,473
Smile.

145
00:08:11,478 --> 00:08:12,808
Okay.
- Sorry.

146
00:08:12,813 --> 00:08:14,276
I needed a candid
for the feature.

147
00:08:14,281 --> 00:08:15,744
The feature's dead, Angela.

148
00:08:15,749 --> 00:08:17,808
Don't bring it up again.

149
00:08:18,118 --> 00:08:19,281
It's okay, I just...

150
00:08:19,286 --> 00:08:21,550
I got your back, baby.

151
00:08:21,622 --> 00:08:23,879
Guess we'll just run
another editorial...

152
00:08:23,884 --> 00:08:24,887
on teen drinking.

153
00:08:24,892 --> 00:08:25,670
You know,

154
00:08:25,675 --> 00:08:29,056
you can always go
for eating disorders.

155
00:08:30,597 --> 00:08:32,597
Speedo padding on
the swim team.

156
00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:34,229
Actually, that's a good one.

157
00:08:34,234 --> 00:08:37,003
Kirk. Right? That's
exactly what I thought.

158
00:08:37,008 --> 00:08:37,399
Yeah.

159
00:08:37,404 --> 00:08:39,565
We're talking Olympic-size.

160
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,903
There's no way.
He's so skinny.

161
00:08:40,908 --> 00:08:41,804
It doesn't make sense.

162
00:08:41,809 --> 00:08:43,809
Totally.
- Yeah.

163
00:08:46,013 --> 00:08:48,013
Who are they?

164
00:08:48,115 --> 00:08:50,115
The Cullens.

165
00:08:50,784 --> 00:08:54,276
They're Dr. and Mrs.
Cullen's foster kids.

166
00:08:54,354 --> 00:08:56,468
They moved down
here from Alaska,

167
00:08:56,473 --> 00:08:57,953
like, a few years ago.

168
00:08:57,958 --> 00:09:00,085
They kind of keep
to themselves.

169
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,160
Yeah, 'cause they're
all together.

170
00:09:02,162 --> 00:09:04,187
Like, together, together.

171
00:09:06,867 --> 00:09:09,427
The blonde girl,
that's Rosalie,

172
00:09:09,503 --> 00:09:11,694
and the big dark-haired
guy, Emmett,

173
00:09:11,699 --> 00:09:13,168
they're, like, a thing.

174
00:09:13,173 --> 00:09:14,703
I'm not even sure
that's legal.

175
00:09:14,708 --> 00:09:17,074
Jess, they're not
actually related.

176
00:09:17,144 --> 00:09:19,806
Yeah, but they live
together. It's weird.

177
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:23,509
And, okay, the little
dark-haired girl's Alice.

178
00:09:23,584 --> 00:09:25,547
She's really weird,

179
00:09:25,552 --> 00:09:27,973
and she's with Jasper,
the blond one...

180
00:09:27,978 --> 00:09:29,978
who looks like he's in pain.

181
00:09:33,794 --> 00:09:38,493
Dr. Cullen's like this
foster dad/matchmaker.

182
00:09:38,565 --> 00:09:40,565
Maybe he'll adopt me.

183
00:09:41,702 --> 00:09:43,702
Who's he?

184
00:09:49,443 --> 00:09:51,306
That's Edward Cullen.

185
00:09:51,311 --> 00:09:54,109
He's totally
gorgeous, obviously,

186
00:09:54,181 --> 00:09:57,514
but apparently nobody here's
good enough for him.

187
00:09:58,452 --> 00:10:00,818
Like I care, you know?

188
00:10:01,388 --> 00:10:03,388
So, yeah.

189
00:10:05,425 --> 00:10:08,258
Seriously, like,
don't waste your time.

190
00:10:08,328 --> 00:10:10,455
I wasn't planning on it.

191
00:10:20,507 --> 00:10:22,507
Mr. Molina.
- Hey, Mike.

192
00:10:23,644 --> 00:10:25,908
Oh, yes. Miss Swan.

193
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:42,826
Hi. Can I have the
pass? Thank you.

194
00:10:42,896 --> 00:10:45,294
Welcome to the class.
Here. Here's your stuff, okay?

195
00:10:45,299 --> 00:10:47,252
And I got a seat
for you right here,

196
00:10:47,257 --> 00:10:48,030
so come over.

197
00:10:48,035 --> 00:10:48,668
The last one.

198
00:10:48,673 --> 00:10:50,432
Just follow along
till you catch up.

199
00:10:50,437 --> 00:10:52,644
All right, guys, today
we are gonna be...

200
00:10:52,649 --> 00:10:54,603
observing the
behavior of planaria,

201
00:10:54,608 --> 00:10:56,667
aka flatworms.

202
00:10:57,511 --> 00:10:59,672
So what we're gonna do...

203
00:11:03,884 --> 00:11:05,884
...regenerate.

204
00:11:05,986 --> 00:11:07,986
Zombie worms.

205
00:11:08,388 --> 00:11:12,051
No cell phones. Guys,
let's get to it.

206
00:11:13,126 --> 00:11:14,957
Gentle, gentle, certain areas.

207
00:11:14,962 --> 00:11:18,728
Please just don't cut here.
We don't cut here.

208
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:20,799
You won't believe this.

209
00:11:21,268 --> 00:11:22,590
Let's try to focus...

210
00:11:22,595 --> 00:11:24,863
while we check those
out, huh, guys?

211
00:11:35,816 --> 00:11:37,212
There must be something open.

212
00:11:37,217 --> 00:11:40,152
Physics? Biochem?
- No, every class is full.

213
00:11:41,021 --> 00:11:42,651
Just a minute, dear.

214
00:11:42,656 --> 00:11:45,625
I'm afraid you'll have
to stay in biology.

215
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:50,195
Fine. Just... I'll just
have to endure it.

216
00:12:06,245 --> 00:12:09,012
I just can't get over
how grown up you are.

217
00:12:09,017 --> 00:12:10,611
And so gorgeous.

218
00:12:10,616 --> 00:12:12,641
Hey, Bella.

219
00:12:12,718 --> 00:12:14,718
You remember me?

220
00:12:15,588 --> 00:12:17,715
I played Santa one year.

221
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:19,268
Yeah, Waylon, she hasn't had...

222
00:12:19,273 --> 00:12:21,022
a Christmas here
since she was four.

223
00:12:21,027 --> 00:12:23,227
I bet I made an impression,
though, didn't I?

224
00:12:23,229 --> 00:12:25,754
You always do.
- Butt-crack Santa?

225
00:12:26,332 --> 00:12:28,396
Hey, kids love those
little bottles, though.

226
00:12:28,401 --> 00:12:29,008
All right,

227
00:12:29,013 --> 00:12:31,632
let the girl eat her
garden burger, Waylon.

228
00:12:31,704 --> 00:12:32,765
As soon as you're done,

229
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:34,201
I will bring you
your favorite.

230
00:12:34,206 --> 00:12:36,103
Berry cobbler, remember?

231
00:12:36,108 --> 00:12:39,043
Your dad still has
it. Every Thursday.

232
00:12:39,111 --> 00:12:41,238
Thank you. That'd be great.

233
00:12:45,918 --> 00:12:47,748
Here.

234
00:12:47,753 --> 00:12:49,753
Thanks.

235
00:12:57,930 --> 00:13:00,694
Hey, baby. So, listen,
if spring training goes well,

236
00:13:00,766 --> 00:13:01,996
we could be moving to Florida.

237
00:13:02,001 --> 00:13:03,259
Please insert $1.25...

238
00:13:03,264 --> 00:13:05,166
for an additional
three minutes.

239
00:13:05,171 --> 00:13:06,434
Mom, where's your cell?

240
00:13:06,439 --> 00:13:07,968
Okay, don't laugh.

241
00:13:07,973 --> 00:13:10,464
I didn't lose my power
cord. It ran away.

242
00:13:11,644 --> 00:13:14,875
Screaming. I literally
repel technology now.

243
00:13:15,581 --> 00:13:19,039
I miss you.
- Oh, baby, I miss you, too.

244
00:13:19,118 --> 00:13:20,429
But tell me more
about your school.

245
00:13:20,434 --> 00:13:21,482
Now, what are the kids like?

246
00:13:21,487 --> 00:13:23,546
Are there any cute guys?

247
00:13:23,622 --> 00:13:25,622
Are they being nice to you?

248
00:13:26,692 --> 00:13:28,692
Well,

249
00:13:29,295 --> 00:13:31,456
they're all very welcoming.

250
00:13:32,231 --> 00:13:33,761
Tell me all about it.

251
00:13:33,766 --> 00:13:35,529
It doesn't even matter.

252
00:13:35,534 --> 00:13:36,797
Yes, it does, honey.

253
00:13:36,802 --> 00:13:39,930
I have homework to do.
I'll talk to you later.

254
00:13:40,973 --> 00:13:42,436
Okay. I love you.

255
00:13:42,441 --> 00:13:44,441
Love you, too.

256
00:13:53,252 --> 00:13:54,992
I planned to confront him...

257
00:13:54,997 --> 00:13:57,484
and demand to know
what his problem was.

258
00:14:06,499 --> 00:14:08,499
But he never showed.

259
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,640
Bella.

260
00:14:29,622 --> 00:14:33,058
And the next day,
another no-show.

261
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:40,030
More days passed.

262
00:14:40,232 --> 00:14:43,030
Things were getting
a little strange.

263
00:15:32,751 --> 00:15:34,415
You all right?
- Yeah, I'm good.

264
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:37,253
Ice doesn't really help
the uncoordinated.

265
00:15:37,323 --> 00:15:38,927
Yeah. That's why I had...

266
00:15:38,932 --> 00:15:40,986
some new tires
put on the truck.

267
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:43,824
Old ones were
getting pretty bald.

268
00:15:43,896 --> 00:15:45,426
Well, probably be
late for dinner.

269
00:15:45,431 --> 00:15:46,961
I gotta head down
to Mason County.

270
00:15:46,966 --> 00:15:49,187
Security guard at
the Grisham Mill...

271
00:15:49,192 --> 00:15:51,232
got killed by some
kind of animal.

272
00:15:51,971 --> 00:15:53,971
An animal?

273
00:15:54,707 --> 00:15:57,301
You're not in Phoenix
anymore, Bells.

274
00:15:57,376 --> 00:15:59,469
Anyway, I figured
I'd lend a hand.

275
00:15:59,545 --> 00:16:01,809
Be careful.
- Always am.

276
00:16:03,315 --> 00:16:05,806
And thanks for the tires.
- Yeah.

277
00:16:22,501 --> 00:16:23,998
Prom Committee is
a chick thing,

278
00:16:24,003 --> 00:16:25,966
but I gotta cover it
for the paper anyway,

279
00:16:25,971 --> 00:16:27,801
and they need a guy
to help choose the music,

280
00:16:27,806 --> 00:16:28,902
so I need your play list.

281
00:16:28,907 --> 00:16:33,435
Hey, listen, I was wondering,
did you have a date to...

282
00:16:33,512 --> 00:16:35,309
What's up, Arizona? Huh?

283
00:16:35,314 --> 00:16:37,314
How you liking the rain, girl?

284
00:16:37,316 --> 00:16:38,479
Better get used to it, girl.

285
00:16:38,484 --> 00:16:40,314
Yeah, Mike, hey,
you're real cute, man.

286
00:16:40,319 --> 00:16:43,482
Oh, I know...
- That was really awesome.

287
00:16:43,555 --> 00:16:45,905
Why you shooting down my game?
Let a playa play.

288
00:16:45,924 --> 00:16:48,654
Yeah, okay.
What you playing at, T-Ball?

289
00:16:58,504 --> 00:17:00,467
Hello.

290
00:17:00,472 --> 00:17:02,656
I'm sorry, I didn't
get a chance...

291
00:17:02,661 --> 00:17:04,605
to introduce myself last week.

292
00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:06,610
I'm Edward Cullen.

293
00:17:06,612 --> 00:17:08,612
You're Bella?

294
00:17:09,214 --> 00:17:10,377
Yes.

295
00:17:10,382 --> 00:17:12,179
Onion root tip cells,

296
00:17:12,184 --> 00:17:13,981
that's what's on your
slides right now.

297
00:17:13,986 --> 00:17:16,382
Okay? So, separate
and label them...

298
00:17:16,387 --> 00:17:18,252
into the phases of mitosis,

299
00:17:18,257 --> 00:17:21,137
and the first partners
that get it right...

300
00:17:21,142 --> 00:17:23,217
are gonna win
the Golden Onion.

301
00:17:26,265 --> 00:17:28,265
All right, good.

302
00:17:29,101 --> 00:17:31,101
Ladies first.

303
00:17:35,607 --> 00:17:37,571
You were gone.

304
00:17:37,576 --> 00:17:39,206
Yeah.

305
00:17:39,211 --> 00:17:41,702
I was out of town
for a couple of days.

306
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:43,780
Personal reasons.

307
00:17:44,516 --> 00:17:46,516
Prophase.

308
00:17:47,286 --> 00:17:49,286
Do you mind if I look?

309
00:17:54,393 --> 00:17:56,393
It's prophase.

310
00:17:56,895 --> 00:17:58,895
Like I said.

311
00:18:04,036 --> 00:18:06,300
So are you enjoying the rain?

312
00:18:09,141 --> 00:18:10,504
What?

313
00:18:10,509 --> 00:18:12,807
You're asking me
about the weather?

314
00:18:12,878 --> 00:18:14,878
Yeah, I...

315
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,880
I guess I am.

316
00:18:18,784 --> 00:18:21,719
Well, I don't really
like the rain.

317
00:18:23,655 --> 00:18:27,113
Any cold, wet thing,
I don't really...

318
00:18:31,797 --> 00:18:33,890
What?
- Nothing.

319
00:18:38,837 --> 00:18:40,837
It's anaphase.

320
00:18:41,173 --> 00:18:43,471
You mind if I check?
- Sure.

321
00:18:52,084 --> 00:18:53,914
Anaphase.

322
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:55,919
Like I said.

323
00:18:59,591 --> 00:19:01,488
If you hate the cold
and the rain so much,

324
00:19:01,493 --> 00:19:04,085
why'd you move to
the wettest place...

325
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:06,090
in the continental US?

326
00:19:11,303 --> 00:19:13,303
It's complicated.

327
00:19:13,739 --> 00:19:15,739
I'm sure I can keep up.

328
00:19:20,245 --> 00:19:22,405
My mom remarried, and...

329
00:19:23,848 --> 00:19:26,646
So you don't like
the guy, or...

330
00:19:27,185 --> 00:19:29,185
No, that's not...

331
00:19:31,589 --> 00:19:33,589
Phil's really nice.

332
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:49,168
It's metaphase. You
want to check it?

333
00:19:50,575 --> 00:19:52,575
I believe you.

334
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:56,138
Why didn't you move
with your mother and Phil?

335
00:19:58,049 --> 00:20:01,951
Well, Phil's a minor
league baseball player,

336
00:20:02,019 --> 00:20:04,920
and he travels a lot,

337
00:20:04,989 --> 00:20:06,687
and my mom stayed
home with me,

338
00:20:06,692 --> 00:20:08,454
but I knew it
made her unhappy,

339
00:20:08,459 --> 00:20:12,953
so I figured I'd stay
with my dad for a while.

340
00:20:14,932 --> 00:20:17,059
And now you're unhappy.

341
00:20:17,702 --> 00:20:19,863
No.
- I'm sorry, I'm just...

342
00:20:20,905 --> 00:20:23,669
I'm just trying to
figure you out.

343
00:20:23,741 --> 00:20:26,175
You're very difficult
for me to read.

344
00:20:26,244 --> 00:20:28,474
Hey, did you get contacts?

345
00:20:28,546 --> 00:20:30,546
No.

346
00:20:30,915 --> 00:20:33,179
Your eyes were black
the last time I saw you,

347
00:20:33,251 --> 00:20:37,210
and now they're,
like, golden brown.

348
00:20:37,288 --> 00:20:39,449
Yeah, I know, it's the...

349
00:20:39,857 --> 00:20:41,882
It's the fluorescents.

350
00:21:37,281 --> 00:21:39,281
Bella.
- Bella.

351
00:21:40,117 --> 00:21:41,180
Dial 911.

352
00:21:41,185 --> 00:21:41,810
I already called.

353
00:21:41,815 --> 00:21:43,215
They're gonna send
somebody over soon.

354
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:45,745
Bella, I'm so
sorry. I panicked.

355
00:21:46,857 --> 00:21:49,655
Bella, I've got 911
on the phone now.

356
00:21:55,866 --> 00:21:57,866
Bella. You okay?

357
00:21:58,669 --> 00:22:00,132
You and I are gonna
talk. You all right?

358
00:22:00,137 --> 00:22:02,001
I'm fine, Dad. Calm down.

359
00:22:02,006 --> 00:22:04,440
I'm sorry, Bella.
I tried to stop.

360
00:22:04,508 --> 00:22:05,638
I know. It's okay.

361
00:22:05,643 --> 00:22:08,077
No. It sure as
hell is not okay.

362
00:22:08,446 --> 00:22:09,642
Dad, it wasn't his fault.

363
00:22:09,647 --> 00:22:11,777
You could've been killed.
You understand that?

364
00:22:11,782 --> 00:22:13,943
Yes. But I wasn't, so...

365
00:22:15,019 --> 00:22:17,715
You can kiss your
license goodbye.

366
00:22:17,788 --> 00:22:19,824
I heard the chief's
daughter was here.

367
00:22:19,829 --> 00:22:20,486
Dr. Cullen.

368
00:22:20,491 --> 00:22:22,221
Charlie.

369
00:22:22,226 --> 00:22:24,319
I've got this one, Jackie.

370
00:22:25,429 --> 00:22:27,429
Isabella.

371
00:22:27,531 --> 00:22:28,928
Bella.

372
00:22:28,933 --> 00:22:31,167
Well, Bella, looks like
you took quite a spill.

373
00:22:31,172 --> 00:22:31,931
How do you feel?

374
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:33,866
Good.

375
00:22:33,871 --> 00:22:35,871
Look here.

376
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,896
You might experience some...

377
00:22:37,901 --> 00:22:40,267
post-traumatic stress
or disorientation,

378
00:22:40,344 --> 00:22:42,308
but your vitals look good.

379
00:22:42,313 --> 00:22:44,406
No signs of any head trauma.

380
00:22:44,482 --> 00:22:46,078
I think you'll be just fine.

381
00:22:46,083 --> 00:22:48,551
I'm so sorry, Bella.
I'm really...

382
00:22:51,822 --> 00:22:52,047
You know,

383
00:22:52,052 --> 00:22:52,985
it would've been a
whole lot worse...

384
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:55,857
if Edward wasn't there.
He knocked me out of the way.

385
00:22:55,926 --> 00:22:58,019
Edward? Your boy?

386
00:22:58,629 --> 00:23:00,059
Yeah, it was amazing.

387
00:23:00,064 --> 00:23:02,828
I mean, he got to me so fast.
He was nowhere near me.

388
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,993
Sounds like you
were very lucky.

389
00:23:05,069 --> 00:23:07,069
Charlie.

390
00:23:10,441 --> 00:23:12,667
I gotta go sign
some paperwork.

391
00:23:12,672 --> 00:23:14,306
You should...

392
00:23:14,311 --> 00:23:16,745
You should probably
call your mom.

393
00:23:16,814 --> 00:23:18,814
Did you tell her?

394
00:23:21,285 --> 00:23:23,285
She's probably just...

395
00:23:24,355 --> 00:23:26,355
freaking out.

396
00:23:27,224 --> 00:23:28,688
fifteen kids that saw
what happened.

397
00:23:28,693 --> 00:23:30,552
What was I supposed
to do, then?

398
00:23:30,557 --> 00:23:31,323
Let her die?

399
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:34,024
This isn't just about you.
It's about all of us.

400
00:23:34,098 --> 00:23:36,896
I think we should
take this in my office.

401
00:23:38,936 --> 00:23:41,293
Can I talk to
you for a minute?

402
00:23:41,298 --> 00:23:43,298
Rosalie.

403
00:23:48,012 --> 00:23:50,012
What?

404
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:55,116
How did you get
over to me so fast?

405
00:23:55,186 --> 00:23:57,654
I was standing right
next to you, Bella.

406
00:23:57,722 --> 00:24:01,522
No. You were next to your car,
across the lot.

407
00:24:02,126 --> 00:24:04,126
No, I wasn't.

408
00:24:06,163 --> 00:24:08,163
Yes, you were.

409
00:24:09,433 --> 00:24:12,800
Bella, you're...
You hit your head.

410
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:14,700
I think you're confused.

411
00:24:14,705 --> 00:24:16,202
I know what I saw.

412
00:24:16,207 --> 00:24:18,334
And what exactly was that?

413
00:24:19,176 --> 00:24:21,176
You...

414
00:24:22,279 --> 00:24:24,279
You stopped the van.

415
00:24:24,782 --> 00:24:27,478
You pushed it away
with your hand.

416
00:24:28,419 --> 00:24:31,149
Well, nobody's gonna
believe you, so...

417
00:24:32,423 --> 00:24:34,618
I wasn't gonna tell anybody.

418
00:24:35,326 --> 00:24:37,726
I just need to know the truth.

419
00:24:38,763 --> 00:24:41,561
Can't you just thank
me and get over it?

420
00:24:41,966 --> 00:24:43,966
Thank you.

421
00:24:44,935 --> 00:24:47,463
You're not gonna let
this go, are you?

422
00:24:47,468 --> 00:24:47,733
No.

423
00:24:47,738 --> 00:24:50,707
Well, then I hope you
enjoy disappointment.

424
00:25:25,309 --> 00:25:28,801
And that was the first night
I dreamt of Edward Cullen.

425
00:25:31,248 --> 00:25:32,945
I need everybody's
permission slips, okay?

426
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:34,747
Sammy, please collect them.
- Yeah.

427
00:25:34,752 --> 00:25:36,549
Guys, let's go.

428
00:25:36,554 --> 00:25:39,489
Come on, get in. In. Let's go.

429
00:25:51,602 --> 00:25:54,332
Look at you, huh?
You're alive.

430
00:25:54,939 --> 00:25:57,584
I know, yeah. False
alarm, I guess.

431
00:25:57,589 --> 00:25:58,437
Yeah.

432
00:25:58,442 --> 00:26:01,809
Now, I wanted to ask you,
you know, if, you know,

433
00:26:01,879 --> 00:26:03,879
it's like a month away, but...

434
00:26:05,049 --> 00:26:08,712
Do you wanna go
to prom with me?

435
00:26:11,722 --> 00:26:13,849
So, what do you think?

436
00:26:14,425 --> 00:26:16,859
About what?
- Do you want to go?

437
00:26:18,863 --> 00:26:20,359
To prom?

438
00:26:20,364 --> 00:26:22,364
With me?

439
00:26:23,634 --> 00:26:25,497
I...

440
00:26:25,502 --> 00:26:27,502
Prom.

441
00:26:27,638 --> 00:26:29,602
Dancing.

442
00:26:29,607 --> 00:26:31,802
Not such a good idea for me.

443
00:26:33,544 --> 00:26:35,876
I have something
that weekend anyway.

444
00:26:35,946 --> 00:26:37,946
I'm going to Jacksonville
that weekend.

445
00:26:37,948 --> 00:26:39,948
You can't go another weekend?

446
00:26:39,984 --> 00:26:41,984
Non-refundable ticket.

447
00:26:42,686 --> 00:26:44,745
You should ask Jessica.

448
00:26:44,822 --> 00:26:46,822
I know she wants
to go with you.

449
00:26:46,857 --> 00:26:48,857
All right. All right.

450
00:26:49,827 --> 00:26:52,261
Yo, yo, yo. Hey,
guys, come on.

451
00:26:52,329 --> 00:26:55,457
We gotta go. We gotta go.
Green is what? Good.

452
00:26:55,532 --> 00:26:57,897
Let's go. Guys, come on.

453
00:26:59,469 --> 00:27:01,199
Other bus, other
bus. Let's go.

454
00:27:01,204 --> 00:27:02,834
Egg shells, carrot tops.

455
00:27:02,839 --> 00:27:03,731
Compost is cool.

456
00:27:03,736 --> 00:27:05,536
Now, stuff that
in there, Eric.

457
00:27:05,541 --> 00:27:07,105
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
- Very good, very good.

458
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:10,958
Now, I am gonna make
a steaming cup...

459
00:27:10,963 --> 00:27:12,810
of compost tea.

460
00:27:12,815 --> 00:27:13,978
Okay.
- Give me that.

461
00:27:13,983 --> 00:27:17,885
Yeah. This is recycling
in its most basic form, guys.

462
00:27:17,954 --> 00:27:20,582
Don't drink it. It's
for the plants.

463
00:27:21,257 --> 00:27:23,384
What's in Jacksonville?

464
00:27:25,295 --> 00:27:27,456
How did you know about that?

465
00:27:28,564 --> 00:27:30,794
You didn't answer my question.

466
00:27:31,034 --> 00:27:33,798
You don't answer
any of mine, so...

467
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:36,498
I mean, you don't
even say hi to me.

468
00:27:36,906 --> 00:27:38,906
Hi.

469
00:27:39,809 --> 00:27:42,403
Are you gonna tell me
how you stopped the van?

470
00:27:42,478 --> 00:27:45,379
Yeah. I had an
adrenaline rush.

471
00:27:45,949 --> 00:27:48,509
It's very common.
You can Google it.

472
00:27:52,455 --> 00:27:54,218
Floridians.

473
00:27:54,223 --> 00:27:56,521
That's what's in Jacksonville.

474
00:27:57,093 --> 00:27:59,857
Can you at least
watch where you walk?

475
00:28:02,865 --> 00:28:05,072
Look, I'm sorry I'm
being rude all the time.

476
00:28:05,077 --> 00:28:06,698
I just think it's
the best way.

477
00:28:06,703 --> 00:28:09,467
Bella. Guess who just
asked me to prom.

478
00:28:09,973 --> 00:28:11,769
Who?

479
00:28:11,774 --> 00:28:14,546
Yeah, I actually
totally thought...

480
00:28:14,551 --> 00:28:16,768
that Mike was gonna ask you.

481
00:28:16,846 --> 00:28:18,970
It's not gonna be
weird, though, right?

482
00:28:18,975 --> 00:28:20,078
No. Zero weirdness.

483
00:28:20,083 --> 00:28:22,283
You guys are great together.
- I know, right?

484
00:28:23,086 --> 00:28:25,049
Tyler...
- Gross.

485
00:28:25,054 --> 00:28:27,147
Bella, look. It's a worm.

486
00:28:27,223 --> 00:28:29,223
It's a worm.

487
00:28:32,695 --> 00:28:35,129
Bella, we shouldn't
be friends.

488
00:28:37,834 --> 00:28:41,429
You really should've figured
that out a little earlier.

489
00:28:41,971 --> 00:28:43,634
I mean, why didn't you just
let the van crush me...

490
00:28:43,639 --> 00:28:46,107
and save yourself
all this regret?

491
00:28:48,211 --> 00:28:50,108
What, you think I
regret saving you?

492
00:28:50,113 --> 00:28:53,571
I can see that you do.
I just... I don't know why.

493
00:28:54,584 --> 00:28:56,677
You don't know anything.

494
00:28:57,253 --> 00:28:58,950
Hi.

495
00:28:58,955 --> 00:29:00,184
Are you gonna be
riding with us?

496
00:29:00,189 --> 00:29:02,189
No, our bus is full.

497
00:29:12,201 --> 00:29:14,201
Your mom called. Again.

498
00:29:16,172 --> 00:29:17,235
Well, that's your fault.

499
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,361
You shouldn't have told her...

500
00:29:18,366 --> 00:29:19,937
about the 'almost'
accident. You finished?

501
00:29:19,942 --> 00:29:21,906
Yeah.

502
00:29:21,911 --> 00:29:23,792
Yeah, I suppose you're right.

503
00:29:23,797 --> 00:29:25,938
She always did
know how to worry.

504
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:29,350
She seems different.

505
00:29:30,119 --> 00:29:32,119
She seems happy.

506
00:29:35,124 --> 00:29:37,615
Phil sounds like
an all right guy.

507
00:29:39,195 --> 00:29:41,195
Yeah, he is.

508
00:29:47,537 --> 00:29:48,666
All right.

509
00:29:48,671 --> 00:29:51,299
No, you need the mitts.
You need them.

510
00:29:51,874 --> 00:29:53,484
No, why do you keep
arguing with me?

511
00:29:53,489 --> 00:29:54,338
You just need them.

512
00:29:54,343 --> 00:29:57,437
You're gonna get frostbite.
- I don't even know.

513
00:30:00,683 --> 00:30:02,313
Yeah. Hey.

514
00:30:02,318 --> 00:30:03,485
La Push, baby. You in?

515
00:30:03,490 --> 00:30:05,149
Should I know what that means?

516
00:30:05,154 --> 00:30:06,735
La Push Beach down
at the Quileute Rez.

517
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:07,752
We're all going tomorrow.

518
00:30:07,757 --> 00:30:09,410
Yeah, there's a big
swell coming in.

519
00:30:09,415 --> 00:30:11,022
And I don't just
surf the Internet.

520
00:30:11,027 --> 00:30:13,357
Eric, you stood up once,
and it was a foam board.

521
00:30:13,362 --> 00:30:15,042
But there's whale
watching, too.

522
00:30:15,047 --> 00:30:15,793
Come with us.

523
00:30:15,798 --> 00:30:18,858
La Push, baby. It's La Push.

524
00:30:19,335 --> 00:30:21,399
Okay, I'll go if you
stop saying that, okay?

525
00:30:21,404 --> 00:30:23,034
Seriously, dude.
It's creepy, man.

526
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:24,502
What? That's what it's called.
- So...

527
00:30:24,507 --> 00:30:26,507
Edible art?

528
00:30:29,278 --> 00:30:31,278
Bella.

529
00:30:31,781 --> 00:30:33,177
Thanks.

530
00:30:33,182 --> 00:30:35,016
You know, your mood swings...

531
00:30:35,021 --> 00:30:37,021
are kind of giving
me whiplash.

532
00:30:38,588 --> 00:30:40,218
I only said it'd be better
if we weren't friends,

533
00:30:40,223 --> 00:30:41,719
not that I didn't wanna be.

534
00:30:41,724 --> 00:30:43,724
What does that mean?

535
00:30:44,093 --> 00:30:47,494
It means if you were smart,
you'd stay away from me.

536
00:30:48,498 --> 00:30:50,705
Okay, well, let's say
for argument's sake...

537
00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:51,729
that I'm not smart.

538
00:30:51,734 --> 00:30:54,931
Would you tell me the truth?
- No, probably not.

539
00:30:56,038 --> 00:30:58,404
I'd rather hear your theories.

540
00:30:59,642 --> 00:31:01,642
I have considered...

541
00:31:02,879 --> 00:31:05,712
radioactive spiders
and Kryptonite.

542
00:31:07,483 --> 00:31:09,849
That's all superhero
stuff, right?

543
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:13,320
What if I'm not the hero?
What if I'm the bad guy?

544
00:31:14,090 --> 00:31:16,090
You're not.

545
00:31:16,459 --> 00:31:18,459
I can see what you're
trying to put off,

546
00:31:18,461 --> 00:31:20,825
but I can see that it's just
to keep people away from you.

547
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:22,830
It's a mask.

548
00:31:26,402 --> 00:31:30,099
Why don't we just hang out?

549
00:31:32,241 --> 00:31:34,105
Everybody's going
to the beach.

550
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:36,110
Come.

551
00:31:36,712 --> 00:31:40,170
I mean, have fun.

552
00:31:43,019 --> 00:31:45,044
Which beach?
- La Push.

553
00:31:45,855 --> 00:31:47,752
I don't know.

554
00:31:47,757 --> 00:31:49,554
I just...

555
00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:52,460
Is there something
wrong with that beach?

556
00:31:54,997 --> 00:31:57,090
It's just a little crowded.

557
00:32:02,405 --> 00:32:05,533
Hey, it's freezing.
- I'm paddling out, Coates.

558
00:32:05,841 --> 00:32:07,328
I don't know if it's
worth it anymore.

559
00:32:07,333 --> 00:32:08,506
We drove all the way out here.

560
00:32:08,511 --> 00:32:10,408
I'm at least paddling out.
- Yeah.

561
00:32:10,413 --> 00:32:12,009
She's right.
- You guys are babies.

562
00:32:12,014 --> 00:32:14,083
So, I keep thinking
that Eric's...

563
00:32:14,088 --> 00:32:15,680
gonna ask me to the prom,

564
00:32:15,685 --> 00:32:18,176
and then he just doesn't.

565
00:32:20,823 --> 00:32:22,823
You should ask him.

566
00:32:23,793 --> 00:32:24,656
Take control.

567
00:32:24,661 --> 00:32:26,990
You're a strong,
independent woman.

568
00:32:27,697 --> 00:32:29,697
I am?
- Yes.

569
00:32:30,833 --> 00:32:33,131
Hey, will you do me up?
- Yeah.

570
00:32:34,770 --> 00:32:36,965
Bella.
- Hi, Jacob.

571
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:38,703
Guys, this is Jacob.
- Hey, guys. How you doing?

572
00:32:38,708 --> 00:32:40,708
Hi.
- Hi.

573
00:32:41,978 --> 00:32:44,003
What are you,
like, stalking me?

574
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,173
You're on my rez, remember?

575
00:32:47,049 --> 00:32:49,049
Are you surfing?

576
00:32:49,051 --> 00:32:50,982
Definitely not.
- Thanks.

577
00:32:50,987 --> 00:32:52,975
You guys should
keep Bella company.

578
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:53,951
Her date bailed.

579
00:32:53,956 --> 00:32:55,086
What date?

580
00:32:55,091 --> 00:32:56,988
She invited Edward.

581
00:32:56,993 --> 00:32:58,065
To be polite, that's it.

582
00:32:58,070 --> 00:32:59,590
I think it's nice
she invited him.

583
00:32:59,595 --> 00:33:00,506
Nobody ever does.

584
00:33:00,511 --> 00:33:02,193
Yeah, 'cause Cullen's a freak.

585
00:33:02,198 --> 00:33:04,198
You got that right.

586
00:33:04,634 --> 00:33:06,330
You guys know him?

587
00:33:06,335 --> 00:33:08,599
The Cullens don't come here.

588
00:33:16,746 --> 00:33:18,868
What did your
friends mean about,

589
00:33:18,873 --> 00:33:21,445
you know, 'The Cullens
don't come here?'

590
00:33:21,517 --> 00:33:23,542
You caught that, huh?

591
00:33:24,854 --> 00:33:28,119
I'm not really supposed
to say anything about it.

592
00:33:28,924 --> 00:33:31,017
Hey, I can keep a secret.

593
00:33:33,062 --> 00:33:36,031
Really, it's just like
an old scary story.

594
00:33:38,501 --> 00:33:40,526
Well, I want to know.

595
00:33:43,372 --> 00:33:45,330
Okay, did you know Quileutes...

596
00:33:45,335 --> 00:33:47,672
are supposedly
descended from wolves?

597
00:33:48,577 --> 00:33:50,977
What? Like, wolves?

598
00:33:51,047 --> 00:33:53,047
Yeah.
- Like, real wolves?

599
00:33:53,082 --> 00:33:56,449
Well, that's the
legend of our tribe.

600
00:33:56,652 --> 00:33:57,748
Okay.

601
00:33:57,753 --> 00:34:00,517
So what's the story
about the Cullens?

602
00:34:01,924 --> 00:34:04,538
Well, they're
supposedly descended...

603
00:34:04,543 --> 00:34:06,543
from this, like, enemy clan.

604
00:34:09,799 --> 00:34:11,842
My great grandfather,
the chief,

605
00:34:11,847 --> 00:34:13,847
found them hunting
on our land.

606
00:34:14,837 --> 00:34:16,901
But they claimed to be
something different,

607
00:34:16,906 --> 00:34:19,170
so we made a treaty with them.

608
00:34:19,675 --> 00:34:22,269
If they promised to stay
off Quileute lands,

609
00:34:22,345 --> 00:34:23,995
then we wouldn't expose...

610
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,475
what they really were
to the palefaces.

611
00:34:27,883 --> 00:34:30,373
I thought they
just moved here.

612
00:34:30,919 --> 00:34:32,919
Or just moved back.

613
00:34:33,621 --> 00:34:35,518
Right.

614
00:34:35,523 --> 00:34:38,253
It touched my hand.
A snake. Stop.

615
00:34:40,228 --> 00:34:42,594
Well, what are they really?

616
00:34:42,664 --> 00:34:44,757
It's just a story, Bella.

617
00:34:45,834 --> 00:34:47,834
Come on, let's go.

618
00:34:50,905 --> 00:34:53,430
A snake. A snake.

619
00:34:57,545 --> 00:35:03,643
My mama said I didn't know
how to make a kitty meow

620
00:35:10,859 --> 00:35:12,859
Hello?

621
00:35:19,134 --> 00:35:21,134
Gerald?

622
00:35:21,636 --> 00:35:23,636
Gerald?

623
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:44,390
Hello.

624
00:35:44,492 --> 00:35:46,492
Nice jacket.

625
00:35:49,097 --> 00:35:50,293
Who are you?

626
00:35:50,298 --> 00:35:53,199
It's always the same
inane questions.

627
00:35:53,268 --> 00:35:54,531
'Who are you?'

628
00:35:54,536 --> 00:35:56,536
'What do you want?'

629
00:35:56,838 --> 00:35:58,897
'Why are you doing this?'

630
00:35:58,973 --> 00:36:02,636
James, let's not
play with our food.

631
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:54,060
He's not here.

632
00:36:55,864 --> 00:36:59,129
Whenever the weather's nice,
the Cullens disappear.

633
00:36:59,701 --> 00:37:01,464
What, do they just ditch?

634
00:37:01,469 --> 00:37:03,816
No, Dr. and Mrs. Cullen
yank them out...

635
00:37:03,821 --> 00:37:06,168
for, like, hiking and
camping and stuff.

636
00:37:06,241 --> 00:37:07,764
I tried that out
on my parents.

637
00:37:07,769 --> 00:37:08,505
Not even close.

638
00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:11,308
Guys, I'm going to
the prom with Eric.

639
00:37:11,379 --> 00:37:13,344
I just asked him.
I took control.

640
00:37:13,349 --> 00:37:15,144
I told you that would happen.

641
00:37:15,149 --> 00:37:17,617
Are you sure you have
to go out of town?

642
00:37:17,685 --> 00:37:20,245
Oh, yeah, it's a
little family thing.

643
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:21,751
Okay, we should go shopping
in Port Angeles...

644
00:37:21,756 --> 00:37:24,691
before all the good
dresses get cleaned out.

645
00:37:27,529 --> 00:37:30,396
Port Angeles? You
mind if I come?

646
00:37:30,465 --> 00:37:32,797
Yeah, I need your opinion.

647
00:37:34,469 --> 00:37:36,132
I like this one.
- That's cool.

648
00:37:36,137 --> 00:37:38,535
But, like, I don't know about
the one-shoulder thing.

649
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:40,069
I like this one.
- Yeah, I like the beading,

650
00:37:40,074 --> 00:37:41,180
and you wouldn't need jewelry.

651
00:37:41,185 --> 00:37:42,438
Jess, what do you
think? Lavender?

652
00:37:42,443 --> 00:37:43,925
Is that good? Is
that my color?

653
00:37:43,930 --> 00:37:44,407
I like it.

654
00:37:44,412 --> 00:37:46,412
I liked that dusty
rose one, too.

655
00:37:46,481 --> 00:37:49,450
Okay, I like this one.
It makes my boobs look good.

656
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:50,747
Hey.
- Right?

657
00:37:50,752 --> 00:37:52,582
Nice.

658
00:37:52,587 --> 00:37:55,283
Oh, God.
- That is uncomfortable.

659
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:57,554
That's disgusting.

660
00:37:57,559 --> 00:37:59,455
Bella, what do you think?

661
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:01,090
Yes?

662
00:38:01,095 --> 00:38:02,959
That looks great.

663
00:38:02,964 --> 00:38:05,933
You said that about, like,
the last five dresses, though.

664
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,230
I thought they were
all pretty good.

665
00:38:08,303 --> 00:38:10,828
You're not really
into this, are you?

666
00:38:10,905 --> 00:38:14,204
I actually really just want
to go to this bookstore.

667
00:38:14,576 --> 00:38:16,139
I'll meet you guys
at the restaurant?

668
00:38:16,144 --> 00:38:16,851
Are you sure?

669
00:38:16,856 --> 00:38:18,874
Yeah, yeah. I'll
see you in a minute.

670
00:38:18,947 --> 00:38:20,947
Okay.
- Okay.

671
00:38:22,617 --> 00:38:24,617
She's right, though.
This looks awesome.

672
00:38:27,522 --> 00:38:29,522
There you go.

673
00:38:30,692 --> 00:38:32,922
Have a good night.
- Thank you.

674
00:39:05,026 --> 00:39:08,792
Saw you in the dress store.
- Hey, where you running to?

675
00:39:08,863 --> 00:39:10,093
There she is.

676
00:39:10,098 --> 00:39:12,028
What's up?
- It's my girl.

677
00:39:12,033 --> 00:39:13,763
How you guys doing?
- Look who we just found.

678
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:16,635
What's up, girl? Hey...
Where you going?

679
00:39:16,704 --> 00:39:18,835
Where are you going?
- Come get a drink with us.

680
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:19,968
Yeah, you should
hang out with us.

681
00:39:19,973 --> 00:39:20,236
Come on.

682
00:39:20,241 --> 00:39:21,638
It's fun.

683
00:39:21,643 --> 00:39:23,106
What's the problem?
- She doesn't like that, man.

684
00:39:23,111 --> 00:39:24,574
You're pretty.
- Don't touch me.

685
00:39:24,579 --> 00:39:24,828
Cute.

686
00:39:24,833 --> 00:39:26,542
Really, no. Seriously,
you should.

687
00:39:26,547 --> 00:39:28,547
Don't touch me.

688
00:39:36,024 --> 00:39:38,024
Get in the car.

689
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:41,922
That was a very
dangerous maneuver.

690
00:40:08,790 --> 00:40:11,390
I should go back there
and rip those guys' heads off.

691
00:40:11,426 --> 00:40:12,522
No, you shouldn't.

692
00:40:12,527 --> 00:40:14,572
You don't know the vile,
repulsive things...

693
00:40:14,577 --> 00:40:15,458
they were thinking.

694
00:40:15,463 --> 00:40:17,463
And you do?

695
00:40:17,632 --> 00:40:19,657
It's not hard to guess.

696
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:22,985
Can you talk about
something else?

697
00:40:22,990 --> 00:40:25,204
Distract me so I
won't turn around.

698
00:40:26,474 --> 00:40:28,806
You should put
your seatbelt on.

699
00:40:30,178 --> 00:40:32,544
You should put
your seatbelt on.

700
00:40:37,585 --> 00:40:38,917
I thought the salad
was pretty good.

701
00:40:38,922 --> 00:40:40,216
Hey, you guys, I'm
sorry. I just...

702
00:40:40,221 --> 00:40:41,818
Where were you? We
left you messages.

703
00:40:41,823 --> 00:40:44,090
Yeah, we waited,
but we were, like,

704
00:40:44,095 --> 00:40:46,095
starving, so we...

705
00:40:46,394 --> 00:40:48,794
I'm sorry I kept
Bella from dinner.

706
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:51,206
We just sort of ran
into each other...

707
00:40:51,211 --> 00:40:53,211
and got talking.

708
00:40:53,634 --> 00:40:54,931
Yeah.
- No.

709
00:40:54,936 --> 00:40:58,667
No, we totally understand.
I mean, that happens, right?

710
00:40:59,574 --> 00:41:00,703
Yeah, we were...

711
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:02,792
We were, yeah, we were
just leaving. So...

712
00:41:02,797 --> 00:41:03,639
Let's get this...

713
00:41:03,644 --> 00:41:05,644
Bella, if you wanna...

714
00:41:05,947 --> 00:41:09,041
I think I should make sure
Bella gets something to eat.

715
00:41:09,117 --> 00:41:11,117
If you'd like.

716
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:14,313
I'll drive you home myself.

717
00:41:14,388 --> 00:41:16,754
That's so thoughtful.

718
00:41:16,824 --> 00:41:19,292
It's really thoughtful. Yeah.

719
00:41:19,927 --> 00:41:22,088
Yeah. I should eat something.

720
00:41:22,163 --> 00:41:24,163
Yeah.

721
00:41:24,298 --> 00:41:26,175
Okay, so we'll
see you tomorrow.

722
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:26,896
Okay, yeah.

723
00:41:26,901 --> 00:41:28,901
See ya.
- Okay.

724
00:41:39,614 --> 00:41:42,014
All right, one
mushroom ravioli.

725
00:41:42,850 --> 00:41:45,250
Thanks.
- Yeah, no problem.

726
00:41:46,187 --> 00:41:47,761
So are you sure
there isn't anything

727
00:41:47,766 --> 00:41:48,551
I can get for you?

728
00:41:48,556 --> 00:41:50,556
No. No, thank you.

729
00:41:51,259 --> 00:41:53,259
Let me know.

730
00:41:58,833 --> 00:42:00,994
You're really not gonna eat?

731
00:42:03,171 --> 00:42:05,798
No, I'm on a special diet.

732
00:42:08,074 --> 00:42:10,440
You gotta give
me some answers.

733
00:42:11,611 --> 00:42:13,611
Yes, no.

734
00:42:13,847 --> 00:42:16,247
To get to the other side.

735
00:42:16,850 --> 00:42:18,850
1.77245...

736
00:42:18,852 --> 00:42:21,249
I don't want to know
what the square root of pi is.

737
00:42:21,254 --> 00:42:23,018
You knew that?

738
00:42:23,023 --> 00:42:25,150
How did you know where I was?

739
00:42:25,225 --> 00:42:26,888
I didn't.

740
00:42:26,893 --> 00:42:29,589
All right.
- What?

741
00:42:29,663 --> 00:42:31,663
Don't leave. I...

742
00:42:35,168 --> 00:42:37,295
Did you follow me?

743
00:42:38,972 --> 00:42:40,335
I...

744
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:44,777
I feel very protective of you.

745
00:42:47,647 --> 00:42:49,044
So you followed me.

746
00:42:49,049 --> 00:42:50,742
I was trying to
keep a distance...

747
00:42:50,747 --> 00:42:52,113
unless you needed my help,

748
00:42:52,118 --> 00:42:55,250
and then I heard what
those low-lifes...

749
00:42:55,255 --> 00:42:56,418
were thinking.

750
00:42:56,423 --> 00:42:58,386
Wait.

751
00:42:58,391 --> 00:43:01,326
You say you heard what
they were thinking?

752
00:43:04,331 --> 00:43:06,331
So what, you...

753
00:43:07,167 --> 00:43:09,167
You read minds?

754
00:43:11,771 --> 00:43:15,468
I can read every
mind in this room.

755
00:43:16,576 --> 00:43:18,576
Apart from yours.

756
00:43:20,313 --> 00:43:23,976
There's money, sex,

757
00:43:25,452 --> 00:43:27,452
money,

758
00:43:27,587 --> 00:43:29,184
sex,

759
00:43:29,189 --> 00:43:31,189
cat.

760
00:43:33,426 --> 00:43:36,259
And then you, nothing.

761
00:43:38,131 --> 00:43:40,224
It's very frustrating.

762
00:43:42,702 --> 00:43:45,102
Is there something
wrong with me?

763
00:43:46,506 --> 00:43:48,701
See, I tell you
I can read minds,

764
00:43:48,775 --> 00:43:51,835
and you think there's
something wrong with you.

765
00:43:59,386 --> 00:44:01,386
What is it?

766
00:44:01,521 --> 00:44:08,324
I don't have the strength
to stay away from you anymore.

767
00:44:10,830 --> 00:44:12,830
Then don't.

768
00:44:32,085 --> 00:44:34,679
Okay, I think I'm
warm enough now.

769
00:44:41,127 --> 00:44:43,152
Your hand is so cold.

770
00:44:54,074 --> 00:44:55,170
Whoa.

771
00:44:55,175 --> 00:44:57,175
What is going on?

772
00:44:58,578 --> 00:45:00,578
My dad's still here.

773
00:45:00,613 --> 00:45:02,613
Can you pull in?

774
00:45:04,985 --> 00:45:07,453
That's my father's
car on the end.

775
00:45:07,887 --> 00:45:09,912
What is he doing here?

776
00:45:12,659 --> 00:45:14,820
Carlisle, what's going on?

777
00:45:16,396 --> 00:45:18,598
Waylon Forge was
found in a boat...

778
00:45:18,603 --> 00:45:20,595
out near his place.

779
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:23,228
I just examined the body.
- He died?

780
00:45:24,738 --> 00:45:27,036
How?
- Animal attack.

781
00:45:29,442 --> 00:45:30,767
Was it the same one that...

782
00:45:30,772 --> 00:45:32,707
got that security
guard down in Mason?

783
00:45:32,712 --> 00:45:34,042
Most likely.

784
00:45:34,047 --> 00:45:36,300
Well, it's getting
closer to town, then.

785
00:45:36,305 --> 00:45:37,946
Bella, you should go inside.

786
00:45:37,951 --> 00:45:40,442
Waylon was your
father's friend.

787
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:42,520
Okay.

788
00:45:45,392 --> 00:45:47,392
I'll see you later.

789
00:45:59,339 --> 00:46:01,339
Hey.
- Hey.

790
00:46:05,011 --> 00:46:07,011
Dad, I'm really sorry.

791
00:46:11,518 --> 00:46:14,078
I've known him
going on 30 years.

792
00:46:29,169 --> 00:46:32,002
Don't worry, we're
gonna find this thing.

793
00:46:33,239 --> 00:46:35,239
Meantime.

794
00:46:35,942 --> 00:46:38,376
I want you to carry
this with you.

795
00:46:40,814 --> 00:46:42,221
I don't know if you...

796
00:46:42,226 --> 00:46:44,978
It'll give your old
man some peace of mind.

797
00:46:45,051 --> 00:46:47,051
Okay.

798
00:46:49,589 --> 00:46:51,589
Let's go home.

799
00:47:36,870 --> 00:47:38,870
Cold One.

800
00:49:45,464 --> 00:49:48,262
You're impossibly
fast and strong.

801
00:49:49,601 --> 00:49:52,502
Your skin is pale
white and ice-cold.

802
00:49:53,472 --> 00:49:55,472
Your eyes change color.

803
00:49:56,341 --> 00:49:58,202
And sometimes you speak...

804
00:49:58,207 --> 00:50:00,641
like you're from
a different time.

805
00:50:02,281 --> 00:50:04,312
You never eat or
drink anything.

806
00:50:04,317 --> 00:50:06,411
You don't go out
in the sunlight.

807
00:50:09,588 --> 00:50:11,588
How old are you?

808
00:50:12,658 --> 00:50:14,658
Seventeen.

809
00:50:16,395 --> 00:50:18,522
How long have you been 17?

810
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
A while.

811
00:50:36,448 --> 00:50:38,448
I know what you are.

812
00:50:40,786 --> 00:50:42,786
Say it.

813
00:50:45,724 --> 00:50:47,724
Out loud.

814
00:50:50,028 --> 00:50:52,028
Say it.

815
00:50:57,302 --> 00:50:59,302
Vampire.

816
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:04,040
Are you afraid?

817
00:51:11,850 --> 00:51:13,850
No.

818
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:18,489
Then ask me the most
basic question.

819
00:51:18,557 --> 00:51:20,557
What do we eat?

820
00:51:23,195 --> 00:51:25,195
You won't hurt me.

821
00:51:29,935 --> 00:51:31,935
Where are we going?

822
00:51:32,971 --> 00:51:34,201
Up the mountain.

823
00:51:34,206 --> 00:51:36,206
Out of the cloud bank.

824
00:51:36,241 --> 00:51:39,404
You need to see what
I look like in the sunlight.

825
00:51:58,530 --> 00:52:01,090
This is why we don't show
ourselves in sunlight.

826
00:52:01,166 --> 00:52:03,634
People would know
we're different.

827
00:52:13,812 --> 00:52:15,812
This is what I am.

828
00:52:21,019 --> 00:52:23,019
It's like diamonds.

829
00:52:31,530 --> 00:52:33,530
You're beautiful.

830
00:52:36,401 --> 00:52:38,031
Beautiful?

831
00:52:38,036 --> 00:52:40,664
This is the skin of
a killer, Bella.

832
00:52:47,179 --> 00:52:49,179
I'm a killer.

833
00:52:50,816 --> 00:52:52,816
I don't believe that.

834
00:52:53,385 --> 00:52:55,979
That's because you
believe the lie.

835
00:52:56,588 --> 00:52:58,588
It's camouflage.

836
00:53:00,525 --> 00:53:03,392
I'm the world's most
dangerous predator.

837
00:53:04,196 --> 00:53:07,359
Everything about
me invites you in,

838
00:53:07,933 --> 00:53:11,266
my voice, my face,
even my smell.

839
00:53:12,337 --> 00:53:14,862
As if I would
need any of that.

840
00:53:17,576 --> 00:53:19,737
As if you could outrun me.

841
00:53:25,484 --> 00:53:27,748
As if you could fight me off.

842
00:53:31,189 --> 00:53:33,189
I'm designed to kill.

843
00:53:36,027 --> 00:53:38,027
I don't care.

844
00:53:38,530 --> 00:53:40,657
I've killed people before.

845
00:53:42,434 --> 00:53:44,434
It does not matter.

846
00:53:48,907 --> 00:53:50,907
I wanted to kill you.

847
00:53:54,246 --> 00:53:57,148
I've never wanted
a human's blood...

848
00:53:57,153 --> 00:53:59,153
so much in my life.

849
00:53:59,951 --> 00:54:01,951
I trust you.

850
00:54:03,989 --> 00:54:05,989
Don't.

851
00:54:06,625 --> 00:54:08,625
I'm here. I trust you.

852
00:54:13,131 --> 00:54:13,775
My family,

853
00:54:13,780 --> 00:54:16,362
we're different from
others of our kind.

854
00:54:16,434 --> 00:54:18,265
We only hunt animals.

855
00:54:18,270 --> 00:54:20,898
We've learned to
control our thirst.

856
00:54:21,606 --> 00:54:24,336
But it's you, your scent,

857
00:54:26,845 --> 00:54:29,075
it's like a drug to me.

858
00:54:30,482 --> 00:54:31,646
You're like...

859
00:54:31,651 --> 00:54:34,316
my own personal
brand of heroin.

860
00:54:41,359 --> 00:54:44,522
Why did you hate me
so much when we met?

861
00:54:44,596 --> 00:54:46,359
I did.

862
00:54:46,364 --> 00:54:49,094
Only for making me
want you so badly.

863
00:54:49,701 --> 00:54:52,670
I still don't know if
I can control myself.

864
00:54:54,639 --> 00:54:56,639
I know you can.

865
00:55:04,716 --> 00:55:06,775
I can't read your mind.

866
00:55:07,452 --> 00:55:10,421
You have to tell me
what you're thinking.

867
00:55:12,891 --> 00:55:14,891
Now I'm afraid.

868
00:55:19,598 --> 00:55:21,598
Good.

869
00:55:22,067 --> 00:55:24,067
I'm not afraid of you.

870
00:55:27,739 --> 00:55:29,627
I'm only afraid of losing you.

871
00:55:29,632 --> 00:55:31,835
I feel like you're
gonna disappear.

872
00:55:38,950 --> 00:55:41,942
You don't know how long
I've waited for you.

873
00:55:50,161 --> 00:55:52,994
So the lion fell in
love with the lamb.

874
00:55:56,601 --> 00:55:58,498
What a stupid lamb.

875
00:55:58,503 --> 00:56:01,097
What a sick, masochistic lion.

876
00:57:26,690 --> 00:57:29,784
About three things
I was absolutely positive.

877
00:57:31,161 --> 00:57:33,161
First.

878
00:57:33,630 --> 00:57:35,630
Edward was a vampire.

879
00:57:40,037 --> 00:57:42,037
Second,

880
00:57:42,106 --> 00:57:44,106
there was a part of him,

881
00:57:44,108 --> 00:57:45,048
and I didn't know...

882
00:57:45,053 --> 00:57:47,053
how dominant that
part might be,

883
00:57:47,745 --> 00:57:49,940
that thirsted for my blood.

884
00:57:53,884 --> 00:57:55,884
And third.

885
00:57:56,453 --> 00:57:59,117
I was unconditionally
and irrevocably...

886
00:57:59,122 --> 00:58:01,122
in love with him.

887
00:58:05,896 --> 00:58:08,990
Monte Carlo?
That's our prom theme?

888
00:58:09,066 --> 00:58:13,765
Gambling, tuxedos,
and Bond, James Bond.

889
00:58:17,708 --> 00:58:19,708
Oh, my God.

890
00:58:28,585 --> 00:58:30,585
Wow.

891
00:58:31,922 --> 00:58:34,254
You know, everybody's staring.

892
00:58:38,195 --> 00:58:41,562
Not that guy. No,
he just looked.

893
00:58:44,001 --> 00:58:46,799
I'm breaking all the
rules now anyway.

894
00:58:46,870 --> 00:58:48,997
Since I'm going to hell.

895
00:58:53,410 --> 00:58:56,208
So, does a person
have to be dying...

896
00:58:58,782 --> 00:59:00,782
to become like you?

897
00:59:01,251 --> 00:59:04,220
No, that's just Carlisle.

898
00:59:05,789 --> 00:59:09,247
He'd never do this to someone
who had another choice.

899
00:59:10,828 --> 00:59:13,524
So, how long have
you been like this?

900
00:59:14,464 --> 00:59:16,464
Since 1918.

901
00:59:16,867 --> 00:59:20,598
That's when Carlisle found me
dying of Spanish influenza.

902
00:59:22,739 --> 00:59:24,739
What was it like?

903
00:59:25,075 --> 00:59:27,441
The venom was excruciating.

904
00:59:28,145 --> 00:59:30,306
But what Carlisle
did was much harder.

905
00:59:30,380 --> 00:59:32,848
Not many of us have the
restraint to do that.

906
00:59:32,916 --> 00:59:35,578
But didn't he just
have to bite?

907
00:59:37,821 --> 00:59:39,821
Not exactly.

908
00:59:39,857 --> 00:59:41,857
When we taste...

909
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:47,196
human blood, a sort
of frenzy begins,

910
00:59:48,699 --> 00:59:51,190
and it's almost
impossible to stop.

911
00:59:53,403 --> 00:59:55,200
But Carlisle did.

912
00:59:55,205 --> 00:59:58,038
First with me
and then with his wife, Esme.

913
00:59:58,108 --> 01:00:02,636
So is Carlisle the real reason
that you don't kill people?

914
01:00:06,316 --> 01:00:08,580
No, he's not the only reason.

915
01:00:11,121 --> 01:00:13,817
I don't want to be a monster.

916
01:00:15,459 --> 01:00:16,221
My family,

917
01:00:16,226 --> 01:00:19,589
we think of ourselves
as vegetarians, right,

918
01:00:19,663 --> 01:00:22,996
'cause we only survive
on the blood of animals.

919
01:00:23,066 --> 01:00:25,066
But it's...

920
01:00:25,369 --> 01:00:28,065
It's like a human
only living on tofu.

921
01:00:28,138 --> 01:00:29,844
It keeps you strong,

922
01:00:29,849 --> 01:00:32,666
but you're never
fully satisfied.

923
01:00:35,779 --> 01:00:38,370
It wouldn't be like
drinking your blood,

924
01:00:38,375 --> 01:00:40,375
for instance.

925
01:00:44,621 --> 01:00:47,681
Was it other vampires
that killed Waylon?

926
01:00:47,758 --> 01:00:49,087
Yeah.

927
01:00:49,092 --> 01:00:50,835
There are others out there,

928
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:53,358
and we run into them
from time to time.

929
01:00:55,332 --> 01:00:57,204
Can the rest of your family...

930
01:00:57,209 --> 01:00:59,268
read people's
minds like you can?

931
01:01:02,339 --> 01:01:04,339
No. That's just me.

932
01:01:04,975 --> 01:01:07,808
But Alice can see the future.

933
01:01:08,845 --> 01:01:10,845
I bet she saw me coming.

934
01:01:12,182 --> 01:01:14,616
Alice's visions
are subjective.

935
01:01:15,052 --> 01:01:17,850
I mean, the future
can always change.

936
01:01:28,298 --> 01:01:31,028
Could you act human?
I mean, I've got neighbors.

937
01:01:31,101 --> 01:01:33,968
I'm gonna take you to
my place tomorrow.

938
01:01:35,439 --> 01:01:37,302
Thanks.

939
01:01:37,307 --> 01:01:40,242
Wait, like, with your family?
- Yeah.

940
01:01:41,545 --> 01:01:43,706
What if they don't like me?

941
01:01:44,581 --> 01:01:46,249
So, you're worried not because...

942
01:01:46,254 --> 01:01:48,246
you'll be in a house
full of vampires,

943
01:01:48,251 --> 01:01:51,379
but because you think
they won't approve of you?

944
01:01:51,688 --> 01:01:53,688
I'm glad I amuse you.

945
01:01:55,158 --> 01:01:57,158
What is it?

946
01:01:58,028 --> 01:02:00,028
Complication.

947
01:02:01,665 --> 01:02:03,758
I'll pick you up tomorrow.

948
01:02:29,493 --> 01:02:32,428
Hey. Come to visit your truck?

949
01:02:33,597 --> 01:02:36,031
Looks good. Got that dent out.

950
01:02:36,099 --> 01:02:36,365
Yeah.

951
01:02:36,370 --> 01:02:38,727
Actually, we came to
visit your flat-screen.

952
01:02:38,802 --> 01:02:41,032
First Mariners game
of the season.

953
01:02:41,104 --> 01:02:43,739
Plus Jacob here keeps
bugging me about...

954
01:02:43,744 --> 01:02:44,903
seeing you again.

955
01:02:44,908 --> 01:02:46,908
Great, Dad. Thanks.

956
01:02:46,910 --> 01:02:49,105
Just keeping it real, son.

957
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:52,310
Vitamin R.

958
01:02:52,315 --> 01:02:54,112
Well done, Chief.

959
01:02:54,117 --> 01:02:56,517
Harry Clearwater's
homemade fish fry.

960
01:02:56,586 --> 01:02:58,586
Good man.

961
01:03:00,457 --> 01:03:02,320
Any luck with
that Waylon case?

962
01:03:02,325 --> 01:03:04,307
Well, I don't think
it was an animal...

963
01:03:04,312 --> 01:03:05,190
that killed him.

964
01:03:05,195 --> 01:03:07,254
Never thought it was.

965
01:03:08,765 --> 01:03:10,562
So spread the word
out at the rez, huh?

966
01:03:10,567 --> 01:03:12,197
Keep the kids
out of the woods.

967
01:03:12,202 --> 01:03:14,202
Will do.

968
01:03:14,304 --> 01:03:17,273
Don't want no one else
getting hurt, do we?

969
01:03:48,939 --> 01:03:50,939
Whoa.

970
01:03:51,274 --> 01:03:53,274
This is incredible.

971
01:03:56,146 --> 01:03:58,808
It's so light and
open, you know?

972
01:04:00,450 --> 01:04:02,013
What did you expect,

973
01:04:02,018 --> 01:04:04,443
coffins and
dungeons and moats?

974
01:04:04,955 --> 01:04:07,355
No, not the moats.

975
01:04:08,358 --> 01:04:10,358
Not the moats.

976
01:04:16,700 --> 01:04:19,669
This is the one place
we don't have to hide.

977
01:04:22,205 --> 01:04:24,102
I told them not to do this.

978
01:04:24,107 --> 01:04:26,266
You add a little
bit of olive oil...

979
01:04:26,271 --> 01:04:27,839
to a non-stick sauté pan,

980
01:04:27,844 --> 01:04:29,103
and you want to cook...

981
01:04:29,108 --> 01:04:31,245
with the olive oil
in medium-high heat.

982
01:04:31,314 --> 01:04:33,287
What I do, I cut
this in strips,

983
01:04:33,292 --> 01:04:35,147
and then we gonna cut this...

984
01:04:35,152 --> 01:04:38,280
Is she even Italian?
- Her name is Bella.

985
01:04:38,355 --> 01:04:41,324
I'm sure she'll love
it, no matter what.

986
01:04:41,391 --> 01:04:43,391
Get a whiff of that.

987
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:45,887
Here comes the human.

988
01:04:49,765 --> 01:04:52,393
Bella, we're making
Italiano for you.

989
01:04:53,569 --> 01:04:55,071
Bella, this is Esme.

990
01:04:55,076 --> 01:04:58,006
My mother for all
intents and purposes.

991
01:05:00,709 --> 01:05:01,709
You've given us an excuse...

992
01:05:01,714 --> 01:05:03,073
to use the kitchen
for the first time.

993
01:05:03,078 --> 01:05:04,308
I hope you're hungry.

994
01:05:04,313 --> 01:05:06,941
Yeah, absolutely.
- She already ate.

995
01:05:13,355 --> 01:05:15,252
Perfect.

996
01:05:15,257 --> 01:05:16,894
Yeah, it's just because

997
01:05:16,899 --> 01:05:19,250
I know that you
guys don't eat...

998
01:05:19,328 --> 01:05:21,819
Of course. It's very
considerate of you.

999
01:05:21,897 --> 01:05:24,457
Just ignore Rosalie. I do.
- Yeah.

1000
01:05:24,533 --> 01:05:25,889
Let's just keep pretending...

1001
01:05:25,894 --> 01:05:27,765
like this isn't
dangerous for all of us.

1002
01:05:27,770 --> 01:05:31,331
I would never tell
anybody anything.

1003
01:05:32,007 --> 01:05:33,837
She knows that.

1004
01:05:33,842 --> 01:05:35,190
Yeah, well, the problem is,

1005
01:05:35,195 --> 01:05:37,007
you two have gone
public now, so...

1006
01:05:37,012 --> 01:05:38,075
Emmett.

1007
01:05:38,080 --> 01:05:39,843
No, she should know.

1008
01:05:39,848 --> 01:05:41,120
The entire family...

1009
01:05:41,125 --> 01:05:43,545
will be implicated
if this ends badly.

1010
01:05:44,053 --> 01:05:46,053
Badly, as in...

1011
01:05:47,356 --> 01:05:49,722
I would become the meal.

1012
01:05:57,099 --> 01:05:59,099
Hi, Bella.

1013
01:06:02,304 --> 01:06:04,304
I'm Alice.

1014
01:06:04,740 --> 01:06:06,740
Hi.
- Hi.

1015
01:06:07,910 --> 01:06:09,873
You do smell good.

1016
01:06:09,878 --> 01:06:11,108
Alice, what are you...

1017
01:06:11,113 --> 01:06:11,816
It's okay.

1018
01:06:11,821 --> 01:06:14,571
Bella and I are gonna
be great friends.

1019
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:18,318
Sorry,

1020
01:06:18,323 --> 01:06:20,388
Jasper's our
newest vegetarian.

1021
01:06:20,456 --> 01:06:22,549
It's a little
difficult for him.

1022
01:06:22,625 --> 01:06:24,588
It's a pleasure to meet you.

1023
01:06:24,593 --> 01:06:27,391
It's okay, Jasper.
You won't hurt her.

1024
01:06:28,864 --> 01:06:30,595
All right, I'm gonna take you...

1025
01:06:30,600 --> 01:06:32,563
on a tour of the
rest of the house.

1026
01:06:32,568 --> 01:06:34,866
Okay.
- Well, I'll see you soon.

1027
01:06:34,937 --> 01:06:36,937
Okay.

1028
01:06:38,140 --> 01:06:40,140
Cute.
- I know.

1029
01:06:40,276 --> 01:06:41,572
I think that went well.

1030
01:06:41,577 --> 01:06:43,977
Clean this up. Now.

1031
01:06:44,046 --> 01:06:47,174
Was that as weird for
you as it was for me?

1032
01:06:47,249 --> 01:06:49,249
I don't know.

1033
01:06:54,723 --> 01:06:56,723
Graduation caps?

1034
01:06:57,559 --> 01:07:00,392
Yeah. It's a private joke.

1035
01:07:01,297 --> 01:07:03,297
We matriculate a lot.

1036
01:07:04,767 --> 01:07:06,730
That's kind of miserable.

1037
01:07:06,735 --> 01:07:09,602
I mean, repeating high school
over and over.

1038
01:07:09,672 --> 01:07:11,209
True, but the younger
we start out...

1039
01:07:11,214 --> 01:07:11,835
in a new place,

1040
01:07:11,840 --> 01:07:13,967
the longer we can stay there.

1041
01:07:14,043 --> 01:07:16,043
Come on.

1042
01:07:25,821 --> 01:07:27,821
Yeah, this is my room.

1043
01:07:40,569 --> 01:07:42,499
No bed?

1044
01:07:42,504 --> 01:07:44,504
No, I don't...

1045
01:07:44,840 --> 01:07:46,840
I don't sleep.

1046
01:07:47,242 --> 01:07:49,574
Ever?
- No, not at all.

1047
01:07:52,781 --> 01:07:54,781
Okay.

1048
01:08:02,491 --> 01:08:04,789
Boy, you have so much music.

1049
01:08:05,561 --> 01:08:07,756
What are you listening to?

1050
01:08:11,233 --> 01:08:13,233
It's Debussy.

1051
01:08:15,237 --> 01:08:17,237
I don't know...
- Yeah.

1052
01:08:20,943 --> 01:08:23,241
Claire De Lune is great.

1053
01:08:57,880 --> 01:09:00,576
What?
- I can't dance.

1054
01:09:09,958 --> 01:09:12,188
Well, I could always make you.

1055
01:09:14,496 --> 01:09:16,496
I'm not scared of you.

1056
01:09:19,868 --> 01:09:22,803
Well, you really
shouldn't have said that.

1057
01:09:27,176 --> 01:09:30,043
You better hold on
tight, spider monkey.

1058
01:09:35,150 --> 01:09:37,150
Do you trust me?

1059
01:09:37,419 --> 01:09:39,419
In theory.

1060
01:09:39,588 --> 01:09:41,588
Then close your eyes.

1061
01:10:06,048 --> 01:10:08,048
What?

1062
01:10:08,684 --> 01:10:10,684
This isn't real.

1063
01:10:10,953 --> 01:10:13,547
This kind of stuff
just doesn't exist.

1064
01:10:13,622 --> 01:10:15,622
It does in my world.

1065
01:11:45,314 --> 01:11:47,314
Hold up.

1066
01:11:52,054 --> 01:11:54,054
It's human.

1067
01:11:57,593 --> 01:12:00,494
Arizona. Yo, what's happening?

1068
01:12:01,029 --> 01:12:03,054
So you and Cullen, huh?

1069
01:12:03,131 --> 01:12:05,599
That's... I don't like it.

1070
01:12:06,401 --> 01:12:08,131
I mean, I don't know,

1071
01:12:08,136 --> 01:12:11,401
he just looks at you
like you're something to eat.

1072
01:12:14,009 --> 01:12:16,534
Here's your veggie
plate, Stephenie.

1073
01:12:17,045 --> 01:12:19,639
Hey, sorry I'm late.
Biology project.

1074
01:12:20,781 --> 01:12:22,577
I ordered you the
spinach salad.

1075
01:12:22,582 --> 01:12:23,713
I hope that's okay.

1076
01:12:23,718 --> 01:12:25,815
You should order one
for yourself next time.

1077
01:12:25,820 --> 01:12:27,845
Cut back on the steak.

1078
01:12:28,189 --> 01:12:30,487
Hey, I'm as
healthy as a horse.

1079
01:12:31,459 --> 01:12:33,984
Say, Chief, boys want to know,

1080
01:12:35,363 --> 01:12:38,764
did you find anything
down by Queets River today?

1081
01:12:41,435 --> 01:12:43,903
Yeah, we found a bare
human footprint,

1082
01:12:43,971 --> 01:12:45,655
but it looks like
whoever that is,

1083
01:12:45,660 --> 01:12:46,402
is headed east,

1084
01:12:46,407 --> 01:12:48,428
so Kitsap County
sheriff is gonna take...

1085
01:12:48,433 --> 01:12:49,238
over from here.

1086
01:12:49,243 --> 01:12:50,973
Okay.
- Okay?

1087
01:12:50,978 --> 01:12:53,344
I just hope they
catch him fast.

1088
01:13:02,657 --> 01:13:05,490
Looks like your friends
are flagging you.

1089
01:13:07,294 --> 01:13:09,091
It's okay if you
wanna go join them.

1090
01:13:09,096 --> 01:13:11,758
I'm just gonna turn
in early anyway.

1091
01:13:11,832 --> 01:13:13,262
Me, too.

1092
01:13:13,267 --> 01:13:15,758
Bella, it's Friday
night. Go out.

1093
01:13:16,771 --> 01:13:19,301
Looks like the Newton boy's
got a big smile for you.

1094
01:13:19,306 --> 01:13:21,365
Yeah, he's a good buddy.

1095
01:13:22,243 --> 01:13:24,541
What about any of these
other yahoos in town?

1096
01:13:24,612 --> 01:13:26,637
Anybody interest you?

1097
01:13:28,115 --> 01:13:30,413
Dad, we gonna talk about boys?

1098
01:13:31,752 --> 01:13:33,752
Yeah, I guess not.

1099
01:13:34,155 --> 01:13:37,591
I just feel like I leave
you alone too much.

1100
01:13:37,858 --> 01:13:40,053
You should be around people.

1101
01:13:41,295 --> 01:13:43,661
I don't really
mind being alone.

1102
01:13:44,265 --> 01:13:47,325
I guess I'm kind of like
my dad in that way.

1103
01:13:51,772 --> 01:13:54,468
So, how's all the
baseball stuff going?

1104
01:13:54,809 --> 01:13:57,107
Phil's working so hard.

1105
01:13:57,178 --> 01:13:59,646
You know, spring training.

1106
01:13:59,714 --> 01:14:01,206
We're looking for
a house to rent...

1107
01:14:01,211 --> 01:14:02,745
in case things become
more permanent.

1108
01:14:02,750 --> 01:14:04,146
You'd like Jacksonville, baby.

1109
01:14:04,151 --> 01:14:05,715
Yeah?

1110
01:14:05,720 --> 01:14:07,720
I'm really liking Forks.

1111
01:14:07,755 --> 01:14:09,755
What?

1112
01:14:10,725 --> 01:14:12,588
Forks is growing on me.

1113
01:14:12,593 --> 01:14:15,460
Could a guy have anything
to do with that?

1114
01:14:15,529 --> 01:14:17,656
Well, yeah.

1115
01:14:17,932 --> 01:14:21,766
I knew it. Tell me everything.
What is he? Jock? Indie?

1116
01:14:21,836 --> 01:14:24,134
I bet he's smart. Is he smart?

1117
01:14:26,207 --> 01:14:28,505
Mom, can I talk to you later?

1118
01:14:28,576 --> 01:14:31,704
Come on, we gotta talk boys.
Are you being safe?

1119
01:14:37,017 --> 01:14:39,281
How did you get in here?

1120
01:14:39,353 --> 01:14:41,353
The window.

1121
01:14:41,355 --> 01:14:43,355
Do you do that a lot?

1122
01:14:44,225 --> 01:14:46,887
Well, just the past
couple of months.

1123
01:14:50,798 --> 01:14:52,959
I like watching you sleep.

1124
01:14:55,569 --> 01:14:58,094
It's kind of
fascinating to me.

1125
01:15:02,676 --> 01:15:04,974
I always want to
try one thing.

1126
01:15:06,247 --> 01:15:08,247
Just stay very still.

1127
01:15:15,189 --> 01:15:17,189
Don't move.

1128
01:16:00,634 --> 01:16:02,634
Stop it.

1129
01:16:04,672 --> 01:16:06,672
I'm sorry.

1130
01:16:09,009 --> 01:16:11,170
I'm stronger than I thought.

1131
01:16:11,779 --> 01:16:14,270
Yeah. I wish I
could say the same.

1132
01:16:19,086 --> 01:16:21,646
I can't ever lose
control with you.

1133
01:16:27,962 --> 01:16:29,962
Hey, don't go.

1134
01:17:17,344 --> 01:17:19,972
Hey, got you another one.
- Thanks.

1135
01:17:20,047 --> 01:17:22,515
I have a date with
Edward Cullen.

1136
01:17:24,752 --> 01:17:27,277
He's a little old
for you, isn't he?

1137
01:17:27,755 --> 01:17:29,451
No.

1138
01:17:29,456 --> 01:17:31,686
He's a junior. I'm a junior.

1139
01:17:32,426 --> 01:17:34,792
I thought you
liked the Cullens.

1140
01:17:35,129 --> 01:17:37,791
I thought you didn't like
any of the boys in town.

1141
01:17:37,865 --> 01:17:40,095
Edward doesn't live in town.

1142
01:17:40,768 --> 01:17:42,768
Technically.

1143
01:17:45,005 --> 01:17:47,005
He's right outside.

1144
01:17:47,207 --> 01:17:48,704
He is?

1145
01:17:48,709 --> 01:17:51,678
Yeah, he wanted to
meet you, officially.

1146
01:17:53,948 --> 01:17:56,212
All right. Bring him in.

1147
01:17:58,252 --> 01:18:00,252
Could you be nice?

1148
01:18:01,088 --> 01:18:03,088
He's important.

1149
01:18:14,301 --> 01:18:15,931
Chief Swan.

1150
01:18:15,936 --> 01:18:18,178
I want to formally
introduce myself.

1151
01:18:18,183 --> 01:18:19,368
I'm Edward Cullen.

1152
01:18:19,373 --> 01:18:21,373
Hi, Edward.

1153
01:18:21,709 --> 01:18:23,038
Bella won't be out
too late tonight.

1154
01:18:23,043 --> 01:18:25,409
She's just gonna play baseball
with my family.

1155
01:18:25,479 --> 01:18:26,542
Baseball?

1156
01:18:26,547 --> 01:18:28,510
Yes, sir, that's the plan.

1157
01:18:28,515 --> 01:18:30,710
Bella's gonna play baseball.

1158
01:18:31,852 --> 01:18:33,615
Well, good luck with that.

1159
01:18:33,620 --> 01:18:36,418
I'll take good care
of her. I promise.

1160
01:18:39,460 --> 01:18:41,460
Hey.

1161
01:18:41,795 --> 01:18:43,795
Still got that pepper spray?

1162
01:18:43,797 --> 01:18:45,797
Yeah, Dad.

1163
01:18:50,471 --> 01:18:53,201
And since when do
vampires like baseball?

1164
01:18:53,273 --> 01:18:56,003
Well, it's the
American pastime,

1165
01:18:56,076 --> 01:18:58,636
and there's a
thunderstorm coming.

1166
01:18:58,712 --> 01:19:00,458
It's the only
time we can play.

1167
01:19:00,463 --> 01:19:02,463
You'll see why.

1168
01:19:14,695 --> 01:19:15,791
Hey.

1169
01:19:15,796 --> 01:19:17,796
Glad you're here.
We need an umpire.

1170
01:19:17,865 --> 01:19:19,461
She thinks we cheat.

1171
01:19:19,466 --> 01:19:21,466
I know you cheat.

1172
01:19:22,936 --> 01:19:25,482
Call them as you
see them, Bella.

1173
01:19:25,487 --> 01:19:27,487
Okay.

1174
01:19:35,416 --> 01:19:37,416
It's time.

1175
01:19:45,159 --> 01:19:48,128
Okay, now I see why
you need the thunder.

1176
01:19:52,633 --> 01:19:55,328
That's gotta be a
home run, right?

1177
01:19:55,401 --> 01:19:57,401
Edward's very fast.

1178
01:19:58,071 --> 01:20:02,007
Ooh, baby,
don't you know I suffer?

1179
01:20:02,075 --> 01:20:05,511
Ooh, baby, I'm a fool for you

1180
01:20:05,578 --> 01:20:07,578
Come home, Rosalie.

1181
01:20:10,349 --> 01:20:12,349
You're out.
- Out.

1182
01:20:13,319 --> 01:20:15,685
Babe, come on.
It's just a game.

1183
01:20:18,124 --> 01:20:21,457
You set my soul alight

1184
01:20:21,527 --> 01:20:23,057
Nice kitty.

1185
01:20:23,062 --> 01:20:26,259
Ooh

1186
01:20:26,332 --> 01:20:29,529
You set my soul alight

1187
01:20:29,602 --> 01:20:34,301
Ooh

1188
01:20:34,373 --> 01:20:37,467
You set my soul alight

1189
01:20:37,543 --> 01:20:42,139
Ooh

1190
01:20:42,215 --> 01:20:43,644
You set my soul alight

1191
01:20:43,649 --> 01:20:45,810
What are you doing?

1192
01:20:47,553 --> 01:21:03,263
Super massive black hole

1193
01:21:03,336 --> 01:21:05,336
My monkey man.

1194
01:21:19,519 --> 01:21:21,519
Stop.

1195
01:21:37,136 --> 01:21:39,866
They were leaving.
Then they heard us.

1196
01:21:39,939 --> 01:21:42,032
Let's go.
- It's too late.

1197
01:21:43,442 --> 01:21:45,442
Get your hair down.

1198
01:21:46,479 --> 01:21:47,632
Like that'll help.

1199
01:21:47,637 --> 01:21:50,074
I can smell her from
across the field.

1200
01:21:56,122 --> 01:21:57,588
I shouldn't have
brought you here.

1201
01:21:57,593 --> 01:21:58,152
I'm so sorry.

1202
01:21:58,157 --> 01:21:59,592
What? What are you...

1203
01:21:59,597 --> 01:22:01,923
Just be quiet and
stand behind me.

1204
01:22:23,182 --> 01:22:25,673
I believe this belongs to you.

1205
01:22:28,688 --> 01:22:29,817
Thank you.

1206
01:22:29,822 --> 01:22:31,752
I am Laurent.

1207
01:22:31,757 --> 01:22:33,816
And this is Victoria...

1208
01:22:35,261 --> 01:22:37,261
and James.

1209
01:22:37,730 --> 01:22:40,221
I'm Carlisle. This
is my family.

1210
01:22:42,068 --> 01:22:43,397
Hello.

1211
01:22:43,402 --> 01:22:45,266
I'm afraid your
hunting activities...

1212
01:22:45,271 --> 01:22:47,271
have caused something
of a mess for us.

1213
01:22:47,306 --> 01:22:49,203
Our apologies.

1214
01:22:49,208 --> 01:22:51,003
We didn't realize
the territory...

1215
01:22:51,008 --> 01:22:51,973
had been claimed.

1216
01:22:51,978 --> 01:22:55,470
Yes, well, we maintain
a permanent residence nearby.

1217
01:22:57,283 --> 01:22:59,283
Really?

1218
01:23:00,519 --> 01:23:03,613
Well, we won't be
a problem anymore.

1219
01:23:04,557 --> 01:23:06,557
We were just passing through.

1220
01:23:06,559 --> 01:23:09,392
The humans were tracking us,
but we led them east.

1221
01:23:09,462 --> 01:23:11,462
You should be safe.

1222
01:23:11,797 --> 01:23:13,797
Excellent.

1223
01:23:14,133 --> 01:23:15,796
So,

1224
01:23:15,801 --> 01:23:18,269
could you use
three more players?

1225
01:23:20,039 --> 01:23:22,269
Come on. Just one game.

1226
01:23:23,209 --> 01:23:25,172
Sure. Why not?

1227
01:23:25,177 --> 01:23:27,708
A few of us were leaving.
You could take their place.

1228
01:23:27,713 --> 01:23:29,713
We'll bat first.

1229
01:23:30,316 --> 01:23:32,614
I'm the one with the
wicked curveball.

1230
01:23:32,685 --> 01:23:35,119
Well, I think we
can handle that.

1231
01:23:36,589 --> 01:23:38,589
We shall see.

1232
01:23:58,311 --> 01:24:00,311
You brought a snack.

1233
01:24:02,748 --> 01:24:04,748
A human?

1234
01:24:07,453 --> 01:24:09,350
The girl is with us.

1235
01:24:09,355 --> 01:24:11,687
I think it best if you leave.

1236
01:24:15,328 --> 01:24:17,328
I can see the game is over.

1237
01:24:17,396 --> 01:24:19,396
We'll go now.

1238
01:24:22,168 --> 01:24:24,168
James.

1239
01:24:35,715 --> 01:24:37,842
Get Bella out of here.

1240
01:24:37,917 --> 01:24:39,917
Go.

1241
01:24:49,395 --> 01:24:52,455
Okay, I've got it. I've
got it. I'm all right.

1242
01:24:54,100 --> 01:24:56,568
What, now he's
coming after me?

1243
01:25:06,412 --> 01:25:08,030
Listen to me.
James is a tracker.

1244
01:25:08,035 --> 01:25:09,310
The hunt is his obsession.

1245
01:25:09,315 --> 01:25:10,188
I read his mind.

1246
01:25:10,193 --> 01:25:12,216
My reaction on the
field set him off.

1247
01:25:12,284 --> 01:25:15,617
I just made this his
most exciting game ever.

1248
01:25:15,688 --> 01:25:17,318
He's never gonna stop.
- What should we do?

1249
01:25:17,323 --> 01:25:18,715
We have to kill him.

1250
01:25:18,720 --> 01:25:21,089
Rip him apart and
burn the pieces.

1251
01:25:21,160 --> 01:25:22,923
Where we going?
- Away from Forks.

1252
01:25:22,928 --> 01:25:24,591
We'll get a ferry
to Vancouver.

1253
01:25:24,596 --> 01:25:25,893
I have to go home. Now.

1254
01:25:25,898 --> 01:25:29,299
You have to take me home.
- You can't go home.

1255
01:25:29,368 --> 01:25:30,904
He's just gonna trace
your scent there.

1256
01:25:30,909 --> 01:25:32,366
It's the first place
he's gonna look.

1257
01:25:32,371 --> 01:25:34,502
But my dad is there. We...
- It doesn't matter.

1258
01:25:34,507 --> 01:25:35,408
Yes, it does.

1259
01:25:35,413 --> 01:25:37,772
He could get killed
because of us.

1260
01:25:38,744 --> 01:25:40,269
Just let me get you
out of here first,

1261
01:25:40,274 --> 01:25:40,674
all right?

1262
01:25:40,679 --> 01:25:43,409
It's my dad. We
have to go back.

1263
01:25:43,482 --> 01:25:44,191
We'll figure a way...

1264
01:25:44,196 --> 01:25:45,312
to lead the tracker
away somehow.

1265
01:25:45,317 --> 01:25:48,184
I don't know. But we
have to do something.

1266
01:25:53,192 --> 01:25:54,578
Edward, I said leave me alone.

1267
01:25:54,583 --> 01:25:55,923
Bella, don't do this, please.

1268
01:25:55,928 --> 01:25:57,558
It's over. Get out.

1269
01:25:57,563 --> 01:25:59,160
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1270
01:25:59,165 --> 01:26:01,224
Bella? What's going on?

1271
01:26:01,934 --> 01:26:05,028
I just gotta get out of
here. I'm leaving now.

1272
01:26:06,972 --> 01:26:08,972
Hey.

1273
01:26:11,177 --> 01:26:12,940
Bella?

1274
01:26:12,945 --> 01:26:15,436
What am I gonna say to him?

1275
01:26:15,514 --> 01:26:17,514
I can't hurt him.

1276
01:26:17,616 --> 01:26:20,517
Bella, what's going on?
- You just have to.

1277
01:26:21,187 --> 01:26:23,212
I'll be down at the truck.

1278
01:26:28,527 --> 01:26:30,527
Did he hurt you?

1279
01:26:30,863 --> 01:26:32,863
No.

1280
01:26:34,366 --> 01:26:36,630
Break up with
you or something?

1281
01:26:36,702 --> 01:26:38,761
No, I broke up with him.

1282
01:26:41,173 --> 01:26:43,300
I thought you liked him.

1283
01:26:45,711 --> 01:26:47,675
Yeah, that's why
I have to leave.

1284
01:26:47,680 --> 01:26:50,376
I don't want this.
I have to go home.

1285
01:26:52,184 --> 01:26:53,681
Home? Your...

1286
01:26:53,686 --> 01:26:56,120
Your mom's not
even in Phoenix.

1287
01:26:56,188 --> 01:26:57,918
She'll come home.
I'll call her from the road.

1288
01:26:57,923 --> 01:27:00,221
You're not gonna
drive home right now.

1289
01:27:00,292 --> 01:27:01,320
You can sleep on it.

1290
01:27:01,325 --> 01:27:03,591
If you still feel like
going in the morning.

1291
01:27:03,662 --> 01:27:06,290
I'll take you to the airport.
- No. I want to drive.

1292
01:27:06,365 --> 01:27:08,295
It'll give me more
time to think.

1293
01:27:08,300 --> 01:27:09,656
I mean, if I get really tired,

1294
01:27:09,661 --> 01:27:11,198
I'll pull into a
motel. I promise.

1295
01:27:11,203 --> 01:27:14,172
Look, Bella, I know I'm not
that much fun to be around,

1296
01:27:14,240 --> 01:27:18,540
but I can change that.
We can do more stuff together.

1297
01:27:21,814 --> 01:27:23,210
Like what?

1298
01:27:23,215 --> 01:27:25,945
Like watch baseball
on the flat-screen?

1299
01:27:26,018 --> 01:27:28,781
Eat at the diner every night?
Steak and cobbler?

1300
01:27:28,853 --> 01:27:31,253
Dad, that's you.
That's not me.

1301
01:27:34,692 --> 01:27:36,489
Bella, come on, I just...

1302
01:27:36,494 --> 01:27:38,792
I just got you back.

1303
01:27:41,466 --> 01:27:43,666
Yeah, and, you know, if
I don't get out now,

1304
01:27:43,701 --> 01:27:46,795
then I'm just gonna be
stuck here like Mom.

1305
01:28:11,095 --> 01:28:13,461
Your father's
gonna forgive you.

1306
01:28:14,832 --> 01:28:17,164
Why don't you let me drive?

1307
01:28:22,840 --> 01:28:24,840
He won't.

1308
01:28:25,376 --> 01:28:27,537
You should've seen his face.

1309
01:28:29,347 --> 01:28:31,177
I told him the same thing
that my mom told him...

1310
01:28:31,182 --> 01:28:32,879
when she was leaving him.

1311
01:28:32,884 --> 01:28:35,478
It's the only way
he'd let you go.

1312
01:28:38,222 --> 01:28:40,182
Just don't worry
about him now.

1313
01:28:40,187 --> 01:28:42,591
He's safe. The
tracker's following us.

1314
01:28:45,363 --> 01:28:47,558
Oh, God.
- It's just Emmett.

1315
01:28:49,701 --> 01:28:52,033
Alice is in the car behind us.

1316
01:29:13,691 --> 01:29:15,691
Wait.

1317
01:29:15,927 --> 01:29:18,395
He came to warn
us about James.

1318
01:29:18,763 --> 01:29:20,239
This isn't my fight,

1319
01:29:20,244 --> 01:29:22,756
and I've grown
tired of his games,

1320
01:29:22,834 --> 01:29:24,731
but he's got
unparalleled senses,

1321
01:29:24,736 --> 01:29:25,832
absolutely lethal.

1322
01:29:25,837 --> 01:29:27,906
I've never seen
anything like him...

1323
01:29:27,911 --> 01:29:28,901
in my 300 years.

1324
01:29:28,906 --> 01:29:32,774
And the woman, Victoria,
don't underestimate her.

1325
01:29:37,749 --> 01:29:39,012
I've had to fight
our kind before.

1326
01:29:39,017 --> 01:29:42,043
They're not easy to kill.
- But not impossible.

1327
01:29:42,453 --> 01:29:44,553
We'll tear them apart
and burn the pieces.

1328
01:29:44,622 --> 01:29:46,586
I don't relish the thought
of killing another creature,

1329
01:29:46,591 --> 01:29:49,116
even a sadistic
one like James.

1330
01:29:49,193 --> 01:29:51,036
What if he kills
one of us first?

1331
01:29:51,041 --> 01:29:52,558
I'm gonna run Bella south.

1332
01:29:52,563 --> 01:29:53,793
Can you lead the
tracker away from here?

1333
01:29:53,798 --> 01:29:54,226
No, Edward.

1334
01:29:54,231 --> 01:29:55,795
James knows you would
never leave Bella.

1335
01:29:55,800 --> 01:29:57,825
He'll follow you.
- I'll go with Bella.

1336
01:29:57,902 --> 01:29:59,995
Jasper and I will
drive her south.

1337
01:30:00,071 --> 01:30:01,467
I'll keep her safe, Edward.

1338
01:30:01,472 --> 01:30:04,307
Can you keep your
thoughts to yourself?

1339
01:30:04,312 --> 01:30:06,312
Yes.

1340
01:30:08,379 --> 01:30:10,379
Rosalie, Esme,

1341
01:30:11,349 --> 01:30:12,862
could you put these on...

1342
01:30:12,867 --> 01:30:15,410
so the tracker will
pick up Bella's scent?

1343
01:30:17,689 --> 01:30:20,055
Why? What is she to me?

1344
01:30:20,124 --> 01:30:22,991
Rosalie, Bella is with Edward.

1345
01:30:23,061 --> 01:30:25,427
She's part of this family now,

1346
01:30:26,798 --> 01:30:29,096
and we protect our family.

1347
01:30:46,451 --> 01:30:48,578
Oh, God. If anything...

1348
01:30:48,653 --> 01:30:49,949
What if...

1349
01:30:49,954 --> 01:30:51,818
If anything happens,
I swear to God...

1350
01:30:51,823 --> 01:30:53,823
Nothing's gonna happen.

1351
01:30:53,858 --> 01:30:56,554
There's seven of us,
and there's two of them,

1352
01:30:56,627 --> 01:30:58,301
and when everything's done,

1353
01:30:58,306 --> 01:31:00,306
I'm gonna come
back and get you.

1354
01:31:00,364 --> 01:31:02,261
Yeah.

1355
01:31:02,266 --> 01:31:04,393
Bella, you are my life now.

1356
01:31:22,053 --> 01:31:23,916
Hey, Mom. It's me again.

1357
01:31:23,921 --> 01:31:25,375
You must have let
your phone die...

1358
01:31:25,380 --> 01:31:25,918
or something.

1359
01:31:25,923 --> 01:31:28,444
I'm not in Forks, but
everything's okay,

1360
01:31:28,449 --> 01:31:30,449
and I'll explain it later.

1361
01:31:37,401 --> 01:31:39,401
Rosalie, mark the tree.

1362
01:31:41,572 --> 01:31:43,572
That's good.

1363
01:32:30,121 --> 01:32:32,282
What is it? What do you see?

1364
01:32:44,368 --> 01:32:45,998
He's figured it out.

1365
01:32:46,003 --> 01:32:48,801
The tracker, he just
changed course.

1366
01:32:50,608 --> 01:32:52,338
Where will it take him, Alice?
- Mirrors.

1367
01:32:52,343 --> 01:32:54,343
A room full of mirrors.

1368
01:32:58,616 --> 01:33:01,710
Edward said the visions
weren't always certain.

1369
01:33:01,786 --> 01:33:04,150
She sees the course people
are on while they're on it.

1370
01:33:04,155 --> 01:33:06,319
If they change their minds,
the vision changes.

1371
01:33:06,324 --> 01:33:08,621
Okay, so the course that
the tracker's on now...

1372
01:33:08,626 --> 01:33:11,220
is gonna lead him
to a ballet studio?

1373
01:33:12,029 --> 01:33:15,021
You've been here?
- I took lessons as a kid.

1374
01:33:15,833 --> 01:33:17,763
The school I went to
had an arch just like that.

1375
01:33:17,768 --> 01:33:19,065
Was your school
here in Phoenix?

1376
01:33:19,070 --> 01:33:21,070
Yeah.

1377
01:33:22,073 --> 01:33:24,036
Edward, are you okay?
- We've lost the tracker.

1378
01:33:24,041 --> 01:33:25,671
The woman's still in the area.

1379
01:33:25,676 --> 01:33:27,046
Rosalie and Esme
are going back...

1380
01:33:27,051 --> 01:33:28,341
to Forks to protect
your father.

1381
01:33:28,346 --> 01:33:31,799
I'm coming to get you.
Then you and I...

1382
01:33:31,804 --> 01:33:34,307
are gonna go somewhere alone.

1383
01:33:34,385 --> 01:33:36,115
And the others
will keep hunting.

1384
01:33:36,120 --> 01:33:39,317
I'll do whatever it takes
to make you safe again.

1385
01:33:51,135 --> 01:33:53,399
Hey, Mom, I'm glad
you got my message.

1386
01:33:53,471 --> 01:33:54,734
What are you doing home?

1387
01:33:54,739 --> 01:33:57,367
Bella? Bella? Bella,
where are you?

1388
01:33:58,342 --> 01:34:01,311
Calm down, everything's fine.
- Bella? Bella?

1389
01:34:01,379 --> 01:34:03,813
I'll explain everything later.

1390
01:34:03,915 --> 01:34:05,011
Mom, are you there?

1391
01:34:05,016 --> 01:34:07,163
Forks High School
doesn't protect...

1392
01:34:07,168 --> 01:34:09,148
its students'
privacy very well.

1393
01:34:09,153 --> 01:34:11,496
It was just too easy
for Victoria...

1394
01:34:11,501 --> 01:34:13,501
to find your previous address.

1395
01:34:13,524 --> 01:34:15,958
It's a nice house
you have here.

1396
01:34:16,027 --> 01:34:18,291
I was prepared
to wait for you,

1397
01:34:18,362 --> 01:34:20,971
but then Mom came home
after she received...

1398
01:34:20,976 --> 01:34:22,992
a very worried call
from your dad,

1399
01:34:23,701 --> 01:34:26,135
and it all worked
out quite well.

1400
01:34:26,837 --> 01:34:28,034
Wait, wait...

1401
01:34:28,039 --> 01:34:29,402
Don't touch her. Don't...

1402
01:34:29,407 --> 01:34:31,739
You can still save her.
- Don't.

1403
01:34:31,809 --> 01:34:33,316
But you're gonna
have to get away...

1404
01:34:33,321 --> 01:34:34,073
from your friends.

1405
01:34:34,078 --> 01:34:37,206
Can you handle that?
- Where should I meet you?

1406
01:34:39,216 --> 01:34:41,707
How about your
old ballet studio?

1407
01:34:42,353 --> 01:34:45,254
And I'll know if you
bring anyone along.

1408
01:34:47,191 --> 01:34:48,442
Poor Mommy would...

1409
01:34:48,447 --> 01:34:50,490
pay the price
for that mistake.

1410
01:35:07,410 --> 01:35:10,709
I'd never given much thought
to how I would die.

1411
01:35:11,281 --> 01:35:13,945
But dying in the place
of someone I love...

1412
01:35:13,950 --> 01:35:15,950
seems like a good way to go.

1413
01:35:23,693 --> 01:35:26,210
I can't bring myself to
regret the decisions...

1414
01:35:26,215 --> 01:35:28,357
that brought me
face-to-face with death.

1415
01:35:28,431 --> 01:35:30,797
They also brought
me to Edward.

1416
01:35:59,696 --> 01:36:02,927
Bella? Bella? Bella,
where are you?

1417
01:36:02,999 --> 01:36:04,329
Mom?
- Bella?

1418
01:36:04,334 --> 01:36:05,930
Mom?
- There you are.

1419
01:36:05,935 --> 01:36:07,465
What are you doing in here?

1420
01:36:07,470 --> 01:36:09,529
Everyone makes fun of me.

1421
01:36:10,206 --> 01:36:12,800
Come on, you're a
wonderful dancer.

1422
01:36:12,876 --> 01:36:14,935
Mom, I suck.

1423
01:36:16,346 --> 01:36:18,346
You do not suck.

1424
01:36:28,058 --> 01:36:30,151
That's my favorite part.

1425
01:36:31,061 --> 01:36:33,859
You were a stubborn
child, weren't you?

1426
01:36:35,799 --> 01:36:37,960
She's not even here.
- No.

1427
01:36:40,236 --> 01:36:42,033
Sorry.

1428
01:36:42,038 --> 01:36:45,098
You know, but you really
made it too easy.

1429
01:36:45,175 --> 01:36:48,474
So to make things
more entertaining.

1430
01:36:49,079 --> 01:36:52,310
I'm gonna make a little film
of our time together.

1431
01:36:53,917 --> 01:36:55,930
I borrowed this
from your house.

1432
01:36:55,935 --> 01:36:57,382
I hope you don't mind.

1433
01:36:57,387 --> 01:36:58,616
Good.

1434
01:36:58,621 --> 01:37:00,621
And...

1435
01:37:01,124 --> 01:37:03,124
action.

1436
01:37:04,861 --> 01:37:06,658
That'll break Edward's
little heart.

1437
01:37:06,663 --> 01:37:07,226
You have...

1438
01:37:07,231 --> 01:37:09,094
Edward has nothing
to do with this.

1439
01:37:09,099 --> 01:37:11,099
But he does.

1440
01:37:11,801 --> 01:37:14,463
His rage will make for
more interesting sport...

1441
01:37:14,537 --> 01:37:17,995
than his feeble
attempt to protect you.

1442
01:37:19,309 --> 01:37:21,309
And let's continue.

1443
01:37:36,292 --> 01:37:39,591
Beautiful. Very
visually dynamic.

1444
01:37:42,599 --> 01:37:44,658
I chose my stage well.

1445
01:37:49,839 --> 01:37:53,331
It's too bad he didn't have
the strength to turn you.

1446
01:37:53,676 --> 01:37:56,406
Instead, he kept you
this fragile little human.

1447
01:37:56,479 --> 01:37:58,479
It's cruel, really.

1448
01:38:03,119 --> 01:38:05,451
Tell Edward how much it hurts.

1449
01:38:05,522 --> 01:38:07,185
Tell him to avenge
you. Tell him.

1450
01:38:07,190 --> 01:38:09,988
No, Edward, don't.
- Tell him. Tell him.

1451
01:38:22,739 --> 01:38:23,734
You're alone...

1452
01:38:23,739 --> 01:38:26,197
'cause you're faster
than the others.

1453
01:38:28,511 --> 01:38:30,511
But not stronger.

1454
01:38:31,714 --> 01:38:34,182
I'm strong enough to kill you.

1455
01:38:40,957 --> 01:38:42,957
I'm sorry.

1456
01:39:46,456 --> 01:39:47,585
Bella, Bella, it's okay.

1457
01:39:47,590 --> 01:39:50,024
Son. Enough.

1458
01:39:50,827 --> 01:39:52,827
Remember who you are.

1459
01:39:57,634 --> 01:39:58,930
Bella, you're okay.

1460
01:39:58,935 --> 01:40:00,935
Bella needs you.

1461
01:40:01,004 --> 01:40:02,767
It's okay.

1462
01:40:02,772 --> 01:40:04,772
Oh, God.

1463
01:40:07,910 --> 01:40:09,874
Carlisle? Her blood.

1464
01:40:09,879 --> 01:40:11,178
Your brothers will
take care of him.

1465
01:40:11,183 --> 01:40:11,542
I got him.

1466
01:40:11,547 --> 01:40:12,877
Carlisle.
- Start the fire.

1467
01:40:12,882 --> 01:40:15,612
Get the floorboards.

1468
01:40:15,818 --> 01:40:17,911
Alice.
- Alice, go.

1469
01:40:27,897 --> 01:40:29,044
Her femoral artery's
been severed.

1470
01:40:29,049 --> 01:40:29,994
She's losing too much blood.

1471
01:40:29,999 --> 01:40:32,229
No, no, my head is burning.

1472
01:40:33,736 --> 01:40:35,736
It's the venom.

1473
01:40:36,339 --> 01:40:38,025
You have to make a choice.

1474
01:40:38,030 --> 01:40:40,105
You could let the
change happen.

1475
01:40:40,176 --> 01:40:44,178
No.

1476
01:40:44,714 --> 01:40:46,813
It's gonna happen,
Edward. I've seen it.

1477
01:40:46,818 --> 01:40:48,513
It doesn't have
to be that way.

1478
01:40:48,518 --> 01:40:49,699
She's still hemorrhaging.

1479
01:40:49,704 --> 01:40:51,549
Alice, make me a
tourniquet. Your belt.

1480
01:40:51,554 --> 01:40:53,852
Carlisle, what's
my other option?

1481
01:40:55,124 --> 01:40:57,251
Tie it above my hands.

1482
01:40:57,327 --> 01:40:59,327
Carlisle.

1483
01:41:00,630 --> 01:41:02,630
Go.

1484
01:41:06,469 --> 01:41:07,958
We could try to
suck the venom out.

1485
01:41:07,963 --> 01:41:09,367
You know I won't
be able to stop.

1486
01:41:09,372 --> 01:41:11,567
Then find the will to stop.

1487
01:41:12,508 --> 01:41:14,005
But choose.

1488
01:41:14,010 --> 01:41:16,205
She only has minutes left.

1489
01:41:18,381 --> 01:41:20,906
I'm gonna make it
go away, Bella.

1490
01:41:23,252 --> 01:41:25,277
I'm gonna make it go away.

1491
01:41:43,639 --> 01:41:44,501
Edward, stop.

1492
01:41:44,506 --> 01:41:47,097
Her blood is clean.
You're killing her.

1493
01:41:47,844 --> 01:41:49,674
Edward.

1494
01:41:49,679 --> 01:41:51,679
Stop.

1495
01:41:52,014 --> 01:41:54,014
Stop.

1496
01:41:54,751 --> 01:41:56,751
Find the will.

1497
01:42:20,877 --> 01:42:24,074
Death is peaceful, easy.

1498
01:42:31,487 --> 01:42:33,487
Life is harder.

1499
01:42:38,693 --> 01:42:40,693
Bella?

1500
01:42:41,997 --> 01:42:43,997
Baby?

1501
01:42:44,833 --> 01:42:46,833
Bella.

1502
01:42:47,903 --> 01:42:49,903
Mom?
- Hey.

1503
01:42:50,071 --> 01:42:51,668
Where is he?

1504
01:42:51,673 --> 01:42:53,603
Where's...

1505
01:42:53,608 --> 01:42:55,172
Where's Edward?

1506
01:42:55,177 --> 01:42:57,177
He's asleep.

1507
01:42:57,879 --> 01:42:59,209
He never leaves.

1508
01:42:59,214 --> 01:43:02,240
And your dad, he's
down at the cafeteria.

1509
01:43:02,751 --> 01:43:04,751
What happened?

1510
01:43:04,953 --> 01:43:07,820
Well, when you fell,
you broke your leg,

1511
01:43:08,824 --> 01:43:11,349
and you lost a lot of blood.

1512
01:43:11,426 --> 01:43:14,190
You don't remember
any of this, do you?

1513
01:43:15,764 --> 01:43:17,527
Edward came down
with his dad...

1514
01:43:17,532 --> 01:43:19,966
to try to convince you
to come back to Forks.

1515
01:43:20,035 --> 01:43:22,231
So you went over
to their hotel,

1516
01:43:22,236 --> 01:43:23,467
then you tripped,

1517
01:43:23,472 --> 01:43:26,236
and you fell down two
flights of stairs.

1518
01:43:26,908 --> 01:43:28,908
Went through a window.

1519
01:43:35,016 --> 01:43:36,947
Yeah, that sounds like me.

1520
01:43:36,952 --> 01:43:39,079
Oh, honey, I'm so sorry.

1521
01:43:43,024 --> 01:43:45,024
It's Phil.

1522
01:43:45,026 --> 01:43:47,085
He's so worried about you.

1523
01:43:48,497 --> 01:43:49,960
You're texting.

1524
01:43:49,965 --> 01:43:51,965
Finally, yeah.

1525
01:43:53,602 --> 01:43:55,695
I told him to stay
down in Florida.

1526
01:43:55,770 --> 01:43:58,407
Honey, you are gonna
love Jacksonville.

1527
01:43:58,412 --> 01:43:59,903
It's sunny every day,

1528
01:43:59,908 --> 01:44:01,419
and we found the
cutest little house,

1529
01:44:01,424 --> 01:44:02,772
and you've got
your own bathroom.

1530
01:44:02,777 --> 01:44:05,371
Mom, I still want
to live in Forks.

1531
01:44:05,981 --> 01:44:07,611
What?

1532
01:44:07,616 --> 01:44:09,616
I want to live in Forks.

1533
01:44:09,985 --> 01:44:12,613
Well, okay, but
we'll talk about it.

1534
01:44:14,089 --> 01:44:16,089
Do you mind getting Dad?

1535
01:44:16,791 --> 01:44:19,783
I have to talk to
him. Apologize.

1536
01:44:20,395 --> 01:44:22,625
Okay, baby. I'll go get him.

1537
01:44:23,565 --> 01:44:26,398
And I'll go get a nurse, okay?
- Okay.

1538
01:44:38,213 --> 01:44:40,213
So what happened?

1539
01:44:40,215 --> 01:44:42,215
Where's James?

1540
01:44:42,951 --> 01:44:44,951
We took care of it.

1541
01:44:51,426 --> 01:44:54,054
And the woman,
Victoria, she ran off.

1542
01:44:54,596 --> 01:44:56,596
I'm alive because of you.

1543
01:44:56,631 --> 01:44:59,099
No, you're in here
because of me.

1544
01:45:00,769 --> 01:45:03,533
The worst part of it was that

1545
01:45:04,639 --> 01:45:07,369
I thought I wasn't
gonna be able to stop.

1546
01:45:07,442 --> 01:45:09,442
You did stop.

1547
01:45:10,712 --> 01:45:13,146
Bella, you gotta go
to Jacksonville...

1548
01:45:13,151 --> 01:45:15,151
so I can't hurt you anymore.

1549
01:45:16,651 --> 01:45:18,651
What?

1550
01:45:20,989 --> 01:45:23,082
Are you... No.

1551
01:45:23,158 --> 01:45:25,158
No.

1552
01:45:26,227 --> 01:45:28,024
I don't even know
what you're... How...

1553
01:45:28,029 --> 01:45:29,309
What are you talking about?

1554
01:45:29,314 --> 01:45:30,927
You want me to go
away? I can't...

1555
01:45:30,932 --> 01:45:33,457
No, I can't... I can't
just leave you...

1556
01:45:33,535 --> 01:45:35,535
I know.

1557
01:45:36,771 --> 01:45:38,468
We can't be apart.

1558
01:45:38,473 --> 01:45:40,473
You can't leave me.

1559
01:45:40,842 --> 01:45:42,842
I'm here.

1560
01:45:45,714 --> 01:45:47,611
Okay, just don't...

1561
01:45:47,616 --> 01:45:50,847
You just can't say stuff
like that to me. Ever.

1562
01:45:55,357 --> 01:45:57,848
Where else am I gonna go?

1563
01:46:47,609 --> 01:46:50,271
Alice lent me the dress.

1564
01:46:50,345 --> 01:46:52,345
The cast is...

1565
01:46:52,914 --> 01:46:54,914
You're perfect.

1566
01:46:57,252 --> 01:46:59,550
I'll take care of
her, Chief Swan.

1567
01:47:00,455 --> 01:47:02,455
I've heard that before.

1568
01:47:06,561 --> 01:47:08,561
All right, Bells.

1569
01:47:10,465 --> 01:47:13,093
I put a new can of pepper
spray in your bag.

1570
01:47:13,168 --> 01:47:14,798
Dad.

1571
01:47:14,803 --> 01:47:16,803
And...

1572
01:47:18,106 --> 01:47:20,540
Well, you look beautiful.

1573
01:47:22,677 --> 01:47:24,677
Thanks.

1574
01:47:25,680 --> 01:47:27,680
See you.

1575
01:47:34,055 --> 01:47:37,047
Hey. I'll be right back.

1576
01:47:39,561 --> 01:47:41,561
Bella.
- Jacob.

1577
01:47:42,163 --> 01:47:44,163
Hey.

1578
01:47:44,232 --> 01:47:46,427
Nice.
- You, too.

1579
01:47:47,168 --> 01:47:49,356
Are you crashing the
prom or something?

1580
01:47:49,361 --> 01:47:50,834
Did you come with a date?

1581
01:47:50,839 --> 01:47:52,839
No.

1582
01:47:55,944 --> 01:47:58,538
My dad paid me to
come talk to you.

1583
01:47:59,147 --> 01:48:00,877
Twenty bucks.

1584
01:48:00,882 --> 01:48:02,882
Let's hear it.

1585
01:48:03,384 --> 01:48:05,409
Just don't get mad, okay?

1586
01:48:06,988 --> 01:48:09,980
He wants you to break up
with your boyfriend.

1587
01:48:10,325 --> 01:48:13,988
It's just, he said, quote,

1588
01:48:14,829 --> 01:48:16,829
'We'll be watching you. '

1589
01:48:18,399 --> 01:48:20,689
Okay, well, tell
him, 'Thanks. '

1590
01:48:20,694 --> 01:48:21,531
Okay.

1591
01:48:21,536 --> 01:48:24,630
And to pay up.
- Okay. Let me help you.

1592
01:48:24,706 --> 01:48:26,603
Jacob.

1593
01:48:26,608 --> 01:48:28,608
I'll take it from here.

1594
01:48:31,679 --> 01:48:34,170
Guess I'll see
you around, Bella.

1595
01:48:35,917 --> 01:48:37,917
All right.

1596
01:48:44,292 --> 01:48:46,474
I leave you alone
for two minutes,

1597
01:48:46,479 --> 01:48:48,479
and the wolves descend.

1598
01:48:54,969 --> 01:48:57,173
I can't believe you're
making me do this.

1599
01:48:57,178 --> 01:48:59,178
Just smile.

1600
01:49:04,045 --> 01:49:10,917
Tonight. Lightning Strikes.

1601
01:49:12,086 --> 01:49:18,389
Don't go stay tonight.

1602
01:49:18,459 --> 01:49:21,451
Wow. You are really
trying to kill me.

1603
01:49:21,529 --> 01:49:23,969
The prom is an important
rite of passage.

1604
01:49:23,974 --> 01:49:26,057
I didn't want you
to miss anything.

1605
01:49:26,134 --> 01:49:28,134
Oh.

1606
01:49:42,150 --> 01:49:45,017
Everyday we're
going all the way

1607
01:49:45,086 --> 01:49:51,787
Everyday, everyday, everyday
we're going all the way

1608
01:49:51,860 --> 01:49:54,192
Tonight. Lightning Strikes.

1609
01:49:54,262 --> 01:49:56,262
Bella, hey.

1610
01:49:58,800 --> 01:50:00,800
Do you want to go?
- Yeah.

1611
01:50:00,969 --> 01:50:03,267
All right, slowing it down.

1612
01:50:09,244 --> 01:50:11,244
Shall we?

1613
01:50:11,912 --> 01:50:13,912
You're serious?

1614
01:50:14,648 --> 01:50:16,478
Why not.

1615
01:50:16,483 --> 01:50:19,850
Wide on my plastic toys

1616
01:50:19,920 --> 01:50:24,687
Then when the cops
closed the fair

1617
01:50:24,758 --> 01:50:28,922
I cut my long baby hair

1618
01:50:28,996 --> 01:50:31,556
Stole me a dog-eared map

1619
01:50:31,632 --> 01:50:33,632
See, you're dancing.

1620
01:50:34,935 --> 01:50:36,935
At prom.

1621
01:50:39,339 --> 01:50:44,402
Have I found you

1622
01:50:44,478 --> 01:50:49,074
Flightless bird

1623
01:50:49,149 --> 01:50:53,711
Jealous

1624
01:50:53,787 --> 01:50:57,245
Weeping

1625
01:50:57,324 --> 01:50:59,758
Edward, why did you save me?

1626
01:50:59,826 --> 01:51:02,294
If you just let
the venom spread.

1627
01:51:02,863 --> 01:51:05,058
I could be like you by now.

1628
01:51:06,867 --> 01:51:09,392
You don't know what
you're saying.

1629
01:51:10,270 --> 01:51:12,670
You don't want this.
- I want you.

1630
01:51:12,739 --> 01:51:14,739
Always.

1631
01:51:19,680 --> 01:51:22,274
I'm not gonna end
your life for you.

1632
01:51:22,349 --> 01:51:24,840
I'm dying already.

1633
01:51:26,753 --> 01:51:28,983
Every second, I get closer.

1634
01:51:29,623 --> 01:51:31,486
Older.

1635
01:51:31,491 --> 01:51:33,982
That's the way it's
supposed to be.

1636
01:51:34,895 --> 01:51:37,386
Alice said that she
saw me like you.

1637
01:51:37,464 --> 01:51:39,796
I heard her.
- Her visions change.

1638
01:51:39,866 --> 01:51:42,357
Yeah, based on what
people decide.

1639
01:51:43,103 --> 01:51:45,103
I've decided.

1640
01:51:48,075 --> 01:51:50,566
So that's what
you dream about.

1641
01:51:50,644 --> 01:51:52,644
Becoming a monster.

1642
01:51:55,983 --> 01:51:58,884
I dream about being
with you forever.

1643
01:51:58,952 --> 01:52:00,952
Forever?

1644
01:52:05,425 --> 01:52:07,552
And you're ready right now?

1645
01:52:09,596 --> 01:52:10,859
Yes.

1646
01:52:10,864 --> 01:52:17,827
Bleeding or lost you

1647
01:52:17,904 --> 01:52:22,466
American mouth

1648
01:52:22,542 --> 01:52:27,775
Big pill

1649
01:52:27,848 --> 01:52:29,223
Is it not enough...

1650
01:52:29,228 --> 01:52:32,342
just to have a long
and happy life with me?

1651
01:52:39,960 --> 01:52:41,960
Yeah.

1652
01:52:42,662 --> 01:52:44,662
For now.

1653
01:53:12,559 --> 01:53:14,925
No one will surrender tonight,

1654
01:53:16,029 --> 01:53:18,029
but I won't give in.

1655
01:53:19,199 --> 01:53:21,199
I know what I want.

1656
01:53:27,174 --> 01:53:32,271
Have I found you

1657
01:53:32,345 --> 01:53:36,873
Flightless bird

1658
01:53:36,950 --> 01:53:41,546
Grounded

1659
01:53:41,621 --> 01:53:48,584
Bleeding or lost you

1660
01:53:52,365 --> 01:53:54,560
American mouth...

1661
01:54:03,777 --> 01:54:06,974
How come I end up
where I started

1662
01:54:07,047 --> 01:54:10,073
How come I end up
where I went wrong

1663
01:54:10,150 --> 01:54:13,347
Won't take my eyes
off the ball again

1664
01:54:13,420 --> 01:54:16,617
You reel me out then
you cut the string

1665
01:54:22,796 --> 01:54:25,890
How come I end up
where I started

1666
01:54:25,966 --> 01:54:28,935
How come I end up
where I went wrong

1667
01:54:29,002 --> 01:54:31,937
Won't take my eyes
off the ball again

1668
01:54:32,005 --> 01:54:35,839
First you reel me out
and then you cut the string

1669
01:54:47,888 --> 01:54:51,085
You used to be all right

1670
01:54:51,158 --> 01:54:53,820
What happened?

1671
01:54:53,894 --> 01:55:00,163
Did the cat get your tongue

1672
01:55:00,233 --> 01:55:07,002
Did your string come undone

1673
01:55:07,073 --> 01:55:18,750
One by one

1674
01:55:18,818 --> 01:55:25,348
It comes to us all

1675
01:55:25,425 --> 01:55:32,331
It's as soft as your pillow...

1676
01:56:15,842 --> 01:56:18,470
I dreamed I was missing

1677
01:56:18,545 --> 01:56:21,605
You were so scared

1678
01:56:21,681 --> 01:56:24,445
But no one would listen...

1679
01:56:24,517 --> 01:56:27,953
'Cause no one else cared

1680
01:56:28,021 --> 01:56:30,512
After my dreaming

1681
01:56:30,590 --> 01:56:33,957
I woke with this fear

1682
01:56:34,027 --> 01:56:36,427
What am I leaving

1683
01:56:36,496 --> 01:56:39,624
When I'm done here?

1684
01:56:39,699 --> 01:56:42,133
So if you're asking me

1685
01:56:42,202 --> 01:56:46,036
I want you to know

1686
01:56:46,106 --> 01:56:48,165
When my time comes

1687
01:56:48,241 --> 01:56:51,335
Forget the wrong
that I've done

1688
01:56:51,411 --> 01:56:54,209
Help me leave behind some

1689
01:56:54,281 --> 01:56:58,047
Reasons to be missed

1690
01:56:58,118 --> 01:57:00,245
Don't resent me

1691
01:57:00,320 --> 01:57:03,255
And when you're feeling empty

1692
01:57:03,323 --> 01:57:06,190
Keep me in your memory

1693
01:57:06,259 --> 01:57:11,954
Leave out all the rest

1694
01:57:12,032 --> 01:57:14,899
Forgetting all the hurt inside

1695
01:57:14,968 --> 01:57:17,903
You've learned to hide so well

1696
01:57:17,971 --> 01:57:20,804
Pretending someone
else can come

1697
01:57:20,874 --> 01:57:23,934
And save me from myself

1698
01:57:24,010 --> 01:57:28,003
I can't be who you are

1699
01:57:28,081 --> 01:57:30,174
When my time comes

1700
01:57:30,250 --> 01:57:33,276
Forget the wrong
that I've done

1701
01:57:33,353 --> 01:57:36,322
Help me leave behind some

1702
01:57:36,389 --> 01:57:40,052
Reasons to be missed

1703
01:57:40,126 --> 01:57:42,126
Don't resent me

1704
01:57:42,162 --> 01:57:45,290
And when you're feeling empty

1705
01:57:45,364 --> 01:57:48,026
Keep me in your memory

1706
01:57:48,100 --> 01:57:53,930
Leave out all the rest

1707
01:57:54,006 --> 01:57:56,770
Forgetting all the hurt inside

1708
01:57:56,842 --> 01:57:59,902
You've learned to hide so well

1709
01:57:59,978 --> 01:58:02,674
Pretending someone
else can come

1710
01:58:02,748 --> 01:58:05,945
And save me from myself

1711
01:58:06,018 --> 01:58:11,888
I can't be who you are

1712
01:58:11,957 --> 01:58:16,394
I can't be who you are...

1713
01:58:24,303 --> 01:58:27,136
How can I decide what's right

1714
01:58:27,206 --> 01:58:30,403
When you're
clouding up my mind

1715
01:58:30,476 --> 01:58:33,639
I can't win your losing fight

1716
01:58:33,712 --> 01:58:35,712
All the time

1717
01:58:35,781 --> 01:58:38,875
How can I ever own what's mine

1718
01:58:38,951 --> 01:58:41,977
When you're always
taking sides

1719
01:58:42,054 --> 01:58:44,989
But you won't take
away my pride

1720
01:58:45,057 --> 01:58:58,326
No, not this time

1721
01:58:59,104 --> 01:59:01,766
How did we get here?

1722
01:59:01,840 --> 01:59:08,803
When I used to
know you so well

1723
01:59:10,749 --> 01:59:13,650
But how did we get here?

1724
01:59:13,719 --> 01:59:20,648
I think I know

1725
01:59:28,534 --> 01:59:31,662
The truth is hiding
in your eyes

1726
01:59:31,737 --> 01:59:34,797
And its hanging on your tongue

1727
01:59:34,873 --> 01:59:37,239
Just boiling in my blood

1728
01:59:37,309 --> 01:59:39,971
But you think that I can't see

1729
01:59:40,045 --> 01:59:43,344
What kind of man that you are

1730
01:59:43,415 --> 01:59:46,441
If you're a man at all

1731
01:59:46,518 --> 01:59:53,424
Well, I will figure
this one out on my own

1732
01:59:54,860 --> 02:00:00,298
I'm screaming I love you so

1733
02:00:00,365 --> 02:00:03,300
My thoughts you can't decode

1734
02:00:03,368 --> 02:00:06,303
How did we get here?

1735
02:00:06,371 --> 02:00:13,334
When I used to
know you so well

1736
02:00:13,412 --> 02:00:17,678
Yeah But how did we get here?

1737
02:00:17,749 --> 02:00:24,712
Well, I think I know how

1738
02:00:37,202 --> 02:00:42,868
Do you see what we've done

1739
02:00:42,941 --> 02:00:48,743
We're gonna make such
fools of ourselves

1740
02:00:50,249 --> 02:00:53,116
How did we get here?

1741
02:00:53,185 --> 02:00:57,747
When I used to
know you so well

1742
02:00:57,823 --> 02:01:01,782
Yeah, yeah, yeah

1743
02:01:01,860 --> 02:01:04,727
How did we get here?

1744
02:01:04,796 --> 02:01:11,759
When I used to
know you so well

1745
02:01:11,837 --> 02:01:16,001
I think I know

1746
02:01:19,244 --> 02:01:25,046
There is something
I see in you

1747
02:01:25,117 --> 02:01:27,813
It might kill me

1748
02:01:27,886 --> 02:01:34,223
I want it to be true
