How are we doing on that?
Do we have an interpreter?

72
00:05:11,276 --> 00:05:14,280
But I understand that you
speak a little English.

73
00:05:14,363 --> 00:05:17,162
- Yes.
- You do?

74
00:05:17,241 --> 00:05:20,745
I hope you don't mind if I eat while
we talk. I've a bit of bad news.

75
00:05:20,828 --> 00:05:23,832
Your country has suspended
all traveling privileges

76
00:05:23,914 --> 00:05:26,667
on passports issued
by your government.

77
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:29,799
And our State Department
has revoked the visa

78
00:05:29,878 --> 00:05:32,347
that was going to allow
you to enter the U.S.

79
00:05:32,422 --> 00:05:35,096
That's it in a nutshell, basically.

80
00:05:35,175 --> 00:05:39,726
While you were in the air, there was
a military coup in your country.

81
00:05:39,805 --> 00:05:42,900
Most of the dead were members
of the Presidential Guard.

82
00:05:42,975 --> 00:05:45,603
They were attacked in the
middle of the night.

83
00:05:45,686 --> 00:05:47,939
They got it all on GHN, I think.

84
00:05:48,021 --> 00:05:51,400
There were few civilian casualties.
I'm sure your family's fine.

85
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:55,575
Mr. Navorski, your country
was annexed from the inside.

86
00:05:55,654 --> 00:05:58,203
The Republic of Krakozhia
is under new leadership.

87
00:05:58,282 --> 00:06:01,286
Krakozhia! Krakozhia.

88
00:06:02,953 --> 00:06:08,710
- Krakozhia.
- Right. I don't think he gets it.

89
00:06:09,418 --> 00:06:12,046
Let me... Look.

90
00:06:12,129 --> 00:06:15,258
Imagine that these potato
chips are Krakozhia.

91
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:20,892
- Krakozhia. Yes. Okay.
- Krakozhia.

92
00:06:21,972 --> 00:06:24,896
So the potato chips are Krakozhia.

93
00:06:24,975 --> 00:06:28,855
- And this apple...
- Big Apple.

94
00:06:28,937 --> 00:06:34,239
Big Apple represents the
Liberty Rebels. Okay?

95
00:06:35,736 --> 00:06:38,364
No more Krakozhia. Okay?

96
00:06:38,447 --> 00:06:43,203
New government.
Revolution. You understand?

97
00:06:43,285 --> 00:06:46,755
All the flights in and out of
your country have been suspended.

98
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:50,926
The new government has sealed all
borders, so your visa's no longer valid.

99
00:06:51,001 --> 00:06:54,801
So, currently, you are
a citizen of nowhere.

100
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,757
Now, we can't process
you new papers

101
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:02,813
until the U.S. recognizes your country's
new diplomatic reclassification.

102
00:07:02,888 --> 00:07:05,437
You don't qualify for
asylum, refugee status,

103
00:07:05,515 --> 00:07:08,394
temporary protective status,
humanitarian parole

104
00:07:08,477 --> 00:07:12,732
or non-immigration work travel.
You don't qualify for any of these.

105
00:07:12,814 --> 00:07:15,192
You are at this time simply...

106
00:07:17,152 --> 00:07:20,782
- unacceptable.
- Unacceptable.

107
00:07:20,864 --> 00:07:23,117
- Unacceptable.
- Unacceptable.

108
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,454

Brooklyn Bridge,

109
00:07:26,536 --> 00:07:30,086

110
00:07:30,165 --> 00:07:33,419
I got more bad news
for you. Cats has closed.

111
00:07:33,877 --> 00:07:35,345
Okay. Okay.

112
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:38,469
Now I go New York City. Thank you.

113
00:07:38,548 --> 00:07:42,849
No, Mr. Navorski. I cannot allow you to
enter the United States at this time.

114
00:07:42,928 --> 00:07:46,307
- Krakozhia.
- We can't allow you to go home either.

115
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:50,236
You don't really have a home.
Technically, it doesn't exist.

Here's my dilemma, Mr. Navorski.

123

and I have no right to detain you.

124

You have fallen through
a crack in the system.

125
00:08:18,964 --> 00:08:22,889
- I am crack.
- Yes. Until we get this sorted out,

126
00:08:22,968 --> 00:08:27,144
I will allow you to enter the
International Transit Lounge.

127
00:08:27,222 --> 00:08:30,897

some very good news for you.

What?

525
00:44:00,019 --> 00:44:03,398
I've figured out a way to get
you out of this airport.

526
00:44:03,481 --> 00:44:05,154
How?

527
00:44:05,233 --> 00:44:09,409
Well, we have laws here
that protect aliens

528
00:44:09,487 --> 00:44:13,162
who have a credible fear of
returning to their own country.

529
00:44:13,241 --> 00:44:15,619
If we can establish
this fear with you,

530
00:44:15,702 --> 00:44:21,254
then the CBP will be forced to begin
Expedited Removal Procedures,

531
00:44:21,332 --> 00:44:27,135
to bring you to an immigration judge and
let you plead your case for asylum.

532
00:44:27,213 --> 00:44:29,432
Asylum.

533
00:44:29,507 --> 00:44:34,604
Unfortunately, the courts are
so backed up with asylum cases

534
00:44:34,679 --> 00:44:39,526
that the soonest you'd get before a
judge would be six months from now.

535
00:44:39,601 --> 00:44:43,356
Yes, and we would have no choice

536
00:44:43,438 --> 00:44:48,615
but to let you go for those six months.
It's the law. You'd be released.

537
00:44:48,693 --> 00:44:51,537
You would be free to wait in New
York until your court date.

538
00:44:51,613 --> 00:44:56,915
But, believe it or not, most people
never show up before the judge.

539
00:44:57,452 --> 00:45:01,377
- So I go New York City?
- Uh-huh.

540
00:45:01,456 --> 00:45:03,800
You can go to New
York City tonight.

541
00:45:03,875 --> 00:45:08,096
But you only get to go if we
can establish a credible fear.

542
00:45:08,671 --> 00:45:12,266
- Fear?
- Mmm-hmm. Fear.

543
00:45:12,342 --> 00:45:16,472
- From what?
- That's the best part.

544
00:45:16,554 --> 00:45:21,060
It doesn't matter what you're afraid of.
It's all the same to Uncle Sam.

545
00:45:21,142 --> 00:45:23,565
So I'm going to ask
you one question.

546
00:45:23,645 --> 00:45:27,991
If you give me the correct answer,
I can get you out of this airport tonight.

After he loses the
Battle of Waterloo,

781

Napoleon isolates himself on the
tiny island of Saint Helena.

what happens next,

783

but the version
I like goes like this.

784
01:01:53,383 --> 01:01:56,762
He's very depressed and
decides to take his own life.

785
01:01:57,554 --> 01:02:01,604
But Napoleon believes himself to
be of such superhuman strength

786
01:02:01,683 --> 01:02:05,608
that he takes six times the amount
of poison needed to do the job.

787
01:02:05,687 --> 01:02:10,409
His stomach is so full up with
poison that his body rejects it,

788
01:02:10,484 --> 01:02:12,236
and he doesn't die.

789
01:02:12,319 --> 01:02:15,664
See? Ego. Saved his life.

790
01:02:15,739 --> 01:02:17,787

791

- Yes. To read words on bottle.

- Yeah, tell us. Who was it?

Who was this man?

987
01:15:05,049 --> 01:15:09,179
Navorski. Viktor
"The Goat" Navorski.

988
01:15:37,832 --> 01:15:41,837
- It doesn't look good, Frank.
- I was just following the rules.

989
01:15:41,919 --> 01:15:46,720
Sometimes you have to ignore the
rules and concentrate on the people.

990
01:15:46,799 --> 01:15:48,051
The people, I know.

991
01:15:48,134 --> 01:15:51,980
The people, compassion. That's
the foundation of this country.

992
01:15:54,265 --> 01:15:56,859
You could learn something
from Navorski.

993
01:15:58,811 --> 01:16:01,860
Cheer up. It's not over yet.

997

- A promise in the can?
- Yes. A promise.

1005

Let me make you a promise, Viktor.

1006
01:17:10,550 --> 01:17:14,145
And this is a promise that comes
from a man who is stuck here.

1007
01:17:14,220 --> 01:17:17,190
A man who may be stuck here
for the next ten years.

You will not set one

Not a single toe in the

I am saying to you?

Yes.

We don't have to do this, Viktor.
I can ship you out in a crate.

1017
01:18:23,623 --> 01:18:25,921
I can mail you anywhere in the U.S.

1018

What about my food cart? He can
hide inside, and we'll drive out.

1019
01:18:29,462 --> 01:18:33,558
- No. I can't do this.
- You said you wanted us to help you.

a way out, not a way in.

Be careful. Those flight attendants
ain't like regular women.

1024

Flying back and forth
between time zones

1025

Bite to eat. Bite to eat.

1044
01:20:58,861 --> 01:21:01,956
- What did you say?
- You been ever married?

1045
01:21:02,031 --> 01:21:07,913
I had a wife and two kids in India.
I left them there 23 years ago.

1046
01:21:07,995 --> 01:21:09,713
Why?

1047
01:21:10,498 --> 01:21:14,719
I had a small tobacco
shop in Madras.

1048
01:21:14,794 --> 01:21:17,172
Made just enough money to survive.

1049
01:21:17,254 --> 01:21:22,385
One day this policeman comes in
and tells me I owe him some tax.

1050
01:21:22,468 --> 01:21:26,814
I said okay. This is common.
So I pay him.

1051
01:21:26,889 --> 01:21:31,736
The next day, the same policeman come
and keep coming and keep coming.

1052
01:21:31,811 --> 01:21:35,782
And I am paying, and I'm paying him,
and I'm paying him, and I'm paying him.

1053
01:21:35,856 --> 01:21:41,454
And finally, on the fifth day, I take
a knife and I stab him in his chest.

1054
01:21:42,154 --> 01:21:45,954
- You killed policeman?
- No. I just missed his heart.

1055
01:21:46,992 --> 01:21:49,495
When they tried to arrest me,
I run away.

1056
01:21:50,121 --> 01:21:52,749
So you never go home?

1057
01:21:52,832 --> 01:21:57,463
If I go home, I go in the
jail for seven years.

What if United States
catch you? They deport you.

1059

As long as I keep my floor
clean, keep my head down,

1319
01:45:33,084 --> 01:45:36,088
Hello, Dolores. How I am today?

1320
01:45:37,755 --> 01:45:39,803
What do you have here?

1321
01:45:44,053 --> 01:45:46,055
What do you have here?

1322
01:45:55,898 --> 01:45:57,946
Oh, no. It's not signed.

1323
01:45:59,569 --> 01:46:01,321
What?

1324
01:46:01,404 --> 01:46:04,203
This is a one-day
emergency travel visa.

1325
01:46:04,282 --> 01:46:08,913
To validate authenticity, it needs to
be signed by the supervising officer.

1326
01:46:09,412 --> 01:46:10,664
Dixon?

1327
01:46:11,747 --> 01:46:12,873
Yes.

1328

1329
01:46:19,005 --> 01:46:22,976
The war in my country is over.

1330
01:46:24,176 --> 01:46:27,806
Yeah. I know. Congratulations.

1331
01:46:29,181 --> 01:46:31,183
It's strange, isn't it, Viktor?

1332
01:46:32,310 --> 01:46:34,654
When you wait so
long for one thing?

1333
01:46:35,897 --> 01:46:38,116
One tiny moment.

1334
01:46:38,190 --> 01:46:40,909
I had that moment today, too.

1335
01:46:40,985 --> 01:46:43,158
You see this badge?

1336
01:46:43,237 --> 01:46:47,083
This badge means that I was
made CBP Field Commissioner.

1337
01:46:47,158 --> 01:46:52,164
It means that my authority over the
security of this airport is absolute.

1338

1339

1340

Officer Waylin, please show
Mr. Navorski into the terminal

1341
01:47:08,804 --> 01:47:11,728
and make sure he does
not miss his flight.

1342
01:47:11,807 --> 01:47:14,151
Goodbye, Viktor, and good luck.

1343
01:47:24,320 --> 01:47:26,698
I think I want go New York City.

1344
01:47:28,866 --> 01:47:30,960
Don't make this difficult, Viktor.

1345
01:47:31,035 --> 01:47:33,129
I no more "unacceptable."

1346
01:47:34,038 --> 01:47:37,463
- I told you this is over.
- I go New York.

1347
01:47:40,211 --> 01:47:42,634
Are you sure you want to do that?

1348
01:47:43,965 --> 01:47:45,967
I go New York City now.

1349
01:47:50,930 --> 01:47:56,312
Part of my job is to get rid of
undesirables, and there are quite a few.

1350
01:47:57,561 --> 01:48:00,280
Like this guy, Joe Mulroy.
I think you know him.

1351
01:48:00,356 --> 01:48:04,406
He's been here for 20 years, but he's
been running an after-hour poker game.

1352
01:48:04,485 --> 01:48:06,704
Bringing in liquor and marijuana.

1353
01:48:06,779 --> 01:48:10,829
Poor guy's going to lose his pension.
And I think he has kids, too.

1354
01:48:10,908 --> 01:48:12,000
Yep.

1355
01:48:12,076 --> 01:48:16,957
And then there's this guy, Enrique Cruz.
I think you also know Enrique.

1356
01:48:17,039 --> 01:48:22,011
Enrique has been letting people
into the food preparation area.

1357
01:48:22,086 --> 01:48:24,009
That's a major security breach.

1358
01:48:24,088 --> 01:48:26,182
The poor guy,
I think he's a newlywed.

1359
01:48:26,257 --> 01:48:28,351
But I'm going to
have to let him go.

1360
01:48:28,426 --> 01:48:33,148
And then there's Gupta
Rajan. He's a janitor.

1361
01:48:33,222 --> 01:48:37,853
But he's wanted for assaulting a
police officer back in India in 1979.

1362
01:48:39,228 --> 01:48:41,356
I'll have to deport him.

1363
01:48:41,439 --> 01:48:43,441
I will go home.

1364
01:48:44,400 --> 01:48:48,155
- I'm sorry. What did you say?
- I will go home.

1365
01:48:48,237 --> 01:48:50,239
Leave them alone. I will go.

1366
01:48:50,948 --> 01:48:52,541
- Today.
- Yes.

1367
01:48:52,616 --> 01:48:55,870
If you don't get on that
plane, they're all gone.

1368

- Do you understand?
- Yes.

1369
01:48:57,830 --> 01:48:59,332
Okay. Good.

1370
01:49:13,345 --> 01:49:14,597
I don't believe you.

1371
01:49:14,680 --> 01:49:18,401
- Viktor, you don't have to do this.
- You can fight these guys.

1372
01:49:18,476 --> 01:49:21,320
- We'll help you.
- Viktor, come on. I owe you so much.

1373
01:49:21,395 --> 01:49:24,069
- Please let me help you.
- This is your friend talking.

1374
01:49:24,148 --> 01:49:26,651
We're all your friends.
We're your family now.

You try to fool us.

1378
01:49:37,953 --> 01:49:42,504
You make us to think you would walk
out, that you will fight with them.

1379
01:49:42,583 --> 01:49:44,335
Why don't you fight?

1380
01:49:44,877 --> 01:49:49,132
- The war is over.
- Then go. Get lost.

1381

them you never made it.
