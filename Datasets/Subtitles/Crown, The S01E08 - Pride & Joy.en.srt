1
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:37,760
-Ask my daughters to come and see me.
-Yes, ma'am.

2
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:47,120
Girls, it's too soon. I can't do it.

3
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,040
I'm not strong enough.

4
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,400
That's why you have
two grown-up daughters.

5
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,400
To step in for you
in situations like this. I'll do it.

6
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,880
Thank you but that makes no sense.

7
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:02,160
The speech is for Papa about Papa.
I would like to do it.

8
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:03,960
It's right I do it.

9
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:07,440
You don't enjoy public speaking,
whereas I do.

10
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:11,640
-And I was Pa...
-What? Favorite?

11
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:17,440
- Are you going to deny it?
- Your father didn't have a favorite.

12
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:23,560
He adored you both.
Did so equally. As any good father would.

13
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,800
Mummy, you decide, then.
As head of the family.

14
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:34,520
But she's not head of the family. I am.
And I will make the speech.

15
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,440
-Ma'am.
-Thank you.

16
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,600
Thank you.

17
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:02,600
Six years ago, I heard the moving words
which my father spoke

18
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:06,520
when he unveiled the statue
of King George V.

19
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:10,640
I did not think then
that in so short a time,

20
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,120
I should be called to take his place.

21
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,480
But, it is with pride
that I unveil this noble statue today.

22
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,960
Ma'am...

23
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,440
We have been flagging our concern
for some time.

24
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:58,920
These latest events, internationally,
merely strengthen our view.

25
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,680
But sending the Queen
on this forthcoming tour,

26
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,560
in the current climate,
would be to put the Sovereign

27
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:07,040
in an unacceptable level of danger.

28
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,160
What is it you would have the Queen do?
Stay at home

29
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:15,480
in the wake of minor incidents
prosecuted by an insurgent rabble?

30
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:21,160
What kind of signal would that send?
The Crown does not back down.

31
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,760
If Britain had made a habit
of backing down,

32
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:27,720
the world would already be
living under the yoke of fascist tyranny

33
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,400
and we wouldn't have an empire at all.

34
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:33,760
Then might I suggest
we bypass Gibraltar altogether?

35
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,920
It's an approach
which I would favor too.

36
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,040
She's not ready for something
on this scale. She's not yet up to it.

37
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:46,080
Especially with so many of our dominions
demanding independence.

38
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,280
-We must be considerate of her.
-Patronize her.

39
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:53,680
-No, that's not what I'm saying, sir.
-Yes, it is.

40
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:59,880
Bermuda. Jamaica. Australia.
Ceylon. Uganda.

41
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,120
It's going to be hot, Your Majesty.

42
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:05,360
To that end, we've been working
a great deal with organza,

43
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,200
crepe de Chine and shantung silk.

44
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:11,440
We also wanted to feature something
particular to each location,

45
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,920
so we thought
sprigs of native wild flowers

46
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,520
indigenous to each country
that you're visiting.

47
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:23,640
So, on Her Majesty's arrival in Sydney,
we propose a white organza dress

48
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,960
scattered with pale yellow
wattle blossom.

49
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,720
How many dresses are there?

50
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,280
-One hundred.
-One hundred.

51
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,560
-And hats?
-Thirty-six.

52
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,600
-Pairs of shoes?
-Fifty.

53
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:40,840
Isn't this all a bit much?
Couldn't we try to economize?

54
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:44,160
It is. It was a directive
from the government itself,

55
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,000
from the very top of the government.

56
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:51,320
To put our best foot forward
for Great Britain. Our very best foot.

57
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,640
It is an absurd pantomime,
the whole thing.

58
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,560
I don't know why anyone
can't see beyond it.

59
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:05,400
Actually, I thought the
old ostrich feathers rather suited you.

60
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:08,720
- You should wear those more often.
- Up straight, please.

61
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,320
20 years ago, Britain had influence

62
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,880
and control over one-fifth
of the world's population.

63
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,640
You look where we are now in India,

64
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:21,520
Pakistan, South Africa,
Iraq, Jordan, Burma, Ceylon:

65
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,920
all independent.

66
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,400
But nobody wants to face it
or deal with it, so...

67
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:30,600
they send us out
on the Commonwealth roadshow.

68
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:33,760
Like giving a lick of paint
to a rusty old banger

69
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,960
to make everyone think
it's all still fine. But it's not.

70
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:41,520
The rust has eaten away
at the engine and the structure.

71
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,960
The banger is falling apart.

72
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,000
But no one wants to see it.

73
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:52,360
That's our job, that's who we are.

74
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,960
The coat of paint.

75
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,920
If the costumes are grand enough,
if the tiara's sparkly enough,

76
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,400
if the titles are preposterous enough,

77
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:07,720
the mythology incomprehensible enough,
then all must still be fine.

78
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,920
-Are we nearly finished yet?
-Not quite, sir.

79
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,320
Four hours we've been here already
for a costume fitting.

80
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,560
Uniform, sir, not costume.

81
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:19,880
You wear uniforms to battle.
This is a costume fitting.

82
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,320
It's just a formality,
Your Majesty,

83
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,560
confirming your temporary assumption
of duties as Councilor of State

84
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,760
while Her Majesty is abroad.

85
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:36,160
You are so kind to still look after me
from your retirement.

86
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,200
How much is still in the diary?

87
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,760
Well, I went through it with Major Adeane

88
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:45,200
and we tried to throw out
as much as we could

89
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:48,280
but there will still be the usual
Privy Council meetings of course,

90
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:51,560
some investitures
and military inspections.

91
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:54,320
Couldn't we give some of it
to Princess Margaret?

92
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,840
I'm just thinking
she's had a tough time of it lately.

93
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:00,880
Being allowed to shine a bit
might be good for her.

94
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,200
Get her back on track.

95
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:11,000
Besides, I had rather hoped
to disappear up to Scotland for a while.

96
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:14,800
And Margaret could deputize for me.

97
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:20,840
<i> The office is tucked away</i>
<i>in a remote part of the embassy</i>

98
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,520
<i>where no one will see me.</i>

99
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,200
-So what do you do all day?
<i>-Oh, nothing!</i>

100
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,520
They can't keep you there
and give you nothing to do.

101
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:33,800
-I beg to differ, nothing is all I do.
<i>-Are you at least alone in the office?</i>

102
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:36,840
Oh, no, Sergeant Hewitt is here.
He's just walked in.

103
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:40,600
- Can he hear you?
<i>- Oh, yes.</i>

104
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,600
-Does he watch you?
-Oh, yes.

105
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,720
<i>-Is that the point of Sergeant Hewitt?</i>
-It is the only point.

106
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,240
Oh, God, how awful.

107
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,240
Well, it's not forever.

108
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,840
Feels like it, though. Two years.

109
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,440
Without you to protect me. Guide me.

110
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:14,000
I feel quite... unanchored without you.

111
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:19,520
Yes, but it's what we agreed to do,
to help your sister.

112
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,520
Then we shall be free.

113
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,480
Well, that's it. That's me off.

114
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:42,200
See you when you're back
from the tour in...

115
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,280
23 weeks.

116
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:49,480
-Well, call me if you need anything.
-Yes.

117
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,960
You won't, of course.

118
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,120
-You don't need me anymore at all.
-Yes, of course I do.

119
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,960
No, you don't. Neither of you does.

120
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,640
I have two grown-up daughters quite
capable of looking after themselves now.

121
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:07,080
-Who is it that you're staying with?
-The Vyners.

122
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:11,000
Up in Caithness at the Northern Gate?
Dunnett Head?

123
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,800
Goodness. That's the end of the earth.

124
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,080
Yes. A chance to really
get away from it all.

125
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:21,600
-Have a good think.
-About what?

126
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,000
Everything.

127
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:30,600
Well, don't think too much or too deeply.
It just gets one in a muddle.

128
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,400
Oh, by the way, I've arranged for Margaret

129
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,360
to deputize for me while I'm gone,
as Head of State.

130
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,600
-Why?
-Well, someone needs to do it.

131
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,520
Can't have people
turning up for knighthoods

132
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,320
and some civil servant handing them out.

133
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,560
-Well, if you think she's up to it.
-Up to what?

134
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,840
Standing still, looking pretty and putting
a sword on a few people's shoulders?

135
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,440
-And making speeches?
-Which will be written for her.

136
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,840
And turning up on time.

137
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,280
There are people
who will get her where she needs to be.

138
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,120
And behaving herself.

139
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,120
She will be fine.

140
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:04,640
And you, if you'll allow me
for just one moment?

141
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,360
-Please.
-You need to give Margaret some room.

142
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,360
Some space in which to shine.
She needs to shine, that one.

143
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,720
And, as elder sister,

144
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,000
you ought to be confident
and generous enough to respect that.

145
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,240
I am.

146
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,400
Are you?

147
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,200
On your knees.

148
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,440
-Is that absolutely necessary?
-Course!

149
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:50,240
I want to be sure I know
what I'm doing before you go.

150
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,320
All right.

151
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,400
I hope you have a steady hand.

152
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:59,560
You seem uncharacteristically jumpy.
Guilty conscience, perhaps?

153
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:04,120
-Why should I have a guilty conscience?
-Have a think.

154
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:08,760
-If you mean Peter and his posting...
-Banishment.

155
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:11,600
That wasn't my doing, I was simply
acting on the government's advice.

156
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,440
The idea came from your henchman.

157
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,640
-Now, that's a little firm.
-Was it?

158
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:19,520
-Yes. And it's the flat edge, remember?
-Oh, sorry.

159
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,640
-So how is he?
-Peter? He's getting on with it.

160
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,200
Uncomplainingly.
Because that's what strong men do.

161
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,720
But it's a lonely existence in Brussels.

162
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:35,840
No real job, stuck in a small flat,
followed by photographers,

163
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,560
having to steer clear of all the parties,
steer clear of all the traps.

164
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:42,600
-What traps?
-Traps being set for him.

165
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:47,520
Those who would wish to lead him astray.
Catch him in a compromising position.

166
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,880
Those who would cheer
the dissolution of our friendship.

167
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:53,000
-Margaret, you're imagining things.
-Am I?

168
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,920
Yes. And anyway, it's not for much longer.

169
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Two years?

170
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:59,400
Yes, but the first three or four months
will fly by

171
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,720
while you're kindly filling in for me.

172
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,480
-I'll try not to upstage you.
-How kind.

173
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,880
I can't promise I won't bring
my own character to it.

174
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,480
Well, I never expected anything less.

175
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,640
That's the advantage
of having a character to bring.

176
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:15,680
Too much character,
an excess of character.

177
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:19,400
Now, look at me and tell me you didn't
say that without a little bit of envy.

178
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:24,160
Just remember
who you're standing in for when I'm gone.

179
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,880
My characterless sister.

180
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:30,040
Your Queen. Not a showgirl.

181
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:50,640
...were introduced to the
people of Bermuda for the very first time.

182
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,680
The Royal couple then flies to Jamaica....

183
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:24,640
<i> The last time</i>
<i>you departed on this tour,</i>

184
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:29,160
<i>it was cruelly cut short</i>
<i>by the death of your dear father.</i>

185
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:32,440
In his final months,
the King told me many times

186
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:35,800
that he could feel it all slipping away.

187
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:39,200
The Empire, our place in the world.

188
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:44,240
He saw this tour as a chance
to keep each dominion close,

189
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,720
preserving that Empire.

190
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:50,720
So take him with you in spirit. Let his--

191
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:57,840
Let his example guide you.
His thoughts influence you.

192
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:02,440
-I will.
-And, if I may...

193
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:08,200
Never let them see
the real Elizabeth Windsor.

194
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:13,040
The cameras, the television.

195
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:18,880
Never let them see
that carrying the Crown is often a burden.

196
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:26,280
Let them look at you...
but let them see only the eternal.

197
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,240
-Thank you, Winston.
-Your Majesty.

198
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,840
Well done! You made it!

199
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:43,240
If it was easy
to come here, everybody would.

200
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,400
Thank God it isn't, and they don't.

201
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,520
- Will you want a rest?
- Certainly not!

202
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:52,800
I've been sitting for hours.
I want a nice, long walk!

203
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,600
Or, better still, a ride!

204
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,840
Go on! Go.

205
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,440
<i> Oh, Scotland! The beauty!</i>

206
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:34,680
I'd almost forgotten what it feels like
to have the spirits lifted.

207
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:38,160
Well, you're welcome to stay any time
to get away from it all.

208
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,920
You'd soon grow sick of me.
You know what they say, "Guests and fish!"

209
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:47,640
Or you could become a neighbor.
There's a castle along the coast for sale.

210
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:51,760
They're threatening to tear it down.
The owner can't afford to keep it up.

211
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:55,200
Oh, chap called Imbert-Terry.
Strange fellow.

212
00:18:55,280 --> 00:19:00,600
Rumor is, that on occasion, he sings
to the seals that swim past the castle.

213
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,040
Oh, how queer.

214
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,600
Has it been very difficult?

215
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,640
It has.

216
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:21,080
I don't want to sound self-piteous
but loss has followed loss.

217
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,520
First and foremost, the loss of a husband.

218
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:28,680
Then the loss of a home,
having to leave the palace.

219
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:34,160
The loss of motherhood,
as daughters become adults.

220
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:40,440
Loss of a routine, a sense of purpose.
The loss of a Crown.

221
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:47,720
Imagine, 17 years' experience as Queen
and being the head of the family.

222
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,800
Bertie was a wonderful husband and father,

223
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:52,320
but he needed
a great deal of help as King.

224
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,880
And then we lose him and,

225
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,040
at precisely the moment
when they should be giving me more to do,

226
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:00,840
stop me falling into despair,
they take it all aw--

227
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,400
They take it all away...

228
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:15,880
They put it all into the hands of a girl
who's totally unequipped for it.

229
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:26,480
I'm so sorry. So sorry.

230
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:31,800
"Bermuda will always have
a distinguished position

231
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:34,080
within the British Commonwealth.

232
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:39,320
A position which will, I trust,
remain unshaken by the storms

233
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,120
through which the world is passing.

234
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:47,560
My husband and I have been deeply touched
by the welcome we have received here.

235
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:54,400
Bermuda holds and will always hold
a warm place in our hearts."

236
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,240
May God bless you all.

237
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:09,240
I thought that went well, Ma'am.
Message delivered loud and clear, I'd say.

238
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:12,240
"Stay loyal or die."
Is that it now? Can we knock off?

239
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,800
I'm afraid not, sir.

240
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:17,560
Without wishing to rush you, Ma'am, we
do need to move on as quickly as possible.

241
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,760
Yes, of course.

242
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,040
Your Majesty?

243
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:26,200
So sorry, Ma'am,
I really can't manage any faster.

244
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:28,040
-Please don't worry.
-Ready for you, Ma'am.

245
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,040
Give her a chance!

246
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:34,400
It's like being in the navy again.
Eight minutes. Not nine, not seven.

247
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,960
<i> Then to the next location</i>
<i>where you'll make a speech</i>

248
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,760
to ex-servicemen at the Royal Yacht Club,

249
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:42,560
then by ferry to visit a school near
Mangrove Bay on the west of the island.

250
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:46,080
Then you will host a garden party here
at the Governor's House,

251
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,360
for a thousand or so guests,

252
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,480
where we're hoping to find a moment
for the ceremonial planting of a tree.

253
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:53,840
Will we find a moment
during any of this to use the lavatory?

254
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,800
I do hope tomorrow's better.

255
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,520
I'm afraid not, sir.

256
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,400
Up at 4:30 for a 6 a.m. flight to Jamaica.

257
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,320
Here we go again,
waving like lunatics.

258
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:10,480
Oh, God, with any luck, one day,
they'll all own television sets

259
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,880
and they won't come out like this again.

260
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:16,120
Ma'am, Sir, just before we take off,
I thought I might go through

261
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,640
the itinerary for our first day
in Jamaica.

262
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,120
-Goody.
-Yes. Do sit down, Michael.

263
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,520
Thank you. We arrive at noon
to be greeted by the Governor

264
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,800
and representatives
of the West Indian islands.

265
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:30,440
A guard of honor will be formed
by the Jamaican Constabulary...

266
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:39,400
<i> This is the picture</i>
<i>we shall never forget in Jamaica.</i>

267
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:44,240
<i>The lovely lady and the tall, handsome</i>
<i>figure of the sailor, her husband.</i>

268
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:49,880
<i>So near to all the children</i>
<i>that they can almost be touched.</i>

269
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,960
<i>- So graceful and so near...</i>

270
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:54,240
Colonel Charteris thought
you might like to see

271
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,840
the speech for tomorrow night, Ma'am.

272
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:59,000
-Give you a chance to prepare.
-Thank you.

273
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,240
Oh, dear.

274
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:12,080
-Would you bring me a pencil, please?
-Ma'am?

275
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:16,640
And ask Colonel Charteris if he'd be so
kind as to come and see me in the morning.

276
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:27,360
<i>From all over the West Indies, people</i>
<i>have come here today for this ceremony,</i>

277
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,240
<i>expressing their loyalty to her.</i>

278
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,440
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

279
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:05,960
-Come in, Martin.
-Your Royal Highness.

280
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,760
The speech for the Ambassador's
reception tonight.

281
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,080
Yes, Ma'am?

282
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,920
This was written for my sister.
Very well written.

283
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,080
-Thank you.
-Manifestly for her.

284
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:20,080
In her register, reflecting her character,
if that's the right word.

285
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:23,120
As we both know,
I have a different character.

286
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,280
Indeed.

287
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:27,240
And, since I shall be deputizing
for my sister tonight,

288
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:31,960
I was wondering if I might make
one or two minor adjustments to the text?

289
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:34,760
-Ma'am?
-Give it a bit more color.

290
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:38,320
Make it feel a bit more like me.
And breathe a little life into it.

291
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,960
I'm sure Her Royal Highness appreciates...

292
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:49,040
there'll be important people
at the reception tonight.

293
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,760
Different backgrounds,
different sensibilities.

294
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:57,040
The speech has been carefully calibrated
to avoid giving offence.

295
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,400
And I'd suggest to avoid entertaining too.

296
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:03,200
It's not the Sovereign's place
to entertain.

297
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,440
And I'm not the Sovereign.

298
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:08,360
I understand that
but you will be there in her place.

299
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:23,440
What about the State Diadem tiara?
Or the Cambridge Lovers' Knot?

300
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,360
Those are Her Majesty's
and for State occasions.

301
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:28,560
Her Majesty won't mind.

302
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:33,120
Besides, are people not coming tonight
expecting to meet a Queen?

303
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,120
-Yes.
-Shouldn't we be giving them one?

304
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,200
Your Excellencies...

305
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:16,200
I am delighted to be here tonight,
deputizing for my sister, the Queen,

306
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:18,920
who is fortunate enough
to be on her travels,

307
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,600
somewhere between Bermuda,
Jamaica and Fiji.

308
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:25,160
Distracted, no doubt,

309
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:31,040
by waving fields of sugar cane
and graceful palms,

310
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:34,920
by deep blue water
beyond white coral sands.

311
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:39,160
By dramatic green hills,
thick with vegetation,

312
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:43,400
and the subtle rhythms
of dancing and singing.

313
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:47,320
But more vivid, more brilliant even,

314
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:51,640
than the colors of those lovely islands
or the echoes of that music

315
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:56,800
or the welcome of cheerful and friendly
people wherever my sister may travel,

316
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:00,720
is what I see as I look out
from this stage tonight.

317
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:08,680
As I look out at all of you tonight.
My... don't you all look wonderful!

318
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,760
And shimmering.

319
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,760
And positively exotic.

320
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:18,600
And what fine company
we have here tonight!

321
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:21,880
Our ambassador to the United States
of America, Sir Roger Makins.

322
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,920
The only honest thing
to come out of Washington.

323
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:31,160
Our dashing ambassador,
Alec Kirkbride, in Libya.

324
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:34,360
This one's single, ladies.

325
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,840
Oh, and of course Sir Charles Peake
and his wife from Greece.

326
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:39,640
A country
which has brought us many things.

327
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:44,080
Philosophy, democracy,
my brother-in-law.

328
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,600
So to all of you, I say welcome!

329
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,920
As a rule,
the food here is pretty ordinary.

330
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,960
The wine is usually rather good.

331
00:27:56,040 --> 00:28:00,040
And I have made sure
there is plenty of it.

332
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:04,480
So I have no doubt
we will have a wonderful evening.

333
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,560
Thank you.

334
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,080
<i> It felt so good.</i>

335
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:23,200
<i>My sister talks all the time</i>
<i>of how she isn't suited to it, well...</i>

336
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:27,320
-I was born for it.
<i>-I know</i>.

337
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,880
I told them to put as many engagements
in the diary as they like

338
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:30,960
for the next few months.

339
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,600
<i>Investitures, The Royal Ballet,</i>

340
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,360
<i>-The Debutantes ball.</i>
-Well, why not?

341
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:37,600
Oh, couldn't you come
and watch me in action? Just once.

342
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,920
If I thought it were without risk,
I would in a flash,

343
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,720
-but if the papers get hold--
<i>-Darling...</i>

344
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:45,160
The papers love us. The people are for us.

345
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:48,440
-Hm.
-In their eyes we can do no wrong.

346
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:55,120
There will be no sleeping, sir,
there's a civic hall to visit.

347
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:59,920
Not to mention the ribbons to be cut.
And oh, the lunches to be consumed!

348
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,480
-Ready?
-No. Almost. You go ahead.

349
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,320
Just give me a moment, please, gents.
I'll be right with you. Okay? Thank you.

350
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,400
Right.

351
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,800
What's the matter?

352
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,360
There was an ambassadors' reception
in London last week.

353
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:27,120
Apparently,
Margaret was dazzling and brilliant.

354
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,800
Would you have preferred
she make a mess of it?

355
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,720
No.

356
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,680
Perhaps.

357
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,320
-Is that awful of me?
-Yes.

358
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,520
Well, now you know,
you didn't marry a saint.

359
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:43,520
I knew that. But I wouldn't worry,
I have great faith in her.

360
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,960
-In Margaret?
-In her ability to mess things up.

361
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:49,160
-In the long run.
-Or outshine me.

362
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:51,800
-And mess things up.
-And outshine me.

363
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,840
That's unlike you.

364
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:05,880
I'm sorry.

365
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:14,040
You know, there is a danger
we might be overdoing it.

366
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:19,840
Perhaps it would be prudent,
to take a few things out.

367
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:24,840
I mean, 57 Australian towns in 58 days.

368
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:27,400
Maybe we don't visit all of them.

369
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:33,520
No.

370
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
No.

371
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,400
We keep every appointment.

372
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:42,800
No cancellations. Not one.

373
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:49,560
I'm afraid the day does hold
some challenges, Ma'am.

374
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:52,920
The route's ten miles
and the streets are already packed.

375
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,400
-Well, how long will it take?
-I've allowed two hours.

376
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,920
Two hours! In a hundred degree heat?

377
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,480
I could ask them to increase
the planned driving speed a little.

378
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:04,960
-But I think the horses might struggle.
-No, we'll be fine. Thank you.

379
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:00,080
<i> Here she is at last,</i>
<i>amongst us.</i>

380
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:04,640
<i>Charming our people in city after city.</i>

381
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:11,160
<i>Afternoon in Sydney first.</i>
<i>Then, good hearted Adelaide.</i>

382
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:17,680
<i>On to venerable Hobart, nestling</i>
<i>at the cool feet of Mount Wellington.</i>

383
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:24,200
That's it. The Castle of Mey.

384
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,600
Isn't she bonny?

385
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,240
Oh, yes!

386
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,480
And what a view!

387
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:08,960
- Captain Imbert-Terry.
- Commander Vyner.

388
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:12,200
Lady Doris. And...

389
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:15,920
We've met.

390
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:20,040
-I don't think so.
-Yes, yes.

391
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:25,240
Yes, your...your face, it's very familiar.

392
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:27,920
Don't say a thing, it'll come to me.

393
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,080
-May we come in?
-Yes, yes.

394
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:37,160
<i> Well, if you were</i>
<i>to be interested in the property,</i>

395
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:39,680
I'm going to be entirely honest.

396
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:45,840
The roof does need a...
does need a bit of work.

397
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:49,000
One or two windows
might need replacing and the...

398
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:52,440
the electricity does need,
well, installing.

399
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:56,200
And there's no dining room to speak of.
Nor bathrooms.

400
00:33:56,280 --> 00:34:00,120
And I've sold off
most of the good shooting and fishing.

401
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,160
Oh, dear. You're really not a salesman.

402
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:06,400
In fact, the place is in such a state,
I'd sooner make a gift of it.

403
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:09,720
I'm afraid I'd be quite unable to accept.

404
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,640
Why not?

405
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:14,760
It'd be frowned upon.
Something to do with who I am.

406
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:20,280
You're an actress. A famous film star.

407
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:22,360
-No.
-A singer, then.

408
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:23,520
No.

409
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:26,880
It's on the tip of my tongue!

410
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:35,560
It dates back to
the mid 17th century.

411
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:39,960
It was in the... it was in the same
family for 14 generations.

412
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:45,160
We bought the place in 1929, and my wife
and I had 11 very happy years here.

413
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:47,760
But then, the war came and the place...

414
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:57,040
-The solution is obvious. Stop smiling.
-No.

415
00:34:57,120 --> 00:35:00,160
The trouble is, I have the sort of face
that if I'm not smiling

416
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,200
then everyone says, "Oh, isn't she cross?"

417
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:06,320
No, that's not...
Look, what do you think, doctor?

418
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:11,200
It's a spasm. The muscles are
overworked. Rest ought to fix it, though.

419
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:14,200
-Like I said. Stop smiling.
-No.

420
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:17,640
I have an engagement this evening.
So, what can be done?

421
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:22,120
Well, I could inject
the affected area with a relaxant.

422
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:24,120
You'd have to watch yourself
with soup, though.

423
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:27,480
You might find you have less control
chewing and drinking.

424
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:30,240
And it's not a long-term solution.

425
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:34,720
- Oh. All right. I'll have the injection.
- Oh. Good God.

426
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,200
What, and dribble soup
all over your dress?

427
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:40,240
Do you know, the other night,

428
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:43,000
I woke up with my right arm out
from under the bedclothes.

429
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:47,680
Do you know what I'd been doing?
I'd been waving to the crowds in my sleep.

430
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,440
Right.

431
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:56,960
Hold still, please, Your Majesty.

432
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,760
<i>American planes,</i>
<i>guns and ammunition</i>

433
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,840
<i>are helping the French</i>
<i>and Vietnam forces.</i>

434
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:16,000
<i>Russian and Chinese weapons</i>
<i>are aiding the Viet Minh.</i>

435
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:21,000
<i>Princess Margaret dons white overalls</i>

436
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:23,800
<i>when she visits Calverton Colliery</i>
<i>in Nottinghamshire.</i>

437
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:26,520
<i>Her visit to the coalface</i>
<i>a quarter of a mile underground</i>

438
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,440
<i>is included in her tour of the colliery</i>

439
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:31,760
<i>which is recognized as one of</i>
<i>the most modern in Europe.</i>

440
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:35,440
<i>After almost an hour underground,</i>
<i>the Princess brings back a souvenir,</i>

441
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,880
<i>a piece of coal she hewed herself.</i>

442
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:40,400
<i> Did you enjoy the mining,</i>
<i>Your Royal Highness?</i>

443
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:44,480
<i>I did, very much.</i>
<i>Although, it was jolly dusty down there.</i>

444
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:48,280
<i>Some even went into my mouth</i>
<i>but I can assure you, it tasted delicious.</i>

445
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:50,160
<i>Having experienced the conditions,</i>

446
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,320
<i>do you have sympathy</i>
<i>for the miners that work there?</i>

447
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,240
<i>One couldn't fail</i>
<i>to have sympathy for anyone</i>

448
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:57,120
<i>who has to spend</i>
<i>their working life down there.</i>

449
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:00,160
<i>It's intolerably dark and hot</i>
<i>and cramped.</i>

450
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:03,560
<i>To my eyes, it seemed conditions</i>
<i>are still very perilous</i>

451
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:08,040
<i>for these poor, brave men</i>
<i>who work underground for so very little.</i>

452
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:10,520
<i>What would you say</i>
<i>to the authorities regarding the matter?</i>

453
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:15,400
<i>-I have nothing further to say.</i>
<i>-Who's the coal for?</i>

454
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:21,240
<i>I have someone very special in mind.</i>

455
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,600
<i> Group Captain Townsend?</i>

456
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:31,800
<i>-Are you missing him?</i>
<i>-Yes, I am. Very much.</i>

457
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:36,280
<i> And are you missing your sister,</i>
<i>Her Majesty, the Queen?</i>

458
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:40,160
<i>- Not quite as much, no.</i>

459
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,920
- <i> Why on earth did you say that?</i>
- What?

460
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,520
<i>-That you missed me.</i>
-I did! And I do.

461
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,800
-I know but that wasn't wise.
<i>-Why not?</i>

462
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:06,280
Darling, you can't use a public occasion
to take a dig at your sister like that.

463
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:10,960
-Oh, don't you start too.
<i>-It's just... the Palace won't like it.</i>

464
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:13,560
<i>And we need the Palace on our side.</i>

465
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:18,400
Who is it you think
you'd be letting down, anyway? A koala?

466
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:24,000
This whole thing is a circus.
It's a miserable circus.

467
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:28,840
Trudging from town to town
and we're the dancing bears.

468
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:35,440
-What are you doing?
-I'm taking back this small pleasure.

469
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:39,080
-You've taken away too much.
-No! No, no! Those things will kill you!

470
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:44,120
Yeah. Forty a day your father smoked
and now I know why. Poor bastard.

471
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:46,520
Yeah, he probably took one look
at this tour and thought,

472
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,720
"D'you know what?
I'd be better off with cancer."

473
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:49,800
Shut up!

474
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:58,360
What is it you're trying to prove?
What is it you want to hear him say?

475
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:02,400
"Bravo, Lilibet. Manage the whole tour."

476
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:06,720
"Lilibet never lets you down.
Ticked every box.

477
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:09,160
Never put a foot wrong."

478
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:12,920
"Now, finally,
I love you more than I love Margaret."

479
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,840
Get out! Get out!

480
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:18,880
-Don't touch me. Oh, Christ!
-Get out!

481
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:22,760
-Philip! Don't you dare come back here!
-Don't be ridiculous! Christ!

482
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:00,520
-Let me go and have a word.
-No.

483
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:05,960
I'll do it.

484
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:20,600
I'm sorry for that little interlude.
I'm sure it must happen in every marriage.

485
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:27,360
Now, what would you like me to do?
For your newsreel?

486
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,880
Another gift for Your Majesty.

487
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:55,520
Thank you.

488
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,640
<i> Your Royal Highness...</i>

489
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:05,200
when you appear in public performing
official duties, you are not you.

490
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,320
Of course I'm me.

491
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:10,840
Expressing political opinions
about working conditions in mines,

492
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:13,760
that business at Sadler's Wells.

493
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:16,680
And no one wants you to be you,
they want you to be it.

494
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:19,120
A statue? A thing?

495
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:22,600
The Crown.
That's what they've come to see. Not you.

496
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:28,600
The minute you become yourself,
you shatter the illusion, break the spell.

497
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:34,520
What people want is someone to inhabit it.
Not be frightened of it.

498
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:36,960
Make it flesh and blood. Bring it to life.

499
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:40,800
Your uncle, Edward VIII,
threatened to do just that,

500
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:44,080
impose his individuality
on the institution.

501
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,360
Bring it to life!

502
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:48,480
And he almost destroyed it in the process!

503
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:51,480
You can't seriously be comparing this
to the Abdication?

504
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:56,840
No, but I've decided that all remaining
Royal engagements in the Queen's absence

505
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:58,720
should be carried out by the Queen Mother.

506
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:03,800
-My mother is in Scotland.
-So I gather.

507
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:08,200
But I sent someone to bring her back.
Right away!

508
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:12,720
Your Royal Highness.

509
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:20,400
- <i> We said 11.</i>
- What time is it now?

510
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:23,160
Well, it's nearly noon.

511
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:26,800
Goodness, and I set off in such good time.

512
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:29,280
-Did you come along the coast?
-I did.

513
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:35,040
You didn't factor in the wind.
You were into the wind this morning.

514
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:38,200
-Wasn't I just?
-The good news is, you'll fly back.

515
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,640
Now...

516
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:50,040
I've, um, I've had a chance
to do some thinking.

517
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:52,640
I've spoken to my lawyers
and I've come up with a sum

518
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:58,680
that I think is a fair price
for this magnificently-situated castle.

519
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:00,280
Yes, yes, go on.

520
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:05,200
Brace yourself. One hundred pounds.

521
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:11,960
-What?
-Oh, I'm sorry. Is that too dear?

522
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:14,600
-No, it's absurd.
-On the contrary, it's entirely fair,

523
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:17,880
given it'll end up
costing you tens of thousands.

524
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:21,320
-Are you sure?
-No. The question is, are you sure?

525
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:32,440
-I am.
-All right. Congratulations.

526
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:37,320
-I hope you'll be very happy here.
-Thank you. I have a feeling I will be.

527
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:39,480
I can get the place cleared out
inside a week.

528
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:41,440
Oh, only if you've somewhere to go.

529
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:44,600
I do. My sister's a few miles
down the coast.

530
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:49,240
Now, will I walk you back to the Vyners?
Down wind?

531
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:50,720
That'd be lovely.

532
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:10,400
Your Majesty,
forgive me for disturbing you.

533
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:12,400
I come from the Prime Minister.

534
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:15,840
He asks that you return
to London immediately.

535
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:19,320
-Whatever for?
-This is all the information that I have.

536
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:24,560
It seems I must go.

537
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:28,400
Oh, my gosh.

538
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:32,320
It's finally come to you.

539
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:37,400
Why on Earth didn't you say, Ma'am?

540
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:40,400
Because people always make such a fuss.

541
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:43,480
And stop being themselves.

542
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:47,280
And you would have doubled the price.

543
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:50,520
Spoken like a true Scotswoman.

544
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:22,880
Now, my speech at Valletta.

545
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:26,200
There was one adjustment
that I would like to make.

546
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:29,720
I would like to refer to Malta
as "my island of happy memories."

547
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:35,440
Very good, Ma'am.

548
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:38,760
I shall have the text retyped
for your approval.

549
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:40,200
Thank you.

550
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:49,520
Ma'am, there do remain some
security concerns about Gibraltar.

551
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:50,840
What concerns?

552
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:56,160
Death threats were sent to all the leaders
of the major political parties,

553
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:59,520
telling them that,
if our tour were to go to Gibraltar,

554
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:01,120
our safety can't be guaranteed.

555
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:05,600
I told them we should pull out.

556
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:07,120
-Why?
-What do you mean, why?

557
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:11,480
Because I don't much fancy shuffling the
streets of Gibraltar like a sitting duck.

558
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:17,600
No. Pulling out at this late hour
would make us look weak.

559
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:20,440
And it would be a great disappointment
to the people of Gibraltar.

560
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:23,720
-I say we go.
-I say we don't.

561
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:33,480
I am aware that I am surrounded by people

562
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:35,600
who feel that they could do
the job better.

563
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:42,000
Strong people with powerful characters,
more natural leaders,

564
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:45,440
perhaps better-suited to leading
from the front, making a mark.

565
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:49,640
But, for better or worse,
the Crown has landed on my head.

566
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:51,400
And I say we go.

567
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:02,800
<i> The Royal Yacht Britannia</i>
<i>sails towards Gibraltar.</i>

568
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:06,360
<i>Visible on deck, Her Majesty the Queen,</i>
<i>and the Duke of Edinburgh.</i>

569
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:12,320
<i>Accompanying Britannia, 15 A-class</i>
<i>destroyers from the Mediterranean fleet.</i>

570
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:16,280
<i>- ..shoot with a 21-gun salute.</i>

571
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:18,720
<i>A powerful signal</i>
<i>to the people of Gibraltar</i>

572
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:22,920
<i>of the Queen and the British Empire's</i>
<i>enduring support.</i>

573
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:51,520
<i>...magnificent tour has already marked</i>
<i>Her Majesty as a woman of destiny.</i>

574
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:58,360
<i>Her return to London after 50,000 miles</i>
<i>by air, land and sea</i>

575
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:03,000
<i>is a triumph of diplomacy</i>
<i>at a challenging time for the Empire.</i>

576
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:08,400
<i>Not a single item of the enormous list</i>
<i>of engagements has been missed.</i>

577
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:12,280
<i>Millions have seen</i>
<i>and greeted their Queen</i>

578
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:15,280
<i>as she leaves the Commonwealth</i>
<i>charmed and united.</i>

579
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:22,160
<i>It is already clear</i>
<i>that Her Majesty will occupy a place</i>

580
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:25,080
<i>among the famous queens of history</i>

581
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:29,200
<i>and promises a renewed role for Britain</i>
<i>in the modern world.</i>

582
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:34,600
<i>The Empire secure</i>
<i>across the four corners of the earth,</i>

583
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:38,560
<i>marking the start</i>
<i>of a new Elizabethan age.</i>

584
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:50,800
-Hello.
-Your Majesty.

585
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:58,200
Aha! Yes!

586
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:04,680
- Ma'am. Prime Minister's arrived.
- Ready, go!

587
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:06,320
-Thank you.
-I'm fast.

588
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:09,600
- Daddy! I'm going to get you.
- No, no, no! Chair! Chair!

589
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:13,400
-Mind the dogs!
-You can't get away from me!

590
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:16,840
The Prime Minister,
Your Majesty.

591
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:21,400
-Congratulations, Your Majesty.
-Thank you, Winston.

592
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:24,720
-An unqualified triumph.
-A narrow escape, I say.

593
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:26,520
It could so easily have gone
the other way.

594
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:30,760
But it didn't, and has put us
right back where we belong.

595
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:32,960
Higher, in fact.

596
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:36,480
And, before the tour,
our great nation was in danger

597
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:42,760
of losing much of its status,
our influence, our standing.

598
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:49,040
-Your courage and conviction prevailed.
-This time, perhaps.

599
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:52,920
But, in time, they will, surely,
grow tired of it. Grow tired of us.

600
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:58,520
Only if the Crown
and the people representing the Crown

601
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:01,920
make mistakes, errors of judgement.

602
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,080
-My dear sister?
-Yes.

603
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:07,920
What would you have me do?

604
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:18,640
-Thank you, Ma'am.
-Your Majesty?

605
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:21,800
-Her Royal Highness is on her way.
-Thank you.

606
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:27,120
It's all right. I have been here before.

607
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:28,880
I do know the way.

608
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:42,400
-What, in there?
-Yes, Ma'am.

609
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:05,160
Goodness!

610
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:19,800
-What have I done to deserve this?
-The brief was simple.

611
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:26,200
Perform minor ceremonial tasks
with a minimum of fuss.

612
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:27,960
Not end up all over the newspapers.

613
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:30,720
I can't help it
if they want to write about me.

614
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:33,600
Well, it would help
if you didn't give them what they crave.

615
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:36,280
-Character and excitement.
-Instability and drama.

616
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:39,160
Well, at least I give them something.
You give them nothing.

617
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:42,680
-I give them silence.
-Silence is nothing.

618
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:46,840
-It's the absence of noise.
-Emptiness. Blank page.

619
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:49,600
-Which allows others to shine.
-But the monarchy should shine.

620
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:52,920
The monarchy, yes. Not the monarch.

621
00:51:54,760 --> 00:51:59,120
-Reparations will need to be made.
-To whom?

622
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:00,800
To the people you offended.

623
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:04,880
A general, to whom,
when asked if you'd like to dance,

624
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:08,200
you replied, "Yes, but not with you."

625
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:10,760
I believe there was also a debutante
you managed to make cry,

626
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:13,040
and the dancers of Sadler's Wells,

627
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:17,160
whom you refused to meet
after arriving late for the performance.

628
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:19,680
You showed individuality.

629
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:23,400
And that made people panic.
They don't want individuality.

630
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:28,080
The last person who showed "character"
almost took the ship down.

631
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:33,080
You are enjoying this.

632
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:35,360
-Not a bit.
-Yes, you are.

633
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:41,560
Admonishing your unruly young sister.

634
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:46,040
Have you ever thought
how it must be for me?

635
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:49,480
Many times. At great length. Wistfully.

636
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:54,640
You have a role, a clear set of rules.
All you have to do is follow them.

637
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:58,120
Margaret, you have freedom.
All you have to do is enjoy it.

638
00:52:58,200 --> 00:52:59,800
You think that I am free?

639
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:03,360
To be constantly in your shadow.
Constantly the overlooked one.

640
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:06,520
-It looks like heaven to me.
-What you have looks like heaven to me.

641
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:16,400
Two sisters
who envy one another.

642
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:20,080
We wouldn't be the first.

643
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:27,120
Pride and Joy.

644
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:33,800
-Remember? What Papa called us.
-Yes.

645
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:38,640
"Elizabeth is my pride
and Margaret is my joy."

646
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:42,200
"But Margaret is my joy."

647
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:48,000
I'm sorry. I have to claim
the few victories I'm left with.

648
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:52,080
And we're not disputing it, surely?

649
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:56,200
-What?
-That I was Papa's favorite.

650
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:06,080
There's a cruel truth to it, isn't there?

651
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:09,480
When there are two sisters
so close in age,

652
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:12,680
the more one becomes one thing,
the more the other...

653
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:17,520
necessarily becomes the opposite
and vice versa.

654
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:19,800
It's the way of things.

655
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:23,280
If one is the Queen, must be the source
of honor and all that is good,

656
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:27,400
the other necessarily becomes
the focus of the most...

657
00:54:29,080 --> 00:54:30,760
creative malice.

658
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:33,200
Evil sister.

659
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:37,800
-No one says you're evil.
-Next to you, I will always be evil.

660
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:40,200
Feckless...

661
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:42,600
Lost...

662
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:45,800
Lesser thing.

663
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:53,640
And yet you spend so much time
telling me that I'm a lesser thing.

664
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:58,400
Only to give myself a moment's peace.

665
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:10,760
Would you consider doing it for me?

666
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:14,520
-Just from time to time.
-What?

667
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:18,000
Putting a foot wrong.
The occasional mistake.

668
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:20,800
Let the side down.

669
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:24,160
So I might not be so conspicuous a failure
by comparison.

670
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:27,440
-You're tired.
-No, I'm not. Not tired.

671
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:33,600
I'm just asking for a future I can bear.

672
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:41,720
Margaret...

673
00:55:47,080 --> 00:55:49,600
Do I have your word
that those apologies will be made?

674
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:56,800
We can help you draft letters
or make statements.

675
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:04,360
No need.
