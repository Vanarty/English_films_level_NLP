MAN: Take a seat, buddy!

6
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:57,400
Come on.
It was a good play.

7
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,000
Are you gonna be
like this all day?

8
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:04,200
I don't know. Is it gonna
be like this all day?

9
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:05,600
I don't know.
It's up to you.

I have no room to sit.
I got no room to sit.

11
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:07,900
I'm sitting next to
a guy who's sitting

12
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:09,400
like he's at home
on the toilet
with his legs spread.

13
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,000
Please don't crowd people.
Relax, please. Look at me.

14
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:12,400
I am relaxed.
Look how I'm sitting.

15
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,700
Why are you
sitting like that?
Because... What do you think?

16
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:15,900
Why'd you wake me up
for this shit?

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,700
Because I'm trying to relax
and have a nice day.

18
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:20,200
Sweating in the sun
like a Tijuana whore.

VENDOR: Ice-cold soda!

20
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,900
Get your soda here!

21
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:30,000
VENDOR: On the right.
Coming down there.
Pass that on down there.

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,400
Hey, hot dog guy,
can I get six hot dogs
down here, please?

23
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,000
Right away.
GARY: And make it right,
please.

24
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,200
You know, with the mustard
and the ketchup
and the relish.

25
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:37,700
Don't make me
hit you up for more.

26
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,600
I thought we were going
to Wiener Circle after this.

27
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,100
We will.
Then why are you
getting hot dogs?

28
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:45,400
Pass this down, please.
You can keep the change.

29
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,300
Do you want
one of the hot dogs?

30
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,200
GARY: You can have a hot...
You want a hot dog?

31
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:50,300
Do you want a hot dog, miss?

32
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,600
No. Thank you.
You can have one.

33
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:53,000
That's okay.
Go ahead.
You can have a hot dog.

34
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,000
No, I don't want one.
Excuse me, sir?

35
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:55,500
Would you mind
passing the lady
one of the hot dogs?

36
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,600
I'm good, thanks.
You don't have to share.

37
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,500
You can have your own.
Thanks. That's really
nice of you.

38
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,800
Just have one, please.
Okay, give me a hot dog.

39
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:02,900
Somebody give her a hot dog.
I got... The big guy can't
eat all of them. Have one.

40
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:04,900
Have you ever had one before?
A hot dog?

41
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:07,400
At the ballpark?
I have. I believe I have.

42
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,500
Okay, good.
Thank you.

43
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,400
Well, enjoy this one.
Thanks.

44
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,600
Do you like mustard?
No, I'm okay.

45
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:15,300
It's much better
with a topping. Here.

46
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:18,300
I'm just kidding,
I'll give you two.

00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:24,900
Cheers!
Thanks.

49
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,200
We'll share it.

50
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,200
It's a good dog.
I like the hot dog. I know.

51
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,200
That's nice.

52
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,100
You have a problem
with me eating a hot dog,
guy?

53
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:36,700
I'm trying to watch the game
and have a hot dog.

54
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,700
I'll smack him
in his head.
No, just leave him alone.

55
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:58,500
Hey, you want
to go get a drink?
No.

56
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,400
I'm with somebody, sorry.

57
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,700
Who? The guy with
the tucked-in shirt
and the visor?

58
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,600
What, is that like a brother?
The guy was not
your brother, then.

59
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:06,900
Who is this guy?
He's not my brother.

60
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,900
Who's this...
I'm getting mad now.
I'm jealous. Who is this guy?

61
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,500
Who are you?
I don't know.
I'm kidding with you.

62
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,600
Who's the guy with
the tucked-in stuff?
Is that a boyfriend?

63
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,800
Uh, it's...

64
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,200
I'm going.
Do you think
you'll marry him?

65
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,100
What?
'Cause I know
you've thought about it.

66
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:20,600
The first time
you laid eyes on him,
you probably thought,

67
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:24,200
"I wonder if I could marry
this guy in plaid shorts who
tucks his shirt in. No way."

68
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,900
Then when you kissed him,
you said, "I can't believe it.

69
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,600
"I had a lot to drink
tonight. I'm kissing
the tucked-in guy."

70
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:31,100
My point is, if you're
not gonna marry him...
Yeah.

71
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,300
...and if it's not forever,

72
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,000
then you really don't have
anything to lose in
taking me up on my offer.

73
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,900
Uh-huh. Well, I'm gonna go.
Okay. Me, too.

74
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,900
Okay.
To where? On an
ice-breaking first date?

75
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,700
Well, no, I don't think...
Listen.

76
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,700
If you want to stay
off the market
while you're with

77
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:46,100
I'm-not-the-one-
but-I'm-comfortable,
then you can do that.

78
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,600
But for all you know,
I just offered you

79
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:50,200
a get-out-of-bored-Iove-
for-free card
with no strings attached.

80
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,700
God, you're crazy.
No, I'm not crazy.

81
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,600
And a lot of times people go,
"Oh, that's crazy,"

82
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,000
and then they go,
"It's genius."

83
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,700
That's what happened
when the person invented fire.

84
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,900
They burned that witch.
And guess what, then they got
warm and they ate good stuff.

85
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,800
Now, where are we headed to?
Let's not make this weird,

86
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,300
'cause I'm not good on dates.
No. You know what?

87
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,200
I'm better just to kind of
hang out and,
if we don't have fun,

88
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:06,200
I might go my separate way.
Okay.

89
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:09,000
I'm not committing
to anything. I'll go hang out
with you for a little bit.

90
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,900
That's not gonna happen.
But I can't say for sure.

Hi, honey.
Hi.

127
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:52,300
Christmas was months ago.
Don't remind me.
I miss it so much.

128
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,400
Yeah, I know.
But today is not a holiday.

129
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:00,300
I know for a fact
that people like
my spirit on the phone

130
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,200
and they dig the energy
that I give them.

131
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:06,200
Okay. I'm just saying,
I don't think Marilyn Dean
will "dig" the energy.

132
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:09,100
Oh, no.
She's the one that told me
to be creative. So...

133
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:11,700
I know. It's just... Okay.
What is the next holiday
coming?

134
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,300
The Fourth of July,
is that what's next?

135
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:15,000
Well, if you want
to get technical,
there's Memorial Day,

136
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:17,100
there's Flag Day.

137
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,900
Some people recognize
Father's Day as a holiday.
I don't.

138
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,600
I get it. I get it.
Well, on those days
you can say, "Happy Holidays."

139
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,900
Every other day,
"Good morning, good afternoon,

140
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,400
"good evening,
Marilyn Dean Gallery."
Okay?

141
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,100
Okay.

142
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,100
I'm so sorry about that.
Oh, no.

So, now this is a new piece

What do you think of this?

145
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,600
Can I be honest with you?
Please.

146
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,600
Other than taking
an art history class
in college,

147
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:53,500
which I pretty much
slept through, I don't have
the first clue about art

148
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,300
or how to go about buying it.
I mean, like that painting.

149
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:02,300
I mean, I don't see the point
in buying something that
I could have done myself.

150
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:05,500
Yeah. I completely agree
with you.

151
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,100
You know, an art teacher
of mine once said,

152
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,700
"Never buy a piece of art
that you don't have to have."

153
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:17,200
You know, don't worry
about who the artist is
or how much it's worth.

154
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:21,200
I mean, you have to live
with it every day. You have
to walk by it every day.

155
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,800
You know, you have to
really love it. You have
to really appreciate it.

156

How's it going?
BROOKE: It's good.

160

Oh, wow. You got
a lot happening.
I know.

161
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:40,900
Very exciting.
I am starving.

162

Oh, careful. That's really...
That's very hot.
Oh, that's hot, hot, hot.

00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,500
Yep.
Jesus.

164
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,700
Hey, honey,
you've got to really...
You should get ready, okay?

165
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,300
Oh, you look great.
Thank you.

166
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:52,700
Got a lot of nice stuff.
Got a pizza.

167
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,900
All kinds of stuff.
Terrific.

168
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:58,700
I just need you
to decide what to...
You know, I did everything.

Gary?
Yeah?

172
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:12,700
Oh, come on! Really?
You got three lemons.

What my baby wants,
my baby gets. You know that.

174
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,800
Yeah, but I wanted 12.
Baby wanted 12.

175
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:21,100
Why would you want 12 lemons?

176
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:24,000
Because I'm making
a 12-lemon centerpiece.

177
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:27,100
So, no one's actually
even eating them?
They're just show lemons?

178
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,700
Yeah. They're just
show lemons. Shown in
the center of the table.

00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:31,900
I'm glad you find that
amusing,

180
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,200
but I cannot fill a vase
with only three lemons.

181
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,700
Well,
can't you just use, like,
maybe a drinking glass?

182
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,900
I'm not gonna use
a drinking...

183
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,600
We could have
a smaller version
of a centerpiece.

184
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:41,700
I'm not gonna use
a drinking glass
for our centerpiece.

185
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:42,800
You know what?
I've got an idea.

186
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:46,100
Why don't we go ahead and
scratch the centerpiece idea
altogether,

187
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,100
because the chicken
that burnt my mouth

188
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:50,000
could maybe use
a little bit of lemon
on top of it.

00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:54,600

a better meal versus something

What?

You've done such a great job
already. Don't you want
to finish it yourself

199
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,900
and have that personal power
of that accomplishment?

200
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,800
Set the table.
Listen to me.

201
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:26,100
Do you think that
when Michelangelo, right,

202
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,700
was painting
the Sixteenth Chapel,
that he said,

203
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,500
"Hey, guys, you know,
I did pretty good
on the first 15 chapels,

204
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,700
"but why don't you help me
design this one?

205
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,900
"And maybe
you could help me...
Give me a brush

206
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:39,100
"and you guys can
grab brushes, and we can all
make a great chapel." Uh-uh.

207
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:42,300
No, he didn't.
And you wanna know
what the results were?

208
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,800
A masterpiece.

209
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,600
Okay. It's the Sistine Chapel,
not the Sixteenth,

210
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:54,300
and I bet when Michelangelo
asked for 12 brushes,
they didn't bring him three.

211
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,900
Yeah. Okay, all the talking
is really starting
to drain me,

212
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,200
and now I'm gonna have to
watch the highlights later
to see what I missed here.

Honey, look, Gary, just...
Down time's important.

214
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:03,600
Gary, please just
take a shower, okay?
Down time's important.

215

I don't want to have happen.

our families haven't
had many opportunities

232
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:46,400
to get to know one another,
we figured, what better way
than to break some bread?

those Feng Shui books

to good use.

so well balanced.

might be a little more amazing

00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:14,900
if we had a pool table.

244
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,500
Gary, we've already
discussed that.

245
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:22,300
We're gonna get a pool table
when we get a bigger place.

246
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,600
The place is plenty big now,
if you wanted a pool table
because...

247
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:26,500
Gary.
Yeah. You could take
the dining room table,

248
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,800
go ahead and move her
in the living room.

GARY: Plenty of room.

250
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,900
And put a dining room table
in the living room? Okay.

251
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:34,900
How do you...
I mean, what do you do
with a dining room table?

252
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,900
Eat on it.
We'd have no furniture
in the living...

253
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,600
Where's the furniture go?
All I'm saying is,

254
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,100
it would be nice
to be able to shoot some pool.

255
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,300
Well, this isn't a dorm.
Look, baby,
I completely understand.

256
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:43,800
There's halls and stuff.
I mean, you can go...

257
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:46,500
We will wait
and get a pool table
when we have a bigger place.

Norma Lee, who?

265
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,900
Normally, I don't go around
knocking on doors,

266
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,700
but would you like to buy
an encyclopedia?
LUPUS: I got a joke.
I got a joke.

267
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,000
(ALL CHUCKLING)
How's it going?
I got a joke for you.

268
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:16,800
What do you get when you cross
a gay Eskimo and a black guy?

269

I think we've had enough
with the jokes for tonight.

with each other.

All right.

I saw that Three Brothers
article in the <i>Trib</i> this week.

273
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,300
Sounds like you guys are up
to some pretty exciting stuff.

274
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:34,300
Basically, our big goal is to
try to take Chicago tourism
by air, land and sea.

275
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:37,800
We're still in the ground
phase with the buses.

276
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:46,000
But as soon as we get
our infantry established,

277
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:49,500
then we'll take it
to the squids.
Yeah.

278
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:54,100
Boats. Boats.
Oh, boats.

279
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:57,300
As soon as we control
the waterway, then we'll
bring in air supports

280
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:00,200
and then we'll pretty much
control everything.

281
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,200
You know, Dennis,

282
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:07,100
the way your face lights up
when you describe
your ambitions,

283
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,100
it's really inspiring.

284
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:13,200
Oh, thanks.
Because I understand

285
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:16,100
how you feel that passion.

286
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:19,900
RICHARD: And sharing it
with other people, I think
that's what life's about.

287
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:23,200
I don't feel that about
boats and squibs... Squids?

288
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,400
ALL: Squids.
Sorry.

289
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:27,900
CAROL: Yeah.
But I do feel it
about singing.

290
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:34,800
With my <i>a cappella</i> group,
The Tone Rangers.

291
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,200
Although it's not
as aggressive as your dream,

292
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:44,200
it's really
more of a brotherhood.
It's like a musical team.

293
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,200
It's like a symphony of guys.
Guy symphony.

294
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:52,000
And it's very hard
to describe the true magic

295
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:56,300
of a group of guys
singing in perfect harmony.

296
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,400
It's transcendent.

297
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,900
But it's still very real.

298
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:06,000
I guess the best way
to put it in words is just...

299
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,100
(SINGING SINGLE NOTE)

300
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,400
Even that doesn't do it.

301
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:26,700
That doesn't do it
because that's just
one person.

302
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,000
And what I'm talking about is
the pulse of the collective.

303
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,300
Oh, heck. Let me just
show you how it's done.

a little percussion?

one thing today,
one very simple thing,

and you brought me three.

that it was gonna be
this much trouble,

404

I would have brought home
24 lemons. Even 100 lemons.

at that goddamn table

Gary, it's not
about the lemons.

Well, that's all
you're talking about.

it'd be nice if you did
things that I asked.

It would be even nicer
if you did things without
me having to ask you!

doing something for you

you could have said,

"Yeah, I think I'm gonna
get Brooke some flowers."

418
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:20,500
You said
on our very first date
that you don't like flowers,

419

You said that you
don't like flowers.

to take that to mean
that you do like flowers?

No. This is not about...
You're not...
God, you're not getting it.

Gary, okay?

It's not about the dishes.

drop hints about the ballet?

gonna end.

It's not about you
loving the ballet, Gary.

434
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:58,100
It's about the
person that you love
loves the ballet

435
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,200
and you wanting to spend time
with that person.

436

at the ballet.

have to work one day.

All I ask, Brooke,

450
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,100
is that you show a little bit
of appreciation.

with questions and nagged
the whole damn time.

probably go work out."

what you want, Gary?

Yeah.

Yeah.

and he didn't do it.

475
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:05,900
Then he complained
that he had to do anything,

476
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,600
and I just felt like
I had no choice.

477
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:10,200
No, sweetie,
you did have a choice, okay?

478
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:13,500
And it sounds like you
made the right one.
You respected yourself.

479
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:17,000
But it's just not what I want.
I don't want to break up
with him.

480
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:21,100
I don't. I just want him
to say thank you. I want him
to want to do the dishes.

481
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,000
I just want him to want
to take me to the ballet.

482
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:27,500
I want him to get me
12 lemons! You know...

483
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:34,100
I just want him to care
enough about this relationship
to want to work on it.

484
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,200

No, Ad. Don't.

Please, I really don't
want to see anybody.
I really don't.

487
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,800
But, look, I'm worried
about you, okay?

488
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:45,000
And I can hear you in there
banging around your dishes.

489
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:47,900
And I don't want you
getting out your Clorox
and your rubber gloves,

490
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,900
and taking this out
on the kitchen.
Look, look, look.

491
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:56,500
Okay. Tonight just...
It just got a little
out of hand,

492
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:01,800
and hopefully
he's just gonna realize

493
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:05,300
that he's got some changes
to make and he's gonna...

494
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:10,100
He's gonna come home
and apologize.

00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:14,300

the relationship.
Whatever.

499
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:23,300
So, it's just kind of,
"You're done
with the relationship?"

500
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,800
Well, you're obviously
hurt about it.

501
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:26,400
She got to you. You're hurt.
I'm not.

502
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,000
It's nothing to be ashamed of.
She hurt you.

503
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:29,200
Will you look at me?
I'm not heartbroken.

504

I'm a little shocked.
I'm a little surprised.

505
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:33,500
Gary, you're devastated.
Now, what's the name
of the guy she's doing?

506
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,300
I'm gonna solve your problem.
What's his name?

507
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,500
What are you talking about?
Have you checked her e-mail?

508
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,600
I don't check e-mails.
I don't...

509
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:40,400
You can get a program
that records keystrokes.

510
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,000
It costs, like, 20 bucks.
Very easy to use. Okay?

511
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,500
You get a password, you check
her e-mail. You find out
everything about her.

512
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:47,900
That's how I found out
about the Puerto Rican

513
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,500
that Stacy was
running around with.
Okay.

514
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,600
You are reading
a little too much
into this situation.

515
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:53,400
There is no one she's
running around with, okay?

516
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,800
We had a fight
over the groceries
I brought home.

517
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:56,900
You're probably right.
She's probably not
sleeping with anybody.

518
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,300
No. Not what it's about.
Okay.

519
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,900
Maybe she's with
another guy, maybe not.
She's not.

520
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,400
I don't know.
I'm not Columbo. Okay?

521
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:06,200
But what we do know
is that she doesn't want
to be with you anymore.

522
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:12,300
I mean, I hate to be shitty
about it, and so cut and dry,
but let's face it.

523
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,400
She says she doesn't
want to be with you,
and I believe her.

524
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,500
Now, we gotta figure it out.
And you're gonna
need a place to go

while you get your head
right over this thing.

out of the place.
Oh, you're not moving out.

in the place.

in this case.

who gets to keep
the goddamn place.

who she's sleeping with,

She's gonna move out
of the place, Johnny.

she was moving out?
She will.

00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:40,500
Well, don't you think
you and I should discuss
something first?

630
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:43,000
Like what? How your
47 average is killing us?

631
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,600
Okay. Great. No.

632
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:50,000
Gary, this is couples bowling.
And since you and I
are no longer a couple,

633
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:52,000
because you have chosen

634
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,900
not to participate
constructively
in our relationship,

635
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:57,800
we're now singles.

636
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:01,500
So, there's not room
for two singles on the team.

637
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:08,000
Why do you look confused?

638
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:13,400
I don't have any idea
what's happening.
I've come to play on the team.

639
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,200
Look, Gary, I just don't think
it's a good idea

640
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:18,100
for you and I to be around
each other any more
than we have to right now.

641
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:20,300
I completely agree.
Maybe you should go
play some pinball.

642
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:23,400
No, I think you should leave.
Okay.

643
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:29,600
Brooke, when a man makes
a commitment to a team,
he honors that commitment.

644
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:34,400
He doesn't let emotions
or personal issues
get in the way of victory.

645
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,900
And I've made a commitment
to this team.

646
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:40,600
They don't want you here
either, Gary.
Yeah. Sure, they don't.

647
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:42,400
They don't.
They're my friends.

648
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:46,200
But you're not
a strong bowler.
That's not the point.

649
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:49,700
You know what? Let's just...
Why don't we let them decide?

650
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:53,400
Gary, don't. No.
Don't involve them, okay?
That's unnecessary.

651
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,200
What's wrong, Castro?
Castro?

652
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:57,000
Well, Castro doesn't
let people vote as a team.

653
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:59,200
Okay. Ask them.
Thank you.

654
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:02,000
Okay, everyone.
Team vote here.

655
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:05,500
By a show of hands,
just put it up when you
make a decision,

656
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:09,700
who here agrees with Brooke
and thinks I should leave
the bowling team?

657
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:13,300
Shocker.

658
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:34,800
<i>Band of Brothers.</i>
You should rent it sometime.

659
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:41,100
Good luck, everyone.
Riding Miss Gutter Ball
to the finals.

660
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,600
Hey, Gary.
Yeah.

661
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:50,500
I'm gonna need
your shirt back.
What?

662
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:54,400
Well, we're gonna have to
replace you, and you know
we get docked 10 pins

663
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:57,300
if everyone's not in matching
Pin Shakers uniforms.

664
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:00,300
My shirt says "Gary" on it.
Granted.

665
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:03,600
But actually,
we know a guy named Gary.

666
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:08,000
And he's not as tall as you,
but he's a pretty good bowler.

667
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:20,700
I'm gonna have to request
that I have my wrist guard
back then.

668
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,900
I'm sorry. That's mine.

669
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:31,200
Just give me
the goddamn wrist guard,
please. Thank you.

670
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:33,300
I hope your wrist snaps.

671
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:41,500
Wow. Okay? You see that?
You know what I mean?

672
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:43,100
Yeah. That was awesome.

673
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,800
You just had your
ex-boyfriend, who you wish
you were still dating,

674
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:47,900
voted off the bowling team.

675
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,300
Well, I had to do that
to get him right
where I want him.

676
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,200
Where's that?
Shirtless in the parking lot?

677
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:54,600
Addie,
you're not getting this.

678
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:58,300
Gary loves this bowling team.
He's hurt right now.

679
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,000
He's feeling pretty bad.

680
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:02,800
He's gonna go out there
and he's gonna get drunk.

681
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:05,400
He's gonna make
a complete fool of himself.

682
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:08,000
And he will be sitting there
feeling pretty Ionely

683
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,300
and pretty pathetic,
and then it's just
gonna hit him.

684
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:13,900
What's gonna hit him?

685
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:16,400
That not only is he
out a girlfriend,

686
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:19,300
but his life is just
falling apart piece by piece

687
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,200
and maybe that life
was pretty great.

688
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:24,100
And maybe I was the glue
that was holding it all
together.

689
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:25,700
And if he wants
that life back,

690
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:28,500
he's gonna have no choice
but to change.

691
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,200
(MUSIC PLAYING)

692
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,700
How about this, huh?
I feel like
we just found hell.

693
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,700
When did you start
coming to knobby joints
like this?

694
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,900
I might be the greatest
you've ever seen, pal.

695
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,400
I'm conquering new frontiers.
Hello, babe.

696
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:43,000
Yeah, you've got to put up
with the bad music
and the $15 drinks,

697
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,200
but this place is stacked
with top-shelf, young,
dumb ass.

698
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,500
All you gotta do is just
separate the weaker ones
from the herd.

699
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:49,800
Come on,
I'll get you into the VIP.

700
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:51,600
Can I get a couple drinks
from you?
Okay, L.G.

701
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:53,800
Lupus, I got to be totally...
I got to be honest with you.

702
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:55,100
I'm not feeling it here.

703
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:56,500
You're gonna like it in here.
You're gonna love it.

704
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,700
I don't like it out here.
Look, listen to me,
will you, please?

705
00:38:58,800 --> 00:38:59,900
How you doing, Buzz?

706
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,200
While you were
on the inside locked up
for the past two years,

707
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:03,500
the game has changed.

708
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,800
(WOMEN CHEERING)

709
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:10,200
Do you remember
when you were an outdoor cat

710
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:12,700
and you used to have to hunt
and kill for your food?

711
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,200
Well, you've become
an indoor cat.

712
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:15,900
You've been getting your milk
brought to you

713
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:17,000
in a silver bowl,
and guess what?

714
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:18,700
Now, you've been
tossed back outside

715
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:22,000
and the alley has changed.
For example,
your MTV generation,

716
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,000
your technology,
your text message,
your TiVo. You name it.

717
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,200
People want their
information faster.

718
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:30,300
People e-mail each other
because they want to
exchange information, Gar.

719
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:33,000
They don't want to connect,
they want results.

720
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,700
Okay.
You gotta get to
the message quicker.

721
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:38,600
Now, I want you to watch.
It's real simple. Okay?

722
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,300
How you doing, ladies?

723
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,500
Now, here's what I'd like
to do to you.

724
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,900
First, I'd like to
get you naked.

725
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,600
And then I'm gonna take
some Saran Wrap

726
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:49,400
and I'm gonna wrap you
up in it, head to toe.

727
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:50,600
Then I'm gonna
cut out two holes.

728
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:52,500
One for your mouth,
so you can breathe,
obviously.

729
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:53,700
And the other one...
Asshole.

730
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,500
It could be a gorgeous
evening for us, babe.

731
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:56,800
The pink is gorgeous.
Jesus, God.

732
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:58,800
Come here.
Lupus, listen to me.
I want you to listen to me.

733
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:00,200
There are our drinks.
You want your drink?

734
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:02,400
No, I'm fine.
Thank you.
The L.G. thanks you.

735
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,500
Will you listen to me,
please? You're my brother
and I love you very much,

736
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:08,000
and maybe you do
get laid tonight,
but maybe you get arrested.

737
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:10,200
Arrested for what, babe?
Being awesome?

738
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:13,900
Come on, babe, listen.
You want to tell your jokes,
tell your jokes.

739
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,800
But sooner or later
you're gonna get hungry
and you're gonna wanna eat.

740
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:21,600
And jokes might
make you feel better,
but they don't get you fed.

741
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:25,500
I'm gonna go take a lap.

742
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,400
(DOOR OPENING)

743
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,300
(DOOR SHUTTING)

744
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:39,200
What are you doing?
I'm sketching.

745
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:41,700
And where are you sketching?

746
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:44,200
In the living room.
No, in my bedroom.

747
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:45,800
And I didn't say anything
to you, Brooke,

748
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:48,200
when you so arrogantly
claimed the bed
without asking me,

749
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:51,700
but you can't just waltz
into my room and turn it
into a damn art fair.

750
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:54,100
Gary, I've only taken up
a little bit of space, so...

751
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:56,100
I don't care if you only
took an inch.

752
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:59,700
There might not be
a door here, but this
is my domain. Okay?

753
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:02,100
I don't go into your bedroom
and set up a goddamn sawhorse.

754
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:04,800
Well, then what the hell
is that pool table
doing in the dining room?

755
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:07,400
Because that's a common area.
And that's where this belongs.

756
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:08,900
Not in my room.
Hey, what are you doing?

757
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,700
It belongs in another
common area.
Gary.

758
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:13,200
People want to come home
and they want to relax
in their room.

759
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:16,000
Gary, it is 2:00
in the morning!

760
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:18,700
Don't you drop my things.
I don't know
what to tell you, kid.

761
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:19,800
This is how I am
when I'm single.

762
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:21,900
My hours start to get
pretty strange.

763
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,900
Might be time for you
to think about moving out.

764
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Why would I...
No, I'm not moving anywhere.

765
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:28,200
Gary, just please
turn the volume down.

766
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:30,400
Yeah, but I don't tell you
what the hell to do
in your room.

767
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:32,000
You can doodle. You can dance.

768
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:33,500
You can bake
a goddamn gingerbread house.

769
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:34,600
I don't give a shit.

770
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:37,400
But in my room,
I want to relax
and watch my highlights

771
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:40,100
in complete surround-sound
experience.

772
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:43,600
What the hell are you doing?
You're not even gonna
watch it!

773
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:45,300
Don't tell me what I am
or aren't not doing.

774
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:47,000
Oh, what you are not,
not doing?

775
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:49,300
Go learn some English.
Oh, I'm sorry.

776
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:52,900
I didn't have a grandfather
on the board of
some fancy college.

777
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,700
Key word being "was."
Did he touch the Filipino
exchange student?

778
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,000
Did he not touch
the exchange student?

779
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:58,700
I don't know, Brooke.
I wasn't there.
Okay.

780
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:00,000
No, don't start
with the family stuff.

781
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:02,100
Like your family's so perfect?
Your brother's a pervert!

782
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:04,700
Don't talk to me about
the sexual habits
of family members.

783
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:06,400
What about your sister?

784
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:10,500
My sister's
been through a lot.
Of dick.

785
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:14,100
There are some problems, Gary,
but can we please
just leave it...

786
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:18,200
Problems? She slept with
the entire Arizona Cardinals
offensive line.

that guy sing
just one more time,

I'd hang myself
with wax dental floss.

Could the guy just
come out of the closet,
please?

793

Richard is not gay.

794

Okay, lassie,
I want you to listen to me
and listen good.

795
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,000
I'm not saying
he won't get married.

I'm not saying
he won't even have kids.

797
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:47,700
But then one day
his wife will come home,

798
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:49,800
and then she'll find him
with a guy named Majulio,

and clubbing each other

they needed someplace
to rehearse,

so I very clearly
told Richard,
"Stay in my room,"

which you explained to me
was my space to do
with what I want.

Really?
Is that how you see it?

854
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:57,500
There's a really big gap
between getting
your ass kicked

855
00:45:57,500 --> 00:46:01,400
and having
a dancing, singing sprite
fool you with trickery

856
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:04,900
and then strike your throat
before you know that
you're even in a fight.

something we can get.
Shoe, shoe...

945
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:38,600
Shoe! Shoe, shoe, shoe.

946
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,300
Shoeless Joe Jackson.
Draw something different.
No one's getting it.

947
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:43,000
Shoe. What, is that
a smaller shoe?
JOHNNY O: Baby shoe.

948
00:49:43,100 --> 00:49:45,100
Smaller shoe. Baby shoes.
JOHNNY O: Shoes.

949
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:46,800
Baby shoes.
Smaller shoe. Gumshoe.

950
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:48,000
GARY: Smaller shoes.
DIANE: Gumshoe? Gumshoe?

951
00:49:48,100 --> 00:49:50,600
Running Olympics.
JOHNNY O: Inside the shoe.

952
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:53,500
Inside a shoe. A bubble...
JOHNNY O: Lining.

953
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:55,800
Stop pointing at the shoe.
We're not...
No one's guessing shoe.

954
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:57,400
Stop pointing at the shoe
and draw something different.

955
00:49:57,500 --> 00:49:58,500
(TIMER RINGING)
Draw something different.
You...

956
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:01,100
Goddamn it!
No one's guessing shoe!

957
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:04,300
You drew a big shoe,
then a small shoe,
and no one got it.

958
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:07,600
You gotta draw something
different. Everyone said
"shoe" seven times.

959
00:50:07,700 --> 00:50:09,400
It's a sock, asshole.

960
00:50:10,700 --> 00:50:11,800
You call yourself an artist?
Yes!

961
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:14,500
A three-year-old with
a box of crayons could
do a better job than this.

962
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:17,400
I'm sorry, I don't have
the great talent of standing
on top of a big red bus

963
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:19,600
and pointing out architecture
that other great men
have built!

964
00:50:19,700 --> 00:50:20,900
I'm the one who should
be sorry, Brooke.

965
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,700
I shouldn't sit here
and pick on your art.
No.

966
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:24,900
Because you got
the nuts part down,
Picasso.

967
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,600
GARY: All you have
to do is
cut off your frigging ear.

968
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:27,800
BROOKE: That's Van Gogh,
you idiot!

969
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:29,800
And your insults
are much more effective
when they're accurate.

970
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:31,000
Don't talk to me about
being goddamn accurate!

971
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:32,200
I can talk to you
about anything that I want.

972
00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:33,500
'Cause you couldn't even
draw a sock.

973
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:34,700
You don't do anything right!
You're a lazy...

974
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:36,000
Everyone said,
"Shoe, shoe, shoe!"

975
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:40,600
At first,
I figured that the split
was just something temporary,

976
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:43,800
something that you two
would work out and get past,

977
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:45,400
but after tonight
I think it's pretty clear

978
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:48,600
that you two genuinely
do not want to
get back together.

979
00:50:48,700 --> 00:50:50,600
There's not a shot in hell.
Gary.

980
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:52,300
I'm just...
I got you.

981
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:55,600
As your friend
and as your realtor,

982
00:50:55,700 --> 00:50:56,900
I'm not gonna
leave here tonight

983
00:50:56,900 --> 00:50:58,600
until we decide
what to do about this condo,

984
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:03,000
because this living situation
is obviously not working out.

985
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:07,400
Gary?

986
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:14,400
Well, the only logical thing
that I can think of

987
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:18,000
is for her to move out
of the condo,

988
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:21,800
and then to pay me some
sort of a penalty
as compensation for

989
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:24,100
the labor that I did
all around the condo.
What? What?

990
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:27,200
What? Pay you compensation
for your labor?

991
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:30,400
We fixed this place up
together.
Are you nuts?

992
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:32,200
Stop calling me nuts,
I swear to God.
I fixed the...

993
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:33,400
You went around with a sponge,

994
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:34,900
and you went in the bathroom
and you dotted foofy shit.

995
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,600
That's what you're saying
that I did?
GARY: There's no...

996
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:38,200
BROOKE: That was...
That's called aesthetics.

997
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:40,300
It warmed this place up
so it didn't look like

998
00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:42,600
an army barracks,
which it was about to.

999
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:44,600
I'll tell you what
it's called in his language,
depreciated.

1000
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:46,600
That's what it's called.
You don't even know
what that means.

1001
00:51:46,700 --> 00:51:49,100
Unless the next buyer
happens to have your same
Zulu-voodoo-land taste.

1002
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:50,400
All right.
Let me tell you
something else.

1003
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:52,900
It's gonna cost money
to cover up the holes
in the wall.

1004
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:56,400
The holes that you drilled
in the wall there to hang up
whatever that thing is called.

1005
00:51:56,500 --> 00:51:57,500
Oh, please. Gary.

1006
00:51:57,600 --> 00:51:58,600
GARY: You're gonna have
to cost money to fix that.

1007
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:01,200
What I did, Brooke,
has concrete value
to the condo.

1008
00:52:01,300 --> 00:52:03,100
I added concrete...
Well, let's just go on record.

1009
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:06,000
We're dealing with facts here.
I did the tiling
in the bathroom.

1010
00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:07,800
Have you seen...
I did the new track lighting.

1011
00:52:07,900 --> 00:52:09,700
That tile is the
shittiest tile job.
GARY: I did the plumbing!

1012
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:11,200
The plumbing!
That's realty terms.

1013
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:13,100
Okay. Let's talk
about your plumbing.
This is his plumbing.

1014
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:14,300
We have two temperatures
in our bathroom.

1015
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:17,100
We get either scalding hot
or we get frostbite.

1016
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:18,700
That's it. That's all we get.
It's my problem

1017
00:52:18,700 --> 00:52:20,100
that she doesn't know how
to pace a shower?

1018
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:21,200
GARY: Now all of a sudden
that's my fault.

1019
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:22,300
I get a minute
to take a shower.

1020
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:23,600
One minute?
BROOKE: One minute of warmth?

1021
00:52:23,700 --> 00:52:25,800
Oh, Jesus. One minute.
That's it. That's correct.

1022
00:52:25,900 --> 00:52:28,600
Thank God you're not
in charge of keeping all the
clocks in Chicago on time.

1023
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:31,200
This is basic logic.
You are out of your mind.
You have lost it.

1024
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:33,000
Let me explain this to you
in plain chapter and verse.

1025
00:52:33,100 --> 00:52:37,200
Cheese and rice,
you guys are gonna kill
each other. Now, let's just...

1026
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:39,800
Realistically speaking,
neither one of you

1027
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:42,000
can afford this mortgage
on your own, okay?

1028
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,700
And that's a shame,
because this building will
continue to increase in value.

1029
00:52:45,700 --> 00:52:48,000
I get nothing but
phone calls about it,
all right?

1030
00:52:48,100 --> 00:52:49,700
Waiting for a unit to open up.

1031
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:53,400
So, as your realtor,
the last thing I would suggest
is selling.

1032
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:57,000
But as your friend,
I just, I don't see
any other solution.

1033
00:52:57,400 --> 00:52:59,300
You take your halves,
you go your separate ways,

1034
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:01,300
and you get on
with your lives.

1035
00:53:03,100 --> 00:53:07,800
I know that selling is not
the easiest thing, but
I do think that it's the best.

1036
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:12,000
And to be honest,
this is a situation

1037
00:53:12,100 --> 00:53:15,400
where I would just as soon
not take a commission.

1038
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:22,100
That's great. Thank you.
That's great.
Thank you for that.

1039
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:24,000
I wish I didn't have to,
you know,

1040
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,900
but company policy says
I cannot waive that.

1041
00:53:27,700 --> 00:53:29,800
But I was just...
You know, I'm saying
in theory, you know.

1042
00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:34,300
In this situation,
'cause we're friends,
I wish I could waive it.

1043
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:35,800
No can do, though.

1044
00:53:36,100 --> 00:53:40,100
As soon as you can,
I would love to get
a set of keys from you guys.

1045
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:43,100
You just drop them off.
Okay. Great. There they are.

1046
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:45,300
I'll be bringing by
people all week.

1047
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:49,400
You won't even know I'm here.
The good news is,
should move quickly.

1048
00:53:49,900 --> 00:53:51,100
All right.

1049
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:54,200
Okay to leave you two
alone now?

1050
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:57,900
Got to get back to Jen.
Very excited about
the win tonight.

1051
00:53:59,100 --> 00:54:00,200
Okay.

1052

(DOOR CLOSING)

1054
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:17,500
BROOKE: Addie,
if the condo sells,
I think I'm gonna lose him.

1055
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:19,200
ADDIE ON PHONE:
<i>Yeah, but game night</i>
<i>was so light and fun,</i>

1056
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:21,400
<i>I'm really surprised</i>
<i>to be hearing this.</i>

1057
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:23,700
Okay. You know what?
That's not constructive.
Really.

1058
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:26,200
I just... Yeah, I need
a new plan, Addie. I don't...

1059
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:27,600
(SNICKERING)

1060
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:30,600
I'm just kidding. It's me.

1061
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:32,800
I'm gonna have to
call you back.

1062
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:37,200
Whenever one of my friends
is down, we all go on,
like, happy patrol.

1063
00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:39,500
I was actually having
a very serious conversation.

1064
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:40,900
(SINGING)
Christopher, do not sing.

(DOOR SLAMS)

1069
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,100
Pack up your shit and go home.

1070
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:00,700
Okay. You know what?
This is not his fault.

1071
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:03,700
He was just really trying
to cheer me up and it...

1072
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:12,300
Did I or did I not give you
the day off to be sad?

1073
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:14,900
Yes. But I...
Well, today's not that day,

1074
00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:18,200
and unfortunately for you,
I can't afford to look weak.

1075
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:19,400
No, please.

1076
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:23,300
You have warned me
so many times
and you have yet to fire me.

1077
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:27,400
I think you and I both know
that to find and train
somebody new,

1078
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:30,200
it's gonna cost you time,
and it's gonna cost you money,

1079
00:55:30,300 --> 00:55:33,400
and I don't think you want
to spend either one of those.

1080
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:37,600
Now, look, I'm just gonna
take a wild guess here,

1081
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:40,900
but you don't become
Marilyn Dean

1082
00:55:41,900 --> 00:55:44,000
without knowing
how to handle men.

1083
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:48,300
Okay? Now, just listen
to my problem,

1084
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:52,100
tell me how to fix it,
and then we'll all
go back to work.

1085
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:58,000
Okay. What is this problem
so severe

1086
00:55:58,600 --> 00:56:02,700
that has caused you to
blaspheme in the synagogue
of Marilyn Dean?

1087
00:56:03,700 --> 00:56:07,400
Well, it's Gary.
I broke up with him

1088
00:56:08,300 --> 00:56:12,900
in hopes that losing me
would make him
want to change,

1089
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
and that's, you know...

1090
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:19,500
And I've just ended up
pushing him, you know,
farther and farther away.

1091
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:24,000
That's it?
Yeah.

1092
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:29,800
Honey, this is not
surrealism or cubism,
it's paint-by-numbers.

1093
00:56:31,700 --> 00:56:35,700
Go see Mischa,
my personal waxer at the spa.

1094
00:56:35,900 --> 00:56:38,400
Ask her for the Telly Savalas.

1095
00:56:39,700 --> 00:56:41,500
The Telly Savalas.

1096
00:56:42,100 --> 00:56:43,900
Compliments of M. Dean.

1097
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:48,900
Then go show Gary
your immaculate canvas

1098
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:52,800
and let him see another man

You push yourself
trying to achieve
the impossible,

1278
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:17,700

that when that moment comes

1279
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:22,100
that everything you've done
up to that moment
has prepared you for victory!

just wanted you, you know,
to show her the respect

of not standing her up
or some shit, who knows?

after me and you broke up,

it all kind of really hit me.

And I think
it partially hit me

always our day that we
would do stuff together.

Brooke, that I don't always
do the right thing

or always say
the right things,

1567
01:28:19,700 --> 01:28:22,500
but I am willing to try
to do things differently.

1568
01:28:22,700 --> 01:28:25,200
And I'd be happy to go
take a dance class.

01:28:25,300 --> 01:28:28,900
Well, I would. Honestly.
I would like to go do that.

to go to the ballet.

do the dance class
or take a trip somewhere.

But I realize
that's not the point.

I realize that the point
isn't that at all,

1574

because it's not really
about doing things
that you love to do always,

01:28:59,400 --> 01:29:01,300
I've missed you so much.

(SOBBING)

1580
01:29:04,600 --> 01:29:06,000
I promise you, Brooke,

1581
01:29:06,100 --> 01:29:10,500
I will do whatever it is
that I have to do
to never hurt you again.

1582
01:29:11,500 --> 01:29:15,300
I love you and I'm sorry.

1583
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:21,100
Okay, that's it.
That's all I...

1584
01:29:22,900 --> 01:29:24,600
Oh, God.
That's all I wanted to say,

1585
01:29:24,700 --> 01:29:28,300
so you can go ahead now
with anything that
you're feeling to say.

1586
01:29:31,800 --> 01:29:33,500
I don't know what to say.

1587
01:29:34,600 --> 01:29:36,800
Just say whatever
you feel inside.

1588
01:29:44,600 --> 01:29:46,900
I don't feel the same way.

1589
01:29:51,300 --> 01:29:53,700
I don't. I just...
I don't know.

1590
01:29:54,800 --> 01:29:56,100
Oh, God.

1591
01:29:58,300 --> 01:30:01,300
I just, I think...
I don't know,

1592
01:30:01,400 --> 01:30:03,600
but I don't think I have

1593
01:30:04,100 --> 01:30:07,700
anything left to give.

1594
01:30:10,300 --> 01:30:11,700
I'm sorry.

1595
01:30:18,900 --> 01:30:20,700
I was hoping for...

1596
01:30:25,200 --> 01:30:26,600
It doesn't matter.

1597
01:30:32,500 --> 01:30:34,700
Oh, this is now
beyond awkward.

1598
01:30:34,700 --> 01:30:37,500
There's some new guy
standing out in the hallway

1599
01:30:37,600 --> 01:30:41,500
and I think I'm gonna go.

1600
01:30:46,500 --> 01:30:47,700
Okay.

1601
01:30:51,400 --> 01:30:52,900
Thank you.

1602
01:30:56,600 --> 01:30:59,300
I made a dinner,
and I don't know if
it's any good or not,

1603
01:30:59,400 --> 01:31:01,300
but you're welcome to have it.

1604
01:31:02,700 --> 01:31:03,800
Okay.

1605
01:31:08,600 --> 01:31:11,300
Gary, that's really...
That's not what
you think that it is.

1606
01:31:11,400 --> 01:31:12,500
It's okay.

1607
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:15,900
I'm gonna go take a walk.

01:31:40,300 --> 01:31:42,600
I'm sorry about that.
No.

1612
01:31:42,900 --> 01:31:46,200
I'm sorry I imposed.
No, that's fine. Please.

1613
01:31:47,800 --> 01:31:51,700
So, what do you think?
I think you're right.

1614
01:31:51,800 --> 01:31:54,100
I think it's great.
Good.

1615
01:31:54,800 --> 01:31:56,400
Okay.
Okay.

1616
01:31:56,500 --> 01:31:57,600
So,

1617
01:31:59,400 --> 01:32:02,400
I will have that wrapped up.

1618
01:32:02,500 --> 01:32:05,200
Packed up, sorry,
and delivered.

1619
01:32:06,100 --> 01:32:08,000
Thank you for taking the time
to show it to me, okay?

1620
01:32:08,100 --> 01:32:09,200
Sure.

1621
01:32:09,400 --> 01:32:12,000
Yeah. I'm gonna run.
Okay, I'll walk you out.

1622

GARY: So, the thing that
I was most afraid
of happening happened

1626
01:32:31,500 --> 01:32:36,100
and I don't regret it at all,
because now she knows
how I feel.

1627
01:32:38,400 --> 01:32:41,100
Do you know what I mean?
Yeah.

1628
01:32:41,200 --> 01:32:45,400
I think,
what you got to do now
is really think hard,

1629
01:32:46,400 --> 01:32:48,500
because you have
to find somebody

1630
01:32:49,600 --> 01:32:52,100
that can't be traced back
to either of us

1631
01:32:53,300 --> 01:32:55,000
to visit this guy.

1632
01:32:55,500 --> 01:32:57,600
What are you talking about?
I don't...

1633
01:32:57,700 --> 01:32:59,400
The guy who came with her.

1634
01:32:59,500 --> 01:33:01,900
I don't need anything
to happen to the guy.

1635
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:03,700
But if they could trace him
back to either one of us...

1636
01:33:03,700 --> 01:33:05,900
It's not about him.
I don't care about that.
...it's a problem.

1637
01:33:05,900 --> 01:33:08,500
The guy, he's not a...
They're not dumb.
Cops are smart, trust me.

1638
01:33:08,600 --> 01:33:10,500
Okay, but he's not
a problem to me.
Right.

1639
01:33:10,600 --> 01:33:12,400
Listen to me.

1640
01:33:12,500 --> 01:33:15,900
Promise me that you're
not gonna do anything.

1641
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:17,100
I got you.

1642
01:33:17,700 --> 01:33:20,100
It's better if nobody...
You don't know anything.

1643
01:33:20,200 --> 01:33:21,700
What are you talking about?
I'll take care of it.

1644
01:33:21,700 --> 01:33:23,700
I don't want you
to take care of anything.
John, do me a favor.

1645
01:33:23,800 --> 01:33:26,800
I'm being serious with you.
I know, I know.
Smart. You're smart.

1646
01:33:26,900 --> 01:33:28,200
No, I'm not.
I'm being honest with you.

1647
01:33:28,300 --> 01:33:29,700
I don't want anything
to happen to him.
Me, either.

1648
01:33:29,800 --> 01:33:31,800
Promise me you're not
gonna have anyone
do anything to this guy.

1649
01:33:31,900 --> 01:33:33,800
But you've gotta
tell me exactly
what you're gonna tell them,

1650
01:33:33,900 --> 01:33:35,800
if the cops come to you.
Because if we tell
a different story...

1651
01:33:35,900 --> 01:33:37,700
Nothing.
Promise me one thing.
We don't care...

1652
01:33:37,700 --> 01:33:39,700
John, I'm gonna go home.
I can't do this.
I'm exhausted.

1653
01:33:39,800 --> 01:33:42,100
Right, go home. Just make sure
your neighbors know
you're going home.

1654
01:33:42,200 --> 01:33:45,900
Do me a favor.
They got phone records. Make
a couple phone calls tonight.

1655
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:47,700
Especially around 10:00.

1656
01:33:48,600 --> 01:33:51,100
Okay. Please don't
do anything. All right.

1657
01:33:51,200 --> 01:33:52,800
I don't mean it like...
I mean, honestly.

1658
01:33:52,900 --> 01:33:54,300
No, no, I got it.

1659
01:33:58,800 --> 01:34:01,100
For all you know,
nothing's happening.

1660
01:34:01,600 --> 01:34:03,900
I don't want anything
to happen.
Right.

1661
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:05,400
Say it louder.

1662
01:35:34,400 --> 01:35:36,500
What are you doing here
so early?

1663
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:00,100
Hey.

1664
01:36:03,300 --> 01:36:06,500
Everything okay
with you and...
Yeah, everything's
gonna be great.

1665
01:36:06,600 --> 01:36:11,100
I just wanna get
my day started,
but I just wanted to say that

1666
01:36:11,900 --> 01:36:14,600
I'm sorry it took
so long for me to...

1667
01:36:16,300 --> 01:36:17,800
I love you, Dennis.

1668
01:36:19,800 --> 01:36:22,000
(GASPING)
It's all right. It's okay.

1669
01:36:23,600 --> 01:36:26,500
I'm sorry. I'm gonna go
do the stuff.

1670
01:36:53,100 --> 01:36:55,100
So, that's it
for all my stuff.

1671
01:36:58,200 --> 01:37:02,300
If you want, you could give me
your key and I'll drop it off
at Riggleman's.

1672
01:37:02,800 --> 01:37:04,100
All right.

1673
01:37:13,400 --> 01:37:14,600
Thanks.

1674
01:37:15,800 --> 01:37:16,800
Gary.

1675
01:37:17,700 --> 01:37:21,200
You know, there's
a thousand things I...

1676
01:37:22,200 --> 01:37:24,200
I would have done differently.

1677
01:37:26,300 --> 01:37:27,500
Me, too.

1678
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:34,000
Sort of, actually,
when I see this space, I
realize that if we didn't have

1679
01:37:34,100 --> 01:37:37,900
such a big coffee table
and that oversized couch

1680
01:37:39,300 --> 01:37:43,700
a pool table
would have fit nicely.

1681
01:37:43,900 --> 01:37:45,000
Yeah.

1682
01:37:45,800 --> 01:37:50,800
Although the oversized couch
did come in very useful the
last couple of weeks, so...

1683
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:52,600
Yes, it... I guess.

1684
01:37:58,600 --> 01:38:00,000
Have a good trip.

1685
01:38:02,400 --> 01:38:03,700

Wow.

(CHUCKLES)

1715
01:39:51,200 --> 01:39:54,100
It's good to see you.
It's good to see you.

1716
01:39:54,200 --> 01:39:58,500
I'd give you a hug,
but my hands are kind of
full with all the bags here.

1717
01:40:00,900 --> 01:40:03,200
How've you been?
I've been really good.

1718

How have you been?
I've been good.

1719
01:40:06,400 --> 01:40:07,600
Yeah.

You look great.
Thank you.

1721
01:40:10,700 --> 01:40:14,000
The hair's a little different.
Looks nice.
Yeah? Oh, yeah.

1722
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:18,600
You've lost some weight.
Well, it's very
deceiving, actually.

I've managed to become thin
without having any real muscle
on me whatsoever.

Very tough thing to
accomplish, by the way.
I'm proud of myself.

Well, you look terrific.
Thanks.

I heard your trip
went really well.
It did. It went really well.

1727
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:35,600
Oh, good.
It was fun. It was amazing.

1728
01:40:35,600 --> 01:40:38,200
I saw so many amazing places.
It was just...

1729
01:40:38,600 --> 01:40:42,800
But, you know,
you do realize
how much you love home.

1730
01:40:43,500 --> 01:40:46,900
It's good to have you back.
Yeah. It's good to be back.

1731
01:40:49,700 --> 01:40:52,700
And the boat.
Congratulations on the boat.
Thanks.

I'm waiting for it
to get warm, and I'm gonna
come by and take a ride.

01:40:55,800 --> 01:40:58,600
Well, anytime you want.
It'll be on the house.
Come on by.

1734
01:40:58,700 --> 01:41:00,800
Well, I will, then.

1735
01:41:02,200 --> 01:41:03,700
I hope you do.

1736
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:06,200
Definitely.

1737
01:41:10,200 --> 01:41:13,100
Well, I got to...
I'm going to a meeting, so...

1738
01:41:13,100 --> 01:41:17,900
I got to drop these bags
off anyway, but it's really
good to see you, Brooke.

1739
01:41:18,400 --> 01:41:21,000
Really good to see you.
Shouldn't...

1740
01:41:21,800 --> 01:41:23,200
Sorry.
I'm sorry.

1741
01:41:23,300 --> 01:41:26,700
I'm just saying we shouldn't
wait so long the next time
before we...

1742
01:41:26,700 --> 01:41:28,100
Yeah.
...catch up.

1743
01:41:28,200 --> 01:41:30,600
We have a lot more
to talk about.
Yeah.

1744
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:32,000
So.

1745
01:41:33,300 --> 01:41:34,900
Be good.
Okay.

1746
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:36,200
Bye.
Bye.

1747
01:41:41,900 --> 01:41:44,500

1748
