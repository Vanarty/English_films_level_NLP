1
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,700
I have found almost everything
ever written about love...

2
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:12,200
...to be true.

3
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,400
Shakespeare said,
"Journeys end in lovers meeting."

4
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,400
What an extraordinary thought.

5
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:22,000
Personally, I have not experienced
anything remotely close to that...

6
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,300
...but I'm more than willing to believe
Shakespeare had.

7
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,800
I suppose I think about love
more than anyone really should.

8
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,500
I'm constantly amazed by its sheer
power to alter and define our lives.

9
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,700
It was Shakespeare who also said,
"Love is blind."

10
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Now, that is something
I know to be true.

11
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:58,400
For some, quite inexplicably...

12
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,700
...love fades.

13
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,000
For others...

14
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,300
...love is simply lost.

15
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:29,200
But then, of course,
love can also be found.

16
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,600
Even if just for the night.

17
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,700
And then there's
another kind of love.

18
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,400
The cruelest kind.

19
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,300
The one that almost kills its victims.

20
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,400
It's called unrequited love.

21
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:51,700
Of that, I am an expert...

22
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:56,000
Most love stories are about people
who fall in love with each other.

23
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:59,500
But what about the rest of us?
What about our stories?

24
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:02,100
Those of us who fall in love alone.

25
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:05,400
We are the victims
of the one-sided affair.

26
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,500
We are the cursed
of the loved ones.

27
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:10,400
We are the unloved ones.
The walking wounded.

28
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:14,100
The handicapped without the
advantage of a great parking space.

29
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,800
Yes, you are looking at one
such individual.

30
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
And I have willingly loved...

31
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:23,000
...that man for over
three miserable years.

32
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,500
The absolute worst years of my life.

33
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,900
The worst Christmases,
the worst birthdays.

34
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:31,700
New Year's Eves brought in
by tears and Valium.

35
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:35,900
These years I've been in love have
been the darkest days of my life...

36
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:39,300
...all because I'm cursed by being
in love with a man who does not...

37
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,900
...and will not love me back.

38
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,600
Oh, God, just the sight of him.

39
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:47,300
Heart. Pounding, throat thickening,
absolutely can't swallow.

40
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:50,200
All the usual symptoms.

41
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,100
Oh, Jasper.

42
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,800
- Don't tell me you're still...
- No, no, no, that's over. Very over.

43
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,300
What's the story with you two anyway?
You were shagging him, weren't you?

44
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:03,000
More importantly, I was in love
with him, truth be known.

45
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,900
Then you found out he was shagging
that drip from Circulation.

46
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:09,100
Which is when I stopped
shagging him.

47
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:11,700
We shouldn't be talking
about this at the office party.

48
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:14,300
But I always see you two together.

49
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,200
He cheated on you,
but you stayed friends?

50
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:22,400
I was head over heels, you know?
Everyone knew.

51
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:25,400
- Does it look like I'm crying right now?
- No, no, no.

52
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:28,600
No, it just looks like it's the smoke
from my cigarette.

53
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:32,300
Did he ever actually tell you
that he loved you back?

54
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:36,800
Yes. Three, almost four times.
And when I reminded him of that...

55
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,300
...he said it must have been an answer
to a question.

56
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:42,900
Which, by the way,
it absolutely was not.

57
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:47,200
You know, Iris, when you catch
your guy with another woman...

58
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,500
...you're not supposed
to stay friends with him.

59
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:51,800
You're supposed to never
talk to the prick again.

60
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,300
You're supposed to throw things
at him, scream, call him names.

61
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,000
Not do his blooming laundry.

62
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,700
I don't do his laundry.

63
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,700
Did someone tell you
I do his laundry?

64
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:04,100
No, no, all we do now is...

65
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,800
...we e-mail.

66
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,700
Not when he's with her, of course.

67
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:12,500
Also when he's not with her,
we talk on the phone.

68
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:17,100
Sometimes for hours. And then
there's the occasional long lunch.

69
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:20,100
You know, I never realized
how pathetic you are.

70
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:21,800
Really?

71
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:25,200
Oh, God. I'm so aware of it.

72
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,800
They always know just
how to get us, don't they?

73
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,200
He knows whenever he wants
back in your life...

74
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,400
Actually, he has made some small
comments like that recently.

75
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,600
He hasn't exactly come
right out and said it...

76
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,700
Iris, did you file your story?

77
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:42,300
Oh, no, not yet.
Down to the wire. Sorry.

78
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,300
Better go.

79
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:50,100
...groom's best friend spoke...

80
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:54,900
...for many guests
when he said, "Hilary...

81
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:59,000
...will open Edward's eyes...

82
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:02,600
...and round out his life."

83
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,400
Okay, I've got a question for you.

84
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,700
What's it like to be the only one
committed to work...

85
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:13,500
...while the rest of us
are slumming?

86
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:15,600
You mean what's it like
to be the only one...

87
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,600
...not to finish their work on time?

88
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,500
Hold on. Don't... Don't go.

89
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,500
Is it fun having a brain
that works that fast?

90
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,600
- Shut up.
- No, I mean it.

91
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,700
Probably a brilliant finish too.

92
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:31,000
I assure you it's not.

93
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:35,300
- Hi, Simpkey.
- Hi.

94
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:40,400
Your column today was fantastic.

95
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:43,100
God, I loved that line:

96
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:48,400
"The onrushing stripping of dignity
and thought from British lives."

97
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,500
Great writing.

98
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:53,300
Hey, I got you something
for Christmas.

99
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:57,000
That's convenient
because I got you something too.

100
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,700
Darling, I don't actually
have my gift with me.

101
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:06,000
In fact, I probably mislaid it,
but I know I got you something.

102
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,900
I suspect it's somewhere in my car,
want to know what it is?

103
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,600
No. No, no, that's okay.

104
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,800
I know you're gonna look hot in it.

105
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,800
Well, let's hope you find it, then.

106
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,900
Not exactly something hot...

107
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:23,900
...but happy Christmas.

108
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,200
Thank you.

109
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,800
I didn't think we'd get a chance
to do this this year.

110
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,300
Remember last Christmas,
we exchanged gifts in March.

111
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,300
This is good.

112
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,200
We're getting better.

113
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,000
You stinker.

114
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,800
It's a first edition.

115
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,500
Where did you find it?

116
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:53,900
Buried in that little place we found
in Covent Garden that time.

117
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,500
Why are you so great?

118
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:03,100
Everyone, can I have
your attention, please?

119
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,700
Just a couple of minutes.
Thank you.

120
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,600
I hate it that we can never talk.

121
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,000
Hate it.

122
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:16,900
Well, first of all, a very
happy Christmas to every one of you.

123
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,300
Happy Christmas.

124
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:22,200
Now, we're not officially closed,
as you very well know.

125
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,400
But we are going to try
and get by this week...

126
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:27,300
...with a smaller-than-normal staff.

127
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,300
Now, before some of you
rush off on holiday...

128
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:35,200
...I do have one
rather important announcement.

129
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,100
Now, this affects Iris.

130
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:40,600
- Iris Simpkins, where are you?
- Here, sir.

131
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,500
- Iris, I have a tip for you.
- Excellent.

132
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:46,900
A wedding was privately
announced earlier today...

133
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:50,500
...that I don't believe any other paper
in town knows about.

134
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:55,200
And I want you to be the first to report
on this particular union...

135
00:08:55,400 --> 00:09:00,400
...as it is between two of our
most esteemed colleagues.

136
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:04,500
May I introduce the newly engaged
Sarah Smith-Alcott...

137
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:08,300
...and Jasper Bloom!

138
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,100
Come on.

139
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:24,800
If I had known this was going
to happen, I'd have worn my good suit.

140
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,500
Amanda!

141
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,300
Amanda.

142
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:39,000
Look, may I just say again...

143
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:41,600
...that I did not sleep with her?

144
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:45,400
Right, because your receptionist
needs to work till 3 in the morning.

145
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,700
A bunch of us were working all night.
She wanted to hang out.

146
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:52,300
Okay. Then swear on my life
that you didn't sleep with her.

147
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,100
Come on.

148
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:55,400
Go ahead.

149
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,800
Look, I don't wanna...
I'm not gonna...

150
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,700
Your receptionist, Ethan?

151
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,400
This is why I knew we were smart
never to get married.

152
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,700
I told you never to get rid
of your house.

153
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:07,300
Somewhere inside
I knew this about you.

154
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,800
First of all, can you please
calm down?

155
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,600
Because I did not
sleep with her.

156
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,900
Secondly, we've had problems
for over a year.

157
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,600
And I know you don't wanna deal
with that, but we have.

158
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,800
Oh, I am well aware we've
had problems for the last year.

159
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,800
If I work a little bit too much,
I never stop hearing about it.

160
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,400
But if you work too much,
maestro...

161
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,500
...it's for the sake of your music.
- "If" you work too much?

162
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,500
Amanda, you cut
75 trailers this year.

163
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:33,700
You put a cutting room in the house
and sleep with your BlackBerry.

164
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:36,100
And I'm not gonna have
a conversation about sex...

165
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:38,200
...because I can't remember
the last time we did it.

166
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,900
Come on, nobody has time for sex.

167
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:43,600
That's not entirely true.

168
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:46,500
That's it!
You absolutely slept with her!

169
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,400
Seriously, you have to get out.

170
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,600
Oh, God.

171
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,700
You know what I really think, Ethan?

172
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:54,800
- I don't think you ever really loved me.
- Oh, please.

173
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,500
You loved the idea of you and me, but
not so much me. Not me, not really.

174
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:03,400
Look, I did the best I could.
Is anybody good enough for that job?

175
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:08,400
I will send you your things.

176
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,100
You know you do this, right?

177
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:15,300
I mean, you screw up
every relationship you've ever been in.

178
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,000
It's what you do.

179
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,300
You didn't really wanna be a couple!
You resist it in your own way!

180
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,800
Shut up!

181
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,100
And it's hard to detect
how you even do it...

182
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:29,000
...because nobody's quite
as smart as you!

183
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,400
So you're hard to catch at it.

184
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,400
But it always surfaces
and this is what happens.

185
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,900
- What happens?
- Things end.

186
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,800
Just like you knew they would.

187
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,200
Amanda, you know how I feel
about you. There's nobody like you.

188
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,300
You just don't wanna be
what I need.

189
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,900
- Well, not what I "need."
- What?

190
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:48,100
I mean...
You know what I mean.

191
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:51,600
You know, I would never cheat on you,
not under any conditions.

192
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:53,400
Neither would I, okay?

193
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,500
Look at me. I'm down here
sweating like a pig. And look at you.

194
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:59,400
The only woman on Earth
who breaks up with her boyfriend...

195
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,800
...and doesn't even shed a tear?

196
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I mean,
that's gotta mean something, right?

197
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:07,300
Why does it bug you so much
that I can't cry?

198
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,400
Esophageal spasm.

199
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,700
Oh, God, it's a big one.

200
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:20,300
- No, it's okay. I'll be all right.
- I know, I know. I'm thinking about me.

201
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:23,000
Ethan. Look, it's over.

202
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,900
You know, we might as well
be honest with each other.

203
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:28,100
Just tell me.

204
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,800
Did you sleep with her?

205
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,200
Just say it.

206
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:37,000
What's the difference at this point,
right? I mean, why torture me?

207
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:40,400
Just put me out of my misery.

208
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,400
- What are we doing here...?
- Okay.

209
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:53,300
Yes, okay? I slept with her.
Are you happy?

210
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:57,600
I've been sleeping with her.
She's in love with me. She's young.

211
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:00,600
Look, this is not a proud moment
for me.

212
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,700
I mean, you should just know that.

213
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:07,100
Amanda!

214
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:16,100
Did you say, am I happy?

215
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:19,600
I didn't mean that. You get me nuts
sometimes, I say things I don't mean.

216
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,600
In the world of love, Ethan...

217
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,500
...not that I'm such a genius at it...

218
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:26,700
...but in the world of love,
cheating is not acceptable.

219
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,300
No matter what you think...

220
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:32,300
I know you have a very high opinion
of yourself, but this isn't all me.

221
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:35,100
- Okay.
- So when you're not in such a rage...

222
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:37,700
...I think you'll see that too.
- Yeah, maybe.

223
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:41,500
Maybe when I stop having visions
of you two together...

224
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:43,400
...I will see your side.

225
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:49,300
You gotta be...

226
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,000
Punched him in the face.

227
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,900
- Is this a bad time?
- No, no, I'm just...

228
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:08,300
- I'm just flipping out a little bit.
- Oh, okay.

229
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:11,600
God. Okay... No. I'm okay.
God, why would this happen?

230
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,900
No. You know what? I'm all right.

231
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:16,400
Hi.

232
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,700
What's up?

233
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:20,200
Ben needs you.

234
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,100
Rebecca Green was just your
average 20-year-old.

235
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:27,500
Until the father she never knew left
her something she never expected.

236
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:29,400
Don't scream.

237
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,000
- Your father left you something.
- I never met my father.

238
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,900
- Now you know he was interesting.
- Lindsay Lohan.

239
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:37,200
James Franco.

240
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,300
- Deception.
- You happen to have two guns?

241
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,400
I didn't think one would be enough.

242
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,800
Christmas Day.

243
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,000
Amazing! It finally looks like a hit.

244
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,000
And that is why they pay you
the big bucks.

245
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,800
I think we should go back
to the original cut on the end.

246
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,600
- It's so much stronger.
- I agree.

247
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,100
And make "Christmas Day"
twice as big...

248
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:00,800
...but try it in a red. Like a happy red,
not like a Scorsese red.

249
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,400
Happy red.

250
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,600
Okay, so we're done.

251
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:09,200
- Great.
- All right.

252
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:12,900
Hey, you know, let's just take off
for a few weeks.

253
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,500
- Yeah.
- What do you mean? I'm not kidding.

254
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:18,500
You always say that
this is our busiest time.

255
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:20,700
I need to get out of town.

256
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:23,300
You know? I think I need
some peace and quiet...

257
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,200
...or whatever it is people
go away for.

258
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,200
You know what I really wanna do?

259
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,700
I wanna eat carbs without
wanting to kill myself.

260
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:36,200
I wanna read a book.
Not just a magazine. An actual book.

261
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:40,500
For years, I read these reviews,
I buy the books, but I never read them.

262
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:43,500
Did you read that article in
The New York Times last Sunday?

263
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:46,700
Severe stress makes women
age prematurely...

264
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,400
...because stress causes DNA
in our cells to shrink...

265
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,300
...until they can no longer replicate.

266
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,400
So when we're stressed,
we look haggard.

267
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,700
- This is just women, not men.
- I'm sorry.

268
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:58,000
They used to say that...

269
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:01,400
...single women over 35 were
more likely to be killed by a terrorist...

270
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,400
...than to get married.
That was horrible.

271
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,500
But now our generation
is also not getting married.

272
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:10,000
And bonus, real terrorists
actually became part of our lives.

273
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:13,700
So the stress of it all shows up on our
faces, making us look haggard.

274
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:16,100
While Ethan goes on
looking cute forever...

275
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,000
...shtupping his
24-year-old receptionist!

276
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:21,300
Oh, my God!

277
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,100
See what I mean?

278
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:25,800
I need a vacation.

279
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:28,800
Okay, where do I wanna go?

280
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,700
By myself at Christmas.

281
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:36,300
By myself depressed at Christmas.

282
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:40,200
All alone on vacation.

283
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:44,700
Alone, alone.

284
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:47,400
Totally alone.

285
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:05,300
Please, just give me one.

286
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:06,800
One tear.

287
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:17,700
Okay. Moving on.

288
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,500
"Worry-Free vacations."

289
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,600
Good. Where's that?

290
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,600
Bora Bora.

291
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:29,300
"Kayak for one?" No, thank you.

292
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:33,000
"Vacation Rentals." I could do that.

293
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,200
Hole up in a house somewhere.
Disappear for a few weeks.

294
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,900
I like that idea.

295
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:40,500
"Where do you wanna go
on your next vacation?"

296
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,200
"Click here and pick a country."

297
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,700
Where do they speak English?

298
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,300
"Click on a town or city."

299
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,300
Let's see. Cotswolds.

300
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:54,200
"Barn converted to modern house
in the beautiful Cotswolds."

301
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:57,600
Which looks exactly like the valley.

302
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,500
Surrey. "Christmas in the country."

303
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:04,700
"A fairy-tale English cottage
set in a tranquil country garden.

304
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,600
Snuggle up by an old stone fireplace
and enjoy a cup of cocoa.

305
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:13,800
An enchanting oasis of tranquility
in a quiet English hamlet...

306
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,200
...just 40 minutes
from exciting London."

307
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:20,100
Yeah.

308
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:08,200
What am I doing?

309
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:15,600
Low point.

310
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,900
Low point.

311
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:29,600
"I'm interested... Renting your house.

312
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:34,400
I'm wondering if your house
is available this Christmas.

313
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:39,300
Because if it is,
you could be a real lifesaver."

314
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,200
"I know it's late to be asking...

315
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:48,600
...but if you're at all interested,
please contact me."

316
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:58,800
"I'm very interested, but the cottage
is only available for home exchange."

317
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,300
"Home exchange"? What is that?

318
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,600
"We switch houses, cars,
everything.

319
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:06,000
I haven't done it before,
but friends have."

320
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:09,100
Where are you?

321
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:13,500
Please say somewhere far away.

322
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,400
"L.A."

323
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,700
Never been there.
Always wanted to go.

324
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,100
I'm Iris, by the way.

325
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I'm very normal.

326
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:33,400
Neat freak. Healthy. Non-smoker.

327
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:35,400
Single.

328
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:39,900
Hate my horrible life.

329
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:42,300
I'm Amanda.

330
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,700
Loner, loser and complicated wreck.

331
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:46,600
Hi.

332
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:48,600
Hi.

333
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:53,700
I must say...

334
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,500
...your house looks idyllic.

335
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:59,500
"Just what I need." Really?

336
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,900
What does your place look like?

337
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:06,800
My place is nice,
but it's a little bigger than yours.

338
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:26,000
"Are there any men in your town?"

339
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:30,300
Honestly?

340
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,200
"Tomorrow's perfect."

341
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,700
Okay. We are on for two weeks...

342
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:10,300
...starting tomorrow.

343
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,100
Hi.

344
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:27,600
- Hi.
- How are you?

345
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:32,000
- Fine.
- Honey, we're sitting there.

346
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:35,600
Sorry.

347
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,100
Oh, yes. There it is.

348
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:45,200
- Well, hello, dear.
- Hello.

349
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,900
Excuse me.

350
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,500
There we go.

351
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,000
- I'm so sorry.
- No, no, it's okay.

352
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,900
- Did you step on her foot?
- It's okay.

353
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:55,600
Oh, dear. Clumsy me.

354
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:29,500
Amanda Woods is proud to present
Her Life.

355
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:31,700
- She had it all;
- Yes, that's it.

356
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:33,900
The job. The house.

357
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:35,900
The guy.

358
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:37,500
This holiday season...

359
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:42,000
...find out
what Amanda doesn't have.

360
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,400
This is amazing, this is amazing!

361
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:24,100
Oh, look at that.

362
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:55,400
Madam?

363
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,600
Madam?

364
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:02,500
- Madam?
- Yeah.

365
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:03,900
- We're here.
- Okay.

366
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:15,700
This can't be it.

367
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,200
No, it's just down that lane.

368
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:22,000
But the thing is, I'll never be able
to turn this around at the other end.

369
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,900
Think you can make it from here?

370
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,000
No.

371
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,700
Hey. You wouldn't happen to know
where Rosehill Cottage is?

372
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:55,000
Go right at the bridge, and then
just keep going. Way down there.

373
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,800
Okay.

374
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:22,800
I'm here!

375
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:42,100
Holy shit.

376
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:07,600
Oh, my God!

377
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:53,400
Okay, that'll be interesting.

378
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:04,000
Get in the... Get in there. Okay.

379
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:05,800
Cute dress.

380
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:09,300
Oh, suitcase.

381
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:17,900
Okay.

382
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:22,000
Now what?

383
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:25,800
I can do this.

384
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:28,700
I can drive
on the wrong side of the road...

385
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:30,400
...and the wrong side of the car.

386
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,700
Just stay focused.

387
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:36,000
Oh, please do not hit me!

388
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:40,800
Okay, I hate this.

389
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,500
Oh, God.

390
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,300
Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no.

391
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:58,300
- Move out of the way!
- Watch it!

392
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,600
Sorry. Stop!

393
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,900
Oh, God.

394
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,600
I need a drink.

395
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:31,400
Someone's having a party tonight.

396
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,200
Oh, yeah.

397
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,600
- They went to the shops.
- Didn't see anything.

398
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:42,400
Came home,
and had a bit of a kiss and cuddle.

399
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:43,500
The end.

400
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:46,700
Rebecca Green
was just your average 20-year-old.

401
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:48,600
Until the father she never knew...

402
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,800
...left her something
she never expected.

403
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:54,000
- You happen to have two guns?
- I didn't think one would be enough.

404
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,300
Deception. Christmas Day.

405
00:32:56,800 --> 00:33:01,000
And that's why they pay me
the big bucks.

406
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:04,000
And now the weather. First,
Nort. Hern England and Nort. H Wales...

407
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:07,300
...will have sleet or snow in the
morning and again later in the day.

408
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:56,500
Blinked.

409
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,800
Oh, that's intense.

410
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:48,400
Oh, no. "Gate"?

411
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:56,800
- Who was he with?
- Maggie.

412
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,300
- The flutes. This is the best part.
- One second.

413
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:01,600
Hello... Hello?

414
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:06,300
- Hello? Can you hear me?
- Yeah, it's Miles. Amanda?

415
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:09,000
No, I'm sorry.
Amanda's not here, I'm afraid.

416
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:12,900
I'm trying to figure out
how to open the gate. Oh, fu...

417
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:15,100
very nice.

418
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:18,200
If you heard that, I'm sorry.

419
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,700
- Hi.
- Hi.

420
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:27,100
I'm so sorry.
I'm new at the gate thing.

421
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:28,800
It's okay. It was pretty funny.

422
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:32,300
I'm Miles. I work with Ethan.

423
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,100
Ethan?

424
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:36,800
- Amanda's ex.
- Oh, right.

425
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,500
Right.

426
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:41,000
Know when she'll be back?
Supposed to pick up things.

427
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,200
Amanda's in England,
actually, on holiday.

428
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,900
I'm staying here while she's away.

429
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:49,500
- You okay?
- Yes.

430
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:51,600
Yeah, something just
blew into my eye.

431
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:54,000
Oh, I hate that. Let me see.

432
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:57,500
Yep, you got something in
your eyelash. You want me to get it?

433
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
- Okay.
- Okay.

434
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,500
- Yeah, Santa Anas.
- Pardon?

435
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:06,100
The wind. It's what makes
it so warm this time of year.

436
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:09,200
Legend has it,
when the Santa Anas blow...

437
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:11,400
...all bets are off.
Anything can happen.

438
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:15,100
That's it. You okay?

439
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,900
Better. Thank you.

440
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:25,400
So you needed to...?

441
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,200
Pick up Ethan's laptop.

442
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,700
And you're his...?

443
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:32,300
Oh, well, I'm a film composer, too,
like Ethan, but...

444
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:35,200
- Did you compose this? It's beautiful.
- This?

445
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:37,000
Yes, I did. I wrote this.

446
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,500
No, I didn't. I wish I did.

447
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:42,800
This is the great Ennio Morricone.

448
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:44,800
Would you mind
coming back tomorrow?

449
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,200
I just want to check this
with Amanda's assistant.

450
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,400
Sure.

451
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,500
- I'm Iris, by the way.
- Miles.

452
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,200
- Right.
- And this is my Maggie.

453
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:57,400
I mean, just Maggie.
Not "my" Maggie.

454
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,400
- Hello.
- Hey.

455
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,100
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.

456
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:02,900
Okay.

457
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,300
Don't blow away.

458
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,400
I won't.

459
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:44,700
Anything can happen.

460
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:56,700
Five, six, seven, eight, nine,
10, 11, 12. One a. M. In London.

461
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:41,900
Who is it?

462
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:44,300
It's me. Hurry up. It's freezing.

463
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,300
- Who are you?
- Iris, open the door...

464
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:50,000
...or I swear I'm gonna take a leak
all over your...

465
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:55,900
You're not Iris.

466
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:59,300
Or if you are,
I'm much drunker than I realized.

467
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:01,300
I'm sorry for my profanity.

468
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:04,200
I wasn't expecting you.

469
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:08,000
Well, I wasn't expecting you either.

470
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:10,500
Nevertheless, may I just...?

471
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:15,300
Yeah. Of course. Sure.
You had to... Yeah.

472
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:18,500
I'm Graham. Iris' brother.

473
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,800
Brother.

474
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,900
I'm Amanda Woods.
I'm staying here.

475
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:25,000
Amandawoods?
Is that all one word?

476
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:28,100
No. No, it's not.

477
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:30,800
Brother? Oh, my God.

478
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:37,400
So Iris is... Where is...?
Where is she?

479
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:38,900
She didn't tell you?

480
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:42,300
She could have done...

481
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:46,200
...but as previously stated...

482
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:49,900
...I'm... I've just... I've been...

483
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:52,400
She's in Los Angeles.

484
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:55,900
That's not possible.
Iris never goes anywhere.

485
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:58,200
Well, we have that in common.

486
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:02,200
No, she listed this cottage on a
home-exchange website and I found it.

487
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:05,400
We switched houses for two weeks.
For the holiday.

488
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:09,400
She's in L.A. at my house
and I'm here.

489
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:12,100
- People actually do that?
- Apparently.

490
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:15,800
Yeah. I mean, it seems.
Here I am in my pajamas.

491
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:19,500
She did ring me last night. I didn't
get a chance to get back to her.

492
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:21,600
I feel awful now.

493
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,600
Would you mind if I sat?
I feel like I might bump into you.

494
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:29,100
Sure. Yeah. Sit.

495
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,000
You okay?

496
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:38,400
Yeah, I'm good.

497
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,400
Look, I'm sorry about the intrusion.

498
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:45,200
Although I may not appear it,
I am in fact Iris'...

499
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:47,700
...semi-respectable big brother.

500
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:51,500
But on the rare...
Or lately not-so-rare occasion...

501
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:54,100
...that I frequent the local pub...

502
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:57,700
...and get inordinately pissed,
my little sister puts me up...

503
00:41:58,100 --> 00:41:59,700
...so I don't get behind the wheel.

504
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:04,900
Pathetic explanation, but unfortunately
it's become a bit of a routine.

505
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:08,500
So how's it going so far?

506
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:11,300
I mean, up until I showed up
and ruined your night.

507
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:14,900
Well, it's not going so great.

508
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:17,100
Yeah, I'm leaving tomorrow
on a noon plane.

509
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:19,800
When did you get here?

510
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:23,400
About six hours ago.

511
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:26,200
We've made a great impression
on you, haven't we?

512
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,100
No, it's not that. It's just that...

513
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:30,500
You know,
I'm not quite myself right now.

514
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:32,400
I came here on a stupid whim.

515
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:35,900
Honestly, I've never thought about
anything less. It's very unlike me.

516
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:38,900
Would you like something to drink?

517
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:41,900
Glass of water? Tea?

518
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:43,100
Wine, maybe?

519
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:48,000
I think there's a bottle of brandy.
Fancy a glass?

520
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:51,300
- Sure.
- Good.

521
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:57,000
So... I'm sorry, I've totally blanked
and forgotten your name.

522
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:58,600
Amanda.

523
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,200
So, Amanda...

524
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:01,800
...you're not married, are you?

525
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:04,500
Why? Do I look not married?

526
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:09,000
No. It was just a backwards way
of asking if you were married.

527
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,100
No, not at all.

528
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,900
I don't know what that means.

529
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:17,700
I mean, no, I'm not married.

530
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:21,300
Me neither.

531
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:26,900
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

532
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:37,000
So is it horrible if I stay?

533
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:39,100
I'll be gone
before you even wake up.

534
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:41,600
I promise you will never
lay eyes on me again.

535
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:46,700
Of... No, that's fine. Sure.

536
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:49,200
- Thank you.
- Let me just get you a blanket.

537
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:51,700
In the cupboard,
on top of the Scrabble.

538
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:59,300
So why is it you aren't
quite yourself at the moment?

539
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:04,000
Well, I just broke up with someone.

540
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:05,600
Yesterday.

541
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:07,400
And I guess
what I was feeling...

542
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:10,000
...was that I didn't wanna be alone
over the holidays.

543
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:11,900
I thought that
if I was somewhere else...

544
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:13,600
...I wouldn't realize I was alone.

545
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:16,100
Then I got here
and never felt more alone in my life.

546
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:18,100
Big surprise.

547
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:20,100
Bet you're glad you knocked
on this door.

548
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:22,400
I am, actually.

549
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:27,100
Yeah, well...

550
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:31,700
Sorry and good night.

551
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:33,600
Sweet dreams.

552
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:42,100
Do you think you could...?

553
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,700
Would you mind...

554
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:46,800
...trying that again?

555
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:01,300
Bad?

556
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:04,800
Weird.

557
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:09,500
Kissing a total stranger.

558
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:12,500
Really? I do it all the time.

559
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,800
Let me try this.

560
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:29,700
Maybe if I closed my eyes.

561
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:51,300
You know, given that
I'm in a bit of a personal crisis...

562
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:55,200
...and I find myself
in a total stranger's home...

563
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:58,000
...in a town that I can't
actually remember the name of...

564
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:00,600
...and considering
that you showed up...

565
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:03,800
...and you're, like,
insanely good-looking...

566
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:07,300
...and really drunk and probably
won't remember me anyway...

567
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:11,000
...I'm thinking...

568
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:13,200
...we should have sex.

569
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,400
If you want.

570
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,600
Is that a trick question?

571
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:22,100
I'm actually serious.

572
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:26,400
And not that it matters, but I've never
said anything like that in my entire life.

573
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,200
It's just that this whole...

574
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:32,200
...knowing-I'll-never-see-you-again
thing is kind of exciting.

575
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:34,500
I mean, this is what a vacation's
supposed to be.

576
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:37,700
You're supposed to vacate life,
do the unexpected. And you are...

577
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:40,900
...definitely unexpected.

578
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:43,700
This all sounded wonderful
till I became the cabana boy.

579
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:46,700
And you're funny,
which is, like, a bonus.

580
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:48,600
Yeah? Never meet me
when I'm sober.

581
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:50,600
Deal.

582
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,900
Oh, also, I should warn you.

583
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:01,100
I'm not very good at this.

584
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:02,900
"This" being...?

585
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:06,700
- Sex.
- Okay. Now, that cannot be true.

586
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:10,200
Nevertheless, the guy that I lived with
mentioned it once or twice...

587
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:14,100
...and a girl does not forget
a comment like that. Not even me.

588
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:26,400
I mean, how bad could I be?

589
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:30,900
Sex is pretty basic, right? Am I
pretty much talking you out of this?

590
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:32,900
Strangely, not at all.

591
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:35,200
How do you feel about foreplay?

592
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:37,800
I think it's overrated.

593
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,200
Significantly overrated.

594
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:46,500
You are quickly becoming one of
the most interesting girls I've ever met.

595
00:47:56,900 --> 00:47:58,400
Look at you.

596
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:01,600
You're already better than you think.

597
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:18,800
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

598
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:23,000
I lost my contacts
last night somehow.

599
00:48:26,700 --> 00:48:28,700
- Much better.
- Yeah.

600
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:30,700
Can I help you with that?

601
00:48:31,100 --> 00:48:33,500
I should know how to do this.

602
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:41,400
You're supposed to
plug them in over here. Right.

603
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:52,500
- So, Amanda, I just really...
- Yeah. You know...

604
00:48:52,700 --> 00:48:56,100
...listen, you don't have to worry
about a thing here. Okay?

605
00:48:58,100 --> 00:48:59,000
Okay.

606
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:03,200
I mean, it was great
meeting you and everything.

607
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:09,400
Definitely. Also, for the record,
your ex-boyfriend is, in my opinion...

608
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:12,100
...extremely mistaken about you.

609
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:13,900
Well, yeah, you were drunk.

610
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:16,900
- Not that drunk.
- Yeah.

611
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:19,400
Oh, that's mine.

612
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:22,700
Sophie. I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to look.

613
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:25,100
I'll call her back.

614
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:32,300
Coffee cups.

615
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:37,400
- Here.
- Thank you.

616
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:39,600
You don't want one?

617
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:42,500
I should probably be going.

618
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:48,900
Oh, yeah. You know, I gotta get going
in a few minutes myself.

619
00:49:49,100 --> 00:49:51,700
So listen.

620
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:54,500
I know you're leaving
and absolutely not interested...

621
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:57,600
...in getting involved,
but just so you know...

622
00:49:57,800 --> 00:50:00,900
...things in my life
are a little bit complicated...

623
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:03,400
...and even if you were staying,
I can promise you...

624
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:06,200
...you wouldn't...
- You really don't have to do this.

625
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:09,900
Look, I'm sort of a mess
in this area myself.

626
00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:14,000
And anyway, I mean,
honestly, we hardly know each other.

627
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:16,500
Well, I wouldn't exactly say that...

628
00:50:16,700 --> 00:50:20,900
...but I just want to assure you,
you're better off. I'm...

629
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:22,600
- I'm...
- Okay.

630
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:27,000
No need to go on. Right.

631
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:31,200
Well, I just want to be sure
you are okay because somehow...

632
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:36,400
...I find I tend to hurt women
simply by being myself, so...

633
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:39,600
I'm not going
to fall in love with you, I promise.

634
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:42,800
Okay. Nicely put. Thank you.

635
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:47,400
No, it's just that I know myself.
I'm not sure I even fall in love.

636
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:49,700
Not like the way other people do.

637
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:52,200
How's that for something to admit?

638
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:56,500
Well, like I said,
Most Interesting Girl Award.

639
00:50:57,900 --> 00:51:00,700
I'm gonna try to see that
as a compliment.

640
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:04,000
You should. Absolutely.

641
00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:09,100
Right.

642
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:13,300
Okay, then. Well...

643
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:16,600
Utter honesty. Very refreshing.

644
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:20,300
Well, you probably
won't be hearing from me...

645
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:23,100
...because even if you wanted to,
and you clearly don't...

646
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:26,300
...I have the classic
male problem of no follow-through.

647
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:29,500
Absolutely never remember
to call after a date.

648
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:36,200
But since this wasn't a date
I guess I'm off the hook.

649
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:38,500
Exactly.

650
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:44,000
But what if I wanted to call you?

651
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:50,400
Right. Sorry. Apparently not
the right thing to say at all.

652
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:54,200
Well, if your flight's canceled
or for some reason...

653
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:57,400
...you change your mind, I'm having
dinner with some friends...

654
00:51:57,600 --> 00:51:58,700
...at the pub tonight.

655
00:52:01,300 --> 00:52:02,700
And...

656
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:08,400
...if not, then, well...

657
00:52:10,300 --> 00:52:11,800
...you're lovely.

658
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:18,500
So are you.

659
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:32,500
Attention passengers,
this is the final boarding call...

660
00:52:32,700 --> 00:52:35,800
...for British Airways flight 42.

661
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:44,600
Amanda wasn't looking for love...

662
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:49,600
...but that doesn't mean
it didn't find her.

663
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:51,300
Well, ma'am, you're good to go.

664
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,200
Thank you.

665
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:23,900
Thank you, Amanda.

666
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:46,700
Hello?

667
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:48,000
Where am I finding you?

668
00:53:50,900 --> 00:53:52,000
Jasper.

669
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:54,600
Is it okay that I'm calling you?

670
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,900
I suppose so.

671
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:00,400
How are you?

672
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:03,100
Could we start.
With a less complicated question?

673
00:54:04,900 --> 00:54:06,100
What's wrong?

674
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:10,600
I'm having some real problems
with a section of my book.

675
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:13,000
I can use some Iris.

676
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:16,200
Would it be awful
if I sent you some pages?

677
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:19,100
Just tell me if it is.
I don't wanna mess you up. I'll...

678
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:22,300
I know that you're the only one
who can really help me.

679
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:25,600
No. Well... I mean...

680
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:29,000
...if you need me.

681
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:31,800
Well, you know
you are my little survival kit.

682
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:37,900
So, Simpkey, have you put on
that little red bikini yet?

683
00:54:38,100 --> 00:54:40,900
You know,
the one that unties at the back?

684
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:43,600
How do you remember
my little red bikini?

685
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:46,800
I remember everything.

686
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,700
Do you?

687
00:54:50,100 --> 00:54:53,100
You know, just the other day,
I was just thinking about that time...

688
00:54:53,300 --> 00:54:55,400
Darling, I've just arrived
at Soho House.

689
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:57,600
I'm meeting some friends for drinks.

690
00:54:57,800 --> 00:55:00,300
- Okay.
- You keep the change.

691
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:02,100
Bloody cold in here.

692
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:04,100
Okay, I'm sending you
the pages tomorrow.

693
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:08,300
Look for them, will you?
And have some fun today, okay?

694
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:11,100
Okay.

695
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:31,000
Graham?

696
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:04,300
Oh, no, is he lost?

697
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:19,500
Excuse me.

698
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:24,200
Hello. Can I offer you a lift home?

699
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:27,100
Why? You know where I live?

700
00:56:28,100 --> 00:56:29,300
I believe I do, yes.

701
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:32,200
Good. Then that makes one of us.

702
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:37,300
Your house is lovely.

703
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:39,700
I've lived here 47 years.

704
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:43,000
Back then, there were only
six houses on this block.

705
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:45,500
Every year,
they tear another one down...

706
00:56:45,700 --> 00:56:47,200
...not that I blame them.

707
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:49,800
They weren't that great
to begin with.

708
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:56,300
But that's how I got confused.
I didn't recognize one house.

709
00:56:57,600 --> 00:56:59,400
That would be confusing.

710
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
What part of England are you from?

711
00:57:05,100 --> 00:57:08,800
- Surrey.
- Cary Grant was from Surrey.

712
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,200
That's right, he was.

713
00:57:11,700 --> 00:57:14,800
- How did you know that?
- Oh, he told me once.

714
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:18,000
Well, I thank you very much,
young lady.

715
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:23,700
Let me help you with that.

716
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:26,000
Okay.

717
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:27,700
I... Thank you.

718
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:30,400
There you go.

719
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:33,000
Well, this was some meet-cute.

720
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:36,100
- Sorry?
- It's how two characters meet...

721
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:37,600
...in a movie.

722
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:41,100
Say a man and a woman...

723
00:57:41,300 --> 00:57:43,700
...both need something to sleep in.

724
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:48,000
And they both go
to the same men's pajama department.

725
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:51,200
- Right.
- And the man says to the salesman:

726
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:54,900
"I just need bottoms."
The woman says, "I just need a top."

727
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:59,400
They look at each other,
and that's the "meet-cute."

728
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,500
Oh, I see.

729
00:58:01,700 --> 00:58:04,500
Of course, this isn't
quite that cute, but...

730
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:09,000
So you're in the film business?

731
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:12,800
Was. Yes, yes, I was.

732
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:15,500
I was a writer.

733
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:24,600
I could be here till tomorrow.

734
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:26,500
Oh, here.

735
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:28,600
Let me.

736
00:58:34,900 --> 00:58:36,600
Thank you.

737
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:09,800
Oh, my God.

738
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:28,400
Well, goodbye, then.

739
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:32,100
I enjoyed our meet-cute.

740
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:34,400
Well, thank you.
Thank you for rescuing me.

741
00:59:34,900 --> 00:59:38,300
It's a pleasure. Absolutely.

742
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:48,200
You know, I hope you
don't find this strange...

743
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:51,800
...but I've just arrived here,
and, well, I don't really know anyone.

744
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,900
And I was thinking of going out
for dinner tonight.

745
00:59:55,100 --> 00:59:57,800
Well, if you're not busy,
would you like to join me?

746
00:59:58,600 --> 01:00:03,700
Busy? Honey,
I haven't been busy since 1978.

747
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,800
I learned everything
working in this place.

748
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,200
- Best job I ever had.
- Wait, wait, wait.

749
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:14,600
That was your first job
in Hollywood?

750
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:16,800
Louis B. Mayer's office boy?

751
01:00:17,300 --> 01:00:21,600
Actually, my first job
was as a Western Union messenger.

752
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:27,100
That's how I met Mayer. I delivered
a telegram to his office at MGM.

753
01:00:27,300 --> 01:00:30,900
When I walked in, all the girls
in the office were in a tizzy.

754
01:00:31,100 --> 01:00:33,100
Their office boy didn't show up.

755
01:00:33,900 --> 01:00:38,400
I volunteered for the job.
The next day, I was on the payroll.

756
01:00:38,700 --> 01:00:41,200
I was 17 years old.

757
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:46,300
So was Hollywood really as great
back then as I imagine?

758
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:47,700
It was better.

759
01:00:51,300 --> 01:00:53,700
You know what I've been
asking myself all night?

760
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:58,300
What? Why I'm bothering you
with all these questions?

761
01:00:58,500 --> 01:01:01,300
I'm wondering
why a beautiful girl like you...

762
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:05,400
...would go to a stranger's house
for her Christmas vacation...

763
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:09,200
...and on top of that, spend Saturday
night with an old cocker like me.

764
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,200
Well, I...

765
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:15,100
I just wanted to get away
from the people I see all the time.

766
01:01:19,300 --> 01:01:22,100
Well, not all the people.

767
01:01:23,500 --> 01:01:24,800
One person.

768
01:01:25,300 --> 01:01:30,100
I wanted to get away from one guy.

769
01:01:30,900 --> 01:01:36,500
An ex-boyfriend who just got engaged
and forgot to tell me.

770
01:01:36,700 --> 01:01:39,000
- Sorry.
- So he's a schmuck.

771
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:43,800
As a matter of fact, he is.
A huge schmuck.

772
01:01:44,300 --> 01:01:46,800
- How did you know?
- He let you go.

773
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:48,800
This is not a hard one to figure out.

774
01:01:49,100 --> 01:01:53,400
Iris, in the movies
we have leading ladies...

775
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:55,200
...and we have the best friend.

776
01:01:55,600 --> 01:01:58,200
You, I can tell, are a leading lady.

777
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:01,400
But for some reason,
you're behaving like the best friend.

778
01:02:02,900 --> 01:02:04,300
You're so right.

779
01:02:04,500 --> 01:02:08,600
You're supposed to be the leading
lady of your own life, for God's sake.

780
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:14,600
Arthur, I've been going
to a therapist for three years.

781
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:18,500
And she's never explained
anything to me that well.

782
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,800
That was brilliant.

783
01:02:22,300 --> 01:02:24,900
Brutal, but brilliant.

784
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:27,100
Thank you.

785
01:02:36,700 --> 01:02:40,300
I haven't had that much to drink in...

786
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:42,500
What am I saying?

787
01:02:42,700 --> 01:02:47,000
- I've never had that much to drink.
- Yes, I believe no one ever has.

788
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:51,500
Okay, the last thing I remember
was coming in here last night and...

789
01:02:56,200 --> 01:02:59,500
- I had nothing to do with that.
- Oh, I know, but you were here.

790
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:04,200
- I was.
- Oh, God. So I guess we...

791
01:03:04,430 --> 01:03:06,230
Did we...? I mean, did we...?

792
01:03:08,600 --> 01:03:09,900
- We didn't?
- We did not.

793
01:03:11,300 --> 01:03:13,100
Oh, thank God.

794
01:03:13,300 --> 01:03:17,800
I mean, not "thank God,"
but just thank God.

795
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,800
Because I didn't remember...

796
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:24,000
So why didn't we...?
Just remind me a little.

797
01:03:25,100 --> 01:03:26,400
Call me old-fashioned...

798
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:29,800
...but one doesn't have sex
with women who are unconscious.

799
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,400
Unconscious? Oh, God.

800
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:35,800
That must have been
really attractive.

801
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:37,800
Why did you stay?

802
01:03:38,500 --> 01:03:39,800
Because you asked me to.

803
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:42,700
I did, didn't I?

804
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:48,600
Did I beg at one point?

805
01:03:51,700 --> 01:03:55,500
From the moment I met you,
it's been an adventure.

806
01:03:55,700 --> 01:03:57,900
Oh, yes.

807
01:03:58,100 --> 01:04:02,400
And I am deeply sorry about that.
I have nothing to say for myself...

808
01:04:02,600 --> 01:04:07,000
...other than I must be
temporarily nuts right now.

809
01:04:08,200 --> 01:04:11,700
Olivia. Sorry, I didn't mean to look.

810
01:04:11,900 --> 01:04:15,000
- Again.
- I should probably take this.

811
01:04:15,800 --> 01:04:18,600
Hello. Hi.

812
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:36,200
I can't. I can't today.

813
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:42,100
Sophie, Olivia, Amanda.

814
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:44,700
Busy guy.

815
01:04:57,400 --> 01:05:00,400
- I think we should go into town.
- What do you mean?

816
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:02,300
I think you should get dressed.

817
01:05:02,500 --> 01:05:06,600
We should take a drive, get some
lunch and get to know each other.

818
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:09,400
Really? Why?

819
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:12,800
Because I'm running out of reasons
why we shouldn't.

820
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:14,500
Aren't you?

821
01:05:45,500 --> 01:05:48,100
- So you're a book editor.
- Yes, I am.

822
01:05:48,300 --> 01:05:51,400
- What kind of an editor are you?
- A very mean one.

823
01:05:51,600 --> 01:05:54,800
No. What I meant was,
do you give massive notes, or...?

824
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:56,600
The better the writer,
the less notes.

825
01:05:56,800 --> 01:05:59,800
- And what'd you study in school?
- Literature.

826
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,400
And did you always know
this was what you wanted to do?

827
01:06:02,600 --> 01:06:05,300
Okay, my palms
are starting to sweat.

828
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:07,300
I feel like I'm on a job interview.

829
01:06:07,500 --> 01:06:10,000
Do you, by any chance,
know how to be on a date?

830
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:12,700
- Sorry. I'm interrogating you.
- Yes.

831
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:16,700
I haven't been on a first date
in a long time.

832
01:06:17,700 --> 01:06:20,900
Well, since we've already had sex
and slept together twice...

833
01:06:21,100 --> 01:06:23,400
...maybe we can bend
the first-date rules.

834
01:06:23,900 --> 01:06:25,200
Why are you blushing?

835
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,600
I didn't realize I was.
I think you make me nervous.

836
01:06:29,800 --> 01:06:34,500
Okay. I'm gonna try to be myself.
It's never easy, but I'm gonna try.

837
01:06:35,800 --> 01:06:37,900
What was the question? Oh, I know.

838
01:06:38,100 --> 01:06:40,600
- Did I always want to be a book editor?
- Did you...? Right.

839
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:42,900
The answer is yes.
My family's in publishing.

840
01:06:43,100 --> 01:06:44,900
My dad's a writer
of historical fiction.

841
01:06:45,100 --> 01:06:46,500
My mum was...

842
01:06:46,700 --> 01:06:50,100
Is, to this day, a very important editor
at Random House.

843
01:06:50,300 --> 01:06:54,000
Okay. I believe my time is up.
Your turn.

844
01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:55,800
Really?

845
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:57,400
- Deep breath.
- Okay.

846
01:06:58,800 --> 01:07:00,600
- All right?
- Yeah.

847
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:02,700
Well, like I said the other night...

848
01:07:02,900 --> 01:07:05,300
...I own a company
that does movie advertising.

849
01:07:05,500 --> 01:07:07,300
I didn't realize
you own the company.

850
01:07:07,500 --> 01:07:09,100
Probably because
I didn't mention it.

851
01:07:09,300 --> 01:07:12,400
But now that I know you were raised
by such a strong working mom...

852
01:07:12,600 --> 01:07:15,000
...I can say it,
and maybe you won't be intimidated.

853
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:17,300
No, no.
I'm still a little intimidated by it.

854
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:19,800
Well, "a little"
is way ahead of the curve.

855
01:07:21,700 --> 01:07:24,200
- Yeah.
- What about your family?

856
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:27,300
Okay, I'll say it fast.

857
01:07:28,500 --> 01:07:30,600
My parents broke up when I was 15.

858
01:07:31,400 --> 01:07:35,300
I'm an only child, and I...
I didn't see it coming.

859
01:07:35,500 --> 01:07:36,900
You know, we were really close.

860
01:07:37,100 --> 01:07:40,400
We used to call ourselves
"The Three Musketeers."

861
01:07:40,900 --> 01:07:44,200
And one night after dinner,
my parents sat me down...

862
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:47,000
...and told me that
they were breaking up.

863
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:49,500
I thought they were kidding.

864
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:55,000
And then I saw a suitcase out of
the corner of my eye in the hallway.

865
01:07:55,500 --> 01:07:58,000
And my dad moved out that night.

866
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:03,500
I think I cried myself to sleep
for, like, well...

867
01:08:03,700 --> 01:08:06,300
Anyway, a long time.

868
01:08:06,600 --> 01:08:10,700
And then I realized
that I'd better toughen up.

869
01:08:10,900 --> 01:08:16,100
And, well, I got through it
and sort of haven't cried since.

870
01:08:16,600 --> 01:08:20,200
I also haven't thought of
that packed suitcase maybe ever.

871
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:23,400
And that's my tragic little story.

872
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:25,900
- Let's order.
- Wait.

873
01:08:26,100 --> 01:08:27,700
You haven't cried
since you were 15?

874
01:08:27,900 --> 01:08:31,800
I know it must mean something awful.
I know, but...

875
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:35,300
You know, I try, but... Believe me.

876
01:08:35,500 --> 01:08:38,500
But can we talk about you
some more, please?

877
01:08:38,700 --> 01:08:42,500
Okay. Yes. Absolutely. Okay.
Well, I cry all the time.

878
01:08:42,700 --> 01:08:44,800
- You do not.
- Yeah, I do.

879
01:08:45,100 --> 01:08:46,800
More than any woman
you've ever met.

880
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:48,900
You don't have to be this nice.

881
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:51,300
- It happens to be the truth.
- Really?

882
01:08:51,500 --> 01:08:55,800
A good book, a great film,
a birthday card, I weep.

883
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,300
- Shut up.
- I'm a major weeper.

884
01:08:58,500 --> 01:08:59,700
I am.

885
01:09:55,400 --> 01:09:59,100
- This was such a great afternoon.
- It was a really great afternoon.

886
01:09:59,300 --> 01:10:03,100
You know, you don't have
to walk me in. It's freezing, and...

887
01:10:03,900 --> 01:10:05,800
You can just say
you don't want me to come in.

888
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,600
No, it's not that. I just... No...

889
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:12,000
I'm just tired.
I think I'm gonna take a nap.

890
01:10:12,200 --> 01:10:14,600
- It's not that.
- Okay, I'll pretend I believe you.

891
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:19,200
Graham, I'm leaving in nine days.

892
01:10:19,400 --> 01:10:22,000
And that makes this complicated.

893
01:10:22,200 --> 01:10:25,300
And I'm not sure I can handle
complicated right now.

894
01:10:29,100 --> 01:10:30,600
Okay.

895
01:10:42,100 --> 01:10:44,900
And that doesn't make things
complicated?

896
01:10:45,500 --> 01:10:47,800
Sex makes everything complicated.

897
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:52,000
Even when you don't have it, the not
having it makes things complicated.

898
01:10:52,200 --> 01:10:55,900
Which is why it's usually better
to have it. Some say.

899
01:11:01,300 --> 01:11:03,600
Well, I'm off to work in the morning.

900
01:11:03,800 --> 01:11:07,100
I promise I won't be drunkenly
banging on your door any time soon.

901
01:11:08,200 --> 01:11:11,100
We'll see each other, okay?
We'll figure something out.

902
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:13,600
- Good.
- Good.

903
01:11:23,700 --> 01:11:24,900
Oh, it's freezing.

904
01:11:44,100 --> 01:11:46,600
- Hi.
- Hello.

905
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:49,300
- Bad timing?
- No, no. Come in.

906
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,700
- How's it going?
- Good. Yeah, everything's good.

907
01:11:52,900 --> 01:11:54,400
This FedEx was leaning
on the gate.

908
01:11:54,600 --> 01:11:57,300
From a little town
called London, England.

909
01:11:59,700 --> 01:12:04,000
Friend of mine's writing a book,
and I give him...

910
01:12:05,400 --> 01:12:08,400
...notes sometimes.

911
01:12:10,900 --> 01:12:14,600
- You have company?
- I'm having a little Hanukkah party.

912
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:17,500
Did you join a temple
since I last saw you?

913
01:12:18,300 --> 01:12:21,000
No. My neighbor knew
I didn't know anyone here.

914
01:12:21,200 --> 01:12:23,600
So he wanted to introduce me
to some of his friends.

915
01:12:23,800 --> 01:12:26,300
And somehow it turned into
a Hanukkah thing.

916
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:28,400
Do you wanna come in for a sec?

917
01:12:28,600 --> 01:12:32,300
All right. Yeah.
I could play spin the dreidel.

918
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:34,000
Smells good.

919
01:12:34,200 --> 01:12:37,500
I just have to say, this is one of
the best Hanukkahs I've ever had.

920
01:12:37,700 --> 01:12:39,000
Hear, hear.

921
01:12:39,200 --> 01:12:42,700
I've had too much of the Manischewitz.
I'm gonna have to be cut off.

922
01:12:42,900 --> 01:12:45,500
We are cutting you off.

923
01:12:45,700 --> 01:12:48,500
I take this very seriously,
and I'm telling you the truth.

924
01:12:48,700 --> 01:12:50,700
He amazes me.

925
01:12:50,900 --> 01:12:52,600
Don't listen to them. They're nuts.

926
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:56,600
Okay, so you're telling me
you were not a ladies' man?

927
01:12:56,800 --> 01:12:59,300
Never. I married very young.

928
01:12:59,500 --> 01:13:01,700
Yes, only because
he had the greatest girl in town.

929
01:13:01,900 --> 01:13:03,800
He had to take her off the market.

930
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:07,500
- That's the truth.
- Everyone loved Marion.

931
01:13:07,700 --> 01:13:09,300
She had the greatest laugh.

932
01:13:09,900 --> 01:13:12,400
What did he say?
She had the greatest ass?

933
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:15,200
Greatest laugh.

934
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:18,500
Although her ass
wasn't so bad, either.

935
01:13:19,900 --> 01:13:23,700
She had real gumption.
She was the girl I always wrote.

936
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:29,100
What about you, Miles?
You're a man about town, I presume.

937
01:13:29,300 --> 01:13:33,900
No, gents, sadly I am not. I'm just
a one-woman-at-a-time kind of guy.

938
01:13:35,300 --> 01:13:39,700
Actually, I've been dating a beautiful
actress for about five months.

939
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:43,700
I do not know what she sees in me,
but I'm the luckiest guy in the world.

940
01:13:44,300 --> 01:13:46,700
Oh, she's an actress?
What's she been in?

941
01:13:46,900 --> 01:13:49,900
- Anything we would have seen?
- She hasn't done that much yet, but...

942
01:13:50,100 --> 01:13:51,600
And where is she tonight?

943
01:13:52,100 --> 01:13:54,700
Look, he's half-dead,
and he's still interested.

944
01:13:54,900 --> 01:13:59,600
Well, I mean, that made me curious.
You know, he's here. Where is she?

945
01:13:59,800 --> 01:14:04,500
She's on location in New Mexico.
She's working on a little indie film.

946
01:14:04,700 --> 01:14:08,500
Sorry she couldn't be here.
She'll be back in about 10 days.

947
01:14:08,700 --> 01:14:10,400
Her loss is our gain.

948
01:14:11,200 --> 01:14:12,900
- Thank you, Arthur.
- Fellas...

949
01:14:13,200 --> 01:14:17,100
...I think we should leave these young
folks and get back to our bedpans.

950
01:14:19,700 --> 01:14:21,800
Okay, Norman,
you are calling me for pinochle.

951
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:25,100
- I got your cell, I'll be in touch.
- Okay, pound right here.

952
01:14:29,900 --> 01:14:32,900
This was an amazing night.

953
01:14:33,100 --> 01:14:35,900
Arthur Abbott is maybe the last
of the great Hollywood writers...

954
01:14:36,100 --> 01:14:37,500
...from that generation. Thanks.

955
01:14:37,700 --> 01:14:40,700
There are, like, famous things we say
because he wrote them.

956
01:14:40,900 --> 01:14:44,000
I know. He told me
that his friends wrote Casablanca...

957
01:14:44,200 --> 01:14:48,000
...but that he added the "kid"
to "Here's looking at you, kid."

958
01:14:48,200 --> 01:14:50,800
Hello! Which totally makes the line.

959
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,800
"Here's looking at you, llsa."

960
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:55,800
Doesn't quite have that ring.

961
01:14:56,000 --> 01:15:00,400
He's so modest. He gave me this long
list of old movies he said I had to see.

962
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:02,100
None were written by him,
of course.

963
01:15:02,300 --> 01:15:05,000
I saw a couple today.
They were fantastic.

964
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:06,800
Maybe we can see one together.

965
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:10,000
- That would be great.
- All right, cool.

966
01:15:10,600 --> 01:15:11,900
Then I'll definitely call you.

967
01:15:14,100 --> 01:15:17,800
The brisket was great. And those
chocolate-covered macaroons.

968
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:21,300
Delectable. It was really fun
hanging with you.

969
01:15:22,100 --> 01:15:24,700
Okay. I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to kiss you twice...

970
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,100
...and then linger a long time
on the second kiss.

971
01:15:27,300 --> 01:15:29,700
- No problem.
- Oh, boy.

972
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:34,600
It is officially crazy weather.

973
01:15:40,200 --> 01:15:41,400
Don't blow away.

974
01:15:59,400 --> 01:16:02,100
"I'm not sure
I can handle complicated"?

975
01:16:02,300 --> 01:16:04,500
Oh, God, I can be such a jerk.

976
01:16:04,700 --> 01:16:07,900
- Amanda Woods.
- Shut up.

977
01:16:08,100 --> 01:16:11,500
She pushed every guy away,
every time.

978
01:16:11,700 --> 01:16:15,500
It's not, "Will she ever change" but,
"Does she want to?"

979
01:16:53,600 --> 01:16:57,100
- Surprise.
- Yeah, it is. Hi.

980
01:16:57,300 --> 01:17:00,800
Hi. So I was home doing nothing
and thinking of you...

981
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:04,000
...and I realized that a little
complication never hurt anyone.

982
01:17:04,200 --> 01:17:07,200
And then I thought,
maybe this isn't so complicated at all.

983
01:17:07,400 --> 01:17:09,100
And also, I wanted to apologize.

984
01:17:09,300 --> 01:17:11,900
I am sorry I didn't
invite you in this afternoon.

985
01:17:12,100 --> 01:17:14,200
I don't know what that
was about exactly...

986
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:19,100
...but whatever it was,
I thought that I should just...

987
01:17:20,900 --> 01:17:24,100
Oh, my God. You're,
you're not alone, are you?

988
01:17:25,800 --> 01:17:27,000
No, I'm not, actually.

989
01:17:28,500 --> 01:17:30,100
- I'm sorry.
- No. No, no, no. Don't be.

990
01:17:30,300 --> 01:17:32,900
I shouldn't have just...
Oh, man.

991
01:17:33,200 --> 01:17:36,100
Okay, seriously,
do not worry about this.

992
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:39,400
This is just me, like, being stupid.

993
01:17:41,200 --> 01:17:43,000
Who is it, Daddy?

994
01:17:44,900 --> 01:17:47,100
- "Daddy"?
- Yes.

995
01:17:47,300 --> 01:17:49,600
I am Daddy.

996
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:53,800
Amanda, this is my
daughter Sophie.

997
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:55,500
Soph, this is my friend Amanda.

998
01:17:55,700 --> 01:17:58,300
- Hi.
- How do you do?

999
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,600
I'm fine, thank you. How are you?

1000
01:18:05,100 --> 01:18:07,400
Very well, thank you.
Do you want to come in?

1001
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:09,000
Oh, no, I just...

1002
01:18:09,800 --> 01:18:10,800
Hi.

1003
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:12,800
Come here.

1004
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,200
Daddy, who is this?

1005
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:21,500
This is Amanda. And, Amanda,
this is my youngest. Olivia.

1006
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,300
Sophie and Olivia.

1007
01:18:29,500 --> 01:18:31,000
Dad.

1008
01:18:31,200 --> 01:18:34,300
- Dad.
- Sorry, yes. Of course, come in.

1009
01:18:34,500 --> 01:18:35,900
Come in.

1010
01:18:38,700 --> 01:18:40,200
Okay.

1011
01:18:46,700 --> 01:18:49,600
Daddy, can we still have
hot chocolate, please?

1012
01:18:49,800 --> 01:18:51,700
- Yes.
- With baby marshmallows?

1013
01:18:51,900 --> 01:18:53,500
Yes.

1014
01:19:03,800 --> 01:19:05,700
Dad, take her coat.

1015
01:19:06,400 --> 01:19:10,300
- Yes. May I, may I...?
- Oh, sure. Thanks.

1016
01:19:10,500 --> 01:19:13,400
Are you married? Tell me fast.

1017
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:15,200
- No.
- Okay.

1018
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,100
I know. I'm a tad overdressed.

1019
01:19:21,300 --> 01:19:23,300
You look like my Barbie.

1020
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:28,500
- Thanks.
- Is that for us?

1021
01:19:29,900 --> 01:19:33,500
Yes. Except for I'm sorry
about the wine.

1022
01:19:41,700 --> 01:19:44,400
I apologize for not
having mentioned this earlier.

1023
01:19:44,600 --> 01:19:47,600
You're D-I-v-O-R-C-E-D?

1024
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:53,300
W-I-D-O-W-E-R.

1025
01:19:53,900 --> 01:19:55,600
Two years ago.

1026
01:19:59,700 --> 01:20:04,100
Amanda, are you by any chance
at all into hot chocolate?

1027
01:20:06,300 --> 01:20:09,200
As a matter of fact, I'm...

1028
01:20:09,700 --> 01:20:11,500
...totally into it.

1029
01:20:11,900 --> 01:20:14,500
- Here we go, Olivia. Olivia...
- Thank you.

1030
01:20:14,700 --> 01:20:15,900
...blow on it. It's hot.

1031
01:20:18,100 --> 01:20:19,800
You too, Soph.

1032
01:20:20,200 --> 01:20:21,700
She has more marshmallows
than me.

1033
01:20:21,900 --> 01:20:23,800
No, she doesn't.
You each have five.

1034
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:26,400
- You have five too.
- Thank you.

1035
01:20:26,700 --> 01:20:29,800
One, two, three, four, five.

1036
01:20:35,100 --> 01:20:37,200
What? Do I have something
on my lip?

1037
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:39,600
Just look! There.

1038
01:20:41,900 --> 01:20:43,800
- Oh, hello.
- Hello.

1039
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:47,000
- Hello.
- Going up! Blow on mine.

1040
01:20:49,100 --> 01:20:51,000
Thank you.

1041
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:52,400
Excellent timing.

1042
01:20:53,100 --> 01:20:56,100
Dad, do Mr. Napkin Head.

1043
01:20:56,300 --> 01:20:58,800
- No. No, no, no. No Mr. Napkin Head.
- Please? Do it!

1044
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:02,500
- Do it. Do it. Please.
- Do it, please. Beg you, please?

1045
01:21:02,700 --> 01:21:05,400
Please? Okay, I'll do it quickly.

1046
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:08,300
- Oh, well, thank you for that.
- You're welcome. Now do it.

1047
01:21:08,500 --> 01:21:10,000
All right.

1048
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:13,900
Amanda, can I borrow
your napkin, please?

1049
01:21:14,100 --> 01:21:15,400
Yes.

1050
01:21:15,800 --> 01:21:17,200
Your glasses.

1051
01:21:17,400 --> 01:21:18,900
Pass me those when I need them.

1052
01:21:19,100 --> 01:21:21,300
Amanda, you're gonna love this.

1053
01:21:21,500 --> 01:21:25,800
It's so funny. I mean, you'll fall
off your chair, it's so funny.

1054
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:28,500
Hello.

1055
01:21:30,700 --> 01:21:33,600
Hello, my name is Mr. Napkin Head.

1056
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:37,000
- Hello, children.
- Who's this? She's a stranger?

1057
01:21:37,200 --> 01:21:39,600
- Amanda.
- And why has she got a funny accent?

1058
01:21:39,800 --> 01:21:42,300
- Amanda.
- Yeah, but where is she from?

1059
01:21:43,800 --> 01:21:46,900
Now smoke!

1060
01:21:47,700 --> 01:21:49,400
Go on.

1061
01:21:53,500 --> 01:21:55,400
Smoking's really bad for you.

1062
01:21:57,800 --> 01:21:59,800
Amanda, guess what.

1063
01:22:00,100 --> 01:22:02,900
We have a tent in our playroom.
Do you want to see it?

1064
01:22:03,100 --> 01:22:05,100
No, no, no. Amanda...

1065
01:22:05,300 --> 01:22:08,500
...will not crawl into your tent.

1066
01:22:09,100 --> 01:22:12,100
You don't like tents?

1067
01:22:21,400 --> 01:22:23,700
Okay, this is seriously cool.

1068
01:22:23,900 --> 01:22:25,900
Come inside.

1069
01:22:29,600 --> 01:22:30,900
- Lie down.
- Okay.

1070
01:22:31,100 --> 01:22:34,000
Here, Amanda.
You can use my pillow.

1071
01:22:34,300 --> 01:22:35,700
- Thank you.
- Lie down!

1072
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:37,700
Can you please
stop being so bossy?

1073
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:41,400
- Lie down, please, next to me.
- Okay.

1074
01:22:46,500 --> 01:22:48,800
Very nice.

1075
01:22:49,400 --> 01:22:51,600
Excuse me.

1076
01:22:54,400 --> 01:22:57,800
This is an exceptionally great tent.

1077
01:22:58,000 --> 01:22:59,400
It's got something, hasn't it?

1078
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:02,600
- It's cozy.
- Yeah.

1079
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:05,000
Who cut out
all these beautiful stars?

1080
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:08,300
- We did.
- The Three Musketeers!

1081
01:23:19,700 --> 01:23:21,100
Amanda?

1082
01:23:21,700 --> 01:23:24,100
- Yes?
- You smell lovely.

1083
01:23:24,300 --> 01:23:25,500
Do I?

1084
01:23:25,700 --> 01:23:30,400
Yes. I love perfume,
but he won't let me wear it.

1085
01:23:30,600 --> 01:23:33,400
Because you already smell so good.

1086
01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:36,300
- So do you, by the way.
- Thanks.

1087
01:23:36,500 --> 01:23:40,200
- But I'm older, so I guess I'm allowed.
- Exactly.

1088
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:42,900
I like your eye shadow.

1089
01:23:43,100 --> 01:23:44,500
Thank you.

1090
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,500
- And your lipstick.
- Thank you.

1091
01:23:47,700 --> 01:23:50,600
- It's new.
- What's it called?

1092
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:54,400
I think it's called Berry Kiss.

1093
01:23:54,600 --> 01:23:57,200
Very Berry Kiss it is.

1094
01:23:58,600 --> 01:24:00,700
Berry Kiss.

1095
01:24:02,300 --> 01:24:04,700
Let's see? It looks good on you.

1096
01:24:04,900 --> 01:24:06,200
Amanda?

1097
01:24:07,500 --> 01:24:10,900
You know, if you wanted to sleep over,
that would be all right.

1098
01:24:11,100 --> 01:24:12,600
We could push our beds together.

1099
01:24:14,100 --> 01:24:15,700
Sorry.

1100
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:18,700
That's so sweet of you
to invite me...

1101
01:24:18,900 --> 01:24:22,300
...but maybe another time.
Would that be all right?

1102
01:24:22,900 --> 01:24:24,500
Yes.

1103
01:24:27,100 --> 01:24:28,900
Good girl.

1104
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:35,500
We never have grownups here
that are girls.

1105
01:24:36,100 --> 01:24:37,200
I know.

1106
01:24:37,700 --> 01:24:39,600
I really like it.

1107
01:24:39,800 --> 01:24:42,400
Me too.

1108
01:25:01,400 --> 01:25:04,700
I can't imagine anyone being
a bigger hit with my children.

1109
01:25:06,600 --> 01:25:07,900
They're really great, Graham.

1110
01:25:08,700 --> 01:25:11,600
Sophie's unfortunately taken
on the role as my protector.

1111
01:25:11,800 --> 01:25:15,100
She's brilliant, but I hate it
when she worries about me.

1112
01:25:15,300 --> 01:25:16,900
And Olivia's...

1113
01:25:17,100 --> 01:25:19,300
...gonna be a real ball-buster.

1114
01:25:19,500 --> 01:25:22,500
Which, I must admit,
I kind of love about her.

1115
01:25:23,500 --> 01:25:26,100
I'm trying to figure out
why you didn't tell me about them.

1116
01:25:28,200 --> 01:25:30,700
Because I just don't usually
tell women about them.

1117
01:25:30,900 --> 01:25:32,900
But it's just a little confusing...

1118
01:25:33,100 --> 01:25:35,700
...because you're the one
who wanted to go out to lunch...

1119
01:25:35,900 --> 01:25:37,400
...to get to know one another.

1120
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:40,600
When you put it that way,
it sounds awful.

1121
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:45,500
I have no defense. Except that until
I get to know someone really well...

1122
01:25:45,700 --> 01:25:48,000
...it's easier for me to
be a normal, single guy.

1123
01:25:48,200 --> 01:25:52,200
Because it's way too complicated
to be who I really am.

1124
01:25:52,700 --> 01:25:54,600
I'm a full-time dad.

1125
01:25:54,800 --> 01:25:58,000
I'm a working parent.
I'm a mother and a father.

1126
01:25:58,300 --> 01:26:02,400
I'm a guy who reads parenting books
and cookbooks before I go to sleep.

1127
01:26:02,600 --> 01:26:06,100
I spend my weekends buying tutus.
I'm learning to sew.

1128
01:26:06,300 --> 01:26:07,900
I'm Mr. Napkin Head!

1129
01:26:08,100 --> 01:26:12,000
I'm on some kind of
constant overload and it helps...

1130
01:26:12,900 --> 01:26:16,900
...to compartmentalize my life.
Just till I figure this out.

1131
01:26:17,500 --> 01:26:20,200
This past weekend, the children
were with their grandparents.

1132
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:23,500
And when they're gone,
I get to be somebody...

1133
01:26:23,700 --> 01:26:26,900
...who doesn't have hot chocolate
spilled on his jeans.

1134
01:26:27,800 --> 01:26:31,500
I have no idea how to date
and be this.

1135
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
And I suppose there's...

1136
01:26:35,300 --> 01:26:37,700
...the possibility I'm afraid
of what another person...

1137
01:26:37,900 --> 01:26:40,100
...might do to who we are...

1138
01:26:40,300 --> 01:26:42,700
...and how we get from
one day to the next.

1139
01:26:47,400 --> 01:26:48,700
Yeah.

1140
01:26:49,900 --> 01:26:53,100
I guess since I am
leaving in a week, I...

1141
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,400
I sort of get you not telling me.

1142
01:26:57,300 --> 01:27:00,400
- Sort of.
- I thought it would be hard...

1143
01:27:00,600 --> 01:27:03,500
...to introduce them to someone
I may never see again.

1144
01:27:09,100 --> 01:27:10,500
Right.

1145
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:15,400
Because I'm just someone you had
sex with once and slept with twice.

1146
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:20,100
I thought I was just someone you had
sex with once and slept with twice.

1147
01:27:20,300 --> 01:27:22,000
Oh, man.

1148
01:27:23,700 --> 01:27:26,300
I think we just went
way past complicated.

1149
01:27:26,500 --> 01:27:30,800
Right. I'm a book editor
from London. You're a...

1150
01:27:31,600 --> 01:27:33,200
...beautiful...

1151
01:27:33,400 --> 01:27:36,500
...movie trailer-maker from L.A.

1152
01:27:37,400 --> 01:27:39,600
We're worlds apart.

1153
01:27:40,400 --> 01:27:42,500
I have a cow in the back yard.

1154
01:27:43,200 --> 01:27:44,900
- You have a cow?
- Yeah.

1155
01:27:45,100 --> 01:27:47,800
I sew and I have a cow.

1156
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,500
How's that for hard to relate to?

1157
01:27:54,500 --> 01:27:56,400
Pretty up there.

1158
01:27:57,900 --> 01:27:59,600
Exactly.

1159
01:28:13,300 --> 01:28:14,800
- Morning, Jesus.
- Good morning.

1160
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:16,900
- Santa Anas?
- Oh, yeah, long time now.

1161
01:28:17,100 --> 01:28:19,500
- Hi, Marta.
- Hi, Iris.

1162
01:28:22,700 --> 01:28:24,100
Hi there.

1163
01:28:25,100 --> 01:28:26,800
Hello!

1164
01:28:27,800 --> 01:28:29,200
Good morning.

1165
01:28:29,400 --> 01:28:31,100
I counted.

1166
01:28:31,300 --> 01:28:33,500
Nine movies are opening today.

1167
01:28:33,700 --> 01:28:36,600
I remember when nine movies
would open in a month.

1168
01:28:36,800 --> 01:28:42,300
Now a picture has to make a killing
the first weekend or they're dead.

1169
01:28:42,600 --> 01:28:45,400
This is supposed to be conducive
to great work?

1170
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:48,900
Arthur, have you always
been this feisty?

1171
01:28:49,100 --> 01:28:52,200
Well, I may have slowed down
a little, but yes.

1172
01:28:52,400 --> 01:28:54,700
You've gotta fight the fight, kid.

1173
01:28:55,700 --> 01:28:56,800
Okay, your mail.

1174
01:28:57,400 --> 01:29:00,500
Gas company, phone bill.

1175
01:29:00,700 --> 01:29:04,300
And a letter from the
Writers Guild of America, West.

1176
01:29:07,300 --> 01:29:09,300
Are you watching the movies
I recommended?

1177
01:29:09,500 --> 01:29:13,400
Yes! Love them.
Irene Dunne is fantastic.

1178
01:29:13,600 --> 01:29:16,900
- Gumption.
- Oh, my God, tons of it.

1179
01:29:17,500 --> 01:29:20,500
Arthur, don't you want to open that
letter you just threw in the bin?

1180
01:29:20,800 --> 01:29:23,200
No. They keep writing me
about the same thing.

1181
01:29:23,500 --> 01:29:25,000
But it might be important.

1182
01:29:25,200 --> 01:29:30,000
It's not. They want to arrange
some kind of tribute to me.

1183
01:29:30,200 --> 01:29:32,000
A night with me.

1184
01:29:32,200 --> 01:29:33,800
I don't know. It sounds God-awful.

1185
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,900
What are you talking about?
That sounds brilliant!

1186
01:29:37,100 --> 01:29:42,900
Would you like to walk out on a stage,
on a walker, looking 100 years old...

1187
01:29:43,100 --> 01:29:46,000
...and see 11 schnooks
who showed up just to see you?

1188
01:29:46,200 --> 01:29:48,000
They can forget it.

1189
01:29:48,200 --> 01:29:50,100
I ain't falling for this.

1190
01:29:50,300 --> 01:29:53,700
So now, what's up?

1191
01:29:54,100 --> 01:29:55,600
May I?

1192
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:02,900
"An Evening With Arthur Abbott."

1193
01:30:04,700 --> 01:30:08,200
"Dear Mr. Abbott... several
attempts to contact you regarding..."

1194
01:30:08,400 --> 01:30:11,400
"We have not yet received
your response.

1195
01:30:12,400 --> 01:30:14,900
This special night
will be a tribute to your...

1196
01:30:15,100 --> 01:30:19,200
...lifetime screenwriting achievement
and contribution to the profession.

1197
01:30:19,400 --> 01:30:22,400
Congratulations on this
much-deserved honor."

1198
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:24,800
Arthur, this is a big deal.

1199
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:27,200
You know, and they want
to do this soon.

1200
01:30:28,100 --> 01:30:31,300
Listen, I reckon
that with a little bit of exercise...

1201
01:30:31,500 --> 01:30:33,200
...you could walk out on your own.

1202
01:30:33,400 --> 01:30:36,000
And, you know,
maybe I could go with you.

1203
01:30:36,200 --> 01:30:39,300
As, like, your date or something.

1204
01:30:39,500 --> 01:30:43,100
I would take you proudly,
my darling, but I'm not going.

1205
01:30:43,900 --> 01:30:48,600
Anyway, how would you propose
to get me in shape? Seriously.

1206
01:30:49,800 --> 01:30:51,100
Easy.

1207
01:30:52,200 --> 01:30:54,400
You're doing really well.

1208
01:30:54,600 --> 01:30:58,300
Nearly there. Nearly there.
Nearly there.

1209
01:30:58,500 --> 01:31:01,900
Bravo! Here we go,
back the other way.

1210
01:31:07,900 --> 01:31:09,900
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

1211
01:31:10,100 --> 01:31:12,600
- You sure?
- Yeah, I just slipped.

1212
01:31:33,400 --> 01:31:35,600
- Hello?
- So are you ever coming home?

1213
01:31:35,800 --> 01:31:38,000
- Oh, my God. Hi.
- How's it going?

1214
01:31:38,200 --> 01:31:39,700
Great. I met a really nice guy.

1215
01:31:39,900 --> 01:31:42,100
See? And you said you'd never.
What's he like?

1216
01:31:42,300 --> 01:31:44,600
He's really cute. I feel great
when I'm with him...

1217
01:31:44,800 --> 01:31:48,800
...which is an entirely new experience.
And he's about 90 years old.

1218
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:50,900
- Come on.
- He's my next-door neighbor.

1219
01:31:51,100 --> 01:31:54,300
Or Amanda's next-door neighbor.
By the way, you should go meet her.

1220
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:58,700
- Yeah. I have, actually.
- Oh, bugger. Call waiting.

1221
01:31:58,900 --> 01:32:01,800
Can you hold for a sec? Hold on.
I really wanna talk to you.

1222
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:03,800
- Sure.
- Hello.

1223
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:07,200
- Iris, hi, it's Amanda.
- How are you? How's it going?

1224
01:32:07,400 --> 01:32:10,400
- Everything's great. How are you?
- Oh, I'm loving it.

1225
01:32:10,700 --> 01:32:13,100
Can you hold for a sec?
My brother's on the other line.

1226
01:32:13,300 --> 01:32:15,500
- Graham?
- Yes. He said you met.

1227
01:32:15,700 --> 01:32:19,100
- Yes, we did meet. How is he?
- Fine, I think.

1228
01:32:19,300 --> 01:32:21,000
- Can you just hold on for a sec?
- Sure.

1229
01:32:21,200 --> 01:32:24,800
- Okay. Hi, sorry. That was Amanda.
- How'd she sound?

1230
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:27,500
- How is she doing?
- She just asked me how you are.

1231
01:32:27,700 --> 01:32:29,700
- And what did you say?
- I asked her to hold.

1232
01:32:29,900 --> 01:32:32,900
- Can I call you back?
- I can hold while you speak to her.

1233
01:32:33,100 --> 01:32:35,800
- Really?
- Find out how she is.

1234
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,600
Okay. My brother wants to know
how you are.

1235
01:32:38,900 --> 01:32:42,900
Can you tell him I'm good and that
I'm just walking Charlie in the village.

1236
01:32:43,100 --> 01:32:45,900
- What's he been up to? Did he say?
- I'm not sure.

1237
01:32:46,100 --> 01:32:48,900
- Do you want me to ask him?
- Sure.

1238
01:32:49,500 --> 01:32:52,300
Okay. Hold, please.

1239
01:32:53,100 --> 01:32:56,700
I can't believe that you have had sex
with the woman staying in my house!

1240
01:32:57,600 --> 01:32:59,100
He told you that?

1241
01:32:59,300 --> 01:33:01,200
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!

1242
01:33:01,400 --> 01:33:05,000
Oh, my God. I thought I was talking
to Graham! Can you just hold, please?

1243
01:33:05,200 --> 01:33:07,300
I'm terribly sorry.

1244
01:33:08,300 --> 01:33:09,900
I can't believe you
had sex with Amanda!

1245
01:33:10,100 --> 01:33:13,000
The one thing she asked me was,
"Are there any men in your town?"

1246
01:33:13,200 --> 01:33:15,000
I assured her that there were not.

1247
01:33:15,200 --> 01:33:17,700
Then you meet her and immediately
get into her knickers!

1248
01:33:18,700 --> 01:33:20,300
Still me.

1249
01:33:21,100 --> 01:33:23,200
Bollocks! I must have lost him.

1250
01:33:23,400 --> 01:33:26,800
Amanda, I am so sorry.

1251
01:33:27,800 --> 01:33:30,000
Can I call you back?

1252
01:33:30,200 --> 01:33:33,300
- Sure.
- Okay, bye.

1253
01:33:34,200 --> 01:33:36,200
Yes, hello.

1254
01:33:37,400 --> 01:33:39,200
It's Miles. Am I in trouble?

1255
01:33:39,800 --> 01:33:42,300
Oh, Miles. Hi.

1256
01:33:42,500 --> 01:33:44,100
What are you up to
this Christmas Eve?

1257
01:33:44,300 --> 01:33:46,300
Not much. But in a little bit...

1258
01:33:46,500 --> 01:33:49,800
...I'm gonna go to the video shop
and get the next movie on Arthur's list.

1259
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:51,700
Do you want some company?

1260
01:33:53,200 --> 01:33:54,600
Love some.

1261
01:33:55,800 --> 01:33:59,800
Hey, I got you the best drink
in town, but I didn't know...

1262
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,800
...if you liked a little dollop
of whipped cream or a big one...

1263
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,800
...so I got both and you can have
each one... Hello, big dollop!

1264
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,000
- Say, you look great, by the way.
- Thanks.

1265
01:34:08,200 --> 01:34:10,300
- Really great.
- Thanks, I'm feeling good.

1266
01:34:10,500 --> 01:34:13,100
I've been working out with Arthur.

1267
01:34:13,300 --> 01:34:14,500
- What?
- No.

1268
01:34:14,700 --> 01:34:18,700
I'm sure it's an awesome workout.
I'm sorry. I'm trying not to picture it.

1269
01:34:18,900 --> 01:34:21,600
Okay, well, the workout's
not that great, but the conver...

1270
01:34:21,800 --> 01:34:23,100
Stop laughing!

1271
01:34:23,300 --> 01:34:27,500
- The conversation is truly fantastic.
- No, that I totally believe.

1272
01:34:27,700 --> 01:34:31,300
Now let me ask you.
Have you seen this?

1273
01:34:31,500 --> 01:34:33,800
Chariots of Fire. Loved it.

1274
01:34:39,800 --> 01:34:42,100
Such a great score by vangelis.

1275
01:34:42,300 --> 01:34:45,600
He took electronic scores to a new
level. It was groundbreaking.

1276
01:34:45,800 --> 01:34:48,500
I'm gonna test you on this later.
Okay. Driving Miss Daisy.

1277
01:34:48,800 --> 01:34:52,100
Hans. Very unexpected.
Do you remember how great it was?

1278
01:34:58,300 --> 01:35:00,100
Sassy! Love it.

1279
01:35:00,300 --> 01:35:01,600
- Is this a bad game?
- No!

1280
01:35:01,800 --> 01:35:03,300
- Okay.
- Keep going.

1281
01:35:03,500 --> 01:35:05,800
Sometimes I get self-conscious
about my...

1282
01:35:08,900 --> 01:35:09,900
And:

1283
01:35:12,300 --> 01:35:18,200
Are you embarrassed
By this game I've start. Ed to play?

1284
01:35:18,400 --> 01:35:21,700
Okay. It's not a library.
I can go loud.

1285
01:35:24,600 --> 01:35:26,500
Two notes and you've got a villain.

1286
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,200
I don't know what to say about it.
Totally brill.

1287
01:35:34,500 --> 01:35:38,000
I bet you didn't know that was all
written for the movie. It was a score.

1288
01:35:38,200 --> 01:35:40,000
- I did know that one.
- Can't go anywhere.

1289
01:35:40,200 --> 01:35:43,500
Oh, my God. Okay, this one?
You have to check this out some time.

1290
01:35:43,700 --> 01:35:45,900
The Mission.
The score is genius.

1291
01:35:46,100 --> 01:35:49,400
It just comes from
a totally different place. It's like...

1292
01:35:49,600 --> 01:35:53,300
I can't even... Just promise me
you'll rent it and listen to it.

1293
01:35:53,500 --> 01:35:55,100
- Renting.
- Thank you.

1294
01:35:55,400 --> 01:35:56,300
It changed my world.

1295
01:36:04,500 --> 01:36:06,000
What?

1296
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:12,600
Maggie!

1297
01:36:27,700 --> 01:36:32,200
- Why do I always fall for the bad girl?
- You didn't know she was a bad girl.

1298
01:36:33,300 --> 01:36:35,500
I knew she wasn't good.

1299
01:36:35,900 --> 01:36:39,000
Do you have anything
a little bit stronger?

1300
01:36:39,900 --> 01:36:43,600
Thank you. Let me rephrase this:

1301
01:36:46,300 --> 01:36:50,100
Why am I attracted to a person
I know isn't good?

1302
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:54,900
I happen to know the answer to this.
You're hoping you're wrong.

1303
01:36:55,100 --> 01:36:57,800
She does something that tells you
she's no good, you ignore it.

1304
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:01,100
Every time she comes through and
surprises you, she wins you over...

1305
01:37:01,300 --> 01:37:04,900
...and you lose that argument
with yourself that she's not for you.

1306
01:37:05,400 --> 01:37:06,400
Exactly.

1307
01:37:07,600 --> 01:37:09,500
And on top of that,
there's the old standby:

1308
01:37:09,700 --> 01:37:12,700
"I can't believe a girl like that
would be with a guy like me."

1309
01:37:13,600 --> 01:37:15,300
You know what she said
to me tonight?

1310
01:37:15,800 --> 01:37:17,800
She finished in Santa Fe
after two days...

1311
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,200
...and has been staying with
whatever-his-name-was.

1312
01:37:20,400 --> 01:37:22,300
Which means she's been
right here in town.

1313
01:37:22,800 --> 01:37:25,500
When I spoke to her this morning
on her cell and she said:

1314
01:37:25,700 --> 01:37:27,800
"I'm looking out my window
and it's snowing."

1315
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,500
She was in Santa Monica.

1316
01:37:30,800 --> 01:37:32,500
What did she do,
go to Weather. Com?

1317
01:37:32,700 --> 01:37:34,800
That must have made them
scream with laughter.

1318
01:37:35,100 --> 01:37:39,000
And in the meantime, I sent her
Christmas gift to Santa Fe yesterday.

1319
01:37:39,200 --> 01:37:42,900
I stood in line at FedEx
to make sure she got it on time.

1320
01:37:43,600 --> 01:37:45,800
Classic, right?

1321
01:37:46,700 --> 01:37:50,200
I don't wanna ruin your Christmas Eve.
You don't have to listen to this.

1322
01:37:50,400 --> 01:37:52,300
It's okay.

1323
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:54,300
I like the company.

1324
01:37:59,500 --> 01:38:00,700
So how about some food?

1325
01:38:00,900 --> 01:38:03,500
Shall I make us
a little Christmas fettuccine?

1326
01:38:03,700 --> 01:38:06,800
- Sure.
- Listen.

1327
01:38:07,300 --> 01:38:11,100
I know it's hard to believe people
when they say, "I know how you feel."

1328
01:38:12,700 --> 01:38:15,400
But I actually know how you feel.

1329
01:38:16,900 --> 01:38:18,600
You see...

1330
01:38:19,500 --> 01:38:20,900
...I was...

1331
01:38:22,100 --> 01:38:25,300
...seeing someone back in London.

1332
01:38:25,700 --> 01:38:27,900
We worked for
the same newspaper.

1333
01:38:28,100 --> 01:38:32,600
And then I found out that he was
also seeing this other girl, Sarah...

1334
01:38:32,800 --> 01:38:35,700
...from the Circulation Department
on the 19th floor.

1335
01:38:36,600 --> 01:38:40,500
It turned out that he wasn't
in love with me like I thought.

1336
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:45,500
What I'm trying to say is...

1337
01:38:45,700 --> 01:38:49,200
...I understand feeling
as small and as insignificant...

1338
01:38:49,400 --> 01:38:51,900
...as humanly possible.

1339
01:38:52,100 --> 01:38:56,800
How it can actually ache in places that
you didn't know you had inside you.

1340
01:38:58,100 --> 01:39:00,300
It doesn't matter how many
new haircuts you get...

1341
01:39:00,500 --> 01:39:02,500
...or gyms you join...

1342
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:05,900
...or how many glasses of chardonnay
you drink with girlfriends.

1343
01:39:06,100 --> 01:39:09,700
You still go to bed every night
going over every detail...

1344
01:39:09,900 --> 01:39:15,400
...and wonder what you did wrong
or how you could have misunderstood.

1345
01:39:16,700 --> 01:39:18,700
And how in the hell,
for that brief moment...

1346
01:39:18,900 --> 01:39:21,200
...you could think that you were
that happy?

1347
01:39:21,400 --> 01:39:23,400
And sometimes you can
even convince yourself...

1348
01:39:23,600 --> 01:39:26,300
...that he'll see the light
and show up at your door.

1349
01:39:29,400 --> 01:39:31,100
And after all that...

1350
01:39:31,700 --> 01:39:34,800
...however long "all that" may be...

1351
01:39:35,800 --> 01:39:38,100
...you'll go somewhere new.

1352
01:39:38,400 --> 01:39:42,000
And you'll meet people who make you
feel worthwhile again.

1353
01:39:43,200 --> 01:39:47,400
And little pieces of your soul
will finally come back.

1354
01:39:47,900 --> 01:39:49,200
And all that fuzzy stuff...

1355
01:39:51,600 --> 01:39:56,000
...those years of your life
that you wasted...

1356
01:39:58,700 --> 01:40:01,500
...that will eventually begin to fade.

1357
01:40:03,800 --> 01:40:04,800
Well, fuck.

1358
01:40:05,900 --> 01:40:07,700
You need this more than I do.

1359
01:40:10,600 --> 01:40:13,600
That's what you're doing here?
You're getting over somebody?

1360
01:40:13,800 --> 01:40:15,300
Yeah.

1361
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:17,400
This is me in good shape.

1362
01:40:18,100 --> 01:40:20,300
Is this the guy who sent you pages
from his novel?

1363
01:40:20,900 --> 01:40:22,500
Yeah.

1364
01:40:23,400 --> 01:40:24,400
He needs me.

1365
01:40:25,200 --> 01:40:27,100
So he stays in touch?

1366
01:40:27,300 --> 01:40:29,600
All the time.

1367
01:40:29,800 --> 01:40:33,200
That makes it impossible to forget,
which is great for him, sucks for you.

1368
01:40:34,400 --> 01:40:36,700
You see how great your life is
compared to mine?

1369
01:40:38,100 --> 01:40:41,400
Okay, let's go.
I'm making you some fettuccine.

1370
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:45,100
It is Christmas Eve, and we
are going to sit out on that patio...

1371
01:40:45,300 --> 01:40:47,900
...gonna make ourselves a little fire,
pop some bubbly...

1372
01:40:48,100 --> 01:40:51,500
...and we are gonna celebrate
being young and being alive.

1373
01:40:53,400 --> 01:40:55,200
You with me, Simpkins?

1374
01:40:56,600 --> 01:40:58,300
Miles.

1375
01:41:00,300 --> 01:41:02,700
You really are
an incredibly decent man.

1376
01:41:03,100 --> 01:41:04,900
I know.

1377
01:41:05,100 --> 01:41:07,900
That's always been my problem.

1378
01:42:23,200 --> 01:42:25,100
Hi.

1379
01:42:40,800 --> 01:42:43,300
Okay, here it is.

1380
01:42:43,500 --> 01:42:46,100
Arthur's theme.
I think this is really good.

1381
01:42:46,300 --> 01:42:47,400
- I'm serious.
- No, I know.

1382
01:42:47,600 --> 01:42:50,200
I'm making him a CD of this tune.
Every time he hears it...

1383
01:42:50,400 --> 01:42:53,100
...it should give him the confidence
to walk right out there.

1384
01:42:53,300 --> 01:42:54,400
- Okay?
- Yep.

1385
01:42:54,600 --> 01:42:56,300
Here we go.

1386
01:42:59,900 --> 01:43:01,800
Did I steal this?

1387
01:43:02,300 --> 01:43:05,400
- John Williams.
- I didn't write it, that's why.

1388
01:43:05,600 --> 01:43:07,000
- Okay, this is it for real.
- Okay.

1389
01:43:07,200 --> 01:43:08,800
- Here we go.
- Yep.

1390
01:43:09,900 --> 01:43:12,400
A little Arthur and the knights.

1391
01:43:16,900 --> 01:43:18,900
Right? It's cheeky.

1392
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:22,400
It sounds like him.

1393
01:43:26,600 --> 01:43:28,400
I also wrote one
that sounds like you.

1394
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:32,000
You did?

1395
01:43:34,300 --> 01:43:37,400
Iris, if you were a melody.

1396
01:43:43,500 --> 01:43:46,000
I used only the good notes.

1397
01:43:58,800 --> 01:44:02,500
Iris lives next door

1398
01:44:02,700 --> 01:44:08,000
To Art. Hur
He's a doodle-ee-doo

1399
01:44:08,200 --> 01:44:10,700
- And also a doodle-ee-doo
- Scroodle-ee-doo

1400
01:44:10,900 --> 01:44:13,400
- A scroodle-ee-doo? I didn't know that.
- Yeah.

1401
01:44:13,600 --> 01:44:15,200
- And froodle-ee-doo
- And froodle-ee-doo

1402
01:44:15,500 --> 01:44:17,100
We both said "froodle-ee."

1403
01:44:17,400 --> 01:44:18,800
I'm impressed.

1404
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:20,200
You are a prodigy.

1405
01:44:20,400 --> 01:44:21,700
A "doodle" prodigy.

1406
01:44:21,900 --> 01:44:23,400
Swoodle-ee-doo

1407
01:44:37,400 --> 01:44:40,600
So you're totally great.

1408
01:44:43,300 --> 01:44:44,900
Yeah.

1409
01:44:45,100 --> 01:44:46,400
This is a bitch.

1410
01:44:49,100 --> 01:44:52,500
Well, you must come to London
all the time for work, right?

1411
01:44:52,700 --> 01:44:54,400
London?

1412
01:44:54,800 --> 01:44:56,300
Never.

1413
01:44:57,300 --> 01:44:58,900
New York?

1414
01:44:59,800 --> 01:45:02,600
Not really, but that's easier.
Do you go there often?

1415
01:45:03,200 --> 01:45:04,900
Rarely.

1416
01:45:05,300 --> 01:45:07,200
Long-distance relationships
can work.

1417
01:45:07,800 --> 01:45:09,500
Really? I can't make one work...

1418
01:45:09,700 --> 01:45:11,700
...when I live in the same house
with someone.

1419
01:45:11,900 --> 01:45:14,500
So this could be
a good solution for you.

1420
01:45:17,300 --> 01:45:19,300
Oh, man.

1421
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:23,600
Okay.

1422
01:45:24,400 --> 01:45:25,900
Let's say we just make this happen.

1423
01:45:26,100 --> 01:45:28,500
We commit to flying back and forth
as much as we can.

1424
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:30,900
Yes! It's doable, definitely.

1425
01:45:31,100 --> 01:45:34,500
And then let's say
in six months we hit a wall.

1426
01:45:34,700 --> 01:45:37,100
Like, I can't constantly
be away from work...

1427
01:45:37,300 --> 01:45:39,800
...or the girls can't deal with you
leaving so often.

1428
01:45:40,200 --> 01:45:43,100
And we start to feel the tension.
We know this isn't gonna work...

1429
01:45:43,300 --> 01:45:46,500
...so we start fighting because
we don't know what else to do.

1430
01:45:46,700 --> 01:45:48,800
And then, after a long, tearful...

1431
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:50,700
At your end... phone call...

1432
01:45:50,900 --> 01:45:53,000
...we just... We say goodbye.
- Thank you.

1433
01:45:53,200 --> 01:45:56,400
That'll be it, for real. It's not like
we'll ever bump into each other.

1434
01:45:56,700 --> 01:45:59,500
And then what's left?
Two miserable people...

1435
01:45:59,700 --> 01:46:02,200
...feeling totally mashed up
and hurt.

1436
01:46:09,700 --> 01:46:11,400
Or...

1437
01:46:11,900 --> 01:46:13,700
Thank you.

1438
01:46:17,100 --> 01:46:19,000
Or maybe we should just...

1439
01:46:19,200 --> 01:46:23,000
...realize that what we've had these
past few weeks has been perfect.

1440
01:46:23,800 --> 01:46:25,900
And maybe it won't
get any better than this.

1441
01:46:26,100 --> 01:46:28,200
Maybe we're trying to figure
this thing out...

1442
01:46:28,400 --> 01:46:30,400
...because it makes us
feel good to feel this.

1443
01:46:30,600 --> 01:46:32,600
Maybe the fact
that I'm leaving in 8 hours...

1444
01:46:32,800 --> 01:46:36,700
...makes this far more exciting
than it might actually be.

1445
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:39,400
Maybe.

1446
01:46:39,600 --> 01:46:42,700
You are, seriously,
the most depressing girl I've ever met.

1447
01:46:43,900 --> 01:46:45,700
I know.

1448
01:46:48,100 --> 01:46:50,100
I have another scenario for you.

1449
01:46:50,300 --> 01:46:52,800
- Good.
- I'm in love with you.

1450
01:46:58,600 --> 01:47:01,100
I apologize for the blunt delivery.

1451
01:47:01,800 --> 01:47:04,700
But as problematical as this...

1452
01:47:04,900 --> 01:47:07,800
...fact may be, I am in love.

1453
01:47:08,800 --> 01:47:09,700
With you.

1454
01:47:11,400 --> 01:47:13,400
I'm not feeling this
because you're leaving.

1455
01:47:13,600 --> 01:47:15,600
And not because it feels good
to feel this way.

1456
01:47:15,800 --> 01:47:19,700
Which, by the way, it does...
Or did, before you went off like that.

1457
01:47:19,900 --> 01:47:22,000
I can't figure out
the mathematics of this.

1458
01:47:22,200 --> 01:47:25,200
I just know I love you.

1459
01:47:25,400 --> 01:47:28,100
Can't believe how many times
I'm saying it.

1460
01:47:28,300 --> 01:47:31,800
And I never thought I'd feel this way
again, so that's pretty phenomenal.

1461
01:47:32,200 --> 01:47:36,000
And I realize I come
with a package deal:

1462
01:47:36,200 --> 01:47:38,800
Three for the price of one. And my...

1463
01:47:39,200 --> 01:47:42,600
...package, perhaps in the light of day,
isn't all that wonderful...

1464
01:47:42,900 --> 01:47:48,000
...but I finally know what I want,
and that, in itself, is a miracle.

1465
01:47:49,500 --> 01:47:51,600
And what I want...

1466
01:47:52,200 --> 01:47:53,700
...is you.

1467
01:48:03,900 --> 01:48:06,400
I wasn't expecting "I love you."

1468
01:48:13,900 --> 01:48:16,500
Can you not look at me like that?

1469
01:48:16,700 --> 01:48:19,300
I'm trying to find
the right thing to say.

1470
01:48:23,400 --> 01:48:25,800
I think if the obvious response...

1471
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:28,600
...doesn't immediately
come to you, we can...

1472
01:48:29,900 --> 01:48:31,400
...just...

1473
01:48:32,800 --> 01:48:34,600
We should just...

1474
01:48:34,800 --> 01:48:36,500
...talk about something else.

1475
01:48:36,700 --> 01:48:40,900
Like, possibly,
what a complete ass I am.

1476
01:48:41,100 --> 01:48:46,000
I do recall you promising me
you wouldn't fall in love with me.

1477
01:48:46,200 --> 01:48:47,500
Must pay better attention.

1478
01:48:48,300 --> 01:48:50,300
I've never met a guy
who talks as much as me.

1479
01:48:51,700 --> 01:48:53,000
But could you just for now...

1480
01:48:53,700 --> 01:48:55,400
...be quiet?

1481
01:48:55,700 --> 01:48:56,700
Please?

1482
01:49:13,400 --> 01:49:15,900
How many of his movies
are on that list of his?

1483
01:49:16,100 --> 01:49:17,700
About 15. I love it.

1484
01:49:17,900 --> 01:49:20,700
I don't know how I've never seen
The Lady Eve before.

1485
01:49:20,900 --> 01:49:22,600
Barbara Stanwyck is dazzling.

1486
01:49:22,800 --> 01:49:25,600
- And she's so sure of herself.
- And sexy.

1487
01:49:25,800 --> 01:49:28,300
Really sexy! You know,
every movie he's told me to see...

1488
01:49:28,500 --> 01:49:31,300
...has this powerhouse woman in it.
- Wonder if he's trying...

1489
01:49:31,500 --> 01:49:36,300
...to tell you something with that.
Okay, sorry about that. Boob graze.

1490
01:49:37,800 --> 01:49:41,000
That was accidental.
Accidental boob graze.

1491
01:49:43,600 --> 01:49:45,400
I'm sorry.

1492
01:49:46,700 --> 01:49:49,000
- Changing subject.
- Okay.

1493
01:49:49,300 --> 01:49:51,800
Arthur has requested...

1494
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:55,100
...that you write some lyrics
for his theme song.

1495
01:49:55,300 --> 01:49:57,000
What's the matter? Who is it?

1496
01:49:57,200 --> 01:49:58,200
It's Maggie.

1497
01:50:00,400 --> 01:50:01,600
Hello?

1498
01:50:03,400 --> 01:50:05,000
Hi.

1499
01:50:06,700 --> 01:50:08,800
I'm doing okay.

1500
01:50:10,900 --> 01:50:14,900
Actually, Maggie,
I'm a bit tied up at the moment.

1501
01:50:16,100 --> 01:50:18,200
I don't know.
What time could you be there?

1502
01:50:20,800 --> 01:50:22,700
All right, I'll be there.

1503
01:50:22,900 --> 01:50:25,200
Oh, no, no. Like, a half-hour.

1504
01:50:26,200 --> 01:50:28,200
Maybe a little longer.

1505
01:50:29,200 --> 01:50:31,300
Okay, bye.

1506
01:50:35,400 --> 01:50:37,000
She misses me.

1507
01:50:37,200 --> 01:50:41,000
You see? She came to her senses.

1508
01:50:45,500 --> 01:50:47,100
- We should get the bill.
- No!

1509
01:50:47,300 --> 01:50:49,700
No, no, take your time.
I can wait till you're finished.

1510
01:50:49,900 --> 01:50:50,900
- I'm finished.
- No.

1511
01:50:51,100 --> 01:50:54,800
- You didn't get to your spicy tuna yet.
- I'm fine, really.

1512
01:50:55,700 --> 01:50:58,200
You can go. I can get this one.

1513
01:50:58,700 --> 01:51:02,300
I'll see you later at the Writers Guild.
I mean, if you can still make it.

1514
01:51:02,500 --> 01:51:05,900
I gotta get all the way to Silver Lake,
but I'm gonna try to be there.

1515
01:51:06,900 --> 01:51:09,800
Anyway, I'm bringing the music.
I mean, I really wanna be there...

1516
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:12,300
...but I don't know how long
this is gonna take.

1517
01:51:12,500 --> 01:51:13,800
I'm sorry.

1518
01:51:15,400 --> 01:51:17,600
It's all good. Don't worry.

1519
01:51:21,500 --> 01:51:23,700
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

1520
01:52:15,100 --> 01:52:16,400
Hello.

1521
01:52:17,700 --> 01:52:21,700
Oh, Jasper! I'm just reading
your pages.

1522
01:52:22,400 --> 01:52:26,200
No, I hadn't forgotten.
I've just been busy, that's all.

1523
01:52:26,800 --> 01:52:30,400
That's not true. I was gonna call you
when I'd read...

1524
01:52:30,800 --> 01:52:32,400
What kind of surprise?

1525
01:52:32,600 --> 01:52:34,100
No, I don't see a box or anything.

1526
01:52:34,300 --> 01:52:36,300
Yes, I'm sure.

1527
01:52:36,600 --> 01:52:39,200
Hold on, let me just check
the kitchen.

1528
01:52:42,200 --> 01:52:43,700
No, not in there.

1529
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:45,500
Well, I'll go and check the gate.

1530
01:52:45,700 --> 01:52:49,400
Yes. Well, when did you send it?

1531
01:52:52,900 --> 01:52:55,100
I found your Christmas present.

1532
01:53:04,800 --> 01:53:06,000
This place suits you.

1533
01:53:06,600 --> 01:53:07,900
Yeah, right.

1534
01:53:09,100 --> 01:53:10,900
No, really.

1535
01:53:16,400 --> 01:53:19,300
So you are eventually
gonna look at me, aren't you?

1536
01:53:25,600 --> 01:53:26,900
Hello.

1537
01:53:29,600 --> 01:53:32,800
I came here
because I had to see you.

1538
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:34,700
Had to.

1539
01:53:36,300 --> 01:53:39,500
Oh, Jasper, I really don't
understand this.

1540
01:53:39,700 --> 01:53:41,300
I mean...

1541
01:53:41,500 --> 01:53:45,800
I was right there for three years!
Remember? Square peg, round hole?

1542
01:53:46,700 --> 01:53:48,000
- What?
- That's what you said.

1543
01:53:48,200 --> 01:53:50,200
That we weren't really right
for each other.

1544
01:53:50,400 --> 01:53:53,000
We were a square peg
and a round hole.

1545
01:53:53,200 --> 01:53:55,900
I don't remember that. I just know
I hated when you were gone.

1546
01:53:56,100 --> 01:53:58,600
And also, I have never checked
my e-mails more.

1547
01:53:58,800 --> 01:54:01,900
It was driving me crazy
that I wasn't hearing from you.

1548
01:54:02,900 --> 01:54:05,100
I don't want to lose you, babe.

1549
01:54:08,100 --> 01:54:09,300
Lose me?

1550
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:14,800
This is too confusing.

1551
01:54:17,800 --> 01:54:19,300
Come here.

1552
01:54:22,300 --> 01:54:25,700
I screwed up.
Miles, haven't you ever screwed up?

1553
01:54:25,900 --> 01:54:28,100
I made a mistake.

1554
01:54:29,100 --> 01:54:31,500
I was stupid and impulsive.

1555
01:54:31,700 --> 01:54:34,900
He wasn't what I thought.
I just started thinking about you...

1556
01:54:35,100 --> 01:54:38,200
...and wishing and hoping
that you would just forgive me.

1557
01:54:38,900 --> 01:54:41,100
Will you, Miles?

1558
01:54:41,300 --> 01:54:43,300
Will you forgive me?

1559
01:54:58,100 --> 01:55:00,200
You know what I was thinking?

1560
01:55:00,400 --> 01:55:01,700
When you get back to London...

1561
01:55:01,900 --> 01:55:04,700
...maybe we could sneak off
somewhere together.

1562
01:55:04,900 --> 01:55:06,600
Maybe venice.

1563
01:55:06,800 --> 01:55:08,400
You and me in venice
could be good.

1564
01:55:10,400 --> 01:55:12,800
Do you mean that? I mean...

1565
01:55:13,400 --> 01:55:15,300
Are you free to do that?

1566
01:55:16,600 --> 01:55:18,000
Darling...

1567
01:55:18,200 --> 01:55:22,200
...I've just traveled halfway across
the world to see you, haven't I?

1568
01:55:27,800 --> 01:55:31,900
Yeah, that doesn't exactly
answer my question, so...

1569
01:55:32,100 --> 01:55:36,200
Are you not with
Sarah anymore? I mean...

1570
01:55:36,400 --> 01:55:38,800
...is that what you've come here
to tell me?

1571
01:55:39,900 --> 01:55:43,600
I wish you could just accept knowing
how confused I am about all this.

1572
01:55:45,700 --> 01:55:48,600
Okay, let me translate that.

1573
01:55:48,800 --> 01:55:52,200
So you are still engaged
to be married.

1574
01:55:54,400 --> 01:55:58,200
- Yes, but, I mean...
- Oh, my God.

1575
01:56:00,100 --> 01:56:02,400
Okay, this was a really...

1576
01:56:02,600 --> 01:56:03,700
...close call.

1577
01:56:03,900 --> 01:56:06,500
You know, I never thought
I'd say this, literally never...

1578
01:56:06,700 --> 01:56:09,700
...but I think you were
absolutely right about us.

1579
01:56:09,900 --> 01:56:12,100
Very square peg, very round hole!

1580
01:56:12,300 --> 01:56:16,100
- You cannot mean that.
- The great thing is I actually do.

1581
01:56:16,300 --> 01:56:18,600
And I'm about three years late
in telling you this...

1582
01:56:18,800 --> 01:56:21,500
...but nevertheless I need to say it.

1583
01:56:21,900 --> 01:56:23,400
Jasper...

1584
01:56:23,600 --> 01:56:24,800
Wait. I need the lights on.

1585
01:56:29,300 --> 01:56:30,300
Jasper...

1586
01:56:33,400 --> 01:56:34,900
...you have never treated me right.

1587
01:56:35,200 --> 01:56:36,700
- Ever.
- Oh, babe.

1588
01:56:38,200 --> 01:56:40,700
You broke my heart.

1589
01:56:40,900 --> 01:56:43,300
And you acted like
somehow it was my fault...

1590
01:56:43,500 --> 01:56:46,400
...my misunderstanding,
and I was too in love with you...

1591
01:56:46,600 --> 01:56:50,400
...to ever be mad at you, so I just
punished myself! For years!

1592
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:54,600
But you waltzing in here
on my lovely Christmas holiday...

1593
01:56:54,800 --> 01:56:57,000
...and telling me that
you don't want to lose me...

1594
01:56:57,200 --> 01:56:59,600
...whilst you're
about to get married...

1595
01:56:59,800 --> 01:57:02,500
...somehow newly entitles me
to say...

1596
01:57:04,700 --> 01:57:05,700
...it's over.

1597
01:57:06,500 --> 01:57:11,900
This... This twisted,
toxic thing between us...

1598
01:57:12,100 --> 01:57:14,200
...is finally finished!

1599
01:57:14,400 --> 01:57:18,200
I'm miraculously done
being in love with you!

1600
01:57:19,200 --> 01:57:21,600
I've got a life to start living.

1601
01:57:23,300 --> 01:57:25,900
- And you're not going to be in it.
- Darling...

1602
01:57:26,100 --> 01:57:28,400
Now I've got somewhere
really important to be...

1603
01:57:28,600 --> 01:57:31,500
...and you have
got to get the hell out.

1604
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:34,400
- Now!
- What exactly has got into you?

1605
01:57:35,300 --> 01:57:36,800
I don't know.

1606
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:40,800
But I think what I've got
is something slightly resembling...

1607
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:42,400
...gumption.

1608
01:58:07,300 --> 01:58:09,100
Iris...

1609
01:58:09,400 --> 01:58:11,600
...you're a knockout.

1610
01:58:11,900 --> 01:58:13,200
Thank you.

1611
01:58:13,400 --> 01:58:17,300
- And may I say, so are you.
- Did I do my tie okay?

1612
01:58:17,500 --> 01:58:20,600
I haven't worn one in 15 years.

1613
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:25,000
- It's perfect.
- I like this Hugo Boss.

1614
01:58:25,200 --> 01:58:26,700
He cuts a nice suit.

1615
01:58:27,700 --> 01:58:29,800
I've got something for you.

1616
01:58:37,700 --> 01:58:42,100
Forgive me. The last time
I had a date, this is what we did.

1617
01:58:42,900 --> 01:58:44,600
It's beautiful.

1618
01:58:46,100 --> 01:58:49,500
If it's corny, or if it's
going to ruin your outfit...

1619
01:58:49,700 --> 01:58:52,000
...you don't have to wear it.

1620
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:55,200
I like corny.

1621
01:58:55,700 --> 01:58:57,800
I'm looking for corny in my life.

1622
01:58:58,700 --> 01:59:02,400
- That's a nice line.
- It's all those movies!

1623
01:59:02,600 --> 01:59:05,100
Okay, let's do it.

1624
01:59:05,300 --> 01:59:07,500
Let's get this embarrassment
over with.

1625
01:59:07,700 --> 01:59:09,600
Okay.

1626
01:59:17,100 --> 01:59:19,300
- Mr. Abbott?
- Yes, sir.

1627
01:59:19,500 --> 01:59:21,600
We're all ready for you.

1628
01:59:34,700 --> 01:59:38,700
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Arthur Abbott!

1629
02:00:01,400 --> 02:00:04,400
- Oh, hi!
- Arthur, you made it.

1630
02:00:05,500 --> 02:00:06,900
Thank you. Thank you too.

1631
02:00:11,400 --> 02:00:12,400
Thank you very much.

1632
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:19,100
I'll take you up, Mr. Abbott.

1633
02:00:20,500 --> 02:00:22,700
Go on, go for it.

1634
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:41,000
I'll do it.

1635
02:00:53,200 --> 02:00:54,900
The man is a rock star.

1636
02:00:55,800 --> 02:00:56,900
Hi!

1637
02:01:00,400 --> 02:01:03,400
Sorry I'm late. The Maggie thing
took a little time, but it is over.

1638
02:01:03,600 --> 02:01:05,500
Finished, kaput.

1639
02:01:07,600 --> 02:01:08,600
You look beautiful.

1640
02:01:10,300 --> 02:01:11,600
Thank you.

1641
02:01:11,800 --> 02:01:13,200
Thanks.

1642
02:01:13,400 --> 02:01:15,200
Thank you, thank you.

1643
02:01:15,400 --> 02:01:16,700
I'm...

1644
02:01:16,900 --> 02:01:20,300
I'm absolutely overwhelmed...

1645
02:01:21,200 --> 02:01:22,800
...that I could climb those stairs.

1646
02:01:24,200 --> 02:01:25,100
He did great.

1647
02:01:25,900 --> 02:01:29,300
I came to Hollywood
over 60 years ago...

1648
02:01:29,500 --> 02:01:32,100
...and immediately fell in love
with motion pictures.

1649
02:01:32,700 --> 02:01:36,500
And it's a love affair
that's lasted a lifetime.

1650
02:01:36,700 --> 02:01:39,600
When I first arrived in Tinseltown...

1651
02:01:39,800 --> 02:01:43,500
...there were no cineplexes
or multiplexes.

1652
02:01:43,700 --> 02:01:47,900
No such thing as a
Blockbuster or DvD.

1653
02:01:48,100 --> 02:01:51,400
I was here before conglomerates
owned the studios.

1654
02:01:52,100 --> 02:01:55,600
Before pictures
had special effects teams.

1655
02:01:55,800 --> 02:01:59,400
And definitely before box office
results were reported...

1656
02:01:59,600 --> 02:02:02,900
...like baseball scores
on the nightly news.

1657
02:02:03,400 --> 02:02:06,400
He is so fantastic.

1658
02:02:06,900 --> 02:02:09,800
- Iris?
- Yes?

1659
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:12,400
What are you doing
New Year's Eve?

1660
02:02:13,900 --> 02:02:15,800
I'll be back in England
by New Year's Eve.

1661
02:02:19,500 --> 02:02:22,000
You know, I've never been
to England.

1662
02:02:22,500 --> 02:02:25,600
- I've never been to Europe.
- No?

1663
02:02:26,100 --> 02:02:29,000
If I come over there, will you go out
with me on New Year's Eve?

1664
02:02:33,800 --> 02:02:35,100
Love to.

1665
02:02:56,300 --> 02:02:59,200
We're not gonna make a bigger deal
out of this than it already is.

1666
02:02:59,400 --> 02:03:00,800
No, we're not.

1667
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:03,500
It's not like we're never
going to speak or e-mail or...

1668
02:03:03,700 --> 02:03:06,600
- No set rules.
- None.

1669
02:03:07,800 --> 02:03:11,100
So now I'm just gonna
kiss you for the millionth time...

1670
02:03:11,300 --> 02:03:12,800
...and say, "Be seeing you."

1671
02:03:28,800 --> 02:03:30,700
Be seeing you.

1672
02:03:35,600 --> 02:03:37,600
Take care of yourself.

1673
02:04:39,500 --> 02:04:41,400
Did you have a good holiday, miss?

1674
02:04:42,200 --> 02:04:43,800
Yeah.

1675
02:04:44,500 --> 02:04:45,900
Great.

1676
02:04:48,700 --> 02:04:50,900
Maybe the best ever.

1677
02:05:45,400 --> 02:05:47,300
Amanda Woods...

1678
02:05:47,500 --> 02:05:49,200
...welcome back.

1679
02:05:51,300 --> 02:05:53,100
Turn around!

1680
02:05:53,700 --> 02:05:55,500
Turn around and go back, please!

1681
02:05:55,700 --> 02:05:59,200
- Did you forget something?
- Yes! Yes.

1682
02:06:10,400 --> 02:06:11,700
Can you go any faster?

1683
02:06:11,900 --> 02:06:13,700
This lane's tricky.
It's gonna take a bit.

1684
02:06:13,900 --> 02:06:15,200
It's okay, just stop.

1685
02:06:21,800 --> 02:06:22,800
Madam?

1686
02:06:23,900 --> 02:06:25,400
Madam!

1687
02:07:20,600 --> 02:07:22,200
Graham?

1688
02:07:23,300 --> 02:07:25,100
Graham.

1689
02:07:37,500 --> 02:07:39,100
You know...

1690
02:07:39,300 --> 02:07:41,600
...I was just thinking...

1691
02:07:42,800 --> 02:07:45,200
...why would I ever leave
before New Year's Eve?

1692
02:07:45,800 --> 02:07:48,300
That makes no sense at all.

1693
02:07:48,500 --> 02:07:51,200
I mean, you didn't exactly
ask me out...

1694
02:07:53,400 --> 02:07:55,800
...but you did say you loved me...

1695
02:07:56,200 --> 02:07:58,800
...so I'm thinking I've got a date.

1696
02:07:59,400 --> 02:08:00,500
If you'll have me.

1697
02:08:03,200 --> 02:08:05,100
I have the girls New Year's Eve.

1698
02:08:08,100 --> 02:08:09,300
Sounds perfect.

1699
02:08:28,800 --> 02:08:30,800
I'm coming to get you!

1700
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:35,300
You look just like an angel
on the top of the Christmas tree.

1701
02:08:35,500 --> 02:08:38,000
You got so big. Give us a kiss.

1702
02:08:38,500 --> 02:08:41,300
Come and tell me all about
your Christmas presents.

1703
02:08:41,800 --> 02:08:43,100
Go sit with Miles.

1704
02:08:53,000 --> 02:08:54,000
Sweetie.

1705
02:09:30,800 --> 02:09:33,800
- I challenge ye.
- Me?

1706
02:09:54,400 --> 02:09:56,500
The love train
is leaving the station.

1707
02:10:11,300 --> 02:10:13,500
- Happy New Year!
- Happy New Year!

1708
02:10:13,700 --> 02:10:15,700
Happy New Year!

1709
02:10:15,900 --> 02:10:19,900
Happy New Year, everybody!
