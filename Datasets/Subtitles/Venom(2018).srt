00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,629

You are a go for reentry.</i>

14
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:45,329
I don't want to have to wait
for full clean-up just to get

15
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:47,029
- a status report.
- We're collecting this data

16
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:49,029
- as quickly as possible.
- That's not good enough.

17
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:50,599
Okay, maybe you can tell me
what happened.

18
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,399
There was some kind of breach.
One of the astronauts

19
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,769
- sent a distress call.
- What about the crew?

20
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:58,399
- We're still investigating.
- Where did it go down?

21
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,399
It's 20 kilometers
west of Sibu.

22
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,599
Did we at least retrieve
all of the samples?

23
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,399
No. We have
three of them.

24
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,369
One of the organisms
got out of containment,

25
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:10,035
and it's missing.
We don't know which one.

26
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:24,469
What is she saying?

27
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:27,205
One of the astronauts
is still alive.

28
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:34,205
That's Jameson.

29
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,799
- Morning, sunshine.
- What?

30
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,845
I'm awake.

31
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:02,669
Missed me.

32
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:04,369
- I'm awake.
- Here you go.

33
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:06,899
- You can have it back.
- Thank...

34
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:09,939
Oh, wow,
you're wearing a suit. Yes!

35
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:12,439
- I love it when you wear the suit.
- Thank you.

36
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,739
I have depositions today
in the Life Foundation case.

37
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:16,999
Hey, let me know
how your meeting goes.

38
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,639
My meeting?

39
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,499
Oh, shit. Yeah.

40
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:23,005
My meeting.

41
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,899
- Coffee.
- Oh. Mmm!

42
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:30,799
- You are perfect.
- Thank you.

43
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,699
Hey, you know what...
You know what night

44
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,539
- it is tonight, right?
- Date night.

45
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:37,469
Mmm-hmm. So, I will pick
you up around, uh, 6:00.

46
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:39,899
And please do not forget
your helmet.

47
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,469
Oh, I'm glad
that you like it,

48
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:42,969
'cause I plan on wearing it
at our wedding.

49
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:44,699
That's hot.

50
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,599
Feed the cat.

51
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,899
I will.

52
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,439
I love you!

53
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,645
Love you, too.
Feed the cat.

Hey, Richard!

72
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:56,369
- Lookin' good!
- Eddie, you can't park there, bro.

73
00:06:56,370 --> 00:06:58,469
Come on, man. There's
no such thing as can't.

74
00:06:58,470 --> 00:06:59,739
How'd she do?

75
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:02,669
Berkeley. Brown. MIT.

76
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:04,669
- She's got a scholarship, bro.
- What'd I tell you?

77
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:06,369
You told me what?

78
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:08,715
- No such thing as can't.
- Eddie.

79
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:10,669
The bike.

80
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:14,069
MIT! Whoo!

81
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:17,539
You know what I love
about this view?

82
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:20,369
- It never gets old.
- Yeah, well, uh...

83
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:23,039
Height's not really my thing.

84
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,609
But, uh...
What's the deal?

85
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:27,979
- I got you the big one, exclusive.
- Yeah? Who?

86
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:29,609
Carlton Drake.

87
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:31,639
- Carlton Drake?
- The man's a visionary.

88
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,839
He wants to talk
about his rockets,

89
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,539
assure everyone they're safe,
that the crash was an anomaly.

90
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:37,909
Uh...

91
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:39,909
He's... He's seriously off.

92
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:41,609
I'm gonna level with you.

93
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:44,009
Carlton Drake could buy us
with his pocket cash,

94
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:47,439
turn this building into his
own garage if he so wished.

95
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,439
Now, you're just gonna ask him
about his space program,

96
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:53,445
you're gonna thank him, and
you're gonna bid him a nice day.

97
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:57,769
He's a crook.

98
00:07:57,770 --> 00:08:00,979
Eddie, when you had nowhere
to go, we gave you a home.

99
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,369
Now, you know we love
the Eddie Brock show.

100
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:06,079
There isn't a better investigative
reporter working today,

101
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,839
but no one
is above the network.

102
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,909
So do me a favor, Eddie,
don't start your shit again.

103
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:12,609
All right, all right.

104
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:16,979
- For me.
- All right. I'll do it.

105
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:18,639
I don't know why he gave
me this assignment, Annie.

106
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,439
It's not...
It's not what I do.

107
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,979
Well, my mother
always told me

108
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:24,939
that anything in life worth
having would take sacrifice...

109
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:26,379
- Mmm-hmm.
- Patience...

110
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:28,579
- Mmm.
- And be a lot of work.

111
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:30,009
- Oh.
- That's you...

112
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:31,679
- That's not.
- ...that I'm talking about.

113
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,879
- Nah.
- Yeah.

114
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,079
Well, you're lucky
to have me.

115
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,079
To be fair,
I'm quite a catch.

116
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,539
That's what my mom told me.

117
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:40,579
Are you gonna
behave yourself tomorrow?

118
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:43,809
No. No, I'm gonna do my job.
That's what I'm gonna do.

119
00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:45,879
I can't, you know,
not do my job.

120
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,739
The guy you work for
is a complete...

121
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:49,809
I don't work for Drake.
I work for my firm,

122
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:51,439
and my firm works for him.

123
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,909
And I'm sure
that they defend many people

124
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:57,009
that you don't deem worthy,
but we don't want a repeat.

125
00:08:57,010 --> 00:08:59,779
- A repeat?
- Of the <i>Daily Globe</i> incident.

126
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:01,509
Ow! Really?

127
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:03,339
- Incident? That's not an incident.
- Mmm-hmm.

128
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:04,609
- Baby, you were run out of New York.
- I was not. I did not.

129
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:06,009
I don't want you
run out of San Francisco.

130
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:08,539
No, I still have
currency in New York.

131
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:10,839
I was going places.

132
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,939
I wasn't running.

133
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:13,709
I was going places.

134
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:15,539
In fact, I moved
to San Francisco for you.

135
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:18,709
- Me?
- You are my home.

136
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:22,045
You're not so bad yourself,
champ.

137
00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:27,109
- Less talking, more kissing.
- All right.

138
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:28,985
Let's just get the check.

139
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:58,685
I'm gonna get a drink.

140
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:44,315
Shh.

141
00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:02,279
Very soon,
another Life Foundation rocket

142
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,849
will be sent
on an exploratory mission.

143
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:08,109
And that's how, one day,
we might all live in space.

144
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:10,809
Cool, huh? And now that I've shown you

145
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:12,949
some of the cool stuff
that we do here,

146
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:15,219
I'm hoping I've inspired
each and every one of you

147
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:17,419
to go out there
and create things that others

148
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:19,809
- have only dreamt of.
- Mr. Drake?

149
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:22,879
- Shh!
- It's okay. Don't silence her.

150
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,809
Come here. What's your name?

151
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:26,849
- Allie.
- It's okay, Allie.

152
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:28,649
You know, sometimes
that's what people do.

153
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:31,119
They try and silence
those of us who ask questions.

154
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,179
But you know what?
In the end,

155
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:36,119
we're the ones
who change the world.

156
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:39,049
Take good care
of that, Allie.

157
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:40,809
Guys, this is Dr. Skirth.

158
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:42,179
- Say hi.
- Hi.

159
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:43,379
Hello, kids.

160
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:45,419
Um, sorry to interrupt,

161
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:47,779
but it's time to get changed
for your interview.

162
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:49,979
Yeah. Uh, kids,
sorry to leave you.

163
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:52,279
Allie, you're in charge.
High five up top.

164
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:55,749
Dr. Skirth will answer Allie's
question, and any others.

165
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,649
- See you next time, guys. Bye!
- Bye!

166
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:59,679
<i>What do you say,
Mr. Drake,</i>

167
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,419
we just start
at the beginning?

168
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,679
- Born to British parents.
- Mmm-hmm.

169
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,979
And then at 19, you
discovered a gene therapy

170
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:09,779
that literally doubles
the life expectancy

171
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:11,279
- of pancreatic cancer patients.
- Well, actually,

172
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,649
it tripled their
life expectancy.

173
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:15,319
But it's okay.

174
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:18,349
Okay, um, 24.
That's still extremely young.

175
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:20,349
All right, you create

176
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:22,049
- the Life Foundation!
- It didn't happen overnight.

177
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:23,719
- And then...
- Rockets.

178
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,949
You then decide,
like any normal human being,

179
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:27,949
that you're gonna go
and explore space.

180
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:30,249
You know what it is?
I have always believed...

181
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,079
- Uh-huh.
- ...that space exploration

182
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,679
is crucial
in our quest to cure

183
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,619
everything that ails us
here on Earth.

184
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:37,179
But if you think about
everything we've found...

185
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:38,619
- Uh-huh.
- ...in the oceans and on land,

186
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:40,549
- isn't it time to look up there?
- Mmm-hmm.

187
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:43,049
To this plethora
of untapped resources?

188
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:44,549
And you have a plethora
of untapped resources, also,

189
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:46,379
from your pharmaceutical
companies

190
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:48,179
that you're involved with,
you know, to help you realize

191
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:49,379
- that ambition, I suppose.
- Of course.

192
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:50,719
- Yeah.
- Full circle.

193
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,019
So, I have to ask,
how does that work,

194
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:54,619
you know, exactly,
the Life Foundation thing?

195
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:56,619
How does it...
How does it, um...

196
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:58,549
I don't know,
how does it go about,

197
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:01,619
- say, testing pharmaceuticals?
- Eddie, we're talking

198
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:03,449
- about the rocket here.
- No, I'm not. I'm not.

199
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:05,449
I'm talking
about the allegations.

200
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:07,049
- I'm sorry, I don't...
- It says that

201
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:08,549
your entire empire
has been built

202
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:10,619
- on dead bodies.
- Eddie.

203
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:13,049
It's true, right?
It says that you recruit

204
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:15,249
the most vulnerable of us
to volunteer for tests...

205
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:16,589
- Hmm.
- ...that more often than not

206
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:18,149
end up killing people.

207
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:19,649
Yeah, I'm aware
of these rumors online.

208
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:21,019
There's a lot of fake news
out there these days.

209
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:22,449
Right. What about
the legal cases?

210
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:24,019
Sorry?

211
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:26,149
Uh, the actual legal cases,
like Sarah Chambers,

212
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:28,089
- Phil Barclay, Rob MacDonald.
- That's it. Time to go.

213
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:29,419
Thank you so much for coming
to talk to me, Mr. Brock.

214
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:31,019
And they're just some
of the people who walked

215
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:33,019
- through these doors...
- Have a nice day.

216
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,689
- Cut the camera off, please.
- Thank you very much.

217
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:36,389
- Time is up. Come on.
- They're dead. The Dead...

218
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:37,649
- Could you show him out, please?
- The Dead Found...

219
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,449
Don't touch me.
The Dead Foundation thing.

220
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:40,319
- Get out of here, Brock.
- We're not finished.

221
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,189
Yes, you are, Mr. Brock.

222
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:42,049
Is that a threat?

223
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:44,295
Have a nice life.

224
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:49,349
I know what
you're going to say, but...

225
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:52,019
This guy, he is
all the way bad, Jack.

226
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:54,049
- If you just give...
- Who's your source?

227
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:57,195
- Excuse me?
- Who's your source, Eddie?

228
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:04,019
I don't have a source, per se.
But I have a hunch.

229
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:05,989
This isn't the Wild Wild West.

230
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:08,719
We don't go off half-cocked
based on a hunch.

231
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,289
We do the work.

232
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:12,989
We substantiate
our accusations.

233
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:15,049
We provide evidence.

234
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:18,995
You know, for a smart guy,
you really are a dumb-ass.

235
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:26,319
You're fired, Eddie.

236
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,319
I can't trust you.

237
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,959
Have a nice life.

238
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:33,325
- Will just take a second.
- Okay.

239
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:35,589
Hey.

240
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:37,589
You are pathologically
self-absorbed.

241
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:39,119
Annie. Annie,
can you talk to me first?

242
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,149
Your ego requires
constant attention,

243
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:42,219
and you're stubborn as hell.

244
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:44,449
But I was willing to roll with
it, Eddie, because I loved you.

245
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:47,225
You "loved" me?
What is that supposed to mean?

246
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:51,255
What you did
got me fired.

247
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:54,095
You used me.

248
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:04,125
Annie? Annie.

249
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,725
Oh, my God.

250
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:43,865
You're beautiful.

251
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:42,189
Test 36.

252
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:43,729
Biological interactions

253
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:46,059
between two different organisms.

254
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:48,659
These creatures need to bond
with a respiratory host

255
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:50,689
in order to survive
for any amount of time

256
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:52,529
in an oxygen-rich environment.

257
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:53,959
Well, why are
all these hosts

258
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,499
showing this hyper-acute
rejection?

259
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:58,065
That's what
we're trying to find out.

260
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:02,305
The bonding process
is starting.

261
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:08,795
It's equalizing.

262
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:17,259
But why? Why this rabbit?

263
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:19,959
- It's similar to an organ transplant.
- Huh.

264
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:22,699
Where the donor and recipient
must be an exact match?

265
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:25,259
- That's correct.
- Okay. So wait, think about it.

266
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:29,129
If we do achieve symbiosis, they
should be able to survive here,

267
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:33,429
but also we would
be able to survive there.

268
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:35,129
"We"?

269
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:37,259
- Begin human trials.
- Oh, it's way too soon

270
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:39,229
to even begin to think
about something like...

271
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:40,659
Dr. Skirth, you're at the forefront
of a scientific breakthrough.

272
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:43,159
I need you to hold your nerve.
All right?

273
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,959
I understand,
but it's an ethical question.

274
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,699
Think of future generations.
Think of your kids.

275
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:49,165
Hey, how are your kids?

276
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,099
Let's begin human trials.

277
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:53,835
Good work.

278
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:17,265
Hey, Jack.

279
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,629
Do you ever feel
like your life

280
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:24,259
- is like one monumental screwup?
- Nope.

281
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:25,999
<i>Here at the Life Foundation,</i>

282
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,029
- <i>we've always believed...</i>
- Isn't that your buddy?

283
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:29,499
<i>...in finding the lessons
in our disappointments.</i>

284
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,199
<i>In the months
since our rocket failed,</i>

285
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,729
<i>we've learned so much.</i>

286
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:35,969
Do you think we could,
like, switch him off?

287
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:37,429
Some people
are trying to watch that.

288
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:38,969
Oh, you are, are you?

289
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:41,935
- Yeah?
- Aren't you Eddie Brock?

290
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:44,969
I used to be.

291
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:46,629
<i>We take
the same view of progress.</i>

292
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:49,259
<i>Thrilled to announce
that the Life Foundation</i>

293
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:52,229
<i>has now begun preparations
on its next launch.</i>

294
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:53,629
All right, Jack,
this is for you.

295
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:55,599
I do not want you
to spend it all at once.

296
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,629
I'm going to go home and chase
myself around the room,

297
00:19:57,630 --> 00:20:00,235
playing hard to get.

298
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:05,099
- Hey, Maria.
- Eddie.

299
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:07,729
- How's it going?
- Righteous, Eddie.

300
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:10,335
Oh! Yeah, we're empty.

301
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:14,099
Cost you $5.

302
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:16,229
$5 for a paper that's free?

303
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:18,229
I walked all the way over
to the vending machine,

304
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:21,029
got the papers out and
brought 'em back over here,

305
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:23,499
so you can have 'em
personally delivered to you.

306
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:24,569
You did that for me?

307
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:26,775
- Yes, I did.
- Oh.

308
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:30,229
- Five bucks.
- That's pretty steep.

309
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:32,669
Tell you what, you give
me a dollar for a song,

310
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:34,329
I'll throw in the paper.

311
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:37,069
I'll tell you what,
I will give you 20 bucks,

312
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:39,135
but not to sing,
all right?

313
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:40,299
Deal.

314
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:42,199
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

315
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:46,029
No. You're welcome.

316
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:48,329
Hey, Mrs. Chen.

317
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:50,599
- How you doing, Eddie?
- Ah, aches and pains,

318
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,599
you know, aches and pains.

319
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,375
You look like shit.

320
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:56,169
Excuse me?

321
00:20:56,170 --> 00:20:58,135
You look like shit.

322
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:01,729
And you look
as beautiful as ever.

323
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:04,469
- Jesus.
- Mind is body, Eddie.

324
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:06,329
Have you been meditating
like I showed you?

325
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:08,329
- No, I have not. And it does not work.
- It doesn't work,

326
00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:10,469
- because you don't give it a chance.
- No, it doesn't work,

327
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:13,669
because I bought a DVD off your
cousin, and it was in Mandarin.

328
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:16,469
Yeah, I don't understand that, either.

329
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:18,199
See, that right there, I don't
understand what you just said.

330
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,975
That is the problem.

331
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:27,229
Bottle of whiskey,
and don't forget my change.

332
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:29,629
Please.

333
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:31,099
Let's go.

334
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:33,205
Before the price goes up
for my protection.

335
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:38,639
The full payment is due.
Now.

336
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,739
Make sure you have
my money ready, Chen.

337
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:43,045
I don't like to wait.

338
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,305
Life hurts, Eddie.

339
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,305
It just does.

340
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:24,039
I gotta go.

341
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:28,705
- Okay. Love you, babe.
- See you, babe.

342
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,345
What a dick.

343
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,069
I'm not even
asking to staff there.

344
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:05,599
Why would I do that?
I can't use my name.

345
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,069
I can use a pseudonym.

346
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:08,539
Any name. Think...
You pick a name.

347
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:11,145
I could be a woman.
Have you seen <i>Tootsie?</i>

348
00:23:16,370 --> 00:23:17,439
<i>I'll call you back.</i>

349
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,905
Okay, I won't. Thank you. Bye.

350
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:30,739
<i>Realize deeply that the
present moment is all you ever have.</i>

351
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:34,569
<i>Make the now the primary
focus of your life.</i>

352
00:23:34,570 --> 00:23:37,039
<i>Any action is often better
than no action,</i>

353
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,669
<i>especially if you
have been stuck</i>

354
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:42,409
<i>in an unhappy situation
for a long time.</i>

355
00:23:42,410 --> 00:23:45,409
<i>If it is a mistake, at least
you learned something,</i>

356
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:47,645
<i>in which case
it's no longer...</i>

357
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:09,269
Thank you all for
bringing us to this moment.

358
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:13,709
Our names will be spoken
long after we are dust.

359
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:15,975
History starts now.

360
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:18,069
This is day one.

361
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:21,739
This is first contact.

362
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:24,715
Let's get to work.

363
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:39,675
<i>Establishing subject baseline.</i>

364
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:44,015
<i>All vital signs are normal.</i>

365
00:24:50,010 --> 00:24:52,139
Put me through.

366
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:54,575
There's no need to be
frightened, Isaac.

367
00:24:56,410 --> 00:24:57,769
There's no need.

368
00:24:57,770 --> 00:25:00,809
Isaac. You know
that's a biblical name?

369
00:25:00,810 --> 00:25:02,839
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

370
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,969
<i>God said to Abraham,
"Give me your son,</i>

371
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:07,709
<i>"show me you are willing
to sacrifice the one thing</i>

372
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:10,869
"most precious to you,"
and Abraham was willing.

373
00:25:10,870 --> 00:25:12,939
You know what's always
impressed me about that story?

374
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:16,615
<i>It isn't Abraham's sacrifice.
It's Isaac's.</i>

375
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,539
<i>Now, I don't know what kind of
God would ask that of someone,</i>

376
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:24,879
<i>but it doesn't change
anything for me.</i>

377
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:29,679
Isaac is still the hero
of this story.

378
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:32,579
Look around you.
Look at the world.

379
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:34,039
<i>What do you see?
War, poverty,</i>

380
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:36,409
<i>a planet on the brink
of collapse.</i>

381
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:39,479
<i>I would argue that God
has abandoned us.</i>

382
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,109
He didn't keep
his end of the bargain, Isaac,

383
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:44,139
<i>so now it's down to you and me
to put this right.</i>

384
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:47,285
<i>And this time, Isaac,
we can.</i>

385
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,679
We will.

386
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:56,345
<i>This time,
I will not abandon us.</i>

387
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,745
<i>Yes.</i>

388
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,645
Open it.

389
00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:18,109
What the hell is that?
What? No, what...

390
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:19,839
<i>Please let me... No.</i>

391
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,615
Oh, please, please, please!

392
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,139
His vitals are holding steady.

393
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:44,849
- Where the hell did it go?
- <i>Incredible.</i>

394
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:47,015
<i>Where did it go?</i>

395
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:53,185
<i>Where is it?</i>

396
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:32,455
Bring in the next volunteer.

397
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,579
You know,
I used to be a reporter.

398
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:04,979
I was...

399
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:07,709
I was pretty successful,
as well, you know?

400
00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:11,879
My job, it required you to...
You know, to follow people

401
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:17,409
that did not want to be followed
and hide in plain sight.

402
00:28:17,410 --> 00:28:18,979
I mean...

403
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:21,385
You have to know
how to disappear.

404
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:25,849
I was pretty good, but,
you know, you...

405
00:28:25,850 --> 00:28:28,385
Whoever you are, you suck.

406
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:30,749
Okay.

407
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:32,809
- Uh, my name is Dora Skirth.
- Mmm.

408
00:28:32,810 --> 00:28:34,149
I need your help.

409
00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:35,849
- I work at the Life Foundation.
- You do?

410
00:28:35,850 --> 00:28:37,579
- Yes.
- Wow. Good for you.

411
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:39,579
We're done.

412
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:41,179
No...

413
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:44,509
Mr. Brock, please...
Please listen to me.

414
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:46,579
Everything that you
accused him of,

415
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:47,919
you were right.
It's all true.

416
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,449
- I don't care anymore.
- Really?

417
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:51,509
Because he's got a lab
filled with poor people,

418
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:53,849
and they're all signing waivers
that they don't understand,

419
00:28:53,850 --> 00:28:55,679
and he's using them
like guinea pigs,

420
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,749
and they are dying.

421
00:28:57,750 --> 00:28:59,849
They are all dying.

422
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:02,025
- You've seen that?
- Yes.

423
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:04,185
Come here.

424
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:06,819
Why would I believe you?

425
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:07,979
Because it's true.

426
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:09,749
I believed in him, and I...

427
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:11,679
I told myself
that it was worth it

428
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,849
because we were curing cancer,
but now this is different.

429
00:29:13,850 --> 00:29:15,419
- Something else.
- Go to the cops.

430
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:16,719
I can't do that.

431
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,519
I'm afraid of what
will happen to my family.

432
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:20,149
He's a very dangerous man, and
he's a very powerful man...

433
00:29:20,150 --> 00:29:21,819
I know, I know
how dangerous he is,

434
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:23,479
because the very first time
I interviewed him,

435
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,679
just once, I lose my job
the very next day.

436
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:28,049
I lost my career,
I lost my relationship,

437
00:29:28,050 --> 00:29:30,819
I lost my apartment, I lost
everything I ever cared about.

438
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:33,725
You know why? Carlton Drake
ruined me. Finished.

439
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:36,649
Now, if you are
who you say you are,

440
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:38,949
genuinely,
and you have proof,

441
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:42,019
then you should be
very, very, very afraid.

442
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:44,049
I am.

443
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:46,049
You need to find yourself another
white knight, Ms. Skirth,

444
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:47,519
because I am done.

445
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,485
I am done
with all of this shit.

446
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:51,119
What shit?

447
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:54,079
All of this "saving my
fellow man" shit.

448
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:56,255
All right? Good night.

449
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:17,425
Eddie?

450
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,419
Well, hey. Whoa.

451
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:22,449
Anne, I was just walking by,
and, uh...

452
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:23,779
I saw Mr. Belvedere.

453
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:25,549
I felt concerned for
his welfare, so...

454
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:27,389
Eddie...

455
00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:28,989
This is Dan.

456
00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:31,019
- Dan, this is Eddie.
- Yeah.

457
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:32,749
- Hey.
- Hey, man.

458
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:34,419
- Yeah.
- Annie's told me a lot about you.

459
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:35,479
- Really?
- Yeah.

460
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:37,489
I'm a big fan of your work.

461
00:30:37,490 --> 00:30:39,819
- Thank you.
- Really?

462
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:42,625
It's pretty cool, all the
people that he took down.

463
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:45,055
Yeah, I was one of them.

464
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:47,989
Well, look,
I'll let you guys catch up.

465
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:50,225
- So I'll see you inside?
- You're the best.

466
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:54,095
- Really nice meeting you, man.
- Uh, you, too.

467
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:03,295
He has a key. You know he has a key?

468
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:06,655
Yeah. How else
would he get in?

469
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:11,519
Yeah. Well, uh...

470
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,919
So, uh, what you up to?

471
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:17,119
You realize that's light-years away
from being any of your business, right?

472
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,755
Hey, well, just asking,
you know.

473
00:31:20,390 --> 00:31:22,719
So, is Dan, uh, a lawyer?

474
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,689
No, he's a doctor.

475
00:31:24,690 --> 00:31:27,325
- Surgeon, actually.
- Oh.

476
00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:29,719
How's Mr. Belvedere, anyway?

477
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,149
I would say
that he misses you,

478
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:32,919
but that would be bullshit,
'cause...

479
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,619
- He's a cat.
- No, because he never liked you.

480
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:36,019
No, he's a cat,
and cats don't like anyone.

481
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:38,389
You look good, by the way.
You doing good?

482
00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:39,589
What are you
doing here, Eddie?

483
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:41,255
I'm here 'cause I miss you.

484
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:43,649
A lot.

485
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:45,049
You know, we were gonna
get married.

486
00:31:45,050 --> 00:31:47,619
That wasn't so long ago,
and now, you know...

487
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:50,125
I can't really believe
that we're not...

488
00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:54,525
Are we gonna try
and find our way back?

489
00:31:54,890 --> 00:31:57,025
No, we can't.

490
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,155
You did this, Eddie.

491
00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:05,119
Not Carlton Drake,
not the network.

492
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,795
You.

493
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,889
<i>Uh, hello.
This is Dr. Skirth.</i>

494
00:33:14,890 --> 00:33:16,895
Yes, Eddie Brock here.

495
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:19,725
Talk to me.

496
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:25,219
Are you sure
this is gonna work?

497
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:27,165
Just stay down
and shut up, please.

498
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:32,025
<i>53.5,
win-909 RPM.</i>

499
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:38,489
Whew.

500
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:41,059
<i>Overpopulation
and climate change.</i>

501
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:43,189
These are two things
that Drake cannot control.

502
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:45,159
Yeah, got it, right.

503
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:48,189
We are literally a generation
away from an uninhabitable Earth.

504
00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:51,019
- Uh, yeah.
- Drake is using his personal rockets

505
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:53,119
to scout real estate.

506
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,989
You know, it's a really
interesting story,

507
00:33:54,990 --> 00:33:57,129
but we need to just get to the
part where he's killing people.

508
00:33:57,130 --> 00:34:00,189
Drake sent a ship
on a recon mission.

509
00:34:00,190 --> 00:34:03,029
On the way back,
they found a comet.

510
00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:05,329
A comet?

511
00:34:05,330 --> 00:34:08,389
Onboard computers indicated the presence
of life, of millions of organisms.

512
00:34:08,390 --> 00:34:10,329
Wait, wait, wait, when you
say "millions of organisms,"

513
00:34:10,330 --> 00:34:12,129
- what do you mean?
- We brought back some specimens.

514
00:34:12,130 --> 00:34:13,789
You're talking about aliens?

515
00:34:13,790 --> 00:34:16,189
Like, aliens?

516
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:17,559

517
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:19,289
Aliens, yeah.

518
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:21,829
Yes.

519
00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:23,635
But we don't
call them that.

520
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:26,889
- We call them Symbiotes.
- Symbiotes?

521
00:34:26,890 --> 00:34:29,559
And they cannot survive in
our environment without help.

522
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:34,029
Drake believes that the union
between human and Symbiote

523
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:36,889
is the key to our survival,
but not here on Earth.

524
00:34:36,890 --> 00:34:41,359
Drake is trying to put human
beings and aliens together?

525
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,859
So they can live in space?

526
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:44,289
We call them hosts.

527
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:47,089
That's nuts, isn't it?
That's completely insane.

528
00:34:47,090 --> 00:34:49,189
Yes. There's no protocol
for this thing.

529
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:50,459
He's just feeding them in.

530
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:52,429

Oh, I got a bunch of

00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:18,545
Well, we assume
the intruder took it.

580

581
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:25,739
We don't know what happened.

who was on duty last night.

583
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:28,839
- Already did, sir.
- But I didn't.

584
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:30,669
Get it out of my sight.

585
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:32,799
- Carlton, you need to see this.
- What now?

586
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,669
His blood
pressure's back to normal.

587
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:37,045
Liver functions, too.

588
00:40:38,870 --> 00:40:40,739
I knew it.

589
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:43,345
See, his body just needed
time to adjust.

590
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:47,739
I don't want to waste any more time.
I want to up the tests.

591
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:49,705
- Okay?
- Yeah.

592
00:40:51,370 --> 00:40:53,075

00:45:15,350 --> 00:45:17,479
- Oh, boy.
- Hey, Mrs. Manfredi. How are you?

688
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:19,049
Oh, I just saw Morris.

689
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:22,379
And he's whining and complaining
like an old baby again.

690
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:24,309
- Oh, good.
- Oh, thank you so much.

691
00:45:24,310 --> 00:45:26,679
Yeah, my pleasure.

692
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:28,379
Okay, Mrs. Manfredi,
we talked about the dog.

693
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:29,979
Okay, love the dog.
You can't have the dog.

694
00:45:29,980 --> 00:45:32,049
Sorry. Gemini.

695
00:45:32,050 --> 00:45:33,679
We're gonna get to the bottom of this.
All right? That I can promise you.

696
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:35,109
- But for now, go home, get some rest.
- Uh-huh.

697
00:45:35,110 --> 00:45:36,679
I'll call you when
your tests are in.

698
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:38,009
- All right, thank you.
- Okay? Yep.

699
00:45:38,010 --> 00:45:39,755
- Thank you, Dan. Thank you.
- You got it.

700
00:45:41,750 --> 00:45:43,149
- Hello, Doctor.
- Hi.

701
00:45:43,150 --> 00:45:44,379
Did you have
the same reactions

702
00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:46,655
regardless
of the temperature...

703
00:45:48,950 --> 00:45:51,255
Good afternoon,
Dr. Skirth.

704
00:45:55,850 --> 00:45:57,979
The creature
and the host are one.

705
00:45:57,980 --> 00:45:59,649
Everything was fine.

706
00:45:59,650 --> 00:46:02,249
So, why does the human
continue to waste away?

707
00:46:02,250 --> 00:46:05,249
I don't know. We've given him enough
liquid nutrition to feed an elephant.

708
00:46:05,250 --> 00:46:06,779
But the organism
is unaffected?

709
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:08,149
- The Symbiote is thriving.
- Good.

710
00:46:08,150 --> 00:46:10,349
But once again,
it's killing the host.

711
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:11,985
It's consuming his organs.

712
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:14,655
Oh, watch this.

713
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:20,655
Whoa, whoa, what are you doing?
You're hurting it. Stop it!

714
00:46:21,950 --> 00:46:24,949
Sounds in the 4,000 to 6,000 hertz
range are very harmful for it.

715
00:46:24,950 --> 00:46:27,985
- Well, then don't make those sounds.
- Okay.

716
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:30,679
He was stabilizing.
What happened?

717
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:32,425
He's approaching
acute liver failure.

718
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:34,919
We're gonna need another host.

719
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:36,949
Such poor design.

720
00:46:36,950 --> 00:46:39,779
- Excuse me?
- Human beings.

721
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:41,655
Sorry to interrupt.

722
00:46:43,820 --> 00:46:45,649
Thought you'd like
some good news.

723
00:46:45,650 --> 00:46:47,955
I'm sorry.

724
00:46:58,080 --> 00:46:59,649
<i>Hungry!</i>

725
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:01,819
Oh, goddamn.

726
00:47:01,820 --> 00:47:03,719
I'm okay.
Don't worry about me.

727
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:05,919
Can I get through, please?
Excuse me.

728
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:07,219
Thank you.

729
00:47:07,220 --> 00:47:08,779
I'm just gonna stay here,
all right?

730
00:47:08,780 --> 00:47:11,955
Until the cable car stops.

731
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:18,379
We're good.
All right. Thank you.

732
00:47:18,380 --> 00:47:20,985
Excuse me.

733
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:26,779
Oh, hey, Anne.

734
00:47:26,780 --> 00:47:29,749
Eddie, hi. How you feeling?

735
00:47:29,750 --> 00:47:31,649
Oh, feeling... I'm sick.

736
00:47:31,650 --> 00:47:34,749
Well, Eddie,
you have a parasite.

737
00:47:34,750 --> 00:47:36,619
They're not exactly sure
how you got it,

738
00:47:36,620 --> 00:47:38,349
but it would
explain the fever.

739
00:47:38,350 --> 00:47:39,949
<i>That would make sense.</i>

740
00:47:39,950 --> 00:47:43,819
Also, I'm hearing,
uh, a voice.

741
00:47:43,820 --> 00:47:45,719
<i>Auditory hallucinations
are actually very common.</i>

742
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:47,089
Oh, hey, Dan.
How you doing?

743
00:47:47,090 --> 00:47:48,719
<i>I didn't realize that
you were on the call, too.</i>

744
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:50,949
- Yeah, I'm here.
- Mmm.

745
00:47:50,950 --> 00:47:52,849
Hey, Dan,
would this parasite...

746
00:47:52,850 --> 00:47:54,779
Would it, like, be able to
make me, I don't know...

747
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:57,919
Like, climb a really, really,
really tall tree,

748
00:47:57,920 --> 00:47:59,949
but super, super fast?

749
00:47:59,950 --> 00:48:01,719
<i>Yes. We just did.</i>

750
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:03,089
<i>Uh, well, Eddie,
it sounds like</i>

751
00:48:03,090 --> 00:48:04,949
it might be causing
some metabolic abnormalities

752
00:48:04,950 --> 00:48:07,119
that are making it hard for your
body to maintain homeostasis.

753
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:10,019
You said "causing" and "body,"
and... I lost you.

754
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:11,989
Listen, Eddie, um, we are
gonna get you on some meds,

755
00:48:11,990 --> 00:48:13,319
and we are gonna
clear that out.

756
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:14,889
- Yes.
- <i>Never gonna happen.</i>

757
00:48:14,890 --> 00:48:17,619
Will you stop doing that now.
Not now.

758
00:48:17,620 --> 00:48:19,289
- Eddie, we're just trying to help you.
- <i>I know.</i>

759
00:48:19,290 --> 00:48:21,819
I know. I'm just, I'm not
actually talking to you, Annie.

760
00:48:21,820 --> 00:48:23,289
Who are you talking to?

761
00:48:23,290 --> 00:48:25,189
I'm just gonna call you back,
all right?

762
00:48:25,190 --> 00:48:28,685
Thank you. Thank you, Dan.
Thank you. Thank you, both.

763
00:48:43,350 --> 00:48:44,819
Yeah?

764
00:48:44,820 --> 00:48:46,619
Hey, can you turn
your music down, please?

765
00:48:46,620 --> 00:48:48,349
'Cause I'm having
a really hard time.

766
00:48:48,350 --> 00:48:50,455
Whatever.

767
00:48:52,790 --> 00:48:54,789
Yeah, sure, man. Yeah.

768
00:48:54,790 --> 00:48:56,595
- I'll just turn it right down. Sorry.
- Thank you. Thank you.

769
00:48:59,220 --> 00:49:02,325
I was troubled by

770
00:49:02,750 --> 00:49:04,359
what we've been doing.

771
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:08,025
I get it.

772
00:49:08,690 --> 00:49:10,119
We've all been troubled.

773
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:13,295
It's the nature
of what we do.

774
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:17,995
But I need you to tell me
who was here with you.

775
00:49:19,090 --> 00:49:20,995
I need that from you.

776
00:49:23,390 --> 00:49:25,919
I can't do that.

777
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:29,965
We can't fix things
unless we begin with

778
00:49:30,220 --> 00:49:32,255
your friend.

779
00:49:32,990 --> 00:49:34,719
The person who was here.

780
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:36,625
Because they're gonna die.
They're in grave danger.

781
00:49:37,020 --> 00:49:39,259
You know that, right?

782
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:41,749
They're gonna die unless
we bring them back here,

783
00:49:41,750 --> 00:49:44,625
where you can help
to keep them alive.

784
00:49:47,050 --> 00:49:49,295
Hey. Dora.

785
00:49:50,290 --> 00:49:53,765
I promise, from here on in,
we will do things differently.

786
00:49:56,390 --> 00:49:58,295
Will you trust me?

787
00:50:04,660 --> 00:50:06,219
Eddie Brock.

788
00:50:06,220 --> 00:50:07,995
- Eddie Brock?
- Mmm-hmm.

789
00:50:17,020 --> 00:50:19,319
You were our best.

790
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:21,655
Open it.

791
00:50:25,190 --> 00:50:26,389
No! No!

792
00:50:26,390 --> 00:50:28,995
No! No! No!

793
00:50:33,220 --> 00:50:35,595
<i>Do not open that door.</i>

794
00:50:36,620 --> 00:50:38,425
Huh?

795
00:50:50,290 --> 00:50:52,359
Stay put.

796
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:54,619
- Hey, Eddie.
- <i>Who the hell is this guy?</i>

797
00:50:54,620 --> 00:50:57,089
I'm gonna need
Mr. Drake's property back.

798
00:50:57,090 --> 00:50:58,759
Whoa.

799
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:01,519
- <i>What are you doing?</i>
- I'm, uh...

800
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:03,219
I'm putting my hands up.

801
00:51:03,220 --> 00:51:05,519
<i>You are making us
look bad.</i>

802
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:08,489
I...
No, I am not.

803
00:51:08,490 --> 00:51:10,029
<i>Yes, you are.</i>

804
00:51:10,030 --> 00:51:11,419
- No, I'm not.
- <i>Yes, you are!</i>

805
00:51:11,420 --> 00:51:13,129
- No, I'm not.
- <i>Why would you do that?</i>

806
00:51:13,130 --> 00:51:15,119
'Cause it is
a very sensible thing to do.

807
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:17,319
- Eddie...
- <i>I will take care of this myself.</i>

808
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:19,825
- What?
- Eddie, where's the bug?

809
00:51:21,030 --> 00:51:22,425
Take him down.

810
00:51:33,190 --> 00:51:35,195
I'm so sorry
about your friends.

811
00:51:43,130 --> 00:51:46,395
- What is that?
- <i>Not "what." Who.</i>

812
00:51:47,490 --> 00:51:49,235
Oh.

813
00:51:58,130 --> 00:51:59,735
Shit.

814
00:52:21,030 --> 00:52:23,359
<i>Outstanding.</i>

815
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:25,389
<i>Now let's bite all their heads off
and pile them up in the corner.</i>

816
00:52:25,390 --> 00:52:26,489
Why would we do that?

817
00:52:26,490 --> 00:52:29,895
<i>Pile of bodies, pile of heads.</i>

818
00:52:36,530 --> 00:52:38,735
What the shit, man?

819
00:52:43,790 --> 00:52:46,335
No! No, no, no!

820
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:54,529
- What the hell?
- Dude! How did you do that?

821
00:52:54,530 --> 00:52:57,395
Apparently, I have a parasite.

822
00:53:05,460 --> 00:53:08,029
Mr. Drake, our subject
is carrying the Symbiote.

823
00:53:08,030 --> 00:53:10,065
<i>Connecting you
to the feed now.</i>

824
00:53:14,630 --> 00:53:16,329
He's achieved symbiosis.

825
00:53:16,330 --> 00:53:17,759
Are you seeing this?

826
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:20,365
Are you seeing this?
He's achieved symbiosis!

827
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:22,759
Treece...

828
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:25,365
Treece, bring me back
my creature.

829
00:53:33,230 --> 00:53:35,065
<i>Eddie.</i>

830
00:53:44,130 --> 00:53:46,499
You're not even here, are you?
I'm just seeing things.

831
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:48,599
It's not real.
You're in my head.

832
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:50,159
'Cause you're just a parasite.

833
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:51,805
"Parasite"?

834
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:01,065
You have a brain tumor, Eddie.

835
00:54:04,300 --> 00:54:06,429
I got him. He's in the alley
behind the Schueller Building.

836
00:54:06,430 --> 00:54:08,229
I am sorry that I
called you a parasite.

837
00:54:08,230 --> 00:54:10,629
We can discuss this
like two men.

838
00:54:10,630 --> 00:54:12,735
What is that? What is that?

839
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:22,629
What?

840
00:54:22,630 --> 00:54:25,099
Do not let him get away.
Do you understand me, Treece?

841
00:54:25,100 --> 00:54:27,629
<i>Copy.
Weapons are armed and ready.</i>

842
00:54:27,630 --> 00:54:29,335
Launch the drones.

843
00:54:58,060 --> 00:55:00,805
<i>Duck.</i>

844
00:55:01,570 --> 00:55:03,199
Whew!

845
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:05,705
- Thank you.
- <i>You are welcome.</i>

846
00:55:11,130 --> 00:55:13,905
Oh!

847
00:55:21,430 --> 00:55:24,405
This is beyond
anything we thought was possible.

848
00:55:30,630 --> 00:55:32,975
Oh, God, no!

849
00:55:54,570 --> 00:55:56,965
Holy shit!

850
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:05,629
Treece, do not
let him get away.

851
00:56:05,630 --> 00:56:08,705
I've got him.
All ground vehicles, move in.

852
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:16,935
Target is now eastbound
on Grant.

853
00:56:17,630 --> 00:56:19,735
Oh, God! Do something!

854
00:56:26,670 --> 00:56:28,275
What the...

855
00:56:34,340 --> 00:56:37,245
Oh, yeah! We got more friends.
Awesome.

856
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:42,405
No, no, no! No, no!

857
00:56:45,170 --> 00:56:46,775
No! You're out of your mind!

858
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:51,175
No!

859
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:12,975
- That is a dead-end!
- <i>Not for us.</i>

860
00:57:14,070 --> 00:57:16,775
Whoa!

861
00:57:22,340 --> 00:57:23,945
Yeah!

862
00:57:53,270 --> 00:57:55,045
Whoa!

863
00:58:01,270 --> 00:58:02,699
I am going to die!

864
00:58:02,700 --> 00:58:04,745
<i>You are not
going to die!</i>

865
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:19,115
Whoa! That was pretty cool,
actually. I'm not gonna lie...

866
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:29,309
I got him.

867
00:58:29,310 --> 00:58:30,369
- <i>Bring him home.</i>
- Copy that.

868
00:58:30,370 --> 00:58:32,915
This is incredible.

869
00:58:38,610 --> 00:58:41,509
You have been a serious
pain in the ass for me, Eddie.

870
00:58:41,510 --> 00:58:45,145
Well, you know,
I aim to please.

871
00:58:56,340 --> 00:59:00,309
Eyes, lungs, pancreas.

872
00:59:00,310 --> 00:59:03,375
So many snacks,
so little time.

873
00:59:13,410 --> 00:59:15,339
SFPD. Don't move!

874
00:59:15,340 --> 00:59:17,115
Get off the car!

875
00:59:33,270 --> 00:59:34,915
My legs.

876
00:59:36,580 --> 00:59:38,439
Oh, my God,
my legs were broken.

877
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:41,445
Now they're not broken.
What is happening?

878
00:59:56,170 --> 00:59:58,109
What the hell
are you?

879
00:59:58,110 --> 01:00:00,579
I am Venom.

880
01:00:00,580 --> 01:00:03,339
And you are mine.

881
01:00:03,340 --> 01:00:05,709
You bit somebody's head off.

882
01:00:05,710 --> 01:00:07,779
Fuel in the tank.

883
01:00:07,780 --> 01:00:10,039
Listen carefully, Eddie.

884
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:12,279
You did not find us.

885
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:15,079
We found you.

886
01:00:15,080 --> 01:00:17,109
Think of yourself
as my ride.

887
01:00:17,110 --> 01:00:18,379
Where are you going?

888
01:00:18,380 --> 01:00:21,479
We need
Carlton Drake's rocket.

889
01:00:21,480 --> 01:00:23,439
You remember him.

890
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:24,839
How do you even know
about that?

891
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:27,339
- I know everything, Eddie.
- You do?

892
01:00:27,340 --> 01:00:29,179
- Everything about you.
- How?

893
01:00:29,180 --> 01:00:31,609
I am inside your head.

894
01:00:31,610 --> 01:00:34,775
You are a loser, Eddie.

895
01:00:38,740 --> 01:00:41,509
Are you gonna eat
anybody else?

896
01:00:41,510 --> 01:00:42,809
Most likely.

897
01:00:42,810 --> 01:00:44,279
Oh, God.

898
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:47,279
That is why we are here.

899
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:51,185
Cooperate,
and you might just survive.

900
01:00:51,740 --> 01:00:54,445
That is the deal.

901
01:00:57,340 --> 01:00:58,679
<i>Good
evening, ladies and gentlemen.</i>

902
01:00:58,680 --> 01:01:00,579
<i>Welcome to San Francisco.</i>

903
01:01:00,580 --> 01:01:03,085
<i>For your safety and comfort,
please remain seated...</i>

904
01:01:23,510 --> 01:01:25,279
Hey, babe. I'm almost home.

905
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:27,109
- <i>Where's Eddie?</i>
- Why? What's happening?

906
01:01:27,110 --> 01:01:29,785
I got Eddie's labs back,

907
01:01:30,580 --> 01:01:32,509
and it's worse than I thought.

908
01:01:32,510 --> 01:01:35,679
His systems, renal, endocrine,
they're behaving abnormally.

909
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:37,409
<i>I've never seen
anything like it.</i>

910
01:01:37,410 --> 01:01:39,209
What does that mean, Dan?
What are you telling me?

911
01:01:39,210 --> 01:01:41,445
- You need to get him here.
- <i>My God.</i>

912
01:01:44,810 --> 01:01:47,245
- <i>Eddie Brock here. Leave a message.</i>
- Shit.

913
01:01:53,180 --> 01:01:56,509
Where were you when
it left Dr. Skirth's body?

914
01:01:56,510 --> 01:01:58,679
- Where was he?
- I was...

915
01:01:58,680 --> 01:02:03,285
This is the higher life-form. You
stood by and watched while it died.

916
01:02:03,710 --> 01:02:05,355
The arrogance.

917
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:14,709
Treece, listen to me. After this,
we can't risk killing Brock,

918
01:02:14,710 --> 01:02:17,079
not until we find
another suitable host.

919
01:02:17,080 --> 01:02:22,085
I don't want to see you again
unless you have Brock!

920
01:02:26,680 --> 01:02:28,979
Officer, what's happening?
I need to get in there.

921
01:02:28,980 --> 01:02:31,079
- It's my friend's apartment.
- Building's been evacuated.

922
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:32,149
It's not safe for you
to be here, ma'am.

923
01:02:32,150 --> 01:02:34,079
Found another one, Bill.

924
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:35,979
Get off the streets.
Go home.

925
01:02:35,980 --> 01:02:37,679
There's bodies
all over the city tonight.

926
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:39,315
Bodies?

927
01:02:40,150 --> 01:02:42,715
My God, Eddie,
where are you?

928
01:02:45,110 --> 01:02:47,079
<i>Who is Anne?
Your pulse has quickened.</i>

929
01:02:47,080 --> 01:02:49,009
That is none of your
goddamn business.

930
01:02:49,010 --> 01:02:51,579
<i>Everything of yours
is my business, Eddie.</i>

931
01:02:51,580 --> 01:02:53,149
<i>We have no secrets.</i>

932
01:02:53,150 --> 01:02:54,779
Yeah? Well, then you know
exactly why I'm going here

933
01:02:54,780 --> 01:02:56,279
before we get to your rocket,
huh?

934
01:02:56,280 --> 01:02:59,809
<i>Sure.
I'm not unreasonable.</i>

935
01:02:59,810 --> 01:03:01,609
Shit. Yeah?

936
01:03:01,610 --> 01:03:03,579
Eddie. Thank God. Where are you?
I need to see you.

937
01:03:03,580 --> 01:03:05,309
No, no, you can't see me.

938
01:03:05,310 --> 01:03:07,609
Eddie, I need you to tell me where you are.
I'm coming to get you.

939
01:03:07,610 --> 01:03:09,179
No, you cannot come
anywhere near me.

940
01:03:09,180 --> 01:03:11,749
You cannot come
near me right now.

941
01:03:11,750 --> 01:03:13,549
- Richard. Hey, Richard...
- <i>No!</i>

942
01:03:13,550 --> 01:03:15,049
- Eddie?
- <i>No, I gotta go up there.</i>

943
01:03:15,050 --> 01:03:16,079
You know you're not
supposed to be here, Eddie.

944
01:03:16,080 --> 01:03:17,579
I got to get up there, man.

945
01:03:17,580 --> 01:03:19,649
Look, I got love for you, bro,
but no can do.

946
01:03:19,650 --> 01:03:21,019
There's no such thing
as can't.

947
01:03:21,020 --> 01:03:22,785
I'm sorry, man.

948
01:03:23,110 --> 01:03:25,609
Okay, okay... Uh...

949
01:03:25,610 --> 01:03:27,919
Can you, uh,
just give him this?

950
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:30,849
- He needs to see what's on it.
- Eddie, please. I really need this job.

951
01:03:30,850 --> 01:03:33,149
- <i>Let's eat his brains.</i>
- No! You do not touch him!

952
01:03:33,150 --> 01:03:35,149
- He is my friend.
- What's wrong with you?

953
01:03:35,150 --> 01:03:37,219
He works three jobs just so
that he can support his family.

954
01:03:37,220 --> 01:03:38,709
- Eddie, what's going on?
- We're leaving.

955
01:03:38,710 --> 01:03:40,249
- <i>"We"?</i>
- Yeah.

956
01:03:40,250 --> 01:03:42,425
- What are you talking about, "we"?
- Just stay back!

957
01:03:44,020 --> 01:03:46,455
Yeah.

958
01:03:51,710 --> 01:03:54,755
- Shit.
- <i>You want up?</i>

959
01:03:57,920 --> 01:04:00,855
<i>Well, why didn't you just say?</i>

960
01:04:11,050 --> 01:04:13,579
Hmm.

961
01:04:13,580 --> 01:04:16,779
- It is peaceful up here.
- <i>I'm not very good with heights.</i>

962
01:04:16,780 --> 01:04:20,979
Your world is not so ugly
after all.

963
01:04:20,980 --> 01:04:23,549
I'm almost sorry
to see it end.

964
01:04:23,550 --> 01:04:25,315
<i>What does that mean?</i>

965
01:04:32,980 --> 01:04:35,285
Where'd you go?
Where did you go?

966
01:04:45,580 --> 01:04:46,979
<i>I got us.</i>

967
01:04:46,980 --> 01:04:48,685
Whoa.

968
01:04:53,550 --> 01:04:57,119
Again?
You're gonna get me killed.

969
01:04:57,120 --> 01:04:59,249
<i>You die, I die.</i>

970
01:04:59,250 --> 01:05:01,649
Yeah, well, you can always
just shed my carcass

971
01:05:01,650 --> 01:05:04,149
and exchange it for another
one whenever you need.

972
01:05:04,150 --> 01:05:06,049
<i>Why would I do that?</i>

973
01:05:06,050 --> 01:05:09,049
<i>You are far too good of a
match to throw away so soon.</i>

974
01:05:09,050 --> 01:05:11,219
<i>Plus, I am starting
to like you.</i>

975
01:05:11,220 --> 01:05:13,285
<i>You and I
are not so different.</i>

976
01:05:13,290 --> 01:05:14,955
Thank you.

977
01:05:18,220 --> 01:05:19,855
Okay.

978
01:05:21,220 --> 01:05:23,325
Here's your evidence.

979
01:05:26,650 --> 01:05:28,455
<i>Jump.</i>

980
01:05:30,650 --> 01:05:32,625
<i>Pussy.</i>

981
01:05:42,120 --> 01:05:43,855
Hands!

982
01:05:45,190 --> 01:05:47,525
On the ground! Now!

983
01:05:51,320 --> 01:05:54,149
Guys, you do not want to do this.
Trust me.

984
01:05:54,150 --> 01:05:56,219
- Mask!
- Copy!

985
01:05:56,220 --> 01:05:58,719
All right,
have it your own way.

986
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:00,589
- Mask!
- <i>Copy.</i>

987
01:06:00,590 --> 01:06:02,725
What the hell
is that thing?

988
01:06:07,720 --> 01:06:09,495
What the hell?

989
01:06:10,120 --> 01:06:11,719
Hold your fire!

990
01:06:11,720 --> 01:06:13,849
Flares!

991
01:06:13,850 --> 01:06:14,949
He's there!
He's there!

992
01:06:14,950 --> 01:06:16,755
Reload!

993
01:06:17,250 --> 01:06:19,585
Anybody see him?

994
01:06:29,890 --> 01:06:32,425
Does anyone have eyes on him?

995
01:06:33,550 --> 01:06:36,255
<i>Switching to
thermal. Seeking target.</i>

996
01:06:49,250 --> 01:06:51,595
I don't have
eyes on him.

997
01:06:52,690 --> 01:06:54,355
Where is it?

998
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:02,455
Flash grenade!

999
01:07:03,120 --> 01:07:04,259
Throw them!

1000
01:07:04,260 --> 01:07:06,395
Flash grenade!

1001
01:07:16,820 --> 01:07:18,089
He's in the rafters!

1002
01:07:18,090 --> 01:07:19,755
Above!

1003
01:07:24,590 --> 01:07:26,225
There he is!

1004
01:07:30,260 --> 01:07:32,295
Move, move, move!

1005
01:08:01,620 --> 01:08:03,925
<i>No! We do not
eat policemen!</i>

1006
01:08:09,690 --> 01:08:11,189
Annie! Annie, wait!

1007
01:08:11,190 --> 01:08:13,019
- Wait, please.
- Oh, what the hell is that?

1008
01:08:13,020 --> 01:08:15,689
That's not me.
I've been infected.

1009
01:08:15,690 --> 01:08:18,159
- Eddie, what's happening?
- He's inside me.

1010
01:08:18,160 --> 01:08:19,759
- "He"?
- Yes.

1011
01:08:19,760 --> 01:08:22,189
- I know it sounds crazy, but...
- You're sick.

1012
01:08:22,190 --> 01:08:25,495
- Eddie, you're really sick.
- No, I am scared!

1013
01:08:27,260 --> 01:08:30,565
- And I need help.
- Hospital.

1014
01:08:33,720 --> 01:08:35,325
Right now.

1015
01:08:38,530 --> 01:08:41,319
I can't go with you.
It's not safe.

1016
01:08:41,320 --> 01:08:42,995
Get in the car, Eddie.

1017
01:08:44,490 --> 01:08:48,165
- In the back.
- <i>I like her. Get in.</i>

1018
01:08:54,630 --> 01:08:57,335
I'm out of control.

1019
01:08:58,390 --> 01:08:59,889
Dan just needs to do
another MRI.

1020
01:08:59,890 --> 01:09:02,335
- <i>No MRI.</i>
- No. No. No MRI.

1021
01:09:02,430 --> 01:09:04,159
What? Why?

1022
01:09:04,160 --> 01:09:06,865
<i>Sound at 4,000
to 6,000 hertz is lethal.</i>

1023
01:09:07,830 --> 01:09:11,589
Sound frequency in the MRI
is really harmful for him.

1024
01:09:11,590 --> 01:09:14,389
What, so, sound
is like his kryptonite?

1025
01:09:14,390 --> 01:09:17,189
- Not all sounds.
- <i>And fire.</i>

1026
01:09:17,190 --> 01:09:20,835
Fire. And fire.
He's talking to you?

1027
01:09:21,830 --> 01:09:23,865
Always.

1028
01:09:24,360 --> 01:09:26,529
- Are you in pain?
- No.

1029
01:09:26,530 --> 01:09:29,229
No, I don't feel anything,
actually, apart from...

1030
01:09:29,230 --> 01:09:31,529
I'm hungry all the time.

1031
01:09:31,530 --> 01:09:35,465
<i>And you feel sad, do you
not, Eddie, when you are with her?</i>

1032
01:09:36,160 --> 01:09:37,859
Get out of my head, man.

1033
01:09:37,860 --> 01:09:40,329
<i>You never apologized.</i>

1034
01:09:40,330 --> 01:09:43,535
<i>You might not live
to get another chance.</i>

1035
01:09:48,790 --> 01:09:50,629
Annie.

1036
01:09:50,630 --> 01:09:54,289
I just want to say
that whatever happens,

1037
01:09:54,290 --> 01:10:00,289
that I am truly sorry for whatever...
And everything I have ever done to you.

1038
01:10:00,290 --> 01:10:02,495
I am truly, truly sorry.

1039
01:10:03,290 --> 01:10:05,929
And that I love you.

1040
01:10:05,930 --> 01:10:08,559
Oh, Eddie...

1041
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:11,659
Now's really not the time. Let's
just keep you alive, okay?

1042
01:10:11,660 --> 01:10:14,895
<i>Aw, that's nice.</i>

1043
01:10:17,490 --> 01:10:22,389
You know, I'm really wet and
cold. Can I, uh, wear this?

1044
01:10:22,390 --> 01:10:25,589
Yeah, yeah, you can wear
whatever you want.

1045
01:10:25,590 --> 01:10:27,265
Thank you.

1046
01:10:45,260 --> 01:10:46,905
Hello?

1047
01:10:57,500 --> 01:10:59,435
What are you doing here?

1048
01:11:02,530 --> 01:11:04,135
Are you lost?

1049
01:11:05,700 --> 01:11:08,305
I'm not lost.

1050
01:11:15,260 --> 01:11:16,759
Thanks for coming in.

1051
01:11:16,760 --> 01:11:20,259
- Eddie, I'm sorry.
- What?

1052
01:11:20,260 --> 01:11:23,159
Eddie, I got your labs back, and
your heart has atrophied severely.

1053
01:11:23,160 --> 01:11:25,659
<i>Do not listen to him.
I can fix it.</i>

1054
01:11:25,660 --> 01:11:27,199
I don't want you to fix it.

1055
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:29,135
<i>I can heal you.</i>

1056
01:11:30,730 --> 01:11:32,429
Can you fix it?

1057
01:11:32,430 --> 01:11:34,359
No. I've never seen
anything like this before.

1058
01:11:34,360 --> 01:11:36,559
- This parasite, whatever this is...
- <i>"Parasite"?</i>

1059
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:37,859
It's eating you
from the inside.

1060
01:11:37,860 --> 01:11:39,499
Not a parasite.
He's not.

1061
01:11:39,500 --> 01:11:41,599
- You're using him up.
- <i>No. She is wrong.</i>

1062
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:44,629
- We need to get you to the ICU.
- Wait. Shh!

1063
01:11:44,630 --> 01:11:47,229
- I, Eddie, am I dying?
- <i>No!</i>

1064
01:11:47,230 --> 01:11:48,829
You're killing him.

1065
01:11:48,830 --> 01:11:50,299
<i>They do not know
what they are talking about.</i>

1066
01:11:50,300 --> 01:11:51,859
Listen,
we don't have a lot of time...

1067
01:11:51,860 --> 01:11:54,005
- Oh, God!
- <i>We have to get out of here.</i>

1068
01:11:54,730 --> 01:11:55,799
- Stop!
- Oh, God, he's killing you.

1069
01:11:55,800 --> 01:11:57,535
I'm killing you.
I'm so sorry.

1070
01:11:59,500 --> 01:12:03,105
No! Don't do that!

1071
01:12:17,670 --> 01:12:20,699
Are you all right? Eddie, I'm sorry.
I had to get him out of you.

1072
01:12:20,700 --> 01:12:22,575
What is that?

1073
01:12:28,930 --> 01:12:31,899
You were killing me?

1074
01:12:31,900 --> 01:12:35,575
What happened to "we," man?
What happened to "we"?

1075
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:42,075
Yeah, look at you now, huh?
Now you're dying, too.

1076
01:12:42,700 --> 01:12:44,435
We're done.

1077
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:48,569
- Where do you think you're going?
- Anywhere other than here.

1078
01:12:48,570 --> 01:12:50,329
You don't think we have
a little problem on our hands?

1079
01:12:50,330 --> 01:12:52,935
Wait, you're not gonna
leave me here with this thing.

1080
01:12:55,270 --> 01:12:56,799
You want to tell me
what the hell's going on?

1081
01:12:56,800 --> 01:13:00,699
I do. And you're right.
We do need to talk about it,

1082
01:13:00,700 --> 01:13:02,929
but I don't know
much more than you do.

1083
01:13:02,930 --> 01:13:05,899
I guess he had
no one else to turn to.

1084
01:13:05,900 --> 01:13:09,629
He's a very complicated man.
But, Dan, I promise,

1085
01:13:09,630 --> 01:13:11,369
there's nothing going on
between me and Eddie.

1086
01:13:11,370 --> 01:13:13,499
I'm not talking
about you and Eddie, Anne.

1087
01:13:13,500 --> 01:13:15,375
- Oh.
- I'm talking about that.

1088
01:13:18,570 --> 01:13:20,175
Dan.

1089
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:28,235
Where is it?

1090
01:13:53,540 --> 01:13:56,145
Eddie, Eddie, Eddie.

1091
01:14:21,640 --> 01:14:25,329
You can kill me,
'cause I'm dying anyway.

1092
01:14:25,330 --> 01:14:29,939
I'm not just gonna kill you.
That wouldn't be any fun.

1093
01:14:29,940 --> 01:14:34,199
No, no, no. I'm gonna rip your
tongue out of your face.

1094
01:14:34,200 --> 01:14:37,105
Whoo!

1095
01:14:38,170 --> 01:14:42,445
Stop. You're bleeding
all over my lab. Go. Go!

1096
01:14:51,400 --> 01:14:53,469
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

1097
01:14:53,470 --> 01:14:56,499
And you know what? Even if I
did, I wouldn't tell you anyway.

1098
01:14:56,500 --> 01:15:00,399
I don't trust you,
and you're insane.

1099
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:02,339
- That hurts.
- Sorry.

1100
01:15:02,340 --> 01:15:03,799
Long journal entry
about that tonight.

1101
01:15:03,800 --> 01:15:05,569
You're being dumb, Brock.
I'm not insane.

1102
01:15:05,570 --> 01:15:08,739
What's insane is the way
humans choose to live today.

1103
01:15:08,740 --> 01:15:11,299
Think about it.
All we do is take, take, take.

1104
01:15:11,300 --> 01:15:12,739
It can't go on.

1105
01:15:12,740 --> 01:15:15,269
We've brought the planet
to the brink of extinction.

1106
01:15:15,270 --> 01:15:17,269
We're parasites.
You're a good example.

1107
01:15:17,270 --> 01:15:19,169
Think about it.
All you do is take.

1108
01:15:19,170 --> 01:15:22,869
You took my Symbiote. You
take potshots at a great man

1109
01:15:22,870 --> 01:15:25,275
- trying to get something done.
- Who?

1110
01:15:26,600 --> 01:15:28,869
Didn't you take from the
person you loved the most,

1111
01:15:28,870 --> 01:15:31,369
who trusted you the most?
That's insane.

1112
01:15:31,370 --> 01:15:35,869
What I've initiated is a whole
new world, a new species.

1113
01:15:35,870 --> 01:15:38,299
Man and Symbiote combined.

1114
01:15:38,300 --> 01:15:40,869
Let me tell you something, buddy.
All right? Just man-to-man.

1115
01:15:40,870 --> 01:15:43,939
Because I have spent a significant
amount of time, all right,

1116
01:15:43,940 --> 01:15:47,339
with one of these creatures
up my ass.

1117
01:15:47,340 --> 01:15:48,639
It's not a lot of fun.

1118
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:51,239
And then I find out,
all along,

1119
01:15:51,240 --> 01:15:52,639
that they're killing you.

1120
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:54,369
This is the last time
I'm asking you.

1121
01:15:54,370 --> 01:15:56,909
- Where is my Symbiote?
- I have no idea.

1122
01:15:56,910 --> 01:15:59,439
- Where is he?
- Oh, my God!

1123
01:15:59,440 --> 01:16:01,169
Where's Venom?

1124
01:16:01,170 --> 01:16:05,345
That is the ugliest-looking
thing I have ever seen.

1125
01:16:10,810 --> 01:16:14,609
You know, Brock,
I have no use for you.

1126
01:16:14,610 --> 01:16:17,269
Treece! Come and clean up
your mess.

1127
01:16:17,270 --> 01:16:22,105
Whoa, he has one
up his ass, too.

1128
01:16:29,740 --> 01:16:35,169
Your friends, the others, I apologize.
I tried to keep them alive.

1129
01:16:35,170 --> 01:16:38,569
There are more of us.
Millions more.

1130
01:16:38,570 --> 01:16:41,375
They will follow
wherever I lead.

1131
01:16:42,810 --> 01:16:44,569
Where we lead.

1132
01:16:44,570 --> 01:16:46,309
Yes, "we."

1133
01:16:46,310 --> 01:16:50,175
But first,
we must retrieve them.

1134
01:16:50,940 --> 01:16:53,115
I can take care of that.

1135
01:16:57,540 --> 01:17:00,539
Yeah, what you gonna do,
you gonna walk me to death?

1136
01:17:00,540 --> 01:17:02,145
Shut up.

1137
01:17:05,370 --> 01:17:07,575
Not so tough
without your friend.

1138
01:17:12,670 --> 01:17:14,945
Did your mama not love you?

1139
01:17:17,240 --> 01:17:19,315
God damn it!

1140
01:17:20,570 --> 01:17:23,739
I guess it
pays to be a specialist, huh?

1141
01:17:23,740 --> 01:17:25,739
You know, it doesn't matter
if you kill me anyway,

1142
01:17:25,740 --> 01:17:27,509
because there's something
way bigger afoot

1143
01:17:27,510 --> 01:17:29,175
in this world than you and me.

1144
01:17:29,510 --> 01:17:31,739
Much bigger than me.

1145
01:17:31,740 --> 01:17:36,845
And it's much,
much bigger than you.

1146
01:17:38,610 --> 01:17:40,439
Karma's a bitch.

1147
01:17:40,440 --> 01:17:42,285
I don't believe in karma.

1148
01:17:43,410 --> 01:17:46,015
Oh! Ooh!

1149
01:17:50,110 --> 01:17:51,179
Hi, Eddie.

1150
01:17:51,180 --> 01:17:53,209
Whoa. Whoa...

1151
01:17:53,210 --> 01:17:56,039
Oh...

1152
01:17:56,040 --> 01:17:57,645
Mmm...

1153
01:17:58,080 --> 01:17:59,885
Mmm!

1154
01:18:15,510 --> 01:18:17,285
Oh, no.

1155
01:18:18,280 --> 01:18:20,679
I just bit
that guy's head off.

1156
01:18:20,680 --> 01:18:23,179
I know, I know. I've been there, too.
It's not fun.

1157
01:18:23,180 --> 01:18:26,009
- <i>The one with Drake is Riot.</i>
- Who's Riot?

1158
01:18:26,010 --> 01:18:28,509
<i>Riot is what you would call
a team leader.</i>

1159
01:18:28,510 --> 01:18:30,579
<i>He has an arsenal of weapons.</i>

1160
01:18:30,580 --> 01:18:33,009
- Drake's got his own Symbiote.
- <i>He is unstoppable.</i>

1161
01:18:33,010 --> 01:18:34,579
- Oh, great.
- <i>We have got to go!</i>

1162
01:18:34,580 --> 01:18:36,279
Go where? Where we going?

1163
01:18:36,280 --> 01:18:37,709
- Well, I'm coming with you.
- <i>No!</i>

1164
01:18:37,710 --> 01:18:39,609
<i>It's going to get ugly.</i>

1165
01:18:39,610 --> 01:18:42,315
- Well, she can fight ugly. Trust me.
- Yeah, I can fight ugly.

1166
01:18:43,480 --> 01:18:45,645
Not today.

1167
01:18:46,510 --> 01:18:48,715
Oh, that's bullshit!

1168
01:18:50,280 --> 01:18:52,009
This is not a simulation.

1169
01:18:52,010 --> 01:18:54,179
Well, the flight team
aren't prepped yet.

1170
01:18:54,180 --> 01:18:56,609
I'll be piloting
the spacecraft.

1171
01:18:56,610 --> 01:18:58,339
- You?
- Yes, me.

1172
01:18:58,340 --> 01:19:00,039
How long?

1173
01:19:00,040 --> 01:19:01,739
We're loading the probe
and running diagnostics.

1174
01:19:01,740 --> 01:19:05,715
But even fully automated, you
can't pilot that craft all alone.

1175
01:19:07,350 --> 01:19:09,055
I'm not alone.

1176
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:15,379
God damn it! What the hell
happened there? We just left Annie.

1177
01:19:15,380 --> 01:19:17,349
<i>It is not safe for her.</i>

1178
01:19:17,350 --> 01:19:18,979
<i>If we do not stop Riot,</i>

1179
01:19:18,980 --> 01:19:22,379
<i>he will come back here
with millions more of my kind.</i>

1180
01:19:22,380 --> 01:19:26,749
Millions? What, you were
gonna take the rocket,

1181
01:19:26,750 --> 01:19:29,009
and you were gonna come back
here with an invasion force?

1182
01:19:29,010 --> 01:19:30,709
Then what were you gonna do,
you were gonna go feed

1183
01:19:30,710 --> 01:19:32,479
- on a whole planet?
- <i>Yes!</i>

1184
01:19:32,480 --> 01:19:34,679
<i>But it is
different now, Eddie.</i>

1185
01:19:34,680 --> 01:19:37,249
- <i>I have decided to stay.</i>
- Wow!

1186
01:19:37,250 --> 01:19:40,279
<i>On my planet, I am
kind of a loser, like you.</i>

1187
01:19:40,280 --> 01:19:43,009
- <i>But here, we could be more.</i>
- Excuse me?

1188
01:19:43,010 --> 01:19:44,749
<i>And I'm getting to
like it here.</i>

1189
01:19:44,750 --> 01:19:47,409
Oh, you like us now,
do you, huh?

1190
01:19:47,410 --> 01:19:50,049
<i>However, there will be nothing left to
like if we do not stop that rocket.</i>

1191
01:19:50,050 --> 01:19:54,049
Oh, I see. Right. When it comes
to being completely annihilated,

1192
01:19:54,050 --> 01:19:56,149
- then it's back to "we."
- <i>It is "we."</i>

1193
01:19:56,150 --> 01:19:58,549
<i>Like it or not, it is
going to take both of us.</i>

1194
01:19:58,550 --> 01:20:00,249
Hey, come on, man.
Cut the bullshit.

1195
01:20:00,250 --> 01:20:02,315
What really made you
change your mind?

1196
01:20:05,510 --> 01:20:09,085
You. You did, Eddie.

1197
01:20:10,480 --> 01:20:13,149
Scrub diagnostics.

1198
01:20:13,150 --> 01:20:16,115
- Sir?
- Did you hear me? Initiate the launch.

1199
01:20:22,210 --> 01:20:25,279
<i>T-minus
five minutes to launch.</i>

1200
01:20:25,280 --> 01:20:28,215
<i>Auto sequence has been
initiated.</i>

1201
01:20:40,310 --> 01:20:42,285
Oh, shit.

1202
01:20:51,250 --> 01:20:54,785
<i>T-minus
four minutes, 30 seconds.</i>

1203
01:21:01,650 --> 01:21:05,409
<i>Oh, Jesus!
You can take this guy, right?</i>

1204
01:21:05,410 --> 01:21:08,109
He has got shit
you have never seen.

1205
01:21:08,110 --> 01:21:10,209
<i>What does that mean?
What are our chances?</i>

1206
01:21:10,210 --> 01:21:13,649
Hmm. Pretty much zero.

1207
01:21:13,650 --> 01:21:17,155
<i>Oh, fuck it. Well,
let's go save the planet.</i>

1208
01:21:19,550 --> 01:21:22,255
<i>T-minus four minutes.</i>

1209
01:21:25,350 --> 01:21:28,755
<i>Initiate orbiter
aerosurface profile.</i>

1210
01:21:31,420 --> 01:21:34,249
Venom. Get in the rocket.

1211
01:21:34,250 --> 01:21:38,379
No. We won't let you destroy
this world.

1212
01:21:38,380 --> 01:21:40,325
Then die.

1213
01:21:50,450 --> 01:21:52,449
- <i>Holy shit!</i>
- Told you.

1214
01:21:52,450 --> 01:21:54,685
<i>T-minus three minutes.</i>

1215
01:22:06,520 --> 01:22:08,655
You have a strong host.

1216
01:22:10,320 --> 01:22:12,255
But not strong enough.

1217
01:22:50,390 --> 01:22:53,725
<i>T-minus
two minutes, 30 seconds.</i>

1218
01:22:55,320 --> 01:22:57,055
Eddie.

1219
01:23:00,990 --> 01:23:02,955
Drake, stop!

1220
01:24:08,560 --> 01:24:11,625
Told you I could fight ugly.

1221
01:24:18,150 --> 01:24:21,065
<i>T-minus one minute.</i>

1222
01:24:38,420 --> 01:24:40,119
You're too late.

1223
01:24:40,120 --> 01:24:41,725
This is the next stage...

1224
01:24:43,790 --> 01:24:46,625
You talk too much.

1225
01:24:55,620 --> 01:24:57,589
<i>T-minus 30 seconds.</i>

1226
01:24:57,590 --> 01:24:59,825
You are nothing.

1227
01:25:27,860 --> 01:25:29,765
<i>Ten seconds.</i>

1228
01:25:29,920 --> 01:25:31,665
<i>Nine...</i>

1229
01:25:31,890 --> 01:25:33,565
<i>Eight...</i>

1230
01:25:33,890 --> 01:25:35,495
<i>Seven...</i>

1231
01:25:35,660 --> 01:25:37,189
<i>Six...</i>

1232
01:25:37,190 --> 01:25:38,825
<i>Five...</i>

1233
01:25:39,020 --> 01:25:40,659
<i>Four...</i>

1234
01:25:40,660 --> 01:25:42,189
<i>Three...</i>

1235
01:25:42,190 --> 01:25:44,059
<i>Two...</i>

1236
01:25:44,060 --> 01:25:46,665
<i>One...</i>

1237
01:25:47,860 --> 01:25:49,625
<i>Liftoff.</i>

1238
01:25:56,360 --> 01:25:57,989
Traitor!

1239
01:25:57,990 --> 01:26:00,365
Have a nice life.

1240
01:26:26,020 --> 01:26:27,995
<i>Goodbye, Eddie.</i>

1241
01:26:28,660 --> 01:26:30,695
Venom, no!

1242
01:27:29,020 --> 01:27:32,519
Hmm. You're in luck. I've
decided to work pro bono.

1243
01:27:32,520 --> 01:27:34,519
I'm joining
the public defenders' office.

1244
01:27:34,520 --> 01:27:36,489
You're a good person, Annie.

1245
01:27:36,490 --> 01:27:37,989
What about you?
What are you gonna do?

1246
01:27:37,990 --> 01:27:39,819
Uh, the network asked me
to bring the show back,

1247
01:27:39,820 --> 01:27:41,859
and they want to start
with a piece on Drake.

1248
01:27:41,860 --> 01:27:43,959
Oh, wow, really?
So, what did you say?

1249
01:27:43,960 --> 01:27:48,389
Uh, I'm not into it. I want to
concentrate on the written word.

1250
01:27:48,390 --> 01:27:50,489
I scored the interview
of a lifetime.

1251
01:27:50,490 --> 01:27:52,829
- Oh, yeah? Who?
- You're gonna have to read it.

1252
01:27:52,830 --> 01:27:55,459
Oh! Like everyone else.

1253
01:27:55,460 --> 01:27:57,065
Yeah.

1254
01:27:58,890 --> 01:28:01,735
Hey, I'm sorry about Venom.

1255
01:28:02,820 --> 01:28:04,625
Hey, um...

1256
01:28:06,690 --> 01:28:08,529
Do you want to talk
about that kiss?

1257
01:28:08,530 --> 01:28:12,335
Oh, that? You call that a kiss...
No, that was...

1258
01:28:13,360 --> 01:28:17,089
Uh, that was your
buddy's idea.

1259
01:28:17,090 --> 01:28:20,095
Oh, right. Well,
that is good to know.

1260
01:28:21,990 --> 01:28:24,965
- It did feel kind of great, though.
- What?

1261
01:28:24,990 --> 01:28:26,429
I mean, the...

1262
01:28:26,430 --> 01:28:29,959
- The power?
- Yeah. When it's, you know...

1263
01:28:29,960 --> 01:28:31,529
- Inside you?
- You know what I mean.

1264
01:28:31,530 --> 01:28:33,235
Okay.

1265
01:28:33,930 --> 01:28:35,529
- Hey, Eddie?
- Mmm-hmm?

1266
01:28:35,530 --> 01:28:37,759
We're not gonna
tell Dan about this. Okay?

1267
01:28:37,760 --> 01:28:41,489
<i>Look at her. She has no
idea we are going to get her back.</i>

1268
01:28:41,490 --> 01:28:44,429
No, I don't think so.

1269
01:28:44,430 --> 01:28:46,889
- Sorry, what was that?
- We're not gonna tell Dan.

1270
01:28:46,890 --> 01:28:48,689
Eddie, is there something
you want to tell me?

1271
01:28:48,690 --> 01:28:51,329
- Nope.
- <i>You belong with us, Annie.</i>

1272
01:28:51,330 --> 01:28:52,859
Eddie, are you sure?

1273
01:28:52,860 --> 01:28:54,859
Good Lord, look at that.

1274
01:28:54,860 --> 01:28:57,595
- Look at the time.
- I have to go.

1275
01:28:58,760 --> 01:29:00,929
- Hey, it's nice seeing you.
- Yeah.

1276
01:29:00,930 --> 01:29:03,329
You take care, all right?

1277
01:29:03,330 --> 01:29:05,735
- Yeah, you take care of yourself.
- Bye.

1278
01:29:09,060 --> 01:29:12,489
Hey. Don't give up on her.

1279
01:29:12,490 --> 01:29:14,265
Either of you.

1280
01:29:14,390 --> 01:29:15,759
We won't.

1281
01:29:15,760 --> 01:29:17,459
- <i>Who is that guy?</i>
- Okay.

1282
01:29:17,460 --> 01:29:20,029
<i>Wait.
This thing looks delicious.</i>

1283
01:29:20,030 --> 01:29:22,689
I have absolutely no problem
with you sticking around,

1284
01:29:22,690 --> 01:29:25,629
but if you do, we're gonna have to
have some ground rules, all right?

1285
01:29:25,630 --> 01:29:29,389
You cannot just go around eating
anybody that you want to.

1286
01:29:29,390 --> 01:29:31,359
- <i>I cannot?</i>
- No, you cannot.

1287
01:29:31,360 --> 01:29:33,059
All right, we need to...
We need to reiterate this.

1288
01:29:33,060 --> 01:29:36,629
There are good people
in this world, a lot of them.

1289
01:29:36,630 --> 01:29:38,929
And then there are bad people.

1290
01:29:38,930 --> 01:29:40,799
You have to tell
the difference.

1291
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:44,659
The deal is, you will only
ever be allowed to touch,

1292
01:29:44,660 --> 01:29:48,029
harm, hurt, possibly,
very possibly,

1293
01:29:48,030 --> 01:29:50,459
eat very, very bad people,

1294
01:29:50,460 --> 01:29:53,359
but never, ever,
ever good people. All right?

1295
01:29:53,360 --> 01:29:55,729
- <i>Fine.</i>
- Good.

1296
01:29:55,730 --> 01:29:57,499
<i>But how does one
tell the difference?</i>

1297
01:29:57,500 --> 01:29:59,599
Well, it's super simple.

1298
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:02,499
I mean, you just have to... You
can intuit it, you can sense it.

1299
01:30:02,500 --> 01:30:04,559
Sometimes you can
even feel it.

1300
01:30:04,560 --> 01:30:05,999
<i>Whatever you say.</i>

1301
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,059
<i>But can we get something to
eat now?</i>

1302
01:30:08,060 --> 01:30:13,489
<i>Otherwise, your liver, it's starting
to look really, really good and juicy.</i>

1303
01:30:13,490 --> 01:30:16,405
Yeah. Definitely.
I know a place down here.

1304
01:30:17,360 --> 01:30:20,265
Hey, Mrs. C.

1305
01:30:20,730 --> 01:30:22,429
How you doing, Eddie?

1306
01:30:22,430 --> 01:30:23,999
Ain't nothing changed
but the weather. You know.

1307
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,959
No.

1308
01:30:26,960 --> 01:30:30,329
So, what culinary delights will
tickle the pickle tonight?

1309
01:30:30,330 --> 01:30:31,999
<i>Tater tots
and chocolate.</i>

1310
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,265
Right. Okay, no problem.

1311
01:30:34,930 --> 01:30:37,105
The payment's due, Chen.

1312
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:39,999
Please.
I can't keep doing this.

1313
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:41,559
Now.

1314
01:30:41,560 --> 01:30:43,735
- <i>Bad guy, right?</i>
- Yep.

1315
01:30:50,660 --> 01:30:52,729
You come in here again...

1316
01:30:52,730 --> 01:30:57,399
In fact, you go anywhere in this
city, preying on innocent people,

1317
01:30:57,400 --> 01:31:00,899
and we will find you
and eat both your arms

1318
01:31:00,900 --> 01:31:02,899
- and then both of your legs.
- No, no.

1319
01:31:02,900 --> 01:31:05,969
And then we will eat your face right
off your head. Do you understand?

1320
01:31:05,970 --> 01:31:07,869
- Please...
- Yes.

1321
01:31:07,870 --> 01:31:11,759
So, you will be this armless,
legless, faceless thing, won't you,

1322
01:31:11,760 --> 01:31:16,529
rolling down the street,
like a turd in the wind?

1323
01:31:16,530 --> 01:31:19,505
- Do you feel me?
- What the hell are you?

1324
01:31:20,800 --> 01:31:23,965
We are Venom.

1325
01:31:24,900 --> 01:31:27,575
- On second thought...
- Please.

1326
01:31:34,030 --> 01:31:36,429
Eddie? What was that?

1327
01:31:36,430 --> 01:31:37,829
Oh...

1328
01:31:37,830 --> 01:31:42,235
I have a parasite. Yeah.
Night, Mrs. Chen.

1329
01:31:42,970 --> 01:31:44,499
- <i>"Parasite"?</i>
- Yeah.

1330
01:31:44,500 --> 01:31:46,499
It's a term of endearment,
that's all.

1331
01:31:46,500 --> 01:31:48,499
- <i>Apologize!</i>
- No.

1332
01:31:48,500 --> 01:31:51,429
- <i>Apologize!</i>
- All right, fine.

1333
01:31:51,430 --> 01:31:54,369
I'm sorry. So, what do you
want to do now?

1334
01:31:54,370 --> 01:31:59,105
<i>The way I see it,
we can do whatever we want.</i>

1335
01:34:25,640 --> 01:34:27,569
I need you
to stay quiet.

1336
01:34:27,570 --> 01:34:30,539
This is a "me" thing.
It is not a "we" thing.

1337
01:34:30,540 --> 01:34:34,275
- You got that?
- <i>Fine, but make it quick.</i>

1338
01:34:38,010 --> 01:34:39,569
Open on five.

1339
01:34:39,570 --> 01:34:43,305
Go. Opening up.

1340
01:34:44,770 --> 01:34:47,469
You ask me, they're dumb
to let him call the shots.

1341
01:34:47,470 --> 01:34:50,009
Second he asked
for you to interview him,

1342
01:34:50,010 --> 01:34:51,739
I'd have shut that
shit down.

1343
01:34:51,740 --> 01:34:53,909
Oh, yeah, you know the FBI.
They're just taking advantage

1344
01:34:53,910 --> 01:34:56,539
of the one and only time
he'll ever speak to anyone.

1345
01:34:56,540 --> 01:34:59,669
They're hoping that I might help them
identify some additional bodies.

1346
01:34:59,670 --> 01:35:03,339
FBI don't work up close
and personal with him.

1347
01:35:03,340 --> 01:35:07,415
The FBI will have to identify you,
if you don't follow the rules.

1348
01:35:09,870 --> 01:35:13,375
Hey, Red!
I got a visitor for you.

1349
01:35:32,910 --> 01:35:35,539
- Hi, Eddie.
- Hey.

1350
01:35:35,540 --> 01:35:39,969
Do you mind if we forego the whole
creepy serial killer thing here?

1351
01:35:39,970 --> 01:35:41,369
Sure, it's good with me.

1352
01:35:41,370 --> 01:35:43,709
I mean, I can turn it on
if you want.

1353
01:35:43,710 --> 01:35:50,569
I can talk about the Dadaist
patterns of arterial spray.

1354
01:35:50,570 --> 01:35:52,639
I bet you can.

1355
01:35:52,640 --> 01:35:55,715
Tough to see you
in this light, Eddie.

1356
01:35:55,940 --> 01:35:57,575
Come on over.

1357
01:35:57,940 --> 01:36:00,015
All right.

1358
01:36:04,440 --> 01:36:05,739
I'm here.

1359
01:36:05,740 --> 01:36:10,075
When I get out of here,
and I will,

1360
01:36:10,810 --> 01:36:13,375
there's gonna be carnage.
