Tess, there is such
thing as right and wrong.

00:00:04,029 --> 00:00:06,230
You're married.
What if I wasn't?

4
00:00:06,298 --> 00:00:09,467
What you're doing,
it only ends one way.

5
00:00:12,371 --> 00:00:14,172
I wasn't the only senior
partner who voted for Hardman,

6
00:00:14,239 --> 00:00:15,573
and I don't see you
giving anyone else shit

7
00:00:15,641 --> 00:00:16,741
the way you give me.

8
00:00:16,809 --> 00:00:18,009
And by the way,
when the chips were down,

00:00:18,077 --> 00:00:19,911
I backed you, I ousted him.

Tell yourself
whatever you want, Louis.

11
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:22,814
But tell it to yourself.

12
00:00:22,881 --> 00:00:26,517
I can't go away
with you, Harvey.

13
00:00:26,585 --> 00:00:29,620
Why not?

14
00:00:29,688 --> 00:00:31,489
The next time I have an option

15
00:00:31,557 --> 00:00:33,391
to cross the line to save you,

16
00:00:33,459 --> 00:00:35,660
I'll send you packing
and not think twice.

17
00:00:35,728 --> 00:00:40,231
Now get your shit together.

18
00:00:40,299 --> 00:00:41,833
You need to go,

19
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:44,602

How nice,

When are they gonna take
that down?

23

Just doesn't have the same ring.

24
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:20,571
Pearson Paulsen
sounds pretty good.

25
00:01:20,639 --> 00:01:22,039
Okay. No, it doesn't.

26
00:01:22,107 --> 00:01:23,207
How's my day?

27
00:01:23,275 --> 00:01:24,208
How was your night?

28
00:01:24,276 --> 00:01:25,510
And by night, I mean weekend,

29
00:01:25,577 --> 00:01:27,078
and by weekend, I mean Zoe.

30
00:01:27,146 --> 00:01:29,080
It was fine.

00:01:29,148 --> 00:01:30,148
That's it?

00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:32,316
No fun banter?

No witty repartee?

And you're in the office
at exactly 8:00.

35
00:01:36,488 --> 00:01:38,256
Not early, which would mean
it went badly,

36
00:01:38,323 --> 00:01:40,083
and not late, which would mean
it went great.

37
00:01:40,092 --> 00:01:41,259
But exactly on time,
which means...

Do you want to talk about it?

Bananas are part
of a healthy breakfast.

46

And who cares
about the bananas?

47
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:56,641
It has chocolate.

48
00:01:56,708 --> 00:01:58,668
Okay, you caught me.
I don't even eat the bananas.

49
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:01,245
8:00 a.m. means the business
day has already started.

Okay, you have
an 8:02 with Trent Devon.

55
00:02:09,721 --> 00:02:10,721
Well, I didn't meet you
at the elevator

about your weekend.

Fine. Get Mike.

and my associate is not?

I think it's a bad idea,

I'm not sure going public

That's why I'm here.

It's about the changes
around here.

I may be a tech head,
but I'm not oblivious.

This firm just went
through a battle, and I know it.

that you don't trust me

above the firm's?

to blame you.

what you're chewing on?

to rescind an offer

a firm-wide hiring freeze.

180
00:06:16,401 --> 00:06:19,303
Okay, well, all it is
is another form to fill out.

181
00:06:19,371 --> 00:06:20,571
So if that's what you're worried
about, it's fine.

182
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,339
What I'm worried about
is the fact

183
00:06:22,407 --> 00:06:23,528
that I could've told him that

184
00:06:23,575 --> 00:06:24,615
had you been at the meeting

185
00:06:24,643 --> 00:06:26,043
this morning at 8:00.

186
00:06:26,111 --> 00:06:27,232
What? I checked the schedule.

187
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:28,446
There was nothing on it
for this morning.

188
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:30,614
It happened spontaneously,
as things do.

189
00:06:30,682 --> 00:06:31,882
And I was there.

190
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:33,617
You were not there.

191
00:06:33,685 --> 00:06:35,086
[Tapping keys]

192
00:06:35,153 --> 00:06:36,320
Did you not hear me

193
00:06:36,388 --> 00:06:37,788
when I told you to get
your shit together?

194
00:06:37,856 --> 00:06:39,290
No, I did hear you, and I did

195
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:40,758
get my shit together,
by the way.

196
00:06:40,826 --> 00:06:42,426
That's why I'm late
this morning.

197
00:06:42,494 --> 00:06:44,261
Deciding to be late
to get your shit together

198
00:06:44,329 --> 00:06:46,063
is not getting
your shit together.

199
00:06:46,131 --> 00:06:47,364
Get it through your head.

200
00:06:47,432 --> 00:06:48,599
We just went
through a civil war,

201
00:06:48,667 --> 00:06:49,600
and the world knows it.

202
00:06:49,668 --> 00:06:50,701
We're weak.

203
00:06:50,769 --> 00:06:52,103
And the law of the jungle says

204
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:53,204
the weak get eaten.

205
00:06:53,271 --> 00:06:55,106
Okay, Harvey, I'm sorry,

206
00:06:55,173 --> 00:06:56,294
but you need to ease up here.

207
00:06:56,341 --> 00:06:57,441
[Shouts] Ease up?

208
00:06:57,509 --> 00:06:59,477
You're telling me to ease up

209
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:00,811
when our clients are leaving?

210
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:03,347
That's right,
Trent Devon might leave.

211
00:07:03,415 --> 00:07:04,715
People don't leave me!

212
00:07:04,783 --> 00:07:06,283
- I-I...
- Enough!

213
00:07:06,351 --> 00:07:08,853
Your job is to help me,
not to screw me.

214
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,054
If I tell you you did that,

215
00:07:10,122 --> 00:07:11,722
I don't want to hear
that you didn't.

216
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:13,357
I should've fired you
last week.

217
00:07:13,425 --> 00:07:14,792
You know what,
I should fire you right now.

218
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:16,894
But I cut you slack
because your grandmother died.

219
00:07:16,962 --> 00:07:18,729
Well, you've used up the rope.

220
00:07:18,797 --> 00:07:22,466

- Donna, I don't...
- I do.

- He deserved it.
- He deserved a slap.

233
00:08:09,352 --> 00:08:11,953
You knocked him

She's leaving New York

to take care of her niece
whose father is dying.

238
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,368
Oh, my God.

239
00:08:26,436 --> 00:08:29,271
Harvey, I'm sorry.

240
00:08:29,338 --> 00:08:31,673
Is there anything...

241
00:08:31,741 --> 00:08:34,443
No.

242
00:08:35,545 --> 00:08:38,380
Just one thing.

243
00:08:38,448 --> 00:08:41,450
I don't think kicking
the dog is gonna help.

244
00:08:51,694 --> 00:08:56,131
Wow, you look like hell.

245
00:08:56,199 --> 00:08:57,499
Jimmy.

246
00:08:57,567 --> 00:08:59,134
You here to pick a fight
with me?

247
00:08:59,202 --> 00:09:00,402
'Cause I'm really
not in the mood.

248
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:02,871
No, no, Mike.
It's not like that, man.

249
00:09:02,939 --> 00:09:04,306
Oh, yeah?
You're not still pissed at me?

250
00:09:04,373 --> 00:09:06,074
You gave me an out.

251
00:09:06,142 --> 00:09:07,609
I might not have respected it
at the time,

252
00:09:07,677 --> 00:09:08,710
but I do now.

253
00:09:08,778 --> 00:09:09,738
As far as I'm concerned,

254
00:09:09,779 --> 00:09:10,712
I owe you one. Okay.

255
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:11,901
Yeah. Let me buy you a drink.

256
00:09:11,948 --> 00:09:12,981
Two conditions.

257
00:09:13,049 --> 00:09:14,149
One: You still owe me one.

258
00:09:14,217 --> 00:09:17,252
Two: You still owe me one.

259
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,154
As long as I still
don't owe you one.

260
00:09:19,222 --> 00:09:21,623
Bartender.
It's good to see you, man.

261
00:09:21,691 --> 00:09:23,492
You too, buddy.
So what's going on?

262
00:09:23,559 --> 00:09:26,161
You had a bad day? Yeah.

263
00:09:26,229 --> 00:09:27,529
Okay. So give it to me.

264
00:09:27,597 --> 00:09:29,197
Well, evidently,
getting in at 8:30

265
00:09:29,265 --> 00:09:30,599
can only mean one thing.

266
00:09:30,666 --> 00:09:31,833
Yeah, that you had
your head up your ass

267
00:09:31,901 --> 00:09:34,436
from 7:00 to 8:15.
- How'd you know?

268
00:09:34,504 --> 00:09:36,238
Are you forgetting
I used to work for Louis too?

269
00:09:36,305 --> 00:09:38,940
And unlike you, I didn't have
Harvey there to protect me.

270
00:09:39,008 --> 00:09:40,442
No, this was Harvey.

271
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:43,044
Whoa. Ain't that some shit.

272
00:09:43,112 --> 00:09:44,312
Anyway,

273
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:45,313
here's to the wonderful world

274
00:09:45,381 --> 00:09:47,415
of being an associate, right?

275
00:09:47,483 --> 00:09:48,683
[Glasses clink] Yeah.

276
00:09:48,751 --> 00:09:50,252
Pearson Hardman.

277
00:09:50,319 --> 00:09:53,622
What does that mean?

278
00:09:53,689 --> 00:09:55,690
I'm at Bratton Gould, my man.

279
00:09:55,758 --> 00:09:57,926
And I'm happy. No!

280
00:09:57,994 --> 00:09:59,394
Associates don't get
to be happy, Jimmy.

281
00:09:59,462 --> 00:10:01,396
No, you do at Bratton Gould.

282
00:10:01,464 --> 00:10:05,166
I got an office.

283
00:10:05,234 --> 00:10:07,469
- Shoot me now.
- [Laughs]

284
00:10:07,537 --> 00:10:09,004
That's great.

285
00:10:09,071 --> 00:10:10,238
Listen, Mike.

286
00:10:10,306 --> 00:10:12,240
When I said
that I owe you one, I mean it.

287
00:10:12,308 --> 00:10:14,809
'Cause you didn't hear it
from me, but we're expanding.

288
00:10:14,877 --> 00:10:15,810
So if you want to jump,
just let me know.

289
00:10:15,878 --> 00:10:17,112
I'll put in a word for you.

290
00:10:17,179 --> 00:10:19,047
- I can't leave Harvey.
- Screw Harvey.

291
00:10:19,115 --> 00:10:23,351
I mean, what's he done for you?

292
00:10:23,419 --> 00:10:24,686
More than you know.

293
00:10:24,754 --> 00:10:27,255
Okay, maybe.

294
00:10:27,323 --> 00:10:29,190
But a year
under Harvey Specter,

295
00:10:29,258 --> 00:10:30,959
they would kill to have you.

296
00:10:31,027 --> 00:10:34,462
And you wouldn't be
the only one.

297
00:10:35,965 --> 00:10:37,766
There are people
from Pearson Hardman

298
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:39,134
going to Bratton Gould? Who?

299
00:10:39,201 --> 00:10:40,602
I can't tell you that.

300
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:41,770
Jimmy,
you have to tell me that.

301
00:10:41,837 --> 00:10:42,871
Mike, come on.

302
00:10:42,939 --> 00:10:43,939
If they knew it came from me...

303
00:10:44,006 --> 00:10:46,174
They won't.

304
00:10:48,811 --> 00:10:53,648
I saw Clark and Owens meeting
with our partners.

305
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:56,217
If you're here to give me

306
00:10:56,285 --> 00:10:57,325
your letter of resignation,

307
00:10:57,353 --> 00:10:58,653
I'll accept it in the morning.

308
00:10:58,721 --> 00:11:00,889
Oh, that's ironic.
I was offered a job tonight.

309
00:11:00,957 --> 00:11:02,857
- Congratulations.
- I passed.

310
00:11:02,925 --> 00:11:04,025
You want credit for that?

311
00:11:04,093 --> 00:11:05,994
No, I want to do the job
I already have.

312
00:11:06,062 --> 00:11:08,363
Apology accepted.

313
00:11:08,431 --> 00:11:10,765
Bratton Gould
is poaching our associates,

314
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:12,300
Clark, Owens,

315
00:11:12,368 --> 00:11:13,301
but he's also coming after...

316
00:11:13,369 --> 00:11:15,637
Our clients. Trent Devon.

317
00:11:15,705 --> 00:11:16,805
Someone's whispering
in his ear.

318
00:11:16,872 --> 00:11:18,139
Allison Holt.

319
00:11:18,207 --> 00:11:19,774
She was brought in
about a month ago.

320
00:11:19,842 --> 00:11:21,476
She was ready to throw you
under the bus.

321
00:11:21,544 --> 00:11:22,877
And Jessica threw her out.

322
00:11:22,945 --> 00:11:24,079
So you think
she's in this for revenge?

323
00:11:24,146 --> 00:11:25,180
Maybe.

324
00:11:25,247 --> 00:11:26,648
But we both know
who brought her in.

325
00:11:26,716 --> 00:11:28,850
Hardman.

326
00:11:28,918 --> 00:11:32,020
You think this is him?

327
00:11:32,088 --> 00:11:33,188
Hell of a view.

328
00:11:33,255 --> 00:11:35,357
Clark and Owens
don't deserve this.

329
00:11:35,424 --> 00:11:39,027
Which one is Owens,
by the way, the redhead?

330
00:11:39,095 --> 00:11:40,996
You don't even know
who your associates are,

331
00:11:41,063 --> 00:11:43,131
but you're here to complain
about losing them?

332
00:11:43,199 --> 00:11:45,000
You bitter
because you were fired?

333
00:11:45,067 --> 00:11:46,267
I'm not bitter, Harvey.

334
00:11:46,335 --> 00:11:48,837
Unlike you, I don't take
things personally.

335
00:11:48,904 --> 00:11:50,438
And by the way, I was right.

336
00:11:50,506 --> 00:11:52,540
I advised you to settle,
and you settled.

337
00:11:52,608 --> 00:11:54,476
Your advice was for us
to settle,

338
00:11:54,543 --> 00:11:56,111
and I lose my law license.

339
00:11:56,178 --> 00:11:57,479
And my question is,

340
00:11:57,546 --> 00:12:00,482
was taking that deal
your idea or Daniel Hardman's?

341
00:12:00,549 --> 00:12:02,684
You think Daniel's behind this?

342
00:12:02,752 --> 00:12:04,452
You met with him six days ago.

343
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,821
I'm not even gonna ask
how you know that.

344
00:12:06,889 --> 00:12:08,289
I told you before, Jessica.

345
00:12:08,357 --> 00:12:09,658
I'm a straight shooter.

346
00:12:09,725 --> 00:12:11,693
Daniel wasn't dictating
my actions then,

347
00:12:11,761 --> 00:12:13,294
and he's not now.

348
00:12:13,362 --> 00:12:15,096
Either way,
we are filing a claim

349
00:12:15,164 --> 00:12:16,364
for tortious interference.

350
00:12:16,432 --> 00:12:17,793
You're using
privileged information

351
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:18,933
to target our clients.

352
00:12:19,001 --> 00:12:21,403
You really want to cry
foul to the ref?

353
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:23,638
You know who went to the ref
more than anyone?

354
00:12:23,706 --> 00:12:26,141
Michael Jordan.
He did it quietly.

355
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:29,844
And he got six rings,
and he's my client.

356
00:12:29,912 --> 00:12:32,080
Maybe I should call him too.

357
00:12:32,148 --> 00:12:33,748
You're not getting Trent Devon.

358
00:12:33,816 --> 00:12:36,518
You can't keep people
who want to leave, Harvey.

359
00:12:36,585 --> 00:12:39,020
Everybody knows
about your civil war.

360
00:12:39,088 --> 00:12:41,156
Pearson Hardman
is falling apart.

361
00:12:41,223 --> 00:12:42,891
And I'm telling you,

362
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:47,796
the avalanche
has already started.

363
00:12:53,636 --> 00:12:54,969
The Carillo contracts,
they should be signed

364
00:12:55,037 --> 00:12:56,471
and on my desk. I know.

365
00:12:56,539 --> 00:12:57,806
Well,
since you're so in the know,

366
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,040
perhaps you can tell me
why I don't have them yet.

367
00:12:59,108 --> 00:13:01,676
- Because they're not signed.
- Not signed?

368
00:13:01,744 --> 00:13:03,078
I called earlier to have them
to have them messengered...

369
00:13:03,145 --> 00:13:04,379
The story's already
taking too long.

370
00:13:04,447 --> 00:13:05,413
And they said
they didn't need to see them.

371
00:13:05,481 --> 00:13:06,815
Still waiting.

372
00:13:06,882 --> 00:13:08,583
They said
they're no longer a client.

373
00:13:08,651 --> 00:13:10,585
Harold.

374
00:13:10,653 --> 00:13:12,087
No. Harold didn't...

375
00:13:12,154 --> 00:13:14,189
Louis,
Harold didn't do anything.

376
00:13:14,256 --> 00:13:15,590
Harold never does anything.

377
00:13:15,658 --> 00:13:17,192
He got me the contracts
first thing this morning.

378
00:13:17,259 --> 00:13:18,393
He worked all night.
They were really quite...

379
00:13:18,461 --> 00:13:19,794
[grunts] Excuse me.
They were really quite...

380
00:13:19,862 --> 00:13:22,063
- "Quite" what?
- Good, actually.

381
00:13:22,131 --> 00:13:23,598
Uhhuh. And how many
citations you correct?

382
00:13:23,666 --> 00:13:24,866
- None.
- You're lying.

383
00:13:24,934 --> 00:13:26,835
- No, I'm not.
- I don't care.

384
00:13:26,902 --> 00:13:28,903
Wow. Yeah. That is a tattoo.

385
00:13:28,971 --> 00:13:30,572
- It's cool, right?
- Yeah.

386
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:34,075
Manatee... the slow,
gentle cow of the sea.

387
00:13:34,143 --> 00:13:36,511
Uh, no. It's a shark actually.

388
00:13:36,579 --> 00:13:38,446
Totally. No... yes.

389
00:13:38,514 --> 00:13:39,547
That's a shark.

390
00:13:39,615 --> 00:13:42,617
That is a big, wide, fat shark.

391
00:13:42,685 --> 00:13:44,219
You're fired.

392
00:13:44,286 --> 00:13:46,721
- You can't fire Mike.
- <i>You.</i>

393
00:13:46,789 --> 00:13:49,124
You moron. You can't
even get your firing right.

394
00:13:49,191 --> 00:13:52,293
- I'm fired?
- Louis, come on.

395
00:13:52,361 --> 00:13:53,628
Pack up your things and go.
Now.

396
00:13:53,696 --> 00:13:54,896
But I did everything you asked.

397
00:13:54,897 --> 00:13:56,231
I delivered
the Carillo contracts.

398
00:13:56,298 --> 00:13:57,432
I don't care.

399
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:00,101
The client fired us,
and now I'm firing you.

400
00:14:00,169 --> 00:14:01,669
Times are tough, people.

401
00:14:01,737 --> 00:14:04,806
We can't afford mistakes.
We can't afford incompetence.

402
00:14:04,874 --> 00:14:07,075
You can't cut it, get out.

403
00:14:07,143 --> 00:14:08,476
There is no place
for mediocrity here

404
00:14:08,544 --> 00:14:09,878
at Pearson Hardman,

405
00:14:09,945 --> 00:14:13,882
and there's certainly no place
for someone like you.

406
00:14:13,949 --> 00:14:17,519
Everyone else get back to work.

407
00:14:26,925 --> 00:14:27,925
You know, I didn't just do

408
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,227
what he asked for Carillo.

409
00:14:29,294 --> 00:14:30,328
I went way beyond.

410
00:14:30,396 --> 00:14:31,729
I didn't make any mistakes,

411
00:14:31,797 --> 00:14:33,231
and I know that they're not
leaving because of me.

412
00:14:33,298 --> 00:14:34,999
So why didn't you
say that to him?

413
00:14:35,067 --> 00:14:37,902
Because he makes me freeze.

414
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:39,003
[Sighs]

415
00:14:39,071 --> 00:14:40,238
You know, sometimes I wish

416
00:14:40,305 --> 00:14:42,807
we would've known each other
at Harvard.

417
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:46,511
Yeah. Yeah. Harvard.

418
00:14:46,578 --> 00:14:48,379
You probably hung out
with Duncan and those guys.

419
00:14:48,447 --> 00:14:50,748
I hung out with the library.

420
00:14:50,816 --> 00:14:52,383
I'm such a loser.

421
00:14:52,451 --> 00:14:53,951
No, you're not, Harold.

422
00:14:54,019 --> 00:14:55,520
Look, for the record,

423
00:14:55,587 --> 00:14:58,122
Duncan was a douche.
He <i>was</i> a douche.

424
00:14:58,190 --> 00:14:59,991
- Totally.
- Like a douchy-douche.

425
00:15:00,059 --> 00:15:01,292
Do you remember that thing
he used to do with the...

426
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,640
- I know.
- You know what I mean?

427
00:15:02,695 --> 00:15:05,396
[Laughter]

428
00:15:05,464 --> 00:15:06,964
See, that's what I mean.

429
00:15:07,032 --> 00:15:08,066
If you would've known me there,

430
00:15:08,133 --> 00:15:09,300
then at least
someone here would know

431
00:15:09,368 --> 00:15:10,468
that I wasn't always like this.

432
00:15:10,536 --> 00:15:12,036
People used to come to me

433
00:15:12,104 --> 00:15:13,838
for help on their essays.

434
00:15:13,906 --> 00:15:15,606
We'd sit in the quiet
of my apartment

435
00:15:15,674 --> 00:15:17,141
where no one was yelling at me,

436
00:15:17,209 --> 00:15:19,577
and I could think and write.

437
00:15:19,645 --> 00:15:23,481
- Really?
- Yeah.

438
00:15:23,549 --> 00:15:26,050
Here.

439
00:15:26,118 --> 00:15:28,386
This is the first essay
I wrote in law school.

440
00:15:28,454 --> 00:15:30,655
Look
at the Professor's comments.

441
00:15:30,723 --> 00:15:32,757
Holy shit.

442
00:15:32,825 --> 00:15:36,394
Louis is right.
I don't belong here.

443
00:15:36,462 --> 00:15:38,162
No, he's not.

444
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:39,597
- Thomas.
- Poconos weekend.

445
00:15:39,665 --> 00:15:41,165
- With the girlfriend.
- Which one?

446
00:15:41,233 --> 00:15:43,601
- Doesn't matter.
- Done. Winters?

447
00:15:43,669 --> 00:15:45,069
- Lunch with the mayor.
- Campos.

448
00:15:45,137 --> 00:15:47,071
- Lunch with me.
- Lunch with me.

449
00:15:47,139 --> 00:15:49,207
- Benson?
- Box at the Garden.

450
00:15:49,274 --> 00:15:50,575
Have Lundqvist meet him
pre-game.

451
00:15:50,642 --> 00:15:51,576
Does the king do that?

452
00:15:51,643 --> 00:15:53,177
He does for me. Siebertz.

453
00:15:53,245 --> 00:15:54,712
- Tickets.
- Super Bowl.

454
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:56,280
- Broadway.
- Really?

455
00:15:56,348 --> 00:15:57,482
Beneath that lumberjack chest

456
00:15:57,549 --> 00:15:58,583
beats the heart of a songbird.

457
00:15:58,650 --> 00:16:00,618
Fine. Anything but <i>Cats.</i>

458
00:16:00,686 --> 00:16:01,619
<i>Cats</i> closed over a decade ago.

459
00:16:01,687 --> 00:16:03,020
What took 'em so long?

460
00:16:03,088 --> 00:16:05,456
That's it then. We're done.

461
00:16:05,524 --> 00:16:06,758
Closed them all.

462
00:16:06,825 --> 00:16:09,360
That's just foreplay.
We didn't close shit.

463
00:16:09,428 --> 00:16:11,229
I want to have talked
to every one of my clients

464
00:16:11,296 --> 00:16:12,463
by the end of the day.

465
00:16:12,531 --> 00:16:14,866
You stay on Trent Devon
until he takes the call.

466
00:16:14,933 --> 00:16:16,000
I will.

467
00:16:16,068 --> 00:16:18,035
And, Harvey...

468
00:16:18,103 --> 00:16:21,773
No one is leaving you.

469
00:16:25,444 --> 00:16:26,711
[Knock on door] Okay.

470
00:16:26,779 --> 00:16:28,679
Harold is totally freaked out.

471
00:16:28,747 --> 00:16:30,114
I think he's gonna have
an ulcer,

472
00:16:30,182 --> 00:16:31,983
but the good news is he'll never
disappoint you again,

473
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:36,187
so you can go and magnanimously
hire him back now.

474
00:16:36,255 --> 00:16:37,522
Why would I do that?

475
00:16:37,589 --> 00:16:40,024
Um, I don't know,
because you made your point.

476
00:16:40,092 --> 00:16:41,959
You think that was a show?

477
00:16:42,027 --> 00:16:44,862
Look, I know Harold can be...

478
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:46,397
Harold.

479
00:16:46,465 --> 00:16:48,199
He's an idiot savant
minus the savant.

480
00:16:48,267 --> 00:16:50,334
He tries hard.
He's a good person.

481
00:16:50,402 --> 00:16:52,203
Yeah, well, then tell him
to join the Peace Corps.

482
00:16:52,271 --> 00:16:54,272
Why don't you just give him
a second chance?

483
00:16:54,339 --> 00:16:56,841
I did, Mike.
It was called his second day.

484
00:16:56,909 --> 00:16:58,230
You realize you need cause,
right?

485
00:16:58,243 --> 00:16:59,477
You want a cause?

486
00:16:59,545 --> 00:17:01,112
He left a zero off
the Hopkins settlement,

487
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:03,648
which cost the client $360,000.

488
00:17:03,715 --> 00:17:05,683
He filed a motion
with the appeals court

489
00:17:05,751 --> 00:17:08,186
instead of the superior court,
which accidentally triggered

490
00:17:08,253 --> 00:17:09,387
a death penalty review.

491
00:17:09,454 --> 00:17:11,022
And then the one and only time

492
00:17:11,089 --> 00:17:13,891
that I take him to court
with me, his fly was down,

493
00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:16,260
and he called the judge
"Your Owner."

494
00:17:16,328 --> 00:17:19,030
[Laughs]

495
00:17:19,097 --> 00:17:21,799
You know why he does
those things, right?

496
00:17:21,867 --> 00:17:23,801
Because you intimidate him.

497
00:17:23,869 --> 00:17:25,670
You brutalize him.

498
00:17:25,737 --> 00:17:26,737
You're always talking
about how great

499
00:17:26,805 --> 00:17:27,905
you are at grooming us.

500
00:17:27,973 --> 00:17:29,574
Well, you were not great
at grooming him.

501
00:17:29,608 --> 00:17:31,242
If he can't take
a drill sergeant yelling at him,

502
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:32,777
how can he handle
people shooting at him?

503
00:17:32,845 --> 00:17:34,085
People don't shoot at us,
Louis.

504
00:17:34,112 --> 00:17:36,948
Don't they?

505
00:17:37,015 --> 00:17:38,216
Okay. You know what?

506
00:17:38,283 --> 00:17:42,253
You want him to stay...

507
00:17:42,321 --> 00:17:45,756
Fine. He can stay.

508
00:17:45,824 --> 00:17:46,791
Thank you.

509
00:17:46,859 --> 00:17:47,959
One condition.

510
00:17:48,026 --> 00:17:49,493
You personally guarantee

511
00:17:49,561 --> 00:17:51,028
every piece of work product

512
00:17:51,096 --> 00:17:52,697
that Harold sends
out of this office

513
00:17:52,764 --> 00:17:53,931
just like I have.

514
00:17:53,999 --> 00:17:55,166
You check everything he does.

515
00:17:55,234 --> 00:17:56,701
You cross every "t,"
dot every "I,"

516
00:17:56,768 --> 00:17:59,537
and still do everything
you have to for Harvey.

517
00:17:59,605 --> 00:18:02,540
People may not be shooting
at us, but we are at war.

518
00:18:02,608 --> 00:18:05,109
So how does that work for you?

519
00:18:05,177 --> 00:18:09,413
Do we have a deal?

520
00:18:15,487 --> 00:18:19,156
Harold.

521
00:18:19,224 --> 00:18:21,325
I was just coming by
to wish you well.

522
00:18:21,393 --> 00:18:23,394
Thanks, Rachel,
but I think it's gonna be okay.

523
00:18:23,462 --> 00:18:25,296
Mike's talking to Louis
right now.

524
00:18:25,364 --> 00:18:26,430
Really?

525
00:18:26,498 --> 00:18:28,933
That's great.

526
00:18:33,605 --> 00:18:36,440
Well?

527
00:18:42,381 --> 00:18:45,316
There was nothing I could do.

528
00:18:45,384 --> 00:18:48,686
It's okay.
I know you tried, Mike.

529
00:18:48,754 --> 00:18:50,788
If it'll make you feel better,

530
00:18:50,856 --> 00:18:53,457
you're not the only person
being let go this week.

531
00:18:53,525 --> 00:18:56,594
Well, Clark and Owens
are only getting let go

532
00:18:56,662 --> 00:18:57,828
because someone found out
that they're moving

533
00:18:57,896 --> 00:18:59,797
to Bratton Gould
with McKinney and Kline.

534
00:18:59,865 --> 00:19:01,832
- They are?
- Yeah, I overheard it.

535
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:05,036
I guess some people
will choose any port in a storm.

536
00:19:05,103 --> 00:19:09,674
Harold, good luck.

537
00:19:09,741 --> 00:19:13,244
You too.

538
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:23,821
[Sighs]

539
00:19:23,889 --> 00:19:25,690
This sucks. It does.

540
00:19:25,757 --> 00:19:29,360
He didn't deserve that.

541
00:19:33,799 --> 00:19:35,066
Allison's not done.

542
00:19:35,133 --> 00:19:36,801
We know.
We're working all the clients.

543
00:19:36,868 --> 00:19:39,303
No, it's more than that.
She's taking McKinney and Kline.

544
00:19:39,371 --> 00:19:40,338
It's just two more associates.

545
00:19:40,405 --> 00:19:44,675
No, it's more than that.

546
00:19:44,743 --> 00:19:46,410
I tell you
the rats are jumping ship,

547
00:19:46,478 --> 00:19:47,611
and you say it's fine,
but Donna nods,

548
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:49,079
and you're busting out
life jackets?

549
00:19:49,114 --> 00:19:50,681
You have a history
of panicking.

550
00:19:50,749 --> 00:19:51,782
He's not panicking.

551
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:53,484
Clark, Owens, McKinney, Kline...

552
00:19:53,552 --> 00:19:54,785
these aren't just fifth-years.

553
00:19:54,853 --> 00:19:56,153
They're the best fifth-years.

554
00:19:56,221 --> 00:19:57,861
They're Louie's
first class of associates.

555
00:19:57,923 --> 00:19:59,690
He gave her a report card?

556
00:19:59,758 --> 00:20:01,926
Harvey, you do not know that.

557
00:20:01,994 --> 00:20:03,894
Well,
I'm gonna goddamn find out.

558
00:20:03,962 --> 00:20:06,964
[Laughs] Stop.

559
00:20:07,032 --> 00:20:08,566
Just cut it out.

560
00:20:08,633 --> 00:20:09,834
All right,
I'll talk to you later.

561
00:20:09,901 --> 00:20:11,335
Bye.

562
00:20:11,403 --> 00:20:12,903
I never liked you, Louis.

563
00:20:12,971 --> 00:20:14,839
You're a vindictive,
sniveling rat,

564
00:20:14,906 --> 00:20:16,907
but I never thought
you'd betray your own firm.

565
00:20:16,975 --> 00:20:19,210
I never betrayed this firm.

566
00:20:19,277 --> 00:20:20,717
What do you call helping
Allison Holt

567
00:20:20,746 --> 00:20:21,746
poach our associates?

568
00:20:21,813 --> 00:20:23,881
I had nothing to do with that.

569
00:20:23,949 --> 00:20:25,549
I love this firm, Harvey.

570
00:20:25,617 --> 00:20:27,084
You were a traitor
when you voted for Hardman,

571
00:20:27,152 --> 00:20:28,285
and you're a traitor now.

572
00:20:28,353 --> 00:20:29,587
Like I've told you before,

573
00:20:29,654 --> 00:20:30,688
I'm not the only one

574
00:20:30,756 --> 00:20:31,756
in this firm
who voted for Hardman.

575
00:20:31,823 --> 00:20:33,090
And I voted to oust him
once I knew.

576
00:20:33,158 --> 00:20:35,059
Once you knew you had
to save your own ass.

577
00:20:35,127 --> 00:20:36,327
All right, you know what,
Harvey, just get out.

578
00:20:36,395 --> 00:20:40,164
Get out.

579
00:20:40,232 --> 00:20:43,801
Ri... I did nothing wrong.

580
00:20:43,869 --> 00:20:45,436
Jesus!

581
00:20:45,504 --> 00:20:47,071
You bugged my office.

582
00:20:47,139 --> 00:20:49,407
You ran to Hardman
about the CM lawsuit.

583
00:20:49,474 --> 00:20:51,776
You sold your soul
for senior partnership.

584
00:20:51,843 --> 00:20:54,278
And once you got it,
you created a drug policy

585
00:20:54,346 --> 00:20:57,248
with the sole purpose
of firing me!

586
00:20:57,315 --> 00:20:58,282
I did it for Hardman.

587
00:20:58,350 --> 00:20:59,617
Maybe Hardman wanted me dead,

588
00:20:59,684 --> 00:21:01,185
but you're the one
who went out,

589
00:21:01,253 --> 00:21:02,820
got the gun, aimed it,

590
00:21:02,888 --> 00:21:04,889
and fired it at my head.

591
00:21:04,956 --> 00:21:06,157
And it blew up in my face!

592
00:21:06,224 --> 00:21:09,493
And what would have happened
if it didn't?

593
00:21:09,561 --> 00:21:11,362
I was under orders.

594
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:12,950
Were you also under orders
when you ran

595
00:21:12,998 --> 00:21:14,498
to Hardman about Monica Eton?

596
00:21:14,566 --> 00:21:17,101
How do you know it was me?

597
00:21:17,169 --> 00:21:19,170
Because I set it up!

598
00:21:19,237 --> 00:21:22,406
Because I know who you are!

599
00:21:22,474 --> 00:21:25,142
Are you still gonna tell me

600
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:26,644
you're not helping Allison?

601
00:21:26,711 --> 00:21:28,813
Harvey, I swear to God

602
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,449
I did not do this.

603
00:21:31,516 --> 00:21:32,716
Maybe not.

604
00:21:32,784 --> 00:21:34,552
But now that you've done
what you've done,

605
00:21:34,619 --> 00:21:38,556
I will never trust you.

606
00:21:40,292 --> 00:21:42,927
Pearson Hardman is my life.

607
00:21:42,994 --> 00:21:45,996
Well, here's what's
gonna happen from now on.

608
00:21:46,064 --> 00:21:49,266
You and I, we're done.

609
00:21:49,334 --> 00:21:51,769
Don't drop by my office.

610
00:21:51,837 --> 00:21:54,438
Don't ask Donna
for information.

611
00:21:54,506 --> 00:21:55,873
You're the guy
that nobody wants

612
00:21:55,941 --> 00:21:59,743
but we can't get rid of.

613
00:21:59,811 --> 00:22:02,480
I'm a senior partner.

614
00:22:02,547 --> 00:22:04,615
So I can't make you leave.

615
00:22:04,683 --> 00:22:07,051
But as far as I'm concerned,

616
00:22:07,119 --> 00:22:10,855
you don't even work here
anymore.

617
00:22:10,922 --> 00:22:13,591
[Clatters]

618
00:22:30,299 --> 00:22:34,502
That glass
does not look half full.

619
00:22:38,274 --> 00:22:41,543
You're cherry-picking
Pearson Hardman associates.

620
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:42,911
I only want the best cherries.

621
00:22:42,978 --> 00:22:46,447
Then why not go
after the gardener who grew 'em?

622
00:22:46,515 --> 00:22:48,750
You want to leave
Pearson Hardman.

623
00:22:48,817 --> 00:22:51,753
I'm a proven commodity who
delivers outstanding billables.

624
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:53,288
With an unparalleled knowledge
of finance.

625
00:22:53,355 --> 00:22:55,223
Yeah, I'm well aware
of who you are, Louis.

626
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:57,859
But how do I know
that Harvey Specter

627
00:22:57,927 --> 00:22:59,427
didn't just send you here?

628
00:22:59,495 --> 00:23:01,629
'Cause I'm the last person
that Harvey Specter would trust.

629
00:23:01,697 --> 00:23:02,664
Just ask Daniel Hardman.

630
00:23:02,731 --> 00:23:05,266
I did.
He said you betrayed him.

631
00:23:05,334 --> 00:23:07,502
Like I said,
I am well aware of who you are.

632
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:09,137
Well, if you spoke to Daniel,
then you would know

633
00:23:09,204 --> 00:23:11,639
that he lost Pearson Hardman
not because of my betrayal

634
00:23:11,707 --> 00:23:12,807
but because of his own.

635
00:23:12,875 --> 00:23:16,911
My loyalty does not sway
with the wind.

636
00:23:16,979 --> 00:23:18,513
I'm leaving Pearson Hardman

637
00:23:18,581 --> 00:23:20,081
because there's no room
for me there anymore.

638
00:23:20,149 --> 00:23:21,649
You could go anywhere.

639
00:23:21,717 --> 00:23:23,251
Well, I've done my homework.

640
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:26,955
You guys are expanding.
You are hiring well.

641
00:23:27,022 --> 00:23:29,457
You're gonna have a young staff

642
00:23:29,525 --> 00:23:30,725
that needs guidance.

643
00:23:30,793 --> 00:23:32,493
You know
that I'm the right fit.

644
00:23:32,561 --> 00:23:33,928
And I want to move now.

645
00:23:33,996 --> 00:23:35,697
You have a non-compete clause.

646
00:23:35,764 --> 00:23:37,244
Jessica is gonna waive
the non-compete

647
00:23:37,266 --> 00:23:38,666
as long
as I don't take clients.

648
00:23:38,734 --> 00:23:41,736
- I wouldn't if I were her.
- Well, you're not.

649
00:23:41,804 --> 00:23:43,004
Harvey wants me gone,

650
00:23:43,072 --> 00:23:46,808
and he has a way
of getting what he wants, so...

651
00:23:49,144 --> 00:23:50,845
There might be
a partnership position

652
00:23:50,913 --> 00:23:53,314
for you.

653
00:23:53,382 --> 00:23:55,149
Senior partnership.

654
00:23:55,217 --> 00:23:57,652
That, you're gonna have
to earn.

655
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:58,987
I have earned it.

656
00:23:59,054 --> 00:24:00,388
And I'm not giving up
what I've worked for

657
00:24:00,456 --> 00:24:01,589
my whole life.

658
00:24:01,657 --> 00:24:04,592
Louis, you have made
a tactical error.

659
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:06,094
You've shown me all your cards,

660
00:24:06,161 --> 00:24:07,695
you can't offer any clients,

661
00:24:07,763 --> 00:24:09,097
and you're being forced
to leave a place

662
00:24:09,164 --> 00:24:10,298
that doesn't want you.

663
00:24:10,366 --> 00:24:13,368
You are a very good fit for us.

664
00:24:13,435 --> 00:24:16,037
But if you want to join us,

665
00:24:16,105 --> 00:24:18,773
you're gonna have to prove
how much you want it.

666
00:24:18,841 --> 00:24:20,008
Please don't do this.

667
00:24:20,075 --> 00:24:22,510
Do what? I'm just negotiating.

668
00:24:22,578 --> 00:24:26,147
You have an empty title.

669
00:24:26,215 --> 00:24:30,051
If you come with us, I promise

670
00:24:30,119 --> 00:24:33,388
that you will be truly valued.

671
00:24:42,031 --> 00:24:43,598
Well, that's it.

672
00:24:43,666 --> 00:24:45,566
I've talked to every client
except Trent Devon.

673
00:24:45,634 --> 00:24:46,701
Well, I know why he's returning.

674
00:24:46,769 --> 00:24:48,049
Allison's calls
instead of yours.

675
00:24:48,103 --> 00:24:49,270
Because he thinks
we're not focused.

676
00:24:49,338 --> 00:24:50,371
That's not enough.

677
00:24:50,439 --> 00:24:52,807
Come on. You taught me
to always ask...

678
00:24:52,875 --> 00:24:54,008
What's in it for him?

679
00:24:54,076 --> 00:24:55,556
"If we're looking
to expand our reach,

680
00:24:55,577 --> 00:24:57,011
"then Trent Devon's
data platform

681
00:24:57,079 --> 00:24:59,847
provides the perfect symbiosis
with our search algorithms."

682
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:03,551
Page 23,
the CEO of flash-start.

683
00:25:03,619 --> 00:25:05,553
Allison doesn't represent them.

684
00:25:05,621 --> 00:25:08,189
Google bought Meebo
for $100 million.

685
00:25:08,257 --> 00:25:09,524
Allison is trying to do
the same thing

686
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:10,591
with Flash-Start.

687
00:25:10,659 --> 00:25:12,360
Allison doesn't represent them.

688
00:25:12,428 --> 00:25:14,796
Pretend she does.

689
00:25:14,863 --> 00:25:16,998
Trent gets $100 million,

690
00:25:17,066 --> 00:25:18,566
but his company
gets swallowed up,

691
00:25:18,634 --> 00:25:19,767
and that's not what he wants.

692
00:25:19,835 --> 00:25:20,802
Well, what if they let him run
both companies?

693
00:25:20,869 --> 00:25:21,909
That's too good to be true.

694
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:23,071
It's happened before.

695
00:25:23,138 --> 00:25:25,039
So if that's true,
all we need to do

696
00:25:25,107 --> 00:25:26,607
is figure out a way
to beat that deal.

697
00:25:26,675 --> 00:25:29,977
We can't beat that deal.

698
00:25:30,045 --> 00:25:33,214
Okay. So what do we do?

699
00:25:39,822 --> 00:25:40,955
Why didn't you just tell me?

700
00:25:41,023 --> 00:25:42,557
Allison said you had a history

701
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:45,059
and that it might get in the way
of what she was offering.

702
00:25:45,127 --> 00:25:47,195
- Flash-Start.
- Very good.

703
00:25:47,262 --> 00:25:48,496
But Allison
doesn't represent them.

704
00:25:48,564 --> 00:25:50,798
No, but she does represent
a hedge fund

705
00:25:50,866 --> 00:25:53,101
that's about to buy
a controlling interest.

706
00:25:53,168 --> 00:25:54,268
And let me guess.

707
00:25:54,336 --> 00:25:55,903
They want you
to run the whole thing.

708
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:57,939
We'll take on Google.

709
00:25:58,006 --> 00:25:59,774
And let me guess.

710
00:25:59,842 --> 00:26:01,209
You're here to try and beat it.

711
00:26:01,276 --> 00:26:03,711
No, I'm here to tell you
to take it.

712
00:26:03,779 --> 00:26:05,079
If I were you, I would,

713
00:26:05,147 --> 00:26:07,882
and I would hire the lawyer
who brought it to me.

714
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:08,883
Thanks, Harvey.

715
00:26:08,951 --> 00:26:09,984
You're welcome.

716
00:26:10,052 --> 00:26:13,755
There's just one thing.

717
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:16,190
I wonder, what's in it for her?

718
00:26:16,258 --> 00:26:17,391
What are you implying?

719
00:26:17,459 --> 00:26:19,193
Let me look over the deal.
My own time.

720
00:26:19,261 --> 00:26:21,562
If it is what she says it is,
I'll tell you.

721
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:23,598
If it's not,
you'll want to know.

722
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:25,266
- Harvey, I already told you...
- Look.

723
00:26:25,334 --> 00:26:26,701
You said we weren't focused,

724
00:26:26,769 --> 00:26:28,503
and I'm not here to try
to convince you that we were.

725
00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:30,772
But you also said
you've always trusted me,

726
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:36,611
and I'm telling you,
trust me one more time.

[Knock at door]

728
00:26:40,048 --> 00:26:42,617
Louis. Do you need something?

729
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:47,922
Actually, yes.

730
00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:49,791
I need you to waive
my non-compete,

731
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:53,628
so I can take a position
at another firm.

732

Bratton Gould.

733
00:26:55,798 --> 00:26:58,399
I had nothing to do
with Allison Holt's poaching.

734
00:26:58,467 --> 00:27:01,402
What did she offer you?

735
00:27:02,971 --> 00:27:04,572
I went to her.

736
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,274
Why?

737
00:27:06,341 --> 00:27:09,977
I got Harvey's message.

738
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:12,880
What message?

739
00:27:12,948 --> 00:27:15,817
You don't know?
It doesn't matter.

740
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:17,451
This is what he wants.

741
00:27:17,519 --> 00:27:22,690
And this is what you want?

742
00:27:22,758 --> 00:27:24,258
You know
you can't take clients.

743
00:27:24,326 --> 00:27:29,163
Oh, I wouldn't even if I could.

744
00:27:29,231 --> 00:27:30,164
I have no desire
to hurt our firm...

745
00:27:30,232 --> 00:27:32,333
your firm.

746
00:27:32,401 --> 00:27:35,603
Do you know why I instituted

747
00:27:35,671 --> 00:27:38,272
the Louis Litt
rehabilitation program?

748
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:42,310
Because I was seduced
by Daniel Hardman once too.

749
00:27:42,377 --> 00:27:47,882
He made me feel special
and smart and valued.

750
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:49,550
The problem was

751
00:27:49,618 --> 00:27:52,820
he really didn't give
a shit about me.

752
00:27:52,888 --> 00:27:55,590
But I will give him one thing.

753
00:27:55,657 --> 00:27:59,961
He was right about you.

754
00:28:00,028 --> 00:28:04,966

I am not on the same page
as Harvey.

I don't want you to go.

What?

761
00:28:35,764 --> 00:28:36,898
Were we really quitting,

762
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:39,000
or was that just a move
to get to the contract?

763
00:28:39,067 --> 00:28:40,635
You don't think I have
his best interests at heart?

764
00:28:40,702 --> 00:28:42,069
That's not what I asked.

765
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:43,871
If it's a good deal,
he should take it.

766
00:28:43,939 --> 00:28:45,139
But you said
it's too good to be true.

767
00:28:45,207 --> 00:28:46,974
What else did I say?

00:28:47,042 --> 00:28:48,163
That it's my job to help you.

769
00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:49,543

They came to the meadow
every day to work, friendly.

But then when they punched
in the time clock,

842
00:32:22,683 --> 00:32:24,083
Ralph would try
to steal the sheep,

843
00:32:24,151 --> 00:32:25,518
and Sam would stop him.

844
00:32:25,586 --> 00:32:29,422
I mean, it was brutal.

845
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:32,158

they'd punch out again.

Harvey's not punching out
anymore.

can redeem you.

for Harvey.

out of my depth.

helped Allison,

got you off your game.

00:34:00,681 --> 00:34:02,682
you say,
"how do I get it back?"

887
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:06,419
I went to Louis
to get him back on board,

888
00:34:06,487 --> 00:34:08,554
and you made an end run
around me.

889
00:34:08,622 --> 00:34:10,590
When does it stop?

890
00:34:10,658 --> 00:34:11,724
We can't let Trent go
with Allison.

891
00:34:11,792 --> 00:34:14,093
He's gonna... get screwed.

892
00:34:14,161 --> 00:34:18,131
I'm... I'm sorry.

893
00:34:18,198 --> 00:34:19,666
It's nothing. [Stammers]

894
00:34:19,733 --> 00:34:21,768
It's just some stairs.
[Mutters]

895
00:34:21,835 --> 00:34:23,136
[Chuckles]

896
00:34:23,203 --> 00:34:25,705
Oh, God.

897
00:34:25,773 --> 00:34:28,074
I'm so sorry.
I didn't see her there.

898
00:34:28,142 --> 00:34:29,242
Who did this to you?

899
00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:31,110
- I'm fine.
- You're not.

900
00:34:31,178 --> 00:34:32,612
And after I'm done
kicking his ass,

901
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:34,113
the guy who did it
isn't gonna be either.

902
00:34:34,181 --> 00:34:35,949
- Harvey, just let it go.
- That's not who I am.

903
00:34:36,016 --> 00:34:38,484
I deserved it.

904
00:34:38,552 --> 00:34:41,754
- What did you do?
- I don't want to tell you.

905
00:34:41,822 --> 00:34:43,356
I wouldn't call this
getting your shit together.

906
00:34:43,424 --> 00:34:44,691
I don't want to tell you
because of the story

907
00:34:44,758 --> 00:34:48,761
you told me about your mom
and your dad.

908
00:34:50,664 --> 00:34:51,798
You got off easy.

909
00:34:51,865 --> 00:34:55,168
I know.

910
00:34:56,937 --> 00:34:58,237
It's a bad deal.

911
00:34:58,305 --> 00:34:59,739
What, you're reading
between the lines?

912
00:34:59,807 --> 00:35:01,975
'Cause I couldn't find anything
in the contract.

913
00:35:02,042 --> 00:35:03,977
Because the problem's
not in the contract.

914
00:35:04,044 --> 00:35:05,878
You said it yourself.
The deal's too good to be true.

915
00:35:05,946 --> 00:35:07,113
The financials
don't support it.

916
00:35:07,181 --> 00:35:08,815
What, you get your MBA
overnight?

917
00:35:08,882 --> 00:35:10,316
No.

918
00:35:10,384 --> 00:35:12,018
You went to Louis?

919
00:35:12,086 --> 00:35:13,386
We worked all night.

920
00:35:13,454 --> 00:35:14,754
He didn't betray us, Harvey.
He found the problem.

921
00:35:14,822 --> 00:35:16,856
They never wanted anything to do
with Trent's company.

922
00:35:16,924 --> 00:35:18,024
After the deal,
they're just gonna sell it off

923
00:35:18,092 --> 00:35:19,325
for spare parts.

924
00:35:19,393 --> 00:35:20,827
That won't get them
what they paid for it.

925
00:35:20,894 --> 00:35:22,294
But it'll get them
what they wanted.

926
00:35:22,329 --> 00:35:24,263
- Trent.
- Exactly.

927
00:35:24,331 --> 00:35:26,065
Louis figured this out?

928
00:35:26,133 --> 00:35:28,134
Trent's contract
has the same problem as Louie's.

929
00:35:28,202 --> 00:35:29,335
He's got a non-compete.

930
00:35:29,403 --> 00:35:30,470
They couldn't get him
to run the company

931
00:35:30,537 --> 00:35:31,471
unless they bought his.

932
00:35:31,538 --> 00:35:33,072
Now Louis wants back in.

933
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:34,307
No, he doesn't.

934
00:35:34,375 --> 00:35:38,011
This is just his way
of saying he's sorry.

935
00:35:44,745 --> 00:35:46,979
It's not on the menu,
but might I suggest

936
00:35:47,047 --> 00:35:48,447
the "I got my ass kicked"
Martini?

937
00:35:48,515 --> 00:35:49,682
It goes well

938
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:51,250
with the "second-tier law firm"
potato skins.

939
00:35:51,318 --> 00:35:52,518
Those come with bacon?

940
00:35:52,586 --> 00:35:54,920
I don't know, never had 'em.

941
00:35:54,988 --> 00:35:56,822
I take it
my client's not coming.

942
00:35:56,890 --> 00:35:58,157
He was your client,

943
00:35:58,225 --> 00:36:00,359
but then you offered him
a deal too good to be true.

944
00:36:00,427 --> 00:36:03,229
You got the paperwork.

945
00:36:03,296 --> 00:36:05,598
Because he trusted me.

946
00:36:05,665 --> 00:36:07,233
Well played, Harvey.

947
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:09,001
No. Here's the play.

948
00:36:09,069 --> 00:36:10,703
He's gonna take
his company public,

949
00:36:10,771 --> 00:36:12,371
like I told him to months ago.

950
00:36:12,439 --> 00:36:15,541
A deal my new client,
a certain hedge fund,

951
00:36:15,609 --> 00:36:17,276
just agreed to underwrite.

952
00:36:17,344 --> 00:36:19,211
You know Edelson Investments,
don't you?

953
00:36:19,279 --> 00:36:20,379
I do.

954
00:36:20,447 --> 00:36:22,348
Apparently,
I used to represent them.

955
00:36:22,416 --> 00:36:24,016
Ah, you're taking this well.

956
00:36:24,084 --> 00:36:25,918
What do you want me to do, cry?

957
00:36:25,986 --> 00:36:27,219
Harvey, we play the game.

958
00:36:27,287 --> 00:36:29,622
Sometimes we win,
sometimes we lose.

959
00:36:29,689 --> 00:36:31,090
Not me.

960
00:36:31,158 --> 00:36:34,627
Which brings me
to a suggestion of my own.

961
00:36:34,694 --> 00:36:36,462
Come work for Bratton Gould.

962
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:37,696
Come work for <i>you?</i>

963
00:36:37,764 --> 00:36:39,065
<i>With</i> me.

964
00:36:39,132 --> 00:36:41,172
Did you not hear what I said
about the potato skins?

965
00:36:41,234 --> 00:36:42,668
You're second-tier.

966
00:36:42,736 --> 00:36:43,969
What about you?

967
00:36:44,037 --> 00:36:45,838
There's blood in the water,
Harvey.

968
00:36:45,906 --> 00:36:47,006
You may have fended off
this attack,

969
00:36:47,074 --> 00:36:48,674
but we're not
the only ones circling.

970
00:36:48,742 --> 00:36:51,210
We fended you off,
we'll fend off the rest.

971
00:36:51,278 --> 00:36:52,411
With who?

972
00:36:52,479 --> 00:36:54,447
I got all
your best senior associates,

973
00:36:54,514 --> 00:36:56,515
your future, and I'm not done.

974
00:36:56,583 --> 00:36:58,551
We'll see about that.

975
00:36:58,618 --> 00:37:01,153
Lunch is on us.

976
00:37:01,221 --> 00:37:03,722
After all, we just landed
a huge, new client.

977
00:37:03,790 --> 00:37:06,192
You say "we," but I don't see

978
00:37:06,259 --> 00:37:09,161
your name on the door.

979
00:37:09,229 --> 00:37:10,796
Mike, Mike, Mike.
I got your call.

980
00:37:10,864 --> 00:37:12,565
You said you owed me one,
right?

981
00:37:12,632 --> 00:37:13,833
Yeah, and I meant it too.

982
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:15,134
Well, you're gonna pay me back.

983
00:37:15,202 --> 00:37:17,536
I'm happy to,
'cause listen to me,

984
00:37:17,604 --> 00:37:18,838
when I bring you in,

985
00:37:18,905 --> 00:37:20,940
and you kick ass,
I look kick-ass.

986
00:37:21,007 --> 00:37:24,710
Got your resume? Right there.

987
00:37:26,513 --> 00:37:27,847
You gotta be kidding me.

988
00:37:27,914 --> 00:37:28,948
Oh, you didn't think
it was gonna be easy

989
00:37:29,015 --> 00:37:29,949
to pay me back, did you?

990
00:37:30,016 --> 00:37:31,317
Harold?

991
00:37:31,384 --> 00:37:32,985
I'm not gonna look kick-ass.

992
00:37:33,053 --> 00:37:34,620
I'm gonna look ass-kicked.

993
00:37:34,688 --> 00:37:37,022
Look at how he did.

994
00:37:37,090 --> 00:37:38,390
Are you kidding me?

995
00:37:38,458 --> 00:37:39,592
You keep saying that.

996
00:37:39,659 --> 00:37:40,860
Man, we talking
about the same Harold?

997
00:37:40,927 --> 00:37:42,461
I know.

998
00:37:42,529 --> 00:37:43,863
Seriously, Mike, man,

999
00:37:43,930 --> 00:37:45,464
if this doesn't work,
I'm gonna look like shit.

1000
00:37:45,532 --> 00:37:48,000
Jimmy, he needs a second chance

1001
00:37:48,068 --> 00:37:49,235
just like you did.

1002
00:37:49,302 --> 00:37:51,570
[Sighs] All right, all right.

1003
00:37:51,638 --> 00:37:53,172
You won't regret it.

1004
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:54,206
Harold's great.

1005
00:37:54,274 --> 00:37:57,176
You're gonna love
his new tattoo.

1006
00:37:57,244 --> 00:37:58,177
He's here, isn't he?

1007
00:37:58,245 --> 00:38:01,814
Right over there.

1008
00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:12,691
Not only do you retain
one client,

1009
00:38:12,759 --> 00:38:14,026
you landed another.

1010
00:38:14,094 --> 00:38:16,061
I knew there was a reason
why I kept you around.

1011
00:38:16,129 --> 00:38:18,764
And a reason Allison Holt's
trying to steal me away.

1012
00:38:18,832 --> 00:38:21,567
Congratulations.
I'm sure you'll be very happy.

1013
00:38:21,635 --> 00:38:23,302
What could possibly go wrong?

1014
00:38:23,370 --> 00:38:25,738
Congratulations.
That's what I said to Mike.

1015
00:38:25,805 --> 00:38:27,907
Him too? She's after everyone.

1016
00:38:27,974 --> 00:38:29,275
Don't worry. He's staying.

1017
00:38:29,342 --> 00:38:30,743
Loyal as a basset hound.

1018
00:38:30,810 --> 00:38:33,279
Oh.
Are they particularly loyal?

1019
00:38:33,346 --> 00:38:37,583
I turned her down.

1020
00:38:37,651 --> 00:38:38,584
But?

1021
00:38:38,652 --> 00:38:41,654
I want my name on the door.

1022
00:38:41,721 --> 00:38:45,691
I don't want to end
around you anymore.

1023
00:38:45,759 --> 00:38:49,328
I want to discuss things
with you as an equal.

1024
00:38:49,396 --> 00:38:51,163
It's a little late for that,
don't you think?

1025
00:38:51,231 --> 00:38:54,466
How long are we gonna walk
by his name on the wall, huh?

1026
00:38:54,534 --> 00:38:55,935
They're coming after us,

1027
00:38:56,002 --> 00:38:58,337
and they're not gonna stop
until we send them a message

1028
00:38:58,405 --> 00:38:59,471
that we are whole.

1029
00:38:59,539 --> 00:39:01,040
I'm not gonna just slap

1030
00:39:01,107 --> 00:39:02,841
someone else's name up there,
Harvey.

1031
00:39:02,909 --> 00:39:05,444
- "Someone"?
- I told you once.

1032
00:39:05,512 --> 00:39:07,947
You don't make decisions
when you're reeling from a loss.

1033
00:39:08,014 --> 00:39:10,983
And your response was,
"let's quit today."

1034
00:39:11,051 --> 00:39:12,618
Not quit. Fight.

1035
00:39:12,686 --> 00:39:14,553
Without any thought
for the consequences.

1036
00:39:14,621 --> 00:39:16,655
With my gut,
which serves me well.

1037
00:39:16,723 --> 00:39:18,490
As a closer, not a leader.

1038
00:39:18,558 --> 00:39:19,592
Jessica.

1039
00:39:19,659 --> 00:39:21,026
Watson, Klyman,

1040
00:39:21,094 --> 00:39:22,861
Gallo, Goldberg, Specter.

1041
00:39:22,929 --> 00:39:24,830
The first five senior partners
you named.

1042
00:39:24,898 --> 00:39:27,266
The first five major moves
I made.

1043
00:39:27,334 --> 00:39:29,201
All success stories.

1044
00:39:29,269 --> 00:39:31,370
Last week,
you had me steal someone

1045
00:39:31,438 --> 00:39:33,906
from the D.A.'s office
for reasons you won't say.

1046
00:39:33,974 --> 00:39:36,041
We won't even go
into what you did to Louis.

1047
00:39:36,109 --> 00:39:38,010
And then
there's the cherry on top.

1048
00:39:38,078 --> 00:39:39,478
- Mike.
- Who showed up this morning

1049
00:39:39,479 --> 00:39:41,513
beaten to a pulp.

1050
00:39:41,581 --> 00:39:42,881
He also beat Hardman to a pulp.

1051
00:39:42,949 --> 00:39:45,417
One day, what he is
isn't going to be enough

1052
00:39:45,485 --> 00:39:47,386
to make up for what he isn't.

1053
00:39:47,454 --> 00:39:51,090
Which is how you feel about me.

1054
00:39:51,157 --> 00:39:53,692
Harvey, what was
Michael Jordan's record

1055
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:54,727
on the Bulls?

1056
00:39:54,794 --> 00:39:57,563
664 wins, 285 losses.

1057
00:39:57,631 --> 00:40:00,266
More than twice as many wins
than losses.

1058
00:40:00,333 --> 00:40:03,569
Do you know what his record was
in the front office?

1059
00:40:03,637 --> 00:40:05,904
- No.
- 185 to 291.

1060
00:40:05,972 --> 00:40:09,541
Almost twice as many losses
as wins.

1061
00:40:09,609 --> 00:40:10,876
You know how I know that?

1062
00:40:10,944 --> 00:40:12,711
Because you knew one day,
I'd come in here

1063
00:40:12,779 --> 00:40:15,948
asking for this.

1064
00:40:16,016 --> 00:40:17,850
Because I look at the future

1065
00:40:17,917 --> 00:40:20,586
like an adult.

1066
00:40:20,654 --> 00:40:22,921
Are you saying it's a no?

1067
00:40:22,989 --> 00:40:27,226
I'm saying
I'm not rushing this decision

1068
00:40:27,294 --> 00:40:30,229
and that your judgment
that day was wrong.

1069
00:40:37,304 --> 00:40:39,505
Thank you.

1070
00:40:41,574 --> 00:40:43,208
[Clears throat]

1071
00:40:43,276 --> 00:40:46,712
- Hey.
- Hey.

1072
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:48,247
I thought you'd like to know

1073
00:40:48,315 --> 00:40:52,851
that Harold got a job
at another firm.

1074
00:40:52,919 --> 00:40:54,714
Good.

1075
00:40:56,990 --> 00:40:58,223
Look, Rachel...

1076
00:40:58,291 --> 00:41:01,894
He found out, didn't he?

1077
00:41:01,961 --> 00:41:03,529
I just want you
to know that it was

1078
00:41:03,596 --> 00:41:07,099
after I ended things with Tess.

1079
00:41:07,167 --> 00:41:11,603
I want you to know
that I just don't give a shit.
