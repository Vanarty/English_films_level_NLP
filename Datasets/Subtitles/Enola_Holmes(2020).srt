1
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:42,500
Now, where to begin?

2
00:00:47,541 --> 00:00:50,625
The first thing you need to know
is that my mother named me Enola.

3
00:00:50,708 --> 00:00:52,125
She insisted on it, in fact!

4
00:00:52,791 --> 00:00:54,250
Enola...

5
00:00:54,875 --> 00:00:56,416
Enola.

6
00:00:57,458 --> 00:00:58,875
I know it's an unusual name,

7
00:00:58,958 --> 00:01:00,916
but my mother is rather a fan
of word games.

8
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,791
- On your marks.
- Get set.

9
00:01:02,875 --> 00:01:03,708
Go!

10
00:01:04,666 --> 00:01:07,083
<i>And Enola spelled backwards</i>
<i>reads, well,</i>

11
00:01:07,791 --> 00:01:08,791
"alone."

12
00:01:10,333 --> 00:01:11,291
Yes!

13
00:01:11,375 --> 00:01:12,958
<i>She would continually tell me...</i>

14
00:01:13,041 --> 00:01:14,666
You'll do very well on your own, Enola.

15
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:16,083
Mm-hmm.

16
00:01:16,166 --> 00:01:18,416
<i>And yet we were always together.</i>

17
00:01:19,458 --> 00:01:21,041
- No. No.
- Yes!

18
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:23,583
<i>My father died when I was young.</i>

19
00:01:24,541 --> 00:01:26,208
<i>I don't really remember him.</i>

20
00:01:27,333 --> 00:01:30,250
<i>And both my brothers left home soon after.</i>

21
00:01:30,333 --> 00:01:31,916
<i>I barely remember them, either.</i>

22
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:34,625
<i>So then it was just the two of us,</i>

23
00:01:34,708 --> 00:01:35,833
<i>and it was wonderful.</i>

24
00:01:38,041 --> 00:01:39,791
<i>She was not an ordinary mother.</i>

25
00:01:39,875 --> 00:01:43,125
<i>She didn't teach me to string seashells</i>
<i>or practice my embroidery.</i>

26
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:45,708
<i>We did different things.</i>

27
00:01:47,708 --> 00:01:48,791
<i>Reading,</i>

28
00:01:51,083 --> 00:01:52,208
<i>science,</i>

29
00:01:53,041 --> 00:01:54,125
<i>sports,</i>

30
00:01:55,458 --> 00:01:57,000
<i>all sorts of exercise,</i>

31
00:01:57,666 --> 00:01:59,500
<i>both physical...</i>

32
00:01:59,583 --> 00:02:00,583
<i>...and mental.</i>

33
00:02:03,375 --> 00:02:06,333
<i>Mother said we were free to do anything</i>
<i>at Ferndell...</i>

34
00:02:10,166 --> 00:02:12,250
Oh. Sorry, Grandpa.

35
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:15,083
<i>...and be anyone.</i>

36
00:02:23,208 --> 00:02:24,625
<i>She was my whole world.</i>

37
00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:30,125
<i>But she didn't share everything with me.</i>

38
00:02:30,208 --> 00:02:32,125
Right, ladies, to conclude:
our choices.

39
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:33,958
The bankmen met,

40
00:02:34,416 --> 00:02:35,708
entangle herb,

41
00:02:37,458 --> 00:02:39,083
- Ellie Houseman.
- Ooh, marvelous.

42
00:02:39,166 --> 00:02:41,291
- Are we all agreed? Yes?
- Yes.

43
00:02:41,375 --> 00:02:43,000
Ellie Houseman.

44
00:02:43,083 --> 00:02:44,041
Of course.

45
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:50,791
<i>Mother believed</i>
<i>privacy was the highest virtue,</i>

46
00:02:51,166 --> 00:02:53,750
<i>and the one most frequently violated.</i>

47
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,750
Which leads me to the second thing
you need to know.

48
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:06,000
<i>A week ago,</i>
<i>on the July morning of my 16th birthday,</i>

49
00:03:06,083 --> 00:03:07,041
<i>I awoke...</i>

50
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:09,666
Mother?

51
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,416
<i>...to find that my mother was missing.</i>

52
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:18,291
<i>She'd left Ferndell Hall, our home,</i>

53
00:03:19,208 --> 00:03:20,958
<i>at some point during the night.</i>

54
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:22,208
Mother?

55
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:24,750
<i>And she did not return.</i>

56
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,625
She left me with little, bar some gifts

57
00:03:35,708 --> 00:03:38,000
that she instructed Mrs. Lane
to give me at teatime.

58
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,583
{\an8}What kind gifts!

59
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:54,000
{\an8}And, look, she's made this herself.

60
00:03:56,666 --> 00:03:57,666
We were happy.

61
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,083
Weren't we, Mrs. Lane?

62
00:04:00,625 --> 00:04:02,833
Shouldn't she give me
these presents herself?

63
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,250
Oh, whoa! Whoa!

64
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,125
And the third thing you need to know,

65
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:24,625
and there may be those amongst you
who have already guessed it,

66
00:04:24,708 --> 00:04:27,208
is that cycling
is not one of my core strengths,

67
00:04:27,291 --> 00:04:29,166
but needs must
when you must speed somewhere.

68
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:42,000
The fourth thing you need to know

69
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:44,708
is that I'm presently on the way
to collect my brothers,

70
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:46,333
<i>Mycroft and Sherlock,</i>

71
00:04:46,791 --> 00:04:49,375
names which backwards spell out,
respectively,

72
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:51,500
Tforcym and Kcolrehs.

73
00:04:53,958 --> 00:04:56,833
Perhaps one shouldn't read too much
into the "alone" idea.

74
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:02,958
- Thank you.
- Yes.

75
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:04,416
Sherlock Holmes.

76
00:05:06,916 --> 00:05:09,375
The famous detective, scholar, chemist,

77
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:11,041
virtuoso violinist,

78
00:05:11,458 --> 00:05:12,625
<i>expert marksman,</i>

79
00:05:12,708 --> 00:05:14,583
{\an8}<i>swordsman, singlestick fighter,</i>

80
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:15,583
<i>pugilist,</i>

81
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:17,625
and brilliant deductive thinker.

82
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:20,458
{\an8}<i>My genius brother.</i>

83
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:23,375
He will have all the answers.

84
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:32,250
Mr. Holmes?

85
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:35,125
And, um, Mr. Holmes?

86
00:05:35,208 --> 00:05:36,125
Yes.

87
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:37,708
You sent for me?

88
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:40,791
You sent a telegram.

89
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:43,208
Asked me to meet you here?

90
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:48,250
And the fifth thing you need to know

91
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:50,833
is that they haven't seen me
in quite some time.

92
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:53,291
Enola.

93
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:56,500
My God.

94
00:05:57,291 --> 00:05:58,208
Look at you.

95
00:05:58,916 --> 00:06:00,541
You're in such a mess.

96
00:06:04,583 --> 00:06:06,083
Where's your hat and your gloves?

97
00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:07,916
Well, I have a hat.

98
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,416
It just makes my head itch.
And I have no gloves.

99
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:12,291
She has no gloves?

100
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:13,625
Plainly not, Mycroft.

101
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:18,000
We didn't send for you, silly girl.
We sent for the carriage.

102
00:06:18,416 --> 00:06:20,583
-Did you at least bring it?
-The carriage?

103
00:06:21,541 --> 00:06:22,375
Yes.

104
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:26,208
What carriage would you be wanting?
Because I have a few in mind--

105
00:06:26,291 --> 00:06:28,208
The carriage I pay for.

106
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:30,000
Right.

107
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:33,625
I think you may have us confused
with another house.

108
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,625
Boy, fetch us a carriage.

109
00:06:38,708 --> 00:06:39,583
Quickly!

110
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:42,750
Oh.

111
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:45,208
What the...

112
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:48,583
Oh, dear God, look at the house.

113
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:52,958
Isn't it wonderful?

114
00:06:55,291 --> 00:06:57,791
What the hell
has she been playing at?

115
00:07:03,458 --> 00:07:05,791
Gentlemen, welcome home.

116
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:07,958
It's been some time.

117
00:07:21,791 --> 00:07:22,791
What is this?

118
00:07:24,708 --> 00:07:25,583
Tennis?

119
00:07:28,166 --> 00:07:30,250
Mother says I'm getting quite proficient.

120
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:36,125
Oh!

121
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:38,333
I suppose that's game.

122
00:07:47,791 --> 00:07:49,083
Where the hell is she?

123
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:56,750
I would say this is going quite well,
wouldn't you?

124
00:07:58,166 --> 00:07:59,541
Her bed hasn't been made.

125
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:01,250
Hmm. Chrysanthemums.

126
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:03,000
Clothes haven't been put away.

127
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:04,750
And <i>laurustinus, </i>and Queen Anne's lace.

128
00:08:04,833 --> 00:08:06,791
Enough with the bally flowers,
Sherlock.

129
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:13,833
Huh.

130
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,708
But it wasn't foul play.

131
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,458
How? Are you certain?

132
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:20,916
Her regular supply of drawing pencils
has dwindled to nothing.

133
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,375
She clearly had decided
not to replace them,

134
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:25,083
and you rarely find that kidnap victims

135
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:27,708
have planned for their own disappearance.

136
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:29,000
She wasn't returning,

137
00:08:29,583 --> 00:08:33,208
and yet she disguised her intentions
perfectly.

138
00:08:35,416 --> 00:08:36,916
That's good news, is it not?

139
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:40,375
Depends if you're relying on her
coming back.

140
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:41,333
Hmm.

141
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:46,750
Oh, good God! Feminism.

142
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:49,583
Perhaps she was mad, or senile.

143
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:53,083
Though madness, in our family?
I would doubt it.

144
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:55,458
- Ooh.
- I think I can surmise

145
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:57,583
by the way that she left
leaving no clear leads,

146
00:08:57,666 --> 00:08:59,583
she still had her full wits
about her.

147
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:03,291
No madwoman could compile the accounts
she sent me over the last ten years.

148
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:06,125
Perfectly clear and orderly,
detailing a bathroom...

149
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:08,208
- Which does not exist.
- And a water closet.

150
00:09:08,291 --> 00:09:09,291
Likewise.

151
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:11,041
And the constantly rising salaries

152
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:13,250
of the footmen, the housemaids,
the kitchen maids,

153
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:15,375
-gardeners, under gardeners...
-You get the point.

154
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:17,125
...and for Enola, a music teacher,

155
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:19,166
a dance instructor, a governess.

156
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:21,083
Enola, you at least had a governess?

157
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:24,583
She wouldn't like you in here.

158
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:26,541
This is her private space.

159
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:31,208
Tell me, she at least saw
that you had an education?

160
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:33,375
She valued education.

161
00:09:35,583 --> 00:09:37,166
She taught me herself.

162
00:09:39,833 --> 00:09:42,541
She made me read every book
in Ferndell Hall's library.

163
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:47,708
<i>Shakespeare, Locke,</i>

164
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:50,458
and the encyclopedia,

165
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:54,541
and Thackeray, and the essays
of Mary Wollstonecraft.

166
00:09:55,375 --> 00:09:57,083
And I did it on my own account.

167
00:09:58,083 --> 00:09:59,083
For my own learning.

168
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:02,666
Which, Mother said, was the best way
to become a young...

169
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:05,041
woman.

170
00:10:05,125 --> 00:10:07,291
Well, <i>this </i>is what
she wanted you to become?

171
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:08,833
-Mycroft.
-What?

172
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,250
I don't know what she wanted me to be.

173
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,750
She's left me too.

174
00:10:21,875 --> 00:10:23,750
She will return, won't she, Sherlock?

175
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:30,083
Won't she?

176
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:37,125
What is she up to, Sherlock?

177
00:10:37,208 --> 00:10:40,583
She was too old to remarry, she had
no passions or ambitions I was aware of.

178
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:43,791
She simply had to ensure Enola
a decent life

179
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:46,750
and to live her remaining years
with dignity.

180
00:10:47,875 --> 00:10:51,250
This is my house, not hers,
and has been since Father died.

181
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:53,875
She asked for 16 years
to bring up Enola here.

182
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:56,333
I gave it. And for that,
I deserve to be robbed?

183
00:10:56,416 --> 00:10:58,500
I am not the villain here.

184
00:10:58,583 --> 00:11:00,333
Perhaps she needed the money.

185
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:02,375
You clearly don't,

186
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:04,666
or has the government cut your salary?

187
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:08,125
It's always the same, isn't it?
Always the same.

188
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:11,916
We don't see each other for months,
and then you blast in without a care

189
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,916
and condemn me with your <i>bon mots.</i>

190
00:11:14,666 --> 00:11:16,625
-Simply inquiring.
-You are judging.

191
00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:19,833
You are judging something
for which <i>you </i>took no responsibility.

192
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:23,916
You've never shown an interest
in this family.

193
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:28,583
I don't mean to judge.

194
00:11:31,916 --> 00:11:33,875
We have two problems, as I see it.

195
00:11:34,458 --> 00:11:37,041
One, finding a boarding school

196
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:38,833
that is willing to take Enola on

197
00:11:38,916 --> 00:11:42,458
so she won't be a <i>complete </i>failure
in this world.

198
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:46,333
<i>That I am in the process of solving...</i>

199
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:49,500
<i>with the help of an old friend.</i>

200
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:56,208
<i>And two, finding Mother.</i>

201
00:11:57,958 --> 00:12:00,708
The first is my problem,
the second I consider yours.

202
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:02,208
My dear!

203
00:12:02,708 --> 00:12:04,291
- Oh!
- My dear!

204
00:12:04,666 --> 00:12:06,000
Ooh.

205
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:07,416
Let me.

206
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:11,333
A motor car.
How delightful, Miss Harrison.

207
00:12:11,416 --> 00:12:14,041
Well, I am an educator, Mr. Holmes.

208
00:12:14,416 --> 00:12:16,125
I like to keep ahead of the times.

209
00:12:16,916 --> 00:12:19,000
Enola <i>may </i>prefer to stay here.

210
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:21,083
You could acquire a governess.

211
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:24,916
- She needs a firm hand, Sherlock.
<i>- Where is she?</i>

212
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:25,958
She's inside,

213
00:12:26,041 --> 00:12:28,625
though I must warn you in advance,
she's unbroken.

214
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:31,208
We'll soon see about that.

215
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:33,583
We need to break her and build her up.

216
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:36,583
Stand tall, girl.

217
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:37,875
That's better.

218
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:40,708
In Mother's absence,
she is my ward, not yours.

219
00:12:40,791 --> 00:12:43,208
Waist, 24 inches.

220
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:45,500
- Chest, 33 inches.
- Well, that's too small.

221
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:46,708
They are perfectly fine.

222
00:12:46,791 --> 00:12:48,125
Hips, 35 inches.

223
00:12:48,208 --> 00:12:49,583
Oh, how disappointing.

224
00:12:49,666 --> 00:12:51,458
We will have to use an amplifier.

225
00:12:51,541 --> 00:12:56,375
A wild and dangerous woman
brought up a wild child.

226
00:12:56,458 --> 00:12:57,833
She seems intelligent.

227
00:12:57,916 --> 00:13:00,291
Hips are simply a function of legs,
aren't they?

228
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:02,250
What need have they of amplification?

229
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:04,416
Aren't you the clever little tongue?
I'll enjoy that.

230
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:07,958
I won't enjoy being imprisoned
in those preposterous clothes.

231
00:13:08,041 --> 00:13:10,791
These clothes will not imprison.
They will free.

232
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:16,083
They will allow you to fit into society,
to take part in its numerous pleasures.

233
00:13:16,166 --> 00:13:17,916
To catch an eye, to attract.

234
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:21,708
With Miss Harrison's help,
we'll make her acceptable for society.

235
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:23,958
Father would be turning in his grave.

236
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:25,625
<i>At my finishing school,</i>

237
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:28,041
you will learn how to be a young lady,

238
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:31,083
and you'll make many new friends.

239
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:35,000
I don't need friends.
I have my own company.

240
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:37,708
<i>An unedcated, underdressed,</i>

241
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:39,375
poorly mannered wildling.

242
00:13:39,458 --> 00:13:41,916
And I don't need to go
to your ridiculous school.

243
00:13:50,541 --> 00:13:52,833
No! Please don't do this to me.

244
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:55,208
Let me remain happy. I am happy here.

245
00:13:55,291 --> 00:13:58,333
You are a young woman now, Enola.
You need an education.

246
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:01,208
Test me on anything you think
I need to know

247
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:03,625
-to be sufficient for this world.
-If she taught you so well,

248
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:06,708
you wouldn't be standing
in your undergarments in front of me.

249
00:14:06,791 --> 00:14:09,208
You have no hope of making a husband
in your current state.

250
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:10,791
I don't want a husband!

251
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:14,125
And that is another thing
you need to have educated out of you.

252
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:18,083
Sherlock.

253
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:22,250
-Don't let him do this to me.
-You are his ward.

254
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:23,583
Make me yours.

255
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:25,541
Guide me. Teach me.

256
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:27,791
-For him, I am a nuisance. For you--
-Enola.

257
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:32,291
I'm sorry.

258
00:14:33,375 --> 00:14:34,458
It's out of my hands.

259
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:38,500
Just like his cruelty to our mother
was out of your hands.

260
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:41,333
She is not dangerous.

261
00:14:41,416 --> 00:14:44,375
She is remarkable and always has been.

262
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:48,000
And if you still can't see that,
then shame on you both!

263
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:50,958
So remarkable that she left you
in <i>my </i>care.

264
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:58,708
Well, we have had a lovely little chat,
haven't we?

265
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,708
I can tell we're going to be firm friends.

266
00:15:01,791 --> 00:15:04,500
Oh, Miss Harrison,
I'm so grateful for your kindness.

267
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:07,416
Mr. Holmes,

268
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:09,291
it's an honor.

269
00:15:10,166 --> 00:15:12,375
I shall bring her tomorrow myself.

270
00:15:12,791 --> 00:15:13,833
Yourself?

271
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:15,833
Good.

272
00:15:32,416 --> 00:15:34,000
I also enjoy a sketch.

273
00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:37,041
Helps me think,

274
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:38,750
process my thoughts.

275
00:15:40,291 --> 00:15:41,541
Helps me do the same.

276
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:55,875
A caricature.

277
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,375
Perhaps best if Mycroft doesn't see it.

278
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:03,416
-Do you intend to stay up there?
-I was hoping for some privacy.

279
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:07,375
You know, last I remember,
you were quite a timid little thing.

280
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:09,708
You had a pine cone wrapped in wool,

281
00:16:10,416 --> 00:16:11,916
<i>dragged it with you wherever you went,</i>

282
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:13,541
calling it Dash.

283
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:19,125
<i>Someone told you that Queen Victoria</i>
<i>had a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel</i>

284
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:20,125
called Dash,

285
00:16:20,208 --> 00:16:22,041
and you decided you wanted the same.

286
00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:25,833
We could never persuade you

287
00:16:25,916 --> 00:16:27,833
to put any trousers on.

288
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:29,375
Your bottom was always bare.

289
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:34,791
I think that's all the memories I have.

290
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:35,791
Thank you.

291
00:16:36,708 --> 00:16:38,541
If you could now forget them all.

292
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:43,375
A pine cone called Dash?

293
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:45,833
That sounds ridiculous.

294
00:16:45,916 --> 00:16:48,000
Father used to chase you
all about the place, shouting,

295
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:50,625
"Get that damn dog out of my house!"

296
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:56,458
Why did you never visit?

297
00:17:00,416 --> 00:17:01,375
I lead a busy life.

298
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:07,791
Why did you never write?

299
00:17:08,791 --> 00:17:10,291
Would you have cared for my letters?

300
00:17:15,708 --> 00:17:19,250
I have kept every clipping
of every case of yours I could ever find.

301
00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:20,750
That's flattering.

302
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:23,791
And yet it took our mother's disappearance
to bring you home.

303
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,500
She meant to go.

304
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:30,583
She's not coming back.

305
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:32,333
No.

306
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:36,583
But the truth is,
Mother always had a reason for everything.

307
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:38,833
Her own way of doing things.

308
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:42,916
And those kind of mysteries
are always the most satisfying to unpick.

309
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,958
I don't want a mystery, Sherlock.

310
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,083
I want my mother back here
and my life as it was.

311
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:50,250
You're being emotional.

312
00:17:51,541 --> 00:17:52,416
It's understandable,

313
00:17:53,333 --> 00:17:54,333
but unnecessary.

314
00:17:58,125 --> 00:17:59,250
Look for what's there,

315
00:18:00,291 --> 00:18:02,125
not what you want to be there.

316
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:05,458
You'll see the truth soon enough.

317
00:18:10,208 --> 00:18:12,125
"Own way of doing things..."

318
00:18:12,208 --> 00:18:14,041
And, look, she's made this herself.

319
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:39,708
"Alone."

320
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:42,875
That's my name.

321
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:46,333
M... S...

322
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:47,958
A...

323
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:49,291
C.

324
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:52,416
Try it backwards.

325
00:18:53,958 --> 00:18:54,791
Bear with me.

326
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:58,250
"Chrysanthemums...

327
00:18:58,666 --> 00:19:00,625
my in look...

328
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:01,666
Enola."

329
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:12,500
I hear you, Mother.

330
00:19:21,375 --> 00:19:24,083
Chrysanthemums,
chrysanthemums...

331
00:19:25,416 --> 00:19:28,583
"The bestowing of chrysanthemums
indicates familial attachment

332
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:30,916
and, by implication, affection."

333
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,333
<i>"My </i>chrysanthemums."

334
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:51,000
Not the ones she bought.

335
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:54,541
The ones she painted.

336
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:08,875
Money. She must have left a message.

337
00:20:14,041 --> 00:20:15,875
"Our future is up to us."

338
00:20:16,958 --> 00:20:18,125
What future?

339
00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:21,083
There are two paths you can take, Enola.

340
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:22,375
Yours...

341
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:25,541
or the path others choose for you.

342
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:33,000
"Our future is up to us."

343
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:42,166
Mother was able to vanish from Ferndell,
and so must I,

344
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:45,500
in the clothes
Sherlock himself grew up in.

345
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:53,333
It's a necessary distraction.

346
00:20:53,958 --> 00:20:55,666
I was just beginning to master it.

347
00:20:56,583 --> 00:20:58,500
Phase one of the plan complete.

348
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:00,541
<i>I'm coming to find you, Mother.</i>

349
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:02,708
The game is afoot.

350
00:21:13,541 --> 00:21:15,541
I couldn't go to my local station,
of course,

351
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:17,708
so I chose a different line altogether.

352
00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:20,791
With my brothers after me,
there's no telling where they'd search.

353
00:21:24,125 --> 00:21:25,958
No sign of him anywhere, sir.

354
00:21:27,291 --> 00:21:29,541
I want an assurance
that my son is not--

355
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:31,250
He's not on this train.

356
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:34,375
Of course he's on the train!
You simply haven't looked properly.

357
00:21:34,458 --> 00:21:38,000
Sir, I've had my officers search
this train from top to bottom.

358
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:40,375
-Darling, perhaps we should just--
-Quiet, Mother.

359
00:21:40,458 --> 00:21:43,875
He had the carriage drop him here
this morning. He must be here somewhere.

360
00:21:43,958 --> 00:21:46,583
Well, we're not even sure
the darling boy's on the train.

361
00:21:46,666 --> 00:21:48,500
I'm so sorry. This is such a fuss.

362
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:51,958
This train must leave.
We're running extremely late.

363
00:21:52,041 --> 00:21:55,333
-You don't understand. This is my son.
-It leaves <i>now.</i>

364
00:21:56,333 --> 00:21:58,458
Don't let this train leave
without someone on it!

365
00:21:58,541 --> 00:22:00,000
- All aboard!
- I insist!

366
00:22:23,666 --> 00:22:25,666
Enola! Time to go!

367
00:22:27,541 --> 00:22:29,500
Enola, the carriage is waiting.

368
00:22:32,166 --> 00:22:33,041
Enola?

369
00:22:43,958 --> 00:22:46,291
Sherlock!

370
00:23:22,625 --> 00:23:23,750
Whoa!

371
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:31,833
Hello.

372
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:36,708
-Please get out of this carriage.
-I can't.

373
00:23:36,791 --> 00:23:38,333
I'm in hiding.

374
00:23:39,083 --> 00:23:42,416
Bit of a to-do. Bribed a porter
to put me in this and get me onboard.

375
00:23:43,458 --> 00:23:44,458
Very daring.

376
00:23:44,541 --> 00:23:46,708
Get out of this carriage right now.

377
00:23:48,708 --> 00:23:49,666
You're a...

378
00:23:50,458 --> 00:23:52,000
a strange-looking gentleman.

379
00:23:52,458 --> 00:23:53,625
You think you look normal?

380
00:23:53,708 --> 00:23:54,708
You're not a boy at all.

381
00:23:55,458 --> 00:23:56,291
I might be a boy.

382
00:23:56,375 --> 00:23:57,875
-Who are you?
-What are you?

383
00:23:59,166 --> 00:24:00,708
I'm Viscount Tewkesbury,

384
00:24:00,791 --> 00:24:02,416
the Marquess of Basilwether.

385
00:24:03,041 --> 00:24:04,208
You're a nincompoop.

386
00:24:06,916 --> 00:24:10,125
I'll have you know, I have just undertaken
a particularly daring escape--

387
00:24:10,208 --> 00:24:12,708
You have not escaped.
There is a man in a brown bowler hat

388
00:24:12,791 --> 00:24:15,375
currently on this train searching for you,
and once he finds you,

389
00:24:15,458 --> 00:24:18,291
he will think I helped hide you,
and I will be endangered by this.

390
00:24:18,375 --> 00:24:20,875
Therefore, I ask you
to get out of this carriage.

391
00:24:27,041 --> 00:24:28,458
You remind me of my uncle.

392
00:24:28,541 --> 00:24:30,083
I've left him at the station.

393
00:24:30,166 --> 00:24:33,000
Of course he's on the train.
You simply haven't looked properly.

394
00:24:34,041 --> 00:24:35,458
He's bossy too.

395
00:24:36,208 --> 00:24:38,291
Left them all: my mother, my grandmother.

396
00:24:38,708 --> 00:24:40,708
But I'm fine. I'm free.

397
00:24:41,208 --> 00:24:42,041
Good.

398
00:24:42,708 --> 00:24:44,208
Get out of the carriage, then.

399
00:24:48,333 --> 00:24:49,750
A man in a brown bowler hat?

400
00:24:57,166 --> 00:24:58,083
It'll be fine.

401
00:25:00,083 --> 00:25:00,916
It'll be fine.

402
00:25:09,791 --> 00:25:11,291
- He's coming!
- Of course.

403
00:25:11,375 --> 00:25:13,541
- He's checking every carriage.
- Wonderful.

404
00:25:13,625 --> 00:25:14,833
You have to help me.

405
00:25:15,583 --> 00:25:17,750
- He didn't see me.
- Of course he did.

406
00:25:17,833 --> 00:25:19,125
Therefore, I say good day to you,

407
00:25:19,208 --> 00:25:21,416
Viscount Tewkesbury,
Marquess of Basilwether.

408
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:27,916
You really do remind me of my uncle.
You have that same stare.

409
00:25:38,916 --> 00:25:41,041
Ah, there you are, sir.

410
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,583
Paint your own picture, Enola.

411
00:25:49,666 --> 00:25:52,000
Don't be thrown off course
by other people.

412
00:25:52,708 --> 00:25:53,791
Especially men!

413
00:26:06,916 --> 00:26:07,833
Aah!

414
00:26:13,666 --> 00:26:14,583
Help!

415
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:16,083
Help!

416
00:26:16,458 --> 00:26:17,291
Help!

417
00:26:17,375 --> 00:26:18,625
Somebody help me!

418
00:26:20,083 --> 00:26:21,125
Help!

419
00:26:21,208 --> 00:26:22,833
Aah!

420
00:26:23,208 --> 00:26:24,583
Oh! Oh!

421
00:26:27,625 --> 00:26:28,833
Oh! Aah!

422
00:26:38,583 --> 00:26:40,750
Who is that?
He was trying to kill me!

423
00:26:40,833 --> 00:26:42,125
I'm not ready to die on a train.

424
00:26:42,208 --> 00:26:44,666
I'm not ready to die at all.
I wasn't going to before I met you.

425
00:26:47,333 --> 00:26:50,458
- Where are we going?
- I don't know yet. Let me think.

426
00:26:52,833 --> 00:26:53,666
Terribly sorry.

427
00:27:12,208 --> 00:27:15,416
-Is this truly the best way to come?
-Can you think of a better way?

428
00:27:41,666 --> 00:27:42,833
Do you trust me?

429
00:27:43,625 --> 00:27:45,041
No!

430
00:27:49,458 --> 00:27:50,708
If we time it correctly,

431
00:27:50,791 --> 00:27:53,208
-we can leave him stranded.
-Time what correctly?

432
00:27:58,791 --> 00:28:00,875
Listen, Tewkesbury.

433
00:28:00,958 --> 00:28:01,916
We have two choices.

434
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
And which one involves me <i>not </i>dying?

435
00:28:09,041 --> 00:28:10,083
This one!

436
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:31,208
Aah!

437
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:39,333
You do make an awful lot of noise,
don't you?

438
00:28:40,333 --> 00:28:42,583
Well, it turns out,
being thrown off a train

439
00:28:42,666 --> 00:28:44,625
hurts considerably more
than you might think.

440
00:28:45,958 --> 00:28:47,125
And I've lost a button.

441
00:28:55,333 --> 00:28:57,166
So now we've lost them both.

442
00:28:58,333 --> 00:29:01,833
I presume they have no clue
as to where she's gone, Mrs. Lane?

443
00:29:01,916 --> 00:29:03,333
No, they found her bicycle.

444
00:29:03,416 --> 00:29:05,250
Planted so as to send us
in the wrong direction.

445
00:29:05,958 --> 00:29:08,958
This isn't as fun as you might think,
Master Sherlock.

446
00:29:09,958 --> 00:29:11,000
She has your wits.

447
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:14,583
She runs rings around me
just as easily as you once did, but...

448
00:29:16,041 --> 00:29:18,458
-Yes?
-She knows nothing of the world.

449
00:29:20,083 --> 00:29:23,458
I must admit to being
quite seriously concerned for her.

450
00:29:23,541 --> 00:29:25,041
Mycroft will make sure to find her.

451
00:29:25,125 --> 00:29:27,375
Well, Mycroft isn't blessed
as you are.

452
00:29:27,458 --> 00:29:28,375
As she is.

453
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:30,750
A matter of great bitterness for him

454
00:29:30,833 --> 00:29:33,166
and not a small part
of the cause of this mess.

455
00:29:34,916 --> 00:29:36,166
Enola is special.

456
00:29:37,125 --> 00:29:38,583
She has such a good heart.

457
00:29:39,791 --> 00:29:42,333
She's even left money on my bedside table.

458
00:29:42,416 --> 00:29:43,291
Money?

459
00:29:45,583 --> 00:29:47,541
You've already abandoned her once, sir.

460
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,166
I'm asking
that you don't abandon her again.

461
00:30:04,916 --> 00:30:08,166
You do know you've entirely ruined
phase three of my plan?

462
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:10,833
Phase what?
Who the hell are you?

463
00:30:12,666 --> 00:30:14,333
Look, I believe our recent
brush with death

464
00:30:14,416 --> 00:30:15,500
deserves me at least a name.

465
00:30:15,583 --> 00:30:16,875
Enola Holmes.

466
00:30:18,208 --> 00:30:19,916
Holmes... Like Sherlock?

467
00:30:20,541 --> 00:30:23,916
And I am undercover, so forget I told you
that piece of information.

468
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:27,125
-Undercover working for him?
-Undercover <i>from </i>him.

469
00:30:28,166 --> 00:30:31,666
-Hence why you're dressed as a boy--
-Hence why you are to say nothing.

470
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:35,833
So?

471
00:30:38,083 --> 00:30:39,000
What?

472
00:30:41,333 --> 00:30:42,250
Thank you?

473
00:30:43,041 --> 00:30:44,875
You're supposed to say thank you.

474
00:30:44,958 --> 00:30:45,833
For what?

475
00:31:01,916 --> 00:31:03,750
We should think
about sleeping soon.

476
00:31:04,291 --> 00:31:06,083
We should think
about eating soon.

477
00:31:07,541 --> 00:31:09,000
We have nothing to eat.

478
00:31:09,666 --> 00:31:11,000
Of course we do.

479
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:14,333
<i>Arctium lappa,</i>
which you'll know as burdock.

480
00:31:15,333 --> 00:31:16,250
Very tasty.

481
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,500
Um, and then there's <i>Trifolium.</i>

482
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:20,916
Clover.

483
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,166
And is that...

484
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:23,833
Yes, I knew it!

485
00:31:25,041 --> 00:31:25,916
Mushrooms!

486
00:31:26,916 --> 00:31:28,166
<i>Agaricus lanipes.</i>

487
00:31:28,958 --> 00:31:30,083
The Princess.

488
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:32,083
Delicious.

489
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:34,958
If you can get a fire started,

490
00:31:35,041 --> 00:31:36,375
I can make us a feast.

491
00:31:38,333 --> 00:31:39,166
Fine.

492
00:31:44,833 --> 00:31:46,666
I'm not entirely an idiot, you know.

493
00:31:58,166 --> 00:31:59,041
Hmm.

494
00:31:59,958 --> 00:32:02,875
I've been thinking.
You need to disguise yourself a little.

495
00:32:03,333 --> 00:32:06,041
-How do you feel about your hair?
-I've never cared for it.

496
00:32:10,333 --> 00:32:12,625
Cut it off with a knife.
Of course you will.

497
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:18,916
Who taught you
how to sharpen it like that?

498
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,375
My mother.

499
00:32:22,958 --> 00:32:24,791
Your mother is very different to mine.

500
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:29,333
-Who taught you about flowers and herbs?
-My father.

501
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:32,541
I never really knew my father.

502
00:32:33,166 --> 00:32:34,208
My father's dead too.

503
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:38,375
I'm sorry.

504
00:32:44,541 --> 00:32:46,958
Why have you run?
From home, I mean.

505
00:32:47,375 --> 00:32:50,916
I didn't want to go to Miss Harrison's
Finishing School for Young Ladies.

506
00:32:52,333 --> 00:32:53,250
Why have you?

507
00:32:54,916 --> 00:32:55,750
Well, uh,

508
00:32:55,833 --> 00:32:59,250
a tree branch broke above me
while I was collecting wild mushrooms.

509
00:32:59,333 --> 00:33:01,791
It should have crushed me,
but I managed to roll out of the way,

510
00:33:01,875 --> 00:33:03,333
and I realized that...

511
00:33:04,291 --> 00:33:05,166
What?

512
00:33:05,666 --> 00:33:07,458
-You'll laugh at me.
-I won't.

513
00:33:10,875 --> 00:33:12,583
My life seemed to flash before me.

514
00:33:13,958 --> 00:33:16,083
I was just about to take my seat
in the House of Lords.

515
00:33:16,166 --> 00:33:19,458
I had these ideas
about how we might progress the estate.

516
00:33:20,083 --> 00:33:22,125
But my family were set
on me joining the army

517
00:33:22,208 --> 00:33:24,375
and then going overseas,
just like my uncle.

518
00:33:26,375 --> 00:33:27,791
And I realized I was scared,

519
00:33:27,875 --> 00:33:30,958
scared I would hate every second
of the rest of my life.

520
00:33:33,916 --> 00:33:35,041
Why would I laugh at that?

521
00:33:35,125 --> 00:33:36,791
-Don't I sound pathetic?
-No.

522
00:33:40,625 --> 00:33:43,041
Why were they going to send you
to the finishing school?

523
00:33:47,791 --> 00:33:49,416
In the morning, we'll have to move fast.

524
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:51,208
The bowler hat man
will be hot on your tail--

525
00:33:51,291 --> 00:33:53,291
Where's your destination? I'm going to--

526
00:33:53,375 --> 00:33:54,208
London.

527
00:33:57,375 --> 00:33:58,375
Well, then,

528
00:33:58,833 --> 00:34:00,833
shall we, um, stick together?

529
00:34:02,958 --> 00:34:04,416
If you like.

530
00:34:05,333 --> 00:34:06,333
No.

531
00:34:07,166 --> 00:34:09,166
We'll get to London
and go our separate ways.

532
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:10,500
Understood?

533
00:34:10,583 --> 00:34:11,958
Understood.

534
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:14,500
Totally. Entirely.

535
00:34:15,333 --> 00:34:17,750
Do you have to be quite so brutal
with the hair?

536
00:34:17,833 --> 00:34:18,666
Yes.

537
00:34:23,875 --> 00:34:25,750
Well, you would say that.

538
00:34:44,375 --> 00:34:47,000
- Oh, so this is where we part?
- It is.

539
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:52,291
Then, thank you, Enola Holmes,
for helping me here.

540
00:34:53,875 --> 00:34:55,875
You were supposed to have forgotten
that name.

541
00:34:56,833 --> 00:34:58,500
Then you'll have to find another.

542
00:35:08,333 --> 00:35:09,250
He'll be fine.

543
00:35:13,458 --> 00:35:14,375
<i>London:</i>

544
00:35:14,458 --> 00:35:15,916
<i>the beating heart of England.</i>

545
00:35:16,291 --> 00:35:18,041
<i>Mother will be here somewhere,</i>

546
00:35:18,125 --> 00:35:20,083
<i>and though she prepared me</i>
<i>for many things...</i>

547
00:35:20,166 --> 00:35:22,500
Oh, you've time enough
for the world.

548
00:35:22,583 --> 00:35:23,958
Let it do its damage later.

549
00:35:25,166 --> 00:35:27,250
...the outside world was not one of them.

550
00:35:29,375 --> 00:35:32,083
<i>And yet here I am,</i>
<i>at the center of civilization.</i>

551
00:35:33,541 --> 00:35:35,333
<i>The home of polite society...</i>

552
00:35:35,416 --> 00:35:37,250
Out of the sodding way, boy!

553
00:35:37,333 --> 00:35:38,333
<i>...of music,</i>

554
00:35:39,166 --> 00:35:40,000
<i>of literature...</i>

555
00:35:40,083 --> 00:35:42,916
Lords debate reform bill!
Case of the missing marquess!

556
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,875
<i>And the finest things</i>
<i>that money can buy.</i>

557
00:35:44,958 --> 00:35:46,333
A shilling apiece!

558
00:35:46,416 --> 00:35:47,250
A shilling apiece!

559
00:35:50,208 --> 00:35:53,291
<i>I must admit,</i>
<i>London isn't quite what I imagined.</i>

560
00:35:53,666 --> 00:35:56,583
<i>People are a lot more... excitable</i>
<i>than in the country.</i>

561
00:35:56,666 --> 00:35:58,000
Without this reform,

562
00:35:58,083 --> 00:36:01,583
this country isn't ours, it's theirs.

563
00:36:01,666 --> 00:36:04,291
We must petition the Lords.

564
00:36:04,375 --> 00:36:07,583
And we've not only got to do it
for ourselves, but for our children!

565
00:36:08,125 --> 00:36:09,750
Vote for change!

566
00:36:09,833 --> 00:36:13,583
So if I am to fit in
and stay hidden from my brothers,

567
00:36:15,666 --> 00:36:17,000
I must become something...

568
00:36:18,291 --> 00:36:19,250
unexpected.

569
00:36:19,333 --> 00:36:21,750
This is our chance!
Demand the vote!

570
00:36:21,833 --> 00:36:23,083
Vote for all men!

571
00:36:23,166 --> 00:36:24,875
Vote for all men!

572
00:36:29,041 --> 00:36:32,041
{\an8}No one on the trains,
no one on the boats,

573
00:36:32,625 --> 00:36:33,958
no one anywhere.

574
00:36:34,791 --> 00:36:36,250
The girl has simply vanished.

575
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:38,750
Of course, it doesn't help

576
00:36:38,833 --> 00:36:43,000
that England's suddenly consumed
by this ridiculous marquess.

577
00:36:43,458 --> 00:36:44,291
Sir?

578
00:36:44,375 --> 00:36:46,083
- Sherry, please.
- Certainly, sir.

579
00:36:46,166 --> 00:36:47,958
You haven't been offered it, have you?

580
00:36:48,041 --> 00:36:48,916
What?

581
00:36:49,791 --> 00:36:51,083
The marquess case.

582
00:36:53,083 --> 00:36:55,208
I knew his father, obnoxious sort.

583
00:36:55,791 --> 00:36:57,833
Liberal, but worth a fortune.

584
00:36:58,666 --> 00:37:00,625
I have, and I have refused it.

585
00:37:01,208 --> 00:37:03,083
I'm rather more consumed elsewhere.

586
00:37:03,416 --> 00:37:05,958
-Oh, in finding Mother?
-In finding our sister.

587
00:37:07,375 --> 00:37:08,208
No.

588
00:37:09,083 --> 00:37:09,958
No.

589
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:13,416
Your job, I made clear,
was to find Mother.

590
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:17,458
I'm looking for her too,
as will, no doubt, Enola.

591
00:37:22,041 --> 00:37:24,541
-You never cared about her before.
-She's only 16.

592
00:37:34,458 --> 00:37:36,375
You haven't given our name
in the search for her.

593
00:37:36,458 --> 00:37:37,500
Of course not.

594
00:37:37,583 --> 00:37:40,666
I don't want anyone knowing our business
any more than you do.

595
00:37:41,458 --> 00:37:43,083
Oh, don't worry, little brother.

596
00:37:43,541 --> 00:37:45,041
She may have escaped us for now,

597
00:37:45,125 --> 00:37:47,000
but I have the best police officers
in London

598
00:37:47,083 --> 00:37:49,291
looking for a child
matching her description.

599
00:37:50,708 --> 00:37:55,041
And they <i>will </i>find that stupid little girl
and bring her back to us.

600
00:37:59,041 --> 00:37:59,958
Reform.

601
00:38:01,125 --> 00:38:04,500
God help us. If there's one thing
this country doesn't need,

602
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:07,833
it's more uneducated voters.

603
00:38:08,416 --> 00:38:10,291
England is going to pot.

604
00:38:21,208 --> 00:38:23,625
And what does a boy like you
want with those?

605
00:38:27,375 --> 00:38:29,208
I shall need a whalebone corset.

606
00:38:29,833 --> 00:38:31,541
You shall need no such thing.

607
00:38:31,625 --> 00:38:33,291
This is a respectable shop.

608
00:38:33,958 --> 00:38:36,708
-Then I shall respect it.
-You don't look like you will.

609
00:38:36,791 --> 00:38:38,916
You don't smell like you will.

610
00:38:39,958 --> 00:38:40,791
And I--

611
00:38:47,166 --> 00:38:48,833
Do you have anywhere I can dress?

612
00:38:52,583 --> 00:38:53,416
In the back.

613
00:38:57,333 --> 00:39:01,541
The corset: a symbol of repression
to those who are forced to wear it.

614
00:39:02,875 --> 00:39:04,333
But for me, who chooses to wear it,

615
00:39:04,416 --> 00:39:06,583
the bust enhancer and the hip regulators

616
00:39:07,125 --> 00:39:09,916
will hide the fortune
my mother has given me.

617
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:12,000
And as they do so,

618
00:39:12,541 --> 00:39:15,500
they will make me look
like that truly unlikely thing:

619
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:18,083
a lady!

620
00:39:24,083 --> 00:39:25,750
"You have to go to school, Enola!"

621
00:39:25,833 --> 00:39:28,583
"But I don't want to go
to a finishing school, Mycroft."

622
00:39:28,666 --> 00:39:30,583
"Well, what else
are we going to do with you?

623
00:39:30,666 --> 00:39:31,916
You're a <i>girl!"</i>

624
00:39:36,833 --> 00:39:38,958
Oh, come on, seriously?

625
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:48,416
Now, where might I find a lodging house?

626
00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:50,916
I'll pay handsomely for good value.

627
00:39:54,458 --> 00:39:55,875
Is this really good value?

628
00:39:55,958 --> 00:39:57,750
Oh, best value you'll find.

629
00:39:57,833 --> 00:39:59,875
You're lucky you found me.

630
00:40:01,166 --> 00:40:02,666
Here you have it.

631
00:40:22,750 --> 00:40:23,708
It's lovely.

632
00:40:31,041 --> 00:40:34,000
<i>Now I've finally got</i>
<i>some peace and quiet to think,</i>

633
00:40:34,083 --> 00:40:35,958
it's time for phase five of my plan.

634
00:40:38,625 --> 00:40:39,875
Or possibly phase four.

635
00:40:42,208 --> 00:40:43,375
Or possibly phase six.

636
00:40:43,458 --> 00:40:45,166
I've entirely lost count.

637
00:40:47,666 --> 00:40:49,416
It is time to find my mother.

638
00:40:49,833 --> 00:40:52,250
To find Mother, the first thing
I need to do is leave a cipher

639
00:40:52,333 --> 00:40:54,083
in every newspaper she might read.

640
00:40:55,416 --> 00:40:57,083
"Thank you, my chrysanthemum.

641
00:40:57,166 --> 00:41:00,166
Are you blooming? Send iris, please."

642
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:01,708
Iris means "message."

643
00:41:02,875 --> 00:41:04,791
{\an8}Now, how to disguise them?

644
00:41:05,291 --> 00:41:07,250
Mother can untangle anything,

645
00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:10,291
so I need to make it most devious.

646
00:41:12,625 --> 00:41:14,875
<i>I placed it</i>
<i>in the personal advertisements column</i>

647
00:41:14,958 --> 00:41:16,375
<i>of </i>The Pall Mall Gazette,

648
00:41:16,458 --> 00:41:18,291
which my mother seldom missed.

649
00:41:19,250 --> 00:41:21,250
Plus the <i>Magazine of Modern Womanhood...</i>

650
00:41:23,708 --> 00:41:25,500
<i>...and </i>The Journal of Dress Reform...

651
00:41:27,958 --> 00:41:30,375
two publications
I thought might tickle her.

652
00:41:33,791 --> 00:41:35,875
This gentleman seems to be getting
 a lot of attention.

653
00:41:35,958 --> 00:41:37,875
Well, he's a bloomin' marquess.

654
00:41:38,791 --> 00:41:41,250
Then I had to find out
who she really was.

655
00:41:41,333 --> 00:41:42,208
Is.

656
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:43,125
Was.

657
00:41:43,583 --> 00:41:46,833
My mother only corresponded
with one address with regularity.

658
00:41:46,916 --> 00:41:49,000
<i>It was wrong of me</i>
<i>to look where it was addressed to,</i>

659
00:41:49,458 --> 00:41:51,916
<i>and entirely wrong of me</i>
<i>to have memorized it.</i>

660
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,208
<i>But when growing up in the countryside,</i>
<i>there is little excitement,</i>

661
00:41:55,291 --> 00:41:57,875
<i>so one clings to whatever narratives</i>
<i>one can get.</i>

662
00:42:06,583 --> 00:42:08,791
More macaroons, please, Jason.

663
00:42:13,833 --> 00:42:14,666
Afternoon.

664
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:15,833
Afternoon.

665
00:42:22,041 --> 00:42:23,000
What's up there?

666
00:42:23,333 --> 00:42:24,666
Noisy bloody women!

667
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:30,708
No, harder.
Don't be afraid of her.

668
00:42:31,125 --> 00:42:32,916
Step forward this time. Good.

669
00:42:34,541 --> 00:42:35,375
Good afternoon.

670
00:42:37,208 --> 00:42:39,416
-You wanting to be recruited?
-No.

671
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:40,833
Uh...

672
00:42:40,916 --> 00:42:43,166
I'm looking for Eudoria Vernet Holmes.

673
00:42:44,541 --> 00:42:45,375
Enola?

674
00:42:46,250 --> 00:42:47,583
Enola Holmes.

675
00:42:47,666 --> 00:42:48,875
It is you, isn't it?

676
00:42:51,541 --> 00:42:53,541
Why are you dressed like a powder puff?

677
00:42:54,875 --> 00:42:56,208
Oh, my!

678
00:42:57,083 --> 00:42:58,583
You look the spit of her.

679
00:43:01,416 --> 00:43:02,583
You recognize me?

680
00:43:03,041 --> 00:43:04,000
Of course I do.

681
00:43:04,833 --> 00:43:06,375
I was your first teacher.

682
00:43:07,125 --> 00:43:08,125
Don't you remember?

683
00:43:14,291 --> 00:43:16,250
You've progressed nicely, I can see.

684
00:43:20,083 --> 00:43:21,958
You're alone? In London?

685
00:43:23,208 --> 00:43:24,041
Yes.

686
00:43:24,791 --> 00:43:27,208
There was a useless boy,
but I rid myself of him.

687
00:43:27,833 --> 00:43:28,791
Hmm.

688
00:43:28,875 --> 00:43:31,333
I have money, lodgings.
I just need to find her.

689
00:43:32,166 --> 00:43:34,458
What makes you think
that she wants to be found?

690
00:43:35,666 --> 00:43:37,791
Eudoria's been hiding all her life.

691
00:43:38,291 --> 00:43:40,375
If she wants to stay hidden, she will.

692
00:43:41,541 --> 00:43:44,208
-And besides, she has work to do.
-What work?

693
00:43:46,083 --> 00:43:47,000
I cannot say.

694
00:43:49,458 --> 00:43:51,333
Right, ladies, our choices:

695
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,041
the bankmen met, entangle herb,

696
00:43:54,625 --> 00:43:56,083
or Ellie Houseman.

697
00:44:00,750 --> 00:44:02,750
So you were at that meeting too.

698
00:44:03,083 --> 00:44:05,666
So, we're all agreed?
Ellie Houseman.

699
00:44:06,625 --> 00:44:08,083
Who is Ellie Houseman?

700
00:44:12,375 --> 00:44:15,083
-I wish I could help you more.
-You can, but you won't.

701
00:44:15,791 --> 00:44:17,333
I must get back to my students.

702
00:44:17,416 --> 00:44:19,166
-You can see yourself out.
-Hey!

703
00:44:30,458 --> 00:44:32,750
Ah, the corkscrew.

704
00:44:37,375 --> 00:44:39,333
You could never manage that one, could ya?

705
00:44:42,083 --> 00:44:43,541
If you wanna stay in London,

706
00:44:44,166 --> 00:44:45,291
be tough,

707
00:44:46,083 --> 00:44:47,083
be tough,

708
00:44:47,625 --> 00:44:48,625
live the life,

709
00:44:49,125 --> 00:44:51,083
but don't do it
because you're looking for someone.

710
00:44:51,708 --> 00:44:53,708
Do it because you're looking for yourself.

711
00:45:22,125 --> 00:45:23,375
<i>...our choices:</i>

712
00:45:24,250 --> 00:45:25,125
<i>the bankmen met,</i>

713
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:26,958
entangle herb,

714
00:45:27,041 --> 00:45:28,416
or Ellie Houseman.

715
00:45:28,958 --> 00:45:30,291
<i>"The bankmen met."</i>

716
00:45:30,750 --> 00:45:33,458
<i>- My mother is rather a fan of word games.</i>
<i>- Word games.</i>

717
00:45:33,541 --> 00:45:36,166
<i>She made me read every book</i>
<i>in Ferndell's library.</i>

718
00:45:36,250 --> 00:45:37,083
<i>Every book.</i>

719
00:45:37,166 --> 00:45:38,083
<i>"Bankmen met."</i>

720
00:45:38,583 --> 00:45:40,875
<i>Bankmen... met.</i>

721
00:45:41,333 --> 00:45:43,458
<i>...the bankmen met...</i>

722
00:45:43,541 --> 00:45:44,708
<i>The Embankment!</i>

723
00:45:45,041 --> 00:45:47,291
<i>We need to make a decision.</i>
<i>Entangle herb.</i>

724
00:45:49,250 --> 00:45:50,791
<i>"Entangle herb."</i>

725
00:45:50,875 --> 00:45:52,208
<i>...entangle herb...</i>

726
00:45:52,291 --> 00:45:53,416
<i>Bethnal Green.</i>

727
00:45:54,875 --> 00:45:56,083
<i>So, we're all agreed?</i>

728
00:45:56,166 --> 00:45:57,375
<i>We're all agreed?</i>

729
00:45:57,458 --> 00:45:59,333
- <i>Ellie Houseman...</i>
<i>- </i><i>Agreed?</i>

730
00:45:59,416 --> 00:46:00,791
<i>Ellie Houseman.</i>

731
00:46:00,875 --> 00:46:03,333
- <i>Ellie Houseman.</i>
<i>- </i><i>Ellie Houseman.</i>

732
00:46:03,416 --> 00:46:05,333
<i>Ellie House...man.</i>

733
00:46:06,208 --> 00:46:07,166
<i>House.</i>

734
00:46:15,750 --> 00:46:17,458
<i>Limehouse Lane.</i>

735
00:46:17,541 --> 00:46:19,791
<i>- Ellie Houseman.</i>
<i>- </i><i>So, we're all agreed?</i>

736
00:46:21,625 --> 00:46:23,166
<i>Limehouse Lane.</i>

737
00:46:51,541 --> 00:46:53,541
Are we going home now?

738
00:46:54,375 --> 00:46:55,250
Yes.

739
00:46:55,833 --> 00:46:57,500
I'm hungry, Mother.

740
00:46:58,083 --> 00:46:59,291
I know, dear.

741
00:47:44,875 --> 00:47:48,250
Try to be excited, not disappointed,

742
00:47:48,875 --> 00:47:50,958
at the possibilities of something new.

743
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:45,875
Mycroft was right.

744
00:48:47,375 --> 00:48:48,750
You <i>are </i>dangerous.

745
00:48:56,166 --> 00:48:57,791
And Sherlock was right too.

746
00:49:00,250 --> 00:49:01,833
You do have a plan.

747
00:49:06,166 --> 00:49:07,666
What are you planning, Mother?

748
00:49:10,458 --> 00:49:11,916
Do I want to find you?

749
00:49:14,333 --> 00:49:15,250
Let's do it again.

750
00:49:43,791 --> 00:49:47,083
I will ask you this only once.
Where is the marquess?

751
00:49:48,583 --> 00:49:49,625
Now, who would that be?

752
00:49:54,583 --> 00:49:55,791
We went our separate ways.

753
00:50:00,208 --> 00:50:02,291
I've not seen him.

754
00:50:02,375 --> 00:50:04,250
I have nothing to do with him.

755
00:50:04,333 --> 00:50:05,750
That's a shame.

756
00:50:07,250 --> 00:50:08,708
Well, you've seen my face now.

757
00:50:08,791 --> 00:50:11,250
No, your face
is totally unmemorable!

758
00:50:55,875 --> 00:50:57,000
I'm not sure I ever described

759
00:50:57,083 --> 00:50:59,375
how a typical day's education worked
with my mother.

760
00:50:59,458 --> 00:51:00,541
Hmm.

761
00:51:00,625 --> 00:51:02,333
We'd start with history.
She always said...

762
00:51:02,416 --> 00:51:05,333
Historical perspective
is the only way to begin a day.

763
00:51:06,666 --> 00:51:07,833
<i>Then we'd lunch,</i>

764
00:51:08,583 --> 00:51:09,791
and I'd work on my physics.

765
00:51:10,250 --> 00:51:12,291
<i>Then after lunch, I'd focus on fitness...</i>

766
00:51:12,375 --> 00:51:13,208
Got you!

767
00:51:13,291 --> 00:51:14,750
...followed by fight combat.

768
00:51:15,750 --> 00:51:17,208
Hands up! Hands up! Up!

769
00:51:29,541 --> 00:51:31,083
Up again. Come on.

770
00:53:23,375 --> 00:53:25,625
I knew this would have
a truer use.

771
00:53:27,583 --> 00:53:29,416
No more surprises.

772
00:53:30,166 --> 00:53:31,041
No.

773
00:53:33,250 --> 00:53:34,083
No.

774
00:54:08,791 --> 00:54:10,541
When I was a child, I cut my knee open

775
00:54:10,625 --> 00:54:12,458
trying to save a sheep
from the cliff edge.

776
00:54:14,875 --> 00:54:16,666
I almost died, in truth.

777
00:54:19,916 --> 00:54:21,041
Mother was angry.

778
00:54:27,416 --> 00:54:28,500
Very angry.

779
00:54:29,541 --> 00:54:31,583
<i>It is good</i>
<i>to care for the vulnerable,</i>

780
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,166
but not if it means risking your life.

781
00:54:35,666 --> 00:54:37,500
Sometimes you have to let nature...

782
00:54:38,250 --> 00:54:39,208
take its course.

783
00:54:39,875 --> 00:54:41,250
Do you hear me?

784
00:54:42,833 --> 00:54:43,833
<i>The truth is,</i>

785
00:54:44,250 --> 00:54:47,625
I did not ask for Viscount Tewkesbury,
Marquess of Basilwether in my life.

786
00:54:48,666 --> 00:54:52,375
<i>I did not </i>want <i>the Viscount Tewkesbury,</i>
<i>Marquess of Basilwether in my life.</i>

787
00:54:53,750 --> 00:54:55,333
So why do I feel responsibility

788
00:54:55,666 --> 00:54:58,291
for the Viscount Tewkesbury,
Marquess of Basilwether?

789
00:54:59,541 --> 00:55:00,375
Because...

790
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:03,375
there are those that want to hurt him...

791
00:55:04,666 --> 00:55:06,375
and he has not the strength
to stop them...

792
00:55:06,458 --> 00:55:09,458
...and I do have that strength.

793
00:55:11,291 --> 00:55:12,416
<i>She would have me leave him.</i>

794
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:14,541
He is foolish,

795
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,541
and proud, and utterly ridiculous.

796
00:55:21,208 --> 00:55:22,666
But he's on the edge of a cliff.

797
00:55:24,375 --> 00:55:26,583
<i>Mother, you will have to wait.</i>

798
00:56:01,333 --> 00:56:03,458
When looking to travel incognito,

799
00:56:03,791 --> 00:56:05,583
it's safest to travel as a widow.

800
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:09,583
People are always anxious
to avoid conversations about death.

801
00:56:10,583 --> 00:56:11,625
Widows scare them,

802
00:56:12,458 --> 00:56:14,958
and there's no better disguise than fear.

803
00:56:24,708 --> 00:56:27,250
Miss May Beatrice Posy.

804
00:56:32,083 --> 00:56:33,083
'Tis I.

805
00:56:33,166 --> 00:56:37,041
For the Lady Tewkesbury,
Marchioness of Basilwether.

806
00:56:58,458 --> 00:57:01,625
- What's your business here?
- I'm a private detective.

807
00:57:01,708 --> 00:57:02,958
I've come to offer my services.

808
00:57:03,041 --> 00:57:05,916
My sister-in-law
has all the help she needs. Show her out.

809
00:57:07,750 --> 00:57:08,750
I believe I can help you.

810
00:57:08,833 --> 00:57:11,541
You are a reporter
for one of those dirty newspapers.

811
00:57:11,625 --> 00:57:13,125
I am a lady detective.

812
00:57:14,375 --> 00:57:15,291
Please leave,

813
00:57:16,083 --> 00:57:17,458
before we make you leave.

814
00:57:18,875 --> 00:57:20,250
I work for Sherlock Holmes.

815
00:57:25,458 --> 00:57:26,291
I...

816
00:57:26,791 --> 00:57:28,000
I'm his assistant.

817
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,375
He sends me ahead of time
to prepare the ground.

818
00:57:35,375 --> 00:57:37,291
Sherlock Holmes is interested
in our case?

819
00:57:39,291 --> 00:57:41,166
- Yes.
- And he...

820
00:57:41,666 --> 00:57:45,125
sent along a widow to fleece his path?

821
00:57:46,458 --> 00:57:47,875
A very good issue to take.

822
00:57:49,375 --> 00:57:50,958
May have overthought my outfit.

823
00:57:52,958 --> 00:57:55,833
Widowhood doesn't impact on my ability
to do my job.

824
00:57:55,916 --> 00:57:58,291
- Sherlock trusts me to--
-Poppycock!

825
00:57:58,375 --> 00:58:00,250
I'm sorry, but I've heard enough.

826
00:58:00,333 --> 00:58:02,416
You do not know Sherlock Holmes.

827
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:06,083
Oh, Lestrade. So pleased you could make
this young lady's acquaintance.

828
00:58:06,166 --> 00:58:08,083
I am Lestrade of Scotland Yard,

829
00:58:08,166 --> 00:58:10,666
and I'm a close personal friend
of Sherlock Holmes.

830
00:58:10,750 --> 00:58:11,750
So you claim.

831
00:58:12,833 --> 00:58:16,416
-He's never mentioned him.
-And you are not his assistant.

832
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:18,166
He doesn't have an assistant.

833
00:58:18,250 --> 00:58:20,625
Sherlock Holmes always works alone.

834
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,208
He's changed his ways
since you claim to have known him.

835
00:58:24,291 --> 00:58:26,958
-Impossible.
-Ask me three questions about him,

836
00:58:27,041 --> 00:58:30,166
and I'll ask you three, and we'll discover
who knows him best. Shall we?

837
00:58:31,541 --> 00:58:34,291
Enough! This circus is not appropriate
for Basilwether.

838
00:58:34,375 --> 00:58:36,750
She's right. Leave, both of you.

839
00:58:36,833 --> 00:58:37,791
But, madam, you know me.

840
00:58:37,875 --> 00:58:39,666
I am Lestrade, I am from Scotland Yard,

841
00:58:39,750 --> 00:58:42,291
and I'm investigating
your son's disappearance.

842
00:58:42,375 --> 00:58:45,041
-He <i>has </i>proven useful.
-Mama!

843
00:58:45,125 --> 00:58:48,666
I don't care if you're from the Houses of
Parliament. Leave this house this instant.

844
00:58:59,000 --> 00:58:59,916
Me too.

845
00:59:07,833 --> 00:59:09,208
Thank you for having me.

846
00:59:14,750 --> 00:59:16,208
His favorite tobacco?

847
00:59:16,291 --> 00:59:17,166
Black shag.

848
00:59:17,666 --> 00:59:19,291
-Favorite dessert?
-Plum pie.

849
00:59:20,041 --> 00:59:21,208
His favorite composer?

850
00:59:21,875 --> 00:59:22,791
Paganini.

851
00:59:23,541 --> 00:59:24,833
Favorite meal of the day?

852
00:59:25,666 --> 00:59:26,625
Breakfast.

853
00:59:27,791 --> 00:59:30,208
Are all your questions about food?

854
00:59:31,958 --> 00:59:33,375
His favorite case?

855
00:59:34,125 --> 00:59:35,125
The one before.

856
00:59:36,291 --> 00:59:37,416
Favorite board game?

857
00:59:41,416 --> 00:59:43,083
How do you know Sherlock Holmes?

858
00:59:43,166 --> 00:59:44,125
Chess.

859
00:59:45,666 --> 00:59:47,416
But only with a worthy opponent.

860
00:59:47,875 --> 00:59:48,750
Hmm.

861
01:00:09,166 --> 01:00:10,000
I say!

862
01:00:11,708 --> 01:00:13,083
I'll pay you five pounds...

863
01:00:13,708 --> 01:00:14,875
to swap clothes with me.

864
01:00:16,583 --> 01:00:18,916
You needn't wear my dress
if you prefer not to.

865
01:00:21,583 --> 01:00:22,500
The young master,

866
01:00:23,041 --> 01:00:24,916
he was outside a lot. Am I right?

867
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:26,625
Could never get him inside.

868
01:00:28,083 --> 01:00:29,416
Where would he go?

869
01:00:30,875 --> 01:00:31,875
The woods.

870
01:00:35,291 --> 01:00:36,375
Hey! Hey!

871
01:00:41,500 --> 01:00:44,333
Grab a book and have a seat,
and I'll be with you as soon as I'm free.

872
01:00:44,416 --> 01:00:46,875
Delightful.
Perhaps you could join me for tea.

873
01:00:48,875 --> 01:00:50,875
I advise you not to... walk away.

874
01:00:53,333 --> 01:00:55,666
And yet you walk away anyway.

875
01:00:55,750 --> 01:00:57,916
Whatever you think you know,
Sherlock Holmes,

876
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,750
please be advised that if you disturb
any of my customers--

877
01:01:00,833 --> 01:01:02,000
You'd hurt me badly?

878
01:01:02,083 --> 01:01:04,458
I am well aware of your talents,
Miss Grayston.

879
01:01:04,541 --> 01:01:06,166
The question is, what you'd risk

880
01:01:06,250 --> 01:01:08,125
if I were to advise my friends
in the government

881
01:01:08,208 --> 01:01:09,750
to take a look at this place.

882
01:01:09,833 --> 01:01:11,500
I know my brother would be delighted

883
01:01:11,583 --> 01:01:15,625
to browse your seditious, dangerous,
and extremely banned bookshelves.

884
01:01:17,958 --> 01:01:18,916
You see?

885
01:01:19,458 --> 01:01:21,041
We can both hurt each other.

886
01:01:23,166 --> 01:01:26,291
Now, please put the teapot down.
In your hands, it is a mighty weapon.

887
01:01:28,791 --> 01:01:29,791
Thank you.

888
01:01:29,875 --> 01:01:32,208
Do you have any sense
as to where my mother is?

889
01:01:32,625 --> 01:01:33,708
How did you find me?

890
01:01:33,791 --> 01:01:35,500
Letters hidden up her chimney.

891
01:01:36,208 --> 01:01:39,000
The ash on the sole of her shoe
and the coal dust led me to them.

892
01:01:41,625 --> 01:01:44,416
She always said you never missed anything.

893
01:01:44,500 --> 01:01:47,625
She needs to be home.
She has a daughter that needs her.

894
01:01:47,708 --> 01:01:51,250
Enola seems to be surviving perfectly well
on her own.

895
01:01:51,333 --> 01:01:52,541
So you've seen her?

896
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,041
-Is she safe?
-She's had company,

897
01:01:57,125 --> 01:01:58,250
a useless boy.

898
01:01:59,333 --> 01:02:01,708
But clearly,
she didn't feel like she needed him.

899
01:02:02,625 --> 01:02:04,375
Enola is on her own path,

900
01:02:04,458 --> 01:02:07,708
and so, for better or worse, is Eudoria.

901
01:02:08,250 --> 01:02:10,500
-Whatever mischief you two are--
-Mischief?!

902
01:02:11,208 --> 01:02:13,125
A poor choice of word.

903
01:02:14,041 --> 01:02:15,791
Try not to sound like your brother.

904
01:02:17,625 --> 01:02:21,375
You haven't any hope of understanding
any of this. You do know that?

905
01:02:21,458 --> 01:02:22,833
Educate me as to why.

906
01:02:23,916 --> 01:02:26,875
Because you don't know
what it is to be without power.

907
01:02:28,291 --> 01:02:29,791
Politics doesn't interest you.

908
01:02:29,875 --> 01:02:31,291
-Why?
-Because it's fatally boring.

909
01:02:31,375 --> 01:02:34,166
Because you have no interest
in changing a world

910
01:02:34,708 --> 01:02:36,958
that suits you so well.

911
01:02:38,083 --> 01:02:40,125
- A pretty speech.
- A scary one.

912
01:02:40,625 --> 01:02:43,625
You're intelligent enough to know
that every word of it is true.

913
01:02:46,333 --> 01:02:47,500
What a family!

914
01:02:48,708 --> 01:02:51,000
A lost child, a puffed-up misanthrope,

915
01:02:51,083 --> 01:02:53,833
a revolutionary, and yourself.

916
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,250
No wife, no friends,

917
01:02:57,333 --> 01:02:59,083
just a strange occupation

918
01:02:59,166 --> 01:03:01,958
obsessed with footprints and coal dust.

919
01:03:02,666 --> 01:03:04,416
You see the world so closely,

920
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:06,750
but do you see how it's changing?

921
01:03:07,916 --> 01:03:10,416
The reform bill is just the beginning.

922
01:03:11,041 --> 01:03:11,958
If it passes.

923
01:03:14,791 --> 01:03:16,958
I have to get back to work now,
Mr. Holmes.

924
01:03:17,708 --> 01:03:18,916
Customers to serve.

925
01:03:19,666 --> 01:03:20,750
Cakes to bake.

926
01:03:24,166 --> 01:03:26,208
I'm pleased you're interested, at least.

927
01:03:26,291 --> 01:03:28,750
Eudoria thought
that you'd just ignore your sister,

928
01:03:28,833 --> 01:03:30,875
like the ostrich you are.

929
01:03:33,916 --> 01:03:35,583
But I suspect that she needs you.

930
01:03:40,833 --> 01:03:42,416
So everyone keeps telling me.

931
01:03:53,875 --> 01:03:55,875
A simple shave, please, Martin.

932
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:03,916
Her name?

933
01:04:04,500 --> 01:04:06,291
May Beatrice Posy.

934
01:04:08,666 --> 01:04:09,750
<i>She looked?</i>

935
01:04:10,333 --> 01:04:12,291
<i>Small, dark, young.</i>

936
01:04:12,375 --> 01:04:14,458
- How young?
- Barely past 20.

937
01:04:15,583 --> 01:04:16,416
Hmm.

938
01:04:17,375 --> 01:04:19,708
- <i>Her mind?</i>
<i>- </i><i>Sharp as a tack.</i>

939
01:04:19,791 --> 01:04:21,083
<i>And what she knew of Sherlock...</i>

940
01:04:21,166 --> 01:04:22,583
Oh, she knew a great deal?

941
01:04:23,708 --> 01:04:24,750
As much as I.

942
01:04:25,291 --> 01:04:26,708
Oh, another sycophant.

943
01:04:26,791 --> 01:04:28,416
How very exciting.

944
01:04:29,541 --> 01:04:31,125
Will you tell me who she is?

945
01:04:31,208 --> 01:04:34,000
Do you have any sense
of where she might have gone?

946
01:04:34,083 --> 01:04:36,541
Oh, you wish to track her down.

947
01:04:36,875 --> 01:04:40,291
I've been engaged in trying to do so
for a number of days.

948
01:04:40,375 --> 01:04:42,041
Of course!

949
01:04:42,875 --> 01:04:44,125
She's your sister.

950
01:04:44,208 --> 01:04:46,041
Keep your mouth shut!

951
01:04:49,666 --> 01:04:50,666
Yes.

952
01:04:51,166 --> 01:04:54,125
And I believe I explicitly told you
to look for her.

953
01:04:54,208 --> 01:04:57,833
W-- You explicitly told me
to look for a scrappy girl with no poise.

954
01:04:57,916 --> 01:05:00,583
This was a woman with extreme poise.

955
01:05:00,666 --> 01:05:02,916
Oh, there's a wild thing
underneath,

956
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:04,250
that I assure you.

957
01:05:08,291 --> 01:05:09,208
Find her,

958
01:05:10,333 --> 01:05:11,875
and you will be well rewarded.

959
01:05:32,166 --> 01:05:35,375
A tree branch broke above me
as I was collecting wild mushrooms.

960
01:05:40,750 --> 01:05:42,083
It should have crushed me.

961
01:06:01,750 --> 01:06:02,833
Tewkesbury?

962
01:07:15,791 --> 01:07:18,000
<i>So this is where</i>
<i>you laid your plans.</i>

963
01:07:22,041 --> 01:07:24,541
{\an8}<i>Or maybe that's what</i>
<i>you wanted them to think.</i>

964
01:07:27,166 --> 01:07:28,625
<i>You were leading them astray.</i>

965
01:07:32,208 --> 01:07:34,208
This must be why Bowler Hat was there...

966
01:07:34,625 --> 01:07:37,208
...following your breadcrumb trail.

967
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:41,666
So what was your real plan?

968
01:07:48,833 --> 01:07:51,791
Oh, you tickle me, Viscount Tewkesbury,

969
01:07:52,500 --> 01:07:56,916
you magnificent
Marquess of blooming Basilwether.

970
01:07:58,291 --> 01:08:02,083
{\an8}And you're a cleverer boy
than I perhaps gave you credit for.

971
01:08:02,166 --> 01:08:04,875
{\an8}It's not as stable as you think.

972
01:08:07,083 --> 01:08:10,500
Some of those branches
are extremely capricious.

973
01:08:14,583 --> 01:08:15,541
Good morning.

974
01:08:16,458 --> 01:08:18,166
I believe we've already met,

975
01:08:18,250 --> 01:08:20,541
though you were dressed differently then.

976
01:08:21,208 --> 01:08:23,333
You'd already discovered this, hadn't you?

977
01:08:23,750 --> 01:08:25,541
We found it a few days ago.

978
01:08:26,625 --> 01:08:28,000
Would you care to come down?

979
01:08:30,541 --> 01:08:32,958
Did you see anything to report

980
01:08:33,041 --> 01:08:34,958
to your... "employer"?

981
01:08:37,458 --> 01:08:38,291
Oh.

982
01:08:39,291 --> 01:08:40,125
No.

983
01:08:41,833 --> 01:08:43,291
Sherlock. Um...

984
01:08:43,875 --> 01:08:45,708
He'll probably want to come by.

985
01:08:47,166 --> 01:08:49,583
-What did you say your name was?
-May.

986
01:08:53,875 --> 01:08:55,125
May Beatrice Posy.

987
01:08:55,875 --> 01:08:58,041
And how old are you, Miss Posy?

988
01:08:59,208 --> 01:09:00,208
Twenty-two.

989
01:09:02,750 --> 01:09:06,208
I'll have to let the gardener go
for lending you his uniform.

990
01:09:06,583 --> 01:09:07,416
No.

991
01:09:08,041 --> 01:09:08,916
No, I forced him.

992
01:09:10,291 --> 01:09:11,166
Tied him up.

993
01:09:12,333 --> 01:09:13,375
I know jujutsu.

994
01:09:18,875 --> 01:09:20,000
It's a martial art.

995
01:09:21,041 --> 01:09:23,083
You are most intriguing, Miss Posy.

996
01:09:24,833 --> 01:09:26,500
Or should I say "missus"?

997
01:09:27,291 --> 01:09:29,291
My condolences, by the way.

998
01:09:33,375 --> 01:09:34,583
Beautiful, isn't it?

999
01:09:35,416 --> 01:09:36,875
It always felt an honor to me

1000
01:09:36,958 --> 01:09:40,500
that my family was given
this part of England to protect.

1001
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:42,208
To protect?

1002
01:09:42,666 --> 01:09:45,583
That is what it is
to be an ancestral landowner.

1003
01:09:46,291 --> 01:09:49,625
As the world becomes
increasingly unstable,

1004
01:09:49,708 --> 01:09:54,458
it feels important
that these ideas of England are preserved

1005
01:09:55,500 --> 01:09:59,125
for the safety and security
of the future of our country.

1006
01:10:02,375 --> 01:10:03,541
It is lovely here.

1007
01:10:05,041 --> 01:10:07,583
But you're probably
one of those new thinkers.

1008
01:10:09,166 --> 01:10:11,375
My son was a new thinker too.

1009
01:10:11,458 --> 01:10:13,125
Never could focus on what was,

1010
01:10:13,208 --> 01:10:15,208
it was always about what could be.

1011
01:10:15,916 --> 01:10:18,291
I suspect my grandson is the same.

1012
01:10:20,500 --> 01:10:22,541
England's true glory...

1013
01:10:23,333 --> 01:10:24,625
is what is.

1014
01:10:26,083 --> 01:10:27,000
Do you see?

1015
01:10:32,833 --> 01:10:34,333
I can see much beauty.

1016
01:10:35,166 --> 01:10:36,875
Very sensible answer.

1017
01:10:38,541 --> 01:10:39,375
Now go.

1018
01:10:39,458 --> 01:10:42,958
If my son or daughter-in-law
finds you here, they'll have you arrested.

1019
01:10:45,375 --> 01:10:48,458
If you see my grandson before I do,

1020
01:10:49,750 --> 01:10:52,583
will you tell him
that I care about him a great deal?

1021
01:10:55,666 --> 01:10:56,500
I will.

1022
01:10:58,000 --> 01:10:58,875
Off you go.

1023
01:11:20,958 --> 01:11:22,333
I want four yellow flowers,

1024
01:11:22,416 --> 01:11:23,625
two blue, and a red one.

1025
01:11:23,958 --> 01:11:26,083
I don't care about the breed.
Any flower will do.

1026
01:11:27,041 --> 01:11:28,208
What are you doing here?

1027
01:11:28,666 --> 01:11:31,666
Why, if you're passionate about flowers,
would you come to London?

1028
01:11:31,750 --> 01:11:34,208
-Because I can be lost here.
-And yet I found you.

1029
01:11:35,500 --> 01:11:36,500
And why have you done so?

1030
01:11:39,541 --> 01:11:41,916
You're here for the money.
They've offered a reward.

1031
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:42,875
Have they?

1032
01:11:43,541 --> 01:11:44,750
I didn't know.

1033
01:11:46,833 --> 01:11:48,375
Well, I must tie you up and claim it!

1034
01:11:50,416 --> 01:11:52,833
Stars and garters,
are you really so ridiculous?

1035
01:11:55,041 --> 01:11:58,375
I've come here because I've grown
to like you more in your absence,

1036
01:11:58,458 --> 01:12:01,375
and because, as it turns out,
your life is still in danger.

1037
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:03,458
What's made you like me more?

1038
01:12:04,500 --> 01:12:08,875
Really? <i>That </i>is your question?
Not "Who is trying to kill me?"

1039
01:12:14,375 --> 01:12:17,291
I found your flower pressings.
They were quite beautiful.

1040
01:12:17,375 --> 01:12:19,250
I don't give a fig about flowers,
of course.

1041
01:12:19,333 --> 01:12:22,041
-That's because you're ignorant.
-Ignorant? How dare you?

1042
01:12:22,125 --> 01:12:23,833
Ignorant and willfully so.

1043
01:12:23,916 --> 01:12:26,250
-You could change your mind about a boy.
-I'm not a boy.

1044
01:12:26,333 --> 01:12:27,666
I'm a man.

1045
01:12:27,750 --> 01:12:29,875
You're a man when I tell you you're a man.

1046
01:12:30,791 --> 01:12:32,958
You do look better in breeches,
I'll give you that.

1047
01:12:34,583 --> 01:12:36,083
I've missed you, Enola Holmes.

1048
01:12:36,541 --> 01:12:37,750
I wanted to miss you,

1049
01:12:38,500 --> 01:12:40,500
but I kept getting dragged back
towards you.

1050
01:12:40,583 --> 01:12:43,750
Now, come on. We're in serious danger,
if you didn't know.

1051
01:12:54,875 --> 01:12:58,250
-Is this how you're living?
-Did you just rent a room at the Ritz?

1052
01:12:58,916 --> 01:13:01,833
I afforded myself
a shade more comfort than this.

1053
01:13:02,583 --> 01:13:05,083
Well, the woman I boarded off
assured me this was a fine room.

1054
01:13:05,166 --> 01:13:06,041
Mmm.

1055
01:13:07,041 --> 01:13:08,750
The woman you boarded off lied.

1056
01:13:13,833 --> 01:13:16,916
I have but a single bed,
so you'll have to sleep on the floor.

1057
01:13:20,791 --> 01:13:22,000
You keep old newspapers?

1058
01:13:22,083 --> 01:13:25,041
Be careful with that.
I haven't finished reading it yet.

1059
01:13:25,541 --> 01:13:26,958
Oh. I'm in this one.

1060
01:13:27,583 --> 01:13:28,708
-So you are.
-Look.

1061
01:13:34,375 --> 01:13:37,083
Why do you keep all these old newspapers,
Enola Holmes?

1062
01:13:40,750 --> 01:13:41,583
My mother.

1063
01:13:42,916 --> 01:13:45,500
I'm waiting for her to leave me a message.

1064
01:13:46,583 --> 01:13:48,625
-She hasn't yet.
-"Message"? What...

1065
01:13:49,041 --> 01:13:50,375
She likes ciphers.

1066
01:13:51,833 --> 01:13:54,166
Coded messages that need to be deciphered.

1067
01:13:55,250 --> 01:13:57,500
And why would she leave you a message?

1068
01:14:00,833 --> 01:14:01,958
Because she left me.

1069
01:14:05,250 --> 01:14:06,875
And I thought she meant
for me to find her,

1070
01:14:06,958 --> 01:14:08,416
but I'm not sure she did now.

1071
01:14:09,625 --> 01:14:12,250
So I left her a message,
and I'm hopeful of a reply.

1072
01:14:13,791 --> 01:14:15,500
I keep the newspapers to check.

1073
01:14:19,125 --> 01:14:20,041
I got it.

1074
01:14:25,125 --> 01:14:26,541
Don't look at me like that.

1075
01:14:27,583 --> 01:14:28,541
I'm sorry.

1076
01:14:29,375 --> 01:14:30,958
I don't want your pity, Tewkesbury.

1077
01:14:35,583 --> 01:14:37,458
If you don't stop looking at me like that,

1078
01:14:37,541 --> 01:14:40,666
Viscount Irritation,
Marquess of Bothersomeshire,

1079
01:14:40,750 --> 01:14:42,291
I'll murder you myself.

1080
01:14:44,500 --> 01:14:46,708
People don't seem to want us, do they?

1081
01:14:49,916 --> 01:14:50,750
No.

1082
01:14:52,291 --> 01:14:54,958
Still, at least we've got each other.

1083
01:15:02,458 --> 01:15:03,583
I'll make us some tea.

1084
01:15:07,708 --> 01:15:10,166
So you genuinely believe
my life's in danger?

1085
01:15:11,458 --> 01:15:12,666
Uh, from whom?

1086
01:15:12,750 --> 01:15:15,333
-Your past and your future.
-Whatever does that mean?

1087
01:15:15,416 --> 01:15:17,791
Your family. They didn't send
a detective to find you.

1088
01:15:17,875 --> 01:15:21,041
They could have, and they didn't.
Instead, they sent a murderer.

1089
01:15:21,958 --> 01:15:23,625
Why would anyone
want me dead?

1090
01:15:23,708 --> 01:15:25,041
Countless reasons.

1091
01:15:26,333 --> 01:15:29,625
Your personality, your ridiculous hair,
your silly smile,

1092
01:15:29,708 --> 01:15:32,791
or possibly your land, your estate,
your title, your seat.

1093
01:15:32,875 --> 01:15:34,791
Same reasons they wanted your father dead.

1094
01:15:34,875 --> 01:15:36,875
Greed does funny things to people,
Tewkesbury.

1095
01:15:36,958 --> 01:15:39,500
So now you're saying
you think they killed my father?

1096
01:15:39,583 --> 01:15:40,708
I don't think.

1097
01:15:42,333 --> 01:15:43,291
I know.

1098
01:15:43,375 --> 01:15:45,666
No. No, none of this
makes the slightest sense.

1099
01:15:45,750 --> 01:15:48,083
My father's death was caused
by a botched burglary,

1100
01:15:48,166 --> 01:15:50,750
and-- and it would have been easier
to kill me before I ran away,

1101
01:15:50,833 --> 01:15:53,166
-rather than now--
-I entirely agree. I think they tried to.

1102
01:15:53,250 --> 01:15:55,125
I found the branch that almost killed you.

1103
01:15:55,208 --> 01:15:57,000
-It had been cut.
-Cut?

1104
01:15:57,083 --> 01:15:58,583
Better you--

1105
01:15:58,666 --> 01:16:00,541
Oh, gosh! Oh!

1106
01:16:01,541 --> 01:16:02,916
- Oh, gosh, you...
- Come on!

1107
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,208
- Come back here!
- Who's he?

1108
01:16:06,250 --> 01:16:08,500
-Didn't you get her, Inspector?
-Shut up, you!

1109
01:16:09,166 --> 01:16:10,666
Move the chest! Move the chest!

1110
01:16:10,750 --> 01:16:12,250
Where are they?

1111
01:16:13,541 --> 01:16:15,333
Open up, Miss Posy,

1112
01:16:15,416 --> 01:16:18,125
or should I say Miss Holmes?

1113
01:16:18,208 --> 01:16:21,333
Inspector Lestrade,
I need to report an attempted murder.

1114
01:16:21,416 --> 01:16:22,958
You're supposed to be on our side.

1115
01:16:25,166 --> 01:16:26,916
Help me get in through this door.

1116
01:16:27,333 --> 01:16:29,791
Well, I'll help you when I get my money,
my finder's fee.

1117
01:16:29,875 --> 01:16:32,375
You'll get your money when we catch her.
Come on!

1118
01:16:32,916 --> 01:16:34,458
See that window over there?

1119
01:16:35,416 --> 01:16:36,833
It leads onto a roof.

1120
01:16:36,916 --> 01:16:39,500
I need you to climb out
and take off into nowhere.

1121
01:16:39,583 --> 01:16:40,416
And leave you?

1122
01:16:40,500 --> 01:16:41,875
I need to hold this door!

1123
01:16:41,958 --> 01:16:43,833
But you need to get away too!

1124
01:16:43,916 --> 01:16:45,791
If he catches you,
your life will be in danger.

1125
01:16:45,875 --> 01:16:49,541
If he catches me,
it's simply a life I do not want. Now go.

1126
01:16:50,416 --> 01:16:52,083
I don't want to leave you, Enola.

1127
01:16:54,750 --> 01:16:55,916
Go!

1128
01:16:56,250 --> 01:16:57,166
Go!

1129
01:17:14,166 --> 01:17:15,708
Help me <i>now!</i>

1130
01:17:16,125 --> 01:17:17,208
Useless men!

1131
01:17:21,791 --> 01:17:23,375
No!

1132
01:17:27,708 --> 01:17:29,000
He's worth more,

1133
01:17:29,583 --> 01:17:31,333
but you give me greater pleasure.

1134
01:17:46,125 --> 01:17:47,625
<i>You may not like me.</i>

1135
01:17:48,708 --> 01:17:50,833
You may not think what I'm doing is right.

1136
01:17:51,250 --> 01:17:53,750
But even your blessed mother made a match.

1137
01:17:54,541 --> 01:17:56,416
Even your blessed mother was a bride.

1138
01:17:59,458 --> 01:18:00,916
I want you to be happy.

1139
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:01,833
No.

1140
01:18:04,375 --> 01:18:06,083
You want <i>you </i>to be happy.

1141
01:18:06,791 --> 01:18:08,125
You want me controlled.

1142
01:18:08,541 --> 01:18:11,208
Because otherwise you think
I will affect your standing.

1143
01:18:11,291 --> 01:18:13,333
You already have done immense damage.

1144
01:18:14,666 --> 01:18:16,833
As has that errant brother of ours.

1145
01:18:18,416 --> 01:18:20,333
Let me out of this carriage.

1146
01:18:21,583 --> 01:18:24,375
I will deny I am your sister
to whoever asks,

1147
01:18:24,458 --> 01:18:26,625
and I will do it with pleasure.

1148
01:18:26,708 --> 01:18:29,083
You are my ward!

1149
01:18:29,166 --> 01:18:31,291
And you will do as you are told!

1150
01:18:42,541 --> 01:18:43,958
Now, hand it over.

1151
01:18:45,083 --> 01:18:46,541
It is my money, after all.

1152
01:18:55,375 --> 01:18:56,708
Good girl.

1153
01:19:08,041 --> 01:19:11,625
You've missed supper, but no matter.
You could do with losing a pound or two.

1154
01:19:16,416 --> 01:19:18,791
The name Holmes

1155
01:19:18,875 --> 01:19:21,125
is coming to mean something
in this country.

1156
01:19:21,208 --> 01:19:23,708
At this school,
you'll be given a chance to live up to it.

1157
01:19:23,791 --> 01:19:26,250
-But I--
-And you can begin by closing your mouth.

1158
01:19:26,958 --> 01:19:30,875
The next time you meet your brothers,
they will have reason to be proud of you.

1159
01:19:32,541 --> 01:19:33,416
Welcome.

1160
01:19:37,041 --> 01:19:38,083
<i>Girls,</i>

1161
01:19:38,166 --> 01:19:40,416
<i>you are here for one reason...</i>

1162
01:19:40,500 --> 01:19:42,375
<i>...and one reason only.</i>

1163
01:19:43,166 --> 01:19:46,291
<i>You are here to be made into young ladies.</i>

1164
01:19:46,375 --> 01:19:47,500
<i>How do we laugh?</i>

1165
01:19:47,583 --> 01:19:48,958
We laugh politely.

1166
01:19:49,333 --> 01:19:50,333
Ha, ha, ha.

1167
01:19:50,833 --> 01:19:52,041
Ha, ha, ha.

1168
01:19:52,541 --> 01:19:54,500
<i>You all have the potential,</i>

1169
01:19:55,250 --> 01:19:57,666
<i>but you are untapped,</i>

1170
01:19:58,208 --> 01:19:59,750
<i>untested...</i>

1171
01:19:59,833 --> 01:20:02,875
<i>...and most of all, untrained.</i>

1172
01:20:03,416 --> 01:20:05,333
<i>Walk as we show you to.</i>

1173
01:20:05,416 --> 01:20:07,250
Eyes up! Up, up, up!

1174
01:20:07,708 --> 01:20:10,208
<i>Speak as we tell you to.</i>

1175
01:20:10,291 --> 01:20:13,708
What whim led white Whitney to whittle?

1176
01:20:14,250 --> 01:20:17,916
What whim led white Whitney
to whittle?

1177
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:21,625
<i>Act, think, be as we tell you,</i>

1178
01:20:22,041 --> 01:20:24,583
<i>and you'll become acceptable wives</i>

1179
01:20:25,041 --> 01:20:26,875
<i>and responsible mothers.</i>

1180
01:20:31,833 --> 01:20:34,375
<i> Follow the path</i>
<i>of so many girls</i>

1181
01:20:34,458 --> 01:20:36,833
<i>who once stood where you do now.</i>

1182
01:20:36,916 --> 01:20:39,166
<i>And just as we molded them...</i>

1183
01:20:42,750 --> 01:20:45,541
<i>...so shall we you.</i>

1184
01:20:52,625 --> 01:20:54,875
Do you know why
I am an educator?

1185
01:20:55,791 --> 01:20:57,875
It's because I want to make people happy.

1186
01:20:58,791 --> 01:21:01,666
I want you to live
a full and vibrant life.

1187
01:21:02,416 --> 01:21:05,791
Not with anger and endless questions,
but with answers.

1188
01:21:05,875 --> 01:21:07,833
I prepare my girls for the world,

1189
01:21:07,916 --> 01:21:10,166
for the <i>real </i>world.

1190
01:21:12,458 --> 01:21:13,666
I would never abandon you...

1191
01:21:15,083 --> 01:21:16,833
and leave you to fend for yourself.

1192
01:21:19,666 --> 01:21:20,500
Yes.

1193
01:21:21,666 --> 01:21:22,666
Mycroft told me.

1194
01:21:24,708 --> 01:21:26,208
My mother had her reasons.

1195
01:21:26,916 --> 01:21:28,083
I'm sure she did.

1196
01:21:30,875 --> 01:21:31,916
I knew your mother.

1197
01:21:33,666 --> 01:21:35,166
We were friends for a while.

1198
01:21:36,333 --> 01:21:37,208
At school.

1199
01:21:38,583 --> 01:21:40,208
She was a peculiar little thing.

1200
01:21:40,583 --> 01:21:42,875
Was always unpredictable,
always challenging.

1201
01:21:43,625 --> 01:21:46,458
She never truly cared for anything
except her own...

1202
01:21:47,166 --> 01:21:48,541
unusual ideas.

1203
01:21:49,750 --> 01:21:51,083
She cared for <i>me.</i>

1204
01:21:53,958 --> 01:21:55,333
Then why did she leave you?

1205
01:22:02,208 --> 01:22:04,708
Prefects will accompany you
to and from lessons.

1206
01:22:04,791 --> 01:22:06,833
This door will always be kept locked.

1207
01:22:08,958 --> 01:22:09,958
You'll thank me...

1208
01:22:10,541 --> 01:22:11,583
one day,

1209
01:22:11,666 --> 01:22:14,541
when you're happily married
with a pair of strapping boys.

1210
01:22:16,458 --> 01:22:18,291
Sleep well, Enola.

1211
01:22:36,208 --> 01:22:38,666
<i> Your brother's here.</i>
<i>Smart collar.</i>

1212
01:22:44,958 --> 01:22:45,958
Mr. Holmes.

1213
01:22:51,375 --> 01:22:52,208
You.

1214
01:22:54,125 --> 01:22:55,416
Thank you, Miss Harrison.

1215
01:22:57,791 --> 01:22:58,625
Oh.

1216
01:22:59,333 --> 01:23:00,166
Of course.

1217
01:23:06,125 --> 01:23:09,000
I have never seen
such a range of romances in my life.

1218
01:23:09,708 --> 01:23:11,625
It's enough to turn you to newspapers.

1219
01:23:14,666 --> 01:23:16,541
What in heaven's are you looking for?

1220
01:23:18,208 --> 01:23:21,083
Why might you be interested
in the personals? You've gone quite mad.

1221
01:23:21,666 --> 01:23:24,166
I have a right to be mad
in a place like this.

1222
01:23:25,791 --> 01:23:27,875
I was forced into calligraphy as a child.

1223
01:23:28,458 --> 01:23:29,291
Ah.

1224
01:23:30,833 --> 01:23:32,625
Hated it, but there's rarely a case

1225
01:23:32,708 --> 01:23:35,541
where someone's handwriting
doesn't tell me something I need to know.

1226
01:23:35,625 --> 01:23:37,916
And what might I learn from deportment?

1227
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:42,166
The way a person stands
may disguise who they are.

1228
01:23:43,208 --> 01:23:44,125
Nothing's wasted.

1229
01:23:45,458 --> 01:23:46,500
Have you found her?

1230
01:23:47,250 --> 01:23:48,833
No, not yet.

1231
01:23:49,333 --> 01:23:52,583
I went to the tearooms,
where Edith threatened me with a teapot.

1232
01:23:55,083 --> 01:23:56,250
And to Limehouse.

1233
01:23:58,166 --> 01:23:59,750
I believe you went there too.

1234
01:24:04,333 --> 01:24:06,416
You've become quite the detective, Enola.

1235
01:24:08,041 --> 01:24:09,333
Did you find the gunpowder?

1236
01:24:09,416 --> 01:24:10,750
-And the bombs?
-I did.

1237
01:24:12,625 --> 01:24:14,583
- Why would she--
-I shudder to think.

1238
01:24:17,375 --> 01:24:19,333
Perhaps she wants to change the world.

1239
01:24:21,791 --> 01:24:23,875
Perhaps it's a world that needs changing.

1240
01:24:27,875 --> 01:24:28,791
Will you stop her?

1241
01:24:29,291 --> 01:24:31,041
I don't get involved in politics.

1242
01:24:32,291 --> 01:24:34,458
Or people, either, unless they're clues.

1243
01:24:36,291 --> 01:24:37,958
-Did you help Mycroft catch me?
-No.

1244
01:24:38,041 --> 01:24:40,250
But you found out about the money.
You told him.

1245
01:24:40,333 --> 01:24:43,333
You disappeared.
We had to know how far you would run.

1246
01:24:43,416 --> 01:24:45,458
I'm just a case to you, aren't I?

1247
01:24:45,541 --> 01:24:48,375
A curiosity. Is that why you're here,
to pick my brains?

1248
01:24:48,458 --> 01:24:50,750
-No.
-Or possibly you're feeling guilty.

1249
01:24:50,833 --> 01:24:52,458
I'm here because I care for you.

1250
01:24:57,583 --> 01:24:58,916
You're being emotional.

1251
01:25:00,833 --> 01:25:02,583
It's understandable, but unnecessary.

1252
01:25:11,958 --> 01:25:14,625
- It's an intrigue, isn't it?
- Emotion?

1253
01:25:15,416 --> 01:25:16,541
The Tewkesbury case.

1254
01:25:18,666 --> 01:25:21,166
A bit more complicated
than a simple disappearance.

1255
01:25:22,083 --> 01:25:23,458
He jumped from the train...

1256
01:25:24,625 --> 01:25:25,625
with another boy.

1257
01:25:27,250 --> 01:25:28,833
Were they being chased, do you think?

1258
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:31,125
How did you know that?

1259
01:25:31,583 --> 01:25:34,666
I traced your departure
to the same station that he left from.

1260
01:25:35,500 --> 01:25:38,333
Edith mentioned "a useless boy."

1261
01:25:40,083 --> 01:25:44,458
And I was telegrammed
about a young female assistant of mine

1262
01:25:44,833 --> 01:25:46,750
who visited the Tewkesbury residence.

1263
01:25:49,750 --> 01:25:50,875
Have you solved it?

1264
01:25:53,208 --> 01:25:54,041
Not yet.

1265
01:25:55,125 --> 01:25:56,875
The only advice I can give to you,

1266
01:25:58,333 --> 01:25:59,750
one detective to another,

1267
01:26:01,875 --> 01:26:04,250
sometimes you must dangle your feet
in the water

1268
01:26:04,625 --> 01:26:06,208
in order to attract the sharks.

1269
01:26:07,500 --> 01:26:09,000
So that's why you came here.

1270
01:26:10,250 --> 01:26:11,375
Shark lessons.

1271
01:26:13,125 --> 01:26:13,958
No, no.

1272
01:26:16,125 --> 01:26:17,416
I came here...

1273
01:26:17,500 --> 01:26:18,375
to give you this.

1274
01:26:28,500 --> 01:26:29,958
I found it under her pillow.

1275
01:26:31,208 --> 01:26:32,333
She kept it, you see.

1276
01:26:33,125 --> 01:26:34,000
Dash...

1277
01:26:34,625 --> 01:26:36,500
Sentimental, really, but she always did...

1278
01:26:38,458 --> 01:26:40,791
She always found you quite extraordinary.

1279
01:26:47,041 --> 01:26:49,125
As do I, Enola Holmes.

1280
01:26:56,041 --> 01:26:57,583
The choice is always yours.

1281
01:26:58,833 --> 01:27:00,750
Whatever society may claim,

1282
01:27:01,625 --> 01:27:02,750
it can't control you.

1283
01:27:04,916 --> 01:27:06,250
As Mother has proven.

1284
01:27:10,083 --> 01:27:11,041
Keep the paper.

1285
01:27:40,250 --> 01:27:42,375
<i>Mother thought</i>
<i>I was extraordinary.</i>

1286
01:27:44,041 --> 01:27:45,958
Extraordinary...

1287
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:02,250
The Lords...

1288
01:28:10,208 --> 01:28:11,125
Lord.

1289
01:28:14,500 --> 01:28:16,458
"Every vote counts."

1290
01:28:24,750 --> 01:28:26,166
Delivery from Ferndell Hall.

1291
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:30,583
Care of Mr. Mycroft Holmes.

1292
01:28:32,125 --> 01:28:33,708
What does he want?

1293
01:28:33,791 --> 01:28:35,541
Well... whatever it is,

1294
01:28:36,083 --> 01:28:37,000
it's heavy.

1295
01:28:40,916 --> 01:28:43,333
What on earth does Mycroft want?

1296
01:28:53,291 --> 01:28:54,125
Ow!

1297
01:28:56,875 --> 01:28:58,041
Tewkesbury!

1298
01:28:58,416 --> 01:28:59,458
Whoa!

1299
01:29:01,041 --> 01:29:04,041
You're supposed to be helping me out,
not getting in with me.

1300
01:29:05,375 --> 01:29:08,291
-How did you find me?
-Well, you said you didn't want to come

1301
01:29:08,375 --> 01:29:10,625
to Miss Harrison's Finishing School
for Young Ladies.

1302
01:29:11,083 --> 01:29:13,458
I have quite the prodigious memory
when I choose to use it.

1303
01:29:14,833 --> 01:29:17,125
So I thought we'd go out
the same way I came in.

1304
01:29:17,208 --> 01:29:18,083
Huh.

1305
01:29:18,916 --> 01:29:20,666
I even wore my most porter-ish coat.

1306
01:29:21,708 --> 01:29:23,375
That's an excellent idea!

1307
01:29:25,375 --> 01:29:27,291
Nope! Nope, nope, nope. Help me up.

1308
01:29:27,375 --> 01:29:30,250
Miss Harrison,
she will see right through you.

1309
01:29:31,041 --> 01:29:34,333
- Oh! I knew there was a flaw!
- Shh. Let me think.

1310
01:29:37,458 --> 01:29:38,625
Do you have any ideas?

1311
01:29:47,083 --> 01:29:48,333
Quiet!

1312
01:29:59,125 --> 01:30:00,375
Stop there.

1313
01:30:02,250 --> 01:30:03,458
Who are you?

1314
01:30:04,291 --> 01:30:06,375
Have you permission to be in this school?

1315
01:30:07,041 --> 01:30:07,916
Um...

1316
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,041
I was just delivering a package, miss.

1317
01:30:11,291 --> 01:30:12,666
Um, to the headmistress.

1318
01:30:14,958 --> 01:30:17,166
Could you please direct me to her office?

1319
01:30:18,666 --> 01:30:20,916
I am the headmistress of the school.

1320
01:30:24,458 --> 01:30:26,625
Well, then, um, this is for you.

1321
01:30:28,541 --> 01:30:30,291
Well, open it up.
Let me see what's inside.

1322
01:30:30,375 --> 01:30:32,333
Oh, I can't, miss.
I was given express instructions

1323
01:30:32,416 --> 01:30:33,708
that this be opened in private.

1324
01:30:33,791 --> 01:30:36,333
-Oh, how ridiculous.
-By my employer, miss.

1325
01:30:36,416 --> 01:30:38,125
And who might that be?

1326
01:30:39,083 --> 01:30:40,041
Mycroft Holmes.

1327
01:30:43,041 --> 01:30:44,000
Mycroft Holmes...

1328
01:30:48,875 --> 01:30:49,916
Girls...

1329
01:30:50,416 --> 01:30:54,166
Would you just take this parcel
into my office

1330
01:30:54,541 --> 01:30:56,541
that I might open it later?

1331
01:31:00,083 --> 01:31:02,125
- No dilly-dallying.
- Ouch!

1332
01:31:02,208 --> 01:31:03,833
Oh, this weighs a ton!

1333
01:31:06,166 --> 01:31:09,250
-Why is it so heavy?
-So, what are you waiting for? A tip?

1334
01:31:10,416 --> 01:31:12,458
Go on, begone.

1335
01:31:56,916 --> 01:31:59,916
- Can you actually drive this?
- I know the basic rudiments.

1336
01:32:06,458 --> 01:32:07,416
My automobile!

1337
01:32:07,500 --> 01:32:09,208
Left, right, watch out, Enola!

1338
01:32:09,291 --> 01:32:10,875
- Oh, no!
- The bush!

1339
01:32:11,166 --> 01:32:12,875
- Whoo-hoo!
- Enola!

1340
01:32:12,958 --> 01:32:17,083
I'm not finished yet!

1341
01:32:20,833 --> 01:32:23,125
Thank you. That was, uh...

1342
01:32:23,708 --> 01:32:24,833
You did save me.

1343
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,375
The best bit was my idea,
but you did save me.

1344
01:32:29,458 --> 01:32:30,958
You're welcome. I think.

1345
01:32:31,458 --> 01:32:32,791
I didn't like it in there.

1346
01:32:33,791 --> 01:32:35,375
No. No, of course not.

1347
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:40,458
Now, let's get back to London
and find a proper hiding place.

1348
01:32:48,500 --> 01:32:50,000
Why have we stopped?

1349
01:32:53,333 --> 01:32:55,041
Enola, whatever you're planning...

1350
01:32:55,708 --> 01:32:57,041
<i>There'll come a time</i>

1351
01:32:57,416 --> 01:32:59,583
when you have to make a hard choice.

1352
01:33:00,083 --> 01:33:02,625
- Enola...
<i>- And, in that moment,</i>

1353
01:33:02,708 --> 01:33:05,500
<i>you will discover</i>
<i>what mettle you truly have,</i>

1354
01:33:06,666 --> 01:33:08,625
and what you're prepared to risk,

1355
01:33:09,500 --> 01:33:10,750
for what matters.

1356
01:33:12,500 --> 01:33:14,416
Your move, Enola.

1357
01:33:20,500 --> 01:33:22,125
We need to go to Basilwether.

1358
01:33:22,208 --> 01:33:23,041
What?!

1359
01:33:23,541 --> 01:33:26,625
An injustice has occurred.
It's time to right some wrongs.

1360
01:33:27,333 --> 01:33:29,166
You want a culprit, find the motive.

1361
01:33:31,041 --> 01:33:32,875
-I don't understand.
-When were you due

1362
01:33:32,958 --> 01:33:35,666
-to be inducted into the Lords?
-I'm Viscount Tewkesbury.

1363
01:33:35,750 --> 01:33:37,833
-Well, he's a bloomin' marquess.
-Imminently.

1364
01:33:37,916 --> 01:33:40,583
-How would you have voted on the bill?
-Votes for all men!

1365
01:33:40,666 --> 01:33:43,666
-The same as my father. I'd be for it.
-Who knew that?

1366
01:33:43,750 --> 01:33:44,750
I had these ideas,

1367
01:33:44,833 --> 01:33:47,583
<i>but my family were set on me</i>
<i>joining the army and going overseas.</i>

1368
01:33:47,666 --> 01:33:50,666
And who stands to gain the estate
with your father dead and if you die?

1369
01:33:52,166 --> 01:33:53,000
My uncle.

1370
01:33:53,083 --> 01:33:55,708
My sister-in-law
has all the help she needs. Show her out.

1371
01:33:55,791 --> 01:33:57,333
You think this is my uncle's doing?

1372
01:33:58,541 --> 01:33:59,541
Doesn't it make sense?

1373
01:34:01,291 --> 01:34:03,916
<i>But he's a powerful man.</i>
<i>What on earth could we do?</i>

1374
01:34:04,375 --> 01:34:05,875
Solve the crime, of course.

1375
01:34:06,500 --> 01:34:09,416
Enola, we are both extremely lucky
to have lived this long,

1376
01:34:09,500 --> 01:34:12,416
and you want to drive us into a place
where there is most certain danger?

1377
01:34:12,500 --> 01:34:14,083
Sometimes, Lord Tewkesbury,

1378
01:34:14,166 --> 01:34:17,083
you have to dangle your legs in the water
to attract the bloody sharks!

1379
01:34:17,166 --> 01:34:19,500
Why would we want to attract
the bloody sharks?

1380
01:34:20,916 --> 01:34:22,083
Good point.

1381
01:34:26,916 --> 01:34:28,791
<i>This is a terrible idea.</i>

1382
01:34:28,875 --> 01:34:31,208
<i>The closer we get,</i>
<i>the worse this idea becomes.</i>

1383
01:34:32,166 --> 01:34:33,291
Why are we doing this?

1384
01:34:35,666 --> 01:34:38,833
Unlike most well-bred ladies,
I was never taught to embroider.

1385
01:34:38,916 --> 01:34:41,958
I never molded wax roses,
hemmed handkerchiefs,

1386
01:34:42,041 --> 01:34:43,500
or strung seashells.

1387
01:34:43,583 --> 01:34:47,250
I was taught to watch and listen.
I was taught to fight.

1388
01:34:47,333 --> 01:34:49,083
This is what my mother made me for.

1389
01:34:50,791 --> 01:34:51,666
Trust me...

1390
01:34:52,416 --> 01:34:53,958
to find the answers we need.

1391
01:34:55,500 --> 01:34:57,250
You don't know how to embroider?

1392
01:34:59,833 --> 01:35:00,791
We need to do this.

1393
01:35:00,875 --> 01:35:03,875
You need to do this. We... are doing this.

1394
01:35:08,958 --> 01:35:09,791
Come on.

1395
01:35:24,458 --> 01:35:25,833
Where are all the servants?

1396
01:35:26,541 --> 01:35:27,875
Welcome to the future.

1397
01:35:33,625 --> 01:35:34,583
Mother?

1398
01:35:48,333 --> 01:35:49,291
What's happening?

1399
01:35:51,541 --> 01:35:52,750
They know we're here.

1400
01:35:57,208 --> 01:35:58,625
Down!

1401
01:36:03,875 --> 01:36:05,041
Run!

1402
01:36:09,958 --> 01:36:10,791
It's locked!

1403
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:18,083
Down!

1404
01:37:01,041 --> 01:37:02,208
Stay here.

1405
01:37:59,875 --> 01:38:01,208
Aah!

1406
01:38:46,541 --> 01:38:47,500
<i>Enola?</i>

1407
01:38:49,458 --> 01:38:50,666
<i>Don't be scared.</i>

1408
01:38:51,875 --> 01:38:53,000
<i>Enola...</i>

1409
01:38:55,833 --> 01:38:57,041
You're not alone.

1410
01:39:02,291 --> 01:39:03,625
<i>You're not alone.</i>

1411
01:39:40,625 --> 01:39:42,500
Who are you working for?

1412
01:39:43,625 --> 01:39:45,000
Who do you work for?

1413
01:39:48,333 --> 01:39:49,541
England.

1414
01:40:21,500 --> 01:40:22,708
Grandmother?

1415
01:40:23,041 --> 01:40:24,041
Yes.

1416
01:40:24,958 --> 01:40:26,250
I'm afraid so.

1417
01:40:28,541 --> 01:40:30,583
It seems if you want a job done,

1418
01:40:32,625 --> 01:40:34,291
you have to do it yourself.

1419
01:40:34,375 --> 01:40:35,375
No, Enola.

1420
01:40:37,291 --> 01:40:38,541
Where's my mother?

1421
01:40:40,583 --> 01:40:41,583
In London.

1422
01:40:43,708 --> 01:40:44,791
With your uncle.

1423
01:40:46,500 --> 01:40:47,500
Looking for you.

1424
01:40:50,541 --> 01:40:52,083
They never understood.

1425
01:40:54,958 --> 01:40:56,541
I'm so sorry, my darling.

1426
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,875
The future of the country is at stake.

1427
01:41:02,958 --> 01:41:04,125
No!

1428
01:41:21,500 --> 01:41:22,458
It's done.

1429
01:41:24,083 --> 01:41:25,125
It's done.

1430
01:41:36,791 --> 01:41:37,750
Tewkesbury!

1431
01:41:39,208 --> 01:41:40,583
Tewkesbury!

1432
01:41:41,583 --> 01:41:42,875
No!

1433
01:41:43,250 --> 01:41:44,166
Tewkesbury!

1434
01:41:46,458 --> 01:41:47,833
Wake up. Come on.

1435
01:41:48,583 --> 01:41:49,708
No...

1436
01:41:51,916 --> 01:41:52,791
No!

1437
01:42:17,750 --> 01:42:18,666
Tewkesbury?

1438
01:42:22,875 --> 01:42:23,791
Be careful.

1439
01:42:24,250 --> 01:42:25,458
Be careful.

1440
01:42:27,500 --> 01:42:29,541
I'm not entirely an idiot, you know.

1441
01:42:40,833 --> 01:42:42,333
You were made to fight.

1442
01:43:15,666 --> 01:43:16,875
Your time is over.

1443
01:43:39,333 --> 01:43:41,125
- I was really quite shocked.
- Yep.

1444
01:43:41,416 --> 01:43:42,791
-Sir?
-Don't be ridiculous.

1445
01:43:44,500 --> 01:43:45,500
Lestrade?

1446
01:43:46,291 --> 01:43:47,916
- Lestrade.
- Ah...

1447
01:43:49,500 --> 01:43:51,083
Sherlock Holmes.

1448
01:43:51,791 --> 01:43:53,666
-We meet again.
-Please.

1449
01:43:59,250 --> 01:44:02,166
You've been building
quite a reputation for yourself,

1450
01:44:02,250 --> 01:44:03,958
despite your best efforts

1451
01:44:04,041 --> 01:44:05,708
-to avoid the press.
-The marquess case.

1452
01:44:05,791 --> 01:44:08,041
You need to arrest his grandmother,
the Dowager.

1453
01:44:08,791 --> 01:44:10,041
She's trying to kill him,

1454
01:44:10,583 --> 01:44:11,833
as she killed his father.

1455
01:44:13,333 --> 01:44:14,250
Two questions.

1456
01:44:14,875 --> 01:44:16,500
How did you arrive at that conclusion?

1457
01:44:18,625 --> 01:44:22,208
It's a question of divided loyalty
and succession.

1458
01:44:22,750 --> 01:44:26,083
With the boy dead, the uncle would take
the vacant seat in the Lords

1459
01:44:26,166 --> 01:44:29,000
and stand against the reform bill
and the extension of the vote,

1460
01:44:29,083 --> 01:44:31,625
just as the Dowager wanted.

1461
01:44:32,583 --> 01:44:34,708
The boy, I deduce, would not,
nor would his father have.

1462
01:44:35,916 --> 01:44:38,833
So why would it not be the uncle himself
that did the deed?

1463
01:44:39,583 --> 01:44:40,833
To the father or the son?

1464
01:44:41,958 --> 01:44:42,791
Father?

1465
01:44:45,291 --> 01:44:48,750
His uniform in the press photographs.

1466
01:44:48,833 --> 01:44:49,666
Oh.

1467
01:44:50,125 --> 01:44:51,833
The medals on his chest.

1468
01:44:51,916 --> 01:44:54,791
He wasn't in the country
when the boy's father was killed,

1469
01:44:55,833 --> 01:44:58,541
rather serving in the Afghan War.

1470
01:45:00,666 --> 01:45:02,291
It's always there, the truth.

1471
01:45:02,375 --> 01:45:03,208
Yeah.

1472
01:45:04,916 --> 01:45:06,375
You just need to look for it.

1473
01:45:07,166 --> 01:45:08,541
Second question.

1474
01:45:10,958 --> 01:45:13,333
How did your sister get there before ya?

1475
01:45:15,583 --> 01:45:16,500
I'm sorry?

1476
01:45:24,791 --> 01:45:25,625
Ha!

1477
01:45:37,416 --> 01:45:38,458
I look fine.

1478
01:45:38,541 --> 01:45:40,458
Don't fuss over him, Caroline.

1479
01:45:40,541 --> 01:45:42,125
-Please, Mother.
-Oh, can I just--

1480
01:45:42,208 --> 01:45:44,666
Don't. I'm trying to have
these men's respect.

1481
01:45:45,875 --> 01:45:47,541
It's quite the style, you know.

1482
01:45:47,625 --> 01:45:50,458
Yes. I suppose
it sets your face off nicely.

1483
01:45:52,958 --> 01:45:54,791
Your father would be very proud of you.

1484
01:46:09,583 --> 01:46:13,250
Congratulations. You finally look
like the nincompoop you were born to be.

1485
01:46:14,958 --> 01:46:16,333
No.

1486
01:46:16,791 --> 01:46:17,833
You look good.

1487
01:46:18,583 --> 01:46:19,875
This is... good.

1488
01:46:20,625 --> 01:46:23,458
The vote is in an hour. It's, um...
It's quite the thing.

1489
01:46:24,916 --> 01:46:27,958
I'm not supposed to bow or anything, am I,
now that you are whatever you are?

1490
01:46:28,041 --> 01:46:30,208
Well, arguably, you always had to bow.

1491
01:46:30,291 --> 01:46:32,208
You just... chose not to.

1492
01:46:35,083 --> 01:46:36,916
So, uh, are you safe? Are you...

1493
01:46:37,291 --> 01:46:38,666
Are you-- are you comfortable?

1494
01:46:39,625 --> 01:46:40,583
You're not still living

1495
01:46:40,666 --> 01:46:42,916
- in that terrible lodgings house, are you?
- No.

1496
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:44,791
I used the reward money
your mother gave me...

1497
01:46:44,875 --> 01:46:47,500
-Which you reluctantly took.
-...and found somewhere new.

1498
01:46:48,375 --> 01:46:51,041
Well, Mother has said that there's, um...

1499
01:46:51,125 --> 01:46:52,916
there's... there's always room for you
with us.

1500
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:55,000
Your mother clearly hasn't spent
enough time with me.

1501
01:46:58,375 --> 01:46:59,791
And what if it was I that...

1502
01:47:00,583 --> 01:47:01,583
asked you to stay?

1503
01:47:04,583 --> 01:47:05,541
A kind offer,

1504
01:47:05,916 --> 01:47:07,166
but one I must refuse.

1505
01:47:23,208 --> 01:47:24,041
I...

1506
01:47:24,666 --> 01:47:25,708
How will I... How...

1507
01:47:26,666 --> 01:47:28,083
When will I see you again?

1508
01:47:29,916 --> 01:47:31,166
You're not rid of me <i>yet,</i>

1509
01:47:31,250 --> 01:47:33,875
Viscount Tewkesbury,
Marquess of Basilwether.

1510
01:48:04,208 --> 01:48:05,083
Ah.

1511
01:48:12,291 --> 01:48:13,250
Thank you.

1512
01:48:14,875 --> 01:48:16,125
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

1513
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:22,041
Mother.

1514
01:48:23,708 --> 01:48:25,083
May I borrow your pencil?

1515
01:48:25,541 --> 01:48:26,625
Thank you.

1516
01:48:30,625 --> 01:48:33,541
Numbers turn into letters,

1517
01:48:33,625 --> 01:48:36,166
which forms into...

1518
01:48:36,625 --> 01:48:38,875
<i>Five, two, five, five,</i>
<i>three, three, one.</i>

1519
01:48:39,500 --> 01:48:41,166
<i>One, one, one.</i>

1520
01:48:45,875 --> 01:48:48,958
"Meet me Royal Academy
five tonight Mother."

1521
01:48:50,708 --> 01:48:51,541
Well,

1522
01:48:52,625 --> 01:48:53,916
that's unexpected.

1523
01:48:55,958 --> 01:48:56,875
Thank you.

1524
01:48:56,958 --> 01:48:59,250
There are three thoughts
that immediately occur.

1525
01:48:59,333 --> 01:49:02,333
One is that Mother wouldn't have signed
"Mother," but "Chrysanthemum."

1526
01:49:03,375 --> 01:49:05,583
And two,
the Royal Academy is an institution

1527
01:49:05,666 --> 01:49:08,125
that has consistently neglected
to include women.

1528
01:49:08,666 --> 01:49:11,166
Mother wouldn't have suggested it
as a meeting place.

1529
01:49:11,250 --> 01:49:14,083
And my final thought
is that I may have revealed my hand

1530
01:49:14,166 --> 01:49:16,125
<i>in front of my brother</i>
<i>when checking the newspaper.</i>

1531
01:49:17,291 --> 01:49:19,083
This is Sherlock Holmes's doing.

1532
01:49:22,833 --> 01:49:26,125
And yet, facts don't distract from hope.

1533
01:49:27,333 --> 01:49:29,875
I'll pay you five pounds
to swap clothes with me.

1534
01:49:34,916 --> 01:49:35,916
Anything?

1535
01:49:37,083 --> 01:49:38,333
Nothing at all.

1536
01:49:39,125 --> 01:49:41,208
She beat you once before, little brother,

1537
01:49:41,708 --> 01:49:43,500
and now she may have done so again.

1538
01:49:43,583 --> 01:49:45,666
Oh, I do believe she thought it me,

1539
01:49:46,208 --> 01:49:48,458
but I also believe
that she'd be too intrigued

1540
01:49:48,541 --> 01:49:50,416
not to be here all the same.

1541
01:49:50,500 --> 01:49:52,208
Unfortunately, you were wrong.

1542
01:49:53,666 --> 01:49:55,250
It's possible.

1543
01:49:55,875 --> 01:49:58,250
Nevertheless, if we do find her again,

1544
01:49:58,333 --> 01:49:59,750
I'd like her to be my ward.

1545
01:50:00,416 --> 01:50:01,541
I'll take care of her.

1546
01:50:03,291 --> 01:50:05,458
Well... on your head be it.

1547
01:50:06,458 --> 01:50:07,916
I washed my hands of her.

1548
01:50:08,458 --> 01:50:09,375
Very well.

1549
01:50:10,250 --> 01:50:11,125
All the better.

1550
01:50:13,208 --> 01:50:15,791
You are a strange fish, little brother.

1551
01:50:16,875 --> 01:50:19,083
And you're a cantankerous one,
older brother.

1552
01:50:19,625 --> 01:50:22,375
I assume you're being so delightful
because of the vote?

1553
01:50:22,750 --> 01:50:24,000
Passed by one.

1554
01:50:24,083 --> 01:50:27,166
That reemerging little toadstool,
the Marquess of Tewkesbury,

1555
01:50:27,250 --> 01:50:28,916
and his vote proved decisive.

1556
01:50:29,416 --> 01:50:32,000
Now, much as I enjoy
standing outside the Royal Academy--

1557
01:50:32,083 --> 01:50:34,500
- He's an interesting character, you know?
- Hmm?

1558
01:50:34,583 --> 01:50:36,708
And I suspect he's rather keen
on young Enola.

1559
01:50:36,791 --> 01:50:39,500
Then he should marry her.
Maybe it'll tame them both.

1560
01:50:40,291 --> 01:50:42,291
Drink at the club to commiserate me?

1561
01:50:43,333 --> 01:50:45,875
Yes, I'll buy you a drink, Mycroft.

1562
01:51:09,333 --> 01:51:10,750
Come on, Sherlock!

1563
01:51:21,500 --> 01:51:22,583
Here you go, sir.

1564
01:51:35,833 --> 01:51:37,291
What on earth were you doing?

1565
01:51:38,583 --> 01:51:39,958
Thought I saw something.

1566
01:52:11,125 --> 01:52:13,166
-Good afternoon, Enola.
-Good afternoon.

1567
01:52:13,250 --> 01:52:14,375
You've got a visitor.

1568
01:52:27,208 --> 01:52:29,458
This is a surprisingly nice room.

1569
01:52:30,875 --> 01:52:32,333
I like the finishing touches.

1570
01:52:38,958 --> 01:52:40,958
I can't stay long.

1571
01:52:42,291 --> 01:52:43,625
People might be watching.

1572
01:52:46,708 --> 01:52:48,291
How on earth did you find that?

1573
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:49,875
Sherlock did.

1574
01:52:52,083 --> 01:52:53,791
I thought you had forgotten it.

1575
01:52:55,916 --> 01:52:58,291
You never could leave it alone
as a little girl.

1576
01:52:58,375 --> 01:53:01,083
-You used to drag it around behind you--
-Sherlock said.

1577
01:53:03,583 --> 01:53:06,375
-You'd heard Queen Victoria had--
-Sherlock said that too.

1578
01:53:13,083 --> 01:53:13,916
Well...

1579
01:53:14,875 --> 01:53:16,708
nice that you two have connected.

1580
01:53:24,916 --> 01:53:25,833
I'm sorry.

1581
01:53:30,458 --> 01:53:31,500
I'm sorry.

1582
01:53:34,416 --> 01:53:36,500
I wanted to tell you where I was going,

1583
01:53:37,833 --> 01:53:38,875
but it wasn't safe.

1584
01:53:41,291 --> 01:53:42,416
Are you safe now?

1585
01:53:45,291 --> 01:53:48,625
I didn't leave you
because I didn't love you.

1586
01:53:51,958 --> 01:53:53,500
I left <i>for </i>you...

1587
01:53:54,625 --> 01:53:55,875
because I couldn't bear...

1588
01:53:56,625 --> 01:54:00,875
to have this world be your future.

1589
01:54:03,666 --> 01:54:04,833
So I had to fight.

1590
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:08,833
You have to make some noise

1591
01:54:09,291 --> 01:54:10,500
if you want to be heard.

1592
01:54:14,458 --> 01:54:15,916
Oh, it's funny.

1593
01:54:16,375 --> 01:54:17,250
I thought...

1594
01:54:18,375 --> 01:54:21,666
I was the one
that was going to change the world.

1595
01:54:24,458 --> 01:54:25,541
The reform bill,

1596
01:54:26,875 --> 01:54:29,250
is it true what you did?

1597
01:54:33,958 --> 01:54:35,958
What a woman you've become.

1598
01:55:07,333 --> 01:55:08,875
Thank you for your irises.

1599
01:55:10,708 --> 01:55:11,666
Now, if you ever...

1600
01:55:12,416 --> 01:55:13,458
ever need me,

1601
01:55:14,375 --> 01:55:15,833
I'll be looking out for them.

1602
01:55:19,333 --> 01:55:21,000
-You have to go.
-Yes, but...

1603
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:24,833
let's just stay like this for a bit.

1604
01:55:27,083 --> 01:55:28,333
I'd like that too.

1605
01:55:38,625 --> 01:55:40,500
<i>So, how to conclude?</i>

1606
01:55:43,166 --> 01:55:44,166
My name is Enola,

1607
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:46,875
which, backwards, spells "alone."

1608
01:55:47,708 --> 01:55:49,791
To be a Holmes,
you must find your own path.

1609
01:55:50,666 --> 01:55:51,583
<i>My brothers have,</i>

1610
01:55:53,250 --> 01:55:54,291
<i>my mother has,</i>

1611
01:55:55,291 --> 01:55:56,458
<i>and I must too.</i>

1612
01:55:59,333 --> 01:56:02,500
<i>But I now see that being alone</i>
<i>doesn't mean I have to be lonely.</i>

1613
01:56:03,416 --> 01:56:04,750
<i>Mother never wanted that.</i>

1614
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:08,041
She wanted me to find my freedom,

1615
01:56:08,833 --> 01:56:09,875
<i>my future,</i>

1616
01:56:10,875 --> 01:56:11,958
my purpose.

1617
01:56:13,333 --> 01:56:14,583
I am a detective,

1618
01:56:15,625 --> 01:56:16,916
I am a decipherer,

1619
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:19,583
and I am a finder of lost souls.

1620
01:56:22,666 --> 01:56:23,833
My life is my own.

1621
01:56:26,625 --> 01:56:29,000
And the future is up to us.
