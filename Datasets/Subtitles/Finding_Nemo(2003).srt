No, I see it.<br/>It's beautiful.

11
00:01:04,244 --> 00:01:06,769
So, Coral, when you said<br/>you wanted an ocean view...

12
00:01:06,813 --> 00:01:10,977
you didn't think you'd get<br/>the whole ocean, did you?

[Sighs] Oh, yeah.<br/>A fish can breathe out here.

14
00:01:15,855 --> 00:01:17,789
Did your man deliver,<br/>or did he deliver?

15
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:20,122
- My man delivered.<br/>- And it wasn't so easy.

16
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:23,459
Because a lot of other clownfish<br/>had their eyes on this place.

17
00:01:23,496 --> 00:01:25,930
You better believe they did...<br/>every single one of them.

No, no. I do, I do.<br/>I really do like it.

24
00:01:45,885 --> 00:01:48,820
But, Marlin, I know that<br/>the drop off is desirable...

25
00:01:48,855 --> 00:01:51,119
with the great schools<br/>and the amazing view...

26
00:01:51,157 --> 00:01:52,926

30
00:01:58,298 --> 00:02:00,528
They'll wake up,<br/>poke their little heads out...

We still have to name them.

37
00:02:18,551 --> 00:02:20,314
You want to name<br/>all of them right now?

38
00:02:20,353 --> 00:02:23,618
All right, we'll name<br/>this half Marlin Junior...

39
00:02:23,656 --> 00:02:25,783

Nemo. We'll name one Nemo...

42
00:02:31,231 --> 00:02:33,791

Just think,<br/>in a couple of days...

44

If I ever meet a sea turtle,<br/>I'll ask him.

- Yeah.<br/>- Yeah.

160
00:08:21,147 --> 00:08:24,048
Well, actually,<br/>that's a common misconception.

161
00:08:24,083 --> 00:08:26,608
Clownfish are no funnier<br/>than any other fish.

- Come on, clownie.<br/>- Do something funny.

00:08:28,688 --> 00:08:31,156
All right, I know one joke.

There's a mollusk, see?<br/>And he walks up to a sea...

He doesn't walk up,<br/>he swims up.

Go easy on him.<br/>He's lost his son Fabio.

1036
00:43:15,897 --> 00:43:18,764
Any of you heard of P. Sherman,<br/>42 Wallaby Way, Sydney?

1037
00:43:18,867 --> 00:43:21,495
Sydney? Oh, sure!<br/>[Choir sings]

1038
00:43:21,536 --> 00:43:23,265
Ted here's got relatives<br/>in Sydney.

1039
00:43:23,304 --> 00:43:24,931
- Don't you, Ted?<br/>- Sure do!

1040
00:43:24,973 --> 00:43:26,463
Oh! Hey!<br/>They know Sydney!

[Gasps]

1042
00:43:27,709 --> 00:43:29,199
You wouldn't know how<br/>to get there, would you?

1043
00:43:29,244 --> 00:43:31,212
You want to follow the E.A.C.

1044
00:43:31,246 --> 00:43:33,942
That's the East<br/>Australian Current.

1045
00:43:33,982 --> 00:43:35,609
Big current.<br/>Can't miss it.

1046
00:43:35,650 --> 00:43:38,619
It's in... that direction.

1047
00:43:38,653 --> 00:43:40,553
And then you follow that<br/>for about...

1048
00:43:40,588 --> 00:43:42,351
I don't know.<br/>What do you guys think?

1049
00:43:42,390 --> 00:43:43,550
About three leagues?

1050
00:43:43,591 --> 00:43:46,560
That little baby will put you<br/>right past Sydney.

1051
00:43:46,594 --> 00:43:49,028
- Ta-da!<br/>- That's great!

1052
00:43:49,063 --> 00:43:50,257
Dory, you did it!

1053
00:43:50,298 --> 00:43:52,129
Oh, please,<br/>I'm just your little helper.

1054
00:43:52,167 --> 00:43:54,499
- Helping along. That's me.<br/>- Fellas, thank you.

Hey, wait up, partner!<br/>Hold on!

1062
00:44:15,089 --> 00:44:17,819
Wait, wait, wait!<br/>I gotta tell you something.

1063
00:44:17,859 --> 00:44:20,555

Whoa, partner.<br/>Little red flag going up.

Something's telling me<br/>to swim through it, not over it.

00:44:40,548 --> 00:44:42,175
Are you looking at this thing?

1071
00:44:42,217 --> 00:44:43,707
It's got death<br/>written all over it.

1072
00:44:43,751 --> 00:44:46,584
I really, really, really<br/>think we should swim through.

1073
00:44:46,621 --> 00:44:48,851
And I'm really, really done<br/>talking about this. Over we go.

1074
00:44:48,890 --> 00:44:50,858
- Trust me on this.<br/>- Trust you?

1075
00:44:50,892 --> 00:44:52,757
Yes, trust.<br/>It's what friends do.

00:44:52,794 --> 00:44:54,694
Look! Something shiny!

1077
00:44:54,729 --> 00:44:56,492
- Where?<br/>- It just swam over the trench.

1078
00:44:56,531 --> 00:45:02,237
- Come on, we'll follow it!<br/>- OK!

1079
00:45:02,237 --> 00:45:04,899
Boy, it sure is clear up here.

1080
00:45:04,939 --> 00:45:08,397
Exactly. And look at that...<br/>there's the current.

1081
00:45:08,443 --> 00:45:11,037
We should be there in no time.

1082
00:45:11,079 --> 00:45:12,876
Hey, little guy.

1083
00:45:12,914 --> 00:45:14,677
You wanted to go<br/>through the trench.

1084
00:45:14,716 --> 00:45:16,741
I shall call him Squishy,<br/>and he shall be mine.

1085
00:45:16,784 --> 00:45:18,945
And he shall be my Squishy.<br/>Come here, Squishy.

Shoo, shoo! Get away!

1091

- Let me see that.<br/>- Don't touch it.

1092
00:45:30,632 --> 00:45:32,964
I won't touch it.<br/>I just want to look.

1093
00:45:33,001 --> 00:45:35,026
Hey! How come<br/>it didn't sting you?

1094
00:45:35,069 --> 00:45:36,593
It did.<br/>It's just that...

1095
00:45:36,638 --> 00:45:38,333
- Ow! Ow! Ow!<br/>- Hold still.

1096
00:45:38,373 --> 00:45:39,840
I live in this anemone...

1097
00:45:39,874 --> 00:45:41,739
and I'm used<br/>to these kind of stings.

Ow! Ow! Ow!

But now we know, don't we...

1101
00:45:46,781 --> 00:45:48,976
that we don't want<br/>to touch these again.

1102
00:45:49,017 --> 00:45:52,043
Let's be thankful this time<br/>it was just a little one.

This is gonna be good.<br/>I can tell.

00:56:15,868 --> 00:56:17,836
See, he was mad at me.

1337
00:56:17,870 --> 00:56:19,497
And maybe he wouldn't<br/>have done it...

1338
00:56:19,538 --> 00:56:21,028
if I hadn't been<br/>so tough on him.

1339

I don't know.

1340
00:56:22,341 --> 00:56:24,332
Anyway, he swam out in<br/>the open water to this boat...

1341
00:56:24,376 --> 00:56:27,243
and when he was out there,<br/>these divers appeared...

1342
00:56:27,279 --> 00:56:29,907
and I tried to stop them,<br/>but the boat was too fast.

1343
00:56:29,948 --> 00:56:31,711
So, we swam out in the ocean<br/>to follow them...

1344
00:56:31,750 --> 00:56:34,082
They couldn't stop 'em.<br/>And then Nemo's dad...

1345
00:56:34,119 --> 00:56:36,883
he swims out to the ocean,<br/>and they bump into...

1346

...three ferocious sharks.

1347
00:56:38,257 --> 00:56:40,350
He scares away the sharks<br/>by blowing 'em up!

1348
00:56:40,392 --> 00:56:41,723
Golly, that's amazing.

1349
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:43,387
And then dives<br/>thousands of feet...

1350
00:56:43,429 --> 00:56:45,158
...straight down<br/>into the dark.

1351
00:56:45,197 --> 00:56:46,664
It's wicked dark down there.

1352
00:56:46,698 --> 00:56:48,393
You can't see a thing.<br/>How's it going, Bob?

1353
00:56:48,434 --> 00:56:50,095
And the only thing<br/>they can see down there...

1354
00:56:50,135 --> 00:56:51,864
...is the light from<br/>this big, horrible creature...

1355
00:56:51,904 --> 00:56:53,872
with razor-sharp teeth.<br/>Nice parry, old man.

1356
00:56:53,906 --> 00:56:55,271
And then he has<br/>to blast his way...

1357
00:56:55,307 --> 00:56:56,934
So, these two little fish<br/>have been...

1358
00:56:56,975 --> 00:57:00,512
searching the ocean for days<br/>on the East Australian Current.

1359
00:57:00,512 --> 00:57:02,844
Which means that he may be<br/>on his way here right now.

1360
00:57:02,881 --> 00:57:04,405
That should put him<br/>in Sydney Harbor...

1361
00:57:04,450 --> 00:57:05,747
...in a matter of days.<br/>I mean, it sounds like...

1362
00:57:05,784 --> 00:57:07,775
this guy is gonna<br/>stop at nothing...

1363
00:57:07,820 --> 00:57:10,584
...till he finds his son.<br/>I sure hope he makes it.
