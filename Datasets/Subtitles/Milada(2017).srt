2
00:01:47,126 --> 00:01:49,001
Thank you.

3
00:01:54,793 --> 00:01:58,877
So, how does it feel
being back after how many years?

4
00:01:59,585 --> 00:02:01,502
A long time.

5
00:02:28,045 --> 00:02:30,671
I am Minister of Justice Buresova.

6
00:02:30,921 --> 00:02:33,963
- How do you do, Mrs. Horakova?
- How do you do?

7
00:02:34,046 --> 00:02:35,921
I'm glad to meet you.

8
00:02:37,296 --> 00:02:39,213
Please.

9
00:02:40,838 --> 00:02:42,714
Can I see them first?

10
00:02:45,089 --> 00:02:49,006
We're hoping to hand them to you
in front of the cameras.

11
00:02:49,089 --> 00:02:51,547
A symbolic gesture, if you will.

12
00:02:58,673 --> 00:03:00,548
Thank you.

13
00:03:02,507 --> 00:03:04,882
A bit a late delivery, isn't it?

14
00:03:07,508 --> 00:03:09,424
What should I tell them?

15
00:03:10,841 --> 00:03:14,799
I'm sorry, but I need to read it first.

16
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:27,675
<i>I have recently read somewhere</i>

17
00:03:28,509 --> 00:03:32,676
<i>that a letter is like a ray of light
from a distant star.</i>

18
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,718
<i>Its light comes to us and shines on us,</i>

19
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:43,927
<i>it shows us the way in the darkness
even though the source is often long gone</i>

20
00:03:44,469 --> 00:03:46,761
<i>and it doesn't exist anymore.</i>

21
00:03:48,594 --> 00:03:53,177
<i>I will be embracing you
and kissing you with my words</i>

22
00:03:53,886 --> 00:03:58,512
<i>even though the hand
that has written them will be long gone.</i>

23
00:04:00,512 --> 00:04:02,928
<i>My only little girl Jana,</i>

24
00:04:04,553 --> 00:04:07,471
<i>God blessed my life as a woman with you.</i>

25
00:04:08,429 --> 00:04:13,054
<i>Apart from your father's magic love,</i>

26
00:04:14,513 --> 00:04:18,222
<i>you were the greatest gift
I received from fate.</i>

27
00:04:53,807 --> 00:04:57,558
The President
is expecting you, Mrs. Horakova.

28
00:04:59,225 --> 00:05:04,142
- He's actually seeing me, Bohu.
- Yes and the little part of me.

29
00:05:11,601 --> 00:05:13,768
He was interested in my work.

30
00:05:14,226 --> 00:05:18,394
He was interested in my thoughts
about the women's movement.

31
00:05:18,477 --> 00:05:21,144
So he wants you in politics.

32
00:05:40,395 --> 00:05:42,271
Hitler

33
00:05:43,229 --> 00:05:45,104
deranged, twisted.

34
00:05:48,729 --> 00:05:50,479
Twisted.

35
00:05:50,646 --> 00:05:52,521
Deranged.

36
00:05:54,397 --> 00:05:56,272
Hitler torted

37
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:58,813
Distort twisted.

38
00:05:58,897 --> 00:06:00,688
Hitler's

39
00:06:01,272 --> 00:06:03,147
Distorted?

40
00:06:07,231 --> 00:06:12,189
Our union with Germany
is a perfect example of success.

41
00:06:13,398 --> 00:06:15,273
- Success?
- Yeah.

42
00:06:15,606 --> 00:06:19,399
It is a downright horrible example.

43
00:06:20,274 --> 00:06:22,149
It is not a union.

44
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,315
It is an occupation!

45
00:06:24,982 --> 00:06:26,399
Hysterical woman.

46
00:06:26,482 --> 00:06:30,191
Is every woman with an opinion
hysterical to you?

47
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,275
Czechoslovakia is hardly
an interest to anyone.

48
00:06:34,358 --> 00:06:38,858
Czechoslovakian economy
is one of the largest in the world

49
00:06:38,941 --> 00:06:43,484
and I am sure Herr Hitler is preparing to
occupy us. For that very reason.

50
00:06:43,567 --> 00:06:45,442
Jew!

51
00:06:46,984 --> 00:06:49,901
Protestant as if it matters.

52
00:06:51,192 --> 00:06:53,734
I think it's time for us to go.

53
00:06:55,568 --> 00:06:57,443
Yes.

54
00:07:03,318 --> 00:07:05,943
At which point
would any of you say, "Enough!?"

55
00:07:06,028 --> 00:07:10,778
Must Hitler reach Paris or London
for you to take threat seriously?

56
00:07:18,529 --> 00:07:20,404
Gentlemen

57
00:07:31,863 --> 00:07:34,780
France and Britain
are throwing us to the wolves.

58
00:07:34,863 --> 00:07:37,405
They have only concerned
about their own interests.

59
00:07:37,488 --> 00:07:41,530
And they don't realize
they're simply sheep of a different flock.

60
00:07:43,614 --> 00:07:46,447
The wolf never stops eating.

61
00:07:50,822 --> 00:07:52,697
Is anyone home?

62
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,908
- Boo!
- I had no idea you were there.

63
00:08:18,075 --> 00:08:20,534
I have something for you

64
00:08:21,825 --> 00:08:25,367
from London and Paris.

65
00:08:30,368 --> 00:08:32,243
Help, help.

66
00:08:37,618 --> 00:08:39,618
It was pretty stiff.

67
00:08:43,577 --> 00:08:45,452
Try it on.

68
00:08:49,327 --> 00:08:51,202
It's beautiful.

69
00:08:56,287 --> 00:08:59,662
These trips
are getting longer and longer.

70
00:09:00,328 --> 00:09:02,745
I've always wanted to go to Paris.

71
00:09:02,828 --> 00:09:06,663
- What if a piece of Paris came to you?
- Thank you.

72
00:09:06,746 --> 00:09:08,829
Pepik will take you one day.

73
00:09:09,579 --> 00:09:11,579
Just as your wife took you?

74
00:09:16,454 --> 00:09:18,830
Come on. Help me in the kitchen.

75
00:09:26,372 --> 00:09:28,289
How was the trip?

76
00:09:28,622 --> 00:09:32,331
Well, they were
as agreeable as my own daughter.

77
00:09:33,248 --> 00:09:35,998
It will get better with Jana.

78
00:09:38,373 --> 00:09:42,374
With the others, I am not so sure.

79
00:10:10,376 --> 00:10:12,209
This is a good place.

80
00:10:13,418 --> 00:10:15,001
When?

81
00:10:15,168 --> 00:10:17,043
As soon as we can.

82
00:10:18,085 --> 00:10:19,960
Bohu, I want to do it.

83
00:10:21,835 --> 00:10:25,669
A list of those
willing to help with the resistance.

84
00:10:27,002 --> 00:10:28,502
Of course.

85
00:10:28,585 --> 00:10:30,461
I will carry it.

86
00:10:31,961 --> 00:10:34,295
Are you sure senator Plaminkova?

87
00:10:36,003 --> 00:10:39,003
This was not a good idea.
You have a family.

88
00:10:39,086 --> 00:10:41,086
- No.
- I should do it with myself.

89
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:46,629
No, no, no. Because we are a family,
they are much less likely to search us.

90
00:10:46,712 --> 00:10:48,587
Are you sure about this?

91
00:10:48,712 --> 00:10:50,879
Don't worry, we will be fine.

92
00:10:51,629 --> 00:10:53,504
How do you know?

93
00:11:09,381 --> 00:11:11,298
I should carry the list.

94
00:11:14,464 --> 00:11:16,339
Why?

95
00:11:19,507 --> 00:11:23,882
If anything happens,
they are not likely search a woman.

96
00:11:25,465 --> 00:11:28,090
Everyone's name is on little list,

97
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:31,216
the whole resistance.

98
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,383
I will get rid of it quickly.

99
00:11:53,467 --> 00:11:55,343
Jana.

100
00:12:18,345 --> 00:12:20,262
Family Horak?

101
00:12:36,763 --> 00:12:38,805
Mrs. Horakova?

102
00:12:39,263 --> 00:12:41,138
Yes.

103
00:12:47,889 --> 00:12:52,181
For the love
of God, it's just cough candy!

104
00:12:52,264 --> 00:12:54,557
Too much candy is bad for her teeth.

105
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,515
Enough!

106
00:13:07,558 --> 00:13:11,933
Now when you get home
be sure to share some with Aunt Vera.

107
00:13:12,183 --> 00:13:14,058
You understand?

108
00:13:22,767 --> 00:13:26,059
We are taking you in for questioning.

109
00:13:26,142 --> 00:13:29,225
Where are you taking him?

110
00:13:44,227 --> 00:13:46,102
Come and eat, Jana.

111
00:13:54,895 --> 00:13:56,562
How long?

112
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:00,103
Pappa how am I supposed to know?

113
00:14:00,895 --> 00:14:04,312
- They refused to say.
- I cannot believe this.

114
00:14:04,395 --> 00:14:07,396
I told her it was dangerous and not to go.

115
00:14:10,021 --> 00:14:12,646
Not now, Jana, you'll spoil your ape

116
00:14:19,397 --> 00:14:21,939
- How could she?
- Not now.

117
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:24,897
I will clean the living room.

118
00:14:56,650 --> 00:14:58,525
You were very brave.

119
00:15:02,483 --> 00:15:05,192
They'll be home soon. I'm sure of it.

120
00:15:35,695 --> 00:15:37,570
Get out!

121
00:15:42,071 --> 00:15:44,279
Out. Over here.

122
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:50,196
- Faster.
- Hana Kaufmann!

123
00:15:50,529 --> 00:15:52,612
Come here.

124
00:15:56,363 --> 00:15:58,738
You are the transport from Pankrac prison?

125
00:15:58,822 --> 00:16:00,572
- Yes.
- When were you imprisoned?

126
00:16:00,655 --> 00:16:03,447
- Two years ago.
- What year?

127
00:16:04,072 --> 00:16:05,947
1940.

128
00:16:06,656 --> 00:16:09,364
- Name?
- Milada Horakova.

129
00:16:11,239 --> 00:16:15,489
- It says here you are a doctor.
- Of Jurisprudence.

130
00:16:16,073 --> 00:16:17,948
Good.

131
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,615
You will work in a medical room.

132
00:16:52,701 --> 00:16:55,535
I never thought I would see you again.

133
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:58,993
Milada. What's the latest from outside?

134
00:16:59,785 --> 00:17:01,660
I have no idea.

135
00:17:02,035 --> 00:17:06,203
I was in prison for two years.
I'm lucky to even be here.

136
00:17:07,786 --> 00:17:11,869
I am waiting a new trial.
They sentenced me to death.

137
00:17:12,411 --> 00:17:15,744
- What?
- But I'm waiting a new trial.

138
00:17:22,245 --> 00:17:25,954
I should have never
let you take that list ever.

139
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:32,705
They never found it.

140
00:17:37,496 --> 00:17:39,371
Why did they arrest you?

141
00:17:41,246 --> 00:17:43,122
Because they could.

142
00:17:43,997 --> 00:17:46,372
You will be released tomorrow.

143
00:17:46,581 --> 00:17:48,206
But is she well enough?

144
00:17:48,289 --> 00:17:50,414
She will be fine for transport.

145
00:17:50,497 --> 00:17:52,372
Transport?

146
00:17:53,664 --> 00:17:55,748
You ask too many questions.

147
00:18:16,666 --> 00:18:18,959
- Did you like it?
- Yes, I did.

148
00:18:25,334 --> 00:18:28,875
- Do up the last button.
- Oh, you sound like mom.

149
00:18:29,209 --> 00:18:31,085
Someone needs to.

150
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:37,126
Tell her I have grown a whole bunch
for her for when she comes back.

151
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:39,085
I will.

152
00:18:41,335 --> 00:18:43,252
We have to rush to a train.

153
00:18:45,586 --> 00:18:47,419
Bye.

154
00:19:08,963 --> 00:19:10,838
Sweetheart!

155
00:19:42,257 --> 00:19:44,132
From your husband.

156
00:20:08,926 --> 00:20:10,426
<i>I heard the few days ago</i>

157
00:20:10,509 --> 00:20:14,759
<i>that they transferred you
on the other side of our camp.</i>

158
00:20:14,926 --> 00:20:17,718
<i>I hope you will receive my message</i>

159
00:20:17,801 --> 00:20:21,344
<i>and this ring
that I made out of a bread for you.</i>

160
00:20:22,469 --> 00:20:25,219
<i>I love you. Bohu.</i>

161
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:32,808
Transport!

162
00:21:33,391 --> 00:21:34,891
Faster.

163
00:22:28,104 --> 00:22:30,396
That is factually incorrect.

164
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:34,313
I was in charge of
organising social welfare.

165
00:22:48,856 --> 00:22:52,106
I agree. However, such activity
can be hardly considered a conspiracy.

166
00:22:52,189 --> 00:22:58,148
And may I remind you that the prosecution
failed to provide any evidence.

167
00:23:09,191 --> 00:23:14,191
I commute
your death sentence to eight years

168
00:23:14,274 --> 00:23:16,774
to be served in Aichach.

169
00:23:18,984 --> 00:23:23,525
- Your love will carry me through.
- You are with me always.

170
00:24:01,778 --> 00:24:03,653
Miladka.

171
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:06,946
Jana!

172
00:24:09,196 --> 00:24:11,071
Mamma!

173
00:24:32,531 --> 00:24:34,406
Bohu?

174
00:24:34,865 --> 00:24:36,906
He is here.

175
00:24:55,658 --> 00:24:58,200
The doctor will be here tomorrow.

176
00:25:07,368 --> 00:25:09,243
Bohu

177
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,036
- Mamma?
- What is it?

178
00:25:31,703 --> 00:25:33,578
Is Daddy going to die?

179
00:25:36,495 --> 00:25:39,411
We will to pray for him,
and he will heal.

180
00:25:39,495 --> 00:25:41,661
Why is he sick and you are not?

181
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:50,662
Sometimes it's hard to explain things.

182
00:25:50,746 --> 00:25:52,912
But he is sick because of you.

183
00:25:54,122 --> 00:25:55,997
Why would you say that?

184
00:25:57,663 --> 00:26:00,205
They arrested him because of you.

185
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:02,455
Who told you that?

186
00:26:02,538 --> 00:26:04,413
Auntie.

187
00:26:09,498 --> 00:26:12,206
One day, I will explain everything.

188
00:26:13,248 --> 00:26:15,123
But not tonight.

189
00:26:19,332 --> 00:26:21,207
Here.

190
00:26:25,915 --> 00:26:29,749
Your father made this for me in the camp.

191
00:26:38,375 --> 00:26:40,250
Now try to rest.

192
00:27:06,211 --> 00:27:09,544
She has grown up so much.

193
00:27:13,211 --> 00:27:15,169
Thank you.

194
00:27:15,503 --> 00:27:18,504
You have done a great deal for my family.

195
00:27:19,129 --> 00:27:21,004
Jana is brave.

196
00:27:21,379 --> 00:27:25,754
She could have ended up
in a concentration camp with you.

197
00:27:26,254 --> 00:27:28,879
But she didn't, right?

198
00:27:48,464 --> 00:27:50,339
Jana made the cake.

199
00:28:14,674 --> 00:28:16,549
Taste very good.

200
00:28:45,011 --> 00:28:46,886
She's very confused.

201
00:28:55,178 --> 00:28:58,387
They arrested us because of me?

202
00:29:01,553 --> 00:29:03,720
Why would you say that to her?

203
00:29:04,845 --> 00:29:06,763
I told you it was not safe!

204
00:29:12,763 --> 00:29:18,347
Had everyone stood by, we would be
still living in the Third Reich.

205
00:29:19,222 --> 00:29:21,055
OK.

206
00:29:21,972 --> 00:29:23,764
Let's eat the cake.

207
00:29:36,598 --> 00:29:38,390
It's really good.

208
00:29:51,516 --> 00:29:53,391
What if he dies?

209
00:30:06,601 --> 00:30:08,393
We have to hope.

210
00:30:18,769 --> 00:30:21,727
All these people we knew

211
00:30:23,352 --> 00:30:25,269
are gone.

212
00:30:26,602 --> 00:30:28,477
I don't understand

213
00:30:36,145 --> 00:30:38,020
I don't know.

214
00:30:40,061 --> 00:30:42,896
But I am glad that you came back.

215
00:30:48,854 --> 00:30:53,229
Sometimes we find out later
why things happen as they do.

216
00:31:02,938 --> 00:31:04,813
I am sorry.

217
00:31:06,231 --> 00:31:09,314
I shouldn't have told Jana those things.

218
00:31:10,023 --> 00:31:11,898
I was wrong.

219
00:31:41,066 --> 00:31:43,026
When you are better,

220
00:31:44,067 --> 00:31:46,151
we will move to the country,

221
00:31:47,109 --> 00:31:48,984
build the house.

222
00:31:57,943 --> 00:31:59,818
Sorry.

223
00:32:13,319 --> 00:32:15,778
I'm... I'm thirsty.

224
00:32:33,821 --> 00:32:37,780
Our people do appreciate very highly

225
00:32:37,863 --> 00:32:42,864
the presence of the American Army
on Czechoslovak's soil

226
00:32:43,531 --> 00:32:47,447
and will strengthen
in the future this friendship

227
00:32:47,947 --> 00:32:53,822
which was so happily established
with a great American democracy

228
00:32:54,532 --> 00:32:57,782
through the benefits of our peace.

229
00:33:01,907 --> 00:33:03,782
This is it.

230
00:33:06,949 --> 00:33:09,158
I will miss having you home.

231
00:33:11,241 --> 00:33:13,949
You will enjoy your space with Bohu.

232
00:33:14,908 --> 00:33:19,159
And it's time me and Pepik
started on our own.

233
00:33:53,911 --> 00:33:55,787
So it's true!

234
00:33:57,745 --> 00:33:59,912
- Welcome back.
- You look well.

235
00:33:59,995 --> 00:34:01,870
You lie even better.

236
00:34:02,995 --> 00:34:05,120
Same office, same desk.

237
00:34:05,995 --> 00:34:08,413
Milada, we need you.

238
00:34:09,246 --> 00:34:12,788
My family needs me.
They went through enough.

239
00:34:13,413 --> 00:34:16,621
You know there's no "they"
if the communists gain control.

240
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:18,580
That's a big "if".

241
00:34:18,914 --> 00:34:21,289
The President asked about you.

242
00:34:24,789 --> 00:34:26,664
How is Bohuslav?

243
00:34:28,330 --> 00:34:30,790
- He's doing well.
- It's great.

244
00:34:31,623 --> 00:34:34,165
- How was Jan?
- He is still the foreign minister.

245
00:34:34,248 --> 00:34:36,415
Maybe president one day.

246
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:40,456
He lacks the fortitude
of his father to become one.

247
00:34:40,665 --> 00:34:43,874
I prefer to be direct these days.

248
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:46,207
Why are you here?

249
00:34:47,666 --> 00:34:52,582
We all would be better off if we had
more people like you on our side.

250
00:34:53,457 --> 00:34:57,000
Your flattery won't get you much,
I am afraid.

251
00:34:57,208 --> 00:35:00,000
- Milada.
- Lida.

252
00:35:00,583 --> 00:35:03,125
- It is so good to see you.
- Good to see you.

253
00:35:08,626 --> 00:35:11,751
MILADA HORAKOVA RECEIVES
LEGION OF HONOR IN FRANCE

254
00:35:16,459 --> 00:35:18,085
<i>The Legion of Honor</i>

255
00:35:18,169 --> 00:35:22,294
<i>was awarded to Milada Horakova
by general de Gaulle.</i>

256
00:35:27,585 --> 00:35:29,669
What sorts of concessions?

257
00:35:30,045 --> 00:35:35,211
Military cooperation,
sharing of the Carpathian-Russia region.

258
00:35:35,795 --> 00:35:37,711
Sharing?

259
00:35:37,878 --> 00:35:40,253
The communists are growing stronger.

260
00:35:40,336 --> 00:35:44,587
People are feeling vulnerable,
we need to form a united front.

261
00:35:44,671 --> 00:35:50,587
Then let's unite in calling things exactly
what they are. Coercion and annexation.

262
00:35:51,212 --> 00:35:53,046
Precisely.

263
00:35:53,129 --> 00:35:56,505
That is why we need
your run for Parliament.

264
00:36:02,422 --> 00:36:06,881
Many politicians oppose
what you call equal protection.

265
00:36:07,006 --> 00:36:12,589
They say it is but a simple feminist
ideology, a sort of special privilege.

266
00:36:12,673 --> 00:36:18,132
That is because most politicians
are men governing only for other men.

267
00:36:18,549 --> 00:36:21,674
These need a signature
from the mayor's office.

268
00:36:21,757 --> 00:36:25,299
Are you considering
running for Parliament?

269
00:36:28,049 --> 00:36:29,924
Yes.

270
00:36:30,133 --> 00:36:32,008
Yes.

271
00:36:33,425 --> 00:36:35,383
And why now?

272
00:36:36,883 --> 00:36:38,758
Well

273
00:36:44,426 --> 00:36:46,301
When I was a little girl,

274
00:36:47,801 --> 00:36:52,092
I had a brother and a sister
who died from Scarlet fever.

275
00:36:54,552 --> 00:36:56,427
I had no power to help.

276
00:36:58,802 --> 00:37:04,093
As a member of Parliament
I can help all my brothers and sisters.

277
00:37:08,053 --> 00:37:09,928
Yeah.

278
00:37:11,261 --> 00:37:13,219
- When are you coming back?
- In three days.

279
00:37:13,303 --> 00:37:16,136
- Thank you for your time.
- I'm sorry.

280
00:37:16,261 --> 00:37:19,054
I am a big admirer of your work.

281
00:37:19,887 --> 00:37:24,262
I am divorced and my husband
refuses to help financially.

282
00:37:24,345 --> 00:37:30,221
If only someone were in a more influential
position to promote the laws you advocate.

283
00:37:30,596 --> 00:37:32,513
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

284
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:35,680
Sorry.

285
00:37:35,763 --> 00:37:37,513
- Bye.
- Bye.

286
00:37:37,596 --> 00:37:42,222
Congratulations. I heard Initiative 99
is progressing through the legislature.

287
00:37:42,306 --> 00:37:46,972
Although I'm not sure it's going to be
popular with the Right Wing.

288
00:37:47,056 --> 00:37:52,306
The Right Wing will appreciate
their own pensions when they retire.

289
00:37:52,472 --> 00:37:55,307
- Sorry, I must go.
- You will be fine.

290
00:37:55,598 --> 00:37:57,973
I'm coming, late, but coming.

291
00:37:58,390 --> 00:38:02,932
This law will guarantee
that all survivors of the war,

292
00:38:03,807 --> 00:38:06,224
widows, orphans,

293
00:38:06,974 --> 00:38:09,433
and our wounded heroes,

294
00:38:09,933 --> 00:38:14,391
will never have to suffer
the existential insecurities,

295
00:38:14,849 --> 00:38:17,808
once they rejoin society.

296
00:38:38,685 --> 00:38:42,394
- Impressive first showing as an MP.
- Thank you.

297
00:38:42,727 --> 00:38:44,602
Comrade Horakova.

298
00:38:45,144 --> 00:38:48,561
Ah, Prime Minister Gottwald,
congratulations.

299
00:38:48,644 --> 00:38:50,644
And Mrs. Horakova. Still.

300
00:38:51,561 --> 00:38:53,644
Quite an impassioned plea.

301
00:38:53,977 --> 00:38:58,103
One that I will make certain
my fellow party members hear.

302
00:38:58,187 --> 00:39:02,103
We communists
have a lot of the same values.

303
00:39:02,353 --> 00:39:05,937
Isn't it reassuring, then,
we can share our common goals

304
00:39:06,021 --> 00:39:09,729
while maintaining
our unique party perspectives.

305
00:39:09,813 --> 00:39:12,313
Now if you will excuse me.

306
00:39:25,022 --> 00:39:27,189
Don't worry. It will be fine.

307
00:40:02,192 --> 00:40:05,525
- Hello.
- I will speak to you later then.

308
00:40:06,484 --> 00:40:08,859
Mrs. Horakova? Anezka Spurna.

309
00:40:09,443 --> 00:40:12,359
I just joined
the Council of Czechoslovak Women.

310
00:40:12,443 --> 00:40:14,443
Of course, yes. Pleasure.

311
00:40:14,859 --> 00:40:19,277
I want to continue the work
Senator Plaminkova started.

312
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:22,819
Do you know what happened to her?

313
00:40:23,902 --> 00:40:27,444
Yes. There isn't a day
I don't think about her.

314
00:40:28,527 --> 00:40:31,445
Yes, yes, she was a great woman.

315
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:36,153
Yes, well I look forward to work with you
at the Women's council.

316
00:40:36,236 --> 00:40:40,778
Isn't it just lovely
to return some sense of normalcy

317
00:40:41,028 --> 00:40:43,571
after the horrors we've all seen.

318
00:40:44,612 --> 00:40:47,904
Some of us, of course, more than others.

319
00:40:49,987 --> 00:40:54,530
How fortunate we all are
that the Soviets liberated us.

320
00:40:54,697 --> 00:40:59,613
Actually, our camp was freed
by American soldiers, not Soviet.

321
00:41:00,822 --> 00:41:05,488
Well, it's a shame, the Americans
weren't able to come as far as Prague.

322
00:41:05,572 --> 00:41:09,489
They had an agreement
to liberate Prague together

323
00:41:09,698 --> 00:41:12,323
but Stalin barged in days earlier.

324
00:41:13,156 --> 00:41:18,199
Then we should applaud
our true liberators' eagerness.

325
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:24,865
- It was lovely to meet you finally.
- You as far.

326
00:41:34,283 --> 00:41:38,200
She had the nerve to try
to recruit me, right there.

327
00:41:38,658 --> 00:41:40,533
Such propaganda.

328
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:44,992
She is only one person.

329
00:41:45,076 --> 00:41:50,992
But it is not, there are many and they
are going especially for the young ones.

330
00:41:52,367 --> 00:41:54,285
Alois was right.

331
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:58,077
Those who want democracy
need all the help they can get.

332
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,618
Why does it always have to be you?

333
00:42:17,369 --> 00:42:22,495
You have always supported me,
I cannot do this without you.

334
00:42:25,412 --> 00:42:28,704
You know I will support you
as long as I can.

335
00:42:44,581 --> 00:42:46,831
I'll not put us in danger.

336
00:42:47,914 --> 00:42:49,789
I promise.

337
00:43:45,836 --> 00:43:49,502
How did we go from
wanting them out of our country

338
00:43:50,336 --> 00:43:52,502
to seeking asylum in theirs?

339
00:43:56,003 --> 00:43:57,878
Are people blind?

340
00:43:59,128 --> 00:44:03,253
People are told what they want to hear.
And so they will believe it.

341
00:44:03,378 --> 00:44:07,754
And they will continue to believe it
until it is too late.

342
00:44:40,298 --> 00:44:43,007
So that's Gottwald keeping us safe.

343
00:44:44,549 --> 00:44:48,007
- From what?
- From our freedom, apparently.

344
00:44:52,299 --> 00:44:54,175
I can and I will speak up.

345
00:44:54,383 --> 00:44:56,925
I am still a Member of Parliament.

346
00:45:01,175 --> 00:45:03,133
If it doesn't work?

347
00:45:04,425 --> 00:45:07,343
Then we will find
other ways to voice our dissent.

348
00:45:17,009 --> 00:45:20,469
I am returning
from the presidential castle

349
00:45:20,844 --> 00:45:27,469
where the President has accepted the
resignation of the democratic ministers.

350
00:45:27,677 --> 00:45:33,428
Today, we Communists celebrate this,
the Victorious February!

351
00:45:48,596 --> 00:45:50,471
What is it?

352
00:45:59,930 --> 00:46:01,805
Anezka

353
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:05,555
Why are you here?

354
00:46:07,098 --> 00:46:13,473
Surely it would be easier for us all
to unite with one voice.

355
00:46:14,889 --> 00:46:16,806
It's not too late for you.

356
00:46:16,889 --> 00:46:22,807
This attempt of Communist scheme
to unite, as you say, with one voice,

357
00:46:23,474 --> 00:46:26,765
seems to have created a deafening silence.

358
00:46:28,932 --> 00:46:32,016
What you call a deafening silence,

359
00:46:33,058 --> 00:46:36,266
I believe is actually the sound of peace.

360
00:46:37,766 --> 00:46:41,850
But people like you insist on disrupting

361
00:46:41,975 --> 00:46:45,517
that tranquility with your falsehoods,

362
00:46:46,642 --> 00:46:50,184
and I cannot
for the life of me understand why.

363
00:46:51,392 --> 00:46:55,727
If you do not
and will not support Communism,

364
00:46:56,477 --> 00:46:59,018
then you are a threat to this country.

365
00:46:59,102 --> 00:47:01,810
And this is what you call democracy.

366
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:06,519
The choice remains yours, of course.

367
00:47:06,811 --> 00:47:10,186
But if I don't oblige

368
00:47:11,061 --> 00:47:13,603
then there will be consequences.

369
00:47:14,269 --> 00:47:16,144
Am I right?

370
00:47:20,020 --> 00:47:22,687
You have a wonderful family.

371
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:26,729
You should think of them.

372
00:47:29,020 --> 00:47:31,438
It is time for you to go.

373
00:47:50,397 --> 00:47:53,022
It is no longer safe, I know.

374
00:47:55,357 --> 00:47:57,232
See you in the morning.

375
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:59,315
I'll be ready.

376
00:48:53,152 --> 00:48:55,028
What?

377
00:48:56,695 --> 00:48:58,570
What is wrong?

378
00:49:04,070 --> 00:49:08,488
The Communist...
it is the Nazis all over again.

379
00:49:12,446 --> 00:49:14,321
What do we do?

380
00:49:20,489 --> 00:49:22,364
How about just leaving?

381
00:49:35,615 --> 00:49:37,781
I am considering resigning.

382
00:49:39,323 --> 00:49:41,198
Good.

383
00:49:41,865 --> 00:49:43,741
Resign, and then we go.

384
00:49:46,116 --> 00:49:49,032
We are giving up our mandates to fight.

385
00:49:50,157 --> 00:49:53,782
What sort of fight
it would be if I run away?

386
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:56,575
Fight for Jana.

387
00:49:56,992 --> 00:49:58,867
For once, put her first.

388
00:50:02,158 --> 00:50:04,033
I am.

389
00:50:05,867 --> 00:50:07,743
But I want to believe

390
00:50:09,368 --> 00:50:11,451
that evil will be punished.

391
00:50:13,409 --> 00:50:18,785
I want to force myself to believe
that the world will be as it should be.

392
00:50:21,202 --> 00:50:24,994
But if we are not free,

393
00:50:26,077 --> 00:50:27,952
then Jana is not free

394
00:50:29,702 --> 00:50:32,411
and I cannot bear the thought of it.

395
00:50:44,454 --> 00:50:47,454
He was to leave for London this morning.

396
00:50:52,079 --> 00:50:54,163
I spoke to him right before.

397
00:50:57,830 --> 00:50:59,705
Be careful.

398
00:51:57,835 --> 00:51:59,668
Who did it?

399
00:52:03,127 --> 00:52:05,543
Russians most likely.

400
00:52:06,503 --> 00:52:09,378
Do we have proof? Some evidence?

401
00:52:11,419 --> 00:52:15,961
Everything was cleaned up
by the time the police showed up.

402
00:52:24,254 --> 00:52:26,962
They say he jumped from that window?

403
00:52:28,045 --> 00:52:31,005
No. From that window.

404
00:52:36,171 --> 00:52:38,046
And yet he landed here.

405
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:40,755
Yes.

406
00:52:43,756 --> 00:52:46,131
There's a reason for me to stay.

407
00:52:46,839 --> 00:52:49,922
There are still people in need
from social services.

408
00:52:50,006 --> 00:52:52,547
I can help them get funds, documents.

409
00:52:52,672 --> 00:52:54,715
It's a lost battle, Milada.

410
00:52:58,715 --> 00:53:01,007
You should know when to leave.

411
00:53:04,340 --> 00:53:06,216
No.

412
00:53:07,174 --> 00:53:12,549
Tell whomever needs to escape the country
to come to my office and say they are

413
00:53:12,633 --> 00:53:14,508
they are case 45.

414
00:53:15,174 --> 00:53:20,425
If they don't hesitate to kill
the foreign minister of sovereign nation,

415
00:53:22,217 --> 00:53:24,092
they will go further.

416
00:53:38,426 --> 00:53:40,301
Case 45.

417
00:53:47,427 --> 00:53:49,302
Our democracy

418
00:53:50,302 --> 00:53:54,553
was a sacred institution to be cherished,

419
00:53:55,553 --> 00:53:57,428
protected.

420
00:53:57,762 --> 00:54:00,595
I fear we no longer have those values.

421
00:54:01,845 --> 00:54:05,803
And thus with the heaviest of heart

422
00:54:07,471 --> 00:54:09,346
I hereby resign

423
00:54:10,679 --> 00:54:12,554
in protest.

424
00:54:27,097 --> 00:54:29,722
So, when are you going to arrest me?

425
00:54:30,098 --> 00:54:31,973
Now?

426
00:54:36,306 --> 00:54:38,181
So what do you suggest?

427
00:54:39,223 --> 00:54:43,849
She is still popular with the public.
We need her on our side.

428
00:54:44,516 --> 00:54:46,432
I have tried everything.

429
00:54:47,349 --> 00:54:49,224
Try harder.

430
00:55:16,934 --> 00:55:19,477
I think it is time to leave Prague.

431
00:55:26,102 --> 00:55:27,977
Come in.

432
00:55:31,353 --> 00:55:34,145
I am case number 45.

433
00:55:34,228 --> 00:55:36,103
Right.

434
00:55:37,978 --> 00:55:39,853
Lida

435
00:55:40,186 --> 00:55:42,354
This needs to go downstairs.

436
00:55:46,896 --> 00:55:48,771
Please, come in.

437
00:55:52,687 --> 00:55:54,563
When are you crossing?

438
00:55:54,813 --> 00:55:56,688
Hopefully by Friday.

439
00:55:57,855 --> 00:55:59,730
Thank you.

440
00:56:00,688 --> 00:56:02,605
Thank you for everything.

441
00:56:02,688 --> 00:56:04,563
Good luck.

442
00:56:54,860 --> 00:56:57,652
Hello. Welcome.

443
00:56:58,152 --> 00:57:00,027
Hello.

444
00:57:00,818 --> 00:57:02,693
Hello.

445
00:57:03,402 --> 00:57:05,277
Hello.

446
00:57:59,198 --> 00:58:01,073
I have been fired.

447
00:58:01,907 --> 00:58:03,823
They took over the radio.

448
00:58:17,658 --> 00:58:22,825
When you get to the safe house,
you must ask where is the blacksmith.

449
00:58:24,409 --> 00:58:27,117
This will be enough for your family.

450
00:58:34,910 --> 00:58:39,118
If they catch you,
please destroy the list, OK?

451
00:58:43,202 --> 00:58:45,077
Be safe.

452
00:58:48,661 --> 00:58:50,536
Thank you.

453
00:59:03,162 --> 00:59:05,037
We should cross today.

454
00:59:08,704 --> 00:59:10,579
We have time.

455
00:59:11,788 --> 00:59:14,454
No, no we can't trust anyone.

456
00:59:16,079 --> 00:59:18,539
We can trust our informant.

457
00:59:43,957 --> 00:59:46,332
- I will be fine.
- Are you sure?

458
00:59:50,041 --> 00:59:51,916
I will catch a tram.

459
00:59:54,542 --> 00:59:56,417
Goodbye.

460
01:01:02,422 --> 01:01:04,297
I was never a good wife

461
01:01:06,589 --> 01:01:08,464
...more of a lover.

462
01:01:10,006 --> 01:01:11,881
But...

463
01:01:12,756 --> 01:01:14,631
...never a good wife.

464
01:01:16,923 --> 01:01:20,549
I often sin against
the goodness of your heart.

465
01:01:22,257 --> 01:01:24,132
I neglect you.

466
01:01:25,715 --> 01:01:28,715
I always rely on your being there.

467
01:01:42,884 --> 01:01:45,134
Will you ever forgive me?

468
01:02:08,094 --> 01:02:10,094
I think it is time to leave.

469
01:02:17,761 --> 01:02:19,845
Thank you, Lida, thank you.

470
01:02:23,012 --> 01:02:25,095
- Alois.
- Milada.

471
01:02:25,262 --> 01:02:27,970
We have been friends for many years.

472
01:02:28,512 --> 01:02:31,513
- I hope you trust me.
- Of course.

473
01:02:33,846 --> 01:02:36,763
Have you been speaking to Communists?

474
01:02:37,638 --> 01:02:39,805
You know, I talk to everyone.

475
01:02:40,680 --> 01:02:43,681
Have you accepted the position within?

476
01:02:45,472 --> 01:02:50,347
Milada, I will go
where I can best serve the people.

477
01:02:50,889 --> 01:02:52,764
So you have.

478
01:02:54,390 --> 01:02:56,265
I did not.

479
01:02:58,057 --> 01:02:59,932
Not yet.

480
01:03:03,140 --> 01:03:05,015
What do they have on you?

481
01:03:07,808 --> 01:03:10,766
- My family.
- I have a family too.

482
01:03:11,641 --> 01:03:14,099
But your parents are not German.

483
01:03:25,184 --> 01:03:27,059
Thank you.

484
01:03:57,687 --> 01:04:00,437
Gottwald is the head of government

485
01:04:00,520 --> 01:04:06,646
approximately 300 are in urgent need to
escape or at high risk of prosecution.

486
01:04:06,979 --> 01:04:10,688
The Communists
have overtaken the government.

487
01:04:11,021 --> 01:04:16,313
Annette, this is the latest
intelligence from Czechoslovakia.

488
01:04:43,482 --> 01:04:48,691
I'll quickly finish up everything at work,
and will meet you and Jana at two.

489
01:05:07,651 --> 01:05:09,526
Yes, I will do it.

490
01:05:15,526 --> 01:05:17,818
- Maruska.
- Good afternoon.

491
01:05:21,652 --> 01:05:23,527
Thank you.

492
01:05:28,610 --> 01:05:30,070
What?

493
01:05:30,153 --> 01:05:32,361
What is the problem?

494
01:05:35,695 --> 01:05:37,570
Keys.

495
01:05:41,236 --> 01:05:43,112
Sit down.

496
01:06:13,823 --> 01:06:15,698
- Who are you?
- Police.

497
01:06:17,364 --> 01:06:19,032
Come on.

498
01:06:26,324 --> 01:06:28,199
Sit down.

499
01:06:28,782 --> 01:06:30,658
Sit down!

500
01:06:47,701 --> 01:06:51,617
I have worked for Mrs. Horakova
for over ten years.

501
01:07:14,036 --> 01:07:17,494
- What people? Their names?
- I am just a help.

502
01:07:17,953 --> 01:07:19,829
I was never introduced.

503
01:07:24,829 --> 01:07:26,704
I must get your mom.

504
01:07:29,454 --> 01:07:31,330
I will come back for you.

505
01:07:32,746 --> 01:07:34,580
Sugar?

506
01:07:39,580 --> 01:07:41,663
They don't drink tea.

507
01:07:41,746 --> 01:07:45,164
Mrs. Horakova's guests
never asked for tea.

508
01:07:45,331 --> 01:07:46,539
That's all

509
01:08:48,044 --> 01:08:49,919
- Hello?
- It's me.

510
01:08:50,086 --> 01:08:51,502
Veruska.

511
01:09:15,963 --> 01:09:18,797
I thought the three of you
might want to come for dinner tonight.

512
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:21,255
No talk of politics. Just family.

513
01:09:26,380 --> 01:09:28,255
Oh Vera I have to go.

514
01:09:29,630 --> 01:09:31,506
I have visitors.

515
01:10:30,345 --> 01:10:33,636
On what legal grounds
am I being arrested?

516
01:11:44,517 --> 01:11:47,059
State your name and date of birth.

517
01:11:47,892 --> 01:11:51,101
Milada Horakova, born Kralova.

518
01:11:51,892 --> 01:11:54,268
December 25, 1901.

519
01:11:55,893 --> 01:11:59,477
When did you first engage
in political activities?

520
01:11:59,560 --> 01:12:02,602
I have the right to know
why I am being held.

521
01:12:02,685 --> 01:12:04,685
You don't have any rights.

522
01:12:04,768 --> 01:12:09,353
Presumption of innocence,
and according to Law 1523 Paragraph 4B,

523
01:12:09,436 --> 01:12:13,436
I have the right to know
what I am being arrested for.

524
01:12:14,978 --> 01:12:17,686
Where is my husband and my daughter?

525
01:12:19,604 --> 01:12:23,687
First, tell me.
Then we can discuss your family.

526
01:12:25,645 --> 01:12:27,520
Do you have children?

527
01:12:27,937 --> 01:12:29,812
No, no, no.

528
01:12:31,563 --> 01:12:33,938
I am the one asking the questions!

529
01:13:11,274 --> 01:13:13,149
Hello, Mrs. Horakova.

530
01:13:15,691 --> 01:13:17,566
Do you remember me?

531
01:13:20,317 --> 01:13:22,400
I did an interview with you.

532
01:13:24,442 --> 01:13:26,859
It was a long time ago.

533
01:13:31,985 --> 01:13:33,860
This is your bed.

534
01:13:50,819 --> 01:13:52,694
If you ended up here,

535
01:13:54,903 --> 01:13:56,862
no one is safe.

536
01:14:10,029 --> 01:14:12,571
You need to find something on her.

537
01:14:12,988 --> 01:14:15,779
I spent the last four months
interrogating her.

538
01:14:15,863 --> 01:14:18,322
If there was anything,
we would have found it.

539
01:14:18,405 --> 01:14:21,072
- Be creative.
- How?

540
01:15:06,618 --> 01:15:10,076
Let's give her one hour of
interrupted sleep and then continue.

541
01:15:10,159 --> 01:15:13,118
But she's been up for two days now.
Still not working.

542
01:15:13,201 --> 01:15:15,076
So what?

543
01:15:20,494 --> 01:15:22,369
Go in.

544
01:15:36,286 --> 01:15:38,161
The case has no substance.

545
01:15:38,245 --> 01:15:42,412
I have no evidence to build on,
no clues, no witnesses.

546
01:15:46,496 --> 01:15:50,954
I don't understand
which one of them is the one to go after.

547
01:16:04,455 --> 01:16:06,331
Her?

548
01:16:07,206 --> 01:16:09,081
And?

549
01:16:09,706 --> 01:16:11,581
She needs to learn this.

550
01:16:14,914 --> 01:16:16,789
You can leave now.

551
01:16:26,999 --> 01:16:29,540
I don't know how to approach this.

552
01:16:34,333 --> 01:16:36,500
We trust you'll find the way.

553
01:16:47,417 --> 01:16:50,917
Beautiful wife and very young daughter.

554
01:17:29,879 --> 01:17:31,755
Bring another one!

555
01:17:37,380 --> 01:17:39,796
Milada, I am sorry. They forced me.

556
01:17:39,880 --> 01:17:41,755
Quiet!

557
01:17:50,756 --> 01:17:52,631
Leave us.

558
01:18:32,760 --> 01:18:35,843
- But we're family.
- I cannot help you.

559
01:18:36,468 --> 01:18:39,385
Even the Nazis allowed us to visit her.

560
01:19:03,095 --> 01:19:04,970
I don't understand.

561
01:19:05,553 --> 01:19:07,554
We broke them all but her.

562
01:19:14,429 --> 01:19:17,721
- We will do this differently.
- How?

563
01:19:19,889 --> 01:19:21,764
Her family.

564
01:19:28,639 --> 01:19:30,515
Let me do this.

565
01:19:31,515 --> 01:19:33,390
I am a woman.

566
01:19:35,348 --> 01:19:37,098
Fine.

567
01:19:37,765 --> 01:19:39,515
Thanks.

568
01:19:52,807 --> 01:19:54,683
Stay still.

569
01:20:02,267 --> 01:20:04,142
Water?

570
01:20:41,936 --> 01:20:43,812
Vera.

571
01:20:52,854 --> 01:20:54,730
Have you seen Milada?

572
01:20:55,063 --> 01:20:56,938
How is she?

573
01:20:57,647 --> 01:21:01,563
It's no longer safe for you here.
You have to leave.

574
01:21:02,022 --> 01:21:03,897
Not without Jana.

575
01:21:07,023 --> 01:21:08,898
They are watching her.

576
01:21:10,523 --> 01:21:12,356
No, no.

577
01:21:14,814 --> 01:21:19,190
Once you are in Germany,
you will get her through the Red Cross.

578
01:22:16,319 --> 01:22:18,195
You had a bad dream.

579
01:22:19,362 --> 01:22:21,237
It all will be fine.

580
01:22:23,279 --> 01:22:25,154
I was with my daughter

581
01:22:30,780 --> 01:22:33,071
in the most beautiful place.

582
01:23:17,949 --> 01:23:19,825
Tell Jana I will get her.

583
01:23:21,367 --> 01:23:23,950
- Promise her.
- I will.

584
01:23:25,367 --> 01:23:27,242
You need to go.

585
01:23:40,035 --> 01:23:41,910
That's irrelevant!

586
01:23:42,411 --> 01:23:48,202
You cooperated with Western Imperialists
to destabilize the elected government!

587
01:23:48,286 --> 01:23:53,119
An opposition does not destabilize
a legitimate government.

588
01:23:53,744 --> 01:23:55,412
Here.

589
01:23:55,495 --> 01:23:59,495
I have aided and cooperated
with Western Imperialist

590
01:23:59,578 --> 01:24:04,287
in destabilizing democratically
elected communist government!

591
01:24:04,370 --> 01:24:06,246
Your last chance.

592
01:24:06,454 --> 01:24:08,329
Sign it.

593
01:24:16,204 --> 01:24:18,372
We will do this differently.

594
01:25:06,334 --> 01:25:08,209
Interrogation!

595
01:25:47,587 --> 01:25:50,212
Still claiming innocence, right?

596
01:25:56,380 --> 01:25:58,297
Think about your family.

597
01:26:00,005 --> 01:26:04,380
You can see them so soon
if you just confess.

598
01:26:41,091 --> 01:26:43,467
Haven't they suffered enough?

599
01:26:48,134 --> 01:26:50,009
If I were you,

600
01:26:52,009 --> 01:26:53,884
I would sign.

601
01:26:56,927 --> 01:26:59,218
It's good to have principles,

602
01:27:00,927 --> 01:27:04,260
but you still have a daughter,

603
01:27:05,218 --> 01:27:07,094
husband.

604
01:27:19,012 --> 01:27:21,345
One last time.

605
01:27:25,429 --> 01:27:27,304
Sign it.

606
01:27:31,263 --> 01:27:33,138
Sign it.

607
01:28:13,308 --> 01:28:15,933
Your daughter is with your sister.

608
01:28:17,183 --> 01:28:19,059
And my husband?

609
01:28:38,768 --> 01:28:44,936
I have aided and cooperated
with Western Imperialist powers

610
01:28:47,811 --> 01:28:55,270
in destabilizing the democratically
elected communist government.

611
01:30:01,275 --> 01:30:05,400
I confess to leading
a traitors' resistance movement

612
01:30:06,026 --> 01:30:09,609
against the democratically
elected Communist government,

613
01:30:09,693 --> 01:30:12,734
with the intention of aiding
Western Imperialists

614
01:30:12,818 --> 01:30:15,734
to undermine our national integrity.

615
01:30:16,859 --> 01:30:18,735
It is correct.

616
01:30:25,360 --> 01:30:29,985
You see, you realized
how wrong you were in the end.

617
01:30:31,570 --> 01:30:36,528
Now just make sure
it sounds like you believe it.

618
01:30:42,029 --> 01:30:46,196
Confess to leading
a traitors' resistance movement

619
01:30:46,279 --> 01:30:51,446
against the democratically
elected Communist government.

620
01:30:57,405 --> 01:31:01,947
Make sure they are well cleaned up
and fed before the trial.

621
01:31:08,656 --> 01:31:11,489
Against the Communist government.

622
01:31:55,368 --> 01:31:57,243
It's so tragic.

623
01:31:57,660 --> 01:32:01,452
We're working to build this country,
and they want to destroy it.

624
01:32:01,535 --> 01:32:03,368
I hope they all hang.

625
01:32:40,746 --> 01:32:42,539
Traitor!

626
01:33:26,250 --> 01:33:28,125
State your name.

627
01:33:28,917 --> 01:33:31,418
- Frana Zeminova.
- Zavis Kalandra.

628
01:33:31,501 --> 01:33:34,293
- Josef Nestaval.
- Milada Horakova.

629
01:33:34,418 --> 01:33:37,043
Are you aware of the charges against you?

630
01:33:37,126 --> 01:33:39,001
I am.

631
01:33:40,251 --> 01:33:42,544
- I am.
- Yes, I am.

632
01:33:42,627 --> 01:33:44,794
- Yes.
- Do you plead guilty to these crimes?

633
01:33:44,877 --> 01:33:49,627
Confess to leading
a traitors' resistance movement

634
01:33:50,044 --> 01:33:51,252
I am.

635
01:33:51,336 --> 01:33:56,628
Against the democratically
elected Communist government

636
01:33:57,253 --> 01:34:00,087
I am guilty of all I have confessed to.

637
01:34:00,628 --> 01:34:05,253
However, I do not believe
they constituted any wrong doing.

638
01:34:11,463 --> 01:34:14,296
Mrs. Horakova, as a defendant

639
01:34:14,379 --> 01:34:19,505
you are trying to excuse
acts of treason and conspiracy.

640
01:34:21,214 --> 01:34:23,547
Only according to one's conscience.

641
01:34:23,630 --> 01:34:28,005
You conspired against
everyday people of this country,

642
01:34:28,505 --> 01:34:32,090
factory workers, children, mothers.

643
01:34:57,967 --> 01:34:59,842
It is a farce trial.

644
01:35:01,717 --> 01:35:03,508
Are you sure?

645
01:35:05,967 --> 01:35:07,843
Nothing but theater.

646
01:35:15,218 --> 01:35:17,926
She thinks it's a farce trial.

647
01:35:19,677 --> 01:35:22,844
Nothing but theater, she said.

648
01:35:24,427 --> 01:35:27,385
When asleep, she started calling Jana.

649
01:35:29,760 --> 01:35:34,845
She woke up at approximately 10PM.

650
01:35:36,303 --> 01:35:38,136
That's enough.

651
01:35:38,261 --> 01:35:40,136
Take her out.

652
01:35:47,971 --> 01:35:50,804
I remain faithful to my convictions.

653
01:35:51,554 --> 01:35:53,429
Freedom.

654
01:35:53,554 --> 01:35:55,430
Equality.

655
01:35:55,763 --> 01:35:57,638
Democracy.

656
01:35:57,805 --> 01:35:59,680
Compassion.

657
01:36:00,263 --> 01:36:04,638
No one in this country
should be imprisoned or made to die

658
01:36:05,388 --> 01:36:07,264
for their beliefs.

659
01:36:07,598 --> 01:36:12,139
Comrade, I did not ask you
for a dictionary.

660
01:36:13,056 --> 01:36:16,306
The ordinary worker
wants hear honest answers,

661
01:36:16,431 --> 01:36:18,890
not evasive, bourgeois jargon.

662
01:36:19,265 --> 01:36:24,140
rs. Horakova, tell us clearly if you are
guilty of conspiring in an illegal way

663
01:36:24,224 --> 01:36:28,557
against our people
and the democratic Czechoslovakia?

664
01:36:28,682 --> 01:36:30,558
Yes, I am guilty of that.

665
01:36:31,225 --> 01:36:33,975
Now, that is a clear statement.

666
01:36:36,683 --> 01:36:42,226
Mrs. Horakova, you claim that you are
guilty of treason and conspiracy,

667
01:36:42,434 --> 01:36:44,809
but only under the current law,

668
01:36:45,434 --> 01:36:49,517
were treason and conspiracy
legal under the old law?

669
01:36:51,184 --> 01:36:53,559
Not in the way you interpret it.

670
01:36:54,268 --> 01:36:58,810
Thank you, I need no
further response from this defendant.

671
01:37:42,231 --> 01:37:45,314
And we found those enemies of the people.

672
01:37:45,564 --> 01:37:50,106
We were able to find them,
and we brought them here to trial.

673
01:37:51,314 --> 01:37:56,565
The accused Milada Horakova
was organizing adverse groups

674
01:37:56,690 --> 01:37:58,857
to destroy our country!

675
01:37:59,565 --> 01:38:03,940
<i>These terrorists
were planning the Third World War</i>

676
01:38:04,023 --> 01:38:08,108
<i>with the Western Imperialist
to destroy us all.</i>

677
01:38:08,524 --> 01:38:11,233
<i>But we are smarter than them.</i>

678
01:38:11,316 --> 01:38:14,524
<i>We found them
and brought them to justice.</i>

679
01:38:15,233 --> 01:38:20,942
<i>Your honor, I ask for the harshest
punishment for all of them.</i>

680
01:38:24,025 --> 01:38:28,942
<i>The execution
is scheduled for the 27th of June.</i>

681
01:38:46,694 --> 01:38:49,277
If you ask the court for clemency,

682
01:38:49,944 --> 01:38:52,944
they may commute your sentence to life.

683
01:39:00,320 --> 01:39:02,820
I have done nothing wrong.

684
01:39:17,154 --> 01:39:20,114
- What is this?
- Clemency requests.

685
01:39:21,239 --> 01:39:22,155
I plead with you

686
01:39:22,239 --> 01:39:25,655
not to carry out the death sentences
on Milada Horakova and company, STOP,

687
01:39:26,447 --> 01:39:30,073
they were victims of Nazism and suffered
in the concentration camps, STOP,

688
01:39:30,156 --> 01:39:32,573
I am deeply convinced
they deserve to live.

689
01:39:33,198 --> 01:39:36,031
Signed Professor Albert Einstein.

690
01:39:36,656 --> 01:39:38,531
Eleanor Roosevelt.

691
01:39:39,448 --> 01:39:41,323
Winston Churchill.

692
01:39:42,324 --> 01:39:44,199
Jean-Paul Sartre.

693
01:39:44,407 --> 01:39:46,241
Who?

694
01:39:47,324 --> 01:39:49,616
From her father and daughter.

695
01:40:42,621 --> 01:40:44,496
Hello?

696
01:40:45,496 --> 01:40:47,371
Yes.

697
01:40:53,412 --> 01:40:55,288
I see.

698
01:40:57,580 --> 01:40:59,497
Thank you.

699
01:41:04,788 --> 01:41:06,664
Clemency was denied.

700
01:44:24,347 --> 01:44:26,639
Don't tell her about the baby.

701
01:44:43,516 --> 01:44:45,391
It is good to see you.

702
01:44:46,557 --> 01:44:49,557
No physical contact with the prisoner.

703
01:44:54,183 --> 01:44:56,058
How is father?

704
01:44:56,600 --> 01:44:58,475
Holding up.

705
01:45:03,225 --> 01:45:07,059
I agree it is better
that you asked him not to come.

706
01:45:12,226 --> 01:45:14,518
I am not sure how he would

707
01:45:20,269 --> 01:45:23,269
I wish I knew what happened to Bohuslav.

708
01:45:25,269 --> 01:45:27,144
They will not tell me.

709
01:45:31,020 --> 01:45:35,561
Mamma, you haven't done anything,
why are they doing this?

710
01:45:37,770 --> 01:45:41,270
Auntie will explain it to you in time.

711
01:45:46,062 --> 01:45:48,562
Aunt Vera is pregnant.

712
01:45:59,897 --> 01:46:01,813
That is wonderful, Vera.

713
01:46:08,564 --> 01:46:11,189
You will make a great mother, Vera.

714
01:46:14,398 --> 01:46:17,314
I still remember the day you were born.

715
01:46:18,857 --> 01:46:23,149
Mother was so sick
that father had to run and get a doctor

716
01:46:23,232 --> 01:46:25,774
and then he placed you in my arms,

717
01:46:27,357 --> 01:46:29,232
when I held you

718
01:46:29,815 --> 01:46:31,900
you were my first daughter.

719
01:46:35,025 --> 01:46:36,941
So much have changed.

720
01:46:38,858 --> 01:46:41,941
And just now I am so sorry

721
01:46:43,109 --> 01:46:45,567
I will never be able to repay you.

722
01:46:46,526 --> 01:46:48,901
She will be able to stay with us.

723
01:46:49,776 --> 01:46:51,651
We are all a family.

724
01:46:52,317 --> 01:46:54,402
I will take a good care of them.

725
01:46:54,568 --> 01:46:56,443
Thank you.

726
01:46:57,610 --> 01:46:59,485
Mamma.

727
01:47:03,568 --> 01:47:05,443
When you think of me,

728
01:47:06,694 --> 01:47:10,528
know that I am always always with you.

729
01:47:16,486 --> 01:47:19,320
Can I hold my daughter, one last time?

730
01:47:19,904 --> 01:47:22,362
No physical contact is allowed.

731
01:47:25,445 --> 01:47:27,487
It's time for you to leave.

732
01:47:34,821 --> 01:47:37,988
I embrace you and kiss you from here.

733
01:47:56,740 --> 01:47:58,657
I will always be with you.

734
01:48:05,990 --> 01:48:07,866
Always.

735
01:48:10,533 --> 01:48:12,408
Always.

736
01:49:02,787 --> 01:49:04,662
Why did it come to this?

737
01:49:09,788 --> 01:49:13,079
Would you have done anything differently?

738
01:49:17,121 --> 01:49:20,664
I have always done
what I believed to be right.

739
01:49:40,456 --> 01:49:42,332
I am scared.

740
01:51:47,009 --> 01:51:48,884
Any last words?

741
01:51:49,467 --> 01:51:51,342
I fall.

742
01:51:51,676 --> 01:51:53,551
I lost this battle.

743
01:51:54,010 --> 01:51:55,885
I leave honorably.

744
01:51:57,010 --> 01:51:58,885
I love this country.

745
01:51:58,968 --> 01:52:00,843
I love her people.

746
01:52:01,218 --> 01:52:03,093
I leave without hatred.

747
01:52:22,637 --> 01:52:28,137
<i>My Jana, providence
planned my life in such a way</i>

748
01:52:28,637 --> 01:52:31,013
<i>that I could not give you my all.</i>

749
01:52:31,888 --> 01:52:35,388
<i>But I felt my calling was to do you good</i>

750
01:52:35,930 --> 01:52:39,680
<i>by seeing that all children can live well.</i>

751
01:52:41,263 --> 01:52:44,056
<i>And so, my little girl,</i>

752
01:52:45,181 --> 01:52:49,014
<i>my hope, my future forgiveness.</i>

753
01:52:50,056 --> 01:52:54,390
<i>Live! Grasp life with both hands!</i>

754
01:52:55,140 --> 01:52:59,223
<i>Until my last breath
I shall pray for your happiness.</i>

755
01:52:59,890 --> 01:53:02,807
<i>I shall always be with you.</i>

756
01:53:48,186 --> 01:53:51,769
Tell us about yourself.
You're now a US citizen?

757
01:53:51,852 --> 01:53:54,770
I am sorry for having left you waiting.

758
01:53:56,312 --> 01:53:59,228
This press conference is not about me,

759
01:53:59,728 --> 01:54:02,520
it's about a woman, my mother,

760
01:54:03,478 --> 01:54:07,604
who left a legacy behind
that we can all look up to.

761
01:54:07,771 --> 01:54:10,854
Your mother was an extraordinary woman.

762
01:54:12,313 --> 01:54:14,188
Yes.

763
01:54:15,146 --> 01:54:20,064
She wanted me to be more like her,
but I could never achieve that.

764
01:54:21,272 --> 01:54:27,189
I think it best,
if we hear her last words here today.

765
01:54:34,815 --> 01:54:36,690
Life is hard,

766
01:54:37,731 --> 01:54:39,731
it does not pamper anyone,

767
01:54:40,981 --> 01:54:46,482
and for every time it strokes you
it gives you ten blows.

768
01:54:48,482 --> 01:54:52,816
Man doesn't live alone in this world;

769
01:54:53,816 --> 01:54:59,442
in that there is great happiness,
but also a tremendous responsibility.

770
01:55:01,192 --> 01:55:08,026
Our obligation is not acting selfishly
but rather merging

771
01:55:08,109 --> 01:55:11,109
<i>with the needs and the goals of others.</i>

772
01:55:13,068 --> 01:55:15,359
<i>Learn to be modest.</i>

773
01:55:15,443 --> 01:55:20,610
<i>You will not be unhappy because of
material things you don't have.</i>

774
01:55:21,610 --> 01:55:24,944
<i>When you come to
consider something just,</i>

775
01:55:25,027 --> 01:55:30,778
<i>be so definite
that you can fight and die for it.</i>

776
01:55:33,570 --> 01:55:35,445
<i>Don't feel sorry for me.</i>

777
01:55:36,195 --> 01:55:38,736
<i>I lived a beautiful life.</i>

778
01:55:39,736 --> 01:55:42,529
<i>I accept my punishment humbly.</i>

779
01:55:43,237 --> 01:55:48,321
<i>My conscience is clear
and I believe and pray</i>

780
01:55:48,404 --> 01:55:54,530
<i>that I shall also pass the test
of the higher court, of God.</i>

781
01:55:56,530 --> 01:56:01,530
<i>Go to the meadows,
the fields and the forests,</i>

782
01:56:02,447 --> 01:56:06,489
<i>there in the smell of
the blooming blossoms</i>

783
01:56:06,948 --> 01:56:09,614
<i>you will find a part of me.</i>

784
01:57:19,734 --> 01:57:24,734
