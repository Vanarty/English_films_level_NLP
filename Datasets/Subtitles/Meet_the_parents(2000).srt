1
00:02:22,893 --> 00:02:25,354
I know we haven't been
together that long,

2
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:30,484
but these last ten months
have just been the happiest of my life.

3
00:02:30,609 --> 00:02:34,696
You're not only the person I love,
you're also my best friend,

4
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:37,699
and I want to spend
the rest of my life with you.

5
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:41,787
Will you marry me?

6
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:44,081
Yes.

7
00:02:44,206 --> 00:02:46,667
Seriously.
Do you think that sounds good?

8
00:02:46,792 --> 00:02:49,920
- No! - Really? 'Cause I think
that kinda sums up--

9
00:02:50,045 --> 00:02:54,383
- No!
- Oh? Oh, sorry. Sorry.

10
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:57,678
Sometimes these catheters
can pinch a little bit.

11
00:02:57,761 --> 00:02:59,847
Well, thanks for listening.
I really appreciate it.

12
00:03:01,098 --> 00:03:04,643
You've got a real gentle
touch there, Doctor.

13
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:06,979
She won't be able to say no.

14
00:03:07,062 --> 00:03:11,275
Actually, I'm a nurse.
Doctor'll be right in.

15
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:17,614
- Good luck, Greg.
- Thanks, Kim. - Good luck, buddy.

16
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:27,040
Okay, it's time
for our problem of the week.

17
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:29,835
I want you to pick out
your problem--

18
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:32,754
a problem that's been
bothering you all week--

19
00:03:32,838 --> 00:03:36,884
With your eyes still closed,

20
00:03:36,967 --> 00:03:39,636
I want you to picture
that problem in your mind.

21
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:42,389
Pretend that it's right there
in front of you.

22
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:44,808
Not only are you my best friend,

23
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:49,021
but you're also the person
I wanna spend the rest of my life with.

24
00:03:49,104 --> 00:03:53,025
I love you.
Will you... marry me?

25
00:03:53,108 --> 00:03:57,863
Now I want you to scare your problems away.
I want you to say boo.

26
00:04:03,619 --> 00:04:06,496
All right, you guys are great.

27
00:04:06,622 --> 00:04:09,833
Very good. I will see you guys
after lunch, all right?

28
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:12,586
Hey, Pam, isn't that
your special friend outside?

29
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:16,381
Yeah, I think so.

30
00:04:16,465 --> 00:04:18,425
Why don't you go
talk to him?

31
00:04:18,509 --> 00:04:21,094
- You think I should?
- Yeah.

32
00:04:25,349 --> 00:04:26,475
Come here.

33
00:04:26,475 --> 00:04:27,267
Come here.

34
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:30,854
- Hi, sweetie.
- How you doin'?

35
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:34,066
- What's going on?
- I was in the neighborhood, got off work early.

36
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:36,068
Thought maybe you wanted
to get a bite to eat.

37
00:04:36,151 --> 00:04:38,946
Oh, that's very sweet.
What a nice surprise.

38
00:04:40,072 --> 00:04:42,616
Oh, shoot, I forgot
to change my shoes.

39
00:04:42,741 --> 00:04:45,994
You don't have to change.
I can't resist a man in nurse's shoes.

40
00:04:46,078 --> 00:04:48,330
I know, but I got sneakers
in my backpack.

41
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:51,375
- It'll just take a second.
- Okay.

42
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,944
honey--

43
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:56,630
Pam, I love you.

44
00:04:56,855 --> 00:05:00,092
I love you too.
Come on, sweetie.

45
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:03,303
I got a half hour before I have to be back,
so you wanna go have lunch?

46
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:08,725
- What are you doing?
- Um, nothing.

47
00:05:08,851 --> 00:05:11,270
I just love you so much.

48
00:05:11,353 --> 00:05:15,315
These last ten months
have been the happiest of my life.

49
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:19,604
Yeah, they've been amazing.
What's going on?

50
00:05:19,629 --> 00:05:24,074
Nothing. I just-- I just--
I just feel like we're so close.

51
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:27,953
You're my best friend, and you're also
the woman that I love, and--

52
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:30,497
Are you okay, sweetie?
You're acting so weird.

53
00:05:30,581 --> 00:05:33,041
I'm fine. I just got a crick in my neck.
I was doing C.P.R....

54
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:35,294
...on a 300-pound crack addict
this morning. - Oh, my goodness!

55
00:05:35,377 --> 00:05:37,004
Do you want me to massage
your neck or something?

56
00:05:37,129 --> 00:05:38,672
- No, no, no, I'm fine, I'm good.
- A back rub? Are you sure?

57
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:40,674
Honey, look, your kids--
they're trying to tell you something.

58
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:43,260
- What? Hold on.
- Look!

59
00:05:43,385 --> 00:05:46,763
- Oh, it's my sister. Hello? Hi!
- I'm engaged!

60
00:05:48,223 --> 00:05:51,143
You're engaged! That's wonderful.
Congratulations!

61
00:05:51,226 --> 00:05:55,731
Oh, my God, you're getting
married in two weeks. That's a little soon.

62
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:59,860
Wow, Mom and Dad really don't know
Bob very well. Dad was okay with this?

63
00:05:59,985 --> 00:06:03,322
Well, Bob asked Dad.
Wow, that was very thoughtful of him.

64
00:06:03,405 --> 00:06:05,908
I can't believe he knew
to ask Dad's permission.

65
00:06:08,452 --> 00:06:12,539
I'm just here with Greg.
He's gonna take me out for lunch. He's okay.

66
00:06:12,664 --> 00:06:15,167
Okay, yeah, I know you gotta go.
I love you.

67
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,794
Okay, talk to you soon.
Bye.

68
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:22,007
-So what's going on? What?
Debbie's marrying that guy?
- Yeah, in two weeks.

69
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:24,426
Dr. Bob of Denver.
Isn't that great?

70
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:28,347
Yeah, yeah, that's--
Didn't they just meet like a few months ago?

71
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:30,641
Well, yeah, but, you know, he asked her,
and she said yes.

72
00:06:30,766 --> 00:06:32,976
He asked my dad. He said yes.
Then he asked Debbie.

73
00:06:33,201 --> 00:06:36,939
Huh? Yeah, I overheard that.
So, what, like he had to ask his permission?

74
00:06:37,022 --> 00:06:38,982
No, no, he didn't have to.

75
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:42,444
Bob just understood that Dad appreciates
that kind of thing.

76
00:06:43,728 --> 00:06:46,073
Anyway, Deb said
Dad's crazy about him.

77
00:06:46,198 --> 00:06:49,368
Evidently, Bob bought him, like, the
perfect gift that just won him over.

78
00:06:49,651 --> 00:06:52,204
Really? Huh?
A gift?

79
00:06:53,705 --> 00:06:55,624
Are you sure it's okay
to X-ray this?

80
00:06:55,707 --> 00:06:57,835
Yeah, it's not gonna mutate
or anything.

81
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:04,216
- Uh, sir, that's not gonna fit.
- Wait. Hang on a second.

82
00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:07,678
The bag's too big, guy.
You gotta check it.

83
00:07:09,304 --> 00:07:10,681
Over here.

84
00:07:10,806 --> 00:07:12,683
Raise your arms, sir.

85
00:07:12,808 --> 00:07:15,561
I've got an engagement ring
for my girlfriend in the bag.

86
00:07:15,644 --> 00:07:18,647
I can't open it here. Don't you think
I can just carry it on?

87
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:23,485
Hey, pal, if it ain't fittin' through the
frame, you ain't carryin' it on the plane.

88
00:07:23,569 --> 00:07:27,197
- 531 -- New York La Guardia.
Check it. - Wait, wait!

89
00:07:27,322 --> 00:07:31,410
- Excuse me! - Don't worry.
It'll be waitin' for you on the other side.

90
00:07:32,828 --> 00:07:36,290
<i>Baby, hurry
Don't make me worry</i>

91
00:07:36,415 --> 00:07:38,834
Welcome to New York's
La Guardia Airport.

92
00:07:47,593 --> 00:07:50,137
Excuse me. Hi.

93
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:53,056
You lost my bag, and there's a
two-carat diamond ring inside it.

94
00:07:53,182 --> 00:07:55,626
I didn't lose
your anything, sir.

95
00:07:55,651 --> 00:07:59,188
But put your local address on this form,
and we'll ship it when it surfaces.

96
00:07:59,271 --> 00:08:01,690
And what if it doesn't? Am I supposed
to spend the entire weekend...

97
00:08:01,773 --> 00:08:04,610
with just the clothes
on my back?

98
00:08:06,695 --> 00:08:10,490
It's a great gift. I just thought you
were gonna get them champagne.

99
00:08:10,574 --> 00:08:13,577
Trust me. I think your dad is gonna
be very psyched about this gift.

100
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:15,662
Well, don't forget
he's retired, though.

101
00:08:15,746 --> 00:08:19,333
The guy was in the rare-flower
business for 30 years. I think
he still maintains an interest.

102
00:08:21,043 --> 00:08:23,837
- You make it sound like
they're really hard to please.
- No, not at all!

103
00:08:23,921 --> 00:08:26,465
He's the sweetest man
in the whole world. Just relax!

104
00:08:26,548 --> 00:08:28,592
He's gonna love you.
I promise.

105
00:08:28,717 --> 00:08:30,594
As much as he loves Dr. Bob?

106
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:34,306
Take it easy on the sarcasm.
Humor is entirely wasted on my parents.

107
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:37,351
What, are they Amish?

108
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:43,315
Okay, no jokes.

109
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,985
- What are you doing?
- What?

110
00:08:47,069 --> 00:08:49,988
I told you my dad sees smoking
as a sign of weakness.

111
00:08:50,072 --> 00:08:51,615
Okay, all right,
I'll leave 'em in the car.

112
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:55,811
No, no, no, no, he'll check there.
Oh, gosh.

113
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:01,291
Yeah, the roof is probably
a better idea.

114
00:09:04,035 --> 00:09:06,004
...we're not living together.

115
00:09:06,088 --> 00:09:08,924
- I thought you said you told him.
- Well--

116
00:09:13,428 --> 00:09:17,140
- I missed you so much, Pamcake.
- I missed you too, Flapjack.

117
00:09:25,566 --> 00:09:28,318
Short stack, short stack,
coming up.

118
00:09:29,843 --> 00:09:31,905
Where's my "wittle" girl?

119
00:09:31,989 --> 00:09:36,243
- Mommy! Mom!
- You look so beautiful.

120
00:09:36,326 --> 00:09:38,829
So do you. Look at you.

121
00:09:38,954 --> 00:09:41,165
Oh, I'm sorry.
Mom, Dad, this is Greg.

122
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:44,459
- Hi, Greg. I'm Pam's father, Jack Byrnes.
- Great to finally meet you.

123
00:09:44,585 --> 00:09:47,337
- Good meeting you. - And I'm Dina.
Welcome to Oyster Bay.

124
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:55,971
What are you driving there,
a Ford?

125
00:09:56,054 --> 00:09:57,973
Oh, yeah, it's a Taurus.

126
00:09:58,056 --> 00:10:01,894
We were gonna get a mid-size,
but I figure, hey, we pull down decent bucks.

127
00:10:01,977 --> 00:10:05,439
Might as well go all out,
pop for the full-size.

128
00:10:05,564 --> 00:10:08,400
Sure. Interesting color.
You pick it?

129
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:11,278
Oh, no, the guy at the counter.
Why?

130
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:13,739
Well, they say
geniuses pick green.

131
00:10:15,073 --> 00:10:18,785
- But you didn't pick it.
- Jack!

132
00:10:20,621 --> 00:10:23,790
Oh, yucky.
What smells of old sour milk?

133
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:26,877
- Oh, poor Greg got spit up on by a baby.
- He didn't.

134
00:10:27,002 --> 00:10:30,422
Yeah, he did, Ma, at the lost luggage
counter. The airline lost his bag.

135
00:10:30,506 --> 00:10:32,132
They didn't!

136
00:10:32,216 --> 00:10:33,759
- Yeah.
- Yeah, they did.

137
00:10:33,842 --> 00:10:35,802
- What about you, honey?
- Oh, no, no, no. I carried on.

138
00:10:35,886 --> 00:10:37,804
That's my girl.

139
00:10:40,182 --> 00:10:45,479
It'll turn up, I'm sure.
And anyway, Greg, meanwhile,
anything you need, just ask.

140
00:10:45,562 --> 00:10:49,483
- That's right. Mi casa es su casa.
- Oh, thanks, Jack. You too.

141
00:10:57,999 --> 00:11:01,328
- This is so nice.
- We like it.

142
00:11:02,053 --> 00:11:03,497
Beautiful.

143
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:07,876
Oh, now, Greg, you have
a very unique last name.

144
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:12,589
Um, we were curious,
how do you pronounce it?

145
00:11:12,714 --> 00:11:17,845
Oh, just like it's spelled.
F-O-C-K-E-R.

146
00:11:19,555 --> 00:11:23,642
Focker.
Hmm, Focker. Hmm.

147
00:11:27,062 --> 00:11:29,648
- Oh, I'll get it, honey.
- Oh, thanks, Mom.

148
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:34,111
- Oh, there he is. There's our little guy.
-Jinxy, come here, boy.

149
00:11:34,236 --> 00:11:38,115
Come here, baby. Come to Daddy, Jinxy.
Come on. Come on, Jinxy.

150
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,367
Come here.
Come to Daddy.

151
00:11:40,492 --> 00:11:43,412
Come on.
Taught him that in one week.

152
00:11:43,495 --> 00:11:47,475
This is Pam's cat, Jinxy.
Jinxy, say hello to Greg.

153
00:11:47,558 --> 00:11:49,293
- Hi, Jinx. - Wave to Greg.
- Hello, Jinx.

154
00:11:50,118 --> 00:11:52,462
Attaboy.
That took me another week.

155
00:11:52,588 --> 00:11:55,382
- Oh, my gosh.
- Pam, I didn't know you had a cat.

156
00:11:55,465 --> 00:11:57,801
Yeah, I left him here
when I moved to Chicago.

157
00:11:57,926 --> 00:11:59,803
Your daddy's
found his new best friend.

158
00:11:59,928 --> 00:12:03,697
You won't believe it.
He even taught him to use the potty.

159
00:12:03,849 --> 00:12:06,894
- He did? Dad, that's kinda weird, isn't it?
- What's so weird about it?

160
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:09,897
- Now we don't have to smell
kitty litter all the time. - That's right.

161
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:13,192
That's incredible. How did you teach
the cat to use the toilet?

162
00:12:13,275 --> 00:12:17,321
Oh, that was easy, Greg. I just designed
a litter box to put inside the toilet,

163
00:12:17,446 --> 00:12:20,032
and then once he got used to it,
I took it away.

164
00:12:20,115 --> 00:12:22,492
- Yeah, makes sense.
- But I don't think he likes it.

165
00:12:22,618 --> 00:12:26,163
I mean, every chance he gets,
he tries to dig, squat and bury.

166
00:12:26,288 --> 00:12:28,582
I had to move all my
potted plants off the floor.

167
00:12:28,665 --> 00:12:32,211
Plus, you got another guy
around the house to leave the seat up.

168
00:12:33,962 --> 00:12:37,090
He can't lift the seat, Greg.

169
00:12:37,174 --> 00:12:39,426
- He lacks the strength
and the opposable thumbs. - Yeah.

170
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:43,805
Ah, right. Opposable--
I didn't think about that.

171
00:12:43,889 --> 00:12:47,809
Jinx is strictly a house cat.
Can't let him outside because he
lacks outdoor survival skills.

172
00:12:47,893 --> 00:12:49,937
One of those things,
isn't it, sweetheart?

173
00:12:50,062 --> 00:12:54,825
I don't think Greg will be playing
with Jinxy too much. He hates cats.

174
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:57,986
Pam, I don't hate cats.

175
00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:00,948
I don't-- I don't hate cats.
I just happen to be more of a dog lover.

176
00:13:01,031 --> 00:13:03,116
Yeah, yeah. I am too.

177
00:13:03,242 --> 00:13:05,911
- Well, that's okay if you hate cats, Greg.
- No!

178
00:13:05,994 --> 00:13:09,581
- I don't. I don't hate cats at all.
- That's okay.

179
00:13:09,665 --> 00:13:12,709
Just be honest about it.
There's some things I hate.

180
00:13:12,835 --> 00:13:15,629
I-- I'm being honest.
Really? Like what?

181
00:13:18,006 --> 00:13:20,217
Honey, why don't we let
the kids freshen up, huh?

182
00:13:20,342 --> 00:13:24,805
Greg, you come with me.
We'll get you something to wear
from Jack's closet, okay?

183
00:13:27,391 --> 00:13:30,894
- Yeah?
- I'm so happy you're home, sweetheart.

184
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:32,980
Oh! Me too, Dad.

185
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:40,612
Hey, listen, be nice to this one, okay?
I kinda like him.

186
00:13:40,696 --> 00:13:44,741
- Okay, I'll try.
- Thank you.

187
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:54,710
- Shirt fit okay, Greg?
- Oh, fantastic. Thanks, Jack.

188
00:13:54,835 --> 00:13:56,712
Good.
Tom Collins coming up.

189
00:13:56,837 --> 00:14:00,757
- You know, I wish you hadn't
told your parents I hate cats.
- But you do hate cats.

190
00:14:00,883 --> 00:14:02,885
Yeah, but you didn't have to
tell them right when we met.

191
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:04,887
I know. I'm sorry.
It just kinda slipped out.

192
00:14:05,012 --> 00:14:09,725
- Get your red-hot papooses.
- My goodness, what is that?

193
00:14:09,808 --> 00:14:15,105
Oh, that's just a little something from me.
Go ahead. Open it up.

194
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:18,817
Oh. Look, honey,
Greg brought us a present.

195
00:14:18,901 --> 00:14:20,819
Oh, isn't that nice?

196
00:14:26,539 --> 00:14:27,409
Oh, look at this.

197
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:30,537
It's a flower pot
with the dirt in it.

198
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:35,918
Actually, the real gift is
what's planted in the soil.

199
00:14:36,001 --> 00:14:39,755
The bulb
of a Jerusalem tulip.

200
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:46,720
Which I was told is one of the rarest
and most beautiful flowers in existence.

201
00:14:47,445 --> 00:14:51,183
Oh, right, right,
the Jerusalem--

202
00:14:51,266 --> 00:14:54,728
From the "Jerusales tulipesias" genus.
Yes, yes.

203
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:58,774
Anyway, yeah,

204
00:14:58,899 --> 00:15:01,652
the guy said with regular watering,
it should bloom in about 6 months, so--

205
00:15:01,777 --> 00:15:04,404
Oh, we'll look forward
to that, Greg.

206
00:15:13,027 --> 00:15:15,958
So, Greg, how's your job?

207
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:19,461
Um, good, Pam.
Thanks for asking.

208
00:15:21,255 --> 00:15:23,507
I, uh, I recently
got transferred to triage.

209
00:15:23,632 --> 00:15:25,509
Oh, is that better than a nurse?

210
00:15:25,634 --> 00:15:28,679
No, Mom, triage is
a unit of the E.R.

211
00:15:28,804 --> 00:15:30,973
- It's where all the top nurses work.
- Well--

212
00:15:31,098 --> 00:15:34,726
No, they do.

213
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:38,138
Not many men in your profession, though,
are there, Greg?

214
00:15:38,522 --> 00:15:42,067
No, Jack, not traditionally.

215
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:47,739
Oh, Pam, honey, did you know
that your father started his own business?

216
00:15:47,823 --> 00:15:51,285
Really?
Dad, that's great.

217
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:53,704
Yes, I thought with my knowledge
and experience,

218
00:15:53,829 --> 00:15:55,706
why should I allow
retirement to stop me?

219
00:15:56,531 --> 00:15:58,333
- I really admire that.
- Yeah.

220
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:01,128
So what is it?
What's the new venture?

221
00:16:02,353 --> 00:16:03,797
Let me ask you a question, Greg.

222
00:16:03,881 --> 00:16:05,625
Let's just say
you have kids...

223
00:16:05,708 --> 00:16:09,095
and you wanna get out of the house,
spend a night on the town.

224
00:16:09,678 --> 00:16:12,389
So, you hire a baby-sitter,
someone you think you can trust.

225
00:16:12,514 --> 00:16:15,309
References, work experience--
it all checks out fine.

226
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:18,437
But then how do you
really know for certain...

227
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:21,773
that your loved ones are safe
with this stranger?

228
00:16:21,857 --> 00:16:26,236
I mean, can you ever really trust another
human being, Greg?

229
00:16:28,322 --> 00:16:30,282
Sure, I think so.

230
00:16:30,365 --> 00:16:32,743
No, the answer is you cannot.

231
00:16:34,745 --> 00:16:37,164
Let me show you something.

232
00:16:37,247 --> 00:16:39,500
Take a look at this, Greg.

233
00:16:41,877 --> 00:16:44,463
What's this look like to you?

234
00:16:46,146 --> 00:16:47,299
This looks like
a teddy bear.

235
00:16:48,717 --> 00:16:50,636
Smile, you're on "Nanny Camera."

236
00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:54,473
I've seen these things
advertised on TV.

237
00:16:54,556 --> 00:16:57,100
Oh, no, not like this, you haven't.
Take a look.

238
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,104
Oh, my gosh.
Hi!

239
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:05,984
- Where's the other camera?
- Right here in this decorative artifact.

240
00:17:06,068 --> 00:17:08,695
- Wow, that's great.
- Our cameras are motion-activated,

241
00:17:08,779 --> 00:17:11,031
so they begin taping as soon as
they sense any movement.

242
00:17:11,114 --> 00:17:15,536
We can hide 'em in anything.
We hide 'em in mirrors, lamps,
televisions, you name it.

243
00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:17,538
So no matter where you go,

244
00:17:18,705 --> 00:17:20,958
we'll be watching you.

245
00:17:24,086 --> 00:17:27,673
So, Jack, couldn't this
maybe be construed as illegal?
You know, invasion of privacy?

246
00:17:29,383 --> 00:17:32,386
Trust me, Greg, when you
start having little Fockers running around,

247
00:17:32,511 --> 00:17:34,638
you'll understand the need
for this level of protection.

248
00:17:40,853 --> 00:17:42,771
Impressive, isn't it?

249
00:17:42,855 --> 00:17:43,772
Quite.

250
00:17:45,274 --> 00:17:46,817
- Oh, I'll get that.
- I'll get it. I'll get it.

251
00:17:46,942 --> 00:17:48,569
Honey, I'll get it.

252
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:54,366
Any problem
with the documents?

253
00:17:54,449 --> 00:17:58,078
Okay. I'll meet you at the
Oyster Bay Drugstore in about 20 minutes.

254
00:17:58,162 --> 00:18:00,747
Now you gotta be more careful
when you call here.

255
00:18:00,873 --> 00:18:03,292
If anybody else answers,
just use a Southern accent...

256
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:05,544
and ask for
the vegetarian special, okay?

257
00:18:09,339 --> 00:18:12,134
Oh, that wasn't the airline, was it?

258
00:18:12,217 --> 00:18:14,261
Nope, wrong number.

259
00:18:14,386 --> 00:18:16,847
We're all out of Collins mix,
so I'm gonna make a run for the store.

260
00:18:16,972 --> 00:18:19,224
That's funny.
I thought I just bought some.

261
00:18:19,308 --> 00:18:22,686
You know how that stuff-- it just goes,
so I'll be back in a jiff.

262
00:18:22,811 --> 00:18:25,063
Well, why doesn't Greg
go with you?

263
00:18:27,149 --> 00:18:30,736
Sweetie, you'll need something
in case your suitcase doesn't show up.

264
00:18:30,819 --> 00:18:33,113
- Oh, I'm sure it'll show up.
- Yeah.

265
00:18:33,197 --> 00:18:36,992
You don't wanna take a chance.
You don't have a toothbrush.
Go on, sweetie.

266
00:18:37,075 --> 00:18:41,455
- Yeah.
- Okay, unless you want some privacy.

267
00:18:41,538 --> 00:18:44,500
Why would I need privacy?

268
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:47,377
No, I didn't think you would.

269
00:18:47,503 --> 00:18:49,713
- Okay, let's head out.
- Oh, good.

270
00:18:51,089 --> 00:18:53,008
Bye.

271
00:18:53,091 --> 00:18:57,262
Have fun, you guys.
Pam, he seems wonderful.

272
00:18:57,346 --> 00:19:01,099
- He is. We have the best time together.
- Good.

273
00:19:01,183 --> 00:19:03,852
Now, have you two been

274
00:19:03,977 --> 00:19:06,605
- Mother!
- Oh, thinking about anything permanent.

275
00:19:06,688 --> 00:19:10,192
Oh, I don't know.
I mean, we haven't really discussed it,

276
00:19:10,317 --> 00:19:13,195
but I definitely
have a feeling this is it.

277
00:19:14,178 --> 00:19:17,199
Dad seems to like him.
Don't you think?

278
00:19:17,282 --> 00:19:19,201
Absolutely.

279
00:19:24,623 --> 00:19:26,667
Big day, Saturday.

280
00:19:26,792 --> 00:19:31,964
Yes.
This car is--

281
00:19:32,047 --> 00:19:34,716
You got-- What do you use?
Unleaded? Regular unleaded?

282
00:19:34,842 --> 00:19:36,718
Premium.

283
00:19:41,223 --> 00:19:45,853
Hey, you know, Jack,
now that we have a second to talk,

284
00:19:45,936 --> 00:19:49,398
I just want you to know
how much Pam means to me.

285
00:19:49,523 --> 00:19:51,525
I know-- I know that we haven't been
together that long,

286
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:55,904
but the time that we have spent together
has been really incredible.

287
00:19:56,029 --> 00:19:58,490
Greg, how come
you don't like cats?

288
00:20:00,909 --> 00:20:02,828
I don't not like cats.

289
00:20:02,911 --> 00:20:06,039
I- just--
I just prefer dogs.

290
00:20:06,123 --> 00:20:10,043
I mean, I'm just more of a dog kind of,
you know--

291
00:20:10,127 --> 00:20:15,424
Come home, wagging their little tails,
happy to see you kind of--

292
00:20:15,549 --> 00:20:20,262
You need that assurance?
You prefer an emotionally shallow animal?

293
00:20:22,389 --> 00:20:24,683
You see, Greg,
when you yell at a dog,

294
00:20:24,766 --> 00:20:28,854
his tail will go between
his legs and cover his genitals,
his ears will go down.

295
00:20:28,937 --> 00:20:32,232
A dog is very easy to break,
but cats make you work for their affection.

296
00:20:32,316 --> 00:20:38,155
They don't sell out the way dogs do.

297
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:46,406
You like Peter, Paul and Mary?

298
00:20:47,289 --> 00:20:50,709
Yes, I do. I'm a big fan.

299
00:20:50,792 --> 00:20:54,254
<i>Puff the magic dragon
Dragon</i>

300
00:20:54,379 --> 00:20:57,299
<i>Lived by the sea</i>

301
00:20:57,424 --> 00:21:01,762
- Great song.
- Yeah, one of my favorites.

302
00:21:01,845 --> 00:21:04,431
Who would've thought it wasn't really
about a dragon, huh?

303
00:21:06,415 --> 00:21:07,434
What do you mean?

304
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:12,231
You know,
the whole drug thing.

305
00:21:13,982 --> 00:21:17,319
No, I don't know.
Why don't you tell me?

306
00:21:17,602 --> 00:21:22,783
Some people think that...

307
00:21:22,866 --> 00:21:25,327
to "puff the magic dragon"
means to--

308
00:21:25,452 --> 00:21:28,131
They're really, uh--

309
00:21:28,956 --> 00:21:31,750
to smoke-- to smoke--

310
00:21:31,834 --> 00:21:34,837
a marijuana cigarette.

311
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:38,632
Well, Puff's just the name
of the boy's magical dragon.

312
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,677
Right.

313
00:21:45,222 --> 00:21:47,724
- Are you a pothead, Focker?
- No! No.

314
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:52,062
What?
No, no, no, no, Jack.
No, I'm-- I'm not-- I--

315
00:21:52,187 --> 00:21:54,648
I pass on grass all the time.

316
00:21:54,773 --> 00:21:56,859
- I mean, not all the time.
- Yes or no?

317
00:21:56,984 --> 00:21:58,360
No. Yes. No.

318
00:22:04,908 --> 00:22:08,871
Hey, Greg, I'll meet you back out front
in about... 12 to 15 minutes.

319
00:22:29,224 --> 00:22:32,186
Hey.
How you doing?

320
00:22:32,269 --> 00:22:34,730
Do you have any of those
nicotine patches?

321
00:22:35,513 --> 00:22:39,610
No. We have the gum.

322
00:22:40,736 --> 00:22:43,363
- Great.
- You chew it.

323
00:22:43,447 --> 00:22:46,909
Thank you. Yes, okay.
And what's your most expensive
bottle of champagne?

324
00:22:47,334 --> 00:22:50,162
Mumm's.
It's on sale for 13.95.

325
00:22:50,245 --> 00:22:52,247
Really? That's it?
You don't have, like,

326
00:22:52,372 --> 00:22:55,000
a nice, like, 80 or $100 bottle
of something?

327
00:22:56,919 --> 00:22:58,962
You can get
a whole bunch of Mumm's.

328
00:23:34,122 --> 00:23:36,166
- Focker.
- Hey, Jack. Ready to go?

329
00:23:36,291 --> 00:23:40,337
I've been ready, yeah.
They ran out of Collins mix.

330
00:23:42,047 --> 00:23:46,093
- You been waiting here long?
- No, I was just reading up about...

331
00:23:48,387 --> 00:23:51,723
...pumps.
- Pumps?

332
00:23:51,807 --> 00:23:55,185
Yes. Breast pumps.

333
00:23:57,862 --> 00:24:00,107
I grew up on a farm.

334
00:24:06,154 --> 00:24:08,282
Get your hot buns,
hot patooties.

335
00:24:08,407 --> 00:24:11,118
Wow, Dina,
everything looks fabulous.

336
00:24:11,243 --> 00:24:14,621
It's such a treat for me to have
a home-cooked meal like this.

337
00:24:14,705 --> 00:24:17,124
Dinner at my house usually
consisted of everybody in the kitchen...

338
00:24:17,207 --> 00:24:19,126
fighting over containers
of Chinese food.

339
00:24:19,209 --> 00:24:23,046
You poor thing. What, there wasn't
enough food to go around?

340
00:24:23,172 --> 00:24:27,384
No, there was.
We just never really sat down
like a family like this.

341
00:24:28,909 --> 00:24:31,263
Greg, would you like
to say grace?

342
00:24:32,681 --> 00:24:35,309
Oh, uh, well,
Greg's Jewish, Dad. You know that.

343
00:24:35,392 --> 00:24:40,814
You're telling me Jews don't pray, honey?
Unless you have some objection.

344
00:24:40,898 --> 00:24:43,108
No, no, no, no,
I'd love to.

345
00:24:43,192 --> 00:24:45,110
Pam, come on,
it's not like I'm a rabbi or something.

346
00:24:45,194 --> 00:24:48,614
I said grace
at many a dinner table.

347
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:05,380
Oh dear God,

348
00:25:07,633 --> 00:25:10,636
thank You.

349
00:25:10,719 --> 00:25:15,182
You are such a good God to us,
a kind and gentle...

350
00:25:16,965 --> 00:25:19,686
and accommodating God.

351
00:25:20,938 --> 00:25:23,023
And we thank You, Osweet,

352
00:25:23,106 --> 00:25:26,151
sweet Lord of hosts...

353
00:25:26,235 --> 00:25:28,153
for the...

354
00:25:29,905 --> 00:25:31,990
smorgasbord...

355
00:25:32,074 --> 00:25:36,537
You have so aptly lain
at our table this day...

356
00:25:36,662 --> 00:25:40,374
and each day... by day.

357
00:25:42,793 --> 00:25:45,212
Day by day by day.

358
00:25:46,713 --> 00:25:49,716
Oh dear Lord,

359
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:52,094
three things we pray.

360
00:25:53,971 --> 00:25:55,931
To love Thee more dearly,

361
00:25:56,014 --> 00:26:00,519
to see Thee more clearly,

362
00:26:00,602 --> 00:26:04,064
to follow Thee
more nearly...

363
00:26:04,389 --> 00:26:08,235
day by day...
by day.

364
00:26:08,318 --> 00:26:09,903
Amen.

365
00:26:09,987 --> 00:26:12,573
Oh, Greg, that was lovely.

366
00:26:12,698 --> 00:26:16,368
Thank you, Greg.
That was interesting too.

367
00:26:23,292 --> 00:26:27,921
Oh, that's a-- that's a lovely vase.
That's great.

368
00:26:28,046 --> 00:26:31,842
Let me guess, Jack.
Is that one of your secret cameras too?

369
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:40,851
Greg, that's an urn which holds
the remains of Jack's mother.

370
00:26:40,976 --> 00:26:44,688
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

371
00:26:44,813 --> 00:26:46,690
That's all right.
You didn't know, Greg.

372
00:26:46,815 --> 00:26:49,943
- I'm--
- That's our Gran-gran.

373
00:26:50,068 --> 00:26:54,490
We like to think of her
as watching over us as we eat.

374
00:26:54,573 --> 00:26:56,950
Love you, Ma.
Miss you.

375
00:26:57,034 --> 00:26:58,785
Miss you every day.

376
00:26:59,711 --> 00:27:02,206
Oh, honey, why don't you
read Greg your poem?

377
00:27:02,331 --> 00:27:04,416
Oh, no, he doesn't want
to hear that.

378
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:06,418
What? No!
What-What-What poem?

379
00:27:06,502 --> 00:27:09,254
You see,
when Jack had to retire...

380
00:27:09,338 --> 00:27:11,965
...for health reasons--
- That's a bunch of malarky.
Honey, I'm fine.

381
00:27:12,049 --> 00:27:15,010
The doctor thought it would be
therapeutic if he...

382
00:27:15,093 --> 00:27:17,429
sort of expressed his emotions
in an artistic way.

383
00:27:17,513 --> 00:27:21,642
Honey, you wrote the most beautiful poem
about your mother.

384
00:27:21,725 --> 00:27:23,644
Please, we really
wanna hear it.

385
00:27:23,727 --> 00:27:26,313
- Poem, poem.
- Please!

386
00:27:26,396 --> 00:27:30,317
Oh, all right.
It's a work in progress.

387
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,778
I'm still not happy with it.

388
00:27:32,861 --> 00:27:35,155
As soon as it's ready,

389
00:27:35,239 --> 00:27:39,117
then I am going to glaze it
onto a plate...

390
00:27:39,201 --> 00:27:41,328
...and put it next to the urn.
- Nice.

391
00:27:41,411 --> 00:27:43,288
It's very special.

392
00:27:43,372 --> 00:27:47,793
"My Mother"
by Jack Byrnes.

393
00:27:49,503 --> 00:27:52,172
"You gave me life,
you gave me milk,

394
00:27:52,297 --> 00:27:54,466
'you gave me courage.

395
00:27:54,550 --> 00:28:00,430
"Your name was Angela,
the angel from heaven,

396
00:28:00,556 --> 00:28:04,601
"but you were also an angel of God,
and He needed you too.

397
00:28:04,726 --> 00:28:07,980
"Selfishly I tried
to keep you here...

398
00:28:08,063 --> 00:28:10,691
"while the cancer
ate away your organs...

399
00:28:10,816 --> 00:28:13,026
"like an unstoppable
rebel force.

400
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:18,866
"But I couldn't save you,
and I shall see your face...

401
00:28:18,949 --> 00:28:23,120
"nevermore, nevermore,

402
00:28:23,245 --> 00:28:26,081
"nevermore,

403
00:28:26,165 --> 00:28:30,377
until we meet...
in heaven."

404
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:34,047
Daddy, that's beautiful.

405
00:28:34,131 --> 00:28:37,217
It always gets me.
Amazing. So-So--

406
00:28:37,301 --> 00:28:41,847
So much love, yet also
so much information.

407
00:28:43,432 --> 00:28:45,350
It takes a lot out of him.

408
00:28:47,352 --> 00:28:51,481
- Greg, would you like some yams?
- Thank you. Oh, yeah.

409
00:28:51,607 --> 00:28:54,918
You must've had vegetables fresher
than that, growing up on a farm, Greg.

410
00:28:55,843 --> 00:28:58,572
Dad, Greg grew up in Detroit.

411
00:28:59,055 --> 00:29:01,533
He told me he grew up on a farm.

412
00:29:03,494 --> 00:29:06,788
- Do they have many farms in Detroit?
- No, Dina, no, not a lot.

413
00:29:06,914 --> 00:29:08,790
In fact, Jack,
I should clarify this.

414
00:29:08,916 --> 00:29:13,086
I didn't actually grow up...
on a farm per se.

415
00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:16,673
The house we grew up in
was originally erected...

416
00:29:16,798 --> 00:29:19,885
in the early Dutch farm,
colonial style.

417
00:29:19,968 --> 00:29:23,514
So that, plus we had
a lot of pets--

418
00:29:26,517 --> 00:29:29,478
- Which one did you milk then?
- Dad!

419
00:29:29,561 --> 00:29:31,939
Honey, he said he pumped milk.

420
00:29:32,322 --> 00:29:34,775
What have you ever milked?

421
00:29:37,194 --> 00:29:39,404
A cat.

422
00:29:39,488 --> 00:29:42,407
A cat?

423
00:29:42,491 --> 00:29:47,788
- I milked a cat once.
You wanna hear a story? - Sure.

424
00:29:47,871 --> 00:29:53,460
My sister had a cat, and the cat birthed
a litter of kittens.

425
00:29:53,585 --> 00:29:56,547
Must've been 30 of them,
and there was this one little runt...

426
00:29:56,672 --> 00:29:59,800
this little sweet little...
little-engine-that-could runt...

427
00:29:59,925 --> 00:30:03,595
who wanted to get up there
and couldn't really get access
to the-- to the--

428
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:07,224
to the-- to the--
to the teat.

429
00:30:07,349 --> 00:30:09,101
Teat?

430
00:30:09,184 --> 00:30:11,103
Dad.
What have you.

431
00:30:11,186 --> 00:30:16,567
I went in and just simply,
you know, just--

432
00:30:20,195 --> 00:30:23,157
into a little saucer,

433
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:28,120
then took the saucer and fed it to
Geppetto-- that's what I named him.

434
00:30:28,203 --> 00:30:30,998
I had-- I had no idea
you could milk a cat.

435
00:30:31,123 --> 00:30:33,458
Oh, yeah, you can milk
anything with nipples.

436
00:30:36,628 --> 00:30:39,006
I have nipples, Greg.
Could you milk me?

437
00:30:39,089 --> 00:30:41,967
Okay, could we change
the subject perhaps?

438
00:30:43,802 --> 00:30:45,721
- Champagne, champagne.
- Yes.

439
00:30:45,804 --> 00:30:48,765
- I thought maybe we could
celebrate with a little bubbly.
- That'd be great.

440
00:30:48,891 --> 00:30:50,434
Good idea.
Yum!

441
00:30:59,234 --> 00:31:01,153
"I have nipples.
Can you milk me?"

442
00:31:01,236 --> 00:31:04,656
Well, in a funny way,
you've already seen Deb's ring.

443
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:06,867
That's true.

444
00:31:07,492 --> 00:31:12,206
Would anybody care for a bottle
of Oyster Bay Drug and Sundries
finest champagne?

445
00:31:12,289 --> 00:31:15,876
That is so sweet of you, Greg.
Isn't that a nice gesture?

446
00:31:16,001 --> 00:31:20,130
- That's very nice.
- How could I have seen Debbie's ring, Mom?

447
00:31:20,255 --> 00:31:23,008
Well, when I gave Bob
the okay to propose to Deb,

448
00:31:23,091 --> 00:31:25,177
I put him in touch
with my diamond guy,

449
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:27,888
and he picked out the same design
Kevin gave you.

450
00:31:30,265 --> 00:31:32,976
- Kevin, your old boyfriend?
- Thanks, Dad.

451
00:31:33,101 --> 00:31:36,021
Well, yeah,
Kevin was Pam's fiance.

452
00:31:42,826 --> 00:31:43,695
Oh, my God.

453
00:31:46,824 --> 00:31:48,742
- Oh!
-Jinxy, no!

454
00:31:54,873 --> 00:31:57,334
Greg, sweetie,
how you doing?

455
00:31:57,459 --> 00:32:01,588
Oh, just fine, considering I desecrated
your grandma's remains,

456
00:32:01,713 --> 00:32:05,759
found out you were engaged
and had your father ask me to milk him.

457
00:32:05,884 --> 00:32:07,928
At least back then he was
still talking to me.

458
00:32:08,053 --> 00:32:11,765
- I can't believe you didn't
tell me you were that close.
- Who, Daddy and me?

459
00:32:11,849 --> 00:32:13,934
No, Kevin and you.

460
00:32:14,017 --> 00:32:15,936
Do we have to know everything
about each other's pasts?

461
00:32:16,019 --> 00:32:19,606
You never told me about
your cat-milking days in Motown.

462
00:32:20,816 --> 00:32:22,734
That was
a long time ago, Pam.

463
00:32:22,818 --> 00:32:24,987
Yeah, okay, well,
so was this.

464
00:32:25,112 --> 00:32:30,993
Kevin's and my connection
was more physical than anything else.

465
00:32:31,076 --> 00:32:35,205
Physical? Like what?
Like you worked out together?

466
00:32:35,330 --> 00:32:40,694
No, no, it was nothing, nothing.
It was a stupid sexual thing.

467
00:32:40,878 --> 00:32:43,088
I'm gonna go throw up now.

468
00:32:43,672 --> 00:32:45,090
Greg, listen.

469
00:32:45,174 --> 00:32:49,261
Kevin and I were only engaged
for a month before I realized
that I'd made a mistake, okay?

470
00:32:49,344 --> 00:32:52,181
I gave back the ring,
I moved to Chicago,

471
00:32:52,306 --> 00:32:55,809
and I met and fell in love with you, okay,
so can we please drop this?

472
00:32:58,896 --> 00:33:02,149
- Good. - I just feel like this
is not going well at all.

473
00:33:02,232 --> 00:33:05,652
- I feel like your dad hates me.
- He doesn't hate you, sweetie.

474
00:33:05,736 --> 00:33:08,530
Come on. Just give him
a chance, all right?

475
00:33:08,655 --> 00:33:10,532
Maybe he's nervous too, huh?

476
00:33:10,657 --> 00:33:15,078
I thought he would love my gift,
you know, being this big flower guy,

477
00:33:15,204 --> 00:33:18,457
but it's like he didn't
even show the slightest bit of interest.

478
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:22,461
Listen to me.
Forget the gift.

479
00:33:22,544 --> 00:33:27,132
You are the most adorable,
loving, sweetest man in the whole world,

480
00:33:27,216 --> 00:33:29,635
and I love you.

481
00:33:29,718 --> 00:33:32,179
And very soon my parents
are gonna see that...

482
00:33:32,262 --> 00:33:34,431
and grow to love you too, okay?

483
00:33:38,727 --> 00:33:41,480
Speaking of growing
to love you--

484
00:33:41,563 --> 00:33:43,857
- Honey, it's late.
- I know it's late.

485
00:33:43,941 --> 00:33:47,152
But Mr. Winky is still
on Chicago time,

486
00:33:47,236 --> 00:33:51,114
and we both know there's only one way
to make Mr. Winky go away.

487
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:55,386
And there it is.

488
00:33:59,956 --> 00:34:01,625
What's with the robe?

489
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:05,337
It's Pam's. My pajamas are in the suitcase
with everything else.

490
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:09,716
- Hey, I'll lend you a pair of Jack's.
Okay, honey? - Sure.

491
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,510
- You don't have to do that,
- Oh, no, no, no.

492
00:34:11,593 --> 00:34:13,387
No, that's fine.
We have to.

493
00:34:13,470 --> 00:34:16,223
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

494
00:34:16,306 --> 00:34:19,268
Look, Greg, I just wanna say, don't worry
about what happened tonight.

495
00:34:20,644 --> 00:34:24,731
Oh, thanks, Jack.
Still, I feel horrible. I mean--

496
00:34:25,657 --> 00:34:27,276
Well, it was
a horrible thing.

497
00:34:31,113 --> 00:34:35,450
But let's just put all that behind us
and enjoy our weekend together.

498
00:34:36,234 --> 00:34:40,038
Okay. Okay.
Thank you, Daddy.

499
00:34:41,790 --> 00:34:43,709
- Oh, thank you.
- Thanks, Mom.

500
00:34:43,792 --> 00:34:45,586
- These'll do just fine.
- Good night.

501
00:34:45,711 --> 00:34:47,087
Night-night.

502
00:34:47,171 --> 00:34:50,716
Good night, sweetie.
See you in the morning.

503
00:34:50,799 --> 00:34:53,302
- Have a nice sleep.
- Okay, you too.

504
00:34:53,385 --> 00:34:58,599
Oh, no, no, no, Greg, we made up
the pullout for you down in the den.

505
00:34:58,682 --> 00:35:03,061
Oh, okay, 'cause Pam said
I should sleep in Debbie's room.

506
00:35:03,145 --> 00:35:06,315
Well, Debbie'll be
sleeping here tomorrow.

507
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,650
This way, you'll have more privacy,
you'll have your own bathroom.

508
00:35:08,775 --> 00:35:12,446
Just try not to flush the toilet.
It's always a little quirky.

509
00:35:12,571 --> 00:35:16,116
- Okay.
- Oh, one more thing.

510
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:20,871
I'm a realist. I understand it's
the 21st century,

511
00:35:20,996 --> 00:35:23,457
and you've probably had
premarital relations with my daughter.

512
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,587
But under our roof, it's my way
or the Long Island Expressway.

513
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:31,965
- Is that understood?
- Of course, yeah.

514
00:35:32,049 --> 00:35:35,010
Good. Keep your snake
in its cage for 72 hours.

515
00:35:36,428 --> 00:35:38,347
Okay.

516
00:35:42,935 --> 00:35:46,313
Welcome to Atlantic American Airways'
Lost Luggage Department.

517
00:35:46,396 --> 00:35:50,150
At Atlantic American Airways,
customer satisfaction always comes first.

518
00:35:50,234 --> 00:35:52,319
We are experiencing
heavy call volume.

519
00:35:52,444 --> 00:35:57,658
Your call is very important to us.
It will be answered in approximately 27 minutes.

520
00:35:57,741 --> 00:36:00,828
Please press "1" if you'd like
to talk to a representative

521
00:36:00,911 --> 00:36:03,622
We are closed for the night.
Please call back--

522
00:36:09,253 --> 00:36:11,171
Sorry.

523
00:36:14,091 --> 00:36:17,886
I don't know what it is,
but there's just something
about him that's a little off.

524
00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:20,722
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Jack, you know we've been
through this...

525
00:36:20,806 --> 00:36:25,769
with every boyfriend Pam has had
since, what, middle school.

526
00:36:25,853 --> 00:36:29,857
I think Greg--
he's a lovely young man.

527
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:33,026
And, honey, Pam thinks
he might be the one.

528
00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:37,156
She said that?
She said those exact words?

529
00:36:37,281 --> 00:36:40,242
I didn't tape record it, Jack,
but that's the impression.

530
00:36:44,788 --> 00:36:48,625
What kind of a family doesn't have time
to sit down for dinner?

531
00:36:48,709 --> 00:36:52,546
- Fugitives.
- Please try to enjoy the weekend, honey.

532
00:36:52,629 --> 00:36:56,258
- Both our daughters are in love.
- That's what I'm worried about.

533
00:37:00,554 --> 00:37:02,806
- Oh, geez, I just realized something.
- What?

534
00:37:02,931 --> 00:37:05,309
Pam's middle name.
Martha.

535
00:37:08,337 --> 00:37:10,397
Pamela Martha Focker.

536
00:38:10,082 --> 00:38:12,334
"Operation Ko Samui"?

537
00:38:21,926 --> 00:38:23,512
Looking for something,
Greg?

538
00:38:24,637 --> 00:38:27,808
Jesus, Jack, you scared me.

539
00:38:27,891 --> 00:38:31,812
I heard a noise, so I came down
to see if everything was okay.

540
00:38:31,895 --> 00:38:35,691
Everything's fine. I just-- I'm sorry.
I saw a light on, and I kinda stumbled in.

541
00:38:35,774 --> 00:38:39,153
- I didn't realize--
- That's okay. See anything interesting?

542
00:38:39,236 --> 00:38:42,656
No, not at all.
I mean, I mean--

543
00:38:42,739 --> 00:38:47,286
I mean, this is great, though.
I love this-- what you-- it's a cozy little nook.

544
00:38:47,411 --> 00:38:49,538
I noticed you were looking
at that when I came in.

545
00:38:51,832 --> 00:38:55,002
- Yeah. - It's an antique
polygraph machine.

546
00:38:55,085 --> 00:38:57,880
Is that what that is?
I've seen these before,

547
00:38:58,005 --> 00:38:59,965
but I never saw one
actually up close.

548
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:05,429
You know what?
Why don't you try that on?

549
00:39:06,412 --> 00:39:08,182
Oh, that's okay.

550
00:39:08,265 --> 00:39:11,268
Oh, come on. We'll have some fun.
I'll show you how it works.

551
00:39:11,351 --> 00:39:12,895
I shouldn't.

552
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:16,064
- Why should you be afraid?
You have nothing to hide. - No, I know.

553
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:19,026
- I know you know, so there
shouldn't be any problem.
- No, there's no problem.

554
00:39:19,109 --> 00:39:22,738
- So, try it on.
- Okay.

555
00:39:22,821 --> 00:39:24,408
I'll help you.

556
00:39:32,623 --> 00:39:34,625
Don't worry.
You'll enjoy this.

557
00:39:36,793 --> 00:39:40,047
All right.

558
00:39:40,130 --> 00:39:43,926
Looks complicated.
Now these aren't 100% accurate, right?

559
00:39:44,051 --> 00:39:47,387
- They're--
You'd be surprised how accurate they are.

560
00:39:47,471 --> 00:39:49,973
They can tell fairly easily
if someone's lying or not.

561
00:39:51,558 --> 00:39:53,894
Now I'm gonna ask you
some questions,

562
00:39:53,977 --> 00:39:55,896
and all you have to do
is answer "yes" or "no."

563
00:39:55,979 --> 00:39:58,482
- Okay.
- All right.

564
00:39:58,565 --> 00:40:00,484
Let's give it a whirl.

565
00:40:01,902 --> 00:40:04,363
Did you fly on an airplane today?

566
00:40:04,488 --> 00:40:07,908
- Yes, I did.
- No peeking.

567
00:40:08,033 --> 00:40:13,121
- Did we eat pot roast
for dinner tonight? - Yes.

568
00:40:13,247 --> 00:40:15,165
Was it under-cooked?

569
00:40:18,377 --> 00:40:20,295
No, it was rare.

570
00:40:20,379 --> 00:40:24,216
It was a little rare
for my taste.

571
00:40:24,341 --> 00:40:27,886
- But I wouldn't--
- I'm just kidding, I'm just--

572
00:40:30,806 --> 00:40:33,475
Relax. Relax.
The needles are jumping.

573
00:40:35,352 --> 00:40:38,814
Have you ever watched
pornographic videos?

574
00:40:47,865 --> 00:40:51,243
- I mean, well, I don't--
- Yes or no?

575
00:41:06,925 --> 00:41:09,678
What's the matter?
You can't sleep?

576
00:41:09,761 --> 00:41:14,474
No, no, I'm just going over some
of my answers from the polygraph
test your dad gave me.

577
00:41:14,558 --> 00:41:17,269
- Oh, no, he didn't.
- Yeah, he did.

578
00:41:17,394 --> 00:41:19,688
Well, did you lie to him?

579
00:41:19,771 --> 00:41:22,941
No! I mean--
Well, he asked me if
we were living together,

580
00:41:23,066 --> 00:41:25,527
and--
What'd you tell him?

581
00:41:25,652 --> 00:41:27,571
Nothing.
Your mother walked in...

582
00:41:27,654 --> 00:41:30,699
and yanked the little thingies
off before I had to answer.

583
00:41:30,824 --> 00:41:34,203
Is this how you'd react
if I told you he shoved bamboo
shoots up my fingernails?

584
00:41:34,286 --> 00:41:38,665
Or does he hook all your boyfriends up
to his little machine?

585
00:41:38,749 --> 00:41:42,002
Well, he doesn't need a machine.
He's a human lie detector.

586
00:41:42,085 --> 00:41:46,715
- What? - Greg, my father was never
in the rare flower business.

587
00:41:46,798 --> 00:41:49,760
That was just his cover.

588
00:41:49,843 --> 00:41:52,763
He was in the C.I.A.
for 34 years.

589
00:41:52,846 --> 00:41:54,681
How could you not tell me this?

590
00:41:55,933 --> 00:41:58,143
I wanted to, honey,
but it was strictly...

591
00:41:58,268 --> 00:42:01,313
on a need-to-know basis.

592
00:42:03,690 --> 00:42:06,860
So, what? He's in the C.I.A.?
He was a spy? He is a spy?

593
00:42:06,944 --> 00:42:09,238
No, he was more like
a psychological profiler.

594
00:42:09,363 --> 00:42:12,574
They used him to interrogate
suspected double agents in the company.

595
00:42:12,699 --> 00:42:14,827
Oh, that's great.
Yeah.

596
00:42:14,952 --> 00:42:17,287
I was scared of your dad
back when I thought he was a florist.

597
00:42:17,412 --> 00:42:20,582
It's wonderful to know that I've actually got
a C.I.A. spy-hunter on my ass.

598
00:42:20,707 --> 00:42:24,586
Would you stop?
You're doing great, okay?

599
00:42:24,670 --> 00:42:27,756
This is a lot to take in, honey.
I'm sorry.

600
00:42:27,881 --> 00:42:31,927
- It's just weird.
- Oh, I know, but you're doing fine.

601
00:42:32,010 --> 00:42:34,088
I promise.

602
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:43,939
- Mm, no, no!
- W-What's wrong, sweetie?

603
00:42:44,022 --> 00:42:47,734
I forgot. I'm not supposed to let
the snake out of my cage.

604
00:42:48,518 --> 00:42:49,361
Your what?

605
00:42:49,486 --> 00:42:51,780
I told your dad I wouldn't touch you
for 72 hours.

606
00:42:51,864 --> 00:42:54,908
Okay, I'm not in junior high
anymore, so-- No, no, no.

607
00:42:54,992 --> 00:42:58,036
Seriously. I want to try
to respect his rules, okay?

608
00:42:58,162 --> 00:43:00,789
Okay. Fine.

609
00:43:00,873 --> 00:43:04,960
Uh, why don't you go ahead
and get some sleep,
and I'll see you in the morning.

610
00:43:18,015 --> 00:43:21,768
- Morning, Greg.
- Good morning.

611
00:43:21,852 --> 00:43:25,981
Pam told me she let you in
on a little secret of mine last night.

612
00:43:26,964 --> 00:43:28,817
Yes, she did.

613
00:43:29,742 --> 00:43:32,654
Well, as long as you can keep your
mouth shut for the rest of your life,

614
00:43:32,779 --> 00:43:35,115
you're in no immediate danger.

615
00:43:37,034 --> 00:43:38,952
I won't tell.

616
00:43:40,204 --> 00:43:42,080
I'm just being humorous.

617
00:43:43,290 --> 00:43:45,209
Huh. That was funny.

618
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:50,005
But the fact is, Greg, with the knowledge
you've been given,

619
00:43:50,130 --> 00:43:53,175
you are now on the inside
of what I like to call...

620
00:43:53,258 --> 00:43:57,137
"the Byrnes family
circle of trust."

621
00:43:57,221 --> 00:44:00,098
I keep nothing from you,
you keep nothing from me...

622
00:44:00,224 --> 00:44:03,018
and round and round we go.

623
00:44:03,101 --> 00:44:07,439
Okay.
Understood.

624
00:44:08,982 --> 00:44:12,861
Okay, good. Come on. Let's go inside
and have breakfast.

625
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:20,786
Jinxy cat, Jinxy cat
where are you

626
00:44:20,911 --> 00:44:23,705
I love you

627
00:44:23,789 --> 00:44:27,376
Jinxy. Jinxy.

628
00:44:27,501 --> 00:44:29,711
Not at the table,
honey, please.

629
00:44:29,837 --> 00:44:34,216
- Attaboy!
- Hey, hey, look who's up!

630
00:44:34,299 --> 00:44:35,843
- Hi, sweetie.
- You must be Greg.

631
00:44:35,926 --> 00:44:40,722
- Hello. - Oh, look, somebody had a visit
from the hair fairy.

632
00:44:40,806 --> 00:44:44,560
- Oh, yes.
- Nice 'do, nice 'do.

633
00:44:44,643 --> 00:44:46,854
I'll do the intros.
Greg, this is my sister, Debbie.

634
00:44:46,937 --> 00:44:48,856
- Hi. - Nice to meet you.
Oh, the bride to be.

635
00:44:48,939 --> 00:44:51,400
- Congratulations.
- And her fiancée, Dr. Bob.

636
00:44:51,483 --> 00:44:53,735
You can call me
Bob... M.D.

637
00:44:53,861 --> 00:44:57,406
- These are his parents, Linda Banks,
- Hi. How are you?

638
00:44:57,407 --> 00:44:59,607
- Nice to meet you.
...and the world-famous plastic surgeon...

639
00:44:59,608 --> 00:45:00,608
Dr. Larry.

640
00:45:00,993 --> 00:45:03,412
Whoa, now, cut that out.

641
00:45:04,955 --> 00:45:06,915
You know, Greg's
in medicine, too, Larry.

642
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:09,960
- Oh, really? What field?
- Nursing.

643
00:45:11,143 --> 00:45:12,546
That's good.

644
00:45:12,629 --> 00:45:15,757
No, really.
What field?

645
00:45:15,883 --> 00:45:17,801
Nursing.

646
00:45:20,721 --> 00:45:24,433
Hey, why don't I get you
a chair, Greg?

647
00:45:24,516 --> 00:45:26,977
Thank you.
Thanks.

648
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:29,980
So, you didn't want
to go for the M.D.?

649
00:45:30,063 --> 00:45:34,026
No, I actually thought
about becoming a doctor,
but I decided it wasn't for me.

650
00:45:34,151 --> 00:45:36,028
Just as well.
Boards are killer.

651
00:45:36,153 --> 00:45:38,906
Actually Greg aced
his MCATs.

652
00:45:38,989 --> 00:45:41,241
- You serious?
- No, I did okay.

653
00:45:41,325 --> 00:45:43,619
Oh, he did more than okay.
Trust me.

654
00:45:43,702 --> 00:45:46,747
Why did you take the test
if you weren't planning
on going to med school?

655
00:45:46,830 --> 00:45:48,916
Well, I wanted to keep
my options open,

656
00:45:48,999 --> 00:45:51,001
but in the end,
nursing was a better fit for me.

657
00:45:51,084 --> 00:45:54,004
It gives you the freedom to work
in several different areas of medicine.

658
00:45:54,087 --> 00:45:56,048
Plus, I can focus
100% on patient care,

659
00:45:56,173 --> 00:45:58,592
as opposed to being a doctor where
you have to deal with the bureaucracy.

660
00:45:58,675 --> 00:46:02,054
- Wasn't your friend Andy
supposed to be here by now?
- Oh, my God!

661
00:46:02,179 --> 00:46:07,100
I thought Deb told you.
Dr. Andy threw out his back.
He can't make the wedding.

662
00:46:07,184 --> 00:46:10,312
Oh, damn. Now I have to reconfigure
the whole procession.

663
00:46:11,495 --> 00:46:15,150
Bob, why doesn't Greg
stand in for Andy, be the usher?

664
00:46:15,275 --> 00:46:19,988
- Oh! No, Pam, no. - That'll be fine.
Bob, Greg'll be your second usher.

665
00:46:20,113 --> 00:46:24,660
- Good. - Uh, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, okay, sure.

666
00:46:24,743 --> 00:46:27,397
Good. Let's all finish up
and get ready to go...

667
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:32,251
...because we have a pre-activity
briefing in about 32 minutes.
- Thirty-two minutes!

668
00:46:32,376 --> 00:46:35,254
You know what? In that case,
I'd better get upstairs...

669
00:46:35,379 --> 00:46:38,006
and pay a little visit
to the shower fairy.

670
00:46:42,302 --> 00:46:44,221
Dina, thank you so much
for breakfast.

671
00:46:48,475 --> 00:46:51,520
Hey, you okay?
Why didn't you wake me up?

672
00:46:51,603 --> 00:46:55,440
- Because I thought you'd like to sleep late.
- Not when I'm a guest.

673
00:46:55,566 --> 00:46:57,943
- It's okay. Don't worry about it.
- No, it's not okay.

674
00:46:58,068 --> 00:47:01,113
Tell that to Dr. Torquemada in there
with the Grand Inquisition.

675
00:47:01,238 --> 00:47:03,615
Go take a shower, get dressed
and come back down.

676
00:47:03,740 --> 00:47:07,035
- Get dressed in what?
- Borrow some more of Dad's clothes.

677
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:09,705
- No, I don't-- Come on.
- Why not, honey?

678
00:47:09,830 --> 00:47:13,542
I just-- No, I don't feel comfortable
wearing your dad's underwear.

679
00:47:13,667 --> 00:47:16,545
Okay, well, go wake up Denny
and borrow some of his.

680
00:47:16,628 --> 00:47:18,547
You want me to go wake up
your brother who I never met...

681
00:47:18,630 --> 00:47:21,967
and ask if I could have
some of his clothes?

682
00:47:22,092 --> 00:47:27,139
Okay, all right. Where's Denny's room?
Top of the stairs, turn right.

683
00:47:43,489 --> 00:47:46,408
Hello?
Hello?

684
00:48:01,488 --> 00:48:02,591
What the hell you doing in here?

685
00:48:02,674 --> 00:48:05,010
I'm-- I'm Greg,
Pam's friend.

686
00:48:05,135 --> 00:48:07,262
What? Were you just
sniffing my boxers, dude?

687
00:48:07,346 --> 00:48:11,350
No, dude, no. No, no, she said
I could come up here,

688
00:48:11,475 --> 00:48:13,435
...maybe borrow some clothes from you.
- Do me a favor. Close the door.

689
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:15,479
- Okay.
- Quick.

690
00:48:17,064 --> 00:48:20,734
- Tell anybody I wasn't here?
- No, they think you're asleep.

691
00:48:20,818 --> 00:48:24,238
- Yeah, so, it's all good.
- You scared me.

692
00:48:31,370 --> 00:48:34,581
Dad keeps you guys under
a pretty close watch, huh?

693
00:48:34,665 --> 00:48:40,087
No, it's not that bad. Your little Pamcake's
got it a lot worse than I do.

694
00:48:40,170 --> 00:48:44,716
- Oh! You need some clothes.
- Yes, that would be-- that would be great.

695
00:48:44,842 --> 00:48:47,886
- Glad to hook you up.
- Cool. - All right?

696
00:48:48,211 --> 00:48:50,973
Like what you done
with the crib.

697
00:48:52,498 --> 00:48:54,142
Oh, Lil' Kim.

698
00:48:54,726 --> 00:48:56,586
She's phat.

699
00:49:00,983 --> 00:49:02,985
P-H phat.

700
00:49:03,110 --> 00:49:05,112
Yeah, I think these ought a do it.
All right, here you go, chief.

701
00:49:05,195 --> 00:49:07,114
- All right!
- Enjoy!

702
00:49:07,197 --> 00:49:09,199
- Thanks a lot, Denny.
- No problem.

703
00:49:09,324 --> 00:49:13,162
Oh, and don't worry
about the little covert op, all right?

704
00:49:13,287 --> 00:49:15,247
- I'll keep it on the lowdown.
- Down low.

705
00:49:15,372 --> 00:49:19,126
No doubt.

706
00:49:19,209 --> 00:49:21,920
People, people, come get
your revised itineraries.

707
00:49:22,045 --> 00:49:26,300
Larry, Linda,
Debbie, Bob, honey.

708
00:49:26,383 --> 00:49:30,429
Now, I'm gonna activate the alarm.
It'll go off in T minus 16 seconds.

709
00:49:30,554 --> 00:49:32,681
- I don't think I need a jacket.
- It's cold out, honey.

710
00:49:32,806 --> 00:49:35,851
Hold on.
Here, take Denny's jacket.

711
00:49:39,396 --> 00:49:42,399
Hey, Denny, I'm lending Greg
your jacket, okay? Whatever.

712
00:49:42,524 --> 00:49:44,401
Let's go.

713
00:49:57,581 --> 00:50:00,209
Denny, how's the tux fit?

714
00:50:00,292 --> 00:50:03,253
- Dad, uh--
- What's that?

715
00:50:03,378 --> 00:50:05,839
I-It's a sculpture
I found in Greg's jacket.

716
00:50:08,884 --> 00:50:12,471
This isn't a sculpture, Denny.
This is a device for smoking marijuana.

717
00:50:13,639 --> 00:50:15,557
Really?

718
00:50:17,267 --> 00:50:20,646
Not mine.
It's not.

719
00:50:23,649 --> 00:50:26,401
Oh, hey, Jack.
How you doing?

720
00:50:28,278 --> 00:50:31,698
I like the top hat.
Complements you.

721
00:50:31,824 --> 00:50:34,743
Can I talk to you
for a minute?

722
00:50:38,288 --> 00:50:40,165
Sit down.

723
00:50:44,419 --> 00:50:48,173
Did I not clearly explain
the circle of trust to you, Greg?

724
00:50:48,298 --> 00:50:51,009
Mm, yeah, I think I got it.

725
00:50:51,134 --> 00:50:53,720
Then is there something
you wanna tell me?

726
00:50:53,804 --> 00:50:56,223
I don't think so.

727
00:50:56,306 --> 00:51:00,602
Didn't we have a discussion yesterday
in the car about this?

728
00:51:00,686 --> 00:51:02,855
Oh, yes!
You mean-- Yes!

729
00:51:02,980 --> 00:51:05,149
You mean me and Pam.
Yes, I would love to talk to you about that.

730
00:51:05,274 --> 00:51:07,651
We're not talking about Pam.
We're talking about you.

731
00:51:07,734 --> 00:51:11,196
See, if I can't trust you,
Greg, then I have no choice...

732
00:51:11,321 --> 00:51:13,240
but to put you right back
outside the circle.

733
00:51:13,323 --> 00:51:16,368
And once you're out, you're out.
There's no coming back.

734
00:51:16,493 --> 00:51:21,415
Mm, well, I would definitely like
to stay inside the circle.

735
00:51:21,498 --> 00:51:23,750
Well, then, tell me the truth.

736
00:51:30,174 --> 00:51:33,510
Jack, I don't know
what we're talking about.

737
00:51:33,635 --> 00:51:36,096
All right, now look, Focker,
I'm a patient man.

738
00:51:36,180 --> 00:51:39,641
That's what 19 months in a
Vietnamese prison camp will do to you.

739
00:51:39,725 --> 00:51:43,645
But I will be watching you,
studying your every move.

740
00:51:43,729 --> 00:51:48,108
And if I find that you are trying
to corrupt my firstborn child,

741
00:51:48,192 --> 00:51:50,110
I will bring you down, baby.

742
00:51:50,194 --> 00:51:52,738
I will bring you down
to Chinatown.

743
00:52:07,878 --> 00:52:10,422
Where are we? I thought
we were going to Kevin's house.

744
00:52:10,547 --> 00:52:15,677
We are, sweetie.
This is Kevin's new house.

745
00:52:15,802 --> 00:52:18,972
- Oh, this is a crazy house.
- Not bad, huh, Dad?

746
00:52:20,841 --> 00:52:24,853
Maybe he uses marijuana for medicinal purposes.
People do that nowadays.

747
00:52:24,937 --> 00:52:27,606
Honey, this kid has been lying to us
from the moment we met him.

748
00:52:27,731 --> 00:52:29,775
Hey, you. Get in some
quality time with the boys?

749
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:31,860
Uh-huh, yeah, it was fun.

750
00:52:32,885 --> 00:52:35,531
Listen, I hope this lunch
isn't too weird for you.

751
00:52:35,614 --> 00:52:39,576
Why would "B.B.Q
at Best Man's" be weird?

752
00:52:39,660 --> 00:52:42,830
Oh, my God, Greg.
I was sure I told you.

753
00:52:42,913 --> 00:52:45,707
Kevin is Bob's best man.
This is his place.

754
00:52:45,833 --> 00:52:49,878
- Kevin, your ex-fianc?
- Welcome, everybody.

755
00:52:50,003 --> 00:52:52,089
I don't understand.
How does he know Bob?

756
00:52:56,343 --> 00:52:59,805
Well, they-- they went
to lacrosse camp together,

757
00:52:59,930 --> 00:53:02,808
and Kevin was the one
who introduced Bob to Debbie.

758
00:53:02,933 --> 00:53:05,060
Lacrosse camp?

759
00:53:05,143 --> 00:53:08,105
I was really lucky
I was able to salvage this wood...

760
00:53:08,230 --> 00:53:10,274
from an old seamen's chapel
in Nantucket.

761
00:53:12,776 --> 00:53:14,903
Kevin, the house is amazing.
This is where

762
00:53:14,987 --> 00:53:16,905
Maybe you should have
gotten married here.

763
00:53:16,989 --> 00:53:20,033
All right, the sun is out,
the grill is hot and the pool is luke.

764
00:53:20,117 --> 00:53:23,579
If I can interest you
in a swim and a little B.B.Q, just follow me.

765
00:53:23,662 --> 00:53:25,747
All right, Kevo.
Right on schedule.

766
00:53:25,831 --> 00:53:27,384
- Bring it on.
- Wow. It must cost a fortune...

767
00:53:27,509 --> 00:53:30,752
Wait till you see
the rest of the house.

768
00:53:48,479 --> 00:53:50,689
-You okay, sweetie?
- Yeah.

769
00:53:50,814 --> 00:53:53,275
I'm really sorry.
I don't know why I thought you knew.

770
00:53:53,358 --> 00:53:55,277
It-- It's not
a big deal.

771
00:53:55,360 --> 00:53:57,946
If I can handle a weekend
without sex and cigarettes,

772
00:53:58,030 --> 00:54:01,617
I think I can handle an afternoon
with your ex-fiancée?

773
00:54:01,700 --> 00:54:03,285
Okay. Thank you.

774
00:54:03,368 --> 00:54:07,372
Now, for the floor that you're walking on,
I chose this Bolivian wormwood.

775
00:54:07,498 --> 00:54:12,336
I think it works well in here. I have the
Viking range here and the twin Sub-Z's.

776
00:54:12,461 --> 00:54:15,964
- Yeah, they open up right there.
- Oh, I get it. Like hidden.

777
00:54:16,089 --> 00:54:18,550
- Yeah, kind of blend in.
- Great.

778
00:54:18,675 --> 00:54:20,636
Are you a homeowner, Greg?

779
00:54:20,761 --> 00:54:24,264
No, no, I rent.

780
00:54:24,348 --> 00:54:28,143
So, things are going real, real well
for you, aren't they, eh, Kevo?

781
00:54:28,127 --> 00:54:29,863
Gosh, things have been going
so great lately.

782
00:54:29,888 --> 00:54:34,900
I got in early on some
wireless I.P.O.s, and the stuff
just skyrocketed from there.

783
00:54:36,525 --> 00:54:38,445
What about you, Greg?
What line of work are you in?

784
00:54:38,529 --> 00:54:41,156
- I'm in health care. - Yeah, so you know
what I'm talking about.

785
00:54:41,281 --> 00:54:44,034
There are a lot of Benjamins to be
made now with biotech stuff.

786
00:54:44,159 --> 00:54:46,662
I don't have to tell you that.
How's your portfolio?

787
00:54:47,687 --> 00:54:49,164
I'd say strong...

788
00:54:50,457 --> 00:54:52,918
to quite strong.

789
00:54:53,043 --> 00:54:55,128
You gotta strike
while the iron's hot.

790
00:54:55,212 --> 00:54:57,089
Now's the time.

791
00:54:57,214 --> 00:55:01,510
- Greg's a male nurse.
- That's right. Thank you, Jack.

792
00:55:01,635 --> 00:55:03,762
Well, that's great.

793
00:55:03,887 --> 00:55:08,016
That's great to give something
back like that. I'd love to
find time to do volunteer work.

794
00:55:08,141 --> 00:55:10,727
Just the other day I saw
this golden retriever that--

795
00:55:10,853 --> 00:55:12,855
He had like a gimp,
and he couldn't really--

796
00:55:12,980 --> 00:55:15,440
It made me feel terrible.
I wish there was something I could do.

797
00:55:15,566 --> 00:55:19,194
Yeah, well, I get paid, but also it feels,
you know, good too.

798
00:55:19,278 --> 00:55:21,530
So it's kind of
an everybody wins.

799
00:55:21,655 --> 00:55:24,283
What are you-- You're like
a Wall Street trader?

800
00:55:24,408 --> 00:55:27,703
- An investment guy?
- No. I mean, I'm willing
to be painted with that brush.

801
00:55:27,828 --> 00:55:29,788
Yes, that's my day job.

802
00:55:31,248 --> 00:55:33,333
We have time?
We got time, don't we, Jack?

803
00:55:33,417 --> 00:55:36,979
I want to show you what I'm really
interested in. Come on. Let's go.

804
00:55:40,966 --> 00:55:43,552
Wow! It looks like
somebody got an "A" in wood shop.

805
00:55:45,721 --> 00:55:49,558
Yeah, it's always been kind of a hobby.
I whittled that out of beech wood.

806
00:55:49,683 --> 00:55:51,685
It's beautiful.

807
00:55:51,768 --> 00:55:54,480
- So what got you into, uh, "carpentering"?
- Carpentry?

808
00:55:55,405 --> 00:55:57,274
I guess I'd have to say Jesus.

809
00:55:58,099 --> 00:56:01,904
He was a carpenter, and I
just figured if you're gonna
follow in someone's footsteps,

810
00:56:01,987 --> 00:56:03,822
who better than Christ?

811
00:56:08,452 --> 00:56:10,662
Greg's Jewish.

812
00:56:10,787 --> 00:56:12,664
- Are you?
- Yeah.

813
00:56:14,089 --> 00:56:15,334
Well, so was J.C.

814
00:56:15,559 --> 00:56:17,336
Wow.
You're in good company.

815
00:56:21,965 --> 00:56:23,926
Well, I'm gonna head
to the pool,

816
00:56:24,009 --> 00:56:27,396
but why don't you show Greg and Pam
the gift?

817
00:56:27,679 --> 00:56:29,640
- Wow, he made a gift.
-Greg.

818
00:56:29,765 --> 00:56:32,226
I put a fresh coat
of lacquer on this this morning,

819
00:56:32,251 --> 00:56:34,311
so bear with me
with the fumes.

820
00:56:39,608 --> 00:56:42,236
- Isn't that something?
- That's incredible.

821
00:56:42,319 --> 00:56:44,947
- Thank you.
- Roses. Deb's favorite.

822
00:56:45,072 --> 00:56:47,825
- Yes, right. - It's beautiful.
The little holes are for candles.

823
00:56:47,950 --> 00:56:50,285
Exactly. And then later,
they'll collect rainfall.

824
00:56:50,369 --> 00:56:53,872
- They make a tiny birdbath.
- That's great.

825
00:56:53,997 --> 00:56:57,125
It's beautiful.
What is it?

826
00:56:57,251 --> 00:56:59,253
It's an altar.

827
00:56:59,336 --> 00:57:01,839
Or you might call it a "ho-puh".

828
00:57:03,757 --> 00:57:06,343
Isn't that sweet?

829
00:57:06,468 --> 00:57:08,470
I'm gonna take it over
to the Byrneses',

830
00:57:08,595 --> 00:57:12,307
and tomorrow Robert and Debra
will meet beneath it to become man and wife.

831
00:57:12,391 --> 00:57:15,144
And later,
when they purchase a home,

832
00:57:15,269 --> 00:57:17,229
maybe it will
grace their garden.

833
00:57:17,354 --> 00:57:21,817
Well, that's my sappy,
romantic idea.

834
00:57:24,403 --> 00:57:26,363
Must have taken forever to build.

835
00:57:26,488 --> 00:57:29,158
No, not too bad.
About 70 hours.

836
00:57:29,241 --> 00:57:33,245
Which isn't bad, considering I carved it all
by hand from one piece of wood.

837
00:57:34,770 --> 00:57:36,081
Hey, Kevo.

838
00:57:36,206 --> 00:57:39,293
12:15. Time to start
the barbecue, big guy.

839
00:57:39,376 --> 00:57:42,488
Okay, Mr. B.
I better get back to playing host.

840
00:57:42,513 --> 00:57:46,216
Okay, you guys,
grab your suits, and I'll
meet you down at the pool.

841
00:57:46,341 --> 00:57:49,161
- I think I'm gonna take
a pass on the swimming.
- Oh, no, you can't.

842
00:57:49,187 --> 00:57:52,248
I don't even have a suit with me.
The airline lost my bag and--

843
00:57:52,273 --> 00:57:56,226
- Pamcake, let's go. Mom's got your suit here.
- Coming, Dad.

844
00:57:56,351 --> 00:57:58,228
You better get going.

845
00:57:59,813 --> 00:58:02,316
Gosh, she's great.
Congratulations, man.

846
00:58:02,441 --> 00:58:07,529
Thank you. And, by the way, she just
had the nicest things to say about you.

847
00:58:07,613 --> 00:58:10,449
- Really?
- Yeah.

848
00:58:12,409 --> 00:58:16,538
Gosh. Yeah, we had
some good times together.

849
00:58:16,663 --> 00:58:19,374
Boy, she is a tomcat.

850
00:58:24,755 --> 00:58:26,882
So, let me hook you up
with some trunks, Gregger.

851
00:58:26,965 --> 00:58:29,927
- I'm not gonna swim.
- No, come on. I'm not taking no for an answer.

852
00:58:30,010 --> 00:58:34,723
Cold buffet is on the left,
wine and champagne on the right.

853
00:58:34,806 --> 00:58:37,267
Comin' through here.

854
00:58:47,152 --> 00:58:48,348
Yeah, that'd be gre--

855
00:58:49,649 --> 00:58:51,949
Hey, there he is!
Get out here.

856
00:58:54,493 --> 00:58:57,412
G-Man, we got salmon, we got swordfish.
What's it gonna be?

857
00:58:57,496 --> 00:59:02,960
Ah-- How 'bout a little of both, K-Dog?
I'm pretty hungry.

858
00:59:03,043 --> 00:59:05,838
I think they call that
"the munchies."

859
00:59:07,840 --> 00:59:10,843
Let's go. Hit the ball, Kev!
Show 'em what you got!

860
00:59:21,895 --> 00:59:23,689
Come on, team.
He's got nothing.

861
00:59:23,814 --> 00:59:26,316
- Service.
- Come on, Greg.

862
00:59:30,002 --> 00:59:31,113
Nice serve, pal.

863
00:59:36,326 --> 00:59:38,954
Oh, Greg! Come on!

864
00:59:39,037 --> 00:59:42,124
- Whoo! Nice shot, Maverick!
- Sweet setup, Iceman.

865
00:59:42,207 --> 00:59:45,544
- Nice one, Nurse.
- Glenn, Glenn, Glenn.

866
00:59:45,669 --> 00:59:47,838
You gotta rush the net on defense.
Don't be afraid of the ball.

867
00:59:47,963 --> 00:59:50,674
- It's Greg.
- Huddle up, team.

868
00:59:50,799 --> 00:59:53,135
Greg, not Glenn.
Greg is afraid of the ball.

869
00:59:53,218 --> 00:59:56,138
- Come on. This is unacceptable.
- He's gotta go for the ball.

870
00:59:56,221 --> 01:00:00,100
- Here's what we gotta do.
- Let's go! We're gettin' cold in here.

871
01:00:00,184 --> 01:00:03,729
- We're gettin' creamed.
- If Florence Nightingale
over here would play defense.

872
01:00:03,854 --> 01:00:06,815
- Larry, I missed one shot.
- It was a big shot.

873
01:00:06,940 --> 01:00:09,151
Larry, keep floatin' where
you are. You're doin' great.

874
01:00:09,234 --> 01:00:12,070
Denny, take the deep shots.
Greg, nobody's expecting
much out of you.

875
01:00:12,196 --> 01:00:15,908
- If I set you up with the ball,
can you jump up and spike it? - No.

876
01:00:16,033 --> 01:00:17,910
Yeah. I'd have to be
pretty high, but yeah.

877
01:00:18,035 --> 01:00:20,412
I bet you would, Panama Red.

878
01:00:20,537 --> 01:00:22,998
- All right, everybody, look sharp. Break!
- Let's play some ball.

879
01:00:23,123 --> 01:00:25,834
All right, here we go.

880
01:00:27,628 --> 01:00:29,421
Let's go.
Come on.

881
01:00:29,546 --> 01:00:31,757
Greg!
Set!

882
01:00:33,425 --> 01:00:36,678
You gotta spike those, Focker!
You gotta spike those!

883
01:00:36,762 --> 01:00:39,431
- Look how Bob did that. Nice play, Bob.
- Thanks, Jack.

884
01:00:39,556 --> 01:00:42,726
Fire it up there, Focker!
Let's do it!

885
01:00:42,851 --> 01:00:45,437
- Way to go, Deb!
- Greg!

886
01:00:50,083 --> 01:00:51,527
Honey! God!

887
01:00:56,865 --> 01:00:59,535
- What the hell's the matter with you?
- It's only a game, Focker!

888
01:00:59,618 --> 01:01:02,037
Oh, honey! I'm coming!

889
01:01:02,120 --> 01:01:04,873
Get some ice.

890
01:01:04,957 --> 01:01:08,752
- My eye! Oh, my eye!
- Focker!

891
01:01:14,341 --> 01:01:16,885
Pam, help your sister, please.
I'm sorry, Deb.

892
01:01:17,010 --> 01:01:20,305
Deb, you can totally see Voit
backwards on your forehead.

893
01:01:20,430 --> 01:01:22,766
- Denny, get outta here!
- You the bandleader? - Yes, sir.

894
01:01:22,891 --> 01:01:25,477
Go over the song selection
with Bob. Bob? Bob!

895
01:01:25,602 --> 01:01:28,230
- Yeah, Jack.
- Are you a Mr. Focker?

896
01:01:28,313 --> 01:01:31,024
- Yes.
- Okay. Sign here, please.

897
01:01:42,286 --> 01:01:45,964
Hey, your suitcase.
You go through it, make sure it's all there?

898
01:01:46,047 --> 01:01:47,541
- Yeah, it's fine. - Good.
- What's up?

899
01:01:50,085 --> 01:01:53,714
I just wanna make sure you're okay
since hitting the spike heard 'round the world.

900
01:01:53,839 --> 01:01:56,717
- Oh, yeah. I'm really sorry about that.
- It's okay.

901
01:01:56,842 --> 01:01:59,595
I don't know
what got into me, Iceman.

902
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:03,857
- "Iceman"? - I'm sorry. Is that a
special thing between you and Kev...

903
01:02:03,940 --> 01:02:06,559
- Stop it.
- Stop what, Iceman?

904
01:02:06,685 --> 01:02:08,854
Top Gun was a very popular movie
when Kevin and I dated.

905
01:02:08,979 --> 01:02:12,858
- All right? That's it.
- Hey, Iceman.

906
01:02:13,741 --> 01:02:16,761
Do you want to be Maverick?
Is that what this is all about?

907
01:02:16,845 --> 01:02:19,364
- I can't be Maverick. Kevin's Maverick.
- He used to be,

908
01:02:19,448 --> 01:02:21,742
but we can change that.

909
01:02:21,867 --> 01:02:25,871
- Um, can he be Goose?
- No, because Goose dies in the end.

910
01:02:27,954 --> 01:02:29,290
Very sad.

911
01:02:30,501 --> 01:02:33,245
- Honey, I don't really--
- Greg, shut up.

912
01:02:46,767 --> 01:02:50,570
- Jesus, Dad, you ever think of knocking?
- Not in my own den.

913
01:02:50,695 --> 01:02:53,774
- What are you two doing in here?
- I'd say rounding in 2nd base.

914
01:02:56,318 --> 01:03:00,380
- This is Greg's room, Dad.
- Not anymore. We're gonna
use it for storage.

915
01:03:00,663 --> 01:03:03,308
Greg will stay
in Debbie's room, and she'll
bunk up with you tonight.

916
01:03:03,533 --> 01:03:04,952
Fine.
Come on, Greg.

917
01:03:05,035 --> 01:03:07,929
- Okay. I'll be right up.
- I'll meet you upstairs.

918
01:03:08,455 --> 01:03:11,792
Oh, good.
They found your suitcase.

919
01:03:12,375 --> 01:03:16,004
Hey, Jack, I don't quite know
what happened back at the tux shop,

920
01:03:16,129 --> 01:03:20,358
but if I've given you
the wrong impression regarding
Pam in any way, I'm sorry.

921
01:03:20,483 --> 01:03:24,805
Okay? I have nothing but the best
intentions with Pam, and I-I just--

922
01:03:24,888 --> 01:03:27,933
Actually, there's something
in the suitcase here that
I'm planning on giving her...

923
01:03:28,016 --> 01:03:30,310
that I think, um,
symbolizes...

924
01:03:32,646 --> 01:03:36,108
the level
of my commitment, uh, to her.

925
01:03:37,333 --> 01:03:39,611
And I wouldn't feel right
asking her to wear it...

926
01:03:39,695 --> 01:03:42,072
without her father's permission.

927
01:03:43,056 --> 01:03:44,158
Jack?

928
01:03:45,441 --> 01:03:46,285
Did you flush
this toilet?

929
01:03:48,036 --> 01:03:50,873
Maybe. You know what?
Maybe Jinx flushed it.

930
01:03:50,998 --> 01:03:53,000
I saw little Jinxy
come in last night,

931
01:03:53,125 --> 01:03:55,878
and he took a little squat
and relieved himself.

932
01:03:56,003 --> 01:04:00,273
Jinx knows not to use that toilet,
and even if he did, he'd never flush it.

933
01:04:00,498 --> 01:04:03,318
- What does it matter?
- The matter, Greg, R.N.,

934
01:04:03,343 --> 01:04:05,053
is that when this toilet
is flushed, it runs,

935
01:04:05,179 --> 01:04:09,549
and when you have a septic tank
that's nearly full and a toilet
that's been running all night,

936
01:04:09,574 --> 01:04:10,851
then you could have
a hell of a problem.

937
01:04:12,176 --> 01:04:13,145
Mr. Byrnes?

938
01:04:14,228 --> 01:04:15,856
This is not part
of my job description.

939
01:04:15,981 --> 01:04:18,775
Nice stench.
You're really on a roll there, bud.

940
01:04:19,158 --> 01:04:20,360
Bite me, Denny!

941
01:04:21,744 --> 01:04:25,498
In 20 hours, I'm having a wedding here,
so I need my cesspool pumped now!

942
01:04:25,523 --> 01:04:28,202
- Not tomorrow. Now!
- Dad, what's going on?

943
01:04:29,127 --> 01:04:32,238
- Oh, my God!
- What's that smell?

944
01:04:31,663 --> 01:04:33,832
That smell, Bob,
is our shit.

945
01:04:34,716 --> 01:04:37,635
Focker flushed the toilet in the den,
so the septic tank is overflowing.

946
01:04:37,719 --> 01:04:40,346
Jack, I told you.
It wasn't me. It was Jinx.

947
01:04:40,471 --> 01:04:42,765
Focker, I'm not gonna tell you again!

948
01:04:42,849 --> 01:04:45,810
Jinx cannot flush the toilet.
He's a cat, for Christ sakes!

949
01:04:45,893 --> 01:04:48,730
The animal doesn't
even have thumbs, Focker.

950
01:04:50,398 --> 01:04:53,026
- Hey, look at this!
- Kevo!

951
01:04:53,151 --> 01:04:55,194
Over by the tree, right?

952
01:04:58,489 --> 01:05:00,658
No. No, no, no.
Not on the lawn!

953
01:05:00,783 --> 01:05:04,203
Stay where you are.
Not on the lawn!

954
01:05:14,130 --> 01:05:16,215
What the heck?

955
01:05:17,884 --> 01:05:20,053
<i>I got my mojo workin'</i>

956
01:05:21,179 --> 01:05:23,181
<i>Just won't work on you</i>

957
01:05:25,808 --> 01:05:28,269
<i>I got my mojo workin'</i>

958
01:05:28,394 --> 01:05:31,189
<i>Just won't work on you</i>

959
01:05:33,024 --> 01:05:35,526
I know that's what I said I wanted,
'cause that's what I wanted.

960
01:05:35,552 --> 01:05:37,612
It is a black
Samsonite suitcase.

961
01:05:37,737 --> 01:05:41,115
What I'm saying is, do you
think it's possible that
the Samsonite people,

962
01:05:41,240 --> 01:05:45,203
in some crazy little scheme
to actually turn a profit,
made more than one?

963
01:05:45,286 --> 01:05:47,121
- I don't think so.
- You don't?

964
01:05:47,246 --> 01:05:50,708
- I am going to need your
baggage claim number again.
- Jinx, stop.

965
01:06:38,673 --> 01:06:42,302
- I know I signed for it.
- I'm looking at your signature
right here, Mr. Focker.

966
01:06:42,427 --> 01:06:45,596
- Do me a favor. Could I talk
to your supervisor? - Excuse me?

967
01:06:45,722 --> 01:06:48,266
- What's your name?
- Joy.

968
01:06:48,349 --> 01:06:52,103
- Okay, let me talk to your supervisor.
- My supervisor is on a break.

969
01:06:52,186 --> 01:06:54,272
When he gets back, have him give me
a call right away.

970
01:06:54,356 --> 01:06:56,774
- It's a very important bag.
- I'm sure it is--

971
01:07:04,824 --> 01:07:07,785
- Don't ask me what it's for.
I need you to do this thing.

972
01:07:07,910 --> 01:07:10,622
Please, I'm in a time situation here,
so just do it. I'll hold on.

973
01:07:10,747 --> 01:07:14,459
- So the name's "Greg Focker"?
- I don't know. Greg or Gregory.
Run both names.

974
01:07:16,085 --> 01:07:17,962
Jinx.

975
01:07:18,046 --> 01:07:21,049
Come on. No. Jinx.
Come here. Jinxy.

976
01:07:24,469 --> 01:07:26,846
Jinx. Oh, shit.

977
01:07:26,971 --> 01:07:31,309
Greg didn't ace his med
school boards. He never
even took the goddamn MCATs.

978
01:07:31,392 --> 01:07:35,396
Oh, Jack, that's what you
had your sources check out?

979
01:07:35,521 --> 01:07:38,066
What this poor boy did
on some test scores?

980
01:07:38,191 --> 01:07:40,818
I bet he doesn't even have
a real nursing degree.

981
01:07:40,944 --> 01:07:45,031
A lot of these hospital workers
are just pill poppers looking
for easy access to ludes.

982
01:07:45,156 --> 01:07:47,867
We already know that he's been
puffin' the magic dragon.

983
01:07:47,992 --> 01:07:50,244
I knew the little crack
was lying.

984
01:07:51,704 --> 01:07:55,500
Jinxy. Come here.
Come here, little Jinxy.

985
01:08:01,464 --> 01:08:05,176
Jinxy cat, Jinxy cat
I won't hurt you.

986
01:08:10,056 --> 01:08:12,016
The fact is,
Greg lied to you.

987
01:08:12,100 --> 01:08:15,979
- He did not lie to me, Dad.
- He lied to you when I thought
you should know the truth.

988
01:08:16,062 --> 01:08:18,398
I love you too much
to see you get hurt.

989
01:08:18,481 --> 01:08:23,444
I don't care what your information says, Dad.
Greg took the MCATs. Okay?

990
01:10:05,129 --> 01:10:07,590
No! Oh!
Oh, my God!

991
01:10:07,674 --> 01:10:09,717
All right, everybody.
All right, stand back.

992
01:10:09,801 --> 01:10:12,136
Stay back. Stay back.

993
01:10:14,263 --> 01:10:16,349
Oh, Jack! Oh, God!

994
01:10:19,185 --> 01:10:23,147
We've got a fire! Somebody call 911
right away! Hurry up!

995
01:10:28,278 --> 01:10:31,030
Jinxy! Jinxy!

996
01:10:31,155 --> 01:10:34,534
We checked every yard,
every car on the street.
Nobody's seen him.

997
01:10:34,617 --> 01:10:36,536
He's not up in any
of the trees, Jack.

998
01:10:36,661 --> 01:10:38,663
We checked all the bedrooms.
Jinx isn't up here.

999
01:10:38,788 --> 01:10:40,549
Yeah, none of the neighbors
have seen him either.

1000
01:10:40,674 --> 01:10:44,244
You tried to milk him, didn't you,
you sick son of a bitch!

1001
01:10:44,669 --> 01:10:46,671
Dad, stop it.
That's enough.

1002
01:10:46,754 --> 01:10:49,382
Honey, please calm down.
How can I calm down...

1003
01:10:49,507 --> 01:10:52,552
if we're 15 minutes away
from the wedding rehearsal
and the ring bearer's missing?

1004
01:10:52,677 --> 01:10:55,763
- Whoa. What do you mean, "the ring bearer"?
- Your daddy didn't tell you?

1005
01:10:55,888 --> 01:10:58,975
He taught Jinx to walk down the aisle
with this little pillow.

1006
01:10:59,058 --> 01:11:01,060
Oh, no.
No, you didn't, Dad.

1007
01:11:01,185 --> 01:11:04,564
Yeah, yeah. You put this around
the neck, and these ribbons are for the rings.

1008
01:11:04,647 --> 01:11:07,859
That's adorable, Jack.
Oh, for Chris sakes!

1009
01:11:07,942 --> 01:11:10,862
- That's great, Dad.
- Yeah, but now we have
to postpone the rehearsal.

1010
01:11:10,945 --> 01:11:13,698
Bob, you ride with me.
Larry, you come with your car.

1011
01:11:13,823 --> 01:11:16,034
We're gonna canvass the neighborhood.
Dee, ask O'Boyle to wait.

1012
01:11:16,159 --> 01:11:19,329
If we're not back in an hour, we'll
reschedule the rehearsal for the morning.

1013
01:11:19,412 --> 01:11:23,249
- Jack! - No! We cannot cancel the
rehearsal for some stupid cat!

1014
01:11:23,333 --> 01:11:27,545
Stupid cat? How could you say that?
That cat's been like a brother to you!

1015
01:11:27,629 --> 01:11:31,924
We're supposed to let him wander
the streets without food, water or toilet?

1016
01:11:33,593 --> 01:11:36,304
- D-Dad, Greg'll find him.
- What?

1017
01:11:36,429 --> 01:11:39,223
- Yeah, what?
- Oh, that's wonderful.

1018
01:11:41,309 --> 01:11:44,771
Fine. Fine. Okay.
Denny?

1019
01:11:44,896 --> 01:11:47,065
- Denny? Denny? Denny!
- Dad, I'm right here.

1020
01:11:47,190 --> 01:11:50,109
Okay. You're gonna fill in
as the ring bearer for now.

1021
01:11:50,234 --> 01:11:55,490
- No. I'm not wearin' that
stupid pillow thing on my head.
- Oh, yes, you damn well will!

1022
01:11:56,741 --> 01:12:01,663
Jinx! Jinx!
Here, Jinx.

1023
01:12:01,788 --> 01:12:07,418
You just go and wander the streets
without food, water or toilet? Fucker!

1024
01:12:09,504 --> 01:12:14,467
Actually, you may be in luck.
They brought in a Himalayan a little while ago.

1025
01:12:15,192 --> 01:12:16,636
There he is.

1026
01:12:18,054 --> 01:12:19,931
Holyshit, that's Jinx.

1027
01:12:20,056 --> 01:12:23,059
- Jinxy!
- Uh, no, let me see that photo again.

1028
01:12:23,184 --> 01:12:25,478
You gotta picture him without
that stupid Santa cap.

1029
01:12:25,603 --> 01:12:29,607
- Come on, Jinxy. Jinxy!
- Uh, no.

1030
01:12:29,691 --> 01:12:33,528
You see, in the picture,
your cat has an all-black tail.

1031
01:12:33,653 --> 01:12:36,614
And this one has a white tip.

1032
01:12:36,698 --> 01:12:39,117
No, I'm sorry
about that, chief.

1033
01:12:41,286 --> 01:12:43,538
- Looks just like him.
- Almost.

1034
01:12:44,664 --> 01:12:46,916
Except for that tail.

1035
01:12:57,944 --> 01:13:00,523
Dearly beloved--

1036
01:13:05,059 --> 01:13:08,062
we are gathered here
on this beautiful day...

1037
01:13:08,187 --> 01:13:10,356
to join Dr. Robert Banks--

1038
01:13:13,610 --> 01:13:18,615
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here
on this beautiful day...

1039
01:13:18,740 --> 01:13:23,369
to join Dr. Robert Banks
and Debra Byrnes in holy matrimony.

1040
01:13:23,494 --> 01:13:25,872
This is a special day--

1041
01:13:50,355 --> 01:13:52,440
He found him!
Yea!

1042
01:13:52,565 --> 01:13:55,401
It's him!
It's him!

1043
01:13:55,485 --> 01:13:58,237
I gotta see this.

1044
01:14:00,448 --> 01:14:03,701
- Look, Dad, it's Jinx.
- Oh, my little baby!

1045
01:14:03,785 --> 01:14:08,081
- We found you. We found you.
- Greg, thank you so much.

1046
01:14:08,206 --> 01:14:11,084
- Where did you find him?
- Gave us a little scare, huh?

1047
01:14:24,305 --> 01:14:29,560
<i>For once in my life
I got someone who needs me</i>

1048
01:14:29,686 --> 01:14:32,814
To Greg.
Hooray!

1049
01:14:32,939 --> 01:14:36,067
- Honey, where is Greg, anyway?
- He's in the restroom.

1050
01:14:36,192 --> 01:14:40,113
Yes, I tried there. I've tried every shelter
on the north shore, okay?

1051
01:14:40,196 --> 01:14:45,243
He's a brown-and-black Himalayan
with an all-black tail.

1052
01:14:45,368 --> 01:14:49,831
Mr. Jinx. Yeah, okay.
You go check. I'll call you back.

1053
01:14:51,617 --> 01:14:53,811
It's the man of the hour.

1054
01:14:55,295 --> 01:14:58,298
Sorry, folks. Had to pay a little visit
to the urinal fairy.

1055
01:15:03,678 --> 01:15:06,764
Greg, nice work
with the cat today.

1056
01:15:06,889 --> 01:15:09,042
Aw, thanks, Jack.
I'm just glad I could help out.

1057
01:15:09,267 --> 01:15:12,645
We never did get to finish
that little "convo" back at the den.

1058
01:15:12,770 --> 01:15:15,940
So, when you have a minute, there is
still something I'd like to talk to you about.

1059
01:15:16,065 --> 01:15:19,277
We'll get right to it as soon as
we get back. You have my word.

1060
01:15:19,402 --> 01:15:21,904
I'm gonna hold you to that.
Circle of trust.

1061
01:15:22,030 --> 01:15:25,074
Guess who's back in
the circle of trust.

1062
01:15:43,468 --> 01:15:47,972
<i>Pull the string
and I'll wink at you</i>

1063
01:15:48,097 --> 01:15:50,516
<i>I'm your puppet</i>

1064
01:15:54,604 --> 01:15:57,690
Oh, poor Kevin looks lonely.

1065
01:15:57,815 --> 01:16:01,152
Maybe I should ask him to dance.
What do you think?

1066
01:16:01,235 --> 01:16:05,281
Sure. I bet he could, uh, whittle a
private little dance floor for the two of you.

1067
01:16:05,365 --> 01:16:07,367
I'm serious.

1068
01:16:07,450 --> 01:16:10,161
I saw some beech wood outside.
He's very handy.

1069
01:16:10,244 --> 01:16:14,749
He's an extremely handy
and crafty craftsman.

1070
01:16:14,874 --> 01:16:16,834
I shouldn't paint him
with that brush, but--

1071
01:16:16,918 --> 01:16:21,756
Come on. Seriously. Seriously.
Part of you wishes you ended up with him.

1072
01:16:21,881 --> 01:16:23,800
Yes, he's very talented,

1073
01:16:25,009 --> 01:16:26,886
but it would've
never worked out.

1074
01:16:27,011 --> 01:16:28,846
Why not?

1075
01:16:28,972 --> 01:16:31,766
I was never in love with Kevin.

1076
01:16:36,062 --> 01:16:38,022
I'm in love with you.

1077
01:16:39,607 --> 01:16:41,567
- That's a good explanation.
- Think so?

1078
01:16:41,693 --> 01:16:43,569
Thought you'd like that.

1079
01:16:43,695 --> 01:16:45,780
- I do.
- I'm glad.

1080
01:16:47,615 --> 01:16:50,702
No, Jinx. Mr. Jinx.
I called you like half an hour ago.

1081
01:16:52,245 --> 01:16:57,083
Okay, I already--
I already described it. Airline.

1082
01:16:57,166 --> 01:16:59,168
Messages.

1083
01:16:59,252 --> 01:17:02,922
It's brown...

1084
01:17:04,757 --> 01:17:07,969
with a little bit
of black trim.

1085
01:17:08,094 --> 01:17:10,054
Yes.

1086
01:17:10,138 --> 01:17:12,140
<i>Please enter
your four-digit code.</i>

1087
01:17:14,726 --> 01:17:17,770
<i>Jack, hi.
It's Hank MacAtee from next door.</i>

1088
01:17:17,895 --> 01:17:21,232
<i>You'll never guess who wandered
over here this afternoon. Mr. Jinx.</i>

1089
01:17:21,316 --> 01:17:24,569
<i>Yeah, he's not wearing his collar,
but, uh, I'm sure it's Jinxy.</i>

1090
01:17:24,611 --> 01:17:27,530
<i>Thought you might be worried, so just
give me a jingle when you guys get home,</i>

1091
01:17:27,614 --> 01:17:29,741
<i>and I'll bring
the little rascal over.</i>

1092
01:17:29,866 --> 01:17:34,537
Okay, well, if you could just keep checking,
please, and I'll call you back later. Thanks.

1093
01:17:36,321 --> 01:17:37,165
Any luck?

1094
01:17:37,290 --> 01:17:39,500
No, they're still looking.

1095
01:17:39,626 --> 01:17:41,586
Hey, Jack,
this is a great party.

1096
01:17:41,669 --> 01:17:46,132
I guess sometimes these things sort
of come together in their own kooky sort of way.

1097
01:17:46,215 --> 01:17:49,177
Yeah, it's kind of like
the way you found Jinxy.

1098
01:17:49,302 --> 01:17:53,097
- You found him at that animal shelter, huh?
- Uh-huh. Yeah, right.

1099
01:17:53,181 --> 01:17:56,768
- Well, the important thing
is he's home now. - Yes.

1100
01:17:56,893 --> 01:17:59,562
Yeah. You know, there's something about
that ball of fur...

1101
01:17:59,646 --> 01:18:01,773
that just puts
a big smile on my face.

1102
01:18:01,898 --> 01:18:05,318
Yeah. You haven't seen any of
his latest tricks, have you?

1103
01:18:07,612 --> 01:18:09,530
Well, when we get back,
I'll show you.

1104
01:18:09,656 --> 01:18:12,992
We don't have to do it tonight.
He's had a long day. He's probably tired.

1105
01:18:13,117 --> 01:18:15,954
No, I think he'd like
to show you tonight.

1106
01:18:19,374 --> 01:18:21,834
Why don't you give me
the key and let me drive?

1107
01:18:21,918 --> 01:18:23,836
Hey, Larry. You know what?
Why don't I drive?

1108
01:18:28,007 --> 01:18:30,969
Be my guest, Focker.

1109
01:18:31,094 --> 01:18:34,973
- Hey, sweetie, what are you doing?
- Larry said I could drive.

1110
01:18:39,269 --> 01:18:42,313
- Let's go. Hurry, hurry.
- All right. Bye, guys.

1111
01:18:42,438 --> 01:18:44,232
- See you.
- Thanks for driving.

1112
01:18:47,944 --> 01:18:51,990
Drives a little better
than your Taurus, huh, Greg?

1113
01:18:52,115 --> 01:18:54,617
Come on. Get in the car, honey.
Let's go. Hurry up.

1114
01:18:57,853 --> 01:18:59,747
Whoa, Nellie!

1115
01:18:59,872 --> 01:19:02,667
Everybody comfortable
back there?

1116
01:19:04,711 --> 01:19:07,672
You're a real wild man
at that wheel there.

1117
01:19:10,049 --> 01:19:12,677
You got your seat belts on back there?
Get your seat belts on.

1118
01:19:17,849 --> 01:19:19,767
Oh, Jesus, Focker!

1119
01:19:22,729 --> 01:19:24,689
Focker, take it easy.

1120
01:19:24,772 --> 01:19:28,134
Benz drives like a dream, Larry.

1121
01:19:31,362 --> 01:19:33,364
Oh, there's Jack.

1122
01:19:35,491 --> 01:19:38,244
Hey, Jackie.

1123
01:19:43,623 --> 01:19:46,127
Wanna play, Pops?
Let's play.

1124
01:19:49,589 --> 01:19:51,549
Okay, now, Greg? Greg?

1125
01:20:00,183 --> 01:20:02,143
Is everything okay, honey?

1126
01:20:02,268 --> 01:20:05,229
Yeah, just trying
to make good time.

1127
01:20:05,355 --> 01:20:07,357
What the heck
is the matter with you?

1128
01:20:07,440 --> 01:20:09,442
All right. We're gonna be home.
We're gonna get home.

1129
01:20:16,866 --> 01:20:19,369
It's not the autobahn.
Come on, Greg!

1130
01:20:25,008 --> 01:20:28,419
- Maybe you should drive after all, honey.
- We're okay.

1131
01:20:34,717 --> 01:20:36,803
All right.

1132
01:20:42,433 --> 01:20:45,436
Oh, no.
No, please.

1133
01:20:47,855 --> 01:20:49,816
- Yes!
- Jack just turned.

1134
01:20:49,941 --> 01:20:53,319
You were supposed
to make that left at the light,

1135
01:20:53,403 --> 01:20:55,363
Focker.

1136
01:20:55,488 --> 01:20:57,490
I think I'm gonna be sick.

1137
01:20:57,615 --> 01:21:00,159
Where does he think he's going?

1138
01:21:00,285 --> 01:21:04,163
- Home, home, home.
- What a fun ride.

1139
01:21:04,247 --> 01:21:06,708
Who gave him the keys?

1140
01:21:06,833 --> 01:21:09,961
- Okay, we're out.
- Yeah, we've had enough excitement.

1141
01:21:10,086 --> 01:21:11,446
I wonder if he has a license.

1142
01:21:11,471 --> 01:21:13,916
Yeah, a license to kill.

1143
01:21:18,276 --> 01:21:19,804
Come on, everybody.

1144
01:21:19,887 --> 01:21:22,974
Hey, nice driving, Mario!

1145
01:21:23,099 --> 01:21:25,518
You're a lunatic!

1146
01:21:25,643 --> 01:21:27,645
Come on, Linda!

1147
01:21:42,535 --> 01:21:44,912
It was the cat!
Goddamn you!

1148
01:21:45,038 --> 01:21:47,048
Dad, Dad-- Dad! Dad!

1149
01:21:47,373 --> 01:21:49,000
Calm down!

1150
01:21:49,125 --> 01:21:52,712
- Where's the cat?
- Cat got out! Cat got out, Jack!

1151
01:21:59,594 --> 01:22:02,764
You spray-painted his tail...

1152
01:22:02,889 --> 01:22:05,350
to make him look like Jinxy,
didn't you, Focker?

1153
01:22:06,434 --> 01:22:08,269
Greg, what's he talking about?

1154
01:22:08,394 --> 01:22:12,357
Hank MacAtee called me a couple of
hours ago and told me he found Jinxy.

1155
01:22:12,440 --> 01:22:14,567
He took his collar
and put it on an impostor.

1156
01:22:14,692 --> 01:22:18,237
Then he spray-painted his tail,
and then he tried to beat us back here...

1157
01:22:18,363 --> 01:22:21,032
so that he could
get rid of the evidence.

1158
01:22:24,243 --> 01:22:27,080
Please tell me
that's not true, Greg.

1159
01:22:28,706 --> 01:22:31,542
It was just a temporary solution
until I could find the real Jinx.

1160
01:22:34,602 --> 01:22:37,173
How could you do
something like that?

1161
01:22:38,633 --> 01:22:41,094
- I'm sorry.
- What are you going to tell me next?

1162
01:22:41,219 --> 01:22:44,347
That you set Kevin's
altar on fire?

1163
01:22:46,015 --> 01:22:47,976
Oh, my God.

1164
01:22:50,270 --> 01:22:53,815
Well, it wasn't intentional.
I was chasing Jinx up onto the roof.

1165
01:22:53,940 --> 01:22:57,068
I had a smoke, and I think
I might have lit something that--

1166
01:22:58,987 --> 01:23:03,283
I don't know what happened. He put so
much goddamn lacquer on that thing.

1167
01:23:03,408 --> 01:23:05,493
It was an accident
waiting to happen.

1168
01:23:05,618 --> 01:23:08,621
This is very disappointing, Greg.

1169
01:23:12,217 --> 01:23:15,295
Get out of my house, Focker,
and take your friend with you.

1170
01:23:17,422 --> 01:23:19,424
So you lied to me
about everything, huh, Greg?

1171
01:23:19,549 --> 01:23:22,176
You lied about the cat,
about the fire, about the MCATs.

1172
01:23:22,302 --> 01:23:25,513
I didn't lie about the MCATs. Come on, Pam.
Don't you see what's happening here?

1173
01:23:25,638 --> 01:23:28,600
- Your dad has totally turned you against me.
- I didn't turn her against you.

1174
01:23:28,683 --> 01:23:30,643
You did that to yourself.

1175
01:23:32,645 --> 01:23:36,190
Jack, please. You didn't like me from
the second I walked in here.

1176
01:23:36,316 --> 01:23:39,152
I'm a very
accepting person, Focker.

1177
01:23:39,277 --> 01:23:41,279
All I ask for is honesty.

1178
01:23:41,404 --> 01:23:44,282
Oh, honesty?

1179
01:23:44,365 --> 01:23:46,909
You wanna talk about
truth and honesty, Jack?

1180
01:23:46,993 --> 01:23:48,995
Okay, let's talk
a little truth and honesty.

1181
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:53,875
Let's talk a little
"Operation Ko Samui," Jack.

1182
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:55,960
What's he talking about, Dad?

1183
01:23:56,085 --> 01:23:58,504
Yeah, that's weird, 'cause I thought there
weren't any secrets...

1184
01:23:58,588 --> 01:24:00,673
inside the circle of trust, Jack.

1185
01:24:00,798 --> 01:24:03,801
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- You don't? Huh?

1186
01:24:03,926 --> 01:24:06,220
What's the matter?
Cat got your tongue?

1187
01:24:06,346 --> 01:24:07,506
Hey, Pam, guess what.

1188
01:24:07,589 --> 01:24:12,093
Daddy's planning a little
covert operation in Thailand
for the day after the wedding.

1189
01:24:12,518 --> 01:24:14,896
You are?

1190
01:24:15,021 --> 01:24:16,981
Round and round we go, Jack. Hey.

1191
01:24:17,106 --> 01:24:19,025
I bet everybody would love
to hear about your rendezvous...

1192
01:24:19,150 --> 01:24:21,027
in the parking lot of the Oyster Bay
Drug and Sundry.

1193
01:24:21,152 --> 01:24:24,864
You know what I'm talking about.
Where the guy gave you
the passports and the documents.

1194
01:24:24,989 --> 01:24:27,825
Or how about
your little phone call in Thai?

1195
01:24:27,909 --> 01:24:30,244
- Jack can't talk Thai.
- Oh, no, Dina.

1196
01:24:30,370 --> 01:24:34,499
Jack can talk Thai.
Jack talk Thai very well.

1197
01:24:34,624 --> 01:24:37,669
I'm sorry, Pam,
but your dad is not retired.

1198
01:24:37,752 --> 01:24:40,922
He's still very much
in the C.I.A.

1199
01:24:42,006 --> 01:24:45,218
- Daddy. What--
- He's right.

1200
01:24:45,343 --> 01:24:49,180
He's right.
My cover's blown.

1201
01:24:49,963 --> 01:24:51,182
I-I-I am planning...

1202
01:24:51,349 --> 01:24:53,726
a secret operation
the day after the wedding.

1203
01:24:53,810 --> 01:24:58,147
- What?
- A surprise honeymoon for Deb and Bob.

1204
01:24:58,231 --> 01:25:01,234
You stupid son of a bitch!
You just blew it!

1205
01:25:01,317 --> 01:25:02,860
What?

1206
01:25:02,944 --> 01:25:05,780
Ko Samui is an island
off the coast of Thailand!

1207
01:25:05,905 --> 01:25:09,534
That guy I was meeting in the parking lot
is Thor Svenson, my travel agent.

1208
01:25:09,617 --> 01:25:11,870
He was giving me their visas.

1209
01:25:14,247 --> 01:25:17,583
Wow, Thailand. Thanks a lot, J.B.
That's something.

1210
01:25:17,709 --> 01:25:19,877
Don't mention it.
I just, um--

1211
01:25:19,961 --> 01:25:22,630
You know, if this nursing
thing doesn't work out, Focker,

1212
01:25:22,655 --> 01:25:25,466
I'd say you definitely
have a career in espionage.

1213
01:25:28,803 --> 01:25:30,847
Thanks, Greg.

1214
01:26:04,380 --> 01:26:07,675
Well, I guess I'm gonna go
to the airport now.

1215
01:26:12,147 --> 01:26:14,349
I guess you're gonna stay here.

1216
01:26:18,269 --> 01:26:20,021
Pam, I--

1217
01:26:51,895 --> 01:26:55,265
- Gaylord M. Focker?
- Gaylord? Gaylord?

1218
01:26:55,348 --> 01:26:57,351
Yeah, that's me.

1219
01:26:58,434 --> 01:27:00,979
- I thought your name was Greg.
- It is.

1220
01:27:01,062 --> 01:27:03,022
That's not what it says
on the form. I know.

1221
01:27:03,147 --> 01:27:05,858
It's my legal name. Nobody's called me
by it since I was in third grade.

1222
01:27:08,486 --> 01:27:10,154
Whatever.

1223
01:27:12,323 --> 01:27:15,243
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
So your name's Gay Focker?

1224
01:27:21,249 --> 01:27:23,710
- Denny.
- I'm sorry. It's just it's not...

1225
01:28:05,251 --> 01:28:08,046
You're in luck.
There is room.

1226
01:28:15,261 --> 01:28:17,805
And without a Saturday stay-over,
that fare difference will be...

1227
01:28:17,931 --> 01:28:22,060
$1,137.11.

1228
01:28:24,437 --> 01:28:27,899
- Would you want me to book you the seat?
- Okay. All right.

1229
01:28:29,108 --> 01:28:31,110
Did you want to check
any bags today?

1230
01:29:13,569 --> 01:29:16,197
We should be all right
with only one usher, don't you think?

1231
01:29:17,373 --> 01:29:19,784
I'm not so sure, Jack.

1232
01:29:25,999 --> 01:29:28,259
Thought you might like to see this.

1233
01:29:36,418 --> 01:29:39,804
- How did you get this?
- Oh, I have my sources too.

1234
01:29:43,867 --> 01:29:48,354
I called Gaylord,
a.k.a. Greg's parents in Detroit.

1235
01:29:48,479 --> 01:29:51,816
They saved his SAT scores too,
in case you're interested.

1236
01:29:51,899 --> 01:29:55,778
Oh, honey. It--
That doesn't matter if he
did well on some test.

1237
01:29:55,862 --> 01:29:57,947
What does that prove?
Look at this place!

1238
01:29:58,031 --> 01:30:00,783
He almost destroyed the wedding
because he lied!

1239
01:30:02,444 --> 01:30:04,396
I love you Daddy,

1240
01:30:04,880 --> 01:30:08,466
but you can be
a real jerk sometimes.

1241
01:30:11,085 --> 01:30:15,340
So what if he took the MCATs?
He's still not good enough for Pam.

1242
01:30:15,465 --> 01:30:17,800
Who is, Jack?

1243
01:30:17,884 --> 01:30:21,179
Nobody has ever been
good enough for your Pam.

1244
01:30:25,959 --> 01:30:31,397
I mean, do you realize that you
never even warmed up to Kevin
until she broke up with him?

1245
01:30:31,522 --> 01:30:35,151
Maybe it's time you think about
what Pam wants.

1246
01:30:49,708 --> 01:30:52,310
Greg, it's me.

1247
01:30:52,535 --> 01:30:54,154
I'm sure you're in
the air by now,

1248
01:30:54,237 --> 01:30:57,783
so I guess you'll just
get this when you get home.

1249
01:31:00,935 --> 01:31:02,971
Listen, I am so sorry.

1250
01:31:04,055 --> 01:31:06,140
I acted like a complete idiot,

1251
01:31:06,266 --> 01:31:08,893
and I hope that you
can forgive me.

1252
01:31:10,270 --> 01:31:14,357
I mean, I-I don't care about
the fire or the cat or--

1253
01:31:16,150 --> 01:31:20,863
I mean, I can't believe you
actually spray-painted a cat.

1254
01:31:20,947 --> 01:31:25,034
That's actually really gross,
but th-the point is that--

1255
01:31:26,661 --> 01:31:29,706
that I understand
why you did it, and--

1256
01:31:29,789 --> 01:31:30,991
and I love you.

1257
01:31:30,974 --> 01:31:35,586
I want you to know that I really--
I really, really love you, and, uh--

1258
01:31:38,798 --> 01:31:41,968
When you get this,
will you please call me?

1259
01:31:42,093 --> 01:31:44,470
Okay. Bye.

1260
01:31:50,268 --> 01:31:52,645
Marty, listen, I need
a commercial flight I.D. scan.

1261
01:31:52,729 --> 01:31:54,981
Interstate from New York
La Guardia to Chicago.

1262
01:31:55,106 --> 01:31:57,358
Four-hour sweeps,
backwards and forwards.

1263
01:31:57,483 --> 01:32:01,112
Last name: Foxtrot, Oscar,
Charlie, Kilo, Echo, Romeo.

1264
01:32:01,195 --> 01:32:03,698
First name: Golf,
Alpha, Yankee, Lima--

1265
01:32:03,823 --> 01:32:08,620
Gaylord Focker on Atlantic American
flight 27, departs 2:35.

1266
01:32:08,703 --> 01:32:11,080
- 2:35? - Affirmative.
Twenty-three minutes. Thanks.

1267
01:32:12,206 --> 01:32:14,834
Enjoy your flight.
Thanks.

1268
01:32:14,959 --> 01:32:16,919
Hello.

1269
01:32:19,005 --> 01:32:22,884
Oh, I'm sorry. We're only boarding
rows nine and above right now.
You'll have to wait.

1270
01:32:23,009 --> 01:32:25,845
Well, I'm in row eight.

1271
01:32:25,970 --> 01:32:28,014
Please step aside, sir.

1272
01:32:28,139 --> 01:32:30,183
It's just one row.
Don't you think it's okay if I--

1273
01:32:30,308 --> 01:32:32,894
We'll call your row
momentarily.

1274
01:32:34,270 --> 01:32:36,314
Step aside, sir.

1275
01:33:01,047 --> 01:33:04,242
Thank you for waiting. We'd like to
continue boarding the aircraft now.

1276
01:33:04,325 --> 01:33:07,345
We're now boarding all rows,
please. All remaining rows.

1277
01:33:14,894 --> 01:33:16,229
Mm, hello.

1278
01:33:19,381 --> 01:33:20,900
Enjoy your flight.

1279
01:33:36,916 --> 01:33:38,918
Excuse me.

1280
01:33:41,004 --> 01:33:43,548
Okay, where's the fire, huh?

1281
01:33:49,971 --> 01:33:52,724
- I'm sorry, sir. You're gonna have
to check that. - I got it.

1282
01:33:52,807 --> 01:33:55,076
- No, I'm sorry. That bag won't fit.
- No, I'm not-- Hey.

1283
01:33:55,102 --> 01:33:58,396
- I'm not checking my bag, okay?
- There's no need to raise your voice, sir.

1284
01:33:58,479 --> 01:34:01,566
I'm not raising my voice.
This would be raising my voice to you, okay?

1285
01:34:01,591 --> 01:34:06,779
I don't want to check my bag. By the way,
your airline, you suck at checking bags.

1286
01:34:06,804 --> 01:34:08,865
Because I already did that once,
and you lost it,

1287
01:34:08,948 --> 01:34:11,159
and then I had everything
screwed up very badly for me.

1288
01:34:11,284 --> 01:34:12,986
- Okay?
- I can assure you that your bag...

1289
01:34:13,011 --> 01:34:15,288
will be placed safely below deck
with the other luggage.

1290
01:34:15,413 --> 01:34:18,833
Oh, yeah? How do you know my bag
will be safe below with the other luggage?

1291
01:34:18,958 --> 01:34:21,618
Are you physically gonna
take my bag beneath the plane?

1292
01:34:21,644 --> 01:34:24,464
Are you gonna go with the guys
with the earmuffs and put it in there?

1293
01:34:24,589 --> 01:34:27,634
- No.
- No? Okay. Then shut your pie hole...

1294
01:34:27,759 --> 01:34:30,762
and listen to me
when I say that I am finished...

1295
01:34:30,887 --> 01:34:33,907
with the checking-of-the-bags
conversation!

1296
01:34:34,090 --> 01:34:38,102
Sir, we have a policy on this airline
that if a bag is this large, we--

1297
01:34:38,186 --> 01:34:40,813
Get your grubby little paws
off of my bag, okay?

1298
01:34:40,939 --> 01:34:44,150
It's not like I have a bomb in here.
It's not like I want to blow up the plane.

1299
01:34:44,275 --> 01:34:47,528
- Sir!
- I wanna stow my bag according
to your safety regulations.

1300
01:34:47,654 --> 01:34:49,781
- Sir, sir--
- If you would take a second...

1301
01:34:49,864 --> 01:34:51,951
and take the little sticks out of your head
and clean out your ears,

1302
01:34:52,034 --> 01:34:54,094
maybe you would see that
I'm a person who has feelings,

1303
01:34:54,119 --> 01:34:56,421
and all I have to do
is do what I wanna do!

1304
01:34:56,505 --> 01:35:00,166
All I wanna do is hold onto my bag
and not listen to you!

1305
01:35:00,291 --> 01:35:04,128
The only way that I would ever let go of
my bag would be if you came over here now...

1306
01:35:04,212 --> 01:35:06,464
and tried to pry it
from my dead, lifeless fingers.

1307
01:35:06,547 --> 01:35:10,510
Okay? If you can get it from my kung fu
grip, then you can have it.

1308
01:35:10,635 --> 01:35:13,137
Okay? Otherwise, step off, bitch.

1309
01:35:15,181 --> 01:35:18,017
Get off of me!
Get off of me!

1310
01:35:18,101 --> 01:35:20,561
- You got him?
- Yeah.

1311
01:35:27,527 --> 01:35:31,531
- Hey. Hey! You can't leave
your vehicle unattended. - Tow it.

1312
01:35:31,656 --> 01:35:34,275
I've got a plane full of people
saying you threatened that stewardess.

1313
01:35:34,300 --> 01:35:37,996
I was not threatening her.
I was trying to get my bag
into the overhead storage thing.

1314
01:35:38,079 --> 01:35:40,665
You were acting like a maniac,
and you threatened her with a bomb!

1315
01:35:40,790 --> 01:35:42,875
- I said I didn't have a bomb!
- You said "bomb."

1316
01:35:43,001 --> 01:35:45,878
- I said, "It's not like I have a bomb."
- You said "bomb" on an airplane.

1317
01:35:45,962 --> 01:35:49,257
- What's wrong with saying
"bomb" on an airplane?
- You can't say "bomb."

1318
01:35:49,382 --> 01:35:53,428
Bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb,
bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb!
You gonna arrest me?

1319
01:35:53,553 --> 01:35:56,514
- You assaulted an airline employee--
- What if I was a bombardier?

1320
01:35:56,598 --> 01:35:58,933
- I got enough to put you away
for a few years!
- Bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb!

1321
01:35:59,692 --> 01:36:03,062
Norm. Take five.
We got a specialist here.

1322
01:36:04,606 --> 01:36:06,816
Bye, Norm.

1323
01:36:11,571 --> 01:36:14,907
Oh, shit.
How'd you get here?

1324
01:36:15,033 --> 01:36:17,118
I'm everywhere, Focker.

1325
01:36:17,243 --> 01:36:19,120
I didn't do anything, Jack.

1326
01:36:19,245 --> 01:36:23,207
- Yeah, I know.
- Well, then tell these guys
that I'm not a terrorist.

1327
01:36:23,333 --> 01:36:27,086
Listen, Focker. I'm not gonna tell anybody
anything until you answer some questions.

1328
01:36:27,211 --> 01:36:29,789
Unless you want to spend the next
couple of years of your life in prison,

1329
01:36:29,814 --> 01:36:32,216
you better goddamn well
tell me the truth. No more lies.

1330
01:36:32,300 --> 01:36:34,886
You understand?
No more lies.

1331
01:36:35,011 --> 01:36:37,096
- Did you do this?
- Just answer the questions.

1332
01:36:37,221 --> 01:36:38,982
- Did you have me taken off of that airplane?
- Just answer the question.

1333
01:36:39,066 --> 01:36:41,393
Put your hands
over there. That's it.

1334
01:36:41,776 --> 01:36:43,937
You're sick, you know that?

1335
01:36:47,282 --> 01:36:50,326
Is your name Gaylord Focker?
Yes or no?

1336
01:36:50,410 --> 01:36:53,496
- Yes.
- Are you a male nurse?

1337
01:36:53,580 --> 01:36:55,623
- Yes.
- Are you a pothead?

1338
01:36:55,749 --> 01:36:57,709
- No.
- Have you ever smoked pot?

1339
01:36:57,792 --> 01:36:58,911
Yes.

1340
01:36:59,594 --> 01:37:02,756
Did you spray-paint the tail
of a cat to pass him off as Mr. Jinx?

1341
01:37:02,839 --> 01:37:04,149
Yes.

1342
01:37:04,232 --> 01:37:06,676
Did you do that because you desperately
were seeking my approval?

1343
01:37:06,760 --> 01:37:09,721
- Yes.
- Because you love my daughter Pam?

1344
01:37:09,804 --> 01:37:12,557
- Yes.
- Do you wanna marry her?

1345
01:37:14,642 --> 01:37:16,603
Do you want to marry her?

1346
01:37:19,022 --> 01:37:22,734
I did, until I met you.

1347
01:37:23,217 --> 01:37:24,986
What does that mean?

1348
01:37:25,111 --> 01:37:29,449
I love your daughter, Jack.
I love her more than anything.

1349
01:37:29,574 --> 01:37:33,119
But frankly, sir, I'm a little terrified
of being your son-in-law.

1350
01:37:33,244 --> 01:37:36,197
This whole weekend
has given me a lot of doubts...

1351
01:37:36,222 --> 01:37:38,792
about whether or not
I could even survive in your family.

1352
01:37:42,921 --> 01:37:45,840
I think you've got
some serious issues.

1353
01:37:47,142 --> 01:37:50,512
If I lighten up, would you
consider marrying my daughter?

1354
01:37:50,637 --> 01:37:52,597
Would you lighten up a lot?

1355
01:37:53,765 --> 01:37:56,017
- Yeah.
- Yes or no?

1356
01:37:56,142 --> 01:37:58,269
- Yes.
- Would you let me and Pam...

1357
01:37:58,270 --> 01:38:00,370
live our lives and not
interfere all the time?

1358
01:38:00,447 --> 01:38:03,024
I promise not interfere
in your lives all the time.

1359
01:38:03,149 --> 01:38:05,485
Will you stop making fun of me
for being a nurse?

1360
01:38:05,610 --> 01:38:09,280
Could you at least try, maybe,
to consider another profession?

1361
01:38:09,364 --> 01:38:11,116
- Jack, yes or no?
- Ever?

1362
01:38:11,241 --> 01:38:13,785
- No!
- Okay, yes.

1363
01:38:13,910 --> 01:38:15,870
Would you let me and Pam
sleep in the same room?

1364
01:38:15,995 --> 01:38:18,123
Don't push it, Focker.

1365
01:38:18,248 --> 01:38:20,959
You're in a real mess.

1366
01:38:22,419 --> 01:38:24,379
If you married my daughter,
would you support her...

1367
01:38:24,504 --> 01:38:26,548
in the way that she
deserves to be supported?

1368
01:38:26,673 --> 01:38:30,468
- Yes.
- Would you be honest and faithful to her?

1369
01:38:30,593 --> 01:38:32,345
Yes.

1370
01:38:32,470 --> 01:38:36,850
Will you devote yourself entirely to her
for the rest of your life?

1371
01:38:36,975 --> 01:38:39,060
Of course.

1372
01:38:40,353 --> 01:38:43,314
Gaylord Focker,

1373
01:38:44,098 --> 01:38:46,067
will you be my son-in-law?

1374
01:39:07,672 --> 01:39:09,841
Greg?

1375
01:39:09,924 --> 01:39:11,885
I thought you were
going back to Chicago?

1376
01:39:12,010 --> 01:39:15,305
Yeah, well, we had
a little plane trouble.

1377
01:39:15,388 --> 01:39:17,432
Plus, your dad
caught up with me at the airport.

1378
01:39:18,357 --> 01:39:19,434
No. Don't worry.

1379
01:39:19,559 --> 01:39:22,520
It's okay. We worked out
a lot of our issues.

1380
01:39:22,645 --> 01:39:25,732
You and my dad worked out
a lot of your issues?

1381
01:39:25,857 --> 01:39:29,694
Yeah. First he gave me his little human
lie detector thing, but I passed.

1382
01:39:30,778 --> 01:39:31,738
Good.

1383
01:39:32,021 --> 01:39:34,282
Yeah, and...

1384
01:39:35,575 --> 01:39:37,619
then he proposed.

1385
01:39:40,997 --> 01:39:43,208
Are you feeling all right?

1386
01:39:44,751 --> 01:39:48,046
Listen. This weekend was a nightmare.

1387
01:39:49,339 --> 01:39:51,883
I had this whole
elaborate plan, and then...

1388
01:39:51,966 --> 01:39:54,677
somewhere between
giving your sister a black eye...

1389
01:39:54,761 --> 01:39:58,890
and setting the house on fire,
it kind of went off track.

1390
01:40:01,476 --> 01:40:04,062
I just-- I love you.
I love you so much.

1391
01:40:07,899 --> 01:40:09,776
I think he's about to do it, Jack.

1392
01:40:09,901 --> 01:40:13,113
Come on, honey.
Give 'em some privacy.

1393
01:40:15,031 --> 01:40:18,159
...and I think
if we can get through...

1394
01:40:18,284 --> 01:40:21,788
what we got through in the last 48 hours,
we could get through anything.

1395
01:40:22,913 --> 01:40:24,582
I think so too.

1396
01:40:24,707 --> 01:40:27,419
- And, Greg, I don't--
- Wait. Hang on a second.

1397
01:40:27,544 --> 01:40:30,171
Mr. Jinx?

1398
01:40:38,853 --> 01:40:40,432
That's a ring.

1399
01:40:41,725 --> 01:40:45,770
I like to think of it
as a little circle of trust.

1400
01:40:47,814 --> 01:40:50,692
Pam?

1401
01:40:50,817 --> 01:40:53,361
- Will you marry me?
- Yes.

1402
01:40:54,654 --> 01:40:56,698
Yes.

1403
01:40:57,949 --> 01:41:01,202
Yes.

1404
01:41:02,662 --> 01:41:05,957
Attaboy, Greg!

1405
01:41:06,040 --> 01:41:09,043
That "circle of trust" thing?
That's mine.

1406
01:41:12,088 --> 01:41:15,633
Well, looks like we got
another wedding to plan.

1407
01:41:15,759 --> 01:41:18,553
- Yep. Just gotta do one more thing.
- What's that?

1408
01:41:18,678 --> 01:41:21,347
Meet his parents.

1409
01:41:21,473 --> 01:41:25,560
- Jack--
- Honey, relax. I'm sure they're wonderful,

1410
01:41:27,103 --> 01:41:29,272
Good night, Jack.

1411
01:41:36,529 --> 01:41:39,824
I mean, they'd have to be, right,
to name their son Gaylord Focker.

1412
01:41:43,036 --> 01:41:45,663
Do you, Debra Byrnes,
take Robert Banks...

1413
01:41:45,747 --> 01:41:47,707
to be your lawfully
wedded husband?

1414
01:41:47,832 --> 01:41:50,210
Yes. I mean, I do.

1415
01:41:50,335 --> 01:41:52,295
I now pronounce you
man and wife.

1416
01:42:09,479 --> 01:42:12,524
Let's just see if you really can
flush the toilet, Jinxy.

1417
01:42:38,255 --> 01:42:39,717
I knew it.

1418
01:42:39,801 --> 01:42:41,995
Shit!

1419
01:42:42,720 --> 01:42:45,390
- I knew it.
- Damn it!

1420
01:42:53,397 --> 01:42:56,401
That's my future son-in-law.
What do you think?

1421
01:42:56,526 --> 01:42:58,611
Hello, Jack.

1422
01:42:58,737 --> 01:43:01,656
Oh, look at that.
Nice Jack. Hi.

1423
01:43:01,781 --> 01:43:04,576
What's that, Jack?
What?

1424
01:43:04,701 --> 01:43:06,661
You're a big, bad C.I.A. man, huh?

1425
01:43:06,786 --> 01:43:09,664
Did they teach you that in the C.I.A.?
They teach you that?

1426
01:43:09,989 --> 01:43:11,916
Oh, yeah.
What's that, Jack?

1427
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:16,963
What? Yeah, you thought Puff was just
the name of the boy's magical dragon?

1428
01:43:17,088 --> 01:43:19,090
Not too quick
on the uptake, huh, Jack?

1429
01:43:19,174 --> 01:43:22,802
Why don't you ask Denny who's puffin'
the magic dragon? Not onto that one, huh?

1430
01:43:22,927 --> 01:43:25,930
Surprising for a big
C.I.A. pulse detector.

1431
01:43:26,055 --> 01:43:29,225
Ooh. Hey, hey, check my pulse
on this question, Jack.

1432
01:43:29,309 --> 01:43:31,478
Do I think you're a psycho?
