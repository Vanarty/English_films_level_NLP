1
00:01:11,418 --> 00:01:14,887
Freud said, "love and work.
Work and love.

2
00:01:14,888 --> 00:01:16,522
That's all there is."

3
00:01:16,523 --> 00:01:19,492
Well, I'm retired,
and my wife is dead.

4
00:01:19,493 --> 00:01:23,664
As you can imagine, that's
given me some time on my hands.

5
00:01:23,665 --> 00:01:25,799
My wife's been gone
for three and a half years.

6
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:28,000
I miss her in every way.
And retirement?

7
00:01:28,001 --> 00:01:31,104
That is an ongoing,
relentless effort in creativity.

8
00:01:31,105 --> 00:01:33,873
At first, I admit
I enjoyed the novelty of it.

9
00:01:33,874 --> 00:01:35,508
Sort of felt like
I was playing hooky.

10
00:01:35,509 --> 00:01:39,212
I used all the miles I'd saved
and traveled the globe.

11
00:01:39,213 --> 00:01:41,647
The problem was, no matter where
I went, as soon as I got home,

12
00:01:41,648 --> 00:01:44,383
The nowhere-To-Be thing
hit me like a ton of bricks.

13
00:01:44,384 --> 00:01:47,554
I realized the key to this whole
deal was to keep moving.

14
00:01:47,555 --> 00:01:50,524
Get up, get out of the house,
and go somewhere.

15
00:01:50,525 --> 00:01:52,491
Anywhere.

16
00:01:52,492 --> 00:01:55,896
Come rain or shine,
I'm at my Starbucks by 7:15.

17
00:01:56,863 --> 00:01:58,798
Excuse me, mind if we join you?

18
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,399
- No.
- Hey. How are you?

19
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:04,037
Can't explain it, but it makes
me feel part of something.

20
00:02:04,038 --> 00:02:05,905
These guys today,
they're not numbers guys.

21
00:02:05,906 --> 00:02:07,172
Don't talk figures with them.

22
00:02:07,173 --> 00:02:08,541
How do I spend
the rest of my days?

23
00:02:08,542 --> 00:02:12,513
You name it.
Golf, books, movies, pinochle.

24
00:02:12,514 --> 00:02:13,946
Tried yoga, learned to cook,

25
00:02:13,947 --> 00:02:16,283
Bought some plants,
took classes in mandarin.

26
00:02:16,284 --> 00:02:19,051
Xiang xin wo,
wo shen me dou shiguo le.

27
00:02:19,052 --> 00:02:21,655
Translation..."Believe me,
I've tried everything."

28
00:02:21,656 --> 00:02:26,126
And then, of course,
there are the funerals.

29
00:02:28,928 --> 00:02:31,663
So many more
than I could imagine.

30
00:02:31,664 --> 00:02:34,399
The only traveling I do
these days

31
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,038
Is out to San Diego
to visit my son and his family.

32
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:40,572
They're great.
I love them to pieces.

33
00:02:40,573 --> 00:02:42,909
But to be honest, I think
I probably relied on them

34
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:44,643
Way more than I should.

35
00:02:44,644 --> 00:02:47,480
Don't get me wrong,
I'm not an unhappy person.

36
00:02:47,481 --> 00:02:48,981
Quite the contrary.

37
00:02:48,982 --> 00:02:53,854
I just know there's a hole in
my life, and I need to fill it.

38
00:02:53,855 --> 00:02:55,821
Soon.

39
00:02:57,657 --> 00:03:00,593
Which brings me to today
when I was leaving the market

40
00:03:00,594 --> 00:03:03,530
And caught your flyer
out of the corner of my eye.

41
00:03:03,531 --> 00:03:05,132
Hmm.

42
00:03:07,534 --> 00:03:09,035
"Seniors, be an intern."

43
00:03:09,036 --> 00:03:11,171
Ben, I thought that was you.

44
00:03:11,172 --> 00:03:12,038
Hi.

45
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:12,904
Hey.

46
00:03:12,905 --> 00:03:14,540
What'd you find?

47
00:03:14,541 --> 00:03:17,410
I think an internet place
is looking for senior interns.

48
00:03:17,411 --> 00:03:19,996
- Am I reading this right?
- Let me see.

49
00:03:19,997 --> 00:03:22,581
"Applicants must be
over 65 years of age...

50
00:03:22,582 --> 00:03:26,085
have organizational skills, a
genuine interest in e-Commerce,"

51
00:03:26,086 --> 00:03:27,353
Whatever that is...

52
00:03:27,354 --> 00:03:29,354
"...and a roll-Up-Your-Sleeves
attitude."

53
00:03:29,355 --> 00:03:32,426
About the fit. Com, isn't that
the outfit that was...

54
00:03:32,427 --> 00:03:33,592
yeah, yeah, yeah.

55
00:03:33,593 --> 00:03:36,011
They bought one of those
old factories in red hook.

56
00:03:36,012 --> 00:03:38,431
My daughter says they
sell clothes on the internet.

57
00:03:38,432 --> 00:03:40,566
How that works, I have no idea.

58
00:03:40,567 --> 00:03:42,885
Well, you have to
upload the application.

59
00:03:42,886 --> 00:03:45,205
That could be challenging.
Listen to this...

60
00:03:45,206 --> 00:03:47,339
"Cover letters
are so old-Fashioned.

61
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:50,276
Show us who you are
with a cover-Letter video.

62
00:03:50,277 --> 00:03:53,213
Upload your video
to youtube or vimeo using

63
00:03:53,214 --> 00:03:57,149
. Mov, . Avi,
or a. Mpg file.

64
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:58,884
We look forward to
meeting you."

65
00:03:58,885 --> 00:04:00,619
Well, I guess that's meeting me.

66
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:03,956
I swear I don't even know
what language that was.

67
00:04:03,957 --> 00:04:06,126
What are you doing tonight, Ben?

68
00:04:06,127 --> 00:04:08,327
- A frozen lasagna?
- Well...

69
00:04:08,328 --> 00:04:11,464
I could make a little salad,
turn it into a dinner for two,

70
00:04:11,465 --> 00:04:14,033
Like we did that time
and never did again.

71
00:04:14,034 --> 00:04:16,602
You know that was
over five months ago?

72
00:04:16,603 --> 00:04:19,272
Oh, yeah. No, no, we got to
do that again, for sure,

73
00:04:19,273 --> 00:04:21,124
But okay
if we take a rain check?

74
00:04:21,125 --> 00:04:22,975
You're awful cute,
you know that?

75
00:04:22,976 --> 00:04:25,011
- No, I didn't.
- Well, it's true, you are.

76
00:04:25,012 --> 00:04:26,680
So I'll see you.

77
00:04:29,349 --> 00:04:30,983
Don't take too long, doll.

78
00:04:30,984 --> 00:04:33,018
You're not getting any younger.

79
00:04:33,019 --> 00:04:36,022
- I know, I know, I know.
- All right.

80
00:04:57,177 --> 00:05:00,614
So here I am, applying to be
one of your interns

81
00:05:00,615 --> 00:05:02,415
Because the more
I think about this idea,

82
00:05:02,416 --> 00:05:04,416
The more tremendous
I think it is.

83
00:05:04,417 --> 00:05:07,120
I love the idea of having
a place I can go every day.

84
00:05:07,121 --> 00:05:09,155
I want the connection,
the excitement.

85
00:05:09,156 --> 00:05:10,456
I want to be challenged,

86
00:05:10,457 --> 00:05:12,859
And I guess I might even
want to be needed.

87
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:15,262
The tech stuff might
take a bit to figure out.

88
00:05:15,263 --> 00:05:16,995
I had to call
my 9-Year-Old grandson

89
00:05:16,996 --> 00:05:19,533
Just to find out
what a usb connector was.

90
00:05:19,534 --> 00:05:21,466
But I'll get there.
Eager to learn.

91
00:05:21,467 --> 00:05:24,737
Also, I want you to know I've
been a company man all my life.

92
00:05:24,738 --> 00:05:27,840
I'm loyal, I'm trustworthy,
and I'm good in a crisis.

93
00:05:27,841 --> 00:05:29,692
And I love that
you're right here in Brooklyn.

94
00:05:29,693 --> 00:05:31,535
I've lived here all my life,
and lately I feel

95
00:05:31,536 --> 00:05:33,379
I may not be hip enough
to live in Brooklyn,

96
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:35,631
So this could help with that,
too.

97
00:05:35,632 --> 00:05:37,883
I read once,
musicians don't retire.

98
00:05:37,884 --> 00:05:40,119
They stop when
there's no more music in them.

99
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:44,457
Well, I still have music in me,
absolutely positive about that.

Good news,
I found a size eight in navy.

118
00:06:16,322 --> 00:06:19,259
No, you are right. That package
should have arrived by now.

119
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:20,626
Let me track that for you.

120
00:06:20,627 --> 00:06:22,795
Yep, these pants are awesome
if you have hips.

121
00:06:22,796 --> 00:06:24,096
Super slimming.

122
00:06:24,097 --> 00:06:26,032
Okay, let me just
review this with you...

123
00:06:26,033 --> 00:06:27,967
You have six bridesmaids.
You ordered six

124
00:06:27,968 --> 00:06:30,136
Of the silk chiffon
Antoinette dresses in pink.

125
00:06:30,137 --> 00:06:31,703
The wedding is in three days,

126
00:06:31,704 --> 00:06:35,573
And the dresses just arrived
all in charcoal gray.

127
00:06:35,574 --> 00:06:39,345
Which we don't even sell,
so that is a bit of a mystery.

128
00:06:39,346 --> 00:06:41,079
Okay, here's what
we're gonna do about this.

129
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,482
I am gonna call the vendor
and have this fixed today.

130
00:06:43,483 --> 00:06:45,952
I will personally see the
dresses before they are fedexed.

131
00:06:45,953 --> 00:06:48,121
And I promise you
they will be at your front door

132
00:06:48,122 --> 00:06:50,055
By 9:00 a.m. Friday,
okay?

133
00:06:50,056 --> 00:06:51,891
You know what, let me give you
my cell, just in case...

134
00:06:51,892 --> 00:06:54,826
718-555-0199.

135
00:06:54,827 --> 00:06:56,861
Oh, thank you so much
for your patience.

136
00:06:56,862 --> 00:06:59,232
And I am gonna refund you back
all your money.

137
00:06:59,233 --> 00:07:01,134
It's the...

138
00:07:01,135 --> 00:07:03,035
Yes. N...

139
00:07:03,036 --> 00:07:06,239
Okay, hey, you check this one
off your list, okay?

140
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,472
This is done.

141
00:07:07,473 --> 00:07:10,108
And, Rachel,
have a great wedding.

142
00:07:10,109 --> 00:07:12,745
Oh, my god, how did that happen?

143
00:07:12,746 --> 00:07:13,813
Jules?

144
00:07:13,814 --> 00:07:15,281
I know, I know,
I'm late for something.

145
00:07:15,282 --> 00:07:16,582
Yeah, everything.

146
00:07:16,583 --> 00:07:18,134
You see why I take
customer-Service calls?

147
00:07:18,135 --> 00:07:19,686
I mean, it's so good.
You learn so much.

148
00:07:19,687 --> 00:07:21,453
Okay, what's up?
What am I doing?

149
00:07:21,454 --> 00:07:23,322
Okay, Cameron was waiting for
you but had another meeting.

150
00:07:23,323 --> 00:07:25,090
He said
he'll be back at 2:00.

151
00:07:25,091 --> 00:07:27,692
- Everyone needs you to sign off on tomorrow's homepage.
- Right.

152
00:07:27,693 --> 00:07:29,563
And your 11:00 is in
the big conference room.

153
00:07:29,564 --> 00:07:31,830
So is your 11:10.
Finance needs you,

154
00:07:31,831 --> 00:07:33,432
And I guess you
e-Mailed a bunch of people

155
00:07:33,433 --> 00:07:34,917
At 4:00 a.m.
About something?

156
00:07:34,918 --> 00:07:36,402
Oh, good, I forgot about that.

157
00:07:36,403 --> 00:07:38,371
I want to figure out a way for
friends to shop together online.

158
00:07:38,372 --> 00:07:40,306
Make it less of an alone thing.

159
00:07:40,307 --> 00:07:42,241
- E-Mail me that idea, will you?
- Yeah, I like that.

160
00:07:42,242 --> 00:07:43,976
Um, is now a good time
to call your mom back?

161
00:07:43,977 --> 00:07:45,111
Dude, I'm on a bike.

162
00:07:45,112 --> 00:07:47,447
Happy birthday!

163
00:07:47,448 --> 00:07:48,848
Come on.

164
00:07:48,849 --> 00:07:51,450
Oh.

165
00:07:51,451 --> 00:07:54,121
Oh, what a mess. This is
the middle of the office.

166
00:07:54,122 --> 00:07:55,755
Don't... Don't...
Don't put that...

00:08:05,232 --> 00:08:06,598
I'm Ben Whittaker.

172
00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:08,335
I received an e-mail
about an interview

173
00:08:08,336 --> 00:08:10,070
For the senior intern program.

174
00:08:10,071 --> 00:08:11,336
Hey, Ben.
How's it going?

175
00:08:11,337 --> 00:08:12,955
It's going good, real good.
Thank you.

176
00:08:12,956 --> 00:08:14,573
Excellent.
Take a seat around the corner,

177
00:08:14,574 --> 00:08:16,742
And someone from talent
acquisition will come get you.

178
00:08:16,743 --> 00:08:18,977
Thank you.

179
00:08:18,978 --> 00:08:20,579
"Talent acquisition"?

180
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:22,314
♪ I'm all about that bass?

181
00:08:22,315 --> 00:08:24,049
♪ 'Bout that bass, no treble?

182
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:29,055
♪ I'm all about that bass,
'bout that bass?

183
00:08:31,091 --> 00:08:32,424
Okay, you guys have to remember,

184
00:08:32,425 --> 00:08:33,992
The homepage
has to read in a glance.

185
00:08:33,993 --> 00:08:35,861
- Right.
- Also, you have to get back like this

186
00:08:35,862 --> 00:08:38,431
If you want to see what looks
like if you're, like, over 35.

187
00:08:38,432 --> 00:08:40,866
Okay, so I can't read anything,

188
00:08:40,867 --> 00:08:43,252
But if I could,
what do you want me to see?

189
00:08:43,253 --> 00:08:45,396
"Five girls, one shirt"
or "check out the fit"?

190
00:08:45,397 --> 00:08:47,519
Well, both, but
what I really want you to see

191
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,642
Is the shirt worn by
five different body types.

192
00:08:49,643 --> 00:08:51,511
Okay, then
you got to make me see that.

193
00:08:51,512 --> 00:08:53,712
Try making the photo grid
bigger.

194
00:08:53,713 --> 00:08:56,015
I love that five.
Can we make it more graphic?

195
00:08:56,016 --> 00:08:57,283
Yeah, that's cool.

196
00:08:57,284 --> 00:08:59,352
Maybe hero
the girl in the red shirt.

197
00:08:59,353 --> 00:09:00,853
- Jules...
- That is a great red.

198
00:09:00,854 --> 00:09:02,354
It is going to fly out of here.

199
00:09:02,355 --> 00:09:04,691
I needed you to sign off
on this, like, two hours ago.

200
00:09:04,692 --> 00:09:06,525
I know, I know, but can you try?

201
00:09:06,526 --> 00:09:07,593
Yep.

202
00:09:07,594 --> 00:09:09,328
Mia?
Tell me that thing again.

203
00:09:09,329 --> 00:09:12,465
Oh, 40% of our visitors
don't go past the homepage.

204
00:09:12,466 --> 00:09:14,433
Which isn't so bad.

205
00:09:14,434 --> 00:09:15,969
Yeah, but we should fix that.

206
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:17,637
Okay, here you go.

207
00:09:17,638 --> 00:09:18,570
I love it.

208
00:09:18,571 --> 00:09:20,005
Great, and it's up.

209
00:09:20,006 --> 00:09:22,057
Okay.
Thanks, everybody.

210
00:09:22,058 --> 00:09:24,109
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

211
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:26,813
Let's go over
the pitch for Friday.

212
00:09:26,814 --> 00:09:28,479
Okay, so...

213
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,681
the Antoinette dress.

214
00:09:29,682 --> 00:09:31,383
Major screw-Up
by the vendor.

215
00:09:31,384 --> 00:09:33,986
There's gonna be a couple of
interviews today, Ben.

216
00:09:33,987 --> 00:09:36,589
We want to make sure that
we both find the right fit.

217
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:38,558
Business as usual
is not really our motto,

218
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:40,525
So we hope
you have some fun here.

219
00:09:40,526 --> 00:09:43,229
This is the first time we're
hiring senior interns,

220
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:44,731
So some of our intern questions

221
00:09:44,732 --> 00:09:46,232
May not exactly fit
your profile,

222
00:09:46,233 --> 00:09:48,167
But we're gonna go for it
anyway, okay?

223
00:09:48,168 --> 00:09:49,251
Fire away.

224
00:09:49,252 --> 00:09:50,335
Okay, good.

225
00:09:50,336 --> 00:09:51,653
Where'd you go to school?

226
00:09:51,654 --> 00:09:52,971
I went to northwestern.

227
00:09:52,972 --> 00:09:55,141
Hey, my brother
went to northwestern.

228
00:09:55,142 --> 00:09:56,642
Probably not at the same time.

229
00:09:56,643 --> 00:09:59,211
Probably not.
He graduated in 2009.

230
00:09:59,212 --> 00:10:00,112
Class of '65.

231
00:10:01,014 --> 00:10:03,015
Wow, what was your major?

232
00:10:03,016 --> 00:10:04,751
Do you remember?

233
00:10:05,819 --> 00:10:08,788
And after northwestern
you went on to...?

234
00:10:08,789 --> 00:10:10,356
I went to work for dex one.

235
00:10:10,357 --> 00:10:12,858
- Okay, and they made...?
- Phonebooks.

236
00:10:12,859 --> 00:10:14,392
I was in charge of overseeing

237
00:10:14,393 --> 00:10:15,894
The printing
of the physical phonebook.

238
00:10:15,895 --> 00:10:17,796
I did that for over 20 years,
and before that,

239
00:10:17,797 --> 00:10:19,699
I was their
V.P. of sales and advertising.

240
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,900
So, do they still
make phonebooks?

241
00:10:21,901 --> 00:10:24,168
I mean, doesn't everyone
just Google numbers?

242
00:10:24,169 --> 00:10:26,439
I believe they do, but before Google
that was how you got a number.

243
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,440
Oh, no, no.
Yeah, I... I get it.

244
00:10:28,441 --> 00:10:30,143
So 40 years
at the phonebook company?

245
00:10:30,144 --> 00:10:32,178
That is amazing, seriously.

246
00:10:32,179 --> 00:10:33,645
Okay, Benjamin.

247
00:10:33,646 --> 00:10:35,715
Now, I'm gonna ask you one of
our more telling questions

248
00:10:35,716 --> 00:10:37,450
For all of our interns,
so I want you to, like,

249
00:10:37,451 --> 00:10:39,185
This is the one
to really think about, okay?

250
00:10:39,186 --> 00:10:40,852
And...
And take your time.

251
00:10:40,853 --> 00:10:43,023
Where do you see yourself
in 10 years?

252
00:10:44,457 --> 00:10:46,174
When I'm 80?

253
00:10:46,175 --> 00:10:47,534
Yeah, sure.

254
00:10:47,535 --> 00:10:48,895
Yeah, whatever.

255
00:10:48,896 --> 00:10:50,496
Um...

256
00:10:50,497 --> 00:10:52,264
wait.
Did not realize you were 70.

257
00:10:52,265 --> 00:10:54,967
That's, uh... That question just
doesn't work for you, does it?

258
00:10:54,968 --> 00:10:57,152
Should we just scratch that one
and just move on?

259
00:10:57,153 --> 00:10:59,338
- It's your call, Justin.
- Okay, that one's gone.

260
00:10:59,339 --> 00:11:00,739
You look great, by the way.
So great.

261
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:02,709
And you're clearly more than
qualified for this job.

262
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:04,209
You're actually, like,
way overqualified,

263
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:05,376
And we were so impressed.

264
00:11:05,377 --> 00:11:07,379
You had great interviews,
great video.

265
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:09,349
You nailed it, Ben.
Congrats.

266
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:10,917
You're an intern.

267
00:11:10,918 --> 00:11:12,017
- Hey.
- Hi.

268
00:11:12,018 --> 00:11:13,586
I need you for two minutes,
uninterrupted.

269
00:11:13,587 --> 00:11:14,886
- Okay.
- Remember a few weeks ago,

270
00:11:14,887 --> 00:11:16,555
We talked about
the senior intern program?

271
00:11:16,556 --> 00:11:18,123
- No.
- Really? We had a...

272
00:11:18,124 --> 00:11:20,226
We had a whole, big conversation
about it.

273
00:11:20,227 --> 00:11:21,593
We did?
Okay, remind me.

274
00:11:21,594 --> 00:11:23,062
Seniors in high school
or college?

275
00:11:23,063 --> 00:11:24,163
No, no, no, no.

276
00:11:24,164 --> 00:11:26,399
Seniors in life.
Older people.

277
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,899
Hold on, what?

278
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:30,069
I told you I felt like we needed
to do an outreach program.

279
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:32,037
You definitely seemed to be
liking the idea,

280
00:11:32,038 --> 00:11:34,006
So I set it in motion.
It's gonna be great.

281
00:11:34,007 --> 00:11:35,373
Hold, please.

282
00:11:35,374 --> 00:11:37,226
You're hiring
senior citizen interns?

283
00:11:37,227 --> 00:11:39,520
There's been
a ton of research on this,

284
00:11:39,521 --> 00:11:41,813
And the results
are actually incredible.

285
00:11:41,814 --> 00:11:44,650
I mean, imagine having an intern
with a lifetime of experience,

286
00:11:44,651 --> 00:11:46,051
As opposed to somebody who spent

287
00:11:46,052 --> 00:11:47,887
The last four years of their
life playing beer pong.

288
00:11:47,888 --> 00:11:49,705
Do they eventually
want jobs here?

289
00:11:49,706 --> 00:11:51,523
No, darling,
they're all retired.

290
00:11:51,524 --> 00:11:53,525
They... They just want
the experience.

291
00:11:53,526 --> 00:11:56,462
And I would like one
to work directly with you.

292
00:11:56,463 --> 00:11:58,597
Wait, Cameron, no.

293
00:11:58,598 --> 00:12:00,800
First of all,
I'm not great with older people.

294
00:12:00,801 --> 00:12:02,635
You know how I am
with my parents.

295
00:12:02,636 --> 00:12:04,403
This could be...

296
00:12:04,404 --> 00:12:05,637
why do I have to have one?

297
00:12:05,638 --> 00:12:07,138
Because you have to
set the tone.

298
00:12:07,139 --> 00:12:09,641
Now, would you prefer
a man or a woman?

299
00:12:09,642 --> 00:12:11,744
There's a great
72-Year-Old woman, really cute.

300
00:12:11,745 --> 00:12:13,279
That's like the same age
as my mom.

301
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,813
- That's too weird.
- That's fine.

302
00:12:14,814 --> 00:12:16,716
There's a man everyone loves.
He seems amazing.

303
00:12:16,717 --> 00:12:18,584
I watched his video
with the whole group.

304
00:12:18,585 --> 00:12:21,053
People were crying.

305
00:12:21,054 --> 00:12:23,389
Okay, this is not going to work,
in my opinion.

306
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:25,908
But how long
do I have to do this for?

307
00:12:25,909 --> 00:12:28,427
- Minimum?
- Six weeks or we'll be sued.

308
00:12:28,428 --> 00:12:30,830
I know we never
talked about this.

309
00:12:30,831 --> 00:12:32,732
Yeah, we did.
For real.

310
00:12:32,733 --> 00:12:34,534
He starts tomorrow.

311
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:50,083
Mm.

312
00:12:57,623 --> 00:12:59,592
Back in action.

313
00:12:59,593 --> 00:13:02,026
Thank god.

314
00:13:02,027 --> 00:13:04,763
New interns, welcome to ATF.

315
00:13:04,764 --> 00:13:07,066
We all work on this one floor,
and that is because

316
00:13:07,067 --> 00:13:10,403
We are all about
communication and teamwork.

317
00:13:10,404 --> 00:13:11,770
No one has a private office,

318
00:13:11,771 --> 00:13:14,106
Not even our founder and CEO,
Jules Ostin,

319
00:13:14,107 --> 00:13:17,308
Who is actually
right over there.

320
00:13:17,309 --> 00:13:19,879
She loves to ride her bike
through the office.

321
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,881
That woman does not
like to waste time.

322
00:13:21,882 --> 00:13:24,049
Plus, she counts it as exercise.

323
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:25,767
That's adorable.

324
00:13:25,768 --> 00:13:27,485
Yeah.
Mm-Hmm.

325
00:13:27,486 --> 00:13:29,655
Hey. How you doing?
I'm Davis.

326
00:13:29,656 --> 00:13:30,955
Hi, Davis.
Ben Whittaker.

327
00:13:30,956 --> 00:13:32,991
- Exciting place, huh?
- Oh, my god.

328
00:13:32,992 --> 00:13:35,728
They had one opening for a
regular-Age intern, no offense.

329
00:13:35,729 --> 00:13:37,396
I got it.
I'm so psyched.

330
00:13:37,397 --> 00:13:39,063
I'm pretty psyched myself.

331
00:13:39,064 --> 00:13:40,966
All right,
a few words about Jules.

332
00:13:40,967 --> 00:13:43,101
She started about the fit
only 18 months ago.

333
00:13:43,102 --> 00:13:45,304
This whole idea was hatched
at Jules' kitchen table

334
00:13:45,305 --> 00:13:46,572
Right here in Brooklyn.

335
00:13:46,573 --> 00:13:48,174
Jules tried everything on
that she sold,

336
00:13:48,175 --> 00:13:49,992
Described the fit herself,

337
00:13:49,993 --> 00:13:51,809
And apparently it worked.

338
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:54,129
She was online in four months.

339
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:56,449
She started with 25 employees.

340
00:13:56,450 --> 00:13:58,200
She's now up to 216.

341
00:13:58,201 --> 00:13:59,952
With you 4, 220.

342
00:13:59,953 --> 00:14:01,185
Wow.

343
00:14:01,186 --> 00:14:03,255
Hey, Ben, are you gonna
wear a suit every day?

344
00:14:03,256 --> 00:14:04,940
- You bet.
- Confident.

345
00:14:04,941 --> 00:14:06,784
I like how you roll.

346
00:14:06,785 --> 00:14:08,606
I like it a lot.

347
00:14:10,429 --> 00:14:14,799
- We just hit a record high of 2,500 likes on instagram.
- Yeah!

348
00:14:19,338 --> 00:14:20,672
And that's what we do

349
00:14:20,673 --> 00:14:22,441
When something good
happens around here.

350
00:14:22,442 --> 00:14:23,841
New interns, grab a seat

351
00:14:23,842 --> 00:14:25,477
At one of the intern tables
over there.

352
00:14:25,478 --> 00:14:27,780
Check your e-Mail. You may find
that you've been assigned

353
00:14:27,781 --> 00:14:30,649
To one particular person
or one particular team.

354
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:32,118
Or you might just be a floater.

355
00:14:32,119 --> 00:14:33,485
It's all good.

356
00:14:33,486 --> 00:14:36,155
Okay, let me instagram this.

357
00:14:36,156 --> 00:14:37,622
Moment in time.

358
00:14:37,623 --> 00:14:39,759
Gray is the new green.

359
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,027
Take a seat.

360
00:15:27,606 --> 00:15:29,908
Thanks.

361
00:15:32,078 --> 00:15:34,479
Got one.

362
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,250
"welcome Ben!
Your internship will be

363
00:15:37,251 --> 00:15:39,852
Directly with our founder,
Jules Ostin."

364
00:15:39,853 --> 00:15:42,588
Oh, I'm in the photo studio.

365
00:15:42,589 --> 00:15:44,623
Floater.
Love!

366
00:15:44,624 --> 00:15:46,024
Hey, Ben, what'd you get?

367
00:15:46,025 --> 00:15:48,193
Looks like I'm gonna be
a personal intern.

368
00:15:48,194 --> 00:15:49,495
Nice. To?

369
00:15:49,496 --> 00:15:51,213
Jules Ostin.

370
00:15:51,214 --> 00:15:52,932
Unfortunate.

371
00:15:54,233 --> 00:15:55,934
Hang in there.

372
00:15:59,538 --> 00:16:01,506
"hi Ben,
I have secured an appointment

373
00:16:01,507 --> 00:16:04,408
For you to meet with
Jules Ostin today at 3:55 p.m.

374
00:16:04,409 --> 00:16:08,147
Please be prompt as Jules has
another meeting at 4:00 p.m."

375
00:16:08,148 --> 00:16:11,182
Hmm.

376
00:16:11,183 --> 00:16:14,319
All right,
I'm going to merchandising.

377
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,722
Beautiful.

378
00:16:31,637 --> 00:16:33,238
It's perfect.

379
00:16:33,239 --> 00:16:35,307
Yes, I'll try to
have her there at 5:00.

380
00:16:35,308 --> 00:16:36,807
Um, no, wait.

381
00:16:36,808 --> 00:16:38,644
I booked her with a vendor
at 5:15.

382
00:16:38,645 --> 00:16:40,478
I'm sorry.

383
00:16:40,479 --> 00:16:42,315
I'll call you back.

384
00:16:42,316 --> 00:16:43,581
Yes, hello?

385
00:16:43,582 --> 00:16:44,950
Hi.
I'm Ben Whittaker.

386
00:16:44,951 --> 00:16:47,453
I have a 3:55 appointment
with Ms. Ostin.

387
00:16:47,454 --> 00:16:48,854
3:55?

388
00:16:48,855 --> 00:16:50,689
I thought she was meeting with
her new intern.

389
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:52,508
That's me.

390
00:16:52,509 --> 00:16:54,326
How you doing?

391
00:16:54,327 --> 00:16:56,828
I'm sorry, uh,
how are you an intern?

392
00:16:56,829 --> 00:16:59,331
W... It's the new
senior intern program.

393
00:16:59,332 --> 00:17:01,234
It just started today.

394
00:17:01,235 --> 00:17:02,435
Oh, my god.

395
00:17:02,436 --> 00:17:04,202
Um...

396
00:17:04,203 --> 00:17:05,304
how old are you?

397
00:17:05,305 --> 00:17:06,872
70. You?

398
00:17:06,873 --> 00:17:08,440
I'm 24.

399
00:17:08,441 --> 00:17:09,507
I know, I look older.

400
00:17:09,508 --> 00:17:10,609
It's the job.
It ages you.

401
00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:12,612
Which won't be great
in your case.

402
00:17:12,613 --> 00:17:13,912
Sorry.

403
00:17:13,913 --> 00:17:15,714
I actually thought
you looked younger.

404
00:17:15,715 --> 00:17:17,648
Yeah, right.

405
00:17:17,649 --> 00:17:20,787
Any tips before I go in?

406
00:17:21,854 --> 00:17:23,772
Just talk fast.
She hates slow talkers.

407
00:17:23,773 --> 00:17:25,691
Maybe that's just
when I talk slow.

408
00:17:25,692 --> 00:17:27,627
Don't dawdle in any way.
Just keep it moving.

409
00:17:27,628 --> 00:17:29,928
And don't forget to blink.

410
00:17:29,929 --> 00:17:31,362
- Blink?
- Yeah.

411
00:17:31,363 --> 00:17:33,399
She hates when people don't
blink. It weirds her out.

412
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,199
But it's 3:57.
This meeting that she's in

413
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,803
Just took up like two of your
f... They're out. Go, go, go.

414
00:17:37,804 --> 00:17:39,705
- Okay, thanks.
- Go. Yeah.

415
00:17:39,706 --> 00:17:40,738
What?

416
00:17:40,739 --> 00:17:42,141
Oh, yeah, I'm here.

417
00:17:42,142 --> 00:17:44,542
Hi, Jules?

418
00:17:44,543 --> 00:17:46,845
I'm Ben, your new intern.

419
00:17:46,846 --> 00:17:48,947
I'm glad you also
see the humor in this.

420
00:17:48,948 --> 00:17:51,350
Be hard not to.

421
00:17:51,351 --> 00:17:53,551
So, Ben...

422
00:17:53,552 --> 00:17:56,122
I was gonna say
what is a nice guy like you

423
00:17:56,123 --> 00:17:57,606
Doing at a place like this?

424
00:17:57,607 --> 00:17:59,082
But Cameron gave me the drill,

425
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:00,559
So can I just
be honest with you?

426
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:01,793
Please.

427
00:18:01,794 --> 00:18:03,629
I'm not gonna have
a lot for you to do.

428
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:04,962
That's the truth.

429
00:18:04,963 --> 00:18:07,465
And you being assigned to me
is kind of just

430
00:18:07,466 --> 00:18:10,351
For me to set an example
for the rest of the team.

431
00:18:10,352 --> 00:18:13,238
If you ask me, I think
that you'd be much better off

432
00:18:13,239 --> 00:18:14,639
Working in creative
or marketing.

433
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,040
It's a little bit slower pace,

434
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:17,508
Maybe a little bit
easier to grasp.

435
00:18:17,509 --> 00:18:19,845
If you requested to transfer,
we can make that happen.

436
00:18:19,846 --> 00:18:21,512
If that's what you'd prefer.

437
00:18:21,513 --> 00:18:25,484
You'll be happier, believe me.
I am not so fun to work for.

438
00:18:25,485 --> 00:18:28,487
That's what I gather,
but I can get along with anyone,

439
00:18:28,488 --> 00:18:30,556
And I'm here to
learn about your world,

440
00:18:30,557 --> 00:18:32,624
Give help where I can, so...

441
00:18:32,625 --> 00:18:34,693
so, you don't want to transfer?

442
00:18:34,694 --> 00:18:36,461
Not really, sir.

443
00:18:36,462 --> 00:18:38,230
I'm terribly sorry.

444
00:18:38,231 --> 00:18:39,598
Excuse me.

445
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:40,866
Okay.

446
00:18:40,867 --> 00:18:42,668
Well, then, looks like
you're stuck with me.

447
00:18:42,669 --> 00:18:44,302
Great, I'm excited.

448
00:18:44,303 --> 00:18:47,672
I will e-Mail you when
I have something for you to do.

449
00:18:47,673 --> 00:18:51,043
Or I could just stop by
a few times a day, check in...?

450
00:18:51,044 --> 00:18:52,410
I'll e-Mail you.

451
00:18:52,411 --> 00:18:54,847
Also, don't feel like
you have to dress up.

452
00:18:54,848 --> 00:18:56,247
I mean, we're super Cas here.

453
00:18:56,248 --> 00:18:59,451
Well, I'm comfortable in a suit,
if it's okay.

454
00:18:59,452 --> 00:19:00,869
No, it's fine.

455
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:02,112
Old school.

456
00:19:02,113 --> 00:19:03,354
Exactly.

457
00:19:03,355 --> 00:19:04,989
At least I'll stand out.

458
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:07,226
I don't think you need a suit
to do that.

459
00:19:07,227 --> 00:19:09,193
True.

460
00:19:09,194 --> 00:19:12,631
Well, I think we did it
in less than two minutes.

461
00:19:12,632 --> 00:19:14,533
I'll wait to hear from you.

462
00:19:14,534 --> 00:19:15,968
Okay.

463
00:19:18,237 --> 00:19:20,472
Want the door open or closed?

464
00:19:20,473 --> 00:19:21,841
Doesn't matter.

465
00:19:23,008 --> 00:19:25,178
Open, actually.

466
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,348
You'll get used to me.

467
00:19:29,349 --> 00:19:31,217
Look forward to it.

468
00:19:42,794 --> 00:19:44,946
Hi.

469
00:19:44,947 --> 00:19:47,099
Hi.

470
00:19:47,699 --> 00:19:49,100
Hi.

471
00:19:49,101 --> 00:19:50,602
Hi.

472
00:19:50,603 --> 00:19:52,103
Howdy.

473
00:19:52,104 --> 00:19:53,539
What do you need?

474
00:19:54,607 --> 00:19:55,842
No.

475
00:20:01,347 --> 00:20:03,916
What's up, Ben?
Are you good?

476
00:20:03,917 --> 00:20:05,534
Perfect.

477
00:20:05,535 --> 00:20:07,152
Okay.

478
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:16,595
The v-Neck back tee?

479
00:20:16,596 --> 00:20:17,662
This is holly.

480
00:20:17,663 --> 00:20:18,930
Can you run that up to them?

481
00:20:18,931 --> 00:20:20,800
Yeah, no, no, we love
the whole line, mark.

482
00:20:20,801 --> 00:20:22,351
Okay, so you can zoom out.

483
00:20:22,352 --> 00:20:23,911
- Like that.
- I'm going to a meeting.

484
00:20:23,912 --> 00:20:25,725
I'll be back in an hour.
We'll talk then?

485
00:20:25,726 --> 00:20:27,540
And then you can just
click here to buy it.

486
00:20:27,541 --> 00:20:29,808
Cool, yeah.

487
00:20:40,487 --> 00:20:41,787
Hello?

488
00:20:41,788 --> 00:20:43,322
Hi, yeah.

489
00:20:43,323 --> 00:20:44,857
All right.

490
00:20:44,858 --> 00:20:46,391
You staying?

491
00:20:46,392 --> 00:20:48,243
Can't leave
before the boss leaves, Davis.

492
00:20:48,244 --> 00:20:50,404
Looks like
you're gonna be here a while.

493
00:20:50,405 --> 00:20:52,565
All right.
See you in the morning, Ben.

494
00:20:52,566 --> 00:20:54,032
Have a good night.

495
00:20:54,033 --> 00:20:56,235
You, too.

496
00:21:06,244 --> 00:21:08,447
Let's make it happen.

497
00:21:09,915 --> 00:21:11,183
Thanks.

498
00:21:16,455 --> 00:21:18,090
How about I push, you deliver?

499
00:21:18,091 --> 00:21:19,791
Thank you.

500
00:21:19,792 --> 00:21:22,360
I like that there's four faves
instead of three,

501
00:21:22,361 --> 00:21:24,930
But can I see the one
without the jacket just to...

502
00:21:24,931 --> 00:21:26,115
sure.

503
00:21:26,116 --> 00:21:27,300
Hi.

504
00:21:29,167 --> 00:21:30,401
Okay, so they want to know

505
00:21:30,402 --> 00:21:31,803
What customers bought
who didn't come back

506
00:21:31,804 --> 00:21:33,439
So they can spot a problem
if there is one, right?

507
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,806
Yeah, but
I don't understand how to...

508
00:21:34,807 --> 00:21:36,341
All right, well, here's
what I think we should do.

509
00:21:36,342 --> 00:21:37,542
- Ben!
- We should go...

510
00:21:37,543 --> 00:21:39,411
Ben! Hey, look.
Here she comes.

511
00:21:39,412 --> 00:21:40,780
Watch how she won't even...

512
00:21:40,781 --> 00:21:42,648
Hey, beck.
What's up?

513
00:21:42,649 --> 00:21:44,517
You look really nice to...

514
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:47,585
How long can a woman
be mad at you for?

515
00:21:47,586 --> 00:21:49,888
Well, it kind of
depends on what you did.

516
00:21:49,889 --> 00:21:52,191
Well, first of all,
nothing on purpose.

517
00:21:52,192 --> 00:21:53,591
We were going out for a minute.

518
00:21:53,592 --> 00:21:56,295
I thought she was cool.
I really liked her.

519
00:21:56,296 --> 00:21:59,431
But then I sort of
accidentally...

520
00:21:59,432 --> 00:22:01,467
- slept with her roommate.
- That doesn't help.

521
00:22:01,468 --> 00:22:02,951
I didn't know
she was her roommate.

522
00:22:02,952 --> 00:22:04,436
I met her out.
How would I know that?

523
00:22:04,437 --> 00:22:06,838
- Hey, Nikki.
- Ben, tell me.

524
00:22:06,839 --> 00:22:07,973
I don't know this stuff.

525
00:22:07,974 --> 00:22:09,307
You're older.

526
00:22:09,308 --> 00:22:10,841
You've been through a lot.

527
00:22:10,842 --> 00:22:13,813
I mean, you... I mean,
you have a lot of experience.

528
00:22:13,814 --> 00:22:15,614
How long do you think
she'll be mad at me for?

529
00:22:15,615 --> 00:22:17,449
Jay, I have zero experience
with women,

530
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:19,552
And I can tell you, there's
no coming back from that one.

531
00:22:19,553 --> 00:22:21,653
I mean, I assume
you talked to her, apologized,

532
00:22:21,654 --> 00:22:23,656
Told her
how much she means to you.

533
00:22:23,657 --> 00:22:25,890
Well, you know...

534
00:22:25,891 --> 00:22:27,158
you didn't talk to her?

535
00:22:27,159 --> 00:22:28,694
What did you do,
send her a tweet?

536
00:22:28,695 --> 00:22:29,761
No, of course not.

537
00:22:29,762 --> 00:22:32,497
I, like, texted her
a billion times.

538
00:22:32,498 --> 00:22:35,433
She didn't answer,
so then I e-Mailed her.

539
00:22:35,434 --> 00:22:37,102
But it was like,
a nice e-Mail.

540
00:22:37,103 --> 00:22:38,954
It was a long one,
well thought out.

541
00:22:38,955 --> 00:22:40,806
Subject line I wrote,
"I'm sooorry,"

542
00:22:40,807 --> 00:22:42,172
With like a ton of O's.

543
00:22:42,173 --> 00:22:43,741
So it was like, "I'm sooorry,"

544
00:22:43,742 --> 00:22:47,546
With a sad emoticon
where he's crying

545
00:22:47,547 --> 00:22:50,315
At the side of its little cheek.

546
00:22:50,316 --> 00:22:53,118
I should probably actually
just talk to her, huh?

547
00:22:53,119 --> 00:22:54,318
Obviously.

548
00:22:54,319 --> 00:22:56,454
Can't imagine it would hurt.

549
00:22:56,455 --> 00:22:58,557
Oh, did yesterday's numbers
come in?

550
00:22:58,558 --> 00:23:00,191
Yeah.

551
00:23:00,192 --> 00:23:01,593
We could do it that way, too.

552
00:23:01,594 --> 00:23:03,862
I noticed my intern
sure keeps busy.

553
00:23:03,863 --> 00:23:05,213
Mr. Congeniality.

554
00:23:05,214 --> 00:23:06,406
He's a very big hit.

555
00:23:06,407 --> 00:23:07,598
Everybody loves him.

556
00:23:07,599 --> 00:23:09,083
Okay, do not look at that desk.

557
00:23:09,084 --> 00:23:11,027
It's like
the office junk drawer.

558
00:23:11,028 --> 00:23:12,972
It's just gonna drive you crazy.

559
00:23:12,973 --> 00:23:14,238
You just did that.

560
00:23:14,239 --> 00:23:16,041
What, are you
preparing for surgery?

561
00:23:16,042 --> 00:23:19,210
Okay, seriously?

562
00:23:19,211 --> 00:23:22,181
Like, how did this even happen?

563
00:23:30,956 --> 00:23:32,306
No, no, I-I can set it up.

564
00:23:32,307 --> 00:23:33,657
She's just in a meeting.

565
00:23:33,658 --> 00:23:35,326
Hi.
Something I can help you with?

566
00:23:35,327 --> 00:23:37,329
Yes, Jules spilled soy sauce
on her saint Laurent jacket.

567
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:38,662
Can you take it
to the photo studio?

568
00:23:38,663 --> 00:23:40,232
There's lots of cleaners
and stuff in there.

569
00:23:40,233 --> 00:23:41,433
Sure.
Where is it?

570
00:23:41,434 --> 00:23:42,633
She's wearing it.

571
00:23:42,634 --> 00:23:47,973
They would like us
to consider the possibility...

572
00:23:47,974 --> 00:23:49,374
okay.

573
00:23:49,375 --> 00:23:54,479
...of, uh, meeting with
some, uh, potential CEOs.

574
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,047
Wow.

575
00:23:56,048 --> 00:23:59,918
I did not see that coming.

576
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:03,221
W-Why? Uh...

577
00:24:03,222 --> 00:24:05,157
am I too inexperienced
at running a business?

578
00:24:05,158 --> 00:24:06,524
L-I didn't go to Harvard?

579
00:24:06,525 --> 00:24:09,761
My... My methods
aren't by the book?

580
00:24:09,762 --> 00:24:12,998
I mean,
isn't that how we got here?

581
00:24:12,999 --> 00:24:14,498
Really?

582
00:24:14,499 --> 00:24:16,667
I need adult supervision?

583
00:24:16,668 --> 00:24:18,836
Could we be doing better?

584
00:24:18,837 --> 00:24:21,807
We hit our five-Year goal
in nine months.

585
00:24:21,808 --> 00:24:23,174
Exactly.

586
00:24:23,175 --> 00:24:25,177
Jules, we can't keep up
with our own success.

587
00:24:25,178 --> 00:24:26,711
You know that.

588
00:24:26,712 --> 00:24:29,214
You're an hour late
to every meeting.

589
00:24:29,215 --> 00:24:31,449
We have a name for it...
Jules standard time.

590
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:34,185
And look, I get it. There's only
so many hours in the day.

591
00:24:34,186 --> 00:24:35,753
We're all playing catchup.

592
00:24:35,754 --> 00:24:38,557
Our tech guys work until
2:00, 3:00 in the morning.

593
00:24:38,558 --> 00:24:40,275
Customer service is slammed.

594
00:24:40,276 --> 00:24:41,993
We're running out of inventory.

595
00:24:41,994 --> 00:24:44,896
We've got shipping issues
and programming problems.

596
00:24:44,897 --> 00:24:46,164
And... And the bigger we get,

597
00:24:46,165 --> 00:24:48,016
The more complicated
it's gonna get.

598
00:24:48,017 --> 00:24:49,868
But isn't this
what a startup is?

599
00:24:49,869 --> 00:24:51,903
What?

600
00:24:51,904 --> 00:24:54,104
Say it. What is everyone
so worried about?

601
00:24:54,105 --> 00:24:57,409
That it's all going too fast,
and it could get away from us.

602
00:24:57,410 --> 00:25:00,545
Our investors just think
that a seasoned CEO

603
00:25:00,546 --> 00:25:02,513
Could take some things
off your plate.

604
00:25:02,514 --> 00:25:05,284
That's all. Just free you up
to do what you do great.

605
00:25:05,285 --> 00:25:06,651
You come up with the ideas,

606
00:25:06,652 --> 00:25:08,487
And let somebody else
make the trains run on time.

607
00:25:08,488 --> 00:25:09,988
But, Cameron, this new person,

608
00:25:09,989 --> 00:25:12,157
They are going to
want to do things their way.

609
00:25:12,158 --> 00:25:13,690
Technically be my boss.

610
00:25:13,691 --> 00:25:16,294
I mean, how can I do what I do

611
00:25:16,295 --> 00:25:18,330
If I have to
report to someone else,

612
00:25:18,331 --> 00:25:20,366
Run every idea I have
by this person?

613
00:25:20,367 --> 00:25:21,732
Can you see that working?

614
00:25:21,733 --> 00:25:24,002
Well,
gilt groupe brought in a CEO.

615
00:25:24,003 --> 00:25:25,771
How are they doing?

616
00:25:27,739 --> 00:25:30,742
I mean, get me CEO lessons,
you know?

617
00:25:32,444 --> 00:25:35,014
Uh, excuse me.

618
00:25:35,015 --> 00:25:36,780
I apologize,

619
00:25:36,781 --> 00:25:39,784
But Becky said you needed
something taken care of

620
00:25:39,785 --> 00:25:41,686
On your jacket.

621
00:25:41,687 --> 00:25:43,722
Oh, right.

622
00:25:53,898 --> 00:25:55,000
Thank you, Ben.

623
00:25:55,001 --> 00:25:56,669
Of course.

624
00:25:58,637 --> 00:26:02,408
The V.C.s made up a list
of potential CEOs.

625
00:26:02,409 --> 00:26:04,276
Let's just take a look
at the list.

626
00:26:04,277 --> 00:26:07,012
Explore it, then decide.

627
00:26:07,013 --> 00:26:08,747
Baby steps.

628
00:26:13,017 --> 00:26:14,285
Ben.

629
00:26:14,286 --> 00:26:15,954
Something big going on in there?

630
00:26:15,955 --> 00:26:17,255
I couldn't say.

631
00:26:17,256 --> 00:26:18,957
You were in there a long time.

632
00:26:18,958 --> 00:26:20,726
I can't hear a thing.

633
00:26:20,727 --> 00:26:22,660
Psst!

634
00:26:22,661 --> 00:26:24,528
Say something about me to her.

635
00:26:24,529 --> 00:26:27,266
No, you have to do it.

636
00:26:29,868 --> 00:26:31,936
On my way, boss.

637
00:26:31,937 --> 00:26:33,305
Hmm. Boss.

638
00:26:49,421 --> 00:26:50,822
Hey, Ben. Ben.

639
00:26:50,823 --> 00:26:52,423
How old's that briefcase?

640
00:26:52,424 --> 00:26:55,527
It's a 1973 executive Ashburn
attaché.

641
00:26:55,528 --> 00:26:57,112
They don't make it anymore.

642
00:26:57,113 --> 00:26:58,696
I'm a little in love with it.

643
00:26:58,697 --> 00:27:01,000
It's a classic, Lewis.
It's unbeatable.

644
00:27:03,969 --> 00:27:05,570
Good night.

645
00:27:05,571 --> 00:27:06,905
Bye.

646
00:27:27,192 --> 00:27:31,112
Oh, my god.
Somebody cleaned up that desk.

647
00:27:31,113 --> 00:27:35,033
I swear, I was gonna stay late
and do this myself.

648
00:27:35,034 --> 00:27:36,667
Wasn't me.

649
00:27:36,668 --> 00:27:39,104
Ben came in at 7:00 this morning
and did it.

650
00:27:39,105 --> 00:27:40,405
Who?

651
00:27:40,406 --> 00:27:41,706
Ben.

652
00:27:41,707 --> 00:27:43,691
Your intern.

653
00:27:43,692 --> 00:27:45,676
Ben Whittaker.

654
00:27:45,677 --> 00:27:48,146
Someone's very happy.

655
00:27:48,147 --> 00:27:50,615
Brilliant.
Thank you.

656
00:27:50,616 --> 00:27:52,918
Best thing that's happened
around here all week.

657
00:28:02,327 --> 00:28:04,430
Thank you.

658
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,769
This is your gift
for a job well done.

659
00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:15,406
I'm Fiona, the house masseuse.

660
00:28:15,407 --> 00:28:16,624
Hi, Fiona.

661
00:28:16,625 --> 00:28:17,842
- Hi.
- Ben.

662
00:28:17,843 --> 00:28:19,410
Hi.
Does that feel okay?

663
00:28:19,411 --> 00:28:21,229
It feels great, actually.
Thank you.

664
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:23,047
Okay. You're a little bit tight,
Ben.

665
00:28:23,048 --> 00:28:24,982
Well, I haven't sat at a desk
for a while.

666
00:28:24,983 --> 00:28:27,601
- My body's not used to it.
- No, I get it.

667
00:28:27,602 --> 00:28:30,221
Plus, they say
sitting is the new smoking.

668
00:28:30,222 --> 00:28:31,789
Let me see what I can do.

669
00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:34,292
I, uh, spotted you
in the lunchroom.

670
00:28:34,293 --> 00:28:35,560
I wondered who you were.

671
00:28:35,561 --> 00:28:36,828
- Did you? Oh.
- Yeah.

672
00:28:36,829 --> 00:28:38,813
Then someone told me
you were an intern.

673
00:28:38,814 --> 00:28:40,797
That's pretty cool of you
to do this.

674
00:28:40,798 --> 00:28:42,701
Well, it's a brave new world.
Thought I'd jump in.

675
00:28:42,702 --> 00:28:44,669
See what it's all about.

676
00:28:44,670 --> 00:28:46,637
Yeah, I know.
Absolutely.

677
00:28:46,638 --> 00:28:49,641
I'm constantly amazed
at what they do here.

678
00:28:49,642 --> 00:28:51,342
Love being a part of it.

679
00:28:51,343 --> 00:28:52,776
Oh.

680
00:28:52,777 --> 00:28:55,112
- Oh, my god.
- Yeah.

681
00:28:55,113 --> 00:28:57,448
There. Yeah.
Right there.

682
00:28:57,449 --> 00:28:59,449
How's that, Ben?

683
00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:02,087
Well, it's... Oh, boy.

684
00:29:02,088 --> 00:29:03,972
Good.

685
00:29:03,973 --> 00:29:05,856
Jason.

686
00:29:05,857 --> 00:29:08,560
Okay, good.
Good, good.

687
00:29:10,328 --> 00:29:12,296
There, good.

688
00:29:12,297 --> 00:29:14,265
Here you go.

689
00:29:14,266 --> 00:29:16,167
A little tight right here.

690
00:29:16,168 --> 00:29:17,334
Is that better?

691
00:29:17,335 --> 00:29:19,404
- Oh, boy, oh, boy.
- Oh, how's that?

692
00:29:19,405 --> 00:29:21,772
Oh, boy.

693
00:29:21,773 --> 00:29:24,007
Well, it was nice to meet you,
Ben.

694
00:29:24,008 --> 00:29:26,645
Love that there's another
oldie but goodie here.

695
00:29:26,646 --> 00:29:27,979
Nice to meet you.

696
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:29,314
See you later?

697
00:29:29,315 --> 00:29:30,615
Love to.

698
00:29:30,616 --> 00:29:31,917
Me, too.

699
00:29:37,589 --> 00:29:39,357
You're not as old
as I thought you were.

700
00:29:39,358 --> 00:29:40,859
Ooh!

701
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:45,197
Wait, so you're saying
you shave every day?

702
00:29:45,198 --> 00:29:46,630
- Yes.
- Even on Sundays?

703
00:29:46,631 --> 00:29:49,166
- Every day.
- Okay, and even if you know

704
00:29:49,167 --> 00:29:50,835
That you're not gonna see
anyone that you know?

705
00:29:50,836 --> 00:29:52,837
- Yes.
- How is this possible?

706
00:29:52,838 --> 00:29:54,839
I'm on
cheap apartments. Com,

707
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:57,442
And I literally can't afford
a single apartment

708
00:29:57,443 --> 00:29:58,876
In all of Brooklyn.

709
00:29:58,877 --> 00:30:01,679
My parents gave me two weeks
to find a place,

710
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,682
And that's just not
gonna happen.

711
00:30:03,683 --> 00:30:04,949
Getting evicted?

712
00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:07,585
Hey, I'm in no rush,
but apparently they are.

713
00:30:07,586 --> 00:30:10,988
All right, here.
Let me see your phone.

714
00:30:10,989 --> 00:30:13,525
Cheap apartments. Com.
Have you tried craigslist?

715
00:30:13,526 --> 00:30:16,795
- Yes.
- Okay. Then I am out of ideas.

716
00:30:24,269 --> 00:30:27,005
Jules. Hi.
How are you?

717
00:30:27,006 --> 00:30:28,774
Hi. How are you?

718
00:30:36,614 --> 00:30:37,681
- Hey.
- Hey.

719
00:30:37,682 --> 00:30:39,418
- How's it going?
- Well, good.

720
00:30:39,419 --> 00:30:41,585
- Mike, right?
- Yeah.

721
00:30:41,586 --> 00:30:43,337
Yeah, I'm Ben.
I work for Jules.

722
00:30:43,338 --> 00:30:45,089
- Yeah, she'll be down in a minute.
- I know.

723
00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:46,958
Look, I don't want to make you
feel uncomfortable,

724
00:30:46,959 --> 00:30:48,827
But I just happen to have
looked out the window,

725
00:30:48,828 --> 00:30:50,429
And it appeared
you were drinking something

726
00:30:50,430 --> 00:30:52,163
From a paper bag.

727
00:30:52,164 --> 00:30:54,533
I don't know
what you're talking about, man.

728
00:30:55,801 --> 00:30:57,835
Why don't you tell her
you can't drive her today,

729
00:30:57,836 --> 00:30:59,738
Or I'm gonna have to.

730
00:31:03,408 --> 00:31:05,010
We all good?

731
00:31:05,011 --> 00:31:06,545
Yeah.

732
00:31:15,653 --> 00:31:18,022
Jules, I'm sorry to do this,

733
00:31:18,023 --> 00:31:20,658
But I'm actually
not feeling so hot.

734
00:31:20,659 --> 00:31:21,926
Not sure I should be driving.

735
00:31:21,927 --> 00:31:23,127
I wouldn't want to
give you anything.

736
00:31:23,128 --> 00:31:24,228
Oh, sure.

737
00:31:24,229 --> 00:31:25,596
Yeah, no, you should
take the day off

738
00:31:25,597 --> 00:31:26,998
And feel better, okay?

739
00:31:26,999 --> 00:31:28,700
Thanks.

740
00:31:31,136 --> 00:31:33,154
I'm happy to cover for mike.

741
00:31:33,155 --> 00:31:35,172
That's okay.
Becky can drive me.

742
00:31:35,173 --> 00:31:37,543
Really?
You want to give her more to do?

743
00:31:42,114 --> 00:31:44,347
I hope you don't mind
if I don't get in the front.

744
00:31:44,348 --> 00:31:46,852
I- I'm not trying to be rude.
I just think better in the back.

745
00:31:46,853 --> 00:31:47,986
I mean, I could
get in the front, but...

746
00:31:47,987 --> 00:31:50,121
No, no, no.
This is perfect.

747
00:31:50,122 --> 00:31:51,221
Yeah.

748
00:31:54,292 --> 00:31:56,895
And everything you hear in the
car is strictly confidential.

749
00:31:56,896 --> 00:31:58,863
- Okay?
- Goes without saying.

750
00:31:58,864 --> 00:32:00,831
- Hi, mom.
- Oh, I found you.

751
00:32:00,832 --> 00:32:03,266
Yeah. So, what's up?
How's everything?

752
00:32:03,267 --> 00:32:05,203
Well, your dad and I
are finally putting together

753
00:32:05,204 --> 00:32:07,038
All our research
at the hospital.

754
00:32:07,656 --> 00:32:08,272
That's great.

755
00:32:08,273 --> 00:32:10,107
I hear you typing.

756
00:32:10,108 --> 00:32:11,942
That's better.

757
00:32:11,943 --> 00:32:13,844
So, we've been studying
women under 40

758
00:32:13,845 --> 00:32:15,746
Who sleep less than
six hours a night.

759
00:32:15,747 --> 00:32:18,049
- And what'd you find out?
- It's interesting.

760
00:32:18,050 --> 00:32:20,118
It seems like
they're 38% more likely

761
00:32:20,119 --> 00:32:21,852
To experience major weight gain

762
00:32:21,853 --> 00:32:24,289
Compared to women who slept
seven hours a night.

763
00:32:24,290 --> 00:32:25,622
Are you kidding me?

764
00:32:25,623 --> 00:32:27,524
You know I haven't slept
in two years.

765
00:32:27,525 --> 00:32:29,426
Well, I can't change
the facts, dear.

766
00:32:29,427 --> 00:32:32,497
Mom, you know what? I'm rushing into the
city for a meeting and I need to prepare.

767
00:32:32,498 --> 00:32:34,398
Can I call you when I get home?

768
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:36,200
Oh, you don't have to.

769
00:32:36,201 --> 00:32:37,968
- Okay. Love you.
- Thank you.

770
00:32:43,910 --> 00:32:45,209
Hey, how we doing?

771
00:32:45,210 --> 00:32:47,345
Did you look over
the material on at wood?

772
00:32:47,346 --> 00:32:48,779
Yeah, I did.

773
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:51,449
Uh, he had a great run at
travelocity and Citigroup...

774
00:32:51,450 --> 00:32:52,883
and I get it.
He's major.

775
00:32:52,884 --> 00:32:54,951
He is.
And the best thing about him

776
00:32:54,952 --> 00:32:57,723
Is he's been watching us,
and he loves what we're doing.

777
00:32:57,724 --> 00:32:59,057
But he's only one of the names
on the list.

778
00:32:59,058 --> 00:33:00,825
So if you don't like him,
we move on.

779
00:33:00,826 --> 00:33:02,843
But, Jules, try to be open.

780
00:33:02,844 --> 00:33:04,937
He's supposed to be brilliant.

781
00:33:04,938 --> 00:33:07,031
And the V.C.s love him.
A lot.

782
00:33:07,032 --> 00:33:09,234
Mark Zuckerberg
never brought in a CEO,

783
00:33:09,235 --> 00:33:10,835
And he was a teenager.

784
00:33:10,836 --> 00:33:12,437
Call me after.

785
00:33:12,438 --> 00:33:14,640
Okay.

786
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:17,876
Oh, thanks,
but you don't have to.

787
00:33:17,877 --> 00:33:19,476
- I can open the door.
- Sure.

788
00:33:19,477 --> 00:33:21,980
Okay, so, this shouldn't
take more than an hour.

789
00:33:21,981 --> 00:33:23,280
But if you can't stay here,

790
00:33:23,281 --> 00:33:25,083
I'll call Becky
and then she'll find you.

791
00:33:25,084 --> 00:33:26,384
And then you can just pull up...

792
00:33:26,385 --> 00:33:28,686
Don't worry.
I'll be here.

793
00:33:28,687 --> 00:33:30,821
I think I forgot to eat today.

794
00:33:30,822 --> 00:33:32,957
Should I pick you up some sushi?

795
00:33:32,958 --> 00:33:34,892
No, I eat too much mercury.

796
00:33:34,893 --> 00:33:36,827
I'll be fine.
I'm good.

797
00:33:36,828 --> 00:33:38,663
I'm actually kind of nauseous,
so...

798
00:34:11,629 --> 00:34:12,997
That was fast.

799
00:34:12,998 --> 00:34:14,365
Not fast enough.

800
00:34:14,366 --> 00:34:17,235
Oh, I-I picked you up some soup
from a place I know.

801
00:34:17,236 --> 00:34:18,268
Thanks.

802
00:34:18,269 --> 00:34:21,573
You really didn't have to d...
To do...

803
00:34:21,574 --> 00:34:23,541
Oh, my god, that smells so good.

804
00:34:23,542 --> 00:34:24,876
Good.

805
00:34:27,979 --> 00:34:29,763
Word travels fast.

806
00:34:29,764 --> 00:34:31,548
Pretty short meeting.

807
00:34:31,549 --> 00:34:33,684
- Yeah. I hated him.
- Really? What happened?

808
00:34:33,685 --> 00:34:36,788
I thought he was a condescending,
sexist know-It-All

809
00:34:36,789 --> 00:34:38,955
Who did not seem to get
what we do at all.

810
00:34:38,956 --> 00:34:41,208
And, honestly, I think
he would run our business

811
00:34:41,209 --> 00:34:43,753
In a completely inorganic way
that would lose us

812
00:34:43,754 --> 00:34:46,298
All the customers
we have killed ourselves to get.

813
00:34:46,299 --> 00:34:48,333
Oh, and I think
that he would replace us

814
00:34:48,334 --> 00:34:49,867
As soon as he got the chance.

815
00:34:49,868 --> 00:34:51,068
Oh, and...

816
00:34:51,069 --> 00:34:54,072
The man never blinked.

817
00:34:54,073 --> 00:34:56,308
An Olympian non-Blinker.

818
00:34:56,309 --> 00:34:58,176
Okay, then.

819
00:34:58,177 --> 00:34:59,442
Yeah.

820
00:34:59,443 --> 00:35:01,995
See you in the a.m.?

821
00:35:01,996 --> 00:35:04,549
Be there or be square.

822
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:06,351
I'm sorry.

823
00:35:06,352 --> 00:35:08,153
Hey, don't be.

824
00:35:30,775 --> 00:35:33,411
I just wanted to say thank you
for helping out with mike today

825
00:35:33,412 --> 00:35:35,112
And for getting me chicken soup.

826
00:35:35,113 --> 00:35:38,583
Oh, and for cleaning that mess.
That was awesome.

827
00:35:38,584 --> 00:35:39,883
Seriously.

828
00:35:39,884 --> 00:35:41,853
You're very welcome.

829
00:35:44,022 --> 00:35:46,590
It's okay.
I really won't bite.

830
00:35:46,591 --> 00:35:50,328
You started this business all by
yourself a year and a half ago,

831
00:35:50,329 --> 00:35:52,797
And now you have
a staff of 220 people.

832
00:35:52,798 --> 00:35:54,598
Remember who did that.

833
00:35:54,599 --> 00:35:55,766
Who?

834
00:35:57,852 --> 00:35:59,936
Um, thank you.

835
00:35:59,937 --> 00:36:03,141
And I hate to say it,
but try to get some sleep.

836
00:36:06,043 --> 00:36:07,879
- Mommy.
- Hey!

837
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:08,979
Hi.

838
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:11,516
- Hi.
- Here's my favorite girl.

839
00:36:11,517 --> 00:36:14,519
Hey, baby.

840
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:16,054
- Hi, honey.
- Hey.

841
00:36:17,355 --> 00:36:19,224
Over the hump.

842
00:36:21,525 --> 00:36:22,759
So, how was your day?

843
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,394
Kind of okay.
But you know what?

844
00:36:24,395 --> 00:36:27,365
Maddie said she didn't want to
be my friend anymore.

845
00:36:27,366 --> 00:36:28,532
Oh.

846
00:36:28,533 --> 00:36:30,268
You know what?
I don't think she meant it.

847
00:36:30,269 --> 00:36:32,135
She'd miss you too much.

848
00:36:32,136 --> 00:36:35,973
I'm starting to think
that Maddie is bipolar.

849
00:36:35,974 --> 00:36:38,376
We go through this
every other day.

850
00:36:38,377 --> 00:36:39,476
We do.

851
00:36:39,477 --> 00:36:41,913
Oh, how was your meeting?
It was today, right?

852
00:36:41,914 --> 00:36:43,580
Yeah, just had it.

853
00:36:43,581 --> 00:36:45,950
Mommy, I think I'm winning.
Look!

854
00:36:45,951 --> 00:36:47,918
Oh, that is so cool.

855
00:36:47,919 --> 00:36:50,222
Yeah, that's
the play-doh cake challenge.

856
00:36:50,223 --> 00:36:51,889
We're not finishing
until tomorrow,

857
00:36:51,890 --> 00:36:54,124
So please hold on all judging.

858
00:36:54,125 --> 00:36:56,560
Not to mention that we had
an accident with mine

859
00:36:56,561 --> 00:37:00,131
When someone, not to name
any names, put her elbow in it.

860
00:37:00,132 --> 00:37:02,298
- What?
- It was an accident.

861
00:37:02,299 --> 00:37:05,236
Well, I got to say,
I love the pink one a lot.

862
00:37:05,237 --> 00:37:07,537
That's mine.
Are you happy at me?

863
00:37:07,538 --> 00:37:11,075
I am so happy at you.
I'm beyond happy at you.

864
00:37:11,076 --> 00:37:13,077
Daddy helped me with the icing.

865
00:37:13,078 --> 00:37:14,578
Good job, you guys.

866
00:37:14,579 --> 00:37:16,213
So, how about
I give you your bath, okay?

867
00:37:16,214 --> 00:37:17,848
Wait, hang on.
I was waiting for your call.

868
00:37:17,849 --> 00:37:20,050
So, you didn't like the guy?

869
00:37:20,051 --> 00:37:22,252
He wasn't a good fit for me.

870
00:37:22,253 --> 00:37:25,623
But a lot of other names
on the list, so...

871
00:37:25,624 --> 00:37:26,757

872
00:37:26,758 --> 00:37:28,593

That's right, homey.
Ben's got a job.

877
00:37:41,073 --> 00:37:43,106
Oh, you're never home.

878
00:37:43,107 --> 00:37:46,411

Hello?

884
00:38:05,213 --> 00:38:06,596
Hi, uh, Fiona.

885
00:38:06,597 --> 00:38:09,216
It's Ben Whittaker
from about the fit.

886
00:38:09,217 --> 00:38:11,327
Oh, hey.
It's good to hear your voice.

887
00:38:11,328 --> 00:38:13,438
Oh, it's good
to hear your voice, too.

888
00:38:13,439 --> 00:38:15,639
It was great meeting you today.

889
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:18,109
I called you quicker
than you thought I would.

890
00:38:18,110 --> 00:38:20,145
I'm glad you did.

891
00:38:30,055 --> 00:38:31,755
Jules.

892
00:38:31,756 --> 00:38:34,692
Shh.
Let her sleep, dad.

893
00:38:34,693 --> 00:38:37,111
Okay.

894
00:38:37,112 --> 00:38:39,531
Okay.

895
00:38:43,468 --> 00:38:45,168
When I heard that,
I was like, "good,

896
00:38:45,169 --> 00:38:47,838
Because I definitely wasn't
eating lunchables before."

897
00:38:50,341 --> 00:38:52,209
Yeah, they're coming out with

898
00:38:52,210 --> 00:38:54,044
A more grown-Up version
of lunchables.

899
00:38:54,045 --> 00:38:56,447
Uh, they're called
so you still can't cook-ables.

900
00:38:56,448 --> 00:38:59,083
Uh, grow-up-ables already.

901
00:39:07,758 --> 00:39:09,494
I tried to stay up.

902
00:39:09,495 --> 00:39:11,128
I know.

903
00:39:11,129 --> 00:39:14,231
I'm sorry I fell asleep
in there. I just passed out.

904
00:39:14,232 --> 00:39:17,334
I know we had a plan to have
a grown-Up conversation.

905
00:39:17,335 --> 00:39:20,338
You want to Netflix something?

906
00:39:26,877 --> 00:39:28,344
Hm?

907
00:39:28,345 --> 00:39:30,981
I'm sorry.
I just fell out for a second.

908
00:39:30,982 --> 00:39:33,216
It's okay.

909
00:39:33,217 --> 00:39:35,787
Paige learned to say
"humongous" today.

910
00:39:35,788 --> 00:39:36,953
Really?

911
00:39:36,954 --> 00:39:38,388
Cracks me up.

912
00:39:38,389 --> 00:39:40,424
She looks at me, she says,

913
00:39:40,425 --> 00:39:43,961
"You're a very humongous dad,
dad."

914
00:39:43,962 --> 00:39:44,961
Oh.

915
00:39:46,864 --> 00:39:50,283
Oh, god. You know I hate
to sound like the other moms.

916
00:39:50,284 --> 00:39:53,704
But I'm starting to feel like
I need a little me time.

917
00:39:53,705 --> 00:39:56,474
I know.

918
00:40:03,515 --> 00:40:05,050
Good night.

919
00:40:11,856 --> 00:40:14,090
Anybody home?

920
00:40:14,091 --> 00:40:16,393
Can't keep my eyes open, Jule.

921
00:40:16,394 --> 00:40:18,696
We'll do it tomorrow, okay?

922
00:40:33,210 --> 00:40:35,313
Can you turn out your light?

923
00:40:52,698 --> 00:40:53,597
Hello?

924
00:40:53,598 --> 00:40:55,082
Hey, Ben.
It's Becky.

925
00:40:55,083 --> 00:40:56,558
From Jules' office?

926
00:40:56,559 --> 00:40:57,914
Yeah, hey.
What's up?

927
00:40:57,915 --> 00:40:59,269
Jules' driver is M.I.A.

928
00:40:59,270 --> 00:41:00,771
He's not answering
any of my texts.

929
00:41:00,772 --> 00:41:02,206
I know
you drove Jules yesterday,

930
00:41:02,207 --> 00:41:03,691
And I didn't hear
any complaints.

931
00:41:03,692 --> 00:41:05,501
So can you pick her up
this morning?

932
00:41:05,502 --> 00:41:07,311
- Sure.
- You know where she lives?

933
00:41:07,312 --> 00:41:10,148
- I was there yesterday.
- Okay, so you remember.

934
00:41:10,149 --> 00:41:11,949
- Yeah.
- And you're hearing me, right?

935
00:41:11,950 --> 00:41:13,550
Loud and clear, boss.

936
00:41:13,551 --> 00:41:15,986
Okay, so be there at 7:45,
ring the bell, and walk away.

937
00:41:15,987 --> 00:41:17,087
She'll know it's you.

938
00:41:17,088 --> 00:41:18,756
Ring bell, walk away.
Got it.

939
00:41:24,345 --> 00:41:26,464
Oh, walk away.

940
00:41:27,265 --> 00:41:29,049
Hang on.
I'm coming.

941
00:41:29,050 --> 00:41:30,834
Hi. Here for Jules?

942
00:41:30,835 --> 00:41:32,536
Yeah, hi, sorry.
I'll wait in the car.

943
00:41:32,537 --> 00:41:34,972
Uh, she's on a call.
Do you want to come in?

944
00:41:34,973 --> 00:41:36,340
I just made some coffee.

945
00:41:36,341 --> 00:41:37,675
Could be a while.

946
00:41:37,676 --> 00:41:38,843
I'm Matt.

947
00:41:40,611 --> 00:41:41,611
Ben Whittaker.

948
00:41:41,612 --> 00:41:43,313
Good to meet you.
Come on in.

949
00:41:43,314 --> 00:41:45,817
Legos everywhere,
so watch your step.

950
00:41:45,818 --> 00:41:47,050
Sure.

951
00:41:47,051 --> 00:41:49,821
Maybe feature some
bloggers on the homepage?

952
00:41:49,822 --> 00:41:51,522
Have a seat, Ben.

953
00:41:51,523 --> 00:41:53,457
Hey, Paige, this is Ben.
He works with mommy.

954
00:41:53,458 --> 00:41:54,691
- Hi.
- Hi.

955
00:41:54,692 --> 00:41:56,526
I'm playing
princess memory game.

956
00:41:56,527 --> 00:41:59,230
Oh, yeah.
Looks like you're about to win.

957
00:41:59,231 --> 00:42:01,098
So, your Jules' new driver?

958
00:42:01,099 --> 00:42:02,967
No, actually, I'm her intern.

959
00:42:02,968 --> 00:42:05,201
That's hysterical.

960
00:42:05,202 --> 00:42:07,271
- You know what an intern is?
- No.

961
00:42:07,272 --> 00:42:09,107
That's okay.
Everyone thinks it's hysterical.

962
00:42:09,108 --> 00:42:11,909
Hey, Matt, did a...

963
00:42:11,910 --> 00:42:14,061
Morning.

964
00:42:14,062 --> 00:42:16,212
Morning.

965
00:42:16,213 --> 00:42:18,348
Is that all
dry-Cleaning?

966
00:42:18,349 --> 00:42:20,734
These three are.
These two are laundry.

967
00:42:20,735 --> 00:42:23,120
And this button...
This button is missing.

968
00:42:23,121 --> 00:42:24,587
I mean, it's loose, so...

969
00:42:24,588 --> 00:42:25,623
- okay.
- If they could just...

970
00:42:25,624 --> 00:42:26,923
- you got it.
- Thanks.

971
00:42:26,924 --> 00:42:28,308
Hey, and, honey,
uh, before you leave,

972
00:42:28,309 --> 00:42:29,694
Just got to
go over a couple things.

973
00:42:29,695 --> 00:42:30,760
Okay.

974
00:42:30,761 --> 00:42:33,230
- Look who I found.
- Yay!

975
00:42:33,231 --> 00:42:35,248
- He was in your hamper.
- Thank you.

976
00:42:35,249 --> 00:42:37,267
Matty,
did an ATF box arrive for me?

977
00:42:37,268 --> 00:42:38,668
On the table.

978
00:42:38,669 --> 00:42:40,671
Uh, I... I think
I'll just wait... Wait out...

979
00:42:40,672 --> 00:42:43,174
Ben.
Do you want a raisin?

980
00:42:43,175 --> 00:42:45,676
Thank you.

981
00:42:45,677 --> 00:42:48,128
Okay, so tonight,
you're working...

982
00:42:48,129 --> 00:42:50,581
are you listening,
or did I lose you?

983
00:42:50,582 --> 00:42:51,849
Ben, is she listening?

984
00:42:51,850 --> 00:42:53,116
I am totally listening.

985
00:42:53,117 --> 00:42:55,486
I ordered some stuff
to check on how it arrived.

986
00:42:55,487 --> 00:42:57,488
Not great, by the way.

987
00:42:57,489 --> 00:42:58,688
Go on.
Tonight?

988
00:42:58,689 --> 00:43:00,490
Yeah, okay.
You're working,

989
00:43:00,491 --> 00:43:03,328
So Paige and I are gonna
go to my mom's for dinner.

990
00:43:03,329 --> 00:43:05,363
After school's
ruby's birthday party.

991
00:43:05,364 --> 00:43:07,063
And, uh, what about next Monday?

992
00:43:07,064 --> 00:43:09,200
Do you know yet if we can go to
dinner with Robbie and Annie?

993
00:43:09,201 --> 00:43:11,803
Oh, I'm so slammed next week.

994
00:43:12,903 --> 00:43:15,306
I'm sorry.
If you want to go, I'll make it.

995
00:43:15,307 --> 00:43:18,009
- When was it?
- Oh, my god. Monday.

996
00:43:19,543 --> 00:43:22,180
Okay, I'm sorry. I was fixated
on this tissue paper.

997
00:43:22,181 --> 00:43:23,581
I will be there.

998
00:43:23,582 --> 00:43:24,947
Okay.

999
00:43:24,948 --> 00:43:28,085
Thank you for the coffee.
Thanks for letting me play.

1000
00:43:28,086 --> 00:43:29,218
Oh! Sorry.

1001
00:43:29,219 --> 00:43:30,520
I'll meet you in the car.

1002
00:43:30,521 --> 00:43:32,372
Actually, I have to go.
Come on, sweetie.

1003
00:43:32,373 --> 00:43:34,225
Ben, we're gonna
drop Paige at school, okay?

1004
00:43:34,226 --> 00:43:36,410
- Here we go.
- Let's do it.

1005
00:43:36,411 --> 00:43:38,595
Kiss daddy goodbye.
Mwah!

1006
00:43:38,596 --> 00:43:41,966
Hey, wait.
You forgot your doggy.

1007
00:43:45,870 --> 00:43:47,771
- Matt seems like a terrific guy.
- Hmm?

1008
00:43:47,772 --> 00:43:50,490
Sorry, didn't mean to interrupt.

1009
00:43:50,491 --> 00:43:53,210
Uh, that's okay.
I agree. He is.

1010
00:43:53,211 --> 00:43:54,711
Who? The dad?

1011
00:43:54,712 --> 00:43:56,813
That's what the other kids
call Matt

1012
00:43:56,814 --> 00:43:59,650
Because he's the only dad
in a sea of moms.

1013
00:43:59,651 --> 00:44:01,117
I've read about
these househusbands.

1014
00:44:01,118 --> 00:44:03,019
It's interesting
how that all worked just now.

1015
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:06,357
They actually prefer to be
called stay-At-Home dads.

1016
00:44:06,358 --> 00:44:08,325
Oh, sorry.
Did not know that.

1017
00:44:08,326 --> 00:44:10,293
Well, it's very admirable.

1018
00:44:10,294 --> 00:44:12,263
He's a real
21st-Century father.

1019
00:44:12,264 --> 00:44:13,563
He is.

1020
00:44:13,564 --> 00:44:15,549
He actually
had a great job in marketing,

1021
00:44:15,550 --> 00:44:17,535
But, um,
when about the fit took off,

1022
00:44:17,536 --> 00:44:20,204
He left
to be a full-Time dad.

1023
00:44:20,205 --> 00:44:22,807
Totally saved our butts.

1024
00:44:35,553 --> 00:44:37,721
Oh, we're here, big girl.

1025
00:44:37,722 --> 00:44:39,889
I do this in the cafeteria

1026
00:44:39,890 --> 00:44:43,227
To my lunch friends
when they're don't looking.

1027
00:44:43,228 --> 00:44:45,078
- You do that?
- Hey, Jules.

1028
00:44:45,079 --> 00:44:46,929
Hi.
Nice to see you here.

1029
00:44:46,930 --> 00:44:48,532
Uh, not sure
if you got our e-Mail,

1030
00:44:48,533 --> 00:44:50,367
But we're doing a fiesta lunch
next Friday,

1031
00:44:50,368 --> 00:44:52,202
And we thought
you could bring the guacamole.

1032
00:44:52,203 --> 00:44:55,406
Uh, you probably won't have time
to make it, so you can buy it.

1033
00:44:55,407 --> 00:44:57,224
Which is fine.

1034
00:44:57,225 --> 00:44:59,042
Enough for 18.

1035
00:44:59,043 --> 00:45:00,777
No, I can make it.
It's not a problem.

1036
00:45:00,778 --> 00:45:02,880
Great.
Matt can bring it.

1037
00:45:02,881 --> 00:45:04,314
Totally.

1038
00:45:04,315 --> 00:45:05,748
Bye.

1039
00:45:05,749 --> 00:45:08,586
All right.
Have a great day, sweet pea.

1040
00:45:08,587 --> 00:45:10,053
Have fun at ruby's party, okay?

1041
00:45:10,054 --> 00:45:13,457
Mommy? Do you know how
to make guacamole?

1042
00:45:13,458 --> 00:45:15,024
Yes, I do.
Really well, in fact.

1043
00:45:15,025 --> 00:45:16,826
We're...
We're gonna make it together.

1044
00:45:16,827 --> 00:45:19,063
And after that, we'll have
a mother-Daughter dance party?

1045
00:45:21,298 --> 00:45:23,434
Hey, Maddie.
What's up?

1046
00:45:26,103 --> 00:45:27,821
Bipolar.

1047
00:45:27,822 --> 00:45:29,298
Oh, my god.

1048
00:45:29,299 --> 00:45:30,774
Come here.

1049
00:45:30,775 --> 00:45:32,209
Oh, I love you, big girl.

1050
00:45:32,210 --> 00:45:33,844
I love you, too.

1051
00:45:33,845 --> 00:45:36,345
God.

1052
00:45:36,346 --> 00:45:38,682
- Taking the high road is exhausting.
- It's 2015.

1053
00:45:40,551 --> 00:45:42,620
Are we really still critical
of working moms?

1054
00:45:42,621 --> 00:45:45,321
Seriously? Still?

1055
00:45:45,322 --> 00:45:48,659
I'm sorry.
That was all rhetorical.

1056
00:45:48,660 --> 00:45:50,227
There's no need to respond.

1057
00:45:50,228 --> 00:45:52,313
Wasn't going to.

1058
00:46:08,913 --> 00:46:10,280
Oh, Ben.

1059
00:46:10,281 --> 00:46:11,682
I want to stop by the warehouse.

1060
00:46:11,683 --> 00:46:13,350
480 greenpoint.

1061
00:46:13,351 --> 00:46:14,685
Sure.

1062
00:46:15,886 --> 00:46:18,021
No, no, no, no.
You want to make a right.

1063
00:46:18,022 --> 00:46:19,956
9th to Hamilton
to the expressway.

1064
00:46:19,957 --> 00:46:23,160
Uh, I think we should take
4th to Flatbush. Much faster.

1065
00:46:23,161 --> 00:46:25,695
L-It won't be.

1066
00:46:25,696 --> 00:46:27,898
By 12 minutes, at least.

1067
00:46:27,899 --> 00:46:29,133
Can I try?

1068
00:46:32,036 --> 00:46:33,537
I apologize.

1069
00:46:33,538 --> 00:46:35,038
No need.

1070
00:46:35,039 --> 00:46:39,277
Try to line the dots up
the best you can.

1071
00:46:39,278 --> 00:46:41,045
And then...

1072
00:46:41,046 --> 00:46:42,212
okay.

1073
00:46:42,213 --> 00:46:45,282
If you can,
try to pull this towards you,

1074
00:46:45,283 --> 00:46:46,350
Holding it on the outside.

1075
00:46:46,351 --> 00:46:48,686
Good meeting you.

1076
00:46:53,424 --> 00:46:55,275
Okay, so then
put that on lightly.

1077
00:46:55,276 --> 00:46:57,128
Put it down with two.
Secure it.

1078
00:47:00,030 --> 00:47:01,932
Our package should feel like
they're getting

1079
00:47:01,933 --> 00:47:03,835
A little gift
that they bought for themselves.

1080
00:47:06,003 --> 00:47:08,488
♪ Tall and tan
and young and lovely?

1081
00:47:08,489 --> 00:47:10,974
♪ The girl from ipanema
goes walking?

1082
00:47:10,975 --> 00:47:14,478
It's open.

1083
00:47:14,479 --> 00:47:15,545
Ben.

1084
00:47:15,546 --> 00:47:17,047
- Wow.
- Come on in.

1085
00:47:17,048 --> 00:47:19,049
- Didn't expect this.
- Yeah.

1086
00:47:19,050 --> 00:47:21,719
I like to think of it
as a little bit of paradise.

1087
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:24,287
- Can I interest you in a back rub?
- Oh, no, thanks.

1088
00:47:24,288 --> 00:47:26,923
I just came by because
I found out I have to work late.

1089
00:47:26,924 --> 00:47:28,892
Oh.
Then no dinner tonight.

1090
00:47:28,893 --> 00:47:31,127
Sorry. I was really
looking forward to it.

1091
00:47:31,128 --> 00:47:33,363
But I'm hoping
we can pick another night.

1092
00:47:33,364 --> 00:47:35,215
Of course.
Come sit down.

1093
00:47:35,216 --> 00:47:36,891
Let me have your jacket.

1094
00:47:36,892 --> 00:47:38,568
- Oh.
- Just for a minute.

1095
00:47:38,569 --> 00:47:40,503
Come on. Relax.

1096
00:47:40,504 --> 00:47:43,240
Okay, how about a foot massage?

1097
00:47:43,241 --> 00:47:44,607
During office hours?

1098
00:47:44,608 --> 00:47:46,844
Yeah, that's kind of the point.

1099
00:47:46,845 --> 00:47:49,513
- May I?
- Well...

1100
00:47:49,514 --> 00:47:51,682
okay.

1101
00:47:54,218 --> 00:47:55,518
It's already pretty good.

1102
00:47:55,519 --> 00:47:57,570
All I've done
is take off your sock.

1103
00:47:57,571 --> 00:47:59,623
Well,
no one's ever done that better.

1104
00:47:59,624 --> 00:48:01,290
Just relax.

1105
00:48:01,291 --> 00:48:02,775
Close your eyes.

1106
00:48:02,776 --> 00:48:04,261
Put your head back.

1107
00:48:04,262 --> 00:48:05,695
Oh.

1108
00:48:05,696 --> 00:48:07,698
So, when would you
like to reschedule?

1109
00:48:07,699 --> 00:48:09,132
Tomorrow?

1110
00:48:09,133 --> 00:48:11,402
Can't tomorrow.
What about Saturday?

1111
00:48:11,403 --> 00:48:12,635
Good.

1112
00:48:12,636 --> 00:48:15,406
Oh, god.
This is enormously satisfying.

1113
00:48:15,407 --> 00:48:17,124
What time should I pick you up?

1114
00:48:17,125 --> 00:48:18,984
Noon?
I love daytime dates.

1115
00:48:18,985 --> 00:48:21,098
Lunch, perfect.
It's sooner.

1116
00:48:21,099 --> 00:48:23,212
So, how's it going?
How's Jules?

1117
00:48:23,213 --> 00:48:26,049
I mean, she works on
all cylinders all the time.

1118
00:48:26,050 --> 00:48:28,886
Doesn't stop, doesn't sleep,
never see her eat.

1119
00:48:28,887 --> 00:48:31,355
Maybe it's good that I'm here,
you know?

1120
00:48:31,356 --> 00:48:33,156
I hope I can help her.

1121
00:48:33,157 --> 00:48:36,293
I knew
you were gonna be a good guy.

1122
00:48:36,294 --> 00:48:37,762
I knew it.

1123
00:48:39,262 --> 00:48:41,031
Try to relax.

1124
00:48:41,032 --> 00:48:42,516
Oh.

1125
00:48:42,517 --> 00:48:43,792
Oh.

1126
00:48:43,793 --> 00:48:45,131
Oh.

1127
00:48:45,132 --> 00:48:46,469
Ooh.

1128
00:48:50,607 --> 00:48:53,311
Oh. Wow.

1129
00:48:54,678 --> 00:48:56,012
Oh, my god.

1130
00:48:56,013 --> 00:48:57,581
I'm sorry! I'm leaving!
I'm leaving!

1131
00:48:57,582 --> 00:48:59,617
Sorry! Don't stop!
I'm leaving.

1132
00:48:59,618 --> 00:49:01,018
Oh, my shoe.

1133
00:49:01,019 --> 00:49:02,153
Sorry.

1134
00:49:06,690 --> 00:49:08,091
- So?
- I don't know, kid.

1135
00:49:08,092 --> 00:49:09,659
This lease
doesn't look so hot to me.

1136
00:49:09,660 --> 00:49:12,429
Three-Month security deposit.
You must really love this place.

1137
00:49:12,430 --> 00:49:13,897
No, it's horrible.

1138
00:49:13,898 --> 00:49:16,332
But I can get in this week.

1139
00:49:16,333 --> 00:49:18,735
Well, if I were you,
I'd keep looking.

1140
00:49:18,736 --> 00:49:20,036
- Okay.
- Hey, Lewis.

1141
00:49:20,037 --> 00:49:22,204
What's up?
I've never seen you so awake.

1142
00:49:22,205 --> 00:49:25,175
I was just asked to deliver
this huge order to tribeca,

1143
00:49:25,176 --> 00:49:26,942
And I think
it's to jay Z's apartment.

1144
00:49:26,943 --> 00:49:28,577
I'm not kidding.
Look, it says, "S.Carter."

1145
00:49:28,578 --> 00:49:30,881
- I'm a little freaked out.
- I don't know who that is,

1146
00:49:30,882 --> 00:49:32,549
But is this
someone you want to impress?

1147
00:49:32,550 --> 00:49:34,217
This is a genius, Ben.

1148
00:49:34,218 --> 00:49:37,286
- Whoa, what if Beyoncé opens the door?
- Oh, my god.

1149
00:49:37,287 --> 00:49:39,021
Okay, now I know
who you're talking about.

1150
00:49:39,022 --> 00:49:41,625
Well, maybe you should put on
a proper shirt with a collar.

1151
00:49:41,626 --> 00:49:43,393
A collar?
These are hip-Hop people.

1152
00:49:43,394 --> 00:49:45,863
Dress to impress, Lewis.
Go to the rack.

1153
00:49:45,864 --> 00:49:47,429
Find a boyfriend shirt
that fits.

1154
00:49:47,430 --> 00:49:50,067
Bring the hair down if you can.
Tuck in the shirt.

1155
00:49:50,068 --> 00:49:51,902
Why doesn't anybody
tuck anything in anymore?

1156
00:49:51,903 --> 00:49:53,370
Oh, I'm asking you.

1157
00:49:53,371 --> 00:49:55,005
Okay, okay.

1158
00:49:55,006 --> 00:49:56,639
Benjamin...

1159
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:58,174
we made some progress.

1160
00:49:58,175 --> 00:49:59,910
Very big day
for the intern team.

1161
00:49:59,911 --> 00:50:01,043
It was great.

1162
00:50:01,044 --> 00:50:02,361
I mean, she yelled at me, but...

1163
00:50:02,362 --> 00:50:03,680
She yells at me
all the time, too.

1164
00:50:03,681 --> 00:50:04,931
Right?
It was communication.

1165
00:50:04,932 --> 00:50:06,183
- Yeah.
- It was a breakthrough.

1166
00:50:06,184 --> 00:50:07,216
Yeah.

1167
00:50:07,217 --> 00:50:08,986
Whoo!
Oh, you want one too?

1168
00:50:08,987 --> 00:50:10,486
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1169
00:50:10,487 --> 00:50:13,290
Okay, boys. I'm possibly
meeting jay Z and/or Beyoncé,

1170
00:50:13,291 --> 00:50:14,323
And I'm in a blouse.

1171
00:50:14,324 --> 00:50:16,660
Wear it, dude.
It's an improvement.

1172
00:50:16,661 --> 00:50:17,878
Not true.

1173
00:50:17,879 --> 00:50:19,096
Big one.

1174
00:50:53,196 --> 00:50:55,965
- I hate eating alone.
- So do I.

1175
00:50:55,966 --> 00:50:57,901
You know, you don't actually
have to keep doing that.

1176
00:50:57,902 --> 00:51:00,170
Oh, force of habit.

1177
00:51:00,171 --> 00:51:01,136
Here you go.

1178
00:51:01,137 --> 00:51:02,372
Swiped these
from the tech fridge.

1179
00:51:02,373 --> 00:51:03,957
Oh, nice going.

1180
00:51:03,958 --> 00:51:05,701
You want a slice?

1181
00:51:05,702 --> 00:51:07,445
Sure, thanks.

1182
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:10,931
Cheers.

1183
00:51:10,932 --> 00:51:12,183
Cheers.

1184
00:51:17,754 --> 00:51:19,855
I noticed a couple hours ago,

1185
00:51:19,856 --> 00:51:22,226
You had a meeting
with another possible CEO.

1186
00:51:22,227 --> 00:51:24,661
I saw him arrive.
How'd that go?

1187
00:51:24,662 --> 00:51:26,329
It was going well...

1188
00:51:26,330 --> 00:51:27,997
until he called us...

1189
00:51:27,998 --> 00:51:31,184
I believe the term he used
was a "chick site."

1190
00:51:31,185 --> 00:51:34,370
And I didn't hear
anything he said after that.

1191
00:51:34,371 --> 00:51:37,307
Apparently, selling clothes
makes us a "chick site."

1192
00:51:37,308 --> 00:51:38,440
I mean, really?

1193
00:51:38,441 --> 00:51:39,842
How is this not legit?

1194
00:51:39,843 --> 00:51:42,646
I couldn't agree more.
I find that surprising.

1195
00:51:42,647 --> 00:51:45,149
Really?
Sexism in business?

1196
00:51:47,351 --> 00:51:49,051
So...

1197
00:51:49,052 --> 00:51:51,488
what did you do for work, Ben,
before you retired?

1198
00:51:51,489 --> 00:51:53,891
I was a V.P.
For dex one.

1199
00:51:53,892 --> 00:51:55,024
Phonebooks?

1200
00:51:55,025 --> 00:51:57,093
Yeah.
I was in charge of printing,

1201
00:51:57,094 --> 00:51:59,563
And before that I ran
sales and advertising.

1202
00:51:59,564 --> 00:52:01,365
Big jobs.

1203
00:52:03,333 --> 00:52:05,970
Wasn't this a factory
that used to make phonebooks?

1204
00:52:10,807 --> 00:52:11,874
No. What?

1205
00:52:11,875 --> 00:52:13,910
- Yeah.
- What?

1206
00:52:13,911 --> 00:52:16,780
This is where you worked?

1207
00:52:16,781 --> 00:52:19,150
For almost 40 years.

1208
00:52:21,619 --> 00:52:22,986
Yeah.

1209
00:52:22,987 --> 00:52:25,756
For twenty-Some years
I sat right by that window.

1210
00:52:25,757 --> 00:52:27,857
That was my office.

1211
00:52:27,858 --> 00:52:31,026
It was a few steps up back then.

1212
00:52:31,027 --> 00:52:33,179
We'd look out
over the whole factory.

1213
00:52:33,180 --> 00:52:35,323
Our printing presses
were in that corner.

1214
00:52:35,324 --> 00:52:37,467
That's why the floor dips
back there.

1215
00:52:37,468 --> 00:52:38,968
No way.

1216
00:52:38,969 --> 00:52:40,771
I know everything
about this building.

1217
00:52:40,772 --> 00:52:42,271
Or used to.

1218
00:52:42,272 --> 00:52:44,241
You know the sycamores on
the other side of the building?

1219
00:52:44,242 --> 00:52:45,374
- Yeah.
- The big ones?

1220
00:52:45,375 --> 00:52:46,909
Yeah. The big ones.
I love them.

1221
00:52:46,910 --> 00:52:49,346
Yeah. I remember
the day they were planted.

1222
00:52:51,949 --> 00:52:54,585
Is it totally weird
being back here?

1223
00:52:54,586 --> 00:52:57,371
Well, it feels like home.

1224
00:52:57,372 --> 00:53:00,157
It's... remodeled, but...

1225
00:53:00,158 --> 00:53:01,392
home.

1226
00:53:06,229 --> 00:53:08,131
So you're on facebook, huh?

1227
00:53:08,132 --> 00:53:09,733
Well, I've been trying to
figure it out.

1228
00:53:09,734 --> 00:53:11,100
I joined about 10 minutes ago.

1229
00:53:11,101 --> 00:53:13,537
Well, better late than never.

1230
00:53:13,538 --> 00:53:14,870
You want some help?

1231
00:53:14,871 --> 00:53:17,941
I'd love some, but, really,
you've got better things to do.

1232
00:53:17,942 --> 00:53:20,411
No, I need a diversion.

1233
00:53:21,978 --> 00:53:23,313
You have a photo of yourself?

1234
00:53:23,314 --> 00:53:25,565
- No. I need one?
- If you want to look up

1235
00:53:25,566 --> 00:53:27,818
All those hotties
from high school, you do.

1236
00:53:27,819 --> 00:53:29,085
- Say cheese.
- Cheese.

1237
00:53:31,872 --> 00:53:33,388
That's cute.

1238
00:53:33,389 --> 00:53:36,594
Okay,
I just need to send that to you.

1239
00:53:37,594 --> 00:53:39,161
Uh, all right.

1240
00:53:39,162 --> 00:53:40,998
So there are all these questions
for your profile

1241
00:53:40,999 --> 00:53:43,850
That you can answer
if you want to or not.

1242
00:53:43,851 --> 00:53:46,703
Like religious views,
political views...

1243
00:53:46,704 --> 00:53:48,739
people who inspire you...

1244
00:53:48,740 --> 00:53:51,040
Jules Ostin.

1245
00:53:51,041 --> 00:53:52,374
I'm not trying to brownnose you,

1246
00:53:52,375 --> 00:53:54,276
But I've been in business
a long time,

1247
00:53:54,277 --> 00:53:57,181
And I've never run across
anyone quite like you.

1248
00:53:57,182 --> 00:53:58,547
You do inspire, Jules.

1249
00:53:58,548 --> 00:54:00,049
I just knew,
at the end of the day,

1250
00:54:00,050 --> 00:54:01,551
That a woman
with a glass of wine

1251
00:54:01,552 --> 00:54:04,020
And a laptop
had real shopping potential.

1252
00:54:04,021 --> 00:54:06,824
And if you could actually
promise her things would fit...

1253
00:54:06,825 --> 00:54:07,925
see?
That's what I mean.

1254
00:54:07,926 --> 00:54:09,491
Okay.

1255
00:54:09,492 --> 00:54:11,962
Mm.
You have a favorite quote?

1256
00:54:11,963 --> 00:54:13,395
I do.

1257
00:54:13,396 --> 00:54:15,432
"You're never wrong
to do the right thing."

1258
00:54:15,433 --> 00:54:17,533
- Who said that, you?
- Yeah.

1259
00:54:17,534 --> 00:54:20,837
But I'm pretty sure
mark twain said it first.

1260
00:54:22,939 --> 00:54:24,307
Okay, favorite music?

1261
00:54:24,308 --> 00:54:27,444
Uh, geez. Sam Cooke,
one of my all-Time favorites.

1262
00:54:27,445 --> 00:54:29,913
Love miles Davis,
Billie holiday.

1263
00:54:29,914 --> 00:54:31,581
Oh, she was great, right?

1264
00:54:31,582 --> 00:54:33,751
I mean, she could just, like...

1265
00:54:33,752 --> 00:54:35,920
- transport you.
- Oh, yeah.

1266
00:54:36,887 --> 00:54:39,221
Okay, books?

1267
00:54:39,222 --> 00:54:41,891
Love Clancy, Ludlum.

1268
00:54:41,892 --> 00:54:43,526
Crazy about
"harry potter."

1269
00:54:43,527 --> 00:54:45,545
- Matt loves "harry potter," too.
- Oh, yeah?

1270
00:54:45,546 --> 00:54:47,564
Yeah, like, read them all
the week they came out.

1271
00:54:47,565 --> 00:54:51,100
Wow. Me, too.

1272
00:54:51,101 --> 00:54:53,603
Um, okay, what's
your relationship status?

1273
00:54:53,604 --> 00:54:55,906
Are you married?

1274
00:54:55,907 --> 00:54:57,941
Single?

1275
00:54:57,942 --> 00:54:59,993
Widower.

1276
00:54:59,994 --> 00:55:02,046
I'm sorry.

1277
00:55:04,681 --> 00:55:07,751
I think we should just
say single, then?

1278
00:55:07,752 --> 00:55:10,386
Yeah.

1279
00:55:10,387 --> 00:55:13,791
Okay, do you know
what you need now?

1280
00:55:13,792 --> 00:55:15,959
You need someone to friend.

1281
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:17,760
I'll be friends
with the other interns.

1282
00:55:17,761 --> 00:55:19,563
They'll show me how to do it
in the morning.

1283
00:55:19,564 --> 00:55:21,931
Well, you...
You can friend me.

1284
00:55:21,932 --> 00:55:23,533
Okay, thank you.

1285
00:55:23,534 --> 00:55:24,601
Okay.

1286
00:55:28,004 --> 00:55:29,705
Okay.
Congratulations.

1287
00:55:29,706 --> 00:55:32,408
You are now officially part
of the facebook generation.

1288
00:55:32,409 --> 00:55:35,278
Good deal.

1289
00:55:35,279 --> 00:55:37,347
- Um, you done?
- Yes, thank you.

1290
00:55:37,348 --> 00:55:38,580
Okay.

1291
00:55:38,581 --> 00:55:41,518
Well, I have, uh,
about another hour of work.

1292
00:55:41,519 --> 00:55:43,186
You...
You okay with that?

1293
00:55:43,187 --> 00:55:44,722
Of course.

1294
00:55:45,956 --> 00:55:47,624
This was great, Jules.

1295
00:55:47,625 --> 00:55:49,391
Yeah.

1296
00:55:49,392 --> 00:55:54,164
It was nice to have an adult
conversation with an adult man,

1297
00:55:54,165 --> 00:55:57,467
You know what I mean?
Like, not about work.

1298
00:55:57,468 --> 00:55:59,802
Not about...

1299
00:55:59,803 --> 00:56:01,938
I know what you mean.

1300
00:56:29,265 --> 00:56:31,435
Oh, we're here?

1301
00:56:31,436 --> 00:56:32,535
Yeah.

1302
00:56:32,536 --> 00:56:33,469
Was I snoring?

1303
00:56:33,470 --> 00:56:35,571
- No, no, no. Just sleeping.
- Sorry.

1304
00:56:37,507 --> 00:56:39,408
My parents
are sleep researchers,

1305
00:56:39,409 --> 00:56:41,311
And they've been studying
my sleep my whole life.

1306
00:56:41,312 --> 00:56:44,014
Apparently,
I'm a classic noisy sleeper.

1307
00:56:44,015 --> 00:56:45,515
Fun getting to know me, huh?

1308
00:56:45,516 --> 00:56:47,551
It is.

1309
00:56:49,786 --> 00:56:54,291
I never fall asleep in the car,
so that was actually amazing.

1310
00:56:54,292 --> 00:56:55,725
Apologize for the racket.

1311
00:56:55,726 --> 00:56:57,560
Barely noticed.

1312
00:56:57,561 --> 00:57:00,697
I'll pretend I believe you.

1313
00:57:02,299 --> 00:57:04,433
I love this house.

1314
00:57:04,434 --> 00:57:06,635
It just looks happy to me.

1315
00:57:06,636 --> 00:57:08,504
Like, if it was in a kid's book,

1316
00:57:08,505 --> 00:57:12,041
It would make you feel good when
you turned the page and saw it.

1317
00:57:12,042 --> 00:57:13,477
You know what I mean?

1318
00:57:13,478 --> 00:57:15,562
I do.

1319
00:57:15,563 --> 00:57:17,648
Well...

1320
00:57:20,984 --> 00:57:22,819
sayonara.

1321
00:57:22,820 --> 00:57:24,655
Sayonara.

1322
00:57:35,299 --> 00:57:38,902
I didn't hear you come in.

1323
00:57:38,903 --> 00:57:40,936
You know...

1324
00:57:40,937 --> 00:57:44,106
I was thinking...

1325
00:57:44,107 --> 00:57:46,877
we need
some awake time together.

1326
00:57:58,388 --> 00:58:01,591
Yeah, that, too.

1327
00:58:26,650 --> 00:58:27,650
Morning.

1328
00:58:27,651 --> 00:58:29,684
Good morning.
I'm Doris.

1329
00:58:29,685 --> 00:58:31,287
They asked me
to drive you today.

1330
00:58:31,288 --> 00:58:32,421
Are you all set back there?

1331
00:58:32,422 --> 00:58:33,890
You got your seat belt fastened?

1332
00:58:33,891 --> 00:58:34,641
What happened to Ben?

1333
00:58:35,392 --> 00:58:38,961
Oh, somebody said
that he got transferred.

1334
00:58:38,962 --> 00:58:43,166
Um, you know the best way
to get back to headquarters?

1335
00:58:44,435 --> 00:58:45,785
- Oh!
- Oh, my!

1336
00:58:46,462 --> 00:58:47,136
Oh, what...

1337
00:58:47,137 --> 00:58:50,407
- Come on!
- Hold your horses, maniac!

1338
00:58:51,607 --> 00:58:53,876
Which way, hon?

1339
00:58:53,877 --> 00:58:55,311
- I'm all turned around here.
- Doris.

1340
00:58:55,312 --> 00:58:57,113
- Doris! Doris!
- What? What?!

1341
00:58:57,114 --> 00:58:58,914
You told me to transfer him.

1342
00:58:58,915 --> 00:59:01,684
That was two days ago.
Why didn't you check with me?

1343
00:59:01,685 --> 00:59:04,153
First of all,
that was yesterday.

1344
00:59:04,154 --> 00:59:06,506
Well, where is he?
Do you know?

1345
00:59:11,194 --> 00:59:12,829
Thank you.

1346
00:59:17,533 --> 00:59:19,534
You must think I'm demented.

1347
00:59:19,535 --> 00:59:21,536
Not the word I would use,

1348
00:59:21,537 --> 00:59:24,273
But I was a little surprised
when I got the call.

1349
00:59:24,274 --> 00:59:27,010
Jules, I apologize
if I overstepped in some way.

1350
00:59:27,011 --> 00:59:29,212
No. No, no, no.
No, please don't apologize.

1351
00:59:29,213 --> 00:59:30,879
You have done nothing wrong.

1352
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:34,751
Look, I have a lot going on,
and I'm a very private person.

1353
00:59:34,752 --> 00:59:36,319
And at first, I don't know,
I thought

1354
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:38,422
Maybe this wasn't gonna work,
but I was wrong.

1355
00:59:38,423 --> 00:59:39,990
Let me get one of those.

1356
00:59:39,991 --> 00:59:41,257
- No, no, no.
- No.

1357
00:59:41,258 --> 00:59:42,958
Jules, no explanation necessary.
Please.

1358
00:59:42,959 --> 00:59:47,096
No, actually, one is because
I am usually better than this.

1359
00:59:48,865 --> 00:59:51,600
The truth is...

1360
00:59:51,601 --> 00:59:53,034
something about you
makes me feel calm

1361
00:59:53,035 --> 00:59:57,140
Or more centered or something,
and I-I could use that.

1362
00:59:57,141 --> 00:59:59,608
Obviously.

1363
00:59:59,609 --> 01:00:03,346
I hope you'll accept my apology
and come back to work for me.

1364
01:00:03,347 --> 01:00:05,047
If you want.

1365
01:00:05,048 --> 01:00:06,214
And I'm not just saying this

1366
01:00:06,215 --> 01:00:07,483
Because
I screwed up this morning.

1367
01:00:07,484 --> 01:00:09,418
But I was thinking that

1368
01:00:09,419 --> 01:00:12,121
I'd like to bring you up to
my area, next to Becky.

1369
01:00:12,122 --> 01:00:15,859
I know you can handle more work.
If you'd like more. I...

1370
01:00:15,860 --> 01:00:17,477
oh, god, I can't tell you
how much I hate

1371
01:00:17,478 --> 01:00:19,604
That I jumped the gun
and I made you feel...

1372
01:00:19,605 --> 01:00:21,731
I'm coming back.
I-I'm happy to come back.

1373
01:00:21,732 --> 01:00:23,532
Excellent.

1374
01:00:23,533 --> 01:00:25,569
Can I give you a lift
back to the office?

1375
01:00:25,570 --> 01:00:27,003
Sure, thanks.
Can I take this?

1376
01:00:27,004 --> 01:00:28,804
No.

1377
01:00:30,340 --> 01:00:31,874
Actually, do you mind driving?

1378
01:00:31,875 --> 01:00:34,478
I don't technically
have a license.

1379
01:00:34,479 --> 01:00:35,479
Sure.

1380
01:00:39,448 --> 01:00:40,883
This is...
This is crazy, Ben.

1381
01:00:40,884 --> 01:00:42,351
Two desks
are not gonna fit in here.

1382
01:00:42,352 --> 01:00:43,819
No, I promise
I'll stay out of your way.

1383
01:00:43,820 --> 01:00:46,022
But it's impossible because
now I don't have room for...

1384
01:00:46,023 --> 01:00:47,189
- Hi.
- Hi.

1385
01:00:47,190 --> 01:00:48,574
This is good, right?

1386
01:00:48,575 --> 01:00:49,958
I like this arrangement.

1387
01:00:49,959 --> 01:00:52,428
Uh, Becky, I want you to let Ben
give you a hand, okay?

1388
01:00:52,429 --> 01:00:53,863
And cc him
on all my e-Mails?

1389
01:00:53,864 --> 01:00:56,399
Did we get yesterday's numbers?

1390
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:58,935
Uh, yes, we did.
I saw them here...

1391
01:01:01,404 --> 01:01:03,072
- here you go.
- Thanks.

1392
01:01:03,073 --> 01:01:05,374
And I need to go over the data
on customer purchase patterns.

1393
01:01:05,375 --> 01:01:06,775
Let Ben take a look
at that, too.

1394
01:01:06,776 --> 01:01:08,879
Actually, let Ben
take a look at that first.

1395
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:09,911
Okay.

1396
01:01:09,912 --> 01:01:11,881
Don't worry, Becky.
Backup's good.

1397
01:01:11,882 --> 01:01:13,750
Ping me when Cameron gets in?

1398
01:01:29,832 --> 01:01:31,435
Hey.

1399
01:01:32,936 --> 01:01:34,203
Becky?

1400
01:01:34,204 --> 01:01:36,606
I've been here nine months, Ben,
and she's never asked me

1401
01:01:36,607 --> 01:01:39,776
To take a look at anything
for her ever, okay?

1402
01:01:39,777 --> 01:01:41,510
I hear you.
That's frustrating.

1403
01:01:41,511 --> 01:01:43,646
I mean, totally.
I graduated from Penn.

1404
01:01:43,647 --> 01:01:45,080
I have a business degree.

1405
01:01:45,081 --> 01:01:47,782
But I never seem to do
anything right around here.

1406
01:01:47,783 --> 01:01:51,788
And you're like 50 years older
than me and you're deaf.

1407
01:01:51,789 --> 01:01:54,825
I happen to think you do
a lot of things right.

1408
01:01:55,458 --> 01:01:59,028
You do so much.

1409
01:01:59,029 --> 01:02:01,129
I know.
I know that.

1410
01:02:01,130 --> 01:02:02,565
- Mm-Hmm.
- But she doesn't.

1411
01:02:02,566 --> 01:02:06,569
I mean, I bust my ass for her
14 hours a day,

1412
01:02:06,570 --> 01:02:08,604
And she never notices.

1413
01:02:08,605 --> 01:02:10,839
Oh. Oh, my god.

1414
01:02:10,840 --> 01:02:13,943
I hate girls who cry at work.

1415
01:02:13,944 --> 01:02:16,212
How 'bout if you,
just as an experiment,

1416
01:02:16,213 --> 01:02:17,513
Try letting me help you.

1417
01:02:17,514 --> 01:02:19,014
A lot of your stress
is gonna be lifted

1418
01:02:19,015 --> 01:02:20,949
Once you're out from under
this mountain of worry.

1419
01:02:20,950 --> 01:02:23,486
And maybe you should consider
leaving here at a normal hour

1420
01:02:23,487 --> 01:02:24,687
Once in a while.

1421
01:02:24,688 --> 01:02:26,155
See your friends.
Have a little fun.

1422
01:02:26,156 --> 01:02:29,726
Mm-Hmm. I can offer
my assistance in this area.

1423
01:02:29,727 --> 01:02:33,295
I would love to, actually.

1424
01:02:33,296 --> 01:02:37,500
I just don't want her to think
that I can't do my job

1425
01:02:37,501 --> 01:02:39,234
And I need an intern to help me.

1426
01:02:39,235 --> 01:02:41,337
Okay, you're not gonna
want to hear this,

1427
01:02:41,338 --> 01:02:44,640
But I heard women who sleep
less than seven hours a night

1428
01:02:44,641 --> 01:02:46,208
Gain 38% more weight

1429
01:02:46,209 --> 01:02:48,979
Than women who sleep
more than seven hours a night.

1430
01:02:48,980 --> 01:02:50,579
What?!

1431
01:02:50,580 --> 01:02:52,214
I leave here at 11:00.
I get back at 7:00.

1432
01:02:52,215 --> 01:02:56,218
I sleep like five hours a night,
and now I'm gonna get fat?

1433
01:02:56,219 --> 01:02:58,521
Let's get through this stuff.
Let's do it together.

1434
01:02:58,522 --> 01:02:59,906
Let's clean-Slate it.

1435
01:02:59,907 --> 01:03:01,290
Let's just do it.

1436
01:03:01,291 --> 01:03:03,325
- Yes!
- Very nice, St. Louis.

1437
01:03:03,326 --> 01:03:05,929
- Ah, suede jacket in D.C.
- I cannot believe how well that sweater is doing.

1438
01:03:05,930 --> 01:03:07,262
I'm so happy.

1439
01:03:07,263 --> 01:03:09,965
- Beautiful, Miami! Thank you.
- Oh! Look at Chicago!

1440
01:03:09,966 --> 01:03:11,935
She put the same boots in her
cart as the woman from Houston.

1441
01:03:11,936 --> 01:03:13,837
Okay, let's see
what she does at checkout.

1442
01:03:15,338 --> 01:03:17,138
She's not buying them either.

1443
01:03:17,139 --> 01:03:19,175
Okay, maybe check the
delivery cost on those boots?

1444
01:03:19,176 --> 01:03:20,176
Mm-Hmm.

1445
01:03:21,411 --> 01:03:22,844
- Knock-Knock.
- Hey.

1446
01:03:22,845 --> 01:03:25,348
Hi. I took a look
at the data purchase patterns.

1447
01:03:25,349 --> 01:03:26,982
Uh, should I come back?

1448
01:03:26,983 --> 01:03:28,851
No, no, come on in.
That was fast.

1449
01:03:28,852 --> 01:03:30,719
Well, I enlisted Becky's help.

1450
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:33,455
It seems the most expensive
place you're advertising

1451
01:03:33,456 --> 01:03:36,559
Is actually bringing you the
customers who are spending the least.

1452
01:03:36,560 --> 01:03:38,627
And the channels
you're least investing in

1453
01:03:38,628 --> 01:03:41,931
Are adding enormous value in segments
that currently appear to have low value

1454
01:03:41,932 --> 01:03:44,967
But actually have
the highest spending potential.

1455
01:03:44,968 --> 01:03:48,269
That's what I could tell so far.

1456
01:03:48,270 --> 01:03:50,807
Oh, Ben. Can you, like,
deal with that for me?

1457
01:03:50,808 --> 01:03:52,175
Maybe come up with
a better plan?

1458
01:03:52,176 --> 01:03:53,543
I mean, if you have the time?

1459
01:03:53,544 --> 01:03:55,078
Happy to.

1460
01:03:56,045 --> 01:03:58,247
The man spent 40 years
in business.

1461
01:03:58,248 --> 01:03:59,481
Yeah, no, I get it.

1462
01:03:59,482 --> 01:04:01,400
And, Jules, Becky
was a huge help in this.

1463
01:04:01,401 --> 01:04:03,319
You know she has
a business degree from Penn?

1464
01:04:03,320 --> 01:04:04,719
I know.

1465
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:07,524
I mean, I forgot, but I know.

1466
01:04:11,661 --> 01:04:13,479
I'll say something to her.

1467
01:04:13,480 --> 01:04:15,297
That would be very nice.

1468
01:04:15,298 --> 01:04:17,968
Hey. How's it goin' up here
in first-Class?

1469
01:04:17,969 --> 01:04:20,403
Busy. I see
you found an apartment.

1470
01:04:20,404 --> 01:04:21,503
No.

1471
01:04:21,504 --> 01:04:22,705
My two weeks are up.

1472
01:04:22,706 --> 01:04:24,173
I'm movin' in with my cousin.

1473
01:04:24,174 --> 01:04:25,140
Excellent.

1474
01:04:25,141 --> 01:04:26,475
In Philadelphia.

1475
01:04:26,476 --> 01:04:27,809
- Davis.
- What?

1476
01:04:27,810 --> 01:04:29,746
I'll get there by 11:00,
leave at 5:00.

1477
01:04:29,747 --> 01:04:31,279
It's cool.
I can handle it.

1478
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:34,417
You know, I feel like
everybody's uncle around here.

1479
01:04:34,418 --> 01:04:35,617
Yeah, why is that?

1480
01:04:35,618 --> 01:04:36,886
Because I'm gonna save your ass,

1481
01:04:36,887 --> 01:04:38,955
And I'm gonna put you up
for a few weeks.

1482
01:04:38,956 --> 01:04:39,754
Obviously.

1483
01:04:39,755 --> 01:04:41,156
Ben, thank you.

1484
01:04:41,157 --> 01:04:42,859
Mwah!
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

1485
01:04:42,860 --> 01:04:44,961
Okay. Okay.
Easy, fella.

1486
01:04:48,131 --> 01:04:50,400
I like that you do
the throw pillow thing.

1487
01:04:50,401 --> 01:04:52,602
I was married
for a very long time.

1488
01:04:52,603 --> 01:04:54,669
Mm.

1489
01:04:54,670 --> 01:04:57,706
Whoa.
Is this your closet?

1490
01:04:57,707 --> 01:05:00,609
Busy man about town.

1491
01:05:00,610 --> 01:05:02,177
What's in all these drawers?

1492
01:05:02,178 --> 01:05:04,663
Boxers, t-Shirts,
pocket squares, handkerchiefs.

1493
01:05:04,664 --> 01:05:07,150
Okay, what's the deal
with the handkerchief?

1494
01:05:07,151 --> 01:05:08,751
That one
I just don't get at all.

1495
01:05:08,752 --> 01:05:10,119
Okay. It's essential.

1496
01:05:10,120 --> 01:05:12,755
That your generation
doesn't know that is criminal.

1497
01:05:12,756 --> 01:05:15,391
The best reason to carry
a handkerchief is to lend it.

1498
01:05:15,392 --> 01:05:16,943
Ask Jason about this.

1499
01:05:16,944 --> 01:05:18,386
Women cry, Davis.

1500
01:05:18,387 --> 01:05:19,828
We carry it for them.

1501
01:05:19,829 --> 01:05:22,264
One of the last vestiges
of the chivalrous gent.

1502
01:05:22,265 --> 01:05:24,133
Oh. Well, then
it's different than a po...

1503
01:05:24,134 --> 01:05:25,701
I know you want to hang,
but I...

1504
01:05:25,702 --> 01:05:28,170
I have to get some sleep, kid.
I'm pooped.

1505
01:05:28,171 --> 01:05:29,339
Good night, Ben.

1506
01:05:30,639 --> 01:05:32,208
Thanks again.

1507
01:05:34,043 --> 01:05:36,946
Will you wake me in the morning
or is that too much to ask?

1508
01:05:36,947 --> 01:05:38,814
- My parents always...
- Too much.

1509
01:05:38,815 --> 01:05:41,450
Understood. I'll just
set an alarm on my phone.

1510
01:05:41,451 --> 01:05:44,087
I hope I can hear it.
I'm such a deep sleeper.

1511
01:05:44,088 --> 01:05:46,088
Oh, my god.
I'll wake you.

1512
01:05:46,089 --> 01:05:47,389
Thank you!

1513
01:05:47,390 --> 01:05:49,724
Love you!
Not kidding!

1514
01:05:49,725 --> 01:05:52,194
I love you, too.
Now go to bed.

1515
01:05:52,195 --> 01:05:54,663
Here's some more berries, guys.

1516
01:05:54,664 --> 01:05:57,400
Ben, can you pour me
more syrup, please?

1517
01:05:57,401 --> 01:05:59,001
Sure can.

1518
01:05:59,002 --> 01:06:00,602
There you go.

1519
01:06:00,603 --> 01:06:02,072
Perfect.
Good job.

1520
01:06:02,073 --> 01:06:03,472
Oh, thanks.

1521
01:06:03,473 --> 01:06:06,375
Oh, boy. Okay, so, this really
big CEO named Townsend,

1522
01:06:06,376 --> 01:06:09,278
The one everyone said would
never be interested in us

1523
01:06:09,279 --> 01:06:10,880
Because we weren't
big enough for him?

1524
01:06:10,881 --> 01:06:12,348
- Yeah?
- Yeah?

1525
01:06:13,816 --> 01:06:16,418
We're like your sister wives.

1526
01:06:16,419 --> 01:06:19,555
Well, we just found out
he's beyond interested.

1527
01:06:19,556 --> 01:06:21,340
Exciting.

1528
01:06:21,341 --> 01:06:22,766
Yeah.

1529
01:06:22,767 --> 01:06:24,192
Maybe.

1530
01:06:24,193 --> 01:06:25,794
Everyone's flipping out
about it,

1531
01:06:25,795 --> 01:06:27,831
But you know
I'm still on the fence at best.

1532
01:06:27,832 --> 01:06:29,198
Anyway, the only thing is,

1533
01:06:29,199 --> 01:06:31,166
I have to go to San Francisco
to meet him.

1534
01:06:31,167 --> 01:06:33,135
- He can't come here.
- When do you have to go?

1535
01:06:33,136 --> 01:06:35,638
The only day he can meet
is next Thursday.

1536
01:06:35,639 --> 01:06:37,005
Do you want to come?

1537
01:06:37,006 --> 01:06:39,475
Maybe we can stay the weekend?

1538
01:06:39,476 --> 01:06:41,945
Oh, that sounds awesome.
Um...

1539
01:06:41,946 --> 01:06:44,513
oh, Thursday I can't.

1540
01:06:44,514 --> 01:06:46,148
Paige is snack leader at school,

1541
01:06:46,149 --> 01:06:47,816
And I'm supposed to be
in the class with her.

1542
01:06:47,817 --> 01:06:49,652
- It's kind of a big deal.
- Right.

1543
01:06:49,653 --> 01:06:51,419
Yeah, it's a really big deal.

1544
01:06:51,420 --> 01:06:53,256
No, I know, sweetie.
I'm sorry. I forgot.

1545
01:06:53,257 --> 01:06:56,159
Uh, maybe Ben could go with you.

1546
01:06:56,160 --> 01:06:58,561
Yeah, that's a good idea.

1547
01:06:58,562 --> 01:07:00,963
Guys, Ben has a life.

1548
01:07:00,964 --> 01:07:02,330
Uh, not really.

1549
01:07:02,331 --> 01:07:04,383
Not one that takes me
to San Francisco.

1550
01:07:04,384 --> 01:07:06,436
If you want the company,
I'd love to go.

1551
01:07:06,437 --> 01:07:08,104
Really?

1552
01:07:08,105 --> 01:07:09,772
Definitely.

1553
01:07:09,773 --> 01:07:11,073
- Guess what, Ben?
- Yes?

1554
01:07:11,074 --> 01:07:13,276
Today, my dad's gonna be Ariel.

1555
01:07:13,277 --> 01:07:14,376
It's his turn.

1556
01:07:14,377 --> 01:07:17,112
- Oh, that's good, right?
- Really good.

1557
01:07:17,113 --> 01:07:19,698
You guys think
finding a CEO is a big deal?

1558
01:07:19,699 --> 01:07:22,285
Here, the big negotiation
is who gets to be Ariel

1559
01:07:22,286 --> 01:07:24,352
When we're playing
"little mermaid."

1560
01:07:24,353 --> 01:07:26,522
And for the record,
it's never been my turn.

1561
01:07:26,523 --> 01:07:27,656
Mnh-mnh.

1562
01:07:27,657 --> 01:07:29,775
So this is huge for me.
I'm excited.

1563
01:07:29,776 --> 01:07:31,894
I get to comb my hair with a fork...

1564
01:07:31,895 --> 01:07:34,197
...play with gadgets
and gizmos aplenty.

1565
01:07:34,198 --> 01:07:35,931
Daddy!

1566
01:07:35,932 --> 01:07:37,298
This is Jules.

1567
01:07:37,299 --> 01:07:39,101
So, guys, how long
till we get it fixed?

1568
01:07:39,102 --> 01:07:41,670
I mean, if you can't zoom in,
you probably won't buy.

1569
01:07:41,671 --> 01:07:44,540
Yeah, the first couple
hours are already down 23%.

1570
01:07:44,541 --> 01:07:45,908
- Oh, boy.
- Okay.

1571
01:07:45,909 --> 01:07:47,744
- I will be there in like...
- Two minutes.

1572
01:07:47,745 --> 01:07:49,912
...Two minutes.
- We're on it.

1573
01:07:49,913 --> 01:07:52,315
Ben, do you have the info
on friends shopping together?

1574
01:07:53,683 --> 01:07:55,049
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

1575
01:07:55,050 --> 01:07:57,186
- This is Jules.
- What's wrong?

1576
01:07:57,187 --> 01:07:58,319
Oh, mom, hi.

1577
01:07:58,320 --> 01:08:00,021
Um, I just found out
that the zoom link...

1578
01:08:00,022 --> 01:08:02,457
Um, the button that you click on
to zoom in on a photo,

1579
01:08:02,458 --> 01:08:04,894
- Isn't working.
- That doesn't sound like such a big deal.

1580
01:08:04,895 --> 01:08:06,528
Well, actually, it is.
Um...

1581
01:08:06,529 --> 01:08:10,366
it's what people use to get
a closer look at what...

1582
01:08:10,367 --> 01:08:11,733
Everybody zooms in.

1583
01:08:11,734 --> 01:08:14,303
I guess I don't go to your
website enough to know that.

1584
01:08:19,892 --> 01:08:21,910
Oh, typing and ringing.

1585
01:08:21,911 --> 01:08:23,412
Yeah, sorry.
Oh, it's the warehouse.

1586
01:08:23,413 --> 01:08:24,914
Mom, I'm sorry.
Can I call you back?

1587
01:08:24,915 --> 01:08:26,615
- No need.
- Okay, love you.

1588
01:08:26,616 --> 01:08:27,782
Yep.

1589
01:08:27,783 --> 01:08:30,619
Who says "yep" to "I love you"?

1590
01:08:35,592 --> 01:08:36,858
Hi, Alonzo.

1591
01:08:36,859 --> 01:08:37,993
Hi, Jules.

1592
01:08:37,994 --> 01:08:39,127
Not good news.

1593
01:08:39,128 --> 01:08:40,729
What? Okay.
Lay it on me.

1594
01:08:40,730 --> 01:08:43,432
In a routine check
by the sanitation department,

1595
01:08:43,433 --> 01:08:45,234
They found one bedbug.

1596
01:08:45,235 --> 01:08:47,035
- No.
- Unfortunately, yes.

1597
01:08:47,036 --> 01:08:49,204
We sent out 4,800 boxes
yesterday.

1598
01:08:49,205 --> 01:08:51,407
We have to get them all back,
shut down the warehouse...

1599
01:08:51,408 --> 01:08:53,092
- ugh.
...spray for bedbugs,

1600
01:08:53,093 --> 01:08:54,777
Then we can start shipping
again.

1601
01:08:54,778 --> 01:08:55,945
- Nightmare.
- Nightmare.

1602
01:08:55,946 --> 01:08:57,111
Okay, here we are.

1603
01:08:57,112 --> 01:08:59,149
Okay,
let me just finish this e-Mail.

1604
01:09:17,667 --> 01:09:19,051
No!

1605
01:09:19,052 --> 01:09:20,435
No.

1606
01:09:20,436 --> 01:09:21,504
No, no, no.

1607
01:09:28,611 --> 01:09:30,595
Hey, guys.
Thanks for coming.

1608
01:09:30,596 --> 01:09:32,580
I know the zoom is broken,

1609
01:09:32,581 --> 01:09:34,049
And I don't mean to
pull anyone off of that,

1610
01:09:34,050 --> 01:09:35,717
But I need a favor.

1611
01:09:35,718 --> 01:09:37,886
I accidentally sent an e-mail
to the wrong person,

1612
01:09:37,887 --> 01:09:39,621
And she's at work right now.

1613
01:09:39,622 --> 01:09:41,223
And I know she doesn't check
her personal e-Mail

1614
01:09:41,224 --> 01:09:42,757
Until she gets home
at 5:30.

1615
01:09:42,758 --> 01:09:44,626
So I have until then
to figure out how to delete it.

1616
01:09:44,627 --> 01:09:47,530
Because if this person sees
this e-Mail, it'll be horrible.

1617
01:09:47,531 --> 01:09:49,832
And on top of that,
she has a minor heart condition.

1618
01:09:49,833 --> 01:09:52,868
I think this could
possibly be not good for that.

1619
01:09:52,869 --> 01:09:55,905
So I am counting on
your good graces and brilliance

1620
01:09:55,906 --> 01:09:58,006
To figure out
a way to save my ass.

1621
01:09:58,007 --> 01:09:59,741
Truthfully, Jules,
it's pretty impossible

1622
01:09:59,742 --> 01:10:01,109
To hack into a server.

1623
01:10:01,110 --> 01:10:02,845
And you don't know her password?

1624
01:10:02,846 --> 01:10:04,245
No idea.

1625
01:10:04,246 --> 01:10:06,415
Jules, I think there's only
one thing we can do.

1626
01:10:06,416 --> 01:10:07,950
What? Tell me.
I'm dying.

1627
01:10:07,951 --> 01:10:09,484
Me and the boys take off,

1628
01:10:09,485 --> 01:10:12,354
We break into your mom's house,
and we steal her computer.

1629
01:10:12,355 --> 01:10:14,890
Break into her house
and steal the computer?

1630
01:10:14,891 --> 01:10:16,359
Are you kidding me?

1631
01:10:17,660 --> 01:10:19,394
That's freaking genius.

1632
01:10:19,395 --> 01:10:22,665
You will reach your destination

1633
01:10:22,666 --> 01:10:24,632
In 300 yards.

1634
01:10:24,633 --> 01:10:27,669
Little does GPS lady know
she is an accomplice to a crime.

1635
01:10:27,670 --> 01:10:30,505
The woman has a heart condition.
Think of it as a good deed.

1636
01:10:30,506 --> 01:10:33,342
I never thought you'd be a bad
influence on me, Whittaker.

1637
01:10:33,343 --> 01:10:35,911
Oh, relax, fellas. This is
gonna be a piece of cake.

1638
01:10:35,912 --> 01:10:37,245
The key is under a flowerpot.

1639
01:10:37,246 --> 01:10:38,914
We go in, we delete,
we disappear.

1640
01:10:38,915 --> 01:10:40,583
She doesn't have an alarm,
right?

1641
01:10:40,584 --> 01:10:41,783
Nope.
She does not.

1642
01:10:41,784 --> 01:10:43,919
What if there's, like,
a password on the e-Mail? Hmm?

1643
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:45,420
Then we take the computer.

1644
01:10:45,421 --> 01:10:48,223
Jules said she'd buy her
a new one, so it's a win-Win.

1645
01:10:48,224 --> 01:10:51,460
You will reach your destination
in 100 yards.

1646
01:10:51,461 --> 01:10:52,961
This is like an "oceans" movie.

1647
01:10:52,962 --> 01:10:54,963
Ben's the old guy
with the big glasses.

1648
01:10:54,964 --> 01:10:56,431
His name is Elliott Gould.

1649
01:10:56,432 --> 01:10:58,633
- Yeah, and, Jason, you're Clooney.
- Thank you.

1650
01:10:58,634 --> 01:11:00,770
And I'll be Matt Damon
'cause I'm kind of an outsider.

1651
01:11:00,771 --> 01:11:02,070
Yeah, definitely.
Who am I?

1652
01:11:02,071 --> 01:11:03,739
Uh, you are
Ben Affleck's brother.

1653
01:11:03,740 --> 01:11:05,274
Well, why aren't I brad Pitt?

1654
01:11:05,275 --> 01:11:08,277
I think that's kind of
self-Explanatory.

1655
01:11:17,953 --> 01:11:19,255
- Okay, Clooney.
- Thank you.

1656
01:11:19,256 --> 01:11:20,656
You're behind the wheel.

1657
01:11:20,657 --> 01:11:21,924
Park on the street.

1658
01:11:21,925 --> 01:11:24,142
Keep the engine running,
your eyes open.

1659
01:11:24,143 --> 01:11:26,361
Damon, Affleck's brother,
you're with me.

1660
01:11:26,362 --> 01:11:27,931
All right, let's do this.

1661
01:11:29,299 --> 01:11:32,135
Remember,
the key's under the flowerpot.

1662
01:11:49,686 --> 01:11:50,919
Oh, no.

1663
01:11:50,920 --> 01:11:53,321
Oh, great plan so far.
Oh, my god.

1664
01:11:53,322 --> 01:11:55,156
- Lewis, get Becky.
- If we don't know the code,

1665
01:11:55,157 --> 01:11:56,992
This is gonna turn into an alarm
in 60 seconds.

1666
01:11:56,993 --> 01:11:58,593
Becky, put Jules on.

1667
01:11:58,594 --> 01:12:00,812
She put me on hold.
What is wrong with that girl?

1668
01:12:00,813 --> 01:12:03,032
This is so not good.
What are we supposed to do, Ben?

1669
01:12:03,033 --> 01:12:04,183
- What are we supposed...
- Stop eating!

1670
01:12:04,184 --> 01:12:05,334
- Uh-Huh!
- Go look for the computer!

1671
01:12:05,335 --> 01:12:06,852
Right now!
Go! Go! Go!

1672
01:12:06,853 --> 01:12:08,445
No! Separately!
Separate...

1673
01:12:08,446 --> 01:12:10,038
Ben.
Ben, you there?

1674
01:12:10,039 --> 01:12:12,175
Becky, don't screw around.
Put Jules on. It's an emergency.

1675
01:12:12,176 --> 01:12:14,610
- She's in a meeting.
- Interrupt her.

1676
01:12:14,611 --> 01:12:15,577
Ben, what's up?

1677
01:12:15,578 --> 01:12:17,246
Jules, your mother has an alarm.

1678
01:12:17,247 --> 01:12:18,914
- No, she doesn't.
- Yes, she does.

1679
01:12:18,915 --> 01:12:20,950
I'm in her kitchen. It's about
to go off. What's her code?

1680
01:12:20,951 --> 01:12:22,818
I have no idea.
Ben, listen to me.

1681
01:12:22,819 --> 01:12:24,085
I know this woman.

1682
01:12:24,086 --> 01:12:25,420
That is a fake alarm
that she bought

1683
01:12:25,421 --> 01:12:26,655
Off of some infomercial
or something, okay?

1684
01:12:26,656 --> 01:12:28,157
It's not real.
It's not connected.

1685
01:12:28,158 --> 01:12:29,658
It's just to scare off burglars.

1686
01:12:29,659 --> 01:12:31,394
She says it's fake.
It's just to scare off burglars.

1687
01:12:31,395 --> 01:12:33,227
Oh, well, it's doing a good job.

1688
01:12:33,228 --> 01:12:35,365
Listen, my parents would never
pay for an alarm, okay?

1689
01:12:35,366 --> 01:12:36,831
They're the cheapest people
in America.

1690
01:12:36,832 --> 01:12:39,000
Okay, well, it hasn't
turned into an alarm yet.

1691
01:12:39,001 --> 01:12:40,902
- It's still beeping.
- That's 'cause it's a fake.

1692
01:12:40,903 --> 01:12:42,805
Trust me on this one.
Have you found the computer?

1693
01:12:42,806 --> 01:12:44,106
It's not down here.

1694
01:12:48,711 --> 01:12:50,713
Lewis, go in there.
Davis, in there.

1695
01:12:53,315 --> 01:12:55,616
- Found it!
- Got it! What?

1696
01:12:55,617 --> 01:12:57,586
We found two. Which one is hers?
The white one or the silver one?

1697
01:12:57,587 --> 01:12:59,320
The white one or the silver one?

1698
01:12:59,321 --> 01:13:00,589
The white one or the silver one?
White one or the silver one?

1699
01:13:00,590 --> 01:13:02,057
- Your mom's computer?
- Yes.

1700
01:13:02,058 --> 01:13:03,259
It's white.
I got it fixed for her once.

1701
01:13:03,260 --> 01:13:04,827
- I am positive.
- The white one!

1702
01:13:04,828 --> 01:13:06,362
White.

1703
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:11,732
Oh, my god.

1704
01:13:11,733 --> 01:13:14,303
I knew there was no such thing
as a fake alarm!

1705
01:13:14,304 --> 01:13:16,038
We're gonna get arrested!
I knew it!

1706
01:13:16,039 --> 01:13:17,372
That's it! We're done!

1707
01:13:17,373 --> 01:13:19,274
Our fingerprints
are all over this place!

1708
01:13:19,275 --> 01:13:20,642
Ben,
do you see the e-Mail?

1709
01:13:20,643 --> 01:13:22,778
- Not yet.
- Double-Time it, dude.

1710
01:13:22,779 --> 01:13:24,613
Here, let me.

1711
01:13:24,614 --> 01:13:26,448
Found it!

1712
01:13:26,449 --> 01:13:28,451
"Why is my mother
always such a raging bitch?"

1713
01:13:28,452 --> 01:13:30,352
Subject...
"She's a terrorist."

1714
01:13:30,353 --> 01:13:31,821
Yes! Delete it!

1715
01:13:31,822 --> 01:13:32,920
Gone.

1716
01:13:32,921 --> 01:13:34,290
Now from the trash!

1717
01:13:36,091 --> 01:13:37,158
Got it.

1718
01:13:39,028 --> 01:13:40,128
Davis, where'd you find this?

1719
01:13:40,129 --> 01:13:41,230
Under the bed, right side.

1720
01:13:41,231 --> 01:13:42,663
Which right side?

1721
01:13:42,664 --> 01:13:44,999
Right side facing the bed!
Oh, my god! My life is over!

1722
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,336
I'm gonna be a felon and
I have not committed a crime!

1723
01:13:47,337 --> 01:13:48,603
Davis.
Davis, pull it together.

1724
01:13:48,604 --> 01:13:50,305
Can't you hear
how far away that is?

1725
01:13:50,306 --> 01:13:51,906
We've got at least 30 seconds
until they're here.

1726

01:15:17,543 --> 01:15:19,828
Yeah. But could I just get
a half this time?

1769
01:15:19,829 --> 01:15:20,929

I've worked for you
for like a year.

1776
01:15:32,642 --> 01:15:34,643
I've delivered things
to your home.

1777
01:15:34,644 --> 01:15:35,944
I met Matt a bunch of times.

1778
01:15:35,945 --> 01:15:37,912
I've tied your daughter's shoe
before.

1779
01:15:37,913 --> 01:15:40,049
I... I know who you are.
I'm just terrible with names.

1780
01:15:40,050 --> 01:15:41,784
It's all right.
It's Jason.

1781
01:15:41,785 --> 01:15:42,951
You're new, right?

1782
01:15:42,952 --> 01:15:44,118
Yeah.
I'm Davis.

1783
01:15:44,119 --> 01:15:45,720
I started work
the same day as Ben.

1784
01:15:45,721 --> 01:15:47,855
- We're pretty much besties, and I'm his mentee.
- Oh.

1785
01:15:47,856 --> 01:15:50,059
He gave me this tie,
for example.

1786
01:15:50,060 --> 01:15:51,743
It was his.
It's vintage.

1787
01:15:51,744 --> 01:15:53,428
- "Vintage."
- I like it.

1788
01:15:53,429 --> 01:15:54,763
I like men in ties.

1789
01:15:54,764 --> 01:15:56,664
- And, you're Lewis.
- Yes.

1790
01:15:56,665 --> 01:15:58,367
Yeah, I could hear a little bit
over the phone.

1791
01:15:58,368 --> 01:15:59,834
You were very cool
under pressure.

1792
01:15:59,835 --> 01:16:02,237
Well, it was my first heist.
I tried to be chill.

1793
01:16:02,238 --> 01:16:03,338
Thanks for noticing.

1794
01:16:03,339 --> 01:16:05,140
Salut.

1795
01:16:05,141 --> 01:16:06,274
- Mm!
- Whoo!

1796
01:16:06,275 --> 01:16:08,877
Boys, what can I say...

1797
01:16:08,878 --> 01:16:09,911
I'm sorry.

1798
01:16:09,912 --> 01:16:11,696
I didn't mean
to call you "boys."

1799
01:16:11,697 --> 01:16:13,482
Nobody calls men "men" anymore.

1800
01:16:13,483 --> 01:16:14,749
Have you noticed?

1801
01:16:14,750 --> 01:16:16,351
Women went from "girls"
to "women."

1802
01:16:16,352 --> 01:16:17,785
Men went from "men" to "boys"?

1803
01:16:17,786 --> 01:16:20,289
This is a problem
in the big picture.

1804
01:16:20,290 --> 01:16:22,491
- Do you know what I mean?
- Yeah.

1805
01:16:22,492 --> 01:16:24,025
I'm gonna have another.

1806
01:16:24,026 --> 01:16:25,426
Another?
You sure about that?

1807
01:16:25,427 --> 01:16:27,996
Yep. Okay,
here's my theory about this.

1808
01:16:27,997 --> 01:16:30,766
We all grew up during the "take your
daughter to work day" thing, right?

1809
01:16:30,767 --> 01:16:32,133
Mm-Hmm.

1810
01:16:32,134 --> 01:16:35,437
So we were always told we could
be anything, do anything.

1811
01:16:35,438 --> 01:16:38,340
And I think guys got,
maybe not left behind,

1812
01:16:38,341 --> 01:16:40,040
But not quite as nurtured,
you know?

1813
01:16:40,041 --> 01:16:43,245
I mean, like, we were the
generation of "you go, girl."

1814
01:16:43,246 --> 01:16:45,046
We had Oprah.

1815
01:16:45,047 --> 01:16:47,482
And I wonder sometimes
how guys fit in, you know?

1816
01:16:47,483 --> 01:16:49,919
They still seem to be
trying to figure it out.

1817
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:51,653
They're still dressing
like little boys.

1818
01:16:51,654 --> 01:16:53,371
They're still playing
video games.

1819
01:16:53,372 --> 01:16:55,090
Well, they've gotten great.
So...

1820
01:16:55,091 --> 01:16:56,959
I love video games.

1821
01:16:56,960 --> 01:16:58,459
Oh, boy.

1822
01:16:58,460 --> 01:17:00,695
How, in one generation,
have men gone from

1823
01:17:00,696 --> 01:17:04,700
Guys like jack Nicholson
and Harrison ford to...

1824
01:17:08,270 --> 01:17:10,071
take Ben, here.

1825
01:17:10,072 --> 01:17:11,756
A dying breed.
You know?

1826
01:17:11,757 --> 01:17:13,441
Look and learn, boys,

1827
01:17:13,442 --> 01:17:15,776
Because if you ask me,
this is what cool is.

1828
01:17:15,777 --> 01:17:18,247
Oh, thanks, ace. You're not
gonna drink anymore, right?

1829
01:17:18,248 --> 01:17:20,165
Calling me "ace"?

1830
01:17:20,166 --> 01:17:22,084
That is just super cool, right?

1831
01:17:22,085 --> 01:17:23,384
- Definitely.
- Very cool.

1832
01:17:23,385 --> 01:17:26,188
Okay.
I am officially a little dizzy.

1833
01:17:26,189 --> 01:17:28,023
I apologize for the tirade.

1834
01:17:28,024 --> 01:17:30,558
I am gonna go.

1835
01:17:30,559 --> 01:17:33,978
But I am forever in your debt,
gentlemen.

1836
01:17:33,979 --> 01:17:37,399
Another word
which is never used anymore.

1837
01:17:37,400 --> 01:17:40,135
Let's bring it back, shall we?

1838
01:17:40,136 --> 01:17:42,872
- Yes.
- Ben, I'll be ubering home.

1839
01:17:42,873 --> 01:17:44,373
- Thanks again.
- Whoa! Whoa!

1840
01:17:44,374 --> 01:17:45,406
Okay.

1841
01:17:45,407 --> 01:17:47,843
I'm so sorry.

1842
01:17:47,844 --> 01:17:49,978
Don't worry.

1843
01:17:49,979 --> 01:17:51,947
I'm fine now.

1844
01:17:51,948 --> 01:17:53,915
Okay.

1845
01:17:53,916 --> 01:17:55,350
It's okay, it's okay.

1846
01:17:57,953 --> 01:18:00,923
Oh, I haven't done that
since college.

1847
01:18:04,526 --> 01:18:06,978
Thank you.

1848
01:18:06,979 --> 01:18:09,430
Oh, man.

1849
01:18:09,431 --> 01:18:12,201
Very sorry you had to see that.

1850
01:18:12,202 --> 01:18:13,435
Humiliating.

1851
01:18:13,436 --> 01:18:14,669
It's all good.

1852
01:18:14,670 --> 01:18:16,705
You feeling better?

1853
01:18:16,706 --> 01:18:18,072
Yeah.

1854
01:18:18,073 --> 01:18:21,777
Yeah, I forgot you got to eat
before you drink.

1855
01:18:23,779 --> 01:18:25,647
I'm good now.

1856
01:18:25,648 --> 01:18:27,516
Thank you.

1857
01:18:35,591 --> 01:18:38,192
I'm leaving in a minute.

1858
01:18:38,193 --> 01:18:41,763
Just working on making this
the worst possible day for you.

1859
01:18:41,764 --> 01:18:44,667
No, not at all.
You've had a stressful day.

1860
01:18:48,937 --> 01:18:53,041
How is it that you always
manage to say the right thing...

1861
01:18:53,042 --> 01:18:56,278
do the right thing,
be the right thing?

1862
01:18:56,279 --> 01:18:58,546
It's uncanny.

1863
01:18:58,547 --> 01:19:00,249
You...
You get some rest.

1864
01:19:00,250 --> 01:19:01,548
I will.

1865
01:19:01,549 --> 01:19:03,452
Thanks for everything.

1866
01:19:08,056 --> 01:19:10,559
Oh, and, uh...

1867
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:13,195
sayonara.

1868
01:19:13,196 --> 01:19:15,831
Absolutely.

1869
01:19:29,077 --> 01:19:30,845
Really so nice of you
to do this.

1870
01:19:30,846 --> 01:19:32,614
Most women would have
just rescheduled.

1871
01:19:32,615 --> 01:19:35,451
Oh, not to worry.
I understand.

1872
01:19:35,452 --> 01:19:37,818
It was unexpected.

1873
01:19:37,819 --> 01:19:39,287
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1874
01:19:39,288 --> 01:19:40,723
You're welcome.

1875
01:19:48,163 --> 01:19:50,364
- Hi.
- Oh. Come on in.

1876
01:19:50,365 --> 01:19:52,701
Oh, no, after you.
Go ahead.

1877
01:19:55,104 --> 01:19:57,939
Benji, you brought a date
to a funeral. Unreal.

1878
01:19:57,940 --> 01:20:00,776
We had plans.
Who knew this was gonna happen?

1879
01:20:00,777 --> 01:20:02,911
Well, how do you do?
I'm miles.

1880
01:20:02,912 --> 01:20:04,212
Hello. Fiona.

1881
01:20:04,213 --> 01:20:05,580
I'm so sorry for your loss.

1882
01:20:05,581 --> 01:20:08,584
Oh, thank you, dear.

1883
01:20:08,585 --> 01:20:11,070
Wowza!

1884
01:20:45,154 --> 01:20:47,055
I never went to a Shiva before.

1885
01:20:47,056 --> 01:20:48,956
The laughter was wonderful.

1886
01:20:48,957 --> 01:20:50,725
I don't think
I've ever eaten more.

1887
01:20:50,726 --> 01:20:53,462
I'm not even sure how I left
with a box of cookies.

1888
01:20:53,463 --> 01:20:55,028
Well, you were a big hit.

1889
01:20:55,029 --> 01:20:57,832
Giving the widow that
back massage... Winning move.

1890
01:20:57,833 --> 01:20:59,900
Oh, yeah.
She needed it.

1891
01:20:59,901 --> 01:21:01,736
I definitely think
it's a good idea

1892
01:21:01,737 --> 01:21:03,838
To take all first dates
to a funeral.

1893
01:21:03,839 --> 01:21:05,941
Yeah. A real icebreaker,
don't you think?

1894
01:21:06,942 --> 01:21:08,843
I know you're kidding
but, honestly,

1895
01:21:08,844 --> 01:21:10,744
Who needs the strain
of the dinner date?

1896
01:21:10,745 --> 01:21:13,764
And the "why aren't you
married?" Conversation.

1897
01:21:13,765 --> 01:21:16,785
At our age it's not even
possible to catch up.

1898
01:21:16,786 --> 01:21:19,955
Well, I can do me in 10 seconds.

1899
01:21:21,223 --> 01:21:22,824
- You ready?
- Yep.

1900
01:21:22,825 --> 01:21:25,627
Widower, one son, two grandkids.

1901
01:21:25,628 --> 01:21:27,763
Spent my life
manufacturing phonebooks,

1902
01:21:27,764 --> 01:21:29,197
Which no longer serve a purpose.

1903
01:21:30,199 --> 01:21:32,034
I'm currently working
as an intern,

1904
01:21:32,035 --> 01:21:33,934
Having a ball.

1905
01:21:33,935 --> 01:21:37,939
And the best news is, I have
a crush on a girl I met at work.

1906
01:21:37,940 --> 01:21:41,243
I'm sorry you lost your wife.

1907
01:21:41,244 --> 01:21:42,444
Okay.

1908
01:21:42,445 --> 01:21:43,644
Divorced.

1909
01:21:43,645 --> 01:21:45,145
Three beautiful daughters.

1910
01:21:45,146 --> 01:21:48,116
One grandchild, a boy,
on the way.

1911
01:21:48,117 --> 01:21:49,651
I was sick a few years back.

1912
01:21:49,652 --> 01:21:50,885
I'm not anymore.

1913
01:21:50,886 --> 01:21:53,422
I'm an in-House
e-Commerce masseuse.

1914
01:21:53,423 --> 01:21:54,922
Love my job.

1915
01:21:54,923 --> 01:21:59,628
And I finally met a man I
actually want to hang out with.

1916
01:21:59,629 --> 01:22:01,062
Lucky me.

1917
01:22:17,679 --> 01:22:18,880
Morning.

1918
01:22:18,881 --> 01:22:20,682
Hey, buddy.
You don't look so great.

1919
01:22:20,683 --> 01:22:22,317
Yeah, I know.

1920
01:22:22,318 --> 01:22:25,753
But believe me, I look better than I feel.

1921
01:22:25,754 --> 01:22:26,988
Oh, did you see the Yankees
last night?

1922
01:22:26,989 --> 01:22:29,356
- Oh, they were on fire.
- Oh, man.

1923
01:22:29,357 --> 01:22:31,459
Got to get something
in your stomach.

1924
01:22:31,460 --> 01:22:32,893
Honey, honey, honey.

1925
01:22:32,894 --> 01:22:34,930
Just can you please take
one bite before school?

1926
01:22:34,931 --> 01:22:36,330
Please?
Just one bite?

1927
01:22:36,331 --> 01:22:38,282
Hey, what's with the waterworks,
little one?

1928
01:22:38,283 --> 01:22:40,235
I just told her that
the sitter's gonna have to

1929
01:22:40,236 --> 01:22:41,703
Take her to
Maddie's birthday party

1930
01:22:41,704 --> 01:22:42,970
Because Matt's feeling sick.

1931
01:22:42,971 --> 01:22:46,942
But I don't want to go
with the sitter.

1932
01:22:46,943 --> 01:22:48,076
Ben?

1933
01:22:48,077 --> 01:22:50,412
Can you take me?

1934
01:22:50,413 --> 01:22:51,930
Please?

1935
01:22:51,931 --> 01:22:53,447
Oh, honey?

1936
01:22:53,448 --> 01:22:57,118
I'm so sorry, but Ben's
got to go to work today.

1937
01:22:59,688 --> 01:23:01,556
Jules. Come on.
It'll take an hour.

1938
01:23:01,557 --> 01:23:03,392
Let me take her.

1939
01:23:06,095 --> 01:23:08,130
I... I can't believe
we're still going through this.

1940
01:23:08,131 --> 01:23:11,033
I'm going the right way.
Please have a little trust.

1941
01:23:11,034 --> 01:23:13,201
But the park
where the party is...

1942
01:23:13,202 --> 01:23:14,902
Oh. Sorry, Ben.

1943
01:23:14,903 --> 01:23:17,388
Actually, this is it.

1944
01:23:17,389 --> 01:23:19,873
You're like a clone.

1945
01:23:19,874 --> 01:23:22,878
Oh, boy.
This looks like a nice party.

1946
01:23:22,879 --> 01:23:24,979
Yeah, it does.

1947
01:23:24,980 --> 01:23:26,864
So which one is Maddie?

1948
01:23:26,865 --> 01:23:28,749
The one in the pink.

1949
01:23:28,750 --> 01:23:31,253
Okay.
The one in the pink.

1950
01:23:32,921 --> 01:23:35,322
You can go sit with
the other moms, okay?

1951
01:23:35,323 --> 01:23:37,725
Okay. You want to
give Maddie her present?

1952
01:23:37,726 --> 01:23:38,759
Yeah.

1953
01:23:38,760 --> 01:23:40,495
Okay.

1954
01:23:40,496 --> 01:23:42,231
Have fun.

1955
01:23:44,199 --> 01:23:45,300
The other moms.

1956
01:23:46,568 --> 01:23:48,002
Frep... Freprino
or something.

1957
01:23:48,003 --> 01:23:49,638
Yeah, I know.
I don't know any of them.

1958
01:23:49,639 --> 01:23:51,405
Hi. I'm Ben.

1959
01:23:51,406 --> 01:23:52,657
- Hi. Jane.
- Jane.

1960
01:23:52,658 --> 01:23:53,908
- And Emily.
- Hi, Emily.

1961
01:23:53,909 --> 01:23:55,510
I'm helping Matt and Jules out
today.

1962
01:23:55,511 --> 01:23:57,312
Oh, are you Matt's dad?

1963
01:23:57,313 --> 01:23:59,114
No, no.
I work for Jules.

1964
01:23:59,115 --> 01:24:00,347
Oh.

1965
01:24:00,348 --> 01:24:01,916
That's okay?

1966
01:24:01,917 --> 01:24:05,420
I've just heard she's,
you know, kind of tough.

1967
01:24:05,421 --> 01:24:08,055
Tough? Jules? Sure.
She's a total badass.

1968
01:24:08,056 --> 01:24:10,859
I guess that's how she became
an internet sensation.

1969
01:24:10,860 --> 01:24:12,727
Must make you guys proud, huh?

1970
01:24:12,728 --> 01:24:14,128
One of your own out there
every day,

1971
01:24:14,129 --> 01:24:16,265
Crashing the glass ceiling
of the tech world.

1972
01:24:16,266 --> 01:24:19,568
So, bravo, good for her.
Right?

1973
01:24:19,569 --> 01:24:21,286
Y-Yeah.
No, for sure.

1974
01:24:23,006 --> 01:24:24,406
What's up, kiddo?

1975
01:24:24,407 --> 01:24:25,807
I don't feel good.

1976
01:24:25,808 --> 01:24:28,642
You don't?
Do you want to sit on my lap?

1977
01:24:28,643 --> 01:24:32,013
You know, if she's sick
she probably shouldn't be here.

1978
01:24:32,014 --> 01:24:34,983
Tough crowd, Paigey.
You want to hit the road?

1979
01:24:34,984 --> 01:24:36,518
Does that mean "leave"?

1980
01:24:36,519 --> 01:24:37,920
'Fraid so.

1981
01:24:39,587 --> 01:24:45,327
I spy with my little eye
something... blue!

1982
01:24:45,328 --> 01:24:47,462
Is it the car next to us?

1983
01:24:47,463 --> 01:24:48,763
No.

1984
01:24:48,764 --> 01:24:51,499
Is it, um, that dog leash?

1985
01:24:51,500 --> 01:24:53,067
No.

1986
01:24:53,068 --> 01:24:54,885
Um, is it the sky?

1987
01:24:54,886 --> 01:24:56,479
Yes! You got one.

1988
01:24:56,480 --> 01:24:58,073
Your turn, Ben.

1989
01:24:58,074 --> 01:24:59,639
Okay.

1990
01:24:59,640 --> 01:25:01,142
Oh, I have a good one.

1991
01:25:01,143 --> 01:25:04,679
I spy with my little eye
something green.

1992
01:25:04,680 --> 01:25:06,381
Is it that tree?

1993
01:25:06,382 --> 01:25:07,648
Nope.

1994
01:25:07,649 --> 01:25:09,801
Is it that front door?

1995
01:25:09,802 --> 01:25:11,954
Well, it's kind of green.

1996
01:25:27,402 --> 01:25:29,070
Is it, Ben?

1997
01:25:29,071 --> 01:25:31,440
Is it that front door?

1998
01:25:33,975 --> 01:25:36,812
Yeah, it is, honey.
Good girl.

1999
01:26:49,851 --> 01:26:52,087
Thanks so much, Ben.

2000
01:27:07,936 --> 01:27:09,369
Hey, come on in the kitchen.

2001
01:27:09,370 --> 01:27:11,172
Can I get you something
before you hit the road?

2002
01:27:11,173 --> 01:27:13,909
Want a cup of coffee
or a bite to eat?

2003
01:27:13,910 --> 01:27:15,442
Uh, I'm good, thanks.

2004
01:27:15,443 --> 01:27:18,146
Okay. How was she?
She give you any trouble?

2005
01:27:18,147 --> 01:27:19,679
She was perfect.

2006
01:27:19,680 --> 01:27:22,800
She wasn't feeling so great
at the party, so we left early,

2007
01:27:22,801 --> 01:27:25,921
And she just fell asleep in the
car, so I let her get a nap in.

2008
01:27:25,922 --> 01:27:27,589
So nice of you.
Thank you.

2009
01:27:28,825 --> 01:27:30,125
Sorry.

2010
01:27:34,262 --> 01:27:36,264
You seem like
you're feeling more with it.

2011
01:27:36,265 --> 01:27:38,098
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
Um...

2012
01:27:38,099 --> 01:27:40,101
I guess I just needed
a little downtime.

2013
01:27:40,102 --> 01:27:44,039
You know, or maybe I wasn't even
that sick, I don't know.

2014
01:27:44,040 --> 01:27:46,824
Hey, Ben, I got something
I wanted to ask.

2015
01:27:46,825 --> 01:27:49,619
What's your whole take
on the CEO thing?

2016
01:27:49,620 --> 01:27:52,413
I mean, you're more
on the inside than I am.

2017
01:27:52,414 --> 01:27:55,583
I know Jules is trying to
do right by everybody...

2018
01:27:55,584 --> 01:27:57,151
The investors.

2019
01:27:57,152 --> 01:27:58,719
The company.

2020
01:27:58,720 --> 01:27:59,720
You.

2021
01:28:01,322 --> 01:28:03,207
She's got a lot
on her shoulders.

2022
01:28:03,208 --> 01:28:05,093
The pressure is unbelievable.

2023
01:28:07,396 --> 01:28:10,832
Am I wrong
that I want it to happen?

2024
01:28:10,833 --> 01:28:14,268
I mean,
I-I want what she wants,

2025
01:28:14,269 --> 01:28:17,071
But you know what it's like
around here.

2026
01:28:17,072 --> 01:28:20,042
We don't see her enough,
and maybe this can fix that.

2027
01:28:20,043 --> 01:28:23,345
A CEO's gonna fix
what's going on here, Matt?

2028
01:28:26,481 --> 01:28:30,151
Whatever she decides, I just...
I want it to be good for her.

2029
01:28:30,152 --> 01:28:32,721
I want her to be happy.

2030
01:28:34,555 --> 01:28:35,956
Of course.

2031
01:28:35,957 --> 01:28:38,660
She deserves that.

2032
01:28:39,727 --> 01:28:43,332
Yeah, she does deserve it.

2033
01:28:50,805 --> 01:28:52,741
Hi, Amy.

2034
01:28:58,479 --> 01:29:00,682
Benjamin, what do you think?

2035
01:29:00,683 --> 01:29:01,915
Found it on eBay.

2036
01:29:01,916 --> 01:29:03,318
You were right.
Total classic.

2037
01:29:03,319 --> 01:29:05,086
It's awesome, kid.

2038
01:29:05,087 --> 01:29:06,853
♪ And many more?

2039
01:29:31,246 --> 01:29:32,612
So, how did it go?

2040
01:29:32,613 --> 01:29:34,782
Oh. Well, you have a great kid,
Jules.

2041
01:29:34,783 --> 01:29:36,183
She's adorable.

2042
01:29:36,184 --> 01:29:39,019
Oh, thank you so much
for doing that.

2043
01:29:39,020 --> 01:29:41,723
So, you excited about our trip
to San Francisco tomorrow?

2044
01:29:43,125 --> 01:29:45,660
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

2045
01:29:46,794 --> 01:29:49,097
Oh, I hope you don't have
what Matt has.

2046
01:29:49,098 --> 01:29:50,097
I don't.

2047
01:29:50,098 --> 01:29:51,232
You sure?

2048
01:29:51,233 --> 01:29:52,367
Positive.

2049
01:29:54,068 --> 01:29:55,152
What's that?

2050
01:29:55,153 --> 01:29:56,236
Blood pressure.

2051
01:29:56,237 --> 01:29:58,238
I take it every day.

2052
01:29:58,239 --> 01:30:00,707
- Are you sure you're okay?
- Yeah.

2053
01:30:00,708 --> 01:30:02,876
You don't look like you.
You're all flushed.

2054
01:30:02,877 --> 01:30:05,046
Why don't you go see Fiona,
the masseuse,

2055
01:30:05,047 --> 01:30:06,747
And just chill a little.

2056
01:30:06,748 --> 01:30:07,747
What's up?

2057
01:30:07,748 --> 01:30:09,483
Whoa, Ben, you okay?

2058
01:30:09,484 --> 01:30:12,320
You seem to be
slightly malfunctioning.

2059
01:30:12,321 --> 01:30:14,723
Becky.
Does he look right to you?

2060
01:30:14,724 --> 01:30:16,390
Okay. Thank you.

2061
01:30:16,391 --> 01:30:17,775
I think we're good here.

2062
01:30:17,776 --> 01:30:19,160
Got a lot of work to do.

2063
01:30:19,161 --> 01:30:20,927
It's all good.

2064
01:30:20,928 --> 01:30:23,063
Is it his coloring?

2065
01:30:23,064 --> 01:30:24,398
Oh, my god, you're all nuts.

2066
01:30:24,399 --> 01:30:25,733
I'm 100%.
Let's move on, kids.

2067
01:30:25,734 --> 01:30:27,569
Big day. Lots to do.

2068
01:30:27,570 --> 01:30:29,837
Okay. Ben...

2069
01:30:29,838 --> 01:30:32,206
if I am giving you too much to
do or working you too hard,

2070
01:30:32,207 --> 01:30:34,776
Please do not feel that you have
to go with me to San Francisco.

2071
01:30:34,777 --> 01:30:37,045
Jules, people my age
get tired sometimes.

2072
01:30:37,046 --> 01:30:38,513
That's all this is.

2073
01:30:38,514 --> 01:30:39,980
You're tired?

2074
01:30:39,981 --> 01:30:42,384
That's why you haven't looked at
me once since I came over here?

2075
01:30:43,918 --> 01:30:45,454
I'm looking at you.

2076
01:30:48,089 --> 01:30:50,559
Jules.
Cameron's on the phone.

2077
01:30:50,560 --> 01:30:51,892
Okay.

2078
01:30:51,893 --> 01:30:54,930
Like, if you don't feel better
tonight or late...

2079
01:30:54,931 --> 01:30:57,532
I'm just saying
I can go by myself, okay?

2080
01:30:57,533 --> 01:31:00,335
I'm a big girl.
I'll be fine.

2081
01:31:09,410 --> 01:31:11,328
Okay, seriously?

2082
01:31:11,329 --> 01:31:13,247
Ben, what is it?

2083
01:31:13,248 --> 01:31:15,149
You know, I'm a sensitive man.

2084
01:31:15,150 --> 01:31:17,052
People don't
think that about me.

2085
01:31:17,053 --> 01:31:18,452
I don't look it, but I am.

2086
01:31:18,453 --> 01:31:20,688
- Under all this man stuff that you so admire...
- Mm-Hmm.

2087
01:31:20,689 --> 01:31:23,892
...I'm just
a big bowl of mush.

2088
01:31:23,893 --> 01:31:25,827
I know that.

2089
01:31:25,828 --> 01:31:27,429
Okay.

2090
01:31:29,030 --> 01:31:30,564
That's it?

2091
01:31:30,565 --> 01:31:33,067
That's what
24 hours of crazy comes to?

2092
01:31:33,068 --> 01:31:35,570
That you're
a sensitive bowl of mush?

2093
01:31:35,571 --> 01:31:38,039
Jules.

2094
01:31:38,040 --> 01:31:40,509
Ben.

2095
01:31:42,376 --> 01:31:44,411
Jules, what are we doing here?

2096
01:31:44,412 --> 01:31:46,414
We got the day off.
We're traveling in first-Class.

2097
01:31:46,415 --> 01:31:48,049
Let's at least
have a little fun.

2098
01:31:48,050 --> 01:31:50,785
Now, that, I can do.

2099
01:32:17,645 --> 01:32:20,515
Ladies and gentlemen,
as we start our descent,

2100
01:32:20,516 --> 01:32:22,717
Please make sure your seat
backs and tray tables

2101
01:32:22,718 --> 01:32:24,669
Are in their full,
upright positions

2102
01:32:24,670 --> 01:32:26,662
And all carryon luggage
is stowed

2103
01:32:26,663 --> 01:32:28,656
Under the seat in front of you.

2104
01:32:28,657 --> 01:32:29,774
You okay?

2105
01:32:29,775 --> 01:32:30,891
Yeah.

2106
01:32:30,892 --> 01:32:32,627
Just thinking,
tomorrow I meet the guy

2107
01:32:32,628 --> 01:32:34,528
Who may become my boss, kind of.

2108
01:32:34,529 --> 01:32:36,781
I mean a lot of people
have bosses, right?

2109
01:32:36,782 --> 01:32:38,891
- Most people have bosses.
- Jules, it's simple.

2110
01:32:38,892 --> 01:32:41,002
If you think Townsend
is gonna be good for you

2111
01:32:41,003 --> 01:32:42,803
And good for the company,
then do it.

2112
01:32:42,804 --> 01:32:43,805
And if not...

2113
01:32:43,806 --> 01:32:44,738
exactly.

2114
01:32:44,739 --> 01:32:46,607
Just because
I came all way here...

2115
01:32:46,608 --> 01:32:48,710
right.
Doesn't mean anything.

2116
01:32:48,711 --> 01:32:50,312
I agree.

2117
01:32:52,113 --> 01:32:53,547
Do you think I can take a xanax

2118
01:32:53,548 --> 01:32:55,750
If I had two glasses of wine
an hour ago?

2119
01:32:55,751 --> 01:32:58,320
Well, I'd wait
another couple hours.

2120
01:33:03,491 --> 01:33:07,095
It's a thing I do before I land.
We're good now.

2121
01:33:18,073 --> 01:33:19,840
- Jules?
- Yeah.

2122
01:33:19,841 --> 01:33:21,876
- You hear that?
- Uh-Huh. I hear it. I'm up.

2123
01:33:39,493 --> 01:33:40,493
Are you okay?

2124
01:33:40,494 --> 01:33:41,728
This alarm going off

2125
01:33:41,729 --> 01:33:43,464
Is not a good omen
about this guy.

2126
01:33:43,465 --> 01:33:45,666
- It's a sign, Ben.
- Oh, I'm pretty sure it's not.

2127
01:33:45,667 --> 01:33:47,668
So you haven't
taken a xanax, yet?

2128
01:33:47,669 --> 01:33:49,637
You told me to wait a few hours.

2129
01:33:49,638 --> 01:33:51,606
You travel with your own robe?

2130
01:33:51,607 --> 01:33:53,307
Yeah.

2131
01:33:53,308 --> 01:33:54,675
Ladies and gentlemen,

2132
01:33:54,676 --> 01:33:56,794
A smoke alarm went off
in one of the rooms,

2133
01:33:56,795 --> 01:33:58,913
But the problem
has been taken care of.

2134
01:33:58,914 --> 01:33:59,879
Our sincerest apologies.

2135
01:33:59,880 --> 01:34:01,983
Oh, yeah.
100 people, 2 elevators.

2136
01:34:01,984 --> 01:34:04,386
Definitely a sign.

2137
01:34:06,587 --> 01:34:08,256
Well,
thanks for escorting me back.

2138
01:34:08,257 --> 01:34:09,591
Mm-Hmm.

2139
01:34:13,094 --> 01:34:15,229
You want to see my room?

2140
01:34:15,230 --> 01:34:16,530
Oh, nice.

2141
01:34:16,531 --> 01:34:19,650
I mean,
do you actually want to come in?

2142
01:34:19,651 --> 01:34:22,770
I have a tea kettle.
We could have tea or...

2143
01:34:24,806 --> 01:34:27,575
I'm ridiculously nervous
about tomorrow.

2144
01:34:32,046 --> 01:34:33,380
You can lie down.

2145
01:34:33,381 --> 01:34:35,517
I know you're tired.
I'll sit in the chair.

2146
01:34:47,161 --> 01:34:48,596
Here you go.

2147
01:34:52,600 --> 01:34:54,201
I thought you were gonna
sit in a chair?

2148
01:34:54,202 --> 01:34:58,373
Please let me be here.
I need to lie down, too.

2149
01:34:59,641 --> 01:35:01,709
We don't have to talk about work
or anything.

2150
01:35:01,710 --> 01:35:05,479
All right.
What should we talk about?

2151
01:35:05,480 --> 01:35:07,782
Marriage?

2152
01:35:10,385 --> 01:35:13,253
Will you tell me
about your wife?

2153
01:35:13,254 --> 01:35:14,922
She was great, right?

2154
01:35:14,923 --> 01:35:16,723
She was.

2155
01:35:16,724 --> 01:35:19,459
Molly was her name.

2156
01:35:19,460 --> 01:35:22,130
She was
a middle-School principal.

2157
01:35:22,131 --> 01:35:23,648
Beloved.

2158
01:35:23,649 --> 01:35:25,641
So perfect.

2159
01:35:25,642 --> 01:35:27,472
Long marriage?

2160
01:35:27,473 --> 01:35:29,303
Not long enough.

2161
01:35:29,304 --> 01:35:30,671
42 years.

2162
01:35:30,672 --> 01:35:33,307
Wow.
What was that like?

2163
01:35:33,308 --> 01:35:35,943
You know when people say
they want to grow old together?

2164
01:35:35,944 --> 01:35:38,980
- Mm-Hmm.
- Well, we did that.

2165
01:35:38,981 --> 01:35:40,280
We met when we were 20.

2166
01:35:40,281 --> 01:35:42,916
Well, I was 20.
She was 19.

2167
01:35:42,917 --> 01:35:46,554
And what was amazing
is she never really changed.

2168
01:35:46,555 --> 01:35:49,023
That's a hard thing to pull off.

2169
01:35:49,024 --> 01:35:51,492
She handled life
like it was easy.

2170
01:35:51,493 --> 01:35:53,359
Always.

2171
01:35:53,360 --> 01:35:56,398
Even when it wasn't.

2172
01:35:57,498 --> 01:35:59,434
God, I envy that.

2173
01:36:02,169 --> 01:36:03,438
Are you hungry?

2174
01:36:05,506 --> 01:36:07,507
We have, um...

2175
01:36:07,508 --> 01:36:10,911
gummy bears, chocolate chips,
Pringles.

2176
01:36:10,912 --> 01:36:11,945
Yup.

2177
01:36:11,946 --> 01:36:14,748
I'm just gonna bring
the whole thing.

2178
01:36:14,749 --> 01:36:17,551
You know those are
like 15 bucks each?

2179
01:36:17,552 --> 01:36:20,287
Benjamin, I run a very big
internet company.

2180
01:36:20,288 --> 01:36:22,957
Let's go crazy.

2181
01:36:22,958 --> 01:36:24,809
Okay.

2182
01:36:24,810 --> 01:36:26,661
So...

2183
01:36:28,463 --> 01:36:30,797
so...

2184
01:36:30,798 --> 01:36:32,834
Yeah, so...

2185
01:36:34,769 --> 01:36:37,605
I got a weird one for you.

2186
01:36:40,308 --> 01:36:42,544
Matt is cheating on me.

2187
01:36:44,078 --> 01:36:46,413
Wait a minute.
You know about this?

2188
01:36:46,414 --> 01:36:48,481
What does that mean?

2189
01:36:48,482 --> 01:36:50,118
Wait, you know about this?

2190
01:36:51,685 --> 01:36:53,670
I saw them together.

2191
01:36:53,671 --> 01:36:55,656
Oh, my god. When?

2192
01:36:55,657 --> 01:36:58,458
Yesterday.

2193
01:36:58,459 --> 01:36:59,892
I'm... I'm sorry.

2194
01:36:59,893 --> 01:37:03,197
I mean, it was an accident
that I saw them, but I did.

2195
01:37:03,198 --> 01:37:05,732
Yesterday.

2196
01:37:05,733 --> 01:37:08,036
Then it is still going on.

2197
01:37:09,703 --> 01:37:11,539
How long have you known?

2198
01:37:11,540 --> 01:37:14,374
For like 18 days.

2199
01:37:14,375 --> 01:37:16,244
She's a mom at Paige's school.

2200
01:37:17,545 --> 01:37:18,978
It's still so hard
for me to grasp.

2201
01:37:18,979 --> 01:37:21,348
L-I was in the kitchen
making sandwiches,

2202
01:37:21,349 --> 01:37:22,733
And his phone was there.

2203
01:37:22,734 --> 01:37:24,117
He was upstairs with Paige,

2204
01:37:24,118 --> 01:37:25,920
And h-He was getting
all these text messages.

2205
01:37:25,921 --> 01:37:28,055
And I don't know why,
but I read them.

2206
01:37:28,056 --> 01:37:30,824
It was not good.

2207
01:37:30,825 --> 01:37:32,526
Does he know you know?

2208
01:37:32,527 --> 01:37:33,894
No.

2209
01:37:33,895 --> 01:37:36,597
'Cause, honestly, I'm...
I'm not ready...

2210
01:37:36,598 --> 01:37:37,998
to deal with it.

2211
01:37:37,999 --> 01:37:40,234
I would like to be
a little less devastated,

2212
01:37:40,235 --> 01:37:41,803
If that is possible.

2213
01:37:42,904 --> 01:37:45,105
It's classic, though, isn't it?

2214
01:37:45,106 --> 01:37:46,373
The successful wife.

2215
01:37:46,374 --> 01:37:48,308
The husband feels like
his manhood is threatened,

2216
01:37:48,309 --> 01:37:50,043
So he acts out.

2217
01:37:50,044 --> 01:37:53,748
Girlfriend, I guess,
makes him feel more like a man.

2218
01:37:53,749 --> 01:37:57,084
Sometimes I'm not sure
I know how to do that.

2219
01:37:57,085 --> 01:37:59,270
Hold on, hold on, hold on.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

2220
01:37:59,271 --> 01:38:01,456
You're not actually taking the
rap for any of this, are you?

2221
01:38:01,457 --> 01:38:03,657
No! No, no.

2222
01:38:03,658 --> 01:38:05,126
He is the one
doing something wrong.

2223
01:38:05,127 --> 01:38:06,159
I get that.

2224
01:38:06,160 --> 01:38:08,645
Monogam-ish
is not what I'm after.

2225
01:38:08,646 --> 01:38:11,131
I- I'm just...
I'm taking a sec...

2226
01:38:11,132 --> 01:38:14,334
and I'm hoping that it's just
a horrible lapse in judgment

2227
01:38:14,335 --> 01:38:15,768
And not, like, love.

2228
01:38:15,769 --> 01:38:19,005
And once he moves through this,

2229
01:38:19,006 --> 01:38:21,842
We will eventually
be able to be okay again.

2230
01:38:21,843 --> 01:38:23,711
What do you think about that?

2231
01:38:25,246 --> 01:38:27,715
Clearly you don't think
that's a possible thing.

2232
01:38:27,716 --> 01:38:31,035
- It... It would be unusual.
- I get that.

2233
01:38:31,036 --> 01:38:34,355
I get not everybody
could do that, but...

2234
01:38:34,356 --> 01:38:36,790
everybody's not us.

2235
01:38:36,791 --> 01:38:39,209
I have faith in us because...

2236
01:38:39,210 --> 01:38:41,628
I believe he still loves me.

2237
01:38:41,629 --> 01:38:45,833
And, you know, we've been
going through so much that...

2238
01:38:47,368 --> 01:38:50,004
god, I wish your expressions
weren't so transparent.

2239
01:38:50,005 --> 01:38:53,273
Some couples do survive
these things, you know.

2240
01:38:53,274 --> 01:38:55,576
I googled it..."Staying
together after the affair."

2241
01:38:55,577 --> 01:38:57,879
And a lot of couples,
I mean, a lot stay together.

2242
01:38:57,880 --> 01:38:59,714
And anyway,
there is something to be said

2243
01:38:59,715 --> 01:39:01,047
About moving through it

2244
01:39:01,048 --> 01:39:04,552
And focusing on us
and not on the affair.

2245
01:39:04,553 --> 01:39:07,286
I don't want to give up on him.

2246
01:39:07,287 --> 01:39:10,291
I know him,
and I know he knows better.

2247
01:39:11,625 --> 01:39:14,294
But I am only human,

2248
01:39:14,295 --> 01:39:16,965
And I am so mad at him.

2249
01:39:18,265 --> 01:39:20,335
You know, so much
has happened to us so fast.

2250
01:39:20,336 --> 01:39:22,568
I think...

2251
01:39:22,569 --> 01:39:24,003
Part of me
was even expecting this.

2252
01:39:24,004 --> 01:39:26,006
Like, you know, he was
the more successful one

2253
01:39:26,007 --> 01:39:28,009
- When we started out.
- No, I didn't know that.

2254
01:39:28,010 --> 01:39:30,210
Yeah, he was.
He was a rising star.

2255
01:39:30,211 --> 01:39:32,346
And he bowed out
so that I could do this.

2256
01:39:32,347 --> 01:39:34,514
He was amazing.

2257
01:39:34,515 --> 01:39:36,284
It was all his idea.

2258
01:39:37,352 --> 01:39:38,952
I'm sure that's why
I'm even considering

2259
01:39:38,953 --> 01:39:40,220
This whole CEO thing,

2260
01:39:40,221 --> 01:39:42,823
Thinking maybe
someone else coming in

2261
01:39:42,824 --> 01:39:45,426
Will help me
get my life back on track.

2262
01:39:45,427 --> 01:39:46,859
Okay, that...
That's it.

2263
01:39:46,860 --> 01:39:48,929
I hate to be the feminist here,
between the two of us,

2264
01:39:48,930 --> 01:39:51,615
But you should be able to have
a huge career and be who you are

2265
01:39:51,616 --> 01:39:54,301
Without having to accept that
your husband is having an affair

2266
01:39:54,302 --> 01:39:55,502
As some kind of payback.

2267
01:39:55,503 --> 01:39:56,586
Right on.

2268
01:39:56,587 --> 01:39:58,146
I mean it.

2269
01:39:58,147 --> 01:39:59,706
Me, too.

2270
01:39:59,707 --> 01:40:01,058
But such is life, my friend.

2271
01:40:01,059 --> 01:40:02,409
No, it isn't.
Not always.

2272
01:40:02,410 --> 01:40:04,378
And I'm not so sure
I'd be so forgiving.

2273
01:40:04,379 --> 01:40:05,879
I am not so forgiving.

2274
01:40:05,880 --> 01:40:07,881
I'm saying that I could
potentially be forgiving.

2275
01:40:07,882 --> 01:40:10,584
But don't think that I
don't feel what's going on here.

2276
01:40:10,585 --> 01:40:12,619
It's crushing.

2277
01:40:12,620 --> 01:40:14,855
And when I think of Paige...

2278
01:40:14,856 --> 01:40:16,857
oh, don't.

2279
01:40:16,858 --> 01:40:20,411
Also, if we got divorced,
he'd remarry.

2280
01:40:20,412 --> 01:40:23,965
Maybe not to this girl,
but someone.

2281
01:40:26,667 --> 01:40:29,070
And we both know I'm not easy.

2282
01:40:30,404 --> 01:40:33,907
So I could be, like, single
forever, which means that...

2283
01:40:33,908 --> 01:40:36,276
forgive me, but this does

2284
01:40:36,277 --> 01:40:39,146
Keep me up
in the middle of the night.

2285
01:40:39,147 --> 01:40:40,397
Oh.

2286
01:40:40,398 --> 01:40:41,648
What?

2287
01:40:41,649 --> 01:40:44,184
That I don't want to
be buried alone.

2288
01:40:44,185 --> 01:40:45,585
Paige'll be with her husband,

2289
01:40:45,586 --> 01:40:47,054
And Matt'll be
with his new family,

2290
01:40:47,055 --> 01:40:48,522
And I will be
buried with strangers.

2291
01:40:48,523 --> 01:40:52,393
I will buried in the strangers
singles section of the cemetery.

2292
01:40:52,394 --> 01:40:55,746
Not that that is a reason
to stay together.

2293
01:40:55,747 --> 01:40:58,891
But it's just, you know,
a scary sidebar.

2294
01:40:58,892 --> 01:41:02,036
Let's take that one
off your plate right now.

2295
01:41:02,037 --> 01:41:03,938
You can be buried with
me and molly.

2296
01:41:03,939 --> 01:41:06,206
I happen to have space, okay?

2297
01:41:06,207 --> 01:41:08,741
Oh.

2298
01:41:08,742 --> 01:41:12,245
Thank you so much.
That is...

2299
01:41:12,246 --> 01:41:14,749
and to think
I didn't even want to hire you.

2300
01:41:14,750 --> 01:41:17,017
The one time
I don't have my hanky.

2301
01:41:23,958 --> 01:41:27,461
You want to...

2302
01:41:27,462 --> 01:41:29,762
watch TV?

2303
01:41:29,763 --> 01:41:31,531
Just for a few minutes?

2304
01:41:31,532 --> 01:41:33,301
Yeah, sure, I would.

2305
01:41:37,571 --> 01:41:39,473
Even though
the planned merger has...

2306
01:41:41,308 --> 01:41:47,482
♪ Were meant for me?

2307
01:41:48,883 --> 01:41:55,490
♪ And I was meant for you?

2308
01:41:57,057 --> 01:42:01,027
♪ Nature patterned you?

2309
01:42:01,028 --> 01:42:04,998
♪ And when she was done?

2310
01:42:04,999 --> 01:42:09,570
♪ You were all the sweet things?

2311
01:42:09,571 --> 01:42:12,289
♪ Rolled up in one?

2312
01:42:12,290 --> 01:42:15,008
♪ You're like?

2313
01:42:15,009 --> 01:42:22,749
♪ A plaintive melody?

2314
01:42:22,750 --> 01:42:31,258
♪ That never lets me free?

2315
01:42:31,259 --> 01:42:35,261
♪ But I'm content?

2316
01:42:35,262 --> 01:42:40,000
♪ The angels must have sent you?

2317
01:42:40,001 --> 01:42:44,872
♪ And they meant you?

2318
01:42:44,873 --> 01:42:48,776
♪ Just for me?

2319
01:43:28,115 --> 01:43:29,617
Airport, please.

2320
01:43:40,827 --> 01:43:43,395
So, did we like him?

2321
01:43:43,396 --> 01:43:46,332
He said all the right things.

2322
01:43:46,333 --> 01:43:49,635
He said that no one knows
about the fit like me.

2323
01:43:49,636 --> 01:43:53,407
That he doesn't want to remove
the soul of the company.

2324
01:43:53,408 --> 01:43:55,909
He said that
he doesn't have a plan.

2325
01:43:55,910 --> 01:43:58,411
He wants to watch us
and see what works.

2326
01:43:58,412 --> 01:44:02,884
He was polite and respectful
and super smart.

2327
01:44:03,950 --> 01:44:05,620
And I hired him.

2328
01:44:07,454 --> 01:44:08,622
Seriously?

2329
01:44:08,623 --> 01:44:10,123
Yeah.

2330
01:44:10,124 --> 01:44:11,624
You did it right in the room?

2331
01:44:11,625 --> 01:44:14,161
He told me to sleep on it
and that we'd talk tomorrow,

2332
01:44:14,162 --> 01:44:17,163
But I said the job was his.

2333
01:44:17,164 --> 01:44:19,832
We shook hands on it.

2334
01:44:19,833 --> 01:44:24,939
You know if, uh, we disagree,
he's the tiebreaker?

2335
01:44:24,940 --> 01:44:27,541
Of course.
He's the CEO.

2336
01:44:27,542 --> 01:44:30,511
Yeah. Duh.

2337
01:44:46,560 --> 01:44:47,978
Hi.

2338
01:44:47,979 --> 01:44:49,397
Hey!

2339
01:44:54,234 --> 01:44:55,634
You smell minty.

2340
01:44:55,635 --> 01:44:57,571
I just made mint tea.

2341
01:44:57,572 --> 01:44:59,990
So...

2342
01:44:59,991 --> 01:45:02,410
yes? No?

2343
01:45:03,777 --> 01:45:05,077
I did it.

2344
01:45:05,078 --> 01:45:06,913
I liked him.
A lot.

2345
01:45:06,914 --> 01:45:09,850
And, uh...
I offered him the job.

2346
01:45:09,851 --> 01:45:11,952
Wow. Really?

2347
01:45:11,953 --> 01:45:13,986
Yeah.

2348
01:45:13,987 --> 01:45:16,457
And you're okay with it?

2349
01:45:16,458 --> 01:45:18,391
Yeah.

2350
01:45:18,392 --> 01:45:20,995
I think it'll be good for us.

2351
01:45:28,635 --> 01:45:33,641
Do we have any, like, real
booze, like vodka or something?

2352
01:45:33,642 --> 01:45:35,109
Yeah.

2353
01:45:44,385 --> 01:45:47,921
Did "good for us" mean...

2354
01:45:47,922 --> 01:45:49,757
about the fit...

2355
01:45:49,758 --> 01:45:53,025
or us?

2356
01:45:53,026 --> 01:45:55,262
You-And-Me us.

2357
01:45:58,065 --> 01:46:00,901
I figure if someone else can
call some of the shots at work,

2358
01:46:00,902 --> 01:46:02,735
Then maybe...

2359
01:46:02,736 --> 01:46:05,539
we can get back to
where we were 18 months ago.

2360
01:46:06,840 --> 01:46:09,175
They say you can't put the genie
back in the bottle,

2361
01:46:09,176 --> 01:46:11,412
But we can try, right?

2362
01:47:28,054 --> 01:47:29,405
Hey!

2363
01:47:29,406 --> 01:47:30,756
Hi.

2364
01:47:30,757 --> 01:47:32,025
Wait, you live here?

2365
01:47:32,026 --> 01:47:34,461
Yeah, Ben's been putting me up
until I can find a place.

2366
01:47:34,462 --> 01:47:36,263
Oh, should I let him know
that you're here?

2367
01:47:36,264 --> 01:47:37,798
That's okay.
I'll ring.

2368
01:47:37,799 --> 01:47:39,366
Okay.

2369
01:47:44,972 --> 01:47:46,389
Fiona?!

2370
01:47:46,390 --> 01:47:47,807
Jules!

2371
01:47:47,808 --> 01:47:49,176
Come on in.

2372
01:47:52,346 --> 01:47:54,714
I'm just on my way to work.

2373
01:47:54,715 --> 01:47:56,617
Ben's right in here.

2374
01:48:03,289 --> 01:48:05,292
I'll let you two talk.

2375
01:48:08,062 --> 01:48:09,629
- See you.
- Mm-Hmm.

2376
01:48:09,630 --> 01:48:11,130
Hi.

2377
01:48:11,131 --> 01:48:12,631
Wow.

2378
01:48:12,632 --> 01:48:14,802
You and Fiona, huh?
Who knew.

2379
01:48:14,803 --> 01:48:16,369
She's a great gal.

2380
01:48:16,370 --> 01:48:19,906
She surprised me last night.
She brought over dinner.

2381
01:48:19,907 --> 01:48:21,474
It's brand-New.

2382
01:48:21,475 --> 01:48:24,745
Congratulations.
I love her.

2383
01:48:24,746 --> 01:48:26,614
Yeah.

2384
01:48:31,918 --> 01:48:34,955
So, I was ready kind of early
this morning, since about 4:00,

2385
01:48:34,956 --> 01:48:37,424
And Matt and Paige left an hour
ago for a field trip

2386
01:48:37,425 --> 01:48:39,493
So I thought I'd come by.
I hope that's okay.

2387
01:48:39,494 --> 01:48:41,060
Yeah.

2388
01:48:43,197 --> 01:48:46,099
I just wanted to say...

2389
01:48:46,100 --> 01:48:48,601
I slept on it.

2390
01:48:48,602 --> 01:48:51,537
I haven't called Townsend
yet, but...

2391
01:48:51,538 --> 01:48:54,742
I still feel like
it's the right thing to do.

2392
01:48:57,244 --> 01:48:59,679
Well...

2393
01:48:59,680 --> 01:49:02,782
I didn't sleep so well myself.

2394
01:49:02,783 --> 01:49:04,317
Over this?

2395
01:49:04,318 --> 01:49:06,386
You remember the day
I drove you to the warehouse?

2396
01:49:06,387 --> 01:49:08,455
You were giving me the
wrong directions and all that?

2397
01:49:08,456 --> 01:49:09,823
Yeah. I remember.

2398
01:49:11,124 --> 01:49:12,608
Okay, well, I stood in the back,

2399
01:49:12,609 --> 01:49:14,468
And I watched you
show the workers

2400
01:49:14,469 --> 01:49:16,328
How to fold and box the clothes.

2401
01:49:16,329 --> 01:49:19,632
I knew then
that was why ATF was a success.

2402
01:49:19,633 --> 01:49:20,966
No one else is ever gonna have

2403
01:49:20,967 --> 01:49:24,238
That kind of commitment
to your company, Jules.

2404
01:49:24,239 --> 01:49:26,739
To me, it's pretty simple.

2405
01:49:26,740 --> 01:49:29,276
About the fit needs you,
and if you don't mind me saying,

2406
01:49:29,277 --> 01:49:30,709
You need it.

2407
01:49:30,710 --> 01:49:32,946
Someone may come in
with more experience than you,

2408
01:49:32,947 --> 01:49:35,598
But they're never gonna know
what you know.

2409
01:49:35,599 --> 01:49:38,251
I never had anything like this
in my life.

2410
01:49:38,252 --> 01:49:40,019
Not many people do.

2411
01:49:40,020 --> 01:49:43,991
This big, beautiful,
exciting thing that you created.

2412
01:49:43,992 --> 01:49:46,358
It's a dream, isn't it?

2413
01:49:46,359 --> 01:49:47,860
And you're gonna give that up

2414
01:49:47,861 --> 01:49:51,331
In the hopes that your husband
will stop having an affair?

2415
01:49:51,332 --> 01:49:53,899
I don't see how that adds up.

2416
01:49:53,900 --> 01:49:57,286
You should feel nothing but
great about what you've done.

2417
01:49:57,287 --> 01:50:00,674
And I'd hate to see you let
anyone take that away from you.

2418
01:50:06,380 --> 01:50:07,647
I guess you came over here

2419
01:50:07,648 --> 01:50:10,617
Because you wanted to hear
some of this.

2420
01:50:10,618 --> 01:50:12,217
Yes.

2421
01:50:12,218 --> 01:50:14,921
And maybe also
because you're my...

2422
01:50:14,922 --> 01:50:16,323
intern.

2423
01:50:17,691 --> 01:50:22,396
Well, I was gonna say
intern/best friend.

2424
01:50:23,630 --> 01:50:26,182
But there's no need to get
all sentimental about it

2425
01:50:26,183 --> 01:50:28,735
Even though we could potentially
be buried together.

2426
01:50:28,736 --> 01:50:30,770
Can't get closer than that.

2427
01:50:34,508 --> 01:50:36,192
It's moments like this
when you need

2428
01:50:36,193 --> 01:50:37,877
Someone you know
you can count on.

2429
01:50:37,878 --> 01:50:39,346
So thank you.

2430
01:50:42,316 --> 01:50:44,818
I like your house
so much by the way.

2431
01:50:44,819 --> 01:50:46,654
Thanks.

2432
01:50:51,091 --> 01:50:52,893
So?

2433
01:51:08,041 --> 01:51:09,826
Shall we?

2434
01:51:09,827 --> 01:51:11,612
Okay.

2435
01:51:17,317 --> 01:51:19,552
Welcome back, you two.

2436
01:51:19,553 --> 01:51:21,253
Jules, I have something cool
to show you.

2437
01:51:21,254 --> 01:51:23,155
Do you remember taking
a customer-Service call

2438
01:51:23,156 --> 01:51:25,959
About a bride whose bridesmaids'
dresses showed up in gray,

2439
01:51:25,960 --> 01:51:27,427
And we had the vendor
remake them overnight

2440
01:51:27,428 --> 01:51:28,928
And put them on a plane?

2441
01:51:28,929 --> 01:51:30,430
Yeah. Yeah.
Rachel.

2442
01:51:30,431 --> 01:51:32,166
Check this out.

2443
01:51:33,934 --> 01:51:36,102
The silk chiffon
Antoinette dress.

2444
01:51:36,103 --> 01:51:38,504
They look beautiful.

2445
01:51:38,505 --> 01:51:41,608
Oh, and these just arrived
from mark Townsend.

2446
01:51:43,911 --> 01:51:45,446
- Here.
- Thanks.

2447
01:51:55,755 --> 01:51:57,891
Becky? Give me Townsend's
number, will you?

2448
01:51:57,892 --> 01:51:59,658
Okay.

2449
01:52:01,963 --> 01:52:03,362
This is Jules.

2450
01:52:03,363 --> 01:52:05,465
Hey, Alonzo, what's up?

2451
01:52:05,466 --> 01:52:07,065
Uh-Huh. Okay.

2452
01:52:07,066 --> 01:52:09,703
Do we need that many?

2453
01:52:15,342 --> 01:52:17,243
I hope I'm not too late.

2454
01:52:17,244 --> 01:52:19,146
Don't do this for me, Jules.

2455
01:52:19,147 --> 01:52:20,279
Please?

2456
01:52:20,280 --> 01:52:22,249
Just do what feels right
for you.

2457
01:52:22,250 --> 01:52:24,151
Oh, my god.

2458
01:52:26,719 --> 01:52:29,723
I want to continue running
my company, Matt.

2459
01:52:29,724 --> 01:52:31,156
You got to know that.

2460
01:52:31,157 --> 01:52:34,160
Then do it.
I don't want you to be unhappy.

2461
01:52:34,161 --> 01:52:36,764
I'm already unhappy.

2462
01:52:39,299 --> 01:52:40,867
I need to tell you something.

2463
01:52:40,868 --> 01:52:42,569
I know.

2464
01:52:43,503 --> 01:52:45,571
Just tell me, is it almost over?

2465
01:52:45,572 --> 01:52:47,507
I don't know
how much longer I can...

2466
01:52:47,508 --> 01:52:49,741
It's over.

2467
01:52:49,742 --> 01:52:54,781
I can't tell you
how s-Sorry and ashamed I am.

2468
01:52:54,782 --> 01:52:57,716
I thought I could do it.

2469
01:52:57,717 --> 01:52:59,987
I thought I could be
the guy that I told you

2470
01:52:59,988 --> 01:53:02,020
I was going to be.

2471
01:53:02,021 --> 01:53:05,592
And then
somewhere along the way...

2472
01:53:07,427 --> 01:53:09,430
...I thought
I was losing you.

2473
01:53:11,498 --> 01:53:15,035
But it was actually me.

2474
01:53:15,036 --> 01:53:16,802
I got lost.

2475
01:53:16,803 --> 01:53:18,738
It's a confusing world
out there,

2476
01:53:18,739 --> 01:53:21,541
And who I am
got messed up for a minute.

2477
01:53:21,542 --> 01:53:27,581
And now I'm watching you ready
to give all this up for me.

2478
01:53:27,582 --> 01:53:30,850
I will not let that happen.

2479
01:53:30,851 --> 01:53:35,989
I love you, and I will do so
much better if you'll let me.

2480
01:53:41,561 --> 01:53:43,495
Please, Jules.

2481
01:53:43,496 --> 01:53:47,067
Let me make it right again.

2482
01:53:56,743 --> 01:53:58,912
You know what would be good?

2483
01:54:00,380 --> 01:54:02,616
If you carried a handkerchief.

2484
01:54:16,896 --> 01:54:19,498
Have you called Townsend yet?

2485
01:54:19,499 --> 01:54:22,336
Because if I've ever met anyone
who doesn't need a boss,

2486
01:54:22,337 --> 01:54:24,004
It was you.

2487
01:54:25,538 --> 01:54:29,009
I was just about to call him
and tell him I changed my mind.

2488
01:54:30,543 --> 01:54:32,512
I mean, we're good here.

2489
01:54:32,513 --> 01:54:34,747
We're gonna make it.

2490
01:54:34,748 --> 01:54:36,316
I'm gonna make sure we make it.

2491
01:54:36,317 --> 01:54:38,685
Good.

2492
01:55:00,674 --> 01:55:02,207
Becky.

2493
01:55:02,208 --> 01:55:03,642
Where's Ben?

2494
01:55:03,643 --> 01:55:07,080
I'm not sure. He said
he was taking the day off.

2495
01:55:11,986 --> 01:55:13,719
Fiona.

2496
01:55:13,720 --> 01:55:15,455
Do you know where Ben is?

2497
01:55:48,321 --> 01:55:49,723
I'm so sorry to interrupt.

2498
01:55:49,724 --> 01:55:52,157
That's okay.

2499
01:55:52,158 --> 01:55:55,228
Extend your left arm, Jules.

2500
01:55:55,229 --> 01:55:57,863
Left knee up...

2501
01:55:57,864 --> 01:56:01,902
breathe and relax
for inner balance.

2502
01:56:01,903 --> 01:56:04,004
- Am I doing it right?
- Almost.

2503
01:56:04,005 --> 01:56:06,089
Got something good to tell you.

2504
01:56:06,090 --> 01:56:08,175
Great.
Tell me when we're done.

2505
01:56:11,778 --> 01:56:14,715
Breathe deeply, Jules.

2506
01:56:19,653 --> 01:56:21,788
That's it, out there.

2507
01:56:21,789 --> 01:56:24,224
This up.
