00:11:47,274 --> 00:11:49,109
If I may, sir...

179
00:11:49,142 --> 00:11:50,778
I believe
I have skills and ideas

180
00:11:50,811 --> 00:11:52,212
that go well beyond
punching numbers

181
00:11:52,245 --> 00:11:53,180
into an adding machine.

182
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:54,657
Well, I've read about
this German fellow,

183
00:11:54,681 --> 00:11:56,316
Lilienthal, I believe,
who's developed

184
00:11:56,349 --> 00:11:58,886
a glider that can take
a man in the air, sir.

185
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:00,187
Isn't that amazing?

186
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,355
I mean, if you were
to apply that to this business,

187
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:03,757
it would be revolutionary.

188
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:06,626
Gentlemen!
Can I have your attention?

189
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:08,495
You're all dismissed.

190
00:12:09,629 --> 00:12:10,898
Bankrupt?

191
00:12:10,931 --> 00:12:13,000
I thought the company
had a dozen trading ships.

192
00:12:13,033 --> 00:12:15,135
Yes, at the bottom
of the South China Sea.

193
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:18,238
Typhoon sank 'em all.

194
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:58,145
- Tag, you're it!
- Oh, you're in for it!

195
00:12:58,979 --> 00:12:59,847
Hey.

196
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,515
Oh, God! You're home early.

197
00:13:02,549 --> 00:13:04,117
And until further notice.

198
00:13:08,155 --> 00:13:10,257
Well, I didn't think
you were long for that job.

199
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:12,092
Or any job, apparently.

200
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:14,561
That's what makes our life
together so exciting.

201
00:13:15,228 --> 00:13:16,930
Charity.

202
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:22,535
This isn't the life
I promised you.

203
00:13:22,569 --> 00:13:24,437
But I have everything I want.

204
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:26,006
What about the magic?

205
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:27,740
What do you call
those two girls?

206
00:13:30,477 --> 00:13:32,846
Hey, you partners, look who
moseyed into the corral.

207
00:13:34,581 --> 00:13:35,748
Daddy!

208
00:13:35,782 --> 00:13:37,093
- Come here!
- Did you bring a present?

209
00:13:37,117 --> 00:13:38,651
A present for what?

210
00:13:38,685 --> 00:13:40,287
- For my birthday!
- Your what?

211
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,990
- My birthday.
- It's not your birthday.

212
00:13:43,023 --> 00:13:45,926
Okay, I do have a present...

213
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:48,061
but not just any present.
Oh, no.

214
00:13:48,095 --> 00:13:51,531
The most amazing
birthday present ever.

215
00:13:51,564 --> 00:13:54,101
This extraordinary machine
was originally created

216
00:13:54,134 --> 00:13:56,036
by Leonardo da Vinci,
400 years ago.

217
00:13:56,069 --> 00:13:58,405
But the blueprints had been
lost for centuries

218
00:13:58,438 --> 00:14:00,707
until just last week,
on a stormy night,

219
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:02,842
when a sunken pirate ship
washed up

220
00:14:02,876 --> 00:14:04,644
on the shores of Nantucket.

221
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:06,947
They found skeletons
and treasures

222
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:08,781
and the blueprints
were recovered

223
00:14:08,815 --> 00:14:13,887
by none other
than J. W. Mercantile.

224
00:14:13,921 --> 00:14:16,289
The blueprints crossed my desk
very briefly

225
00:14:16,323 --> 00:14:18,358
but I managed
to commit them to memory.

226
00:14:18,391 --> 00:14:22,595
And if I have
remembered correctly...

227
00:14:29,169 --> 00:14:31,371
Happy birthday, Caroline.

228
00:14:38,745 --> 00:14:40,413
This is a wishing machine.

229
00:14:40,447 --> 00:14:42,349
You tell it your wishes...

230
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:46,286
and it keeps them safe
until they come true.

231
00:14:46,319 --> 00:14:50,323
Even if you forget them,
they're always there.

232
00:14:50,357 --> 00:14:51,491
Can I tell a wish?

233
00:14:51,524 --> 00:14:53,994
Step right up. Go ahead.

234
00:14:54,027 --> 00:14:57,797
I wish to marry Santa Claus.

235
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:59,632
That is a good wish.

236
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:04,504
I wish for ballet slippers.

237
00:15:10,577 --> 00:15:12,579
Hey, that's a good wish, too.

238
00:15:13,213 --> 00:15:14,982
What's your wish, Mommy?

239
00:15:16,683 --> 00:15:18,485
I wish...

240
00:15:22,889 --> 00:15:25,892
for happiness
like this forever

241
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,627
for you and you...

242
00:15:29,396 --> 00:15:31,231
and for your father.

243
00:15:31,731 --> 00:15:33,366
Boring!

244
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,068
Boring?

245
00:15:35,102 --> 00:15:38,371
Since when has happiness
ever been boring?

246
00:15:38,405 --> 00:15:41,441
♪ Ev'ry night I lie in bed ♪

247
00:15:41,474 --> 00:15:44,611

♪ For the world

254
00:16:26,086 --> 00:16:29,589
The goat prices go up,
so the pork bellies go down.

255
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:32,925
- Charles, we're leaving.
- Huh?

256
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:34,427
This bank only wants
to lend money

257
00:16:34,461 --> 00:16:35,595
to people with money.

258
00:16:40,033 --> 00:16:42,569
What are you
looking at, flop-doodle?

259
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,739
Mr. Barnum.

260
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:52,512
This venture you propose
is risky and somewhat bizarre.

261
00:16:52,545 --> 00:16:54,481
It's a good bet
is what it is, sir.

262
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:56,149
People don't
want to admit it...

263
00:16:56,183 --> 00:16:58,918
but they're fascinated
with the exotic and the macabre.

264
00:16:58,951 --> 00:17:00,587
It's why we stare at it.

265
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:03,423
The bank is going to need
substantial collateral.

266
00:17:04,691 --> 00:17:07,894
Of course. I, uh,
I wouldn't suggest otherwise.

267
00:17:07,927 --> 00:17:09,996
The deed and title
to my entire flotilla

268
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:11,231
of trading vessels.

269
00:17:14,634 --> 00:17:17,104
Why would a bank
loan us $10,000?

270
00:17:17,137 --> 00:17:19,439
Because we put up collateral.

271
00:17:19,472 --> 00:17:20,916
But, dear, we don't
have any collateral.

272
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:21,908
Sure we do.

273
00:17:21,941 --> 00:17:23,176
In the South China Seas.

274
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:24,877
In the South China Seas?

275
00:17:24,911 --> 00:17:27,114
Deep in the South China Seas.

276
00:17:27,147 --> 00:17:30,317
And what did
we buy with this loan?

277
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:33,553
"Barnum's American Museum
of Curiosities."

278
00:17:33,586 --> 00:17:35,255
What kind of museum is it?

279
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:39,392
A place to be transported.

280
00:17:39,426 --> 00:17:40,993
A place where people
can see things

281
00:17:41,027 --> 00:17:42,195
they've never seen before.

282
00:17:42,595 --> 00:17:43,396
Huh?

283
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:45,498
- Wax figures?
- Yeah. Yeah.

284
00:17:45,532 --> 00:17:47,367
They're all the rage
in Europe. Look.

285
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,002
Marie Antoinette with the
sore throat. Napoleon.

286
00:17:50,036 --> 00:17:51,904
Come here. See?

287
00:17:51,938 --> 00:17:54,807
You've already met some of the
most famous folks in history.

288
00:17:54,841 --> 00:17:56,176
But they're not all wax.

289
00:17:56,209 --> 00:17:59,679
This is the great O'Malley.

290
00:17:59,712 --> 00:18:02,449
Master of sleight of hand.
A king of deception.

291
00:18:02,482 --> 00:18:04,384
You don't look like a magician.

292
00:18:05,118 --> 00:18:06,653
I'm a thief.

293
00:18:06,686 --> 00:18:07,754
A very good thief.

294
00:18:07,787 --> 00:18:09,822
I caught him nicking my watch.

295
00:18:09,856 --> 00:18:10,923
- See?
- An elephant!

296
00:18:10,957 --> 00:18:12,024
Not just any elephant.

297
00:18:12,058 --> 00:18:13,025
I can get you
somethin' real nice.

298
00:18:13,059 --> 00:18:14,026
Just say the word.

299
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:15,061
Thank you.

300
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:16,396
Oh, yeah.
This is a ten-ton bull

301
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:18,398
straight from
the plains of Africa.

302
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:20,967
And look at that.

303
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,969
The tallest giraffe
in the world.

304
00:18:23,002 --> 00:18:24,471
Can I climb up its leg?

305
00:18:24,504 --> 00:18:26,873
Absolutely not. Okay.

306
00:18:26,906 --> 00:18:29,842
Now, I know how it looks.

307
00:18:29,876 --> 00:18:31,278
If you didn't,
I'd be worried.

308
00:18:31,311 --> 00:18:33,112
I mean, it just
needs a little work, but...

309
00:18:33,146 --> 00:18:34,557
The loan has to be
paid back every month.

310
00:18:34,581 --> 00:18:36,459
Oh, yeah, we're gonna pay it.
We just need customers.

311
00:18:36,483 --> 00:18:38,163
- Hundreds of them.
- We're gonna get them.

312
00:18:41,421 --> 00:18:43,055
Welcome to the Barnum Museum.

313
00:18:43,089 --> 00:18:44,424
It is one hour
of your time, sir,

314
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:45,958
but it will change your life.

315
00:18:45,992 --> 00:18:47,303
We have shows
on the hour every hour.

316
00:18:47,327 --> 00:18:48,961
I love your dress.

317
00:18:48,995 --> 00:18:50,430
Surely not for
the faint of heart,

318
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:52,332
but I can tell
you're gonna love it.

319
00:18:52,365 --> 00:18:54,234
Half price for anyone
who's wearing a hat.

320
00:18:54,267 --> 00:18:55,468
Ho, ho! That's you, sir.

321
00:18:55,502 --> 00:18:58,505
Welcome to the Barnum Museum.

322
00:19:04,511 --> 00:19:05,445
Load of garbage.

323
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:07,046
Goodness, no. It's rubbish.

324
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:09,124
Welcome to the Barnum Museum,
where everyone's special...

325
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:10,917
How many tickets?

326
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:13,220
- Three.
- Three.

327
00:19:38,378 --> 00:19:39,879
Daddy.

328
00:19:44,451 --> 00:19:45,852
Daddy.

329
00:19:51,057 --> 00:19:53,260
Did you sell
any more tickets today?

330
00:19:53,293 --> 00:19:55,395
A few. Yeah.

331
00:19:55,428 --> 00:19:57,664
Most everyone was rushing home,
it's Friday,

332
00:19:57,697 --> 00:20:02,635
but we sold a few.

333
00:20:02,669 --> 00:20:06,739
I think you have too many dead
things in your museum, Daddy.

334
00:20:06,773 --> 00:20:08,140
Do you?

335
00:20:08,174 --> 00:20:11,478
She's right.
You need something alive.

336
00:20:14,481 --> 00:20:16,115
Go to sleep, both of you.

337
00:20:16,148 --> 00:20:18,485
Something sensational.

338
00:20:19,118 --> 00:20:20,687
That's a big word.

339
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,889
It's your word.

340
00:20:22,922 --> 00:20:25,892
Something that isn't stuffed.

341
00:20:25,925 --> 00:20:28,428
- Like a mermaid.
- Or a unicorn.

342
00:20:29,796 --> 00:20:32,098
Unicorns aren't real.

343
00:20:32,131 --> 00:20:34,601
Well, mermaids
aren't real either.

344
00:21:01,127 --> 00:21:03,162
You must be Gertrude Stratton.

345
00:21:03,195 --> 00:21:04,464
I'm looking for your son.

346
00:21:05,231 --> 00:21:06,566
I don't have a son.

347
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:08,868
The hospital record says you do.

348
00:21:08,901 --> 00:21:11,338
Charles, right? Age 22?

349
00:21:16,075 --> 00:21:17,577
Charles!

350
00:21:19,078 --> 00:21:20,279
Charles!

351
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:35,695
P.T. Barnum, at your service.

352
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:39,666
I am putting together a show

353
00:21:39,699 --> 00:21:40,933
and I need a star.

354
00:21:42,068 --> 00:21:44,136
You want people
to laugh at me.

355
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:45,481
Well, they're laughing
anyway, kid,

356
00:21:45,505 --> 00:21:46,773
so might as well get paid.

357
00:21:56,182 --> 00:21:58,217
I see a soldier,
no, a general

358
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:01,721
riding across the stage
with a sword and a gun,

359
00:22:01,754 --> 00:22:03,322
and... and...

360
00:22:03,356 --> 00:22:05,858
and the most beautiful uniform
ever made.

361
00:22:05,892 --> 00:22:07,760
People will come
from all over the world,

362
00:22:07,794 --> 00:22:10,763
and when they see him,
they won't laugh.

363
00:22:15,968 --> 00:22:17,637
They'll salute.

364
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,787
How's it looking, girls?

365
00:22:41,461 --> 00:22:43,295
Hey! You looking for freaks?

366
00:22:43,329 --> 00:22:45,131
I know where
you can find one of them.

367
00:22:46,332 --> 00:22:47,534
Really?

368
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:53,506
Come on, girls.

369
00:22:57,844 --> 00:22:58,711
Hello.

370
00:22:58,745 --> 00:22:59,946
Sir, you shouldn't
be here.

371
00:22:59,979 --> 00:23:01,948
I'm sorry,
who's doing that singing?

372
00:23:05,017 --> 00:23:07,353
It's you, isn't it?

373
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:09,288
Sir, I'll have
to ask you to leave.

374
00:23:09,321 --> 00:23:11,157
You are so talented, blessed...

375
00:23:13,893 --> 00:23:15,161
Extraordinary.

376
00:23:16,429 --> 00:23:18,030
Unique.

377
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:21,033
I would even say beautiful.

378
00:23:23,302 --> 00:23:24,671
Sir.

379
00:23:25,337 --> 00:23:27,406
Please leave me alone.

380
00:23:34,747 --> 00:23:36,783
They don't understand,
but they will.

381
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:52,465
This line is so...

382
00:23:52,499 --> 00:23:56,168
Oh, my God! Oh, goodness.

383
00:23:56,202 --> 00:24:00,607
Okay. Anne and W.D. Wheeler.
Brother and sister?

384
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,342
- Yes, sir.
- Terrific. And what do you do?

385
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:04,477
Trapeze.

386
00:24:04,511 --> 00:24:06,846
Trapeze. Okay.

387
00:24:06,879 --> 00:24:08,447
You know, people
aren't gonna like it

388
00:24:08,481 --> 00:24:09,982
if you put us on the stage.

389
00:24:10,016 --> 00:24:12,118
Oh, I'm counting on it.

390
00:24:13,653 --> 00:24:16,455
Is this over your...

391
00:24:16,489 --> 00:24:17,690
Entire body.

392
00:24:17,724 --> 00:24:19,526
Terrific.
I don't need to see it.

393
00:24:23,062 --> 00:24:26,566
Now. Yes!

394
00:24:28,668 --> 00:24:30,302
Can I just ask
how heavy you are?

395
00:24:30,336 --> 00:24:31,871
Do you have a number for that?

396
00:24:31,904 --> 00:24:35,107
- I prefer not to say, but...
- Just between you and me.

397
00:24:35,141 --> 00:24:37,577
500 pounds.

398
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:41,748
- 750 pounds, you said?
- 750 pounds, it is!

399
00:24:51,257 --> 00:24:53,025
What is your name?

400
00:24:53,059 --> 00:24:55,528
Vasily Palvos, sir.

401
00:24:55,562 --> 00:24:57,129
Yeah, we're gonna
change that name.

402
00:24:57,163 --> 00:24:59,666
Uh, I think you're Irish.

403
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:03,002
We have a show!

404
00:25:04,637 --> 00:25:07,106
That's good,
but I need it five times bigger!

405
00:25:07,139 --> 00:25:08,307
And I want it everywhere!

406
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,909
Carriages,
sides of trains,

407
00:25:09,942 --> 00:25:13,445
trolleys, crates, milk bottles,
everywhere they look!

408
00:25:13,479 --> 00:25:16,148
Barnum's American Museum.

409
00:25:19,318 --> 00:25:20,853

00:31:13,372 --> 00:31:16,075
Well, hyperbole
isn't the worst crime.

534
00:31:16,108 --> 00:31:19,078
Men suffer more from imagining
too little than too much.

535
00:31:19,111 --> 00:31:21,547
The creed of a true fraud.

536
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:25,084
Mr. Bennett, when was
the last time you smiled

537
00:31:25,117 --> 00:31:27,519
or had a good laugh?
Like a real laugh?

538
00:31:28,988 --> 00:31:32,058
A theater critic who can't
find joy in the theater.

539
00:31:32,091 --> 00:31:34,326
Now who's a fraud?

540
00:31:36,695 --> 00:31:38,830
Oh, Mr. Bennett.

541
00:31:38,864 --> 00:31:41,633
That word you used
to describe my show?

542
00:31:42,701 --> 00:31:43,902
Has a nice ring to it.

543
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:55,714
And right this way.

544
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:58,917
Don't you think there's enough
blind trust in my life?

545
00:31:58,951 --> 00:32:00,619
Well, isn't that
what makes it fun?

546
00:32:00,652 --> 00:32:04,590
Keep coming. Okay.
Are you ready?

547
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:12,631
- Is it?
- It is.

548
00:32:15,701 --> 00:32:17,936
Come on. Let's go.

549
00:32:18,237 --> 00:32:19,471
Push.

550
00:32:21,607 --> 00:32:22,608
Wow.

551
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:26,278
Helen, that's for you.

552
00:32:29,015 --> 00:32:32,618
And Caroline,
this is for you.

553
00:32:39,992 --> 00:32:41,860
There's a ballet school
right down the street.

554
00:32:41,893 --> 00:32:44,463
Just past your
parents' house, actually.

555
00:32:46,198 --> 00:32:47,633
Don't tell me
you bought this house

556
00:32:47,666 --> 00:32:50,002
just to rub my parents' noses
in your success?

557
00:32:50,036 --> 00:32:52,238
Well, that wasn't
the only reason.

558
00:32:53,705 --> 00:32:56,042
This is the life I promised you.

559
00:32:56,742 --> 00:32:58,177
Shall we?

560
00:32:58,210 --> 00:33:01,680
Phin, it's beautiful,

561
00:33:01,713 --> 00:33:03,525
but you know, we don't
need all of this to be...

562
00:33:03,549 --> 00:33:04,983
It only took me 25 years,

563
00:33:05,017 --> 00:33:07,953
but welcome home,
Charity Barnum.

564
00:33:46,592 --> 00:33:48,794
- Hello, there.
- There goes Barnum.

565
00:33:56,168 --> 00:33:58,870
Hey, sweetheart,
who's that young man over there?

566
00:33:58,904 --> 00:34:00,672
Oh, that's Phillip Carlyle.

567
00:34:00,706 --> 00:34:03,109
A bit of a scandal, they say.

568
00:34:03,142 --> 00:34:04,710
His last play
was a hit in London.

569
00:34:04,743 --> 00:34:06,312
Play? You pay good money

570
00:34:06,345 --> 00:34:08,880
to watch people stand around
and talk for two hours

571
00:34:08,914 --> 00:34:10,349
and they call me a con man.

572
00:34:10,382 --> 00:34:13,719
Ew, what's that smell?
Do you smell that?

573
00:34:13,752 --> 00:34:15,954
Ew. Something does smell.

574
00:34:15,987 --> 00:34:18,824
Oh, I know what it is.
Peanuts.

575
00:34:28,567 --> 00:34:30,102
I can see it right now.

576
00:34:30,136 --> 00:34:31,437
"Youngest prima ballerina

577
00:34:31,470 --> 00:34:33,339
in the history
of the City Ballet."

578
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,242
I'm quitting.

579
00:34:36,275 --> 00:34:38,144
What? Why would you quit?

580
00:34:38,177 --> 00:34:40,579
I started too late.
I'll never catch up.

581
00:34:40,612 --> 00:34:42,748
Caroline, you were the best
dancer on that stage.

582
00:34:44,383 --> 00:34:47,119
What? You think
I can't spot talent?

583
00:34:47,153 --> 00:34:49,788
Ballet takes years
of hard work.

584
00:34:49,821 --> 00:34:51,190
It's not like the circus.

585
00:34:52,891 --> 00:34:54,160
You can't just fake it.

586
00:34:58,697 --> 00:34:59,931
She can't quit. No.

587
00:34:59,965 --> 00:35:01,200
No, I mean, she just...

588
00:35:01,233 --> 00:35:03,044
She just feels out of place
with the other girls.

589
00:35:03,068 --> 00:35:04,570
Well, I should
certainly hope so.

590
00:35:04,603 --> 00:35:06,905
I've never seen so many
little prima donnas in my life.

591
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:09,151
Yeah, but those prima donnas
are the most important thing

592
00:35:09,175 --> 00:35:10,476
in the world to her right now.

593
00:35:10,509 --> 00:35:12,878
She'll learn to ignore them
just like I did.

594
00:35:12,911 --> 00:35:14,313
She shouldn't have to.

595
00:35:14,346 --> 00:35:16,315
New York society
will never accept us.

596
00:35:16,348 --> 00:35:18,150
If they did,
they'd have to stop judging

597
00:35:18,184 --> 00:35:20,018
and actually do something
with their lives.

598
00:35:20,051 --> 00:35:21,420
This isn't about me.

599
00:35:22,554 --> 00:35:27,193
Oh. So it's different
than everything else then?

600
00:35:27,226 --> 00:35:29,861
I just want her to be proud
of who she is, of her family.

601
00:35:29,895 --> 00:35:31,963
She is proud.

602
00:35:31,997 --> 00:35:33,599
We don't have
to be the Carlyles.

603
00:35:39,238 --> 00:35:41,273
Mr. Carlyle.
You produced this play?

604
00:35:41,307 --> 00:35:43,442
Yes, I did indeed.

605
00:35:43,475 --> 00:35:45,677
Refunds are available
at the front box office.

606
00:35:45,711 --> 00:35:47,479
P.T. Barnum.

607
00:35:47,513 --> 00:35:48,414
From the circus?

608
00:35:48,447 --> 00:35:50,416
Yes. You... you've been?

609
00:35:50,449 --> 00:35:53,885
God, no. But I have
seen the crowds.

610
00:35:53,919 --> 00:35:56,531
People leave your shows a great deal
happier than when they came in.

611
00:35:56,555 --> 00:35:59,191
Which is much more
than I can say for my play.

612
00:35:59,225 --> 00:36:01,460
And yet, you have
no trouble selling tickets.

613
00:36:03,128 --> 00:36:04,863
That's because
I'm selling virtue.

614
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:08,500
Can I buy you a drink?

615
00:36:10,569 --> 00:36:12,871
I wanna go after
the carriage trade.

616
00:36:12,904 --> 00:36:14,973
Present legitimate acts,

617
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:18,344
expand our appeal,
go after the snobs.

618
00:36:18,377 --> 00:36:20,712
If you only knew
how suffocating they are.

619
00:36:20,746 --> 00:36:22,180
So come join the circus.

620
00:36:22,214 --> 00:36:23,894
You clearly have a flair
for show business.

621
00:36:25,351 --> 00:36:27,185
Teach me how to appeal
to the highbrows.

622
00:36:28,254 --> 00:36:30,389
- Are you serious?
- Mm-hmm.

623
00:36:30,422 --> 00:36:32,791
Mr. Barnum, I can't just run off
and join the circus.

624
00:36:32,824 --> 00:36:34,793
Why not?
Sounds thrilling, doesn't it?

625
00:36:34,826 --> 00:36:36,771
Let's just say that I find it
much more comfortable

626
00:36:36,795 --> 00:36:38,564
admiring your show from afar.

627
00:36:38,597 --> 00:36:40,232
Comfort, the enemy of progress.

628
00:36:40,266 --> 00:36:42,043
Do you understand that
just associating with you

629
00:36:42,067 --> 00:36:43,669
could cost me my inheritance?

630
00:36:43,702 --> 00:36:45,437
Oh, it could cost you
more than that.

631
00:36:45,471 --> 00:36:47,038
You'd be risking everything.

632
00:36:47,072 --> 00:36:48,807
But, on the other hand, well,

633
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:51,910

Hey, hey! No one's buying hats
back here. Get out front, go!

722
00:41:03,128 --> 00:41:04,730
W.D., Anne, I wanna introduce

723
00:41:04,763 --> 00:41:06,865
my newest hire,
Mr. Phillip Carlyle.

724
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,536
It's a pleasure to meet you.
Yeah, pleasure.

725
00:41:11,837 --> 00:41:13,872
And what is your act,
Mr. Carlyle?

726
00:41:14,573 --> 00:41:16,474
I don't have an act.

727
00:41:17,776 --> 00:41:19,545
Everyone's got an act.

728
00:41:25,283 --> 00:41:26,384
Mr. Barnum!

729
00:41:26,417 --> 00:41:27,786
Yeah.

730
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:30,155
You better come see this.

731
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:33,224
Phillip, keep up!

732
00:41:37,062 --> 00:41:39,364
A bit of a nasty element.

733
00:41:39,397 --> 00:41:40,799
There always is, isn't there?

734
00:41:41,933 --> 00:41:43,702
Nothing draws a crowd
quite like a crowd.

735
00:41:43,735 --> 00:41:45,136
We don't want you in our city!

736
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:47,072
Go home, you freaks!

737
00:41:47,906 --> 00:41:48,674
Freaks!

738
00:41:48,707 --> 00:41:50,141
"Shame of the city."

739
00:41:50,175 --> 00:41:52,678
"The protests cement
Mr. Barnum's reputation

740
00:41:52,711 --> 00:41:55,581
as a purveyor of the offensive
and indecent."

741
00:41:55,614 --> 00:41:59,450
"Offensive and indecent."
Mr. Bennett, I am blushing.

742
00:41:59,484 --> 00:42:02,353
No, I'm blushing.

743
00:42:02,387 --> 00:42:04,055
What do you care
what Bennett thinks?

744
00:42:04,089 --> 00:42:05,991
- He's a prig.
- And a snob.

745
00:42:06,024 --> 00:42:08,159
Yeah, and all the snobs
in New York read him.

746
00:42:08,193 --> 00:42:09,595
He does their thinking for them.

747
00:42:09,628 --> 00:42:12,063
Whatever happened to
thriving off controversy?

748
00:42:12,097 --> 00:42:13,932
Yeah, well...
Hey.

749
00:42:13,965 --> 00:42:15,810
- Do you have any thoughts on this?
- Phillip!

750
00:42:15,834 --> 00:42:18,136
You know what?
As a matter of fact, I do.

751
00:42:18,169 --> 00:42:19,404
Helen, come on.

752
00:42:19,437 --> 00:42:20,706
"The Master of the Household

753
00:42:20,739 --> 00:42:22,608
"has it in command
of the Queen

754
00:42:22,641 --> 00:42:24,576
"to invite
Mr. Phineas T. Barnum

755
00:42:24,610 --> 00:42:25,911
"and his theatrical troupe

756
00:42:25,944 --> 00:42:29,480
to a reception
at Buckingham Palace."

757
00:42:29,514 --> 00:42:32,784
The Queen Victoria?
Is this real?

758
00:42:32,818 --> 00:42:34,753
I had to pull a few strings.

759
00:42:34,786 --> 00:42:37,022
If you want society
to accept you,

760
00:42:37,055 --> 00:42:38,323
you may as well start...

761
00:42:38,356 --> 00:42:41,126
at the very, very top.

762
00:42:42,127 --> 00:42:43,762
Are we all invited?

763
00:42:52,470 --> 00:42:53,881
I guess I'll just
have to tell the Queen

764
00:42:53,905 --> 00:42:55,841
that either all of us go...

765
00:42:56,642 --> 00:42:58,276
or none of us will.

766
00:43:03,114 --> 00:43:06,084
The Queen of England!
Can't get much better than that.

767
00:43:14,392 --> 00:43:15,632
Why aren't we in tails?

768
00:43:15,661 --> 00:43:16,771
We're the entertainment.

769
00:43:16,795 --> 00:43:18,964
Don't see you in a costume.

770
00:43:22,834 --> 00:43:25,671
Your Majesty,
Mr. Phineas T. Barnum...

771
00:43:25,704 --> 00:43:30,608
and his Oddities from America!

772
00:43:34,412 --> 00:43:36,181
Is that real?

773
00:43:49,027 --> 00:43:53,732
Your Majesty.
May I present Mr. Barnum.

774
00:43:53,765 --> 00:43:56,167
The honor is mine, Mr. Barnum.

775
00:43:56,935 --> 00:43:58,269
And I've heard all about

776
00:43:58,303 --> 00:44:01,306
your little colonel from
my friends in America.

777
00:44:02,107 --> 00:44:03,809
General, ma'am.

778
00:44:03,842 --> 00:44:05,643
You're even smaller
than I imagined.

779
00:44:05,677 --> 00:44:07,012
Well, you're not exactly

780
00:44:07,045 --> 00:44:09,047
reaching the top shelf
yourself, sweetheart.

781
00:44:31,602 --> 00:44:32,871
That went well.

782
00:44:34,773 --> 00:44:36,507
Your Majesty.

783
00:44:36,541 --> 00:44:37,843
Phillip.

784
00:44:38,243 --> 00:44:39,945
Miss Jenny Lind.

785
00:44:43,381 --> 00:44:45,984
She is luminous.

786
00:44:48,019 --> 00:44:49,755
Who's that?

787
00:44:49,788 --> 00:44:51,689
The opera singer?

788
00:44:52,357 --> 00:44:53,691
Singer, huh?

789
00:44:54,826 --> 00:44:57,863
She's the most famous performer
in all of Europe.

790
00:44:57,896 --> 00:45:00,565
She's sold out
La Scala a dozen times.

791
00:45:00,598 --> 00:45:03,134
Not to mention
the French Opera.

792
00:45:07,438 --> 00:45:08,706
Ah.

793
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:10,809
What are you doing?

794
00:45:10,842 --> 00:45:12,854
Following you, so you can
introduce me to Miss Lind.

795
00:45:12,878 --> 00:45:14,846
- Introduce you? I don't know her.
- Yeah.

796
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:16,323
Everybody knows her.
You just said so yourself.

797
00:45:16,347 --> 00:45:18,192
Yeah, exactly. You don't just
march up to someone like this.

798
00:45:18,216 --> 00:45:19,951
Why not? We're personable.
She's a person.

799
00:45:23,488 --> 00:45:24,890
Miss Lind.

800
00:45:25,590 --> 00:45:27,325
My name is Phillip Carlyle.

801
00:45:29,294 --> 00:45:32,263
And this extraordinary gentleman
next to me...

802
00:45:32,297 --> 00:45:33,765
Phineas Taylor Barnum.

803
00:45:33,799 --> 00:45:34,900
The pleasure's mine.

804
00:45:34,933 --> 00:45:36,201
Of course,
you are the American.

805
00:45:36,234 --> 00:45:38,970
I believe I might
have heard of you.

806
00:45:39,004 --> 00:45:41,472
Oh, well, if you've heard of me
all the way over here

807
00:45:41,506 --> 00:45:43,541
I must be doing something right.

808
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:45,911
That, or something very wrong.

809
00:45:45,944 --> 00:45:48,814
Well, in the world of publicity,
there's hardly a difference.

810
00:45:48,847 --> 00:45:52,050
I believe those are the words
of a scoundrel, Mr. Barnum.

811
00:45:52,083 --> 00:45:54,886
A showman, Miss Lind,
just a showman.

812
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:57,155
The best on my side
of the Atlantic.

813
00:45:57,188 --> 00:45:59,590
Well, if you do
say so yourself.

814
00:45:59,624 --> 00:46:02,828
I do, but I don't have to.

815
00:46:02,861 --> 00:46:03,895
- Oh, no. No.
- Right?

816
00:46:03,929 --> 00:46:05,897
No, he is one of the best.

817
00:46:05,931 --> 00:46:07,933
Oh, that's very kind of you.
Miss Lind...

818
00:46:07,966 --> 00:46:09,100
let me get to the point.

819
00:46:09,134 --> 00:46:10,535
I'd like to bring you
to New York.

820
00:46:10,568 --> 00:46:12,871
And if you agree, I'll make you
the most famous singer

821
00:46:12,904 --> 00:46:15,073
not in Europe,
but in the entire world.

822
00:46:15,106 --> 00:46:16,707
Mmm.

823
00:46:16,741 --> 00:46:18,910
And have you heard me sing?

824
00:46:18,944 --> 00:46:21,779
Absolutely.
No. No, I haven't.

825
00:46:21,813 --> 00:46:24,582
But like mine,
your reputation precedes you,

826
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:26,517
and, well,
I trust your reputation

827
00:46:26,551 --> 00:46:28,553
more than my own taste, so...

828
00:46:28,586 --> 00:46:31,256
I've never been to America.

829
00:46:31,289 --> 00:46:32,991
You will sing
in the grandest theater

830
00:46:33,024 --> 00:46:35,726
with the finest orchestra
in the greatest city on Earth.

831
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:37,362
"Jenny Lind.

832
00:46:37,395 --> 00:46:38,663
"One night only."

833
00:46:38,696 --> 00:46:39,898
Or maybe two.

834
00:46:39,931 --> 00:46:42,333
And at 20 percent of the gate,

835
00:46:42,367 --> 00:46:44,135
it'll be a queen's ransom
for your efforts.

836
00:46:44,169 --> 00:46:46,504
I give most of my earnings
to charity, Mr. Barnum.

837
00:46:46,537 --> 00:46:47,772
To orphans and widows.

838
00:46:47,805 --> 00:46:50,408
"Voice of a Nightingale,
Heart of an Angel."

839
00:46:50,441 --> 00:46:51,442
That's brilliant.

840
00:46:51,476 --> 00:46:52,954
I mean, the press
will go crazy for that story.

841
00:46:52,978 --> 00:46:54,545
That's not a story.

842
00:46:54,579 --> 00:46:56,547
May I ask you something,
Mr. Barnum?

843
00:46:56,581 --> 00:46:58,016
Anything.

844
00:46:59,350 --> 00:47:00,385
Why me?

845
00:47:02,988 --> 00:47:04,222
People come to my show

846
00:47:04,255 --> 00:47:07,192
for the pleasure
of being hoodwinked.

847
00:47:07,225 --> 00:47:09,594
Just once, I'd love to give them
something real.

848
00:47:16,001 --> 00:47:17,535
Miss Lind.

849
00:47:29,614 --> 00:47:32,417
Everyone is here.
Look at this.

850
00:47:32,450 --> 00:47:34,052
Even the Winthrops.

851
00:47:34,485 --> 00:47:36,154
Are you happy?

852
00:47:36,787 --> 00:47:38,990
I will be if this works.

853
00:47:39,024 --> 00:47:41,893
Oh, God. I hope she can sing.

854
00:47:43,794 --> 00:47:44,972
What's taking her so long?

855
00:47:44,996 --> 00:47:46,697
They're still
taking their seats.

856
00:47:46,731 --> 00:47:47,999
Speaking of which.
Yeah?

857
00:47:48,033 --> 00:47:49,810
Tom and Lettie, the others,
they've just arrived.

858
00:47:49,834 --> 00:47:51,036
What?

859
00:47:51,069 --> 00:47:53,071
Where should I put 'em?
Your box?

860
00:47:53,104 --> 00:47:55,373
That box? No, no, no,
that's a bit visible.

861
00:47:55,406 --> 00:47:56,507
Visible?

862
00:47:56,541 --> 00:47:58,052
The acoustics are actually
better in the standing room.

863
00:47:58,076 --> 00:47:59,277
That's where they should be.

864
00:48:00,678 --> 00:48:01,846
Miss Lind's ready now.

865
00:48:01,879 --> 00:48:03,348
Okay. Thank you, thank God!

866
00:48:05,350 --> 00:48:06,952
This is so awesome.

867
00:48:06,985 --> 00:48:09,220
- Isn't it wonderful?
- Yeah.

868
00:48:09,254 --> 00:48:11,156
- I love it.
- Look at the curtain.

869
00:48:24,502 --> 00:48:27,005
Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you for your patience.

870
00:48:27,038 --> 00:48:28,806
He's out of his element.

871
00:48:28,839 --> 00:48:30,541
What is this about?

872
00:48:30,575 --> 00:48:32,110
Is that Barnum?

873
00:48:32,143 --> 00:48:33,511
This isn't the circus.

874
00:48:34,479 --> 00:48:36,281
I recently had the privilege

875
00:48:36,314 --> 00:48:40,018
of hearing the most
divine voice

876
00:48:40,051 --> 00:48:41,152
I've ever heard.

877
00:48:41,186 --> 00:48:43,021
Suddenly,
he's a connoisseur.

878
00:48:43,054 --> 00:48:46,324
Now, I know that
sounds like Barnum Humbug...

879

another sideshow novelty.

00:52:53,871 --> 00:52:55,240
Wonderful!

00:52:55,873 --> 00:52:57,375

00:52:58,008 --> 00:52:59,344
More!

939
00:52:59,977 --> 00:53:00,977
Excellent!

940
00:53:03,281 --> 00:53:04,349
Brava!

941
00:53:06,451 --> 00:53:07,451
Encore!

942
00:53:11,522 --> 00:53:13,362
Jenny, this is my wife,
Charity, and our girls.

943
00:53:13,391 --> 00:53:15,426
Of course, and I've heard
so much about you!

944
00:53:15,460 --> 00:53:18,263
And your father tells me
you're a fan of the ballet.

945
00:53:18,296 --> 00:53:20,030
Yes, I'm studying ballet.

946
00:53:20,064 --> 00:53:21,599
Are you?

947
00:53:21,632 --> 00:53:24,201
- Of course, I am.
- And, of course, she is.

948
00:53:24,235 --> 00:53:25,336
And what
about you, Helen?

949
00:53:25,370 --> 00:53:26,971
You look like
a princess, ma'am.

950
00:53:28,172 --> 00:53:32,610
I have to admit, Barnum...
she is remarkable.

951
00:53:32,643 --> 00:53:35,346
Enough to bring joy to the most
joyless critic, isn't she?

952
00:53:35,380 --> 00:53:38,683
Mmm. And in the hands of a
real purveyor of the arts,

953
00:53:38,716 --> 00:53:42,019
she could be something in this country.

954
00:53:42,052 --> 00:53:44,121
Shame,
she's fallen in with you.

955
00:53:44,154 --> 00:53:46,090
You really are better
on the page, Mr. Bennett,

956
00:53:46,123 --> 00:53:47,492
hard as that is to believe.

957
00:53:47,525 --> 00:53:48,959
- Mr. Barnum...
- Yes.

958
00:53:48,993 --> 00:53:50,504
- I'd love to meet Miss Lind.
- And you will meet Miss Lind.

959
00:53:50,528 --> 00:53:52,339
- Would you introduce us?
- If you just give me a moment...

960
00:53:52,363 --> 00:53:54,031
- Phineas.
- Yes.

961
00:53:54,064 --> 00:53:55,600
You've...

962
00:53:55,633 --> 00:53:57,435
done well.

963
00:53:59,003 --> 00:54:00,438
Thank you.

964
00:54:03,408 --> 00:54:05,310
Allow me to introduce you.

965
00:54:07,111 --> 00:54:09,414
Uh, excuse me, Jenny.

966
00:54:09,447 --> 00:54:12,116
I'd like you to meet
Charity's parents.

967
00:54:12,149 --> 00:54:13,584
Mr. and Mrs. Hallett.

968
00:54:13,618 --> 00:54:14,819
Ah, pleasure.

969
00:54:14,852 --> 00:54:16,930
- How do you do? Very nice to meet you.
- Good to meet you.

970
00:54:16,954 --> 00:54:19,256
- Mother.
- Hello, dear.

971
00:54:19,290 --> 00:54:22,059
Are these...

972
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:23,794
Yes, those are
your granddaughters.

973
00:54:23,828 --> 00:54:24,962
Phineas, not here.

974
00:54:24,995 --> 00:54:25,963
Not here?

975
00:54:25,996 --> 00:54:27,508
You afraid I'm gonna
embarrass your parents

976
00:54:27,532 --> 00:54:29,534
in front of their fancy friends?

977
00:54:29,567 --> 00:54:31,302
I really don't think
I have that power.

978
00:54:31,336 --> 00:54:33,604
An insignificant man like me

979
00:54:33,638 --> 00:54:37,775
who was clearly destined
to lead an insignificant life.

980
00:54:37,808 --> 00:54:41,011
All that fortune,
and still just the tailor's boy.

981
00:54:42,046 --> 00:54:43,481
Get out.

982
00:54:47,918 --> 00:54:50,621
Well, Phineas...

983
00:54:50,655 --> 00:54:53,391
I believe I told you
that free champagne

984
00:54:53,424 --> 00:54:54,959
is a recipe for disaster.

985
00:54:55,860 --> 00:54:56,994
Charity.

986
00:54:57,027 --> 00:55:00,998
Now would everyone please
raise their glasses? Charity.

987
00:55:01,031 --> 00:55:02,333
To Mr. Barnum...

988
00:55:02,367 --> 00:55:04,134
who has shown
once and for all...

989
00:55:04,168 --> 00:55:06,937
that a man's station
is limited only

990
00:55:06,971 --> 00:55:08,573
by his imagination.

991
00:55:10,408 --> 00:55:12,843
- To Barnum! To Barnum!
- Thank you.

992
00:55:12,877 --> 00:55:13,877
To Mr. Barnum.

993
00:55:17,247 --> 00:55:19,283
Thank you.

994
00:55:19,316 --> 00:55:21,919
It's hard to understand
wealth and privilege

995
00:55:21,952 --> 00:55:23,921
when you're born into it.

996
00:55:25,756 --> 00:55:29,059
I sometimes don't feel
like I belong here.

997
00:55:30,194 --> 00:55:31,762
You?

998
00:55:32,930 --> 00:55:35,566
I was born out of wedlock...

999
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:37,868
and that brought
shame upon my family.

1000
00:55:38,736 --> 00:55:40,671
And life always
manages to remind me

1001
00:55:40,705 --> 00:55:42,082
that I don't deserve
a place in this world.

1002
00:55:42,106 --> 00:55:46,744
And that leaves a hole that
no ovation can ever fill.

1003
00:55:52,683 --> 00:55:53,984
- Mr. Phineas!
- Guys...

1004
00:55:54,018 --> 00:55:55,753
Lord, that lady can sing!

1005
00:55:55,786 --> 00:55:56,654
I know.

1006
00:55:56,687 --> 00:55:58,689
Think she likes a man
in uniform?

1007
00:55:58,723 --> 00:56:00,434
I'm sure she does.
Okay, what are you doing here?

1008
00:56:00,458 --> 00:56:01,992
You got a show
in an hour, okay?

1009
00:56:02,026 --> 00:56:04,037
That's enough time for us to have
at least three drinks, right?

1010
00:56:04,061 --> 00:56:05,195
Come on, let's go.

1011
00:56:05,229 --> 00:56:06,731
- No, no, no. Lettie!
- What?

1012
00:56:06,764 --> 00:56:09,567
It's very crowded in here, okay?
And I can't have you mingling...

1013
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:10,435
Guys!

1014
00:56:10,468 --> 00:56:11,602
Who's gonna pay admission

1015
00:56:11,636 --> 00:56:13,079
if you're out there
for all the world to see?

1016
00:56:13,103 --> 00:56:15,205
- Okay? Have a great show.
- Wait.

1017
00:56:15,239 --> 00:56:17,174
Ladies and gentlemen, a toast!

1018
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:20,110
Jenny, America
may not know it yet...

1019
00:56:20,144 --> 00:56:22,112

Why can't you just put
more shows in New York?

1106
01:00:13,644 --> 01:00:14,821
Why do you need
to tour the country?

1107
01:00:14,845 --> 01:00:17,314
Why did Napoleon
march on Russia?

1108
01:00:17,347 --> 01:00:18,515
Napoleon was defeated.

1109
01:00:18,548 --> 01:00:20,751
Napoleon didn't have
a 60-piece orchestra.

1110
01:00:20,785 --> 01:00:22,219
A 60-piece orchestra?

1111
01:00:22,252 --> 01:00:24,722
Just get the cheapest musicians
you can and watch that.

1112
01:00:24,755 --> 01:00:25,966
We'll still have to board them.

1113
01:00:25,990 --> 01:00:27,200
We'll get married ones,
they can share a bunk.

1114
01:00:27,224 --> 01:00:29,326
O'Malley, that's
Caroline's piggy bank.

1115
01:00:29,359 --> 01:00:32,196
- Custom sets? Fireworks?
- Yeah.

1116
01:00:32,229 --> 01:00:33,630
Inside theaters?

1117
01:00:33,664 --> 01:00:34,965
That's genius.

1118
01:00:34,999 --> 01:00:36,266
No. Hey, P.T...

1119
01:00:36,300 --> 01:00:38,144
These are the most
famous theaters in the country.

1120
01:00:38,168 --> 01:00:40,146
They make you buy the seats
in advance just to book them.

1121
01:00:40,170 --> 01:00:41,538
Yeah. I took out a loan.

1122
01:00:41,571 --> 01:00:44,117
- And we have to pay Jenny in advance?
- It was a large loan. Okay?

1123
01:00:44,141 --> 01:00:45,710
You're not gonna see
a penny of profit

1124
01:00:45,743 --> 01:00:47,211
until your 40th show...

1125
01:00:47,244 --> 01:00:48,378
41st, actually.

1126
01:00:48,412 --> 01:00:49,923
You're risking everything
you've built here.

1127
01:00:49,947 --> 01:00:51,248
How do you think I built it?

1128
01:00:51,281 --> 01:00:53,126
We'll have plenty of profits
to go around after this.

1129
01:00:53,150 --> 01:00:54,084
- P.T.?
- What?

1130
01:00:54,118 --> 01:00:56,420
Your attention has been
divided long enough.

1131
01:00:56,453 --> 01:00:57,554
Our gate is down,

1132
01:00:57,587 --> 01:00:58,956
we have more
protesters every day.

1133
01:00:58,989 --> 01:01:00,366
You just need to get people
to come back.

1134
01:01:00,390 --> 01:01:02,426
"If you haven't been
to the Barnum Museum lately,

1135
01:01:02,459 --> 01:01:03,837
you haven't been
at the Barnum Museum."

1136
01:01:03,861 --> 01:01:05,830
They come to see you.

1137
01:01:05,863 --> 01:01:07,564
Your crazy ideas...

1138
01:01:07,597 --> 01:01:09,834
your new acts, the unusual.

1139
01:01:09,867 --> 01:01:12,669
Then how about you show
them a smile? That'd be unusual.

1140
01:01:12,703 --> 01:01:14,047
Keep rehearsing.
Just make it very clear

1141
01:01:14,071 --> 01:01:16,606
I expect them to afford you
all the deference you deserve

1142
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:19,643
and that they should
be nice to you anyway.

1143
01:01:19,676 --> 01:01:21,912
Ain't that a sight
for sore eyes?

1144
01:01:21,946 --> 01:01:23,480
He couldn't even say "hello."

1145
01:01:23,513 --> 01:01:24,614
Or "goodbye."

1146
01:01:24,648 --> 01:01:27,017
He's going on tour. Sorry, guys.

1147
01:01:27,051 --> 01:01:28,786
Oh, pull yourself
together, Carlyle.

1148
01:01:28,819 --> 01:01:30,755
Don't you have
somewhere to be?

1149
01:01:36,260 --> 01:01:37,527
Anne Wheeler.

1150
01:01:37,561 --> 01:01:40,297
Mr. Barnum said
he left a ticket for me.

1151
01:01:44,568 --> 01:01:45,970
I'm sorry.

1152
01:01:46,003 --> 01:01:47,805
I believe there's only
supposed to be one.

1153
01:01:47,838 --> 01:01:50,240
No, there's meant to be two.

1154
01:01:55,079 --> 01:01:57,815
I wasn't sure
you'd come if I asked.

1155
01:02:01,852 --> 01:02:03,453
Five minutes to curtain.

1156
01:02:06,223 --> 01:02:08,158
I've always wanted
to go to the theater.

1157
01:02:14,799 --> 01:02:16,901
Phillip, is that you?

1158
01:02:18,068 --> 01:02:19,069
Mother.

1159
01:02:19,103 --> 01:02:23,240
Father.
This is Anne Wheeler.

1160
01:02:24,041 --> 01:02:27,244
Phillip, have you no shame?

1161
01:02:27,277 --> 01:02:31,015
Associating yourself with that
Barnum business is one thing...

1162
01:02:31,048 --> 01:02:33,217
but parading around
with the help?

1163
01:02:36,186 --> 01:02:38,055
Anne.

1164
01:02:38,088 --> 01:02:39,423
Anne!

1165
01:02:39,456 --> 01:02:40,757
Anne!

1166
01:02:45,896 --> 01:02:48,065
How dare you speak
to her like that?

1167
01:02:50,534 --> 01:02:52,569
You forget your place, Phillip.

1168
01:02:52,602 --> 01:02:54,604
My place?

1169
01:02:54,638 --> 01:02:56,640
Mother, if this is my place,

1170
01:02:56,673 --> 01:02:58,843
then I don't
want any part of it.

1171
01:03:08,385 --> 01:03:10,020
Anne.

1172
01:03:13,924 --> 01:03:15,960
They're small-minded people.

1173
01:03:22,599 --> 01:03:24,034
Why do you care what they think?

1174
01:03:24,068 --> 01:03:26,236
It's not just them.

1175
01:03:27,171 --> 01:03:29,006

somebody look at you

1176
01:03:29,039 --> 01:03:30,875

First, it was buying a house on
the same street as my parents.

1237
01:07:35,552 --> 01:07:36,720
Then, meeting the Queen.

1238
01:07:36,753 --> 01:07:40,257
Then bringing Jenny Lind,
then my father the other night.

1239
01:07:40,290 --> 01:07:42,526

be enough for you?

1240
01:07:44,027 --> 01:07:46,163
I'm doing this
for Caroline and Helen.

1241
01:07:46,196 --> 01:07:48,232

They have everything.

- I do understand.

1243
01:07:49,866 --> 01:07:51,635
No, you don't understand.

1244
01:07:52,769 --> 01:07:54,471
How could you?

1245
01:07:57,006 --> 01:07:59,443
My father was treated like dirt.

1246
01:07:59,476 --> 01:08:03,980
I was treated like dirt,
and my children will not be.

1247

01:08:24,501 --> 01:08:25,635

the world, haven't I?

I, uh, I should go.

1309
01:12:41,858 --> 01:12:43,693
I've become a distraction.
I'm sorry, Jenny.

1310
01:12:43,727 --> 01:12:45,595
- No.
- You should finish the tour without me.

01:20:11,574 --> 01:20:13,309
Mind you,
I wouldn't call it art.

1405
01:20:14,510 --> 01:20:16,012
Of course not.

1406
01:20:16,045 --> 01:20:17,313
But...

1407
01:20:18,848 --> 01:20:22,818
putting folks of all kinds
on stage with you...

1408
01:20:22,852 --> 01:20:26,755
all colors, shapes, sizes...

1409
01:20:26,789 --> 01:20:29,092
presenting them as equals...

1410
01:20:30,259 --> 01:20:33,762
Why, another critic
might have even called it

1411
01:20:33,796 --> 01:20:36,132
"a celebration of humanity."

1412
01:20:37,800 --> 01:20:39,502
I would've liked that.

1413
01:20:39,535 --> 01:20:41,104
Mmm.

1414
01:20:43,907 --> 01:20:46,109
Well, I hope you'll rebuild.
Hmm.

1415
01:20:47,310 --> 01:20:49,145
I mean, thank God
for Jenny's tour.

1416
01:20:49,178 --> 01:20:51,147
We can borrow off the profits,
we'll be fine.

1417
01:20:51,680 --> 01:20:52,681
You don't know?

1418
01:20:52,715 --> 01:20:54,217
Hmm?

1419
01:21:01,724 --> 01:21:03,326
I'm sorry.

1420
01:21:14,437 --> 01:21:15,704
Charity?

1421
01:21:15,738 --> 01:21:17,340
Oh, God, Charity.

1422
01:21:17,373 --> 01:21:18,774
I don't wanna talk to you.
I am...

1423
01:21:18,807 --> 01:21:20,009
Nothing happened.

1424
01:21:20,043 --> 01:21:21,253
- This is ridiculous.
- Oh, sure. Nothing happened.

1425
01:21:21,277 --> 01:21:22,821
It's on the cover
of every paper in New York.

1426
01:21:22,845 --> 01:21:25,381
Because she orchestrated the photo.
I'm not in love with her!

1427
01:21:25,414 --> 01:21:26,916
Of course you're not.

1428
01:21:26,950 --> 01:21:29,352
Not with her, not with me,
not with anyone.

1429
01:21:29,385 --> 01:21:30,653
Just you and your show.

1430
01:21:33,056 --> 01:21:35,058
What are you doing?

1431
01:21:36,492 --> 01:21:38,327
I'm going home.

1432
01:21:38,361 --> 01:21:39,628
This is your home.

1433
01:21:43,599 --> 01:21:44,968
The bank...

1434
01:21:46,769 --> 01:21:48,371
they're evicting us.

1435
01:21:50,106 --> 01:21:52,541
Why didn't you ask me before...

1436
01:21:54,743 --> 01:21:56,980
I would've said yes.

1437
01:21:57,013 --> 01:22:00,449
I never minded the risk,
but we always did it together.

1438
01:22:38,821 --> 01:22:40,823
Figured you'd end up here.

1439
01:22:40,856 --> 01:22:42,591
Feeling sorry for yourself.

1440
01:22:58,974 --> 01:23:00,609
Folks, if you've
come to get paid,

1441
01:23:00,643 --> 01:23:03,212
the money is gone. All of it.

1442
01:23:03,246 --> 01:23:05,114
- Nothing left to give you.
- Shut up, Barnum.

1443
01:23:05,148 --> 01:23:07,083
You just don't get it.

1444
01:23:08,084 --> 01:23:11,120
Our own mothers
were ashamed of us.

1445
01:23:12,221 --> 01:23:13,756
Hid us our whole lives.

1446
01:23:15,091 --> 01:23:18,161
Then you pull us
out of the shadows.

1447
01:23:18,194 --> 01:23:20,163
And now you're
giving up on us, too.

1448
01:23:21,497 --> 01:23:23,399
Maybe you are a fraud.

1449
01:23:23,432 --> 01:23:26,269
Maybe it was just
about making a buck.

1450
01:23:28,371 --> 01:23:31,474
But you gave us a real family.

1451
01:23:31,507 --> 01:23:35,078
And the circus...
that was our home.

1452
01:23:38,781 --> 01:23:40,516

left in the country

more money, so...

1551
01:31:06,461 --> 01:31:08,063
I'm really sorry
to disappoint you all.

1552
01:31:08,096 --> 01:31:11,534
Don't worry, Barnum.
We've gotten used to it by now.

1553
01:31:11,567 --> 01:31:13,368
You know, Barnum...

1554
01:31:13,401 --> 01:31:15,370
when I first met you...

1555
01:31:15,403 --> 01:31:17,540
I had an inheritance, acclaim,

1556
01:31:17,573 --> 01:31:20,509
an invitation
to every party in town.

1557
01:31:20,543 --> 01:31:24,046
And now, thanks to you,
all that's gone.

1558
01:31:25,614 --> 01:31:26,782
All that's left is

1559
01:31:26,815 --> 01:31:31,219
friendship, love,
and work that I adore.

1560
01:31:33,756 --> 01:31:36,692
You brought joy into my life.

1561
01:31:36,725 --> 01:31:38,827
- Into all our lives.
- Hear, hear.

1562
01:31:40,696 --> 01:31:43,198
If only the bank
would take joy as collateral.

1563
01:31:43,231 --> 01:31:44,767
They may not...

1564
01:31:45,400 --> 01:31:46,935
but I will.

1565
01:31:48,370 --> 01:31:50,238
I own 10% of the show.

1566
01:31:51,907 --> 01:31:53,642
Knowing who I was working for...

1567
01:31:53,676 --> 01:31:56,111
I had the good sense
to take my cut weekly.

1568
01:31:57,913 --> 01:32:00,048
Phillip, I can't let you
gamble it on me.

1569
01:32:00,082 --> 01:32:01,717
Sure you can.

1570
01:32:01,750 --> 01:32:04,186
Don't turn
sensible on us now.

1571
01:32:05,387 --> 01:32:06,822

1572
01:32:08,090 --> 01:32:09,257

1574
01:32:22,871 --> 01:32:24,239
Yeah!

1575
01:32:24,272 --> 01:32:26,041
The only thing is,

1576
01:32:26,074 --> 01:32:28,110
I don't know how
we're gonna afford a building.

1577
01:32:29,544 --> 01:32:31,013
Right.

1578
01:32:34,617 --> 01:32:36,852
Building.
We don't need a building.

1579
01:32:36,885 --> 01:32:39,221
Real estate in Manhattan
