when I get back to the studio.

Then I shall do some charcoal sketches,
studies of the head, the hands

00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:29,640
-America?
-Yes, next month.

171
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:35,400
He's what, four?
Already at the older end of the spectrum.

172
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:40,040
-If you were asking my opinion...
-That is why I asked you here today.

173
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:44,760
My honest advice,
I'd consider retiring him now.

174
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,520
At the top of his game.

175
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:50,640
The best middle distance horse in Europe,
with a sky-high market value.

176
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,120
Let him earn you
some proper money as a stud.

177
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:59,920
I'm surprised to hear you turning down
the opportunity of going to America.

178
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,440
Why?

179
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:04,680
Well, that's where your girlfriend's from,
isn't it?

180
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:09,640
-Fiancé.
-Fiancé? Goodness.

181
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:15,840
Who is she? Money, I hope.
So you can keep up the stables.

182
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,720
-Actually, she's a Portsmouth.
-Oh, dear. So no money.

183
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:23,720
Some money. But horse mad.
Well, she'd have to be.

184
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,280
You'd approve, I think.

185
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:31,360
-Well, can I meet her?
-If you promise you won't scare her.

186
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,560
-Why would I scare her?
-You're the Queen!

187
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:36,080
-Only some of the time.
-All the time.

188
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,560
And that makes you terrifying.
And she's heard a lot about you.

189
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:45,720
-From whom?
-From me. Some of it nice, too.

190
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,560
Oh, the one you let get away.

191
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:28,480
-What?
-He's always carried a torch for you.

192
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:32,000
Porchey? Utter nonsense.

193
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,880
He told me himself.
One night while in his cups.

194
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,880
That doesn't count.

195
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:43,120
When a man's had a drink,
that's when the truth comes out.

196
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:48,200
No. That's when the nonsense comes out.
Besides, we have interests in common.

197
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,960
Horses aren't an interest to you.
They're a passion.

198
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:55,280
-A passion your husband doesn't share.
-He has other passions.

199
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,200
So I hear.

200
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,440
-Sir.
-Good morning.

201
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,320
The Foreign Secretary is here, sir.
Shall I show him in?

202
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,760
No.

203
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,640
Not here.

204
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,640
Sorry to keep you waiting.

205
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,640
As apposite as ever.

206
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,760
I didn't mean it like that.

207
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:05,560
-There's ugliness in the air, Anthony.
-I have nothing of beauty to say.

208
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:10,440
Then say what you must,
deposit your ugliness and go.

209
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:13,160
I have more important things to do.

210
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,520
Very well.

211
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,320
At some point,

212
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:29,400
every leader must ask himself
whether by staying in office,

213
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,680
he is giving to the country,

214
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:35,920
or taking from it. Helping or harming.

215
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:41,080
And I would suggest
that for some time now,

216
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:45,000
you have been taking and harming.

217
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:50,320
And therefore I come to you, in the name
of the party and of the country,

218
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,440
for the very last time, Winston,

219
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:59,120
-to bid you to stand down.
-I will in good time. The right time.

220
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,880
The right time was nine years ago
when you lost us the election.

221
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:06,240
And I have since avenged that defeat
by winning us the last election.

222
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,920
I won us that, Winston! I won that!

223
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:17,680
People voted Conservative
in the clear expectation

224
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,760
-that you would give way to me.
-That is such rubbish!

225
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:24,760
They voted Conservative
because they couldn't stomach socialism!

226
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:27,640
Inflation is out of control.

227
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:32,640
And with every misjudgment,
with every miscalculation,

228
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:37,240
with every utterance you make, that
appetite to return to the left is growing!

229
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,800
Be careful, Anthony,

230
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:42,360
too much excitement is not good
for one so soon after an operation.

231
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:46,160
Spoken by a man who
only two months ago was effectively dead.

232
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,960
-Which makes two of us.
-I have recovered.

233
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:54,880
That's not what I hear. I hear
you are a shadow of your former self.

234
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,120
That when you walk,
the pills rattle around inside of you!

235
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:01,840
I have something
that you will never see again.

236
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:07,200
-A clean bill of health.
-Stalin said the same.

237
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:10,600
He died groveling on the floor!

238
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,080
Mr. Sutherland is here.

239
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:16,680
-Hello, Anthony.
-Anthony was just leaving.

240
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,440
Hello, Clemmie.

241
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Yes, I was... just leaving.

242
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,440
[Sutherland] Here we are.

243
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,400
Morning.

244
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,880
-Morning.
-Sir, this is my wife, Kathleen.

245
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,240
She assists me sometimes.
I hope you don't mind.

246
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,040
Over here.

247
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:17,600
-What's that you're using?
-Pencil.

248
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,040
Yeah. But which kind?

249
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:23,920
4B or 6B, not sure.

250
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,680
[Kathleen] It's a 6B.

251
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,640
-And on what paper?
-[Sutherland] Drawing paper.

252
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,040
[Churchill] I favor heavy-weight cotton,
cold pressed, deckle edged.

253
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,840
Sized with gelatin.

254
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:47,560
How many paintings does your husband
complete in a year, Mrs. Sutherland?

255
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,760
Three or four.

256
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:52,760
Would you care to guess
how many I average?

257
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:57,280
-Ten? 15?
-60!

258
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,080
[Kathleen chuckles]

259
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:03,080
Of course, I'm just a hobbyist,
an enthusiast.

260
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:05,680
Not a major artist like your husband.

261
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,360
[sighs]

262
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:10,200
Taking his time.

263
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,200
Over here.

264
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,280
[Churchill snores]

265
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:46,920
I did a little reading about you,
Mr. Sutherland, after our last session.

266
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,760
-Did you?
-Yeah. Quite interesting.

267
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:53,880
From what I read, this is all
very new to you, this portraiture.

268
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:57,120
I don't think anyone starts out
wanting to be a portraitist.

269
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:01,640
Yeah. But in your search for your métier,
you've tried a bit of everything.

270
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:06,400
That's true.
I came to painting quite late.

271
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,520
And now that you've found it,
you'll never leave it, yes?

272
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,720
Yeah. I quite understand.

273
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:13,360
[Kathleen chuckles]

274
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:31,440
How is it, Mrs. Sutherland?

275
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,000
It has truth.

276
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,600
-Am I to be allowed a peek?
-No.

277
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:42,840
Well, why not? I could give you advice.

278
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:46,760
After all,
I know this face better than you do.

279
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:50,440
If you've made the neck too thick
or the arms too long, I can tell you.

280
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:54,920
I find in general people have
very little understanding of who they are.

281
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,360
One has to turn a blind eye to so much
of oneself in order to get through life.

282
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:01,720
And you see it as your responsibility
to bring all that out into the open?

283
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,320
Certainly. The good as well as the bad.

284
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:06,880
Just concentrate on the good,
and all will be well.

285
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,800
You're not just painting me, you know.

286
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:13,400
You're painting the Prime Minister
of the United Kingdom of Great Britain

287
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:16,520
and Northern Ireland, and everything
that great office represents.

288
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,200
Democracy. Freedom.

289
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:24,160
The highest ideals of government
and leadership. Just remember that.

290
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,720
[phone rings]

291
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:38,040
-Yes?
<i>-Lord Porchester, Your Majesty.</i>

292
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,440
-Thank you.
<i>-Plug in.</i>

293
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:42,760
-Porchey?
-What a palaver.

294
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:45,240
<i>-What is?</i>
-Getting through to you.

295
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:49,440
<i>I picked up the phone to you just after</i>
<i>nine this morning. It's now gone midday.</i>

296
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:53,120
Oh, don't exaggerate.
But, yes, I know, it is infuriating.

297
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,240
Fire away.

298
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:57,120
You asked me to come up with some figures
for you with regard to Aureole.

299
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,360
Although I'm numerically dyslexic,
runs in the family I'm afraid,

300
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,440
like the high forehead.

301
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,880
<i>I have done the sums,</i>
<i>see if this helps you with your decision.</i>

302
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,160
In the course of his lifetime
as a racehorse,

303
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:10,200
Aureole has made you
just over 40,000 pounds.

304
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,960
Goodness.

305
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:15,440
<i>But if you were to put him out to stud,</i>
<i>he could make you far more.</i>

306
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:18,160
<i>He's a recognized champion,</i>
<i>with a top-notch pedigree.</i>

307
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,120
<i>You could stand him at Wolferton Stud</i>
<i>for top dollar.</i>

308
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,960
Well, that's a decision then.

309
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:27,960
Good.

310
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:32,040
And in the meantime,
I'll ask if I can get you a direct line.

311
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:35,240
-To you?
-Yes, to me. Why?

312
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:37,400
Was there anyone else
you wanted to speak to here?

313
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:40,440
-No.
<i>-Good.</i>

314
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,800
What is it, "top dollar?" I need numbers.

315
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:51,400
-400.
-A pop? A shot?

316
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:54,040
Sorry, I'm trying to find a less
onomatopoeic expression for...

317
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,760
-I know what it is.
-A shag.

318
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,120
A cover.

319
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:02,360
-A cover?
-Yes, that's the correct term for...

320
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:05,040
-A horse hump?
-Yes.

321
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:09,360
So, what might you earn then
over the course of the year?

322
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:14,480
Well, in one year alone,
Aureole might cover 40 mares.

323
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:18,600
-Making about 16,000 pounds.
-Good for him.

324
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:23,360
In the course of his lifetime at the stud,
he might sire 500, 600 foals,

325
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,880
making me over 200,000 pounds.

326
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:28,560
Creating an entire generation
of offspring.

327
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,640
-Yes.
-Father to all the foals in our stables.

328
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,440
And any other stable
that could afford him.

329
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,720
Yes.

330
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:39,200
Oh, I see,
so in time, every horse out there

331
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:43,560
could somehow be related to Aureole.

332
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:48,040
-Yes, I suppose so.
-Like old man Carnarvon.

333
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:50,520
Who?

334
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,160
Your friend Porchey's father.

335
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:57,280
-Porchey?
-No, like I said, his father.

336
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:01,080
-Yes, they're both called Porchey.
-Wasn't that the rumor?

337
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:05,160
-What rumor?
-Well, that he'd had so many affairs,

338
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:08,920
an entire generation of
British aristocrats was related to him.

339
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:14,080
An illegitimate "Porchey"
in every great house in the land.

340
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,320
High foreheads everywhere.

341
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,400
-And numerical dyslexia.
-What?

342
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,360
-Nothing.
-What?

343
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,440
Nothing!

344
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,880
-[door opens]
-Michael!

345
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,120
Dear boy!

346
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:39,040
-[Philip] Good night.
-Good night.

347
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:43,160
Let me have a look at you.

348
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,560
-Marvelous.
-Shall we?

349
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,720
Come on. You look beautiful.

350
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,880
-How is he?
-Not too bad, sir. This way.

351
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,840
-Morning.
-Morning.

352
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:49,400
-No wife this time?
-No.

353
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:53,320
I asked her not to come.

354
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:01,720
Since this is to be our final session,
I wanted us to be all alone.

355
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:11,360
-In silence preferably.
-Yes. Yes. I'll be a good boy.

356
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:21,440
[Churchill] I quite understand
the need for concentration.

357
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:26,760
Painting a picture is like
fighting a battle. A bloody battle.

358
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:32,480
In the gladiatorial fight to the death,
the artist either wins or loses.

359
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:37,680
-Are you winning?
-I hope so.

360
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,120
Do you think I'll like it?

361
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:44,920
I think that's possibly too much
to ask for.

362
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,360
But I do take comfort from the fact

363
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:51,040
that your own work
is so honest and revealing.

364
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:54,600
Oh, thank you for the compliment.

365
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:03,880
Well, are there any works
that you're referring to in particular?

366
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:07,440
I was thinking especially
of the Goldfish pond here at Chartwell.

367
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:14,200
-The pond? Why the pond? It's just a pond.
-It's very much more than that.

368
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:17,600
As borne out by the fact that you've
returned to it again and again.

369
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:18,680
More than 20 times.

370
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:22,080
Well, yes,
because it's such a technical challenge.

371
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:26,120
-It eludes me.
-Well, perhaps you elude yourself, sir.

372
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:29,320
That's why it's more revealing
than a self-portrait.

373
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,680
Oh, that's nonsense.

374
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:35,600
It's the water, the play of light.

375
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:40,480
The trickery. The fish, down below.

376
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:42,320
I think all our work
is unintentionally revealing

377
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,840
and I find it especially so
with your pond.

378
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:48,800
Beneath the tranquility and the elegance
and the light playing on the surface,

379
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:52,720
I saw honesty and pain, terrible pain.

380
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:56,560
The framing itself,
indicated to me that you wanted us

381
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:59,440
to see something

382
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:03,320
beneath all the muted colors,
deep down in the water.

383
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:09,960
Terrible despair. Hiding like a Leviathan.
Like a sea monster.

384
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:14,640
-You saw all that?
-Yes, I did.

385
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,160
Perhaps that says more about you than me?

386
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,680
Mm-hmm.

387
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:21,840
Perhaps.

388
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:27,840
May I ask you a question, Mr. Sutherland?

389
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,080
Hmm.

390
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:34,520
It's about one of your paintings.
The one you call "Pastoral."

391
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:38,640
With all that gnarled and twisted wood.

392
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:42,240
Those great ugly dabs of black.

393
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:47,960
I found something malevolent in it.

394
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:49,720
Where did that come from?

395
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:56,160
Well, that's very perceptive.
That was a very dark time. My...

396
00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:02,720
My son, John, passed away,
aged two months.

397
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:10,080
Oh, my. I am sorry.

398
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,480
Yes. Thank you.

399
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,840
-You have five, yes?
-Four.

400
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:41,520
Marigold was the fifth.

401
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:47,840
She left us at age two years, nine months.
Septicemia.

402
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:50,760
I'm so sorry. I had no idea.

403
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:57,080
We settled on the name Marigold,

404
00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:01,560
on account of her wonderful golden curls.

405
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:04,000
The most extraordinary color.

406
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:09,880
Regretfully,
but though perhaps mercifully,

407
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:13,880
I was not present when she died.

408
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:16,960
When I came home, Clemmie...

409
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:21,800
roared like a wounded animal.

410
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:34,720
We bought Chartwell
a year after Marigold died.

411
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,400
That was when I put in the...

412
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,680
the pond.

413
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:10,080
Here.

414
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:13,760
Thank you.

415
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:28,520
Well, thank you.

416
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,440
It was a pleasure.

417
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:39,280
I look forward to seeing it.

418
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:22,200
-Hello.
-Hello.

419
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:24,880
-Shall we?
-Yes.

420
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:31,680
Given this is Aureole's debut,
and we want to leave nothing to chance,

421
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:34,040
I've called up three different mares.

422
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:37,800
Very rarely does a forced tryst
make a fruitful tryst.

423
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,120
If one wants the perfect foal,

424
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,720
one needs to be prepared
to wait for the perfect pairing.

425
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:42,840
Shall we?

426
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:46,160
-Meet Neocracy.
-Oh, the Aga Khan's horse.

427
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,120
-Indeed.
-Yes.

428
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,520
Recently retired
with a good record as a winner.

429
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,880
Lovely temperament, too.

430
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,160
My only concern would be,

431
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:55,640
-is she perhaps a little too...
-Bashful?

432
00:37:56,520 --> 00:38:00,240
I'm worried that if we left these two
to it, nothing would ever happen.

433
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,640
Which is why I've also called up
Turkish Blood.

434
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:06,040
-An altogether different proposition.
-Indeed.

435
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:08,760
Strong, willful,
with a terrific track record herself.

436
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:12,520
It really would be breeding
the best with the best.

437
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,080
I'm sensing a "but".

438
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:17,480
From memory, your Aureole
is something of a sensitive soul.

439
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:20,120
I'd hate him to be intimidated
or come unstuck

440
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:22,240
when faced with a fiery warrior like this.

441
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,960
Very considerate of you, Porchey.

442
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:26,760
Which is why I have a good feeling
about our third candidate.

443

with a winning streak herself.

She's a little on the young side, perhaps.
Just three.

We don't mind that, do we?

447
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:46,320
-Immediate engagement.
-Yes. I must say, I do like this one.

448
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,720
It would appear the feeling is mutual.

I understand you've rejected the painting.

506
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:28,040
-I have.
-On what grounds?

507
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:31,360
That is not a painting.
It's a humiliation!

508
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:35,400
"How shall I paint him today?"

509
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:39,200
"Ah! Sitting on a chair,
producing a stool."

510
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:45,600
"A broken, sagging, pitiful creature,
squeezing and squeezing!"

511
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:49,080
-That's not how it's being seen.
-That is how it is.

512
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:52,840
-And I will not accept it.
-I don't think it's wise to reject it.

513
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:55,640
It was commissioned by the members
of the joint Houses of Parliament

514
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:56,720
as a sign of respect.

515
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:59,840
Well, then they should have commissioned
an artist who is respectful,

516
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:03,600
instead of a Judas
wielding his murderous brush.

517
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:07,800
Look at it!
It is a betrayal of friendship.

518
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:10,400
And an unpatriotic, treacherous,

519
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:14,400
cowardly assault
by the individualistic left.

520
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:17,080
-As regards the friendship...
-Clearly there is none.

521
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:21,760
I accepted this commission
because I admired you

522
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:24,520
and I came through the experience
admiring you even more.

523
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:26,680
You make monsters of everyone you admire?

524
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:32,200
It's not vindictive.
It's art. It's not personal.

525
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:36,440
Well, you are a lost soul.

526
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:38,920
A narcissist without direction
or certainty.

527
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:43,960
Please, sir.
Don't overreact. Give it time.

528
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:46,000
I showed those sketches
to your wife throughout.

529
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:49,040
-She remarked on how accurate they were.
-That is the whole point.

530
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:52,400
It is not a reasonably
truthful image of me!

531
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:55,400
-It is, sir.
-It is not! It is cruel!

532
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:57,400
Age is cruel!

533
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:05,520
If you see decay,
it's because there's decay.

534
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:08,080
If you see frailty,
it's because there's frailty.

535
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:12,040
I can't be blamed for what is.

536
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:17,400
And I refuse to hide
and disguise what I see.

537
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:24,560
If you're engaged in a fight with
something, then it's not with me.

538
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:31,560
It's with your own blindness.

539
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:43,600
I think you should go.

540
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:03,640
[car door slams, engine starts]

541
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:26,280
<i>He's right.</i>

542
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:31,960
-What?
-I am that man in the painting.

543
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:36,640
<i>Wretched and decaying.</i>

544
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:40,800
-I cannot go on.
-You've said that before.

545
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:47,400
<i>This time I mean it. I'm tired.</i>

546
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:52,600
You've had enough?

547
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:56,280
<i>I have, my love.</i>

548
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:02,680
This time I really have.

549
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:05,120
Good.

550
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:47,880
Of course, I knew it was coming.

551
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:53,160
And if I'm being frank,
there were one or two moments

552
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:55,080
when I might have even hoped for it, too.

553
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:57,960
-Prayed, no doubt.
-[chuckles]

554
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:07,880
You really have been the most remarkable
servant to your country.

555
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:12,400
-Thank you, Ma'am.
-No, Winston, on behalf of us all...

556
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:14,720
thank you.

557
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:21,880
-And you wish for Mr. Eden to take over?
-I do.

558
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:24,040
Well, that will make him happy.

559
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:28,880
For a day or two,
he might even stop cursing me.

560
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:33,760
Then he will be overwhelmed by a job
in which no man can ever succeed,

561
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:36,800
and curse me again for leaving it to him.

562
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:41,320
It might be an idea not to tell him that
before he starts.

563
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:42,440
No, Ma'am.

564
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:46,400
So...

565
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:50,440
This is our last audience?

566
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:00,120
Yes.

567
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:06,360
However will I cope without you?

568
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:09,440
You will be fine, Ma'am.

569
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:16,600
I have nothing more to teach you.
Which is why it's time for me to leave.

570
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:27,480
Your Majesty.

571
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:18,320
Stop.

572
00:51:57,840 --> 00:52:01,040
Renaming London Airport?

573
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:04,200
I want something more personal
for Winston.

574
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:08,600
What about dinner?

575
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:11,760
-Here? Or Buckingham Palace?
-No, there.

576
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:13,760
-Downing Street?
-Yes.

577
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:17,640
It would be quite the compliment.
You and Philip go there for dinner.

578
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:20,400
I'll ask Philip.

579
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:23,200
-No, you'll tell Philip.
-Mummy.

580
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:27,120
Dinner? Downing Street?
Oh, God! Why not?

581
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:30,800
Is she a looker, do you think?

582
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:35,440
I mean, if I were a stallion,
would I fancy her?

583
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:39,880
Attraction isn't so much about looks
as smell.

584
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:43,200
-Oh, I see. Well, does she smell good?
-Well, we'll see, won't we?

585
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:46,800
[man] Come on. Come on.

586
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:54,720
Rather like us, darling,
when we were courting.

587
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:57,400
-[man] Gently, gently, come on.
-Shh. Will you please be quiet?

588
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:01,560
-Yeah, look. There we go!
-[man] All right.

589
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:03,320
[man] All right.

590
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:09,200
-[man] Hold her steady.
-Steady.

591
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:11,600
[laughs]

592
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:14,400
[Philip] Oi, oi. I'll say.

593
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:21,080
[man] Back off.

594
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:24,680
-Yes, there we go.
-Good girl.

595
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:26,680
Good boy.

596
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:29,000
[Philip] Is that it?

597
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:33,240
2,000 guineas for that?

598
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:37,160
As long as he's done what he needs to do,
and it bears fruit, I don't mind.

599
00:53:37,240 --> 00:53:39,240
Well done, Porchey!

600
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:45,040
Yes, indeed. Well done, Porchey.

601
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:47,520
I hear he's been given a direct line.

602
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:48,720
-Who?
-Porchey.

603
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:50,400
So he can call straight in.

604
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:52,920
I know only because I tried to
get one for Mike and was refused.

605
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:55,480
Yes.

606
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:57,680
On account of him
not being a family member.

607
00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:00,840
-Porchey is like family.
-Is he?

608
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:03,760
Yes. Part of the furniture.

609
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:08,160
Well, as long as you don't sit on him
anytime soon.

610
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:22,000
-Well, that all seemed to go well.
-Yes, it did, didn't it?

611
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:25,080
Are you all right?

612
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:28,800
Mm.

613
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:55,480
-Can you leave us now, please?
-[woman] Yes, Ma'am.

614
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:14,560
I have nothing to hide from you. Nothing.

615
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:18,920
Porchey is a friend.

616
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:25,720
And yes, there are those
who would have preferred me to marry him.

617
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:28,640
Indeed, marriage with him
might have been easier.

618
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:32,520
Might have even worked better than ours.

619
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:38,240
But to everyone's regret
and frustration...

620
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:42,600
the only person I have ever loved is you.

621
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:49,160
And can you honestly look me in the eye
and say the same?

622
00:55:58,320 --> 00:55:59,360
Can you?

623
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:17,720
Pray silence for Her Majesty, the Queen.

624
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:28,360
My Lords, Ladies and Gentlemen.

625
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:31,400
Dear Winston and Lady Churchill.

626
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:40,280
My confidence in Sir Anthony is complete.

627
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:43,680
And I know he will lead the country
on to great achievements,

628
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:50,640
but it would be useless to pretend
that either he or any of those successors

629
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:53,400
who may one day follow him in office,

630
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:55,600
will ever, for me,

631
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:59,680
be able to hold the place
of my first Prime Minister,

632
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:02,640
to whom my husband and I owe so much.

633
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:08,360
And for whose wise guidance,
during the early years of my reign,

634
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:12,040
I shall always be so profoundly grateful.

635
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:13,280
[others] Hear, hear!

636
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:22,640
I will remember you always
for your magnanimity,

637
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,200
your courage at all times.

638
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:35,120
And for your unfailing humor.

639
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:39,680
Founded in your unrivalled mastery
of the English language.

640
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:48,000
<i>I take comfort from the fact, that</i>
<i>in losing my constitutional adviser...</i>

641
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:52,360
<i>I gain a wise counsellor...</i>

642
00:57:55,480 --> 00:57:58,720
to whom I shall look
for help and support...

643
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:01,680
in the days which lie ahead.

644
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:11,600
-May there be many of them.
-[others] Hear, hear.

645
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:25,720
[applause]

646
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:32,320
[mouthing]
