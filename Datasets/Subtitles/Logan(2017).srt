He makes it sound more brutal<br/>than intended.

1802
02:02:14,447 --> 02:02:17,644
The goal was<br/>not to end mutant kind...

1803

but to control it.

1804
02:02:21,287 --> 02:02:22,345

02:02:22,488 --> 02:02:23,955
we needn't stop perfecting<br/>what we eat and drink.

1806
02:02:24,156 --> 02:02:25,123
