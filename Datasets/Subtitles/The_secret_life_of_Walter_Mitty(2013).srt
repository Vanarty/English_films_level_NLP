1
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,081
Huh?

2
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,044
Hi! Todd Mahar,
eHarmony.

3
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,725
How can I help you today?

4
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:36,487
Hi. I can't seem to leave
a wink for someone.

5
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,880
I don't know,
is my page broken?

6
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,963
Do I maybe have
a broken page, or...

7
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,361
I've never heard
of that, but, okay.

8
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:45,041
You're trying to use your eHarmony
account for the first time?

9
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,367
I am.
Okay.

10
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,841
I'm looking
at your profile.

11
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,042
We have a pretty intricate
matching algorithm.

12
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,090
That's what distinguishes us from
other online dating services.

13
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,401
Yeah, I like that.

14
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,844
Actually, I'm just trying to
leave a wink for one person.

15
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,490
Cheryl Melhoff.

16
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,246
She started in my division
at work about a month ago...

17
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:06,688
and I overheard her near the bagels
saying she was on your site.

18
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,365
Okay, that's unique.

19
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,561
But let me ask you.

20
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,165
You left a lot
of this stuff...

21
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:15,211
like the "Been There, Done That" section,
you left it blank.

22
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,084
Yeah, I think
I skipped it.

23
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,045
Okay, you got to
help me out here, man.

24
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,611
Don't skip stuff.

25
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,200
Okay, well, I haven't
really been

26
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,766
anywhere noteworthy
or mentionable.

27
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:31,729
Have you done anything
noteworthy, mentionable?

28
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,203
Hello, you still there?

29
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,409
Can you hang on
a second?

30
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,242
Go, go, go!
Get out! Get out!

31
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,210
She's gonna blow! Go! Go!

32
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,969
Chips!
Over here!

33
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,120
Chips! Thank you!

34
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,501
How did you know
about the building?

35
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,289
I heard barking,
thought I smelled gas.

36
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,646
I hope it's okay.

37
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,370
I engineered
a prosthesis for Chips

38
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,150
while I was sprinting
down the stairwell.

39
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,640
A little hip-joint
assembly

40
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,882
with a drop-ring lock and
an anterior pelvic band.

41
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,561
God, you're noteworthy!

42
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,929
I just live by the ABC's:
Adventurous, Brave, Creative.

43
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,605
That's everything I want in a man.

44
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,601
My man?

45
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,564
Hey, my man,
you still there?

46
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,926
Hey.

47
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,249
What? Did you pass out or...

48
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,563
No, I just like,
zoned out for a second.

49
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,927
Okay. Do you do that a lot?

50
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,801
Normal amount,
I guess.

51
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:42,446
Yeah, I got
to run. Sorry.

52
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,125
Okay, but
we need a lot more...

53
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,927
Hey .Badday to be late.

54
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,491
We just got acquired.

55
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,369
What?
Yeah, over the weekend.

56
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,648
Walter!
Happy birthday!

57
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,761
Whoo-hoo!

58
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,842
He's 42 years old!

59
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,764
Odessa!
What are you doing here?

60
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,322
Mom made you your
favorite clementine cake.

61
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,130
Aren't you supposed to be
at the retirement place

62
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,645
with her getting the
piano moved in?

63
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,425
Yes, I was there.
It's like halfway done...

64
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:45,324
piano's out of the van, it's on
the street, everything's fine.

65
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,184
But I just got a phone
call about a really

66
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,850
big audition,
so can you go finish it?

67
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,048
No, I can't. I'm late.
Walter, I...

68
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,680
I don't think you're seeing
this from what I need.

69
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:54,966
What do you need?

70
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,327
I need to be
Rizzo in Grease.

71
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,881
I don't understand that.

72
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,281
My audition! Rizzo!
Rizzo?

73
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,448
Rizzo! She's
tough and tender!

74
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,521
Do me a favor, please.

75
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:07,000
Make sure Mom's piano gets moved
in all the way. All right?

76
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,691
Don't go to Rizzo!

77
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:11,491
Oh, thanks, Walter.
Happy birthday!

78
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,563
Guess what?
We just got acquired.

79
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,841
Yeah, I heard.

80
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,200
Yeah, there's gonna
be changes.

81
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,881
Downsizing of us into some kind
of dot-com thing, possibly.

82
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,803
I wonder how this
thing goes down,

83
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,883
how the transition's
gonna play out.

84
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,326
I could probably tell you.

85
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:30,326
Ted Hendricks, managing
director of the transition.

86
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,531
Hey. Tim Naughton.
Sales.

87
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,201
Gary Mannheim,
graphic design.

88
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,170
And what do
you do, cake man?

89
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,641
Oh, uh...

90
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:46,802
The cake's just for today.
I'm not a cake man.

91
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,325
I do...

92
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,720
I deal dirctly...

93
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,246
"Dirctly"?

94
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:56,043
Directly with
LIFE'S photo units...

95
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,242
I'm sorry, I was really
getting into this song

96
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,243
and I stopped
listening to you.

97
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,568
I was saying, you know who
looks good in a beard?

98
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,404
Dumbledore, not you.

99
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,081
Guy?

100
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,327
Guy?

101
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,925
What do you do?

102
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:25,091
I'm a negative
asset manager.

103
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,445
Worth the wait.

104
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,927
Mind over matter

105
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,930
Ted.
Donny.

106
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,444
Feeling tough?
Feeling good.

107
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,682
Well, got to make
some tough calls ahead.

108
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,280
You been here
before, yeah?

109
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,401
Yeah, so this is it, huh?

110
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,289
Yeah, the
"house of pictures."

111
00:08:58,880 --> 00:08:59,881
Hey.

112
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,882
Hi.
How was your weekend?

113
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,441
I had an awesome weekend.

114
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,924
And what did
you do this weekend?

115
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,129
Um... Let's see.

116
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:29,491
I bathed in Arctic
mountain water...

117
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,961
while my Latin lover
recited verse to me.

118
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,929
You slut.
I know.

119
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,004
Actually, I waited for my refrigerator
repairman, who never came.

120
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,491
I'm so sorry.

121
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,681
I'm gonna
call you later.

122
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,801
Okay.

123
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,406
The ice, yes?

124
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,125
She moves like a woman.

125
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,008
I'm Walter. Mitty.

126
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,886
Cheryl. Melhoff.

127
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,326
Where have you been?

128
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,847
Testing the limits
of the human espirit.

129
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,970
I'd like to climb your
hair, test that out.

130
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:07,085
Perhaps I can contact you,
possibly through my poetry falcon.

131
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,560
Poetry falcon.

132
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,721
I like that.

133
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:17,244
Do you think, if I hit him with
a paper clip, would he move?

134
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,447
I don't know.

135
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,681
Do it.

136
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,251
Hello.

137
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,767
I actually threw
a toner box at him once.

138
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,001
Yeah? Did he move?

139
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,650
No, I missed.

140
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,283
That's a great story.

141
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,123
Ground Control
to Major Tom.

142
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,401
Can you hear me,
Major Tom?

143
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,361
Oh!

144
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,531
Wow.

145
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,407
Moving on, as they say.

146
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:51,210
Conference room,
more of these stations here...

147
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,089
where people sort
of do their thing.

148
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,406
Layout's here for...

149
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,370
Morning, Hernando!

150
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,881
There's a new nut
pouch, did you hear?

151
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,845
Yeah. I met him.

152
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,286
We're gonna
be evaluated.

153
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,450
They won't be able to. We do
intricate details back here.

154
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,567
Yeah.

155
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,449
It's tricky.
And bewildering.

156
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,921
I should evaluate you,
you should evaluate me.

157
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,591
I don't think
they'll let us do that.

158
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,687
Just saying.

159
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:33,502
Hey, how long has this neg roll been here...
out in the open?

160
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,247
It says "Sean O'Connell."

161
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,084
It came in this morning.

162
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,130
There's a present, too.
He sent you a present, on your desk.

163
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,724
Sean O'Connell
still shoots on film.

164
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,242
That results for
me in a man crush.

165
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,884
Hey, you want
to mount these?

166
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,201
Seriously?

167
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,640
Sure.

168
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:08,484
Heard rumblings
LIFE'S done, man.

169
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,926
Wanted to say thanks.

170
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:14,166
Take a look inside, a gift for
all the years of hard work.

171
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,165
Sorry about the neg roll.

172
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,729
I spilled some blood on it...

173
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,704
while self-stitching
a gun wound to my abdomen...

174
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,009
but number 25 is my best ever.

175
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,004
The quintessence
of life, I think.

176
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,322
I trust you'll get it
where it needs to go...

177
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,170
you always do.

178
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,601
What did you get?

179
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,205
It's a wallet.

180
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,529
With LIFE'S motto on it.

181
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,286
Here you go.

182
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,563
Where's 25?
It's not there.

183
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:29,204
Hey, we need negative 25.

184
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:32,405
Sean O'Connell
sent a telegram.

185
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,561
An actual telegram.

186
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,688
A 100-year-old dude
came in a little hat.

187
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,286
So there's
a floor meeting.

188
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,890
Bring 25.

189
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,767
It's here somewhere.
We'll find it.

190
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:49,651
Okay, make a contact sheet of
these frames as soon as you can.

191
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,926
And don't say
anything to anyone.

192
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,081
Yeah.

193
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:56,325
I just wanted to inform you
all reluctantly, that...

194
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,331
I guess, just start back
from the beginning.

195
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:08,609
Okay. I just wanted to inform
you all reluctantly...

196
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:12,128
that this month's issue
will be our last.

197
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,841
What?

198
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:14,921
Yeah. What?

199
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,324
This is some bull!

200
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,167
It's sad...

201
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,448
news, for sure.

202
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,122
Now, you're all
valued employees.

203
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:29,921
But as we undergo this
transition to LIFE online...

204
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,650
we wanted to be
candid with you...

205
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:35,327
that some of you will be
determined non-vital employees...

206
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,170
to the new partnership.

207
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,288
And we'll be deciding
which of those positions...

208
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:42,848
will be remaining with us over
the course of the next week.

209
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,050
Also, we feel sad about
that, as you can see.

210
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,601
Now for some good news.

211
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,762
We are very excited...
All right, Don.

212
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:55,728
Ted Hendricks. Managing
director of the transition.

213
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:59,286
Never fun,
this stage.

214
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,922
But we do have ahead of us
the privilege of publishing...

215
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:06,846
what will be the very last
issue of LIFE magazine.

216
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:10,403
And for the final issue,
we just received a telegram.

217
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,527
Come on.

218
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,921
From Sean O'Connell...

219
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,242
who has never,
I'm told, been willing...

220
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,289
to speak with
the executives here.

221
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,010
Well, he broke
his long silence

222
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,764
and shared his
thoughts with us...

223
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,764
through that old man.

224
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,045
Sean O'Connell.

225
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:32,967
"I expect full consideration
of negative 25 for cover.

226
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,805
"My most grand.

227
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:38,328
"The quintessence of life."

228
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,806
What is that?

229
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,443
It means like the
fullest and most rich.

230
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,921
Okay. So our cover will probably
be the most famous ever...

231
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:49,562
because it really will have the
big quintessence of all time.

232
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:52,969
Very full and so rich.

233
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,370
So let's see this thing. Huh?

234
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,891
Let's see it.

235
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,771
Can we... What am I doing up here?
What's going on?

236
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,365
We'll receive it now
from Negative Assets.

237
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:04,800
This gentleman.
The last man in.

238
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,126
Negative Assets.
What's that?

239
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,361
Ah, Major Tom.

240
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,601
Can I get that?

241
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,289
It's being processed.

242
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,321
All right. Well,
let's do it.

243
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,847
Let's process
some quintessence.

244
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,241
Come on.

245
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,081
Go.

246
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:24,681
Now.

247
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,285
That's why I'm clapping.

248
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,408
When do we go to press?
Two and a half weeks.

249
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,361
Hi.

250
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,841
Hi.

251
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,648
I'm Walter.

252
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,208
Cheryl. Melhoff. Mitty.

253
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,687
Yes.

254
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,003
You work in Photo Accounts, right?
I do.

255
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,281
Negative Assets.

256
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,771
Yes. Lam.

257
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:01,764
You're processing the last cover photo.
That's a big deal.

258
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,810
Yeah, it's... there's a...
we have a glitch.

259
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,445
Mini, on that
one right now.

260
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,170
I wanted to say,
to you...

261
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:12,885
do you maybe have an address
for Sean O'Connell?

262
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:16,127
Um... It's not really
that easy with him.

263
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,884
He moves around
so much. I don't.

264
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,280
Yeah, he's on a freelance.

265
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:22,205
I don't know where and
he doesn't have a phone.

266
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:24,840
No phone? He's old school. Yeah.

267
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,889
But, you know, why don't
I check with Peg?

268
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,849
I know she just processed
a check for him.

269
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,810
And we could track his pay-out maybe.
Find him that way?

270
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:38,290
Cool. Very cool.
Okay.

271
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,044
Walter.
Yes.

272
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,526
I'm on it.

273
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,841
Thanks.

274
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,121
Yes. Are you coming?

275
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,805
Yes, I'm not.

276
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,083
Yes, I have
to stay.

277
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,520
Here's the
contact sheet.

278
00:17:58,560 --> 00:17:59,800
What do you see?

279
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:02,088
This photo cluster.
These three.

280
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,969
They're the only
printable ones.

281
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:06,248
He took them around the
same time he took 25.

282
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,966
They could give us a clue
to where Sean is.

283
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,121
Blow them up,
all right?

284
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,241
Cool.

285
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,204
Hey.

286
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,090
Walter, right?

287
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,041
Yeah.

288
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:37,284
So, I called Peg about Sean.
She's gonna get back to me.

289
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,051
Oh! Hey, thanks.

290
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,361
Cool glasses,
very Sand People.

291
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,801
These? No,
these are loupes.

292
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,564
They're for work.
They magnify the...

293
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,722
Is that 25? Can I see?

294
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:50,961
That's... No.

295
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,604
I can't quite
find 25...

296
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,285
just now.

297
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,930
You can't find it?

298
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,889
Yeah. That's why
I'm trying to find Sean.

299
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:04,250
I'm trying to track him down
somehow with these other images.

300
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,401
His whereabouts?

301
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:07,721
Yeah.

302
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:12,246
I take this class,
Writing the Mystery Novel.

303
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,922
Anyway, they say the key
is to work backwards.

304
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:18,482
You connect the clues and then
scatter them so they seem unrelated.

305
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,404
There's like a whole
science to it.

306
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,565
May I?
Sure.

307
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,762
Okay. Thumb.

308
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,766
Yeah. It's an
unknown thumb.

309
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,843
Okay. Water?

310
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,286
Just water, I guess?

311
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,527
Yeah, just water.

312
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,687
Okay.

313
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,171
And...

314
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:41,206
like a curved piece of...

315
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:45,160
some kind of, part of a thing.

316
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,442
But the thing with clues,
my teacher says...

317
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,226
is you really only need one good one,
and then they'll connect...

318
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:55,045
and you'll be like, "Oh, yes,
of course, unknown thumb, water...

319
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,521
"I should have seen this
the whole time. Ahh!"

320
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:01,010
Yeah, yeah,
I'll be like...

321
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:09,170
Well, anyway, I should get
back and try not to get fired.

322
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,121
Hey, Cheryl.

323
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,560
I have something creative
I've been working on, too.

324
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,641
Oh.

325
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,610
Little side project.

326
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,403
Walter, it's amazing!

327
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,405
Walter?

328
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:34,927
I was just saying I'll let you know
when I hear back from Peg.

329
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,563
Okay. Thank you.

330
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,001
Okay.

331
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,720
Hey, Odessa.

332
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,406
What?

333
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:02,049
Is there a larger apartment
available the piano could fit in?

334
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,561
Because it's a memento
of our mom's.

335
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,848
That's a really big...

336
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,330
Most people sell their really big
mementos before they move here.

337
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,801
My dad bought it for her
the year they were married.

338
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,162
It means a lot to her.

339
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,083
That's a villa.
It's a little more costly...

340
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,687
but it has a more generous, piano kind
of size living room for you though.

341
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,245
Yeah. Yeah,
this is good.

342
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,746
On move-in,
you'd need first month's,

343
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,061
last month's,
and full deposit.

344
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,884
That's $4,700.
Great.

345
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,247
Yeah, okay.

346
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,731
Yeah, we'll take it.
I'll get the paperwork.

347
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,928
The new villa comes
open in three weeks.

348
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,206
I'm guessing.

349
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,127
Happy birthday.

350
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:42,041
Stretch Armstrong!

351
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,486
That's cool.

352
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,886
Yeah. Isn't
that awesome?

353
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:47,646
This was your favorite thing when
we were little. Do you remember?

354
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,040
You want to do it?

355
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,241
Yeah, all right.

356
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,165
Come on, Stretch!
Good, good!

357
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:54,321
Come on, we got to go.

358
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,404
A villa, okay, but hey, I'm
not the Queen of Sheba.

359
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,999
You got to have
room for your piano.

360
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,511
You can stay at my place
until it's ready.

361
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,562
I won't be cramping
your scene?

362
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,085
My scene? No.

363
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,024
And sorry we couldn't
get you in here today.

364
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,081
Walter!

365
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:09,242
Look what I found!

366
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,687
This is from you
and Tim Linderman.

367
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,081
Do you remember, we were
gonna backpack Europe?

368
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,605
That June Dad died?

369
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,967
Man! What is in here?

370
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,281
That's my Walter box.

371
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,960
Some of my Walter
knick-knacks and keepsakes.

372
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,408
You made the
best mix tapes!

373
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,087
Oh, man.
What? What's that?

374
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,448
Travel journal Dad gave me.

375
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:30,561
Oh.

376
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:33,565
You should donate that, because
you never used it, to a poor kid.

377
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,722
A poor kid who's
gonna travel to Europe?

378
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,723
Look at you
and your dad!

379
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:38,961
Is that my
tournament one?

380
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,929
He was so proud of this.

381
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,321
Sharing your accomplishments
with the whole world.

382
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,802
It's from the
<i>Fairview Smalltowner,</i> Mom.

383
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:50,611
Well, I really
liked that nifty mohawk.

384
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,400
You know, when
your daddy died...

385
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,647
and then you went to work
in that pizza place...

386
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:58,282
the one that was named after a father,
had that father kind of name.

387
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,361
Papa John's.

388
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,447
Yeah, delivery.

389
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:03,444
And I thought perhaps that
it was really sad for you...

390
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,363
working in a restaurant
named after a father

391
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,124
after your father just died.

392
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,890
I never even
thought about that.

393
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,929
Probably because
I didn't call Dad "Papa."

394
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,645
You had a weird style.

395
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:17,246
That wasn't my style.
That was a uniform. KFC.

396
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,565
My worker bee.

397
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,640
"Word in the water"?

398
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:26,444
Okay, you know what?
I got to go.

399
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,602
We're getting you into
a villa situation, okay?

400
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:29,961
Okay.
Good, everybody?

401
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,167
My worker bee...

402
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:33,184
and my performance artist bee!
Thank you, Mom.

403
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,165
Hernando.
Hey.

404
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,685
I don't see anything.
Upper middle.

405
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,683
It's faint. There's a
word in the water.

406
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,009
I'm getting
nervous, Walter.

407
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,965
Hey, this is an ocean.

408
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,685
That's a boat.

409
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,649
"Erkigsnek."

410
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,962
He was near this boat.

411
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,321
See you in a few.

412
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,720
I'll check the mailroom.

413
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,731
Final cover.

414
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,204
Big responsibility.

415
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:21,806
Oh, is that
my quintessence?

416
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,770
No.

417
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:27,786
We're prepping the wetting agents
on that to start the process.

418
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,571
Really? Because it looks like
you're playing with toys.

419
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,410
No, this is a gift.

420
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,742
Yeah, the negative needs to go
through a very technical...

421
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,644
I'm sorry. I can't have a
professional conversation with you.

422
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:42,451
You and your
little blonde pal.

423
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:44,761
Let's...

424
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,768
You can't walk through
the office with him.

425
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,724
Let's have it.
I'll put it away.

426
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:52,170
Give me the toy, man!
No!

427
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,606
Now.

428
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:57,202
This is a place of business,
not a place of jelly-man toys!

429
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,407
Get off it!

430
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,601
No, I'm taking it!

431
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,125
You can't just
take my stuff!

432
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,930
It's mine!
Give it to me!

433
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,081
No!

434
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:20,443
Stop fiddling with sweets
and little men!

435
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:23,046
I'm trying to do my job!

436
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:25,129
Are you the Tin Man?

437
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,962
Need a little oil can?

438
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:29,727
Jesus.

439
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,766
Picture.

440
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,404
Hello?
Hey!

441
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,849
Hey.
What's up?

442
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,291
Who is this?
Todd.

443
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,441
From eHarmony.

444
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,726
Oh! Hi.

445
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,181
When I lost you there,
I was saying...

446
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,244
we need to beef your profile up,
make it, you know, not blank.

447
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,880
Real quick, let's build your
"Been There, Done Thats."

448
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:58,887
Okay. Been there...

449
00:26:58,960 --> 00:26:59,961
Um...

450
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,811
Phoenix.

451
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,450
I forgot why.

452
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,687
Then Nashville...

453
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,001
but that was just
the airport on the way

454
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,600
to Phoenix,
so I don't know if that...

455
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,641
Uh-huh...

456
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:11,889
Hey, man, I was thinking,
if you work with this girl...

457
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:15,681
why don't you just
humanly invite her out?

458
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:18,611
No, no, no, I'm trying to do
like a "Pina Colada Song" thing.

459
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:19,921
"Pina Colada Song"?

460
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,262
Yeah, you know, a guy posts an ad,
looking for a lover...

461
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,560
and then his
wife answers it...

462
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:26,041
and it turns out they were soul
mates and didn't even know it...

463
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:29,443
and they end up making love
in capes, or on a cape.

464
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,251
It's a song? Can you
sing a little bit?

465
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:35,927
If you like pina coladas,
getting caught in the rain

466
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,261
You know that song?
I have to go.

467
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,361
Is that Hall & Oates?

468
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,409
Hey!
Hey.

469
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:41,721
Is that another clue?

470
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,370
Yeah. This one's okay.
Yeah?

471
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:46,008
There's a boat
there, I think.

472
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,767
"Erkig..."
Snek.

473
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,251
Erkigsnek?
Yeah.

474
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,526
Sounds like a real clue.

475
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,091
Yeah, it's the
boat's name.

476
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,401
Have you Googled it?

477
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:55,601
I was on my way to.

478
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,011
Yeah. N-U.

479
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:01,130
It's the first two letters
of the port city.

480
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:04,080
Buffering.

481
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,200
So, the park...

482
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,124
I got to run up there
and pick up my son.

483
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:11,123
He's skateboarding
with a friend.

484
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:13,487
Do you want to walk
up with me?

485
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,041
Starting now?

486
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,486
Yeah, starting now.

487
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,846
Okay.

488
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,650
Yeah, we got to figure this out.
It's a big deal.

489
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,524
You lost a
Sean O'Connell.

490
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,044
I used to work
at Nabisco.

491
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:29,524
And then,
I had a change...

492
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:32,001
and I decided
to apply to LIFE.

493
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:35,642
Thought it would be more
colorful, less regular, I guess.

494
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:38,371
You know, I just like
the idea of it.

495
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,170
I like the motto
of the company.

496
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,646
Do you know it?

497
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:43,881
"To see the world...

498
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:46,361
"Things dangerous
to come to...

499
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,885
"To see behind walls."

500
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,491
Yeah, I...

501
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:53,008
I got this, from Sean.

502
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,527
He gave this to you?

503
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,886
Yeah.

504
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,322
I like that,
"TO DRAW CLOSER."

505
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,688
So, what's he like in person?

506
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,001
Sean?
Yeah.

507
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,686
Well, I haven't
actually met him.

508
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,683
I mean, we talk
a lot, but...

509
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:15,844
I've been his point guy here
ever since I started.

510
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,525
How long ago was that?

511
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,001
16 years.

512
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,286
16 years?

513
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,885
Oh, my gosh. Wow.

514
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,371
Well, you have
nothing to worry about.

515
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:26,010
With the layoffs,
I mean.

516
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,123
I've been here
for a month.

517
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:30,282
"Last in, first out," right?

518
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:32,361
Oh. Sorry.

519
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:36,569
It's Rich's dad.

520
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,885
It's your..

521
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:41,930
Former.
Newly former.

522
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,924
But we've been sort of...
I don't know.

523
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:46,525
I don't need to get it.

524
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:52,571
So, what kind of skateboard
does your son have?

525
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,250
Um, I have no idea!

526
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,568
It's oblong.
I don't know.

527
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:00,041
Why?
No, I just...

528
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:04,565
I used to... I was kind
of into the scene.

529
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,731
The skateboard scene?
Yeah.

530
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,047
Wow!

531
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,125
Hi, Peg.

532
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:13,409
Yeah, it's Sean O'Connell,
we actually need to find him.

533
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:18,087
Yes. If you could hurry.

534
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:19,806
Kickflip.

535
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,320
Yeah.

536
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,484
It's a good one
for the repertoire.

537
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:25,965
I'm Walter.

538
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:27,167
Rich.

539
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,900
Yeah, we think he might know
something or have an asset we need.

540
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,450
You know, you just got to get
a little more snap...

541
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:33,085
get that thing up there.

542
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,004
Want me to show
you something?

543
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,244
Sure.

544
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:41,281
Here.

545
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,487
I like your trucks.

546
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,841
Thanks.

547
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,605
Now check this out.

548
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,364
Know about the flick?
Uh-huh.

549
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:54,923
Yeah, we've finished processing
his April work order.

550
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,608
Yes, it's kind
of important.

551
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:09,410
Did you forward
the job 1090s?

552
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,764
Or his last salary?

553
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,121
Wow!

554
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,086
Wow!

555
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,931
Here you go.
That was awesome.

556
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:22,227
So it could be
either place.

557
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,930
Thanks, Walter.
Okay. Thanks, Peg.

558
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,081
All right.

559
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,641
Hey, so...

560
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,484
Sean's definitely
not in New York.

561
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,210
Peg said she
sent multiples.

562
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,362
I don't know if you know
how it works with him.

563
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:36,364
She sends copies because we
never know where he's gonna be.

564
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:39,603
And this week she sent 1090s
to Princeton, New Jersey.

565
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,763
Oh, great.
Train ride.

566
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,485
And one to Greenland.

567
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:44,641
Just in case.

568
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:47,164
Greenland, the country?

569
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,281
That's...

570
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,011
You can't take
a train there.

571
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,361
No.

572
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:55,363
Well, maybe he's in Jersey.
Yeah.

573
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:58,330
Yeah, is your phone done
buffering with that ship's name?

574
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:00,568
Yes! Look.
Here it is.

575
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,882
Nuuk, Greenland.

576
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,764
Yeah!

577
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,001
Come on, that's
a good lead!

578
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:09,003
You should
follow that up.

579
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,842
Yeah, follow it
up in Greenland.

580
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,207
Yeah. Why not? Go!

581
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:15,850
Crack the case.

582
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,570
Listen to your wallet.

583
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:23,969
Sorry, it's my...
it's Phil again.

584
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:26,646
Maybe he fell down a well or something.
Maybe I should get it.

585
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:27,921
Hey, buddy! Here!

586
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,889
Rich, Rich! Not
so fast! Here!

587
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:31,201
Take that.

588
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,889
Yeah. I understand.

589
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,010
Okay. Bye.

590
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,844
He did fall
down a well.

591
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:41,925
But I don't care.

592
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,526
I just want to be
with you, you know?

593
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:45,761
Really?

594
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:49,208
Let's run away together. Let's make
every moment count, starting now.

595
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,441
Sweet!

596
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:52,881
Can I tell you something?

597
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,007
Anything.

598
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:58,202
I have that
Benjamin Buttons thing.

599
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:01,122
Where you get old,
but smaller.

600
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:04,363
Or whatever, and become a gradual old baby.
Or something.

601
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:07,126
I didn't see the movie, so I
don't really know how it works.

602
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:08,520
But I have it.

603
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,522
We can still
build a life together.

604
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:13,121
Cool.

605
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:29,280
I like your
snappy little suit.

606
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,967
I bought it at
a doll store.

607
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,606
Oh. CooL

608
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:38,888
My little heart is no
bigger than a quarter...

609
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:42,485
but it's as full
as Fort Knox.

610
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:45,607
You're the bravest
man I've ever known.

611
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,449
I love you, baby.

612
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:51,251
Not like "baby," like...

613
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:55,246
because you look like a
little weird baby-man.

614
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,606
I get it.

615
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:00,805
Thank you for such
a wonderful life.

616
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,964
Just nestle in here and die.

617
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:12,808
Good-bye, Walter.

618
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,771
Good-bye! Walter!

619
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:17,808
Walter!
Walter!

620
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,166
Bye!
Oh!

621
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,651
Sorry! I was just...

622
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,764
Where do you go?

623
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,809
I started thinking about...

624
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,761
No, it's okay, I was probably boring
you about my broken refrigerator.

625
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:28,801
No!

626
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:30,447
Rich!

627
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:32,887
My son's running into the street.
I have to go.

628
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,485
Yeah.

629
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:37,883
I wanted to tell you,
that song, "Major Tom"?

630
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:40,725
Back there, when
the beard guy was...

631
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:42,846
He doesn't know what
he's talking about.

632
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:47,050
That song is about courage
and going into the unknown.

633
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,126
It's a cool song.

634
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,565
Rich!

635
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:05,681
Yo!

636
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:08,648
Where's my thing?

637
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:11,047
It's in a silver bath.

638
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,208
I don't even know what language
you're speaking right now.

639
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:16,169
You know, you got
to take me seriously.

640
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,368
I got a magazine
to execute here.

641
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:20,363
And bosses to answer to.

642
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:23,490
So next time I see you,
I see that picture. Okay?

643
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:26,206
Hey! Dream Machine!

644
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,361
Hello?

645
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,203
I want proof
you heard me.

646
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,729
Next time I see you...

647
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:36,366
You see the picture.

648
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:38,729
That's right!

649
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:47,242
Any luck, Hernando?

650
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:50,051
I turned the place upside-down.
25 is not here.

651
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,611
I searched Receiving,
too, man.

652
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:55,082
This never happens!

653
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,050
I'm telling you...

654
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,440
it's nowhere, Walter.

655
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:03,563
I mean, maybe he
didn't even send it.

656
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,804
Maybe it's still on him.

657
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:08,926
Walter?

658
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,765
Walter!

659
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:11,322
Something filled up

660
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:18,840
My heart with nothing

661
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:27,684
Someone told me not to cry

662
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:38,883
Now that I'm older

663
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:46,049
My heart's colder

664
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:55,084
And I can see that it's a lie

665
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:36,641
Hi.

666
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,081
Hi.

667
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,925
Do you have any
cars available?

668
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:45,760
Yeah, we have a blue one
and a red one.

669
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,724
I'll take the red one.

670
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:40,646
You were working
as a waitress in a cocktail bar

671
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,804
When I met you

672
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:48,170
I picked you out, I shook you up
and turned you around

673
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:51,523
Turned you into someone new

674
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:53,690
Hi.
Hi.

675
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:57,970
Can I ask you, could
someone receive mail here?

676
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,288
An American?
Sean O'Connell?

677
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:03,171
I think he might have received
mail at this address.

678
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:05,762
You want a drink?

679
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,204
Okay. Yeah, I guess...

680
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:13,124
a small beer shoe.

681
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,488
So, could somebody
get mail here?

682
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:16,761
Heli mail.

683
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:17,881
"Heli mail"?

684
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:21,329
We helicopter mail to the
ships when they pass by.

685
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:23,648
We are pub and helipad.

686
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:26,241
Yeah. Wait,
the Erkigsnek?

687
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:27,851
Yeah. Erkigsnek.

688
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,126
Erkigsnek.

689
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,682
We flew mail
to her Tuesday.

690
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,526
I'm gonna take it
down a little, here.

691
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:36,523
I just want to
speak from the heart.

692
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,524
I lost a good lady.

693
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:42,010
I feel this song is helping me
feel like I'm not alone.

694
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,963
Even though
I pretty much am.

695
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,281
Come on, let's sing it.

696
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:49,051
Everyone.

697
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,441
Let's sing it together.

698
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,807
Don't you want me, baby?

699
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,883
Do you know who
flies the mail out?

700
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,963
Do you have
regular pilots?

701
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,041
Hey, man.

702
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:59,849
Just keep it going, man.

703
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,240
Hey.
Sing it.

704
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:03,801
No, no, thank you.
I'm all right.

705
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,450
Come on, man. Go on.

706
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,443
I was working
as a waitress

707
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:10,331
Yeah, I know it.
I'm okay. Thank you.

708
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,528
I'm on a business trip,
I'm working.

709
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:14,648
Come on, man. This song
is important to me.

710
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:16,847
Yeah.
Yeah.

711
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:17,967
Sing it.
Okay.

712
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:22,848
I was working as a waitress
in a cocktail bar, That much is true

713
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:23,967
Okay?

714
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,851
That sucked.

715
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,007
Do your work.

716
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:28,081
You don't have to push.

717
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:31,043
What if I poke you?
Don't poke me.

718
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:33,205
Do your work, man.
Don't poke me!

719
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,885
I'm poking you.
What am I doing?

720
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,929
Stop poking me!
Don't poke me!

721
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:41,647
Hey!

722
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:44,881
Come on!

723
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:46,441
Aah!

724
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:51,771
Wait, wait.
Wait!

725
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:54,388
Your thumb! I have to talk
to you about your thumb!

726
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:02,208
MAN: Yeah. I flew mail out
to the <i>Erkigsnek</i> Tuesday.

727
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:04,767
Gave him a ride.

728
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:08,083
He took that photo
of my hand on the stick.

729
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:13,131
I'm just blown away
I located your thumb.

730
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:17,280
There is, like, eight
people in Greenland.

731
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,288
I mean, it's a good
place to find a thumb.

732
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:28,646
Don't cheat on
your lady, man...

733
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:31,804
when you live in a country that
only has eight people in it.

734
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:33,725
By the way.

735
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:35,601
So, uh...

736
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:38,126
You're scrappy.

737
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:42,804
You're a little
scrappy Duncan.

738
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:45,324
So, you're trying
to find this guy?

739
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:46,891
Yes. Yeah.

740
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:50,927
Well, I'm flying some radio parts
out there in five minutes.

741
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:56,166
He may still be
on the boat.

742
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:57,727
Really?
Yeah.

743
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:01,805
Maybe you could
come with me.

744
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:13,531
Yeah, or maybe I could just
call him on the boat phone.

745
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:16,124
The boat phone?

746
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:18,482
Yeah, the phone
on the boat.

747
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:21,371
You mean the
ship-to-shore?

748
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:25,002
Yeah, maybe I could just ask
him on the ship-to-shore.

749
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:27,368
Their radio is broke.

750
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:30,364
That's why I'm
flying out there now.

751
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:31,801
Oh.

752
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:34,049
You're flying
out right now?

753
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:35,646
I'm just gonna
finish my beer.

754
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:37,205
The weather doesn't
look so great.

755
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:38,361
It's not.

756
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:40,571
Looks like there's
a storm moving in.

757
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:42,881
Yeah.

758
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:44,246
A-brewin'.

759
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:45,970
Yeah.

760
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:47,201
But you're just...

761
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:49,647
you're just gonna
finish your beer...

762
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:53,009
and then fly a machine?

763
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:57,165
Yeah.

764
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:00,561
I'm kind of nervous
about the storm.

765
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:04,684
I just want to get
a couple of beers down.

766
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:16,446
Okay. I'm not gonna
go with you.

767
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:19,206
Yeah.

768
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:22,410
Whatever.

769
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:28,605
See you, man.
Okay.

770
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:29,841
See you.

771
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:33,245
Okay.

772
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:02,801
Shut up!

773
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:19,966
Hi. Hello, everyone.

774
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:21,890
Hi. Uh...

775
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:23,849
Hello, Nuuk.

776
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:27,921
Sorry, I'm a little nervous.

777
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:29,847
Okay.

778
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:33,208
This one goes out
to Walter Mitty.

779
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:35,089
He knows why.

780
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:49,205
Ground Control
to Major Tom

781
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:56,601
Ground Control to Major Tom

782
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:05,690
Take your protein pills
And put your helmet on

783
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:25,363
Ground Control to Major Tom

784
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:32,362
Commencing countdown,
engines on

785
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:36,725
Check ignition

786
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:40,851
And may God's
love be with you

787
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:56,201
This is Ground Control
to Major Tom

788
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:00,727
You've really made the grade

789
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:07,604
And the papers want to know
whose shirts you wear

790
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:14,484
Now it's time to leave
the capsule if you dare

791
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:21,005
This is Major Tom
to Ground Control

792
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:25,851
I'm stepping through the door

793
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:31,846
And I'm floating
in the most peculiar way

794
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:38,768
And the stars look
very different today

795
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:47,129
For here am I
sitting in a tin can

796
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:54,443
Far above the world

797
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:01,689
Planet Earth is blue
and there's nothing I can do

798
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:03,086
Hey.

799
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:05,530
Glad you came.

800
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:07,649
Are you comfortable?

801
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:08,847
What?

802
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:10,485
Are you comfortable?

803
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:11,971
No!

804
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:13,724
Hold on tight.

805
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:21,202
Hey, there she is!

806
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:39,002
Where do we land?

807
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:41,003
We don't!

808
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:42,161
What?

809
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:44,011
We don't land.

810
00:48:57,120 --> 00:48:58,849
Okay, Walter.

811
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:01,691
I was gonna drop the radio
parts into the boat.

812
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:04,207
You take them.
They're right next to you.

813
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:10,041
These?
Yeah.

814
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:12,362
Just jump in the boat.
You got them?

815
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:14,728
Just jump in the boat?
Yeah.

816
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:17,244
Yeah, you're doing
great, Walter!

817
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:19,801
What do you mean,
"jump into the boat"?

818
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:23,929
What would be the best way of
reaching you to stay in touch?

819
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:26,405
I don't know. Wait!

820
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:28,562
What do you mean
"jump into the boat"?

821
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:30,731
It looks far away!

822
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:32,325
Yeah, but you
got to go now!

823
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:33,641
Go, go, go!

824
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:35,447
Go!

825
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:38,281
No!

826
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:41,881
No, Walter!

827
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:44,731
I meant the other boat!
The little boat!

828
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:55,160
Help!

829
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:01,921
Help! Help!

830
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:03,764
Try to remain calm.

831
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:06,651
The pontoon boat
is coming for you.

832
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:09,971
You have at least a minute
before you freeze!

833
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:11,041
What?

834
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:12,241
You are safe!

835
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:21,403
There's something here!

836
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:24,606
There's a fin
here, I think!

837
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:27,651
We are traveling through
a porpoise school!

838
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:30,122
Don't fear the porpoise!

839
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:32,647
I don't think
it's a porpoise!

840
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:35,446
I'm telling you,
it's a porpoise.

841
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:37,604
Be friendly.

842
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:40,280
It will protect
you from the sharks.

843
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:41,965
Okay.

844
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,126
Come here.

845
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:48,965
Hey!

846
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:52,487
Hey.

847
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:57,001
Okay, that's a shark.

848
00:50:57,160 --> 00:50:58,650
That's what I said!

849
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:00,641
Jesus!

850
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:02,450
Stop befriending it!

851
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:03,567
Kill it!

852
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:05,444
It's not a porpoise!

853
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:07,330
It's not a porpoise!

854
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:09,289
Poke his eyes out!

855
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:10,441
Fight it!

856
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:20,440
Oh, my God.

857
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:21,681
That really happened?

858
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:24,725
Real face.

859
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:27,681
Sorry for palming
your face.

860
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:29,526
Oh, my God.

861
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:40,771
A pilot boat came.

862
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:43,366
They took him
four hours ago.

863
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:44,806
Before the storm.

864
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:46,201
Took him where?

865
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:48,001
Iceland.

866
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:51,205
Is there any way
that we could radio him?

867
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:54,523
It's very important that I
discuss something with him.

868
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:57,524
You jumped into the ocean
with our radio components.

869
00:51:57,680 --> 00:51:59,045
They are lost.

870
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:00,326
Correct?

871
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:02,364
Yeah, that's correct.

872
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:12,325
You're American?

873
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:14,201
Yeah.

874
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:16,370
Excellent!

875
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:17,726
Fonzie!

876
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:23,200
Come on, I'll find you some
dry clothing, homeslice.

877
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:31,370
Will this work?
For your items?

878
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:33,010
Oh, yeah.
Thank you.

879
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:34,764
Hey, I'll take
this, buddy.

880
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:35,847
Okay.

881
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:37,160
Hungry?
Sure.

882
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:40,130
I got some kick-ass cake, man.

883
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:44,081
Thank you.

884
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:45,446
Looking good.

885
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:47,608
You can keep it.

886
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,604
Hey, this is...

887
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:53,129
This is clementine cake.

888
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:55,684
This is clementine cake.
My mom makes this.

889
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:57,490
Yeah, Sean brought it.

890
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:01,244
Yeah.

891
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:03,451
Good.

892
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:18,481
Is this Sean's?

893
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:20,927
Yeah, he wrapped
the cake in it.

894
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:22,611
This is a shoot itinerary.

895
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:25,928
It's a field itinerary
for a photo...

896
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:28,289
Did he say anything
about where he was going?

897
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:30,442
No, he didn't say much.

898
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:34,440
He was just taking pictures of
these guys, the Chilean deckhands.

899
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:36,811
He even gave
me some tips...

900
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:38,610
for my Instagrams.

901
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:42,041
Facebook friends?

902
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:43,645
Yeah, sure.
Great.

903
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:47,600
What is "Eyjafallajokull"?

904
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:49,046
Eyjafjallajokull.

905
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:50,241
Excuse me?

906
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:51,321
Eyjafjallajokull.

907
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:53,281
What is that?

908
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:56,687
It's in Iceland.
It's a volcano.

909
00:53:56,920 --> 00:53:58,649
A volcano?
Yeah.

910
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:01,564
May 2nd. That's tomorrow.

911
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:02,841
Do you think
there's any way...

912
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:05,611
that we could possibly
land in Iceland?

913
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:06,921
Yeah.

914
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:08,161
Yeah?

915
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:10,368
We have to in the morning.

916
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:11,567
Great.

917
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:13,324
Because you
lost the radio.

918
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:15,569
Right, yeah, sorry.

919
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:17,643
Sorry. But that's...

920
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:20,201
Well, I just have
to get to...

921
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:21,447
Eyjafjallajokull.

922
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:22,561
Right.

923
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:31,240
Hey, I'll see you on
Sesame Street, man.

924
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:57,567
Okay, you're here, and
this is Eyjafjallajokull.

925
00:54:57,720 --> 00:54:59,165
It's 15 kilometers.

926
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:00,746
Okay. You can take
the shore bike.

927
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:02,846
But you better
get going, man.

928
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:05,309
Yeah, he didn't write a time
on that clue paper.

929
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:08,563
No, man. Hurry.
Because of...

930
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:13,007
What? I don't understand.

931
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:14,730
What he means, man,
is you have to hurry...

932
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:16,664
because there's a bunch
of horny Chileans...

933
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:19,087
who want to go
to the strip club.

934
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:20,486
There's only one bike.

935
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:29,403
Hurry, Walter,
hurry! Run! Go!

936
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:30,806
Go!

937
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:35,084
Stay gold, Pony Boy!

938
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:41,321
Hello?

939
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:43,129
Hey, what's up?

940
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:45,602
Todd? From eHarmony?

941
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:48,240
Yeah! What's up, man?

942
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:50,767
Not much.
How have you been?

943
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:53,446
Good. It's early here.
I just got up, man.

944
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:54,965
I was thinking about you.

945
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:56,281
Where are you?

946
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:57,606
Los Angeles.

947
00:56:57,760 --> 00:57:01,685
Hey, so your profile still
hasn't received any winks.

948
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:03,724
Even though I put
that you've been to Phoenix.

949
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:05,321
Oh!

950
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:08,924
I jumped out of a helicopter
yesterday into the ocean.

951
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:10,969
And had a shark fight.

952
00:57:11,120 --> 00:57:13,691
Yeah, listen,
I was mentioning before...

953
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:16,127
people who daydream too much,
they're not...

954
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:18,806
No, it was real.
I really did.

955
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:21,042
Really? Then I'll put down
"adrenaline junkie."

956
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:22,201
What kind of a shark?

957
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:23,361
Hey, Todd.

958
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:25,141
I can't really
talk right now.

959
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:26,326
I'm on my way
to a volcano.

960
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:27,481
What the...?

961
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:33,201
Hey.

962
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:35,602
Hi. Hey.

963
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:37,762
Do you guys
speak English?

964
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:41,882
I'm looking
for Eldgos Street.

965
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:42,961
Eldgos?

966
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:45,607
Is that a street?

967
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:47,729
Is this Eyjafjallakuta?

968
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:50,081
Something like that?

969
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:58,426
I don't think this guy
knows what eldgos is.

970
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:01,441
It's a longboard.

971
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:03,081
Yeah.

972
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:05,129
What is that?
Is that Thor, or...

973
00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:06,881
Odin?

974
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:09,805
A Norse god?
He's cool.

975
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:13,329
Hey.

976
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:17,726
Would you maybe
want to make a trade?

977
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:19,484
I know a kid who
would love that board.

978
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:23,960
It's cool. Look,
he stretches.

979
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:27,124
Here, come here
and check it out.

980
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:30,485
Yeah. He's fun.

981
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:33,728
Yeah, it's lots of
stretching fun.

982
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:39,003
Oh, man. We can tie
that around your sister...

983
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:40,401
Want to do it?

984
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:50,327
Yeah?

985
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:52,329
Great. Great.
Thank you.

986
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:12,201
Hello?

987
01:00:20,040 --> 01:00:21,087
Hello?

988
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:29,091
Hi.

989
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:30,801
Hi.

990
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:32,729
Do you speak English?

991
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:34,405
The hotel is closed.

992
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:37,568
Okay, yeah.

993
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:39,587
I'm trying
to find this guy.

994
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:41,601
This man, Sean O'Connell.

995
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:43,888
I think that he possibly
might have stayed here.

996
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:46,929
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I got a plane for him.

997
01:00:47,120 --> 01:00:48,770
At 1:00.

998
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:50,001
Fifteen minutes.

999
01:00:50,080 --> 01:00:52,401
He's at airfield
in Stykkisholmur.

1000
01:00:52,560 --> 01:00:54,369
In the valley.
Next town south.

1001
01:00:54,520 --> 01:00:56,329
Where is it?
Stykkisholmur.

1002
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:57,447
"Tickishoumer"?
Yeah.

1003
01:00:57,520 --> 01:00:58,601
No, no!

1004
01:00:58,720 --> 01:00:59,926
Is it straight
down that way?

1005
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:03,045
Thank you!

1006
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:07,404
It's all right,
I know him!

1007
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:31,290
Step in front
of a runaway train

1008
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:37,004
Just to feel alive again

1009
01:02:40,040 --> 01:02:43,010
Pushing forward
through the night

1010
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:48,684
Aching chest and blurry sight

1011
01:02:50,040 --> 01:02:54,204
It's so far, so far away

1012
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:59,891
It's so far, so far away

1013
01:03:48,080 --> 01:03:49,081
Hello. Hello.

1014
01:03:49,320 --> 01:03:50,845
Come on, come on. Eldgos!

1015
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,490
What's going on?
Where is everybody?

1016
01:03:52,680 --> 01:03:54,523
Eldgos.
Eldgos!

1017
01:03:54,760 --> 01:03:56,250
Eldgos. Eldgos.

1018
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:57,547
What does that mean?
Eretion.

1019
01:03:57,560 --> 01:03:58,641
Erertion?

1020
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:00,370
Erection!

1021
01:04:00,560 --> 01:04:02,005
"Erection"?
Yes. No!

1022
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:04,440
Eruption!

1023
01:04:04,600 --> 01:04:05,840
Eruption!
Yes.

1024
01:04:19,240 --> 01:04:20,401
Sean.

1025
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:39,565
Faster! Go faster!

1026
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:44,042
Holy shit! Faster!

1027
01:04:47,160 --> 01:04:48,161
Oh, my God!

1028
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:12,083
Thanks for coming
back for me.

1029
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:13,971
I really appreciate it.

1030
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:15,400
I hope you find your man.

1031
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:16,481
Thanks.

1032
01:05:16,600 --> 01:05:17,601
Yeah.

1033
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:19,489
There's a motel
near the pizza place there.

1034
01:05:25,680 --> 01:05:27,170
Good luck.

1035
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:15,446
Photographic Accounts.

1036
01:06:15,600 --> 01:06:17,728
Cheryl.
This is Cheryl Melhoff.

1037
01:06:17,880 --> 01:06:19,564
Hey, it's Walter Mitty.

1038
01:06:19,720 --> 01:06:21,722
Hey. I'd walked down
to say hi to you

1039
01:06:21,880 --> 01:06:23,882
about an hour ago,
and you weren't there.

1040
01:06:24,080 --> 01:06:25,730
That's because,
guess what.

1041
01:06:26,360 --> 01:06:27,930
I'm in Iceland.

1042
01:06:28,080 --> 01:06:29,081
Iceland?

1043
01:06:29,240 --> 01:06:30,924
Wait, wasn't it Greenland?

1044
01:06:31,080 --> 01:06:32,684
Yeah. Yeah, it was.

1045
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:34,769
You know that they're
not the same place.

1046
01:06:34,920 --> 01:06:37,400
No, no, no. I went to
Greenland and then...

1047
01:06:37,560 --> 01:06:42,407
I got on a fishing vessel tracking
Sean and ended up here in Iceland.

1048
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:43,931
You're in Iceland.

1049
01:06:44,080 --> 01:06:46,401
Yeah. At a Papa John's.

1050
01:06:47,040 --> 01:06:48,451
Hey, I got more clues.

1051
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:49,726
What did you find?

1052
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:52,451
There's a date
that Sean wrote.

1053
01:06:52,600 --> 01:06:54,807
And some words
on a cake wrapper.

1054
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:57,611
"Rajqawee," "Buzkashi"...

1055
01:06:57,760 --> 01:06:58,921
and "Warlocks."

1056
01:06:59,080 --> 01:07:00,923
Wait. They have a
Papa John's in Iceland?

1057
01:07:01,120 --> 01:07:03,600
Yeah. I just had to...
I just left.

1058
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:05,765
Did you get kicked out?

1059
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:07,285
No, I just needed to leave.

1060
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:09,124
Just the atmosphere.

1061
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:12,409
And the cups.

1062
01:07:13,160 --> 01:07:15,606
Hey, I was right
on Sean's trail.

1063
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:17,291
Then I lost him.

1064
01:07:17,560 --> 01:07:19,244
"Strong little man."

1065
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:21,447
Thanks.

1066
01:07:22,120 --> 01:07:25,283
No. "Rajqawee" means
"strong little man"...

1067
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:27,761
in, like,
40 Arabic countries.

1068
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:30,844
And "Buzkashi" is
"goat hockey"...

1069
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:32,809
in Central Asia.

1070
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:35,964
And "Warlocks"...

1071
01:07:36,600 --> 01:07:37,647
Yeah.

1072
01:07:38,440 --> 01:07:40,488
I was hoping
they would connect.

1073
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:46,922
So, you said that you left Papa
John's because of the cups?

1074
01:07:47,120 --> 01:07:49,646
Is there something I should
be aware of as a customer?

1075
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:53,323
No, I just worked there,
that's all.

1076
01:07:54,680 --> 01:07:57,001
I used to have a mohawk...

1077
01:07:57,480 --> 01:07:59,209
and a backpack...

1078
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:04,483
and this idea of who I wanted
to be and what I wanted to do.

1079
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:08,040
Yeah?

1080
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:10,168
Nothing. Just...

1081
01:08:12,040 --> 01:08:14,691
I was pretty
close with my dad.

1082
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:19,687
And he died when I
was 17, on a Tuesday.

1083
01:08:19,840 --> 01:08:21,808
And we didn't
have any savings.

1084
01:08:22,360 --> 01:08:25,728
So I got a haircut
that Thursday...

1085
01:08:25,880 --> 01:08:29,327
and a job the same Thursday.

1086
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:32,051
Papa John's?

1087
01:08:32,840 --> 01:08:34,046
Yeah.

1088
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:38,802
Your dad let
you have a mohawk?

1089
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:41,807
He shaved my head.

1090
01:08:42,440 --> 01:08:44,522
That's a good dad move.

1091
01:08:45,360 --> 01:08:46,771
Yeah.

1092
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:49,931
Is it nice there?

1093
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:53,041
Yeah, it is.

1094
01:08:53,720 --> 01:08:55,484
It's really beautiful.

1095
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:57,251
Well, it's pretty
sucky here.

1096
01:08:57,440 --> 01:08:58,646
Human Resources
has already started

1097
01:08:58,760 --> 01:08:59,966
letting some of
the staff go...

1098
01:09:00,120 --> 01:09:02,441
so it'll be a lot different
when you get back.

1099
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:05,562
Hey, I picked
something up for...

1100
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:09,285
I think I lost you.

1101
01:09:11,240 --> 01:09:13,447
You know what? I'll catch
you up when I see you.

1102
01:09:14,240 --> 01:09:15,321
Great. Okay.

1103
01:09:15,480 --> 01:09:17,562
All right. Okay.

1104
01:09:18,120 --> 01:09:19,246
Bye, Walter.

1105
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:20,845
Bye, Cheryl.

1106
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:03,641
What's going on?

1107
01:10:05,440 --> 01:10:07,204
They shut down
two floors.

1108
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:10,125
Why do you
look rugged?

1109
01:10:12,840 --> 01:10:14,046
I see you.

1110
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:16,684
I see you!

1111
01:10:16,840 --> 01:10:17,966
What did I say?

1112
01:10:18,120 --> 01:10:19,565
I see you.

1113
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:21,564
The photograph.
Now. Let me see it.

1114
01:10:21,720 --> 01:10:24,166
He looked it up. There's no
such thing as a silver bath.

1115
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:27,644
Listen, there was uncertainty
about the negative.

1116
01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:29,764
I understood that, hopefully,
it was in Iceland.

1117
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:30,961
It was in your care.

1118
01:10:31,080 --> 01:10:32,081
If you just give
me some more time...

1119
01:10:32,240 --> 01:10:33,241
You're fired.

1120
01:10:33,320 --> 01:10:34,651
We'll make another cover.

1121
01:10:34,720 --> 01:10:35,721
Hey!

1122
01:10:39,160 --> 01:10:41,891
More than a million, way more,
negatives have come through my office.

1123
01:10:42,040 --> 01:10:43,530
I have never mislaid one.

1124
01:10:44,160 --> 01:10:47,448
Put it on a plaque.
Hang it at your next job.

1125
01:10:48,480 --> 01:10:50,482
Now I got to explain
this to the board?

1126
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:54,331
Hey.

1127
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:57,121
Are you okay?

1128
01:10:57,200 --> 01:10:58,690
Yeah.

1129
01:10:59,320 --> 01:11:00,845
That's cool.

1130
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:04,368
It's a skateboard.
It's for Cheryl's son.

1131
01:11:05,960 --> 01:11:07,962
Cheryl's not in.
She was let go.

1132
01:11:08,680 --> 01:11:10,569
I told you, man,
it's bad.

1133
01:11:10,720 --> 01:11:12,165
Hey! That's my fern.

1134
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:14,850
Thank you.

1135
01:12:05,960 --> 01:12:06,961
Hi.

1136
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:08,761
Hi.

1137
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:12,645
Can I...?

1138
01:12:14,680 --> 01:12:16,045
Yeah.

1139
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:19,246
I'm looking for
Cheryl Melhoff.

1140
01:12:19,880 --> 01:12:20,881
You want Cheryl?

1141
01:12:21,560 --> 01:12:23,847
Yeah. She's...

1142
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:29,811
We work together, and she was
helping me with a work thing.

1143
01:12:32,160 --> 01:12:33,650
Cheryl.

1144
01:12:35,640 --> 01:12:37,085
Honey?

1145
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:40,370
There's some guy here.

1146
01:12:40,520 --> 01:12:42,170
What?

1147
01:12:44,160 --> 01:12:45,286
From work.

1148
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:48,321
Okay, hold on.
I'm on the phone.

1149
01:13:13,200 --> 01:13:14,486
It's Conan.

1150
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:19,487
Tonight, First Lady Michelle
Obama, Walter Mitty.

1151
01:13:19,640 --> 01:13:21,483
Can we talk
about your love life?

1152
01:13:21,800 --> 01:13:23,211
I think people
would be interested.

1153
01:13:23,360 --> 01:13:25,091
You don't want to know
about my love life.

1154
01:13:25,320 --> 01:13:26,481
I think they do.

1155
01:13:26,720 --> 01:13:30,361
Yeah, I think they do. Now, I
don't believe everything I read.

1156
01:13:30,520 --> 01:13:33,251
There's a scandal?
A little scandal?

1157
01:13:33,400 --> 01:13:35,402
A little scandal, yes.

1158
01:13:35,560 --> 01:13:39,167
She was back with her
husband, or something.

1159
01:13:39,320 --> 01:13:40,287
Then she fell for you?

1160
01:13:40,360 --> 01:13:42,522
Where there's smoke,
there's fire.

1161
01:13:42,680 --> 01:13:43,841
You're awesome, Walter.

1162
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:45,001
Thanks.

1163
01:13:45,080 --> 01:13:46,161
Sure.

1164
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:48,050
Can you turn this off?

1165
01:13:49,080 --> 01:13:50,127
It stays on.

1166
01:13:53,440 --> 01:13:55,681
I'm just going to get out.

1167
01:14:10,120 --> 01:14:11,167
Hey, Mom.

1168
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:12,281
Hi, honey.

1169
01:14:13,280 --> 01:14:15,203
Walter, you got
to tip these guys.

1170
01:14:15,360 --> 01:14:17,362
We got the piano
back safe, Mom.

1171
01:14:18,360 --> 01:14:20,408
Are you back
from your work trip?

1172
01:14:20,600 --> 01:14:22,125
Yeah, this morning.

1173
01:14:22,360 --> 01:14:23,566
Hungry?

1174
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:25,001
Mmm-hmm.

1175
01:14:25,560 --> 01:14:27,050
I'm making soup.
Thanks.

1176
01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:28,804
Hey, tipping time now.

1177
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:36,290
This is all I got.

1178
01:14:38,840 --> 01:14:40,330
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

1179
01:14:40,480 --> 01:14:42,323
All right,
thanks, everybody.

1180
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:43,811
For all your hard work.

1181
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:45,161
We appreciate it, ma'am.

1182
01:14:45,320 --> 01:14:47,049
You did great. You
just let yourself out.

1183
01:14:47,200 --> 01:14:48,645
He's good for this.

1184
01:14:51,160 --> 01:14:52,685
Are you gonna
stay for dinner?

1185
01:14:52,880 --> 01:14:54,006
Oh, Mom,
I'd love to.

1186
01:14:54,160 --> 01:14:55,650
I think I'm just
really wiped out

1187
01:14:55,800 --> 01:14:57,245
after supervising moving
that thing all day.

1188
01:14:57,400 --> 01:15:00,290
I think I just need to go to
yoga and then just crash.

1189
01:15:00,440 --> 01:15:01,965
What is it?
A class?

1190
01:15:02,360 --> 01:15:03,361
Yes, yoga.

1191
01:15:03,560 --> 01:15:06,291
It's a class. I go to the hot
kind, where they heat the room.

1192
01:15:07,080 --> 01:15:08,570
Have you heard of that? Sure.

1193
01:15:08,720 --> 01:15:10,688
You have?
It's great for you.

1194
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:12,430
You just get it all
out of your system.

1195
01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:14,960
You get your sweat out, you just
get everything, all your fear.

1196
01:15:15,120 --> 01:15:17,248
I'm waiting on a call
about an audition.

1197
01:15:17,400 --> 01:15:18,640
That Grease show?

1198
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:20,086
Yeah.
Rizzo?

1199
01:15:20,280 --> 01:15:22,328
Yeah. I'm really
excited about it.

1200
01:15:23,320 --> 01:15:25,284
What's good about this is that
I just don't worry about it.

1201
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:26,760
I just get
out of my head.

1202
01:15:26,920 --> 01:15:27,967
Is that good for you?

1203
01:15:28,040 --> 01:15:30,247
I feel like it's good
in a class like this.

1204
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:32,104
I mean, I'm not going to get
paid for it, which is fine.

1205
01:15:32,160 --> 01:15:33,685
It's not about money.
Wonderful.

1206
01:15:33,880 --> 01:15:35,450
And I feel like...

1207
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:39,571
It's just for kids, but I think it's
important for them to start early.

1208
01:15:40,080 --> 01:15:41,320
I'm really
thrilled, Mom.

1209
01:15:41,480 --> 01:15:43,448
I think I'm just
going to enjoy it.

1210
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:45,443
Just standing in front
of people and talking.

1211
01:15:45,960 --> 01:15:47,883
You'll be good at that.
Yeah.

1212
01:15:48,040 --> 01:15:49,929
You'll really be good at that.
I think so, too, Mom.

1213
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:51,411
Hey. Mom?

1214
01:15:51,560 --> 01:15:52,721
Yeah.

1215
01:15:53,360 --> 01:15:57,763
Did somebody take a picture of
your piano, like, a week ago?

1216
01:16:00,080 --> 01:16:01,366
I did.

1217
01:16:02,160 --> 01:16:03,969
With Sean's camera.

1218
01:16:08,120 --> 01:16:09,326
Sean O'Connell's camera?

1219
01:16:09,480 --> 01:16:11,323
Yeah, he came to visit.

1220
01:16:12,440 --> 01:16:13,805
Mom, what?

1221
01:16:14,920 --> 01:16:15,921
Yeah.

1222
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:17,889
He wanted to know
about your work schedule,

1223
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:19,968
when you left,
when you came home.

1224
01:16:20,120 --> 01:16:22,487
He said you
really understood LIFE.

1225
01:16:22,680 --> 01:16:24,409
He was really
interested in your work.

1226
01:16:26,680 --> 01:16:28,125
Mom, why didn't you tell me?

1227
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:30,846
I told you. I told you
in the produce aisle.

1228
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:32,570
I remember that.

1229
01:16:34,160 --> 01:16:35,207
Maybe you were...

1230
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:39,086
Odessa, what is it you call it when he
goes into one of his little places?

1231
01:16:39,280 --> 01:16:40,884
"Zoned out."

1232
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:42,963
You do that
now and then.

1233
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:46,529
What's the matter?

1234
01:16:47,960 --> 01:16:49,769
I got fired.

1235
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:52,049
I lost a picture of his.

1236
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:53,801
Can you find it?

1237
01:16:55,040 --> 01:16:57,168
No, I don't know
where he is.

1238
01:16:57,320 --> 01:17:00,403
He's someplace
with warlocks or...

1239
01:17:01,320 --> 01:17:02,970
Warlords.

1240
01:17:03,200 --> 01:17:04,690
No, warlocks.

1241
01:17:05,080 --> 01:17:06,684
No. Warlords.

1242
01:17:06,840 --> 01:17:10,162
Sean said he had to meet
with warlords very soon...

1243
01:17:10,320 --> 01:17:12,322
and maybe he
would take my cake

1244
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:14,482
so that he could
get permission...

1245
01:17:14,640 --> 01:17:17,041
to trek through
the wilds and places.

1246
01:17:17,200 --> 01:17:20,044
He said he wants to photograph
snow leopards. How about that?

1247
01:17:20,200 --> 01:17:21,645
Who?

1248
01:17:31,040 --> 01:17:33,646
"Ungoverned Afghanistan."

1249
01:17:36,600 --> 01:17:37,647
Mmm-hmm.

1250
01:17:37,720 --> 01:17:38,721
That's where Sean is.

1251
01:17:39,440 --> 01:17:41,966
Crazy Afghanistan. Yeah.

1252
01:17:42,600 --> 01:17:44,728
In the upper Himalayas.

1253
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:47,364
They can't
let you go.

1254
01:17:48,360 --> 01:17:50,442
You were Sean's partner.

1255
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:51,801
He told me...

1256
01:17:51,960 --> 01:17:54,440
that you were the person
who worked the hardest...

1257
01:17:54,600 --> 01:17:59,049
to make sure his work was
realized the way he wished.

1258
01:18:04,280 --> 01:18:05,964
You finish his work.

1259
01:18:49,840 --> 01:18:52,081
Heaven is a switchboard
that you want to fight

1260
01:18:52,160 --> 01:18:54,401
She would even miss you
if you taught her sight

1261
01:18:54,480 --> 01:18:56,608
Power politician leaning
to the right

1262
01:18:56,680 --> 01:18:57,920
Baby's got a trust fund

1263
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,924
That she'll want to
go off like that

1264
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,002
Get off of my stack

1265
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:05,284
Leave a little window

1266
01:19:05,360 --> 01:19:07,442
Get off of my stack

1267
01:19:15,680 --> 01:19:17,808
Now we wear same-colored
yellow uniforms

1268
01:19:17,880 --> 01:19:20,486
Sky is burning but at
least we know we're warm

1269
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:22,608
Go and run yourself
a million miles

1270
01:19:22,680 --> 01:19:24,045
Hoping that the colors run out

1271
01:19:24,160 --> 01:19:26,401
And you go off like that

1272
01:19:26,760 --> 01:19:28,842
Get off of my stack

1273
01:19:32,040 --> 01:19:34,725
Stack

1274
01:21:47,160 --> 01:21:48,207
Hey, Todd.

1275
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:50,004
Hey, what's up?

1276
01:21:50,160 --> 01:21:51,491
Not much.

1277
01:21:51,640 --> 01:21:55,281
Hey, good news. Your profile
really rounded out, man.

1278
01:21:55,440 --> 01:21:57,204
That volcano-shark combo.

1279
01:21:57,360 --> 01:22:00,330
That is money in the bank.
Get ready to get a lot of winks.

1280
01:22:00,480 --> 01:22:01,686
Okay.

1281
01:22:01,840 --> 01:22:03,171
But something else.

1282
01:22:03,320 --> 01:22:05,163
Cheryl Melhoff...

1283
01:22:05,320 --> 01:22:07,891
she's not on here anymore.
Withdrawn.

1284
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:09,401
Oh.

1285
01:22:09,560 --> 01:22:11,324
Really?
Yeah.

1286
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:13,330
Hey, man,
where are you now?

1287
01:22:13,480 --> 01:22:14,686
Himalayas.

1288
01:22:14,840 --> 01:22:18,003
The Himalayas.
I love it.

1289
01:22:18,200 --> 01:22:19,690
That is a kick-ass
"Been There."

1290
01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:21,842
Todd, I'm gonna
keep this short.

1291
01:22:22,040 --> 01:22:23,690
I have to make
oxygen choices.

1292
01:22:23,840 --> 01:22:26,081
Hey, I get it. so!

1293
01:22:26,240 --> 01:22:29,403
Anyway, you have a profile now.
Congratulations.

1294
01:22:29,560 --> 01:22:31,369
Cool, but,
you know what?

1295
01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:33,090
Would you take me off?

1296
01:22:33,240 --> 01:22:36,244
I can't really
swing that $500 yearly.

1297
01:22:36,400 --> 01:22:37,686
Hey.

1298
01:22:40,200 --> 01:22:41,281
Hey, man.

1299
01:22:41,360 --> 01:22:42,646
You're sure?
Because I feel like

1300
01:22:42,760 --> 01:22:44,100
we're really
onto something here.

1301
01:22:44,160 --> 01:22:47,050
Do you mind?
I'm working.

1302
01:22:47,200 --> 01:22:49,202
This is one of the best
profiles I've ever done.

1303
01:22:49,400 --> 01:22:51,331
And our refund policy,
well, we don't have one...

1304
01:22:51,360 --> 01:22:53,169
Todd, I got to go.

1305
01:22:55,080 --> 01:22:56,081
Sean.

1306
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:58,081
Yeah.

1307
01:23:04,840 --> 01:23:06,888
It's Walter.

1308
01:23:10,520 --> 01:23:12,249
Mitty.

1309
01:23:21,240 --> 01:23:22,241
Walter Mitty.

1310
01:23:23,120 --> 01:23:24,770
Seriously?

1311
01:23:26,880 --> 01:23:29,087
How the hell did
you get up here?

1312
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:31,445
I just...

1313
01:23:35,080 --> 01:23:36,809
I've been looking for you.

1314
01:23:39,800 --> 01:23:41,404
Sit down.

1315
01:23:48,240 --> 01:23:49,605
I'll sit.

1316
01:23:57,600 --> 01:23:59,443
Well, take your time.
Settle in.

1317
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:01,443
Try to be
real still, okay?

1318
01:24:03,920 --> 01:24:05,490
There's a snow leopard.

1319
01:24:06,640 --> 01:24:09,166
Right in this ridge.

1320
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:13,686
So we have to try to be very,
very, very, very still.

1321
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:19,326
They call the snow
leopard the "ghost cat."

1322
01:24:21,320 --> 01:24:23,607
it never lets
itself be seen.

1323
01:24:28,360 --> 01:24:30,362
Ghost cat?

1324
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:37,161
Beautiful things
don't ask for attention.

1325
01:24:42,720 --> 01:24:47,965
Sean, there was a negative that
got separated from your roll.

1326
01:24:50,040 --> 01:24:53,010
I'm taking a lot of
heat over it at work.

1327
01:24:53,160 --> 01:24:57,006
It never came with the
roll that you sent.

1328
01:24:57,160 --> 01:24:59,003
The last roll
you're talking about?

1329
01:24:59,160 --> 01:25:00,321
Yeah.

1330
01:25:00,440 --> 01:25:01,521
The 25.

1331
01:25:02,960 --> 01:25:04,644
Yeah.

1332
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:07,808
You're sitting on it.

1333
01:25:10,840 --> 01:25:12,729
Why am I sitting on it?

1334
01:25:14,160 --> 01:25:16,049
It's in your wallet.

1335
01:25:16,880 --> 01:25:18,928
That was the gift.

1336
01:25:19,080 --> 01:25:20,844
The photograph.

1337
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:22,889
The wallet was just something
I could put it in.

1338
01:25:23,040 --> 01:25:26,487
So, I put it in a little slot,
the little picture holder in there.

1339
01:25:26,680 --> 01:25:28,330
I thought it
would be cute.

1340
01:25:30,920 --> 01:25:32,763
I told you,
"look inside."

1341
01:25:33,440 --> 01:25:35,044
In the note.

1342
01:25:35,320 --> 01:25:36,526
You said "look inside."

1343
01:25:36,680 --> 01:25:39,889
I thought you meant look
inside of the wrapping paper.

1344
01:25:40,440 --> 01:25:43,046
Yeah? Well, you got a real
nice surprise coming.

1345
01:25:43,240 --> 01:25:45,402
No, I don't have it.

1346
01:25:45,560 --> 01:25:47,483
I don't have
it anymore.

1347
01:25:47,560 --> 01:25:48,561
Whoa!

1348
01:25:54,440 --> 01:25:56,408
What the hell
were you thinking?

1349
01:25:58,680 --> 01:26:01,604
I mean, I'm sorry, I've admired
you for a very long time...

1350
01:26:01,800 --> 01:26:05,441
but that is not a good move,
at all, with a valuable negative.

1351
01:26:05,600 --> 01:26:07,568
Sorry, I just...

1352
01:26:07,760 --> 01:26:10,286
I thought it would be
a playful kind of thing.

1353
01:26:10,440 --> 01:26:11,930
Playful?

1354
01:26:13,120 --> 01:26:14,724
Too playful.

1355
01:26:16,080 --> 01:26:17,445
I see what you're saying.

1356
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:20,251
With the cover, I should have
been more straightforward.

1357
01:26:20,440 --> 01:26:23,489
But can I ask you, I mean,
if you don't mind...

1358
01:26:24,440 --> 01:26:26,249
what did you do
with the wallet?

1359
01:26:27,280 --> 01:26:28,725
Chucked it.

1360
01:26:31,080 --> 01:26:33,208
Well, that hurts
my feelings.

1361
01:26:34,440 --> 01:26:36,442
No. Man, I liked
it very much.

1362
01:26:36,600 --> 01:26:37,965
I appreciated
it very much.

1363
01:26:38,120 --> 01:26:39,121
So you threw it away?

1364
01:26:43,440 --> 01:26:46,364
So, you have no
idea what it was?

1365
01:26:47,440 --> 01:26:48,441
The photograph?

1366
01:26:52,280 --> 01:26:53,645
It's a shame.

1367
01:26:56,120 --> 01:26:57,963
It was a beauty.

1368
01:27:14,560 --> 01:27:16,961
How did you
find me, anyway?

1369
01:27:19,480 --> 01:27:20,720
My mom.

1370
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:24,843
Cool lady. Knows
how to bake.

1371
01:27:25,240 --> 01:27:26,765
Yeah.

1372
01:27:29,400 --> 01:27:30,686
Hey, why did you...
Shh!

1373
01:28:06,920 --> 01:28:09,446
When are you gonna take it?

1374
01:28:13,520 --> 01:28:15,443
Sometimes I don't.

1375
01:28:16,320 --> 01:28:18,129
If I like a moment...

1376
01:28:18,760 --> 01:28:22,446
I mean, me, personally...

1377
01:28:24,400 --> 01:28:27,563
I don't like to have the
distraction of the camera.

1378
01:28:31,040 --> 01:28:34,886
Just want to stay in it.

1379
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:40,084
Stay in it?

1380
01:28:41,560 --> 01:28:43,244
Yeah, right there.

1381
01:28:44,400 --> 01:28:46,243
Right here.

1382
01:28:49,560 --> 01:28:51,403
Now it's gone.
It's gone.

1383
01:28:58,000 --> 01:28:59,445
That looks like fun.

1384
01:28:59,800 --> 01:29:01,768
I think I'm
gonna jump in.

1385
01:29:02,880 --> 01:29:05,247
Hey, what was
the picture, Sean?

1386
01:29:06,120 --> 01:29:09,283
We're gonna be odd-numbered
if you don't join.

1387
01:29:10,600 --> 01:29:12,887
What was the picture?

1388
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:17,641
Let's just call it a ghost cat,
Walter Mitty.

1389
01:29:25,200 --> 01:29:27,487
What's in your hand

1390
01:29:28,600 --> 01:29:31,843
You're pinned down to routines

1391
01:29:35,440 --> 01:29:38,046
Elevate and leave

1392
01:29:38,800 --> 01:29:41,201
The flickering screen

1393
01:29:45,440 --> 01:29:48,649
Where nothing is compromised

1394
01:29:49,520 --> 01:29:51,761
Nothing is lost

1395
01:29:55,760 --> 01:29:58,843
When everything is realized

1396
01:30:00,120 --> 01:30:02,202
Nothing is crossed

1397
01:31:04,800 --> 01:31:06,564
You made the watch list.

1398
01:31:06,720 --> 01:31:09,451
How did you get to Afghanistan?
There's a travel ban.

1399
01:31:10,640 --> 01:31:12,165
Through Yemen.

1400
01:31:13,440 --> 01:31:15,363
Violent place.

1401
01:31:16,320 --> 01:31:18,607
That's why the air
fare is only $84.

1402
01:31:19,680 --> 01:31:21,603
Can I have my life back?

1403
01:31:23,640 --> 01:31:25,483
Do you know anyone
in Los Angeles?

1404
01:31:25,640 --> 01:31:27,802
No.
Any acquaintances? Okay.

1405
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:29,001
Any companions?

1406
01:31:29,160 --> 01:31:32,403
Anybody here who might be able to
verify that you're Walter Mitty?

1407
01:31:42,600 --> 01:31:44,170
Walter Mitty?

1408
01:31:44,360 --> 01:31:45,361
Yeah.

1409
01:31:46,520 --> 01:31:48,648
Todd Mahar.
eHarmony.

1410
01:31:49,640 --> 01:31:50,641
Hey.

1411
01:31:52,240 --> 01:31:53,241
Thank you.
Thanks.

1412
01:31:53,440 --> 01:31:54,965
What? Come here.

1413
01:31:55,120 --> 01:31:56,690
Come here.

1414
01:31:56,840 --> 01:31:58,285
Backpack.

1415
01:31:58,440 --> 01:31:59,771
Big hug!

1416
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,128
Airport prison, huh?

1417
01:32:02,200 --> 01:32:03,201
Yeah.

1418
01:32:03,320 --> 01:32:05,846
Tell me all about it over a Cinnabon.
Come on.

1419
01:32:06,040 --> 01:32:07,610
Cinnabon!

1420
01:32:09,640 --> 01:32:11,722
How long were you
detained for, by the way?

1421
01:32:13,120 --> 01:32:14,770
Like, 17 hours.

1422
01:32:15,160 --> 01:32:17,447
Wow! How's that
Cinnabon taste?

1423
01:32:17,600 --> 01:32:18,601
Really great.

1424
01:32:18,840 --> 01:32:21,650
That's frosted heroin. That's
what you're eating, my friend.

1425
01:32:21,800 --> 01:32:24,485
That's what you're having
right there, man.

1426
01:32:24,600 --> 01:32:25,567
By the way...

1427
01:32:25,640 --> 01:32:29,406
you got 300 winks before I
took down your profile.

1428
01:32:29,600 --> 01:32:32,171
In the space of two hours.
It was crazy.

1429
01:32:32,320 --> 01:32:33,945
I thought I was selling
concert tickets.

1430
01:32:34,760 --> 01:32:36,000
I never checked.

1431
01:32:36,120 --> 01:32:37,963
Oh! Because of...

1432
01:32:38,840 --> 01:32:41,571
the "Pina Colada"
girl that quit?

1433
01:32:42,400 --> 01:32:43,925
Yeah.
Yeah.

1434
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:45,001
Cheryl.

1435
01:32:46,440 --> 01:32:50,650
Cheryl, who did not respond
to a single wink...

1436
01:32:50,800 --> 01:32:52,165
the whole time
she was on there.

1437
01:32:52,560 --> 01:32:54,085
That's a choosy lady.

1438
01:32:58,920 --> 01:33:00,001
How's the...

1439
01:33:01,600 --> 01:33:03,568
daydreaming going?

1440
01:33:06,480 --> 01:33:07,845
Lately, less.

1441
01:33:09,680 --> 01:33:10,841
Good.

1442
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:12,161
Less is good.

1443
01:33:12,960 --> 01:33:14,246
Thanks for the pastry.

1444
01:33:14,440 --> 01:33:16,522
Yeah, well, you owe me.

1445
01:33:16,680 --> 01:33:19,047
I'll send you a check
as soon as I sell the piano.

1446
01:33:20,680 --> 01:33:22,409
You have a lot
on your plate.

1447
01:33:23,120 --> 01:33:25,043
What are you
gonna do now?

1448
01:33:26,200 --> 01:33:27,964
Go out and
get another job.

1449
01:33:32,200 --> 01:33:33,201
Boom!

1450
01:33:35,520 --> 01:33:37,045
Sorry, Walter,
I just...

1451
01:33:37,200 --> 01:33:38,167
What?

1452
01:33:38,240 --> 01:33:40,049
You are so not
how I pictured you.

1453
01:33:41,160 --> 01:33:42,650
How did you picture me?

1454
01:33:42,840 --> 01:33:45,286
I pictured you as a little
gray piece of paper.

1455
01:33:45,960 --> 01:33:47,371
But now I see you...

1456
01:33:47,520 --> 01:33:49,648
and it's like
Indiana Jones...

1457
01:33:49,800 --> 01:33:51,086
decided to become
the lead singer

1458
01:33:51,200 --> 01:33:52,765
of The Strokes or
something like that.

1459
01:33:52,920 --> 01:33:54,729
It's nuts. I know.

1460
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:16,331
Sorry, Mom.

1461
01:34:16,480 --> 01:34:17,641
What for?

1462
01:34:18,720 --> 01:34:20,848
Dad bought it for you.
It was my responsibility.

1463
01:34:21,560 --> 01:34:22,766
Oh, Walter.

1464
01:34:23,280 --> 01:34:24,327
We're all grown here.

1465
01:34:24,400 --> 01:34:26,289
We're all good.

1466
01:34:48,320 --> 01:34:49,367
Ooh!

1467
01:34:49,440 --> 01:34:51,761
That's heavy duty,
that sum.

1468
01:34:51,920 --> 01:34:53,763
You should put
this in your wallet.

1469
01:34:53,920 --> 01:34:55,649
I don't have one.
Oh.

1470
01:35:05,200 --> 01:35:06,247
I found it
in the trash.

1471
01:35:06,400 --> 01:35:09,085
I always save
your knick-knacks.

1472
01:35:14,800 --> 01:35:16,131
Thanks.

1473
01:35:19,080 --> 01:35:20,206
Got it, Mom?
Got it.

1474
01:35:20,400 --> 01:35:21,765
Watch the stairs.

1475
01:36:06,360 --> 01:36:07,850
I think this works.

1476
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,731
Heart of America. Different generations.
This says it all.

1477
01:36:12,200 --> 01:36:13,326
Oh, hey. Welcome.

1478
01:36:13,480 --> 01:36:15,528
Wait, I'm sorry,
not welcome.

1479
01:36:15,680 --> 01:36:17,569
Not an employee.

1480
01:36:18,160 --> 01:36:19,571
Sorry.

1481
01:36:23,720 --> 01:36:26,530
There's the picture
Sean wanted. 25.

1482
01:36:30,040 --> 01:36:32,725
You have two days
to print for cover.

1483
01:36:35,200 --> 01:36:37,362
There's your quintessence.

1484
01:36:41,360 --> 01:36:42,441
Hey.

1485
01:36:44,400 --> 01:36:46,209
Do you know our motto?

1486
01:36:49,080 --> 01:36:50,684
"Life...

1487
01:36:52,200 --> 01:36:55,044
"I'm lovin' it?"

1488
01:36:55,600 --> 01:36:56,726
No.

1489
01:36:57,080 --> 01:36:59,082
That's McDonald's.

1490
01:37:01,760 --> 01:37:03,922
This thing that
you do, Ted...

1491
01:37:04,080 --> 01:37:06,526
where you come into a place
and you push people out.

1492
01:37:08,880 --> 01:37:10,723
You should know that those
people worked really hard

1493
01:37:10,840 --> 01:37:12,729
to build this magazine.

1494
01:37:14,960 --> 01:37:16,724
They believed
in the motto.

1495
01:37:17,720 --> 01:37:18,881
And I get it. You got
your marching orders...

1496
01:37:19,040 --> 01:37:21,805
and you have to do
what you have to do.

1497
01:37:23,280 --> 01:37:25,726
But you don't have
to be such a dick.

1498
01:37:29,280 --> 01:37:33,251
Put that on a plaque, and
hang it at your nex tjob.

1499
01:37:44,320 --> 01:37:47,449
What was it? Sasquatch?
A unicorn?

1500
01:37:47,600 --> 01:37:49,443
The negative?
Yeah.

1501
01:37:50,120 --> 01:37:51,610
I didn't look.

1502
01:37:56,920 --> 01:37:59,002
You were
a good boss, Walter.

1503
01:38:01,280 --> 01:38:02,850
Thanks, man.

1504
01:39:21,360 --> 01:39:22,930
Hey, Walter.
What's up?

1505
01:39:23,080 --> 01:39:24,570
Check this out.

1506
01:39:36,880 --> 01:39:38,086
See you!

1507
01:39:39,880 --> 01:39:40,961
Hi.

1508
01:39:52,240 --> 01:39:54,561
Walter Mitty.
Severance package.

1509
01:40:36,600 --> 01:40:37,806
Hey.

1510
01:40:38,640 --> 01:40:39,971
Cheryl.

1511
01:40:41,800 --> 01:40:43,165
Hey.
Hey.

1512
01:40:43,840 --> 01:40:46,286
I got that email
from Rich yesterday.

1513
01:40:46,440 --> 01:40:47,726
He's really good.

1514
01:40:47,880 --> 01:40:49,120
Walter, thank you.

1515
01:40:49,280 --> 01:40:50,566
That was...

1516
01:40:50,720 --> 01:40:53,883
That was just a really
cool thing to do.

1517
01:40:54,040 --> 01:40:56,042
I just saw it
in Iceland.

1518
01:40:56,640 --> 01:40:57,641
He loves it.

1519
01:40:57,800 --> 01:40:59,689
And I'm taking
him this afternoon.

1520
01:41:02,160 --> 01:41:04,003
Hey, I wanted
you to know...

1521
01:41:04,720 --> 01:41:06,324
you weren't boring me.

1522
01:41:07,200 --> 01:41:08,725
That day in the park.

1523
01:41:10,200 --> 01:41:11,406
I was...

1524
01:41:12,800 --> 01:41:13,801
I was thinking about...

1525
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:18,164
I hope this doesn't sound weird,
but I was thinking about you.

1526
01:41:20,080 --> 01:41:23,562
When I was in Greenland,
they do karaoke there...

1527
01:41:24,240 --> 01:41:29,326
and I had to get on this helicopter,
with a very drunk pilot.

1528
01:41:30,200 --> 01:41:32,851
And I started
to imagine you...

1529
01:41:33,520 --> 01:41:35,568
singing Major Tom.

1530
01:41:38,360 --> 01:41:40,010
Anyway...

1531
01:41:40,920 --> 01:41:43,082
it got me
on the helicopter.

1532
01:41:43,280 --> 01:41:47,365
And it got me
where I wanted to go.

1533
01:41:49,880 --> 01:41:50,881
So, what happened
to you?

1534
01:41:51,080 --> 01:41:54,289
You sort of fell off
the face of the Earth there.

1535
01:41:54,440 --> 01:41:55,885
For a little bit.

1536
01:41:56,520 --> 01:41:58,682
I came by and...

1537
01:41:58,880 --> 01:42:01,690
your husband answered so
I figured I should just go.

1538
01:42:03,080 --> 01:42:06,402
Phil. He was
fixing my refrigerator.

1539
01:42:06,560 --> 01:42:08,369
And he's not
my husband.

1540
01:42:09,760 --> 01:42:11,728
I guess I imagined...

1541
01:42:13,600 --> 01:42:15,887
I thought maybe you
got back together.

1542
01:42:16,600 --> 01:42:18,728
You have a good
imagination.

1543
01:42:18,880 --> 01:42:20,405
But no.

1544
01:42:22,960 --> 01:42:25,566
Hey, my sister got
this role in Grease.

1545
01:42:25,720 --> 01:42:26,926
Rizzo.

1546
01:42:27,080 --> 01:42:29,447
Not on Broadway.
In some weird church.

1547
01:42:32,400 --> 01:42:33,970
Do you want
to go with me?

1548
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:36,604
I made that sound
really not good.

1549
01:42:36,760 --> 01:42:37,966
Yeah.

1550
01:42:38,840 --> 01:42:40,080
Yeah?

1551
01:42:40,400 --> 01:42:43,449
Yeah, yeah.
I would love to.

1552
01:42:43,600 --> 01:42:46,444
Grease in a weird church?
Are you kidding?

1553
01:42:46,600 --> 01:42:48,762
Rizzo, that's
the best part.

1554
01:42:49,080 --> 01:42:52,004
Yeah, Rizzo.
Tough and tender.

1555
01:42:52,160 --> 01:42:53,605
Yeah.

1556
01:42:54,400 --> 01:42:55,765
Great.

1557
01:42:56,480 --> 01:42:58,687
Are you heading Uptown?

1558
01:42:59,360 --> 01:43:00,361
Sure.

1559
01:43:00,440 --> 01:43:01,441
Yeah?

1560
01:43:03,520 --> 01:43:05,602
I actually always
related to Rizzo more.

1561
01:43:05,760 --> 01:43:07,285
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

1562
01:43:07,440 --> 01:43:10,523
Was it the smoking
and the teenage sex?

1563
01:43:10,680 --> 01:43:13,604
No. She was
just real, I guess.

1564
01:43:13,760 --> 01:43:14,761
Oh!

1565
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:18,163
The last issue, it should be here.
It came out this morning.

1566
01:43:38,960 --> 01:43:41,281
Man. Walter.

1567
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,367
Should we go buy
one of those?

1568
01:44:02,520 --> 01:44:04,284
Yeah. I was
probably gonna...

1569
01:44:04,440 --> 01:44:06,124
Probably gonna go back later?
Yeah.

1570
01:44:06,280 --> 01:44:10,001
I just didn't want to seem
uncool and get one right away.

1571
01:44:41,720 --> 01:44:45,167
<i>There's a rhythm

with nothing but dreams</i>

1603
01:48:28,280 --> 01:48:32,285
<i>In a world gone shallow
In a world gone lean</i>

1604
01:48:35,240 --> 01:48:38,483
<i>But there is a truth
and it's on our side</i>

1605
01:48:41,720 --> 01:48:44,963
<i>Dawn is coming, open your eyes</i>

1606
01:48:48,240 --> 01:48:52,450
<i>Look into the sun
as a new days rise</i>

1607
01:49:02,520 --> 01:49:05,364
<i>Step outside,
I'm gonna step outside</i>

1608
01:49:09,160 --> 01:49:12,209
<i>Step outside,
I'm gonna step outside</i>

1609
01:49:25,960 --> 01:49:28,964
<i>Heart's on fire,
leave it all behind you</i>

1610
01:49:39,160 --> 01:49:42,562
<i>Dark as night,
let the lightning guide you</i>

1611
01:49:49,280 --> 01:49:52,045
<i>Step outside,
I'm gonna step outside</i>

1612
01:49:59,160 --> 01:50:02,607
<i>Heart's on fire,
leave it all behind you</i>

1613
01:50:03,320 --> 01:50:08,929
<i>Living life
Feeding appetites</i>

1614
01:50:09,760 --> 01:50:15,290
<i>Stake through every heart
stop in the mood</i>

1615
01:50:16,680 --> 01:50:19,081
<i>Being glad</i>

1616
01:50:19,840 --> 01:50:22,810
<i>Breathing half the time</i>

1617
01:50:32,560 --> 01:50:35,803
<i>Heart's on fire,
leave it all behind you</i>

1618
01:50:45,520 --> 01:50:49,161
<i>Dark as night,
let the lightning guide you</i>

1619
01:50:49,280 --> 01:50:51,851
<i>Step outside,
I'm gonna step outside</i>

1620
01:51:19,480 --> 01:51:22,484
<i>Broke to Monday</i>

1621
01:51:22,760 --> 01:51:25,127
<i>Somethings not the same</i>

1622
01:51:26,080 --> 01:51:27,969
<i>Blank head</i>

1623
01:51:28,080 --> 01:51:30,765
<i>Cross tiles sweep the floor</i>

1624
01:51:32,720 --> 01:51:37,487
<i>Feel your presence
in your absence</i>

1625
01:51:37,760 --> 01:51:39,285
<i>Shut the door</i>

1626
01:51:48,560 --> 01:51:51,962
<i>Heart's on fire,
leave it all behind you</i>

1627
01:52:01,840 --> 01:52:05,208
<i>Dark as night,
let the lightning guide you</i>

1628
01:52:08,240 --> 01:52:11,767
<i>Must believe in</i>

1629
01:52:11,840 --> 01:52:14,810
<i>Step outside
Take a step outside</i>

1630
01:52:14,880 --> 01:52:16,484
<i>Take a step outside</i>

1631
01:52:21,560 --> 01:52:25,042
<i>Must believe in</i>

1632
01:52:25,120 --> 01:52:28,090
<i>Step outside
Take a step outside</i>

1633
01:52:28,160 --> 01:52:29,764
<i>Take a step outside</i>

1634
01:52:35,320 --> 01:52:38,688
<i>Heart's on fire,
leave it all behind you</i>

1635
01:53:06,120 --> 01:53:08,487
<i>You know I love my lady</i>

1636
01:53:09,800 --> 01:53:11,928
<i>We've been together so long</i>

1637
01:53:13,360 --> 01:53:15,840
<i>Like a worn-out recording</i>

1638
01:53:17,120 --> 01:53:18,929
<i>Of my favorite song</i>

1639
01:53:20,400 --> 01:53:22,846
<i>So while she lay
there sleepin'</i>

1640
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:25,923
<i>I read the paper in bed</i>

1641
01:53:27,480 --> 01:53:30,051
<i>And in the personal columns,</i>

1642
01:53:31,040 --> 01:53:32,963
<i>There was this letter
that read</i>

1643
01:53:34,640 --> 01:53:37,371
<i>If you like pina coladas</i>

1644
01:53:38,280 --> 01:53:40,328
<i>Or getting caught in the rain</i>

1645
01:53:42,040 --> 01:53:44,441
<i>And the feel of the ocean</i>

1646
01:53:45,560 --> 01:53:47,722
<i>And the taste of champagne</i>

1647
01:53:48,880 --> 01:53:51,281
<i>If you like making love
at midnight</i>

1648
01:53:52,560 --> 01:53:54,722
<i>In the dunes of the cape</i>

1649
01:53:55,960 --> 01:53:58,691
<i>Then you're the lady
that I look for</i>

1650
01:53:59,760 --> 01:54:01,842
<i>Come with me and escape</i>
