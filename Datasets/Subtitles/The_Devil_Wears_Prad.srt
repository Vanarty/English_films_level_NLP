1
00:01:58,991 --> 00:02:00,367
Good luck.

2
00:03:39,216 --> 00:03:42,136
Hi. I have an appointment with...

3
00:03:42,303 --> 00:03:43,637
...Emily Charlton?

4
00:03:44,763 --> 00:03:47,266
- Andrea Sachs?
- Yes?

5
00:03:47,433 --> 00:03:51,854
Great. Human Resources certainly has
an odd sense of humor. Follow me.

6
00:03:54,064 --> 00:03:56,901
Okay. So I was Miranda's
second assistant...

7
00:03:57,067 --> 00:04:00,070
...but her first recently got promoted,
and now I'm the first.

8
00:04:00,237 --> 00:04:02,448
- You're replacing yourself.
- Well, I am trying.

9
00:04:02,615 --> 00:04:05,117
Miranda sacked the last two girls
after a few weeks.

10
00:04:05,284 --> 00:04:07,077
We need someone
who can survive here.

11
00:04:07,244 --> 00:04:09,830
- Do you understand?
- Yeah, of course. Who's Miranda?

12
00:04:10,372 --> 00:04:13,125
Oh, my God. I will pretend
you did not just ask me that.

13
00:04:13,292 --> 00:04:16,879
She's the editor in chief of Runway.
Not to mention, a legend.

14
00:04:17,046 --> 00:04:20,257
Work a year for her and you can get
a job at any magazine you want.

15
00:04:20,466 --> 00:04:24,136
- A million girls would kill for this.
- It sounds like a great opportunity.

16
00:04:24,303 --> 00:04:26,347
I'd love to be considered.

17
00:04:28,057 --> 00:04:29,642
Andrea...

18
00:04:29,808 --> 00:04:34,647
...Runway is a fashion magazine,
so an interest in fashion is crucial.

19
00:04:34,855 --> 00:04:37,107
What makes you think
I'm not interested in fashion?

20
00:04:40,152 --> 00:04:41,529
Oh, my God.

21
00:04:41,695 --> 00:04:43,113
No, no, no!

22
00:04:44,532 --> 00:04:46,367
What's wrong?

23
00:04:50,621 --> 00:04:53,332
She's on her way. Tell everyone.

24
00:04:53,499 --> 00:04:55,668
She's not supposed to be here until 9.

25
00:04:55,835 --> 00:04:59,046
Her driver just text-messaged,
and her facialist ruptured a disk.

26
00:04:59,213 --> 00:05:01,382
God, these people.

27
00:05:01,549 --> 00:05:04,176
- Who 's that?
- That I can't even talk about.

28
00:05:05,845 --> 00:05:08,264
All right, everyone. Gird your loins!

29
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:12,017
Did someone eat an onion bagel?

30
00:06:13,704 --> 00:06:15,831
Sorry, Miranda.

31
00:06:26,675 --> 00:06:28,594
Move it.

32
00:06:29,762 --> 00:06:33,182
I don't understand why
it's so difficult to confirm appointments.

33
00:06:33,349 --> 00:06:35,184
I'm so sorry. I actually did confirm...

34
00:06:35,351 --> 00:06:38,062
Details of your incompetence
do not interest me.

35
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:42,024
Tell Simone I won't approve that girl
she sent me for the Brazilian layout.

36
00:06:42,233 --> 00:06:45,694
I asked for clean, athletic, smiley.
She sent dirty, tired and paunchy.

37
00:06:45,903 --> 00:06:47,821
R.S.V.P. "yes" to
the Michael Kors party.

38
00:06:47,988 --> 00:06:52,034
I want the driver to drop me off at 9:30
and pick me up at 9:45 sharp.

39
00:06:52,201 --> 00:06:55,663
Then call Natalie at Glorious Foods
and tell her "no" for the 40th time.

40
00:06:55,829 --> 00:06:59,124
I don't want dacquoise. I want tortes
filled with rhubarb compote.

41
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:02,795
Call my ex and remind him the
parent-teacher conference is at Dalton.

42
00:07:03,003 --> 00:07:05,548
Then call my husband,
ask him to meet me for dinner...

43
00:07:05,756 --> 00:07:07,675
...at that place I went to
with Massimo.

44
00:07:07,842 --> 00:07:09,844
Tell Richard I saw
the pictures he sent...

45
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:12,221
...for that feature
on female paratroopers...

46
00:07:12,388 --> 00:07:14,056
...and they're all so unattractive.

47
00:07:14,265 --> 00:07:16,267
Is it impossible to find a lovely...

48
00:07:16,433 --> 00:07:18,102
...slender female paratrooper?
- No.

49
00:07:18,269 --> 00:07:19,854
- Am I reaching for the stars?
- No.

50
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:21,313
Not really. Also...

51
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:24,316
...I need to see all the things that
Nigel has pulled...

52
00:07:24,483 --> 00:07:26,151
...for Gwyneth's second cover try.

53
00:07:26,318 --> 00:07:29,154
I wonder if she's lost any of
that weight yet. Who is that?

54
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:31,031
Nobody.

55
00:07:31,198 --> 00:07:34,201
Well, Human Resources sent her up
about the new assistant job.

56
00:07:34,368 --> 00:07:36,370
I was sort of
preinterviewing her for you.

57
00:07:36,537 --> 00:07:38,747
But she's hopeless
and totally wrong for this...

58
00:07:38,914 --> 00:07:40,916
Well, clearly, I have to
do that myself.

59
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:43,961
The last two you sent me
were completely inadequate...

60
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:46,005
...so send her in.

61
00:07:46,172 --> 00:07:47,464
That's all.

62
00:07:48,632 --> 00:07:49,675
Right.

63
00:07:53,762 --> 00:07:55,973
- She wants to see you.
- She does?

64
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:57,933
Move.

65
00:08:00,936 --> 00:08:02,688
This is foul. Don't let her see it.

66
00:08:02,855 --> 00:08:04,857
- That's my...
- Go.

67
00:08:12,323 --> 00:08:13,449
Who are you?

68
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:15,993
My name is Andy Sachs.

69
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,205
I recently graduated from
Northwestern University.

70
00:08:19,413 --> 00:08:22,041
And what are you doing here?

71
00:08:22,249 --> 00:08:26,629
Well, I think I could do a good job
as your assistant.

72
00:08:27,213 --> 00:08:29,298
And...

73
00:08:30,799 --> 00:08:34,470
I came to New York to be a journalist,
and sent letters out everywhere...

74
00:08:34,637 --> 00:08:36,805
...and finally got a call
from Elias-Clarke...

75
00:08:37,014 --> 00:08:39,517
...and met with Sherry
up at Human Resources and...

76
00:08:40,601 --> 00:08:42,978
Basically, it's this or Auto Universe.

77
00:08:43,187 --> 00:08:47,316
- So you don't read Runway?
- No.

78
00:08:47,483 --> 00:08:53,113
- Before today, you'd never heard of me?
- No.

79
00:08:53,322 --> 00:08:56,367
And you have no style
or sense of fashion.

80
00:08:57,576 --> 00:08:59,203
Well...

81
00:08:59,787 --> 00:09:01,705
I think that depends on
what you're...

82
00:09:01,872 --> 00:09:04,750
No, no. That wasn't a question.

83
00:09:08,379 --> 00:09:11,340
I was editor in chief of
The Daily Northwestern.

84
00:09:11,507 --> 00:09:15,845
I also won a national competition for
college journalists with my series...

85
00:09:16,053 --> 00:09:17,721
...on the janitors' union...

86
00:09:17,888 --> 00:09:20,891
...which exposed the exploitation of...
- That's all.

87
00:09:27,815 --> 00:09:31,485
Yeah, you know, okay.
You're right. I don't fit in here.

88
00:09:31,652 --> 00:09:37,157
I am not skinny or glamorous and
I don't know that much about fashion...

89
00:09:37,324 --> 00:09:39,743
...but I'm smart.

90
00:09:39,952 --> 00:09:42,955
- I learn fast and work very hard.
- I've got the exclusive on...

91
00:09:43,122 --> 00:09:44,415
...the Cavalli for Gwyneth.

92
00:09:44,582 --> 00:09:47,793
The problem is, with that huge
feathered headdress she's wearing...

93
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:51,046
...she looks like she's working
the stage at the Golden Nugget.

94
00:09:51,213 --> 00:09:54,466
Thank you for your time.

95
00:09:54,675 --> 00:09:57,595
Who is that sad little person?

96
00:09:57,761 --> 00:10:00,472
Are we doing a before-and-after piece
I don't know about?

97
00:10:11,066 --> 00:10:12,401
Andrea.

98
00:10:17,364 --> 00:10:20,159
Wait. You got a job
at a fashion magazine?

99
00:10:20,326 --> 00:10:22,703
Well, what was it, a phone interview?

100
00:10:23,495 --> 00:10:25,956
- Don't be a jerk.
- No, I'm just...

101
00:10:26,123 --> 00:10:28,751
Miranda Priestly is famous
for being unpredictable.

102
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:31,795
Okay, Doug. How is it that
you know who she is and I didn't?

103
00:10:32,004 --> 00:10:33,297
I'm actually a girl.

104
00:10:34,048 --> 00:10:35,966
That would explain so much.

105
00:10:36,175 --> 00:10:38,511
Look, seriously,
Miranda Priestly is a huge deal.

106
00:10:38,677 --> 00:10:40,638
A million girls would kill for that job.

107
00:10:40,846 --> 00:10:43,599
Yeah, great.
The thing is, I'm not one of them.

108
00:10:43,807 --> 00:10:46,143
Well, look.
You gotta start somewhere, right?

109
00:10:46,352 --> 00:10:48,229
I mean, look at this dump
Nate works in.

110
00:10:48,395 --> 00:10:51,065
I mean, come on.
Paper napkins? Hello?

111
00:10:51,273 --> 00:10:54,735
Yeah, and Lily, she works at
that gallery, doing... You know...

112
00:10:54,902 --> 00:10:58,155
Oh, I'm sorry.
What exactly is it that you do, anyway?

113
00:10:58,322 --> 00:11:01,408
Well, lucky for me,
I already have my dream job.

114
00:11:02,409 --> 00:11:05,204
- You're a corporate research analyst.
- Research analyst.

115
00:11:05,788 --> 00:11:07,706
- Oh, you're right. My job sucks.
- No.

116
00:11:07,873 --> 00:11:10,709
- It sucks. I don't... It's boring.
- It's all right. Breathe.

117
00:11:10,876 --> 00:11:12,127
- I'm trying.
- Take a drink.

118
00:11:12,336 --> 00:11:15,130
- I will have a drink.
- I would like to propose a toast.

119
00:11:15,339 --> 00:11:16,715
To jobs that pay the rent.

120
00:11:16,924 --> 00:11:20,636
- To jobs that pay the rent.
- Yes. To jobs that pay the rent.

121
00:11:20,845 --> 00:11:24,473
Oh, baby. You should see the way
these girls at Runway dress.

122
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,433
I don't have a thing to wear to work.

123
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,769
You'll be answering phones
and getting coffee.

124
00:11:28,936 --> 00:11:31,272
You need a ball gown for that?

125
00:11:31,438 --> 00:11:33,357
I think I might.

126
00:11:33,524 --> 00:11:37,111
Well, I happen to think
you look great always.

127
00:11:38,904 --> 00:11:41,282
I think you're full of it.

128
00:11:42,825 --> 00:11:44,201
- Hey. Come on.
- Yeah.

129
00:11:44,368 --> 00:11:46,954
Let's go. I can think of
something we can do...

130
00:11:47,121 --> 00:11:50,249
...that doesn't require any clothing.
- Really?

131
00:11:57,923 --> 00:11:59,717
- Hello?
- Andrea.

132
00:11:59,925 --> 00:12:02,887
Miranda decided to kill
the autumn jacket story for September.

133
00:12:03,053 --> 00:12:05,264
She's putting up
the Sedona shoot from October.

134
00:12:05,431 --> 00:12:07,183
Come into the office this second.

135
00:12:07,391 --> 00:12:09,518
- Pick up her coffee order on the way.
- Now?

136
00:12:09,727 --> 00:12:11,395
Now, get a pen and write this down:

137
00:12:11,604 --> 00:12:14,231
I want one no-foam, skimmed latte...

138
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:17,359
...with an extra shot and
three coffees with room for milk.

139
00:12:17,568 --> 00:12:20,654
Searing hot. And I mean hot.

140
00:12:25,409 --> 00:12:27,286
- Hello?
- Where are you?

141
00:12:27,453 --> 00:12:29,288
I'm almost there. Yeah.

142
00:12:29,914 --> 00:12:31,582
Shoot.

143
00:12:35,628 --> 00:12:38,631
Is there some reason
that my coffee isn't here?

144
00:12:38,839 --> 00:12:40,674
Has she died or something?

145
00:12:40,883 --> 00:12:43,844
No. God...

146
00:12:48,224 --> 00:12:50,684
Oh, about bloody time.

147
00:12:51,644 --> 00:12:55,564
I hope you know this is a very difficult
job for which you are totally wrong.

148
00:12:55,773 --> 00:12:58,234
If you mess up,
my head is on the chopping block.

149
00:12:58,692 --> 00:13:01,070
Now, hang that up.
Don't just fling it anywhere.

150
00:13:02,446 --> 00:13:05,407
- All right, where's the other layout?
- It's on its way.

151
00:13:05,616 --> 00:13:08,994
This is the first part of the collection,
which we talked about...

152
00:13:12,289 --> 00:13:14,917
Okay. First of all,
you and I answer the phones.

153
00:13:15,084 --> 00:13:18,170
The phone must be answered
every single time it rings.

154
00:13:18,379 --> 00:13:21,298
Calls roll to voice mail,
and she gets very upset.

155
00:13:21,507 --> 00:13:23,676
If I'm not here... Andrea, Andrea.

156
00:13:23,884 --> 00:13:25,386
- You are chained to that desk.

157
00:13:25,553 --> 00:13:27,763
Well, what if I need to...?

158
00:13:27,972 --> 00:13:30,307
What? No. One time,
an assistant left the desk...

159
00:13:30,474 --> 00:13:33,185
...because she sliced her hand open
with a letter opener.

160
00:13:33,394 --> 00:13:35,271
And Miranda missed Lagerfeld...

161
00:13:35,437 --> 00:13:38,399
...just before he boarded
a 17-hour flight to Australia.

162
00:13:38,566 --> 00:13:41,402
She now works at TV Guide.

163
00:13:42,486 --> 00:13:45,114
Man the desk at all times, got it.

164
00:13:48,492 --> 00:13:50,536
Miranda Priestly's office.

165
00:13:50,703 --> 00:13:51,996
No, she's not available.

166
00:13:52,204 --> 00:13:53,789
Who is...?

167
00:13:55,875 --> 00:13:57,835
Yes, I will tell her you called.

168
00:13:58,002 --> 00:14:00,045
Yet again.

169
00:14:01,172 --> 00:14:03,674
Remember,
you and I have totally different jobs.

170
00:14:03,883 --> 00:14:06,719
I mean, you get coffee
and you run errands.

171
00:14:06,886 --> 00:14:08,470
I am in charge of her schedule...

172
00:14:08,637 --> 00:14:11,432
...her appointments
and her expenses...

173
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:15,936
...and most importantly, I get to go with
her to Paris for Fashion Week in the fall.

174
00:14:16,604 --> 00:14:19,398
I get to wear couture.
I go to all the shows and parties.

175
00:14:19,565 --> 00:14:22,067
I meet all of the designers.
It's divine.

176
00:14:23,444 --> 00:14:25,154
Okay, now, stay here.

177
00:14:25,362 --> 00:14:28,574
I'm going to the Art Department
to give them the Book.

178
00:14:28,741 --> 00:14:32,119
- The...?
- This is the Book.

179
00:14:32,286 --> 00:14:36,332
Now, it is a mockup of
everything in the current issue.

180
00:14:36,499 --> 00:14:40,169
We deliver it to Miranda's apartment
every night and she retu... Don't touch.

181
00:14:40,336 --> 00:14:42,838
She returns it to us in the morning
with her notes.

182
00:14:43,005 --> 00:14:46,217
Now, second assistant
is supposed to do this...

183
00:14:46,383 --> 00:14:50,221
...but Miranda is very private and
she does not like strangers in her house.

184
00:14:50,429 --> 00:14:53,390
So until she decides that
you're not a total psycho...

185
00:14:53,557 --> 00:14:55,726
...I get the lovely task of
waiting around for the Book.

186
00:14:58,312 --> 00:15:01,315
- Emily? What do I do if...?
- Deal with it.

187
00:15:06,487 --> 00:15:09,406
Hello, Mrs. Priestly's office.

188
00:15:10,074 --> 00:15:12,326
That's what I meant.
Miranda Priestly's office.

189
00:15:14,662 --> 00:15:18,457
You know, she is in a meeting.
Could I please take a message?

190
00:15:21,293 --> 00:15:22,878
Okay.

191
00:15:23,045 --> 00:15:25,756
Can you please spell "Gabbana"?

192
00:15:26,298 --> 00:15:27,925
Hello?

193
00:15:28,843 --> 00:15:30,344
Guess not.

194
00:15:31,804 --> 00:15:34,306
I guessed an eight and a half.

195
00:15:34,473 --> 00:15:37,184
Wow, that's very nice of you.

196
00:15:37,393 --> 00:15:39,937
But I don't think I need these.
Miranda hired me.

197
00:15:40,104 --> 00:15:42,523
- She knows what I look like.
- Do you?

198
00:15:46,777 --> 00:15:48,737
Emily.

199
00:15:49,029 --> 00:15:50,739
Emily?

200
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:53,492
She means you.

201
00:15:56,704 --> 00:16:00,249
- We just cut on the bias and so what...
- No, that's not what I asked you.

202
00:16:00,416 --> 00:16:04,003
There you are, Emily. How many times
do I have to scream your name?

203
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:05,379
Actually, it's Andy.

204
00:16:07,673 --> 00:16:11,844
My name is Andy.
Andrea, but everybody calls me Andy.

205
00:16:15,055 --> 00:16:19,518
- I need 10 or 15 skirts from Calvin Klein.
- Okay. What kind of skirts do you...?

206
00:16:19,685 --> 00:16:22,479
Please bore someone else
with your questions.

207
00:16:22,646 --> 00:16:26,192
And make sure we have Pier 59
at 8 a.m. Tomorrow.

208
00:16:26,358 --> 00:16:30,112
Remind Jocelyn I need to see those
satchels that Marc is doing in the pony.

209
00:16:30,279 --> 00:16:33,407
And then tell Simone I'll take Jackie
if Maggie isn't available.

210
00:16:33,574 --> 00:16:35,159
Did Demarchelier confirm?

211
00:16:36,368 --> 00:16:38,787
- Did Demarcheli...?
- Demarchelier. Did he...

212
00:16:38,954 --> 00:16:40,498
Get him on the phone.

213
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:43,501
Okay.

214
00:16:44,502 --> 00:16:45,961
And, Emily...

215
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:47,463
Yes?

216
00:16:59,016 --> 00:17:00,100
That's all.

217
00:17:01,101 --> 00:17:02,811
It's the cavalier disregard for...

218
00:17:11,737 --> 00:17:13,447
Do you have Demarchelier?

219
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,491
Demarchelier.

220
00:17:15,699 --> 00:17:17,284
Leave it.

221
00:17:17,451 --> 00:17:19,078
Do you have...? Oh.

222
00:17:21,288 --> 00:17:25,209
I have Miranda Priestly calling.
I have Patrick!

223
00:17:27,461 --> 00:17:30,548
She called me in there and then
she asked me about Pier 59.

224
00:17:30,714 --> 00:17:34,635
And there was something
about Simone, Frankie, someone else.

225
00:17:34,802 --> 00:17:37,930
And she needs skirts
from Calvin Klein.

226
00:17:38,347 --> 00:17:41,642
And there was something
about a pony.

227
00:17:42,101 --> 00:17:44,270
- Did she say which skirts?
- No.

228
00:17:44,436 --> 00:17:46,522
- Did she say what kind?
- I tried to ask her.

229
00:17:46,689 --> 00:17:48,983
You may never ask Miranda anything.

230
00:17:49,149 --> 00:17:53,195
Right. I will deal with all of this,
and you will go to Calvin Klein.

231
00:17:55,114 --> 00:17:56,615
- Me?
- Oh, I'm sorry.

232
00:17:56,782 --> 00:17:58,450
Do you have some prior commitment?

233
00:17:58,617 --> 00:18:00,995
Some hideous-skirt convention
you have to go to?

234
00:18:16,844 --> 00:18:18,179
- Miranda?
- Are you there?

235
00:18:18,345 --> 00:18:21,223
I'm about to walk in.
I'll call you as soon as I...

236
00:18:24,894 --> 00:18:26,228
- Hello?
- While you're out...

237
00:18:26,395 --> 00:18:30,191
...Miranda needs you to go to Hermès
to pick up 25 scarves we ordered for her.

238
00:18:30,357 --> 00:18:33,194
Cassidy forgot her homework at Dalton.
Pick that up.

239
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,070
Miranda went out
to meet with Meisel.

240
00:18:35,237 --> 00:18:37,406
She'll want more Starbucks
when she gets back.

241
00:18:37,573 --> 00:18:41,202
- Hot Starbucks.
- Can you just repeat that first...? Hello?

242
00:18:45,873 --> 00:18:47,917
Oh, my God.

243
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:50,669
What took you so long?
I have to pee.

244
00:18:50,836 --> 00:18:52,505
- You haven't peed since I left?
- No.

245
00:18:52,671 --> 00:18:55,174
Been manning the desk, haven't I?
I'm bursting.

246
00:19:00,179 --> 00:19:01,972
Oh, hi.

247
00:19:03,641 --> 00:19:06,977
- You do coat. Do the coat.
- Okay.

248
00:19:08,187 --> 00:19:11,440
Be prepared. The run-through
is at 12:30, and people are panicking.

249
00:19:11,607 --> 00:19:14,151
So the phone is going
to be ringing off the hook.

250
00:19:14,318 --> 00:19:15,945
The run-through. Right.

251
00:19:16,487 --> 00:19:19,615
Yes. Editors bring in options
for the shoot, and Miranda chooses.

252
00:19:19,782 --> 00:19:22,284
She chooses every single thing
in every single issue.

253
00:19:22,451 --> 00:19:25,246
It's a huge deal. I don't know
why you don't know that.

254
00:19:25,412 --> 00:19:27,248
- Okay, are you ready?
- Oh, hi, hi.

255
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:30,626
Right, well, after the loo,
Serena and I are going to lunch.

256
00:19:30,793 --> 00:19:32,795
- This is her, the new me.
- Hi.

257
00:19:32,962 --> 00:19:35,005
- Told you.
- I thought you were kidding.

258
00:19:35,172 --> 00:19:36,882
No, quite serious, yeah.

259
00:19:37,049 --> 00:19:39,134
I get 20 minutes for lunch,
and you get 15.

260
00:19:39,301 --> 00:19:41,554
- When I come back, you can go.
- Okay.

261
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:45,891
- What exactly is she wearing?
- Her grandmother's skirt.

262
00:19:58,362 --> 00:20:01,532
Corn chowder.
That's an interesting choice.

263
00:20:01,907 --> 00:20:06,370
You do know that cellulite is one of
the main ingredients in corn chowder?

264
00:20:11,584 --> 00:20:13,294
None of the girls here eat anything?

265
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:17,464
Not since two became the new four
and zero became the new two.

266
00:20:17,631 --> 00:20:19,133
Well, I'm a six.

267
00:20:19,967 --> 00:20:22,344
Which is the new 14.

268
00:20:25,931 --> 00:20:27,641
- Shoot.
- Oh, never mind.

269
00:20:27,808 --> 00:20:31,687
I'm sure you have plenty more poly blend
where that came from.

270
00:20:32,646 --> 00:20:33,939
Okay.

271
00:20:34,106 --> 00:20:36,275
You think my clothes are hideous,
I get it.

272
00:20:36,442 --> 00:20:39,486
But, you know, I'm not
going to be in fashion forever...

273
00:20:39,653 --> 00:20:43,657
...so I don't see the point of changing
myself just because I have this job.

274
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,534
Yes, that's true.

275
00:20:45,701 --> 00:20:49,455
That's what this multi-billion-dollar
industry is all about, anyway, isn't it?

276
00:20:49,622 --> 00:20:50,956
Inner beauty.

277
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:55,753
Hello?

278
00:20:56,712 --> 00:20:58,172
Right. Come on.

279
00:20:58,339 --> 00:21:00,925
Miranda's pushed the run-through
up a half an hour.

280
00:21:01,133 --> 00:21:02,635
She's always 15 minutes early.

281
00:21:02,801 --> 00:21:04,595
- Which means...?
- You're already late.

282
00:21:04,762 --> 00:21:07,515
- Come. Excuse me.
- Shoot!

283
00:21:09,642 --> 00:21:12,102
- Mr. Ravitz.
- Nigel.

284
00:21:13,562 --> 00:21:16,190
- Issue going well?
- Oh, yes. Our best September ever.

285
00:21:16,357 --> 00:21:21,612
Great. Heard Miranda killed autumn
jackets and pulled up the Sedona shoot.

286
00:21:21,779 --> 00:21:25,699
- What's that costing me?
- About 300,000.

287
00:21:26,283 --> 00:21:28,744
Must have been some lousy jackets.

288
00:21:29,912 --> 00:21:31,789
- Irv Ravitz.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

289
00:21:31,956 --> 00:21:34,041
This is Andy Sachs,
Miranda's new assistant.

290
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:38,754
Oh, congratulations, young lady.
A million girls would kill for that job.

291
00:21:38,921 --> 00:21:40,840
Bye-bye.

292
00:21:41,799 --> 00:21:44,718
Chairman of Elias-Clarke. Irv Ravitz.

293
00:21:44,885 --> 00:21:49,640
You know what they say:
Tiny man, huge ego.

294
00:21:52,351 --> 00:21:55,187
No. And I've seen all this before.

295
00:21:55,354 --> 00:21:58,190
Theyskens is trying to reinvent
the drop waist, so it's...

296
00:21:58,357 --> 00:22:01,318
- Where are all the other dresses?
- We have some right here.

297
00:22:01,485 --> 00:22:04,655
- Stand, watch and listen.
- I think it can be very interesting...

298
00:22:04,822 --> 00:22:05,865
No.

299
00:22:06,365 --> 00:22:08,993
No, I just...
It's just baffling to me.

300
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:12,079
Why is it so impossible
to put together a decent run-through?

301
00:22:12,246 --> 00:22:15,291
You people have had
hours and hours to prepare.

302
00:22:15,457 --> 00:22:19,837
It's just so confusing to me.
Where are the advertisers?

303
00:22:20,004 --> 00:22:23,090
- We have some pieces from Banana...
- We need more, don't we? Oh.

304
00:22:23,257 --> 00:22:24,800
This is...

305
00:22:24,967 --> 00:22:28,053
- This might be... What do you think of...?
- Yeah. You know me.

306
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:31,724
Give me a full ballerina skirt
and a hint of saloon, and I'm onboard.

307
00:22:31,891 --> 00:22:35,269
- But do you think it's too much like...?
- Like the Lacroix from July?

308
00:22:35,436 --> 00:22:38,189
I thought that, but no,
not with the right accessories.

309
00:22:38,355 --> 00:22:40,399
Where are the belts for this dress?

310
00:22:40,733 --> 00:22:42,985
Why is no one ready?

311
00:22:43,152 --> 00:22:47,615
Here. It's a tough call.
They're so different.

312
00:22:54,246 --> 00:22:55,581
Something funny?

313
00:22:59,126 --> 00:23:01,754
No. No, no, nothing's...

314
00:23:01,921 --> 00:23:06,050
You know, it's just that both those belts
look exactly the same to me.

315
00:23:06,217 --> 00:23:10,387
You know, I'm still
learning about this stuff and...

316
00:23:10,554 --> 00:23:13,265
"This stuff"?

317
00:23:14,099 --> 00:23:19,230
Oh, okay. I see. You think
this has nothing to do with you.

318
00:23:20,272 --> 00:23:22,691
You go to your closet...

319
00:23:22,858 --> 00:23:27,196
...and you select, I don't know,
that lumpy blue sweater, for instance...

320
00:23:27,363 --> 00:23:31,158
...because you're trying to tell the world
you take yourself too seriously...

321
00:23:31,325 --> 00:23:32,993
...to care about what you put on...

322
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:36,372
...but what you don't know is that
that sweater is not just blue.

323
00:23:36,539 --> 00:23:40,835
It's not turquoise. It's not lapis.
It's actually cerulean.

324
00:23:41,001 --> 00:23:43,212
And you're also blithely
unaware of the fact...

325
00:23:43,379 --> 00:23:47,424
...that in 2002, Oscar de la Renta
did a collection of cerulean gowns...

326
00:23:47,591 --> 00:23:51,762
...and then it was Yves Saint Laurent
who showed cerulean military jackets.

327
00:23:51,929 --> 00:23:53,389
I think we need a jacket here.

328
00:23:54,682 --> 00:23:58,727
Then cerulean quickly showed up in the
collections of eight different designers.

329
00:23:58,894 --> 00:24:02,022
And then it filtered down through
the department stores...

330
00:24:02,189 --> 00:24:06,360
...and then trickled on down
into some tragic Casual Corner...

331
00:24:06,527 --> 00:24:09,363
...where you, no doubt,
fished it out of some clearance bin.

332
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:14,201
However, that blue represents
millions of dollars and countless jobs.

333
00:24:14,368 --> 00:24:17,580
And it's sort of comical how you think
that you've made a choice...

334
00:24:17,746 --> 00:24:20,040
...that exempts you
from the fashion industry...

335
00:24:20,207 --> 00:24:23,586
...when, in fact, you're wearing
a sweater that was selected for you...

336
00:24:23,752 --> 00:24:26,547
...by the people in this room...

337
00:24:26,714 --> 00:24:29,049
...from a pile of "stuff."

338
00:24:29,675 --> 00:24:32,136
And then I said, no,
I couldn't see the difference...

339
00:24:32,303 --> 00:24:34,471
...between the two
absolutely identical belts.

340
00:24:34,638 --> 00:24:36,515
You should've seen
the look she gave me.

341
00:24:36,682 --> 00:24:39,852
I swear, I thought the flesh
was gonna melt off her face.

342
00:24:40,019 --> 00:24:41,395
It's not funny.

343
00:24:41,562 --> 00:24:45,608
She is not happy unless everyone around
her is panicked, nauseous or suicidal.

344
00:24:45,774 --> 00:24:48,736
And the clackers just worship her.

345
00:24:48,903 --> 00:24:50,738
- The who?
- They call them "clackers."

346
00:24:50,946 --> 00:24:53,616
The sound that their stilettos make
in the marble lobby.

347
00:24:53,782 --> 00:24:55,201
It's like:

348
00:24:57,161 --> 00:24:59,872
And they all act like
they're curing cancer or something.

349
00:25:00,039 --> 00:25:04,543
The amount of time and energy
that these people spend...

350
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:08,172
...on these insignificant, minute details.
And for what?

351
00:25:08,339 --> 00:25:11,217
So that tomorrow they can spend
another $300,000...

352
00:25:11,383 --> 00:25:14,011
...reshooting something
that was fine to begin with...

353
00:25:14,178 --> 00:25:18,432
...to sell people things
they don't need. God!

354
00:25:20,392 --> 00:25:23,395
- I'm not even hungry anymore.
- What?

355
00:25:23,562 --> 00:25:27,191
- That is why those girls are so skinny.
- Oh, no, no, no. Give me that.

356
00:25:27,358 --> 00:25:30,194
There's, like, $8 of Jarlsberg in there.

357
00:25:31,403 --> 00:25:33,072
Know what?

358
00:25:33,989 --> 00:25:36,408
I just have to stick it out for a year.
One year.

359
00:25:36,575 --> 00:25:39,119
And then I can do
what I came to New York to do.

360
00:25:39,495 --> 00:25:41,789
But I can't let Miranda get to me.
I won't.

361
00:25:41,956 --> 00:25:44,291
Easy there, tiger.

362
00:25:46,544 --> 00:25:49,588
- Oh, good morning, Miranda.
- Get me Isaac.

363
00:25:51,298 --> 00:25:53,884
I don't see my breakfast here.
Where are my eggs?

364
00:25:54,051 --> 00:25:55,678
Excuse me!

365
00:25:55,845 --> 00:25:58,806
Pick up the Polaroids
from the lingerie shoot.

366
00:25:59,014 --> 00:26:02,434
Have the brakes checked on my car.

367
00:26:05,062 --> 00:26:08,148
Where is that piece of paper
I had in my hand yesterday morning?

368
00:26:08,816 --> 00:26:10,192
Girls need new surfboards...

369
00:26:10,359 --> 00:26:13,195
...or boogie boards
or something for spring break.

370
00:26:13,821 --> 00:26:16,532
- Hello?
- The twins also need flip-flops.

371
00:26:19,743 --> 00:26:21,787
Pick up my shoes from Blahnik...

372
00:26:21,954 --> 00:26:24,540
...and then go get Patricia.
- Who's that?

373
00:26:24,707 --> 00:26:26,584
Good girl! Good girl! Good girl!

374
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:30,296
Get me that little table that I like
at that store on Madison.

375
00:26:30,462 --> 00:26:34,425
Get us a reservation for dinner tonight
at that place that got the good review.

376
00:26:34,592 --> 00:26:37,052
- Notes delivered today.
Where is everyone?

377
00:26:37,219 --> 00:26:40,347
Why is no one working?
- East Side.

378
00:26:41,515 --> 00:26:43,934
Get me Demarchelier.

379
00:26:50,149 --> 00:26:53,402
I have Miranda Priestly
calling for... Okay.

380
00:26:54,612 --> 00:26:56,739
I have Patrick.

381
00:27:02,495 --> 00:27:04,413
Thank God it's Friday, right?

382
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:08,751
At least Miranda will be in Miami, so we
don't have to be on call this weekend.

383
00:27:08,918 --> 00:27:10,920
You know, my dad's coming in
from Ohio.

384
00:27:11,086 --> 00:27:14,381
Yeah, we're gonna go out to dinner
and maybe see Chicago.

385
00:27:14,548 --> 00:27:16,258
You doing anything fun this weekend?

386
00:27:16,842 --> 00:27:18,260
Yes.

387
00:27:22,264 --> 00:27:24,225
Yeah, Nate said it was great.

388
00:27:24,391 --> 00:27:28,062
He actually... He applied here but they
wanted someone with more experience.

389
00:27:28,229 --> 00:27:30,189
- Here.
- What's this?

390
00:27:30,356 --> 00:27:32,858
I don't want you
to get behind on your rent.

391
00:27:33,025 --> 00:27:36,070
- Dad? How did you...?
- It's...

392
00:27:36,987 --> 00:27:39,114
I'm gonna kill Mom.

393
00:27:40,533 --> 00:27:42,117
Thank you.

394
00:27:46,539 --> 00:27:49,291
- It's really good to see you.
- You too, honey.

395
00:27:50,209 --> 00:27:54,630
So do you wanna start grilling me now,
or should we wait till after dinner?

396
00:27:54,797 --> 00:27:57,716
I thought I'd let you
at least enjoy the breadbasket first.

397
00:27:57,883 --> 00:27:59,844
No, no, no, that's okay.
Go right ahead.

398
00:28:00,469 --> 00:28:02,221
We're just a little worried, honey.

399
00:28:02,388 --> 00:28:04,932
We get e-mails from you
at your office at 2 a.m.

400
00:28:05,099 --> 00:28:07,643
Your pay is terrible.
You don't get to write anything.

401
00:28:07,810 --> 00:28:09,812
Hey, that's not fair.

402
00:28:09,979 --> 00:28:11,272
I wrote those e-mails.

403
00:28:12,356 --> 00:28:15,818
I'm trying to understand why someone
who got accepted to Stanford Law...

404
00:28:15,985 --> 00:28:19,822
...turns it down to be a journalist,
and now you're not even doing that.

405
00:28:19,989 --> 00:28:22,950
Dad, you have to trust me.

406
00:28:23,117 --> 00:28:25,911
Being Miranda's assistant
opens a lot of doors.

407
00:28:26,745 --> 00:28:29,540
Emily is going to Paris with Miranda
in a few months...

408
00:28:29,707 --> 00:28:33,502
...and she's gonna meet editors and
writers from every important magazine...

409
00:28:33,669 --> 00:28:35,546
...and in a year, that could be me.

410
00:28:36,672 --> 00:28:41,927
All right? Dad, I swear,
this is my break. This is my...

411
00:28:42,094 --> 00:28:44,471
My chance. This is...

412
00:28:44,638 --> 00:28:46,515
...my boss.

413
00:28:48,309 --> 00:28:50,769
I'm sorry, Dad. I have to take this.

414
00:28:50,936 --> 00:28:55,107
- Hello, Miranda?
- My flight has been cancelled.

415
00:28:55,274 --> 00:28:58,736
There's some absurd weather problem.
I need to get home tonight.

416
00:28:58,903 --> 00:29:01,405
The twins have a recital
tomorrow morning at school.

417
00:29:01,572 --> 00:29:02,990
- What?
- At school.

418
00:29:03,157 --> 00:29:05,826
- Absolutely. Let me see what I can do.
- Good.

419
00:29:05,993 --> 00:29:08,787
Hi. I know this is totally last minute...

420
00:29:08,954 --> 00:29:12,208
...but I was hoping that you could
maybe get a flight for my boss...

421
00:29:12,374 --> 00:29:14,668
...from Miami to New York tonight?

422
00:29:16,086 --> 00:29:19,006
- Yeah. Yeah, any kind of jet.
- Right here. Thank you.

423
00:29:19,173 --> 00:29:21,050
- From Miami to New York.
- Thank you.

424
00:29:21,217 --> 00:29:23,302
Yes, I need it tonight. I need it...

425
00:29:23,469 --> 00:29:26,347
- I thought you were going out...
- No. It's over here, honey.

426
00:29:26,514 --> 00:29:31,185
Hi, I'm trying to get a flight tonight,
for tonight, from Miami to New York.

427
00:29:31,352 --> 00:29:34,313
Yes, I know there's a hurricane.

428
00:29:34,897 --> 00:29:37,441
Nothing is flying out?
What do you mean, nothing?

429
00:29:37,608 --> 00:29:40,027
It's for Miranda Priestly.
She's a client of yours.

430
00:29:40,194 --> 00:29:42,196
She's flown with you before.
Yes, yes, hi.

431
00:29:42,363 --> 00:29:45,241
I need a jet tonight
from Miami to New York.

432
00:29:45,407 --> 00:29:47,618
- Yeah. Sorry, hold on.
- What?

433
00:29:47,785 --> 00:29:49,286
Hello? Miranda, hi.

434
00:29:49,453 --> 00:29:52,957
I'm trying to get a flight, but no one
is flying, because of the weather.

435
00:29:53,123 --> 00:29:56,919
Please. It's just,
I don't know, drizzling.

436
00:29:57,086 --> 00:29:58,796
Well, someone must be getting out.

437
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:00,756
Call Donatella. Get her jet.

438
00:30:00,923 --> 00:30:03,300
Call everybody else that we know
that has a jet.

439
00:30:03,467 --> 00:30:06,053
Call every... This is your respons...
This is your job.

440
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:08,097
Get me home.

441
00:30:08,556 --> 00:30:10,891
Oh, my God.
She's going to murder me.

442
00:30:11,058 --> 00:30:14,228
What does she want you to do,
have the National Guard airlift her?

443
00:30:14,395 --> 00:30:16,772
Of course not. Could I do that?

444
00:30:17,189 --> 00:30:18,899
Come on. Come on.

445
00:30:20,693 --> 00:30:23,320
The girls' recital
was absolutely wonderful.

446
00:30:23,487 --> 00:30:25,739
They played Rachmaninoff.
Everyone loved it.

447
00:30:25,906 --> 00:30:32,371
Everyone except me,
because, sadly, I was not there.

448
00:30:33,372 --> 00:30:36,876
- Miranda, I'm so sorry.
- Do you know why I hired you?

449
00:30:37,626 --> 00:30:40,045
I always hire the same girl.

450
00:30:40,212 --> 00:30:45,217
Stylish, slender, of course,
worships the magazine.

451
00:30:45,384 --> 00:30:48,596
But so often, they turn out to be...

452
00:30:48,762 --> 00:30:51,515
...I don't know, disappointing. And...

453
00:30:52,975 --> 00:30:54,310
...stupid.

454
00:30:55,352 --> 00:30:59,398
So you,
with that impressive résumé...

455
00:30:59,565 --> 00:31:02,526
...and the big speech
about your so-called work ethic...

456
00:31:02,693 --> 00:31:05,613
...I thought you would be different.

457
00:31:06,363 --> 00:31:10,951
I said to myself, "Go ahead.
Take a chance.

458
00:31:11,118 --> 00:31:14,371
Hire the smart fat girl."

459
00:31:16,332 --> 00:31:18,375
I had hope.

460
00:31:18,542 --> 00:31:20,628
My God, I live on it.

461
00:31:21,629 --> 00:31:25,508
Anyway, you ended up
disappointing me more than...

462
00:31:26,509 --> 00:31:28,928
More than any
of the other silly girls.

463
00:31:33,182 --> 00:31:35,518
I really did everything I could think of.

464
00:31:35,726 --> 00:31:37,978
That's all.

465
00:31:47,404 --> 00:31:49,907
Excuse me, where do you
think you're going?

466
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:11,470
She hates me, Nigel.

467
00:32:12,429 --> 00:32:16,767
And that's my problem because...
Oh, wait, no. It's not my problem.

468
00:32:16,976 --> 00:32:20,312
I don't know what else I can do
because if I do something right...

469
00:32:20,521 --> 00:32:23,148
...it's unacknowledged.
She doesn't even say thank you.

470
00:32:23,315 --> 00:32:28,362
But if I do something wrong,
she is vicious.

471
00:32:28,571 --> 00:32:30,489
So quit.

472
00:32:30,906 --> 00:32:32,324
What?

473
00:32:32,533 --> 00:32:34,326
- Quit.
- Qui...

474
00:32:34,535 --> 00:32:36,996
I can get a girl to take
your job in five minutes.

475
00:32:37,204 --> 00:32:38,956
One who really wants it.

476
00:32:39,165 --> 00:32:41,500
But no, I don't wanna quit.
That's not fair.

477
00:32:41,709 --> 00:32:44,211
But I... You know,
I'm just saying that...

478
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:48,591
...I would just like a little credit for
the fact that I'm killing myself trying.

479
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:52,636
Andy, be serious. You are not trying.

480
00:32:53,512 --> 00:32:56,515
You are whining.

481
00:32:57,474 --> 00:32:59,310
What do you want me
to say to you, huh?

482
00:32:59,810 --> 00:33:02,813
Do you want me to say, "Poor you,
Miranda's picking on you...

483
00:33:03,022 --> 00:33:05,065
...poor you, poor Andy"?

484
00:33:05,274 --> 00:33:09,445
Wake up, six. She's just doing her job.

485
00:33:09,653 --> 00:33:11,197
You are working at the place...

486
00:33:11,405 --> 00:33:14,408
...that published some of
the greatest artists of the century:

487
00:33:14,617 --> 00:33:17,828
Halston, Lagerfeld, de la Renta.

488
00:33:18,037 --> 00:33:23,250
And what they did, what they created,
was greater than art.

489
00:33:23,459 --> 00:33:25,294
Because you live your life in it.

490
00:33:26,837 --> 00:33:30,716
Well, not you, obviously.
But some people.

491
00:33:30,925 --> 00:33:35,721
You think this is just a magazine?
This is not just a magazine.

492
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:39,767
This is a shining beacon of hope for...

493
00:33:40,643 --> 00:33:41,894
Oh, I don't know.

494
00:33:42,061 --> 00:33:45,397
Let's say, a young boy growing up
in Rhode Island with six brothers...

495
00:33:45,564 --> 00:33:48,734
...pretending to go to soccer when he
was going to sewing class...

496
00:33:48,901 --> 00:33:52,071
...and reading Runway under the covers
at night with a flashlight.

497
00:33:52,279 --> 00:33:55,991
You have no idea how many legends
have walked these halls, and worse...

498
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,786
...you don't care. Because this place...

499
00:33:58,994 --> 00:34:03,916
...where so many people would die
to work, you only deign to work.

500
00:34:04,333 --> 00:34:07,670
And you want to know why she
doesn't kiss you on the forehead...

501
00:34:07,878 --> 00:34:12,174
...and give you a gold star on your
homework at the end of the day.

502
00:34:13,968 --> 00:34:16,387
Wake up, sweetheart.

503
00:34:22,935 --> 00:34:25,312
Okay, so I'm screwing it up.

504
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:30,985
I mean, I don't want to, I just wish
that I knew what I could do...

505
00:34:36,991 --> 00:34:40,161
Nigel? Nigel, Nigel.

506
00:34:42,663 --> 00:34:43,706
No.

507
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:46,750
I don't know what
you expect me to do.

508
00:34:46,959 --> 00:34:50,671
There's nothing in this closet that'll
fit a size six, I can guarantee you.

509
00:34:53,507 --> 00:34:56,468
These are all sample sizes,
two and four.

510
00:34:57,136 --> 00:34:59,096
All right, we're doing this for you...

511
00:34:59,305 --> 00:35:01,140
- And...
- A poncho?

512
00:35:01,515 --> 00:35:03,809
You'll take what I give you
and you'll like it.

513
00:35:04,018 --> 00:35:06,645
We're doing this Dolce for you.

514
00:35:07,062 --> 00:35:09,857
And shoes...

515
00:35:10,065 --> 00:35:11,483
Jimmy Choos.

516
00:35:12,735 --> 00:35:14,904
Manolo Blahnik.

517
00:35:15,821 --> 00:35:18,866
Nancy Gonzalez, love that.

518
00:35:19,074 --> 00:35:21,327
Okay, Narciso Rodriguez.
This we love.

519
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,914
- It might fit. It might.
- What?

520
00:35:25,122 --> 00:35:28,083
Okay, now Chanel. You're in
desperate need of Chanel.

521
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:30,920
Shall we? We have to get
to the Beauty Department...

522
00:35:31,086 --> 00:35:34,048
...and God knows how long
that's going to take.

523
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:37,801
I mean, I have no idea
why Miranda hired her.

524
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:40,638
Me neither. We were
in the Beauty Department...

525
00:35:40,846 --> 00:35:43,766
...and she held up the Shu Uemura
eyelash curler and said:

526
00:35:43,974 --> 00:35:45,726
"What is this?"

527
00:35:46,852 --> 00:35:49,522
I mean, I just knew from
the moment I saw her...

528
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:52,483
...she was going to be
a complete and utter disas...

529
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:04,912
Miranda Priestly's office.

530
00:36:05,621 --> 00:36:08,415
No, actually, she's not available
but I'll leave word.

531
00:36:08,624 --> 00:36:10,668
Okay, thanks. Bye.

532
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:14,296
How did...?

533
00:36:15,798 --> 00:36:17,925
- Are you wearing the Ch...
- The Chanel boots?

534
00:36:18,133 --> 00:36:20,636
Yeah, I am.

535
00:36:21,554 --> 00:36:23,430
You look good.

536
00:36:25,724 --> 00:36:27,601
What?

537
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:31,188
- She does.
- Oh, shut up, Serena.

538
00:36:33,774 --> 00:36:36,527
- See you guys tomorrow.
- Good night, man. Take it easy.

539
00:36:36,735 --> 00:36:38,946
Take care of that finger, huh?

540
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:57,673
So...

541
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:00,843
...what do you think?

542
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:06,307
I think we better get out of here
before my girlfriend sees me.

543
00:37:53,896 --> 00:37:56,690
The gowns are fabulous, Ralph.

544
00:37:57,733 --> 00:37:59,985
We're gonna use the burgundy...

545
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:07,159
...for the cover try...

546
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:14,583
So we spent a whole semester
on potatoes alone.

547
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:17,169
Take the fry and squeeze it.
See how firm that is?

548
00:38:17,336 --> 00:38:19,547
Hey. Oh, I'm so sorry I'm late.

549
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:23,133
There was a crisis
in the Accessories Department.

550
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:26,262
- I needed to find a python headband.
- Python's hot right now.

551
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:30,057
I have exciting presents for all of you.

552
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:32,434
Are you ready?

553
00:38:33,269 --> 00:38:36,522
- What is that?
- It's a Bang and Olufsen phone.

554
00:38:36,730 --> 00:38:39,191
Charlie Rose sent it to Miranda
for her birthday.

555
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:42,611
I looked it up online.
It's eleven hundred dollars.

556
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:44,405
- What?
- Yep.

557
00:38:44,613 --> 00:38:47,783
And I have some products.
Mason Pearson hairbrushes.

558
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:49,285
A little Clinique.

559
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:52,246
Oh, damn it, I love your job.

560
00:38:52,454 --> 00:38:53,831
Oh, one more...

561
00:38:54,039 --> 00:38:55,875
...little thing.

562
00:38:57,084 --> 00:38:59,587
- Do you want it? You want... Oh.
- Gimme, gimme, gimme!

563
00:38:59,753 --> 00:39:01,630
- I think she likes it.
- Oh, my God!

564
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:04,758
This is the new Marc Jacobs!
This is sold out everywhere.

565
00:39:04,925 --> 00:39:08,095
- Where did you get this?
- Miranda didn't want it, so...

566
00:39:08,304 --> 00:39:13,184
Oh, no, no, no. This bag is, like,
$ 1900. I cannot take this from you.

567
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:16,645
- Yeah, you can.
- Why do women need so many bags?

568
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:19,273
- Shut up.
- You have one, you put all your junk...

569
00:39:19,481 --> 00:39:22,818
...in it, and that's it, you're done.
- Fashion is not about utility.

570
00:39:22,985 --> 00:39:25,571
An accessory is merely
a piece of iconography...

571
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:27,781
...used to express individual identity.

572
00:39:28,824 --> 00:39:31,285
- And it's pretty.
- That too.

573
00:39:31,494 --> 00:39:35,039
It turns out that there is more
to Runway than just fancy purses.

574
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:39,126
Look. Here is an essay by Jay Mclnerney,
a piece by Joan Didion...

575
00:39:39,335 --> 00:39:42,379
...even an interview with
Christiane Amanpour.

576
00:39:42,588 --> 00:39:44,298
Someone's been
drinking the Kool-Aid.

577
00:39:44,507 --> 00:39:46,592
What are you...?

578
00:39:47,676 --> 00:39:48,802
- Nate.
- I got it.

579
00:39:48,969 --> 00:39:51,347
- It's... Yep, the dragon lady.
- Let me talk to her.

580
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:55,476
- No. Okay, I need that. Lily, no, no, no!
- Tell her to get her own scrambled eggs.

581
00:39:55,643 --> 00:40:01,232
It's gonna answer it! It's gonna
answer it! Gimme the phone! The phone.

582
00:40:03,275 --> 00:40:05,569
Hi, Miranda.

583
00:40:07,112 --> 00:40:08,489
Absolutely.

584
00:40:10,324 --> 00:40:11,700
I'm leaving right now.

585
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:16,831
You know, you guys didn't
have to be such assholes.

586
00:40:48,696 --> 00:40:52,616
Excuse me.
I'm looking for James Holt.

587
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:56,537
- That's him right there.
- Oh, oh, thanks.

588
00:40:56,745 --> 00:40:58,164
No problem.

589
00:40:58,372 --> 00:41:00,958
I put my stuff out there
and I pray they approve.

590
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:06,005
Excuse me. I'm Andy.
I'm picking up for Miranda Priestly.

591
00:41:06,213 --> 00:41:08,757
Oh, yes. You must be
the new Emily.

592
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:11,302
- Oh, yeah.
- Nice to meet you.

593
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:15,097
Oh, let me see that bag.
Very, very nice.

594
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:19,101
Distressed, studded leather, pieced by
hand, finished with a metallic fringe.

595
00:41:19,268 --> 00:41:21,729
Very nice, indeed.
Who made that fantastic thing?

596
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:24,607
You.

597
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:27,943
Duh. This way.

598
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:34,825
Here we go. It's a sketch
of Miranda's dress for the benefit.

599
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:38,287
Also the centerpiece of my spring
collection. Top-secret stuff.

600
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:40,581
- I'll guard it with my life.
- Please do.

601
00:41:40,789 --> 00:41:45,336
Come on. You're working for Miranda,
you must be in need of hard liquor.

602
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:49,840
Excuse us, girls.

603
00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:52,009
She'll have the punch.

604
00:41:55,721 --> 00:41:58,807
It's deadly. Have fun.

605
00:42:03,062 --> 00:42:05,314
He's right, you know.

606
00:42:06,065 --> 00:42:07,399
The punch.

607
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:10,945
I drank it at his last party. I woke
up in Hoboken wearing nothing...

608
00:42:11,111 --> 00:42:13,531
...but a poncho and a cowboy hat.

609
00:42:13,739 --> 00:42:16,033
Well.

610
00:42:16,242 --> 00:42:18,285
Wise.

611
00:42:18,494 --> 00:42:21,497
- Hi.
- Christian Thompson.

612
00:42:22,748 --> 00:42:25,251
Christian Thompson? You're kidding.

613
00:42:25,459 --> 00:42:28,879
No, you're... You write for, like,
every magazine I love.

614
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:32,466
I reviewed your collection of essays
for my college newspaper.

615
00:42:32,675 --> 00:42:35,511
Did you mention my good looks
and my killer charm?

616
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:37,847
- No, but...
- What do you do?

617
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:44,103
Oh, well... I wanna work for somewhere
like The New Yorker or Vanity Fair.

618
00:42:44,311 --> 00:42:46,564
- I am a writer too.
- Is that right?

619
00:42:46,772 --> 00:42:48,774
I should read your stuff. Send it over.

620
00:42:48,983 --> 00:42:51,026
Yeah?

621
00:42:51,235 --> 00:42:53,404
That would... Thank you.
That would be great.

622
00:42:55,197 --> 00:42:58,492
Actually, right now, I'm working
as Miranda Priestly's assistant.

623
00:42:58,701 --> 00:43:02,872
Oh, you're kidding.
Well, that's too bad. That's... Whoa.

624
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:05,040
You'll never survive Miranda.

625
00:43:06,792 --> 00:43:10,045
- Excuse me?
- Well, you seem nice, smart.

626
00:43:10,462 --> 00:43:12,256
You can't do that job.

627
00:43:14,717 --> 00:43:16,135
Gotta go.

628
00:43:16,343 --> 00:43:21,891
Okay. Well, it was very, very nice
to meet you, Miranda girl.

629
00:43:36,989 --> 00:43:38,616
Emily?

630
00:43:46,832 --> 00:43:50,002
Call James Holt's office. Tell them
I wanna move the preview up.

631
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:54,089
Today at 12:30. Tell everybody else.
Be ready to leave in half an hour.

632
00:43:54,757 --> 00:43:56,842
But we're not expected
until Tuesday.

633
00:43:57,051 --> 00:43:59,386
- Did she say why?
- Yes. She explained...

634
00:43:59,553 --> 00:44:03,224
...every detail of her decision-making.
Then we brushed each other's hair...

635
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:06,393
...and gabbed about American Idol.
- I see your point.

636
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:09,146
- What's a preview, anyway?
- Good morning, Miranda.

637
00:44:09,355 --> 00:44:13,526
Miranda insists on seeing the designer's
collections before they show them.

638
00:44:13,734 --> 00:44:15,361
- Great to see you again.
- Hello.

639
00:44:15,694 --> 00:44:18,447
- And she tells them what she thinks?
- In her way.

640
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:22,034
This season really began for me
with a meditation...

641
00:44:22,243 --> 00:44:24,787
...on the intersection
between East and West.

642
00:44:24,995 --> 00:44:28,374
There's a scale. One nod is good.
Two nods, very good.

643
00:44:28,958 --> 00:44:32,628
There's only been one actual smile on
record, and that was Tom Ford in 2001.

644
00:44:32,837 --> 00:44:34,171
An obi belt.

645
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:36,924
If she doesn 't like it,
she shakes her head.

646
00:44:37,132 --> 00:44:40,761
This is the dress we have designed
specifically and exclusively for you.

647
00:44:40,970 --> 00:44:43,597
Then, of course,
there's the pursing of the lips.

648
00:44:43,806 --> 00:44:45,683
Which means...?

649
00:44:50,145 --> 00:44:51,730
Catastrophe.

650
00:44:52,815 --> 00:44:55,067
Just... Just go.

651
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:58,279
- I know.
- I just don't understand. I'm appalled.

652
00:44:58,487 --> 00:45:01,448
- Appalled. I'll talk to him.
- You deal with it.

653
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:05,411
So because she pursed her lips,
he's gonna change his entire collection?

654
00:45:05,619 --> 00:45:07,413
You still don't get it, do you?

655
00:45:07,621 --> 00:45:10,833
Her opinion is the only one
that matters.

656
00:45:12,835 --> 00:45:15,921
- Call my husband and confirm dinner...
- At Pastis? Done.

657
00:45:16,088 --> 00:45:17,798
And I'll need a change of clothes.

658
00:45:18,007 --> 00:45:21,510
Well, I've already messengered
your outfit over to the shoot.

659
00:45:23,095 --> 00:45:27,641
Fine. And Andrea, I would like you
to deliver the Book to my home tonight.

660
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:30,269
Have Emily give you the key.

661
00:45:32,146 --> 00:45:35,733
- Guard this with your life.
- Of course.

662
00:45:36,609 --> 00:45:40,654
You know, if I can deliver the Book, that
means I must've done something right.

663
00:45:40,863 --> 00:45:42,656
I'm not a psycho.

664
00:45:42,865 --> 00:45:44,617
And, you know she called me Andrea?

665
00:45:44,825 --> 00:45:47,828
I mean, she didn't call me Emily.
Isn't that great?

666
00:45:48,037 --> 00:45:50,122
Yeah, whoopee.

667
00:45:52,833 --> 00:45:56,962
Now, it's very important that you do
exactly what I'm about to tell you.

668
00:45:57,171 --> 00:45:59,006
Oh, okay.

669
00:45:59,215 --> 00:46:02,259
The Book is assembled by 10, 10:30...

670
00:46:02,426 --> 00:46:04,595
...and you must wait around for it
until then.

671
00:46:06,013 --> 00:46:09,433
You will be delivering Miranda's
dry-cleaning with the Book.

672
00:46:11,852 --> 00:46:15,523
Now, the car will take you
straight to Miranda 's townhouse.

673
00:46:15,731 --> 00:46:18,025
You let yourself in.

674
00:46:20,152 --> 00:46:25,783
Andrea. You do not talk to anyone.
You do not look at anyone.

675
00:46:25,991 --> 00:46:31,038
This is of the utmost importance. You
must be invisible. Do you understand?

676
00:46:31,247 --> 00:46:34,458
You open the door
and you walk across the foyer.

677
00:46:34,667 --> 00:46:39,755
You hang the dry-cleaning in the closet
across from the staircase.

678
00:46:46,929 --> 00:46:49,849
And you leave the Book
on the table with the flowers.

679
00:46:57,022 --> 00:46:59,984
- Shit.
- It's that door to the left.

680
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:06,615
Okay.

681
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:14,874
Thank you.

682
00:47:16,375 --> 00:47:17,877
You can give the Book to us.

683
00:47:18,961 --> 00:47:21,589
- Which...? Which table?
- It's okay. Come on up.

684
00:47:21,755 --> 00:47:24,133
- No, I can't. I can't.
- What? It's okay. Come on.

685
00:47:24,341 --> 00:47:27,678
- Yeah, come on. It's okay.
- Please stop talking.

686
00:47:27,887 --> 00:47:31,015
Or you could bring the Book upstairs.
Emily does it all the time.

687
00:47:31,182 --> 00:47:35,436
She does? Right. She does.
All the time.

688
00:47:35,644 --> 00:47:38,606
Yeah? Okay.

689
00:47:45,404 --> 00:47:48,449
What did you expect me to do,
walk out in the middle of a shoot?

690
00:47:48,616 --> 00:47:50,993
I rushed out of an
investment committee meeting.

691
00:47:51,202 --> 00:47:53,746
- And I sat there waiting.
- I told you cell phones...

692
00:47:53,954 --> 00:47:55,456
...didn't work. No signals.

693
00:47:55,623 --> 00:47:57,958
I knew everyone in the restaurant
was thinking:

694
00:47:58,125 --> 00:48:01,128
"There he is, waiting for her again."

695
00:48:25,945 --> 00:48:27,321
Okay, okay.

696
00:48:27,488 --> 00:48:30,157
Okay, okay. It really wasn't
that big a deal. I promise.

697
00:48:30,324 --> 00:48:32,743
The twins said hello,
I said hello back and then...

698
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:34,703
...I went up to give her the Book...

699
00:48:35,204 --> 00:48:37,331
You went upstairs?
You went upstairs. My God.

700
00:48:37,498 --> 00:48:41,001
Why didn't you just climb into bed
with her and ask for a bedtime story?

701
00:48:41,210 --> 00:48:44,088
Okay. Okay.
I made a mistake. I know.

702
00:48:44,296 --> 00:48:45,881
Andrea, you don't understand.

703
00:48:46,090 --> 00:48:49,260
If you get fired, that might
jeopardize Paris. If that happens...

704
00:48:49,426 --> 00:48:52,263
...I'll search every Blimpie's
in the tristate area for you.

705
00:48:52,429 --> 00:48:54,890
Hold on. She's gonna fire me?

706
00:48:55,057 --> 00:48:58,686
I don't know. She's not happy.

707
00:48:58,853 --> 00:49:00,229
Andrea.

708
00:49:10,823 --> 00:49:13,993
- Miranda, about last night, I'm...
- I need the Harry Potter book...

709
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:15,411
...for the twins.

710
00:49:15,995 --> 00:49:18,622
Okay. Okay, I'll go down
to Barnes and Noble right now.

711
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:22,668
Did you fall down and smack
your little head on the pavement?

712
00:49:24,628 --> 00:49:27,631
- Not that I can recall.
- We have all the published books.

713
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:30,467
The twins want to know
what happens next.

714
00:49:31,927 --> 00:49:34,054
You want the unpublished manuscript?

715
00:49:34,221 --> 00:49:37,600
We know everyone in publishing.
It shouldn't be a problem, should it?

716
00:49:37,766 --> 00:49:40,269
And you can do anything, right?

717
00:49:48,194 --> 00:49:49,653
Yes, Bobbsey?

718
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:53,449
I know, baby. Mommy's working
very hard to get it for you.

719
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:57,286
She doesn't get it. You know, I could
call fricking J. K. Rowling herself.

720
00:49:57,453 --> 00:49:59,371
I'm not gonna get a copy
of that book.

721
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:04,251
My girls leave for their grandmother's
at 4 so the book better be here by 3.

722
00:50:04,460 --> 00:50:07,254
- Of course.
- And I would like my steak here...

723
00:50:07,463 --> 00:50:09,006
...in 15 minutes.

724
00:50:09,215 --> 00:50:11,175
No problem.

725
00:50:11,884 --> 00:50:15,846
Okay. I have four hours
to get the impossible manuscript.

726
00:50:16,013 --> 00:50:18,349
Smith and Wollensky's
doesn't open until 11:30.

727
00:50:18,516 --> 00:50:20,142
How am I gonna get the steak?

728
00:50:20,309 --> 00:50:24,230
Okay. I will be back
in 15 minutes. Wish me luck.

729
00:50:24,438 --> 00:50:25,606
No, shan't.

730
00:50:25,815 --> 00:50:29,693
Yes, yes, yes, I've been on hold.
Well, it's for Miranda Priestly.

731
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:31,278
It's very important.

732
00:50:31,445 --> 00:50:35,658
Yes, I know. I know it's impossible
to get, but, well, I was wondering...

733
00:50:35,825 --> 00:50:39,787
...if you could make the impossible
possible, if that's at all possible?

734
00:50:39,995 --> 00:50:43,249
Yes, I'm calling about
the Harry Potter manuscript.

735
00:50:44,083 --> 00:50:46,293
No. Unpublished.

736
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:50,798
Not a chance? Could you tell her
that it's for Miranda Priestly?

737
00:50:51,006 --> 00:50:53,008
Because I think it makes a difference.

738
00:50:58,347 --> 00:51:01,517
Let me call you back.
Hi. You probably don't remember me.

739
00:51:01,684 --> 00:51:04,854
We met at James Holt's party.
I'm Miranda Priestly's assistant.

740
00:51:05,062 --> 00:51:08,983
The Harry Potter manuscript?
Oh, you're kidding.

741
00:51:09,150 --> 00:51:11,402
Sorry to ask, but I am desperate.

742
00:51:11,569 --> 00:51:14,989
Just tell her it can't be done.
You'll have to come up with a plan B.

743
00:51:15,197 --> 00:51:17,324
This is Miranda Priestly
we're talking about.

744
00:51:17,491 --> 00:51:19,827
There is no plan B.
There's only plan A.

745
00:51:20,828 --> 00:51:22,872
Is she back? Am I fired?

746
00:51:23,038 --> 00:51:26,417
You know, I rarely say this
to people who aren't me...

747
00:51:26,584 --> 00:51:31,088
...but you have got to calm down.
Bloody hell.

748
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:38,596
Coat, bag.

749
00:51:40,556 --> 00:51:42,933
What's that? Oh, I don't want that.

750
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:47,855
I'm having lunch with Irv. I'll be back
at 3. I'd like my Starbucks waiting.

751
00:51:49,899 --> 00:51:53,027
And if you don't have
that Harry Potter book by then...

752
00:51:53,235 --> 00:51:55,779
...don't even bother coming back.

753
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:10,377
Hello?

754
00:52:11,212 --> 00:52:13,005
Quit? Are you sure?

755
00:52:13,214 --> 00:52:17,718
I failed. She's gonna fire me anyway.
I might as well beat her to the punch.

756
00:52:17,927 --> 00:52:21,639
Andy, good for you.
Congratulations. You're free.

757
00:52:21,847 --> 00:52:25,518
- Yeah, well, listen, I'll call you later.
- Okay.

758
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:29,480
- Hello?
- I'm brilliant. No, really.

759
00:52:29,939 --> 00:52:32,775
Monuments should be
erected in my honor.

760
00:52:32,942 --> 00:52:34,652
- You didn't.
- Oh, yes.

761
00:52:34,819 --> 00:52:39,490
Friend of a friend does the cover art,
and she happens to have the manuscript.

762
00:52:40,157 --> 00:52:45,621
Oh, no, because that would mean
that I actually did something right.

763
00:52:45,788 --> 00:52:47,790
It's just...

764
00:52:47,957 --> 00:52:50,000
The thing is, Christian, I was just...

765
00:52:50,209 --> 00:52:54,588
Look, you want this thing, you better
hurry. I'll meet you at the St. Regis.

766
00:53:02,513 --> 00:53:04,181
Excuse me.

767
00:53:14,859 --> 00:53:17,111
Welcome to the St. Regis.
May I assist you?

768
00:53:17,278 --> 00:53:19,989
Yes, I'm meeting someone
at the King Cole Bar.

769
00:53:20,156 --> 00:53:22,032
Right this way.

770
00:53:25,411 --> 00:53:28,247
- You have one hour.
- Thank you.

771
00:53:37,923 --> 00:53:42,720
One copy. What are my twins
gonna do with that? Share?

772
00:53:42,928 --> 00:53:45,306
Oh, no, I made two copies.
And had them covered...

773
00:53:45,472 --> 00:53:48,267
...reset and bound so they
wouldn't look like manuscripts.

774
00:53:48,475 --> 00:53:51,937
This is an extra copy to have on file,
you know, just in case.

775
00:53:52,104 --> 00:53:55,232
Well, where are these fabulous copies?
I don't see them anywhere.

776
00:53:57,776 --> 00:54:01,280
They're with the twins. You know,
on the train on the way to Grandma 's.

777
00:54:03,657 --> 00:54:05,242
Is there anything else
I can do for you?

778
00:54:09,538 --> 00:54:11,081
That's all.

779
00:54:11,499 --> 00:54:12,833
Okay.

780
00:54:28,432 --> 00:54:31,477
- Hey.
- Hey, I went to Dean and DeLuca.

781
00:54:31,644 --> 00:54:35,981
Man, they charge, like,
$5 a strawberry there. But I figure...

782
00:54:36,315 --> 00:54:38,359
...since you quit your job...

783
00:54:38,943 --> 00:54:40,486
...we should celebrate.

784
00:54:40,903 --> 00:54:42,279
Listen, Nate...

785
00:54:42,696 --> 00:54:47,493
Wait, you quit your job, but you're still
working on the twins' science project?

786
00:54:49,495 --> 00:54:54,750
- Well, that's big of you.
- Okay, after we talked, I realized...

787
00:54:54,959 --> 00:54:59,922
...it doesn't make sense throwing away
all those months of hard work.

788
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:02,049
I had a moment of weakness,
that's all.

789
00:55:02,216 --> 00:55:05,803
Yeah, well, either that, or your job sucks
and your boss is a wacko.

790
00:55:08,681 --> 00:55:10,599
All right.

791
00:55:11,100 --> 00:55:14,019
Whatever. It's your job.

792
00:55:15,938 --> 00:55:17,565
Nate.

793
00:55:18,232 --> 00:55:20,109
Come on.

794
00:55:20,276 --> 00:55:22,111
I'm still the same person I was.

795
00:55:22,278 --> 00:55:26,115
I still want the same things. Okay?

796
00:55:26,282 --> 00:55:30,161
I promise. Same Andy. Better clothes.

797
00:55:31,579 --> 00:55:33,414
I liked the old clothes.

798
00:55:34,832 --> 00:55:36,500
Really?

799
00:55:37,459 --> 00:55:40,754
Well, what about these necklaces?
Do you like them?

800
00:55:41,380 --> 00:55:45,593
No? And this dress? It's new.

801
00:55:48,596 --> 00:55:51,265
Well, there is one other thing
that's new...

802
00:55:51,432 --> 00:55:54,518
...that I thought you might like, but...

803
00:55:55,811 --> 00:55:57,188
What about this?

804
00:55:59,273 --> 00:56:02,109
You don't like it,
I should better do the twins'...

805
00:56:21,962 --> 00:56:24,882
Is this number two look?
This is number two?

806
00:56:25,508 --> 00:56:29,512
- Hi.
- Hi. All right, turn around for me, darling.

807
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:33,015
Oh, I get it. I get it. The piece
is called "Urban Jungle," right?

808
00:56:33,182 --> 00:56:36,393
Yes. The modern woman
unleashes the animal within...

809
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:38,479
...to take on the big city.

810
00:56:38,646 --> 00:56:40,272
Good. Go.

811
00:56:41,190 --> 00:56:45,319
Sometimes I can't believe I talk about
this crap all day. Bobby, come here.

812
00:56:45,486 --> 00:56:47,446
- Thanks.
- Make sure Miranda gets these...

813
00:56:47,613 --> 00:56:51,408
...as soon as possible. And tell her that I
switched in the Dior for the Rocha.

814
00:56:52,785 --> 00:56:54,829
Great, can't wait.

815
00:56:54,995 --> 00:56:58,207
- Excuse me. Can we adjust the attitude?
- I'm sorry.

816
00:56:58,374 --> 00:57:01,210
Don't make me feed you
to one of the models.

817
00:57:01,752 --> 00:57:05,589
It's a busy day. And my personal life
is hanging by a thread, that's all.

818
00:57:05,756 --> 00:57:10,219
Well, join the club. That happens when
you start doing well at work, darling.

819
00:57:10,386 --> 00:57:12,763
Let me know when your whole life
goes up in smoke.

820
00:57:12,930 --> 00:57:14,807
That means it's time for a promotion.

821
00:57:22,398 --> 00:57:25,401
No. All right, February.
Back of the issue.

822
00:57:25,609 --> 00:57:27,736
Did anybody speak
with Salma's people yet?

823
00:57:27,903 --> 00:57:30,906
Yes. She'd rather do a summer cover,
because she has a movie...

824
00:57:31,115 --> 00:57:35,202
No. Also I'm pulling the Toobin piece
on the Supreme Court women.

825
00:57:36,162 --> 00:57:39,582
Woman. And I need to see a new draft
on that piece about shopping...

826
00:57:39,748 --> 00:57:41,959
...for a plastic surgeon. It's dull.

827
00:57:42,710 --> 00:57:46,505
And this layout for
the "Winter Wonderland" spread...

828
00:57:46,672 --> 00:57:49,049
Not wonderful yet.

829
00:57:49,258 --> 00:57:51,677
- Okay, I'll look at it.
- What about Testino?

830
00:57:51,844 --> 00:57:53,637
- Where are we on that?
- Zac Posen's...

831
00:57:53,846 --> 00:57:56,223
...doing some sculptural suits,
so I suggested...

832
00:57:56,390 --> 00:57:58,809
...that Testino shoot them
at the Noguchi Garden.

833
00:57:59,185 --> 00:58:00,686
Perfect.

834
00:58:00,895 --> 00:58:04,982
Thank God somebody came to work
today. What about accessories for April?

835
00:58:05,149 --> 00:58:09,820
One thought I had was enamel:
Bangles, pendants, earrings...

836
00:58:10,029 --> 00:58:12,031
No, we did that two years ago.
What else?

837
00:58:12,239 --> 00:58:15,451
They're showing a lot of florals
right now, so I was thinking I...

838
00:58:15,659 --> 00:58:19,955
Florals? For spring? Groundbreaking.

839
00:58:20,164 --> 00:58:23,751
We thought of shooting them in an
industrial space. The contrast between...

840
00:58:23,918 --> 00:58:27,254
...the feminine florals, and the
rough-hewn background would create...

841
00:58:27,463 --> 00:58:29,965
...this wonderful tension with...
- No.

842
00:58:30,132 --> 00:58:32,927
Which would...

843
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:42,645
Does anybody else have
anything I can possibly use?

844
00:58:43,562 --> 00:58:46,565
Antibacterial wipes, perhaps?

845
00:58:50,986 --> 00:58:55,282
- How's the cold doing?
- Like death warmed up, actually.

846
00:58:56,909 --> 00:59:00,454
God. It's the benefit tonight. I've been
looking forward to it for months.

847
00:59:00,621 --> 00:59:04,166
I refuse to be sick. I'm wearing
Valentino, for crying out loud.

848
00:59:05,626 --> 00:59:09,213
Right. Well, everybody will be
leaving soon to get ready...

849
00:59:09,380 --> 00:59:13,342
...so I suggest you go drop Miranda's
Fendi bag off at the showroom...

850
00:59:13,509 --> 00:59:15,219
...then I suppose you can go home.

851
00:59:15,427 --> 00:59:19,139
Yeah? Oh, wow, that is great.

852
00:59:19,306 --> 00:59:22,810
Perfect, actually. I need to get to
Magnolia Bakery before it closes.

853
00:59:22,977 --> 00:59:26,689
It's Nate's birthday tonight. So we're
having a little party for him, and...

854
00:59:26,897 --> 00:59:29,859
Yeah, I'm hearing this:
And I wanna hear this:

855
00:59:31,277 --> 00:59:33,028
Bye.

856
00:59:34,572 --> 00:59:38,117
I love my job,
I love my job, I love my job.

857
00:59:46,417 --> 00:59:48,085
Hello?

858
00:59:51,922 --> 00:59:55,426
Before the benefit tonight,
I need to make sure that you're both...

859
00:59:55,593 --> 00:59:57,636
...fully prepped on the guest list.

860
00:59:58,554 --> 01:00:02,600
But I thought that only the first
assistant went to the benefit.

861
01:00:02,766 --> 01:00:05,478
Only when the first assistant
hasn't decided to become...

862
01:00:05,644 --> 01:00:08,481
...an incubus of viral plague.

863
01:00:09,648 --> 01:00:12,234
You'll come and help Emily.

864
01:00:13,152 --> 01:00:14,487
That's all.

865
01:00:15,196 --> 01:00:17,990
Right. These are all of the guests.

866
01:00:18,157 --> 01:00:21,494
Miranda invites everyone. We have
to make sure that they all think...

867
01:00:21,702 --> 01:00:23,537
...that she knows
exactly who they are.

868
01:00:23,746 --> 01:00:25,789
And I've been studying for weeks.

869
01:00:25,998 --> 01:00:30,753
- I have to learn all these by tonight?
- Now, don't be silly, Andrea. These too.

870
01:00:31,295 --> 01:00:34,006
Better start without me.
I'll get there as soon as I can.

871
01:00:34,173 --> 01:00:37,051
Andy, come on, it's his birth...

872
01:00:37,218 --> 01:00:39,261
Okay, but hurry.

873
01:00:39,470 --> 01:00:42,097
Believe me, I will.
This is the last thing I want to...

874
01:00:42,306 --> 01:00:46,018
I love that. I'll call you
the second I'm leaving, okay?

875
01:00:46,519 --> 01:00:48,604
- Will that fit me?
- Oh, yeah.

876
01:00:48,813 --> 01:00:52,441
A little Crisco and some fishing line,
and we're in business.

877
01:01:18,801 --> 01:01:21,387
Nothing really. This is...
I mean, really, this is...

878
01:01:21,554 --> 01:01:25,182
...the social event
of the season, and...

879
01:01:40,406 --> 01:01:43,784
Oh, my God. Andy, you look so chic.

880
01:01:43,993 --> 01:01:47,538
Thanks, Em. You look so thin.

881
01:01:47,746 --> 01:01:49,081
- Do I?
- Yeah.

882
01:01:49,248 --> 01:01:52,126
It's for Paris. I'm on this new diet.
It's very effective.

883
01:01:52,293 --> 01:01:55,629
I don't eat anything, and then
when I feel like I'm about to faint...

884
01:01:55,796 --> 01:01:58,674
...I eat a cube of cheese.
- Well, it's definitely working.

885
01:01:58,841 --> 01:02:02,178
I know. I'm just one stomach flu
away from my goal weight.

886
01:02:17,985 --> 01:02:22,573
That's John Folger, the new artistic
director of the Chelsea Rep.

887
01:02:22,740 --> 01:02:24,116
- John.
- Hey there.

888
01:02:24,283 --> 01:02:27,036
- Thanks for coming.
- Thanks. It's always nice seeing you.

889
01:02:27,244 --> 01:02:29,288
Stop fidgeting.

890
01:02:29,455 --> 01:02:31,248
I'm sorry. I'm so late.

891
01:02:31,457 --> 01:02:33,375
Just deal with it. You have to be here.

892
01:02:38,923 --> 01:02:40,966
Emily. Come here.

893
01:02:41,133 --> 01:02:43,886
Isn't that Jacqueline Follet
from French Runway?

894
01:02:44,094 --> 01:02:45,846
Oh, my God, Miranda hates her.

895
01:02:46,013 --> 01:02:48,182
She was supposed to arrive
after Miranda left.

896
01:02:48,349 --> 01:02:49,809
- I didn't know.
- Yeah.

897
01:02:50,226 --> 01:02:52,937
Miranda. Fabulous event, as always.

898
01:02:53,103 --> 01:02:54,605
You've brought Jacqueline.

899
01:03:00,110 --> 01:03:04,323
Wonderful. We're so happy that you
were able to come to our little gathering.

900
01:03:04,490 --> 01:03:07,785
Of course.
I plan my whole year around this.

901
01:03:08,536 --> 01:03:12,706
Well, we're so grateful that you do.

902
01:03:14,208 --> 01:03:17,294
- Ciao.
- Have you gotten my note?

903
01:03:17,461 --> 01:03:18,754
Yes, I did.

904
01:03:18,921 --> 01:03:21,173
- We'll discuss it on Wednesday.
- Yes, I agree.

905
01:03:21,340 --> 01:03:23,175
- No business tonight.
- Not tonight.

906
01:03:23,342 --> 01:03:24,844
Enjoy.

907
01:03:25,970 --> 01:03:29,640
- Em?
- Oh, great. Thanks.

908
01:03:33,978 --> 01:03:36,647
Oh... Oh, my God.

909
01:03:36,814 --> 01:03:39,150
I can't... I just can't remember
what his name is.

910
01:03:39,316 --> 01:03:42,361
I saw his name this morning on the list.
It's... Oh, I know this.

911
01:03:42,528 --> 01:03:45,281
It's something to do with...
Wait, he was part of the...

912
01:03:45,948 --> 01:03:47,491
Oh, God, I know this. It's...

913
01:03:49,160 --> 01:03:50,786
It's Ambassador Franklin.

914
01:03:50,953 --> 01:03:53,664
And that's the woman
that he left his wife for, Rebecca.

915
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:57,710
Rebecca.

916
01:03:57,877 --> 01:04:00,421
- Ambassador.
- Miranda, you look fabulous.

917
01:04:00,588 --> 01:04:03,299
- You're very kind.
- Thank you.

918
01:04:03,507 --> 01:04:08,220
Welcome back to civilization.
You must be so relieved.

919
01:04:13,517 --> 01:04:15,060
- Look at you.
- Hello.

920
01:04:15,227 --> 01:04:18,063
You're... You're a vision.

921
01:04:18,230 --> 01:04:20,065
Thank God I saved your job.

922
01:04:20,232 --> 01:04:24,904
Okay. You know, I figured out
a few things on my own too.

923
01:04:25,070 --> 01:04:27,490
Turns out, I'm not as nice
as you thought.

924
01:04:27,656 --> 01:04:28,782
I hope not.

925
01:04:30,034 --> 01:04:32,203
Wow, if it weren't
for the stupid boyfriend...

926
01:04:32,369 --> 01:04:35,122
...I'd have to whisk you away
right here and now.

927
01:04:37,166 --> 01:04:39,668
Do you actually
say things like that to people?

928
01:04:39,835 --> 01:04:41,629
Evidently.

929
01:04:41,795 --> 01:04:43,130
Well, I gotta go.

930
01:04:43,297 --> 01:04:46,467
Are you sure? Because my editor
for New York magazine is inside.

931
01:04:46,634 --> 01:04:48,552
You know, I could introduce you two.

932
01:04:49,887 --> 01:04:52,640
You sent over your stuff for me
to look at, I... Remember?

933
01:04:52,807 --> 01:04:54,475
- Yeah.
- All right, I gotta admit...

934
01:04:54,642 --> 01:04:57,937
...I only read a couple because
it was a very large packet you sent.

935
01:04:58,103 --> 01:04:59,980
But what I did read wasn't half bad.

936
01:05:00,147 --> 01:05:02,650
You know, I think...
I think you have a talent, Andy.

937
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:05,611
He should meet you.
Why don't you come in?

938
01:05:05,778 --> 01:05:07,738
Just for one drink.

939
01:05:07,947 --> 01:05:11,033
Okay. Yeah, I guess I could for one...

940
01:05:11,951 --> 01:05:15,287
No, I can't.
I'm sorry, but I have to go.

941
01:05:15,454 --> 01:05:18,916
All right.
Give my best to the boyfriend.

942
01:05:26,006 --> 01:05:28,425
Roy, I'm sorry. Can you go any faster?

943
01:05:28,592 --> 01:05:31,262
I'm sure Nate will understand.

944
01:05:33,848 --> 01:05:35,349
Yeah.

945
01:05:38,769 --> 01:05:40,187
Hey.

946
01:05:55,870 --> 01:05:57,580
Happy birthday.

947
01:06:01,792 --> 01:06:04,420
Nate, I'm so sorry.

948
01:06:04,587 --> 01:06:08,716
I kept trying to leave,
but there was a lot going on...

949
01:06:08,883 --> 01:06:10,885
...and you know
I didn't have a choice.

950
01:06:11,385 --> 01:06:13,262
Don't worry about it.

951
01:06:14,638 --> 01:06:16,015
I'm going to bed.

952
01:06:17,850 --> 01:06:19,393
Can we at least talk about this?

953
01:06:28,527 --> 01:06:30,946
You look really pretty.

954
01:07:12,238 --> 01:07:14,406
Andrea?

955
01:07:26,377 --> 01:07:27,753
Do you have the Book?

956
01:07:34,802 --> 01:07:38,305
Paris is the most important week
of my entire year.

957
01:07:38,514 --> 01:07:41,976
I need the best possible team
with me.

958
01:07:42,977 --> 01:07:45,187
That no longer includes Emily.

959
01:07:47,565 --> 01:07:50,067
Wait, you... You want me to...?

960
01:07:52,069 --> 01:07:56,282
No. Miranda, I... Emily would die.

961
01:07:56,490 --> 01:07:59,201
Her whole life is about Paris.

962
01:07:59,368 --> 01:08:01,495
She hasn't eaten in weeks, I...

963
01:08:01,662 --> 01:08:06,500
I can't do that, Miranda, I can't.

964
01:08:06,667 --> 01:08:10,171
If you don't go, I'll assume
you're not serious about your future.

965
01:08:10,337 --> 01:08:14,675
At Runway or any other publication.

966
01:08:19,930 --> 01:08:22,266
The decision's yours.

967
01:08:23,642 --> 01:08:25,895
- But...
- That's all.

968
01:09:26,622 --> 01:09:29,625
- Hey, Andy.
- Hey.

969
01:09:29,792 --> 01:09:31,669
You coming to bed anytime soon?

970
01:09:31,836 --> 01:09:34,296
Yeah, five minutes, okay?

971
01:10:29,727 --> 01:10:31,937
Andrea, don't forget to tell Emily.

972
01:10:34,398 --> 01:10:36,567
Do it now.

973
01:10:46,619 --> 01:10:48,662
Don't pick up.

974
01:10:48,829 --> 01:10:50,247
Don't pick up. Don't pick up.

975
01:10:50,414 --> 01:10:51,457
- Don't pick...
- Hi.

976
01:10:51,624 --> 01:10:53,375
- Emily.
- Hi, hi. Sorry I'm late.

977
01:10:53,542 --> 01:10:56,086
It's just, Miranda wanted
some scarves from Hermès.

978
01:10:56,253 --> 01:10:58,756
She did tell me yesterday.
I forgot, like an idiot.

979
01:10:58,923 --> 01:11:03,010
- So I freaked out, of course.
- Emily... Emily, I need to talk to you.

980
01:11:03,177 --> 01:11:05,846
I called Martine at home
and she opened the shop early...

981
01:11:06,013 --> 01:11:09,600
I'm sorry. She opened the shop early
for me, so I got them, which is great.

982
01:11:09,809 --> 01:11:12,561
Yeah, okay, Emily,
when you come in...

983
01:11:12,728 --> 01:11:15,147
...there's something
I have to talk to you about.

984
01:11:15,314 --> 01:11:18,400
- I hope it's not another Miranda problem.
- Not exactly.

985
01:11:18,567 --> 01:11:21,529
Well, good, because I've got
so much to deal with before I go.

986
01:11:21,695 --> 01:11:23,322
I swear to God, I mean...

987
01:11:27,493 --> 01:11:28,911
Oh, my God!

988
01:11:29,537 --> 01:11:30,871
Emily?

989
01:11:40,172 --> 01:11:44,176
I don't care if she was gonna fire you
or beat you with a red-hot poker...

990
01:11:44,343 --> 01:11:45,761
...you should have said no.

991
01:11:45,928 --> 01:11:49,598
Emily, I didn't have a choice.
You know how she is.

992
01:11:49,765 --> 01:11:52,726
Please, that is a pathetic excuse.

993
01:11:56,438 --> 01:11:57,982
Thanks.

994
01:11:59,150 --> 01:12:03,946
Do you know what really just gets me
about this whole thing?

995
01:12:04,113 --> 01:12:06,323
Is that, you know,
you're the one who said...

996
01:12:06,490 --> 01:12:08,826
...that you don't really care
about this stuff.

997
01:12:08,993 --> 01:12:12,329
You don't really care about fashion,
you just wanna be a journalist.

998
01:12:12,496 --> 01:12:14,290
Oh, what a pile of bollocks!

999
01:12:14,456 --> 01:12:16,458
I know you're mad,
I don't blame you.

1000
01:12:16,625 --> 01:12:20,671
Face it, Andy, you sold your soul the day
you put on that pair of Jimmy Choos.

1001
01:12:20,838 --> 01:12:25,426
I saw it. And do you know what really
just kills me about this whole thing?

1002
01:12:25,593 --> 01:12:30,389
Is the clothes that you're gonna get,
I mean, you don't deserve them.

1003
01:12:30,556 --> 01:12:33,392
You eat carbs, for chrissake!

1004
01:12:33,726 --> 01:12:35,186
God!

1005
01:12:35,352 --> 01:12:37,521
It's so unfair.

1006
01:12:38,022 --> 01:12:40,232
- Emily...
- Just go.

1007
01:12:46,489 --> 01:12:49,325
- Emily, I...
- I said, go.

1008
01:12:54,830 --> 01:12:56,832
You are going to Paris
for the couture shows?

1009
01:12:56,999 --> 01:12:59,126
That's the coolest fashion event
of the year.

1010
01:12:59,877 --> 01:13:02,421
- Who are you gonna see, Galliano?
- Yeah.

1011
01:13:02,588 --> 01:13:04,173
- And Lagerfeld?
- Yep.

1012
01:13:04,340 --> 01:13:08,093
- And Nicolas Ghesquière.
- Ye... Okay, now you're scaring me.

1013
01:13:08,260 --> 01:13:10,387
- Hey.
- Hey.

1014
01:13:10,554 --> 01:13:14,308
This show is amazing.
I am so proud of you.

1015
01:13:14,475 --> 01:13:15,559
Thank you.

1016
01:13:15,726 --> 01:13:18,437
Start with the photos in the back,
work your way forward.

1017
01:13:18,604 --> 01:13:21,023
The way I designed it.
Brilliant. You will love it.

1018
01:13:21,190 --> 01:13:23,067
- Of course.
- And you...

1019
01:13:23,234 --> 01:13:25,027
...I have somebody
I want you to meet.

1020
01:13:25,194 --> 01:13:26,612
Art and sex. Lead the way.

1021
01:13:26,779 --> 01:13:28,948
- See you later.
- Okay.

1022
01:13:47,716 --> 01:13:49,593
Hey.

1023
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:51,887
Hey, Miranda girl.

1024
01:13:53,472 --> 01:13:55,099
Hi.

1025
01:13:55,266 --> 01:13:56,892
I was just thinking about you.

1026
01:13:57,059 --> 01:13:58,894
Oh, come on.

1027
01:13:59,103 --> 01:14:00,437
- It's true.
- No.

1028
01:14:00,604 --> 01:14:03,065
I'm profiling Gaultier for Interview.

1029
01:14:03,232 --> 01:14:05,401
And making my Paris plans...

1030
01:14:05,568 --> 01:14:10,030
...I found myself wondering
if you were gonna be there.

1031
01:14:10,197 --> 01:14:15,327
Well, actually, I am going.

1032
01:14:15,494 --> 01:14:16,954
Great.

1033
01:14:17,121 --> 01:14:20,332
I'm staying at a fantastic little hotel
in the seventh.

1034
01:14:20,499 --> 01:14:24,211
Right across the street from a falafel
restaurant that will change your life.

1035
01:14:26,172 --> 01:14:29,258
I'm sorry, I'll be too busy working.

1036
01:14:29,425 --> 01:14:32,011
You'll have to find
someone else's life to change.

1037
01:14:33,512 --> 01:14:35,639
Well, that's just it.

1038
01:14:35,806 --> 01:14:38,434
I'm beginning to wonder if I can.

1039
01:14:51,363 --> 01:14:52,656
Lily.

1040
01:14:54,033 --> 01:14:56,035
Lily, he's just a guy
I know from work.

1041
01:14:56,202 --> 01:14:59,246
- Yeah, that looked like work.
- You're making a big deal out of...

1042
01:14:59,413 --> 01:15:02,708
You know, the Andy I know
is madly in love with Nate...

1043
01:15:03,334 --> 01:15:05,044
...is always five minutes early...

1044
01:15:05,211 --> 01:15:07,838
...and thinks, I don't know,
Club Monaco is couture.

1045
01:15:08,464 --> 01:15:11,467
For the last 16 years,
I've known everything about that Andy.

1046
01:15:11,634 --> 01:15:12,968
But this person?

1047
01:15:13,135 --> 01:15:15,429
This glamazon
who skulks around in corners...

1048
01:15:15,596 --> 01:15:17,389
...with some random,
hot fashion guy?

1049
01:15:18,724 --> 01:15:20,893
I don't get her.

1050
01:15:21,769 --> 01:15:24,480
- Lily.
- Have fun in Paris.

1051
01:15:25,856 --> 01:15:27,775
You're going to Paris?

1052
01:15:28,818 --> 01:15:30,736
Yeah, it just happened.

1053
01:15:31,529 --> 01:15:34,323
I thought Paris was a big deal
for Emily or...

1054
01:15:34,824 --> 01:15:37,284
Great. Now you're gonna
give me a hard time too?

1055
01:15:39,245 --> 01:15:40,830
Hey, Andy.

1056
01:15:40,996 --> 01:15:42,623
Andy!

1057
01:15:42,790 --> 01:15:45,835
- Andy, what the hell is wrong with you?
- I didn't have a choice.

1058
01:15:46,001 --> 01:15:48,170
- Miranda asked me. I couldn't say no.
- I know.

1059
01:15:48,337 --> 01:15:50,840
Your answer for everything:
"I didn't have a choice."

1060
01:15:51,006 --> 01:15:54,134
Like this job was forced on you,
like you don't make decisions.

1061
01:15:54,301 --> 01:15:58,097
You're mad because I work late and
I missed your birthday party. I'm sorry.

1062
01:15:58,264 --> 01:16:02,226
- Oh, come on, what am I, 4?
- You... You hate Runway. And Miranda.

1063
01:16:02,393 --> 01:16:05,354
And you think fashion is stupid.
You've made that clear.

1064
01:16:05,521 --> 01:16:08,566
Andy, I make
port-wine reductions all day.

1065
01:16:08,732 --> 01:16:10,651
I'm not exactly in the Peace Corps.

1066
01:16:10,818 --> 01:16:14,029
You know, I wouldn't care
if you were out pole-dancing all night...

1067
01:16:14,196 --> 01:16:16,657
...as long as you did it
with a little integrity.

1068
01:16:16,824 --> 01:16:18,534
You used to say this was just a job.

1069
01:16:18,701 --> 01:16:20,703
You used to make fun
of the Runway girls.

1070
01:16:20,870 --> 01:16:23,038
What happened?
Now you've become one of them.

1071
01:16:24,373 --> 01:16:26,750
- That's absurd.
- Hey, that's okay, that's fine.

1072
01:16:26,917 --> 01:16:28,294
Just own up to it.

1073
01:16:28,460 --> 01:16:32,173
And then we can stop pretending like
we have anything in common anymore.

1074
01:16:32,756 --> 01:16:35,968
- You don't mean that, you...
- No, I do.

1075
01:16:42,933 --> 01:16:47,021
Well, maybe this trip
is coming at a good time.

1076
01:16:47,188 --> 01:16:49,607
Maybe we should take a break.

1077
01:16:57,072 --> 01:16:58,532
Nate?

1078
01:17:08,250 --> 01:17:11,921
I'm sorry. Just one second.

1079
01:17:13,923 --> 01:17:16,050
You know, in case
you were wondering...

1080
01:17:16,217 --> 01:17:18,344
...the person whose calls
you always take...

1081
01:17:18,511 --> 01:17:20,346
...that's the relationship you're in.

1082
01:17:20,513 --> 01:17:23,265
I hope you two
are very happy together.

1083
01:17:31,565 --> 01:17:33,859
Hello, Miranda.

1084
01:18:48,100 --> 01:18:49,226
Miranda.

1085
01:18:52,396 --> 01:18:55,274
How are you? So glad to see you.
Thank you for coming.

1086
01:18:55,483 --> 01:18:57,943
- Do you like the collection?
- Absolutely.

1087
01:18:58,110 --> 01:19:00,863
This is very important.
Very, very important.

1088
01:19:01,405 --> 01:19:02,865
This is my new Emily.

1089
01:19:03,032 --> 01:19:04,241
Hello. How do you do?

1090
01:19:04,408 --> 01:19:05,993
- I'm good.
- Nice to meet you.

1091
01:19:06,160 --> 01:19:07,786
- A pleasure.
- You love the show?

1092
01:19:13,501 --> 01:19:16,462
- Miranda. This way, please.
- This way.

1093
01:19:21,926 --> 01:19:24,929
Miranda. Nigel.
Fashion's great gatekeepers.

1094
01:19:25,095 --> 01:19:30,100
Miranda, what is Runway's position on
French fashion versus American fashion?

1095
01:19:30,976 --> 01:19:34,438
I've been thinking.
You still owe me for Harry Potter.

1096
01:19:34,605 --> 01:19:36,482
- Oh, do I?
- Of course you do.

1097
01:19:36,649 --> 01:19:38,567
Are you working tonight?

1098
01:19:39,944 --> 01:19:43,155
- No, actually, Miranda has a dinner.
- Great, you're free.

1099
01:19:43,322 --> 01:19:46,408
Oh, but there is the problem
of le boyfriend.

1100
01:19:47,576 --> 01:19:50,287
Wait, don't tell me,
the boyfriend non plus?

1101
01:19:52,540 --> 01:19:55,167
Oh, you're so full of it.
You're not desolé at all.

1102
01:19:55,334 --> 01:19:57,837
Not even a little.
What time should I pick you up?

1103
01:19:59,880 --> 01:20:01,131
I'll call you.

1104
01:20:01,674 --> 01:20:03,926
Christian, photo!

1105
01:20:25,239 --> 01:20:27,658
Oh, there you are.

1106
01:20:28,951 --> 01:20:34,206
We need to go over the seating chart.

1107
01:20:34,415 --> 01:20:37,960
- For the luncheon.
- Okay. Yeah, sure.

1108
01:20:38,127 --> 01:20:41,046
I have it right here.

1109
01:20:44,300 --> 01:20:46,635
By all means, move at a glacial pace.

1110
01:20:46,802 --> 01:20:48,679
You know how that thrills me.

1111
01:20:56,187 --> 01:21:00,316
Okay. So...

1112
01:21:01,192 --> 01:21:06,989
...first of all, we need to move
Snoop Dogg to my table.

1113
01:21:07,156 --> 01:21:08,574
But your table's full.

1114
01:21:10,367 --> 01:21:12,077
Stephen isn't coming.

1115
01:21:12,786 --> 01:21:15,080
Oh, Stephen is...

1116
01:21:15,247 --> 01:21:19,168
So I don't need to fetch Stephen
from the airport tomorrow?

1117
01:21:19,835 --> 01:21:23,547
Well, if you speak to him
and he decides to rethink the divorce...

1118
01:21:23,714 --> 01:21:26,175
...then yes, fetch away.

1119
01:21:26,842 --> 01:21:30,930
You're very fetching, so go fetch.

1120
01:21:36,060 --> 01:21:42,358
And then, when we get back to
New York, we need to contact Leslie...

1121
01:21:42,983 --> 01:21:48,322
...and see what she can do
to minimize the press on all this.

1122
01:21:51,784 --> 01:21:54,203
Another divorce.

1123
01:21:54,370 --> 01:21:57,414
Splashed across "Page Six."

1124
01:21:57,623 --> 01:22:00,626
I can just imagine
what they're gonna write about me:

1125
01:22:00,793 --> 01:22:04,713
"The Dragon Lady. Career-obsessed.

1126
01:22:04,880 --> 01:22:08,425
Snow Queen drives away
another Mr. Priestly."

1127
01:22:09,593 --> 01:22:14,807
Rupert Murdoch should cut me a check
for all the papers I sell for him.

1128
01:22:16,767 --> 01:22:18,936
Anyway, I don't...

1129
01:22:19,103 --> 01:22:22,606
I don't really care
what anybody writes about me.

1130
01:22:24,692 --> 01:22:30,030
But my... My girls, I just...
It's just so unfair to the girls.

1131
01:22:30,197 --> 01:22:32,658
And it's just...

1132
01:22:35,411 --> 01:22:37,163
...another disappointment.

1133
01:22:37,329 --> 01:22:41,083
Another letdown.
Another father. Figure.

1134
01:22:42,084 --> 01:22:43,878
Gone.

1135
01:22:45,379 --> 01:22:48,090
Anyway, the point is...

1136
01:22:49,550 --> 01:22:51,427
The point is...

1137
01:22:53,262 --> 01:22:57,433
The point is, we really need to figure out
where to place Donatella...

1138
01:22:57,600 --> 01:23:00,895
...because she's barely
speaking to anyone.

1139
01:23:10,529 --> 01:23:13,157
I'm so sorry, Miranda.

1140
01:23:13,324 --> 01:23:15,784
If you want me
to cancel your evening, I can.

1141
01:23:15,993 --> 01:23:19,121
Don't be ridiculous.
Why would we do that?

1142
01:23:22,791 --> 01:23:24,627
Is there anything else I can do?

1143
01:23:26,212 --> 01:23:28,130
Your job.

1144
01:23:31,175 --> 01:23:33,219
That's all.

1145
01:23:59,286 --> 01:24:01,622
Hi. I need Miranda's itinerary
for tomorrow.

1146
01:24:01,789 --> 01:24:03,374
- Okay. Come in.
- All right.

1147
01:24:08,254 --> 01:24:09,713
Who put that together for you?

1148
01:24:10,923 --> 01:24:14,176
Oh, this isn't...
It's just something I threw on.

1149
01:24:14,343 --> 01:24:17,263
Turn around. Let me see. Turn.

1150
01:24:20,933 --> 01:24:23,769
- It's really just... No, it's... No.
- Yeah? Yeah? Okay, good.

1151
01:24:23,936 --> 01:24:27,314
Gorgeous. Really.
I think that my work here is done.

1152
01:24:29,900 --> 01:24:32,695
We're going to celebrate.
I'm going to get some champagne.

1153
01:24:32,862 --> 01:24:34,488
Okay. What are we toasting?

1154
01:24:34,655 --> 01:24:39,493
We're toasting, my dear,
to the dream job.

1155
01:24:39,660 --> 01:24:42,788
The one that a million girls wanted.

1156
01:24:42,955 --> 01:24:44,874
Which I got months ago.

1157
01:24:46,250 --> 01:24:48,711
I'm not talking about you.

1158
01:24:51,714 --> 01:24:54,175
- James Holt.
- Yeah.

1159
01:24:54,341 --> 01:25:00,556
Massimo Corteleoni is investing
in James' company and talking it global.

1160
01:25:00,723 --> 01:25:04,226
Bags, shoes, fragrances, the works.

1161
01:25:05,186 --> 01:25:08,647
And James needs a partner.

1162
01:25:08,814 --> 01:25:14,570
And that partner would be me.

1163
01:25:16,822 --> 01:25:18,616
- Does Miranda...?
- No, Miranda knows...

1164
01:25:18,782 --> 01:25:21,744
...because she put me up for it.
Oh, God, no. Can you imagine?

1165
01:25:22,161 --> 01:25:24,246
But... But... But you're leaving.

1166
01:25:25,498 --> 01:25:28,792
- I can't imagine Runway without you.
- I know.

1167
01:25:28,959 --> 01:25:32,505
I'm so excited, though!
For the first time in 18 years...

1168
01:25:32,671 --> 01:25:34,673
...I'll call the shots in my own life.

1169
01:25:34,840 --> 01:25:37,218
Oh, my God!

1170
01:25:37,384 --> 01:25:42,348
I'm going to be able to come to Paris
and actually see Paris.

1171
01:25:44,600 --> 01:25:47,561
Well, congratulations.

1172
01:25:47,728 --> 01:25:50,564
Nigel, you deserve it.

1173
01:25:52,525 --> 01:25:55,027
You bet your size-six ass.

1174
01:25:56,111 --> 01:25:59,782
- Four.
- Really?

1175
01:25:59,949 --> 01:26:03,702
- Cheers.
- Cheers to you.

1176
01:26:03,869 --> 01:26:07,164
- To us.
- Let me see that.

1177
01:26:10,876 --> 01:26:12,545
Okay, I just wanna say that, yes...

1178
01:26:12,711 --> 01:26:15,631
...there are things Miranda does
that I don't agree with...

1179
01:26:15,798 --> 01:26:17,800
Come on, you hate her.
Just admit it to me.

1180
01:26:17,967 --> 01:26:20,845
- No.
- She's a notorious sadist.

1181
01:26:21,011 --> 01:26:23,139
And not... Not in a good way.

1182
01:26:23,347 --> 01:26:26,308
Okay, she's tough.
But if Miranda were a man...

1183
01:26:26,475 --> 01:26:30,187
...no one would notice anything about
her except how great she is at her job.

1184
01:26:31,897 --> 01:26:33,983
I'm sorry, I can't... I can't believe this.

1185
01:26:34,150 --> 01:26:36,193
- You're defending her?
- Yeah.

1186
01:26:36,360 --> 01:26:39,738
The wide-eyed girl,
peddling her earnest newspaper stories?

1187
01:26:40,364 --> 01:26:42,992
You, my friend,
are crossing over to the dark side.

1188
01:26:45,161 --> 01:26:46,537
I resent that.

1189
01:26:46,704 --> 01:26:49,790
- You shouldn't. It's sexy.
- Sexy?

1190
01:26:52,751 --> 01:26:55,796
- Really?
- Really.

1191
01:27:00,968 --> 01:27:03,554
So do you...? Do you know
where we're going? Because...

1192
01:27:03,721 --> 01:27:04,763
- Yeah.
...I'm lost.

1193
01:27:04,930 --> 01:27:07,558
Don't worry. I know this city
like the back of my hand.

1194
01:27:07,725 --> 01:27:10,186
It's my favorite place
in the whole world.

1195
01:27:10,352 --> 01:27:12,521
You know, Gertrude Stein once said:

1196
01:27:12,688 --> 01:27:16,984
"America is my country,
and Paris is my hometown."

1197
01:27:18,360 --> 01:27:20,279
It's true.

1198
01:27:20,446 --> 01:27:23,282
What do you do?
Do you just write stuff like that down...

1199
01:27:23,449 --> 01:27:26,911
...and then file it away
to use on us girls?

1200
01:27:27,077 --> 01:27:28,871
I'm Christian Thompson.
That's my way.

1201
01:27:29,038 --> 01:27:30,456
That's your way. Right.

1202
01:27:30,623 --> 01:27:33,292
I work freelance.
I have a lot of free time on my hands.

1203
01:27:35,169 --> 01:27:37,755
You know, I never understood...

1204
01:27:37,922 --> 01:27:40,925
...why everyone
was so crazy about Paris.

1205
01:27:41,091 --> 01:27:47,056
But it is so beautiful.

1206
01:27:50,226 --> 01:27:54,396
I can't. I'm sorry, I can't, I...

1207
01:27:54,605 --> 01:27:58,359
You know, Nate and I just split up
a couple of days ago, and I can't...

1208
01:28:02,363 --> 01:28:05,658
I've had too much wine
and my hearing... Vision...

1209
01:28:05,825 --> 01:28:08,160
Judgment's impaired.

1210
01:28:10,788 --> 01:28:15,000
No, I barely know you.
I'm in a strange city.

1211
01:28:15,960 --> 01:28:19,839
I am out of excuses.

1212
01:28:20,297 --> 01:28:21,674
Thank God.

1213
01:29:10,181 --> 01:29:12,349
Yes.

1214
01:29:27,781 --> 01:29:30,534
Oh, hi. What the hell is this?

1215
01:29:30,701 --> 01:29:33,871
What does it look like? It's a mockup.

1216
01:29:34,371 --> 01:29:36,081
Yeah. Of...?

1217
01:29:36,248 --> 01:29:38,167
Of what American Runway
will look like...

1218
01:29:38,334 --> 01:29:41,337
...when Jacqueline Follet
is the new editor in chief.

1219
01:29:43,047 --> 01:29:44,548
They're replacing Miranda?

1220
01:29:44,715 --> 01:29:48,427
Yeah. And she's bringing me in
to run all the editorial content.

1221
01:29:50,805 --> 01:29:52,807
You're really surprised?

1222
01:29:52,973 --> 01:29:56,852
Jacqueline's a lot younger than Miranda.
She has a fresher take on things.

1223
01:29:57,561 --> 01:30:01,106
Not to mention that American Runway
is one of the most expensive books...

1224
01:30:01,273 --> 01:30:02,608
...in the business.

1225
01:30:02,775 --> 01:30:06,570
Jacqueline does the same thing
for a lot less money.

1226
01:30:06,737 --> 01:30:10,241
And Irv's a businessman, you know.

1227
01:30:10,741 --> 01:30:13,577
Miranda will be devastated.
Her whole life is about Runway.

1228
01:30:13,744 --> 01:30:15,454
- He can't do that to her.
- It's done.

1229
01:30:15,621 --> 01:30:18,207
Irv's gonna tell Miranda
after the party for James.

1230
01:30:18,874 --> 01:30:20,334
And she has no idea?

1231
01:30:20,835 --> 01:30:22,920
She's a big girl. She'll be fine.

1232
01:30:25,923 --> 01:30:27,258
I have to go.

1233
01:30:27,424 --> 01:30:31,262
Andy. Andy, it's done.

1234
01:30:32,555 --> 01:30:33,889
Baby, it's done.

1235
01:30:35,307 --> 01:30:37,560
I'm not your baby.

1236
01:30:49,238 --> 01:30:52,283
- Oh, thank God. You're there.
- Excuse me?

1237
01:30:52,449 --> 01:30:56,036
I need to talk to you right away.
It's about Jacqueline Follet. She's...

1238
01:30:56,996 --> 01:31:00,708
Damn. Shit, shit, shit.

1239
01:31:16,807 --> 01:31:18,142
- Yes?
- Oh, hello.

1240
01:31:18,309 --> 01:31:21,228
Mr. Ravitz, I'm so sorry to bother you,
but I was wondering...

1241
01:31:21,395 --> 01:31:23,647
Have you completely lost your mind?

1242
01:31:23,814 --> 01:31:25,399
I need to talk to you.

1243
01:31:25,566 --> 01:31:31,030
- Do not disturb me again.
- But... It's just... Miranda!

1244
01:31:48,798 --> 01:31:50,132
Miranda?

1245
01:31:50,299 --> 01:31:52,968
Miranda. Wait, I need to talk to you.

1246
01:31:53,135 --> 01:31:56,096
Irv is making Jacqueline Follet
the editor in chief of Runway.

1247
01:31:56,263 --> 01:31:58,265
Christian told me
he's gonna work for her.

1248
01:31:58,432 --> 01:32:01,852
Irv is gonna tell you today. I thought
if I told you, you could fix it.

1249
01:32:02,019 --> 01:32:04,563
- Do I smell freesias?
- What?

1250
01:32:04,730 --> 01:32:07,858
No. I specifically told them...

1251
01:32:08,025 --> 01:32:11,821
If I see freesias anywhere...

1252
01:32:11,987 --> 01:32:14,907
...I will be very disappointed.

1253
01:32:15,491 --> 01:32:19,995
For 72 years, Runway
has been more than a magazine.

1254
01:32:20,162 --> 01:32:23,749
It has been a beacon
of elegance and grace.

1255
01:32:23,916 --> 01:32:29,213
Miranda Priestly is the finest
possible guardian of that beacon.

1256
01:32:29,755 --> 01:32:34,635
Setting a standard
that inspires people across the globe.

1257
01:32:34,802 --> 01:32:38,681
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you Miranda Priestly.

1258
01:32:56,407 --> 01:32:58,993
Thank you, my dear friend.

1259
01:33:03,038 --> 01:33:06,208
Thank you very much
for coming today...

1260
01:33:06,375 --> 01:33:10,754
...to help celebrate
our dear friend, James Holt.

1261
01:33:18,554 --> 01:33:24,727
But before I talk to you about James
and his many accomplishments...

1262
01:33:25,895 --> 01:33:29,899
...I would like first
to share some news with you.

1263
01:33:32,902 --> 01:33:37,740
As many of you know,
recently Massimo Corteleoni...

1264
01:33:37,907 --> 01:33:41,911
...has agreed to finance
the expansion of the James Holt label.

1265
01:33:42,077 --> 01:33:45,956
Transforming the work
of this visionary artist...

1266
01:33:46,123 --> 01:33:50,586
...into a global brand,
which is really an exciting enterprise.

1267
01:33:51,086 --> 01:33:54,048
Runway and James Holt
share many things in common.

1268
01:33:54,215 --> 01:33:58,969
Chief among them,
a commitment to excellence.

1269
01:33:59,136 --> 01:34:02,556
And so it should come as no surprise...

1270
01:34:02,723 --> 01:34:06,018
...that when the time came
for James to choose the new president...

1271
01:34:06,185 --> 01:34:07,853
...of James Holt International...

1272
01:34:08,020 --> 01:34:11,565
...he chose from within
the Runway family.

1273
01:34:12,733 --> 01:34:16,904
And it's my great happiness today
to announce to you all...

1274
01:34:17,071 --> 01:34:21,867
...that that person is my friend...

1275
01:34:22,034 --> 01:34:26,997
...and long-time esteemed colleague,
Jacqueline Follet.

1276
01:34:58,863 --> 01:35:04,577
And now to the main event:
Our celebration of James Holt.

1277
01:35:05,327 --> 01:35:09,039
We at Runway are very proud
to have been among the first to...

1278
01:35:09,206 --> 01:35:12,209
When the time is right
she'll pay me back.

1279
01:35:14,628 --> 01:35:16,964
You sure about that?

1280
01:35:17,131 --> 01:35:18,716
No.

1281
01:35:19,550 --> 01:35:21,844
But I hope for the best.

1282
01:35:22,720 --> 01:35:24,763
I have to.

1283
01:35:44,241 --> 01:35:46,994
You thought I didn't know.

1284
01:35:48,370 --> 01:35:52,041
I've known what was happening
for quite some time.

1285
01:35:53,125 --> 01:35:57,713
It just took me a little while to find
a suitable alternative for Jacqueline.

1286
01:35:58,380 --> 01:36:02,927
And that James Holt job
was just so absurdly overpaid...

1287
01:36:03,093 --> 01:36:06,013
...that of course she jumped at it.

1288
01:36:06,806 --> 01:36:10,267
So I just had to tell Irv
that Jacqueline was unavailable.

1289
01:36:10,976 --> 01:36:14,855
Truth is, there is no one
that can do what I do.

1290
01:36:15,022 --> 01:36:17,316
Including her.

1291
01:36:17,858 --> 01:36:21,153
Any of the other choices
would have found that job impossible...

1292
01:36:21,320 --> 01:36:24,406
...and the magazine
would have suffered.

1293
01:36:25,449 --> 01:36:27,368
Especially because of the list.

1294
01:36:28,911 --> 01:36:33,874
The list of designers, photographers,
editors, writers, models...

1295
01:36:34,041 --> 01:36:36,418
...all of whom were found by me,
nurtured by me...

1296
01:36:36,585 --> 01:36:39,463
...and have promised me
they will follow me...

1297
01:36:39,630 --> 01:36:42,550
...whenever and if ever
I chose to leave Runway.

1298
01:36:45,010 --> 01:36:46,762
So he reconsidered.

1299
01:36:50,558 --> 01:36:56,856
But I was very, very impressed
by how intently you tried to warn me.

1300
01:36:57,022 --> 01:37:02,486
I never thought I would say this,
Andrea, but I really...

1301
01:37:03,988 --> 01:37:06,073
I see a great deal of myself in you.

1302
01:37:09,618 --> 01:37:13,414
You can see beyond what people want,
and what they need...

1303
01:37:13,581 --> 01:37:17,251
...and you can choose for yourself.

1304
01:37:19,879 --> 01:37:22,923
I don't think I'm like that.

1305
01:37:23,591 --> 01:37:25,342
I...

1306
01:37:28,554 --> 01:37:32,016
I couldn't do what you did to Nigel.
I couldn't do something like that.

1307
01:37:35,060 --> 01:37:36,937
You already did.

1308
01:37:41,400 --> 01:37:42,735
To Emily.

1309
01:37:43,486 --> 01:37:45,779
That's not what I...

1310
01:37:46,780 --> 01:37:49,283
No, that was different.
I didn't have a choice.

1311
01:37:49,450 --> 01:37:50,993
Oh, no, you chose.

1312
01:37:51,160 --> 01:37:53,162
You chose to get ahead.

1313
01:37:54,163 --> 01:37:57,374
You want this life,
those choices are necessary.

1314
01:37:57,917 --> 01:38:02,087
But what if this isn't what I want?

1315
01:38:02,671 --> 01:38:05,883
I mean, what if I don't wanna live
the way you live?

1316
01:38:06,050 --> 01:38:09,720
Oh, don't be ridiculous, Andrea.
Everybody wants this.

1317
01:38:11,847 --> 01:38:15,434
Everybody wants to be us.

1318
01:39:41,103 --> 01:39:44,273
I have to be at work in 20 minutes.

1319
01:39:45,107 --> 01:39:46,442
What's up?

1320
01:39:47,985 --> 01:39:50,863
Well, I just...

1321
01:39:51,322 --> 01:39:55,326
I wanted to say
that you were right about everything.

1322
01:39:55,618 --> 01:39:57,411
That...

1323
01:39:57,578 --> 01:40:00,956
...I turned my back on my friends
and my family...

1324
01:40:01,123 --> 01:40:04,168
...and on everything
I believed in and...

1325
01:40:04,335 --> 01:40:07,755
- And for what?
- For shoes.

1326
01:40:07,922 --> 01:40:10,674
And shirts.
And jackets and belts and...

1327
01:40:10,841 --> 01:40:12,760
Nate...

1328
01:40:16,472 --> 01:40:18,140
...I'm sorry.

1329
01:40:26,148 --> 01:40:28,025
I...

1330
01:40:28,526 --> 01:40:30,736
I flew up to Boston
while you were gone.

1331
01:40:31,779 --> 01:40:33,447
Interviewed at the Oak Room.

1332
01:40:34,657 --> 01:40:35,991
And?

1333
01:40:37,326 --> 01:40:40,079
And you're looking at
their new sous-chef.

1334
01:40:40,246 --> 01:40:43,999
- I'm moving up there in a couple weeks.
- Oh, that's great. Congratulations.

1335
01:40:49,380 --> 01:40:52,883
Don't know what I'm gonna do without
late-night grilled cheeses, but...

1336
01:40:53,592 --> 01:40:57,096
I'm pretty sure
they have bread in Boston.

1337
01:40:57,263 --> 01:41:00,266
May even have Jarlsberg.

1338
01:41:02,685 --> 01:41:04,895
We might be able
to figure something out.

1339
01:41:07,189 --> 01:41:08,983
You think?

1340
01:41:09,525 --> 01:41:11,318
Yeah.

1341
01:41:17,616 --> 01:41:21,453
So, what about you?
I mean, what are you gonna do now?

1342
01:41:21,620 --> 01:41:24,915
I actually...
I have a job interview today.

1343
01:41:25,082 --> 01:41:26,792
Oh, yeah?

1344
01:41:27,418 --> 01:41:28,752
That's what you're wearing?

1345
01:41:29,670 --> 01:41:32,715
Shut up. I like this.

1346
01:41:36,969 --> 01:41:38,304
Andy. Greg Hill.

1347
01:41:38,471 --> 01:41:39,889
- Hello.
- Come on.

1348
01:41:40,055 --> 01:41:41,390
These clips are excellent.

1349
01:41:41,557 --> 01:41:44,393
This janitors' union thing,
that's exactly what we do here.

1350
01:41:44,560 --> 01:41:48,272
My only question is: Runway?

1351
01:41:48,439 --> 01:41:52,234
You were there for less than a year.
What the hell kind of a blip is that?

1352
01:41:53,652 --> 01:41:56,030
Learned a lot.

1353
01:41:57,448 --> 01:42:01,869
In the end, though,
I kind of screwed it up.

1354
01:42:02,036 --> 01:42:06,040
I called over there for a reference,
left word with some snooty girl...

1355
01:42:06,207 --> 01:42:09,710
...next thing you know, I got a fax
from Miranda Priestly herself...

1356
01:42:09,877 --> 01:42:12,213
...saying of all the assistants
she's ever had...

1357
01:42:12,379 --> 01:42:14,632
...you were by far
her biggest disappointment.

1358
01:42:15,591 --> 01:42:20,930
And if I don't hire you, I am an idiot.

1359
01:42:22,431 --> 01:42:25,059
You must have done something right.

1360
01:42:57,466 --> 01:42:59,009
Miranda Priestly's office.

1361
01:42:59,176 --> 01:43:00,761
Hey, Emily, it's Andy.

1362
01:43:00,928 --> 01:43:02,263
Don 't hang up.

1363
01:43:02,429 --> 01:43:04,348
I have a favor to ask you.

1364
01:43:04,515 --> 01:43:07,184
- You have a favor to ask of me?
- Yeah.

1365
01:43:07,351 --> 01:43:10,396
Thing is,
I have all these clothes from Paris...

1366
01:43:10,563 --> 01:43:13,649
...and I don't have any place
to wear them...

1367
01:43:13,816 --> 01:43:16,861
...so I was wondering
if you could take them off my hands.

1368
01:43:20,990 --> 01:43:22,324
Well, I don't know.

1369
01:43:22,491 --> 01:43:26,704
It's a huge imposition,
and I'll have to get them taken in.

1370
01:43:26,871 --> 01:43:29,540
I mean, they'll drown me.

1371
01:43:29,707 --> 01:43:34,086
But I suppose I could help you out.
I'll have Roy pick them up this afternoon.

1372
01:43:34,253 --> 01:43:36,714
Thanks, Em, I appreciate it.

1373
01:43:37,423 --> 01:43:38,757
Good luck.

1374
01:43:48,851 --> 01:43:51,604
You have some very large shoes to fill.

1375
01:43:52,938 --> 01:43:55,107
Hope you know that.

1376
01:44:00,821 --> 01:44:03,991
I don't understand
why it's so challenging...

1377
01:44:04,158 --> 01:44:08,662
...to get my car when I ask for it.

1378
01:44:53,541 --> 01:44:55,584
Go.

1379
