00:00:03,737 --> 00:00:06,873
[man speaks Sardaukar]

2
00:00:11,378 --> 00:00:13,646
[slow dramatic music playing]

3
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:44,911
[rhythmic thumping music
playing]

4
00:00:55,255 --> 00:00:57,557
[girl in English]  My planet
Arrakis is so beautiful

5
00:00:57,624 --> 00:00:59,192
when the sun is low.

6
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:05,098
Rolling over the sands...

7
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:08,101
you can see spice in the air.

8
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:15,375
[inhuman growl]

9
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:24,417
At nightfall,
the spice harvesters land.

10
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:28,054
The outsiders
race against time

11
00:01:28,121 --> 00:01:30,457
to avoid the heat of the day.

12
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,296
[thumping music tempo
increasing]

13
00:01:39,332 --> 00:01:43,236
They ravage our lands
in front of our eyes.

14
00:01:43,303 --> 00:01:47,240
Their cruelty to my people
is all I've known.

15
00:01:47,307 --> 00:01:49,309
[dramatic music playing]

16
00:01:51,911 --> 00:01:54,347
These outsiders,
the Harkonnens,

17
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:56,449
came long before I was born.

18
00:01:56,516 --> 00:01:58,451
By controlling
spice production,

19
00:01:58,518 --> 00:02:00,353
they became obscenely rich.

20
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:03,156
Richer than
the Emperor himself.

21
00:02:04,324 --> 00:02:05,458
[exhales sharply]

22
00:02:20,607 --> 00:02:22,342
-[stabs]
-[man screaming]

23
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,678
[gunshot]

24
00:02:30,717 --> 00:02:32,285
[explosions]

25
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:38,024
[screaming]

26
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:48,334
Our warriors couldn't free
Arrakis from the Harkonnens,

27
00:02:48,401 --> 00:02:49,636
but one day,

28
00:02:49,702 --> 00:02:53,039
by Imperial decree,
they were gone.

29
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:02,315
Why did the Emperor
choose this path?

30
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:06,085
And who will
our next oppressors be?

31
00:03:15,595 --> 00:03:17,263
[inhales deeply]

32
00:03:26,606 --> 00:03:28,508
[breathes deeply]

33
00:03:44,023 --> 00:03:45,858
[soft music playing]

34
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:59,105
[Lady Jessica]
It's good you're up early.

35
00:04:00,473 --> 00:04:01,808
Your father wants you
in full dress

36
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:03,610
before the Emperor's Herald
arrives.

37
00:04:04,277 --> 00:04:05,778
Full dress?

38
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:08,381
Military?

39
00:04:08,448 --> 00:04:10,984
-Ceremonial.
-[Paul sighs]

40
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:12,318
Why do we have to go
through all this

41
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:13,920
when it's already
been decided?

42
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:16,389
Ceremony.

43
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,091
Mm.

44
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:19,993
Thank you.

45
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:23,830
If you want it,
make me give it to you.

46
00:04:25,231 --> 00:04:26,132
Use the Voice.

47
00:04:26,232 --> 00:04:28,067
Mom, I just woke up.

48
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,311
Give me the water.

49
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:40,680
The glass can't hear you.
Command me.

50
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:00,800
[wind chimes tinkling]

51
00:05:07,874 --> 00:05:10,143
[distorted voice]
Give me the water.

52
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:18,718
[wind chimes stops tinkling]

53
00:05:22,622 --> 00:05:23,623
Almost.

54
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:25,058
[normal voice] Almost?

55
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:27,560
Bene Gesserit skills
take years to learn, Paul.

56
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,530
-[Paul] Mm-hmm.
-You look tired.

57
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:32,732
More dreams?

58
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:39,405
No.

59
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:44,010
[narrator over speakers]
Extreme temperatures

60
00:05:44,077 --> 00:05:45,745
and treacherous weather events

61
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:49,582
make life outside the cities
of Arrakis truly hostile,

62
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:51,551
with sandstorms
powerful enough

63
00:05:51,651 --> 00:05:53,252
to cut through metal.

64
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:56,055
Only the native tribes
known as the Fremen

65
00:05:56,155 --> 00:05:59,726
have adapted
well enough to survive.

66
00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:04,263
Preferring to inhabit the
remotest regions of Arrakis,

67
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:06,265
the Fremen share
the deep desert

68
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:07,934
with the giant sandworms

69
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:11,437
known to the Fremen
as  Shai-Hulud.

70
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:14,107
Long exposure to spice
has given the tribe

71
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:16,876
their characteristic
blue eyes,

72
00:06:16,943 --> 00:06:18,911
the Eyes of Ibad.

73
00:06:19,011 --> 00:06:22,014
Little else is known
of the Fremen,

74
00:06:22,081 --> 00:06:26,119
except that they are
dangerous and unreliable.

75
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,921
Fremen attacks
make spice harvesting

76
00:06:29,021 --> 00:06:30,890
extremely hazardous.

77
00:06:30,957 --> 00:06:34,627
For the Fremen, spice
is the sacred hallucinogen

78
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:36,062
which preserves life

79
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:38,931
and brings
enormous health benefits.

80
00:06:39,031 --> 00:06:40,633
For the Imperium,

81
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:42,869
spice is used
by the navigators

82
00:06:42,935 --> 00:06:44,637
of the Spacing Guild

83
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:47,607
to find safe paths
between the stars.

84
00:06:47,707 --> 00:06:48,908
Without spice,

85
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:51,978
interstellar travel
is impossible,

86
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:53,546
making it by far

87
00:06:53,613 --> 00:06:56,816
the most valuable substance
in the universe.

88
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,785
[slow dramatic music playing]

89
00:07:26,145 --> 00:07:27,847
[slow dramatic music
continues]

90
00:07:46,265 --> 00:07:47,300
Smile, Gurney.

91
00:07:48,434 --> 00:07:50,470
I am smiling.

92
00:07:51,437 --> 00:07:53,039
How much will it cost them,

93
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:55,641
traveling all this way
for this formality?

94
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:57,043
Three Guild Navigators.

95
00:07:57,143 --> 00:08:00,813
A total of 1.46 million,
62 solaris, round trip.

96
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:19,799
By the grace of
Shaddam IV of House Corrino,

97
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:21,834
ascendant to
the Golden Lion Throne

98
00:08:21,901 --> 00:08:24,737
of Padishah Emperor
of the Known Universe,

99
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:29,075
I stand before you
as Herald of the Change.

100
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:32,078
We are witnessed by members
of the Imperial Court,

101
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:34,680
representatives
of the Spacing Guild

102
00:08:34,747 --> 00:08:38,050
and a sister
of the Bene Gesserit.

103
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,821
The Emperor has spoken.

104
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:46,058
"House Atreides
shall immediately

105
00:08:46,158 --> 00:08:47,894
take control of Arrakis

106
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:51,163
and serve as its steward."

107
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:54,767
Do you accept?

108
00:09:03,943 --> 00:09:06,846
[Leto] We are House Atreides.

109
00:09:06,913 --> 00:09:08,848
There is no call
we do not answer,

110
00:09:08,915 --> 00:09:11,250
there is no faith
that we betray.

111
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:16,355
The Emperor asks us
to bring peace to Arrakis.

112
00:09:16,422 --> 00:09:18,858
House Atreides accepts.

113
00:09:18,925 --> 00:09:23,296
[officers chanting]
Atreides! Atreides! Atreides!

114
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:27,867
Atreides! Atreides! Atreides!

115
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:36,475
Your seal.

116
00:10:12,244 --> 00:10:13,512
So, it's done?

117
00:10:15,147 --> 00:10:16,616
It's done.

118
00:10:43,275 --> 00:10:44,677
[Lanville] How was it?

119
00:10:44,777 --> 00:10:46,178
[Duncan over mask]
Stabilizers are too loose.

120
00:10:46,278 --> 00:10:48,347
-We'll dial it in.
-Thank you, my friend.

121
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:49,515
[Lanville] Got it.

122
00:10:50,182 --> 00:10:51,217
[Paul] Duncan.

123
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:52,385
[Duncan]  My boy.

124
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:53,886
-[Duncan chuckles]
-Hey. Hey.

125
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:55,521
[Duncan]  Paul, my boy.

126
00:10:57,223 --> 00:10:59,692
So, you're going
to Arrakis tomorrow.

127
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:01,227
With the advance team.

128
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:02,795
Yes, I'm going
to Arrakis tomorrow

129
00:11:02,862 --> 00:11:04,130
with the advance team.

130
00:11:05,297 --> 00:11:07,066
I'd like you
to take me with you.

131
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:08,701
You would?

132
00:11:09,902 --> 00:11:11,637
Well, that's too bad.
'Cause no.

133
00:11:12,905 --> 00:11:14,140
[Paul] Duncan.

134
00:11:14,206 --> 00:11:16,475
Are you trying
to get me court-martialed?

135
00:11:17,543 --> 00:11:18,644
What's going on?

136
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:20,146
Can I trust you
with something?

137
00:11:20,212 --> 00:11:21,480
Always. You know that.

138
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:24,684
[sighs]

139
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:29,855
I've been having dreams.

140
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:34,927
About Arrakis and the Fremen.

141
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:36,896
[ethereal music playing]

142
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:44,937
[Duncan] Okay.

143
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:46,238
So?

144
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:48,874
I saw you.

145
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:54,280
With the Fremen.

146
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,115
Ah.

147
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:57,616
So, I do find them.

148
00:11:57,717 --> 00:12:00,052
There you go. That's a good
omen right there, right?

149
00:12:02,621 --> 00:12:03,622
Lanville!

150
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:11,931
I saw you lying dead.

151
00:12:12,865 --> 00:12:14,633
Fallen in battle.

152
00:12:15,935 --> 00:12:18,270
It felt like
if I had been there,

153
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:20,139
you'd be alive.

154
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:26,612
First off, I'm not gonna die.

155
00:12:26,712 --> 00:12:27,880
You're not
taking me seriously.

156
00:12:27,947 --> 00:12:29,982
That's why
you want to come with me.

157
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:31,417
Listen.

158
00:12:31,484 --> 00:12:33,152
Dreams make good stories,

159
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:35,654
but everything important
happens when we're awake.

160
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:37,823
'Cause that's when
we make things happen.

161
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:40,259
Look at you.
Put on some muscle?

162
00:12:40,326 --> 00:12:41,560
I did?

163
00:12:41,627 --> 00:12:42,895
No.

164
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:47,066
Hey.

165
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:49,301
See you on Arrakis, my boy.

166
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:53,072
[sighs]

167
00:12:56,575 --> 00:12:58,110
[animal chirping]

168
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:26,705
Father, I'd like to ask
to join Duncan Idaho

169
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:29,542
on his scout mission
to Arrakis tomorrow.

170
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:31,544
I've studied the Fremen
language, I'd be an asset.

171
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:32,878
Out of the question.

172
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:34,280
You'll travel
in a few weeks to Arrakis,

173
00:13:34,346 --> 00:13:35,481
like the rest of us.

174
00:13:35,548 --> 00:13:36,849
I've been training
my whole life.

175
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:38,184
What is the point

176
00:13:38,284 --> 00:13:39,552
if I'm not allowed
to face some actual risk?

177
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:40,886
You know why, Paul.

178
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:43,055
You're the future
of House Atreides.

179
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:45,558
And Grandfather
fought bulls for sport!

180
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:47,359
Yes.

181
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:49,061
And look where that got him.

182
00:13:53,365 --> 00:13:55,734
I need you by my side.

183
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:58,871
When we get to Arrakis,
we'll face enormous danger.

184
00:13:58,971 --> 00:14:00,506
What danger?

185
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:02,474
The Fremen? The desert?

186
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:04,510
Political danger.

187
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:09,648
The Great Houses
look to us for leadership,

188
00:14:09,715 --> 00:14:11,750
and this threatens
the Emperor.

189
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:15,087
By taking Arrakis from the
Harkonnens and making it ours,

190
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:17,256
he sets the stage for a war

191
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:19,491
which would weaken
both houses.

192
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:22,761
But if we hold firm,

193
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:24,930
and tap the true power
of Arrakis,

194
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:27,333
we could be stronger
than ever.

195
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:29,034
What does that mean?

196
00:14:29,101 --> 00:14:30,236
Mining spice,

197
00:14:30,336 --> 00:14:31,837
keeping the Fremen
in their place?

198
00:14:31,904 --> 00:14:33,105
We'd be no better
than Harkonnens.

199
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:34,607
No.

200
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:37,843
By making an alliance
with the Fremen.

201
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:40,613
That's what I've sent
Duncan Idaho to arrange.

202
00:14:42,081 --> 00:14:43,215
Here on Caladan,

203
00:14:43,282 --> 00:14:45,784
we've ruled by air power
and sea power.

204
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:49,722
On Arrakis, we need
to cultivate desert power.

205
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:54,760
I want you sitting in
on my Council.

206
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:56,228
Learn what I do.

207
00:14:56,295 --> 00:14:58,063
What if I'm not, Dad?

208
00:14:59,698 --> 00:15:01,100
Not what?

209
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:05,137
The future of House Atreides.

210
00:15:07,606 --> 00:15:08,974
[Leto sighs]

211
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,952
I told my father
I didn't want this either.

212
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:25,758
I wanted to be a pilot.

213
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:28,394
You never told me that.

214
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,499
Your grandfather said,

215
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:36,335
"A great man
doesn't seek to lead.

216
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:40,072
He's called to it,
and he answers."

217
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:43,642
And if your answer is no...

218
00:15:46,745 --> 00:15:49,949
you'll still be the only thing
I ever needed you to be...

219
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:53,018
my son.

220
00:16:03,162 --> 00:16:07,132
I found my own way to it.
Maybe you'll find yours.

221
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:12,471
In their memory...

222
00:16:15,007 --> 00:16:16,809
give it a try.

223
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:25,517
[grunting]

224
00:16:25,617 --> 00:16:27,820
[Gurney] Don't stand
with your back to the door.

225
00:16:29,021 --> 00:16:30,556
How many times
do we have to tell you?

226
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,057
[Paul grunts]
I could tell it was you

227
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:33,892
by your footsteps,
Gurney Halleck.

228
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:36,729
[Gurney] Someone
might imitate my stride.

229
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:38,063
[Paul] I know the difference.

230
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:39,732
Are you the new
Weapons Master?

231
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:43,569
With Duncan Idaho gone,
I must make do as best I can.

232
00:16:44,703 --> 00:16:46,071
Choose your blade.

233
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:47,906
I've had quite a day, Gurney.

234
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,042
Give us a song instead.

235
00:16:54,646 --> 00:16:55,714
[smacks lips] That's rude.

236
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,317
[Paul grunts]

237
00:17:00,719 --> 00:17:02,354
[powers up]

238
00:17:05,491 --> 00:17:06,759
[device beeps]

239
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:11,597
[Paul groans]

240
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:13,165
[panting]

241
00:17:13,232 --> 00:17:14,767
[Gurney] Come on.

242
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:15,868
Come on.

243
00:17:15,934 --> 00:17:17,169
Old man.

244
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:18,404
[exhales forcefully]

245
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:25,544
[Paul grunts]

246
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,747
[device beeps]

247
00:17:28,847 --> 00:17:31,383
Ah, the slow blade
penetrates the shield.

248
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:37,189
[groans]

249
00:17:38,457 --> 00:17:40,292
I guess I'm not
in the mood today.

250
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:41,593
-Mood?
-Yeah.

251
00:17:41,693 --> 00:17:42,795
What's mood to do with it?

252
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:44,630
You fight
when the necessity arises,

253
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:45,731
no matter the mood.

254
00:17:45,798 --> 00:17:46,899
Now fight!

255
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:50,402
[both grunting]

256
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:53,405
Come on!

257
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:07,453
-[device beeps]
-I have you.

258
00:18:07,553 --> 00:18:09,254
Aye.

259
00:18:09,321 --> 00:18:10,989
But look down, my lord.

260
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,659
You'd have joined me in death.

261
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,627
I see you found the mood.

262
00:18:16,895 --> 00:18:18,263
[Gurney panting]

263
00:18:22,668 --> 00:18:25,637
[devices deactivate]

264
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,441
Will it be that bad?

265
00:18:29,508 --> 00:18:32,010
You don't get it, do you?

266
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:33,345
You don't really understand

267
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:36,115
the grave nature
of what's happening to us.

268
00:18:38,517 --> 00:18:40,018
For 80 years,

269
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:42,254
Arrakis belonged
to House Harkonnen.

270
00:18:42,321 --> 00:18:44,823
80 years of owning
the spice fields.

271
00:18:44,923 --> 00:18:47,025
Can you imagine the wealth?

272
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:49,027
Your eyes.
I need to see it in your eyes.

273
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:51,630
You never met
Harkonnens before, I have.

274
00:18:51,697 --> 00:18:54,766
They're not human,
they're brutal!

275
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:56,768
You have to be ready.

276
00:19:06,845 --> 00:19:08,981
[dramatic ominous music
playing]

277
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:39,878
[Rabban] Lord Baron.

278
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:44,082
[Vladimir] Rabban.

279
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:46,852
The last of our ships
have left Arrakis.

280
00:19:47,719 --> 00:19:49,221
It's done.

281
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:50,822
[Vladimir] Very good.

282
00:19:53,825 --> 00:19:55,894
Uncle, how can we
let this happen?

283
00:19:55,994 --> 00:19:58,030
How can the Emperor

284
00:19:58,096 --> 00:20:00,666
[shouting]
take everything we've built

285
00:20:00,732 --> 00:20:03,035
and give it to that Duke?

286
00:20:03,101 --> 00:20:04,403
How?

287
00:20:04,503 --> 00:20:07,406
Don't be too sure
it's an act of love.

288
00:20:07,506 --> 00:20:09,541
[breathes heavily]

289
00:20:09,608 --> 00:20:11,276
What does he mean?

290
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:19,718
When is a gift not a gift?

291
00:20:21,453 --> 00:20:25,023
The Atreides' voice is rising,

292
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:28,393
and the Emperor
is a jealous man.

293
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:33,632
A dangerous, jealous man.

294
00:20:34,933 --> 00:20:36,735
[ominous music playing]

295
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:49,982
[voices chanting indistinctly]

296
00:21:01,393 --> 00:21:03,462
[voices continue chanting]

297
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:33,325
[voices fade]

298
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:46,338
Paul.

299
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:49,541
[softly] Paul, wake up.

300
00:21:55,347 --> 00:21:56,381
What's wrong?

301
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:58,784
Get dressed and come with me.

302
00:22:19,204 --> 00:22:20,572
What is this?

303
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:23,575
The Reverend Mother
Gaius Helen Mohiam is here.

304
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:25,811
She was my teacher
at the Bene Gesserit school.

305
00:22:25,877 --> 00:22:29,414
She's now Truthsayer
to the Emperor himself.

306
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:31,383
She would like to meet you.

307
00:22:31,983 --> 00:22:33,585
Why?

308
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:36,021
She wants to know
about your dreams.

309
00:22:37,389 --> 00:22:39,224
How does she know
about my dreams?

310
00:22:41,893 --> 00:22:43,428
And why is Dr. Yueh here?

311
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:45,897
He only needs a moment.

312
00:22:45,997 --> 00:22:47,999
[Dr. Yueh] Hello, young master.

313
00:22:48,066 --> 00:22:50,769
Your mother asked me
to check your vitals.

314
00:22:56,742 --> 00:22:58,076
What's happening?

315
00:23:01,246 --> 00:23:03,348
[whispering in Mandarin]

316
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:22,434
[in English] His heart
is strong as ever, my lady.

317
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:25,637
[in sign language]

318
00:23:36,548 --> 00:23:37,649
Paul...

319
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:43,722
[in sign language]

320
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:11,283
[eerie voices]  Who are you?

321
00:24:15,654 --> 00:24:17,923
Defiance in the eyes.

322
00:24:17,989 --> 00:24:19,658
Like his father.

323
00:24:19,758 --> 00:24:21,326
Leave us.

324
00:24:21,426 --> 00:24:22,427
[whispers]
You must do everything

325
00:24:22,494 --> 00:24:23,862
the Reverend Mother tells you.

326
00:24:27,499 --> 00:24:28,834
You dismiss my mother
in her own house.

327
00:24:28,934 --> 00:24:30,101
[Mohiam in distorted voice]
Come here.

328
00:24:30,769 --> 00:24:31,770
Kneel.

329
00:24:35,874 --> 00:24:37,809
How dare you use
the Voice on me?

330
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:46,451
[in normal voice] Put
your right hand in the box.

331
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:51,022
Your mother bade you obey me.

332
00:24:51,122 --> 00:24:52,858
[Paul breathes heavily]

333
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:01,566
I hold at your neck
the Gom Jabbar.

334
00:25:02,634 --> 00:25:04,302
A poison needle.

335
00:25:04,369 --> 00:25:05,670
Instant death.

336
00:25:06,705 --> 00:25:08,240
The test is simple.

337
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,876
Remove your hand from the box

338
00:25:10,976 --> 00:25:12,544
and you die.

339
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:15,247
What's in the box?

340
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:17,582
Pain.

341
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:22,387
-[scoffs]
-No need to call the guards.

342
00:25:22,487 --> 00:25:24,089
Your mother stands
behind that door.

343
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:25,891
No one would get past her.

344
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:34,366
[Paul]
Why are you doing this?

345
00:25:36,101 --> 00:25:37,435
An animal caught in a trap

346
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:40,338
will gnaw off
its own leg to escape.

347
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,340
What will you do?

348
00:25:47,913 --> 00:25:49,614
[high-pitched whirring]

349
00:25:54,853 --> 00:25:56,021
[groans]

350
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:01,059
[exhales sharply]

351
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:06,765
[sobbing softly]

352
00:26:07,933 --> 00:26:09,267
[shudders]

353
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:16,374
-[grunts in pain]
-Silence.

354
00:26:16,441 --> 00:26:18,143
[Paul breathing raggedly]

355
00:26:23,315 --> 00:26:25,116
-[Paul grunts in pain]
-[shuddering]

356
00:26:25,216 --> 00:26:27,052
I must not fear.

357
00:26:28,787 --> 00:26:30,388
I must not fear.

358
00:26:31,656 --> 00:26:34,059
[stifles grunt, whimpers]

359
00:26:34,125 --> 00:26:36,728
[suppressed groan]

360
00:26:36,795 --> 00:26:38,663
Fear is the mind-killer.

361
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:42,000
Fear

362
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,469
is the little death
that brings obliteration.

363
00:26:44,569 --> 00:26:47,172
-[whirring intensifies]
-[Paul grunts]

364
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:49,007
And I'll face my fear
and I'll permit it

365
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:50,241
to pass over me
and through me.

366
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:59,517
[ominous music playing]

367
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:03,188
[dramatic lamentation music
playing]

368
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:05,523
[searing]

369
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:06,958
And when it has gone past...

370
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:18,503
I will turn the inner eye
and see its path. [gasps]

371
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:24,275
[sobs] And where the fear
has gone,

372
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:26,144
there will be nothing.

373
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:32,651
Only I will remain.

374
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:38,189
Enough.

375
00:27:38,289 --> 00:27:40,492
-[panting]
-[whirring fading]

376
00:27:54,806 --> 00:27:57,409
Like sifting sand
through a screen,

377
00:27:57,509 --> 00:28:00,078
we sift people.

378
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:03,048
If you had been unable
to control your impulses,

379
00:28:03,148 --> 00:28:04,716
like an animal,

380
00:28:04,816 --> 00:28:07,018
we could not let you live.

381
00:28:07,085 --> 00:28:09,754
You inherit too much power.

382
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:10,989
What, because
I'm a duke's son?

383
00:28:11,056 --> 00:28:13,858
Because you are Jessica's son.

384
00:28:13,925 --> 00:28:16,561
You have more
than one birthright, boy.

385
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:19,230
Jessica?

386
00:28:26,271 --> 00:28:28,606
You've been training him
in the Way.

387
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:35,714
Tell me about these dreams.

388
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:37,916
-I had one tonight.
-What did you see?

389
00:28:40,852 --> 00:28:42,220
A girl.

390
00:28:42,287 --> 00:28:43,955
On Arrakis.

391
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:45,423
Have you dreamt of her before?

392
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:50,862
Many times.

393
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:55,600
Do you often dream
things that happen

394
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:56,868
just as you dreamed them?

395
00:29:00,271 --> 00:29:01,573
Not exactly.

396
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:06,811
Goodbye, young human.

397
00:29:07,612 --> 00:29:09,247
I hope you live.

398
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:19,157
[Lady Jessica]
Did you have to go that far?

399
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:20,992
[Mohiam] You chose
to train him in the Way,

400
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:22,994
in defiance of our rule.

401
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:24,629
He wields our power.

402
00:29:24,729 --> 00:29:27,499
He had to be
tested to the limits.

403
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:30,835
So much potential,
wasted in a male.

404
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:32,904
You were told
to bear only daughters.

405
00:29:32,971 --> 00:29:34,339
But you, in your pride,

406
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:36,341
thought you could
produce the  Kwisatz Haderach.

407
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:37,842
Was I wrong?

408
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:40,678
You're lucky he didn't die
in that room.

409
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:43,014
If he is The One,
he has a long way to go.

410
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:46,151
His Sight is barely awakened,
and now he goes into the fire.

411
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:50,088
But our plans
are measured in centuries.

412
00:29:50,155 --> 00:29:51,689
We have other prospects

413
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:54,159
if he fails his promise.

414
00:29:56,761 --> 00:29:59,264
Do you see so little hope?

415
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:00,698
[Mohiam] On Arrakis,
we have done

416
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,433
all we can for you.

417
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,335
A path has been laid.

418
00:30:04,435 --> 00:30:06,671
Let's hope
he doesn't squander it.

419
00:30:13,545 --> 00:30:15,680
[voices murmuring
indistinctly]

420
00:30:48,046 --> 00:30:49,747
[breathes heavily]

421
00:30:53,918 --> 00:30:55,253
[Lady Jessica] Paul.

422
00:30:56,154 --> 00:30:57,722
[Paul] What does it mean?

423
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:00,758
That I could be The One?

424
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:02,193
[Lady Jessica] You heard.

425
00:31:05,563 --> 00:31:06,831
The Bene Gesserit serve

426
00:31:06,898 --> 00:31:09,400
as powerful partners
to the Great Houses,

427
00:31:10,435 --> 00:31:11,703
but there's more to it.

428
00:31:11,769 --> 00:31:14,339
You steer the politics
of the Imperium

429
00:31:14,405 --> 00:31:15,840
from the shadows.

430
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:17,542
I know.

431
00:31:17,609 --> 00:31:20,078
You don't know everything.

432
00:31:20,178 --> 00:31:22,447
For thousands of years,

433
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:25,183
we've been carefully
crossings bloodlines

434
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:27,385
-to bring forth...
-The One?

435
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:30,021
A mind...

436
00:31:31,756 --> 00:31:36,094
powerful enough
to bridge space and time.

437
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:38,730
Past and future.

438
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:43,034
Who can help us
into a better future.

439
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:46,905
We think he's very close now.

440
00:31:48,873 --> 00:31:51,042
Some believe he's here.

441
00:31:55,046 --> 00:31:57,048
All part of a plan.

442
00:32:13,798 --> 00:32:15,934
[slow dramatic music playing]

443
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:53,471
[slow dramatic music
continues]

444
00:34:12,016 --> 00:34:13,518
[spaceship lands]

445
00:34:15,186 --> 00:34:16,187
Shield.

446
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:28,733
[metallic groan]

447
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:32,703
[metallic thudding]

448
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:34,872
[door opens]

449
00:34:58,629 --> 00:35:00,498
"My lungs taste
the air of Time,

450
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:02,600
Blown past falling sand..."

[band playing
patriotic music]

453
00:35:47,278 --> 00:35:48,379
Thufir Hawat.

454
00:35:52,884 --> 00:35:54,352
Young master!

455
00:35:54,452 --> 00:35:56,721
How does it feel
to walk on a new world?

456
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:58,723
Exciting, to say the least.

457
00:35:59,457 --> 00:36:01,292
My lord.

458
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:02,994
How are you, old friend?

459
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:05,396
My advance team
has secured the city.

460
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:08,499
We're still smoothing out
a few rough spots.

461
00:36:10,134 --> 00:36:11,469
My lady.

462
00:36:15,907 --> 00:36:17,875
[woman]  Lisan al-Gaib!

463
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:31,756
[crowd clamoring]

464
00:36:33,658 --> 00:36:36,661
[man]  Lisan al-Gaib!
Lisan al-Gaib!

465
00:36:37,728 --> 00:36:39,730
[woman 2]  Lisan al-Gaib!

Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!

Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!

468
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:48,105
Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!

469
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:51,209
Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!

470
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:54,679
Don't be fooled
by the welcome.

471
00:36:54,745 --> 00:36:56,614
They follow
their old masters' rules.

472
00:36:56,714 --> 00:36:57,848
Mandatory attendance.

473
00:36:57,915 --> 00:37:00,218
That's Harkonnen love
out there.

474
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:03,287
[crowd continues chanting]

475
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:08,292
Atreides!

476
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:11,963
[soldiers chanting]
Atreides! Atreides! Atreides!

477
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:15,800
Atreides! Atreides! Atreides!

478
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,369
Atreides! Atreides!

479
00:37:20,471 --> 00:37:23,241
[Thufir] Let's get you
out of the sun.

480
00:37:23,307 --> 00:37:25,810
The heat can kill
in this place.

481
00:37:35,052 --> 00:37:37,321
[ornithopters powering up]

482
00:37:42,059 --> 00:37:43,794
They were pointing at us.

483
00:37:44,795 --> 00:37:46,130
What are they shouting?

484
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:50,134
Lisan al-Gaib.
"Voice from the Outer World."

485
00:37:50,234 --> 00:37:52,937
It's their name for "messiah."

486
00:37:53,004 --> 00:37:56,307
It means the Bene Gesserit
have been at work here.

487
00:37:56,407 --> 00:37:58,843
Planting superstitions.

488
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:01,746
Preparing the way, Paul.

489
00:38:01,812 --> 00:38:04,148
These people
have waited for centuries

490
00:38:04,248 --> 00:38:05,983
for the  Lisan al-Gaib.

491
00:38:06,684 --> 00:38:07,785
They see you,

492
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:10,521
they see the signs.

493
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:15,593
They see
what they've been told to see.

494
00:38:20,665 --> 00:38:21,699
We're good to go.

495
00:39:05,209 --> 00:39:06,544
[Thufir] Shield Wall.

496
00:39:06,644 --> 00:39:08,512
Protects the city
from the weather

497
00:39:08,579 --> 00:39:10,081
and the worms.

498
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:21,158
[eerie dramatic music playing]

499
00:39:56,927 --> 00:39:59,764
[Gurney] The locals call
the big one the Hand of God.

500
00:40:01,565 --> 00:40:04,135
[Leto] Well, the Hand of God
is wreaking havoc

501
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:05,770
on our comms system.

502
00:40:08,973 --> 00:40:10,441
It's so quiet.

503
00:40:11,475 --> 00:40:13,544
[Gurney] Yeah.

504
00:40:13,611 --> 00:40:15,479
That's what worries me, too.

505
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:23,988
[Leto] There's the spaceport

506
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:26,724
and that plume of dust there
is the spice refinery.

507
00:40:26,791 --> 00:40:28,893
Our two
most vulnerable points.

508
00:40:28,959 --> 00:40:30,261
I want you guarding them.

509
00:40:30,327 --> 00:40:32,963
If we can't refine spice
and ship it off-world,

510
00:40:33,063 --> 00:40:35,099
-we're dead here.
-[Lanville] My lord.

511
00:40:35,166 --> 00:40:37,802
The sun's getting too high.
We need to seal the doors.

512
00:40:40,805 --> 00:40:42,006
[Leto sighs]

513
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:44,675
What do they say
about this hellhole again?

514
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:47,244
"To shower, you scrub your ass
with sand," my lord.

515
00:40:47,311 --> 00:40:48,846
That's what they say.

516
00:40:48,946 --> 00:40:50,581
That's what they say.

517
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:57,822
[Thufir] Candidates
for a housekeeper, my lady.

518
00:41:13,604 --> 00:41:15,105
What is your name?

519
00:41:15,172 --> 00:41:17,341
Shadout Mapes, my lady.

520
00:41:19,109 --> 00:41:21,178
[Lady Jessica]
The rest of you may go.

521
00:41:21,278 --> 00:41:22,379
Thank you.

522
00:41:24,682 --> 00:41:26,650
Shadout.

523
00:41:26,717 --> 00:41:28,519
It's an old Chakobsa word.

524
00:41:29,286 --> 00:41:30,721
"Well-dipper."

525
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:33,624
[speaking Chakobsa]

526
00:41:33,691 --> 00:41:34,892
[in English]
You know the ancient tongues?

527
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:36,460
I know many things.

528
00:41:36,527 --> 00:41:39,697
I know that you have a weapon
concealed in your bodice.

529
00:41:40,664 --> 00:41:41,832
[in sign language]

530
00:41:41,899 --> 00:41:43,467
[speaking]
If you mean to harm me,

531
00:41:43,534 --> 00:41:46,036
I must warn you,
whatever you're hiding,

532
00:41:46,871 --> 00:41:48,639
it won't be enough.

533
00:41:50,374 --> 00:41:52,877
The weapon is meant as a gift

534
00:41:53,811 --> 00:41:56,013
if you are truly The One.

535
00:42:11,829 --> 00:42:13,430
Do you know this?

536
00:42:14,765 --> 00:42:16,400
It's a crysknife.

537
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:21,605
Do you know its meaning?

538
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:24,375
[in sign language]

539
00:42:25,843 --> 00:42:27,444
It's a maker...

540
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:29,346
[wailing]

541
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:35,019
A maker of the deep desert.

542
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:39,957
When you have lived
with prophecy for so long,

543
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:42,626
the moment of revelation
is a shock.

544
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:44,395
Lisan al-Gaib.

545
00:42:44,461 --> 00:42:46,597
The mother and the son.

546
00:42:52,536 --> 00:42:54,271
It is yours.

547
00:42:55,873 --> 00:42:59,476
Tooth of  Shai-Hulud.

548
00:43:01,545 --> 00:43:03,881
[ancient meditation music
playing]

549
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:32,409
[men chanting in distance]
Lisan! Lisan al-Gaib!

550
00:43:32,476 --> 00:43:36,614
Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!

551
00:43:46,957 --> 00:43:48,158
[Paul] Hello.

552
00:43:50,527 --> 00:43:53,263
You shouldn't be out here
at this hour of the day.

553
00:43:55,432 --> 00:43:57,668
They're out here.

554
00:43:57,768 --> 00:44:00,371
[gardener] Hmm.
Fremen pilgrims.

555
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:02,439
They don't care
about heatstroke.

556
00:44:04,141 --> 00:44:07,378
I didn't know date palms
could even be found out here.

557
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:10,614
[gardener] Oh,
these aren't indigenous.

558
00:44:10,681 --> 00:44:13,150
They can't survive without me.

559
00:44:13,217 --> 00:44:14,451
Each one of these

560
00:44:14,518 --> 00:44:17,121
drinks every day
the equivalent of five men.

561
00:44:19,223 --> 00:44:20,891
Twenty palm trees.

562
00:44:22,192 --> 00:44:24,728
A hundred lives.

563
00:44:24,828 --> 00:44:26,864
Should we remove them?
Save the water?

564
00:44:26,964 --> 00:44:28,365
No, no, no.

565
00:44:28,465 --> 00:44:30,034
These are sacred.

566
00:44:34,405 --> 00:44:35,873
Old dream.

567
00:44:43,747 --> 00:44:45,916
[narrator over speakers]
The largest and most dangerous

568
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:48,986
organism on Arrakis
is the sandworm,

569
00:44:49,053 --> 00:44:53,190
capable of reaching
400 meters in length.

570
00:44:53,257 --> 00:44:55,659
To avoid making
rhythmic noises,

571
00:44:55,726 --> 00:44:57,227
which attract the sandworms,

572
00:44:57,327 --> 00:45:01,265
the Fremen cross desert spaces
using the sandwalk,

573
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:04,368
a dance-like motion
with irregular rhythm

574
00:45:04,435 --> 00:45:08,439
which emulates the natural
sounds of the desert.

575
00:45:08,539 --> 00:45:11,175
What scant plant life
exists on Arrakis

576
00:45:11,241 --> 00:45:12,843
is thanks to the Fremen,

577
00:45:12,910 --> 00:45:15,846
who have cultivated
deep-rooted terranic plants

578
00:45:15,913 --> 00:45:18,949
such as saguaro, burrobush,

579
00:45:19,049 --> 00:45:23,120
sand-verbena and incense bush.

580
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:26,457
The shepherd's tree has
the deepest documented roots,

581
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:31,061
stretching more than
450 feet deep.

582
00:45:31,128 --> 00:45:33,030
These plants cling to life

583
00:45:33,097 --> 00:45:36,400
in a parched,
nutrient-poor landscape.

584
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:52,116
[slow suspenseful music
playing]

585
00:46:32,456 --> 00:46:34,525
[music building up]

586
00:46:41,031 --> 00:46:42,432
[both gasp]

587
00:46:46,537 --> 00:46:48,272
[Paul] It's a hunter-seeker.

588
00:46:48,338 --> 00:46:50,374
The operator must be nearby.

589
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:52,676
[dramatic music playing]

590
00:46:55,445 --> 00:46:56,880
[Thufir]  The Harkonnen agent
was cemented

591
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:58,849
into that hole six weeks ago.

592
00:46:58,949 --> 00:47:00,651
Ran the hunter-seeker
through a water pipe

593
00:47:00,717 --> 00:47:01,819
inside the walls.

594
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:06,190
Sire, I failed you today.
There's no excuse.

595
00:47:06,290 --> 00:47:07,691
You have my resignation.

596
00:47:07,791 --> 00:47:09,059
You would deprive us
of your talents at this time?

597
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:10,360
Sire, my honor demands...

598
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:12,162
They tried to take
the life of my son!

599
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:14,798
I don't give a damn
about your honor.

600
00:47:14,865 --> 00:47:17,467
You want absolution?
Go catch some spies.

601
00:47:17,534 --> 00:47:18,735
Your Grace.

602
00:47:26,043 --> 00:47:28,312
[Mohiam] The thing must leave.

603
00:47:28,378 --> 00:47:30,881
[man] You can speak
without fear.

604
00:47:30,981 --> 00:47:33,250
Our pet doesn't understand
your language.

605
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:34,818
[Mohiam in distorted voice]
Get out.

606
00:47:39,189 --> 00:47:40,991
[normal voice] It understands.

607
00:47:41,058 --> 00:47:42,593
Activate silence.

608
00:47:47,264 --> 00:47:48,832
[low, muffled speech]

609
00:47:58,008 --> 00:48:00,510
[Mohiam] It must
never be known.

610
00:48:00,577 --> 00:48:03,513
[Vladimir] There's
no satellites over Arrakis.

611
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:07,217
The Atreides
will die in the dark.

612
00:48:07,284 --> 00:48:08,952
[Mohiam] On that matter,

613
00:48:09,052 --> 00:48:12,222
Duke Leto Atreides
means nothing to our order.

614
00:48:12,289 --> 00:48:14,258
But his wife
is under our protection

615
00:48:14,358 --> 00:48:16,960
and by extension, her son.

616
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:19,563
Allow them
the dignity of exile.

617
00:48:21,565 --> 00:48:23,634
[sighs]

618
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:25,636
House Harkonnen
would never dream

619
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:28,705
of violating
the sanctity of your order.

620
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:31,408
I give you my word.

621
00:48:31,475 --> 00:48:33,143
We will not harm them.

622
00:48:53,397 --> 00:48:54,932
If the Duke's son lives...

623
00:48:54,998 --> 00:48:57,501
No Atreides will live.

624
00:48:57,601 --> 00:49:00,003
My lord, you gave your word
to the witch.

625
00:49:00,103 --> 00:49:01,171
She sees too much.

626
00:49:01,271 --> 00:49:03,006
I said I would not harm them.

627
00:49:03,106 --> 00:49:04,341
And I shall not.

628
00:49:04,441 --> 00:49:06,743
But Arrakis is Arrakis.

629
00:49:07,945 --> 00:49:10,514
And the desert takes the weak.

630
00:49:12,616 --> 00:49:13,850
My desert.

631
00:49:13,951 --> 00:49:16,019
[sinister music playing]

632
00:49:16,687 --> 00:49:18,655
My Arrakis.

633
00:49:20,590 --> 00:49:22,259
My Dune.

634
00:49:25,462 --> 00:49:27,798
[Gurney] Your first
strategy meeting.

635
00:49:27,864 --> 00:49:29,099
Paul Atreides,

636
00:49:29,166 --> 00:49:31,101
who catches hunter-seekers
in his bare hands

637
00:49:31,168 --> 00:49:32,302
like a hero of old.

638
00:49:32,369 --> 00:49:34,638
[laughter]

639
00:49:34,705 --> 00:49:36,873
[whispers] Thanks
for the humiliation, old man.

640
00:49:36,974 --> 00:49:38,275
Gotta keep an eye on you.

641
00:49:39,142 --> 00:49:40,444
Attention!

642
00:49:48,452 --> 00:49:49,820
Let's get started.

643
00:49:52,222 --> 00:49:54,057
Thufir. Operations.

644
00:49:54,157 --> 00:49:56,827
I secured a copy of
the Harkonnens' account books.

645
00:49:57,661 --> 00:49:59,196
[men murmuring]

646
00:49:59,296 --> 00:50:00,564
The Harkonnens were taking

647
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:04,134
10 billion solaris
out of here every year.

648
00:50:04,201 --> 00:50:06,870
"They shall suck of
the abundance of the seas,

649
00:50:06,970 --> 00:50:08,472
and the treasure
hid in the sand."

650
00:50:08,538 --> 00:50:10,907
[Thufir] We won't see profits
like that for a while.

651
00:50:11,008 --> 00:50:13,176
Not with the equipment
they left us.

652
00:50:14,144 --> 00:50:15,746
How bad is it?

653
00:50:21,485 --> 00:50:23,487
[Thufir] These are spice silos.

654
00:50:24,855 --> 00:50:27,924
We're meant
to fill every crate.

655
00:50:28,025 --> 00:50:29,926
[Paul] All of them?

656
00:50:30,027 --> 00:50:32,863
Every 25 standard days.

657
00:50:32,929 --> 00:50:35,265
Harkonnen sabotage
slows us down.

658
00:50:35,365 --> 00:50:37,067
[Paul] But who's
meant to arbitrate?

659
00:50:37,167 --> 00:50:38,368
Isn't there
a Judge of the Change

660
00:50:38,435 --> 00:50:39,736
to oversee the transition?

661
00:50:39,836 --> 00:50:41,238
Who did the Emperor appoint?

662
00:50:41,338 --> 00:50:44,107
Dr. Liet Kynes.
Imperial Ecologist.

663
00:50:44,207 --> 00:50:45,709
Been here 20 years.

664
00:50:45,776 --> 00:50:47,611
Eccentric, from what I'm told.

665
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:50,747
I want to see these
harvesting fields myself.

666
00:50:50,847 --> 00:50:52,215
I wouldn't recommend it,
my lord.

667
00:50:52,282 --> 00:50:54,751
Have this Judge of the Change
accompany us.

668
00:50:54,851 --> 00:50:56,286
A meeting's long overdue.

669
00:50:56,386 --> 00:50:58,588
And we'll get
a bit of Imperial protection.

670
00:50:58,688 --> 00:51:00,190
A hostage. [chuckles]

671
00:51:00,257 --> 00:51:01,558
I love it.

672
00:51:01,625 --> 00:51:02,726
Hmm.

673
00:51:02,793 --> 00:51:05,062
-[engine roaring]
-He's here, my lord.

674
00:51:27,284 --> 00:51:28,919
[Duncan well-wishing
in Chakobsa]

675
00:51:28,985 --> 00:51:30,954
[in English] Take care
of them. They are friends.

676
00:51:31,054 --> 00:51:31,988
[Paul] Duncan!

677
00:51:32,089 --> 00:51:33,457
[Duncan] Ah! My boy!

678
00:51:34,257 --> 00:51:36,726
[both laughing]

679
00:51:39,262 --> 00:51:40,430
I swear you're getting taller.

680
00:51:40,497 --> 00:51:42,165
[Paul] Well,
you smell much worse.

681
00:51:45,902 --> 00:51:47,838
For four weeks,
I lived with the Fremen.

682
00:51:47,938 --> 00:51:49,005
Hidden in the desert,

683
00:51:49,106 --> 00:51:50,807
in a community
called a  sietch.

684
00:51:50,907 --> 00:51:52,175
Stilgar, the leader
of that  sietch,

685
00:51:52,275 --> 00:51:54,077
has come with me
to meet you, sire.

686
00:51:54,144 --> 00:51:56,480
This  sietch,  how is it hidden?

687
00:51:56,580 --> 00:51:57,647
It's underground.

688
00:51:57,747 --> 00:51:59,683
Arrakis is filled
with caverns.

689
00:51:59,783 --> 00:52:01,451
How big was the place?

690
00:52:01,518 --> 00:52:03,987
I'd say 10,000 people.

691
00:52:04,087 --> 00:52:05,622
And there are
hundreds of  sietches.

692
00:52:06,823 --> 00:52:08,258
Millions of Fremen.

693
00:52:09,025 --> 00:52:10,494
You were right.

694
00:52:10,594 --> 00:52:13,930
The Harkonnen estimate was
50,000 on the whole planet.

695
00:52:13,997 --> 00:52:16,199
The Fremen watched me
search for them for days.

696
00:52:16,299 --> 00:52:17,767
I never saw them.

697
00:52:17,834 --> 00:52:20,537
Finally, they sent
a warrior out to kill me.

698
00:52:20,637 --> 00:52:22,205
And I gotta tell you,

699
00:52:22,305 --> 00:52:24,708
I have never come
so close to dying.

700
00:52:24,808 --> 00:52:27,611
There's no finer fighter
in the Imperium.

701
00:52:27,677 --> 00:52:29,279
They fight like demons.

702
00:52:29,346 --> 00:52:31,214
Desert power.

703
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:35,385
Duncan.

704
00:52:35,485 --> 00:52:36,953
-Well done.
-Thank you, my lord.

705
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:38,388
[man] Sire.

706
00:52:38,488 --> 00:52:41,057
Their leader has a knife
he won't surrender, sire.

707
00:52:41,158 --> 00:52:44,227
It's a crysknife.
It's sacred to his people.

708
00:52:44,327 --> 00:52:45,529
Let him pass.

709
00:53:02,179 --> 00:53:03,547
[Gurney] Stop there.

710
00:53:03,647 --> 00:53:05,315
Hey! Hey!

711
00:53:08,885 --> 00:53:09,886
Mm.

712
00:53:10,687 --> 00:53:11,888
[Leto] Stilgar.

713
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:14,024
Welcome.

714
00:53:15,225 --> 00:53:17,594
Sir, I respect
the personal dignity

715
00:53:17,694 --> 00:53:19,496
of any man that respects mine.

716
00:53:21,031 --> 00:53:22,699
[inhales deeply]

717
00:53:22,766 --> 00:53:23,833
[Stilgar] Hmm.

718
00:53:25,235 --> 00:53:26,703
[inhales deeply]

719
00:53:27,370 --> 00:53:28,572
[Duncan] Hold.

720
00:53:29,839 --> 00:53:31,741
[clears throat]
Thank you, Stilgar,

721
00:53:31,841 --> 00:53:35,245
for the gift
of your body's moisture.

722
00:53:35,345 --> 00:53:37,681
We accept it in the spirit
in which it was given.

723
00:53:43,353 --> 00:53:44,521
[Leto snorts]

724
00:53:45,689 --> 00:53:46,756
[Leto] I'm glad you've come.

725
00:53:47,724 --> 00:53:49,626
I believe your people and mine

726
00:53:49,726 --> 00:53:51,027
have much
to offer one another.

727
00:53:51,094 --> 00:53:52,462
No, no, you are Outworlders.

728
00:53:52,562 --> 00:53:54,231
You come here for the spice,

729
00:53:54,297 --> 00:53:56,766
you take it,
giving nothing in return.

730
00:53:58,535 --> 00:53:59,569
That's true.

731
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:04,407
I know you've suffered
at the hands of the Harkonnen.

732
00:54:05,575 --> 00:54:07,043
Name what you want.

733
00:54:07,110 --> 00:54:08,311
If it's in my power to grant,

734
00:54:08,411 --> 00:54:09,879
I'll give it
and ask for nothing.

735
00:54:09,946 --> 00:54:12,816
Mm. I ask for this.
Do not seek our  sietches.

736
00:54:12,916 --> 00:54:15,752
Do not trespass in our lands.

737
00:54:15,819 --> 00:54:19,289
The desert was ours
long before you came.

738
00:54:19,389 --> 00:54:21,157
So, come and dig your spice,

739
00:54:21,258 --> 00:54:22,459
but when you have it,

740
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:24,661
go back to this side
of the Shield Wall

741
00:54:24,761 --> 00:54:26,563
and leave the desert
to the Fremen.

742
00:54:26,630 --> 00:54:29,432
You will address the Duke
as "my lord" or "sire."

743
00:54:29,499 --> 00:54:32,102
[Leto] Gurney, just...
Just a moment.

744
00:54:32,168 --> 00:54:33,503
The Emperor

745
00:54:33,603 --> 00:54:36,339
has given me Arrakis
as my fief

746
00:54:36,439 --> 00:54:38,174
to rule and protect.

747
00:54:38,275 --> 00:54:40,777
I cannot promise
not to travel into the desert

748
00:54:40,844 --> 00:54:43,680
if duty compels me.

749
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:46,683
But your  sietches
will be yours forever.

750
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:49,352
And you will never be hunted
while I govern here.

751
00:54:53,857 --> 00:54:55,692
That's very honorable.

752
00:54:55,792 --> 00:54:58,461
I must go. That's all
I have to say to you.

753
00:54:58,528 --> 00:55:00,697
[Paul] Won't you stay?

754
00:55:00,797 --> 00:55:02,165
We would honor you.

755
00:55:02,265 --> 00:55:05,335
Honor requires
that I be elsewhere.

756
00:55:07,304 --> 00:55:08,538
[speaking Chakobsa]

757
00:55:17,013 --> 00:55:18,281
I don't like him.

758
00:55:18,348 --> 00:55:20,617
Our plan bears fruit.

759
00:55:20,684 --> 00:55:22,118
But it will take time?

760
00:55:22,185 --> 00:55:23,453
Yes.

761
00:55:24,387 --> 00:55:26,690
It will take time.

762
00:55:29,459 --> 00:55:30,827
Here, this is for you.

763
00:55:34,898 --> 00:55:36,900
It's a paracompass.

764
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,502
The moons here
have a magnetic field, so...

765
00:55:39,569 --> 00:55:42,205
a simple compass needle
won't point north.

766
00:55:42,305 --> 00:55:44,407
Takes a clever piece
of clockwork to sort it out.

767
00:55:44,507 --> 00:55:46,176
[Paul] The Fremen make these?

768
00:55:46,242 --> 00:55:48,078
And stillsuits,
and sand compactors,

769
00:55:48,178 --> 00:55:49,579
and all kinds
of ingenious things.

770
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:51,648
[Gurney] What the hell
is a sand compactor?

771
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:54,918
[Duncan]
That's a sand compactor.

772
00:55:55,018 --> 00:55:56,086
[all chuckle]

773
00:55:56,186 --> 00:55:58,922
My God, man,
you've gone native.

774
00:55:59,022 --> 00:56:00,323
You admire them.

775
00:56:01,591 --> 00:56:03,093
I do.

776
00:56:03,193 --> 00:56:05,862
They're fierce but loyal.

777
00:56:05,929 --> 00:56:07,731
They're attuned to the desert.

778
00:56:07,831 --> 00:56:09,065
Part of it.

779
00:56:09,165 --> 00:56:11,267
It's part of them.

780
00:56:11,368 --> 00:56:12,535
You wait till you see it.

781
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:14,771
It's beautiful out there.

782
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:20,076
[announcer]
Sunrise warning, all workers.

783
00:56:20,176 --> 00:56:23,113
Temperature today
will reach 140 degrees.

784
00:56:23,213 --> 00:56:24,948
We are currently 90 degrees,

785
00:56:25,048 --> 00:56:28,418
and in 10 minutes,
we will hit 120 degrees.

786
00:56:29,519 --> 00:56:30,787
Last warning call.

787
00:56:30,887 --> 00:56:32,922
[dramatic music playing]

788
00:56:44,868 --> 00:56:46,936
[dramatic music continues]

789
00:57:04,087 --> 00:57:06,256
The Judge of the Change, sire.

790
00:57:06,322 --> 00:57:08,291
Dr. Liet Kynes.

791
00:57:08,391 --> 00:57:09,793
My lord Duke.

792
00:57:10,593 --> 00:57:12,162
Welcome to Arrakis.

793
00:57:12,262 --> 00:57:14,330
[Paul] You're
the Imperial Ecologist.

794
00:57:14,431 --> 00:57:16,332
Thank you for the stillsuits.

795
00:57:16,433 --> 00:57:18,501
They are of Fremen make.

796
00:57:18,601 --> 00:57:19,669
The best.

797
00:57:19,769 --> 00:57:21,070
With your permission, sire,

798
00:57:21,137 --> 00:57:22,505
I must check
the integrity of your suit...

799
00:57:22,605 --> 00:57:23,740
[Leto] Whoa.

800
00:57:24,441 --> 00:57:25,642
It's all right.

801
00:57:27,277 --> 00:57:29,479
It's all right.

802
00:57:29,579 --> 00:57:33,149
[chuckles lightly] Dr. Kynes,
we're in your hands.

803
00:57:37,687 --> 00:57:38,855
A stillsuit

804
00:57:38,955 --> 00:57:42,926
is a high-efficiency
filtration system.

805
00:57:42,992 --> 00:57:44,594
Even this early
in the morning,

806
00:57:44,661 --> 00:57:47,464
you wouldn't survive two hours
without one of these.

807
00:57:48,364 --> 00:57:50,633
It cools the body

808
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:54,537
and recycles
the water lost to sweat.

809
00:57:54,637 --> 00:57:57,941
Your body's movements
provide the power.

810
00:57:58,007 --> 00:57:59,709
Inside the mask,
you'll find a tube

811
00:57:59,809 --> 00:58:01,878
to allow you to drink
the recycled water.

812
00:58:01,978 --> 00:58:03,213
[Leto] Mm.

813
00:58:03,313 --> 00:58:04,647
In good working order,
your suit won't lose

814
00:58:04,714 --> 00:58:07,016
more than a thimbleful
of water a day.

815
00:58:07,116 --> 00:58:08,451
[Leto] Most impressive.

816
00:58:10,153 --> 00:58:11,488
Let's have a look at you, lad.

817
00:58:13,823 --> 00:58:15,225
You've...

818
00:58:15,325 --> 00:58:16,526
worn a stillsuit before?

819
00:58:16,626 --> 00:58:18,228
No, this is my first time.

820
00:58:20,463 --> 00:58:23,066
Your desert boots are fitted
slip-fashion at the ankles.

821
00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:25,001
Who taught you to do that?

822
00:58:25,068 --> 00:58:27,136
It seemed the right way.

823
00:58:30,006 --> 00:58:31,508
[speaking Chakobsa]

824
00:58:34,844 --> 00:58:35,912
[in English] Are you Fremen?

825
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:41,584
I am accepted
in both  sietch  and village.

826
00:58:41,684 --> 00:58:44,354
Now, come and see
the spice sands

827
00:58:44,420 --> 00:58:47,490
on which
your livelihood depends.

828
00:58:52,495 --> 00:58:54,531
[dramatic music playing]

829
00:59:25,428 --> 00:59:26,629
What would you do

830
00:59:26,729 --> 00:59:28,264
if your ornithopter
went down out here?

831
00:59:28,364 --> 00:59:30,466
You wouldn't want
to go down out there.

832
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:32,135
It's worm territory.

833
00:59:34,771 --> 00:59:35,872
Dust cloud.

834
00:59:36,940 --> 00:59:39,142
[Leto] I see it.

835
00:59:39,242 --> 00:59:41,377
That's one of your harvesters.

836
00:59:44,047 --> 00:59:46,115
[dramatic music continues]

837
00:59:59,429 --> 01:00:01,598
[machinery clunking]

838
01:00:07,303 --> 01:00:08,471
[Dr. Kynes]
You can see the spice

839
01:00:08,571 --> 01:00:10,440
scattered over the surface.

840
01:00:11,941 --> 01:00:13,943
A rich spice bed

841
01:00:14,010 --> 01:00:15,478
by the color.

842
01:00:15,578 --> 01:00:18,081
If you get a little higher,
you'll have a better view.

843
01:00:32,795 --> 01:00:35,431
You see these spotter aircraft
looking for wormsign.

844
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:38,668
[Paul] Wormsign?

845
01:00:38,768 --> 01:00:41,037
A sand wave
moving toward the crawler.

846
01:00:41,137 --> 01:00:43,339
Worms travel deep
but get closer

847
01:00:43,439 --> 01:00:44,807
to the surface
when they attack.

848
01:00:45,608 --> 01:00:47,110
If you are patient,

849
01:00:47,977 --> 01:00:50,046
we should see one.

850
01:00:50,146 --> 01:00:51,614
A worm always comes?

851
01:00:51,681 --> 01:00:54,484
Always. They're drawn
by rhythmic noises.

852
01:00:54,550 --> 01:00:56,653
Why don't we just shield
the crawlers?

853
01:00:56,719 --> 01:00:59,222
A shield's a death sentence
in the desert.

854
01:00:59,322 --> 01:01:00,556
It attracts the worms

855
01:01:00,657 --> 01:01:03,326
and drives them
into a killing frenzy.

856
01:01:06,062 --> 01:01:07,130
Is that a worm?

857
01:01:19,342 --> 01:01:21,144
[Dr. Kynes] Big one.

858
01:01:21,210 --> 01:01:23,546
You have good eyes.

859
01:01:23,646 --> 01:01:25,882
Calling crawler
Delta Ajax niner.

860
01:01:25,982 --> 01:01:28,484
Wormsign warning. Acknowledge.

861
01:01:28,551 --> 01:01:31,254
[Crawler over radio]
Who calls Delta Ajax niner?

862
01:01:31,354 --> 01:01:32,388
Over.

863
01:01:32,488 --> 01:01:33,890
They seem pretty calm
about it.

864
01:01:33,990 --> 01:01:36,492
[Dr. Kynes] Unlisted flight.
Imperium business.

865
01:01:36,559 --> 01:01:38,728
Wormsign north
and east of you.

866
01:01:38,828 --> 01:01:40,830
3.7 kilometers.

867
01:01:40,897 --> 01:01:42,432
[Spotter over radio]
Delta Ajax niner,

868
01:01:42,532 --> 01:01:44,333
this is Spotter One.
Wormsign confirmed.

869
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:48,004
Stand by for contact fix.

870
01:01:51,541 --> 01:01:54,110
Worm is on intercept course
to your position.

871
01:01:54,210 --> 01:01:55,778
Contact in five minutes.

872
01:01:55,878 --> 01:01:57,680
So, what happens now?

873
01:01:57,747 --> 01:02:00,283
They'll call a carryall
to lift the crawler.

874
01:02:00,383 --> 01:02:02,518
They'll harvest right up
to the last minute.

875
01:02:02,585 --> 01:02:04,220
[Crawler]  Calling
carryall Alpha Zero.

876
01:02:04,287 --> 01:02:06,122
Ready for docking sequence.

877
01:02:06,222 --> 01:02:08,691
Contact five minutes. Over.

878
01:02:13,062 --> 01:02:15,198
[Spotter]  Anybody got a visual
on the carryall?

879
01:02:19,402 --> 01:02:20,903
[Dr. Kynes] There it is.

880
01:02:20,970 --> 01:02:22,305
[Carryall over radio]
This is carryall Alpha Zero

881
01:02:22,405 --> 01:02:24,741
to Delta Ajax niner.

882
01:02:24,807 --> 01:02:26,876
Approaching from your east.

883
01:02:26,943 --> 01:02:29,812
Correcting altitude and
preparing docking equipment.

884
01:02:29,912 --> 01:02:33,416
[Crawler]  Copy, Alpha Zero.
Initiating docking sequence.

885
01:02:35,451 --> 01:02:36,953
[Carryall]  T-5.

886
01:02:37,053 --> 01:02:38,488
[man]  Copy that.

887
01:02:38,588 --> 01:02:40,323
[Crawler]  Prepare
to be airborne in 30 seconds.

888
01:02:40,423 --> 01:02:42,725
[Carryall]  Docking sequence
initiated. Brace yourselves.

889
01:02:44,427 --> 01:02:45,995
[explosion]

890
01:02:46,095 --> 01:02:48,131
[man]  Alpha Zero, we're short
one point of contact.

891
01:02:48,231 --> 01:02:49,665
[Crawler]  What is going on?

892
01:02:49,766 --> 01:02:51,768
[Carryall]  It's one of
the anchors. It's dead.

893
01:02:52,769 --> 01:02:54,137
[Dr. Kynes] Shit.

894
01:02:54,237 --> 01:02:56,272
[Carryall]  Carryall
unable to receive.

895
01:02:56,339 --> 01:02:58,241
Unable to lift
without that anchor.

896
01:02:58,307 --> 01:03:00,009
[Crawler]  All call! All call!

897
01:03:00,109 --> 01:03:03,079
Any carryall in the sector,
please respond!

898
01:03:03,146 --> 01:03:05,114
Spotter One,
give us an update. Over.

899
01:03:05,181 --> 01:03:06,649
[Carryall]  Hydraulics are dead.

900

903
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:11,320
How many men on that crawler?

904
01:03:11,420 --> 01:03:12,488
Crew of 21.

905
01:03:12,588 --> 01:03:13,589
[Leto] Our ships
can take six each.

906
01:03:13,656 --> 01:03:14,824
That's still three short.

907
01:03:15,525 --> 01:03:16,592
We'll find a way.

This is Duke Leto Atreides.

909
01:03:31,207 --> 01:03:34,844
We're coming down to extract
the crew of Delta Ajax niner.

910
01:03:34,944 --> 01:03:36,946
We'll set down on the west.

weigh 100 kilos each.

912
01:03:49,992 --> 01:03:51,360
Yes, Gurney,

913
01:03:51,460 --> 01:03:52,728
have our escorts throw out
the shield generators.

914
01:03:52,829 --> 01:03:54,363
[Gurney] Yes, sire.

915
01:03:54,463 --> 01:03:56,032
[Leto] And, Paul, I want you
at the back of the thopter.

916
01:03:56,132 --> 01:03:57,200
Guide them in.

917
01:03:57,300 --> 01:03:58,501

Where are they?

927
01:05:10,106 --> 01:05:12,141
[Crawler]  Sir,
there's protocol for a reason.

928
01:05:12,241 --> 01:05:14,944
If we take one step out there,
we're as good as dead.

929
01:05:15,044 --> 01:05:16,646
Besides, we've got
a full load of spice.

930
01:05:16,746 --> 01:05:18,781
-We can't just leave it.
-Damn the spice!

931
01:05:18,881 --> 01:05:21,484
I want every man
off that crawler now!

Hey!

Bless the Maker and His Water.

958

and going of Him.

959
01:07:53,769 --> 01:07:56,705

cleanse the world

-You cannot take such risks.
-[Paul] Yes, sir.

01:08:26,735 --> 01:08:28,003
You have responsibilities.

965
01:08:28,104 --> 01:08:29,238
I... I'm sorry, sir.
It won't happen again.

966
01:08:29,305 --> 01:08:30,306
Go.

967
01:08:31,140 --> 01:08:32,441
Dr. Kynes.

968
01:08:34,276 --> 01:08:36,112
You saw it.

969
01:08:36,178 --> 01:08:38,180
With your own eyes.
It's plain to see.

970
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:40,516
Everything they've left us
is in shambles.

971
01:08:40,616 --> 01:08:42,518
We've been set up to fail.

972
01:08:42,618 --> 01:08:45,321
That carryall was just old.

973
01:08:45,421 --> 01:08:47,456
The desert
isn't kind to equipment.

974
01:08:49,325 --> 01:08:50,860
You know what will happen

975
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:53,462
if I don't get spice
production back on track.

977
01:08:55,431 --> 01:08:59,268
I'm not here
to take your part.

978
01:08:59,335 --> 01:09:03,372
Arrakis has seen men like you
come and go.

979
01:09:06,008 --> 01:09:09,645
Take good care of your family.

980
01:09:12,982 --> 01:09:16,118
The desert's not kind
to humans either.

981
01:09:32,501 --> 01:09:35,571
Spice is a psychoactive
chemical.

982
01:09:36,739 --> 01:09:38,707
You seem to be sensitive.

983
01:09:43,078 --> 01:09:44,146
You'll be fine.

984
01:09:45,848 --> 01:09:47,883

That wasn't
an allergic reaction.

01:10:09,572 --> 01:10:10,606

You can see.

992
01:11:36,358 --> 01:11:38,027
[Paul]  It's confusing.

993
01:11:38,127 --> 01:11:39,662
I thought I saw my death,

994
01:11:39,762 --> 01:11:41,930
only it wasn't.

995
01:11:41,997 --> 01:11:45,868
I know a knife is important,
somehow.

996
01:11:47,803 --> 01:11:50,172
Someone will hand me a blade,

997
01:11:50,272 --> 01:11:53,976
but I don't know who,
or when, or where.

998
01:11:56,045 --> 01:11:59,048
Some things, though,
are crystal clear.

999
01:11:59,148 --> 01:12:00,482
I can feel it.

1000
01:12:05,187 --> 01:12:06,722
I know you're pregnant.

1001
01:12:12,828 --> 01:12:14,630
You can't know that.

1002
01:12:16,165 --> 01:12:17,366
I barely know that.

1003
01:12:17,466 --> 01:12:19,468

Don't think I want to know.

Ever since you brought him
before your Reverend Mother,

1022
01:14:19,688 --> 01:14:21,523
he hasn't been the same.

1023
01:14:23,192 --> 01:14:24,493
He's distracted.

1024

1025

And from the moment
he was born,

1026
01:14:31,099 --> 01:14:32,968
I never questioned you.

1027
01:14:33,035 --> 01:14:35,504
I trusted you completely.

[guards] Atreides!

1081
01:21:31,052 --> 01:21:33,021
[all grunting in unison]

1082
01:21:34,623 --> 01:21:36,725

[groaning]

1086
01:22:21,770 --> 01:22:23,438
I'm sorry, my lord.

1087
01:22:26,274 --> 01:22:29,244
But I've made a bargain
with the Baron.

1088
01:22:29,311 --> 01:22:31,680
[Leto breathing raggedly]

1089
01:22:31,780 --> 01:22:32,781
Why?

1090
01:22:33,648 --> 01:22:35,684
I had no choice.

1091
01:22:35,784 --> 01:22:39,621
The Harkonnens
have my wife, Wanna.

1092
01:22:39,688 --> 01:22:42,257
They take her apart
like a doll.

1093
01:22:43,258 --> 01:22:45,360
I will buy her freedom.

1094
01:22:45,460 --> 01:22:47,028
And you are the price.

1095
01:22:50,365 --> 01:22:53,435
For Paul.
I will do what I can.

1096
01:22:54,135 --> 01:22:55,837
And you

1097
01:22:55,937 --> 01:22:57,806
will kill a man for me.

1098
01:23:02,177 --> 01:23:05,714
I'm going to replace
your peg tooth.

1099
01:23:05,814 --> 01:23:10,719
If you bite down hard,
this tooth will crush.

1100
01:23:10,819 --> 01:23:15,056
Breathe out, and you will
fill the air with poison.

1101
01:23:15,156 --> 01:23:17,859
It will be your last breath.

1102
01:23:17,959 --> 01:23:20,295
But if you choose
your moment well,

1103
01:23:21,563 --> 01:23:23,865
it will also be the Baron's.

1104
01:23:42,250 --> 01:23:44,252
[tense music playing]

1105
01:24:02,103 --> 01:24:03,505

1109
01:24:57,592 --> 01:24:58,660
Paul.

[grunts]

1118
01:26:44,032 --> 01:26:45,400
[alarm beeping]

1119
01:27:58,840 --> 01:28:01,643
[trooper 1 in English]
I've never had a highborn.

1120
01:28:04,012 --> 01:28:05,346
You?

1121
01:28:05,446 --> 01:28:07,515
Bene Gesserit
ain't all highborn.

1122
01:28:07,615 --> 01:28:11,419
[trooper 1]
She's highborn enough for me.

1123
01:28:11,486 --> 01:28:13,755
Let's feed the kid
to the worms.

1124
01:28:13,821 --> 01:28:15,823
And give her a long goodbye.

1125
01:28:15,923 --> 01:28:17,692
Don't you dare
touch my mother.

1126
01:28:19,160 --> 01:28:20,194
Don't talk.

1127
01:28:26,467 --> 01:28:27,802

1128
01:28:29,137 --> 01:28:30,672
[Paul sighs]

1129
01:28:31,539 --> 01:28:33,041
[sternly] Remove her gag.

1130
01:28:41,149 --> 01:28:42,050
[retches]

1131
01:28:42,150 --> 01:28:43,951

[Paul breathing deeply]

1136
01:29:12,880 --> 01:29:14,148
[in distorted voice]
Remove her gag.

1137
01:29:20,221 --> 01:29:21,422
[in distorted voice] Kill him.

1138
01:29:30,398 --> 01:29:31,566
[in distorted voice]
Set us free.

[Lady Jessica grunting]

1142
01:29:45,046 --> 01:29:46,381
[in distorted voice] Stop!

1143
01:29:46,447 --> 01:29:48,015
Cut the rope.

1144
01:29:50,718 --> 01:29:52,186
Give me the knife.

1145
01:29:52,787 --> 01:29:54,088

[grunts]

1147
01:30:00,895 --> 01:30:03,965
[in normal voice]
Your pitch was too forced.

1148
01:30:11,873 --> 01:30:13,441
[Paul] It's a fremkit.

1149
01:30:17,412 --> 01:30:19,981
[man speaks Harkonnen
over radio]

1150
01:30:24,118 --> 01:30:26,320
[engine shuts off]

1151
01:30:26,421 --> 01:30:27,622
They've crippled the ship.

1152
01:30:43,304 --> 01:30:44,472
[distant explosions]

1153
01:30:53,281 --> 01:30:54,582

[munching]

1163
01:32:03,017 --> 01:32:06,087
You have a wonderful kitchen,
cousin.

[Paul grunts]

1166
01:32:24,272 --> 01:32:27,108
This is Dr. Yueh's
handwriting.

1167
01:32:27,208 --> 01:32:29,777
"If anyone makes it out
of Arrakeen alive,

1168
01:32:29,877 --> 01:32:32,013
there's an Atreides beacon
in the fremkit.

1169
01:32:32,079 --> 01:32:34,849
God willing,
they'll be able to find you."

[wheezing weakly]

1171
01:32:42,189 --> 01:32:43,224
My lord Baron.

1172
01:32:44,625 --> 01:32:45,793
Dr. Yueh.

1173
01:32:45,893 --> 01:32:47,562
[Vladimir] The traitor.

1174
01:32:48,763 --> 01:32:49,897
What do you want?

1175
01:32:51,065 --> 01:32:53,301
I jammed their comms

1176
01:32:53,401 --> 01:32:55,403
and lowered their shields.

1177
01:32:55,469 --> 01:32:56,737
[Vladimir] Hmm.

1178
01:32:56,804 --> 01:32:59,073
[Dr. Yueh] I delivered
the Duke and his family.

1179
01:32:59,140 --> 01:33:01,642
[Vladimir] The bargain
to the letter.

1180
01:33:01,742 --> 01:33:04,245
And what was I to do for you?

1181
01:33:04,312 --> 01:33:06,480
Deliver my wife
from her agony.

1182
01:33:08,416 --> 01:33:09,483
[Vladimir] Yes.

1183
01:33:11,919 --> 01:33:13,988

[chewing loudly]

1185
01:33:42,950 --> 01:33:45,586
I said I'd set her free.

1186
01:33:45,653 --> 01:33:47,488
That you could join her.

1187
01:33:50,458 --> 01:33:51,525
[Dr. Yueh grunts]

1188
01:33:51,626 --> 01:33:53,527
So, join her.

1190

What do you think is next?

1191
01:34:08,342 --> 01:34:10,645
[Paul] It's a thumper.

1192
01:34:10,711 --> 01:34:12,313
No stillsuits.

1193
01:34:12,380 --> 01:34:14,315
The one thing
we actually need.

1194
01:34:19,387 --> 01:34:22,990
For hundreds of years,
we've traded blood for blood.

1195
01:34:24,191 --> 01:34:25,860
But no more.

1196
01:34:27,328 --> 01:34:31,565
Your son is dead.
Your concubine is dead.

1197
01:34:31,666 --> 01:34:34,535
Tonight
the House of Atreides falls.

1198
01:34:37,338 --> 01:34:40,408
And your bloodline
ends forever.

[Leto mumbling]

1200
01:34:53,587 --> 01:34:54,655
What did you say?

1201
01:35:04,699 --> 01:35:06,167
[softly] Here I am...

1202
01:35:07,435 --> 01:35:09,236
here I remain.

It's not safe for you here.

1213
01:36:56,811 --> 01:36:58,045
[Duncan] Will you tell
the Great Houses

1214
01:36:58,145 --> 01:36:59,613
of the Landsraad
how we were betrayed?

1215
01:36:59,680 --> 01:37:02,283
How the best of them
were murdered?

1216
01:37:02,349 --> 01:37:05,019
I am commanded to say nothing.

1217
01:37:05,986 --> 01:37:07,688
To see nothing.

1218
01:37:09,523 --> 01:37:11,892
The Emperor
sent us here to die.

Paul, you're scared.
I can see it.

1238
01:40:05,165 --> 01:40:08,235
Tell me, please,
what do you fear?

It's coming.

1243
01:40:25,686 --> 01:40:27,087
I see a holy war spreading

across the universe
like unquenchable fire.

1245
01:40:29,189 --> 01:40:32,192

Paul Atreides.

1254
01:40:50,577 --> 01:40:53,547
You are your father's son.
You are my son.

1255
01:40:53,614 --> 01:40:57,117
You are
the Duke Paul Atreides.

1256

You know who you are.
You know who you are.

[in distorted voice]
Get off me!

1258

[normal voice]
You did this to me!

1259
01:41:04,925 --> 01:41:07,628
You Bene Gesserit

[breathing heavily]

1261
01:41:25,612 --> 01:41:27,648
[Paul crying]

1262
01:41:32,753 --> 01:41:35,055
My father is dead.

1263
01:41:35,122 --> 01:41:37,157
[Paul sobbing]

1264
01:41:42,429 --> 01:41:44,731
[mournful music playing]

1265
01:42:05,619 --> 01:42:07,654
[device beeping]

1266
01:42:11,525 --> 01:42:13,026
[Paul softly] Someone's near.

1267
01:42:13,961 --> 01:42:15,462
You need to drink.

1268
01:42:17,030 --> 01:42:19,333
It's recycled water
from the tent.

1269
01:42:27,141 --> 01:42:28,942
Sweat and tears.

1270
01:42:32,613 --> 01:42:34,314
All right,
let's get out of here.

1271
01:42:37,985 --> 01:42:40,020
[device whirring]

1272
01:42:41,321 --> 01:42:43,357

1273

[whimpers]

1276
01:43:10,017 --> 01:43:12,085
[muffled whirring]

1277
01:43:16,590 --> 01:43:18,225
[grunting and panting]

1278
01:43:27,601 --> 01:43:28,769
[squeaks]

1279
01:43:32,172 --> 01:43:33,507
[Paul grunts]

1280
01:43:34,441 --> 01:43:36,510
[Lady Jessica panting]

1281
01:43:36,577 --> 01:43:38,412
[engine roaring]

1282
01:43:47,554 --> 01:43:49,289
That's Duncan.

1283
01:43:56,396 --> 01:43:57,631
Duncan.

1284
01:43:57,731 --> 01:43:59,199
[panting]

1285
01:43:59,266 --> 01:44:00,467
My lady.

1286
01:44:00,567 --> 01:44:01,969
Paul.

1287
01:44:02,069 --> 01:44:04,438
I'm so sorry. Your father...

1288
01:44:04,538 --> 01:44:05,739
We know.

1289
01:44:07,641 --> 01:44:08,976
My lord Duke.

1290
01:44:22,756 --> 01:44:23,757
Here.

1291
01:44:25,826 --> 01:44:27,327
Drink this.

1292
01:44:34,601 --> 01:44:36,970
[Duncan] Harkonnens hit
every population center

1293
01:44:37,070 --> 01:44:38,505
on the planet at once.

1294
01:44:38,605 --> 01:44:40,741
There must have been
10 legions, hundreds of ships.

1295
01:44:40,807 --> 01:44:42,843
There were Sardaukar
with them.

1296
01:44:42,943 --> 01:44:45,479
-At least two battalions.
-What? Are you sure?

1297
01:44:45,579 --> 01:44:48,248
You cross swords
with a Sardaukar,

1298
01:44:48,315 --> 01:44:49,683
you know it.

1299
01:44:49,783 --> 01:44:54,521
[Lady Jessica sighs] So,
the Emperor's taken a side.

1300
01:44:54,621 --> 01:44:57,758
What says
the Judge of the Change?

1301
01:44:57,824 --> 01:44:59,860
The Emperor forbids me
from saying anything at all.

1302
01:44:59,960 --> 01:45:01,928
And yet you risk your life
to help us.

1303
01:45:10,370 --> 01:45:11,672
[thunder rumbling]

1304
01:45:16,777 --> 01:45:18,545
[man shouting]

1305

-[thunder continues rumbling]
-[clamoring]

1306
01:45:22,382 --> 01:45:24,117
[worker] Storm's coming.

1307
01:45:27,187 --> 01:45:28,889
[workers shouting
indistinctly]

1308
01:45:37,998 --> 01:45:40,233
[Dr. Kynes] The storm
will be here in a few hours.

1309
01:45:40,334 --> 01:45:41,468
We'll be safe here.

1310
01:45:43,003 --> 01:45:45,238
Do you know
what this place is?

1311
01:45:45,339 --> 01:45:47,741
It's an old
ecological testing station.

1312
01:45:51,144 --> 01:45:52,979
They were meant
to tame the planet.

1313
01:45:53,046 --> 01:45:55,482
Free the water
locked beneath the sands.

1314
01:45:58,485 --> 01:46:01,088
Arrakis could have been
a paradise.

1315
01:46:01,188 --> 01:46:02,322
The work had begun,

1316
01:46:02,389 --> 01:46:04,057
but then the spice
was discovered.

1317
01:46:04,157 --> 01:46:07,160
And suddenly no one
wanted the desert to go away.

1318
01:46:07,227 --> 01:46:08,428
Tanat,

1319
01:46:08,528 --> 01:46:10,097
will you find stillsuits
to fit our visitors?

1320
01:46:10,197 --> 01:46:11,431
TANAT: Yes, Liet.

1321
01:46:11,531 --> 01:46:12,933
[Dr. Kynes] Shamir,
a coffee service, please.

1322
01:46:13,033 --> 01:46:14,501
SHAMIR: Of course, Liet.

1323
01:46:15,569 --> 01:46:16,737
[door unlocks]

1324
01:46:16,837 --> 01:46:18,739
Who are you to the Fremen?

1325
01:46:44,297 --> 01:46:46,400
[indistinct chatter]

1326
01:46:56,076 --> 01:46:57,978
[wind howling]

1327
01:47:08,755 --> 01:47:10,490
[Paul] You know what
the Great Houses fear most,

1328
01:47:10,590 --> 01:47:12,159
Dr. Kynes?

1329
01:47:13,427 --> 01:47:15,662
Exactly what has happened
to us here.

1330
01:47:16,663 --> 01:47:17,831
The Sardaukar coming

1331
01:47:17,931 --> 01:47:19,633
and picking them off
one by one.

1332
01:47:22,602 --> 01:47:24,237
Only together
can they stand a chance

1333
01:47:24,304 --> 01:47:25,806
against the Imperium.

1334
01:47:27,841 --> 01:47:30,010
Would you bear witness?

1335
01:47:30,110 --> 01:47:33,246
Testify that the Emperor
has moved against us here?

1336
01:47:33,313 --> 01:47:36,249
If they believe me,

1337
01:47:36,316 --> 01:47:38,018
there would be general warfare

1338
01:47:38,118 --> 01:47:40,320
between the Great Houses
and the Emperor.

1339
01:47:40,420 --> 01:47:41,988
Chaos

1340
01:47:42,088 --> 01:47:43,523
across the Imperium.

1341
01:47:43,623 --> 01:47:45,025
Suppose I presented
the Emperor

1342
01:47:45,125 --> 01:47:47,594
with an alternative to chaos.

1343
01:47:47,661 --> 01:47:49,596
The Emperor has no sons.

1344
01:47:49,663 --> 01:47:51,665
And his daughters
have yet to marry.

1345
01:47:51,765 --> 01:47:54,534
You'd make a play
for the throne?

1346
01:47:54,634 --> 01:47:56,369
The Emperor
feared the Atreides.

1347
01:47:56,470 --> 01:47:58,138
He brought you here
to kill you.

1348
01:47:58,205 --> 01:48:00,707
What don't you understand?

1349
01:48:00,807 --> 01:48:03,977
You're a lost boy hiding
in a hole in the ground.

1350
01:48:08,181 --> 01:48:10,951
The Fremen speak
of the  Lisan al-Gaib.

1351
01:48:11,952 --> 01:48:13,787
Careful.

1352
01:48:13,854 --> 01:48:15,021
The Voice from the Outer World

1353
01:48:15,121 --> 01:48:17,290
who will lead them
to paradise.

1354
01:48:18,625 --> 01:48:19,826
Superstition.

1355
01:48:24,631 --> 01:48:26,366
I know you loved
a Fremen warrior

1356
01:48:26,466 --> 01:48:27,734
and lost him in battle.

1357
01:48:30,971 --> 01:48:34,674
I know you walk in two worlds
and are known by many names.

1358
01:48:39,913 --> 01:48:41,815
I've seen your dream.

1359
01:48:45,919 --> 01:48:47,153
As emperor, Dr. Kynes,

1360
01:48:47,220 --> 01:48:49,155
I could make
a paradise of Arrakis

1361
01:48:49,222 --> 01:48:50,757
with a wave of my hand.

[Paul] Duncan!

1384
01:51:54,374 --> 01:51:55,942
We have to go.
We have no choice.

1385

You'll find a thopter
ready to fly.

1395

is your best shot.

1396
01:53:03,910 --> 01:53:06,479
Above 5,000 meters,
it's mostly dust.

1397
01:53:06,579 --> 01:53:10,683
Climb into it. Stay on top.
Head south. Find the Fremen.

1398
01:53:10,784 --> 01:53:12,018
Are you not coming with us?

1399
01:53:12,118 --> 01:53:13,319
It only seats two.

1400
01:53:13,419 --> 01:53:15,121
I'll go to the next station

1401
01:53:15,188 --> 01:53:16,923
and report this attack
to the Landsraad.

1402
01:53:16,990 --> 01:53:18,291
[Lady Jessica] How?

1403
01:53:19,025 --> 01:53:20,960
I'm Fremen.

1404
01:53:21,027 --> 01:53:23,263

1439
01:58:09,148 --> 01:58:10,817
Fear is the mind-killer.

1440
01:58:10,917 --> 01:58:14,654
Fear is the little death
that brings obliteration.

1441
01:58:14,754 --> 01:58:16,255
[rumbling and clanking stop]

1442
01:58:20,259 --> 01:58:23,229
[voices whispering]
See the friend.

1443
01:58:26,999 --> 01:58:29,902
See the friend.

1444
01:58:32,605 --> 01:58:35,408
[Jamis]  The mystery of life
isn't a problem to solve...

1445
01:58:38,611 --> 01:58:40,980
but a reality to experience.

1446
01:58:44,283 --> 01:58:46,519
A process
that cannot be understood

1447
01:58:46,619 --> 01:58:48,855
by stopping it.

1448
01:58:48,955 --> 01:58:51,357
We must move
with the flow of the process.

1449
01:58:52,325 --> 01:58:54,827
We must join it.

1450
01:58:54,927 --> 01:58:56,696
We must flow with it.

1451
01:58:56,796 --> 01:58:58,431
[voices]  Let go.

1452
01:58:58,498 --> 01:59:00,500
Let go.

-[water bubbling]
-[breathes heavily]

1458
01:59:47,346 --> 01:59:51,484
[in English] We chased them
into a Coriolis storm.

1459
01:59:52,985 --> 01:59:55,555
Winds at 800 kilometers
an hour.

1460
02:00:00,226 --> 02:00:02,528
Nothing survives such a storm.

1461
02:00:02,595 --> 02:00:04,030
They're dead.

1462
02:00:05,431 --> 02:00:07,266
It's a certainty.

1463
02:00:12,104 --> 02:00:13,339
[grunts]

1464
02:00:14,273 --> 02:00:16,576
So, it's done. Finally.

1465
02:00:18,711 --> 02:00:20,546
Send word to Giedi Prime

1466
02:00:20,613 --> 02:00:23,449
to begin selling
our spice reserves.

1467
02:00:24,283 --> 02:00:26,385
But slowly.

1468
02:00:26,452 --> 02:00:29,121
We don't want
the price to fall.

1469
02:00:29,222 --> 02:00:30,723
You have no idea
how much it cost me

1470
02:00:30,790 --> 02:00:33,292
to bring such a force
to bear here.

1471
02:00:33,392 --> 02:00:36,262
Now I only have
one requirement.

1472
02:00:36,362 --> 02:00:37,463
Income.

1473
02:00:38,297 --> 02:00:40,099
So, squeeze, Rabban.

1474
02:00:40,866 --> 02:00:42,301
Squeeze hard.

1475
02:00:42,401 --> 02:00:43,769
Yes, Uncle.

1476
02:00:45,371 --> 02:00:46,472
And the Fremen?

1477
02:00:47,607 --> 02:00:49,041
Kill them all.

[rumbling]

1505
02:05:18,978 --> 02:05:21,247
[Paul over mask]  Now
we have to find the Fremen.

02:05:22,815 --> 02:05:24,149
Are you good?

1507
02:05:24,216 --> 02:05:25,584
[Lady Jessica]  Yeah.

Don't be frightened.

1511
02:06:44,663 --> 02:06:47,900
[girl]  Even a little
desert mouse can survive.

1512
02:06:48,934 --> 02:06:52,104
[voices]  Don't be frightened.

1513
02:06:52,171 --> 02:06:54,006
[girl]  You'll need
to face your fears.

1514
02:06:54,106 --> 02:06:55,674
[voices]  A friend...

1515
02:06:55,774 --> 02:06:58,911
A friend will help you.

1516
02:07:00,279 --> 02:07:02,114
Follow the friend.

1517
02:07:04,950 --> 02:07:06,285
[Jamis]
You have much to learn.

1518
02:07:08,487 --> 02:07:11,290
And I will show you
the ways of the desert.

1519
02:07:14,627 --> 02:07:16,195
Come with me.

1520
02:07:22,301 --> 02:07:24,436
[mysterious music playing]

1521
02:07:43,822 --> 02:07:47,559
[Paul]  The  sietch
where Duncan lived

1522
02:07:47,660 --> 02:07:49,828
is somewhere off that way.

1523
02:07:51,997 --> 02:07:55,000
[Lady Jessica]  I can see
greenery over there.

1524
02:07:55,067 --> 02:07:56,235
There.

1525
02:07:56,335 --> 02:07:58,337
[Paul]  That means
Fremen live there.

1526
02:08:02,675 --> 02:08:04,810
We'll cross after dark.

1527
02:08:04,877 --> 02:08:06,879
That's how the Fremen do it.

1528
02:08:09,848 --> 02:08:12,351
[Paul]  We're about to enter
worm territory.

1529
02:08:12,418 --> 02:08:14,253
We can't walk
like regular humans.

1530
02:08:14,353 --> 02:08:15,754
If we do, we're dead.

1531
02:08:15,854 --> 02:08:17,856
We'll have to walk
like the Fremen do.

1532
02:08:17,923 --> 02:08:19,491
It's called a sandwalk.

1533
02:08:19,558 --> 02:08:22,227
At least according
to the filmbooks back home.

1534
02:08:22,327 --> 02:08:23,729

Yeah. Yeah, okay.

1535

Do the same moves.

[Paul]  It's a thumper.

1561
02:11:46,899 --> 02:11:48,901
Someone set off a thumper.

1562
02:11:50,969 --> 02:11:52,104

That was insane.

[Stilgar over mask]
Do not run.

1576
02:13:03,842 --> 02:13:06,478
You will only waste
your body's water.

1577
02:13:07,479 --> 02:13:08,513
Hold.

1578
02:13:16,188 --> 02:13:17,055
Stilgar.

-Hey!

1580
02:13:18,824 --> 02:13:20,058
You know me. I was there

1581
02:13:20,158 --> 02:13:21,893
when you came
to my father's Council.

1582
02:13:21,994 --> 02:13:22,961
[Stilgar] Oh.

1583
02:13:23,028 --> 02:13:25,063
This is the Duke's son.

1584
02:13:25,163 --> 02:13:26,798
[Jamis] Why are you waiting?

1585
02:13:26,865 --> 02:13:28,734
We need their water.

1586
02:13:28,834 --> 02:13:31,069
[Stilgar] This is the boy
I told you about.

1587
02:13:31,169 --> 02:13:32,404
We can't touch him.

[woman speaking Fremen]

1589
02:13:36,808 --> 02:13:38,176
[Jamis in English]
They are weaklings.

02:13:38,243 --> 02:13:40,012
[Stilgar] Jamis.

1591
02:13:40,078 --> 02:13:41,980
That was a brave crossing
they made

1592
02:13:42,047 --> 02:13:44,916
in the path of  Shai-Hulud.

1593
02:13:45,017 --> 02:13:48,153
He does not speak
or act like a weakling.

1594
02:13:49,187 --> 02:13:50,889
Nor did his father.

1595
02:13:50,989 --> 02:13:53,592
[Jamis] My thumper
saved his life.

1596
02:13:53,692 --> 02:13:56,161
Go back to reason, Stilgar.

1597
02:13:56,228 --> 02:13:57,929
He's not The One.

1598
02:13:59,664 --> 02:14:00,599

1599
02:14:00,699 --> 02:14:02,367
We have powerful friends.

1600
02:14:02,434 --> 02:14:05,604
You help us off-world,
to Caladan,

1601
02:14:05,704 --> 02:14:06,938
you will be well rewarded.

1602
02:14:07,039 --> 02:14:09,841
What wealth can you offer
beyond the water

1603
02:14:09,908 --> 02:14:11,443
in your flesh?

1604
02:14:14,246 --> 02:14:16,281
[Stilgar] Hmm...

1605
02:14:16,381 --> 02:14:18,016
The boy is young.

1606
02:14:18,083 --> 02:14:20,285
He can learn our ways.

1607
02:14:20,385 --> 02:14:23,021
He may have sanctuary.

1608
02:14:23,088 --> 02:14:25,424
But the woman is untrained...

1609
02:14:28,093 --> 02:14:29,594
and too old to learn.

She'll cut my throat.

1616
02:15:11,903 --> 02:15:14,406
Why didn't you say
you were a weirding woman?

1617
02:15:14,473 --> 02:15:16,141
And a fighter?

1618
02:15:16,241 --> 02:15:18,410
Conversation ran short.

1619
02:15:18,477 --> 02:15:20,679
[Stilgar] Peace, woman.

1620
02:15:20,779 --> 02:15:22,114
Peace.

1621
02:15:22,914 --> 02:15:24,449
I judged hastily.

1622
02:15:28,520 --> 02:15:29,621
[sniffs]

1623
02:15:30,789 --> 02:15:32,424
[Stilgar grunts]

1624
02:15:33,492 --> 02:15:35,260
[speaking Chakobsa]

1625
02:16:03,655 --> 02:16:06,057
[girl in English]  I would not
have let you hurt my friends.

1626
02:16:31,349 --> 02:16:33,919
They say you're the  Mahdi.

1627
02:16:34,019 --> 02:16:35,854
But you look
like a little boy.

1628
02:16:37,355 --> 02:16:38,823
You chose the hardest way up.

1629
02:16:38,890 --> 02:16:40,225
Follow me.

1630
02:16:43,828 --> 02:16:45,530
[Stilgar speaking Chakobsa]

1631
02:16:47,699 --> 02:16:49,267
[in English] Give it to me.

1632
02:16:56,208 --> 02:16:57,909
You will have
your own maula pistol

1633
02:16:58,009 --> 02:16:59,911
when you've earned it.

1634
02:17:00,011 --> 02:17:01,046
Give it to me.

1635
02:17:06,785 --> 02:17:08,920
Chani, take charge
of the newcomers.

1636
02:17:09,020 --> 02:17:11,623
See that they are safe
on the journey. Let's go.

1637
02:17:11,723 --> 02:17:13,124
[Jamis] I will not have them.

1638
02:17:20,065 --> 02:17:21,466
[Stilgar] Jamis,

1639
02:17:21,566 --> 02:17:23,902
I have spoken. Be still.

1640
02:17:23,969 --> 02:17:25,570
[Jamis] You talk like a leader.

1641
02:17:26,571 --> 02:17:28,440
But the strongest leads.

1642
02:17:29,741 --> 02:17:31,543
She bested you.

1643
02:17:32,944 --> 02:17:35,246
I invoke the amtal.

1644
02:17:35,313 --> 02:17:37,749
[Stilgar] You may not challenge
a  Sayyadina.

1645
02:17:37,816 --> 02:17:39,317
Then who will fight
in her name?

1646
02:17:39,417 --> 02:17:42,153
Jamis, don't do this.

1647
02:17:42,254 --> 02:17:44,322
Don't. The night is fading.

1648
02:17:44,422 --> 02:17:47,325
Then the sun
will witness this death.

1649
02:17:47,425 --> 02:17:49,461
Where is her champion?

1650
02:18:00,305 --> 02:18:02,307
I accept her champion.

1651
02:18:25,463 --> 02:18:27,599
[slow dramatic music playing]

1652
02:18:31,803 --> 02:18:32,971
[grunting]

1653
02:18:34,472 --> 02:18:38,376
[voices]  Paul Atreides
must die...

1654
02:18:40,145 --> 02:18:44,849
for  Kwisatz Haderach  to rise.

1655
02:18:47,519 --> 02:18:51,222
Don't be frightened.

1656
02:18:51,323 --> 02:18:52,891
Don't resist.

1657
02:18:58,963 --> 02:19:00,899
When you take a life,

1658
02:19:01,833 --> 02:19:03,968
you take your own.

1659
02:19:11,976 --> 02:19:13,044
[moans]

1660
02:19:27,092 --> 02:19:28,360
[breathing heavily]

1661
02:19:35,734 --> 02:19:38,203
I don't believe
you're the  Lisan al-Gaib.

1662
02:19:39,704 --> 02:19:41,740
But I want you
to die with honor.

1663
02:19:53,218 --> 02:19:56,054
This crysknife was given to me
by my great aunt.

1664
02:19:59,290 --> 02:20:01,693
It's made
from a tooth of  Shai-Hulud.

1665
02:20:01,760 --> 02:20:03,461
The great sandworm.

1666
02:20:05,096 --> 02:20:07,899
This will be a great honor,
for you to die holding it.

1667
02:20:12,203 --> 02:20:14,572
[Jamis shouts]
Where is the Outworlder?

1668
02:20:18,910 --> 02:20:20,812
Jamis is a good fighter.

1669
02:20:21,780 --> 02:20:23,448
He won't let you suffer.

1670
02:20:24,916 --> 02:20:26,551
Chani...

1671
02:20:29,654 --> 02:20:30,722
Um...

1672
02:20:36,661 --> 02:20:37,762
[scoffs]

1673
02:20:38,763 --> 02:20:39,964
Never mind.

1674
02:20:52,610 --> 02:20:54,813
[slow dramatic music
continues]

1675
02:21:35,320 --> 02:21:37,489
May thy knife
chip and shatter.

1676
02:21:45,296 --> 02:21:47,232
You should welcome my blade.

1677
02:21:50,735 --> 02:21:52,504
This world will kill you.

1678
02:21:55,874 --> 02:21:57,408
Quicker this way.

1679
02:22:04,816 --> 02:22:06,518
[spectators speak Chakobsa
in unison]

1680
02:22:08,353 --> 02:22:11,222
-[man speaks Chakobsa]
-[Jamis grunting]

1681
02:22:16,027 --> 02:22:17,829
[breathing heavily]

1682
02:22:37,048 --> 02:22:38,683
-Do you yield?
-[spectators exclaim]

1683
02:22:38,750 --> 02:22:40,852
[Stilgar speaking Chakobsa]

1684
02:22:40,919 --> 02:22:42,787
[Stilgar in English]
The boy doesn't know our rule.

1685
02:22:42,887 --> 02:22:44,122
[yells]

1686
02:22:44,222 --> 02:22:45,790
There's no yielding
under the amtal rule.

1687
02:22:45,890 --> 02:22:47,559
Only death is the test of it.

1688
02:22:47,625 --> 02:22:49,594
[Jamis yelling]

1689
02:22:52,230 --> 02:22:53,898
[both grunting]

1690
02:22:55,967 --> 02:22:57,902
-Is he toying with him?
-No.

1691
02:22:59,237 --> 02:23:00,905
Paul has never killed a man.

1692
02:23:02,974 --> 02:23:04,242
[both grunt]

1693
02:23:06,077 --> 02:23:07,245
[yelling]

1694
02:23:09,480 --> 02:23:11,583
[dramatic lamentation music
playing]

1695
02:23:11,649 --> 02:23:16,087
[voices] Kwisatz Haderach.

1696
02:23:16,154 --> 02:23:17,255
[yelling]

1697
02:23:19,123 --> 02:23:22,160
Kwisatz Haderach.

1698
02:23:22,260 --> 02:23:26,130
Climb up. Rise.

1699
02:23:28,066 --> 02:23:29,100
[stabs]

1700
02:23:29,801 --> 02:23:31,102
[grunts]

1701
02:23:48,119 --> 02:23:49,821
[Jamis groaning]

1702
02:24:02,834 --> 02:24:04,936
[mournful music playing]

1703
02:24:34,198 --> 02:24:36,300
[mournful music continues]

1704
02:25:13,905 --> 02:25:15,506
[speaking Chakobsa]

1705
02:25:18,543 --> 02:25:20,445
[in English]
You're one of us now.

1706
02:25:20,545 --> 02:25:22,380
A life for a life.

1707
02:25:22,447 --> 02:25:24,515
Come with us to  Sietch  Tabr.

1708
02:25:24,582 --> 02:25:25,616
No.

1709
02:25:25,717 --> 02:25:27,251
Paul needs to get off-world.

1710
02:25:27,351 --> 02:25:29,420
You must have ways.
You have smugglers,

1711
02:25:29,520 --> 02:25:30,755
you have ships.

1712
02:25:30,855 --> 02:25:32,957
-[Paul] No.
-[Lady Jessica] You have...

1713
02:25:33,057 --> 02:25:35,126
The Emperor sent us
to this place.

1714
02:25:36,561 --> 02:25:38,296
And my father came,

1715
02:25:39,230 --> 02:25:41,532
not for spice,

1716
02:25:41,599 --> 02:25:43,901
not for the riches,

1717
02:25:43,968 --> 02:25:46,104
but for the strength
of your people.

1718
02:25:49,107 --> 02:25:51,209
My road leads into the desert.

1719
02:25:53,878 --> 02:25:55,246
I can see it.

1720
02:25:57,749 --> 02:25:59,383
If you'll have us,

1721
02:26:00,284 --> 02:26:01,886
we will come.

1722
02:26:08,092 --> 02:26:10,228
[slow dramatic music playing]

1723
02:26:50,501 --> 02:26:52,003
Desert power.

1724
02:26:53,304 --> 02:26:55,006
This is only the beginning.
