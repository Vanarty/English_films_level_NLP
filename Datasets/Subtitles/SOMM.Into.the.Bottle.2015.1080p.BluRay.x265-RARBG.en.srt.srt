1
00:00:23,088 --> 00:00:25,424
What-- What is a sommelier?

2
00:00:25,491 --> 00:00:28,860
A sommelier is a position
in a restaurant.

3
00:00:28,894 --> 00:00:32,431
Who is responsible
for the wine program.

4
00:00:32,431 --> 00:00:34,333
They oversee service
to the guests.

5
00:00:34,366 --> 00:00:36,535
That's a very simple way
to look at it.

6
00:00:36,535 --> 00:00:38,203
You know,
and I'm just keeping
people happy.

7
00:00:38,203 --> 00:00:40,372
I'm popping corks,
a very simple job.

8
00:00:40,372 --> 00:00:42,374
But that is open
to interpretation.

9
00:00:42,408 --> 00:00:43,909
If you don't work
in a restaurant,

10
00:00:43,909 --> 00:00:46,177
you're not a sommelier.

11
00:00:46,211 --> 00:00:48,280
That's end of story, period.

12
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:51,116
Yeah, I don't agree.

13
00:00:51,182 --> 00:00:52,618
So a sommelier is somebody

14
00:00:52,618 --> 00:00:54,920
that takes care of wine,
period.

15
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:57,423
Somms are now educators.

16
00:00:57,423 --> 00:00:58,957
They're judges.

17
00:00:59,024 --> 00:01:00,459
They are suppliers.

18
00:01:00,459 --> 00:01:01,793
They are distributors.

19
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:03,529
As soon as I stop working
the floor,

20
00:01:03,529 --> 00:01:05,196
I'm no longer a sommelier,
though.

21
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:06,565
I feel like a sommelier

22
00:01:06,565 --> 00:01:09,568
when I'm opening
a $5 bottle of wine

23
00:01:09,568 --> 00:01:12,904
with a $300 corkscrew.

24
00:01:12,938 --> 00:01:16,708
In today's world, sommelier
seems to be very cool word

25
00:01:16,708 --> 00:01:18,744
where you can put
on your business card.

26
00:01:19,945 --> 00:01:21,046
I'd like to be alive

27
00:01:21,046 --> 00:01:22,548
when that definition
is finally written

28
00:01:22,581 --> 00:01:24,583
to my satisfaction.

29
00:01:24,616 --> 00:01:25,884
Can there be
any other business

30
00:01:25,884 --> 00:01:27,118
where there's
so much bullshit?

31
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:09,194
[no audible dialogue]

32
00:03:02,213 --> 00:03:04,082
[man]
To take all of the amount
of information

33
00:03:04,082 --> 00:03:06,518
in a sommelier's brain
and translate it

34
00:03:06,552 --> 00:03:08,554
into a digestible form
for a guest is not easy.

35
00:03:08,554 --> 00:03:09,855
It's because there's--

36
00:03:09,855 --> 00:03:11,523
there's so many things
you want to say,

37
00:03:11,523 --> 00:03:13,191
but you don't actually want
to do that

38
00:03:13,191 --> 00:03:14,392
and scare people off.

39
00:03:14,392 --> 00:03:15,761
You actually want to enjoy--

40
00:03:15,827 --> 00:03:18,163
have them enjoy their meal.

41
00:03:18,163 --> 00:03:20,031
There's so much stuff

42
00:03:20,065 --> 00:03:21,567
to know about wine

43
00:03:21,567 --> 00:03:23,401
and knowing
how to taste wine,

44
00:03:23,401 --> 00:03:28,206
let alone there's over 1300
identified grape varieties.

45
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:29,575
There's also different regions,

46
00:03:29,575 --> 00:03:32,210
names, places, producers.

47
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:35,447
There's hundreds and hundreds
of thousands of wines

48
00:03:35,447 --> 00:03:38,116
that come out every year.

49
00:03:38,183 --> 00:03:40,686
[woman]
I think people
who are new to wine

50
00:03:40,686 --> 00:03:42,120
somehow get the idea

51
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:45,791
that they should know
all that stuff about wine

52
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:47,726
before they can enjoy wine,

53
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:49,761
before they can talk
about wine,

54
00:03:49,761 --> 00:03:53,098
and that's really a shame.

55
00:03:53,098 --> 00:03:55,767
When I go to a restaurant
and I open up a wine list,

56
00:03:55,767 --> 00:03:57,603
it's one of the best parts
of my week

57
00:03:57,603 --> 00:03:59,037
because it's an adventure.

58
00:03:59,037 --> 00:04:02,207
I see a particular
geographical location first,

59
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,476
and then I start to think
about everything

60
00:04:04,476 --> 00:04:06,144
that went
into making that wine--

61
00:04:06,144 --> 00:04:08,146
the history, the soil.

62
00:04:08,146 --> 00:04:09,481
So for the average person,

63
00:04:09,481 --> 00:04:10,949
a wine list
is really difficult to read.

64
00:04:10,949 --> 00:04:12,818
They're not--
They're not friendly.

65
00:04:12,884 --> 00:04:14,920
You get a wine list
in your hand,

66
00:04:14,953 --> 00:04:18,156
and you look for that wine
that you know,

67
00:04:18,156 --> 00:04:20,225
and if it's not there,
what do you do?

68
00:04:20,258 --> 00:04:21,392
You know, panic sets in.

69
00:04:21,392 --> 00:04:22,828
Because there's
no descriptions.

70
00:04:22,828 --> 00:04:24,730
There's nothing there.
There's no text.

71
00:04:24,763 --> 00:04:26,798
It's just a line
with a producer,

72
00:04:26,798 --> 00:04:30,268
where it comes from,
a vintage, and a price.

73
00:04:30,301 --> 00:04:33,304
The wine list becomes a very
interesting exercise

74
00:04:33,304 --> 00:04:35,641
in social psychology

75
00:04:35,641 --> 00:04:38,644
because the sommelier,
if there is a sommelier,

76
00:04:38,644 --> 00:04:40,812
is where the people
are nervous.

77
00:04:40,846 --> 00:04:42,781
They're where the people
will be very sensitive

78
00:04:42,814 --> 00:04:44,182
to the price point.

79
00:04:44,182 --> 00:04:48,286
They have no idea
what goes with what.

80
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:50,589
[man]
And that's basically
the tricky part

81
00:04:50,589 --> 00:04:51,957
because it's intimidating.

82
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:53,491
You don't want to look stupid.

83
00:04:53,491 --> 00:04:54,826
If you're insecure
and on a table

84
00:04:54,826 --> 00:04:56,828
and open the wine list,

85
00:04:56,828 --> 00:04:58,797
your business partner
might perceive that.

86
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:01,032
Your date might see that.
And you want to look good.

87
00:05:01,032 --> 00:05:03,201
So that's kind of where
the sommelier steps in,

88
00:05:03,201 --> 00:05:04,035
which is great,

89
00:05:04,035 --> 00:05:06,638
which is why we have our jobs,

90
00:05:06,672 --> 00:05:09,875
so that you have
these lists of wines,

91
00:05:09,875 --> 00:05:11,843
and there's somebody there
that can talk you through

92
00:05:11,843 --> 00:05:13,979
what you're looking for.

93
00:05:14,012 --> 00:05:16,181
There's a lot of
great sommeliers out there,

94
00:05:16,181 --> 00:05:19,651
and what they do--
and the good ones do this--

95
00:05:19,651 --> 00:05:21,486
they make you take
a little vacation

96
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:23,889
while you're sitting
in a chair,

97
00:05:23,889 --> 00:05:25,657
and suddenly
you're being told

98
00:05:25,691 --> 00:05:28,193
about some guy
on the top of a hill

99
00:05:28,193 --> 00:05:31,697
making some crazy wine,
doing this amazing job,

100
00:05:31,697 --> 00:05:33,498
that's got, like,
really old barrels,

101
00:05:33,531 --> 00:05:34,866
and there's a dog there,

102
00:05:34,866 --> 00:05:38,203
and you're just
totally transformed.

103
00:05:38,203 --> 00:05:41,506
There is potential energy
in these bottles,

104
00:05:41,506 --> 00:05:44,743
and there are stories
to be told.

105
00:05:44,743 --> 00:05:46,845
I don't look at myself

106
00:05:46,878 --> 00:05:48,714
as a cork puller.

107
00:05:48,714 --> 00:05:51,717
I look at myself
as a storyteller.

108
00:06:06,998 --> 00:06:09,200
[McClintic]
I think there's
this great misconception

109
00:06:09,234 --> 00:06:12,370
that winemaking is this
glamorous dream job.

110
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:16,274
You know some place
where the wine is produced
that's awful?

111
00:06:16,274 --> 00:06:19,444
No. All wonderful places.

112
00:06:33,191 --> 00:06:35,927
Ugly places have never made
nice wines.

113
00:06:35,927 --> 00:06:38,864
It's not because
of ugliness and beauty--
and beautiness.

114
00:06:38,897 --> 00:06:40,966
It's about energies

115
00:06:40,966 --> 00:06:44,369
because energies build
potential of a place.

116
00:06:44,402 --> 00:06:48,907
And if the energies are good,
the place are always harmony
and beauty.

117
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:51,943
[McClintic]
Yeah, wine is grown in the most
beautiful places in the world.

118
00:06:51,943 --> 00:06:54,880
but the actual work involved--

119
00:06:54,913 --> 00:06:56,748
nothing could be further
from the truth.

120
00:06:56,782 --> 00:06:59,450
Wine is about rising
to challenges

121
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:01,720
and overcoming adversity,
and it's always just a miracle

122
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:04,255
that the stuff
actually gets made
and gets into the bottle.

123
00:07:04,289 --> 00:07:06,925
The things that
we're trying to translate

124
00:07:06,925 --> 00:07:08,760
into the glass

125
00:07:08,794 --> 00:07:11,229
are things that are
much bigger than any of us--

126
00:07:11,229 --> 00:07:13,899
the rocks, the sun,
the wind, the rain.

127
00:07:13,899 --> 00:07:16,301
Those are things
that are eternal.

128
00:07:16,301 --> 00:07:18,770
A lot of people making
their living making wine

129
00:07:18,804 --> 00:07:21,006
are everyday farmers.

130
00:07:22,674 --> 00:07:24,609
And they spend their life

131
00:07:24,642 --> 00:07:26,978
essentially controlling
this plant

132
00:07:26,978 --> 00:07:28,479
that does not want
to be controlled.

133
00:07:30,281 --> 00:07:32,784
[Meredith]
The grapevine
is a true vine,

134
00:07:32,818 --> 00:07:34,352
and if you're not growing it
on the trellis

135
00:07:34,352 --> 00:07:36,487
in a commercial vineyard
and you just let it go,

136
00:07:36,487 --> 00:07:38,289
it will climb a tree.

137
00:07:45,596 --> 00:07:47,598
Winemaking is relentless.

138
00:07:47,632 --> 00:07:49,200
You know, harvest
is going to come

139
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:52,871
when it's going to come,
and you need to be ready
for it.

140
00:07:52,938 --> 00:07:57,108
It's not just that you can
harvest these tracks of land
by yourself.

141
00:07:57,108 --> 00:07:59,110
You have to organize
groups of people,

142
00:07:59,144 --> 00:08:00,979
sometimes 20, 30, 40 people,

143
00:08:01,012 --> 00:08:03,014
and they have to be ready
on a given day

144
00:08:03,014 --> 00:08:06,517
to come together
harvesting these grapes.

145
00:08:06,517 --> 00:08:09,855
And the logistics
are mind-numbingly complex,

146
00:08:09,888 --> 00:08:11,489
and everything goes wrong,

147
00:08:11,522 --> 00:08:13,992
and that's a good harvest.

148
00:08:13,992 --> 00:08:15,660
There's over
a hundred variables

149
00:08:15,693 --> 00:08:18,396
that translate into what's
in the glass in front of you.

150
00:08:18,396 --> 00:08:20,131
Whether it's rain,

151
00:08:20,165 --> 00:08:21,366
frost,

152
00:08:21,366 --> 00:08:22,367
heat spikes,

153
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,501
drought,

154
00:08:23,534 --> 00:08:24,569
wind.

155
00:08:24,569 --> 00:08:25,904
The weather could come in.

156
00:08:25,971 --> 00:08:27,405
You could have
a tropical storm

157
00:08:27,405 --> 00:08:29,741
that's coming in
two weeks before harvest.

158
00:08:29,741 --> 00:08:32,643
You can have a good season
all year,

159
00:08:32,677 --> 00:08:34,712
but when you arrive
at a harvest

160
00:08:34,712 --> 00:08:36,047
and the weather changes,

161
00:08:36,081 --> 00:08:37,983
and you harvest
under the rain,

162
00:08:38,016 --> 00:08:40,919
the good season...
[laughs]

163
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:42,553
has nothing to say
at the end.

164
00:08:45,223 --> 00:08:47,258
[Cauble]
You don't want to harvest
right after the rain

165
00:08:47,258 --> 00:08:49,094
because the grapes
actually swell,

166
00:08:49,094 --> 00:08:51,062
actually absorbing a lot of
the water diluting the wines.

167
00:08:51,062 --> 00:08:52,730
[Kruth]
The other problem is
if the weather changes

168
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:55,566
after it rains,
you get disease pressure,
you get mold.

169
00:08:55,566 --> 00:08:58,937
You literally lose
60% of fruit to a fungus.

170
00:08:59,004 --> 00:09:00,605
It's a lot of stress.

171
00:09:00,605 --> 00:09:03,108
Come on,
what are you going to do,
not harvest the grapes?

172
00:09:03,174 --> 00:09:04,843
You have to make the wine,
you know,

173
00:09:04,843 --> 00:09:08,446
I mean, you live on that
for an entire year,

174
00:09:08,446 --> 00:09:11,216
and so when the vintage comes,
you pick it.

175
00:09:12,918 --> 00:09:14,719
[McClintic]
That's a normal vintage.

176
00:09:14,752 --> 00:09:18,589
So there's a lot of
unpredictability
with a normal vintage.

177
00:09:18,589 --> 00:09:19,858
And then there are vintages

178
00:09:19,891 --> 00:09:22,894
that are absolutely disastrous.

179
00:09:22,928 --> 00:09:25,096
[Mattiasson]
There's been plenty of wars
and hails and stuff,

180
00:09:25,096 --> 00:09:27,098
and they are brutal,

181
00:09:27,098 --> 00:09:29,600
but it's the first time
I've heard of a earthquake

182
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,768
screwing you up
during harvest.

183
00:09:30,802 --> 00:09:32,237
So at least we have

184
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:34,305
a good story to tell
the grandkids on this one.

185
00:09:41,612 --> 00:09:45,216
It was, like,
the nicest weather we've had
in I don't know how long.

186
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:47,718
Great year.
We dodged the drought bullet.

187
00:09:47,718 --> 00:09:48,920
We got spring rains,

188
00:09:48,954 --> 00:09:50,121
everything lined up perfectly.

189
00:09:50,121 --> 00:09:51,456
We had an earthquake.

190
00:09:59,097 --> 00:10:00,932
We were woken up
at 3:20 in the morning

191
00:10:00,932 --> 00:10:02,433
with the earthquake.

192
00:10:02,467 --> 00:10:05,570
Made sure the family's okay,
went outside,

193
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:08,974
turn off the gas,
all the earthquake stuff.

194
00:10:08,974 --> 00:10:11,809
And then try to--
you know, take stock
of what was going on.

195
00:10:11,843 --> 00:10:13,411
And the first thing
I'm thinking is

196
00:10:13,444 --> 00:10:16,347
I gotta find out
what's going on
with our barrels.

197
00:10:18,483 --> 00:10:20,151
All the barrels are--

198
00:10:20,185 --> 00:10:22,453
that are normally stacked up--

199
00:10:22,487 --> 00:10:24,622
are all just tossed around
in there

200
00:10:24,622 --> 00:10:27,325
like a mad giant

201
00:10:27,325 --> 00:10:29,160
just went in there and had
a temper tantrum.

202
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,196
I mean, it was just nuts.

203
00:10:34,165 --> 00:10:37,102
This happened two days ago.

204
00:10:37,102 --> 00:10:38,269
Yeah, so we're still
picking up--

205
00:10:38,303 --> 00:10:39,704
I mean,
we're literally just--

206
00:10:39,704 --> 00:10:41,306
literally picking up
the pieces

207
00:10:41,339 --> 00:10:43,774
because the pieces
are all over the ground
right now.

208
00:10:43,774 --> 00:10:45,510
Our house came off
the foundation,

209
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:47,012
and chimneys fell down

210
00:10:47,012 --> 00:10:48,846
and all a bunch of stuff
busted up.

211
00:10:48,846 --> 00:10:51,216
I mean, it's like...

212
00:10:51,282 --> 00:10:53,151
heavy, definitely heavy.

213
00:10:57,855 --> 00:11:01,792
For some reason,
even though our house
is totally screwed,

214
00:11:01,792 --> 00:11:03,461
and we probably lost
a ton of wine,

215
00:11:03,461 --> 00:11:07,832
it's kind of exciting
in a weird, masochistic way,

216
00:11:07,865 --> 00:11:10,035
like, all right,

217
00:11:10,035 --> 00:11:11,736
you know...

218
00:11:11,802 --> 00:11:13,304
[laughs]

219
00:11:13,304 --> 00:11:15,673
You know, mother nature
was creative this year.

220
00:11:15,706 --> 00:11:17,208
This was a first.

221
00:11:20,979 --> 00:11:23,314
And so the 2013's
always going to carry

222
00:11:23,314 --> 00:11:25,750
a special signifier now,

223
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:28,819
along with it, that this is
the earthquake vintage

224
00:11:28,853 --> 00:11:30,188
and there wasn't
as much of it

225
00:11:30,221 --> 00:11:32,690
for the producers
that lost wine,

226
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:35,693
and I think it's going to be
a pretty neat little legacy,

227
00:11:35,693 --> 00:11:37,362
this vintage going forward.

228
00:11:37,395 --> 00:11:39,998
Now this vintage
is always going to be marked
in that way.

229
00:11:39,998 --> 00:11:43,701
I think it's pretty cool.

230
00:11:43,734 --> 00:11:45,570
[McClintic]
When you're talking
about a vintage,

231
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:48,539
you're really talking
about weather,

232
00:11:48,539 --> 00:11:51,242
and weather, unlike climate,
is completely variable.

233
00:11:51,242 --> 00:11:53,178
There are very few vintages

234
00:11:53,211 --> 00:11:55,180
that a winemaker deals with

235
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:57,015
that are problem free,

236
00:11:57,015 --> 00:11:58,849
maybe like one every 10 years

237
00:11:58,883 --> 00:12:00,285
you get that magical vintage.

238
00:12:09,927 --> 00:12:12,063
The reality about vintages

239
00:12:12,063 --> 00:12:14,299
is it's variable.

240
00:12:14,299 --> 00:12:16,301
Every year is different,

241
00:12:16,367 --> 00:12:18,369
but a great wine,
a great vintage,

242
00:12:18,369 --> 00:12:20,238
will age very, very long.

243
00:12:20,271 --> 00:12:22,773
[man]
Wine is living, and so wine
is always evolving.

244
00:12:22,773 --> 00:12:25,210
Wine is never static.

245
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:29,981
[McClintic]
Wine wants to become vinegar,
right?

246
00:12:29,981 --> 00:12:33,784
And if you could catch it
in the right place on its arc,

247
00:12:33,784 --> 00:12:35,886
and it's 40 or 50 years deep,

248
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,123
you've got
the craziest flavors

249
00:12:38,123 --> 00:12:40,758
that you never tasted before.

250
00:12:40,791 --> 00:12:42,393
Wines with age

251
00:12:42,393 --> 00:12:45,230
are probably the dream
the winemaker had

252
00:12:45,263 --> 00:12:47,465
when he or she made it.

253
00:12:47,465 --> 00:12:51,402
And we have the chance
to drink in the moment

254
00:12:51,436 --> 00:12:54,839
where that dream is realized.

255
00:12:54,839 --> 00:12:56,507
We got an '88 Muscadet.

256
00:12:56,507 --> 00:12:59,610
This is a bottle
that probably costs
about $15 now,

257
00:12:59,644 --> 00:13:00,845
for a new retail bottle,

258
00:13:00,845 --> 00:13:02,747
this was probably
three or four dollars maybe

259
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:04,782
when this bottle was bought.

260
00:13:04,782 --> 00:13:07,785
Doesn't have to be expensive.
It just has to be
the right bottle of wine

261
00:13:07,785 --> 00:13:10,355
stored the right way,
opened at the right time.

262
00:13:10,355 --> 00:13:12,290
Some of the most expensive wine
in the world

263
00:13:12,323 --> 00:13:14,659
are crazy old bottles because
there's just less of them,

264
00:13:14,659 --> 00:13:17,962
and everyone wants to drink them
in their peak.

265
00:13:17,995 --> 00:13:19,264
I love old wine.

266
00:13:19,264 --> 00:13:22,100
I mean, I love old Napa cav.

267
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,701
I love old Barolo.

268
00:13:23,701 --> 00:13:25,103
I love old chardonnay.

269
00:13:25,136 --> 00:13:26,637
I mean, I think aged wine

270
00:13:26,671 --> 00:13:28,539
is just
a really beautiful thing.

271
00:13:28,539 --> 00:13:31,476
I generally don't like
most old wine

272
00:13:31,509 --> 00:13:35,213
because wine has to be
stored perfectly.

273
00:13:35,213 --> 00:13:37,282
Some people might think
old wine is always good.

274
00:13:37,315 --> 00:13:38,516
That's not correct.

275
00:13:38,516 --> 00:13:40,318
Some wines
should be drunk young.

276
00:13:40,351 --> 00:13:41,852
And that's just
the reality of it.

277
00:13:41,852 --> 00:13:43,788
But when you get that,
like, magical bottle,

278
00:13:43,788 --> 00:13:46,557
that's been stored perfectly
for 20 or 30 years

279
00:13:46,557 --> 00:13:49,227
and it was meant to be,
you know, it gives you
an experience

280
00:13:49,227 --> 00:13:51,662
that a young bottle of wine
can't give you.

281
00:13:51,696 --> 00:13:53,831
[McClintic]
Wine does not like heat,

282
00:13:53,831 --> 00:13:56,134
and it doesn't like light.

283
00:13:56,134 --> 00:13:58,636
Wine being stored
in your back seat,

284
00:13:58,636 --> 00:14:00,571
you know, in the Vegas sun
for 20 minutes

285
00:14:00,571 --> 00:14:02,207
will completely ruin
a bottle of wine.

286
00:14:02,207 --> 00:14:03,974
There's no better wine

287
00:14:04,008 --> 00:14:05,676
than a wine you have
at the Domaine.

288
00:14:22,593 --> 00:14:25,163
For me that's a huge part
of the personality
of the house,

289
00:14:25,196 --> 00:14:26,597
is what's going on
in the cellar.

290
00:14:26,597 --> 00:14:30,268
The cellar is
a very important private place

291
00:14:30,335 --> 00:14:33,404
because this is where
the wine rests.

292
00:14:33,404 --> 00:14:36,207
This is where the wines
will change.

293
00:14:36,241 --> 00:14:38,543
This is where you keep
your old bottles of wine,

294
00:14:38,543 --> 00:14:42,012
and that's actually where you
spend all of the time.

295
00:14:42,012 --> 00:14:44,782
There's a sense in the cellar

296
00:14:44,782 --> 00:14:50,888
that man takes the process
of growing wine to a point,

297
00:14:50,921 --> 00:14:55,726
and that point involves
the moment when the cork goes
in the bottle.

298
00:15:03,534 --> 00:15:05,136
You walk into these cellars,

299
00:15:05,136 --> 00:15:07,305
and they're very deep
beneath the earth.

300
00:15:07,372 --> 00:15:12,076
You're-- typically you
walk down sometimes three or
four or five flights of stairs,

301
00:15:12,109 --> 00:15:15,613
and you come
into this very dark space.

302
00:15:15,613 --> 00:15:19,150
We have to duck because
the ceiling's a little low,

303
00:15:19,217 --> 00:15:21,552
and you can't really see
very well.

304
00:15:21,586 --> 00:15:22,987
And you get to the bottom,

305
00:15:22,987 --> 00:15:25,323
and there's mold everywhere.

306
00:15:27,124 --> 00:15:31,462
The cellar
is a whole microclimate,

307
00:15:31,462 --> 00:15:34,098
I will say,
with the right temperature,

308
00:15:34,098 --> 00:15:36,567
the right humidity.

309
00:15:36,567 --> 00:15:38,102
[man]
The best storage
you can think of,

310
00:15:38,135 --> 00:15:41,939
you know, it's always
about 55 Fahrenheit, 11 Celsius

311
00:15:41,939 --> 00:15:44,242
during the winter
or during the summer.

312
00:15:44,242 --> 00:15:46,277
You have the vapor
from the wine

313
00:15:46,311 --> 00:15:47,645
for the bottles,

314
00:15:47,645 --> 00:15:51,148
so this create
a special environment.

315
00:15:51,148 --> 00:15:52,650
[Cauble]
You smell the cellar.

316
00:15:52,683 --> 00:15:54,352
It almost smells
like the personality

317
00:15:54,352 --> 00:15:55,686
of the wine.

318
00:15:55,753 --> 00:15:57,588
It just smells
kind of like a wet,

319
00:15:57,588 --> 00:16:00,758
kind of rock, or almost like
a bag of mushrooms.

320
00:16:00,758 --> 00:16:02,427
And you may have seen some,
you know,

321
00:16:02,427 --> 00:16:05,363
like mushrooms growing
on the bottles,

322
00:16:05,363 --> 00:16:07,365
but even on some of the corks.

323
00:16:10,935 --> 00:16:13,304
It has no effect
on the quality of the wine,

324
00:16:13,338 --> 00:16:15,105
but it looks pretty amazing.

325
00:16:21,779 --> 00:16:25,483
[Chave]
Then you have
this fungus growing,

326
00:16:25,516 --> 00:16:27,017
and this is totally alive.

327
00:16:28,686 --> 00:16:31,989
Yeah, the Latin name
is Aspergillus niger,

328
00:16:32,022 --> 00:16:33,691
the black cellar mold.

329
00:16:33,691 --> 00:16:36,294
And we take care
of this fungus.

330
00:16:36,294 --> 00:16:39,196
It's living from alcohol
being in the air,

331
00:16:39,196 --> 00:16:41,799
and it's keeping
the air fresh,

332
00:16:41,832 --> 00:16:45,836
and that's something
we are very proud of.

333
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:50,007
It will change according
to the time, the year.

334
00:16:50,007 --> 00:16:53,344
It's going to turn white,
and then it's going to be
all black.

335
00:16:53,344 --> 00:16:55,713
That's a sign
of a very good cellar.

336
00:16:58,549 --> 00:17:02,052
They treat this fungus
like their little pet.

337
00:17:02,052 --> 00:17:03,588
And literally they pet it.

338
00:17:03,654 --> 00:17:06,524
You can touch it.
It's like a black cotton ball.

339
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,529
You know
these producers' wines,

340
00:17:11,562 --> 00:17:14,565
and you're like,
"Wow, this is why this wine
smells like what it does."

341
00:17:14,565 --> 00:17:16,233
It's not just the grapes
and the soil

342
00:17:16,233 --> 00:17:18,235
and the yeast
that fermented it.

343
00:17:18,235 --> 00:17:21,506
It's actually where
it was aged in all of these
different funguses.

344
00:17:26,444 --> 00:17:29,947
You have the sense
in a classic old cellar

345
00:17:30,014 --> 00:17:32,116
that that winemaker

346
00:17:32,116 --> 00:17:34,184
has taken that bottle

347
00:17:34,218 --> 00:17:36,721
and given it to time.

348
00:17:47,865 --> 00:17:52,036
Every single bottle has
a date printed on the label,
typically,

349
00:17:52,036 --> 00:17:53,938
and that date tells a story

350
00:17:53,938 --> 00:17:56,240
about what happened
in that given year.

351
00:17:56,273 --> 00:17:57,942
There are very few bottles
that don't,

352
00:17:57,942 --> 00:18:01,111
and one of the exceptions
would probably be champagne.

353
00:18:01,145 --> 00:18:03,981
So with champagne,
the weather is so bad there

354
00:18:04,048 --> 00:18:07,151
that it's only
very, very special vintages

355
00:18:07,151 --> 00:18:08,453
where the weather was perfect,

356
00:18:08,453 --> 00:18:10,388
that they actually declare
a vintage.

357
00:18:10,421 --> 00:18:13,391
They typically blend
the wine from multiple
vintages together

358
00:18:13,391 --> 00:18:17,628
so that way you have
an even expression of champagne
every single year.

359
00:18:17,628 --> 00:18:19,764
When you're going to bottle
a vintage champagne,

360
00:18:19,797 --> 00:18:22,500
that means it's a story you
actually want to tell
on its own.

361
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:26,737
1969, Dom Ruinart.
It's a rare bottle.

362
00:18:26,771 --> 00:18:30,441
We have 19 left in the cellar,

363
00:18:30,475 --> 00:18:33,077
so this would be
18 after today,

364
00:18:33,077 --> 00:18:37,081
and there's probably
less than 15 in the world,
I would say.

365
00:18:59,169 --> 00:19:00,137
Ah.

366
00:19:03,173 --> 00:19:04,709
The color is...

367
00:19:04,709 --> 00:19:06,377
As you can see,
it's pretty gold,

368
00:19:06,377 --> 00:19:10,881
which is something you expect
for a 45-year-old champagne.

369
00:19:10,881 --> 00:19:12,850
[Dame]
White wines, as they age,
develop color,

370
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:15,185
and red wines, as they age,
lose color.

371
00:19:15,185 --> 00:19:16,854
So there's the pigmentation.

372
00:19:16,854 --> 00:19:19,123
[McClintic]
As it goes, those fruit
elements start to fade,

373
00:19:19,156 --> 00:19:22,226
and these beautiful secondary
characteristics take over.

374
00:19:22,226 --> 00:19:23,561
Earthy characteristics--

375
00:19:23,628 --> 00:19:26,464
flowers, herbs, spices.

376
00:19:26,464 --> 00:19:28,399
[Dame]
They develop
that slightly nutty--

377
00:19:28,399 --> 00:19:30,200
the oxidated quality.

378
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,703
There's still a great acidity,

379
00:19:32,703 --> 00:19:34,539
some effervescence,
not too strong,

380
00:19:34,539 --> 00:19:36,707
but as you can expect,
with such an old champagne.

381
00:19:36,741 --> 00:19:40,244
All of that baby fat
sheds away.

382
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:44,314
[Dame]
And it becomes more
of a whole than pieces.

383
00:19:44,314 --> 00:19:46,150
It's very intensely perfumed.

384
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:48,419
It's this snapshot.
It's this piece of history,

385
00:19:48,419 --> 00:19:49,854
it's bottled history,

386
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:51,989
of what happened
to those grapes in that year.

387
00:19:51,989 --> 00:19:56,093
You can taste the warmth
of the '69 vintage,

388
00:19:56,093 --> 00:19:58,996
which was-- which was actually
a very warm vintage,

389
00:19:59,029 --> 00:20:01,231
a lot of sunshine,
great harvest,

390
00:20:01,231 --> 00:20:02,500
very healthy grapes.

391
00:20:02,533 --> 00:20:04,168
And it's tend to show,
I think,

392
00:20:04,168 --> 00:20:07,337
that dried apricots,

393
00:20:07,371 --> 00:20:09,874
dried pineapple
sort of flavors.

394
00:20:09,874 --> 00:20:12,376
It's really the sign
of a warm year.

395
00:20:12,376 --> 00:20:14,378
[swishes]

396
00:20:14,411 --> 00:20:15,946
Drinking history.

397
00:20:18,382 --> 00:20:19,917
It's good. Shit.

398
00:20:51,448 --> 00:20:53,784
[tower bell ringing]

399
00:21:32,657 --> 00:21:37,127
Our archives
keep a lot of secrets.

400
00:21:37,161 --> 00:21:40,164
Grapes have been here
since Roman soldiers

401
00:21:40,164 --> 00:21:43,033
covered Germany
in the first century.

402
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,869
The first documents
about winemaking

403
00:21:44,869 --> 00:21:47,638
dates back to the year 700.

404
00:21:47,672 --> 00:21:50,374
This is the invoice book

405
00:21:50,374 --> 00:21:54,545
from the year 1492.

406
00:21:54,612 --> 00:21:58,115
They really documented
all single details

407
00:21:58,148 --> 00:21:59,617
of what they sold,

408
00:21:59,617 --> 00:22:01,285
when they sold the wine,

409
00:22:01,285 --> 00:22:03,287
and who were the customers.

410
00:22:03,287 --> 00:22:06,991
For me, I think, like,
goosebumps are running
down my neck

411
00:22:07,024 --> 00:22:11,796
when I hold this
little booklet in my hand,

412
00:22:11,796 --> 00:22:16,701
and it is as old as when
Columbus discovered America.

413
00:22:16,701 --> 00:22:19,369
History gives wine

414
00:22:19,369 --> 00:22:21,238
heart and soul.

415
00:22:23,373 --> 00:22:24,875
I really didn't like history

416
00:22:24,875 --> 00:22:29,213
until I got interested
in wine grapes

417
00:22:29,246 --> 00:22:30,748
and realized

418
00:22:30,748 --> 00:22:32,883
that the history of wine

419
00:22:32,883 --> 00:22:34,752
is the history of Europe.

420
00:22:34,819 --> 00:22:37,688
I don't think sommeliers
gravitate towards great wines
of the world

421
00:22:37,722 --> 00:22:39,356
because of history.

422
00:22:39,356 --> 00:22:45,696
I think history naturally forges
the great wines of the world.

423
00:22:45,696 --> 00:22:48,699
From the beginning
of our story

424
00:22:48,733 --> 00:22:50,400
wine has been there.

425
00:22:54,071 --> 00:22:57,541
[Meredith]
If we go back thousands
and thousands of years,

426
00:22:57,574 --> 00:23:00,444
the very first
cultivated grapevines

427
00:23:00,444 --> 00:23:02,947
were just sticks that people
stuck in the ground

428
00:23:02,947 --> 00:23:05,215
from vines that they found
in the forest.

429
00:23:07,251 --> 00:23:10,254
There's a lot of evidence
this happened in Spain

430
00:23:10,287 --> 00:23:12,222
and in the northern coast
of Africa

431
00:23:12,256 --> 00:23:15,592
and in other parts
of the Mediterranean coast
of Europe.

432
00:23:15,592 --> 00:23:17,928
Certainly the Phoenicians

433
00:23:17,928 --> 00:23:20,865
began to explore
the Mediterranean,

434
00:23:20,898 --> 00:23:22,867
and we know
that they brought wine.

435
00:23:22,867 --> 00:23:24,769
The same thing happened
with the Greeks,

436
00:23:24,769 --> 00:23:27,037
we know that the Greeks
took grapevines.

437
00:23:27,071 --> 00:23:29,874
We know that the Romans
did the same thing.

438
00:23:32,943 --> 00:23:34,712
[Grieco]
I want to go back to Rome, man.

439
00:23:34,712 --> 00:23:36,080
I want to go back
to the Coliseum.

440
00:23:36,113 --> 00:23:37,547
I want to sit there
in the sands.

441
00:23:37,547 --> 00:23:39,216
I want to see
a gladiator fight.

442
00:23:39,249 --> 00:23:42,720
I want to eat a corndog
and a big flask
of goddamn grape juice

443
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,054
from the Romans.

444
00:23:44,054 --> 00:23:45,923
The Romans drank
with a vigor

445
00:23:45,956 --> 00:23:49,126
that I would love to have
more of in my life.

446
00:23:49,126 --> 00:23:50,828
[Hepp]
Caesar told his troops

447
00:23:50,895 --> 00:23:56,333
to drink at least one
to 1 1/2 liter per wine a day

448
00:23:56,333 --> 00:23:58,736
because he knew that wine

449
00:23:58,769 --> 00:24:00,237
keeps the troops healthy,

450
00:24:00,237 --> 00:24:05,442
and Caesar doubled the quantity
from 1.5 to 3 liters

451
00:24:05,475 --> 00:24:08,112
when his troops
needed to fight.

452
00:24:08,112 --> 00:24:10,580
So I think this was
the start of doping,

453
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:11,816
when the Roman soldiers

454
00:24:11,816 --> 00:24:13,984
went into battle

455
00:24:14,018 --> 00:24:16,453
after having a couple
of liters of wine.

456
00:24:16,486 --> 00:24:18,155
And the wine they drink

457
00:24:18,155 --> 00:24:20,791
we nowadays call "golden wine."

458
00:24:20,825 --> 00:24:22,659
It's not white.
It's not red.

459
00:24:22,659 --> 00:24:24,361
It's a combination
of all the grapes

460
00:24:24,428 --> 00:24:26,263
being harvested together.

461
00:24:27,932 --> 00:24:30,100
It has got
religious significance.

462
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:31,769
When Jesus changed water
into wine,

463
00:24:31,769 --> 00:24:33,170
it was probably a good start

464
00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:34,839
because there must've been
something there.

465
00:24:34,839 --> 00:24:37,474
When they served it
at the last supper,

466
00:24:37,507 --> 00:24:39,543
well, you know,
must've been a good vintage.

467
00:24:39,543 --> 00:24:40,945
But lest we forget,

468
00:24:40,978 --> 00:24:43,547
when Noah and his ark
landed on Mount Ararat

469
00:24:43,547 --> 00:24:45,615
in the Caucasus Mountains

470
00:24:45,649 --> 00:24:47,985
of what is now Turkey,

471
00:24:48,018 --> 00:24:49,053
first thing he did,

472
00:24:49,053 --> 00:24:50,988
the very first thing,

473
00:24:51,021 --> 00:24:53,357
was to plant a vine,
grow grapes,

474
00:24:53,357 --> 00:24:54,524
make wine,

475
00:24:54,524 --> 00:24:59,029
and get drunk and pass out
naked in his tent.

476
00:24:59,063 --> 00:25:01,231
It's a spiritual beverage.

477
00:25:01,231 --> 00:25:03,834
It's what-- literally
spirit in the sense
that it's alcoholic.

478
00:25:03,868 --> 00:25:07,304
It's ecstatic in the sense
it has the potential,

479
00:25:07,304 --> 00:25:08,839
taken in excess,

480
00:25:08,873 --> 00:25:11,375
to take you out of yourself,

481
00:25:11,375 --> 00:25:15,245
which is a quasi-religious
experience.

482
00:25:15,312 --> 00:25:18,182
Is that the reason
why it becomes a sacrament,

483
00:25:18,215 --> 00:25:20,918
why it becomes Christ's blood?

484
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:24,922
Probably.

485
00:25:28,025 --> 00:25:30,861
Really, the roots,
in my mind,

486
00:25:30,861 --> 00:25:32,729
of roles of wine we know today

487
00:25:32,729 --> 00:25:35,732
came really from the monks.

488
00:25:35,766 --> 00:25:38,435
[Grieco]
They spent all day, every day,

489
00:25:38,435 --> 00:25:39,703
out in the vineyards

490
00:25:39,736 --> 00:25:41,671
working the soil,
working the vines,

491
00:25:41,671 --> 00:25:44,008
and, most importantly,

492
00:25:44,008 --> 00:25:46,243
documenting what they did,

493
00:25:46,243 --> 00:25:49,079
so quite a few of the great
wine areas of Europe,

494
00:25:49,079 --> 00:25:51,281
we know exactly what they did
and when they did it

495
00:25:51,348 --> 00:25:54,384
because of
these religious orders.

496
00:25:56,020 --> 00:26:00,190
In France, this happened
over centuries,

497
00:26:00,224 --> 00:26:01,725
and it happened at a time

498
00:26:01,758 --> 00:26:05,595
without economic pressure
at all.

499
00:26:15,272 --> 00:26:18,809
Ultimately in Europe,
history is revered.

500
00:26:18,876 --> 00:26:20,077
It's part and parcel

501
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:21,812
of what they do every day.

502
00:26:21,812 --> 00:26:23,147
They walk through the streets,

503
00:26:23,147 --> 00:26:25,615
and it's there
in front of them.

504
00:26:25,615 --> 00:26:26,951
Most European winemakers now,

505
00:26:26,951 --> 00:26:29,119
many of them
have been handed

506
00:26:29,153 --> 00:26:31,255
properties and vineyards
and chateaus

507
00:26:31,288 --> 00:26:33,290
from their parents,
grandparents,

508
00:26:33,290 --> 00:26:36,927
great grandparents,
sometimes 13, 16 generations,

509
00:26:36,961 --> 00:26:39,897
and they have no cost of land.

510
00:26:39,897 --> 00:26:41,498
They have the vineyard.

511
00:26:41,498 --> 00:26:43,167
It's their job
to take care of them,

512
00:26:43,167 --> 00:26:45,002
their job to make the wine.

513
00:26:48,438 --> 00:26:51,641
You know,
my family has been always
in the wine business.

514
00:26:51,641 --> 00:26:52,943
As it happens often,

515
00:26:52,977 --> 00:26:54,144
in Italy or in Barolo,

516
00:26:54,144 --> 00:26:56,013
my father took over
his father,

517
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,915
which took over his father,
which took over his papa.

518
00:26:57,915 --> 00:27:01,185
We go back almost 200 years.

519
00:27:01,185 --> 00:27:04,288
Well, I'm-- I think--
I'm the seventh generation.

520
00:27:04,321 --> 00:27:07,024
My daughter is now
11th generation.

521
00:27:07,024 --> 00:27:09,359
In Hermitage
I'm the 16th generation,

522
00:27:09,426 --> 00:27:13,430
and so we know exactly the wine
I'm making in Hermitage,

523
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:16,934
I'm making from vines
that were planted by my father,

524
00:27:16,934 --> 00:27:19,169
my grandfather,
my great grandfather,

525
00:27:19,169 --> 00:27:21,705
so we know them so well.

526
00:27:26,343 --> 00:27:28,278
[Parr]
There's so much history
at Hermitage, you know?

527
00:27:28,312 --> 00:27:30,514
Think, going back in 400 BC,

528
00:27:30,514 --> 00:27:32,883
when the Romans
planted vineyards there,

529
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:36,853
and to think about today,
there are still
vineyards there.

530
00:27:36,853 --> 00:27:39,223
It's still called Hermitage.

531
00:27:39,289 --> 00:27:41,391
They still have Syrah.
It's kind of mind boggling.

532
00:27:44,895 --> 00:27:47,531
The legend of Hermitage
goes like this.

533
00:27:47,531 --> 00:27:48,865
There's this knight,

534
00:27:48,899 --> 00:27:50,167
who fought in the Crusades,

535
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:53,370
and this guy is a war hero.

536
00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:55,405
This knight
comes back injured.

537
00:27:55,472 --> 00:28:00,010
And as a reward,
the queen of France
allows him to recover

538
00:28:00,044 --> 00:28:03,147
and heal his wounds
on top of this hill.

539
00:28:03,147 --> 00:28:04,748
And he never leaves.

540
00:28:04,748 --> 00:28:06,250
And the villagers down there

541
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:07,584
know that he's up there,

542
00:28:07,584 --> 00:28:08,919
this legendary war hero,

543
00:28:08,986 --> 00:28:10,887
and they started calling him
the hermit.

544
00:28:10,887 --> 00:28:14,024
And that's how Hermitage
got its name.

545
00:28:17,027 --> 00:28:18,495
If you get
on this journey of wine,

546
00:28:18,495 --> 00:28:20,830
and you kind of get bitten
by the wine bug,

547
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:22,199
and you fall in love with it,

548
00:28:22,232 --> 00:28:25,335
you end up having epiphanies
along the way.

549
00:28:25,335 --> 00:28:31,441
One of those bottles
happened to be
a 1990 Chave Hermitage.

550
00:28:31,441 --> 00:28:34,078
I didn't know Syrah
could taste like that--

551
00:28:34,078 --> 00:28:35,879
smoked meat, pepper,

552
00:28:35,912 --> 00:28:37,747
Provençal herbs,

553
00:28:37,747 --> 00:28:39,183
violets,

554
00:28:39,183 --> 00:28:40,850
blackberry, blueberry,

555
00:28:40,884 --> 00:28:42,186
granite.

556
00:28:42,186 --> 00:28:44,554
I fell in love
with Syrah that day,

557
00:28:44,588 --> 00:28:46,523
and it was a bottle
of Chave Hermitage.

558
00:28:46,523 --> 00:28:49,193
Jean-Louis Chave--
he is the wine.

559
00:28:49,226 --> 00:28:52,963
He lives on the hill
of Hermitage.

560
00:28:52,963 --> 00:28:54,264
This is the hermit.

561
00:28:54,264 --> 00:28:56,600
This is the hermit
on Hermitage today.

562
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:57,934
He is on that hill,

563
00:28:57,934 --> 00:29:03,140
and he is connected
to his little plot.

564
00:29:05,075 --> 00:29:08,412
If I had to pick
one epiphany wine,

565
00:29:08,412 --> 00:29:13,217
one wine which made me say,
"This is it,"

566
00:29:13,217 --> 00:29:17,221
it's 1969 Chave Hermitage.

567
00:29:17,221 --> 00:29:22,926
So I'm gonna open
a bottle of Hermitage, 1969.

568
00:29:22,959 --> 00:29:25,229
It's an important wine for me

569
00:29:25,229 --> 00:29:28,265
because I was born in 1968,

570
00:29:28,298 --> 00:29:30,467
which was a catastrophe
for wine,

571
00:29:30,467 --> 00:29:34,904
so they haven't even bottled
a single bottle of '68,

572
00:29:34,904 --> 00:29:38,242
so my dad saved for me,

573
00:29:38,242 --> 00:29:40,810
a '69 red Hermitage.

574
00:29:44,481 --> 00:29:46,483
Old bottles are very important

575
00:29:46,516 --> 00:29:50,420
because of the memory
of the Domaine.

576
00:29:50,454 --> 00:29:52,656
It's like your old books.

577
00:29:55,125 --> 00:29:57,827
Once you drink it,
it's gone forever,

578
00:29:57,827 --> 00:30:01,031
but before being drunk,
like when you touch a bottle,

579
00:30:01,098 --> 00:30:03,300
it's a reality.

580
00:30:04,934 --> 00:30:06,470
And then you drink the wine,

581
00:30:06,503 --> 00:30:08,172
and then the wines
will be gone.

582
00:30:08,172 --> 00:30:09,973
It will be in your memory.

583
00:30:10,006 --> 00:30:12,342
His history goes so far back.

584
00:30:12,342 --> 00:30:14,211
The Chave family
has been there so long.

585
00:30:14,211 --> 00:30:17,647
The same family,
who's owned it since 1481...

586
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:26,390
[Chave]
This wine was made
by my grandfather

587
00:30:26,456 --> 00:30:29,793
when my father started
to work with him.

588
00:30:29,826 --> 00:30:33,297
Maybe they were sharing
some experience with my dad

589
00:30:33,297 --> 00:30:36,633
that decided on that blend.

590
00:30:36,633 --> 00:30:38,635
It's a piece of history
for us.

591
00:30:46,476 --> 00:30:48,312
Yeah, the color is perfect.

592
00:30:53,049 --> 00:30:55,352
Yeah, it's a very good bottle,
actually.

593
00:31:02,726 --> 00:31:06,563
This whole philosophy
is like people come and go,

594
00:31:06,563 --> 00:31:09,099
but the vineyard
is still around,

595
00:31:09,166 --> 00:31:12,202
and wine can age
for a very long time, actually.

596
00:31:14,104 --> 00:31:16,039
When we open a bottle,
we taste it,

597
00:31:16,072 --> 00:31:19,509
we go back to everything
what happened

598
00:31:19,509 --> 00:31:23,280
from now all the way
to back then,

599
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:26,616
the link between generation.

600
00:31:28,718 --> 00:31:31,421
It reminds them
of a time and a place...

601
00:31:32,889 --> 00:31:35,091
and work that was done
with specific people

602
00:31:35,091 --> 00:31:37,093
in specific times.
You know?

603
00:31:37,127 --> 00:31:41,030
And it's like you almost see
their life flashing
before their eyes

604
00:31:41,064 --> 00:31:42,899
in that one bottle of wine.

605
00:31:57,447 --> 00:31:59,416
[Grieco]
How I define greatness in wine

606
00:31:59,449 --> 00:32:01,084
is that great wine--

607
00:32:01,084 --> 00:32:02,286
this applies across
the board--

608
00:32:02,286 --> 00:32:04,721
must have a sense of balance,

609
00:32:04,754 --> 00:32:05,755
complexity,

610
00:32:05,789 --> 00:32:07,157
delicacy,

611
00:32:07,157 --> 00:32:09,459
sense of place,
a.k.a. terroir,

612
00:32:09,459 --> 00:32:12,662
ability to age,
and yumminess.

613
00:32:12,729 --> 00:32:15,932
And I look
at those six criteria,
and I say, "Holy shit.

614
00:32:15,965 --> 00:32:19,636
"Riesling exceeds all
expectations in these six areas.

615
00:32:19,636 --> 00:32:22,439
Why can't other people
see this?"

616
00:32:22,439 --> 00:32:25,108
Somms have a love affair
with Riesling

617
00:32:25,108 --> 00:32:27,477
because it's crisp,

618
00:32:27,477 --> 00:32:29,913
it's high acid,
it's mineral,

619
00:32:29,946 --> 00:32:32,649
and when you taste as much wine
as sommeliers taste,

620
00:32:32,649 --> 00:32:35,619
you end up craving wines that
don't fatigue your palate.

621
00:32:35,652 --> 00:32:38,488
You crave wines
that refresh your palate.

622
00:32:38,488 --> 00:32:39,489
The biggest misconception,

623
00:32:39,523 --> 00:32:41,358
probably, with the public,

624
00:32:41,425 --> 00:32:43,993
is that somehow Riesling
is going to be sweet,

625
00:32:43,993 --> 00:32:47,331
and, yes, there are a ton
of delicious sweet examples,

626
00:32:47,331 --> 00:32:51,468
but there's also
some amazing, bone-dry Riesling

627
00:32:51,501 --> 00:32:53,370
that is not sweet at all,

628
00:32:53,370 --> 00:32:55,272
and when that gets served
to someone

629
00:32:55,305 --> 00:32:58,542
who I know
doesn't like Riesling,

630
00:32:58,542 --> 00:33:00,377
they go,
"Wow, this is Riesling?"

631
00:33:00,444 --> 00:33:03,380
I'm like,
"Yeah, it's Riesling."

632
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:04,848
Most of the great Rieslings
of the world

633
00:33:04,848 --> 00:33:08,218
are grown in slate soils,
particularly in Germany,

634
00:33:08,285 --> 00:33:10,220
but there's some
incredible examples

635
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:11,321
coming from Austria

636
00:33:11,355 --> 00:33:13,390
and Alsace as well.

637
00:33:13,390 --> 00:33:16,560
If you look
at where Riesling is grown,

638
00:33:16,626 --> 00:33:19,296
and then you think
about World War II

639
00:33:19,296 --> 00:33:20,897
and World War I,

640
00:33:20,897 --> 00:33:24,334
and how is Germany
gonna occupy France,

641
00:33:24,368 --> 00:33:28,037
it's literally right
through that narrow corridor

642
00:33:28,037 --> 00:33:29,573
that is Riesling Mecca.

643
00:33:32,008 --> 00:33:33,343
The two last wars,

644
00:33:33,377 --> 00:33:37,080
World War II and World War I,
of course,

645
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:39,082
were quite devastating.

646
00:33:41,017 --> 00:33:43,353
Most of the vineyards
have been destroyed.

647
00:33:43,387 --> 00:33:46,390
Most of the winemakers died,

648
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:49,859
so nobody was left
to do the hard work
in the steep vineyards.

649
00:34:11,715 --> 00:34:13,216
[Hepp]
There were big parties
going on

650
00:34:13,249 --> 00:34:14,384
after World War II,

651
00:34:14,384 --> 00:34:16,185
from soldiers also,

652
00:34:16,185 --> 00:34:18,522
so they drank
and they enjoyed

653
00:34:18,555 --> 00:34:19,956
all these famous vintages.

654
00:34:19,956 --> 00:34:21,891
I mean, somebody comes
invading your country,

655
00:34:21,925 --> 00:34:24,193
and they drink up
most of your inventory
you can't hide.

656
00:34:24,193 --> 00:34:26,863
Don't see a lot of
'37s and '38s around, do you?

657
00:34:26,896 --> 00:34:28,898
'39s?

658
00:34:31,935 --> 00:34:37,273
The winery is now more
than 270 years in family,

659
00:34:37,273 --> 00:34:39,609
but that's not
our original building.

660
00:34:39,643 --> 00:34:41,311
We lost it
in the Second World War,

661
00:34:41,378 --> 00:34:43,447
by bombs.

662
00:34:43,447 --> 00:34:46,983
They've adapted
in that way.

663
00:34:47,050 --> 00:34:47,917
I mean, they're used to it.

664
00:34:49,953 --> 00:34:53,256
Look at Champagne.
I mean, the whole World War I,

665
00:34:53,289 --> 00:34:54,824
the trench war--
the most horrific

666
00:34:54,824 --> 00:34:57,994
blood-to-nose battle to battle
in history,

667
00:34:57,994 --> 00:34:59,663
and at the end of the war
was what?

668
00:34:59,729 --> 00:35:01,798
Trenches, rats,
and dead bodies. Right?

669
00:35:01,798 --> 00:35:04,000
And look where Champagne
is today.

670
00:35:04,067 --> 00:35:06,970
Planted out with the most
expensive wines in the world,

671
00:35:06,970 --> 00:35:09,639
and the quality's
never been better.

672
00:35:09,673 --> 00:35:11,841
Our cellars were raided
during the Second World War,

673
00:35:11,841 --> 00:35:15,445
so we don't have anything
prior to mid-40s.

674
00:35:17,747 --> 00:35:22,752
The German came
and they took over, actually,
this house.

675
00:35:22,786 --> 00:35:24,788
My great grandfather
and grandfather

676
00:35:24,788 --> 00:35:29,826
were smart to hide this cellar.

677
00:35:29,826 --> 00:35:32,161
That's why we still have
these old bottles of wine.

678
00:35:33,863 --> 00:35:35,799
If you've been
to some of these wineries,

679
00:35:35,832 --> 00:35:37,867
you see
all that history unfold.

680
00:35:37,867 --> 00:35:40,637
You can't help but have
a visual association

681
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:42,706
with that grape and that place

682
00:35:42,706 --> 00:35:44,207
and what people went through.

683
00:35:44,273 --> 00:35:47,677
I think it makes
the great Riesling,

684
00:35:47,677 --> 00:35:51,014
and it makes the region
that much more enriching.

685
00:35:52,849 --> 00:35:55,619
I love these places
in the world for food or wine

686
00:35:55,652 --> 00:35:57,186
where cultures clash,

687
00:35:57,186 --> 00:36:01,224
and nothing pushes
evolution more than conflict

688
00:36:01,290 --> 00:36:02,492
and struggle.

689
00:36:02,526 --> 00:36:05,028
And it forces the people
to evolve,

690
00:36:05,028 --> 00:36:08,031
the food to evolve,
the wine to evolve.

691
00:36:08,031 --> 00:36:12,035
And to me it's where
a lot of the best wine
and food is made.

692
00:36:13,369 --> 00:36:15,138
Now, this is also
a painful process

693
00:36:15,171 --> 00:36:16,339
without a doubt.

694
00:36:16,372 --> 00:36:18,675
The greatest winemakers

695
00:36:18,675 --> 00:36:21,077
still went through
a little rough patch

696
00:36:21,077 --> 00:36:22,546
and then came out.

697
00:36:27,350 --> 00:36:31,588
Alsace, France
is so fascinating.

698
00:36:31,588 --> 00:36:35,258
Whenever there was a war
in Europe,

699
00:36:35,324 --> 00:36:38,161
because of the location
of Alsace,

700
00:36:38,161 --> 00:36:39,395
we never missed one.

701
00:36:39,395 --> 00:36:40,730
We never missed a war.

702
00:36:40,764 --> 00:36:42,666
Alsace once belonged
to Germany,

703
00:36:42,699 --> 00:36:45,502
and there was wine growing
in Alsace in those days.

704
00:36:45,502 --> 00:36:47,671
Now Alsace belongs to France,

705
00:36:47,671 --> 00:36:50,339
and they still grow wine
on the same vineyards.

706
00:36:50,339 --> 00:36:51,908
To explain the Alsace history,

707
00:36:51,908 --> 00:36:55,244
a good example would be
the three last generations.

708
00:36:55,278 --> 00:36:57,413
My grandfather
was born Prussian,

709
00:36:57,413 --> 00:36:58,848
and he studied German.

710
00:36:58,882 --> 00:37:00,283
He didn't speak any French.

711
00:37:00,283 --> 00:37:03,219
My father was born
just before the Second War.

712
00:37:03,252 --> 00:37:05,622
And he studied half French,

713
00:37:05,622 --> 00:37:08,692
and then the war came,
and he studied German.

714
00:37:08,725 --> 00:37:10,560
Results-- he don't speak German,
he don't speak French.

715
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,295
He speaks Alsatian language.

716
00:37:12,295 --> 00:37:15,799
My generation--
I studied French and
I speak fluently French,

717
00:37:15,799 --> 00:37:18,367
so three generations,
three languages.

718
00:37:18,401 --> 00:37:21,070
People in Alsace
have the structure

719
00:37:21,104 --> 00:37:23,072
of the German culture,

720
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:25,308
and they also have
the romance of France.

721
00:37:32,616 --> 00:37:34,918
[Parr]
Clos Sainte Hune Riesling,
I think,

722
00:37:34,918 --> 00:37:38,555
maybe the most--
one of the most compelling wines

723
00:37:38,555 --> 00:37:39,756
on this planet.

724
00:37:39,789 --> 00:37:42,458
Clos Sainte Hune
is certainly revered

725
00:37:42,458 --> 00:37:45,729
as one of the great examples
of Riesling

726
00:37:45,762 --> 00:37:47,597
from one of the great
Riesling growing areas

727
00:37:47,631 --> 00:37:49,298
on the planet Earth.

728
00:37:49,298 --> 00:37:53,803
[Parr]
These wines can age
50 plus years, no problem.

729
00:37:53,837 --> 00:37:55,939
[Dame]
It's one of the greatest single
vineyards in the world.

730
00:37:55,972 --> 00:37:59,308
It produces a wine
that's almost indescribable.

731
00:37:59,308 --> 00:38:01,110
[Parr]
Bergamot, lemon,

732
00:38:01,144 --> 00:38:03,346
all these kind of flavors
you get when they're young.

733
00:38:03,346 --> 00:38:06,482
In its youth,
it's like a slap
across the face

734
00:38:06,482 --> 00:38:07,951
from your mother
when she's pissed off

735
00:38:07,984 --> 00:38:09,853
that you came home late
at night when she told you

736
00:38:09,853 --> 00:38:11,454
to9 be home at 10:00,

737
00:38:11,487 --> 00:38:13,489
but she still forgives you
and loves you the next day,

738
00:38:13,489 --> 00:38:16,359
and ultimately
Clos Sainte Hune will do that
with you also.

739
00:38:16,425 --> 00:38:20,597
And then as they get older,
you get that orangesuckle
bergamot tea,

740
00:38:20,597 --> 00:38:24,033
this very kind of honey
and crushed rocks.

741
00:38:26,002 --> 00:38:27,804
It's got history behind it.

742
00:38:27,837 --> 00:38:30,039
It's got an unbelievable
family behind it

743
00:38:30,039 --> 00:38:34,343
that can go back, I think,
12, 13 generations.

744
00:38:34,343 --> 00:38:36,713
Our father took over in 1952,

745
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:39,182
just after World War II,

746
00:38:39,182 --> 00:38:42,518
and we know how difficult
was that period.

747
00:38:42,518 --> 00:38:44,320
He basically had to sell

748
00:38:44,353 --> 00:38:46,055
all what he could produce,

749
00:38:46,055 --> 00:38:50,560
so he only put a few bottles
on the side, very, very few.

750
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,895
So this '62--

751
00:38:51,895 --> 00:38:54,631
[chuckles]
I must confess is quite rare.

752
00:38:54,664 --> 00:38:56,165
And the more I handle it,

753
00:38:56,165 --> 00:38:58,067
the more I have--
how you call it?

754
00:38:58,067 --> 00:39:02,371
Goosebumps or chicken bumps,
whatever that is. You know?

755
00:39:05,742 --> 00:39:10,413
It's-- It's all what about--
this business is about,

756
00:39:10,413 --> 00:39:12,481
sharing great wine

757
00:39:12,515 --> 00:39:15,652
and sharing the passion
for wine.

758
00:39:15,652 --> 00:39:18,087
So, Julien,
why don't you come here

759
00:39:18,087 --> 00:39:20,223
and have a little sip with me.

760
00:39:23,059 --> 00:39:26,095
So here is Julien,
13th generation.

761
00:39:32,736 --> 00:39:37,106
1962 was rather exceptional
for Alsace,

762
00:39:37,173 --> 00:39:39,075
and I guess,
like the English would say,

763
00:39:39,075 --> 00:39:41,077
the proof is in the pudding.

764
00:39:42,511 --> 00:39:44,013
What do you think?

765
00:39:46,616 --> 00:39:49,018
Still very fresh.

766
00:39:49,052 --> 00:39:51,420
Very fresh, complex minerally,

767
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:52,956
intense, shiny.

768
00:39:53,022 --> 00:39:54,457
It has a great acidity,

769
00:39:54,457 --> 00:39:57,060
the aftertaste.

770
00:39:57,093 --> 00:40:01,030
Well, you have to put
this wine in your memory.

771
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:03,700
You have to register everything.

772
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:06,135
Every little detail
of each vintage

773
00:40:06,135 --> 00:40:07,871
has to be registered
in your mind

774
00:40:07,904 --> 00:40:13,576
in order for you to eventually
have it blind one day

775
00:40:13,576 --> 00:40:15,645
and tell us,
"Oh, my God, I remember.

776
00:40:15,645 --> 00:40:17,113
This is 1962."

777
00:40:17,113 --> 00:40:18,147
Huh?

778
00:40:23,653 --> 00:40:25,154
We know where we come from.

779
00:40:25,154 --> 00:40:27,123
I know
where we are going to go.

780
00:40:27,123 --> 00:40:29,726
I mean, of course
I'm going to die,

781
00:40:29,759 --> 00:40:32,095
hopefully earlier than you,

782
00:40:32,095 --> 00:40:35,431
so we are just in transition.

783
00:40:35,431 --> 00:40:36,800
We are just making sure

784
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,802
that what we have today,

785
00:40:38,802 --> 00:40:41,137
as far as our vineyards
are concerned

786
00:40:41,137 --> 00:40:43,940
and the shape of the winery,
if I may say,

787
00:40:43,973 --> 00:40:47,744
and how the winery is
performing will be donated

788
00:40:47,744 --> 00:40:49,946
to our 13th generation,

789
00:40:49,979 --> 00:40:52,148
in the best possible shape,

790
00:40:52,148 --> 00:40:53,249
so to speak.

791
00:40:54,583 --> 00:40:56,285
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

792
00:40:56,319 --> 00:40:59,588
Skelt. In Alsace we say,
"Skelt."

793
00:40:59,588 --> 00:41:01,825
Skelt. Alsatian dialect.

794
00:41:16,672 --> 00:41:21,978
[Puckette]
In France they do things
through meticulous study,

795
00:41:21,978 --> 00:41:24,047
very little experimentation,

796
00:41:24,047 --> 00:41:25,648
and trying to understand

797
00:41:25,681 --> 00:41:27,183
what it is that they have
around them.

798
00:41:27,183 --> 00:41:29,218
In the U.S. you have people
over here going,

799
00:41:29,218 --> 00:41:31,687
"Well, shit,
can I grow wine here?"

800
00:41:31,687 --> 00:41:33,022
"I don't know."

801
00:41:33,022 --> 00:41:35,524
"Well, Frank,
let's give it a try."

802
00:41:46,535 --> 00:41:48,004
American ingenuity

803
00:41:48,004 --> 00:41:49,839
is constantly playing
with things.

804
00:41:49,873 --> 00:41:53,409
Much of the traditional
European paradigm

805
00:41:53,409 --> 00:41:55,578
is based on the opposite.

806
00:41:55,644 --> 00:41:58,147
We brought grapes
in from Europe.

807
00:41:58,147 --> 00:41:59,983
We're not even using
our own grapes.

808
00:41:59,983 --> 00:42:01,985
We thought one was, Zinfandel,

809
00:42:02,018 --> 00:42:04,053
and then it turns out
it's Croatian.

810
00:42:04,053 --> 00:42:05,388
It's not even ours.

811
00:42:05,388 --> 00:42:06,890
I think an American
has an advantage

812
00:42:06,923 --> 00:42:08,925
over European because of--

813
00:42:08,992 --> 00:42:10,559
his spirit is much freer.

814
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:13,763
There's a lot of freedom
for American winemakers,

815
00:42:13,830 --> 00:42:15,364
wine growers,

816
00:42:15,398 --> 00:42:18,501
to have an experiment
with different grape varieties.

817
00:42:18,501 --> 00:42:19,836
It's a good thing.

818
00:42:19,869 --> 00:42:21,938
It's a young wine region.

819
00:42:21,938 --> 00:42:23,506
I think in maybe
a hundred years

820
00:42:23,539 --> 00:42:24,874
we'll figure it out.

821
00:42:24,908 --> 00:42:26,375
[McClintic]
We are kids in a candy store.

822
00:42:26,375 --> 00:42:29,745
We can plant any grape
we want in any place.

823
00:42:29,745 --> 00:42:31,580
We have no limitations.

824
00:42:35,184 --> 00:42:37,353
[Puckette]
Washington--
it's a crazy region

825
00:42:37,353 --> 00:42:40,289
because there's all these grapes
growing everywhere,

826
00:42:40,289 --> 00:42:43,960
and there's--
like it has no feature,

827
00:42:44,027 --> 00:42:45,795
like, "Oh, there's
good red wine here.

828
00:42:45,795 --> 00:42:48,031
Oh, there's
good Riesling too."

829
00:42:48,064 --> 00:42:50,133
Washington grows a wide range,

830
00:42:50,133 --> 00:42:53,069
probably three dozen
different grape varieties.

831
00:42:53,102 --> 00:42:55,038
And what's amazing to us

832
00:42:55,038 --> 00:42:56,472
is how we have challenged

833
00:42:56,472 --> 00:42:57,807
this classic idea

834
00:42:57,874 --> 00:43:00,709
that you have to grow
Cabernet in Bordeaux

835
00:43:00,709 --> 00:43:01,911
and Riesling in Germany

836
00:43:01,945 --> 00:43:04,047
and pinot noir in Burgundy,

837
00:43:04,047 --> 00:43:06,082
and you can't mix
these things.

838
00:43:10,386 --> 00:43:12,421
What's really great
about what's happening

839
00:43:12,455 --> 00:43:14,457
right now in the landscape
in California

840
00:43:14,457 --> 00:43:16,459
is there's
so much experimentation.

841
00:43:18,161 --> 00:43:21,630
We work with Trousseau Gris,
Pinot Gris.

842
00:43:21,630 --> 00:43:23,066
Frappato,

843
00:43:23,099 --> 00:43:24,767
Lacrima di Morro,

844
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:26,469
Blaufr nkisch,

845
00:43:26,469 --> 00:43:27,803
Pinot Noir,

846
00:43:27,803 --> 00:43:29,572
Syrah, Grenache.

847
00:43:29,605 --> 00:43:31,140
Mourvèdre,

848
00:43:33,009 --> 00:43:34,510
Cabernet Sauvignon.

849
00:43:34,577 --> 00:43:35,778
And we have this climate

850
00:43:35,811 --> 00:43:37,580
that we can do
anything we want.

851
00:43:37,580 --> 00:43:39,482
I'm really into Riesling.
I'll fancy Riesling.

852
00:43:39,482 --> 00:43:41,450
They grow Riesling here,
it'd be badass.

853
00:43:41,484 --> 00:43:45,521
Don't forget that
most American wine businesses

854
00:43:45,521 --> 00:43:46,622
are first generation,

855
00:43:46,655 --> 00:43:48,424
so American winemakers,

856
00:43:48,424 --> 00:43:49,926
by necessity,

857
00:43:49,959 --> 00:43:51,928
have to think more
about the market.

858
00:43:51,928 --> 00:43:53,529
The reality is
cost of living here--

859
00:43:53,529 --> 00:43:55,098
it's a different animal.

860
00:43:55,131 --> 00:43:57,600
You know?
Like, you want to live
in California

861
00:43:57,600 --> 00:44:00,536
where 90% of the nation's wine
comes from?

862
00:44:00,536 --> 00:44:04,340
You know?
Like, you gotta make some cash.

863
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:06,976
There's so much bottom-line
stuff going on,

864
00:44:07,010 --> 00:44:11,014
and, you know,
I'm perfectly happy

865
00:44:11,014 --> 00:44:13,516
with really scraping by

866
00:44:13,516 --> 00:44:16,219
and roasting squirrels
under bridges

867
00:44:16,285 --> 00:44:18,454
as long as I can make
really great wine.

868
00:44:20,856 --> 00:44:22,858
Wine tradition is,
in California,

869
00:44:22,858 --> 00:44:24,493
is an oxymoron,
in my opinion.

870
00:44:24,527 --> 00:44:26,062
We don't want tradition.

871
00:44:26,062 --> 00:44:28,464
That's not what this place
is about.

872
00:44:28,497 --> 00:44:31,134
It's not us.

873
00:44:31,134 --> 00:44:32,801
What a lot of people
don't understand

874
00:44:32,801 --> 00:44:37,806
is California wine,
after the gold rush,
was booming.

875
00:44:37,806 --> 00:44:40,143
We have, like,
1200 wineries now.

876
00:44:40,176 --> 00:44:43,646
We had 800 wineries
in the late 1800s.

877
00:44:43,646 --> 00:44:47,150
It's not like we had
wars fought on our own turf.

878
00:44:47,150 --> 00:44:50,253
People in Alsace are hiding.

879
00:44:50,253 --> 00:44:52,221
You know? They're hiding,

880
00:44:52,221 --> 00:44:53,856
you know, dodging bullets.

881
00:44:53,889 --> 00:44:55,691
They're trying not to die.

882
00:44:55,691 --> 00:44:57,360
We didn't have these problems.

883
00:44:57,360 --> 00:44:59,428
We had a booming wine industry.

884
00:44:59,428 --> 00:45:01,864
We did have this
one thing, however,

885
00:45:01,897 --> 00:45:03,399
and the worst part of it

886
00:45:03,399 --> 00:45:05,068
is we did it to ourselves.

887
00:45:12,008 --> 00:45:13,842
[Lemon]
Prohibition really was a break.

888
00:45:13,876 --> 00:45:16,879
It was an enormous break
in the way--

889
00:45:16,912 --> 00:45:19,182
the whole culture
of American wine.

890
00:45:19,182 --> 00:45:21,750
Whatever we were trying to do
before Prohibition,

891
00:45:21,750 --> 00:45:23,519
it just wiped that slate clean,

892
00:45:23,552 --> 00:45:27,056
and we're only going now
on a hundred years

893
00:45:27,056 --> 00:45:28,591
of winemaking.

894
00:45:28,591 --> 00:45:30,926
It's just tragic.

895
00:45:30,926 --> 00:45:33,196
Yeah, it did screw up
the wine industry,

896
00:45:33,229 --> 00:45:35,464
but it also stopped
a whole lot of things

897
00:45:35,464 --> 00:45:37,433
that could potentially
still be in play

898
00:45:37,433 --> 00:45:39,102
that would've been really bad.

899
00:45:39,102 --> 00:45:41,070
There was no minimum alcohol.

900
00:45:41,104 --> 00:45:42,305
There was no regulation.

901
00:45:42,305 --> 00:45:45,308
And so when
Prohibition happened,

902
00:45:45,308 --> 00:45:47,910
we were, like--
everybody stopped.

903
00:45:47,943 --> 00:45:50,279
We needed
a little sobriety check.

904
00:45:50,279 --> 00:45:52,781
We're talking about grapes
that are the most popular grapes

905
00:45:52,781 --> 00:45:54,117
in the United States.

906
00:45:54,117 --> 00:45:55,451
We're talking
about French grapes--

907
00:45:55,484 --> 00:45:57,886
Chardonnay, Cabernet, Merlot.

908
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:01,590
These are all wines from France,
grapes from France.

909
00:46:01,590 --> 00:46:03,426
If Prohibition had not happened
in the United States,

910
00:46:03,426 --> 00:46:05,394
I think we would be
much more focused

911
00:46:05,394 --> 00:46:06,629
on Italian varieties.

912
00:46:06,629 --> 00:46:10,799
I suspect that things
like Barbera

913
00:46:10,799 --> 00:46:12,135
and maybe even Nebbiolo

914
00:46:12,168 --> 00:46:13,602
or Sangiovese.

915
00:46:13,636 --> 00:46:16,805
Spain also might have had
a greater influence.

916
00:46:16,805 --> 00:46:18,174
It's often forgotten

917
00:46:18,241 --> 00:46:20,643
that some of the whites
in California

918
00:46:20,643 --> 00:46:24,613
that were dominant
pre-Prohibition
were Spanish wines.

919
00:46:24,647 --> 00:46:27,116
[Mattiasson]
It's one of the reasons,
I think, styles have changed

920
00:46:27,116 --> 00:46:28,984
so much the last 56 years.

921
00:46:28,984 --> 00:46:31,154
Every decade style changes
because we're still figuring out

922
00:46:31,154 --> 00:46:33,622
what the hell we are
as an industry.

923
00:46:42,665 --> 00:46:44,300
[McClintic]
Then you've got this guy,

924
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:45,468
Robert Mondavi,

925
00:46:45,468 --> 00:46:47,136
who comes along in the '60s,

926
00:46:47,136 --> 00:46:49,472
and he's like,
"I've got an idea.

927
00:46:49,472 --> 00:46:51,107
"I'm going to open up a winery,

928
00:46:51,107 --> 00:46:52,275
"and not only a winery,

929
00:46:52,308 --> 00:46:56,179
"like a huge, ambitious winery,

930
00:46:56,179 --> 00:46:59,048
"like--
like I want to take down
the French.

931
00:46:59,115 --> 00:47:01,117
"I want to make the best wine
in the world

932
00:47:01,117 --> 00:47:03,119
here in California
at a time--"

933
00:47:03,152 --> 00:47:06,189
It's like-- It's like,
imagine the economy goes down
in, like, 2008,

934
00:47:06,189 --> 00:47:08,957
and you're like,
"I wanna open up
a car manufacturer

935
00:47:08,991 --> 00:47:10,493
in Detroit."

936
00:47:10,526 --> 00:47:14,029
That's what
Robert Mondavi did with wine.

937
00:47:14,029 --> 00:47:16,632
The guy's got brass balls, man.

938
00:47:21,804 --> 00:47:24,307
[Cauble]
If anybody thinks
about American wine,

939
00:47:24,307 --> 00:47:26,209
the first thing
they think about

940
00:47:26,209 --> 00:47:27,743
is Napa Valley,
without a doubt.

941
00:47:27,810 --> 00:47:31,147
I think if Robert Mondavi
didn't exist,

942
00:47:31,180 --> 00:47:33,516
California wine
wouldn't exist.

943
00:47:35,218 --> 00:47:37,153
[woman]
At that time, you know,
in 1960s,

944
00:47:37,186 --> 00:47:40,089
the valley was still kind of--

945
00:47:40,089 --> 00:47:41,657
kind of held back,
you know.

946
00:47:41,690 --> 00:47:45,161
There was-- I think there
was 17,000 acres of grapes.

947
00:47:45,161 --> 00:47:47,230
Today there are 40,000.

948
00:47:47,230 --> 00:47:49,598
Much of the valley
was for sale.

949
00:47:49,665 --> 00:47:52,835
It was still sort of
recuperating

950
00:47:52,868 --> 00:47:57,039
from phylloxera,
from Depression,
from the war and all that.

951
00:47:57,072 --> 00:47:58,874
And many people
didn't believe it,

952
00:47:58,874 --> 00:48:01,444
but he went forward,
built a new winery,

953
00:48:01,444 --> 00:48:04,247
the first new winery
since Prohibition.

954
00:48:10,886 --> 00:48:13,589
So this particular bottle
is the first vintage

955
00:48:13,589 --> 00:48:15,424
created by
the Robert Mondavi Winery,

956
00:48:15,458 --> 00:48:17,426
which opened in 1966.

957
00:48:19,128 --> 00:48:20,629
At one point he was small.

958
00:48:20,696 --> 00:48:23,866
He was boutique.
He was family owned.
He was cool.

959
00:48:23,899 --> 00:48:25,734
And I still think he is

960
00:48:25,734 --> 00:48:27,736
because that part
is, like, history.

961
00:48:27,736 --> 00:48:29,305
You know? And that--

962
00:48:29,305 --> 00:48:31,807
So even if you buy big wines,
like, what's the story?

963
00:48:31,874 --> 00:48:32,975
Why do you buy them?

964
00:48:32,975 --> 00:48:34,477
Why do they become successful?

965
00:48:34,543 --> 00:48:36,245
There was some guts there.

966
00:48:38,481 --> 00:48:41,550
[White]
This was the model
that Mondavi set--

967
00:48:41,584 --> 00:48:43,819
even with this first vintage
is what's still in use today.

968
00:48:43,819 --> 00:48:47,223
You could almost feel, like,
anxiety probably in the bottle,

969
00:48:47,256 --> 00:48:48,957
but also, like, hope.

970
00:48:48,957 --> 00:48:50,559
I think it's amazing.

971
00:48:53,329 --> 00:48:55,097
Wow, this is--

972
00:48:55,130 --> 00:48:57,132
this is actually
an incredible bottle.

973
00:48:57,132 --> 00:48:59,302
It's very, very,
very aromatic,

974
00:48:59,302 --> 00:49:01,136
very perfumed.

975
00:49:01,170 --> 00:49:03,172
The fruits
are red and high toned,

976
00:49:03,172 --> 00:49:04,840
like red apple skin

977
00:49:04,907 --> 00:49:07,410
or like a dried cherry.

978
00:49:07,410 --> 00:49:09,077
And then there's this beautiful

979
00:49:09,111 --> 00:49:10,946
sort of cigar ash

980
00:49:10,979 --> 00:49:12,147
but it's very, very vibrant

981
00:49:12,147 --> 00:49:13,582
and very, very alive.

982
00:49:13,582 --> 00:49:15,751
For me, I think ageability

983
00:49:15,784 --> 00:49:18,487
is a necessary tenet
to greatness in wine.

984
00:49:18,487 --> 00:49:22,157
And this is undeniably
one of the great wines.

985
00:49:22,157 --> 00:49:23,426
[Dame]
In your first wine,

986
00:49:23,459 --> 00:49:24,860
you produce a wine
of that quality

987
00:49:24,860 --> 00:49:28,197
I mean, there's more than luck
in that one.

988
00:49:28,197 --> 00:49:30,366
I wanted to produce wine

989
00:49:30,366 --> 00:49:33,035
to compete with
the finest wines of the world.

990
00:49:33,035 --> 00:49:34,803
Here's the Europeans.
Think about
from their perspective.

991
00:49:34,837 --> 00:49:36,939
You've been doing it
this way from the beginning,

992
00:49:36,939 --> 00:49:39,007
the times the Romans planned
the damn places, right?

993
00:49:39,007 --> 00:49:42,545
And all of a sudden
along comes Robert Mondavi.

994
00:49:46,014 --> 00:49:47,383
I went throughout the world

995
00:49:47,450 --> 00:49:50,319
to find out what
my competition was.

996
00:49:50,353 --> 00:49:52,187
That's something which,
you know, I think

997
00:49:52,187 --> 00:49:53,489
we've all learned
from Robert Mondavi.

998
00:49:53,522 --> 00:49:55,558
He used to always go
around the world

999
00:49:55,558 --> 00:49:56,892
and taste other wines

1000
00:49:56,959 --> 00:49:58,894
and always have a bottle
of Mondavi with him,

1001
00:49:58,894 --> 00:50:01,964
and he used to, like,
always compare his wines

1002
00:50:01,997 --> 00:50:03,399
to other great wines.

1003
00:50:03,399 --> 00:50:06,569
Just an incredible voice
for Napa Valley.

1004
00:50:06,635 --> 00:50:09,505
I think he understood
that if you made a name
for Napa Valley,

1005
00:50:09,538 --> 00:50:12,408
and how great this place is
in the world, everyone rises.

1006
00:50:12,408 --> 00:50:14,643
So it wasn't about
any particular winery.

1007
00:50:14,677 --> 00:50:17,346
He wanted to actually speak
how beautiful this place was.

1008
00:50:17,346 --> 00:50:18,814
In this fine wine business,

1009
00:50:18,814 --> 00:50:21,484
it's not going to take
five years, not ten.

1010
00:50:21,517 --> 00:50:22,885
It's going to take a lifetime.

1011
00:50:22,885 --> 00:50:25,854
You have to be willing
to take a gamble.

1012
00:50:25,888 --> 00:50:29,325
You have to put
your whole heart and soul

1013
00:50:29,325 --> 00:50:31,327
into what you are doing.

1014
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:33,028
But that's all.
It's very simple.

1015
00:50:41,036 --> 00:50:44,273
To figure out what a wine
should cost in the marketplace

1016
00:50:44,273 --> 00:50:46,108
is probably the hardest thing.

1017
00:50:46,174 --> 00:50:47,576
There really isn't one thing

1018
00:50:47,576 --> 00:50:50,946
that solely determines
the cost of the wine.

1019
00:50:51,013 --> 00:50:54,450
I run the other way
when it comes to determining
those sorts of things.

1020
00:50:54,450 --> 00:50:57,052
Um, the gut.

1021
00:50:57,085 --> 00:50:59,955
There is some reason
why wines are expensive.

1022
00:50:59,955 --> 00:51:01,957
There's some reason
why wines are cheap.

1023
00:51:01,957 --> 00:51:03,592
Wine that's inexpensive?

1024
00:51:03,592 --> 00:51:05,428
It is inexpensive

1025
00:51:05,461 --> 00:51:07,630
in a large part
because the costs

1026
00:51:07,696 --> 00:51:09,898
of producing it
were much lower.

1027
00:51:09,932 --> 00:51:14,269
It's because the grapes
cost less to purchase.

1028
00:51:14,269 --> 00:51:16,439
A lot of things
are mechanized

1029
00:51:16,439 --> 00:51:18,374
both in the vineyard
and in the winery.

1030
00:51:18,374 --> 00:51:21,910
[McClintic]
You know, you have to mechanize
everything at that point.

1031
00:51:21,944 --> 00:51:23,946
You have to
or you're not going to have

1032
00:51:23,946 --> 00:51:26,782
a viable economic
business model.

1033
00:51:26,782 --> 00:51:28,451
[Meredith]
And so it ends up being

1034
00:51:28,484 --> 00:51:30,486
a very uniform,
predictable product,

1035
00:51:30,486 --> 00:51:31,987
and that's what it is.

1036
00:51:32,054 --> 00:51:33,456
It's a product.

1037
00:51:33,456 --> 00:51:35,290
It's a commodity product
where you can buy it

1038
00:51:35,290 --> 00:51:38,327
for two, three, four dollars
a bottle.

1039
00:51:38,394 --> 00:51:40,796
With wines
that are 20 to 50 dollars,

1040
00:51:40,796 --> 00:51:43,399
presumably many of them
are handcrafted,

1041
00:51:43,432 --> 00:51:44,900
and there's a lot of work,

1042
00:51:44,900 --> 00:51:49,672
and a lot of effort
went into it.

1043
00:51:49,672 --> 00:51:51,474
I think there's
this inherent guilt factor

1044
00:51:51,474 --> 00:51:52,808
with a lot of people

1045
00:51:52,841 --> 00:51:55,177
to spend over $20 a bottle
on a wine.

1046
00:51:55,177 --> 00:51:57,112
I know my parents have it.

1047
00:51:57,145 --> 00:51:58,747
My parents are the best,

1048
00:51:58,747 --> 00:52:00,949
but there's a lot of people,
a lot of family,

1049
00:52:00,983 --> 00:52:02,150
a lot of friends I know,

1050
00:52:02,150 --> 00:52:03,285
they have this guilt factor

1051
00:52:03,318 --> 00:52:04,620
associated with
a bottle of wine

1052
00:52:04,620 --> 00:52:06,121
that's over $20,
let's say.

1053
00:52:06,154 --> 00:52:09,324
More often than not,
those wines are handcrafted,

1054
00:52:09,324 --> 00:52:10,993
painstakingly handcrafted,

1055
00:52:10,993 --> 00:52:13,796
and there's a lot of hands
that touch that wine,

1056
00:52:13,796 --> 00:52:16,965
and so get the guilt
out of your system

1057
00:52:16,965 --> 00:52:20,102
because there are a lot
of people who have a job

1058
00:52:20,102 --> 00:52:21,437
because of you.

1059
00:52:21,437 --> 00:52:23,038
Well, the profession's
the reason.

1060
00:52:23,038 --> 00:52:25,273
First you've got the guy
who's got to prepare the soil,

1061
00:52:25,307 --> 00:52:28,811
the guy who's got to study
the soil.

1062
00:52:28,811 --> 00:52:31,714
The guy who's gotta say,
"Your soil's good for Cabernet,"

1063
00:52:31,714 --> 00:52:33,882
the people
that farm it every day.

1064
00:52:35,484 --> 00:52:37,352
Then you go to the harvesters,

1065
00:52:37,352 --> 00:52:38,854
the people that pick
the grapes.

1066
00:52:38,887 --> 00:52:41,056
Then it comes into the winery.

1067
00:52:41,123 --> 00:52:43,191
You have to have
somebody who's there
at the sorting table

1068
00:52:43,191 --> 00:52:44,693
to make sure that nothing--

1069
00:52:44,693 --> 00:52:47,630
what they call M.O.G.,
material other than grapes,

1070
00:52:47,663 --> 00:52:49,197
is getting into the wine.

1071
00:52:49,197 --> 00:52:50,533
You have the--
the guardians

1072
00:52:50,533 --> 00:52:53,068
who usher the grapes
and the juice

1073
00:52:53,135 --> 00:52:55,871
into the winemaking process.

1074
00:52:55,871 --> 00:52:57,706
The guy who made the barrel.

1075
00:52:57,740 --> 00:52:59,542
If you go into a cooperage,

1076
00:52:59,542 --> 00:53:01,176
there are about
15 different roles

1077
00:53:01,209 --> 00:53:02,545
just in the cooperage alone--

1078
00:53:02,545 --> 00:53:04,046
the guy who's in charge
of making sure

1079
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:06,148
that the wood
is seasoned properly.

1080
00:53:06,181 --> 00:53:08,350
Then the guy who's
in charge of making sure

1081
00:53:08,383 --> 00:53:09,885
that the barrels are sanded,

1082
00:53:09,885 --> 00:53:11,887
then the guy who is there
to make sure

1083
00:53:11,887 --> 00:53:14,089
that the drums are all there
in the barrel is sound
and tight

1084
00:53:14,156 --> 00:53:15,991
right down to the guy
who runs the hose in it

1085
00:53:16,024 --> 00:53:18,393
to make sure
it's tested well.

1086
00:53:18,393 --> 00:53:19,762
If it gets to the winery, okay.

1087
00:53:19,828 --> 00:53:21,363
Now you have to maintain
those barrels,

1088
00:53:21,396 --> 00:53:23,899
and that takes
a whole team of people.

1089
00:53:23,899 --> 00:53:25,868
And then who has to know
when it's time

1090
00:53:25,868 --> 00:53:27,536
for the wine to come
out of the barrel,

1091
00:53:27,570 --> 00:53:29,237
when it's time to go
into the bottle.

1092
00:53:29,237 --> 00:53:30,873
Who's designed the label?
Who's designed the bottle?

1093
00:53:30,873 --> 00:53:32,708
Who's going to make sure
that the corks are sound

1094
00:53:32,741 --> 00:53:35,377
and safe and gonna be secure?

1095
00:53:35,377 --> 00:53:38,380
What about the capsules?
Who's going to put it
in the boxes?

1096
00:53:38,380 --> 00:53:41,049
Who's going to be involved
in driving it to the port?

1097
00:53:41,049 --> 00:53:44,052
Taking that ship
across the ocean?

1098
00:53:44,052 --> 00:53:47,022
And who's going to be involved
in getting the container
to the warehouse?

1099
00:53:47,022 --> 00:53:52,127
And you've got
three tiers of sales
element involved.

1100
00:53:52,127 --> 00:53:53,529
What about the guy--

1101
00:53:53,562 --> 00:53:55,964
the sommelier who's got
to take inventory?

1102
00:53:57,800 --> 00:54:00,302
So up until the time
the cork is pulled,

1103
00:54:00,302 --> 00:54:01,937
you've got, I would say,

1104
00:54:01,937 --> 00:54:04,306
hundreds of hands
that have been involved

1105
00:54:04,372 --> 00:54:05,574
in this process.

1106
00:54:29,431 --> 00:54:32,434
[Puckette]
The cost of labor?
Some things cost money.

1107
00:54:32,467 --> 00:54:34,637
But then there's
this other thing

1108
00:54:34,637 --> 00:54:37,172
that I'm putting
my heart and soul

1109
00:54:37,172 --> 00:54:38,674
into this thing.

1110
00:54:38,741 --> 00:54:41,176
I'm making an art,
a form of art.

1111
00:54:41,176 --> 00:54:43,912
How much is that worth?
How much is art worth?

1112
00:54:43,946 --> 00:54:45,981
A lot of wine
is a luxury product,

1113
00:54:45,981 --> 00:54:48,751
so when you get to
that real top of the pyramid,

1114
00:54:48,784 --> 00:54:50,252
you're paying
for how many other people

1115
00:54:50,252 --> 00:54:52,320
want to spend
that huge amount of money

1116
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:53,822
for that wine?

1117
00:54:53,856 --> 00:54:55,858
I'll give you an example.
DRC made wine--

1118
00:54:55,858 --> 00:54:57,359
has made wine
for many, many years.

1119
00:55:06,602 --> 00:55:08,671
They've always used new oak.

1120
00:55:08,671 --> 00:55:11,206
They've had the same vineyards,

1121
00:55:11,273 --> 00:55:12,541
but the price of the wine

1122
00:55:12,541 --> 00:55:14,309
is always higher.

1123
00:55:14,342 --> 00:55:17,179
Every year they increase--
almost every year--

1124
00:55:17,179 --> 00:55:18,681
and people buy it.

1125
00:55:18,681 --> 00:55:20,883
That's-- the wine is amazing.
Wine is great.

1126
00:55:20,949 --> 00:55:23,518
Every year they produce
at a very, very high level.

1127
00:55:23,518 --> 00:55:26,454
So that doesn't mean that,
you know,

1128
00:55:26,488 --> 00:55:28,490
perhaps the cost of good
is going up.

1129
00:55:28,523 --> 00:55:30,559
It's just demand and supply.

1130
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:33,495
This is considered,
pound for pound,

1131
00:55:33,528 --> 00:55:35,297
the most expensive wine
in the world.

1132
00:55:35,297 --> 00:55:38,734
It's not uncommon
for a bottle of DRC,

1133
00:55:38,734 --> 00:55:40,302
depending on
which vineyard it is,

1134
00:55:40,335 --> 00:55:41,503
depending on the vintage,

1135
00:55:41,503 --> 00:55:43,839
to open up, current release,

1136
00:55:43,872 --> 00:55:45,708
five to ten thousand dollars
a bottle.

1137
00:55:45,708 --> 00:55:47,843
It's just crazy stuff.

1138
00:55:47,843 --> 00:55:50,012
I think if you look
at each individual grape,

1139
00:55:50,045 --> 00:55:52,915
depending on where you are,
it could be up to $5 a grape

1140
00:55:52,915 --> 00:55:55,250
if you break it down
to the grape.
It's crazy.

1141
00:56:10,699 --> 00:56:13,869
Aubert de Villaine,
since 1974,

1142
00:56:13,869 --> 00:56:14,870
has been the proprietor

1143
00:56:14,870 --> 00:56:17,372
of Domaine de la Romanée-Conti.

1144
00:56:17,405 --> 00:56:19,875
Um, he's the legend, man.

1145
00:56:25,914 --> 00:56:29,685
If you get a winery visit
at DRC,

1146
00:56:29,718 --> 00:56:31,219
it's like the Holy Grail.

1147
00:56:31,253 --> 00:56:33,922
So to spend time
in a cellar with that man

1148
00:56:33,922 --> 00:56:36,424
is like, for any sommelier
or wine person

1149
00:56:36,424 --> 00:56:38,961
anywhere in the world that's--
that's kind of the pinnacle.

1150
00:56:39,027 --> 00:56:40,462
Something in the cosmos

1151
00:56:40,462 --> 00:56:43,131
has to align or you really
gotta know somebody

1152
00:56:43,198 --> 00:56:44,933
to get a winery
appointment there.

1153
00:56:44,933 --> 00:56:46,769
They don't do
winery appointments.

1154
00:56:49,404 --> 00:56:50,706
I've never been there.

1155
00:56:50,706 --> 00:56:52,875
Most of my friends
have not been there.

1156
00:56:52,875 --> 00:56:54,910
And they're some
of the foremost experts

1157
00:56:54,943 --> 00:56:56,779
on Burgundy in the country.

1158
00:57:00,415 --> 00:57:01,750
Voilà. Oui.

1159
00:57:01,784 --> 00:57:05,220
We shall taste--
We shall open the bottle here

1160
00:57:05,220 --> 00:57:06,554
if you don't mind.

1161
00:57:12,460 --> 00:57:16,799
[McClintic]
I think the mark
of a legendary winery

1162
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:18,566
is it doesn't matter
what vintage it is,

1163
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:19,902
it's going to be great,

1164
00:57:19,902 --> 00:57:21,970
and certainly you can say
that about DRC.

1165
00:57:21,970 --> 00:57:25,140
In off vintages,
bad vintages,

1166
00:57:25,140 --> 00:57:28,343
these wines trade
for thousands of dollars.

1167
00:57:28,410 --> 00:57:30,145
It's the real deal.

1168
00:57:30,145 --> 00:57:32,647
You're not going to find
a better expression
of Pinot Noir

1169
00:57:32,647 --> 00:57:33,816
in the world.

1170
00:57:33,816 --> 00:57:35,684
This is a--

1171
00:57:35,751 --> 00:57:40,188
It's a bottle of
Echezeaux, 2004.

1172
00:57:41,957 --> 00:57:44,827
And '04 is one
of the vintages

1173
00:57:44,827 --> 00:57:47,796
where things were difficult
during the season,

1174
00:57:47,830 --> 00:57:50,833
but we had a very good,
beautiful end of season

1175
00:57:50,833 --> 00:57:56,371
with north wind, sun,
clear skies.

1176
00:57:56,438 --> 00:57:59,507
It's a vintage
I personally like very much.

1177
00:58:05,547 --> 00:58:06,982
[swishing wine]

1178
00:58:09,852 --> 00:58:14,056
You have this special texture,

1179
00:58:14,056 --> 00:58:17,559
this special way
to touch your palate

1180
00:58:17,559 --> 00:58:20,896
that a wine
of a difficult year

1181
00:58:20,896 --> 00:58:25,633
has a texture
that is a little more sharp,

1182
00:58:25,667 --> 00:58:28,403
a little more acid.

1183
00:58:28,403 --> 00:58:32,040
This bouquet of a forest,

1184
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:35,043
you know,
for a unique forest.

1185
00:58:35,077 --> 00:58:37,512
None of yet the rose petal,

1186
00:58:37,545 --> 00:58:42,350
but I know it will come
in what, 10, 20 years,

1187
00:58:42,350 --> 00:58:46,154
and it will make
a delicious wine.

1188
00:58:48,490 --> 00:58:50,058
Uh, you know what?

1189
00:58:50,058 --> 00:58:53,762
I think what many people
don't understand,

1190
00:58:53,829 --> 00:58:59,667
it's that wine
is made to drink

1191
00:58:59,701 --> 00:59:04,372
and to-- if you are thirsty,
to quench your thirst.

1192
00:59:04,406 --> 00:59:08,610
Many people think of wine
only as an object of culture.

1193
00:59:08,610 --> 00:59:10,946
And it is
an object of culture,

1194
00:59:11,013 --> 00:59:13,015
but it is-- it is also food.

1195
00:59:13,048 --> 00:59:15,350
It's food.
It's an element.

1196
00:59:15,350 --> 00:59:19,454
And it's important to take it
that way too.

1197
00:59:45,747 --> 00:59:47,249
We always like to kid around
and say

1198
00:59:47,249 --> 00:59:50,052
that wood
is the spouse of wine.

1199
00:59:50,052 --> 00:59:54,622
And so if you--
just as in real-life marriage,

1200
00:59:54,622 --> 00:59:56,624
you should choose your wife
very, very carefully

1201
00:59:56,624 --> 00:59:59,127
'cause otherwise you're only
going to pay for it in the end

1202
00:59:59,161 --> 01:00:00,495
in terms of quality of life.

1203
01:00:00,495 --> 01:00:02,931
And in this case
it's quality of wine.

1204
01:00:05,300 --> 01:00:09,404
Oak is a vessel.
You can either ferment wine
in the vessel,

1205
01:00:09,437 --> 01:00:12,307
and/or you can age it
in the vessel.

1206
01:00:12,307 --> 01:00:16,644
It has been the basis
for a vessel to transport wine

1207
01:00:16,644 --> 01:00:20,983
for God knows, like,
I think the Etruscans started
using the barrel,

1208
01:00:20,983 --> 01:00:23,485
so we can say
thousands of years
we've used oak.

1209
01:00:23,518 --> 01:00:26,188
It's only in the last 25 years
we've begun to say,

1210
01:00:26,254 --> 01:00:27,755
"I don't want oaky wine.

1211
01:00:27,789 --> 01:00:28,957
[McClintic]
There's neutral oak,

1212
01:00:28,991 --> 01:00:30,658
which imparts no flavor,

1213
01:00:30,658 --> 01:00:31,994
and then there's new oak,

1214
01:00:31,994 --> 01:00:33,795
which does impart flavor.

1215
01:00:33,828 --> 01:00:35,097
You start with the wine.

1216
01:00:35,097 --> 01:00:37,132
You make it,
you ferment it.

1217
01:00:37,165 --> 01:00:39,334
and then you put it
into oak barrels.

1218
01:00:39,334 --> 01:00:40,936
All these additional flavors

1219
01:00:40,969 --> 01:00:43,671
are added to the wines.

1220
01:00:43,671 --> 01:00:46,274
[McClintic]
French oak, you're typically
going to get vanilla,

1221
01:00:46,308 --> 01:00:47,976
cloves, cinnamon,
baking spices,

1222
01:00:47,976 --> 01:00:49,611
that add to the wine.

1223
01:00:49,611 --> 01:00:50,712
With American oak

1224
01:00:50,712 --> 01:00:52,047
you get dill, coconut,

1225
01:00:52,114 --> 01:00:53,648
even a higher extract
of vanilla.

1226
01:00:53,681 --> 01:00:56,885
I'm not that interested in wine
that tastes of vanilla.

1227
01:00:56,885 --> 01:00:59,621
Vanilla is not a natural taste
of a grape.

1228
01:00:59,654 --> 01:01:00,956
It's something added.

1229
01:01:00,956 --> 01:01:03,825
So, let's say,
instead of making wine,

1230
01:01:03,858 --> 01:01:05,560
let's make a drink,
a cocktail,

1231
01:01:05,560 --> 01:01:08,063
something like that.

1232
01:01:08,063 --> 01:01:09,797
If you can taste the oak,

1233
01:01:09,831 --> 01:01:12,567
you've kind of, you know,

1234
01:01:12,567 --> 01:01:13,902
missed the fruit.

1235
01:01:13,969 --> 01:01:15,403
You can think of oak like salt.

1236
01:01:15,403 --> 01:01:17,872
You've had a dish
that's too salty,

1237
01:01:17,872 --> 01:01:19,574
that's all you taste,
is salt,

1238
01:01:19,641 --> 01:01:23,311
and so the question becomes,
how much oak is too much oak?

1239
01:01:23,311 --> 01:01:26,514
Fifteen years ago customers
liked one with more body,

1240
01:01:26,548 --> 01:01:30,152
more rich, more oaky,
more extreme.

1241
01:01:30,152 --> 01:01:32,354
Now, even if you use oak,

1242
01:01:32,387 --> 01:01:34,056
you say,
"Oh, no, I don't use oak."

1243
01:01:34,056 --> 01:01:35,390
Now there's certain situations

1244
01:01:35,390 --> 01:01:37,892
where oak is called for
like salt is called for.

1245
01:01:37,892 --> 01:01:39,394
Right?

1246
01:01:39,394 --> 01:01:42,064
Certain Cabernets without oak
would be so austere

1247
01:01:42,064 --> 01:01:45,833
and intensely harsh
on your palate and grippy

1248
01:01:45,867 --> 01:01:47,702
that you need oak
to buffer that.

1249
01:01:47,702 --> 01:01:50,438
And someone's opinion of what's
too much and what's too little

1250
01:01:50,438 --> 01:01:52,941
depends on how much
they like oak. You know?

1251
01:01:53,008 --> 01:01:57,845
What's true is you can cover up
a lot of mistakes
in the vineyard

1252
01:01:57,879 --> 01:02:00,682
and cover a lot of mistakes
in the cellar with oak,

1253
01:02:00,682 --> 01:02:04,186
and so a lot of people
abuse it in that way
and say, "You know what?

1254
01:02:04,219 --> 01:02:06,554
We screwed up a little bit,"
or "These grapes are shit,

1255
01:02:06,588 --> 01:02:09,191
"so why don't we just slap
a big vanilla bomb on it

1256
01:02:09,191 --> 01:02:10,358
and call it a day?"

1257
01:02:10,392 --> 01:02:12,727
Wine is made here,
in the vineyard,

1258
01:02:12,727 --> 01:02:14,096
not in the cellar.

1259
01:02:14,096 --> 01:02:16,531
In the cellar you have to work
for preserving

1260
01:02:16,564 --> 01:02:18,900
what the nature gave you
in the vineyard.

1261
01:02:18,900 --> 01:02:20,235
And the wood is good way

1262
01:02:20,268 --> 01:02:23,271
to maintain a wine
in good conditions

1263
01:02:23,271 --> 01:02:25,607
during the aging process.

1264
01:02:25,607 --> 01:02:29,544
If you look
at the great oak debate,

1265
01:02:29,577 --> 01:02:32,914
I mean, it's politics.
It's Republicans as Democrats.

1266
01:02:32,947 --> 01:02:34,916
They are party lines drawn

1267
01:02:34,916 --> 01:02:36,918
with oak and non-oak,

1268
01:02:36,951 --> 01:02:39,121
and it's always gonna
be like that.

1269
01:02:39,121 --> 01:02:40,755
If you're going to look
anywhere in the world,

1270
01:02:40,755 --> 01:02:43,091
and you want a place
to see an example of this,

1271
01:02:43,125 --> 01:02:44,492
just look at Barolo.

1272
01:02:50,398 --> 01:02:52,634
[Cauble]
So what we have here
is a 1985 Barolo

1273
01:02:52,634 --> 01:02:53,968
from Elio Altare.

1274
01:02:54,002 --> 01:02:56,604
He is one of the most,
I would say,

1275
01:02:56,638 --> 01:02:59,141
influential modern producers
of Barolo,

1276
01:02:59,141 --> 01:03:00,675
and this is one
of the first vintages

1277
01:03:00,675 --> 01:03:04,179
he actually made
with using new French oak.

1278
01:03:04,179 --> 01:03:07,949
Barolo is a place
in Northern Italy,

1279
01:03:07,982 --> 01:03:10,452
and the grape is Nebbiolo.

1280
01:03:10,452 --> 01:03:12,354
It's interesting that Barolo

1281
01:03:12,354 --> 01:03:14,622
was made for hundreds of years
the same way,

1282
01:03:14,656 --> 01:03:17,259
and the aging would happen
in these big botti,

1283
01:03:17,259 --> 01:03:19,161
these big barrels

1284
01:03:19,161 --> 01:03:20,828
that the grand, grand
grandpas had built.

1285
01:03:22,797 --> 01:03:24,366
The wines were very austere,

1286
01:03:24,366 --> 01:03:26,868
very serious, very tannic,
very dry, high acidity.

1287
01:03:26,934 --> 01:03:29,871
You would have to wait years
before you could approach them.

1288
01:03:29,871 --> 01:03:31,373
This is a really rare bottle.

1289
01:03:31,373 --> 01:03:33,708
I think there's less
than six or seven bottles

1290
01:03:33,708 --> 01:03:37,712
at the estates,
pretty incredible
story of what happened.

1291
01:03:41,049 --> 01:03:42,717
Some crazy winemakers,

1292
01:03:42,717 --> 01:03:46,521
and I include my dad Elio,

1293
01:03:46,521 --> 01:03:49,791
he was one of the first
to start approaching
the winemaking

1294
01:03:49,824 --> 01:03:51,393
with different techniques.

1295
01:03:51,393 --> 01:03:53,828
They started moving from,
you know,

1296
01:03:53,861 --> 01:03:55,863
big botti, the big vats,

1297
01:03:55,863 --> 01:03:58,032
to French oak.

1298
01:03:58,032 --> 01:03:59,367
It changed tradition.

1299
01:03:59,401 --> 01:04:02,904
It kind of caused
a very big problem.

1300
01:04:02,904 --> 01:04:05,907
Wasn't necessarily a war with,
you know, with weapons,

1301
01:04:05,973 --> 01:04:08,643
but it was a war
with words for sure.

1302
01:04:11,079 --> 01:04:13,215
It smells incredibly elegant,

1303
01:04:13,215 --> 01:04:16,551
really, really soft,
incredibly floral.

1304
01:04:16,551 --> 01:04:19,821
It really has a lot
of Burgundian traits to it.

1305
01:04:19,854 --> 01:04:21,723
A big crisis hit Barolo.

1306
01:04:21,723 --> 01:04:23,825
We're talking about mid '70s,
late '70s.

1307
01:04:23,858 --> 01:04:26,328
Most of the young people
would leave the countryside

1308
01:04:26,328 --> 01:04:29,931
to work in the Fiat factories
that make cars in Torino

1309
01:04:29,931 --> 01:04:31,266
because being a farmer

1310
01:04:31,266 --> 01:04:33,568
was like really the last job
on earth.

1311
01:04:33,568 --> 01:04:36,771
Just wine wasn't
a business back then.

1312
01:04:36,838 --> 01:04:39,341
That's when my dad in '76

1313
01:04:39,374 --> 01:04:42,444
took his car, went to Burgundy
for the first time

1314
01:04:42,444 --> 01:04:44,512
and just starting, you know,

1315
01:04:44,546 --> 01:04:46,514
our curiosity visiting wineries,

1316
01:04:46,514 --> 01:04:48,383
and then he got in touch
with some winemakers

1317
01:04:48,416 --> 01:04:51,419
who worked
in different wineries.

1318
01:04:51,419 --> 01:04:54,055
Those guys were famous
making amazing wines.

1319
01:04:54,055 --> 01:04:58,059
They were very expensive.
They were all rich
and superstars.

1320
01:04:58,059 --> 01:05:00,228
Here they were starving.
They were poor.

1321
01:05:00,262 --> 01:05:02,464
So my dad came home
with all these crazy ideas,

1322
01:05:02,464 --> 01:05:04,031
went to his dad and said,

1323
01:05:04,065 --> 01:05:05,467
"Dad, why don't we try this?"

1324
01:05:05,467 --> 01:05:08,970
And the answer was,
"No way, you can't try."

1325
01:05:09,036 --> 01:05:13,275
[chuckles]
You can't not think
about the relationship

1326
01:05:13,275 --> 01:05:15,743
between Elio and his dad here.

1327
01:05:15,777 --> 01:05:18,446
The move towards using
new French oak on this wine

1328
01:05:18,446 --> 01:05:21,082
caused a massive fissure
between him and his father,

1329
01:05:21,115 --> 01:05:25,487
which never really
repaired itself.

1330
01:05:25,487 --> 01:05:27,054
[Silvia Altare]
My grandpa would've told you,

1331
01:05:27,088 --> 01:05:30,258
"Oh, buy a bottle of Barolo
but drink it in 25 years."

1332
01:05:30,292 --> 01:05:33,895
Thank you.
Maybe I want to
drink it tomorrow.

1333
01:05:33,895 --> 01:05:36,431
[Cauble]
When you put a wine
like Barolo in new oak,

1334
01:05:36,464 --> 01:05:37,799
it's going to soften
the tannins.

1335
01:05:37,799 --> 01:05:39,667
It's going to make it
easier to drink

1336
01:05:39,734 --> 01:05:41,569
and more approachable
when it's young.

1337
01:05:44,639 --> 01:05:47,509
[Silvia Altare]
My dad started buying barrels,

1338
01:05:47,575 --> 01:05:50,478
but to make space
in the cellar for barrels,

1339
01:05:50,478 --> 01:05:52,614
he had to buy a chainsaw as well

1340
01:05:52,647 --> 01:05:54,148
to cut the big botti
in pieces

1341
01:05:54,148 --> 01:05:55,317
because there was no space,

1342
01:05:55,350 --> 01:05:57,018
so he was cutting in pieces

1343
01:05:57,084 --> 01:06:00,021
these botti that
one of his ancestors had built,

1344
01:06:00,021 --> 01:06:02,524
you know, those botti
were a hundred years old.

1345
01:06:07,329 --> 01:06:08,663
Grandpa would not accept that,

1346
01:06:08,663 --> 01:06:11,666
so that was the big--
big break between them.

1347
01:06:11,699 --> 01:06:13,701
You know, in the 1970s
and the 1980s

1348
01:06:13,701 --> 01:06:15,703
people hated each other over it.

1349
01:06:15,770 --> 01:06:17,772
It was either you were
on the left or the right.

1350
01:06:17,805 --> 01:06:20,375
It was, like,
you were using new oak?

1351
01:06:20,375 --> 01:06:21,776
Your neighbors
wouldn't talk to you.

1352
01:06:21,809 --> 01:06:24,646
I mean, it's--
it's a pretty big deal.

1353
01:06:24,679 --> 01:06:28,115
Once he put new oak
on his wine,

1354
01:06:28,115 --> 01:06:29,951
the wines sold,

1355
01:06:29,951 --> 01:06:31,986
and they're more expensive.

1356
01:06:33,888 --> 01:06:35,390
Wine's very soft,

1357
01:06:35,390 --> 01:06:38,025
but it does have this
kind of orange peel, fennel,

1358
01:06:38,025 --> 01:06:39,361
and kind of tar component,

1359
01:06:39,361 --> 01:06:40,862
which is classic in Nebbiolo.

1360
01:06:40,862 --> 01:06:42,196
The wine's delicious.

1361
01:06:42,196 --> 01:06:43,398
[Silvia Altare]
Twenty-five years ago

1362
01:06:43,465 --> 01:06:45,132
it was a huge fight.

1363
01:06:45,166 --> 01:06:46,868
Today some of my best friends

1364
01:06:46,868 --> 01:06:49,371
are son or daughters
of traditionalists.

1365
01:06:49,371 --> 01:06:52,707
I talk to them.
I don't have a problem
with that.

1366
01:06:52,740 --> 01:06:54,409
Well, my dad
wouldn't talk to them.

1367
01:06:54,476 --> 01:06:56,511
Cancel that.
[laughs]

1368
01:07:04,819 --> 01:07:06,254
[Dame]
Wine is constantly changing.

1369
01:07:06,254 --> 01:07:07,255
It's living.
It's breathing.

1370
01:07:07,322 --> 01:07:08,723
And as a result

1371
01:07:08,723 --> 01:07:10,558
how can you have
an appreciation

1372
01:07:10,558 --> 01:07:12,727
for a single great variety

1373
01:07:12,760 --> 01:07:14,429
when it's made in
so many different styles

1374
01:07:14,496 --> 01:07:16,063
and so many different places

1375
01:07:16,063 --> 01:07:17,432
and so many different vintages

1376
01:07:17,499 --> 01:07:19,166
and all the things
that go into

1377
01:07:19,166 --> 01:07:20,201
whether you like Pinot Noir,

1378
01:07:20,234 --> 01:07:21,569
Cabernet, or Chardonnay

1379
01:07:21,569 --> 01:07:23,170
or Sauvignon Blanc.

1380
01:07:23,204 --> 01:07:24,606
That's a great question.

1381
01:07:30,077 --> 01:07:32,246
I think the hardest thing

1382
01:07:32,246 --> 01:07:34,081
for me to stomach
about the whole game

1383
01:07:34,081 --> 01:07:38,286
is the whole idea
of points.

1384
01:07:38,286 --> 01:07:39,787
I'll meet people that,

1385
01:07:39,787 --> 01:07:41,789
"Oh, you know, I only collect
wines above 90 points."

1386
01:07:41,789 --> 01:07:45,793
"From who?
Uh, you know, which demigod
do you follow?"

1387
01:07:49,964 --> 01:07:51,433
Taste is so different.

1388
01:07:51,433 --> 01:07:53,267
You can't all look
at the same piece of art

1389
01:07:53,301 --> 01:07:54,936
and all want to put it
in your house.

1390
01:07:54,936 --> 01:07:58,473
How we look at points--
this is a super
polarizing topic.

1391
01:07:58,540 --> 01:08:00,775
Essentially points are
to tell you what to think

1392
01:08:00,775 --> 01:08:02,777
if you don't have
an opinion yourself.

1393
01:08:02,810 --> 01:08:04,979
Well, the rating system
was first created

1394
01:08:04,979 --> 01:08:06,247
to help consumers.

1395
01:08:06,280 --> 01:08:07,649
It really was.

1396
01:08:07,649 --> 01:08:08,883
Because before that

1397
01:08:08,916 --> 01:08:10,485
the people who wrote
about wine

1398
01:08:10,485 --> 01:08:13,154
were actually hired
by the wine marketers

1399
01:08:13,220 --> 01:08:15,323
to write about wines.

1400
01:08:15,323 --> 01:08:17,392
So suddenly you had these
independent people coming out

1401
01:08:17,425 --> 01:08:19,226
with these mailing lists,

1402
01:08:19,226 --> 01:08:22,830
and one of those guys
was Robert Parker
in Wine Advocate.

1403
01:08:22,830 --> 01:08:26,468
And he started putting points
on the system.

1404
01:08:26,468 --> 01:08:28,235
Personally, I hate points.

1405
01:08:28,269 --> 01:08:29,904
I revere and respect
Robert Parker.

1406
01:08:29,904 --> 01:08:32,139
I revere and respect
the Wine Spectator

1407
01:08:32,139 --> 01:08:33,575
because what they do

1408
01:08:33,608 --> 01:08:35,176
is get more people
to drink wine.

1409
01:08:35,176 --> 01:08:36,644
That's ultimately what I want.

1410
01:08:38,813 --> 01:08:41,683
At the end of the day
it's a really lazy way
to describe a wine.

1411
01:08:41,749 --> 01:08:44,018
It attempts to put two numbers
next to something

1412
01:08:44,018 --> 01:08:47,922
that has been produced
by so many passionate people.

1413
01:08:47,955 --> 01:08:50,124
I don't even remember
the last time I thought
about points.

1414
01:08:50,124 --> 01:08:52,527
I mean, it's not relevant
to sommeliers

1415
01:08:52,527 --> 01:08:53,861
to think about,
like, a hundred points.

1416
01:08:53,861 --> 01:08:55,697
I think that most of us
would be like, "Ew,

1417
01:08:55,763 --> 01:08:57,765
if a sales rep
starts quoting points..."

1418
01:08:57,765 --> 01:09:01,335
[Parr]
I mean, if you buy a bottle
of current vintage Barolo,

1419
01:09:01,335 --> 01:09:03,337
which got a 99 points,

1420
01:09:03,337 --> 01:09:05,507
and you go home and open it,

1421
01:09:05,540 --> 01:09:07,475
there will be no enjoyment
from it.

1422
01:09:07,509 --> 01:09:09,343
You know, it's--
yeah, it got a high score,

1423
01:09:09,343 --> 01:09:10,512
and you open it.

1424
01:09:10,512 --> 01:09:11,846
Yeah, if you waited 10 years,

1425
01:09:11,846 --> 01:09:13,881
absolutely, it'll be better,

1426
01:09:13,948 --> 01:09:17,351
but it doesn't say
"99 points, wait for 10 years."

1427
01:09:17,351 --> 01:09:20,321
If I gave one of these critics

1428
01:09:20,354 --> 01:09:21,856
25 wines

1429
01:09:21,856 --> 01:09:23,458
that they had given scores to,

1430
01:09:23,458 --> 01:09:24,959
what do you think the odds are

1431
01:09:24,992 --> 01:09:27,629
giving the same score
back to back?

1432
01:09:27,629 --> 01:09:29,296
I don't know.

1433
01:09:29,296 --> 01:09:30,698
Answer that yourself.

1434
01:09:30,698 --> 01:09:33,468
Points in Wine Spectator
and Robert Parker

1435
01:09:33,501 --> 01:09:35,637
were a huge part
of my beginning.

1436
01:09:35,637 --> 01:09:37,639
I didn't know
the world of wine,

1437
01:09:37,672 --> 01:09:39,340
and I didn't know
a lot of people,

1438
01:09:39,340 --> 01:09:40,908
but I could read a publication,

1439
01:09:40,908 --> 01:09:44,412
and what I got
out of Spectator

1440
01:09:44,479 --> 01:09:45,980
and what I got out
of Robert Parker,

1441
01:09:45,980 --> 01:09:49,917
these critics,
were "Here are wines,

1442
01:09:49,917 --> 01:09:52,353
great wines of the world
that you should try."

1443
01:09:52,386 --> 01:09:53,888
This wine got a hundred points.

1444
01:09:53,888 --> 01:09:56,524
I'm like, "Okay, what's
this wine all about?"

1445
01:09:56,524 --> 01:09:58,259
From a sales perspective,

1446
01:09:58,259 --> 01:10:00,394
it offers confidence to people,

1447
01:10:00,394 --> 01:10:02,697
perhaps, to create
short lists of wines

1448
01:10:02,730 --> 01:10:05,433
and that it benchmarks us
against other great wines

1449
01:10:05,433 --> 01:10:06,601
of the world.

1450
01:10:28,756 --> 01:10:31,292
[Cauble]
Max Schubert
was the winemaker

1451
01:10:31,292 --> 01:10:33,194
at Penfolds
starting late 1940s,

1452
01:10:33,227 --> 01:10:35,129
and his creation of Grange

1453
01:10:35,129 --> 01:10:38,232
totally changed the way
the world looks at Australia.

1454
01:10:38,265 --> 01:10:39,601
What Max Schubert wanted to do

1455
01:10:39,601 --> 01:10:45,106
was make a world-class
Bordeaux style wine

1456
01:10:45,106 --> 01:10:47,942
in Australia,
and he went to Bordeaux.

1457
01:10:47,975 --> 01:10:50,444
He studied the great domaines
of Bordeaux,

1458
01:10:50,444 --> 01:10:53,214
and he figured out
exactly what they did,

1459
01:10:53,247 --> 01:10:54,949
studied their template to a T.

1460
01:10:54,949 --> 01:10:58,920
Only problem was there wasn't
a lot of Cabernet in Australia,

1461
01:10:58,953 --> 01:11:01,789
so he adjusted that template
with the Syrah grape.

1462
01:11:01,789 --> 01:11:03,558
You have to think
about at the time

1463
01:11:03,558 --> 01:11:07,829
the world was basically
drinking fortified wine
down in Australia.

1464
01:11:07,829 --> 01:11:09,396
That was the fashion
of the day.

1465
01:11:09,430 --> 01:11:12,734
So to make not only
a dry table wine

1466
01:11:12,734 --> 01:11:15,837
but to make a wine that
would stand the test of time

1467
01:11:15,837 --> 01:11:17,972
30, 40, 50 years later

1468
01:11:17,972 --> 01:11:21,475
was revolutionary thinking
for his day.

1469
01:11:21,509 --> 01:11:25,747
Think of the blend of Cabernet
with Syrah or with Shiraz.

1470
01:11:25,780 --> 01:11:28,082
It's a quintessential
Australian blend,

1471
01:11:28,082 --> 01:11:31,919
and Bin 60A out
of the Vintage 1962

1472
01:11:31,919 --> 01:11:34,789
is deemed to be
the crème de la crme

1473
01:11:34,822 --> 01:11:37,191
of that offer ever.

1474
01:11:45,366 --> 01:11:49,203
[man]
Now, this one
is incredibly venerated...

1475
01:11:50,838 --> 01:11:52,607
the rarity of this wine.

1476
01:11:52,607 --> 01:11:54,108
I mean, 5,000 bottles
of this wine

1477
01:11:54,141 --> 01:11:55,610
were made in 1962,

1478
01:11:55,610 --> 01:11:59,446
and I'd probably say
less than a dozen

1479
01:11:59,480 --> 01:12:00,848
exist to this day.

1480
01:12:00,848 --> 01:12:03,718
It has received
many global accolades.

1481
01:12:03,785 --> 01:12:06,520
Harvey Steiman,
Editor of Wine Spectator,

1482
01:12:06,520 --> 01:12:08,022
gave it a hundred points.

1483
01:12:08,055 --> 01:12:11,559
Considered the greatest
Australian wine ever made.

1484
01:12:11,626 --> 01:12:14,562
It's been given
perfect scores by many people.

1485
01:12:14,562 --> 01:12:17,398
The Bin 60A came in
at number 7

1486
01:12:17,464 --> 01:12:20,635
of the greatest wines
ever made on this planet.

1487
01:12:20,668 --> 01:12:22,670
Most critics,
most wine people,

1488
01:12:22,704 --> 01:12:25,539
would say that this
is your bucket list wine.

1489
01:12:25,539 --> 01:12:27,742
You have to try this
before you die.

1490
01:12:32,146 --> 01:12:34,982
This bottle hasn't moved
from the winery

1491
01:12:34,982 --> 01:12:38,152
since it was bottled
in 1964.

1492
01:12:39,887 --> 01:12:42,389
The cork
has thankfully done its job.

1493
01:12:52,099 --> 01:12:53,735
Absolute heaven.

1494
01:12:55,569 --> 01:12:57,404
Yeah, the wine's
in fantastic shape.

1495
01:13:01,876 --> 01:13:05,212
Very, very sundried black plum
and blackberry

1496
01:13:05,246 --> 01:13:08,115
and almost stewed lamb
kind of characteristic.

1497
01:13:11,753 --> 01:13:16,724
[Gago]
Now, I say of wines that get
perfect scores in their youth,

1498
01:13:16,758 --> 01:13:18,693
really they're still
on probation.

1499
01:13:18,693 --> 01:13:20,194
You know, is it a hundred
going that way,

1500
01:13:20,227 --> 01:13:22,196
or a hundred going that way?
You wouldn't know.

1501
01:13:22,196 --> 01:13:25,967
But when a wine that's 30, 40,
50, 60 years of age

1502
01:13:25,967 --> 01:13:27,568
gets a hundred points,

1503
01:13:27,601 --> 01:13:30,437
that wine can't hide
behind alcohol,

1504
01:13:30,437 --> 01:13:31,939
extract, or oak.

1505
01:13:31,939 --> 01:13:33,708
It's basically naked
in front of you.

1506
01:13:33,708 --> 01:13:35,142
It's unplanned.

1507
01:13:38,479 --> 01:13:41,482
Regardless of what you feel
about point scores,

1508
01:13:41,482 --> 01:13:44,151
if you are a high-end winery

1509
01:13:44,218 --> 01:13:46,253
and you have
a big case production

1510
01:13:46,287 --> 01:13:49,323
and you get over 95 points
on your wine,

1511
01:13:49,323 --> 01:13:51,258
you're not going to be
unhappy about that.

1512
01:13:51,292 --> 01:13:54,095
Do point scores matter?
Point scores may matter
for some.

1513
01:13:54,095 --> 01:13:55,596
We like our point scores.

1514
01:13:55,629 --> 01:13:57,464
We take our point scores
with stride.

1515
01:13:57,464 --> 01:13:59,400
We appreciate them.
We're not going to
give them back,

1516
01:13:59,433 --> 01:14:01,635
but that's not the first thing
we tout at all.

1517
01:14:01,635 --> 01:14:03,771
But if we're asked,

1518
01:14:03,805 --> 01:14:06,741
then I'll say, "Yeah,
that vintage of Grange
got 100 points.

1519
01:14:06,741 --> 01:14:08,175
"Yeah, that vintage
of Grange got 99.

1520
01:14:08,175 --> 01:14:10,778
Yeah, that vintage
of Bin 60A got 100 points."

1521
01:14:10,812 --> 01:14:12,479
Of course I'll say it
if they ask,

1522
01:14:12,479 --> 01:14:13,948
but I'll say it,

1523
01:14:13,981 --> 01:14:15,649
and then I'll move back
into the vineyards,

1524
01:14:15,649 --> 01:14:17,819
they style, the history,
the why.

1525
01:14:17,819 --> 01:14:19,420
That's what's most important.

1526
01:14:40,507 --> 01:14:42,509
[Grieco]
Forget the money
that you paid for the bottle,

1527
01:14:42,543 --> 01:14:45,012
forget who the hell made it,
and even for a moment

1528
01:14:45,012 --> 01:14:48,482
forget the history and all
the shit that I love so much.

1529
01:14:48,515 --> 01:14:50,484
It goes with food.

1530
01:14:52,153 --> 01:14:56,958
The opportunity for a sommelier
to pair wine with food--

1531
01:14:56,958 --> 01:14:59,626
it's indisputable
that it can heighten

1532
01:14:59,626 --> 01:15:02,196
and change an experience.

1533
01:15:02,196 --> 01:15:04,031
A lot of food and wine pairing
is bullshit.

1534
01:15:04,031 --> 01:15:06,200
A lot of food and wine pairing
is over-thought.

1535
01:15:06,233 --> 01:15:09,403
To say food and wine pairing
is bullshit?

1536
01:15:09,470 --> 01:15:13,808
Okay. I mean, that's like saying
peanut butter and jelly
is bullshit.

1537
01:15:13,808 --> 01:15:15,576
There's a reason
why that works.

1538
01:15:15,576 --> 01:15:17,411
Right?
A reason why we like that.

1539
01:15:17,478 --> 01:15:19,981
If you just had peanut butter,
you'd do this...

1540
01:15:19,981 --> 01:15:22,016
[smacking roof of mouth]
Right?

1541
01:15:22,049 --> 01:15:24,551
Or that jelly
has acidity in it.
It cuts it.

1542
01:15:27,721 --> 01:15:29,056
[slurps]

1543
01:15:33,427 --> 01:15:36,030
[swishes]

1544
01:15:36,063 --> 01:15:39,700
So my favorite food and wine
pairings are simple.

1545
01:15:39,700 --> 01:15:43,204
Muscadet and oysters.

1546
01:15:43,204 --> 01:15:45,940
A glass of Chianti
and a piece of lamb.

1547
01:15:45,940 --> 01:15:48,575
Sausage
and some Gewurztraminer.

1548
01:15:48,575 --> 01:15:50,744
It's almost cliché,
but a lot of people heard it,

1549
01:15:50,778 --> 01:15:52,279
but what grows together,
goes together.

1550
01:15:52,346 --> 01:15:56,784
Plants and food
that grows in an area

1551
01:15:56,784 --> 01:15:58,452
and grapes that grow
in the area,

1552
01:15:58,452 --> 01:16:00,454
the wine and the food
tends to match up

1553
01:16:00,521 --> 01:16:01,755
almost every time.

1554
01:16:01,755 --> 01:16:03,090
People in France will say

1555
01:16:03,124 --> 01:16:05,559
Sauternes and foie gras
go really well together.

1556
01:16:05,592 --> 01:16:08,095
You would think
that the savoriness
of the foie gras

1557
01:16:08,095 --> 01:16:10,731
and the sweetness
of the Sauternes
might be a conflict,

1558
01:16:10,764 --> 01:16:12,066
but actually
that's the richness.

1559
01:16:12,066 --> 01:16:13,634
They just both
kind of come together

1560
01:16:13,634 --> 01:16:18,472
and really make the experience
much more harmonious.

1561
01:16:18,472 --> 01:16:23,144
To me a food and wine pairing
is like a relationship

1562
01:16:23,144 --> 01:16:25,612
between two human beings.

1563
01:16:25,612 --> 01:16:26,747
It's like a marriage,

1564
01:16:26,780 --> 01:16:29,450
hopefully, with no divorce.

1565
01:16:29,450 --> 01:16:31,785
Traditionally Brussels sprouts,
asparagus, cauliflower,

1566
01:16:31,819 --> 01:16:35,122
all of those green,
leafy vegetables
are really hard to pair.

1567
01:16:35,122 --> 01:16:36,991
[McClintic]
Rosé can pair
really, really well

1568
01:16:37,058 --> 01:16:40,161
with awkward vegetables.
How many times you had
a salad on the table,

1569
01:16:40,161 --> 01:16:42,129
you're like, "Dude,
my wine tastes terrible"?

1570
01:16:42,129 --> 01:16:43,764
"I got vinaigrette
in my mouth

1571
01:16:43,797 --> 01:16:45,432
and this wine tastes sour.
It's awful."

1572
01:16:45,432 --> 01:16:47,835
If you are stuck
in a wine pairing

1573
01:16:47,835 --> 01:16:49,136
and don't know what to do,

1574
01:16:49,136 --> 01:16:50,737
don't forget champagne.

1575
01:16:50,771 --> 01:16:54,608
Champagne is an enormous
food friendly style of wine.

1576
01:16:54,608 --> 01:16:58,079
You can even go
through the entire meal
with that.

1577
01:16:58,079 --> 01:17:00,414
There's something to be said
for trial and error--

1578
01:17:00,414 --> 01:17:02,449
example,
Syrah and Indian food.

1579
01:17:02,483 --> 01:17:04,818
You know,
usually with spicy food,

1580
01:17:04,818 --> 01:17:07,188
the last thing you want
is a spicy wine.

1581
01:17:07,188 --> 01:17:08,956
You just think
it would be overkill,

1582
01:17:08,990 --> 01:17:11,859
but for whatever reason,
Syrah and Indian food
is incredible.

1583
01:17:11,859 --> 01:17:13,627
Yeah, you've got
some good ones out there--

1584
01:17:13,660 --> 01:17:15,329
Spam and Gew rztraminer.

1585
01:17:15,329 --> 01:17:17,598
[Puckette]
Red bean chili
and sparkling wine.

1586
01:17:17,631 --> 01:17:20,201
[man]
Peanut butter ice cream
and Beaujolais.

1587
01:17:20,201 --> 01:17:21,702
Popcorn and chardonnay
is pretty cool.

1588
01:17:21,702 --> 01:17:22,970
Chardonnay doesn't pair well

1589
01:17:23,004 --> 01:17:24,471
with a lot of things
because of oak.

1590
01:17:24,471 --> 01:17:27,141
Oak tends to conflict
with pairing,

1591
01:17:27,174 --> 01:17:28,842
but when you have
buttery things,

1592
01:17:28,842 --> 01:17:30,777
popcorn, it works.

1593
01:17:30,777 --> 01:17:32,646
Save the milk.

1594
01:17:32,679 --> 01:17:34,181
Like a decent Marsala

1595
01:17:34,181 --> 01:17:35,549
and chocolate chip cookies,

1596
01:17:35,549 --> 01:17:37,451
like nut-free
chocolate chip cookies,

1597
01:17:37,484 --> 01:17:39,220
and then when you add
the Marsala,

1598
01:17:39,220 --> 01:17:42,023
it tastes like there's nuts
in your cookies now.

1599
01:17:42,023 --> 01:17:43,958
The consumer still believes

1600
01:17:43,991 --> 01:17:45,659
that red wine
doesn't go with fish.

1601
01:17:45,659 --> 01:17:47,061
Simple as that seems,

1602
01:17:47,061 --> 01:17:49,130
like some of the best pairings
I've had lately

1603
01:17:49,163 --> 01:17:52,366
have been light red wines
with fish, so...

1604
01:17:52,366 --> 01:17:53,400
Oh, I'm hungry.

1605
01:17:53,467 --> 01:17:55,369
Every dish has an opening
for wine.

1606
01:17:58,139 --> 01:17:59,240
Hot dog with normal toppings,

1607
01:17:59,240 --> 01:18:01,075
so we're talking about bun,

1608
01:18:01,142 --> 01:18:02,809
we're talking about relish,

1609
01:18:02,809 --> 01:18:04,545
we're talking about ketchup,

1610
01:18:04,545 --> 01:18:06,680
maybe a little bit of mustard,
maybe raw onion.

1611
01:18:06,713 --> 01:18:08,882
I would say probably
the most fun one here

1612
01:18:08,882 --> 01:18:11,552
might be a Beaujolais.

1613
01:18:11,552 --> 01:18:15,556
You don't have a wine
that is too scholarly

1614
01:18:15,556 --> 01:18:16,890
or too pontificating.

1615
01:18:16,924 --> 01:18:18,392
And it's a hot dog,
for God sake.

1616
01:18:18,392 --> 01:18:19,893
You know?
We all love hot dogs,

1617
01:18:19,927 --> 01:18:22,229
and Beaujolais
is not fussy either,

1618
01:18:22,229 --> 01:18:24,031
so they should be together.

1619
01:18:29,236 --> 01:18:31,905
[Parr]
The most underrated region
in the world

1620
01:18:31,905 --> 01:18:33,174
is Beaujolais.

1621
01:18:33,207 --> 01:18:34,841
I'd probably have to say
Beaujolais.

1622
01:18:34,841 --> 01:18:36,510
Beaujolais, I think,

1623
01:18:36,510 --> 01:18:39,346
delivers the best quality
and drinking experience

1624
01:18:39,346 --> 01:18:41,182
for red wine,
dollar for dollar.

1625
01:18:41,215 --> 01:18:42,716
Some of the most
pleasurable wines

1626
01:18:42,749 --> 01:18:44,185
that I come across.

1627
01:18:44,185 --> 01:18:46,720
Beaujolais would be
at the top of the list.

1628
01:18:46,753 --> 01:18:48,422
There are two types of wines.

1629
01:18:48,422 --> 01:18:50,057
There are intellectual wines,

1630
01:18:50,057 --> 01:18:52,559
and there are
just delicious wines.

1631
01:18:52,559 --> 01:18:55,929
This wine
is certainly intellectual.

1632
01:18:55,929 --> 01:18:57,898
It's got crazy finesse.

1633
01:18:57,931 --> 01:18:59,900
There's a lot going on
in this wine.

1634
01:18:59,900 --> 01:19:01,302
It's super complex.

1635
01:19:01,302 --> 01:19:05,806
It just also happens to be
insanely delicious.

1636
01:19:05,806 --> 01:19:07,308
I can't keep my hands off it.

1637
01:19:07,308 --> 01:19:10,711
It's like catnip
for sommeliers.

1638
01:19:12,379 --> 01:19:15,282
Sommelier can be the best
and the worst.

1639
01:19:15,282 --> 01:19:17,084
They are very important

1640
01:19:17,118 --> 01:19:19,120
if they make the bridge

1641
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:20,554
between the producer

1642
01:19:20,554 --> 01:19:22,056
and the drinker.

1643
01:19:22,089 --> 01:19:26,093
Producer is
Jean-Louis Dutraive.

1644
01:19:26,093 --> 01:19:28,762
It's a hundred percent Gamay.

1645
01:19:28,795 --> 01:19:31,498
I don't always have
the exact same taste
as my guests,

1646
01:19:31,498 --> 01:19:33,334
and oftentimes
that's a lot of the case

1647
01:19:33,400 --> 01:19:35,569
with a lot of sommeliers,
is that their taste

1648
01:19:35,602 --> 01:19:38,672
is totally different
from the tastes of the guest.

1649
01:19:38,672 --> 01:19:41,242
The inside joke in the wine
production business now

1650
01:19:41,275 --> 01:19:42,476
is that everybody
should be producing

1651
01:19:42,476 --> 01:19:45,079
Trousseau Gris in California

1652
01:19:45,112 --> 01:19:46,813
because the somms
think it's so great.

1653
01:19:46,813 --> 01:19:49,316
I think the things that
people hate about sommeliers

1654
01:19:49,316 --> 01:19:50,917
is that we're so opinionated

1655
01:19:50,951 --> 01:19:52,353
about one particular style
of wine

1656
01:19:52,353 --> 01:19:54,955
or how wine should be.

1657
01:19:54,988 --> 01:19:56,490
He's got so much knowledge,

1658
01:19:56,490 --> 01:19:59,493
and his tastes
have changed remarkably.

1659
01:19:59,493 --> 01:20:03,130
Since the moment
he started his journey
into the wine business...

1660
01:20:06,433 --> 01:20:08,435
till the moment
that he's a sommelier.

1661
01:20:08,469 --> 01:20:10,637
- [camera shutters clicking]
- [no audible dialogue]

1662
01:20:10,671 --> 01:20:13,440
You can bet
that the guy's going home

1663
01:20:13,440 --> 01:20:15,842
and drinking some crazy
oxidized natural wine.

1664
01:20:15,842 --> 01:20:18,312
This happens to be
a crazy natural wine producer.

1665
01:20:18,345 --> 01:20:22,116
He uses barely any sulfur
in the winemaking process,

1666
01:20:22,116 --> 01:20:24,485
hardly extracts at all.
He doesn't do anything.

1667
01:20:24,518 --> 01:20:27,321
He lets it sit in the tank,
slightly submerged.

1668
01:20:27,321 --> 01:20:31,292
This crazy new red variety
made by a guy in eggs

1669
01:20:31,292 --> 01:20:32,626
that are lined with wood

1670
01:20:32,659 --> 01:20:34,461
that are buried
in the forest out back,

1671
01:20:34,461 --> 01:20:37,298
and only the girls
can touch 'em kind of a thing.

1672
01:20:37,298 --> 01:20:39,166
And he's able to achieve this

1673
01:20:39,200 --> 01:20:42,303
with complete
minimal intervention.

1674
01:20:42,303 --> 01:20:44,338
It's absolutely insane
how he does this.

1675
01:20:44,371 --> 01:20:48,475
But these beautiful floral
and spicy herbaceous notes...

1676
01:20:50,311 --> 01:20:53,547
You know so much.

1677
01:20:53,547 --> 01:20:55,216
What?

1678
01:20:55,216 --> 01:20:56,650
On the other side,

1679
01:20:56,683 --> 01:20:58,885
you've got this person
who picks something

1680
01:20:58,885 --> 01:21:00,354
that you've never heard of

1681
01:21:00,387 --> 01:21:02,223
from a region that you
don't even know exists,

1682
01:21:02,223 --> 01:21:04,558
that tastes like
what you really want,

1683
01:21:04,558 --> 01:21:07,328
and it exposes you
to an entire new world

1684
01:21:07,328 --> 01:21:08,495
that you never knew existed.

1685
01:21:12,399 --> 01:21:14,701
I mean,
you taste a lot of wine,

1686
01:21:14,701 --> 01:21:17,003
and this wine
has crazy X factor,

1687
01:21:17,003 --> 01:21:20,174
so we're talking about
the southern part of Burgundy,

1688
01:21:20,207 --> 01:21:22,609
just below Pinot Noir Mecca,

1689
01:21:22,609 --> 01:21:25,078
and you're going to pay
$30 a bottle

1690
01:21:25,078 --> 01:21:26,247
for a bottle like this

1691
01:21:26,247 --> 01:21:27,448
whereas Burgundy

1692
01:21:27,514 --> 01:21:29,850
can run you
into triple digits.

1693
01:21:29,850 --> 01:21:33,454
And if you had this
with just about anything,

1694
01:21:33,454 --> 01:21:36,056
even seafood,
you want red wine with fish,

1695
01:21:36,089 --> 01:21:38,359
this is your ultimate play
right here.

1696
01:21:40,527 --> 01:21:42,529
Over time any wine drinker--
it's not just the sommeliers--

1697
01:21:42,529 --> 01:21:44,198
people who drink wine a lot,

1698
01:21:44,198 --> 01:21:46,367
you want to drink
the truth of what

1699
01:21:46,400 --> 01:21:47,901
is coming from the earth.

1700
01:21:47,934 --> 01:21:50,137
And that means tasting
the dirt of where it comes from.

1701
01:21:50,137 --> 01:21:53,374
And at the end
of the day most wines
that are fruit forward,

1702
01:21:53,407 --> 01:21:56,410
you can't taste
what's behind that.

1703
01:21:56,443 --> 01:21:58,279
It's like there's
all this makeup

1704
01:21:58,279 --> 01:21:59,780
in front of seeing the truth

1705
01:21:59,813 --> 01:22:00,981
of what's in the glass.

1706
01:22:10,291 --> 01:22:11,958
[Dame]
I don't they
they can help themselves.

1707
01:22:11,958 --> 01:22:14,295
I don't believe sommeliers
can help themselves

1708
01:22:14,328 --> 01:22:17,631
from the constant thirst
for knowledge,

1709
01:22:17,631 --> 01:22:20,634
and we do love to share it.

1710
01:22:20,667 --> 01:22:23,570
And I think that's--
that's the part of
the equation you left out.

1711
01:22:23,604 --> 01:22:26,307
We love to learn,
and we love to share it.

1712
01:22:26,307 --> 01:22:28,775
Sometimes
a little bit too much.

1713
01:22:28,809 --> 01:22:30,644
[McClintic]
If you're going to talk
about sommeliers,

1714
01:22:30,644 --> 01:22:32,779
you've got to talk
about the old-school guys.

1715
01:22:32,779 --> 01:22:35,249
And if you're going to talk
about the old-school guys,

1716
01:22:35,249 --> 01:22:36,917
you've got to talk
about Fred Dame.

1717
01:22:38,652 --> 01:22:43,357
Fred Dame is perhaps
the most important sommelier

1718
01:22:43,357 --> 01:22:47,027
in-- which means anything
in America.

1719
01:22:47,093 --> 01:22:48,862
[Cauble]
I mean, I think wine service
in America

1720
01:22:48,862 --> 01:22:51,532
would not be anywhere close
to where it is without Fred.

1721
01:23:00,507 --> 01:23:01,942
So the idea of a sommelier--

1722
01:23:01,975 --> 01:23:03,444
think of the white gloves.

1723
01:23:03,444 --> 01:23:06,146
You think of, you know,
the tastevin buttoned up,

1724
01:23:06,179 --> 01:23:07,714
and you picture a butler.

1725
01:23:09,383 --> 01:23:11,017
And then there's Fred,

1726
01:23:11,017 --> 01:23:14,154
who's either in a wine dinner

1727
01:23:14,187 --> 01:23:15,689
at some major market,

1728
01:23:15,689 --> 01:23:17,958
or he's hunting
in the middle of nowhere.

1729
01:23:22,529 --> 01:23:24,698
Have you ever seen
the movie Star Wars?

1730
01:23:24,698 --> 01:23:26,333
I kind of think of Fred Dame

1731
01:23:26,333 --> 01:23:27,534
as the character of Yoda.

1732
01:23:43,750 --> 01:23:46,086
Why are we sitting
in the middle of a duck pond?

1733
01:23:46,152 --> 01:23:48,054
'Cause it's beautiful.

1734
01:23:48,054 --> 01:23:51,558
And you talk about sommeliers

1735
01:23:51,558 --> 01:23:53,894
in the world of wine
and the vintages.

1736
01:23:53,894 --> 01:23:55,396
Great.

1737
01:23:55,429 --> 01:23:57,230
But look at the experience.

1738
01:23:57,230 --> 01:23:59,900
It's about the experience.

1739
01:23:59,933 --> 01:24:03,103
[chuckles]
Fred Dame has probably
opened more great wine

1740
01:24:03,103 --> 01:24:04,938
for people than anyone.

1741
01:24:04,938 --> 01:24:08,275
[McClintic]
You have a guy who's been
on the floor that long.

1742
01:24:08,342 --> 01:24:10,844
Fred has got more stories
in his back pocket

1743
01:24:10,877 --> 01:24:12,746
than you could
possibly imagine.

1744
01:24:15,115 --> 01:24:17,918
I used to work
at a restaurant called
the Sardine Factory,

1745
01:24:17,918 --> 01:24:19,252
Monterey, California.

1746
01:24:19,252 --> 01:24:20,954
And one of the owners
is Ted Balestreri.

1747
01:24:21,021 --> 01:24:22,523
The other's Bert Cutino.

1748
01:24:22,523 --> 01:24:23,890
We're all good friends
with Leon Panetta,

1749
01:24:23,924 --> 01:24:25,926
who was the head of the CIA
at the time.

1750
01:24:25,926 --> 01:24:27,928
Of course the hunt
for Bin Laden was on.

1751
01:24:27,928 --> 01:24:30,431
And when I was
the cellar master there,

1752
01:24:30,431 --> 01:24:32,799
we bought a bottle
of 1870 Lafite.

1753
01:24:35,769 --> 01:24:39,239
[Parr]
1870 Lafite is priceless,

1754
01:24:39,239 --> 01:24:40,907
among the rarest wines
on the planet,

1755
01:24:40,941 --> 01:24:43,109
if not the rarest wine.

1756
01:24:43,109 --> 01:24:44,878
[Dame]
So it's been sitting
in the cellar,

1757
01:24:44,911 --> 01:24:47,247
and every year they have
a New Year's Eve party,

1758
01:24:47,280 --> 01:24:48,949
and Leon comes to the party.

1759
01:24:48,949 --> 01:24:50,751
So he's always asking
about the 1870 Lafite.

1760
01:24:50,751 --> 01:24:52,319
So they're sitting there
one night.

1761
01:24:52,319 --> 01:24:53,787
It's probably
the end of the night.

1762
01:24:53,787 --> 01:24:55,789
They've drunk
a lot of wine, had a good time,

1763
01:24:55,789 --> 01:24:58,258
and Ted goes,
"Tell you what, Leon.

1764
01:24:58,291 --> 01:24:59,626
"You get Osama bin Laden,

1765
01:24:59,626 --> 01:25:01,628
I'll open that bottle
for you."

1766
01:25:01,628 --> 01:25:03,397
And everybody had
a good laugh.

1767
01:25:03,397 --> 01:25:04,965
And a couple months go by,

1768
01:25:04,965 --> 01:25:07,801
and his wife Silvia calls Ted
and goes,

1769
01:25:07,801 --> 01:25:09,503
"You ought to be watching
the 6:00 news

1770
01:25:09,570 --> 01:25:11,972
and tell Fred to get
his corkscrew out."

1771
01:25:11,972 --> 01:25:15,308
So we had a dinner.
It was very special.

1772
01:25:15,308 --> 01:25:17,978
I didn't know where it was going
to be till the last minute

1773
01:25:17,978 --> 01:25:20,447
because it involved
a lot of people

1774
01:25:20,481 --> 01:25:22,483
way up in the security world,

1775
01:25:22,483 --> 01:25:25,786
but we opened that 1870 Lafite.

1776
01:25:30,156 --> 01:25:31,658
But how do you serve 50 people

1777
01:25:31,658 --> 01:25:33,293
out of a single bottle of wine?

1778
01:25:33,293 --> 01:25:35,295
So I got a pipette,

1779
01:25:35,328 --> 01:25:37,531
and I got CIA shot glasses.

1780
01:25:37,531 --> 01:25:38,865
with the logo on them.

1781
01:25:38,865 --> 01:25:40,534
The Secret Service guys
are like,

1782
01:25:40,534 --> 01:25:41,868
"You know, guys,
I only got one.

1783
01:25:41,868 --> 01:25:43,336
"If I drop this, we're screwed.

1784
01:25:43,336 --> 01:25:44,938
Can you give me
a couple feet here?"

1785
01:25:44,971 --> 01:25:46,807
So we decanted it out,
I pipetted it,

1786
01:25:46,807 --> 01:25:48,775
and we all tried 1870 Lafite.

1787
01:25:49,776 --> 01:25:52,045
Just intense and powerful,

1788
01:25:52,045 --> 01:25:53,847
sweet fruit,

1789
01:25:53,847 --> 01:25:58,552
and 1870 was
one of the most celebrated
Bordeauxs of all time.

1790
01:25:58,619 --> 01:26:00,454
[Dame]
If you just drunk the wine
by itself,

1791
01:26:00,487 --> 01:26:03,189
you sat there and had tears
in your eyes,

1792
01:26:03,189 --> 01:26:07,193
but when you consider

1793
01:26:07,227 --> 01:26:08,495
what bin Laden did

1794
01:26:08,529 --> 01:26:10,230
and all the things
that occurred,

1795
01:26:10,230 --> 01:26:11,231
it was spectacular.

1796
01:26:23,877 --> 01:26:26,847
You can take the most expensive
bottle of wine you have

1797
01:26:26,880 --> 01:26:29,049
and-- in your collection--

1798
01:26:29,049 --> 01:26:31,485
get a great connoisseur,

1799
01:26:31,485 --> 01:26:33,554
a great sommelier,

1800
01:26:33,554 --> 01:26:35,155
and two guys off the street,

1801
01:26:35,188 --> 01:26:36,890
set it down and pull that cork,

1802
01:26:36,890 --> 01:26:39,593
and everybody's enjoying it

1803
01:26:39,660 --> 01:26:41,094
in a little different way.

1804
01:26:41,094 --> 01:26:42,362
That's the secret of it.

1805
01:26:42,395 --> 01:26:44,397
The complexity and the layers

1806
01:26:44,397 --> 01:26:48,735
are there for those
who want it,

1807
01:26:48,735 --> 01:26:52,338
but they're not essential
to the enjoyment

1808
01:26:52,338 --> 01:26:54,274
of wine.

1809
01:26:54,274 --> 01:26:55,776
Wine is very much like life.

1810
01:26:55,776 --> 01:26:58,278
You know, life is these series
of fleeting moments,

1811
01:26:58,344 --> 01:26:59,580
and then it's done,

1812
01:26:59,580 --> 01:27:01,281
and-- and that's--
you know,

1813
01:27:01,347 --> 01:27:03,917
sometimes you just gotta open
the bottle of wine and drink it.

1814
01:27:03,917 --> 01:27:05,586
You've got
this bottle of wine.

1815
01:27:05,619 --> 01:27:07,521
It's in a restaurant.
It's been ordered.

1816
01:27:07,554 --> 01:27:08,889
It's going to come
to a table.

1817
01:27:08,889 --> 01:27:12,693
And with it in
that 25.4 ounces of liquid

1818
01:27:12,693 --> 01:27:14,728
are all these stories.

1819
01:27:14,761 --> 01:27:16,196
The people, the place,
the soil,

1820
01:27:16,196 --> 01:27:17,864
when it was harvested.

1821
01:27:17,864 --> 01:27:19,566
How much work
you put into it,

1822
01:27:19,600 --> 01:27:22,135
what you went through,
how much you made,

1823
01:27:22,135 --> 01:27:23,904
how much it cost,
none of that matters.

1824
01:27:23,937 --> 01:27:25,939
It all comes down
to that one bottle

1825
01:27:25,939 --> 01:27:28,809
that's in front of two people.

1826
01:27:28,809 --> 01:27:30,711
[Parr]
One of the most
important things about wine

1827
01:27:30,744 --> 01:27:32,112
is where it ends up

1828
01:27:32,112 --> 01:27:35,281
and who opens it
and when they open it,

1829
01:27:35,315 --> 01:27:36,583
who do they open it with.

1830
01:27:36,617 --> 01:27:38,251
And the experience they have,

1831
01:27:38,251 --> 01:27:40,554
you know, the sex they have,
the fight they have,

1832
01:27:40,554 --> 01:27:43,256
the dinner they have,
the memory they have.

1833
01:27:43,289 --> 01:27:45,158
And it should really create
joy in your life.

1834
01:27:45,158 --> 01:27:48,495
Because your perception
is what makes it special,

1835
01:27:48,562 --> 01:27:50,430
and people forget that.

1836
01:27:50,463 --> 01:27:54,000
Just imagine
how many of those bottles
are just going out there

1837
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:57,738
for all these people to just,
you know, have their way with.

1838
01:27:57,771 --> 01:27:58,939
Once you pop a cork

1839
01:27:58,972 --> 01:28:00,641
and you put it in that glass,

1840
01:28:00,641 --> 01:28:03,176
only one thing matters--

1841
01:28:03,243 --> 01:28:04,978
is it delicious?
