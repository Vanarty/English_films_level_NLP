1
00:00:11,177 --> 00:00:12,136
Are you watching me?

2
00:00:14,597 --> 00:00:16,015
Do I look dashing?

3
00:00:16,141 --> 00:00:17,474
Nobody says
"dashing."

4
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,143
James Bond says
"dashing."

5
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:20,686
You think you're
James Bond?

6
00:00:20,812 --> 00:00:22,187
I could be James Bond.

7
00:00:23,106 --> 00:00:24,732
I've got Connery's
swagger.

8
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:28,068
Definitely
Daniel Craig's physique.

9
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:30,070
Lazenby's...

10
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:33,032
I have no idea
what he's known for.

11
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:35,534
You okay?

12
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:41,290
I had an interesting conversation
with Louis last night.

13
00:00:42,667 --> 00:00:45,586
He said I should be careful
of you and Rachel.

14
00:00:46,087 --> 00:00:47,629
Do I have anything
to worry about?

15
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:48,839
No.

16
00:00:48,965 --> 00:00:53,260
He hates me. And he's just trying
to get to me through you.

17
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:54,887
So you never...

18
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:56,388
No.

19
00:00:56,931 --> 00:00:58,348
You've got nothing
to worry about.

20
00:00:58,475 --> 00:00:59,808
She's just a friend.

21
00:00:59,934 --> 00:01:02,102
- Okay.
- And I am late.

22
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:05,064
- I'll call.
- Okay.

23
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:10,235
We should go out.

24
00:01:12,113 --> 00:01:13,864
I thought this
is going out.

25
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:15,365
No, I mean, um...

26
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:18,619
You and me and Rachel
should go on a double date.

27
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:20,162
Does she have
a boyfriend?

28
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:22,831
I don't know.

29
00:01:22,957 --> 00:01:23,916
No. I mean...

30
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:26,168
Going on a double date with somebody
from work might be kind of...

31
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:27,628
Weird.

32
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:29,546
If I get to know her,
then I won't worry.

33
00:01:29,839 --> 00:01:30,839
It will be fun.

34
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:34,009
Just a couple of friends
going out, right?

35
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:36,053
Awesome.

36
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:06,708
A cab? Someone steal
your bike?

37
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:08,669
I have a lot on my mind.
It's a safety issue.

38
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:10,462
- What are you talking about?
- Louis.

39
00:02:10,588 --> 00:02:11,713
He told Jenny about
Rachel and me.

40
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,340
It was one kiss,
and she kissed me. I...

41
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:15,592
Okay, Soap Opera, just
give me my documents.

42
00:02:15,718 --> 00:02:17,511
Harvey.

43
00:02:19,013 --> 00:02:20,139
Cameron.

44
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:22,057
How the hell are you?

45
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:23,809
- It's good to see you.
- Wow.

46
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:25,686
Too damn long.

47
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:27,104
Cameron Dennis,
District Attorney.

48
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:28,564
Meet Mike Ross,
my associate.

49
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:29,565
Hi.

50
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:31,650
I guess that makes you
his Harvey.

51
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:34,319
- Sorry?
- Harvey was my associate.

52
00:02:34,445 --> 00:02:35,404
I taught him
everything he knows.

53
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:37,489
Best ADA
to come up since...

54
00:02:38,074 --> 00:02:39,741
- Me.
- You taught him.

55
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:42,161
"Never go to court."

56
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:43,912
That's me.
"It's not about caring,

57
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:46,039
"it's about winning." Me.

58
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:49,084
- No way. Harvey's Harvey.
- Yeah. Exactly.

59
00:02:50,211 --> 00:02:53,046
We should, uh,
catch up. Have lunch.

60
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:55,632
Hey, you know what? This is crazy.
I'm free for dinner tonight.

61
00:02:55,758 --> 00:02:58,802
Just cancel whatever you have and tell
Jessica I demanded

62
00:02:58,928 --> 00:02:59,887
that you clear your schedule.

63
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:02,347
Dinner it is.
It will be nice.

64
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:04,266
That's my boy.

65
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,519
All right. You know where
to find me. 8:00.

66
00:03:07,645 --> 00:03:08,896
Glad I ran
into you, Harvey.

67
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:16,862
It's pretty
good work. Thank you.

68
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:18,363
You're welcome.

69
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:20,407
Ross, you still
work here?

70
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:21,450
- Funny.
- You know, because I thought,

71
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:23,327
- after I beat you...
- Yeah. I got it.

72
00:03:24,078 --> 00:03:25,662
- Thanks for expediting.
- Yeah.

73
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:32,085
Hi.

74
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:36,673
Do you need
something?

75
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,926
Did you know that Harvey,
uh, was a prosecutor?

76
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:41,094
- No, he wasn't.
- Yeah. He was.

77
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:42,095
I've read every
bio at the firm.

78
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,722
People work for the DA's office,
it's on their bio.

79
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:45,349
Well, we ran into Cameron Dennis
this morning.

80
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:47,017
- The DA?
- Yeah.

81
00:03:47,143 --> 00:03:50,103
He says that Harvey's
the best ADA he's ever had.

82
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,563
No. Come here.

83
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:54,274
See? Nothing about
being a prosecutor.

84
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,484
Yeah.

85
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:58,278
I need you to go on a double date
with me and Jenny.

86
00:03:58,404 --> 00:03:59,696
Yeah. Not going
to happen.

87
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:01,740
You have to.
Listen to me.

88
00:04:02,116 --> 00:04:04,076
Louis warned her.
About you and me.

89
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:05,160
What...

90
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:06,662
How did he
even get...

91
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:07,996
You know how.

92
00:04:08,122 --> 00:04:10,082
Because he walked in
right after you kissed me.

93
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:12,876
If you say no, she's going to think
something is going on between us.

94
00:04:13,294 --> 00:04:15,045
Okay. I'll go.

95
00:04:15,838 --> 00:04:18,048
- Thank you.
- Freaking Louis.

96
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:20,842
Oh... Is this Harvey?

97
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:23,512
Okay, you are definitely
sending me that photo.

98
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:26,014
Westlaw lists him
as prosecutor of record

99
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:28,308
on pages
and pages of cases.

100
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:29,393
I told you.

101
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:31,270
I don't get it. Why wouldn't he have
this on his bio?

102
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:33,939
Because, maybe he has
something to hide.

103
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:39,987
See the money,
wanna stay for your meal

104
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:43,115
Get another piece of pie
for your wife

105
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:46,535
Everybody wanna know
how it feel

106
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:49,705
Everybody wanna see
what it's like

107
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:53,000
I'll even eat a bean pie
I don't mind

108
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:54,918
Me and missy is so early

109
00:04:55,044 --> 00:04:56,712
Busy, busy making money

110
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:58,005
All right!

111
00:04:58,423 --> 00:05:03,051
All step back
I'm 'bout to dance

112
00:05:04,178 --> 00:05:05,929
The greenback boogie

113
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,395
"It touches some
idealistic core of your being

114
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:16,982
"where even the greatest cynic
has not given up hope.

115
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:18,650
"That's why we
listen to music."

116
00:05:18,776 --> 00:05:20,027
Oh, that's
beautiful, Louis.

117
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:21,111
Really.

118
00:05:21,237 --> 00:05:22,904
And I think
your decision to leave law

119
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:24,114
to become
a music critic

120
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,657
is in everyone's
best interest.

121
00:05:25,783 --> 00:05:27,284
Okay. I was quoting
Peter Sellars.

122
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:30,370
I just got $1,000 a head tickets
to Nixon in China.

123
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:32,831
Are you two dating now?
Should I come back?

124
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:34,958
Sit down, Harvey.

125
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:37,336
I love it when you talk to me like
my third grade teacher,

126
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:38,754
Mrs. Coe.

127
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:41,506
Gentlemen.

128
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:44,509
Malcolm Price
died last week.

129
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:45,969
Truly great loss
for humanity.

130
00:05:46,095 --> 00:05:48,055
You want to mock
the dead? Fine.

131
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:51,850
But his tabloid, Nothing But The Truth,
has made us a fortune.

132
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:55,854
Price has left his estate,
10 companies

133
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:58,148
including the tabloid,
to his two daughters,

134
00:05:58,274 --> 00:05:59,566
Madison and Kelsey.

135
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:02,110
We have been asked to divide the assets
up fairly.

136
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:03,737
And I'm here why?

137
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:05,030
Because they
hate each other.

138
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:07,366
Malcolm structured the will to bring
them back together.

139
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:12,079
You have a knack for bringing parties
together who don't see eye to eye.

140
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:13,246
So why is he here?

141
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,207
Because Madison Price
requested him.

142
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:17,876
You sure she's not
mixing him up with me?

143
00:06:18,002 --> 00:06:20,212
Hardman had me do some contract work for
her a couple of years back.

144
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:22,047
- So I guess I made an impression.
- Right.

145
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:24,424
So you each
get a sister.

146
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:28,178
You think pitting us against each other
is fair to Louis' client?

147
00:06:28,304 --> 00:06:30,097
Please. Dividing
financial assets?

148
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:32,224
- You couldn't shine my shoes.
- Someone should.

149
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:34,726
Well, actually, I personally shine my
own shoes. So there you go.

150
00:06:34,852 --> 00:06:35,852
Well, lucky them.

151
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:37,687
How come you always ask Donna,
"Donna, by the way,

152
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:39,022
"those are really nice shoes that Louis
has on."

153
00:06:39,148 --> 00:06:40,023
Gentlemen.

154
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:42,651
We're on the
same side.

155
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:47,030
And although I would not
choose to have you both on this,

156
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:49,783
that is how it fell. So...

157
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:55,455
I expect you to put your differences
aside and work together on this,

158
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:57,749
so that everyone
can be happy.

159
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:00,335
Can you manage
that this time?

160
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:06,508
She's always hated me.

161
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:09,511
Well, maybe this is a chance to put
all that behind you.

162
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:11,721
I'd like that.
Really, I would.

163
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:14,182
But Maddie...
I don't think so.

164
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:15,350
Maybe she'll surprise you.

165
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:17,185
Kelsey's a bitch.

166
00:07:17,311 --> 00:07:18,520
She doesn't
deserve any of it.

167
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:22,149
Well, I'm afraid your father didn't
share that point of view.

168
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:25,235
According to his will,
we were meant...

169
00:07:25,361 --> 00:07:28,238
To find a division of these companies
that makes both of you happy.

170
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:29,322
But I want to make
sure that...

171
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:30,407
That you're happy.

172
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:32,242
You want to know what
will make me happy?

173
00:07:32,368 --> 00:07:34,411
Whatever makes her miserable.
It's simple.

174
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:36,997
I want
Nothing But The Truth.

175
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:39,082
My father and I
worked together on it for years and...

176
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:40,667
It made me crazy.

177
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:43,920
The two of them
pretending that tabloid was literature.

178
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:45,714
It means
everything to me.

179
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:46,798
All I want is...

180
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:48,341
To sell off
that piece of garbage

181
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,051
and for her to get
as little as possible.

182
00:07:50,344 --> 00:07:51,636
What made her
so mad at you?

183
00:07:51,762 --> 00:07:55,390
She blames me for our dad leaving her
mother and marrying mine.

184
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:57,267
How can she think
that's your fault?

185
00:07:57,393 --> 00:08:01,563
Because her mother got pregnant, and
used it to rope in my dad.

186
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:04,774
And then, little Kelsey became the
center of his universe.

187
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:09,196
Do you know what's it's like to have
someone hate you out of pure jealousy?

188
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:10,489
We'll get you the paper.

189
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:12,782
Do you know
what it's like?

190
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:14,993
To watch someone else
get all the attention,

191
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:18,205
when you know that you're
twice the person they are?

192
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:20,457
She's not getting
that paper.

193
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,085
- Maddie.
- Kelsey.

194
00:08:24,378 --> 00:08:25,795
- Louis.
- Harvey.

195
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:27,130
- Doctor.
- Doctor.

196
00:08:27,965 --> 00:08:29,424
- Chevy.
- Nice.

197
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:31,801
- Good meeting?
- Yeah, we connected. You?

198
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:33,011
We're on the same page.

199
00:08:33,137 --> 00:08:34,095
Hmm.

200
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:36,139
What was, uh,
Kelsey looking for?

201
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:37,849
I don't know.
Why don't you ask Jenny?

202
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:40,310
You seem to like
talking to her.

203
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:47,192
No, Mike,
that's not distracting.

204
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:49,694
- I was just waiting.
- For what?

205
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:50,820
To not be distracting.

206
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:57,869
How come Harvey doesn't talk about
working for the DA's office?

207
00:08:57,995 --> 00:08:59,829
- Who told you that?
- Cameron Dennis.

208
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:01,122
We ran into him
this morning.

209
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:02,832
They're having
dinner.

210
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,459
So, that's why he wouldn't tell me
where he was going.

211
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:05,627
What's going on,
Donna?

212
00:09:06,837 --> 00:09:07,837
Let it go.

213
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:09,923
Don't ask
Harvey about this.

214
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:11,758
- What's the big secret?
- It's no secret, just...

215
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:14,261
Don't.

216
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,973
And what are we
talking about?

217
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:19,391
The Price sisters.

218
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:20,976
Those girls.

219
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:29,025
Do we really have to play nice with
Louis? I want to crush him.

220
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:30,110
You want to crush him?

221
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:33,530
Get over to the paper, kick the tires,
and figure out what it's worth.

222
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:35,365
I thought we were supposed to use the
independent valuations.

223
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:37,367
What? You think he's going
to play by the rules?

224
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:38,743
I know he won't.

225
00:09:38,869 --> 00:09:40,495
That's why you better be
three steps ahead of him.

226
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:43,081
Because I can guarantee you, Louis will
be two steps ahead of you.

227
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:44,291
Speak of the devil.

228
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:45,959
Her majesty's
here to see you.

229
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:47,335
- I heard that.
- You were meant to.

230
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:48,587
- Gentlemen.
- Your highness.

231
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:50,589
Okay. You know what?
That's exactly why I'm here.

232
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:51,840
To be mocked?

233
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:54,926
No. To set clear ground rules
to keep the negotiation aboveboard.

234
00:09:55,052 --> 00:09:57,804
Absolutely. No kicking, no biting,
and no rabbit punches.

235
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:58,847
And now, you're mocking the ground
rules.

236
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:00,140
No, I'm just mocking you.

237
00:10:00,474 --> 00:10:01,474
Point one.

238
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,602
We both agree to use
the independent valuations.

239
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:05,854
Absolutely. Good point.

240
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,063
Point two.

241
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:09,232
You do not
call Jessica in to mediate.

242
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:10,650
This is you and me.

243
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:12,319
You afraid mom's
going to take my side?

244
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:13,945
No, I know mom's
going to take your side.

245
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:15,905
- Because I'd be right.
- Point three.

246
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:16,906
Chinese wall.

247
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:19,492
You can't access
any internal documents that I create.

248
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:20,577
Let's make
Jessica proud.

249
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:22,829
We do this right,
everyone walks away happy.

250
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:23,913
Wonderful.

251
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:25,749
Don't worry.
We'll still crush him.

252
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,417
- I heard that.
- You were meant to.

253
00:10:33,507 --> 00:10:34,549
Care to make a wager?

254
00:10:34,675 --> 00:10:37,552
Our job is to make both sisters happy.
How do we know who wins?

255
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:38,637
We'll know.

256
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:40,347
Usual amount?

257
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:42,891
No. I think we should change
it up this time.

258
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:44,351
I win, I get Mike.

259
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:47,228
You can't bet me
like I'm chattel, Louis.

260
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:48,772
It's not like
he's going to win.

261
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:49,856
One month.

262
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:50,815
Ten days.

263
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:51,941
- Harvey.
- Two weeks.

264
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:52,901
- Nine days.
- Harvey!

265
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:55,028
All right. You know what?
Fine. Ten days.

266
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:56,821
And in return?

267
00:10:57,823 --> 00:11:00,200
Well, that's tough. Because anything you
have, I wouldn't want.

268
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:03,828
What, uh...
You're going to bet me for nothing?

269
00:11:18,302 --> 00:11:19,302
Harvey?

270
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:21,971
Harvey Specter.

271
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:24,432
Alexandra Leeds.

272
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:26,476
I hear you're working for the Attorney
General's office.

273
00:11:26,602 --> 00:11:28,269
And you're fighting
for the oppressive capitalists.

274
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,230
Winning for the
oppressive capitalists.

275
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:32,399
Good for you.
We should have lunch.

276
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:33,525
Catch up.

277
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:36,945
Who told you I was
coming here tonight?

278
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:38,238
No one.

279
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:41,700
I haven't seen you in five years.
You want to catch up?

280
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:44,285
You want something from me.
And it isn't lunch.

281
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:47,038
I want to talk about
Cameron Dennis.

282
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:50,417
Six feet.
Pisces. Wavy hair.

283
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:51,584
I'm serious.

284
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:55,255
I haven't worked for Cameron in over a
decade. What's there to talk about?

285
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,841
The Attorney General's
investigating allegations

286
00:11:57,967 --> 00:12:01,803
that he systematically buried
evidence to get convictions.

287
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:04,055
So, talk to people
who actually work with the guy.

288
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:06,933
Yeah, that's the problem. He's still
their boss. Nobody is talking.

289
00:12:07,351 --> 00:12:11,187
Neither am I. Over lunch or anywhere
else. So, best of luck.

290
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:12,647
Harvey.

291
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:15,316
I was hoping
for some lunch.

292
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:19,821
I'm having you
subpoenaed.

293
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:21,531
To testify before
a grand jury.

294
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:24,117
Enjoy your dinner.
Give Cameron my best.

295
00:12:35,963 --> 00:12:38,923
Hey. Harvey.
Glad you could make it. How are you?

296
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:41,426
Tell me about the bullshit run-in that
you staged this morning.

297
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:43,011
How long did you have to wait so that
you could pretend

298
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:45,597
to be surprised to see me?

299
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:46,681
Ten minutes.

300
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:49,267
You're never early, but I didn't want
to cut it too close.

301
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:52,729
Well, I also just had another little
run-in with Alexandra Leeds.

302
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,607
You really want to
drag me into this?

303
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:59,444
Calm down, Harvey. I'm not dragging
you into anything.

304
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:00,820
They're dragging me
into this.

305
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:03,239
It's election year nonsense,
and I wanted to warn you.

306
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:05,575
So you asked me
here to warn me?

307
00:13:05,701 --> 00:13:09,287
Yeah, and to reassure myself that
you've got my back.

308
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:11,122
How bad is it?

309
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:13,917
It's nothing I can't handle,
but I'm glad you're here.

310
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:16,127
Look, Harvey.

311
00:13:16,253 --> 00:13:19,589
Whatever differences we had,
we were a good team.

312
00:13:19,715 --> 00:13:21,216
The truth is that,

313
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:25,512
if anything taints
the work that we did,

314
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:27,096
it will be bad
for both of us.

315
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:28,556
Is that a threat?

316
00:13:28,682 --> 00:13:31,100
Not at all.
It's just reality.

317
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:32,685
We put away
bad people, Harvey.

318
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:34,646
We fought tough battles
and we won.

319
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:36,189
I taught you
how to win.

320
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:37,732
That's not exactly what
you taught me, though.

321
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:40,151
I know that you didn't
always approve of the means,

322
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:43,196
but we both know that the end result
was always right.

323
00:13:44,698 --> 00:13:46,282
You're still the best
smooth talker I know.

324
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:49,244
Use it now. Talk your way out
of this. Settle.

325
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:51,996
Because if this goes to court, there are
skeletons to be found.

326
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:54,499
They won't find them.

327
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:56,042
You want to
bank on that?

328
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:57,502
I have your back.

329
00:13:57,628 --> 00:13:59,212
I am not
volunteering anything.

330
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:02,006
But if push comes to shove,
I won't perjure myself.

331
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:05,218
Not even for you.

332
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:21,901
How was dinner
with the Antichrist?

333
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:26,865
Subpoena came for you.

334
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:30,702
What are you
going to do?

335
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:32,078
What would you do?

336
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:35,790
I'm sorry.
Are you feeling okay?

337
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:37,458
You just asked
my advice.

338
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:39,752
All these years?
Yeah, that's a first.

339
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,087
You were there.
What would you do?

340
00:14:41,463 --> 00:14:42,463
I'd tell them
everything.

341
00:14:43,507 --> 00:14:44,924
I'd watch Cameron
go down.

342
00:14:45,342 --> 00:14:47,010
I'd throw a party,
I'd drink champagne,

343
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:49,429
I'd go to bed, and I'd sleep like a
baby after I did it.

344
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:51,514
Really?
Don't equivocate.

345
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,849
He's poison, Harvey.

346
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:54,183
Leaving there
was huge.

347
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:55,852
You could have gone
down a dark road.

348
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:58,062
And I am telling you,
I would not have followed.

349
00:14:58,188 --> 00:15:00,064
I just got back
from the paper.

350
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:02,025
This place,
it's a growing asset.

351
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:04,068
There's opportunity
for expansion.

352
00:15:04,194 --> 00:15:07,405
If we get this thing for Kelsey,
I think she's set.

353
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:10,491
I saw Elvis there.

354
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:11,618
Great.

355
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:13,286
That's exciting.

356
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:16,080
Am I interrupting
something?

357
00:15:17,124 --> 00:15:19,292
- Dinner didn't go well?
- It was okay.

358
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:20,919
Old times.

359
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:22,629
If that's how you
want to play it.

360
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,547
Let's talk about
this proposal for Louis.

361
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:27,175
You know what? Why don't you
take a run at it?

362
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:28,718
Get the best
deal you can.

363
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:31,804
You bet me, and now, you're hanging
me out to dry?

364
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,723
That's fine. I'll do it.
And I'll win.

365
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:38,019
Oh, did you decide what you want him
to pay you when I win?

366
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:39,896
His tickets to
Nixon in China.

367
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:41,481
You want to go
to the opera?

368
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:44,233
No, but Louis does. And making him miss
it will be amusing.

369
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:45,485
So you get nothing.

370
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:47,362
You are betting me
for nothing.

371
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:49,030
- Are you still talking?
- Right.

372
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,873
- So, did you find a date for tonight?
- Yep.

373
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:02,043
And?

374
00:16:02,586 --> 00:16:03,795
And we'll
see you there.

375
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:05,213
What?

376
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,340
I thought that's what
you said you wanted.

377
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:10,927
To sit with you and Jenny and have her
seeing into my brain the whole time?

378
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:13,012
Seeing what?

379
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:16,182
You do remember
that we kissed, right?

380
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:17,767
I remember.

381
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:20,895
It will be okay.

382
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:39,038
Hi. Uh, is this a good time to talk
about division of assets?

383
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:40,123
No.

384
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:43,960
Is there a
better time, or...

385
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:46,087
Yes.
When Harvey's available.

386
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,089
Harvey asked me
to handle it.

387
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:52,635
- He thinks you can beat me?
- Prove him wrong.

388
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:54,095
What's there to lose?

389
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:56,180
Except for Nixon in China,
of course.

390
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:57,974
What do you have for me?

391
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:01,102
Okay. So, there
are 10 companies.

392
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:06,941
We propose that Kelsey takes companies
one, three, seven, and nine.

393
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:08,776
So that gives us...

394
00:17:08,902 --> 00:17:10,486
52.3% of the assets.

395
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:12,113
Hmm. Generous.
But, no.

396
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:14,866
Uh...

397
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:17,452
Alternatively, we propose that Kelsey
takes companies

398
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:20,204
one, two, four, and eight.

399
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:21,205
That gives you...

400
00:17:21,331 --> 00:17:23,499
54.6%. No.

401
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:25,626
Do you have a
counterproposal, or...

402
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:27,003
No.

403
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:31,632
Okay. Uh, Kelsey takes companies
one, seven, eight, and nine.

404
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:32,675
- No.
- Louis, that gives you

405
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:34,093
60% of the assets.

406
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:36,137
Yes. But, no.

407
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:39,557
What is it your
client wants?

408
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:47,023
Well, your offer makes it infinitely
clear what your client wants.

409
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:48,149
The tabloid.

410
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:51,944
And what my client wants is for your
client to not get what she wants.

411
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,530
So, you can't have
the tabloid. Period.

412
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:57,533
You are legally required
to take these offers to your client.

413
00:17:57,659 --> 00:17:59,118
So, bring me up
on ethics charges.

414
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:01,204
Or report me
to your supervisor.

415
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:03,623
Oh, wait. Shit.
I am your supervisor.

416
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,792
Hold on one second.

417
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:10,797
Go ahead.

418
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:13,049
What are your
complaints?

419
00:18:13,675 --> 00:18:15,093
Have any?
No? Really?

420
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:22,433
We're supposed to find a fair and
equitable settlement, Louis.

421
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,310
Well, then, you go
run and tell Jessica.

422
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:26,270
Oh, wait. That would
be breaking the rules.

423
00:18:26,396 --> 00:18:27,563
And then you'd have
to come work for me.

424
00:18:27,689 --> 00:18:29,398
So why don't you run along now
and get Harvey

425
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:32,401
and tell him to get off his ass and join
the negotiations.

426
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:33,611
Because you
just failed.

427
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,367
When you left the DA's office,
you said you were done.

428
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:41,953
You had learned enough.
And that you were ready to move on.

429
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:43,412
Was that just bullshit?

430
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:45,623
You were the one
who wanted me to have trial experience.

431
00:18:45,749 --> 00:18:47,959
You said that Cameron was the only one
that I should learn from.

432
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:49,877
And what exactly
did he teach you?

433
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:52,588
Harvey,
why did you leave?

434
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:55,174
He had a case.

435
00:18:55,926 --> 00:18:59,053
I caught him burying a key piece of
evidence he was obligated to turn over.

436
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:03,099
The guy was guilty. The defense would
have used it to let him walk.

437
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:04,934
All right. What kind
of exposure do you have?

438
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,519
I told him no.
He didn't listen.

439
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:08,020
Then, you were obligated
to report him.

440
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:09,230
Which is why I left.

441
00:19:09,356 --> 00:19:10,898
Why didn't you tell me this
at the time?

442
00:19:11,024 --> 00:19:13,109
Because you put me there,
Jessica. To be mentored.

443
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:15,736
Okay. And it occurred to me, that might
have been exactly

444
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:18,364
what you wanted me to learn.

445
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,741
For the record,
it wasn't.

446
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:23,911
I'm going to represent you
at this deposition.

447
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:27,039
I'm going to try to
keep you from talking.

448
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,959
But I think you should.

449
00:19:32,087 --> 00:19:34,380
- He was my mentor.
- He is a public servant.

450
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:36,924
- He was my mentor.
- The standards are higher.

451
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:38,551
He was my mentor.

452
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:40,887
And I am not going to be the one
to expose him

453
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:42,930
any more than
I'd ever turn on you.

454
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:58,070
Worst dating story...

455
00:19:58,197 --> 00:19:59,488
Identical twins.

456
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:01,574
I was a lab rat for their
social experiment.

457
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,701
They were trying to prove
that women were shallow

458
00:20:03,952 --> 00:20:05,161
and can't see
beyond the surface.

459
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:06,787
And they wanted
to get laid.

460
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:08,080
Yes. That, too.

461
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:09,707
Good times.

462
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:12,126
So you slept
with them both.

463
00:20:12,252 --> 00:20:13,502
Almost.

464
00:20:13,837 --> 00:20:16,672
Turns out they weren't
identical after all.

465
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:20,927
Wow. Excuse me. I am just going to run
to the ladies' room.

466
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:22,470
- Oh, I'll go with you.
- Okay.

467
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:31,687
What's wrong, Mikey?
Tough day at the office?

468
00:20:31,813 --> 00:20:33,564
Didn't see you.
It could have been worse.

469
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:34,649
That's good.

470
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:37,568
So, you and Rachel. How long have you
guys been dating?

471
00:20:37,694 --> 00:20:42,031
You know how lawyers and clients grow
close over the course of a trial.

472
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:44,450
When we kicked your
ass in the mock trial,

473
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:45,910
we, uh...

474
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:47,328
Bonded.

475
00:20:48,455 --> 00:20:50,206
You know, in the real world, dating
clients

476
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:51,624
is a
violation of ethics. Right?

477
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,459
Good thing it's not
the real world.

478
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:57,755
Because I intend to violate those
ethics all night.

479
00:20:58,048 --> 00:20:59,465
You know
the funny thing?

480
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:02,510
I always thought
you'd get there first.

481
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,304
- I'll tell you how she is.
- Shut up, Kyle.

482
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:06,889
Someone might think
you're jealous.

483
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:08,349
Someone might think
you're a dick.

484
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:11,519
Oh, wait.
Somebody already does.

485
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:13,104
That's good.
You should write that one down.

486
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:15,064
- Do you keep a journal of these things?
- Just finish your tofu.

487
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:17,608
- So, how did you two meet?
- Um...

488
00:21:19,736 --> 00:21:21,570
I dated his best friend.

489
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:27,076
I know. It's awful. But he was a bad guy
and I didn't see it.

490
00:21:28,912 --> 00:21:29,912
Mike showed me.

491
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:32,206
The truth is, I...

492
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:34,583
I think there was always
something there with us.

493
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:37,461
But nothing happened until Trevor and I
were totally done.

494
00:21:37,587 --> 00:21:38,546
Never?

495
00:21:39,923 --> 00:21:41,632
Well, we did
kiss once.

496
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:49,932
Hey.
Having fun?

497
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:51,309
Loads. Right, Mike?

498
00:21:51,435 --> 00:21:52,393
I think we're
going to go.

499
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:55,104
- What? No. We're having fun. Come on.
- Yeah. I'm just tired.

500
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:56,522
- Yeah.
- Kyle, really. Just...

501
00:21:57,232 --> 00:21:58,357
Okay. Kyle, just,
you know...

502
00:21:58,483 --> 00:21:59,734
What?
What's your problem?

503
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,652
Stop it.
She doesn't like it.

504
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,956
Oh, my God. That guy is
such a tool.

505
00:22:14,082 --> 00:22:16,042
So what? He's not
your date.

506
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:17,293
Yeah? Well, I have
to work with him.

507
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:18,794
That's not why
it bothers you.

508
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,087
It's because he's with Rachel
and you know it.

509
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:22,089
Oh, my God. Jenny,
we've been over this.

510
00:22:22,215 --> 00:22:24,258
I've seen the way
you look at her.

511
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:27,136
I've seen it before.

512
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:31,766
It's the way you used to look at me
when I was with Trevor.

513
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:33,225
- Jenny, I...
- I'm going home, Mike.

514
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:36,062
Decide what you want.

515
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:37,730
In or out.

516
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:39,231
I like you.

517
00:22:40,984 --> 00:22:42,151
A lot.

518
00:22:45,238 --> 00:22:46,989
But you can't
have both.

519
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:57,500
I worked as an
Assistant District Attorney

520
00:22:57,626 --> 00:22:59,543
for the County of New York
for two years.

521
00:22:59,669 --> 00:23:01,712
Tell me about your relationship
with Cameron Dennis.

522
00:23:01,838 --> 00:23:02,963
Vague.

523
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:08,386
Did you and District Attorney
Cameron Dennis work closely together?

524
00:23:09,137 --> 00:23:11,180
He was my boss.
He supervised all my cases.

525
00:23:11,306 --> 00:23:13,015
And were you
personally close?

526
00:23:13,141 --> 00:23:15,142
- Subjective.
- A judge would allow it.

527
00:23:15,268 --> 00:23:17,937
And yet, there's
not one here.

528
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:20,231
Do you really think,
by deposing him on the stand,

529
00:23:20,357 --> 00:23:21,607
you're going to
intimidate him?

530
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:24,735
I think deposing him here
will let him know what it will be like

531
00:23:24,861 --> 00:23:26,862
if this evidence
is brought forward at trial.

532
00:23:26,988 --> 00:23:28,864
You're not
getting to trial.

533
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:32,952
If your client doesn't perjure himself
right now, I won't have to.

534
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:36,122
Were you and Cameron
Dennis close? Personally?

535
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:39,667
He was my mentor. That's a hard
relationship to define.

536
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:41,085
Moving on, Counselor.

537
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:45,214
All right. We don't have to talk
about Mr. Dennis.

538
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:48,008
Let's talk about you,
Mr. Specter.

539
00:23:48,468 --> 00:23:53,097
In two years,
you handled 18,362 cases.

540
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:56,350
Thirty-six cases a day.
That's beyond impressive.

541
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:58,060
Thank you.

542
00:23:58,186 --> 00:24:00,855
You took 147 to trial,
winning them all.

543
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:03,732
Don't go to trial if you're not
going to win.

544
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:05,151
Why did you leave?

545
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:07,278
An attorney by the name of Jessica
Pearson

546
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:09,071
helped me get through law school.

547
00:24:09,197 --> 00:24:12,241
And she felt that I could use
trial experience.

548
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:17,204
But I always planned
on ending up at her firm

549
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:20,875
and paying her back by earning that firm
outrageous settlements.

550
00:24:21,251 --> 00:24:23,252
- How am I doing?
- Could do better.

551
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:25,463
You two think
that this is a joke.

552
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:26,589
Argumentative.

553
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:28,424
You're damn right
it's argumentative.

554
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:29,967
Because he knows that
laws have been broken,

555
00:24:30,093 --> 00:24:33,053
- and he has an obligation to report it.
- Miss Leeds...

556
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,263
But if this is the way
you want to play it,

557
00:24:34,389 --> 00:24:38,100
the Attorney General has given me a
broad mandate to uncover what went on.

558
00:24:38,435 --> 00:24:41,020
And it need not be limited
to Mr. Dennis.

559
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:43,939
Were you part of
the problem, Mr. Specter?

560
00:24:44,065 --> 00:24:44,940
Vague.

561
00:24:45,066 --> 00:24:46,025
I'll rephrase.

562
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:50,488
In your capacity as Assistant District
Attorney in the County of New York,

563
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:54,617
did you knowingly suppress evidence in
violation of the ABA Rules of Conduct,

564
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:56,118
the NDAA Standards,

565
00:24:56,244 --> 00:24:58,871
and the New York State
Bar Rule 8.4, Section C?

566
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:03,167
My client would like to exercise his
Fifth Amendment rights at this time.

567
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:13,093
I hear you botched the settlement by
negotiating against yourself.

568
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:14,136
I didn't...

569
00:25:14,262 --> 00:25:17,181
You let Louis know the one thing that
was most important to our client.

570
00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:20,059
Yes, I made a mistake.
But Louis made one, too.

571
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:21,268
Well, he didn't
mention that.

572
00:25:21,394 --> 00:25:22,853
Yes, he knows what our client
wants.

573
00:25:22,979 --> 00:25:24,897
But now, we know the
one thing his client wants.

574
00:25:25,148 --> 00:25:26,899
She doesn't care
about winning, Harvey.

575
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:29,068
She just wants
our client to lose.

576
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:32,154
Okay. Well, that's good.
So what's next?

577
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,073
We lose.
We give her the tabloid.

578
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:35,449
Well, how does that
make our client happy?

579
00:25:35,575 --> 00:25:36,951
We let Madison
have the paper.

580
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:39,703
And then, we take everyone who works
there and we start a new one.

581
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:42,957
They all love Kelsey.
Nothing But The Truth is just a name.

582
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:44,458
We let Madison
have it.

583
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,336
I have taught you
a thing or two.

584
00:25:47,462 --> 00:25:51,173
Well, I see that
you're up to speed. Well, as am I.

585
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:54,093
Um... I noticed there were
some employee issues at the tabloid.

586
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:55,636
You know, contracts
about to expire.

587
00:25:55,762 --> 00:25:57,054
So, I just want
to let you guys know

588
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:59,974
that I, uh, went ahead and locked up
all the key employees.

589
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:02,518
Just to protect us.
Since we're all

590
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:05,604
working on this
together. Right?

591
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:07,439
- Mmm-hmm.
- Good.

592
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:12,528
- He knows.
- He can't.

593
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:13,612
- He does.
- I was careful.

594
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:15,197
I deleted
every file from the server.

595
00:26:15,323 --> 00:26:16,699
The only time any paper trail

596
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:19,201
left my locked desk is when
I faxed it to Kelsey.

597
00:26:19,494 --> 00:26:21,245
Oh, you faxed it.
From the large machine

598
00:26:21,371 --> 00:26:24,331
that stores all the information you put
in it to be printed back later

599
00:26:24,457 --> 00:26:26,208
- by anyone who has your code?
- He can't do that.

600
00:26:26,334 --> 00:26:29,169
We have a
Chinese wall thingy.

601
00:26:29,296 --> 00:26:30,546
Oh, God. He's going
to beat us, isn't he?

602
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:31,672
Look. He knows what we're up to,

603
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:34,466
but he couldn't
keep his tactics to himself.

604
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:35,634
So, we can use
that against him.

605
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,511
And that's how
we'll crush Louis.

606
00:26:38,221 --> 00:26:41,515
Refresher course, Harvey. You and Louis
aren't opponents on this one.

607
00:26:41,641 --> 00:26:43,225
You're working together.

608
00:26:43,643 --> 00:26:44,768
Like Captain & Tennille?

609
00:26:45,312 --> 00:26:46,604
Well, if so, he's Tennille.

610
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:47,605
Who?

611
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:52,109
You need to
come with me.

612
00:26:52,235 --> 00:26:55,195
- What, am I in trouble?
- Yeah, Harvey. You are.

613
00:27:06,082 --> 00:27:08,042
You going to buy me a drink before
you screw me?

614
00:27:08,168 --> 00:27:10,919
Sit down, Harvey. Listen to what
she has to say.

615
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:14,340
You've got me
trembling in my boots.

616
00:27:17,218 --> 00:27:20,012
You're a small fish, and you don't even
swim in the pond anymore.

617
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:23,223
But if I have to eat you alive to get to
Cameron Dennis, I will.

618
00:27:24,684 --> 00:27:26,060
This is my case
against him.

619
00:27:26,436 --> 00:27:29,730
Falsifying DNA tests.
Coerced confessions.

620
00:27:29,856 --> 00:27:31,607
Testimony buried.

621
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:34,193
If you have all this,
why do you need me?

622
00:27:35,695 --> 00:27:37,321
Because this is
circumstantial.

623
00:27:37,447 --> 00:27:40,074
You have the crimes, but you can't
physically tie them to Cameron.

624
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:44,036
He's a dirty public servant.
And I think it's why you left.

625
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:46,163
Your record was too good
to just walk away.

626
00:27:46,289 --> 00:27:47,748
- Maybe I got greedy.
- Harvey.

627
00:27:47,874 --> 00:27:49,917
- I'm not testifying.
- You're being stubborn.

628
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:53,253
And this isn't one where
you get to make the call.

629
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:55,089
I'm sorry.

630
00:27:56,841 --> 00:27:58,300
I've done all I can.

631
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:01,637
It wasn't just his cases
he cheated on.

632
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:04,306
Hector Avila.
Take a look.

633
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:06,183
You think you were
really that great?

634
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:09,895
You think your great track record was
because of your skill?

635
00:28:10,397 --> 00:28:13,148
I've got two theories
here, Harvey.

636
00:28:13,274 --> 00:28:14,316
Either you're
wasting your time

637
00:28:14,442 --> 00:28:16,318
protecting a man who screwed you
from the beginning,

638
00:28:16,444 --> 00:28:18,904
or you didn't just
know he did this.

639
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:22,408
You participated. In which case,
I'll have you disbarred.

640
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:36,714
Come on.
Come on. Damn it.

641
00:28:38,174 --> 00:28:39,133
What are you doing?

642
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:42,636
Uh, nothing. I'm just sending some
faxes.

643
00:28:43,638 --> 00:28:45,013
Stand down.

644
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:49,143
They're stuck, Donna.
What are you going to do?

645
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:51,770
I'm the fax whisperer.

646
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:54,189
Okay.
That's ridiculous, right?

647
00:28:54,315 --> 00:28:57,359
I've tried everything. I hit... I've
already done that, and it didn't...

648
00:28:59,195 --> 00:29:00,195
Whatever.

649
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:02,740
United International
wants to buy the tabloid?

650
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:04,825
Ah. Whatever you do,
don't say anything to Louis.

651
00:29:04,951 --> 00:29:07,244
Kelsey Price does
not want to sell.

652
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:09,621
- Not a word.
- Thanks.

653
00:29:24,345 --> 00:29:25,345
Whoa.

654
00:29:25,472 --> 00:29:27,389
Something
explode in here?

655
00:29:28,057 --> 00:29:29,892
Just doing
some research.

656
00:29:30,018 --> 00:29:33,353
Yeah. Because you always
do your own research.

657
00:29:34,397 --> 00:29:38,442
Okay. Closed-door meeting with Donna,
with Jessica...

658
00:29:38,568 --> 00:29:41,779
Dinner with some DA you've
never even mentioned before. Is this...

659
00:29:42,864 --> 00:29:44,782
All something
Cameron Dennis taught you?

660
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:46,492
Keep secrets from everyone because
you're so good,

661
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:47,826
you don't need anyone's help?

662
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:50,788
There's an investigation
into evidence tampering.

663
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:54,166
I've been asked to testify
against my old boss.

664
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:56,251
Or face charges myself.

665
00:29:57,921 --> 00:29:59,171
You could be
disbarred?

666
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:04,009
If I'm found guilty.

667
00:30:04,385 --> 00:30:05,803
Are you guilty?

668
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:09,306
Not of evidence tampering.
I would never do that.

669
00:30:09,432 --> 00:30:10,599
Of anything else?

670
00:30:10,725 --> 00:30:13,727
Anything I ever did, you put me in front
of an unbiased judge,

671
00:30:13,853 --> 00:30:14,937
I walk away clean.

672
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:17,981
You put me in a courtroom
with a grand jury?

673
00:30:18,107 --> 00:30:19,233
Anything can happen.

674
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:21,527
So, are you
going to testify?

675
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:23,237
I'm not sure
what choice I have.

676
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:26,865
Well, some dickhead
once told me that,

677
00:30:27,951 --> 00:30:31,453
when they put a gun to your head, it's
not just give in or be killed.

678
00:30:31,579 --> 00:30:33,622
There are 146
other options.

679
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:37,709
You'll figure
something out.

680
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:41,755
I'll have a proposal
for you in the morning.

681
00:30:41,881 --> 00:30:43,257
And I think
we'll all be happy.

682
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:44,842
All right?

683
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:46,260
Night.

684
00:30:49,055 --> 00:30:50,138
He took the bait?

685
00:30:50,265 --> 00:30:52,307
Like shooting
fish in a barrel.

686
00:30:52,433 --> 00:30:53,392
Good work.

687
00:30:57,063 --> 00:30:58,605
Where you going?

688
00:30:58,731 --> 00:31:00,941
I just might
take your advice.

689
00:31:21,087 --> 00:31:24,298
Well, the tides are turning.
Are you turning with them, Harvey?

690
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:25,966
Did they turn you?

691
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:28,635
Hector Avila.

692
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:31,013
You don't even
know, do you?

693
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:32,931
This is some old case?

694
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:35,809
It's my old case.
And you buried evidence.

695
00:31:35,935 --> 00:31:37,561
You wearing a wire,
Harvey?

696
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:41,481
No, you're not.

697
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:42,900
I can tell.

698
00:31:43,026 --> 00:31:44,902
I'm not that easy
to read anymore, Cameron.

699
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:46,778
You are to me.

700
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:48,113
Hector Avila.

701
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:49,698
Was he guilty,
whoever he was?

702
00:31:49,824 --> 00:31:51,658
- It was my case.
- Guilty is guilty.

703
00:31:51,784 --> 00:31:52,826
That's not the way
the system works.

704
00:31:52,952 --> 00:31:54,912
The system is broken
and you know it.

705
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:56,163
It's not reasonable doubt.

706
00:31:56,289 --> 00:31:58,540
Juries want to be sure
without a shadow of a doubt.

707
00:31:58,666 --> 00:32:01,293
- It was my case.
- You worked for me.

708
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:03,128
They were all my cases.

709
00:32:04,964 --> 00:32:06,089
You're a disappointment.

710
00:32:06,841 --> 00:32:08,967
No. You're the
disappointment.

711
00:32:09,218 --> 00:32:10,844
You could have been
DA yourself.

712
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:14,097
You are twice the lawyer than any of the
pricks lined up to run against me.

713
00:32:14,223 --> 00:32:15,098
But you sold out.

714
00:32:15,224 --> 00:32:17,517
You help rich people keep their money.
That's all you do.

715
00:32:17,644 --> 00:32:22,230
I stack my value to society against
yours and I win by a mile.

716
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:27,110
So you're selling me out?

717
00:32:27,236 --> 00:32:31,156
We both know they don't want to put you
in jail. That's not what this is about.

718
00:32:31,282 --> 00:32:33,033
Walk away, Cameron.
Make a deal.

719
00:32:33,159 --> 00:32:36,662
Let someone else be DA, and all of this?
It goes away.

720
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:39,289
Otherwise? You know
what happens if you talk.

721
00:32:39,415 --> 00:32:41,291
They start
reopening cases.

722
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:43,085
Maybe Hector Avila
walks away.

723
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:45,128
He murdered once.
He'll murder again.

724
00:32:45,254 --> 00:32:46,505
You do remember him,
don't you?

725
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:47,923
Oh, I remember them all.

726
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:52,302
Maxwell Rankin? What was it, uh,
34 or 35 women that he raped?

727
00:32:52,428 --> 00:32:56,264
Alberto Plank? You remember him?
He burned his children alive?

728
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:58,600
You'll open the floodgates, Harvey.
You want that on your conscience?

729
00:32:58,726 --> 00:33:03,105
Then, make a deal. It's on you to
keep them in jail.

730
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,649
Okay.

731
00:33:08,778 --> 00:33:10,320
Okay, Harvey.

732
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:12,489
You win.

733
00:33:12,865 --> 00:33:14,574
This isn't winning.

734
00:33:16,786 --> 00:33:20,122
Good to see you, Harvey.
Let's do it again soon.

735
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:31,174
So your client is really willing to give
Madison Nothing But The Truth?

736
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:33,093
You made it clear
it was non-negotiable.

737
00:33:33,219 --> 00:33:36,304
I convinced my client
to settle, and...

738
00:33:37,098 --> 00:33:38,181
She wants
to move on.

739
00:33:38,474 --> 00:33:42,227
You sure there isn't anything that you
want to, uh, disclose?

740
00:33:43,062 --> 00:33:45,147
Nope.
I think we're good.

741
00:33:47,775 --> 00:33:49,109
Then, we're good.

742
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:54,322
Everybody's happy.

743
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:55,490
Mmm-hmm.

744
00:33:56,492 --> 00:33:57,492
As clams.

745
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:03,415
Thank you, Louis.

746
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:07,961
You, um...
Happy with the deal?

747
00:34:08,463 --> 00:34:11,298
Yeah. As a matter
of fact, I am. You?

748
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:17,512
You don't even know
the half of it.

749
00:34:17,638 --> 00:34:18,889
Don't I?

750
00:34:19,515 --> 00:34:20,390
Are you happy that your client

751
00:34:20,516 --> 00:34:24,436
got the paper or that you
turned around and sold it?

752
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:28,190
You didn't think
I knew about that, did you?

753
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:31,151
You want to know
why I'm happy, Louis?

754
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:35,113
I'm happy because when you read over
that offer from United International,

755
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:37,199
I wanted you
to read that.

756
00:34:37,533 --> 00:34:39,743
I wanted you
to sell to them.

757
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:43,121
Because the thing you didn't know
is that yesterday,

758
00:34:43,247 --> 00:34:45,582
Kelsey Price bought
United International.

759
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:49,544
You shouldn't go behind
people's backs, Louis.

760
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:53,632
You shouldn't try and access information
that's none of your business.

761
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:55,759
- It could backfire.
- Mmm.

762
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:03,308
I think we need
to talk to Harvey.

763
00:35:04,977 --> 00:35:07,062
- I'm sorry, Harvey.
- You set me up.

764
00:35:07,563 --> 00:35:09,648
No, Louis.
You set yourself up.

765
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:13,151
The sales offer was meaningless
until you read it.

766
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:14,236
This is cheating.

767
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:17,697
You cheated, Louis.

768
00:35:17,824 --> 00:35:20,200
You broke the rules,
and you have to pay the price.

769
00:35:20,326 --> 00:35:24,121
People may think that lawyers will do
anything. That they can do anything.

770
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:26,331
Now, I'm not willing
to accept that. Okay?

771
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:28,917
You can't go skirting
the rules and justify it

772
00:35:29,043 --> 00:35:31,169
because you think
someone else broke the rules.

773
00:35:31,295 --> 00:35:35,841
Okay? You cheated, and you lost.
End of story.

774
00:35:43,182 --> 00:35:46,226
Harvey, I won.

775
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:52,107
His playacting by the fax machine?
That was so obvious.

776
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:54,276
I found out Kelsey owned
United International.

777
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:56,069
I thought, "If they wanted the paper so
badly,

778
00:35:56,195 --> 00:35:58,196
how much would they overpay for it?"

779
00:35:58,322 --> 00:35:59,406
50%.

780
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:05,120
Harvey, you overpaid 50% for a business
so buried in expenses

781
00:36:05,246 --> 00:36:08,540
from the employee deals that I made that
it can barely stay afloat.

782
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:11,793
And then, all I had to do was convince
Madison to sit back,

783
00:36:11,919 --> 00:36:14,921
have fun, watch her sister
fail miserably. I won.

784
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:18,717
Your client got what she wanted.
So did ours.

785
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:19,968
Jessica asked
to make everyone happy.

786
00:36:20,094 --> 00:36:22,387
Everyone's happy.
It's a draw.

787
00:36:23,931 --> 00:36:26,641
Just hold on a second.
You tell me the truth right now.

788
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:31,521
- Is this a win to you?
- Fine, Louis. You win.

789
00:36:31,647 --> 00:36:34,065
You were a step ahead.
You got Mike. Ten days.

790
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,359
You think
I want him now?

791
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:39,779
I just wiped
the floor with him.

792
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:54,002
How can I help you?

793
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:56,254
I'm not going to let him take the fall
for that asshole.

794
00:36:58,007 --> 00:36:59,007
Have a seat.

795
00:37:05,181 --> 00:37:07,432
Harvey didn't see it
for a long time.

796
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:09,559
I mean, Cameron's good
when he wants to be.

797
00:37:09,685 --> 00:37:12,812
You know how I judge
a man's character?

798
00:37:12,939 --> 00:37:17,234
Not by how he treats his equals, but by
how he treats the underlings.

799
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:19,152
The lowest rungs
on the ladder.

800
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:23,114
You always impressed me
in that regard.

801
00:37:24,283 --> 00:37:25,367
Thank you.

802
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:30,956
Harvey would never use that, and
he'd kill me if he knew I had it.

803
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:32,624
But, can you
help him?

804
00:37:35,211 --> 00:37:37,462
Can you use this
to help him?

805
00:37:51,978 --> 00:37:53,853
Is Harvey punishing
you for something?

806
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:56,898
- Louis.
- No. You lost?

807
00:37:57,024 --> 00:37:58,149
You have to
work for him?

808
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:01,695
I lost. And then, he said he didn't want
me. He farmed me out.

809
00:38:01,821 --> 00:38:04,990
Oh, I'm so sorry. Is there anything
I can do to help?

810
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:09,035
What?

811
00:38:10,913 --> 00:38:12,038
That.

812
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:14,499
What are you
talking about?

813
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:20,630
I wanted you for months,

814
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:24,801
Rachel. I flirted. I... I... I made up
some scheme where we were married.

815
00:38:24,927 --> 00:38:26,553
And you made it clear.

816
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:29,514
You don't date
anyone from the office.

817
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:30,807
Until I start seeing
someone else...

818
00:38:30,933 --> 00:38:32,309
Okay. You're delusional.

819
00:38:33,352 --> 00:38:35,186
Why did you bring
Kyle on that date?

820
00:38:35,604 --> 00:38:36,563
Because it was last-minute

821
00:38:36,689 --> 00:38:38,356
and because you needed me to
help convince your girlfriend

822
00:38:38,482 --> 00:38:39,941
that you don't like me.

823
00:38:40,067 --> 00:38:41,943
You did it
to get to me.

824
00:38:42,069 --> 00:38:43,069
This is crazy.
It's just stupid.

825
00:38:43,195 --> 00:38:44,988
You don't even
like the guy, Rachel.

826
00:38:46,032 --> 00:38:49,826
Jenny comes to drop off a suit at the
office, and what do you do?

827
00:38:49,952 --> 00:38:50,869
You kissed me.

828
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:53,330
You know, I seem to recall you
kissing me, too.

829
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:56,458
Yeah. That's the problem.
I did and it was great.

830
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:57,542
But it's too late.

831
00:38:58,377 --> 00:38:59,711
You were too late.

832
00:38:59,837 --> 00:39:01,713
- And I can't do any of this.
- Do what?

833
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:04,758
This. This... This... You joking about
your first time.

834
00:39:04,884 --> 00:39:07,552
Or... Or rubbing my shoulders or...
Or touching my arm.

835
00:39:08,763 --> 00:39:10,513
You're playing
with me and you know it.

836
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:12,974
What I know is,
you're playing with me, too.

837
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:16,895
You kept flirting with me long after
you started dating her.

838
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:17,979
Yeah, well,
that's going to stop.

839
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:20,607
Good.

840
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:22,859
You know,
and while you're at it,

841
00:39:22,985 --> 00:39:25,111
no more running to me for favors or
asking me for help.

842
00:39:25,237 --> 00:39:26,905
How about you find yourself
some other paralegal?

843
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:29,407
Because as far
as I'm concerned, we're done.

844
00:39:33,245 --> 00:39:35,622
Yeah,
I forget what excuse he used this time.

845
00:39:35,748 --> 00:39:37,332
I've heard them
all before.

846
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:42,212
Uh, can you
give us a minute?

847
00:39:46,634 --> 00:39:47,967
Wow. Jessica.

848
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:51,429
I've spoken to
Alexandra Leeds.

849
00:39:52,973 --> 00:39:54,641
She told me about
the deal you cut.

850
00:39:55,309 --> 00:39:56,893
What do you
want me to say?

851
00:39:58,854 --> 00:39:59,854
Hmm.

852
00:40:00,773 --> 00:40:02,107
This is a copy.

853
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:06,861
I'm driving over to
the Attorney General's office right now.

854
00:40:07,488 --> 00:40:10,949
If she doesn't tell me you've cut a new
deal by the time I get there,

855
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:12,992
she gets the original.

856
00:40:13,911 --> 00:40:15,203
And then,
I give her the proof.

857
00:40:17,998 --> 00:40:20,041
You don't have the proof.

858
00:40:20,459 --> 00:40:21,793
Don't I?

859
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:26,381
Cut a new deal.

860
00:40:27,716 --> 00:40:30,135
And if you ever mess
with one of mine again,

861
00:40:31,178 --> 00:40:33,221
Alexandra gets
that anyway.

862
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:50,947
You don't
have to testify.

863
00:40:53,367 --> 00:40:55,118
They don't
need you anymore.

864
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:57,996
Cameron made a deal?
He made a deal.

865
00:40:58,747 --> 00:41:00,248
To sell you out.

866
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:03,209
But I made
my own deal.

867
00:41:03,335 --> 00:41:07,046
He'll be stepping down. Spending some
quality time with his family.

868
00:41:07,173 --> 00:41:08,715
How exactly did
you manage that?

869
00:41:08,841 --> 00:41:12,177
Not your concern. But you're in
the clear, Harvey.

870
00:41:15,222 --> 00:41:17,640
Some people would be
happy with that news.

871
00:41:18,601 --> 00:41:20,310
That son of a bitch.

872
00:41:21,061 --> 00:41:23,104
Clifford Danner.
He was 18.

873
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:24,564
I put him in jail
12 years ago.

874
00:41:25,065 --> 00:41:28,443
Kid's been rotting in prison
his whole adult life.

875
00:41:29,278 --> 00:41:30,361
And?

876
00:41:31,447 --> 00:41:32,780
He's innocent.

877
00:41:34,533 --> 00:41:36,159
Cameron buried
the evidence.

878
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:38,119
If I'd had it...

879
00:41:38,913 --> 00:41:40,413
Do you have enough
to overturn?

880
00:41:41,248 --> 00:41:42,123
I don't know.

881
00:41:48,047 --> 00:41:50,131
So, what are you going to do?

882
00:41:54,136 --> 00:41:56,346
I'm going to get him out.
