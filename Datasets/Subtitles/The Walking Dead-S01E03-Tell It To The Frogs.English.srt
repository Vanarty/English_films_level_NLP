1
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:04,671
( thunder rumbling )

2
00:00:04,838 --> 00:00:07,466
Merle:
That's right. You heard me, bitch.

3
00:00:07,633 --> 00:00:09,092
You got a problem?

4
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:11,345
Bring it on
if you're man enough,

5
00:00:11,512 --> 00:00:14,556
or take it up the chain
if you're a pussy.

6
00:00:15,724 --> 00:00:19,394
You heard me,
you pussy-ass noncom bitch.

7
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:21,188
You ain't deaf.

8
00:00:21,355 --> 00:00:23,231
Take it up
the damn chain of command

9
00:00:23,397 --> 00:00:27,985
or you can kiss my lily-white ass.

10
00:00:28,152 --> 00:00:30,112
( laughs )
That's right.

11
00:00:30,279 --> 00:00:32,532
That's what I said.
You heard me.

12
00:00:32,698 --> 00:00:35,117
And then this idiot,
he takes a swing,

13
00:00:35,284 --> 00:00:37,244
you know, and well...

14
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:40,497
( laughing hysterically )

15
00:00:40,664 --> 00:00:43,500
Oh, you should've seen
the look on his face

16
00:00:43,667 --> 00:00:46,962
when I punched out his front teeth.

17
00:00:48,588 --> 00:00:50,590
Yeah, five of â€˜em.

18
00:00:50,757 --> 00:00:53,552
Pow! Pow! Just like that.

19
00:00:53,718 --> 00:00:55,554
Huh.

20
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:57,722
Oh my god.

21
00:00:57,889 --> 00:01:01,101
16 months in the stockade--

22
00:01:01,268 --> 00:01:04,437
oh, that's what them teeth cost me.

23
00:01:06,481 --> 00:01:08,149
That was--

24
00:01:08,316 --> 00:01:10,860
that was hard time,

25
00:01:12,195 --> 00:01:15,073
but by God,
it was worth every minute of it

26
00:01:16,365 --> 00:01:18,200
just to see that prick

27
00:01:18,367 --> 00:01:20,411
spit his teeth out on the ground.

28
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:25,039
Yes sir,

29
00:01:25,206 --> 00:01:26,749
worth every minute.

30
00:01:28,333 --> 00:01:30,127
Mmm.

31
00:01:33,213 --> 00:01:35,215
( wind blowing )

32
00:01:49,688 --> 00:01:51,106
Oh no.

33
00:01:51,273 --> 00:01:54,109
No no! No no! No no!

34
00:01:54,276 --> 00:01:55,819
God! God!

35
00:01:55,986 --> 00:01:58,322
No no!
( grunts )

36
00:01:58,488 --> 00:02:00,532
God! Jesus!

37
00:02:00,699 --> 00:02:02,117
No no, merciful Christ!

38
00:02:02,284 --> 00:02:03,784
No no. No no.

39
00:02:03,951 --> 00:02:07,204
God, help me! God! God!

40
00:02:07,371 --> 00:02:10,249
Jesus, please! Jesus, please.

41
00:02:10,416 --> 00:02:12,960
Help me! Come on now!

42
00:02:13,127 --> 00:02:14,670
Help me.

43
00:02:14,837 --> 00:02:16,839
( zombies growling, banging )

44
00:02:23,054 --> 00:02:24,430
( softly )
No no. Oh, no no.

45
00:02:24,597 --> 00:02:25,889
Oh my God.

46
00:02:26,056 --> 00:02:28,350
Shh shh shh shh shh.

47
00:02:28,516 --> 00:02:31,936
( crying )
Oh, Jesus. Jesus.

48
00:02:36,524 --> 00:02:38,484
No no no no no no.

49
00:02:38,651 --> 00:02:40,151
Please.

50
00:02:40,318 --> 00:02:42,527
I didn't behave, I know.

51
00:02:42,694 --> 00:02:44,654
I know I'm being punished.

52
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:46,864
I know. I--

53
00:02:47,031 --> 00:02:49,367
oh, I deserve it. I deserve it.

54
00:02:49,533 --> 00:02:50,951
I've been bad.

55
00:02:54,163 --> 00:02:55,831
Help me now.
Show me the way.

56
00:02:55,998 --> 00:02:58,334
Go on, tell me what to do.

57
00:02:58,501 --> 00:03:00,001
Tell me. Tell me.

58
00:03:02,545 --> 00:03:04,089
God!

59
00:03:11,554 --> 00:03:13,640
( grunting )

60
00:03:15,809 --> 00:03:17,685
That's okay.

61
00:03:18,727 --> 00:03:21,438
Never you mind, silly Christ boy.

62
00:03:21,605 --> 00:03:23,524
I ain't begged you before.

63
00:03:23,691 --> 00:03:26,026
I ain't gonna start begging now.

64
00:03:26,193 --> 00:03:28,612
I ain't gonna beg you now!

65
00:03:28,779 --> 00:03:31,699
Don't you worry about me

66
00:03:31,865 --> 00:03:34,826
begging you ever!
I'll never beg you!

67
00:03:34,992 --> 00:03:37,203
I ain't gonna beg you!

68
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:39,539
I never begged you before.

69
00:03:39,706 --> 00:03:42,417
- ( grunting )
- ( banging, growling continues )

70
00:03:42,583 --> 00:03:45,461
Oh shit.

71
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:50,550
No!

72
00:03:50,717 --> 00:03:53,344
( theme music playing )

73
00:04:28,671 --> 00:04:30,590 X1:0
Best not to dwell on it.

74
00:04:30,757 --> 00:04:32,925 X1:0
Merle got left behind.

75
00:04:35,553 --> 00:04:37,555 X1:0
Nobody's gonna be sad
he didn't come back...

76
00:04:39,599 --> 00:04:41,559 X1:0
except maybe Daryl.

77
00:04:41,726 --> 00:04:44,395 X1:0
- Daryl?
- His brother.

78
00:04:44,562 --> 00:04:47,273 X1:0
( car alarm approaching )

79
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,067 X1:0
( Glenn whooping )

80
00:04:51,986 --> 00:04:53,946 X1:0
Whoo-hoo!

81
00:04:56,199 --> 00:04:58,784 X1:0
At least somebody's
having a good day.

82
00:04:59,868 --> 00:05:01,703 X1:0
- ( rattling )
- ( kids grunting )

83
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:05,081 X1:0
- Girl: Give it back.
- Boy: Stop it.

84
00:05:05,248 --> 00:05:09,211 X1:0
- Girl: No!
- Boy: I found it.

85
00:05:09,377 --> 00:05:11,296 X1:0
- Girl: No!
- Boy: Give it.

86
00:05:11,463 --> 00:05:13,089 X1:0
M'hijo, leave your sister alone.

87
00:05:13,256 --> 00:05:14,591 X1:0
- Why?
- Come on.

88
00:05:14,758 --> 00:05:16,718 X1:0
Baby, the more you fidget,
the longer it takes.

89
00:05:16,885 --> 00:05:19,470 X1:0
- So don't, okay?
- I'm trying.

90
00:05:19,637 --> 00:05:20,721 X1:0
Well, try harder.

91
00:05:20,888 --> 00:05:22,139 X1:0
Shane:
If you think this is bad,

92
00:05:22,306 --> 00:05:24,767 X1:0
wait till you start shaving.

93
00:05:24,934 --> 00:05:26,142
That stings.

94
00:05:26,309 --> 00:05:28,561
That day comes,
you'll be wishing

95
00:05:28,728 --> 00:05:30,020
for one of your mama's haircuts.

96
00:05:30,187 --> 00:05:32,648
- I'll believe that when I see it.
- ( Shane chuckles )

97
00:05:32,815 --> 00:05:34,983
I'll tell you what--
you just get through this

98
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:39,029
with some manly dignity and tomorrow
I'll teach you something special.

99
00:05:40,072 --> 00:05:42,741
I will teach you to catch frogs.

100
00:05:42,908 --> 00:05:45,994
- I've caught a frog before.
- I said frogs-- plural.

101
00:05:46,161 --> 00:05:49,164
And it is an art, my friend.
It is not to be taken lightly.

102
00:05:49,331 --> 00:05:51,916
There are ways and means.

103
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:53,583
Few people know about it.

104
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:56,044
I'm willing to share my secrets.

105
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,505
Oh, I'm a girl.
You talk to him.

106
00:06:00,672 --> 00:06:03,883
( chuckles ) It's a one-time offer,
bud-- not to be repeated.

107
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:07,303
Carl:
Why do we need frogs, plural?

108
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:10,098
- Shane: You ever eat frog legs?
- Eww!

109
00:06:10,265 --> 00:06:13,017
- No, yum!
- No, he's right. Eww.

110
00:06:13,184 --> 00:06:15,645
When you get down
to that last can of beans,

111
00:06:15,812 --> 00:06:17,604
you're gonna be loving
those frog legs, lady.

112
00:06:17,771 --> 00:06:20,983
I can see it now-- "Shane, do you think
I could have a second helping, please?

113
00:06:21,149 --> 00:06:23,902
- Please? Just one?"
- Yeah, I doubt that.

114
00:06:24,069 --> 00:06:26,113
( chuckles )
Don't listen to her, man.

115
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,574
You and me, we'll be heroes.
We'll feed these folks

116
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:30,616
Cajun-style Kermit legs.

117
00:06:30,783 --> 00:06:32,702
I would rather eat Miss Piggy.

118
00:06:32,869 --> 00:06:35,705
- Yes, that came out wrong.
- ( Shane laughs )

119
00:06:35,872 --> 00:06:38,416
Shane: Heroes, son,
spoken of in song and legend.

120
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:40,293
You and me, Shane and Carl.

121
00:06:40,459 --> 00:06:42,295
- ( Carl and Shane laugh )
- ( car alarm approaching )

122
00:06:42,461 --> 00:06:45,089
Man:
Hey, Dale, can you see what that is?

123
00:06:45,256 --> 00:06:46,883
Shane:
Talk to me, Dale!

124
00:06:47,049 --> 00:06:50,052
- I can't tell yet.
- Man: Let him get a good look at it.

125
00:06:54,348 --> 00:06:56,434
Is it them? Are they back?

126
00:07:00,021 --> 00:07:01,521
Dale:
I'll be damned.

127
00:07:01,688 --> 00:07:05,025
- Amy: What is it?
- A stolen car is my guess.

128
00:07:17,245 --> 00:07:20,582
- Holy crap. Turn that damn thing off!
- I don't know how!

129
00:07:20,749 --> 00:07:22,417
- Pop the hood, please. Pop the hood.
- My sister Andrea--

130
00:07:22,584 --> 00:07:24,753
- Pop the damn hood, please!
- What? Okay okay. Yeah yeah yeah

131
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:27,713
- yeah yeah!
- Is she okay? Is she all right?

132
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,049
- Yeah yeah. She's okay! She's okay!
- Is she coming back?

133
00:07:30,215 --> 00:07:32,009
- Glenn: Yes!
- Amy: Why isn't she with you?

134
00:07:32,176 --> 00:07:34,929
- Where is she? She's okay?
- Yes!

135
00:07:35,095 --> 00:07:37,014
Yeah, fine. Everybody is.

136
00:07:38,557 --> 00:07:40,059
Well, Merle not so much.

137
00:07:40,225 --> 00:07:42,144
Are you crazy, driving this
wailing bastard up here?

138
00:07:42,311 --> 00:07:44,021
Are you trying to draw
every walker for miles?

139
00:07:44,188 --> 00:07:47,066
- I think we're okay.
- You call being stupid okay?

140
00:07:47,232 --> 00:07:48,776
Dale: Well, the alarm was
echoing all over these hills.

141
00:07:48,943 --> 00:07:51,111
Hard to pinpoint the source.

142
00:07:51,278 --> 00:07:53,447
I'm not arguing. I'm just saying.

143
00:07:53,614 --> 00:07:55,282
It wouldn't hurt you
to think things through

144
00:07:55,449 --> 00:07:57,409
a little more carefully
next time, would it?

145
00:07:58,452 --> 00:07:59,578
5orry.

146
00:07:59,745 --> 00:08:02,456
Got a cool car.

147
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:06,710
( truck approaches )

148
00:08:15,469 --> 00:08:17,638
- Come meet everybody.
- ( engine stops )

149
00:08:22,393 --> 00:08:24,853
( sliding door opens )

150
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:28,023
- Amy.
- ( crying ) Andrea!

151
00:08:30,734 --> 00:08:34,321
- Andrea: Oh!
- Oh my God!

152
00:08:34,488 --> 00:08:37,491
You scared the shit out of me.

153
00:08:37,658 --> 00:08:40,995
- Boy: Papi! Daddy!
- Morales: Hey.

154
00:08:41,161 --> 00:08:42,955
Lori:
Come here, sweetie.

155
00:08:43,122 --> 00:08:44,498
Morales: Hey.

156
00:08:44,665 --> 00:08:47,418
I told you I'd be back, didn't I?

157
00:08:50,337 --> 00:08:53,090
( silent )

158
00:08:53,257 --> 00:08:56,343
( whispers )

159
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:59,679
- Dale: You are a welcome sight.
- ( both laugh )

160
00:08:59,846 --> 00:09:02,807
I thought we had lost
you folks for sure.

161
00:09:02,974 --> 00:09:04,726
How'd y'all get out
of there anyway?

162
00:09:04,892 --> 00:09:08,021
- New guy-- he got us out.
- Shane: New guy?

163
00:09:08,187 --> 00:09:10,147
Morales: Yeah, crazy vato
just got into town.

164
00:09:10,313 --> 00:09:13,775
- Hey, helicopter boy! Come say hello.
- ( truck door opens, shuts )

165
00:09:16,028 --> 00:09:18,196
Morales:
The guy's a cop like you.

166
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:38,258
Oh my God.

167
00:09:41,219 --> 00:09:43,179
Dad! Dad!

168
00:09:43,345 --> 00:09:44,929
( crying )

169
00:09:46,013 --> 00:09:47,597
Carl.

170
00:09:49,682 --> 00:09:51,392
Oh!

171
00:10:26,594 --> 00:10:26,636
- ( crickets chirping )
- Rick: Disoriented.

172
00:10:26,636 --> 00:10:29,722
- ( crickets chirping )
- Rick: Disoriented.

173
00:10:29,889 --> 00:10:31,974
I guess that comes closest.

174
00:10:33,017 --> 00:10:34,435
Disoriented.

175
00:10:36,187 --> 00:10:39,065
Fear, confusion--
all those things but...

176
00:10:39,232 --> 00:10:40,732
( thunder rumbling )

177
00:10:40,899 --> 00:10:43,276
disoriented comes closest.

178
00:10:43,443 --> 00:10:45,570
Words can be
meager things.

179
00:10:45,737 --> 00:10:48,448
Sometimes they fall short.

180
00:10:48,615 --> 00:10:50,951
Rick: I felt like I'd been
ripped out of my life

181
00:10:51,118 --> 00:10:53,120
and put somewhere else.

182
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:57,081
For a while
I thought I was trapped

183
00:10:57,248 --> 00:10:59,457
in some coma dream,

184
00:10:59,624 --> 00:11:02,417
something I might not
wake up from ever.

185
00:11:04,753 --> 00:11:06,463
Mom said you died.

186
00:11:10,467 --> 00:11:13,428
She had every reason
to believe that.

187
00:11:13,595 --> 00:11:15,639
Don't you ever doubt it.

188
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:20,227
Lori: When things started
to get really bad,

189
00:11:20,394 --> 00:11:22,603
they told me at the hospital that

190
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:25,939
they were gonna medevac you
and the other patients to Atlanta,

191
00:11:27,107 --> 00:11:29,234
and it never happened.

192
00:11:29,401 --> 00:11:31,862
Well, I'm not surprised
after Atlanta fell.

193
00:11:32,028 --> 00:11:34,698
- Lori: Yeah.
- And from the look of that hospital,

194
00:11:34,865 --> 00:11:36,408
it got overrun.

195
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:40,370
Yeah, looks don't deceive.
I barely got them out,

196
00:11:40,537 --> 00:11:42,329
you know?

197
00:11:42,496 --> 00:11:45,541
I can't tell you how grateful
I am to you, Shane.

198
00:11:46,667 --> 00:11:48,419
I can't begin to express it.

199
00:11:50,546 --> 00:11:53,174
There go those words
falling short again.

200
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:55,384
Paltry things.

201
00:11:58,304 --> 00:12:00,014
( wood clatters )

202
00:12:04,852 --> 00:12:08,147
Hey, Ed, you want
to rethink that log?

203
00:12:08,314 --> 00:12:10,190
It's cold, man.

204
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:16,029
The cold don't change
the rules, does it?

205
00:12:16,196 --> 00:12:20,033
Keep our fires low,
just embers, so we can't be seen

206
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,535
- from a distance, right?
- I said it's cold.

207
00:12:22,702 --> 00:12:24,704
You should mind your own
business for once.

208
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:34,547
Hey, Ed... ( pats )

209
00:12:36,215 --> 00:12:38,675
( softly ) are you sure you want
to have this conversation, man?

210
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:44,680
Go on.
Pull the damn thing out.

211
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:46,390
Go on!

212
00:12:49,393 --> 00:12:51,229
( mutters )
Christ.

213
00:12:53,356 --> 00:12:55,358
( wood thunks, sizzling )

214
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:09,080
Hey, Carol, Sophia,
how are y'all this evening?

215
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:12,083
- Fine. We're just fine.
- Shane: Okay.

216
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:14,793
- I'm sorry about the fire.
- Shane: No no no no.

217
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,544
No apology needed.

218
00:13:18,046 --> 00:13:19,756
Y'all have a good night, okay?

219
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:22,425
Thank you.

220
00:13:22,592 --> 00:13:24,761
I appreciate the cooperation.

221
00:13:32,769 --> 00:13:34,353
( Shane sighs )

222
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:37,022
Dale: Have you given
any thought to Daryl Dixon?

223
00:13:37,189 --> 00:13:39,900
He won't be happy to hear
his brother was left behind.

224
00:13:40,067 --> 00:13:43,112
I'll tell him.
I dropped the key. It's on me.

225
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:45,030
I cuffed him.
That makes it mine.

226
00:13:45,197 --> 00:13:46,699
Glenn:
Guys, it's not a competition.

227
00:13:46,865 --> 00:13:48,533
I don't mean to bring race into this,

228
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,909
but it might sound better
coming from a white guy.

229
00:13:53,494 --> 00:13:55,121
I did what I did.

230
00:13:55,288 --> 00:13:57,456
Hell if I'm gonna hide from him.

231
00:13:57,623 --> 00:14:00,584
- We could lie.
- Or tell the truth.

232
00:14:00,751 --> 00:14:03,004
Merle was out of control.

233
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:06,090
Something had to be done
or he'd have gotten us killed.

234
00:14:07,216 --> 00:14:09,051
Your husband did
what was necessary.

235
00:14:09,218 --> 00:14:10,636
And if Merle got left behind,

236
00:14:10,803 --> 00:14:12,805
it is nobody's fault but Merle's.

237
00:14:12,972 --> 00:14:15,224
And that's what we tell Daryl?

238
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,477
I don't see a rational discussion

239
00:14:19,644 --> 00:14:21,730
to be had from that, do you?

240
00:14:24,523 --> 00:14:26,066
Word to the wise--

241
00:14:27,234 --> 00:14:28,818
we're gonna have our hands full

242
00:14:28,985 --> 00:14:30,653
when he gets back from his hunt.

243
00:14:32,488 --> 00:14:35,783
T-Dog:
I was scared and I ran.

244
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:38,161
- I'm not ashamed of it.
- Andrea: We were all scared.

245
00:14:38,328 --> 00:14:40,788
We all ran. What's your point?

246
00:14:40,955 --> 00:14:43,041
I stopped long enough
to chain that door.

247
00:14:45,168 --> 00:14:46,627
Staircase is narrow.

248
00:14:46,794 --> 00:14:49,255
Maybe half a dozen geeks
can squeeze against it

249
00:14:49,422 --> 00:14:51,174
at any one time.

250
00:14:51,341 --> 00:14:53,593
It's not enough
to break through that--

251
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,845
not that chain, not that padlock.

252
00:14:58,014 --> 00:15:01,642
My point-- Dixon's alive

253
00:15:01,809 --> 00:15:04,729
and he's still up there,
handcuffed on that roof.

254
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:07,690
That's on us.

255
00:15:20,703 --> 00:15:24,290
I found you, didn't I?

256
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:28,043
I love you, Dad.

257
00:15:30,712 --> 00:15:32,714
I love you, Carl.

258
00:16:12,003 --> 00:16:14,089
I found you both.

259
00:16:15,257 --> 00:16:16,883
- Lori: Yeah.
- ( thunder rumbling )

260
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:22,138
I knew I would.

261
00:16:23,764 --> 00:16:26,434
You're getting cocky now,
a little bit.

262
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,894
No. No, I knew.

263
00:16:30,604 --> 00:16:33,607
Walking into our home,
finding an empty house,

264
00:16:33,774 --> 00:16:35,609
- both of you gone.
- I'm so sorry.

265
00:16:35,776 --> 00:16:38,863
I knew you were alive.

266
00:16:40,781 --> 00:16:42,783
How?

267
00:16:44,451 --> 00:16:46,828
The photos were gone,

268
00:16:46,995 --> 00:16:49,122
all our family albums.

269
00:16:58,798 --> 00:17:00,508
( chuckles )

270
00:17:12,479 --> 00:17:14,314
I told you so.

271
00:17:14,481 --> 00:17:16,983
Now you're getting cocky, huh?

272
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:18,650
A lot.

273
00:17:32,331 --> 00:17:34,333
It belongs in here.

274
00:17:40,506 --> 00:17:43,550
Baby, I really thought
I would never see you again.

275
00:17:47,971 --> 00:17:49,890
I'm so sorry...

276
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:53,018
for everything.

277
00:17:55,854 --> 00:17:57,814
I feel like--

278
00:17:57,981 --> 00:18:00,108
when you were
in the hospital, I just--

279
00:18:00,275 --> 00:18:02,027
I wanted to take it all back--

280
00:18:02,194 --> 00:18:04,613
the anger and the bad times.

281
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:07,282
But the mistakes--

282
00:18:10,702 --> 00:18:12,871
Maybe we got a second chance.

283
00:18:13,038 --> 00:18:15,207
Not many people get that.

284
00:18:32,266 --> 00:18:34,268
I wondered where that went.

285
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:38,521
Do you want it back?

286
00:18:40,565 --> 00:18:42,441
Of course.

287
00:19:18,686 --> 00:19:20,688
( rain pattering )

288
00:19:28,237 --> 00:19:30,239
He won't wake up.

289
00:19:44,337 --> 00:19:46,339
( thunder rumbling )

290
00:20:13,658 --> 00:20:15,826
( bugs chittering )

291
00:20:15,993 --> 00:20:17,995
( kids playing )

292
00:20:31,258 --> 00:20:33,552
( people chatting )

293
00:20:33,719 --> 00:20:35,262
- Morning.
- Man: Morning.

294
00:20:37,138 --> 00:20:38,473
- Hey.
- Hi.

295
00:20:41,309 --> 00:20:42,811
- Carol: Morning.
- Morning.

296
00:20:42,977 --> 00:20:44,229
They're still a little damp.

297
00:20:44,396 --> 00:20:45,688
The sun'll have â€˜em
dry in no time.

298
00:20:45,854 --> 00:20:48,815
- You washed my clothes?
- Well, best we could.

299
00:20:48,981 --> 00:20:50,191
Scrubbing on a washboard

300
00:20:50,358 --> 00:20:52,443
ain't half as good
as my old Maytag back home.

301
00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:54,529
That's very kind.
Thank you.

302
00:20:57,156 --> 00:21:00,368
- ( tools clanging )
- Look at â€˜em.

303
00:21:00,535 --> 00:21:02,620
Vultures.

304
00:21:02,787 --> 00:21:04,663
Yeah, go on, strip it clean.

305
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:06,581
Generators need every drop
of fuel they can get.

306
00:21:06,748 --> 00:21:09,960
Got no power without it.
Sorry, Glenn.

307
00:21:10,127 --> 00:21:12,879
Thought I'd get to drive it
at least a few more days.

308
00:21:13,046 --> 00:21:16,299
Maybe we'll get to steal
another one someday.

309
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:23,222
Lori:
Morning, officer.

310
00:21:23,389 --> 00:21:25,224
Rick: Hey.

311
00:21:29,145 --> 00:21:30,937
You sleep okay?

312
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:34,399
Better than in a long time.

313
00:21:34,566 --> 00:21:36,066
( chuckles )

314
00:21:36,233 --> 00:21:39,778
Well, I didn't want to wake you.
I figured you could use it.

315
00:21:42,739 --> 00:21:45,408
- God. What?
- I've been thinking

316
00:21:45,575 --> 00:21:47,869
about the man we left behind.

317
00:21:51,038 --> 00:21:52,790
You're not serious.

318
00:21:54,792 --> 00:21:56,419
( car approaches )

319
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:02,924
Water's here, y'all.

320
00:22:03,091 --> 00:22:05,676
Just a reminder to boil before use.

321
00:22:12,223 --> 00:22:14,768
Are you asking me or telling me?

322
00:22:15,935 --> 00:22:17,771
- Asking.
- Well, I think it's crazy.

323
00:22:17,937 --> 00:22:20,106
I think it is just
the stupidest way

324
00:22:20,273 --> 00:22:21,608
- to break your son--
- ( woman screams )

325
00:22:21,775 --> 00:22:23,067
- Carl: Mom!
- Carl?

326
00:22:23,234 --> 00:22:24,402
Man:
It's over there!

327
00:22:24,569 --> 00:22:25,779
- Carl: Dad!
- Lori: Baby!

328
00:22:25,945 --> 00:22:28,239
- Girl: Mama! Mommy!
- Glenn: Rick!

329
00:22:28,406 --> 00:22:30,282
- Lori: Carl!
- Man: Over here! Come on, come on!

330
00:22:30,449 --> 00:22:32,826
Lori:
Carl! Baby!

331
00:22:32,993 --> 00:22:34,953
- Carl: Mom!
- Lori: You're okay! I've got him.

332
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,080
Nothing bit you?
Nothing scratched you?

333
00:22:37,247 --> 00:22:38,415
- No, I'm okay.
- ( cans rattle )

334
00:22:48,258 --> 00:22:50,260
( growling )

335
00:23:01,188 --> 00:23:02,980
( gasps )

336
00:23:14,742 --> 00:23:16,618
( men grunting )

337
00:23:35,804 --> 00:23:37,848
It's the first one
we've had up here.

338
00:23:38,014 --> 00:23:40,183
They never come this far
up the mountain.

339
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:42,935
Well, they're running out
of food in the city, that's what.

340
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:49,358
- ( branch snaps )
- ( footsteps )

341
00:24:05,291 --> 00:24:09,169
- Oh, Jesus.
- Man: Son of a bitch.

342
00:24:10,671 --> 00:24:12,673
That's my deer!

343
00:24:14,758 --> 00:24:16,677
Look at it.
All gnawed on by this...

344
00:24:16,844 --> 00:24:18,720
( kicking )
filthy, disease-bearing,

345
00:24:18,887 --> 00:24:21,639
motherless poxy bastard!

346
00:24:21,806 --> 00:24:23,224
Calm down, son.
That's not helping.

347
00:24:23,391 --> 00:24:24,893
What do you know
about it, old man?

348
00:24:25,059 --> 00:24:27,729
Why don't you take that stupid hat
and go back to "On Golden Pond"?

349
00:24:27,896 --> 00:24:31,566
I've been tracking
this deer for miles.

350
00:24:31,733 --> 00:24:33,568
Gonna drag it back to camp,

351
00:24:33,735 --> 00:24:35,695
cook us up some venison.

352
00:24:35,862 --> 00:24:37,697
What do you think?
Do you think we can cut around

353
00:24:37,864 --> 00:24:39,240
this chewed up part
right here?

354
00:24:39,407 --> 00:24:40,867
I would not risk that.

355
00:24:41,034 --> 00:24:43,536
( sighs )
That's a damn shame.

356
00:24:43,703 --> 00:24:46,205
I got some squirrel--
about a dozen or so.

357
00:24:46,372 --> 00:24:49,083
That'll have to do.

358
00:24:53,546 --> 00:24:55,089
Oh God.

359
00:24:56,841 --> 00:24:58,843
Come on, people.
What the hell?

360
00:25:06,476 --> 00:25:08,268
It's gotta be the brain.

361
00:25:08,435 --> 00:25:10,520
Don't y'all know nothing?

362
00:25:19,112 --> 00:25:20,447
Merle!

363
00:25:22,282 --> 00:25:25,702
Merle! Get your ugly ass out here!

364
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:28,288
I got us some squirrel!

365
00:25:28,455 --> 00:25:30,247
Let's stew â€˜em up.

366
00:25:31,623 --> 00:25:35,335
Shane: Daryl, just slow up a bit.
I need to talk to you.

367
00:25:37,963 --> 00:25:39,631
Daryl:
About what?

368
00:25:39,798 --> 00:25:41,967
Shane:
About Merle.

369
00:25:42,133 --> 00:25:43,593
There was a--

370
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,762
there was a problem in Atlanta.

371
00:25:53,687 --> 00:25:55,605
He dead?

372
00:25:56,981 --> 00:25:59,024
Shane:
We're not sure.

373
00:25:59,191 --> 00:26:01,151
He either is or he ain't!

374
00:26:01,318 --> 00:26:03,821
No easy way to say this,
so I'll just say it.

375
00:26:04,905 --> 00:26:07,157
- Who are you?
- Rick Grimes.

376
00:26:07,324 --> 00:26:10,744
Rick Grimes, you got something
you want to tell me?

377
00:26:10,911 --> 00:26:12,830
Your brother was
a danger to us all,

378
00:26:12,997 --> 00:26:15,958
so I handcuffed him on a roof,
hooked him to a piece of metal.

379
00:26:16,125 --> 00:26:18,252
He's still there.

380
00:26:18,419 --> 00:26:22,006
Hold on.
Let me process this.

381
00:26:22,172 --> 00:26:25,050
You're saying you handcuffed
my brother to a roof

382
00:26:25,217 --> 00:26:26,760
and you left him there?!

383
00:26:26,927 --> 00:26:28,846
Yeah.

384
00:26:31,473 --> 00:26:34,810
- ( grunts )
- Hey.

385
00:26:36,102 --> 00:26:37,520
Watch the knife!

386
00:26:37,687 --> 00:26:39,479
( shouts, grunting )

387
00:26:42,024 --> 00:26:43,816
Shane:
Okay. Okay.

388
00:26:43,983 --> 00:26:47,152
- You'd best let me go!
- Nah, I think it's better if I don't.

389
00:26:47,318 --> 00:26:49,278
( Daryl grunting )
Choke hold's illegal.

390
00:26:49,445 --> 00:26:51,113
Shane:
You can file a complaint.

391
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:53,115
Come on, man.
We'll keep this up all day.

392
00:26:54,575 --> 00:26:57,202
I'd like to have
a calm discussion on this topic.

393
00:26:57,369 --> 00:26:59,245
Do you think
we can manage that?

394
00:26:59,412 --> 00:27:02,581
- Do you think we can manage that?
- Shane: Hmm?

395
00:27:03,749 --> 00:27:05,541
Mmm. Yeah.

396
00:27:05,708 --> 00:27:08,002
( Daryl panting )

397
00:27:08,169 --> 00:27:10,546
What I did was not on a whim.

398
00:27:10,713 --> 00:27:14,674
Your brother does not work
and play well with others.

399
00:27:14,841 --> 00:27:18,636
It's not Rick's fault. I had the key.

400
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:21,347
- I dropped it.
- You couldn't pick it up?

401
00:27:21,514 --> 00:27:23,933
Well, I dropped it
in a drain.

402
00:27:31,775 --> 00:27:33,943
If it's supposed to make me
feel better, it don't.

403
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:35,528
T-Dog:
Well, maybe this will.

404
00:27:35,695 --> 00:27:37,489
Look, I chained
the door to the roof--

405
00:27:37,655 --> 00:27:39,239
so the geeks couldn't
get at him--

406
00:27:39,406 --> 00:27:43,159
- with a padlock.
- It's gotta count for something.

407
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:50,541
Hell with all y'all!

408
00:27:50,708 --> 00:27:52,877
Just tell me where he is

409
00:27:53,044 --> 00:27:54,920
so's I can go get him.

410
00:27:55,087 --> 00:27:57,547
Lori:
He'll show you.

411
00:27:57,714 --> 00:27:59,549
Isn't that right?

412
00:28:05,888 --> 00:28:07,890
I'm going back.

413
00:28:14,437 --> 00:28:16,940
( sighs )

414
00:28:24,948 --> 00:28:26,740
So that's it, huh?

415
00:28:26,907 --> 00:28:28,742
You're just gonna walk off?

416
00:28:28,909 --> 00:28:30,619
Just to hell with everybody else?

417
00:28:30,786 --> 00:28:32,538
I'm not saying
to hell with anybody--

418
00:28:32,704 --> 00:28:34,873
not you, Shane;
Lori least of all.

419
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:37,209
Shane:
Tell her that.

420
00:28:39,253 --> 00:28:40,587
She knows.

421
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:43,132
Shane:
Well, look, I--

422
00:28:43,298 --> 00:28:45,300
I don't, okay, Rick?
So could you just--

423
00:28:45,467 --> 00:28:47,386
could you throw me
a bone here, man?

424
00:28:47,553 --> 00:28:49,096
Could you just tell me why?

425
00:28:49,263 --> 00:28:51,431
Why would you risk your life
for a douche bag like Merle Dixon?

426
00:28:51,598 --> 00:28:53,308
Daryl: Hey, choose your words
more carefully.

427
00:28:53,475 --> 00:28:55,394
No, I did.
Douche bag's what I meant.

428
00:28:55,561 --> 00:28:57,396
Merle Dixon--

429
00:28:57,563 --> 00:29:00,107
the guy wouldn't give you a glass
of water if you were dying of thirst.

430
00:29:00,274 --> 00:29:01,984
Rick: What he would
or wouldn't do doesn't interest me.

431
00:29:02,151 --> 00:29:04,570
I can't let a man
die of thirst-- me.

432
00:29:04,736 --> 00:29:06,864
Thirst and exposure.

433
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:09,491
We left him like
an animal caught in a trap.

434
00:29:09,658 --> 00:29:11,952
That's no way for anything to die,
let alone a human being.

435
00:29:14,163 --> 00:29:16,999
So you and Daryl,
that's your big plan?

436
00:29:20,836 --> 00:29:22,504
Oh, come on.

437
00:29:22,671 --> 00:29:24,798
You know the way.
You've been there before--

438
00:29:24,965 --> 00:29:27,259
in and out, no problem.
You said so yourself.

439
00:29:28,759 --> 00:29:30,469
It's not fair of me to ask--
I know that--

440
00:29:30,636 --> 00:29:32,054
but I'd feel a lot better
with you along.

441
00:29:32,221 --> 00:29:34,015
I know she would too.

442
00:29:34,182 --> 00:29:37,351
That's just great. Now you're
gonna risk three men, huh?

443
00:29:37,518 --> 00:29:39,854
- T-Dog: Four.
- ( huffs )

444
00:29:40,021 --> 00:29:42,023
My day just gets better
and better, don't it?

445
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:44,108
T-Dog: You see anybody else
here stepping up

446
00:29:44,275 --> 00:29:47,320
- to save your brother's cracker ass?
- Why you?

447
00:29:47,486 --> 00:29:48,862
T-Dog: You wouldn't even
begin to understand.

448
00:29:49,029 --> 00:29:51,740
- You don't speak my language.
- Dale: That's four.

449
00:29:51,907 --> 00:29:55,202
It's not just four. You're putting
every single one of us at risk.

450
00:29:55,368 --> 00:29:57,829
Just know that, Rick.
Come on, you saw that walker.

451
00:29:57,996 --> 00:29:59,496
It was here.
It was in camp.

452
00:29:59,663 --> 00:30:00,998
They're moving out of the cities.

453
00:30:01,165 --> 00:30:02,917
They come back, we need
every able body we've got.

454
00:30:03,083 --> 00:30:04,710
We need â€˜em here.
We need â€˜em to protect camp.

455
00:30:04,877 --> 00:30:06,879
It seems to me what
you really need most here

456
00:30:08,005 --> 00:30:12,134
- are more guns.
- Right, the guns.

457
00:30:12,301 --> 00:30:14,053
- Wait. What guns?
- Six shotguns,

458
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:17,097
two high-powered rifles,
over a dozen handguns.

459
00:30:17,264 --> 00:30:19,683
I cleaned out the cage
back at the station before I left.

460
00:30:19,850 --> 00:30:22,394
I dropped the bag
in Atlanta when I got swarmed.

461
00:30:22,561 --> 00:30:25,189
It's just sitting there on the street,
waiting to be picked up.

462
00:30:25,356 --> 00:30:29,777
- Ammo?
- 700 rounds, assorted.

463
00:30:29,944 --> 00:30:32,737
Lori: You went through
hell to find us.

464
00:30:32,904 --> 00:30:35,907
You just got here and you're gonna
turn around and leave?

465
00:30:37,075 --> 00:30:39,284
Dad, I don't want you to go.

466
00:30:41,703 --> 00:30:44,248
To hell with the guns.
Shane is right.

467
00:30:44,414 --> 00:30:46,416
Merle Dixon?

468
00:30:46,583 --> 00:30:49,920
He's not worth one of your lives,
even with guns thrown in.

469
00:30:51,588 --> 00:30:53,464
Tell me.
Make me understand.

470
00:30:53,631 --> 00:30:58,094
I owe a debt to a man
I met and his little boy.

471
00:30:58,261 --> 00:31:00,596
Lori, if they hadn't
taken me in,

472
00:31:00,763 --> 00:31:02,598
I'd have died.

473
00:31:02,765 --> 00:31:05,393
It's because of them
that I made it back to you at all.

474
00:31:05,559 --> 00:31:07,812
They said they'd
follow me to Atlanta.

475
00:31:07,979 --> 00:31:10,439
They'll walk into the same trap
I did if I don't warn him.

476
00:31:11,607 --> 00:31:13,943
What's stopping you?

477
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:16,821
The walkie-talkie,
the one in the bag I dropped.

478
00:31:16,988 --> 00:31:20,324
He's got the other one. Our plan was
to connect when they got closer.

479
00:31:20,491 --> 00:31:23,327
- These are our walkies?
- Yeah.

480
00:31:23,494 --> 00:31:25,329
So use the CB.
What's wrong with that?

481
00:31:25,496 --> 00:31:27,290
The CB's fine.

482
00:31:27,456 --> 00:31:29,208
It's the walkies
that suck to crap--

483
00:31:29,375 --> 00:31:31,960
date back to the '70s,
don't match any other bandwidth--

484
00:31:32,127 --> 00:31:33,837
not even the scanners
in our cars.

485
00:31:36,464 --> 00:31:38,466
I need that bag.

486
00:31:51,062 --> 00:31:52,689
Okay?

487
00:31:57,485 --> 00:31:59,445
All right.

488
00:32:02,114 --> 00:32:05,576
- ( truck beeping )
- Rumor is you have bolt cutters.

489
00:32:07,411 --> 00:32:10,956
- Maybe.
- T-Dog: Yeah, we get to that roof,

490
00:32:11,123 --> 00:32:13,876
we'll need to cut that chain
and the handcuffs.

491
00:32:15,376 --> 00:32:17,211
I never like lending tools.

492
00:32:17,378 --> 00:32:18,962
The last time I did--

493
00:32:19,129 --> 00:32:21,173
and yes, I am talking
about you--

494
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:23,508
let's just say your bag of guns

495
00:32:23,675 --> 00:32:25,343
wasn't the only bag
that was dropped.

496
00:32:25,509 --> 00:32:27,970
My tools got
left behind with Merle.

497
00:32:28,137 --> 00:32:30,013
Rick:
We'll bring your tools back too.

498
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:33,475
Think of the bolt cutters
as an investment.

499
00:32:35,059 --> 00:32:37,144
Sounds like more of a gamble.

500
00:32:44,234 --> 00:32:46,779
- What do I get in return?
- Rick: What do you want?

501
00:32:46,945 --> 00:32:48,572
How about one of those guns
you bring back?

502
00:32:48,739 --> 00:32:50,991
- My pick.
- Done.

503
00:32:51,158 --> 00:32:53,994
( man clears throat )
Dale, let's...

504
00:32:54,161 --> 00:32:56,205
sweeten the deal a bit.

505
00:32:57,373 --> 00:32:58,873
Now that cube van of yours--

506
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:01,042
What about it?

507
00:33:01,209 --> 00:33:03,336
The RV's radiator hose is shot.

508
00:33:03,503 --> 00:33:06,923
That's a problem if we need to get
somewhere and wanna get very far.

509
00:33:07,090 --> 00:33:10,675
And the hose on that van is
just about a perfect match--

510
00:33:10,842 --> 00:33:12,677
well, enough that I can make it fit.

511
00:33:12,844 --> 00:33:14,720
I'll tell you what-- we get back,

512
00:33:14,887 --> 00:33:18,349
you can strip that van down
to the bare metal.

513
00:33:18,516 --> 00:33:20,893
( truck honks )

514
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:23,771
- Come on, let's go!
- Thank you.

515
00:33:28,734 --> 00:33:32,487
Hey, Rick,
got any rounds in the Python?

516
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:35,073
No.

517
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,699
Last time we were
on the gun range,

518
00:33:36,866 --> 00:33:40,120
I'm sure I wound up
with a few loose rounds of yours.

519
00:33:41,704 --> 00:33:44,749
You and that bag--
like the bottom of an old lady's purse.

520
00:33:44,916 --> 00:33:46,376
I hate that you're doing this, man.

521
00:33:46,543 --> 00:33:48,920
I think that
it's foolish and reckless.

522
00:33:49,087 --> 00:33:51,464
But if you're gonna go,
you're taking bullets.

523
00:33:51,631 --> 00:33:54,926
I'm not sure I'd want
to fire a shot in the city,

524
00:33:55,093 --> 00:33:57,637
- not after what happened last time.
- That's up to you.

525
00:33:58,972 --> 00:34:00,640
Well...

526
00:34:03,309 --> 00:34:05,437
four men, four rounds.

527
00:34:05,603 --> 00:34:08,398
What are the odds, huh?

528
00:34:09,566 --> 00:34:11,150
Well, let's just hope that--

529
00:34:11,316 --> 00:34:13,986
let's just hope that four is
your lucky number, okay?

530
00:34:15,237 --> 00:34:17,906
- Thank you.
- All right.

531
00:34:32,588 --> 00:34:35,965
( truck starts, revving )

532
00:34:48,478 --> 00:34:51,230
Hey.
( sniffling )

533
00:34:51,397 --> 00:34:53,232
You know,
I bet they'll be just fine.

534
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,444
I'm not worried.

535
00:34:59,237 --> 00:35:00,864
Are you?

536
00:35:03,449 --> 00:35:05,451
Yeah, a little.

537
00:35:06,619 --> 00:35:08,037
Don't be.

538
00:35:09,497 --> 00:35:11,665
- Why?
- Think about it, Mom.

539
00:35:11,832 --> 00:35:14,460
Everything that's
happened to him so far--

540
00:35:15,503 --> 00:35:17,254
nothing's killed him yet.

541
00:35:17,421 --> 00:35:19,089
( chuckles )

542
00:35:34,688 --> 00:35:36,356
Daryl:
He'd better be okay.

543
00:35:36,523 --> 00:35:38,525
It's my only word on the matter.

544
00:35:38,691 --> 00:35:40,443
I told you the geeks
can't get at him.

545
00:35:40,610 --> 00:35:44,363
The only thing that's gonna
get through that door is us.

546
00:35:44,530 --> 00:35:46,240
- ( brakes squeak )
- ( gear shift clicks )

547
00:35:46,406 --> 00:35:49,243
- ( engine stops )
- We walk from here.

548
00:36:09,096 --> 00:36:10,722
Lori: Dale.

549
00:36:10,889 --> 00:36:14,351
- Have you seen Carl?
- Shane took him down to the quarry.

550
00:36:14,518 --> 00:36:17,729
There was some mighty bold talk
about catching frogs.

551
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:24,902
( women chatting )

552
00:36:27,863 --> 00:36:29,699
Carl:
I'm not getting anything.

553
00:36:29,865 --> 00:36:31,659
Yeah.

554
00:36:31,826 --> 00:36:33,911
Being all wily,
staying submerged.

555
00:36:34,078 --> 00:36:35,870
Little suckers,
they know something's up.

556
00:36:36,037 --> 00:36:37,372
That's what's going on.

557
00:36:37,539 --> 00:36:40,417
Just going to have to do this
the old-fashioned way.

558
00:36:41,585 --> 00:36:43,085
All right, little man, look.

559
00:36:43,252 --> 00:36:45,629
You are the-- you are
the key in all this, okay?

560
00:36:45,796 --> 00:36:47,756
All I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna go after one of them,

561
00:36:47,923 --> 00:36:50,092
all right, scare the rest of them off.
They're all gonna scatter.

562
00:36:50,259 --> 00:36:52,135
- I'm gonna drive â€˜em your way, okay?
- All right.

563
00:36:52,302 --> 00:36:53,428
What you need to do
is you need to round up

564
00:36:53,595 --> 00:36:55,597
every bad boy you see,
all right? Are you with me?

565
00:36:55,763 --> 00:36:57,431
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Hells yeah. Give me your mean face.

566
00:36:57,598 --> 00:36:59,308
- ( both growl )
- Yes sir. Are you ready?

567
00:36:59,474 --> 00:37:00,809
- Yeah!
- Are you ready? Here we go, boy.

568
00:37:00,976 --> 00:37:02,768
Here we go.

569
00:37:12,486 --> 00:37:14,280
- ( laughing )
- All right, they're coming your way.

570
00:37:14,447 --> 00:37:15,906
They're coming your way.
Go on, get â€˜em, get â€˜em.

571
00:37:16,073 --> 00:37:17,283
They're coming
your way, come on.

572
00:37:17,450 --> 00:37:20,119
Catch them frogs.
Catch them frogs.

573
00:37:20,286 --> 00:37:23,079
They're coming, little man! Get â€˜em!
Get that net in there and get â€˜em!

574
00:37:23,246 --> 00:37:26,999
I'm beginning to question
the division of labor here.

575
00:37:27,166 --> 00:37:29,585
They're coming, little man! Get â€˜em!
Get that net in there and get â€˜em!

576
00:37:29,752 --> 00:37:32,630
What have you got, bad boy?
What do you got? What do you got?

577
00:37:32,796 --> 00:37:35,591
- Dirt.
- Oh boy.

578
00:37:35,758 --> 00:37:37,009
All right, we've got to start over.

579
00:37:37,176 --> 00:37:40,763
- Come on, let's find this bucket.
- ( both laughing )

580
00:37:40,929 --> 00:37:42,805
Can someone explain to me
how the women wound up

581
00:37:42,972 --> 00:37:44,140
doing all the Hattie McDaniel work?

582
00:37:44,307 --> 00:37:46,768
The world ended.
Didn't you get the memo?

583
00:37:50,145 --> 00:37:51,521
It's just the way it is.

584
00:37:58,654 --> 00:38:00,697
( fence clatters )

585
00:38:02,741 --> 00:38:05,160
- Merle first or guns?
- Merle! We ain't even having

586
00:38:05,327 --> 00:38:07,371
- this conversation.
- ( emphatically ) We are.

587
00:38:07,537 --> 00:38:08,997
You know the geography.
It's your call.

588
00:38:09,164 --> 00:38:12,125
Merle's closest.
The guns would mean doubling back.

589
00:38:12,292 --> 00:38:13,919
Merle first.

590
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,755
( scrubbing )

591
00:38:17,923 --> 00:38:20,467
Carol:
I do miss my Maytag.

592
00:38:22,427 --> 00:38:25,931
I miss my Benz, my sat nav.

593
00:38:26,098 --> 00:38:27,641
I miss my coffeemaker

594
00:38:27,808 --> 00:38:29,559
with that dual-drip filter

595
00:38:29,726 --> 00:38:31,937
and built-in grinder, honey.

596
00:38:32,104 --> 00:38:33,604
My computer...

597
00:38:33,771 --> 00:38:35,439
and texting.

598
00:38:36,607 --> 00:38:37,817
I miss my vibrator.

599
00:38:37,983 --> 00:38:40,319
Jacqui: Oh!

600
00:38:40,486 --> 00:38:43,155
- ( women laugh )
- Amy: Oh my God!

601
00:38:46,075 --> 00:38:48,494
- Me too.
- ( women laughing louder )

602
00:38:53,833 --> 00:38:55,876
What's so funny?

603
00:38:56,043 --> 00:38:58,129
Just swapping war stories, Ed.

604
00:38:59,213 --> 00:39:00,756
Yeah.

605
00:39:03,008 --> 00:39:05,010
( water dripping )

606
00:39:12,393 --> 00:39:14,185
Andrea:
Problem, Ed?

607
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:16,938
Nothin' that concerns you.

608
00:39:18,106 --> 00:39:20,734
And you ought to focus
on your work.

609
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:23,445
- This ain't no comedy club.
- ( Andrea huffs )

610
00:39:26,406 --> 00:39:28,198
Hey, Carl,

611
00:39:28,365 --> 00:39:30,534
what did I tell you about
not leaving Dale's sight?

612
00:39:30,701 --> 00:39:33,120
But Shane said we could
catch frogs, remember?

613
00:39:33,287 --> 00:39:35,163
It doesn't matter what Shane says.
It matters what I say.

614
00:39:35,329 --> 00:39:37,832
- Go on back to camp.
- ( sighs )

615
00:39:37,999 --> 00:39:40,001
Lori:
I'll be right behind you.

616
00:39:43,713 --> 00:39:45,423
I've got to tell you,

617
00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:47,466
I do not think you should be
taking this out on him.

618
00:39:47,632 --> 00:39:49,760
Lori: You don't tell me what to do.
You lost that privilege.

619
00:39:49,926 --> 00:39:52,763
Lori, could you just wait up a sec?
I think we should talk.

620
00:39:52,929 --> 00:39:54,097
- We haven't had a chance--
- No. No no.

621
00:39:54,264 --> 00:39:56,099
That's over too.
You can tell that to the frogs.

622
00:39:56,266 --> 00:39:58,018
Damn it, Lori. Look, I don't know
how it appears to you

623
00:39:58,185 --> 00:39:59,977
- or what you think--
- How it appears to me? I'm sorry.

624
00:40:00,144 --> 00:40:02,688
Is there a gray area here?
Let me dispel it.

625
00:40:02,855 --> 00:40:04,815
You stay away from me.
You stay away from my son.

626
00:40:04,982 --> 00:40:06,858
You don't look at him.
You don't talk to him.

627
00:40:07,025 --> 00:40:09,610
From now on,
my family is off-limits to you.

628
00:40:11,945 --> 00:40:13,781
Lori, I don't think that's fair.

629
00:40:13,947 --> 00:40:16,908
- Shane, shut up. Don't! ( slapping )
- I don't think that--

630
00:40:17,074 --> 00:40:20,453
My husband is back.
He is alive.

631
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:23,247
He's my best friend.

632
00:40:23,414 --> 00:40:26,125
Do you think
I'm not happy about that?

633
00:40:26,292 --> 00:40:28,294
How dare you?
Why would you be?

634
00:40:28,461 --> 00:40:31,798
You are the one that
told me that he died.

635
00:40:33,674 --> 00:40:35,760
You son of a bitch.

636
00:40:44,602 --> 00:40:46,437
( shuffling footsteps )

637
00:40:53,361 --> 00:40:55,988
( growling )

638
00:41:02,954 --> 00:41:06,707
Damn. You are one ugly skank.

639
00:41:10,503 --> 00:41:12,171
( thuds )

640
00:41:26,477 --> 00:41:28,479
( scrubbing )

641
00:41:32,316 --> 00:41:33,568
Ed, tell you what--

642
00:41:33,734 --> 00:41:35,528
you don't like how
your laundry is done,

643
00:41:35,695 --> 00:41:38,864
you are welcome to pitch in
and do it yourself. Here.

644
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:41,700
- Oh!
- Ed: Ain't my job, missy.

645
00:41:41,867 --> 00:41:43,869
- Andrea, don't.
- What is your job, Ed?

646
00:41:44,035 --> 00:41:45,745
Sitting on your ass
smoking cigarettes?

647
00:41:45,912 --> 00:41:46,996
Well, it sure as hell
ain't listening

648
00:41:47,162 --> 00:41:48,454
to some uppity
smart-mouthed bitch.

649
00:41:48,621 --> 00:41:51,833
Tell you what--
come on. Let's go.

650
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,002
I don't think she needs
to go anywhere with you, Ed.

651
00:41:54,168 --> 00:41:56,212
And I say it's none of your business.
Come on now.

652
00:41:56,379 --> 00:41:58,214
- You heard me.
- Carol.

653
00:41:58,381 --> 00:42:00,383
Andrea, please.
It doesn't matter.

654
00:42:00,550 --> 00:42:03,052
Hey, don't think
I won't knock you on your ass

655
00:42:03,219 --> 00:42:04,887
just â€˜cause you're some
college-educated cooze,

656
00:42:05,053 --> 00:42:06,555
- All right?
- ( gasps )

657
00:42:06,722 --> 00:42:09,224
Now you come on now
or you gonna regret it later.

658
00:42:09,391 --> 00:42:11,560
So she can show up
with fresh bruises later, Ed?

659
00:42:11,727 --> 00:42:13,562
- Yeah, we've seen them.
- ( laughs )

660
00:42:13,729 --> 00:42:15,772
Stay out of this.
Now come on!

661
00:42:15,939 --> 00:42:18,233
You know what?
This ain't none of y'all's business.

662
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,861
You don't want to keep prodding
the bull here, okay?

663
00:42:21,028 --> 00:42:23,405
Now I am done talking.
Come on.

664
00:42:23,572 --> 00:42:25,699
- No no. Carol, you don't have--
- ( Carol mutters )

665
00:42:25,866 --> 00:42:28,201
You don't tell me what!
I tell you what!

666
00:42:28,368 --> 00:42:30,370
( clamoring )

667
00:42:30,537 --> 00:42:32,456
- You think you can--
- Amy: Get off her!

668
00:42:32,623 --> 00:42:34,291
- Ed: Come here! Come here!
- Amy: Get off her!

669
00:42:34,458 --> 00:42:37,043
- Get off her! Get off her!
- Ed: Get off me!

670
00:42:37,209 --> 00:42:39,295
- ( Ed grunting )
- Carol: Ed?

671
00:42:39,462 --> 00:42:41,589
- Amy: It's okay. It's okay.
- Carol: No!

672
00:42:42,757 --> 00:42:44,216
- It's okay.
- No!

673
00:42:55,728 --> 00:42:57,730
- ( women yelling )
- Amy: Shane, stop!

674
00:42:57,897 --> 00:42:59,315
Just stop!

675
00:43:00,483 --> 00:43:02,860
Carol:
Stop it!

676
00:43:03,027 --> 00:43:04,862
- Stop!
- You put your hands on your wife,

677
00:43:05,029 --> 00:43:06,821
your little girl
or anybody else in this camp

678
00:43:06,988 --> 00:43:09,199
one more time, I will not stop
next time. Do you hear me?

679
00:43:09,366 --> 00:43:11,117
- Do you hear me?!
- ( slurs ) Yes.

680
00:43:11,284 --> 00:43:12,994
- I'll beat you to death, Ed.
- Carol: Ed!

681
00:43:13,161 --> 00:43:15,789
- I'll beat you to death.
- ( Carol crying ) Oh God!

682
00:43:15,956 --> 00:43:17,332
No.

683
00:43:17,499 --> 00:43:19,960
- God!
- ( grunts )

684
00:43:21,168 --> 00:43:23,963
( crying )
Ed, I'm sorry.

685
00:43:24,129 --> 00:43:27,800
Oh my God. Ed, I'm sorry.

686
00:43:28,926 --> 00:43:31,804
I'm so sorry, Ed.

687
00:43:31,971 --> 00:43:34,390
