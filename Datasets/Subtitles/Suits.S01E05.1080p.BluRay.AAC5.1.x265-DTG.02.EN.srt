00:00:12,345 --> 00:00:15,931
Ross. Triple double. Courtesy
of America's favorite burger chain.

2
00:00:16,057 --> 00:00:17,516
Louis won
the class action suit?

3
00:00:17,642 --> 00:00:19,893
Ten thousand men of Harvard

4
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,479
Want vict'ry today,

5
00:00:22,605 --> 00:00:24,898
For they know
that o'er old Eli

6
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:28,235
Fair Harvard holds sway

7
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:31,238
So then we'll conquer
all old Eli's men

8
00:00:32,073 --> 00:00:33,657
My favorite part.

9
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:37,494
You don't know the lyrics,
do you?

10
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:40,039
I don't even know the lyrics,
Louis.

11
00:00:40,165 --> 00:00:42,082
Now,
are we practicing law down here

12
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:44,043
or auditioning
a chorus line?

13
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:45,586
It's called
esprit de corps.

14
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:47,963
And I just got a $100 million
jury award overturned.

15
00:00:48,089 --> 00:00:49,757
I don't have
to overturn awards like that

16
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:53,135
because I've never lost one
in the first place.

17
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:57,056
So, what is this? A new cologne?
Or just a hint of jealousy?

18
00:00:57,182 --> 00:01:00,184
I'm surprised you, uh,
don't recognize your wife's perfume.

19
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:02,436
I know.
You're not married.

20
00:01:03,354 --> 00:01:05,230
It's still funny.

21
00:01:05,356 --> 00:01:08,442
You do realize we're celebrating
making fat people even fatter, right?

22
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:11,528
If you wanted to do good,
you should have been a fake doctor.

23
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:15,240
Business cards.

24
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:18,619
- Yep.
- My mistake is now official.

25
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:20,120
Come with me.

26
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:24,124
And learn the goddamn lyrics
to the Harvard song, will you?

27
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:28,712
Oakhurst Capital has agreed
to a $200 million licensing deal.

28
00:01:28,838 --> 00:01:29,963
We are at the goal line.

29
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,465
How are we
on brand protection?

30
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:32,800
The contract is airtight.

31
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:36,386
The only issue here is to get
the Joyful Toy Company to close.

32
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:38,263
I'll go over it with
Joy one-on-one.

33
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:46,647
Protocol in a meeting
is to put your phone on silent.

34
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:47,940
Oh. Uh...

35
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:50,609
If it does ring,
you answer it.

36
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:53,278
Not in here.

37
00:01:55,031 --> 00:01:57,199
Don't feel the need to rush back
when you're done.

38
00:01:57,325 --> 00:01:58,158
Who is this?

39
00:01:58,284 --> 00:01:59,868
Dude, it's Trevor.
Don't hang up.

40
00:01:59,994 --> 00:02:02,996
Look, I only get one call.
I'm in jail.

41
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:05,624
I tried to hop this bus
at Port Authority. I was drunk.

42
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:09,294
It's all messed up. Look, I know
we haven't talked since we fought.

43
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:12,005
But I didn't know
who else to call.

44
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:23,142
I'm sorry, man.

45
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:24,893
I'm sorry.

46
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:28,188
Okay.

47
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:30,357
I'm going to
pay you back.

48
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:34,278
Good. Your bail
cost me everything I had in the bank.

49
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:36,905
The thing is,
I don't have the money.

50
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:38,615
What are you talking about?

51
00:02:38,741 --> 00:02:40,701
You were clearing $10,000
a month selling weed.

52
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:43,328
It went out
as fast as it came in.

53
00:02:43,454 --> 00:02:44,496
Came in?

54
00:02:44,622 --> 00:02:47,207
I quit.
I'm not dealing anymore.

55
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:48,208
Bullshit.

56
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:50,669
I'm serious.
After we fought,

57
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:54,840
things just started
to fall apart.

58
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:57,050
Jenny broke up with me.

59
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:00,762
I didn't know.

60
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:03,807
Well, I just realized
I needed to make a change.

61
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:05,726
I even sold my bong.

62
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:08,812
What have you done
with my friend?

63
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:10,939
You should talk.
Look at you.

64
00:03:11,065 --> 00:03:12,482
You look like
Gordon Gekko's little brother.

65
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:15,360
- Okay.
- Are you working on Wall Street, man?

66
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:19,573
Why did you call me, Trevor?

67
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,243
You're the one person
I knew would show up.

68
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:26,872
You want to ask me
for anything?

69
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:27,831
Else?

70
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:31,460
Look. All I care about right now
is keeping my record clean.

71
00:03:33,838 --> 00:03:36,506
You don't happen to know
any good lawyers, do you?

72
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:41,470
No. I don't.

73
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:46,391
See the money,
wanna stay for your meal

74
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:49,853
Get another piece of pie
for your wife

75
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:53,232
Everybody wanna know
how it feel

76
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:56,485
Everybody wanna see
what it's like

77
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:59,905
I'll even eat a bean pie
I don't mind

78
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:01,573
Me and missy is so early

79
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:03,450
Busy, busy making money

80
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:04,826
All right!

81
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:09,665
All step back
I'm 'bout to dance

82
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:12,834
The greenback boogie

83
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:27,766
Why the rush now?

84
00:04:27,892 --> 00:04:30,018
You've already wasted
ten minutes of my life.

85
00:04:30,144 --> 00:04:32,521
Please tell me you didn't wait
ten minutes just to scold me.

86
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:34,773
I've been waiting for you
to bring the paperwork down

87
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:37,693
so I can close
a nine-figure licensing deal.

88
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:40,279
If your phone rings
while I'm talking to Ray,

89
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:44,074
I'm throwing it out of the car
while it's attached to your hand.

90
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:46,618
Eddie Hope
and the Mannish Boys.

91
00:04:46,744 --> 00:04:48,745
1959. Three guesses.

92
00:04:48,871 --> 00:04:50,038
Guesses?

93
00:04:50,164 --> 00:04:52,874
Won't be a fool no more

94
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:55,919
You insult me, Harvey.

95
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:58,797
Don't worry, we won't be late.

96
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:09,016
Okay. What was the name
of the record label?

97
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:10,600
Marlin Records.

98
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:12,477
Who covered it
in the late '60s?

99
00:05:12,603 --> 00:05:15,689
Ah, I want to say
The Stones, but...

100
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:16,940
You need some guesses?

101
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:18,233
Oh!

102
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:19,359
Oh, my God.

103
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:25,824
Just like
a private car service, huh?

104
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,409
Thinking you don't
have to yield?

105
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:29,077
What? Yield?

106
00:05:29,203 --> 00:05:30,329
You ran a red light.

107
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:32,080
That light was yellow.

108
00:05:32,206 --> 00:05:34,958
- No, sir, it was not.
- Are you calling me a liar?

109
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:36,418
- Back off.
- Mind your business, okay?

110
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:37,502
Oh, I'm minding
my business.

111
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:38,628
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

112
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:41,631
Anyone throws a punch, I'm going
to introduce you to Mr. Taser.

113
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:44,384
Trade insurance.
I'll take reports one at a time.

114
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,845
As much as I'd like to help you out,
I'm late for a meeting.

115
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:50,849
Oh, no. You're not going anywhere.
I need a statement from you, too.

116
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:53,060
Here is my information.

117
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:56,063
I need you to babysit the client
until I get there.

118
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:57,147
Don't mention the deal.

119
00:05:57,273 --> 00:05:58,357
She asks any questions,

120
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:00,650
just nod your head
and look pretty.

121
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:16,917
Ms. McAfee. I'm Mike Ross.
I work with Harvey.

122
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:20,045
Oh. You're the protégé
that he's been gushing about.

123
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:21,046
He was gushing?

124
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:22,798
Well, he mentioned
that you existed.

125
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:24,299
For Harvey, that's gushing.

126
00:06:24,425 --> 00:06:27,719
Uh, he's running
a few minutes late today. Car trouble.

127
00:06:27,845 --> 00:06:29,763
I was just about to
have tea with the girls.

128
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:31,181
Would you care to join me?

129
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:33,141
- I'd love to.
- Good.

130
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:36,395
And for heaven's sakes,
call me Joy.

131
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:37,354
Okay, Joy.

132
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,607
These are the girls.

133
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:45,821
Susie, Sarah, Stacy,
Sinclair, and Sabrina.

134
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:50,450
Susie, where are your manners?
Shake hands with this nice young man.

135
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:59,418
Just kidding.
I know they're dolls.

136
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:00,377
Oh.

137
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:02,546
They're named
after my daughters.

138
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:04,965
I started the company
because of them, really.

139
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:08,760
You know, dolls didn't used
to be these cheap, plastic bimbos

140
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:10,679
from China
that we have today.

141
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:13,223
Your mother made them
for you by hand.

142
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:16,476
I wanted my girls to have
that same experience.

143
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:18,979
And here we are,
thirty years later.

144
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:20,814
Every parent's
worst nightmare.

145
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:21,773
What do you mean?

146
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:25,569
These little angels,
they sell for $90 a pop.

147
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,612
I wasn't born with a butler,
you know.

148
00:07:27,738 --> 00:07:29,197
I've got to say,
this is amazing.

149
00:07:29,323 --> 00:07:31,366
Taking on a project
like a licensing deal.

150
00:07:31,492 --> 00:07:32,951
Why is that amazing?

151
00:07:33,077 --> 00:07:35,036
Well, my grandmother
could never pull this off.

152
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:38,081
She's been retired
for ten years.

153
00:07:38,499 --> 00:07:39,791
How is that
treating her?

154
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:42,377
She lives near my apartment.
I get to see her once a week. So...

155
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:43,837
That's very sweet of you.

156
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:46,089
No. No, it's not.

157
00:07:48,092 --> 00:07:52,220
You know, whenever I needed her,
she was there.

158
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:55,724
No matter what.
She'd give me a hug.

159
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:59,144
She'd tell me everything
was going to be alright.

160
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:01,897
Even if it wasn't.

161
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:04,024
And now that she needs me,

162
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,609
I am always at work.
And I'm...

163
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:11,907
I'm so sorry. Yeah.

164
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:14,701
Never answer your phone
in front of a client.

165
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:16,953
- But it's you.
- What's happening?

166
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:19,206
Well, actually,
we're in the middle of a tea party.

167
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,708
I knew you were
the doll-playing type.

168
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:23,126
Put Joy on.

169
00:08:23,544 --> 00:08:25,837
Ms. McAfee. It's Harvey.

170
00:08:25,963 --> 00:08:26,963
Oh.

171
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:30,550
Oh. Joy, I'm sorry.
I have to reschedule.

172
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:32,219
No need to apologize.

173
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:34,471
I like this one.

174
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:36,640
I'll send him back after tea.

175
00:08:48,402 --> 00:08:50,445
Tell me you didn't ask
our client for a doggie bag.

176
00:08:50,571 --> 00:08:53,156
What can I say?
Stacy insisted.

177
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:56,910
I just got off with
Joy McAfee's general counsel.

178
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:58,411
It seems
she had an epiphany.

179
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,872
She wants less on her plate,
not more.

180
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:03,041
I thought you were
going to close her.

181
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:05,001
We need that doll money.

182
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:06,044
I'm on top of it.

183
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:07,879
Harvey, it took five months
to structure that deal.

184
00:09:08,005 --> 00:09:10,382
Please don't make me
set fire to your desk.

185
00:09:11,842 --> 00:09:12,926
I...

186
00:09:13,427 --> 00:09:16,137
All you had to do
was have tea with the dolls.

187
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:18,974
Donna, schedule another tea party
with Joy as soon as possible.

188
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,433
And text me
the names of her girls.

189
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,144
Oh, what a shock. You can't keep
girls' names straight in your head.

190
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:24,729
Just yours, Debbie.

191
00:09:24,855 --> 00:09:27,065
See, that's funny because
your name is Donna.

192
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:31,987
Harvey Specter.
I got your order right here.

193
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:33,321
I didn't order a pizza.

194
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:35,365
You've been served.

195
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:42,622
The cab driver who hit Ray
named me as a witness in a civil suit.

196
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:44,249
I need to pay
Travis Bickle a visit.

197
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:45,542
Harvey, if you let me
go talk to Joy,

198
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:46,710
- I know I can fix this.
- No.

199
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:48,545
You don't send a puppy
to clean up its own mess.

200
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:50,630
Optimally,
you don't even have a puppy.

201
00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:01,683
Ross. Rumor has it you talked
a client out of $200 million.

202
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:04,436
The deal's not off the table, all right?
It's just a speed bump.

203
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:06,229
Dude, I think we just found
him a new nickname.

204
00:10:06,355 --> 00:10:08,273
Speed Bump.

205
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,400
I feel like I'm back
in high school.

206
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:13,028
They called you
Speed Bump in high school?

207
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:16,239
Kidding. But if you need
any boxes to pack up your office...

208
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:17,991
Ah. Wait a minute.

209
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:21,494
There.
I think that belongs to you.

210
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:24,164
It wouldn't hurt so much
if you had thicker skin.

211
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:34,049
What do you want?

212
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,092
I want to pay you back
for posting bail.

213
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:38,428
Trevor, you've owed me forty bucks
since fifth grade.

214
00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:39,846
I wrote it off. Okay?

215
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:41,931
Look, I want a clean slate.
Okay?

216
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:44,684
So, you don't want to see me,
I'll mail you a check.

217
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:48,813
Okay.

218
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:51,316
Yeah. Let's hang out
tomorrow night.

219
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:53,485
Nothing crazy, though, all right?
I have to be up early.

220
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:56,112
We can crochet pantyhose
if that's what it takes to be cool.

221
00:10:56,238 --> 00:10:57,530
I think we can do
a little better than that.

222
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:01,284
Why don't we, uh...
Why don't we say Rex's, 7:30?

223
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:02,827
First six rounds are on me.

224
00:11:02,953 --> 00:11:04,454
If you're serious
about paying me back,

225
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,373
the first hundred rounds
are on you.

226
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:29,604
Oh, it's the tough guy.

227
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:33,525
This is a matter
for insurance.

228
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:34,943
Not a frivolous lawsuit.

229
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:37,570
You know, for your information,
I suffered emotional pain.

230
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:38,905
Emotional pain?

231
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:41,533
Rub this
on your emotional pain.

232
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:44,202
You condescending
son of a...

233
00:11:44,328 --> 00:11:46,788
Look at me.
I am going to warn you once.

234
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:48,540
Do not pursue this matter.

235
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:51,835
You know, I have been
held up at gunpoint three times.

236
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:54,421
So, do you think a fancy suit
and a $500 haircut,

237
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:55,505
that's going to scare me?

238
00:11:55,631 --> 00:11:56,840
You take my driver to court,

239
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:58,925
I'm going to
represent him myself.

240
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:00,385
And when you lose,

241
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:01,511
you'll be covering my fee.

242
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:03,346
Which is going to be
a hell of a lot of haircuts.

243
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:06,391
Mmm. So you weren't
a one-way fare.

244
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:07,851
Ray's worked for me
eight years.

245
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:09,602
Then you don't have to worry
about being a witness.

246
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:11,187
Because as his employer,

247
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:13,565
you're liable
for his actions.

248
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:18,027
You know, I think you've seen
way too many reruns of Ally McBeal.

249
00:12:18,612 --> 00:12:20,655
You know, I immigrated here
after September 11.

250
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:22,657
And they shut the doors
on everybody.

251
00:12:22,783 --> 00:12:23,825
I couldn't pay
for a lawyer,

252
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:25,910
so I had to take them
to court.

253
00:12:26,036 --> 00:12:27,704
I sued for my citizenship.

254
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:32,041
So I have a very special appreciation
for the law.

255
00:12:32,376 --> 00:12:34,711
I appreciate
a good single malt.

256
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:37,130
I don't pretend
I can make one.

257
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:40,550
I wiped the floor
with the US government, Counselor.

258
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:43,470
I'm going to do
the same with you.

259
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:02,030
Ray.
Donna.

260
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:04,073
What are you doing here?
I don't have you scheduled.

261
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,867
Uh, I need to see Harvey.

262
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:07,160
Oh, come on.
You know the rules.

263
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:08,912
No one sets foot in there
without a warrant,

264
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:10,455
a Papal edict,
or my say-so.

265
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:12,999
I just got named
in a multi-million dollar lawsuit.

266
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,250
The accident
wasn't my fault.

267
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:15,251
Can I get in to see Harvey,
please?

268
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:17,712
Okay, say no more.
I will get you in.

269
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:20,298
You are so beautiful
when you're forceful.

270
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:22,509
I know you meant that
as a compliment,

271
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:25,970
but I don't appreciate limitations
being placed on my beauty.

272
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:31,267
Harvey. I'm already losing money
with the car in the shop.

273
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:33,019
A trial means
I can't work.

274
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:35,647
And how do you think my name is going
to play in front of a New York jury?

275
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:36,940
Rahim Benghazi?

276
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:38,775
I may as well buy
a one-way ticket to Guantanamo.

277
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:39,901
Not going to happen.

278
00:13:40,027 --> 00:13:42,904
If I lose, I won't even
be able to afford a livery license,

279
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,364
let alone my insurance.

280
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,741
That's why I'm going to be
defending both of us.

281
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:49,077
Ray, this goes against
every fiber of my being.

282
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:51,746
I'm taking your case.
Pro bono.

283
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:54,874
I don't know what to say.

284
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,293
Absolutely nothing.
I've got a reputation to maintain.

285
00:13:57,419 --> 00:13:59,462
Besides, it's not going
to take long. Okay?

286
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:01,339
I'm going to get
it dismissed.

287
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:04,926
Donna, call the court.
We need priority status on the docket.

288
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:06,886
Yeah. I already tried.

289
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:09,138
You drew Judge Palermo.

290
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:11,015
You know what you have to do,
don't you?

291
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:15,645
Yeah. The other thing that goes against
every fiber of my being.

292
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:19,566
Louis, has anyone told you
you're an exquisite soprano?

293
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:21,109
What do you want, Harvey?

294
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:23,361
You're right.
Why prolong my suffering?

295
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:25,697
I need you to get me in
to see Judge Palermo.

296
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:28,116
You need my help,

297
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:30,577
and you're not going
to pull rank on me?

298
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:37,500
Your case has nothing
to do with firm business, does it?

299
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:38,626
What's it
going to take?

300
00:14:38,752 --> 00:14:41,254
A mani-pedi?
Tickets to Celine?

301
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:43,548
I'll see what I can do.

302
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:45,508
And your pound of flesh?

303
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:47,135
I need my back scratched,
I'll let you know.

304
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:50,471
Louis, unless that's a metaphor,
the deal's off.

305
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:52,140
Huh.

306
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:55,810
Joy, when I told you that
my grandmother didn't have much time,

307
00:14:55,936 --> 00:14:59,314
I didn't realize that
she's 15 years older than you.

308
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,065
Now how do you know
how old I am?

309
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:03,693
That is a very closely
guarded secret.

310
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,029
I did some research.

311
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:07,655
Very resourceful.

312
00:15:07,781 --> 00:15:10,575
I did it to assure myself
that you can handle a heavier workload.

313
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:12,076
I appreciate that.

314
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:13,661
But I'm not worried
about my health.

315
00:15:13,787 --> 00:15:15,121
Is it the money?

316
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:17,123
Because I can guarantee
$200 million upfront

317
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:19,500
is just a tenth of what you stand
to make on this deal.

318
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:23,087
Michael, my dolls eat better
than most people.

319
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:24,547
I've got plenty of money.

320
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:29,010
This deal meant staying on for five
more years and doubling my workload.

321
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:36,517
I am going to take my grandchildren
on a cruise to Tahiti.

322
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:37,936
Tahiti?

323
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:40,563
You know the licensing agreement
includes a theme park.

324
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:42,231
You could take them there.

325
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:44,108
It's not about the deal.

326
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:47,987
I have had this same view
for 25 years.

327
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:50,073
I need a change of scenery.

328
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:51,240
I'm going to speak to Harvey

329
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:54,744
and I'm going to tell him
that I want to sell the whole business.

330
00:15:56,789 --> 00:16:00,249
So I just spoke to
Judge Palermo.

331
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:01,960
And because he thinks
I'm a good guy

332
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:04,712
and I told him
I'd owe him one,

333
00:16:04,838 --> 00:16:07,715
your case is going to be moved up.
Way ahead.

334
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:08,883
Back scratch.

335
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:10,176
I don't have a first born,
you know.

336
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:11,886
So what exactly
do you want for that?

337
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:16,140
- No, you're not getting one of my ties.
- No.

338
00:16:16,892 --> 00:16:19,268
Your shoulder?
What... Your lapel...

339
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:22,647
Donna?

340
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:23,773
God.

341
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:25,984
Norma is going to Istanbul
for two weeks.

342
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,694
And you know that
I'm not good with temps.

343
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,654
My God.
Ask me for something else.

344
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,406
Harvey,
this is non-negotiable.

345
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:32,573
You owe me now.

346
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,450
Donna is one thing
that I can't give you.

347
00:16:34,576 --> 00:16:35,410
Why not?

348
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:37,495
For one thing,
she'd never agree to it.

349
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:39,539
You're her boss.
You just tell her to do stuff.

350
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:40,873
I don't tell her
to do anything.

351
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:41,916
She just does.

352
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:44,627
All right, fine. You know what?
That's just not a problem.

353
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:47,380
I will call Judge Palermo,
and I'll tell him I was mistaken.

354
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:49,090
And then,
your hearing will be in,

355
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:51,009
I don't know,
maybe six months?

356
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:53,011
I tell you what.

357
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:54,679
If you can convince
her yourself,

358
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:56,180
you have my blessing.

359
00:16:56,306 --> 00:16:59,767
She's going to love me so much,
you're going to fight to get her back.

360
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:05,982
Hi, Donna.

361
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:08,443
Harvey and I were just
talking about you.

362
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:09,694
No.

363
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:13,072
You don't even know
what I was going to say.

364
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:14,615
Yes, I do.

365
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:17,201
And how is that possible?

366
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:19,829
I read lips.
I know body language.

367
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:21,622
And I talk to Norma.

368
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:28,337
I'm not some token
you win at a fair, Louis.

369
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:29,756
You... I know you're not.
You're not a token.

370
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:31,966
- I'm a human being, and I just...
- Yes, you are.

371
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:33,843
I'm sorry. I just...

372
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:40,099
You know what?
That just made me feel really... cheap.

373
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:41,851
No, I'm just trying to tell you
that you're really good

374
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:42,894
at what you do, Donna.

375
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:43,978
So I'm going
to ask you...

376
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:47,440
It's like my soul hurts now.

377
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,734
No. Donna, listen.

378
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,152
Even if your soul hurts
a little bit...

379
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:52,236
I'm sorry.

380
00:17:52,654 --> 00:17:54,530
It's okay.
It's going to be fine.

381
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:57,116
Don't cry.
Please don't cry, Donna.

382
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:58,326
Oh, shit.

383
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:06,542
I think I owe you one for that.
That was fun.

384
00:18:06,668 --> 00:18:07,752
Wait a second.

385
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:09,754
The time that you cried

386
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,840
and then I let your parents
stay at my condo?

387
00:18:12,966 --> 00:18:13,800
Yep.

388
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:23,601
So you don't want
to talk about it?

389
00:18:23,727 --> 00:18:24,811
What is there
to talk about?

390
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:26,854
I did exactly
what my boss told me not to do,

391
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,773
and it blew up
in my face.

392
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:31,484
Dude, I told you
I'm taking care of this.

393
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:34,195
For my last few hours of employment,
please, I should pay.

394
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:35,822
Put the wallet away.

395
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:37,115
Ooh.

396
00:18:37,991 --> 00:18:39,659
Dude, this is epic.

397
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:42,620
This is the scam
we always talked about.

398
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:44,247
God, I bet you're getting
laid left and right.

399
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:45,873
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

400
00:18:45,999 --> 00:18:47,959
You lose appreciation after a while.
Come on.

401
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:49,961
Why did you put a phone number
on there?

402
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:51,712
It's a real firm.

403
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:54,632
Oh, yeah? Huh.

404
00:18:54,758 --> 00:18:55,925
What are you doing?

405
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:58,344
Oh, I'm just calling
the employee directory.

406
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,888
- It's part of the scam, man.
- They'll check your story.

407
00:19:01,014 --> 00:19:01,848
- Stop it.
- What?

408
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,266
- Trevor, stop. Hang up the phone.
- No.

409
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:04,851
- Trevor, hang up the phone. Stop.
- What?

410
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:05,977
All right? I'm working there.

411
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:08,062
Oh, yeah.
What, as a lawyer?

412
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:12,775
Are you...
Dude.

413
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:13,818
It's a long story. Okay?

414
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:16,612
But you can't tell anyone.
Ever. Okay?

415
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:18,573
That is awesome.

416
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:22,660
Man, I always said that if you quit
smoking pot, you could do it.

417
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:24,537
Yeah. Yeah. Oh, that's right.
Yeah, you did.

418
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:27,123
Right before
you passed me the bowl.

419
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:31,002
What?

420
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:32,837
No, I just...

421
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:35,798
I wish you trusted me enough
to tell me.

422
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:39,051
I mean, all I did was
set you up on a drug bust.

423
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:40,761
Oh, God.
That was too soon.

424
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:42,013
I'm sorry.

425
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:45,057
Hi, ladies. How are you?

426
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:46,475
Um, I want to
let you know,

427
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:49,270
if you, either of you,
ever get arrested for anything,

428
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:51,939
you call this guy.
He's the best attorney in the city.

429
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:54,859
What would we
get arrested for?

430
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:56,736
Um... I don't know.

431
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:58,654
What are you thinking
about doing?

432
00:20:05,495 --> 00:20:07,079
Uh, as your attorney,

433
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:09,916
I would definitely
advise you to do that.

434
00:20:11,835 --> 00:20:13,711
Uh, four more.

435
00:20:13,837 --> 00:20:14,754
Yeah.

436
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:24,597
I must warn you that representing
yourself at trial is not the...

437
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:25,723
What's he doing here?

438
00:20:25,849 --> 00:20:27,767
You think you can schedule a meeting
without me knowing it?

439
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:31,896
Oh, no. I'm privy to all communication
between you and the court.

440
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:33,731
Well, if your driving matched
your legal knowledge,

441
00:20:33,857 --> 00:20:35,066
we wouldn't be here.

442
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:38,027
Your Honor.
This case should be dismissed.

443
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:39,070
It's a matter for insurance.

444
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:40,696
Insurance only
covers repairs.

445
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:42,198
It does not deal
with my losses.

446
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:43,407
What losses?

447
00:20:44,701 --> 00:20:48,120
Because of that accident, I missed
my chance to get my Taxi Medallion.

448
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:49,705
Can't you just
buy it next year?

449
00:20:49,831 --> 00:20:51,874
The loan I got
expires in one week.

450
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,002
On top of that, a Medallion costs
$300,000 this go round.

451
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:56,963
Next year, $350,000.

452
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:59,048
So his entire claim
rests upon the assumption

453
00:20:59,174 --> 00:21:00,549
that he would have won
this year's Medallion.

454
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:04,428
The hallmark of America is that
the little guy gets to see justice done.

455
00:21:04,554 --> 00:21:06,430
We are all equals
in the eyes of the law.

456
00:21:06,556 --> 00:21:08,266
That is why, out of all
the countries in the world,

457
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:10,601
I chose to come here.

458
00:21:10,727 --> 00:21:12,353
What do you have to say about that,
Counselor?

459
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:14,522
I say Atticus Finch makes
a good speech here.

460
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:15,648
But this is a fender bender,

461
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:17,525
not a multi-million dollar law suit.

462
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:20,319
Vicarious liability
applies to discrimination,

463
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:22,071
harassment, and accidents.

464
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:26,409
Employers are responsible
for their employees' negligence.

465
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:28,202
The court finds
a reasonable suit here.

466
00:21:28,328 --> 00:21:30,371
Trial starts tomorrow.

467
00:21:30,497 --> 00:21:32,623
Thank you, Your Honor.

468
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:37,211
You're getting a good kick
out of this, aren't you?

469
00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:40,548
I am. But I'm taking
this on its merits.

470
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:42,258
And you better bring
your A game tomorrow,

471
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:44,593
because he's got
a legitimate claim.

472
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,847
He wants a trial,
I'll give him a goddamn trial.

473
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:49,265
Your Honor.

474
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:55,688
So, how many cases
have you won?

475
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:58,190
I only remember
how many I've lost.

476
00:21:58,817 --> 00:21:59,984
None.

477
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:03,779
Well, what happened
to the drinks?

478
00:22:03,905 --> 00:22:05,281
I got a better idea.

479
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:07,700
Let's say we get a bottle
and take the party back to your place.

480
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:09,618
Make it a bottle of Dom,
and you're on.

481
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:11,787
All right.
How about four bottles?

482
00:22:11,913 --> 00:22:13,039
Come on.

483
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:28,262
You guys want to get a cab?

484
00:22:28,388 --> 00:22:29,513
Definitely.

485
00:22:29,639 --> 00:22:31,807
Definitely.
Cab, four bottles of Dom...

486
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:32,892
You want to spend
any more of my money?

487
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:35,478
Just relax. Okay?
It's an investment in the evening.

488
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:38,022
And, uh, I just said
the thing about the bottles

489
00:22:38,148 --> 00:22:39,398
to get the girls
out of the bar.

490
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:42,193
Really? Because it looked like you were
trying to get away from those guys.

491
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:44,028
Taxi! What guys?

492
00:22:44,154 --> 00:22:45,196
The guys in the back.

493
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:46,864
You know what I'm talking about.
Come on. Who are they?

494
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:48,657
Look. Those two?
I... I... I don't know.

495
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:50,159
Where are all the cabs?

496
00:22:50,285 --> 00:22:51,786
Well, it looked like
they knew you.

497
00:22:51,912 --> 00:22:53,412
And not
in a very good way.

498
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:56,499
I... I don't know. Maybe they were,
uh, flirting with our dates. Okay?

499
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:59,168
I'd be pissed, too, if I watched
those legs walk away from me.

500
00:22:59,294 --> 00:23:00,211
How we doing, ladies?

501
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:01,712
My feet are killing me in these heels.

502
00:23:01,838 --> 00:23:03,214
- I'm sorry.
- Hey. Trevor. Come on.

503
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:04,632
- Taxi!
- Seriously. Stop playing with me.

504
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:05,925
What was that about back there?

505
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:08,052
Look, I'm not playing with you.
All right?

506
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:10,763
But just, if you play your cards right,
maybe you and, uh...

507
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:12,807
Maybe Marcella will...
Maybe she'll play with you.

508
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:14,016
Okay.

509
00:23:14,142 --> 00:23:16,560
Now, it's going to be a tight
squeeze. Who wants to sit on my lap?

510
00:23:21,274 --> 00:23:23,025
We don't go after him?

511
00:23:23,151 --> 00:23:25,820
No, we're going to get
to him through this guy.

512
00:24:08,155 --> 00:24:10,364
A-ha, just like
the good old days, huh?

513
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:13,784
Are you kidding me? This is
way better than the good old days.

514
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:16,328
I'm actually missing a shoe.

515
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:18,164
Hey, where are we?

516
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:19,707
Uh, I think we're in Hoboken.

517
00:24:34,514 --> 00:24:35,556
You wanted to see me?

518
00:24:35,682 --> 00:24:38,642
Did you go to see Joy
after I told you not to?

519
00:24:39,394 --> 00:24:40,644
How did you know?

520
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:44,398
I didn't. Until now.

521
00:24:44,941 --> 00:24:47,151
I told you.
A puppy can't clean up its own mess.

522
00:24:47,277 --> 00:24:50,321
Mess? All I did was tell her
about my grandmother.

523
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:52,656
Your job is to
make my life easier.

524
00:24:52,782 --> 00:24:55,534
If you can't understand that,
why did I hire you?

525
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,079
Police report summarized.

526
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:00,873
Traffic signal analysis.

527
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:04,210
Medallion bids,
attendees, and results.

528
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:05,377
That's why you hired me.

529
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:08,506
I thought you were all over
the Joy situation.

530
00:25:08,632 --> 00:25:11,342
Instead,
you're all over page six.

531
00:25:11,468 --> 00:25:13,761
You wanted me to do pro bono work.
This is it.

532
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:16,430
Pro bono enhances
a firm's image.

533
00:25:16,556 --> 00:25:20,017
This makes us look like wealthy bullies
against an everyman cabby.

534
00:25:20,143 --> 00:25:22,853
Does that seem like it
enhances our image to you?

535
00:25:22,979 --> 00:25:26,023
I refuse to answer that
on the grounds that I don't want to.

536
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:30,819
Someone had a fun night.

537
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:33,697
Answer another call
you shouldn't have?

538
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:35,866
I... I... I didn't...
I was...

539
00:25:35,992 --> 00:25:39,036
Piece of advice. When the big dog
asks the puppy something like that,

540
00:25:39,162 --> 00:25:40,621
it's a rhetorical question.

541
00:25:40,747 --> 00:25:41,997
Got it.

542
00:25:42,123 --> 00:25:43,582
Before you go...

543
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:47,127
The phone call. The other day
when you answered it during the meeting?

544
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:49,547
Yeah. I'm sorry about that.
It won't happen again.

545
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:50,965
Who was it?

546
00:25:52,175 --> 00:25:55,052
Um, it was just a friend.
You know, an emergency.

547
00:25:55,178 --> 00:25:57,513
- What kind of emergency?
- Um...

548
00:25:57,639 --> 00:26:01,392
Was it the friend who almost
got you busted for drug trafficking?

549
00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:03,269
That friend? Trevor?

550
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:05,062
He's not dealing anymore,
Harvey.

551
00:26:05,188 --> 00:26:07,731
So, it was him.
He called you from jail?

552
00:26:09,943 --> 00:26:13,195
You know, I make a living
learning how to read people, Mike.

553
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:16,407
So if I saw it,
Jessica did, too.

554
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:21,161
Is that the kind of impression
that you want to leave around here?

555
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:22,746
This guy
is not your friend.

556
00:26:22,872 --> 00:26:24,873
He is an anchor dragging you down.
Get rid of him.

557
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,459
He is my oldest friend,
Harvey.

558
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:29,211
I wasn't just going
to let him rot in jail.

559
00:26:29,337 --> 00:26:30,546
What's going to happen
the next time?

560
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:32,339
Because there will be
a next time.

561
00:26:32,465 --> 00:26:34,550
You going to bail him out?

562
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:36,093
Put yourself in jeopardy?

563
00:26:36,219 --> 00:26:38,554
You know, if it weren't for Trevor,
you and I never would have met.

564
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:41,849
Cut him loose.

565
00:26:46,354 --> 00:26:50,232
We're here to see Mike Ross.
He's an associate.

566
00:26:50,358 --> 00:26:53,360
His friend, Trevor, referred us.
Thank you.

567
00:26:57,407 --> 00:27:01,327
It looked like they knew you.
And not in a very good way.

568
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:50,834
Hey!

569
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:02,096
Excuse me. Officer.

570
00:28:02,597 --> 00:28:04,306
Is Central Park that way?

571
00:28:04,432 --> 00:28:05,599
Yeah,
just go right there.

572
00:28:05,725 --> 00:28:08,727
I'm sorry.
I'm really terrible with direction.

573
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:10,646
Is it this street
right here?

574
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:12,314
This street, yes.

575
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,399
- Right here.
- Yeah.

576
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:14,858
Okay.

577
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:23,409
Trevor, it's Mike.

578
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:26,537
Call me back. I need to know
what the hell is going on.

579
00:28:45,348 --> 00:28:47,391
Did you get
the red velvet cupcakes?

580
00:28:47,517 --> 00:28:49,727
Yes. Three dozen.
Extra icing.

581
00:28:51,271 --> 00:28:53,188
How the hell
did that happen?

582
00:28:53,314 --> 00:28:55,149
Okay. You know what?

583
00:28:57,527 --> 00:28:59,445
There. Problem solved.

584
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,614
I asked you
how'd you get that tear.

585
00:29:07,328 --> 00:29:09,788
A couple of guys
came to the firm.

586
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:12,875
They were looking for me.

587
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:15,335
I don't know
what they wanted,

588
00:29:15,462 --> 00:29:17,713
but I'm pretty sure it has something
to do with some shit Trevor did.

589
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:19,798
And that big brain of yours
doesn't remember me saying

590
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:20,883
to cut ties with that loser?

591
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:22,801
You know what? You've been
blowing off Joy's deal all week

592
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:24,428
for your friend, okay?
So, please.

593
00:29:24,554 --> 00:29:27,222
First of all,
Trevor is not your friend.

594
00:29:27,682 --> 00:29:29,600
You want to know
why I'm loyal to Ray?

595
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:32,895
I was taking a limo,
and I left $3,000 in it.

596
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:34,563
Ray happened to be
the driver.

597
00:29:34,689 --> 00:29:36,064
He found it
and tracked me down.

598
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:37,399
Not a nickel of it
was missing.

599
00:29:37,525 --> 00:29:40,235
And his first reaction
when this accident occurred

600
00:29:40,361 --> 00:29:41,528
was to ask if we were okay.

601
00:29:41,654 --> 00:29:43,822
Now, what would
Trevor's have been?

602
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:46,909
Cut him off.

603
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:49,119
And as far as
the licensing deal goes,

604
00:29:49,245 --> 00:29:52,164
just because you think I'm blowing
something off, doesn't mean I am.

605
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:53,791
Now watch and learn.

606
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:59,046
Everything's set
for you to walk away.

607
00:29:59,172 --> 00:30:01,882
We're selling
your stake as a block.

608
00:30:02,008 --> 00:30:05,302
Your headhunter is lining up
your replacement as we speak.

609
00:30:06,513 --> 00:30:10,098
Well, Harvey, this was
the most wonderful surprise.

610
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:13,268
You're a long-time client
who wants to be with her family.

611
00:30:13,394 --> 00:30:14,228
It was the least I could do.

612
00:30:14,354 --> 00:30:15,187
And you'll have...

613
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:16,730
...all the free time in the world
to spend with them.

614
00:30:16,856 --> 00:30:18,065
Joey broke the lamp.

615
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:19,775
Oh, that's great.

616
00:30:20,443 --> 00:30:22,444
Now, how soon
can we send them home?

617
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:25,739
They're booked on the first flight out
tomorrow morning.

618
00:30:25,865 --> 00:30:28,242
So when you had Donna
text you the girls' names...

619
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:29,785
I was talking about
her daughters.

620
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:31,453
And you were
going to fly them out all along.

621
00:30:31,579 --> 00:30:34,373
Do you remember when I said you don't
send a puppy to clean up its own mess?

622
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:35,916
Yes, Harvey. I do.

623
00:30:36,042 --> 00:30:37,876
I'm not a puppy.

624
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:41,338
Court will come to order.

625
00:30:41,464 --> 00:30:43,382
Mr. Santana,
your opening statement, please.

626
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:48,345
Driving a cab
isn't glamorous.

627
00:30:49,222 --> 00:30:50,973
But it's
an honest day's work.

628
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:52,975
Ever since I started,
I've looked forward to a time

629
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:56,937
when I could tell customers
that they were riding in my cab.

630
00:30:57,063 --> 00:30:59,314
That I was
an owner-operator.

631
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:03,193
So, I scrimped and I saved

632
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:06,738
until I finally had enough
put away to buy a Medallion.

633
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:12,035
But because of the actions
of these men,

634
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:16,039
I've lost that opportunity.

635
00:31:16,165 --> 00:31:20,127
So make no mistake. This trial
is not about a busted headlight.

636
00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:22,713
This is a trial
about a broken dream.

637
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:25,841
Forget the case.
They're going to make him President.

638
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:28,677
Statements are like free throws.
Easy.

639
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:31,513
Nobody's playing defense.

640
00:31:31,639 --> 00:31:33,974
Are we good at defense?

641
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:38,103
You would agree that chauffeured drivers
cause more accidents?

642
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:40,272
- Objection. Badgering.
- Sustained.

643
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:41,899
Objection. Argumentative.

644
00:31:42,025 --> 00:31:43,483
Leading the witness.
Ambiguous.

645
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:44,943
Privileged. Inflammatory.

646
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:47,070
Sustained.

647
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:49,281
Anything further,
Mr. Santana?

648
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:52,367
Yes, Your Honor.
I would like to call to the stand

649
00:31:52,827 --> 00:31:55,120
Mr. Michael Ross, please.

650
00:32:03,463 --> 00:32:06,381
What time had you called for the limo
on the morning of the accident?

651
00:32:06,507 --> 00:32:07,633
We were supposed to leave
at 8:30.

652
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:09,092
And what time
did you get to work?

653
00:32:09,218 --> 00:32:10,802
Objection. Irrelevant.

654
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:12,346
It's highly relevant,
Your Honor.

655
00:32:12,472 --> 00:32:16,725
It speaks to the psychology
of the driver, Rahim Benghazi.

656
00:32:16,851 --> 00:32:19,853
Overruled.
Answer Mr. Santana's question.

657
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:21,438
8:40.

658
00:32:21,564 --> 00:32:24,942
So unless Mr. Benghazi
made up for that lost time,

659
00:32:25,068 --> 00:32:28,153
you were going to be late
for that meeting. Correct?

660
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:34,576
Yes.

661
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:37,913
No further questions,
Your Honor.

662
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,586
When the accident occurred, you were
on your way to the Medallion auction.

663
00:32:44,712 --> 00:32:47,005
When and where was this auction
to take place?

664
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:48,840
9:00 a.m., City Hall.

665
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:50,842
According to
the police report,

666
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:55,138
the accident occurred
at 8:53 a.m.

667
00:32:55,264 --> 00:32:58,642
That means you only had seven minutes
to get downtown in rush hour traffic.

668
00:32:58,768 --> 00:33:00,268
Objection. Irrelevant.

669
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:02,312
I believe when I made
the same objection,

670
00:33:02,438 --> 00:33:04,314
you told his Honor
it was highly relevant.

671
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,899
Overruled.

672
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:08,485
You were running late.

673
00:33:08,611 --> 00:33:10,779
Only the stakes for you
were much higher, weren't they?

674
00:33:10,905 --> 00:33:13,281
These things
never start on time.

675
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:16,868
Then, why was the first Medallion
sold at 9:03 a.m?

676
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:20,914
You were scared your chance
at a Medallion was going up in smoke,

677
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,499
and you ran a red.

678
00:33:22,625 --> 00:33:26,169
Then, you used the accident
to paint me and Ray Benghazi

679
00:33:26,295 --> 00:33:27,462
as a couple of scapegoats.

680
00:33:27,588 --> 00:33:28,672
You can't prove that.

681
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:29,798
What color was the light?

682
00:33:29,924 --> 00:33:31,258
I take the Fifth.

683
00:33:31,384 --> 00:33:32,843
You can't take the Fifth,
Mr. Santana.

684
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:34,636
This isn't a criminal case.

685
00:33:35,138 --> 00:33:36,805
What color was the light?

686
00:33:36,931 --> 00:33:38,598
He cut me off.

687
00:33:38,725 --> 00:33:40,350
You claim to love
our legal system so much,

688
00:33:40,476 --> 00:33:41,435
answer the question.

689
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:47,607
What color was the light?

690
00:33:51,237 --> 00:33:53,989
- Your Honor?
- Answer the question, Mr. Santana.

691
00:33:57,952 --> 00:34:02,998
It just meant so much to me.

692
00:34:07,253 --> 00:34:10,672
Your Honor?
Can I sidebar with opposing counsel?

693
00:34:12,675 --> 00:34:16,428
We can roll the dice with the jury,
but I'd rather settle.

694
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:19,389
- How much would I have to pay?
- Nothing.

695
00:34:19,515 --> 00:34:21,433
You take responsibility
for the accident,

696
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:23,685
and your insurance company
makes Ray whole.

697
00:34:23,811 --> 00:34:27,189
In return,
I waive my right to collect legal fees.

698
00:34:31,652 --> 00:34:32,819
I don't know what to say.

699
00:34:32,945 --> 00:34:34,780
Don't say anything.

700
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:37,074
I've got a reputation
to maintain.

701
00:34:38,034 --> 00:34:39,659
That goes for you, too,
Judge.

702
00:34:55,218 --> 00:34:57,636
Damn it, Trevor.
I left you, like, five messages.

703
00:34:57,762 --> 00:35:00,931
Good to know your boy's flaky
with everyone. I was taking it personal.

704
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:07,270
What do you want?

705
00:35:07,396 --> 00:35:10,232
Well, Trevor owes us $50,000.
He's never paid,

706
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:11,775
so you're going
to bail him out.

707
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:15,028
Listen, I don't have that kind of money.
Okay? I can't.

708
00:35:15,154 --> 00:35:17,114
Well, if you're not down here
in an hour with it,

709
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,740
we're going to take it out
on Trevor.

710
00:35:18,866 --> 00:35:21,284
Tell him where the money is.

711
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:22,994
Whatever you do,
don't show up.

712
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:25,497
Trevor.

713
00:35:26,332 --> 00:35:27,916
You have one hour.

714
00:35:28,042 --> 00:35:30,377
Hello? Hello.

715
00:35:41,013 --> 00:35:43,515
What do you think you're doing,
leaving in the middle of a trial?

716
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:44,933
I've got some things
to take care of.

717
00:35:45,059 --> 00:35:47,352
You mean someone
to take care of.

718
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:48,895
You never cut Trevor off,
did you?

719
00:35:49,021 --> 00:35:51,481
No, I didn't. My friend's in trouble,
and I'm going to help him.

720
00:35:51,607 --> 00:35:53,441
You know what?
This is what addicts do.

721
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:55,986
The second they start making progress,
they screw up.

722
00:35:56,112 --> 00:35:58,655
Because deep down, they think it's
only a matter of time until they fail.

723
00:35:58,781 --> 00:36:00,782
They'd rather fall from
the third floor than the penthouse.

724
00:36:00,908 --> 00:36:02,534
Nothing you say
can stop me.

725
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,911
Then tell me
what the hell is going on.

726
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:14,171
He's clean. No wires.

727
00:36:14,297 --> 00:36:15,547
You sure?

728
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:17,174
Yeah, I'm sure.

729
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:19,009
Remember what happened
with the guy.

730
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:20,719
He was 300 pounds.

731
00:36:21,637 --> 00:36:22,971
Now who did you say
you were again?

732
00:36:23,097 --> 00:36:24,556
Trevor's lawyer.

733
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:26,099
Trevor didn't
mention a lawyer.

734
00:36:26,225 --> 00:36:28,435
He doesn't know
he hired me.

735
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:30,645
Come on.

736
00:36:32,231 --> 00:36:34,149
Open the briefcase.

737
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:42,199
Where's the goddamn money?

738
00:36:43,743 --> 00:36:48,205
That photo is a screen-shot
taken from my firm's security video.

739
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:49,831
We know what you look like.

740
00:36:49,957 --> 00:36:52,417
And if Mike Ross doesn't
hear from me in the next five minutes,

741
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:55,045
he's calling the police.

742
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:57,839
No, man. You're not coming
in here and threatening us.

743
00:36:57,965 --> 00:37:00,759
You're looking at kidnapping,
extortion, and drug dealing.

744
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:04,721
And the District Attorney happens
to be number three on my speed dial.

745
00:37:04,847 --> 00:37:08,558
Well, if we're looking at all that time,
you might as well add murder.

746
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:12,145
I've got a better idea.

747
00:37:12,271 --> 00:37:13,855
Retainer agreement.

748
00:37:13,981 --> 00:37:17,400
If you sign right here,
you'll become one of my clients.

749
00:37:17,526 --> 00:37:20,695
And I won't be able to testify
against you even if I wanted to.

750
00:37:20,821 --> 00:37:22,364
What about the money?

751
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:25,617
This envelope
contains $10,000.

752
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:27,786
Consider it a down payment
on Trevor's debt.

753
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:29,120
Only here's the thing.

754
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:30,664
I don't do pro bono work.

755
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:34,834
And my retainer agreement
requires a down payment of $10,000.

756
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:37,963
Now, as your attorney,
my job is to give you advice.

757
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:39,506
So, here's the deal.

758
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:44,344
Sign the agreement.

759
00:37:47,848 --> 00:37:49,933
I thought I said
not to come.

760
00:37:50,059 --> 00:37:52,686
Remember that forty bucks
from the fifth grade you owe me?

761
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:55,397
If you were dead,
how would I collect?

762
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:57,023
Oh, man.

763
00:37:57,149 --> 00:38:01,528
I'm sorry. I just put you in trouble
just by hanging out with you.

764
00:38:01,654 --> 00:38:03,405
So, why did you do it?

765
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:05,448
Because I'm a dick.

766
00:38:06,158 --> 00:38:07,659
I bet you didn't think
you'd have to save my ass

767
00:38:07,785 --> 00:38:09,369
so soon after bailing me out.

768
00:38:09,495 --> 00:38:11,246
I wasn't the one
who saved you.

769
00:38:11,372 --> 00:38:13,832
Yeah. Wow. As a friend,
that guy puts me to shame.

770
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:15,834
Harvey's not my friend.
Trust me.

771
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:19,045
Well, he didn't put his ass
on the line because of me.

772
00:38:19,171 --> 00:38:23,091
Listen, I pled you down to a
misdemeanor, drunk and disorderly,

773
00:38:23,217 --> 00:38:25,218
and I paid the fine.

774
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:29,931
I think it might be a good idea
if you got out of town for a while.

775
00:38:31,017 --> 00:38:31,975
Montana.

776
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:33,643
You said you wanted
a clean slate.

777
00:38:33,769 --> 00:38:35,520
I figured 20 hours on a bus
ought to do the trick.

778
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:37,605
Oh, yeah.
It will do me good.

779
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:40,066
Wait.

780
00:38:44,196 --> 00:38:46,448
When I get back, you know who
the first person I'm going to call is.

781
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:50,285
Yeah. The one person
you know who'll answer it.

782
00:39:09,055 --> 00:39:10,555
- For you.
- What's this?

783
00:39:10,681 --> 00:39:12,974
I'm very happy
you took Ray on pro bono.

784
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:15,935
You, on the other hand,
can afford our services.

785
00:39:16,062 --> 00:39:18,438
You want me to pay me
to represent me?

786
00:39:18,564 --> 00:39:20,732
Mmm-hmm.
Ten hours at a $1,000 an hour.

787
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:22,317
Yeah, I'll let you
do the math.

788
00:39:22,443 --> 00:39:23,568
You can't be serious.

789
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:25,320
I'll tell you
what I am serious about.

790
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:27,989
I hear you're finally
mentoring the kid.

791
00:39:28,115 --> 00:39:29,074
I don't know
what you're talking about.

792
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:32,077
Really? Because I understand that
you dropped the puppy analogy on him.

793
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:34,037
Which is exactly
what I used on you.

794
00:39:34,163 --> 00:39:35,872
It may have slipped out
by accident.

795
00:39:35,998 --> 00:39:37,582
On accident, on purpose...

796
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:41,378
The really important thing
is that I'm taller than you.

797
00:39:42,129 --> 00:39:42,962
Yeah.

798
00:39:54,266 --> 00:39:55,517
Yep.
You look much thinner in that.

799
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:57,936
You planted that story.
Be man enough to own it.

800
00:39:58,062 --> 00:39:59,813
I don't traffic in the tabloids,
Harvey.

801
00:39:59,939 --> 00:40:02,232
But I can see how whoever
planted this might find it amusing.

802
00:40:02,358 --> 00:40:05,902
The great Harvey Specter
bullying a humble cab driver?

803
00:40:06,028 --> 00:40:07,946
I mean,
it's a no-win situation, really.

804
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:09,364
Well, maybe you didn't hear.

805
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:11,324
I won the no-win situation.

806
00:40:12,326 --> 00:40:15,161
Did it ever occur to you
that if you hadn't done that to me,

807
00:40:15,287 --> 00:40:16,955
I actually
would have owed you one?

808
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:19,749
Maybe if you didn't humiliate me
in front of the associates.

809
00:40:19,875 --> 00:40:21,876
Louis,
for an average attorney,

810
00:40:22,002 --> 00:40:24,003
a $100 million
is a career case.

811
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:27,715
If I'm mocking you,
it means I think you're above average.

812
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:33,263
But stress balls?

813
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:34,931
You're making it too easy.

814
00:40:44,483 --> 00:40:47,026
You put Trevor
on the bus to the boondocks?

815
00:40:47,153 --> 00:40:49,279
Yeah.
Can I ask you a question?

816
00:40:49,864 --> 00:40:51,531
After all this,
you really think I'm still buying

817
00:40:51,657 --> 00:40:53,658
the Mr. I-Don't-Give-a-Crap thing?

818
00:40:55,244 --> 00:40:57,954
Joy sent a little token
of her appreciation.

819
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:00,373
She got your hair
just right.

820
00:41:03,252 --> 00:41:04,586
Did she ever
make one of these for you?

821
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:06,754
Not that you'll ever see.
