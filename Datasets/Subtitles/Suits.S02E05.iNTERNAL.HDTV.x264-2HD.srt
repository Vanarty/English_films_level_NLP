1
00:00:00,069 --> 00:00:01,436
Previously on <i>Suits:</i>

2
00:00:01,532 --> 00:00:03,432
We're suing you and your
entire firm for fraud.

3
00:00:03,953 --> 00:00:06,520
I'm looking at a document that
implicates you in a cover-up.

4
00:00:06,522 --> 00:00:09,257
I savaged his reputation all
because you looked me in the eye

5
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:11,492
and told me that your hood
was rock solid.

6
00:00:11,494 --> 00:00:13,995
You make it right
on your own or I will.

7
00:00:13,997 --> 00:00:16,163
When were you planning
on telling me this?

8
00:00:16,165 --> 00:00:17,999
Did you find what
you're not looking for?

9
00:00:18,001 --> 00:00:19,033
No, did u find
what you're not looking for?

10
00:00:19,035 --> 00:00:20,201
Nope.

11
00:00:20,203 --> 00:00:21,435
That document never
came into this office.

12
00:00:21,437 --> 00:00:22,637
Where the hell is Donna?

13
00:00:22,639 --> 00:00:24,038
She's in the file room.

14
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:25,239
Hasn't found that document yet.

15
00:00:25,241 --> 00:00:27,041
Anyone could have
seen it and missed it.

16
00:00:27,043 --> 00:00:28,776
I need to know
that didn't happen,

17
00:00:28,778 --> 00:00:32,013
or I need to know who to fire.

18
00:00:53,234 --> 00:00:54,468
Never thought I'd see

19
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:56,036
the great Harvey Specter
break a sweat.

20
00:00:56,038 --> 00:00:57,404
You want to race, Jeffrey?

21
00:00:57,406 --> 00:00:58,939
I'm more than happy
to kick your ass.

22
00:00:58,941 --> 00:01:00,474
Believe me, Harvey,

23
00:01:00,476 --> 00:01:02,209
I didn't get up
at 5:00 a.m. for my health.

24
00:01:02,211 --> 00:01:04,445
A guy like you
in Central Park at this hour?

25
00:01:04,447 --> 00:01:06,847
That's not where
my mind went either.

26
00:01:06,849 --> 00:01:09,483
Only guy I'm here
to solicit is you, buddy.

27
00:01:09,485 --> 00:01:11,518
I'll assume you've heard
of Marco Mendoza.

28
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,753
Yeah, the 16-year-old
tennis phenom.

29
00:01:12,755 --> 00:01:14,321
What about him?

30
00:01:14,323 --> 00:01:16,256
I'm on the cusp
of signing that kid.

31
00:01:16,258 --> 00:01:17,491
I want you
to be part of the team.

32
00:01:17,493 --> 00:01:18,892
Just because
I know about tennis

33
00:01:18,894 --> 00:01:20,360
doesn't mean I
give a shit about tennis.

34
00:01:20,362 --> 00:01:21,862
Hey, the basketballs
in your office

35
00:01:21,864 --> 00:01:23,197
didn't autograph
themselves, Harvey.

36
00:01:23,199 --> 00:01:25,299
You owe me. Oh, please.

37
00:01:25,301 --> 00:01:27,534
I've brought you just as
many clients as you brought me.

38
00:01:27,536 --> 00:01:30,237
Five minutes with the kid.
That's all I'm asking.

39
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:33,507
You're an agent, Jeffrey.
It's never all you're asking.

40
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:38,045
There might be
one slight wrinkle.

41
00:01:40,715 --> 00:01:43,083
So you want me to emancipate
him from his father?

42
00:01:43,085 --> 00:01:45,352
That's a hell of a thing to do
just for a commission.

43
00:01:45,354 --> 00:01:47,321
Just listen
to what he has to say.

44
00:01:47,323 --> 00:01:50,357
Marco, tell him your story.

45
00:01:50,359 --> 00:01:53,060
Look, I've been playing tennis
since before I could walk.

46
00:01:53,062 --> 00:01:55,229
When I was six, I was
crushing kids in high school.

47
00:01:55,231 --> 00:01:56,997
I don't play cards,
I don't drink.

48
00:01:56,999 --> 00:01:59,900
What I do is win.

49
00:01:59,902 --> 00:02:01,535
I like this kid.

50
00:02:01,537 --> 00:02:04,371
So what does that have
to do with your father?

51
00:02:04,373 --> 00:02:06,874
He won't let me go pro.

52
00:02:06,876 --> 00:02:08,242
So it's all about the money.

53
00:02:08,244 --> 00:02:09,176
No, I don't care
about the money.

54
00:02:09,178 --> 00:02:10,611
You can keep the money.

55
00:02:10,613 --> 00:02:13,514
Nine out of ten tournaments
are closed to amateurs.

56
00:02:13,516 --> 00:02:16,083
If I don't go pro,
I can't play against the best.

57
00:02:16,085 --> 00:02:17,451
And if I can't
play against the best,

58
00:02:17,453 --> 00:02:18,919
I can't be the best.

59
00:02:18,921 --> 00:02:21,755
That's a great speech,
but you're 16,

60
00:02:21,757 --> 00:02:24,992
and what I'm not hearing is why
you can't wait two more years.

61
00:02:24,994 --> 00:02:27,261
People hit their prime
at different ages, Mr. Specter.

62
00:02:27,263 --> 00:02:29,463
Look at me.

63
00:02:29,465 --> 00:02:33,467
I have a chance to be great,
and I have a chance now.

64
00:02:51,386 --> 00:02:52,719
You know that paper doesn't...

65
00:02:52,721 --> 00:02:54,454
put itself
in the machine, right?

66
00:02:54,456 --> 00:02:56,056
What the hell
is wrong with you?

67
00:02:56,058 --> 00:02:57,291
Me? You're the one that looks

68
00:02:57,293 --> 00:02:58,492
like you're
burying a dead body.

69
00:02:58,494 --> 00:03:00,994
It is 6:00 in the morning.

70
00:03:00,996 --> 00:03:02,663
I come in here
to shred in peace,

71
00:03:02,665 --> 00:03:04,698
and you walk in and you scare
the crap out of me.

72
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:07,067
I'm sorry... "Shred in peace"?

73
00:03:07,069 --> 00:03:10,070
Do you have any idea
how dangerous this machine is?

74
00:03:10,072 --> 00:03:11,705
Okay, I'm sorry.

75
00:03:11,707 --> 00:03:13,440
If you want, I can help.

76
00:03:13,442 --> 00:03:14,875
I'm actually here
to do some shredding myself.

77
00:03:14,877 --> 00:03:16,610
You know what? Never mind.

78
00:03:16,612 --> 00:03:19,746
You've ruined the whole thing.

79
00:03:19,748 --> 00:03:21,081
Well, the good news is,

80
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:22,716
we don't have
a copy of that memo.

81
00:03:22,718 --> 00:03:23,951
I'm sorry
to rain on your parade,

82
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:25,919
but the accusation here
isn't that you have it,

83
00:03:25,921 --> 00:03:27,688
it's that you buried it,

84
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:28,989
so we should
probably move forward.

85
00:03:28,991 --> 00:03:30,290
To what?

86
00:03:30,292 --> 00:03:31,458
We need to put them
on the defensive.

87
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:34,194
- No, we don't.
- Harvey.

88
00:03:34,196 --> 00:03:35,529
We need to get them
to drop the case.

89
00:03:35,531 --> 00:03:37,764
- And how would we do that?
- How would I do it?

90
00:03:37,766 --> 00:03:39,466
I would go to
the Randall family.

91
00:03:39,468 --> 00:03:41,001
They got screwed
and they want justice,

92
00:03:41,003 --> 00:03:42,469
but I'm not the guy
who screwed them,

93
00:03:42,471 --> 00:03:43,503
so we need to
convince them that I...

94
00:03:43,505 --> 00:03:45,105
Are you crazy?

95
00:03:45,107 --> 00:03:47,207
You trashed this woman's
dead husband in open court.

96
00:03:47,209 --> 00:03:48,642
Do you think she gives a shit

97
00:03:48,644 --> 00:03:50,010
about whether or not
you buried that document?

98
00:03:50,012 --> 00:03:52,245
If you go there, you're not
just poking the bear,

99
00:03:52,247 --> 00:03:54,181
you're putting
a cattle prod up its ass.

100
00:03:54,183 --> 00:03:55,682
Is that the same crack advice

101
00:03:55,684 --> 00:03:57,985
you gave Brockton Cosmetics
and Drake Consulting

102
00:03:57,987 --> 00:03:59,286
and Nappi LLC.?

103
00:03:59,288 --> 00:04:00,887
'Cause none of those companies
exist anymore.

104
00:04:00,889 --> 00:04:02,556
Congratulations, Harvey.

105
00:04:02,558 --> 00:04:05,092
You found the three cases
that I've lost in 14 years.

106
00:04:05,094 --> 00:04:07,027
And do you know what else
those cases have in common?

107
00:04:07,029 --> 00:04:10,430
Nothing. Because I learn
from my mistakes.

108
00:04:10,432 --> 00:04:11,798
Well, I'd prefer
to be represented by someone

109
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,467
who doesn't make any mistakes
in the first place.

110
00:04:13,469 --> 00:04:15,202
Like you?

111
00:04:15,204 --> 00:04:16,937
Because you've been accused
of burying evidence

112
00:04:16,939 --> 00:04:18,605
not once, but twice.

113
00:04:18,607 --> 00:04:20,507
Those accusations are bullshit.

114
00:04:20,509 --> 00:04:22,042
And that is
what I'm here to prove.

115
00:04:22,044 --> 00:04:25,579
Jessica, if I may?

116
00:04:25,581 --> 00:04:28,215
I don't think Harvey's problem
is with Allison.

117
00:04:28,217 --> 00:04:30,817
I think his problem is with me.

118
00:04:30,819 --> 00:04:32,753
Daniel, we don't need
to air our laundry in here.

119
00:04:32,755 --> 00:04:35,155
This is
a privileged conversation.

120
00:04:35,157 --> 00:04:38,158
Jessica, I'm asking
you and Harvey to trust me.

121
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,894
So I'm going to
do the same for you.

122
00:04:40,896 --> 00:04:45,165
I brought Allison in here
because I think she's the best.

123
00:04:45,167 --> 00:04:47,034
Use her or don't.

124
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:51,104
But, if not, I suggest
you find someone just as good.

125
00:04:51,106 --> 00:04:53,507
Harvey...

126
00:04:53,509 --> 00:04:58,045
will you give
Allison and me a minute?

127
00:04:58,047 --> 00:05:01,081
Let her down easy.

128
00:05:03,284 --> 00:05:06,753
Allison, I am impressed by you.

129
00:05:06,755 --> 00:05:08,021
But if I'm going
to give you this job,

130
00:05:08,023 --> 00:05:10,023
I need to know
that I can trust you.

131
00:05:10,025 --> 00:05:11,725
I'm a straight shooter,
Jessica.

132
00:05:11,727 --> 00:05:14,728
Easy to say, harder to prove.

133
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:16,296
All right, how about this?

134
00:05:16,298 --> 00:05:19,232
Um, you are an elegant woman,

135
00:05:19,234 --> 00:05:20,767
but there's no
getting around it...

136
00:05:20,769 --> 00:05:24,838
that dress does not
belong in this office.

137
00:05:27,443 --> 00:05:28,709
I like you.

138
00:05:28,711 --> 00:05:30,711
This may be something
that you don't like.

139
00:05:30,713 --> 00:05:33,647
You won't be the one
dictating terms here. I will.

140
00:05:33,649 --> 00:05:35,148
And regarding your laundry,

141
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:36,917
you have my word that Danny
won't be involved,

142
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:39,519
but you need to keep
that man on a leash.

143
00:05:39,521 --> 00:05:40,921
- She said that to your face?
- Yep.

144
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:42,856
- You kick her ass out?
- Hired her on the spot.

145
00:05:42,858 --> 00:05:43,957
The woman insults you,

146
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:45,926
all of a sudden
you're in bed with her?

147
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:47,661
Maybe I should tell you
how much I hate those shoes.

148
00:05:47,663 --> 00:05:48,762
That's the joke
you're gonna make?

149
00:05:48,764 --> 00:05:50,163
What? It's both respectful

150
00:05:50,165 --> 00:05:51,965
and disrespectful
at the same time.

151
00:05:51,967 --> 00:05:53,734
Harvey, I don't
want you to overlook

152
00:05:53,736 --> 00:05:56,470
the point of the story.
It's Allison's case.

153
00:05:56,472 --> 00:05:57,771
The firm is the client,
and you're...

154
00:05:57,773 --> 00:06:02,209
- The dog on a leash?
- Stay out of her way.

155
00:06:07,148 --> 00:06:08,415
I got the address.

156
00:06:08,417 --> 00:06:09,716
Then I guess it's time

157
00:06:09,718 --> 00:06:12,652

to go chase some cars.

I am not seeing
what I'm seeing.

169
00:06:58,966 --> 00:07:00,532
Mrs. Randall, please,

170
00:07:00,534 --> 00:07:02,601
I know you hate me for
what I did to your husband.

171
00:07:02,603 --> 00:07:03,869
"Hate" is not the word.

172
00:07:03,871 --> 00:07:06,305
There is no word to describe
what I feel for you.

173
00:07:06,307 --> 00:07:08,941
Now get your ass...
Jennifer, look where we are.

174
00:07:08,943 --> 00:07:10,742
I don't mean to disrespect you

175
00:07:10,744 --> 00:07:12,544
or dishonor
your husband's memory.

176
00:07:12,546 --> 00:07:14,012
You've already done that.

177
00:07:14,014 --> 00:07:15,447
I'm trying to make up
for it now.

178
00:07:15,449 --> 00:07:17,182
Now that your back's
against the wall.

179
00:07:17,184 --> 00:07:19,685
No, I started years ago.

180
00:07:22,555 --> 00:07:24,856
This says
he's our anonymous donor.

181
00:07:24,858 --> 00:07:26,625
- It's true.
- Of course. Guilty conscience.

182
00:07:26,627 --> 00:07:29,061
No, I don't have
a guilty conscience,

183
00:07:29,063 --> 00:07:30,896
'cause I wasn't the one
who hid that memo.

184
00:07:30,898 --> 00:07:32,264
Look, I went after your husband

185
00:07:32,266 --> 00:07:33,999
because I thought
that car was solid.

186
00:07:34,001 --> 00:07:36,335
I didn't like doing it,
but it was my job.

187
00:07:36,337 --> 00:07:37,903
Why'd you give us
the money then?

188
00:07:37,905 --> 00:07:39,638
Because you were trying
to make something good

189
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,974
come from something bad,
like I am now.

190
00:07:41,976 --> 00:07:44,176
- What do you want?
- I know what he wants.

191
00:07:44,178 --> 00:07:46,612
We're not dropping our suit.

192
00:07:46,614 --> 00:07:48,547
And the fact that you would
come here to tell me that

193
00:07:48,549 --> 00:07:51,216
shows me just what kind
of self-serving trash you are.

194
00:07:51,218 --> 00:07:54,019
You're right, I came here
to get you to drop your suit.

195
00:07:54,021 --> 00:07:57,322
But instead of self-serving,
let's talk about me serving you.

196
00:07:57,324 --> 00:07:59,391
You want payback
for what was done to you...

197
00:07:59,393 --> 00:08:01,360
justice... and I can get it.

198
00:08:01,362 --> 00:08:03,328
My husband died,

199
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:05,697
and you made me sit there
while you shit on him.

200
00:08:05,699 --> 00:08:07,499
That's what was done to me.

201
00:08:07,501 --> 00:08:10,569
Now you're gonna tell me
that wasn't you?

202
00:08:10,571 --> 00:08:12,404
Yeah, I want justice,

203
00:08:12,406 --> 00:08:16,008
but that little donation
doesn't cover it.

204
00:08:34,428 --> 00:08:36,495
This isn't really helping
your street cred, Harold.

205
00:08:36,497 --> 00:08:38,330
It's not mine, it's Louis'.

206
00:08:38,332 --> 00:08:40,165
What's his name?

207
00:08:40,167 --> 00:08:42,367
Bruno. He brought him in

208
00:08:42,369 --> 00:08:43,669
because he hasn't been eating.

209
00:08:43,671 --> 00:08:46,171
Whoa, wh... have you
mentioned to Louis

210
00:08:46,173 --> 00:08:48,173
that you're allergic?

211
00:08:48,175 --> 00:08:50,242
I tried to, but he said that...

212
00:08:50,244 --> 00:08:52,110
Allergies
are a sign of weakness.

213
00:08:52,112 --> 00:08:54,646
Right, and bringing your cat
to work is a sign of strength.

214
00:08:54,648 --> 00:08:57,683
Yeah, you want to trade places?

215
00:08:57,685 --> 00:08:59,751
Uh, nope.

216
00:08:59,753 --> 00:09:01,286
No, I got a meeting
in the conference room.

217
00:09:01,288 --> 00:09:02,587
That's right,
that little tennis fling.

218
00:09:02,589 --> 00:09:03,855
Makes me sick.

219
00:09:03,857 --> 00:09:05,724
Harvey's got no appreciation
for the game.

220
00:09:05,726 --> 00:09:07,526
Man wouldn't know topspin
if it hit him in the ball sack.

221
00:09:07,528 --> 00:09:10,629
But enjoy yourself. Get out.

222
00:09:15,768 --> 00:09:18,070
Can you not smell that?
I'm stuffed up.

223
00:09:18,072 --> 00:09:19,237
Uhhuh. How long has it been?

224
00:09:19,239 --> 00:09:20,238
Two hours.

225
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,406
How often do
I tell you to do it?

226
00:09:21,408 --> 00:09:24,976
I'll get the bag.

227
00:09:24,978 --> 00:09:25,977
Hi.

228
00:09:25,979 --> 00:09:28,113
What's wrong, Bruno?

229
00:09:28,115 --> 00:09:29,281
You're my best friend.

230
00:09:29,283 --> 00:09:32,551
- You all set?
- I'm ready to roll.

231
00:09:32,553 --> 00:09:34,019
Good, 'cause I got
a bidding war starting

232
00:09:34,021 --> 00:09:36,555
for Marco's endorsement.

233
00:09:36,557 --> 00:09:37,856
Dad?

234
00:09:37,858 --> 00:09:39,257
Marco, why don't
you take a seat?

235
00:09:39,259 --> 00:09:40,359
What's he doing here?

236
00:09:40,361 --> 00:09:41,793
He's here to meet with his son.

237
00:09:41,795 --> 00:09:44,162
We're emancipating,
and you said you were in.

238
00:09:44,164 --> 00:09:46,231
I did, which means
Marco's my client,

239
00:09:46,233 --> 00:09:49,134
not you, so why don't you
go home, Jeffrey?

240
00:09:49,136 --> 00:09:51,303
I'll call you when we're done.

241
00:09:55,475 --> 00:09:58,110
Mr. Mendoza,
I want to be clear,

242
00:09:58,112 --> 00:09:59,311
I'm not here
to exploit your son.

243
00:09:59,313 --> 00:10:00,512
I'm here to protect him.

244
00:10:00,514 --> 00:10:01,513
You're off to a good start.

245
00:10:01,515 --> 00:10:03,115
You can ask
any one of my clients.

246
00:10:03,117 --> 00:10:04,149
They'll tell you the same.

247
00:10:04,151 --> 00:10:06,818
You represent Michael Jordan.

248
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:09,421
I do. In fact, I want
to tell you a story about him.

249
00:10:09,423 --> 00:10:11,857
You want to tell me
a story about Michael Jordan

250
00:10:11,859 --> 00:10:13,358
to convince me
my son should turn pro?

251
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,327
Let me tell you a story
about George Washington.

252
00:10:15,329 --> 00:10:16,828
Maybe junior here
could become President.

253
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:19,097
I'm really more of
an Abe Lincoln fan myself.

254
00:10:19,099 --> 00:10:20,766
You know, freed the slaves,
great beard.

255
00:10:20,768 --> 00:10:22,401
- You finished?
- Yep.

256
00:10:22,403 --> 00:10:26,405
Everybody knows M.J.
took two years off in his prime.

257
00:10:26,407 --> 00:10:28,206
He regrets it to this day.

258
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:29,374
But he made
that decision himself,

259
00:10:29,376 --> 00:10:31,109
and that's how
he lives with it.

260
00:10:31,111 --> 00:10:34,679
All your son is asking is
for the chance to do the same.

261
00:10:34,681 --> 00:10:35,781
I may not know Mr. Jordan,

262
00:10:35,783 --> 00:10:37,549
but I do know
that he's divorced,

263
00:10:37,551 --> 00:10:40,218
and I've heard the rumors
about his gambling problem.

264
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:41,887
He's a man apart.

265
00:10:41,889 --> 00:10:45,290
Now, my son is not ready
to handle that kind of life.

266
00:10:45,292 --> 00:10:47,626
You've prepared me for this
since I was three.

267
00:10:47,628 --> 00:10:49,928
I taught you tennis
because it's a beautiful game.

268
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:52,197
You may not have set out
to raise a prodigy,

269
00:10:52,199 --> 00:10:53,598
but the fact is, you did.

270
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,034
Do you have any children,
Mr. Specter?

271
00:10:56,036 --> 00:10:59,004
No? Then I'm not interested
in your parenting advice.

272
00:10:59,006 --> 00:11:00,439
I'm not giving
parenting advice.

273
00:11:00,441 --> 00:11:01,740
I'm giving career advice.

274
00:11:01,742 --> 00:11:03,942
You told me that
you didn't want to exploit him,

275
00:11:03,944 --> 00:11:05,644
that you wanted
to protect him...

276
00:11:05,646 --> 00:11:08,079
him, not his career.
Look, you don't get it.

277
00:11:08,081 --> 00:11:09,481
They're the same to me.

278
00:11:09,483 --> 00:11:10,582
All right, I'm committed
to both of them,

279
00:11:10,584 --> 00:11:11,383
and I don't give a shit
if you like it or not.

280
00:11:11,385 --> 00:11:12,951
Marco.

281
00:11:12,953 --> 00:11:14,152
You say that word to me
in front of these parasites?

282
00:11:14,154 --> 00:11:15,587
Yeah, I'll say
whatever I want to say.

283
00:11:15,589 --> 00:11:17,489
Shut your mouth.

284
00:11:17,491 --> 00:11:19,224
Now, you are not
going to turn pro,

285
00:11:19,226 --> 00:11:21,460
and you are not going
to continue down this path,

286
00:11:21,462 --> 00:11:25,897
and this conversation is over.

287
00:11:25,899 --> 00:11:27,466
You just want to let him leave?

288
00:11:27,468 --> 00:11:29,034
Look, I don't
care what he does, okay?

289
00:11:29,036 --> 00:11:32,037
I want to file
for emancipation.

290
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,841
So you're telling me
you don't have it?

291
00:11:35,843 --> 00:11:37,642
I don't, but I'm sure
it'll turn up.

292
00:11:37,644 --> 00:11:38,944
You sure?

293
00:11:38,946 --> 00:11:40,579
Your job was to keep track
of that one thing.

294
00:11:40,581 --> 00:11:41,746
Nice work.

295
00:11:41,748 --> 00:11:43,482
It's a birthday card for Norma.

296
00:11:43,484 --> 00:11:44,616
She won't even tell us
how old she is.

297
00:11:44,618 --> 00:11:45,984
Her birthday is today.

298
00:11:45,986 --> 00:11:48,487
When do you think
it's going to turn up?

299
00:11:48,489 --> 00:11:49,488
You know what, forget it.

300
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:51,356
What's the matter with you?

301
00:11:51,358 --> 00:11:53,358
What's the matter with me
is that nobody ever has

302
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,560
what they're supposed to
in this goddamn office.

303
00:11:59,131 --> 00:12:01,533
You know what?
I got bigger fish to fry.

304
00:12:01,535 --> 00:12:03,335
Put the wheels in motion.
"The wheels"?

305
00:12:03,337 --> 00:12:04,469
This isn't a merger, Harvey.

306
00:12:04,471 --> 00:12:06,104
You're talking
about emancipation.

307
00:12:06,106 --> 00:12:08,340
I'm talking about
filing for emancipation.

308
00:12:08,342 --> 00:12:11,009
It's a tactic.
He cares about his son.

309
00:12:11,011 --> 00:12:12,210
Nine times out of ten,
he backs down.

310
00:12:12,212 --> 00:12:13,712
And what if he doesn't?

311
00:12:13,714 --> 00:12:16,281
Then we'll be doing exactly
what the client wants us to do.

312
00:12:16,283 --> 00:12:17,649
Oh, you mean
break up his family.

313
00:12:17,651 --> 00:12:18,984
I mean help his family.

314
00:12:18,986 --> 00:12:20,285
Wow, wonder
what kind of relationship

315
00:12:20,287 --> 00:12:21,586
you had with your father.

316
00:12:21,588 --> 00:12:23,255
Look, my father's
not up for discussion.

317
00:12:23,257 --> 00:12:26,024
The only bone of contention
between them is this decision.

318
00:12:26,026 --> 00:12:28,093
The sooner they resolve it,
the sooner they can move on.

319
00:12:28,095 --> 00:12:29,294
The sooner you get paid.

320
00:12:29,296 --> 00:12:30,996
I cut billion dollar deals
for breakfast.

321
00:12:30,998 --> 00:12:33,398
I don't need this. I told you,

322
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,734
it's what the client wants.

323
00:12:35,736 --> 00:12:37,369
It's what he <i>thinks</i> he wants.

324
00:12:37,371 --> 00:12:40,372
Harvey, I was 11
when my dad died,

325
00:12:40,374 --> 00:12:42,841
and our last conversation
was a fight.

326
00:12:42,843 --> 00:12:44,910
If you gave me the choice
to be a pro anything

327
00:12:44,912 --> 00:12:47,512
or to make up with him,
what do you think I'd choose?

328
00:12:47,514 --> 00:12:49,848
If we don't do it, he'll find
someone else who will.

329
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:53,318
If you don't want him to do it,
change his goddamn mind.

330
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:56,655
Now go. Fine.

331
00:13:05,031 --> 00:13:06,431
Here's your
goddamn birthday card.

332
00:13:06,433 --> 00:13:08,967
I don't appreciate you
coming into my office saying

333
00:13:08,969 --> 00:13:11,436
that no one at the firm has
what they're supposed to have,

334
00:13:11,438 --> 00:13:12,804
and I don't know what
crawled up your ass today,

335
00:13:12,806 --> 00:13:14,372
but I take care of my business.

336
00:13:14,374 --> 00:13:18,076
I'm sorry, Rach. You're right.

337
00:13:18,078 --> 00:13:20,211
This isn't about you.
This is about me.

338
00:13:20,213 --> 00:13:22,647
Okay then.

339
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:50,542
I unplugged it.

340
00:13:52,211 --> 00:13:54,813
And this time, I'm not
stopping you by accident.

341
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:56,314
I have no idea
what you're talking about...

342
00:13:56,316 --> 00:13:58,083
Don't bullshit me, Donna.

343
00:13:58,085 --> 00:14:00,852
That's the same file you had
in your hand this morning.

344
00:14:00,854 --> 00:14:04,055
You ran out of here
like you saw a ghost,

345
00:14:04,057 --> 00:14:06,458
you bit off Rachel's head,
talking about how people

346
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:07,659
never have the things
they're supposed to have,

347
00:14:07,661 --> 00:14:10,395
and now you're
right back here again.

348
00:14:10,397 --> 00:14:12,597
It's not Dalton Enterprises
you're holding.

349
00:14:12,599 --> 00:14:14,799
That's the memo that Harvey's
been accused of burying.

350
00:14:14,801 --> 00:14:17,569
You know, the fact that
you would even accuse me of that

351
00:14:17,571 --> 00:14:20,205
makes me sick.

352
00:14:20,207 --> 00:14:21,539
But if you still
don't believe me, fine.

353
00:14:21,541 --> 00:14:24,309
See for yourself.

354
00:14:28,981 --> 00:14:30,515
I don't know what to do.

355
00:14:30,517 --> 00:14:32,484
Tell me what happened.

356
00:14:32,486 --> 00:14:33,852
I found it in
the file room that day.

357
00:14:33,854 --> 00:14:35,787
It has my date stamp
on it... mine.

358
00:14:35,789 --> 00:14:37,489
We have to tell Harvey.

359
00:14:37,491 --> 00:14:39,190
He'll know what to do.
No, he won't.

360
00:14:39,192 --> 00:14:40,525
Donna, Harvey's been
operating under the assumption

361
00:14:40,527 --> 00:14:41,860
that we never had
this memo, all right?

362
00:14:41,862 --> 00:14:43,228
At some point, that assumption

363
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:44,596
is gonna bite him in the ass,

364
00:14:44,598 --> 00:14:45,997
and the later it happens,
the bigger the bite.

365
00:14:45,999 --> 00:14:47,132
Nobody is going to believe

366
00:14:47,134 --> 00:14:48,767
that a file that important
just got lost.

367
00:14:48,769 --> 00:14:50,435
They'll think that
I got rid of it,

368
00:14:50,437 --> 00:14:51,803
and that Harvey
told me to do it.

369
00:14:51,805 --> 00:14:53,605
This memo is part
of a legal proceeding.

370
00:14:53,607 --> 00:14:55,340
Shredding it is a crime.

371
00:14:55,342 --> 00:14:58,209
Like practicing law
without a license is a crime?

372
00:15:00,146 --> 00:15:02,380
Unlike you,
I didn't do this on purpose,

373
00:15:02,382 --> 00:15:04,949
and I am protecting Harvey
the best way that I know how.

374
00:15:04,951 --> 00:15:06,685
Allison Holt is gonna
figure out what happened.

375
00:15:06,687 --> 00:15:08,253
And when she does,
her priority's not going to be

376
00:15:08,255 --> 00:15:09,821
protecting you or Harvey.

377
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:13,024
It's gonna be
protecting the firm.

378
00:15:13,026 --> 00:15:14,859
You might be comfortable
putting Harvey in that position,

379
00:15:14,861 --> 00:15:16,728
but I'm not.

380
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:19,831
So either you tell him,
or I will.

381
00:15:49,849 --> 00:15:52,084
- The answer is yes.
- What?

382
00:15:52,086 --> 00:15:54,988
You can have
Halloween off this year.

383
00:15:54,989 --> 00:15:57,923
Every July, you sit there
staring at me

384
00:15:57,925 --> 00:16:00,759
before coming in here with
that sheepish look on your face

385
00:16:00,761 --> 00:16:02,328
to ask to...
I have to tell you something.

386
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:03,395
What? What is it?

387
00:16:03,397 --> 00:16:05,531
What the hell
were you thinking?

388
00:16:05,533 --> 00:16:07,032
You contacted the plaintiffs

389
00:16:07,034 --> 00:16:08,734
without their lawyer present
or our lawyer present.

390
00:16:08,736 --> 00:16:10,836
Exactly, I'm not our lawyer.

391
00:16:10,838 --> 00:16:12,137
I had every legal right to.

392
00:16:12,139 --> 00:16:13,839
You weren't supposed
to interfere.

393
00:16:13,841 --> 00:16:16,642
Neither were you.
How did you even know?

394
00:16:16,644 --> 00:16:17,943
She's not supposed
to tell you anything.

395
00:16:17,945 --> 00:16:19,979
She was forced to tell me

396
00:16:19,981 --> 00:16:21,947
when I got served
with this goddamn subpoena.

397
00:16:21,949 --> 00:16:23,349
You didn't want
to put them on the defensive,

398
00:16:23,351 --> 00:16:25,084
which is good,
because what you've just done

399
00:16:25,086 --> 00:16:26,318
is put us on the defensive,

400
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,720
so now I have to spend
the next two weeks

401
00:16:27,722 --> 00:16:30,322
prepping everyone from
Jessica to your secretary,

402
00:16:30,324 --> 00:16:32,925
because Travis Tanner is gonna
depose them under oath.

403
00:16:32,927 --> 00:16:34,927
Nobody here knows
a thing about that goddamn memo.

404
00:16:34,929 --> 00:16:36,261
Let them waste
their time with it.

405
00:16:36,263 --> 00:16:38,998
This is why you hire
outside counsel.

406
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,265
You can't see
how reckless that was,

407
00:16:40,267 --> 00:16:42,167
even now, after
it's blown up in your face.

408
00:16:42,169 --> 00:16:45,304
Fine, if you insist on
pre-deposing their depositions,

409
00:16:45,306 --> 00:16:47,573
let's get it over with.
You can start with me.

410
00:16:47,575 --> 00:16:50,042
I already have
your version of events.

411
00:16:50,044 --> 00:16:52,911
Okay, you can start with Donna.

412
00:16:55,315 --> 00:16:56,582
What's not to understand?

413
00:16:56,584 --> 00:16:58,617
Most fathers in the same
situation would either

414
00:16:58,619 --> 00:17:00,919
want to live vicariously
through their children's lives

415
00:17:00,921 --> 00:17:02,254
or sponge off their backs,

416
00:17:02,256 --> 00:17:04,456
but your father,
he's just trying to protect you.

417
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:06,125
Yeah, look, I know
what he thinks he's doing.

418
00:17:06,127 --> 00:17:08,927
Marco, it's a year
and eight months.

419
00:17:08,929 --> 00:17:10,763
Maybe, but you don't
know what it's like

420
00:17:10,765 --> 00:17:12,498
to be better at something
than everyone.

421
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:16,268
A year and eight months
is 505 days.

422
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:21,140
12,120 hours
and 727,200 minutes.

423
00:17:21,142 --> 00:17:23,008
Yeah, I know what it's like.

424
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:25,177
You can do math
when you're an old man.

425
00:17:25,179 --> 00:17:26,712
I can only dominate
till I'm 30.

426
00:17:26,714 --> 00:17:28,480
Maybe, but if you go through
with this now,

427
00:17:28,482 --> 00:17:30,182
you're gonna drive a wedge
between the two of you

428
00:17:30,184 --> 00:17:31,684
that'll last
the rest of your life.

429
00:17:31,686 --> 00:17:33,185
It's already there
because of him.

430
00:17:33,187 --> 00:17:34,753
I'm like the horse
in the stall.

431
00:17:34,755 --> 00:17:36,689
He won't open the gate, and
if it stays shut much longer,

432
00:17:36,691 --> 00:17:39,892
I'm gonna go crazy.
All right, you're the client.

433
00:17:39,894 --> 00:17:41,160
I just have a couple
of questions for you

434
00:17:41,162 --> 00:17:42,628
before we can file
with the courts, okay?

435
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:44,063
Okay, great.

436
00:17:44,065 --> 00:17:45,364
Has your father ever
abused drugs or alcohol?

437
00:17:45,366 --> 00:17:47,099
- No.
- Is he a gambling addict?

438
00:17:47,101 --> 00:17:48,467
- No, nothing like that.
- Is your home without

439
00:17:48,469 --> 00:17:50,536
electricity,
running water, food?

440
00:17:50,538 --> 00:17:51,603
We don't live in a slum.

441
00:17:51,605 --> 00:17:52,871
Emancipation requires proof

442
00:17:52,873 --> 00:17:54,840
that your father
is an unfit parent.

443
00:17:54,842 --> 00:17:57,042
We have to think about
how this plays in court.

444
00:17:57,044 --> 00:17:58,644
And telling a judge
that he just wants you

445
00:17:58,646 --> 00:18:00,713
to wait until you finish
high school before you make

446
00:18:00,715 --> 00:18:04,516
millions of dollars
is not going to cut it.

447
00:18:04,518 --> 00:18:07,686
Look, Marco...

448
00:18:07,688 --> 00:18:08,887
what I saw in
that conference room

449
00:18:08,889 --> 00:18:12,624
is not a father who was unfit.

450
00:18:12,626 --> 00:18:14,993
I saw a father
who loves his son.

451
00:18:18,965 --> 00:18:21,900
You saw something else
in there, too.

452
00:18:21,902 --> 00:18:26,472
You saw how furious he gets
when he's defied.

453
00:18:26,474 --> 00:18:28,807
What are you getting at?

454
00:18:28,809 --> 00:18:30,876
I'm getting at what happens
when he feels that way

455
00:18:30,878 --> 00:18:35,280
and nobody else is around.

456
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,484
There's no reason
to be concerned.

457
00:18:38,486 --> 00:18:40,419
These are pro forma questions
I'm asking everyone.

458
00:18:40,421 --> 00:18:41,820
Oh, I'm not concerned,
I'm bored,

459
00:18:41,822 --> 00:18:43,388
so can we just...

460
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:45,057
Of course.

461
00:18:45,059 --> 00:18:47,326
Do you think you can move
that other there?

462
00:18:47,328 --> 00:18:48,727
It's my good side.

463
00:18:48,729 --> 00:18:51,797
Well, my better side.
They're both good.

464
00:18:51,799 --> 00:18:55,033
I'm just going to start. Um...

465
00:18:55,035 --> 00:18:57,569
So, when documents
are received into the firm,

466
00:18:57,571 --> 00:18:58,670
they then come to you.

467
00:18:58,672 --> 00:19:00,139
Is that correct? Yes.

468
00:19:00,141 --> 00:19:02,307
And how do they get
from the mail room to you?

469
00:19:02,309 --> 00:19:05,577
Transporter beam.

470
00:19:07,347 --> 00:19:10,382
Ms. Paulsen, I understand
that your time is valuable,

471
00:19:10,384 --> 00:19:12,451
but I'm here to prepare you.

472
00:19:12,453 --> 00:19:16,054
And to a jury,
sarcasm plays as obstructive.

473
00:19:16,056 --> 00:19:20,726
Obviously, any further mention
of <i>Star Trek</i>

474
00:19:20,728 --> 00:19:23,228
may just compound
the problem, okay?

475
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:26,365
Aye, cap'n.

476
00:19:26,367 --> 00:19:28,634
It's Donna, right?

477
00:19:28,636 --> 00:19:31,103
All right,
so where you from, Donna?

478
00:19:31,105 --> 00:19:33,639
- Upstate.
- Like Utica?

479
00:19:33,641 --> 00:19:35,607
No, Cortland, actually.

480
00:19:35,609 --> 00:19:37,709
Cortland's kind of
in the middle, isn't it?

481
00:19:37,711 --> 00:19:39,144
I'm sorry, what does this
have to do with...

482
00:19:39,146 --> 00:19:40,412
I'm just trying
to get to know you,

483
00:19:40,414 --> 00:19:41,647
break down the walls.

484
00:19:41,649 --> 00:19:42,981
You may not know this about me,

485
00:19:42,983 --> 00:19:44,716
but the truth is,
I'm actually single.

486
00:19:44,718 --> 00:19:47,920
- Divorced?
- As a matter of fact, yes.

487
00:19:47,922 --> 00:19:50,722
But anyway, I've been
going on all these dates,

488
00:19:50,724 --> 00:19:52,691
and I found that
sometimes the best way

489
00:19:52,693 --> 00:19:53,992
to get the conversation going

490
00:19:53,994 --> 00:19:55,627
is just start asking
a bunch of questions.

491
00:19:55,629 --> 00:19:58,330
For example, where do you
see yourself in five years?

492
00:19:58,332 --> 00:20:00,499
Well, actually, that's...

493
00:20:00,501 --> 00:20:02,835
'Cause where I see you
is in jail.

494
00:20:02,837 --> 00:20:04,503
Do you think
I was born yesterday?

495
00:20:04,505 --> 00:20:06,104
You know what Harvey did
with that memo,

496
00:20:06,106 --> 00:20:07,406
and you're going
to tell me right now.

497
00:20:07,408 --> 00:20:11,009
Harvey didn't do anything.

498
00:20:11,011 --> 00:20:13,579
Oh, I see.

499
00:20:13,581 --> 00:20:17,382
He didn't have to
because you did it for him.

500
00:20:17,384 --> 00:20:19,651
That's not true.

501
00:20:19,653 --> 00:20:21,420
Then tell me what is true.

502
00:20:21,422 --> 00:20:24,256
Well, that's easy.

503
00:20:24,258 --> 00:20:26,425
You don't give a shit
about me or Harvey.

504
00:20:26,427 --> 00:20:28,260
This is a witch hunt,

505
00:20:28,262 --> 00:20:32,030
and I'm not gonna sit in
this room for another minute.

506
00:20:34,607 --> 00:20:35,707
I've worked with Harvey since

507
00:20:35,709 --> 00:20:37,368
he was a rookie
in the mail room.

508
00:20:37,413 --> 00:20:38,812
No way he buried that memo.

509
00:20:38,814 --> 00:20:40,814
You didn't see Donna
in that room.

510
00:20:40,816 --> 00:20:43,383
I'm not saying
she wouldn't do it if he asked.

511
00:20:43,385 --> 00:20:44,918
I'm saying he wouldn't ask.

512
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,453
Wouldn't he?

513
00:20:46,455 --> 00:20:48,221
Because she's not
the only person I talked to.

514
00:20:48,414 --> 00:20:50,248
Now, a lot of people,
they don't like Harvey.

515
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:51,949
But even the ones that love him

516
00:20:51,951 --> 00:20:55,653
say he likes to work
in the gray.

517
00:20:55,655 --> 00:20:57,255
I'd like Harvey
to sign this affidavit

518
00:20:57,257 --> 00:20:58,956
swearing that his office
never received the memo.

519
00:20:58,958 --> 00:20:59,957
Why?

520
00:20:59,959 --> 00:21:01,492
To put with
this motion to dismiss.

521
00:21:01,494 --> 00:21:04,328
If you wanted to file
a motion to dismiss,

522
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:06,163
you would have
done that already.

523
00:21:06,165 --> 00:21:09,600
You want me to sign that thing
to cover your ass.

524
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:11,335
Do I think it's likely

525
00:21:11,337 --> 00:21:12,937
that this case
is gonna get dismissed?

526
00:21:12,939 --> 00:21:16,841
No, but it's worth a shot,
and to your point,

527
00:21:16,843 --> 00:21:18,809
I'm not just doing this
to cover my ass.

528
00:21:18,811 --> 00:21:22,313
I'm doing it to cover your ass.

529
00:21:22,315 --> 00:21:25,383
File the motion.

530
00:21:25,385 --> 00:21:27,418
Harvey will sign
whatever I put in front of him.

531
00:21:33,225 --> 00:21:34,659
I give you one simple task.

532
00:21:34,661 --> 00:21:36,260
Bruno isn't eating,
so you give him milk.

533
00:21:36,262 --> 00:21:38,996
- I did.
- This is half-and-half.

534
00:21:38,998 --> 00:21:41,065
I thought he'd like it.
It's creamier.

535
00:21:41,067 --> 00:21:42,433
Hey, you know what,
maybe next time

536
00:21:42,435 --> 00:21:45,269
I'll just hand my cat over
to Michael Vick.

537
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:55,846
Is that a cat carrier
in your hand?

538
00:21:55,848 --> 00:21:57,081
No.

539
00:21:57,083 --> 00:21:59,216
Is there a cat in that thing?

540
00:21:59,218 --> 00:22:00,518
It's called
a feline transportation unit.

541
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,986
Cat carrier.

542
00:22:01,988 --> 00:22:02,987
Okay, they wouldn't call it
a cat carrier

543
00:22:02,989 --> 00:22:04,322
when it costs $400.

544
00:22:04,324 --> 00:22:06,157
- Do they call it a rip-off?
- Okay, you know what,

545
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:08,192
I don't have time for this.
Besides, I'm late as it is.

546
00:22:08,194 --> 00:22:10,828
I have to ask.
What appointment?

547
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:12,463
- Dentist.
- With a cat?

548
00:22:12,465 --> 00:22:14,231
- For the cat.
- You take him to a cat dentist?

549
00:22:14,233 --> 00:22:15,566
I can't take him to my dentist.

550
00:22:15,568 --> 00:22:17,301
Dr. Schneller wouldn't know
what to do with him.

551
00:22:17,303 --> 00:22:18,836
- Dr. Richard Schneller?
- Good-bye, Harvey.

552
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:20,338
I don't want to hear it.

553
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:21,572
If it's bad news,
I don't want to hear it.

554
00:22:21,574 --> 00:22:23,040
- You seem upset.
- Of course I'm upset.

555
00:22:23,042 --> 00:22:24,108
I just found out
that Louis and I

556
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:25,376
share the same dentist.

557
00:22:25,378 --> 00:22:26,477
Have you spoken to Donna yet?

558
00:22:26,479 --> 00:22:27,545
No, and I'm pissed about it.

559
00:22:27,547 --> 00:22:28,879
I need her to get me
a new dentist.

560
00:22:28,881 --> 00:22:30,247
Well, we have a problem,

561
00:22:30,249 --> 00:22:31,082
whether you want
to hear it or not.

562
00:22:31,084 --> 00:22:32,450
What?

563
00:22:32,452 --> 00:22:33,984
Marco needs to be emancipated
from his father.

564
00:22:33,986 --> 00:22:35,219
But that's not a problem.
That's what we're doing.

565
00:22:35,221 --> 00:22:36,220
No, I don't mean
to let him play.

566
00:22:36,222 --> 00:22:38,456
I mean to keep him safe.

567
00:22:38,458 --> 00:22:40,424
That is directly
from the hospital.

568
00:22:40,426 --> 00:22:42,326
His dad did that to him.

569
00:22:42,328 --> 00:22:43,961
We need to get him away
from his father.

570
00:22:43,963 --> 00:22:45,296
I need to get him away.

571
00:22:45,298 --> 00:22:47,264
I set the hearing,
and I'm going to win.

572
00:22:47,266 --> 00:22:48,532
I'm hearing
a lot of "I" s in there.

573
00:22:48,534 --> 00:22:49,934
- Harvey...
- This isn't housing court.

574
00:22:49,936 --> 00:22:51,302
This is a kid's life.

575
00:22:51,304 --> 00:22:52,837
I know that,
and the only reason

576
00:22:52,839 --> 00:22:54,105
you know that
is because I gave a shit

577
00:22:54,107 --> 00:22:55,639
about this kid's life
in the first place.

578
00:22:55,641 --> 00:22:57,742
You think I didn't think
I was smarter

579
00:22:57,744 --> 00:22:59,543
than the guy
I started working for?

580
00:22:59,545 --> 00:23:02,947
I did, and I was,
and I waited my goddamn turn.

581
00:23:02,949 --> 00:23:04,749
Harvey, I'm ready.

582
00:23:04,751 --> 00:23:05,916
It's time to let me
out of the gate.

583
00:23:05,918 --> 00:23:07,852
Allison's filing
a motion to dismiss.

584
00:23:07,854 --> 00:23:10,488
She's swinging for the fences,
I'll give her that.

585
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:12,656
You know what, I'm gonna
swing for the fences too.

586
00:23:12,658 --> 00:23:14,024
Mike's going to court.

587
00:23:14,026 --> 00:23:16,227
- I am?
- What's the case?

588
00:23:16,229 --> 00:23:17,762
Emancipation.

589
00:23:17,764 --> 00:23:19,764
- From him?
- I wish.

590
00:23:19,766 --> 00:23:21,031
He doesn't need
a court order for that.

591
00:23:21,033 --> 00:23:22,700
- Our little baby's growing up.
- Okay.

592
00:23:22,702 --> 00:23:24,535
Listen, I need you
to sign this affidavit

593
00:23:24,537 --> 00:23:26,704
that we never received
that memo from Coastal Motors.

594
00:23:49,361 --> 00:23:52,363
Oh, my God! Oh, I'm...

595
00:23:52,365 --> 00:23:54,799
There are napkins over there.

596
00:23:54,801 --> 00:23:57,368
I knew he wasn't a lawyer.
I didn't think he was an idiot.

597
00:23:57,370 --> 00:23:58,369
I knew he was an idiot.

598
00:23:58,371 --> 00:23:59,637
I didn't know he was spastic.

599
00:23:59,639 --> 00:24:01,305
I'm sorry, guys.

600
00:24:01,307 --> 00:24:02,673
When you get this cleaned up,
come see me.

601
00:24:02,675 --> 00:24:04,942
I'll get you a fresh one.

602
00:24:04,944 --> 00:24:07,011
- What the hell was that?
- What?

603
00:24:07,013 --> 00:24:08,646
- You know what.
- It was an accident.

604
00:24:08,648 --> 00:24:09,680
It was intentional.

605
00:24:09,682 --> 00:24:11,182
You ambushed me
with a cup of coffee.

606
00:24:11,184 --> 00:24:13,951
Think I haven't seen <i>Ronin?</i>

607
00:24:13,953 --> 00:24:15,085
It was all I could think of.

608
00:24:15,087 --> 00:24:16,153
Meaning?

609
00:24:16,155 --> 00:24:18,289
Donna was supposed to tell you.

610
00:24:18,291 --> 00:24:19,623
Tell me what?

611
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:20,991
You can't sign the affidavit.

612
00:24:20,993 --> 00:24:25,229
You'll be committing perjury.

613
00:24:33,438 --> 00:24:35,606
What the hell
were you thinking?

614
00:24:35,608 --> 00:24:37,107
I didn't know how to tell you.

615
00:24:37,109 --> 00:24:39,243
"Harvey, I found the memo."
Is that so goddamn hard?

616
00:24:39,245 --> 00:24:42,246
You don't understand.
It had my name on it.

617
00:24:42,248 --> 00:24:44,682
I stamped it in.
That implicates you.

618
00:24:44,684 --> 00:24:46,183
Did you keep it
from me four years ago?

619
00:24:46,185 --> 00:24:48,519
I don't even remember
seeing it four years ago.

620
00:24:48,521 --> 00:24:50,020
Then I don't give a shit
what it implicates.

621
00:24:50,022 --> 00:24:51,522
You don't keep it from me now.

622
00:24:51,524 --> 00:24:53,357
I had never made
a mistake like that,

623
00:24:53,359 --> 00:24:54,825
and I thought
that I needed to...

624
00:24:54,827 --> 00:24:56,460
Look, keeping it from me
isn't a mistake.

625
00:24:56,462 --> 00:24:59,396
It's a decision.
I wanted to protect you.

626
00:24:59,398 --> 00:25:01,365
Lying to me doesn't protect me.

627
00:25:01,367 --> 00:25:03,467
It betrays me. Betrays you?

628
00:25:03,469 --> 00:25:05,202
If I had told you the truth...

629
00:25:05,204 --> 00:25:07,104
You don't keep things from me!

630
00:25:07,106 --> 00:25:08,138
You keep things from me
all the time!

631
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:09,607
That's because I'm your boss.

632
00:25:09,609 --> 00:25:11,775
Well, maybe you shouldn't
be my boss anymore.

633
00:25:14,546 --> 00:25:16,280
I did what I thought
I had to do for you,

634
00:25:16,282 --> 00:25:19,483
and if you can't...

635
00:25:19,485 --> 00:25:21,118
just fire me.

636
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,286
Let me explain
something to you.

637
00:25:22,288 --> 00:25:24,388
That memo doesn't hurt me.
It helps me.

638
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:26,724
If I had buried it,
we wouldn't have it.

639
00:25:26,726 --> 00:25:30,227
But you found it,
so that's a good thing.

640
00:25:30,229 --> 00:25:31,996
What?

641
00:25:31,998 --> 00:25:34,832
Wh-what'd you do?

642
00:25:34,834 --> 00:25:36,667
Oh, what did you do?

643
00:25:36,669 --> 00:25:38,836
Allison
had that freaking camera,

644
00:25:38,838 --> 00:25:41,305
and I was...

645
00:25:41,307 --> 00:25:43,440
she implied that we were...

646
00:25:43,442 --> 00:25:45,943
What did you do?

647
00:25:45,945 --> 00:25:47,945
It's gone.

648
00:25:47,947 --> 00:25:51,215
You destroyed it?

649
00:25:52,751 --> 00:25:54,285
I'm not going
to fire you, Donna.

650
00:25:54,287 --> 00:25:58,322
I might kill you,
but I'm not gonna fire you.

651
00:25:58,324 --> 00:25:59,757
What are you going to do?

652
00:25:59,759 --> 00:26:02,526
What you should've done
from day one.

653
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,501
Let me get this straight.

654
00:26:10,503 --> 00:26:12,136
Your own assistant
destroys evidence,

655
00:26:12,138 --> 00:26:13,170
and you still want
to go to trial?

656
00:26:13,172 --> 00:26:14,538
- Yes.
- No.

657
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:16,273
You need to cut a deal
right now.

658
00:26:16,275 --> 00:26:18,375
You mean we need
to cut a deal, right,

659
00:26:18,377 --> 00:26:19,810
because we're
all on the same side?

660
00:26:19,812 --> 00:26:21,345
Harvey.

661
00:26:21,347 --> 00:26:22,313
You think I didn't know
what you were up to

662
00:26:22,315 --> 00:26:23,981
with that affidavit?

663
00:26:23,983 --> 00:26:25,449
I was advising my client,
the firm.

664
00:26:25,451 --> 00:26:28,319
You once told me
I was the firm.

665
00:26:28,321 --> 00:26:31,055
She came to me and thought
that you were in on it.

666
00:26:31,057 --> 00:26:32,923
I said no way.

667
00:26:32,925 --> 00:26:35,059
She wanted you
to sign that thing.

668
00:26:35,061 --> 00:26:37,361
I'm the leader of this firm.
I made a decision.

669
00:26:37,363 --> 00:26:40,331
You were happy to do it.
Don't blame me for Donna.

670
00:26:40,333 --> 00:26:43,901
I'm not, but I need to know
if you still believe me.

671
00:26:43,903 --> 00:26:45,903
- I do.
- That's beside the point.

672
00:26:45,905 --> 00:26:48,072
We have a decision to make.
There is no decision.

673
00:26:48,074 --> 00:26:50,240
We need to cut a deal... today.

674
00:26:50,242 --> 00:26:51,208
You know what,
that's the difference

675
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:52,409
between us, Allison.

676
00:26:52,411 --> 00:26:54,445
You want to lose small.
I want to win big.

677
00:26:54,447 --> 00:26:56,914
She's the one
who has to try the case.

678
00:26:56,916 --> 00:26:58,048
Regardless of what Donna did,

679
00:26:58,050 --> 00:26:59,249
I never saw the memo.

680
00:26:59,251 --> 00:27:00,751
Are you gonna
sell a jury on that?

681
00:27:00,753 --> 00:27:03,420
Maybe the same way you sold it
to the Randall family.

682
00:27:03,422 --> 00:27:06,256
We have a window to settle this
before we have to disclose,

683
00:27:06,258 --> 00:27:07,658
but it's closing,
and when it does,

684
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:09,226
we could offer them the moon.

685
00:27:09,228 --> 00:27:10,427
They're not gonna take it.
What's the downside of asking?

686
00:27:10,429 --> 00:27:12,062
We went through this
with the nurses.

687
00:27:12,064 --> 00:27:15,799
It tells them we're weak.
We are weak.

688
00:27:15,801 --> 00:27:18,636
Set it up.

689
00:27:18,638 --> 00:27:22,272
And whatever you're thinking,
I don't want to hear it.

690
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:59,229
Mr. Mendoza, you've
asserted that, as a parent,

691
00:27:59,231 --> 00:28:01,231
you have certain rights.

692
00:28:01,233 --> 00:28:02,666
Do those include
the right to discipline Marco

693
00:28:02,668 --> 00:28:04,434
as you see fit?

694
00:28:04,436 --> 00:28:06,036
Every parent has that right.

695
00:28:06,038 --> 00:28:08,705
The right to teach
your child a lesson.

696
00:28:08,707 --> 00:28:10,273
- Yes.
- When he defies you.

697
00:28:10,275 --> 00:28:12,809
If need be.

698
00:28:12,811 --> 00:28:15,412
And if need be,
do you get angry?

699
00:28:15,414 --> 00:28:17,714
Do you fly off the handle?
Do you become abusive?

700
00:28:17,716 --> 00:28:19,316
No, I would never go that far.

701
00:28:19,318 --> 00:28:20,650
Mr. Mendoza,
would you agree that,

702
00:28:20,652 --> 00:28:22,219
along with those rights,

703
00:28:22,221 --> 00:28:24,688
you have certain
responsibilities as a parent?

704
00:28:24,690 --> 00:28:26,556
Of course.

705
00:28:26,558 --> 00:28:28,024
The responsibility
to keep your son healthy?

706
00:28:28,026 --> 00:28:30,527
Marco gets up every day
at 4:30 to train.

707
00:28:30,529 --> 00:28:32,028
I think that one's covered.

708
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:34,097
The responsibility
to keep your son safe?

709
00:28:34,099 --> 00:28:35,966
That's the first job
of every parent.

710
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:37,734
Hmm.

711
00:28:37,736 --> 00:28:40,203
Let's talk about
May 18th of last year.

712
00:28:40,205 --> 00:28:41,438
You took your son
to the hospital

713
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:44,207
where he was treated
for severe dehydration.

714
00:28:44,209 --> 00:28:45,342
Rushed my son to keep him safe.

715
00:28:45,344 --> 00:28:46,877
What I'm interested in

716
00:28:46,879 --> 00:28:48,979
is how he got dehydrated
in the first place.

717
00:28:48,981 --> 00:28:50,680
He was running laps.

718
00:28:50,682 --> 00:28:51,848
Hadn't you had an argument

719
00:28:51,850 --> 00:28:53,383
about going pro
the night before?

720
00:28:53,385 --> 00:28:55,218
Yes.

721
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:58,522
And you wanted to teach him
a lesson, as was your right.

722
00:28:58,524 --> 00:29:00,657
What?

723
00:29:00,659 --> 00:29:03,193
He questioned your authority,
didn't he?

724
00:29:03,195 --> 00:29:04,694
He's done it before, hasn't he?

725
00:29:04,696 --> 00:29:06,162
And you don't like that,
do you?

726
00:29:06,164 --> 00:29:07,831
- You are twisting this.
- You got angry,

727
00:29:07,833 --> 00:29:09,966
you flew off the handle,
and you became abusive.

728
00:29:09,968 --> 00:29:11,334
Objection, badgering.

729
00:29:11,336 --> 00:29:12,702
Easy, Mr. Ross.

730
00:29:12,704 --> 00:29:14,437
Marco has never called 911.

731
00:29:14,439 --> 00:29:16,840
He's never reported me
to social services.

732
00:29:16,842 --> 00:29:17,874
He's never complained
to anyone.

733
00:29:17,876 --> 00:29:19,309
They never do.

734
00:29:19,311 --> 00:29:21,411
You think I put my own son
in the hospital?

735
00:29:21,413 --> 00:29:23,146
Oh, I've read this report.
I know you did.

736
00:29:23,148 --> 00:29:24,414
And I know you will again.

737
00:29:24,416 --> 00:29:26,850
You are a lying
little piece of shit.

738
00:29:26,852 --> 00:29:29,219
- And there it is.
- Mr. Mendoza, that's enough.

739
00:29:32,356 --> 00:29:35,225
No further questions.

740
00:29:40,866 --> 00:29:43,033
Oh, what the hell?
You don't sneak up like that.

741
00:29:43,035 --> 00:29:45,936
I wasn't sneaking up.
I was just getting coffee.

742
00:29:45,938 --> 00:29:47,804
Yeah, well,
the paralegal needs coffee.

743
00:29:47,806 --> 00:29:49,973
I guess the junior partner
needs to get out of her way.

744
00:29:49,975 --> 00:29:51,675
You know what, Louis,
if you treated people here

745
00:29:51,677 --> 00:29:53,410
just a tenth as nicely
as you treat your cat,

746
00:29:53,412 --> 00:29:55,812
they might not feel about you
the way that you know they do.

747
00:29:55,814 --> 00:29:57,814
I'm sorry.

748
00:29:57,816 --> 00:29:59,416
Is everything okay?

749
00:29:59,418 --> 00:30:03,520
No, I just have, like,
a condition with my tear ducts.

750
00:30:03,522 --> 00:30:06,022
Oh, my God.

751
00:30:08,259 --> 00:30:09,759
I just assumed
that he wasn't eating

752
00:30:09,761 --> 00:30:12,495
because of his toothache...

753
00:30:12,497 --> 00:30:16,533
but it turns out
his hygiene was perfect.

754
00:30:16,535 --> 00:30:19,936
But of course it was, because
we flossed every day, so...

755
00:30:21,706 --> 00:30:23,807
And then they did these tests.

756
00:30:23,809 --> 00:30:26,810
And I told the vet,
"money is no object,"

757
00:30:26,812 --> 00:30:30,780
but, uh...

758
00:30:30,782 --> 00:30:33,149
it was too late.

759
00:30:33,151 --> 00:30:36,119
Bruno was suffering...

760
00:30:36,121 --> 00:30:39,422
Excuse me. No...

761
00:30:44,829 --> 00:30:47,764
- hey.
- Hey.

762
00:30:47,766 --> 00:30:51,735
- Is everything okay?
- Not exactly.

763
00:30:51,737 --> 00:30:53,503
Okay, I'll come back
when you're finished.

764
00:30:53,505 --> 00:30:54,871
I wasn't talking about you.

765
00:30:54,873 --> 00:30:56,806
Not everything's about you,
you know.

766
00:30:56,808 --> 00:30:58,908
Now, you see,
that's where you're wrong.

767
00:31:00,144 --> 00:31:02,479
What's going on with Donna?

768
00:31:02,481 --> 00:31:03,780
I don't know.

769
00:31:03,782 --> 00:31:05,915
What do you mean?

770
00:31:05,917 --> 00:31:08,151
I saw you watching us
the other day.

771
00:31:08,153 --> 00:31:12,088
You know something.

772
00:31:12,090 --> 00:31:15,325
Come on, Mike, how many secrets
are you gonna keep from me?

773
00:31:15,327 --> 00:31:18,328
It's not mine. It's Donna's.

774
00:31:18,330 --> 00:31:19,996
I'm not saying you need
to give me specifics.

775
00:31:19,998 --> 00:31:23,767
I just need to know
that she's okay.

776
00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:29,939
She screwed up,
and it's not small.

777
00:31:29,941 --> 00:31:34,277
- What's gonna happen?
- Harvey's going to fix it.

778
00:31:34,279 --> 00:31:35,945
How do you know?

779
00:31:35,947 --> 00:31:38,615
You're gonna fix this
situation with Donna, right?

780
00:31:38,617 --> 00:31:41,084
- Why should I tell you?
- What?

781
00:31:41,086 --> 00:31:42,385
If I hadn't caught you,
when were you gonna tell me

782
00:31:42,387 --> 00:31:43,753
that she had that memo?

783
00:31:43,755 --> 00:31:45,188
I wasn't, 'cause
she promised me she would.

784
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:46,856
Well, what would have
happened if you hadn't been

785
00:31:46,858 --> 00:31:49,092
in my office when Jessica
brought me that affidavit?

786
00:31:49,094 --> 00:31:50,293
That would've been
between you and Donna.

787
00:31:50,295 --> 00:31:52,996
And I would have
committed perjury.

788
00:31:52,998 --> 00:31:55,231
You're right.
I should have told you,

789
00:31:55,233 --> 00:31:58,134
or had Donna tell you then
and there, but I was thinking

790
00:31:58,136 --> 00:32:00,470
the fact that she actually
found this thing helps us.

791
00:32:00,472 --> 00:32:02,405
Yeah, it would've helped us.

792
00:32:02,407 --> 00:32:05,075
She destroyed it.

793
00:32:05,077 --> 00:32:06,876
- Whoa.
- Yeah.

794
00:32:06,878 --> 00:32:08,244
Whoa.

795
00:32:08,246 --> 00:32:09,646
Harvey, she was
backed into a corner.

796
00:32:09,648 --> 00:32:10,980
She made a bad call.

797
00:32:10,982 --> 00:32:12,449
Look, we can still...
Tell the truth?

798
00:32:12,451 --> 00:32:14,451
How do you think
that's going to play in court?

799
00:32:18,055 --> 00:32:20,390
Oh, my God. Um, I have to go.

800
00:32:20,392 --> 00:32:21,658
You screwed up with Marco,
didn't you?

801
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:22,992
I'm on it.

802
00:32:22,994 --> 00:32:24,994
And this thing with Donna,
just let it go.

803
00:32:24,996 --> 00:32:28,431
I'm sure she said she was sorry.
She is sorry.

804
00:32:28,433 --> 00:32:31,634
But she never said it.

805
00:32:34,772 --> 00:32:36,706
Didn't expect to see you today.

806
00:32:36,708 --> 00:32:38,575
I wanted to get you the offer
as soon as I could.

807
00:32:38,577 --> 00:32:39,876
You could have called.

808
00:32:39,878 --> 00:32:42,312
No, I couldn't.

809
00:32:42,314 --> 00:32:44,147
Tanner's terms.

810
00:32:44,149 --> 00:32:45,582
The firm pays
$5 million in damages,

811
00:32:45,584 --> 00:32:46,750
as well as all legal fees.

812
00:32:46,752 --> 00:32:49,352
What else?

813
00:32:49,354 --> 00:32:51,454
Pearson Hardman
immediately and irrevocably

814
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:55,892
strips Harvey Specter
of his senior partnership

815
00:32:55,894 --> 00:32:59,062
and reports him to
the New York Bar Association.

816
00:32:59,064 --> 00:33:01,164
I know this isn't
what you want to hear,

817
00:33:01,166 --> 00:33:05,335
but I would
take this deal and run.

818
00:33:11,542 --> 00:33:14,577
What do you want now?

819
00:33:14,579 --> 00:33:17,213
Sell me a vacuum cleaner?
Set of steak knives?

820
00:33:17,215 --> 00:33:18,348
I don't want
to sell you anything.

821
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:20,150
I'm not here to do that.

822
00:33:20,152 --> 00:33:22,385
I'm here to tell you
that I'm sorry.

823
00:33:22,387 --> 00:33:26,055
I should have known
about that memo.

824
00:33:26,057 --> 00:33:27,624
But I didn't do my job.

825
00:33:27,626 --> 00:33:29,492
If I had, you and I
wouldn't be here right now.

826
00:33:29,494 --> 00:33:30,493
But we are here right now

827
00:33:30,495 --> 00:33:33,163
because of what you did
to my husband.

828
00:33:33,165 --> 00:33:35,799
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

829
00:33:35,801 --> 00:33:37,400
I never should have done it.

830
00:33:37,402 --> 00:33:41,504
My mother marched, Mr. lawyer.

831
00:33:41,506 --> 00:33:44,707
They set dogs on her.
I saw the scars.

832
00:33:44,709 --> 00:33:47,343
She said it wasn't the dogs,
it was the men.

833
00:33:47,345 --> 00:33:50,513
I say, put those dogs down.

834
00:33:52,748 --> 00:33:54,282
So you think
we should take this deal?

835
00:33:55,128 --> 00:33:57,095
I think we have to.

836
00:33:57,097 --> 00:33:58,763
Just say it.

837
00:33:58,765 --> 00:34:00,832
You want me
to cut Harvey loose.

838
00:34:00,834 --> 00:34:02,700
You've never been afraid
to spill blood before.

839
00:34:02,702 --> 00:34:04,502
You means yours.

840
00:34:04,504 --> 00:34:06,037
I was actually referring
to when you and I

841
00:34:06,039 --> 00:34:07,872
crossed the other names
off the letterhead.

842
00:34:07,874 --> 00:34:09,607
That was for
the good of the firm.

843
00:34:09,609 --> 00:34:11,743
Was it?

844
00:34:14,613 --> 00:34:16,381
Evidence was destroyed,
Jessica.

845
00:34:16,383 --> 00:34:19,884
- Not by Harvey.
- On his watch, therefore...

846
00:34:19,886 --> 00:34:20,919
On mine.

847
00:34:20,921 --> 00:34:22,353
If this were anyone else,

848
00:34:22,355 --> 00:34:23,621
you'd be seeing it
the same way I do.

849
00:34:23,623 --> 00:34:25,790
I'm not scapegoating him.

850
00:34:25,792 --> 00:34:28,259
You care about Harvey.
I know that.

851
00:34:28,261 --> 00:34:29,427
But I also know
that you care about

852
00:34:29,429 --> 00:34:31,529
your position in this firm.

853
00:34:31,531 --> 00:34:33,231
A law was broken.

854
00:34:33,233 --> 00:34:35,533
Are you really going
to sit by and do nothing?

855
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:41,739
I've got to call you back.

856
00:34:41,741 --> 00:34:44,142
Did you get it?
Got it right here,

857
00:34:44,144 --> 00:34:45,977
fully executed emancipation.

858
00:34:45,979 --> 00:34:47,245
You tell Marco yet?

859
00:34:47,247 --> 00:34:48,046
No, I wanted you
to see it first.

860
00:34:48,048 --> 00:34:49,347
Nice job.

861
00:34:49,349 --> 00:34:50,548
This way I can call him
with the good news.

862
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:53,518
- Yeah, just one problem.
- What's that?

863
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,386
Marco lied.

864
00:34:55,388 --> 00:34:57,121
- What?
- Yeah.

865
00:34:57,123 --> 00:34:58,623
We got backed into a corner,

866
00:34:58,625 --> 00:35:00,191
and he knew the truth
wouldn't play in court,

867
00:35:00,193 --> 00:35:02,560
so he made up a story.

868
00:35:02,562 --> 00:35:04,929
If it was a lie, Michael,
then why didn't Oscar say so?

869
00:35:04,931 --> 00:35:06,397
Marco perjured himself.

870
00:35:06,399 --> 00:35:07,699
You really think his father

871
00:35:07,701 --> 00:35:09,100
was going to be the one
to point that out?

872
00:35:09,102 --> 00:35:10,802
- That's a lot of conjecture.
- Yeah, it would be.

873
00:35:10,804 --> 00:35:12,804
But I went to see Oscar.

874
00:35:12,806 --> 00:35:15,406
Turns out he wasn't even there
when Marco ran those laps.

875
00:35:15,408 --> 00:35:17,342
But you were.
Nuhuh, it's bullshit.

876
00:35:17,344 --> 00:35:19,410
I saw the look
on your face in court.

877
00:35:19,412 --> 00:35:21,880
You knew, and you did nothing.

878
00:35:24,717 --> 00:35:27,218
You got me.

879
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:28,686
But it doesn't matter,
'cause we won.

880
00:35:28,688 --> 00:35:30,121
No, we didn't.

881
00:35:30,123 --> 00:35:32,857
'Cause I'm not filing papers
based on a lie.

882
00:35:32,859 --> 00:35:34,259
Harvey is gonna make you
regret that.

883
00:35:34,261 --> 00:35:37,428
Harvey's not gonna do shit.

884
00:35:37,430 --> 00:35:41,032
This is my case,
and you are done.

It's subtle, but Daniel's
strong-arming me.

888
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:01,019
Not now.

889
00:36:01,021 --> 00:36:03,221
My dad.

I was wrong.

892
00:36:19,406 --> 00:36:22,006
Am I in the right office?

893
00:36:22,008 --> 00:36:24,442
I went to the plaintiffs again.

894
00:36:24,444 --> 00:36:26,511
Why?

895
00:36:26,513 --> 00:36:27,979
To tell them I was sorry.

896
00:36:27,981 --> 00:36:30,915
Harvey, there is
a deal on the table.

897
00:36:30,917 --> 00:36:33,685
Allison's right.

898
00:36:33,687 --> 00:36:36,054
I shouldn't be the lawyer.

899
00:36:36,056 --> 00:36:38,589
I don't even
make a good client.

Neither do I.

But I've got some hard news
I have to tell you.

902
00:36:47,866 --> 00:36:49,367
Okay, let me guess,

903
00:36:49,369 --> 00:36:50,802
you're here
to take me up on my offer

904
00:36:50,804 --> 00:36:52,737
to trade offices. No.

905
00:36:52,739 --> 00:36:55,807
But I did happen to find these.

906
00:36:55,809 --> 00:36:57,041
Who still eats Twinkies?

Who doesn't still eat Twinkies?

What's up?

909
00:37:02,482 --> 00:37:05,016
- I need a favor.
- Okay, what?

910
00:37:05,018 --> 00:37:07,285
Is this from
your tennis client?

911
00:37:07,287 --> 00:37:09,220
First one.

912
00:37:09,222 --> 00:37:10,989
Not as big as Harvey's.

913
00:37:10,991 --> 00:37:12,490
Really? You're gonna go there?

914
00:37:12,492 --> 00:37:14,625
It's probably gonna be
worth a lot of money someday.

915
00:37:14,627 --> 00:37:16,361
- Probably.
- I need it.

916
00:37:16,363 --> 00:37:17,729
It's important.

917

Daniel,

920
00:37:32,012 --> 00:37:35,847
will you come to
my office right now please?

921
00:37:42,488 --> 00:37:43,855
Have a seat.

922
00:37:43,857 --> 00:37:46,290
Couldn't we have done this
in my office?

923
00:37:46,292 --> 00:37:49,494
Yes, we could have,
but I prefer to do it here...

924
00:37:49,496 --> 00:37:52,563
in your old office.

925
00:37:54,733 --> 00:37:56,200
What's this?

926
00:37:56,202 --> 00:37:58,336
I want you to
let Allison Holt go.

927
00:37:58,338 --> 00:38:00,538
- Why would I do that?
- Why you?

928
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:02,673
Because you brought her in
initially.

929
00:38:02,675 --> 00:38:05,710
I am extending you
the courtesy of letting her go.

930
00:38:05,712 --> 00:38:08,246
As for why at all,

931
00:38:08,248 --> 00:38:11,516
I do care about
my position in this firm

932
00:38:11,518 --> 00:38:14,385
and my position is that we win.

933
00:38:14,387 --> 00:38:17,221
We win, Harvey wins,

934
00:38:17,223 --> 00:38:18,222
and I win.

935
00:38:18,224 --> 00:38:19,791
Allison Holt can't win,

936
00:38:19,793 --> 00:38:21,392
because she doesn't
believe in Harvey.

937
00:38:21,394 --> 00:38:24,295
I can, because I do.

938
00:38:24,297 --> 00:38:26,397
- It's your decision.
- It is.

939
00:38:26,399 --> 00:38:29,700
But don't try to pass it off
as a courtesy.

940
00:38:29,702 --> 00:38:31,969
You're trying to humiliate me,

941
00:38:31,971 --> 00:38:34,205
like you did by summoning me
into your office.

942
00:38:34,207 --> 00:38:37,375
I summoned you because
I wanted you to understand

943
00:38:37,377 --> 00:38:39,277
who you were
threatening earlier.

944
00:38:39,279 --> 00:38:41,879
I wasn't threatening you.

945
00:38:41,881 --> 00:38:44,415
I was pointing out facts. Yes.

946
00:38:44,417 --> 00:38:46,250
The fact that,
if I'm not careful,

947
00:38:46,252 --> 00:38:47,852
you'll try to take
this office back.

948
00:38:47,854 --> 00:38:49,821
That's not going to happen.

949
00:38:49,823 --> 00:38:55,193
And as for your point
about a law being broken,

950
00:38:55,195 --> 00:38:57,095
you're right.

951
00:38:57,097 --> 00:39:00,331
I'm not going to sit by
and do nothing.

955
00:39:13,746 --> 00:39:17,548
I just know what
a huge tennis fan you are.

956
00:39:24,123 --> 00:39:26,891
Rachel...

957
00:39:30,095 --> 00:39:33,131
could you just close
the door on your way out?

958
00:39:33,133 --> 00:39:36,167
Sure thing, Louis.

959
00:39:56,388 --> 00:39:58,890

Oh.

962
00:40:03,196 --> 00:40:07,165
He wanted to be the one to
have this conversation with you.

963
00:40:07,167 --> 00:40:08,599
But it's my firm,

964

to hear it from me.

Am I being fired?

966
00:40:13,106 --> 00:40:16,174
Yes.

967

for Harvey and for me,

969

but whatever
my personal feelings,

970
00:40:23,149 --> 00:40:26,250
your actions
have left me no choice

971
00:40:26,252 --> 00:40:28,486
but to terminate your employment
at Pearson Hardman

972
00:40:28,488 --> 00:40:30,888
effective immediately.
