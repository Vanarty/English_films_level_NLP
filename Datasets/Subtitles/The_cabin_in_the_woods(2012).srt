1
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:01,983
It's hormonal.

2
00:01:01,984 --> 00:01:07,322
I mean, I don't usually fall
back on.. It's women's issues.

3
00:01:07,323 --> 00:01:10,789
But child-proofed how?
Gates and stuff?

4
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:12,183
Dude, she did the drawers.

5
00:01:12,184 --> 00:01:14,501
We don't even know if this
whole fertility thing's gonna work..

6
00:01:14,502 --> 00:01:17,370
she's screwed in these little jobbies
where you can't even open the drawers.

7
00:01:17,371 --> 00:01:18,267
At all?

8
00:01:18,268 --> 00:01:21,400
No. They open an inch,
then you gotta dig your finger in.

9
00:01:21,401 --> 00:01:23,729
- It's a nightmare.
-I guess sooner or later..

10
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:26,209
Yeah, a lot later.
She did the upper cabinets.

11
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:30,194
Kid will be 30 before he can
reach them, assuming we have a kid.

12
00:01:32,141 --> 00:01:34,400
It is natural for
her to feel protective.

13
00:01:34,401 --> 00:01:36,816
Don't even.. You have women's issues.

14
00:01:36,817 --> 00:01:39,699
Please. You of all people.

15
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,299
Oh, come on. It's a jinx.

16
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:44,668
It guarantees that
we won't get pregnant.

17
00:01:44,669 --> 00:01:47,710
And it takes me about 20
minutes to get a fucking beer.

18
00:01:47,711 --> 00:01:49,066
Guys. Guys!

19
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:50,331
Stockholm went south.

20
00:01:50,332 --> 00:01:53,451
Seriously?
I thought they were looking good.

21
00:01:53,452 --> 00:01:54,554
What cracked?

22
00:01:54,555 --> 00:01:57,671
I haven't seen the footage.
Word's just going around

23
00:01:57,672 --> 00:01:59,777
Well, that's never
been a stable scenario.

24
00:01:59,778 --> 00:02:01,862
Everyone knows you can't trust Swedes.

25
00:02:01,863 --> 00:02:04,599
That means there's just Japan.
Japan and us.

26
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,366
It's not the first time
it's come down to that.

27
00:02:06,367 --> 00:02:08,210
Japan has a perfect record.

28
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:09,698
We're number two. We try harder.

29
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:11,279
If we fail, then..

30
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,034
Please. We haven't
had a glitch since '98.

31
00:02:13,035 --> 00:02:14,469
We know what we're doing, Lin.

32
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:16,961
Or we have it written down..
somewhere.

33
00:02:16,962 --> 00:02:18,761
You guys better not
be messing around in there.

34
00:02:18,762 --> 00:02:22,065
Does this mean you're not in
the betting pool this year? Big money.

35
00:02:22,066 --> 00:02:25,169
I'm just saying, it's a key scenario.

36
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:26,751
No, I hear what you're saying.

37
00:02:26,752 --> 00:02:29,965
In '98, it was the chem
department's fault, right?

38
00:02:29,966 --> 00:02:33,382
Where do you work, again?
Wait. It's coming back to me, now.

39
00:02:34,729 --> 00:02:37,970
It's gonna be a long weekend
if everyone's that puckered up.

40
00:02:38,895 --> 00:02:40,805
You wanna come over Monday night?

41
00:02:40,806 --> 00:02:44,518
I'm gonna pick up some power drills.
Liberate my cabinets.

42
00:02:44,843 --> 00:02:47,350
Are you even listening to me?

43
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:34,917
Professor fuckwad.

44
00:03:34,918 --> 00:03:37,824
Why haven't you stuck that asshole's
picture on the dartboard yet?

45
00:03:37,825 --> 00:03:40,902
It's not that simple
Oh, my God!

46
00:03:40,903 --> 00:03:43,569
- Your hair. It's blonde.
- Very fabulous, no?

47
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:46,405
- I can't believe you did it.
-But very fabulous, right?

48
00:03:46,406 --> 00:03:50,165
Hurry up with the "very fabulous."
I'm getting insecure about it now.

49
00:03:50,166 --> 00:03:52,909
No, it looks awesome.
Curt's gonna lose it.

50
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:55,869
Curt's gonna thank me.
And so will you..

51
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:57,831
while we're burning this picture.

52
00:03:57,832 --> 00:03:59,017
Not ready.

53
00:03:59,018 --> 00:04:01,839
Seriously, this isn't his fault.

54
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,189
What's not his fault?

55
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:07,624
Fucking his student or
breaking up with her by email?

56
00:04:07,625 --> 00:04:09,591
I knew what I was getting into.

57
00:04:09,592 --> 00:04:10,303
Oh, please.

58
00:04:10,304 --> 00:04:12,118
You know what you're
getting into this weekend?

59
00:04:13,441 --> 00:04:15,302
This.

60
00:04:15,303 --> 00:04:18,079
And if Holden's as
cute as Curt says he is..

61
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,767
possibly getting out of it.

62
00:04:19,768 --> 00:04:21,987
That is the last thing that I want.

63
00:04:21,988 --> 00:04:24,626
If you treat this like a setup,
I'm gonna have no fun at all.

64
00:04:24,627 --> 00:04:25,772
I'm not pushing..

65
00:04:25,773 --> 00:04:28,113
but we're packing this!

66
00:04:29,522 --> 00:04:32,108
Which means we definitely
won't have room for..

67
00:04:32,109 --> 00:04:33,722
What if I get bored?

68
00:04:33,723 --> 00:04:35,107
These will help?

69
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:39,471
Soviet Economic Structures?
Aftermath of the..

70
00:04:39,472 --> 00:04:43,552
No! We have a lake and a keg.

71
00:04:43,553 --> 00:04:45,334
No more learning!
-Think fast.

72
00:04:45,335 --> 00:04:46,949
Faster than that.

73
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:51,277
Sorry. Sorry. Move along.

74
00:04:51,278 --> 00:04:54,092
Nice!
-Is that Holden?

75
00:04:54,093 --> 00:04:56,897
We'll be right down.
He just transferred from State.

76
00:04:56,898 --> 00:04:59,604
Best hands on the team.
He's a sweet guy.

77
00:04:59,605 --> 00:05:01,116
And he's good with his hands.

78
00:05:01,117 --> 00:05:03,662
I'm kinda seeing this girl..

79
00:05:03,663 --> 00:05:06,085
but you're way blonder than she is.

80
00:05:06,086 --> 00:05:09,897
But I was thinking, you know, maybe..
What is this?

81
00:05:09,898 --> 00:05:12,177
What.. this?
What are you doing with these?

82
00:05:12,001 --> 00:05:13,626
Okay, I get it. I'll leave the books.

83
00:05:13,627 --> 00:05:15,884
No, who gave you these?
Who taught you about these?

84
00:05:15,885 --> 00:05:17,756
I learned it from you, okay?

85
00:05:17,757 --> 00:05:20,084
I learned it from watching you!

86
00:05:20,085 --> 00:05:25,481
Seriously, Professor Bennett, he
covers this whole book in his lectures.

87
00:05:26,413 --> 00:05:29,545
You should read this.

88
00:05:29,546 --> 00:05:32,047
Gurovsky. Now this is way
more interesting.

89
00:05:32,048 --> 00:05:33,774
Also, Bennett doesn't
know it by heart..

90
00:05:33,775 --> 00:05:35,443
so he'll think you're insightful.

91
00:05:35,444 --> 00:05:38,362
And you have no pants.

92
00:05:38,363 --> 00:05:40,606
Oh, shit!

93
00:05:45,644 --> 00:05:47,589
- That pretty much it?
-Fucking better be.

94
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:50,453
You know, Jules,
it's a weekend, not an evacuation.

95
00:05:50,454 --> 00:05:53,717
Trust me when I say there
is nothing in those cases..

96
00:05:53,718 --> 00:05:55,060
you won't be glad I brought.

97
00:05:55,061 --> 00:05:56,994
I'm shutting' right up.

98
00:05:58,924 --> 00:06:02,792
Oh, my God.

99
00:06:06,648 --> 00:06:07,747
Marty!

100
00:06:10,577 --> 00:06:12,345
Fuck is wrong with you, bro?

101
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:20,010
People in this town drive
in a very counterintuitive manner.

102
00:06:20,934 --> 00:06:22,801
That's what I have to say.

103
00:06:22,802 --> 00:06:25,204
Do you wanna spend
the weekend in jail?

104
00:06:25,205 --> 00:06:27,550
We'd all like to check
out my cousin's country home.

105
00:06:27,551 --> 00:06:29,175
Honey, that's not okay.

106
00:06:29,176 --> 00:06:30,779
Statistical fact..

107
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:34,900
Cops will never pull over
a man with a huge bong in his car.

108
00:06:34,901 --> 00:06:35,513
Why?

109
00:06:35,514 --> 00:06:39,477
They fear this man.
They know he sees further than they..

110
00:06:41,024 --> 00:06:44,129
and he will bind them
with ancient logics.

111
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,307
Have you gone gray?

112
00:06:47,308 --> 00:06:49,656
You're not bringing
that thing in the Rambler.

113
00:06:49,657 --> 00:06:50,959
What?

114
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,989
A giant bong in your father's van?

115
00:06:55,841 --> 00:06:57,111
What are you, stoned?

116
00:06:58,698 --> 00:06:59,977
Hey, man.

117
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:05,011
Dana, you fetching minx!

118
00:07:05,012 --> 00:07:06,640
You have any food?

119
00:07:08,514 --> 00:07:09,787
Everybody ready?
- Yeah!

120
00:07:09,788 --> 00:07:13,062
Yeah?
- Okay, I'm ready!

121
00:07:13,063 --> 00:07:15,457
Let's get this show on the road!

122
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,152
Nest is empty. We're right on time.

123
00:07:39,636 --> 00:07:40,829
I hope this is the right road.

124
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:43,261
It doesn't even show up on the GPS.

125
00:07:43,262 --> 00:07:45,300
It is unworthy of global positioning.

126
00:07:45,301 --> 00:07:49,210
That's the whole point.
Get off the grid, right?

127
00:07:49,211 --> 00:07:51,553
No cell phone reception..

128
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:53,843
no traffic cameras.

129
00:07:53,844 --> 00:07:57,144
Go someplace for one goddamn
weekend where they can't..

130
00:07:57,145 --> 00:07:59,739
globally position my ass, man.

131
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:02,225
This is the whole issue.

132
00:08:02,226 --> 00:08:03,985
Is society crumbling, Marty?

133
00:08:03,986 --> 00:08:06,648
No. Society is binding. Right?

134
00:08:06,649 --> 00:08:09,939
It's filling in the
cracks with concrete.

135
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:14,538
Everything's filed or
recorded or blogged, right?

136
00:08:14,539 --> 00:08:17,953
Chips in our kids' heads
so they won't get lost.

137
00:08:17,954 --> 00:08:20,114
Society needs to crumble.

138
00:08:20,115 --> 00:08:23,036
We're all just too
chicken-shit to let it.

139
00:08:23,037 --> 00:08:24,726
I've missed your rants.

140
00:08:24,727 --> 00:08:27,903
You will come to see things my way.

141
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:34,833
Identification, please.

142
00:08:37,831 --> 00:08:39,185
Mr. Sitterson.

143
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:42,210
Mr. Hadley.
- Thank you.

144
00:08:42,211 --> 00:08:44,389
What's your name?
- Daniel Truman, sir.

145
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:46,704
This isn't the military.
You can drop the "sir".

146
00:08:46,705 --> 00:08:50,461
But Sitterson does
like to be called "ma'am."

147
00:08:50,462 --> 00:08:53,107
Or "honey toes."
- He'll also answer to "honey toes."

148
00:08:53,108 --> 00:08:54,378
You clear on what's
gonna be happening here?

149
00:08:54,379 --> 00:08:55,871
I've been prepped. Extensively.

150
00:08:55,872 --> 00:08:59,011
Did they tell you that being prepped
is not the same as being prepared?

151
00:08:59,012 --> 00:09:01,611
They told me.
I'll hold my post, Mr. Hadley.

152
00:09:01,612 --> 00:09:02,361
Good man.

153
00:09:03,725 --> 00:09:05,790
Okay. System's online.

154
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:09,572
Acquiring target.
Let's see what we got.

155
00:09:45,785 --> 00:09:47,898
I'm thinking this thing
doesn't take credit cards.

156
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,734
I don't think it knows about money.

157
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:54,137
I think it's barter gas.

158
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:16,662
Hello?

159
00:10:25,854 --> 00:10:26,770
Hey, Holden.

160
00:10:28,082 --> 00:10:31,472
Holden!
- I don't think there's gonna be..

161
00:10:31,473 --> 00:10:33,790
You come here uninvited?
- Fuck!

162
00:10:39,657 --> 00:10:41,378
Sign says "closed."

163
00:10:41,379 --> 00:10:44,087
Yeah, we were looking to buy some gas.

164
00:10:45,079 --> 00:10:46,464
Does this pump work?

165
00:10:46,465 --> 00:10:48,066
If you know how to work it.

166
00:10:49,346 --> 00:10:51,491
We also wanted to get directions.

167
00:10:51,492 --> 00:10:53,723
We're looking for.. What's it called?

168
00:10:53,724 --> 00:10:56,299
Tillerman Road.
Do you know if it's this way?

169
00:10:58,259 --> 00:11:02,784
Tillerman Road takes
you up the hill, there.

170
00:11:02,785 --> 00:11:04,827
Dead-ends at the old Buckner place.

171
00:11:04,828 --> 00:11:06,860
My cousin bought a house up there.

172
00:11:06,861 --> 00:11:08,986
You go through a mountain tunnel,
there's a lake.

173
00:11:08,987 --> 00:11:11,292
Would that be the..
- Buckner place.

174
00:11:11,293 --> 00:11:14,455
Always someone looking
to sell that plot.

175
00:11:14,456 --> 00:11:16,345
You knew the original owners.

176
00:11:16,346 --> 00:11:18,835
Yeah, not the first.

177
00:11:20,107 --> 00:11:24,169
I seen plenty come and go.
Hell, I been here since the war.

178
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:26,714
- Which war?
- You know damn well which war!

179
00:11:26,715 --> 00:11:32,419
Would that have been with
the blue and some in gray?

180
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:36,823
Brother, perhaps,
fighting against brother in that war?

181
00:11:36,824 --> 00:11:37,915
You sassing me, boy?

182
00:11:37,916 --> 00:11:39,543
You were rude to my friend.

183
00:11:39,544 --> 00:11:42,235
That whore?

184
00:11:42,236 --> 00:11:45,750
What'd you say?
-I think we got enough gas.

185
00:11:45,751 --> 00:11:46,999
You got enough to get you there.

186
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,010
Getting back..

187
00:11:49,011 --> 00:11:51,031
that's your concern.

188
00:12:04,131 --> 00:12:06,944
Well, good luck with
your business, sir.

189
00:12:06,945 --> 00:12:10,040
I know the railroad's coming
through here any day, now.

190
00:12:10,041 --> 00:12:11,042
That's gonna be big.

191
00:12:11,043 --> 00:12:14,455
Streets paved with actual street.

192
00:12:14,456 --> 00:12:16,565
Fucker.

193
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:34,551
This must be it.

194
00:13:48,263 --> 00:13:51,047
Oh, my God. It's.. beautiful.

195
00:13:51,048 --> 00:13:54,322
One spider and I'm
sleeping in the Rambler.

196
00:13:54,323 --> 00:13:55,860
I mean it.

197
00:13:55,861 --> 00:13:58,505
Come on. Give me a hand.

198
00:14:55,132 --> 00:14:57,145
This is awesome.

199
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:58,666
It is kind of cool.

200
00:14:58,667 --> 00:15:00,958
You gonna kill us a raccoon to eat?

201
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:02,595
I will use its skin to make a cap.

202
00:15:04,388 --> 00:15:08,398
Everybody get your suits on. In
10 minutes, we're heading to the lake.

203
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:09,383
Yeah.

204
00:15:09,384 --> 00:15:12,425
I was not informed there
would be calisthenics.

205
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,289
Yeah, I don't think so.

206
00:15:41,719 --> 00:15:43,167
Whoa.

207
00:15:47,096 --> 00:15:49,006
No way.

208
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:08,918
Ah, shit.

209
00:16:13,552 --> 00:16:14,765
This is happening.

210
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:25,818
Hold up!

211
00:16:26,951 --> 00:16:30,815
You've gotta be fucking kidding me.

212
00:16:30,816 --> 00:16:32,413
That's just creepy.

213
00:16:32,414 --> 00:16:34,945
It was pioneer days.

214
00:16:34,946 --> 00:16:37,947
People had to make their
own interrogation rooms.

215
00:16:37,948 --> 00:16:39,601
Who did your cousin
buy this place from?

216
00:16:39,602 --> 00:16:42,312
We should check the rest of the rooms,
make sure this is the only one.

217
00:16:42,313 --> 00:16:44,668
'Cause you know Marty wants
to watch us pounding away.

218
00:16:44,669 --> 00:16:47,509
I didn't even like hearing that.

219
00:16:52,131 --> 00:16:54,627
How about we switch?

220
00:16:55,906 --> 00:16:56,826
Not that I'd..

221
00:16:56,827 --> 00:17:00,062
I mean, I'd put the picture back but you
might feel better if we switched rooms?

222
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,512
I really would.

223
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:08,456
Thanks. For being decent.

224
00:17:08,457 --> 00:17:09,521
It's the least I could do..

225
00:17:09,522 --> 00:17:11,896
since Curt and Jules
sold you to me for marriage.

226
00:17:11,897 --> 00:17:14,443
They're not subtle.

227
00:17:14,444 --> 00:17:17,205
Well, I'll just be flattered
and keep it to myself.

228
00:17:17,206 --> 00:17:19,650
Yeah, I'm not looking for..

229
00:17:19,651 --> 00:17:22,032
But, I'm still grateful
that you're not a creep.

230
00:17:22,033 --> 00:17:24,699
Hey, let's not jump
to any conclusions there.

231
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:27,328
I had kind of an internal
debate about showing you the mirror.

232
00:17:27,329 --> 00:17:30,178
Shouting on both sides.
Blood was spilled.

233
00:17:30,179 --> 00:17:32,129
So, you're bleeding internally?

234
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:33,659
Pretty bad.

235
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:38,085
Well, Jules is pre-med.
You should probably talk to her.

236
00:17:39,253 --> 00:17:41,830
Okay.

237
00:18:09,102 --> 00:18:10,264
Wow.

238
00:18:25,786 --> 00:18:33,278
Yeah, I don't think so.

239
00:19:02,058 --> 00:19:03,289
Places everyone.

240
00:19:04,678 --> 00:19:05,809
We are live.

241
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:07,157
Engineering, we got a room change.

242
00:19:07,158 --> 00:19:09,816
Polk is now in two, McCrea is in four.

243
00:19:09,817 --> 00:19:13,404
Operations, do you copy?
We need a scenario adjustment.

244
00:19:13,405 --> 00:19:14,660
Miss Lin.

245
00:19:16,267 --> 00:19:20,863
We've got the blood work
back on Louden. Her levels are good.

246
00:19:20,864 --> 00:19:23,160
But we're recommending
a fifty-milligram bump..

247
00:19:23,161 --> 00:19:25,065
of Rhohyptase to increase libido.

248
00:19:25,066 --> 00:19:27,760
- Sold. - Do we pipe it in,
or do you wanna do it orally?

249
00:19:27,761 --> 00:19:30,395
Ask me that again, only slower.

250
00:19:30,396 --> 00:19:31,264
You're a pig.

251
00:19:31,265 --> 00:19:34,249
Guess how we're
slowing down cognition.

252
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:35,044
I don't know.

253
00:19:35,045 --> 00:19:38,563
The hair dye.

254
00:19:38,564 --> 00:19:40,318
Dumb blonde. Very artistic.

255
00:19:40,319 --> 00:19:44,723
Works its way into the blood,
through the scalp. Very gradual.

256
00:19:44,724 --> 00:19:48,029
Chem department keeps their end up.

257
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:49,748
I'll see it when I believe it.

258
00:19:49,749 --> 00:19:51,361
Control?
- Yeah, go ahead.

259
00:19:51,362 --> 00:19:53,665
I have the harbinger on line two.

260
00:19:53,666 --> 00:19:57,058
Oh, Christ. Can you take a message?

261
00:19:57,059 --> 00:20:00,777
I don't think so. He's really pushy.

262
00:20:02,272 --> 00:20:04,699
To be honest,
he's kind of freaking me out.

263
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:06,456
Okay. Put him on.

264
00:20:06,457 --> 00:20:10,166
Mordecai, baby, what's happening?
How's the weather up top?

265
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:14,561
The lambs have passed through the gate.
They are come to the killing floor.

266
00:20:14,562 --> 00:20:16,841
Well, you're doing
a great job out there.

267
00:20:16,842 --> 00:20:20,112
By the numbers, man.
You got us started off just right.

268
00:20:20,113 --> 00:20:21,833
So, we'll talk to you later, okay?

269
00:20:21,834 --> 00:20:25,273
Their blind eyes see nothing
of the horrors to come.

270
00:20:25,274 --> 00:20:27,339
Their ears are stopped.

271
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:29,514
They are the gods' fools.

272
00:20:29,515 --> 00:20:32,748
Well, that's.. how it works.

273
00:20:32,749 --> 00:20:36,699
Cleanse them. Cleanse the
world of their ignorance and sin.

274
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:39,291
Bathe them in the crimson of..

275
00:20:39,292 --> 00:20:41,488
Am I on speakerphone?

276
00:20:41,489 --> 00:20:44,905
No. Absolutely not.

277
00:20:44,906 --> 00:20:46,888
Speakerphone, no.
No, I wouldn't do that.

278
00:20:46,889 --> 00:20:49,012
Yes, I am. I can hear the echo.

279
00:20:49,013 --> 00:20:52,578
Oh, my God. You're right.
Hang on one second, I'll take you off.

280
00:20:52,579 --> 00:20:55,420
That's rude.
I don't know who's in the room.

281
00:20:55,421 --> 00:20:58,406
Fine. There. You're off.

282
00:20:58,407 --> 00:20:59,556
Thank you.

283
00:20:59,557 --> 00:21:01,775
Don't take this lightly, boy.

284
00:21:01,776 --> 00:21:04,571
It wasn't all by your numbers.

285
00:21:04,572 --> 00:21:09,279
The fool nearly derailed
the invocation with his insolence.

286
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,043
The ancient ones see everything.

287
00:21:12,044 --> 00:21:13,558
And they will not be..

288
00:21:13,559 --> 00:21:16,257
I'm still on speakerphone, aren't I?

289
00:21:16,258 --> 00:21:20,473
Oh, my God. Mordecai.

290
00:21:20,474 --> 00:21:23,237
I can't believe it. I did it again!

291
00:21:23,238 --> 00:21:24,483
Mordy?

292
00:21:24,484 --> 00:21:27,245
What happens next?

293
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:36,496
Oh! That's cold!

294
00:21:37,991 --> 00:21:40,958
How cold? Is it worth it?

295
00:21:40,959 --> 00:21:43,602
Come on, Jules. Life is risk.

296
00:21:43,603 --> 00:21:46,842
Yeah, I might just risk
lying out in the sun for a while.

297
00:21:46,843 --> 00:21:48,128
Boo.

298
00:21:48,129 --> 00:21:50,207
Hey, what is that?
- What?

299
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:51,645
In the lake, right there.

300
00:21:51,646 --> 00:21:53,679
Oh, come on. - No you guys,
I'm serious. Right there.

301
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:56,499
There! There!
God, looks just like my girlfriend!

302
00:21:59,171 --> 00:22:00,404
Oh, my God!

303
00:22:00,405 --> 00:22:02,117
There's something else in the lake!

304
00:22:02,118 --> 00:22:06,848
It's a gorgeous man!
- I'm gonna kill you!

305
00:22:06,849 --> 00:22:09,302
Don't kill the gorgeous man!
We're endangered!

306
00:22:15,687 --> 00:22:17,726
All right. Last chance.

307
00:22:17,727 --> 00:22:22,591
It's post time. Dig deep, people.
Betting windows are closing. Okay.

308
00:22:22,592 --> 00:22:23,477
Okay, who's still out?

309
00:22:23,478 --> 00:22:27,941
Let's see. We got engineering,
we got R & D, and we got electrical.

310
00:22:27,942 --> 00:22:29,491
Did you see who they picked?

311
00:22:29,492 --> 00:22:30,861
They're practically
giving their money away.

312
00:22:30,862 --> 00:22:32,901
You should talk, Aquaman.

313
00:22:32,902 --> 00:22:35,160
What do you mean?
- Ah, nothing.

314
00:22:36,451 --> 00:22:37,453
Okay, all right.

315
00:22:37,454 --> 00:22:39,836
I'm not even sure
we have one of these.

316
00:22:39,837 --> 00:22:41,110
Zoology swears we do.

317
00:22:41,111 --> 00:22:44,192
They'd know. Okay. All right, people.

318
00:22:44,193 --> 00:22:45,346
Hey, what do you got?

319
00:22:45,347 --> 00:22:47,619
No, they've already been picked.

320
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:49,470
What? No. Who took them?

321
00:22:49,471 --> 00:22:50,484
Maintenance.

322
00:22:50,485 --> 00:22:52,475
Maintenance?
They pick the same thing every year.

323
00:22:52,476 --> 00:22:53,541
What do you want from me?

324
00:22:53,542 --> 00:22:55,147
If they were creative,
they wouldn't be in maintenance.

325
00:22:55,148 --> 00:22:57,273
You're gonna have to split
this if you win. You wanna switch?

326
00:22:57,274 --> 00:23:01,971
I don't know, I don't know.
What do you think?

327
00:23:01,972 --> 00:23:04,963
More than anything,
I just want this moment to end.

328
00:23:08,836 --> 00:23:10,574
Not betting?

329
00:23:10,575 --> 00:23:11,875
Not for me. Thanks.

330
00:23:13,226 --> 00:23:15,210
Seems a little harsh, doesn't it?

331
00:23:15,211 --> 00:23:17,737
It's just people letting off steam.

332
00:23:19,687 --> 00:23:22,875
This job isn't easy,
however those clowns may behave.

333
00:23:22,876 --> 00:23:27,330
Does the director.
Do they know about this downstairs?

334
00:23:27,331 --> 00:23:28,704
The director doesn't
care about this stuff.

335
00:23:28,705 --> 00:23:30,484
As long as everything
goes smoothly upstairs..

336
00:23:30,485 --> 00:23:32,429
as long as the kids
do as they're told.

337
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:33,813
But then it's fixed.

338
00:23:33,814 --> 00:23:35,522
No, no, no.

339
00:23:35,523 --> 00:23:38,776
How can you wager on this
when you control the outcome?

340
00:23:38,777 --> 00:23:41,548
No, we just get 'em in the cellar.
They take it from there.

341
00:23:41,549 --> 00:23:43,748
No, they have to make the
choice of their own free will.

342
00:23:43,749 --> 00:23:45,649
Otherwise the system doesn't work.

343
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:47,610
It's like the harbinger.

344
00:23:47,611 --> 00:23:52,312
It's this creepy old fuck, practically
wears a sign, "You will die."

345
00:23:52,313 --> 00:23:54,322
Why do we put him there? The system.

346
00:23:54,323 --> 00:23:56,842
They have to choose to ignore him..

347
00:23:56,843 --> 00:23:59,191
and they have to choose
what happens in the cellar.

348
00:23:59,192 --> 00:24:01,197
Yeah, we rig the game
as much as we need to..

349
00:24:01,198 --> 00:24:03,369
but in the end,
they don't transgress..

350
00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:04,669
hey can't be punished.

351
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:08,363
So what's it gonna be, Truman?
You in? Window's closing.

352
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,285
I'm fine.

353
00:24:13,646 --> 00:24:15,529
Okay.

354
00:24:15,530 --> 00:24:17,025
That's it, gang!

355
00:24:17,026 --> 00:24:18,622
The board is locked!

356
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:21,011
Oh, let's get this party started!

357
00:24:21,012 --> 00:24:23,509
Let's get this party started!

358
00:24:35,050 --> 00:24:35,850
There you go.

359
00:24:35,851 --> 00:24:37,875
Okay, my turn.

360
00:24:37,876 --> 00:24:39,029
Jules.

361
00:24:41,753 --> 00:24:43,805
Truth or dare?

362
00:24:43,806 --> 00:24:44,996
Let's go dare.

363
00:24:45,271 --> 00:24:46,319
All right.

364
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:50,226
I dare you to make out with..

365
00:24:50,227 --> 00:24:52,130
Please say "Dana," please say "Dana."

366
00:24:52,131 --> 00:24:53,897
That moose, over there.

367
00:24:55,468 --> 00:24:56,996
Marty..

368
00:24:56,997 --> 00:24:59,748
have you ever seen a moose before?

369
00:25:01,452 --> 00:25:04,029
Whatever that mysterious beast is.

370
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:05,600
That's a wolf.

371
00:25:06,997 --> 00:25:09,719
I'm living in a womb of reefer,
leave me alone.

372
00:25:10,935 --> 00:25:11,803
Jules..

373
00:25:11,804 --> 00:25:14,690
I dare you to make out with that wolf.

374
00:25:15,843 --> 00:25:16,946
No problem.

375
00:25:42,053 --> 00:25:43,214
Who?

376
00:25:43,215 --> 00:25:45,186
Me?

377
00:25:45,691 --> 00:25:47,878
Well, yes, I am new in town.

378
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:49,898
How did you know?

379
00:25:49,899 --> 00:25:54,152
Oh, my God.
That is so sweet of you to say.

380
00:25:54,153 --> 00:25:56,115
I just colored it, in fact.

381
00:25:56,116 --> 00:25:57,519
No, no, no.

382
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,915
There's no need to huff and puff.

383
00:25:59,916 --> 00:26:03,112
I'll let you come in.

384
00:26:37,213 --> 00:26:39,731
Thank you.

385
00:26:43,607 --> 00:26:44,385
Yeah.

386
00:26:50,906 --> 00:26:52,887
Now,...

387
00:26:52,888 --> 00:26:53,937
Dana.

388
00:26:53,938 --> 00:26:54,919
Truth.

389
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:57,768
What's that supposed to mean?

390
00:26:57,769 --> 00:26:59,309
I'm just skipping ahead.

391
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:01,428
You're gonna say dare.

392
00:27:01,429 --> 00:27:03,180
She's gonna dare you to
do something you don't like..

393
00:27:03,181 --> 00:27:07,443
and then you'll puss out and
say that you wanted truth all along.

394
00:27:07,444 --> 00:27:09,010
Really?

395
00:27:10,383 --> 00:27:12,167
Okay, Jules.

396
00:27:12,168 --> 00:27:14,037
Dare.

397
00:27:15,434 --> 00:27:16,306
What the hell was that?

398
00:27:17,538 --> 00:27:18,356
It's the cellar door.

399
00:27:19,399 --> 00:27:21,480
The wind must've blown it open.

400
00:27:22,346 --> 00:27:24,421
That makes what kinda sense?

401
00:27:24,422 --> 00:27:26,158
What do you think is down there?

402
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:32,024
Why don't we find out?

403
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:35,662
Dana.

404
00:27:37,143 --> 00:27:38,414
I dare you.

405
00:27:54,253 --> 00:27:57,170
How long do I have to stay down here?

406
00:27:57,171 --> 00:27:59,375
Oh, you know, just 'til morning.

407
00:28:34,765 --> 00:28:35,693
Dana.

408
00:28:36,471 --> 00:28:38,958
You okay?

409
00:28:38,959 --> 00:28:40,395
Yeah.

410
00:28:42,978 --> 00:28:44,906
Sorry, I just scared myself.

411
00:28:44,907 --> 00:28:47,310
Well, you called for help.
That voids the dare.

412
00:28:47,311 --> 00:28:49,047
Take your top off.

413
00:28:49,048 --> 00:28:50,519
What?

414
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,347
I don't make up the rules.

415
00:28:54,061 --> 00:28:55,817
Oh, my God.

416
00:28:58,648 --> 00:29:00,911
Look at all this.

417
00:29:03,417 --> 00:29:06,080
Guys..

418
00:29:06,081 --> 00:29:10,866
I'm not sure it's
awesome to be down here.

419
00:29:10,867 --> 00:29:12,859
Guys?

420
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:17,835
Dude, seriously,
your cousin is into some weird shit.

421
00:29:17,836 --> 00:29:20,580
I'm pretty sure this ain't his.

422
00:29:20,581 --> 00:29:24,508
Maybe it was the people
who put in that mirror thing.

423
00:29:29,488 --> 00:29:30,740
Some of this stuff looks really old.

424
00:29:30,741 --> 00:29:32,692
It's beautiful.

425
00:29:37,297 --> 00:29:39,303
Maybe we should go back upstairs.

426
00:29:42,921 --> 00:29:45,997
I dare you all to go upstairs.

427
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:41,191
Guys?

428
00:30:42,956 --> 00:30:44,396
Guys, listen to this.

429
00:30:44,397 --> 00:30:46,950
"April fourth.

430
00:30:46,951 --> 00:30:51,208
"Father was cross with me
and said I lacked the true faith.

431
00:30:51,209 --> 00:30:54,171
"I wish I could prove my devotion..

432
00:30:54,172 --> 00:30:56,726
"as Judah and Matthew
proved on those travelers."

433
00:30:56,727 --> 00:30:57,707
What is that?

434
00:30:57,708 --> 00:31:04,091
Diary of Anna Patience Buckner, 1903.

435
00:31:04,092 --> 00:31:07,664
"Mama screamed most of the night.

436
00:31:07,665 --> 00:31:10,290
"I prayed that she might find faith..

437
00:31:10,291 --> 00:31:13,210
"but she only stopped
when Papa cut her belly..

438
00:31:13,211 --> 00:31:14,707
"and stuffed the coals in.

439
00:31:14,708 --> 00:31:17,116
"Judah told me in my dream..

440
00:31:17,117 --> 00:31:21,288
"that Matthew took him to the
black room, so I know he is killed.

441
00:31:21,289 --> 00:31:26,441
"I want to understand the
glory of the pain like Matthew..

442
00:31:26,442 --> 00:31:32,711
"but cutting the flesh makes
him have a husband's bulge..

443
00:31:32,712 --> 00:31:34,577
"and I do not get like that."

444
00:31:34,578 --> 00:31:37,186
- Jesus. Can we not?
- No. Go on.

445
00:31:37,187 --> 00:31:38,537
- Why?
-I want to know.

446
00:31:38,538 --> 00:31:40,155
"I have found it..

447
00:31:40,156 --> 00:31:44,674
"in the oldest books,
the way of saving our family.

448
00:31:44,675 --> 00:31:47,536
"My good arm is hacked up..

449
00:31:47,537 --> 00:31:50,754
"and et,
so I hope this will be readable.

450
00:31:50,755 --> 00:31:55,398
"That a believer will come
and speak this to our spirits.

451
00:31:55,399 --> 00:31:59,303
"Then we will be restored
and the great pain will return."

452
00:31:59,304 --> 00:32:03,735
And then there's something in Latin.

453
00:32:03,736 --> 00:32:07,307
Okay, I'm drawing a line
in the fucking sand, here.

454
00:32:07,308 --> 00:32:08,769
Do not read the Latin.

455
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:12,740
What the fuck?

456
00:32:12,741 --> 00:32:15,842
- Dolor..
- No, no.

457
00:32:15,843 --> 00:32:18,177
- Stop being a fucking baby.
- Curt!

458
00:32:18,178 --> 00:32:19,088
It's a diary.

459
00:32:19,089 --> 00:32:21,100
It doesn't even mean anything.

460
00:32:21,101 --> 00:32:24,915
- Dana!
- "Dolor supervivo caro.

461
00:32:24,916 --> 00:32:29,617
"Dolor sublimis caro.

462
00:32:29,618 --> 00:32:34,242
"Dolor ignio annivos."

463
00:33:05,119 --> 00:33:06,322
We have a winner!

464
00:33:06,323 --> 00:33:08,773
It's the Buckners,
ladies and gentlemen!

465
00:33:08,774 --> 00:33:11,349
The Buckners pull a 'W'.

466
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:17,794
All right. That means that
congratulations go to Maintenance!

467
00:33:17,795 --> 00:33:21,601
Who share the pot
with Ronald the intern.

468
00:33:21,602 --> 00:33:22,478
Yeah!

469
00:33:22,479 --> 00:33:24,481
That's not fair. I had zombies, too.

470
00:33:24,482 --> 00:33:26,561
Yes, you did. You had zombies.

471
00:33:26,562 --> 00:33:29,988
But this is
"Zombie Redneck Torture Family," see?

472
00:33:29,989 --> 00:33:31,923
They're entirely separate species.

473
00:33:31,924 --> 00:33:34,742
Like the difference between
an elephant and an elephant seal.

474
00:33:34,743 --> 00:33:37,430
There's always next year.

475
00:33:38,224 --> 00:33:40,848
They're like something
from a nightmare.

476
00:33:40,849 --> 00:33:44,956
No. They're something
nightmares are from.

477
00:33:44,957 --> 00:33:49,156
Everything in our stable
is remnant of the old world..

478
00:33:49,157 --> 00:33:53,046
courtesy of you-know-who.

479
00:33:53,047 --> 00:33:55,321
Monsters. Magic.

480
00:33:55,322 --> 00:33:56,767
Gods.

481
00:33:56,768 --> 00:33:58,562
You get used to it.

482
00:33:59,951 --> 00:34:01,166
Should you?

483
00:34:11,144 --> 00:34:12,838
Oh, man. I'm sorry.

484
00:34:12,839 --> 00:34:14,959
- He had the conch in his hands.
- I know.

485
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,993
A couple more minutes,
who knows what might've happened?

486
00:34:16,994 --> 00:34:20,246
I am never gonna see a merman. Ever.

487
00:34:20,247 --> 00:34:21,528
Dude, be thankful.

488
00:34:21,529 --> 00:34:23,116
Those things are terrifying.

489
00:34:23,117 --> 00:34:25,588
And the cleanup on
them is a nightmare.

490
00:34:25,589 --> 00:34:30,305
So, the Buckners.

491
00:34:30,306 --> 00:34:34,107
Yeah, well, they may be zombified,
pain-worshipping, backwoods idiots..

492
00:34:34,108 --> 00:34:37,622
But they're our zombified,
pain-worshipping, backwoods idiots.

493
00:34:37,623 --> 00:34:39,820
With a hundred percent clearance rate.

494
00:34:39,821 --> 00:34:41,544
True. So should we call Japan?

495
00:34:42,671 --> 00:34:44,468
Tell them to take the
rest of the weekend off?

496
00:34:44,469 --> 00:34:47,409
Yeah, right. They're Japanese.
What are they gonna do? Relax?

497
00:34:47,410 --> 00:34:49,929
I'd just like to see them
fall on their asses, for once.

498
00:34:49,930 --> 00:34:50,959
Oh, God, don't even joke.

499
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,803
Every other branch has air-balled.

500
00:34:52,804 --> 00:34:56,920
We need the Japanese crew to get it
done. There's too much riding on this.

501
00:35:38,935 --> 00:35:40,282
Fuck, yeah, baby.

502
00:35:41,315 --> 00:35:42,673
This is so classy.

503
00:35:42,674 --> 00:35:44,950
Come on, like you wouldn't
want a piece of that.

504
00:35:44,951 --> 00:35:48,413
Can we not talk about people
in pieces any more tonight?

505
00:35:48,414 --> 00:35:52,365
Are you feeling lonely, Marty?

506
00:35:54,696 --> 00:35:58,128
Marty and I were sweeties
in our freshman hall.

507
00:35:58,129 --> 00:36:00,420
We made out once.

508
00:36:01,770 --> 00:36:03,456
I never did buy that ring.

509
00:36:03,457 --> 00:36:05,354
But we're still..

510
00:36:07,577 --> 00:36:08,986
close.

511
00:36:14,072 --> 00:36:16,101
I have a theory about all this.

512
00:36:16,102 --> 00:36:18,028
That's our cue to bail.

513
00:36:18,029 --> 00:36:21,868
Tommy Chong here has a theory.
Come on, baby.

514
00:36:21,869 --> 00:36:25,565
Don't worry,
you can tell it to Egghead, here..

515
00:36:25,566 --> 00:36:27,748
if he's not too busy
devirginizing Dana.

516
00:36:27,749 --> 00:36:30,795
Jules, do you wanna go lie down?

517
00:36:30,796 --> 00:36:34,442
That's exactly the point.
Come on. Mush. Mush.

518
00:36:34,443 --> 00:36:35,491
Don't push me around.

519
00:36:35,492 --> 00:36:36,905
Not around, baby. Straight line.

520
00:36:58,559 --> 00:37:01,527
You seriously believe
nothing weird is going on?

521
00:37:02,839 --> 00:37:03,853
Conspiracy?

522
00:37:04,936 --> 00:37:06,780
The way everybody's acting.

523
00:37:06,781 --> 00:37:10,138
Why is Jules suddenly a celebu-tard?

524
00:37:10,139 --> 00:37:14,715
And since when does Curt
pull this alpha-male bullshit?

525
00:37:14,716 --> 00:37:17,914
I mean, he's a sociology major.

526
00:37:17,915 --> 00:37:20,083
He's on full academic scholarship..

527
00:37:20,084 --> 00:37:22,894
and now he's calling
his friend an egghead?

528
00:37:22,895 --> 00:37:24,661
Curt's just drunk.

529
00:37:24,662 --> 00:37:26,928
I've seen Curt drunk.

530
00:37:28,027 --> 00:37:29,752
Jules, too.

531
00:37:29,753 --> 00:37:31,882
Well, then, maybe it's something else.

532
00:37:35,432 --> 00:37:36,926
You're not seeing
what you don't wanna see.

533
00:37:39,206 --> 00:37:41,059
Puppeteers.

534
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:43,242
Puppeteers?

535
00:37:43,243 --> 00:37:44,414
Pop-Tarts?

536
00:37:44,415 --> 00:37:45,851
Did you say you have Pop-Tarts?

537
00:37:45,852 --> 00:37:49,664
Marty, I love you,
but you're really high.

538
00:37:51,056 --> 00:37:55,380
We are not who we are.

539
00:37:58,812 --> 00:38:02,168
I'm gonna go read
a book with pictures.

540
00:38:02,169 --> 00:38:06,490
Thank you.
- "The pain outlives the flesh.

541
00:38:06,491 --> 00:38:10,642
"The flesh returns.. "
or "has a meeting place."

542
00:38:10,643 --> 00:38:11,786
What is that?

543
00:38:11,787 --> 00:38:14,705
The Latin that you
read in the basement.

544
00:38:14,706 --> 00:38:15,464
You speak Latin?

545
00:38:15,465 --> 00:38:19,651
Not well. Not since tenth grade.

546
00:38:19,652 --> 00:38:22,134
Weird how it all comes back.

547
00:38:22,135 --> 00:38:24,722
Well, it's a weird kind of night.

548
00:38:26,156 --> 00:38:27,622
I'm sorry about tonight.

549
00:38:27,623 --> 00:38:29,316
Everybody..

550
00:38:29,317 --> 00:38:33,271
Do I lose points if I tell
you I'm having a pretty nice time?

551
00:38:33,272 --> 00:38:38,294
No. You can tell me that.

552
00:38:44,175 --> 00:38:46,157
What are you running away for?

553
00:38:53,090 --> 00:38:54,906
Don't spill on me!

554
00:38:54,907 --> 00:38:56,432
Did I get a little beer on your shirt?

555
00:38:59,322 --> 00:39:00,722
I guess it'll have to come off, huh?

556
00:39:02,237 --> 00:39:04,434
Not here.

557
00:39:06,029 --> 00:39:06,930
Baby, come on.

558
00:39:06,931 --> 00:39:08,919
We're all alone.

559
00:39:19,641 --> 00:39:20,579
I'm chilly.

560
00:39:21,978 --> 00:39:25,787
Okay, guys. That's it.
Let's go. We've got a job to do.

561
00:39:25,788 --> 00:39:28,696
Your basic human needs disgust me.
Get out of here.

562
00:39:28,697 --> 00:39:31,088
- Do we have temperature
control in this sector? - On it.

563
00:39:34,575 --> 00:39:39,004
Engaging pheromone mists.

564
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:07,247
It's so dark.

565
00:40:07,248 --> 00:40:08,672
Take me inside?

566
00:40:08,673 --> 00:40:10,320
Come on. This is why we came here.

567
00:40:10,321 --> 00:40:14,045
It's romantic.

568
00:40:31,072 --> 00:40:35,563
Okay, baby. Let's see some boobies.

569
00:40:35,564 --> 00:40:37,416
Show us the goods.

570
00:40:39,090 --> 00:40:41,218
Does it really matter if we see her..

571
00:40:41,219 --> 00:40:42,248
We're not the only ones watching, kid.

572
00:40:42,249 --> 00:40:44,465
Gotta keep the customer satisfied.

573
00:40:45,589 --> 00:40:48,643
You understand what's at stake, here?

574
00:41:32,418 --> 00:41:33,478
Score.

575
00:42:06,268 --> 00:42:07,523
Jules!

576
00:43:24,139 --> 00:43:26,150
This we offer in humility and fear.

577
00:43:27,388 --> 00:43:29,945
For the blessed peace
of your eternal slumber.

578
00:43:29,946 --> 00:43:32,162
As it ever was.

579
00:43:32,163 --> 00:43:33,280
As it ever was.

580
00:44:24,086 --> 00:44:28,174
Nemo, man, you gotta wake up.
Your shit is topsy-turvy.

581
00:44:31,355 --> 00:44:33,095
I'm gonna go for a walk.

582
00:44:33,096 --> 00:44:36,571
Okay. I swear to fucking God,
somebody is talking.

583
00:44:41,829 --> 00:44:44,308
Or I'm pretty sure someone is.

584
00:44:44,309 --> 00:44:47,299
I'm gonna go for a walk.

585
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:49,063
Enough!

586
00:44:49,064 --> 00:44:50,950
What are you saying?

587
00:44:50,951 --> 00:44:53,381
What do you want?

588
00:44:55,178 --> 00:44:57,987
You think I'm a puppet, huh?

589
00:44:57,988 --> 00:45:00,622
You think I'm a puppet.
Gonna do a little..

590
00:45:00,623 --> 00:45:03,326
fucking puppet dance!

591
00:45:03,327 --> 00:45:06,393
I'm the boss of my own brain,
so give it up.

592
00:45:06,394 --> 00:45:12,522
I'm gonna go for a walk.

593
00:45:23,939 --> 00:45:24,895
I don't wanna..

594
00:45:24,896 --> 00:45:26,519
I mean, I've never..

595
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:30,261
I don't mean "never"..

596
00:45:30,262 --> 00:45:31,158
Hey.

597
00:45:31,159 --> 00:45:33,357
Nothing you don't want.

598
00:45:37,698 --> 00:45:39,756
He's got a husband bulge.

599
00:45:58,539 --> 00:46:00,246
I thought there'd be stars.

600
00:46:04,910 --> 00:46:06,557
We are abandoned.

601
00:46:33,311 --> 00:46:34,770
- Fuck!
- Fucking run!

602
00:46:34,771 --> 00:46:35,711
Curt!

603
00:46:37,644 --> 00:46:38,716
Dead bitch!

604
00:46:43,094 --> 00:46:44,850
Jesus, what happened?

605
00:46:45,051 --> 00:46:45,805
The fuck!

606
00:46:45,806 --> 00:46:47,231
Curt, what the fuck?

607
00:46:47,232 --> 00:46:48,376
Where are you hurt?

608
00:46:48,377 --> 00:46:49,770
Is all of this from you?

609
00:46:49,771 --> 00:46:51,766
It's okay! Curt, you're okay!

610
00:46:51,980 --> 00:46:53,095
Where's Jules?

611
00:46:54,738 --> 00:46:57,784
She's gone.

612
00:46:58,957 --> 00:47:01,483
We've gotta get out of here.

613
00:47:01,484 --> 00:47:04,120
No. No.

614
00:47:04,121 --> 00:47:05,063
Dana, don't open that..

615
00:47:05,064 --> 00:47:06,552
I'm not leaving here without Jules.

616
00:47:06,553 --> 00:47:08,189
That dead girl's out there!

617
00:47:31,686 --> 00:47:32,794
Dana, come on!

618
00:47:37,672 --> 00:47:38,611
What is that thing?

619
00:47:38,612 --> 00:47:39,773
Fuck!

620
00:47:39,774 --> 00:47:41,129
I don't know,
but there's more of them.

621
00:47:41,130 --> 00:47:42,162
More of them?

622
00:47:42,163 --> 00:47:43,948
I saw a young girl.

623
00:47:43,949 --> 00:47:45,719
All zombied like him..

624
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:47,741
but she was missing an arm.

625
00:47:47,742 --> 00:47:51,437
Oh, my God. Patience.

626
00:47:51,438 --> 00:47:53,345
The diary.

627
00:47:53,346 --> 00:47:55,955
- We gotta lock this place down.
-He's right.

628
00:47:55,956 --> 00:47:59,143
We'll go room by room.
Barricade every window and door.

629
00:47:59,144 --> 00:48:03,013
We gotta play it safe. No matter what
happens, we have to stay together.

630
00:48:03,014 --> 00:48:05,768
Fuck!

631
00:48:05,769 --> 00:48:06,756
Calm down.

632
00:48:06,757 --> 00:48:09,035
Watch the master work.

633
00:48:19,895 --> 00:48:21,241
This isn't right.

634
00:48:21,242 --> 00:48:22,941
What? What's the matter?

635
00:48:22,942 --> 00:48:26,572
This isn't right. We should split up.

636
00:48:26,573 --> 00:48:29,507
We can cover more ground that way.

637
00:48:29,508 --> 00:48:30,990
Yeah.

638
00:48:32,461 --> 00:48:33,964
Yeah. Good idea.

639
00:48:34,961 --> 00:48:36,350
Really?

640
00:48:38,552 --> 00:48:39,992
All right,
you guys, get in your rooms.

641
00:48:44,001 --> 00:48:45,253
Lock them in.

642
00:48:51,451 --> 00:48:54,104
What the fuck?

643
00:49:06,822 --> 00:49:08,301
What the..?

644
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:18,804
What the fuck?

645
00:49:18,805 --> 00:49:20,449
That's not good.

646
00:49:20,450 --> 00:49:22,412
Out of the way. Out of the way.
Out of the way.

647
00:49:22,413 --> 00:49:25,558
Chem department,
I need 500 CCs of Thorazine..

648
00:49:25,559 --> 00:49:26,869
pumped into room three.

649
00:49:26,870 --> 00:49:27,948
No, no, no.

650
00:49:27,949 --> 00:49:29,048
Stand by, Chem.

651
00:49:29,049 --> 00:49:32,318
Judah Buckner to the rescue.

652
00:49:35,803 --> 00:49:36,925
What the fuck?

653
00:49:39,808 --> 00:49:41,690
Fuck! What the fuck?

654
00:49:45,540 --> 00:49:47,497
Oh, my God.

655
00:49:47,940 --> 00:49:51,624
I'm on a reality TV show.

656
00:49:54,737 --> 00:49:58,319
My parents are gonna
think I'm such a burnout.

657
00:50:45,575 --> 00:50:49,762
Help me! Help me!

658
00:51:15,828 --> 00:51:17,830
Must be getting excited downstairs.

659
00:51:18,294 --> 00:51:19,891
Greatest show on Earth.

660
00:51:37,722 --> 00:51:38,753
Somebody help!

661
00:51:41,072 --> 00:51:42,674
Come on!

662
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:54,415
Use the bed!
- Come on! Come on!

663
00:52:09,772 --> 00:52:12,140
It's empty.
- Go.

664
00:52:14,770 --> 00:52:16,375
Curt?
- Unlock the door.

665
00:52:16,277 --> 00:52:18,507
I can't. Get down to the basement.

666
00:52:36,811 --> 00:52:38,128
This is the black room.

667
00:52:38,129 --> 00:52:39,816
Nice.

668
00:52:42,926 --> 00:52:43,966
From the diary.

669
00:52:46,035 --> 00:52:47,938
This is where he killed them.

670
00:52:50,614 --> 00:52:51,954
This is where he kills us.

671
00:52:51,955 --> 00:52:54,013
No way. No.

672
00:52:54,014 --> 00:52:55,709
He's not gonna kill us

673
00:52:55,711 --> 00:52:57,811
We just gotta find a door.

674
00:52:57,812 --> 00:52:59,426
Okay?

675
00:53:03,017 --> 00:53:04,762
Let's just check the walls, okay?

676
00:53:05,943 --> 00:53:07,330
Curt?

677
00:53:07,331 --> 00:53:09,234
I mean, there's gotta be..

678
00:53:25,889 --> 00:53:27,553
You like pain?

679
00:53:31,741 --> 00:53:33,151
How's that work for you?

680
00:53:56,801 --> 00:53:58,612
These fucking zombies.

681
00:53:58,613 --> 00:54:01,135
Remember when you could
just throw a girl in a volcano?

682
00:54:01,136 --> 00:54:02,455
How old do you think I am?

683
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:13,285
Let's move! Come on! Come on! Go!

684
00:54:26,033 --> 00:54:27,135
What about Marty?

685
00:54:27,136 --> 00:54:28,377
They got him.

686
00:55:03,910 --> 00:55:06,300
The devil is defeated.

687
00:55:06,301 --> 00:55:09,801
Now Kiko's spirit will
live in the happy frog!

688
00:55:18,948 --> 00:55:20,072
Fuck you!

689
00:55:20,073 --> 00:55:24,050
Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you!

690
00:55:26,716 --> 00:55:28,940
- You seeing this?
- Perfect record, huh?

691
00:55:28,941 --> 00:55:31,975
The Japan crew should've
had this in the bag. They fucked us.

692
00:55:31,976 --> 00:55:33,219
How hard is it to kill nine-year-olds?

693
00:55:33,220 --> 00:55:35,406
Zero fatality. Total wash.

694
00:55:35,407 --> 00:55:39,049
You want good product,
you gotta buy American.

695
00:55:39,050 --> 00:55:41,319
Any word from downstairs?

696
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:44,017
Downstairs doesn't care about Japan.
The director trusts us.

697
00:55:44,018 --> 00:55:45,933
You just sweat the chem, Lin.

698
00:55:45,934 --> 00:55:48,794
While these morons are singing
What a Friend We Have in Shinto..

699
00:55:48,795 --> 00:55:50,858
we are bringing the pain.

700
00:55:50,859 --> 00:55:53,180
Yeah, and what the fuck's
up with this guy's pot, anyway?

701
00:55:53,181 --> 00:55:56,109
He's supposed to be drooling
and instead he almost makes us?

702
00:55:56,110 --> 00:55:57,517
We treated the shit out of it.

703
00:55:57,518 --> 00:55:59,734
Okay, we've got the Rambler
heading toward the tunnel.

704
00:55:59,735 --> 00:56:01,605
The fool's toast anyway.

705
00:56:01,606 --> 00:56:04,549
And so are we if you
don't get this under control.

706
00:56:04,550 --> 00:56:07,333
Shit.
- What? "Shit" why?

707
00:56:07,334 --> 00:56:08,475
Gotta go. Work to do.

708
00:56:08,476 --> 00:56:10,704
You guys are humanity's last hope.
If the ancients rise..

709
00:56:10,705 --> 00:56:13,526
There's no cave-in.
- What?

710
00:56:13,527 --> 00:56:14,999
The fucking tunnel's open!

711
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,818
Control to Demolition.

712
00:56:17,819 --> 00:56:18,847
We're dark on the whole sector.

713
00:56:18,848 --> 00:56:20,077
Try to bypass it.

714
00:56:20,078 --> 00:56:21,901
- What the fuck do you think I'm doing?
-Open the door.

715
00:56:32,093 --> 00:56:34,733
Look out!
Get out of the way! Make a hole!

716
00:56:39,486 --> 00:56:41,610
What the fuck's going on?
- We don't know.

717
00:56:41,611 --> 00:56:43,201
Electrical said there
was a glitch up top.

718
00:56:43,202 --> 00:56:45,419
That tunnel should've blown hours ago.
-We didn't get the order.

719
00:56:58,817 --> 00:56:59,983
Hadley, what is going on?

720
00:56:59,984 --> 00:57:01,937
Hadley?

721
00:57:01,938 --> 00:57:04,309
Why hasn't the tunnel blown?

722
00:57:55,536 --> 00:57:58,945
No, no. No fucking way!

723
00:58:01,333 --> 00:58:03,181
Can't believe this, man.
This ain't happening.

724
00:58:03,182 --> 00:58:06,977
It's right there.

725
00:58:06,978 --> 00:58:09,472
All right.
We got any climbing gear? Ropes?

726
00:58:09,473 --> 00:58:11,678
Yeah. In my fucking dorm room.

727
00:58:11,679 --> 00:58:13,317
We can't go back.

728
00:58:13,318 --> 00:58:15,190
There's no way across.

729
00:58:15,191 --> 00:58:16,800
What're we gonna do? Jump?

730
00:58:16,801 --> 00:58:18,835
Dude.

731
00:58:20,039 --> 00:58:21,409
What?

732
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:29,191
Curt, are you sure about this?

733
00:58:29,192 --> 00:58:30,481
I've done bigger jumps than this.

734
00:58:30,482 --> 00:58:31,895
You've got a smooth run..

735
00:58:31,896 --> 00:58:34,224
and maybe a five foot
differential on the other side.

736
00:58:34,225 --> 00:58:36,105
But you've gotta give it everything.

737
00:58:36,106 --> 00:58:38,102
Curt.

738
00:58:41,483 --> 00:58:43,079
Look, you guys,
you stay in the Rambler.

739
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:44,358
I'll get help.

740
00:58:44,359 --> 00:58:47,610
If I wipe out,
I'll fucking limp for help.

741
00:58:47,611 --> 00:58:49,790
But I'm coming back here.

742
00:58:49,791 --> 00:58:53,098
I'm coming back with
cops and choppers..

743
00:58:53,099 --> 00:58:56,575
and large fucking guns,
and those things are gonna pay.

744
00:58:58,154 --> 00:58:59,898
For Jules.

745
00:59:08,168 --> 00:59:10,348
Don't hold back.

746
00:59:10,349 --> 00:59:13,387
Never do.

747
00:59:38,630 --> 00:59:40,275
No!

748
00:59:42,227 --> 00:59:43,312
Curt!

749
00:59:43,617 --> 00:59:44,524
Oh, God!

750
00:59:49,851 --> 00:59:55,605
He hit something.
There's nothing. What'd he hit?

751
00:59:57,848 --> 00:59:59,038
Puppeteers.

752
01:00:00,514 --> 01:00:02,987
Marty was right.

753
01:00:02,988 --> 01:00:04,846
Get in the van.

754
01:00:07,387 --> 01:00:08,359
Dana.

755
01:00:12,661 --> 01:00:15,756
Marty was right.

756
01:00:34,795 --> 01:00:36,048
You're going back.

757
01:00:36,049 --> 01:00:37,767
I'm going through.

758
01:00:37,768 --> 01:00:41,296
And we'll just drive.
There's gotta be another road.

759
01:00:41,297 --> 01:00:42,874
Another way out of here.
-It won't work.

760
01:00:44,602 --> 01:00:48,413
Something will happen.
It will collapse, it will wash away.

761
01:00:48,414 --> 01:00:50,308
Then we just leave
the roads altogether.

762
01:00:50,309 --> 01:00:55,290
Drive as far as we can into the
forest and we go on foot from there.

763
01:00:56,867 --> 01:00:58,965
You're missing the point.

764
01:00:58,966 --> 01:01:03,613
Please, do not go nuts on me,
okay, Dana? You're all I've got, now.

765
01:01:07,343 --> 01:01:09,048
I'm okay.

766
01:01:09,049 --> 01:01:10,929
Good, okay, 'cause I need you calm.

767
01:01:10,930 --> 01:01:11,931
Okay, no matter what happens,
we gotta stay..

768
01:02:12,236 --> 01:02:14,211
Goddamn, that was close!

769
01:02:14,212 --> 01:02:16,014
Yeah, photo-fucking-finish.

770
01:02:16,015 --> 01:02:17,296
I don't understand.

771
01:02:17,297 --> 01:02:19,044
You're celebrating?

772
01:02:19,045 --> 01:02:22,003
They're celebrating. I'm drinking.

773
01:02:22,004 --> 01:02:23,794
But she's still alive.

774
01:02:23,795 --> 01:02:25,738
How can the ritual be complete?

775
01:02:25,739 --> 01:02:28,269
The virgin's death is optional,
as long as it's last.

776
01:02:28,270 --> 01:02:31,183
Main thing is that she suffers.

777
01:02:31,184 --> 01:02:32,687
That she did.

778
01:02:34,155 --> 01:02:36,206
It's so strange.

779
01:02:37,694 --> 01:02:39,543
I'm actually rooting for this girl.

780
01:02:39,544 --> 01:02:41,716
She's got so much heart.

781
01:02:41,717 --> 01:02:45,480
And you think of
all the pain and the..

782
01:02:45,481 --> 01:02:50,209
Tequila is my lady! My lady!

783
01:02:50,210 --> 01:02:52,879
Come on in, guys!
Come on in. You're welcome.

784
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:56,456
Tequila!
From darkness, there is light!

785
01:04:03,766 --> 01:04:05,604
I wish that I could do what you do.

786
01:04:05,605 --> 01:04:07,843
Oh, my God.
-Yeah, it's masterful.

787
01:04:07,844 --> 01:04:11,325
I don't know.
Tonight was solid. I don't know.

788
01:04:11,326 --> 01:04:14,362
Are you kidding? Classic denouement.
When the van hits the lake..

789
01:04:14,363 --> 01:04:15,233
I screamed.

790
01:04:15,234 --> 01:04:17,783
And the water rushing in,
and the zombies..

791
01:04:17,784 --> 01:04:20,274
just think it would've
been cooler with a merman.

792
01:04:20,275 --> 01:04:22,847
Do you know if we get
the overtime bonus on this one?

793
01:04:22,848 --> 01:04:25,352
Accounting's over there. Ask them.

794
01:04:25,353 --> 01:04:27,890
I don't need to.
I already know the answer.

795
01:04:27,891 --> 01:04:28,913
I'm an intern.

796
01:04:28,914 --> 01:04:33,592
So I don't qualify for OT.

797
01:04:33,593 --> 01:04:35,815
It's funny that you like the ballet..

798
01:04:35,816 --> 01:04:40,481
because I happen to have
two tickets to your favorite..

799
01:04:42,651 --> 01:04:44,407
You knuckleheads.

800
01:04:44,408 --> 01:04:46,693
You almost gave me a
heart attack with that tunnel.

801
01:04:46,694 --> 01:04:49,420
Like I said, it wasn't our fault.
We didn't get the order.

802
01:04:49,421 --> 01:04:51,616
I'm just giving you a hard time.

803
01:04:51,617 --> 01:04:54,827
Come on. Give us a hug.

804
01:04:54,828 --> 01:04:56,999
No, seriously. That wasn't our fault.

805
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,792
There was a glitch.
Power re-route from upstairs.

806
01:05:01,194 --> 01:05:03,403
What do you mean, upstairs?

807
01:05:14,585 --> 01:05:17,878
Turn the fucking music off.

808
01:05:32,749 --> 01:05:33,797
Hello?

809
01:05:33,798 --> 01:05:36,868
That's impossible. Everything
was done within the guidelines.

810
01:05:36,869 --> 01:05:38,522
The virgin's the only one..

811
01:05:38,523 --> 01:05:41,936
No. I am not doubting you.

812
01:05:45,249 --> 01:05:46,278
Which one?

813
01:06:28,419 --> 01:06:30,000
Marty.
-Hi.

814
01:06:36,493 --> 01:06:37,776
Dana, come on.

815
01:07:03,349 --> 01:07:04,699
Marty. Wait.

816
01:07:04,700 --> 01:07:06,107
We're going in the grave?

817
01:07:07,488 --> 01:07:10,524
Dana, come on!

818
01:07:26,748 --> 01:07:27,976
What is this place?

819
01:07:31,352 --> 01:07:37,235
Yeah. I had to dismember
that guy with a trowel.

820
01:07:40,323 --> 01:07:41,808
What have you been up to?

821
01:07:46,358 --> 01:07:48,387
Nobody else, huh?

822
01:07:54,668 --> 01:07:56,383
Yeah, I figured.

823
01:07:57,939 --> 01:08:00,023
You figured everything.

824
01:08:00,024 --> 01:08:01,735
Oh, not at all.

825
01:08:01,736 --> 01:08:05,225
But, I do know some stuff.

826
01:08:05,226 --> 01:08:06,856
As in..

827
01:08:11,293 --> 01:08:14,061
It's an elevator.

828
01:08:14,062 --> 01:08:18,230
Somebody sent those dead
fucks up here to get us.

829
01:08:18,231 --> 01:08:23,522
Now, there's no controls inside, but
there's maintenance overrides in there.

830
01:08:23,523 --> 01:08:26,035
And I think I can get it to go down.

831
01:08:27,297 --> 01:08:28,983
Do we wanna go down?

832
01:08:31,716 --> 01:08:33,501
Where else are we gonna go?

833
01:08:36,891 --> 01:08:40,722
Come on. Get in.

834
01:08:53,463 --> 01:08:54,201
Come on!

835
01:08:54,563 --> 01:08:56,164
Fucking zombie arm.

836
01:08:56,403 --> 01:08:57,924
Oh, shit.

837
01:11:06,706 --> 01:11:08,841
We chose.

838
01:11:08,806 --> 01:11:11,443
What? What?

839
01:11:11,444 --> 01:11:12,302
Fuck!

840
01:11:20,490 --> 01:11:26,133
All that shit we were playing with.

841
01:11:26,134 --> 01:11:28,242
They made us choose.

842
01:11:29,530 --> 01:11:32,462
They made us choose how we die.

843
01:12:11,482 --> 01:12:13,868
We saw them go down the access drop.
They have to be in one of these.

844
01:12:13,869 --> 01:12:15,303
Internal security can..

845
01:12:15,304 --> 01:12:18,777
I don't care if it's not protocol.
Are you fucking high?

846
01:12:18,778 --> 01:12:21,083
It's the fool! Do not touch the girl.

847
01:12:21,084 --> 01:12:23,253
If he outlives her,
this whole thing goes to hell.

848
01:12:23,254 --> 01:12:24,869
Take him out first.

849
01:12:24,870 --> 01:12:27,091
Cleanup says the prep team
missed one of the kid's stashes.

850
01:12:27,092 --> 01:12:30,043
Whatever he's been smoking's
been immunizing him to all our shit.

851
01:12:30,044 --> 01:12:31,636
How does that help us right now? What?

852
01:12:31,637 --> 01:12:34,880
No, if you have a confirmed kill,
take her out, too.

853
01:12:34,881 --> 01:12:35,982
There.

854
01:12:35,983 --> 01:12:37,787
3606.

855
01:12:39,231 --> 01:12:40,313
Gotcha.

856
01:12:40,314 --> 01:12:41,723
Bring 'em down.

857
01:13:00,062 --> 01:13:02,797
Step out of the elevator!
Step out of the elevator!

858
01:13:02,798 --> 01:13:05,885
Why are you trying to kill us?
- Step out! Just the girl!

859
01:13:05,886 --> 01:13:07,309
What? -Just me?

860
01:13:07,310 --> 01:13:08,216
Do it!

861
01:13:19,580 --> 01:13:20,920
Good work, zombie arm.

862
01:13:46,149 --> 01:13:47,509
You shouldn't be here.

863
01:13:50,208 --> 01:13:52,425
This should've gone differently.

864
01:13:52,426 --> 01:13:54,146
Ended more quickly.

865
01:13:54,147 --> 01:13:58,447
I can only imagine
your pain and confusion.

866
01:13:58,448 --> 01:14:00,195
But know this.

867
01:14:00,196 --> 01:14:04,517
What's happening to you
is part of something bigger.

868
01:14:04,518 --> 01:14:06,998
Something older than anything known.

869
01:14:06,999 --> 01:14:11,219
You've seen horrible things.

870
01:14:11,220 --> 01:14:14,056
An army of nightmare creatures.

871
01:14:14,057 --> 01:14:17,402
But they are nothing
compared to what came before.

872
01:14:17,403 --> 01:14:19,747
What lies below.

873
01:14:21,273 --> 01:14:25,226
It's our task to placate
the ancient ones.

874
01:14:26,679 --> 01:14:29,426
As it's yours to
be offered up to them.

875
01:14:30,885 --> 01:14:32,220
Forgive us.

876
01:14:32,221 --> 01:14:34,337
And let us get it over with.

877
01:14:34,338 --> 01:14:37,675
Come on. Go in that room.

878
01:14:59,759 --> 01:15:01,596
Army of nightmares, huh?

879
01:15:10,958 --> 01:15:12,432
Let's get this party started.

880
01:15:14,313 --> 01:15:15,210
Hold fire!

881
01:15:29,899 --> 01:15:31,091
Oh, shit.

882
01:15:46,705 --> 01:15:48,727
Go! Go! Go!

883
01:17:01,391 --> 01:17:03,143
Lead officer Truman
to security command.

884
01:17:03,144 --> 01:17:07,389
Requesting immediate reinforcements.
Code black. I repeat, code black.

885
01:17:07,390 --> 01:17:09,176
Where the fuck are you guys?

886
01:17:09,177 --> 01:17:12,886
Sector 12, down. Sector 8, down.

887
01:17:12,887 --> 01:17:15,510
Sector 3, down. Jesus Christ!

888
01:17:15,511 --> 01:17:17,801
Why aren't the defenses working?
Where's the fucking gas?

889
01:17:17,802 --> 01:17:20,248
Something chewed through the
connections in the utility shaft.

890
01:17:20,493 --> 01:17:22,241
Something which?
- Something scary!

891
01:17:55,741 --> 01:17:57,313
The north exit is blocked.
You can't go there.

892
01:18:20,457 --> 01:18:21,989
Go, go, go!

893
01:19:14,268 --> 01:19:15,230
Fuck! We're running out of time!

894
01:19:15,487 --> 01:19:16,568
It's on lockdown,
I'm trying to bypass.

895
01:19:30,105 --> 01:19:31,980
Hadley!

896
01:20:01,968 --> 01:20:04,374
Oh, come on!

897
01:20:44,622 --> 01:20:45,804
It's you.

898
01:20:48,443 --> 01:20:54,255
No, no, no. Please, please.

899
01:20:58,237 --> 01:20:59,952
Kill him.

900
01:21:08,485 --> 01:21:09,589
Okay, Dana, come on.

901
01:21:09,590 --> 01:21:11,081
Dana.

902
01:21:14,172 --> 01:21:16,658
Here. It's easier with this.

903
01:22:21,100 --> 01:22:22,873
Look at these.

904
01:22:25,605 --> 01:22:27,710
Five of them.

905
01:22:27,711 --> 01:22:29,575
What are they?

906
01:22:32,453 --> 01:22:33,753
Us.

907
01:22:33,754 --> 01:22:36,367
I should have seen it like you did.

908
01:22:38,202 --> 01:22:40,624
This is part of a ritual.

909
01:22:40,625 --> 01:22:43,549
A ritual sacrifice?

910
01:22:45,789 --> 01:22:46,933
Great.

911
01:22:46,934 --> 01:22:53,017
You tie someone to a stone, get a
fancy dagger and a bunch of robes.

912
01:22:53,018 --> 01:22:55,476
Is that that complicated?
- No.

913
01:22:55,477 --> 01:22:56,830
It's simple.

914
01:22:56,831 --> 01:22:59,545
They don't just want to see us killed.

915
01:23:02,422 --> 01:23:04,283
They want to see us punished.

916
01:23:05,644 --> 01:23:06,991
Punished for what?

917
01:23:06,992 --> 01:23:09,465
For being young.

918
01:23:15,248 --> 01:23:18,296
It's different in every culture.

919
01:23:18,297 --> 01:23:20,730
And it has changed over the years..

920
01:23:20,731 --> 01:23:23,779
but it has always required youth.

921
01:23:23,780 --> 01:23:27,107
There must be at least five.

922
01:23:28,322 --> 01:23:30,096
The whore.

923
01:23:30,097 --> 01:23:31,829
She's corrupted.

924
01:23:31,830 --> 01:23:33,470
She dies first.

925
01:23:33,471 --> 01:23:36,449
The athlete.

926
01:23:36,450 --> 01:23:39,653
The scholar.

927
01:23:40,754 --> 01:23:42,611
The fool.

928
01:23:42,612 --> 01:23:46,072
All suffer and die at the hands of..

929
01:23:46,073 --> 01:23:48,552
whatever horror they have raised..

930
01:23:48,553 --> 01:23:52,408
leaving the last, to live or die..

931
01:23:52,409 --> 01:23:54,823
.. as fate decides.

932
01:23:57,020 --> 01:23:58,588
The virgin.

933
01:24:00,112 --> 01:24:01,628
Me?

934
01:24:01,629 --> 01:24:03,686
Virgin?

935
01:24:03,687 --> 01:24:06,094
We work with what we have.

936
01:24:06,095 --> 01:24:08,898
But what if you don't pull it off?

937
01:24:08,899 --> 01:24:09,844
They rise.

938
01:24:09,845 --> 01:24:10,937
Who does?

939
01:24:12,254 --> 01:24:14,304
What's beneath us?

940
01:24:14,305 --> 01:24:15,735
The ancient ones.

941
01:24:15,736 --> 01:24:18,271
The gods that used to rule the Earth.

942
01:24:18,272 --> 01:24:22,461
As long as they accept
our sacrifice, they remain below.

943
01:24:22,462 --> 01:24:25,397
But the other rituals have all failed.

944
01:24:29,086 --> 01:24:30,505
The sun is coming up in eight minutes.

945
01:24:30,506 --> 01:24:33,889
If you live to see it,
the world will end.

946
01:24:33,890 --> 01:24:36,354
Maybe that's the way it should be.

947
01:24:36,355 --> 01:24:39,757
If you've got to kill all
my friends to survive..

948
01:24:39,758 --> 01:24:41,861
maybe it's time for a change.

949
01:24:41,862 --> 01:24:43,861
We're not talking about change.

950
01:24:43,862 --> 01:24:48,986
We're talking about the agonizing death
of every human soul on the planet.

951
01:24:48,987 --> 01:24:50,733
Including you.

952
01:24:50,734 --> 01:24:52,593
You can die with them..

953
01:24:54,481 --> 01:24:56,972
or you can die for them.

954
01:24:59,508 --> 01:25:02,165
Gosh, they're both so enticing.

955
01:25:20,370 --> 01:25:23,272
The whole world, Marty.

956
01:25:23,273 --> 01:25:25,445
Is in your hands, Dana.

957
01:25:25,446 --> 01:25:28,158
There is no other way.

958
01:25:28,159 --> 01:25:31,007
You have to be strong.

959
01:25:31,008 --> 01:25:33,585
Yeah, Dana..

960
01:25:35,923 --> 01:25:37,212
you feeling strong?

961
01:25:39,346 --> 01:25:41,197
I'm sorry.

962
01:25:45,159 --> 01:25:46,232
So am I.

963
01:26:29,340 --> 01:26:30,621
Marty..

964
01:26:35,842 --> 01:26:37,240
Marty!

965
01:27:30,444 --> 01:27:32,670
Hey.

966
01:27:35,901 --> 01:27:37,686
You know..

967
01:27:41,420 --> 01:27:43,698
I don't think Curt even has a cousin.

968
01:27:51,129 --> 01:27:53,184
How are you?

969
01:27:56,816 --> 01:27:58,585
Going away.

970
01:28:03,240 --> 01:28:04,688
I'm sorry.

971
01:28:06,619 --> 01:28:08,777
I'm so sorry I almost shot you.

972
01:28:08,778 --> 01:28:12,050
I probably wouldn't have.

973
01:28:12,051 --> 01:28:13,828
Hey, no. No.

974
01:28:15,729 --> 01:28:16,841
I totally get it.

975
01:28:30,400 --> 01:28:34,987
I'm sorry I let you get attacked by
a werewolf and then ended the world.

976
01:28:36,534 --> 01:28:37,362
No.

977
01:28:38,816 --> 01:28:40,638
Hey, you were right.

978
01:28:42,198 --> 01:28:43,863
Humanity...

979
01:28:50,622 --> 01:28:53,764
It's time to give
someone else a chance.

980
01:29:06,090 --> 01:29:08,327
Giant evil gods.

981
01:29:13,660 --> 01:29:16,509
I wish I could've seen them.

982
01:29:16,510 --> 01:29:17,967
I know.

983
01:29:20,302 --> 01:29:23,361
That would have been a fun weekend.

984
