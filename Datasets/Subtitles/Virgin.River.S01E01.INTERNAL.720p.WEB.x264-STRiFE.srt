Oh.

15
00:01:36,387 --> 00:01:38,137
Well, that looks like a nasty bump.

16
00:01:40,141 --> 00:01:42,141
- How do you feel?
- Not great.

17
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:43,517
I'm not surprised.

18
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:44,903
Word to the wise.

19
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:47,819
That particular patient
always requires restraints.

20
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:49,859
Right. There wasn't a chart.

21
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:51,193
It's your first day, huh?

22
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:52,697
- Yeah.
- Always get the chart.

23
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:53,949
- Okay?
- Yeah.

24
00:01:55,907 --> 00:01:57,787
Don't wanna walk into a situation
totally blind.

25
00:01:57,867 --> 00:01:59,345
- You'll wind up...
- Knocked on my ass?

26
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:01,199
Yeah.

27
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:02,788
Mm.

28
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:06,963
Have a good day.

29
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:12,877
- Oh!
- You need to get out of the car.

30
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:15,046
- What?
- You need to get out of the car, ma'am.

31
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:17,925
- Your vehicle is stuck in the ditch.
- What?

32
00:02:20,348 --> 00:02:21,978
Oh, it's unbelievable.

33
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:25,808
Well, you're lucky you didn't smash
this ridiculous little car into a tree.

34
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:28,396
Thank you for stopping.
I'll just call AAA.

35
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,070
Uh... Look around.

36
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:34,401
You're in a heavily wooded area.
There's no cell reception here.

37
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:36,155
Damn it.

38
00:02:37,782 --> 00:02:40,032
I'll call Bert once we get into town.

39
00:02:40,451 --> 00:02:43,581
If he's not too busy,
maybe you'll get your car back this week.

40
00:02:50,086 --> 00:02:51,086
Are you comin' or not?

41
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:42,215
Um... Could you drop me
at the McCrea cabin?

42
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:44,682
It's in Virgin River.
I've got the address here.

43
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:48,976
Anyone who lives within 50 miles of here
knows the McCrea cabin.

44
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:51,272
Oh. Well, from the photo, it's beautiful.

45
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:01,281
Um...

46
00:04:03,868 --> 00:04:04,868
Here.

47
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:08,224
Folks around here,
we don't pay each other to be neighborly.

48
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:09,748
Just somethin' we do.

49
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,843
Right. I'm sorry.

50
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,336
Thank you.

51
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:24,349
And here we are.

52
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:29,768
Oh, no.

53
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,560
That's a beaut, huh?

54
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:40,609
Oh!
Someone pulled a fast one on you.

55
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:43,947
Never book your vacation online,
they'll scam you every time.

56
00:04:44,033 --> 00:04:46,873
No, I... I'm not on vacation.
I'm here for a job.

57
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:49,247
I'm the new nurse.

58
00:04:49,872 --> 00:04:52,082
I'm... I'm actually a nurse practitioner
and midwife.

59
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:54,126
I'm gonna be working with Dr. Mullins.

60
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:57,450
I heard he's handling the practice alone,
and it's getting to be too much for him.

61
00:04:57,505 --> 00:04:59,024
Oh, is... is that what you heard, huh?

62
00:04:59,048 --> 00:05:00,628
- Okay.
- Yeah. I think he's in his 70s

63
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:01,967
and still working full time.

64
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:03,801
Oh, it's a wonder he's still above ground.

65
00:05:03,886 --> 00:05:05,556
So, old Doc hired ya, huh?

66
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:07,388
Well, Hope McCrea did the actual hiring.

67
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:08,473
Aah.

68
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:10,306
I'm so sorry. I don't know your name.

69
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:12,403
I'm Melinda Monroe. People call me Mel.

70
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:13,728
I'm Vernon.

71
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:15,523
People call me Doc Mullins.

72
00:05:16,607 --> 00:05:17,777
And for the record, missy,

73
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:19,941
I'm 72.

74
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:32,787
Oh. Oh, what is that?

75
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:41,423
Oh!

76
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:44,428
- Hello?
- Hello?

77
00:05:46,387 --> 00:05:47,387
Hi.

78
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:49,681
Melinda!

79
00:05:50,641 --> 00:05:51,931
I'm Hope McCrea.

80
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:54,188
As the mayor of Virgin River,

81
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:57,320
I'd like to officially welcome you
to our little slice of heaven.

82
00:05:57,398 --> 00:05:59,818
Hi, Hope. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I just...

83
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:01,281
I'm a little confused.

84
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:02,736
Um...

85
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:05,318
This is what you sent me.

86
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:08,486
The... "This farmhouse-chic cabin...

87
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:11,997
nestled in the woods
of Northern California

88
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,120
is designed to enjoy
all the trappings of country life?"

89
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:19,378
Like... "Farmhouse-chic" is not
an accurate description of this property.

90
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:22,842
I admit, I... I haven't gotten around
to taking a more current photo.

91
00:06:24,675 --> 00:06:28,635
Okay, well, the job I accepted
included housing for a year.

92
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:30,641
- And I obviously can't stay here.
- Um...

93
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:31,853
I'll have it cleaned.

94
00:06:34,977 --> 00:06:38,397
Was that... Did you just put a bird's...
Is that a bird's nest from the oven?

95
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:39,771
You did come a bit early.

96
00:06:39,857 --> 00:06:41,647
No, I didn't. I'm three days late.

97
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:43,364
Well, no need to get all twisted up.

98
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:45,704
- Well...
- I can wake up the Fitches.

99
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,780
Jo Ellen and Nick
rent out their extra rooms.

100
00:06:48,866 --> 00:06:51,156
Of course, the husband's a bit handsy.

101
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:53,254
He pretends it's an accident,
but it isn't.

102
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,580
Um... Anyway, you look like
you can take care of yourself.

103
00:06:57,917 --> 00:06:58,957
Uh...

104
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:03,882
Oh, well, at least the fridge is stocked
with gourmet foods and beverages.

105
00:07:04,632 --> 00:07:06,512
I was going to take care of that earlier,

106
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:10,642
but we... we had a ribbon cutting ceremony
over at the firehouse.

107
00:07:10,721 --> 00:07:12,101
Got ourselves a new hose.

108
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:15,444
- When did you eat last?
- Why?

109
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:16,978
Hungry equals cranky.

110
00:07:17,061 --> 00:07:19,901
And between us gals,
you don't wear cranky well.

111
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:22,856
- Hm.
- Head to Jack's. By the time you get back,

112
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:25,822
I'll have the hot water running
and fresh towels and blankets.

113
00:07:25,903 --> 00:07:27,783
- Who's Jack? I...
- Jack's Bar.

114
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:30,494
Only place to eat in town after five.
You can walk.

115
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:31,905
Out the door and to the left.

116
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:33,743
Okay, but we're not done
talking about this.

117
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:35,198
Of course we aren't.

118
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:37,164

Uh, no. Uh, any chance of getting a cosmo?

00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:40,651
Nope. Not unless you brought
your own Cointreau.

139
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:42,229
I did not.

140
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,190

141
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:45,273
Not our thing.

142
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,238
But I have all the boys,
Johnnie, Jack, and Jim.

143
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:49,116
All the regular stuff and beer.
Just no frills.

00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:50,955
All right,
make it a Jim straight up.

145
00:08:50,988 --> 00:08:51,988
Okay.

146
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,580
I commend you on your choice.

147
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:56,660
Huh.

148
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:58,453

Wow. You should be a detective.

155
00:09:13,177 --> 00:09:15,757
No. My days of tracking bad guys are over.

156

- Sorry.

157
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,650
We don't get a lot of visitors.
Certainly not as beautiful as you.

I'm sorry. Does that line really work?

Oh, you'd be surprised.

Well, you're lucky
we're not in Los Angeles,

161
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,950
because Angelinos can smell BS
a mile away.

167
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:45,502
Well, it will be
in about 60 more payments.

168
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:50,546

00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:54,009
what brings you to our tiny little hamlet?

170
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:57,810

- Yeah?

171
00:09:58,681 --> 00:09:59,681
Where you staying?

172
00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:02,391
Uh, the McCrea cabin.

173
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:05,151
Oof. What'd you do to deserve that?

174
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:09,029
Yeah, I should have come up
and vetted the place first.

175
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:10,148
Oh, come on.

176
00:10:10,234 --> 00:10:12,114
I think spontaneity's
an admirable quality.

Oh, no. You... you can't credit me
with being spontaneous.

178
00:10:16,657 --> 00:10:20,447
No, it once took me six months
to buy a crêpe pan.

179
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:22,874
- Six months.
- Six months.

180
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:27,075
Yeah, I usually check everything
three times, and then I check it again.

181
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:29,464
Used to drive my...

182
00:10:34,258 --> 00:10:36,258
- So, how long you here for?
- Um...

183
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:38,219
A year.

184
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:40,137
I'm working with Dr. Mullins.

185
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:41,636
I'm a nurse.

186
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:43,104
Oh, that should be an experience.

187
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:45,274
Yeah. I imagine
it's gonna resemble the cabin.

188
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:47,233
- Uncomfortable.
- Exactly.

189
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:48,693
I think you might be right.

190
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:01,162
So, you know Dr. Mullins?

191
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:03,003
Oh, everybody knows everybody around here.

192
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:04,369
- Small town.
- Right.

193
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:05,455
And it's Doc.

194
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:07,375
He does not like formalities.

195
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:09,338
Oh, well, he does not like me.

196
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:10,958
I basically called him old.

197
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:11,875
But in my defense,

198
00:11:11,962 --> 00:11:15,262
I didn't know it was him I was talking to
when I said it.

199
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:18,388
- He is old.
- I know, right?

200
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:20,929
Thank you.

201
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:23,430
Preacher, Mel.

202
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:25,386
- Mel, Preacher.
- Hi.

203
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:32,319
Yeah, he's a man of few words,
but he's a good friend,

204
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,030
- and he's a great cook.
- Mm.

205
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,240
Um...

206
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:42,618
This is amazing. What is this?

207
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:43,702
Squirrel.

208
00:11:44,328 --> 00:11:45,368
Mm...

209
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:49,079
- That was too easy.
- That's not funny.

210
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:51,786
You're dining
on squash and lentils.

211
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:53,931
You know what?
I actually have had squirrel,

212
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:55,643
and if it's done right, it's pretty tasty.

213
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:57,633
Okay, well,
I'm gonna take your word on that.

214
00:11:59,343 --> 00:12:00,393
Oh, no, no, no.

215
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:03,807
If I have any more,
I won't be able to find the cabin.

216
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,103
Which might not be a bad thing, so...

217
00:12:06,308 --> 00:12:07,348
it's fine.

218
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:13,567
It's my car. God bless you, Bert.

219
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:15,069
I can't sleep in that.

220
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:17,742
You certainly can't drive.

221
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,110
Oh, no, no, no.

222
00:12:19,196 --> 00:12:21,736
No. I mean, leaving town's
just not even an option.

223
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:23,830
Would you like to know why?

224
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:25,540
I will tell you.

225
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:27,959
Because... I sold my house...

226
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:29,577
and most of my belongings.

227
00:12:29,665 --> 00:12:30,875
And then I quit my job.

228
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:34,248
And I moved to this town that I've never
heard of just so I could live in there.

229
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:35,756
- Yep.
- So...

230
00:12:37,047 --> 00:12:38,627
I hate it when Joey's right.

231
00:12:39,216 --> 00:12:40,256
You know?

232
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:41,342
Husband?

233
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:42,677
Sister.

234
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:44,763
- Yeah.
- Well...

235
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:47,142
if I had a spare room, I'd offer, but...

236
00:12:47,224 --> 00:12:49,854
Oh, no, no, no.
That's sweet, but it's... it's fine.

237
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:54,021
I'll just, you know, it'll be one night.

238
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:55,686
It'll be like camping. Right?

239
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:57,322
Yeah, sure.

240
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:04,777
Oh...

241
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:06,197
Mm-hm.

242
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:14,172
Oh.

243
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:16,667
It's not that bad, right?

244
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:18,168
Well...

245
00:13:18,255 --> 00:13:20,925
Perspective is most often
the key to happiness.

246
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:26,684
So, what you're saying
is that acclimation is possible.

247
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:27,854
Oh, yeah.

248
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:31,098
Just try not to insult any more residents.

249
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:34,562
Thank you, Jack.

250
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:37,725
Thank you for the... the help,

251
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:40,397
and the kind words, and food.

252
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:44,450
But mostly, thank you for the whiskey.

253
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:50,001
Any time, Mel.

254
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:25,700
Hey, Mark, do you know which box
the towels are in?

255
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:34,667
No...

256
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:37,842
but I found a set of sheets.

257
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:39,418
- Oh.
- Mm.

258
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:47,256
What are you doing with this?

259
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:48,604
I'm drying my hands.

260
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:50,103
Uh-uh.

261
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:52,390
This is personally autographed
by Bob Seger

262
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:55,234
and the entire Silver Bullet Band.

263
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:58,901
Handed down to me by my father,
who was at Cobo Hall in Detroit

264
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:01,861
on the night of the live recording
of their very first album.

265
00:15:01,942 --> 00:15:04,532
Now, one beautiful day
in the not-too-distant future,

266
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:06,662
I'm gonna hand this on to our son,
Mark Junior.

267
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:08,659
- Mm.
- And he to his son, Mark Junior Junior.

268
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:09,951
And so on and so forth.

269
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:12,660
Mm.

270
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:15,002
What if we have a girl?

271
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:21,381
Hmm.

272
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:23,881
What if we have a girl?

273
00:15:32,806 --> 00:15:33,966
Oh!

274
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:36,308
Oh, Mark, stop!

275
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:23,124
Oh!

276
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:24,882
Come on!

277
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:29,172
I hate this place.

278
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:31,255
God. Ugh!

279
00:17:39,683 --> 00:17:41,063
It's too early for lectures.

280
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:42,443
Hey, I didn't say a thing.

281
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:43,769
Yeah, you didn't have to.

282
00:17:46,356 --> 00:17:47,516
So?

283
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:49,688
The pretty lady make it home last night?

284
00:17:50,277 --> 00:17:51,197
She had a ring on.

285
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:52,648
Yeah, I wasn't sure you noticed.

286
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:54,238
I did.

287
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:04,313
That gun's not loaded, right?

288
00:19:05,894 --> 00:19:09,234
Okay. Uh, first, I just wanted
to say thank you

289
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:10,874
for stopping and helping me last night.

290
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:15,861
And second, I would like to apologize
for what I said.

291
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:17,236
The part where you called me old

292
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:19,492
or the part where you said
I can't handle my practice?

293
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:24,535
In my defense, I was told
by Mrs. McCrea that you were elderly

294
00:19:24,621 --> 00:19:25,932
and nearing retirement.

295
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:28,826
It took me 30 years
to build this practice from scratch.

296
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:30,334
No help.

297
00:19:30,627 --> 00:19:32,747
No nurse. I don't need ya.

298
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:34,168
Well, I signed a contract.

299
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:35,466
Hah. Not with me, you didn't.

300
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:37,529
I don't even recall interviewing you,

301
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:40,433
but maybe that's...
that's just my dementia actin' up.

302
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:45,427
Well, I was hired to do a job,
and I'm here to do that job.

303
00:19:47,394 --> 00:19:50,484
You know, in this county,
trespassers can be shot...

304
00:19:51,064 --> 00:19:52,064
on sight.

305
00:19:56,236 --> 00:19:58,066
Uh, I'm not trespassing.

306
00:19:58,155 --> 00:20:00,365
Do you work here? No.

307
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:01,949
Are you a patient here? No.

308
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:04,204
Did I invite you in? No.

309
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:07,036
If it looks like a duck
and quacks like a duck,

310
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:08,122
that is a duck.

311
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,128
Okay. What are you gonna do, shoot me?

312
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,250
Oh-ho-ho.

313
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:22,096
Well, it's finally happened.

314
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:23,889
- You've lost your damn mind.
- Ow.

315
00:20:23,972 --> 00:20:25,352
You threatened her with a gun?

316
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:26,852
I simply educated her

317
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:31,104
- on some of our local laws.
- You are a stubborn goat.

318
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:33,648
I think you mean stubborn old goat.

319
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:35,292
You're old. I'm old. It's not a secret.

320
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:38,397
- I told you I would find somebody myself.
- Maybe I should just go...

321
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:39,487
- Go!
- Stay!

322
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:42,200
I gave you an entire year.

323
00:20:42,282 --> 00:20:43,912
This is not your business.

324
00:20:43,992 --> 00:20:46,832
- This town depends on both of us.
- And who put you in charge?

325
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:48,912
The town did when they elected me mayor.

326
00:20:48,997 --> 00:20:51,327
- You ran unopposed.
- The point is, I won.

327
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,416
You are the only one
who thinks I need any help.

328
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:55,002
- The only one.
- Bull.

329
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:58,087
Everyone thinks you need help.
They're just too scared to tell you.

330
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:02,637
Vernon, we both know
you can't be in two places at once.

331
00:21:11,186 --> 00:21:13,766
Even for you, that was low.

332
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:34,038
I thought you were dead.

333
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:36,876
Hey, I'm sorry, sis. I...

334
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:38,882
Yeah, I was about to call out
the National Guard.

335
00:21:38,922 --> 00:21:42,382
Well, they probably wouldn't
be able to find this place, anyway.

336
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:44,635
What's wrong?

337
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:46,678
Nothing. I'm fi... I'm fine.

338
00:21:47,347 --> 00:21:50,137
I'm worried about you.
Just tell me what's goin' on.

339
00:21:50,225 --> 00:21:51,265
Um, nothing.

340
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:55,062
Nothing, nothing. I'm... fine.

341
00:21:58,608 --> 00:21:59,778
I just...

342
00:22:05,198 --> 00:22:08,408
It's just this doctor that I'm working for
doesn't want me here.

343
00:22:10,537 --> 00:22:12,287
And this cabin I'm in, it's just...

344
00:22:12,372 --> 00:22:13,672
it's just awful.

345
00:22:13,957 --> 00:22:14,957
And I...

346
00:22:16,209 --> 00:22:19,129
I just feel really alone right now.

347
00:22:19,963 --> 00:22:21,923
Mel, you are not alone.

348
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,009
Okay? Come back here.

349
00:22:24,092 --> 00:22:26,012
You can stay with us
for as long as you want.

350
00:22:26,094 --> 00:22:28,854
Mel, stop trying to punish yourself
for what happened.

351
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:30,180
Nobody blames you.

352
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:32,975
Just come home.

353
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:39,821
Honey, all you changed by moving
was your address.

354
00:22:42,652 --> 00:22:44,862
I'm sorry, Joe.
I'm gonna call you tomorrow, okay?

355
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:47,317
- I love you.
- No.

356
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:06,590
Hey.

357
00:23:06,676 --> 00:23:09,136
I've got goat, beef,
venison, rabbit, and buffalo.

358
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:10,851
Uh... Any fish?

359
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:14,561
You know, you should try the salad
with the shaved brussels sprouts and kale.

360
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:17,274
- Kale?
- Yeah.

361
00:23:17,354 --> 00:23:19,404
All of Preacher's vegetables
are farm-to-table,

362
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:21,401
and the farm is about
50 feet from the table.

363
00:23:21,983 --> 00:23:24,283
Okay, great.
Well, I'll have that salad, please.

364
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:29,162
- Thanks for the assist.
- I'm Paige Lassiter.

365
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:30,241
I run the bakery truck.

366
00:23:30,283 --> 00:23:33,203
- Hi. I'm Mel...
- Monroe. Yeah, the new nurse.

367
00:23:33,286 --> 00:23:37,116
In small towns, the internet is slow,
but the gossip is fast.

368
00:23:37,207 --> 00:23:38,207
Right.

369
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:40,495
Is that a Celine bag?

370
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:41,665
Um...

371
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:43,207
Yes, it is.

372
00:23:43,296 --> 00:23:47,506
I'm probably the only person in
Virgin River with a subscription to Vogue.

373
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:48,892
So, this...

374
00:23:49,553 --> 00:23:53,683
Um... Anyway, you should stop by
for a muffin or something.

375
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:55,725
- Oh?
- Yeah. Us girls should stick together.

376
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:56,729
Absolutely.

377
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:58,730
- Okay. It's nice to meet you.
- You too.

378
00:24:29,217 --> 00:24:30,217
Look...

379
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:33,184
- you are a brilliant doctor...
- Huh.

380
00:24:34,681 --> 00:24:37,391
But when you're finally ready
to hang up your stethoscope,

381
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:40,396
you'll be leaving behind
a gaping hole in this community.

382
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,230
I don't even know her.

383
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:46,147
She ranked top of her class at UC Irvine,

384
00:24:46,234 --> 00:24:47,994
did her practical at County USC,

385
00:24:48,069 --> 00:24:51,199
then she spent five years
working emergency at Cedars-Sinai.

386
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:53,331
Her references are good as gold.

387
00:24:53,408 --> 00:24:54,868
Then what the heck's she doin' here?

388
00:24:55,452 --> 00:24:58,292
I guess she... wanted a change.

389
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:04,539
Even if you're too stubborn to admit it,
we both know you need help.

390
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:07,549
Give her a chance.

391
00:25:10,091 --> 00:25:11,301
You got nothing to lose.

392
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:22,767
Thirty days.

393
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:25,404
But... if she can't cut it,

394
00:25:25,482 --> 00:25:29,072
I've got your word this is the last time
you stick your nose in my business.

395
00:25:45,835 --> 00:25:47,165
Ooh. Good choice.

396
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:48,796
This is so delicious.

397
00:25:48,838 --> 00:25:50,088
Well, you sound surprised.

398
00:25:50,173 --> 00:25:54,183
Oh, no, it's totally normal to have
a gourmet kale and brussels sprout salad

399
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:57,181
at a bar in the middle of nowhere
surrounded by animal heads.

400
00:25:58,390 --> 00:25:59,510
You want something to drink?

401
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:00,848
I would kill for a latte.

402
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:02,644
Sorry. Nearest Starbucks, 80 miles away.

403
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:03,557
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

404
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:05,605
You know there's a Starbucks
in Kuala Lumpur?

405
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:07,444
Um, Nurses Beyond Borders.

406
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:08,524
Oh.

407
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:09,940
A humanitarian.

408
00:26:10,777 --> 00:26:12,857
There's so many things
to learn about you, huh?

409
00:26:12,946 --> 00:26:15,316
Hm. Yeah, well, according to Doc,
I'm an ageist.

410
00:26:15,865 --> 00:26:18,285
Well, good thing
I'm still relatively young and attractive.

411
00:26:18,368 --> 00:26:20,048
You know,
looks have nothing to do with it.

412
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,750
You're the only restaurant in town.

413
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:23,750
Oh, yeah, you keep telling yourself that.

414
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:26,042
What I keep telling myself
is that I'm crazy

415
00:26:26,126 --> 00:26:27,916
for not packing up and going home.

416
00:26:30,297 --> 00:26:31,297
Good news.

417
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:33,983
Doc's not gonna throw you a parade,
but he agreed to try you out.

418
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:35,139
You start immediately.

419
00:26:36,219 --> 00:26:37,719
Hope, you've already hired me.

420
00:26:37,804 --> 00:26:38,974
Well, here's the thing.

421
00:26:39,222 --> 00:26:42,642
I'm paying your salary,
but it is his practice, so...

422
00:26:42,726 --> 00:26:44,056
Why didn't you just tell me that?

423
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:45,984
Honey, then you wouldn't have come,
would you?

424
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:49,406
Like my father said to my mother
at the altar,

425
00:26:49,482 --> 00:26:51,692
"You're already here,
so let's make the best of it."

426
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:53,146
Hmm.

427
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:56,029
Well, I'm not staying
in that shack another night.

428
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:57,664
I gotta side with Mel on that one.

429
00:26:57,741 --> 00:26:58,741
You stay out of this.

430
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:01,371
Do I need to remind you that we have a...

431
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:03,793
Oh, oh, I'm fully aware
that we have a contract.

432
00:27:04,247 --> 00:27:08,247
Okay? I'm also aware that
suitable housing was part of the deal,

433
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:10,125
so technically, you're in breach.

434
00:27:10,545 --> 00:27:13,345
Which means the contract is null and void.
I can leave whenever I want.

435
00:27:23,558 --> 00:27:25,808
Can you afford to have her leave?

436
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:27,811
No.

437
00:27:28,938 --> 00:27:31,148
Well, why don't you get her a room
at the Fitches'?

438
00:27:31,232 --> 00:27:33,152
I'll fix up the cabin.
Ricky could help me.

439
00:27:33,234 --> 00:27:34,864
I'm not made of money.

440
00:27:34,944 --> 00:27:37,364
Hope,
please don't poor-mouth to me.

441
00:27:37,447 --> 00:27:40,487
You and I both know you couldn't spend
half of what you have if you tried.

442
00:27:40,575 --> 00:27:44,195
You're offering an awful lot of yourself
to help a complete stranger.

443
00:27:44,621 --> 00:27:46,921
Oh, Hope,
I thought you knew me better than that.

444
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:49,878
Jack, I've known you a long time.

445
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:53,419
If Mel was short for Melvin,
we wouldn't be having this conversation.

446
00:27:56,466 --> 00:27:58,926
I believe Hope has some good news for you.

447
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:03,929
I'll put you up at the Fitches' while
I figure out what to do with the cabin.

448
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:05,725
The place with the handsy husband?

449
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:07,938
Did I say that?

450
00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:14,981
You know, I can fight my own battles.

451
00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:16,988
Never turn down help
when deep in a foxhole.

452
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:22,486
How about a show
of Virgin River hospitality?

453
00:28:23,076 --> 00:28:24,826
Why don't I take you on a tour tomorrow?

454
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:27,286
Okay, tell you what.

455
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:30,634
I'm gonna be at the river at seven a.m.

456
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:32,669
If you want to join me,

457
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:34,712
I'll be there.

458
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,360
Uh...

459
00:28:58,903 --> 00:29:01,493
Hey. Uh, so, should I just pull up a chart
and grab a patient?

460
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:03,323
- No.
- No?

461
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:07,790
No. Until I can confirm
that you are competent, no patients.

462
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:11,423
Well, how can you confirm my competency
if I can't see any patients?

463
00:29:11,499 --> 00:29:15,089
Chitchat is over.
I've got a waitin' room full of people.

464
00:29:40,487 --> 00:29:42,487
- Welcome.
- Hi.

465
00:29:42,572 --> 00:29:45,282
Oh, I am sorry that my husband
isn't here to greet you as well.

466
00:29:45,366 --> 00:29:48,076
- Oh...
- He's doing a supply run in Grace Valley.

467
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:52,291
We only have one room left, and, uh...
I'm nervous that you won't like it.

468
00:29:52,582 --> 00:29:54,422
Hope told me that you're very picky.

469
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:56,342
Yeah.

470
00:29:56,419 --> 00:29:58,589
- Come take a look.
- Okay.

471
00:29:59,172 --> 00:30:01,012
- After you.
- Thank you.

472
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:31,639
Boy, you picked the wrong place to rob.

473
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:35,349
Get your hands up.

474
00:31:37,645 --> 00:31:39,975
Now turn around. Slowly.

475
00:31:43,943 --> 00:31:46,493
Oh-ho-ho!

476
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:47,701
Come on.

477
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:48,620
Hey, man.

478
00:31:48,698 --> 00:31:50,738
Brady!

479
00:31:50,825 --> 00:31:53,785
Bro, what are you doing in here, man?

480
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:56,330
I was leaving you a note.
Wanted to let you know I was okay.

481
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:57,734
How the hell did you get in here?

482
00:31:57,790 --> 00:32:00,250
Come on.
I know where you keep the spare key.

483
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:03,351
Listen, I... I've got plans this morning.

484
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:06,631
But why don't you go get something to eat,
and then go up to my room,

485
00:32:07,508 --> 00:32:09,798
grab some sleep,
and then clean yourself up, okay?

486
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:10,966
All right.

487
00:32:11,846 --> 00:32:12,676
Long time.

488
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:13,764
Welcome back.

489
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:15,891
Thanks, man.

490
00:32:16,684 --> 00:32:17,684
Yeah.

491
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:39,790
Hey!

492
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:41,917
Hey.

493
00:32:42,168 --> 00:32:43,878
Are you coming up, or am I coming down?

494
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:46,012
- You're comin' down here.
- Okay.

495
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:54,309
Oh, I see you got a coffee.

496
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:56,559
Yeah. Paige's bakery truck.

497
00:32:57,558 --> 00:32:58,978
You could have mentioned it.

498
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:01,600
- I believe in self-discovery.
- Ah.

499
00:33:01,688 --> 00:33:03,308
- And practicality.
- Ah!

500
00:33:03,898 --> 00:33:04,938
Yeah.

501
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:07,987
- No, thank you.
- No, no, no. I insist.

502
00:33:09,195 --> 00:33:10,195
Where are we going?

503
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:11,858
I cleared your morning with Doc.

504
00:33:13,199 --> 00:33:14,449
You cleared my morning.

505
00:33:14,534 --> 00:33:16,174
Well, there's no cell reception out here,

506
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:19,794
so I figured you wouldn't want to give Doc
any more ammunition by being late, so...

507
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:22,542
- Wow.
- But let me help you.

508
00:33:23,209 --> 00:33:25,379
No, no.
I don't need your assistance, okay?

509
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:29,257
Okay. I'm sorry I called Doc for you.
It won't happen again.

510
00:33:30,049 --> 00:33:31,769
Now, you wanna put your hand
on my shoulder?

511
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:34,757
Okay, now step.

512
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:36,099
Oh...

513
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:37,350
And... other one.

514
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:38,432
Step.

515
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:40,017
Okay.

516
00:33:40,643 --> 00:33:42,773
- All right. We can leave this here.
- Wait.

517
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:44,024
No. No, no, no.

518
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:45,265
My whole life is in that bag.

519
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:47,026
Oh, look, no one's gonna take it.

520
00:33:48,234 --> 00:33:49,574
- Hm?
- Because no one's here.

521
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:54,621
- Trust me?
- Hm.

522
00:34:05,001 --> 00:34:05,841
Aah.

523
00:34:05,918 --> 00:34:07,748
Mm. Hey, thank you.

524
00:34:12,508 --> 00:34:15,548
- Uh... How much further?
- We're almost there.

525
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:35,322
Wow.

526
00:34:36,991 --> 00:34:38,411
It's not even the best part.

527
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:42,579
Eagles.

528
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:46,166
Here.

529
00:34:53,466 --> 00:34:55,006
This is their favorite spot.

530
00:34:56,636 --> 00:34:57,636
Mine too.

531
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:02,095
They're incredible. Huh.

532
00:35:02,391 --> 00:35:03,391
Yeah.

533
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:12,442
So, what's next?

534
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:15,779
Nothin'.

535
00:35:31,921 --> 00:35:32,921
Here.

536
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:36,009
Oh, thank you.

537
00:35:37,385 --> 00:35:38,385
Yeah.

538
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:47,601
Aah.

539
00:35:51,899 --> 00:35:54,239
I think I can actually
hear my heart beating.

540
00:35:55,361 --> 00:35:59,701
"In peace, nothing so becomes a man..."
Or woman...

541
00:36:01,117 --> 00:36:03,657
- "...as modest stillness."
- Shakespeare?

542
00:36:04,203 --> 00:36:06,123
- Mm.
- You an English major?

543
00:36:06,205 --> 00:36:07,665
Hm?

544
00:36:07,748 --> 00:36:09,288
No, I never went to college.

545
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:11,997
But in my 20s,
I loved to read while drinkin',

546
00:36:12,086 --> 00:36:13,376
so it kind of all evens out.

547
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:18,178
Uh...

548
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:20,299
- Is that hunters?
- Yeah, could be.

549
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:21,925
Could be somethin' else.

550
00:36:23,097 --> 00:36:26,097
There's a lot of illegal pot fields
outside of Virgin River.

551
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:27,984
But it's legal now.

552
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:31,360
Yeah. It doesn't stop the illegal growers
from doin' business.

553
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,570
Cross them, and things can turn dangerous.

554
00:36:39,363 --> 00:36:43,373
I used to work in the, uh...
ER Level One Trauma Center,

555
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:46,201
so I've seen my fair share
of what dangerous can do.

556
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:48,079
ER, huh?

557
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:50,627
Sounds like an intense job.

558
00:36:51,834 --> 00:36:53,134
Yeah, you could say that.

559
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:58,053
But I'm sure owning a bar
has its challenges.

560
00:37:00,134 --> 00:37:02,304
Piece of cake,
compared to my time in the service.

561
00:37:02,845 --> 00:37:05,005
Marine.
Joined up right out of high school.

562
00:37:05,097 --> 00:37:07,427
Spent 20-plus years,
mostly in the Middle East.

563
00:37:07,516 --> 00:37:10,306
Preacher was with me.
And Brady. You haven't met him yet.

564
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,480
Wow.

565
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:17,067
Do you miss it?

566
00:37:18,778 --> 00:37:19,778
Yes and no.

567
00:37:20,696 --> 00:37:21,946
I had, um...

568
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:25,283
People who... depended on me.

569
00:37:27,536 --> 00:37:29,866
And Virgin River, well, it's, uh...

570
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:33,794
it's a utopia, compared to a war zone.

571
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:49,142
- Oh, here.
- Oh...

572
00:37:50,017 --> 00:37:51,017
Come on...

573
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:52,102
- Aah.
- Thank you.

574
00:37:52,728 --> 00:37:53,728
You're welcome.

575
00:37:58,734 --> 00:37:59,824
Thanks for this morning.

576
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:01,534
It was my pleasure.

577
00:38:07,034 --> 00:38:08,244
Well, I'll see you around.

578
00:38:09,161 --> 00:38:10,161
Yeah, you will.

579
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:14,958
- See ya.
- Bye.

580
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:25,468
Hello?

581
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:27,846
Doc?

582
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:41,151
Is Doc here?

583
00:38:42,111 --> 00:38:44,781
Hi, there. No, no, he's not in right now.

584
00:38:45,573 --> 00:38:46,743
He'll be back soon.

585
00:38:47,908 --> 00:38:48,738
I'll wait.

586
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:51,696
Uh... I'm the new nurse practitioner.
Maybe I can help you.

587
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:54,620
Uh... Oh, I'll wait for Doc.

588
00:38:54,707 --> 00:38:55,537
Ooh...

589
00:38:55,624 --> 00:38:57,424
- Um... When are you due?
- Ooh...

590
00:38:57,501 --> 00:38:59,001
Any day now.

591
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:02,423
It's okay.

592
00:39:02,673 --> 00:39:04,593
Okay. I think I should take a look at you.

593
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:06,275
I don't know when the doctor'll be back.

594
00:39:07,136 --> 00:39:08,346
- Okay?
- Okay.

595
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:10,009
- Okay. Can you stand?
- Okay.

596
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:12,055
Uh... Yeah.

597
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:14,810
- Yeah.
- It's okay. Just take a breath.

598
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:16,726
- Ready? One, two, three. Up.
- Okay.

599
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:18,355
There you go.

600
00:39:19,482 --> 00:39:21,112
It's okay. You're gonna be just fine.

601
00:39:21,942 --> 00:39:22,992
- Okay?
- Okay.

602
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:24,201
Yeah.

603
00:39:24,278 --> 00:39:26,318
- What's your name?
- Polly.

604
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:28,911
- Polly Fishburn.
- Polly Fishburn.

605
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:30,367
My name's Mel.

606
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:32,955
And I'm gonna take
really good care of you, okay?

607
00:39:32,995 --> 00:39:33,995
Okay.

608
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:36,982
You're gonna be just fine now.
Can you get up on this table?

609
00:39:37,291 --> 00:39:38,541
- Yeah.
- Got it?

610
00:39:38,793 --> 00:39:41,093
You got it. You got it.

611
00:39:42,171 --> 00:39:43,171
Yeah...

612
00:39:45,466 --> 00:39:47,756
I've gone through
last night's receipts twice.

613
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:49,970
- Mm-hm?
- The cash box is light.

614
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:55,229
Oh, y... you know what?

615
00:39:55,309 --> 00:39:58,979
I advanced Ricky a week to prep
the McCrea cabin for some maintenance. I...

616
00:39:59,688 --> 00:40:01,568
I thought I logged that.
Must have forgotten.

617
00:40:03,484 --> 00:40:05,494
Oh, look who's back in town...

618
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:07,237
Brady.

619
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:09,570
So, how long before you disappear again?

620
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:11,527
I told him he could stay
as long as he wants.

621
00:40:11,617 --> 00:40:12,697
Mm.

622
00:40:12,785 --> 00:40:15,955
I'm gonna head to Clear River.
Run some errands. Catch you in a bit.

623
00:40:16,372 --> 00:40:17,372
Yeah.

624
00:40:27,466 --> 00:40:28,586
Uh, I left...

625
00:40:30,344 --> 00:40:32,684
a lot of kids behind who I couldn't help.

626
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:35,183
I can help Brady, okay?
I'm not turning my back on him.

627
00:40:36,308 --> 00:40:39,148
Well, then, you may wanna
change the locks on the office door.

628
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:44,568
Or you may be "advancing Ricky"
a whole lot more than a week's pay.

629
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:57,910
What is goin' on?

630
00:40:57,997 --> 00:40:59,417
- I'm with a patient.
- No, I...

631
00:40:59,498 --> 00:41:01,208
I'm almost done. I'll be right out.

632
00:41:04,044 --> 00:41:04,924
Is everything okay?

633
00:41:05,004 --> 00:41:08,384
You're doing fine.
Your baby is doing fine, okay?

634
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:12,506
You're just having... some Braxton Hicks.

635
00:41:12,595 --> 00:41:14,135
- Oh.
- False labor pains.

636
00:41:14,221 --> 00:41:16,721
They don't feel false though, do they?

637
00:41:16,807 --> 00:41:17,847
- No.
- No.

638
00:41:19,185 --> 00:41:21,185
Uh... Why don't you just
lay here and rest,

639
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:23,690
and I'll go call your husband
to come pick you up, okay?

640
00:41:23,772 --> 00:41:24,772
Okay.

641
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:26,649
Thanks, Mel.

642
00:41:27,026 --> 00:41:28,106
You're very welcome.

643
00:41:35,951 --> 00:41:38,472
- Who said you could give her an exam?
- I was just doing my job.

644
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:41,326
This is my practice.
My name is on that door.

645
00:41:41,415 --> 00:41:44,495
You do not work with a patient
unless you have my permission.

646
00:41:44,585 --> 00:41:46,375
Polly was having Braxton Hicks.

647
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:49,262
I had to examine her to make sure
that she wasn't in premature labor.

648
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:52,180
Did you know there's protein in her urine?

649
00:41:52,259 --> 00:41:54,009
Don't lecture me about my patient.

650
00:41:54,094 --> 00:41:55,214
Well, it's not in her chart.

651
00:41:55,262 --> 00:41:58,352
- I don't put everything in the chart.
- Uh-huh.

652
00:41:58,432 --> 00:42:00,682
- Okay, well, where do you put it?
- Right here.

653
00:42:01,894 --> 00:42:04,524
And if you're not here to tell me
what's not in the chart?

654
00:42:04,605 --> 00:42:08,525
My dear, I'm not just old, I'm old-school.

655
00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:10,949
And in my day,
a nurse would never, never question

656
00:42:11,028 --> 00:42:13,318
the methods of a supervising physician.

657
00:42:13,405 --> 00:42:15,025
A nurse would know her place.

658
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:19,083
Well, I hope you'll join me
in the 21st century.

659
00:42:19,161 --> 00:42:20,501
And your point is?

660
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:25,080
This time it was false labor,
but what about the next Polly or whoever?

661
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:27,878
Wh... Do you want me to just stand by

662
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:29,842
and watch someone bleed out
if you're not here?

663
00:42:29,922 --> 00:42:31,842
You should have called me.

664
00:42:31,924 --> 00:42:33,554
I had things under control.

665
00:42:34,134 --> 00:42:36,394
These patients, they are like my family.

666
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:37,890
And I cannot trust you with them

667
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:40,102
unless I know for sure
you're not gonna hurt someone.

668
00:42:41,934 --> 00:42:46,694
So, if I can't do what I was hired
to do, what is it that you want me to do?

669
00:42:47,273 --> 00:42:48,983
Well, straighten up the office.

670
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:51,646
File things.
Uh... Keep the coffee pot full.

671
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:54,029
I like mine black and fresh.

672
00:42:58,367 --> 00:42:59,367
Hello, Polly.

673
00:43:01,328 --> 00:43:02,928
He's refusing to let me do my job.

674
00:43:02,997 --> 00:43:04,827
- Give it time.
- No, no, no, no, no.

675
00:43:04,915 --> 00:43:06,375
This is not about time.

676
00:43:06,625 --> 00:43:10,375
Okay, good medicine is about teamwork,
and he doesn't want me on his team.

677
00:43:10,462 --> 00:43:11,552
He'll come around.

678
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:14,380
He is rude, he is demeaning,

679
00:43:14,717 --> 00:43:16,337
and he's a big-time chauvinist.

680
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:18,677
The man's got his quirks,
I'll give you that.

681
00:43:18,762 --> 00:43:22,022
It's obvious that he needs somebody,
but it's not gonna work like this, okay?

682
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:24,939
It needs to be his idea,
or he's never gonna accept it.

683
00:43:25,019 --> 00:43:26,769
My grandfather was just like him.

684
00:43:26,854 --> 00:43:27,944
So, you understand.

685
00:43:28,022 --> 00:43:29,902
Yeah, and he's never gonna change.

686
00:43:30,774 --> 00:43:34,654
Look, Hope, the bottom line is
that this is not what I signed up for.

687
00:43:40,826 --> 00:43:42,446
Join the club, sweetheart.

688
00:43:43,495 --> 00:43:45,825
Life rarely gives us what we want.

689
00:43:45,914 --> 00:43:49,294
Okay...
I didn't join a club, okay? I took a job.

690
00:43:49,752 --> 00:43:51,752
I'm sorry, I have to give you notice.

691
00:43:52,504 --> 00:43:55,265
I'll give you time to find someone,
but you need to start looking now.
