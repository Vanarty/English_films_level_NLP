1
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,644
<i>I believe we have a choice in this
world about how to tell sad stories.</i>

2
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,485
<i>On the one hand,
you can sugarcoat it.</i>

3
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,086
<i>The way they do in movies
and romance novels...</i>

4
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:49,642
<i>where beautiful people
learn beautiful lessons...</i>

5
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,928
<i>where nothing is too messed
up that can't be fixed...</i>

6
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,003
<i>with an apology
and a Peter Gabriel song.</i>

7
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,247
<i>I like that version as much
as the next girl does,</i>

8
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,481
<i>believe me.</i>

9
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,329
<i>It's just not the truth.</i>

10
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:03,806
<i>This is the truth.</i>

11
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,361
<i>Sorry.</i>

12
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:15,600
<i>Late in the winter
of my seventeenth year...</i>

13
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:18,681
<i>my mother decided
that I was depressed.</i>

14
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:23,171
She just eats like a bird,
she barely leaves the house.

15
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,845
I am not depressed, Mom.

16
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,684
She's reading the same
book over and over.

17
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:27,841
She's depressed.

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,411
I'm not depressed.

19
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,961
<i>The booklets and the websites
always list depression as</i>

20
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,326
<i>a side effect of cancer.</i>

21
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,201
<i>Depression's not
a side effect of cancer.</i>

22
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,688
<i>It's a side effect of dying.</i>

23
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:46,408
<i>Which is what
was happening to me.</i>

24
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,564
I may switch you to Zoloft.

25
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,445
Or Lexapro.

26
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,011
And twice a day instead of once.

27
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,685
Why stop there?
Hmm?

28
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,040
Really, just keep them coming.

29
00:02:13,064 --> 00:02:14,793
I'm like the Keith Richards
of cancer kids.

30
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:17,366
Have you been going to that
support group I suggested?

31
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,931
Yeah, it's not my thing.

32
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,525
Support groups
can be a great way

33
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,200
for you to connect
with people who are...

34
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:25,125
Who are... What?

35
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,721
...on the same journey.

36
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,888
"Journey"? Really?

37
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,160
Give it a chance.

38
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,402
Who knows, you might even
find it enlightening.

39
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,530
All right.

40
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,406
Are you guys ready?

41
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,725
We are gathered here today

42
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:47,566
literally in the heart of Jesus.

43
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,926
We're here with J.C.

44
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,048
Who wants to share their
story with the group?

45
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,641
I'm Angel.

46
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,449
I have acute myeloid leukemia.

47
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,600
Sid. Acute lymphoblastic
leukemia.

48
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:04,723
Hi, I'm PJ.
Um, I have neuroblastoma.

49
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:07,167
I'm Patrick.

50
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,287
Testicular.

51
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:12,126
<i>I'll spare you the gory
details of Patrick's ball cancer.</i>

52
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,451
<i>Basically, they found it
in his nuts...</i>

53
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:19,281
<i>they cut most of it out, and he
almost died, but he didn't die.</i>

54
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,007
<i>So now, here he is,
divorced, friendless...</i>

55
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,128
<i>living on his parents' couch...</i>

56
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:30,331
<i>exploiting his cancer-tastic
past in the heart of Jesus.</i>

57
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,681
<i>Literally.</i>

58
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,640
<i>To show us that one day,
if we 're lucky.</i> ..

59
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,804
<i>We could be just like him.</i>

60
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,687
Who's next?

61
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,971
Hazel?

62
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,681
Um...

63
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,000
I'm Hazel.

64
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,690
Uh, thyroid, originally...

65
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,683
but now with
quite the impressive

66
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,569
satellite colony in my lungs.

67
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,769
And how are you doing?

68
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,401
<i>Uh, you mean besides
the terminal cancer?</i>

69
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,688
All right, I guess.

70
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,362
We're here for you, Hazel.

71
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,728
Why don't I play another song?

72
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,291
<i>Christ is our friend</i>

73
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,203
<i>And he'll be there till the end</i>

74
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,600
<i>Christ is our friend</i>

75
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,967
<i>And he'll be there till the end</i>

76
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:35,087
<i>Christ</i>

77
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,770
Hey, sweet pea.

78
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:50,168
So... was it awesome?

79
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,567
"Yeah, Mom,
it was awesome!"

80
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,528
<i>HAZEL". And that was my life.</i>

81
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,610
<i>Reality shows.</i>

82
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,361
<i>Doctor's appointments.</i>

83
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,888
<i>Eight prescription drugs,
three times a day.</i>

84
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,730
<i>But worst, worst,
worst of all...</i>

85
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,361
<i>Support group-</i>

86
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,320
- You cannot make me.
- Of course we can.

87
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,566
We're your parents.

88
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,325
Come on,
we've been through this.

89
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,447
You need to go.

90
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,728
You need to make friends,
and be a teenager.

91
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,320
Mom, if you want me
to be a teenager,

92
00:05:26,344 --> 00:05:27,930
you don't send me
to support group.

93
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,243
You gotta get me a fake ID
so that I can go to clubs...

94
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,050
and drink gimlets and take pot.

95
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,282
Uh, you don't "take" pot.

96
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,960
Well, that is the kind of thing
I would know with a fake ID.

97
00:05:38,984 --> 00:05:41,351
Can you
just get in the car, please?

98
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,410
<i>And</i> so <i>I</i> went.

99
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,963
<i>Not because I wanted to, or because
I thought it would help</i> me...

100
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,130
<i>but for the same reason
I did anything these days.</i>

101
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,281
<i>To make my parents happy.</i>

102
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,640
I really don't understand
why I can't just drive myself.

103
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,280
It's not like you're
gonna do anything.

104
00:06:00,354 --> 00:06:02,118
You're just gonna sit here
and wait again.

105
00:06:02,354 --> 00:06:03,451
Of course I'm not.

106
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,241
No, I've got stuff to do.
I'm gonna do errands.

107
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,367
Yeah.

108
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,811
I love you.

109
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:10,961
I love you, too.

110
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,411
Have fun.

111
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:16,166
<i>The only thing worse
than biting it from cancer...</i>

112
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,482
<i>is having a kid
bite it from cancer.</i>

113
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,286
Hey!

114
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,768
Make some friends.

115
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,285
Oh, sorry.

116
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,720
I'll take the stairs.
No problem.

117
00:06:30,744 --> 00:06:31,745
Thank you.

118
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,926
Sorry.

119
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,606
My bad.

120
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,004
I'm sorry.

121
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,405
Oh, my God.

122
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,845
<i>So, who would like to start?</i>

123
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,004
Does anyone want to start?
Who wants to kick it off?

124
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,010
Go ahead.

125
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,323
I'm Beth. I have
spindle cell sarcoma.

126
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,891
It's been an okay week.

127
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,890
Isaac, I know that you're
facing some challenges right now.

128
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,690
Do you want to share
with the group?

129
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,046
Or maybe your friend, here?

130
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,567
No, I'll share.

131
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,850
Hey, guys. Uh...

132
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,043
Hi, I'm Isaac.

133
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,725
I have retinoblastoma.

134
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,040
We had surgery on one eye
when I was younger...

135
00:07:45,064 --> 00:07:46,684
so this is a glass eye.

136
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:49,280
And then I'm going in to the
hospital to have another surgery...

137
00:07:49,304 --> 00:07:50,400
to take out the other eye.

138
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,927
So, after that surgery, I'm
just gonna be totally blind.

139
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:56,000
But I'm lucky, because I have this
beautiful, smoking hot girlfriend...

140
00:07:56,024 --> 00:07:58,391
who's way out of my league.
Monica.

141
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:03,248
And I have great friends like
Augustus Waters to help me out.

142
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,205
So, that's what's up.
Thanks.

143
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,124
We're here for you, Isaac.

144
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,606
Thank you.

145
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,760
Your turn, Gus.

146
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:13,966
Yeah, sure.

147
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,926
Um, I'm Augustus Waters.

148
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,764
I'm 18 years old

149
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:24,811
and I had a touch of osteosarcoma
about a year-and-a-half ago.

150
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,487
So, I've lost this baby
as a result.

151
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:32,768
And, uh, now I'm part
cyborg, which is awesome.

152
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:36,242
But, really, I'm just
here at Isaac's request.

153
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,801
And how are you feeling, Gus?

154
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,884
I'm grand, yeah.

155
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,287
I'm on a roller coaster that
only goes up, my friend.

156
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,560
Maybe you'd like to share
your fears with the group?

157
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,131
My fears?

158
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,326
Oblivion.

159
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,761
Oblivion?

160
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,126
Yeah.

161
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,681
You see, I intend to live
an extraordinary life.

162
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,841
To be remembered.

163
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,720
So, I'd say if I have any fears,

164
00:09:01,744 --> 00:09:03,872
it would be to not do that.

165
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:09,162
Would anyone else in the
group like to speak to that?

166
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,086
Hazel?

167
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,284
Unexpected.

168
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,085
I just want to say
that there's gonna

169
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,810
come a time when
all of us are dead.

170
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,890
There was a time before humans

171
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,610
and there's gonna
be a time after.

172
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,080
It could be tomorrow, it could
be a million years from now.

173
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,009
And when it does,
there will be no one left...

174
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:32,484
to remember Cleopatra or
Muhammad Ali or Mozart...

175
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,529
let alone any of us.

176
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,525
Oblivion's inevitable.

177
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,848
And if that scares you, then
I suggest you ignore it.

178
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:44,004
God knows it's what
everyone else does.

179
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,370
Well, that's some good advice.

180
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,688
And I like all this because it's
really nice to hear everybody...

181
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,684
Thank you.
Mmm-hmm.

182
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,325
Always.
Always.

183
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,045
- Always.
- Always.

184
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,203
"Literally."

185
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,000
I thought we were
in a church basement...

186
00:10:22,024 --> 00:10:25,242
but apparently we were literally
in the heart of Jesus.

187
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,129
Oh, yeah.

188
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,647
What's your name?

189
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,405
Hazel.

190
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,210
No, what's your full name?

191
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,449
Hazel Grace Lancaster.

192
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,201
What?

193
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,361
I didn't say anything.

194
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,408
Why are you looking
at me like that?

195
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,085
Because you're beautiful.

196
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,327
Oh, my God.

197
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,528
I enjoy looking
at beautiful people.

198
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,880
See, I decided a while back...

199
00:10:53,904 --> 00:10:56,121
not to deny myself the simpler
pleasures of existence.

200
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,965
Particularly, as you
so astutely pointed out,

201
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,320
we're all gonna die pretty soon.

202
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,562
Okay, well, that's great.
But I am not beautiful.

203
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:03,807
Hey, Gus.

204
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:04,927
Hi, Lisa.

205
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,000
I like it when you say it first.

206
00:11:07,024 --> 00:11:08,360
I like it when you say it first.

207
00:11:08,384 --> 00:11:08,881
Okay-

208
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,366
Always.

209
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,925
Always.

210
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,570
What is with the "always"?

211
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,131
"Always" is, like, their thing.

212
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,926
They'll "always" love
each other, and whatnot.

213
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,247
They probably texted "always" to each
other 14 million times this year.

214
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,246
He's got to be hurting her boob.

215
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,485
Let's go watch a movie.

216
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,971
What?
Hmm?

217
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,281
Huh?

218
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,967
Um...

219
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,649
I'm free later this week,
we could...

220
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,285
No, I mean now.

221
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,645
You could be an axe murderer.

222
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,683
There's always that possibility.

223
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,088
Come on, Hazel Grace.
Take a risk.

224
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,287
I don't...

225
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,681
Really?

226
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,961
That is disgusting.

227
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,521
What?

228
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,967
What, do you think that
that's cool or something?

229
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,400
You just ruined
this whole thing.

230
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,130
The whole thing?
Yes, this whole thing!

231
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,606
Oh, man.

232
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,803
Ugh. And you were
doing really well, too.

233
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:08,965
God! There's always
a hamartia, isn't there?

234
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,322
And yours is even though
you had freaking cancer...

235
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,360
you're willing to give
money to a corporation...

236
00:12:13,384 --> 00:12:15,591
for the chance to acquire
even more cancer?

237
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:18,645
Let me just tell you that not
being able to breathe sucks!

238
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,330
It totally sucks.

239
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,641
"Hamartia"?

240
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,365
It's a fatal flaw.

241
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,045
Ah, a fatal...

242
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,321
Hazel Grace,

243
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,400
they don't actually hurt
you unless you light them.

244
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,201
Hmm?

245
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,130
I've never lit one.

246
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,166
It's a metaphor, see?

247
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:38,483
You put the thing that does the
killing right between your teeth...

248
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:42,121
but you never give it
the power to kill you.

249
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,486
A metaphor.

250
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:52,051
Hey, sweetheart.
Is it Top <i>Model</i> time?

251
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,324
No. Uh...

252
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,170
I've made plans
with Augustus Waters.

253
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,764
Whoa!

254
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,480
Oh, my God.

255
00:13:06,504 --> 00:13:07,646
Ooh!

256
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,769
Yeah, I failed my test
a couple times.

257
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,326
You don't say.

258
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,200
Actually, the fourth time
I took the test,

259
00:13:13,224 --> 00:13:14,714
it was going about
how this is going.

260
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,844
And when it was over...

261
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,207
the instructor looks over
at me, and she says...

262
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:22,768
"Your driving, while unpleasant,
is not technically unsafe."

263
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,081
Cancer perk.

264
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,889
Total cancer perk.

265
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,722
So, tell me about you.

266
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,891
Um, I was 13 when they found it.

267
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,887
<i>Pretty much
worst-case scenario.</i>

268
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,522
<i>Thyroid, stage four.</i>

269
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:39,761
<i>Not much they could do.</i>

270
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,243
<i>Which didn't stop them,
of course.</i>

271
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,361
<i>Surgery-</i>

272
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,766
<i>Radiation.</i>

273
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,241
<i>Chemo.</i>

274
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,926
<i>More radiation.</i>

275
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,248
<i>All of which worked for a while.</i>

276
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,971
<i>But, then stopped working.</i>

277
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:01,250
<i>And then one day, my lungs
started filling up with water.</i>

278
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,442
Nurse!
We need a nurse right now!

279
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,806
<i>I couldn't breathe.</i>

280
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,042
<i>No one could get it
under control.</i>

281
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,449
You can let go, sweetie.

282
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,400
Don't be afraid.

283
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,160
<i>That should have been the end.</i>

284
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,965
Oh, my God.

285
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,164
<i>But then something
strange happened.</i>

286
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,969
<i>The antibiotics kicked in.</i>

287
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,202
<i>They drained the fluid
from my lungs.</i>

288
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,406
<i>I got some strength back.</i>

289
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:27,808
<i>Next thing I know, I found
myself in an experimental trial.</i>

290
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,371
<i>You know, the ones
that are famous</i>

291
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,284
<i>in the Republic of
Cancervania for not working.</i>

292
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,805
<i>It's called Phalanxifor.</i>

293
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,803
<i>It didn't work in over
70% of the patients...</i>

294
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,406
<i>but for some reason
it's been working for me.</i>

295
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,125
So, they called it
"The Miracle."

296
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,160
Of course, my lungs still
suck at being lungs...

297
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:44,711
but, theoretically, they could
continue to suck like this...

298
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:46,961
for, I don't know,
a while maybe.

299
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,970
So, are you back in school?

300
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,920
I got my GED, so I'm
taking classes at MCC.

301
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,441
Whoa! A college girl!

302
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,001
Well, that explains
the aura of sophistication.

303
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,081
Oh! Careful!

304
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,521
Oops.

305
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:11,446
Welcome to my humble abode.

306
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,488
Uh, my folks call them
"encouragements."

307
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,081
Don't ask.

308
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,161
Hi, guys!

309
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,130
Hey!
Augustus, hi.

310
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,845
New friend?

311
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,521
Yeah.
This is Hazel Grace.

312
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,011
Hey. Oh,
it's just "Hazel."

313
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,800
How's it going, "Just Hazel"?

314
00:15:36,824 --> 00:15:38,044
Hi, Hazel, how are you?

315
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,049
Yeah, we're going
downstairs. Bye.

316
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,200
Nice to meet you, too.

317
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,486
This is it.

318
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,802
Augusto World.

319
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,121
This is my room.

320
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,725
Wow.

321
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,882
It's an impressive collection.

322
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,166
Yeah, I used to play.

323
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,330
Do you mind if I sit down?

324
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,522
Yeah. Make yourself
at home.

325
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:10,200
<i>Mi casa es tu</i> casa.

326
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,211
Sorry, the, um, stairs...

327
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,644
...and the standing...

328
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,402
Yeah, I understand.

329
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:24,846
Seriously, are you okay?

330
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,206
Yeah, yeah.

331
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:29,011
All right.
What's your story?

332
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,163
I already told you.

333
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,083
I was diagnosed when I was 13...

334
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,560
No, no, no. Not your cancer
story, your real story.

335
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,250
Your interests, your hobbies,

336
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,731
your passions,
your weird fetishes.

337
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,241
"Weird fetishes"?

338
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,720
Think of something. The first
thing that pops in your head.

339
00:16:44,744 --> 00:16:45,791
Something you love.

340
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,771
<i>An Imperial Affliction.</i>

341
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:51,765
Okay. What's that?

342
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,046
It's a novel.

343
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,924
It's my favorite novel.

344
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,003
Wait, does it have
zombies in it?

345
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,201
Zombies? No!

346
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,520
Stormtroopers?

347
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,411
No, it's not that
kind of a book.

348
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,364
Okay, what's it about?

349
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,120
Uh, cancer.

350
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,241
It's about cancer?

351
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,246
But not like that.
Trust me, it's amazing.

352
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,131
The author, his name
is Peter Van Houten.

353
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,920
He's the only person I've ever
come across in my life...

354
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:21,402
who, A, understands what
it's like to be dying...

355
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,762
but, B, hasn't actually died.

356
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,285
Okay-

357
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,960
I will read this horrible book
with this very boring title...

358
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:30,646
that does not include
zombies or Stormtroopers.

359
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,131
And in exchange...

360
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,804
...you will read this.

361
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,200
This haunting,

362
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,601
yet brilliant novelization
of my favorite video game.

363
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,164
<i>"Counterinsurgence."</i>

364
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,802
Yeah, don't laugh.
It's awesome.

365
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,480
It's about honor, and sacrifice,
and bravery, and heroism.

366
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,887
It's about embracing
your destiny,

367
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,246
and leaving a mark on the world.

368
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,324
Well, thank you.

369
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,642
Wait, your hands are so cold.

370
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:06,088
Well, they're not so much cold
as just under-oxygenated.

371
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,845
Hazel Grace?
Hmm?

372
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,804
I love it when you
talk medical to me.

373
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,521
That's different.

374
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,967
Did he give it to you?

375
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,205
By "it," do you mean herpes?

376
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,286
Wow.

377
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,646
Yes, I did.

378
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,529
It's a mother's dream.

379
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,881
Hey, don't worry.

380
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,724
Oh, my God, Mom.
I'm not worried.

381
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,041
It's not a big deal.

382
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,561
Yeah.

383
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:57,008
We just hung out, it's not like
I'm waiting for him to call me.

384
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,360
<i>- Is that</i> what... <i>?</i>
Yeah-

385
00:19:38,439 --> 00:19:40,239
Because I thought
those were peppers.

386
00:19:40,263 --> 00:19:42,206
Today, in China,

387
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,440
International Goji Berry Day.

388
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,081
Isn't that great?

389
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,446
I like the color.

390
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,601
Mmm-hmm.

391
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,523
This is the dry.
Uh-huh. Very good.

392
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,410
They're good, right?
Mmm-hmm.

393
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,728
So, do they eat a lot of goji
berries on Goji Berry Day?

394
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:02,442
I did something
with the dessert...

395
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:05,729
just to try to keep
the goji berry theme going.

396
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,609
Because they're
an amazing antioxidant.

397
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:13,961
Well, I like it.

398
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,570
We should do it every year.

399
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,240
Every year.
We should do it every year.

400
00:20:17,264 --> 00:20:17,961
I know.

401
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,769
I really do like these.

402
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,489
Honey, would you like
to be excused?

403
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,801
What?

404
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,809
Hazel Grace.

405
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,163
<i>Welcome</i> to <i>the sweet torture of
reading An Imperial Affliction.</i>

406
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,607
<i>But now I'm
breaking all the rules!</i>

407
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,171
Are you okay?

408
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,243
<i>And now
I'm breaking all the rules</i>

409
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,846
Uh... Me? Yeah,
I am excellent.

410
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,162
I am, however,
with Isaac, and...

411
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,844
Isaac, does Support Group Hazel
make this better or worse?

412
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,364
<i>I've been wasting all my time</i>

413
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,005
Isaac! Focus on me.

414
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,286
<i>Been wasting all my time</i>

415
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,369
How fast can you get here?

416
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,761
Um...

417
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,080
<i>Great. Well,
the door's open.</i>

418
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,486
I gotta run. Bye.

419
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,164
Hello?

420
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,049
Hazel.

421
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,160
Isaac, Hazel Grace from the
Support Group is here.

422
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,241
- Hi.
- Hi.

423
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:22,522
Uh...
A gentle reminder...

424
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,041
Isaac's in the midst of a
psychotic episode right now.

425
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,486
You look really nice,
by the way.

426
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,681
I like this color on you.

427
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,285
Thank you.

428
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,805
Isaac.

429
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,280
Isaac, Hazel's here.

430
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,846
Hey, Isaac.

431
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,843
Hey, Hazel.

432
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:48,721
How you doing?

433
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,451
I'm doing okay.

434
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:54,364
It seems Isaac and Monica are
no longer a going concern.

435
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,880
Oh, Isaac, I'm so sorry.

436
00:21:56,904 --> 00:21:58,064
Do you want to talk about it?

437
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:01,249
No, I just want to cry
and play video games.

438
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,440
However, you know, it doesn't
hurt to talk to him...

439
00:22:04,464 --> 00:22:07,528
if you have any sage words
of feminine advice.

440
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:10,690
I actually think that his
response is fairly appropriate.

441
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,410
"Pain demands to be felt."

442
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,090
You're quoting my book.

443
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:18,526
She said she wanted to break up
with me before the surgery...

444
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,921
because she couldn't handle it.

445
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:24,721
I'm about to lose my eyesight,
and she can't handle it.

446
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,401
I kept saying "always" to her.
Like, "Always."

447
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:29,927
And she kept talking over me

448
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,002
and not saying it back, and...

449
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:36,287
It was like I was gone
already, you know?

450
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,726
You know, sometimes...

451
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:40,042
people don't understand
the promises

452
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:42,248
that they're making
when they make them.

453
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,401
I know, but...

454
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,050
I feel like such a loser.

455
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,281
I still have her necklace on.

456
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,566
Take it off.

457
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:49,966
Dude, take that off.

458
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,610
Yeah.

459
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,205
Here we go, man.
Here we go.

460
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,123
I just want to kick something.

461
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,730
Don't hit that, don't hit that.

462
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,241
Uh...

463
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,805
Hit this.
Sorry.

464
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,410
I've been wanting to call
you for a few days now...

465
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,120
but I've been waiting
until I could form

466
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:18,040
a coherent thought about
An Imperial Affliction.

467
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,047
One second.

468
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,281
Isaac.

469
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,520
Pillows don't break.

470
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,484
You need to break something.

471
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,125
Try this.

472
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,769
The trophy?
Yeah.

473
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:33,841
Are you sure?

474
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:36,760
I've been looking for a way to tell
my father I kind of hate basketball.

475
00:23:36,784 --> 00:23:38,354
Go to town!

476
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,011
Always!

477
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:47,851
<i>An Imperial Affliction.</i>

478
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,809
Yes. I'm so glad
that you liked it.

479
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,525
Yes, I did.
But the ending.

480
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,205
I know.
It is rather abrupt.

481
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:56,601
"Rather abrupt"? Are you kidding?
It's evil!

482
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,649
I mean, I understand
that she dies...

483
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,280
but there's an unwritten
contract between author and...

484
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,687
Gus?
Yeah?

485
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:03,841
Cool?
Sure.

486
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,490
Between author and reader.

487
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,449
And I feel like ending your book
in the middle of a sentence...

488
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,363
violates that contract,
don't you think?

489
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,601
Okay, yes.

490
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:11,727
I know what you mean...

491
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,610
but, to be completely honest,

492
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,920
I think it's just so truthful.

493
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,289
You just die in
the middle of life.

494
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,840
You die in the middle
of a sentence.

495
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,282
And, I don't know...

496
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,209
But I really would like to know

497
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:26,487
what happens to everyone
after Anna dies.

498
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:28,881
Like Anna's mother.

499
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,405
Yes, and the Dutch Tulip Man.

500
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,130
And Sisyphus the Hamster.

501
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,811
Yes!

502
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,641
Have you tried contacting
this Peter Van Houten fellow?

503
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,689
I've written him
so many letters,

504
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,250
but he's never responded.

505
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,811
Apparently, he moved
to Amsterdam

506
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,211
and became a recluse, and...

507
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,563
Shame.
Yeah.

508
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:48,921
Isaac“.

509
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:51,208
You feeling better, buddy?

510
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,243
That's the thing about pain.

511
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,567
It demands to be felt.

512
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,411
I'll help you clean this up.

513
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,763
Hazel Grace.

514
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:04,967
Augustus Waters.

515
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:07,560
I cannot stop thinking
about this goddamn book.

516
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,882
You're welcome.

517
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,760
However, we do need closure,
don't you think?

518
00:25:11,784 --> 00:25:13,370
That is exactly
what I was asking

519
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,726
Van Houten for in my letters.

520
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,285
But he never responded.

521
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:18,205
Um, nope.

522
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,125
"Dear Mr. Waters...

523
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:24,449
"I am writing to thank you for
your electronic correspondence.

524
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,600
"I am grateful to anyone
who sets aside the time...

525
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,091
<i>"to read my book."</i>

526
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,446
Augustus?

527
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,761
<i>Yes?</i>

528
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:32,801
What are you doing?

529
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:33,961
<i>I may have found...</i>

530
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:36,327
Van Houten's assistant,
emailed her.

531
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,290
Augustus! She may have forwarded
that email on to Van Houten.

532
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,441
<i>Shall I continue?</i>

533
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,244
Oh, my God.
Yeah, go, go, go!

534
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,728
"I am particularly
indebted to you, sir."

535
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,645
Hazel Grace,
he just called me "sir."

536
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:50,246
Augustus, keep reading,

537

"Both for your kind words about
An Imperial Affliction...

your friend Hazel Grace.".</i>

541
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,730
<i>You did not!
You did not!</i>

542
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:02,961
You did not, you did not!

543
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,161
<i>Of course I did.</i>

So, yeah, that just happened.

551
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,251
Oh, my God.

552
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,360
I've been trying to tell
you, I'm kind of awesome.

553
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:30,169
Do you think that I...

Oh, my God.

556
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:40,282
Oh, my God, Augustus.

557
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,329
I'm freaking out.
I'm freaking out.

558
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:44,522
<i>Dear Mr. Peter Van Houten,</i>

559
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,762
<i>my name is Hazel
Grace Lancaster.</i>

560
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,445
<i>My friend Augustus Waters...</i>

561
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,171
<i>who read your book
at my recommendation...</i>

562
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:53,766
<i>just received an email
from you at this address.</i>

563
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:57,009
<i>I hope you will not mind that
he shared that email with me.</i>

564
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,441
<i>I was wondering if you wouldn't mind
answering a few questions I have...</i>

565
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,522
<i>about what happens
after the end of the book.</i>

566
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,530
<i>Specifically the following.</i>

567
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:06,291
<i>Does Anna's mom marry
the Dutch Tulip Man?</i>

568
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,760
<i>And is the Dutch Tulip Man
up to something...</i>

569
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,365
<i>or is he just
completely misunderstood?</i>

570
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:15,969
<i>Lastly, I was hoping you could shed
some light on Sisyphus the Hamster.</i>

571
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:18,691
<i>These questions have
haunted me for years...</i>

572
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:22,367
<i>and I don't know how long I have
left to get answers to them.</i>

573
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:24,760
<i>I know that these are not
important literary questions...</i>

574
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,888
"and that your book is full of
important literary questions...

575
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,650
"but I would just
really like to know.

576
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:31,320

decide to write anything else...</i>

577
00:27:31,344 --> 00:27:32,525

578
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:35,001
"Frankly, I'd read
your grocery lists.

00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:38,084
"Yours, with great admiration,
Hazel Grace Lancaster."

580
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,924
<i>Not bad.</i>

581
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,161
You think?

582
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:43,083
Yeah, I mean,
it's a bit pretentious...

583
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:46,006
<i>but then again, Van Houten
uses words like "tendentious"</i>

584
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,923
and "Bacchanalia, <i>"</i> so...

585
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,570
I think he'll like it.

586
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,408
Is it really 1:00 AM?

587
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,521
<i>Is it?</i>

588
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,841
Yeah, I guess it is.

589
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:05,445
I should probably go to sleep.

590
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,122
Okay-

591
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,125
Okay-

592
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,604
Okay-

593
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,451
Okay-

594
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:27,045
Perhaps "okay"
will be our "always."

595
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,049
Okay-

596
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,171
Oh, my God.

597
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:13,167
"Dear Ms. Lancaster...

598
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:15,640
"I cannot answer your questions,

599
00:29:15,664 --> 00:29:17,800

00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,330

"Yours most sincerely,

607
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,167
Oh, my God!

608
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,367
What is this life?

609
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,284
Hazel?

610
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,441
Mom!
Hazel, what's wrong?

611
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:43,841
Mom, look at this.

612
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,048
Come here.
Come here, come here.

613
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,886
Look.

614
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,441
What?
Yeah.

615
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:51,726
Peter Van Houten!

616
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:53,881
Look what he said!

617
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:56,202
"Should ever you find
yourself in Amsterdam"!

618
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:57,361
I have to go!

619
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:58,641
That's incredible.

620
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,290
He invited us to Amsterdam.

621
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,401
Amsterdam!

622
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:03,562
Wow!
Can We go?

623
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:06,121
I mean, do you think
we could actually go?

624
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:07,887
I mean, Amsterdam!

625
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:10,725
I want you to have everything
you want in the world.

626
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,882
But we don't have
the money, you know?

627
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:15,368
Just getting all the
equipment over there.

628
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,010
How do we do that?

629
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:19,891
Yeah, duh. I'm sorry.

630
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:29,484
Hey, you, I am so sorry.

631
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:33,330
It's okay.

632
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,281
Why don't you just ask the Genies?
Use your wish.

633
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,204
I already used it.
Pre-Miracle.

634
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,771
What'd you use it on?

635
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,969
Not Disney.

636
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:06,611
Hazel Grace, you did not
go to Disney World.

637
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,962
You did not use your last dying wish...
I was 13.

638
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,246
...to go to Disney World.

639
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,561
And Epcot Center.

640
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:12,806
Oh, my God.

641
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,450
It was actually
a really fun trip!

642
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,240
That's the saddest thing
I've ever heard.

643
00:31:16,264 --> 00:31:16,921
I met Goofy!

644
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:18,206
Now I'm just embarrassed.

645
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:19,281
Why are you embarrassed?

646
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:22,723
I can't believe I have a crush on
a girl with such cliche wishes.

647
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,964
Terrible.

648
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,606
You coming?

649
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,526
<i>The most important
thing in any MRI...</i>

650
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,808
<i>is to lie completely still.</i>

651
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:41,684
<i>But that day,
it was almost impossible.</i>

652
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,410
Hey, Gus!
How are you?

653
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,005
Hi, Mrs. Lancaster.

654
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:03,000
Hey. Rik Smits jersey?

655
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,600
Yeah, it is indeed.
I loved that guy.

656
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:05,641
I'm Augustus Waters.

657
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,689
Nice to meet you.
I'm Michael.

658
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,209
It's good to see you.
Hi, Mrs. Lancaster.

659
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:14,442
Good to see you.

660
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,165
Hi, Hazel Grace.

661
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,606
Hi.

662
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,162
How would you like to go
on a picnic with me?

663
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:27,208
Um, I would love to go
on a picnic with you.

664
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,005
Shall we?

665
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:33,208
No.
Let me...

666
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:37,285
I smell like hospital,
so I should just change.

667
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:45,761
So, uh...

668
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:48,731
you're a survivor yourself, huh?

669
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:49,801
Yeah.

670
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,803
I didn't cut this fellow
off for the hell of it.

671
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:57,050
Although it does make an
excellent weight-loss strategy.

672
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,765
Legs are very heavy.

673
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,804
How's your health now?

674
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,321
It's great.
NEC for 14 months.

675
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,447
Really?
Yeah.

676
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:07,010
That's fantastic.
Yeah.

677
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:09,164
I'm very lucky.

678
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:16,841
Hey, listen, Gus.

679
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:23,965
You have to understand,
Hazel's still pretty sick.

680
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:27,765
And she will be
the rest of her life.

681
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,520
And she's gonna want to
keep up with you.

682
00:33:29,709 --> 00:33:31,869
She's that kind of girl. But
the truth is, her lungs...

683
00:33:31,893 --> 00:33:32,893
Ready, Gus?

684
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:34,561
Yeah.

685
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:39,570
All right.
See you soon.

686
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:40,960
All right.

687
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:44,887
Oh!

688
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,243
Such a beautiful day.

689
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,361
Yeah.

690
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,761
Is this where you take all
of your romantic conquests?

691
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,450
Every last one of them.

692
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:55,121
That's probably why
I'm still a virgin.

693
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:59,202
You are not still a virgin.

694
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,081
Are you really?

695
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,571
Let me show you something.

696
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:09,651
See this circle?

697
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,404
That is a circle of virgins.

698
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:16,641
Uh-huh.

699
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:20,811
And this...

700
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:25,122
is 18-year-old dudes
with one leg.

701
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,524
Oh...
So, yeah.

702
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:37,850
<i>Funky Bones by
Jeep Van Lieshout.</i>

703
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:41,966
He sounds quite Dutch.

704
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,201
And he is.

705
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:45,124
Much like Rik Smits.

706
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,009
And tulips.

707
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,001
Sandwich?

708
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,401
Let me guess.

709
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,608
Dutch cheese and tomato.

710
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,084
Sorry, the tomatoes are Mexican.

711
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:58,290
How dare you!

712
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,001
Hmm.

713
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:03,162
How cool is this?

714
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:05,687
They're using a skeleton
as a playground.

715
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,410
Think about that.

716
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,725
You do love your symbols.

717
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,760
Speaking of which,
you're probably wondering...

718
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:15,080
why you're sitting here eating
a bad cheese sandwich...

719
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:17,440
and drinking orange juice with
a guy in a Rik Smits jersey.

720
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:19,528
It actually has crossed my mind.

721
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:22,281
Well, Hazel Grace,
like so many before you...

722
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:25,489
and listen, I say this with
the utmost of affection...

723
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,725
you used your wish moronically.

724
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,809
Okay, we've been through this.
I was 13.

725
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:32,770
Hush! lam in the midst
of a grand soliloquy, here.

726
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:35,003
You were young,
impressionable...

727
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:37,040
the Grim Reaper staring
you right in the face...

728
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:40,090
and it led you to rush into making
a wish you didn't really want.

729
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,970
But, how could
little Hazel Grace,

730
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,720
having never read
An Imperial Affliction...

731
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:47,082
know that her one true wish was
to visit Mr. Peter Van Houten...

732
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:49,083
in his Amsterdam exile.

733
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,721
But I didn't save it, so...

734
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:56,361
It's a good thing I saved mine.

735
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:00,770
So, you're saying...

736
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:03,207
I'm not gonna give you my
wish or anything, Hazel.

737
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,885
If that's what you're thinking.

738
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,041
However...

739
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:11,408
I, too, have an interest in meeting
this Mr. Peter Van Houten...

740
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:13,931
and I don't really think
it would make much sense...

741
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,161
to meet him without the
girl who introduced me

742
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:16,520
to the book
in the first place...

743
00:36:16,544 --> 00:36:17,601
now, would it?

744
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,400
So I talked to the Genies,
and they're all for it.

745
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,450
We leave in a month.

746
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:24,961
No.

747
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,486
Mmm-hmm.

748
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,367
Oh, my God.

749
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:31,965
Oh, my God!

750
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:33,565
Augustus!

751
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,969
Thank you!

752
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,961
Apparently, they... I don't know
if they do this that often,

753
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:43,801
but they're willing to
bring me, too, and...

754
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,730
That's incredible.

755
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,405
Hazel, that's so beautiful.

756
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:48,721
I know.

757
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,524
And a little insane.

758
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:53,286
Oh, it's super insane. It's...
It's... It's... It's crazy!

759
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,487
Well...
It's Amsterdam!

760
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:55,846
He just met you...

761
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:58,201
I know! ...and he's
giving you his wish.

762
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:02,405
Well, we're sharing the wish. We're... I
mean, he... He... Yeah. We're sharing it.

763
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,131
That's sweet.

764
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,731
Unless...

765
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,200
What?

766
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,962
Is he your boyfriend?
Is that...

767
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:13,003
Stop it! Do not...
He is not my...

768
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:14,720
Mom, focus,
we're talking about Amsterdam.

769
00:37:14,744 --> 00:37:17,395
I like him so much. I...
Stop.

770
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:20,001
Pay attention.
Please! Can I go?

771
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:23,289
Right, as your mom,
I love this idea.

772
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:29,966
And I... I think we
should talk to Dr. Maria.

773
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:32,961
Okay-

774
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:34,561
I don't know.

775
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:35,920
But you said that
the PET scan was encouraging.

776
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:37,769
Well, the PET scan
is encouraging,

777
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:40,047
but we don't know how long
it will stay that way.

778
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:43,642
Okay, I'm not seeking political asylum.
It's a few days. It's a vacation!

779
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,205
It's true.
What if you get sick?

780
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,765
In a foreign country?

781
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:49,844
They have doctors in
Amsterdam. And cancer.

782
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,766
Well, not all cancers are alike, and
yours is particularly unusual, Hazel.

783
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,402
The only way I could ever
authorize a trip like this

784
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,648
would be if someone
familiar with your case...

785
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,410
What if my mom came?

786
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,370
Wait, what?

787
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,125
What if you came?

788
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:07,766
I'm... I'm sure the Genies would
hook it up. They're loaded.

789
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,723
That just might work.

790
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,724
<i>HAZEL".
And then this happened.</i>

791
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,406
Hey-

792
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:03,801
Hi.

793
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,568
Hey.
You're okay.

794
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,370
So, what happened?

795
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,488
The usual.

796
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:14,644
Fluid in the lungs
preventing oxygenation.

797
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,802
They put a tube in.

798
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,240
They drained a liter
and a half last night.

799
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,050
The good news is...

800
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:24,043
no tumor growth.

801
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,964
No new tumors in your body.

802
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:28,809
We're so relieved.

803
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:31,725
This is just a thing, Hazel.

804
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:34,851
It's a thing we can live with.

805
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,162
Mr. Lancaster.

806
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,481
How's she doing?

807
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:44,727
Better.

808
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:47,122
Yeah, thank you.
Much, much better.

809
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,851
Uh, they won't let me in.
It's family only.

810
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,411
Yeah, sorry.

811
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,489
Yeah, I get it.

812
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:54,926
Um...

813
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,325
Could you just
tell her I was here?

814
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:59,802
Yeah, of course.
Of course I will.

815
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,209
Okay. Gus, listen, why
don't you go home?

816
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,243
Get some rest.

817
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,004
Okay-

818
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,760
Normally, the tumors
start resisting the treatment...

819
00:40:16,784 --> 00:40:18,548
and that hasn't happened here...

820
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:20,171
Yet.

821
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,004
On the other hand...

822
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:25,243
the drug may be
worsening the edema.

823
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:26,361
The truth is...

824
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:30,047
very few people have been on
Phalanxifor as long as Hazel has.

825
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:31,960
We really don't know
the long-term effects.

826
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:34,407
What we're trying to do is
prevent endothelial growth...

827
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:40,044
which, when overexpressed, can
contribute to disease, decay...

828
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,565
vascular inhibition...

829
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:44,200
and the spread of the tumors

830
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:46,681
we're working so hard
to eradicate.

831
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:49,451
The survival rate of patients
with severe endothelial growth...

832
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:53,286
decreases exponentially the
more the condition advances.

833
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:56,887
You can let go, sweetie.

834
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:58,966
Don't be afraid.

835
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:02,605
Oh, my God.

836
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:07,607
I'm not gonna be a mom anymore.

837
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:14,521
I have a question.

838
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:17,730
Yes, Hazel?

839
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,484
Can I still go to Amsterdam?

840
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:22,211
That would not be wise
at this juncture.

841
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:24,681
Why not? ls there any way we
can make that trip happen?

842
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:27,240
It would increase some risks.

843
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:29,164
But so does going to the mall.

844
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:30,810
Yes, but an airplane?

845
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,769
But they have oxygen
on airplanes.

846
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:34,046
You're stage four.

847
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,487
This is an opportunity
that I may never get again.

848
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:38,287
Even

849
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,243
If the medication is working, I
don't understand why I can't...

850
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:41,481
Perhaps there's a scenario...

851
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:42,647
No.

852
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:46,449
I don't know any other
way to say this, Hazel.

853
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:47,681
You're just too sick.

854
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,689
I'm sorry.

855
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:35,326
MICHAEL; Hello?

856
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:37,689
Yeah, just a sec.

857
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:41,490
Hi. Gus... again.

858
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:45,804
Sorry, she's asleep.

859
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:47,440
Yeah. Uh, okay.

860
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:50,249
All right. Bye-bye.

861
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:56,560
I know what you're thinking.

862
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,164
It's not fair to him.

863
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:01,441
It's not.

864
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:03,923
He doesn't need this
in his life.

865
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:05,411
Nobody does.

866
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:07,329
A lot more trouble
than it's worth.

867
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:09,371
No, you're right.

868
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:12,727
Your mom and I were just
saying the same thing.

869
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:15,724
I mean, it could be time we
tossed you out on the street.

870
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:19,883
Drop you off in an orphanage
somewhere, make you their problem.

871
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:21,887
I'm serious.

872
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:25,687
We're not sentimental people.

873
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:21,483
Hazel Grace.

874
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:25,282
Hi, Augustus.

875
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:27,807
<i>Are you okay?</i>

876
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:37,326
No.

877
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:40,643
<i>What's the matter?</i>

878
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:43,205
<i>Talk to me.</i>

879
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:46,284
I don't know.

880
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:51,129
Everything.

881
00:44:57,560 --> 00:45:00,689
I want to go to Amsterdam, Gus.

882
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:02,160
And I want Van Houten to tell us

883
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:04,282
what happens after his book.

884
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:13,043
I also don't really want
this particular life.

885
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:19,760
I mean, it's really
just the sky.

886
00:45:19,839 --> 00:45:20,886
The sky is making me sad.

887
00:45:21,039 --> 00:45:23,650
And there's this pathetic
old swing set...

888
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:27,361
that my dad built for me when
I was a kid and...

889
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:33,241
It's just everything, I guess.

890
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:38,042
<i>Well, I demand to see this
swing set of tears.</i>

891
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:41,651
I do see your point.

892
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:44,241
This is one sad swing set.

893
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,162
Hazel Grace,
I hope you realize...

894
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:54,200
that you trying to
keep your distance from me

895
00:45:54,224 --> 00:45:56,963
in no way lessens
my affection for you.

896
00:45:57,120 --> 00:46:00,761
All your efforts to keep me
from you are gonna fail.

897
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:02,850
Look. Uh...

898
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:06,091
I like you.

899
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:10,609
And I like hanging out
with you and everything...

900
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:13,730
but I can't let this
go on any further.

901
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,001
Why not?

902
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:17,925
Because I don't
want to hurt you.

903
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:19,411
I wouldn't mind.

904
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:21,200
No, you don't understand.
I do understand.

905
00:46:21,224 --> 00:46:22,127
You don't understand.

906
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:23,486
I know what
you're trying to say.

907
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:25,802
Hazel, I'm saying
I wouldn't mind.

908
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:28,566
It'd be a privilege to have
my heart broken by you.

909
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:30,728
Gus, I'm a grenade.

910
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:36,686
One day I'm gonna explode...

911
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:39,207
and I'm gonna obliterate
everything in my wake and...

912
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:42,882
I don't know, I feel like
it's my responsibility...

913
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:44,883
to minimize the casualties.

914
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:49,809
A grenade?

915
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:54,360
I mean, that's why I
don't have a hamster.

916
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:09,410
Well, we gotta do something
about this frickin' swing set.

917
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:14,601
Okay-

918
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:18,530
"Swing set needs home."

919
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:29,050
"Desperately lonely swing set

920
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:33,129
"needs loving home."

921
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:46,889
"Lonely, vaguely
pedophilia swing set

922
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:51,086
"seeks the butts of children."

923
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:55,521
No. No.

924
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:56,841
No? No?

925
00:47:57,120 --> 00:47:58,963
I like it.

926
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:01,120
That's why.

927
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:05,763
In case you're wondering, that's
why I like you, Hazel Grace.

928
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:08,881
You're just so busy
being you, you have

929
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,480
no idea how utterly
unprecedented you are.

930
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:17,645
You can't say stuff like that.

931
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:19,529
What? That's howl
speak to all my friends.

932
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:23,760
I know, I know. Friends.

933
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:27,682
Friends.

934
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:30,004
Friends!

935
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:31,884
You can't do that!

936
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:30,170
"Dear Hazel, received word via
the Genies that you will...

937
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:33,400
"you'll be visiting us
with Augustus Waters

938
00:49:33,424 --> 00:49:35,347
"and your mother
on the fourth."

939
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:39,691
Mom?

940
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:41,126
Yeah?

941
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:42,611
Mom!

942
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:45,764
What's wrong? Sorry.

943
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:47,610
No, I was just taking a bath.

944
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:51,207
Did you email the Genies to tell
them that the trip was off?

945
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:53,280
Because Van Houten's
assistant just emailed me...

946
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:56,130
and she said that she
thinks we're still coming.

947
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:00,206
What?

948
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:04,204
I was supposed to tell you
with your dad.

949
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:05,721
Mom.

950
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:07,644
We're going to Amsterdam.

951
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:11,245
You're se-...
We're going to Amsterdam?

952
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:13,010
We're going to Amsterdam.

953
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:15,401
We figured the whole thing out.
We're going.

954
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:17,881
Doctor Maria, everybody knows.

955
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:20,850
But only for three days, not six.
Oh, my God.

956
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:24,123
But everything. An
oncologist is set there.

957
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:26,044
Everything.
We're just so good.

958
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:27,406
I love you.

959
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:30,687
I love you so much.

960
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:33,608
I love you.

961
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:42,920
Here, sit down.
We're going to Amsterdam.

962
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,168
We're going to Amsterdam.

963
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:53,880
We're going to Amsterdam.
You can come talk to me.

964
00:50:53,904 --> 00:50:55,184
You've got a phone call to make.

965
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:59,489
Call him!

966
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:09,922
Okay, lungs, you keep your
shit together for one week.

967
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:12,765
You got it?
One more week.

968
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:50,961
Oh. Oh, wait,
the food.

969
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:52,041
What did you forget?

970
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:54,521
Do you have my passport?

971
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:56,125
Yeah, I've got it.

972
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:08,845
It's like I said
to the Genies...

973
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,765
"I travel in style,
or I don't travel at all."

974
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:14,680
Mom, we're going to Amsterdam!

975
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:17,246
We are going to
Amsterdam, right now.

976
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:19,524
Hello, Lancasters.

977
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:23,526
Gus. Hey.
Nice to see you.

978
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:25,407
I'll take that, sir.

979
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:27,289
Gus, you're so inventive!

980
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:29,081
Okay, Hazel Grace?

981
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:31,569
Okay!

982
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:42,201
What's in your nose?

983
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:43,321
Jackie!

984
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:44,686
I'm really sorry about that.

985
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:46,040
No, it's totally fine.

986
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:48,925
It's called a "cannula."
And it helps me breathe.

987
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:50,929
See this little
friend right here?

988
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:53,481
He feeds oxygen
through your tube.

989
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:55,090
Will it help me breath, too?

990
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:57,891
Maybe. Do you want to try it?

991
00:52:58,920 --> 00:52:59,921
Okay-

992
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:04,641
Come here.

993
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:08,531
There ya go.

994
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:10,285
It tickles!

995
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:13,846
Wow, yeah, that's something.

996
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:16,284
I think I'm breathing better.

997
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:18,084
I would love to give it to you,

998
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:19,804
but I kind of
could use the help.

999
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:22,008
Thanks for letting me try it.
You're welcome.

1000
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:23,525
All right, Jackie, let's go.

1001
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:25,085
Thank you. Take care.
Bye.

1002
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:28,841
<i>Flight 1721 is now prepared to
begin boarding at gate 46...</i>

1003
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:30,724
I think that's us.
That's us.

1004
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:32,121
We are going to Amsterdam!

1005
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:33,366
Oh, my God.

1006
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:35,931
Come on, help me.

1007
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:39,131
What, are they wet?
Wet hands.

1008
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:41,240
I'm sorry about that. Gross!
Get outta here! Stop it!

1009
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,684
Have you never been
on a plane before?

1010
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:53,241
No.

1011
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:55,770
It's exciting.

1012
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,331
Sir?
Uh-huh?

1013
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:04,926
There's no smoking
on this plane.

1014
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:06,081
Or any plane.

1015
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:07,845
I don't smoke.

1016
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,684
Yeah, it's just a metaphor.

1017
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:10,966
He puts the killing thing
in his mouth...

1018
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:13,240
but he doesn't actually give
it the power to kill him.

1019
00:54:13,264 --> 00:54:15,650
Well, that metaphor, it's
prohibited on today's flight.

1020
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:18,800
<i>Flight attendants,
prepare for take off, please.</i>

1021
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,047
Thanks.

1022
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:23,081
Okay?

1023
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:27,004
Gus, this is what it's like
to drive in a car with you.

1024
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:28,570
Ha-ha-ha-ha...

1025
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:31,527
Oh...

1026
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:40,041
Oh!

1027
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:43,283
Oh, my God, we're flying.

1028
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:45,562
We're flying!

1029
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:46,807
Look at the ground!

1030
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:48,291
Look.

1031
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:51,683
Nothing has ever looked like
this in all of human history!

1032
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:54,563
Look at the cars.
They're like...

1033
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:58,284
You two are so adorable.

1034
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:00,130
We're just friends.

1035
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:02,249
Well, she is, I'm not.

1036
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:05,167
Oh, my!

1037
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:06,930
Whoa!

1038
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:24,122
<i>Get away from her, you bitch!</i>

1039
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:51,729
Look at this, Hazel.

1040
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:54,365
This is so crazy.

1041
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,650
Whoa.

1042
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:27,721
What?

1043
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:29,928
Look at the stained glass.

1044
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,002
It's amazing.

1045
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:33,850
Oh, I'm gonna check us in.

1046
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:43,290
We better get you dressed...

1047
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:45,240
because you have reservations
for two tonight,

1048
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:49,090
for dinner at Oranjee.
Oh.

1049
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:53,290
And it says, "Enjoy.
Mr. Peter Van Houten."

1050
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:56,650
So, I looked it up
and it sounds amazing.

1051
00:56:56,800 --> 00:57:00,850
The guide book says it's
fancy and very romantic.

1052
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,082
Right. Fancy...

1053
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:06,124
Oh, God.

1054
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:08,847
But, okay, what...

1055
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:12,124
...will you wear?

1056
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:14,811
Is that for me?

1057
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:23,323
Oh, my God.
It's so beautiful.

1058
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:25,124
I'm just saying.

1059
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:27,810
You're just saying?

1060
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,923
What, you're saying
that you're totally fine...

1061
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:33,402
with your teenage daughter running
free with an older boy...

1062
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:35,085
in a city that's famous
for its vice

1063
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:36,764
and debauchery is
totally fine with you?

1064
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:41,163
Yeah, that's pretty much
exactly what I'm saying.

1065
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:50,851
Gus!

1066
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:53,566
Oh, you look so handsome!

1067
00:57:54,080 --> 00:57:56,128
Thank you, ma'am.
Wow.

1068
00:57:56,320 --> 00:57:58,163
Hazel, Gus is here...

1069
00:57:58,320 --> 00:58:00,368
looking incredible!

1070
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:05,526
I hear this restaurant
is unbelievable.

1071
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:17,246
Wow.

1072
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:18,841
What?

1073
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:24,005
You look gorgeous.

1074
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:28,966
Thanks.

1075
00:58:39,560 --> 00:58:40,846
Whoa!

1076
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:52,120
Wow.

1077
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:11,886
This is it.

1078
00:59:13,240 --> 00:59:14,651
Oranjee.
Yeah, this is it.

1079
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:15,881
Oh, yeah.

1080
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:26,047
Your table,
Mr. and Mrs. Waters.

1081
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:28,160
Thank you.

1082
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:31,967
Thanks, Gus.

1083
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:33,531
You are very welcome.

1084
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:40,686
The champagne
is our gift. Enjoy.

1085
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:41,841
Thank you.

1086
00:59:42,360 --> 00:59:43,646
Good evening.

1087
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:56,761
<i>Voilà.</i>

1088
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:01,486
Okay, Okay?

1089
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:11,841
Whoa.

1090
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:16,124
That is amazing.

1091
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:17,611
Do you know what
Dom Pérignon said

1092
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:19,603
after he invented champagne?

1093
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:23,808
"Come quickly," he said.
"I'm tasting the stars."

1094
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:27,285
Welcome to Oranjee.

1095
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:30,967
Would you like a menu, or will
you have the chef's choice?

1096
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:34,161
Chef's choice sounds wonderful.

1097
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:36,602
- Mmm.
- And, sir, um...

1098
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:40,560
something tells me we're gonna
need a little bit more of this.

1099
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:42,802
We have bottled all the
stars for you this evening,

1100
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:44,370
my young friends.

1101
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:52,889
- Ooh!
- I think that's ours.

1102
01:00:54,040 --> 01:00:55,769
Dragon carrot
risotto for the lady.

1103
01:00:55,960 --> 01:00:57,371
Thank you.

1104
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:00,007
And for the gentleman.

1105
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:02,483
Thank you.
Enjoy.

1106
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:10,406
Mmm.

1107
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:16,527
I want this dragon carrot
risotto to become a person...

1108
01:01:16,680 --> 01:01:18,762
so that I can take it
to Vegas and marry it.

1109
01:01:25,560 --> 01:01:26,766
I like your suit.

1110
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:29,201
Thank you. It's the first
time I've ever worn it.

1111
01:01:29,360 --> 01:01:30,960
That's not the suit
you wear to funerals?

1112
01:01:30,984 --> 01:01:32,041
No.

1113
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:33,770
That one is not
nearly this nice.

1114
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:36,290
When I first got sick...

1115
01:01:36,680 --> 01:01:39,411
they told me I had an 85 percent
chance of being cancer-free.

1116
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:41,487
Great odds.

1117
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:44,605
But that meant a year of
torture, the loss of my leg...

1118
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:47,121
and, still, a 15 percent
chance it might fail.

1119
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:49,206
Just before the surgery...

1120
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:53,490
I asked my parents if I could
buy a really nice suit.

1121
01:01:54,120 --> 01:01:55,201
So, it's your death suit.

1122
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:56,806
That's what it is.

1123
01:01:56,960 --> 01:01:59,725
I have one of those. I got it
for my fifteenth birthday.

1124
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:01,120
A dress.

1125
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:05,321
I don't necessarily think I'd
wear it on a date, though.

1126
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:08,606
So, we're on a date?

1127
01:02:11,240 --> 01:02:13,368
Hey, you watch it.

1128
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:16,643
We are Mr.
And Mrs. Waters.

1129
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:19,400
Oh. That's just because
she can't speak English.

1130
01:02:19,424 --> 01:02:22,288
We should be, though, if they ask.
You know?

1131
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:23,800
Remember what you
said about Vegas?

1132
01:02:23,824 --> 01:02:24,824
Yeah.

1133
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:26,800
Do you think I could
join in on that deal?

1134
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:28,806
God?

1135
01:02:29,080 --> 01:02:30,206
Maybe.

1136
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:32,081
How about angels?

1137
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:33,161
Mmm, no.

1138
01:02:33,240 --> 01:02:34,605
Afterlife?
Mmm...

1139
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:35,727
No.

1140
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:37,086
Well, maybe.
I don't know.

1141
01:02:37,360 --> 01:02:39,160
I guess I wouldn't go
as far as to say "no"...

1142
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:41,811
but I would like some evidence.

1143
01:02:43,160 --> 01:02:44,605
What about you?

1144
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:46,809
Absolutely.
Really?

1145
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:49,611
I mean, not like a heaven where
you ride on a unicorn all day...

1146
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:51,842
and live in a mansion
made of clouds...

1147
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:55,209
but yes, I definitely
believe in something.

1148
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:57,444
I mean, otherwise...

1149
01:02:57,600 --> 01:02:59,284
what's the point?

1150
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:03,048
Maybe there is no point.

1151
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:04,925
I won't accept that.

1152
01:03:10,760 --> 01:03:12,922
I am in love with you.

1153
01:03:16,080 --> 01:03:17,366
You heard me.

1154
01:03:22,360 --> 01:03:23,361
Augustus...

1155
01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:24,925
I am in love with you.

1156
01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:27,800
And I know that love is just
a shout into the void...

1157
01:03:27,824 --> 01:03:29,210
and that oblivion is inevitable.

1158
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:30,850
And that we're all doomed...

1159
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,731
and that one day...

1160
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:37,290
all of our labors
will be returned to dust.

1161
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:41,202
And I know that
the sun will swallow

1162
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:43,282
the only Earth
we will ever have.

1163
01:03:43,840 --> 01:03:45,569
And I am in love with you.

1164
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:50,486
Sorry.

1165
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:03,161
More stars?

1166
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:05,401
No, thank you.

1167
01:04:05,560 --> 01:04:07,642
I think we'll just
have the check.

1168
01:04:07,800 --> 01:04:08,926
No, sir.

1169
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,571
Your meal has been paid
by Mr. Van Houten.

1170
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:18,365
What?

1171
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:11,561
I don't really get that shirt.

1172
01:05:11,640 --> 01:05:12,846
Mmm.

1173
01:05:13,120 --> 01:05:15,168
But Van Houten will get it.

1174
01:05:15,400 --> 01:05:18,961
There are, like, fifty Magritte
references in An Imperial Affliction.

1175
01:05:19,120 --> 01:05:21,361
"This is not a pipe."

1176
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:22,761
But it is a pipe.

1177
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:24,286
But it's not.

1178
01:05:25,240 --> 01:05:26,685
It is a drawing of a pipe.

1179
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:27,841
See?

1180
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:30,209
A drawing of a thing
is not the thing itself.

1181
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:34,564
Nor is a T-shirt of a drawing
of a thing, the thing itself.

1182
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:35,721
Hey, you.

1183
01:05:35,880 --> 01:05:37,723
When did you get so grown up?

1184
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:44,165
Who's ready for some answers?

1185
01:05:45,080 --> 01:05:46,445
Me!

1186
01:06:10,320 --> 01:06:11,401
This is it.

1187
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:14,087
I'm so excited,
I can barely breathe.

1188
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:16,325
As opposed to normal?

1189
01:06:17,040 --> 01:06:18,883
Get out of here.

1190
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:26,564
Lidewij?

1191
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:30,645
Hi!
Hi, I'm Augustus.

1192
01:06:32,080 --> 01:06:34,367
Lidewij.
Hazel.

1193
01:06:34,520 --> 01:06:35,601
Please, come in.

1194
01:06:35,800 --> 01:06:36,801
Thank you.

1195
01:06:37,480 --> 01:06:39,050
Peter! They're here!

1196
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:41,248
Who the hell is "they," Lidewij?

1197
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:45,243
They are Augustus and Hazel...

1198
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:47,400
the young fans with whom
you've been corresponding.

1199
01:06:48,120 --> 01:06:49,406
The Americans?

1200
01:06:49,560 --> 01:06:51,050
You invited them.

1201
01:06:52,200 --> 01:06:53,690
Please, come in.

1202
01:06:53,840 --> 01:06:55,760
You know
why I left America, Lidewij.

1203
01:06:57,240 --> 01:06:59,766
To never have to
encounter Americans.

1204
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:02,330
You're American.

1205
01:07:02,920 --> 01:07:04,206
Incurably so.

1206
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:05,811
Get rid of them.

1207
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:08,723
I will not do this, Peter.

1208
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:10,770
Please, be nice.

1209
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:12,884
Come in, please.

1210
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:23,804
Sorry, let me
clear this for you.

1211
01:07:27,640 --> 01:07:28,926
Thank you.

1212
01:07:33,120 --> 01:07:35,646
Which of you is Augustus Waters?

1213
01:07:36,200 --> 01:07:37,247
I am.

1214
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:40,371
And that's Hazel.

1215
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,240
Mr. Van Houten, thank you so
much for writing back to us.

1216
01:07:47,264 --> 01:07:48,644
Clearly an error in judgment.

1217
01:07:48,840 --> 01:07:51,286
Yours are the first missives
to which I've replied,

1218
01:07:51,360 --> 01:07:52,566
and look where it got me.

1219
01:07:52,720 --> 01:07:53,881
Scotch?

1220
01:07:54,040 --> 01:07:55,041
Uh...

1221
01:07:55,560 --> 01:07:56,641
No, thank you.

1222
01:07:57,840 --> 01:07:59,330
Just me, then, Lidewij.

1223
01:07:59,480 --> 01:08:01,448
Another scotch and soda, please.

1224
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:06,448
Perhaps some
breakfast first, Peter?

1225
01:08:06,640 --> 01:08:08,210
She thinks I have
a drinking problem.

1226
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,048
I also think the Earth is round.

1227
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:21,085
So, you like my book.

1228
01:08:21,320 --> 01:08:22,321
We love your book.
Yeah.

1229
01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:23,891
We love it.

1230
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:25,361
Augustus...

1231
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:28,490
He made his wish meeting
you so that we could talk.

1232
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:30,688
- No pressure.
- Yeah.

1233
01:08:31,120 --> 01:08:34,044
Did you dress
like her on purpose?

1234
01:08:35,760 --> 01:08:36,841
Kind of.

1235
01:08:37,480 --> 01:08:40,290
And, incidentally, sir,
we both really

1236
01:08:40,360 --> 01:08:42,124
wanted to thank you
for dinner last night.

1237
01:08:42,280 --> 01:08:43,850
And for the champagne.

1238
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:45,001
It was amazing.

1239
01:08:45,280 --> 01:08:46,611
It was magical.

1240
01:08:46,760 --> 01:08:48,569
We bought them
dinner last night?

1241
01:08:49,160 --> 01:08:50,889
It was our pleasure.

1242
01:08:55,200 --> 01:08:56,560
You've come a long way.

1243
01:08:58,360 --> 01:09:00,203
What can I do for you?

1244
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:02,369
We have some questions...

1245
01:09:02,520 --> 01:09:05,410
obviously, about what happens
at the end of your book.

1246
01:09:05,800 --> 01:09:08,201
Uh, specifically to those
who Anna leaves behind.

1247
01:09:08,360 --> 01:09:10,442
Like her mom,
the Dutch Tulip Man...

1248
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:13,080
How familiar are you
with Swedish hip-hop?

1249
01:09:14,680 --> 01:09:16,364
I would say, limited.

1250
01:09:16,480 --> 01:09:21,008
Uh, Lidewij, play
Bomfalleralla immediately.

1251
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:24,325
Okay-

1252
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:19,640
We don't speak Swedish, sir.

1253
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:21,086
Who the hell speaks Swedish?

1254
01:10:21,240 --> 01:10:24,528
The important thing is not what
nonsense the voices are saying...

1255
01:10:24,680 --> 01:10:26,842
but what the voices are feeling.

1256
01:10:39,400 --> 01:10:40,890
Are you messing with us?

1257
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:43,486
Like, is this some
sort of performance?

1258
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:45,526
Gus, sit down.

1259
01:10:54,840 --> 01:10:56,680
All right, so at the end
of the book, Anna's...

1260
01:10:56,704 --> 01:10:59,310
Let's imagine
you're racing a tortoise.

1261
01:10:59,640 --> 01:11:02,564
The tortoise has
a ten-yard head start.

1262
01:11:02,720 --> 01:11:04,529
In the time it takes you
to run ten yards...

1263
01:11:04,680 --> 01:11:07,968
the tortoise has moved maybe
one yard, and so on, forever.

1264
01:11:08,120 --> 01:11:09,400
You're faster than the tortoise,

1265
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:11,647
but you can never
catch him, you see?

1266
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:14,280
You can only decrease his lead.

1267
01:11:14,440 --> 01:11:16,920
Now, certainly, you can
run past the tortoise...

1268
01:11:17,120 --> 01:11:20,283
as long as you don't contemplate
the mechanics involved.

1269
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:23,087
But the question
of "how?"

1270
01:11:23,160 --> 01:11:24,924
turns out to be
so complicated...

1271
01:11:25,120 --> 01:11:27,009
that no one really solved it...

1272
01:11:27,160 --> 01:11:30,642
until Cantor's proof
that some infinities

1273
01:11:30,720 --> 01:11:32,245
are bigger than
other infinities.

1274
01:11:35,560 --> 01:11:38,769
I assume that answers
your question.

1275
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:43,607
Hazel, I'm sorry. I have
no idea what's going on.

1276
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:47,003
Yet you seemed so intelligent
in print, Mr. Waters.

1277
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:49,728
Has the cancer found its
way into your brain?

1278
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:52,601
Peter.

1279
01:11:55,280 --> 01:11:57,248
Can we, for one second,
just focus on Anna?

1280
01:11:57,400 --> 01:11:58,606
Please?

1281
01:11:59,040 --> 01:12:00,644
I understand that the story ends

1282
01:12:00,720 --> 01:12:01,920
in the middle of a sentence...

1283
01:12:01,960 --> 01:12:05,521
because she dies, or that she
becomes too sick to continue...

1284
01:12:05,680 --> 01:12:07,520
I am not interested
in talking about that book.

1285
01:12:07,590 --> 01:12:10,630
But that doesn't mean that her family
and friends don't have a future, right?

1286
01:12:10,654 --> 01:12:11,654
Right?

1287
01:12:12,520 --> 01:12:13,806
I said I'm not interested.

1288
01:12:13,960 --> 01:12:15,200
But you promised!

1289
01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:17,522
Nothing happens!
They're fiction!

1290
01:12:17,680 --> 01:12:19,762
They cease to exist the
moment the novel ends.

1291
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:21,524
But they can't!

1292
01:12:21,680 --> 01:12:23,560
I get it in a literary sense
or whatever, but...

1293
01:12:23,584 --> 01:12:25,024
I can't do this, Lidewij.

1294
01:12:25,120 --> 01:12:26,610
It's impossible
not to imagine what...

1295
01:12:26,680 --> 01:12:28,762
I will not indulge
your childish whims.

1296
01:12:28,920 --> 01:12:30,604
I refuse to pity
you in the manner

1297
01:12:30,680 --> 01:12:31,800
in which you are accustomed.

1298
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:33,960
I do not want your pity! VAN
Of course you do!

1299
01:12:33,984 --> 01:12:36,207
Like all sick kids, your
existence depends on it.

1300
01:12:36,360 --> 01:12:39,125
You are fated to live
out your days... Peter!

1301
01:12:39,280 --> 01:12:41,328
...as the child you
were when diagnosed.

1302
01:12:41,480 --> 01:12:45,166
A child who believes there is
a life after a novel ends.

1303
01:12:45,320 --> 01:12:46,765
And we as adults, we pity this.

1304
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:50,282
So, we pay for your treatments,
your oxygen machines.

1305
01:12:50,440 --> 01:12:51,646
Peter, that's enough.

1306
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:55,811
You are a side-effect
to an evolutionary process...

1307
01:12:55,960 --> 01:12:58,088
that cares little
for individual lives.

1308
01:12:58,240 --> 01:13:00,607
You are a failed
experiment in mutation.

1309
01:13:04,240 --> 01:13:05,526
Listen, douchepants...

1310
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:08,280
there is nothing that you're gonna
tell me about my disease...

1311
01:13:08,304 --> 01:13:09,590
that I don't already know.

1312
01:13:09,960 --> 01:13:12,361
I came here for one thing
and one thing only.

1313
01:13:12,720 --> 01:13:14,802
That is for you
to tell me what happens

1314
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:16,928
at the end of this goddamn book!

1315
01:13:17,240 --> 01:13:18,287
I can't tell you.

1316
01:13:18,440 --> 01:13:19,487
Bullshit!
I can't.

1317
01:13:19,640 --> 01:13:21,200
Then make something up!

1318
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:24,729
I want you to leave.

1319
01:13:42,120 --> 01:13:43,680
Have you ever stopped
to ask yourself...

1320
01:13:43,704 --> 01:13:46,275
why you care so much
about your silly questions?

1321
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:48,244
Oh, go fuck yourself.

1322
01:14:01,880 --> 01:14:04,042
Hey, it's okay.

1323
01:14:04,200 --> 01:14:05,361
It's okay.

1324
01:14:06,080 --> 01:14:07,491
I'll write you a sequel.

1325
01:14:08,520 --> 01:14:09,885
All right?
I'll write you a sequel.

1326
01:14:10,040 --> 01:14:12,805
It'll be better than any piece of
shit that drunk guy could write.

1327
01:14:13,480 --> 01:14:16,529
It'll have blood, and
guts, and sacrifice.

1328
01:14:16,720 --> 01:14:17,846
You'll love it.

1329
01:14:20,240 --> 01:14:22,288
So sorry that I spent your
wish on that asshole.

1330
01:14:22,440 --> 01:14:25,046
No, you did not spend it on him.
You spent it on us.

1331
01:14:30,120 --> 01:14:32,168
Hazel and Augustus!

1332
01:14:33,560 --> 01:14:34,686
I'm very sorry.

1333
01:14:36,080 --> 01:14:39,289
Circumstance has made him cruel.

1334
01:14:39,360 --> 01:14:41,124
I thought meeting you
would help him...

1335
01:14:41,400 --> 01:14:44,404
that he could see that his
work has shaped real lives.

1336
01:14:44,560 --> 01:14:48,690
But... I'm very sorry.

1337
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:51,404
Perhaps we can do
some sightseeing?

1338
01:14:51,480 --> 01:14:52,970
Have you been to
the Anne Frank house?

1339
01:14:53,120 --> 01:14:54,610
I'm not going anywhere
with that man.

1340
01:14:54,800 --> 01:14:55,926
No.

1341
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:57,729
He is not invited.

1342
01:15:08,160 --> 01:15:10,401
I'm afraid there's no elevator.

1343
01:15:11,040 --> 01:15:13,202
Oh. That's all right.

1344
01:15:13,320 --> 01:15:14,651
There are many stairs.

1345
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:15,801
Steep stairs.
I can do it.

1346
01:15:15,960 --> 01:15:18,770
Hazel, we don't have to...
I can do it.

1347
01:15:18,920 --> 01:15:20,046
Let's go.

1348
01:15:24,080 --> 01:15:28,449
<i>Frank's family
came from Frankfurt, in Germany.</i>

1349
01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:31,524
<i>Anne Frank's diary would
become world famous.</i>

1350
01:15:32,440 --> 01:15:35,205
<i>It's difficult
in times like these.</i>

1351
01:15:35,800 --> 01:15:39,441
<i>It's a wonder I haven't
abandoned all my ideals.</i>

1352
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:42,444
<i>They seem so absurd
and impractical...</i>

1353
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:45,964
<i>yet I cling to them
because I still believe...</i>

1354
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:51,203
<i>in spite of everything, that
people are truly good at heart.</i>

1355
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:54,929
<i>It's utterly impossible
for me to build my life...</i>

1356
01:16:00,320 --> 01:16:01,446
Shall we?

1357
01:16:01,960 --> 01:16:03,803
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1358
01:16:07,760 --> 01:16:09,040
Hazel, I'll carry it
if you want.

1359
01:16:09,160 --> 01:16:10,924
I got it.

1360
01:16:27,320 --> 01:16:29,129
Wow.

1361
01:16:29,280 --> 01:16:32,682
So this is the actual bookcase
that hid the Frank family.

1362
01:16:34,480 --> 01:16:35,481
Whoa.

1363
01:16:54,960 --> 01:16:55,961
I got it.

1364
01:16:56,040 --> 01:16:57,804
Thank you.

1365
01:17:00,880 --> 01:17:03,884
<i>We're much too young
to deal with these problems...</i>

1366
01:17:04,040 --> 01:17:06,646
<i>but they keep thrusting
themselves on</i> us...

1367
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:10,725
<i>until, finally, we're forced
to think up a solution.</i>

1368
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:11,961
You okay, Hazel?

1369
01:17:12,120 --> 01:17:13,485
Yeah.

1370
01:17:13,720 --> 01:17:15,006
Don't worry, take your time.

1371
01:17:15,160 --> 01:17:16,889
Sorry.

1372
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:18,041
Yeah?

1373
01:17:18,120 --> 01:17:19,201
Yeah.

1374
01:17:28,240 --> 01:17:31,562
<i>And yet,
when I look up at the sky...</i>

1375
01:17:31,720 --> 01:17:35,361
<i>I somehow feel that everything
will change for the better.</i>

1376
01:17:35,560 --> 01:17:38,404
<i>That this cruelty,
too, will end.</i>

1377
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:39,561
You Okay?

1378
01:17:39,640 --> 01:17:41,847
Yeah.

1379
01:17:59,880 --> 01:18:01,689
Hazel, I think that's enough.

1380
01:18:01,840 --> 01:18:03,080
You don't need...
You know?

1381
01:18:03,160 --> 01:18:04,446
Uh-huh.

1382
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:06,608
I got this.

1383
01:18:14,600 --> 01:18:17,444
<i>All is as it should be.</i>

1384
01:18:22,680 --> 01:18:25,809
<i>God wishes to see people happy.</i>

1385
01:18:27,360 --> 01:18:29,442
<i>Where there is hope...
Hazel.</i>

1386
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:33,925
<i>...there is life.</i>

1387
01:18:48,960 --> 01:18:50,962
Well done.
Yeah.

1388
01:18:51,160 --> 01:18:52,207
You Okay?

1389
01:18:52,280 --> 01:18:53,327
Yeah.

1390
01:18:54,080 --> 01:18:56,481
This is it, look.

1391
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:01,925
All right?

1392
01:19:02,080 --> 01:19:04,651
Oh, yeah.
Oh, my God.

1393
01:19:06,160 --> 01:19:07,321
Thanks.

1394
01:19:18,320 --> 01:19:21,085
The only member of the
Frank family to survive was Otto.

1395
01:19:23,160 --> 01:19:25,128
Anne's father.

1396
01:19:26,840 --> 01:19:28,365
<i>At</i> such moments...

1397
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:31,921
<i>...I can't think about
the misery...</i>

1398
01:19:32,520 --> 01:19:34,648
<i>but about the beauty
that still remains.</i>

1399
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:40,967
<i>Try to recapture the
happiness within yourself.</i>

1400
01:19:41,680 --> 01:19:45,002
<i>Think of all the beauty
in everything around you...</i>

1401
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:49,202
<i>and be happy.</i>

1402
01:20:32,240 --> 01:20:33,685
Bravo.

1403
01:20:47,440 --> 01:20:50,284
<i>I fell in love with
him the way you fall asleep.</i>

1404
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:55,720
<i>Slowly, and then all at once.</i>

1405
01:21:18,120 --> 01:21:22,284
It just sort of ends right above
where the knee would be...

1406
01:21:23,040 --> 01:21:24,041
and tapers off.

1407
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:26,041
What?

1408
01:21:26,240 --> 01:21:27,969
My leg.

1409
01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:30,767
You know, just so
you're prepared.

1410
01:21:31,240 --> 01:21:32,287
Gus...

1411
01:21:33,280 --> 01:21:35,442
get over yourself.

1412
01:21:51,680 --> 01:21:52,727
Wait.

1413
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:55,485
I can't, it's stuck.

1414
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:07,644
I love you so
much, Augustus Waters.

1415
01:22:07,840 --> 01:22:10,366
I love you too, Hazel Grace.

1416
01:22:10,840 --> 01:22:12,922
So, so much.

1417
01:22:21,600 --> 01:22:23,648
Augustus, I can't breathe.

1418
01:22:24,840 --> 01:22:26,444
It's okay.

1419
01:22:35,880 --> 01:22:37,325
Hazel.

1420
01:22:42,840 --> 01:22:44,285
You're so beautiful.

1421
01:22:44,480 --> 01:22:45,527
Stop.

1422
01:22:45,680 --> 01:22:47,569
No, you're so beautiful.

1423
01:22:48,720 --> 01:22:50,848
I'm so lucky.

1424
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:52,889
I'm so lucky.

1425
01:24:08,040 --> 01:24:09,041
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

1426
01:24:11,960 --> 01:24:13,720
I can't believe you
called him "douchepants."

1427
01:24:13,800 --> 01:24:15,040
- I know!
- You did?

1428
01:24:15,480 --> 01:24:16,680
How did you come up with that?

1429
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:18,564
I don't know, it just came out.

1430
01:24:18,720 --> 01:24:20,051
I was so angry.

1431
01:24:20,240 --> 01:24:21,241
What a monster.

1432
01:24:21,320 --> 01:24:22,446
Mom, it was awful.

1433
01:24:22,600 --> 01:24:23,931
Then what happened?

1434
01:24:24,120 --> 01:24:25,963
We went to Anne Frank House.

1435
01:24:26,080 --> 01:24:27,081
Oh, you did?

1436
01:24:27,160 --> 01:24:28,241
It was really awesome.
Was that incredible?

1437
01:24:28,320 --> 01:24:29,321
It was so awesome.

1438
01:24:29,480 --> 01:24:30,481
And after that?

1439
01:24:31,560 --> 01:24:32,641
We just walked around.

1440
01:24:37,080 --> 01:24:38,570
That sounds lovely.

1441
01:24:38,840 --> 01:24:40,330
Oh, my gosh,

1442
01:24:40,400 --> 01:24:41,561
we probably still have
a few hours, right?

1443
01:24:41,920 --> 01:24:43,320
Should we go to
the Van Gogh Museum?

1444
01:24:43,400 --> 01:24:44,811
Whatever you want.

1445
01:24:44,920 --> 01:24:47,161
Probably don't have time
to do everything, but...

1446
01:24:47,320 --> 01:24:50,529
You're just gonna have
to come back, is all.

1447
01:24:52,680 --> 01:24:54,967
Could you just not be
ridiculous right now, please?

1448
01:24:55,960 --> 01:24:59,009
Hazel, I'm not being ridiculous.

1449
01:24:59,160 --> 01:25:01,162
I'm being positive.

1450
01:25:04,920 --> 01:25:06,126
Mrs. Lancaster?

1451
01:25:06,200 --> 01:25:07,201
Yeah?

1452
01:25:07,520 --> 01:25:10,364
Do you think Hazel and I can
just have a little time alone?

1453
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:15,170
Sure, Gus.

1454
01:25:15,240 --> 01:25:17,368
Um, lam gonna run to the room...

1455
01:25:17,520 --> 01:25:21,844
and be ready whenever you
guys want to do something.

1456
01:25:28,040 --> 01:25:30,042
Want to go for a walk?

1457
01:26:15,760 --> 01:26:17,569
What is it?

1458
01:26:19,880 --> 01:26:24,408
Just before you went into the
hospital, there was this...

1459
01:26:29,280 --> 01:26:31,089
I felt an ache in my hip.

1460
01:26:34,600 --> 01:26:36,762
So, I had a PET scan...

1461
01:26:39,880 --> 01:26:42,531
and it lit up like
a Christmas tree.

1462
01:26:48,440 --> 01:26:51,569
The lining of my chest
and my liver...

1463
01:26:53,600 --> 01:26:55,602
Everywhere.

1464
01:27:03,560 --> 01:27:05,608
I'm sorry.

1465
01:27:08,880 --> 01:27:11,247
I should've told you.

1466
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:29,684
It's so unfair.

1467
01:27:36,760 --> 01:27:40,162
Apparently, the world is not
a wish-granting factory.

1468
01:27:54,800 --> 01:27:56,689
Hey, listen.

1469
01:27:57,600 --> 01:27:59,320
Don't you worry about me,
Hazel Grace, okay?

1470
01:27:59,440 --> 01:28:01,204
I'm gonna find a way
to hang around here

1471
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:02,480
and annoy you for a long time.

1472
01:28:12,320 --> 01:28:13,890
Are you in pain?

1473
01:28:14,040 --> 01:28:15,041
No.

1474
01:28:17,040 --> 01:28:18,724
I'm okay.

1475
01:28:20,360 --> 01:28:21,725
You're okay?

1476
01:28:24,480 --> 01:28:26,209
Okay-

1477
01:28:33,320 --> 01:28:35,891
I don't suppose you can
just forget about this?

1478
01:28:37,320 --> 01:28:40,085
You know, just treat
me like I'm not dying.

1479
01:28:41,840 --> 01:28:44,161
I don't think you're
dying, Augustus.

1480
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:47,651
You've just got
a touch of cancer.

1481
01:28:54,240 --> 01:28:57,084
Would it be
absolutely ludicrous...

1482
01:28:58,400 --> 01:29:00,084
if we just made out?

1483
01:29:00,360 --> 01:29:01,930
Right now?

1484
01:29:03,080 --> 01:29:04,923
Probably.

1485
01:29:41,080 --> 01:29:42,809
On...

1486
01:30:13,640 --> 01:30:15,005
So how are your eyes, Isaac?

1487
01:30:15,160 --> 01:30:16,161
They're good.

1488
01:30:16,560 --> 01:30:18,449
They're not in my head,
is the only problem.

1489
01:30:18,640 --> 01:30:19,846
Besides that...

1490
01:30:20,440 --> 01:30:23,808
Well, um, it appears my entire
body's made out of cancer now.

1491
01:30:23,960 --> 01:30:25,689
So, sorry to
one-up you, dude.

1492
01:30:26,840 --> 01:30:29,081
Did you, uh...
write his eulogy yet?

1493
01:30:29,160 --> 01:30:30,161
Dude.
What?

1494
01:30:30,320 --> 01:30:33,290
What? I haven't told
her yet, Isaac.

1495
01:30:33,440 --> 01:30:34,520
What are you talking about?

1496
01:30:34,840 --> 01:30:35,887
Oh.

1497
01:30:35,960 --> 01:30:37,007
Sorry.

1498
01:30:37,200 --> 01:30:38,531
Augustus?

1499
01:30:39,680 --> 01:30:41,682
I need speakers at my funeral.

1500
01:30:42,040 --> 01:30:44,247
So, I was hoping
that you and Isaac,

1501
01:30:44,320 --> 01:30:46,288
but mostly you...

1502
01:30:47,360 --> 01:30:50,250
would be, um,

1503
01:30:50,320 --> 01:30:52,129
kind enough
to whip something up.

1504
01:30:52,320 --> 01:30:54,448
I would love to do that.

1505
01:30:57,480 --> 01:30:59,050
Thank you.

1506
01:31:05,360 --> 01:31:07,044
You guys are cute.

1507
01:31:07,200 --> 01:31:08,531
Makes me sick.

1508
01:31:10,400 --> 01:31:11,640
You guys are gross.

1509
01:31:11,800 --> 01:31:13,484
Have you heard from Monica?

1510
01:31:13,640 --> 01:31:15,051
Nope, not a thing.

1511
01:31:15,240 --> 01:31:17,280
She hasn't even texted you
to make sure you're okay?

1512
01:31:17,400 --> 01:31:19,050
Not once.
I hate that girl.

1513
01:31:19,240 --> 01:31:20,560
But there are tons
of other girls.

1514
01:31:20,639 --> 01:31:22,119
You guys don't have
to worry about me.

1515
01:31:22,143 --> 01:31:24,486
In support group,
there's this new girl...

1516
01:31:24,640 --> 01:31:25,840
and she has these humongous...

1517
01:31:27,400 --> 01:31:29,323
How do you even know that?

1518
01:31:30,080 --> 01:31:31,844
I'm blind, but
I'm not that blind.

1519
01:31:32,240 --> 01:31:33,924
Hazel Grace?
Hmm.

1520
01:31:35,040 --> 01:31:37,247
Do you happen to
have five dollars?

1521
01:31:48,920 --> 01:31:50,570
Okay, so, now what?

1522
01:31:50,720 --> 01:31:51,926
Hey, guys?

1523
01:31:52,080 --> 01:31:54,447
I smell eggs. That eggs?

1524
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:03,206
Is it there?

1525
01:32:03,680 --> 01:32:04,920
It's there.
Mmm-hmm.

1526
01:32:06,280 --> 01:32:07,725
I'm nervous.

1527
01:32:07,880 --> 01:32:08,881
Nervous?

1528
01:32:09,120 --> 01:32:10,281
Is Monica in there?

1529
01:32:10,440 --> 01:32:11,965
It doesn't matter
where Monica is.

1530
01:32:12,120 --> 01:32:14,122
This is not about Monica.
This is about you.

1531
01:32:14,280 --> 01:32:16,601
Okay. Can I have an egg?
Hazel Grace...

1532
01:32:16,800 --> 01:32:17,847
egg me.

1533
01:32:17,960 --> 01:32:18,961
Egged.

1534
01:32:19,080 --> 01:32:20,206
Isaac.

1535
01:32:25,120 --> 01:32:26,246
All right, here we go.

1536
01:32:26,400 --> 01:32:27,880
- You got this.
- All right. Come on.

1537
01:32:31,960 --> 01:32:33,291
I didn't hear anything.

1538
01:32:33,480 --> 01:32:35,209
It's all right. A little
more to your left.

1539
01:32:36,120 --> 01:32:38,240
Wait, throw to my left, or
should I aim a little left?

1540
01:32:38,264 --> 01:32:39,264
Aim left.

1541
01:32:39,440 --> 01:32:40,771
Okay.
Left-er.

1542
01:32:41,280 --> 01:32:42,800
Gus, I think we should
wait until dark.

1543
01:32:42,824 --> 01:32:44,349
It's all dark to Isaac.

1544
01:32:44,920 --> 01:32:47,241
Dude, I'm not deaf.
I'm just blind.

1545
01:32:47,400 --> 01:32:48,925
So I can hear when you
make fun of my disability.

1546
01:32:49,120 --> 01:32:50,406
I'm sorry.
And I don't love it.

1547
01:32:50,800 --> 01:32:52,484
Where do I throw?
Just throw hard.

1548
01:32:52,640 --> 01:32:53,641
Yes.

1549
01:32:54,080 --> 01:32:55,445
Yes!
Yeah!

1550
01:32:55,600 --> 01:32:56,647
What? What?

1551
01:32:56,840 --> 01:32:58,330
I hit it! I hit it!

1552
01:32:59,600 --> 01:33:01,120
Now I know exactly
where to line it up.

1553
01:33:01,144 --> 01:33:02,904
That was so exhilarating!

1554
01:33:03,960 --> 01:33:05,610
Keep it going-
Keep going-

1555
01:33:07,600 --> 01:33:08,920
Keep throwing, keep throwing.

1556
01:33:08,944 --> 01:33:10,544
Give me more, give me
more, give me more!

1557
01:33:12,080 --> 01:33:13,081
Oh!

1558
01:33:13,440 --> 01:33:14,521
Oh, Stop, stop, stop!

1559
01:33:14,760 --> 01:33:16,000
Isaac.
Oh.

1560
01:33:17,680 --> 01:33:20,650
Hello. Are you
Monica's mother?

1561
01:33:20,840 --> 01:33:22,842
I am.
Hello, ma'am.

1562
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:24,720
Your daughter, she's done
a great injustice.

1563
01:33:24,920 --> 01:33:26,490
So we've come here
seeking revenge.

1564
01:33:27,160 --> 01:33:28,600
You see, we may not
look like much...

1565
01:33:28,760 --> 01:33:31,366
but between the three of us, we
have five legs, four eyes...

1566
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:33,284
and two-and-a-half
working pairs of lungs.

1567
01:33:33,440 --> 01:33:35,602
But we also have
two dozen eggs...

1568
01:33:35,760 --> 01:33:39,287
so if I were you,
I would go back inside.

1569
01:33:44,600 --> 01:33:46,204
Dude, it actually worked?
Yep.

1570
01:33:46,360 --> 01:33:49,160
That was the stupidest speech
I've ever... That actually worked?

1571
01:33:49,184 --> 01:33:51,505
There you go.
Hold on.

1572
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,367
This feels so good!

1573
01:34:32,400 --> 01:34:33,606
Augustus?

1574
01:34:33,760 --> 01:34:35,603
Hazel Grace.

1575
01:34:35,760 --> 01:34:37,683
Hi.

1576
01:34:37,840 --> 01:34:41,162
Oh, my God.
Hi, hi. I love you.

1577
01:34:41,360 --> 01:34:43,442
<i>I'm at the gas station.</i>

1578
01:34:43,560 --> 01:34:44,560
You're what?

1579
01:34:44,600 --> 01:34:45,840
<i>Something is wrong.</i>

1580
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:47,570
<i>You gotta...</i>

1581
01:34:48,080 --> 01:34:50,242
<i>Can you come?
Can you come and help me?</i>

1582
01:35:02,960 --> 01:35:04,564
Gus!

1583
01:35:06,440 --> 01:35:07,441
Gus.

1584
01:35:09,080 --> 01:35:10,809
Babe, what's going on?

1585
01:35:12,640 --> 01:35:13,641
Look.

1586
01:35:13,720 --> 01:35:14,801
Gus, it's infected.

1587
01:35:18,240 --> 01:35:20,288
Take a deep breath.

1588
01:35:22,720 --> 01:35:24,131
Gus, I have to call somebody.

1589
01:35:24,400 --> 01:35:26,607
No, no. Please don't call
9-1-1. Please.

1590
01:35:26,760 --> 01:35:28,091
Don't call my parents or 9...

1591
01:35:28,280 --> 01:35:29,920
I will never forgive you
if you call them.

1592
01:35:29,960 --> 01:35:31,120
Gus, what are you doing here?

1593
01:35:31,280 --> 01:35:32,645
What are you doing here?

1594
01:35:33,400 --> 01:35:35,323
I wanted to buy cigarettes.

1595
01:35:36,120 --> 01:35:37,600
I don't know what
happened to my pack.

1596
01:35:37,624 --> 01:35:39,403
I might have lost
it or something,

1597
01:35:39,480 --> 01:35:40,811
or they took it, but I just...

1598
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:45,163
I wanted to do something
for myself, you know?

1599
01:35:45,320 --> 01:35:46,526
I wanted to do it myself.

1600
01:35:47,040 --> 01:35:48,201
I have to call 9-1-1.
No!

1601
01:35:48,280 --> 01:35:49,441
I have to.

1602
01:35:49,520 --> 01:35:50,806
No!

1603
01:35:52,480 --> 01:35:55,689
Hi, 9-1-1?
Um, we need an ambulance.

1604
01:35:55,840 --> 01:35:58,525
I hate myself!

1605
01:35:58,840 --> 01:36:00,683
My name is
Hazel Grace Lancaster.

1606
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:02,001
Please hurry.

1607
01:36:02,160 --> 01:36:04,527
We're in a silver Jeep at
the gas station.

1608
01:36:04,680 --> 01:36:06,808
<i>I wish I could say
that Augustus Waters</i>

1609
01:36:06,880 --> 01:36:08,962
<i>kept his sense of
humor until the end.</i>

1610
01:36:09,400 --> 01:36:13,371
<i>That not for a single moment
did his courage waver.</i>

1611
01:36:14,400 --> 01:36:15,845
<i>But that is not what happened.</i>

1612
01:36:25,840 --> 01:36:27,604
It hurts so much.

1613
01:36:27,760 --> 01:36:29,888
I'm so stupid.

1614
01:36:40,560 --> 01:36:43,404
Baby, it's okay. It's okay.

1615
01:36:48,680 --> 01:36:50,125
Hazel?

1616
01:36:51,920 --> 01:36:53,490
Will you tell me a story?

1617
01:36:53,680 --> 01:36:55,045
A story?

1618
01:36:56,560 --> 01:36:58,722
Or, like, a poem?

1619
01:36:59,160 --> 01:37:02,642
I do know...
I... I know a poem.

1620
01:37:04,640 --> 01:37:06,404
Will you tell me it?

1621
01:37:08,080 --> 01:37:12,608
The Red Wheelbarrow
by William Carlos Williams.

1622
01:37:14,920 --> 01:37:17,924
"So much depends upon
a red wheelbarrow

1623
01:37:18,920 --> 01:37:22,163
"Glazed with rain water

1624
01:37:24,640 --> 01:37:27,325
"beside the white chickens."

1625
01:37:32,800 --> 01:37:35,690
That's it? Is that all?

1626
01:37:37,520 --> 01:37:40,126
No, no, no, of course not.
Of course not.

1627
01:37:41,640 --> 01:37:46,089
"So much depends upon...
A blue sky

1628
01:37:47,480 --> 01:37:49,801
"Cut open by
the branches of trees

1629
01:37:53,600 --> 01:37:58,925
"And so much depends upon the...
The transparent G-tube

1630
01:38:00,800 --> 01:38:04,521
"erupting from the belly of
the blue-lipped boy

1631
01:38:05,880 --> 01:38:08,281
"So much depends

1632
01:38:10,160 --> 01:38:13,004
"on this observer
of the universe"

1633
01:38:55,320 --> 01:38:56,845
How's he doing?

1634
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:58,843
He's had a tough night, Hazel.

1635
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:01,651
His blood pressure's low.

1636
01:39:02,360 --> 01:39:04,124
His heart...

1637
01:39:05,360 --> 01:39:06,725
What about the chemo?

1638
01:39:07,520 --> 01:39:09,921
They are gonna stop the chemo.

1639
01:39:16,080 --> 01:39:17,411
Can I see him?

1640
01:39:20,600 --> 01:39:22,489
We'll tell him you were here.

1641
01:39:22,760 --> 01:39:24,205
Yeah.
Okay.

1642
01:39:24,360 --> 01:39:25,850
Yeah.

1643
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:29,447
I'm just gonna hang out for
a while, if you don't mind.

1644
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:31,445
Yeah, of course.

1645
01:39:51,960 --> 01:39:53,200
Take your time.

1646
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:04,411
Here we go, bud.

1647
01:40:08,800 --> 01:40:10,131
Good?
All right, sweetie.

1648
01:40:10,280 --> 01:40:11,611
Okay-

1649
01:40:19,640 --> 01:40:20,641
Hi.

1650
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:00,843
What are you thinking about?

1651
01:41:02,400 --> 01:41:03,401
Oblivion.

1652
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:07,685
I know it's kid's stuff
or whatever, but...

1653
01:41:11,120 --> 01:41:13,248
I always thought
I would be a hero.

1654
01:41:13,800 --> 01:41:15,680
I always thought I'd have
a grand story to tell.

1655
01:41:15,760 --> 01:41:18,331
You know, something they would
publish in all the papers, and...

1656
01:41:19,960 --> 01:41:22,691
I mean, I was supposed
to be special.

1657
01:41:23,960 --> 01:41:25,769
You are special, Augustus.

1658
01:41:25,920 --> 01:41:26,921
Yeah, I know. But...

1659
01:41:27,640 --> 01:41:29,051
you know what I mean.

1660
01:41:29,400 --> 01:41:32,085
I do know what you mean,
I just don't agree with you.

1661
01:41:37,640 --> 01:41:40,041
You know this obsession you
have with being remembered?

1662
01:41:40,680 --> 01:41:43,001
Don't get mad.
I am mad.

1663
01:41:44,240 --> 01:41:46,846
I'm mad because I think you're special.
And is that not enough?

1664
01:41:49,360 --> 01:41:51,560
You think that the only way
to lead a meaningful life...

1665
01:41:51,600 --> 01:41:55,571
is for everyone to remember
you, for everyone to love you.

1666
01:41:56,040 --> 01:41:59,089
Guess what, Gus.
This is your life, okay?

1667
01:41:59,240 --> 01:42:00,924
This is all you get.

1668
01:42:01,360 --> 01:42:03,408
You get me,
and you get your family,

1669
01:42:03,480 --> 01:42:05,528
and you get this world,
and that's it.

1670
01:42:05,720 --> 01:42:08,007
And if that's not
enough for you,

1671
01:42:08,080 --> 01:42:10,321
then I'm sorry,
but it's not nothing.

1672
01:42:12,760 --> 01:42:14,728
Because I love you.

1673
01:42:16,520 --> 01:42:18,761
And I'm gonna remember you.

1674
01:42:22,480 --> 01:42:24,960
I'm sorry. You're right.

1675
01:42:25,440 --> 01:42:27,329
I just wish you
would be happy with that.

1676
01:42:27,720 --> 01:42:28,960
Hey-

1677
01:42:44,960 --> 01:42:47,167
It's a good life, Hazel Grace.

1678
01:42:51,600 --> 01:42:53,602
It's not over yet, you know.

1679
01:43:03,640 --> 01:43:04,687
Oh, Augustus.

1680
01:43:04,840 --> 01:43:07,923
<i>One of the less bullshitty
conventions of the cancer genre...</i>

1681
01:43:08,080 --> 01:43:11,846
<i>is the convention known as
the "Last Good Day"...</i>

1682
01:43:12,280 --> 01:43:16,046
<i>when it seems like the inexorable
decline has suddenly plateaued...</i>

1683
01:43:16,200 --> 01:43:19,602
<i>when the pain is,
just for a minute, bearable.</i>

1684
01:43:20,040 --> 01:43:22,805
<i>The problem, of course, is that
there's no way of knowing...</i>

1685
01:43:22,960 --> 01:43:24,760
<i>that your last good day
is your last good day.</i>

1686
01:43:26,400 --> 01:43:29,802
<i>At the time, it's just
another decent day.</i>

1687
01:43:36,600 --> 01:43:38,170
Hello, Augustus.

1688
01:43:38,240 --> 01:43:40,846
<i>Good evening, Hazel Grace.</i>

1689
01:43:42,120 --> 01:43:43,167
<i>A quick question for you.</i>

1690
01:43:43,360 --> 01:43:45,522
<i>Did you ever write that eulogy
I asked you to prepare?</i>

1691
01:43:46,720 --> 01:43:47,926
I may have.

1692
01:43:48,080 --> 01:43:49,800
<i>Do you think you could
find your way down...</i>

1693
01:43:49,954 --> 01:43:52,116
<i>to the literal Heart of Jesus
in the next few minutes?</i>

1694
01:43:52,274 --> 01:43:54,047
Maybe. ls everything okay?

1695
01:43:54,200 --> 01:43:56,009
<i>I love you, Hazel Grace.</i>

1696
01:43:59,160 --> 01:44:00,969
Can I have the keys? Oh.

1697
01:44:01,480 --> 01:44:03,847
Where you going? We're gonna eat something.
I have to go.

1698
01:44:03,920 --> 01:44:06,120
Hazel, you have to be hungry.
You didn't even eat lunch.

1699
01:44:06,160 --> 01:44:07,161
I'm just not hungry.

1700
01:44:07,320 --> 01:44:09,049
Hazel, you cannot not eat.

1701
01:44:09,200 --> 01:44:10,240
I'm aggressively
un-hungry.

1702
01:44:10,360 --> 01:44:13,011
Hazel, I know Gus is sick, but you
got to take care of yourself.

1703
01:44:13,160 --> 01:44:14,440
This has nothing to do with Gus.

1704
01:44:14,560 --> 01:44:16,040
Well, then you've
got to stay healthy.

1705
01:44:16,064 --> 01:44:18,008
Come on, just eat
something, honey.

1706
01:44:18,160 --> 01:44:19,491
"Stay healthy"?

1707
01:44:19,880 --> 01:44:22,406
Okay, I'm not healthy,
and I'm gonna die.

1708
01:44:22,560 --> 01:44:24,449
Do you realize that? I'm dying,
and you're gonna be here...

1709
01:44:24,520 --> 01:44:27,205
and you're not gonna have anyone
to look after, or hover around...

1710
01:44:27,320 --> 01:44:28,924
and you're not gonna be a mother
anymore, and I'm sorry...

1711
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:30,560
but there's nothing
I can do about that.

1712
01:44:30,680 --> 01:44:31,761
So, can I please go?

1713
01:44:31,920 --> 01:44:33,604
Why would you say that to me?

1714
01:44:33,760 --> 01:44:35,091
Because you said that.

1715
01:44:35,240 --> 01:44:36,765
What are you talking about?

1716
01:44:36,920 --> 01:44:38,285
In the ICU.

1717
01:44:40,600 --> 01:44:41,806
Hazel...

1718
01:44:43,320 --> 01:44:45,243
That's not the truth.
I was wrong.

1719
01:44:46,600 --> 01:44:47,806
All right?

1720
01:44:48,120 --> 01:44:49,770
Even if you died...

1721
01:44:50,120 --> 01:44:51,281
"When."

1722
01:44:55,760 --> 01:44:57,569
Even when you die...

1723
01:45:00,040 --> 01:45:01,963
I'll always be your mother.

1724
01:45:04,680 --> 01:45:06,921
It's the greatest
thing I'll ever be.

1725
01:45:08,800 --> 01:45:10,370
That is my biggest fear, Mom.

1726
01:45:10,920 --> 01:45:12,251
When I am gone...

1727
01:45:12,400 --> 01:45:14,801
you're not gonna
have a life anymore.

1728
01:45:14,960 --> 01:45:17,160
You're just gonna sit and
you're gonna stare at walls...

1729
01:45:17,184 --> 01:45:18,928
or you're gonna
off yourselves or...

1730
01:45:19,120 --> 01:45:22,169
Hazel, honey,
we're not gonna do that.

1731
01:45:23,920 --> 01:45:25,445
Losing you...

1732
01:45:27,520 --> 01:45:30,444
That is gonna hurt like hell.

1733
01:45:32,200 --> 01:45:37,127
But you of all people know it's
possible to live with pain.

1734
01:45:40,240 --> 01:45:41,810
You just do it.

1735
01:45:46,240 --> 01:45:50,404
I'm taking classes
in social work.

1736
01:45:50,960 --> 01:45:52,291
Wait, you're what?

1737
01:45:52,880 --> 01:45:53,881
Yeah, um...

1738
01:45:55,960 --> 01:45:57,920
You know, if I can take
what we've been through...

1739
01:45:57,944 --> 01:46:01,426
and help other people,
maybe counsel families...

1740
01:46:02,200 --> 01:46:03,964
Mom, how could you
not tell me this?

1741
01:46:04,120 --> 01:46:06,327
We didn't want you
to feel abandoned.

1742
01:46:06,480 --> 01:46:07,970
Feel abandoned?

1743
01:46:09,840 --> 01:46:11,490
You guys, this is...

1744
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:16,889
This is the best news.

1745
01:46:17,200 --> 01:46:18,440
You go.

1746
01:46:20,200 --> 01:46:21,201
Okay?

1747
01:46:23,800 --> 01:46:24,961
Baby.

1748
01:46:26,960 --> 01:46:28,007
Straight ahead, yeah.

1749
01:46:28,160 --> 01:46:29,525
To your left, a little bit.

1750
01:46:30,760 --> 01:46:31,761
That's a step, right?

1751
01:46:31,840 --> 01:46:32,841
Yeah, put your hand out.

1752
01:46:33,280 --> 01:46:34,770
There's a podium to your right.

1753
01:46:34,920 --> 01:46:36,649
Yeah, perfect.

1754
01:46:45,520 --> 01:46:46,601
Beautiful.

1755
01:46:48,440 --> 01:46:49,646
Hi.

1756
01:46:49,920 --> 01:46:50,921
You're late.

1757
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:53,207
How you doing? You look
ravishing, Hazel Grace.

1758
01:46:53,280 --> 01:46:55,408
I know, right?

1759
01:47:00,360 --> 01:47:01,646
What's going on, guys?

1760
01:47:02,120 --> 01:47:03,281
Tell her, Gus.

1761
01:47:04,040 --> 01:47:06,168
I wanted to attend
my own funeral.

1762
01:47:07,080 --> 01:47:10,801
I mean, I'm hopeful that I'll be
able to attend as a ghost, but...

1763
01:47:12,160 --> 01:47:14,527
However, just in case
it doesn't work out...

1764
01:47:14,680 --> 01:47:17,729
I decided to plan
this pre-funeral.

1765
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:20,161
Ready?

1766
01:47:23,920 --> 01:47:26,491
Augustus Waters was a cocky son of a bitch.

1767
01:47:27,040 --> 01:47:28,565
But we forgave him.

1768
01:47:29,120 --> 01:47:31,168
Not because of his
superhuman good looks...

1769
01:47:31,240 --> 01:47:33,163
or because he only got 19 years

1770
01:47:33,240 --> 01:47:35,129
when he should've
gotten way more.

1771
01:47:35,280 --> 01:47:36,725
18 years, buddy.

1772
01:47:36,880 --> 01:47:38,291
Dude, come on. Really?

1773
01:47:38,360 --> 01:47:41,000
I'm assuming you have a little more
time, you interrupting bastard.

1774
01:47:41,024 --> 01:47:43,704
Interrupt me in the middle of my eulogy.
You're supposed to be dead.

1775
01:47:44,880 --> 01:47:48,680
But when the scientists
from the future...

1776
01:47:48,840 --> 01:47:52,003
come to my house
with robot eyes...

1777
01:47:52,160 --> 01:47:54,527
and they tell me
to try them on...

1778
01:47:57,320 --> 01:48:00,529
I'm gonna tell those scientists
to piss off, because...

1779
01:48:01,720 --> 01:48:04,803
because Gus, I don't even want
to see a world without you.

1780
01:48:06,320 --> 01:48:07,367
I don't.

1781
01:48:07,440 --> 01:48:10,284
I don't want to see a world
without Augustus Waters.

1782
01:48:13,640 --> 01:48:16,240
Then, having made my point, I'll
probably put the robot eyes on...

1783
01:48:16,264 --> 01:48:18,088
because, you know,
they're robot eyes.

1784
01:48:18,240 --> 01:48:19,685
Sounds awesome.

1785
01:48:22,320 --> 01:48:24,368
And I don't know...
Um...

1786
01:48:24,560 --> 01:48:27,040
This is just so hard.

1787
01:48:27,120 --> 01:48:28,121
Um...

1788
01:48:28,560 --> 01:48:30,324
Godspeed.

1789
01:48:31,120 --> 01:48:32,121
Yeah.

1790
01:48:32,200 --> 01:48:34,487
Hazel, can I get a hand here?

1791
01:48:43,800 --> 01:48:45,529
To the right, a little bit.

1792
01:48:48,040 --> 01:48:51,328
Yeah, and turn around.
Sit down. There you go.

1793
01:48:55,840 --> 01:48:57,922
It's down to you, Hazel Grace.

1794
01:49:23,520 --> 01:49:24,567
Hello.

1795
01:49:24,720 --> 01:49:28,406
My name is
Hazel Grace Lancaster...

1796
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:34,324
and Augustus Waters was the
star-crossed love of my life.

1797
01:49:34,480 --> 01:49:36,289
Ours was an epic love story...

1798
01:49:36,440 --> 01:49:40,206
and I probably won't be able to
get more than a sentence out...

1799
01:49:40,360 --> 01:49:43,443
without disappearing
into a puddle of tears.

1800
01:49:45,480 --> 01:49:47,289
Like all real love stories...

1801
01:49:47,440 --> 01:49:49,204
ours will die with us.

1802
01:49:49,360 --> 01:49:50,691
As it should.

1803
01:49:54,040 --> 01:49:57,647
You know, I'd kind of hoped that
he would be the one eulogizing me.

1804
01:49:58,800 --> 01:50:00,848
Because there's really
no one else...

1805
01:50:04,600 --> 01:50:06,409
Yeah, no. Um...

1806
01:50:08,600 --> 01:50:11,251
I'm not gonna talk about our
love story, because I can't.

1807
01:50:11,400 --> 01:50:15,769
So, instead,
I'm gonna talk about math.

1808
01:50:18,040 --> 01:50:22,011
I am not a mathematician,
but I do know this.

1809
01:50:22,560 --> 01:50:25,723
There are infinite numbers
between zero and one.

1810
01:50:25,880 --> 01:50:30,807
There's point-one, point-one-two,
and point-one-one-two, and...

1811
01:50:31,320 --> 01:50:33,687
and an infinite
collection of others.

1812
01:50:34,840 --> 01:50:37,161
Of course,
there is a bigger infinite

1813
01:50:37,240 --> 01:50:39,607
set of numbers
between zero and two...

1814
01:50:39,960 --> 01:50:43,851
or between zero and a million.

1815
01:50:45,280 --> 01:50:49,365
Some infinities are simply
bigger than other infinities.

1816
01:50:51,280 --> 01:50:54,045
A writer that we used
to like taught us that.

1817
01:50:55,840 --> 01:50:58,286
You know, I want more numbers...

1818
01:50:58,440 --> 01:51:00,169
than I'm likely to get.

1819
01:51:03,040 --> 01:51:04,451
And, God...

1820
01:51:06,120 --> 01:51:08,088
do I want more days
for Augustus Waters

1821
01:51:08,160 --> 01:51:09,446
than what he got.

1822
01:51:13,840 --> 01:51:15,171
But, Gus...

1823
01:51:16,720 --> 01:51:18,245
my love...

1824
01:51:19,400 --> 01:51:21,880
I cannot tell you
how thankful I am...

1825
01:51:23,360 --> 01:51:25,328
for our little infinity.

1826
01:51:36,960 --> 01:51:38,371
Hold on.

1827
01:51:46,040 --> 01:51:48,361
You gave me a forever...

1828
01:51:50,400 --> 01:51:52,880
within the numbered days.

1829
01:51:53,040 --> 01:51:54,963
And for that, lam...

1830
01:51:56,120 --> 01:51:58,248
lam eternally grateful.

1831
01:52:05,040 --> 01:52:07,327
I love you so much.

1832
01:52:09,800 --> 01:52:11,768
I love you, too.

1833
01:52:32,080 --> 01:52:35,448
<i>Augustus Waters died
eight days later in the ICU.</i>

1834
01:52:36,600 --> 01:52:39,888
<i>When the cancer,
which was made of him...</i>

1835
01:52:40,560 --> 01:52:44,929
<i>stopped his heart, which
was also made of him.</i>

1836
01:53:44,520 --> 01:53:46,409
<i>It was unbearable.</i>

1837
01:53:46,760 --> 01:53:48,364
<i>The whole thing.</i>

1838
01:53:49,480 --> 01:53:52,086
<i>Every second,
worse than the last.</i>

1839
01:53:58,120 --> 01:54:00,040
<i>One of the first things
they ask you in the</i> ER...

1840
01:54:00,080 --> 01:54:02,924
<i>is to rate your pain
on a scale from one to ten.</i>

1841
01:54:04,920 --> 01:54:06,880
<i>I've been asked this question
hundreds of times...</i>

1842
01:54:06,960 --> 01:54:09,042
<i>and I remember once...</i>

1843
01:54:09,200 --> 01:54:11,123
<i>when I couldn't catch my breath</i>

1844
01:54:11,200 --> 01:54:13,043
<i>and it felt like
my chest was on fire...</i>

1845
01:54:14,240 --> 01:54:16,163
<i>the nurse asked me
to rate the pain.</i>

1846
01:54:16,320 --> 01:54:19,290
<i>Though I couldn't speak,
I held up nine fingers.</i>

1847
01:54:20,440 --> 01:54:22,408
<i>Later, when I started
feeling better...</i>

1848
01:54:22,560 --> 01:54:25,325
<i>the nurse came in
and she called me a fighter.</i>

1849
01:54:26,280 --> 01:54:28,408
<i>"You know how I know?"
she said.</i>

1850
01:54:29,200 --> 01:54:31,362
<i>"You called a ten a nine."</i>

1851
01:54:32,480 --> 01:54:34,050
<i>But that wasn't the truth.</i>

1852
01:54:34,320 --> 01:54:37,164
<i>I didn't call it a nine
because I was brave.</i>

1853
01:54:38,720 --> 01:54:43,760
<i>The reason I called it a nine was
because I was saving my ten.</i>

1854
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:46,525
<i>And this was it.</i>

1855
01:54:49,040 --> 01:54:51,407
<i>This was the great
and terrible ten.</i>

1856
01:54:51,880 --> 01:54:54,565
<i>"I will fear no
evil, for You are with me...</i>

1857
01:54:55,280 --> 01:54:58,807
"Your rod and your staff,
they comfort me.

1858
01:54:58,960 --> 01:55:01,964
"You prepare a table before me
in the presence of my enemies.

1859
01:55:02,160 --> 01:55:06,165
"You anoint my head with oil.
My cup overflows.

1860
01:55:06,600 --> 01:55:11,049
"Surely, goodness and love will
follow me all the days of my life...

1861
01:55:11,200 --> 01:55:13,487
"and I will dwell
in the house of the Lord...

1862
01:55:13,840 --> 01:55:15,171
"forever."

1863
01:55:18,200 --> 01:55:21,488
Augustus Waters
fought hard for many years.

1864
01:55:22,880 --> 01:55:26,601
His battle was a courageous
one, and his strength...

1865
01:55:26,760 --> 01:55:28,410
What a load of shit, huh, kid?

1866
01:55:28,480 --> 01:55:30,840
...was a source of inspiration
for each and every one of us.

1867
01:55:33,360 --> 01:55:34,771
Let us pray.

1868
01:55:36,280 --> 01:55:38,601
We thank You, Lord, for the
life of Augustus Waters...

1869
01:55:38,960 --> 01:55:40,325
We need to
fake-pray now.

1870
01:55:40,480 --> 01:55:43,484
...for his
strength and his courage.

1871
01:55:43,680 --> 01:55:47,287
Lord, we ask that You be with
us today, that You be close...

1872
01:55:47,440 --> 01:55:50,011
that You comfort
his friends and family.

1873
01:55:50,160 --> 01:55:52,003
Thank You for
Your presence, Lord.

1874
01:55:52,680 --> 01:55:54,569
All this we pray in Jesus' name.

1875
01:55:55,120 --> 01:55:56,121
Amen.

1876
01:55:56,280 --> 01:55:57,486
Amen.

1877
01:55:57,880 --> 01:56:02,681
Now, we are going to hear
from Gus' special friend...

1878
01:56:02,840 --> 01:56:05,002
Hazel Lancaster.

1879
01:56:15,920 --> 01:56:19,845
Not that it really matters,
but I was his girlfriend.

1880
01:57:00,040 --> 01:57:03,761
There's a beautiful quote
in Gus' home that reads...

1881
01:57:03,920 --> 01:57:06,201
"if you want the rainbow, you
have to deal with the rain."

1882
01:57:09,640 --> 01:57:12,086
Even in his last few days...

1883
01:57:12,680 --> 01:57:13,727
Um...

1884
01:57:13,800 --> 01:57:15,006
<i>I didn't believe a word.</i>

1885
01:57:15,160 --> 01:57:17,481
He was always able
to crack a smile.

1886
01:57:18,120 --> 01:57:19,690
<i>But that's okay.</i>

1887
01:57:22,400 --> 01:57:25,290
<i>I knew this was
the right thing to do.</i>

1888
01:57:26,240 --> 01:57:30,325
<i>Funerals, I'd decided,
are not for the dead.</i>

1889
01:57:32,280 --> 01:57:33,280
<i>They're for the living.</i>

1890
01:57:33,320 --> 01:57:35,129
Hey, want some company?

1891
01:57:35,280 --> 01:57:36,281
No, I'm okay.

1892
01:57:36,480 --> 01:57:39,962
I'm just gonna drive
for a bit by myself.

1893
01:57:40,240 --> 01:57:41,321
Love you.

1894
01:57:43,240 --> 01:57:44,571
Love you.

1895
01:57:45,120 --> 01:57:46,406
You spoke beautifully.

1896
01:57:47,640 --> 01:57:49,051
I'll see you soon.
Drive safe.

1897
01:57:49,200 --> 01:57:50,281
Okay-

1898
01:58:15,120 --> 01:58:16,281
May I?

1899
01:58:18,600 --> 01:58:21,809
<i>Omnis cellula e cellula.</i>

1900
01:58:23,960 --> 01:58:27,362
Your boy Waters and I corresponded
quite a bit in his last days.

1901
01:58:27,520 --> 01:58:29,488
Oh. So, you read
your fan mail now?

1902
01:58:29,680 --> 01:58:31,569
I wouldn't exactly
call him a fan.

1903
01:58:31,720 --> 01:58:33,165
He detested me.

1904
01:58:33,680 --> 01:58:37,287
But he was quite insistent
I attend his funeral...

1905
01:58:37,440 --> 01:58:39,681
and tell you what became
of Anna and her mother...

1906
01:58:39,880 --> 01:58:41,609
so here I am.

1907
01:58:41,920 --> 01:58:44,526
And that's your answer,
"Omnis cellula e cellula."

1908
01:58:44,720 --> 01:58:45,846
"Life comes from life."

1909
01:58:47,360 --> 01:58:48,440
I'm really not in the mood.

1910
01:58:48,520 --> 01:58:49,720
You don't want an explanation?

1911
01:58:49,800 --> 01:58:51,211
No, I don't.

1912
01:58:51,360 --> 01:58:53,488
Thank you, though.
Have a great life.

1913
01:58:54,040 --> 01:58:55,644
You remind me of her.

1914
01:58:57,200 --> 01:59:00,044
I remind a lot of people
of a lot of people.

1915
01:59:01,200 --> 01:59:02,804
My daughter was eight.

1916
01:59:04,680 --> 01:59:09,447
And she suffered
beautifully for so long.

1917
01:59:11,680 --> 01:59:13,808
She had leukemia like Anna?

1918
01:59:14,840 --> 01:59:16,490
Just like Anna.

1919
01:59:20,080 --> 01:59:22,890
I'm very sorry for your loss.

1920
01:59:23,040 --> 01:59:26,249
And I'm sorry for yours. And
sorry for ruining your trip.

1921
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:28,729
You didn't ruin our trip.

1922
01:59:28,880 --> 01:59:30,405
We had an amazing trip.

1923
01:59:33,280 --> 01:59:37,080
Are you familiar
with the Trolley Problem?

1924
01:59:37,240 --> 01:59:41,040
There's a thought experiment
in the field of ethics...

1925
01:59:41,200 --> 01:59:42,964
known as the Trolley Problem.

1926
01:59:43,120 --> 01:59:45,043
Philippa Foot was
an English philosopher...

1927
01:59:45,240 --> 01:59:46,526
Oh, my God.

1928
01:59:46,880 --> 01:59:49,008
Hazel, I'm trying to
explain something to you.

1929
01:59:49,200 --> 01:59:50,720
I'm trying to give you
what you wanted.

1930
01:59:50,744 --> 01:59:51,367
No, you're not!

1931
01:59:51,520 --> 01:59:53,170
You are a drunk,
and you're a failure...

1932
01:59:53,320 --> 01:59:55,200
and I need you to get out
of my car right now...

1933
01:59:55,224 --> 01:59:58,751
so that I can go home, and
be by myself and grieve!

1934
01:59:59,760 --> 02:00:01,364
You'll want to read this.

1935
02:00:03,880 --> 02:00:05,530
I don't want to read anything.

1936
02:00:05,600 --> 02:00:07,204
Can you just get out of my car?

1937
02:00:12,120 --> 02:00:13,246
Please get out of my car!

1938
02:00:13,320 --> 02:00:14,401
Fine.

1939
02:01:21,640 --> 02:01:23,449
Can I come in?

1940
02:01:35,680 --> 02:01:37,409
I'm so, so sorry.

1941
02:01:39,760 --> 02:01:41,091
Yeah.

1942
02:01:47,440 --> 02:01:51,240
It was a privilege,
though, wasn't it?

1943
02:01:51,400 --> 02:01:52,765
To love him?

1944
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:07,890
Gives you an idea
how we feel about you.

1945
02:02:15,880 --> 02:02:17,245
Hazel?

1946
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:20,207
There's a friend
here to see you.

1947
02:02:21,640 --> 02:02:24,166
Do you know if
it hurt or whatever?

1948
02:02:25,640 --> 02:02:28,883
Apparently he was struggling
for breath for a long time...

1949
02:02:29,040 --> 02:02:31,725
and then eventually
he just went unconscious.

1950
02:02:32,960 --> 02:02:34,485
It wasn't great or anything.

1951
02:02:35,880 --> 02:02:37,370
Dying sucks.

1952
02:02:39,800 --> 02:02:41,484
Gus really loved you, you know?

1953
02:02:42,160 --> 02:02:43,400
I know.

1954
02:02:45,560 --> 02:02:47,483
He wouldn't shut up about it.

1955
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:49,047
Yeah.

1956
02:02:49,200 --> 02:02:52,090
It was annoying. He
talked about you so much.

1957
02:02:52,240 --> 02:02:53,571
I didn't find it that annoying.

1958
02:02:53,760 --> 02:02:56,081
I know.
I know you didn't.

1959
02:03:05,160 --> 02:03:07,527
Did you get that letter
from your author friend?

1960
02:03:08,040 --> 02:03:09,530
Ew. He's not my friend.

1961
02:03:10,160 --> 02:03:11,240
How do you know about that?

1962
02:03:11,360 --> 02:03:13,120
Well, I was talking
to him at the cemetery...

1963
02:03:13,144 --> 02:03:17,050
and he said he came all this way
to give that letter to you.

1964
02:03:17,280 --> 02:03:19,362
Yeah, well, I'm over it.

1965
02:03:19,520 --> 02:03:22,444
I have no interest in reading another
word of that asshole's again.

1966
02:03:22,600 --> 02:03:24,443
No, he didn't write it.
Gus wrote it.

1967
02:03:24,760 --> 02:03:26,046
What?

1968
02:03:26,200 --> 02:03:27,770
Apparently Gus wrote
something down

1969
02:03:27,840 --> 02:03:29,365
and then sent it to Van Houten.

1970
02:03:32,400 --> 02:03:33,890
Oh, my God.

1971
02:03:42,880 --> 02:03:47,204
<i>Mr. Van Houten, I'm a good
person, but a shitty writer.</i>

1972
02:03:48,200 --> 02:03:50,885
<i>You're a shitty person,
but a good writer.</i>

1973
02:03:51,040 --> 02:03:53,088
<i>I think we'd make a good team.</i>

1974
02:03:53,240 --> 02:03:54,890
<i>I don't want to ask you
for any favors...</i>

1975
02:03:55,040 --> 02:03:58,328
<i>but if you have the time, and from
what I saw, you have plenty...</i>

1976
02:03:58,480 --> 02:04:00,050
<i>please fix this for me.</i>

1977
02:04:00,240 --> 02:04:02,402
<i>It's a eulogy for Hazel.</i>

1978
02:04:06,120 --> 02:04:07,760
<i>She asked me to write one,
and I'm trying.</i>

1979
02:04:07,880 --> 02:04:11,248
<i>I just...
I could use a little flair.</i>

1980
02:04:11,760 --> 02:04:14,730
<i>See, the thing is, we all
want to be remembered.</i>

1981
02:04:17,320 --> 02:04:18,845
<i>But Hazel's different.</i>

1982
02:04:19,760 --> 02:04:21,444
<i>Hazel knows the truth.</i>

1983
02:04:21,640 --> 02:04:25,247
<i>She didn't want a million admirers.
She just wanted one.</i>

1984
02:04:25,400 --> 02:04:26,606
<i>And she got it.</i>

1985
02:04:27,240 --> 02:04:30,687
<i>Maybe she wasn't loved widely,
but she was loved deeply.</i>

1986
02:04:31,240 --> 02:04:33,481
<i>And isn't that more
than most of us get?</i>

1987
02:04:35,360 --> 02:04:38,967
<i>When Hazel was sick,
I knew I was dying...</i>

1988
02:04:39,120 --> 02:04:41,282
<i>but I didn't want to say so.</i>

1989
02:04:46,120 --> 02:04:48,487
<i>She was in the ICU, and I
snuck in for 10 minutes...</i>

1990
02:04:48,640 --> 02:04:51,450
<i>and I sat with her,
before I got caught.</i>

1991
02:04:53,040 --> 02:04:55,805
<i>Her eyes were closed.
Her skin, pale.</i>

1992
02:04:55,960 --> 02:04:58,281
<i>But her hands
were still her hands.</i>

1993
02:04:58,720 --> 02:05:02,122
<i>Still warm, and her nails were painted
this dark blue-black color...</i>

1994
02:05:02,280 --> 02:05:05,170
<i>and I just held them.</i>

1995
02:05:05,320 --> 02:05:08,130
<i>And I willed myself to imagine
a world without us...</i>

1996
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:11,321
<i>and what a worthless world
that would be.</i>

1997
02:05:14,480 --> 02:05:16,642
<i>She's so beautiful.</i>

1998
02:05:17,200 --> 02:05:18,884
<i>You don't get tired
of looking at her.</i>

1999
02:05:19,040 --> 02:05:20,760
<i>You never worry if she's
smarter than you...</i>

2000
02:05:20,784 --> 02:05:22,548
<i>because you know she is.</i>

2001
02:05:24,160 --> 02:05:26,640
<i>She's funny without
ever being mean.</i>

2002
02:05:28,640 --> 02:05:30,051
<i>I love her.</i>

2003
02:05:30,800 --> 02:05:31,801
<i>God, I love her.</i>

2004
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:34,526
<i>I'm so lucky to love her,
Van Houten.</i>

2005
02:05:42,760 --> 02:05:44,960
<i>You don't get to choose if you
get hurt in this world...</i>

2006
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:48,163
<i>but you do have a say
in who hurts you.</i>

2007
02:05:48,840 --> 02:05:50,842
<i>And I like my choices.</i>

2008
02:05:51,920 --> 02:05:54,048
<i>I hope she likes hers.</i>

2009
02:05:55,160 --> 02:05:56,924
<i>Okay, Hazel Grace?</i>

2010
02:05:59,400 --> 02:06:00,731
Okay-
