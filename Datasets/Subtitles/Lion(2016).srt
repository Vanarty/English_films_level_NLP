1
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,500
Saroo.

2
00:03:09,512 --> 00:03:11,832
Saroo!

3
00:03:22,383 --> 00:03:25,593
Come on, come on!

4
00:03:27,972 --> 00:03:29,522
Get up!

5
00:03:33,018 --> 00:03:35,688
Come on, quickly!
Hold it properly, Saroo, catch!

6
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,990
Get down!

7
00:03:48,867 --> 00:03:50,947
Guddu! The guards!

8
00:03:52,871 --> 00:03:54,711
Hey, boy, get down!

9
00:03:54,999 --> 00:03:59,499
Go! Get down, boy!

10
00:04:29,074 --> 00:04:30,874
Saroo

11
00:04:31,285 --> 00:04:32,745
I'm here!

12
00:04:32,786 --> 00:04:35,156
We will get a lot of money today

13
00:04:35,205 --> 00:04:36,995
We've got a lot of coal!

14
00:04:37,041 --> 00:04:38,751
Show me!

15
00:04:39,001 --> 00:04:40,381
Ohhh, so much!

16
00:04:41,211 --> 00:04:46,051
You kept telling me how little I am
but see how clever I am?

17
00:04:46,091 --> 00:04:48,011
That's right, you are!

18
00:04:48,844 --> 00:04:50,554
You jumped from so high!
What a leap!

19
00:04:50,596 --> 00:04:52,176
Yes, great heights!

20
00:04:59,772 --> 00:05:02,362
Give them some milk, two packets

21
00:05:09,406 --> 00:05:11,826
Guddu, I want some jalebis!

22
00:05:14,662 --> 00:05:17,082
One day I will buy you some jalebis

23
00:05:17,122 --> 00:05:19,882
We'll buy the whole shop!

24
00:05:20,292 --> 00:05:21,462
Ha, alright

25
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:31,600
- Which way should I go now?
- Left, left!

26
00:05:32,054 --> 00:05:34,854
- Which way now?
- Right, right

27
00:05:40,145 --> 00:05:42,055
Do you want to drink some milk?

28
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:51,780
I got some milk!

29
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,540
It's magic

30
00:06:07,423 --> 00:06:12,853
Tell me now
how did you get the milk?

31
00:06:15,848 --> 00:06:16,868
Be honest

32
00:06:16,869 --> 00:06:17,899
Guddu? My Saroo?

33
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,740
No

34
00:06:39,204 --> 00:06:41,374
Okay, Shekila, I have to work now

35
00:06:43,083 --> 00:06:45,503
Who's going to look after Shekila?

36
00:06:46,503 --> 00:06:48,343
My Saroo?

37
00:06:51,216 --> 00:06:53,506
Come, eat

38
00:06:53,886 --> 00:06:57,216
Sleep... sleep

39
00:07:06,565 --> 00:07:08,275
How long will you be away for?

40
00:07:08,317 --> 00:07:10,647
You did a really good job today

41
00:07:17,201 --> 00:07:18,831
I want to come too

42
00:07:20,871 --> 00:07:23,961
- How many days?
- I'm going for a week

43
00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:27,458
- Who's going to look after Shekila?
- Kallu will be here

44
00:07:27,795 --> 00:07:32,165
- You're too small to lift bales
- I can lift anything

45
00:07:37,783 --> 00:07:38,783
Guddu!

46
00:07:38,785 --> 00:07:41,135
Can I come too?

47
00:07:41,183 --> 00:07:43,393
You're too small, you can't do this

48
00:07:43,435 --> 00:07:45,765
I can lift anything

49
00:07:48,816 --> 00:07:54,316
Saroo, I've told you
it's night work, not for kids

50
00:07:54,363 --> 00:07:57,073
Go, go, you're too small

51
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,620
Saroo, leave it

52
00:08:00,452 --> 00:08:02,372
I can lift this

53
00:08:08,586 --> 00:08:10,166
Okay, fine

54
00:08:19,597 --> 00:08:21,177
Hey, Guddu!

55
00:08:21,223 --> 00:08:23,393
Hey! How are you, Shankar?

56
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:11,820
- Saroo, come on, wake up now!
- I want to sleep

57
00:09:17,863 --> 00:09:20,033
- Saroo, wake up!
- I want to sleep

58
00:09:20,074 --> 00:09:22,704
- Saroo
- I want to sleep

59
00:09:22,743 --> 00:09:26,463
- Saroo, wake up
- Don't annoy me, I am sleeping

60
00:09:26,497 --> 00:09:29,207
It's my fault, I brought you here

61
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:31,710
You're too young for the night work

62
00:09:31,752 --> 00:09:34,132
It's so late
you will never be able to work

63
00:09:40,356 --> 00:09:42,356
Saroo, Saroo...

64
00:09:42,358 --> 00:09:44,968
Saroo, I'm going
to find out about work, okay?

65
00:09:45,015 --> 00:09:47,015
And then I'll come back

66
00:09:47,059 --> 00:09:49,399
You wait here, don't go anywhere

67
00:09:51,832 --> 00:09:52,632
Guddu?

68
00:09:52,634 --> 00:09:53,634
Guddu!

69
00:09:54,567 --> 00:09:56,857
Just bring back a hundred jalebis

70
00:09:56,902 --> 00:09:58,402
You want jalebis?

71
00:09:58,445 --> 00:10:01,445
- Bring me two thousand jalebis!
- Jalebis?

72
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:03,950
Just wait there, don't go anywhere

73
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,899
Guddu?

74
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:39,900
Guddu!

75
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,900
Guddu?

76
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:29,149
Guddu?

77
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:30,200
Guddu!

78
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,900
Guddu?

79
00:12:34,602 --> 00:12:36,312
Help me!

80
00:12:40,232 --> 00:12:44,782
Guddu! Guddu!

81
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:47,280
Guddu! Guddu!

82
00:12:47,323 --> 00:12:49,163
Someone save me!

83
00:12:49,992 --> 00:12:51,832
Help me!

84
00:12:52,494 --> 00:12:54,794
Help!

85
00:12:56,498 --> 00:12:58,038
Guddu!

86
00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:42,835
Mum, I love you very much

87
00:13:43,462 --> 00:13:46,592
Guddu, I miss you very much

88
00:14:04,942 --> 00:14:09,412
The train on platform two
is a decommissioned train

89
00:14:09,446 --> 00:14:11,946
It is not taking passengers

90
00:14:11,991 --> 00:14:13,581
Save me!

91
00:14:13,617 --> 00:14:15,537
Someone help me!

92
00:14:16,203 --> 00:14:18,083
Get me out of here!

93
00:14:22,501 --> 00:14:24,421
Save me...

94
00:14:27,214 --> 00:14:30,634
Get me out of here! Save me!

95
00:14:34,471 --> 00:14:37,391
Save me! Save me!

96
00:15:56,262 --> 00:15:57,762
Open!

97
00:16:38,345 --> 00:16:40,095
Guddu!

98
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:44,940
Mum!

99
00:16:48,105 --> 00:16:49,935
Guddu!

100
00:16:52,818 --> 00:16:54,648
Mum!

101
00:17:03,787 --> 00:17:05,747
Ganestalay?

102
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:09,130
I want to go home, Ganestalay

103
00:17:13,005 --> 00:17:14,545
Ganestalay?

104
00:17:20,012 --> 00:17:23,432
Ganestalay? I want to go home

105
00:17:23,474 --> 00:17:25,894
I don't understand! Speak Bengali!
I don't understand you

106
00:17:27,269 --> 00:17:30,559
Move! What's the matter?
You don't understand Bengali?

107
00:17:30,606 --> 00:17:32,106
Ganestalay?

108
00:24:17,388 --> 00:24:22,428
Don't walk on that
you're going to fall off

109
00:24:26,897 --> 00:24:30,647
- Do you understand Hindi?
- Yes

110
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:36,780
- Where are you going?
- I have to go home, I am lost

111
00:24:37,866 --> 00:24:42,076
- Did you come from this way or that w

112
00:24:42,121 --> 00:24:44,041
Then how will you go?

00:24:55,009 --> 00:24:56,679
My name is Noor

115
00:25:00,598 --> 00:25:02,518
You're hungry?

116
00:25:07,646 --> 00:25:09,476
Come on

117
00:25:12,526 --> 00:25:14,816
Come inside, come on!

118
00:25:20,117 --> 00:25:21,737
Come on!

119
00:25:32,504 --> 00:25:35,514
I have to do all this

120
00:25:35,841 --> 00:25:39,721
make lunch boxes for all the men
you have to feed your stomach, you kno

121
00:25:42,014 --> 00:25:44,024
Everybody has to work

122
00:25:44,433 --> 00:25:51,233
I help my mum to carry rocks

123
00:25:52,524 --> 00:25:54,404
Your mum carries rocks?

124
00:26:05,329 --> 00:26:07,869
What is this?

125
00:26:09,875 --> 00:26:11,585
Just drink

126
00:26:16,215 --> 00:26:18,835
Leave some for me!

127
00:26:46,704 --> 00:26:49,214
And now a bit of soap

128
00:26:56,672 --> 00:27:03,352
There is a man and he is called Rama
he's a very good man

129
00:27:03,387 --> 00:27:08,517
He helps everyone
he will help you too

130
00:27:10,519 --> 00:27:12,559
He's coming tomorrow morning

131
00:27:16,483 --> 00:27:19,493
Is he going to help me
look for my mum?

132
00:27:22,197 --> 00:27:24,777
He's going to help you
look for your mum

133
00:27:25,451 --> 00:27:27,871
Close your eyes go to sleep

134
00:27:30,122 --> 00:27:34,252
Sleep

135
00:27:37,504 --> 00:27:39,424
Sleep

136
00:27:49,683 --> 00:27:51,443
Oh, my baby

137
00:27:51,477 --> 00:27:53,307
Were you sleeping?

138
00:27:58,192 --> 00:28:01,362
I wonder what worlds you've travelled

139
00:28:02,029 --> 00:28:05,409
- Are you Rama?
- Yes, but not the God

140
00:28:25,844 --> 00:28:27,934
Come and lie down

141
00:28:30,474 --> 00:28:32,024
Come closer

142
00:28:33,686 --> 00:28:36,686
Do you know? I've come
to meet you from really far away

143
00:28:40,484 --> 00:28:43,204
and I want to take you
to a really nice place

144
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,740
Are you going to take me to Mum?

145
00:28:46,407 --> 00:28:49,787
And from there we're going to try
and look for your mum

146
00:28:50,452 --> 00:28:56,002
I'll be back tonight
and then we'll search

147
00:29:10,848 --> 00:29:12,428
Get up!

148
00:29:15,185 --> 00:29:16,645
Come closer

149
00:29:29,992 --> 00:29:31,827
Say "thank you"

150
00:29:31,828 --> 00:29:32,756
Thank you.

151
00:29:32,757 --> 00:29:33,757
Thank you

152
00:29:38,375 --> 00:29:39,995
You've done well

153
00:29:41,086 --> 00:29:43,506
He's exactly what they're
looking for come closer

154
00:30:04,526 --> 00:30:07,276
What happened? You didn't drink?

155
00:30:07,696 --> 00:30:09,776
You don't like it?

156
00:30:13,035 --> 00:30:15,325
Why are you down?

157
00:30:20,834 --> 00:30:22,674
Drink this

158
00:30:31,374 --> 00:30:33,644
Come closer..

159
00:30:50,965 --> 00:30:52,905
Saroo

160
00:30:59,582 --> 00:31:00,752
Saroo

161
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,760
Saroo!

162
00:32:06,982 --> 00:32:08,862
Good boy!

163
00:32:09,443 --> 00:32:12,403
Good boy!

164
00:32:14,782 --> 00:32:16,492
Go pick up the small ones

165
00:32:17,493 --> 00:32:19,543
Go pick up the small ones

166
00:32:20,621 --> 00:32:22,331
Good boy!

167
00:32:22,748 --> 00:32:24,668
Good boy

168
00:32:27,419 --> 00:32:29,549
Good boy

169
00:32:31,131 --> 00:32:34,181
Good boy! Good boy!

170
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:36,470
Good boy!

171
00:32:36,512 --> 00:32:38,512
Good boy!

172
00:32:40,683 --> 00:32:43,523
Who's my good boy? Who is it?

173
00:32:47,523 --> 00:32:50,153
I'm sorry, Mum

174
00:34:54,275 --> 00:34:57,275
So I came out of the cafe
and started talking to him

175
00:34:57,945 --> 00:35:00,025
I realized he doesn't speak
a word of Bengali

176
00:35:00,072 --> 00:35:01,622
He only speaks Hindi

177
00:35:02,074 --> 00:35:04,664
I asked him where he was from?

178
00:35:05,619 --> 00:35:10,169
He replied with only
one word "Ganestalay"

179
00:35:10,416 --> 00:35:12,536
I've never heard of it

180
00:35:14,753 --> 00:35:16,463
Ganestalay

181
00:35:19,383 --> 00:35:22,053
Okay, which district
is Ganestalay in?

182
00:35:22,094 --> 00:35:25,184
Which district is Ganestalay in?

183
00:35:28,392 --> 00:35:32,352
- What is your mother's name?
- Mum

184
00:35:39,506 --> 00:35:41,746
LOST

185
00:37:10,869 --> 00:37:13,999
- What's your name?
- Amita

186
00:37:18,168 --> 00:37:21,048
This is a very bad place

187
00:37:25,009 --> 00:37:27,509
Does anybody ever leave here?

188
00:37:27,553 --> 00:37:29,313
I've seen it

189
00:37:30,055 --> 00:37:34,885
- What are you going to do once you le
- I'm going to buy a watch

190
00:37:50,743 --> 00:37:52,913
Did you write it?

191
00:37:53,203 --> 00:37:56,333
Hey, Shonedeep!
What are you doing?

192
00:37:56,373 --> 00:37:58,173
Stop!

193
00:37:59,251 --> 00:38:03,171
- Stop! Stop right now!
- Shonedeep!

194
00:38:04,381 --> 00:38:06,721
Why are you being so naughty?

195
00:38:07,551 --> 00:38:08,841
Shonedeep!

196
00:38:09,303 --> 00:38:12,893
Come with me, I'm going
to give you a good beating!

197
00:38:12,932 --> 00:38:14,602
You won't get away with this!

198
00:38:31,492 --> 00:38:34,162
Hey! Shonedeep! Come on, come on!

199
00:38:34,536 --> 00:38:36,906
Shonedeep! Come on!

200
00:38:44,546 --> 00:38:47,926
Look this way, look this way

201
00:38:49,718 --> 00:38:53,758
It's me, it's okay, I'll take him

202
00:38:54,932 --> 00:38:57,942
Bring him back before morning

203
00:39:00,104 --> 00:39:08,104
All the stars came out
in search of the moon

204
00:39:11,824 --> 00:39:19,824
All the stars came out
in search of the moon

205
00:39:24,628 --> 00:39:32,628
The ill-fated came out
on the streets

206
00:39:36,473 --> 00:39:44,473
The stars came out
in search of the moon

207
00:39:47,568 --> 00:39:55,568
They came out in search of the thief

208
00:39:59,747 --> 00:40:04,127
The stars came out

209
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:23,810
Yes, Saroo, my name
is Mrs. Sood, come sit here

210
00:40:25,981 --> 00:40:30,781
It's my job to make sure that
there isn't a single kid here

211
00:40:31,904 --> 00:40:34,494
who should be somewhere else

212
00:40:35,658 --> 00:40:37,408
That's why I'm here

213
00:40:37,868 --> 00:40:40,578
People don't like me here

214
00:40:44,416 --> 00:40:45,666
Look at this

215
00:40:47,544 --> 00:40:51,094
We have been asking around
about you for a long time

216
00:40:51,131 --> 00:40:54,801
We have published it
in the newspaper

217
00:40:54,843 --> 00:40:56,853
In all the newspapers in Calcutta

218
00:40:57,888 --> 00:41:02,138
15 million people read this paper
that's a lot of people

219
00:41:03,936 --> 00:41:08,396
But we haven't
had a single reply

220
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:10,690
My home is really far

221
00:41:11,902 --> 00:41:14,322
Not one reply

222
00:41:15,281 --> 00:41:18,661
- What about Mum?
- No

223
00:41:19,451 --> 00:41:21,371
not even Mum

224
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,420
Guddu?

225
00:41:29,279 --> 00:41:30,459
Saroo...

226
00:41:30,595 --> 00:41:34,585
We have found a family over in Austral

227
00:41:34,633 --> 00:41:37,553
who want to look after you

228
00:41:38,554 --> 00:41:40,894
Do you know where Australia is?

229
00:41:41,765 --> 00:41:43,885
Would you like to see them?

230
00:41:44,518 --> 00:41:46,768
Come, I'll show you

231
00:41:48,647 --> 00:41:50,477
Come sit here

232
00:41:53,986 --> 00:41:56,946
Look, look at this, this is John

233
00:41:57,489 --> 00:41:59,369
and this is Sue

234
00:42:01,911 --> 00:42:03,791
This...

235
00:42:03,829 --> 00:42:06,459
This is their home

236
00:42:07,499 --> 00:42:09,709
They live in Tasmania

237
00:42:09,752 --> 00:42:12,632
A small island
and everyone there is really nice

238
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:18,140
They are such nice people!
Aren't they?

239
00:42:19,386 --> 00:42:24,676
Keep this with you
and keep it safe, ok?

240
00:42:27,639 --> 00:42:28,639
Saroo...

241
00:42:28,641 --> 00:42:32,571
Son, you can't stay here

242
00:42:46,997 --> 00:42:49,577
Did you really look for my mum?

243
00:42:53,003 --> 00:42:55,343
Looked everywhere

244
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:33,750
You'll have a nice home

245
00:43:34,003 --> 00:43:36,463
Australia is a great place

246
00:43:52,271 --> 00:43:53,941
Does everybody have a napkin?

247
00:43:53,981 --> 00:43:56,321
- This is called a "serviette"
- Serviette

248
00:43:56,358 --> 00:44:00,028
Lay it down on your lap like this
so that food doesn't fall on your clot

249
00:44:00,070 --> 00:44:01,360
So it doesn't ruin them

250
00:44:01,405 --> 00:44:05,235
I'm going to teach you how
to eat using cutlery

251
00:44:05,659 --> 00:44:09,579
I will ask you, and you will tell me
in English what each thing is called

252
00:44:09,622 --> 00:44:11,291
What do you call this?

253
00:44:11,292 --> 00:44:12,602
Fork.

254
00:44:12,628 --> 00:44:14,958
Fork. Yes good.

255
00:44:15,586 --> 00:44:18,666
- What do you call this?
- Nice

256
00:44:18,673 --> 00:44:19,673
Knife.

257
00:44:21,728 --> 00:44:23,208
Good.

258
00:44:23,210 --> 00:44:24,340
And this?

259
00:44:24,441 --> 00:44:27,681
Spoon.
Spoon.

260
00:44:29,099 --> 00:44:31,939
Okay, Manisha
you tell me, what is this?

261
00:44:32,353 --> 00:44:34,403
Try to remember

262
00:44:34,815 --> 00:44:36,215
Salt.
Salt.

263
00:44:36,355 --> 00:44:37,445
Very good.

264
00:44:39,447 --> 00:44:40,467
Payper!

265
00:44:42,070 --> 00:44:45,100
- Pepper.
- Pepper.

266
00:44:58,001 --> 00:44:59,031
Okay, okay.

267
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:49,500
HOBART, AUSTRALIA

268
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:54,700
Thank you.

269
00:46:00,585 --> 00:46:01,585
Saroo.

270
00:46:02,026 --> 00:46:04,446
This is your mum and dad

271
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:06,490
Say hello

272
00:46:12,947 --> 00:46:14,837
Hello, I'm Swarmina.

273
00:46:14,845 --> 00:46:17,155
Oh hello. I'm John, this is Sue.

274
00:46:19,898 --> 00:46:21,198
Hello there.

275
00:46:22,873 --> 00:46:25,693
Hello. Here this is for you.

276
00:46:29,001 --> 00:46:32,371
Good on the plane?
Eh, good?

277
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,490
Sue...

278
00:46:36,030 --> 00:46:37,520
- This is...
- Mummy and...

279
00:46:38,021 --> 00:46:39,081
Dad.

280
00:46:39,748 --> 00:46:42,088
And we're so happy to meet you.

281
00:46:54,490 --> 00:46:55,990
A boat.

282
00:47:07,632 --> 00:47:08,632
Amazing.

283
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:11,400
Gently... gently...

284
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:21,120
This is where you live.

285
00:47:23,045 --> 00:47:26,695
Down there, that's the living room.

286
00:47:31,450 --> 00:47:33,320
Television.

287
00:47:35,302 --> 00:47:37,612
Do you know what a television is?

288
00:47:39,530 --> 00:47:40,540
Pictures.

289
00:47:42,093 --> 00:47:43,903
Water.

290
00:47:45,229 --> 00:47:46,809
Water.

291
00:47:55,524 --> 00:47:56,624
You can open it.

292
00:48:17,995 --> 00:48:19,695
Do you want me to cut it up for him?

293
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:32,920
Payper!

294
00:48:33,739 --> 00:48:34,579
What was it?

295
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:36,600
Payper!

296
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:40,950
Yes, pepper.
That's right and...

297
00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:44,650

00:48:45,970 --> 00:48:47,010

299
00:48:48,330 --> 00:48:49,650
Very good.

300
00:49:04,969 --> 00:49:05,969
Hi.

301
00:49:10,510 --> 00:49:14,520
So, you've come a long way,
haven't you? Hmm?

302
00:49:16,954 --> 00:49:17,954
Little one.

303
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:21,890
I'm sure it hasn't been easy.

304
00:49:23,350 --> 00:49:25,880
One day you will tell me all about it.

305
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:29,900
You'll tell me everything.
Who you are, everything.

306
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:33,500
I'll always listen.

307
00:49:36,688 --> 00:49:37,688
Always.

308
00:49:54,202 --> 00:49:56,482
Stay, yeah yeah...

309
00:49:58,770 --> 00:50:01,270
Yeah, that's... that's it.

310
00:50:04,225 --> 00:50:06,395
- Go easy on me, yeah?
- Yeah.

311
00:50:07,657 --> 00:50:09,017
Okay mate.

312
00:50:09,051 --> 00:50:11,951
- Mum... Daddy...
- Pay attention.

313
00:50:14,012 --> 00:50:15,692
Here he comes! Come on mate!

314
00:50:24,418 --> 00:50:26,418
She's out!

315
00:50:27,350 --> 00:50:28,380
Oh my gosh!

316
00:50:28,495 --> 00:50:30,985
How did you do this to me?

317
00:50:33,634 --> 00:50:34,634
All right.

318
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:37,670
Dad, mum, Saroo...

319
00:50:38,860 --> 00:50:39,896

00:50:39,897 --> 00:50:40,897
Yes.

00:50:40,922 --> 00:50:42,922
Yeah.

00:50:43,580 --> 00:50:45,210
Hello again!

323
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:49,330
Aw, Saroo, my goodness, look at you!

Oh my gosh, we've been so excited!

326
00:50:52,965 --> 00:50:54,515
This is Mantosh.

He did a picture, Yeah...

334
00:51:23,274 --> 00:51:26,364
- It's been a long flight?
- Yes, Yes, Yes.

335
00:51:26,913 --> 00:51:28,253
You must be hungry.

336
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:29,840
We're going to get something to eat.

337
00:51:29,845 --> 00:51:32,875
Would you... like to join us?

338
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:34,400
Oh alright, Ok that would be nice.

339
00:51:44,198 --> 00:51:46,558
Stop, stop, stop, stop...

340
00:51:46,581 --> 00:51:49,581
No no no, It's alright.
I know it's Okay.

00:51:50,014 --> 00:51:51,384
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop!

00:51:51,410 --> 00:51:52,710
- Come on...

00:51:56,521 --> 00:51:59,461
- It's okay, Man...
- Just play with your toys.

345
00:51:59,497 --> 00:52:03,037
No, no, no, don't hit mate.

346
00:52:04,050 --> 00:52:06,550
Don't hit yourself. No no no..
Not your head.. Not your head.

347
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:09,320
- Come on
- You're right, you're right...

348
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:12,960
It's okay.

Come on, it's okay Man.

350
00:52:16,747 --> 00:52:22,147
Look, there's a boat.
It's better now.

351
00:52:55,010 --> 00:52:56,290
I'm okay.

352
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:14,990
Hey!

353
00:53:28,655 --> 00:53:30,355
I'm all right.

354
00:54:10,860 --> 00:54:13,450
This one.

355
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:16,120
- We're gonna miss you.
- Yeah.

356
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:18,220
It's only Melbourne.

357
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:20,930
Who is across the water?

358
00:54:22,460 --> 00:54:23,940
Saroo...

359
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:26,130
Our beautiful boy!

360
00:54:27,449 --> 00:54:30,209
May this bring you
all that you could wish for.

361
00:54:30,420 --> 00:54:32,298
Yeah, and then some.

362
00:54:32,299 --> 00:54:33,389
Thanks mum. Thanks dad.

363
00:54:34,021 --> 00:54:35,721
From the moment you
came into our lives...

364
00:54:35,722 --> 00:54:37,807
- Mum...
- No no no, let me finish.

365
00:54:37,930 --> 00:54:40,350
From the moment you
came into our lives...

366
00:54:40,830 --> 00:54:43,830
You were all that
we could have hoped for.

367
00:54:44,710 --> 00:54:48,620
More, more than we hoped for, really.

368
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:52,190
And, er, more work, that's for sure.

369
00:54:53,300 --> 00:54:55,320
You really embraced every opportunity.

370
00:54:55,790 --> 00:54:57,380
We're very proud of you, son.

371
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:02,480
Very proud and very excited with this
next chapter in your life.

372
00:55:05,290 --> 00:55:06,989
- To success!
- Excuse me guys?

373
00:55:06,990 --> 00:55:09,998
Are you still waiting on someone?
Or can I take this plate away?

374
00:55:10,036 --> 00:55:12,466
- Yeah, you can take it away.
- No no no, you can leave it.

375
00:55:12,468 --> 00:55:13,518
No, take it.

376
00:55:13,750 --> 00:55:16,210
I'd like to keep it.
Thank you.

377
00:55:23,220 --> 00:55:25,460
You don't really think
he will turn up, do you?

378
00:55:25,465 --> 00:55:27,205
No, just leave it, son.

379
00:55:32,632 --> 00:55:33,812
That's a nice one.

380
00:55:33,833 --> 00:55:35,963
- Yeah it's a good one.
- This one's a local one.

381
00:55:52,785 --> 00:55:53,855
Mantosh?

382
00:56:14,260 --> 00:56:15,340
Yeah...

383
00:56:15,570 --> 00:56:17,100
Sorry, I didn't meet lunch.

384
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:21,580
What's that course again?

385
00:56:21,980 --> 00:56:23,420
Hotel Management.

386
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:26,700
So you're going when to do what?

387
00:56:27,740 --> 00:56:29,760
Manage a hotel!

388
00:56:31,630 --> 00:56:32,820
Well... have fun!

389
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:35,990
Any bills you need to pay?

390
00:56:36,370 --> 00:56:38,030
You can give us a job
when you come back.

391
00:56:38,031 --> 00:56:40,301
Please could you not do
anything while I'm away?

392
00:56:40,302 --> 00:56:41,317
Yeah Yeah...

393
00:56:41,370 --> 00:56:43,820
that's going to make mum
more unhappy than you already do.

394
00:56:44,370 --> 00:56:45,800
Mate...

395
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:49,610
Why do you think I stay away?

396
00:57:08,285 --> 00:57:12,505
We see ourselves as United Nations
of hospitality schools.

397
00:57:12,544 --> 00:57:16,524
And we'd like to think we teach
a global and balanced perspective.

398
00:57:17,379 --> 00:57:19,269
You're here because
you have a dream.

399
00:57:19,590 --> 00:57:23,210
We're here to help make
that dream a reality.

400
00:57:41,580 --> 00:57:44,890
Yeah and I saw firsthand how
the hospitality industry

401
00:57:44,894 --> 00:57:48,624
can really bring infrastructure to
communities that need it.

402
00:57:48,700 --> 00:57:51,659
But I also saw a lot of problems
that they cause,

403
00:57:51,660 --> 00:57:56,368
which is why community groups need to
be, involved every step of the way,

404
00:57:56,402 --> 00:57:58,582
and they need to be taken seriously.

405
00:57:58,678 --> 00:58:00,068
And?

406
00:58:00,100 --> 00:58:03,780
I guess I want to help facilitate that
and help give them a voice.

407
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:05,020
Saroo.

408
00:58:06,690 --> 00:58:09,990
I want to run hotels, so I put
all the profits into my pocket.

409
00:58:09,994 --> 00:58:12,612
Well, let me ask and start with
where you are from? Shall we?

410
00:58:12,613 --> 00:58:13,948
So, born in Australia?

411
00:58:13,949 --> 00:58:15,219
Yeah No, er...

412
00:58:15,874 --> 00:58:16,944
Calcutta.

413
00:58:17,070 --> 00:58:20,000
I've got family in Calcutta.
My cousins are quite...

414
00:58:20,003 --> 00:58:21,033
Which part?

415
00:58:22,010 --> 00:58:24,760
I'm adopted. I'm not really Indian.

416
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:29,440
But you like cricket though, right?

417
00:58:31,348 --> 00:58:33,108
Ah, you like cricket...

418
00:58:33,713 --> 00:58:35,283
You go for the Aussies or the Indians?

419
00:58:35,321 --> 00:58:36,631
Only the Aussies, mate!

420
00:58:37,950 --> 00:58:39,950
<i>Only the Aussies, mate!</i>

421
00:58:40,566 --> 00:58:41,926
This is going to be interesting.

422
00:58:41,930 --> 00:58:43,490
Okay, Saroo...

423
00:58:44,202 --> 00:58:45,722
Why did you choose this course?

424
00:58:45,810 --> 00:58:47,750
What else do you want to
get out of it?

425
00:59:34,110 --> 00:59:35,609
Hi, Hey!

426
00:59:35,610 --> 00:59:38,420
- Welcome.
- Come in. Come in.

427
00:59:40,931 --> 00:59:41,931
Hi!

428
00:59:42,030 --> 00:59:44,320
Hi, how are you?

429
00:59:44,875 --> 00:59:46,805
Do you guys like Indian food?

430
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:50,800
That's all we have.
That's all we have.

431
00:59:51,270 --> 00:59:54,070
- It smells so great.
- I tried to copy from someone...

432
00:59:56,690 --> 00:59:58,290
You've ever done Bollywood dance?

433
00:59:58,315 --> 01:00:00,415
- Oh, just like, one leg.
- Yeah, one leg...

434
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:06,340
Where I grew up, I say flashlight.
What do you say?

435
01:00:06,374 --> 01:00:09,279
- Lampo de poche.
- Lampo de poche?

436
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:10,300
- Flashlight
- Flashlight

437
01:00:10,470 --> 01:00:12,910
- Lampo de poche.
- Flashlight is er...(Indian word)

438
01:00:13,330 --> 01:00:14,740
What do you say?

439
01:00:14,810 --> 01:00:15,820
Torch.

440
01:00:15,855 --> 01:00:17,275
If you want to eat with your hands,

441
01:00:17,277 --> 01:00:20,257
you need to use the naan,
like a spoon.

442
01:00:20,296 --> 01:00:22,196
- Use a fork.
- No, let him use the naan.

443
01:00:22,821 --> 01:00:24,191
So how do you say taxi?

444
01:00:24,850 --> 01:00:25,930
- Taxi.
- Taxi.

445
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:28,080
It is the same in every language.

446
01:00:28,085 --> 01:00:29,415
Do you want a fork, Saroo?

447
01:00:29,442 --> 01:00:31,442
Yeah!

448
01:00:32,077 --> 01:00:33,407
He's like my father.

449
01:00:35,540 --> 01:00:38,060
- You want another beer?
- Yes please, thank you.

450
01:01:01,388 --> 01:01:02,838
Guddu, I want some jalebi.

451
01:01:02,842 --> 01:01:04,052
Guddu, jalebis

452
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:26,200
Hello...

453
01:01:31,900 --> 01:01:33,190
You okay?

454
01:01:41,972 --> 01:01:43,312
Saroo?

455
01:01:48,060 --> 01:01:50,060
I'm not from Calcutta.

456
01:01:53,850 --> 01:01:54,920
I'm lost.

457
01:01:56,780 --> 01:01:59,340
Howrah station is enormous,
you must have been freaking out.

458
01:02:00,040 --> 01:02:02,200
I once went through there
on a pilgrimage to Puri,

459
01:02:02,227 --> 01:02:04,147
and I missed my connection twice.

460
01:02:04,620 --> 01:02:06,280
And you didn't speak Bengali?

461
01:02:06,980 --> 01:02:08,730
I didn't even know it was called that.

462
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:12,460
- How long were you on the train?
- A couple of days.

463
01:02:12,464 --> 01:02:13,474
A couple of days?

464
01:02:14,680 --> 01:02:16,730
Saroo, what was your hometown again?

465
01:02:16,731 --> 01:02:17,757
Ganestlay.

466
01:02:19,620 --> 01:02:22,670
I must have had it wrong
because it doesn't exist.

467
01:02:22,672 --> 01:02:24,982
But there must be something else
that you do remember.

468
01:02:28,730 --> 01:02:30,020
The platform...

469
01:02:30,780 --> 01:02:33,770
I fell asleep on,
there's a big rain tank.

470
01:02:33,801 --> 01:02:36,351
It was only a few stops
from Ganestlay.

471
01:02:37,460 --> 01:02:40,050
There are thousands of
stations with rain tanks.

472
01:02:40,051 --> 01:02:42,068
Okay, it was a long time ago.

473
01:02:42,083 --> 01:02:44,223
Have you heard of this new
program, Google Earth?

474
01:02:44,740 --> 01:02:47,239
It's incredible, you can find
any place from anywhere.

475
01:02:47,240 --> 01:02:51,488
Listen to me, we can find out how
fast passenger trains went back then.

476
01:02:51,489 --> 01:02:55,185
We take that speed, multiply by
the hours that you were on the train.

477
01:02:55,186 --> 01:02:56,426
That's it!

478
01:02:56,570 --> 01:02:58,180
We create a search radius.

479
01:02:58,420 --> 01:03:00,950
And inside there, you will find
the station with the rain tank.

480
01:03:00,985 --> 01:03:04,375
Yeah, but it will take a lifetime
to search all the stations in India.

481
01:03:04,412 --> 01:03:06,602
Did I say all the stations?

482
01:03:06,630 --> 01:03:07,780
Ok, even half the stations..

483
01:03:07,804 --> 01:03:09,824
Really guys,
I don't want to talk about this.

484
01:03:12,010 --> 01:03:13,800
Did your parents
try to find you?

485
01:03:13,890 --> 01:03:15,820
- What?
- They tried to find him.

486
01:03:16,260 --> 01:03:17,080
No I just mean like,

487
01:03:17,103 --> 01:03:19,743
if they tried to find him,
maybe they left like a paper trail.

488
01:03:19,830 --> 01:03:21,360
What paper trail?

489
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:24,670
- He didn't know his surname.
- My mum couldn't read or write.

490
01:03:24,890 --> 01:03:26,320
What does she do?

491
01:03:26,690 --> 01:03:28,550
A labourer, she carried rocks.

492
01:03:28,560 --> 01:03:29,600
Your mum?

493
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:38,980
My mom died about four years ago now.

494
01:03:39,581 --> 01:03:40,751
I'm sorry.

495
01:03:41,575 --> 01:03:44,395
My dad is still so angry at her.

496
01:03:44,725 --> 01:03:46,095
Not for getting sick, obviously...

497
01:03:46,132 --> 01:03:48,972
but just for refusing chemo.

498
01:03:50,860 --> 01:03:54,730
But she just knew herself, you know?
She knew what her terms were

499
01:03:54,759 --> 01:03:57,069
and she knew how
she wanted to live, so...

500
01:03:59,433 --> 01:04:01,193
Just couldn't accept that, I guess.

501
01:04:04,894 --> 01:04:06,434
And how do you feel?

502
01:04:07,170 --> 01:04:09,260
I miss her.

503
01:04:12,514 --> 01:04:15,334
And what do you think of
Bharat's search radius idea?

504
01:04:24,499 --> 01:04:25,499
What was that?

505
01:04:27,870 --> 01:04:31,290
Is that your dance?
Is that how you dance?

506
01:04:31,868 --> 01:04:32,868
Oh, God!

507
01:06:56,842 --> 01:06:58,202
Hey.

508
01:07:37,090 --> 01:07:39,070
You can't keep going on like this.

509
01:07:42,006 --> 01:07:43,366
Let me help you.

510
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:50,690
Let's go for a run.

511
01:07:52,834 --> 01:07:53,834
What?

512
01:08:00,080 --> 01:08:01,120
Lucy!

513
01:08:09,043 --> 01:08:10,043
Come here.

514
01:08:11,779 --> 01:08:12,779
Hold on.

515
01:08:12,980 --> 01:08:14,010
Got a cramp.

516
01:08:16,550 --> 01:08:18,890
You lied! You cheat.

517
01:09:24,085 --> 01:09:25,685
I never show anybody this.

518
01:09:26,087 --> 01:09:27,687
Okay, they're beautiful.

519
01:09:28,889 --> 01:09:32,089
I do enjoy it.
My little hobby.

520
01:09:33,427 --> 01:09:35,757
- Oh wow, look at Mantosh!
- Uh huh.

521
01:09:36,338 --> 01:09:38,178
I'm so glad he's coming tonight.

522
01:09:38,905 --> 01:09:40,905
Cheeky little thing.

523
01:09:41,168 --> 01:09:42,198
Pure energy.

524
01:09:44,171 --> 01:09:45,171
But incredible.

525
01:09:46,440 --> 01:09:47,710
So sweet!

526
01:09:48,943 --> 01:09:50,643
He's been hard to control, but...

527
01:09:51,378 --> 01:09:54,578
very, very smart... and very...

528
01:09:55,149 --> 01:09:59,019
I mean, he could do anything if he just
learned to control that energy.

529
01:09:59,253 --> 01:10:00,553
He could do it, and do it all.

530
01:10:01,822 --> 01:10:03,662
Saroo is very protective of him.

531
01:10:08,462 --> 01:10:09,562
I've been blessed.

532
01:10:14,435 --> 01:10:15,435
Very blessed.

533
01:10:17,071 --> 01:10:20,211
Your mom showed me
all your old little trophies.

534
01:10:21,342 --> 01:10:22,342
Mum, you didn't.

535
01:10:24,145 --> 01:10:26,275
I didn't know you were so athletic.

536
01:10:26,380 --> 01:10:28,980
That's only half of them.
There's plenty more in the garage.

537
01:10:29,683 --> 01:10:31,053
Hey, where you going, mate?

538
01:10:31,685 --> 01:10:33,085
Finishing my smoke.

539
01:10:33,854 --> 01:10:35,004
I can barely get him off...

540
01:10:35,022 --> 01:10:36,962
the couch these days.
- Lucy!

541
01:10:42,630 --> 01:10:43,753
Why can't you just tell them...

542
01:10:43,777 --> 01:10:46,187
what you've been up to?
- Don't!

543
01:10:47,201 --> 01:10:48,241
Tell us.

544
01:10:48,803 --> 01:10:50,873
They will understand and
they will support you.

545
01:10:50,940 --> 01:10:52,540
What? Come on.

546
01:10:53,175 --> 01:10:55,175
Hey, um, dinner!

547
01:10:56,477 --> 01:10:57,807
Better eat it, while it's hot.

548
01:11:00,281 --> 01:11:02,981
- You hungry?
- Yeah.

549
01:11:04,785 --> 01:11:05,785
What?

550
01:11:08,155 --> 01:11:09,175
What have I missed?

551
01:11:09,390 --> 01:11:10,390
Nothing.

552
01:11:11,425 --> 01:11:13,125
- She looks upset.
- She's not upset!

553
01:11:13,194 --> 01:11:14,434
You and I are leaving.

554
01:11:16,897 --> 01:11:18,507
Saroo knows everything.

555
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:21,400
- He's an expert.
- Uh oh!

556
01:11:22,436 --> 01:11:23,636
He's a manager.

557
01:11:25,372 --> 01:11:26,602
Why are you here?

558
01:11:28,342 --> 01:11:30,052
He's here because
he's your brother.

559
01:11:30,344 --> 01:11:31,404
No, he's not.

560
01:11:39,019 --> 01:11:41,289
- We're different.
- Hey, now now, Saroo!

561
01:11:41,455 --> 01:11:42,455
Saroo...

562
01:11:49,830 --> 01:11:50,830
All right.

563
01:11:55,636 --> 01:11:56,636
It's all right.

564
01:11:59,407 --> 01:12:00,407
Hey hey, no no...

565
01:12:04,011 --> 01:12:06,851
It's all right, It's all right...
Stop!

566
01:12:08,148 --> 01:12:09,248
Don't move.

567
01:12:10,418 --> 01:12:12,148
It's okay.

568
01:12:13,320 --> 01:12:14,320
Nice one, mate.

569
01:12:17,145 --> 01:12:21,445
It's okay mate, It's okay,
just breathe, mate. Just breathe...

570
01:12:28,536 --> 01:12:31,436
I hate what he's done to you.

571
01:13:05,639 --> 01:13:06,639
I'm sorry.

572
01:13:24,668 --> 01:13:25,958
Saroo!

573
01:13:27,728 --> 01:13:28,797
Saroo.

574
01:13:28,798 --> 01:13:29,798
Saroo!

575
01:13:30,464 --> 01:13:32,804
Saroo!

576
01:13:55,890 --> 01:13:56,890
Hey!

577
01:14:35,429 --> 01:14:36,559
Hey...

578
01:14:41,736 --> 01:14:42,796
Kiss me.

579
01:14:47,141 --> 01:14:49,401
- Stop, please.
- Hey!

580
01:14:49,431 --> 01:14:51,281
Look at me.

581
01:14:54,148 --> 01:14:55,398
Look at me!

582
01:14:55,883 --> 01:14:57,323
- Can this wait?
- Where are you?

583
01:14:57,485 --> 01:14:59,515
Can this wait 'til we get home?

584
01:14:59,887 --> 01:15:01,467
- Yah?
- Home?

585
01:15:03,858 --> 01:15:04,858
What home?

586
01:15:05,593 --> 01:15:08,703
You mean, where I'm alone in one room
and you're alone in another room?

587
01:15:08,896 --> 01:15:09,896
Come on.

588
01:15:10,731 --> 01:15:12,331
Stop, Luce. Stop it.

589
01:15:13,667 --> 01:15:14,667
Come on.

590
01:15:15,236 --> 01:15:16,236
Please.

591
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:20,440
Saroo!

592
01:15:20,775 --> 01:15:22,775
You need to face reality!

593
01:15:24,378 --> 01:15:25,998
What do you mean? Reality?

594
01:15:27,648 --> 01:15:31,968
You have any idea what it's like
knowing my real brother...

595
01:15:32,004 --> 01:15:35,164
and mother spend everyday
of their lives looking for me?

596
01:15:37,992 --> 01:15:40,802
How every day my real
brother screams my name!

597
01:15:43,330 --> 01:15:46,800
Can you imagine the pain they
must be in for not knowing where I am?

598
01:15:47,034 --> 01:15:50,324
25 years, Luce.
25!

599
01:15:51,906 --> 01:15:54,276
Why didn't you tell me
that's was happening for you?

600
01:15:54,708 --> 01:15:56,478
And we swung about in our...

601
01:15:57,178 --> 01:15:58,308
privileged lives.

602
01:16:01,348 --> 01:16:02,348
It makes me sick.

603
01:16:03,517 --> 01:16:04,787
I have to find home.

604
01:16:05,319 --> 01:16:07,049
They need to know, okay?

605
01:16:07,555 --> 01:16:09,055
I've never stopped you.

606
01:16:09,590 --> 01:16:10,760
I want to help.

607
01:16:11,125 --> 01:16:12,325
I can't do this anymore.

608
01:16:13,360 --> 01:16:14,560
You deserve more.

609
01:16:15,429 --> 01:16:16,459
Don't you do that!

610
01:16:18,599 --> 01:16:22,099
Don't you dare do that!
This is on you, not on me.

611
01:19:25,820 --> 01:19:27,490
Saroo, you there, mate?

612
01:19:30,057 --> 01:19:33,307
It's One Day International (cricket)
tomorrow. You can come over if you like?

613
01:19:35,396 --> 01:19:37,426
I meant to tell you,
I fixed the tiller.

614
01:19:38,966 --> 01:19:41,146
Why don't we take her out?
We can head up the coast?

615
01:19:45,473 --> 01:19:46,613
Hey, Saroo...

616
01:19:47,475 --> 01:19:49,235
Mate, your mum's not, um,

617
01:19:50,811 --> 01:19:53,381
look, we've lost track of Mantosh,
he's missing again.

618
01:19:54,582 --> 01:19:55,922
You know how worried she gets.

619
01:20:04,825 --> 01:20:06,725
We know you quit your job, mate.

620
01:20:08,195 --> 01:20:09,655
Just worried about you, son.

621
01:20:51,505 --> 01:20:53,335
I've been visiting her.

622
01:20:55,276 --> 01:20:58,916
Every night I walk
those streets home.

623
01:21:00,448 --> 01:21:01,578
Home from the dam.

624
01:21:02,683 --> 01:21:03,853
Home from the station.

625
01:21:05,953 --> 01:21:06,953
I know now...

626
01:21:08,456 --> 01:21:10,016
every single step of the way.

627
01:21:12,927 --> 01:21:14,127
And I imagine that I'm...

628
01:21:16,630 --> 01:21:18,170
whispering in her ear...

629
01:21:18,799 --> 01:21:20,869
I'm here, it's alright.

630
01:21:23,804 --> 01:21:24,804
What was she like?

631
01:21:27,007 --> 01:21:28,007
Beautiful.

632
01:21:33,814 --> 01:21:34,824
How was New York?

633
01:21:35,549 --> 01:21:36,549
It's the same.

634
01:21:38,819 --> 01:21:39,949
So, what brings you back?

635
01:21:41,856 --> 01:21:43,216
My funding came through.

636
01:21:44,525 --> 01:21:45,525
It's great!

637
01:21:45,826 --> 01:21:46,826
See...

638
01:21:47,528 --> 01:21:48,828
They know how good you are.

639
01:22:01,942 --> 01:22:02,942
I miss you.

640
01:22:05,813 --> 01:22:06,913
I saw your mom.

641
01:22:08,449 --> 01:22:10,479
She's not doing very well.

642
01:22:11,619 --> 01:22:14,319
I'm worried, it would kill her
if she knew I was searching.

643
01:22:15,489 --> 01:22:16,819
You underestimate her.

644
01:22:17,792 --> 01:22:18,792
She needs you.

645
01:22:30,381 --> 01:22:33,431
No, give me five rupees
then I'll carry them all

646
01:22:33,467 --> 01:22:37,507
Okay, you win, take this

647
01:22:45,938 --> 01:22:48,728
He was carrying a watermelon
and didn't see it coming

648
01:23:09,744 --> 01:23:10,814
What?

649
01:23:13,147 --> 01:23:15,847
What if you do find home
and they're not even there?

650
01:23:19,186 --> 01:23:21,456
And you never stop and keep searching?

651
01:23:23,791 --> 01:23:25,541
And you don't know what happens over time,

652
01:23:27,294 --> 01:23:29,634
things change, and entire worlds change.

653
01:23:30,898 --> 01:23:32,228
I don't have a choice.

654
01:23:47,648 --> 01:23:49,718
Stay.

655
01:23:53,954 --> 01:23:55,454
I can't.

656
01:24:17,404 --> 01:24:18,954
Stay right there

657
01:24:20,366 --> 01:24:22,736
Weren't you supposed
to look after him?

658
01:24:23,244 --> 01:24:24,954
Where were you?

659
01:24:24,995 --> 01:24:26,785
Don't you love him?

660
01:24:51,045 --> 01:24:53,375
John heard Mantosh
is out on the boats.

661
01:24:59,220 --> 01:25:00,690
Doing a lobster run.

662
01:25:07,795 --> 01:25:09,425
He's due back tomorrow.

663
01:25:14,034 --> 01:25:16,744
So he'll be flushed with cash,
back on the hard stuff.

664
01:25:22,209 --> 01:25:23,939
I'm sorry you couldn't have your own kids.

665
01:25:27,815 --> 01:25:28,915
What are you saying?

666
01:25:28,983 --> 01:25:29,983
We...

667
01:25:30,918 --> 01:25:31,918
We...

668
01:25:34,121 --> 01:25:35,921
weren't blank pages, were we?

669
01:25:36,991 --> 01:25:38,361
Like your own would have been.

670
01:25:40,895 --> 01:25:43,655
You weren't just adopting us
but our past as well.

671
01:25:46,400 --> 01:25:50,000
- I feel like, we're killing you.
- I could have had kids.

672
01:25:53,207 --> 01:25:54,207
What?

673
01:25:54,408 --> 01:25:55,738
We chose not to have kids.

674
01:25:58,312 --> 01:25:59,882
We wanted the two of you.

675
01:26:01,348 --> 01:26:02,518
That's what we wanted.

676
01:26:03,784 --> 01:26:07,408
We wanted the two of you in our lives.

677
01:26:07,409 --> 01:26:09,059
That's what we chose.

678
01:26:17,331 --> 01:26:20,021
That's one of the reasons,
I fell in love with your dad.

679
01:26:21,035 --> 01:26:23,065
Because we both felt, as if...

680
01:26:24,772 --> 01:26:26,772
the world has enough people in it.

681
01:26:30,644 --> 01:26:33,584
Have a child, couldn't guarantee
it will make anything better.

682
01:26:33,615 --> 01:26:36,515
But to take a child that's suffering
like you boys were.

683
01:26:39,520 --> 01:26:41,220
Give you a chance in the world.

684
01:26:43,657 --> 01:26:44,827
That's something.

685
01:26:45,659 --> 01:26:47,829
I bet you never imagined
it being this hard.

686
01:26:48,229 --> 01:26:49,899
It's not a matter of hard.

687
01:26:50,498 --> 01:26:51,698
It's not a mat...

688
01:26:56,504 --> 01:26:58,374
There's only one path for me.

689
01:26:59,240 --> 01:27:00,470
And, that's how I think.

690
01:27:02,376 --> 01:27:04,106
That's how this happened because...

691
01:27:07,448 --> 01:27:08,948
When I was 12,

692
01:27:09,717 --> 01:27:10,947
I had a vision.

693
01:27:18,692 --> 01:27:22,232
Some people would say,
it was a breakdown. But it...

694
01:27:25,533 --> 01:27:28,803
My dad was an alcoholic.
You know that, and he was like

695
01:27:29,937 --> 01:27:32,167
he wasn't a good man.

696
01:27:33,340 --> 01:27:34,780
He was out of control when I was...

697
01:27:37,211 --> 01:27:40,981
I was standing at the back of the house.
I was looking out across this field.

698
01:27:43,717 --> 01:27:46,517
And I just wanted the
earth to swallow me up.

699
01:27:48,622 --> 01:27:49,722
And I...

700
01:27:55,930 --> 01:27:59,470
I felt an electric current,
it was like a shock,

701
01:27:59,633 --> 01:28:01,603
like a jolt through my whole body.

702
01:28:02,770 --> 01:28:03,900
And then I saw...

703
01:28:04,305 --> 01:28:05,805
A brown skinned child

704
01:28:06,474 --> 01:28:07,784
across that field.

705
01:28:13,380 --> 01:28:15,250
And he was standing beside me.

706
01:28:15,649 --> 01:28:20,149
And it was right there and I could
feel it so strongly.

707
01:28:22,890 --> 01:28:26,590
And for the first time in my
life I felt something good...

708
01:28:27,061 --> 01:28:29,971
I felt good.

709
01:28:32,032 --> 01:28:34,772
And I knew it was guiding me.

710
01:28:34,902 --> 01:28:37,812
And I knew that
I was going to be fine.

711
01:28:40,808 --> 01:28:45,378
It was, as if, that moment I could
see my future, right there!

712
01:28:46,847 --> 01:28:50,787
Because I always thought that
I could keep this family together.

713
01:28:51,819 --> 01:28:52,819
And now...

714
01:28:53,921 --> 01:28:55,221
Now I don't know.

715
01:28:56,056 --> 01:28:57,056
Where...

716
01:28:57,458 --> 01:29:00,088
- Mum...
- What's happening? I don't understand.

717
01:29:05,499 --> 01:29:07,599
You don't talk to me any more.

718
01:29:17,645 --> 01:29:19,145
I need you, Saroo.

719
01:29:58,652 --> 01:29:59,652
Mantosh!

720
01:30:10,197 --> 01:30:12,067
Sorry for what I said at dinner.

721
01:35:52,840 --> 01:35:54,580
Ganesh Talai...

722
01:35:56,777 --> 01:35:58,877
Ganesh Talai.

723
01:36:01,549 --> 01:36:02,549
Ganestlay!

724
01:36:57,456 --> 01:36:59,036
Mum

725
01:37:27,368 --> 01:37:28,538
I found home!

726
01:37:31,405 --> 01:37:33,535
What?

727
01:37:43,884 --> 01:37:44,924
Please wait for me.

728
01:37:49,790 --> 01:37:50,930
I'm here.

729
01:37:58,799 --> 01:38:00,669
So this is where you've been.

730
01:38:02,803 --> 01:38:04,773
I don't want you to feel,
I was ungrateful.

731
01:38:08,042 --> 01:38:10,212
There wasn't a day,
I didn't want to tell you.

732
01:38:14,215 --> 01:38:15,875
Saroo.

733
01:38:17,918 --> 01:38:19,518
I really hope she's there.

734
01:38:23,591 --> 01:38:26,091
She needs to see
how beautiful you are!

735
01:42:20,321 --> 01:42:21,701
Hey

736
01:42:24,365 --> 01:42:27,295
Hi, I used to live here.

737
01:42:30,071 --> 01:42:31,341
I... used to...

738
01:42:33,040 --> 01:42:34,040
Can I help?

739
01:42:38,579 --> 01:42:40,379
That's me. I'm Saroo.

740
01:42:40,915 --> 01:42:41,915
I used to live here.

741
01:42:42,550 --> 01:42:44,520
- You lived here?
- Yes I used to live here.

742
01:42:45,286 --> 01:42:49,216
I'm looking for Guddu,
Kallu, Shekila.

743
01:42:49,657 --> 01:42:50,657
My mother.

744
01:43:25,192 --> 01:43:26,192
Come.

745
01:43:26,694 --> 01:43:27,694
Come where?

746
01:43:28,162 --> 01:43:29,302
Come with me.

747
01:43:29,764 --> 01:43:30,764
Just come.

748
01:44:55,935 --> 01:44:57,555
Saroo!

749
01:45:07,562 --> 01:45:08,562
Mum.

750
01:45:08,564 --> 01:45:09,564
Mum?

751
01:45:09,597 --> 01:45:10,657
Saroo?

752
01:45:10,666 --> 01:45:11,826
Saroo?

753
01:45:13,768 --> 01:45:14,768
Saroo...

754
01:45:14,770 --> 01:45:15,770
Saroo!

755
01:45:18,207 --> 01:45:19,667
Saroo!

756
01:45:24,588 --> 01:45:27,298
Oh, how I looked for you!

757
01:45:39,927 --> 01:45:40,927
I'm sorry.

758
01:45:42,430 --> 01:45:43,590
I'm so sorry.

759
01:45:58,727 --> 01:46:00,687
Yes, the watermelon.

760
01:46:01,250 --> 01:46:02,370
Watermelon

761
01:46:02,417 --> 01:46:04,167
Tarabuja!
Yes, Tarabuja!

762
01:46:04,295 --> 01:46:08,255
Watermelon...

763
01:46:25,606 --> 01:46:26,606
Guddu?

764
01:46:26,608 --> 01:46:27,608
And Guddu?

765
01:46:27,708 --> 01:46:28,708
Where is Guddu?

766
01:46:32,246 --> 01:46:33,246
Where is he?

767
01:46:39,186 --> 01:46:40,486
Guddu is no more.

768
01:46:41,322 --> 01:46:43,022
He is with God.

769
01:47:34,875 --> 01:47:35,875
Shekila.

770
01:47:35,877 --> 01:47:36,807
- Shekila
- Shekila

771
01:47:36,807 --> 01:47:37,807
Shekila?

772
01:47:39,080 --> 01:47:40,080
Shekila?

773
01:47:40,083 --> 01:47:40,933
Shekila?

774
01:47:40,975 --> 01:47:42,805
- Shekila?
- He's your brother!

775
01:47:42,900 --> 01:47:44,700
She's so big!

776
01:47:44,819 --> 01:47:45,989
It's me, Saroo.

777
01:47:47,755 --> 01:47:48,755
Beautiful.

778
01:48:44,278 --> 01:48:45,348
Hi, mum.

779
01:48:46,147 --> 01:48:47,647
I know you will be sound asleep.

780
01:48:48,382 --> 01:48:50,122
I just want to say that I'm safe.

781
01:48:51,786 --> 01:48:54,116
I'm safe and the questions
have been answered.

782
01:48:56,390 --> 01:48:57,790
There are no more dead-ends.

783
01:48:59,960 --> 01:49:01,230
I found my mother, and...

784
01:49:01,762 --> 01:49:03,702
she thanks you both for raising me.

785
01:49:05,332 --> 01:49:07,072
She understands that
you are my family.

786
01:49:08,235 --> 01:49:12,925
She's... happy,
just knowing I'm alive.

787
01:49:15,476 --> 01:49:18,206
I found her, but that doesn't change
who you are.

788
01:49:19,914 --> 01:49:20,924
I love you mum...

789
01:49:21,482 --> 01:49:22,622
so much.

790
01:49:23,584 --> 01:49:24,584
And you, Dad.

791
01:49:25,786 --> 01:49:27,236
And Mantosh.

792
01:50:39,987 --> 01:50:41,317
C'mon!

793
01:50:41,572 --> 01:50:43,162
Let's go!

794
01:50:46,035 --> 01:50:47,405
Come on!

795
01:50:58,319 --> 01:50:59,879
Saroo!

796
01:51:02,885 --> 01:51:04,295
Let's go!

797
01:51:04,553 --> 01:51:05,893
Walk faster!

798
01:51:07,389 --> 01:51:12,349
I'm going, I'm going, I'm going!
