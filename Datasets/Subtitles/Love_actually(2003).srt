00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:15,320
'Whenever I get gloomy
with the state of the world,

2
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:18,540
'I think about the arrivals gate
at Heathrow airport.

3
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:22,500
'General opinion makes out
that we live in a world of hatred and greed

4
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:24,250
'but I don't see that.

5
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:26,920
'Seems to me that love is everywhere.

00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:31,550
'Often it's not particularly dignified
or newsworthy but it's always there.

7
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:35,260
'Fathers and sons, mothers and daughters,
husbands and wives,

'When the planes hit the Twin Towers,

'none of the phone calls from people on
board were messages of hate or revenge,

00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:47,650
'they were all messages of love.

12
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:54,200
'lf you look for it, I've got a sneaky feeling
you'll find that love actually is all around.'

13
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:12,510
I feel it in my fingers

14
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:15,760
I feel it in my toes

15
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:20,390
Feel it in my toes, yeah

16
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:25,020
Love is all around me
And so the...

17
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:27,980
I'm afraid you did it again, Bill.

18
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:32,440
It's just I know the old version
so well, you know.

19
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,780
Well, we all do.

20
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:37,240
That's why we're making the new version.

21
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,030
Right, OK, let's go.

22
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,870
I feel it in my fingers
In my fingers

23
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:49,080
I feel it in my toes

24
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:53,590
Feel it in my toes, yeah

25
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:56,220
Love is all ar...

26
00:02:56,260 --> 00:03:00,140
Oh, fuck, wank, bugger,
shitting arsehead and hole.

27
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,270
Start again.

28
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:12,610
I feel it in my fingers
In my fingers

29
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:15,650
I feel it in my toes

30
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:20,450
Feel it in my toes, yeah

31
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:23,990
Christmas is all around me
All around me

32
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:27,250
And so the feeling grows

33
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:31,790
So the feeling grows

34
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,340
It's written in the wind
In the wind

35
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:38,050
It's everywhere I go

36
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:42,850
Everywhere I go

37
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:46,600
So if you really love Christmas
Love Christmas

38
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,270
Come on and let it snow

39
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:51,350
Come on and let it...

40
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,690
This is shit, isn't it?

41
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:56,440
Yep, solid gold shit, maestro.

42
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:24,180
- God, I'm so late.
- It's just round the corner, you'll make it.

43
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:27,520
You sure you don't mind
me going without you?

44
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,980
No, really. I'm just feeling so rotten.

45
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:32,730
- I love you.
- I know.

46
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:36,940
I love you even when you're sick
and look disgusting.

47
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:40,490
I know. Now, go or you will actually miss it.

48
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,320
Right.

49
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,660
- Did I mention that I love you?
- Yes, you did. Get out, loser.

50
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:09,720
Karen, it's me again.

51
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:14,350
I'm sorry, I literally don't have
anybody else to talk to.

52
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:18,570
Absolutely. Horrible moment, though.
Can I call you back?

53
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:20,070
Of course.

54
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:24,070
Doesn't mean I'm not terribly concerned
that your wife just died.

55
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:26,320
Understood.

56
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:28,790
Er, bugger off, call me later.

57
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,210
So what's this big news?

58
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,960
We've been given our parts
in the nativity play

59
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,840
and I'm the lobster.

60
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,590
- The lobster?
- Yeah.

61
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:44,510
- In the nativity play?
- Yeah. First Lobster.

62
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:47,890
There was more than one lobster present
at the birth of Jesus?

63
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:49,970
Duh.

64
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,810
Best sandwiches in Britain.

65
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:00,320
Try my lovely nuts?

66
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:05,410
Beautiful muffin for a beautiful lady.

67
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,870
Morning, my future wife.

68
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:31,430
OK, you can stop there. Thanks.

69
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:33,850
I need a couple of orange gels.

70
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:37,400
By the way, he introduced me as John
but everyone calls me Jack.

71
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,520
Oh, fine. Nice to meet you, Jack.

72
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:42,730
He got me right, though. I'm just Judy.

73
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:45,320
Great, Just Judy!

74
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:53,120
- No surprises?
- No surprises.

75
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:56,710
- Not like the stag night?
- Unlike the stag night.

76
00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:00,420
- You admit the prostitutes were a mistake?
- I do.

77
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:04,010
And it would've been much better
if they'd not turned out to be men?

78
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:06,130
That is true.

79
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:10,640
Good luck, kiddo.

80
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:36,620
Prime Minister, over here!

81
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:50,050
Thank you.

82
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:55,970
- Welcome, Prime Minister.
- Woh! I must work on my wave.

83
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:58,020
How are you?

84
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:00,270
- How are you feeling?
- Erm...

85
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:02,560
Cool. Powerful.

86
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:05,280
Would you like to meet
your household staff?

87
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:08,030
Yes, I would like that very much indeed.

88
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:11,570
Anything to put off
actually running the country.

89
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:15,830
- This is Terence. He's in charge.
- Morning, sir.

90
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:18,540
Good morning.
I had an uncle called Terence.

91
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:22,920
Hated him, I think he was a pervert.
But I very much like the look of you.

92
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,090
- This is Pat.
- Hello, Pat.

93
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:27,670
Good morning, sir. I'm the housekeeper.

94
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:30,340
Oh, right. I should be easier than the last lot.

95
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:33,260
No nappies, no teenagers, no scary wife.

96
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:36,180
And this is Natalie. She's new, like you.

97
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:39,980
- Hello, Natalie.
- Hello, David. I mean, sir.

98
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,350
Shit, I can't believe I've just said that.

99
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:46,150
And now I've gone and said "shit".
Twice. I'm so sorry, sir.

100
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:49,610
You could've said "fuck"
and we'd have been in real trouble.

101
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:53,490
Thank you, sir. I had a premonition
I was gonna fuck up on my first day.

102
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:58,160
Oh, piss it!

103
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:03,000
Right, I'll get my things
and then let's fix the country, shall we?

104
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,960
Yeah, I can't see why not.

105
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:20,600
- It's all right.
- Did you see what I did?

106
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,730
- Yes, I did.
- I just went "blurh".

107
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:25,110
- Hello there.
- I'm right over here.

108
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:28,530
Yeah, I'm in here. OK. Good. Thank you.

109
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:30,530
Ah.

110
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,990
Oh, no.

111
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:39,290
That is so inconvenient.

112
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,120
In the presence of God,
Peter and Juliet have given their consent

113
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:48,840
and made their marriage vows
to each other.

114
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,010
They've declared their marriage
by the giving of rings.

115
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:56,140
I therefore proclaim
that they are husband and wife.

116
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:04,940
And you resisted
the temptation for surprises.

117
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:07,150
Yeah, I'm mature now.

118
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:19,870
Love, love, love

119
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:24,910
Love, love, love

120
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:28,420
- Love, love, love...
- Did you do this?

121
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:31,500
Er, no.

122
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:35,800
Love, love, love, love

123
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:40,810
There's nothing you can do
that can't be done

124
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:42,930
Oh, it...

125
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:45,770
There's nothing you can sing
that can't be sung

126
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:50,900
There's nothing you can say
but you can learn how to play the game

127
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:54,440
It's easy

128
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:58,160
All you need is love

129
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:03,040
All you need is love

130
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:09,710
All you need is love, love

131
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:13,090
Love is all you need...

132
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:17,720
Look, it's Pikey.

133
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:31,560
Hello! What the hell are you doing here?

134
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:34,530
Oh, I just popped over
to borrow some old CDs.

135
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:37,530
- The lady of the house let you in, did she?
- Yeah.

136
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:40,990
- Lovely, obliging girl.
- Yeah.

137
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:44,370
I thought I'd pop back and see
if she's better. This is good.

138
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:48,790
- Oh.
- Listen, erm, I've been thinking.

139
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:53,290
I think we ought to take Mum out for
her birthday on Friday. What do you think?

140
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:58,010
- I just feel we've been bad sons this year.
- Sounds fine. A bit boring but fine.

141
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:00,050
Hurry up, big boy!

142
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:04,220
I'm naked and I want you at least twice
before Jamie gets home.

143
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:16,900
I am so happy to see you!

144
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:21,110
- Delicious delicacy?
- Er, no, thanks.

145
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,910
Taste explosion?

146
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:43,090
- Food?
- No, thanks.

147
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:45,220
Yeah, a bit dodgy, isn't it?

148
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:48,930
Looks like a dead baby's finger. Oooh.

149
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:51,440
Oh. Tastes like it, too.

150
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:57,230
I'm Colin, by the way.

151
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,820
- I'm Nancy.
- Wicked.

152
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:02,320
- What do you do, Nancy?
- I'm a cook.

153
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,320
- Ever do weddings?
- Yes, I do.

154
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:08,240
- They should've asked you to do this one.
- They did.

155
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:11,830
- God, I wish you hadn't have turned it down.
- I didn't.

156
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:14,130
Right.

157
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:20,090
- I've worked out why I can't find true love.
- Why is that?

158
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:22,680
English girls. They're stuck up, you see.

159
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:27,510
And I am primarily attractive to girls
who are cooler, game for a laugh.

160
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:31,850
Like American girls.
So I should just go to America!

161
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:35,020
I'd get a girlfriend there instantly.
What do you think?

162
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:37,360
I think it's crap, Colin.

163
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,230
That's where you're wrong.

164
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:42,320
American girls would dig me
with my cute British accent.

165
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:46,530
- You don't have a cute British accent.
- Yes, I do! I'm going to America.

166
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:50,080
Colin, you're a Ionely, ugly arsehole.
Accept it.

167
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:55,130
Never. I am Colin, God of Sex.
I'm just on the wrong continent, that's all.

168
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:58,000
Bit of quiet
while we finish the lighting, guys!

169
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:02,760
- The traffic today was just...
- Unbelievable.

170
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,260
Judy, could you take the top off this time?

171
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:09,560
Lighting need to know when we're gonna
see the, erm, nipples and when we're not.

172
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,230
Yes, OK. Right.
At least it's nice and warm in here.

173
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:14,730
Not always the case, is it?

174
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:18,570
I was standing in for Brad Pitt once
on Seven Years In Tibet...

175
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:20,860
- Yes, yeah.
- Bloody freezing...

176
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:23,950
Guys, time's tight
and we have to get the actors in.

177
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:26,160
- Fine.
- I promise I won't look.

178
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:33,080
Right, let's have
another look at that, please.

179
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:46,510
Can you just put your hands on her breasts?

180
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:48,890
- OK, yeah. Is that all right?
- Yes.

181
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:50,720
I'll warm them up!

182
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:56,440
- And massage them, please.
- Right.

183
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:06,950
It's junction 13 that's just murder, isn't it?
Total gridlock this morning.

184
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:15,910
Jo and I had a lot of time
to prepare for this moment.

185
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:18,380
Some of her requests,

186
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:24,170
for instance, that I should bring
Claudia Schiffer as my date to the funeral,

187
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:28,090
I was confident she expected me to ignore.

188
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:31,300
But others she was pretty damn clear about.

189
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:35,890
When she first mentioned
what's about to happen,

190
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:39,600
I said, "Over my dead body."

191
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:42,820
And she said, "No, Daniel, over mine."

192
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:46,030
And as usual, my darling girl...

193
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:50,070
and Sam's darling mum was right.

194
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:56,410
So she's going to say her final farewell
to you not through me but,

195
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:58,540
inevitably,

196
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:01,880
ever so coolly,

197
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:06,550
through the immortal genius
of the Bay City Rollers.

198
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:10,930
Bye bye baby, baby goodbye

199
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:15,270
Goodbye baby, baby bye bye

200
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:17,180
Bye bye baby

201
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:22,360
Don't make me cry
Goodbye baby, baby bye bye

202
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:26,360
You're the one girl in town I'd marry

203
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:31,780
Girl I'd marry you now if I were free

204
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:36,950
I wish it could be

205
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,960
I could love you but why begin it?

206
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,090
Cos there ain't any future in it

207
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:47,710
She's got me but I'm not free so...

208
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,510
Bye bye baby, baby goodbye

209
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:56,260
Goodbye baby, baby bye bye

210
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:59,180
Bye bye baby, don't make me cry

211
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:03,270
Goodbye baby, baby bye bye

212
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:05,110
Wish I never had known you...

213
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:07,730
Do you love him?

214
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:09,860
Er, er, what?

215
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:13,700
No, l-I just thought I'd ask bluntly
in case it was the right question

216
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:18,660
and you needed someone to talk to about it
and no one had ever asked you.

217
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:23,500
No. No. No is the answer. Absolutely not.

218
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:25,590
...on my finger...

219
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:27,500
So that's a no, then?

220
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:29,760
Yes. Erm...

221
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,300
Bye bye baby, baby goodbye

222
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:34,430
Goodbye baby, baby bye bye...

223
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:37,390
This DJ, what do you reckon?

224
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:40,350
- The worst in history?
- Probably.

225
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:42,850
I think it all hangs on the next song.

226
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:44,980
Now here's one for the lovers.

227
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:49,070
That's quite a few of you,
I shouldn't be surprised and a half.

228
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:55,120
And they called it...

229
00:17:55,200 --> 00:18:00,330
- He's done it, it's official.
- Worst DJ in the world.

230
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:04,540
Oh, I guess they'll never know...

231
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,750
Sarah's waiting for you.

232
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,430
Oh, yes, of course, erm...

233
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:16,390
Great, er, good, good.

234
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:20,720
How are you doing, Mia?
Settling in fine? Learning who to avoid?

235
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,480
Absolutely.

236
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:26,600
- Harry?
- Sarah,

237
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:33,820
switch off your phone and tell me exactly
how long it is that you've been working here.

238
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:39,490
Two years, seven months,

239
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:42,250
three days and, I suppose, what, two hours?

240
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:47,330
And how long have you been in love
with Karl, our enigmatic chief designer?

241
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:50,460
Um...

242
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:58,390
Two years, seven months, three days
and, I suppose, an hour and 30 minutes.

243
00:18:58,430 --> 00:19:00,140
Thought as much.

244
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:02,220
- Do you think everybody knows?
- Yes.

245
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:04,600
- Do you think Karl knows?
- Yes.

246
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:08,690
Oh, that is... that is bad news.

247
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:14,190
I just thought that maybe the time
had come to do something about it.

248
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,740
- Like what?
- Invite him out for a drink

249
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:22,700
then casually mention you'd like to marry
him and have lots of sex and babies.

250
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:25,080
- You know that?
- Yes.

251
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:28,580
And so does Karl.

252
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:31,130
Think about it, for all our sakes.

253
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,710
It's Christmas.

254
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:38,720
Certainly. Excellent. Will do.

255
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,010
Thanks, boss.

256
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,850
- Hi, Sarah.
- Hi, Karl.

257
00:19:55,490 --> 00:19:58,740
Babe. Absolutely, fire away.

258
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:02,080
Mia, Mia, would you turn that down?

259
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,910
What is that?

260
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:09,580
That was the Christmas effort
from the once great Billy Mack.

261
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:12,590
Oh, dear me, how are the mighty fallen.

262
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:18,300
I can safely say that is the worst record
I've heard this century...

263
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:22,510
Oh, and coincidentally,
I believe Billy will be a guest

264
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:25,310
on my friend Mike's show
in a few minutes' time.

265
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:28,560
Welcome back, Bill.

266
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,690
Billy, welcome back to the airwaves.

267
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:33,900
New Christmas single,
cover of Love Is All Around.

268
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:39,320
Except we've changed
the word "love" to "Christmas".

269
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,570
Yes, is that an important message
to you, Bill?

270
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:45,080
Not really, Mike.

271
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:49,500
Christmas is a time for people
with someone they love in their lives.

272
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:52,040
- And that's not you?
- That's not me, Michael.

273
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:56,090
When I was young and successful,
I was greedy and foolish

274
00:20:56,130 --> 00:21:00,300
and now I'm left with no one,
wrinkled and alone.

275
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:03,090
- Wow. Thanks for that, Bill.
- For what?

276
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:06,010
For actually giving
a real answer to a question.

277
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:09,810
It doesn't often happen here
at Radio Watford, I can tell you.

278
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:13,610
- Ask me anything, I'll tell you the truth.
- Best shag you ever had?

279
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:16,440
- Britney Spears.
- Wow.

280
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,820
No, only kidding!

281
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:21,240
- She was rubbish.
- OK, here's one.

282
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:25,950
How do you think the new record
compares to your old, classic stuff?

283
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:29,500
Come on, Mikey, you know as well as I do
the record's crap.

284
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:34,750
But wouldn't it be great
if number one this Christmas

285
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:37,130
wasn't some smug teenager

286
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:41,510
but an old ex-heroin addict
searching for a comeback at any price?

287
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:45,100
Those young popsters come Christmas
will be stretched out naked

288
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:47,850
with a cute bird balancing on their balls

289
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:51,520
and I'll be stuck in some dingy flat
with me manager Joe,

290
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,690
ugliest man in the world,

291
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:58,190
fucking miserable because
our fucking gamble didn't pay off.

292
00:21:58,230 --> 00:22:03,530
So if you believe in Father Christmas,
children, like your Uncle Billy does,

293
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:07,370
buy my festering turd of a record.

294
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:10,450
And particularly enjoy
the incredible crassness

295
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:14,960
of the moment we try to squeeze
an extra syllable into the fourth line.

296
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,290
I think you're referring to

297
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:19,670
"If you really love Christmas..."

298
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:23,010
"Come on and let it snow." Ouch.

299
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:25,090
So, here it is one more time,

300
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:28,470
the dark horse for this year's
Christmas number one,

301
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:33,020
Christmas Is All Around.
Thank you, Billy. After this, the news.

302
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:35,600
Is the new prime minister in trouble already?

303
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:40,780
I feel it in my fingers
I feel it in my toes

304
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:44,450
- OK. What's next?
- The President's visit.

305
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:48,580
Ah, yes, yes. I fear this is going to be
a difficult one to play. Alex.

306
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:54,000
There's a strong feeling in the party
we mustn't allow ourselves to be bullied

307
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,580
- like the last government.
-  Here, here.

308
00:22:56,670 --> 00:23:00,750
This is our first really important test,
let's take a stand.

309
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:05,510
Right. Right. I understand that
but I have decided...

310
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:09,140
not to. Not this time.

311
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:13,730
Let's not forget that America
is the most powerful country in the world.

312
00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:16,310
I'm not going to act like a petulant child.

313
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:22,150
Who do you have to screw round here
to get a cup of tea and a biscuit?

314
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,910
Right.

315
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:34,910
Yeah, come in.

316
00:23:39,130 --> 00:23:41,800
- These are from the Treasury...
- Uh-huh.

317
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,960
...and these are for you.

318
00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:46,800
Excellent. Thanks a lot.

319
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:51,050
I was hoping you'd win, not that
I wouldn't have been nice to the other bloke,

320
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:55,020
just always given him the boring biscuits
with no chocolate.

321
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:56,980
Thanks very much. Thanks...

322
00:23:58,650 --> 00:24:00,770
Natalie.

323
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:10,070
God, come on, get a grip.
You're the Prime Minister, for God's sake.

324
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:14,660
So what do you reckon
to our new prime minister?

325
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:19,290
Oh, I like him. I can't understand
why he's not married, though.

326
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:22,500
You know the type, he's married to his job.

327
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:25,800
Either that or gay as a picnic basket.

328
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:29,090
Excuse me, Judy, if you could
just lower the nipples

329
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:31,680
- and cheat them a bit to the left?
- OK.

330
00:24:34,930 --> 00:24:37,560
I have to say, Judy, this is a real pleasure,

331
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:41,270
it's lovely to find someone
I can actually chat to.

332
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:43,440
- Thank you!
- Oh, well, you know.

333
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,230
- And ditto.
- Thank you.

334
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:47,650
The move again, please, Judy.

335
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:50,240
- Ooh, sorry.
- Oh, God, sorry. You all right?

336
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:56,410
- Exciting news!
- What?

337
00:24:56,450 --> 00:24:59,830
I've bought a ticket to the States.
I'm off in three weeks.

338
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:01,290
- No.
- Yes!

339
00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:05,500
- To a fantastic place called Wisconsin.
- No!

340
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:09,220
Yes! Wisconsin babes,
here comes Sir Colin!

341
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:13,470
No, Col! There are a few babes in America,
I grant you,

342
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:16,310
but they're going out
with rich, attractive guys.

343
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:19,600
Tone, you're just jealous.

344
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:23,560
You know perfectly well
that any bar anywhere in America

345
00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:28,030
contains ten girls more beautiful
and more likely to have sex with me

346
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:32,740
- than the whole of the United Kingdom.
- That is total bollocks. You're mad.

347
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:37,740
No, I'm wise. Stateside I am Prince William
without the weird family.

348
00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:40,080
- No, Colin, no!
- Yes!

349
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,330
- Nyet!
- Da!

350
00:25:41,370 --> 00:25:42,750
- Nein!
- Ja, darling!

351
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:46,590
Right, the Christmas party,
not my favourite night of the year

352
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:48,960
and your unhappy job to organise.

353
00:25:49,010 --> 00:25:52,010
- Tell me.
- It's basic, really.

354
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:55,890
Find a venue, over-order on the drinks,
bulk buy the guacamole

355
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:59,970
and advise the girls to avoid Kevin
if they want their breasts unfondled.

356
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:04,520
- Wives and family and stuff?
- Yeah. I mean, not children.

357
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:08,190
But their wives and girlfriends, et cetera.

358
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:13,990
Oh, Christ, you haven't got some horrible
six-foot, tight-T-shirt-wearing boyfriend?

359
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:18,830
No. I'll just be hanging around the mistletoe,
hoping to be kissed.

360
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,910
Really?

361
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,040
Right.

362
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:38,260
He now spends all the time in his room.
I mean, he'll be up there now.

363
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:42,020
- That's not unusual. My horrid son...
- Bernard?

364
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:46,650
Bernard. Stays in his room all the time.
Thank goodness.

365
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:49,480
Yeah, but Karen, this is all the time.

366
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:55,110
I'm afraid that there's something
really wrong, you know?

367
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:57,240
I mean, clearly it's about his mum

368
00:26:57,280 --> 00:27:02,450
but Christ, he might be injecting heroin
into his eyeballs for all I know.

369
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:04,290
At the age of 11?

370
00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:08,590
Well, maybe not his eyeballs, then.
Maybe just his veins.

371
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:13,010
The problem is his mum
always used to talk to him, you know, and...

372
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:20,060
I don't know, this whole stepfather thing
seems suddenly to somehow matter

373
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:22,390
like it never did before.

374
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:27,270
Listen, it was always going to be
a totally shit time.

375
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:29,900
Just be patient.

376
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:32,320
And maybe check the room for needles.

377
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:37,360
And then when he sometimes does
come out, it's obvious he's been crying.

378
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:50,090
It's just such a ridiculous waste.

379
00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:53,380
And now if it's going to ruin
Sam's life as well...

380
00:27:54,670 --> 00:27:57,550
I just don't know.

381
00:27:57,590 --> 00:28:00,300
Get a grip.

382
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:02,560
People hate sissies.

383
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:05,890
No one's ever gonna shag you
if you cry all the time.

384
00:28:05,930 --> 00:28:08,900
Yeah. Absolutely.

385
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:11,020
Helpful.

386
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:22,580
So, what's the problem, Samuel?

387
00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:29,290
Is it just Mum or is it something else, huh?

388
00:28:30,670 --> 00:28:32,840
Maybe school?

389
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,960
Are you being bullied?

390
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:39,260
Or is it something worse?

391
00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:43,390
Can you give me any clues at all?

392
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:48,180
- You really want to know?
- I really want to know.

393
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:50,770
Even though you won't be able to help?

394
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:53,480
Even if that's the case, yeah.

395
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,940
OK. Well...

396
00:28:59,150 --> 00:29:01,910
truth is, actually...

397
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:04,870
I'm in love.

398
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:06,540
Sorry?

399
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:11,170
I know I should be thinking
about Mum and I am but I'm in love.

400
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:15,500
I was before she died
and there's nothing I can do about it.

401
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:19,630
- Aren't you a bit young to be in love?
- No.

402
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:22,720
Ah, well. OK, well...

403
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:27,100
I'm a little relieved.

404
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:30,350
- Why?
- Because I...

405
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:32,520
thought it'd be something worse.

406
00:29:32,650 --> 00:29:35,610
Worse than the total agony of being in love?

407
00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:38,360
Er...

408
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:41,110
No, you're right.

409
00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:43,320
Total agony.

410
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,570
- Night, Sarah.
- Night, Karl.

411
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:34,540
Yeah, absolutely.

412
00:30:35,630 --> 00:30:37,880
Free as a bird. Fire away.

413
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:11,540
Alone again.

414
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:14,540
Naturally.

415
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:16,710
- I'll deal with it.
- Mm.

416
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:21,380
- Ah. Natalie.
- Sir.

417
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:24,970
Thanks.

418
00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:27,090
Natalie.

419
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:32,140
Erm, I'm starting to feel...

420
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:37,060
uncomfortable about us
working so closely every day

421
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:41,690
and me knowing so little about you,
it seems elitist and wrong.

422
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:44,610
Well, there's not much to know.

423
00:31:44,650 --> 00:31:48,200
Well, erm, where do you live, for instance?

424
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,450
Wandsworth. The dodgy end.

425
00:31:50,490 --> 00:31:53,870
- Ah, my sister lives in Wandsworth.
- Oh.

426
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,710
So which exactly is the dodgy end?

427
00:31:57,750 --> 00:32:01,380
At the end of the high street,
Harris Street, near the Queen's Head.

428
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:04,300
- Oh, yeah, yeah, that is dodgy.
- Hm.

429
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:08,640
Erm, and you live
with your husband? Boyfriend?

430
00:32:09,890 --> 00:32:12,890
- Three illegitimate but charming children?
- No.

431
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:17,600
I've just split up with my boyfriend, so
I'm back with my mum and dad for a while.

432
00:32:17,690 --> 00:32:21,980
- Ah. Sorry.
- No, it's fine.

433
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:24,480
I'm well shot of him.

434
00:32:24,530 --> 00:32:27,360
- He said I was getting fat.
- I beg your pardon?

435
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:31,370
He said no one'd fancy a girl
with thighs the size of tree trunks.

436
00:32:31,410 --> 00:32:34,040
Not a nice guy, actually, in the end.

437
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:37,460
No.

438
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:46,670
You know, erm...

439
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:50,640
being Prime Minister,
I could just have him murdered.

440
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:54,180
Thank you, sir. I'll think about it.

441
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:58,180
Do. The SAS are absolutely charming.

442
00:32:58,270 --> 00:33:02,270
Ruthless, trained killers
are just a phone call away.

443
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:10,030
Oh, God.

444
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:15,040
Did you have this kind of problem?

445
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:20,080
Yeah, course you did, you saucy minx.

446
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:23,590
So, let's go. We can definitely crack this.

447
00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:25,880
Remember, I was a kid once, too.

448
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:30,340
So, come on, it's someone at school. Right?

449
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:32,300
- Yeah.
- Uh-huh. Good, good.

450
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:35,470
And what does she, he, feel about you?

451
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:38,480
SHE doesn't even know my name.

452
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:41,350
And even if she did, she'd despise me.

453
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:43,770
She's the coolest girl in school.

454
00:33:43,810 --> 00:33:47,940
And everyone worships her
because she's heaven.

455
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:50,530
Good. Good.

456
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:53,950
Well,

457
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:56,700
basically you're fucked, aren't you?

458
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:05,380
Hi there and welcome back.

459
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:09,800
So, three weeks till Christmas, looks like
the real competition is gonna be Blue.

460
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:14,390
I saw them on the show last week.
They weren't very nice about my record.

461
00:34:14,430 --> 00:34:16,850
No. Little scamps.

462
00:34:16,890 --> 00:34:20,350
But very, very talented musicians.

463
00:34:20,390 --> 00:34:24,690
Yeah. I understand you've got a prize
for our competition winners.

464
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:26,230
Yes, I have, Ant or Dec.

465
00:34:26,270 --> 00:34:30,320
It's a personalised felt-tip pen.

466
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,030
Oh, great.

467
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:35,870
It's brilliant. It even writes on glass,

468
00:34:35,910 --> 00:34:40,700
so if you've got a framed picture,
like, for instance, this one of Blue,

469
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:42,830
you can just write on it.

470
00:34:56,590 --> 00:35:00,470
- Er, a lot of kids watching, Billy.
-  Oh, yeah.

471
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:03,390
Hiya, kids.

472
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:06,860
Here's an important message
from your Uncle Bill -

473
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:09,070
don't buy drugs.

474
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:14,110
Become a pop star
and they give you them for free.

475
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:18,990
And I do believe it's a commercial break.
We'll see you soon. Bye-bye.

476
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:23,830
All I want for Christmas is you

477
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:35,260
- Look at him! Eurh!
- Just a minute.

478
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,890
Actually, they're not funny. They're art.

479
00:35:42,430 --> 00:35:45,140
OK, let's say, er, Thursday, my place.

480
00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:49,560
Great. I've got Juliet on the other line,
she wants to ask you a favour.

481
00:35:49,610 --> 00:35:54,610
- OK, fine.
- Thanks and, er, be nice.

482
00:35:54,650 --> 00:35:59,780
- I'm always nice.
- 'You know what I mean, Marky, be friendly.'

483
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:02,200
- I'm always...
-  'Mark? '

484
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:05,210
Hi. How was the honeymoon?

485
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:08,040
It was great.
Thanks for the gorgeous sendoff.

486
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:11,670
- So, what can I do for you?
- 'It's only a tiny favour.'

487
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:14,760
I've just tried the wedding video
and it's a disaster.

488
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:17,930
- 'It's come out all blue and wibbly.'
- I'm sorry.

489
00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:21,640
I remember you filming a lot
and I wondered if I could look at it.

490
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,810
To be honest, I didn't really...

491
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:28,560
Please. All I want is one shot of me
in a wedding dress that isn't turquoise.

492
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:33,570
I'll have a look but I'm pretty sure I wiped it,
so don't get any hopes up.

493
00:36:33,610 --> 00:36:36,490
'Must go.'

494
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:43,950
Any progress with our matchmaking plans?

495
00:36:43,990 --> 00:36:47,960
No. I've done fuck-all and never will
because he's too good for me.

496
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,080
How true.

497
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:53,590
Stop.

498
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:55,880
And of course, your mobile goes.

499
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:59,550
Hello. Hi. How you doing?

500
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:03,560
- So, how's the Christmas party going?
- Good.

501
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,810
Think I've found a venue.

502
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:09,270
- What's it like?
- Good. Good.

503
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:14,440
It's an art gallery. Full of dark corners
for doing dark deeds.

504
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:19,650
Oh. Right.

505
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:23,910
Good. Well, I suppose I should
take a look at it or something.

506
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:26,120
You should.

507
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:46,720
Ah, bonjour, Eleonore.

508
00:37:46,770 --> 00:37:49,640
Bonjour, Monsieur Bennett. Welcome back.

509
00:37:49,730 --> 00:37:51,810
And this year you bring a lady guest?

510
00:37:51,850 --> 00:37:55,110
No. There's a change of situation. Just me.

511
00:37:55,150 --> 00:37:59,610
- Oh. Am I sad or not sad?
- I think you're not surprised.

512
00:37:59,650 --> 00:38:02,410
- And you stay here till Christmas?
- Yeah, yeah.

513
00:38:02,450 --> 00:38:07,700
Good. Well, I find you
a perfect lady to clean the house.

514
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:10,330
This is Aurelia.

515
00:38:10,370 --> 00:38:12,330
Ah.

516
00:38:12,370 --> 00:38:16,460
- Er, bonjour, Aurelia.
- Bonjour.

517
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:21,680
Er, je suis, er, très heureux
de vous avoir ici.

518
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:26,810
Unfortunately, she cannot speak French,
just like you.

519
00:38:26,850 --> 00:38:28,810
She's Portuguese.

520
00:38:28,850 --> 00:38:31,480
Ah, ah, buongiorno.

521
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,480
Eusebio, er, er...

522
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,940
Er, molto bueno...

523
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:42,240
I think she's ten years too young
to remember a footballer called Eusebio.

524
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:44,700
And "molto bueno" is Spanish.

525
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:46,280
Right.

526
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:49,120
Anyway, it's nice to meet you and...

527
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:51,910
Can you drive her home after her work?

528
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:55,790
Oh, absolutely, yes.
Con-Con grande, er, pl-plesura.

529
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:58,090
Which is what? Turkish?

530
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,850
Bello.

531
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:11,600
Er, bella.

532
00:39:12,770 --> 00:39:15,150
Er, mon-montagno,

533
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:17,270
arvarez...

534
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:22,780
No, right. Silence is golden.

535
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:27,030
As the Tremeloes said.

536
00:39:28,870 --> 00:39:30,580
Clever guys,

537
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:35,920
although I think the original version was
by Frankie Valli And The Four Seasons.

538
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,960
Gr-great band.

539
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,550
Silence Is Golden)

540
00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:43,010
Oh, shut up.

541
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:56,020
Mr President!

542
00:39:57,770 --> 00:40:00,520
- Over here, sir!
- What will you be talking about?

543
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:03,650
Mr President, welcome.

544
00:40:03,690 --> 00:40:05,320
It's a pleasure to meet you.

545
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:08,200
Come through.
I'm sorry your wife couldn't make it.

546
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:11,530
So is she. Although she would have been
kind of Ionely.

547
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:13,660
Yes. Pathetic, isn't it?

548
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:16,210
Just never been able to tie a girl down.

549
00:40:16,290 --> 00:40:18,920
Not sure that politics and dating go together.

550
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:21,960
Really? I've never found that.

551
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,470
Yeah, you're still sickeningly handsome,
whereas I look like my Aunt Mildred.

552
00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:31,220
- Very jealous of your plane, by the way.
- Thank you. We love that thing.

553
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:33,560
Ah, Natalie. Hi.

554
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:36,350
Morning, ma'am. How's your day so far?

555
00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:39,100
Excellent.

556
00:40:41,770 --> 00:40:45,530
My goodness,
that's a pretty little son of a bitch.

557
00:40:45,570 --> 00:40:47,650
Did you see those pipes?

558
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:50,910
Yeah, she's terrific. At her job.

559
00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:55,660
No, absolutely not. We cannot
and will not consult on that either.

560
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:57,620
That is unexpected.

561
00:40:57,660 --> 00:41:00,170
Well, it shouldn't be.

562
00:41:00,210 --> 00:41:03,420
The last administration
made it perfectly clear.

563
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:06,340
We're being consistent with their policies.

564
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:09,260
With all respect, they were bad policies.

565
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:12,550
Thanks, Alex. I don't think
we're making progress here.

566
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:16,520
Let's, erm... move on, shall we?

567
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:22,440
Well, now, that was an interesting day.

568
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:28,070
Sorry if our line was firm but there's
no point in tiptoeing around today,

569
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:30,910
then just disappointing you for four years.

570
00:41:30,950 --> 00:41:33,910
I have plans and I plan to see them through.

571
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:37,040
Absolutely.
There is one final thing to look at.

572
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:40,330
It's very close to my heart.
Just give me a second.

573
00:41:40,370 --> 00:41:43,000
I'll give you anything you ask for.

574
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:46,170
As long as it's not something
I don't wanna give.

575
00:41:50,930 --> 00:41:52,590
Hi.

576
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,720
Pathetic.

577
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:18,910
It's great Scotch.

578
00:42:18,950 --> 00:42:22,920
I'II, erm... I'll be going, then.

579
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:26,710
Er, Natalie,

580
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:31,720
I hope to see much more of you
as our countries work toward a better future.

581
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:34,260
Thank you, sir.

582
00:42:50,530 --> 00:42:52,490
Er, yes, Peter.

583
00:42:52,530 --> 00:42:54,820
Mr President, has it been a good visit?

584
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:58,450
Very satisfactory indeed.

585
00:42:58,490 --> 00:43:01,200
We got what we came for

586
00:43:01,250 --> 00:43:04,750
and our special relationship
is still very special.

587
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:07,340
Prime Minister?

588
00:43:07,420 --> 00:43:11,920
I love that word "relationship".
Covers all manner of sins, doesn't it?

589
00:43:11,970 --> 00:43:15,510
I fear that this has become
a bad relationship.

590
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:20,810
A relationship based on
the President taking what he wants

591
00:43:20,850 --> 00:43:25,900
and casually ignoring all those things
that really matter to, erm...

592
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:30,570
Britain.

593
00:43:30,690 --> 00:43:34,820
We may be a small country
but we're a great one, too.

594
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:38,120
The country of Shakespeare,
Churchill, the Beatles,

595
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:41,410
Sean Connery, Harry Potter.

596
00:43:41,450 --> 00:43:44,460
David Beckham's right foot.

597
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:47,210
David Beckham's left foot, come to that.

598
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:51,300
And a friend who bullies us
is no longer a friend.

599
00:43:51,340 --> 00:43:54,590
And since bullies only respond to strength,
from now onward,

600
00:43:54,630 --> 00:43:58,390
I will be prepared to be much stronger.

601
00:43:58,430 --> 00:44:01,720
And the President
should be prepared for that.

602
00:44:11,570 --> 00:44:13,650
Mr President!

603
00:44:17,740 --> 00:44:19,030
Joe.

604
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:22,330
It's your sister on line four.

605
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:28,250
All right. Er, yes, I'm very busy
and important, how can I help you?

606
00:44:28,290 --> 00:44:30,460
Have you gone completely insane?

607
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:34,260
- You can't always be sensible.
- 'You can if you're Prime Minister.'

608
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:37,090
- It's the Chancellor on the other line.
- It isn't!

609
00:44:37,130 --> 00:44:39,930
- 'I'll call you back.'
- No, you won't!

610
00:44:41,810 --> 00:44:47,730
The trouble with being the Prime Minister's
sister is it puts your life into perspective.

611
00:44:47,770 --> 00:44:50,900
What did my brother do today?
He fought for his country.

612
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:55,530
What did I do?
I made a papier-mâché lobster head.

613
00:44:55,570 --> 00:44:58,110
What is this we're listening to?

614
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:00,490
Joni Mitchell.

615
00:45:00,530 --> 00:45:03,410
I can't believe you still listen to Joni Mitchell.

616
00:45:03,490 --> 00:45:07,040
I love her and true love lasts a lifetime.

617
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:13,550
Joni Mitchell is the woman who taught
your cold English wife how to feel.

618
00:45:13,630 --> 00:45:17,800
Did she? Oh, well, that's good,
I must write to her and say thanks.

619
00:45:19,180 --> 00:45:21,470
Which doll for Daisy's friend Emily?

620
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:25,770
The one that looks like a transvestite
or the one that looks like a dominatrix?

621
00:45:26,980 --> 00:45:30,440
'It's almost enough
to make you feel patriotic,

622
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:34,150
'so here's one
for our arse-kicking prime minister.

623
00:45:34,190 --> 00:45:36,940
'A golden oldie for a golden oldie.'

624
00:45:36,990 --> 00:45:39,360
Hold me

625
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:42,160
I'll give you all that you need

626
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:46,330
Wrap your love around me

627
00:45:46,370 --> 00:45:50,040
You're so excited
I can feel you getting hotter

628
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:51,830
Oh baby

629
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:56,500
I'll take you down, I'll take you down

630
00:45:56,550 --> 00:45:58,920
Where no one's ever gone before

631
00:45:58,970 --> 00:46:00,840
And if you want more

632
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:05,720
If you want more, more, more

633
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:08,560
Jump for my love

634
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:10,480
Jump in

635
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:12,350
And feel my touch

636
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:16,570
Jump, if you wanna taste
my kisses in the night then

637
00:46:16,650 --> 00:46:19,280
Jump for my love

638
00:46:20,490 --> 00:46:24,950
I'll take you down, I'll take you down

639
00:46:24,990 --> 00:46:26,490
Where no one's ever gone

640
00:46:26,530 --> 00:46:28,450
Yeah, erm,

641
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:33,670
Mary, can we move the Japanese
ambassador to four o'clock tomorrow?

642
00:46:33,710 --> 00:46:37,250
- Certainly, sir.
- Terrific. Thanks so much.

643
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:47,390
Erm. Would you like the last, er...?

644
00:46:47,430 --> 00:46:49,770
Thank you very much but no.

645
00:46:49,810 --> 00:46:51,980
If you saw my sister, you'd understand why.

646
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:54,150
That's all right, more for me.

647
00:46:54,190 --> 00:46:56,440
Just don't go eating it all yourself,

648
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:57,980
you're getting chubbier every day.

649
00:46:58,020 --> 00:47:02,530
I'm very lucky I've got a constitution
where I never put on weight.

650
00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:08,410
Hello.

651
00:47:15,210 --> 00:47:17,670
Oop. Sorry.

652
00:47:21,170 --> 00:47:22,840
Hello?

653
00:47:38,730 --> 00:47:41,320
- Thank you.
-  Não!

654
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:44,570
- Eu peço imensa desculpa.
- Oh, no. Hold on.

655
00:47:44,610 --> 00:47:47,160
- God, it's half the book. Oh, no.
- Que desastre.

656
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:50,790
Just leave them, please!
They're not important.

657
00:47:50,830 --> 00:47:53,540
They're not worth it!

658
00:47:53,580 --> 00:47:56,540
Stop! Stop.

659
00:47:56,580 --> 00:47:59,210
Aa-ahh.

660
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:02,590
It's all just rubbish.

661
00:48:04,220 --> 00:48:06,380
Just leave it.

662
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:21,520
Oh, God, she's in.

663
00:48:21,570 --> 00:48:25,400
And now she'll think I'm a total spaz
if I don't go in too.

664
00:48:26,490 --> 00:48:28,870
Fuck - it's cold!

665
00:48:32,410 --> 00:48:34,790
Fuck - it's freezing! Fuck!

666
00:48:34,830 --> 00:48:38,210
This stuff better be good.

667
00:48:38,750 --> 00:48:41,710
It's not worth it,
this isn't bloody Shakespeare.

668
00:48:41,750 --> 00:48:43,630
I don't want to drown

669
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:46,470
saving some shit my grandmother
could have written.

670
00:48:46,510 --> 00:48:47,970
Just stop. Stop.

671
00:48:48,010 --> 00:48:50,760
What kind of idiot
doesn't make copies?

672
00:48:50,850 --> 00:48:52,720
I really must do copies.

673
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:56,310
There'd better not be eels in here.

674
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:59,480
Try not to disturb the eels.

675
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:01,520
Oh, what the hell is that?

676
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:14,080
Thank you. Thank you so much.

677
00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:22,000
I know. I'll name
one of the characters after you.

678
00:49:22,090 --> 00:49:26,590
Maybe you could name
one of the characters after me.

679
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:29,800
Or give me 50% of the profits.

680
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:33,050
Or I could give you 5% of the profits.

681
00:49:36,060 --> 00:49:38,850
What kind of book is it?

682
00:49:47,650 --> 00:49:49,780
- Romance?
- Yes.

683
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:52,820
It's, erm...

684
00:49:52,870 --> 00:49:54,120
Ah, er...

685
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:56,410
Thriller... crime...

686
00:49:56,450 --> 00:50:00,460
- Sim.
-  Crime. Crime, murder.

687
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:02,250
Frightening?

688
00:50:02,290 --> 00:50:05,420
Er, scary? Yes, sometimes scary.

689
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:09,920
And, er, sometimes not.
Mainly scary how bad the writing is.

690
00:50:19,140 --> 00:50:21,600
Mm.

691
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:27,320
I'd better get back to work.

692
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:31,110
- Ah.
-  Later you'll drive me home?

693
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:33,280
Sure.

694
00:50:36,580 --> 00:50:39,580
It's my favourite time of day...

695
00:50:39,620 --> 00:50:41,710
driving you.

696
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:48,550
It's the saddest part
of my day, leaving you.

697
00:50:54,340 --> 00:50:55,890
Sorry.

698
00:51:23,290 --> 00:51:26,790
'And coming up
later this morning, it's this guy... '

699
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:31,210
There's no beginning, there'll be no end

700
00:51:31,340 --> 00:51:35,090
- Cos on Christmas...
- '... the bad grandad of rock'n'roll,

701
00:51:35,140 --> 00:51:37,760
'here at 10:30. Do not switch off.'

702
00:51:43,690 --> 00:51:45,600
Banoffee pie?

703
00:51:45,690 --> 00:51:47,440
No, thanks.

704
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:50,980
Thank God. You would've broken my heart
if you'd said yes.

705
00:51:51,030 --> 00:51:54,530
Right, well, lucky you.

706
00:51:54,570 --> 00:51:58,490
- Can I come in?
- Er, yeah, well, I'm a bit busy...

707
00:51:58,530 --> 00:52:03,460
I was just passing and I thought
we might check that video thing out.

708
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:06,460
I thought I might be able
to swap it for some pie

709
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:08,790
or maybe Munchies?

710
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:13,260
Actually, I was serious - I don't know
where it is. I'll have a look tonight.

711
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:16,260
Mark, can I say something?

712
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:18,390
Yeah.

713
00:52:19,430 --> 00:52:21,970
I know you're Peter's best friend

714
00:52:22,020 --> 00:52:27,150
and I know you've never
particularly warmed to me.

715
00:52:27,230 --> 00:52:30,150
Look, don't, don't argue.

716
00:52:30,190 --> 00:52:32,610
We've never got friendly.

717
00:52:32,650 --> 00:52:35,200
But I wanted to say, I hope that can change.

718
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:39,320
I'm nice. I really am.
Apart from my terrible taste in pie and...

719
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:43,290
It would be great if we could be friends.

720
00:52:43,910 --> 00:52:46,000
Absolutely. Absolutely.

721
00:52:49,580 --> 00:52:52,000
Great.

722
00:52:52,050 --> 00:52:55,050
Doesn't mean we'll be able
to find the video, though.

723
00:52:55,090 --> 00:52:58,970
I had a real search when you first called
and couldn't find it so...

724
00:52:59,010 --> 00:53:01,970
This one says
"Peter and Juliet's Wedding".

725
00:53:02,060 --> 00:53:04,350
Do you think we might be on the right track?

726
00:53:04,390 --> 00:53:08,940
Er, yeah, well... Wow. That-that could be it.

727
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:11,770
- Do you mind if I...?
- I've probably taped over it.

728
00:53:11,820 --> 00:53:14,940
Almost everything's episodes of West Wing.

729
00:53:16,030 --> 00:53:18,110
Oh.

730
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:21,830
Oh, bingo.

731
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:25,580
That's lovely.

732
00:53:25,620 --> 00:53:27,790
Well done, you.

733
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:31,330
Oh, that's gorgeous.

734
00:53:32,790 --> 00:53:36,920
Thank you so much, Mark,
this is exactly what I was hoping for.

735
00:53:43,890 --> 00:53:46,180
I look quite pretty.

736
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:55,610
You've stayed rather close.

737
00:54:49,700 --> 00:54:52,000
They're all of me.

738
00:54:56,090 --> 00:54:59,210
Yeah. Yeah.

739
00:54:59,260 --> 00:55:01,340
Yes.

740
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:33,500
But...

741
00:55:34,580 --> 00:55:36,790
you never talk to me.

742
00:55:39,170 --> 00:55:41,260
You always talk to Peter.

743
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:46,010
You don't like me.

744
00:55:47,220 --> 00:55:49,310
I hope it's useful.

745
00:55:49,350 --> 00:55:52,430
Don't show it around too much.

746
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:55,690
Needs a bit of editing.

747
00:55:55,730 --> 00:55:59,440
Look, I've got to get to a... lunch.

748
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:01,440
Early lunch.

749
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:04,450
You can just show yourself out, can't you?

750
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:14,500
It's a... self-preservation thing, you see.

751
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:28,800
Oh I am what I am

752
00:56:28,850 --> 00:56:31,810
I'll do what I want

753
00:56:31,850 --> 00:56:36,650
But I can't hide

754
00:56:36,690 --> 00:56:38,860
And I won't go

755
00:56:39,770 --> 00:56:42,610
I won't sleep

756
00:56:42,650 --> 00:56:45,570
And I can't breathe

757
00:56:45,610 --> 00:56:48,700
Until you're resting here with me

758
00:56:48,740 --> 00:56:51,370
And I won't leave

759
00:56:51,410 --> 00:56:54,200
And I can't hide

760
00:56:54,250 --> 00:56:57,120
I cannot be

761
00:56:57,170 --> 00:56:59,750
Until you're resting here

762
00:56:59,790 --> 00:57:02,670
And I won't go

763
00:57:02,710 --> 00:57:05,550
And I won't sleep

764
00:57:05,590 --> 00:57:08,510
And I can't breathe

765
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:13,060
Until you're resting here with me

766
00:57:13,100 --> 00:57:16,020
Yeah.

767
00:57:18,350 --> 00:57:21,360
Annie, my darling, my dream, my boat.

768
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:24,530
Ah...

769
00:57:24,570 --> 00:57:27,200
- Need you to do a favour for me.
- Of course.

770
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:29,320
Anything for the hero of the hour.

771
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:34,120
Don't ask me why,
and don't read stuff into this,

772
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:36,620
it's just a weird personality thing.

773
00:57:36,660 --> 00:57:39,750
But, erm, you know Natalie who works here?

774
00:57:39,790 --> 00:57:42,340
The chubby girl?

775
00:57:42,380 --> 00:57:44,460
Ooh, would we call her chubby?

776
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:49,180
I think there's a pretty sizeable arse there,
yes, sir. Huge thighs.

777
00:57:50,260 --> 00:57:53,310
Yeah. Well, whatever, erm...

778
00:57:54,430 --> 00:57:58,310
I'm sure she's a lovely girl
but I wonder if you could, erm...

779
00:58:00,900 --> 00:58:03,940
redistribute her?

780
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:06,070
It's done.

781
00:58:41,060 --> 00:58:43,190
Hey, Sammo. Can't sleep?

782
00:58:43,900 --> 00:58:46,020
I got some terrible news today.

783
00:58:46,150 --> 00:58:48,070
Let's have it.

784
00:58:48,190 --> 00:58:51,280
- Joanna's going back to America.
- Your girl's American?

785
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:53,820
Yes, she's American.

786
00:58:53,870 --> 00:58:56,280
And she's not my girl.

787
00:58:56,370 --> 00:59:00,500
And she's going back to America.
That's the end of my life as I know it.

788
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:02,710
That is bad news.

789
00:59:04,790 --> 00:59:07,300
Well, we need Kate

790
00:59:07,340 --> 00:59:10,670
and we need Leo, and we need them now.

791
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:12,510
Come on.

792
00:59:16,220 --> 00:59:18,390
'Hold on. Hold on.

793
00:59:18,430 --> 00:59:20,770
'Keep your eyes closed.

794
00:59:20,810 --> 00:59:25,270
- 'Do you trust me? '
- 'I trust you.'

795
00:59:26,190 --> 00:59:28,860
- Do you trust me?
- I trust you.

796
00:59:28,900 --> 00:59:31,490
- Fool!
- Get off, you big bully.

797
00:59:34,070 --> 00:59:37,160
'AII right, open your eyes.'

798
00:59:40,290 --> 00:59:43,920
You know, Sammy,
I'm sure she's unique and extraordinary

799
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:46,960
but general wisdom is that in the end,

800
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:50,460
there isn't just one person for each of us.

801
00:59:51,550 --> 00:59:53,630
There was for Kate and Leo.

802
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:56,390
There was for you.

803
00:59:56,430 --> 00:59:58,390
And there is for me.

804
00:59:58,430 --> 01:00:00,350
She's the one.

805
01:00:02,020 --> 01:00:04,940
Fair enough. And her name's Joanna?

806
01:00:04,980 --> 01:00:08,190
Yeah, I know. Same as Mum.

807
01:00:18,490 --> 01:00:20,990
Yeah.

808
01:00:24,750 --> 01:00:27,830
- Prime Minister.
- Thank you very much.

809
01:00:43,020 --> 01:00:45,850
Oh. Appolo... Erm, appologia.

810
01:00:45,890 --> 01:00:51,150
Grande, er... grande familio,
grande tradizione de Christmas presents.

811
01:00:51,190 --> 01:00:53,280
Stupido.

812
01:01:19,390 --> 01:01:22,100
Well, goodbye.

813
01:01:22,140 --> 01:01:24,270
Thank you.

814
01:01:27,310 --> 01:01:29,810
Erm, it was, erm...

815
01:01:30,900 --> 01:01:33,940
I will miss you.

816
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:38,200
And your very slow typing...

817
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:42,120
and your very bad driving.

818
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:46,970
You know I love Christmas, I always will

819
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:53,020
My mind's made up, the way that I feel

820
01:02:54,440 --> 01:02:59,030
There's no beginning, there'll be no end

821
01:02:59,070 --> 01:03:04,120
Cos on Christmas you can depend

822
01:03:10,290 --> 01:03:12,370
Daniel!

823
01:03:13,460 --> 01:03:17,550
- I have a plan.
- Thank the Lord. Tell me.

824
01:03:17,590 --> 01:03:20,720
- Well, girls love musicians, don't they?
- Uh-huh.

825
01:03:20,760 --> 01:03:23,720
- Even the weird ones get girlfriends.
- That's right.

826
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:26,220
Meat Loaf definitely got laid at least once.

827
01:03:26,260 --> 01:03:30,100
For God's sake,
Ringo Starr married a Bond girl.

828
01:03:30,180 --> 01:03:34,190
Whatever. There's this big concert
at the end of term and Joanna's in it.

829
01:03:34,270 --> 01:03:38,070
I thought if I was in the band
and played superbly,

830
01:03:38,110 --> 01:03:41,240
she might fall in love with me.
What do you think?

831
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:44,160
I think it's brilliant, I think it's stellar.

832
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:48,120
Apart from the one obvious
tiny little baby little hiccup.

833
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:51,500
- I don't play a musical instrument?
- Yes, sir.

834
01:03:52,290 --> 01:03:54,460
A tiny, insignificant detail.

835
01:03:57,790 --> 01:04:00,130
You look into my eyes

836
01:04:00,170 --> 01:04:02,880
I go out of my mind

837
01:04:02,920 --> 01:04:04,880
I can't see anything

838
01:04:04,970 --> 01:04:07,510
Cos this love's got me blind

839
01:04:07,550 --> 01:04:10,390
I can't help myself

840
01:04:10,430 --> 01:04:12,140
I can't break this spell

841
01:04:12,180 --> 01:04:15,850
I can't even try

842
01:04:17,110 --> 01:04:21,650
Baby, I'm too lost in you

843
01:04:21,690 --> 01:04:23,900
Caught in you

844
01:04:23,950 --> 01:04:27,450
Lost in everything about you

845
01:04:27,490 --> 01:04:32,000
So deep I can't sleep, I can't...

846
01:04:32,040 --> 01:04:34,790
I suppose I'd better do the duty round.

847
01:04:34,830 --> 01:04:36,920
You're a saint.

848
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:46,590
Any chance of a dance with the boss?

849
01:04:47,640 --> 01:04:49,890
Yeah, sure, sure.

850
01:04:49,930 --> 01:04:52,310
As long as your boyfriend doesn't mind.

851
01:04:55,060 --> 01:04:57,100
Not my boyfriend.

852
01:04:57,150 --> 01:04:59,310
And you're all I see

853
01:04:59,360 --> 01:05:01,900
And you're all I need

854
01:05:01,980 --> 01:05:04,110
Help me, baby
Help me, baby

855
01:05:04,150 --> 01:05:05,650
Help me, baby

856
01:05:05,700 --> 01:05:11,080
Oh baby, I'm too lost in you

857
01:05:11,120 --> 01:05:12,330
Caught in you...

858
01:05:12,370 --> 01:05:14,910
You're looking very pretty tonight.

859
01:05:16,750 --> 01:05:18,830
It's for you.

860
01:05:20,290 --> 01:05:22,340
Sorry?

861
01:05:24,760 --> 01:05:26,970
It's all for you, sir.

862
01:05:28,840 --> 01:05:30,720
You do

863
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:33,930
I'm too lost in you
Baby, baby

864
01:05:33,970 --> 01:05:38,190
Baby, I'm too lost in you
Yeah, yeah

865
01:05:38,230 --> 01:05:40,690
Caught in you

866
01:05:40,730 --> 01:05:43,940
Lost in everything about you

867
01:05:43,980 --> 01:05:48,110
So deep I can't sleep

868
01:05:49,240 --> 01:05:53,910
'This must be very exciting for you,
fighting for the Christmas number one.

869
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:57,080
- 'How's it looking so far? '
- 'Very bad indeed.

870
01:05:57,120 --> 01:06:00,330
'Blue are outselling me five to one

871
01:06:00,380 --> 01:06:03,460
'but I'm hoping for a late surge.

872
01:06:03,500 --> 01:06:06,550
'And, if I reach number one,

873
01:06:06,590 --> 01:06:12,550
'I promise to sing a song stark naked
on TV on Christmas Eve.'

874
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:16,390
- 'Do you mean that? '
- 'Of course I do, Michael.

875
01:06:16,430 --> 01:06:19,520
'Do you want a preview? You old flirt.'

876
01:06:23,020 --> 01:06:24,940
'That'll never make number one.'

877
01:06:28,280 --> 01:06:31,740
And I burn every track
Clipse and J Timberlake...

878
01:06:31,780 --> 01:06:35,410
I suppose it's his job
to dance with everyone, isn't it?

879
01:06:35,450 --> 01:06:37,660
Some more than others.

880
01:06:40,870 --> 01:06:43,080
Just one dance?

881
01:06:43,130 --> 01:06:46,630
- Before we run out of chances.
- Who, me?

882
01:06:46,710 --> 01:06:50,930
- Unless you just...
- No! No! Good.

883
01:06:50,970 --> 01:06:53,090
Yes. Thanks.

884
01:06:54,510 --> 01:06:58,640
You're a good girl
And that's what makes me trust you like I do

885
01:06:58,680 --> 01:07:01,350
Late at night I talk to you

886
01:07:01,390 --> 01:07:02,940
Hey

887
01:07:03,020 --> 01:07:05,070
You will know the difference when...

888
01:07:13,450 --> 01:07:17,450
Like a flower

889
01:07:17,490 --> 01:07:21,580
Waiting to bloom

890
01:07:23,710 --> 01:07:26,500
Like a light bulb

891
01:07:27,670 --> 01:07:30,050
In a dark room

892
01:07:32,130 --> 01:07:34,890
I'm just sitting here

893
01:07:34,930 --> 01:07:37,720
Waiting for you

894
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:40,060
To come on home

895
01:07:40,100 --> 01:07:42,190
And turn me on

896
01:07:48,070 --> 01:07:50,990
Like the desert

897
01:07:52,070 --> 01:07:56,870
Waiting for the rain

898
01:07:57,950 --> 01:08:00,540
Like a schoolkid

899
01:08:02,210 --> 01:08:04,960
Waiting for the spring

900
01:08:06,710 --> 01:08:08,550
I'm just sitting here

901
01:08:08,590 --> 01:08:13,630
Waiting for you to come on home

902
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:16,930
And turn me on

903
01:08:16,970 --> 01:08:21,930
Turn me on

904
01:08:21,980 --> 01:08:24,190
Well, then. I'd better go.

905
01:08:24,230 --> 01:08:26,310
OK.

906
01:08:27,690 --> 01:08:29,900
- Good night.
- Good night.

907
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:49,130
Actually...

908
01:08:49,170 --> 01:08:51,500
- I don't have to go.
- Right. Good.

909
01:08:51,550 --> 01:08:53,670
- I mean...
- No, that's good.

910
01:08:54,670 --> 01:08:58,260
Just, erm, would you excuse me
for one second?

911
01:08:58,300 --> 01:09:01,010
- Sure.
- Just one second.

912
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:11,820
Erm, OK, that's done. Erm...

913
01:09:13,440 --> 01:09:16,950
Why don't you come upstairs
in about ten seconds?

914
01:09:16,990 --> 01:09:19,280
- Ten seconds.
- Ten seconds.

915
01:09:44,060 --> 01:09:48,350
For you

916
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:54,400
There'll be no crying

917
01:09:56,610 --> 01:10:02,780
For you

918
01:10:04,410 --> 01:10:09,170
The sun will be shining

919
01:10:09,540 --> 01:10:14,800
Cos I feel that when I'm with you

920
01:10:15,880 --> 01:10:19,720
It's all right...

921
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:22,260
- Just tug it.
- OK.

922
01:10:22,300 --> 01:10:27,680
I know it's right

923
01:10:27,770 --> 01:10:31,310
And the songbirds

924
01:10:31,350 --> 01:10:40,320
Keep singing like they know the score

925
01:10:40,360 --> 01:10:43,660
And I love you, I love you, I love you...

926
01:10:43,700 --> 01:10:46,450
You're beautiful.

927
01:10:46,490 --> 01:10:50,920
Like never before...

928
01:11:09,730 --> 01:11:12,020
l-I'd better answer that.

929
01:11:16,270 --> 01:11:19,490
Hello. Hi. Hello, darling.

930
01:11:19,530 --> 01:11:22,530
No, no, I'm not busy. No, fire away.

931
01:11:23,620 --> 01:11:25,490
Right.

932
01:11:25,530 --> 01:11:29,580
Yes, I... I'm not quite sure
it's gonna be possible

933
01:11:29,620 --> 01:11:32,370
to get the Pope on the phone tonight but...

934
01:11:33,460 --> 01:11:39,090
Yes. Yes, I'm sure he's very good
at exorcism but...

935
01:11:42,510 --> 01:11:44,970
Well, I'm sure...

936
01:11:45,100 --> 01:11:48,890
Jon Bon Jovi is as well
and I'll definitely look into it.

937
01:11:48,930 --> 01:11:52,520
OK? OK, I'll talk to you later.

938
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:54,650
All right, bye-bye.

939
01:12:00,030 --> 01:12:03,950
- Sorry about that.
- No, it's fine.

940
01:12:03,990 --> 01:12:06,990
It's my brother, he's not well, he calls a lot.

941
01:12:08,950 --> 01:12:11,410
- I'm sorry.
- No, it's fine. It's fine.

942
01:12:11,500 --> 01:12:14,870
I mean, it's not really fine, it is what it is,

943
01:12:14,920 --> 01:12:18,590
and there being no parents now
and us being over here,

944
01:12:18,630 --> 01:12:24,050
it's my job to keep an eye on him.
Not my job, obviously, I'm glad to do it...

945
01:12:24,090 --> 01:12:28,930
That's OK. Life is full
of interruptions and complications.

946
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:33,100
So...

947
01:12:50,040 --> 01:12:52,120
Will it make him better?

948
01:12:53,500 --> 01:12:55,290
No.

949
01:12:55,370 --> 01:12:57,420
Then maybe...

950
01:12:58,170 --> 01:13:00,250
don't answer.

951
01:13:07,720 --> 01:13:10,310
Hey. How you doing?

952
01:13:11,010 --> 01:13:14,020
Right, right. Oh, no, please.

953
01:13:14,060 --> 01:13:17,350
Oh, please, please don't, little darling.

954
01:13:17,400 --> 01:13:22,190
Between the two of us we'll find the answer
and it won't hurt any more.

955
01:13:22,230 --> 01:13:24,240
No, no.

956
01:13:24,280 --> 01:13:26,360
I'm-I'm not busy. I...

957
01:13:28,030 --> 01:13:31,330
Of course, if you want me
to come over I will. Mm-hm.

958
01:13:33,080 --> 01:13:34,910
OK.

959
01:13:43,880 --> 01:13:46,760
That was a good night.

960
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:49,510
- Except I felt fat.
- Don't be ridiculous.

961
01:13:49,550 --> 01:13:51,220
It's true.

962
01:13:51,260 --> 01:13:55,520
Nowadays the only clothes I can get into
were once owned by Pavarotti.

963
01:13:55,560 --> 01:13:58,480
I always think Pavarotti dresses very well.

964
01:14:01,980 --> 01:14:04,070
Mia's very pretty.

965
01:14:05,940 --> 01:14:08,030
Is she?

966
01:14:09,410 --> 01:14:12,450
You know she is, darling.

967
01:14:12,490 --> 01:14:14,740
Be careful there.

968
01:14:37,930 --> 01:14:40,730
Have you been watching stuff on TV?

969
01:14:42,060 --> 01:14:44,650
Yeah.

970
01:14:44,690 --> 01:14:46,690
- Every night.
- Good.

971
01:14:46,740 --> 01:14:48,900
And every day.

972
01:14:55,830 --> 01:15:00,790
- The nurses are trying to kill me.
- Nobody's trying to kill you, babe.

973
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:08,970
Thank you.

974
01:15:11,680 --> 01:15:14,180
Don't do that, my darling.

975
01:15:16,470 --> 01:15:18,560
Thank you.

976
01:15:25,610 --> 01:15:27,780
Don't do that.

977
01:16:00,430 --> 01:16:04,940
Right. Back at three. Christmas shopping,
never easy or pleasant.

978
01:16:04,980 --> 01:16:07,900
Are you gonna get me something?

979
01:16:07,940 --> 01:16:10,030
Er...

980
01:16:11,530 --> 01:16:13,610
I don't know, I hadn't thought.

981
01:16:13,660 --> 01:16:15,530
Where's Sarah, by the way?

982
01:16:15,570 --> 01:16:18,370
She couldn't make it in. Family thing.

983
01:16:18,410 --> 01:16:22,160
There's a word for hangover
I've never heard before.

984
01:16:22,210 --> 01:16:26,380
- See you later.
- Yes. Looking forward to it.

985
01:16:29,750 --> 01:16:31,840
A lot.

986
01:16:43,890 --> 01:16:46,100
Are you gonna give me something?

987
01:16:47,110 --> 01:16:49,860
I thought I made it clear last night.

988
01:16:49,900 --> 01:16:53,650
When it comes to me,
you can have everything.

989
01:16:53,740 --> 01:16:57,200
So, erm, what do you need?

990
01:16:58,450 --> 01:17:02,500
Something along the stationery line?
Are you short of staplers?

991
01:17:02,540 --> 01:17:06,000
No. I don't want something I need.

992
01:17:06,040 --> 01:17:09,500
I want something I want. Something pretty.

993
01:17:10,670 --> 01:17:12,590
Right.

994
01:17:13,670 --> 01:17:15,760
Right.

995
01:17:23,140 --> 01:17:26,850
Sorry I'm late, I had to drop off
Bernie at rehearsal.

996
01:17:30,730 --> 01:17:33,440
Right, listen, you keep yourself occupied

997
01:17:33,490 --> 01:17:36,610
while I do the boring stuff for our mothers.

998
01:17:58,550 --> 01:18:00,680
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

999
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:03,520
Looking for anything in particular, sir?

1000
01:18:03,560 --> 01:18:07,230
Yes. That necklace there, how much is it?

1001
01:18:07,270 --> 01:18:09,480
It's £270.

1002
01:18:10,810 --> 01:18:14,940
- Erm, all right. Er, I'll have it.
- Lovely.

1003
01:18:17,950 --> 01:18:21,070
Would you like it... giftwrapped?

1004
01:18:21,120 --> 01:18:23,910
- Yes, all right.
- Lovely.

1005
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,210
Let me just pop it in the box.

1006
01:18:30,920 --> 01:18:32,420
There.

1007
01:18:32,460 --> 01:18:36,050
- Look, could we be quite quick?
- Certainly, sir.

1008
01:18:36,090 --> 01:18:38,970
Ready in the flashiest of flashes.

1009
01:18:46,430 --> 01:18:48,100
- There.
- That's great.

1010
01:18:48,140 --> 01:18:50,980
Not quite finished.

1011
01:18:54,480 --> 01:18:59,200
- I don't need a bag, I'll put it in my pocket.
- Oh, this isn't a bag, sir.

1012
01:18:59,240 --> 01:19:02,660
- Really?
- This is so much more than a bag.

1013
01:19:09,410 --> 01:19:11,460
Ooh!

1014
01:19:25,850 --> 01:19:28,220
Could we be quite quick, please?

1015
01:19:28,310 --> 01:19:31,100
Prontissimo.

1016
01:19:49,370 --> 01:19:52,120
- What's that?
- A cinnamon stick, sir.

1017
01:19:52,170 --> 01:19:55,710
- Actually, I really can't wait.
- You won't regret it, sir.

1018
01:19:55,750 --> 01:19:58,050
Want to bet?

1019
01:19:58,090 --> 01:20:00,550
'Tis but the work of a moment.

1020
01:20:04,050 --> 01:20:06,300
There we go. Almost finished.

1021
01:20:06,350 --> 01:20:10,850
Are you gonna dip it in yogurt?
Cover it with chocolate buttons?

1022
01:20:10,890 --> 01:20:14,020
No, sir, we're going to pop it
in the Christmas box.

1023
01:20:14,060 --> 01:20:15,690
I don't want a Christmas box.

1024
01:20:15,730 --> 01:20:18,530
- But you wanted it giftwrapped.
- I did but...

1025
01:20:18,570 --> 01:20:20,400
- The final flourish.
- Can I pay?

1026
01:20:20,440 --> 01:20:23,150
- All we need now...
- Oh, God.

1027
01:20:23,200 --> 01:20:25,450
...is a sprig of holly.
- No, no, no, no.

1028
01:20:25,490 --> 01:20:27,490
- No bloody holly.
- But sir...

1029
01:20:27,580 --> 01:20:30,250
- Leave it.
- Ooh!

1030
01:20:30,290 --> 01:20:34,290
- Loitering around the jewellery section?
- No. I was just looking around.

1031
01:20:34,330 --> 01:20:37,000
Don't worry. My expectations
are not that high

1032
01:20:37,040 --> 01:20:40,710
after 13 years of
Mr Oh-But-You-Always-Love-Scarves.

1033
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:42,840
Actually, I do love this one.

1034
01:20:45,140 --> 01:20:47,350
I've gotta know

1035
01:20:47,390 --> 01:20:53,560
Where do the Ionely hearts go...

1036
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:56,980
- Hey!
- What are you doing here?

1037
01:20:57,060 --> 01:21:00,070
Had to rent out my flat to pay for my ticket.

1038
01:21:00,150 --> 01:21:03,490
You're not actually going ahead
with this stupid plan?

1039
01:21:03,530 --> 01:21:05,280
I bloody am.

1040
01:21:05,320 --> 01:21:08,660
You think this is full of clothes?
Like hell it is.

1041
01:21:08,700 --> 01:21:11,790
It is chock-a-block full of condoms.

1042
01:21:11,830 --> 01:21:15,250
Excellent. Excellent.
Perfect, keep that going.

1043
01:21:15,370 --> 01:21:17,630
Look, erm...

1044
01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:21,550
sorry to be a bit forward and all that but...

1045
01:21:21,590 --> 01:21:26,260
you don't fancy going for a Christmas drink,
do you? I mean, nothing implied.

1046
01:21:26,300 --> 01:21:31,930
Just maybe go and see something
Christmassy or something.

1047
01:21:31,970 --> 01:21:35,310
Obviously, if you don't want to,
you don't have to. I...

1048
01:21:35,350 --> 01:21:37,100
I'm rambling now, sorry.

1049
01:21:37,150 --> 01:21:39,860
No. That would be lovely.

1050
01:21:39,900 --> 01:21:42,280
Oh, great.

1051
01:21:44,610 --> 01:21:45,950
Yay!

1052
01:21:46,030 --> 01:21:48,160
You know, that is really great.

1053
01:21:48,200 --> 01:21:53,160
Normally, I'm really shy, takes me ages
to get the courage up, so thank you.

1054
01:21:59,710 --> 01:22:05,090
- Explain again why you're so late.
- Can't a man have any secrets?

1055
01:22:05,130 --> 01:22:09,390
We've been waiting for hours,
it's the first ever preview.

1056
01:22:09,430 --> 01:22:11,510
...is a thing of the past

1057
01:22:11,550 --> 01:22:14,980
Maybe you can bring us all hope this year

1058
01:22:15,020 --> 01:22:18,020
Visions of sugarplums
have disappeared...

1059
01:22:18,060 --> 01:22:22,150
It was a starry night
in ancient Jerusalem

1060
01:22:22,190 --> 01:22:25,400
and the baby Jesus was in his manger.

1061
01:22:33,490 --> 01:22:37,210
Sherlock Holmes is not a real detective.

1062
01:22:37,250 --> 01:22:40,290
Is this the way to the train station?

1063
01:22:40,330 --> 01:22:43,500
I would like half-pint of churly.

1064
01:22:44,590 --> 01:22:47,300
I would like a one-day Travelcard.

1065
01:22:47,340 --> 01:22:51,140
Oh, my God,
I've got a terrible stomachache.

1066
01:22:51,180 --> 01:22:53,470
It must have been the prawns.

1067
01:22:53,510 --> 01:22:56,100
Milton Keynes has many roundabouts.

1068
01:22:57,270 --> 01:23:01,440
My goodness,
this is a very big fish!

1069
01:23:01,480 --> 01:23:04,520
It tastes delicious!

1070
01:23:04,570 --> 01:23:06,320
All alone on Christmas

1071
01:23:06,360 --> 01:23:08,990
Nobody ought to be alone on Christmas

1072
01:23:09,030 --> 01:23:12,990
All alone on Christmas
Nobody ought to be alone on Christmas

1073
01:23:13,030 --> 01:23:14,580
Tell me I've got to know

1074
01:23:14,620 --> 01:23:19,330
Nobody ought to be alone on Christmas
Don't leave me alone

1075
01:23:19,370 --> 01:23:24,170
- You'll come back a broken man.
- Yeah, back broken from too much sex.

1076
01:23:24,210 --> 01:23:26,590
You are on the road to disaster.

1077
01:23:26,670 --> 01:23:30,130
No, I am on shag highway, heading west.

1078
01:23:30,760 --> 01:23:32,680
Farewell, failure.

1079
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:36,680
America, watch out!
Here comes Colin Frissell.

1080
01:23:36,770 --> 01:23:40,350
And he's got a big knob

1081
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:44,400
Smooth)

1082
01:23:51,110 --> 01:23:53,660
- Take me to a bar.
- What kind of bar?

1083
01:23:53,700 --> 01:23:57,120
Just any bar.
Just your average American bar.

1084
01:23:57,870 --> 01:24:00,790
Man, it's a hot one

1085
01:24:00,830 --> 01:24:04,170
Like seven inches
from the midday sun...

1086
01:24:04,210 --> 01:24:08,000
- Can I help you?
- Yes. I'd like a Budweiser, please.

1087
01:24:08,050 --> 01:24:11,510
- King of beers.
- Bud coming up.

1088
01:24:12,380 --> 01:24:14,680
Oh, my God.

1089
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:16,640
Are you from England?

1090
01:24:18,260 --> 01:24:20,730
- Yes.
- Oh...

1091
01:24:20,770 --> 01:24:23,810
that is so cute.

1092
01:24:23,850 --> 01:24:27,520
Hi, I'm Stacey.

1093
01:24:27,570 --> 01:24:29,650
Jeannie?

1094
01:24:31,530 --> 01:24:33,660
Yeah?

1095
01:24:33,700 --> 01:24:36,490
- This is...
- Colin.

1096
01:24:38,030 --> 01:24:40,250
Frissell.

1097
01:24:40,290 --> 01:24:42,410
Cute name.

1098
01:24:42,460 --> 01:24:45,290
- Jeannie.
- He's from England.

1099
01:24:45,330 --> 01:24:47,590
Yep. Basildon.

1100
01:24:47,630 --> 01:24:50,550
- Oh.
- Oh.

1101
01:24:50,590 --> 01:24:55,550
Wait till Carol-Anne gets here.
She's crazy about English guys.

1102
01:24:55,590 --> 01:24:57,760
Uh-huh.

1103
01:25:00,810 --> 01:25:04,810
- Hey, girls.
- Carol-Anne, come meet Colin.

1104
01:25:04,850 --> 01:25:07,480
He's from England.

1105
01:25:07,560 --> 01:25:11,780
Well, step aside, ladies. This one's on me.

1106
01:25:14,900 --> 01:25:17,490
Hey, gorgeous.

1107
01:25:19,240 --> 01:25:21,370
That is so funny!

1108
01:25:22,750 --> 01:25:25,080
- What do you call that?
- Er, bottle.

1109
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:27,250
"Bottle."

1110
01:25:27,290 --> 01:25:29,380
- What about this?
- Er, straw.

1111
01:25:29,420 --> 01:25:31,300
"Straw."

1112
01:25:31,340 --> 01:25:33,340
- What about this?
- Table.

1113
01:25:34,590 --> 01:25:36,680
- Table. The same.
- Oh, it's the same.

1114
01:25:36,720 --> 01:25:40,140
- Where are you staying?
- I don't actually know.

1115
01:25:40,220 --> 01:25:43,020
I'll just check into a motel like in the movies.

1116
01:25:43,100 --> 01:25:46,390
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, that is so cute.

1117
01:25:46,440 --> 01:25:51,150
No, no, no, listen. This may be a bit pushy
cos we just met you but...

1118
01:25:51,270 --> 01:25:53,780
why don't you come back
and sleep at our place?

1119
01:25:53,820 --> 01:25:55,990
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1120
01:25:56,030 --> 01:25:59,030
Well, if it's not too much
of an inconvenience.

1121
01:25:59,070 --> 01:26:02,120
- Hell no!
- But there's one problem.

1122
01:26:02,160 --> 01:26:04,290
What?

1123
01:26:04,330 --> 01:26:08,000
Well, we're not the richest of girls,
you know.

1124
01:26:08,040 --> 01:26:13,050
So we just have a little bed and no couch.

1125
01:26:13,090 --> 01:26:16,470
So you'd have to share with all three of us.

1126
01:26:16,510 --> 01:26:22,970
And on this cold, cold night it's gonna be
crowded and sweaty and stuff.

1127
01:26:23,010 --> 01:26:25,810
And we can't even afford pyjamas.

1128
01:26:25,890 --> 01:26:28,270
No?

1129
01:26:28,310 --> 01:26:30,860
Which means...

1130
01:26:30,900 --> 01:26:33,110
we would be naked.

1131
01:26:37,780 --> 01:26:39,450
No, no, I think it'd be fine.

1132
01:26:39,490 --> 01:26:41,910
- Great.
- Erm...

1133
01:26:41,950 --> 01:26:45,080
The thing that's gonna make it
more crowded...

1134
01:26:45,120 --> 01:26:47,330
Harriet. You haven't met Harriet.

1135
01:26:47,410 --> 01:26:49,250
- There's a fourth?
- Yeah.

1136
01:26:49,330 --> 01:26:53,630
Don't worry, you're totally gonna like her
cos she is "the sexy one".

1137
01:26:53,670 --> 01:26:56,460
- Really? Wow.
- Yeah.

1138
01:26:56,550 --> 01:27:00,340
- Praise the Lord!
- Oh, and he's a Christian.

1139
01:27:02,850 --> 01:27:04,470
Cheers.

1140
01:27:04,600 --> 01:27:07,100
If I could

1141
01:27:07,140 --> 01:27:09,310
Then I would

1142
01:27:09,350 --> 01:27:13,570
I'll go wherever you will go

1143
01:27:13,610 --> 01:27:15,650
Way up high

1144
01:27:15,690 --> 01:27:17,740
Or down low

1145
01:27:17,860 --> 01:27:22,030
I'll go wherever you will go

1146
01:27:22,070 --> 01:27:25,490
If I could turn back...

1147
01:27:25,540 --> 01:27:28,790
One present only each tonight.
Who's got one for Dad?

1148
01:27:28,830 --> 01:27:30,830
- I have.
- Let Mummy go first.

1149
01:27:30,870 --> 01:27:34,040
- I'll get it.
- No, no, no. I want to choose mine.

1150
01:27:34,130 --> 01:27:36,380
I think I want...

1151
01:27:38,550 --> 01:27:42,340
...this one.
- I have bought the traditional scarf as well

1152
01:27:42,390 --> 01:27:46,350
but this is my other,
slightly special, personal one.

1153
01:27:46,430 --> 01:27:48,560
Thank you.

1154
01:27:48,600 --> 01:27:50,730
That's a real first.

1155
01:27:50,770 --> 01:27:53,230
- Rip it!
- What is it?

1156
01:27:53,270 --> 01:27:55,860
I'm going to... All right, I'll rip it.

1157
01:28:02,410 --> 01:28:04,820
God, that's a surprise.

1158
01:28:06,080 --> 01:28:07,870
What is it?

1159
01:28:09,790 --> 01:28:13,460
It's a CD. Joni Mitchell, wow.

1160
01:28:13,500 --> 01:28:15,880
To continue your emotional education.

1161
01:28:15,960 --> 01:28:18,130
Yes.

1162
01:28:18,170 --> 01:28:20,670
Goodness.

1163
01:28:20,720 --> 01:28:22,720
That's great.

1164
01:28:22,760 --> 01:28:25,720
- My brilliant wife.
- Ah, yes.

1165
01:28:27,970 --> 01:28:32,310
Actually, do you mind if I just absent myself
for a second?

1166
01:28:32,350 --> 01:28:35,310
All that ice cream. Er...

1167
01:28:35,360 --> 01:28:38,610
Darling, could you make sure
the kids are ready to go?

1168
01:28:38,650 --> 01:28:41,780
- Back in a minute.
-  All right, take it easy.

1169
01:28:42,150 --> 01:28:44,110
Mine first. Mine.

1170
01:28:44,530 --> 01:28:47,330
Moons and Junes

1171
01:28:47,370 --> 01:28:49,790
And Ferris wheels

1172
01:28:51,250 --> 01:28:56,460
The dizzy dancing way that you feel

1173
01:28:56,580 --> 01:29:01,590
As every fairy tale comes real

1174
01:29:04,010 --> 01:29:06,510
I've looked at love that way

1175
01:29:10,140 --> 01:29:13,810
But now it's just another show

1176
01:29:16,060 --> 01:29:20,610
And you leave 'em laughing when you go

1177
01:29:21,990 --> 01:29:24,740
And if you care

1178
01:29:24,780 --> 01:29:26,990
Don't let them know

1179
01:29:28,780 --> 01:29:32,040
Don't give yourself away

1180
01:29:34,830 --> 01:29:37,170
I've looked at love

1181
01:29:37,210 --> 01:29:40,130
From both sides now

1182
01:29:40,170 --> 01:29:42,300
From give and take

1183
01:29:43,550 --> 01:29:46,720
And still somehow

1184
01:29:46,760 --> 01:29:52,020
It's love's illusions that I recall

1185
01:29:53,890 --> 01:29:56,350
I really don't know love

1186
01:30:00,650 --> 01:30:03,400
I really don't know love at all

1187
01:30:15,160 --> 01:30:17,420
Tears and fears

1188
01:30:17,460 --> 01:30:20,290
And feeling proud

1189
01:30:21,380 --> 01:30:26,470
To say I love you right out loud

1190
01:30:27,550 --> 01:30:30,260
Dreams and schemes

1191
01:30:30,350 --> 01:30:33,140
And circus crowds

1192
01:30:34,470 --> 01:30:37,560
I've looked at life that way

1193
01:30:39,020 --> 01:30:41,230
Oh but now old friends...

1194
01:30:41,270 --> 01:30:42,940
Oh, my God.

1195
01:30:42,980 --> 01:30:46,070
It's a miracle. You're all dressed.

1196
01:30:46,110 --> 01:30:49,200
Come on, come on, come on,
we're horribly late.

1197
01:30:49,240 --> 01:30:51,700
Come on, then. In the car. In the car.

1198
01:30:52,910 --> 01:30:55,790
Well something's lost

1199
01:30:55,830 --> 01:30:57,660
But something's gained

1200
01:30:59,080 --> 01:31:02,420
In living every day

1201
01:31:02,670 --> 01:31:05,760
- Has she noticed you yet?
- No.

1202
01:31:05,800 --> 01:31:10,470
But the thing about romance is people
only get together right at the very end.

1203
01:31:10,510 --> 01:31:12,720
Of course.

1204
01:31:13,810 --> 01:31:17,680
By the way, I feel bad. I never ask you
how your love life is going.

1205
01:31:17,730 --> 01:31:19,730
Er-huh!

1206
01:31:19,770 --> 01:31:21,600
No.

1207
01:31:21,650 --> 01:31:24,610
As you know,
that was a done deal long ago.

1208
01:31:25,900 --> 01:31:30,910
Unless Claudia Schiffer calls, in which case
I want you out of here straightaway,

1209
01:31:30,950 --> 01:31:34,200
- you wee motherless mongrel.
- Oh!

1210
01:31:34,240 --> 01:31:38,120
No, no. We'll want to have sex
in every room, including yours.

1211
01:31:38,870 --> 01:31:41,960
'It's a rainy Christmas Eve all over the UK

1212
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:46,130
'and the question is who is number one
on the Radio One chart show tonight?

1213
01:31:46,170 --> 01:31:50,180
'Is it Blue or the unexpected
Christmas sensation from Billy Mack?

1214
01:31:50,220 --> 01:31:54,140
'You might have guessed it
although you may not believe it.

1215
01:31:54,180 --> 01:31:56,430
'It's Billy Mack.'

1216
01:31:58,600 --> 01:32:01,310
- You are the champion!
-  Shh.

1217
01:32:01,350 --> 01:32:03,360
- 'Hi, Billy.'
- Hello.

1218
01:32:03,400 --> 01:32:07,230
'We're live across the nation
and you're number one.

1219
01:32:07,280 --> 01:32:09,900
- 'How will you be celebrating? '
- I don't know.

1220
01:32:09,940 --> 01:32:13,160
Er, either I could behave like
a real rock'n'roll loser

1221
01:32:13,200 --> 01:32:15,950
and get drunk with my fat manager...

1222
01:32:15,990 --> 01:32:18,120
or, when I hang up,

1223
01:32:18,200 --> 01:32:23,080
I'll be flooded by invitations
to a large number of glamorous parties.

1224
01:32:23,120 --> 01:32:26,800
'Let's hope it's the latter. Here it is.
Number one, from Billy Mack,

1225
01:32:26,840 --> 01:32:31,090
- 'it's Christmas Is All Around.'
- Oh, Jesus, not that crap again.

1226
01:32:31,130 --> 01:32:33,800
I feel it in my fingers...

1227
01:32:33,840 --> 01:32:36,350
Bill, it's for you, babe.

1228
01:32:37,350 --> 01:32:39,850
Hello. Elton.

1229
01:32:39,890 --> 01:32:43,400
O-Of course. Of course.

1230
01:32:43,440 --> 01:32:46,860
Send an embarrassingly big car
and I'll be there.

1231
01:32:48,650 --> 01:32:52,360
It's gonna be a very good Christmas.

1232
01:33:00,330 --> 01:33:03,120
- Right.
- I'd better be getting inside, actually.

1233
01:33:03,160 --> 01:33:07,380
- My mum and... you know.
- Of course, yeah. It's getting a bit cold.

1234
01:33:07,420 --> 01:33:09,920
Erm...

1235
01:33:09,960 --> 01:33:12,800
- Well, good night.
- Night.

1236
01:33:15,390 --> 01:33:17,300
Er...

1237
01:33:22,680 --> 01:33:25,770
Er... OK.

1238
01:33:38,490 --> 01:33:41,200
All I want for Christmas...

1239
01:33:41,240 --> 01:33:44,790
is you.

1240
01:33:44,830 --> 01:33:47,420
Right.

1241
01:33:47,460 --> 01:33:50,500
Thank you. Good.

1242
01:33:50,550 --> 01:33:52,460
Good night.

1243
01:33:53,550 --> 01:33:56,890
Ha ha ha! Ho.

1244
01:33:56,930 --> 01:34:01,180
I'm, I'm dreaming

1245
01:34:02,470 --> 01:34:06,060
Dreaming of a white...

1246
01:34:06,190 --> 01:34:08,770
Oh, look, everyone, it's Uncle Jamie.

1247
01:34:08,810 --> 01:34:11,690
Hi, Uncle Jamie!

1248
01:34:11,730 --> 01:34:16,030
Yes, oh, splendid. It's lovely to see you all.

1249
01:34:16,070 --> 01:34:18,570
And, er...

1250
01:34:19,660 --> 01:34:21,030
I'm off, actually.

1251
01:34:21,080 --> 01:34:24,000
But Jamie, darling.

1252
01:34:24,040 --> 01:34:26,620
Sorry.

1253
01:34:26,670 --> 01:34:29,330
Man's gotta do what a man's gotta do.

1254
01:34:32,420 --> 01:34:34,380
I hate Uncle Jamie!

1255
01:34:34,420 --> 01:34:37,720
- I hate Uncle Jamie.
-  I hate Uncle Jamie.

1256
01:34:37,800 --> 01:34:39,930
And try to listen

1257
01:34:41,640 --> 01:34:44,720
To hear

1258
01:34:44,810 --> 01:34:47,100
Hear for the sleigh bells

1259
01:34:47,140 --> 01:34:49,230
That are ringing in the snow...

1260
01:34:49,270 --> 01:34:52,190
Gatwick airport, please. Fast as you can.

1261
01:34:56,570 --> 01:34:59,070
l-l-I

1262
01:35:00,160 --> 01:35:02,200
I'm dreaming

1263
01:35:04,240 --> 01:35:06,960
Of a white...

1264
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:09,790
- Night, Sarah.
- Night, Karl.

1265
01:35:10,710 --> 01:35:12,790
I, er...

1266
01:35:16,840 --> 01:35:19,760
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

1267
01:35:24,350 --> 01:35:27,850
I want you to know, may your day

1268
01:35:27,890 --> 01:35:31,100
May your day

1269
01:35:31,150 --> 01:35:35,530
Be so merry, merry and bright...

1270
01:35:40,110 --> 01:35:43,160
Hi, babe, how's it going? Yeah.

1271
01:35:43,200 --> 01:35:45,870
Is it all party, party, party down there?

1272
01:35:45,950 --> 01:35:48,040
All of your Christmases

1273
01:35:49,120 --> 01:35:51,710
And may all

1274
01:35:51,750 --> 01:35:55,130
And may all of your Christmases

1275
01:35:56,630 --> 01:35:58,510
Baby may your days

1276
01:35:58,550 --> 01:36:02,300
May your days be merry

1277
01:36:02,390 --> 01:36:04,600
Merry, so merry...

1278
01:36:04,640 --> 01:36:07,810
- Sam, time for dinner.
- I'm not hungry.

1279
01:36:07,850 --> 01:36:11,390
Sam, I've done chicken kebabs.

1280
01:36:11,440 --> 01:36:13,610
Look at the sign on the door.

1281
01:36:17,730 --> 01:36:19,820
Right.

1282
01:36:25,580 --> 01:36:28,330
It's a little long.

1283
01:36:28,370 --> 01:36:34,380
Dreaming,
dreaming of a white, white Christmas...

1284
01:36:36,460 --> 01:36:38,550
I'll get it.

1285
01:36:44,720 --> 01:36:47,720
- Oh, hi.
-  Who is it?

1286
01:36:52,270 --> 01:36:54,100
It's carol singers.

1287
01:36:54,230 --> 01:36:56,310
Give them a quid and tell them to bugger off.

1288
01:36:59,990 --> 01:37:04,910
Silent night

1289
01:37:04,950 --> 01:37:09,330
Holy night

1290
01:37:09,450 --> 01:37:13,870
All is calm

1291
01:37:13,920 --> 01:37:18,380
All is bright

1292
01:37:18,420 --> 01:37:23,010
Round yon virgin

1293
01:37:23,050 --> 01:37:27,430
Mother and child

1294
01:37:27,470 --> 01:37:31,560
Holy infant

1295
01:37:31,600 --> 01:37:36,230
So tender and mild

1296
01:37:36,270 --> 01:37:44,400
Sleep in heavenly peace

1297
01:37:45,700 --> 01:37:51,040
Sleep in heavenly peace

1298
01:37:54,790 --> 01:37:58,920
Silent night

1299
01:37:58,960 --> 01:38:03,470
Holy night

1300
01:38:03,550 --> 01:38:07,800
Shepherds quake

1301
01:38:07,840 --> 01:38:09,850
At the sight...

1302
01:38:09,890 --> 01:38:12,020
Merry Christmas.

1303
01:38:12,060 --> 01:38:16,350
Glories stream

1304
01:38:16,390 --> 01:38:20,820
From heaven afar

1305
01:38:21,520 --> 01:38:30,370
Heavenly hosts sing alleluia

1306
01:38:30,410 --> 01:38:38,540
Christ the saviour is born

1307
01:38:39,630 --> 01:38:45,170
Christ the saviour is born

1308
01:38:48,220 --> 01:38:50,930
Enough.

1309
01:38:50,970 --> 01:38:52,890
Enough now.

1310
01:39:00,310 --> 01:39:04,990
What the hell are you doing here?
You're supposed to be at Elton John's.

1311
01:39:05,030 --> 01:39:10,240
Well, I was there for a minute or two
and then I had an epiphany.

1312
01:39:10,280 --> 01:39:12,700
- Really?
- Yeah.

1313
01:39:12,780 --> 01:39:14,870
Come on. Just come up.

1314
01:39:14,910 --> 01:39:18,080
So what was this epiphany?

1315
01:39:18,120 --> 01:39:20,920
Erm, it... it was about Christmas.

1316
01:39:20,960 --> 01:39:23,250
You realised it was all around.

1317
01:39:23,300 --> 01:39:27,720
No. I realised that Christmas is the time
to be with the people you love.

1318
01:39:28,800 --> 01:39:30,340
Right.

1319
01:39:30,390 --> 01:39:37,230
And I realised that, as dire chance
and fateful cockup would have it,

1320
01:39:37,270 --> 01:39:39,310
here I am,

1321
01:39:39,350 --> 01:39:41,690
mid-fifties,

1322
01:39:41,730 --> 01:39:44,940
and without knowing it,
I've spent most of my adult life

1323
01:39:44,980 --> 01:39:48,820
with a chubby employee.

1324
01:39:48,860 --> 01:39:51,610
And, much as it grieves me to say it,

1325
01:39:51,660 --> 01:39:57,450
it might be that the people I love is, in fact...

1326
01:39:58,580 --> 01:40:01,460
you.

1327
01:40:02,580 --> 01:40:04,670
Well, this is a surprise.

1328
01:40:04,710 --> 01:40:06,500
Yeah.

1329
01:40:06,630 --> 01:40:08,880
Ten minutes at Elton John's and you're gay?

1330
01:40:08,920 --> 01:40:11,010
No, look. I'm serious here.

1331
01:40:11,050 --> 01:40:16,930
I left Elton's and a hefty number
of half-naked chicks with their mouths open

1332
01:40:16,970 --> 01:40:21,310
in order to hang out with you at Christmas.

1333
01:40:22,900 --> 01:40:28,320
- Well, Bill...
- It's a terrible, terrible mistake, chubs...

1334
01:40:32,160 --> 01:40:35,490
but you turn out to be
the fucking love of my life.

1335
01:40:38,950 --> 01:40:42,870
And to be honest,
despite all my complaining...

1336
01:40:44,750 --> 01:40:47,210
we have had a wonderful life.

1337
01:40:51,720 --> 01:40:53,470
Well...

1338
01:40:55,220 --> 01:40:57,430
thank you.

1339
01:40:59,100 --> 01:41:02,140
I mean, come on, it's been an honour.

1340
01:41:03,690 --> 01:41:06,060
I feel very proud.

1341
01:41:06,110 --> 01:41:08,270
Oh, look, don't be a moron.

1342
01:41:19,160 --> 01:41:22,620
Come on, let's get pissed and watch porn.

1343
01:41:42,060 --> 01:41:44,600
'Dear sir, Dear David,

1344
01:41:44,640 --> 01:41:48,110
'Merry Christmas and I hope you have
a very happy New Year.

1345
01:41:48,150 --> 01:41:50,690
'I'm very sorry
about the thing that happened.

1346
01:41:50,730 --> 01:41:53,860
'It was a very odd moment
and I feel like a prize idiot.

1347
01:41:53,900 --> 01:41:55,820
'Particularly because -

1348
01:41:55,860 --> 01:41:58,660
'if you can't say it at Christmas,
when can you, eh? -

1349
01:41:58,740 --> 01:42:02,500
'I'm actually yours. With love, your Natalie.'

1350
01:42:22,430 --> 01:42:24,640
Jack, yeah, I need a car.

1351
01:42:24,680 --> 01:42:26,770
Right now. Thank you.

1352
01:42:38,410 --> 01:42:40,740
Oh, don't wait up.

1353
01:42:44,500 --> 01:42:46,830
I'd like to go to Wandsworth, the dodgy end.

1354
01:42:46,870 --> 01:42:49,130
Very good, sir.

1355
01:42:49,170 --> 01:42:52,840
Tell me how you want me

1356
01:42:52,880 --> 01:42:56,550
I can feel it in your heart beat

1357
01:42:56,680 --> 01:42:59,640
I know you like what you see...

1358
01:42:59,720 --> 01:43:02,640
Harris Street. What number, sir?

1359
01:43:02,680 --> 01:43:07,600
Oh, God, it's the longest street
in the world and I have absolutely no idea.

1360
01:43:07,640 --> 01:43:10,610
Wrap your love around me

1361
01:43:10,650 --> 01:43:13,650
You're so excited
I can feel you getting hotter

1362
01:43:15,740 --> 01:43:17,650
Hello, does Natalie live here?

1363
01:43:17,700 --> 01:43:21,200
- No.
- Right, fine, thank you. Sorry to disturb.

1364
01:43:21,240 --> 01:43:23,410
Here, aren't...

1365
01:43:23,450 --> 01:43:26,830
Aren't you the Prime Minister?

1366
01:43:26,870 --> 01:43:31,580
- Er, yes. In fact, I am. Merry Christmas.
- Oh.

1367
01:43:31,630 --> 01:43:35,510
Part of the service now. Trying to get round
everyone by New Year's Eve.

1368
01:43:39,720 --> 01:43:43,050
Ah. Hello. Does Natalie live here?

1369
01:43:43,100 --> 01:43:45,770
- No, she doesn't.
- Oh dear. OK.

1370
01:43:45,810 --> 01:43:49,100
- Are you singing carols?
- Er, no. No, I'm not.

1371
01:43:49,140 --> 01:43:52,400
- Please, sir, please.
- Please.

1372
01:43:55,230 --> 01:43:57,110
Well, I suppose I could.

1373
01:43:57,150 --> 01:43:59,030
Please.

1374
01:44:00,360 --> 01:44:02,620
All right.

1375
01:44:04,950 --> 01:44:07,950
Good King Wenceslas looked out

1376
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:11,750
On the feast of Stephen

1377
01:44:11,790 --> 01:44:15,300
When the snow lay round about

1378
01:44:15,340 --> 01:44:18,800
Deep and crisp and even

1379
01:44:18,840 --> 01:44:22,390
Brightly shone the moon that night

1380
01:44:22,430 --> 01:44:25,010
Hello. Sorry to disturb.

1381
01:44:25,060 --> 01:44:28,060
- Does Natalie live here?
- No.

1382
01:44:28,100 --> 01:44:30,230
She lives next door.

1383
01:44:32,730 --> 01:44:35,360
Ah. Brilliant.

1384
01:44:35,440 --> 01:44:38,400
You're not who I think you are, are you?

1385
01:44:38,490 --> 01:44:40,570
Yes and I'm sorry about all the cockups.

1386
01:44:40,650 --> 01:44:44,070
My cabinet are absolute crap.
We hope to do better next year.

1387
01:44:44,120 --> 01:44:46,370
Merry Christmas to you.

1388
01:45:01,130 --> 01:45:05,010
Ah. Hello.

1389
01:45:05,050 --> 01:45:07,310
Is, er, Natalie in?

1390
01:45:07,350 --> 01:45:10,270
Oh, where the fuck is my fucking coat?

1391
01:45:11,600 --> 01:45:15,520
- Oh. Hello.
- Hello.

1392
01:45:15,560 --> 01:45:20,690
Erm, this is my mum and my dad
and my Uncle Tony and my Auntie Glynne.

1393
01:45:20,740 --> 01:45:22,700
- Hello.
- Very nice to meet you.

1394
01:45:22,740 --> 01:45:26,570
And, erm... this is the Prime Minister.

1395
01:45:26,620 --> 01:45:29,540
Yes, we can see that, darling.

1396
01:45:29,580 --> 01:45:32,460
And erm, unfortunately, we're very late.

1397
01:45:32,500 --> 01:45:35,580
It's the school Christmas concert,
you see, David.

1398
01:45:35,670 --> 01:45:39,090
All the local schools have joined together,
even St Basil's...

1399
01:45:39,130 --> 01:45:43,010
- Too much detail, Mum.
- Anyway, how can we help, sir?

1400
01:45:43,050 --> 01:45:46,970
Well, I... just needed Natalie...

1401
01:45:49,760 --> 01:45:51,810
on some state business.

1402
01:45:51,890 --> 01:45:56,480
- Oh.
- Right, yes. Of course.

1403
01:45:56,520 --> 01:45:58,320
Right, er...

1404
01:45:58,360 --> 01:46:01,110
Well, perhaps you should
come on later, Plumpy.

1405
01:46:01,150 --> 01:46:02,570
Er, Natalie.

1406
01:46:02,610 --> 01:46:05,160
I don't want to make you late for the concert.

1407
01:46:05,200 --> 01:46:08,870
- No, it's nothing, really.
- Keith'll be very disappointed.

1408
01:46:08,910 --> 01:46:13,080
- No, really, it doesn't matter.
- The octopus costume's taken me months.

1409
01:46:13,160 --> 01:46:15,170
Eight is a lot of legs, David.

1410
01:46:15,250 --> 01:46:17,750
Mm. Erm...

1411
01:46:19,540 --> 01:46:21,670
Listen, why don't I give you a lift

1412
01:46:21,710 --> 01:46:26,840
and then we can talk about
this state business business in the car.

1413
01:46:28,390 --> 01:46:29,930
OK.

1414
01:46:29,970 --> 01:46:32,850
- Lovely, yes.
- Thank you.

1415
01:46:32,890 --> 01:46:35,020
Hold tight, everybody.

1416
01:46:41,610 --> 01:46:44,440
- How far is this place?
- Just round the corner.

1417
01:46:44,490 --> 01:46:47,200
Ah, right. Well, er...

1418
01:46:49,120 --> 01:46:51,370
I just wanted to say...

1419
01:46:53,290 --> 01:46:55,460
thank you for the Christmas card.

1420
01:46:55,500 --> 01:46:57,330
You're welcome.

1421
01:46:57,370 --> 01:46:59,330
Look, I'm so sorry about that day.

1422
01:46:59,380 --> 01:47:02,710
I came in and he slinked towards me
and there was a fire

1423
01:47:02,750 --> 01:47:07,260
and he's the President of the United States
and nothing happened, I promise.

1424
01:47:07,300 --> 01:47:10,470
I just felt like such a fool because...

1425
01:47:10,510 --> 01:47:13,810
I think about you all the time, actually.

1426
01:47:13,850 --> 01:47:17,310
- And I think you're the man that I really...
- We're here.

1427
01:47:17,350 --> 01:47:18,980
...Iove.
- Oh, wow.

1428
01:47:19,020 --> 01:47:21,690
That really was just round the corner. Er...

1429
01:47:23,440 --> 01:47:25,490
Erm...

1430
01:47:27,950 --> 01:47:30,200
Ow!

1431
01:47:36,750 --> 01:47:39,000
Well, look, I...

1432
01:47:40,790 --> 01:47:43,300
I think I'd better not come in, you know?

1433
01:47:44,250 --> 01:47:47,880
Nobody wants some politician
stealing the kids' thunder.

1434
01:47:47,920 --> 01:47:51,510
No, please come. It'll be great.

1435
01:47:51,550 --> 01:47:54,260
No, I'd... I'd better not.

1436
01:47:55,350 --> 01:48:00,190
But I will be very sorry

1437
01:48:00,270 --> 01:48:02,360
to drive away from you.

1438
01:48:03,820 --> 01:48:06,030
Just give me one second.

1439
01:48:19,960 --> 01:48:23,130
John's been very mysterious.
Where did you two meet?

1440
01:48:23,170 --> 01:48:26,300
- Erm... erm...
- Um... um...

1441
01:48:29,380 --> 01:48:31,470
No!

1442
01:49:02,790 --> 01:49:06,460
Come on in. We can watch from backstage.

1443
01:49:06,500 --> 01:49:08,710
OK. Terry, I won't be long.

1444
01:49:12,180 --> 01:49:15,100
Look, this has to be a very secret visit, OK?

1445
01:49:15,140 --> 01:49:19,310
Don't worry. This was my school.
I know my way around. Come on.

1446
01:49:22,020 --> 01:49:25,270
Look, the sheep are ready already
and you're not even...

1447
01:49:25,310 --> 01:49:29,360
- Oh, David.
- Ah!

1448
01:49:29,400 --> 01:49:31,700
Oh, how are you?

1449
01:49:31,820 --> 01:49:35,870
Hi, guys. Hey, hey, hey. You all right?

1450
01:49:35,950 --> 01:49:38,080
What the hell are you doing here?

1451
01:49:38,120 --> 01:49:41,160
- Well, you know...
- We always tell your secretary

1452
01:49:41,200 --> 01:49:45,920
that these things are going on but it never
occurred to me you'd actually turn up.

1453
01:49:46,040 --> 01:49:47,920
I thought it was time I did.

1454
01:49:47,960 --> 01:49:51,380
I didn't want anyone to see,
so I'm gonna hide somewhere.

1455
01:49:51,420 --> 01:49:53,880
Good luck, Daisy, good luck, Bernie.

1456
01:49:53,930 --> 01:49:57,680
I've never been gladder
to see my stupid big brother.

1457
01:49:57,720 --> 01:50:01,020
- Thank you.
- All right.

1458
01:50:01,060 --> 01:50:04,020
Oh, now. We haven't been introduced.

1459
01:50:04,060 --> 01:50:07,150
Right. Well, this is Gavin.

1460
01:50:07,190 --> 01:50:09,440
- Hello, Gavin.
- My copper.

1461
01:50:09,520 --> 01:50:11,570
And this is Natalie, who's my, erm...

1462
01:50:11,610 --> 01:50:14,490
- who's my, erm, catering manager.
- Oh.

1463
01:50:14,570 --> 01:50:16,610
- Hi.
- Catering manager.

1464
01:50:16,700 --> 01:50:18,740
Watch he keeps his hands off you.

1465
01:50:18,780 --> 01:50:20,990
20 years ago, you'd have been his type.

1466
01:50:21,040 --> 01:50:26,000
I'll be very careful. Don't try something, sir,
just because it's Christmas.

1467
01:50:26,040 --> 01:50:28,210
No, seriously.

1468
01:50:28,250 --> 01:50:30,630
Come on. Showtime. Quickly.

1469
01:50:30,670 --> 01:50:33,340
- Look, see you after, yeah?
- Probably.

1470
01:50:33,380 --> 01:50:36,340
- Thank you, Prime Minister.
- It's all right.

1471
01:50:36,380 --> 01:50:38,600
- Come on.
- Right.

1472
01:50:38,640 --> 01:50:41,890
Catch a falling star
and put it in your pocket

1473
01:50:42,020 --> 01:50:46,600
Save it for a rainy day

1474
01:50:46,650 --> 01:50:50,730
Catch a falling star
And put it in your pocket

1475
01:50:50,770 --> 01:50:53,940
Never let it fade away

1476
01:50:55,030 --> 01:50:59,120
Never let it fade away

1477
01:50:59,740 --> 01:51:04,910
Never let it fade away

1478
01:51:12,590 --> 01:51:16,170
Hillier School would now like to present
their Christmas number.

1479
01:51:16,220 --> 01:51:19,180
Lead vocals by ten-year-old
Joanna Anderson,

1480
01:51:19,220 --> 01:51:21,850
backing vocals coordinated by her mother,

1481
01:51:21,890 --> 01:51:24,140
the great Mrs Jean Anderson.

1482
01:51:24,180 --> 01:51:27,100
Erm, some of the staff
have decided to help out

1483
01:51:27,140 --> 01:51:31,690
and for this, we ask you to forgive us.

1484
01:51:31,730 --> 01:51:33,610
Thank you.

1485
01:51:39,320 --> 01:51:42,950
I don't want a lot for Christmas

1486
01:51:42,990 --> 01:51:47,330
There's just one thing I need

1487
01:51:47,370 --> 01:51:50,710
I don't care about the presents

1488
01:51:50,750 --> 01:51:54,670
Underneath the Christmas tree

1489
01:51:54,710 --> 01:51:58,430
I just want you for my own

1490
01:51:58,470 --> 01:52:02,260
More than you could ever know

1491
01:52:02,300 --> 01:52:06,270
Make my wish come true

1492
01:52:06,310 --> 01:52:10,480
All I want for Christmas

1493
01:52:10,520 --> 01:52:18,240
Is you

1494
01:52:20,280 --> 01:52:22,910
I don't want a lot for Christmas

1495
01:52:22,990 --> 01:52:26,290
There's just one thing I need

1496
01:52:26,330 --> 01:52:29,330
I don't care about the presents

1497
01:52:29,370 --> 01:52:32,580
Underneath the Christmas tree

1498
01:52:32,630 --> 01:52:35,960
I just want you for my own

1499
01:52:36,050 --> 01:52:38,970
More than you could ever know

1500
01:52:39,010 --> 01:52:42,140
Make my wish come true

1501
01:52:42,220 --> 01:52:46,890
All I want for Christmas is you

1502
01:52:48,520 --> 01:52:50,850
You baby

1503
01:52:50,890 --> 01:52:54,810
Oh, all the lights are shining

1504
01:52:54,860 --> 01:52:58,990
So brightly everywhere

1505
01:52:59,030 --> 01:53:02,820
And the sound of children's laughter
fills the air

1506
01:53:02,860 --> 01:53:05,280
Laughter fills the air

1507
01:53:05,330 --> 01:53:08,290
Everyone is singing
Oh yeah

1508
01:53:08,330 --> 01:53:10,750
I hear those sleigh bells ringing

1509
01:53:10,830 --> 01:53:13,630
Santa won't you bring me my honey

1510
01:53:13,670 --> 01:53:17,170
Won't you please bring my baby to me

1511
01:53:17,210 --> 01:53:20,170
I don't want a lot for Christmas

1512
01:53:20,220 --> 01:53:23,760
This is all I'm asking for
All I'm asking for

1513
01:53:23,800 --> 01:53:26,760
I just wanna see my baby

1514
01:53:26,810 --> 01:53:30,020
Standing right outside my door

1515
01:53:30,060 --> 01:53:32,730
Cos I just want you for my own

1516
01:53:32,770 --> 01:53:36,150
More than you could ever know
You will ever know

1517
01:53:36,190 --> 01:53:39,530
Make my wish come true

1518
01:53:39,570 --> 01:53:43,740
All I want for Christmas

1519
01:53:43,780 --> 01:53:47,410
Is you

1520
01:53:47,490 --> 01:53:49,790
All I want for Christmas

1521
01:53:49,830 --> 01:53:53,330
And you and you

1522
01:53:53,460 --> 01:53:56,330
And you and you
All I want for Christmas

1523
01:53:57,210 --> 01:54:00,800
All I want for Christmas

1524
01:54:17,020 --> 01:54:19,020
Right.

1525
01:54:22,030 --> 01:54:24,400
So, not quite as secret as we'd hoped.

1526
01:54:24,450 --> 01:54:26,740
- What do we do now?
- Smile.

1527
01:54:27,820 --> 01:54:29,910
Little bow.

1528
01:54:33,330 --> 01:54:35,460
And a wave.

1529
01:54:48,760 --> 01:54:52,020
Absolutely no idea.
I mean, can you imagine?

1530
01:54:52,060 --> 01:54:54,180
I'll see you later, all right?

1531
01:54:54,230 --> 01:54:56,390
I'll speak to you. Bye.

1532
01:54:58,810 --> 01:55:02,980
Tell me, if you were in my position,
what would you do?

1533
01:55:03,030 --> 01:55:05,110
What position is that?

1534
01:55:05,150 --> 01:55:08,910
Imagine your husband
bought a gold necklace

1535
01:55:08,950 --> 01:55:12,080
and, come Christmas,
gave it to somebody else.

1536
01:55:12,120 --> 01:55:14,910
- Oh, Karen...
- Would you wait around to find out...

1537
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:17,620
- Good night.
- Night, darling. Happy Christmas.

1538
01:55:17,670 --> 01:55:20,670
Would you wait around to find out
if it's just a necklace

1539
01:55:20,710 --> 01:55:23,130
or if it's sex and a necklace

1540
01:55:23,210 --> 01:55:26,880
or if, worst of all, it's a necklace and love?

1541
01:55:28,180 --> 01:55:33,310
Would you stay? Knowing life
would always be a little bit worse?

1542
01:55:33,390 --> 01:55:36,850
- Or would you cut and run?
- Oh, God.

1543
01:55:41,480 --> 01:55:44,280
I am so in the wrong.

1544
01:55:44,320 --> 01:55:46,360
A classic fool.

1545
01:55:46,490 --> 01:55:49,660
Yes, but you've also made a fool out of me.

1546
01:55:49,700 --> 01:55:52,580
You've made the life I lead foolish, too.

1547
01:55:54,950 --> 01:55:57,960
Darling. Ooh, darlings!

1548
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:01,210
Oh, you were wonderful.

1549
01:56:01,250 --> 01:56:04,300
My little lobster, you were so...

1550
01:56:04,340 --> 01:56:06,670
What is that word?

1551
01:56:06,720 --> 01:56:08,970
Orange.

1552
01:56:09,010 --> 01:56:12,100
Come on, I've got treats at home.
Dad's coming.

1553
01:56:13,560 --> 01:56:18,310
Sammy! Fantastic show!
Classic drumming, son.

1554
01:56:18,350 --> 01:56:22,440
- Thanks. Plan didn't work, though.
- Tell her, then.

1555
01:56:22,480 --> 01:56:24,400
- Tell her what?
- That you love her.

1556
01:56:24,440 --> 01:56:27,400
No way. Anyway, they fly tonight.

1557
01:56:27,440 --> 01:56:32,780
Even better. Sam, you've got nothing to lose
and you'll always regret it if you don't.

1558
01:56:34,410 --> 01:56:36,620
I never told your mum enough.

1559
01:56:36,660 --> 01:56:41,120
I should have told her every day
because she was perfect every day.

1560
01:56:42,250 --> 01:56:46,590
You've seen the films, kiddo.
It ain't over till it's over.

1561
01:56:48,510 --> 01:56:53,260
OK, Dad. Let's do it. Let's go get the shit
kicked out of us by love.

1562
01:56:53,300 --> 01:56:55,600
Yes.

1563
01:56:55,720 --> 01:56:58,020
- Just give me one sec.
- Yeah.

1564
01:56:59,560 --> 01:57:02,440
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Sorry.

1565
01:57:02,480 --> 01:57:04,650
That's OK.

1566
01:57:04,690 --> 01:57:08,150
- My fault.
- No, no, really, it wasn't.

1567
01:57:08,190 --> 01:57:11,110
You're Sam's dad, aren't you?

1568
01:57:11,150 --> 01:57:14,120
Yeah. Stepdad, actually.

1569
01:57:14,160 --> 01:57:16,950
- Daniel.
- I'm Carol.

1570
01:57:16,990 --> 01:57:18,790
Carol.

1571
01:57:18,830 --> 01:57:23,250
- OK, I'm back. Let's go.
- Yeah. Well...

1572
01:57:24,630 --> 01:57:26,960
I hope we'll meet again, Karen.

1573
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:29,210
Carol.

1574
01:57:30,590 --> 01:57:35,220
- I'll make sure we do.
- Yeah? Good.

1575
01:57:43,060 --> 01:57:45,150
- Tell her.
- What?

1576
01:57:45,190 --> 01:57:48,230
- You know...
- Don't be such an arse.

1577
01:57:51,860 --> 01:57:53,990
- Look, there she is.
- Where?

1578
01:57:54,030 --> 01:57:56,320
Over there.

1579
01:57:58,160 --> 01:58:00,200
Oh, no.

1580
01:58:01,290 --> 01:58:04,290
It's OK, we'll go to the airport.
I know a short cut.

1581
01:58:19,470 --> 01:58:21,600
Good evening.

1582
01:58:21,640 --> 01:58:24,690
- Senhor Barros?
- Sim.

1583
01:58:24,730 --> 01:58:28,440
I am here to ask your daughter

1584
01:58:28,520 --> 01:58:30,480
for her hands in marriage.

1585
01:58:30,530 --> 01:58:32,740
You want to marry my daughter?

1586
01:58:32,780 --> 01:58:34,700
Yes.

1587
01:58:34,740 --> 01:58:36,200
Come here,

1588
01:58:36,240 --> 01:58:37,780
there is a man at the door.

1589
01:58:39,370 --> 01:58:41,620
He wants to marry you.

1590
01:58:41,660 --> 01:58:43,000
But I've never seen him before.

1591
01:58:43,040 --> 01:58:44,460
Who cares?

1592
01:58:44,500 --> 01:58:46,750
You're going to sell me
to a complete stranger?

1593
01:58:46,830 --> 01:58:49,840
Sell? Who said sell? I'll pay him.

1594
01:58:49,920 --> 01:58:54,630
Pardon me. I'm meaning
your other daughter - Aurelia.

1595
01:58:54,670 --> 01:58:58,430
She's not here - she's at work. I'll take you.

1596
01:58:58,470 --> 01:58:59,970
You! Stay here.

1597
01:59:00,060 --> 01:59:02,930
As if I would. Stupid!

1598
01:59:05,890 --> 01:59:10,690
Father is about to sell Aurelia
as a slave to this Englishman.

1599
01:59:14,490 --> 01:59:16,570
Wait. Wait.

1600
01:59:19,910 --> 01:59:21,330
Oh, no.

1601
01:59:22,830 --> 01:59:24,700
You better not say yes, Father.

1602
01:59:24,750 --> 01:59:27,750
Shut up, Miss Dunkin' Donut 2003.

1603
01:59:32,880 --> 01:59:36,470
- Look, we're not actually flying.
- You can't come through.

1604
01:59:36,550 --> 01:59:40,970
Not even to let the boy say goodbye
to the love of his life?

1605
01:59:42,720 --> 01:59:44,640
No.

1606
01:59:46,730 --> 01:59:49,940
- I'm sorry, Sam.
- Boarding pass, sir?

1607
01:59:49,980 --> 01:59:53,570
Just a moment, I know I've got it.
Would you hang on to that?

1608
01:59:53,610 --> 01:59:55,650
- Unless...
- What?

1609
01:59:55,690 --> 01:59:58,280
- Do you want to make a run for it?
- Hold on to that.

1610
01:59:58,320 --> 02:00:00,870
- You think I should?
- Yeah.

1611
02:00:01,490 --> 02:00:04,620
- OK.
- Yes!

1612
02:00:04,660 --> 02:00:09,040
I must have left them
where I was having a cup of coffee.

1613
02:01:21,860 --> 02:01:24,530
Apparently he is going to kill Aurelia.

1614
02:01:24,570 --> 02:01:26,740
Cool!

1615
02:02:00,990 --> 02:02:03,070
Joanna.

1616
02:02:04,110 --> 02:02:06,160
Sam?

1617
02:02:09,450 --> 02:02:13,710
- I thought you didn't know my name.
- Course I do.

1618
02:02:13,750 --> 02:02:17,460
Oh, Jesus. Here, I've gotta run.

1619
02:03:09,970 --> 02:03:12,560
- Where is Aurelia?
- Why should I tell you?

1620
02:03:12,640 --> 02:03:14,640
This man wants to marry her.

1621
02:03:14,680 --> 02:03:17,440
He can't do that - she's our best waitress.

1622
02:03:36,370 --> 02:03:38,170
Boa noite, Aurelia.

1623
02:03:39,710 --> 02:03:41,800
Boa noite, Jamie.

1624
02:03:57,100 --> 02:04:00,110
Beautiful Aurelia...

1625
02:04:00,150 --> 02:04:04,400
I've come here with a view to asking you...

1626
02:04:05,490 --> 02:04:07,650
to marriage me.

1627
02:04:08,990 --> 02:04:13,830
I know I seems an insane person
because I hardly knows you

1628
02:04:15,450 --> 02:04:22,460
but sometimes things are so transparency,

1629
02:04:23,800 --> 02:04:27,170
they don't need evidential proof.

1630
02:04:29,090 --> 02:04:35,100
And I will inhabit here,
or you can inhabit with me in England.

1631
02:04:35,140 --> 02:04:37,680
Definitely go for England, girl.

1632
02:04:37,730 --> 02:04:40,980
You'll meet Prince William -
then you can marry him instead.

1633
02:04:42,020 --> 02:04:48,030
Of course I don't expecting you
to be as foolish as me,

1634
02:04:48,900 --> 02:04:53,620
and of course I prediction you say no...

1635
02:04:54,700 --> 02:05:02,630
but it's Christmas
and I just wanted to... check.

1636
02:05:06,840 --> 02:05:10,470
Oh, God - say yes, you skinny moron.

1637
02:05:13,260 --> 02:05:15,350
Thank you.

1638
02:05:17,140 --> 02:05:19,230
That will be nice.

1639
02:05:21,480 --> 02:05:24,270
Yes is being my answer.

1640
02:05:25,980 --> 02:05:28,280
Easy question.

1641
02:05:28,320 --> 02:05:30,780
What did you say?

1642
02:05:30,820 --> 02:05:32,200
Yes, of course.

1643
02:05:34,950 --> 02:05:37,290
Bravo!

1644
02:06:02,690 --> 02:06:04,810
You learned English?

1645
02:06:05,310 --> 02:06:07,520
Just in cases.

1646
02:06:41,100 --> 02:06:43,940
I may not always love you

1647
02:06:44,890 --> 02:06:48,400
But long as there are stars above you...

1648
02:06:48,480 --> 02:06:49,900
Hello, Daisy.

1649
02:06:49,940 --> 02:06:52,900
- This one's Greta.
- Hello, Greta.

1650
02:06:52,940 --> 02:06:55,320
I'll make you so sure about it...

1651
02:06:55,360 --> 02:06:59,410
Here she is. This is Aurelia.
This is Juliet. This is Peter.

1652
02:06:59,450 --> 02:07:02,660
- Mark, didn't see you there.
- Just thought I'd tag along.

1653
02:07:02,700 --> 02:07:05,580
Jamie's friends are so good-Iooking.

1654
02:07:05,710 --> 02:07:07,960
He never tells me this.

1655
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:11,170
I think maybe now
I have made the wrong choice,

1656
02:07:11,210 --> 02:07:12,920
picked wrong Englishman.

1657
02:07:12,960 --> 02:07:15,180
She can't speak English properly.

1658
02:07:16,050 --> 02:07:18,220
Dad! Dad!

1659
02:07:20,390 --> 02:07:22,060
Oh, God.

1660
02:07:22,100 --> 02:07:25,310
- Did you get us any presents?
- Matter of fact, I did.

1661
02:07:25,350 --> 02:07:27,810
Thanks, Dad.

1662
02:07:30,320 --> 02:07:33,440
- How are you?
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

1663
02:07:35,490 --> 02:07:37,700
Good to have you back.

1664
02:07:37,740 --> 02:07:40,120
Come on. Home.

1665
02:07:42,910 --> 02:07:45,000
There she is.

1666
02:07:46,410 --> 02:07:50,170
- Hi.
- Hello.

1667
02:07:50,210 --> 02:07:54,260
- Aw, he should have kissed her.
- No, that's cool.

1668
02:07:56,260 --> 02:07:59,800
- All right?
- Hey. What are you two doing here?

1669
02:07:59,840 --> 02:08:02,390
- I might get a shag at last.
- Naughty.

1670
02:08:02,430 --> 02:08:05,890
- Got to go.
- Bye.

1671
02:08:05,930 --> 02:08:07,890
Yahoo!

1672
02:08:10,980 --> 02:08:13,440
Now, this is Harriet.

1673
02:08:14,530 --> 02:08:19,240
- Hi. Really pleased to meet you.
- Hello, Harriet.

1674
02:08:19,280 --> 02:08:23,200
I hope you don't mind,
I sort of brought my sister to stay.

1675
02:08:24,910 --> 02:08:29,370
This is Carla. She's real friendly.

1676
02:08:29,420 --> 02:08:31,750
Hello, you must be Tony.

1677
02:08:33,590 --> 02:08:35,710
I heard you were gorgeous.

1678
02:08:35,760 --> 02:08:38,590
God only knows
what I'd be without you...

1679
02:08:40,590 --> 02:08:44,260
God only knows what I'd be without you

1680
02:08:44,350 --> 02:08:47,930
God only knows
what I'd be without you...

1681
02:08:47,980 --> 02:08:50,440
- God, you weigh a lot.
- Oh, shut your face.

1682
02:08:51,690 --> 02:08:55,730
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows

1683
02:08:55,780 --> 02:08:59,700
God only knows what I'd be without you

1684
02:08:59,780 --> 02:09:03,620
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows

1685
02:09:03,660 --> 02:09:07,580
God only knows what I'd be without you

1686
02:09:07,620 --> 02:09:11,790
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows

1687
02:09:11,830 --> 02:09:15,380
God only knows what I'd be without you

1688
02:09:15,420 --> 02:09:19,590
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows

1689
02:09:19,630 --> 02:09:23,510
God only knows what I'd be without you

1690
02:09:23,550 --> 02:09:27,470
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows

1691
02:09:27,520 --> 02:09:31,600
God only knows what I'd be without you

1692
02:09:31,650 --> 02:09:35,440
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows

1693
02:09:35,480 --> 02:09:39,610
God only knows what I'd be without you

1694
02:09:39,650 --> 02:09:43,320
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows

1695
02:09:43,370 --> 02:09:47,290
God only knows what I'd be without you

1696
02:09:47,330 --> 02:09:51,210
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows

1697
02:09:51,250 --> 02:09:56,380
God only knows what I'd be without you

1698
02:10:15,270 --> 02:10:18,820
Love can be a many splendored thing

1699
02:10:18,860 --> 02:10:22,990
Can't deny the joy it brings

1700
02:10:23,030 --> 02:10:26,450
A dozen roses, diamond rings

1701
02:10:26,490 --> 02:10:30,660
Dreams for sale and fairy tales

1702
02:10:30,700 --> 02:10:34,420
It'll make you hear a symphony

1703
02:10:34,460 --> 02:10:38,300
And you just want the world to see

1704
02:10:38,340 --> 02:10:42,010
But like a drug that makes you blind

1705
02:10:42,050 --> 02:10:44,340
It'll fool ya every time

1706
02:10:44,380 --> 02:10:47,890
The trouble with love is

1707
02:10:49,100 --> 02:10:53,230
It can tear you up inside

1708
02:10:53,270 --> 02:10:57,190
Make your heart believe a lie

1709
02:10:57,230 --> 02:11:00,230
It's stronger than your pride

1710
02:11:00,280 --> 02:11:04,570
The trouble with love is

1711
02:11:04,610 --> 02:11:08,870
It doesn't care how fast you fall

1712
02:11:08,910 --> 02:11:12,620
And you can't refuse the call

1713
02:11:12,660 --> 02:11:15,750
See you got no say at all

1714
02:11:17,750 --> 02:11:21,460
Now I was once a fool, it's true

1715
02:11:21,500 --> 02:11:25,550
I played the game by all the rules

1716
02:11:25,590 --> 02:11:28,930
But now my world's a deeper blue

1717
02:11:28,970 --> 02:11:32,350
I'm sadder but I'm wiser too

1718
02:11:33,270 --> 02:11:36,440
I swore I'd never love again

1719
02:11:37,230 --> 02:11:40,730
I swore my heart would never mend

1720
02:11:41,320 --> 02:11:44,690
Said love wasn't worth the pain

1721
02:11:44,740 --> 02:11:47,410
But then I hear it call my name

1722
02:11:47,450 --> 02:11:51,790
The trouble with love is

1723
02:11:51,870 --> 02:11:55,870
It can tear you up inside

1724
02:11:55,910 --> 02:11:59,710
Make your heart believe a lie

1725
02:11:59,750 --> 02:12:02,920
It's stronger than your pride

1726
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:07,430
The trouble with love is

1727
02:12:07,470 --> 02:12:11,680
It doesn't care how fast you fall

1728
02:12:11,720 --> 02:12:15,270
And you can't refuse the call

1729
02:12:15,350 --> 02:12:18,350
See you got no say at all

1730
02:12:21,020 --> 02:12:23,820
Every time I turn around

1731
02:12:23,860 --> 02:12:27,490
I think I've got it all figured out

1732
02:12:27,570 --> 02:12:31,490
My heart keeps calling
And I keep on falling

1733
02:12:31,570 --> 02:12:35,950
Over and over again

1734
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:40,040
The sad story always ends the same

1735
02:12:40,080 --> 02:12:42,920
Me standing in the pouring rain

1736
02:12:43,880 --> 02:12:46,880
It seems no matter what I do

1737
02:12:46,920 --> 02:12:49,760
It tears my heart in two

1738
02:12:49,840 --> 02:12:54,850
The trouble with love is
The trouble with love

1739
02:12:54,930 --> 02:12:58,600
It can tear you up inside
It can tear you up inside

1740
02:12:58,640 --> 02:13:03,190
Make your heart believe a lie
Make your heart believe a lie

1741
02:13:03,230 --> 02:13:05,570
It's stronger than your pride

1742
02:13:05,610 --> 02:13:10,570
The trouble with love is
It's in your heart, it's in your soul

1743
02:13:10,610 --> 02:13:13,950
It doesn't care how fast you fall
You're losing that control

1744
02:13:13,990 --> 02:13:18,000
And you can't refuse the call

1745
02:13:18,040 --> 02:13:21,080
See you got no say at all

1746
02:13:21,120 --> 02:13:26,050
The trouble with love is
Ooh, yeah

1747
02:13:26,090 --> 02:13:30,300
It can tear you up inside
Ooh

1748
02:13:37,470 --> 02:13:42,980
Your eyes tell me how you want me

1749
02:13:43,020 --> 02:13:46,480
I can feel it in your heartbeat

1750
02:13:46,520 --> 02:13:50,240
You're so excited
I can feel you getting hotter

1751
02:13:50,280 --> 02:13:52,070
Oh baby

1752
02:13:52,110 --> 02:13:56,790
I'll take you down, I'll take you down

1753
02:13:56,830 --> 02:13:59,290
Where no one's ever gone before

1754
02:13:59,330 --> 02:14:01,250
And if you want more

1755
02:14:01,290 --> 02:14:05,420
If you want more, more, more

1756
02:14:05,460 --> 02:14:09,090
Then jump for my love

1757
02:14:09,130 --> 02:14:10,920
Jump in

1758
02:14:10,970 --> 02:14:12,930
And feel my touch

1759
02:14:12,970 --> 02:14:16,260
Jump
If you want to taste my kisses in the night

1760
02:14:16,300 --> 02:14:20,480
Then jump for my love

1761
02:14:20,560 --> 02:14:23,440
I know my heart
I know my heart can make you happy

1762
02:14:23,560 --> 02:14:27,150
Jump in
You know these arms can fill you up

1763
02:14:27,190 --> 02:14:30,650
Jump
If you want to taste my kisses in the night

1764
02:14:30,740 --> 02:14:34,410
Then jump for my love
