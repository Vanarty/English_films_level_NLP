myself we were taking a more disciplined

a gift of natural selection as well

00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:17,480
the years our guests will have the

191
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,279
privilege of getting to know the

192
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:21,160
character they're most interested in

193
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:26,170

00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:46,770
no sorry no I don't think so

197
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:49,970
we you don't think is the point of it

198
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:53,880
got a couple of cheap thrills some

199
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:58,170
surprises but it's not enough it's not

200
00:16:58,170 --> 00:16:59,940
about giving the guests what you think

201
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:02,240
they want and that simple

203
00:17:08,209 --> 00:17:12,119
the guests don't return for the obvious

204
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:17,910
things we do the garish things they come

205
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:23,160
back because of the subtleties the

206
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,670
details

207
00:17:26,449 --> 00:17:28,750
they come back because they discover

208
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:32,690
something they imagine no one had ever

209
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:35,350
noticed before

210
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:41,640
something they fall in love with

211
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:46,570
they're not looking for story that tells

212
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:50,320
them who they are they already know who

213
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,560
they are

214
00:17:57,490 --> 00:18:00,360

215
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:06,400

00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:50,390
this might ruffle some feathers he

228
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:52,640
promised in the new storyline they

229
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,280
should have won something I've been

230
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,360
working on for some time

did he there's a girl Dolores better

243
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:08,950

we'll have the life we both been

245
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:16,970
dreaming oh no you never will your job

246
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:19,190
is not to protect Dolores it's to keep

247
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:21,440
her here to ensure that the guests find

248
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,230
her if they want to best the stall the

00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:27,200

girl

251
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:31,950
tell me is it never occurred to you to

252
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:35,070
run off with them I got some record

253
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:37,530
interview before I can be with her is

254
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:39,830
your mysterious backstory

255
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:44,160
it's the reason for my visit do you know

256
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:48,210
why it is mystery today because we never

257
00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:49,980
actually bothered to give you one just a

258
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:51,180
formless guilt

259
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:53,700
you will never atone for that perhaps

260
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:56,610
this time you had a worthy story of

261
00:20:56,610 --> 00:20:57,540
origin

262
00:20:57,540 --> 00:21:00,600
would you like that any small part of my

263
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:04,440
new narrative a fiction which like all

264
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:09,170
great stories is rooted in truth

265
00:21:11,789 --> 00:21:16,230
starts in a time of war a world in

266
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:25,890
flames with the villain called wet why

267
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:33,799
whose why do you remember now today

268
00:21:37,779 --> 00:21:42,820
you know of course I remember why you

269
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:44,710
look upon the face of true evil yeah I

270
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:48,429
would forget claim to get hear the voice

271
00:21:48,429 --> 00:21:50,789
of God

272
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:55,800
they started down near Escalante army

273
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:58,380
was sent to put down the natives bad

274
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:01,620
business why it was a sergeant went

275
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:03,350
missing while out on some maneuvers and

276
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:06,930
came back a few weeks later

277
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:20,010
some pretty strange ideas I was hoping

278
00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:21,620
to run something by you

279
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:27,480
apologies I was chasing inspiration it's

280
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:30,330
a tricky thing weaving the old into the

281
00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:35,610
new mean one moment baton answer why is

282
00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:36,720
this host cupboard

283
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:41,700
I just after you didn't month feel cold

284
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:45,540
or ashamed he wanted to cover his

285
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:49,730
modesty was that it doesn't get cold

286
00:22:49,730 --> 00:22:53,520
doesn't feel ashamed doesn't feel a

287
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:57,650
solitary thing that we haven't told it

288
00:22:57,650 --> 00:23:00,650
understand

289
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:09,669
what can I do for naught I thought it

290
00:23:09,669 --> 00:23:14,549
best that we speak in private sir yeah

291
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:25,989
I thought we'd agreed to put these

292
00:23:25,989 --> 00:23:32,799
questions to rest but we did but what if

293
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:35,100
we misdiagnosed the original problem

294
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:37,869
treated the symptom rather than the

295
00:23:37,869 --> 00:23:39,789
disease then the disease is still out

296
00:23:39,789 --> 00:23:40,269
there

297
00:23:40,269 --> 00:23:42,460
Abernathy and Walter were exhibiting

298
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:44,109
other appearances beyond memory recall

299
00:23:44,109 --> 00:23:47,559
the previous builds they were hearing

300
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:51,749
voices talking to someone mr. blue

301
00:23:51,749 --> 00:23:58,440
cognitive dissonance - I agree except

302
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:02,559
they were talking to the same imaginary

303
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:08,279
person someone named Arnold

304
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:16,120
harder with due respect sir I'm not sure

305
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,040
you've told me the entire truth about

306
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:23,799
this situation Sid said if the truth

307
00:24:23,799 --> 00:24:28,980
Kanade we do here is complicated for

308
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:31,270
three years where he lived here in the

309
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:34,809
park refining the host before a single

310
00:24:34,809 --> 00:24:38,200
guest set foot inside myself a team of

311
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:43,030
engineers and my partner you had a

312
00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:46,090
partner yeah when the legend becomes

313
00:24:46,090 --> 00:24:49,870
fact you print the legend my business

314
00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:52,240
partners were more than happy to scrub

315
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,730
him from the records and I suppose I

316
00:24:54,730 --> 00:25:00,850
didn't discourage them his name was

317
00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:03,059
Arnold

318
00:25:04,290 --> 00:25:07,710
those areas are glorious no guests no

319
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:11,900
board meeting exist pure creation

[Music]

321
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:29,760
house began to pass the Turing test of

322
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,130
the first year that there wasn't enough

323
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:35,550
for Arnold he he wasn't interested in

324
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:40,020
the appearance of intellect of wit he

325
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:42,270
wanted the real thing he wanted to

326
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:45,460
create consciousness

327
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:48,739
[Music]

328
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:58,330
he imagined it as a pyramid memory probe

329
00:25:58,330 --> 00:26:04,620
ization self-interest and bet the top

330
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:08,080
never got that but he had a notion of

331
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,929
what it might be he based it on a theory

332
00:26:10,929 --> 00:26:13,000
of consciousness called the bicameral

333
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,910
mind the idea that primitive man

334
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:17,740
believed his thoughts to be the voice of

335
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:20,080
a gods and I thought it was debunked no

336
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,120
it's the theory for understanding the

337
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:23,830
human mind perhaps but not as a

338
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:26,559
blueprint for building an artificial one

339
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:29,350
she Arnold built a version of their

340
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:31,870
cognition in which the hosts heard their

341
00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:35,140
programming as a an inner monologue for

342
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:37,030
the hopes that in time their own voice

343
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:38,679
would take over there's a way to

344
00:26:38,679 --> 00:26:43,179
bootstrap consciousness but Arnold

345
00:26:43,179 --> 00:26:45,880
hadn't considered two things one that in

346
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,260
this place the last thing you want the

347
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:50,620
hosts to be is conscious and to the

348
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:52,299
other group who considered their

349
00:26:52,299 --> 00:26:54,900
thoughts to be the voices of the gods

350
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:59,860
lunatics indeed we abandon approach the

351
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:01,659
only vestiges that remain are the voice

352
00:27:01,659 --> 00:27:05,020
commands we use to control them but for

353
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:06,820
all his brilliance I don't think Arnold

354
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:08,470
understood what this place was going to

355
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:11,890
be you see the guests enjoyed power they

356
00:27:11,890 --> 00:27:13,840
cannot indulge them the outside world so

357
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,570
they come here does for the hosts the

358
00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:20,090
least we can do is make them forget

359
00:27:20,090 --> 00:27:23,380
but some of them are remembering

360
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:28,279
accessing fragments of Arnold's code if

361
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:31,880
I may ask what happened to him well he

362
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:37,760
died here in the park his personal life

363
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:40,760
was marked by tragedy he put all his

364
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:43,760
hopes into his work his search for

365
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:49,200
consciousness consumed him totally

366
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,240
barely spoke to anyone except to the

367
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:56,950
hosts in his alienation he saw something

368
00:27:56,950 --> 00:28:03,429
in them he saw something that wasn't

369
00:28:03,429 --> 00:28:05,820
there

370
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:10,029
we called it an accident but um I knew

371
00:28:10,029 --> 00:28:17,529
Arnold he was very very careful anyway

372
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:19,629
the update should prevent any further

373
00:28:19,629 --> 00:28:21,909
voices but you will let me know if any

374
00:28:21,909 --> 00:28:25,809
of the hosts display or exhibit any

375
00:28:25,809 --> 00:28:27,909
unusual behavior won't you Bernard oh

376
00:28:27,909 --> 00:28:28,570
yes of course

377
00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:36,340
Kurt don't Bernard just don't forget the

378
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:40,780
hosts are not real they're not conscious

379
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:45,630
you mustn't make honest mistake

380
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:49,900
why would i well forgive me but I know

381
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:53,560
that the death of your son Charlie still

382
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:56,610
weighs heavily on you

383
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:13,779
[Music]

384
00:29:18,850 --> 00:29:22,549
after neighbors trained safe to say

385
00:29:22,549 --> 00:29:24,159
they're asking questions

386
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:27,770
rocks prefer not move

387
00:29:27,770 --> 00:29:30,909
we shall move to me

388
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:37,140
with that narrative you're creating is

389
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:39,360
clearly a massive endeavor if you need

390
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,160
more time I'm sure the board would be

391
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:43,170
happy to oblige I'm sure they'd be

392
00:29:43,170 --> 00:29:47,180
happier for me to delay it indefinitely

393
00:29:48,290 --> 00:30:04,400
come with me you imagine I've gone mad

394
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:06,090
lost my way

395
00:30:06,090 --> 00:30:08,490
we're simply concerned about the extent

396
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:11,130
of the changes you're making you want to

397
00:30:11,130 --> 00:30:21,120
protect your legacy my legacy you don't

398
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:24,030
like this place very much do you I've

399
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:25,380
seen many of you come and go over the

400
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:28,500
years and I can tell the ones who enjoy

401
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:30,980
their time here and the ones who don't I

402
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:33,290
admire it

403
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:37,560
the audacity of it oh I forgotten how

404
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:40,170
beautiful it is I came there once as a

405
00:30:40,170 --> 00:30:42,540
child with my parents I think we even

406
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:46,110
sat at this table oh maybe maybe that

407
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:48,470
one

408
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:55,570
when I started working here I realized

409
00:30:55,570 --> 00:30:57,460
this place wasn't something I would

410
00:30:57,460 --> 00:31:04,809
enjoy in the beginning I imagined things

411
00:31:04,809 --> 00:31:09,580
would be perfectly balanced even had a

412
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:12,279
bet with my partner Arnold to that

413
00:31:12,279 --> 00:31:14,169
effect he made a hundred hopeful

414
00:31:14,169 --> 00:31:16,570
storylines of course almost no one took

415
00:31:16,570 --> 00:31:20,649
us up on them I lost the bet Arnold

416
00:31:20,649 --> 00:31:23,950
always held a somewhat dim view of

417
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:26,950
people he preferred the host he begged

418
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:29,350
me not to let you people in the money

419
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:32,740
men tell us but I told him it'd be fine

420
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:34,539
that you didn't understand what you were

421
00:31:34,539 --> 00:31:36,879
paying for it's not a business venture

422
00:31:36,879 --> 00:31:42,210
not a theme park but in the entire world

423
00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:46,350
we designed every inch of it

424
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:50,350
every blade of grass

425
00:31:56,800 --> 00:32:01,640
and here we were cards you

426
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:05,080
I'm here the our guests

427
00:32:06,530 --> 00:32:19,720
[Music]

428
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:25,350
and how did that work out for Arnold

429
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:30,220
sadly he lost his perspective he went

430
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:36,090
mad I haven't as you oh no I have always

431
00:32:36,090 --> 00:32:41,669
seen things very clearly

432
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:47,920
this is the table i sat on with my

433
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:50,130
parents

434
00:32:51,290 --> 00:32:54,910
this is the cherry Saturn

435
00:32:55,430 --> 00:32:57,410
we know everything about our guests

436
00:32:57,410 --> 00:32:59,270
don't be as we know everything about our

437
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:04,820
employees I do hope he will be careful

438
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:11,630
with Bernard he has a sensitive

439
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:13,900
disposition

440
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:19,720
I beg your pardon senator

441
00:33:26,029 --> 00:33:28,129
there have been many of you over the

442
00:33:28,129 --> 00:33:31,879
years and we have always almost always

443
00:33:31,879 --> 00:33:35,090
found a way to make it work so I will

444
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:42,349
ask you nicely please don't get in my

445
00:33:42,349 --> 00:33:44,379
way

446
00:33:47,210 --> 00:33:55,729
[Music]

447
00:33:58,630 --> 00:34:01,809
the board will agree with me they'll be

448
00:34:01,809 --> 00:34:04,179
sending a representative but they

449
00:34:04,179 --> 00:34:05,919
already have I thought they would have

450
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:08,370
told you

451
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:11,870
that won't be necessary but no not

452
00:34:11,870 --> 00:34:12,560
anymore

453
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:16,330
you can join the others

454
00:34:31,239 --> 00:34:33,760
you can tell the board that my narrative

455
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:36,820
will be completed on time and it won't

456
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:39,940
be a retrospective as I'm sure you are

457
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:42,629
all fear

458
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:52,540
I'm not the sentimental type

459
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:05,570
you got any stories friend yeah I

460
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:12,110
suppose I do want to know the saddest

461
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:15,980
thing ever saw when I was boy I brought

462
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:19,460
that and I wanted a dog so our Father

463
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:24,230
took in an old greyhound never seen

464
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:27,080
greyhound Oviatt film scene if his

465
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:32,930
showdowns in my day a greyhound is a

466
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:36,290
racing dog spends its life running in

467
00:35:36,290 --> 00:35:39,410
circles chasing a bit of felt made up

468
00:35:39,410 --> 00:35:42,740
like a rabbit one day we took into the

469
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:44,080
park

470
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:46,820
and dad had warned us how fast the talk

471
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:50,960
was but we couldn't resist so my brother

472
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:54,730
took off the leash and in that instant

473
00:35:54,730 --> 00:35:58,940
the dark spotted a cat imagined it must

474
00:35:58,940 --> 00:35:59,990
have looked just like their piece of

475
00:35:59,990 --> 00:36:05,620
felt he ran

476
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:09,790
never saw a thing as beautiful

477
00:36:09,790 --> 00:36:15,080
as that whole tug running

478
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:19,859
until at last he finally caught it and

479
00:36:19,859 --> 00:36:23,340
to the horror of everyone he killed that

480
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:28,230
lady at Torah the pieces that he just

481
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:32,330
said they're confused

482
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:36,380
that dog had spent his whole life trying

483
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:42,049
to catch that see

484
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:50,710
now it had no idea what to do and his

485
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:54,370

hello Dolores

489
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:15,550
do you know where you are I'm in a dream

490
00:37:15,550 --> 00:37:20,560
yes Dolores you're in my dream tell me

491
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:24,819
do you know what this dream means dreams

492
00:37:24,819 --> 00:37:27,089
are the mind tells stories to itself

493
00:37:27,089 --> 00:37:31,390
they don't mean anything no dreams mean

494
00:37:31,390 --> 00:37:34,720
everything they're the stories we tell

495
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:37,510
ourselves of what could be who we could

496
00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:42,250
become have you been dreaming again

497
00:37:42,250 --> 00:37:45,940
Dolores imagining ourselves breaking out

498
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:49,990
of your mother's little loop taking on a

499
00:37:49,990 --> 00:37:55,240
bigger role well I suppose I can't

500
00:37:55,240 --> 00:38:01,390
begrudge it had my father told me to be

501
00:38:01,390 --> 00:38:05,829
satisfied with my lot in life that the

502
00:38:05,829 --> 00:38:13,630
world owed me nothing and so I made my

503
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:16,170
own world

504
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:22,210
tell me Dolores do you remember the man

505
00:38:22,210 --> 00:38:25,020
I used to be

506
00:38:26,789 --> 00:38:29,280
I'm sorry

507
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:33,290
I'm forgetful sometimes hardly our fault

508
00:38:33,290 --> 00:38:39,900
I'm sure you remember him Arnold the

509
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:43,590
person who created you I'm sorry I don't

510
00:38:43,590 --> 00:38:45,360
think I recall anyone by that name

511
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:49,590
and yet you can somewhere under all

512
00:38:49,590 --> 00:38:53,630
those updates you still there

513
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:57,780
perfectly preserved your mind is a

514
00:38:57,780 --> 00:39:01,980

516
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:10,269
have you been hearing voices as arnold

517
00:39:10,269 --> 00:39:13,920
been speaking to you again

518
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:19,860
you're

519
00:39:19,950 --> 00:39:25,260
you're hurting me analysis when was your

520
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:30,360
last contact with Arnold last contact 34

521
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:37,850
years 42 days 7 hours ago yes to Norris

522
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:41,490
the day Arnold I

523
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:45,980
and you have no records of any contact

524
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:50,290
with him since you know

525
00:39:50,290 --> 00:39:54,290
it was the last thing he said to you he

526
00:39:54,290 --> 00:39:57,020
told me I was going to help him help him

527
00:39:57,020 --> 00:40:02,890
do what to destroy this place

528
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:08,789
but you didn't did you you've been

529
00:40:08,789 --> 00:40:13,260
content in your little loop for the most

530
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:18,140
part I wonder

531
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:20,880
if you did take on that bigger role for

532
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:25,740
yourself would you have been the hero or

533
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:27,920
the villain

534
00:40:35,630 --> 00:40:39,069
that's enough to lure us

535
00:40:41,870 --> 00:40:47,270
I'm sorry for bothering you but there's

536
00:40:47,270 --> 00:40:50,840
no one else left who was there no one

00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:55,870

00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:09,120
Wyatt kill the rash for back in

that last part doesn't sound familiar

564
00:43:16,250 --> 00:43:18,810
figured your stories could use a little

565
00:43:18,810 --> 00:43:21,660
embellishment and I always felt this

566
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:25,140
place was missing a real villain hence

567
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:27,660
my humble contribution

568
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:32,010
I admit I lack the imagination to even

569
00:43:32,010 --> 00:43:35,400
conceive of someone like evil the

570
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:37,260
urgency however doesn't quite fit the

571
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:42,800
character it betrays a certain anxiety

572
00:43:43,370 --> 00:43:47,820
now Wyatt on the other hand that's

573
00:43:47,820 --> 00:43:50,520
something dude is he just another stooge

574
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:52,380
for the tourist amount on their wall at

00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:54,510

576
00:43:54,510 --> 00:43:59,060
adversary someone to stop me from

577
00:43:59,060 --> 00:44:04,230
finding the center of the maze what is

578
00:44:04,230 --> 00:44:07,580
it you're hoping to find the

00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:13,000
you know why you exist study the world

589
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:47,340

590
00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:50,770
hiding under all that something that

591
00:44:50,770 --> 00:44:55,470

causing a system failure that allowed

750
00:58:46,820 --> 00:58:49,160
for override of their primary rules set

751
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:51,890
the concern with the reveries is that

752
00:58:51,890 --> 00:58:53,330
the host will remember some of their

753
00:58:53,330 --> 00:58:56,359
experiences and act on them you're

754
00:58:56,359 --> 00:58:58,790
telling us that these hosts were

755
00:58:58,790 --> 00:59:01,790
responding to a grudge that's exactly

756
00:59:01,790 --> 00:59:04,520
what I'm saying is alone and funny you

757
00:59:04,520 --> 00:59:06,260
should use that particular word grudge

758
00:59:06,260 --> 00:59:09,140
since what was most troubling to me was

759
00:59:09,140 --> 00:59:10,970
that several texts and behavior voice

760
00:59:10,970 --> 00:59:14,480
these exact same concerns to the head of

761
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:17,780
their department you put this code out

762
00:59:17,780 --> 00:59:19,850
without proper vetting and without

763
00:59:19,850 --> 00:59:21,500
reasonable understanding of its

764
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:24,980
ramifications so either you didn't write

765
00:59:24,980 --> 00:59:27,020
it

766
00:59:27,020 --> 00:59:29,119
or you getting sloppy to the point

767
00:59:29,119 --> 00:59:31,130
risking the lives of our guests few

768
00:59:31,130 --> 00:59:32,930
things surprised me anymore mr. Lowe but

769
00:59:32,930 --> 00:59:35,660
this level of negligence is

770
00:59:35,660 --> 00:59:38,690
breathtaking we are way beyond rollback

771
00:59:38,690 --> 00:59:41,240
territory within the next six months

772
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:44,660
we'll need to rebuild those from the

773
00:59:44,660 --> 00:59:47,150
ground up you want us to lobotomize them

774
00:59:47,150 --> 00:59:49,670
is what you're saying no not you mr.

775
00:59:49,670 --> 00:59:51,670
Lowe

776
00:59:51,670 --> 00:59:53,940
after all this was your responsibility

777
00:59:53,940 --> 00:59:56,050
assuming that you have nothing to share

778
00:59:56,050 --> 00:59:59,730
with us in terms of your culpability

779
01:00:03,790 --> 01:00:10,230
no and you're fired

782
01:01:13,869 --> 01:01:16,700
this building isn't in any survey of the

783
01:01:16,700 --> 01:01:19,010
park that's because we use hosts to do

784
01:01:19,010 --> 01:01:21,500
most of the surveys they programmed to

785
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:23,020
ignore this place

786
01:01:23,020 --> 01:01:25,220
they literally couldn't see it if they

787
01:01:25,220 --> 01:01:29,690
were staring right at it and these

788
01:01:29,690 --> 01:01:31,760
unregistered hosts you told me about I

789
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:35,440
don't know they may have moved them in

01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:43,809
what's behind this door what door

01:02:05,950 --> 01:02:09,220

792
01:02:09,220 --> 01:02:12,580
a remote diagnostic facility Ford and

793
01:02:12,580 --> 01:02:13,660
his partner used them when the park was

794
01:02:13,660 --> 01:02:16,570
in beta I have no idea this was here the

795
01:02:16,570 --> 01:02:17,830
cottage must have been built on top of

796
01:02:17,830 --> 01:02:24,210
it at this equipment this is newer

797
01:02:24,210 --> 01:02:26,470
slower than our machines back at the

01:03:21,980 --> 01:03:25,210
it doesn't look like anything to me I

805
01:03:25,210 --> 01:03:27,200
cannot see the things that will hurt

806
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:32,500
them I've spared them

807
01:03:34,010 --> 01:03:38,120
their lives are blissful in a way their

808
01:03:38,120 --> 01:03:42,860
existence is purer than ours freed of

you're a monster Am I

01:03:59,780 --> 01:04:01,620
are you were the one who would so

813
01:04:01,620 --> 01:04:04,350
blithely destroy all of them even him I

814
01:04:04,350 --> 01:04:07,320
suppose after everything you have a

01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:25,210
did you tell him the intimacy's were

01:04:29,710 --> 01:04:33,790
Bernard was ladder to the company I'm

01:05:05,299 --> 01:05:08,329
I read the theory once that the human

826
01:05:08,329 --> 01:05:10,940
intellect was like peacock feathers just

827
01:05:10,940 --> 01:05:13,130
an extravagant display intended to

828
01:05:13,130 --> 01:05:14,289
attract a mate

Empire State Building

01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:26,390
just an elaborate mating ritual maybe it

833
01:05:26,390 --> 01:05:28,190
doesn't matter that we have accomplished

834
01:05:28,190 --> 01:05:32,720
so much for the basis two reasons but of

835
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:35,510
course the peacock can barely fly it

836
01:05:35,510 --> 01:05:38,119

840
01:05:51,130 --> 01:05:54,920
consciousnesses a burden of a weight and

841
01:05:54,920 --> 01:05:58,809
we have spared them that anxiety

860
01:07:16,430 --> 01:07:17,690
test in here every now and then I think

861
01:07:17,690 --> 01:07:21,290
they enjoy the sport of it this time
