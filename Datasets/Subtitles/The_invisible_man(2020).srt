1
00:02:56,135 --> 00:02:57,218
Adrian?

2
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:03,780
Come on.

3
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:50,803
<i>Zeus, I'm sorry.
I can't take you with me.</i>

4
00:07:52,556 --> 00:07:53,973
I'm sorry.

5
00:07:57,144 --> 00:08:01,105
<i>Shit. I'm not gonna leave you
with that thing on. Okay.</i>

6
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:03,608
<i>Come here. It's okay.
Good boy.</i>

7
00:08:03,692 --> 00:08:04,859
Come here.
There you go.

8
00:08:06,612 --> 00:08:07,612
Come here.

9
00:09:00,499 --> 00:09:01,791
Fuck!

10
00:09:02,626 --> 00:09:05,169
Emily, where are you?

11
00:09:07,381 --> 00:09:08,631
Shit.

12
00:09:57,723 --> 00:09:59,724
Cecilia,
what is going on?

13
00:10:00,225 --> 00:10:01,267
Are you okay?

14
00:10:02,436 --> 00:10:03,478
I'll explain later.

15
00:10:04,062 --> 00:10:05,104
Just go, Emily.

16
00:10:05,189 --> 00:10:06,230
Go!

17
00:10:07,566 --> 00:10:10,151
Open the fucking door,
Cecilia! What is happening?

18
00:10:10,235 --> 00:10:11,569
<i>- Open the door!
- No!</i>

19
00:10:11,653 --> 00:10:13,362
<i>Open the fucking door!</i>

20
00:10:14,156 --> 00:10:15,656
Open the door!

21
00:10:15,741 --> 00:10:17,950
<i>- Open the fucking door!
- I'm going! I'm going!</i>

22
00:10:18,035 --> 00:10:19,744
Cecilia! Get back here!

23
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:21,162
Jesus!

24
00:10:22,998 --> 00:10:26,209
<i>Get back here now! You
can't do this! Get back here!</i>

25
00:11:22,641 --> 00:11:23,683
Cee.

26
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:27,854
How long have you been up?

27
00:11:27,938 --> 00:11:31,148
Few hours.
Can't sleep.

28
00:11:31,233 --> 00:11:34,944
Cee, you know, if you close your eyes
and you lie down, that usually helps.

29
00:11:38,699 --> 00:11:42,076
Um, don't think being tired gets
you out of our little deal, now.

30
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:46,289
I swore to your sister I'd get
you to step outside my house.

31
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:49,000
Hey, Cee.

32
00:11:50,711 --> 00:11:52,169
He's not out there.

33
00:11:52,796 --> 00:11:54,130
I promise.

34
00:12:47,851 --> 00:12:48,935
I'm sorry, I'm just...

35
00:12:52,397 --> 00:12:53,439
I'm not ready yet.

36
00:12:53,523 --> 00:12:54,774
Hey, it's okay, Cee.

37
00:12:54,858 --> 00:12:58,110
That's the furthest you've gone
since you've been here. Okay?

38
00:12:58,195 --> 00:13:00,488
So as far as I'm concerned,
you just walked on the moon.

39
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:15,836
I can't work
with this damn thing.

40
00:13:40,779 --> 00:13:42,947
It's all right.
I got it.

41
00:13:45,492 --> 00:13:46,742
I got it.

42
00:13:54,251 --> 00:13:56,836
<i>Do I know you?
Do I owe you money?</i>

43
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,087
A lot.
A lot?

44
00:13:58,171 --> 00:14:00,673
I told y'all about running
up on me in my house.

45
00:14:02,592 --> 00:14:05,636
<i>Hey. Cee, tell her
she can't take you back.</i>

46
00:14:05,721 --> 00:14:06,846
We're keeping you.

47
00:14:07,431 --> 00:14:09,306
What are you doing here, Emily?

48
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,019
Well, it's nice
to see you too, sis.

49
00:14:13,395 --> 00:14:15,646
I'm gonna go
see what Sydney's up to.

50
00:14:16,023 --> 00:14:18,733
Just... Yeah.
Mmm.

51
00:14:19,693 --> 00:14:21,027
This is not fair.

52
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:24,030
I asked you not to come over.

53
00:14:24,114 --> 00:14:26,282
<i>He knows where you live.
He will follow you.</i>

54
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:27,491
Yes.

55
00:14:27,576 --> 00:14:29,493
Well, I have some news...

56
00:14:29,578 --> 00:14:31,245
There is no news
that justifies this.

57
00:14:31,329 --> 00:14:33,706
<i>Okay. I have a plan,
and I just...</i>

58
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:36,042
I need you to go along with it.

59
00:14:36,251 --> 00:14:38,252
And just not be in control
for one second.

60
00:14:38,336 --> 00:14:40,713
I'm not trying
to control you, boo.

61
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:45,176
I'm desperately trying to tell you that
you don't need to cut me off anymore.

62
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,388
Because he's dead.

63
00:14:52,893 --> 00:14:53,893
What?

64
00:15:05,572 --> 00:15:06,614
What?

65
00:15:22,881 --> 00:15:23,923
Hey.

66
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:27,468
What did he do to you?

67
00:15:28,136 --> 00:15:30,054
Can you talk to me?

68
00:16:09,886 --> 00:16:12,680
It just doesn't make any sense.

69
00:16:14,141 --> 00:16:18,602
<i>He was... He was in complete
control of everything, you know?</i>

70
00:16:20,772 --> 00:16:21,897
Including me.

71
00:16:22,691 --> 00:16:27,653
He controlled how I looked
and what I wore

72
00:16:28,155 --> 00:16:29,738
and what I ate.

73
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:39,874
And then it was controlling
when I left the house

74
00:16:42,627 --> 00:16:44,128
and what I said.

75
00:16:44,671 --> 00:16:46,172
And eventually,

76
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,215
what I thought.

77
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:53,679
And if...

78
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:58,893
If he didn't like what he
assumed I was thinking...

79
00:17:01,855 --> 00:17:02,938
He...

80
00:17:03,732 --> 00:17:05,774
<i>- He would...
- He'd what?</i>

81
00:17:06,818 --> 00:17:08,444
<i>He would...
He would hit you?</i>

82
00:17:10,614 --> 00:17:12,406
Amongst other things.

83
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:15,910
He wanted to have a baby.

84
00:17:16,703 --> 00:17:18,787
And I knew that if we did that,

85
00:17:19,956 --> 00:17:22,499
that I would never be
able to get away from him,

86
00:17:24,169 --> 00:17:27,546
so I took birth control
without him knowing it.

87
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:32,343
But, um, that can
only go on for so long,

88
00:17:35,847 --> 00:17:37,389
<i>so I called you.</i>

89
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:40,100
Hey.

90
00:17:44,189 --> 00:17:45,522
You're here with us now.

91
00:17:47,025 --> 00:17:48,525
And you're safe.

92
00:17:49,694 --> 00:17:50,945
He's gone.

93
00:18:18,723 --> 00:18:20,432
I'm not telling you to aim low.

94
00:18:20,517 --> 00:18:23,102
I'm just saying, explore
more than one option, okay?

95
00:18:23,186 --> 00:18:25,813
Don't limit your choices to just
one school in the whole country.

96
00:18:25,897 --> 00:18:29,817
But that one school is my
goal. Parsons is my goal.

97
00:18:29,901 --> 00:18:33,112
Yeah, I told you
to have goals. Plural.

98
00:18:35,907 --> 00:18:38,659
I think it's important
to have goals, James.

99
00:18:39,244 --> 00:18:40,327
Hey.

100
00:18:41,329 --> 00:18:44,415
Look at you,
getting out into the world.

101
00:18:44,499 --> 00:18:46,709
Yo, by next year, you'll
make it across the street.

102
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:51,005
Mmm.
Mmm-mmm.

103
00:18:51,298 --> 00:18:53,966
<i>Uh, hey, Cee.
Something came for you.</i>

104
00:18:57,178 --> 00:18:58,804
No one knows I'm here.

105
00:19:11,109 --> 00:19:13,527
So, who's it from?

106
00:19:29,252 --> 00:19:31,587
Thank you both for coming in.

107
00:19:32,964 --> 00:19:37,760
As the appointed attorney representing
my late brother's discretionary trust,

108
00:19:37,844 --> 00:19:41,013
I'm required to enact
his final wishes.

109
00:19:41,264 --> 00:19:43,599
And he stipulated
that I do this in person.

110
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:46,769
He wanted me to read
a prepared statement.

111
00:19:53,735 --> 00:19:54,943
"Cecilia,"

112
00:19:55,862 --> 00:19:58,864
"although our relationship
was far from perfect,"

113
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:01,075
"I at least thought
we had built up enough trust"

114
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:03,429
"that you would talk to me
rather than running away from..."

115
00:20:03,453 --> 00:20:04,578
No. No!

116
00:20:04,662 --> 00:20:06,102
Sorry, you're not allowed
to do that.

117
00:20:06,998 --> 00:20:08,123
I'm required to read this.

118
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:09,368
She's not required to listen.

119
00:20:09,417 --> 00:20:12,127
Email me a copy,
and we will read it.

120
00:20:12,212 --> 00:20:13,212
You bet.

121
00:20:13,296 --> 00:20:14,671
I'm just trying to do my job.

122
00:20:14,756 --> 00:20:16,901
Your job is to explain the
money you mentioned on the phone.

123
00:20:16,925 --> 00:20:20,135
I mentioned Cecilia, specifically,
is named in Adrian's trust.

124
00:20:20,261 --> 00:20:22,137
That is why we're sitting here. Yes.

125
00:20:22,222 --> 00:20:26,433
For the same reason so many women in
Adrian's life got close to him, his money.

126
00:20:26,518 --> 00:20:28,371
If there was a chance of
physically being close to him,

127
00:20:28,395 --> 00:20:30,396
we would not be here
for any amount of money.

128
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,064
You are physically close to him.

129
00:20:34,442 --> 00:20:35,984
He's in that urn over there.

130
00:20:39,531 --> 00:20:41,573
And as per his final wishes,

131
00:20:41,991 --> 00:20:44,076
you're getting $5 million,

132
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:47,579
estate and income tax free.

133
00:20:48,665 --> 00:20:51,959
Now, the money will be staggered
in installments of $100,000

134
00:20:52,043 --> 00:20:54,586
each month for the next
four years or so.

135
00:20:54,921 --> 00:20:57,131
Contingent, of course,
on the fine print.

136
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:59,341
You can't commit a crime,
etcetera.

137
00:20:59,426 --> 00:21:02,594
Normally, I would have a
120-day contestability period,

138
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:04,805
but I'm gonna waive my
rights in that regard.

139
00:21:04,889 --> 00:21:06,056
So,

140
00:21:06,808 --> 00:21:09,893
as soon as I have your signature
and your banking information,

141
00:21:11,396 --> 00:21:12,729
I can start releasing the funds.

142
00:21:23,533 --> 00:21:24,992
Okay,
you can come in now.

143
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,040
Oh.
Oh.

144
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:34,042
Hey. Wait. Where you at?

145
00:21:34,127 --> 00:21:35,377
Okay.
Okay.

146
00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:37,087
Can we look now?

147
00:21:37,755 --> 00:21:39,214
Yes, you can look.

148
00:21:40,341 --> 00:21:41,925
Ta-da!
Oh.

149
00:21:42,719 --> 00:21:44,428
Wow. Thanks, Cee.

150
00:21:44,512 --> 00:21:46,305
<i>Wow, that's nice.
Look at that.</i>

151
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:48,265
<i>A ladder?</i>

152
00:21:48,349 --> 00:21:49,391
Excuse you?

153
00:21:50,185 --> 00:21:51,810
I know I didn't
hear you just say that.

154
00:21:51,895 --> 00:21:53,854
I meant to say,
"Thank you." Uh-huh.

155
00:21:53,938 --> 00:21:54,938
You're welcome.

156
00:21:55,023 --> 00:21:58,984
Well, I knew you needed a new one,
and that one just... That has to go.

157
00:21:59,068 --> 00:22:01,069
<i>That's so nice of you, Cee.
Thank you so much.</i>

158
00:22:01,154 --> 00:22:02,946
<i>That's very sweet of you.
Thank you.</i>

159
00:22:03,239 --> 00:22:06,366
<i>I just... I wanted to thank you
for, you know, letting me stay here</i>

160
00:22:06,451 --> 00:22:09,536
and for taking such
good care of me, so...

161
00:22:09,621 --> 00:22:13,790
And Sydney can also use ladders.

162
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:15,792
Don't think
I'm helping you paint.

163
00:22:15,877 --> 00:22:17,544
I wouldn't even bother
to ask you.

164
00:22:18,087 --> 00:22:21,256
No, not for, like, painting,
obviously, but just for a lot of things.

165
00:22:21,341 --> 00:22:24,092
<i>You climb them to get things.
Like... Like, stuff like that.</i>

166
00:22:24,219 --> 00:22:25,404
<i>That's so strange.</i>

167
00:22:25,428 --> 00:22:26,906
God, I wish you had,
like... Oh, wait!

168
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:29,241
<i>You could totally use the ladder...
Yeah. A ladder to climb up.</i>

169
00:22:29,265 --> 00:22:30,390
The ladder's cool.

170
00:22:30,475 --> 00:22:32,976
This happened to just
pop up here by itself...

171
00:22:33,061 --> 00:22:34,520
<i>Convenient.</i>
Wow.

172
00:22:35,271 --> 00:22:36,271
What is it?

173
00:22:36,356 --> 00:22:37,458
<i>It has my name on it.
That's weird.</i>

174
00:22:37,482 --> 00:22:39,210
And it looks like your
handwriting. I don't...

175
00:22:39,234 --> 00:22:40,234
You sure it's weird?

176
00:22:40,318 --> 00:22:43,320
I just got a ladder, so I
don't know what...

177
00:22:43,404 --> 00:22:45,781
<i>Let's see.
A cool ladder is all.</i>

178
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:50,763
It's a new bank
account, um, with your name on it.

179
00:22:50,787 --> 00:22:55,916
And I'm gonna put $10,000 in it
every month for the rest of the year.

180
00:22:56,459 --> 00:22:58,877
I called the account
"Parsons."

181
00:23:04,384 --> 00:23:05,842
You're going to
fashion school, kid.

182
00:23:05,927 --> 00:23:06,927
Hey, whoa, Cee...

183
00:23:07,011 --> 00:23:10,514
<i>That's... That's too much, Cee. Come on.
Are you sure you can do that?</i>

184
00:23:10,598 --> 00:23:11,848
Let me put it this way...

185
00:23:12,225 --> 00:23:14,560
She can probably
go to grad school, too.

186
00:23:15,436 --> 00:23:17,521
<i>I'm going to Parsons.</i>

187
00:23:17,605 --> 00:23:20,148
<i>You're going to Parsons.
You're going to Parsons.</i>

188
00:23:20,275 --> 00:23:21,358
Oh, my God.

189
00:23:21,943 --> 00:23:22,943
Oh.

190
00:23:23,027 --> 00:23:25,696
<i>Wait, no. We gotta...
We gotta celebrate.</i>

191
00:23:25,822 --> 00:23:28,282
And I don't want TV dinners,
microwave nothing. Oh!

192
00:23:28,366 --> 00:23:32,452
<i>It's like, I guess... We don't have
anything at all to celebrate with.</i>

193
00:23:35,957 --> 00:23:37,165
I don't know why you dancing.

194
00:23:37,292 --> 00:23:39,186
You can't have none because
you're not 21. Yes, I can.

195
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:41,295
<i>Come on. Just, like,
a little bit.</i>

196
00:23:41,379 --> 00:23:44,172
He said the other day
that I was mature for my age.

197
00:23:44,257 --> 00:23:45,299
<i>That's right.
He did.</i>

198
00:23:45,383 --> 00:23:46,383
A mature child.

199
00:23:46,467 --> 00:23:47,653
<i>I heard you say that.
I remember.</i>

200
00:23:47,677 --> 00:23:49,386
<i>Hold up. This ain't fair.
Two against one.</i>

201
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:51,073
I'm just an innocent man trying
to do right.

202
00:23:51,097 --> 00:23:52,097
Are you scared?

203
00:23:52,181 --> 00:23:54,061
<i>This is abuse. I'm a cop.
You realize I'm a cop?</i>

204
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:55,684
I got him.
Hey!

205
00:23:55,977 --> 00:23:57,019
Oh, no.

206
00:23:57,937 --> 00:24:00,105
<i>I got him, Sydney!
I got him!</i>

207
00:24:04,444 --> 00:24:06,361
I'll protect you!

208
00:25:30,488 --> 00:25:33,281
<i>Morning.
You want some breakfast?</i>

209
00:25:33,658 --> 00:25:35,283
No. No, I gotta go.

210
00:25:35,993 --> 00:25:38,787
You know, I'm a little
hungover, believe it or not.

211
00:25:38,871 --> 00:25:40,831
Oh. Me too.

212
00:25:41,499 --> 00:25:43,500
Champagne does that
to me every time.

213
00:25:44,502 --> 00:25:47,045
We're getting old,
Cee. We old.

214
00:25:47,171 --> 00:25:49,011
These winter mornings
are killing me.

215
00:25:49,382 --> 00:25:52,801
<i>All right, look, I'm out of here.
Um, I'll be back around 7:00.</i>

216
00:25:52,885 --> 00:25:53,969
Okay.
All right.

217
00:25:54,387 --> 00:25:55,971
Oh. Uh, Cee?
Hmm?

218
00:25:56,472 --> 00:25:58,056
You mind getting Sydney up?

219
00:25:58,141 --> 00:26:00,559
She's actually pretty excited,
thanks to you. She, uh...

220
00:26:00,643 --> 00:26:02,769
She might need a little help
staying focused.

221
00:26:02,854 --> 00:26:04,146
You got it.

222
00:26:13,948 --> 00:26:16,825
<i>Syd, come on, girl.
You're gonna be late.</i>

223
00:26:42,643 --> 00:26:43,643
Shit!

224
00:26:43,728 --> 00:26:46,396
Shit! Shit! Shit!

225
00:26:47,148 --> 00:26:49,900
<i>No, no, no.
Don't use water.</i>

226
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:51,193
Excuse me. Sorry.

227
00:27:03,623 --> 00:27:04,623
Oh.

228
00:27:04,957 --> 00:27:05,999
Wow.

229
00:27:08,961 --> 00:27:11,296
You did that.
Yeah.

230
00:27:12,048 --> 00:27:13,757
You think we can salvage
it? No.

231
00:27:13,841 --> 00:27:15,801
No?
No. Sorry.

232
00:28:22,493 --> 00:28:23,702
James?

233
00:34:42,998 --> 00:34:43,998
James! James!

234
00:34:44,083 --> 00:34:45,959
James! James!

235
00:34:46,043 --> 00:34:47,896
<i>Yeah. What
happened? What happened? What?</i>

236
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,314
<i>I saw something right there.
Right there.</i>

237
00:34:49,338 --> 00:34:51,047
<i>There were footprints.
I saw it!</i>

238
00:34:51,131 --> 00:34:53,007
You saw footprints?

239
00:34:53,092 --> 00:34:55,468
<i>Yes, I saw... On the sheets!
I saw it, right there!</i>

240
00:34:55,970 --> 00:34:57,262
I saw them.

241
00:34:57,346 --> 00:34:58,471
On the sheet?

242
00:34:58,806 --> 00:34:59,931
I saw it.

243
00:35:01,392 --> 00:35:03,893
<i>There's someone in here.
There was someone in here.</i>

244
00:35:03,978 --> 00:35:05,080
Syd, put that stupid thing away.

245
00:35:05,104 --> 00:35:06,521
You're the one
who bought it for me!

246
00:35:06,605 --> 00:35:08,189
Who you gonna spray? Who?

247
00:35:10,025 --> 00:35:11,317
James, I saw it.

248
00:35:13,237 --> 00:35:14,529
I swear.

249
00:35:14,989 --> 00:35:16,864
Hey, Cee.

250
00:35:19,785 --> 00:35:22,078
Adrian will haunt you
if you let him.

251
00:35:22,997 --> 00:35:24,247
Don't let him.

252
00:35:27,376 --> 00:35:29,252
Now, you should try
and get some sleep.

253
00:35:29,878 --> 00:35:31,963
You have an important
job interview tomorrow,

254
00:35:32,047 --> 00:35:34,007
and I don't want
the memory of this...

255
00:35:35,676 --> 00:35:36,759
That...

256
00:35:37,928 --> 00:35:42,765
<i>This person to ruin it.
Okay?</i>

257
00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:45,143
Okay. Sorry.

258
00:35:53,902 --> 00:35:57,113
After Cal Poly, I worked
in Paris for six months.

259
00:35:57,448 --> 00:35:59,866
That was the best time
of my life for sure.

260
00:36:00,909 --> 00:36:02,827
Except for this next phase,
of course.

261
00:36:02,911 --> 00:36:03,953
Take a seat.

262
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:10,293
So, any reason you worked
in Paris in particular?

263
00:36:10,377 --> 00:36:12,022
Is that where all the
beautiful women in the world

264
00:36:12,046 --> 00:36:13,046
have to go as a rule?

265
00:36:15,382 --> 00:36:17,383
Well, I speak a little French,

266
00:36:17,468 --> 00:36:19,969
and I've always
wanted to live there.

267
00:36:20,054 --> 00:36:21,596
So after I graduated,

268
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:25,433
I went out there
on a totally student budget.

269
00:36:25,768 --> 00:36:27,894
I slept in a broom closet,
literally.

270
00:36:27,978 --> 00:36:30,313
I started this firm
in a supply closet, literally.

271
00:36:30,397 --> 00:36:32,231
<i>There you go.</i>

272
00:36:32,358 --> 00:36:34,442
We both know the value
of closet space. Yeah.

273
00:36:38,489 --> 00:36:39,655
Let me see some of your work.

274
00:36:40,366 --> 00:36:42,492
<i>Yes, of course.</i>

275
00:36:54,588 --> 00:36:55,588
Um...

276
00:36:58,133 --> 00:37:00,468
<i>I don't, uh...
I know that I...</i>

277
00:37:03,389 --> 00:37:07,016
<i>I know I put them in here, so I apologize.
I don't know what happened. Uh...</i>

278
00:37:07,101 --> 00:37:08,267
It's okay.

279
00:37:08,894 --> 00:37:11,521
Uh, you can send it to us,
whenever you get a chance.

280
00:37:12,189 --> 00:37:13,272
Okay.

281
00:37:13,357 --> 00:37:15,525
So, uh, let me tell you
about us.

282
00:37:15,901 --> 00:37:19,237
At Ruler, we approach
architecture on a human level.

283
00:37:19,321 --> 00:37:20,405
First and...

284
00:37:23,075 --> 00:37:24,158
Are you okay?

285
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:27,620
Um...

286
00:37:28,122 --> 00:37:29,288
I'm sorry.

287
00:37:29,915 --> 00:37:31,416
Uh, I'm just not feeling...

288
00:37:32,042 --> 00:37:33,709
Would you like some water, or...

289
00:37:36,130 --> 00:37:37,338
Cecilia?

290
00:37:40,592 --> 00:37:42,427
Are you feeling okay?

291
00:38:01,363 --> 00:38:02,697
Cecilia.

292
00:38:02,781 --> 00:38:03,990
Okay, so, uh,

293
00:38:04,074 --> 00:38:05,533
you probably shouldn't drive

294
00:38:05,617 --> 00:38:08,327
or operate any heavy machinery
for the next few days.

295
00:38:08,412 --> 00:38:10,913
But other than that,
you seem fine.

296
00:38:11,498 --> 00:38:14,041
Either myself or my admitting
will follow up with you

297
00:38:14,126 --> 00:38:16,919
with the results
of the blood test. Okay?

298
00:38:17,004 --> 00:38:18,796
Can you just leave a number
with the nurse?

299
00:38:18,881 --> 00:38:20,965
<i>You guys can go home.
Okay.</i>

300
00:38:24,052 --> 00:38:25,344
You ready?

301
00:38:25,429 --> 00:38:26,596
Yeah.

302
00:38:57,294 --> 00:38:59,462
<i>- Hello?
- Is Cecilia Kass there?</i>

303
00:38:59,546 --> 00:39:00,755
That's me.

304
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:03,966
<i>Hi. Uh, this is
Doctor Lee at St. Vincent's.</i>

305
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:08,387
<i>So, we got the results
of your blood test back,</i>

306
00:39:08,472 --> 00:39:12,850
<i>and it looks like the Diazepam was
the most likely cause of you fainting.</i>

307
00:39:12,935 --> 00:39:15,436
Um, sorry,
what Diazepam?

308
00:39:15,854 --> 00:39:18,898
<i>Well, your blood work showed
a very high amount of it.</i>

309
00:39:19,399 --> 00:39:22,026
<i>That would definitely explain
what happened to you.</i>

310
00:39:24,530 --> 00:39:27,240
<i>There's something else
I wanted to talk to you about,</i>

311
00:39:27,658 --> 00:39:31,494
<i>but I'm not sure if we should
do it over the phone, so, um...</i>

312
00:39:54,059 --> 00:39:55,351
Tell him to stop.

313
00:39:56,478 --> 00:39:57,603
<i>Tell who to stop what?</i>

314
00:39:57,688 --> 00:40:01,148
Tell him to stop
what he's doing.

315
00:40:01,233 --> 00:40:03,067
Do you know
what she's babbling about?

316
00:40:03,318 --> 00:40:06,070
Nah, she hasn't explained
to me why we're here yet.

317
00:40:06,154 --> 00:40:08,948
But being her very good friend,
I know it's a good reason.

318
00:40:09,032 --> 00:40:11,117
So I'm gonna need you
to sit up and listen.

319
00:40:11,201 --> 00:40:12,285
Show a little respect.

320
00:40:17,833 --> 00:40:20,293
One night,
I was sitting,

321
00:40:21,086 --> 00:40:22,878
and I was thinking about

322
00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:25,256
how to leave Adrian.

323
00:40:27,134 --> 00:40:29,635
I was planning the
whole thing in my mind.

324
00:40:30,721 --> 00:40:32,597
And he was staring at me.

325
00:40:33,682 --> 00:40:35,057
Studying me.

326
00:40:37,102 --> 00:40:39,895
And without me
saying a single word...

327
00:40:41,690 --> 00:40:44,025
He said that I could
never leave him.

328
00:40:45,402 --> 00:40:47,069
That wherever I went,

329
00:40:47,988 --> 00:40:49,655
he would find me.

330
00:40:51,450 --> 00:40:53,367
That he would
walk right up to me

331
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:56,203
and I wouldn't
be able to see him.

332
00:40:58,123 --> 00:41:00,082
But that he would
leave me a sign

333
00:41:00,917 --> 00:41:02,793
so that I'd know he was there.

334
00:41:10,927 --> 00:41:14,930
The night I left him,
I drugged him with that.

335
00:41:15,557 --> 00:41:17,475
I lost the bottle that night.

336
00:41:18,018 --> 00:41:21,312
And somehow, it found
its way back to me.

337
00:41:23,398 --> 00:41:25,274
So, what exactly are you saying?

338
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:28,611
You lost the bottle,
you found the bottle.

339
00:41:31,198 --> 00:41:32,823
He's not dead, Tom.

340
00:41:37,204 --> 00:41:41,999
I have a pile of ashes in a box that
would disagree with you, Cecilia.

341
00:41:43,418 --> 00:41:45,127
I don't know how he's done it.

342
00:41:47,464 --> 00:41:49,131
He's figured it out, though.

343
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:55,054
He has figured out
a way to be invisible.

344
00:42:00,519 --> 00:42:03,312
He is a world leader
in the field of optics.

345
00:42:03,397 --> 00:42:05,898
I know that he could do this.

346
00:42:09,611 --> 00:42:12,196
Something tells me you know
exactly what I'm talking about.

347
00:42:15,158 --> 00:42:17,159
He's not dead.

348
00:42:20,122 --> 00:42:21,706
I just can't see him.

349
00:42:23,083 --> 00:42:24,875
Please tell him to stop.

350
00:42:28,505 --> 00:42:29,505
Okay.

351
00:42:30,507 --> 00:42:32,007
I agree with you,

352
00:42:32,092 --> 00:42:33,551
Adrian was brilliant.

353
00:42:33,635 --> 00:42:35,761
But it wasn't because of
anything he invented.

354
00:42:35,846 --> 00:42:37,888
It was how he got
in people's heads.

355
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:41,225
That was his true genius,
knowing people's weaknesses.

356
00:42:43,061 --> 00:42:44,145
You think about it.

357
00:42:44,229 --> 00:42:47,273
He came up with the perfect way
to torture you, even in death.

358
00:42:48,567 --> 00:42:52,153
Only thing more brilliant than inventing
something that makes you invisible

359
00:42:52,237 --> 00:42:53,529
is not inventing it,

360
00:42:54,114 --> 00:42:55,740
but making you think he did.

361
00:42:57,784 --> 00:43:00,953
My brother controlled me long
before he met you, Cecilia.

362
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:02,913
I hated him.

363
00:43:03,707 --> 00:43:05,541
You and I,
we got that in common.

364
00:43:09,796 --> 00:43:12,214
I was relieved

365
00:43:14,801 --> 00:43:16,802
when I heard that he was dead.

366
00:43:25,061 --> 00:43:27,772
<i>He's gone, Cecilia.
I saw his body.</i>

367
00:43:30,275 --> 00:43:31,400
Listen to me.

368
00:43:34,321 --> 00:43:36,655
Don't let him win
by bringing him back to life.

369
00:44:07,687 --> 00:44:08,813
Hey.

370
00:44:09,523 --> 00:44:10,523
Hey.

371
00:44:13,068 --> 00:44:14,944
Emily, I need to talk to you.

372
00:44:15,028 --> 00:44:17,363
Well, at least
now we have clarity.

373
00:44:17,781 --> 00:44:19,657
Now I know
what you really think of me.

374
00:44:20,033 --> 00:44:21,033
What?

375
00:44:21,117 --> 00:44:23,577
Thanks so much
for carving out the time

376
00:44:23,662 --> 00:44:28,707
to let me know how
"suffocating" I am to you.

377
00:44:28,959 --> 00:44:29,959
What... What are you...

378
00:44:30,043 --> 00:44:31,877
Not that I should
have to say this,

379
00:44:31,962 --> 00:44:34,839
but I never expected
any of that money.

380
00:44:37,259 --> 00:44:39,635
<i>Emily, I don't... I don't
know what you're talking about.</i>

381
00:44:41,346 --> 00:44:43,722
<i>The e-mail. The e-mail
you sent me this morning.</i>

382
00:44:43,807 --> 00:44:46,058
<i>What e-mail? If that's
how you feel about me,</i>

383
00:44:46,142 --> 00:44:47,142
don't ask me to bail you

384
00:44:47,227 --> 00:44:48,978
out of your
personal life anymore.

385
00:44:49,062 --> 00:44:50,998
If you're too stupid
to know who the good guys are

386
00:44:51,022 --> 00:44:52,022
and too weak

387
00:44:52,107 --> 00:44:54,608
to get away from the bad ones,

388
00:44:54,693 --> 00:44:56,110
don't sob to me for charity.

389
00:44:56,194 --> 00:44:57,486
I'm out.

390
00:44:57,571 --> 00:44:59,655
I didn't send you
the fucking e-mail.

391
00:45:00,824 --> 00:45:01,824
I didn't.

392
00:45:02,367 --> 00:45:05,619
Someone is doing this to me.

393
00:45:06,413 --> 00:45:08,747
He's... He's doing this to me.

394
00:45:10,166 --> 00:45:11,250
Who's...

395
00:45:13,712 --> 00:45:14,753
Adrian?

396
00:45:17,924 --> 00:45:20,301
Adrian sent me
the e-mail. Okay.

397
00:45:24,306 --> 00:45:26,390
<i>You need some medication.
Adrian is dead.</i>

398
00:45:27,392 --> 00:45:29,143
Em, please, no.

399
00:46:48,056 --> 00:46:49,376
Cee?

400
00:47:05,115 --> 00:47:06,448
It's okay, Syd.

401
00:47:08,076 --> 00:47:09,910
<i>You... You know
what I think we need?</i>

402
00:47:10,286 --> 00:47:11,286
Um...

403
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:14,373
I think we could kick Dad out

404
00:47:15,792 --> 00:47:17,793
and have a little girls' night.

405
00:47:17,877 --> 00:47:19,086
<i>Eat some cake.</i>

406
00:47:27,053 --> 00:47:28,387
Yeah,

407
00:47:28,555 --> 00:47:30,180
I do like cake.

408
00:47:35,895 --> 00:47:38,480
<i>Oh, my God.
Sydney, are you okay?</i>

409
00:47:38,565 --> 00:47:40,774
<i>Why would you just...
Stop! Dad!</i>

410
00:47:40,859 --> 00:47:44,194
<i>What? No.
No, Sydney, I didn't. No.</i>

411
00:47:44,279 --> 00:47:46,155
<i>What? What happened?
She... She hit me.</i>

412
00:47:46,239 --> 00:47:48,407
<i>What?
No, no, no.</i>

413
00:47:48,491 --> 00:47:49,658
James, I did not do that.

414
00:47:49,743 --> 00:47:52,077
Sydney, I would never
hit you. I love you.

415
00:47:52,162 --> 00:47:55,330
<i>I would never do that, James. It
was him. He's here, I swear to you.</i>

416
00:47:55,415 --> 00:47:58,083
Enough. Enough!
Cee, enough.

417
00:47:58,460 --> 00:47:59,460
Just stop it.

418
00:47:59,544 --> 00:48:01,211
<i>Are you okay?
I don't wanna stay here.</i>

419
00:48:01,296 --> 00:48:03,881
<i>Sydney, I'm sorry.
I would never... Hey, hey.</i>

420
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:08,010
Cee, right now, my priority is
getting my baby somewhere safe.

421
00:48:08,094 --> 00:48:09,470
Do you understand?

422
00:48:09,554 --> 00:48:11,138
Come on, baby.
It's okay.

423
00:48:11,473 --> 00:48:13,307
No. James, please.

424
00:48:13,475 --> 00:48:14,767
This is what he wants.

425
00:48:14,851 --> 00:48:16,746
This is what he used to do
when we were together.

426
00:48:16,770 --> 00:48:19,813
He wants you to think that I
did it. This is what he does.

427
00:48:19,898 --> 00:48:22,274
He tries to isolate me and
he tries to get me alone...

428
00:48:22,442 --> 00:48:23,484
Hey!

429
00:48:23,568 --> 00:48:26,070
<i>You need to calm down.
You are scaring my daughter.</i>

430
00:48:27,197 --> 00:48:29,117
If I were you, I would
go to your sister's place.

431
00:48:29,157 --> 00:48:31,366
You don't need to be
here right now.

432
00:48:34,204 --> 00:48:35,621
Come on, Sydney.

433
00:48:36,539 --> 00:48:37,873
Sydney, I'm sorry. Sydney.

434
00:48:53,181 --> 00:48:54,431
Where are you?

435
00:48:56,309 --> 00:48:57,351
Come on!

436
00:49:01,106 --> 00:49:02,898
<i>Where are you?
Come on out.</i>

437
00:49:03,691 --> 00:49:05,275
Don't hit a little girl.

438
00:49:05,610 --> 00:49:06,777
Hit me!

439
00:49:09,739 --> 00:49:10,823
Okay.

440
00:50:02,375 --> 00:50:04,585
So, why me, Adrian?

441
00:50:10,091 --> 00:50:12,301
You could have
any woman you wanted.

442
00:50:17,390 --> 00:50:20,267
<i>That's the sad reality.
Right?</i>

443
00:50:21,186 --> 00:50:24,396
That's what money
and power buy you.

444
00:50:25,899 --> 00:50:26,899
People.

445
00:50:32,197 --> 00:50:33,280
So...

446
00:50:35,575 --> 00:50:36,867
Why me?

447
00:50:40,038 --> 00:50:42,539
I'm just a suburban girl

448
00:50:43,833 --> 00:50:46,668
who stumbled into your life
one night at a party.

449
00:50:52,717 --> 00:50:56,053
Can't you just forget
I ever existed?

450
00:51:01,935 --> 00:51:06,438
There's nothing left
for you to take.

451
00:51:14,364 --> 00:51:16,907
You've already taken it all.

452
00:52:37,488 --> 00:52:38,822
<i>This is Adrian Griffin.</i>

453
00:52:38,906 --> 00:52:41,783
<i>Please leave a message, and
I'll get back to you when I can.</i>

454
01:00:49,063 --> 01:00:51,022
<i>Cecilia?
Yes. Go.</i>

455
01:00:51,565 --> 01:00:53,316
Please, hurry.

456
01:00:53,442 --> 01:00:55,042
<i>Lock the doors. Lock
the doors! You okay?</i>

457
01:00:55,069 --> 01:00:57,320
<i>Yes. Please.
Please, just go. Please.</i>

458
01:01:03,869 --> 01:01:05,662
<i>Just... Please, hurry.
Please.</i>

459
01:01:10,835 --> 01:01:13,753
<i>Stinson Beach?
That's a long way from here.</i>

460
01:01:58,966 --> 01:02:01,009
<i>I... I just need
to get something.</i>

461
01:02:01,093 --> 01:02:02,802
Do you mind waiting for me?

462
01:02:02,887 --> 01:02:06,014
I might be two minutes, I
might be 20. I don't know...

463
01:02:07,141 --> 01:02:09,434
But you can bring me
back to the city after.

464
01:02:09,518 --> 01:02:11,311
Sure, no problem.
Okay.

465
01:03:08,827 --> 01:03:10,119
<i>Zeus.</i>

466
01:03:10,871 --> 01:03:13,748
Hi. Hi.

467
01:04:13,726 --> 01:04:17,270
12-14-17.

468
01:04:19,106 --> 01:04:20,815
The day we met.

469
01:04:33,454 --> 01:04:35,288
So romantic.

470
01:08:34,903 --> 01:08:38,447
Please, meet me tonight,
if you can, in a public place.

471
01:08:39,491 --> 01:08:40,825
Eight o'clock at Yulan.

472
01:08:40,909 --> 01:08:42,410
And if you can't,
I understand,

473
01:08:42,494 --> 01:08:45,454
but you have to tell me because
I have to call someone else,

474
01:08:45,539 --> 01:08:47,259
because I don't think
I have much time left.

475
01:08:50,085 --> 01:08:52,211
Thank you.
Thank you.

476
01:09:35,589 --> 01:09:36,589
Hi.

477
01:09:38,050 --> 01:09:39,258
Hey.

478
01:09:39,343 --> 01:09:41,719
<i>Hey, guys.
Welcome to Yulan.</i>

479
01:09:41,803 --> 01:09:44,638
My name is Taylor, and I will be
taking care of you this evening.

480
01:09:44,723 --> 01:09:45,992
Do you know
how this place works?

481
01:09:46,016 --> 01:09:48,476
I'm assuming you order
food, then you eat it. Hmm.

482
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:50,705
<i>Pretty much. We just do things
a little bit differently.</i>

483
01:09:50,729 --> 01:09:51,854
It's all family style.

484
01:09:51,938 --> 01:09:53,564
<i>We've been here before.
It's all good.</i>

485
01:09:53,648 --> 01:09:55,483
<i>Okay. Can I get you started
with some water?</i>

486
01:09:55,567 --> 01:09:57,526
<i>We have still or sparkling.
Just the free kind.</i>

487
01:09:57,611 --> 01:09:59,612
Okay, tap it is.
Cool.

488
01:10:03,158 --> 01:10:04,867
Thank you for being here.

489
01:10:08,121 --> 01:10:09,455
I love you.

490
01:10:12,209 --> 01:10:14,460
You're like a cop, Emily,

491
01:10:14,544 --> 01:10:17,505
and you have
this brute-force strength

492
01:10:17,589 --> 01:10:23,052
that is so, so comforting
when I'm in trouble

493
01:10:23,136 --> 01:10:27,306
and it is really
intimidating when I'm not.

494
01:10:27,849 --> 01:10:30,351
I mean, James actually
is a six-foot cop,

495
01:10:30,435 --> 01:10:33,020
and he's, I think,
really intimidated by you.

496
01:10:33,688 --> 01:10:35,523
<i>As he should be.
I'd kick his ass.</i>

497
01:10:37,484 --> 01:10:38,526
I would.

498
01:10:39,778 --> 01:10:40,945
You would.

499
01:10:43,115 --> 01:10:47,368
I need that strength
in my life right now.

500
01:10:48,787 --> 01:10:51,872
And I need you to believe
what I'm about to tell you.

501
01:10:54,918 --> 01:10:56,752
Okay. What...

502
01:11:01,883 --> 01:11:03,175
Thank you, Taylor.

503
01:11:06,430 --> 01:11:08,870
All right, uh, do you guys need
more time with the drink menu?

504
01:11:08,932 --> 01:11:11,308
Yes. Lots more time.

505
01:11:11,393 --> 01:11:13,394
Okay,
no problem at all.

506
01:11:17,107 --> 01:11:18,357
Emily...

507
01:11:21,987 --> 01:11:24,196
I went to his house today.

508
01:11:24,281 --> 01:11:26,407
<i>You went to Adrian's house?</i>
Yes.

509
01:11:27,784 --> 01:11:29,160
I just walked right in.

510
01:11:29,744 --> 01:11:34,498
I found something that can
prove what I'm experiencing.

511
01:11:34,583 --> 01:11:39,170
That can prove
that Adrian is stalking me.

512
01:11:40,630 --> 01:11:41,630
What is it?

513
01:11:42,466 --> 01:11:45,509
It's some kind of suit
that Adrian has built.

514
01:11:46,386 --> 01:11:48,804
And it has cameras,
and it somehow...

515
01:11:49,389 --> 01:11:50,556
What?

516
01:13:03,547 --> 01:13:05,506
No, please! No!

517
01:13:05,590 --> 01:13:07,466
You can't do this.
You can't do this!

518
01:13:07,551 --> 01:13:09,051
He killed her!
He killed her!

519
01:13:09,135 --> 01:13:12,221
<i>Please, I didn't do it!
I didn't do it!</i>

520
01:13:12,305 --> 01:13:15,057
No! No!

521
01:13:15,141 --> 01:13:17,393
He killed her!
He did it!

522
01:13:17,477 --> 01:13:19,770
<i>- You have to listen to me!
- Just relax.</i>

523
01:13:19,854 --> 01:13:21,480
Please, no! Please.

524
01:13:21,565 --> 01:13:23,649
No! No!

525
01:13:25,068 --> 01:13:26,402
Listen to me!

526
01:13:26,486 --> 01:13:27,945
No!

527
01:13:29,364 --> 01:13:30,948
You motherfucker!

528
01:13:33,076 --> 01:13:34,702
You killed her!

529
01:13:34,786 --> 01:13:36,245
I see you!

530
01:13:36,830 --> 01:13:38,497
I see you!

531
01:13:38,582 --> 01:13:40,082
He's here!
He's here!

532
01:13:40,166 --> 01:13:42,084
He's right here,
he's right here!

533
01:13:42,168 --> 01:13:45,170
<i>Please! You can't see him.
He's in the room!</i>

534
01:13:45,547 --> 01:13:48,507
<i>You have to listen to me!
He's right there!</i>

535
01:13:48,592 --> 01:13:50,092
He's gonna hurt me.

536
01:13:50,302 --> 01:13:51,969
<i>Okay.
Please! No...</i>

537
01:13:53,013 --> 01:13:54,013
He's...

538
01:14:05,692 --> 01:14:07,735
<i>He's right there.</i>
Okay?

539
01:14:08,820 --> 01:14:09,940
You'll be all right.

540
01:14:42,354 --> 01:14:43,896
Surprise.

541
01:14:54,908 --> 01:14:55,949
Cecilia...

542
01:14:57,327 --> 01:14:59,912
Can you confirm the person
in this video is you?

543
01:15:04,376 --> 01:15:07,294
And can you confirm you recently
fainted during a job interview

544
01:15:07,379 --> 01:15:10,255
due to a high amount of
Diazepam in your system?

545
01:15:17,263 --> 01:15:18,597
I was drugged.

546
01:15:18,682 --> 01:15:19,890
Uh-huh.

547
01:15:21,810 --> 01:15:24,395
You also sent your sister
an email a few days ago

548
01:15:24,479 --> 01:15:26,897
saying you wished
she was dead, didn't you?

549
01:15:37,367 --> 01:15:38,951
I have something.

550
01:15:40,704 --> 01:15:42,996
I have something
that'll prove he's alive.

551
01:15:44,165 --> 01:15:45,624
I found it.

552
01:15:46,710 --> 01:15:47,876
What do you have?

553
01:15:58,805 --> 01:16:02,474
I can't tell you right now.

554
01:16:03,476 --> 01:16:05,018
He's listening.

555
01:16:07,981 --> 01:16:09,898
He's in the room, James.

556
01:16:10,525 --> 01:16:14,653
You're saying that the person who killed
your sister is in the room right now,

557
01:16:14,738 --> 01:16:16,196
but we can't see him.

558
01:16:18,533 --> 01:16:19,616
Okay.

559
01:16:20,285 --> 01:16:21,368
Yeah.

560
01:16:25,498 --> 01:16:27,332
<i>James...</i>

561
01:16:29,085 --> 01:16:31,462
Tell me you don't think
I did this.

562
01:16:33,173 --> 01:16:34,673
Tell me you know that.

563
01:16:44,726 --> 01:16:46,935
I may as well
have done it, though.

564
01:16:53,693 --> 01:16:56,028
I brought Adrian into her life.

565
01:16:59,908 --> 01:17:01,283
I did that.

566
01:17:03,161 --> 01:17:05,788
I shouldn't have walked out
on you and left you alone.

567
01:17:08,833 --> 01:17:10,250
I failed you.

568
01:17:24,224 --> 01:17:27,684
Is this bed giving you
any problems, Cecilia?

569
01:17:28,311 --> 01:17:29,311
No.

570
01:17:30,563 --> 01:17:34,483
Is there anything in the room
that is distressing to you?

571
01:17:38,780 --> 01:17:39,780
No.

572
01:17:41,658 --> 01:17:43,325
Okay. Good.

573
01:17:44,786 --> 01:17:46,954
I wanted to talk to you
about something.

574
01:17:48,623 --> 01:17:52,417
We checked the blood test that you
had done at the hospital last week.

575
01:17:52,502 --> 01:17:54,837
Do you remember
taking those blood tests?

576
01:17:55,421 --> 01:17:56,421
Yes.

577
01:17:59,634 --> 01:18:00,634
Okay.

578
01:18:02,136 --> 01:18:05,055
Well, did you know
that you were pregnant?

579
01:18:28,079 --> 01:18:29,079
No.

580
01:18:31,374 --> 01:18:33,709
Didn't the doctor
who took the test tell you?

581
01:18:35,587 --> 01:18:37,546
<i>No, that can't be right.
That's...</i>

582
01:18:38,339 --> 01:18:39,715
That's not true.

583
01:18:40,258 --> 01:18:43,218
The test shows us
that it was pretty recent.

584
01:18:43,970 --> 01:18:45,512
We can't be sure
of exactly when,

585
01:18:45,597 --> 01:18:48,307
but it must've been some time
in the last month.

586
01:18:53,646 --> 01:18:57,357
Sweetie, is there anyone
we can call?

587
01:18:59,319 --> 01:19:00,444
Family?

588
01:19:02,780 --> 01:19:04,156
Any friends?

589
01:19:06,451 --> 01:19:07,659
Okay.

590
01:19:44,906 --> 01:19:47,240
It's upsetting to
see you in this condition.

591
01:19:50,161 --> 01:19:54,331
Even though things ended badly for you
and Adrian, I still look at you as family.

592
01:19:57,251 --> 01:19:58,585
Are you my lawyer now?

593
01:19:59,921 --> 01:20:02,172
I'm the lawyer
for your source of income.

594
01:20:03,341 --> 01:20:05,217
I represent my brother's trust.

595
01:20:06,970 --> 01:20:09,513
The money from his trust
was payable to you

596
01:20:10,056 --> 01:20:13,809
conditional upon you being subject
to criminal charges of any kind,

597
01:20:14,894 --> 01:20:17,145
or being ruled to be
mentally incompetent.

598
01:20:17,855 --> 01:20:20,857
Now, in light of
your current situation,

599
01:20:21,317 --> 01:20:25,487
it's my duty to inform you that any
further payments are to be halted.

600
01:20:26,990 --> 01:20:31,118
I know that you set up a bank account
for a friend of yours to go to college.

601
01:20:31,536 --> 01:20:35,580
So, I take no pleasure
in relaying that.

602
01:20:39,419 --> 01:20:41,545
I used to feel sorry for you.

603
01:20:43,631 --> 01:20:47,092
The blood relative
of a narcissist sociopath.

604
01:20:48,761 --> 01:20:50,470
Permanent punching bag.

605
01:20:52,015 --> 01:20:53,557
Handcuffed to his wallet.

606
01:20:55,685 --> 01:20:56,893
But now,

607
01:20:58,062 --> 01:21:01,314
I can see you
for what you really are.

608
01:21:04,068 --> 01:21:08,697
You're just the jellyfish
version of him.

609
01:21:12,827 --> 01:21:16,538
Everything but the spine.

610
01:21:19,250 --> 01:21:21,043
You can try to litigate it.

611
01:21:22,462 --> 01:21:24,379
But that's going to be
an expensive option.

612
01:21:24,464 --> 01:21:25,964
I can't see it working.

613
01:21:30,511 --> 01:21:31,636
However...

614
01:21:36,309 --> 01:21:40,062
if you sign this document and
forfeit your share of the trust,

615
01:21:40,813 --> 01:21:42,397
it'll be a lot cleaner.

616
01:21:54,660 --> 01:21:56,703
Or there's one option

617
01:21:57,872 --> 01:21:59,956
where this all goes away.

618
01:22:02,752 --> 01:22:04,544
Agree to have the baby

619
01:22:07,673 --> 01:22:09,299
and go back to him.

620
01:22:12,303 --> 01:22:16,223
You really think he didn't know you
were secretly using birth control?

621
01:22:17,100 --> 01:22:18,225
'Course he did.

622
01:22:19,602 --> 01:22:20,977
You should've known
he'd find out.

623
01:22:21,062 --> 01:22:22,979
You knew him as well as I did.

624
01:22:26,818 --> 01:22:29,194
He replaced them
with something else.

625
01:22:30,154 --> 01:22:32,864
You only thought you were
taking birth control pills.

626
01:22:35,326 --> 01:22:36,910
He was always going to find you,

627
01:22:36,994 --> 01:22:38,787
no matter what he had to do.

628
01:22:39,831 --> 01:22:43,041
He needs you because
you don't need him.

629
01:22:43,126 --> 01:22:45,210
No one's ever left him before.

630
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:48,421
But he's punished you
enough now.

631
01:22:48,840 --> 01:22:51,174
Now that he knows you're
the mother of his child.

632
01:22:52,552 --> 01:22:54,261
It's time to stop playing games.

633
01:22:57,598 --> 01:23:00,433
A new life with him
can be given to you

634
01:23:01,769 --> 01:23:03,603
with one phone call.

635
01:23:04,939 --> 01:23:07,357
A life just like
your old one with Adrian.

636
01:23:08,067 --> 01:23:11,486
Cecilia, you don't really
have a choice right now.

637
01:23:11,571 --> 01:23:13,822
Right now,
you're a murderer.

638
01:23:16,367 --> 01:23:17,951
But I can change that.

639
01:23:35,136 --> 01:23:37,304
Adrian killed my sister.

640
01:23:37,680 --> 01:23:39,598
And you helped him.

641
01:23:45,354 --> 01:23:48,315
I don't expect
you to make a decision right now.

642
01:23:52,862 --> 01:23:54,738
I can come back in three days.

643
01:23:59,535 --> 01:24:01,077
Be good to yourself until then.

644
01:24:01,913 --> 01:24:03,371
We'll be watching.

645
01:24:09,420 --> 01:24:11,481
<i>Grab the
umbrella, grab your rain jacket,</i>

646
01:24:11,505 --> 01:24:13,340
<i>grab your rain boots,
you're gonna need it.</i>

647
01:24:13,424 --> 01:24:15,050
<i>You'll need them
for a couple of days.</i>

648
01:24:15,134 --> 01:24:16,718
<i>This pattern we're in stays put.</i>

649
01:24:17,261 --> 01:24:21,556
<i>We've got this atmospheric river
pointed right here at central California.</i>

650
01:24:21,641 --> 01:24:24,476
<i>And that means cloudy and rainy</i>

651
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:26,144
<i>as we get through
the rest of the week.</i>

652
01:24:26,229 --> 01:24:27,979
<i>This is a lot of moisture
coming in.</i>

653
01:24:28,064 --> 01:24:31,316
<i>It's going to mean heavy rainfall
and flash-flooding concerns</i>

654
01:24:31,400 --> 01:24:33,485
<i>right as we get through
the end of the week.</i>

655
01:24:33,569 --> 01:24:34,609
<i>It's not until the weekend</i>

656
01:24:34,654 --> 01:24:37,572
<i>that we get our next chance
of seeing some dry conditions.</i>

657
01:24:37,657 --> 01:24:41,493
<i>In fact, the next glimpse of sunshine
doesn't come until Sunday afternoon,</i>

658
01:24:41,577 --> 01:24:43,453
<i>when temperatures
hit the mid-60s.</i>

659
01:24:43,537 --> 01:24:46,456
<i>But until then, it's gonna
be cool, it's gonna be damp...</i>

660
01:25:07,979 --> 01:25:09,145
Open your mouth.

661
01:25:10,439 --> 01:25:11,439
Tongue up.

662
01:25:12,483 --> 01:25:13,483
Tongue down.

663
01:25:14,527 --> 01:25:16,778
Okay. Good night.

664
01:26:31,479 --> 01:26:33,355
You won't get the baby.

665
01:26:34,982 --> 01:26:36,858
And you won't get me.

666
01:26:46,577 --> 01:26:47,619
There you are.

667
01:26:55,419 --> 01:26:57,337
Fuck you!

668
01:27:04,678 --> 01:27:06,054
Get back in bed, now.

669
01:27:37,461 --> 01:27:38,461
Hey!

670
01:27:39,547 --> 01:27:41,131
No! No!

671
01:27:41,215 --> 01:27:43,758
Please, no! No!

672
01:27:44,343 --> 01:27:46,386
No! Stop!

673
01:27:46,804 --> 01:27:48,513
No, please! No!

674
01:27:49,390 --> 01:27:52,267
No, stop!
No, stop!

675
01:27:52,351 --> 01:27:53,852
He's right there!

676
01:28:17,293 --> 01:28:18,418
Lay down.

677
01:28:18,502 --> 01:28:19,711
He's right there.

678
01:28:20,337 --> 01:28:21,880
Lay down.

679
01:28:21,964 --> 01:28:24,132
<i>He's right behind you.
Listen to me.</i>

680
01:28:24,216 --> 01:28:25,216
Who is?

681
01:28:25,301 --> 01:28:26,926
He's right behind you.

682
01:28:27,845 --> 01:28:30,972
<i>I understand, Cecilia. Lay down.
Turn around! He's right there!</i>

683
01:28:32,057 --> 01:28:34,184
<i>Listen to me!
He's right behind you!</i>

684
01:28:34,268 --> 01:28:35,477
Stay down.

685
01:29:18,521 --> 01:29:20,230
No, no.

686
01:29:20,314 --> 01:29:21,439
Bang.

687
01:30:17,580 --> 01:30:20,123
Hey! Okay.
Get back! Get back!

688
01:31:20,184 --> 01:31:21,267
She's over here!

689
01:31:22,269 --> 01:31:24,562
You go left!
All right.

690
01:32:39,722 --> 01:32:41,931
You think you're
learning how to beat me,

691
01:32:42,015 --> 01:32:44,350
so I'm gonna
truly teach you something.

692
01:32:44,435 --> 01:32:47,019
If you fight me,
I won't ever hurt you.

693
01:32:47,104 --> 01:32:49,355
I'll find someone you love
and hurt them instead.

694
01:32:49,690 --> 01:32:51,292
<i>Copy. We're following.</i>

695
01:32:51,316 --> 01:32:55,153
Now you've only got yourself to blame
for that innocent young girl's death.

696
01:32:55,237 --> 01:32:56,487
No, please!

697
01:32:56,572 --> 01:32:58,281
Not Sydney.
Adrian, no.

698
01:32:59,533 --> 01:33:00,950
<i>Hold it!
Show me your hands!</i>

699
01:33:35,402 --> 01:33:36,402
Hey!

700
01:33:42,534 --> 01:33:44,827
Cecilia, don't do
anything stupid.

701
01:33:47,539 --> 01:33:48,915
I'm over here!

702
01:33:49,416 --> 01:33:50,416
Hey,
stop her!

703
01:33:51,585 --> 01:33:53,336
She's heading
towards the main exit!

704
01:34:25,994 --> 01:34:27,954
<i>What the...
What the fuck?</i>

705
01:34:30,666 --> 01:34:33,000
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

706
01:34:34,086 --> 01:34:35,086
Hey!

707
01:34:35,671 --> 01:34:37,797
<i>Harry, what's going on?
Harry?</i>

708
01:34:37,881 --> 01:34:39,048
What are you... Hey!

709
01:34:39,466 --> 01:34:42,093
<i>Hello?
Harry, are you okay?</i>

710
01:34:42,177 --> 01:34:43,427
<i>He's fine.
He's fine, I promise.</i>

711
01:34:43,512 --> 01:34:44,887
<i>What?
Who is this?</i>

712
01:34:57,985 --> 01:34:59,170
<i>This is James Lanier.</i>

713
01:34:59,194 --> 01:35:00,403
James, it's me.

714
01:35:00,571 --> 01:35:02,029
Cee?

715
01:35:02,114 --> 01:35:03,239
<i>How are you calling me?</i>

716
01:35:03,323 --> 01:35:05,343
<i>It doesn't matter about that.
You have to listen to me.</i>

717
01:35:05,367 --> 01:35:06,409
<i>No, it does matter.</i>

718
01:35:06,493 --> 01:35:07,577
Come on!

719
01:35:09,872 --> 01:35:11,122
<i>You can't be calling me.</i>

720
01:35:11,206 --> 01:35:13,291
<i>James, listen to me!
Sydney's life is in danger.</i>

721
01:35:13,375 --> 01:35:14,500
Where are you right now?

722
01:35:14,585 --> 01:35:15,825
<i>I'm at work.
She's at the house.</i>

723
01:35:17,629 --> 01:35:19,589
You need to go to her
right now, James.

724
01:35:19,673 --> 01:35:20,756
Do you hear me?

725
01:35:20,841 --> 01:35:23,175
'Cause I'm afraid Adrian is
gonna do something to her.

726
01:37:20,544 --> 01:37:21,627
Sydney.

727
01:37:24,131 --> 01:37:25,131
Sydney.

728
01:37:27,134 --> 01:37:28,551
Syd, you okay?

729
01:37:28,635 --> 01:37:30,594
Sydney...

730
01:37:54,494 --> 01:37:56,704
Stop!

731
01:37:57,581 --> 01:37:58,581
No!

732
01:38:01,668 --> 01:38:03,002
Stop!

733
01:38:04,880 --> 01:38:07,173
Stop!

734
01:38:08,258 --> 01:38:09,967
Stop!

735
01:38:10,052 --> 01:38:11,594
Dad!

736
01:38:12,929 --> 01:38:14,055
No!

737
01:38:23,148 --> 01:38:24,148
Sydney, get down!

738
01:39:05,190 --> 01:39:06,398
Don't cry.

739
01:39:18,120 --> 01:39:19,286
Tom?

740
01:40:09,629 --> 01:40:11,189
Is someone there?

741
01:40:11,631 --> 01:40:12,631
Help!

742
01:40:13,091 --> 01:40:14,175
Help!

743
01:40:14,718 --> 01:40:16,760
Please. Help!

744
01:40:16,845 --> 01:40:17,928
Stand clear!

745
01:40:22,392 --> 01:40:24,101
<i>Police!
Show me your hands.</i>

746
01:40:24,394 --> 01:40:27,104
<i>Our tactical team
found Adrian this morning,</i>

747
01:40:27,981 --> 01:40:29,690
tied up in his basement.

748
01:40:30,901 --> 01:40:33,819
Looks like he was a victim of
his brother just like you were.

749
01:40:36,198 --> 01:40:37,198
No.

750
01:40:39,117 --> 01:40:41,827
<i>No, James.
That's not right.</i>

751
01:40:41,912 --> 01:40:43,787
Adrian did this to me.

752
01:40:48,877 --> 01:40:50,544
He is not the victim here.

753
01:40:52,547 --> 01:40:55,007
He was tied up in his basement.

754
01:40:55,508 --> 01:40:58,594
If he faked his own death, he
could fake his own kidnapping.

755
01:40:58,678 --> 01:41:00,971
We have Tom's body
laying in my living room,

756
01:41:01,056 --> 01:41:03,599
wearing some sort of suit
that you shot to pieces.

757
01:41:03,683 --> 01:41:06,393
If it did work,
it doesn't now.

758
01:41:06,478 --> 01:41:10,189
But we have a whole bunch of corroborative
witnesses from the psychiatric hospital

759
01:41:10,273 --> 01:41:12,483
when it comes to seeing
something strange.

760
01:41:12,567 --> 01:41:16,654
Look, this is your best-case scenario
for getting your freedom back, okay?

761
01:41:17,739 --> 01:41:18,739
No.

762
01:41:19,324 --> 01:41:20,324
I...

763
01:41:20,575 --> 01:41:24,203
I know Tom's body is in
your living room. Yeah.

764
01:41:26,539 --> 01:41:28,916
Adrian did everything
before that though.

765
01:41:32,087 --> 01:41:33,837
He set his own brother up.

766
01:41:34,673 --> 01:41:36,674
I know how this works, Cee.

767
01:41:36,758 --> 01:41:38,384
<i>I know.
You don't understand.</i>

768
01:41:38,468 --> 01:41:39,551
No, you don't understand.

769
01:41:40,428 --> 01:41:42,012
This is what he does.

770
01:41:43,390 --> 01:41:45,557
He makes me feel
like I'm the crazy one.

771
01:41:48,520 --> 01:41:51,772
<i>This is...
This is what he does.</i>

772
01:41:53,733 --> 01:41:55,192
And he's doing it again.

773
01:41:55,277 --> 01:41:56,443
Okay, okay.
But, listen.

774
01:41:56,528 --> 01:41:58,654
I need you to
keep that to yourself

775
01:41:58,738 --> 01:42:00,239
and let me do my job.

776
01:42:00,323 --> 01:42:02,741
Okay?

777
01:42:02,826 --> 01:42:04,576
Just let me help you.

778
01:42:04,661 --> 01:42:07,788
Yeah, but as long as Adrian's
around, you can't help me.

779
01:42:56,421 --> 01:42:57,588
Cecilia?

780
01:43:00,091 --> 01:43:01,842
<i>I'm so glad you called.</i>

781
01:43:41,341 --> 01:43:42,383
Well...

782
01:43:44,094 --> 01:43:45,344
You look amazing.

783
01:43:46,471 --> 01:43:49,264
<i>I mean, you always...
You always look amazing.</i>

784
01:43:50,350 --> 01:43:52,017
I don't feel amazing.

785
01:43:53,228 --> 01:43:54,603
It's all a lie.

786
01:43:56,356 --> 01:43:57,648
Please, come on in.

787
01:43:58,316 --> 01:43:59,858
It's cold.
Come on.

788
01:44:23,883 --> 01:44:26,176
<i>So, I... I wanted to
get us some simple takeout,</i>

789
01:44:26,261 --> 01:44:29,346
but of course I started obsessing
over what you'd be in the mood for.

790
01:44:29,431 --> 01:44:32,391
Hence, we have the OCD buffet
of sushi, steak, and pasta.

791
01:44:34,936 --> 01:44:37,062
Or you might not
be hungry at all.

792
01:44:37,147 --> 01:44:38,147
Uh...

793
01:44:38,231 --> 01:44:41,692
Which is so logical that it suddenly
makes this feast look moronic.

794
01:44:41,776 --> 01:44:43,569
I'll have steak.

795
01:44:43,945 --> 01:44:45,065
That's a good choice.

796
01:44:54,622 --> 01:44:55,831
Uh...

797
01:44:56,458 --> 01:44:57,791
<i>My hand's shaking.</i>

798
01:45:06,551 --> 01:45:08,311
You know, you're the only
person in the world

799
01:45:08,386 --> 01:45:10,012
who gets to see my hand shake.

800
01:45:12,557 --> 01:45:14,391
It's 'cause I need you, Cecilia.

801
01:45:16,853 --> 01:45:20,272
I know I didn't treat you the
way you should have been treated

802
01:45:20,982 --> 01:45:22,316
when we were together.

803
01:45:23,151 --> 01:45:25,944
But I've learned my lesson.

804
01:45:28,823 --> 01:45:33,535
I would burn everything I own
just to prove that to you.

805
01:45:38,166 --> 01:45:39,249
Okay.

806
01:45:41,669 --> 01:45:42,669
Okay.

807
01:45:45,548 --> 01:45:49,551
If you want to be a part
of this child's life,

808
01:45:52,555 --> 01:45:54,806
it has to start with honesty.

809
01:45:55,642 --> 01:45:56,808
Of course.

810
01:46:02,524 --> 01:46:07,069
Which means I need you to
admit everything that you did.

811
01:46:11,491 --> 01:46:12,824
That it was you,

812
01:46:14,452 --> 01:46:15,911
not your brother.

813
01:46:18,790 --> 01:46:19,957
You.

814
01:46:22,210 --> 01:46:23,669
Cecilia.

815
01:46:28,132 --> 01:46:29,424
I loved my brother.

816
01:46:30,218 --> 01:46:31,510
And I thought he loved me, too.

817
01:46:35,431 --> 01:46:38,141
I know it didn't seem like it
to the outside world,

818
01:46:41,563 --> 01:46:43,063
but Tom controlled me.

819
01:46:45,567 --> 01:46:47,127
Just tell me the truth.

820
01:46:47,777 --> 01:46:51,113
I need to know
that I'm not crazy.

821
01:46:51,197 --> 01:46:52,322
Okay?

822
01:46:56,995 --> 01:46:59,454
And we can't start this
with a lie.

823
01:46:59,539 --> 01:47:01,707
But I'm not starting with a lie.

824
01:47:05,295 --> 01:47:06,795
It wasn't me.

825
01:47:07,714 --> 01:47:09,047
I swear it.

826
01:47:09,132 --> 01:47:11,758
Why can't you just
tell me the truth?

827
01:47:12,635 --> 01:47:14,303
I am.

828
01:47:14,387 --> 01:47:15,929
Adrian, stop!

829
01:47:20,184 --> 01:47:23,353
I need you to do this for me.

830
01:47:25,815 --> 01:47:28,483
<i>More than
that, do it for you, Adrian.</i>

831
01:47:31,487 --> 01:47:34,531
<i>I'm giving you exactly
what you're asking for, Cecilia.</i>

832
01:47:36,534 --> 01:47:40,412
I am telling you the truth.

833
01:47:50,256 --> 01:47:52,132
<i>Oh, no, no, no.</i>

834
01:47:57,305 --> 01:48:00,265
I know that you feel like
you're going insane sometimes.

835
01:48:01,392 --> 01:48:03,894
But I'm the only one
who can help you.

836
01:48:04,520 --> 01:48:05,604
Remember?

837
01:48:06,773 --> 01:48:09,816
Because I know you better
than anyone else in the world.

838
01:48:11,861 --> 01:48:12,944
I mean...

839
01:48:14,280 --> 01:48:16,031
That shouldn't come as a...

840
01:48:17,825 --> 01:48:19,117
Surprise.

841
01:48:37,303 --> 01:48:39,137
I should go clean myself up.

842
01:48:39,222 --> 01:48:40,806
Of course.

843
01:50:03,514 --> 01:50:04,514
No!

844
01:50:07,393 --> 01:50:09,603
<i>No, no!
What did you do?</i>

845
01:50:10,521 --> 01:50:12,230
<i>911,
what is your emergency?</i>

846
01:50:12,315 --> 01:50:14,065
Please, you have to help me,
please.

847
01:50:14,150 --> 01:50:15,734
I'm with somebody,
and I think he's...

848
01:50:15,818 --> 01:50:17,402
He's tried to kill himself.

849
01:50:17,487 --> 01:50:18,904
<i>Hurry.
You have to help.</i>

850
01:50:24,285 --> 01:50:26,453
<i>You have to hurry.
Please.</i>

851
01:50:26,913 --> 01:50:31,833
It's, uh,
3333 Celestial Drive.

852
01:50:34,545 --> 01:50:35,670
Please.

853
01:50:55,483 --> 01:50:56,650
Surprise.

854
01:51:24,846 --> 01:51:26,763
Hey. Hey.
You okay?

855
01:51:26,848 --> 01:51:28,348
I'm okay.
I'm okay.

856
01:51:28,432 --> 01:51:30,433
<i>James, look at me.
I'm okay.</i>

857
01:51:32,228 --> 01:51:33,603
He killed himself.

858
01:51:37,483 --> 01:51:38,817
He cut his own throat.

859
01:51:39,527 --> 01:51:41,278
There's security camera
video of it.

860
01:51:54,292 --> 01:51:58,128
You never did want to get him
admitting anything on tape, did you?

861
01:51:58,963 --> 01:52:00,297
Of course I did.

862
01:52:02,049 --> 01:52:04,509
I just didn't know
he was that unstable.

863
01:52:11,893 --> 01:52:13,393
You heard it, right?

864
01:52:15,021 --> 01:52:16,104
James?

865
01:52:19,567 --> 01:52:21,359
What'd it sound like to you?

866
01:52:29,535 --> 01:52:32,162
It sounded a lot like
he killed himself.
