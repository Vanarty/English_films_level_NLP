<i>One by one, it will destroy them all.</i>

1542
02:43:50,652 --> 02:43:53,487
<i>FRODO:<br/>If you ask it of</i> me...

1543
02:43:53,488 --> 02:43:57,616
<i>...I will give you the One Ring.</i>

1544
02:43:57,617 --> 02:44:02,617
You offer it to me freely.

1545
02:44:04,332 --> 02:44:09,332
I do not deny that my heart<br/>has greatly desired this.

1546
02:44:14,676 --> 02:44:18,387
In place of a Dark Lord,<br/>you would have a queen...

1547
02:44:18,388 --> 02:44:22,850
...not dark but beautiful,<br/>and terrible as the dawn!

1548
02:44:22,851 --> 02:44:26,353
Treacherous as the sea!

1549
02:44:26,354 --> 02:44:31,354
Stronger than the foundations<br/>of the earth!

1550
02:44:31,776 --> 02:44:34,361
All shall love me...

1551
02:44:34,362 --> 02:44:39,362
...and despair.

1552
02:44:51,296 --> 02:44:55,883
I pass the test. I will diminish...

1553
02:44:55,884 --> 02:44:58,552
...and go into the West...

1554
02:44:58,553 --> 02:45:03,553
-...and remain Galadriel.<br/>- I cannot do this alone.

1555
02:45:06,603 --> 02:45:11,603
You are a Ring-bearer, Frodo.<br/>To bear a Ring of Power...

1556
02:45:11,691 --> 02:45:16,528
...is to be alone.

1557
02:45:16,529 --> 02:45:19,448
This is Nenya,<br/>the Ring of Adamant.

1558
02:45:19,449 --> 02:45:24,244
And I am its keeper.

1559
02:45:24,245 --> 02:45:28,916
This task was appointed to you.

1560
02:45:28,917 --> 02:45:33,045
And if you do not find a way...

1561
02:45:33,046 --> 02:45:35,422
...no one will.

1562
02:45:35,423 --> 02:45:39,259
Then I know what I must do.

1563
02:45:39,260 --> 02:45:43,722
It's just...

1564
02:45:43,723 --> 02:45:48,723
...I'm afraid to do it.

1565
02:45:49,437 --> 02:45:54,437
Even the smallest person can change<br/>the course of the future.

1566
02:45:59,948 --> 02:46:04,948
Do you know how the Orcs<br/>first came into being?

1567
02:46:06,454 --> 02:46:10,958
They were Elves once.

1568
02:46:10,959 --> 02:46:14,461
Taken by the Dark Powers...

1569
02:46:14,462 --> 02:46:17,965
...tortured and mutilated.

1570
02:46:17,966 --> 02:46:22,966
A ruined and terrible form of life.

1571
02:46:23,596 --> 02:46:26,890
And now...

1572
02:46:26,891 --> 02:46:29,476
...perfected.

1573
02:46:29,477 --> 02:46:34,477
My fighting Uruk-hai...

1574
02:46:34,607 --> 02:46:37,150
...whom do you serve?

1575
02:46:37,151 --> 02:46:42,151
Saruman!

1576
02:47:00,508 --> 02:47:04,177
Hunt them down. Do not stop<br/>until they are found.

1577
02:47:04,178 --> 02:47:07,306
You do not know pain.<br/>You do not know fear.

1578
02:47:07,307 --> 02:47:12,307
You will taste Man-flesh!

1579
02:47:15,315 --> 02:47:19,192
One of the half lings carries<br/>something of great value.

1580
02:47:19,193 --> 02:47:24,193
Bring them to me alive and unspoiled.

1581
02:47:25,199 --> 02:47:30,199
Kill the others.

1582
02:47:45,678 --> 02:47:50,678
CELEBORN: Never before have we clad<br/>strangers in the garb of our own people.

1583
02:47:52,226 --> 02:47:57,226
May these cloaks help shield you<br/>from unfriendly eyes.

1584
02:48:03,237 --> 02:48:05,030
Lembas.

1585
02:48:05,031 --> 02:48:09,117
Elvish waybread.

1586
02:48:09,118 --> 02:48:14,118
One small bite is enough to fill<br/>the stomach of a grown man.

1587
02:48:18,586 --> 02:48:20,754
How many did you eat?

1588
02:48:20,755 --> 02:48:23,924
<i>Four.</i>

1589
02:48:23,925 --> 02:48:28,220
[BELCHES]

1590
02:48:28,221 --> 02:48:31,014
CELEBORN: <i>Every league you travel south,<br/>the danger will increase.</i>

1591
02:48:31,015 --> 02:48:35,268
<i>Mordor Orcs now hold the eastern shore<br/>of the Anduin.</i>

1592
02:48:35,269 --> 02:48:38,021
<i>Nor will you find safety<br/>on the western bank.</i>

1593
02:48:38,022 --> 02:48:42,025
Strange creatures bearing the White Hand<br/>have been seen on our borders.

1594
02:48:42,026 --> 02:48:47,026
Seldom do Orcs journey in the open<br/>under the sun, yet these have done so.

1595
02:48:55,790 --> 02:48:59,793
[IN ELVISH]<br/>You are being tracked.

1596
02:48:59,794 --> 02:49:01,211
[IN ENGLISH]<br/>By river you have the chance...

1597
02:49:01,212 --> 02:49:06,212
...of outrunning the enemy<br/>to the Falls of Rauros.

1598
02:49:21,691 --> 02:49:26,691
GALADRIEL: My gift for you, Legolas,<br/>is a bow of the Galadhrim.

1599
02:49:26,779 --> 02:49:31,779
Worthy of the skill<br/>of our woodland kin.

1600
02:49:35,663 --> 02:49:38,290
These are the daggers of the Noldorin.

1601
02:49:38,291 --> 02:49:41,668
They have already seen service in war.

1602
02:49:41,669 --> 02:49:44,880
Do not fear, young Peregrin Took.

1603
02:49:44,881 --> 02:49:49,881
<i>You will find your courage.</i>

1604
02:49:50,094 --> 02:49:52,220
<i>And for you, Samwise Gamgee...</i>

1605
02:49:52,221 --> 02:49:54,973
...Elven rope made of hithlain.

1606
02:49:54,974 --> 02:49:58,894
Thank you, my lady.

1607
02:49:58,895 --> 02:50:03,895
Have you run out<br/>of those nice, shiny daggers?

1608
02:50:08,696 --> 02:50:11,865
And what gift would a dwarf ask<br/>of the Elves?

1609
02:50:11,866 --> 02:50:14,659
Nothing.

1610
02:50:14,660 --> 02:50:18,622
Except to look upon the lady<br/>of the Galadhrim one last time...

1611
02:50:18,623 --> 02:50:23,623
...for she is more fair<br/>than all the jewels beneath the earth.

1612
02:50:30,885 --> 02:50:32,636
Actually...

1613
02:50:32,637 --> 02:50:35,055
There was one thing.

1614
02:50:35,056 --> 02:50:37,891
No, no, I'm talking nonsense.<br/>It's quite impossible.

1615
02:50:37,892 --> 02:50:42,892
<i>Stupid to ask.</i>

1616
02:50:43,231 --> 02:50:45,565
GALADRIEL:<br/><i>I have nothing greater to give...</i>

1617
02:50:45,566 --> 02:50:50,362
...than the gift you already bear.

1618
02:50:50,363 --> 02:50:52,697
[IN ELVISH]<br/>For her love,

1619
02:50:52,698 --> 02:50:57,698
I fear the grace of Arwen Evenstar<br/>will diminish.

1620
02:50:58,788 --> 02:51:03,667
[IN ELVISH]<br/>I would have her leave these shores,

1621
02:51:03,668 --> 02:51:08,588
and be with her people.

1622
02:51:08,589 --> 02:51:13,589
I would have her take the ship to Valinor.

1623
02:51:14,804 --> 02:51:18,473
[IN ENGLISH]<br/>That choice is yet before her.

1624
02:51:18,474 --> 02:51:21,726
You have your own choice to make,<br/>Aragorn.

1625
02:51:21,727 --> 02:51:26,727
To rise above the height of all<br/>your fathers since the days of Elendil...

1626
02:51:27,733 --> 02:51:32,733
...or to fall into darkness<br/>with all that is left of your kin.

1627
02:51:39,203 --> 02:51:44,203
[IN ELVISH]<br/>Farewell.

1628
02:51:44,375 --> 02:51:49,375
There is much you have yet to do.

1629
02:51:54,260 --> 02:51:55,719
We shall not meet again...

1630
02:51:55,720 --> 02:51:59,639
Elessar.

1631
02:51:59,640 --> 02:52:02,976
<i>[IN ENGLISH]<br/>Farewell, Frodo Baggins.</i>

1632
02:52:02,977 --> 02:52:07,147
I give you the light of Eérendil...

1633
02:52:07,148 --> 02:52:12,148
...our most beloved star.

1634
02:52:18,659 --> 02:52:23,288
<i>May it be a light for you<br/>in dark places...</i>

1635
02:52:23,289 --> 02:52:28,289
<i>...when all other lights go out.</i>

1636
02:52:36,177 --> 02:52:40,013
GIMLI: I have taken my worst wound<br/>at this parting...

1637
02:52:40,014 --> 02:52:45,014
...having looked my last upon that<br/>which is fairest.

1638
02:52:45,019 --> 02:52:48,647
Henceforth I will call nothing fair<br/>unless it be her gift to me.

1639
02:52:48,648 --> 02:52:50,774
What was her gift?

1640
02:52:50,775 --> 02:52:55,775
I asked her for one hair<br/>from her golden head.

1641
02:52:56,489 --> 02:53:01,489
She gave me three.

1642
02:54:04,890 --> 02:54:09,890
[BIRDS SQUAWKING]

1643
02:54:41,510 --> 02:54:46,510
Gollum. He has tracked us since Moria.

1644
02:54:48,684 --> 02:54:52,020
I had hoped we would lose him<br/>on the river.

1645
02:54:52,021 --> 02:54:56,024
But he's too clever a Waterman.

1646
02:54:56,025 --> 02:54:59,486
And if he alerts the enemy<br/>to our whereabouts...

1647
02:54:59,487 --> 02:55:01,946
...it will make the crossing<br/>even more dangerous.

1648
02:55:01,947 --> 02:55:04,157
SAM:<br/>Have some food, Mr. Frodo.

1649
02:55:04,158 --> 02:55:07,452
- No, Sam.<br/>- You haven't eaten anything all day.

1650
02:55:07,453 --> 02:55:11,498
You're not sleeping, neither.<br/>Don't think I haven't noticed.

1651
02:55:11,499 --> 02:55:14,667
- Mr. Frodo--<br/>- I'm all right.

1652
02:55:14,668 --> 02:55:16,127
But you're not.

1653
02:55:16,128 --> 02:55:18,797
I'm hereto help you.

1654
02:55:18,798 --> 02:55:23,798
I promised Gandalf that I would.

1655
02:55:26,472 --> 02:55:31,351
You can't help me, Sam.

1656
02:55:31,352 --> 02:55:35,980
Not this time.

1657
02:55:35,981 --> 02:55:40,981
Get some sleep.

1658
02:55:44,407 --> 02:55:47,033
Minas Tirith is the safer road.

1659
02:55:47,034 --> 02:55:50,495
You know that.<br/>From there we can regroup.

1660
02:55:50,496 --> 02:55:53,039
Strike out for Mordor from a place<br/>of strength.

1661
02:55:53,040 --> 02:55:56,376
There is no strength in Gondor<br/>that can avail us.

1662
02:55:56,377 --> 02:56:00,255
You were quick enough to trust<br/>the Elves.

1663
02:56:00,256 --> 02:56:03,258
Have you so little faith<br/>in your own people?

1664
02:56:03,259 --> 02:56:06,469
Yes, there is weakness.<br/>There is frailty.

1665
02:56:06,470 --> 02:56:10,014
But there is courage also,<br/>and honor to be found in Men.

1666
02:56:10,015 --> 02:56:12,559
But you will not see that.

1667
02:56:12,560 --> 02:56:14,227
You are afraid!

1668
02:56:14,228 --> 02:56:17,063
All your life, you have hidden<br/>in the shadows.

1669
02:56:17,064 --> 02:56:22,064
Scared of who you are,<br/>of what you are.

1670
02:56:22,903 --> 02:56:27,903
I will not lead the Ring within<br/>a hundred leagues of your city.

02:56:39,128 --> 02:56:42,380
Frodo.

1672
02:56:42,381 --> 02:56:47,302
The Argonath.

1673
02:56:47,303 --> 02:56:51,764
Long have I desired<br/>to look upon the kings of old.

1674
02:56:51,765 --> 02:56:56,765
My kin.

1675
02:58:12,680 --> 02:58:15,139
We cross the lake at nightfall.

1676
02:58:15,140 --> 02:58:17,892
Hide the boats and continue on foot.

1677
02:58:17,893 --> 02:58:21,813
- We approach Mordor from the North.<br/>- Oh, yes?

1678
02:58:21,814 --> 02:58:25,817
Just a simple matter of finding<br/>our way through Emyn Muil...

1679
02:58:25,818 --> 02:58:29,237
...an impassable labyrinth<br/>of razor-sharp rocks.

1680
02:58:29,238 --> 02:58:32,740
And after that, it gets even better.

1681
02:58:32,741 --> 02:58:37,741
Festering, stinking marshland<br/>as far as the eye can see.

1682
02:58:37,871 --> 02:58:40,832
That is our road.

1683
02:58:40,833 --> 02:58:44,252
I suggest you take some rest<br/>and recover your strength, Master Dwarf.

1684
02:58:44,253 --> 02:58:49,007
Recover my--

1685
02:58:49,008 --> 02:58:51,175
- We should leave now.<br/>- No.

1686
02:58:51,176 --> 02:58:55,847
Orcs patrol the eastern shore.<br/>We must wait for cover of darkness.

1687
02:58:55,848 --> 02:58:59,517
It is not the eastern shore<br/>that worries me.

1688
02:58:59,518 --> 02:59:04,022
A shadow and a threat<br/>has been growing in my mind.

1689
02:59:04,023 --> 02:59:09,023
Something draws near.<br/>I can feel it.

1690
02:59:10,195 --> 02:59:15,195
Recover strength?<br/>Pay no heed to that, young Hobbit.

1691
02:59:15,659 --> 02:59:20,659
Where's Frodo?

1692
02:59:42,978 --> 02:59:46,272
BOROMIR:<br/>None of us should wander alone.

1693
02:59:46,273 --> 02:59:48,608
You, least of all.

1694
02:59:48,609 --> 02:59:52,111
So much depends on you.

1695
02:59:52,112 --> 02:59:57,112
Frodo?

1696
03:00:01,205 --> 03:00:04,457
I know why you seek solitude.

1697
03:00:04,458 --> 03:00:08,711
You suffer. I see it day by day.

1698
03:00:08,712 --> 03:00:13,299
You sure you do not suffer needlessly?

1699
03:00:13,300 --> 03:00:16,219
There are other ways, Frodo.

1700
03:00:16,220 --> 03:00:20,264
- Other paths that we might take.<br/>- I know what you would say.

1701
03:00:20,265 --> 03:00:24,268
It would seem like wisdom<br/>but for the warning in my heart.

1702
03:00:24,269 --> 03:00:27,522
Warning? Against what?

1703
03:00:27,523 --> 03:00:29,857
We're all afraid, Frodo.

1704
03:00:29,858 --> 03:00:33,736
But to let that fear drive us,<br/>to destroy what hope we have...

1705
03:00:33,737 --> 03:00:38,737
-...don't you see that is madness?<br/>- There is no other way.

1706
03:00:39,284 --> 03:00:44,163
I ask only for the strength<br/>to defend my people!

1707
03:00:44,164 --> 03:00:47,458

02:31:22,360 --> 02:31:24,446
Oh, Aragorn of the Dúnedain...

58
02:31:24,796 --> 02:31:26,496
...you are known to us.

59
02:31:39,403 --> 02:31:44,003
I spit upon your grave!

60
02:32:08,880 --> 02:32:14,558
We need your protection.
The road is fell!

61
02:32:14,560 --> 02:32:18,026
I wish we may come with you. 
Please, understand, we need your support!

62
02:32:33,025 --> 02:32:40,340
I wish we may come with you.
The road is very dangerous.

63
02:48:54,788 --> 02:48:56,860
You are being tracked.

64
02:50:49,319 --> 02:50:50,660
For her love...

65
02:50:51,543 --> 02:50:56,943
...I fear the grace of
Arwen Evenstar will diminish.

66
02:50:57,830 --> 02:51:02,330
I would have her leave these shores...

67
02:51:02,806 --> 02:51:06,006
...and be with her people.

68
02:51:07,480 --> 02:51:13,080
I would have her take
the ship to Valinor.

69
02:51:38,253 --> 02:51:39,018
Farewell.

70
02:51:43,619 --> 02:51:47,419
There is much you have yet to do.

71
02:51:49,071 --> 02:51:57,401
We shall not meet again, Elessar.

72
03:02:36,947 --> 03:02:40,447
They will fall.
