1
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:19,417
All her life she had wanted
to teach at Wellesley College.

2
00:01:19,587 --> 00:01:22,613
So when a position opened
in the Art History department...

3
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:26,521
...she pursued it single-mindedly
until she was hired.

4
00:01:32,233 --> 00:01:34,463
It was whispered
that Katherine Watson...

5
00:01:34,902 --> 00:01:37,166
...a first-year teacher
from Oakland State...

6
00:01:37,338 --> 00:01:40,569
...made up in brains
what she lacked in pedigree.

7
00:01:51,019 --> 00:01:53,681
Which was why this bohemian
from California...

8
00:01:53,855 --> 00:01:58,189
...was on her way to the most
conservative college in the nation.

9
00:01:58,359 --> 00:02:00,953
- Excuse me, please.
- Oh, sorry.

10
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:04,325
Excuse me.

11
00:02:08,836 --> 00:02:10,667
Excuse me. The bus?

12
00:02:10,838 --> 00:02:12,533
- Keep walking, ma'am.
- Thank you.

13
00:02:12,707 --> 00:02:16,473
But Katherine Watson didn't come
to Wellesley to fit in.

14
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:21,072
She came to Wellesley because
she wanted to make a difference.

15
00:02:21,249 --> 00:02:24,878
- Violet.
- My favorite Italian professor.

16
00:02:25,053 --> 00:02:27,021
- Nice summer?
- Terrific, thanks.

17
00:02:27,188 --> 00:02:29,349
- Who's that over there?
- Where?

18
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:34,188
Oh, Katherine Watson. New teacher.
Art History. I'm dying to meet her.

19
00:03:35,623 --> 00:03:38,490
Who knocks at the Door of Learning?

20
00:03:38,659 --> 00:03:43,221
- I am every woman.
- What do you seek?

21
00:03:43,397 --> 00:03:45,991
To awaken my spirit
through hard work...

22
00:03:46,167 --> 00:03:48,431
...and dedicate my life
to knowledge.

23
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:50,036
Then you are welcome.

24
00:03:50,204 --> 00:03:55,301
All women who seek to follow you
can enter here.

25
00:03:55,476 --> 00:04:00,209
I now declare
the academic year begun.

26
00:04:19,433 --> 00:04:23,961
A shame you didn't come yesterday.
It's so quiet before the girls arrive.

27
00:04:26,674 --> 00:04:30,041
Just a few rules.
No holes in the walls.

28
00:04:30,211 --> 00:04:34,841
No pets, no loud noises, no radio
or hi-fi after 8 on weekdays...

29
00:04:35,016 --> 00:04:36,711
...10 on weekends...

30
00:04:36,884 --> 00:04:40,342
...no hot plates and no male visitors.

31
00:04:42,757 --> 00:04:44,315
Anything wrong?

32
00:04:45,226 --> 00:04:48,787
I don't think I can go a year
without a hot plate.

33
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:55,892
Don't you just love chintz?

34
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:57,935
And look.

35
00:05:01,976 --> 00:05:03,773
They match.

36
00:05:03,945 --> 00:05:07,881
Sweet, right? Your room's here.

37
00:05:08,049 --> 00:05:12,076
My room is just across the way...

38
00:05:12,653 --> 00:05:15,349
...and Amanda Armstrong's
down the other end.

39
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:18,652
- You grew up here?
- My whole life.

40
00:05:18,826 --> 00:05:22,660
You'll meet my parents
when they come to visit.

41
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:26,129
- They visit?
- Regularly.

42
00:05:28,636 --> 00:05:34,302
- What do you teach?
- Speech, elocution and poise.

43
00:05:34,742 --> 00:05:37,176
Dinners are communal,
so I'll handle that.

44
00:05:37,345 --> 00:05:40,940
But breakfast and lunch,
you're on your own. So...

45
00:05:41,115 --> 00:05:46,178
...we each get our own shelf.
I'll make your label this evening.

46
00:05:46,621 --> 00:05:52,560
I don't need to tell you, everything on
our individual shelves is sacrosanct.

47
00:05:54,395 --> 00:05:58,058
I just knew when we met...

48
00:05:58,966 --> 00:06:01,366
...we'd be instant friends.

49
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:24,082
Be careful. They can smell fear.

50
00:06:44,412 --> 00:06:47,245
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

51
00:06:47,581 --> 00:06:49,242
Thank you.

52
00:06:49,984 --> 00:06:54,853
This is History of Art 100.

53
00:06:55,423 --> 00:06:59,450
We'll be following
Dr. Staunton's syllabus.

54
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:02,596
- Any questions so far?
- Your name?

55
00:07:03,597 --> 00:07:05,963
- Why don't you go first?
- Connie Baker.

56
00:07:06,133 --> 00:07:10,797
- Katherine Watson. Nice to meet you.
- Dr. Watson, I presume.

57
00:07:11,906 --> 00:07:15,137
- Not yet. And you are?
- Giselle Levy.

58
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:17,869
Giselle. If someone could get the...

59
00:07:19,146 --> 00:07:23,082
- Susan Delacorte.
- Thank you, Susan Delacorte.

60
00:07:26,587 --> 00:07:31,524
From the beginning, man has always
had the impulse to create art.

61
00:07:31,692 --> 00:07:35,128
- Can anyone tell me what this is?
- Wounded Bison, Altamira, Spain...

62
00:07:35,296 --> 00:07:38,561
...about 15,000 B.C.
Joan Brandwyn.

63
00:07:39,033 --> 00:07:40,933
Very good, Joan.

64
00:07:41,302 --> 00:07:45,295
Despite the age of these, they are
technically sophisticated because...

65
00:07:45,473 --> 00:07:49,967
The shading and the thickness of the
lines moving over the bison's hump.

66
00:07:50,144 --> 00:07:54,080
- Is that right?
- Yes, that's exactly right.

67
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:56,840
Next slide.

68
00:07:57,385 --> 00:08:01,446
This is probably less familiar.
It was discovered by archeologists...

69
00:08:01,622 --> 00:08:05,581
In 1879, Lascaux, France.
Dates back to 10,000 B.C.

70
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:10,060
Singled out because of flowing lines
depicting the movement of the animal.

71
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:14,929
- Impressive. Name?
- Herd of Horses.

72
00:08:15,102 --> 00:08:18,299
- I meant yours.
- We call her Flicka.

73
00:08:18,939 --> 00:08:21,703
Elizabeth Warren.
They call me Betty.

74
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:23,468
Very good.

75
00:08:23,644 --> 00:08:26,306
Betty is also correct.

76
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:30,382
Just because something is ancient
doesn't mean that it is primitive.

77
00:08:30,551 --> 00:08:32,781
For example. Next slide, please.

78
00:08:32,953 --> 00:08:35,444
Mycerinus and His Queen. 2470 B.C.

79
00:08:35,623 --> 00:08:38,114
It's a funerary statue
of the pharaoh and queen...

80
00:08:38,292 --> 00:08:42,592
...originally intended to preserve
the pharaoh's ka. Soul.

81
00:08:46,167 --> 00:08:49,102
Have any of you taken
Art History before?

82
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:51,500
No.

83
00:08:54,241 --> 00:08:56,835
Let's go on. Slide.

84
00:08:57,211 --> 00:09:00,112
Seated Scribe. Egypt. 2400 B.C.

85
00:09:01,048 --> 00:09:04,677
Peasant Couple Plowing.
Sixteenth century B.C. Egypt.

86
00:09:05,319 --> 00:09:08,413
Snake Goddess.
Minoan. 1600 B.C.

87
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:11,124
Fresco. Minoan. 1600 B.C.

88
00:09:12,026 --> 00:09:14,187
Funeral Mask. Mycenaean. 1200.

89
00:09:26,574 --> 00:09:27,939
Could someone please get...?

90
00:09:34,748 --> 00:09:36,409
Thank you.

91
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:41,353
By a show of hands only...

92
00:09:42,189 --> 00:09:46,353
...how many of you have read
the entire text?

93
00:09:48,829 --> 00:09:54,199
- And the suggested supplements.
- Long way from Oakland State?

94
00:09:57,638 --> 00:10:00,072
Well, you girls do prepare.

95
00:10:00,241 --> 00:10:04,007
If you've nothing else for us,
we could go to independent study.

96
00:10:04,912 --> 00:10:06,539
Ac...

97
00:10:43,284 --> 00:10:49,416
I was in California once. How do you
get work done with all that sunshine?

98
00:10:49,757 --> 00:10:53,386
- We tan in class.
- Really?

99
00:10:53,661 --> 00:10:54,958
No.

100
00:10:59,266 --> 00:11:01,860
You know, not everybody
wanted you.

101
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:04,527
I'm not naming any names.

102
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:09,301
These jobs usually go quickly.
Ex-students, friends of, you know...

103
00:11:09,476 --> 00:11:11,808
...the right people.

104
00:11:11,979 --> 00:11:15,915
The person they wanted took a job at
Brown, and no one else was available.

105
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:18,176
So here you are.

106
00:11:19,019 --> 00:11:22,819
You can go in now. Good luck.

107
00:11:28,829 --> 00:11:31,627
Your first class left a lot
to be desired, Miss Watson.

108
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:35,462
And I'm curious about the subject
of your dissertation.

109
00:11:35,636 --> 00:11:40,573
You suggest, "Picasso will do
for the 20th century...

110
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:44,700
...what Michelangelo did
for the Renaissance," unquote.

111
00:11:45,446 --> 00:11:47,914
In terms of influencing movements.

112
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:51,279
So these canvases that
they're turning out these days...

113
00:11:51,452 --> 00:11:54,512
...with paint dripped
and splotched on them...

114
00:11:54,688 --> 00:11:59,648
...they're as worthy of our attention
as Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel?

115
00:12:00,194 --> 00:12:01,991
I'm not comparing them.

116
00:12:02,162 --> 00:12:05,791
Have you ever seen
the Sistine Chapel, Miss Watson?

117
00:12:05,966 --> 00:12:07,957
Actually stood there?

118
00:12:09,603 --> 00:12:11,468
I've never been to Europe.

119
00:12:14,742 --> 00:12:19,543
I can assure all of you this is the place
I want to be more than anything.

120
00:12:19,713 --> 00:12:24,207
Better discipline next class,
Miss Watson.

121
00:12:29,556 --> 00:12:31,786
- Hello.
- It's me.

122
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:34,989
- Hey!
- Collect from Katherine Watson.

123
00:12:35,162 --> 00:12:38,723
- Will you accept?
- Yeah, sure, of course I will.

124
00:12:39,366 --> 00:12:41,561
Hey, is everything okay?

125
00:12:42,836 --> 00:12:43,825
Yeah.

126
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:46,731
Tough, huh?

127
00:12:49,843 --> 00:12:52,334
Well, how are the classes?

128
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,914
Snobs, right?

129
00:12:56,216 --> 00:13:00,312
- I hate to say I told you so.
- You don't have to.

130
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:08,987
I can't really talk right now.

131
00:13:10,197 --> 00:13:12,131
I'll write you tonight.

132
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:17,760
So you got a fella?

133
00:13:19,239 --> 00:13:22,470
He's... He's there. I'm here.

134
00:13:22,643 --> 00:13:28,104
Long distance. Torture. I know.
Come. Come in and sit down.

135
00:13:31,785 --> 00:13:35,949
When Lenny left for the South Pacific,
it nearly broke my heart.

136
00:13:36,123 --> 00:13:38,853
We wrote every day until...

137
00:13:41,528 --> 00:13:43,621
He was a great man.

138
00:13:44,431 --> 00:13:47,366
- I'm sorry.
- It was a hundred years ago.

139
00:13:47,534 --> 00:13:49,331
I'm babbling.

140
00:13:51,572 --> 00:13:56,600
I love Lucy.
Even if she is a communist.

141
00:13:56,777 --> 00:13:59,644
The only thing red about Lucy
is her hair.

142
00:13:59,813 --> 00:14:02,281
And even that's fake. Desi said it.

143
00:14:02,449 --> 00:14:04,383
Winchell wrote it.

144
00:14:05,152 --> 00:14:08,087
Amanda Armstrong.
I see you survived.

145
00:14:08,255 --> 00:14:10,120
Katherine Watson. Just barely.

146
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:13,418
Oh, good. You've met.
Katherine's taken the third bedroom.

147
00:14:13,594 --> 00:14:16,586
How about a little dinner
before What's My Line?

148
00:14:17,631 --> 00:14:20,156
How about a little drink?

149
00:14:22,536 --> 00:14:25,369
Her companion died in May.

150
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:27,237
Companion?

151
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:30,441
You know, companion.

152
00:14:31,578 --> 00:14:37,574
Josephine Burns.
Taught biology here for 30 years.

153
00:14:40,954 --> 00:14:44,082
You'll love it here, Katherine.
You'll see.

154
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:49,195
I already do. I... Honestly,
it's beautiful. It's perfect, really.

155
00:14:49,363 --> 00:14:53,925
Well, don't fool yourself. They have
claws underneath their white gloves.

156
00:14:55,235 --> 00:14:56,702
Who?

157
00:14:57,504 --> 00:15:02,032
The alumnae, their offspring,
the faculty. You name it.

158
00:15:02,409 --> 00:15:04,206
Watch out for yourself.

159
00:15:04,378 --> 00:15:06,437
Too much independence
frightens them.

160
00:15:06,613 --> 00:15:10,379
- Will you please stop?
- Oh, a word of advice.

161
00:15:10,551 --> 00:15:13,952
Don't let those girls
know that they got to you.

162
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:19,517
- They didn't.
- Good for you.

163
00:15:20,994 --> 00:15:23,258
You almost convinced me.

164
00:15:53,594 --> 00:15:56,529
- What is that?
- You tell me.

165
00:15:59,967 --> 00:16:03,801
Carcass by Soutine. 1925.

166
00:16:04,738 --> 00:16:08,230
- It's not on the syllabus.
- No, it's not.

167
00:16:10,244 --> 00:16:12,508
Is it any good?

168
00:16:17,751 --> 00:16:22,381
Come on, ladies.
There's no wrong answer.

169
00:16:22,556 --> 00:16:26,048
There's also no textbook
telling you what to think.

170
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:29,119
It's not that easy, is it?

171
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:32,562
All right. No. It's not good.

172
00:16:32,733 --> 00:16:35,531
In fact, I wouldn't even call it art.
It's grotesque.

173
00:16:35,736 --> 00:16:37,601
Is there a rule against
grotesque art?

174
00:16:37,804 --> 00:16:41,262
I think there's something
aggressive about it...

175
00:16:42,009 --> 00:16:45,172
...and erotic.
- To you, everything is erotic.

176
00:16:45,345 --> 00:16:47,745
- Everything is erotic.
- Girls.

177
00:16:47,915 --> 00:16:50,145
- Aren't there standards?
- Of course.

178
00:16:50,317 --> 00:16:53,684
Otherwise a tacky velvet painting
could be equated to a Rembrandt.

179
00:16:53,854 --> 00:16:58,052
My Uncle Ferdie has two tacky velvet
paintings. He loves those clowns.

180
00:16:58,225 --> 00:17:03,959
There are standards, technique,
composition, color, even subject.

181
00:17:04,131 --> 00:17:07,123
So if you're suggesting
that rotted side of meat is art...

182
00:17:07,301 --> 00:17:10,464
...much less good art,
then what are we going to learn?

183
00:17:11,638 --> 00:17:13,196
Just that.

184
00:17:13,373 --> 00:17:16,934
You have outlined our new syllabus,
Betty. Thank you.

185
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:20,011
What is art?
What makes it good or bad?

186
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:22,148
And who decides?

187
00:17:23,116 --> 00:17:24,583
Next slide, please.

188
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:29,680
Twenty-five years ago someone
thought this was brilliant.

189
00:17:29,856 --> 00:17:32,120
- I can see that.
- Who?

190
00:17:32,292 --> 00:17:35,819
My mother. I painted it
for her birthday.

191
00:17:35,996 --> 00:17:40,194
Next slide. This is my mom.

192
00:17:40,801 --> 00:17:44,100
- Is it art?
- It's a snapshot.

193
00:17:44,271 --> 00:17:48,207
If I told you Ansel Adams had taken it,
would that make a difference?

194
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:53,679
- Art isn't art until someone says it is.
- It's art!

195
00:17:54,948 --> 00:17:57,678
- The right people.
- Who are they?

196
00:17:57,884 --> 00:17:59,249
Betty Warren!

197
00:17:59,419 --> 00:18:02,980
- We're lucky we have one right here.
- Screw you.

198
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:07,157
Could you go back
to the Soutine, please?

199
00:18:09,496 --> 00:18:13,523
Just look at it again.
Look beyond the paint.

200
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:18,569
Let us try to open our minds
to a new idea.

201
00:18:21,508 --> 00:18:25,569
All right, back to chapter three.
Has anyone read it?

202
00:18:27,848 --> 00:18:28,872
Okay.

203
00:18:32,285 --> 00:18:35,220
"When your courses are set,
and a dream boat you've met...

204
00:18:35,389 --> 00:18:37,414
...have a real cigarette.
Have a Camel."

205
00:18:37,591 --> 00:18:41,618
I've got my courses, I've got my Camel
cigarette. Where is my dream boat?

206
00:18:41,795 --> 00:18:45,322
- Giselle, where is my dream boat?
- Betty's cousin isn't good enough?

207
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:47,524
- I haven't met him.
- Don't encourage her.

208
00:18:47,701 --> 00:18:50,261
He's only escorting
Connie as a favor.

209
00:18:50,437 --> 00:18:52,371
Why are you like this?

210
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:55,133
I didn't mean that.

211
00:18:55,308 --> 00:18:57,970
I'm just under so much pressure
with the wedding.

212
00:18:58,145 --> 00:19:01,114
Do you realize November 2
is three weeks from now?

213
00:19:01,281 --> 00:19:03,215
- Oh, honey.
- Don't have it.

214
00:19:03,383 --> 00:19:05,010
- Don't come.
- Here. Here.

215
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:08,382
I'm working on table seating now,
so I can just erase your name.

216
00:19:08,555 --> 00:19:09,817
- Can I see it?
- No.

217
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:12,015
Let me look.
I can't look for a second?

218
00:19:12,192 --> 00:19:15,593
- You want to see where Bill is sitting.
- No. That is over. Right?

219
00:19:15,762 --> 00:19:18,424
Right? Giselle, right?

220
00:19:20,434 --> 00:19:21,958
Damn it.

221
00:19:28,008 --> 00:19:31,466
- Do I look a little bit like her?
- Like who?

222
00:19:31,978 --> 00:19:35,436
- Katherine Watson.
- You mean, "crap is art"?

223
00:19:36,183 --> 00:19:40,449
- I think she's fabulous.
- Well, no man wanted her.

224
00:19:41,855 --> 00:19:44,016
- She isn't dead.
- She's at least 30.

225
00:19:44,191 --> 00:19:47,251
- Oh, no. No.
- I guess she never wanted children.

226
00:19:47,427 --> 00:19:49,361
For your information...

227
00:19:49,529 --> 00:19:55,559
...Katherine Watson had to take
this job to escape from California.

228
00:19:56,269 --> 00:19:57,531
Please.

229
00:19:57,704 --> 00:20:01,606
She had a torrid affair
with a Hollywood movie star.

230
00:20:01,775 --> 00:20:06,109
- She came here to get away.
- That's ridiculous.

231
00:20:06,279 --> 00:20:09,009
- Who was it?
- I don't know.

232
00:20:09,483 --> 00:20:12,077
Who was it, Giselle?
Don't be a pimple! Tell me!

233
00:20:12,252 --> 00:20:14,948
- It's ridiculous.
- Tell me. No, it's not. You know.

234
00:20:15,122 --> 00:20:18,751
- You know something. Tell me.
- It's William Holden.

235
00:20:20,227 --> 00:20:21,956
- Fantastic!
- I know.

236
00:20:22,129 --> 00:20:23,756
Who is it?

237
00:20:24,664 --> 00:20:27,132
William Holden.

238
00:20:35,675 --> 00:20:39,839
I know. I know. I'm late. I'm... Abject
pleading, apologies, forgiveness.

239
00:20:40,147 --> 00:20:41,671
Is she giving you any trouble?

240
00:20:41,848 --> 00:20:45,545
If these girls can't get back on time,
know what I say? Lock them out.

241
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:51,246
Come on. Out! I'm going
to lock the door. Out!

242
00:20:51,525 --> 00:20:56,827
Bedtime, ladies. Bedtime.
Let's go. Bedtime.

243
00:20:57,397 --> 00:20:59,524
- Hey, Betty.
- Quiet time, ladies.

244
00:20:59,699 --> 00:21:02,133
Women like Katherine Watson
don't get married...

245
00:21:02,302 --> 00:21:05,328
...because they choose not to.
- No woman chooses to live...

246
00:21:05,505 --> 00:21:08,941
...without a home, unless she's
sleeping with her Italian professor.

247
00:21:09,109 --> 00:21:11,270
- You are so critical.
- I am not.

248
00:21:11,444 --> 00:21:13,935
Of course you are.
You're your mother's daughter.

249
00:21:14,114 --> 00:21:15,877
It's a classic Electra complex.

250
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:18,647
I don't blame you. I mean...

251
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:20,980
...who wouldn't want
to murder your mother?

252
00:21:21,154 --> 00:21:24,351
- Hey. How's the Harvard sweetheart?
- Divine.

253
00:21:24,524 --> 00:21:26,617
Got an extra ciggie?

254
00:21:26,793 --> 00:21:28,624
- Did you do his homework?
- Of course.

255
00:21:28,795 --> 00:21:31,764
- Want to do mine?
- No.

256
00:21:34,367 --> 00:21:38,827
This isn't what I think it is. Is it?

257
00:21:41,141 --> 00:21:42,403
Where'd you get it?

258
00:21:44,911 --> 00:21:46,640
From the school nurse.

259
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:52,213
- It's against the law.
- Oh, honey. It's a girl's best friend.

260
00:21:52,385 --> 00:21:56,879
- A certain kind of girl.
- Meet the last virgin bride.

261
00:21:58,225 --> 00:22:02,286
- Spencer is a gentleman.
- And even gentlemen have dicks.

262
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:09,525
- Maybe I'll get one.
- What? A dick?

263
00:22:09,703 --> 00:22:11,933
Don't be stupid, Connie.

264
00:22:14,808 --> 00:22:17,800
Someone, somewhere,
someday might be interested.

265
00:22:19,079 --> 00:22:23,106
Just in case.
Just in case, I'll be prepared.

266
00:22:26,586 --> 00:22:28,577
Was that necessary?

267
00:22:28,755 --> 00:22:31,019
I was taught it's best
to speak honestly.

268
00:22:31,191 --> 00:22:34,058
Okay. You're a bitch.

269
00:22:41,101 --> 00:22:43,763
We recently learned
that Amanda Armstrong...

270
00:22:43,937 --> 00:22:48,897
...our nurse, has been distributing
contraception to Wellesley girls.

271
00:22:49,075 --> 00:22:51,839
This revelation is disturbing
to an institution...

272
00:22:52,012 --> 00:22:54,640
...that prides itself on propriety.

273
00:23:05,525 --> 00:23:10,690
Go, go, go! Go, go!
It's been going on since the late '80s.

274
00:23:10,864 --> 00:23:14,595
- Whoever wins is first to marry!
- Do the girls take it literally?

275
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:19,603
Only the girl with the winning hoop.
Oh, look, it's Phyllis Nayor!

276
00:23:22,075 --> 00:23:26,671
Good for her. It gets me every time.

277
00:23:26,846 --> 00:23:29,440
- Why the buggies?
- They've got their man.

278
00:23:29,616 --> 00:23:32,107
They're wishing for their babies.

279
00:23:36,122 --> 00:23:38,249
Have you seen this?

280
00:23:39,392 --> 00:23:40,825
What is it?

281
00:23:41,594 --> 00:23:46,224
It's a front-page attack on Amanda
Armstrong. Betty Warren wrote it.

282
00:23:52,906 --> 00:23:55,875
"By providing contraception
on demand, our school nurse...

283
00:23:56,042 --> 00:23:59,102
...is little more than a cheerleader
for promiscuity." Wow.

284
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:02,578
Oh, they're not going to dump her
in a lake!

285
00:24:04,784 --> 00:24:06,979
- I'm coming, Phyllis!
- Have you seen this?

286
00:24:07,153 --> 00:24:10,350
I wouldn't worry. Betty's just
a young girl flexing her muscles.

287
00:24:10,523 --> 00:24:13,321
So was Lizzie Borden,
and her mother wasn't president...

288
00:24:13,493 --> 00:24:17,259
...of the alumnae association.
- Would somebody get that girl a towel!

289
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:20,524
- That's her mother?
- Apple, tree.

290
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,861
Is Amanda going to get into trouble?

291
00:24:23,036 --> 00:24:25,903
Amanda needs to start
minding her p's and q's.

292
00:24:26,072 --> 00:24:29,007
The trick to surviving Wellesley
is never getting noticed.

293
00:24:29,175 --> 00:24:31,234
Ciao, Mona Lisa.

294
00:24:31,945 --> 00:24:34,345
The big war hero.

295
00:24:34,514 --> 00:24:36,982
He thinks he's something special.

296
00:24:38,184 --> 00:24:40,914
He sleeps with his students.

297
00:24:43,223 --> 00:24:45,589
The gold is fine.
The napkin rings are vulgar.

298
00:24:45,759 --> 00:24:48,057
The glassware should be trimmed
with gold.

299
00:24:48,228 --> 00:24:52,688
The little sugar boxes, gold and white,
filled with chocolate. No candlesticks.

300
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:55,733
- Freesia instead of daisies.
- Wise choice, madam.

301
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:58,503
No baby's breath.

302
00:25:03,777 --> 00:25:07,110
- You already had your fitting?
- We're on our way.

303
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:10,841
Here's the seating chart
and Spencer's list of groomsmen.

304
00:25:11,017 --> 00:25:13,076
Oh, I almost forgot.

305
00:25:13,453 --> 00:25:17,787
I spoke to him about reading the
poem. He'd rather not. I said all right.

306
00:25:19,426 --> 00:25:21,894
Excuse us for a second, Joan.

307
00:25:27,233 --> 00:25:30,566
A good wife lets her husband
think that everything's his idea...

308
00:25:30,737 --> 00:25:33,399
...even when it's not.
- I don't care if he reads it.

309
00:25:33,573 --> 00:25:35,632
You will in retrospect.

310
00:25:36,943 --> 00:25:42,347
Now, why don't you see if you
can't nudge the idea into his head.

311
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:51,488
I've been here now
for 21 years, Jocelyn.

312
00:25:51,658 --> 00:25:54,786
- I remember you as a student.
- Twenty-four, if you count that.

313
00:25:54,961 --> 00:25:56,986
So why the theatrics?

314
00:25:57,430 --> 00:26:01,594
We cannot appear
to promote sexual promiscuity.

315
00:26:01,768 --> 00:26:05,135
Okay. It's about appearances, then?
No.

316
00:26:05,305 --> 00:26:07,569
All right, all right.

317
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:12,609
All right. Well, I promise not to appear
to be sympathetic, progressive...

318
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:16,408
...or what did Mrs. Warren
call it? "Liberal."

319
00:26:16,983 --> 00:26:18,848
Scout's honor.

320
00:26:20,286 --> 00:26:23,722
I spent the better part of Friday
afternoon convincing the alumnae...

321
00:26:23,890 --> 00:26:25,790
...that your record was impeccable...

322
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:30,191
...that you would no longer
provide contraceptive devices...

323
00:26:30,363 --> 00:26:33,025
...and you'd make
a public statement to that effect.

324
00:26:33,199 --> 00:26:35,326
I'm not willing to make
a public statement.

325
00:26:35,502 --> 00:26:37,834
It doesn't matter, Amanda.

326
00:26:40,306 --> 00:26:42,365
They're letting you go.

327
00:26:45,645 --> 00:26:47,840
It's out of my hands.

328
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:53,449
And this champagne cup
is in the wrong place.

329
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:57,283
And up and down. And up and...

330
00:26:57,457 --> 00:26:59,982
Katherine. Good evening,
Miss Watson.

331
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,492
- Good evening, Miss Watson.
- Join us.

332
00:27:06,432 --> 00:27:07,763
No.

333
00:27:07,934 --> 00:27:10,459
- Good night, Miss Watson.
- Good night, Miss Watson.

334
00:27:10,637 --> 00:27:12,867
And down. Very nice. Very nice.

335
00:27:28,855 --> 00:27:30,322
Hey.

336
00:27:32,125 --> 00:27:35,526
Heard about Amanda. I'm sorry.

337
00:27:35,695 --> 00:27:38,755
She seemed all right about it.
I wouldn't be.

338
00:27:38,932 --> 00:27:41,366
They don't give you
too many chances around here.

339
00:27:41,534 --> 00:27:44,435
Oh, that depends how much
they hate you to begin with.

340
00:27:46,406 --> 00:27:48,897
Can I buy you a drink?
Or are you here for dinner?

341
00:27:49,075 --> 00:27:51,475
How long do
the marriage lectures take?

342
00:27:51,644 --> 00:27:53,805
Get this woman a booth.

343
00:28:08,494 --> 00:28:11,725
Your husband is at a crossroads
in his career.

344
00:28:12,599 --> 00:28:18,936
He's competing for promotion
against two rivals, Smith and Jones.

345
00:28:19,973 --> 00:28:24,603
To get the edge, you have wisely
decided to invite the boss...

346
00:28:24,777 --> 00:28:27,803
...and his wife to a 7:00 dinner.

347
00:28:27,981 --> 00:28:30,711
You've carefully planned
your meal...

348
00:28:30,883 --> 00:28:34,182
...set your table
and arranged for a babysitter.

349
00:28:34,354 --> 00:28:37,323
- Oh, we have babies!
- Yes, and I have twins!

350
00:28:39,359 --> 00:28:42,123
Then, surprise. It's 6:15...

351
00:28:42,295 --> 00:28:46,823
...and your husband's called to say
that Smith, Jones and their wives...

352
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,628
...have been invited
at the boss's request.

353
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:55,898
Ever the Wellesley girl...

354
00:28:56,075 --> 00:28:58,600
...you keep your cool
and understand...

355
00:28:58,778 --> 00:29:03,238
...that the boss is probably testing you
as much as your husband. What next?

356
00:29:03,416 --> 00:29:06,476
- Yes?
- File for divorce?

357
00:29:08,888 --> 00:29:11,322
That's very funny.

358
00:29:11,491 --> 00:29:14,392
But the thing is, it's not a joke.

359
00:29:15,061 --> 00:29:17,621
A few years from now
your sole responsibility...

360
00:29:17,797 --> 00:29:21,324
...will be taking care
of your husband and children.

361
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:27,239
You may all be here...

362
00:29:27,407 --> 00:29:29,466
...for an easy A...

363
00:29:29,642 --> 00:29:34,705
...but the grade that matters the most
is the one he gives you, not me.

364
00:29:35,448 --> 00:29:38,542
- You'll need to...
- Whatever you do...

365
00:29:38,718 --> 00:29:41,152
...don't put the boss's wife
next to your husband.

366
00:29:41,321 --> 00:29:45,052
- Why not?
- She's screwing him.

367
00:29:46,359 --> 00:29:49,795
Is that where you learned
to speak Italian? In Italy?

368
00:29:49,962 --> 00:29:51,429
Yeah.

369
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:57,330
- Have you got a boyfriend?
- Yes.

370
00:29:59,639 --> 00:30:02,073
You know, if you were mine,
I'd never let you go.

371
00:30:02,241 --> 00:30:04,607
I wouldn't have asked
your permission.

372
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:08,840
Yeah, they say you're progressive.

373
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:11,146
A forward thinker.

374
00:30:12,051 --> 00:30:14,781
- Are you?
- There are a lot of labels here...

375
00:30:15,221 --> 00:30:16,688
...l've noticed.

376
00:30:16,856 --> 00:30:22,692
Right family, right school, right art,
right way of thinking.

377
00:30:23,162 --> 00:30:25,687
Well, saves the effort
on thinking for yourself.

378
00:30:26,866 --> 00:30:30,302
How do you expect to ever make
a difference if everything is a joke?

379
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:35,400
Oh, Katherine Watson comes to
Wellesley to set us all free? Come on.

380
00:30:37,643 --> 00:30:41,909
- Thank you for the drink.
- No, no. Wait. I was teasing.

381
00:30:42,715 --> 00:30:45,149
They have their own way
of doing things here.

382
00:30:45,451 --> 00:30:49,785
You've just gotta find a way
to work with them. We all had to.

383
00:31:01,334 --> 00:31:03,199
I'm sorry.

384
00:31:05,271 --> 00:31:08,434
Five years ago,
they'd have slapped my wrist.

385
00:31:08,608 --> 00:31:12,738
But now there's a committee
for the protection of everything.

386
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:16,411
They think you're dangerous?

387
00:31:16,582 --> 00:31:20,780
Oh, no, darling. No. Subversive.

388
00:31:22,922 --> 00:31:24,321
It's gotten to the point...

389
00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:27,891
...where you don't know
who is protecting whom from what.

390
00:31:28,561 --> 00:31:35,023
Or should that be "from whom"?
Well, whom gives a damn anyway?

391
00:31:35,568 --> 00:31:38,264
They're doing me a favor really.

392
00:31:40,573 --> 00:31:42,268
Will you be all right?

393
00:31:45,845 --> 00:31:47,779
Better than that.

394
00:31:51,951 --> 00:31:56,615
I should really have left
when Josephine died.

395
00:31:59,659 --> 00:32:02,992
Nothing left to love
here anymore. So...

396
00:32:17,477 --> 00:32:19,411
Hello?

397
00:32:20,646 --> 00:32:23,547
- Miss Watson?
- Yes. I'm back here.

398
00:32:25,151 --> 00:32:29,679
I've never been to this part
of campus before. Where are we?

399
00:32:30,523 --> 00:32:34,755
No man's land. So to speak.

400
00:32:37,563 --> 00:32:39,292
Come on in.

401
00:32:40,099 --> 00:32:41,726
What's all this?

402
00:32:42,435 --> 00:32:44,596
Different things different days.

403
00:32:44,770 --> 00:32:51,141
People who inspire me,
artists I admire, editorials I don't.

404
00:32:51,444 --> 00:32:54,743
So you came to see me.

405
00:32:55,615 --> 00:32:58,607
- You gave me a C.
- I'm kind.

406
00:32:58,985 --> 00:33:01,783
The assignment was to write
about Bruegel. I did that.

407
00:33:02,255 --> 00:33:05,782
- No, what you did was copy Strauss.
- I was referencing an expert.

408
00:33:06,325 --> 00:33:09,954
If I wanted to know what he thought,
I'd buy his book.

409
00:33:13,432 --> 00:33:16,128
Miss Watson, with all due respect...

410
00:33:17,937 --> 00:33:20,201
Bruegel was a storyteller.
Find the stories.

411
00:33:20,373 --> 00:33:24,434
Break them down into smaller pieces.
You might actually enjoy it.

412
00:33:25,411 --> 00:33:29,404
- You're giving me another chance?
- So it seems.

413
00:33:31,517 --> 00:33:34,543
Is that my file? What's it say?

414
00:33:36,622 --> 00:33:38,385
Well, let's see.

415
00:33:39,992 --> 00:33:43,086
- Straight A's.
- Until now.

416
00:33:44,363 --> 00:33:48,026
President of the poetry society,
captain of the debate team...

417
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:51,897
...co-captain of the tennis club,
founder of the horticulture league.

418
00:33:52,071 --> 00:33:56,508
- I sound like a pompous ass.
- Yes, you do, but a very busy one.

419
00:33:56,676 --> 00:34:01,511
And it says here that you're pre-law.
What law school are you gonna go to?

420
00:34:01,681 --> 00:34:05,447
I hadn't thought about that.
After I graduate, I'm getting married.

421
00:34:05,618 --> 00:34:09,418
- And then?
- And then I'll be married.

422
00:34:10,222 --> 00:34:11,519
You can do both.

423
00:34:11,824 --> 00:34:16,625
Just for fun, if you could go
to any law school, which would it be?

424
00:34:17,396 --> 00:34:18,988
Yale.

425
00:34:19,699 --> 00:34:20,893
Yale.

426
00:34:21,067 --> 00:34:25,970
They keep five slots open for women,
one unofficially for a Wellesley girl.

427
00:34:26,138 --> 00:34:28,971
But you haven't really
thought about it.

428
00:34:46,559 --> 00:34:50,962
Wake up, Joanie, wake up.
Wake up.

429
00:34:51,897 --> 00:34:53,228
Okay, don't get up.

430
00:34:53,399 --> 00:34:56,300
Don't hear what I have to say
about Tommy and Spencer...

431
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:59,734
...looking at an engagement ring...

432
00:34:59,905 --> 00:35:01,338
...for you.

433
00:35:03,075 --> 00:35:04,565
You're sure?

434
00:35:04,744 --> 00:35:06,974
That's everything
we always wanted, huh?

435
00:35:07,146 --> 00:35:10,604
We'll be best friends, and our
husbands will be best friends...

436
00:35:10,783 --> 00:35:14,150
...and we'll have houses together
and we'll have babies together...

437
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,413
...and they'll be best friends.

438
00:35:16,589 --> 00:35:19,615
You're going to be
Mrs. Tommy Donegal.

439
00:35:19,992 --> 00:35:21,084
When?

440
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:25,560
I'll get the scoop tomorrow.
You go back to sleep.

441
00:35:26,565 --> 00:35:30,524
The first part of the exam
will consist of two pairs of slides.

442
00:35:30,703 --> 00:35:34,799
Please identify each of the slides
by name, period and date.

443
00:35:34,974 --> 00:35:36,942
Then compare and contrast them.

444
00:35:37,109 --> 00:35:39,475
You will have 10 minutes
for each pair.

445
00:35:39,645 --> 00:35:42,011
Then you will write
a 1500-word essay...

446
00:35:42,181 --> 00:35:46,515
...describing the stylistic differences
between Raphael and van Eyck.

447
00:35:47,086 --> 00:35:49,350
Eyes forward, Miss Delacorte.

448
00:35:50,122 --> 00:35:52,249
You have 40 minutes.

449
00:35:52,425 --> 00:35:53,915
Good luck.

450
00:36:10,776 --> 00:36:13,142
- Excuse me.
- Governor. Another shot, please.

451
00:36:15,848 --> 00:36:18,214
This way, please. Thank you.

452
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:39,035
Excuse me.

453
00:36:45,644 --> 00:36:48,044
This is quite the event.

454
00:36:48,214 --> 00:36:52,150
- I'm surprised I was invited.
- Well, look around you.

455
00:36:52,318 --> 00:36:53,945
Who wasn't?

456
00:36:58,624 --> 00:37:01,616
You ever hear the expression
"Keeping up with the Joneses"?

457
00:37:01,794 --> 00:37:03,022
Of course.

458
00:37:03,195 --> 00:37:04,958
Mr. And Mrs. Gordon Jones.

459
00:37:05,131 --> 00:37:09,363
The actual, historical family
they invented the phrase about.

460
00:37:11,804 --> 00:37:13,431
Good to know.

461
00:37:36,295 --> 00:37:37,592
That's him!

462
00:38:21,207 --> 00:38:24,301
- Thank you.
- Good to see you.

463
00:38:25,477 --> 00:38:28,207
- Thank you very much.
- A beautiful dress.

464
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:30,746
Hi, we're so glad you came.

465
00:38:30,916 --> 00:38:33,578
- We're together. Table 19.
- Good.

466
00:38:35,354 --> 00:38:37,322
Holy God!

467
00:38:37,489 --> 00:38:41,186
The governor is right behind you.
Don't turn around.

468
00:38:44,363 --> 00:38:46,058
Great band.

469
00:38:49,001 --> 00:38:50,525
- Violet.
- Yes?

470
00:38:50,703 --> 00:38:52,864
- Would you mind if I go here?
- Not at all.

471
00:38:53,038 --> 00:38:54,733
Over here. Thank you.

472
00:38:57,443 --> 00:39:00,776
- Great band.
- Great band.

473
00:39:01,113 --> 00:39:03,581
- Hi, Katherine.
- Hi, Professor Dunbar.

474
00:39:06,919 --> 00:39:08,853
I'm getting a Manhattan.
Like anything?

475
00:39:09,021 --> 00:39:10,750
No, thank you.

476
00:39:10,923 --> 00:39:13,187
I'll take a Jack and ginger.

477
00:39:16,262 --> 00:39:18,423
He's making his move.

478
00:39:20,799 --> 00:39:23,267
I knew he'd go for her.

479
00:39:23,435 --> 00:39:25,835
She's too old for him.

480
00:39:26,005 --> 00:39:28,235
She's too smart for him.

481
00:39:28,407 --> 00:39:29,669
Hold that.

482
00:39:41,387 --> 00:39:43,446
- They're playing our song.
- What?

483
00:39:43,622 --> 00:39:46,887
- They're playing our song.
- I heard you.

484
00:39:47,059 --> 00:39:50,085
- Hi.
- Hi, Giselle.

485
00:39:52,731 --> 00:39:54,596
- Ladies' choice?
- Sure.

486
00:39:55,901 --> 00:39:57,493
Excuse me.

487
00:40:05,778 --> 00:40:09,373
Ladies, gentlemen! Quiet!

488
00:40:10,149 --> 00:40:12,640
What's this about the poem
you wanted me to read?

489
00:40:12,818 --> 00:40:15,810
- It was your idea, remember?
- I never said that.

490
00:40:15,988 --> 00:40:17,512
Ready?

491
00:40:19,325 --> 00:40:20,314
Excellent.

492
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:25,597
Well, I wrote this down, just in case
you forgot. It's my favorite.

493
00:40:26,332 --> 00:40:27,890
Smile.

494
00:40:33,973 --> 00:40:38,672
Now, Betty, I tried to think of
a million ways to tell you how I feel.

495
00:40:38,844 --> 00:40:40,937
But instead...

496
00:40:41,714 --> 00:40:44,410
...I refer to your favorite poem.

497
00:40:54,193 --> 00:40:56,957
- Good catch.
- You said it.

498
00:40:59,198 --> 00:41:01,359
He's a morsel. Miss Watson!

499
00:41:01,533 --> 00:41:04,229
- He's a favor. Remember?
- Come on.

500
00:41:04,403 --> 00:41:07,395
Miss Watson,
I want you to meet Tommy.

501
00:41:07,573 --> 00:41:09,700
Tommy, come here for a second.

502
00:41:11,243 --> 00:41:13,837
You are so beautiful.

503
00:41:14,413 --> 00:41:18,179
- This is Katherine Watson.
- Oh, wow! In the flesh.

504
00:41:18,350 --> 00:41:22,047
- She has not shut up about you.
- Oh, stop.

505
00:41:22,221 --> 00:41:24,815
- You know what I'm saying?
- I do.

506
00:41:24,990 --> 00:41:28,721
- You did something to impress her.
- Well, it seems you did too.

507
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:35,990
- You make these especially well.
- Thank you.

508
00:41:36,735 --> 00:41:39,568
I had a fella. Lenny.

509
00:41:40,639 --> 00:41:45,201
You remind me of him so much.

510
00:41:46,712 --> 00:41:48,475
He had this...

511
00:41:49,048 --> 00:41:52,108
...funny little thing
where his two front teeth...

512
00:41:52,284 --> 00:41:54,343
...they overlapped.

513
00:41:57,156 --> 00:41:58,783
He's dead.

514
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:03,218
South Pacific.

515
00:42:23,248 --> 00:42:26,376
My parents say my future
is right on the horizon.

516
00:42:26,552 --> 00:42:28,918
Tell them the horizon
is an imaginary line...

517
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:31,147
...that recedes as you approach it.

518
00:42:33,959 --> 00:42:36,519
I think I'll go back to my seat.

519
00:42:36,695 --> 00:42:39,721
I had a really nice time. Thank you.

520
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,531
Connie.

521
00:42:43,502 --> 00:42:46,335
- Is this the brushoff?
- No.

522
00:42:46,505 --> 00:42:48,871
I thought you were, you know...

523
00:42:49,041 --> 00:42:51,009
...done with me.

524
00:42:52,444 --> 00:42:56,881
- Why would you think that?
- Betty said that you...

525
00:42:57,049 --> 00:43:02,453
I don't wanna take advantage.
I know that this was some favor.

526
00:43:02,621 --> 00:43:05,886
She did me the favor, not you.

527
00:43:06,825 --> 00:43:08,986
Come on, dance with me.

528
00:43:39,057 --> 00:43:41,355
She's too good for you.

529
00:43:42,961 --> 00:43:44,690
Maybe you're right.

530
00:43:46,265 --> 00:43:49,132
I'm too good for you too.

531
00:43:50,068 --> 00:43:55,131
- But I have lower expectations.
- I thought we settled this last spring.

532
00:43:55,507 --> 00:43:59,876
So then we probably shouldn't have
slept together over the summer.

533
00:44:00,212 --> 00:44:01,702
Stop.

534
00:44:05,184 --> 00:44:06,708
You ready?

535
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:10,054
Do you wanna know something funny?

536
00:44:10,222 --> 00:44:12,782
Lenny's not dead.

537
00:44:13,258 --> 00:44:15,920
Not technically.

538
00:44:16,094 --> 00:44:17,391
He...

539
00:44:17,563 --> 00:44:19,053
He's got married.

540
00:44:19,231 --> 00:44:22,462
He's got a wife and kids...

541
00:44:23,035 --> 00:44:24,559
...and a mortgage.

542
00:44:24,736 --> 00:44:28,467
It was all supposed to be mine,
except for the wife.

543
00:44:30,409 --> 00:44:34,311
And you...
You don't look a thing like him.

544
00:44:34,479 --> 00:44:36,276
- You ugly bartender.
- Stop it.

545
00:44:36,448 --> 00:44:40,248
- You couldn't shine his shoes.
- I'm sorry.

546
00:44:40,419 --> 00:44:43,115
It wasn't supposed
to turn out like this.

547
00:44:43,288 --> 00:44:46,587
It wasn't supposed
to turn out like this.

548
00:44:47,626 --> 00:44:50,618
- Which way?
- Let me just see here.

549
00:44:50,796 --> 00:44:52,730
I'm not sure.

550
00:44:53,298 --> 00:44:56,563
- Where are we supposed to go?
- I think it's here.

551
00:44:56,735 --> 00:44:58,965
Come this way. We're almost there.

552
00:45:12,985 --> 00:45:14,316
Joe.

553
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:17,320
- Hello.
- Hi. How are you?

554
00:45:17,489 --> 00:45:19,889
Great. Thank you so much for this.
You're a pal.

555
00:45:20,058 --> 00:45:22,117
It's a pleasure.
Your timing is perfect.

556
00:45:24,463 --> 00:45:26,328
There it is.

557
00:45:59,197 --> 00:46:02,428
- That's Jackson Pollock.
- In a word.

558
00:46:02,601 --> 00:46:07,038
I was getting used to the idea of dead,
maggoty meat being art, now this.

559
00:46:08,006 --> 00:46:11,032
Please don't tell me
we have to write a paper about it.

560
00:46:11,209 --> 00:46:12,642
Do me a favor.

561
00:46:12,811 --> 00:46:16,212
Do yourselves a favor.
Stop talking and look.

562
00:46:16,815 --> 00:46:21,843
You're not required to write a paper.
You're not even required to like it.

563
00:46:22,020 --> 00:46:24,284
You are required...

564
00:46:24,456 --> 00:46:26,151
...to consider it.

565
00:46:26,325 --> 00:46:31,024
That's your only assignment today.
When you're done, you may leave.

566
00:46:33,432 --> 00:46:36,128
Thank God Betty isn't here.

567
00:47:31,990 --> 00:47:34,049
Where did you come from?

568
00:47:34,226 --> 00:47:35,818
Mars.

569
00:47:37,095 --> 00:47:39,256
What a coincidence.

570
00:47:40,265 --> 00:47:46,226
Tom Donegal came by to see Joan.
So I hopped a ride.

571
00:47:46,605 --> 00:47:48,266
Why?

572
00:47:50,809 --> 00:47:52,902
So I could do this:

573
00:48:08,994 --> 00:48:11,224
- Katherine.
- Yes?

574
00:48:11,863 --> 00:48:13,831
- Have you got a minute?
- Of course.

575
00:48:13,999 --> 00:48:15,557
Walk with me.

576
00:48:16,334 --> 00:48:18,734
- You going home for the holidays?
- No.

577
00:48:18,904 --> 00:48:20,667
- Too far?
- Too expensive.

578
00:48:20,839 --> 00:48:23,364
But I've never had
a New England Christmas, so...

579
00:48:23,542 --> 00:48:27,273
- Our weather hasn't scared you away?
- I love it here.

580
00:48:27,446 --> 00:48:28,777
Do you?

581
00:48:29,147 --> 00:48:33,106
I've been getting some calls about
your teaching methods, Katherine.

582
00:48:33,285 --> 00:48:36,777
They're a little unorthodox...

583
00:48:36,955 --> 00:48:39,048
...for Wellesley.

584
00:48:39,224 --> 00:48:42,557
- We are traditionalists, Katherine.
- Yes, I noticed.

585
00:48:42,727 --> 00:48:45,252
So if you'd like to stay here...

586
00:48:45,430 --> 00:48:48,593
- Is that a question?
- More a discussion.

587
00:48:48,767 --> 00:48:53,136
- About my staying here?
- You'll have your formal review in May.

588
00:48:53,839 --> 00:48:55,807
Until then...

589
00:48:56,341 --> 00:48:59,606
...a little less modern art.

590
00:48:59,778 --> 00:49:01,678
Happy holidays.

591
00:49:01,847 --> 00:49:03,474
And to you.

592
00:49:09,621 --> 00:49:12,021
- Afternoon.
- Oh, hi...

593
00:49:16,828 --> 00:49:19,296
I hope you get that ring!

594
00:49:19,631 --> 00:49:23,260
Bye, girls, see you next year.
Have a safe trip.

595
00:49:31,376 --> 00:49:34,470
So, what's the big hush-hush secret?

596
00:49:34,646 --> 00:49:38,013
Are we gonna hear the pitter-patter
of little Spencers?

597
00:49:38,183 --> 00:49:40,413
Stop. They'll tell us
when they're ready.

598
00:49:40,585 --> 00:49:42,212
Are you ready?

599
00:49:42,387 --> 00:49:46,084
Is she the cutest? You are the cutest.
Come here, you.

600
00:49:50,996 --> 00:49:53,965
Spencer's been made junior partner.

601
00:49:54,833 --> 00:49:58,929
- It is about time.
- And it's a significant raise too!

602
00:49:59,104 --> 00:50:02,073
- Betty!
- What? I can say that, can't I?

603
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:04,140
To Tommy and Joan?

604
00:50:04,309 --> 00:50:09,747
Well, it is.
So maybe a family isn't far behind.

605
00:50:10,849 --> 00:50:13,511
Let's take our coffee
in the sitting room, shall we?

606
00:50:13,685 --> 00:50:14,674
I'll help.

607
00:50:18,290 --> 00:50:21,453
- Keep them closed.
- All right.

608
00:50:26,364 --> 00:50:29,697
Beautiful! You've got everything
you've ever dreamed of.

609
00:50:29,868 --> 00:50:31,631
You will too.

610
00:50:32,704 --> 00:50:37,038
I've got a secret to tell you.
You swear you won't gab to anyone?

611
00:50:37,609 --> 00:50:40,737
I got accepted early
to Yale Law School.

612
00:50:40,912 --> 00:50:45,315
To what?! Why?!
You don't want to be a lawyer.

613
00:50:45,483 --> 00:50:47,246
Maybe I do.

614
00:50:47,552 --> 00:50:51,784
You won't switch cold creams without
asking me, but you applied to school?

615
00:50:51,957 --> 00:50:54,721
On a lark.
We never thought I'd get in.

616
00:50:54,893 --> 00:50:56,884
- Who's "we"?
- Miss Watson.

617
00:50:57,062 --> 00:51:00,225
She practically filled out
my application for me.

618
00:51:00,799 --> 00:51:03,734
You've got to be kidding me!
What right does she have?

619
00:51:03,902 --> 00:51:05,494
You're getting married!

620
00:51:05,670 --> 00:51:08,537
First of all,
there's no ring on this finger.

621
00:51:08,707 --> 00:51:12,199
Second, I can do both. I can.

622
00:51:12,744 --> 00:51:16,111
- How does Tommy feel about this?
- He doesn't know. No one does.

623
00:51:16,281 --> 00:51:19,307
- Not even her?
- No one.

624
00:51:19,484 --> 00:51:21,008
Joanie! Betty!

625
00:51:21,186 --> 00:51:24,155
You are this close to getting
everything you ever wanted.

626
00:51:24,322 --> 00:51:26,415
And this close to losing it.

627
00:51:38,236 --> 00:51:40,898
I just got a call.
They need me in New York tomorrow.

628
00:51:41,072 --> 00:51:43,870
Joan and Tommy are here.
Can't you leave in the morning?

629
00:51:44,042 --> 00:51:47,944
Then I'd miss the meeting.
Sorry, guys. We take a rain check?

630
00:51:48,113 --> 00:51:50,377
- Sure, buddy.
- We'll see you in the new year.

631
00:51:50,548 --> 00:51:52,448
Happy and merry.

632
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:57,911
I'll call you in the morning.

633
00:52:11,036 --> 00:52:12,594
Coffee?

634
00:52:18,243 --> 00:52:21,144
Guess who has
an early Christmas present?

635
00:52:21,312 --> 00:52:24,941
- Oh, my! How can you live like this?
- Like what?

636
00:52:25,116 --> 00:52:27,482
We'll just wait for you
to tidy up a bit.

637
00:52:27,652 --> 00:52:31,486
In this lifetime? Lt'll never happen.
Come here, beautiful.

638
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:38,027
What are you doing here?

639
00:52:38,396 --> 00:52:42,992
- You still like it here?
- I do. I like getting to know the girls.

640
00:52:43,168 --> 00:52:45,227
Most of the time.

641
00:52:45,403 --> 00:52:47,928
- And the weather.
- Yeah, the weather's nice.

642
00:52:48,106 --> 00:52:49,596
- Are you freezing?
- Yeah.

643
00:52:49,774 --> 00:52:52,470
- Your lips are a little blue.
- I like them that way.

644
00:52:52,644 --> 00:52:54,077
Why didn't you bring a coat?

645
00:53:19,304 --> 00:53:20,703
Bill.

646
00:53:22,407 --> 00:53:24,637
Giselle, what are you doing here?

647
00:53:25,844 --> 00:53:27,505
Freezing.

648
00:53:30,915 --> 00:53:35,045
Look, it's over.
I can't see you anymore.

649
00:53:35,220 --> 00:53:37,518
- I can't.
- I know.

650
00:53:39,023 --> 00:53:40,490
Really.

651
00:53:43,194 --> 00:53:45,628
I just want to talk to you
for a minute.

652
00:53:47,999 --> 00:53:49,591
Come on.

653
00:53:58,510 --> 00:54:00,205
Oh, I missed you.

654
00:54:01,713 --> 00:54:03,340
You're beautiful.

655
00:54:04,182 --> 00:54:06,082
Life without you...

656
00:54:06,251 --> 00:54:08,151
...just isn't life.

657
00:54:09,888 --> 00:54:13,187
And I don't want to go through life
not living. Do you?

658
00:54:13,658 --> 00:54:15,057
No.

659
00:54:15,293 --> 00:54:20,424
I love you so much I would move
to this elitist icebox if you want me to.

660
00:54:26,271 --> 00:54:28,637
Make an honest man out of me.

661
00:54:30,241 --> 00:54:32,106
Miss Watson?

662
00:54:32,477 --> 00:54:35,241
Hi. I didn't know you were here.

663
00:54:39,851 --> 00:54:43,810
Giselle Levy, Bill Dunbar,
this is...

664
00:54:43,988 --> 00:54:46,218
- This is my... Paul.
- Fiancé.

665
00:54:46,658 --> 00:54:49,650
As of about a minute and a half ago.
Paul Moore.

666
00:54:52,030 --> 00:54:56,160
God. Congratulations!
Your fiancé?

667
00:54:58,036 --> 00:54:59,833
You must be thrilled.

668
00:55:00,004 --> 00:55:02,472
I don't think she's caught
her breath yet.

669
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:03,766
I haven't.

670
00:55:06,644 --> 00:55:11,172
- Well, sit down. We'll have a toast.
- We'd love to. We're in a hurry.

671
00:55:11,349 --> 00:55:14,477
But that's really great.
Congratulations, old man.

672
00:55:14,652 --> 00:55:17,917
- Congratulations. Merry Christmas.
- Come on, let's...

673
00:55:18,089 --> 00:55:21,616
Best of tidings to you both. Bye.

674
00:55:50,121 --> 00:55:51,645
No, Paul.

675
00:55:51,823 --> 00:55:54,587
Nancy'll have a heart attack.
She has these rules.

676
00:55:54,759 --> 00:55:57,193
- Come on.
- No.

677
00:55:57,896 --> 00:56:01,593
- Why?
- I said no. I'm not comfortable.

678
00:56:02,867 --> 00:56:05,563
I'll make up the convertible sofa.

679
00:56:12,777 --> 00:56:14,711
What are you doing?

680
00:56:17,181 --> 00:56:19,172
You're not kidding?

681
00:56:19,350 --> 00:56:24,811
I just came 3000 miles to see you.
I'm sleeping down here by myself?

682
00:56:28,660 --> 00:56:31,185
Stop. Stop. Stop for a second.

683
00:56:31,362 --> 00:56:35,059
- Tell me what the hell's going on.
- I don't know.

684
00:56:35,233 --> 00:56:37,633
I feel like everything
is getting away from me.

685
00:56:37,802 --> 00:56:42,899
We haven't actually, literally looked
at each other for three months...

686
00:56:43,074 --> 00:56:46,305
...and now you're here,
and I have this ring on my finger.

687
00:56:46,778 --> 00:56:49,372
Which makes you uncomfortable too?

688
00:56:50,348 --> 00:56:54,842
The last time I checked,
we weren't on this track.

689
00:56:55,186 --> 00:56:57,211
When was the last time
you checked?

690
00:57:18,242 --> 00:57:19,539
Bill...

691
00:57:21,079 --> 00:57:23,047
The name is Paul.

692
00:57:29,487 --> 00:57:32,752
I'm not saying no to you.

693
00:57:32,957 --> 00:57:35,289
No, you're not saying anything.

694
00:57:36,861 --> 00:57:38,886
You never really do.

695
00:57:58,816 --> 00:58:03,412
If you need me for anything else,
my number's on the refrigerator.

696
00:58:03,588 --> 00:58:06,250
I feel so guilty
leaving you alone after...

697
00:58:06,424 --> 00:58:08,949
I'm fine. I have lots of research
to do.

698
00:58:09,127 --> 00:58:12,722
That's right.
Throw yourself into work.

699
00:58:13,031 --> 00:58:14,191
I'll be back...

700
00:58:15,066 --> 00:58:16,897
...on the 2nd.

701
00:58:17,869 --> 00:58:19,734
See you next year.

702
00:58:19,904 --> 00:58:21,701
1954!

703
00:58:57,008 --> 00:58:59,977
Sunflowers. Vincent van Gogh. 1888.

704
00:59:00,144 --> 00:59:03,602
He painted what he felt,
not what he saw.

705
00:59:03,781 --> 00:59:07,182
People didn't understand. To them,
it seemed childlike and crude.

706
00:59:07,351 --> 00:59:10,582
It took years for them to recognize
his actual technique...

707
00:59:10,755 --> 00:59:14,623
...to see the way his brush strokes
seemed to make the night sky move.

708
00:59:14,792 --> 00:59:18,523
Yet, he never sold a painting
in his lifetime.

709
00:59:18,696 --> 00:59:20,687
This is his self-portrait.

710
00:59:20,865 --> 00:59:25,131
There's no camouflage, no romance.
Honesty.

711
00:59:25,303 --> 00:59:30,673
- Now, 60 years later, where is he?
- Famous?

712
00:59:30,842 --> 00:59:34,744
So famous, in fact,
that everybody has a reproduction.

713
00:59:34,912 --> 00:59:37,938
- There are post cards...
- We have the calendar.

714
00:59:38,116 --> 00:59:42,610
With the ability to reproduce art,
it is available to the masses.

715
00:59:42,787 --> 00:59:45,085
No one needs to own
a van Gogh original.

716
00:59:45,256 --> 00:59:48,191
We do. In the Newport house.

717
00:59:48,993 --> 00:59:52,053
But it's small. Tiny.

718
00:59:55,566 --> 00:59:58,831
They can paint their own.
Van Gogh in a box, ladies.

719
00:59:59,003 --> 01:00:02,063
The newest form
of mass-distributed art:

720
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:03,832
Paint by numbers.

721
01:00:04,008 --> 01:00:07,034
"Now everyone can be van Gogh.
It's so easy.

722
01:00:07,211 --> 01:00:09,475
Just follow the simple instructions...

723
01:00:09,647 --> 01:00:12,616
...and in minutes, you're on
your way to being an artist."

724
01:00:13,651 --> 01:00:15,619
Van Gogh by numbers?

725
01:00:15,786 --> 01:00:19,415
Ironic, isn't it? Look at what
we have done to the man...

726
01:00:19,590 --> 01:00:23,219
...who refused to conform
his ideals to popular taste.

727
01:00:23,394 --> 01:00:26,454
Who refused to compromise
his integrity.

728
01:00:26,631 --> 01:00:32,194
We have put him in a tiny box
and asked you to copy him.

729
01:00:32,803 --> 01:00:34,498
So the choice is yours, ladies.

730
01:00:34,672 --> 01:00:39,109
You can conform to what
other people expect or you can...

731
01:00:39,277 --> 01:00:42,246
I know. Be ourselves.

732
01:00:43,214 --> 01:00:45,114
You're a sight for sore eyes.

733
01:00:45,283 --> 01:00:49,583
I would've been on time but, silly me,
I thought class was in the classroom.

734
01:00:49,754 --> 01:00:53,554
Glad you could join us, Mrs. Jones.
We thought we'd lost you.

735
01:00:53,791 --> 01:00:56,385
- There's an unwritten rule for marr...
- Don't bother.

736
01:00:56,561 --> 01:01:00,554
Since your wedding, you've missed
six classes, a paper and your midterm.

737
01:01:00,731 --> 01:01:04,189
Well, thank God I didn't miss
the paint-by-numbers lecture.

738
01:01:04,502 --> 01:01:08,029
I was on my honeymoon
and then I had to set up house.

739
01:01:08,206 --> 01:01:11,232
- What does she expect?
- Attendance.

740
01:01:12,877 --> 01:01:14,868
Most of the faculty turn their heads...

741
01:01:15,046 --> 01:01:17,947
...when the married students
miss a class or two.

742
01:01:18,115 --> 01:01:20,106
Then why not get married
as freshmen?

743
01:01:20,284 --> 01:01:25,381
That way you could graduate without
actually ever stepping foot on campus.

744
01:01:26,657 --> 01:01:30,957
Don't disregard our traditions
just because you're subversive.

745
01:01:32,430 --> 01:01:35,228
Don't disrespect this class
just because you're married.

746
01:01:35,399 --> 01:01:37,833
Don't disrespect me
just because you're not.

747
01:01:38,002 --> 01:01:41,199
Come to class, do the work,
or I'll fail you.

748
01:01:41,372 --> 01:01:44,466
If you fail me,
there will be consequences.

749
01:01:45,776 --> 01:01:49,473
- Are you threatening me?
- I'm educating you.

750
01:01:49,947 --> 01:01:51,778
That's my job.

751
01:02:33,391 --> 01:02:35,552
Miss Watson!

752
01:02:36,193 --> 01:02:38,024
Miss Watson!

753
01:02:40,731 --> 01:02:41,891
What's this?

754
01:02:42,066 --> 01:02:46,093
Every year, the ARs nominate a
member of the faculty to be our guest.

755
01:02:46,270 --> 01:02:47,635
The what?

756
01:02:47,805 --> 01:02:51,366
You'll see. Come by tonight at 5:00.

757
01:02:54,211 --> 01:02:57,908
Adam's Ribs. A very secret society.

758
01:02:58,082 --> 01:02:59,447
Wait here.

759
01:03:08,092 --> 01:03:11,391
First, the oath.
Please raise both hands.

760
01:03:13,064 --> 01:03:16,227
Do you swear not to repeat what
you see, hear or smell tonight?

761
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:17,890
- Smell?
- Keep your hands up!

762
01:03:18,069 --> 01:03:20,162
Yes, smell.

763
01:03:20,438 --> 01:03:21,871
I do.

764
01:03:39,890 --> 01:03:42,222
It'll only burn for a second.

765
01:03:42,393 --> 01:03:43,951
Go on.

766
01:03:54,205 --> 01:03:59,939
And now that you've taken the oath,
we get to ask you whatever we want.

767
01:04:00,111 --> 01:04:04,309
- Oh, is that how it works?
- And you have to answer.

768
01:04:04,882 --> 01:04:06,008
Who invited her?

769
01:04:06,183 --> 01:04:08,378
You're in time
for truth or consequences.

770
01:04:08,552 --> 01:04:11,885
I go first. Why aren't you married?

771
01:04:14,091 --> 01:04:15,615
Well...

772
01:04:17,461 --> 01:04:19,088
That's poisonous.

773
01:04:19,263 --> 01:04:22,994
I'm not married because...

774
01:04:23,434 --> 01:04:24,992
...l'm not.

775
01:04:25,903 --> 01:04:30,363
I was engaged to Patrick Watts.

776
01:04:30,674 --> 01:04:34,269
Everybody called him Leo,
and I never knew why.

777
01:04:34,445 --> 01:04:39,405
He was the first person
that I ever danced with...

778
01:04:39,583 --> 01:04:44,486
...or smoked with,
got incredibly drunk with and...

779
01:04:44,655 --> 01:04:48,022
Well, a lot of first things.

780
01:04:49,460 --> 01:04:53,658
We were 18 and getting married,
Christmas of '41.

781
01:04:54,432 --> 01:04:58,368
Then Pearl Harbor happened
and everything changed.

782
01:04:58,536 --> 01:05:02,700
Everybody changed.
And by June, he was sent overseas.

783
01:05:02,907 --> 01:05:04,738
- Did he come back?
- Yes.

784
01:05:04,909 --> 01:05:07,537
- Was he changed?
- They both were.

785
01:05:10,981 --> 01:05:12,539
I'm sorry.

786
01:05:13,284 --> 01:05:15,946
- Your parents?
- Yeah.

787
01:05:17,888 --> 01:05:19,822
After the war...

788
01:05:20,524 --> 01:05:24,961
...they didn't know each other
anymore, didn't like each other.

789
01:05:26,897 --> 01:05:29,889
He left. He got a whole new family.

790
01:05:31,702 --> 01:05:33,226
Divorce.

791
01:05:33,404 --> 01:05:34,462
What?

792
01:05:34,638 --> 01:05:38,631
Yeah. First on my block.
That's a city block.

793
01:05:41,045 --> 01:05:45,311
People change. Things happen.
It's the same with me and Leo.

794
01:05:45,716 --> 01:05:48,378
He went off and married
someone else.

795
01:05:48,686 --> 01:05:52,178
- And I got to go to graduate school.
- UCLA, right?

796
01:05:52,356 --> 01:05:55,553
- Which is in Hollywood?
- It's close.

797
01:05:55,726 --> 01:06:00,925
Anyway, aren't you gonna tell
everybody about, you know...

798
01:06:01,632 --> 01:06:04,294
...your big news?
- What are you talking about?

799
01:06:04,502 --> 01:06:07,869
- She got engaged over Christmas!
- Congratulations!

800
01:06:08,038 --> 01:06:11,098
I'm sorry to blab.
It's just so romantic.

801
01:06:11,275 --> 01:06:13,038
How fantastic!

802
01:06:13,777 --> 01:06:15,540
We split up.

803
01:06:17,948 --> 01:06:21,247
- What?
- We split up.

804
01:06:23,087 --> 01:06:24,714
Well, that was fast.

805
01:06:24,889 --> 01:06:28,222
Well, not every relationship
is meant for marriage.

806
01:06:28,392 --> 01:06:31,623
- Some are strictly affairs?
- Bill Dunbar.

807
01:06:31,795 --> 01:06:35,026
He'd be an affair. Let's talk
about that, Miss Watson.

808
01:06:35,199 --> 01:06:37,224
You don't believe in withholding,
do you?

809
01:06:37,401 --> 01:06:42,100
No. I do, however, believe in manners.
But for you, I'll make an exception.

810
01:06:42,273 --> 01:06:46,175
That's what we're supposed to do
for married students. Right, Betty?

811
01:06:46,710 --> 01:06:50,942
Professor Dunbar and I
are not having an affair.

812
01:06:51,115 --> 01:06:52,946
Did you have one
with William Holden?

813
01:06:53,117 --> 01:06:55,142
- Connie!
- She asked about Bill Dunbar.

814
01:06:55,319 --> 01:06:58,152
- How did you hear that?
- Oh, it is true!

815
01:06:58,322 --> 01:06:59,619
Betty, I told you.

816
01:07:03,127 --> 01:07:06,358
- Won't you regret never marrying?
- There's still time.

817
01:07:06,530 --> 01:07:08,657
I guess I assume that I will
at some point.

818
01:07:08,832 --> 01:07:11,892
- I'm not gonna plan my life around it.
- Neither should we.

819
01:07:12,069 --> 01:07:13,900
- I didn't say that.
- You did to Joan.

820
01:07:14,071 --> 01:07:16,596
- That's what she told me.
- What are you saying?

821
01:07:16,774 --> 01:07:19,004
She knew you and Tommy
were getting engaged.

822
01:07:19,176 --> 01:07:21,610
And she practically filled out
your application.

823
01:07:21,779 --> 01:07:24,111
- I didn't say that.
- She's been accepted.

824
01:07:24,281 --> 01:07:27,580
Now she just has to figure out
a way to tell Tommy.

825
01:07:28,819 --> 01:07:32,186
Why don't you do it? You're good
at butting into people's business.

826
01:07:32,356 --> 01:07:35,917
Funny, that's what they say
about you.

827
01:07:37,928 --> 01:07:41,989
- Spencer, do I look all right?
- Yeah, fine.

828
01:07:42,166 --> 01:07:45,294
- I don't have a lot of time. Speed it up.
- Mr. Grouchy.

829
01:07:45,769 --> 01:07:49,364
- All right, here we go again.
- All right, go ahead, Louise.

830
01:07:50,341 --> 01:07:54,937
Married Wellesley girls have become
quite adept at balancing obligations.

831
01:07:55,212 --> 01:07:56,839
One hears such comments as:

832
01:07:57,014 --> 01:08:01,576
"I baste the chicken with one hand
and outline the paper with the other."

833
01:08:01,752 --> 01:08:04,949
While our mothers were called
to work for Lady Liberty...

834
01:08:05,122 --> 01:08:10,116
...it is our duty, nay, obligation
to reclaim our place in the home...

835
01:08:10,294 --> 01:08:14,856
...bearing the children that will carry
our traditions into the future.

836
01:08:15,032 --> 01:08:18,900
One must pause to consider why
Miss Katherine Watson...

837
01:08:19,069 --> 01:08:21,367
...instructor in the Art History
department...

838
01:08:21,538 --> 01:08:25,474
...has decided to declare war
on the holy sacrament of marriage.

839
01:08:25,643 --> 01:08:29,272
Her subversive and political teachings
encourage our Wellesley girls...

840
01:08:29,446 --> 01:08:33,007
...to reject the roles
they were born to fill.

841
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:51,831
Thank you.

842
01:09:11,989 --> 01:09:14,184
Slide.

843
01:09:16,427 --> 01:09:18,895
- Contemporary art.
- That's just an advertisement.

844
01:09:19,063 --> 01:09:20,690
Quiet!

845
01:09:22,533 --> 01:09:25,195
Today you just listen.

846
01:09:27,071 --> 01:09:30,939
What will the future scholars see
when they study us?

847
01:09:32,743 --> 01:09:36,440
A portrait of women today?

848
01:09:39,249 --> 01:09:40,716
There you are, ladies.

849
01:09:41,685 --> 01:09:44,210
The perfect likeness
of a Wellesley graduate.

850
01:09:44,388 --> 01:09:50,054
Magna cum laude, doing exactly
what she was trained to do.

851
01:09:50,227 --> 01:09:51,489
Slide.

852
01:09:53,197 --> 01:09:54,459
A Rhodes scholar.

853
01:09:56,800 --> 01:10:00,668
I wonder if she recites Chaucer while
she presses her husband's shirts.

854
01:10:00,838 --> 01:10:02,100
Slide.

855
01:10:04,007 --> 01:10:08,034
Now, you physics majors can calculate
the mass and volume...

856
01:10:08,212 --> 01:10:10,976
...of every meat loaf you make.
Slide.

857
01:10:12,015 --> 01:10:14,449
A girdle to set you free.

858
01:10:14,618 --> 01:10:16,779
What does that mean?

859
01:10:21,925 --> 01:10:24,120
What does that mean?

860
01:10:25,395 --> 01:10:27,522
What does it mean?

861
01:10:31,902 --> 01:10:33,995
I give up.

862
01:10:36,039 --> 01:10:38,030
You win.

863
01:10:38,709 --> 01:10:43,009
The smartest women in the country.

864
01:10:45,649 --> 01:10:50,848
I didn't realize that
by demanding excellence...

865
01:10:51,321 --> 01:10:54,222
...I would be challenging...

866
01:10:56,493 --> 01:10:58,620
What did it say?

867
01:11:00,731 --> 01:11:02,323
What did it say?

868
01:11:04,802 --> 01:11:08,238
"The roles you were born to fill."

869
01:11:09,139 --> 01:11:11,073
Is that right?

870
01:11:14,745 --> 01:11:17,373
The roles you were born to fill?

871
01:11:24,688 --> 01:11:27,122
It's my mistake.

872
01:11:40,103 --> 01:11:42,435
Class dismissed.

873
01:11:54,685 --> 01:11:59,179
These girls...
Are you proud, President Carr?

874
01:11:59,356 --> 01:12:03,383
- Yes, actually, I am.
- Well, you should be, I guess.

875
01:12:03,560 --> 01:12:06,996
Half of them are married.
The other half, give it a month or so.

876
01:12:07,164 --> 01:12:09,291
It's really only a matter of time.

877
01:12:09,466 --> 01:12:11,730
They're biding time
until somebody proposes!

878
01:12:11,902 --> 01:12:14,769
A hundred years ago, it was
inconceivable for a woman...

879
01:12:14,938 --> 01:12:16,428
...to be a college graduate.

880
01:12:16,607 --> 01:12:19,440
Perhaps you should look back
to see how far we've come.

881
01:12:19,610 --> 01:12:22,977
I'm sorry, from where I sit,
it's just a different kind of corset.

882
01:12:23,146 --> 01:12:27,207
- Well, we can all use a little support.
- Oh, like Amanda Armstrong?

883
01:12:27,384 --> 01:12:29,716
- She broke the law!
- According to Betty Warren.

884
01:12:29,887 --> 01:12:32,321
According to the state
of Massachusetts.

885
01:12:36,293 --> 01:12:38,488
To hell with Wellesley.
I'm done.

886
01:12:40,130 --> 01:12:42,530
Goddamn it!

887
01:12:44,801 --> 01:12:47,269
It's brilliant, really.
A perfect ruse.

888
01:12:47,437 --> 01:12:50,304
A finishing school disguised
as a college. They got me.

889
01:12:50,474 --> 01:12:52,408
- What do you expect?
- More. More.

890
01:12:52,576 --> 01:12:56,239
I thought it was a place for
tomorrow's leaders, not their wives.

891
01:12:56,413 --> 01:12:58,244
- Calm down, please.
- No, I will not!

892
01:12:58,415 --> 01:13:01,680
I've got 10 more minutes.
Meet me in my office. Meet me!

893
01:13:26,944 --> 01:13:32,280
- How you feeling?
- Stupid. Deceived.

894
01:13:32,516 --> 01:13:35,485
Really, really angry.

895
01:13:36,920 --> 01:13:42,415
Change takes time, you know?
You gotta let them catch up with you.

896
01:13:43,393 --> 01:13:46,021
Katherine, this place needs you.

897
01:13:46,596 --> 01:13:51,124
I don't know how the hell they let
you in, but I'm sure glad they did.

898
01:13:54,204 --> 01:13:59,039
The things I said to President Carr.
She'll never let me back in.

899
01:13:59,209 --> 01:14:00,972
She's a pretty good egg.

900
01:14:02,279 --> 01:14:04,474
What things?

901
01:14:04,648 --> 01:14:06,707
Don't worry.

902
01:14:07,150 --> 01:14:08,981
Time will heal it.

903
01:14:09,152 --> 01:14:13,145
Unless, of course, you want to go back
to California and that fiancé of yours.

904
01:14:14,591 --> 01:14:17,685
We're not engaged. Thanks.

905
01:14:17,861 --> 01:14:21,058
Sorry I interrupted your class.

906
01:14:31,274 --> 01:14:32,901
Katherine!

907
01:14:37,180 --> 01:14:41,640
I wanted to give you this.
It was for Christmas, and...

908
01:14:41,885 --> 01:14:44,752
Then I met your man, so I...

909
01:15:01,104 --> 01:15:03,595
The Sistine Chapel.

910
01:15:04,274 --> 01:15:06,071
David.

911
01:15:06,643 --> 01:15:09,737
Venus de Milo. And...

912
01:15:10,547 --> 01:15:12,242
...Mona Lisa.

913
01:15:14,985 --> 01:15:16,976
Thank you.

914
01:15:24,895 --> 01:15:28,126
This is gonna be
a three-in-one shot. Ready?

915
01:15:30,100 --> 01:15:33,092
You didn't even try.

916
01:15:34,671 --> 01:15:37,970
This game is probably a no-no
in the Better Homes and Gardens.

917
01:15:38,141 --> 01:15:42,305
Not that I have ever been in the
better homes and gardens. Have you?

918
01:15:42,479 --> 01:15:44,640
No. No, I'm just an old soldier.

919
01:15:44,815 --> 01:15:48,581
They don't invite us.

920
01:15:48,752 --> 01:15:50,845
What do they say about them though?

921
01:15:51,021 --> 01:15:53,751
- Old soldiers never die. We just...
- They just...

922
01:15:53,924 --> 01:15:57,382
...become philandering
Italian professors.

923
01:15:57,561 --> 01:15:59,688
- That was below the belt.
- That was unkind.

924
01:15:59,863 --> 01:16:01,296
Deeply unkind.

925
01:16:15,946 --> 01:16:19,404
You know, I don't know how I feel
about being a rebound.

926
01:16:19,583 --> 01:16:23,781
- I'll leave.
- No, you don't have to do that.

927
01:16:23,954 --> 01:16:26,218
I'll get used to it.

928
01:16:26,456 --> 01:16:29,721
- What are you doing?
- Getting dressed.

929
01:16:29,893 --> 01:16:33,852
I had fun, and I'm not looking
for anything serious.

930
01:16:34,030 --> 01:16:36,726
Why don't you come down here
and we can discuss it.

931
01:16:36,900 --> 01:16:41,166
But as long as we're doing
whatever it is that we're doing...

932
01:16:41,338 --> 01:16:44,171
Which we did pretty well,
don't you think?

933
01:16:47,444 --> 01:16:49,036
No students.

934
01:16:50,847 --> 01:16:53,247
I'm serious.

935
01:16:53,817 --> 01:16:59,016
I don't want to teach a class wondering
why a girl is wearing my perfume.

936
01:17:00,857 --> 01:17:03,951
- Katherine, l...
- I need your word.

937
01:17:07,631 --> 01:17:09,098
All right, you have my word.

938
01:17:11,868 --> 01:17:14,166
- Okay.
- Now can we change the subject?

939
01:17:14,337 --> 01:17:18,034
Talk about something
a little more interesting?

940
01:17:18,208 --> 01:17:21,336
Like breakfast.

941
01:17:21,778 --> 01:17:24,110
You know, I make
a mean blueberry pancake.

942
01:17:24,281 --> 01:17:26,215
I just put that shoe on.

943
01:17:26,383 --> 01:17:29,011
I don't think I know you
well enough for breakfast.

944
01:17:29,186 --> 01:17:30,881
I don't know about that.

945
01:17:34,591 --> 01:17:36,650
So how does a guy
get to know you better?

946
01:17:36,826 --> 01:17:40,819
Well, let me...
That's a good idea.

947
01:17:48,605 --> 01:17:51,073
Is that a battle wound you have?

948
01:17:54,911 --> 01:17:59,041
I'm a sucker for war stories
in Romance languages.

949
01:17:59,216 --> 01:18:01,548
- Well, that's pretty easy.
- Yeah?

950
01:18:03,353 --> 01:18:09,314
I was in a village... called San Remo...

951
01:18:11,428 --> 01:18:15,330
...the Krauts pounded us hard...

952
01:18:15,498 --> 01:18:17,056
...me & Stan...

953
01:18:17,300 --> 01:18:22,033
...you remember Stan? We were the
only two left from our platoon.

954
01:18:22,305 --> 01:18:29,643
We heard a distant cry coming
from an abandoned shed.

955
01:18:30,447 --> 01:18:32,039
When night fell...

956
01:18:32,682 --> 01:18:34,047
A trap it was?

957
01:18:37,354 --> 01:18:38,844
Remember...

958
01:18:39,656 --> 01:18:42,216
...invert your nouns and
your verbs.

959
01:19:06,883 --> 01:19:08,510
- Hungry?
- Famished.

960
01:19:08,685 --> 01:19:11,779
Don't say we can live on love.
That's how I missed breakfast.

961
01:19:16,026 --> 01:19:17,857
What's the matter?

962
01:19:19,195 --> 01:19:22,631
- What's the matter?
- Phillip and Vanessa Mclntyre.

963
01:19:22,799 --> 01:19:25,393
- Parents of a friend.
- You wanna say a quick hello?

964
01:19:25,568 --> 01:19:28,560
No! No, I'll be trapped.

965
01:19:28,738 --> 01:19:30,501
Damn it!

966
01:19:33,643 --> 01:19:36,305
- Could you seat us in the bar?
- We're only serving...

967
01:19:36,479 --> 01:19:39,539
...in the front part of the restaurant
this afternoon.

968
01:19:43,386 --> 01:19:46,048
Miss! Miss Stone.

969
01:19:46,222 --> 01:19:50,886
This has been the most romantic
weekend I may ever have.

970
01:19:51,061 --> 01:19:55,191
Ever. And all that's standing
between right now and perfection...

971
01:19:55,432 --> 01:19:57,696
...are the Mclntyres over there.

972
01:19:57,867 --> 01:20:03,100
Now, with the competition out there,
a girl's got to be able to move...

973
01:20:03,273 --> 01:20:06,037
...a few mountains
every once in a while.

974
01:20:06,209 --> 01:20:09,975
- I could use all the help I could get.
- Come this way.

975
01:20:14,684 --> 01:20:18,848
- I fixed it. No more Mclntyres.
- Thank you. Thank you.

976
01:20:21,157 --> 01:20:24,718
- Let's not talk about this.
- All right.

977
01:20:27,430 --> 01:20:29,557
Hold your breath and...

978
01:20:31,868 --> 01:20:33,893
And turn.

979
01:20:34,437 --> 01:20:37,770
Don't forget to smile.

980
01:20:38,842 --> 01:20:40,639
Arms up.

981
01:20:40,810 --> 01:20:43,472
Move together. Faster, Fran!

982
01:20:44,647 --> 01:20:48,083
- When you surface, smile.
- Come on, Connie!

983
01:20:50,720 --> 01:20:54,212
How about we have a girls' luncheon
this weekend? Just us.

984
01:20:55,058 --> 01:20:57,492
- Where's Spencer?
- Away.

985
01:20:57,660 --> 01:20:59,855
- I'm free.
- I'm busy.

986
01:21:00,029 --> 01:21:02,554
- What are you doing?
- She's dating a psychoanalyst.

987
01:21:02,732 --> 01:21:04,495
- Oh, really?
- Who's married.

988
01:21:04,667 --> 01:21:07,261
- Giselle!
- Sorry, it slipped.

989
01:21:07,437 --> 01:21:09,803
- Are you in, Connie?
- I'll check with Charlie.

990
01:21:09,973 --> 01:21:12,908
- Who?
- Charlie Stewart. Your cousin.

991
01:21:13,076 --> 01:21:15,135
You're kidding?

992
01:21:17,480 --> 01:21:20,210
We spent last weekend at the Cape.

993
01:21:20,383 --> 01:21:24,012
- A little hideaway he knew about.
- Operative word, "hide."

994
01:21:24,187 --> 01:21:27,520
Men take women to the Cape in
the winter when they're embarrassed.

995
01:21:27,690 --> 01:21:30,853
- He's using you.
- He's not using you if you want to go.

996
01:21:31,027 --> 01:21:32,756
Come here. Don't listen to her.

997
01:21:33,496 --> 01:21:36,397
I love you, and I swear
I'm not saying this to hurt you.

998
01:21:36,566 --> 01:21:40,593
Charlie's promised to Deb Mclntyre.
She wears his pin.

999
01:21:41,404 --> 01:21:45,135
- Giselle, you know it's true.
- I don't know anything about a pin.

1000
01:21:45,308 --> 01:21:47,299
Mclntyre?

1001
01:21:47,744 --> 01:21:50,611
Are her parents named
Phillip and Vanessa?

1002
01:21:51,214 --> 01:21:53,079
You know them?

1003
01:21:54,751 --> 01:21:56,514
Only from a distance.

1004
01:22:09,365 --> 01:22:13,165
- Good morning. Good morning.
- Goodbye. Good morning.

1005
01:22:13,336 --> 01:22:15,827
Okay, wait. No, we have an audience.
Don't look.

1006
01:22:18,441 --> 01:22:20,602
No, I don't...
No. Stop it. Put me down.

1007
01:22:20,777 --> 01:22:23,075
Put me down.
You're not coming in this house.

1008
01:22:23,246 --> 01:22:26,613
You are not coming
in this house. No.

1009
01:22:26,783 --> 01:22:28,546
- Bye. Good morning.
- Good morning.

1010
01:22:28,718 --> 01:22:30,686
Go away. Go away.

1011
01:22:37,760 --> 01:22:42,697
How can you date a man like that?

1012
01:22:43,833 --> 01:22:46,700
What if you're wrong about him?

1013
01:22:46,870 --> 01:22:49,031
What if I'm not?

1014
01:22:54,210 --> 01:22:56,678
Coffee's cold.

1015
01:23:17,867 --> 01:23:19,357
Row!

1016
01:23:19,536 --> 01:23:20,935
Ride the plank!

1017
01:23:21,104 --> 01:23:23,299
Row!

1018
01:23:45,328 --> 01:23:47,728
Are your ears burning?

1019
01:23:48,431 --> 01:23:51,491
I think the feet go first
when they set the stake on fire.

1020
01:23:51,668 --> 01:23:54,432
"What do you say, Edward?
Should we have her back?"

1021
01:23:54,604 --> 01:23:56,868
"She's got rather nice legs."

1022
01:23:57,040 --> 01:23:59,099
- Who's to say I wanna come back?
- What...

1023
01:23:59,275 --> 01:24:02,073
...leave me here with all these girls?

1024
01:24:12,121 --> 01:24:14,419
You'd think someone
would notice empty trays.

1025
01:24:14,591 --> 01:24:17,958
You are good. You remind me
of myself when I was your age.

1026
01:24:32,909 --> 01:24:34,809
Cheers.

1027
01:24:35,044 --> 01:24:38,912
He's positively vomititious, Giselle.

1028
01:24:39,215 --> 01:24:41,843
Don't be so sentimental, Connie.

1029
01:24:43,019 --> 01:24:46,318
It was a fling. It's fine.
It was nothing.

1030
01:24:55,298 --> 01:24:57,266
Hi!

1031
01:24:58,434 --> 01:25:00,368
Pleasure to meet you.

1032
01:25:06,109 --> 01:25:08,600
Would you excuse me?
I'll be right back.

1033
01:25:09,512 --> 01:25:12,743
Connie! Connie!
Excuse me. Sorry. Connie!

1034
01:25:12,915 --> 01:25:15,816
Charlie. It's been a while.

1035
01:25:15,985 --> 01:25:18,852
Yeah. How are you?

1036
01:25:19,088 --> 01:25:21,750
I'm fine, thank you. You? Deb?

1037
01:25:22,625 --> 01:25:26,254
- Pardon?
- Deb. Your girlfriend.

1038
01:25:26,429 --> 01:25:28,260
With the very large...

1039
01:25:28,431 --> 01:25:30,194
With the very large teeth.

1040
01:25:30,366 --> 01:25:32,664
With the very large teeth.

1041
01:25:32,835 --> 01:25:36,794
- Oh, did you think I didn't know?
- Connie.

1042
01:25:36,973 --> 01:25:40,932
Deb and I broke it off last summer.
That's Miranda.

1043
01:25:41,110 --> 01:25:46,742
We started seeing each other when
you stopped returning my calls...

1044
01:25:46,916 --> 01:25:49,885
...or answering any of my letters.

1045
01:25:55,591 --> 01:25:57,081
Okay, maybe I should go.

1046
01:26:16,546 --> 01:26:19,037
Have you seen Spencer?

1047
01:26:25,788 --> 01:26:28,621
But I did see Charlie Stewart.

1048
01:26:30,193 --> 01:26:33,959
And he told me that he and Deb
broke up last summer.

1049
01:26:34,664 --> 01:26:38,964
And you told me they were together
when he invited me to the Cape.

1050
01:26:39,135 --> 01:26:42,161
Oh, Connie.
I don't keep track of his dates.

1051
01:26:42,338 --> 01:26:46,866
They've been on-again, off-again
for the past few years.

1052
01:26:47,043 --> 01:26:51,173
No, apparently they've been
off-again for a while. For quite a while.

1053
01:26:51,347 --> 01:26:54,316
- So?
- So you made me believe...

1054
01:26:54,484 --> 01:26:57,112
...that he was hiding me.

1055
01:26:59,288 --> 01:27:01,620
Either way...

1056
01:27:01,791 --> 01:27:04,624
...why couldn't you let me be happy?

1057
01:27:10,900 --> 01:27:12,800
Betty.

1058
01:27:36,292 --> 01:27:38,590
And we switch.

1059
01:27:40,496 --> 01:27:43,294
- Wonder teacher.
- Tommy.

1060
01:27:45,635 --> 01:27:49,162
- How's Harvard?
- Oh, not too bad. Not too bad.

1061
01:27:49,338 --> 01:27:51,829
- Congratulate me.
- You set a date?

1062
01:27:54,377 --> 01:27:56,402
No, nothing official. Yet.

1063
01:27:56,579 --> 01:27:59,571
I meant, I got into Penn. Grad school.

1064
01:28:00,049 --> 01:28:03,018
Congratulations. What about Yale?

1065
01:28:03,619 --> 01:28:08,886
Yale? Oh, you mean Joanie.
Yeah. How about that, huh?

1066
01:28:09,125 --> 01:28:11,685
She is some girl.

1067
01:28:11,861 --> 01:28:14,421
- She's terrific.
- Yeah.

1068
01:28:14,597 --> 01:28:19,830
Just the fact that she got in.
I mean, she will always have that.

1069
01:28:20,002 --> 01:28:23,938
Thanks to you. Miss Watson,
you've been real swell to her.

1070
01:28:24,106 --> 01:28:26,700
We both appreciate it.

1071
01:28:28,110 --> 01:28:31,409
I'm sorry. "The fact that she got in,"
what does that mean?

1072
01:28:31,581 --> 01:28:34,880
Well, she'll be in Philadelphia.

1073
01:28:35,051 --> 01:28:36,518
With me.

1074
01:28:39,789 --> 01:28:43,885
Well, that's an awful long commute
to get dinner on the table by 5:00.

1075
01:28:44,493 --> 01:28:48,259
- And we switch.
- Thank you.

1076
01:28:54,303 --> 01:28:56,134
Excuse me.

1077
01:28:56,405 --> 01:28:59,772
Excuse me. Have you seen Spencer?
I can't find him anywhere.

1078
01:29:03,512 --> 01:29:07,312
Actually, Spencer asked me
to take you home.

1079
01:29:07,483 --> 01:29:11,613
- He has this meeting...
- In New York.

1080
01:29:12,021 --> 01:29:13,886
Thank you.

1081
01:29:42,551 --> 01:29:45,987
- Honey, what are you doing here?
- I'm staying the night.

1082
01:29:46,155 --> 01:29:49,955
- Spencer won't mind?
- Spencer won't notice.

1083
01:29:50,126 --> 01:29:55,758
- He's in New York again. Working.
- He's working hard for both of you.

1084
01:29:55,932 --> 01:29:59,766
Don't lie for him, Mother.
He does it so well for himself.

1085
01:29:59,936 --> 01:30:02,427
You're going to turn around,
go home...

1086
01:30:02,605 --> 01:30:04,903
...fix your face
and wait for your husband.

1087
01:30:05,074 --> 01:30:08,271
This is the bargain you made,
Elizabeth. We all did.

1088
01:30:08,444 --> 01:30:10,878
So you're not gonna let me
stay in my own house?

1089
01:30:11,047 --> 01:30:13,208
Spencer's house is your house now.

1090
01:30:13,382 --> 01:30:17,341
Believe me, it's for your own good.

1091
01:30:34,403 --> 01:30:37,201
Miss Watson. Come in.

1092
01:30:37,640 --> 01:30:40,404
Seven law schools within 45 minutes
of Philadelphia.

1093
01:30:40,576 --> 01:30:43,306
You can study and get dinner
on the table by 5:00.

1094
01:30:43,479 --> 01:30:46,312
- It's too late.
- No. Some accept late admissions.

1095
01:30:46,482 --> 01:30:48,643
- I was upset at first.
- Joan, the guests.

1096
01:30:48,818 --> 01:30:51,787
When Tommy told me that he got
accepted to Penn, I thought:

1097
01:30:51,954 --> 01:30:54,752
"Her fate is sealed.
How can she throw it all away?"

1098
01:30:54,924 --> 01:30:58,724
I realized you won't have to. You
could bake your cake and eat it too.

1099
01:30:58,894 --> 01:31:01,124
We're married.

1100
01:31:02,431 --> 01:31:04,262
We eloped over the weekend.

1101
01:31:04,433 --> 01:31:07,197
Turned out he was petrified
of a big ceremony...

1102
01:31:07,370 --> 01:31:10,464
...so we did a sort of
spur-of-the-moment thing.

1103
01:31:10,639 --> 01:31:12,573
Very romantic.

1104
01:31:12,742 --> 01:31:14,505
Look.

1105
01:31:22,918 --> 01:31:25,045
It's beautiful.

1106
01:31:28,057 --> 01:31:32,858
It was my choice. Not to go.
He would have supported it.

1107
01:31:33,462 --> 01:31:37,057
- But you don't have to choose.
- No, I have to.

1108
01:31:37,233 --> 01:31:40,202
I want a home, a family.
It's not something I'll sacrifice.

1109
01:31:40,369 --> 01:31:43,532
No one's asking you
to sacrifice that, Joan.

1110
01:31:43,706 --> 01:31:46,436
I just want you to understand
that you can do both.

1111
01:31:46,609 --> 01:31:49,476
Think I'll wake up one day
and regret not being a lawyer?

1112
01:31:49,645 --> 01:31:51,203
Yes, I'm afraid that you will.

1113
01:31:51,380 --> 01:31:55,817
Not as much as I'd regret not having
a family. Not being there to raise them.

1114
01:31:55,985 --> 01:32:00,388
I know exactly what I'm doing, and
it doesn't make me any less smart.

1115
01:32:01,257 --> 01:32:04,283
- This must seem terrible to you.
- I didn't say that. I...

1116
01:32:04,460 --> 01:32:07,486
Sure you did. You always do.

1117
01:32:07,663 --> 01:32:11,360
You stand in class and tell us to look
beyond the image, but you don't.

1118
01:32:11,534 --> 01:32:15,436
To you, a housewife is someone who
sold her soul for a center hall colonial.

1119
01:32:15,604 --> 01:32:19,404
She has no depth,
no intellect, no interests.

1120
01:32:22,178 --> 01:32:25,978
You're the one who said
I could do anything I wanted.

1121
01:32:26,148 --> 01:32:28,514
This is what I want.

1122
01:32:33,089 --> 01:32:35,250
Congratulations.

1123
01:32:35,424 --> 01:32:37,449
Be happy.

1124
01:32:58,514 --> 01:33:02,610
Sometimes I think you say
these things to provoke me.

1125
01:33:02,785 --> 01:33:05,754
Does your father know
that you speak this way?

1126
01:33:10,259 --> 01:33:13,057
Does your wife know you're here?

1127
01:33:50,766 --> 01:33:54,429
- Where might I find Charlie Stewart?
- Charlie Stewart? C1744.

1128
01:33:54,603 --> 01:33:57,868
- But it's too late. You'll have to leave.
- All right.

1129
01:34:02,511 --> 01:34:04,672
You can't go up there!

1130
01:34:07,917 --> 01:34:09,782
What is going on here?

1131
01:34:09,952 --> 01:34:12,284
There's no women allowed
in the dorms!

1132
01:34:14,156 --> 01:34:17,284
Can you please not interrupt me?!

1133
01:34:18,861 --> 01:34:23,992
Connie! What are you doing here?

1134
01:34:25,901 --> 01:34:27,266
Well, I saw...

1135
01:34:27,436 --> 01:34:29,529
I saw Big Teeth with...

1136
01:34:29,705 --> 01:34:33,300
...Kevin Tawil looking pretty cozy,
and I thought that maybe...

1137
01:34:33,475 --> 01:34:36,069
Maybe you two weren't...

1138
01:34:36,979 --> 01:34:40,710
- Dating?
- Yes. Thank you.

1139
01:34:40,983 --> 01:34:43,144
Hey, no girls in the dorm.

1140
01:34:47,156 --> 01:34:50,387
I know I have made mistakes.
A ton.

1141
01:34:50,960 --> 01:34:53,793
But I never make them twice.

1142
01:35:13,115 --> 01:35:14,639
And?

1143
01:35:15,217 --> 01:35:20,814
And it was perfect. Romantic.
We stayed up all night talking.

1144
01:35:20,990 --> 01:35:23,322
You're late. What happened
to Sunday brunch?

1145
01:35:23,492 --> 01:35:26,689
We stayed up all night too.
Not talking.

1146
01:35:27,329 --> 01:35:30,662
The psychoanalyst? Again.

1147
01:35:32,568 --> 01:35:35,628
- Divine exhaustion.
- He's married.

1148
01:35:35,804 --> 01:35:37,601
He's not married like
you and Tommy.

1149
01:35:37,773 --> 01:35:39,206
What does that mean?

1150
01:35:39,375 --> 01:35:42,503
It means he and his wife
don't speak the same language.

1151
01:35:42,678 --> 01:35:45,442
- Spelled S-E-X.
- Does he pay you?

1152
01:35:45,614 --> 01:35:47,138
For sex?

1153
01:35:47,483 --> 01:35:50,008
At the rate you're going,
you could make a fortune.

1154
01:35:50,552 --> 01:35:53,953
- Betty.
- Everyone thinks so.

1155
01:35:54,123 --> 01:35:57,820
Do you know what they say?
They say you're a whore.

1156
01:35:58,327 --> 01:36:02,354
Once they've all sampled you,
they'll toss you aside like a used rag.

1157
01:36:02,531 --> 01:36:05,364
- Betty, stop now.
- The men you love don't want you.

1158
01:36:05,534 --> 01:36:08,901
- Your father doesn't want you.
- I'm gonna meet you downstairs.

1159
01:36:09,071 --> 01:36:11,096
- Professor Dunbar.
- Betty, that's enough.

1160
01:36:11,273 --> 01:36:14,003
Everybody knows that you hide
outside his house.

1161
01:36:14,209 --> 01:36:17,872
It must be torturous running after
a man who doesn't care about you...

1162
01:36:18,314 --> 01:36:21,613
...who's in love with someone else,
who hates you.

1163
01:36:21,784 --> 01:36:24,116
- He hates you!
- Betty.

1164
01:36:24,286 --> 01:36:26,220
And it hurts! No!

1165
01:36:26,388 --> 01:36:29,380
- Get off me!
- Quiet!

1166
01:36:38,467 --> 01:36:40,458
Oh, God.

1167
01:36:42,271 --> 01:36:45,570
- He doesn't want me.
- Okay.

1168
01:36:45,774 --> 01:36:48,868
He doesn't sleep with me. He...

1169
01:36:49,178 --> 01:36:50,702
I know.

1170
01:37:03,125 --> 01:37:07,323
I say no. I mean, it's not fair to her.

1171
01:37:07,496 --> 01:37:11,125
- She's not happy.
- Don't forget about her outburst.

1172
01:37:11,300 --> 01:37:13,427
Oh, that's right.

1173
01:37:13,702 --> 01:37:17,297
Dr. Staunton, will you tell the
alumnae the figures you have?

1174
01:37:17,473 --> 01:37:20,442
Enrollment for her class next year...

1175
01:37:20,609 --> 01:37:25,103
...is the highest
the department's had. Ever.

1176
01:37:26,115 --> 01:37:28,777
She'd have to promise
to turn in her lesson plans.

1177
01:37:29,184 --> 01:37:33,086
In advance. And they'll need
to be approved.

1178
01:37:33,255 --> 01:37:35,246
She'll never agree to that.

1179
01:37:44,466 --> 01:37:47,594
Bill, the brochures
for Europe arrived.

1180
01:37:52,107 --> 01:37:54,007
Surprise!

1181
01:37:54,343 --> 01:37:57,039
Sir, I'm so sorry!

1182
01:37:57,212 --> 01:37:59,703
- Who are you?
- I'm Stanley Sher...

1183
01:37:59,882 --> 01:38:02,476
...a friend of Bill's.
We were in the 37th together.

1184
01:38:02,651 --> 01:38:05,415
- Okay.
- You must be Katherine.

1185
01:38:05,587 --> 01:38:07,578
I am.

1186
01:38:07,756 --> 01:38:11,283
He told me you were a looker, but...

1187
01:38:13,262 --> 01:38:17,198
- I'll wait for you downstairs, Stanley.
- Okey-dokey.

1188
01:38:21,136 --> 01:38:23,400
So you and Bill
were in the war together?

1189
01:38:23,572 --> 01:38:27,099
Yep. Now he's some
fancy teacher...

1190
01:38:27,276 --> 01:38:29,642
...and I'm in air conditioning.

1191
01:38:29,812 --> 01:38:31,302
Forget the A-bomb.

1192
01:38:32,247 --> 01:38:35,148
Freon. It's gonna change
the good old U.S. Of A.

1193
01:38:35,517 --> 01:38:39,510
Open the entire West to development.
I'm based in El Paso.

1194
01:38:39,955 --> 01:38:42,822
- Oh, thank you.
- And cheers.

1195
01:38:45,694 --> 01:38:48,162
Well, you've come a long way
from San Remo.

1196
01:38:48,330 --> 01:38:50,264
Yes, sirree.

1197
01:38:50,866 --> 01:38:53,027
That in California?

1198
01:38:53,735 --> 01:38:55,259
Italy.

1199
01:38:55,437 --> 01:38:58,838
- Where you two were stationed.
- Italy?

1200
01:38:59,007 --> 01:39:01,475
Well, somebody's been
pulling your long leg.

1201
01:39:01,643 --> 01:39:05,875
We were stationed at the Army
Language Institute on Long Island.

1202
01:39:06,048 --> 01:39:09,984
Closest we ever got to Italy
was the baked ziti at Mama Leone's.

1203
01:39:10,152 --> 01:39:13,087
I don't think Bill's
ever been to Europe.

1204
01:39:13,255 --> 01:39:15,416
I sure as hell haven't.

1205
01:39:15,824 --> 01:39:17,086
Cheers.

1206
01:39:27,269 --> 01:39:29,203
Katherine!

1207
01:39:33,208 --> 01:39:34,937
You okay?

1208
01:39:35,911 --> 01:39:37,970
I met Stan.

1209
01:39:38,914 --> 01:39:40,176
Hell of a nice guy.

1210
01:39:40,349 --> 01:39:42,112
- Yeah.
- What a talker.

1211
01:39:42,284 --> 01:39:44,218
Yeah.

1212
01:39:44,386 --> 01:39:47,446
We go back a long way.

1213
01:39:47,623 --> 01:39:50,148
All the way to Long Island.

1214
01:39:54,096 --> 01:39:56,326
Secret's out.

1215
01:39:57,833 --> 01:40:00,563
What an incredible lie.

1216
01:40:03,639 --> 01:40:07,234
I spoke the language, I had the
uniform, people just assumed things.

1217
01:40:07,409 --> 01:40:11,903
I didn't correct them.
I guess I should've done.

1218
01:40:13,148 --> 01:40:15,548
I guess you should've done.

1219
01:40:17,286 --> 01:40:20,187
Katherine, look, I'm sorry, okay?

1220
01:40:20,822 --> 01:40:22,847
I made a mistake.

1221
01:40:23,025 --> 01:40:24,925
Just give me a chance...

1222
01:40:25,093 --> 01:40:27,618
...to straighten things out, okay?

1223
01:40:30,899 --> 01:40:33,697
Why couldn't you just be honest?

1224
01:40:36,471 --> 01:40:38,564
You don't make it easy.

1225
01:40:40,742 --> 01:40:42,607
You're so perfect, you...

1226
01:40:44,713 --> 01:40:47,739
It's impossible to be honest
with you. I...

1227
01:40:48,850 --> 01:40:50,943
For you, it is.

1228
01:40:54,122 --> 01:40:58,183
Well, it's not just me, Katherine.
Joan failed you too, right?

1229
01:40:58,360 --> 01:41:01,761
- That's an awful thing to say.
- I know, but it's the truth.

1230
01:41:03,065 --> 01:41:05,863
If you want honesty,
I can be real honest.

1231
01:41:06,068 --> 01:41:09,060
You didn't come to Wellesley
to help people find their way.

1232
01:41:09,237 --> 01:41:12,764
I think you came to help people
find your way.

1233
01:41:37,399 --> 01:41:40,835
I'm not accustomed
to hunting you down.

1234
01:41:42,804 --> 01:41:45,364
Elizabeth, look at me, please.

1235
01:41:49,978 --> 01:41:52,970
I've spoken with Mrs. Jones.
There will be no divorce.

1236
01:41:54,249 --> 01:41:57,446
There's always a period
of adjustment.

1237
01:41:57,619 --> 01:42:01,453
I've assured her that you will try
for a year.

1238
01:42:04,026 --> 01:42:06,324
Look at this, Mother.

1239
01:42:11,166 --> 01:42:13,361
Spencer will try as well.

1240
01:42:13,535 --> 01:42:17,733
According to her, he's really
very upset. You should call him.

1241
01:42:17,906 --> 01:42:21,865
She's smiling. Is she happy?

1242
01:42:23,278 --> 01:42:27,112
The important thing
is not to tell anyone.

1243
01:42:27,282 --> 01:42:29,011
She looks happy.

1244
01:42:29,551 --> 01:42:31,883
So, what does it matter?

1245
01:42:32,554 --> 01:42:36,888
Don't wash your dirty laundry
in public.

1246
01:42:37,192 --> 01:42:39,820
Let me tell you something.

1247
01:42:41,096 --> 01:42:44,554
Not everything is as it seems.

1248
01:43:03,785 --> 01:43:06,310
Dear Miss Watson:

1249
01:43:06,488 --> 01:43:08,649
It is with great pleasure...

1250
01:43:08,824 --> 01:43:11,019
...that we invite you...

1251
01:43:11,193 --> 01:43:14,651
...to return as an instructor...

1252
01:43:14,830 --> 01:43:17,162
...in the Art History department...

1253
01:43:17,332 --> 01:43:22,964
...for the 1954-1955
academic year.

1254
01:43:23,138 --> 01:43:28,007
We do wish to make clear, however,
that this invitation...

1255
01:43:28,176 --> 01:43:33,637
...is absolutely conditional
upon the following:

1256
01:43:35,183 --> 01:43:37,378
Please, Nora, may we continue?

1257
01:43:37,552 --> 01:43:39,645
Number one:

1258
01:43:40,155 --> 01:43:45,388
You will teach only the syllabus
as outlined by the department chair.

1259
01:43:46,328 --> 01:43:48,023
Number two:

1260
01:43:48,196 --> 01:43:50,096
All lesson plans...

1261
01:43:50,265 --> 01:43:55,532
...must be submitted at the beginning
of every term for approval...

1262
01:43:55,704 --> 01:43:57,831
...and revision.

1263
01:43:58,006 --> 01:43:59,371
Number three:

1264
01:43:59,541 --> 01:44:03,637
You shall not provide counsel
beyond your own subject...

1265
01:44:03,812 --> 01:44:06,838
...for any student at any time.

1266
01:44:07,015 --> 01:44:08,642
And finally:

1267
01:44:08,817 --> 01:44:14,153
That you will agree to maintain
a strictly professional relationship...

1268
01:44:14,322 --> 01:44:16,916
...with all members of the faculty.

1269
01:44:17,092 --> 01:44:19,560
- Good evening, Katherine.
- Hi, Violet.

1270
01:44:19,961 --> 01:44:24,125
Assuming you accept the conditions,
we look forward to your continuing...

1271
01:44:24,299 --> 01:44:26,529
...to be a part
of our Wellesley tradition.

1272
01:44:35,310 --> 01:44:37,710
Nice party.

1273
01:44:37,879 --> 01:44:39,574
I didn't realize.

1274
01:44:40,682 --> 01:44:42,513
It was a surprise.

1275
01:44:42,717 --> 01:44:45,481
William H. Taft.
What does the letter H stand for?

1276
01:44:45,654 --> 01:44:48,122
- Howard.
- Howard. Yes!

1277
01:44:48,890 --> 01:44:50,721
Howard.

1278
01:44:51,660 --> 01:44:53,651
Oh, it doesn't matter.

1279
01:44:53,829 --> 01:44:57,697
The important thing is
that you'll be back next year.

1280
01:44:57,866 --> 01:45:00,300
Hopefully living here.

1281
01:45:03,338 --> 01:45:07,707
Well, I haven't really thought about
that. They just told me today.

1282
01:45:09,611 --> 01:45:11,909
Well, there's still plenty of time.

1283
01:45:12,280 --> 01:45:15,306
You should be celebrating.

1284
01:45:21,223 --> 01:45:22,952
You're right.

1285
01:45:25,060 --> 01:45:27,085
You're right. Let's celebrate.

1286
01:45:30,398 --> 01:45:34,198
Let's go upstairs and get gussied up
and go out dancing.

1287
01:45:36,538 --> 01:45:41,202
Silly, it's after 8:00.
Strike It Rich is on.

1288
01:45:41,376 --> 01:45:45,369
- Life isn't about Strike It Rich.
- It's a school night.

1289
01:45:45,547 --> 01:45:49,881
- So what?
- So I don't want to go. I'm happy here.

1290
01:45:51,419 --> 01:45:52,716
It's back on.

1291
01:45:56,191 --> 01:45:59,888
- Do you feel good about music...
- Oh, isn't he handsome?

1292
01:46:01,463 --> 01:46:03,397
Watch with me.

1293
01:46:05,133 --> 01:46:10,400
"You talked me into it," says this
oldie. What's the title of this one?

1294
01:46:13,675 --> 01:46:15,768
"You Made Me Love You."

1295
01:46:15,944 --> 01:46:19,641
"You Made Me Love..."
"You Made Me Love You."

1296
01:46:23,718 --> 01:46:26,346
You get all that from looking
at paint on a canvas...

1297
01:46:26,521 --> 01:46:29,251
...and it's her facial expression...

1298
01:46:29,424 --> 01:46:31,551
...her eyes that makes
you think that.

1299
01:46:31,726 --> 01:46:35,492
- I think that makes it interesting.
- The context that it comes from...

1300
01:46:35,664 --> 01:46:37,188
...affects the way we view it.

1301
01:46:37,365 --> 01:46:40,459
I think it provokes us because
it provoked the painter...

1302
01:46:40,635 --> 01:46:44,002
...and in turn, he's kind of sending
that message to us.

1303
01:46:44,172 --> 01:46:47,733
Whether or not it's a good painting
cannot be subjective.

1304
01:46:47,909 --> 01:46:50,673
I feel like I'm missing something.

1305
01:47:43,698 --> 01:47:45,757
It was Joan's idea.

1306
01:47:50,305 --> 01:47:52,364
How else will you remember us?

1307
01:48:35,617 --> 01:48:38,677
- They've invited you back.
- Do you think they made a mistake?

1308
01:48:38,853 --> 01:48:40,286
I do.

1309
01:48:45,060 --> 01:48:49,292
- Elizabeth, I don't see Spencer.
- Excuse me, Mother.

1310
01:48:49,464 --> 01:48:52,865
Miss Watson, can you help me
get in touch with your friend...

1311
01:48:53,034 --> 01:48:54,296
...in Greenwich Village?

1312
01:48:54,469 --> 01:48:56,903
What do you need
in Greenwich Village?

1313
01:48:57,072 --> 01:48:58,471
An apartment.

1314
01:48:59,974 --> 01:49:02,943
I filed for a divorce this morning.

1315
01:49:04,179 --> 01:49:07,273
And since we know
I'm not welcome at your house...

1316
01:49:08,983 --> 01:49:13,147
You remember Giselle Levy?
What did you call her?

1317
01:49:14,055 --> 01:49:16,523
"A New York kike." That's it.

1318
01:49:17,192 --> 01:49:19,990
Well, we're going to be roommates.

1319
01:49:21,096 --> 01:49:22,859
Hi.

1320
01:49:23,031 --> 01:49:26,523
- You ready?
- Yeah.

1321
01:49:39,114 --> 01:49:40,911
You okay?

1322
01:49:42,951 --> 01:49:45,852
- Greenwich Village?
- Yeah. For a while.

1323
01:49:46,654 --> 01:49:48,884
Then, who knows?

1324
01:49:49,057 --> 01:49:52,356
Maybe law school. Yale, even.

1325
01:49:54,596 --> 01:49:56,393
Well...

1326
01:49:57,065 --> 01:50:01,627
...I wouldn't want to come up against
you in any court anywhere.

1327
01:50:01,803 --> 01:50:04,499
Maybe I can drop by next year?

1328
01:50:04,672 --> 01:50:06,970
Keep you on your toes.

1329
01:50:09,077 --> 01:50:11,170
You will be here?

1330
01:50:11,946 --> 01:50:13,937
Miss Watson?

1331
01:50:20,021 --> 01:50:21,921
Dear Betty:

1332
01:50:22,090 --> 01:50:26,959
I came to Wellesley because
I wanted to make a difference.

1333
01:50:27,529 --> 01:50:29,224
But to change for others...

1334
01:50:29,397 --> 01:50:31,558
- is to lie to yourself.

1335
01:50:31,733 --> 01:50:33,030
My teacher...

1336
01:50:33,201 --> 01:50:36,568
...Katherine Watson,
lived by her own definition...

1337
01:50:36,738 --> 01:50:39,002
...and would not compromise that.

1338
01:50:39,174 --> 01:50:41,870
Not even for Wellesley.

1339
01:50:42,510 --> 01:50:45,343
I dedicate this, my last editorial...

1340
01:50:45,513 --> 01:50:47,481
...to an extraordinary woman...

1341
01:50:47,649 --> 01:50:49,549
...who lived by example...

1342
01:50:49,717 --> 01:50:53,744
...and compelled us all to see
the world through new eyes.

1343
01:50:54,989 --> 01:50:58,857
By the time you read this,
she'll be sailing to Europe...

1344
01:50:59,027 --> 01:51:01,928
...where I know she'll find new walls
to break down...

1345
01:51:02,096 --> 01:51:04,064
...and new ideas
to replace them with.

1346
01:51:04,232 --> 01:51:06,325
Hold it, everybody.

1347
01:51:12,173 --> 01:51:14,471
I've heard her called a quitter
for leaving...

1348
01:51:14,642 --> 01:51:17,110
...an aimless wanderer.

1349
01:51:17,278 --> 01:51:21,476
But not all who wander are aimless.

1350
01:51:21,649 --> 01:51:26,143
Especially not those who seek truth
beyond tradition...

1351
01:51:28,156 --> 01:51:30,386
...beyond definition...

1352
01:51:33,094 --> 01:51:35,153
...beyond the image.

1353
01:51:35,597 --> 01:51:38,088
Get the hell out of the way!

1354
01:51:47,609 --> 01:51:49,804
I'll never forget you.

1355
01:51:55,083 --> 01:51:59,315
Betty! Betty!

1356
01:52:29,017 --> 01:52:30,644
What about after this war, Lee?

1357
01:52:30,818 --> 01:52:33,582
Well, this job belongs
to some soldier.

1358
01:52:33,755 --> 01:52:35,017
When he comes back...

1359
01:52:35,189 --> 01:52:37,623
...he can have it.
- Oh, that's swell.
