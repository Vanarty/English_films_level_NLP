00:11:42,469 --> 00:11:44,171
You've got his head
on backwards.

184
00:11:44,238 --> 00:11:47,474
SECOND DOCTOR:
Well, twist it around.

185
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:50,241
OK, that's enough.

186
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:56,183
Now, cut!

187
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:58,252
How are you doing,
Irving?

188
00:11:58,318 --> 00:11:59,986
Be finished in a minute.

189
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:03,890
Nurse!

190
00:12:03,957 --> 00:12:06,893
[Clanking]

191
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,729
There, we've finished.

192
00:12:08,796 --> 00:12:10,664
The statue
looks just like new.

193
00:12:10,731 --> 00:12:13,100
When the cement dries,
he can go back on the roof.

194
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:14,435
How about the man
who fell with him?

195
00:12:14,501 --> 00:12:15,703
How's he doing?

196
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:20,173
Not bad. Dr Moonstone
is taking care of him.

197
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,443
Dr Moonstone,
I'm Chief Boulder,

198
00:12:22,509 --> 00:12:25,011
head of this country's
Secret Service.

199
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:27,247
And your patient
is Rock Slag,

200
00:12:27,314 --> 00:12:29,049
my best agent.

201
00:12:29,116 --> 00:12:30,551
Thanks, Chief.

202
00:12:30,618 --> 00:12:33,554
CHIEF: Doc, you must get Rock
back on his feet quickly.

203
00:12:33,621 --> 00:12:35,623
He's the only agent
I have capable

204
00:12:35,689 --> 00:12:37,658
of carrying out
a very important

205
00:12:37,725 --> 00:12:40,093
and dangerous
mission.

206
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,129
Rock Slag survive fall.

207
00:12:42,195 --> 00:12:44,364
He is still alive, Bobo.

208
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:48,636
Our work is
not done, Ali.

209
00:12:48,702 --> 00:12:50,537
Mr Slag can
leave any time.

210
00:12:50,604 --> 00:12:52,372
He just bruised
a few ribs.

211
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:53,808
So, now if you'll
excuse me,

212
00:12:53,874 --> 00:12:56,276
I'll just look in
on my other patients.

213
00:12:56,343 --> 00:12:58,545
Sure, Doc, sure.
And, uh, thanks.

214
00:12:58,612 --> 00:13:00,247
That's great news.

215
00:13:00,314 --> 00:13:02,449
What's this important
mission, Chief?

216
00:13:02,516 --> 00:13:04,217
The biggest yet.

217
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:06,153
You're going
to eliminate the guy

218
00:13:06,219 --> 00:13:07,822
that tried
to eliminate you.

219
00:13:07,888 --> 00:13:10,957
ROCK: You mean
the Green Goose.

220
00:13:11,024 --> 00:13:11,892
Yes!

221
00:13:11,959 --> 00:13:13,961
Intelligence reports
he has a weapon

222
00:13:14,028 --> 00:13:17,164
so powerful he could
destroy the world.

223
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:19,233
And probably will,
unless--

224
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:20,501
NURSE: Rock Slag!

225
00:13:20,568 --> 00:13:25,038
Ooh! [Growls]

226
00:13:25,105 --> 00:13:29,410
Mmm! [Giggles]

227
00:13:29,476 --> 00:13:31,278
Unless
he is stopped.

228
00:13:31,345 --> 00:13:32,513
So you see, Slag,

229
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:35,282
the safety of every man,
woman, and child

230
00:13:35,349 --> 00:13:37,651
in every country
depends on you.

231
00:13:37,718 --> 00:13:40,320
On me? Why me, Chief?

232
00:13:40,387 --> 00:13:42,623
CHIEF: It has
to be you, Rock Slag.

233
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:46,440
Rock Slag!
Yum, yum, yum!

234
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:49,563
Mmm!

235
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:53,934
[Squeals and giggles]

236
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,536
There's your answer.

237
00:13:55,603 --> 00:13:58,838
You have an uncontrollable
appeal to women.

238
00:13:58,905 --> 00:14:00,507
Yes, I know.

239
00:14:00,574 --> 00:14:02,310
But how can
that help us, Chief?

240
00:14:02,377 --> 00:14:05,479
CHIEF: We're going to put
your gift to good use.

241
00:14:05,546 --> 00:14:07,314
How, Chief?

242
00:14:07,381 --> 00:14:08,682
Through Tanya,

243
00:14:08,749 --> 00:14:11,251
the Green Goose's
number one lieutenant.

244
00:14:11,318 --> 00:14:12,753
She's heard
about you, Rock.

245
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:15,188
And she wants
to meet you so badly,

246
00:14:15,255 --> 00:14:16,624
she's made a deal
with us

247
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:19,159
to turn the Green Goose
over to you!

248
00:14:19,226 --> 00:14:20,561
To me?

249
00:14:20,628 --> 00:14:21,695
That's the deal.

250
00:14:21,762 --> 00:14:23,464
You're going
to meet her in Paris.

251
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:24,698
When do I leave, Chief?

252
00:14:24,765 --> 00:14:26,734
At once.
I'll call the office

253
00:14:26,801 --> 00:14:31,801
and have them get
your plane ticket.

254
00:14:35,409 --> 00:14:39,379
At last,
Rock Slag is alone!

255
00:14:39,446 --> 00:14:43,346
Now we can finish
the job.

256
00:14:45,753 --> 00:14:48,989
ALI: Hello, Rock Slag.

257
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:51,558
Ali! Bobo!

258
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:54,394
You're taking
a trip, Slag.

259
00:14:54,461 --> 00:14:57,264
A one-way trip, huh?

260
00:14:57,331 --> 00:15:01,831
Hee hee! Hee hee
hee! Hee hee!

261
00:15:16,149 --> 00:15:18,485
This time we got him, Ali.

262
00:15:18,552 --> 00:15:21,388
Rock Slag is
finished, Bobo!

263
00:15:21,455 --> 00:15:22,556
Hee hee! Hee hee
hee! Hee hee!

264
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:26,361
Ho ho! Ho ho!
Hee hee! Hee hee!

265
00:15:26,427 --> 00:15:29,596
With Rock back on the job,
the Green Goose's goose

266
00:15:29,663 --> 00:15:32,399
is as good as cooked
right now.

267
00:15:32,466 --> 00:15:34,935
Rock! What happened?

268
00:15:35,002 --> 00:15:37,337
While you were gone
I had visitors, Chief.

269
00:15:37,404 --> 00:15:39,005
Ali and Bobo?

270
00:15:39,072 --> 00:15:41,308
Right. The goon twins.

271
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:42,409
CHIEF: Well,
that does it.

272
00:15:42,476 --> 00:15:44,545
Tanya will never
go for you.

273
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:45,880
You're a mess!

274
00:15:45,946 --> 00:15:48,615
That cooks
our Green Goose.

275
00:15:48,682 --> 00:15:50,818
I'll try
to heal fast, Chief.

276
00:15:50,885 --> 00:15:52,920
It won't be
fast enough, Rock.

277
00:15:52,987 --> 00:15:55,188
At any moment,
the Green Goose may decide

278
00:15:55,255 --> 00:15:56,757
to take over the world.

279
00:15:56,824 --> 00:16:01,094
I'd better cancel
your trip to Paris.

280
00:16:01,161 --> 00:16:02,730
Is this the patient?

281
00:16:02,796 --> 00:16:04,698
Uh, yeah, Doc.
Fred Flintstone.

282
00:16:04,765 --> 00:16:05,866
He fell on his head.

283
00:16:05,933 --> 00:16:08,069
I'm OK now, Doc.
I feel fine.

284
00:16:08,135 --> 00:16:10,504
Well, why don't we
check you over anyway?

285
00:16:10,571 --> 00:16:12,006
Come with me,
Mr Flintstone.

286
00:16:12,073 --> 00:16:17,073
OK, but I'm telling you,
it's a waste of time.

287
00:16:17,411 --> 00:16:19,747
Hmm. Your pulse seems
to be normal.

288
00:16:19,813 --> 00:16:21,548
Right on the button,
in fact.

289
00:16:21,615 --> 00:16:22,850
Now cross your legs,

290
00:16:22,917 --> 00:16:24,785
and we'll test
your reflexes.

291
00:16:24,852 --> 00:16:26,319
Make it snappy,
will ya, Doc?

292
00:16:26,386 --> 00:16:27,487
I'm on my vacation.

293
00:16:27,554 --> 00:16:30,854
We're almost finished.

294
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:34,194
Reflex is normal.

295
00:16:34,261 --> 00:16:35,896
[Mumbling]

296
00:16:35,963 --> 00:16:37,765
You can leave now,
Mr Flintstone.

297
00:16:37,832 --> 00:16:40,434
Right after I give you
a booster shot.

298
00:16:40,501 --> 00:16:41,769
Best to play it safe,
you know.

299
00:16:41,836 --> 00:16:43,271
Yeah, yeah,
yeah, all right.

300
00:16:43,338 --> 00:16:45,039
Let's have the shot, Doc.
I wanna get out of here.

301
00:16:45,106 --> 00:16:47,508
DOCTOR: You won't even
feel this, Mr Flintstone.

302
00:16:47,574 --> 00:16:50,778
FRED: Yeow!
Watch it, Doc!

303
00:16:50,845 --> 00:16:51,879
What are you
trying to do,

304
00:16:51,946 --> 00:16:54,414
put me
in the hospital?

305
00:16:54,481 --> 00:16:55,916
It's amazing!

306
00:16:55,983 --> 00:17:00,983
That man is a dead ringer
for Rock Slag!

307
00:17:01,922 --> 00:17:04,058
Look at the size
of this needle.

308
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:06,660
What do you think I am,
a brontosaurus?

309
00:17:06,727 --> 00:17:10,664
Why, he could be
Rock's twin!

310
00:17:10,731 --> 00:17:15,536
His twin!
I wonder if--

311
00:17:15,602 --> 00:17:19,105
Why not?
It's worth a try.

312
00:17:19,172 --> 00:17:20,041
Pardon me, sir.

313
00:17:20,107 --> 00:17:21,941
Can I have a word
with you?

314
00:17:22,008 --> 00:17:22,776
Who, me?

315
00:17:22,843 --> 00:17:23,811
CHIEF: Yes.

316
00:17:23,878 --> 00:17:25,746
Your country
needs you.

317
00:17:25,813 --> 00:17:30,013
My country needsme?!

318
00:17:31,719 --> 00:17:33,854
Now, let's see
if i got this straight.

319
00:17:33,921 --> 00:17:36,623
The government will
send me and my family

320
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:38,926
to Paris to pick up
a Green Goose

321
00:17:38,993 --> 00:17:41,161
because I look
like this guy?

322
00:17:41,228 --> 00:17:42,263
Right, Mr Flintstone.

323
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:44,698
Your resemblance
to our regular messenger

324
00:17:44,765 --> 00:17:45,799
is fantastic!

325
00:17:45,866 --> 00:17:47,201
And as you can see,

326
00:17:47,268 --> 00:17:48,903
he's in no condition
to make the trip.

327
00:17:48,969 --> 00:17:51,638
FRED: Yeah,
I can see that.

328
00:17:51,705 --> 00:17:53,574
This Green Goose
must be

329
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,542
a very valuable
bird.

330
00:17:55,609 --> 00:17:57,111
Very valuable.

331
00:17:57,178 --> 00:18:00,781
Our government wants
to put him in a cage.

332
00:18:00,848 --> 00:18:03,284
I had planned a camping
trip this year,

333
00:18:03,351 --> 00:18:08,255
but, uh, you did say
"all expenses paid"?

334
00:18:08,321 --> 00:18:10,091
Every last penny.

335
00:18:10,157 --> 00:18:12,225
In that case, I'll be
glad to help the government

336
00:18:12,292 --> 00:18:13,360
get the Green Goose.

337
00:18:13,427 --> 00:18:14,394
CHIEF: Good.

338
00:18:14,461 --> 00:18:15,696
Now, raise
your right hand.

339
00:18:15,763 --> 00:18:16,730
My right hand?

340
00:18:16,797 --> 00:18:17,964
And repeat after me.

341
00:18:18,031 --> 00:18:18,999
OK.

342
00:18:19,066 --> 00:18:21,001
I will not reveal
my mission to anyone.

343
00:18:21,068 --> 00:18:23,403
I will not reveal
my mission to anyone.

344
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:24,438
Not even my wife.

345
00:18:24,504 --> 00:18:27,441
Not even my...
wife?!

346
00:18:27,507 --> 00:18:28,675
Congratulations.

347
00:18:28,742 --> 00:18:31,177
You are now an official
secret agent.

348
00:18:31,244 --> 00:18:33,847
Gosh! [Laughs]

349
00:18:33,914 --> 00:18:36,316

our only chance.

finds out we failed,

588
00:29:22,329 --> 00:29:25,065
there'll be plenty
of scratches onus.

Why is the flight deck
way up here, pilot?

604
00:30:21,822 --> 00:30:23,424
Well, it's a big
aeroplane,

605
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:25,959
so we use jet propulsion
to get airborne.

606
00:30:26,026 --> 00:30:27,294
Jet propulsion?

607
00:30:27,361 --> 00:30:28,863
Yeah. You see,
the plane is attached

608
00:30:28,930 --> 00:30:31,365
to that launching device
at the edge of the cliff.

609
00:30:31,432 --> 00:30:34,001
When the pilot is ready,
he gives the signal,

610
00:30:34,068 --> 00:30:37,003
the launching crew
releases the retaining rope,

611
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:38,940
and the plane takes off.

00:45:10,344 --> 00:45:11,311
Good night, Betty.

897
00:45:11,378 --> 00:45:12,813
Uh, night, you two.

898
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:15,783
I'm not tired, Fred.
I'd love to go dancing.

899
00:45:15,850 --> 00:45:18,819
You just made yourself
a date, honey.

900
00:45:18,886 --> 00:45:20,654
We'll find ourselves
a good night club

901
00:45:20,721 --> 00:45:23,223
and a great band,
and whip it up.

902
00:45:23,290 --> 00:45:26,740
Oh, it sounds like fun.

903
00:45:28,828 --> 00:45:30,497
Shh! It's me.

904
00:45:30,564 --> 00:45:32,099
How did you
make out, Flintstone?

905
00:45:32,165 --> 00:45:33,634
You gave me a bum
steer, Chief.

906
00:45:33,701 --> 00:45:35,335
Nobody called me
Bubala.

907
00:45:35,402 --> 00:45:37,938
Hmm. There's another
girl in the garden.

908
00:45:38,004 --> 00:45:39,373
She may be
the right one.

909
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:40,808
OK, I'll go talk to her,

910
00:45:40,875 --> 00:45:44,111
but first I gotta
keep Wilma busy.

911
00:45:44,177 --> 00:45:45,947
Will we be staying out
late, Fred?

912
00:45:46,013 --> 00:45:48,482
Uh, yeah.
Why don't you put Pebbles

913
00:45:48,549 --> 00:45:50,050
in with Betty and Barney,

914
00:45:50,117 --> 00:45:51,184
and then while
you're doing that

915
00:45:51,251 --> 00:45:53,353
I'll phone ahead
and reserve a table.

916
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:55,623
All right. I'll wait
for you upstairs.

917
00:45:55,689 --> 00:45:57,391
I'll be with you
in 5 minutes, honey,

918
00:45:57,458 --> 00:46:00,260
not a second longer.

919
00:46:00,327 --> 00:46:01,462
3, please.

920
00:46:01,528 --> 00:46:06,528
Yes-a, ma'am.
Take her up, George.

921
00:46:08,835 --> 00:46:10,170
Whoa, Matilda.

922
00:46:10,237 --> 00:46:13,607
Third floor!

923
00:46:13,674 --> 00:46:15,309
Isn't that sweet?

924
00:46:15,375 --> 00:46:16,744
Pebbles is so tired,

925
00:46:16,811 --> 00:46:19,446
she doesn't even
know you moved her.

926
00:46:19,513 --> 00:46:20,648
Thanks, Betty.

927
00:46:20,714 --> 00:46:25,714
I'll pick Pebbles up
in the morning.

It's me!

968
00:49:19,493 --> 00:49:20,861
Rockello!

969
00:49:20,928 --> 00:49:23,731
Oh, darling!

I give up. Anyway,
you know why I'm here.

973
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:36,243
Oh, yes, my darling,
I know.

974
00:49:36,309 --> 00:49:37,644
My brother Mario,

975
00:49:37,711 --> 00:49:39,513
he's-a come here
for the wedding.

976
00:49:39,580 --> 00:49:41,981
How nice!
Whose wedding?

977
00:49:42,048 --> 00:49:42,917
Ours!

978
00:49:42,983 --> 00:49:45,252
Well, I hope
you'll be very happy.

979
00:49:45,318 --> 00:49:47,053
Ours?!

980
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:48,288
Let's-a go.

981
00:49:48,355 --> 00:49:49,322
Where?

982
00:49:49,389 --> 00:49:50,691
To get
the licence.

983
00:49:50,758 --> 00:49:53,360
Uh...oh...sure.

984
00:49:53,427 --> 00:49:55,562
Eh...after you,
my dear.

985
00:49:55,629 --> 00:49:57,832
Hee hee hee hee. Oh...

986
00:49:57,898 --> 00:50:01,635
Oh, we'll-a be so happy,
Rockello!

987
00:50:01,702 --> 00:50:03,604
Rockello?

988
00:50:03,671 --> 00:50:08,021
Mario,
Rockello, he's-a gone!

989
00:50:09,510 --> 00:50:12,746
Have you found him
yet, Mario?

990
00:50:12,813 --> 00:50:15,549
Not yet,
little sister.

991
00:50:15,616 --> 00:50:18,251
Aha!

992
00:50:18,318 --> 00:50:19,386
Stop!

993
00:50:19,453 --> 00:50:23,457
Stop! This-a way,
Roberta!

994
00:50:23,524 --> 00:50:25,292
This is far enough,
driver.

995
00:50:25,359 --> 00:50:28,495
Oui, monsieur.

996
00:50:28,562 --> 00:50:30,564
Hey, taxi!

997
00:50:30,631 --> 00:50:34,735
Taxi!

998
00:50:34,802 --> 00:50:37,805
Let's see...
Paris to Rome...

999
00:50:37,872 --> 00:50:41,274
That will be 1 million
francs, monsieur.

1000
00:50:41,341 --> 00:50:43,143
How much?

1001
00:50:43,210 --> 00:50:45,345
How about for free,

1002
00:50:45,412 --> 00:50:46,613
oui?

1003
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:49,550
Hey, taxi!
Wait for me!

1004
00:50:49,616 --> 00:50:53,754
All right, cabbie.
Beat it.

1005
00:50:53,821 --> 00:50:57,023
Wait! Hold that cab!

1006
00:50:57,090 --> 00:51:00,026
Wait! [Panting]

1007
00:51:00,093 --> 00:51:01,395
G-gentlemen...

1008
00:51:01,461 --> 00:51:03,764
please h-help me
get outta here.

1009
00:51:03,831 --> 00:51:05,532
There's a couple
after me

1010
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:07,801
who think
I'm somebody else.

1011
00:51:07,868 --> 00:51:09,503
It's Rock Slag!

1012
00:51:09,570 --> 00:51:12,573
Ha ha! He doesn't
recognize us.

1013
00:51:12,639 --> 00:51:15,208
Must have took
too many knocks on the head.

1014
00:51:15,275 --> 00:51:17,143
Sure, mister!

1015
00:51:17,210 --> 00:51:18,946
We help you.

1016
00:51:19,013 --> 00:51:21,314
Yeah, yeah.
We'll hide you...

1017
00:51:21,381 --> 00:51:22,549
permanently.

1018
00:51:22,616 --> 00:51:27,521
Hee hee! Hee hee hee!
Hee hee! Hee hee!

1019
00:51:27,588 --> 00:51:30,156
I sure appreciate this,
fellas.

1020
00:51:30,223 --> 00:51:31,458
ROBERTA:
Rockello!

1021
00:51:31,525 --> 00:51:35,495
Blast off, fellas,
quick!

1022
00:51:35,562 --> 00:51:36,897
Darling!

1023
00:51:36,964 --> 00:51:40,233
Don't-a worry.
We follow.

1024
00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:41,435
Here they come!

1025
00:51:41,501 --> 00:51:44,271
And they're gaing
on us!

1026
00:51:44,337 --> 00:51:47,441
Faster, Mario!
Faster!

1027
00:51:47,507 --> 00:51:49,443
We'll lose them
on the steps.

1028
00:51:49,509 --> 00:51:50,709
Hang on!

1029
00:51:59,220 --> 00:52:01,521
No good!
They're still coming!

1030
00:52:01,588 --> 00:52:06,588
I make a fast left
up the next alley.

1031
00:52:06,794 --> 00:52:08,462
Here's one.

1032
00:52:08,528 --> 00:52:10,430
Hey, fellas!

1033
00:52:10,497 --> 00:52:13,834
Wait!

1034
00:52:13,901 --> 00:52:17,337
Oh, boy! I can't
stop this thing!

1035
00:52:17,404 --> 00:52:18,304
Uh-oh!

1036
00:52:24,912 --> 00:52:26,580
A tour of Rome

1037
00:52:26,647 --> 00:52:27,915
would be great

1038
00:52:27,982 --> 00:52:29,683
but this is ridiculous!

1039
00:52:29,750 --> 00:52:30,500
Help!

1040
00:52:37,658 --> 00:52:39,008
Rockello!

1041
00:52:43,030 --> 00:52:45,599
Here she comes!
Oh, brother.

1042
00:52:45,666 --> 00:52:48,816
What a spot to be in.

1043
00:52:55,109 --> 00:53:00,109
Don't stop. He must
be on that train!

1044
00:53:03,184 --> 00:53:07,086
They're gone. Now to
get back to the hotel.

1045
00:53:07,153 --> 00:53:08,922
Oh, no!

1046
00:53:08,989 --> 00:53:11,392
"Rome, 50 miles"?

1047
00:53:11,459 --> 00:53:16,459
And I told Wilma
I'd be back in 5 minutes.

1048
00:53:27,808 --> 00:53:29,342
Oh, boy.

1049
00:53:29,409 --> 00:53:31,212
6.00 in the morning.

1050
00:53:31,279 --> 00:53:35,482
How will I ever
explain this to Wilma?

1051
00:53:35,549 --> 00:53:37,684
Hey, bud.

1052
00:53:37,751 --> 00:53:39,519
Who, me?

1053
00:53:39,586 --> 00:53:41,354
Yeah, You.

1054
00:53:41,421 --> 00:53:43,023
Wanna buy
some genuine

1055
00:53:43,090 --> 00:53:45,159
Italian leopard
skin ties?

1056
00:53:45,226 --> 00:53:47,694
No, thanks.
I have a tie.

1057
00:53:47,761 --> 00:53:49,696
Shaving lotion,
nail clippers,

1058
00:53:49,763 --> 00:53:51,331
hubcaps,
fountain pens,

1059
00:53:51,398 --> 00:53:52,365
a gold watch?

1060
00:53:52,432 --> 00:53:54,001
I don't need anything.

1061
00:53:54,068 --> 00:53:56,170
Then how about something
for the little lady,

1062
00:53:56,237 --> 00:54:00,941
like a genuine imitation
diamond necklace, maybe?

1063
00:54:01,008 --> 00:54:02,910
A diamond necklace?

1064
00:54:02,977 --> 00:54:05,378
Are you sure it's a real
genuine imitation

1065
00:54:05,445 --> 00:54:06,446
diamond necklace?

1066
00:54:06,513 --> 00:54:08,281
I guarantee it.

1067
00:54:08,348 --> 00:54:10,450
Wow!

1068
00:54:10,517 --> 00:54:12,119
How much?

1069
00:54:12,186 --> 00:54:15,823
Would you consider
a dollar and a quarter?

1070
00:54:15,889 --> 00:54:18,192
75 cents?

1071
00:54:18,259 --> 00:54:22,263
It's yours
for 2 bits, bud.

1072
00:54:22,330 --> 00:54:24,798
I don't know if this'll
square me with Wilma,

1073
00:54:24,865 --> 00:54:29,837
but it's worth a try.

1074
00:54:29,903 --> 00:54:31,238
She'll probably
throw a lamp at me

1075
00:54:31,305 --> 00:54:35,709
the minute I walk in,
but here goes.

1076
00:54:35,776 --> 00:54:38,546
Wilma! Look, surprise.

1077
00:54:38,613 --> 00:54:43,613
I spent all night
shopping...for...it...

1078
00:54:44,918 --> 00:54:46,586
Well, what do you know?

1079
00:54:46,653 --> 00:54:49,456
She's asleep.

1080
00:54:49,523 --> 00:54:50,723
[Riiing]

1081
00:55:00,266 --> 00:55:01,035
Fred?

1082
00:55:01,101 --> 00:55:02,302
Morning, Wilma.

1083
00:55:02,369 --> 00:55:04,671
1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2--

1084
00:55:04,738 --> 00:55:06,940
Wha--wh--whe--
What time is it, Fred?

1085
00:55:07,007 --> 00:55:08,675
7.00 in the morning,
dear.

1086
00:55:08,742 --> 00:55:12,779
7.00? Oh, no!
I slept all night!

1087
00:55:12,846 --> 00:55:14,248
Why didn't you
wake me?

1088
00:55:14,315 --> 00:55:16,183
Aw, you looked
so comfortable,

1089
00:55:16,250 --> 00:55:18,285
I didn't have the heart to,
sweetheart.

1090
00:55:18,352 --> 00:55:21,722
Oh, Fred, I ruined
your whole evening!

1091
00:55:21,788 --> 00:55:23,057
I feel terrible!

1092
00:55:23,123 --> 00:55:25,993
Perfectly all right, honey.
Think nothing of it.

1093
00:55:26,060 --> 00:55:29,497
Oh, you're
so wonderful.

1094
00:55:29,564 --> 00:55:31,899
I'll fix some breakfast
while you get dressed.

1095
00:55:31,965 --> 00:55:34,601
OK, sweetheart.

1096
00:55:34,668 --> 00:55:36,303
Boy, that was close.

1097
00:55:36,370 --> 00:55:38,339
This spy job
is too much for me.

1098
00:55:38,406 --> 00:55:40,974
I gotta find the Chief
and quit.

1099
00:55:41,041 --> 00:55:44,445
Look, Fred. There's a park
across the street.

1100
00:55:44,512 --> 00:55:46,514
Let's take the children
there after breakfast.

1101
00:55:46,581 --> 00:55:50,717
Good idea. I'll tell
Barney and Betty about it.

1102
00:55:50,784 --> 00:55:53,854
I'll be right back,
Wilma.

1103
00:55:53,921 --> 00:55:55,322
Now to find Triple X.

1104
00:55:55,389 --> 00:55:59,589
He can take me
to the Chief.

1105
00:56:00,961 --> 00:56:03,464
What luck!
Here he comes.

1106
00:56:03,531 --> 00:56:06,033
I was just lookin'
for you, Triple X.

1107
00:56:06,100 --> 00:56:09,636
I gotta see the Chief.
Very important.

1108
00:56:09,703 --> 00:56:13,774
Yeeow!

1109
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:16,210
Triple X is such
a master of disguise,

1110
00:56:16,277 --> 00:56:17,811
he could be anyone.

1111
00:56:17,878 --> 00:56:20,747
Excuse me, sonny.

1112
00:56:20,814 --> 00:56:23,364
Even an old lady.

1113
00:56:26,586 --> 00:56:29,355
Triple X, right?

1114
00:56:29,422 --> 00:56:31,058
Fresh.

1115
00:56:31,125 --> 00:56:34,928
[Baby cries]

1116
00:56:34,995 --> 00:56:37,998
Hey, Trip!

1117
00:56:38,065 --> 00:56:42,565
Take me to the Chief,
will ya?

1118
00:56:46,907 --> 00:56:48,976
Well, he's not up here.

1119
00:56:49,043 --> 00:56:54,043
I'll take the elevator
down to the lobby.

1120
00:56:56,050 --> 00:56:57,217
Flintstone!

1121
00:56:57,283 --> 00:56:58,219
Chief!

1122
00:56:58,285 --> 00:57:00,287
How did you find
my secret headquarters?

1123
00:57:00,354 --> 00:57:02,556
Secret?
In an elevator?

1124
00:57:02,622 --> 00:57:03,857
Get in here, quick!

1125
00:57:03,924 --> 00:57:06,760
OK, OK.

1126
00:57:06,827 --> 00:57:08,229
I wanna talk to you,
Chief.

1127
00:57:08,295 --> 00:57:10,797
Hold it, Flintstone.
This room may be bugged.

1128
00:57:10,864 --> 00:57:13,466
Bugged?

1129
00:57:13,533 --> 00:57:14,569
Nothing there.

1130
00:57:14,635 --> 00:57:16,870
Chief, I'm quittin'
this job right now.

1131
00:57:16,937 --> 00:57:18,305
You can't quit.

1132
00:57:18,372 --> 00:57:20,307
Not before you pick up
the Green Goose.

1133
00:57:20,374 --> 00:57:23,043
Oh, anybody
can pick up a bird.

1134
00:57:23,110 --> 00:57:24,778
You don't need me
for that.

1135
00:57:24,845 --> 00:57:26,080
Quiet.

1136
00:57:26,146 --> 00:57:29,917
[Beep beep beep beep]

1137
00:57:29,983 --> 00:57:31,051
How about that?

1138
00:57:31,118 --> 00:57:34,521
They had my bed bugged!

1139
00:57:34,588 --> 00:57:36,290
All right, Flintstone.

1140
00:57:36,357 --> 00:57:38,192
I see I'm going to have
to level with you.

1141
00:57:38,259 --> 00:57:39,360
What do you mean?

1142
00:57:39,427 --> 00:57:42,696
I mean the Green Goose
is not a bird.

1143
00:57:42,763 --> 00:57:44,098
He's a master criminal

1144
00:57:44,164 --> 00:57:46,700
who plans to take over
the world!

1145
00:57:46,767 --> 00:57:48,068
Why don't you
arrest him?

1146
00:57:48,135 --> 00:57:50,804
No one knows who he is
or what he looks like.

1147
00:57:50,871 --> 00:57:52,372
But you can find out.

1148
00:57:52,439 --> 00:57:53,907
Me?! How?

1149
00:57:53,974 --> 00:57:55,742
Through a girl
named Tanya

1150
00:57:55,809 --> 00:57:57,578
who thinks
you're Rock Slag.

1151
00:57:57,645 --> 00:57:59,547
The minute she identifies
the Green Goose,

1152
00:57:59,614 --> 00:58:02,682
I'll grab him,
and your job is done.

1153
00:58:02,749 --> 00:58:04,484
How about it,
Flintstone?

1154
00:58:04,551 --> 00:58:06,186
Nothin' doin'!

1155
00:58:06,253 --> 00:58:07,788
Too dangerous!

1156
00:58:07,854 --> 00:58:09,990
I got a family
to think of--

1157
00:58:10,057 --> 00:58:11,158
Pebbles' future!

1158
00:58:11,225 --> 00:58:13,026
If we don't stop
the Green Goose,

1159
00:58:13,093 --> 00:58:14,928
Pebbles won't have
a future.

1160
00:58:14,995 --> 00:58:15,996
Sorry, Chief.

1161
00:58:16,063 --> 00:58:21,013
You'll have to get
somebody else.

1162
00:58:22,369 --> 00:58:24,271
Oh, look at those
children, Fred.

1163
00:58:24,338 --> 00:58:26,273
They're having the time
of their lives!

1164
00:58:26,340 --> 00:58:28,476
BARNEY: Ha ha ha!
Why not?

1165
00:58:28,542 --> 00:58:30,277
They got nothin'
to worry about.

1166
00:58:30,344 --> 00:58:32,446
Right, Fred?
Huh?

1167
00:58:32,513 --> 00:58:35,082
I said those kids got
nothin' to worry about.

get along together?

Yeah. We adults could take
a lesson from them.

1223
01:01:16,878 --> 01:01:20,981
What do we do now, Fred,
some sightseeing?

1224
01:01:21,048 --> 01:01:22,949
Fred? Do you hear me?

1225
01:01:23,016 --> 01:01:23,984
What?

1226
01:01:24,051 --> 01:01:26,821
Oh, uh, yeah, yeah.
Good idea.

1227
01:01:26,888 --> 01:01:30,057
You, uh...go ahead
and enjoy yourselves.

1228
01:01:30,123 --> 01:01:31,659
But aren't you coming
with us?

1229
01:01:31,726 --> 01:01:34,194
No. I got some
unfinished business

1230
01:01:34,261 --> 01:01:37,331
to take care of.

1231
01:01:37,398 --> 01:01:39,032
So long, honey.

1232
01:01:39,099 --> 01:01:41,101
See you later.

1233
01:01:41,168 --> 01:01:43,404
My, he's acting
strange.

1234
01:01:43,470 --> 01:01:46,770
I wonder what's
wrong?

1235
01:01:48,609 --> 01:01:50,877
I knew you'd change
your mind, Flintstone.

1236
01:01:50,944 --> 01:01:52,446
You're A-OK.

1237
01:01:52,513 --> 01:01:54,915
Are you sure this
is the right girl?

1238
01:01:54,981 --> 01:01:55,982
Absolutely.

1239
01:01:56,049 --> 01:01:57,284
You're having lunch
with her

1240
01:01:57,351 --> 01:02:01,422
at Papa Piccolo's
Pizza Palace.

1241
01:02:01,488 --> 01:02:06,488
Here we are, Flintstone.
Let's go inside.

1242
01:02:06,993 --> 01:02:09,029
There she is. Tanya.

1243
01:02:09,096 --> 01:02:10,197
The girl
who will lead us

1244
01:02:10,264 --> 01:02:11,932
to the Green Goose's
hideout.

1245
01:02:11,998 --> 01:02:15,836
Rrr! She's a doll.

1246
01:02:15,903 --> 01:02:18,439
Your job will be simpler
than we thought, Flintstone.

1247
01:02:18,505 --> 01:02:21,842
Rock Slag has recovered
and will be here within a hour.

1248
01:02:21,909 --> 01:02:24,778
All you have to do is keep
Tanya here until he arrives.

1249
01:02:24,844 --> 01:02:26,280
Think you can do it?

1250
01:02:26,346 --> 01:02:27,648
It'll be a cinch.

1251
01:02:27,715 --> 01:02:29,516
I'll order everything
on the menu.

1252
01:02:29,583 --> 01:02:32,185
Wait. I want you to wear
this recorder.

1253
01:02:32,252 --> 01:02:33,587
Recorder?

1254
01:02:33,654 --> 01:02:36,791
Yes. We wanna take down
everything Tanya says.

1255
01:02:36,857 --> 01:02:39,159
I'm glad I had
my beak sharpened.

1256
01:02:39,226 --> 01:02:43,063
Tanya may be
a real yacker.

1257
01:02:43,130 --> 01:02:44,665
This flower
is the microphone.

1258
01:02:44,732 --> 01:02:46,266
And remember,
keep her talking

1259
01:02:46,333 --> 01:02:48,268
until the real Rock Slag
takes over.

1260
01:02:48,335 --> 01:02:51,472
Gotcha, Chief.

1261
01:02:51,538 --> 01:02:53,040
BETTY:
Oh, how exciting!

1262
01:02:53,107 --> 01:02:56,276
The famous Papa Piccolo's
Pizza Palace.

1263
01:02:56,343 --> 01:02:58,245
Let's go in
and have some lunch.

1264
01:02:58,312 --> 01:03:02,416
Poor Fred. It's a shame
he isn't here.

1265
01:03:02,483 --> 01:03:05,285
Fifty flying
firefighters?

1266
01:03:05,352 --> 01:03:06,320
Mmm...

1267
01:03:06,386 --> 01:03:07,621
Bubala!

1268
01:03:07,688 --> 01:03:10,724
Ha ha ha.
Hello, Tanya.

1269
01:03:10,791 --> 01:03:13,827
Rock Slag.
At last we meet.

1270
01:03:13,893 --> 01:03:14,895
May I sit down?

1271
01:03:14,962 --> 01:03:17,531
Is that wise?
We should leave at once.

1272
01:03:17,598 --> 01:03:19,433
Oh, plenty of time.

1273
01:03:19,500 --> 01:03:21,301
Let's have
a little talk first

1274
01:03:21,368 --> 01:03:23,004
about, uh...
you know who.

1275
01:03:23,071 --> 01:03:26,908
Oh, the Green Goose.
He's a terrible man!

1276
01:03:26,974 --> 01:03:29,510
Do you know
he has a secret weapon

1277
01:03:29,577 --> 01:03:31,245
more powerful
than any?

1278
01:03:31,311 --> 01:03:33,080
A little louder, please,

1279
01:03:33,146 --> 01:03:35,182
and speak into
the flower.

1280
01:03:35,249 --> 01:03:37,984
How cute. I will
wear it in my hair.

1281
01:03:38,051 --> 01:03:38,920
No, no, no.

1282
01:03:38,986 --> 01:03:41,088
Allow me to get you
a fresh flower.

1283
01:03:41,154 --> 01:03:42,389
I'll be right back.

1284
01:03:42,456 --> 01:03:44,391
Toodle-oo!

1285
01:03:44,458 --> 01:03:45,625
Fred!

1286
01:03:45,692 --> 01:03:46,460
Wilma!

1287
01:03:46,527 --> 01:03:47,661
What are you
doing here?

1288
01:03:47,728 --> 01:03:49,363
And who are you
waving at?

1289
01:03:49,430 --> 01:03:51,898
Wa-wa-waving?
Who--who's waving?

1290
01:03:51,965 --> 01:03:53,667
Oh, that! Ha ha ha!

1291
01:03:53,734 --> 01:03:55,969
It's just a loose wrist.

1292
01:03:56,036 --> 01:03:56,971
I thought you had

1293
01:03:57,038 --> 01:03:59,239
some unfinished business
to take care of.

1294
01:03:59,306 --> 01:04:02,610
Well, I do.
That is, I finished.

1295
01:04:02,676 --> 01:04:04,578
I took a chance
you might be here,

1296
01:04:04,645 --> 01:04:07,013
so...ha ha...
here I am.

1297
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:08,716
Oh, how nice!

1298
01:04:08,783 --> 01:04:10,183
Well, sit down,
Fred.

1299
01:04:10,250 --> 01:04:12,252
Yeah!
Join the party.

1300
01:04:12,319 --> 01:04:14,855
Huh? Oh, yeah. yeah.

1301
01:04:14,922 --> 01:04:16,256
Will you excuse me
a minute?

1302
01:04:16,323 --> 01:04:17,591
It's kinda drafty
in here.

1303
01:04:17,658 --> 01:04:20,761
I'll go close
the window.

1304
01:04:20,828 --> 01:04:22,463
Sorry. I couldn't
find a flower.

1305
01:04:22,529 --> 01:04:23,597
Oh, that's all right.

1306
01:04:23,664 --> 01:04:24,932
It's kinda drafty
in here.

1307
01:04:24,999 --> 01:04:28,903
I'll go close
the window. Excuse me.

1308
01:04:28,970 --> 01:04:30,771
What took you
so long, dear?

1309
01:04:30,838 --> 01:04:34,174
I was stuck.
I mean the window was stuck.

1310
01:04:34,241 --> 01:04:35,375
Well,
should we order?

1311
01:04:35,442 --> 01:04:39,946
Yeah. Good idea.

1312
01:04:40,013 --> 01:04:41,482
Uh-oh.

1313
01:04:41,548 --> 01:04:45,118
Excuse me!

1314
01:04:45,185 --> 01:04:46,219
Tanya, what are you
doing?

1315
01:04:46,286 --> 01:04:48,089
Getting my wrap.
We must leave!

1316
01:04:48,156 --> 01:04:51,258
Look, t-the orchestra's
gettin' ready to play.

1317
01:04:51,325 --> 01:04:52,292
Let's dance.

1318
01:04:52,359 --> 01:04:56,029
Well...maybe just
once.

1319
01:04:56,096 --> 01:05:00,434
[Slow song starts]

1320
01:05:00,501 --> 01:05:01,702
I'd sure like
to dance.

1321
01:05:01,769 --> 01:05:04,070
I wonder where Fred is.

1322
01:05:04,137 --> 01:05:08,175
Uh-oh.

1323
01:05:08,241 --> 01:05:11,112
What are you doing,
Rock?

1324
01:05:11,179 --> 01:05:13,580
In this business,
you can't be too careful.

1325
01:05:13,647 --> 01:05:16,647
[Upbeat song starts]

1326
01:05:21,988 --> 01:05:25,059
It's Fred!

1327
01:05:25,126 --> 01:05:27,427
I didn't know you
wanted to dance, honey.

1328
01:05:27,494 --> 01:05:28,394
Wilma!

1329
01:05:38,872 --> 01:05:39,772
Uh-oh!

1330
01:05:44,678 --> 01:05:47,681
Oh, you dance divinely,
darling.

1331
01:05:47,748 --> 01:05:48,948
So do you, dear.

1332
01:05:49,015 --> 01:05:50,751
Dear?
Darling?

1333
01:05:50,818 --> 01:05:53,053
Come on, Tiger.
Let's get out of here.

1334
01:05:53,119 --> 01:05:54,221
Tiger?

1335
01:05:54,287 --> 01:05:55,789
So that's it!

1336
01:05:55,856 --> 01:05:58,158
That's your
unfinished business.

1337
01:05:58,225 --> 01:05:59,593
L-l-look, Wilma,

1338
01:05:59,660 --> 01:06:01,094
I--I can explain
everything.

1339
01:06:01,161 --> 01:06:02,296
I wish you would.

1340
01:06:02,363 --> 01:06:05,733
I've been going crazy down there
trying to record it.

1341
01:06:05,799 --> 01:06:07,467
There's nothing
to explain.

1342
01:06:07,534 --> 01:06:09,503
It's all
very obvious!

1343
01:06:09,570 --> 01:06:11,839
Wilma, please,
won't ya listen?

1344
01:06:11,906 --> 01:06:15,375
I'm going home...Tiger!

1345
01:06:15,442 --> 01:06:17,845
Hey, Flintstone.

1346
01:06:17,912 --> 01:06:19,279
Rock Slag's cab
is arriving.

1347
01:06:19,346 --> 01:06:20,547
Go get Tanya.

1348
01:06:20,614 --> 01:06:25,614
You can switch with Slag
in the lobby. Hurry!

1349
01:06:25,985 --> 01:06:27,354
Taxi!

1350
01:06:27,421 --> 01:06:28,956
Allow me, madame.

1351
01:06:29,023 --> 01:06:34,023
Don't you get smart
with me, Fred Flintstone!

1352
01:06:35,530 --> 01:06:40,530
So we see you in your
true colours, you playboy!

1353
01:06:44,439 --> 01:06:46,974
How could you do that
to the mother of your child?

1354
01:06:47,041 --> 01:06:51,011
Consider our friendship
ended!

1355
01:06:51,077 --> 01:06:52,877
You playboy!

1356
01:06:56,350 --> 01:06:59,353
Rock! Oh, no,
not again.

1357
01:06:59,419 --> 01:07:00,955
You powder your nose,
Tanya.

1358
01:07:01,022 --> 01:07:03,423
I'll wait for ya
in the lobby.

1359
01:07:03,490 --> 01:07:05,091
All set, Chief.
Where's Rock?

1360
01:07:05,158 --> 01:07:06,226
Right there.

1361
01:07:06,293 --> 01:07:07,427
What happened?

1362
01:07:07,494 --> 01:07:11,097
He must have had
a relapse.

1363
01:07:11,164 --> 01:07:12,432
Look!

1364
01:07:12,499 --> 01:07:14,535
Rock Slag!

1365
01:07:14,601 --> 01:07:17,238
Quick, upstairs!

1366
01:07:17,305 --> 01:07:19,974
Looks like you're going
to have to carry the ball

1367
01:07:20,041 --> 01:07:21,476
a little longer, Flintstone.

1368
01:07:21,543 --> 01:07:24,545
Me? I gotta go home and
square myself with Wilma!

1369
01:07:24,611 --> 01:07:25,980
No time for that now!

1370
01:07:26,047 --> 01:07:28,448
I just got this message.
Listen.

1371
01:07:28,515 --> 01:07:29,884
"Green Goose

01:07:35,323 --> 01:07:38,225

to stop the Green Goose!

Us? What do you mean
us?

You go with Tanya
to the Green Goose's hideout.

01:07:42,663 --> 01:07:43,831
I'll phone Triple X,

1378
01:07:43,898 --> 01:07:45,666
and we'll follow
right behind you.

1379
01:07:45,733 --> 01:07:46,867
Now just a minute.

I'm ready, Rock.

No time. First we must
take message to Green Goose.

01:08:16,531 --> 01:08:21,531

of us. Bwa ha ha ha!

OK, Rock.

01:08:46,192 --> 01:08:47,227
Now what?

1400
01:08:47,294 --> 01:08:49,830

wherever you are.

looking behind you?

to make sure

01:09:07,014 --> 01:09:08,249

followed.

is in there.

1408
01:09:22,497 --> 01:09:24,698
I'll go in first
and get behind him.

1409
01:09:24,765 --> 01:09:26,000
Then when you come in,

1410
01:09:26,066 --> 01:09:28,535
I will drop this rope
over him.

That won't be necessary.

wouldn't like it

1423

tried to leave.

01:10:04,838 --> 01:10:08,208
Hey, what is this?
What's goin' on, Tanya?

1427
01:10:08,275 --> 01:10:09,210
My dear Rock,

1428
01:10:09,277 --> 01:10:11,379
the Green Goose
needs some information.

1429
01:10:11,446 --> 01:10:14,281
So we set up
this little trap for you.

1430
01:10:14,347 --> 01:10:16,283
Surprised?

1431
01:10:16,349 --> 01:10:18,685
A double cross, huh?

1432
01:10:18,752 --> 01:10:21,521
Well, now I have
a surprise for you!

1433
01:10:21,588 --> 01:10:25,358
OK, Chief, come in!

1434
01:10:25,425 --> 01:10:26,627
Oh, uh,
there you are.

1435
01:10:26,693 --> 01:10:27,828
Barney!

1436
01:10:27,895 --> 01:10:29,430
Yeah, Barney.
I followed you here.

1437
01:10:29,497 --> 01:10:31,632
I'm not leaving until
I get some information!

1438
01:10:31,698 --> 01:10:34,701
Exactly what I was saying.

1439
01:10:34,768 --> 01:10:36,003
Hey, who are you,
buster?

1440
01:10:36,070 --> 01:10:37,537
And why are you
wearing this--

1441
01:10:37,604 --> 01:10:40,007
[Rrr]

1442
01:10:40,074 --> 01:10:41,942
Eh, ahem, look, Goose,

1443
01:10:42,009 --> 01:10:43,811
this guy is just
a friend of mine.

1444
01:10:43,877 --> 01:10:45,045
Why don't you
let him go?

1445
01:10:45,112 --> 01:10:47,081
Oh, come now, Mr Slag,

1446
01:10:47,148 --> 01:10:49,683
you know that's impossible!

1447
01:10:49,750 --> 01:10:50,784
Mr Slag?

1448
01:10:50,851 --> 01:10:51,819
Who's that?

1449
01:10:51,885 --> 01:10:53,386
That's me.
I'll explain later.

1450
01:10:53,453 --> 01:10:54,421
GOOSE: Slag?

1451
01:10:54,488 --> 01:10:55,490
I know your government

1452
01:10:55,556 --> 01:10:58,725
has been working on
an anti-missile missile.

1453
01:10:58,792 --> 01:11:01,329
I want to know
if they have completed it.

1454
01:11:01,395 --> 01:11:03,831
I don't know anything
about it.

1455
01:11:03,897 --> 01:11:06,066
GOOSE: I'd advise you
to cooperate.

1456
01:11:06,133 --> 01:11:07,835
I'd hate to resort
to using

1457
01:11:07,901 --> 01:11:10,470
unpleasant methods.

1458
01:11:10,537 --> 01:11:12,039
[Grrr]

1459
01:11:12,106 --> 01:11:13,807
Unpleasant methods?

1460
01:11:13,874 --> 01:11:14,975
What's going on?

1461
01:11:15,042 --> 01:11:16,678
This guy is
a master criminal

1462
01:11:16,744 --> 01:11:18,512
and I'm helping
the government capture him.

1463
01:11:18,578 --> 01:11:19,780
But don't worry.

1464
01:11:19,847 --> 01:11:21,782
Our agents will
bust in any minute.

1465
01:11:21,849 --> 01:11:24,584
You don't scare me,
Goose.

1466
01:11:24,651 --> 01:11:25,786
No?

1467
01:11:25,853 --> 01:11:28,355
What about your
chubby friend?

1468
01:11:28,421 --> 01:11:29,557
Uh-oh. I, uh...

1469
01:11:29,624 --> 01:11:32,492
I just rembered
I--I double parked outside.

1470
01:11:32,559 --> 01:11:33,660
I'll be right back.

1471
01:11:33,727 --> 01:11:34,695
Ferocious!

1472
01:11:34,761 --> 01:11:35,963
[Grrr]

1473
01:11:36,030 --> 01:11:38,732
[Grrr--grrr-grrr]

1474
01:11:38,799 --> 01:11:42,469
[Evil laughter]

1475
01:11:42,536 --> 01:11:44,170
Oh, oh, oh!

1476
01:11:44,237 --> 01:11:45,005
Oh!

1477
01:11:45,072 --> 01:11:46,807
GOOSE: Not yet, Ferocious.

1478
01:11:46,874 --> 01:11:49,342
I may need him.

1479
01:11:49,409 --> 01:11:50,177
Tanya!

1480
01:11:50,244 --> 01:11:53,313
Show them
the torture chamber!

1481
01:11:53,380 --> 01:11:54,430
[Creak]

1482
01:12:00,254 --> 01:12:03,090
These are some
of my toys,

1483
01:12:03,157 --> 01:12:05,292
but I want you to see
my latest one.

1484
01:12:05,359 --> 01:12:08,896
It's called
anerocktric chair.

1485
01:12:08,962 --> 01:12:10,764
We strap you in

1486
01:12:10,831 --> 01:12:13,867
and...

1487
01:12:13,934 --> 01:12:16,369
Quite effective,
isn't it?

1488
01:12:16,436 --> 01:12:18,272
Ab-bout my car.

1489
01:12:18,339 --> 01:12:20,440
I--I left my lights
on, too.

1490
01:12:20,507 --> 01:12:21,641
Can I turn 'em off?

1491
01:12:21,708 --> 01:12:22,943
Take it easy, Barn.

1492
01:12:23,010 --> 01:12:24,412
Help will be here
any second.

1493
01:12:24,478 --> 01:12:27,682
You'll get nothin'
out of me, Green Goose!

1494
01:12:27,749 --> 01:12:32,386
I knew it would be useless
to even try withyou, Slag,

1495
01:12:32,453 --> 01:12:34,922
but your chubby
little friend

1496
01:12:34,988 --> 01:12:38,324
is another story,
isn't he?

1497
01:12:38,391 --> 01:12:39,492
Heh heh heh.

1498
01:12:39,559 --> 01:12:42,863
Tanya, the rack!

1499
01:12:42,930 --> 01:12:44,398
FRED: Hey! Hey!

1500
01:12:44,465 --> 01:12:46,133
What are you doin'
to Barney?!

1501
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:49,002
Perhaps when you see what
happens to your friend

1502
01:12:49,069 --> 01:12:53,707
you'll tell me what
I want to know.

1503
01:12:53,774 --> 01:12:55,242
Yeow!

1504
01:12:55,309 --> 01:12:59,213
You can't intimidate me
with these crude methods.

1505
01:12:59,280 --> 01:13:01,314
I'm intimi-nated!

1506
01:13:01,381 --> 01:13:02,950
Yeow!

1507
01:13:03,016 --> 01:13:04,584
Talk, Slag.

1508
01:13:04,651 --> 01:13:05,619
Never!

1509
01:13:05,685 --> 01:13:07,186
BARNEY: Yeow!

1510
01:13:07,253 --> 01:13:08,221
Talk!

1511
01:13:08,288 --> 01:13:09,056
No!

1512
01:13:09,123 --> 01:13:10,891
BARNEY: Yeow!

1513
01:13:10,958 --> 01:13:13,527
Don't worry, Barn.

1514
01:13:13,594 --> 01:13:16,163
All we gotta do is
stall him a little longer.

1515
01:13:16,230 --> 01:13:19,033
My lips are sealed, Goose!

1516
01:13:19,099 --> 01:13:21,668
BARNEY: Yeow!

1517
01:13:21,735 --> 01:13:24,872
Slag, you're
superhuman.

1518
01:13:24,938 --> 01:13:27,441
I've never met
anyone like you.

1519
01:13:27,508 --> 01:13:32,046
Zounds! How much pain
can a man stand?

1520
01:13:32,112 --> 01:13:34,681
All you can dish out
and more.

1521
01:13:34,748 --> 01:13:36,417
BARNEY: Yeow!

1522
01:13:36,484 --> 01:13:39,019
Don't worry, Barney.
I can take it.

1523
01:13:39,086 --> 01:13:41,121
You ain't takin' it.
I am!

1524
01:13:41,188 --> 01:13:44,658
You're gonna come outta this
abig man!

1525
01:13:44,725 --> 01:13:46,793
And a thin one, too!

1526
01:13:46,860 --> 01:13:47,861
[Knock, knock]

1527
01:13:47,928 --> 01:13:51,131
At last!

1528
01:13:51,198 --> 01:13:52,166
It's about time.

1529
01:13:52,233 --> 01:13:53,200
I was beginnin'
to think

1530
01:13:53,267 --> 01:13:56,469
you wouldn't
show up.

1531
01:13:56,536 --> 01:13:58,072
Chief?

1532
01:13:58,138 --> 01:14:01,909
If you're expecting
Chief Boulder, he's out--

1533
01:14:01,975 --> 01:14:04,511
out cold for the evening.

1534
01:14:04,578 --> 01:14:05,379
That's right.

1535
01:14:05,446 --> 01:14:07,881
And we found
this message on him.

1536
01:14:07,948 --> 01:14:08,916
Hmm...

1537
01:14:08,982 --> 01:14:10,384
"Green Goose
secret weapon

1538
01:14:10,451 --> 01:14:13,287
"is giant
inter-rockinental missile.

1539
01:14:13,354 --> 01:14:16,957
our anti-missile missile
is not operational yet."

1540
01:14:17,024 --> 01:14:18,592
Ha ha ha ha!

1541
01:14:18,658 --> 01:14:20,094
Good work, Ali.

1542
01:14:20,160 --> 01:14:22,096
Release the prisoner, Tanya.

1543
01:14:22,162 --> 01:14:26,662
I have the information
I need.

1544
01:14:27,234 --> 01:14:30,804
Lock those two up
and prepare to launch missile.

1545
01:14:30,871 --> 01:14:33,807
Nobody can stop me now!

1546
01:14:33,874 --> 01:14:38,524
Mwa ha ha ha ha
ha ha ha ha ha!

1547
01:14:40,381 --> 01:14:42,483
So that's the way
it was, Barney.

1548
01:14:42,550 --> 01:14:45,052
Just because I happen
to look like Rock Slag,

1549
01:14:45,119 --> 01:14:47,655
I got the plane tickets,
money, everything,

1550
01:14:47,722 --> 01:14:50,557
and I also got you
into this mess--

1551
01:14:50,624 --> 01:14:51,792
my best friend.

1552
01:14:51,858 --> 01:14:53,594
Well, uh,
could be worse, Fred.

1553
01:14:53,661 --> 01:14:56,263
At least Betty and Wilma
and the kids are OK.

1554
01:14:56,330 --> 01:14:59,733
Yeah. I wonder if we'll
ever see 'em again.

1555
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:01,501
Hey, Slag!

1556
01:15:01,568 --> 01:15:03,170
Chowtime!

1557
01:15:03,237 --> 01:15:04,972
Hee hee! Hee hee!
Hee hee hee hee!

1558
01:15:05,038 --> 01:15:06,073
Oh, boy, food.

1559
01:15:06,140 --> 01:15:08,441
Oh, I'm starved.

1560
01:15:08,508 --> 01:15:09,376
[Slurp]

1561
01:15:09,443 --> 01:15:12,480
Fred: Barney!
Don't eat that stuff!

1562
01:15:12,546 --> 01:15:15,448
I couldn't
if I wanted to, Fred.

1563
01:15:15,515 --> 01:15:16,783
No spoon.

1564
01:15:16,850 --> 01:15:18,051
Looks like
the Green Goose

1565
01:15:18,118 --> 01:15:19,620
is tryin' to get rid
of us, Barney.

1566
01:15:19,687 --> 01:15:22,423
We've gotta get outta
here and find that missile.

1567
01:15:22,490 --> 01:15:27,328
Oh, I wonder
where it could be.

1568
01:15:27,394 --> 01:15:29,229
Enh heh heh
heh heh heh heh!

1569
01:15:29,296 --> 01:15:31,465
The Fun House.

1570
01:15:31,532 --> 01:15:35,602
I hope our guests are
enjoying their last moments.

1571
01:15:35,669 --> 01:15:36,803
This amusement park

1572
01:15:36,870 --> 01:15:38,939
is the perfect
launching spot.

1573
01:15:39,006 --> 01:15:41,375
Who would think
that the space ride

1574
01:15:41,442 --> 01:15:44,377
isreallya deadly missile?

1575
01:15:44,444 --> 01:15:45,412
No one.

1576
01:15:45,479 --> 01:15:49,716
Now, let's prepare
to launch.

1577
01:15:49,783 --> 01:15:50,685
Hey--hey, Fred,

1578
01:15:50,751 --> 01:15:52,353
you sure you know
what you're doin'?

1579
01:15:52,419 --> 01:15:54,221
This tower
is 100-feet high,

1580
01:15:54,288 --> 01:15:56,223
and you've got
an awful short tie.

1581
01:15:56,290 --> 01:15:58,359
Don't worry.
We'll make it.

1582
01:15:58,425 --> 01:16:00,194
Oh, e-easy, Fred.

1583
01:16:00,260 --> 01:16:01,729
Howya doin', Barn?

1584
01:16:01,796 --> 01:16:04,264
You think you can jump
the rest of the way?

1585
01:16:04,331 --> 01:16:06,133
Are you kiddin'?
Pull me up!

1586
01:16:06,200 --> 01:16:08,902
Pull me up!

1587
01:16:08,969 --> 01:16:11,471
Uh-oh!

1588
01:16:11,538 --> 01:16:15,976
He-elp!

1589
01:16:16,043 --> 01:16:17,010
Faster, Barney!

1590
01:16:17,077 --> 01:16:20,780
Faster!

1591
01:16:20,847 --> 01:16:23,917
Hurry, Barney!
Hurry!

1592
01:16:23,984 --> 01:16:25,653
Oh, nice goin', Fred.

1593
01:16:25,720 --> 01:16:27,354
You nearly
got me killed.

1594
01:16:27,421 --> 01:16:28,622
What are you
complain' about?

1595
01:16:28,689 --> 01:16:30,790
That was my best tie
you ruined.

1596
01:16:30,857 --> 01:16:31,992
Oh, sorry, Fred.

1597
01:16:32,059 --> 01:16:35,062
Guess we never
will get outta here.

1598
01:16:35,128 --> 01:16:36,263
Hey, Barney, look.

1599
01:16:36,330 --> 01:16:37,497
What is it?

1600
01:16:37,564 --> 01:16:38,833
The guards--

1601
01:16:38,900 --> 01:16:40,468
They're asleep, and the key
is hangin' on the desk.

1602
01:16:40,534 --> 01:16:41,735
So what good
does that--

1603
01:16:41,802 --> 01:16:43,304
Shh! Quiet.

1604
01:16:43,370 --> 01:16:45,038
Oh, uh, sorry, Fred,

1605
01:16:45,105 --> 01:16:47,207
but, uh, how are we
gonna get the key?

1606
01:16:47,274 --> 01:16:49,143
[WHISPERING] That's what
we gotta figure out.

1607
01:16:49,209 --> 01:16:51,612
Hey, would you mind
speakin' a little louder?

1608
01:16:51,679 --> 01:16:53,347
I can't hear a word
you're saying.

1609
01:16:53,414 --> 01:16:55,282
Well, whaddya know?

1610
01:16:55,349 --> 01:16:57,518
The tape recorder.

1611
01:16:57,585 --> 01:17:00,154
How would you like to
do us a little favour?

1612
01:17:00,220 --> 01:17:01,555
What kind of
a little favour?

1613
01:17:01,622 --> 01:17:04,691
Oh, nothin' much.
You see that key?

1614
01:17:04,758 --> 01:17:05,792
What about it?

1615
01:17:05,859 --> 01:17:07,127
Just fly over there

1616
01:17:07,194 --> 01:17:08,595
and bring it back
to me.

1617
01:17:08,662 --> 01:17:09,463
Unh-uh.

1618
01:17:09,530 --> 01:17:11,198
I'm a recorder,
not a retriever.

1619
01:17:11,265 --> 01:17:12,667
But you've got to.

1620
01:17:12,733 --> 01:17:14,735
It's our only chance
to get outta here.

1621
01:17:14,802 --> 01:17:16,903
All right, All right,
simmer down.

1622
01:17:16,970 --> 01:17:19,820
I'll give it a try.

1623
01:17:22,409 --> 01:17:26,079
Shh! Turn around.

1624
01:17:26,146 --> 01:17:29,850
Whoops!

1625
01:17:29,916 --> 01:17:31,685
Oh, no!

1626
01:17:31,751 --> 01:17:32,953
Sorry, it slipped.

1627
01:17:33,020 --> 01:17:34,321
But don't worry.
I'll get it.

1628
01:17:34,388 --> 01:17:39,360
Just put me down and relax.

1629
01:17:39,426 --> 01:17:40,760
What's he gonna do,
Fred?

1630
01:17:40,827 --> 01:17:41,928
Beats me.

1631
01:17:41,995 --> 01:17:43,497
RECORDER:
Whoa! I'm hurt!

1632
01:17:43,564 --> 01:17:45,366
The old wing is shot.

1633
01:17:45,432 --> 01:17:46,900
Woe is me!

1634
01:17:46,967 --> 01:17:48,870
I can't fly anymore.

1635
01:17:48,936 --> 01:17:52,473
Never again to zoom
into the wild blue.

1636
01:17:52,540 --> 01:17:54,041
Isn't that
an awful thing

1637
01:17:54,107 --> 01:17:56,009
to happen
to poor little me?

1638
01:17:56,076 --> 01:17:58,546
[Grrr]

1639
01:17:58,612 --> 01:18:00,814
Get ready!
Here comes the pigeon!

1640
01:18:00,881 --> 01:18:02,182
[Grr]

1641
01:18:02,249 --> 01:18:04,651
Come on, bird!
Come on!

1642
01:18:04,718 --> 01:18:05,918
Open up!

1643
01:18:11,959 --> 01:18:15,563
Barney, I got it!
I got the key!

1644
01:18:15,629 --> 01:18:20,629
I just hope the union
never hears about this.

1645
01:18:24,238 --> 01:18:26,488
[Muffled yells]

1646
01:18:30,944 --> 01:18:31,712
Hold it, Barney.

1647
01:18:31,779 --> 01:18:33,447
That door might lead
to a trap.

1648
01:18:33,514 --> 01:18:34,915
You better
let me check first.

1649
01:18:34,981 --> 01:18:36,331
OK, Fred.

1650
01:18:45,259 --> 01:18:48,195
It's OK, Barn. Come on.

1651
01:18:48,262 --> 01:18:52,132
Barney, where are you?

1652
01:18:52,199 --> 01:18:54,501
Let me go! Let me go!

1653
01:18:54,568 --> 01:18:56,270
Take it easy, Rock.

1654
01:18:56,336 --> 01:18:58,505
It's only me,
Triple X.

1655
01:18:58,572 --> 01:19:02,209
Oh, boy, am I glad
to see you.

1656
01:19:02,276 --> 01:19:03,944
Where ya been?
What took you so long?

1657
01:19:04,010 --> 01:19:05,045
Where's the Chief?

1658
01:19:05,112 --> 01:19:07,914
One question
at a time, please.

1659
01:19:07,981 --> 01:19:08,749
Sorry.

1660
01:19:08,816 --> 01:19:10,384
Here. You dropped
your hat...

1661
01:19:10,451 --> 01:19:13,053
and your hanky.

1662
01:19:13,120 --> 01:19:15,723
Hey, that's funny,
Triple X.

1663
01:19:15,790 --> 01:19:18,392
The Green Goose was
wearin' a mask like this.

1664
01:19:18,459 --> 01:19:22,463
He was? What
a very clever disguise,

1665
01:19:22,529 --> 01:19:24,298
don't you think?

1666
01:19:24,364 --> 01:19:27,134
Now, may I have it back,
please?

1667
01:19:27,200 --> 01:19:30,137
You mean...
this is your mask?

1668
01:19:30,203 --> 01:19:33,440
Heh heh heh heh...
heh heh heh heh!

1669
01:19:33,507 --> 01:19:36,243
Yes, exactly.

1670
01:19:36,310 --> 01:19:38,512
Boo-hoo hoo hoo hoo!

1671
01:19:38,579 --> 01:19:41,281
Then you're--
you're the Green Goose.

1672
01:19:41,348 --> 01:19:43,883
And you're a dead duck.

1673
01:19:43,950 --> 01:19:46,253
Ali, Bobo, over here!

1674
01:19:46,320 --> 01:19:49,256
Oh, no, you don't!

1675
01:19:49,323 --> 01:19:51,573
Come back, you!

1676
01:21:28,188 --> 01:21:29,523
Never mind!

1677
01:21:29,590 --> 01:21:31,492
I'm going to
fire the missile.

1678
01:21:31,558 --> 01:21:32,960
Come on.

1679
01:21:33,027 --> 01:21:34,861
Hee hee! Hee hee hee!
Hee hee! Hee hee!

1680
01:21:34,928 --> 01:21:36,129
Ha ha ha!

1681
01:21:36,196 --> 01:21:38,599
BO: Oh, boy!
Big fireworks.

1682
01:21:38,666 --> 01:21:40,467
ALI: Whole world
go boom!

1683
01:21:40,534 --> 01:21:43,170
Hee hee! Hee hee hee!
Hee hee! Hee hee!

1684
01:21:43,236 --> 01:21:46,774
The missile.
I gotta stop 'em!

1685
01:21:46,841 --> 01:21:48,241
I wonder where Barney is.

1686
01:21:48,308 --> 01:21:50,110
Maybe he could--

1687
01:21:50,177 --> 01:21:53,780
He-elp!

1688
01:21:53,847 --> 01:21:55,716
[Grr]

1689
01:21:55,783 --> 01:21:57,651
Take it easy,
Ferocious.

1690
01:21:57,718 --> 01:21:59,853
Can't we sorta
talk this over?

1691
01:21:59,919 --> 01:22:02,656
[Grr--]

1692
01:22:02,723 --> 01:22:05,392
Fred, oh, boy,
am I glad to see you.

1693
01:22:05,459 --> 01:22:07,594
Ferocious wasn't gonna
wait till lunchtime.

1694
01:22:07,661 --> 01:22:09,530
Come on, Barney.

1695
01:22:09,596 --> 01:22:13,734
There's no time to lose.

1696
01:22:13,801 --> 01:22:16,737
[Green Goose cackles]

1697
01:22:16,804 --> 01:22:19,673
This is the big moment,
gentlemen.

1698
01:22:19,740 --> 01:22:24,740
First, I set
the directional control.

1699
01:22:26,780 --> 01:22:31,585
Then I set
the firing pin.

1700
01:22:31,652 --> 01:22:33,821
When the countdown
reaches zero,

1701
01:22:33,888 --> 01:22:37,290
The blade will snap back,
cut the rope,

1702
01:22:37,357 --> 01:22:39,760
and the missile
will take off.

1703
01:22:39,827 --> 01:22:42,563
Oh, Goose,
you are a genius.

1704
01:22:42,629 --> 01:22:44,631
Oh, you are so right.

1705
01:22:44,698 --> 01:22:45,799
In a matter of minutes,

1706
01:22:45,866 --> 01:22:48,335
the whole world
will know of my power,

1707
01:22:48,402 --> 01:22:53,052
and I alone shall rule
supreme.

1708
01:22:56,543 --> 01:22:57,711
[Buzz]

1709
01:22:57,778 --> 01:23:01,682
Ah ha ha ha ha ha!

1710
01:23:01,749 --> 01:23:03,684
We've got to find
that missile, Barney.

1711
01:23:03,751 --> 01:23:05,652
It's all up to us now.

1712
01:23:05,719 --> 01:23:07,654
Hey, Fred, look--
The Green Goose.

1713
01:23:07,721 --> 01:23:12,025
Hold on, Barney!
We're crashin' through.

1714
01:23:12,092 --> 01:23:14,060
Stop them, Bobo!

1715
01:23:14,127 --> 01:23:18,565
Right.

1716
01:23:18,632 --> 01:23:22,903
Ahh...Mr Slag,
We meet again.

1717
01:23:22,970 --> 01:23:26,039
But too late
for you to stop me!

1718
01:23:26,106 --> 01:23:28,876
Run, Barney! Run!

1719
01:23:28,943 --> 01:23:30,577
Head for the space ride,
Barney.

1720
01:23:30,644 --> 01:23:33,794
We can hide in there.

1721
01:23:36,283 --> 01:23:37,785
Oh! It's locked.

1722
01:23:37,852 --> 01:23:39,453
Uh, press
the button.

1723
01:23:39,520 --> 01:23:40,654
[Buzz]

1724
01:23:40,721 --> 01:23:45,359
Inside, quick.

1725
01:23:45,425 --> 01:23:48,629
Green Goose: Don't
open that door!

1726
01:23:48,696 --> 01:23:50,698
Our friends have
trapped themselves

1727
01:23:50,764 --> 01:23:52,033
in the missile.

1728
01:23:52,099 --> 01:23:55,435
Well, we no longer
need concern ourselves

1729
01:23:55,502 --> 01:23:56,470
with them.

1730
01:23:56,537 --> 01:23:57,771
Hey, didya hear that,
Fred?

1731
01:23:57,838 --> 01:24:00,541
Yeah, Barney.
We found the missile.

1732
01:24:00,607 --> 01:24:02,643
Well--well,
what can we do?

1733
01:24:02,710 --> 01:24:04,678
Nothin' to save ourselves,

1734
01:24:04,745 --> 01:24:06,446
but we can aim the missile
into space,

1735
01:24:06,513 --> 01:24:08,281
where it won't do any harm.

1736
01:24:08,348 --> 01:24:11,084
At least that's somethin'.

1737
01:24:11,151 --> 01:24:12,920
Oh, boy. Payload

1738
01:24:12,987 --> 01:24:15,556
in an interplanetary
projectile.

1739
01:24:15,622 --> 01:24:17,558
Oh! What a way
to go!

1740
01:24:17,624 --> 01:24:20,661
They say we all gotta go
sometime, Barn.

1741
01:24:20,728 --> 01:24:22,629
Too bad I'll
never get the chance

1742
01:24:22,696 --> 01:24:24,665
to give Wilma
this present.

1743
01:24:24,732 --> 01:24:27,034
Wow, Fred,
where'd you get that?

1744
01:24:27,101 --> 01:24:29,369
BARNEY: It must
be worth millions!

1745
01:24:29,436 --> 01:24:31,505
Huh?

1746
01:24:31,572 --> 01:24:34,341
Nah. No, it's
only worth, uh...

1747
01:24:34,408 --> 01:24:35,843
uh...

1748
01:24:35,910 --> 01:24:38,645
It's only worthone million.

1749
01:24:38,712 --> 01:24:39,914
Just think, Barney--

1750
01:24:39,980 --> 01:24:43,283
we'll be the richest guys
in space.

1751
01:24:43,350 --> 01:24:45,185
A million!

1752
01:24:45,252 --> 01:24:47,487
Slag! Heh heh heh!

1753
01:24:47,554 --> 01:24:49,590
I'll make a deal
with you.

1754
01:24:49,656 --> 01:24:51,258
I'll swap you
your lives

1755
01:24:51,324 --> 01:24:53,427
for that
necklace.

1756
01:24:53,493 --> 01:24:55,095
On your toes, Barn.

1757
01:24:55,161 --> 01:24:56,363
It's a deal.

1758
01:24:56,430 --> 01:24:57,698
[Buzz]

1759
01:24:57,765 --> 01:24:59,800
Hand it out.

1760
01:24:59,867 --> 01:25:01,602
Here you are!

1764
01:25:12,679 --> 01:25:14,081
Let--let me out!

1765
01:25:14,148 --> 01:25:17,898
No, no! Let me out!
Help!

1766
01:25:21,655 --> 01:25:23,124
Well, that's
what always happens

1767
01:25:23,190 --> 01:25:25,358
to guys who want
to take over the world.

1768
01:25:25,425 --> 01:25:27,027
Yeah. Heh heh heh!

1769
01:25:27,094 --> 01:25:30,394
They end up
out of it.

1770
01:25:47,347 --> 01:25:49,950
And with great pride,

1771
01:25:50,017 --> 01:25:52,452
we, the citizens
of Bedrock,

01:25:52,519 --> 01:25:55,288

ANNOUNCER: After a week

1776
01:26:00,060 --> 01:26:02,096

has slipped away
for a well-earned rest.

Only clue
as to his whereabouts

1780
01:26:08,669 --> 01:26:12,873
is a note saying
"Gone fishing."

1781
01:26:12,940 --> 01:26:16,177
Oh, it feels
so good to relax.

1782
01:26:16,243 --> 01:26:19,646
Yeah. It's been
one parade after another.

1783
01:26:19,713 --> 01:26:22,349
My Fred, a big hero.

1784
01:26:22,415 --> 01:26:24,384
Oh, I'm so proud of you.

1785
01:26:24,451 --> 01:26:25,652
Oh...hee hee!

1786
01:26:25,719 --> 01:26:27,355
Forget the hero stuff.

1787
01:26:27,421 --> 01:26:29,623
Forget everything
that happened in Eurock.

1788
01:26:29,690 --> 01:26:32,726
From now on, I am
just Fred Flintstone,

1789
01:26:32,793 --> 01:26:34,228
average citizen.

1790
01:26:34,295 --> 01:26:37,330
Besides, Barney deserves
as much credit as I do.

1791
01:26:37,397 --> 01:26:38,232
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1792
01:26:38,299 --> 01:26:41,602
I deserve as much
credit as Fred.

1793
01:26:41,668 --> 01:26:42,903
Well, now, wait
a minute, Barn.

1794
01:26:42,970 --> 01:26:44,471
I was the one that--
Ha ha!

1795
01:26:44,538 --> 01:26:46,339
[Girls laugh]

1796
01:26:46,406 --> 01:26:48,075
Aw...ha ha ha!

1797
01:26:48,142 --> 01:26:50,644
Now, cut it out,
cut it out.

1798
01:26:50,711 --> 01:26:51,812
Hey, come on, Fred.

1799
01:26:51,879 --> 01:26:53,380
Last one
down to the lake

1800
01:26:53,447 --> 01:26:55,116
is a pickled
pterodactyl!

1801
01:26:55,182 --> 01:26:58,351
Hey...
yabba dabba do!

1802
01:26:58,418 --> 01:27:00,420
Here I am, pal!

1803
01:27:00,487 --> 01:27:02,456
Rockello!

1804
01:27:02,522 --> 01:27:04,558
Hey...eh,paesano!

1805
01:27:04,625 --> 01:27:07,060
Roberta! Mario!

1806
01:27:07,127 --> 01:27:07,895
Gangway!

1807
01:27:07,962 --> 01:27:11,899
After him, quick!

1808
01:27:11,966 --> 01:27:13,433
Wilma, help!

1809
01:27:13,500 --> 01:27:14,902
Rockello!

1810
01:27:14,969 --> 01:27:17,838
Hey,paesano,wait!

1811
01:27:17,905 --> 01:27:21,875
"Rockello? Paesano"?
What's going on?

1812
01:27:21,942 --> 01:27:22,910
I don't know,

1813
01:27:22,977 --> 01:27:24,678
but I have a feeling
that Fred

1814
01:27:24,745 --> 01:27:27,147
isn't going to forget
his trip to Eurock

1815
01:27:27,213 --> 01:27:28,348
in a hurry.

1816
01:27:28,415 --> 01:27:30,050
Help! Help!

1817
01:27:30,117 --> 01:27:32,419
Somebody,
do something!

1818
01:27:32,486 --> 01:27:34,388
Rockello,

1819
01:27:34,455 --> 01:27:36,623
Hey, come back here,peasan!

1820
01:27:36,690 --> 01:27:37,925
Help! Help!

1821
01:27:37,992 --> 01:27:40,461
Oh, we're gonna
get-a married!

1822
01:27:40,528 --> 01:27:43,430
MARIO: And-a go on
a nice-a honeymoon.

1823
01:27:43,497 --> 01:27:45,365
