00:13:55,345 --> 00:13:57,177
I'll show you later.

169
00:13:57,681 --> 00:14:01,265
What about studs and links?
Do I choose them or does he?

170
00:14:01,351 --> 00:14:04,140
Lay them out unless he asks
for something in particular.

171
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:08,349
These for a ball, these for an
ordinary dinner, these only in London.

172
00:14:08,442 --> 00:14:11,776
-I'll get the hang of it.
-Yeah, you'll have to.

173
00:14:16,284 --> 00:14:18,696
Snuff boxes, he collects them.

174
00:14:19,537 --> 00:14:21,244
BATES: Beautiful.

175
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:25,782
-Funny our job, isn't it?
-What do you mean?

176
00:14:27,211 --> 00:14:31,581
The way we live with all this
pirate's hoard within our reach.

177
00:14:31,883 --> 00:14:34,215
But none of it's ours, is it?

178
00:14:35,595 --> 00:14:37,632
No, none of it's ours.

179
00:14:48,775 --> 00:14:51,527
I can't believe I've been passed over
for Long John Silver.

180
00:14:51,611 --> 00:14:53,821
You should have spoken up
when you had the chance.

181
00:14:53,905 --> 00:14:55,657
Don't make the same mistake next time.

182
00:14:55,741 --> 00:14:58,403
Who says there'll be a next time?

183
00:14:58,493 --> 00:15:01,737
Is this a public holiday
no one's told me of?

184
00:15:07,503 --> 00:15:09,961
She was certainly reluctant
to go into mourning.

185
00:15:10,089 --> 00:15:12,547
Well, she'll have to. We all will.

186
00:15:12,633 --> 00:15:14,465
O'Brien's sorting out my black now.

187
00:15:14,594 --> 00:15:18,588
And I've told Anna to see
what the girls have that still fits.

188
00:15:19,098 --> 00:15:22,341
Of course, this alters everything.

189
00:15:24,479 --> 00:15:26,470
You won't try to deny it.

190
00:15:26,606 --> 00:15:29,599
You must challenge the entail now, surely.

191
00:15:29,777 --> 00:15:33,196
Can't we at least wait until
we know they're dead before we discuss it?

192
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:36,773
Don't talk as if I'm not brokenhearted,
because I am.

193
00:15:38,369 --> 00:15:41,327
Of course, I've never understood why
this estate must go

194
00:15:41,455 --> 00:15:43,039
to whomever inherits your title.

195
00:15:43,123 --> 00:15:46,491
My dear, I don't make the law. What is it?

196
00:15:46,627 --> 00:15:49,289
CARSON: The Dowager Countess is
in the drawing room.

197
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:52,498
-I'll come now.
-She asked for Lady Grantham.

198
00:15:53,175 --> 00:15:55,257
I wonder what I've done wrong this time.

199
00:15:55,344 --> 00:15:58,337
Oh. And the new valet
has arrived, my lord.

200
00:15:58,473 --> 00:16:00,635
Has he? Thank you, Carson.

201
00:16:00,725 --> 00:16:02,386
[CLEARS THROAT]

202
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:03,850
What is it?

203
00:16:03,978 --> 00:16:07,767
I'm not entirely sure
that he'll prove equal to the task.

204
00:16:07,857 --> 00:16:11,145
But your lordship will
be the judge of that.

205
00:16:15,407 --> 00:16:16,863
Better go.

206
00:16:19,077 --> 00:16:22,695
Tell her about James and Patrick.
She won't have heard.

207
00:16:23,331 --> 00:16:26,165
Of course I've heard.
Why else would I be here?

208
00:16:26,252 --> 00:16:29,836
Robert didn't want you to read about it
in the newspaper and be upset.

209
00:16:29,922 --> 00:16:31,663
He flatters me.

210
00:16:31,841 --> 00:16:33,923
I'm tougher than I look.

211
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:37,593
I'm very sorry about
poor Patrick, of course.

212
00:16:37,847 --> 00:16:40,760
-He was a nice boy.
-We were all so fond of him.

213
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:43,182
But I never cared for James.

214
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:48,013
He was too like his mother
and a nastier woman never drew breath.

215
00:16:50,359 --> 00:16:52,726
-Will you stay for some luncheon?
-Thank you.

216
00:16:52,863 --> 00:16:54,822
-I'll let Carson know.
-I've already told him.

217
00:16:54,906 --> 00:16:56,692
Shall we sit down?

218
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:05,573
-Do you know the new heir?
-Only that there is one.

219
00:17:06,251 --> 00:17:09,289
He's Robert's third cousin, once removed.

220
00:17:09,379 --> 00:17:11,871
I have never to my knowledge
set eyes on him.

221
00:17:11,965 --> 00:17:16,630
Of course, if your late husband hadn't forced
me to sign that absurd act of legal theft...

222
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,553
My dear, I didn't come here to fight.

223
00:17:19,931 --> 00:17:22,720
Lord Grantham wanted
to protect the estate.

224
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:25,552
It never occurred to him
that you wouldn't have a son.

225
00:17:25,646 --> 00:17:29,480
-Well, I didn't.
-No, you did not.

226
00:17:30,318 --> 00:17:32,605
But when Patrick had married Mary

227
00:17:32,737 --> 00:17:37,402
and your grandson been hailed as master,
honor would have been satisfied.

228
00:17:38,075 --> 00:17:40,407
[SIGHS] Unfortunately, now...

229
00:17:40,495 --> 00:17:43,163
Now, a complete unknown has the right
to pocket my money

230
00:17:43,247 --> 00:17:45,830
along with the rest of the swag.

231
00:17:46,167 --> 00:17:50,878
The problem is, saving your dowry
would break up the estate.

232
00:17:51,798 --> 00:17:54,801
It would be the ruin of everything
Robert's given his life to.

233
00:17:54,885 --> 00:17:59,129
-And he knows this?
-Well, if he doesn't, he will.

234
00:17:59,223 --> 00:18:04,059
-Then there's no answer.
-Yes, there is, and it's a simple one.

235
00:18:05,312 --> 00:18:10,057
The entail must be smashed in its entirety

236
00:18:10,859 --> 00:18:13,647
and Mary recognized as heiress of all.

237
00:18:14,821 --> 00:18:18,064
-There's nothing we can do about the title.
-No.

238
00:18:18,158 --> 00:18:22,153
She can't have the title,
but she can have your money.

239
00:18:23,122 --> 00:18:24,704
And the estate.

240
00:18:25,959 --> 00:18:28,576
I didn't run Downton for 30 years

241
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:34,540
to see it go lock, stock and barrel
to a stranger from God knows where.

242
00:18:34,884 --> 00:18:36,215
[SIGHS]

243
00:18:36,594 --> 00:18:38,835
Are we to be friends, then?

244
00:18:43,226 --> 00:18:48,267
We are allies, my dear,
which can be a good deal more effective.

245
00:18:52,152 --> 00:18:56,771
Downton is a great house, Mr. Bates.
And the Crawleys are a great family.

246
00:18:57,116 --> 00:19:01,906
We live by certain standards and those
standards can at first seem daunting.

247
00:19:01,996 --> 00:19:03,157
Of course.

248
00:19:03,247 --> 00:19:06,660
If you find yourself tongue-tied
in the presence of his lordship,

249
00:19:07,042 --> 00:19:10,160
I can only assure you
that his manners and grace

250
00:19:10,254 --> 00:19:13,792
will soon help you to perform your duties
to the best of your ability.

251
00:19:13,882 --> 00:19:14,917
I know.

252
00:19:15,009 --> 00:19:17,798
Bates, my dear fellow.

253
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:20,681
I do apologize, I should have realized
you'd all be at luncheon.

254
00:19:20,765 --> 00:19:23,302
-Not at all, my lord.
-Please, sit. Sit, everyone.

255
00:19:23,393 --> 00:19:26,931
I just want to say a quick hello
to my old comrade in arms.

256
00:19:27,022 --> 00:19:29,889
Bates, my dear man, welcome to Downton.

257
00:19:30,233 --> 00:19:31,974
Thank you, sir.

258
00:19:33,695 --> 00:19:37,484
I'm so sorry to have disturbed you all.
Please forgive me.

259
00:19:46,042 --> 00:19:47,703
You never asked.

260
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,877
Thomas, take that up.

261
00:19:55,426 --> 00:19:57,838
Leave it, Daisy! He's a grown man.

262
00:19:57,928 --> 00:20:00,044
I suppose he can lift a meat pie.

263
00:20:00,139 --> 00:20:03,257
Now, put that apple
tart in the lower oven.

264
00:20:04,518 --> 00:20:08,307
Oh, and take that away.
Mr. Lynch shouldn't have left it there.

265
00:20:08,397 --> 00:20:10,183
-What is it?
-Salt of Sorrel.

266
00:20:10,274 --> 00:20:13,233
I asked him for some
to clean the brass pots.

267
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:16,438
So, put it somewhere careful. It's poison.

268
00:20:16,907 --> 00:20:21,071
Seems like a lot of food
when you think they're all in mourning.

269
00:20:21,662 --> 00:20:25,872
Nothing makes you hungrier or more tired
than grief.

270
00:20:26,124 --> 00:20:28,616
When my sister died, God rest her soul,

271
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:31,919
I ate my way through four platefuls
of sandwiches at one sitting

272
00:20:32,005 --> 00:20:34,042
and slept round the clock.

273
00:20:34,132 --> 00:20:36,419
Did it make you feel better?

274
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:38,877
Not much, but it passed the time.

275
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:42,680
Oh, my Lord! What was this chopped egg
supposed to be sprinkled on?

276
00:20:42,767 --> 00:20:46,305
-Was it the chicken?
-It was. Take it upstairs now.

277
00:20:46,521 --> 00:20:49,229
-I can't go in the dining room.
-I should think not.

278
00:20:49,315 --> 00:20:51,807
Find Thomas or William
and tell them what to do.

279
00:20:52,318 --> 00:20:56,068
And for heaven's sake get a move on, girl,
before they get back from church.

280
00:20:56,906 --> 00:21:01,571
Well, we've given them a memorial
in London and a memorial here.

281
00:21:01,661 --> 00:21:05,780
MURRAY: I prefer memorials to funerals,
they're less dispiriting.

282
00:21:05,873 --> 00:21:08,956
We could hardly have held a funeral
without the bodies.

283
00:21:09,043 --> 00:21:13,254
I gather they're putting up a stone to
mark those whose bodies were never found.

284
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:17,379
In fact, I hear the Canadians are making
quite a thing at the <i>Titanic</i> cemetery.

285
00:21:17,469 --> 00:21:19,426
I'm surprised at the number they found.

286
00:21:19,513 --> 00:21:22,881
You'd think the sea
would've taken more of them.

287
00:21:25,018 --> 00:21:28,556
So, Murray, what have you to tell me
about the lucky Mr. Crawley?

288
00:21:28,647 --> 00:21:30,308
Nothing too terrible, I hope.

289
00:21:30,399 --> 00:21:35,109
[CHUCKLES] I've only made a few inquiries
but, no, there's not much to alarm you.

290
00:21:35,195 --> 00:21:38,188
Matthew Crawley is a solicitor
based in Manchester.

291
00:21:38,283 --> 00:21:39,739
Manchester?

292
00:21:40,326 --> 00:21:42,863
His special field is company law.

293
00:21:44,122 --> 00:21:46,329
His mother is alive and he lives with her.

294
00:21:46,416 --> 00:21:49,329
His father obviously
is not. He was a doctor.

295
00:21:49,419 --> 00:21:50,705
I know.

296
00:21:51,212 --> 00:21:54,455
It does seem odd that
my third cousin should be a doctor.

297
00:21:54,549 --> 00:21:56,961
There are worse professions.

298
00:21:57,844 --> 00:21:59,130
Indeed.

299
00:22:07,354 --> 00:22:09,856
Do me a favor. This is supposed to be
sprinkled on the chicken.

300
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:12,734
-But isn't there more to go up?
-Oh, please, it won't take a moment.

301
00:22:12,818 --> 00:22:14,418
-Go on then, give it here.
-Okay.

302
00:22:15,154 --> 00:22:18,613
MURRAY: We ought to talk about
the business of the entail.

303
00:22:18,699 --> 00:22:23,159
As you know, on your death,
the heir to the title inherits everything,

304
00:22:23,245 --> 00:22:26,954
except for the sums set aside
for your daughters and your widow.

305
00:22:27,041 --> 00:22:28,156
Yes.

306
00:22:28,459 --> 00:22:30,325
Owing to the terms of her settlement,

307
00:22:30,419 --> 00:22:33,832
this will include the bulk
of your wife's fortune.

308
00:22:33,923 --> 00:22:36,541
[SIGHS] It has been our sole topic
of conversation

309
00:22:36,635 --> 00:22:38,285
since the day the ship went down.

310
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:41,633
MURRAY: Of course it must seem
horribly unjust to Lady Grantham,

311
00:22:41,723 --> 00:22:43,384
but that is how the law stands.

312
00:22:43,475 --> 00:22:46,185
Is there really no way to detach her money
from the estate?

313
00:22:46,269 --> 00:22:48,510
Even to me, it seems absurd.

314
00:22:48,814 --> 00:22:53,103
Your father tied the knots pretty tight.
I'd say it's unbreakable.

315
00:22:53,235 --> 00:22:54,396
I see.

316
00:22:55,737 --> 00:22:59,071
Really, Edith, do you have to put on
such an exhibition?

317
00:22:59,157 --> 00:23:00,568
She's not.

318
00:23:01,076 --> 00:23:03,829
I was supposed to be engaged to him,
for heaven's sake, not you.

319
00:23:03,913 --> 00:23:06,154
And I can control myself.

320
00:23:06,415 --> 00:23:08,622
Then you should be ashamed.

321
00:23:09,585 --> 00:23:13,123
Oh, and don't tell me
you've not sent up the egg yet.

322
00:23:16,384 --> 00:23:18,671
Oh, God, help me! Please, God, help me!

323
00:23:18,761 --> 00:23:20,179
Well, what on earth's the matter?

324
00:23:20,263 --> 00:23:22,806
Just run upstairs to the dining room
and find William. I beg you.

325
00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:24,722
-I can't do that now.
-You've got to.

326
00:23:24,809 --> 00:23:26,641
-I'll be hanged if you don't.
-What?

327
00:23:26,727 --> 00:23:28,309
Daisy, is that you?

328
00:23:28,396 --> 00:23:31,482
Is it the chicken in a sauce
or the plain chicken with sliced oranges?

329
00:23:31,566 --> 00:23:36,528
Oh, thank you, blessed and merciful Lord!
Thank you.

330
00:23:37,322 --> 00:23:38,740
It's the chicken in the sauce.

331
00:23:38,824 --> 00:23:43,113
I'll never do anything sinful
again, I swear it. Not till I die.

332
00:23:46,456 --> 00:23:49,744
Mr. Murray, how lovely to see you.
Do come in.

333
00:23:49,835 --> 00:23:52,796
You're very kind, Lady Grantham,
but I must get back to London.

334
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:57,295
-But you'll stay for luncheon?
-Thank you, but no, I'll eat on the train.

335
00:23:57,384 --> 00:24:01,754
In fact, if you'd be so good as to ask
for the motor be brought round?

336
00:24:01,848 --> 00:24:05,011
But didn't you want the afternoon
to talk things through?

337
00:24:05,101 --> 00:24:08,270
I think we've said everything we
have to say, haven't we, my lord?

338
00:24:08,354 --> 00:24:10,095
For the time being, yes.

339
00:24:10,189 --> 00:24:13,648
Thank you, Murray. You've given
me a good deal to think about.

340
00:24:17,488 --> 00:24:20,355
Mary, try to get everyone
into the dining room.

341
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:23,738
Edith, make sure old Lord Minterne
sits down.

342
00:24:27,248 --> 00:24:29,661
-[KNOCKING ON DOOR]
-Mmm-hmm.

343
00:24:30,502 --> 00:24:33,585
-They've all gone?
-They have, thank the Lord.

344
00:24:34,423 --> 00:24:37,586
-Oh, what about the lawyer?
-Oh, he was the first away.

345
00:24:37,676 --> 00:24:39,667
Didn't even stay for the luncheon.

346
00:24:39,762 --> 00:24:42,254
I wish they'd make their minds up.

347
00:24:42,348 --> 00:24:44,555
Gwen's put clean sheets
on the Blue Room bed.

348
00:24:44,642 --> 00:24:46,883
Now she'll just have to strip it again.

349
00:24:46,977 --> 00:24:51,096
-Can't you leave it for the next guest?
-Well, only if you don't tell.

350
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:52,680
[CHUCKLES]

351
00:24:54,485 --> 00:24:57,603
So, has it all been settled?

352
00:24:57,948 --> 00:25:00,656
No. I don't know if
anything's been settled.

353
00:25:00,742 --> 00:25:03,911
There's a fellow in Manchester
with claims to the title, I gather,

354
00:25:03,995 --> 00:25:07,829
but it's all a long way from settled.

355
00:25:08,083 --> 00:25:11,826
-You mustn't take it personally.
-No, I do take it personally, Mrs. Hughes.

356
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:16,881
I can't stand by and watch our family
threatened with a loss of all they hold dear.

357
00:25:17,467 --> 00:25:21,631
-They are not our family.
-Well, they're all the family I've got.

358
00:25:26,644 --> 00:25:28,476
I beg your pardon.

359
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:37,978
Do you ever wish you'd gone another way?

360
00:25:43,202 --> 00:25:47,412
Worked in a shop or a factory?
Had a wife and children?

361
00:25:48,457 --> 00:25:49,743
Do you?

362
00:25:52,253 --> 00:25:55,087
I don't know. Maybe.

363
00:25:55,674 --> 00:25:57,039
Sometimes.

364
00:25:57,968 --> 00:25:59,675
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]

365
00:25:59,761 --> 00:26:03,254
William's laid tea in the library,
but her ladyship hasn't come down.

366
00:26:03,348 --> 00:26:07,137
Oh, she'll be tired.
Take a tray up to her bedroom.

367
00:26:07,227 --> 00:26:09,889
-Is Thomas back?
-Not yet, Mr. Carson.

368
00:26:14,359 --> 00:26:17,509
He asked if he could run down the village,
I didn't see why not.

369
00:26:43,347 --> 00:26:45,054
It's iniquitous.

370
00:26:45,141 --> 00:26:49,180
They can't expect you to sit by silent
as your fortune is stolen away.

371
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:50,305
Can't they?

372
00:26:50,396 --> 00:26:53,310
His lordship would never let it happen.

373
00:26:53,984 --> 00:26:56,066
How's Bates working out?

374
00:26:56,653 --> 00:26:59,145
Well, I don't like to say.

375
00:27:01,158 --> 00:27:05,402
Only it seems unkind to criticize a man
for an affliction, my lady.

376
00:27:06,622 --> 00:27:09,284
Even if it means he can't do his job.

377
00:27:16,298 --> 00:27:18,335
How are you settling in?

378
00:27:18,967 --> 00:27:22,836
Very well, I think.
Unless your lordship feels differently.

379
00:27:23,139 --> 00:27:24,504
No complaints?

380
00:27:24,599 --> 00:27:27,727
If I had any, I should take them
to Mr. Carson, my lord, not you.

381
00:27:27,811 --> 00:27:29,176
[LAUGHS]

382
00:27:29,312 --> 00:27:31,269
You're probably right.

383
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:36,184
And the house hasn't worn you out
with the endless stairs and everything?

384
00:27:36,319 --> 00:27:39,983
I like the house, my lord.
I like it as a place to work.

385
00:27:41,866 --> 00:27:45,029
-What happened?
-Oh, it's only the old wound.

386
00:27:45,829 --> 00:27:47,955
After I left the army,
I'd a spot of bother

387
00:27:48,039 --> 00:27:53,035
and just when I got through that about
a year ago my knee started playing up.

388
00:27:53,379 --> 00:27:56,879
A bit of shrapnel got left in or something
and it moved, but it's fine.

389
00:27:57,007 --> 00:27:58,293
It's not a problem.

390
00:27:58,384 --> 00:28:01,797
And you'd let me know if you felt
it was all too much for you?

391
00:28:01,887 --> 00:28:04,003
I would. But it won't be.

392
00:28:06,058 --> 00:28:07,344
Thomas.

393
00:28:08,686 --> 00:28:11,303
-And where have you been?
-The village.

394
00:28:11,397 --> 00:28:15,686
-To send a telegram, if you must know.
-Ooh, pardon me for living.

395
00:28:21,491 --> 00:28:24,028
Well, Murray didn't stay long.

396
00:28:28,165 --> 00:28:30,827
-Does her ladyship know how they left it?
-No.

397
00:28:30,917 --> 00:28:34,410
They talked it all through
on the way back from the church.

398
00:28:34,504 --> 00:28:36,798
If I was still his valet,
I'd get it out of him.

399
00:28:36,882 --> 00:28:39,920
-Bates won't say a word.
-He will not.

400
00:28:41,511 --> 00:28:44,674
I bet you a tenner he's a spy
in the other direction.

401
00:28:45,891 --> 00:28:47,724
I wanted that job.

402
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,812
We were all right together,
his lordship and me.

403
00:28:49,896 --> 00:28:53,890
Then be sure to get your foot in the door
when Bates is gone.

404
00:28:54,025 --> 00:28:57,609
You can't get rid of him
just because he talks behind our backs.

405
00:28:57,737 --> 00:29:00,069
There's more than one way to skin a cat.

406
00:29:01,782 --> 00:29:05,366
-Perhaps she misunderstood.
-No, it was quite plain.

407
00:29:05,786 --> 00:29:08,369
O'Brien told her
Bates can't do the job properly.

408
00:29:08,456 --> 00:29:09,946
Why was he taken on?

409
00:29:10,082 --> 00:29:13,291
Oh, he was Lord Grantham's batman
when he was fighting the Boers.

410
00:29:13,377 --> 00:29:15,540
I know that, but even so.

411
00:29:15,631 --> 00:29:17,542
-I think it's romantic.
-I don't.

412
00:29:17,633 --> 00:29:19,715
How can a valet do his work if he's lame?

413
00:29:19,801 --> 00:29:21,633
He's not very lame.

414
00:29:21,929 --> 00:29:24,796
There. Anything else before I go down?

415
00:29:24,932 --> 00:29:27,094
No, that's it. Thank you.

416
00:29:35,817 --> 00:29:37,649
Oh, I hate black.

417
00:29:37,986 --> 00:29:39,397
It's not for long.

418
00:29:39,488 --> 00:29:42,401
Mama says we can go into
half-mourning next month.

419
00:29:42,491 --> 00:29:44,034
And back to colors by September.

420
00:29:44,118 --> 00:29:47,656
-Still seems a lot for a cousin.
-But not a fiancé?

421
00:29:51,668 --> 00:29:54,330
-He wasn't really a fiancé.
-No?

422
00:29:55,088 --> 00:29:58,422
I thought that was what you call a man
you're going to marry.

423
00:29:58,508 --> 00:30:01,591
I was only going to marry him
if nothing better turned up.

424
00:30:01,678 --> 00:30:04,511
-Mary, what a horrid thing to say.
-Don't worry.

425
00:30:04,597 --> 00:30:06,838
Edith would have taken him, wouldn't you?

426
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:09,512
Yes, I'd have taken him.

427
00:30:10,478 --> 00:30:14,689
If you'd given me the chance,
I'd have taken him like a shot.

428
00:30:15,943 --> 00:30:18,612
I just think you should know
it's not working, Mr. Carson.

429
00:30:18,696 --> 00:30:21,108
Do you mean Mr. Bates is lazy?

430
00:30:21,198 --> 00:30:25,192
Not lazy, exactly.
But he just can't carry.

431
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:27,078
He can hardly manage his lordship's cases.

432
00:30:27,162 --> 00:30:29,956
You saw how it was when they went up
to London for the memorial.

433
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,583
He can't help with
the guests' luggage neither.

434
00:30:31,667 --> 00:30:33,752
And as for waiting at table,
we can forget that.

435
00:30:33,836 --> 00:30:36,796
-And what do you want me to do?
-Well, it's not for me to say.

436
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:40,293
But is it fair on William
to have all the extra work?

437
00:30:40,385 --> 00:30:43,719
I don't believe you'd like to think
the house was falling below

438
00:30:43,805 --> 00:30:45,716
the way things ought to be.

439
00:30:45,849 --> 00:30:49,012
-I would not.
-That's all I'm saying.

440
00:30:58,987 --> 00:31:01,194
I'm going down. Coming?

441
00:31:01,823 --> 00:31:03,689
In a moment. You go.

442
00:31:13,002 --> 00:31:15,084
I know you're sad about Patrick.

443
00:31:15,171 --> 00:31:17,412
Whatever you say, I know it.

444
00:31:18,049 --> 00:31:20,086
You're a darling.

445
00:31:23,095 --> 00:31:26,087
But you see, I'm not
as sad as I should be.

446
00:31:26,349 --> 00:31:28,590
And that's what makes me sad.

447
00:31:30,603 --> 00:31:32,093
Thank you.

448
00:31:32,605 --> 00:31:35,518
-I'll do that.
-No. No, thank you, my lord.

449
00:31:35,608 --> 00:31:37,600
-I can do it.
-I'm sure.

450
00:31:38,945 --> 00:31:41,903
I hope so, my lord. I hope you're sure.

451
00:31:42,115 --> 00:31:44,447
Bates, we have to be sensible.

452
00:31:44,951 --> 00:31:47,912
I won't be doing you a favor in
the long run if it's too much for you.

453
00:31:47,996 --> 00:31:49,872
No matter what we've been through,
it's got to work.

454
00:31:49,956 --> 00:31:53,290
Of course it has, sir. I mean, my lord.

455
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,576
Do you miss the army, Bates?

456
00:31:55,670 --> 00:31:58,548
I miss a lot of things, but you have to
keep moving, don't you?

457
00:31:58,632 --> 00:32:00,623
[CHUCKLING] You do, indeed.

458
00:32:01,968 --> 00:32:05,177
I'll show you, my lord, I promise.
I won't let you down.

459
00:32:05,305 --> 00:32:07,923
We've managed so far, haven't we?

460
00:32:08,851 --> 00:32:10,637
Yes, we have. Of course we have.

461
00:32:11,479 --> 00:32:13,345
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]

462
00:32:14,482 --> 00:32:17,349
-You look very nice.
-Thank you, darling.

463
00:32:17,485 --> 00:32:21,524
-Did Murray make matters clearer?
-Yes, I'm afraid he did.

464
00:32:31,666 --> 00:32:35,752
By the way, O'Brien says Bates is
causing a lot of awkwardness downstairs.

465
00:32:35,838 --> 00:32:37,829
You may have to do something about it.

466
00:32:37,965 --> 00:32:40,332
She's always making trouble.

467
00:32:40,467 --> 00:32:43,801
Is that fair when she hasn't mentioned it
before now?

468
00:32:44,179 --> 00:32:46,136
I don't know why you listen to her.

469
00:32:46,390 --> 00:32:51,476
It is quite eccentric, even for you,
to have a crippled valet.

470
00:32:51,645 --> 00:32:54,637
Please, don't use that word.

471
00:32:55,023 --> 00:32:57,942
Did he tell you he couldn't walk
when he made his application?

472
00:32:58,026 --> 00:32:59,232
Don't exaggerate.

473
00:32:59,361 --> 00:33:01,978
Doesn't it strike you as dishonest
not to mention it?

474
00:33:02,072 --> 00:33:04,565
-I knew he'd been wounded.
-You never said.

475
00:33:04,701 --> 00:33:07,363
You know I don't care
to talk about all that.

476
00:33:07,495 --> 00:33:11,665
Of course I understand what it must be like
to have fought alongside someone in a war.

477
00:33:11,749 --> 00:33:14,457
-Oh, you understand that, do you?
-Certainly I do.

478
00:33:14,544 --> 00:33:17,206
You must form the most tremendous bonds.

479
00:33:17,338 --> 00:33:19,750
-Even with a servant.
-Really?

480
00:33:20,049 --> 00:33:21,881
Even with a servant?

481
00:33:22,051 --> 00:33:25,169
Oh, Robert, don't catch me out.

482
00:33:26,181 --> 00:33:29,219
I'm simply saying I fully see
why you want to help him.

483
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:30,340
But?

484
00:33:30,435 --> 00:33:34,270
But is this the right way,
to employ him for a job he can't do?

485
00:33:34,398 --> 00:33:36,817
Is it any wonder if the others' noses
are put out?

486
00:33:36,901 --> 00:33:38,562
I just want to give him a chance.

487
00:33:45,701 --> 00:33:48,068
Mama, I'm sorry,
no one told me you were here.

488

Oh, dear, such a glare.

489
00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:56,159
-I feel as if I were on stage at the Gaiety.
-ROBERT: We're used to it.

490
00:33:56,253 --> 00:33:59,673
I do wish you'd let me install it
in the Dower House. It's very convenient.

491
00:33:59,757 --> 00:34:02,510
The man who manages the generator
could look after yours as well.

492

now part of the estate.

-You may not mean to, but I bet you will.

Twenty-four years ago you married Cora,
against my wishes, for her money.

your peculiar marriage in the first place?

very happy, would that stretch belief?

Of course not, Bates.

Why did you apologize to that man?
It's not his business what we do.

674

I always apologize when I'm in the wrong.
It's a habit of mine.

675
00:46:53,641 --> 00:46:57,179
The plain fact is Mr. Bates,
through no fault of his own,

676
00:46:57,270 --> 00:47:00,729
Is not able to fulfill the extra duties
expected of him.

677
00:47:01,733 --> 00:47:07,524
He can't lift. He can't serve a table.
He's dropping things all over the place.

678
00:47:08,406 --> 00:47:11,740
On a night like tonight
he should act as a third footman.

As it is, my lord, we may have to have
a maid in the dining room.

Cheer up, Carson, there are worse things
happening in the world.

681
00:47:20,711 --> 00:47:23,294
Not worse than a maid serving a duke.

So you're quite determined?

683
00:47:30,012 --> 00:47:33,801
It's a hard decision, your lordship.
A very hard decision.

-But the honor of Downton is at stake.
-Don't worry, Carson.

685

William, you mustn't let
Thomas take advantage.

00:47:53,328 --> 00:47:55,820
He's only a footman, same as you.

689
00:47:56,498 --> 00:48:01,664
It's all right, Mrs. Hughes. I like to
keep busy. It takes your mind off things.

What things have you got
to take your mind off?

If you're feeling homesick,
there's no shame in it.

-No.
-It means you come from a happy home.

Yes, Mrs. Hughes.

-Yes.

I'm very sorry about that, my lord.
I don't know what happened.

The thing is, Bates,
I said I'd give you a trial and I have.

If it were only up to me...

701
00:48:58,478 --> 00:49:01,561
It's this question of
a valet's extra duties.

702
00:49:01,982 --> 00:49:03,900
You mean waiting a table
when there's a large party?

That and carrying things and...

704
00:49:10,949 --> 00:49:15,410
You do see that Carson can't be expected
to compromise the efficiency of his staff.

I do, my lord, of course I do.

706
00:49:18,458 --> 00:49:20,620
Might I make a suggestion?

707
00:49:21,127 --> 00:49:24,380
That when an extra footman is required,
the cost could come out of my wages.

708
00:49:24,464 --> 00:49:26,796
Absolutely not.
I couldn't possibly allow that.

709
00:49:26,883 --> 00:49:30,922
Because I am very eager to stay, my lord.
Very eager, indeed.

710
00:49:33,014 --> 00:49:36,598
I know you are.
And I was eager that this should work.

711
00:49:40,229 --> 00:49:44,269
You see, it is unlikely that I should find
another position.

712
00:49:44,568 --> 00:49:47,362
But surely in a smaller house,
where less is expected of you.

713
00:49:47,446 --> 00:49:48,902
It's not likely.

714
00:49:50,282 --> 00:49:52,117
I mean to help until you find something.

715
00:49:52,201 --> 00:49:57,037
I couldn't take your money, my lord. I
can take wages for a job done. That's all.

716
00:50:04,338 --> 00:50:06,955
Very good, my lord. I'll go at once.

00:50:07,341 --> 00:50:10,093
There's no need to rush out into the
night. Take the London train tomorrow.

It's a bloody business, Bates,
but I can't see any way around it.

-Mmm, absolutely.

00:57:12,364 --> 00:57:15,607
-My dear Lord Grantham...
-Don't "My dear Lord Grantham" me!

815
00:57:15,700 --> 00:57:18,944
You knew what you were doing
when you came here.

816
00:57:19,205 --> 00:57:21,572
You encouraged Mary, all of us,
into thinking...

817
00:57:21,666 --> 00:57:25,910
Forgive me, but I came to express
my sympathies and my friendship.

818
00:57:26,003 --> 00:57:27,414
Nothing more.

819
00:57:29,298 --> 00:57:34,008
Lady Mary is a charming person.
Whoever marries her will be a lucky man.

820
00:57:35,096 --> 00:57:37,463
It will not, however, be me.

821
00:57:37,890 --> 00:57:41,849
I see, and what was it you asked me
to stay behind to hear?

822
00:57:45,940 --> 00:57:47,557
I... I forget.

823
00:58:02,165 --> 00:58:05,374
Well, aren't you coming
into the drawing room?

824
00:58:05,711 --> 00:58:10,205
I'm... I'm tired. I think I'll just slip
away. Please make my excuses.

825
00:58:10,799 --> 00:58:13,962
I'm afraid I've worn you out.
Tomorrow we can just...

826
00:58:14,052 --> 00:58:17,262
I'm leaving in the morning. Good night.

827
00:58:20,351 --> 00:58:22,592
Oh, you might tell that footman...

828
00:58:22,854 --> 00:58:26,347
-Thomas.
-Thomas. You might tell him I've gone up.

829
00:58:44,334 --> 00:58:46,325
So he slipped the hook?

830
00:58:48,505 --> 00:58:51,418
At least I'm not fishing with no bait.

831
00:59:00,559 --> 00:59:02,516
I don't believe that.

832
00:59:03,228 --> 00:59:07,187
Well, believe what you like.
He won't break the entail.

833
00:59:08,817 --> 00:59:11,400
The unknown cousin gets everything

834
00:59:12,279 --> 00:59:15,116
[SIGHING] and Mary's inheritance
will be the same as it always was.

835
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:17,159
Oh, how was I to know?
When the lawyer turned up, I thought...

836
00:59:17,243 --> 00:59:20,486
You weren't to and you did the right thing
to telegraph me.

837
00:59:20,622 --> 00:59:23,785
-It's just not going to come off.
-So what now?

838
00:59:25,877 --> 00:59:28,835
[LAUGHS] Well, you know how I'm fixed.

839
00:59:30,173 --> 00:59:34,713
I have to have an heiress,
if it means going to New York to find one.

840
00:59:37,097 --> 00:59:38,713
What about me?

841
00:59:41,310 --> 00:59:44,723
You... You will wish me well.

842
00:59:45,314 --> 00:59:48,181
You said you'd find me a job
if I wanted to leave.

843
00:59:48,275 --> 00:59:49,731
And do you?

844
00:59:50,736 --> 00:59:53,030
I want to be a valet.
I'm sick of being a footman.

845
00:59:53,114 --> 00:59:55,731
Yeah, Thomas, I don't need a valet.

846
00:59:57,868 --> 00:59:59,995
I thought you were
getting rid of the new one here.

847
01:00:00,079 --> 01:00:04,619
And I've done it, but I'm not sure
Carson's going to let me take over.

848
01:00:08,129 --> 01:00:10,292
And I want to be with you.

849
01:00:10,841 --> 01:00:12,002
Mmm.

850
01:00:24,146 --> 01:00:27,013
I just can't see it working, can you?

851
01:00:28,191 --> 01:00:32,111
[LAUGHING] We don't seem to have the basis
of a servant-master relationship, do we?

852
01:00:32,195 --> 01:00:35,688
-You came here to be with me.
-Among other reasons.

853
01:00:39,162 --> 01:00:42,325
And one swallow doesn't make a summer.

854
01:00:58,389 --> 01:01:01,256
-Aren't you forgetting something?
-What?

855
01:01:02,935 --> 01:01:05,427
[LAUGHS] Are you threatening me?

856
01:01:08,567 --> 01:01:11,184
Because of a youthful dalliance?

857
01:01:11,278 --> 01:01:13,279
A few weeks of madness
in a London season?

858
01:01:13,363 --> 01:01:15,198
You wouldn't hold that against me, surely?

859
01:01:15,282 --> 01:01:17,239
I would if I have to.

860
01:01:22,414 --> 01:01:26,123
And who'd believe a greedy footman
over the words of a duke?

861
01:01:26,210 --> 01:01:29,578
If you're not careful,
you'll end up behind bars.

862
01:01:30,088 --> 01:01:31,829
I've got proof.

863
01:01:33,300 --> 01:01:34,756
Mmm-hmm.

864
01:01:36,137 --> 01:01:37,844
You mean these?

865
01:01:43,937 --> 01:01:45,678
[BOTH GRUNTING]

866
01:01:51,945 --> 01:01:53,606
[THOMAS PANTING]

867
01:01:54,280 --> 01:01:57,944
You know, my mother's always telling me
never put anything in writing.

868
01:01:58,034 --> 01:02:00,947
And now, thanks to
you, I never will again.

869
01:02:01,037 --> 01:02:02,493
How did you get them?

870
01:02:03,122 --> 01:02:06,286
-You bastard.
-Don't be a bad loser, Thomas.

871
01:02:06,460 --> 01:02:07,950
Go to bed.

872
01:02:09,338 --> 01:02:11,375
Unless you want to stay.

873
01:02:40,328 --> 01:02:42,035
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]

874
01:02:44,332 --> 01:02:46,619
I think I'll turn in.

875
01:02:46,710 --> 01:02:49,077
-No big announcement, then?
-No.

876
01:02:49,170 --> 01:02:52,288
Nor likely to be. He's
off on the 9:00 train.

877
01:02:52,382 --> 01:02:53,838
He never is!

878
01:02:53,925 --> 01:02:56,719
And when we've had a turkey killed
for tomorrow's dinner!

879
01:02:56,803 --> 01:03:00,046
-I wonder what she did wrong.
-She did nothing wrong.

880
01:03:00,140 --> 01:03:03,008
Not from the way his lordship was talking.

881
01:03:03,185 --> 01:03:06,268
So His Grace turned out to be graceless.

882
01:03:08,357 --> 01:03:10,439
Good night, Mrs. Hughes.

883
01:03:10,526 --> 01:03:12,483
Good night, Mr. Carson.

884
01:03:15,948 --> 01:03:19,486
If you knew that was your decision,
why put Mary through it?

885
01:03:19,577 --> 01:03:23,571
But I didn't know it was my decision,
my final decision, until tonight.

886
01:03:23,664 --> 01:03:28,033
But I find I cannot ruin the estate or
hollow out the title for the sake of Mary,

887
01:03:28,127 --> 01:03:30,665
even with a better man than that.

888
01:03:30,756 --> 01:03:33,248
I try to understand. I just can't.

889
01:03:33,342 --> 01:03:36,380
Well, why should you?
Downton is in my blood and in my bones.

890
01:03:36,470 --> 01:03:38,086
It's not in yours.

891
01:03:38,180 --> 01:03:40,223
And I can no more be the cause
of its destruction

892
01:03:40,307 --> 01:03:42,389
than I could betray my country.

893
01:03:42,476 --> 01:03:45,311
Besides, how was I to know
he wouldn't take her without the money?

894
01:03:45,395 --> 01:03:47,730
Don't pretend to be a child
because it suits you.

895
01:03:47,814 --> 01:03:50,733
[SIGHING] Do you think she would've
been happy with a fortune hunter?

896
01:03:50,817 --> 01:03:52,603
She might've been.

897
01:03:53,028 --> 01:03:54,234
I was.

898
01:03:57,449 --> 01:04:01,409
Have you been happy?
Really, have I made you happy?

899
01:04:02,288 --> 01:04:03,870
Yes.

900
01:04:07,585 --> 01:04:10,963
That is, since you fell in love with me,
which, if I remember correctly,

901
01:04:11,047 --> 01:04:13,539
was about a year after we were married.

902
01:04:13,633 --> 01:04:16,546
Not a year. Not as long as that.

903
01:04:17,095 --> 01:04:20,554
-But it wouldn't have happened for Mary.
-Why not?

904
01:04:21,140 --> 01:04:25,134
Because I am so much nicer
than the Duke of Crowborough.

905
01:04:25,770 --> 01:04:27,063
I'll be the judge of that.

906
01:04:27,147 --> 01:04:28,933
[ROBERT CHUCKLES]

907
01:04:31,026 --> 01:04:34,064
Just don't think
I'm going to let it rest, Robert.

908
01:04:34,154 --> 01:04:36,691
I haven't given up by any means.

909
01:04:38,492 --> 01:04:43,032
-I must do what my conscience tells me.
-And so must I.

910
01:04:44,790 --> 01:04:48,158
And I don't want you
to think I'll let it rest.

911
01:04:48,961 --> 01:04:50,668
[ROBERT CHUCKLES]

912
01:05:00,682 --> 01:05:05,267
My lord, would it be acceptable
for Bates to ride in front with Taylor?

913
01:05:05,353 --> 01:05:07,563
Otherwise, it means
getting the other car out.

914
01:05:07,647 --> 01:05:10,059
He and His Grace are
catching the same train.

915
01:05:10,150 --> 01:05:11,982
Perfectly acceptable.

916
01:05:12,068 --> 01:05:15,436
And if His Grace doesn't like it,
he can lump it.

917
01:05:29,003 --> 01:05:31,213
You've been so kind, Lady Grantham.
Thank you.

918
01:05:31,297 --> 01:05:32,958
Goodbye, Duke.

919
01:05:33,299 --> 01:05:35,759
You'll make my farewells
to your delightful daughters?

920
01:05:35,843 --> 01:05:38,178
They'd have been down
if they'd known you were leaving so soon.

921
01:05:38,262 --> 01:05:41,550
Alas, something's come up
which has taken me quite by surprise.

922
01:05:41,640 --> 01:05:43,096
Obviously.

923
01:05:43,476 --> 01:05:46,353
Well, Grantham, this has been
a highly enjoyable interlude.

924
01:05:46,437 --> 01:05:48,772
Has it? And I feared it had
proved a disappointment.

925
01:05:48,856 --> 01:05:50,062
Not at all, not at all.

926
01:05:50,149 --> 01:05:52,610
A short stay in your lovely house
has driven away my cares.

927
01:05:52,694 --> 01:05:56,653
We ought to go, my lord,
if His Grace is to catch the train.

928
01:05:59,117 --> 01:06:01,575
Goodbye, Bates, and good luck.

929
01:06:03,205 --> 01:06:05,321
Good luck to you, my lord.

930
01:06:23,893 --> 01:06:25,224
Wait!

931
01:06:28,189 --> 01:06:31,432
-Get out, Bates.
-DUKE: I really mustn't be late.

932
01:06:33,444 --> 01:06:36,732
Get back inside
and we'll say no more about it.

933
01:06:51,797 --> 01:06:53,959
It wasn't right, Carson.

934
01:06:54,633 --> 01:06:57,125
I just didn't think it was right.

935
01:07:14,570 --> 01:07:17,312
-First post, ma'am.
-Thank you, Ellen.

936
01:07:20,910 --> 01:07:23,823
-One for you.
-Hmm. Thank you, Mother.

937
01:07:34,257 --> 01:07:38,751
-Oh, it's from Lord Grantham.
-Really? What on earth does he want?

938
01:07:41,598 --> 01:07:43,930
He wants to change our lives.
