1
00:00:02,336 --> 00:00:04,384
<i><b>What are you thinking about?
Just thinking about names.</b></i>

2
00:00:04,463 --> 00:00:05,555
<i><b>It's just that, if I'm
going to help raise him,</b></i>

3
00:00:05,631 --> 00:00:06,848
<i><b>I'd like to give him
something.</b></i>

4
00:00:06,924 --> 00:00:08,517
<i><b>You're going to be the one
who gave him his last name.</b></i>

5
00:00:08,592 --> 00:00:10,845
<i><b>My little guy,
he got asthma.</b></i>

6
00:00:10,928 --> 00:00:12,350
<i><b>The window
in the living room,</b></i>

7
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:14,181
<i><b>it's been broken
for seven months.</b></i>

8
00:00:14,264 --> 00:00:16,187
<i><b>His client hasn't paid her
rent in three months.</b></i>

9
00:00:16,266 --> 00:00:18,644
<i><b>She's had no heat and a
broken window all winter,</b></i>

10
00:00:18,727 --> 00:00:20,479
<i><b>despite repeated requests
for repairs.</b></i>

11
00:00:20,562 --> 00:00:21,814
<i><b>We don't have it
in writing,</b></i>

12
00:00:21,897 --> 00:00:23,774
<i><b>which is what
the court requires.</b></i>

13
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:25,977
<i><b>I'd like to request time
to confer with my supervisor.</b></i>

14
00:00:26,068 --> 00:00:27,490
<i><b>You have to help him.
I can't.</b></i>

15
00:00:27,611 --> 00:00:29,329
<i><b>We are requesting
permission to evict</b></i>

16
00:00:29,613 --> 00:00:32,287
<i><b>if we don't have a check
by 10:00 a.m. tomorrow.</b></i>

17
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:33,834
<i><b>$3,600?</b></i>

18
00:00:33,909 --> 00:00:35,877
<i><b>Should be enough to cover your
rent for the last three months.</b></i>

19
00:00:35,953 --> 00:00:37,079
<i><b>I don't know what to say.</b></i>

20
00:00:37,162 --> 00:00:38,209
<i><b>This is a job offer.</b></i>

21
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:39,460
<i><b>When you graduate,
you're going to have to</b></i>

22
00:00:39,581 --> 00:00:41,834
<i><b>pass the character and fitness test.
And you think</b></i>

23
00:00:41,917 --> 00:00:45,091
<i><b>working at your firm looks
better than working at mine.</b></i>

24
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:46,638
<i><b>You're gonna tell me
you had nothing to do</b></i>

25
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:50,058
<i><b>with Harvey asking me to
help you get a law license?</b></i>

26
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:51,476
<i><b>I wasn't even on her radar.</b></i>

27
00:00:51,552 --> 00:00:54,476
<i><b>I had one thing I wanted to
do and you ruined it for me</b></i>

28
00:00:54,555 --> 00:00:55,772
<i><b>just because
you can't accept the fact</b></i>

29
00:00:55,847 --> 00:00:56,848
<i><b>that I don't want
to come back here.</b></i>

30
00:00:56,932 --> 00:00:58,058
<i><b>I wasn't trying
to get you back.</b></i>

31
00:00:58,141 --> 00:00:59,734
<i><b>I was trying to help you.
I don't believe you.</b></i>

32
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:01,653
<i><b>Stop messing with my life.</b></i>

33
00:01:29,006 --> 00:01:31,759
<i><b>Hey. Mike.
What are you doing here?</b></i>

34
00:01:31,842 --> 00:01:34,846
<i><b>I came to apologize for yelling
at you about going to Gibbs.</b></i>

35
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,268
<i><b>You don't have to do that.
Yes, I do.</b></i>

36
00:01:37,556 --> 00:01:39,229
<i><b>I know you only had
my best interests at heart.</b></i>

37
00:01:39,308 --> 00:01:41,276
<i><b>You always do. And...</b></i>

38
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:43,399
<i><b>I shouldn't have
snapped at you.</b></i>

39
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:45,105
<i><b>Well, I shouldn't
have gone to her</b></i>

40
00:01:45,188 --> 00:01:46,735
<i><b>behind your back.
That's okay.</b></i>

41
00:01:48,317 --> 00:01:49,534
<i><b>It kind of worked out.</b></i>

42
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:52,037
<i><b>Come on in.
Let's have a drink.</b></i>

43
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:54,031
<i><b>You can tell me
all about it.</b></i>

44
00:01:59,328 --> 00:02:01,330
<i><b>Are you kidding me? A legal clinic?
Mmm-hmm.</b></i>

45
00:02:01,413 --> 00:02:03,493
<i><b>I thought Gibbs told you
she'd never let that happen.</b></i>

46
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,213
<i><b>Yeah, by telling people
I was a fraud.</b></i>

47
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:07,169
<i><b>Turns out, the one guy
who knew I was a fraud</b></i>

48
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:08,970
<i><b>from years ago
runs the clinic.</b></i>

49
00:02:09,046 --> 00:02:11,925
<i><b>Not only was he willing to hire
me, he was happy about it.</b></i>

50
00:02:12,007 --> 00:02:13,600
<i><b>Seems like crime does pay.</b></i>

51
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:15,677
<i><b>You bet your ass it does.</b></i>

52
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:19,139
<i><b>What? You're never
going to believe it,</b></i>

53
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:22,317
<i><b>but they have me supervising
this third-year law student</b></i>

54
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:23,484
<i><b>who thinks she knows
more than me.</b></i>

55
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,903
<i><b>You mean you have a you.</b></i>

56
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:26,195
<i><b>She is so much worse
than me.</b></i>

57
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:28,649
<i><b>She constantly talking about
what a great memory she has?</b></i>

58
00:02:28,732 --> 00:02:29,824
<i><b>Oh...
Dresses shitty?</b></i>

59
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,868
<i><b>She have a man purse?
You done?</b></i>

60
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:33,035
<i><b>Why?</b></i>

61
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:34,551
<i><b>You have some place
you've got to be?</b></i>

62
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:37,575
<i><b>Actually, I am supposed to stay away
from our apartment for a while.</b></i>

63
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:40,535
<i><b>So, anyway, I said
to Louis, "I don't care</b></i>

64
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:42,830
<i><b>"if most of the associates
start in the bullpen.</b></i>

65
00:02:42,913 --> 00:02:46,338
<i><b>"I'm not giving up
my office."</b></i>

66
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:47,417
<i><b>That's great, Rachel.</b></i>

67
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:49,344
<i><b>But I'm on my third glass
of chardonnay</b></i>

68
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:50,841
<i><b>and I don't think
you called me over here</b></i>

69
00:02:50,921 --> 00:02:53,161
<i><b>to tell me that you submitted
your application to the Bar</b></i>

70
00:02:53,215 --> 00:02:55,135
<i><b>or that you're putting
your foot down with Louis.</b></i>

71
00:02:56,551 --> 00:03:00,601
<i><b>You're right. I called you
over here to tell you that</b></i>

72
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:02,149
<i><b>I put my foot down
with Mike.</b></i>

73
00:03:02,808 --> 00:03:05,311
<i><b>You finally told him to pick a
hairstyle and stick with it?</b></i>

74
00:03:05,394 --> 00:03:06,646
<i><b>No.</b></i>

75
00:03:07,104 --> 00:03:09,198
<i><b>I finally told him</b></i>

76
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:12,947
<i><b>that he made me a promise
before he went away.</b></i>

77
00:03:13,652 --> 00:03:16,906
<i><b>And now that he's back
and gainfully employed,</b></i>

78
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:20,037
<i><b>it's time for him to
make an honest woman of me.</b></i>

79
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:23,879
<i><b>Rachel, I am so happy
for you.</b></i>

80
00:03:25,664 --> 00:03:26,916
<i><b>And the answer is yes.</b></i>

81
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:28,750
<i><b>What answer?</b></i>

82
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:30,965
<i><b>I didn't ask you
a question yet.</b></i>

83
00:03:31,128 --> 00:03:33,597
<i><b>Yes, you did. And I'd be thrilled
to be your maid of honor.</b></i>

84
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:35,841
<i><b>Thank you, Donna.</b></i>

85
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:38,385
<i><b>Mike, that's great.</b></i>

86
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:40,307
<i><b>I'm happy for you.</b></i>

87
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:41,914
<i><b>You still up
for being my best man?</b></i>

88
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,682
<i><b>Wouldn't miss it
for the world.</b></i>

89
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:45,187
<i><b>We going back
to the church?</b></i>

90
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:48,062
<i><b>No. We're going to do it
at our place this time.</b></i>

91
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:49,192
<i><b>No. You can't do that.</b></i>

92
00:03:49,438 --> 00:03:51,782
<i><b>Yeah, we just want to keep it small.
And intimate.</b></i>

93
00:03:51,857 --> 00:03:53,279
<i><b>I understand. But what kind
of best man would I be</b></i>

94
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:55,235
<i><b>if I didn't offer for you
to have it here?</b></i>

95
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:57,070
<i><b>Pretty shitty one,
if you ask me.</b></i>

96
00:03:58,155 --> 00:04:00,283
<i><b>So, basically,
you came here to apologize</b></i>

97
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:03,164
<i><b>so you didn't have to get married
at your shitty little apartment.</b></i>

98
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,245
<i><b>You think that I'd ask you
to be my best man</b></i>

99
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:06,830
<i><b>if we had
a better location?</b></i>

100
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:10,087
<i><b>Congratulations.</b></i>

101
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,752
<i><b>Thanks, Harvey.</b></i>

102
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:16,382
<i><b>Now all we need to do is make sure
you don't skip out on this one.</b></i>

103
00:04:16,465 --> 00:04:17,682
<i><b>Yeah, that's funny.</b></i>

104
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:18,930
<i><b>We also need to make sure
that you don't...</b></i>

105
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:20,306
<i><b>Donna at the wedding.</b></i>

106
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:21,762
<i><b>What did you just say?
Huh?</b></i>

107
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:24,543
<i><b>You got something caught in your throat?
No, I'm all good.</b></i>

108
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:31,068
<i><b>See the money,
wanna stay for your meal</b></i>

109
00:04:31,146 --> 00:04:34,525
<i><b>Get another piece of pie

112
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:44,455
<i><b>I'll even eat a bean pie

00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:36,810
<i><b>'Cause I got news for you.</b></i>

161
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:38,861
<i><b>This mainframe needs
a new memory stick</b></i>

162
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,942
<i><b>a hell of a lot more
than once a quarter.</b></i>

163
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:42,198
<i><b>That's it.
I'm finished.</b></i>

164
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,196
<i><b>I would walk you through
the hard restart,</b></i>

165
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:46,577
<i><b>but I'm afraid you'd focus on all
the wrong words in that sentence.</b></i>

166
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:49,705
<i><b>Oh, no. Right now, I'm just focused
on the fact that you're finished.</b></i>

167
00:06:50,452 --> 00:06:52,932
<i><b>Now leave your money on the table
so I can watch you walk away.</b></i>

168
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:58,175
<i><b>Mmm!</b></i>

169
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:00,430
<i><b>You mind telling me
what that was all about?</b></i>

170
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:04,091
<i><b>You mean me making sexually
suggestive comments to our IT guy?</b></i>

171
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:05,471
<i><b>He has a name, you know.
I do.</b></i>

172
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,268
<i><b>But I'd be shocked
if you knew what it was.</b></i>

173
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:08,682
<i><b>That's not the point.</b></i>

174
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:12,892
<i><b>No, Harvey. The point is, I'm
not doing anything to him.</b></i>

175
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:14,772
<i><b>I'm doing it for him.</b></i>

176
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:16,774
<i><b>And how exactly
do you figure that?</b></i>

177
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:17,945
<i><b>I figure that because</b></i>

178
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:20,774
<i><b>Benjamin updates everybody
else's computers remotely.</b></i>

179
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:22,700
<i><b>And once a quarter,
he's down here,</b></i>

180
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:24,449
<i><b>pretending not to
like my act.</b></i>

181
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:27,280
<i><b>So, unless you want me to focus
my rapier-like wit on you,</b></i>

182
00:07:27,364 --> 00:07:30,413
<i><b>I suggest you walk your pretty
little self back into your office.</b></i>

183
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:32,168
<i><b>Benjamin.</b></i>

184
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:34,420
<i><b>I knew it.
No, you didn't.</b></i>

185
00:07:43,046 --> 00:07:44,969
<i><b>Mike,
thank God you're here.</b></i>

186
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:46,300
<i><b>Sofia Price just called.</b></i>

187
00:07:46,383 --> 00:07:48,623
<i><b>She's been in the hospital
since last night with her son.</b></i>

188
00:07:48,677 --> 00:07:50,395
<i><b>Is he okay?
I think so, for now.</b></i>

189
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,642
<i><b>It was an asthma attack.</b></i>

190
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:52,722
<i><b>But she wanted me
to tell you that she...</b></i>

191
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:55,366
<i><b>That she couldn't drop off the
check for her rent. Damn it. Um...</b></i>

192
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:57,777
<i><b>Call her back. Tell her I'm on it.
Mike, wait.</b></i>

193
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:01,823
<i><b>You covered what she owed with
your own money, didn't you?</b></i>

194
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:03,320
<i><b>Because that's above
and beyond...</b></i>

195
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,777
<i><b>We can talk about
how awesome I am later.</b></i>

196
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:05,860
<i><b>Right now,
I need to make sure</b></i>

197
00:08:05,944 --> 00:08:07,571
<i><b>that Sofia's rent
is paid by 10:00.</b></i>

198
00:08:11,408 --> 00:08:13,081
<i><b>Louis, can I talk to you?</b></i>

199
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:14,540
<i><b>Of course.</b></i>

200
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,839
<i><b>I... I don't even know what to do.
My hands are shaking.</b></i>

201
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:19,211
<i><b>Rachel, what's going on?</b></i>

202
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:21,585
<i><b>I'm not getting into the Bar.</b></i>

203
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:22,920
<i><b>What? That's ridiculous.</b></i>

204
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:24,220
<i><b>Read this.</b></i>

205
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:26,256
<i><b>Let's see this.</b></i>

206
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:27,556
<i><b>"After careful review
of your application,</b></i>

209
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,352
<i><b>This is bullshit.
I know.</b></i>

210
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:32,805
<i><b>Because I knew I was going
to have to defend myself,</b></i>

211
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:34,487
<i><b>but I didn't think
I wasn't even going to</b></i>

212
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,187
<i><b>have the chance
to defend myself.</b></i>

213
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:38,109
<i><b>Okay. Calm down.
How can I calm down?</b></i>

214
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:39,824
<i><b>This is exactly
what my dad was afraid of.</b></i>

215
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:42,488
<i><b>He said that they'd hold my
relationship with Mike against me.</b></i>

216
00:08:42,564 --> 00:08:43,884
<i><b>You don't know
this is about Mike.</b></i>

217
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:45,984
<i><b>Of course,
it's about Mike. What...</b></i>

218
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:48,244
<i><b>What else would it be about?</b></i>

219
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:50,321
<i><b>It could be a mix-up,
some kind of clerical error.</b></i>

220
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:52,247
<i><b>You could have filled out
the paperwork wrong.</b></i>

221
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:54,167
<i><b>I went over it 10 times.</b></i>

222
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:56,374
<i><b>Rachel, there is
an explanation for this</b></i>

223
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:57,545
<i><b>and I'm going to get
to the bottom of it.</b></i>

224
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,463
<i><b>You don't know that.
Look at me.</b></i>

225
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:03,631
<i><b>I promise you will
get your interview. Okay?</b></i>

226
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:05,461
<i><b>Okay.</b></i>

227
00:09:12,177 --> 00:09:13,679
<i><b>Harvey, we have a problem.</b></i>

228
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:14,934
<i><b>What is it?</b></i>

229
00:09:16,473 --> 00:09:17,473
<i><b>This is about Mike.</b></i>

230
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:18,732
<i><b>Of course it's about Mike.
That's why I came here</b></i>

231
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:20,310
<i><b>the second
Rachel left my office.</b></i>

232
00:09:20,435 --> 00:09:22,233
<i><b>What did you tell Rachel?
What do you think I told her?</b></i>

233
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:23,780
<i><b>I told her that it must be
some kind of mistake.</b></i>

234
00:09:23,855 --> 00:09:24,902
<i><b>But you and I
both know it's not,</b></i>

235
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:26,028
<i><b>which means
you need to fix this.</b></i>

236
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:28,235
<i><b>Yeah, I do need to fix it
and I will.</b></i>

237
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:30,495
<i><b>But normally,</b></i>

238
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,743
<i><b>instead of coming to me,
you'd go full steam ahead</b></i>

239
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:35,416
<i><b>and do something that makes the
situation significantly worse.</b></i>

240
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:36,994
<i><b>Possibly.
What are you getting at?</b></i>

241
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,037
<i><b>Why did you come to me?</b></i>

242
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:42,666
<i><b>Because we said
we'd run this firm together.</b></i>

243
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:45,093
<i><b>And if we're gonna do that, then
I have to be honest with myself</b></i>

244
00:09:45,168 --> 00:09:46,636
<i><b>about what I'm good at
and what you're good at.</b></i>

245
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:49,031
<i><b>And you know I'm better at this
kind of thing than you are.</b></i>

246
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:50,511
<i><b>I do.</b></i>

247
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,434
<i><b>Louis, that shows real growth.
Thank you, Harvey.</b></i>

248
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:54,511
<i><b>And it shows growth
on your part</b></i>

249
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:58,064
<i><b>not to make light of the fact that
I just admitted something that was</b></i>

250
00:09:58,139 --> 00:09:59,812
<i><b>very difficult
for me to admit.</b></i>

251
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:02,106
<i><b>You mean that I'm better
at everything than you.</b></i>

252
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:05,064
<i><b>That's not what I said. Too bad.
Because it's what I heard.</b></i>

253
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:07,065
<i><b>Okay.
Harvey, seriously.</b></i>

254
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:08,616
<i><b>This is not about
you having fun with me.</b></i>

255
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:09,988
<i><b>This is about Rachel.</b></i>

256
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:14,239
<i><b>I know it is. And if I weren't confident
that I could take care of it,</b></i>

257
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:16,040
<i><b>I wouldn't be giving you
a hard time</b></i>

258
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:18,039
<i><b>for admitting how much better
I am at everything than you.</b></i>

259
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:19,961
<i><b>God damn it.
Sorry, Louis.</b></i>

260
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:21,583
<i><b>Got to go be
better at something.</b></i>

261
00:10:21,663 --> 00:10:22,710
<i><b>See you later.</b></i>

262
00:10:31,923 --> 00:10:33,015
<i><b>Can I help you?</b></i>

263
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:34,684
<i><b>Yes, you can.
My name is Mike Ross.</b></i>

264
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:36,978
<i><b>I'm here on behalf
of Sofia Price.</b></i>

265
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:39,397
<i><b>And this is every dime of
rent she owes your client.</b></i>

266
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:41,770
<i><b>And why exactly
are you bringing that to me?</b></i>

267
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:43,397
<i><b>Because you're an attorney,
not a landlord.</b></i>

268
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:45,899
<i><b>And I don't want there
to be any misunderstandings.</b></i>

269
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:48,277
<i><b>What I understand
is that it's 10:18,</b></i>

270
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:50,108
<i><b>and your client
had until 10:00.</b></i>

271
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:51,488
<i><b>You have got to be
shitting me.</b></i>

272
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:52,911
<i><b>I most certainly am not.</b></i>

273
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:54,533
<i><b>And maybe your client
should have thought of that</b></i>

274
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:56,990
<i><b>before not paying
her rent all those months.</b></i>

275
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:58,325
<i><b>You think I don't know
what's going on here?</b></i>

276
00:10:58,408 --> 00:11:00,285
<i><b>You're trying to get her out so
that you can get this place out</b></i>

277
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:02,666
<i><b>from under rent control. But I'm not
gonna let you get away with it.</b></i>

278
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:04,705
<i><b>No, what's going on here
is that my client is sick</b></i>

279
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:08,297
<i><b>of having a troublemaker who
doesn't pay her rent as a tenant.</b></i>

280
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:09,376
<i><b>Listen to me.</b></i>

281
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:12,389
<i><b>You cannot evict her now.
Her son is in the hospital.</b></i>

282
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:13,760
<i><b>I have a job to do.</b></i>

283
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,844
<i><b>Now, I am sorry
about your client's son.</b></i>

284
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:20,430
<i><b>But the court was very clear, and
there's nothing more that I can do.</b></i>

285
00:11:26,603 --> 00:11:28,025
<i><b>Mike.
What happened?</b></i>

286
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:29,572
<i><b>I got there
18 minutes late.</b></i>

287
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:31,767
<i><b>What does that matter? You
had three months back rent.</b></i>

288
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:33,409
<i><b>They want to kick her out
to get out of rent control.</b></i>

289
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:34,531
<i><b>And now that
we've missed the deadline,</b></i>

290
00:11:34,611 --> 00:11:35,863
<i><b>there's nothing
we can do about it.</b></i>

291
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:37,367
<i><b>Wrong. There is.</b></i>

292
00:11:37,739 --> 00:11:39,207
<i><b>I got to thinking. Why would
they be in such a hurry</b></i>

293
00:11:39,282 --> 00:11:41,563
<i><b>to evict somebody who can
actually come up with the money?</b></i>

294
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:43,499
<i><b>They're not just
trying to get her out,</b></i>

295
00:11:43,578 --> 00:11:44,670
<i><b>they're trying to
get everyone out.</b></i>

296
00:11:44,746 --> 00:11:45,963
<i><b>Exactly.</b></i>

297
00:11:46,289 --> 00:11:47,461
<i><b>They're going to demolish
that whole building.</b></i>

298
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,792
<i><b>I was over there last night.</b></i>

299
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:49,876
<i><b>The workers
were already there.</b></i>

300
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:51,381
<i><b>Which means
they've already started.</b></i>

301
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:53,680
<i><b>I get it. You want to hit
them with a countersuit.</b></i>

302
00:11:53,755 --> 00:11:54,847
<i><b>I want to nail their asses
to the wall.</b></i>

303
00:11:54,923 --> 00:11:56,015
<i><b>Now, you guys
get to work on the suit.</b></i>

304
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,091
<i><b>I'm going
to go talk to Nathan</b></i>

305
00:11:57,175 --> 00:11:59,473
<i><b>about stopping Sofia's eviction
from happening in the meantime.</b></i>

306
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:00,769
<i><b>Mike.</b></i>

307
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:04,641
<i><b>You don't need to go to Nathan.
I can handle this.</b></i>

308
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:06,738
<i><b>Listen, I appreciate that, but...
I get it.</b></i>

309
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:08,356
<i><b>I shit the bed the other day.</b></i>

310
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:09,858
<i><b>Oliver.
Look, Mike.</b></i>

311
00:12:09,938 --> 00:12:12,236
<i><b>I admit, sometimes
I get flustered in court.</b></i>

312
00:12:12,357 --> 00:12:14,280
<i><b>But the law is clear on this.
It's a layup.</b></i>

313
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:17,454
<i><b>If we have a pending lawsuit, it puts
an automatic hold on the eviction.</b></i>

314
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:19,201
<i><b>I'm telling you,
I can handle this.</b></i>

315
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,328
<i><b>Please, let me make up
for the other day.</b></i>

316
00:12:23,201 --> 00:12:24,669
<i><b>Then what are you
waiting for?</b></i>

317
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:27,919
<i><b>Get your ass down to court and let
me know as soon as it's done.</b></i>

318
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:37,445
<i><b>All right, Benjamin.
Playtime's over.</b></i>

319
00:12:37,507 --> 00:12:39,180
<i><b>What the hell did you do
to my computer?</b></i>

320
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:41,887
<i><b>I didn't do anything to it, other
than increase its performance.</b></i>

321
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:43,472
<i><b>If that's your idea
of increasing performance,</b></i>

322
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:45,101
<i><b>then you ought to
rethink your career.</b></i>

323
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:46,433
<i><b>Because that thing
has crashed more times</b></i>

324
00:12:46,516 --> 00:12:49,110
<i><b>than Mel Gibson on his way
home from a Saturday night.</b></i>

325
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:51,691
<i><b>Wait a second.
Are you smiling?</b></i>

326
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:53,777
<i><b>Of course not. You're yelling at me.
Why would I be smiling?</b></i>

327
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:55,233
<i><b>Don't bullshit
a bullshitter, Benjamin.</b></i>

328
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:57,676
<i><b>You're up to something. And you
better come clean right now.</b></i>

329
00:12:58,027 --> 00:12:59,199
<i><b>Okay.</b></i>

330
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,702
<i><b>I was hoping to do this in a
more formal environment. But...</b></i>

331
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,413
<i><b>Allow me to introduce
The Donna.</b></i>

332
00:13:08,997 --> 00:13:10,169
<i><b>What the hell is that?</b></i>

333
00:13:10,373 --> 00:13:11,841
<i><b>It's a digital version
of you,</b></i>

334
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:13,793
<i><b>with approximately
10,000 of your best quotes,</b></i>

335

<i><b>witticisms and zingers packed into
five gigahertz of computing power.</b></i>

336
00:13:17,672 --> 00:13:19,470
<i><b>That's why you've been
personally updating my computer</b></i>

337
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:20,766
<i><b>and nobody else's?</b></i>

338
00:13:20,842 --> 00:13:21,809
<i><b>Yes. I've been
secretly recording you</b></i>

339
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:23,056
<i><b>for the better part
of two years.</b></i>

340
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:24,479
<i><b>Two years?</b></i>

341
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,681
<i><b>Why me?</b></i>

342
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:28,141
<i><b>Because everyone
always wishes they could</b></i>

343
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:29,521
<i><b>say the right thing
at the right time.</b></i>

344
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,680
<i><b>And you are the one woman in the universe
who says the right thing every time.</b></i>

345
00:13:32,687 --> 00:13:34,167
<i><b>Not to mention
you are without a doubt</b></i>

346
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:36,670
<i><b>the most amazing legal secretary
in the history of everything.</b></i>

347
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:40,161
<i><b>Benjamin, that's the sweetest
thing anyone's ever said to me.</b></i>

348
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:42,330
<i><b>Okay, but you said it
about yourself two weeks ago.</b></i>

349
00:13:42,405 --> 00:13:44,328
<i><b>That I did.
In that case,</b></i>

350
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:46,334
<i><b>Donna Paulsen, I wasn't
going to ask you this</b></i>

351
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:47,877
<i><b>for another few weeks,
but how would you feel</b></i>

352
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:51,001
<i><b>about pursuing this with me
as a business opportunity?</b></i>

353
00:13:52,707 --> 00:13:54,084
<i><b>Let me think about it.</b></i>

354
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:56,632
<i><b>But first, let me borrow
that thing for a few days.</b></i>

355
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:07,267
<i><b>You want to tell me
why you're playing games</b></i>

356
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:09,975
<i><b>with my associate's
admission to the Bar?</b></i>

357
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:12,352
<i><b>You're Harvey Specter.</b></i>

358
00:14:12,435 --> 00:14:13,652
<i><b>In the flesh. And if I
don't walk out of here</b></i>

359
00:14:13,728 --> 00:14:15,071
<i><b>with an appointment
in my hand,</b></i>

360
00:14:15,146 --> 00:14:16,443
<i><b>you're going to find out
what that means.</b></i>

361
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:18,945
<i><b>Because Rachel Zane
deserves to make her case.</b></i>

362
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:21,110
<i><b>Rachel Zane.</b></i>

363
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:22,787
<i><b>This is clearly
a scheduling error.</b></i>

364
00:14:22,904 --> 00:14:23,951
<i><b>I'm sorry.</b></i>

365
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:27,417
<i><b>I will, uh, set her interview
for two weeks from today.</b></i>

366
00:14:27,492 --> 00:14:30,172
<i><b>I'd say thank you, but you should
have done that in the first place.</b></i>

367
00:14:30,745 --> 00:14:32,385
<i><b>I don't think
she's going to pass, though.</b></i>

368
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:35,248
<i><b>What did you say?</b></i>

369
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:36,338
<i><b>I just thought
you should know</b></i>

370
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:38,937
<i><b>the vote has to be unanimous among
the members of the committee.</b></i>

371
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:42,966
<i><b>And I have a sense that at
least one isn't gonna say yes.</b></i>

372
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,801
<i><b>Well, you could have
just rejected her.</b></i>

373
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:47,324
<i><b>But you went to the trouble to
get me down here, so get to it.</b></i>

374
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:50,439
<i><b>Well, I'm just saying,</b></i>

375
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:54,352
<i><b>that if someone were to, say,</b></i>

376
00:14:55,478 --> 00:14:57,731
<i><b>sue my biggest competitor
for enough money</b></i>

377
00:14:57,814 --> 00:14:59,782
<i><b>so that their stock price
plummets,</b></i>

378
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:03,487
<i><b>perhaps Miss Zane's chances would
take a turn for the better.</b></i>

379
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:04,661
<i><b>Let me get this straight.</b></i>

380
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:06,205
<i><b>You're on
the Ethics Committee</b></i>

381
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,248
<i><b>and you're asking me
to do something illegal.</b></i>

382
00:15:08,366 --> 00:15:11,040
<i><b>It's not illegal if you can find
a legitimate reason to sue them.</b></i>

383
00:15:11,119 --> 00:15:12,120
<i><b>Then there's got to be
more to the story</b></i>

384
00:15:12,203 --> 00:15:13,204
<i><b>or you wouldn't be
calling me in here,</b></i>

385
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:15,130
<i><b>blackmailing me
into doing this.</b></i>

386
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:16,878
<i><b>The more to the story is,</b></i>

387
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:19,757
<i><b>you have a history of ethical ambiguity
and that's what this requires.</b></i>

388
00:15:20,211 --> 00:15:22,509
<i><b>And you're either gonna
do it or you're not.</b></i>

389
00:15:22,672 --> 00:15:24,925
<i><b>Either way, like I said,</b></i>

390
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:27,309
<i><b>Ms. Zane's interview
is in two weeks.</b></i>

391
00:15:35,518 --> 00:15:37,361
<i><b>Reckless endangerment?
Is this a joke?</b></i>

392
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:42,359
<i><b>I guarantee you
Sofia Price isn't laughing.</b></i>

393
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:44,160
<i><b>Well, any judge
in his right mind</b></i>

394
00:15:44,235 --> 00:15:45,782
<i><b>is going to laugh you
out of court</b></i>

395
00:15:45,862 --> 00:15:47,114
<i><b>because you don't
understand the law.</b></i>

396
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:49,716
<i><b>No, you're the one that doesn't
understand the law, Ms. Johnson.</b></i>

397
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:52,118
<i><b>You started demolition with
tenants still in your building.</b></i>

398
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:54,078
<i><b>You sent a 3-year-old
to the emergency room.</b></i>

399
00:15:54,162 --> 00:15:57,257
<i><b>You pursue this, I'm going
straight after the mother</b></i>

400
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:59,049
<i><b>and I'll turn her
into the negligent party</b></i>

401
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:00,877
<i><b>and she'll be lucky
to keep her son.</b></i>

402
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:01,961
<i><b>You do that
and I'll show the court</b></i>

403
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:03,967
<i><b>that you filed construction
plans with the city</b></i>

404
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:05,218
<i><b>claiming that the building
was empty.</b></i>

405
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:07,642
<i><b>Which is punishable
under the criminal code.</b></i>

406
00:16:07,717 --> 00:16:09,344
<i><b>No, Mr. Ross.</b></i>

407
00:16:09,427 --> 00:16:11,395
<i><b>You won't show them anything.</b></i>

408
00:16:11,888 --> 00:16:13,060
<i><b>He will.</b></i>

409
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:14,982
<i><b>Did you think
I wouldn't check up on you</b></i>

410
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:17,651
<i><b>when all of a sudden,
a Queens legal clinic</b></i>

411
00:16:17,727 --> 00:16:19,821
<i><b>starts acting like
a Midtown law firm?</b></i>

412
00:16:19,896 --> 00:16:21,193
<i><b>Well, I did.</b></i>

413
00:16:21,272 --> 00:16:24,776
<i><b>And if this goes to trial,
he's the one I'm up against.</b></i>

414
00:16:24,859 --> 00:16:27,408
<i><b>And we all know
what happened last time.</b></i>

415
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:29,455
<i><b>You wouldn't be here if that's
all you wanted to tell me.</b></i>

416
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,800
<i><b>So, why don't you give me a number
and I'll take it to my client?</b></i>

417
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:35,669
<i><b>Ten thousand.
Not a penny more.</b></i>

418
00:16:35,745 --> 00:16:37,543
<i><b>You see, all my experience
at a Midtown law firm</b></i>

419
00:16:37,622 --> 00:16:39,142
<i><b>tells me you're authorized
to go to 20.</b></i>

420
00:16:39,207 --> 00:16:41,255
<i><b>So, let's say 25
and call it a day.</b></i>

421
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:42,836
<i><b>$25,000?</b></i>

422
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:44,216
<i><b>Criminal charges, Linda.</b></i>

423
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:46,847
<i><b>So, if I were you,
I'd cut that check,</b></i>

424
00:16:46,923 --> 00:16:48,300
<i><b>consider it a bargain,

425

<i><b>that little boy
doesn't get worse.</b></i>

426
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:01,855
<i><b>Hey.
Any luck?</b></i>

427
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:03,781
<i><b>Depends on your definition
of the word.</b></i>

428
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:06,279
<i><b>I met with the asshole that
sent the letter to Rachel.</b></i>

429
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:08,407
<i><b>Let me guess, you couldn't convince
him to give her an interview.</b></i>

430
00:17:08,486 --> 00:17:10,113
<i><b>No, I got her the interview.</b></i>

431
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:11,698
<i><b>But the vote
has to be unanimous</b></i>

432
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:14,125
<i><b>and he's putting a price
on his vote.</b></i>

433
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:15,455
<i><b>What does he want?</b></i>

434
00:17:15,535 --> 00:17:18,135
<i><b>He wants us to fabricate a lawsuit
against his biggest competitor.</b></i>

435
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:20,206
<i><b>Jesus Christ. That's not an
ask, that's a criminal action.</b></i>

436
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:21,666
<i><b>You think
I don't know that?</b></i>

437
00:17:23,334 --> 00:17:26,178
<i><b>Okay, Harvey,
if we find a legitimate suit,</b></i>

438
00:17:26,254 --> 00:17:27,454
<i><b>it doesn't have to be illegal.</b></i>

439
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:29,306
<i><b>Which means, under the circumstances,
maybe it's worth doing.</b></i>

440
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:31,702
<i><b>I'm not doing shit until I know
the full story on this guy.</b></i>

441
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:33,344
<i><b>Harvey,
this is Rachel's future</b></i>

442
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:34,394
<i><b>we're talking about.
Yeah, I know it is.</b></i>

443
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,143
<i><b>But I'm telling you,
this isn't all he wants.</b></i>

444
00:17:36,222 --> 00:17:37,724
<i><b>And I'm not gonna
agree to anything</b></i>

445
00:17:37,807 --> 00:17:39,775
<i><b>until I know

447
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:42,649

00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:43,775
<i><b>You are.</b></i>

449
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:46,406
<i><b>I don't understand.</b></i>

450
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:47,825
<i><b>Louis, you were man enough
to admit to me</b></i>

451
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,180
<i><b>that I'm better
at fixing things.</b></i>

452
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:50,786
<i><b>Well, you're better
at something than me</b></i>

453
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:52,704
<i><b>and it's called
financial transactions.</b></i>

454
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:55,499
<i><b>I appreciate that, Harvey,
but what does that matter?</b></i>

455
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:57,418
<i><b>This guy's doing this to drive
down someone's stock price</b></i>

456
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:58,915
<i><b>and I want to know why.</b></i>

457
00:18:00,121 --> 00:18:01,293
<i><b>I'll take care of it.</b></i>

458
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:03,548
<i><b>What do we tell Rachel?</b></i>

459
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:05,380
<i><b>The truth.</b></i>

460
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:08,303
<i><b>There was a mix-up, but now
she's got a date on the books.</b></i>

461
00:18:08,379 --> 00:18:10,632
<i><b>And you and I need to
fix this before then.</b></i>

462

<i><b>Sofia.</b></i>

463
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:21,108
<i><b>How is he?
He's okay.</b></i>

464
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:23,063
<i><b>They said he should
get out in a couple of days.</b></i>

465
00:18:24,687 --> 00:18:25,939
<i><b>I have some good news.</b></i>

466
00:18:26,022 --> 00:18:27,399
<i><b>We can stay in our place?</b></i>

467

<i><b>No.</b></i>

468

00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:43,039
<i><b>Mr. Ross, I'm grateful
for everything you've done.</b></i>

471
00:18:44,999 --> 00:18:47,252
<i><b>But Marissa told me that if we
could prove what happened to A.J.</b></i>

472
00:18:47,335 --> 00:18:49,133
<i><b>is their fault,
they'd have to pay.</b></i>

473
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:51,089
<i><b>They are paying-</b></i>

474
00:18:51,172 --> 00:18:53,425
<i><b>Shouldn't they pay at least
enough for his treatment?</b></i>

475
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:58,475
<i><b>His injections next year are
gonna be 25,000 right there.</b></i>

476
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:00,898
<i><b>Sofia, going to court
is always a risk.</b></i>

477
00:19:03,434 --> 00:19:06,028
<i><b>Our lives have been
one risk after another.</b></i>

478
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:08,572
<i><b>This check isn't a risk.
This is real money.</b></i>

479
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:14,074
<i><b>How much could we get
if we win?</b></i>

480
00:19:14,737 --> 00:19:16,455
<i><b>The absolute best case?
$500,000.</b></i>

481
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:19,246
<i><b>But I'm telling you that I think...
Please, Mr. Ross.</b></i>

482
00:19:21,202 --> 00:19:22,749
<i><b>They did this to him.</b></i>

483
00:19:24,038 --> 00:19:26,712
<i><b>And if we have a chance
to change his life,</b></i>

484
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,423
<i><b>we need to take it.</b></i>

485
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:34,591
<i><b>Okay.</b></i>

486
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:43,148
<i><b>Louis, can I help you?</b></i>

487
00:19:45,643 --> 00:19:48,692
<i><b>I was just thinking about
when I stood here years ago</b></i>

488
00:19:48,771 --> 00:19:51,775
<i><b>and I had to tell you that you
weren't going to get into Harvard.</b></i>

489
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:53,700
<i><b>And you thought
you'd never be a lawyer.</b></i>

490
00:19:54,068 --> 00:19:56,571
<i><b>But I knew you'd find a way.</b></i>

491
00:19:57,363 --> 00:19:58,990
<i><b>You got me my interview.</b></i>

492
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,457
<i><b>I did.</b></i>

493
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:03,787
<i><b>Turns out</b></i>

494
00:20:04,787 --> 00:20:06,881
<i><b>it was just a mix-up.</b></i>

495
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:10,755
<i><b>Thank you, Louis.</b></i>

496
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:14,509
<i><b>Do you think</b></i>

497
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:18,009
<i><b>I'm still gonna have to defend myself
about my relationship with Mike?</b></i>

498
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:19,886
<i><b>I don't know, Rachel.</b></i>

499
00:20:21,137 --> 00:20:22,514
<i><b>But I do know we're gonna
do whatever it takes</b></i>

500
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:24,439
<i><b>to make sure
you become a lawyer.</b></i>

501
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:49,423
<i><b>I'm seeing someone.</b></i>

502
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,878
<i><b>These aren't for you.
They're for my fianc√©e.</b></i>

503
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,079
<i><b>But if it gets you to close
this deal, you can keep 'em</b></i>

504
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:57,610
<i><b>and I'll just buy her
another bouquet.</b></i>

505
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,467
<i><b>I already closed this deal.</b></i>

506
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:01,268
<i><b>Turns out you didn't.
That is bad faith.</b></i>

507
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:02,595
<i><b>Circumstances changed.</b></i>

508
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:04,931
<i><b>What the hell changed
between today and tonight?</b></i>

509
00:21:05,014 --> 00:21:07,517
<i><b>My client found out that her
son needs more treatment,</b></i>

510
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,772
<i><b>which means
she needs more money.</b></i>

511
00:21:08,851 --> 00:21:11,320
<i><b>I think what happened is your
client's seeing an opportunity</b></i>

512
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:14,023
<i><b>for a bigger payday
and you can't control her.</b></i>

513
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:15,949
<i><b>Well, what you think
doesn't really matter.</b></i>

514
00:21:16,025 --> 00:21:19,450
<i><b>Because if you don't raise your offer
to $100,000, we're going to court.</b></i>

515
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:21,030
<i><b>Are you out of your mind?</b></i>

516
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:23,582
<i><b>This isn't Wall Street. We don't
give out that kind of money.</b></i>

517
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:24,704
<i><b>If you lose, you're
going to be giving out</b></i>

518
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:25,984
<i><b>a hell of a lot
more than that.</b></i>

519
00:21:26,035 --> 00:21:29,539
<i><b>And if I agree to this, you'll be right
back here tomorrow asking for more.</b></i>

520
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,337
<i><b>Look, I'm telling you.</b></i>

521
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,335
<i><b>I can get her
to agree to this.</b></i>

522
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:35,965
<i><b>And I am telling you.</b></i>

523
00:21:36,045 --> 00:21:38,139
<i><b>You've had your offer.
That's all you're gonna get.</b></i>

524
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:40,308
<i><b>And if you don't take it right
now, we're going to trial</b></i>

525
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:43,101
<i><b>and I am going to wipe
the floor with this kid.</b></i>

526
00:21:43,219 --> 00:21:45,142
<i><b>I wouldn't be so sure about that.
Listen to me.</b></i>

527
00:21:45,221 --> 00:21:47,394
<i><b>If you think you're gonna
pull some kind of trick</b></i>

528
00:21:47,473 --> 00:21:51,319
<i><b>to get you to be able to sit
next to him and hold his hand,</b></i>

529
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:53,361
<i><b>there's no way
that's gonna happen.</b></i>

530
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:54,905
<i><b>Because you were
deemed a fraud.</b></i>

531
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:58,826
<i><b>And no judge in the world is going to
let you turn his court into a joke.</b></i>

532
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:07,876
<i><b>Jesus Christ.</b></i>

533
00:22:07,952 --> 00:22:09,152
<i><b>Harvey's handwriting
is so bad,</b></i>

534
00:22:09,203 --> 00:22:11,376
<i><b>he makes my doctor
look like a calligrapher.</b></i>

535
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:12,581
<i><b>You're telling me, sister.</b></i>

536
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:15,635
<i><b>That handwriting's sloppier than
Mel Gibson on a Saturday night.</b></i>

537
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:18,929
<i><b>Holy shit, you can adjust my
phrases to the situation at hand?</b></i>

538
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:21,302
<i><b>Of course I can. Who
do you think you're dealing with?</b></i>

539
00:22:21,382 --> 00:22:22,383
<i><b>As a matter of fact,</b></i>

540
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:25,015
<i><b>I just incorporated "holy shit"
into my vocabulary right now.</b></i>

541
00:22:25,094 --> 00:22:26,846
<i><b>No way. That had to
have already been in there.</b></i>

542
00:22:26,929 --> 00:22:28,602
<i><b>Well, look who finally
showed up to the party.</b></i>

543
00:22:28,681 --> 00:22:32,185
<i><b>The party written by, produced
by and starring The Donna.</b></i>

544
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:34,027
<i><b>I like the way you think.</b></i>

545
00:22:34,103 --> 00:22:35,855
<i><b>Of course you do.
I'm you.</b></i>

546
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:37,318
<i><b>And you know what you are?</b></i>

547
00:22:37,398 --> 00:22:38,650
<i><b>Awesome.
Awesome.</b></i>

548
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:40,450
<i><b>Hey.</b></i>

549
00:22:40,818 --> 00:22:41,944
<i><b>Want to take
a coffee break?</b></i>

550
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:43,153
<i><b>I think we've earned it.</b></i>

551
00:22:43,237 --> 00:22:44,534
<i><b>Yeah. Me, too.</b></i>

552
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:46,331
<i><b>And none of that Keurig
shit that Gretchen likes.</b></i>

553
00:22:46,407 --> 00:22:48,205
<i><b>Fresh brewed or nothing.</b></i>

554
00:22:48,284 --> 00:22:50,787
<i><b>When did you get so sassy?</b></i>

555
00:22:54,248 --> 00:22:55,465
<i><b>Harvey, good, you're here.</b></i>

556
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:57,859
<i><b>I got your message. Did you find something?</b></i>

557
00:22:58,127 --> 00:22:59,299
<i><b>You tell me.</b></i>

558
00:23:03,257 --> 00:23:05,430
<i><b>Explains a lot, doesn't it?
It does.</b></i>

559
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:08,346
<i><b>Good work. I'll take it from here.
Wait. Where are you going?</b></i>

560
00:23:08,429 --> 00:23:11,399
<i><b>Where do you think I'm going? I'm going
to see that asshole and set him straight.</b></i>

561
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:12,725
<i><b>But I ordered you a sandwich.
Turkey, no mayo,</b></i>

562
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:14,151
<i><b>extra pickles,
like you like it.</b></i>

563
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:16,026
<i><b>Do you want me to
fix Rachel's problem or not?</b></i>

564
00:23:16,145 --> 00:23:17,897
<i><b>I do. It's just...</b></i>

565
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:20,066
<i><b>I thought we could talk.</b></i>

566
00:23:20,149 --> 00:23:21,492
<i><b>What do you mean, talk?</b></i>

567
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:23,402
<i><b>Harvey, please. I need to
talk to you man to man.</b></i>

568
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:24,828
<i><b>It's not about business.</b></i>

569
00:23:25,988 --> 00:23:27,661
<i><b>Did you really
get me extra pickles?</b></i>

570
00:23:28,324 --> 00:23:29,884
<i><b>Donna once told me
that's what you like.</b></i>

571
00:23:32,286 --> 00:23:33,503
<i><b>Okay, Louis.</b></i>

572
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:35,172
<i><b>I've got a few minutes.</b></i>

573
00:23:39,001 --> 00:23:41,129
<i><b>You really can tell if
it's fresh brewed or not?</b></i>

574
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:43,134
<i><b>Please, this
isn't my first rodeo.</b></i>

575
00:23:43,213 --> 00:23:45,011
<i><b>You're telling me.</b></i>

576
00:23:45,925 --> 00:23:47,598
<i><b>Donna, can I talk
to you for a second?</b></i>

577
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:49,957
<i><b>Of course you can.
What do you need, Hot Pants?</b></i>

578
00:23:50,179 --> 00:23:52,022
<i><b>What... What is that?</b></i>

579
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:54,976
<i><b>It's a device called The Donna
that Benjamin's working on.</b></i>

580
00:23:55,059 --> 00:23:56,185
<i><b>And it's awesome.</b></i>

581
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:57,861
<i><b>Go ahead,
ask it something.</b></i>

582
00:23:57,937 --> 00:23:59,109
<i><b>I don't want
to ask it something.</b></i>

583
00:23:59,188 --> 00:24:00,610
<i><b>I want to ask you something.</b></i>

584
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:02,236
<i><b>No, that's the whole point.
It is me.</b></i>

585
00:24:02,316 --> 00:24:03,863
<i><b>If by you, you
mean much better than you.</b></i>

586
00:24:03,943 --> 00:24:05,490
<i><b>See?
What did I tell you?</b></i>

587
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:06,912
<i><b>Donna, I'm serious.</b></i>

588
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,077
<i><b>Look, this is
a really cute joke,</b></i>

589
00:24:09,156 --> 00:24:11,454
<i><b>but can I please just have a
conversation with my friend?</b></i>

590
00:24:11,533 --> 00:24:12,933
<i><b>If by friend, you mean...</b></i>

591
00:24:14,828 --> 00:24:16,501
<i><b>Of course you can, Rachel.</b></i>

592
00:24:17,373 --> 00:24:18,374
<i><b>What do you need?</b></i>

593
00:24:20,751 --> 00:24:22,219
<i><b>So, let me
get this straight.</b></i>

594
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:24,968
<i><b>You're in love with a woman that
you've known for about 10 minutes,</b></i>

595
00:24:25,047 --> 00:24:27,470
<i><b>she's having
another man's baby,</b></i>

596
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:29,802
<i><b>and yet you're gonna marry her
and raise it as your own.</b></i>

597
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:31,228
<i><b>In a nutshell.</b></i>

598
00:24:31,345 --> 00:24:33,723
<i><b>And what exactly do you want from me?
I need your advice.</b></i>

599
00:24:33,806 --> 00:24:35,149
<i><b>The guy's gonna be
at the sonogram tomorrow</b></i>

600
00:24:35,224 --> 00:24:36,851
<i><b>and I'm afraid
I may cause a scene.</b></i>

601
00:24:36,934 --> 00:24:38,732
<i><b>Louis, I don't understand
what you're coming to me for.</b></i>

602
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:41,030
<i><b>What do I know about...
Here. This is why.</b></i>

603
00:24:42,231 --> 00:24:45,235
<i><b>Yeah. You get it? This is
why I'm coming to you.</b></i>

604
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:47,487
<i><b>Oh. He's good-looking.</b></i>

605
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:50,664
<i><b>He's not just good-looking, he's
a goddamn Renaissance statue.</b></i>

606
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:52,582
<i><b>And I need to know
what he's thinking.</b></i>

607
00:24:52,658 --> 00:24:54,752
<i><b>Louis, I don't speak
for all handsome men.</b></i>

608
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:56,412
<i><b>What do you see
when you look at me?</b></i>

609
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:57,496
<i><b>What?</b></i>

610
00:24:57,579 --> 00:24:59,047
<i><b>I want to know what you see
when you look at me.</b></i>

611
00:24:59,123 --> 00:25:02,003
<i><b>Right now. Be honest. Say the first
three things that pop into your head.</b></i>

612
00:25:02,084 --> 00:25:03,256
<i><b>Teeth. Nose. Teeth.</b></i>

613
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:05,178
<i><b>God damn it. Be serious.</b></i>

614
00:25:05,254 --> 00:25:07,097
<i><b>I am being serious.
Well, you know what?</b></i>

615
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:11,010
<i><b>Never mind.
I shouldn't have come to you.</b></i>

616
00:25:11,093 --> 00:25:12,493
<i><b>Louis, it doesn't matter
what I see.</b></i>

617
00:25:12,553 --> 00:25:14,146
<i><b>What matters is
what this woman sees.</b></i>

618
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:17,395
<i><b>And she obviously sees something
or she wouldn't be with you.</b></i>

619
00:25:17,975 --> 00:25:19,192
<i><b>She'd be with him.</b></i>

620
00:25:19,268 --> 00:25:20,508
<i><b>Look.
I appreciate that, Harvey.</b></i>

621
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:22,738
<i><b>But you know me. I'm going to
be in the same room as him</b></i>

622
00:25:22,813 --> 00:25:24,986
<i><b>looking at an image
of what he made with her.</b></i>

623
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:26,738
<i><b>How do I not lose my shit?</b></i>

624
00:25:27,484 --> 00:25:29,236
<i><b>You're right, it is his baby.</b></i>

625
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:30,954
<i><b>But it's yours, too.</b></i>

626
00:25:31,155 --> 00:25:35,080
<i><b>And you're gonna want it to have
as much love as it possibly can.</b></i>

627
00:25:35,576 --> 00:25:39,001
<i><b>And that means having a good
relationship with its father.</b></i>

628
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:41,548
<i><b>Because there's nothing
more important than family.</b></i>

629
00:25:43,125 --> 00:25:44,126
<i><b>You're right.</b></i>

630
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:45,631
<i><b>Thank you, Harvey.</b></i>

631
00:25:50,132 --> 00:25:51,304
<i><b>Hey, Mike.</b></i>

632
00:25:51,842 --> 00:25:53,219
<i><b>How's it going out there?</b></i>

633
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:54,803
<i><b>What can I do for you?</b></i>

634
00:25:55,304 --> 00:25:56,897
<i><b>I want you
to take a look at this.</b></i>

635
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:00,688
<i><b>Let me get this straight.</b></i>

636
00:26:00,768 --> 00:26:02,896
<i><b>You want Oliver
to petition the court</b></i>

637
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:04,605
<i><b>to let Marissa
argue his case.</b></i>

638
00:26:04,688 --> 00:26:05,780
<i><b>Yes, I do.</b></i>

639
00:26:06,148 --> 00:26:08,401
<i><b>Well, that's not going to happen.
Why not?</b></i>

640
00:26:08,484 --> 00:26:09,451
<i><b>Because
he's a full-fledged attorney</b></i>

641
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:10,652
<i><b>and she's
a third-year law student.</b></i>

642
00:26:10,736 --> 00:26:11,828
<i><b>He gets flustered in court.</b></i>

643
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:13,322
<i><b>And she's never even been to court.
I'm telling you,</b></i>

644
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:15,123
<i><b>I don't think that he can handle this.
She can.</b></i>

645
00:26:15,199 --> 00:26:16,746
<i><b>And this woman's future
is on the line.</b></i>

646
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:18,418
<i><b>Then convince her
to take the deal.</b></i>

647
00:26:18,494 --> 00:26:20,087
<i><b>She doesn't want the deal.</b></i>

648
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:23,583
<i><b>You're putting me in a
hell of a spot here, Mike.</b></i>

649
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:26,593
<i><b>Nathan,
you hired me for a reason.</b></i>

650
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:28,970
<i><b>You told me to run the
associates and I'm running them.</b></i>

651
00:26:29,046 --> 00:26:30,844
<i><b>Now, are you gonna
let me do that or not?</b></i>

652
00:26:32,508 --> 00:26:34,181
<i><b>You're gonna do it, do it.</b></i>

653
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:36,182
<i><b>But you're gonna be
the one to tell Oliver.</b></i>

654
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:49,445
<i><b>You wanted to see me?</b></i>

655
00:26:50,943 --> 00:26:52,945
<i><b>Yeah. I, uh...
I did. Come in.</b></i>

656
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:55,622
<i><b>I want to talk to you about
the, uh, Sofia Price case.</b></i>

657
00:26:55,697 --> 00:26:56,949
<i><b>Great, because I actually
wanted to tell you</b></i>

658
00:26:57,032 --> 00:27:00,457
<i><b>about five similar cases in New
Jersey that won huge settlements.</b></i>

659
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:04,623
<i><b>That's good work,
and we can use that.</b></i>

660
00:27:04,915 --> 00:27:07,213
<i><b>But listen, I need you
to do something for me.</b></i>

661
00:27:13,382 --> 00:27:15,055
<i><b>You want Marissa
to be first chair.</b></i>

662
00:27:15,551 --> 00:27:16,848
<i><b>I think it's for the best.</b></i>

663
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:20,647
<i><b>Mike, I know why you think this is
the right choice, but I can do this.</b></i>

664
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:22,599
<i><b>I'm sorry, Oliver. But at
this point in your career,</b></i>

665
00:27:22,683 --> 00:27:23,900
<i><b>I don't think you can.</b></i>

666
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:26,278
<i><b>Mike.
Oliver, you said it yourself.</b></i>

667
00:27:26,353 --> 00:27:28,447
<i><b>You get flustered in court.
I know that.</b></i>

668
00:27:28,522 --> 00:27:30,149
<i><b>But if I'm going
to be a real lawyer,</b></i>

669
00:27:30,232 --> 00:27:31,199
<i><b>I have to get better
in trial.</b></i>

670
00:27:31,275 --> 00:27:33,475
<i><b>And the only way to do that
is to get back on the horse.</b></i>

671
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:35,988
<i><b>And I'm telling you that when the
right case comes along, I promise</b></i>

672
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:38,369
<i><b>I will let you do that.
But this is not the case.</b></i>

673
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:42,286
<i><b>This one is Marissa's and I
need to know you have her back.</b></i>

674
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:44,959
<i><b>I do.</b></i>

675
00:27:45,998 --> 00:27:46,999
<i><b>Good.</b></i>

676
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:49,842
<i><b>I'll go tell her.</b></i>

677
00:27:50,711 --> 00:27:52,258
<i><b>You don't have
to do that, Oliver.</b></i>

678
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:54,257
<i><b>Yes, I do.</b></i>

679
00:27:55,174 --> 00:27:57,774
<i><b>It's better for the clinic if she
thinks I have confidence in her,</b></i>

680
00:27:58,093 --> 00:27:59,936
<i><b>not that you don't have
confidence in me.</b></i>

681
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:13,988
<i><b>You're back.</b></i>

682
00:28:14,067 --> 00:28:15,147
<i><b>You better believe
I'm back.</b></i>

683
00:28:15,152 --> 00:28:17,672
<i><b>Because I looked into what you're
doing and why you're doing it.</b></i>

684
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:19,198
<i><b>There's really not much
to find, Mr. Specter.</b></i>

685
00:28:19,281 --> 00:28:20,874
<i><b>Let me lay it out for you.</b></i>

686
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:23,122
<i><b>Velocity Data Solutions
stole your technology</b></i>

687
00:28:23,202 --> 00:28:25,000
<i><b>and they're rushing it
to market.</b></i>

688
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:28,002
<i><b>So, you want to orchestrate a
takeover and get back what's yours.</b></i>

689
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:29,298
<i><b>That sound about right?</b></i>

690
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:33,879
<i><b>My company is gonna go under
because of what they did.</b></i>

691
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:35,722
<i><b>People are gonna
lose their jobs.</b></i>

692
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:36,798
<i><b>Then go to the FBI.</b></i>

693
00:28:36,882 --> 00:28:37,929
<i><b>I can't.
Why not?</b></i>

694
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:40,473
<i><b>Because I can't. Yeah, I'll
tell you why you can't.</b></i>

695
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:44,477
<i><b>Because a squeaky clean guy like
you doesn't come to a guy like me</b></i>

696
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:46,308
<i><b>unless he's got no choice.</b></i>

697
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:49,520
<i><b>And you need me a hell of a
lot more than I need you.</b></i>

698
00:28:49,603 --> 00:28:50,729
<i><b>So, why don't you give me
a call when you're ready</b></i>

699
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:51,904
<i><b>to tell the truth?</b></i>

700
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:58,078
<i><b>They got it from me.</b></i>

701
00:28:58,946 --> 00:29:00,118
<i><b>I'm listening.</b></i>

702
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:02,161
<i><b>I had an affair.</b></i>

703
00:29:03,116 --> 00:29:05,244
<i><b>I was stupid and careless,</b></i>

704
00:29:05,327 --> 00:29:07,170
<i><b>and she got access
to my laptop.</b></i>

705
00:29:07,246 --> 00:29:09,624
<i><b>And you're married and your
wife can't find out about it.</b></i>

706
00:29:09,706 --> 00:29:11,674
<i><b>And that's why
you can't go to the FBI.</b></i>

707
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,252
<i><b>There. Now you know.</b></i>

708
00:29:13,335 --> 00:29:17,215
<i><b>What I know is Rachel Zane
deserves to be in the Bar.</b></i>

709
00:29:17,339 --> 00:29:19,558
<i><b>So, you're not only
gonna stop blocking her,</b></i>

710
00:29:19,633 --> 00:29:22,227
<i><b>you're going to run interference
for her if someone else does.</b></i>

711
00:29:22,344 --> 00:29:24,221
<i><b>I don't have the power to do that.
Bullshit.</b></i>

712
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:25,681
<i><b>You had the power to stop it.
You better believe</b></i>

713
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:27,766
<i><b>that you can turn it
in the other direction.</b></i>

714
00:29:28,976 --> 00:29:30,978
<i><b>And in return,
you'll do what I want.</b></i>

715
00:29:31,395 --> 00:29:32,521
<i><b>No.</b></i>

716
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:35,232
<i><b>You're gonna do it because
it's the right thing to do.</b></i>

717
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:39,820
<i><b>But I'll do what you want
for something else.</b></i>

718
00:29:45,409 --> 00:29:46,535
<i><b>I need to talk to you.</b></i>

719
00:29:49,288 --> 00:29:50,289
<i><b>What's going on?</b></i>

720
00:29:50,372 --> 00:29:53,046
<i><b>Oliver just gave me all
the case files for Sofia.</b></i>

721
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:55,378
<i><b>He said I'm the one
who should bring this home.</b></i>

722
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:58,388
<i><b>Yeah, I know.</b></i>

723
00:29:58,964 --> 00:30:01,137
<i><b>We talked about it
and I agree with him.</b></i>

724
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:02,934
<i><b>Mike, I know
this wasn't Oliver's idea.</b></i>

725
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:05,604
<i><b>It was yours, because you
don't think he's ready.</b></i>

726
00:30:05,846 --> 00:30:07,564
<i><b>Which is why
I'm coming to you.</b></i>

727
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:09,357
<i><b>Marissa,
you can handle this.</b></i>

728
00:30:09,433 --> 00:30:10,810
<i><b>I know I can.</b></i>

729
00:30:10,892 --> 00:30:13,020
<i><b>But the problem is,
I can't do it.</b></i>

730
00:30:14,104 --> 00:30:15,356
<i><b>What are you talking about?</b></i>

731
00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:19,943
<i><b>Um...</b></i>

732
00:30:20,027 --> 00:30:21,779
<i><b>My father's been sick.</b></i>

733
00:30:22,154 --> 00:30:25,033
<i><b>And I haven't talked about it
because I don't like to...</b></i>

734
00:30:25,449 --> 00:30:28,453
<i><b>But now, he needs surgery</b></i>

735
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,628
<i><b>and I put in for the
time off weeks ago.</b></i>

736
00:30:30,704 --> 00:30:32,377
<i><b>And I have to
be there for him.</b></i>

737
00:30:32,456 --> 00:30:33,878
<i><b>But now that
I'm telling you this,</b></i>

738
00:30:33,957 --> 00:30:35,709
<i><b>I'm thinking maybe I could
fly back a few days early</b></i>

739
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:38,383
<i><b>or I could get there a day later...
Stop. Stop. Stop.</b></i>

740
00:30:40,756 --> 00:30:41,848
<i><b>It's okay.</b></i>

741
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:45,177
<i><b>I want to help Sofia, Mike.
I know you do.</b></i>

742
00:30:45,761 --> 00:30:47,559
<i><b>But you need to be
with your father.</b></i>

743
00:30:50,307 --> 00:30:51,524
<i><b>What are you going to do?</b></i>

744
00:30:52,017 --> 00:30:53,439
<i><b>I'll figure something out.</b></i>

745
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:09,117
<i><b>Donna, hey.</b></i>

746
00:31:09,201 --> 00:31:11,203
<i><b>How did you like the...
It's a no.</b></i>

747
00:31:11,828 --> 00:31:13,705
<i><b>What do you mean, it's a no?</b></i>

748
00:31:13,789 --> 00:31:15,883
<i><b>I mean, it's a cute joke,</b></i>

749
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:19,052
<i><b>but I'm not interested in pursuing
it as a business opportunity.</b></i>

750
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:21,129
<i><b>I don't understand.
I thought you liked the idea.</b></i>

751
00:31:21,213 --> 00:31:22,214
<i><b>I did.</b></i>

752
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:24,846
<i><b>But that was before
I realized that it was nothing</b></i>

753
00:31:24,925 --> 00:31:27,053
<i><b>but quippy lines
and sassy remarks.</b></i>

754
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:28,762
<i><b>But that's who you are.</b></i>

755
00:31:28,845 --> 00:31:30,267
<i><b>No, Benjamin.</b></i>

756
00:31:30,472 --> 00:31:32,600
<i><b>That's part of who I am. And it's
the only part you've ever seen.</b></i>

757
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:34,935
<i><b>But that's because we don't
really know each other.</b></i>

758
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:38,238
<i><b>But if we did, you'd know that
what really makes me special</b></i>

759
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:42,693
<i><b>is my intuition and my
empathy and my heart.</b></i>

760
00:31:43,527 --> 00:31:45,495
<i><b>And this doesn't have
any of that. So...</b></i>

761
00:31:46,613 --> 00:31:49,241
<i><b>I'm sorry, but it's a no.</b></i>

762
00:31:50,283 --> 00:31:51,500
<i><b>Uh...</b></i>

763
00:31:57,457 --> 00:31:58,458
<i><b>Hey, Mike.</b></i>

764
00:31:58,542 --> 00:32:00,840
<i><b>I'd love to chat right now,
but I can't.</b></i>

765
00:32:01,253 --> 00:32:02,800
<i><b>I'm actually going
to a movie for a change.</b></i>

766
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:04,381
<i><b>Yeah, I just need a second.</b></i>

767
00:32:05,006 --> 00:32:06,053
<i><b>What's up?</b></i>

768
00:32:07,843 --> 00:32:09,971
<i><b>I need you to argue
the Price case tomorrow.</b></i>

769
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:11,888
<i><b>What did you just ask me?</b></i>

770
00:32:11,972 --> 00:32:13,394
<i><b>Because it sounded like you
want me to take the case</b></i>

771
00:32:13,473 --> 00:32:15,271
<i><b>that you begged me
to give to Marissa.</b></i>

772
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:18,445
<i><b>I did give it to her, but you didn't
tell me that her father had surgery.</b></i>

773
00:32:18,854 --> 00:32:20,902
<i><b>Because I didn't know
her father had surgery.</b></i>

774
00:32:21,523 --> 00:32:22,740
<i><b>She put in for it.</b></i>

775
00:32:22,983 --> 00:32:24,075
<i><b>And I don't pay attention
to that shit.</b></i>

776
00:32:24,151 --> 00:32:25,528
<i><b>Give it back to Oliver.</b></i>

777
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:27,078
<i><b>I told you, he'll lose.</b></i>

778
00:32:27,154 --> 00:32:29,953
<i><b>Then he'll lose. Now, I'm
sorry, but I have to go.</b></i>

779
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:31,078
<i><b>God damn it.
This is a woman's life</b></i>

780
00:32:31,158 --> 00:32:32,205
<i><b>and you're going
to a goddamn movie?</b></i>

781
00:32:32,284 --> 00:32:33,661
<i><b>What the hell
is wrong with you?</b></i>

782
00:32:34,286 --> 00:32:35,503
<i><b>Are you...</b></i>

783
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:38,173
<i><b>Listen.
We work in a clinic.</b></i>

784
00:32:38,248 --> 00:32:40,421
<i><b>Every one of our clients'
lives is hanging by a thread</b></i>

785
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,220
<i><b>and if they lose,
they're out on the street,</b></i>

786
00:32:42,294 --> 00:32:44,467
<i><b>they don't get the surgery
or they get deported.</b></i>

787
00:32:44,546 --> 00:32:47,265
<i><b>That's life. And I haven't
had a life in five years.</b></i>

788
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,842
<i><b>Which is why I hired you.</b></i>

789
00:32:48,925 --> 00:32:51,019
<i><b>So, don't you ever
say that to me again.</b></i>

790
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:55,682
<i><b>Look.</b></i>

791
00:32:55,765 --> 00:32:57,187
<i><b>Oliver is the kind
of lawyer we get here.</b></i>

792
00:32:57,267 --> 00:32:59,565
<i><b>If he can't handle it,
he can't handle it.</b></i>

793
00:33:00,353 --> 00:33:01,696
<i><b>That's how it goes.</b></i>

794
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:04,917
<i><b>Then I want to petition the court
to sit at the table with him.</b></i>

795
00:33:05,859 --> 00:33:06,860
<i><b>No.</b></i>

796
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:09,154
<i><b>We can ask for a special
exemption and I...</b></i>

797
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:10,989
<i><b>And I said no. You're not
an officer of the court,</b></i>

798
00:33:11,072 --> 00:33:13,450
<i><b>they will not grant it, and
that is not your place here.</b></i>

799
00:33:13,575 --> 00:33:16,015
<i><b>Then at least I can sit near him and...
You hear me right now.</b></i>

800
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:18,246
<i><b>I gave you a chance
because I needed it.</b></i>

801
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:22,176
<i><b>But if you risk the reputation of
this clinic over one housing case,</b></i>

802
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:23,923
<i><b>I will fire you
and make sure</b></i>

803
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:27,256
<i><b>that you are banned from ever
setting foot in a courtroom again.</b></i>

804
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:29,595
<i><b>Is that clear?</b></i>

805
00:33:32,052 --> 00:33:34,100
<i><b>Is that clear?
Yes.</b></i>

806
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:36,188
<i><b>It's clear.</b></i>

807
00:33:44,189 --> 00:33:45,862
<i><b>This is a nice place
you got here.</b></i>

808
00:33:45,941 --> 00:33:47,113
<i><b>When are they condemning it?</b></i>

809
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:49,699
<i><b>What are you doing here, Harvey?
I need to talk to you.</b></i>

810
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:52,538
<i><b>Look, now's not a good time.
I've got to figure out how to...</b></i>

811
00:33:52,614 --> 00:33:56,960
<i><b>What if I told you I have a
way to get you into the Bar?</b></i>

812
00:33:57,452 --> 00:33:58,453
<i><b>What?</b></i>

813
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:00,807
<i><b>Someone came to us
trying to play games</b></i>

814
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:03,424
<i><b>with Rachel's character
and fitness interview and...</b></i>

815
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:05,423
<i><b>Wait, what? What the hell
are you talking about?</b></i>

816
00:34:05,502 --> 00:34:06,879
<i><b>Relax, I handled it.</b></i>

817
00:34:06,962 --> 00:34:08,885
<i><b>But now, we have
a chance to get you in.</b></i>

818
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:11,762
<i><b>What's the catch?</b></i>

819
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:14,010
<i><b>Mike.</b></i>

820
00:34:14,094 --> 00:34:16,347
<i><b>Harvey, there are no free lunches.
What's the catch?</b></i>

821
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:19,780
<i><b>We need to come up with a lawsuit
against Velocity Data Solutions,</b></i>

822
00:34:19,849 --> 00:34:21,529
<i><b>to drive their stock price down.</b></i>

823
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,187
<i><b>Are you kidding me? No.</b></i>

824
00:34:23,687 --> 00:34:24,813
<i><b>What do you mean, no?</b></i>

825
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:26,239
<i><b>What's wrong with you?
What's wrong with me</b></i>

826
00:34:26,314 --> 00:34:28,191
<i><b>is I don't particularly feel
like going back to prison.</b></i>

827
00:34:28,275 --> 00:34:32,155
<i><b>And the last time I checked, fabricating a
lawsuit to manipulate a stock is illegal.</b></i>

828
00:34:32,237 --> 00:34:34,160
<i><b>It's not illegal
if we find a legitimate suit.</b></i>

829
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:37,243
<i><b>Ah, this is such bullshit. We would
just be telling ourselves that.</b></i>

830
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:39,874
<i><b>Just like we told ourselves we
weren't colluding with Cahill.</b></i>

831
00:34:39,953 --> 00:34:40,954
<i><b>And that got you
out of prison.</b></i>

832
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:43,415
<i><b>So, let's finish the job and get
you back to being a lawyer.</b></i>

833
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:45,298
<i><b>Harvey, I'm more a lawyer
now than I ever was.</b></i>

834
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:47,711
<i><b>Oh, bullshit. You're a
babysitter and you know it.</b></i>

835
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:49,967
<i><b>Hey, I'm doing what I wanted
and I'm helping people.</b></i>

836
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:52,286
<i><b>So, you want to call me a
babysitter, you go right ahead.</b></i>

837
00:34:52,299 --> 00:34:54,552
<i><b>But right now, the house is on
fire, the kids are in the bedroom</b></i>

838
00:34:54,634 --> 00:34:56,227
<i><b>and I'm about
to goddamn save them.</b></i>

839
00:34:56,303 --> 00:34:59,182
<i><b>Mike, we have
an opportunity right now.</b></i>

840
00:34:59,264 --> 00:35:01,266
<i><b>It's not gonna
present itself again.</b></i>

841
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:02,851
<i><b>I appreciate that, Harvey.</b></i>

842
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:04,482
<i><b>I do.</b></i>

843
00:35:05,687 --> 00:35:07,689
<i><b>But I'm telling you,
my answer is no.</b></i>

844
00:35:16,489 --> 00:35:18,116
<i><b>Hey.
What's going on?</b></i>

845
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:19,951
<i><b>What's the emergency?
Where's Marissa?</b></i>

846
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:22,253
<i><b>Marissa's gone.</b></i>

847
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:24,422
<i><b>What do you mean, gone?</b></i>

848
00:35:24,873 --> 00:35:26,716
<i><b>I mean that
you're first chair tomorrow,</b></i>

849
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:28,551
<i><b>and we need to get you ready.</b></i>

850
00:35:28,752 --> 00:35:29,878
<i><b>What?</b></i>

851
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:31,630
<i><b>Oliver, it's not a big deal.</b></i>

852
00:35:31,713 --> 00:35:34,193
<i><b>Not a big deal? We can't risk
having me mess up in court again.</b></i>

853
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:35,839
<i><b>This case
is too important.</b></i>

854
00:35:35,884 --> 00:35:37,477
<i><b>You know how I know that?
Because you told me.</b></i>

855
00:35:37,552 --> 00:35:38,974
<i><b>I know what I said.</b></i>

856
00:35:40,055 --> 00:35:42,023
<i><b>But we don't have time
to find anyone else.</b></i>

857
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:44,567
<i><b>The trial's tomorrow. Now, are
we gonna do this thing or not?</b></i>

858
00:35:49,731 --> 00:35:51,825
<i><b>It happened
at my first mock trial.</b></i>

859
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:54,782
<i><b>I was so prepared.</b></i>

860
00:35:55,862 --> 00:35:59,207
<i><b>And then the trial started and the
other side threw a wrinkle in.</b></i>

861
00:35:59,282 --> 00:36:01,455
<i><b>And I thought
I could think on my feet.</b></i>

862
00:36:01,868 --> 00:36:04,337
<i><b>But all of a sudden,
I felt everyone watching me.</b></i>

863
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:07,916
<i><b>And my mouth went dry
and my mind went blank</b></i>

864
00:36:08,541 --> 00:36:09,758
<i><b>and I froze.</b></i>

865
00:36:09,918 --> 00:36:11,044
<i><b>Oliver,</b></i>

866
00:36:11,878 --> 00:36:13,596
<i><b>we can get through this
together.</b></i>

867
00:36:13,672 --> 00:36:15,766
<i><b>Except now you told me
I can't handle it.</b></i>

868
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:18,347
<i><b>And that's going to be
boring a hole in my brain,</b></i>

869
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:20,144
<i><b>making this thing
1,000 times harder.</b></i>

870
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:22,188
<i><b>Well, I can't take back
what I said.</b></i>

871
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:24,849
<i><b>But what I can do
is stay here all night</b></i>

872
00:36:24,933 --> 00:36:27,027
<i><b>to make sure
you prove me wrong.</b></i>

873
00:36:31,064 --> 00:36:32,111
<i><b>I don't know.</b></i>

874
00:36:32,649 --> 00:36:33,866
<i><b>Yes, you do.</b></i>

875
00:36:36,111 --> 00:36:37,283
<i><b>I want you to say it.</b></i>

876
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:41,867
<i><b>We're gonna win this.</b></i>

877
00:36:42,534 --> 00:36:44,002
<i><b>We're going to win this.</b></i>

878
00:36:44,077 --> 00:36:45,374
<i><b>Say it again.</b></i>

879
00:36:45,704 --> 00:36:47,547
<i><b>We're going to win this.</b></i>

880
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:49,044
<i><b>One more time.</b></i>

881
00:36:50,125 --> 00:36:51,672
<i><b>But this time, mean it.</b></i>

882
00:36:52,377 --> 00:36:54,300
<i><b>We are going to win this.</b></i>

883
00:36:56,464 --> 00:36:58,842
<i><b>Now, the first thing they're going
to do is file a motion to dismiss.</b></i>

884
00:36:58,925 --> 00:37:00,302
<i><b>Actually, they already did.</b></i>

885
00:37:03,138 --> 00:37:04,390
<i><b>Good.</b></i>

886
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:05,974
<i><b>Let's work on that.</b></i>

887
00:37:16,526 --> 00:37:18,574
<i><b>Hey. Sorry I'm late.</b></i>

888
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:20,701
<i><b>I had to stop off
and get Joshua a present</b></i>

889
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:22,327
<i><b>'cause I wanted to
welcome him into the family.</b></i>

890
00:37:22,407 --> 00:37:24,080
<i><b>Louis, that is so sweet.</b></i>

891
00:37:24,409 --> 00:37:26,161
<i><b>But it turns out
Joshua can't make it.</b></i>

892
00:37:26,995 --> 00:37:28,542
<i><b>What do you mean,
he can't make it?</b></i>

893
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:30,589
<i><b>He was going to fly in, but
something came up with work,</b></i>

894
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:32,167
<i><b>so he canceled his flight.</b></i>

895
00:37:34,419 --> 00:37:35,887
<i><b>What the hell
kind of father is that?</b></i>

896
00:37:36,171 --> 00:37:38,344
<i><b>Louis. This is bullshit.
It's his flesh</b></i>

897
00:37:38,423 --> 00:37:39,891
<i><b>and his blood and if he's
going to be a father,</b></i>

898
00:37:39,966 --> 00:37:41,434
<i><b>he needs to be a father.</b></i>

899
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:42,589
<i><b>What are you talking about?</b></i>

900
00:37:42,635 --> 00:37:44,603
<i><b>You didn't even want him to
be here in the first place.</b></i>

901
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:46,022
<i><b>Well, I want him here now.</b></i>

902
00:37:46,347 --> 00:37:50,022
<i><b>Louis, I thought you were a more
forgiving person than this.</b></i>

903
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:51,895
<i><b>And I thought you wanted our
baby to have a relationship</b></i>

904
00:37:51,978 --> 00:37:53,230
<i><b>with its biological father.</b></i>

905
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,857
<i><b>And he's going to.</b></i>

906
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:59,319
<i><b>But if you're going to get this
worked up about something like this,</b></i>

907
00:38:00,195 --> 00:38:03,790
<i><b>it makes me think
I don't really know you.</b></i>

908
00:38:04,866 --> 00:38:07,915
<i><b>Louis, can you honestly tell
me that you really know me?</b></i>

909
00:38:08,912 --> 00:38:10,112
<i><b>Are we ready
to take a picture?</b></i>

910
00:38:14,876 --> 00:38:16,173
<i><b>No, I don't.</b></i>

911
00:38:18,087 --> 00:38:20,556
<i><b>And now, I feel like
I'm ruining this. So...</b></i>

912
00:38:21,758 --> 00:38:23,806
<i><b>If you don't want me
to come in with you, I won't.</b></i>

913
00:38:24,219 --> 00:38:27,644
<i><b>Maybe it's best
if I just do this myself.</b></i>

914
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:38,908
<i><b>Your Honor, this incident
occurred three nights ago,</b></i>

915
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:40,985
<i><b>yet the boy has
a history of asthma,</b></i>

916
00:38:41,069 --> 00:38:43,197
<i><b>proving one has nothing
to do with the other.</b></i>

917
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:47,371
<i><b>These hospital records show friable
construction material in his lungs.</b></i>

918
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:49,160
<i><b>How did it get there?</b></i>

919
00:38:49,244 --> 00:38:51,747
<i><b>It could have gotten there
from 100 different places.</b></i>

920
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:56,131
<i><b>This case is based entirely on
speculation and it should be dismissed.</b></i>

921
00:38:56,209 --> 00:38:58,303
<i><b>This case is based on the
fact that your client</b></i>

922
00:38:58,378 --> 00:39:00,506
<i><b>started construction while tenants
were still in the building</b></i>

923
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:02,340
<i><b>in violation
of the Real Estate Code.</b></i>

924
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:04,801
<i><b>And what if I told you
Ms. Price signed off on this?</b></i>

925
00:39:04,884 --> 00:39:07,103
<i><b>I'd say that's not possible
because she didn't.</b></i>

926
00:39:07,262 --> 00:39:09,230
<i><b>Well, you've got documents.</b></i>

927
00:39:09,597 --> 00:39:11,065
<i><b>And I have one, too.</b></i>

928
00:39:11,474 --> 00:39:14,603
<i><b>This is a copy of a certified
letter from my client</b></i>

929
00:39:14,686 --> 00:39:16,780
<i><b>to the remaining tenants
three weeks ago.</b></i>

930
00:39:16,855 --> 00:39:18,482
<i><b>Stating that construction
will begin,</b></i>

931
00:39:18,565 --> 00:39:21,444
<i><b>giving fair warning
to the occupants.</b></i>

932
00:39:21,901 --> 00:39:23,461
<i><b>Your Honor, my client's
never seen that.</b></i>

933
00:39:23,528 --> 00:39:26,372
<i><b>Well, she might not have
seen it, but she got it.</b></i>

934
00:39:26,447 --> 00:39:28,620
<i><b>It doesn't mean she opened it or...
Or even read it.</b></i>

935
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:30,247
<i><b>According to the City,
that doesn't matter.</b></i>

936
00:39:30,326 --> 00:39:32,579

938

<i><b>"by certified letter."</b></i>

939
00:39:36,958 --> 00:39:38,801
<i><b>Is this a certified letter

940
00:39:38,877 --> 00:39:40,504
<i><b>God damn it,
Oliver, say it's inadmissible.</b></i>

941
00:39:40,587 --> 00:39:41,679
<i><b>Yes, it is, but...</b></i>

942
00:39:41,754 --> 00:39:43,756
<i><b>So, you admit that she was
notified, and therefore my client</b></i>

943
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:46,138
<i><b>should be absolved

944
00:39:47,844 --> 00:39:49,141
<i><b>I... I don't. I...</b></i>

945
00:39:57,687 --> 00:39:58,859
<i><b>Objection.</b></i>

946
00:39:58,938 --> 00:40:01,032
<i><b>Your Honor, this is
the fraudulent attorney</b></i>

947
00:40:01,107 --> 00:40:02,529
<i><b>I spoke with you about
before trial.</b></i>

948
00:40:02,609 --> 00:40:05,579
<i><b>We ask that he either
refrain from speaking</b></i>

949
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:06,905

from the court</b></i>

950

951
00:40:09,324 --> 00:40:10,416
<i><b>Request granted.</b></i>

952
00:40:10,742 --> 00:40:12,585
<i><b>Sir, open your mouth
in my courtroom again</b></i>

953
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:15,834
<i><b>and you will be removed and
this case will be dismissed.</b></i>

954
00:40:16,289 --> 00:40:17,336
<i><b>Mr. Grady,
do you have an objection</b></i>

955
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:19,292
<i><b>to Ms. Johnson's statement
or not?</b></i>

956
00:40:21,127 --> 00:40:22,128
<i><b>I don't.</b></i>

957
00:40:22,378 --> 00:40:23,800
<i><b>I'm sorry, I don't.</b></i>

958
00:40:24,172 --> 00:40:25,424
<i><b>Then the court
has no choice</b></i>

959
00:40:25,506 --> 00:40:27,600
<i><b>but to dismiss
this case with prejudice.</b></i>

960
00:40:35,141 --> 00:40:37,269
<i><b>Benjamin, before you ask,
I already told you...</b></i>

961
00:40:37,352 --> 00:40:38,979
<i><b>What if I could
make it more like you?</b></i>

962
00:40:39,646 --> 00:40:41,023
<i><b>What do you mean?</b></i>

963
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:42,277
<i><b>You said what makes you
special is your intuition,</b></i>

964
00:40:42,357 --> 00:40:43,324
<i><b>your empathy
and your heart.</b></i>

965
00:40:43,399 --> 00:40:45,151
<i><b>What if I could
make it have that?</b></i>

966
00:40:45,234 --> 00:40:47,282
<i><b>How could you
possibly do that?</b></i>

967
00:40:47,362 --> 00:40:48,989
<i><b>The same way I gave it the ability
to learn from your quips,</b></i>

968
00:40:49,072 --> 00:40:51,825
<i><b>I might be able to give it the
ability to learn from your heart.</b></i>

969
00:40:51,908 --> 00:40:53,535
<i><b>But it would require
your help.</b></i>

970
00:40:54,661 --> 00:40:56,288
<i><b>You really think
we could do that?</b></i>

971
00:40:56,537 --> 00:40:59,541
<i><b>I don't know.
But I know we can try.</b></i>

972
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:02,544
<i><b>Well, then, the first thing
that you need to learn</b></i>

973
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:06,631
<i><b>is never ever,
ever sit in my chair.</b></i>

974
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:08,637
<i><b>Oh. I'm sorry.
I was...</b></i>

975
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:10,639
<i><b>Relax, Benjamin.
I'm just messing with you.</b></i>

976
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:12,311
<i><b>But get out of my chair.</b></i>

977
00:41:12,387 --> 00:41:13,639
<i><b>Yeah.</b></i>

978
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:28,870
<i><b>Louis, what...
What are you doing here?</b></i>

979
00:41:30,446 --> 00:41:32,289
<i><b>I needed to bring you
a few things.</b></i>

980
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:34,917
<i><b>What is all that?</b></i>

981
00:41:36,869 --> 00:41:38,371
<i><b>High school yearbooks,</b></i>

982
00:41:38,454 --> 00:41:41,458
<i><b>childhood photo albums, and six out
of seven of the highlight reels</b></i>

983
00:41:41,541 --> 00:41:43,589
<i><b>my mother shot of us
growing up.</b></i>

984
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:46,429
<i><b>What happened to the seventh?
Oh.</b></i>

985
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:48,131
<i><b>The Summer of D&D.</b></i>

986
00:41:48,423 --> 00:41:50,300
<i><b>And if it's
all the same to you,</b></i>

987
00:41:50,383 --> 00:41:52,263
<i><b>I would like to still be
able to have sex again.</b></i>

988
00:41:56,139 --> 00:41:57,516
<i><b>Louis.
You were right.</b></i>

989
00:41:57,724 --> 00:41:59,647
<i><b>We don't know everything
about each other.</b></i>

990
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:04,189
<i><b>But that just means we need to
get to know each other better.</b></i>

991
00:42:05,732 --> 00:42:07,029
<i><b>And what better way
to get to know each other</b></i>

992
00:42:07,108 --> 00:42:10,612
<i><b>than by preparing to bring
our child into the world?</b></i>

993
00:42:12,822 --> 00:42:14,995
<i><b>Louis,
if this is your reaction</b></i>

994
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:16,621
<i><b>to what
we went through today,</b></i>

995
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:19,379
<i><b>I feel like
I know you better already.</b></i>

996
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:24,087
<i><b>Speaking of what
we went through today,</b></i>

997
00:42:24,834 --> 00:42:26,086
<i><b>how did it go?</b></i>

998
00:42:26,794 --> 00:42:30,640
<i><b>Why don't you take me home and
I'll tell you all about it?</b></i>

999
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:36,239
<i><b>Harvey, can I talk
to you for a second?</b></i>

1000
00:42:36,304 --> 00:42:38,181
<i><b>Sure, Rachel,
what's going on?</b></i>

1001
00:42:38,264 --> 00:42:41,143
<i><b>It's about my interview with the
character and fitness committee.</b></i>

1002
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:42,693
<i><b>What about it?
Louis tried to lie to me.</b></i>

1003
00:42:42,769 --> 00:42:45,067
<i><b>He said it was
some sort of mix-up.</b></i>

1004
00:42:45,146 --> 00:42:47,444
<i><b>But when
I asked Donna about it,</b></i>

1005
00:42:47,523 --> 00:42:49,400
<i><b>she told me that
you were the one</b></i>

1006
00:42:49,484 --> 00:42:51,236
<i><b>who went to see
that man for me.</b></i>

1007
00:42:51,319 --> 00:42:52,491
<i><b>Not Louis.</b></i>

1008
00:42:53,321 --> 00:42:55,449
<i><b>Look, Harvey, it's okay.
You can tell me.</b></i>

1009
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:57,951
<i><b>It was about Mike,
wasn't it?</b></i>

1010
00:42:58,034 --> 00:43:00,378
<i><b>No. It was about leverage.</b></i>

1011
00:43:01,496 --> 00:43:02,918
<i><b>What do you mean?</b></i>

1012
00:43:02,997 --> 00:43:04,294
<i><b>The guy
holding up your interview</b></i>

1013
00:43:04,373 --> 00:43:07,297
<i><b>was trying to get us to do something
because he thought he could.</b></i>

1014
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:09,007
<i><b>Are you going to?</b></i>

1015
00:43:09,629 --> 00:43:11,677
<i><b>Yes. He is.</b></i>

1016
00:43:13,341 --> 00:43:14,981
<i><b>Are you saying
what I think you're saying?</b></i>

1017
00:43:15,343 --> 00:43:16,595
<i><b>Yeah.</b></i>

1018
00:43:19,263 --> 00:43:20,480
