1
00:00:29,409 --> 00:00:33,697
<i>Drink up, me hearties, yo ho</i>

2
00:00:33,872 --> 00:00:38,402
<i>We kidnap and ravage
And don't give a hoot</i>

3
00:00:38,502 --> 00:00:42,406
<i>Drink up, me hearties, yo ho</i>

4
00:00:42,506 --> 00:00:45,826
<i>Yo ho, yo ho</i>

5
00:00:45,926 --> 00:00:48,795
<i>A pirate's life for me</i>

6
00:00:49,596 --> 00:00:54,835
<i>We extort, we pilfer, we filch and sack
Drink up--</i>

7
00:00:54,935 --> 00:00:56,420
Quiet, Missy.

8
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,714
Cursed pirates sail these waters.

9
00:00:58,814 --> 00:01:00,716
You don't wanna bring them
down on us, do you?

10
00:01:00,816 --> 00:01:02,851
Mr. Gibbs, that will do.

11
00:01:03,443 --> 00:01:05,804
She was singing about pirates.

12
00:01:05,904 --> 00:01:09,641
Bad luck to be singing about pirates
with us mired in this unnatural fog,

13
00:01:09,741 --> 00:01:13,486
- mark my words.
- Consider them marked.

14
00:01:14,037 --> 00:01:16,481
- On your way.
- Aye, lieutenant.

15
00:01:16,581 --> 00:01:18,742
It's bad luck to have a woman
on board too.

16
00:01:19,126 --> 00:01:21,904
Even a miniature one.

17
00:01:22,004 --> 00:01:24,664
I think it would be rather exciting
to meet a pirate.

18
00:01:26,299 --> 00:01:28,460
Think again, Miss Swann.

19
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:31,663
Vile and dissolute creatures,
the lot of them.

20
00:01:31,763 --> 00:01:34,458
I intend to see to it that any man
who sails under a pirate flag

21
00:01:34,558 --> 00:01:38,295
or wears a pirate brand
gets what he deserves:

22
00:01:38,395 --> 00:01:40,639
A short drop and a sudden stop.

23
00:01:44,568 --> 00:01:46,678
Lieutenant Norrington,
I appreciate your fervour,

24
00:01:46,778 --> 00:01:51,808
but I'm concerned about the effect
this subject will have upon my daughter.

25
00:01:51,908 --> 00:01:53,852
My apologies, Governor Swann.

26
00:01:53,952 --> 00:01:57,948
- Actually, I find it all fascinating.
- Yes, that's what concerns me.

27
00:02:26,151 --> 00:02:28,603
Look, a boy. There's a boy in the water.

28
00:02:31,198 --> 00:02:32,983
Man overboard!

29
00:02:34,242 --> 00:02:36,069
Man the ropes. Fetch a hook.

30
00:02:36,703 --> 00:02:38,989
Haul him aboard.

31
00:02:46,922 --> 00:02:51,876
- He's still breathing.
- Mary, Mother of God.

32
00:02:57,766 --> 00:02:59,050
What happened here?

33
00:03:00,352 --> 00:03:04,723
It was most likely the powder magazine.
Merchant vessels run heavily armed.

34
00:03:06,608 --> 00:03:07,892
A lot of good it did them.

35
00:03:08,527 --> 00:03:10,520
Everyone's thinking it. I'm just saying it.

36
00:03:11,321 --> 00:03:13,315
Pirates.

37
00:03:14,032 --> 00:03:17,944
There's no proof of that.
It was probably an accident.

38
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:20,897
- Rouse the captain immediately.
- Aye, sir.

39
00:03:20,997 --> 00:03:23,316
Heave to and take in sail.
Launch the boats.

40
00:03:23,416 --> 00:03:24,659
Heave to.

41
00:03:26,419 --> 00:03:29,614
Elizabeth,
I want you to accompany the boy.

42
00:03:29,714 --> 00:03:33,960
He'll be in your charge.
Take care of him.

43
00:03:52,779 --> 00:03:56,733
It's okay. My name's Elizabeth Swann.

44
00:03:58,076 --> 00:03:59,569
Will Turner.

45
00:04:00,412 --> 00:04:02,405
I'm watching over you, Will.

46
00:04:15,302 --> 00:04:17,037
You're a pirate.

47
00:04:17,137 --> 00:04:18,997
Has he said anything?

48
00:04:19,097 --> 00:04:22,425
His name's William Turner.
That's all I found out.

49
00:04:23,393 --> 00:04:25,637
Take him below.

50
00:05:34,965 --> 00:05:36,833
Elizabeth?

51
00:05:38,593 --> 00:05:40,628
Are you all right?

52
00:05:41,304 --> 00:05:46,126
- Are you decent?
- Yes. Yes.

53
00:05:46,226 --> 00:05:49,512
You still abed at this hour?

54
00:05:50,355 --> 00:05:52,557
It's a beautiful day.

55
00:05:53,692 --> 00:05:56,394
I have a gift for you.

56
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:02,317
- Oh, it's beautiful.
- Isn't it?

57
00:06:03,201 --> 00:06:05,312
May I enquire as to the occasion?

58
00:06:05,412 --> 00:06:09,365
Does a father need an occasion
to dote upon his daughter?

59
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,784
Go on.

60
00:06:14,462 --> 00:06:16,748
Actually, I--

61
00:06:17,632 --> 00:06:20,035
I had hoped you might wear it
for the ceremony today.

62
00:06:20,135 --> 00:06:21,494
The ceremony?

63
00:06:21,594 --> 00:06:24,247
Captain Norrington's
promotion ceremony.

64
00:06:24,347 --> 00:06:25,790
I knew it.

65
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:28,760
Commodore Norrington,
as he's about to become.

66
00:06:29,227 --> 00:06:33,056
A fine gentleman, don't you think?
He fancies you, you know.

67
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:37,219
Elizabeth? How's it coming'?

68
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:39,721
It's difficult to say.

69
00:06:39,821 --> 00:06:41,765
I'm told it's the latest fashion in London.

70
00:06:41,865 --> 00:06:45,860
Well, women in London
must have learned not to breathe.

71
00:06:47,162 --> 00:06:48,905
My lord, you have a visitor.

72
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:12,220
- Mr. Turner, good to see you again.
- Good day, sir.

73
00:07:12,604 --> 00:07:13,930
I have your order.

74
00:07:20,862 --> 00:07:22,438
The blade is folded steel.

75
00:07:22,822 --> 00:07:26,059
That's gold filigree laid into the handle.

76
00:07:26,159 --> 00:07:28,486
If I may?

77
00:07:30,121 --> 00:07:35,034
Perfectly balanced. The tang
is nearly the full width of the blade.

78
00:07:37,045 --> 00:07:41,157
Impressive. Very impressive.
Well, now.

79
00:07:41,257 --> 00:07:44,752
Commodore Norrington's
going to be very pleased with this.

80
00:07:45,345 --> 00:07:47,964
Do pass my compliments
on to your master.

81
00:07:50,183 --> 00:07:52,135
I Shall.

82
00:07:52,477 --> 00:07:56,681
A craftsman is always pleased
to hear his work is appreciated.

83
00:07:57,732 --> 00:08:01,052
Elizabeth, you look absolutely stunning.

84
00:08:01,152 --> 00:08:05,815
Will. It's so good to see you.

85
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:08,893
- I had a dream about you last night.
- About me?

86
00:08:08,993 --> 00:08:11,021
Elizabeth, is that entirely proper
for you to--?

87
00:08:11,121 --> 00:08:12,856
About the day we met.
Do you remember?

88
00:08:12,956 --> 00:08:15,191
How could I forget, Miss Swann?

89
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:17,910
Will, how many times must I ask you
to call me Elizabeth?

90
00:08:18,461 --> 00:08:22,032
At least once more, Miss Swann,
as always.

91
00:08:22,132 --> 00:08:25,160
There, you see?
At least the boy has a sense of propriety.

92
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:28,212
Now, we really must be going.
There you are.

93
00:08:29,431 --> 00:08:30,798
Good day, Mr. Turner.

94
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:34,385
Come along.

95
00:08:36,646 --> 00:08:38,598
Good day...

96
00:08:40,733 --> 00:08:42,352
Elizabeth.

97
00:10:11,783 --> 00:10:15,945
What--? Hold up there, you.

98
00:10:16,204 --> 00:10:20,742
It's a shilling to tie up your boat
at the dock.

99
00:10:21,751 --> 00:10:23,411
And I shall need to know your name.

100
00:10:25,964 --> 00:10:29,709
What do you say to 3 shillings
and we forget the name?

101
00:10:33,471 --> 00:10:36,340
Welcome to Port Royal, Mr. Smith.

102
00:11:11,801 --> 00:11:13,711
Two paces, march!

103
00:11:16,347 --> 00:11:18,216
Right about face!

104
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:24,722
Present arms!

105
00:11:47,629 --> 00:11:51,950
- This dock is off-limits to civilians.
- I'm terribly sorry, I didn't know.

106
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:55,127
If I see one,
I shall inform you immediately.

107
00:11:58,556 --> 00:12:02,126
Apparently, there's some sort of
high-toned and fancy to do up at the fort.

108
00:12:02,226 --> 00:12:05,463
How could it be two upstanding gentlemen
such as yourselves

109
00:12:05,563 --> 00:12:07,640
did not merit an invitation?

110
00:12:08,358 --> 00:12:11,344
Someone has to make sure this dock
stays off-limits to civilians.

111
00:12:11,444 --> 00:12:17,108
It's a fine goal, to be sure,
but it seems to me a ship like that

112
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:20,812
makes this one here a bit superfluous,
really.

113
00:12:20,912 --> 00:12:23,773
Oh, the Dauntless is the power
in these waters, true enough.

114
00:12:23,873 --> 00:12:27,110
But there's no ship that can match
the Interceptor for speed.

115
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:31,739
I've heard of one. Supposed to be
very fast, nigh uncatchable.

116
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:33,708
The Black Pearl.

117
00:12:34,592 --> 00:12:40,006
Well, there's no real ship
that could match the Interceptor.

118
00:12:40,515 --> 00:12:44,168
- Black Pearl is a real ship.
- No. No, it's not.

119
00:12:44,268 --> 00:12:46,087
Yes, it is. I've seen it.

120
00:12:46,187 --> 00:12:48,598
- You've seen it?
- Yes.

121
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:51,634
- You haven't seen it.
- Yes, I have.

122
00:12:51,734 --> 00:12:55,054
You've seen a ship with black sails

123
00:12:55,154 --> 00:12:59,475
that's crewed by the damned
and captained by a man so evil

124
00:12:59,575 --> 00:13:02,812
that hell itself spat him back out?

125
00:13:02,912 --> 00:13:05,323
- No.
- No.

126
00:13:05,957 --> 00:13:08,192
But I have seen a ship with black sails.

127
00:13:08,292 --> 00:13:11,362
Oh, and no ship that's not crewed
by the damned

128
00:13:11,462 --> 00:13:14,282
and captained by a man so evil
that hell itself spat him out

129
00:13:14,382 --> 00:13:15,867
could possibly have black sails.

130
00:13:15,967 --> 00:13:18,870
Therefore it couldn't possibly be
any other ship than the Black Pearl.

131
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:21,130
Is that what you're saying?

132
00:13:21,639 --> 00:13:22,965
No.

133
00:13:23,224 --> 00:13:28,804
Like I said, there's no real ship
that could match the Interceptor.

134
00:13:30,231 --> 00:13:32,058
Hey!

135
00:13:32,275 --> 00:13:33,517
You!

136
00:13:34,402 --> 00:13:35,595
Get away from there.

137
00:13:35,695 --> 00:13:38,014
You don't have permission
to be aboard there, mate.

138
00:13:38,114 --> 00:13:40,983
I'm sorry. It's just--
It's such a pretty boat. Ship.

139
00:13:41,492 --> 00:13:42,735
What's your name?

140
00:13:42,994 --> 00:13:45,355
Smith. Or Smitty, if you like.

141
00:13:45,455 --> 00:13:48,775
What's your purpose in Port Royal,
Mr. Smith?

142
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:52,620
- And no lies.
- Why, then I confess.

143
00:13:53,379 --> 00:13:56,699
It is my intention to commandeer one
of these ships, pick up a crew in Tortuga,

144
00:13:56,799 --> 00:13:59,835
raid, pillage, plunder and otherwise pilfer
my weasely black guts out.

145
00:14:00,344 --> 00:14:03,756
- I said no lies.
- I think he's telling the truth.

146
00:14:04,182 --> 00:14:07,335
If he were telling the truth,
he wouldn't have told us.

147
00:14:07,435 --> 00:14:11,222
Unless, of course, he knew you wouldn't
believe the truth, even if he told it to you.

148
00:14:21,783 --> 00:14:23,317
May I have a moment?

149
00:14:32,335 --> 00:14:35,246
You look lovely, Elizabeth.

150
00:14:36,714 --> 00:14:43,004
I apologise if I seem forward,
but I must speak my mind.

151
00:14:45,014 --> 00:14:50,678
This promotion throws into sharp relief
that which I have not yet achieved.

152
00:14:53,105 --> 00:14:54,890
A marriage to a fine woman.

153
00:14:56,359 --> 00:14:59,645
You have become a fine woman,
Elizabeth.

154
00:14:59,987 --> 00:15:04,567
- I can't breathe.
- Yes, I'm a bit nervous myself.

155
00:15:07,328 --> 00:15:09,989
And then they made me their chief.

156
00:15:11,916 --> 00:15:13,826
Elizabeth?

157
00:15:15,837 --> 00:15:18,205
Elizabeth!

158
00:15:18,923 --> 00:15:22,209
- The rocks.
- Sir, it's a miracle she missed them.

159
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:27,673
- Will you be saving her then?
- I can't swim.

160
00:15:28,766 --> 00:15:32,511
Pride of the King's Navy, you are.
Do not lose these.

161
00:15:47,243 --> 00:15:49,320
What was that?

162
00:16:22,778 --> 00:16:24,814
Make way.

163
00:16:31,329 --> 00:16:33,280
I got her.

164
00:16:33,915 --> 00:16:35,616
- She's not breathing.
- Move.

165
00:16:42,131 --> 00:16:44,450
I never would have thought of that.

166
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:47,461
Clearly,
you've never been to Singapore.

167
00:16:52,516 --> 00:16:54,051
Where did you get that?

168
00:16:55,937 --> 00:16:57,680
On your feet.

169
00:16:59,774 --> 00:17:01,100
Elizabeth.

170
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,812
- Are you all right?
- Yes. Yes, I'm fine.

171
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:10,560
- Shoot him.
- Father.

172
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:11,986
- What?
- Commodore,

173
00:17:12,244 --> 00:17:14,071
do you really intend
to kill my rescuer?

174
00:17:21,379 --> 00:17:24,290
I believe thanks are in order.

175
00:17:27,802 --> 00:17:31,088
Had a brush with the East India
Trading Company, did we, pirate?

176
00:17:33,224 --> 00:17:34,542
Hang him.

177
00:17:34,642 --> 00:17:37,636
Keep your guns on him, men.
Gillette, fetch some irons.

178
00:17:38,729 --> 00:17:45,303
- Well, well, Jack Sparrow, isn't it?
- Captain Jack Sparrow, if you please.

179
00:17:45,403 --> 00:17:50,900
- Well, I don't see your ship, captain.
- I'm in the market, as it were.

180
00:17:51,117 --> 00:17:52,643
He said he came to commandeer one.

181
00:17:52,743 --> 00:17:56,739
I told you he was telling the truth.
These are his, sir.

182
00:17:59,667 --> 00:18:02,411
No additional shots nor powder.

183
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:06,081
A compass that doesn't point north.

184
00:18:10,928 --> 00:18:13,047
And I half-expected it
to be made of wood.

185
00:18:16,183 --> 00:18:19,178
You are, without doubt,
the worst pirate I've ever heard of.

186
00:18:20,062 --> 00:18:21,597
But you have heard of me.

187
00:18:24,442 --> 00:18:27,011
Commodore, I really must protest.

188
00:18:27,111 --> 00:18:28,638
Carefully, lieutenant.

189
00:18:28,738 --> 00:18:30,973
Pirate or not, this man saved my life.

190
00:18:31,073 --> 00:18:34,560
One good deed is not enough to redeem
a man of a lifetime of wickedness.

191
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:36,487
Though it seems enough
to condemn him.

192
00:18:36,746 --> 00:18:37,988
Indeed.

193
00:18:39,331 --> 00:18:41,242
Finally.

194
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:45,321
- No. No, don't shoot.
- I knew you'd warm up to me.

195
00:18:45,421 --> 00:18:48,582
Commodore Norrington,
my effects, please. And my hat.

196
00:18:50,176 --> 00:18:51,585
Commodore.

197
00:18:54,055 --> 00:18:57,166
- Elizabeth. It is Elizabeth, isn't it'?
- It's Miss Swann.

198
00:18:57,266 --> 00:19:00,002
Miss Swann, if you'd be so kind?

199
00:19:00,102 --> 00:19:02,638
Come, come, dear.
We don't have all day.

200
00:19:04,065 --> 00:19:05,516
Now, if you'll be very kind.

201
00:19:22,541 --> 00:19:23,993
Easy on the goods, darling.

202
00:19:25,377 --> 00:19:26,870
You're despicable.

203
00:19:27,088 --> 00:19:28,823
Sticks and stones, love.

204
00:19:28,923 --> 00:19:31,625
I saved your life, you save mine,
we're square.

205
00:19:32,635 --> 00:19:34,503
Gentlemen, my lady,

206
00:19:35,137 --> 00:19:36,831
you will always remember this
as the day

207
00:19:36,931 --> 00:19:41,343
that you almost caught
Captain Jack Sparrow.

208
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:03,157
- Now will you shoot him?
- Open fire!

209
00:20:10,381 --> 00:20:11,874
On his heels.

210
00:20:20,724 --> 00:20:24,219
- Take steady aim.
- Fire! Fire!

211
00:20:27,231 --> 00:20:30,051
- Fire.
- Take care of him. Fire!

212
00:20:30,151 --> 00:20:34,513
Gillette, Mr. Sparrow
has a dawn appointment with the gallows.

213
00:20:34,613 --> 00:20:37,316
I would hate for him to miss it.

214
00:20:40,411 --> 00:20:45,657
Search upstairs. Look lively, men.

215
00:22:17,633 --> 00:22:19,960
Right where I left you.

216
00:22:26,684 --> 00:22:28,302
Not where I left you.

217
00:22:38,696 --> 00:22:41,023
You're the one they're hunting.

218
00:22:41,532 --> 00:22:43,434
The pirate.

219
00:22:43,534 --> 00:22:46,111
You seem somewhat familiar.
Have I threatened you before?

220
00:22:46,537 --> 00:22:49,573
I make a point of avoiding familiarity
with pirates.

221
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:53,277
Well, it would be a shame
to put a black mark on your record.

222
00:22:53,377 --> 00:22:55,329
So if you'll excuse me?

223
00:22:58,966 --> 00:23:04,505
Do you think this wise, boy?
Crossing blades with a pirate?

224
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,215
You threatened Miss Swann.

225
00:23:09,518 --> 00:23:11,678
Only a little.

226
00:23:24,199 --> 00:23:27,319
You know what you're doing,
I'll give you that. Excellent form.

227
00:23:28,078 --> 00:23:29,947
But how's your footwork?

228
00:23:30,706 --> 00:23:32,115
If I step here--

229
00:23:33,375 --> 00:23:36,995
Very good. And now I step again.

230
00:23:42,092 --> 00:23:43,835
Ta.

231
00:24:02,863 --> 00:24:05,641
That is a wonderful trick.

232
00:24:05,741 --> 00:24:09,478
Except once again, you are between me
and my way out.

233
00:24:09,578 --> 00:24:12,823
And now you have no weapon.

234
00:24:35,104 --> 00:24:36,805
Who makes all these?

235
00:24:38,315 --> 00:24:39,600
I do.

236
00:24:39,942 --> 00:24:43,562
And I practise with them
three hours a day.

237
00:24:45,197 --> 00:24:47,024
You need to find yourself a girl, mate.

238
00:24:54,039 --> 00:24:57,109
Or perhaps the reason you practise
three hours a day

239
00:24:57,209 --> 00:24:58,986
is that you already found one

240
00:24:59,086 --> 00:25:02,823
and are otherwise incapable
of wooing said strumpet.

241
00:25:02,923 --> 00:25:05,200
You're not a eunuch, are you?

242
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:09,796
I practise three hours a day so that
when I meet a pirate, I can kill him.

243
00:26:26,882 --> 00:26:28,125
You cheated.

244
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:30,460
Pirate.

245
00:26:32,930 --> 00:26:35,048
- Move away.
- No.

246
00:26:35,349 --> 00:26:37,209
- Please move?
- No.

247
00:26:37,309 --> 00:26:40,429
I cannot just step aside
and let you escape.

248
00:26:42,773 --> 00:26:44,933
This shot is not meant for you.

249
00:26:45,567 --> 00:26:47,310
Come on.

250
00:26:55,035 --> 00:26:57,988
There he is. Over here.

251
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:02,067
Excellent work, Mr. Brown.

252
00:27:02,167 --> 00:27:04,987
You've assisted in the capture
of a dangerous fugitive.

253
00:27:05,087 --> 00:27:07,497
Just doing my civic duty, sir.

254
00:27:08,465 --> 00:27:10,951
Well, I trust that you will always remember
this as the day

255
00:27:11,051 --> 00:27:16,298
that Captain Jack Sparrow
almost escaped. Take him away.

256
00:27:21,311 --> 00:27:23,213
- Hey, come on.
- Can you smell it, boy?

257
00:27:23,313 --> 00:27:24,840
- Smell the bone.
- Come here, boy.

258
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:27,017
- Come on.
- You want a nice, juicy bone?

259
00:27:27,317 --> 00:27:29,094
- Come here, boy.
- Come on.

260
00:27:29,194 --> 00:27:31,430
- Come here, boy.
- You can keep doing that forever,

261
00:27:31,530 --> 00:27:33,807
the dog is never going to move.

262
00:27:33,907 --> 00:27:38,445
Oh, excuse us if we haven't resigned
ourselves to the gallows just yet.

263
00:27:44,751 --> 00:27:49,198
There you go, miss.
It was a difficult day for you, I'm sure.

264
00:27:49,298 --> 00:27:51,992
I suspected Commodore Norrington
would propose

265
00:27:52,092 --> 00:27:54,286
but I must admit,
I wasn't entirely prepared for it.

266
00:27:54,386 --> 00:27:59,257
Well, I meant your being threatened
by that pirate. It sounds terrifying.

267
00:28:00,225 --> 00:28:01,877
Yes, it was terrifying.

268
00:28:01,977 --> 00:28:05,297
But the commodore proposed.
Fancy that.

269
00:28:05,397 --> 00:28:09,134
Now, that's a smart match, miss,
if it's not too bold to say.

270
00:28:09,234 --> 00:28:11,770
It is a smart match.

271
00:28:12,154 --> 00:28:14,773
He's a fine man.

272
00:28:15,073 --> 00:28:17,567
The sort any woman should dream
of marrying.

273
00:28:18,535 --> 00:28:22,197
Well, that Will Turner,
he's a fine man too.

274
00:28:22,873 --> 00:28:24,858
That is too bold.

275
00:28:24,958 --> 00:28:29,204
Oh, begging your pardon, miss.
It was not my place.

276
00:29:17,511 --> 00:29:20,581
Has my daughter given you
an answer yet?

277
00:29:20,681 --> 00:29:22,416
No, she hasn't.

278
00:29:22,516 --> 00:29:26,011
Well, she has had a very trying day.

279
00:29:26,478 --> 00:29:31,766
- Ghastly weather, don't you think?
- Bleak. Very bleak.

280
00:29:32,317 --> 00:29:34,102
What's that?

281
00:29:34,444 --> 00:29:35,687
Cannon fire!

282
00:29:37,698 --> 00:29:39,733
Return fire.

283
00:29:40,117 --> 00:29:43,111
- I know those guns.
- Men to arms.

284
00:29:47,958 --> 00:29:49,826
It's the Pearl.

285
00:29:50,168 --> 00:29:52,370
The Black Pearl?

286
00:29:53,922 --> 00:29:55,490
I've heard stories.

287
00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:59,536
She's been preying on ships
and settlements for near ten years.

288
00:29:59,636 --> 00:30:03,415
- Never leaves any survivors.
- No survivors?

289
00:30:03,515 --> 00:30:05,800
Then where do the stories come from,
I wonder?

290
00:30:15,026 --> 00:30:17,187
Clear the dock!

291
00:30:30,667 --> 00:30:32,077
Mama!

292
00:30:38,759 --> 00:30:40,293
Mind your oars.

293
00:30:45,182 --> 00:30:47,417
Come on, you.

294
00:30:47,517 --> 00:30:50,512
I need that to see.

295
00:31:12,375 --> 00:31:14,494
Come back.

296
00:31:38,568 --> 00:31:40,929
- Sight the muzzle flash.
- Aim for the flashes.

297
00:31:41,029 --> 00:31:45,600
I need a full spread, fore and aft.
Mr. Stevens, more cartridges.

298
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:49,070
Governor.
Barricade yourself in my office.

299
00:31:49,871 --> 00:31:52,699
- Good God.
- That's an order.

300
00:32:10,851 --> 00:32:12,302
Don't!

301
00:32:12,686 --> 00:32:14,095
Hello, chum.

302
00:32:18,108 --> 00:32:19,684
Up there.

303
00:32:29,411 --> 00:32:32,022
Miss Swann,
they've come to kidnap you.

304
00:32:32,122 --> 00:32:34,399
- What?
- You're the governor's daughter.

305
00:32:34,499 --> 00:32:36,493
Come on, in here.

306
00:32:37,794 --> 00:32:39,154
Listen, they haven't seen you.

307
00:32:39,254 --> 00:32:42,415
Go hide and the first chance you can,
run to the fort.

308
00:32:50,056 --> 00:32:53,176
- No!
- Gotcha. Had enough?

309
00:32:58,481 --> 00:33:00,050
No, no. It's hot.

310
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:02,644
- I'm burning.
- Come on.

311
00:33:06,406 --> 00:33:08,775
Come on, you mates.

312
00:33:45,862 --> 00:33:49,766
We know you're here, poppet.

313
00:33:49,866 --> 00:33:52,735
- Poppet.
- Come out.

314
00:33:53,036 --> 00:33:56,447
And we promise we won't hurt you.

315
00:33:58,208 --> 00:34:01,236
We will find you, poppet.

316
00:34:01,336 --> 00:34:06,833
You've got something of ours
and it calls to us.

317
00:34:11,221 --> 00:34:14,299
The gold calls to us.

318
00:34:15,016 --> 00:34:17,510
The gold, the gold.

319
00:34:22,774 --> 00:34:24,517
Hello, poppet.

320
00:34:25,026 --> 00:34:26,978
Parley!

321
00:34:27,153 --> 00:34:28,972
- What?
- Parley.

322
00:34:29,072 --> 00:34:30,607
I invoke the right of parley.

323
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:34,477
According to the Code of the Brethren,
set down by Morgan and Bartholomew,

324
00:34:34,577 --> 00:34:37,647
- you have to take me to your captain.
- I know the code.

325
00:34:37,747 --> 00:34:39,149
If an adversary demands parley,

326
00:34:39,249 --> 00:34:41,651
you can do then no harm
until the parley is complete.

327
00:34:41,751 --> 00:34:45,455
- To blazes with the code.
- She wants to be taken to the captain.

328
00:34:46,756 --> 00:34:49,959
And she'll go without a fuss.

329
00:34:50,176 --> 00:34:53,338
We must honour the code.

330
00:35:03,898 --> 00:35:05,350
Say goodbye.

331
00:35:09,863 --> 00:35:11,314
Goodbye.

332
00:35:15,618 --> 00:35:17,195
- Come on.
- Elizabeth.

333
00:35:18,830 --> 00:35:20,949
Hello.

334
00:35:26,546 --> 00:35:29,207
Out of my way, scum.

335
00:35:40,769 --> 00:35:43,763
My sympathies, friend.
You've no matter of luck at all.

336
00:36:06,127 --> 00:36:07,620
Come on, doggie.

337
00:36:07,796 --> 00:36:11,032
It's just you and me now.
It's you and old Jack.

338
00:36:11,132 --> 00:36:13,793
Come on. Come on, that's it, boy.

339
00:36:14,052 --> 00:36:16,045
Good boy. Come and get the bone.

340
00:36:16,346 --> 00:36:17,714
That's a good boy. Come on.

341
00:36:17,972 --> 00:36:21,918
A bit closer. A bit closer.
That's it. That's it, doggie.

342
00:36:22,018 --> 00:36:25,596
Come on, you filthy, slimy, mangy cur.

343
00:36:26,147 --> 00:36:30,977
Oh, no. Don't do that.
No, no, no, I didn't mean it. I didn't--

344
00:36:31,736 --> 00:36:33,479
Gotcha.

345
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,777
This ain't the armoury.

346
00:36:40,161 --> 00:36:44,399
Well, well, well.
Look what we have here, Twigg.

347
00:36:44,499 --> 00:36:47,652
Captain Jack Sparrow.

348
00:36:47,752 --> 00:36:54,534
Last time I saw you, you were all alone
on a godforsaken island

349
00:36:54,634 --> 00:36:56,786
shrinking into the distance.

350
00:36:56,886 --> 00:36:59,372
His fortunes aren't improved much.

351
00:36:59,472 --> 00:37:02,792
Worry about your own fortunes,
gentlemen.

352
00:37:02,892 --> 00:37:08,139
The deepest circle of hell
is reserved for betrayers and mutineers.

353
00:37:11,609 --> 00:37:14,312
So there is a curse.

354
00:37:15,488 --> 00:37:19,817
- That's interesting.
- You know nothing of hell.

355
00:37:27,333 --> 00:37:30,203
That's very interesting.

356
00:38:03,786 --> 00:38:04,938
No!

357
00:38:05,038 --> 00:38:07,357
I didn't know we was taking on captives.

358
00:38:07,457 --> 00:38:10,485
She's invoked the right of parley
with Captain Barbossa.

359
00:38:10,585 --> 00:38:14,539
- I'm here to negotiate--
- You will speak when spoken to.

360
00:38:15,506 --> 00:38:20,411
And ye'll not lay a hand
on those under the protection of parley.

361
00:38:20,511 --> 00:38:22,713
Aye, sir.

362
00:38:24,682 --> 00:38:26,509
My apologies, miss.

363
00:38:27,477 --> 00:38:29,546
Captain Barbossa,

364
00:38:29,646 --> 00:38:33,391
I am here to negotiate the cessation
of hostilities against Port Royal.

365
00:38:34,108 --> 00:38:36,136
There were a lot of long words
in there, miss.

366
00:38:36,236 --> 00:38:41,057
We're nought but humble pirates.
What is it that you want?

367
00:38:41,157 --> 00:38:44,444
I want you to leave
and never come back.

368
00:38:45,870 --> 00:38:48,614
I'm disinclined to acquiesce
to your request.

369
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:52,535
Means no.

370
00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:54,912
Very well.

371
00:38:57,423 --> 00:38:58,666
I'll drop it.

372
00:39:03,471 --> 00:39:09,343
Me holds are bursting with swag.
That bit of shine matters to us? Why?

373
00:39:10,270 --> 00:39:13,014
It's what you've been searching for.

374
00:39:13,189 --> 00:39:16,726
I recognise this ship. I saw it eight years
ago on the crossing from England.

375
00:39:17,235 --> 00:39:19,479
Did you, now?

376
00:39:21,447 --> 00:39:23,224
Fine.

377
00:39:23,324 --> 00:39:26,611
Well, I suppose if it is worthless,
then there's no point in me keeping it.

378
00:39:27,245 --> 00:39:29,030
No.

379
00:39:39,132 --> 00:39:41,501
You have a name, Missy?

380
00:39:42,343 --> 00:39:46,047
Elizabeth Turner.

381
00:39:46,389 --> 00:39:49,217
I'm a maid in the governor's household.

382
00:39:51,477 --> 00:39:54,096
Miss Turner.

383
00:39:54,314 --> 00:39:57,683
- Turner?
- Bootstrap.

384
00:40:00,737 --> 00:40:03,389
And how does a maid come to own
a trinket such as that?

385
00:40:03,489 --> 00:40:06,317
Family heirloom perhaps?

386
00:40:06,909 --> 00:40:08,861
I didn't steal it if that's what you mean.

387
00:40:10,204 --> 00:40:13,066
Very well. You hand it over
and we'll put your town to our rudder

388
00:40:13,166 --> 00:40:14,784
and ne'er return.

389
00:40:28,556 --> 00:40:30,633
Our bargain?

390
00:40:32,602 --> 00:40:36,047
Still the guns and stow them.
Signal the men. Set the flags.

391
00:40:36,147 --> 00:40:39,259
- Make good to clear port.
- Wait. You have to take me to shore.

392
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:41,769
- According to the Code of the Order--
- First,

393
00:40:42,111 --> 00:40:45,139
your return to shore was not part
of our negotiations nor our agreement,

394
00:40:45,239 --> 00:40:46,641
so I must do nothing.

395
00:40:46,741 --> 00:40:50,311
And secondly, you must be a pirate for
the Pirates' Code to apply, and you're not.

396
00:40:50,411 --> 00:40:56,025
And thirdly, the Code is more what
you'd call guidelines than actual rules.

397
00:40:56,125 --> 00:40:59,245
Welcome aboard the Black Pearl,
Miss Turner.

398
00:41:20,525 --> 00:41:22,476
They've taken her.
They've taken Elizabeth.

399
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:26,222
Mr. Murtogg, remove this man.

400
00:41:26,322 --> 00:41:28,316
We have to hunt them down.
We must save her.

401
00:41:28,699 --> 00:41:31,352
And where do you propose we start?

402
00:41:31,452 --> 00:41:35,406
If you have any information
concerning my daughter, please share it.

403
00:41:37,417 --> 00:41:39,493
That Jack Sparrow,

404
00:41:40,294 --> 00:41:43,748
- he talked about the Black Pearl.
- Mentioned it is more what he did.

405
00:41:45,258 --> 00:41:48,286
Ask him where it is. Make a deal with him.
He could lead us to it.

406
00:41:48,386 --> 00:41:53,249
No. The pirates who invaded this fort
left Sparrow locked in his cell.

407
00:41:53,349 --> 00:41:56,336
Ergo, they are not his allies.

408
00:41:56,436 --> 00:41:59,255
Governor, we will establish
their most likely course and launch--

409
00:41:59,355 --> 00:42:01,432
That's not good enough!

410
00:42:01,732 --> 00:42:03,476
Mr. Turner,

411
00:42:04,110 --> 00:42:07,063
you are not a military man.
You are not a sailor.

412
00:42:07,989 --> 00:42:09,307
You are a blacksmith.

413
00:42:09,407 --> 00:42:13,569
And this is not the moment
for rash actions.

414
00:42:14,745 --> 00:42:16,272
Do not make the mistake of thinking

415
00:42:16,372 --> 00:42:19,241
you are the only man here
who cares for Elizabeth.

416
00:42:24,213 --> 00:42:27,208
Please, please.

417
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:33,539
- You, Sparrow.
- Aye?

418
00:42:33,639 --> 00:42:36,550
You're familiar with that ship,
the Black Pearl?

419
00:42:36,893 --> 00:42:39,087
- I've heard of it.
- Where does it make berth?

420
00:42:39,187 --> 00:42:42,473
Where does it make berth?
Have you not heard the stories?

421
00:42:45,276 --> 00:42:49,180
Captain Barbossa
and his crew of miscreants

422
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:51,974
sail from the dreaded Isla de Muerta.

423
00:42:52,074 --> 00:42:55,069
It's an island that cannot be found,

424
00:42:55,203 --> 00:42:57,655
except by those
who already know where it is.

425
00:42:57,914 --> 00:43:00,066
The ship's real enough.

426
00:43:00,166 --> 00:43:02,868
Therefore its anchorage
must be a real place. Where is it?

427
00:43:03,586 --> 00:43:05,037
Why ask me?

428
00:43:05,630 --> 00:43:07,156
Because you're a pirate.

429
00:43:07,256 --> 00:43:10,418
And you want to turn pirate yourself,
is that it?

430
00:43:11,302 --> 00:43:13,087
Never.

431
00:43:15,848 --> 00:43:19,502
- They took Miss Swann.
- Oh, so it is that you found a girl.

432
00:43:19,602 --> 00:43:21,379
I see.

433
00:43:21,479 --> 00:43:24,006
Well, if you're intending to brave all,
hasten to her rescue,

434
00:43:24,106 --> 00:43:29,262
and so win fair lady's heart,
you'll have to do it alone, mate.

435
00:43:29,362 --> 00:43:31,188
I see no profit in it for me.

436
00:43:32,031 --> 00:43:35,234
- I can get you out of here.
- How's that? The key's run off.

437
00:43:35,618 --> 00:43:36,944
I helped build these cells.

438
00:43:37,370 --> 00:43:39,739
These are half-pin barrel hinges.

439
00:43:40,998 --> 00:43:44,326
With the right leverage
and the proper application of strength,

440
00:43:45,378 --> 00:43:46,871
the door will lift free.

441
00:43:49,090 --> 00:43:50,541
What's your name?

442
00:43:51,217 --> 00:43:52,543
Will Turner.

443
00:43:53,678 --> 00:43:58,040
That would be short for William,
I imagine. Good strong name.

444
00:43:58,140 --> 00:44:00,342
No doubt named for your father, eh?

445
00:44:01,811 --> 00:44:03,053
Yes.

446
00:44:05,690 --> 00:44:08,885
Well, Mr. Turner,
I've changed me mind.

447
00:44:08,985 --> 00:44:12,138
If you spring me from this cell,
I swear on pain of death,

448
00:44:12,238 --> 00:44:16,350
I shall take you to the Black Pearl
and your bonnie lass.

449
00:44:16,450 --> 00:44:18,861
Do we have an accord?

450
00:44:21,831 --> 00:44:23,483
- Agreed.
- Agreed.

451
00:44:23,583 --> 00:44:25,242
Get me out.

452
00:44:28,212 --> 00:44:32,124
- Hurry. Someone will have heard that.
- Not without my effects.

453
00:44:38,556 --> 00:44:40,883
We're gonna steal the ship.

454
00:44:42,143 --> 00:44:44,754
- That ship?
- Commandeer.

455
00:44:44,854 --> 00:44:48,390
We're gonna commandeer that ship.
Nautical term.

456
00:44:49,191 --> 00:44:52,428
One question about your business, boy,
or there's no use going.

457
00:44:52,528 --> 00:44:56,933
This girl,
how far are you willing to go to save her?

458
00:44:57,033 --> 00:45:01,779
- I'd die for her.
- Oh, good. No worries, then.

459
00:45:20,723 --> 00:45:24,043
This is either madness or brilliance.

460
00:45:24,143 --> 00:45:27,805
It's remarkable
how often those two traits coincide.

461
00:45:57,301 --> 00:46:01,122
Everyone, stay calm.
We are taking over the ship.

462
00:46:01,222 --> 00:46:03,340
Aye. Avast.

463
00:46:06,185 --> 00:46:09,255
This ship cannot be crewed
by two men.

464
00:46:09,355 --> 00:46:11,223
You'll never make it out of the bay.

465
00:46:11,941 --> 00:46:13,517
Son,

466
00:46:13,776 --> 00:46:16,812
I'm Captain Jack Sparrow.

467
00:46:17,071 --> 00:46:18,439
Savvy?

468
00:46:21,826 --> 00:46:26,405
- Commodore.
- Sir, they've taken the Dauntless.

469
00:46:27,373 --> 00:46:31,652
Commodore! They've taken the ship!

470
00:46:31,752 --> 00:46:33,904
Sparrow and Turner,
they've taken the Dauntless.

471
00:46:34,004 --> 00:46:37,249
Rash, Turner. Too rash.

472
00:46:38,718 --> 00:46:43,297
That is, without doubt, the worst pirate
I have ever seen.

473
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:47,635
Here they come.

474
00:46:52,189 --> 00:46:55,509
Bring her around! Bring her around!

475
00:46:55,609 --> 00:46:58,854
- Hold on!
- Grab on!

476
00:47:01,449 --> 00:47:03,601
Search every cabin, every hold,
down to the bilges.

477
00:47:03,701 --> 00:47:05,778
This way, men.

478
00:47:17,465 --> 00:47:20,242
- Check the aft.
- And the portside.

479
00:47:20,342 --> 00:47:23,295
- Sailors, back to the Interceptor, now.
- Quickly, men.

480
00:47:29,727 --> 00:47:33,130
Thank you, commodore,
for getting us ready to make way.

481
00:47:33,230 --> 00:47:35,891
We'd have had a hard time of it
by ourselves.

482
00:47:39,278 --> 00:47:41,138
Set topsails and clear up this mess.

483
00:47:41,238 --> 00:47:43,432
With the wind a quarter astern,
we won't catch them.

484
00:47:43,532 --> 00:47:46,227
I don't need to catch them.
Get them in range of the long nines.

485
00:47:46,327 --> 00:47:48,988
Helm, come about! Run out the guns!

486
00:47:50,414 --> 00:47:53,025
We are to fire on our own ship, sir?

487
00:47:53,125 --> 00:47:57,746
I'd rather see her at the bottom
of the ocean than in the hands of a pirate.

488
00:47:58,088 --> 00:48:01,625
Commodore.
He's disabled the rudder chain, sir.

489
00:48:05,262 --> 00:48:07,381
Abandon ship!

490
00:48:11,143 --> 00:48:13,504
- Let go the gear and sheet home.
- Sheet home, aye, sir.

491
00:48:13,604 --> 00:48:17,091
That's got to be the best pirate
I've ever seen.

492
00:48:17,191 --> 00:48:19,893
So it would seem.

493
00:48:28,452 --> 00:48:32,398
When I was a lad living in England,
my mother raised me by herself.

494
00:48:32,498 --> 00:48:37,244
After she died, I came out here
looking for my father.

495
00:48:37,753 --> 00:48:39,079
Is that so?

496
00:48:40,673 --> 00:48:43,208
My father? Bill Turner?

497
00:48:43,551 --> 00:48:46,704
In the jail, it was only after you learned
my name that you agreed to help.

498
00:48:46,804 --> 00:48:49,039
Since that's what I wanted,
I didn't press the matter.

499
00:48:49,139 --> 00:48:51,341
I'm not a simpleton, Jack.

500
00:48:51,559 --> 00:48:53,427
You knew my father.

501
00:48:59,275 --> 00:49:03,763
I knew him. Probably one of the few
who knew him as William Turner.

502
00:49:03,863 --> 00:49:06,849
Everyone else just called him Bootstrap
or Bootstrap Bill.

503
00:49:06,949 --> 00:49:08,192
Bootstrap?

504
00:49:09,034 --> 00:49:13,689
Good man. Good pirate.
I swear, you look just like him.

505
00:49:13,789 --> 00:49:16,650
It's not true.
He was a merchant sailor.

506
00:49:16,750 --> 00:49:18,986
A good, respectable man
who obeyed the law.

507
00:49:19,086 --> 00:49:21,330
He was a bloody pirate. A scallywag.

508
00:49:22,590 --> 00:49:26,410
My father was not a pirate.

509
00:49:26,510 --> 00:49:30,631
Put it away, son.
It's not worth you getting beat again.

510
00:49:30,764 --> 00:49:31,999
You didn't beat me.

511
00:49:32,099 --> 00:49:35,085
You ignored the rules of engagement.
In a fair fight, I'd kill you.

512
00:49:35,185 --> 00:49:38,305
Then that's not much incentive
for me to fight fair, then, is it'?

513
00:49:45,362 --> 00:49:48,599
Now, as long as you're just hanging there,
pay attention.

514
00:49:48,699 --> 00:49:51,519
The only rules that really matter
are these:

515
00:49:51,619 --> 00:49:55,239
What a man can do
and what a man can't do.

516
00:49:55,664 --> 00:50:00,027
For instance, you can accept that
your father was a pirate and a good man,

517
00:50:00,127 --> 00:50:02,696
or you can't.
But pirate is in your blood, boy,

518
00:50:02,796 --> 00:50:05,040
so you'll have to square with that
someday.

519
00:50:05,633 --> 00:50:08,786
Now, me, for example,
I can let you drown

520
00:50:08,886 --> 00:50:12,631
but I can't bring this ship into Tortuga
all by me onesies. Savvy?

521
00:50:13,098 --> 00:50:14,883
So.

522
00:50:18,854 --> 00:50:22,349
Can you sail
under the command of a pirate?

523
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:25,644
Or can you not?

524
00:50:27,488 --> 00:50:28,730
Tortuga?

525
00:50:29,448 --> 00:50:30,899
Tortuga.

526
00:50:53,222 --> 00:50:55,457
More importantly,
it is indeed a sad life

527
00:50:55,557 --> 00:50:58,502
that has never breathed deep
the sweet, proliferous bouquet

528
00:50:58,602 --> 00:51:01,221
that is Tortuga. Savvy?

529
00:51:01,772 --> 00:51:03,849
What do you think?

530
00:51:07,236 --> 00:51:08,345
It'll linger.

531
00:51:08,445 --> 00:51:10,097
I'll tell you, mate

532
00:51:10,197 --> 00:51:12,808
if every town in the world
were like this one,

533
00:51:12,908 --> 00:51:15,110
no man would ever feel unwanted.

534
00:51:16,745 --> 00:51:18,113
Scarlett.

535
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:21,366
Not sure I deserved that.

536
00:51:23,043 --> 00:51:24,486
Giselle.

537
00:51:24,586 --> 00:51:26,413
- Who was she?
- What?

538
00:51:28,632 --> 00:51:30,083
I may have deserved that.

539
00:51:32,219 --> 00:51:34,630
Curse you for breathing,
you slack-jawed idiot.

540
00:51:37,808 --> 00:51:41,670
Mother's love. Jack.

541
00:51:41,770 --> 00:51:44,882
You should know better
than to wake a man when he's sleeping.

542
00:51:44,982 --> 00:51:48,844
- It's bad luck.
- Fortunately, I know how to counter it.

543
00:51:48,944 --> 00:51:52,389
The man who did the waking
buys the man who was sleeping a drink.

544
00:51:52,489 --> 00:51:55,309
The man who was sleeping drinks it
while listening to a proposition

545
00:51:55,409 --> 00:51:57,736
from the man who did the waking.

546
00:51:59,705 --> 00:52:01,740
Aye. That'll about do it.

547
00:52:06,420 --> 00:52:08,872
Blast, I'm already awake!

548
00:52:09,089 --> 00:52:11,250
That was for the smell.

549
00:52:20,601 --> 00:52:23,011
Keep a sharp eye.

550
00:52:29,610 --> 00:52:34,106
Now, what's the nature
of this venture of yours?

551
00:52:34,698 --> 00:52:36,984
I'm going after the Black Pearl.

552
00:52:40,537 --> 00:52:44,157
I know where it's going to be
and I'm gonna take it.

553
00:52:45,167 --> 00:52:48,404
Jack, it's a fool's errand.

554
00:52:48,504 --> 00:52:51,699
Well, you know better than me
the tales of the Black Pearl.

555
00:52:51,799 --> 00:52:54,868
That's why I know
what Barbossa is up to.

556
00:52:54,968 --> 00:52:56,461
All I need is a crew.

557
00:52:57,304 --> 00:52:59,039
From what I hear tell
of Captain Barbossa,

558
00:52:59,139 --> 00:53:02,418
he's not a man to suffer fools,
nor strike a bargain with one.

559
00:53:02,518 --> 00:53:04,461
Then I'd say it's a good thing
I'm not a fool.

560
00:53:04,561 --> 00:53:06,088
Prove me wrong.

561
00:53:06,188 --> 00:53:09,675
What makes you think Barbossa
will give up his ship to you?

562
00:53:09,775 --> 00:53:13,937
Let's just say
it's a matter of leverage, eh?

563
00:53:29,336 --> 00:53:31,288
The kid?

564
00:53:31,839 --> 00:53:35,792
That is the child
of Bootstrap Bill Turner.

565
00:53:36,009 --> 00:53:38,587
His only child. Savvy?

566
00:53:38,846 --> 00:53:40,547
Is he, now?

567
00:53:43,684 --> 00:53:48,714
Leverage, says you.
I think I feel a change in the wind, says I.

568
00:53:48,814 --> 00:53:50,424
I'll find us a crew.

569
00:53:50,524 --> 00:53:53,352
There's bound to be some sailors
on this rock crazy as you.

570
00:53:53,610 --> 00:53:56,680
One can only hope. Take what you can.

571
00:53:56,780 --> 00:53:58,565
Give nothing back.

572
00:54:23,265 --> 00:54:25,217
You'll be dining with the captain.

573
00:54:25,475 --> 00:54:27,677
And he requests you wear this.

574
00:54:28,353 --> 00:54:30,547
Well, you may tell the captain
that I am disinclined

575
00:54:30,647 --> 00:54:32,224
to acquiesce to his request.

576
00:54:33,192 --> 00:54:35,385
He said you'd say that.

577
00:54:35,485 --> 00:54:39,973
He also said, if that be the case,
you'll be dining with the crew.

578
00:54:40,073 --> 00:54:41,858
And you'll be naked.

579
00:54:48,123 --> 00:54:49,366
Fine.

580
00:55:05,849 --> 00:55:09,594
There is no need to stand on ceremony,
no call to impress anyone.

581
00:55:10,562 --> 00:55:12,013
You must be hungry.

582
00:55:29,331 --> 00:55:31,491
Try the wine.

583
00:55:35,545 --> 00:55:37,831
And the apples. One of those next.

584
00:55:46,723 --> 00:55:48,467
It's poisoned.

585
00:55:49,851 --> 00:55:52,171
There would be no sense
to be killing you, Miss Turner.

586
00:55:52,271 --> 00:55:55,849
Then release me. You have your trinket,
I'm of no further value to you.

587
00:55:59,736 --> 00:56:04,975
- You don't know what this is, do you?
- It's a pirate medallion.

588
00:56:05,075 --> 00:56:08,520
This is Aztec gold.

589
00:56:08,620 --> 00:56:12,733
One of 882 identical pieces
they delivered in a stone chest

590
00:56:12,833 --> 00:56:15,903
to Cortés himself.

591
00:56:16,003 --> 00:56:20,908
Blood money paid to stem the slaughter
he wreaked upon them with his armies.

592
00:56:21,008 --> 00:56:24,203
But the greed of Cortés was insatiable.

593
00:56:24,303 --> 00:56:29,090
And so the heathen gods
placed upon the gold

594
00:56:29,558 --> 00:56:31,343
a terrible curse.

595
00:56:32,894 --> 00:56:37,966
Any mortal that removes
but a single piece from that stone chest

596
00:56:38,066 --> 00:56:41,853
shall be punished for eternity.

597
00:56:43,322 --> 00:56:46,308
I hardly believe in ghost stories any more,
Captain Barbossa.

598
00:56:46,408 --> 00:56:48,352
Aye.

599
00:56:48,452 --> 00:56:52,022
That's exactly what I thought
when we were first told the tale.

600
00:56:52,122 --> 00:56:54,775
Buried on an Island of the Dead
what cannot be found

601
00:56:54,875 --> 00:56:56,952
except for those who know where it is.

602
00:56:58,420 --> 00:57:00,956
Find it, We did.

603
00:57:01,465 --> 00:57:08,255
There be the chest. Inside be the gold.
And we took them all.

604
00:57:08,597 --> 00:57:10,249
We spent them and traded them

605
00:57:10,349 --> 00:57:14,711
and frittered them away on drink and food
and pleasurable company.

606
00:57:14,811 --> 00:57:20,850
The more we gave them away,
the more we came to realise

607
00:57:20,984 --> 00:57:27,849
the drink would not satisfy,
food turned to ash in our mouths,

608
00:57:27,949 --> 00:57:33,446
and all the pleasurable company
in the world could not slake our lust.

609
00:57:34,456 --> 00:57:38,285
We are cursed men, Miss Turner.

610
00:57:38,710 --> 00:57:44,958
Compelled by greed we were,
but now we are consumed by it.

611
00:57:56,395 --> 00:57:59,055
There is one way
we can end our curse.

612
00:58:02,901 --> 00:58:10,066
All the scattered pieces of the Aztec gold
must be restored and the blood repaid.

613
00:58:12,661 --> 00:58:14,237
Thanks to you

614
00:58:14,663 --> 00:58:17,198
we have the final piece.

615
00:58:18,250 --> 00:58:20,744
And the blood to be repaid?

616
00:58:21,044 --> 00:58:25,123
That's why there's no sense
to be killing you yet.

617
00:58:27,426 --> 00:58:28,668
Apple?

618
00:58:37,561 --> 00:58:39,346
No!

619
00:58:45,485 --> 00:58:49,522
I'm curious. After killing me,
what is it you're planning on doing next?

620
00:59:18,727 --> 00:59:20,220
Oh, no.

621
00:59:53,929 --> 00:59:58,750
Look. The moonlight shows us
for what we really are.

622
00:59:58,850 --> 01:00:02,003
We are not among the living,
and so we cannot die.

623
01:00:02,103 --> 01:00:04,514
But neither are we dead.

624
01:00:05,190 --> 01:00:08,885
For too long I've been parched of thirst
and unable to quench it.

625
01:00:08,985 --> 01:00:13,314
Too long I've been starving to death
and haven't died.

626
01:00:14,032 --> 01:00:16,268
I feel nothing.

627
01:00:16,368 --> 01:00:20,447
Not the wind on my face
nor the spray of the sea.

628
01:00:20,789 --> 01:00:23,992
Nor the warmth of a woman's flesh.

629
01:00:24,626 --> 01:00:28,280
You'd best start believing
in ghost stories, Miss Turner.

630
01:00:28,380 --> 01:00:29,622
You're in one.

631
01:00:48,608 --> 01:00:50,643
What are you looking at? Back to work.

632
01:00:51,194 --> 01:00:52,896
You heard the captain. Back to work.

633
01:00:59,786 --> 01:01:04,316
Feast your eyes, captain.
All of them faithful hands before the mast.

634
01:01:04,416 --> 01:01:09,779
Every man worth his salt.
And crazy, to boot.

635
01:01:09,879 --> 01:01:14,000
So this is your able-bodied crew?

636
01:01:18,930 --> 01:01:20,999
- You, sailor.
- Cotton, sir.

637
01:01:21,099 --> 01:01:24,794
Mr. Cotton, do you have the courage
and fortitude to follow orders

638
01:01:24,894 --> 01:01:27,972
and stay true in the face of danger
and almost certain death?

639
01:01:28,273 --> 01:01:31,176
Mr. Cotton. Answer, man.

640
01:01:31,276 --> 01:01:34,387
He's a mute, sir.
Poor devil had his tongue cutout.

641
01:01:34,487 --> 01:01:38,858
So he trained the parrot to talk for him.
No one's yet figured how.

642
01:01:41,328 --> 01:01:44,155
Mr. Cotton's parrot.

643
01:01:44,331 --> 01:01:45,657
Same question.

644
01:01:46,041 --> 01:01:49,494
Wind in your sails. Wind in your sails.

645
01:01:49,711 --> 01:01:55,033
- Mostly we figure that means, "Yes."
- Of course it does. Satisfied?

646
01:01:55,133 --> 01:01:57,244
Well, you've proved they're mad.

647
01:01:57,344 --> 01:01:59,212
And what's the benefit for us?

648
01:02:09,606 --> 01:02:11,808
Anamaria.

649
01:02:13,068 --> 01:02:15,103
I suppose you didn't deserve
that one either.

650
01:02:15,236 --> 01:02:18,857
- No, that one I deserved.
- You stole my boat.

651
01:02:19,157 --> 01:02:21,025
Actually--

652
01:02:22,035 --> 01:02:24,896
Borrowed.
Borrowed without permission.

653
01:02:24,996 --> 01:02:27,440
But with every intention
of bringing it back to you.

654
01:02:27,540 --> 01:02:31,160
- But you didn't.
- You'll get another one.

655
01:02:31,586 --> 01:02:33,822
- I will.
- A better one.

656
01:02:33,922 --> 01:02:35,740
A better one.

657
01:02:35,840 --> 01:02:37,625
- That one.
- What one?

658
01:02:40,220 --> 01:02:42,088
That one?

659
01:02:44,933 --> 01:02:47,460
Aye. That one. What say you?

660
01:02:47,560 --> 01:02:49,671
- Aye!
- Aye!

661
01:02:49,771 --> 01:02:51,590
Anchor's aweigh.

662
01:02:51,690 --> 01:02:55,927
No, no, no. It's frightful bad luck
to bring a woman aboard, sir.

663
01:02:56,027 --> 01:02:58,855
It'll be far worse not to have her.

664
01:03:32,063 --> 01:03:35,425
How can we sail to an island
that nobody can find

665
01:03:35,525 --> 01:03:39,771
- with a compass that doesn't work?
- Aye, the compass doesn't point north.

666
01:03:40,071 --> 01:03:42,690
But we're not trying to find north,
are we?

667
01:03:53,376 --> 01:03:55,745
We should drop canvas, sir.

668
01:03:56,045 --> 01:03:57,914
She can hold a bit longer.

669
01:04:00,008 --> 01:04:02,877
What in your head has put you
in such a fine mood, captain?

670
01:04:03,553 --> 01:04:05,630
We're catching up.

671
01:04:20,695 --> 01:04:22,730
Time to go, poppet-

672
01:05:18,086 --> 01:05:22,665
Dead men tell no tales.

673
01:05:25,134 --> 01:05:26,411
Puts a chill in the bones,

674
01:05:26,511 --> 01:05:29,797
how many honest sailors
have been claimed by this passage.

675
01:05:45,113 --> 01:05:47,390
How is it that Jack
came by that compass?

676
01:05:47,490 --> 01:05:50,477
Not a lot's known about Jack Sparrow
before he showed up in Tortuga

677
01:05:50,577 --> 01:05:53,521
with a mind to go after the treasure
of the Isla de Muerta.

678
01:05:53,621 --> 01:05:54,856
That was before I'd met him,

679
01:05:54,956 --> 01:05:57,200
back when he was captain
of the Black Pearl.

680
01:05:57,876 --> 01:05:59,118
What?

681
01:06:02,589 --> 01:06:04,240
He failed to mention that.

682
01:06:04,340 --> 01:06:06,367
Well, he plays things
close to the vest now.

683
01:06:06,467 --> 01:06:10,121
And a hard-learned lesson it was.
Three days out on the venture,

684
01:06:10,221 --> 01:06:13,166
the first mate comes to him
and says everything's an equal share,

685
01:06:13,266 --> 01:06:15,335
that should mean the location
of the treasure too.

686
01:06:15,435 --> 01:06:20,723
So Jack gives up the bearings.
That night there was a mutiny.

687
01:06:21,482 --> 01:06:24,594
They marooned Jack on an island
and left him to die.

688
01:06:24,694 --> 01:06:27,146
But not before he'd gone mad
with the heat.

689
01:06:31,075 --> 01:06:33,653
So that's the reason for all the:

690
01:06:35,705 --> 01:06:37,406
Reason's got nothing to do with it.

691
01:06:38,082 --> 01:06:40,276
Now, Will, when a pirate's marooned,

692
01:06:40,376 --> 01:06:43,446
he's given a pistol with a single shot.
One shot.

693
01:06:43,546 --> 01:06:46,616
Well, that won't do much good hunting
or to be rescued.

694
01:06:46,716 --> 01:06:50,245
But after three weeks
of a starving belly and thirst,

695
01:06:50,345 --> 01:06:53,540
that pistol starts to look real friendly.

696
01:06:53,640 --> 01:06:57,218
But Jack, he escaped the island,
and he still has that single shot.

697
01:06:57,435 --> 01:07:02,799
Oh, he won't use it, though,
save on one man. His mutinous first mate.

698
01:07:02,899 --> 01:07:05,601
- Barbossa.
- Aye.

699
01:07:06,194 --> 01:07:09,347
- How did Jack get off the island?
- Well, I'll tell you.

700
01:07:09,447 --> 01:07:11,015
He waded out into the shallows

701
01:07:11,115 --> 01:07:13,852
and he waited there three days
and three nights

702
01:07:13,952 --> 01:07:17,905
till all manner of sea creatures
became acclimated to his presence.

703
01:07:18,706 --> 01:07:20,316
Then on the fourth morning

704
01:07:20,416 --> 01:07:25,204
he roped himself a couple of sea turtles,
lashed them together and made a raft.

705
01:07:26,839 --> 01:07:31,836
- He roped a couple of sea turtles.
- Aye, sea turtles.

706
01:07:32,929 --> 01:07:34,172
What did he use for rope?

707
01:07:40,186 --> 01:07:44,807
Human hair. From my back.

708
01:07:45,149 --> 01:07:48,803
- Let go the anchor.
- Lower the anchor line!

709
01:07:48,903 --> 01:07:51,439
Young Mr. Turner and I
are to go ashore.

710
01:07:51,864 --> 01:07:55,518
Captain,
what if the worst should happen?

711
01:07:55,618 --> 01:07:59,530
- Keep to the Code.
- Aye, the Code.

712
01:08:24,063 --> 01:08:25,173
Move.

713
01:08:25,273 --> 01:08:30,937
Ten years of hoarding swag
and now we finally get to spend it.

714
01:08:37,201 --> 01:08:40,071
Once we're quit of the curse,
we'll be rich men.

715
01:08:40,580 --> 01:08:44,359
And you can buy an eye
what actually fits and is made of glass.

716
01:08:44,459 --> 01:08:47,536
This one does splinter
something terrible.

717
01:08:48,296 --> 01:08:49,789
Stop rubbing it.

718
01:09:09,484 --> 01:09:12,345
What code is Gibbs to keep to
if the worst should happen?

719
01:09:12,445 --> 01:09:16,315
Pirates' Code.
Any man who falls behind

720
01:09:17,325 --> 01:09:19,777
is left behind.

721
01:09:19,952 --> 01:09:22,989
No heroes amongst thieves, eh?

722
01:09:23,498 --> 01:09:25,984
You know, for having
such a bleak outlook on pirates

723
01:09:26,084 --> 01:09:29,078
you're well on your way
to becoming one.

724
01:09:29,420 --> 01:09:34,867
Sprung a man from jail,
commandeered a ship of the fleet,

725
01:09:34,967 --> 01:09:38,296
sailed with a buccaneer crew
out of Tortuga.

726
01:09:39,555 --> 01:09:42,967
And you're completely obsessed
with treasure.

727
01:09:45,686 --> 01:09:49,348
That's not true.
I am not obsessed with treasure.

728
01:09:56,405 --> 01:09:59,183
Not all treasure is silver and gold, mate.

729
01:09:59,283 --> 01:10:05,281
Gentlemen, the time has come.
Our salvation is nigh.

730
01:10:06,249 --> 01:10:10,236
- Our torment is near an end.
- Elizabeth.

731
01:10:10,336 --> 01:10:12,321
For ten years
we've been tested and tried,

732
01:10:12,421 --> 01:10:14,282
and each man-jack of you here

733
01:10:14,382 --> 01:10:17,660
has proved his mettle
a hundred times over.

734
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:21,172
And a hundred times again.

735
01:10:21,973 --> 01:10:23,591
Suffered I have.

736
01:10:24,350 --> 01:10:31,223
Punished we were, the lot of us.
Disproportionate to our crime.

737
01:10:33,067 --> 01:10:34,393
Here it is.

738
01:10:38,030 --> 01:10:41,692
The cursed treasure of Cortés himself.

739
01:10:43,286 --> 01:10:48,032
Every last piece that went astray
we have returned.

740
01:10:48,457 --> 01:10:49,784
Save for this.

741
01:10:50,334 --> 01:10:52,244
- Jack.
- Not yet.

742
01:10:54,088 --> 01:10:55,615
We wait for the opportune moment.

743
01:10:55,715 --> 01:10:59,243
Saving what we found,
despairing of ever finding the last.

744
01:10:59,343 --> 01:11:03,831
When's that?
When it's of greatest profit to you?

745
01:11:03,931 --> 01:11:06,467
May I ask you something?

746
01:11:06,684 --> 01:11:10,262
Have I ever given you reason
not to trust me?

747
01:11:10,438 --> 01:11:15,593
Do us a favour. I know it's difficult
for you, but please stay here.

748
01:11:15,693 --> 01:11:19,230
And try not to do anything stupid.

749
01:11:21,324 --> 01:11:23,684
And who among us has paid
the blood sacrifice

750
01:11:23,784 --> 01:11:26,278
owed to the heathen gods?

751
01:11:26,621 --> 01:11:29,949
- And whose blood must yet be paid?
- Hers!

752
01:11:33,085 --> 01:11:37,665
You know the first thing I'm gonna do
after the curse is lifted?

753
01:11:39,842 --> 01:11:42,461
Eat a whole bushel of apples.

754
01:11:51,020 --> 01:11:55,266
Begun by blood. By blood undone.

755
01:11:59,612 --> 01:12:03,399
Sorry, Jack.
I'm not gonna be your leverage.

756
01:12:12,625 --> 01:12:14,618
That's it?

757
01:12:14,919 --> 01:12:16,537
Waste not.

758
01:12:54,500 --> 01:12:55,826
Did it work?

759
01:12:56,460 --> 01:12:58,787
- I don't feel no different.
- How do we tell?

760
01:13:06,053 --> 01:13:07,379
You're not dead.

761
01:13:08,556 --> 01:13:10,090
No.

762
01:13:11,350 --> 01:13:13,794
- You shot me.
- It didn't work.

763
01:13:13,894 --> 01:13:15,930
The curse is still upon us.

764
01:13:20,818 --> 01:13:23,387
You. Maid. Your father.
What was his name?

765
01:13:23,487 --> 01:13:25,856
Was your father William Turner?

766
01:13:26,157 --> 01:13:28,768
- No.
- Where's his child?

767
01:13:28,868 --> 01:13:31,020
The child that sailed
from England eight years ago.

768
01:13:31,120 --> 01:13:33,814
The child in whose veins
flows the blood of William Turner?

769
01:13:33,914 --> 01:13:35,824
Where?

770
01:13:41,964 --> 01:13:46,168
You two.
You brought us the wrong person.

771
01:13:47,219 --> 01:13:51,457
No. She had the medallion.
She's the proper age.

772
01:13:51,557 --> 01:13:54,552
She said her name was Turner.
You heard her.

773
01:13:56,020 --> 01:13:58,389
I think she lied to us.

774
01:14:00,024 --> 01:14:02,434
You brought us here for nothing?

775
01:14:02,902 --> 01:14:04,720
I won't take questioning
or second guesses,

776
01:14:04,820 --> 01:14:06,555
not from the likes of you, Master Twigg.

777
01:14:06,655 --> 01:14:07,807
Who's to blame him?

778
01:14:07,907 --> 01:14:10,943
Every decision you've made
has led us from bad to worse.

779
01:14:13,079 --> 01:14:15,739
It was you who sent Bootstrap
to the depths.

780
01:14:19,585 --> 01:14:22,162
And it's you who brought us here
in the first place.

781
01:14:23,798 --> 01:14:26,625
If any coward here
dare challenge me, let him speak.

782
01:14:28,677 --> 01:14:33,457
I say we cut her throat
and spill all her blood, just in case.

783
01:14:33,557 --> 01:14:35,175
Yeah.

784
01:14:43,651 --> 01:14:46,762
The medallion! She's taken it!

785
01:14:46,862 --> 01:14:50,899
Get after her,
you feckless pack of ingrates.

786
01:14:54,787 --> 01:14:57,690
- There's no oars here.
- Where's the oars?

787
01:14:57,790 --> 01:15:00,701
- They stole the oars.
- The oars have gone missing.

788
01:15:01,335 --> 01:15:03,454
Find them.

789
01:15:07,007 --> 01:15:08,250
Find the oars.

790
01:15:11,303 --> 01:15:13,213
You.

791
01:15:14,265 --> 01:15:16,175
You're supposed to be dead.

792
01:15:16,517 --> 01:15:18,594
Am I not?

793
01:15:27,445 --> 01:15:29,438
Pearlie.

794
01:15:30,197 --> 01:15:32,650
Pa-la-la-leh-loo-loo.

795
01:15:35,119 --> 01:15:40,358
Parlinny. Parsnip. Parsley. Par--

796
01:15:40,458 --> 01:15:42,735
- Par-- No, partner.
- Parley?

797
01:15:42,835 --> 01:15:44,787
That's the one. Parley.

798
01:15:45,254 --> 01:15:48,824
- Parley.
- Parley?

799
01:15:48,924 --> 01:15:53,212
Damn to the depths whatever
muttonhead thought up parley.

800
01:15:54,847 --> 01:15:56,757
That would be the French.

801
01:16:08,402 --> 01:16:12,314
- Not more pirates.
- Welcome aboard, Miss Elizabeth.

802
01:16:12,865 --> 01:16:14,108
Mr. Gibbs?

803
01:16:14,617 --> 01:16:16,110
Hey, boy, where be Jack?

804
01:16:16,994 --> 01:16:20,698
Jack? Jack Sparrow?

805
01:16:21,207 --> 01:16:22,491
Fell behind.

806
01:16:29,924 --> 01:16:31,583
Keep to the Code.

807
01:16:32,885 --> 01:16:34,120
Weigh anchor.

808
01:16:34,220 --> 01:16:38,132
Hoist the sails.
Split-quick, you dibbies.

809
01:16:43,437 --> 01:16:46,640
How the blazes
did you get off that island?

810
01:16:47,942 --> 01:16:51,262
When you marooned me
on that godforsaken spit of land,

811
01:16:51,362 --> 01:16:53,939
you forgot one very important thing,
mate.

812
01:16:55,616 --> 01:16:57,943
I'm Captain Jack Sparrow.

813
01:16:58,827 --> 01:17:02,865
Well, I won't be making that mistake
again.

814
01:17:03,415 --> 01:17:06,360
Gents, you all remember
Captain Jack Sparrow.

815
01:17:06,460 --> 01:17:08,863
- Yeah.
- Aye.

816
01:17:08,963 --> 01:17:10,205
Kill him.

817
01:17:11,632 --> 01:17:14,877
The girl's blood didn't work, did it?

818
01:17:16,428 --> 01:17:18,672
Hold your fire.

819
01:17:24,395 --> 01:17:27,014
You know whose blood we need.

820
01:17:28,649 --> 01:17:30,559
I know whose blood you need.

821
01:17:37,658 --> 01:17:40,394
What sort of a man
trades a man's life for a ship?

822
01:17:40,494 --> 01:17:42,404
Pirate.

823
01:17:42,621 --> 01:17:47,951
- Here. Let me.
- Thank you.

824
01:17:49,044 --> 01:17:52,581
You said you gave Barbossa
my name as yours.

825
01:17:53,424 --> 01:17:55,167
Why?

826
01:17:57,511 --> 01:17:58,962
I don't know.

827
01:18:00,764 --> 01:18:03,626
I'm sorry. Blacksmith's hands.
I know they're rough.

828
01:18:03,726 --> 01:18:07,179
No. I mean, yes, they are but--

829
01:18:10,899 --> 01:18:13,060
But don't stop.

830
01:18:20,492 --> 01:18:22,528
Elizabeth.

831
01:18:37,968 --> 01:18:40,087
It's yours.

832
01:18:43,432 --> 01:18:45,676
I thought I'd lost it
the day they rescued me.

833
01:18:47,061 --> 01:18:48,554
It was a gift from my father.

834
01:18:49,480 --> 01:18:50,722
He sent it to me.

835
01:18:56,487 --> 01:18:57,938
Why did you take it?

836
01:18:59,948 --> 01:19:02,818
Because I was afraid
that you were a pirate.

837
01:19:04,203 --> 01:19:06,738
That would have been awful.

838
01:19:09,500 --> 01:19:11,451
It wasn't your blood they needed.

839
01:19:14,963 --> 01:19:17,541
It was my father's blood.

840
01:19:18,884 --> 01:19:20,919
My blood.

841
01:19:26,141 --> 01:19:30,053
- The blood of a pirate.
- Will, I'm so sorry. Please forgive me.

842
01:19:43,325 --> 01:19:45,352
So you expect to leave me standing
on some beach

843
01:19:45,452 --> 01:19:48,522
with nothing but a name
and your word it's the one I need,

844
01:19:48,622 --> 01:19:52,359
and watch you sail away in my ship?

845
01:19:52,459 --> 01:19:56,030
No. I expect to leave you
standing on some beach

846
01:19:56,130 --> 01:20:00,367
with absolutely no name at all,
watching me sail away on my ship,

847
01:20:00,467 --> 01:20:04,288
and then I'll shout the name
back to you. Savvy?

848
01:20:04,388 --> 01:20:07,124
But that leaves us with the problem
of me standing on some beach

849
01:20:07,224 --> 01:20:11,428
with nought but a name
and your word it's the one I need.

850
01:20:12,187 --> 01:20:17,593
Of the two of us, I am the only one
who hasn't committed mutiny.

851
01:20:17,693 --> 01:20:21,772
Therefore,
my word is the one we'll be trusting.

852
01:20:22,281 --> 01:20:24,850
Although, I suppose
I should be thanking you,

853
01:20:24,950 --> 01:20:28,654
because, in fact, if you hadn't betrayed me
and left me to die

854
01:20:29,455 --> 01:20:33,617
I would have an equal share in that curse,
same as you.

855
01:20:34,126 --> 01:20:35,410
Funny old world, isn't it?

856
01:20:39,298 --> 01:20:41,917
Captain, we're coming up
on the Interceptor.

857
01:20:54,897 --> 01:20:57,099
I'm having a thought here, Barbossa.

858
01:20:57,649 --> 01:21:01,387
What say we run up a flag of truce,
I scurry over to the Interceptor,

859
01:21:01,487 --> 01:21:05,724
and I negotiate the return
of your medallion? What say you to that?

860
01:21:05,824 --> 01:21:06,934
Now, you see, Jack,

861
01:21:07,034 --> 01:21:09,444
that's exactly the attitude
that lost you the Pearl.

862
01:21:09,620 --> 01:21:12,406
People are easier to search
when they're dead.

863
01:21:13,290 --> 01:21:15,659
Lock him in the brig.

864
01:21:27,262 --> 01:21:29,373
Hands aloft to loose the gallants!

865
01:21:29,473 --> 01:21:32,668
With this wind dead astern,
she'll carry every sail we've got.

866
01:21:32,768 --> 01:21:36,638
- What's happening?
- The Black Pearl. She's gaining on us.

867
01:21:41,318 --> 01:21:43,220
But this is the fastest ship
in the Caribbean.

868
01:21:43,320 --> 01:21:45,439
You can tell them that
after they've caught us.

869
01:21:46,657 --> 01:21:49,184
- We're shallower on the draught, right?
- Aye.

870
01:21:49,284 --> 01:21:51,611
Well, then can't we lose them
amongst those shoals?

871
01:21:53,413 --> 01:21:55,941
We don't have to outrun them long.
Just long enough.

872
01:21:56,041 --> 01:21:58,610
Lighten the ship. Stem to stern.

873
01:21:58,710 --> 01:22:01,830
Anything we can afford to lose,
see that it's lost.

874
01:22:11,390 --> 01:22:13,884
Apparently, there's a leak.

875
01:22:27,948 --> 01:22:31,727
Haul on the main brace!
Make ready the guns!

876
01:22:31,827 --> 01:22:34,396
Run out the sweeps.

877
01:22:34,496 --> 01:22:36,865
Heave, ho!

878
01:23:01,481 --> 01:23:03,809
We're gonna need that.

879
01:23:11,742 --> 01:23:17,940
- It was a good plan up till now.
- Gibbs, we have to make a stand.

880
01:23:18,040 --> 01:23:21,151
We must fight. Load the guns.

881
01:23:21,251 --> 01:23:24,404
- With what?
- Anything. Everything.

882
01:23:24,504 --> 01:23:25,872
Anything we have left.

883
01:23:27,925 --> 01:23:29,785
Load the guns!

884
01:23:29,885 --> 01:23:33,338
Case shot and langrage.
Nails and crushed glass.

885
01:23:35,807 --> 01:23:37,092
With a Will!

886
01:23:58,622 --> 01:24:00,858
The Pearl's gonna luff up
on our port quarter.

887
01:24:00,958 --> 01:24:03,735
She'll rake us
without ever presenting a target.

888
01:24:03,835 --> 01:24:05,996
Lower the anchor on the right side.

889
01:24:06,588 --> 01:24:10,450
- On the starboard side.
- It certainly has the element of surprise.

890
01:24:10,550 --> 01:24:14,671
- You're daft, lady. You both are.
- Daft like Jack.

891
01:24:15,180 --> 01:24:16,548
Lower the starboard anchor!

892
01:24:17,474 --> 01:24:20,335
Do it, you gobs,
or it's you we'll load into the cannons.

893
01:24:20,435 --> 01:24:22,721
Starboard anchor, lower away.

894
01:24:39,538 --> 01:24:40,780
Let go!

895
01:24:47,295 --> 01:24:51,783
They're club hauling.
Hard a port. Rack the starboard oars.

896
01:24:51,883 --> 01:24:54,211
- Hard a port.
- Starboard oars.

897
01:25:05,063 --> 01:25:07,515
Keep her steady, man.

898
01:25:13,822 --> 01:25:15,432
- Now!
- Fire!

899
01:25:15,532 --> 01:25:16,816
Fire all!

900
01:25:26,251 --> 01:25:28,620
Stop blowing holes in my ship.

901
01:26:02,204 --> 01:26:04,864
- Fire!
- Fire!

902
01:26:15,008 --> 01:26:18,870
- We could use a few more ideas, lass.
- Your turn.

903
01:26:18,970 --> 01:26:22,215
- We need us a devil's dowry.
- We'll give them her.

904
01:26:23,266 --> 01:26:24,718
She's not what they're after.

905
01:26:27,104 --> 01:26:28,638
The medallion.

906
01:26:50,669 --> 01:26:53,330
Strike your colours,
you blooming cockroaches.

907
01:26:53,588 --> 01:26:58,543
Hands, grapnels at the ready.
Prepare to board.

908
01:27:32,252 --> 01:27:35,072
Pistols and cutlasses, men.

909
01:27:35,172 --> 01:27:36,998
Koehler, Twigg.
To the powder magazine!

910
01:27:37,257 --> 01:27:40,877
And the rest of you,
bring me the medallion!

911
01:27:50,228 --> 01:27:53,556
Hey! Hey!

912
01:28:08,747 --> 01:28:11,366
Hey! Below!

913
01:28:31,394 --> 01:28:32,637
Thanks very much.

914
01:28:45,951 --> 01:28:47,902
Jack!

915
01:28:48,286 --> 01:28:50,155
Bloody empty-

916
01:29:06,096 --> 01:29:07,380
That's not very nice.

917
01:29:12,769 --> 01:29:14,929
- Where's the medallion?
- Wretch!

918
01:29:18,108 --> 01:29:19,350
Where is dear William?

919
01:29:21,361 --> 01:29:22,770
Will.

920
01:29:24,990 --> 01:29:27,233
- Will.
- Elizabeth.

921
01:29:30,453 --> 01:29:32,280
Monkey.

922
01:29:38,211 --> 01:29:39,696
I can't move it.

923
01:29:39,796 --> 01:29:42,032
- Come on, you.
- No! Will!

924
01:29:42,132 --> 01:29:45,793
- Elizabeth!
- Will!

925
01:29:55,603 --> 01:29:57,764
Why, thank you, Jack.

926
01:29:58,064 --> 01:30:02,101
- You're welcome.
- Not you. We named the monkey Jack.

927
01:30:03,194 --> 01:30:06,272
Gents, our hope is restored.

928
01:30:42,776 --> 01:30:46,137
If any of you so much as thinks
the word parley,

929
01:30:46,237 --> 01:30:49,107
I'll have your guts for garters.

930
01:30:56,831 --> 01:30:58,733
Will.

931
01:30:58,833 --> 01:31:03,196
- You godless savage!
- Welcome back, miss.

932
01:31:03,296 --> 01:31:05,991
You took advantage
of our hospitality last time.

933
01:31:06,091 --> 01:31:09,877
It holds fair now you return the favour.

934
01:31:15,266 --> 01:31:16,551
Barbossa.

935
01:31:18,478 --> 01:31:20,388
Will.

936
01:31:22,273 --> 01:31:26,144
- She goes free.
- What's in your head, boy?

937
01:31:27,445 --> 01:31:28,813
She goes free.

938
01:31:29,280 --> 01:31:32,066
You've only got one shot,
and we can't die.

939
01:31:33,118 --> 01:31:34,611
Don't do anything stupid.

940
01:31:37,580 --> 01:31:38,823
You can't.

941
01:31:39,374 --> 01:31:41,326
I can.

942
01:31:42,210 --> 01:31:43,661
Like that.

943
01:31:44,546 --> 01:31:45,997
Who are you?

944
01:31:46,548 --> 01:31:48,241
No one. He's no one.

945
01:31:48,341 --> 01:31:51,453
A distant cousin
of my aunt's nephew twice removed.

946
01:31:51,553 --> 01:31:53,705
Lovely singing voice, though. Eunuch.

947
01:31:53,805 --> 01:31:58,209
My name is Will Turner.
My father was Bootstrap Bill Turner.

948
01:31:58,309 --> 01:32:00,879
His blood runs in my veins.

949
01:32:00,979 --> 01:32:03,348
He's the spitting image
of old Bootstrap Bill,

950
01:32:03,690 --> 01:32:05,133
come back to haunt us.

951
01:32:05,233 --> 01:32:07,310
On my word, do as I say

952
01:32:07,777 --> 01:32:11,522
or I'll pull this trigger
and be lost to Davy Jones' locker.

953
01:32:12,490 --> 01:32:14,726
Name your terms, Mr. Turner.

954
01:32:14,826 --> 01:32:18,821
- Elizabeth goes free.
- Yes, we know that one. Anything else?

955
01:32:22,083 --> 01:32:25,787
And the crew.
The crew are not to be harmed.

956
01:32:29,674 --> 01:32:31,334
Agreed.

957
01:32:37,515 --> 01:32:40,835
Go on, poppet. Walk the plank.

958
01:32:40,935 --> 01:32:44,430
Go. Go on, then.

959
01:32:50,487 --> 01:32:52,230
Barbossa, you lying bastard.

960
01:32:52,530 --> 01:32:56,567
- You swore she'd go free.
- Don't dare impugn me honour, boy.

961
01:32:57,744 --> 01:32:58,853
I agreed she'd go free,

962
01:32:58,953 --> 01:33:02,115
but it was you who failed to specify
when or where.

963
01:33:08,046 --> 01:33:12,792
Though it does seem a shame
to lose something so fine, don't it, lads?

964
01:33:13,551 --> 01:33:17,004
So I'll be having that dress back
before you go.

965
01:33:21,142 --> 01:33:23,469
I always liked you.

966
01:33:26,439 --> 01:33:28,808
It goes with your black heart.

967
01:33:30,026 --> 01:33:31,519
It's still warm.

968
01:33:34,739 --> 01:33:36,941
Off you go.

969
01:33:37,283 --> 01:33:38,860
Come on.

970
01:33:42,288 --> 01:33:43,531
Too long.

971
01:33:54,217 --> 01:33:57,837
I'd really rather hoped
we were past all this.

972
01:33:58,221 --> 01:34:01,883
Jack. Jack.

973
01:34:02,600 --> 01:34:04,135
Did you not notice?

974
01:34:04,352 --> 01:34:06,838
That be the same little island
that we made you governor of

975
01:34:06,938 --> 01:34:09,599
on our last little trip.

976
01:34:10,066 --> 01:34:11,301
I did notice.

977
01:34:11,401 --> 01:34:15,638
Perhaps you'll be able to conjure up
another miraculous escape.

978
01:34:15,738 --> 01:34:18,024
But I doubt it.

979
01:34:20,076 --> 01:34:21,736
Off you go.

980
01:34:22,912 --> 01:34:25,364
Last time you left me
a pistol with one shot.

981
01:34:25,582 --> 01:34:29,068
By the powers, you're right.
Where be Jack's pistol?

982
01:34:29,168 --> 01:34:31,579
Bring it forward.

983
01:34:34,007 --> 01:34:38,786
Seeing as there's two of us, a gentleman
would give us a pair of pistols.

984
01:34:38,886 --> 01:34:42,040
It'll be one pistol as before,
and you can be the gentleman

985
01:34:42,140 --> 01:34:45,510
and shoot the lady
and starve to death yourself.

986
01:35:09,751 --> 01:35:13,454
That's the second time I've had to watch
that man sail away with my ship.

987
01:35:15,965 --> 01:35:18,368
But you were marooned
on this island before, weren't you?

988
01:35:18,468 --> 01:35:20,036
We can escape the same way you did.

989
01:35:20,136 --> 01:35:23,039
To what point and purpose,
young Missy?

990
01:35:23,139 --> 01:35:25,041
The Black Pearl is gone.

991
01:35:25,141 --> 01:35:28,795
And unless you have a rudder
and a lot of sails hidden in that bodice--

992
01:35:28,895 --> 01:35:30,797
Unlikely.

993
01:35:30,897 --> 01:35:33,850
--Young Mr. Turner will be dead
long before you can reach him.

994
01:35:36,819 --> 01:35:38,896
But you're Captain Jack Sparrow.

995
01:35:39,280 --> 01:35:43,226
You vanished from under the eyes of
seven agents of the East India Company.

996
01:35:43,326 --> 01:35:46,020
You sacked Nassau port
without even firing a shot.

997
01:35:46,120 --> 01:35:49,657
Are you the pirate I've read about
or not?

998
01:35:50,917 --> 01:35:52,952
How did you escape last time?

999
01:35:59,550 --> 01:36:04,088
Last time I was here a grand total
of three days, all right?

1000
01:36:05,181 --> 01:36:07,383
Last time

1001
01:36:08,226 --> 01:36:11,921
the rumrunners who used this island
as a cache came by,

1002
01:36:12,021 --> 01:36:14,424
and I was able to barter passage off.

1003
01:36:14,524 --> 01:36:17,310
From the looks of things,
they've long been out of business.

1004
01:36:18,027 --> 01:36:23,099
Probably have your bloody friend
Norrington to thank for that.

1005
01:36:23,199 --> 01:36:25,735
So that's it, then?

1006
01:36:25,952 --> 01:36:30,732
That's the secret grand adventure
of the infamous Jack Sparrow?

1007
01:36:30,832 --> 01:36:35,161
You spent three days lying on a beach
drinking rum.

1008
01:36:38,005 --> 01:36:40,917
Welcome to the Caribbean, love.

1009
01:36:49,225 --> 01:36:52,378
We're devils, we're black sheep
We're really bad eggs

1010
01:36:52,478 --> 01:36:55,298
Drink up, me hearties, yo ho

1011
01:36:55,398 --> 01:36:57,425
Yo ho, yo ho

1012
01:36:57,525 --> 01:36:59,177
A pirate's life for me

1013
01:36:59,277 --> 01:37:01,354
I love this song.

1014
01:37:04,490 --> 01:37:07,652
Really bad egg.

1015
01:37:11,289 --> 01:37:13,149
When I get the Pearl back

1016
01:37:13,249 --> 01:37:17,236
I'm gonna teach it to the whole crew
and we'll sing it all the time.

1017
01:37:17,336 --> 01:37:21,324
And you will be positively the most
fearsome pirates in the Spanish Main.

1018
01:37:21,424 --> 01:37:25,953
Not just the Spanish Main, love
The entire ocean.

1019
01:37:26,053 --> 01:37:27,922
The entire world.

1020
01:37:28,806 --> 01:37:32,335
Wherever we want to go, we go.
That's what a ship is, you know.

1021
01:37:32,435 --> 01:37:35,213
It's not just a keel and a hull
and a deck and sails.

1022
01:37:35,313 --> 01:37:36,931
That's what a ship needs.

1023
01:37:37,398 --> 01:37:39,892
But what a ship is--

1024
01:37:40,276 --> 01:37:44,397
What the Black Pearl really is

1025
01:37:44,781 --> 01:37:47,024
is freedom.

1026
01:37:48,868 --> 01:37:50,152
Jack.

1027
01:37:51,287 --> 01:37:55,483
It must be really terrible for you
to be trapped on this island.

1028
01:37:55,583 --> 01:37:56,951
Oh, yes.

1029
01:37:57,335 --> 01:38:03,040
But the company is infinitely better
than last time,

1030
01:38:04,342 --> 01:38:06,536
and the scenery
has definitely improved.

1031
01:38:06,636 --> 01:38:10,707
Mr. Sparrow, I'm not entirely sure
that I've had enough rum

1032
01:38:10,807 --> 01:38:12,299
to allow that kind of talk.

1033
01:38:13,893 --> 01:38:17,013
I know exactly what you mean, love.

1034
01:38:23,277 --> 01:38:24,812
To freedom.

1035
01:38:27,448 --> 01:38:29,817
To the Black Pearl.

1036
01:38:58,771 --> 01:39:03,718
No. Not good. Stop. Not good.

1037
01:39:03,818 --> 01:39:04,927
What are you doing?

1038
01:39:05,027 --> 01:39:07,722
You burned all the food,
the shade, the rum.

1039
01:39:07,822 --> 01:39:10,691
- Yes, the rum is gone.
- Why is the rum gone?

1040
01:39:11,158 --> 01:39:12,935
One, because it is a vile drink

1041
01:39:13,035 --> 01:39:15,855
that turns even the most respectable men
into complete scoundrels.

1042
01:39:15,955 --> 01:39:19,150
Two, that signal
is over a thousand feet high.

1043
01:39:19,250 --> 01:39:21,235
The entire Royal Navy
is out looking for me.

1044
01:39:21,335 --> 01:39:23,821
Do you really think that there
is even the slightest chance

1045
01:39:23,921 --> 01:39:27,083
- that they won't see it?
- But why is the rum gone?

1046
01:39:28,009 --> 01:39:29,585
Just wait, Captain Sparrow.

1047
01:39:30,011 --> 01:39:32,413
You give it one hour, maybe two,
keep a weather eye open,

1048
01:39:32,513 --> 01:39:35,966
and you will see white sails
on that horizon.

1049
01:39:42,231 --> 01:39:44,801
"It must have been terrible for you
to be trapped here, Jack.

1050
01:39:44,901 --> 01:39:48,979
Must have been terrible for you--"
Well, it bloody is now!

1051
01:39:55,536 --> 01:39:58,572
There'll be no living with her after this.

1052
01:39:58,831 --> 01:40:00,699
- But we've got to save Will.
- No.

1053
01:40:00,958 --> 01:40:02,401
You're safe now.

1054
01:40:02,501 --> 01:40:06,239
We will return to Port Royal immediately,
not go gallivanting after pirates.

1055
01:40:06,339 --> 01:40:07,748
Then we condemn him to death.

1056
01:40:09,508 --> 01:40:11,293
The boy's fate is regrettable.

1057
01:40:12,470 --> 01:40:14,914
But then, so was his decision
to engage in piracy.

1058
01:40:15,014 --> 01:40:18,342
To rescue me. To prevent anything
from happening to me.

1059
01:40:18,809 --> 01:40:22,505
If I may be so bold as to interject
my professional opinion,

1060
01:40:22,605 --> 01:40:25,341
the Pearl was listing near to scuppers
after the battle.

1061
01:40:25,441 --> 01:40:28,477
It's very unlikely
she'll be able to make good time.

1062
01:40:28,653 --> 01:40:32,265
Think about it. The Black Pearl.

1063
01:40:32,365 --> 01:40:36,727
The last real pirate threat
in the Caribbean, mate.

1064
01:40:36,827 --> 01:40:39,780
How can you pass that up, eh?

1065
01:40:40,831 --> 01:40:45,111
By remembering that I serve others
Mr. Sparrow, not only myself.

1066
01:40:45,211 --> 01:40:48,865
Commodore, I beg you, please do this.
For me.

1067
01:40:48,965 --> 01:40:51,250
As a wedding gift.

1068
01:40:51,550 --> 01:40:56,088
Elizabeth. Are you accepting
the commodore's proposal?

1069
01:40:58,724 --> 01:41:00,050
I am.

1070
01:41:00,434 --> 01:41:03,929
A wedding. I love weddings.
Drinks all around.

1071
01:41:06,107 --> 01:41:08,976
I know. Clap him in irons, right?

1072
01:41:11,404 --> 01:41:13,731
Mr. Sparrow,

1073
01:41:13,906 --> 01:41:15,808
you will accompany
these fine men to the helm

1074
01:41:15,908 --> 01:41:18,152
and provide us with a bearing
to Isla de Muerta.

1075
01:41:19,078 --> 01:41:22,273
You'll then spend the rest of the voyage
contemplating all possible meanings

1076
01:41:22,373 --> 01:41:27,036
of the phrase "silent as the grave."
Do I make myself clear?

1077
01:41:27,461 --> 01:41:30,289
Inescapably clear.

1078
01:41:34,135 --> 01:41:37,838
- Shiver me timbers.
- Cotton here says you missed a bit.

1079
01:41:42,810 --> 01:41:44,220
You knew William Turner?

1080
01:41:45,938 --> 01:41:49,225
Old Bootstrap Bill. We knew him.

1081
01:41:50,317 --> 01:41:54,347
Never sat well with Bootstrap
what we did to Jack Sparrow.

1082
01:41:54,447 --> 01:41:56,849
The mutiny and all.

1083
01:41:56,949 --> 01:41:58,984
He said it wasn't right with the Code.

1084
01:41:59,994 --> 01:42:03,239
That's why he sent off a piece
of the treasure to you, as it were.

1085
01:42:04,707 --> 01:42:08,118
He said we deserved to be cursed

1086
01:42:08,419 --> 01:42:10,446
and remain cursed.

1087
01:42:10,546 --> 01:42:13,582
- Stupid blighter.
- Good man.

1088
01:42:14,050 --> 01:42:15,459
But, as you can imagine,

1089
01:42:16,302 --> 01:42:19,163
that didn't sit too well with the captain.

1090
01:42:19,263 --> 01:42:22,249
That didn't sit too well
with the captain at all.

1091
01:42:22,349 --> 01:42:25,928
- Tell him what Barbossa did.
- I'm telling the story.

1092
01:42:28,397 --> 01:42:32,426
So, what the captain did,

1093
01:42:32,526 --> 01:42:34,971
he strapped a cannon
to Bootstrap's bootstraps.

1094
01:42:35,071 --> 01:42:39,767
- Bootstrap's bootstraps.
- The last we saw of old Bill Turner

1095
01:42:39,867 --> 01:42:45,614
he was sinking to the crushing black
oblivion of Davy Jones' locker.

1096
01:42:46,248 --> 01:42:47,733
Of course, it was only after that,

1097
01:42:47,833 --> 01:42:50,903
we learned we needed his blood
to lift the curse.

1098
01:42:51,003 --> 01:42:54,039
That's what you call ironic.

1099
01:42:58,177 --> 01:43:00,087
Bring him.

1100
01:43:06,393 --> 01:43:08,470
I don't care for the situation.

1101
01:43:09,105 --> 01:43:12,099
Any attempt to storm the caves
could turn to an ambush.

1102
01:43:12,608 --> 01:43:15,386
Not if you're the one
doing the ambushing.

1103
01:43:15,486 --> 01:43:19,231
I go in and convince Barbossa
to send his men out with their little boats.

1104
01:43:19,865 --> 01:43:21,976
You and your mates
return to the Dauntless

1105
01:43:22,076 --> 01:43:25,312
and blast the bejesus out of them
with your little cannons, aye.

1106
01:43:25,412 --> 01:43:31,493
- What do you have to lose?
- Nothing I'd lament being rid of.

1107
01:43:31,877 --> 01:43:34,447
Now, to be quite honest with you,

1108
01:43:34,547 --> 01:43:36,699
there's still a risk
to those aboard the Dauntless,

1109
01:43:36,799 --> 01:43:40,119
which includes
the future Mrs. Commodore.

1110
01:43:40,219 --> 01:43:41,787
Sorry, but it's for your own safety.

1111
01:43:41,887 --> 01:43:44,707
I don't care what the commodore ordered.
I have to tell him.

1112
01:43:44,807 --> 01:43:47,918
The pirates.
They're cursed, they can't be killed.

1113
01:43:48,018 --> 01:43:50,129
Don't worry, miss,
he's already informed of that.

1114
01:43:50,229 --> 01:43:54,099
A little mermaid flopped up on deck
and told him the whole story.

1115
01:43:54,567 --> 01:43:57,770
This is Jack Sparrow's doing.

1116
01:44:07,955 --> 01:44:12,318
No reason to fret. Just a prick
of the finger. A few drops of blood.

1117
01:44:12,418 --> 01:44:18,707
No mistakes this time.
He's only half Turner. We spill it all.

1118
01:44:19,925 --> 01:44:22,669
Guess there is reason to fret.

1119
01:44:35,649 --> 01:44:37,718
Beg your pardon, beg your pardon.

1120
01:44:37,818 --> 01:44:39,595
- Begun by blood.
- Excuse me.

1121
01:44:39,695 --> 01:44:42,564
By blood and--

1122
01:44:45,117 --> 01:44:46,727
Jack.

1123
01:44:46,827 --> 01:44:50,239
- It's not possible.
- Not probable.

1124
01:44:50,789 --> 01:44:52,074
Where's Elizabeth?

1125
01:44:53,292 --> 01:44:55,903
She's safe, just like I promised.

1126
01:44:56,003 --> 01:44:58,705
She's all set to marry Norrington,
just like she promised.

1127
01:44:58,839 --> 01:45:01,125
And you get to die for her,
just like you promised.

1128
01:45:01,467 --> 01:45:03,786
So we're all men of our word, really.

1129
01:45:03,886 --> 01:45:06,580
Except for Elizabeth,
who is, in fact, a woman.

1130
01:45:06,680 --> 01:45:09,216
Shut up. You're next.

1131
01:45:11,644 --> 01:45:17,516
- You don't want to be doing that, mate.
- No, I really think I do.

1132
01:45:18,192 --> 01:45:20,269
Your funeral.

1133
01:45:23,447 --> 01:45:25,399
Why don't I want to be doing it?

1134
01:45:25,908 --> 01:45:27,935
Well, because--

1135
01:45:28,035 --> 01:45:32,898
Because the HMS Dauntless,
pride of the Royal Navy,

1136
01:45:32,998 --> 01:45:38,245
is floating just offshore, waiting for you.

1137
01:45:46,178 --> 01:45:48,297
What we doing here?

1138
01:45:49,223 --> 01:45:53,252
The pirates come out,
unprepared and unawares.

1139
01:45:53,352 --> 01:45:58,724
We catch them in a crossfire,
send them down to see Old Hob.

1140
01:45:58,857 --> 01:46:00,467
I know why we're here.

1141
01:46:00,567 --> 01:46:05,639
I meant, why aren't we doing what it was
what Mr. Sparrow said we should do?

1142
01:46:05,739 --> 01:46:10,569
- With the cannons and all?
- Because it was Mr. Sparrow who said it.

1143
01:46:12,746 --> 01:46:15,107
You think he wasn't telling the truth?

1144
01:46:15,207 --> 01:46:18,027
Just hear me out, mate.

1145
01:46:18,127 --> 01:46:20,954
Order your men to the Dauntless.
They do what they do best.

1146
01:46:21,922 --> 01:46:26,577
Robert's your uncle, Fannie's your aunt.
There you are with two ships.

1147
01:46:26,677 --> 01:46:29,046
The makings of your very own fleet.

1148
01:46:29,346 --> 01:46:32,583
Of course, you'll take the grandest
as your flagship, and who's to argue?

1149
01:46:32,683 --> 01:46:35,219
But what of the Pearl?

1150
01:46:35,853 --> 01:46:37,546
Name me captain.

1151
01:46:37,646 --> 01:46:40,716
I'll sail under your colours,
I'll give you 10 percent of me plunder,

1152
01:46:40,816 --> 01:46:46,388
and you get to introduce yourself
as Commodore Barbossa.

1153
01:46:46,488 --> 01:46:49,266
- Savvy?
- I suppose in exchange,

1154
01:46:49,366 --> 01:46:52,519
- you want me not to kill the whelp.
- No, no, no. Not at all.

1155
01:46:52,619 --> 01:46:54,363
By all means, kill the whelp.

1156
01:46:54,538 --> 01:47:01,745
Just not yet. Wait to lift the curse
until the opportune moment.

1157
01:47:05,132 --> 01:47:07,209
For instance,

1158
01:47:08,469 --> 01:47:11,630
after you've killed Norrington's men.

1159
01:47:12,222 --> 01:47:16,885
Every last one.

1160
01:47:26,570 --> 01:47:28,889
You've been planning this
from the beginning.

1161
01:47:28,989 --> 01:47:32,317
- Ever since you learned my name.
- Yeah.

1162
01:47:34,536 --> 01:47:36,313
I want 50 percent of your plunder.

1163
01:47:36,413 --> 01:47:37,731
- Fifteen.
- Forty.

1164
01:47:37,831 --> 01:47:39,858
Twenty-five.

1165
01:47:39,958 --> 01:47:41,368
I'll buy you the hat.

1166
01:47:41,752 --> 01:47:43,453
A really big one,

1167
01:47:44,129 --> 01:47:45,372
commodore.

1168
01:47:48,300 --> 01:47:50,919
We have an accord.

1169
01:47:51,595 --> 01:47:53,714
All hands to the boats.

1170
01:47:54,598 --> 01:47:57,593
Apologies. You give the orders.

1171
01:47:58,894 --> 01:48:00,838
Gents,

1172
01:48:00,938 --> 01:48:02,931
take a walk.

1173
01:48:07,444 --> 01:48:08,687
Not to the boats?

1174
01:49:07,921 --> 01:49:10,082
Hold fire.

1175
01:49:12,634 --> 01:49:16,588
Oh, this is just like what the Greeks done
at Troy.

1176
01:49:16,847 --> 01:49:20,133
Except they was in a horse
instead of dresses.

1177
01:49:20,684 --> 01:49:22,219
Wooden horse.

1178
01:49:35,115 --> 01:49:37,234
A moment, please.

1179
01:49:40,245 --> 01:49:42,072
Elizabeth.

1180
01:49:44,666 --> 01:49:46,410
I just want you to know, I--

1181
01:49:47,419 --> 01:49:50,656
I believe you made
a very good decision today.

1182
01:49:50,756 --> 01:49:53,333
Couldn't be more proud of you.

1183
01:49:53,509 --> 01:49:57,287
But you know, even a good decision,
if made for the wrong reasons,

1184
01:49:57,387 --> 01:49:59,089
can be a wrong decision.

1185
01:50:06,230 --> 01:50:09,891
- Look into that, will you? Report back.
- Lieutenant?

1186
01:50:28,168 --> 01:50:30,328
Elizabeth.

1187
01:50:31,505 --> 01:50:33,498
Are you there?

1188
01:50:35,133 --> 01:50:37,711
Elizabeth, are you even listening to me?

1189
01:51:03,996 --> 01:51:06,907
Oh, what have you done?

1190
01:51:07,666 --> 01:51:10,535
Stop that. Already feel like a fool.

1191
01:51:11,545 --> 01:51:13,789
Look nice, though.

1192
01:51:17,301 --> 01:51:18,835
I look nice?

1193
01:51:55,589 --> 01:51:58,951
I must admit, Jack,
I thought I had you figured.

1194
01:51:59,051 --> 01:52:02,120
But it turns out
you're a hard man to predict.

1195
01:52:02,220 --> 01:52:04,206
Me? I'm dishonest.

1196
01:52:04,306 --> 01:52:07,417
And a dishonest man
you can always trust to be dishonest.

1197
01:52:07,517 --> 01:52:11,304
Honestly. It's the honest ones
you want to watch out for,

1198
01:52:11,563 --> 01:52:13,590
because you can never predict

1199
01:52:13,690 --> 01:52:17,936
when they're gonna do something
incredibly stupid.

1200
01:52:51,186 --> 01:52:55,557
You're off the edge of the map, mate.
Here there be monsters.

1201
01:53:00,237 --> 01:53:02,272
Right.

1202
01:53:03,240 --> 01:53:07,311
- What would you pick to eat first?
- I think we should decide now.

1203
01:53:07,411 --> 01:53:09,696
Just so we're ready
when the time comes.

1204
01:53:34,938 --> 01:53:36,973
What was that?

1205
01:53:58,795 --> 01:54:00,747
Miss Elizabeth.

1206
01:54:20,400 --> 01:54:22,143
Make for the ship. Move.

1207
01:54:31,495 --> 01:54:33,405
To the ship!

1208
01:54:36,082 --> 01:54:38,159
Row, men.

1209
01:55:15,580 --> 01:55:17,532
You can't beat me, Jack.

1210
01:55:41,773 --> 01:55:43,308
That's interesting.

1211
01:55:54,119 --> 01:55:56,112
I couldn't resist, mate.

1212
01:57:02,395 --> 01:57:03,680
Sorry.

1213
01:57:12,656 --> 01:57:14,140
So, what now, Jack Sparrow?

1214
01:57:14,240 --> 01:57:16,935
Are we to be two immortals
locked in an epic battle

1215
01:57:17,035 --> 01:57:20,522
until judgment day
and the trumpets sound?

1216
01:57:20,622 --> 01:57:22,824
Or you could surrender.

1217
01:57:49,150 --> 01:57:52,470
All of you with me.
Will is in that cave and we must save him.

1218
01:57:52,570 --> 01:57:56,482
Ready. And heave.

1219
01:58:01,955 --> 01:58:04,073
Please, I need your help. Come on.

1220
01:58:04,791 --> 01:58:08,620
- Any port in a storm.
- Cotton's right. We've got the Pearl.

1221
01:58:09,337 --> 01:58:11,239
What about Jack?
Are you just gonna leave him?

1222
01:58:11,339 --> 01:58:14,876
- Jack owes us a ship.
- And there's the Code to consider.

1223
01:58:15,343 --> 01:58:17,295
The Code?

1224
01:58:18,722 --> 01:58:22,508
You're pirates.
Hang the Code and hang the rules.

1225
01:58:22,767 --> 01:58:25,011
They're more like guidelines anyway.

1226
01:58:28,732 --> 01:58:30,975
Bloody pirates.

1227
01:58:41,411 --> 01:58:44,397
- What?
- Is it supposed to be doing that?

1228
01:58:44,497 --> 01:58:48,993
- They're stealing our ship.
- Bloody pirates.

1229
01:58:51,337 --> 01:58:52,872
Boarders away.

1230
01:59:01,056 --> 01:59:04,175
Come on!

1231
01:59:29,459 --> 01:59:31,119
Me eye.

1232
01:59:50,188 --> 01:59:54,058
- I'm gonna teach you the meaning of pain.
- Do you like pain?

1233
01:59:55,652 --> 01:59:57,228
Try wearing a corset.

1234
02:00:07,705 --> 02:00:11,993
- Whose side is Jack on?
- At the moment?

1235
02:00:47,328 --> 02:00:49,364
No fair.

1236
02:01:12,228 --> 02:01:17,550
Ten years you carry that pistol,
and now you waste your shot.

1237
02:01:17,650 --> 02:01:20,061
He didn't waste it.

1238
02:01:45,345 --> 02:01:47,463
I feel...

1239
02:01:51,351 --> 02:01:53,386
cold.

1240
02:02:54,831 --> 02:02:56,991
Parley?

1241
02:02:57,667 --> 02:02:59,952
The ship is ours, gentlemen.

1242
02:03:47,717 --> 02:03:50,002
We should return to the Dauntless.

1243
02:03:52,430 --> 02:03:56,050
Your fiancé will be wanting to know
you're safe.

1244
02:04:05,693 --> 02:04:09,355
If you were waiting
for the opportune moment...

1245
02:04:09,947 --> 02:04:12,024
that was it.

1246
02:04:12,909 --> 02:04:14,102
Now, if you'd be so kind,

1247
02:04:14,202 --> 02:04:17,905
I'd be much obliged
if you'd drop me off at my ship.

1248
02:04:22,502 --> 02:04:24,787
I'm sorry, Jack.

1249
02:04:26,714 --> 02:04:30,793
They done what's right by them.
Can't expect more than that.

1250
02:04:46,401 --> 02:04:49,262
"Jack Sparrow, be it known
that you have been charged..."

1251
02:04:49,362 --> 02:04:51,897
Captain. Captain Jack Sparrow.

1252
02:04:52,407 --> 02:04:55,860
"For your wilful commission
of crimes against the Crown.

1253
02:04:56,911 --> 02:05:01,983
Said crimes being numerous in quantity
and sinister in nature.

1254
02:05:02,083 --> 02:05:05,653
The most egregious of these
to be cited herewith.

1255
02:05:05,753 --> 02:05:09,498
- Piracy, smuggling..."
- This is wrong.

1256
02:05:10,842 --> 02:05:13,411
Commodore Norrington
is bound by the law.

1257
02:05:13,511 --> 02:05:15,997
As are we all.

1258
02:05:16,097 --> 02:05:18,883
"Impersonating an officer
of the Spanish Royal Navy.

1259
02:05:19,100 --> 02:05:21,919
Impersonating a cleric
of the Church of England..."

1260
02:05:22,019 --> 02:05:25,298
- Oh, yeah.
- "...sailing under false colours,

1261
02:05:25,398 --> 02:05:29,602
arson, kidnapping, looting, poaching,

1262
02:05:29,902 --> 02:05:37,443
brigandage, pilfering, depravity,
depredation, and general lawlessness.

1263
02:05:38,786 --> 02:05:41,356
And for these crimes,
you have been sentenced to be,

1264
02:05:41,456 --> 02:05:46,702
on this day,
hung by the neck until dead.

1265
02:05:47,044 --> 02:05:49,405
May God have mercy on your soul."

1266
02:05:49,505 --> 02:05:50,873
Governor Swann.

1267
02:05:51,632 --> 02:05:52,875
Commodore.

1268
02:05:54,510 --> 02:05:56,379
Elizabeth.

1269
02:05:57,013 --> 02:05:59,632
I should have told you every day
from the moment I met you.

1270
02:06:02,727 --> 02:06:03,969
I love you.

1271
02:06:18,951 --> 02:06:20,319
Watch yourself.

1272
02:06:20,912 --> 02:06:23,072
- Marines.
- I can't breathe.

1273
02:06:25,208 --> 02:06:27,159
Elizabeth.

1274
02:06:28,878 --> 02:06:30,871
Move.

1275
02:06:40,848 --> 02:06:43,134
- You men, quickly!
- What?

1276
02:06:54,320 --> 02:06:56,021
Move.

1277
02:07:05,248 --> 02:07:06,907
Come on.

1278
02:07:15,216 --> 02:07:16,325
Come on!

1279
02:07:16,425 --> 02:07:18,127
- Right, right.
- Come on, lads.

1280
02:07:43,452 --> 02:07:44,854
I thought we might have to endure

1281
02:07:44,954 --> 02:07:48,491
some manner
of ill-conceived escape attempt.

1282
02:07:48,666 --> 02:07:50,067
But not from you.

1283
02:07:50,167 --> 02:07:53,863
On our return to Port Royal,
I granted you clemency.

1284
02:07:53,963 --> 02:07:57,917
And this is how you thank me?
By throwing in your lot with him?

1285
02:07:58,593 --> 02:08:01,587
- He's a pirate.
- And a good man.

1286
02:08:02,847 --> 02:08:04,916
If all I've achieved here
is the hangman will earn

1287
02:08:05,016 --> 02:08:08,419
two pairs of boots
instead of one, so be it.

1288
02:08:08,519 --> 02:08:13,474
- At least my conscience will be clear.
- You forget your place, Turner.

1289
02:08:15,026 --> 02:08:18,103
It's right here, between you and Jack.

1290
02:08:22,867 --> 02:08:25,277
- As is mine.
- Elizabeth.

1291
02:08:26,621 --> 02:08:28,739
Lower your weapons.

1292
02:08:29,040 --> 02:08:30,699
For goodness' sake, put them down.

1293
02:08:35,796 --> 02:08:38,707
So this is where
your heart truly lies, then?

1294
02:08:40,301 --> 02:08:41,877
It is.

1295
02:08:50,519 --> 02:08:54,173
Well, I'm actually feeling
rather good about this.

1296
02:08:54,273 --> 02:08:56,676
I think we've all arrived
at a special place, eh?

1297
02:08:56,776 --> 02:09:02,189
Spiritually, ecumenically,
grammatically.

1298
02:09:02,782 --> 02:09:06,527
I want you to know
that I was rooting for you, mate.

1299
02:09:06,661 --> 02:09:08,529
Know that.

1300
02:09:11,874 --> 02:09:13,158
Elizabeth.

1301
02:09:15,461 --> 02:09:17,705
It would never have worked
between us, darling.

1302
02:09:19,674 --> 02:09:21,083
I'm sorry.

1303
02:09:23,260 --> 02:09:25,004
Will.

1304
02:09:26,722 --> 02:09:28,132
Nice hat.

1305
02:09:29,892 --> 02:09:31,677
Friends.

1306
02:09:33,729 --> 02:09:39,059
This is a day that you will
always remember as the day that--

1307
02:09:44,073 --> 02:09:46,692
Idiot. He's nowhere to go
but back to the noose.

1308
02:09:49,036 --> 02:09:50,946
Sail ho!

1309
02:09:58,421 --> 02:10:00,873
What's your plan of action?

1310
02:10:01,757 --> 02:10:03,459
Sir?

1311
02:10:07,263 --> 02:10:09,498
Perhaps on the rare occasion

1312
02:10:09,598 --> 02:10:13,669
pursuing the right course
demands an act of piracy,

1313
02:10:13,769 --> 02:10:18,223
piracy itself can be the right course?

1314
02:10:21,777 --> 02:10:23,062
Mr. Turner.

1315
02:10:29,118 --> 02:10:31,987
I will accept the consequences
of my actions.

1316
02:10:37,793 --> 02:10:40,579
This is a beautiful sword.

1317
02:10:42,131 --> 02:10:45,451
I would expect the man who made it
to show the same care and devotion

1318
02:10:45,551 --> 02:10:48,545
in every aspect of his life.

1319
02:10:50,598 --> 02:10:52,424
Thank you.

1320
02:10:55,102 --> 02:10:58,097
Commodore. What about Sparrow?

1321
02:11:00,024 --> 02:11:04,144
Well, I think we can afford
to give him one day's head start.

1322
02:11:09,492 --> 02:11:11,235
So.

1323
02:11:12,161 --> 02:11:15,322
This is the path you've chosen, is it?

1324
02:11:16,665 --> 02:11:18,659
After all,

1325
02:11:19,210 --> 02:11:20,577
he is a blacksmith.

1326
02:11:21,587 --> 02:11:23,497
No.

1327
02:11:27,760 --> 02:11:29,795
He's a pirate.

1328
02:11:55,120 --> 02:11:57,031
Heave.

1329
02:12:06,215 --> 02:12:08,667
Thought you were supposed to keep
to the Code.

1330
02:12:09,176 --> 02:12:13,422
We figured
they were more actual guidelines.

1331
02:12:17,476 --> 02:12:19,303
Thank you.

1332
02:12:20,187 --> 02:12:22,723
Captain Sparrow.

1333
02:12:25,901 --> 02:12:28,729
The Black Pearl is yours.

1334
02:12:43,335 --> 02:12:46,822
On deck, you scabrous dogs.
Hands to braces.

1335
02:12:46,922 --> 02:12:50,000
Let down and haul to run free.

1336
02:12:50,801 --> 02:12:55,214
Now, bring me that horizon.

1337
02:13:01,729 --> 02:13:04,765
And really bad eggs.

1338
02:13:07,318 --> 02:13:09,603
Drink up, me hearties.
