00:03:54,585 --> 00:03:57,400
Do you have any idea<br/>what they were arguing about?

3
00:03:58,552 --> 00:03:59,927
Do you speak English?

4
00:04:00,184 --> 00:04:00,980
Yeah.

5
00:04:01,176 --> 00:04:03,795
No. I'm sorry,<br/>my German is not very good.

6
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,423
Have you heard that<br/>as couples age...

7
00:04:10,616 --> 00:04:12,983
...they lose their ability<br/>to hear each other?

8
00:04:13,177 --> 00:04:14,125
No.

9
00:04:14,904 --> 00:04:18,679
Supposedly, men lose their ability<br/>to hear high-pitched sounds...

10
00:04:18,872 --> 00:04:20,781
...and women lose hearing<br/>in the low end.

11
00:04:21,688 --> 00:04:23,477
I guess they nullify each other.

12
00:04:23,672 --> 00:04:26,705
I guess. Nature's way of allowing<br/>couples to grow old together...

13
00:04:26,904 --> 00:04:28,692
...without killing each other.

14
00:04:30,744 --> 00:04:32,053
What are you reading?

15
00:04:33,081 --> 00:04:34,324
Oh, yeah.

16
00:04:35,384 --> 00:04:36,278
How about you?

17
00:04:53,463 --> 00:04:56,332
I was thinking about going<br/>to the lounge car.

18
00:04:56,663 --> 00:04:59,446
- Would you like to come with me?<br/>- Yeah.

19
00:05:00,312 --> 00:05:01,556
Okay.

20
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:22,188
How do you speak such good English?

21
00:05:22,391 --> 00:05:24,944
I went to school for a summer<br/>in Los Angeles.

22
00:05:25,463 --> 00:05:27,601
- It's fine here?<br/>- Yeah, this is good.

23
00:05:28,312 --> 00:05:30,646
And I spent some time in London.

24
00:05:31,799 --> 00:05:34,450
- Wow.<br/>- How do you speak such good English?

25
00:05:34,646 --> 00:05:36,239
Me? I'm American.

26
00:05:36,535 --> 00:05:39,382
- You're American? Are you sure?<br/>- Yeah.

27
00:05:40,535 --> 00:05:43,437
No, I'm joking.<br/>I knew you were American.

28
00:05:43,671 --> 00:05:46,158
And you don't speak<br/>any other language, right?

29
00:05:46,807 --> 00:05:48,531
Yeah, yeah.<br/>I get it, I get it.

30
00:05:48,727 --> 00:05:50,832
I'm the crude, dumb,<br/>vulgar American...

31
00:05:51,031 --> 00:05:55,570
...who doesn't speak other languages,<br/>who has no culture. But I tried.

32
00:05:55,766 --> 00:05:59,247
I took French in high school.<br/>When I first got to Paris...

33
00:05:59,446 --> 00:06:01,715
...I stood in line<br/>at the metro station.

34
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:03,055
I was practicing.

35
00:06:07,542 --> 00:06:08,557
Whatever.

36
00:06:12,055 --> 00:06:14,988
And I get up there,<br/>and I look at this woman...

37
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:19,924
...and my mind goes blank. And I say,<br/>"I need a ticket to get to... "

38
00:06:20,118 --> 00:06:21,525
So anyway...

39
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:24,623
So where are you headed?

40
00:06:25,078 --> 00:06:26,801
Well, back to Paris.

41
00:06:26,997 --> 00:06:30,162
- My classes start next week.<br/>- You're still in school? Where?

42
00:06:30,869 --> 00:06:32,363
La Sorbonne. You know?

43
00:06:32,566 --> 00:06:33,580
Sure.

44
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:36,971
You're coming from Budapest?

45
00:06:37,174 --> 00:06:40,076
- I was visiting my grandmother.<br/>- Oh. How is she?

46
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:42,699
She's okay.

47
00:06:42,901 --> 00:06:44,974
- She's all right?<br/>- She's fine.

48
00:06:46,005 --> 00:06:49,137
- How about you? Where are you going?<br/>- I'm going to Vienna.

49
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:50,413
Vienna?<br/>What's there?

50
00:06:50,614 --> 00:06:52,719
No idea.<br/>I'm flying out of there tomorrow.

51
00:06:52,917 --> 00:06:54,412
You're on holiday?

52
00:06:58,293 --> 00:07:00,715
I don't really know what I'm on.<br/>You know?

53
00:07:00,981 --> 00:07:05,039
I've just been traveling around,<br/>riding trains for two or three weeks.

54
00:07:05,237 --> 00:07:08,019
You were visiting friends<br/>or just on your own?

55
00:07:08,725 --> 00:07:10,634
I had a friend in Madrid, but...

56
00:07:10,837 --> 00:07:13,258
- Madrid, that's nice.<br/>- I got a Eurail pass...

57
00:07:13,461 --> 00:07:14,508
...is what I did.

58
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:15,789
That's great.

59
00:07:16,181 --> 00:07:20,371
So has this trip around Europe<br/>been good for you?

60
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:23,347
Yeah, sure. It's been...<br/>It sucked.

61
00:07:23,989 --> 00:07:25,166
What?

62
00:07:27,156 --> 00:07:28,138
It's had its...

63
00:07:28,532 --> 00:07:31,828
I'll tell you, sitting for weeks on end<br/>looking out the window...

64
00:07:32,021 --> 00:07:34,191
...has actually been kind of great.

65
00:07:35,604 --> 00:07:37,098
What do you mean?

66
00:07:38,036 --> 00:07:39,923
Well, you know, for instance...

67
00:07:40,117 --> 00:07:43,412
...you have ideas that you<br/>ordinarily wouldn't have.

68
00:07:43,604 --> 00:07:45,547
- What kind of ideas?<br/>- Want to hear one?

69
00:07:45,748 --> 00:07:47,658
- Tell me.<br/>- All right.

70
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:50,675
I have this idea, okay,<br/>for a television show.

71
00:07:50,868 --> 00:07:53,454
Some friends of mine<br/>are cable-access producers.

72
00:07:53,652 --> 00:07:55,178
Do you know what that is?

73
00:07:56,564 --> 00:08:00,208
Anybody can produce a show real cheap,<br/>and they have to put it on.

74
00:08:00,404 --> 00:08:04,397
I have this idea for a show that lasts<br/>24 hours a day for a year straight.

75
00:08:04,596 --> 00:08:05,773
What you do is you get...

76
00:08:05,971 --> 00:08:10,128
...365 people from cities<br/>all over the world...

77
00:08:10,324 --> 00:08:13,193
...to do these 24-hour documents<br/>of real time.

78
00:08:13,395 --> 00:08:15,883
Capturing life as it's lived.

79
00:08:16,084 --> 00:08:19,880
You know, it would start with a guy<br/>waking up in the morning...

80
00:08:20,084 --> 00:08:22,025
...and taking the long shower...

81
00:08:22,227 --> 00:08:25,805
...eating a little breakfast,<br/>making a little coffee...

82
00:08:26,004 --> 00:08:27,084
...reading the paper...

83
00:08:27,284 --> 00:08:29,258
Wait. All those mundane,<br/>boring things...

84
00:08:29,459 --> 00:08:32,361
...everybody has to do every day<br/>of their fucking life?

85
00:08:32,564 --> 00:08:34,571
I was going to say,<br/>"The poetry of day-to-day life. "

86
00:08:34,771 --> 00:08:37,161
You say it your way.<br/>I'll say it my way.

87
00:08:37,363 --> 00:08:39,272
- Think of it like this...<br/>- Who's gonna watch?

88
00:08:39,475 --> 00:08:43,436
Think about it like this. Why is it<br/>that a dog sleeping in the sun...

89
00:08:43,795 --> 00:08:46,185
...is so beautiful?<br/>It is. It's beautiful.

90
00:08:46,387 --> 00:08:48,874
But a guy taking money<br/>from a bank machine...

91
00:08:49,075 --> 00:08:51,017
...looks like a complete moron?

92
00:08:51,219 --> 00:08:55,246
<i>So it's like a National Geographic<br/>program, but on people.</i>

93
00:08:55,443 --> 00:08:56,239
Yeah.

94
00:08:57,332 --> 00:08:58,193
What do you think?

95
00:08:58,387 --> 00:09:02,097
Yeah, I can see it.<br/>Like, 24 boring hours... Sorry...

96
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:05,607
...and a three-minute sex scene<br/>where he falls asleep right after.

97
00:09:06,898 --> 00:09:09,681
Yeah, and that would<br/>be a great episode.

98
00:09:09,874 --> 00:09:12,176
People would talk about that episode.

99
00:09:12,818 --> 00:09:16,080
You and your friends could<br/>do one in Paris if you wanted.

100
00:09:16,275 --> 00:09:20,879
I don't know. The key, the thing<br/>that haunts me is the distribution.

101
00:09:21,075 --> 00:09:24,850
Getting these tapes from town to town<br/>so it would play continuously.

102
00:09:25,042 --> 00:09:29,515
Because it would have to play all<br/>the time, or it just wouldn't work.

103
00:09:30,323 --> 00:09:31,599
Thank you.

104
00:09:33,074 --> 00:09:34,121
Thanks.

105
00:09:35,793 --> 00:09:38,608
You know what?<br/>Not service oriented.

106
00:09:39,698 --> 00:09:42,415
Just an observation about Europe.

107
00:09:49,937 --> 00:09:53,166
My parents never really<br/>spoke of the possibility...

108
00:09:53,362 --> 00:09:56,777
...of my falling in love or<br/>getting married or having children.

109
00:09:57,233 --> 00:09:59,022
Even as a little girl...

110
00:09:59,218 --> 00:10:02,534
...they wanted me to think as<br/>a future career as a, you know...

111
00:10:02,738 --> 00:10:05,804
...interior designer or lawyer<br/>or something like that.

112
00:10:06,002 --> 00:10:08,686
I'd say to my dad,<br/>"I want to be a writer. "

113
00:10:08,882 --> 00:10:10,540
And he'd say, "Journalist. "

114
00:10:10,738 --> 00:10:15,080
I'd say I wanted to have a refuge for<br/>stray cats. He'd say, "Veterinarian. "

115
00:10:15,282 --> 00:10:18,762
I'd say I wanted to be an actress.<br/>He'd say, "TV newscaster. "

116
00:10:18,962 --> 00:10:22,790
It was this constant conversion<br/>of my fanciful ambition into these...

117
00:10:22,993 --> 00:10:25,229
...practical moneymaking ventures.

118
00:10:26,865 --> 00:10:29,865
I had a good bullshit detector<br/>when I was a kid.

119
00:10:30,065 --> 00:10:32,454
I always knew<br/>when they were lying to me.

120
00:10:32,657 --> 00:10:34,599
By high school, I was dead set...

121
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:38,827
...on listening to what everybody<br/>thought I should do with my life...

122
00:10:39,025 --> 00:10:40,749
...and doing the opposite.

123
00:10:41,809 --> 00:10:46,282
Nobody was ever mean about it.<br/>I just could never get very excited...

124
00:10:46,481 --> 00:10:49,513
...about other people's ambitions<br/>for my life.

125
00:10:49,968 --> 00:10:52,619
But you know what?<br/>If your parents never...

126
00:10:52,816 --> 00:10:56,330
...fully contradict you about anything<br/>and are nice and supportive...

127
00:10:56,528 --> 00:10:57,476
Right.

128
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,650
...it makes it even harder<br/>to officially complain.

129
00:11:00,849 --> 00:11:04,558
Even when they're wrong,<br/>it's this passive-aggressive shit.

130
00:11:04,753 --> 00:11:06,094
You know what I mean?

131
00:11:06,288 --> 00:11:07,499
I hate it.

132
00:11:07,889 --> 00:11:09,415
I really hate it.

133
00:11:09,616 --> 00:11:13,260
Well, you know, despite all that<br/>kind of bullshit...

134
00:11:13,455 --> 00:11:15,049
...that comes along with it...

135
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,284
...I remember childhood as...

136
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,062
...this magical time.

137
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:25,999
I do. I remember when my mother<br/>first told me about death.

138
00:11:26,256 --> 00:11:30,762
My great-grandmother had died, and my<br/>family had visited them in Florida.

139
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,934
I was about 3, 31/2 years old.

140
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:36,430
Anyway, I was in<br/>the back yard playing...

141
00:11:36,624 --> 00:11:40,072
...and my sister had just taught me<br/>how to take the garden hose...

142
00:11:40,272 --> 00:11:42,344
...and do it in such a way that...

143
00:11:43,152 --> 00:11:46,152
...it sprayed into the sun<br/>and would make a rainbow.

144
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,388
And so I was doing that...

145
00:11:49,616 --> 00:11:52,615
...and through the mist,<br/>I could see my grandmother.

146
00:11:52,815 --> 00:11:55,979
And she was just standing there,<br/>smiling at me.

147
00:11:56,176 --> 00:11:59,208
And I held it there for a long time...

148
00:11:59,407 --> 00:12:01,131
...and I looked at her.

149
00:12:01,327 --> 00:12:04,459
And then finally, I let go<br/>of the nozzle, you know?

150
00:12:04,655 --> 00:12:06,543
And then I dropped the hose...

151
00:12:06,831 --> 00:12:08,391
...and she disappeared.

152
00:12:09,263 --> 00:12:11,816
And so I run back inside<br/>and tell my parents.

153
00:12:12,143 --> 00:12:16,333
And they sit me down<br/>and give me this big rap on how...

154
00:12:17,135 --> 00:12:21,413
...when people die, you never see<br/>them again, and how I'd imagined it.

155
00:12:21,614 --> 00:12:24,036
But I knew what I'd seen.<br/>I was glad I saw that.

156
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:28,037
I've never seen anything<br/>like that since. But I don't know.

157
00:12:28,238 --> 00:12:32,134
It just kind of let me know<br/>how ambiguous everything was.

158
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:33,709
Even death.

159
00:12:35,086 --> 00:12:38,186
You're lucky you can have<br/>this attitude toward death.

160
00:12:40,174 --> 00:12:42,858
I think I'm afraid of death<br/>24 hours a day.

161
00:12:43,054 --> 00:12:46,350
I swear. I mean, that's why<br/>I'm in a train right now.

162
00:12:46,543 --> 00:12:49,095
I could've flown to Paris,<br/>but I'm scared.

163
00:12:49,295 --> 00:12:51,499
- Oh, come on.<br/>- I can't help it.

164
00:12:51,694 --> 00:12:54,956
I know the statistics say,<br/>"Na, na, na, it's safer. " Whatever.

165
00:12:55,151 --> 00:12:58,150
When I'm in a plane,<br/>I can see the explosion.

166
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:00,554
I can see me falling<br/>through the clouds.

167
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:04,841
And I'm so scared of those<br/>few seconds of consciousness...

168
00:13:05,038 --> 00:13:08,300
...before you die.<br/>When you know you're gonna die.

169
00:13:11,054 --> 00:13:13,291
I can't stop thinking that way.

170
00:13:13,486 --> 00:13:14,861
It's exhausting.

171
00:13:15,054 --> 00:13:16,548
Yeah, I bet.

172
00:13:16,749 --> 00:13:18,473
Really exhausting.

173
00:13:22,254 --> 00:13:24,587
- I think this is Vienna.<br/>- Yeah.

174
00:13:25,742 --> 00:13:28,458
- You get off here, no?<br/>- Yeah, what a drag.

175
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:32,205
I wish I'd met you earlier.<br/>I really like talking to you.

176
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:34,634
Yeah, me too.

177
00:13:35,374 --> 00:13:37,446
It was really nice of you too.

178
00:14:07,501 --> 00:14:11,112
I have an admittedly insane idea,<br/>but if I don't ask you this...

179
00:14:11,309 --> 00:14:13,250
...it'll haunt me the rest of my life.

180
00:14:13,453 --> 00:14:14,151
What?

181
00:14:17,292 --> 00:14:21,800
I want to keep talking to you.<br/>I have no idea what your situation is...

182
00:14:22,284 --> 00:14:24,619
...but I feel like we have<br/>some kind of...

183
00:14:24,812 --> 00:14:26,187
...connection. Right?

184
00:14:26,412 --> 00:14:27,492
Yeah. Me too.

185
00:14:27,853 --> 00:14:29,642
Right. Great.<br/>Here's the deal.

186
00:14:29,837 --> 00:14:33,098
Get off here in Vienna<br/>and come check out the town.

187
00:14:33,293 --> 00:14:34,885
- What?<br/>- Come on. It'll be fun.

188
00:14:35,277 --> 00:14:36,935
- Come on.<br/>- What would we do?

189
00:14:37,132 --> 00:14:41,540
I don't know. All I know is I catch<br/>a flight tomorrow morning at 9:30...

190
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:44,969
...and I can't afford a hotel,<br/>so I was going to walk around...

191
00:14:45,164 --> 00:14:46,953
...and it'd be more fun<br/>if you came with me.

192
00:14:47,148 --> 00:14:50,726
And if I turn out to be a psycho,<br/>just get on the next train.

193
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:54,023
All right, all right.<br/>Think of it like this.

194
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:57,956
Jump ahead 10, 20 years, okay?

195
00:14:58,155 --> 00:14:59,269
And you're married.

196
00:14:59,468 --> 00:15:03,144
Only your marriage doesn't have<br/>that same energy it used to have.

197
00:15:03,563 --> 00:15:05,254
You start to blame your husband.

198
00:15:05,452 --> 00:15:08,267
You think about all those guys<br/>you've met in your life...

199
00:15:08,459 --> 00:15:11,973
...and what might've happened<br/>if you'd picked up with one of them.

200
00:15:12,172 --> 00:15:14,082
I'm one of those guys.<br/>That's me.

201
00:15:14,283 --> 00:15:16,072
So think of this as time travel...

202
00:15:16,267 --> 00:15:20,042
...from then to now to find out<br/>what you're missing out on.

203
00:15:20,236 --> 00:15:22,439
What this could be is<br/>a gigantic favor...

204
00:15:22,636 --> 00:15:26,117
...to you and your husband to find out<br/>you're not missing anything.

205
00:15:26,316 --> 00:15:29,185
I'm just as big a loser as he is.<br/>Unmotivated. Boring.

206
00:15:29,388 --> 00:15:31,907
You made the right choice.<br/>You're happy.

207
00:15:38,219 --> 00:15:39,910
Let me get my bag.

208
00:16:05,322 --> 00:16:07,527
We should get a locker for all this.

209
00:16:12,362 --> 00:16:13,508
What's your name?

210
00:16:13,707 --> 00:16:14,786
My name?

211
00:16:14,987 --> 00:16:18,370
Jesse. James, actually,<br/>but everybody calls me Jesse.

212
00:16:18,571 --> 00:16:20,643
You mean, Jesse James, no?

213
00:16:20,843 --> 00:16:22,087
No. No, just Jesse.

214
00:16:22,282 --> 00:16:23,264
I'm Celine.

215
00:16:37,194 --> 00:16:38,754
This is a nice bridge.

216
00:16:38,954 --> 00:16:40,164
Yeah.

217
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:45,857
This is kind of weird.

218
00:16:46,059 --> 00:16:48,676
Isn't it? I mean,<br/>I feel a little awkward.

219
00:16:49,834 --> 00:16:52,517
- But it's all right. Right?<br/>- Yeah, this is great.

220
00:16:52,713 --> 00:16:56,326
- Let's go to some places.<br/>- Yeah, let's go to some places.

221
00:16:56,521 --> 00:16:57,950
- Let's ask these guys.<br/>- Okay.

222
00:16:58,153 --> 00:17:00,423
Excuse me. Excuse me?

223
00:17:00,617 --> 00:17:02,275
<i>Sprechen sie English?</i>

224
00:17:02,474 --> 00:17:05,790
<i>- Ja.  Of course.<br/>- Do you speak German for a change?</i>

225
00:17:05,993 --> 00:17:07,717
- What?<br/>- No, it was a joke.

226
00:17:07,914 --> 00:17:11,558
We just got into Vienna today, and<br/>we're looking for something fun to do.

227
00:17:11,753 --> 00:17:13,411
Like museums, exhibitions...

228
00:17:13,609 --> 00:17:16,905
But museums are not that<br/>funny anymore these days.

229
00:17:17,097 --> 00:17:21,221
They are closing right now.<br/>How long are you going to be here?

230
00:17:21,418 --> 00:17:22,563
Just for tonight.

231
00:17:22,921 --> 00:17:25,768
Why did you come to Vienna?<br/>What could you be expecting?

232
00:17:28,009 --> 00:17:29,798
We're on honeymoon.

233
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:32,959
Yeah, she got pregnant,<br/>we had to get married...

234
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,528
I don't believe you.<br/>You're a bad liar.

235
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:44,999
This is a play we're both in.<br/>We would like to invite you.

236
00:17:45,192 --> 00:17:46,436
You're actors?

237
00:17:46,633 --> 00:17:48,739
Not professional.<br/>Part-time for fun.

238
00:17:48,937 --> 00:17:51,937
It's a play about a cow and<br/>Indians searching for it.

239
00:17:52,137 --> 00:17:54,592
There are also<br/>politicians, Mexicans...

240
00:17:54,793 --> 00:17:56,647
Russians, communists...

241
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:00,641
- You have a real cow on stage?<br/>- No, an actor in a cow costume.

242
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,662
- He's the cow.<br/>- Yes, I am the cow.

243
00:18:02,857 --> 00:18:05,857
- And the cow's a bit weird.<br/>- The cow has a disease.

244
00:18:06,057 --> 00:18:08,358
She's acting a bit strange.<br/>Like a dog.

245
00:18:08,553 --> 00:18:11,072
If someone throws a stick,<br/>she fetches it.

246
00:18:11,272 --> 00:18:14,370
And she can smoke with hoofs<br/>and everything.

247
00:18:14,888 --> 00:18:17,276
- Great.<br/>- As you see, there is the address.

248
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,138
It's in the second district.

249
00:18:19,335 --> 00:18:20,863
Near the Prater. You know it?

250
00:18:21,064 --> 00:18:23,878
The big Ferris wheel?<br/>We should go. We should.

251
00:18:24,073 --> 00:18:26,494
Perhaps you can go to the Prater<br/>before the play.

252
00:18:26,696 --> 00:18:29,413
It starts at 2130.

253
00:18:29,832 --> 00:18:31,807
- 2130?<br/>- It's at 9:30.

254
00:18:32,009 --> 00:18:33,950
- 9:30.<br/>- Oh, right.

255
00:18:34,216 --> 00:18:35,808
What's the name of this play?

256
00:18:36,007 --> 00:18:39,935
It translates as "Bring Me the Horns<br/>of Wilmington's Cow. "

257
00:18:40,136 --> 00:18:41,183
I'm Wilmington's cow.

258
00:18:41,671 --> 00:18:43,079
- All right.<br/>- Great.

259
00:18:43,272 --> 00:18:44,320
- You'll be there?<br/>- We'll try.

260
00:18:44,519 --> 00:18:46,243
I'm the cow.

261
00:18:46,472 --> 00:18:47,398
Goodbye.

262
00:19:07,335 --> 00:19:09,506
I got an idea. Are you ready?

263
00:19:09,703 --> 00:19:12,257
It's Q and A time.<br/>We've known each other a little while.

264
00:19:12,455 --> 00:19:16,284
We're stuck together, so we'll ask<br/>each other a few direct questions.

265
00:19:16,551 --> 00:19:17,566
All right?

266
00:19:17,927 --> 00:19:21,669
- We ask each other questions?<br/>- And you have to answer honestly.

267
00:19:21,863 --> 00:19:23,554
- Of course.<br/>- Okay.

268
00:19:23,751 --> 00:19:25,475
All right, first question.

269
00:19:25,671 --> 00:19:27,776
- You.<br/>- Yes, I am going to ask you.

270
00:19:27,975 --> 00:19:31,553
Describe for me your<br/>first sexual feelings...

271
00:19:31,751 --> 00:19:33,758
...towards a person.

272
00:19:34,599 --> 00:19:36,868
My first sexual feelings?<br/>Oh, my God.

273
00:19:39,014 --> 00:19:40,672
I know. I know.

274
00:19:40,902 --> 00:19:42,529
Jean-Marc Fleury.

275
00:19:43,206 --> 00:19:44,799
Jean-Marc Fleury?

276
00:19:45,255 --> 00:19:48,866
We were at this summer camp together,<br/>and he was a swimmer.

277
00:19:49,478 --> 00:19:52,326
He had bleached-out<br/>chlorine hair and green eyes...

278
00:19:52,518 --> 00:19:55,650
...and to improve his times,<br/>he'd shave his legs and arms.

279
00:19:55,846 --> 00:19:59,141
- That's disgusting.<br/>- He was like this gorgeous dolphin.

280
00:19:59,334 --> 00:20:01,473
My friend Emma<br/>had a big crush on him.

281
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:04,965
So one day, I was cutting across<br/>the field back to my room...

282
00:20:05,158 --> 00:20:07,776
...and he came walking up beside me.<br/>I told him...

283
00:20:07,974 --> 00:20:11,236
..."You should date Emma.<br/>She has a big crush on you. "

284
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:12,925
And he turned to me and said...

285
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:16,835
..."Well, that's too bad, because<br/>I have a big crush on you. "

286
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:20,064
So, yeah, it really scared<br/>the hell out of me...

287
00:20:20,262 --> 00:20:22,367
...because I thought he was so fine.

288
00:20:22,598 --> 00:20:27,333
Then he officially asked me on a date.<br/>I pretended I didn't like him.

289
00:20:28,422 --> 00:20:32,645
You know, I was so afraid of<br/>what I might do, you know.

290
00:20:34,245 --> 00:20:37,540
So I went to see him swim<br/>a few times at the competition.

291
00:20:37,734 --> 00:20:40,636
And he was so sexy. Really.<br/>I mean, really sexy.

292
00:20:40,838 --> 00:20:45,148
We wrote these little declarations<br/>of love at the end of the summer...

293
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:48,611
...and, you know, promised we would<br/>keep writing forever...

294
00:20:48,805 --> 00:20:50,977
...and meet again very soon and...

295
00:20:51,173 --> 00:20:52,188
Did you?

296
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:53,826
Of course not.

297
00:20:54,245 --> 00:20:58,685
Then this is the opportune time<br/>to tell you I'm a fantastic swimmer.

298
00:20:59,174 --> 00:21:00,417
- Really?<br/>- Yeah.

299
00:21:01,254 --> 00:21:03,522
- I make note of that.<br/>- Okay.

300
00:21:03,717 --> 00:21:06,084
- So it's my turn. No?<br/>- Yes, your turn.

301
00:21:06,276 --> 00:21:07,455
Hit me.

302
00:21:09,285 --> 00:21:11,009
Have you ever been in love?

303
00:21:12,805 --> 00:21:13,665
Yes.

304
00:21:13,861 --> 00:21:14,940
Next question.

305
00:21:15,621 --> 00:21:17,114
- What was the...<br/>- Wait a minute.

306
00:21:17,317 --> 00:21:19,586
- So I can give one-word answers?<br/>- Why not?

307
00:21:19,781 --> 00:21:22,530
After I went into detail<br/>about my sexual feelings?

308
00:21:22,725 --> 00:21:27,002
They're different questions. I could<br/>answer the sexual-feelings thing.

309
00:21:27,205 --> 00:21:30,750
But, you know, love... I mean,<br/>what if I asked you about love?

310
00:21:30,949 --> 00:21:34,560
I would have lied, but at least<br/>I would have made up a great story.

311
00:21:34,756 --> 00:21:37,244
Love is a complex issue, you know?

312
00:21:37,444 --> 00:21:41,983
I mean, yes, I've told somebody<br/>that I love them, and I've meant it.

313
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:45,279
But was it totally unselfish,<br/>giving love?

314
00:21:45,475 --> 00:21:47,298
Was it a beautiful thing?

315
00:21:47,492 --> 00:21:50,427
Not really.<br/>You know, it's like, love...

316
00:21:51,012 --> 00:21:52,736
I mean, I don't know.

317
00:21:53,348 --> 00:21:54,242
You know?

318
00:21:55,364 --> 00:21:58,812
- Yeah. I know what you mean.<br/>- But as far as sexual feelings go...

319
00:21:59,012 --> 00:22:01,762
...it started with<br/>an obsessive relationship...

320
00:22:01,955 --> 00:22:04,857
<i>...with Miss July, 1978.<br/>Do you know Playboy magazine?</i>

321
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:07,296
- I've heard of it.<br/>- You know Crystal?

322
00:22:07,683 --> 00:22:10,106
You don't know Crystal?<br/>Well, I knew Crystal.

323
00:22:12,227 --> 00:22:13,788
Is it my turn now?

324
00:22:14,148 --> 00:22:16,569
Tell me something that<br/>really pisses you off.

325
00:22:16,771 --> 00:22:19,226
- Really drives you crazy.<br/>- Pisses me off.

326
00:22:19,428 --> 00:22:22,079
- God, everything pisses me off.<br/>- List a couple.

327
00:22:23,268 --> 00:22:26,465
Oh, I know. I hate being told<br/>by strange men...

328
00:22:26,659 --> 00:22:28,448
...strange men in the street...

329
00:22:28,644 --> 00:22:33,247
...you know, to smile to make them<br/>feel better about their boring life.

330
00:22:33,795 --> 00:22:34,810
What else?

331
00:22:35,011 --> 00:22:36,288
I hate...

332
00:22:36,484 --> 00:22:39,832
I hate that 300 kilometers from here,<br/>there's a war...

333
00:22:40,036 --> 00:22:42,141
...people are dying,<br/>and nobody knows what to do.

334
00:22:42,339 --> 00:22:44,543
Or they don't give a shit.<br/>I don't know.

335
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:48,220
I hate that the media's<br/>trying to control our minds.

336
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:49,980
- The media?<br/>- Yeah, the media.

337
00:22:50,179 --> 00:22:53,561
It's very subtle, but it's<br/>a new form of fascism, really.

338
00:22:55,396 --> 00:22:56,475
I hate...

339
00:22:57,347 --> 00:23:00,730
I hate when I'm in a foreign country,<br/>especially in America...

340
00:23:00,930 --> 00:23:05,306
...each time I wear black or lose my<br/>temper or say anything about anything...

341
00:23:05,507 --> 00:23:08,639
...they always go,<br/>"Oh, it's so French. It's so cute. "

342
00:23:08,835 --> 00:23:12,064
I hate that.<br/>I can't stand that. Really.

343
00:23:13,123 --> 00:23:14,104
Is that all?

344
00:23:14,371 --> 00:23:16,759
Well, there's a lot of things, but...

345
00:23:16,962 --> 00:23:19,330
- So it's my turn.<br/>- Okay.

346
00:23:19,618 --> 00:23:21,757
- You're gonna answer.<br/>- Yes, I'll answer.

347
00:23:21,954 --> 00:23:23,612
What's a problem for you?

348
00:23:24,258 --> 00:23:25,568
You, probably.

349
00:23:25,826 --> 00:23:26,775
What?

350
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:30,367
I had a thought the other day<br/>that kind of...

351
00:23:30,562 --> 00:23:32,286
...qualifies as a problem.

352
00:23:32,579 --> 00:23:33,560
What is it?

353
00:23:33,762 --> 00:23:36,609
It was a thought I had<br/>on the train, so...

354
00:23:36,802 --> 00:23:38,395
Okay. All right.

355
00:23:38,626 --> 00:23:40,382
Do you believe in reincarnation?

356
00:23:40,610 --> 00:23:42,519
Yeah. Yeah, it's interesting.

357
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:46,780
A lot of people talk about past<br/>lives and things like that, you know?

358
00:23:46,979 --> 00:23:50,295
And even if they don't believe in it<br/>in some specific way...

359
00:23:50,498 --> 00:23:52,702
...people have a notion<br/>of an eternal soul.

360
00:23:52,898 --> 00:23:53,759
- Yeah.<br/>- Okay.

361
00:23:53,954 --> 00:23:56,343
This is my thought:<br/>50,000 years ago...

362
00:23:56,545 --> 00:23:58,433
...there's not even a million people.

363
00:23:58,625 --> 00:24:02,302
Ten thousand years ago,<br/>there's, like, two million people.

364
00:24:02,498 --> 00:24:06,295
Now there's between five and six<br/>billion people on the planet.

365
00:24:06,497 --> 00:24:07,959
If we all have our own...

366
00:24:08,161 --> 00:24:09,983
...individual, unique...

367
00:24:10,241 --> 00:24:11,102
...soul...

368
00:24:11,521 --> 00:24:13,245
...where did they all come from?

369
00:24:13,441 --> 00:24:16,889
Are modern souls only<br/>a fraction of the original souls?

370
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:20,919
If they are, that represents<br/>a 5000 to 1 split of each soul...

371
00:24:21,122 --> 00:24:24,699
...in the last 50,000 years, which is<br/>a blip in the Earth's time.

372
00:24:24,897 --> 00:24:28,028
So at best, we're these<br/>tiny fractions...

373
00:24:28,385 --> 00:24:29,629
...of people walking...

374
00:24:29,826 --> 00:24:33,982
Is that why we're so scattered?<br/>Is that why we're so specialized?

375
00:24:34,177 --> 00:24:35,671
Wait a minute, I'm not sure...

376
00:24:35,873 --> 00:24:39,189
Yeah, I know, I know.<br/>It's a totally scattered thought.

377
00:24:40,161 --> 00:24:42,201
Which is kind of why it makes sense.

378
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,476
I agree with you.

379
00:24:45,664 --> 00:24:47,487
Let's get off this damn train.

380
00:25:21,728 --> 00:25:23,353
This place is pretty neat.

381
00:25:23,551 --> 00:25:24,500
Yeah.

382
00:25:24,705 --> 00:25:26,941
There's even a listening booth.

383
00:25:30,623 --> 00:25:32,762
Have you heard of this singer?

384
00:25:34,496 --> 00:25:36,668
I think she's American.<br/>A friend told me about her.

385
00:25:36,864 --> 00:25:40,060
Do you want to go see if that<br/>listening booth still works?

386
00:25:40,256 --> 00:25:41,401
Yeah, okay.

387
00:26:17,599 --> 00:26:21,975
<i>There's a wind that<br/>Blows in from the north</i>

388
00:26:22,175 --> 00:26:26,812
<i>And it says that loving<br/>Takes this course</i>

389
00:26:27,295 --> 00:26:29,684
<i>Come here</i>

390
00:26:31,904 --> 00:26:34,292
<i>Come here</i>

391
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:40,250
<i>No, I'm not impossible to touch</i>

392
00:26:40,511 --> 00:26:45,114
<i>I have never wanted you so much</i>

393
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:48,118
<i>Come here</i>

394
00:26:50,239 --> 00:26:51,995
<i>Come here</i>

395
00:26:53,374 --> 00:26:58,110
<i>Have I never laid down by your side</i>

396
00:26:59,134 --> 00:27:03,739
<i>Baby, let's forget about this pride</i>

397
00:27:04,222 --> 00:27:06,775
<i>Come here</i>

398
00:27:08,702 --> 00:27:11,735
<i>Come here</i>

399
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:19,131
Look at this. This is beautiful.

400
00:27:26,046 --> 00:27:27,508
Quick. It's leaving.

401
00:27:51,133 --> 00:27:52,595
Look, there's a rabbit.

402
00:27:53,245 --> 00:27:54,139
Yeah.

403
00:27:55,228 --> 00:27:56,658
Hey there, rabbit.

404
00:27:57,821 --> 00:27:59,130
It's so cute.

405
00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:03,931
I visited this as a young teenager.

406
00:28:04,797 --> 00:28:08,408
It left a bigger impression on me<br/>at that time than the museums.

407
00:28:08,605 --> 00:28:10,329
Yeah? It's tiny.

408
00:28:10,525 --> 00:28:11,573
I know.

409
00:28:12,061 --> 00:28:15,127
A little old man talked to us.<br/>He was the groundskeeper.

410
00:28:15,326 --> 00:28:18,042
He explained that most<br/>of the people buried here...

411
00:28:18,237 --> 00:28:20,659
...had washed up on the bank<br/>of the Danube.

412
00:28:22,108 --> 00:28:23,515
How old are these?

413
00:28:23,997 --> 00:28:27,609
Around the beginning of the century.<br/>It's called No Name Cemetery...

414
00:28:27,805 --> 00:28:30,292
...because they often didn't know<br/>who those people were.

415
00:28:30,492 --> 00:28:32,499
Maybe a first name, that's all.

416
00:28:32,828 --> 00:28:34,651
Why were all the bodies washing up?

417
00:28:34,844 --> 00:28:38,619
I think some were from accidents<br/>on boats and things like that.

418
00:28:38,813 --> 00:28:41,976
But most of them were suicides<br/>that jumped in the river.

419
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:47,479
I always liked the idea of all those<br/>unknown people lost in the world.

420
00:28:47,676 --> 00:28:49,650
When I was a little girl,<br/>I thought...

421
00:28:49,852 --> 00:28:52,273
...if none of your family or friends<br/>knew you were dead...

422
00:28:52,476 --> 00:28:54,363
...then it's like<br/>not really being dead.

423
00:28:54,555 --> 00:28:57,338
People can invent the best<br/>and the worst for you.

424
00:29:00,701 --> 00:29:02,675
Here she is, I think.

425
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:06,168
Yeah, this is the one<br/>I remember the most.

426
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:11,507
She was only 13 when she died.

427
00:29:11,899 --> 00:29:16,122
That meant something to me.<br/>I was that age when I first saw this.

428
00:29:20,411 --> 00:29:25,016
Now I'm 10 years older,<br/>and she's still 13, I guess.

429
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:27,219
That's funny.

430
00:29:46,683 --> 00:29:48,657
That's the Danube over there.

431
00:29:49,147 --> 00:29:50,740
That's a river, right?

432
00:29:50,972 --> 00:29:51,920
Yeah.

433
00:29:59,579 --> 00:30:01,073
This is...

434
00:30:01,338 --> 00:30:02,647
...gorgeous.

435
00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:05,650
Yeah, this is beautiful.

436
00:30:11,674 --> 00:30:12,820
I mean, we got...

437
00:30:13,179 --> 00:30:14,640
We got a sunset here.

438
00:30:15,546 --> 00:30:17,816
- Yeah.<br/>- We got the Ferris wheel.

439
00:30:19,867 --> 00:30:21,557
It seems like...

440
00:30:22,331 --> 00:30:23,759
...this would be a...

441
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:26,584
What?

442
00:30:30,778 --> 00:30:31,826
You know...

443
00:30:36,826 --> 00:30:39,128
Are you trying to say<br/>you want to kiss me?

444
00:31:45,593 --> 00:31:46,541
But you know what?

445
00:31:46,745 --> 00:31:49,559
It doesn't matter what<br/>generation you're born into.

446
00:31:49,754 --> 00:31:50,964
Look at my parents.

447
00:31:51,161 --> 00:31:55,187
They were angry, young May '68 people<br/>revolting against everything.

448
00:31:55,385 --> 00:31:58,996
The government, their conservative<br/>Catholic backgrounds...

449
00:31:59,193 --> 00:32:02,541
Then I was born, and my father<br/>became a successful architect.

450
00:32:02,744 --> 00:32:05,646
We traveled around the world<br/>while he built bridges...

451
00:32:05,848 --> 00:32:07,987
...and, you know, towers and stuff.

452
00:32:08,249 --> 00:32:10,932
I mean, I really can't<br/>complain about anything.

453
00:32:11,129 --> 00:32:13,038
They love me more than anything...

454
00:32:13,241 --> 00:32:16,274
...and I've been raised with all<br/>the freedom they fought for.

455
00:32:16,473 --> 00:32:19,375
And yet, for me now,<br/>it's another type of fight.

456
00:32:19,576 --> 00:32:22,772
We have to deal with the same shit,<br/>but we can't really know...

457
00:32:22,968 --> 00:32:25,357
...who or, you know, what the enemy is.

458
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:28,277
I don't know if<br/>there really is an enemy.

459
00:32:28,472 --> 00:32:30,447
Everybody's parents fucked them up.

460
00:32:30,647 --> 00:32:33,964
Rich kids' parents gave them too much.<br/>Poor kids', not enough.

461
00:32:34,169 --> 00:32:36,437
Too much attention,<br/>not enough attention.

462
00:32:36,632 --> 00:32:39,730
They either left or<br/>taught them the wrong things.

463
00:32:39,928 --> 00:32:43,573
My parents are just two people<br/>who didn't like each other much...

464
00:32:43,768 --> 00:32:45,557
...who got married and had a kid.

465
00:32:45,752 --> 00:32:47,988
And they tried their best<br/>to be nice to me.

466
00:32:49,272 --> 00:32:51,989
- Did your parents divorce?<br/>- Yeah, finally.

467
00:32:52,183 --> 00:32:54,322
They should have done it sooner.<br/>They stuck together...

468
00:32:54,519 --> 00:32:58,033
...for the well-being of my sister<br/>and I. Thank you very much.

469
00:32:58,327 --> 00:33:01,622
I remember my mother told me<br/>right in front of my father...

470
00:33:01,815 --> 00:33:04,237
...that he didn't really<br/>want to have me.

471
00:33:04,439 --> 00:33:07,603
That he was pissed off when<br/>he found out she was pregnant.

472
00:33:07,799 --> 00:33:11,280
That I was a big mistake.<br/>That really shaped the way I think.

473
00:33:11,479 --> 00:33:15,570
I always saw the world as this place<br/>where I really wasn't meant to be.

474
00:33:15,767 --> 00:33:16,716
That's so sad.

475
00:33:16,919 --> 00:33:19,952
Well, I mean, I eventually<br/>kind of took pride in it.

476
00:33:20,150 --> 00:33:22,539
You know, like my life<br/>was my own doing.

477
00:33:22,743 --> 00:33:25,743
You know, like I was<br/>crashing the big party.

478
00:33:25,943 --> 00:33:27,885
That's the way to see it.

479
00:33:28,086 --> 00:33:31,315
My parents are still married<br/>and I guess they're happy.

480
00:33:31,863 --> 00:33:36,238
But I think it's healthy to rebel<br/>against everything that came before.

481
00:33:40,503 --> 00:33:42,675
You know, I've been wondering lately...

482
00:33:43,415 --> 00:33:46,710
...do you know anyone<br/>who's in a happy relationship?

483
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:51,180
Yeah, sure. You know,<br/>I know happy couples.

484
00:33:51,927 --> 00:33:53,901
But I think they lie to each other.

485
00:33:54,583 --> 00:33:55,793
Yeah.

486
00:33:56,727 --> 00:33:58,734
People can live their<br/>whole life as a lie.

487
00:33:58,934 --> 00:34:00,757
My grandmother was married...

488
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:03,917
...and I thought she had an<br/>uncomplicated love life.

489
00:34:04,118 --> 00:34:07,980
But she just confessed to me<br/>that she spent her whole life...

490
00:34:08,183 --> 00:34:11,117
...dreaming about another man<br/>she was in love with.

491
00:34:11,414 --> 00:34:14,512
She just accepted her fate.<br/>It's so sad.

492
00:34:15,062 --> 00:34:17,713
In the same time, I love that<br/>she had these emotions...

493
00:34:17,909 --> 00:34:20,146
...and feelings I never<br/>thought she had.

494
00:34:20,341 --> 00:34:22,480
I guarantee you<br/>it was better that way.

495
00:34:22,678 --> 00:34:25,907
If she'd known him, he'd have<br/>disappointed her eventually.

496
00:34:26,101 --> 00:34:28,371
- How do you know?<br/>- I know. I know.

497
00:34:28,565 --> 00:34:31,020
People put romantic projections<br/>on everything.

498
00:34:31,222 --> 00:34:33,808
It's not based in any kind of reality.

499
00:34:34,006 --> 00:34:37,551
Romantic projections?<br/>Oh, Mr. Romantic up in the Ferris wheel?

500
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:40,913
"Oh, kiss me. The sunset.<br/>Oh, it's so beautiful. "

501
00:34:41,109 --> 00:34:44,459
Tell me about your grandmother.<br/>What were you saying about her?

502
00:35:02,133 --> 00:35:03,311
Check these guys out.

503
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:07,819
"Hans, I have a confession. I'm not<br/>wearing underwear underneath this. "

504
00:35:08,021 --> 00:35:10,573
"Oh, really? Does that frighten you?"

505
00:35:16,724 --> 00:35:18,099
Can I tell you a secret?

506
00:35:18,452 --> 00:35:19,435
Yeah.

507
00:35:19,637 --> 00:35:20,717
Come here.

508
00:35:21,045 --> 00:35:22,452
- What?<br/>- Come here.

509
00:35:35,924 --> 00:35:38,794
Look at this palm reader.<br/>She's interesting looking.

510
00:35:38,996 --> 00:35:39,978
Yeah.

511
00:35:40,405 --> 00:35:41,812
- Uh-oh. Uh-oh.<br/>- What?

512
00:35:42,261 --> 00:35:44,650
- I made eye contact.<br/>- She's not coming over here.

513
00:35:44,852 --> 00:35:46,763
- Yes, she is.<br/>- Oh, shit.

514
00:35:49,812 --> 00:35:50,924
Oh, no.

515
00:35:51,188 --> 00:35:53,097
- You want your palm read?<br/>- No.

516
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:55,373
- Are you sure?<br/>- I'm sure.

517
00:35:55,571 --> 00:35:57,001
- Okay.<br/>- Hello.

518
00:35:57,556 --> 00:35:58,832
Oh, here she is.

519
00:36:08,659 --> 00:36:10,514
I want your palm read.

520
00:36:12,947 --> 00:36:14,638
Yeah. How much is it?

521
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:16,488
For you, 50.

522
00:36:16,787 --> 00:36:17,802
Okay?

523
00:36:18,163 --> 00:36:19,091
Okay.

524
00:36:25,427 --> 00:36:28,274
So you have been on a journey...

525
00:36:28,467 --> 00:36:30,355
...and you're a stranger<br/>to this place.

526
00:36:31,988 --> 00:36:32,915
You are...

527
00:36:33,107 --> 00:36:34,601
...an adventurer.

528
00:36:35,027 --> 00:36:36,554
A seeker.

529
00:36:37,554 --> 00:36:39,464
An adventurer in your mind.

530
00:36:44,211 --> 00:36:47,376
You are interested<br/>in the power of the woman.

531
00:36:47,571 --> 00:36:52,273
In the woman's deep strength<br/>and creativity.

532
00:36:52,659 --> 00:36:54,895
You're becoming this woman.

533
00:36:59,923 --> 00:37:04,146
You need to resign yourself<br/>to the awkwardness of life.

534
00:37:04,786 --> 00:37:08,048
Only if you find peace<br/>within yourself...

535
00:37:08,691 --> 00:37:12,106
...will you find<br/>true connection with others.

536
00:37:15,474 --> 00:37:16,881
That is a stranger to you?

537
00:37:17,682 --> 00:37:18,959
I guess so.

538
00:37:24,499 --> 00:37:27,051
You will be all right.<br/>He's learning.

539
00:37:27,825 --> 00:37:28,774
Okay.

540
00:37:29,362 --> 00:37:30,256
Money.

541
00:37:37,746 --> 00:37:39,601
You're both stars.

542
00:37:39,794 --> 00:37:41,289
Don't forget.

543
00:37:41,746 --> 00:37:44,681
When the stars exploded<br/>billions of years ago...

544
00:37:44,882 --> 00:37:47,566
...they formed everything<br/>that is this world.

545
00:37:47,762 --> 00:37:50,511
Everything we know is stardust.

546
00:37:50,706 --> 00:37:54,481
So don't forget, you are stardust.

547
00:37:59,122 --> 00:38:00,682
That's very nice and all.

548
00:38:00,881 --> 00:38:03,118
I mean, that we're all stardust...

549
00:38:03,313 --> 00:38:05,648
...and you're becoming this great woman.

550
00:38:06,225 --> 00:38:08,614
But I hope you don't take that<br/>any more seriously...

551
00:38:08,817 --> 00:38:10,857
...than some horoscope<br/>in a newspaper.

552
00:38:11,058 --> 00:38:15,149
What? She knew I was on vacation<br/>and that we didn't know each other...

553
00:38:15,345 --> 00:38:18,127
...and that I was going<br/>to become this great woman.

554
00:38:18,321 --> 00:38:20,590
But what was that<br/>"I am learning" bullshit?

555
00:38:20,785 --> 00:38:23,022
That's way condescending, you know?

556
00:38:23,217 --> 00:38:25,191
I mean, she wasn't even doing me.

557
00:38:25,425 --> 00:38:29,549
I mean, if opportunists like that<br/>ever had to tell the real truth...

558
00:38:29,745 --> 00:38:31,719
...it would put them<br/>out of business.

559
00:38:31,921 --> 00:38:36,329
Just once, I'd love to see some<br/>little old lady save up all her money...

560
00:38:36,529 --> 00:38:41,002
...to go to the fortuneteller. She'd<br/>get there and the woman would say...

561
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,928
..."Tomorrow and all<br/>your remaining days...

562
00:38:46,129 --> 00:38:48,071
...will be exactly like today...

563
00:38:48,272 --> 00:38:50,694
...a tedious collection of hours.

564
00:38:50,896 --> 00:38:53,995
And you will have no new passions<br/>and no new thoughts...

565
00:38:54,193 --> 00:38:56,494
...and no new travels.

566
00:38:56,689 --> 00:38:59,471
And when you die,<br/>you'll be completely forgotten.

567
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,807
Fifty schillings, please. "

568
00:39:02,001 --> 00:39:03,659
That I'd like to see.

569
00:39:04,688 --> 00:39:06,062
It's so funny how...

570
00:39:06,256 --> 00:39:09,638
...she almost didn't notice you.<br/>It's weird. I wonder why.

571
00:39:09,873 --> 00:39:13,833
She was really wise and intense.<br/>I really loved what she said.

572
00:39:14,032 --> 00:39:17,709
You pay your money to hear what<br/>makes you feel good about yourself.

573
00:39:17,904 --> 00:39:21,253
Maybe there's a seedy section of Vienna.<br/>We can buy a hit of crack.

574
00:39:21,456 --> 00:39:22,917
Would you like that?

575
00:39:23,696 --> 00:39:25,158
You're so...

576
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,327
Stardust. Stardust.

577
00:39:37,392 --> 00:39:39,082
There's an exhibition.

578
00:39:40,752 --> 00:39:43,948
I guess we'll miss it.<br/>It doesn't start until next week.

579
00:39:44,432 --> 00:39:46,254
Yeah, I think so.

580
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:51,084
I actually saw this one in a museum.

581
00:39:52,335 --> 00:39:54,190
I stared and stared at it.

582
00:39:54,384 --> 00:39:56,588
Must have been 45 minutes.

583
00:39:57,328 --> 00:39:58,342
I love it.

584
00:39:59,183 --> 00:40:01,518
<i>La voie ferrйe.<br/>It's great.</i>

585
00:40:03,215 --> 00:40:06,663
I love the way the people are<br/>dissolving into the background.

586
00:40:08,015 --> 00:40:08,909
Look at this.

587
00:40:10,608 --> 00:40:12,036
It's like the environments...

588
00:40:12,463 --> 00:40:14,536
...are stronger than the people.

589
00:40:16,143 --> 00:40:18,957
His human figures are<br/>always so transitory.

590
00:40:19,152 --> 00:40:21,126
It's funny. Transitory?

591
00:40:21,615 --> 00:40:23,022
Transitory.

592
00:40:41,294 --> 00:40:44,196
- You think this is open?<br/>- I don't know. Let's try it.

593
00:41:09,454 --> 00:41:11,210
I was in an old church like this...

594
00:41:11,406 --> 00:41:14,406
...with my grandmother<br/>a few days ago in Budapest.

595
00:41:16,430 --> 00:41:19,147
Even though I reject<br/>most of the religious thing...

596
00:41:19,471 --> 00:41:23,267
...I can't help but feeling for<br/>those people that come here...

597
00:41:23,470 --> 00:41:26,601
...lost or in pain, guilt...

598
00:41:27,311 --> 00:41:29,546
...looking for some kind of answers.

599
00:41:30,990 --> 00:41:34,503
It fascinates me how a single place<br/>can join pain and happiness...

600
00:41:34,702 --> 00:41:36,938
...of so many generations.

601
00:41:37,518 --> 00:41:39,525
You're close with your grandmother?

602
00:41:41,230 --> 00:41:42,244
Yeah.

603
00:41:44,557 --> 00:41:48,103
I think it's because I always<br/>have this strange feeling...

604
00:41:48,302 --> 00:41:52,130
...that I'm this very old woman<br/>laying down, about to die.

605
00:41:53,678 --> 00:41:55,782
You know, that my life is just...

606
00:41:56,077 --> 00:41:57,735
...her memories or something.

607
00:42:01,261 --> 00:42:02,887
That's so wild.

608
00:42:04,845 --> 00:42:08,293
I always think that I'm still<br/>this 13-year-old boy...

609
00:42:08,493 --> 00:42:11,459
...who doesn't really know how<br/>to be an adult, pretending to...

610
00:42:11,661 --> 00:42:15,970
...live my life, taking notes for when<br/>I'll really have to do it.

611
00:42:16,333 --> 00:42:19,115
Like I'm in a dress rehearsal<br/>for a junior high play.

612
00:42:21,453 --> 00:42:22,882
That's funny.

613
00:42:23,661 --> 00:42:25,864
Then up there in the Ferris wheel,<br/>it was like...

614
00:42:26,061 --> 00:42:29,956
...this very old woman<br/>kissing this very young boy. Right?

615
00:42:34,572 --> 00:42:38,467
Do you know anything about<br/>the Quakers, the Quaker religion?

616
00:42:38,893 --> 00:42:39,907
No, not much.

617
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:43,300
Well, I went to<br/>this Quaker wedding once...

618
00:42:43,501 --> 00:42:45,289
...and it was fantastic.

619
00:42:45,613 --> 00:42:46,725
What they do is...

620
00:42:46,924 --> 00:42:51,015
...the couple comes in and they kneel<br/>in front of the whole congregation...

621
00:42:51,212 --> 00:42:52,673
...and they stare at each other.

622
00:42:53,805 --> 00:42:57,601
Nobody says a word unless they feel<br/>that God moves them to speak...

623
00:42:57,804 --> 00:42:59,397
...or say something.

624
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:02,853
And then, after an hour or so of just...

625
00:43:04,268 --> 00:43:06,024
...staring at each other...

626
00:43:06,476 --> 00:43:07,785
...they're married.

627
00:43:09,643 --> 00:43:11,618
That's beautiful. I like that.

628
00:43:27,723 --> 00:43:29,152
This is a horrible story.

629
00:43:30,187 --> 00:43:31,136
What?

630
00:43:31,692 --> 00:43:33,960
It's not the appropriate place<br/>to tell it.

631
00:43:34,155 --> 00:43:36,970
Well, I was driving around<br/>with this buddy of mine.

632
00:43:37,164 --> 00:43:38,986
He's a big atheist, you know.

633
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:41,929
And he came to a stop<br/>next to this homeless guy.

634
00:43:42,187 --> 00:43:44,326
My buddy takes out a $ 100 bill...

635
00:43:44,524 --> 00:43:45,864
...and leans out the window...

636
00:43:46,059 --> 00:43:49,189
...and he says,<br/>"Do you believe in God?"

637
00:43:49,995 --> 00:43:53,574
And the guy looks at my friend,<br/>he looks at the money.

638
00:43:53,835 --> 00:43:55,658
He says...

639
00:43:56,011 --> 00:43:57,603
..."Yes, I do. "

640
00:43:57,802 --> 00:43:59,658
My friend says, "Wrong answer. "

641
00:43:59,850 --> 00:44:01,279
We drove away.

642
00:44:02,091 --> 00:44:03,520
That's mean.

643
00:44:14,347 --> 00:44:18,023
Would you be in Paris by now<br/>if you hadn't gotten off the train?

644
00:44:18,474 --> 00:44:20,067
No, not yet.

645
00:44:21,163 --> 00:44:22,340
What would you be doing?

646
00:44:22,537 --> 00:44:25,091
I'd probably be hanging around<br/>the airport...

647
00:44:25,291 --> 00:44:28,519
...crying in my coffee<br/>because you didn't come with me.

648
00:44:32,458 --> 00:44:36,070
I'd probably gotten off the train<br/>in Salzburg with someone else.

649
00:44:36,266 --> 00:44:38,154
Oh, yeah? Oh, I see.

650
00:44:38,346 --> 00:44:40,169
So I'm just a dumb American...

651
00:44:40,362 --> 00:44:44,323
...momentarily decorating<br/>your blank canvas, huh?

652
00:44:44,554 --> 00:44:47,554
- I'm having a great time.<br/>- Really?

653
00:44:47,753 --> 00:44:48,931
Me too.

654
00:44:50,666 --> 00:44:52,554
I'm glad, because<br/>no one knows I'm here.

655
00:44:52,746 --> 00:44:54,656
I don't know anyone<br/>that would tell me...

656
00:44:54,858 --> 00:44:56,865
...all those bad things you've done.

657
00:44:57,066 --> 00:44:59,302
- I'll tell you some.<br/>- Yeah, I'm sure.

658
00:45:00,266 --> 00:45:04,096
You hear so much shit about people.<br/>I always feel like...

659
00:45:04,297 --> 00:45:06,600
...the general of an army<br/>when I start dating.

660
00:45:06,794 --> 00:45:08,801
Plotting my strategy<br/>and maneuverings...

661
00:45:09,002 --> 00:45:12,385
...knowing his weak points,<br/>what would hurt him, seduce him.

662
00:45:12,682 --> 00:45:14,055
It's horrible.

663
00:45:18,185 --> 00:45:19,876
If we were always around each other...

664
00:45:20,074 --> 00:45:23,718
...what would be the first thing<br/>about me that would drive you mad?

665
00:45:24,425 --> 00:45:27,272
No. I'm not going to<br/>answer this question.

666
00:45:27,465 --> 00:45:30,432
I dated this girl once<br/>who used to always ask me that.

667
00:45:30,633 --> 00:45:32,161
"What about me bugs you?"

668
00:45:32,361 --> 00:45:35,907
Finally I said, "I don't think<br/>you handle criticism too well. "

669
00:45:36,105 --> 00:45:39,072
She flew into a rage and<br/>broke up with me. That's true.

670
00:45:39,273 --> 00:45:41,313
All she wanted was<br/>to have an excuse...

671
00:45:41,513 --> 00:45:44,098
...to tell me what she thought<br/>was wrong with me.

672
00:45:44,296 --> 00:45:45,474
Is that what you want?

673
00:45:45,673 --> 00:45:47,331
Something about me bugs you?

674
00:45:47,818 --> 00:45:50,599
- What is it about me bugs you?<br/>- Nothing at all.

675
00:45:50,793 --> 00:45:53,160
If it had to be something,<br/>what would it be?

676
00:45:53,513 --> 00:45:56,862
If it had to be something,<br/>if I had to think about it...

677
00:45:57,065 --> 00:46:00,513
...I kind of didn't really like this<br/>reaction at the palm reader.

678
00:46:00,712 --> 00:46:02,981
You were like this rooster prick.

679
00:46:03,176 --> 00:46:04,965
What the hell<br/>is a rooster prick?

680
00:46:05,161 --> 00:46:06,589
You were like a boy whining...

681
00:46:06,793 --> 00:46:09,345
...because all the attention<br/>wasn't focused on him.

682
00:46:09,545 --> 00:46:12,512
All right, listen.<br/>This woman robs you blind, okay?

683
00:46:12,712 --> 00:46:14,949
You were like a boy<br/>walking by an ice-cream store...

684
00:46:15,144 --> 00:46:17,795
...crying because his mom<br/>won't buy him a milk shake.

685
00:46:17,991 --> 00:46:20,926
I don't care what this charlatan<br/>has to say about...

686
00:46:23,048 --> 00:46:24,128
What?

687
00:46:26,921 --> 00:46:29,254
I understand a little,<br/>but he doesn't at all.

688
00:46:33,096 --> 00:46:34,589
May I ask you a question?

689
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:39,622
So I would like to<br/>make a deal with you.

690
00:46:41,447 --> 00:46:45,474
I mean, instead of just asking you<br/>for money, I will ask you for a word.

691
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:50,084
You give me a word, I take the word,<br/>and then I will write a poem...

692
00:46:50,312 --> 00:46:51,719
...with the word inside.

693
00:46:52,903 --> 00:46:55,270
And if you like it,<br/>if you like my poem...

694
00:46:55,655 --> 00:46:58,111
...if it adds something to<br/>your life in any way...

695
00:46:58,311 --> 00:47:00,831
...then you can pay me<br/>whatever you feel like.

696
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:03,389
I'll write in English, of course.

697
00:47:04,583 --> 00:47:06,208
- Okay.<br/>- All right. Great.

698
00:47:08,679 --> 00:47:09,726
So?

699
00:47:11,783 --> 00:47:12,994
Pick a word.

700
00:47:14,791 --> 00:47:15,838
A word.

701
00:47:17,318 --> 00:47:19,490
- Milk shake.<br/>- Milk shake? Oh, good.

702
00:47:19,687 --> 00:47:22,469
I was gonna say "rooster prick. "<br/>But great. Milk shake.

703
00:47:22,663 --> 00:47:24,037
"Milk shake"?

704
00:47:24,551 --> 00:47:26,274
Okay, milk shake.

705
00:47:26,918 --> 00:47:28,829
- All right, so...<br/>- Good.

706
00:47:39,431 --> 00:47:43,490
I gotta say, I like this<br/>Viennese variation of bum.

707
00:47:43,687 --> 00:47:46,653
I like what he said about<br/>adding something to your life.

708
00:47:46,855 --> 00:47:50,499
So, were we having<br/>our first fight back there?

709
00:47:51,879 --> 00:47:53,886
I think so. I think we were.

710
00:47:54,118 --> 00:47:57,534
Even if we were, why does everyone<br/>think conflict is so bad?

711
00:47:57,734 --> 00:48:00,451
There's a lot of good things<br/>coming out of conflict.

712
00:48:00,646 --> 00:48:02,304
Yeah, I guess so.

713
00:48:02,694 --> 00:48:05,793
I always think if I could<br/>just accept the fact...

714
00:48:05,990 --> 00:48:09,765
...that my life was supposed to be<br/>difficult, that's what's expected...

715
00:48:09,958 --> 00:48:11,714
...then I might not get so pissed off.

716
00:48:11,910 --> 00:48:14,594
And I'd just be glad<br/>when something nice happens.

717
00:48:14,822 --> 00:48:16,229
That's why I'm still in school.

718
00:48:16,421 --> 00:48:18,810
It's easier to have<br/>something to fight against.

719
00:48:19,014 --> 00:48:22,592
Well, we've all had such<br/>competitiveness ingrained in us.

720
00:48:23,014 --> 00:48:26,014
You know, I can be doing<br/>the most nothing thing.

721
00:48:26,214 --> 00:48:28,451
Throwing some darts<br/>or shooting some pool.

722
00:48:28,645 --> 00:48:31,362
Then all of a sudden,<br/>I feel it come over me.

723
00:48:31,557 --> 00:48:33,696
I have got to win.

724
00:48:33,894 --> 00:48:37,211
Is that why you tried to get me<br/>off the train? Competitiveness?

725
00:48:37,413 --> 00:48:38,690
What do you mean?

726
00:48:40,518 --> 00:48:41,663
I got a poem.

727
00:48:42,022 --> 00:48:43,515
Oh, all right.

728
00:48:45,157 --> 00:48:46,751
Will you read it to us?

729
00:48:50,245 --> 00:48:51,587
Sure. Okay.

730
00:48:55,461 --> 00:48:57,316
"Daydream delusion

731
00:48:57,765 --> 00:48:59,652
Limousine eyelash

732
00:49:00,549 --> 00:49:02,753
Oh, baby, with your pretty face

733
00:49:04,006 --> 00:49:07,781
Drop a tear in my wine glass<br/>Look at those big eyes

734
00:49:08,037 --> 00:49:10,077
See what you mean to me

735
00:49:10,405 --> 00:49:13,154
Sweetcakes and milk shakes

736
00:49:13,445 --> 00:49:15,518
I am a delusion angel

737
00:49:16,133 --> 00:49:18,140
I'm a fantasy parade

738
00:49:18,628 --> 00:49:22,403
I want you to know what I think<br/>Don't want you to guess anymore

739
00:49:22,597 --> 00:49:24,899
You have no idea where I came from

740
00:49:25,252 --> 00:49:27,075
We have no idea where we're going

741
00:49:27,397 --> 00:49:29,055
Lodged in life

742
00:49:29,252 --> 00:49:30,747
Like branches in the river

743
00:49:30,948 --> 00:49:33,763
Flowing downstream<br/>Caught in the current

744
00:49:33,988 --> 00:49:35,449
I carry you

745
00:49:35,717 --> 00:49:37,145
You'll carry me

746
00:49:37,861 --> 00:49:39,487
That's how it could be

747
00:49:40,644 --> 00:49:42,237
Don't you know me?

748
00:49:43,172 --> 00:49:44,927
Don't you know me by now?"

749
00:49:46,116 --> 00:49:47,261
Great.

750
00:49:47,908 --> 00:49:50,047
- Thanks.<br/>- Thanks, man.

751
00:49:53,509 --> 00:49:54,686
Here you go.

752
00:49:56,420 --> 00:49:58,046
- Thanks.<br/>- All right.

753
00:49:58,244 --> 00:50:00,349
- Here. Thank you.<br/>- Thank you.

754
00:50:00,549 --> 00:50:01,409
Good luck.

755
00:50:17,028 --> 00:50:18,653
It was wonderful, no?

756
00:50:23,139 --> 00:50:25,692
- What?<br/>- He probably didn't just write that.

757
00:50:25,891 --> 00:50:28,445
He wrote it, but he<br/>probably plugs that word in.

758
00:50:28,643 --> 00:50:30,814
You know, whatever, "milk shake. "

759
00:50:31,012 --> 00:50:32,539
What do you mean?

760
00:50:32,738 --> 00:50:34,844
Nothing. I loved it. It was great.

761
00:50:42,275 --> 00:50:44,697
You know what drives me crazy?<br/>People talking about...

762
00:50:44,899 --> 00:50:47,485
...how great technology is,<br/>how it saves all this time.

763
00:50:47,683 --> 00:50:50,553
But what good is saved time<br/>if nobody uses it?

764
00:50:50,755 --> 00:50:52,991
If it just turns into more busy work.

765
00:50:53,187 --> 00:50:57,443
I never hear anybody say, "With the time<br/>I've saved using my word processor...

766
00:50:57,635 --> 00:51:00,417
...I'm gonna go to a Zen monastery<br/>and hang out. "

767
00:51:00,771 --> 00:51:03,640
- You don't hear that.<br/>- Time is so abstract anyway.

768
00:51:03,875 --> 00:51:06,362
- Are you looking at this girl?<br/>- What?

769
00:51:06,562 --> 00:51:07,872
Nothing.

770
00:51:08,483 --> 00:51:09,857
You wanna go in here?

771
00:51:10,051 --> 00:51:13,367
- You wanna go in here?<br/>- Yeah. It's a club, no?

772
00:51:15,394 --> 00:51:16,343
Wanna go?

773
00:51:16,546 --> 00:51:17,594
Hello.

774
00:51:19,394 --> 00:51:21,150
Fifty schillings.

775
00:51:21,346 --> 00:51:24,128
- Each.<br/>- I got 100. Here, I got it.

776
00:51:24,930 --> 00:51:27,003
I'll buy you a beer. Thank you.

777
00:52:13,026 --> 00:52:15,164
- You gonna buy me a beer?<br/>- Yeah.

778
00:52:18,913 --> 00:52:21,499
You think Old Milwaukee<br/>is expensive here?

779
00:52:48,257 --> 00:52:51,901
We haven't talked about this yet,<br/>but are you dating anyone?

780
00:52:52,096 --> 00:52:56,286
You got a boyfriend waiting on you<br/>back in Paris or anything like that?

781
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:59,163
- No, not right now.<br/>- But you did.

782
00:53:00,513 --> 00:53:02,138
We broke up six months ago.

783
00:53:02,337 --> 00:53:04,726
Six months ago? Oh, I'm sorry.

784
00:53:04,928 --> 00:53:07,546
I mean, I'm not that sorry.<br/>Tell me about it.

785
00:53:07,744 --> 00:53:11,357
No way. I can't.<br/>It's really, really boring.

786
00:53:11,552 --> 00:53:13,440
Come on. Tell me about it.

787
00:53:15,616 --> 00:53:17,307
I was really disappointed.

788
00:53:17,504 --> 00:53:20,406
I thought this one would last<br/>for a while. He was...

789
00:53:20,833 --> 00:53:24,510
...very stupid, ugly,<br/>bad in bed, alcoholic...

790
00:53:25,377 --> 00:53:27,864
- You know.<br/>- A real prize winner.

791
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:30,783
I was kind of giving him a favor.

792
00:53:30,976 --> 00:53:33,627
But he left me,<br/>saying I loved him too much.

793
00:53:33,823 --> 00:53:38,362
I was blocking his artistic expression<br/>or some shit like that.

794
00:53:39,072 --> 00:53:41,560
But anyway, I was traumatized<br/>and became...

795
00:53:42,144 --> 00:53:44,283
And became totally obsessed with him.

796
00:53:44,768 --> 00:53:47,767
So I went to a shrink, and it came up<br/>that I had written...

797
00:53:47,967 --> 00:53:52,245
...this stupid story about this<br/>woman trying to kill her boyfriend...

798
00:53:53,247 --> 00:53:54,491
...and how she'd do it.

799
00:53:54,687 --> 00:53:57,884
It's all the details<br/>of how to do it and not get caught...

800
00:53:58,079 --> 00:53:59,989
She was gonna kill her boyfriend?

801
00:54:01,919 --> 00:54:05,977
Yeah, she was. It's nothing I would do,<br/>but it was just some writing.

802
00:54:06,175 --> 00:54:07,386
No, I understand.

803
00:54:07,583 --> 00:54:10,300
This stupid shrink believed<br/>everything I told her.

804
00:54:10,495 --> 00:54:14,041
It was my first time seeing her.<br/>She said she had to call the police.

805
00:54:14,238 --> 00:54:16,061
She had to call the police?

806
00:54:17,695 --> 00:54:20,378
She was totally convinced<br/>I was really gonna do it.

807
00:54:20,575 --> 00:54:23,390
Even though I had explained<br/>it was just some writing.

808
00:54:23,583 --> 00:54:26,398
She said, looking into my eyes,<br/>"The way you said it...

809
00:54:26,591 --> 00:54:28,380
...I know you are going to do it. "

810
00:54:28,575 --> 00:54:31,030
She was totally out of her mind.

811
00:54:31,807 --> 00:54:34,262
It was my first and last session.

812
00:54:34,462 --> 00:54:36,153
So what happened then?

813
00:54:37,984 --> 00:54:39,958
I totally got over him.

814
00:54:40,383 --> 00:54:41,659
But now, I'm obsessed...

815
00:54:41,854 --> 00:54:46,165
...that he's gonna die from<br/>an accident or 1000 kilometers away.

816
00:54:46,494 --> 00:54:48,600
And I'm gonna be the one accused.

817
00:54:50,974 --> 00:54:53,625
Why is it you become obsessed<br/>with people you don't...

818
00:54:53,822 --> 00:54:55,480
...really like that much?

819
00:54:55,678 --> 00:54:56,987
I don't know.

820
00:54:59,326 --> 00:55:00,254
So how about you?

821
00:55:02,142 --> 00:55:04,281
- What?<br/>- Are you with anyone?

822
00:55:06,110 --> 00:55:09,722
It's funny how we managed to avoid<br/>this subject for so long.

823
00:55:09,917 --> 00:55:11,608
But now you have to tell me.

824
00:55:11,806 --> 00:55:13,911
Well, I kind of see love...

825
00:55:14,110 --> 00:55:18,169
...as this escape for two people<br/>who don't know how to be alone.

826
00:55:19,902 --> 00:55:22,269
It's funny.<br/>People always talk about how...

827
00:55:22,462 --> 00:55:25,145
...love is this totally unselfish,<br/>giving thing.

828
00:55:25,342 --> 00:55:28,473
But if you think about it,<br/>there's nothing more selfish.

829
00:55:29,277 --> 00:55:30,487
I know.

830
00:55:31,293 --> 00:55:33,148
So who just broke up with you?

831
00:55:35,005 --> 00:55:36,119
What?

832
00:55:38,333 --> 00:55:40,537
You sound like you just were hurt.

833
00:55:40,734 --> 00:55:41,977
Do I?

834
00:55:42,238 --> 00:55:43,448
All right.

835
00:55:44,574 --> 00:55:45,948
Big confession.

836
00:55:46,653 --> 00:55:49,141
I should've told you this<br/>earlier or something.

837
00:55:50,110 --> 00:55:52,476
I didn't come to Europe just to...

838
00:55:52,668 --> 00:55:55,735
...hang out and read Hemingway in Paris<br/>and shit like that.

839
00:55:56,445 --> 00:55:59,610
I saved up my money all spring to<br/>fly to Madrid...

840
00:55:59,805 --> 00:56:02,260
...and spend the summer<br/>with my girlfriend...

841
00:56:02,462 --> 00:56:04,120
- Your girlfriend?<br/>- My ex-girlfriend...

842
00:56:04,317 --> 00:56:07,513
...who has been on this art history<br/>program for the last year.

843
00:56:07,709 --> 00:56:10,971
Anyway, I got here.<br/>We were reunited at long last...

844
00:56:11,165 --> 00:56:15,125
...and we went out to dinner our<br/>first night with six of her friends.

845
00:56:15,324 --> 00:56:17,845
Pedro, Antonio, Gonzalo...

846
00:56:18,045 --> 00:56:20,117
...Maria, Suzy from home.

847
00:56:20,316 --> 00:56:23,545
She managed to avoid being alone<br/>with me for the first few days...

848
00:56:23,740 --> 00:56:28,180
...and I stuck around just to let it<br/>sink in that she wished I hadn't come.

849
00:56:29,885 --> 00:56:33,496
So I bought the cheapest flight out,<br/>this one leaving out of Vienna.

850
00:56:33,692 --> 00:56:37,041
It didn't leave for a couple weeks,<br/>so I bought this Eurail pass.

851
00:56:37,692 --> 00:56:41,653
You know what's the worst thing<br/>about somebody breaking up with you?

852
00:56:43,484 --> 00:56:46,168
It's when you remember<br/>how little you thought about...

853
00:56:46,364 --> 00:56:48,983
...the people you broke up with,<br/>and you realize...

854
00:56:49,180 --> 00:56:52,661
...that that is how little<br/>they're thinking about you.

855
00:56:52,860 --> 00:56:55,064
You'd like to think<br/>you're both in pain...

856
00:56:55,261 --> 00:56:58,130
...but really, they're just,<br/>"Hey, I'm glad you're gone. "

857
00:56:58,332 --> 00:57:00,666
Believe me, I know.

858
00:57:00,892 --> 00:57:02,801
You should look at bright colors.

859
00:57:04,444 --> 00:57:06,233
That's what the shrink told me.

860
00:57:06,428 --> 00:57:08,916
I was paying her 900 francs an hour...

861
00:57:09,116 --> 00:57:11,320
...to hear that I<br/>was a homicidal maniac...

862
00:57:11,516 --> 00:57:15,411
...but I could shift my obsession if I<br/>would concentrate on bright colors.

863
00:57:15,612 --> 00:57:16,822
Did it work?

864
00:57:20,220 --> 00:57:22,194
- Didn't help your pinball.<br/>- Well, no.

865
00:57:22,780 --> 00:57:26,424
Yeah, well, you know,<br/>I haven't killed anyone lately.

866
00:57:26,619 --> 00:57:27,896
Not lately?

867
00:57:28,188 --> 00:57:30,009
That's good.<br/>You're cured then.

868
00:57:36,187 --> 00:57:39,287
There's breeds of monkeys,<br/>and all they do is have sex...

869
00:57:39,611 --> 00:57:40,986
...all the time.

870
00:57:41,179 --> 00:57:43,318
And they turn out to be<br/>the least violent...

871
00:57:43,515 --> 00:57:46,362
...the most peaceful, the most happy.

872
00:57:46,555 --> 00:57:48,943
So maybe fooling around's<br/>not so bad.

873
00:57:49,147 --> 00:57:52,147
- Are you talking about monkeys?<br/>- Yes, I am.

874
00:57:52,347 --> 00:57:53,656
- I thought so.<br/>- Why?

875
00:57:53,851 --> 00:57:57,397
I never heard this one.<br/>But it reminds me of this perfect...

876
00:57:57,595 --> 00:57:59,930
...male argument to justify them<br/>fooling around.

877
00:58:00,123 --> 00:58:03,418
Women monkeys are fooling around too.<br/>Everybody's fooling around.

878
00:58:05,179 --> 00:58:08,594
That's cute. I have this awful,<br/>paranoid thought...

879
00:58:08,794 --> 00:58:11,861
...that feminism was mostly invented<br/>by men so they could...

880
00:58:12,059 --> 00:58:13,303
...fool around more.

881
00:58:13,499 --> 00:58:16,531
"Woman, free your mind,<br/>free your body. Sleep with me.

882
00:58:16,730 --> 00:58:21,072
We're all happy and free, as long as<br/>I can fuck as much as I can. "

883
00:58:21,851 --> 00:58:22,744
All right.

884
00:58:22,938 --> 00:58:26,102
But maybe there's some<br/>biological things at work here.

885
00:58:26,299 --> 00:58:27,760
If you had an island...

886
00:58:27,963 --> 00:58:32,403
...and there were 99 women<br/>on the island and only one man...

887
00:58:32,602 --> 00:58:35,286
...in a year, you'd have<br/>the possibility of 99 babies.

888
00:58:35,482 --> 00:58:38,646
But if you have an island<br/>with 99 men and only one woman...

889
00:58:38,841 --> 00:58:43,314
...in a year, you have the possibility<br/>of only one baby. So...

890
00:58:43,610 --> 00:58:44,537
You know what?

891
00:58:44,730 --> 00:58:48,723
On this island, I think there<br/>will be only, like, maybe 43 men left.

892
00:58:48,922 --> 00:58:52,664
They would've killed each other<br/>trying to fuck this poor woman.

893
00:58:52,857 --> 00:58:56,916
And on the other island,<br/>there would be 99 women, 99 babies...

894
00:58:57,114 --> 00:58:58,707
...and no more man.

895
00:58:58,906 --> 00:59:01,361
Because they would've all<br/>eaten him alive.

896
00:59:01,562 --> 00:59:02,904
Oh, yeah?

897
00:59:03,097 --> 00:59:04,755
There's something to that.

898
00:59:04,954 --> 00:59:08,947
On some level, women don't mind<br/>the idea of destroying a man.

899
00:59:10,105 --> 00:59:12,855
I was walking down the street<br/>with my ex-girlfriend...

900
00:59:13,049 --> 00:59:17,359
...and we'd just walked by these four<br/>thuggy-looking guys next to a Camaro.

901
00:59:17,561 --> 00:59:20,595
And one of them says,<br/>"Hey, baby. Nice ass!"

902
00:59:20,794 --> 00:59:24,306
So I'm like, "No big deal.<br/>I won't get uptight about this. "

903
00:59:24,506 --> 00:59:26,000
Plus, there were four of them.

904
00:59:26,201 --> 00:59:29,049
Exactly. But she says,<br/>"Fuck you, dickheads!"

905
00:59:29,241 --> 00:59:32,308
And I'm like, "Okay.<br/>Wait a minute, here. "

906
00:59:32,505 --> 00:59:34,960
They're not gonna come over<br/>and kick her ass.

907
00:59:35,162 --> 00:59:37,976
So who just got pushed<br/>to the frontline on that one?

908
00:59:38,168 --> 00:59:41,016
Women say they hate it<br/>if you're all protective.

909
00:59:41,209 --> 00:59:45,399
But if it suits them, then<br/>they'll tell you you're being unmanly.

910
00:59:45,592 --> 00:59:49,553
You know what? I don't think<br/>woman really wants to destroy man.

911
00:59:50,425 --> 00:59:52,694
Even if they want to,<br/>they don't succeed.

912
00:59:52,889 --> 00:59:54,994
I'm sure even men are<br/>destroying women...

913
00:59:55,192 --> 00:59:58,127
...or are capable of destroying women<br/>much more than women...

914
00:59:58,328 --> 01:00:00,532
Anyway, it's depressing.<br/>You know what?

915
01:00:00,729 --> 01:00:03,217
- You wanna stop talking about this?<br/>- I hate it.

916
01:00:03,417 --> 01:00:04,912
Men, women, it's...

917
01:00:05,112 --> 01:00:07,501
There's no end to it.

918
01:00:08,024 --> 01:00:09,452
It's like a skipping record.

919
01:00:09,656 --> 01:00:12,723
Every couple's been having<br/>this conversation forever.

920
01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:14,927
And nobody came up with anything.

921
01:00:30,904 --> 01:00:33,239
I saw a documentary on that.<br/>It's a birth dance.

922
01:00:33,431 --> 01:00:34,838
A birth dance?

923
01:01:02,135 --> 01:01:03,728
Should I give her some money?

924
01:01:04,311 --> 01:01:07,093
Everything that's interesting<br/>costs a little money.

925
01:01:08,951 --> 01:01:10,477
So a birth dance, huh?

926
01:01:10,679 --> 01:01:13,297
Looked a little bit<br/>like a mating dance to me.

927
01:01:13,495 --> 01:01:16,179
No, but really.<br/>Women used it when giving birth.

928
01:01:16,375 --> 01:01:18,678
In part of the world,<br/>they still do it.

929
01:01:19,864 --> 01:01:22,230
The woman in labor enters a tent...

930
01:01:22,423 --> 01:01:24,910
...and the women of her tribe<br/>surround her and dance.

931
01:01:25,111 --> 01:01:27,315
They encourage her<br/>to dance with them...

932
01:01:27,511 --> 01:01:29,715
...so as to make<br/>the birth less painful.

933
01:01:29,911 --> 01:01:33,206
And when the baby is born,<br/>they all dance in celebration.

934
01:01:34,295 --> 01:01:36,466
I don't think my mom<br/>would've gone for that.

935
01:01:36,983 --> 01:01:41,009
I like the idea of dancing as something<br/>everybody participates in.

936
01:01:41,207 --> 01:01:44,207
I know. I heard about this old guy...

937
01:01:44,407 --> 01:01:46,446
...who was watching<br/>some young people dance.

938
01:01:46,646 --> 01:01:47,987
He said, "How beautiful.

939
01:01:48,182 --> 01:01:50,997
They're shaking off their genitals<br/>to become angels. "

940
01:01:51,190 --> 01:01:52,051
I like that.

941
01:01:52,247 --> 01:01:53,391
One question, though.

942
01:01:53,590 --> 01:01:57,103
When the women are dancing<br/>and being all spiritual and stuff...

943
01:01:57,303 --> 01:01:58,350
...where are the men?

944
01:01:58,551 --> 01:02:02,674
Are we out food gathering? Are we not<br/>invited? You all don't need us?

945
01:02:02,869 --> 01:02:05,074
Men are lucky we don't<br/>bite off their heads after mating.

946
01:02:05,271 --> 01:02:08,118
Certain insects do that,<br/>like spiders and stuff?

947
01:02:08,310 --> 01:02:10,612
We let you live.<br/>What are you complaining about?

948
01:02:10,806 --> 01:02:14,286
See, you're officially kidding.<br/>But there's something to that.

949
01:02:14,485 --> 01:02:16,525
You keep bringing stuff like that up.

950
01:02:17,142 --> 01:02:20,404
No, no. Wait a minute.<br/>Talking seriously here.

951
01:02:20,597 --> 01:02:23,380
I mean, I always feel<br/>this pressure of being...

952
01:02:23,574 --> 01:02:26,094
...a strong and independent<br/>icon of womanhood...

953
01:02:26,294 --> 01:02:28,236
...and not making it look like...

954
01:02:28,437 --> 01:02:31,404
...my whole life is revolving<br/>around some guy.

955
01:02:32,917 --> 01:02:34,194
But loving someone...

956
01:02:34,389 --> 01:02:37,684
...and being loved<br/>means so much to me.

957
01:02:38,326 --> 01:02:40,562
I always make fun of it and stuff...

958
01:02:41,526 --> 01:02:43,467
...but isn't everything<br/>we do in life...

959
01:02:43,669 --> 01:02:46,419
...a way to be loved a little more?

960
01:02:50,613 --> 01:02:51,857
I don't know.

961
01:02:52,277 --> 01:02:54,132
Sometimes I dream...

962
01:02:54,326 --> 01:02:57,228
...about being a good father<br/>and a good husband.

963
01:02:57,429 --> 01:02:59,795
And sometimes it feels really close.

964
01:03:00,437 --> 01:03:02,259
But then other times...

965
01:03:03,286 --> 01:03:05,227
...it seems silly...

966
01:03:05,429 --> 01:03:06,835
...like it would...

967
01:03:07,188 --> 01:03:08,912
...ruin my whole life.

968
01:03:09,557 --> 01:03:12,590
And it's not just<br/>a fear of commitment...

969
01:03:12,789 --> 01:03:15,788
...or that I'm incapable<br/>of caring or loving because...

970
01:03:15,989 --> 01:03:17,166
...I can.

971
01:03:18,037 --> 01:03:21,997
It's just that, if I'm<br/>totally honest with myself...

972
01:03:22,261 --> 01:03:23,854
...I think I'd rather die knowing...

973
01:03:24,053 --> 01:03:26,475
...that I was<br/>really good at something.

974
01:03:26,677 --> 01:03:29,393
That I had excelled<br/>in some way...

975
01:03:29,620 --> 01:03:31,443
...than that I'd just been in...

976
01:03:31,636 --> 01:03:34,799
...a nice, caring relationship.

977
01:03:40,756 --> 01:03:44,018
I had worked for this older man,<br/>and once he told me...

978
01:03:44,213 --> 01:03:47,726
...that he had spent all of his life<br/>thinking about his career.

979
01:03:47,925 --> 01:03:50,128
He was 52,<br/>and it suddenly struck him...

980
01:03:50,740 --> 01:03:53,838
...that he had never really<br/>given anything of himself.

981
01:03:54,164 --> 01:03:56,499
His life was for no one and nothing.

982
01:03:57,749 --> 01:03:59,984
He was almost crying saying that.

983
01:04:02,867 --> 01:04:05,235
I believe if there's<br/>any kind of God...

984
01:04:05,428 --> 01:04:07,337
...it wouldn't be in any of us...

985
01:04:07,636 --> 01:04:09,458
...not you or me...

986
01:04:10,196 --> 01:04:13,195
...but just this little space<br/>in between.

987
01:04:15,571 --> 01:04:18,027
If there's any kind of magic<br/>in this world...

988
01:04:18,227 --> 01:04:22,450
...it must be in the attempt of<br/>understanding someone sharing something.

989
01:04:24,628 --> 01:04:27,792
I know, it's almost<br/>impossible to succeed...

990
01:04:28,595 --> 01:04:30,254
...but who cares really?

991
01:04:31,315 --> 01:04:33,650
The answer must be in the attempt.

992
01:05:39,313 --> 01:05:42,926
I think this is a civilization in<br/>decline. Look at the service.

993
01:05:43,122 --> 01:05:46,417
Where is the waitress?<br/>In New York, she'd be out of a job.

994
01:05:55,154 --> 01:05:57,226
I'm gonna call my friend in Paris...

995
01:05:57,394 --> 01:06:00,394
...who I'm supposed to have<br/>lunch with in eight hours.

996
01:06:08,273 --> 01:06:09,451
Pick up.

997
01:06:09,650 --> 01:06:11,504
- Pick up the phone.<br/>- All right.

998
01:06:24,018 --> 01:06:27,760
I've been working on my English.<br/>You wanna talk in English, for laughs?

999
01:06:28,177 --> 01:06:30,478
Yeah, okay. That's a good idea.

1000
01:06:32,145 --> 01:06:35,494
I don't think I'll be able to<br/>make it for lunch today.

1001
01:06:37,072 --> 01:06:40,684
I met a guy on the train,<br/>and I got off with him in Vienna.

1002
01:06:40,913 --> 01:06:42,822
Are you crazy?

1003
01:06:43,825 --> 01:06:45,167
Probably.

1004
01:06:45,617 --> 01:06:48,518
- He's Austrian? He's from there?<br/>- No, No.

1005
01:06:48,721 --> 01:06:52,266
He's passing through. He's American.<br/>He's going back home tomorrow.

1006
01:06:52,465 --> 01:06:53,774
Why'd you get off?

1007
01:06:54,929 --> 01:06:57,263
Well, he convinced me.

1008
01:06:58,161 --> 01:07:01,772
I mean, actually, I was ready to<br/>get off the train with him...

1009
01:07:01,969 --> 01:07:03,856
...after talking to him a short while.

1010
01:07:04,048 --> 01:07:05,990
He was so sweet, I couldn't help it.

1011
01:07:07,344 --> 01:07:09,678
In the lounge car,<br/>he began to talk about...

1012
01:07:09,873 --> 01:07:12,839
...him as a boy seeing<br/>his great-grandmother's ghost.

1013
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:16,299
I think that's when I fell for him.

1014
01:07:17,361 --> 01:07:21,038
Just the idea of this little boy<br/>with all those beautiful dreams.

1015
01:07:22,448 --> 01:07:24,008
He trapped me.

1016
01:07:27,088 --> 01:07:28,713
And he's so cute.

1017
01:07:28,911 --> 01:07:30,984
He has beautiful blue eyes...

1018
01:07:31,184 --> 01:07:33,093
...nice pink lips...

1019
01:07:33,903 --> 01:07:35,430
...greasy hair.

1020
01:07:36,112 --> 01:07:37,638
I love it.

1021
01:07:37,999 --> 01:07:40,716
He's kind of tall,<br/>and he's a little clumsy.

1022
01:07:42,320 --> 01:07:44,654
I like to feel his eyes on me<br/>when I look away.

1023
01:07:49,167 --> 01:07:52,134
He kind of kisses like an adolescent.<br/>It's so cute.

1024
01:07:52,336 --> 01:07:55,750
- What?<br/>- Yeah, we kissed. It was so adorable.

1025
01:07:56,655 --> 01:07:59,622
As the night went on,<br/>I began to like him more and more.

1026
01:08:01,391 --> 01:08:02,951
I'm afraid he's scared of me.

1027
01:08:03,151 --> 01:08:06,948
I told him the story about<br/>the woman that kills her ex-boyfriend.

1028
01:08:07,439 --> 01:08:08,847
He must be scared to death.

1029
01:08:09,039 --> 01:08:12,171
He must be thinking I'm<br/>this manipulative, mean woman.

1030
01:08:14,351 --> 01:08:16,740
I just hope he doesn't feel<br/>that way about me.

1031
01:08:16,943 --> 01:08:19,791
Because, you know me,<br/>I'm the most harmless person.

1032
01:08:21,232 --> 01:08:24,013
The only person I could<br/>really hurt is myself.

1033
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:26,701
I don't think he's scared of you.

1034
01:08:26,895 --> 01:08:28,652
I think he's crazy about you.

1035
01:08:29,263 --> 01:08:31,270
- Really?<br/>- I've known you a long time.

1036
01:08:31,471 --> 01:08:33,838
I got a good feeling.<br/>You gonna see him again?

1037
01:08:36,495 --> 01:08:38,829
We haven't talked about that yet.

1038
01:08:43,311 --> 01:08:45,897
Okay, it's your turn.<br/>You call your friend.

1039
01:08:46,095 --> 01:08:47,917
All right, all right.

1040
01:08:51,182 --> 01:08:53,604
I usually get this guy's<br/>answering machine.

1041
01:08:56,207 --> 01:08:57,767
Hi, dude. What's up?

1042
01:08:59,630 --> 01:09:02,347
Hey, Frank. How you been?<br/>I'm glad you're home.

1043
01:09:02,542 --> 01:09:03,916
Cool. Yeah.

1044
01:09:04,110 --> 01:09:05,604
So how was Madrid?

1045
01:09:06,254 --> 01:09:08,261
Madrid sucked.

1046
01:09:08,910 --> 01:09:11,463
Lisa and I had our<br/>long overdue meltdown.

1047
01:09:11,981 --> 01:09:13,804
Too bad. I told you, no?

1048
01:09:13,998 --> 01:09:17,031
Yeah, yeah. The long-distance thing<br/>just never works.

1049
01:09:17,230 --> 01:09:19,171
I was only in Madrid<br/>for a couple days.

1050
01:09:19,374 --> 01:09:21,926
I got a cheaper flight out of Vienna.

1051
01:09:23,854 --> 01:09:26,952
You know, it really wasn't<br/>that much cheaper. I just...

1052
01:09:27,150 --> 01:09:31,208
I couldn't go home right away.<br/>I didn't want to see anybody I knew.

1053
01:09:31,405 --> 01:09:34,057
I just wanted to be a ghost,<br/>completely anonymous.

1054
01:09:35,662 --> 01:09:36,938
So are you okay now?

1055
01:09:37,134 --> 01:09:40,036
Yeah. I'm great. I'm great.<br/>That's the thing.

1056
01:09:40,621 --> 01:09:41,549
I'm rapturous.

1057
01:09:42,221 --> 01:09:43,651
And I'll tell you why.

1058
01:09:43,854 --> 01:09:46,636
I met somebody<br/>on my last night in Europe.

1059
01:09:46,830 --> 01:09:49,416
- That's incredible.<br/>- I know, I know.

1060
01:09:49,614 --> 01:09:52,842
You know how they say we're all<br/>each other's demons and angels?

1061
01:09:53,837 --> 01:09:57,066
Well, she was literally<br/>a Botticelli angel...

1062
01:09:57,837 --> 01:09:59,780
...telling me everything<br/>would be okay.

1063
01:10:02,669 --> 01:10:03,782
How did you meet?

1064
01:10:05,325 --> 01:10:06,733
On the train.

1065
01:10:07,182 --> 01:10:10,214
She was sitting next to<br/>a weird couple that was fighting...

1066
01:10:10,413 --> 01:10:13,446
...so she moved. She sat<br/>right across the aisle from me.

1067
01:10:13,645 --> 01:10:15,499
So we started to talk.

1068
01:10:15,693 --> 01:10:17,798
She didn't like me much at first.

1069
01:10:17,997 --> 01:10:19,110
She's super smart...

1070
01:10:19,757 --> 01:10:21,896
...very passionate...

1071
01:10:22,445 --> 01:10:23,590
...and beautiful.

1072
01:10:25,069 --> 01:10:27,457
And I was so unsure of myself.

1073
01:10:27,757 --> 01:10:30,375
I thought everything I said<br/>sounded so stupid.

1074
01:10:32,172 --> 01:10:35,074
Oh, man. I wouldn't worry about that.

1075
01:10:35,660 --> 01:10:37,831
No, I'm sure she was not judging you.

1076
01:10:38,317 --> 01:10:40,521
No, and by the way,<br/>she sat next to you.

1077
01:10:40,716 --> 01:10:42,374
I'm sure she did it on purpose.

1078
01:10:42,572 --> 01:10:43,849
Oh, yeah?

1079
01:10:47,468 --> 01:10:51,112
Us men are so stupid. We don't<br/>understand anything about women.

1080
01:10:52,332 --> 01:10:54,721
They act strange,<br/>the little I know of them.

1081
01:10:55,308 --> 01:10:56,552
Don't they?

1082
01:11:03,307 --> 01:11:07,050
I feel like this is<br/>some dream world we're in.

1083
01:11:07,244 --> 01:11:08,770
Yeah, it's so weird.

1084
01:11:09,163 --> 01:11:11,269
It's like our time together<br/>is just ours.

1085
01:11:11,468 --> 01:11:13,223
It's our own creation.

1086
01:11:13,932 --> 01:11:16,834
It must be like I'm in your dream<br/>and you're in mine.

1087
01:11:17,676 --> 01:11:20,840
And what's so cool<br/>is that this whole evening...

1088
01:11:21,035 --> 01:11:24,384
...all our time together,<br/>shouldn't officially be happening.

1089
01:11:24,588 --> 01:11:27,904
Yeah, I know. Maybe that's why<br/>this feels so otherworldly.

1090
01:11:29,931 --> 01:11:33,379
But then the morning comes<br/>and we turn into pumpkins, right?

1091
01:11:34,092 --> 01:11:35,465
I know.

1092
01:11:36,556 --> 01:11:39,238
But now, you're supposed to<br/>produce the glass slipper...

1093
01:11:39,435 --> 01:11:40,962
...and see if it fits.

1094
01:11:43,979 --> 01:11:45,289
It'll fit.

1095
01:12:03,052 --> 01:12:04,677
<i>This friend of mine had a kid... </i>

1096
01:12:04,874 --> 01:12:07,973
...and it was a home birth,<br/>so he was there helping out.

1097
01:12:08,170 --> 01:12:10,854
But he said at that<br/>profound moment of birth...

1098
01:12:12,266 --> 01:12:15,878
...he was watching his child<br/>experiencing life for the first time...

1099
01:12:16,075 --> 01:12:17,929
...trying to take its first breath.

1100
01:12:18,122 --> 01:12:21,505
All he could think about was<br/>that he was looking at something...

1101
01:12:21,706 --> 01:12:23,649
...that was gonna die someday.

1102
01:12:23,978 --> 01:12:25,985
He couldn't get it out of his head.

1103
01:12:26,698 --> 01:12:30,146
And I think that's so true.<br/>Everything is so finite.

1104
01:12:30,410 --> 01:12:33,061
But don't you think that's what...

1105
01:12:33,258 --> 01:12:36,454
...makes our time and specific moments<br/>so important?

1106
01:12:36,651 --> 01:12:37,479
Yeah, I know.

1107
01:12:37,834 --> 01:12:39,906
It's the same for us tonight, though.

1108
01:12:42,762 --> 01:12:46,276
After tomorrow, we'll probably<br/>never see each other again, right?

1109
01:12:48,138 --> 01:12:50,243
You don't think we'll<br/>ever see each other?

1110
01:12:52,810 --> 01:12:54,020
What do you think?

1111
01:13:00,105 --> 01:13:01,567
Actually, I don't know.

1112
01:13:02,602 --> 01:13:03,779
I hadn't planned another...

1113
01:13:03,978 --> 01:13:07,393
Me too. I live in Paris,<br/>you live in the U.S. I understand.

1114
01:13:07,593 --> 01:13:10,245
I'd hate to make you fly.<br/>You'd hate to fly, right?

1115
01:13:10,602 --> 01:13:12,577
I'm not so scared of flying.

1116
01:13:13,418 --> 01:13:14,399
I mean, I could.

1117
01:13:14,601 --> 01:13:16,227
Well, if you were gonna...

1118
01:13:16,489 --> 01:13:17,951
...come to the U. S...

1119
01:13:18,185 --> 01:13:19,527
...or if, you know, if I...

1120
01:13:19,722 --> 01:13:22,056
I mean, I could come back here.

1121
01:13:23,081 --> 01:13:24,194
What?

1122
01:13:25,002 --> 01:13:28,100
No, let's just be rational adults<br/>about this.

1123
01:13:30,920 --> 01:13:32,546
We should try something different.

1124
01:13:32,745 --> 01:13:35,843
It's not so bad if tonight<br/>is our only night, right?

1125
01:13:37,096 --> 01:13:38,919
People exchange numbers, addresses.

1126
01:13:39,112 --> 01:13:41,830
They end up writing once,<br/>calling each other twice.

1127
01:13:42,025 --> 01:13:43,716
Right. Fizzles out.

1128
01:13:44,009 --> 01:13:46,398
Yeah, I don't want that.<br/>I hate that.

1129
01:13:47,368 --> 01:13:48,896
I hate that too.

1130
01:13:49,480 --> 01:13:52,645
Why does everybody think<br/>relationships should last forever?

1131
01:13:52,873 --> 01:13:54,880
Yeah, why? It's stupid.

1132
01:13:56,617 --> 01:13:59,104
But you think tonight's it?

1133
01:13:59,368 --> 01:14:02,717
I mean, that tonight's our only night?

1134
01:14:04,649 --> 01:14:06,623
It's the only way, no?

1135
01:14:09,609 --> 01:14:10,885
Well, all right.

1136
01:14:12,360 --> 01:14:13,570
Let's do it.

1137
01:14:13,896 --> 01:14:16,133
No delusions, no projections.

1138
01:14:17,480 --> 01:14:19,390
We'll just make tonight great.

1139
01:14:21,992 --> 01:14:23,138
Let's do that.

1140
01:14:39,912 --> 01:14:42,051
We should do some kind of handshake.

1141
01:14:42,504 --> 01:14:43,715
Give me your hand.

1142
01:14:47,048 --> 01:14:49,863
To our one and only...

1143
01:14:50,663 --> 01:14:52,092
...night together...

1144
01:14:52,808 --> 01:14:55,263
...and the hours that remain.

1145
01:15:03,528 --> 01:15:04,509
What?

1146
01:15:07,208 --> 01:15:08,452
It's just...

1147
01:15:08,807 --> 01:15:10,531
It's depressing, no?

1148
01:15:11,495 --> 01:15:14,146
Now, the only thing<br/>we're gonna think of is...

1149
01:15:14,342 --> 01:15:16,197
...when we'll have to say goodbye.

1150
01:15:16,967 --> 01:15:19,837
We could say goodbye now.<br/>Then we won't worry about it.

1151
01:15:20,231 --> 01:15:21,311
Now?

1152
01:15:22,087 --> 01:15:23,199
Say goodbye.

1153
01:15:23,399 --> 01:15:24,828
- Bye.<br/>- Goodbye.

1154
01:15:26,343 --> 01:15:27,270
<i>Au revoir. </i>

1155
01:15:27,463 --> 01:15:29,154
- Later.<br/>- Later, yeah.

1156
01:15:58,247 --> 01:15:59,262
Here's the plan.

1157
01:15:59,462 --> 01:16:02,625
You're gonna grab the glasses,<br/>and I'm gonna get the wine.

1158
01:16:03,110 --> 01:16:04,735
- Red wine.<br/>- Red wine. Right.

1159
01:16:04,934 --> 01:16:07,933
- You think you can do that?<br/>- No problem.

1160
01:16:12,549 --> 01:16:14,721
- Wish me luck.<br/>- Good luck.

1161
01:16:16,583 --> 01:16:17,662
Hello.

1162
01:16:21,990 --> 01:16:23,234
Do you speak English?

1163
01:16:23,430 --> 01:16:25,404
- A bit.<br/>- Yeah? A bit?

1164
01:16:25,606 --> 01:16:28,127
I'm having kind of an odd situation...

1165
01:16:28,325 --> 01:16:30,049
...which is that...

1166
01:16:30,374 --> 01:16:32,229
You see that girl over there?

1167
01:16:36,453 --> 01:16:38,821
Well, this is our only night together...

1168
01:16:39,462 --> 01:16:40,923
...and she...

1169
01:16:42,917 --> 01:16:46,081
The problem is that she wants<br/>a bottle of red wine...

1170
01:16:46,277 --> 01:16:48,349
...and I don't have any money.

1171
01:16:50,661 --> 01:16:53,028
But I was thinking<br/>that you might want to...

1172
01:16:54,022 --> 01:16:57,436
...give me the address of this bar,<br/>and I would promise...

1173
01:16:57,828 --> 01:17:01,124
...to send you the money, and you'd<br/>be making our night complete.

1174
01:17:01,317 --> 01:17:03,171
You would send me the money?

1175
01:17:09,029 --> 01:17:10,239
Your hand?

1176
01:17:25,765 --> 01:17:28,033
For the greatest night in your life.

1177
01:17:28,229 --> 01:17:29,855
Thank you very much.

1178
01:17:52,581 --> 01:17:56,028
So often I've been with people<br/>and shared beautiful moments...

1179
01:17:56,228 --> 01:18:00,122
...like traveling or staying up<br/>all night and watching the sunrise.

1180
01:18:00,964 --> 01:18:03,419
And I knew those were special moments.

1181
01:18:04,004 --> 01:18:06,143
But something was always wrong.

1182
01:18:07,236 --> 01:18:09,375
I wished I'd been with someone else.

1183
01:18:11,076 --> 01:18:13,149
I knew that what I was feeling...

1184
01:18:13,348 --> 01:18:17,243
...exactly what was so important to me,<br/>they didn't understand.

1185
01:18:21,732 --> 01:18:23,641
But I'm happy to be with you.

1186
01:18:26,276 --> 01:18:28,642
You couldn't know<br/>why a night like this...

1187
01:18:28,836 --> 01:18:31,224
...is so important<br/>to my life right now...

1188
01:18:31,427 --> 01:18:32,769
...but it is.

1189
01:18:35,747 --> 01:18:37,634
This is a great morning.

1190
01:18:38,179 --> 01:18:39,870
It is a great morning.

1191
01:18:42,084 --> 01:18:44,287
Do you think we have others like this?

1192
01:18:47,139 --> 01:18:50,139
What about our rational, adult decision?

1193
01:18:50,339 --> 01:18:51,932
Oh, yeah.

1194
01:18:56,131 --> 01:18:59,230
I know what you mean about wishing<br/>somebody wasn't there.

1195
01:19:00,227 --> 01:19:02,082
It's just, usually, it's myself...

1196
01:19:02,275 --> 01:19:04,347
...that I wish I could get away from.

1197
01:19:04,963 --> 01:19:06,785
Seriously, think about this.

1198
01:19:07,266 --> 01:19:09,405
I have never been anywhere...

1199
01:19:09,603 --> 01:19:11,228
...that I haven't been.

1200
01:19:11,747 --> 01:19:13,983
I've never had a kiss...

1201
01:19:14,179 --> 01:19:16,121
...when I wasn't one of the kissers.

1202
01:19:16,323 --> 01:19:18,111
You know, I've never...

1203
01:19:18,307 --> 01:19:21,405
...gone to the movies when<br/>I wasn't there in the audience.

1204
01:19:21,603 --> 01:19:24,091
I've never been out bowling<br/>if I wasn't there...

1205
01:19:24,290 --> 01:19:25,784
...making some stupid joke.

1206
01:19:25,986 --> 01:19:28,768
That's why so many people<br/>hate themselves. Seriously.

1207
01:19:28,962 --> 01:19:31,002
It's just, they are sick to death...

1208
01:19:31,202 --> 01:19:33,374
...of being around themselves.

1209
01:19:34,114 --> 01:19:37,660
Let's say that you and I<br/>were together all the time.

1210
01:19:37,858 --> 01:19:39,997
You'd start to hate<br/>a lot of my mannerisms.

1211
01:19:40,578 --> 01:19:41,855
The way...

1212
01:19:42,050 --> 01:19:45,149
...the way every time<br/>that we would have people over...

1213
01:19:45,730 --> 01:19:48,829
...I'd be insecure, and I'd get<br/>a little too drunk.

1214
01:19:49,603 --> 01:19:53,214
Or the way I tell the same stupid,<br/>pseudo-intellectual story...

1215
01:19:53,410 --> 01:19:55,100
...again and again.

1216
01:19:56,770 --> 01:19:58,842
You see, I've heard<br/>all those stories...

1217
01:19:59,106 --> 01:20:01,626
...so of course I'm sick of myself.

1218
01:20:05,602 --> 01:20:07,031
But being with you...

1219
01:20:09,185 --> 01:20:11,738
...it's made me feel like<br/>I was somebody else.

1220
01:20:13,281 --> 01:20:17,210
I mean, the only other way<br/>to lose yourself like that is...

1221
01:20:18,049 --> 01:20:20,188
...you know, dancing...

1222
01:20:20,545 --> 01:20:22,400
...or alcohol...

1223
01:20:23,009 --> 01:20:25,758
...or drugs, or stuff like that.

1224
01:20:28,193 --> 01:20:29,403
Fucking.

1225
01:20:30,592 --> 01:20:33,626
Fucking, yeah. That's one way.

1226
01:20:47,393 --> 01:20:49,083
Do you know what I want?

1227
01:20:50,241 --> 01:20:51,485
What?

1228
01:20:54,688 --> 01:20:56,215
To be kissed.

1229
01:20:59,392 --> 01:21:00,953
Well, I could do that.

1230
01:21:14,368 --> 01:21:15,383
Wait.

1231
01:21:19,585 --> 01:21:21,373
I have to say something stupid.

1232
01:21:22,944 --> 01:21:23,926
All right.

1233
01:21:25,345 --> 01:21:26,905
It's very stupid.

1234
01:21:29,919 --> 01:21:31,992
I don't think we should<br/>sleep together.

1235
01:21:34,240 --> 01:21:38,518
I want to, but since we're never<br/>going to see each other again...

1236
01:21:38,720 --> 01:21:40,542
...it'll make me feel bad.

1237
01:21:41,408 --> 01:21:44,026
I'll wonder who else you're with.<br/>I'll miss you.

1238
01:21:49,216 --> 01:21:51,582
I know. It's not very adult.

1239
01:21:51,775 --> 01:21:54,525
Maybe it's a female thing.<br/>I can't help it.

1240
01:21:55,040 --> 01:21:56,795
Let's see each other again.

1241
01:21:59,423 --> 01:22:03,253
No, I don't want you to break our vow<br/>just so you can get laid.

1242
01:22:03,775 --> 01:22:07,550
I don't want to just get laid.<br/>I want to... I mean...

1243
01:22:07,999 --> 01:22:10,071
I mean, I think we should.

1244
01:22:11,134 --> 01:22:13,207
We die in the morning, right?

1245
01:22:14,559 --> 01:22:17,374
- I think we should.<br/>- Then it's like some male fantasy.

1246
01:22:17,567 --> 01:22:20,633
Meet a French girl,<br/>fuck her and never see her again.

1247
01:22:20,831 --> 01:22:24,279
And have this great story to tell.<br/>I don't want...

1248
01:22:24,479 --> 01:22:27,097
...this great evening to<br/>just have been for that.

1249
01:22:27,903 --> 01:22:31,285
Okay, we don't have to have sex.<br/>It's not a big deal.

1250
01:22:41,726 --> 01:22:43,614
You don't want to see me again?

1251
01:22:44,990 --> 01:22:46,200
No, of course I do.

1252
01:22:46,398 --> 01:22:48,886
If somebody gave me<br/>the choice right now...

1253
01:22:49,086 --> 01:22:51,869
...of to never see you again<br/>or to marry you...

1254
01:22:52,095 --> 01:22:53,142
...I would marry you.

1255
01:22:53,342 --> 01:22:55,415
Maybe that's a lot<br/>of romantic bullshit...

1256
01:22:55,615 --> 01:22:58,232
...but people have gotten married<br/>for a lot less.

1257
01:23:01,534 --> 01:23:02,330
Actually...

1258
01:23:04,255 --> 01:23:08,794
...I think I decided I wanted to sleep<br/>with you when we got off the train.

1259
01:23:12,286 --> 01:23:15,068
Now that we've talked so much,<br/>I don't know anymore.

1260
01:23:25,470 --> 01:23:27,706
Why do we make everything<br/>so complicated?

1261
01:23:27,902 --> 01:23:29,331
I don't know.

1262
01:24:28,604 --> 01:24:32,182
What's the first thing you'll do<br/>when you get back to Paris?

1263
01:24:32,637 --> 01:24:34,131
Call my parents.

1264
01:24:34,364 --> 01:24:35,673
What about you?

1265
01:24:35,996 --> 01:24:39,957
I don't know. I'll probably go<br/>pick up my dog. He's with a friend.

1266
01:24:40,156 --> 01:24:41,531
You have a dog?<br/>I love dogs.

1267
01:24:41,724 --> 01:24:43,284
- You do?<br/>- Yeah.

1268
01:24:43,612 --> 01:24:45,434
- Oh, shit.<br/>- What?

1269
01:24:46,429 --> 01:24:48,884
I don't know.<br/>We're back in real time.

1270
01:24:49,276 --> 01:24:50,901
I know. I hate that.

1271
01:24:51,228 --> 01:24:52,472
What is that?

1272
01:24:54,460 --> 01:24:56,403
Sounds like a harpsichord.

1273
01:24:56,859 --> 01:24:58,420
Check that out.

1274
01:24:58,780 --> 01:25:00,503
Somebody's playing.

1275
01:25:07,003 --> 01:25:07,985
That's cool.

1276
01:25:25,819 --> 01:25:27,991
Can we dance to the harpsichord?

1277
01:25:28,187 --> 01:25:29,496
Of course.

1278
01:25:33,276 --> 01:25:34,258
Oh, wow.

1279
01:25:38,395 --> 01:25:39,988
I'm gonna take your picture...

1280
01:25:41,211 --> 01:25:43,120
...so I never forget you...

1281
01:25:45,339 --> 01:25:46,550
...or all this.

1282
01:25:47,291 --> 01:25:48,851
Okay, me too.

1283
01:26:44,858 --> 01:26:48,174
"The years shall run like rabbits. "

1284
01:26:50,619 --> 01:26:51,698
What?

1285
01:26:53,690 --> 01:26:54,966
Nothing.

1286
01:26:56,795 --> 01:26:58,484
I have...

1287
01:26:58,969 --> 01:27:01,041
...this recording of Dylan Thomas...

1288
01:27:01,306 --> 01:27:03,215
...reading a W. H. Auden poem.

1289
01:27:03,417 --> 01:27:05,970
He's got a great voice.

1290
01:27:07,834 --> 01:27:08,979
It's like...

1291
01:27:10,266 --> 01:27:12,371
"All the clocks in the city

1292
01:27:12,569 --> 01:27:15,253
Began to whirr and chime:

1293
01:27:15,481 --> 01:27:17,870
'O let not Time deceive you

1294
01:27:18,073 --> 01:27:20,561
You cannot conquer Time.

1295
01:27:20,890 --> 01:27:22,897
In headaches and in worry

1296
01:27:23,224 --> 01:27:26,007
Vaguely life leaks away

1297
01:27:26,200 --> 01:27:28,339
And Time will have his fancy

1298
01:27:28,537 --> 01:27:31,024
Tomorrow or today. '"

1299
01:27:31,577 --> 01:27:33,137
Something like that.

1300
01:27:34,073 --> 01:27:35,218
That's good.

1301
01:27:42,521 --> 01:27:46,230
When you talked earlier<br/>about after a few years...

1302
01:27:46,424 --> 01:27:48,945
...how a couple would begin<br/>to hate each other...

1303
01:27:49,145 --> 01:27:51,032
...by anticipating their reactions...

1304
01:27:51,224 --> 01:27:53,167
...or getting tired<br/>of their mannerisms.

1305
01:27:53,881 --> 01:27:56,150
I think it would be<br/>the opposite for me.

1306
01:27:57,273 --> 01:28:01,430
I think I can really fall in love<br/>when I know everything about someone.

1307
01:28:02,617 --> 01:28:04,210
The way he's gonna part his hair...

1308
01:28:04,409 --> 01:28:06,448
...which shirt he's gonna<br/>wear that day...

1309
01:28:06,648 --> 01:28:10,707
...knowing the exact story he'd tell<br/>in a given situation.

1310
01:28:12,344 --> 01:28:14,765
I'm sure that's when I know<br/>I'm really in love.

1311
01:28:35,544 --> 01:28:37,781
- Hey, guess what.<br/>- What?

1312
01:28:38,136 --> 01:28:40,023
We didn't go to those guys' play.

1313
01:28:40,216 --> 01:28:41,394
Play?

1314
01:28:41,591 --> 01:28:42,868
The cow?

1315
01:28:43,064 --> 01:28:44,722
Oh, yeah, we didn't.

1316
01:28:44,919 --> 01:28:47,058
Oh, no. We missed it.

1317
01:29:11,702 --> 01:29:13,613
You know what bus to take<br/>to the airport?

1318
01:29:13,815 --> 01:29:14,677
No problem.

1319
01:29:14,872 --> 01:29:18,133
- I should get on this one.<br/>- Right here. You wanna get on there?

1320
01:29:21,783 --> 01:29:23,637
I guess this is it, no?

1321
01:29:25,238 --> 01:29:26,667
I really...

1322
01:29:31,830 --> 01:29:34,067
- You know...<br/>- Yeah, I know. Me too.

1323
01:29:40,439 --> 01:29:43,787
Have a great life. Have fun<br/>with everything you're gonna do.

1324
01:29:43,990 --> 01:29:46,259
Good luck with school and all that.

1325
01:29:47,606 --> 01:29:49,069
I hate this.

1326
01:29:49,718 --> 01:29:52,140
Me too.<br/>The train is about to leave.

1327
01:29:59,639 --> 01:30:02,224
You know all this bullshit<br/>we're talking about...

1328
01:30:02,422 --> 01:30:04,877
...not seeing each other?<br/>I don't want that.

1329
01:30:05,078 --> 01:30:06,223
I don't either.

1330
01:30:06,422 --> 01:30:07,916
- You don't?<br/>- I waited for you to say it.

1331
01:30:08,118 --> 01:30:09,613
Why didn't you say something?

1332
01:30:09,813 --> 01:30:11,886
I was afraid<br/>you didn't wanna see me.

1333
01:30:12,086 --> 01:30:13,296
What do you wanna do?

1334
01:30:14,390 --> 01:30:17,237
Maybe we should meet here<br/>in five years or something.

1335
01:30:17,430 --> 01:30:19,536
Five years? That's a long time.

1336
01:30:19,734 --> 01:30:23,029
It's awful. It's like<br/>a sociological experiment.

1337
01:30:23,254 --> 01:30:25,163
- How about one year?<br/>- One year.

1338
01:30:26,038 --> 01:30:28,045
- How about six months?<br/>- Six months?

1339
01:30:28,886 --> 01:30:30,577
It's gonna be freezing.

1340
01:30:30,773 --> 01:30:33,326
Who cares? We come here,<br/>we go somewhere else.

1341
01:30:36,374 --> 01:30:38,228
Six months from now or last night?

1342
01:30:39,637 --> 01:30:43,150
Last night. Six months<br/>from last night, which was...

1343
01:30:43,413 --> 01:30:44,624
...June 16th.

1344
01:30:44,821 --> 01:30:49,164
So track nine, six months from now<br/>at 6:00 at night.

1345
01:30:49,364 --> 01:30:50,258
December.

1346
01:30:50,997 --> 01:30:54,227
It's a train ride for you,<br/>but I gotta fly all the way here.

1347
01:30:54,421 --> 01:30:55,828
But I'm gonna be here.

1348
01:30:56,021 --> 01:30:58,225
- Okay, me too.<br/>- All right.

1349
01:30:59,893 --> 01:31:01,387
We won't call, write or...

1350
01:31:01,590 --> 01:31:02,963
No, it's depressing.

1351
01:31:06,134 --> 01:31:07,824
Your train's gonna leave.

1352
01:31:08,021 --> 01:31:09,581
Say goodbye.

1353
01:31:10,261 --> 01:31:11,057
Bye.

1354
01:31:12,341 --> 01:31:13,486
Goodbye.

1355
01:31:14,580 --> 01:31:15,725
<i>Au revoir. </i>

1356
01:31:17,141 --> 01:31:18,253
Later.

1357
01:31:18,754 --> 01:31:38,754
