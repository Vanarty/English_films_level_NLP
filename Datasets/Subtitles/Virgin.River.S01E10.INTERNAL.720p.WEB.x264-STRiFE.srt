1
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:08,844
So, how long have you known?

2
00:00:09,676 --> 00:00:12,216
I've suspected for a couple of weeks.

3
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:14,513
And you're sure?

4
00:00:15,098 --> 00:00:16,098
Yeah.

5
00:00:16,266 --> 00:00:17,476
I talked to my doctor.

6
00:00:21,312 --> 00:00:24,272
I... I know this isn't
what either of us expected.

7
00:00:25,233 --> 00:00:26,403
Uh, yeah.

8
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:30,317
This is probably the last chance
that I'm gonna have...

9
00:00:31,656 --> 00:00:32,906
to be a mother.

10
00:00:37,245 --> 00:00:39,575
- Okay.
- Like I said in my letter...

11
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:43,044
I wish things were different.

12
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:48,625
Do you... do you think that maybe one day
it... it could be different?

13
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:50,509
What are you asking me?

14
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:55,640
Am I in this alone?

15
00:00:56,931 --> 00:00:59,601
I will support you and this baby.
You know that.

16
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:02,807
Jack, that's not what I'm asking.

17
00:01:08,526 --> 00:01:10,276
I... I need an answer.

18
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:13,909
I'm sorry. I...

19
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:19,158
I just need some...

20
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:21,655
I need a little time to process this,
that's all.

21
00:01:22,373 --> 00:01:23,923
Yeah. That's...

22
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:26,001
that's fair.

23
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:31,423
I gotta... I gotta...

24
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:33,133
go open the salon.

25
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:34,336
Um...

26
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,770
I still love you, Jack.

27
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:17,386
Jack.

28
00:02:18,054 --> 00:02:20,644
I... I'm late getting to Doc,
so I'll just cut to the chase.

29
00:02:20,723 --> 00:02:22,523
- Have you spoken to Charmaine yet?
- Hope,

30
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:26,310
I know it's hard for you
to stay out of everybody's business,

31
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:29,983
but reading that letter crosses a line,
even for you.

32
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:32,606
I was afraid Charmaine
had written something hurtful to you.

33
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:35,284
- And if she had?
- I could've tossed the letter

34
00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:36,873
and spared you some heartache.

35
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:38,528
It wasn't your letter to toss.

36
00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:39,776
Have you told Mel?

37
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:43,039
- I'm on my way there now.
- Good.

38
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:45,621
- Look, I think...
- That I'm handling this.

39
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:47,699
- Okay?
- But if you need me...

40
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:51,210
Yeah. What I need is for you
to stay out of my business.

41
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:53,213
Please.

42
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:02,014
Hey, Jo.

43
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:04,731
Bill wants Dexter.

44
00:03:05,226 --> 00:03:06,346
Wait. The dog?

45
00:03:06,811 --> 00:03:07,811
My dog.

46
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,490
I thought you were in counseling.

47
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:12,567
I think he's dating his assistant.

48
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:13,780
Kimberly?

49
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,990
Kim was, like, two assistants ago.

50
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:17,360
I'm talking about Brooke.

51
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:20,452
Oh. Honey, I'm so sorry.

52
00:03:20,825 --> 00:03:21,825
Oh.

53
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,950
I am not giving up Dexter.

54
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:25,497
You don't have to.

55
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:28,124
I don't wanna
talk about it anymore.

56
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,328
What's goin' on there?

57
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:31,705
Um...

58
00:03:32,837 --> 00:03:34,087
Well, I...

59
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:38,888
I, uh, went out to dinner
with Jack last night.

60
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:40,928
As in a date?

61
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:42,307
Yes...

62
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:46,312
- Well, that's a big step.
- I know.

63
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:51,483
I know. I haven't been, uh, on a date
with anyone other than Mark

64
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:53,574
in, like what, six years?

65
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:56,034
Did you have a good time?

66
00:03:56,694 --> 00:03:59,494
Yeah, I... I did. I had a great time.

67
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:01,655
I'm so glad.

68
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:02,911
I really am.

69
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:04,409
Yeah.

70
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:06,123
I really like him.

71
00:04:06,537 --> 00:04:09,537
He likes you, too.
I could see it when I was there.

72
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,920
Yeah, I mean, he's...
he's the total opposite of Mark, you know.

73
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:17,343
You know what?
This is not about Mark, this is about you.

74
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:21,389
And this is what he would want.
He would want you to...

75
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:24,389
to move on and be happy.

76
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:30,314
Joey, are you crying?

77
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:31,395
No.

78
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:33,692
Oh...

79
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:36,783
Stop crying before I start. Come on.

80
00:04:37,151 --> 00:04:39,651
Jeez. Oh, that's Jack. I gotta...

81
00:04:39,737 --> 00:04:41,157
Hey, come in. I gotta go.

82
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:42,779
Call me later, okay?

83
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:43,865
Okay, bye.

84
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:47,244
Hi.

85
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:49,913
- Hey.
- Okay. So, I have a question to ask you.

86
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:52,207
Uh...

87
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:54,627
Semi-sweet or dark chocolate?

88
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:56,844
Sorry?

89
00:04:56,921 --> 00:04:59,971
- It's for the pancakes.
- Oh. Um...

90
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:04,428
- Oh, do you not like pancakes?
- No, I love pancakes. I... uh...

91
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:08,352
- What?
- I... I just got a call on the way here.

92
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:10,103
My delivery guy's truck broke down,

93
00:05:10,184 --> 00:05:13,024
so I gotta go to Grace Valley
and pick up an order.

94
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:14,104
Ah.

95
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:15,734
Okay. That's too bad.

96
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:18,653
Yeah. Look, I really wanna...

97
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:23,235
I wanna see you. So, maybe tonight,
you know, after I'm done with the bar?

98
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:25,333
Yeah. Okay.

99
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:27,197
I could make dinner.

100
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:28,485
Okay. Yeah.

101
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:30,464
I'd like that.

102
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:31,538
Okay.

103
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:33,745
- All right.
- I'll see you later.

104
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:34,753
- Yeah.
- Okay.

105
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:36,134
- I'll see you then.
- Okay, bye.

106
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:37,210
Yeah.

107
00:05:41,966 --> 00:05:43,546
Yeah.

108
00:05:46,095 --> 00:05:47,215
Well, where have you been?

109
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:51,175
Well, I went to get coffee at Paige's,
and I ran into Connie.

110
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:53,387
And she was a basket case.

111
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:55,398
Her niece Lizzie, the one who lives in LA?

112
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,320
Well, apparently she's turned into
a bit of a wild child.

113
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:00,649
Got herself arrested for shoplifting.

114
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:03,275
Connie says she might have to take her in.

115
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:04,863
Can you imagine?

116
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:07,367
Connie, taking care of a teenager
at her age.

117
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:08,740
- My.
- Then, I talked to Jack,

118
00:06:08,826 --> 00:06:11,536
who's on his way over to Mel's
to tell her about the baby.

119
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,210
What baby?

120
00:06:14,248 --> 00:06:17,168
- If I tell you, you can't tell anyone.
- Lo... Oh...

121
00:06:17,251 --> 00:06:20,001
If it's supposed to be a secret,
let's just keep it that way.

122
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:22,588
Charmaine is pregnant with Jack's baby.

123
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:26,013
That's what that letter business
was all about?

124
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:27,224
- What?
- Uh-huh.

125
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:28,643
I did not see this comin'.

126
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:31,471
From the look on his face,
I'm betting neither did Jack.

127
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:34,477
- What is he gonna do?
- He was on his way over to tell Mel.

128
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,980
Oh, not an easy conversation.

129
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:39,483
Not an easy decision for Jack, either.

130
00:06:40,608 --> 00:06:42,238
Stay out of this.

131
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:45,032
Well, you dragged me over here.
What do you want?

132
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:46,113
Oh! Uh...

133
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:48,315
to invite you to dinner tonight.

134
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:51,488
- Why not just tell me that over the phone?
- Because I'm old-fashioned.

135
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:54,457
I think matters like this
should be attended to in person.

136
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:57,179
Are you trying to sweet-talk your way
out of paying for the divorce

137
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:58,248
by buying me dinner?

138
00:06:58,334 --> 00:07:01,134
Well, keep your free grub,
'cause it's not gonna work.

139
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:04,472
Oh, for Pete's sake, Hope,
you can just stop analyzing it.

140
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:06,129
It's just a meal.

141
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:07,217
Where?

142
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,800
Arthur's.

143
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:10,387
You're paying, right?

144
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:14,478
Okay.
Fair warning, I'm gonna order lobster.

145
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:16,561
- Good.
- And two desserts.

146
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:36,496
- Morning.
- Hey.

147
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,590
I like the new sign.

148
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:43,304
Well, uh... it's just a formality.

149
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:44,879
Oh, right. Okay.

150
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:49,182
Um... You're not supposed
to be drinking coffee

151
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,470
until your next stress test.

152
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:52,013
- It's decaf.
- Oh, really.

153
00:07:52,096 --> 00:07:53,306
I don't trust doctors.

154
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:56,135
Yeah, and I don't trust you.

155
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:58,186
- Oh!
- I'm sorry.

156
00:07:58,936 --> 00:08:00,016
Okay.

157
00:08:00,104 --> 00:08:01,814
Wait a minute.

158
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:03,148
You made coffee?

159
00:08:04,108 --> 00:08:07,198
Well, don't get used to it.
Uh, I gotta take this call.

160
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:16,199
- Oh!
- Wh...

161
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:21,958
The baby doesn't have to change anything.
You guys will figure it out.

162
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:23,173
Baby?

163
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:26,585
Hope, what? I'm sorry,
what baby are you talking about?

164
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:29,514
What's going on?

165
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:31,639
I thought you knew.

166
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:34,103
Hope, what are you talking about?

167
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:36,347
Charmaine's...

168
00:08:37,391 --> 00:08:38,391
pregnant.

169
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:40,018
What?

170
00:08:40,728 --> 00:08:42,358
Jack said he was gonna tell you.

171
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:45,191
And who told you?

172
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:47,992
Charmaine.

173
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:49,236
Hope.

174
00:08:50,738 --> 00:08:51,778
Actually, I...

175
00:08:52,823 --> 00:08:57,123
I read it... in a letter
Charmaine asked me to give to Jack.

176
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:03,668
Hey, Doc.

177
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:05,001
Hey, Sadie.

178
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:08,458
Excuse me. I have a patient.

179
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:13,887
Jack said he was gonna tell her.

180
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,010
I need to talk to him.

181
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:17,056
Did you learn nothing
from what just happened?

182
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:20,689
- This is Jack we're talking about.
- I have to fix this.

183
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:32,533
Okay, here we go. Potato skins.

184
00:09:32,613 --> 00:09:33,613
Chili.

185
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:35,493
Paige. Hey.

186
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:37,986
Thanks for comin'.

187
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:39,657
Sorry, I don't have a lot of time.

188
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:42,575
Jo Ellen is watching Christopher
and minding the truck.

189
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:43,745
All right. Um...

190
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:45,792
Look.

191
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:49,205
Knowing your real name
isn't what's important right now.

192
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:51,756
Then what is?

193
00:09:55,219 --> 00:09:56,759
That you understand
how much...

194
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:58,473
I care about you.

195
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:01,271
Now, I am here.
I'm... I'm not going anywhere.

196
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,900
Okay. All you need to know is that...

197
00:10:06,647 --> 00:10:07,897
I didn't have a choice.

198
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:11,941
My ex-husband has a...

199
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:13,987
temper.

200
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:17,166
At first, it was just me,
but then one night,

201
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:18,529
he went after Christopher.

202
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:23,043
When the police arrived,
I was the one that was arrested.

203
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:24,642
He told the judge that I was unstable.

204
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:27,077
So, he was awarded sole custody
in the divorce.

205
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:31,505
I couldn't leave my son with him.

206
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:36,223
So, I did the only thing I could think of.

207
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:38,970
Run.

208
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:42,385
I am so sorry.

209
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:47,939
I'm scared that if he finds us,
he will kill us both.

210
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:51,650
- He's threatened to enough times.
- I...

211
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:53,936
I won't let that happen.

212
00:10:58,115 --> 00:11:01,075
You're very sweet, Preacher,
but he's a police officer.

213
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:05,003
And he has an entire police force
backing him up.

214
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:09,001
And I've got ten years of tactical
training in the military backing me up.

215
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:15,008
I really just need for you
to do one thing for me.

216
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:18,426
Whatever you need.

217
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:21,352
Don't tell anybody.

218
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:23,223
Not even Jack.

219
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:25,944
I told him.

220
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,850
I... I had to talk to someone.
But, Paige...

221
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:31,225
he won't tell anyone.

222
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:32,607
I swear.

223
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:38,486
Everything's gonna be okay.

224
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:44,869
I need to go.

225
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:52,248
Hey, Paige.

226
00:11:52,336 --> 00:11:53,996
I, uh, need to speak with Jack.

227
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:56,758
Yeah, he, uh... he hasn't come in.

228
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:58,481
- Can I help you with somethin'?
- I wish.

229
00:11:58,551 --> 00:11:59,721
Oh, I don't even wanna know

230
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:01,352
- what you're up to.
- You don't.

231
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:04,182
Uh, I need to run over to Connie's.

232
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:08,015
But, uh, as soon as you see Jack,
would you tell him I need to talk to him?

233
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:09,732
Why don't you just call him on his cell?

234
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:11,692
I need to talk to him face-to-face.

235
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,440
Is everything okay?

236
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:14,864
God, I hope so.

237
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:23,953
Drink lots of fluids,
and get plenty of rest,

238
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:25,584
and call me if your cough gets worse.

239
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:26,751
- I will.
- Okay.

240
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:29,749
And next year, I'm gonna make sure
you come in early for your flu shot.

241
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:31,462
- Thank you, Mel.
- You're welcome.

242
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:42,654
You know, you really should update
these subscriptions.

243
00:12:42,678 --> 00:12:45,008
This California Living is from 2002.

244
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:48,096
Well, magazines these days
are very expensive.

245
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:50,064
Yeah, not enough to make a difference.

246
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:52,154
A penny saved is a penny earned.

247
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:55,573
Oh, my God.
Just... forget I said anything.

248
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:57,938
Oh, boy, somebody's upset.

249
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:00,153
I'm fine.

250
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:02,340
When a woman says "I'm fine,"
there's one thing I know.

251
00:13:02,364 --> 00:13:04,204
She's definitely not fine.

252
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:05,695
I am.

253
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:07,327
Hogwash.

254
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:09,163
In my experience,

255
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:13,459
bottling up your feelings
never does anyone any good.

256
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:18,763
Jack should have told me.

257
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:22,050
Yeah.

258
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:27,973
Is that really what's bothering you?

259
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:32,808
The message is more important
than who did or didn't give it to you.

260
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:37,442
Charmaine being pregnant
just changes everything.

261
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:41,816
Now, the heart of the matter.

262
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:46,116
I mean, I don't even know
what I'm doing. I...

263
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:49,618
I didn't come here for this.

264
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:51,246
You know?

265
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,710
For what, exactly?

266
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:54,290
To start anything.

267
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:59,256
Whenever you go somewhere new,
it's always the start of somethin'.

268
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,260
You know...

269
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:07,932
what this month taught me?

270
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:09,852
I have no idea.

271
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:12,231
Get your feelings out in the open.

272
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:14,978
You know...

273
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:18,317
maybe if I had done that with Hope...

274
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:21,399
Well, unlike you and Hope,

275
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:23,743
Jack and I don't have
a long history together.

276
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,030
But...

277
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:28,327
maybe you have a future.

278
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:53,773
Hey, there.

279
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:54,941
- Hey.
- What can I get you?

280
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:57,859
- Uh... Whatever's on tap.
- Comin' right up.

281
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:02,320
So, are you stayin' in town
or just passin' through?

282
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:04,568
I'm kind of playin' it by ear.

283
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,030
Okay.

284
00:15:07,364 --> 00:15:08,364
Thank you.

285
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:13,539
That pie looks delicious.

286
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,209
You want a slice?

287
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:16,539
I do.

288
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:20,919
Is that apple?

289
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,420
With pears.

290
00:15:22,796 --> 00:15:24,876
My mother used to make pie that way.

291
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:26,627
My wife, too.

292
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:30,103
Paige is a pretty good baker.

293
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:32,139
Paige, huh? She a... she a local?

294
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,310
Uh, yeah, just down the way.

295
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:35,891
- She's got a bakery...
- Hey, Ricky.

296
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:38,596
- Yeah.
- Table ten could use some more water.

297
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:39,687
- Okay.
- Yeah.

298
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:43,315
So, I don't think I caught your name.

299
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,400
Preacher.

300
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:46,525
Uh... Paul.

301
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:48,782
You got a last name there, Paul?

302
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:50,664
Um... You know...

303
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:54,203
I think I'm just gonna settle up,
and, uh...

304
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:57,830
keep the change.

305
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:09,548
- Ricky...
- Hm?

306
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:12,135
Be right back.

307
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:45,835
- Hey.
- Hey.

308
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:48,131
Can you get Brady to give me a hand
with this order?

309
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:49,335
Uh, he's not here.

310
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:51,797
It's after one.

311
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:53,891
Yeah, it is.

312
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:56,264
You okay?

313
00:16:57,224 --> 00:16:58,224
Yeah.

314
00:16:58,392 --> 00:17:00,102
Yeah. I just got a lot on my mind.

315
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:02,767
Oh, and Hope's lookin' for you.

316
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:04,225
Is somethin' up with her?

317
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:06,984
Just Hope being Hope.

318
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:18,252
- Brady.
- What's up?

319
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:20,118
- You're late, that's what's up.
- All right.

320
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:24,417
Come here.

321
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:30,629
You were supposed to be here
three hours ago.

322
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:34,796
- Yeah, I had some stuff I needed to do.
- Are we inconveniencing you with this job?

323
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:38,812
This is my business, you understand?

324
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:42,018
Yes, sir.

325
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:45,058
You're the boss, Jack. Whatever you say.

326
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:46,147
Hold on.

327
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:47,780
- What'd... what'd you say?
- All right.

328
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:49,858
- I said Jack's the boss.
- I don't like your tone.

329
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:51,588
- No one's talking to you.
- I'm so sick of...

330
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:53,132
- Touch me again, I'll...
- Stop! Stop!

331
00:17:57,993 --> 00:17:59,083
Walk away.

332
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:05,666
- I'm done.
- Hey, listen to me.

333
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:08,171
You walk away from here right now,
you never come back here.

334
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:09,593
You understand me?

335
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:19,894
So long, Jack.

336
00:18:28,857 --> 00:18:29,897
Hm.

337
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:33,494
Now you listen to me.

338
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,370
He is not your problem.

339
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:40,198
And you trying to save him
doesn't change the past.

340
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:44,751
What happened in Mosul,
it wasn't your fault.

341
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:48,750
What happened to Lonergan
wasn't your fault.

342
00:18:54,758 --> 00:18:55,838
Lonergan!

343
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:02,184
Brady!

344
00:19:05,602 --> 00:19:07,272
Just hang in there. Okay?

345
00:19:07,896 --> 00:19:08,936
You're gonna be all right.

346
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:10,461
You're gonna be all right.

347
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:13,896
Please don't leave me.

348
00:19:15,737 --> 00:19:17,197
Ain't gonna happen. Hear me?

349
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:19,866
Promise.

350
00:19:20,617 --> 00:19:22,827
Hey, I don't leave men behind.

351
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:25,496
Okay?

352
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:30,751
Lonergan.

353
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:31,956
Lonergan.

354
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:33,212
Jack.

355
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:34,592
Hey.

356
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:36,263
You do yourself a favor,

357
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:39,967
and you let Brady stay gone this time.

358
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:44,223
I can't. I...

359
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:03,865
Is there somethin' else goin' on, Jack?

360
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:07,616
Ah, come on, man.

361
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:11,539
Charmaine's pregnant.

362
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:13,794
Oh.

363
00:20:15,672 --> 00:20:16,722
Mm. Yeah.

364
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:30,478
So, what are you gonna do?

365
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:33,654
I haven't figured that out yet.

366
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:36,652
- So, have you told Mel?
- No.

367
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,815
I just need a day.

368
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:43,033
I don't wanna screw things up with her.

369
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:44,405
Yeah, I get it.

370
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:48,457
So, what does Charmaine say?

371
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:54,539
- She says she's still in love with me.
- Yeah. And you don't feel the same way.

372
00:20:54,878 --> 00:20:56,918
Well, if I did...

373
00:20:59,174 --> 00:21:00,764
things would be a lot simpler.

374
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:04,052
Whatever you decide,

375
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:07,678
I'm there for you.

376
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:09,888
Thank you.

377
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:15,108
I just need to clear my head.

378
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:18,783
You go. I will, uh... I'll watch the bar.

379
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:26,794
Finally.

380
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,199
There you are.

381
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:31,371
All right, not now, Hope, please.

382
00:21:31,748 --> 00:21:35,248
- I made a horrible mistake.
- Yeah, we've already been over this.

383
00:21:35,335 --> 00:21:38,165
No, this is something else,
and you're not gonna like it.

384
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,340
I...

385
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:44,925
accidentally told Mel
about Charmaine being pregnant.

386
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:50,096
You what?

387
00:21:50,183 --> 00:21:52,733
You said you were going to tell her,
so I thought she knew.

388
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:56,901
I... I told you to stay out of my business.

389
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:58,126
- I made...
- In my defense...

390
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,860
There is no defense, Hope.

391
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:03,572
- I said stay out of my business.
- I wanted to help you.

392
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:06,275
You're not helping me!
How does this help me?

393
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:10,580
God, clearly the only... the only way

394
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:13,292
that I'm gonna get you
to stop meddling in my life

395
00:22:13,373 --> 00:22:14,713
is to keep you out of it.

396
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:16,251
- So...
- You don't mean that.

397
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:17,335
...keep out of it.

398
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,920
Jack. I'm sorry.

399
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:35,519
Jack.

400
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:37,685
I need to talk to you.

401
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:43,857
Uh...

402
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:02,010
I'm sorry.
I should have told you this morning.

403
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:03,507
Yes. You should have.

404
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:08,391
Oh, God. I knew this was a mistake.

405
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:10,850
- What? No, Mel, don't...
- No, all of this. All of this.

406
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:13,771
You, moving out here
to the middle of nowhere,

407
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:16,400
thinking that I could just have
just an ounce of happiness.

408
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:19,648
- Hey, look, I'm gonna figure this out.
- There's nothing to figure out.

409
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:23,489
You're... you're having a baby
with another woman.

410
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:25,778
That doesn't change how I feel about you.

411
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:29,994
It's not too late, okay?
We just started whatever this is.

412
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:31,075
- We can...
- No.

413
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:32,788
We can just be friends. It'll...

414
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:34,832
I can't do that.

415
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:37,002
Well, it's not up to you.

416
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,500
Mel.

417
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:41,127
No.

418
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:06,532
Okay.

419
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:13,662
- You're early.
- I am.

420
00:24:14,744 --> 00:24:17,254
And flannel clashes with lobster.

421
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:18,790
I d... I don't wanna eat.

422
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:22,342
Oh, you're passin' up free lobster?

423
00:24:23,086 --> 00:24:24,666
I've ruined everything.

424
00:24:26,673 --> 00:24:29,263
Well, maybe not everything.

425
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:34,638
I'm sorry.

426
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:36,891
For what?

427
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:42,016
For refusing to accept your apology
for the past 20 years.

428
00:24:43,273 --> 00:24:46,493
You tried over and over,
and... and I wouldn't have it,

429
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:47,738
and now I...

430
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:51,951
finally understand
how bad I must have made you feel.

431
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:55,699
Thank you...

432
00:24:57,496 --> 00:24:58,366
but it's okay.

433
00:24:58,455 --> 00:25:00,665
You know,
I'm a pretty tough hide.

434
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:02,543
It's not okay.

435
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:06,213
Nothing I've done is okay.

436
00:25:08,465 --> 00:25:10,295
I've made a me... a mess.

437
00:25:10,967 --> 00:25:14,927
Yeah, Mel and Jack, they're gonna...
they'll work through this.

438
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:17,973
I don't think they will,
and it's all my fault.

439
00:25:18,975 --> 00:25:21,595
What if he never speaks to me again?

440
00:25:22,979 --> 00:25:24,399
What if Mel leaves?

441
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:25,571
Oh, come on.

442
00:25:27,567 --> 00:25:28,567
Look.

443
00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:30,569
You messed up.

444
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:33,624
I feel awful.

445
00:25:34,282 --> 00:25:36,332
Maybe this time you'll let it sink in.

446
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:41,619
You... you just can't butt into
other people's business.

447
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,500
- I was trying to help.
- I know.

448
00:25:45,001 --> 00:25:47,591
The truth is
you didn't create this situation.

449
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:51,683
This was all between Mel, and Jack,
and Charmaine.

450
00:25:52,842 --> 00:25:54,592
But now, what you need to do

451
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:56,598
is something
that doesn't come naturally to you.

452
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:58,220
Stay out of it.

453
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:01,016
Let them find their way through it.

454
00:26:02,644 --> 00:26:04,484
I know how much Jack means to you.

455
00:26:07,357 --> 00:26:08,567
Uh, he'll come around.

456
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:13,069
I think maybe this time I've gone too far,

457
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:16,032
and there might not be
any room to come back.

458
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:19,742
You just had a bad, bad day.

459
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:23,538
I push people away, Vernon.

460
00:26:24,791 --> 00:26:27,001
It's what I do. What I've always done.

461
00:26:28,878 --> 00:26:32,758
I pushed Connie away, and...
and the other ladies. And you.

462
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:36,850
Now I've done it to Jack and Mel.

463
00:26:40,974 --> 00:26:42,234
I have somethin' for you.

464
00:26:49,316 --> 00:26:50,316
What's this?

465
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:53,646
This is somethin' you've wanted
for a long time.

466
00:27:04,497 --> 00:27:05,747
Divorce papers.

467
00:27:05,832 --> 00:27:09,542
Newly drawn, executed, and fully paid.

468
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:12,089
All it needs is your signature.

469
00:27:12,672 --> 00:27:13,672
We file it.

470
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:15,049
It's final.

471
00:27:15,258 --> 00:27:16,258
Boom.

472
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:18,390
We are divorced.

473
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:23,983
Divorced or married...

474
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,940
you can push as hard as you want,
Hope McCrea.

475
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:30,896
I'm not goin' anywhere.

476
00:27:37,864 --> 00:27:41,084
You haven't been this quiet
for this long ever.

477
00:27:41,368 --> 00:27:44,538
I mean, wh... you having
another heart attack?

478
00:27:44,621 --> 00:27:46,461
Come on, speak to me, Hope.

479
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:51,335
Hope.

480
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:54,417
Well, those don't look like tears of joy.

481
00:28:07,435 --> 00:28:09,895
Hey, Preacher, my grandma called.
Do you need me to stay?

482
00:28:09,979 --> 00:28:12,729
No, you know what?
You, uh... you get going.

483
00:28:12,982 --> 00:28:15,362
I made some trout and vegetables
for you two for dinner.

484
00:28:15,443 --> 00:28:16,533
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

485
00:28:21,574 --> 00:28:23,284
Hey, leave a message...

486
00:28:23,993 --> 00:28:25,873
Hey, Paige, it's me, uh, just, uh...

487
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:28,424
just checkin' in,
makin' sure everything is all right.

488
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:32,377
Listen, I was, um... I was thinkin'
about swingin' by when things slow down,

489
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:35,880
so just... just give me a call, okay?

490
00:28:38,633 --> 00:28:40,553
Uh, thanks for dinner.

491
00:28:40,635 --> 00:28:42,045
Right. Uh...

492
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:44,230
- Tell your grandma I say hello.
- All right.

493
00:28:44,305 --> 00:28:45,555
- See you later.
- Yeah.

494
00:28:52,772 --> 00:28:54,112
Sheriff, any word?

495
00:28:54,482 --> 00:28:56,322
The plate's registered
to a Joshua Benson...

496
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:58,191
- Joshua Benson?
- You heard of him?

497
00:28:58,653 --> 00:29:00,243
No, no, I never heard of him.

498
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:03,030
You sure that's who
the vehicle's registered to?

499
00:29:03,116 --> 00:29:05,116
That's what's comin' up on the report.

500
00:29:05,326 --> 00:29:06,326
Okay.

501
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:07,703
Okay, thanks.

502
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:20,512
Hey. Um...

503
00:29:21,968 --> 00:29:26,218
Can I get a large... uh, decaf latte
with extra foam, please?

504
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:29,475
Mel.

505
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:31,435
Hi.

506
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,020
Hi.

507
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:35,650
What are you doing in Clear River?

508
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:37,775
Um...

509
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:42,112
I was just on my way back
from seeing Lilly and Chloe.

510
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:43,197
Hm.

511
00:29:45,074 --> 00:29:48,374
Um... Do... do you work around here, or...

512
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:50,833
I do. I... I just work over on Main Street.

513
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:52,294
Oh. Nice.

514
00:29:52,373 --> 00:29:53,753
- Do you like it?
- Yeah.

515
00:29:53,833 --> 00:29:57,463
Yeah, the... the girls are really nice,
and I make a decent living.

516
00:29:58,379 --> 00:29:59,759
That's good. Oh, thank you.

517
00:30:01,382 --> 00:30:04,092
Yeah, well, um... it was nice to see you.

518
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:06,303
Yeah.

519
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:09,564
Congratulations on your baby.

520
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:14,310
I... I just wanted you to know I, um...

521
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:16,108
I... I didn't plan this.

522
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:19,399
Oh, I... I didn't think you did.

523
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:23,324
Actually, I didn't even think
that I could get pregnant.

524
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:27,775
While this isn't necessarily
how I wanted things to go,

525
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:31,790
I'm... I'm really...
I'm grateful.

526
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:35,124
I'm gonna be a mom.

527
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:38,285
That's something I never thought I'd say.

528
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:45,335
I am sure that you and Jack
are going to be wonderful parents.

529
00:30:46,427 --> 00:30:47,347
Hm.

530
00:30:47,428 --> 00:30:50,268
Yeah, it... it's a bit more complicated
than that.

531
00:30:51,391 --> 00:30:53,941
I've seen the way that he looks at you.

532
00:30:54,811 --> 00:30:55,851
And, uh...

533
00:30:57,188 --> 00:31:00,648
yeah, he... he hasn't ever
looked at me like that...

534
00:31:01,192 --> 00:31:02,242
in two years.

535
00:31:05,905 --> 00:31:07,115
It's not about me.

536
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:15,785
I don't want Jack to come back to me
because of his damn sense of honor.

537
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:20,705
It... it has to be a choice, his choice.

538
00:31:25,341 --> 00:31:26,591
And to be honest,

539
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:29,678
that's never gonna happen
as long as you're here.

540
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:33,347
Well, I...

541
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:02,336
Hello again.

542
00:32:05,506 --> 00:32:07,756
Jimmy tells me you're done
workin' that bar job.

543
00:32:07,842 --> 00:32:08,972
Yeah, might be.

544
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:12,845
What about Jack?
I thought you two were tight.

545
00:32:13,806 --> 00:32:15,096
I got a lot of friends.

546
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:17,439
What I don't have is money.

547
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:21,516
From the looks of it,
you don't got that problem.

548
00:32:32,825 --> 00:32:35,325
I got a lot of ex-military guys
workin' for me.

549
00:32:35,411 --> 00:32:37,081
- Yeah?
- I was in the army.

550
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:41,213
Now you're what?

551
00:32:44,587 --> 00:32:45,587
Into weed?

552
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:52,600
The syndicate I work for has the support
of virtually every town around here,

553
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:55,429
including a lot
of the local law enforcement.

554
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:56,425
Okay.

555
00:32:56,516 --> 00:32:59,726
Now, I can count on Clear River
and Garverville for materials,

556
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:01,441
security, distribution.

557
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:03,898
The only holdout in the whole county...

558
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,780
Virgin River.

559
00:33:06,859 --> 00:33:08,989
I think you might be able
to help me with that.

Why don't we just pull over

564
00:33:39,308 --> 00:33:40,308
It's okay.

565
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:42,019
I got it.

566
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:49,070
I do... think
I took a wrong turn somewhere.

567
00:33:49,152 --> 00:33:50,532
Why don't we just go home?

568
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:53,122
It took me two weeks
to get this reservation.

569
00:33:53,156 --> 00:33:54,316
- Fine.
- I'm...

570
00:33:55,116 --> 00:33:58,696
- I just don't care about Bestia right now.
- Sweetheart, can we not do this?

571
00:33:58,786 --> 00:34:00,866
- For one night, with the...
- Listen, I know, okay?

572
00:34:00,955 --> 00:34:02,245
You don't want a surrogate.

573
00:34:02,331 --> 00:34:06,591
That's fine. But can we at least just
do one... one more round of IVF?

574
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:10,049
Mark, when we lost our baby,

575
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:12,051
you promised me
we could have another child.

576
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:13,513
Because I thought we could.

577
00:34:13,926 --> 00:34:15,636
- Baby...
- We can.

578
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:18,890
I see this all the time
with my patients, okay?

579
00:34:18,973 --> 00:34:21,603

there is a chance.

Sweetheart, you and I...

581
00:34:25,938 --> 00:34:29,188
Our marriage is the thing
that matters here, okay?

582
00:34:30,943 --> 00:34:31,993
We are what matters.

583
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:35,280
And if we don't stop this,
we're gonna lose us.

584
00:34:35,656 --> 00:34:37,776
I don't wanna stop trying.

585
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:40,575

We don't want the same things anymore,

00:35:03,142 --> 00:35:05,562
I just don't think love is enough anymore.

00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:56,032
Come in. It's open.

610
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:12,590
I am confused.

611
00:36:12,962 --> 00:36:16,592
I thought the divorce was what you wanted.

612
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:19,258
I think I just got scared.

613
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,760
Of what?

614
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:22,137
Dying.

615
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:26,270
The heart attack
really did a number on me.

616
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:28,685
It made me feel weak.

617
00:36:29,645 --> 00:36:30,645
You ain't that.

618
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:38,525
So, you wanted to exert some control
over your life. That's understandable.

619
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:43,124
I never told you this, but...

620
00:36:44,952 --> 00:36:46,292
when Charmaine's mother...

621
00:36:48,581 --> 00:36:50,711
Rachel, when she got sick,

622
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:54,585
she asked me to visit her in the hospital.

623
00:36:57,924 --> 00:36:59,014
I refused to go.

624
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:03,427
We were friends for 30 years, and...

625
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:08,100
I never gave her a chance
to make amends.

626
00:37:09,685 --> 00:37:12,555
Oh, God.
I regret that choice, and I always will.

627
00:37:15,942 --> 00:37:17,362
You know...

628
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:23,450
I regret having broken our wedding vows...

629
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:26,330
every day that I'm alive.

630
00:37:29,622 --> 00:37:30,752
I know you do.

631
00:37:33,542 --> 00:37:34,542
Well...

632
00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:37,456
whether you realize it or not...

633
00:37:39,382 --> 00:37:43,842
ah, there is pretty much nothing
I wouldn't do to make you happy.

634
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:50,229
You, my dear...

635
00:37:53,187 --> 00:37:54,307
are an original.

636
00:37:56,983 --> 00:37:58,443
And God's honest truth...

637
00:38:00,403 --> 00:38:02,613
I've never stopped loving you.

638
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:05,073
You've gotta know that.

639
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:09,330
- Oh, Vernon.
- Yeah.

640
00:38:09,412 --> 00:38:10,622
There's something else.

641
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:12,789
What?

642
00:38:16,252 --> 00:38:17,462
I love you, too.

643
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:01,421
Paige?

644
00:39:02,965 --> 00:39:03,965
It's Preacher.

645
00:39:06,635 --> 00:39:08,005
Hey, guys, it's Preacher.

646
00:39:19,315 --> 00:39:20,315
Paige?

647
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:05,612
You shouldn't be here.

648
00:40:13,202 --> 00:40:17,252
Look, it's been a long day,
and I'm tired.

649
00:40:20,334 --> 00:40:21,844
I just wanna say I'm sorry.

650
00:40:21,919 --> 00:40:26,469
Do you know how embarrassing it was
to have to hear that from Hope?

651
00:40:26,924 --> 00:40:29,484
I can imagine. That's why
I didn't want you to find out that way.

652
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:31,029
I wanted to talk to you tonight and...

653
00:40:31,053 --> 00:40:33,393
It made me feel like I couldn't trust you.

654
00:40:36,642 --> 00:40:37,642
I know.

655
00:40:39,228 --> 00:40:40,228
And you can.

656
00:40:44,358 --> 00:40:45,478
Jack, this isn't...

657
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:48,454
this isn't just...

658
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:52,533
you not telling me
about Charmaine and the baby, okay?

659
00:40:58,914 --> 00:41:00,124
A few years ago...

660
00:41:02,042 --> 00:41:03,842
I had a stillborn baby.

661
00:41:05,671 --> 00:41:07,511
And now I can't have children.

662
00:41:10,509 --> 00:41:11,549
I'm...

663
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:14,429
sorry.

664
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:19,386
And her having a baby
is something that I can't ever have.

665
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:22,270
And...

666
00:41:23,439 --> 00:41:26,229
it's just...
it's just too much for me to handle, okay?

667
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:27,857
It's just asking too much of me.

668
00:41:27,943 --> 00:41:30,493
I am just as scared as you are, okay?

669
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:33,451
I have never felt this
for anybody in my life.

670
00:41:33,532 --> 00:41:36,042
I didn't even know I could.
And then you walk in...

671
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:40,748
and from that first moment
that I saw you, I knew.

672
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:42,582
Stop, please, Jack.

673
00:41:42,917 --> 00:41:45,127
I can't stop how I feel, okay?

674
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:50,376
I... I'm falling in love with you.

675
00:41:50,466 --> 00:41:51,926
Don't say that.

676
00:41:53,427 --> 00:41:56,847
I know... what I'm asking is a lot.

677
00:41:58,307 --> 00:42:00,887
Okay, but I... I can't ch...
I can't change your past.

678
00:42:02,436 --> 00:42:04,396
But I wanna be a part of your future.

679
