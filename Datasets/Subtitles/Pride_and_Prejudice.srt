beautiful creature i have ever beheld

agreeable fairly tolerable

00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,000

00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,959
dance with him for all of derbyshire

120
00:09:54,959 --> 00:10:05,839

00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:29,839
oh

130
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,640
your friend miss lucas is the most

131
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,839
amazing young woman oh yes i adore her

132
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:42,240
it is a british is not more handsome

133
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,320
but lizzy will never admit that she's

134
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,920
plain

135
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:49,279
of course it's my jane who is considered

136
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:51,040
the beauty of my heart

137
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,200
she was only 15 there was a gentleman so

138
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,120
much in love with her but i was

139
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,240
sure he would make her an offer however

140
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,880
he did write her some very pretty verses

141
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,079
and that put paid to it

142
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:03,279
i wonder if he first discovered the

143
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:05,760
power of poetry and driving away laughs

144
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,120
i thought the poetry was the food of

145
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,360
love of a fine doubt love it may

146
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,040
but if it is only a vague inclination

147
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,639
i'm convinced one poor sonnet will kill

148
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:14,480
its stone dead so what do you recommend

149
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:19,279
to encourage affection dancing

150
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:22,839
even if one's partner is barely

151
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:25,839
tolerable

00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:47,279
mr bingley is just what a young man

155
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:49,519
ought to be

156
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:52,959
sensible could you hand some

157
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,000
which is why i will end up an old maid

158
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,079
do you really believe you like music

159
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,160

00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,800
it

162
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,160

163
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,839
like many as cheap at a person now

164
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:11,519
you're a great deal to act to like

00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:13,279
people in general you know

166
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:14,800
all the world is good and agreeable in

00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,880
your eyes not his friend

168
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,160

169
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,519
about you mr darcy

170
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:23,440
i'd more easily forgive his vanity had

171
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,399
he not wounded mine

172
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,760
but no matter i doubt we should never

173
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:35,839
speak again

lucas we were all there now

179
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:06,720

standing and the fifth

184
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,240
again with jane he had any compassion

185
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,600
for me he would have sprained his ankle

186
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,160
in the first

187
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,079

00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:25,199
when you die mr bennett which may in

191
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:27,279

192
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:29,199
without a roof over their head nor a

193
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:31,120
penny to their life hey mama please it's

194
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,399
ten in the morning

00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:34,399
a letter addressed to miss bennett mom

196
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:37,519
from netherfield wall

197

198
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,760
oh happy day

199
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:51,600
it is from caroline bingley she has

200
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,880
invited me to dine with her

201
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,560
her brother will be dining out dining

202
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,199
out

203
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:01,199
can i take the carriage where let me see

204
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:03,199
that it's too far to walk my mom

205
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:05,760
accountable of him dining out into my

206
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,639
carriage for jane

207
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:14,639
certainly not go on horseback

208
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:27,839
horseback

209
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:35,680
oh she'll have to stay the night exactly

210
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,199
as i predicted

211
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,759
good grief woman your skills in the art

212
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:42,399
matchmaker positively occult

213
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:43,759
though i don't think mama you can

214
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:45,360
reasonably take credit for making it

215
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,680
rain

216
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,279
my kind friends will not hear of me

217
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:54,959
returning home until i am better but do

218
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:56,880
not be alarmed accepting a sore throat a

219
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,399
fever and a headache there is nothing

220
00:15:58,399 --> 00:15:59,839
much wrong with me

221
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:02,480
this is ridiculous well if jane does die

222
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,920
it'd be a comfort to know it was in

223
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,199
pursuit of mr bingham

224
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:08,880
people do not die of cold

225
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,240
with the shame of having such a mother

226
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:23,839
i must get another one

227
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:28,320
[Music]

228
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,920
apparently lady barthurst is

229
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,839
redecorating her ballroom in the french

230
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:33,360
style

231
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,839
a little unpatriotic don't you think

232
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:51,839
miss elizabeth bent

233
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:57,680

here

235
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:05,839
i did

236
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,039
i'm so sorry how is my sister she's

237
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:11,520
upstairs

00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:28,319
my goodness did you see her hem six

240
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,320
inches deep in mud

241
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,760
she looked positively medieval i feel

242
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,760
such a terrible imposition they're being

243
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,360
so kind to me

244
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,880
don't worry i don't know who is more

245
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,960
pleased at your being here mama or mr

246
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,840
bingley

247
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:50,000
thank you for turning to my sister so

248
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,919
diligently she is in far better comfort

249
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:53,200
here than she would have been at home

250
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,559
it's a pleasure no i mean it's

251
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:58,160
sorry not a pleasure that she's ill of

252
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,080
course not it's a pleasure that she's

253
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,360
here

254
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,840
being ill

255
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,120
not going to be famous our pigs tackled

256
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:09,600
back

257
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,640
not related to the rounded pig of norris

258
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:16,480
now that bigger it's all going according

259
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,280
to plan

260
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,440
he's half in love with her already who

261
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,360
is blasting mr bingley

262
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,559
and he doesn't mind a bit that she

263
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,320
hasn't a penny so he has more than

264
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,080
enough for the two of them

265
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,960
oh we need them

266
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:49,009
[Applause]

267
00:18:57,330 --> 00:19:06,660
[Applause]

268
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:14,539
[Applause]

269
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,760
you write uncommonly fast mr darcy

270
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,919
you're mistaken i write rather slowly

271
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:23,600
how many letters you must have occasion

272
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,080
to write

273
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:27,360
mr darcy letters of business too how

274
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,039
odious i should think them it is

275
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:30,720
fortunate then that they fall to my lot

276
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,760
instead of yours

277
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,760
do tell your sister that i longed to see

278
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,760
her i've already told her once by your

279
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,640
desire i do dote on her i was quite in

280
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,720
raptures at her beautiful little design

281
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,440
for a table

282
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,200
perhaps you will give me leave to defer

283
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,880
your raptures till i write again

284
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,320
present i have no room enough to do them

285
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,000
justice well i think it's amazing you

286
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,520
young ladies have the patience to be so

287
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,840
accomplished what do you mean charles

288
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,240
you all paint tables and play the piano

289
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:54,480
and

290
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,039
embroider cushions i never heard of a

291
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:58,320
young lady but people say she is

292
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,039
accomplished

293
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:00,960
the word is indeed applied too liberally

294
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,400
i cannot boast of knowing more than

295
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,520
half a dozen women in all my

296
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,840
acquaintances that are truly

297
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:05,600
accomplished nor

298
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,280
are i to be sure goodness you must

299
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,919
comprehend a great deal than the idea

300
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:13,039
i do absolutely she must have a thorough

301
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:14,080
knowledge of music

302
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,000
singing drawing dancing and the modern

303
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,120
languages to deserve the word

304
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,760
and something in her air and manner of

305
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,120
walking

306
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,320
and of course she must improve her mind

307
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,159
by extensive reading

308
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:27,360
i'm no longer surprised that you're

309
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,360
knowing only six accomplished women i

310
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,520
rather wander out you're knowing any

311
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,840
are you so severe on your own sex i

312
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,000
never saw such a woman

313
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,440
she would certainly be a fearsome thing

314
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,220
to behold

315
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:40,799
[Laughter]

316
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:42,720
mr elizabeth let us take a turn about

317
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:49,840
the room

318
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,840
it's refreshing is it not after sitting

319
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,159
so long in one attitude

320
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:08,000
it is a small kind of accomplishment i

321
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,520
suppose

322
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:12,400
will you not join us mr darcy you can

323
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,280
only have two

324
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,960
motives caroline and i would interfere

325
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,120
with either what can he mean

326
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,960
my first way of disappointing him will

327
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,880
be to ask him nothing about it

328
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,720
but do tell us mr darcy

329
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,600
either you are in each other's

330
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,679
confidence and you have

331
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:32,000
secret affairs to discuss or you are

332
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,919
conscious that your figures

333
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:35,440
appear to the greatest advantage by

334
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,840
walking

335
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:41,120
if the first i should get in your way if

336
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,159
the second

337
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:44,240
i can admire you much better from here

338
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,240
shocking how shall we punish him for

339
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,039
such a speech

340
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:49,360
you could always laugh at him oh no mr

341
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,200
darcy is not to be teased

342
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,000
are you too proud mr darcy and would you

343
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,919
consider pride a fault or a virtue that

344
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:57,039
i couldn't say

345
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:58,320
because we're doing our best to find

346
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,000
fault in you maybe it's that i find it

347
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,600
hard to forgive the follies and vices of

348
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,159
others

349
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:04,559
or their offences against me my good

350
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:08,240
opinion once lost is lost forever

351
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:13,200
dear i cannot tease you about that

352
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,000
what a shame for ideally love to laugh a

353
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:27,840
family trait i think

354
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,559
a mrs bennett a miss bennett a miss

355
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:50,080
bennett and

356
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,240
miss bennett sir oh for heaven's sake

357
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,919
are we to receive every bennett in the

358
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:56,400
country

359
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:01,039
what an excellent room you have sir

360
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:04,720
such expensive furnishings

361
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,280
oh i do hope you intend to stay here mr

362
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,120
bingley absolutely i

363
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,360
find the country very diverting don't

364
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,960
you agree darcy

365
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,440
i find it perfectly adequate even if

366
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,200
society is a little less varied than in

367
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,080
town

368
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,880
less varied not at all we dine with four

369
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,000
and twenty families

370
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,440
of all shapes and sizes so william lucas

371
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,240
for instance

372
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,760
is a very agreeable man and a good deal

373
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:30,159
less

374
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:32,480
self-important than some people half his

375
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,840
rank

376
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,280
mr bingley is it true that you have

377
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,640
promised to hold a ball here at another

378
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,000
field a ball

379
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,679
um it would be an excellent way to meet

380
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:42,320
new friends you could invite the militia

381
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,000
they're excellent oh do you hold the

382
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,559
ball kitty

383
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:48,000
when your sister is recovered you shall

384
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,320
name the day i think a ball is a

385
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,159
perfectly irrational way to gain new

386
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:53,279
acquaintance

387
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:55,120
it would be better if conversation

388
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,880
instead of dancing with the order of the

389
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:57,679
day

390
00:23:57,679 --> 00:23:59,600
indeed much more rational but rather

391
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,919
less like a ball

392
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:05,440
thank you mary what a fine

393
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,360
imposing place it is to be sure is it

394
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,039
not my dears

395
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:10,799
there's no house to equal it in the

396
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:12,559
county

397
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:15,919
mr darcy miss bennett there she is

398
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:17,600
mr bingley i don't know how to thank you

399
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,039
you're welcome anytime you feel the

400
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:20,640
least bit poorly

401
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,320
thank you for your stimulating company

402
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,840
it has been most instructor

403
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:28,080
not at all pleasure is all mine

404
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:33,039
mr darcy mr

405
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,039
my idea you've ordered a good dinner

406
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:02,480
today

407
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,559
i have reason to expect an addition to

408
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:06,640
our family party

409
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,400
his name is mr collins he's the dreaded

410
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,240
cousin who's to inherit

411
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,720
indeed everything apparently even my

412
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,200
piano store belongs to mr collins

413
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,039
when he may turn us out of the house as

414
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:19,520
soon as he peases but why

415
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,960
because the estate passes directly to

416
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:28,320
him and not to us for the females

417
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,760
mr collins at your service

418
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,080
what a superbly featured room and what

419
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,960
excellent boiled potatoes

420
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,320
many years since i've had such an

421
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:49,200
exemplary vegetable

422
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,640
to which of my fair cousins should i

423
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,880
complement the excellence of the cooking

424
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,360
mr collins we are perfectly able to keep

425
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,400
a cook

426
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,279
excellent i'm very pleased the estate

427
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:02,480
can afford such a living

428
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,440
i'm honored to have as my patroness lady

429
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,880
catherine de berg

430
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:12,559
you've heard of her i presume my

431
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:16,000
small rectory abuts her estate

432
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,880
rosings park and she often contends to

433
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,880
drive by my humble dwelling

434
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,480
in her little fatem and ponies

435
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:28,080
does she have any family one daughter

436
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,520
the heiress of rosian's and very

437
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,679
extensive property

438
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:34,080
i've often observed lady catherine that

439
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:34,960
her daughter

440
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,279
seemed born to be a duchess before she

441
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:38,080
has all

442
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:42,799
the superior graces of elevated rank

443
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:44,159
these are the kind of little delicate

444
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:45,679
compliments which are always acceptable

445
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:49,039
to the ladies in which i conceive myself

446
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:52,799
particularly bound to pay how happy for

447
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:54,000
you mr collins

448
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,919
to possess the talent for flattering

449
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:59,600
with such delicacy

450
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,919
these pleasing attentions proceed from

451
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:03,440
the impulse of the moment

452
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,840
or are they the result of previous study

453
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,360
he arrives chiefly from what is passing

454
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,240
at the time

455
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,919
and though i do sometimes amuse myself

456
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:11,760
with arranging such little elegant

457
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,200
compliments

458
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,120
i always wish to give them as unstudied

459
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,400
an air

460
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:19,600
as possible oh believe me no one would

461
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:23,200
suspect your manners to be rehearsed

462
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:29,360
after dinner i thought i might read to

463
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,919
you all for an hour or two

464
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:34,960
i have with me four dices sermons which

465
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,720
speak very eloquently on all matters

466
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,039
moral

467
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,440

468
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:48,960

oh mr collins unfortunately

480
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:19,360

excellent partner no not you agree

very poor taste in ribbons only a man

506
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,960

you acquainted with him with mr darcy

536
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,039

537
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:14,080
family since infancy

538
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:16,880

539
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,640

00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:21,120

relations with the gentleman oh no it is

544
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:29,600
not for me to be driven away

545
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,600
if he wishes to avoid seeing me he must

546
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,279
go

547
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:37,200
not i i must ask mr wickham

548
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,720
what is the manner of your disapproval

549
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:41,519
of mr darcy

550
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:46,080
my father managed his estate

551
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:49,440
we grew up together darcy and i

552
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,080
his father treated me like a second son

553
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:55,120
loved me like a son

554
00:31:55,600 --> 00:32:00,159
we were both with him the day he died

555
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:02,960
with his last breath his father

556
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,480
bequeathed me directory

557
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:07,120
in his estate he knew i had my heart set

558
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,279
on joining the church

559
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:11,039
but darcy ignored his wishes and gave

560
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:12,880
the living to another man

561
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:17,039
but why jealousy

562
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:20,320
his father

563
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,559
will he love me better and does he

564
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:24,720
couldn't stand it

565
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:27,519
how cruel so now i'm a poor foot soldier

566
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:42,880
too lowly even to be noticed

567
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:45,679
breathe in i can't anymore you're

568
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:47,270

oh i did not think you danced mr collins

609
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:07,520
i do not think it incompatible with the

office of encouragement to indulge in

611
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:09,440
such an

612
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,680
innocent diversion in fact several

00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,680
people with her leadership included have

614
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:16,240

00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:55,440
consequence to me but it doesn't

622
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:59,119
it does have the opportunity to lavish

623
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:02,260
[Music]

624
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,480

00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:09,280
you'd be less delighted to be engaged

627
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:12,000
were it not for the

628
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,200
were it not for the presence of

629
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,800
netherfield of a certain gentleman which

630
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,880
is my primary object to be the gentleman

631
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:19,680
barely wants the name

632
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:22,960
it's my intention if i may be so bold

633
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:26,090

did i just agree to dance with mr darcy

638
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,160
i dare say you will find him very angry

639
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:58,960
about this he

640
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,720
should be most inconvenient since i want

641
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:05,839
to lose him for all eternity

643
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,720

00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:23,359
invigorating

00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:30,720
does your turn to say something mr darcy

646
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,960
i talked about the dance now you want to

647
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,400
remark on the size of the room or the

648
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:37,200
number of couples

649
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,119
i'm perfectly happy to oblige please

650
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:40,720
advise me of what you would like most to

651
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:41,680
hear

652
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:47,440
that reply will do for present

653
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,440
perhaps by and by i may observe that

654
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,880
private rules are much pleasanter than

655
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:53,520
public ones

656
00:38:55,359 --> 00:39:01,839
and now we may remain silent

657
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:09,760
you talk as a ruler while dancing

658
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:12,960
no no i prefer to be unsociable in

659
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:15,839
taciturn

660
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,119
makes it all so much more enjoyable

661
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:21,680
don't you think

662
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:24,720
tell me do you and your sisters very

663
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:29,839
often walk to marathon

664
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:33,440
yes we often walk to marathon

665
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,119
it's a great opportunity to meet new

666
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:37,440
people

667
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,760
but when you met us we just had the

668
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:43,839
pleasure of forming a new acquaintance

669
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:46,000
mr wickham is blessed with such happy

670
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,880
manners he is sure of making friends

671
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,240
whether he's capable of retaining them

672
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:52,160
as less said he's been so unfortunate

673
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:55,119
to lose your friendship

674
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:57,119
and i dare say that is an irreversible

675
00:39:57,119 --> 00:39:58,960
event it is

676
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,560
why do you ask such a question to make

677
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:01,920
out your character mr dawson what have

678
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:02,560
you discovered

679
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,960
very little i hear such different

680
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:08,720
accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly

681
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:13,119

00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:02,720
i must make myself known to him

688
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,240

esteemed patronus lately catherine

mr collins you will consider it an

691
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,680
impertinence

do you have miss elizabeth

696
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:45,200
you've enlightened us long enough and

697
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:49,839
the other young ladies

698
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:54,079
since it was a child and then she died

699
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:56,000
they have a beautiful grave

700
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,680
because caroline's a much better rider

701
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:03,839
than i of course

702
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:09,440
we fully expect a most advantageous

clearly my family are having a

708
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,480
competition to see who can expose

709
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:41,040
themselves to the most ridicule

710
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:45,119
well at least bingley has not noticed no

711
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:46,880
i think he likes her very much but does

712
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,800
she like him

713
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,240
there are a few of us who are secure

714
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:51,520
enough to be really in love with that

00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:53,040
proper encouragement

716
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:55,839
mainly likes her enormously but might

717
00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:58,560
not do more if she does not help him on

718
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:00,560
but she's just shy and modest

719
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:02,000
if you cannot perceive her regard he is

720
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,040
a fool we are all fools in love

721
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:08,319
he does not know her character as we do

722
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:10,800
she should move fast to snap him up

723
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:12,000
there is plenty of time

724
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,520
for us to get to know them after matches

725
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:17,119

762
00:45:58,640 --> 00:45:59,359
where you are

763
00:45:59,359 --> 00:46:01,440
everyone else to the drawing room mr

764
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:03,280
bennett

765
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:05,520
now

766
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:15,140
jane jane

767
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:18,260
[Music]

768
00:46:26,839 --> 00:46:29,839
hmm

769
00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:46,560
dear mr elizabeth i'm sure my attentions

770
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:49,119
have been too marked to be mistaken

771
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:51,839
almost as soon as i entered the house i

772
00:46:51,839 --> 00:46:53,839
singled you out as the companion of my

773
00:46:53,839 --> 00:46:56,960
future life

774
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:58,640
but before i am run away with my

775
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:00,880
feelings perhaps

776
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:03,040
i may state my reasons for marrying

777
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:04,880
firstly that it is the duty of a

778
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:06,240
clergyman to set the example of

779
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,319
matrimony in his parish

780
00:47:08,319 --> 00:47:10,640
secondly that i am convinced it will add

781
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:12,400
greatly to my happiness

782
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:15,920
and thirdly that it is at the urging of

783
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:19,200
my esteemed patroness lady catherine

784
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:22,800
that i select a wife my object in coming

785
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:24,559
to longborn was to choose

786
00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:26,559
such a one from among mr bennett's

787
00:47:26,559 --> 00:47:27,680
daughters for

788
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:31,839
i am to inherit the estate and

789
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:35,040
such an alliance will surely

790
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:38,880
suit everyone

791
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:41,760
and now nothing remains but for me to

792
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:43,680
assure you in the most animated language

793
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:45,520
of the violence of my affection mr

794
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:46,400
collins

795
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:48,240
and that no reproach on the subject of

796
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:49,839
fortune will cross my lips once we're

797
00:47:49,839 --> 00:47:50,480
married

798
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:52,079
you are too hasty sir you forget that i

799
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:54,400
have given no answer i must add that

800
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:56,240
lady catherine will thoroughly approve

801
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:58,160
when i speak to her of your modesty

802
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:02,559
economy and other amiable qualities

803
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:05,520
sir i am honored by your proposal but i

804
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:08,720
regret that i must decline it

805
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:11,920
i know ladies don't seek to seem

806
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:13,920
too easy mr collins i am perfectly

807
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:15,119
serious

808
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:16,480
you could not make me happy and i'm

809
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:17,680
convinced i'm the last woman in the

810
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:20,079
world who could make you happy

811
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:22,079
i've let myself constantly your refusal

812
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:24,880
is merely a natural delicacy

813
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:26,319
besides you should take into account

814
00:48:26,319 --> 00:48:28,079
that despite your manifold attractions

815
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:29,680
it's by no means certain that another

816
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:31,200
offer of marriage may ever be made to

817
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:31,440
you

818
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:33,839
mr collins so i must conclude that you

819
00:48:33,839 --> 00:48:35,440
simply seek to increase my love by

820
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:36,160
suspense

821
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:38,160
sir according to the usual practice of

822
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:40,880
elegant females sir

823
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:43,040
i am not the sort of female to torment a

824
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:44,559
respectable man

825
00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:49,839
please understand me i cannot accept you

826
00:48:54,400 --> 00:49:03,839
a strong foolish child

827
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:08,160
don't worry mr collins we'll have this

828
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:17,839
before he comes out with immediately

829
00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:26,559
you must come and make lizzie marry mr

830
00:49:26,559 --> 00:49:28,400
collins

831
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:31,440
mr collins has proposed to lizzy but she

vow she will not have him

833
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:36,319

834
00:49:36,319 --> 00:49:38,400

people who suffer as i do from nervous

864
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:54,559

865
00:50:54,559 --> 00:50:56,960
talking to anybody

from netherfield

872
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:05,839
why would he not know when he was to

873
00:52:05,839 --> 00:52:09,599
return read it i don't mind

874
00:52:17,119 --> 00:52:19,200
mr darcy is impatient to see his sister

875
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:20,720
and we are scarce with his ego to meet

876
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:21,839
her again

877
00:52:21,839 --> 00:52:23,680
i really do not think georgiana darcy

878
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:25,599
has her equal for beauty elegance and

879
00:52:25,599 --> 00:52:26,400
accomplishment

880
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:28,079
so much so i must hope to hear after

881
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:30,839
call her my sister is that not clear

882
00:52:30,839 --> 00:52:33,520
enough caroline sees that her brother is

883
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:34,720
in love with you

884
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:36,559
and has taken him off to persuade him

885
00:52:36,559 --> 00:52:39,200
otherwise but i know her to be incapable

886
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:42,480
of willfully deceiving anyone

887
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:44,000
it's far more likely that he does not

888
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,839
love me and never he loves you jane do

889
00:52:45,839 --> 00:52:48,480

he will come to you

893
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:08,480
give my love to my sister and try not to

894
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:11,680
be a burden dear

895
00:53:12,839 --> 00:53:15,680
aung a girl likes to be crossed in love

896
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:17,200
now and then

897
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:19,599
it gives her something to think of and a

898
00:53:19,599 --> 00:53:20,240
sort of

899
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:22,960
distinction amongst her companion i'm

900
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:24,720

1004
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:18,640
wife

1005
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:33,839

1007
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:47,839
miss elizabeth

1008
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:53,440
my eldest sister is currently in london

1009
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:55,839
perhaps you happen to see her there

1010
00:59:55,839 --> 00:59:57,359
i haven't been fortunate enough play the

1011
00:59:57,359 --> 01:00:01,680
piano forte miss bennett

1012
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:05,440
a little mom and very poorly oh

1013
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:09,599
you draw no not at all

1014
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:13,359
your sisters do they draw not one

1015
01:00:13,359 --> 01:00:16,319
it's very strange i suppose you had no

1016
01:00:16,319 --> 01:00:18,079
opportunity

1017
01:00:18,079 --> 01:00:19,520
your mother should have taken you to

1018
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:20,960
town every spring for the benefit of the

1019
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:22,640
masters i'm sure my mother wouldn't have

1020
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:26,240
minded but my father hates town

1021
01:00:26,319 --> 01:00:29,040
has your governance left you we never

1022
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:31,280
had a governess

1023
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:34,480
no governors five daughters brought up

1024
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:35,920
at home without a governess i never

1025
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:37,680
heard such a thing

1026
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:39,119
your mother must have been quite a slave

1027
01:00:39,119 --> 01:00:41,040
to your education not at all lady

1028
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:43,839
catherine

1029
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:48,799
your younger sisters are they out in

1030
01:00:48,799 --> 01:00:50,799
society yes ma'am all

1031
01:00:50,799 --> 01:00:53,839
or would all five out at once oh that's

1032
01:00:53,839 --> 01:00:54,880
very odd

1033
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:57,280
and you only the second the younger ones

1034
01:00:57,280 --> 01:00:59,440
out before the elders are married

1035
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:02,480
your youngest sisters must be very young

1036
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:05,520
yes my youngest is not 16.

1037
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:06,799
but i think it would be very hard on

1038
01:01:06,799 --> 01:01:08,160
younger sisters not to have their share

1039
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:09,760
of amusement because the elder is still

1040
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:11,200
unmarried

1041
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:12,720
it would hardly encourage sisterly

1042
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:14,400
affection

1043
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:16,319
upon my word you give your opinion very

1044
01:01:16,319 --> 01:01:19,599
decidedly for so younger person

1045
01:01:19,599 --> 01:01:23,119
pray what is your age with three younger

1046
01:01:23,119 --> 01:01:24,640
sisters grown up your leadership can

1047
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:28,160
hardly expect me to own to it

1048
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:39,839
come miss bennett and play for us

1049
01:01:39,839 --> 01:01:43,359
no i beg you for music is my delight

1050
01:01:43,359 --> 01:01:45,680
in fact there are few people in england

1051
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:47,680
who have more true enjoyment of music

1052
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:49,920
than myself

1053
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:53,119
or better natural taste if i had ever

1054
01:01:53,119 --> 01:01:54,480
learned

1055
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:58,240
i should have been a great proficient

1056
01:01:58,240 --> 01:02:01,119
so dan if her health would have allowed

1057
01:02:01,119 --> 01:02:02,640
her

1058
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:04,240
lady catherine i'm not afflicted with

1059
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:06,640
false modesty when i say i play poorly

1060
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:08,640
come come lizzy

1061
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:21,839
her leadership demands it

1062
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:36,000
how does georgiana get along darcy

1063
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:40,079
she plays very well i hope she practices

1064
01:02:40,079 --> 01:02:42,000
no excellence can be acquired without

1065
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,319
constant practice i've told mrs collins

1066
01:02:44,319 --> 01:02:45,760
this

1067
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:47,119
though you have no instrument of your

1068
01:02:47,119 --> 01:02:48,400
own you're very welcome to come to

1069
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:49,200
rosings

1070
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:50,640
and play on the piano forte in the

1071
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:52,400
housekeeper's room thank you

1072
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:54,720
you'll be in nobody's way in that part

1073
01:02:54,720 --> 01:03:03,520
of the house

1074
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:05,520
you mean to frighten me mr darcy by

1075
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:08,720
coming in all your state to hear me

1076
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:10,240
but i won't be alarmed even if your

1077
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:11,920
sister does play so well i am well

1078
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:13,119
enough acquainted with you miss

1079
01:03:13,119 --> 01:03:14,640
elizabeth to know that i cannot allow

1080
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:17,039
you even should i wish it

1081
01:03:17,039 --> 01:03:18,990
what was my friend like in hertfordshire

1082
01:03:18,990 --> 01:03:21,520
[Music]

1083
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:25,039
you really care to know prepare yourself

1084
01:03:25,039 --> 01:03:27,599
for something very dreadful

1085
01:03:27,599 --> 01:03:29,359
the first time i saw him at the assembly

1086
01:03:29,359 --> 01:03:31,200
he danced with nobody at all

1087
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:32,799
even though gentlemen were scarce and

1088
01:03:32,799 --> 01:03:34,079
there was more than one young lady

1089
01:03:34,079 --> 01:03:35,839
sitting down without a partner i knew

1090
01:03:35,839 --> 01:03:37,920
nobody be on my own party oh and nobody

1091
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:39,520
can be introduced in a ballroom but

1092
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:40,240
william

1093
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:45,839
i need you

1094
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:56,559
i do not have the talent of conversing

1095
01:03:56,559 --> 01:03:58,160
easily with people i have never met

1096
01:03:58,160 --> 01:03:59,359
before

1097
01:03:59,359 --> 01:04:00,640
perhaps you should take your aunt's

1098
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:13,790
advice and practice

1099
01:04:13,790 --> 01:04:16,929
[Applause]

1100
01:04:21,240 --> 01:04:24,310

1101
01:04:24,839 --> 01:04:28,720
yeah jane

1102
01:04:39,119 --> 01:04:41,839
mr darcy

1103
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:55,760
please do be seated

1104
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:57,359
i'm afraid mr and mrs collins have gone

1105
01:04:57,359 --> 01:05:00,319
on business to the village

1106
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:08,799
this is a charming house i believe my

1107
01:05:08,799 --> 01:05:10,079
aunt did a great deal to it when mr

1108
01:05:10,079 --> 01:05:13,039
collins first arrived

1109
01:05:13,119 --> 01:05:15,839
i believe so

1110
01:05:16,559 --> 01:05:18,160
she could not have bestowed her kindness

1111
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:23,839
on a more grateful subject

1112
01:05:30,079 --> 01:05:37,440
so i call for some tea no thank you

1113
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:38,960
good day thanks elizabeth it's been a

1114
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:41,280
pleasure

1115
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:48,839
what enough have you done to promise to

1116
01:05:48,839 --> 01:05:50,480
darcy

1117
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:53,440
i have no idea

1118
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:57,119
every mind must have some counsellor to

1119
01:05:57,119 --> 01:05:58,000
whom it may

1120
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,880
apply for consolation in distress there

1121
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:02,799
are many conveniences which others can

1122
01:06:02,799 --> 01:06:04,799
supply and which we cannot procure for

1123
01:06:04,799 --> 01:06:05,680
ourselves

1124
01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:07,280
i have now principally in view those

1125
01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:09,680
objects which are only to be obtained

1126
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:12,640
through intercourse

1127
01:06:13,359 --> 01:06:15,440
forgive me through the intercourse of

1128
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:18,720
friendship or civility

1129
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:20,720
on such occasions the proud man steps

1130
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:22,559
forth to meet you not with the

1131
01:06:22,559 --> 01:06:24,640
cordiality of affection

1132
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:27,119
but with the suspicion the one who

1133
01:06:27,119 --> 01:06:29,039
reckon noiters an enemy

1134
01:06:29,039 --> 01:06:33,839
who is ready

1135
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:36,720
everyone appears to be at his disposal

1136
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:38,160
nobody doesn't marry and secure a

1137
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:40,559
lasting convenience of that kind

1138
01:06:40,559 --> 01:06:43,200
which makes you want to be a lucky woman

1139
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:44,880
cry really

01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:51,200
he recently came to the rescue of one of

1142
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:53,520
his friends just in time what happened

1143
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:56,880
he saved the man from an improved

1144
01:06:58,839 --> 01:07:01,839
marriage

1145
01:07:11,599 --> 01:07:13,280
there were apparently strong objections

1146
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:14,960
to the lady

1147
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:18,400
what kind of objections i lack a fortune

1148
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:20,240
i think it was a family that was

1149
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:23,280
considered unsuitable

1150
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:27,039
so he separated them i believe so i know

1151
01:07:27,039 --> 01:07:29,839
nothing else

and i can bear it no longer

these past months have been a torment i

1159
01:08:05,839 --> 01:08:07,200
came to roses with a single object of

1160
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:08,799
seeing you i had to see

1161
01:08:08,799 --> 01:08:10,400

them aside and ask you

1166
01:08:16,158 --> 01:08:18,158

1170
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:31,759
hand

caused you pain

1174
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:43,839

01:08:43,839 --> 01:08:47,279
is this your time yes sir are you

1176
01:08:47,279 --> 01:08:49,439
are you laughing at me no are you

1177
01:08:49,439 --> 01:08:50,960
rejecting me i'm sure that the feelings

1178
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:52,158
which is you've told me have hindered

1179
01:08:52,158 --> 01:08:53,759
your regard will help you in overcoming

1180
01:08:53,759 --> 01:08:55,839
it

1181
01:08:55,839 --> 01:08:58,000
might i ask why would so little endeavor

1182
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,679
civility i must repulse and i might as

1183
01:08:59,679 --> 01:09:01,279
well inquire why would so evident in

1184
01:09:01,279 --> 01:09:02,960
design of insulting me you chose to tell

1185
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:04,839
me that you like me against your better

1186
01:09:04,839 --> 01:09:05,198
judgment me

1187
01:09:05,198 --> 01:09:06,719
if i was uncivil then that is some

1188
01:09:06,719 --> 01:09:08,238
excuse but i have other reasons you know

1189
01:09:08,238 --> 01:09:08,719
i have

1190
01:09:08,719 --> 01:09:11,040
what reasons just think of anything

1191
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:12,799
might tempt me to accept a man who was

1192
01:09:12,799 --> 01:09:14,560
ruined perhaps forever the happiness of

1193
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:17,279
her most beloved sister

1194
01:09:17,279 --> 01:09:20,960
you deny it mr darcy that you separated

1195
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:22,319
a young couple who loved each other

1196
01:09:22,319 --> 01:09:23,839
exposing your friend to the center of

1197
01:09:23,839 --> 01:09:25,759
the world for caprice and my sister

1198
01:09:25,759 --> 01:09:27,920
to its derision for disappointed hopes

1199
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:29,359
and involving them both in misery of the

1200
01:09:29,359 --> 01:09:30,000
acute his car

1201
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:33,920
i do not deny it how could you do it

1202
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:35,040
because i believed your sister

1203
01:09:35,040 --> 01:09:35,920
indifferently

1204
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:37,279
indifferent i watched them most

1205
01:09:37,279 --> 01:09:38,560
carefully and realized his attachment

1206
01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:40,000
was deeper than her that's because she's

1207
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:40,479
shy

1208
01:09:40,479 --> 01:09:42,080
bingley too is modest and was persuaded

1209
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:43,359
she didn't feel strongly because you

1210
01:09:43,359 --> 01:09:45,198
suggested it i did it for his own

1211
01:09:45,198 --> 01:09:46,960
my sister hardy shows her true feelings

1212
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:49,839
to me

1213
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:55,600
i suppose you suspect his his fortune

1214
01:09:55,600 --> 01:09:56,320
had something

1215
01:09:56,320 --> 01:09:57,600
i wouldn't be your sister the dishonor

1216
01:09:57,600 --> 01:10:00,320
though it was suggested what was

1217
01:10:00,320 --> 01:10:01,760
it was made perfectly clear that in

1218
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:03,520
advantageous marriage did my sister give

1219
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:04,400
that impression no

1220
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:07,199
no no there was however i have to admit

1221
01:10:07,199 --> 01:10:08,560
the matter of your family i want of

1222
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:09,360
connection

1223
01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:10,719
mr bingley didn't seem to because

1224
01:10:10,719 --> 01:10:12,560
himself about that how sir it was the

1225
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:14,239
lack of propriety showed by your mother

1226
01:10:14,239 --> 01:10:15,440
your three younger sisters even on the

1227
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:18,110
case of your father

[Music]

1229
01:10:23,679 --> 01:10:30,719
you and your sister i must exclude this

1230
01:10:30,719 --> 01:10:34,000
and what about mr wickham

1231
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:37,040
mr wickham what excuse can you give you

1232
01:10:37,040 --> 01:10:38,800
your behavior towards him you take an

1233
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:40,320
eager interest in that gentleman he told

1234
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:41,360
me of his misfortune

1235
01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:43,040
oh your sister's fortunes have been very

1236
01:10:43,040 --> 01:10:44,880
great indeed you ruin his chances and

1237
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:47,040
let you treat him with sarcasm

1238
01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:50,080
so this is your opinion of me thank you

1239
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:51,520
for explaining so fully

1240
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:52,640
perhaps these offenses might have been

1241
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:54,159
overlooked had not your pride been hurt

1242
01:10:54,159 --> 01:10:55,840
by my honesty and admitting scruples

1243
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:57,199
about our relationship

1244
01:10:57,199 --> 01:10:58,960
could you expect me to rejoice in the

1245
01:10:58,960 --> 01:11:00,960
inferiority of your circumstances

1246
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:03,520
and those are the words of a gentleman

1247
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:05,040
from the first moment i met you your

1248
01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:06,800
arrogance and conceit your selfish

1249
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:08,400
disdain for the feelings of others

1250
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:09,920
made me realize that you were the last

1251
01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:11,520
man in the world i could ever be

1252
01:11:11,520 --> 01:11:14,640
prevailed upon to marry

1253
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:28,719
forgive me madam for taking up so much

1254
01:11:28,719 --> 01:11:41,840
of your time

so

1264
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:47,040
i came to leave you this

1265
01:13:47,040 --> 01:13:48,560
i shall not renew the sentiments which

1266
01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:51,040
was so disgusting to you

1267
01:13:51,040 --> 01:13:52,800
but if i may i will address the two

1268
01:13:52,800 --> 01:14:01,840
offences you've laid against me

1269
01:14:02,320 --> 01:14:05,520
my father loved mr wickham as a son

1270
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:07,199
in consequence he left him a generous

1271
01:14:07,199 --> 01:14:09,760
living but upon my father's death mr

1272
01:14:09,760 --> 01:14:11,520
wickham announced he had no intention of

1273
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:14,159
taking orders

1274
01:14:14,159 --> 01:14:15,600
he demanded the value of the living

1275
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:17,760
which he was given and which he gambled

1276
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:20,640
away within weeks

1277
01:14:22,320 --> 01:14:24,159
he then wrote demanding more money which

1278
01:14:24,159 --> 01:14:25,760
i refused

1279
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:28,960
after which he served all acquaintance

1280
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:31,280
he came back to see us last summer at

1281
01:14:31,280 --> 01:14:32,800
which point he declared passionate love

1282
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:34,400
for my sister whom he tried to persuade

1283
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:37,199
to elope with him

1284
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:41,440
she is to inherit 30 000 pounds

1285
01:14:41,440 --> 01:14:42,880
when it was made clear he would never

1286
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:44,640
receive a penny of that inheritance he

1287
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:47,040
disappeared

1288
01:14:47,040 --> 01:14:48,640
i will not attempt to convey the depth

1289
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:50,960
of georgiana's despair

1290
01:14:50,960 --> 01:14:56,000
she was 15 years old

1291
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:57,360
as to the other matter that of your

1292
01:14:57,360 --> 01:14:59,760
sister and mr bingley

1293
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:01,120
though the motives which governed me

1294
01:15:01,120 --> 01:15:03,600
mater you appear insufficient

1295
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:07,040
they were in the service of a friend

1296
01:15:07,440 --> 01:15:11,840
is he

1297
01:15:12,320 --> 01:15:25,840

1298
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:29,120
listen how fortunate you have arrived

1299
01:15:29,120 --> 01:15:31,199
your aunt and uncle are here to deliver

01:15:31,199 --> 01:15:32,800
jane from london

01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:39,440
how is jane i was in the drawing room

i'm quite over him lizzy if you passed

1303
01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:45,199
me in the street i'd hardly notice

1304
01:15:45,199 --> 01:15:50,239
london is so diverting it's true

1305
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:53,840
there's so much to entertain

1306
01:15:59,199 --> 01:16:02,320
what news is from kent

1307
01:16:04,840 --> 01:16:06,640
nothing

1308
01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:10,080
at least not much to entertain

1309
01:16:11,360 --> 01:16:15,440
oh kitty stop making such a fuss

1310
01:16:15,440 --> 01:16:17,280
i probably can't afford it some better

1311
01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:18,719
company

1312
01:16:18,719 --> 01:16:20,880

has been invited to go to brighton with

1314
01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:26,719
the forces you could see bathing would

1315
01:16:26,719 --> 01:16:29,199
set me up very nicely sit down with the

1316
01:16:29,199 --> 01:16:31,120
officers every night

1317
01:16:31,120 --> 01:16:33,600
please papar don't let her go lily will

1318
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:35,679
never be easy until she's exposed

1319
01:16:35,679 --> 01:16:37,760
herself in some public place or other

1320
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:39,280
and we can never expect her to do it

1321
01:16:39,280 --> 01:16:41,040
with so little inconveniences under the

1322
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:42,640
present circumstances

1323
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:44,080
if you dear father do not take the

1324
01:16:44,080 --> 01:16:45,520
trouble to check her she will be fixed

1325
01:16:45,520 --> 01:16:46,719
forever as the silliest and most

1326
01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:48,239
determined flirt who ever made her

1327
01:16:48,239 --> 01:16:49,760
family ridiculous

1328
01:16:49,760 --> 01:16:51,840
and kitty will follow as she always does

1329
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:53,120
lizzy we shall have

1330
01:16:53,120 --> 01:16:56,800
no peace until she goes

1331
01:16:56,800 --> 01:17:00,320
is that really all you care about

1332
01:17:00,560 --> 01:17:04,080
what kind of fosters a sense of a man

1333
01:17:04,080 --> 01:17:05,520
you will keep her out of any real

1334
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:07,120
mischief

1335
01:17:07,120 --> 01:17:08,960
and she's far too poor to be an object

1336
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:10,159
to pray to anyone

1337
01:17:10,159 --> 01:17:13,280
father it's dangerous i am certain

1338
01:17:13,280 --> 01:17:15,440
the officers will find women better if

1339
01:17:15,440 --> 01:17:17,120
there were

1340
01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:20,000
let us hope in fact that her stay in

1341
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:21,360
brighton

1342
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:26,159
would teach her her own insignificance

1343
01:17:26,159 --> 01:17:29,280
generation hard to grow any worse if she

1344
01:17:29,280 --> 01:17:30,239
does

1345
01:17:30,239 --> 01:17:31,920
you'd be obliged to lock her up for the

1346
01:17:31,920 --> 01:17:34,640
rest of her life

1347
01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:44,960

the peak district is not brighton and

1350

1351
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:51,840

1352
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:54,159

1356

1357
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:02,719
arrogance or stupidity

1358
01:18:02,719 --> 01:18:04,239
if they are amiable they're so easily

1359
01:18:04,239 --> 01:18:05,440

being open with my sisters

1483
01:30:57,120 --> 01:31:00,320

1570
01:35:26,159 --> 01:35:28,639
was thinking of my dear wicker

01:35:28,639 --> 01:35:30,159
i want to know whether he'd been married

1572
01:35:30,159 --> 01:35:32,320
in his blue coat the northern england i

1573
01:35:32,320 --> 01:35:32,960
believe there's

some spectacular scene away from the

01:35:35,679 --> 01:35:37,840
church or business and i thought

1576
01:35:37,840 --> 01:35:39,520
who is to be our best man if he doesn't

1577
01:35:39,520 --> 01:35:41,679

meet us in different acquaintances

1693
01:42:35,280 --> 01:42:37,760
oh yes no you cannot think me so weak as

1694
01:42:37,760 --> 01:42:39,600
to be in danger now

1695
01:42:39,600 --> 01:42:41,119
i think you are in great danger of

1696
01:42:41,119 --> 01:42:42,880
making him as much in love with you as

1697
01:42:42,880 --> 01:42:44,960
ever

1698
01:42:44,960 --> 01:42:46,320

1705
01:43:16,560 --> 01:43:17,920

1706
01:43:17,920 --> 01:43:20,960

1715
01:44:03,840 --> 01:44:07,840
comprehensive ass

1716
01:44:32,840 --> 01:44:35,840

01:44:37,360 --> 01:44:43,280

1724
01:45:37,360 --> 01:45:39,119
i am confident they will do well

01:45:39,119 --> 01:45:41,520
together

1726
01:45:41,920 --> 01:45:45,840
their tempers are much alike

1727
01:45:47,280 --> 01:45:49,280
they will be cheated assiduously by

1728
01:45:49,280 --> 01:45:51,199
their servants

1729
01:45:51,199 --> 01:45:54,480
and be so generous with the rest

1730
01:45:54,480 --> 01:45:58,000
who will always exceed their income

1731
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:03,070
their income here's 5 000 a year

1733
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:08,639
i knew she could not be so beautiful for

1734
01:46:08,639 --> 01:46:10,840
nothing

1735
01:46:10,840 --> 01:46:12,110

[Music]

1737
01:46:20,320 --> 01:46:22,239
she only can address herself effectually

1738
01:46:22,239 --> 01:46:24,320
to the heart and the feelings of others

1739
01:46:24,320 --> 01:46:26,719
whose mind glows with the warmth of

1740

sensibility

1741
01:46:27,840 --> 01:46:29,360
and whose arguments result from

1742
01:46:29,360 --> 01:46:32,159
conviction she must feel the influence

1743
01:46:32,159 --> 01:46:33,280
of those passions

1744
01:46:33,280 --> 01:46:36,400
and emotions which she wishes to inspire

1745
01:46:36,400 --> 01:46:41,840
an assumed character

1746
01:46:41,840 --> 01:46:55,840
i love you

1747
01:46:59,040 --> 01:47:02,239
can you die of happiness

1748
01:47:02,239 --> 01:47:03,840
do you know he was totally ignorant of

1749
01:47:03,840 --> 01:47:05,280
my being in town in the spring

1750
01:47:05,280 --> 01:47:07,280
how did he account for he thought me

1751
01:47:07,280 --> 01:47:08,800
different

1752
01:47:08,800 --> 01:47:11,119
unfathomable loadout poisoned by his

1753
01:47:11,119 --> 01:47:12,639
pernicious sister

1754
01:47:12,639 --> 01:47:15,119
bravo i think that's the most

1755
01:47:15,119 --> 01:47:18,560
unforgiving speech you've ever made

1756
01:47:18,560 --> 01:47:20,880
oh lizzy if i could but see you so happy

1757
01:47:20,880 --> 01:47:24,639
if there was such another man for you

1758
01:47:26,880 --> 01:47:37,840
perhaps mr collins has a cousin

1759
01:47:49,119 --> 01:47:51,840
catherine

1760
01:47:56,560 --> 01:47:59,679
the rest of your offspring i presume

1761
01:47:59,679 --> 01:48:01,760
all but one the youngest has been lately

1762
01:48:01,760 --> 01:48:03,600
married your ladyship

1763
01:48:03,600 --> 01:48:05,760
and my eldest was proposed to only this

1764
01:48:05,760 --> 01:48:08,320
afternoon

1765
01:48:08,400 --> 01:48:10,960
you have a very small garden madam could

1766
01:48:10,960 --> 01:48:12,719
i offer you a cup of tea perhaps

1767
01:48:12,719 --> 01:48:14,960
absolutely not i need to speak to miss

1768
01:48:14,960 --> 01:48:16,800
elizabeth bennett alone

1769
01:48:16,800 --> 01:48:19,840
as a matter of urgency

1770
01:48:22,960 --> 01:48:24,639
you can be at no loss miss bennett to

1771
01:48:24,639 --> 01:48:26,480
understand why i am here

1772
01:48:26,480 --> 01:48:28,159
indeed you are mistaken i cannot account

1773
01:48:28,159 --> 01:48:29,760
for this honor at all miss bennett i

1774
01:48:29,760 --> 01:48:30,719
warn you

1775
01:48:30,719 --> 01:48:34,080
i am not to be trifled with a report of

1776
01:48:34,080 --> 01:48:35,920
the most alarming nature has reached me

1777
01:48:35,920 --> 01:48:37,840
that you intend to be united with my

1778
01:48:37,840 --> 01:48:38,719
nephew

1779
01:48:38,719 --> 01:48:42,239
mr darcy i know this to be a scandalous

1780
01:48:42,239 --> 01:48:43,280
falsehood

1781
01:48:43,280 --> 01:48:44,639
though not wishing to injure him by

1782
01:48:44,639 --> 01:48:46,560
supposing it possible i instantly set

1783
01:48:46,560 --> 01:48:48,400
off to make my sentiments known

1784
01:48:48,400 --> 01:48:50,000
if you believed it to be impossible i

1785
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:51,520
wonder you took the trouble of coming so

1786
01:48:51,520 --> 01:48:53,280
far to hear it contradicted miss bennett

1787
01:48:53,280 --> 01:48:54,400
your coming will be rather a

1788
01:48:54,400 --> 01:48:55,199
confirmation

1789
01:48:55,199 --> 01:48:58,480
surely if indeed such a reporting if

1790
01:48:58,480 --> 01:49:00,960
do you then pretend to be ignorant of it

1791
01:49:00,960 --> 01:49:02,880
has it not been industriously circulated

1792
01:49:02,880 --> 01:49:05,920
by yourself i have never heard of it

1793
01:49:05,920 --> 01:49:07,199
and can you declare there is no

1794
01:49:07,199 --> 01:49:09,600
foundation for it do not pretend to

1795
01:49:09,600 --> 01:49:11,040
possess equal frankness with your

1796
01:49:11,040 --> 01:49:12,080
ladyship

1797
01:49:12,080 --> 01:49:13,520
you may ask a question which i may

1798
01:49:13,520 --> 01:49:14,960
choose not to answer this is not to be

1799
01:49:14,960 --> 01:49:15,679
born

1800
01:49:15,679 --> 01:49:17,040
has my nephew made you an offer of

1801
01:49:17,040 --> 01:49:18,719
marriage your ladyship has declared it

1802
01:49:18,719 --> 01:49:20,960
to be impossible let me be understood

1803
01:49:20,960 --> 01:49:23,840
mr darcy is engaged to my daughter now

1804
01:49:23,840 --> 01:49:24,719
what have you to say

1805
01:49:24,719 --> 01:49:26,239
only this if that is the case you can

1806
01:49:26,239 --> 01:49:27,679
have no reason to suppose he would make

1807
01:49:27,679 --> 01:49:28,800
an offer to me you

1808
01:49:28,800 --> 01:49:31,840
selfish girl this union has been planned

1809
01:49:31,840 --> 01:49:33,840
since their infancy

1810
01:49:33,840 --> 01:49:35,360
do you think it can be prevented by a

1811
01:49:35,360 --> 01:49:37,360
young woman of inferior birth

1812
01:49:37,360 --> 01:49:39,760
whose own sister's elopement resulted in

1813
01:49:39,760 --> 01:49:40,960
a scandalously

1814
01:49:40,960 --> 01:49:43,280
patched up marriage only achieved at the

1815
01:49:43,280 --> 01:49:45,360

1817
01:49:47,280 --> 01:49:49,599
pemberley to be thus polluted

01:49:51,440 --> 01:49:54,000

such an engagement i will not and i

1824
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:08,239
you have insulted me in every possible

1825
01:50:08,239 --> 01:50:09,760
way and can now have nothing further to

amends for such baby

after what you have done for lydia and i

1854

you are too generous to travel with me

1859
01:53:49,760 --> 01:53:51,199
i believe you spoke with my aunt last

1860
01:53:51,199 --> 01:53:53,119
night and has taught me to hope

1861
01:53:53,119 --> 01:53:56,880
as i'd scarcely allowed myself before

1862
01:53:57,520 --> 01:53:58,719
if your feelings are still what they

1863
01:53:58,719 --> 01:54:02,320
were last april tell me so at once

1864
01:54:02,719 --> 01:54:04,159
my affections and wishes have not

1865
01:54:04,159 --> 01:54:05,920
changed

1866
01:54:05,920 --> 01:54:07,440
but one word from you will silence me

1867
01:54:07,440 --> 01:54:09,840
forever

1868
01:54:14,400 --> 01:54:19,599
if however your feelings have changed

1869
01:54:21,280 --> 01:54:24,159
i would have to tell you you have

1870
01:54:24,159 --> 01:54:25,760

1871
01:54:25,760 --> 01:54:30,080

they say are you out of your senses

1881
01:55:54,800 --> 01:56:00,159
i thought you hated the man no papa

1882
01:56:00,159 --> 01:56:03,040
rich to be sure if he would have more

1883
01:56:03,040 --> 01:56:05,920
fine carriages than jane

1884
01:56:05,920 --> 01:56:09,119
but would that make you happy have you

1885
01:56:09,119 --> 01:56:10,800
no other objection than your belief in

1886
01:56:10,800 --> 01:56:13,599
my indifference

1887
01:56:15,520 --> 01:56:18,480
we all know him to be a proud unpleasant

1888
01:56:18,480 --> 01:56:20,639
sort of fellow

1889
01:56:20,639 --> 01:56:22,480
but this would be nothing if you really

1890
01:56:22,480 --> 01:56:25,920
liked him i do like him

1891
01:56:27,280 --> 01:56:29,840

1892
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:35,119
he's not proud i was wrong i was

1893
01:56:35,119 --> 01:56:38,719
entirely wrong about him

1894
01:56:39,920 --> 01:56:42,080
you don't know how if i told you what he

1895
01:56:42,080 --> 01:56:43,599
was really like

1896
01:56:43,599 --> 01:56:56,080
what he's done what has he done

1897
01:56:56,080 --> 01:56:59,040
she doesn't like him i thought she

1898
01:56:59,040 --> 01:57:03,360
didn't like him so did i say did we all

1899
01:57:03,440 --> 01:57:07,199

1904
01:57:28,080 --> 01:57:30,239
it

1905
01:57:30,480 --> 01:57:32,320
we misjudged him for party more than

1906
01:57:32,320 --> 01:57:33,679
anyone in

1907
01:57:33,679 --> 01:57:38,000
in every way not just in this matter

1908
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:41,040
i've been nonsensical

1909
01:57:41,040 --> 01:57:44,560
he's been a fool about about jane

1910
01:57:44,560 --> 01:57:48,159
about so many other things but

1911
01:57:48,400 --> 01:57:53,280
then so have i

1912
01:57:53,280 --> 01:57:56,159
he and i are

1913
01:57:57,360 --> 01:58:00,639
he and i are so similar

1914
01:58:01,119 --> 01:58:07,840
we've been so stubborn

1915
01:58:11,760 --> 01:58:15,360
you really do love him don't you

1916
01:58:15,360 --> 01:58:21,840
very much

1917
01:58:21,920 --> 01:58:25,440
i cannot believe that anyone can deserve

1918
01:58:25,440 --> 01:58:27,599
you

1919
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:32,159
but it seems i am overruled

1920
01:58:32,320 --> 01:58:35,360
so i heartily

1921
01:58:35,360 --> 01:58:38,400

1922
01:58:45,280 --> 01:58:48,480
