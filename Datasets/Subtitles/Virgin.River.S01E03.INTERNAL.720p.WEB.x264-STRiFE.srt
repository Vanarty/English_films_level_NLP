1
00:00:09,175 --> 00:00:10,505
You're Chloe's mother.

2
00:00:14,556 --> 00:00:17,726
You... you said she wasn't eating.
I thought I could help.

3
00:00:17,809 --> 00:00:19,769
- I'm really sorry.
- Oh. Oh, my gosh.

4
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:21,403
I gotta go. I have to go.

5
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:25,779
Listen, wait. I... I should tell you
that I called Social Services.

6
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:28,610
What does that mean?

7
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,820
They're coming tomorrow
to take custody of Chloe.

8
00:00:36,786 --> 00:00:38,286
Oh... Sorry...

9
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:39,411
Hello, Lilly...

10
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:43,126
Now what'd you do?

11
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:47,672
Lilly is Chloe's mother.

12
00:00:48,089 --> 00:00:49,759
Wh... And what proof do you have?

13
00:00:49,841 --> 00:00:51,971
I just found her breastfeeding the baby.

14
00:00:53,636 --> 00:00:56,006
Oh, you have no idea
what you're talking about.

15
00:00:57,474 --> 00:00:59,484
Uh... Are you being serious?

16
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:03,440
Unlike you city people, folks around here,
we don't just leap to conclusions.

17
00:01:03,521 --> 00:01:05,071
Oh, really? Okay.

18
00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:08,738
Because you made up your mind about me
before we even started working together.

19
00:01:08,818 --> 00:01:11,278
Oh, no, no, no.
That was professional intuition.

20
00:01:11,946 --> 00:01:15,486
Hm. Okay. Well, Lilly just admitted
to being Chloe's mother,

21
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:19,155
which leads me to believe that your
intuition is as outdated as your office.

22
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:45,771
Come back to bed.

23
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,360
I, uh... gotta get to work.

24
00:01:54,739 --> 00:01:56,409
I'll make it worth your while.

25
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,160
I'm late as it is.

26
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:03,119
Can't Preacher open the bar?

27
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:04,366
Hm?

28
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:06,213
Oh, I just gotta check in.

29
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:07,543
Hmm.

30
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:11,920
My first client at the salon
isn't until nine.

31
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:14,344
I can make you breakfast in bed.

32
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:18,345
I gotta go.

33
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:19,805
Okay.

34
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:23,270
- Oh, next Friday...
- Yeah.

35
00:02:23,351 --> 00:02:26,981
...I was thinking, after dinner,
I could spend the night at your place.

36
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:29,439
Hm?

37
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:31,688
It's our two-year anniversary.

38
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:34,696
- Oh.
- Mm.

39
00:02:36,072 --> 00:02:37,122
See, um...

40
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:41,409
I didn't think we were
doing anniversaries.

41
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:42,544
Well...

42
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,040
maybe it's time we started.

43
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:49,464
I just thought it might be nice.

44
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:52,632
Well, things are nice...

45
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:55,184
the way they are.

46
00:03:09,397 --> 00:03:12,277
- She is a loose cannon.
- You can't fire Mel.

47
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:13,738
Yeah, she broke protocol.

48
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:15,108
This isn't the army.

49
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:17,655
No, it is my business,
and I get to run it the w...

50
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:21,655
Well, you have made quite a mess.

51
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:25,753
We are mandated by law
to report child abandonment.

52
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:27,000
I made the right decision.

53
00:03:27,081 --> 00:03:28,171
Don't you lecture me.

54
00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:29,459
I'm not lecturing you.

55
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:32,842
I'm reminding you of your oath and duty
as a physician.

56
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:35,221
Okay, okay. Both of you,
back to your corners.

57
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:36,798
- She started this.
- Hah...

58
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:38,513
First things first.

59
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:41,553
No one else can know
that Lilly is Chloe's mother.

60
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:43,008
She doesn't need anyone else

61
00:03:43,097 --> 00:03:45,137
running her business
through the town gossip mill.

62
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:46,055
Agreed.

63
00:03:46,142 --> 00:03:50,902
Second, we need to talk some sense
into Lilly before Social Services arrives.

64
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:53,360
- I went out there to see her this morning.
- And?

65
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:56,025
I couldn't even get inside.

66
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:59,408
This is not the Lilly I know.

67
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:01,869
At her age, a... a secret pregnancy,

68
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,620
then abandoning her baby?

69
00:04:04,118 --> 00:04:05,698
Something's wrong with her.

70
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:08,619
She might have postpartum depression.

71
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:11,707
No, Lilly's never been depressed
a day in her life.

72
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:13,593
This is more than just being depressed.

73
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:16,760
It's a serious condition
that can happen after giving birth,

74
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,679
and it can appear without warning.

75
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:21,680
So, what are we gonna do about Chloe?

76
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:23,893
Well, I spoke to Social Services.

77
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:25,604
The way things stand,

78
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:29,392
Chloe will probably be placed
into temporary foster care,

79
00:04:29,477 --> 00:04:32,437
which means she will have foster parents.

80
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:34,010
Parents who could bond with her,

81
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:36,895
parents who would seek
to terminate Lilly's parental rights.

82
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:38,645
And once Chloe's in the system,

83
00:04:38,736 --> 00:04:40,856
it's gonna be tough
gettin' her back to Lilly.

84
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:42,527
- How much time do we have?
- Not much.

85
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:45,905
You know, the Social Services person
is gonna show up here this afternoon,

86
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:50,794
and with Lilly not cooperatin',
I mean, we have got ourselves a situation.

87
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:56,300
She has grown children.
Maybe one of them could take Chloe.

88
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:59,089
I think that's called kinship placement.
That could work.

89
00:04:59,173 --> 00:05:00,933
Well, before she slammed the door
in my face,

90
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:03,799
she said she did not want
to get her family involved.

91
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:05,255
Does she have a husband?

92
00:05:06,347 --> 00:05:09,727
- He died about... six months ago.
- Yeah.

93
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:16,571
So, she's isolated,
with limited social support.

94
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,990
That's not an ideal situation
for someone battling depression.

95
00:05:22,613 --> 00:05:23,703
I can talk to her.

96
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:25,871
Oh, please. I think you've done enough.

97
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:28,622
Well, I don't see you
coming up with any solutions.

98
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:31,623
- Well, I'm...
- What if I volunteer to foster Chloe?

99
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:35,338
- Until Lilly gets better.
- Anyone not directly related to Chloe

100
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:38,668
has got to be vetted,
and that could take weeks or months.

101
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:40,837
There's gotta be someone.

102
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:45,053
Well, the only people cleared to... to step
in are licensed healthcare providers,

103
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:47,636
and... and I don't know the first thing
about babies.

104
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:53,017
But I know a wonderful
healthcare provider.

105
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:03,695
I'm gonna check on Chloe.

106
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:11,155
What did you do that for?

107
00:06:11,245 --> 00:06:13,495
You need to rehire Mel, ASAP.

108
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:15,711
- Absolutely not.
- Why?

109
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:17,382
Because she defied you?

110
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:20,880
You need her help with Lilly,
and she's the only one fit to take Chloe.

111
00:06:20,963 --> 00:06:22,803
She was the one who quit first.

112
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:25,892
I mean, I... I suggest you find yourself
another solution.

113
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:29,058
If you turn down Mel's help,
and Lilly loses her baby,

114
00:06:29,138 --> 00:06:31,268
I'm going to blame you.

115
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:33,059
Now, Hope, ju...

116
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:34,558
Hope, don't...

117
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:47,410
What... what'd that wall ever do to you?

118
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:50,333
Nothin' that I know of.

119
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:51,698
You all right?

120
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:54,206
I'm good. I'm good.
We just gotta move this along.

121
00:06:54,288 --> 00:06:56,788
- What's the rush?
- We need Mel to stay.

122
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:58,173
We?

123
00:06:58,251 --> 00:06:59,501
Virgin River needs her.

124
00:07:00,294 --> 00:07:01,884
Doc isn't getting any younger.

125
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:04,553
Yeah, she's the hottest doctor
I think I have ever seen.

126
00:07:04,632 --> 00:07:08,012
Hey, hey. She's a nurse practitioner,
and you just be respectful.

127
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:09,854
And that windowsill is still crooked.

128
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:23,941
So, I, uh... I heard you found a baby
on Doc's doorstep.

129
00:07:24,026 --> 00:07:25,356
Oh, you did, did you?

130
00:07:28,197 --> 00:07:29,617
And where did you hear that?

131
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:32,239
My grandma.
She got a call from some lady on the PTA.

132
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:35,751
- Yeah, word travels fast around here.
- Yeah.

133
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:40,210
I... I had to sit through a lecture
about being a gentleman with the ladies.

134
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:41,453
Your grandmother has a point.

135
00:07:41,502 --> 00:07:43,802
I hope you're smart enough
to stay out of trouble.

136
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:45,893
Can we go on talkin' about the hot doctor?

137
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:47,633
Hey. What'd I say about being respectful?

138
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:50,717
Okay. I'm sorry, but respectfully,
you know, she's extremely...

139
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:51,803
Okay.

140
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:53,888
- I'm gonna head back to the bar.
- Okay.

141
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:55,813
- I, uh... I got this.
- All right.

142
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:17,913
Hey.

143
00:08:19,373 --> 00:08:20,673
You look serious.

144
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:22,877
And you look sweaty.

145
00:08:23,377 --> 00:08:24,747
I was helping out a friend.

146
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:30,893
- So, where's Chloe?
- Uh, Paige volunteered to watch her.

147
00:08:31,802 --> 00:08:33,222
She eating any better?

148
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,103
No. She hates the bottle,

149
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:37,891
and she's barely eating enough
to keep up her weight,

150
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:39,555
which means she's hungry and cranky.

151
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:41,154
Well, how are you holdin' up?

152
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:44,069
I mean, between Chloe and work,
you must be exhausted.

153
00:08:44,982 --> 00:08:47,782
Yeah. Well, no work today,
'cause I got fired yesterday.

154
00:08:48,152 --> 00:08:50,662
- Why?
- Well, he refused to call Social Services,

155
00:08:50,738 --> 00:08:51,738
so I did.

156
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:55,277
Well, for the record,
I think you were right to do what you did.

157
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:57,369
Thank you.

158
00:08:58,287 --> 00:09:00,157
You want me to talk to Doc for you?

159
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:02,118
No. No, no, no. This is my problem.

160
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:04,786
Thank you for offering, though.

161
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:06,378
Sure.

162
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:08,665
Have you eaten?

163
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:11,256
- No, I'm not hungry.
- No, come on. You gotta eat.

164
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:14,302
Well, I have to go pick up Chloe
from Paige, so...

165
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:17,215
Okay. Then why don't I fix some food,
and we'll take it to go?

166
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:19,866
A little fresh air will be good
for both your appetites, I think.

167
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:21,192
- Fresh air?
- Yeah.

168
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:24,979
- Ah. Where is this fresh air, exactly?
- Well, you'll see when we get there.

169
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:29,529
Ah... Jack, I'm not really up
for surprises today.

170
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:32,364
I'm gonna pick you and Chloe up
from your place in an hour.

171
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:34,447
Uh...

172
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:41,620
Come on, this is good stuff.

173
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:43,498
Yeah, it is.

174
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,884
Just a little more. Just a little more.

175
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:48,628
Come on.

176
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:51,971
Just a little more.

177
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:54,433
A little more, baby.

178
00:09:59,473 --> 00:10:01,313
oh!

179
00:10:01,892 --> 00:10:02,812
Oh, my...

180
00:10:02,893 --> 00:10:05,063
Wait a minute. Where's my epidural?

181
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:06,306
You said you didn't want one.

182
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:08,437
- I... I changed my mind. I need it.
- Shh...

183
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:10,614
- You, of all people, know it's too late.
- What?

184
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:11,693
What?

185
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:13,777
Have you ever been in labor?

186
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:16,085
Somebody needs to get me some painkillers.

187
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:18,275
No, sweetheart,
you wanted a natural birth.

188
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:20,037
- Oh, screw natural. Come on.
- Uh...

189
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:21,559
We're beyond the point of no return.

190
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,251
- The baby's head is crowning.
- What?

191
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:25,541
- We have to do this old-school, okay?
- No.

192
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,785
- We?
- You. You are amazing.

193
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:29,229
- Okay? You are.
- I'm not amazing.

194
00:10:29,253 --> 00:10:31,923
I'm trying to squeeze a watermelon
out of me without any drugs.

195
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:34,756
- Okay. Listen to me.
- This is your fault.

196
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:36,682
And I'm very sorry, okay?

197
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:39,061
Mom, one last good push.

198
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:40,282
- You got this.
- Ready?

199
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:41,386
You got it, Mel.

200
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:02,859
You didn't call me back.

201
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:05,542
- I was worried.
- I'm fine.

202
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:07,752
Well, you sound stressed.

203
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,590
Why don't you come home?

204
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:14,920
Uh... There was, um...
a complication with the baby,

205
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:18,257
and I'm... I'm thinking of becoming
her temporary caregiver.

206
00:11:18,969 --> 00:11:20,179
As in fostering?

207
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,680
- Yeah.
- That's a horrible idea.

208
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:24,725
Wow! Okay, don't...
don't beat around the bush.

209
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:26,139
No, I am serious.

210
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:29,557
Taking on someone else's baby would be
a huge mistake at this point in your life.

211
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:32,437
And what point am I at, exactly?

212
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:34,125
You're obviously
not thinking rationally.

213
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:35,992
You don't know what I'm thinking.

214
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:38,700
You're right, I don't.
But I know that a baby is not the answer.

215
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:40,323
It's...

216
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:43,203
I'm the only one
that can keep her in Virgin River.

217
00:11:43,285 --> 00:11:45,405
No, it is not your responsibility, okay?

218
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:47,036
You need to take care of yourself.

219
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:49,964
Joey, you don't understand.

220
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:53,302
Mel, I was there with you.
Start to finish.

221
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:55,969
I helped you pick up the pieces.
Don't you remember?

222
00:11:56,298 --> 00:11:57,968
Yeah. Yeah.

223
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:02,470
How could I possibly forget when you're
constantly reminding me how broken I am?

224
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:04,005
No, that is not what I'm saying.

225
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:06,698
- Yeah, it is. You just don't realize it.

Sweet thing.

234
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:44,596
Hi.

235
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:47,767
Oh, I thought Preacher
didn't allow you back here

236
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:50,440
since the Great Grease Fire of 2012.

237
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:52,689
It's peanut butter and jelly.

238
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:55,272
Oh, I always took you
for a roast beef kind of guy.

239
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:57,527
I'm taking Mel out to lunch by the river.

240
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,570
Pray that it works, because I need you

241
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:02,703
to counteract the calamity
Doc's created between the two of them.

242
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:04,202
Firing her didn't help things.

243
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:06,743
I'm working on mending that fence.

244
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:09,957
You focus on showing her
what Virgin River has to offer.

245
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:11,959
Gourmet peanut butter and jelly?

246
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:14,541
- Heaven help us.
- No, I've got chips and sodas.

247
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:16,087
Out of the kitchen.

248
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:18,630
Leave the food to me.
Leave the lunch to me.

249
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:22,835
You can't make important decisions
while eating peanut butter.

250
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:32,139
Lemon wedges go behind the bar.

251
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,520
If we put 'em here,
customers can help themselves

252
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:36,435
without havin' to ask us every time.

253
00:13:37,274 --> 00:13:40,404
You really think it's a good idea
for people to be puttin' their dirty hands

254
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:42,106
in the same bowl over and over?

255
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:45,675
Come on, man. What's your problem?
They're just lemons.

256
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:47,489
We got systems here, Brady.

257
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:49,583
And we're not about to change 'em

258
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:52,412
just because you're too lazy
to do things right.

259
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:13,807
Hey.

260
00:14:13,894 --> 00:14:15,354
When are we gonna flip pancakes?

261
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:17,727
Oh, it's a little late
in the day for that, sweetheart.

262
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:19,275
- Preacher promised.
- Hey, listen.

263
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:21,938
Buddy, as soon as
we finish this dessert order,

264
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:25,357
you and I, we will whip up
some pancakes, hm?

265
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:27,527
If it's okay with you.

266
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:30,736
It's fine,
if it's really okay with you.

267
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:33,328
- He just said it was.
- It is.

268
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:35,246
- Yes!
- Yes!

269
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:40,800
Oh, uh... by the way, I'm going to start
paying all the vendors by check.

270
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,680
So, I just need to know if you want me
to write the checks in your name

271
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:45,086
or the bakery's.

272
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:47,885
Uh... I prefer cash.

273
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:50,010
Well, yeah,
it's just that the, uh, accountant

274
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:52,427
has requested a more legitimate
paper trail.

275
00:14:52,516 --> 00:14:58,146
Okay. Well, what if you write
my weekly check out to yourself,

276
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,320
then cash it, then pay me that?

277
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:04,453
Yeah, I'm pretty sure our accountant
wouldn't consider that legitimate.

278
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:07,155
The thing is,
I don't have a checking account.

279
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:10,409
Well, that's okay. I can, um...
I can write the checks out to the bakery.

280
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:13,003
- The bakery doesn't either.
- Oh.

281
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:17,078
I've never worked with a business
that didn't... didn't have a bank account.

282
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:20,706
Well, I guess I just do things
a little different than everyone else.

283
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:22,632
Okay.

284
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:27,089
- Well, I'm sure we can work something out.
- Yeah. Can we talk about this later?

285
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:30,224
Yeah. Yeah, sure, if that's what you want.

286
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:31,314
- Okay.
- Okay.

287
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:35,181
Preacher? Honey, can you whip me up
a tuna melt real quick?

288
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:38,977
Yeah, sure, um... just as soon as I finish
up some business with Paige, yeah.

289
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:40,943
Oh, yeah, speaking of business.

290
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:44,403
Have either of you heard anything more
about that abandoned baby?

291
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:47,275
- Someone left their baby?
- No, honey, they didn't.

292
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:50,283
They sure did. I'm thinkin' it's gotta
be someone from out of town.

293
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:53,446
You know, I just can't see anyone
from Virgin River doing this.

294
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:56,405
You never know. People do crazy things
when they're desperate.

295
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:58,707
Well, I don't care.
It's unforgivable.

296
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:01,128
You know,
I actually have to get back to work.

297
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:03,750
- Come on, Chris, let's pack up.
- What about the pancakes?

298
00:16:03,837 --> 00:16:05,837
- We'll do it another time, sweetheart.
- Aww.

299
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:08,588
Thank you.

300
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:13,346
- Thanks, Preacher.
- Yeah.

301
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:14,430
See ya, Connie.

302
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:20,517
I will be right back with that tuna melt.

303
00:16:20,604 --> 00:16:21,984
Oh, thank you, honey.

304
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:25,404
Oh, and will you add a little extra cheese
for me while you're at it?

305
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:26,985
Okay.

306
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,280
Thanks.

307
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,490
- Hope.
- Ah.

308
00:16:34,576 --> 00:16:36,946
- How'd it go?
- This ought to do the trick.

309
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:39,247
Ooh. Thank you.

310
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:41,711
Keep Mel in town, we'll be square.

311
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:43,377
I'll do my best.

312
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:45,711
Oh... Ohh.

313
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:47,418
Ahem.

314
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:51,546
Hope, what's the 411 on that baby?
Did you find the mother?

315
00:16:51,635 --> 00:16:52,675
Still no word.

316
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:54,430
- No clues? Really?
- Mm.

317
00:16:54,888 --> 00:16:57,768
I'm thinkin' it's gotta be someone
from one of those pot farms.

318
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,100
What makes you say that?

319
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:00,944
Well, you can't hide a pregnancy.

320
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:04,018
I mean, if it was someone in our orbit,
we'd have heard about it.

321
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:06,436
- Mm.
- I'll give Mary Ellen another call.

322
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:08,565
She's got her sewin' circle
spreadin' the word.

323
00:17:08,652 --> 00:17:09,652
Mm.

324
00:17:14,658 --> 00:17:16,698
We need to get this Lilly thing resolved.

325
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:19,995
Connie's got everyone in Humboldt County
looking for Chloe's mother.

326
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:23,170
Well, she does have a knack of spreadin'
gossip, particularly when gossip

327
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,840
- is shrouded in altruism.
- Yeah.

328
00:17:24,918 --> 00:17:27,498
- Did you try speaking with Lilly again?
- Yeah.

329
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:30,298
And I know I don't have
a lot of experience treatin' postpartum,

330
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:31,682
but I gotta tell you,

331
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:34,339
- she is in bad, bad shape.
- Mm.

332
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:36,388
Well, you know who does have experience?

333
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:38,892
A midwife. If only we had one here.

334
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:42,064
Like it or not,

335
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:44,271
this is no longer a solo mission.

336
00:17:44,354 --> 00:17:47,364
You need help.
And you need to ask Mel for it.

337
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:49,821
She doesn't respect my authority.

338
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:54,779
She thinks for herself.
That used to be a quality you admired.

339
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:06,211
She looks so peaceful.

340
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:14,717
Man, what I wouldn't give
to feel half that relaxed.

341
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:20,352
Oh, what,
so this calm exterior is just an act?

342
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:24,390
No, I'd say it's more
of a well-rehearsed habit.

343
00:18:24,978 --> 00:18:25,978
Yeah.

344
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,690
I know it well.

345
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:30,861
In the ER,
you can't exhibit signs of stress,

346
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:33,073
'cause it freaks out the patients.

347
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:36,911
Finally, we get a peek
behind the curtain, huh?

348
00:18:37,991 --> 00:18:39,031
What does that mean?

349
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:41,867
Well, you seem so cool and collected.

350
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:43,828
Oh, I wouldn't say that.

351
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:45,952
Well, then you're confident.

352
00:18:45,999 --> 00:18:48,749
I definitely wouldn't say that.

353
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:49,882
Oh, come on.

354
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:53,842
What, you moved to a... a new town, alone,
in the middle of nowhere.

355
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:56,554
You immediately go head-to-head
with the world's crustiest boss.

356
00:18:57,719 --> 00:18:58,759
That's impressive.

357
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:04,176
Is that what you think of me?

358
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:06,394
Hm?

359
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:08,519
Impressive?

360
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:12,733
Yeah.

361
00:19:13,443 --> 00:19:14,443
Hm.

362
00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:19,533
Anyway, while we're being honest,
I can't take credit for lunch.

363
00:19:19,616 --> 00:19:20,776
This is all Hope.

364
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:24,198
- Aah! God, she is everywhere, isn't she?
- Yep.

365
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:27,671
You know, she told me about Lilly.

366
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:31,590
She shouldn't have done that.

367
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:33,964
Ah, she's... worried.

368
00:19:34,047 --> 00:19:36,217
No, Doc should not have told Hope.

369
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:38,135
Hope should not have told you.

370
00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:40,508
It's a violation
of patient confidentiality.

371
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:43,074
Well, she wasn't gossiping.
She's just trying to help.

372
00:19:43,098 --> 00:19:46,638
No, I know, but it doesn't matter why.
She's still crossing a line doing that.

373
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,520
Mm.

374
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:55,032
You know, I'm thinking of becoming
Chloe's temporary guardian.

375
00:19:58,363 --> 00:19:59,663
- Whoa.
- Yeah.

376
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:06,911
It's just the only chance I think she has
of staying in town.

377
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:09,369
That's a big responsibility.

378
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:11,167
I know.

379
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:16,756
I really had no idea
what this job was gonna be like.

380
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:20,049
Well, sometimes those turn out
to be the best jobs.

381
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:22,762
You think?

382
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,056
Yeah.

383
00:20:25,515 --> 00:20:28,225
When I signed up for the Marines at 18,

384
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,600
whew!

385
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:31,902
I had no clue.

386
00:20:32,522 --> 00:20:33,522
Now, it's...

387
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:37,435
...part of my DNA.

388
00:20:40,447 --> 00:20:41,617
Yeah, well...

389
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:48,122
I don't think that, uh, Virgin River
is ever gonna be a part of my DNA.

390
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:50,995
Well, never say never.

391
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:56,126
I think never is the most likely choice.

392
00:21:08,475 --> 00:21:10,935
So, just come back in ten minutes.

393
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,060
I'll be right back.

394
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:15,936
Give you guys some time.

395
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:17,361

- I want my baby.

00:22:26,636 --> 00:22:28,676
I know, sweetheart. I want her too.

419
00:22:29,222 --> 00:22:30,772

00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:33,943

00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:49,026
You don't know me very well.

425
00:22:50,118 --> 00:22:52,118
I know you fight for what you believe in.

426
00:22:54,956 --> 00:22:57,036
And if Chloe gets sent to Social Services,

427
00:22:57,125 --> 00:22:59,745
I know you'll find another way
to help her and Lilly.

428
00:22:59,836 --> 00:23:01,246
And you know how I know that?

429
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,760
- Shh, shh, shh.
- You are relentless

430
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,840
- when it comes to helping people.
- It's okay. It's okay.

431
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:08,719
Okay.

432
00:23:09,596 --> 00:23:10,676
It's okay.

433
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:17,399
Wow, would you look at that?

434
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:23,610
Incredible.

435
00:23:24,194 --> 00:23:25,824
Mmm... Like I said...

436
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:28,946
never say never.

437
00:23:48,176 --> 00:23:49,546
...what I'm asking...

438
00:23:49,636 --> 00:23:52,846
I didn't ask you to do this
just to be, you know, asking.

439
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:56,887
Ahem. What's going on?

440
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:59,940
Doc has something
he wants to... to say to you.

441
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:02,565
Right?

442
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:05,860
Yes?

443
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:09,032
- Vernon Edwin Mullins, speak.
- Ahem.

444
00:24:09,364 --> 00:24:14,794
It... it's just unusual, uh,
that I get, uh... served up a situation

445
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:16,710
where I can't solve the problem.

446
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:22,749
And this thing with Lilly's depression,
just... it's... it's a tough nut to crack.

447
00:24:26,047 --> 00:24:28,427
I'm happy to go talk to her,
if that's what you're asking.

448
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:31,434
Well, I don't see how you
could make it any worse.

449
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:35,929
You know, I don't need your approval.

450
00:24:36,016 --> 00:24:37,386
If you'd just listened to me,

451
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:40,476
Social Services wouldn't be
on the way here to pick up Lilly's baby.

452
00:24:41,062 --> 00:24:43,772
I'm never going to apologize
for doing my job.

453
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:44,857
No, of course you won't,

454
00:24:44,941 --> 00:24:46,991
'cause you don't understand
that in Virgin River,

455
00:24:47,068 --> 00:24:49,068
we believe our job
is to take care of each other.

456
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:50,704
Not just ourselves.

457
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:53,580
Whoa! Hey... Let's just remember
why we're all here.

458
00:24:54,409 --> 00:24:56,409
We all want what's best for Lilly.

459
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:01,710
Jack, can you drive us to Lilly's so...

460
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:04,627
Doc can stay behind
to meet Social Services?

461
00:25:04,711 --> 00:25:06,381
Sure. Come on.

462
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:08,263
You can ride shotgun.

463
00:25:08,965 --> 00:25:11,965
Do... Well, shouldn't Mel stay behind?
She's the one who called.

464
00:25:12,052 --> 00:25:15,392
Vernon, so help me,
you are jangling my last nerve.

465
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:17,522
For once, just do as you're asked.

466
00:25:34,282 --> 00:25:35,532
Oh...

467
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:42,670
I can't talk right now.

468
00:25:42,749 --> 00:25:44,789
Listen, I get it. Okay?

469
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:48,046
You're feeling alone and ashamed.

470
00:25:48,129 --> 00:25:49,589
I left my baby.

471
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:51,973
Lilly, you're experiencing
a hormonal imbalance.

472
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:54,640
It has nothing to do with whether or not
you're a good mother.

473
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:57,599
I think you have postpartum depression.

474
00:25:58,682 --> 00:26:00,772
It can alter your perception of reality.

475
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:04,404
But the good news is that it's treatable.

476
00:26:05,772 --> 00:26:06,772
No. J...

477
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:09,781
She's better off with someone else.
A good person.

478
00:26:09,859 --> 00:26:12,779
- You are a good person, Lilly.
- I can't take care of her.

479
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:14,572
Okay?

480
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:17,485
I'm not a young woman anymore. And...

481
00:26:20,203 --> 00:26:21,583
...with Buck gone...

482
00:26:22,956 --> 00:26:24,706
the farm alone is too much for me.

483
00:26:28,378 --> 00:26:30,838
If that's the way you really feel,
then I understand.

484
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:35,094
But can you do something for me
before I go?

485
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:36,677
Oh...

486
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:46,153
- Oh, God.
- No, no...

487
00:26:46,229 --> 00:26:48,729
- The whole town know?
- It's just Hope and Jack.

488
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:52,110
I can't look them in the eye.
They must think I'm...

489
00:26:52,193 --> 00:26:55,913
No. They think that you're not feeling
well, and they're worried about you.

490
00:27:01,077 --> 00:27:02,537
What is it you want me to do?

491
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:07,707
If you're gonna give up your daughter,
just... spend a little time with her.

492
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:09,706
You're trying to trick me.

493
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:11,924
No. Honestly, I'm not trying to trick you.

494
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:17,719
It's just that this is gonna be
your last opportunity to say goodbye.

495
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:28,646
Come on.

496
00:27:43,286 --> 00:27:45,286
Hey, is something wrong with the pies?

497
00:27:45,538 --> 00:27:46,538
No.

498
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:51,126
No, not at all.
In fact, the strawberry is a big hit.

499
00:27:51,878 --> 00:27:53,378
- Oh.
- I just, um...

500
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:56,796
I just feel, you know,
badly about earlier,

501
00:27:56,883 --> 00:27:59,403
you know, with the whole, uh...
you know, the whole check thing.

502
00:27:59,427 --> 00:28:03,137
Oh, don't worry about it.
I mean, I'll figure something out.

503
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:06,563
If I have to, I'll find a third-party
vendor to run the checks through.

504
00:28:07,268 --> 00:28:11,478
Listen, Paige, if, um... if you're willing
to go through that much trouble,

505
00:28:11,564 --> 00:28:14,444
then it obviously, you know,
means a lot to you.

506
00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:17,145
So, we can keep things the way they are.

507
00:28:17,612 --> 00:28:18,702
You know, money-wise.

508
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:21,370
Really? I'd appreciate that.

509
00:28:21,449 --> 00:28:23,789
Hell, I don't trust banks either.

510
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:28,078
My mom always told me to keep some bills
under my mattress in case of emergency.

511
00:28:28,415 --> 00:28:31,035
Well, thank you for understanding.

512
00:28:34,796 --> 00:28:36,876
- So, we're good?
- Of course.

513
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:40,968
Preacher!

514
00:28:41,636 --> 00:28:43,556
Hey, little dude, hm?

515
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:44,930
Mm, mm!

516
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:49,057
Can I help in the kitchen
tomorrow morning?

517
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:51,354
Well, that is up to your mom.

518
00:28:52,272 --> 00:28:54,112
Sure, as long as he's no trouble for you.

519
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:55,610
I'm no trouble, right, Preach?

520
00:28:55,692 --> 00:28:58,282
Trouble?
An extra set of hands at the griddle?

521
00:28:58,361 --> 00:28:59,951
You would be doing me a favor.

522
00:29:00,655 --> 00:29:03,065
In fact, I think I could use some help
prepping right now.

523
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:04,778
Can I, Mom? Please?

524
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:08,197
Okay, but just for a little bit.

525
00:29:08,288 --> 00:29:09,458
- Yes!
- All right.

526
00:29:10,331 --> 00:29:11,331
Thanks.

527
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:14,497
Okay. I got your door!

528
00:29:15,211 --> 00:29:16,211
Go.

529
00:29:16,546 --> 00:29:20,256
On three. Ho, three. Mm! Oh.

530
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:22,434
All right, let's do this, Master Chef.

531
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:25,175
Mm!

532
00:29:27,974 --> 00:29:29,274
That's all...

533
00:29:30,226 --> 00:29:31,096
hers.

534
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:33,346
At one point, the boundary ran way back...

535
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,620
Lilly wants me to sit with her
and the baby.

536
00:29:38,651 --> 00:29:42,111
Why don't you two... take a walk,
give me some time?

537
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:44,717
- Well, I don't really wanna go too far.
- Jack knows the place.

538
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:47,303
- He'll... he'll keep you close.
- Yeah, we can just walk the farm.

539
00:29:47,327 --> 00:29:51,077
Standing around worrying isn't gonna
do anyone any good, including Lilly.

540
00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:52,164
Go.

541
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,042
It's no use fighting.

542
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:04,546
This is a pretty big farm for Lilly
to handle all by herself.

543
00:30:05,678 --> 00:30:08,348
Yeah.
It was a shame when Buck died.

544
00:30:08,431 --> 00:30:10,311
Most of the workers left, and I mean,

545
00:30:10,391 --> 00:30:12,891
everyone from town came out
and tried to help where they could,

546
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:14,147
but she put a stop to that.

547
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:17,189
Said she wasn't interested in charity.
So...

548
00:30:19,108 --> 00:30:21,358
I mean,
losing Buck just about destroyed her.

549
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:24,610
Farm life is hard.

550
00:30:24,697 --> 00:30:28,447
I mean, none of the kids wanted to stay,
and she was too proud to ask 'em to.

551
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:31,575
Yeah.

552
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:35,170
I can understand not wanting
to burden your family and friends.

553
00:30:36,543 --> 00:30:39,633
Well, I don't see helping someone
you love as...

554
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:41,919
an obligation.

555
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:44,876
I mean, to me it's an opportunity
to show gratitude, right?

556
00:30:44,968 --> 00:30:47,888
Well, yeah, but you know,
if you're the one that needs the help,

557
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:49,811
sometimes it can make you feel weak.

558
00:30:50,431 --> 00:30:51,851
True, but...

559
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:55,476
well, that's why family and friends
should be there

560
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:57,022
to help you get strong again.

561
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:03,185
Yeah. I guess I never looked at it
like that before.

562
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:11,582
I'd just hate to see her have any regrets,
you know?

563
00:31:14,831 --> 00:31:17,831
You know, my sister and I used to
have one of these when we were kids.

564
00:31:20,503 --> 00:31:21,503
Oh, yeah?

565
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:23,380
Yeah.

566
00:31:23,756 --> 00:31:25,126
You guys close growing up?

567
00:31:26,426 --> 00:31:28,426
Yeah. We were best friends.

568
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:33,679
We're still really close now,
but, you know...

569
00:31:33,766 --> 00:31:36,136
sometimes I feel like
she doesn't know who I am.

570
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:38,228
So, who are you?

571
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:43,612
You know what?
Most days I don't even know who I am.

572
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:46,449
It was my dream when I was younger
to be a vet.

573
00:31:46,529 --> 00:31:49,119
Have a big farmhouse
and fill it with kids.

574
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:55,083
Well, dreams are funny things.

575
00:31:57,248 --> 00:31:59,418
They can come true
when you least expect it.

576
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:09,719
We should go.

577
00:32:10,553 --> 00:32:11,553
Yeah?

578
00:32:17,685 --> 00:32:18,725
Are you coming?

579
00:32:19,562 --> 00:32:20,562
Yeah.

580
00:32:29,739 --> 00:32:32,159
I tried to get Lilly
to call one of her daughters,

581
00:32:32,241 --> 00:32:33,531
but she wouldn't budge.

582
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:37,620
And Doc called. He's on his way
with the lady from Social Services.

583
00:32:37,997 --> 00:32:39,957
Well, you want me to try talking to Lilly?

584
00:32:40,833 --> 00:32:42,463
No. I'm gonna try one more time.

585
00:32:45,171 --> 00:32:47,301
- Here.
- Oh, gosh, thanks, Jack.

586
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:11,071
Baby.

587
00:33:13,366 --> 00:33:15,116
You gotta get up and out of this room.

588
00:33:16,035 --> 00:33:17,195
Okay.

589
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:19,576
You promised me...

590
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:22,455
when I left this morning.

591
00:33:23,543 --> 00:33:24,593
You promised.

592
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:26,880
I wish I was dead.

593
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:28,380
Mel.

594
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:30,593
It's how I feel.

595
00:33:32,051 --> 00:33:33,971
You won't always feel this way.

596
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,140
I ca...

597
00:33:38,474 --> 00:33:40,854
I can't live without her.

598
00:33:40,935 --> 00:33:43,225
Hey, we're gonna get through this.

599
00:33:43,312 --> 00:33:45,112
- I won't get through this.
- Yeah. Yes.

600
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:46,319
- I won't.
- You...

601
00:33:47,066 --> 00:33:48,186
You're strong.

602
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:51,238
- I'm not strong anymore.
- Yes, you are. You're strong.

603
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:53,029
Hey.

604
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:02,293
- It's my baby.
- You can do this.

605
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:21,354
There's nothing more to say.

606
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:26,358
- Lilly...
- Please. Please. I'm... I'm so tired.

607
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:28,940
I... I just want to be left alone.

608
00:34:34,363 --> 00:34:35,823
I lost my baby.

609
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:39,701
It was a few years ago.

610
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,500
And I was so excited.

611
00:34:46,459 --> 00:34:48,379
I'd always wanted to be a mother.

612
00:34:51,005 --> 00:34:52,295
But there was, um...

613
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:56,467
there was a complication during delivery,
and she was stillborn.

614
00:34:57,762 --> 00:34:59,852
There was nothing they could do.

615
00:35:01,015 --> 00:35:02,055
I'm really sorry.

616
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:05,477
But... why are you telling me this?

617
00:35:08,022 --> 00:35:10,192
After her death,
I couldn't get out of bed.

618
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:15,910
Like, it was days before
I could even sit upright.

619
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:20,578
I was just sad all the time.

620
00:35:21,494 --> 00:35:23,664
Something as simple
as brushing my teeth...

621
00:35:24,413 --> 00:35:26,043
would send me into hysterics.

622
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:30,668
I even thought about taking my own life.

623
00:35:33,005 --> 00:35:35,925
But eventually, my husband
dragged me to the doctor,

624
00:35:36,008 --> 00:35:40,558
and she told me
that what I had wasn't just grief.

625
00:35:41,264 --> 00:35:42,894
It was postpartum depression.

626
00:35:44,183 --> 00:35:45,393
So, you understand.

627
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:47,307
I do understand.

628
00:35:50,439 --> 00:35:54,319
But... with therapy and medication,

629
00:35:55,695 --> 00:35:57,655
I started feeling like myself again.

630
00:35:58,948 --> 00:35:59,948
I was still...

631
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:02,622
heartbroken...

632
00:36:03,786 --> 00:36:04,946
over losing my baby,

633
00:36:05,037 --> 00:36:07,867
but that sadness
was no longer controlling me.

634
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:12,126
It's too late. They're taking her away.

635
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:13,880
It's not too late.

636
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:16,968
I'm a certified caregiver.

637
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:22,641
So, if you want, Social Services
will allow me to look after Chloe

638
00:36:22,722 --> 00:36:24,352
until you can get back up on your feet.

639
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:25,312
And that way,

640
00:36:25,391 --> 00:36:28,521
- she doesn't have to leave Virgin River.
- No. I don't know. It's too much.

641
00:36:29,562 --> 00:36:30,812
You barely know me.

642
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:36,282
You know, someone just reminded me

643
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:40,105
the value in accepting help
when it's offered.

644
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:45,244
What if when I'm better, um...

645
00:36:46,495 --> 00:36:48,075
I still can't take care of her?

646
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:53,343
I'm sure the town would love
nothing more than to help you and Chloe.

647
00:36:58,049 --> 00:36:59,089
Oh...

648
00:37:00,134 --> 00:37:01,514
Just think about it, okay?

649
00:37:17,026 --> 00:37:18,666
They've been in there a long time.

650
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:25,326
Sure would be nice if I could read lips.

651
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:26,739
Hope. Get away.

652
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:29,107
What do you think they're saying?

653
00:37:29,163 --> 00:37:32,333
Look, I don't like eavesdropping
on other people's private affairs.

654
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:34,876
Oh, you're about as helpful
as tits on a bull.

655
00:37:39,382 --> 00:37:40,972
What did you and Lilly discuss?

656
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:43,800
Though it pains me to say it,

657
00:37:43,886 --> 00:37:45,716
I'm gonna have to side with Doc
on this one.

658
00:37:45,805 --> 00:37:47,765
I think Lilly deserves her privacy.

659
00:37:47,848 --> 00:37:49,058
Hah!

660
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:53,598
- Well, don't look at me.
- The suspense is killing me.

661
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:55,148
Oh, I'm not that lucky.

662
00:37:55,231 --> 00:37:58,441
You know, whatever decision Lilly makes,
she's gonna need our support.

663
00:37:58,526 --> 00:38:00,486
She's gonna need medical help
either way.

664
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:04,526
Yeah, leaving her depression untreated
can be dangerous.

665
00:38:05,741 --> 00:38:07,621
I'll personally make sure
she's looked after.

666
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:09,912
I'll second that.

667
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:12,955
Oh. Um... Could you come sit
with Terry and me?

668
00:38:17,211 --> 00:38:18,591
Have a seat, you guys.

669
00:38:19,672 --> 00:38:21,382
Hi, just have a seat, Doc.

670
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:23,133
Hey.

671
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:26,011
Okay.

672
00:38:26,345 --> 00:38:27,345
Um...

673
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:28,930
Uh...

674
00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:31,887
Lilly and I have talked at length.

675
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:34,730
We have determined
what the next step should be.

676
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:39,066
Uh... But first, I... I just wanna
thank all of you for everything.

677
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:44,240
Lilly, I've known you for over 20 years.
We're family, and family helps family.

678
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:47,491
And I'm... I'm really,
truly grateful for that, Hope.

679
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:50,872
And you've just been so kind to me.

680
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:54,499
But I... I can't ask you
to be Chloe's guardian.

681
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:58,293
We're here to support you,
whatever decision you make.

682
00:38:58,377 --> 00:39:01,707
Good. Good. Because you've inspired me

683
00:39:01,797 --> 00:39:04,467
to be strong
when I didn't think I had it in me.

684
00:39:05,051 --> 00:39:07,141
So, I called my daughter, Tara.

685
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:09,010
And... um...

686
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:10,927
I spoke to Tara on the phone.

687
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:16,229
And as she is a direct relation,
I have agreed to a kinship placement.

688
00:39:16,312 --> 00:39:18,152
She can assume the role of caregiver

689
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:21,980
until Lilly is ready to be assessed
for reunification.

690
00:39:22,276 --> 00:39:25,946
And Tara's gonna be here by nightfall
to take guardianship of Chloe.

691
00:39:26,864 --> 00:39:30,664
We will make sure
that Lilly gets all the help she needs.

692
00:39:30,743 --> 00:39:35,253
And... and Mel is extremely qualified
in this area.

693
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:41,630
Okay. Well, if you'll excuse me,
I need to call the office.

694
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:43,012
Oh!

695
00:39:43,255 --> 00:39:44,915
Um... Do you mind if I have a moment

696
00:39:45,007 --> 00:39:46,207
- alone with Mel, just...
- No.

697
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:48,215
Okay.

698
00:39:48,302 --> 00:39:49,432
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

699
00:39:52,181 --> 00:39:54,351
- Oh, Lilly.
- Yeah.

700
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:55,600
Oh!

701
00:39:55,976 --> 00:39:57,396
Thanks. All of you.

702
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:00,230
Um...

703
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:03,573
Wow.

704
00:40:04,151 --> 00:40:06,571
You were willing to take on
a stranger's child.

705
00:40:07,446 --> 00:40:10,696
If you could be that strong,
I decided I could pick up the phone.

706
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:15,452
And Tara, she didn't sound disappointed
in me at all.

707
00:40:15,871 --> 00:40:17,921
She sounded surprised...

708
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:22,593
and really excited
to meet her baby sister.

709
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:28,006
It took a lot of courage
to make that phone call.

710
00:40:29,635 --> 00:40:32,005
And don't worry,
I'll stay until Tara gets here.

711
00:40:32,304 --> 00:40:34,774
And I'll leave my number
so you can call me anytime you want.

712
00:40:35,224 --> 00:40:36,984
I honestly don't know how to thank you.

713
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:41,189
- You know what? Go see Doc tomorrow.
- Okay.

714
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:42,512
And I'll take good care of you.

715
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:45,065
Get you set up with a therapist
and some meds.

716
00:40:45,151 --> 00:40:46,401
A therapist?

717
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:49,107
There's a woman in Clear River,

718
00:40:49,196 --> 00:40:51,566
and she specializes
in this kind of depression.

719
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:56,004
Uh... someone wants
to join in the celebration.

720
00:41:04,253 --> 00:41:05,253
Hey, there.

721
00:41:05,504 --> 00:41:09,724
Um... I... I would love
to keep the name Chloe for her,

722
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,390
if that's all right with you.

723
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:14,969
- I love it. Yeah.
- Good.

724
00:41:15,055 --> 00:41:16,765
'Cause when she grows up,

725
00:41:16,849 --> 00:41:19,599
I can tell her that she got her name
from the nice nurse

726
00:41:19,685 --> 00:41:21,015
who helped her when I couldn't.

727
00:41:24,857 --> 00:41:25,897
Yes.

728
00:41:29,111 --> 00:41:30,111
Hey, there.

729
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,280
Hey, there.

730
00:41:34,033 --> 00:41:35,493
Sh, sh, sh, sh.

731
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:41,541
Oh, that's it.

732
00:41:58,265 --> 00:41:59,345
Unbelievable.

733
00:41:59,892 --> 00:42:02,192
- What?
- Don't "what" me.

734
00:42:02,269 --> 00:42:04,229
You know very well what.

735
00:42:04,313 --> 00:42:06,403
Uh, I assure you, I have no idea.

736
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:11,454
Not even a thank you for me sweet-talking
Mel into helping you with Lilly.

737
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:15,069
You know, when credit is due,
you are the first one in line.

738
00:42:15,157 --> 00:42:17,787
- Mel helped Lilly of her own accord.
- Exactly.

739
00:42:18,118 --> 00:42:21,578
That is exactly the reason
you should hire her back.

740
00:42:21,997 --> 00:42:24,497
Where else are you gonna find a qualified,

741
00:42:24,583 --> 00:42:27,463
kind-hearted nurse who's
willing to put up with you?

742
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:29,125
We don't see eye-to-eye.

743
00:42:30,172 --> 00:42:31,552
Maybe that's a good thing.

744
00:42:32,299 --> 00:42:33,839
We all have blind spots.

745
00:42:34,343 --> 00:42:37,893
It might be good to have someone around
who... who can see yours.

746
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:40,602
Boy, you are just...
You're not gonna give up, are you?

747
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:42,852
I don't have anywhere to be.

748
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:48,271
Okay. Fine. Fine. But the...
the trial period remains in effect.

749
00:42:48,357 --> 00:42:49,567
My name is still on the door.

750
00:42:50,484 --> 00:42:51,534
And, Hope...

751
00:42:53,028 --> 00:42:54,608
I do owe you a thank you.

752
00:42:55,197 --> 00:42:56,197
For what?

753
00:42:58,200 --> 00:42:59,200
For knowin' me.

754
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:02,044
Damned hard to admit I...

755
00:43:02,746 --> 00:43:04,416
I am slowin' down.

756
00:43:04,498 --> 00:43:07,168
Don't play the "old" card with me.

757
00:43:07,751 --> 00:43:11,091
You've been a stubborn old goat
since the day we met.

758
00:43:12,756 --> 00:43:15,216
The only thing slowing down around here
is this truck.

759
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:19,763
It's time to retire her and get yourself
something from this century.

760
00:43:40,034 --> 00:43:41,584
- Oh...
- Hope?

761
00:43:41,994 --> 00:43:43,124
Oh...

762
00:43:45,372 --> 00:43:46,372
Hope!

763
00:43:50,461 --> 00:43:51,501
- Are you all right?
- I...

764
00:43:52,004 --> 00:43:53,964
- I don't feel right.
- No?

765
00:43:54,048 --> 00:43:55,968
- No...
- Breathe. Breathe.

766
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:58,890
- That's it, just breathe.
- What's happening to me?

767
00:43:58,969 --> 00:44:00,929
Oh, you're gonna be fine.
You are gonna be fine.

768
00:44:01,013 --> 00:44:04,103
I'm gonna take care of you. Okay? Yeah.

769
00:44:06,685 --> 00:44:07,935
It's so quiet.

770
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:10,770
Well, lots of farmers
and ranchers around here.

771
00:44:10,856 --> 00:44:12,476
They tend to turn in early.

772
00:44:12,566 --> 00:44:13,976
Animals don't take days off.

773
00:44:14,401 --> 00:44:16,071
Yeah.

774
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:18,319
Whew.

775
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:24,243
Was a crazy couple of days, huh?

776
00:44:24,536 --> 00:44:26,406
Yeah, it wasn't what I was expecting.

777
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:31,210
So, what's gonna happen when the town
finds out that Lilly is Chloe's mother?

778
00:44:32,252 --> 00:44:34,632
Well, uh... Hope will handle the town.

779
00:44:35,464 --> 00:44:36,464
Oh.

780
00:44:37,883 --> 00:44:40,013
Yeah, so I guess it's not so bad

781
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:42,224
that she's in everybody's business
after all, huh?

782
00:44:42,304 --> 00:44:45,434
Well, when you're on Hope's good side,
she has a heart of gold.

783
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:47,100
Yeah.

784
00:44:52,856 --> 00:44:54,186
So, how are you feeling...

785
00:44:55,150 --> 00:44:56,360
after leaving Chloe?

786
00:44:56,694 --> 00:44:57,694
Mm...

787
00:44:59,488 --> 00:45:00,528
Yeah, I'm just...

788
00:45:01,865 --> 00:45:03,985
glad that she's where
she's supposed to be.

789
00:45:04,952 --> 00:45:05,952
Yeah.

790
00:45:06,954 --> 00:45:10,874
And thank you, by the way,
for all your help with Chloe and with me.

791
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:13,168
Oh, of course.

792
00:45:15,295 --> 00:45:18,505
You know, if, uh...
if you really wanna thank me,

793
00:45:20,175 --> 00:45:22,175
there is something
that you could do for me.

794
00:45:22,261 --> 00:45:23,641
Oh, yeah? What's that?

795
00:45:24,096 --> 00:45:25,256
Stay.

796
00:45:26,974 --> 00:45:27,974
Right.

797
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:31,850
And now you're gonna tell me
the town needs me... blah-la-la-la...

798
00:45:31,937 --> 00:45:33,767
No. Actually, I was not gonna say that.

799
00:45:33,856 --> 00:45:35,566
Oh, I'm so sorry.
What were you gonna say?

800
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:39,248
That I've gotten used
to havin' you around.

801
00:45:39,319 --> 00:45:40,699
Used to having me around.

802
00:45:40,779 --> 00:45:42,779
- Mm.
- Gosh, that is quite the compliment.

803
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:46,160
- Are you sure you wanna go that far?
- Well, you didn't let me finish.

804
00:45:46,243 --> 00:45:47,333
Oh, sorry.

805
00:45:48,162 --> 00:45:49,962
What I was going to say...

806
00:45:52,207 --> 00:45:55,497
- if you were to leave...
- ♪ Life is a mystery ♪

807
00:45:55,836 --> 00:45:56,876
...you'd be missed.

808
00:45:57,963 --> 00:46:01,053
♪ And joy it is to be ♪

809
00:46:01,675 --> 00:46:03,005
I don't know what to say.

810
00:46:05,012 --> 00:46:06,512
Just say you'll think about it.

811
00:46:07,681 --> 00:46:10,561
- Jack...
- Look, just consider it.

812
00:46:12,811 --> 00:46:14,351
Okay. I will think about it.

813
00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:16,646
Thanks.

814
00:46:19,109 --> 00:46:24,029
But there is one other thing
that I've been... dying to ask you.

815
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:26,953
Oh, okay.

816
00:46:28,869 --> 00:46:30,079
What's the story there?

817
00:46:33,749 --> 00:46:34,829
Uh...

818
00:46:38,045 --> 00:46:41,125
It's, uh... not something
that I'm ready to talk about.

819
00:46:44,343 --> 00:46:45,343
Not right now.

820
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:47,804
Okay.

821
00:46:49,181 --> 00:46:50,221
I understand.

822
00:46:51,683 --> 00:46:53,063
Jack.

823
00:46:56,396 --> 00:46:57,856
- Hey.
- Uh, hey.

824
00:46:58,774 --> 00:46:59,774
- Hey.
- Hm!

825
00:47:00,275 --> 00:47:03,105
Sorry. Hi. Uh, we haven't met.
I'm Charmaine.

826
00:47:03,195 --> 00:47:04,445
I'm Jack's girlfriend.

827
00:47:08,492 --> 00:47:10,372
I'm sorry. I'm Mel.

828
00:47:10,702 --> 00:47:11,702
Hi.
