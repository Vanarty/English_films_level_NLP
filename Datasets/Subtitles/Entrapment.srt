<i>(phone ringing)</i>

2
00:05:39,713 --> 00:05:41,589
Hello?

3
00:05:41,673 --> 00:05:45,510
<i>(shouts) Ming!
Turn that stinking music down!</i>

4
00:05:45,593 --> 00:05:47,220
Oh, it's you!

5
00:05:47,304 --> 00:05:50,473
Where's my painting? I want my painting.

6
00:05:51,099 --> 00:05:54,978
In the mail? Well, that's original!

7
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:59,566
I have to say, I'm astonished
that you could do it!

8
00:05:59,649 --> 00:06:03,570
The climb! All that schlepping
at your tender age!

9
00:06:03,653 --> 00:06:07,282
Anyway, bad news.
The price for the goggles went up.

10
00:06:07,365 --> 00:06:11,077
The Rembrandt's
not gonna cover my expenses.

11
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:16,541
Under the circumstances,
40 million would be a bargain.

12
00:06:16,624 --> 00:06:22,881
I don't care how you get it.
Just make sure that you get it fast.

13
00:06:22,964 --> 00:06:26,301
Tick-tock... tick-tock.

14
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:41,566
- Morning, Mr Cruz.
- Morning.

15
00:06:53,411 --> 00:06:59,834
First you insure the art, only to watch it
get clipped a month after the client buys it.

16
00:06:59,918 --> 00:07:02,962
Well, it could become
part of our ad campaign.

17
00:07:03,046 --> 00:07:08,843
I'll remember that when I go upstairs to hear
about my new position in the Toledo office.

18
00:07:09,219 --> 00:07:11,971
I called you at 4.30 this morning.

19
00:07:12,972 --> 00:07:15,016
I was home in bed.

20
00:07:15,099 --> 00:07:17,519
- You didn't pick up.
- I didn't wanna pick up.

21
00:07:17,602 --> 00:07:19,687
You had company.

22
00:07:20,438 --> 00:07:23,441
- He came in the window.
- How romantic.

23
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:25,985
I think that's how he got in.

24
00:07:26,069 --> 00:07:30,573
This was 70 storeys up with smart-glass
windows at 400 pounds a pop.

25
00:07:30,657 --> 00:07:32,909
He rigged something.

26
00:07:35,036 --> 00:07:37,121
And I think it was...

27
00:07:38,498 --> 00:07:42,126
...telescoping bolts.
- And you know this how?

28
00:07:42,752 --> 00:07:44,837
Excuse me.

29
00:07:45,672 --> 00:07:48,633
<i>(woman speaks Chinese)</i>

30
00:07:48,716 --> 00:07:52,720
- You're showing off again.
- Let a thousand flowers bloom.

31
00:07:52,804 --> 00:07:55,223
- Chairman Mao.
- You got it.

32
00:07:56,641 --> 00:07:59,352
He left the window open when he came in.

33
00:07:59,435 --> 00:08:01,646
The draught blew over the flowers.

34
00:08:01,729 --> 00:08:05,191
I'll bet the bolts on that window
have fresh scratches.

35
00:08:05,275 --> 00:08:07,610
- And who do we like for this?
- Guess.

36
00:08:07,694 --> 00:08:09,320
Oh, gee. I wonder.

37
00:08:10,863 --> 00:08:12,949
Indulge me.

38
00:08:13,575 --> 00:08:15,577
Indulge you?

39
00:08:16,452 --> 00:08:19,789
- Bob, may I?
- Oh, yeah, sure. Go ahead.

40
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:26,045
Four weeks ago, when our client
bought the Rembrandt.

41
00:08:26,129 --> 00:08:28,548
- See anyone we know?
- No.

42
00:08:28,715 --> 00:08:31,426
No, and neither did anyone else.

43
00:08:36,597 --> 00:08:38,641
Now look again.

44
00:08:38,725 --> 00:08:42,228
You think he marked the buyer
at the auction house.

45
00:08:42,312 --> 00:08:44,939
- Right.
- Good work, Bob.

46
00:08:45,064 --> 00:08:50,862
- And let's not forget the calling card.
- Elvis has not left the building.

47
00:08:52,071 --> 00:08:54,032
This is classic Mac, Hector.

48
00:08:54,115 --> 00:08:59,329
In the five years I've known you, you've liked
MacDougal for half the cases we've worked.

49
00:08:59,412 --> 00:09:02,582
- He's the best.
- He's also 60 years old.

50
00:09:02,665 --> 00:09:07,545
He ain't Spiderman any more. He's a rich guy.
He doesn't have to steal a Rembrandt.

51
00:09:07,628 --> 00:09:09,922
You think he steals because he has to?

52
00:09:10,923 --> 00:09:13,009
Keep working.

53
00:09:33,905 --> 00:09:35,865
So you get in here at 7am...

54
00:09:35,948 --> 00:09:40,995
...you work until 10, eat lunch alone,
you have no friends at the office...

55
00:09:41,079 --> 00:09:45,249
- Wow, you've been paying attention.
- I'm worried about you.

56
00:09:46,209 --> 00:09:50,588
Maybe I like being alone.
Maybe I'm getting over someone.

57
00:09:50,671 --> 00:09:55,802
Well, they say nothing gets you over
the last one like the next one.

58
00:09:55,885 --> 00:09:59,639
Is this your way of asking me out,
Hector? Huh?

59
00:09:59,722 --> 00:10:02,809
Well, um... not if you're gonna say no.

60
00:10:05,895 --> 00:10:07,730
You may be right.

61
00:10:10,274 --> 00:10:14,403
- He was here this week.
- He flew back to London this morning?

62
00:10:14,487 --> 00:10:18,825
It might be worth sending someone
over there, see what he's up to.

63
00:10:20,993 --> 00:10:22,912
- I know this guy.
- Do you?

64
00:10:22,995 --> 00:10:23,663
Sure!

65
00:10:23,746 --> 00:10:28,251
Some years back, when I was at the Bureau,
we sent two guys after him.

66
00:10:28,334 --> 00:10:31,462
I know, I know. They disappeared.
I know the story.

67
00:10:31,546 --> 00:10:34,966
- And these were both good agents.
- They were both men.

68
00:10:35,049 --> 00:10:37,593
What do you have in mind for bait?

69
00:10:42,265 --> 00:10:45,726
- The one thing I know he wants.
- Why not the Mona Lisa?

70
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:47,895
Our guy likes a challenge.

71
00:10:49,063 --> 00:10:50,690
Come on.

72
00:10:51,566 --> 00:10:53,526
I want this back.

73
00:11:19,635 --> 00:11:21,721
Thank you, sir.

Never carry a gun, or you
might be tempted to use it.

84
00:13:56,542 --> 00:13:59,128
- Why are you here?
- To ask some questions.

85
00:13:59,211 --> 00:14:02,798
If I don't like your answers,
you're going out the window.

86
00:14:02,882 --> 00:14:07,136
- Why are you following me?
- I've got a proposition for you.

87
00:14:07,219 --> 00:14:11,640
- How do I know that you're not a cop?
- You'll just have to trust me.

88
00:14:11,724 --> 00:14:14,476
Rule number two:
Never trust a naked woman.

89
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:18,480
I had nothing to sleep in.
Somebody stole my luggage.

90
00:14:18,564 --> 00:14:20,608
Really? I'm shocked.

91
00:14:20,691 --> 00:14:23,986
It's amazing what gets stolen
these days. Your bags...

92
00:14:24,069 --> 00:14:25,404
That Rembrandt.

93
00:14:25,487 --> 00:14:26,697
Mm.

94
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:28,741
Indeed. That Rembrandt.

95
00:14:30,117 --> 00:14:33,454
- And this is your proposition?
- Yep.

96
00:14:33,537 --> 00:14:37,291
- I don't think it's for sale.
- It's not. I'm gonna steal it.

97
00:14:37,374 --> 00:14:41,170
From Bedford Palace?
It's rather well guarded.

98
00:14:41,253 --> 00:14:46,425
By its own random-access security code,
changed daily, to which I have the key.

99
00:14:46,508 --> 00:14:49,428
- Well, good for you.
- But I need your help.

100
00:14:49,511 --> 00:14:51,388
I can't get in and out.

101
00:14:51,472 --> 00:14:55,017
I've already got a buyer
who'll give me 40 million for it.

102
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:58,228
I have no reason to believe
a word you've told me.

103
00:14:58,312 --> 00:15:02,149
- But you want to.
- Why is that?

104
00:15:03,651 --> 00:15:05,819
Because you want the mask.

105
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:09,406
Mm.

106
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:12,034
First we try, then we trust.

107
00:15:12,117 --> 00:15:13,619
Meaning what?

108
00:15:13,702 --> 00:15:16,955
Meet me outside the hotel, 9am.
Preferably dressed.

109
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:21,668
- How do I know you'll be there?
- Oh, I'll be there. And I'm never late.

110
00:15:21,752 --> 00:15:24,004
- Not ever?
- Never.

111
00:15:24,088 --> 00:15:27,508
If I'm late... it's because I'm dead.

112
00:15:27,591 --> 00:15:29,468
Whose hotel? Yours or mine?

113
00:15:31,553 --> 00:15:34,014

00:15:56,370 --> 00:15:57,913
- Haas?
- Lovely fella.

119
00:15:57,996 --> 00:15:59,164
Very low-key.

120
00:15:59,248 --> 00:16:03,919
You tell him you want to buy a Qing vase.
The price is £200,000...

121
00:16:04,002 --> 00:16:06,922
...which, of course, you won't pay.
- Why not?

122
00:16:07,005 --> 00:16:10,759
Because you're going to steal it.
You are a thief, aren't you?

123
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:18,058
Take this card, which is fake.
As he turns to swipe it, you swipe the vase.

124
00:16:18,851 --> 00:16:20,435
OK.

125
00:16:20,686 --> 00:16:22,729
Enjoy. I'll be waiting.

126

- I don't know you.

132
00:16:54,344 --> 00:16:57,639
- Where's the money?
- Where's the vase?

133
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:14,865
- OK, show me the real one.
- No, trust me, babe.

134
00:17:14,948 --> 00:17:18,869
This is better than a real one. 200,000.

- What's that?
- It's a credit card.

00:17:23,874 --> 00:17:25,959
Yeah. And?

00:17:26,043 --> 00:17:27,794
I need the miles.

138
00:17:29,171 --> 00:17:32,966
What exactly... do you think this is?

139
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:37,346
- Harrods?
- No, I've never seen rats at Harrods.

How funny is this?

143
00:17:48,023 --> 00:17:51,485
I'm sorry.
I made a terrible mistake about the vase.

144
00:17:51,568 --> 00:17:52,694
Too right.

145
00:17:59,076 --> 00:18:01,161
Uh, yeah, I did.

146
00:18:21,848 --> 00:18:26,561
Time's running out.
You can still escape if you're quick.

147
00:18:26,645 --> 00:18:28,689
Now listen.

148
00:18:28,772 --> 00:18:30,399
- Where's the vase?
- I broke it.

149
00:18:30,482 --> 00:18:32,317
- What!
- I'm sorry...

150
00:18:46,331 --> 00:18:47,791
Oh, God!

151
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,168
God bless!

152
00:18:51,169 --> 00:18:53,839
The man had a knife.
What was I supposed to do?

153
00:18:53,922 --> 00:18:58,718
- You were supposed to get the damn vase!
- It was a cheap Victorian knockoff!

154
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:06,643
You missed the point of the entire exercise.

155
00:19:07,561 --> 00:19:09,646
No, I didn't.

00:20:17,547 --> 00:20:23,053
And someone stole five prototype superchips
worth $4 million each.

173
00:20:23,136 --> 00:20:27,015
And one of these chips
is inside your suitcase.

174
00:20:27,098 --> 00:20:29,476
- With hotel security.
- Yes.

175
00:20:29,559 --> 00:20:34,981
And one anonymous phone call,
from me, plus the photos...

176
00:20:35,065 --> 00:20:37,692
- What photos?
- Oh, yes.

177
00:20:38,568 --> 00:20:39,986
These.

178
00:20:41,988 --> 00:20:44,074
Who took?

179
00:20:48,328 --> 00:20:50,038
Hey!

180
00:20:50,121 --> 00:20:52,958
- This is entrapment!
- What?

181
00:20:53,041 --> 00:20:57,545
- This is called entrapment!
- Actually, it's called blackmail.

182
00:20:58,254 --> 00:20:59,756
Entrapment...

183
00:20:59,839 --> 00:21:03,385
...is what cops do to thieves.

184
00:21:04,469 --> 00:21:06,179
You coming?

185
00:21:25,657 --> 00:21:27,617
Almost there.

186
00:22:00,567 --> 00:22:03,153
No lock? No security?

187
00:22:03,236 --> 00:22:06,030
You're not casing the joint already, are you?

188
00:22:06,114 --> 00:22:08,199
This way.

189
00:22:09,742 --> 00:22:11,828
Oh, wow!

190
00:22:12,954 --> 00:22:15,081
Shall we?

191
00:22:23,298 --> 00:22:25,133
Oh, my God.

192
00:22:32,432 --> 00:22:35,643
- This is quite a collection.
- Thank you.

193
00:22:36,352 --> 00:22:38,605
Only contemporary art?

194
00:22:38,688 --> 00:22:42,734
- You sound surprised.
- No, it's just not what I expected.

195
00:22:42,817 --> 00:22:45,695
Where are the suits of armour
and crossed swords?

196
00:22:45,778 --> 00:22:48,448
Up in the attic. Whiskey?

197
00:22:48,531 --> 00:22:50,617
Sure. I'd love one.

198
00:22:52,076 --> 00:22:53,578
Wow!

199
00:22:55,622 --> 00:22:58,041
Is all this paid for?

200
00:22:58,124 --> 00:23:01,461
- With blood. Cheers.
- To the mask.

201
00:23:05,548 --> 00:23:09,761
- I'll show you to your room.
- Who else do you bring here?

202
00:23:10,678 --> 00:23:11,888
No-one.

203
00:23:12,847 --> 00:23:14,891
- That's sad.
- Why?

204
00:23:14,974 --> 00:23:18,895
Well, to have something like this
and not share it with anyone.

205
00:23:18,978 --> 00:23:23,483
I don't need to share it with anyone.
Most people buy art to show it off.

206
00:23:23,566 --> 00:23:25,777
I collect art for me.

207
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:27,946
Your room's this way.

208
00:23:33,284 --> 00:23:35,370
Good night, then.

209
00:23:35,703 --> 00:23:39,123
- But it's still early.
- Yes, we have an early start.

210
00:23:39,207 --> 00:23:41,292
But I'm not tired!

211
00:23:41,709 --> 00:23:44,003
<i>Where do you sleep?</i>

212
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:48,675
Why?

213
00:23:49,759 --> 00:23:51,886
Just in case I need anything.

214
00:23:54,973 --> 00:23:57,934
<i>- May I ask you something?
- Sure.</i>

215
00:23:58,059 --> 00:24:03,856
Has there ever been anyone you couldn't
manipulate, beguile, or seduce?

216
00:24:05,149 --> 00:24:06,192
No.

217
00:24:08,444 --> 00:24:10,947
Why, do I make you uneasy, Mac?

218
00:24:12,115 --> 00:24:14,575
No. No, not at all.

219
00:24:15,368 --> 00:24:22,166
In fact, I think now might be a good time
for you and I to, uh... discuss something.

220
00:24:22,542 --> 00:24:25,670
- Well, what do you have in mind?
- Uh...

221
00:24:26,295 --> 00:24:28,089
The rules.

222
00:24:28,172 --> 00:24:30,049
Oh! OK.

223
00:24:30,591 --> 00:24:34,887
In order for there to be
complete trust between thieves...

224
00:24:34,971 --> 00:24:37,807
...there can be nothing personal.

225
00:24:41,894 --> 00:24:45,189
A job is ajob. You do your part, I do mine.

226
00:24:45,857 --> 00:24:49,861
<i>If one of us thinks about something
other than the task at hand...</i>

227
00:24:49,944 --> 00:24:53,990
...we'll either both get caught,
or both get dead.

228
00:24:56,784 --> 00:24:58,995
Good night again.

229
00:25:15,011 --> 00:25:16,721
<i>(Mac) No...</i>

230
00:25:16,804 --> 00:25:19,474
Nope. No...

231
00:25:20,433 --> 00:25:23,060
No. No.

232
00:25:23,519 --> 00:25:24,729
Nope.

233
00:25:25,021 --> 00:25:27,773
- That's the way in.
- That's the lake.

234
00:25:27,857 --> 00:25:33,613
Yes, I know it's the lake, dear. The first duke
dug a tunnel as a back door for his mistress.

235
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:36,532
100 years later, they flooded the place.

236
00:25:36,616 --> 00:25:38,701
OK, so we go underwater.

237
00:25:39,118 --> 00:25:44,457
I go underwater. I steal the mask.
You get a finder's fee of 10º/...

238
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:48,044
<i>But I have the code to the mask case, dear.</i>

239
00:25:48,127 --> 00:25:50,796
Which you're now going to give to me.

240
00:25:52,381 --> 00:25:53,841
No!

241
00:25:56,636 --> 00:26:00,556
- Have you been wasting my time?
- Have you been wasting mine?

242
00:26:06,646 --> 00:26:09,315
I'll arrange your return to London.

243
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:14,654
I'm not who you think I am, Mac.

244
00:26:14,737 --> 00:26:17,031
I hope not, for your sake.

245
00:26:18,491 --> 00:26:20,534
I'm a thief.

246
00:26:20,618 --> 00:26:23,496
So you keep telling me.

247
00:26:25,122 --> 00:26:27,458
I stole the Rembrandt.

248
00:26:28,751 --> 00:26:33,839
- Mac, I stole the Rembrandt!
- And I painted the Sistine Chapel!

249
00:26:34,507 --> 00:26:36,759
Come on! Ask me how I did it!

250
00:26:36,842 --> 00:26:39,553
- How did you do it?
- I came in from the roof.

251
00:26:39,637 --> 00:26:44,183
I dropped 20 floors down
on a McNeal Descender.

252
00:26:44,809 --> 00:26:47,728
- You must be a hell of a climber.
- I am.

253
00:26:50,648 --> 00:26:52,316
Mm?

254
00:26:54,568 --> 00:26:57,029
<i>I am a hell of a climber!</i>

255
00:26:58,656 --> 00:27:04,370
I am... one... hell of a climber.

256
00:27:04,453 --> 00:27:06,914
But how did you get it out of there?

257
00:27:07,957 --> 00:27:09,625
Now that...

258
00:27:10,751 --> 00:27:12,586
...is the most...

259
00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:14,505
...beautiful part!

260
00:27:19,093 --> 00:27:20,553
- I mailed it.
- No!

261
00:27:21,178 --> 00:27:24,515
I put it down their own mail chute.

262
00:27:25,683 --> 00:27:28,436
Simple...

263
00:27:29,603 --> 00:27:32,189
...effective... safe.

264
00:27:32,273 --> 00:27:33,983
That's very clever.

265
00:27:34,066 --> 00:27:37,528
Nope. Not clever.

266
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:44,785
It was perfect!

267
00:27:45,578 --> 00:27:48,205
Absolutely unbelievable!

268
00:27:51,333 --> 00:27:54,837
<i>You're right. It is beautiful. Mm?</i>

269
00:27:55,921 --> 00:28:00,885
Did you know that Rembrandt lived
with his parents well into his forties?

270
00:28:01,635 --> 00:28:05,055
But of course you'd know that.
You're perfect.

271
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,143
How did you get that?

272
00:28:09,226 --> 00:28:13,105
Why rob the penthouse... when
the mailroom's on the ground floor?

273
00:28:15,149 --> 00:28:17,193
How did you know I took it?

274
00:28:17,276 --> 00:28:22,490
There's only a handful of people
who can make the equipment you used.

275
00:28:22,573 --> 00:28:24,241
And I know all of them.

276
00:28:24,325 --> 00:28:27,703
- Someone was expecting that.
- Obviously.

277
00:28:27,787 --> 00:28:31,332
- Mr Conrad Greene of Kuala Lumpur.
- Oh, God!

278
00:28:31,415 --> 00:28:37,546
What was it? A down payment?
A service this Mr Greene is providing?

279
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:39,924
Yeah, something like that.

280
00:28:41,967 --> 00:28:47,223
What could you possibly
want to steal in Malaysia?

281
00:28:47,306 --> 00:28:49,808
- Hm?
- A hundred million dollars.

282
00:28:52,269 --> 00:28:54,313
What's the job?

283
00:28:54,396 --> 00:28:57,316
Like the wise man said:

284
00:29:00,778 --> 00:29:03,906
First we try, then we trust.

285
00:29:19,338 --> 00:29:20,798
Ah, good morning.

286
00:29:20,881 --> 00:29:25,302
Wanna tell me why my Jaguar looks like
you drove it off a fuckin' cliff?

287
00:29:25,386 --> 00:29:27,972
Thibadeaux, I'm awfully sorry.

288
00:29:28,055 --> 00:29:33,185
- You owe me 140 G's.
- How about a $40 million Chinese mask?

289
00:29:33,269 --> 00:29:36,981
Is it turbocharged with a six-CD changer?

290
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:40,484
Did you get everything I need?

291
00:29:40,651 --> 00:29:45,739
- When we done, you buyin' me a new car.
- Agreed. Did you get the small pneumatics?

292
00:29:45,823 --> 00:29:50,202
Yeah, I got the small pneumatics.
You gotta be a damn elf to use 'em.

293
00:29:50,286 --> 00:29:52,162
- The det cord?
- It's in the van.

294
00:29:52,246 --> 00:29:58,168
That's some nasty shit. Don't mix it with
nothing else or you'll be all over the floor.

295
00:30:01,046 --> 00:30:05,342
- What the hell's this?
- IR thermo-camera, what you asked for.

296
00:30:05,426 --> 00:30:11,432
- I specifically said no liquid-plasma screen.
- That was specifically all I could get.

297
00:30:11,515 --> 00:30:14,393
How can I do this without the right tools?

298
00:30:14,476 --> 00:30:19,398
Gimme a break, man.
You think I go to K-Mart and get this shit?

299
00:30:19,481 --> 00:30:22,609
Figure out something. You always do.

300
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:27,281
- Where's the honey?
- In the loch, training.

301
00:30:28,073 --> 00:30:31,869
I told her I swim for an hour every day,
so she'll do it for two.

302
00:30:36,081 --> 00:30:39,334
So, when is it we do the dirty?

303
00:30:39,418 --> 00:30:42,463
Maybe we should wait a bit.

304
00:30:44,423 --> 00:30:46,842
She's got a biggerjob after this one.

305
00:30:46,925 --> 00:30:49,303
This is big enough, man.

306
00:30:50,137 --> 00:30:52,514
It's never big enough.

307
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:58,395
- You are keepin' this strictly business, right?
- Strictly.

308
00:31:00,939 --> 00:31:03,817
Have you ever bought a woman's dress?

309
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,946
It's for the job. For her.

310
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:10,365
I don't know her size.

311
00:31:10,657 --> 00:31:14,411
Well, I'd say she's probably a six, but...

312
00:31:14,495 --> 00:31:16,830
...she'd look real fine in a four.

313
00:31:16,914 --> 00:31:23,253
I had this girl, Tina. She said the dress made
the woman. I say the woman makes the dress.

314
00:31:23,337 --> 00:31:25,422
That's a lovely story.

315
00:31:25,714 --> 00:31:27,925
But could you get the dress?

316
00:31:28,008 --> 00:31:30,511
Mac, you're too old for this shit.

317
00:31:33,555 --> 00:31:36,475
This mask thing better be worth it.

318
00:31:36,558 --> 00:31:38,685
Oh, it is.

319
00:31:38,769 --> 00:31:41,230
<i>It better be worth it for me.</i>

320
00:32:32,656 --> 00:32:35,325
Our gear has arrived.

321
00:32:36,577 --> 00:32:37,911
Who brought it?

322
00:32:39,329 --> 00:32:40,872
Delivery man.

323
00:32:40,956 --> 00:32:47,546
- You order this stuff from a catalogue?
- No, I order it from someone I trust implicitly.

324
00:32:47,629 --> 00:32:50,674
There's lots more, if you're not too tired.

325
00:33:07,441 --> 00:33:10,610
Left a bit. Left a bit. What is it?

326
00:33:10,694 --> 00:33:13,405
- It's 15.
- Good. Now...

327
00:33:15,198 --> 00:33:18,869
Straight back, straight back.
Go on, take it out. Back.

328
00:33:18,952 --> 00:33:24,041
There you go. There.
Yeah, straight back now. Keep it taut. Taut!

329
00:33:24,124 --> 00:33:26,793
There. That's it. Ah, finally!

330
00:33:26,877 --> 00:33:28,295
Good. Well done.

331
00:33:33,842 --> 00:33:34,885
<i>(beep)</i>

332
00:33:41,683 --> 00:33:43,018
Three...

333
00:33:43,477 --> 00:33:44,644
...two...

334
00:33:44,728 --> 00:33:45,854
...one.

335
00:33:49,232 --> 00:33:52,194
- Five decibels.
- Still too loud.

336
00:33:55,947 --> 00:33:57,324
Set?

337
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,285
- One and...
- Bang.

338
00:34:00,368 --> 00:34:02,496
- Two and...
- Bang.

339
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:04,664
- Three and...
- Bang.

340
00:34:04,748 --> 00:34:06,917
Four and...

341
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,002
Oh, yeah. Bang.

342
00:34:09,294 --> 00:34:14,132
- The bangs must be with the clock's chimes!
- OK, I forgot, I forgot!

343
00:34:14,216 --> 00:34:15,592

00:34:20,097 --> 00:34:23,642
I'll watch the mask.
You keep your mind on your movement.

Reach!

347
00:34:24,976 --> 00:34:28,563
No, no, no! These are the lasers! Hm?

348
00:34:28,647 --> 00:34:33,401
I am your eyes. So you keep yours closed,
because you can't see. Mm?

349
00:34:33,485 --> 00:34:37,364
But I'll be watching
every move on our screen.

350
00:34:37,906 --> 00:34:41,868
Come on, move! You have three minutes
till the guard gets here!

351
00:34:43,203 --> 00:34:44,955
Up... Good!

352
00:34:45,872 --> 00:34:47,958
Better. Left leg. Left!

354
00:34:51,753 --> 00:34:52,963
I need a break!

355
00:34:53,046 --> 00:34:56,216
You'll get a break... when you get it right!

356
00:34:56,758 --> 00:34:57,884
Number one!

357
00:34:59,469 --> 00:35:00,804
Two and...

358
00:35:00,887 --> 00:35:02,097

00:35:10,939 --> 00:35:14,192
Well, what's this?
It's supposed to be one second!

362
00:35:14,276 --> 00:35:18,655
- You're supposed to open the valve full!
- I did open it full! Look, it's open!

363
00:35:18,738 --> 00:35:22,033
All right, very well! I'll rectify it later. Hm?

364
00:35:22,117 --> 00:35:23,451
Six.

365
00:35:24,077 --> 00:35:26,997
Lever. Seven. Drop.

366
00:35:27,330 --> 00:35:29,499

- Deflate.

367
00:35:30,083 --> 00:35:31,585
Well done!

368
00:35:32,127 --> 00:35:36,798
I did open it full, OK?
You can go over there and check.

369
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:44,097
Come on!

370
00:35:49,227 --> 00:35:51,563
Here...

371
00:35:51,646 --> 00:35:54,357
This is where I'm gonna enter into them.

372
00:35:54,441 --> 00:35:58,278
Then I'll come up through the first beam.
The hardest part.

373
00:35:58,361 --> 00:36:01,406
I'm just gonna... You see? Right here.

374
00:36:02,657 --> 00:36:07,329
Once I get under the first beam, I'll be fine.
So don't worry about me, OK?

375
00:36:07,412 --> 00:36:12,834
Once I have this on the computer, I can
visualise it. I can do this blindfolded now.

376
00:36:12,917 --> 00:36:13,960
Really?

377
00:36:20,508 --> 00:36:24,012
- Is this absolutely necessary?
- Yes.

378
00:36:24,596 --> 00:36:29,392
- Because you won't be able to see them...
- And you will. Right.

379
00:36:29,476 --> 00:36:31,561
Trust me.

380
00:38:45,528 --> 00:38:47,280
We're ready!

381
00:38:47,363 --> 00:38:49,741
I'll tell you when we're ready.

382
00:38:49,824 --> 00:38:53,661
You forgot the damn pressure switch,
didn't you?

383
00:38:54,912 --> 00:38:57,790
Jesus! You just can't help it, can you?

384
00:38:57,874 --> 00:39:02,629
- Help what?
- Being such a nasty son of a bitch.

385
00:39:02,712 --> 00:39:05,673
This is how it has to be.

386
00:39:06,132 --> 00:39:09,969
- But if you can't deal with it...
- Hey, Mac? Bullshit!

387
00:39:11,346 --> 00:39:15,099
You know what?
I think you're just afraid to be nice to me!

Open it.

I thought you were probably a six,
but would look very nice as a four.

It's beautiful.

Well, it comes out of your share.

I didn't get you anything.

399
00:40:22,417 --> 00:40:25,461
- Not necessary.
- No, no. I want to.

00:57:25,980 --> 00:57:28,899
- No, I need you for the job.
- There is no otherjob!

520
00:57:28,983 --> 00:57:31,027
There is! It's worth over...

521
00:57:33,571 --> 00:57:36,449
And don't tell me it's worth a hundred million.

522
00:57:36,532 --> 00:57:41,495
It's not. It's, it's... You're right, it's not.
It's worth over a billion.

523
00:57:51,380 --> 00:57:53,591
<i>(Gin gasps)</i>

524
00:57:56,135 --> 00:57:58,763
And that's just your share!

525
00:57:59,555 --> 00:58:01,640
I'm not lying!

526
00:58:06,937 --> 00:58:09,774
I can't do this job without you, Mac.

527
00:58:09,857 --> 00:58:13,027
Please come with me to Kuala Lumpur.

528
00:58:23,579 --> 00:58:26,123
Can you just decide soon, please?

529
00:58:31,712 --> 00:58:33,672
Four, three...

530
00:58:33,756 --> 00:58:35,883
...two, one.

531
00:58:36,592 --> 00:58:42,348
Your time's up. You said you would tell me
what the nextjob is in 24 hours.

532
00:58:42,932 --> 00:58:45,017
It's a bank.

533
00:58:47,144 --> 00:58:49,230
And?

534
00:58:49,605 --> 00:58:52,316
And I didn't say I'd tell you any more.

535
00:58:53,609 --> 00:58:55,778
Isn't it beautiful here?

536
00:59:06,372 --> 00:59:08,457
<i>(car horn)</i>

537
00:59:16,465 --> 00:59:19,468
Banks have never really been my thing.

538
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:23,138
Think a billion dollars and change your mind.

539
00:59:23,430 --> 00:59:27,810
- I just don't like surprises.
- Trust me, there won't be any.

540
00:59:28,310 --> 00:59:31,647
<i>Trust me. There always are surprises.</i>

541
00:59:49,373 --> 00:59:53,294
I must say, it's, uh... very homey.

542
00:59:53,377 --> 00:59:55,504
Why, thank you!

543
01:00:03,220 --> 01:00:05,764
Of course, when I said bank...

544
01:00:06,682 --> 01:00:09,310
...I didn't mean just any bank.

545
01:00:10,769 --> 01:00:12,605
A room with a view!

546
01:00:12,688 --> 01:00:17,359
- I give you the world's tallest building.
- And we're going to steal it?

547
01:00:17,443 --> 01:00:21,113
Home of the International Clearance Bank...

548
01:00:21,196 --> 01:00:27,453
...which I'm sure you know controls all big
money transactions in Southeast Asia.

549
01:00:28,412 --> 01:00:31,624
- Do I have your attention now?
- Undivided.

550
01:00:31,707 --> 01:00:37,296
Here, the headquarters of the International
Clearance Bank in New York.

551
01:00:37,379 --> 01:00:41,634
Running from there are hackproof,
firewalled, dedicated lines...

552
01:00:41,717 --> 01:00:45,220
...to computers in its branch offices
around the world.

553
01:00:45,304 --> 01:00:48,474
The only access is from
central control in New York...

554
01:00:48,557 --> 01:00:52,603
...or from the totally secure computers
in the branch offices.

555
01:00:52,686 --> 01:00:57,316
In Kuala Lumpur,
only one man has unlimited access.

556
01:00:57,399 --> 01:01:02,863
<i>Lee Kuan Hong, Chairman of the International
Clearance Bank of Kuala Lumpur.</i>

557
01:01:02,946 --> 01:01:08,619
Vaults are accessed by two things: a key code
and a completely unfakeable retinal scan.

558
01:01:09,453 --> 01:01:12,164
- Morning, everyone. Nice day, uh?
- Hi.

559
01:01:12,247 --> 01:01:14,416
Arghhh!

560
01:01:14,500 --> 01:01:16,543
Which we're gonna fake.

561
01:01:17,086 --> 01:01:20,547
<i>Right now, our Chairman,
with a face full of Mace...</i>

562
01:01:20,631 --> 01:01:22,925
<i>... is getting his eyes checked...</i>

563
01:01:23,008 --> 01:01:26,261
<i>... with a little help from
Conrad Greene's guys...</i>

564
01:01:26,345 --> 01:01:28,013
<i>... hopefully.</i>

565
01:01:28,972 --> 01:01:31,600
- With me so far?
- All the way.

566
01:01:31,683 --> 01:01:36,688
Now, because of the millennium bug,
our friends at International Clearance...

567
01:01:36,772 --> 01:01:41,819
...will be running integrity tests,
which they're rehearsing as we speak.

568
01:01:41,902 --> 01:01:46,824
<i>- Prepare test shutdown for Sydney in...
- Just before midnight, local time...</i>

569
01:01:46,907 --> 01:01:50,661
<i>... they'll shut down the mainframe
in each zone for 30 seconds.</i>

570
01:01:50,744 --> 01:01:53,831
- Sydney is shut down.
- Run test program.

571
01:01:53,914 --> 01:01:57,709
Now we need those 30 seconds
to patch into the mainframe.

572
01:01:57,793 --> 01:02:03,966
We then need ten seconds of one-on-one time
with the computer, to download...

573
01:02:04,049 --> 01:02:07,553
..."the stuff".
- How do we acquire those ten seconds?

574
01:02:07,636 --> 01:02:08,929
We steal 'em.

575
01:02:09,012 --> 01:02:14,935
<i>The transmitter I left behind simply overrides
the signal of the atomic clock. So...</i>

576
01:02:15,018 --> 01:02:20,357
...from 11pm tomorrow night their clocks gain
a fraction of a second every minute...

577
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:23,026
...and we gain our ten seconds.

578
01:02:23,110 --> 01:02:26,530
And what is this "stuff" we are downloading?

579
01:02:38,125 --> 01:02:40,043
Enya?

580
01:02:40,127 --> 01:02:44,590
Cunningly disguised in there is a disk
that took me five years to make...

581
01:02:44,673 --> 01:02:48,176
...cooped up in my broom closet
at Waverly Insurance.

582
01:02:48,260 --> 01:02:53,056
It tells the ICB computer to transfer
relatively small amounts of money...

583
01:02:53,140 --> 01:02:57,686
...from hundreds of corporations all over
Southeast Asia into my account.

584
01:02:57,769 --> 01:03:00,647
<i>- Our account.
- Yeah, our account.</i>

585
01:03:01,273 --> 01:03:04,067
Eight billion dollars in total.

586
01:03:04,902 --> 01:03:07,237
<i>You said one billion.</i>

587
01:03:07,321 --> 01:03:10,532
<i>Mm-mm. I said that was your share.</i>

588
01:03:10,616 --> 01:03:14,703
What can you do with seven billion
that you can't do with four?

589
01:03:16,163 --> 01:03:18,248
Hold the record.

590
01:03:18,916 --> 01:03:21,001
Alone.

591
01:03:21,585 --> 01:03:23,545
Sounds rather Ionely.

592
01:03:23,629 --> 01:03:25,589
Alone?

593
01:03:25,672 --> 01:03:27,633
No. Alone is good.

594
01:03:28,884 --> 01:03:31,386
- You want a beer?
- Thank you.

595
01:03:32,638 --> 01:03:36,016
- We'll need three weeks to prepare.
- What?

596
01:03:36,099 --> 01:03:40,145
- Minimum.
- No. It has to be tomorrow night.

597
01:03:40,562 --> 01:03:42,189
No way.

598
01:03:42,272 --> 01:03:46,652
You don't understand. It has to be
millennium midnight or it's never.

599
01:03:46,735 --> 01:03:49,321
Then it's never. It's impossible.

600
01:03:55,744 --> 01:03:57,871
You...

601
01:04:01,249 --> 01:04:03,960
OK. Fifty-fifty.

602
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:05,962
What?

603
01:04:07,631 --> 01:04:09,716
You heard.

604
01:04:12,260 --> 01:04:14,346
It's impossible.

605
01:04:16,932 --> 01:04:19,017
But doable.

606
01:04:47,003 --> 01:04:52,426
<i>(tour guide) Ladies and gentlemen, we are
now standing over 700ft above sea level.</i>

607
01:04:52,509 --> 01:04:56,138
Our skybridge is the longest
and highest in the world.

608
01:04:56,221 --> 01:04:59,933
It stretches over 300ft to the opposite tower.

609
01:05:00,016 --> 01:05:04,479
It is supported, as you can see,
by four flexible steel pillars.

610
01:05:04,563 --> 01:05:08,483
The lights are being hung
for our millennium party tomorrow.

611
01:05:08,567 --> 01:05:14,281
Over 40,000 light bulbs
will make this truly a sight to remember.

612
01:07:19,989 --> 01:07:25,537
So, what have we here? We have the goggles
with the chairman's retinal scan.

613
01:07:25,620 --> 01:07:29,999
And we have the chairman's
access card to the 86th floor...

614
01:07:31,876 --> 01:07:33,086
...in the bag.

615
01:07:33,169 --> 01:07:35,088
Anything else I need to know?

616
01:07:35,171 --> 01:07:39,634
Confucius, he say:
Don't use cannon to kill mosquito.

617
01:07:41,302 --> 01:07:43,263
Right!

618
01:07:43,346 --> 01:07:48,184
Well, now that I've shown you mine,
it's your turn to show me yours.

619
01:07:48,268 --> 01:07:52,939
- Well, here she is.
- Oh, goody, goody, goody!

620
01:07:53,022 --> 01:07:54,899
Bring it to Papa.

621
01:07:54,983 --> 01:07:59,404
Oh! A thing of beauty, huh? Ajoy forever!

622
01:08:00,780 --> 01:08:04,242
And where's the mask?
I want my mask. Come on!

623
01:08:04,951 --> 01:08:08,913
Oh! So you're working
with MacDougal on this, huh?

624
01:08:08,997 --> 01:08:10,123
Yeah.

625
01:08:10,206 --> 01:08:12,125
Uh-huh.

626
01:08:13,918 --> 01:08:15,295
Uh-huh.

627
01:08:15,628 --> 01:08:19,966
I would suggest that you have
a little tête-à-tête with your partner.

628
01:08:20,049 --> 01:08:22,302
If he's still in the country.

629
01:08:22,385 --> 01:08:26,347
In the meantime,
I'll hold on to the access card and goggles.

630
01:08:28,183 --> 01:08:32,604
Conrad, you've gotta believe me.
I had no idea.

631
01:08:32,687 --> 01:08:37,692
- I swear to God, I'd never do this to you!
- Don't! Don't pout at me, you little bitch!

632
01:08:37,775 --> 01:08:41,029
- Come on, Conrad.
- Get out of here! Get out!

633
01:08:41,112 --> 01:08:44,574
Get out! Just get out! Get outta here!

634
01:08:51,247 --> 01:08:53,583
<i>Baby, I'm glad to see you!</i>

635
01:08:54,375 --> 01:08:56,377
I'm calling it off.

636
01:08:56,461 --> 01:09:00,340
You take this.
I'll get the Rembrandt for you later.

637
01:09:00,423 --> 01:09:04,719
- What you sayin'
- She's over her head. It's not happening.

638
01:09:04,802 --> 01:09:08,806
What about the big, giant, huge job
you were all cute about in Scotland?

639
01:09:08,890 --> 01:09:12,727
Now you wouldn't be tryin'
to cut a brother out of anything?

640
01:09:12,810 --> 01:09:16,105
- There's nothing to cut you out of.
- Sit down, Mac.

641
01:09:16,189 --> 01:09:18,024
Sit down.

642
01:09:18,107 --> 01:09:21,486
I said, sit the fuck down.

643
01:09:30,370 --> 01:09:35,833
You know, Mac, I think it's time
to take your girlfriend out of the equation...

644
01:09:35,917 --> 01:09:40,713
...and get down to the you-and-me of it all.
- She's not my girlfriend.

645
01:09:40,797 --> 01:09:47,303
See, I'm gettin' this little Yoko vibe, like all of
a sudden your girlfriend's the one in control.

646
01:09:59,816 --> 01:10:04,862
Now, you change partners,
you change the rules.

647
01:10:04,946 --> 01:10:09,325
And the rules are... Mac does the job.

648
01:10:09,409 --> 01:10:11,494
I watch Mac's back.

649
01:10:11,577 --> 01:10:14,622
You don't call off nothin' unless I say so.

650
01:10:29,804 --> 01:10:32,306
Gin?

651
01:10:39,188 --> 01:10:41,274
Gin?

652
01:10:44,026 --> 01:10:47,530
Where is it, you bastard?! I trusted you!

653
01:10:49,031 --> 01:10:52,493
- You bastard! I trusted you! I trusted you!
- Gin! Hey! Gin!

654
01:10:52,577 --> 01:10:54,746
Where is it?!

655
01:11:01,836 --> 01:11:03,671
Why'd you take it?

656
01:11:04,630 --> 01:11:07,717
Get up! I know you're faking!

657
01:11:07,800 --> 01:11:08,718
Ohh!

658
01:11:13,764 --> 01:11:16,267
<i>(Gin sobs)</i>

659
01:11:38,581 --> 01:11:40,791
Where'd you go?

660
01:11:40,875 --> 01:11:44,837
- Why'd you take it?
- I was going to sell it.

661
01:11:45,087 --> 01:11:47,381
Then why didn't you?

662
01:11:48,507 --> 01:11:52,303
Because... I... couldn't do it.

663
01:11:53,012 --> 01:11:55,097
Why not?

664
01:11:56,432 --> 01:12:00,436
I knew that if I told you to forget this job...

665
01:12:00,519 --> 01:12:02,855
...get the hell outta here...

666
01:12:03,481 --> 01:12:06,609
...you wouldn't do it, would you?

667
01:12:06,692 --> 01:12:08,319
- Hm?
- No.

668
01:12:08,402 --> 01:12:10,321
Mm. Right.

669
01:12:16,327 --> 01:12:19,956
- Were you worried about me, Mac?
- Well, yes.

670
01:12:20,039 --> 01:12:23,417
- Were you?
- I was worried about both of us.

671
01:12:28,631 --> 01:12:31,092
- Don't be.
- Hm.

672
01:12:32,009 --> 01:12:35,763
Whoops, sorry. Forgot about the rules.

673
01:12:37,682 --> 01:12:39,642
Mm.

674
01:12:41,060 --> 01:12:43,604
Have you ever broken 'em, Mac?

675
01:12:44,063 --> 01:12:46,148
No.

676
01:12:46,399 --> 01:12:49,694
- Not once?
- No.

677
01:12:52,196 --> 01:12:54,115
Never?

678
01:12:54,365 --> 01:12:56,450
Never.

679
01:13:00,371 --> 01:13:03,082
Alone is... good, eh?

680
01:13:03,499 --> 01:13:05,584
No. Bullshit.

681
01:13:05,668 --> 01:13:08,462
I hate alone. Alone sucks.

682
01:13:08,587 --> 01:13:11,007
- Really?
- Yeah.

683
01:13:11,090 --> 01:13:12,967
Mm.

684
01:13:22,435 --> 01:13:24,854
Hey... Gin...

685
01:13:25,229 --> 01:13:26,605
Gin...

686
01:13:26,856 --> 01:13:28,524
Gin.

687

- What!

689
01:13:42,496 --> 01:13:44,874
My situation is...

690
01:13:45,708 --> 01:13:48,002
...so complicated...

691
01:13:48,085 --> 01:13:50,588

692
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:52,965

What are you doing here?

701
01:15:45,411 --> 01:15:49,498
Oh, I read in the newspapers
that the mask thing's gone down.

702
01:15:49,581 --> 01:15:53,168
I don't hear from my trusty agent,
so naturally I worry.

703
01:15:54,503 --> 01:15:58,507
I call the hospitals, I call the morgue...

704
01:15:59,049 --> 01:16:02,011
...and, finally, I call the airlines.

705
01:16:03,554 --> 01:16:08,308
I'm a man badly in need of news here,
Miss Baker. Help me out.

706
01:16:08,392 --> 01:16:13,814
You want news, Hector? The news is, I don't
appreciate you blowing my cover like this.

707
01:16:13,897 --> 01:16:18,736
He's planning ajob that's
gonna make the mask look like...

708
01:16:19,820 --> 01:16:25,367
You don't believe me? Fine.
Then pull me in and pick him up.

709
01:16:25,451 --> 01:16:30,164
Why would I pull you in when you
seem to be getting so close to Mac?

710
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:36,628
Oh, jeez!

711
01:16:36,920 --> 01:16:39,923
- This was business, Hector!
- Business...

712
01:16:40,007 --> 01:16:43,510
Are you sure there's nothing else
you wanna tell me?

713
01:16:43,594 --> 01:16:48,891
Look, give me until tomorrow.
I promise you, you'll have it all.

714
01:16:51,518 --> 01:16:53,604

715
01:17:00,110 --> 01:17:02,196
Don't lose her.

716
01:17:06,867 --> 01:17:12,039
Guess she didn't appreciate my pictures.
Did I tell you, or did I tell you?

717
01:17:12,122 --> 01:17:16,376
- She's screwin' you both, man.
- She says it's business. I believe her.

718
01:17:16,460 --> 01:17:20,923
Yeah, she's probably on her way to Mr Mac
right now to do a little "business".

719
01:17:21,006 --> 01:17:25,385
Don't do that. You do not do that!
You do not speak like that! You do not!

720
01:17:25,469 --> 01:17:29,932
Hector, baby! There ain't no need
to get all up and hard, my man!

721
01:17:30,057 --> 01:17:33,644
Now I said I'd make this trip
worth your while.

722
01:17:33,769 --> 01:17:36,063
You better be right.

723
01:17:37,815 --> 01:17:41,360
All you gotta do is listen to old Thibadeaux.

724

727
01:18:02,464 --> 01:18:05,384
OK. The dish should be coming on-line.

728
01:18:05,467 --> 01:18:09,555
Every minute, from now to midnight,
we steal a tenth of a second...

731
01:18:20,148 --> 01:18:23,068

So, this is your international art thief,
Mr Cruz?

750
01:21:30,171 --> 01:21:33,550
He doesn't look very dangerous, does he?

751

Not yet.

Excuse me.

- 70th floor, sir.

758
01:22:11,921 --> 01:22:16,092
- Watching the fireworks, probably.
- Do you have cameras up there?

- Of course.
- Would you mind?

760

Mmm.

- What do you mean?

762
01:22:36,780 --> 01:22:39,282
Sir, I... I just can't find them.

763
01:22:39,366 --> 01:22:42,118
There are 2,000 cameras in this building!
Find them!

Listen, I don't mean to intrude,
but these people are very, very smart.

765
01:22:48,083 --> 01:22:52,712
If they've disappeared, it's because they
mean to. Is there any art in this building?

766
01:22:52,796 --> 01:22:54,047
Some.

767
01:22:54,130 --> 01:22:59,094
- And the Bank Clearance House?
- Nothing but a big computer.

01:32:14,440 --> 01:32:18,318
Now, if we can get across the vent shaft,
we should be OK.

862
01:32:18,402 --> 01:32:19,862
Across where?

863
01:32:21,613 --> 01:32:23,323
There.

<i>(helicopter)</i>

870
01:33:06,575 --> 01:33:08,785
OK.

871
01:33:21,965 --> 01:33:23,258
Move it!

872

873
01:33:42,861 --> 01:33:44,655
Keep moving!

874
01:33:45,364 --> 01:33:46,990
Come on!

875
01:33:59,086 --> 01:34:00,545

Gin! Watch out!

880
01:34:38,375 --> 01:34:41,336
Gin! We're nearly there! Move it!

881
01:34:42,295 --> 01:34:43,672
Come on!

882
01:35:05,819 --> 01:35:07,863
Oh, God!

883
01:35:07,946 --> 01:35:10,031
<i>(crowd gasps)</i>

884
01:35:18,165 --> 01:35:20,459
Next stop, vent shaft.

885
01:36:04,294 --> 01:36:08,340
<i>(megaphone) Armed police!

887
01:36:13,762 --> 01:36:15,597
<i>SWAT team to the roof.</i>

888
01:36:15,680 --> 01:36:17,766
Let's go, let's go!

889
01:36:18,016 --> 01:36:19,809
Move, move, move!

890
01:36:20,185 --> 01:36:24,272
If you can't feel alive now, you never will.

891
01:36:26,149 --> 01:36:27,025
Go!

892
01:36:28,360 --> 01:36:31,071
<i>Control, we have a clean shot. Do we take it?</i>

893
01:36:31,154 --> 01:36:34,741
<i>- I repeat, do we take it?
- Negative, Team Leader. Negative.</i>

894
01:36:34,824 --> 01:36:38,286
Do you copy?
I want these people alive and kicking.

895
01:36:40,413 --> 01:36:42,916
Go! Get up into the shaft!

896
01:36:53,176 --> 01:36:54,803
<i>(Gin) Come on!</i>

897
01:36:58,431 --> 01:36:59,933
Now...

898
01:37:00,809 --> 01:37:03,061
- Plan B. Turn around.
- What?

899
01:37:03,144 --> 01:37:04,771
Turn around.

900
01:37:07,524 --> 01:37:11,152
This is a mini-chute.
But it only works for the updraft.

901
01:37:12,487 --> 01:37:18,118
- I'm not going without you. We go together.
- No, no, no, too heavy. We'd drop like stones.

902
01:37:18,660 --> 01:37:20,787
So when will I see you again?

903
01:37:20,870 --> 01:37:23,581
Meet me at 6.30am, Pudu train station.

904
01:37:23,665 --> 01:37:26,918
You'd better be there, OK?
Promise me you'll be there.

905
01:37:27,002 --> 01:37:31,589
I will be there. I'm never late.
If I'm late, it's because I'm dead.

906
01:37:31,673 --> 01:37:33,008
Now...

907
01:37:33,299 --> 01:37:34,718
...rip cord.

908
01:37:39,931 --> 01:37:40,974
Ho!

My God! Mac!

912
01:39:49,686 --> 01:39:53,856
- Agh!
- Oh, I'm sorry! I'm sorry. Are you all right?

913
01:39:55,233 --> 01:39:56,651
So what's wrong?

914
01:39:56,734 --> 01:40:02,282
Wrong? Nothing's wrong.
Everything is the... way it has to be.

915
01:40:02,365 --> 01:40:04,200
- What?
- Virginia Baker?

916
01:40:04,284 --> 01:40:07,328
- Special Agent Aaron Thibadeaux, FBI.
- Come on!

917
01:40:07,412 --> 01:40:11,541
You're under arrest for grand larceny.
You have the right to remain silent...

918
01:40:11,624 --> 01:40:12,917
Mac?

919
01:40:13,668 --> 01:40:14,711
Mac!

920
01:40:14,794 --> 01:40:17,630
Anything you say can be used
against you in a court of law.

921
01:40:17,714 --> 01:40:21,175
Thanks, Mac. You got your one minute.

922
01:40:32,812 --> 01:40:34,689
You're a cop.

923
01:40:35,231 --> 01:40:37,942
No. Well, not exactly.

924
01:40:38,026 --> 01:40:42,113
Thibadeaux, believe it or not,
is FBI. And two years ago...

925
01:40:42,196 --> 01:40:47,326
...he caught me and, uh, cut a deal.
The deal was that... I had to deliver you.

926
01:40:49,328 --> 01:40:52,248
They've been onto you for quite a while.

927
01:40:53,833 --> 01:40:56,794
- And Cruz knew, too?
- No, he's just found out.

928
01:40:57,754 --> 01:41:03,801
I don't get it. Why didn't you pick me up
before? What were you waiting for?

929
01:41:04,510 --> 01:41:08,931
Well, at first I, uh... well,
I wanted to see if you could do it.

930
01:41:09,015 --> 01:41:10,767
Bullshit! Come on!

931
01:41:11,809 --> 01:41:14,562
And I wanted to see if I could do it.

932
01:41:15,897 --> 01:41:17,982
Weren't we partners?

933
01:41:18,524 --> 01:41:21,027
I can't believe you'd do this to me.

934
01:41:21,110 --> 01:41:24,781
Well, you'd better believe it! Hm? It's all over.

935
01:41:24,864 --> 01:41:29,118
I gave them Greene,
the Rembrandt, the mask...

936
01:41:29,202 --> 01:41:32,079
...and the full seven billion.

937
01:41:33,372 --> 01:41:35,625
What do you mean, seven?

938
01:41:35,958 --> 01:41:39,587
So you'll just have to make do with one, hm?

939
01:41:41,214 --> 01:41:46,219
- I thought you said one minute.
- Relax, Hector. He knows what he's doin'

940
01:41:46,302 --> 01:41:48,554
Now, plan C.

941
01:41:48,971 --> 01:41:53,559
In your pocket, you'll find an envelope.
A passport, visa, money.

942
01:41:54,101 --> 01:42:00,608
Where you go from here is up to you.
And you'll still hold the record... alone.

943
01:42:00,691 --> 01:42:03,236
<i>(Thibadeaux) Mac!</i>

944
01:42:03,694 --> 01:42:08,783
- I don't understand. Why are you doing this?
- Well, believe me...

945
01:42:09,325 --> 01:42:12,745
...I was prepared for everything, except you.

946
01:42:17,833 --> 01:42:20,836
Mac! Time's up!

947
01:42:21,504 --> 01:42:23,506
Come with me.

948
01:42:23,589 --> 01:42:25,508
Gin...

949
01:42:26,717 --> 01:42:29,011
...your life, it's all ahead of you.

950
01:42:29,095 --> 01:42:32,014
Mine... this is all I've got.

951
01:42:32,098 --> 01:42:33,891
No. You've got me.

952
01:42:36,269 --> 01:42:39,272
<i>(whispers) You got me.</i>

953
01:42:43,359 --> 01:42:47,280
Listen carefully. In your other pocket...

954
01:42:48,364 --> 01:42:50,449
Let's do it.

955
01:42:56,122 --> 01:43:00,293
- Move and I blow his head off!
- Everybody, just be cool.

956
01:43:00,376 --> 01:43:04,255
- Nobody move! No-one moves, OK?
- Fellas, put your weapons down.

957
01:43:04,338 --> 01:43:08,926
- You, too, Hector! I'll kill him if you move!
- We'll get her at the next stop.

958
01:43:09,885 --> 01:43:11,971
Bye, Mac.

959
01:43:12,972 --> 01:43:16,225
She's headed toward the next station.
Move! Move it!

960
01:43:16,309 --> 01:43:19,228
- No guns! Get out of here!
- Move it! Move it!

961
01:43:44,920 --> 01:43:50,217
<i>You know, I don't know
what just went down here...</i>

962
01:43:50,301 --> 01:43:55,056
...but I'm gonna see that you're busted
outta the Bureau for it.

963
01:43:55,181 --> 01:43:59,060
- It ain't over, Mac.
- I believe you.

964
01:44:12,531 --> 01:44:17,244
Well, Mac, this looks like
the end of a terrible friendship.

965
01:44:17,328 --> 01:44:19,914
But you still owe me for today.

966
01:44:21,832 --> 01:44:24,085
I always pay my debts.

967
01:44:25,419 --> 01:44:30,716
Four prototype superchips.
Value: five million dollars each.

968
01:44:39,725 --> 01:44:42,019
Hope she was worth it.

969
01:44:42,686 --> 01:44:44,772
Oh, she was.

970
01:44:45,272 --> 01:44:47,691
I'll be seein' you, Mac.

971
01:44:48,984 --> 01:44:51,070
I don't think so.

972
01:44:55,825 --> 01:44:58,994
OK, Bob, let the people back on the platform.

973
01:44:59,078 --> 01:45:01,163
Bring me a damn car.

974
01:46:12,693 --> 01:46:14,778
How did you do it?

975
01:46:14,862 --> 01:46:19,533
I jumped trains mid-station.
When the train slowed down, I just...

976
01:46:19,617 --> 01:46:22,786
- It was perfect.
- Was it now?

977
01:46:24,538 --> 01:46:28,625
You know what, Mac?
I don't wanna hold the record alone.

978
01:46:28,709 --> 01:46:31,670
- No?
- I need your help on anotherjob.

979
01:46:31,754 --> 01:46:36,717
- The Crown Jewels or something?
- No! Come on, too easy!

980
01:46:36,800 --> 01:46:40,888
I was thinking of... Well...
I know this guy in South Africa.

981
01:46:40,971 --> 01:46:45,517
Diamonds, diamonds, diamonds! The biggest
diamonds you'll ever see in your life!

982
01:46:45,601 --> 01:46:48,103
Have I told you how much I love diamonds?

983
01:46:49,688 --> 01:46:51,857
Mac?

984
01:46:54,443 --> 01:46:56,528
Mac?

985
01:46:57,946 --> 01:47:00,532
- Mac!
- What!

986
01:47:04,328 --> 01:47:06,580
So, what do you think?

987
01:47:06,955 --> 01:47:09,917
- About what?
- About my idea.

988
01:47:12,503 --> 01:47:14,588
It's doable.

989
01:47:18,258 --> 01:47:20,969
- Ohh!
- Oh, I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

990
01:47:49,873 --> 01:47:52,459
<i>? We both know</i>

991

<i>? That if I</i>

1002
01:48:54,771 --> 01:48:58,066
<i>? That if I stay close to your side</i>

1003

<i>? That all of these pressures now</i>

1004
01:49:05,907 --> 01:49:08,994
<i>? I know they will subside</i>

1005
01:49:12,581 --> 01:49:16,918
<i>? You know, if ever you need me, yeah</i>

1006
01:49:17,336 --> 01:49:21,298
<i>? All you gotta do is fall</i>

1007
01:49:24,760 --> 01:49:27,971

<i>? Strangers, so it seems</i>

1016

1017
