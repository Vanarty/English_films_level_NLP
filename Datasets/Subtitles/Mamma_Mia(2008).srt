<i>I have a dream</i>

3
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:02,646
<i>A song to sing</i>

4
00:01:04,406 --> 00:01:08,984
<i>To help me cope</i>

5
00:01:09,077 --> 00:01:12,162
<i>With anything</i>

6
00:01:14,667 --> 00:01:19,209
<i>If you see the wonder</i>

7
00:01:19,296 --> 00:01:23,874
<i>Of a fairy tale</i>

8
00:01:23,967 --> 00:01:26,922
<i>You can take the future</i>

Sam Carmichael.

00:01:40,108 --> 00:01:41,567
Bill Anderson.

12
00:01:44,905 --> 00:01:46,364
Harry Bright.

13
00:01:58,627 --> 00:01:59,956
Gentlemen, I have to go.

14
00:02:00,045 --> 00:02:02,916
Thank you very much. Take care.

15
00:02:09,638 --> 00:02:11,215
Morning, Rodney.

16
00:02:29,909 --> 00:02:31,154
Taxi!

17
00:02:33,162 --> 00:02:35,653
JFK, please, as quick as you can.

18
00:02:58,645 --> 00:03:02,857
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

19
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:09,903
I missed you. Oh, no...

20
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:11,400
- We're...
- We're...

21
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:13,484
Sophie, Ali, Lisa!
We're the greatest, bestest mates!

22
00:03:13,576 --> 00:03:14,608
- I'm tough.
- I'm tall.

23
00:03:14,702 --> 00:03:16,613
- I'm tiny.
- And we're gonna rock this place.

24
00:03:19,583 --> 00:03:23,746
- Sophie, it's beautiful.
- I want one.

25
00:03:23,837 --> 00:03:25,117
He did well, didn't he?

26
00:03:25,213 --> 00:03:27,005
I'm getting married tomorrow.

27
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:28,288
I'm so glad you're here,

28
00:03:28,383 --> 00:03:33,129
because I have a secret
and I can't tell anybody else.

29
00:03:33,222 --> 00:03:37,136
- Sophie, you're knocked up?
- No! No! No!

30
00:03:38,352 --> 00:03:40,474
I've invited my dad to my wedding.

31
00:03:40,604 --> 00:03:42,264
You are joking!

32
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:46,056
- You found him at last?
- No! No, no, no, no, no, not exactly.

33
00:03:48,779 --> 00:03:53,904
Okay. You know what my mom always said
when I asked about my father.

34
00:03:53,992 --> 00:03:56,068
It was a summer romance,

35
00:03:56,161 --> 00:03:59,411
and he'd gone long before she realised
that she was expecting me.

36
00:03:59,497 --> 00:04:02,665
And I'd always kind of accepted that
that's all I'd ever know.

37
00:04:02,751 --> 00:04:06,749
Well, I was ransacking some old trunks
and I found this.

38
00:04:08,423 --> 00:04:11,210
It's the diary she kept
the year she was pregnant with me.

39
00:04:11,301 --> 00:04:13,709
Sophie!

40
00:04:13,803 --> 00:04:17,884
"July 17th. What a night!"

41
00:04:17,975 --> 00:04:20,181
- I don't know if I want to hear this!
- I do!

42
00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:22,807
"Sam rowed me over to the little island."

43
00:04:22,896 --> 00:04:25,434
That's here. That's Kalokairi.

44
00:04:25,524 --> 00:04:28,975
"We danced on the beach,
and we kissed on the beach,

45
00:04:29,069 --> 00:04:31,738
"and dot, dot, dot."

46
00:04:31,821 --> 00:04:32,900
What?

47
00:04:32,989 --> 00:04:36,406
"Dot, dot, dot."
That's what they did in the olden days.

48
00:04:36,744 --> 00:04:37,609
Stop it!

49
00:04:38,704 --> 00:04:41,823
"Sam's the one. I know he is.

50
00:04:41,915 --> 00:04:44,371
"I've never felt like this before."

51
00:04:44,543 --> 00:04:46,085
* HONEY HONEY *

52
00:04:46,169 --> 00:04:47,200
<i>Honey, honey</i>

53
00:04:47,295 --> 00:04:50,879
<i>How he thrills me
Honey, honey</i>

54
00:04:52,968 --> 00:04:54,047
<i>Honey, honey</i>

55
00:04:54,136 --> 00:04:57,884
<i>Nearly kills me
Honey, honey</i>

56
00:04:59,266 --> 00:05:02,599
<i>I've heard about him before</i>

57
00:05:02,686 --> 00:05:06,055
<i>I wanted to know some more</i>

58
00:05:06,148 --> 00:05:08,354
<i>And now I know what they mean</i>

59
00:05:08,442 --> 00:05:11,396
<i>He's a love machine</i>

60
00:05:11,486 --> 00:05:13,278
<i>Oh, he makes me dizzy</i>

61
00:05:15,157 --> 00:05:18,691
<i>Honey, honey
Let me feel it</i>

62
00:05:18,785 --> 00:05:20,161
<i>Honey, honey</i>

63
00:05:22,206 --> 00:05:25,622
<i>Honey, honey
Don't conceal it</i>

64
00:05:25,709 --> 00:05:27,084
<i>Honey, honey</i>

65
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:30,080
<i>The way that you kiss good night</i>

66
00:05:30,172 --> 00:05:31,998
<i>The way that you kiss me good night</i>

67
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:33,549
<i>The way that you hold me tight</i>

68
00:05:33,633 --> 00:05:35,424
<i>The way that you're holding me tight</i>

69
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:37,587
<i>I feel like I wanna sing</i>

70
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,633
<i>When you do your thing</i>

71
00:05:42,809 --> 00:05:46,854
- So this guy Sam's your father!
- The plot thickens.

72
00:05:46,938 --> 00:05:50,639
"All this time, Sam's been telling me
he loves me,

73
00:05:50,733 --> 00:05:52,608
"and now he's announced
that he's engaged,

74
00:05:52,695 --> 00:05:55,186
"so he's gone home to get married,

75
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,905
"and I'm never going to see him again."

76
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:58,235
Poor Donna.

77
00:05:58,325 --> 00:06:02,192
"August 4th. What a night!

78
00:06:02,287 --> 00:06:06,784
"Bill rented a motorboat,
and I took him over to the little island."

79
00:06:06,876 --> 00:06:09,449
- Bill? Sophie, wait.
- Hang on.

80
00:06:10,587 --> 00:06:13,624
"Though I'm still obsessed with Sam,

81
00:06:13,715 --> 00:06:16,384
"Bill's so wild. He's such a funny guy.

82
00:06:16,468 --> 00:06:18,295
"One thing led to another,

83
00:06:18,386 --> 00:06:19,501
"and dot, dot, dot."

84
00:06:20,764 --> 00:06:23,469
"August 11th.
Harry turned up, out of the blue,

85
00:06:23,559 --> 00:06:26,394
"so I said I'd show him the island.

86
00:06:26,478 --> 00:06:29,645
"He's so sweet and understanding,
I couldn't help it and

87
00:06:29,731 --> 00:06:31,309
- "dot, dot, dot!"
- Dot, dot, dot!

88
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,815
- Oh, my God!
- Here come the bridesmaids.

89
00:06:34,903 --> 00:06:37,394
Donna!

90
00:06:37,489 --> 00:06:40,360
Look at you!

91
00:06:40,451 --> 00:06:42,906
God! Stop growing!

92
00:06:44,621 --> 00:06:48,072
- You sound like you're having fun already.
- Oh, we are.

93
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:49,826
I used to have fun.

94
00:06:49,918 --> 00:06:51,293
Oh, we know!

95
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:58,291
<i>Honey, honey
Touch me, baby</i>

96
00:06:58,385 --> 00:07:00,259
<i>Honey, honey</i>

97
00:07:01,722 --> 00:07:05,007
<i>Honey, honey
Hold me, baby</i>

98
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,475
<i>Honey, honey</i>

99
00:07:07,852 --> 00:07:11,352
<i>You look like a movie star</i>

100
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,939
<i>But I love just who you are</i>

101
00:07:15,027 --> 00:07:17,103
<i>And, honey, to say the least</i>

102
00:07:17,195 --> 00:07:19,733
<i>You're a doggone beast</i>

103
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:24,823
Bugger!

104
00:07:25,621 --> 00:07:27,495
My sentiments exactly.

105
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:33,586
So, who is your dad?

106
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:35,663
- Sam, Bill or Harry?
- I don't know.

107
00:07:35,755 --> 00:07:37,962
But which one did you invite?

108
00:07:38,633 --> 00:07:41,967
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!

109
00:07:43,972 --> 00:07:46,261
- Do they know?
- What would you write to a total stranger?

110
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:49,267
"Please come to my wedding,
you might be my father"? No.

111
00:07:49,352 --> 00:07:52,935
They think that Mom sent the invites,
and with what's in here,

112
00:07:53,023 --> 00:07:55,015
no surprise they said yes!

113
00:07:57,528 --> 00:08:00,861
<i>Honey, honey
How you thrill me</i>

114
00:08:00,948 --> 00:08:02,358
<i>Honey, honey</i>

115
00:08:04,368 --> 00:08:07,701
<i>Honey, honey
Nearly kill me</i>

116
00:08:07,787 --> 00:08:09,198
<i>Honey, honey</i>

117
00:08:10,832 --> 00:08:14,083
<i>I'd heard about you before</i>

118
00:08:14,878 --> 00:08:18,958
<i>I wanted to know some more</i>

119
00:08:19,049 --> 00:08:22,050
<i>And now I'm about to see</i>

120
00:08:22,135 --> 00:08:26,964
<i>What you mean to me</i>

121
00:08:29,893 --> 00:08:33,309
I'm trying to get to Kalokairi.
When's the next ferry?

122
00:08:36,191 --> 00:08:37,685
- What?
- Monday.

123
00:08:38,777 --> 00:08:41,777
- Bollocks!
- Yeah, my sentiments exactly.

124
00:08:44,366 --> 00:08:45,908
Bride or groom?

125
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:49,364
Bride, although I've actually never met her.

126
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:50,990
Ahoy, there.

127
00:08:52,374 --> 00:08:54,781
You guys need a ride to Kalokairi?

128
00:08:57,462 --> 00:09:03,832
Excuse me, coming through.
I have a senior citizen with me. Thank you.

129
00:09:03,927 --> 00:09:06,596
My mother needs a perch.

130
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,589
Mother? We're the same age.

131
00:09:08,682 --> 00:09:11,599
Yeah. Well, parts of us are.

132
00:09:14,855 --> 00:09:16,100
Sailor.

133
00:09:17,983 --> 00:09:19,263
No.

134
00:09:28,118 --> 00:09:29,945
Oh, he has your book!

135
00:09:31,163 --> 00:09:32,657
Oh...

136
00:09:33,832 --> 00:09:35,540
Stavros, Stavros.

137
00:09:36,043 --> 00:09:37,074
Stavros.

138
00:09:48,347 --> 00:09:49,971
It's just a fish.

139
00:09:51,808 --> 00:09:53,137
You are so clever.

140
00:09:53,226 --> 00:09:55,634
We're going to look fabulous tomorrow.

141
00:09:55,729 --> 00:09:59,263
I want the perfect wedding,
and I want my father to give me away.

142
00:09:59,357 --> 00:10:01,398
Better be a wide aisle.

143
00:10:01,485 --> 00:10:04,320
I will know my father as soon as I see him.

144
00:10:06,073 --> 00:10:08,231
Sky! Come here, gorgeous.

145
00:10:08,325 --> 00:10:10,152
Put me down.
I'm getting married tomorrow.

146
00:10:10,243 --> 00:10:11,572
Please be careful.

147
00:10:11,661 --> 00:10:13,654
So?
There are pins in the dresses.

148
00:10:13,747 --> 00:10:15,406
What do you think?

149
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:17,500
Oh, yes!

150
00:10:17,585 --> 00:10:19,244
"Oh, yes." If you had your way,

151
00:10:19,336 --> 00:10:22,171
it'd be a three-minute wedding
in jeans and T-shirts,

152
00:10:22,256 --> 00:10:23,963
washed down with a bottle of beer.

153
00:10:24,049 --> 00:10:26,255
You make me sound so unromantic!

154
00:10:26,343 --> 00:10:28,216
I just thought we should save
our money for travelling.

155
00:10:28,303 --> 00:10:30,130
Well, we're not going anywhere yet.

156
00:10:30,221 --> 00:10:33,176
Anyway, please leave. We're very, very busy.

157
00:10:33,267 --> 00:10:35,224
I'm just getting some props for tonight.

158
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:36,390
Ooh!

159
00:10:36,478 --> 00:10:38,850
For his bachelor party.

160
00:10:42,025 --> 00:10:44,350
Why haven't you told him
you've invited your dads?

161
00:10:44,444 --> 00:10:46,686
Because he would say that
I'd have to tell my mom.

162
00:10:46,781 --> 00:10:48,856
Donna's absolutely gonna kill you
when she finds out.

163
00:10:48,949 --> 00:10:51,867
By the time she finds out, it'll be too late.

164
00:10:53,245 --> 00:10:56,032
I feel like there's a part of me missing,

165
00:10:57,582 --> 00:10:59,539
and when I meet my dad,

166
00:11:02,212 --> 00:11:06,673
everything will fall into place.

167
00:11:13,723 --> 00:11:15,846
More open!
I'm on it. I'm on it.

168
00:11:15,934 --> 00:11:17,309
That's good.

169
00:11:19,355 --> 00:11:20,517
That's it.

170
00:11:28,905 --> 00:11:30,696
Come on, Cleopatra.

171
00:11:38,332 --> 00:11:39,363
My shoe!

172
00:11:43,962 --> 00:11:46,749
Will you look at what the tide washed in?

173
00:11:48,341 --> 00:11:53,051
- For one night.
- And one night only.

174
00:11:53,138 --> 00:11:59,057
- Donna and the Dynamos!
- Donna and the Dynamos!

175
00:12:07,069 --> 00:12:08,978
Look at you!

176
00:12:09,071 --> 00:12:11,313
- You baby!
- Look at you!

177
00:12:11,406 --> 00:12:12,735
You look fantastic!

178
00:12:12,824 --> 00:12:14,022
You look like an old hippie!

179
00:12:14,117 --> 00:12:15,908
She looks fab.

180
00:12:15,994 --> 00:12:18,236
These are new, though.
Where did you get these?

181
00:12:18,329 --> 00:12:20,572
Husband number three!

182
00:12:20,666 --> 00:12:24,165
- Dynamos! Dynamite!
- Dynamos! Dynamite!

183
00:12:24,253 --> 00:12:26,126
Sleep all day and...

184
00:12:26,213 --> 00:12:27,956
All night!

185
00:12:34,763 --> 00:12:36,922
So, any men at this wedding?

186
00:12:37,016 --> 00:12:39,471
Gorgeous Greeks of independent means?

187
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:42,810
Here we go! Husband number four!

188
00:12:42,896 --> 00:12:46,680
- No! Not for me, for her!
- He's coming!

189
00:12:46,775 --> 00:12:49,147
For her, now that her book is a bestseller,

190
00:12:49,235 --> 00:12:52,819
and she's got the whole world
stuffing, what,

191
00:12:52,907 --> 00:12:56,856
mushrooms? Various vegetables?

192
00:12:56,952 --> 00:12:58,826
It's time to find Mr Right!

193
00:12:58,912 --> 00:13:01,948
Oh, please. Boring!

194
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:04,994
Great couple of role models
you two are for Sophie!

195
00:13:05,085 --> 00:13:08,086
A serial bride and a little hermit over here!

196
00:13:09,006 --> 00:13:11,579
That's me! I'm a lone wolf!

197
00:13:15,679 --> 00:13:18,798
So, when are the lovebirds
flying the nest?

198
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:22,057
Oh, God! Who knows?

199
00:13:22,143 --> 00:13:26,770
You know, I do not know what is going on
in that child's head sometimes.

200
00:13:26,857 --> 00:13:29,430
She wants a big white wedding, and

201
00:13:29,526 --> 00:13:32,480
she and Sky are making
all kinds of plans for the hotel.

202
00:13:32,571 --> 00:13:34,647
Sometimes I think they'll never leave.

203
00:13:34,739 --> 00:13:37,195
Yeah, but do you really want her to?

204
00:13:37,283 --> 00:13:39,656
Well, I want what's best for her.

205
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:40,901
Of course not!

206
00:13:43,081 --> 00:13:46,415
Sky! Come meet my backup girls.

207
00:13:46,501 --> 00:13:48,375
Backup girls, my ass!
Backup girls, my ass!

208
00:13:48,461 --> 00:13:50,335
He's the leading man at tomorrow's shindig.

209
00:13:50,422 --> 00:13:52,046
- The lucky man.
- Hello.

210
00:13:52,132 --> 00:13:54,623
- You must be Rosie.
- I am.

211
00:13:54,718 --> 00:13:56,675
- How are you?
- Very well.

212
00:13:57,721 --> 00:13:59,548
And you must be Tanya.

213
00:13:59,973 --> 00:14:03,556
- I've heard so much about you.
- All bad, I hope.

214
00:14:03,643 --> 00:14:05,054
- Yes.
- And all true.

215
00:14:05,145 --> 00:14:06,390
Donna... Here, let me get them.

216
00:14:08,731 --> 00:14:12,066
I know who you are.
You're Bill Anderson, aren't you?

217
00:14:14,238 --> 00:14:17,820
<i>- Bloke in a Boat in Botswana.
- Yes, I am.</i>

218
00:14:17,908 --> 00:14:21,074
You know, your books are a godsend
on dull business trips.

219
00:14:21,161 --> 00:14:23,996
Now, I may look like I'm pondering
my securities, but in reality,

220
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:28,707
I'm trekking across
some remote corner of the planet.

221
00:14:28,794 --> 00:14:30,751
You should try it for real sometime.

222
00:14:30,837 --> 00:14:33,874
No, certainly, I'll never be
the spontaneous adventurer.

223
00:14:33,965 --> 00:14:38,212
- You're a close friend of Donna's?
- No, I haven't heard from her for 20 years.

224
00:14:38,303 --> 00:14:40,973
- Really?
- And then this invite, out of the blue.

225
00:14:41,056 --> 00:14:42,800
You know, that's a coincidence,
neither had I.

226
00:14:42,891 --> 00:14:45,429
- Going about!
- You got it!

227
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:50,809
Right. Wait...
I've got it. Fine. Fine.

228
00:14:52,817 --> 00:14:55,439
You should have brought
the iron lung.

229
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:58,026
Why did I wear stilettos?

230
00:14:58,824 --> 00:15:00,900
- Oxygen.
- Oh, my God!

231
00:15:02,536 --> 00:15:04,824
- Auntie Rosie!
- Hey, hey!

232
00:15:04,913 --> 00:15:09,242
- Look at Sophie. She's gotten so beautiful!
- I know.

233
00:15:09,334 --> 00:15:11,742
Come here to me.

234
00:15:13,255 --> 00:15:20,171
Sophie Sheridan, you get more gorgeous
every time I see you. You do.

235
00:15:20,262 --> 00:15:24,259
- I bet you don't remember me.
- Not with all that plastic surgery.

236
00:15:24,974 --> 00:15:28,676
Of course I do, Auntie Tanya.
You haven't changed at all.

237
00:15:30,022 --> 00:15:31,101
- I'm so happy for you.
- Look at my baby,

238
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:33,859
her whole life ahead of her.

239
00:15:33,942 --> 00:15:39,185
Oh, please, I'm getting married.
I'm not joining a convent!

240
00:15:39,281 --> 00:15:41,273
- She's feisty. I love that.
- Yeah.

241
00:15:41,366 --> 00:15:43,655
She's a chip off the old block.

242
00:15:44,453 --> 00:15:47,620
If she were more like me,
she wouldn't be getting married at 20.

243
00:15:47,706 --> 00:15:49,366
Or married at all.

244
00:15:50,459 --> 00:15:53,625
I meant to get the laundry down
before you came.

245
00:15:53,712 --> 00:15:54,743
Tanya's going home!

246
00:15:54,838 --> 00:15:57,792
And you'd think with all this
new technology,

247
00:15:57,883 --> 00:16:00,837
they would figure out a machine
that would make the beds.

248
00:16:00,928 --> 00:16:03,169
And if they did,
you'd be going along behind it,

249
00:16:03,263 --> 00:16:04,592
making them again.

250
00:16:04,681 --> 00:16:06,306
I know you, Mom.

251
00:16:07,517 --> 00:16:11,431
But I am good at modern...
Tell them about the Internets.

252
00:16:11,521 --> 00:16:13,645
- He's gonna put me on the line.
- Online.

253
00:16:13,732 --> 00:16:15,108
I'm designing a website.

254
00:16:15,192 --> 00:16:19,355
I just think this place has so much potential,
and no one knows we're here.

255
00:16:19,446 --> 00:16:23,823
So, if I market it really, really well, then,
hopefully, people will come flooding in.

256
00:16:23,909 --> 00:16:27,823
We just want this to be
the ultimate romantic destination.

257
00:16:27,912 --> 00:16:30,285
This was once supposed to be
the site of Aphrodite's fountain,

258
00:16:30,374 --> 00:16:32,865
you know, the goddess of love.
And if you drank the water,

259
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:35,664
you were supposed to find true love
and perfect happiness.

260
00:16:35,754 --> 00:16:38,671
- I'll have a glass of that.
- Yeah, I'll have a bucket.

261
00:16:38,757 --> 00:16:40,630
<i>Aphrodite's spa?</i>

262
00:16:40,717 --> 00:16:43,208
Well, I thought you didn't want
boatloads of tourists.

263
00:16:43,344 --> 00:16:45,338
Oh, no, not boatloads, no.

264
00:16:45,431 --> 00:16:48,846
But, you know, a few more would be nice.

265
00:16:50,227 --> 00:16:54,176
Okay, now, the thing about the toilet,

266
00:16:54,272 --> 00:16:59,349
if it doesn't flush right away, just go
and come back in a while, and it should...

267
00:17:00,529 --> 00:17:03,020
Nothing works around here, except for me.

268
00:17:03,115 --> 00:17:07,362
I've been running this hotel for 15 years,
and I have never had a day off.

269
00:17:07,452 --> 00:17:08,697
Oh, my God! Sorry.

270
00:17:10,205 --> 00:17:11,236
* MONEY, MONEY, MONEY *

271
00:17:11,331 --> 00:17:12,529
<i>I work all night
I work all day</i>

272
00:17:12,624 --> 00:17:15,875
<i>To pay the bills I have to pay</i>

273
00:17:15,961 --> 00:17:17,372
<i>Ain't it sad?</i>

274
00:17:18,589 --> 00:17:20,380
<i>And still there never seems to be</i>

275
00:17:20,466 --> 00:17:22,873
<i>A single penny left for me</i>

276
00:17:22,968 --> 00:17:24,047
Don't sit down there.

277
00:17:24,136 --> 00:17:25,215
<i>That's too bad</i>

278
00:17:25,303 --> 00:17:26,679
It's broken.

279
00:17:26,763 --> 00:17:30,891
<i>In my dreams
I have a plan</i>

280
00:17:30,975 --> 00:17:34,392
<i>If I got me a wealthy man</i>

281
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,140
<i>I wouldn't have to work at all</i>

282
00:17:36,231 --> 00:17:41,272
<i>I'd fool around and have a ball</i>

283
00:17:46,449 --> 00:17:48,739
<i>Money, money, money</i>

284
00:17:48,827 --> 00:17:50,736
<i>Must be funny</i>

285
00:17:50,829 --> 00:17:52,822
<i>In a rich man's world</i>

286
00:17:54,249 --> 00:17:56,621
<i>Money, money, money</i>

287
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:58,583

<i>If I had a little money</i>

291
00:18:12,517 --> 00:18:14,426
<i>It's a rich man's world</i>

292
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,398
<i>It's a rich man's world</i>

293
00:18:23,612 --> 00:18:25,569
<i>A man like that is hard to find</i>

294
00:18:25,656 --> 00:18:28,740
<i>But I can't get him off my mind</i>

295
00:18:28,825 --> 00:18:30,568
<i>Ain't it sad?</i>

296
00:18:31,453 --> 00:18:33,446
<i>And if he happens to be free</i>

297
00:18:33,539 --> 00:18:35,864
<i>I bet he wouldn't fancy me</i>

298
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:38,250
<i>That's too bad</i>

299
00:18:39,294 --> 00:18:43,790
<i>So I must leave
I have to go</i>

300
00:18:43,882 --> 00:18:47,167
<i>To Las Vegas or Monaco</i>

301
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:49,135
<i>And win a fortune in a game</i>

302
00:18:49,221 --> 00:18:53,966

What's going on?

323
00:20:06,422 --> 00:20:07,882
Do you feel it?

324
00:20:07,967 --> 00:20:10,884
The earth moved, darling.
We're falling apart here.

325
00:20:10,969 --> 00:20:14,089
Don't think about it, come on.
Let's go have fun.

326
00:20:24,692 --> 00:20:26,933
Tanya's packed for a world tour.

327
00:20:28,153 --> 00:20:30,110
Oh, Donna. Donna!

328
00:20:30,572 --> 00:20:32,897
Does she wear it or floss with it?

329
00:20:32,991 --> 00:20:34,189
Floss you.

330
00:20:34,284 --> 00:20:35,398
Is it edible, Tanya?

331
00:20:35,493 --> 00:20:36,572
Listen to this.

332
00:20:37,788 --> 00:20:40,077
"The world's most luxurious moisturiser

333
00:20:40,165 --> 00:20:42,870
"contains flakes of 24-carat gold

334
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,082
"and extracts of donkey testicle."

335
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:46,629
You're just jealous.

336
00:20:46,713 --> 00:20:48,919
At a thousand dollars a dollop.

337
00:20:49,007 --> 00:20:50,585
Tell you, that's the price you have to pay

338
00:20:50,675 --> 00:20:53,131
if you wanna drink before 11:00
in the morning.

339
00:20:53,219 --> 00:20:55,343
- And we do.
- We do.

340
00:20:57,433 --> 00:20:58,464
Hi.

341
00:20:59,810 --> 00:21:00,889
May I help you?

342
00:21:00,978 --> 00:21:02,970
Sure, we're here for the wedding.

343
00:21:03,063 --> 00:21:04,723
- I'm Bill Anderson.
- Huh?

344
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:07,182
I'm Bright, Harry Bright.

345
00:21:08,401 --> 00:21:09,944
Sam Carmichael.

346
00:21:16,743 --> 00:21:18,535
You are expecting us?

347
00:21:18,662 --> 00:21:20,571
Oh, my God. Yes!

348
00:21:21,331 --> 00:21:23,454
You're not Donna's daughter?

349
00:21:24,209 --> 00:21:26,451
I thought you looked familiar.

350
00:21:26,837 --> 00:21:28,117
Sofia.

351
00:21:28,213 --> 00:21:30,918
- It's Sophie.
- Well, Sofia is the Greek.

352
00:21:31,133 --> 00:21:33,754
Well, I'm named after a Sofia.

353
00:21:33,844 --> 00:21:38,173
I used to have a great-aunt
living on the mainland named Sofia.

354
00:21:38,932 --> 00:21:42,218
Would you mind if we see our rooms
before we see your mother?

355
00:21:42,311 --> 00:21:43,390
Sure.

356
00:21:43,479 --> 00:21:45,970
It's just that I'd quite like to freshen up
before the big reunion.

357
00:21:46,064 --> 00:21:49,563
No! No! I mean, yes,

358
00:21:49,651 --> 00:21:51,229
but come this way.

359
00:22:04,958 --> 00:22:05,989
Come on!

360
00:22:11,632 --> 00:22:13,174
Oh, my God!

361
00:22:13,259 --> 00:22:16,212
I got a crack in my courtyard.
I gotta go fix it.

362
00:22:16,303 --> 00:22:18,379
- Hey, listen, Donna? Donna.
- I'm serious. Move.

363
00:22:19,473 --> 00:22:20,552
Sit down!

364
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,016
- She won't let me go!
- I know...

365
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:24,721
I know you're going to make
a fortune with web's...

366
00:22:24,811 --> 00:22:27,350
- "With web's..."
- With Sky's site.

367
00:22:27,439 --> 00:22:28,982
I know you're gonna make a fortune with

368
00:22:29,066 --> 00:22:31,391
- Sky's website, but...
- It's good.

369
00:22:31,485 --> 00:22:33,359
Are you gonna be okay until then?

370
00:22:33,445 --> 00:22:35,900
I think Tanya is offering to pawn her bling.

371
00:22:35,989 --> 00:22:38,397
- No, seriously, Donna...
- Oh, my God.

372
00:22:38,491 --> 00:22:40,733
- Do you need a loan?
- No, sweet.

373
00:22:40,827 --> 00:22:44,446
Oh, God, I'm just whining, you know me.

374
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:46,781
I don't need to be taken care of.

375
00:22:46,875 --> 00:22:49,496
Yeah, but are you being taken care of?

376
00:22:49,586 --> 00:22:52,255
- What do you mean?
- Are you getting any?

377
00:22:52,714 --> 00:22:53,745
Oh, you mean...

378
00:22:58,971 --> 00:23:02,055
Down, boy, down, boy.
No, it takes too much energy.

379
00:23:02,141 --> 00:23:05,177
Yeah. Just more plumbing
to be maintained, isn't it?

380
00:23:05,268 --> 00:23:06,549
Yeah.

381
00:23:06,645 --> 00:23:10,559
Oh, God, I'm so glad
that whole part of my life is over.

382
00:23:10,649 --> 00:23:12,226
You know, seriously.

383
00:23:13,444 --> 00:23:15,769
I do not miss it at all.

384
00:23:20,242 --> 00:23:22,946
Then it's just right here. Good.

385
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:27,738
Where's Donna? Hey! Okay.

386
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:31,294
Up you go.

387
00:23:39,970 --> 00:23:41,001
Hmm.

388
00:23:42,138 --> 00:23:44,012
You know,

389
00:23:44,098 --> 00:23:47,303
I don't want to seem ungrateful
for the scenic tour,

390
00:23:47,394 --> 00:23:48,936
but might I be shown my room now?

391
00:23:49,021 --> 00:23:52,354
Well, don't hold your breath, Harry,
but I think this is your room.

392
00:23:52,441 --> 00:23:53,935
Can we see Donna now?

393
00:23:55,151 --> 00:23:56,895
I sent the invites.

394
00:23:57,445 --> 00:23:59,438
My mom doesn't know anything.

395
00:24:02,117 --> 00:24:05,237
Well, she's done so much for me,
and she's always talking about you guys

396
00:24:05,329 --> 00:24:07,286
and the good old days, and

397
00:24:07,414 --> 00:24:09,786
I thought, what an amazing surprise for her

398
00:24:09,875 --> 00:24:12,412
that you are all gonna be at my wedding.

399
00:24:12,752 --> 00:24:14,875
Hang on, Sophie.

400
00:24:15,213 --> 00:24:16,791
I can't be here.

401
00:24:17,299 --> 00:24:19,090
The last time I saw your mother,

402
00:24:19,176 --> 00:24:21,050
she said she never wanted to see me again.

403
00:24:21,136 --> 00:24:25,216
That was years ago.
Please, it would mean a lot to me.

404
00:24:25,307 --> 00:24:27,465
- Why?
- Listen, I can see that you've been

405
00:24:27,559 --> 00:24:28,638
to a great deal of trouble.

406
00:24:28,727 --> 00:24:31,135
Might I suggest that we all reconvene
on your boat?

407
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:32,641
- Good idea.
- Nope.

408
00:24:33,274 --> 00:24:35,432
- Why?
- It's an adventure, Harry.

409
00:24:35,526 --> 00:24:37,269
- It's good for you.
- Oh, I see.

410
00:24:37,527 --> 00:24:40,528
Okay, when I sent the invites,
it was a long shot that you'd even reply.

411
00:24:40,614 --> 00:24:43,650
And now you've come all this way
for a wedding.

412
00:24:44,034 --> 00:24:48,079
Surely there must have been
some special reason for you to be here.

413
00:24:49,081 --> 00:24:52,284
Like some siren call, maybe?

414
00:24:53,502 --> 00:24:57,998
You're a little minx, you know that?
You're just like your mother.

415
00:24:58,089 --> 00:25:00,627
I'm glad my boys haven't met you.
They'd never recover.

416
00:25:00,717 --> 00:25:02,675
- You have sons?
- Yes, two.

417
00:25:03,762 --> 00:25:06,004
And someday, I'd like to bring them here.

418
00:25:06,098 --> 00:25:07,841
Like you used to bring my mother?

419
00:25:17,192 --> 00:25:18,735
- No.
- It's Donna.

420
00:25:18,819 --> 00:25:21,524
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Listen, listen, she can't know.

421
00:25:21,613 --> 00:25:23,024
I'm going to go. Please stay.

422
00:25:23,115 --> 00:25:27,112
Promise me that you'll not tell anybody
that I invited you.

423
00:25:27,202 --> 00:25:28,696
Okay? Promise?

424
00:25:28,787 --> 00:25:30,993
- You got it, baby.
- It's a promise.

425
00:25:31,081 --> 00:25:33,703
- I might regret it, but okay.
- Okay.

426
00:25:40,173 --> 00:25:42,332
There wouldn't, by any chance,
happen to be a trouser press

427
00:25:42,426 --> 00:25:43,801
on the island, would there?

428
00:26:04,865 --> 00:26:06,573
Harry?

429
00:26:10,746 --> 00:26:11,777
Bill?

430
00:26:11,955 --> 00:26:13,746
* MAMMA MIA *

431
00:26:18,753 --> 00:26:20,830
<i>I was cheated by you</i>

432
00:26:20,923 --> 00:26:22,880
<i>And I think you know when</i>

433
00:26:25,594 --> 00:26:27,800
<i>So I made up my mind</i>

434
00:26:27,888 --> 00:26:29,761
<i>It must come to an end</i>

435
00:26:32,642 --> 00:26:34,599
<i>Look at me now</i>

436
00:26:34,686 --> 00:26:36,097
<i>Will I ever learn?</i>

437
00:26:36,188 --> 00:26:38,264
<i>I don't know how</i>

438
00:26:38,357 --> 00:26:41,607
<i>But I suddenly lose control</i>

439
00:26:41,693 --> 00:26:45,607
<i>There's a fire within my soul</i>

440
00:26:45,697 --> 00:26:49,113
<i>Just one look and
I can hear a bell ring</i>

441
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,404
<i>One more look and
I forget everything</i>

442
00:26:53,956 --> 00:26:57,241
<i>Mamma mia
Here I go again</i>

443
00:26:57,334 --> 00:27:00,833
<i>My, my
How can I resist you?</i>

444
00:27:00,921 --> 00:27:04,289
<i>Mamma mia
Does it show again?</i>

445
00:27:04,382 --> 00:27:07,752
<i>My, my
Just how much I've missed you</i>

446
00:27:07,845 --> 00:27:11,296
<i>Yes, I've been broken-hearted</i>

447
00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:14,805
<i>Blue since the day we parted</i>

448
00:27:14,893 --> 00:27:18,143
<i>Why, why
did I ever let you go?</i>

449
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:21,563
<i>Mamma mia
Now I really know</i>

450
00:27:21,649 --> 00:27:24,817
<i>My, my
I should not have let you go</i>

451
00:27:28,448 --> 00:27:30,488
<i>I was angry and sad</i>

452
00:27:30,575 --> 00:27:32,651
<i>When I knew we were through</i>

453
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:37,405
<i>I can't count all the times</i>

454
00:27:37,499 --> 00:27:39,291
<i>I have cried over you</i>

455
00:27:42,129 --> 00:27:45,663
<i>Look at me now
Will I ever learn?</i>

456
00:27:45,757 --> 00:27:47,833
<i>I don't know how</i>

457
00:27:47,926 --> 00:27:51,342
<i>But I suddenly lose control</i>

458
00:27:51,429 --> 00:27:55,262
<i>There's a fire within my soul</i>

459
00:27:55,351 --> 00:27:58,719
<i>Just one look and
I can hear a bell ring</i>

460
00:27:58,812 --> 00:28:02,228
<i>One more look and
I forget everything</i>

461
00:28:03,567 --> 00:28:06,852
<i>Mamma mia
Here I go again</i>

462
00:28:06,945 --> 00:28:10,361
<i>My, my
How can I resist you?</i>

463
00:28:10,449 --> 00:28:13,900
<i>Mamma mia
Does it show again?</i>

464
00:28:13,994 --> 00:28:17,410
<i>My, my
Just how much I've missed you</i>

465
00:28:17,497 --> 00:28:20,948
<i>Yes, I've been broken-hearted</i>

466
00:28:21,042 --> 00:28:24,412
<i>Blue since the day we parted</i>

467
00:28:24,505 --> 00:28:27,708
<i>Why, why
did I ever let you go?</i>

468
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:31,382
<i>Mamma mia
Now I really know</i>

469
00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:35,253
<i>My, my
I should not have let you go</i>

470
00:28:38,476 --> 00:28:40,055
You always knew how to make an entrance.

471
00:28:44,233 --> 00:28:47,068
I'd better be dreaming.
You'd better not be here.

472
00:28:47,152 --> 00:28:48,563
You want me to pinch you, Donna?

473
00:28:48,653 --> 00:28:53,529
No! You keep your hands to yourself,
Bill Anderson.

474
00:28:54,742 --> 00:28:57,116
You probably don't recognise me, do you?

475
00:28:58,288 --> 00:29:00,910
Harry! It is you!

476
00:29:01,917 --> 00:29:04,752
I probably changed a bit,
but you certainly haven't.

477
00:29:06,546 --> 00:29:09,582
Why are you here?
What are you doing here?

478
00:29:09,674 --> 00:29:11,300
I'm writing a travel piece.

479
00:29:11,385 --> 00:29:13,342
I'm here on
a spontaneous holiday.

480
00:29:13,429 --> 00:29:14,460
Uh-huh.

481
00:29:15,139 --> 00:29:17,427
I just dropped in to say hi.

482
00:29:17,975 --> 00:29:20,300
Okay. What is this?

483
00:29:20,393 --> 00:29:24,261
It's one of those serendipitous moments
in life when three complete strangers

484
00:29:24,356 --> 00:29:26,265
share a common thought.

485
00:29:27,651 --> 00:29:28,932
Strangers?

486
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:33,604
- You don't know each other?
- That's generally the definition.

487
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:36,778
Okay, good, but who... Why are you here?

488
00:29:36,868 --> 00:29:39,157
Who said that you could
stay up in my old goat-house?

489
00:29:39,245 --> 00:29:40,788
- Didn't catch the name.
- Greek lady.

490
00:29:40,872 --> 00:29:42,616
- Well, she spoke Greek.
- Yeah.

491
00:29:42,708 --> 00:29:44,866
Or maybe she said we couldn't
stay in the old goat-house.

492
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,953
- Yeah, maybe that was it, in Greek.
- There you go.

493
00:29:47,045 --> 00:29:49,619
Yeah, that's it, that's it.
You can't stay here because

494
00:29:49,715 --> 00:29:52,668
I'm closed and I'm full.

495
00:29:52,759 --> 00:29:56,591
And I'm busy, I'm really...
I have a wedding, my...

496
00:29:56,679 --> 00:29:58,091
Local girl's getting married...

497
00:29:58,182 --> 00:29:59,462
Donna. Donna, don't worry about us.

498
00:29:59,558 --> 00:30:01,017
Bill here is used to roughing it.

499
00:30:01,101 --> 00:30:03,639
- And Harry here...
- I'm spontaneous.

500
00:30:03,729 --> 00:30:05,104
- Spontaneous.
- Ah.

501
00:30:07,315 --> 00:30:09,023
What about you?

502
00:30:09,109 --> 00:30:11,315
Just wanted to see the island.

503
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:14,027
You know what it meant to me.

504
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:19,403
Okay, I'm gonna arrange for a boat

505
00:30:19,494 --> 00:30:22,994
to take you all back to the mainland.

506
00:30:23,081 --> 00:30:25,074
- I have a boat, Donna.
- You have a boat?

507
00:30:25,166 --> 00:30:26,495
Good, get on it,

508
00:30:26,584 --> 00:30:27,782
and anchors away.

509
00:30:27,877 --> 00:30:29,871
- Hey, Donna...
- Away, away.

510
00:30:30,506 --> 00:30:32,297
It's good to see you.

511
00:30:39,681 --> 00:30:42,682
Now, baby, this should
tickle your taste buds.

512
00:30:42,767 --> 00:30:45,971
Down, big fella.
I'm old enough to be your mother.

513
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:47,682
Grandmother.

514
00:30:48,232 --> 00:30:49,311
Where's Sophie?

515
00:30:49,441 --> 00:30:52,525
- I think she went down to the beach.
- What's up?

516
00:31:01,537 --> 00:31:02,735
Donna?

517
00:31:06,083 --> 00:31:08,206
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

518
00:31:14,716 --> 00:31:16,175
Talk to her.

519
00:31:18,345 --> 00:31:22,259
<i>Chiquitita, tell me what's wrong</i>

520
00:31:26,311 --> 00:31:28,185
Oh, me.

521
00:31:29,147 --> 00:31:33,726
<i>I have never seen such sorrow</i>

522
00:31:36,738 --> 00:31:40,950
<i>In your eyes</i>

523
00:31:41,493 --> 00:31:46,201
<i>And the wedding is tomorrow</i>

524
00:31:48,876 --> 00:31:53,253
<i>How I hate to see you like this</i>

525
00:31:53,338 --> 00:31:58,083
<i>There is no way you can deny it</i>

526
00:31:58,176 --> 00:32:02,305
<i>I can see</i>

527
00:32:02,389 --> 00:32:04,845
<i>That you're oh, so sad</i>

528
00:32:04,933 --> 00:32:06,926
<i>So quiet</i>

529
00:32:10,981 --> 00:32:15,726
<i>Chiquitita, tell me the truth</i>

530
00:32:16,611 --> 00:32:21,854
<i>I'm a shoulder you can cry on</i>

531
00:32:23,952 --> 00:32:27,617
<i>Your best friend</i>

532
00:32:27,956 --> 00:32:32,203
<i>I'm the one you must rely on</i>

533
00:32:33,796 --> 00:32:37,129
<i>You were always sure of yourself</i>

534
00:32:39,384 --> 00:32:43,464
<i>Now I see you've broken a feather</i>

535
00:32:46,975 --> 00:32:53,144
<i>I hope we can patch it up</i>

536
00:32:53,273 --> 00:32:54,933
<i>Together</i>

537
00:32:56,610 --> 00:33:02,233
<i>Chiquitita, you and I know</i>

538
00:33:02,323 --> 00:33:04,447
<i>How the heartaches come and they go</i>

539
00:33:04,535 --> 00:33:08,235
<i>And the scars, they're leaving</i>

540
00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:11,615
<i>You'll be dancing once again</i>

541
00:33:11,708 --> 00:33:14,460
<i>And the pain will end</i>

542
00:33:14,544 --> 00:33:18,458
<i>You will have no time for grieving</i>

543
00:33:20,176 --> 00:33:25,762
<i>Chiquitita, you and I cry</i>

544
00:33:25,847 --> 00:33:28,054
<i>But the sun is still in the sky</i>

545
00:33:28,141 --> 00:33:31,842
<i>And shining above you</i>

546
00:33:31,937 --> 00:33:35,140
<i>Let me hear you sing once more</i>

547
00:33:35,231 --> 00:33:37,984
<i>Like you did before</i>

548
00:33:38,068 --> 00:33:42,066
<i>Sing a new song, Chiquitita</i>

549
00:33:44,199 --> 00:33:46,868
<i>Try once more</i>

550
00:33:46,952 --> 00:33:49,359
<i>Like I did before</i>

551
00:33:50,455 --> 00:33:52,116
<i>Sing a new song</i>

552
00:33:54,043 --> 00:33:56,035
- It's her dad.
- Whose dad?

553
00:33:57,045 --> 00:33:58,504
Sophie's dad.

554
00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:04,550
Remember how I said it was Sam?
Sam the architect,

555
00:34:04,636 --> 00:34:06,213
who had to go home to get married?

556
00:34:06,304 --> 00:34:09,590
I'm not sure that it was him,

557
00:34:09,683 --> 00:34:14,261
because there were two other guys
around the same time.

558
00:34:15,522 --> 00:34:18,688
Donna Sheridan. You shady lady.

559
00:34:18,775 --> 00:34:20,150
Why didn't you tell us?

560
00:34:20,235 --> 00:34:23,818
Well, I never knew that
I would ever, ever have to.

561
00:34:23,906 --> 00:34:27,025
I never imagined I'd see all three of them

562
00:34:27,117 --> 00:34:28,742
in my old goat-house

563
00:34:28,827 --> 00:34:31,400
the day before my daughter's wedding!

564
00:34:31,746 --> 00:34:34,368
- The old goat-house?
- The old goat-house?

565
00:34:37,001 --> 00:34:39,920
No! No! Wait!

566
00:34:40,547 --> 00:34:41,579
Shoot!

567
00:34:42,424 --> 00:34:45,093
Rosie! Tanya!

568
00:34:45,427 --> 00:34:47,752
Wait a minute! Don't let them hear you!

569
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:51,797
- There's no one here.
- Are you sure?

570
00:34:51,891 --> 00:34:53,351
Of course I'm sure!

571
00:34:53,435 --> 00:34:56,009
Do you think
I would forget my daughter's dads?

572
00:34:56,105 --> 00:34:59,022
They were all here. Sam Carmichael,

573
00:34:59,107 --> 00:35:02,108
Bill Anderson and Harry "Head Banger."

574
00:35:02,194 --> 00:35:03,474
Harry "Head Banger."

575
00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:05,313
They must've gone
back to their boat.

576
00:35:05,405 --> 00:35:08,074
I hope they run aground and drown.

577
00:35:08,158 --> 00:35:09,866
What are they doing here?

578
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:11,612
It's like some hideous trick of fate.

579
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:24,338
It's very Greek.

580
00:35:26,468 --> 00:35:30,217
- Do they know about Sophie?
- What are they, psychic?

581
00:35:30,305 --> 00:35:32,464
No! I've never told a soul.

582
00:35:32,557 --> 00:35:36,009
Oh, Donna,
keeping it to yourself all these years.

583
00:35:36,102 --> 00:35:38,344
It doesn't matter about me.

584
00:35:38,438 --> 00:35:43,978
The only thing that matters
is that Sophie never finds out.

585
00:35:44,069 --> 00:35:46,311
Well, maybe she would be cool with it.

586
00:35:46,405 --> 00:35:47,947
"Cool with it"?

587
00:35:51,117 --> 00:35:53,324
You don't know my daughter.
This would be like a bombshell.

588
00:35:53,411 --> 00:35:55,071
Donna, they've gone!

589
00:35:55,163 --> 00:35:56,955
I don't know that.

590
00:35:57,041 --> 00:36:00,824
I don't know where they are.
I don't know why they're here.

591
00:36:00,919 --> 00:36:03,125
And I have brought this all on myself

592
00:36:03,213 --> 00:36:06,333
because I was a stupid, reckless little slut!

593
00:36:06,424 --> 00:36:08,832
Whoa!

594
00:36:08,927 --> 00:36:11,335
Don't you sound like your mother?

595
00:36:12,014 --> 00:36:14,421
- I do not!
- Yes, you so do!

596
00:36:14,516 --> 00:36:17,434
- Oh, my God, I do not.
- You do, it's Catholic guilt!

597
00:36:17,519 --> 00:36:19,144
You've been living like a nun.

598
00:36:19,229 --> 00:36:21,637
Yeah, whatever happened to our Donna?

599
00:36:21,731 --> 00:36:23,854
Life and soul of the party,

600
00:36:23,942 --> 00:36:26,694
<i>- el rock chick supremo?
- Yeah, come on.</i>

601
00:36:27,821 --> 00:36:31,522
- I grew up.
- Well, then, grow back down again.

602
00:36:31,617 --> 00:36:33,574
- Screw them if they can't take a joke.
- Screw them if they can't take a joke.

603
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:34,691
* DANCING QUEEN *

604
00:36:34,786 --> 00:36:37,075
<i>You can dance</i>

605
00:36:37,163 --> 00:36:39,489
<i>You can jive</i>

<i>Watch that scene</i>

609
00:36:48,634 --> 00:36:51,587
<i>Dig in the dancing queen</i>

610
00:36:58,769 --> 00:37:02,102
<i>Friday night and the lights are low</i>

611
00:37:03,607 --> 00:37:08,019
<i>Looking out for a place to go</i>

612
00:37:08,403 --> 00:37:10,728
<i>Where they play the right music</i>

613
00:37:10,822 --> 00:37:12,530
<i>Getting in the swing</i>

614
00:37:12,615 --> 00:37:15,653
<i>You come to look for a king</i>

615
00:37:17,996 --> 00:37:22,409
<i>Anybody could be that guy</i>

616
00:37:22,709 --> 00:37:27,537
<i>Night is young
and the music's high</i>

617
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:31,711
<i>With a bit of rock music
Everything is fine</i>

618
00:37:31,844 --> 00:37:35,343

<i>You're a teaser
You turn them on</i>

632
00:38:34,907 --> 00:38:39,615
<i>Leave them burning
And then you're gone</i>

633
00:38:39,703 --> 00:38:43,783

<i>Dig in the dancing queen</i>

654
00:40:27,853 --> 00:40:32,146
Wait, wait. Wait!
Hey, don't leave.

655
00:40:36,946 --> 00:40:40,149
- Whoa, Sophie.
- Sophie!

656
00:40:44,786 --> 00:40:47,359
We're gonna sail around the island.
You wanna come?

657
00:40:47,455 --> 00:40:49,744
You promised you'd come to my wedding.

658
00:40:49,874 --> 00:40:53,125
Yes, well, your mother ejected us
from the goat-house.

659
00:40:53,212 --> 00:40:55,288
She thought we'd better get out of her hair.

660
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:57,788
Donna freaked out when she saw us.

661
00:40:57,883 --> 00:41:00,290
- What's all that about?
- No.

662
00:41:01,178 --> 00:41:04,381
She's just not even thinking straight.
She's so stressed about the wedding.

663
00:41:04,472 --> 00:41:07,889
You know, but she's got no idea
that you're her lovely surprise.

664
00:41:07,977 --> 00:41:09,934
- She'll be so happy tomorrow.
- You think so?

665
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:11,051
Mmm-hmm.

666
00:41:12,147 --> 00:41:16,061
- You took Mom's guitar!
- No, no. I borrowed it. Look.

667
00:41:17,277 --> 00:41:18,605
No, where is it?

668
00:41:18,695 --> 00:41:20,154
D.S.

669
00:41:20,238 --> 00:41:21,269
Donna Sheridan.

670
00:41:21,364 --> 00:41:22,610
And H.B.

671
00:41:23,617 --> 00:41:24,648
Head Banger.

672
00:41:25,369 --> 00:41:26,780
- Head Banger?
- Head Banger?

673
00:41:26,870 --> 00:41:30,453
I bought her this. It cost me ten quid
plus my Johnny Rotten T-shirt.

674
00:41:32,751 --> 00:41:34,577
Your mother knew quite a rebel.

675
00:41:34,669 --> 00:41:37,540
I was studying in Paris when I met her.

676
00:41:39,258 --> 00:41:42,674
I hopped on a train
and followed her to Greece,

677
00:41:46,139 --> 00:41:47,966
quite spontaneously.

678
00:41:49,184 --> 00:41:50,927
<i>I can still recall</i>

679
00:41:51,603 --> 00:41:54,095
<i>Our last summer</i>

680
00:41:54,189 --> 00:41:56,099
<i>I still see it all</i>

681
00:41:59,152 --> 00:42:01,524
<i>Walks along the Seine</i>

682
00:42:01,613 --> 00:42:04,021
<i>Laughing in the rain</i>

683
00:42:04,115 --> 00:42:06,523
<i>Our last summer</i>

684
00:42:06,618 --> 00:42:09,110
<i>Memories that remain</i>

685
00:42:10,581 --> 00:42:13,368
<i>We made our way along the river</i>

686
00:42:13,459 --> 00:42:16,495
<i>And we sat down in the grass</i>

687
00:42:16,586 --> 00:42:19,160
<i>By the Eiffel Tower</i>

688
00:42:20,674 --> 00:42:23,378
<i>I was so happy we had met</i>

689
00:42:25,679 --> 00:42:28,466
<i>It was the age of no regret</i>

690
00:42:29,057 --> 00:42:30,967
<i>Oh, yes</i>

691
00:42:33,228 --> 00:42:36,229
<i>Those crazy years, that was the time</i>

692
00:42:36,564 --> 00:42:39,399
<i>Of the flower power</i>

693
00:42:40,653 --> 00:42:45,694
<i>But underneath we had a fear of flying</i>

694
00:42:45,782 --> 00:42:47,691
<i>Of growing old</i>

695
00:42:48,201 --> 00:42:50,194
<i>A fear of slowly dying</i>

696
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:53,076
<i>We took a chance</i>

697
00:42:53,164 --> 00:42:58,504
<i>Like we were dancing our last dance</i>

698
00:42:59,046 --> 00:43:01,252
<i>I can still recall</i>

699
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:04,009
<i>Our last summer</i>

700
00:43:04,092 --> 00:43:06,630
<i>I still see it all</i>

701
00:43:09,139 --> 00:43:13,433
<i>In the tourist jam
round the Notre Dame</i>

702
00:43:14,103 --> 00:43:18,563
<i>Our last summer
Walking hand in hand</i>

703
00:43:19,107 --> 00:43:21,598
<i>Paris restaurants</i>

704
00:43:21,693 --> 00:43:27,281
<i>Our last summer
Morning croissants</i>

705
00:43:29,118 --> 00:43:31,157
<i>Living for the day</i>

706
00:43:31,620 --> 00:43:33,529
<i>Worries far away</i>

707
00:43:34,122 --> 00:43:36,281
<i>Our last summer</i>

708
00:43:36,666 --> 00:43:40,450
<i>We could laugh and play</i>

709
00:43:40,712 --> 00:43:43,417
<i>And now you're working in a bank</i>

710
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:49,047
<i>A family man, a football fan</i>

711
00:43:49,137 --> 00:43:52,636
<i>And your name is Harry</i>

712
00:43:53,350 --> 00:43:55,141
<i>How dull it seems</i>

713
00:43:55,685 --> 00:44:01,226
<i>Are you the hero
of my dreams?</i>

714
00:44:02,276 --> 00:44:05,111
Sophie!

715
00:44:07,322 --> 00:44:10,109
- Sophie!
- Please, I have to go,

716
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:12,738
- but please come tomorrow, okay?
- Absolutely.

717
00:44:12,869 --> 00:44:14,862
- We'll be there.
- It's a promise.

718
00:44:21,670 --> 00:44:24,077
<i>Walks along the Seine</i>

719
00:44:24,172 --> 00:44:26,663
<i>Laughing in the rain</i>

720
00:44:26,758 --> 00:44:29,546
<i>Our last summer</i>

721
00:44:29,637 --> 00:44:34,179
<i>Memories that remain</i>

722
00:44:37,144 --> 00:44:38,175
Sky!

723
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:40,228
Where've you been?

724
00:44:40,605 --> 00:44:43,476
People have been arriving all afternoon.
No one's seen you.

725
00:44:43,566 --> 00:44:46,189
I'm sorry, I was around the island, I just...

726
00:44:46,278 --> 00:44:48,436
I just lost track of time.

727
00:44:50,157 --> 00:44:52,826
- Where're you going?
- It's my stag do.

728
00:44:53,535 --> 00:44:55,527
My last night of freedom.

729
00:44:57,372 --> 00:45:00,658
Which is how some people might see it,
but for me,

730
00:45:01,210 --> 00:45:04,376
it's the last night before
the greatest adventure of my life.

731
00:45:06,423 --> 00:45:08,795
You know how I said I wanted
to find my father?

732
00:45:08,884 --> 00:45:11,256
Soph, we've been over this a million times.

733
00:45:11,344 --> 00:45:13,633
You don't need a father, you have a family.

734
00:45:13,721 --> 00:45:15,430
And you'll never leave me, right?

735
00:45:15,516 --> 00:45:19,300
Are you kidding?
You have turned my world upside down.

736
00:45:19,603 --> 00:45:21,263
* LAYALL YOUR LO VE ON ME *

737
00:45:21,355 --> 00:45:23,976
<i>I wasn't jealous before we met</i>

738
00:45:24,775 --> 00:45:29,566
<i>Now every man that
I see is a potential threat</i>

739
00:45:31,991 --> 00:45:35,573
<i>And I'm possessive
It isn't nice</i>

740
00:45:35,661 --> 00:45:40,406
<i>You've heard me saying
that smoking was my only vice</i>

741
00:45:42,334 --> 00:45:44,871
<i>But now it isn't true</i>

742
00:45:46,171 --> 00:45:48,378
<i>Now everything is new</i>

743
00:45:49,842 --> 00:45:53,341
<i>And all I've learned has overturned</i>

744
00:45:53,428 --> 00:45:57,473
<i>I beg of you</i>

745
00:45:59,100 --> 00:46:05,471
<i>Don't go wasting your emotion</i>

746
00:46:06,275 --> 00:46:12,147
<i>Lay all your love on me</i>

747
00:46:13,782 --> 00:46:16,486
<i>It was like shooting a sitting duck</i>

748
00:46:17,368 --> 00:46:21,698
<i>A little small talk, a smile
and, baby, I was stuck</i>

749
00:46:24,626 --> 00:46:27,912
<i>I still don't know what you've done with me</i>

750
00:46:28,213 --> 00:46:32,673
<i>A grown-up woman
should never fall so easily</i>

751
00:46:35,012 --> 00:46:38,013
<i>I feel a kind of fear</i>

752
00:46:38,557 --> 00:46:41,926
<i>When I don't have you near</i>

753
00:46:42,185 --> 00:46:45,768
<i>Unsatisfied, I skip my pride</i>

754
00:46:45,855 --> 00:46:50,150
<i>I beg you, dear</i>

755
00:46:51,445 --> 00:46:57,697
<i>Don't go wasting your emotion</i>

756
00:46:58,660 --> 00:47:04,699
<i>Lay all your love on me</i>

757
00:47:05,918 --> 00:47:12,798
<i>Don't go sharing your devotion</i>

758
00:47:13,133 --> 00:47:18,257
<i>Lay all your love on me</i>

759
00:47:20,391 --> 00:47:27,104
<i>Don't go wasting your emotion</i>

760
00:47:27,606 --> 00:47:31,140
<i>Lay all your love on me</i>

761
00:47:31,234 --> 00:47:37,984
<i>Don't go sharing your devotion</i>

762
00:47:38,409 --> 00:47:43,236
<i>Lay all your love on me</i>

763
00:47:49,878 --> 00:47:53,497
<i>Ladies and no gentlemen,</i>

764
00:47:54,049 --> 00:47:58,794
<i>presenting, for one night
and one night only...</i>

765
00:47:58,887 --> 00:48:00,844
Because that's all
we've got breath for.

766
00:48:00,931 --> 00:48:03,089
Speak for yourself, you old bat!

767
00:48:03,183 --> 00:48:06,183
<i>The world's first girl power band,</i>

768
00:48:07,396 --> 00:48:10,599
<i>Donna and the Dynamos.</i>

769
00:48:22,828 --> 00:48:25,117
<i>Super Trouper</i>

770
00:48:25,205 --> 00:48:27,114
<i>Lights are gonna find me</i>

771
00:48:27,291 --> 00:48:31,074
<i>But I won't feel blue</i>

772
00:48:31,419 --> 00:48:35,251
<i>Like I always do</i>

773
00:48:35,548 --> 00:48:40,092
<i>'Cause somewhere in the crowd, there's you</i>

774
00:48:43,473 --> 00:48:45,383
* SUPER TROUPER *

775
00:48:59,489 --> 00:49:02,692
<i>I was sick and tired of everything</i>

776
00:49:02,784 --> 00:49:07,446
<i>When I called you last night from Glasgow</i>

777
00:49:07,539 --> 00:49:10,873
<i>All I do is eat and sleep and sing</i>

778
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:13,830
<i>Wishing every show was the last show</i>

779
00:49:13,921 --> 00:49:16,079
<i>Wishing every show was the last show</i>

780
00:49:16,173 --> 00:49:20,004
<i>So imagine
I was glad to hear you're coming</i>

781
00:49:20,093 --> 00:49:22,216
<i>Suddenly I feel all right</i>

782
00:49:22,303 --> 00:49:24,177
<i>And suddenly it's gonna be</i>

783
00:49:24,264 --> 00:49:30,516
<i>And it's gonna be so different
when I'm on the stage tonight</i>

784
00:49:30,854 --> 00:49:33,641
<i>Tonight the Super Trouper</i>

785
00:49:33,732 --> 00:49:35,523
<i>Lights are gonna find me</i>

786
00:49:35,817 --> 00:49:38,189
- Our song.
- Your song?

787
00:49:38,403 --> 00:49:39,482
It's my song.

788
00:49:39,571 --> 00:49:43,272
<i>Smiling, having fun</i>

789
00:49:43,492 --> 00:49:46,777
<i>Feeling like a number one</i>

790
00:49:46,870 --> 00:49:49,361
<i>Tonight the Super Trouper</i>

791
00:49:49,456 --> 00:49:51,532
<i>Beams are gonna blind me</i>

792
00:49:51,625 --> 00:49:55,242
<i>But I won't feel blue</i>

793
00:49:55,336 --> 00:49:59,002
<i>Like I always do</i>

794
00:49:59,091 --> 00:50:03,883
<i>'Cause somewhere in the crowd, there's you</i>

795
00:50:04,888 --> 00:50:08,553
<i>So I'll be there when you arrive</i>

796
00:50:08,641 --> 00:50:12,142
<i>The sight of you will prove to me
I'm still alive</i>

797
00:50:12,229 --> 00:50:15,016
<i>And when you take me in your arms</i>

798
00:50:15,107 --> 00:50:17,313
<i>And hold me tight</i>

799
00:50:17,401 --> 00:50:22,905
<i>I know it's gonna mean so much tonight</i>

800
00:50:22,989 --> 00:50:25,480
<i>Tonight the Super Trouper</i>

801
00:50:25,575 --> 00:50:27,568
<i>Lights are gonna find me</i>

802
00:50:27,661 --> 00:50:30,413
<i>Shining like the sun</i>

803
00:50:30,497 --> 00:50:31,528
Look, look, look, look, look.

804
00:50:31,623 --> 00:50:35,490
<i>Smiling, having fun</i>

805
00:50:35,585 --> 00:50:38,788
<i>Feeling like a number one</i>

806
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:41,549
<i>Tonight the Super Trouper</i>

807
00:50:41,633 --> 00:50:43,543
<i>Beams are gonna blind me</i>

808
00:50:43,636 --> 00:50:47,336
<i>But I won't feel blue</i>

809
00:50:47,431 --> 00:50:51,262
<i>Like I always do</i>

810
00:50:51,351 --> 00:50:56,143
<i>'Cause somewhere in the crowd, there's you</i>

811
00:50:56,231 --> 00:50:58,141
<i>Super Trouper lights</i>

812
00:50:58,234 --> 00:51:02,480
<i>Are gonna find me</i>

813
00:51:08,034 --> 00:51:09,659
I can't believe you!

814
00:51:11,830 --> 00:51:13,989
<i>Excuse me! Hello.</i>

815
00:51:14,083 --> 00:51:17,617
<i>This is a hen party. Women only!</i>

816
00:51:17,711 --> 00:51:18,826
<i>- Thank you.
- Okay.</i>

817
00:51:21,298 --> 00:51:23,789
Why are they here, then,

818
00:51:23,884 --> 00:51:26,291
if it's not to ruin Sophie's wedding?

819
00:51:26,386 --> 00:51:29,388
But I thought you weren't so keen
on this wedding.

820
00:51:29,598 --> 00:51:31,591
I don't want them spoiling it.

821
00:51:31,684 --> 00:51:33,806
They have no right to turn up like this.

822
00:51:33,894 --> 00:51:36,563
What have they ever done
for their daughter?

823
00:51:36,646 --> 00:51:38,805
Donna, Donna, they didn't know she existed.

824
00:51:38,899 --> 00:51:40,891
Well, they didn't need to know, did they?

825
00:51:40,984 --> 00:51:43,356
I've done a great job with Soph,
all by myself,

826
00:51:43,444 --> 00:51:46,649
and I won't be muscled out
by an ejaculation!

827
00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:47,771
* GIMME! GIMME! GIMME! *

828
00:51:47,866 --> 00:51:49,942
<i>Is there a man out there?</i>

829
00:51:51,370 --> 00:51:58,332
<i>Someone to hear my prayer?</i>

830
00:51:59,127 --> 00:52:02,793
<i>Gimme! Gimme! Gimme!
A man after midnight</i>

831
00:52:02,881 --> 00:52:06,499
<i>Won't somebody help me
Chase the shadows away</i>

832
00:52:07,219 --> 00:52:10,303
<i>Gimme! Gimme! Gimme!
A man after midnight</i>

833
00:52:10,388 --> 00:52:11,847
- Hi.
- Hi.

834
00:52:13,183 --> 00:52:16,019
I think I should explain to Donna
that I come in peace.

835
00:52:16,103 --> 00:52:19,686
Oh, no, really. You should wait
until she has a few drinks in her first.

836
00:52:19,773 --> 00:52:21,766
- Really.
- Good idea. Good idea.

837
00:52:22,943 --> 00:52:24,686
What you drew on the boat...

838
00:52:26,071 --> 00:52:28,526
This is good. This is really good.

839
00:52:28,698 --> 00:52:31,783
Why don't you pursue this?
You have a real talent here.

840
00:52:33,162 --> 00:52:34,988
I have enough to do here.

841
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:37,073
Is that really your dream?

842
00:52:37,416 --> 00:52:39,159
Running the villa with Donna?

843
00:52:39,251 --> 00:52:41,327
She just can't do it by herself.

844
00:52:44,214 --> 00:52:45,624
Do you know,

845
00:52:45,715 --> 00:52:49,381
I drew this whole place up
on the back of a menu one night.

846
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:51,380
I always dreamt I'd come back here.

847
00:52:51,471 --> 00:52:52,966
What kept you?

848
00:52:53,515 --> 00:52:55,554
What's your mother said about me?

849
00:52:55,642 --> 00:52:58,512
- She never mentioned you.
- Sophie?

850
00:53:00,563 --> 00:53:02,356
What am I doing here?

851
00:53:03,776 --> 00:53:05,519
Some air in here.

852
00:53:08,488 --> 00:53:11,062
Somebody up there has got it in for me.

853
00:53:11,241 --> 00:53:12,404
I bet it's my mother.

854
00:53:12,492 --> 00:53:14,401
Oh,
and wasn't she a ray of sunshine.

855
00:53:14,494 --> 00:53:16,570
I'm gonna go get them out of here.

856
00:53:18,582 --> 00:53:21,666
You go in there guns loaded,
there's gonna be questions.

857
00:53:21,752 --> 00:53:23,744
- Help me out of these boots.
- Come on, then.

858
00:53:23,837 --> 00:53:26,375
All that fricking yoga's
made my feet bigger.

859
00:53:26,465 --> 00:53:29,252
Now, listen.
Listen, what we're gonna do is,

860
00:53:29,759 --> 00:53:31,835
we'll get them plastered tonight,

861
00:53:31,928 --> 00:53:36,425
and then tomorrow,
Tanya and I will take them fishing.

862
00:53:36,809 --> 00:53:39,264
Fishing? Oh, please.

863
00:53:39,728 --> 00:53:42,433
What do you suggest
we do with three men?

864
00:53:42,898 --> 00:53:45,934
Well, then, now, that takes me back.

865
00:53:47,235 --> 00:53:48,646
<i>Gimme! Gimme! Gimme!</i>

866
00:53:48,737 --> 00:53:50,944
<i>A man after midnight</i>

867
00:53:51,031 --> 00:53:54,780
<i>Take me through the darkness
To the break of the day</i>

868
00:53:59,789 --> 00:54:02,707
- Hello.
- You okay?

869
00:54:02,792 --> 00:54:04,453
I'm fine.

870
00:54:07,047 --> 00:54:09,620
Fancy Donna having a grown-up daughter!

871
00:54:10,175 --> 00:54:14,636
- Do you have any children, Harry?
- Well, I have the dogs, Lucy and Kipper.

872
00:54:14,721 --> 00:54:17,212
That's the extent of my relationships.

873
00:54:17,307 --> 00:54:20,759
I'd have loved a daughter.
I'd have spoiled her rotten.

874
00:54:23,689 --> 00:54:26,310
- Is your father here?
- I don't know.

875
00:54:29,152 --> 00:54:31,228
I don't know who my father is.

876
00:54:32,781 --> 00:54:34,654
<i>Is there a man out there?</i>

877
00:54:36,452 --> 00:54:39,025
<i>Someone to hear my prayer?</i>

878
00:54:40,455 --> 00:54:42,163
This is fantastic!

879
00:54:44,042 --> 00:54:47,328
How on earth did Donna get money
to buy this place?

880
00:54:47,420 --> 00:54:51,466
She was left some money by the old lady
she looked after when I was little.

881
00:54:52,301 --> 00:54:55,586
- Sofia, that I'm named after.
- My great-aunt Sofia?

882
00:54:55,971 --> 00:54:57,216
I guess.

883
00:54:58,015 --> 00:55:00,968
I always heard her money was left to family.

884
00:55:08,150 --> 00:55:10,308
- How old are you?
- I'm 20.

885
00:55:14,031 --> 00:55:16,189
Will you excuse me a minute?

886
00:55:19,494 --> 00:55:20,774
I'm sorry.

887
00:55:24,208 --> 00:55:25,322
Bill!

888
00:55:27,044 --> 00:55:28,419
Bill, wait.

889
00:55:29,338 --> 00:55:31,793
Why did your great-aunt
leave my mother money?

890
00:55:31,882 --> 00:55:33,376
I don't know!

891
00:55:33,466 --> 00:55:36,088
All my life, there's been
this huge unanswered question,

892
00:55:36,177 --> 00:55:38,586
and I don't want any more secrecy!

893
00:55:38,681 --> 00:55:41,634
- What do you want from me?
- Bill, please!

894
00:55:46,063 --> 00:55:47,770
Are you my father?

895
00:55:48,565 --> 00:55:51,103
Yes. I think so.

896
00:55:53,904 --> 00:55:54,935
Yes.

897
00:55:56,365 --> 00:55:58,073
You know what comes next?

898
00:55:58,283 --> 00:56:02,577
Oh, you're not going to tell me
that you have a twin sister, are you?

899
00:56:04,039 --> 00:56:05,996
Will you give me away tomorrow?

900
00:56:06,416 --> 00:56:09,583
- Give you away?
- No! Our secret until the wedding.

901
00:56:12,673 --> 00:56:13,871
Cute.

902
00:56:18,762 --> 00:56:19,960
Oh, God.

903
00:56:23,266 --> 00:56:24,382
Okay.

I know why I'm here.

925
00:57:48,852 --> 00:57:52,387
Why didn't Donna tell me?
How long have you known I'm your father?

926
00:57:52,939 --> 00:57:56,142
What? Not long at all.

927
00:57:56,651 --> 00:58:00,400
Sam, listen to me.
My mom doesn't know that I know.

928
00:58:00,989 --> 00:58:03,065
So can we wait until after my wedding?

929
00:58:03,158 --> 00:58:05,316
- Who's giving you away tomorrow?
- Nobody.

Now, that's why you sent me the invite.

945
00:58:38,985 --> 00:58:42,069
You wanted your old dad
to walk you down the aisle.

Come on, Mother, rise and shine.

964
00:59:35,876 --> 00:59:37,370
I was tossing and turning all night.

965
00:59:38,628 --> 00:59:41,795
Those three guys are still loose
on this island.

966
00:59:41,881 --> 00:59:42,961
We got to do something.

967
00:59:43,049 --> 00:59:46,335
Donna! Donna! Donna! Donna.
It's all under control.

968
00:59:46,637 --> 00:59:50,385
I have been tossing and turning all night.
I've got three dads coming to my wedding,

969
00:59:50,474 --> 00:59:53,047
and I have to tell two of them
they're surplus. Only, which two?

970
00:59:53,143 --> 00:59:54,471
It's all under control.

971
00:59:54,561 --> 00:59:56,470
I'm taking Bill and Sam fishing...

972
00:59:56,563 --> 00:59:58,769
We're each gonna go off.
We're gonna grab a man,

973
00:59:58,857 --> 01:00:01,182
interrogate him, swap notes and decide.

974
01:00:01,276 --> 01:00:03,898
And Harry's talked Tanya into water sports.

975
01:00:05,322 --> 01:00:08,323
Oh, God.
Nurse, donkey testicles, quickly!

976
01:00:32,056 --> 01:00:34,679
- No, after you. Please.
- No. No. Go ahead.

977
01:00:35,019 --> 01:00:37,058
No, no, no, no, you first.

978
01:00:38,355 --> 01:00:41,391
- I want to get something off my chest.
- Me, too.

979
01:00:48,991 --> 01:00:51,945
Last night,
I discovered something wonderful.

980
01:00:52,536 --> 01:00:55,869
It was a wake-up call,
a way to look at myself and

981
01:00:56,164 --> 01:00:58,489
what I really want out of life.

982
01:01:00,460 --> 01:01:03,745
Last night? You didn't know?

983
01:01:05,341 --> 01:01:08,010
You didn't even suspect that you were...

984
01:01:08,093 --> 01:01:11,462
Well, no. Of course not.
That's always been a secret.

985
01:01:14,015 --> 01:01:16,387
And now we... Say it out loud.

986
01:01:16,476 --> 01:01:19,893
No! No! No! It's absolutely hush-hush.
I mean, for now.

987
01:01:20,439 --> 01:01:22,681
All will be revealed tonight.

988
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:26,235
Talking of revelations, last night...

989
01:01:27,988 --> 01:01:31,570
You and the little lady?
I think I know what's going on.

990
01:01:33,326 --> 01:01:35,200
- No, you don't. You don't.
- It's obvious.

991
01:01:35,286 --> 01:01:38,371
I saw it from the moment
you clapped eyes on each other.

992
01:01:39,291 --> 01:01:40,750
You're kidding.

993
01:01:42,252 --> 01:01:44,292
I'm gonna level with you, Harry.

994
01:01:44,504 --> 01:01:46,662
I don't think I can do this.

995
01:01:46,965 --> 01:01:49,123
Well, she's a wonderful girl,

996
01:01:49,843 --> 01:01:52,299
but can I take her on in my life?

997
01:01:52,554 --> 01:01:55,259
Bill, where's your spontaneity?

998
01:01:55,974 --> 01:01:57,682
It's this...

999
01:01:58,643 --> 01:02:02,511
- This family, you know?
- You don't have to marry her.

1000
01:02:03,398 --> 01:02:04,429
What?

1001
01:02:06,067 --> 01:02:09,104
Hey, right in time for breakfast.

1002
01:02:09,196 --> 01:02:11,983
We're serving up the works here.

1003
01:02:12,074 --> 01:02:15,442
- Think you just did.
- Sunny-side up! Lox or ham?

1004
01:02:15,785 --> 01:02:17,244
I'll just...

1005
01:02:19,789 --> 01:02:21,449
I'm just gonna...

1006
01:02:24,503 --> 01:02:26,127
What a mess!

1007
01:02:28,507 --> 01:02:30,215
- Hey!
- What?

1008
01:02:31,343 --> 01:02:33,798
- You okay?
- Yeah. I'm fine. I'm fine.

1009
01:02:33,887 --> 01:02:35,926
- Sophie.
- What?

1010
01:02:38,017 --> 01:02:41,385
Last night, you and Sky... What's wrong?

1011
01:02:43,647 --> 01:02:46,482
Tell me. Tell me what's wrong.

1012
01:02:50,904 --> 01:02:53,989
- I don't know what to do.
- You know what to do.

1013
01:02:57,703 --> 01:02:59,991
You don't have to do anything.

1014
01:03:02,124 --> 01:03:06,038
Not too late, I can still call off the wedding.
Everybody will understand.

1015
01:03:06,127 --> 01:03:08,333
Call... Call off the wedding?

1016
01:03:08,630 --> 01:03:10,753
- Isn't that what you want?
- No.

1017
01:03:11,508 --> 01:03:12,587
No.

1018
01:03:13,844 --> 01:03:15,836
No, that's what you want.

1019
01:03:16,346 --> 01:03:17,674
- No!
- Yes! God!

1020
01:03:17,764 --> 01:03:18,795
Sophie!

1021
01:03:18,890 --> 01:03:21,463
You just... You have no idea.

1022
01:03:21,559 --> 01:03:22,722
You never had a wedding.

1023
01:03:22,811 --> 01:03:24,638
You never did
the marriage-and-babies thing.

1024
01:03:24,730 --> 01:03:26,010
You just did the baby thing.

1025
01:03:26,106 --> 01:03:28,015
- Well, good for you.
- You know, I don't know why

1026
01:03:28,108 --> 01:03:31,773
- you're going off on me now! I really don't!
- Because I...

1027
01:03:32,487 --> 01:03:35,358
- God! I love Sky, and I want to be with him!
- Good! Great.

1028
01:03:35,448 --> 01:03:39,742
And I don't want my children growing up
not knowing who their father is.

1029
01:03:39,828 --> 01:03:42,035
Because it's just... It's crap!

1030
01:03:42,414 --> 01:03:45,368

1031
01:03:46,585 --> 01:03:49,539

Come on, man. What are you talking about?

1033
01:03:51,631 --> 01:03:55,760
Okay, okay, Sophie's gonna have
an absolutely beautiful wedding, right?

1034
01:03:56,387 --> 01:03:58,379
You're supposed to be helping me.

1035
01:03:58,472 --> 01:04:00,927
You guys... He's got to get ready.

1036
01:04:09,357 --> 01:04:11,600
I see you kept my bagpipes.

1037
01:04:14,446 --> 01:04:17,566
They're supposed to ward off
unwanted visitors.

1038
01:04:19,367 --> 01:04:22,202
Well, you don't need bagpipes to do that.

1039
01:04:23,246 --> 01:04:25,488
What are you doing here, Sam?

1040
01:04:25,790 --> 01:04:27,949
This is our dream, remember?

1041
01:04:29,294 --> 01:04:32,746
- Villa on the island?
- Yeah. Well, this is my reality.

1042
01:04:33,256 --> 01:04:36,257
Hard work and a crippling mortgage. Shoot!

1043
01:04:37,510 --> 01:04:40,962
And a hotel that's crumbling around me.

1044
01:04:41,055 --> 01:04:45,184
- Look, I'll help... Let me have a look at this...
- No, that's all right, I can

1045
01:04:45,269 --> 01:04:47,261
deal my own disasters.

1046
01:04:47,354 --> 01:04:50,520
Why didn't you tell me
it was Sophie getting married?

1047
01:04:50,607 --> 01:04:52,101
Well, I didn't think
it was any of your business.

1048
01:04:52,192 --> 01:04:54,268
Why is she getting married?
Settling down on the island?

1049
01:04:54,361 --> 01:04:57,445
I mean, if it was up to me,
I'd be telling her to go get a life.

1050
01:04:57,531 --> 01:04:59,274
- Yeah.
- She's a bright kid.

1051
01:04:59,366 --> 01:05:01,275
I know. I know.

1052
01:05:01,785 --> 01:05:04,537
But, you know, my daughter
has a mind of her own.

1053
01:05:04,871 --> 01:05:09,165
Oh, yeah. I see that. I see that.

1054
01:05:10,668 --> 01:05:12,661
- But she's so young.
- I know.

1055
01:05:13,130 --> 01:05:15,123
I mean, does she know
what she really wants?

1056
01:05:15,215 --> 01:05:18,300
You see, I think part of her
just wants to let you know

1057
01:05:18,385 --> 01:05:21,968
that she isn't going to leave you
alone here, on your own.

1058
01:05:24,307 --> 01:05:26,513
- What do you mean?
- Donna, look.

1059
01:05:26,601 --> 01:05:30,185
I have two grown children.
I know something about letting go.

1060
01:05:30,481 --> 01:05:32,141
If Sophie felt you were okay on your own,

1061
01:05:32,232 --> 01:05:34,640
would she want something different
for herself?

1062
01:05:34,735 --> 01:05:36,811
Okay, here's the thing.

1063
01:05:36,903 --> 01:05:39,940
I love being on my own. I really do.

1064
01:05:40,031 --> 01:05:42,071
You know, every morning,
I get up and I thank God

1065
01:05:42,158 --> 01:05:44,650
that I don't have some middle-aged,
menopausal man

1066
01:05:44,745 --> 01:05:46,369
telling me how to run my life.

1067
01:05:46,455 --> 01:05:49,160
You know, I'm free and I'm single.

1068
01:05:50,584 --> 01:05:52,872
And it's great.

1069
01:05:52,961 --> 01:05:53,992
* SOS *

1070
01:05:54,087 --> 01:05:58,416

They seem so hard to find</i>

1071
01:05:59,885 --> 01:06:03,930

1072

1073
01:06:09,853 --> 01:06:12,344
<i>I wish I understood</i>

1074
01:06:13,857 --> 01:06:18,436
<i>It used to be so nice
It used to be so good</i>

1075
01:06:21,698 --> 01:06:25,114

Can't you hear me?</i>

01:06:44,012 --> 01:06:48,924
<i>When you're gone, though I try
How can I carry on?</i>

1081
01:06:52,771 --> 01:06:57,598
<i>You seem so far away
though you are standing near</i>

1082
01:06:58,610 --> 01:07:03,522
<i>You made me feel alive
but something died, I fear</i>

1083
01:07:04,450 --> 01:07:08,032

01:07:08,245 --> 01:07:11,614

<i>- Though I try how can I carry on?
- Though I try how can I carry on?</i>

1094
01:08:10,682 --> 01:08:14,098
Donna must be tearing her hair out,
doing this wedding on her own.

1095
01:08:14,186 --> 01:08:16,937
What would the father of the bride
normally do?

1096
01:08:17,021 --> 01:08:21,352
Pay. Though my dad
drew the line at my third.

1097
01:08:21,694 --> 01:08:24,611
I see. Excuse me.

1098
01:08:25,822 --> 01:08:27,020
Harry?

1099
01:08:29,951 --> 01:08:31,114
Harry!

1100
01:08:31,870 --> 01:08:36,414
Tanya! Let's pick up
where we left off last night.

1101
01:08:36,917 --> 01:08:39,123
Last night never happened.

1102
01:08:39,211 --> 01:08:41,666
I've drawn a veil over last night.

1103
01:08:42,339 --> 01:08:44,960
Oh, my God. Look at the time.
I've got work to do.

1104
01:08:45,050 --> 01:08:47,588
- Work?
- A little repair and renovation.

1105
01:08:47,677 --> 01:08:51,427
Come on.
You don't mess with a masterpiece.

1106
01:08:51,515 --> 01:08:54,516
Oh, ignore him, Tanya,
he's all mouth and no trousers.

1107
01:08:54,601 --> 01:08:56,890
Tanya can't ignore the chemistry
between us.

1108
01:08:56,979 --> 01:09:00,513
Little boys who play with fire
get their fingers burned.

1109
01:09:00,982 --> 01:09:03,438
* DOES YOUR MO THER KNOW *

1110
01:09:07,031 --> 01:09:10,197
<i>You're so hot, teasing me</i>

1111
01:09:10,701 --> 01:09:15,742
<i>So you're blue
Well, I can't take a chance on a kid like you</i>

1112
01:09:17,332 --> 01:09:19,371
<i>It's something I couldn't do</i>

1113
01:09:22,379 --> 01:09:25,878
<i>There's that look in your eyes</i>

1114
01:09:26,091 --> 01:09:30,967
<i>I can read in your face
that your feelings are driving you wild</i>

1115
01:09:32,347 --> 01:09:34,553
<i>Oh, but, boy, you're only a child</i>

1116
01:09:37,060 --> 01:09:40,844
<i>Well, I can dance with you, honey
If you think it's funny</i>

1117
01:09:40,939 --> 01:09:43,609
<i>But does your mother know
that you're out?</i>

1118
01:09:44,234 --> 01:09:48,148
<i>And I can chat with you, baby
Flirt a little, maybe</i>

1119
01:09:48,238 --> 01:09:50,729
<i>Does your mother know
that you're out?</i>

1120
01:09:51,616 --> 01:09:55,116
<i>- Take it easy
- Take it easy. Better slow down, boy</i>

1121
01:09:55,204 --> 01:09:58,738
<i>That's no way to go
Does your mother know?</i>

1122
01:09:58,832 --> 01:10:02,283
<i>- Take it easy
- Take it easy. Try to cool it, boy</i>

1123
01:10:02,377 --> 01:10:05,876
<i>Play it nice and slow
Does your mother know?</i>

1124
01:10:12,596 --> 01:10:14,304
Come on, boy.

1125
01:10:20,729 --> 01:10:23,646
<i>I can see what you want</i>

1126
01:10:24,316 --> 01:10:29,144
<i>But you seem pretty young
To be searching for that kind of fun</i>

1127
01:10:30,822 --> 01:10:32,815
<i>So maybe I'm not the one</i>

1128
01:10:35,702 --> 01:10:39,153
<i>Now you're so cute
I like your style</i>

1129
01:10:39,539 --> 01:10:45,293
<i>And I know what you mean
When you give me a flash of that smile</i>

1130
01:10:45,837 --> 01:10:48,507
<i>But, boy, you're only a child</i>

1131
01:10:50,467 --> 01:10:54,511
<i>Well, I can dance with you, honey
If you think it's funny</i>

1132
01:10:54,596 --> 01:10:57,004
<i>Does your mother know
that you're out?</i>

1133
01:10:57,725 --> 01:11:01,592
<i>And I can chat with you, baby
Flirt a little, maybe</i>

1134
01:11:01,728 --> 01:11:04,184
<i>Does your mother know that you're out?</i>

1135
01:11:04,856 --> 01:11:08,854
<i>Well, I can dance with you, honey
If you think it's funny</i>

1136
01:11:08,943 --> 01:11:11,352
<i>Does your mother know that you're out?</i>

1137
01:11:12,072 --> 01:11:16,022
<i>And I can chat with you, baby
Flirt a little, maybe</i>

1138
01:11:16,118 --> 01:11:18,525
<i>Does your mother know that you're out?</i>

1139
01:11:19,621 --> 01:11:22,538
<i>Does your mother know that you're out?</i>

1140
01:11:23,208 --> 01:11:25,414
<i>Does your mother know that you're out?</i>

1141
01:11:25,502 --> 01:11:29,286
<i>Does your mother know?
Does your mother know that you're out?</i>

1142
01:11:33,885 --> 01:11:36,720
Boy down! Boy down!

1143
01:11:36,805 --> 01:11:39,971
Yo, girls. We done good.

1144
01:11:41,601 --> 01:11:43,393
Yes, any colour. Doesn't matter.

1145
01:11:43,479 --> 01:11:46,645
There's no plan,
God knows there's no plan.

1146
01:11:46,732 --> 01:11:48,771
<i>- It looks great, though.
- Ella, Donna, where would you like this?</i>

1147
01:11:48,859 --> 01:11:51,813
Carlos, get the meat out of the heat.

1148
01:11:51,903 --> 01:11:56,066
Put a cover on that thing. That's beautiful.
And tell... lone, help him get the...

1149
01:11:56,157 --> 01:11:59,112
- Harry, what are you doing here?
- Hello.

1150
01:11:59,203 --> 01:12:01,112
I just wanted to give you this.

1151
01:12:01,205 --> 01:12:02,996
I don't mean here, here.

1152
01:12:03,081 --> 01:12:07,245
- I mean, why are you on this island?
- I realised...

1153
01:12:07,335 --> 01:12:09,873
What is this?

1154
01:12:09,963 --> 01:12:13,463
Now, I realised you'll have had to
tighten your belt a bit over the years,

1155
01:12:13,551 --> 01:12:15,590
bringing up Sophie on your own,

1156
01:12:15,677 --> 01:12:19,093
and I just wanted to make
a small contribution to the wedding.

1157
01:12:23,226 --> 01:12:26,429
- I can't accept this. I can't...
- No. No.

1158
01:12:26,813 --> 01:12:28,188
- Harry, I can't.
- No. No.

1159
01:12:28,273 --> 01:12:31,274
- Harry? I can't...
- No, you'll have to catch me first.

1160
01:12:32,820 --> 01:12:35,310
- Sky.
- What's the matter?

1161
01:12:35,530 --> 01:12:38,068
- You have to help me.
- Why, what's happened?

1162
01:12:38,617 --> 01:12:39,648
Baby?

1163
01:12:40,910 --> 01:12:42,108
Sophie!

1164
01:12:42,996 --> 01:12:44,110
Soph.

1165
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,621
I've done something completely insane.

1166
01:12:49,336 --> 01:12:52,206
All my dads are here for our wedding,
and they all think they're giving me away.

1167
01:12:52,297 --> 01:12:53,791
All your what?

1168
01:12:55,216 --> 01:12:59,380
I read Mom's diary,
and I have three possible fathers.

1169
01:13:00,681 --> 01:13:02,804
But how are they here now?

1170
01:13:03,142 --> 01:13:04,719
I invited them.

1171
01:13:06,645 --> 01:13:08,554
I thought that I would know my dad
right away,

1172
01:13:08,647 --> 01:13:10,307
but I didn't. I just...

1173
01:13:10,398 --> 01:13:12,972
I have no idea.
And now, my mom is gonna kill me,

1174
01:13:13,067 --> 01:13:15,394
- and they're gonna hate me, and you...
- Hold on. Hold on.

1175
01:13:15,487 --> 01:13:17,610
You invited these guys
and you didn't tell me?

1176
01:13:17,698 --> 01:13:20,402
No, I thought you would try to stop me.

1177
01:13:21,743 --> 01:13:23,950
- I know I messed up.
- Sophie?

1178
01:13:25,497 --> 01:13:27,952
Is that what this whole
big white wedding is about?

1179
01:13:28,041 --> 01:13:30,829
- You finding your dad?
- No. No!

1180
01:13:30,920 --> 01:13:33,375
I wanted to take a boat to the mainland
with a couple of witnesses.

1181
01:13:33,464 --> 01:13:36,334
And you insisted on this sodding circus
so you could play Happy Families.

1182
01:13:36,425 --> 01:13:39,758
It's about knowing who I am. And I wanted
to get married knowing who I am.

1183
01:13:39,845 --> 01:13:42,715
That doesn't come from finding your father,

1184
01:13:43,098 --> 01:13:45,505
that comes from finding yourself.

1185
01:13:46,769 --> 01:13:50,019
And the irony is,
I was travelling to find myself.

1186
01:13:51,398 --> 01:13:53,853
I put everything on hold for you.

1187
01:13:56,194 --> 01:13:58,685
Because I loved you
and I wanted what you wanted.

1188
01:13:58,780 --> 01:14:00,191
Now, I don't know.

1189
01:14:00,865 --> 01:14:02,111
You don't know if you love me?

1190
01:14:02,201 --> 01:14:05,285
Of course I love you.
I just wish you'd told me.

1191
01:14:07,039 --> 01:14:08,782
Is everything okay?

1192
01:14:09,708 --> 01:14:11,747
- Sophie, what's wrong?
- Not now, Sam.

1193
01:14:11,835 --> 01:14:13,412
Yes, yes, yes, now.

1194
01:14:13,503 --> 01:14:15,579
Because I'm supposed to be
giving you away.

1195
01:14:15,672 --> 01:14:17,749
And how can I when I know
you're not really gonna be happy?

1196
01:14:17,841 --> 01:14:21,008
I've heard all this from my mother, and
I think she knows me better than you do.

1197
01:14:21,095 --> 01:14:23,929
I know. But I've done the big white wedding,
and believe me,

1198
01:14:24,014 --> 01:14:27,714
- it doesn't always end in "happy ever after."
- That is you. That's not me.

1199
01:14:27,809 --> 01:14:30,596
Okay? I love Sky more than anything
in the world. And I...

1200
01:14:31,855 --> 01:14:34,773
Did you feel that way
before you got married?

1201
01:14:36,610 --> 01:14:37,689
No.

1202
01:14:54,336 --> 01:14:57,669
Hey, aren't you supposed to be
getting dressed?

1203
01:14:57,756 --> 01:15:00,875
Where's Ali and Lisa?
I thought they were going to help you.

1204
01:15:00,967 --> 01:15:02,592
Will you help me?

1205
01:15:03,761 --> 01:15:04,794
Mmm-hmm.

1206
01:15:07,141 --> 01:15:11,055
Wait. It's okay, it's okay.

1207
01:15:11,228 --> 01:15:12,936
We have time.

1208
01:15:14,940 --> 01:15:16,813
* SLIPPING THROUGH MY FINGERS *

1209
01:15:16,900 --> 01:15:19,937
<i>Schoolbag in hand</i>

1210
01:15:20,029 --> 01:15:24,774
<i>She leaves home in the early morning</i>

1211
01:15:24,867 --> 01:15:26,824
<i>Waving goodbye</i>

1212
01:15:26,910 --> 01:15:32,450
<i>With an absent-minded smile</i>

1213
01:15:32,540 --> 01:15:35,293
<i>I watch her go</i>

1214
01:15:35,377 --> 01:15:39,754
<i>With a surge of that well-known sadness</i>

1215
01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:45,261
<i>And I have to sit down for a while</i>

1216
01:15:45,804 --> 01:15:49,386
<i>The feeling that I'm losing her</i>

1217
01:15:49,474 --> 01:15:52,760
<i>Forever</i>

1218
01:15:52,853 --> 01:15:58,973
<i>And without really entering her world</i>

1219
01:15:59,067 --> 01:16:04,488
<i>I'm glad whenever I can share her laughter</i>

1220
01:16:04,614 --> 01:16:09,158
<i>That funny little girl</i>

1221
01:16:09,286 --> 01:16:12,702
<i>Slipping through my fingers all the time</i>

1222
01:16:12,789 --> 01:16:17,416
<i>I try to capture every minute</i>

1223
01:16:17,502 --> 01:16:23,007
<i>The feeling in it
Slipping through my fingers all the time</i>

1224
01:16:23,092 --> 01:16:26,009
<i>Do I really see what's in her mind?</i>

1225
01:16:26,094 --> 01:16:31,089
<i>Each time I think I'm close to knowing</i>

1226
01:16:31,183 --> 01:16:33,305
<i>She keeps on growing</i>

1227
01:16:33,393 --> 01:16:39,313
<i>Slipping through my fingers all the time</i>

1228
01:16:39,400 --> 01:16:42,235
<i>Sleep in our eyes</i>

1229
01:16:42,319 --> 01:16:47,028
<i>Her and me at the breakfast table</i>

1230
01:16:47,115 --> 01:16:49,024
<i>Barely awake</i>

1231
01:16:49,117 --> 01:16:54,741
<i>I let precious time go by</i>

1232
01:16:54,832 --> 01:17:01,629
<i>Then when she's gone
There's that odd melancholy feeling</i>

1233
01:17:01,713 --> 01:17:08,380
<i>And a sense of guilt I can't deny</i>

1234
01:17:08,469 --> 01:17:15,054
<i>What happened to
those wonderful adventures</i>

1235
01:17:15,143 --> 01:17:19,639
<i>The places I had planned for us to go</i>

1236
01:17:19,731 --> 01:17:21,605
<i>Slipping through my fingers all the time</i>

1237
01:17:21,691 --> 01:17:24,693
<i>Well, some of that we did</i>

1238
01:17:24,778 --> 01:17:27,352
<i>But most we didn't</i>

1239
01:17:27,448 --> 01:17:31,527
<i>And why, I just don't know</i>

1240
01:17:31,702 --> 01:17:34,536
<i>Slipping through my fingers all the time</i>

1241
01:17:34,621 --> 01:17:39,782
<i>I try to capture every minute</i>

1242
01:17:39,877 --> 01:17:45,416
<i>The feeling in it
Slipping through my fingers all the time</i>

1243
01:17:45,507 --> 01:17:48,342
<i>Do I really see what's in her mind?</i>

1244
01:17:48,426 --> 01:17:53,503
<i>Each time I think I'm close to knowing</i>

1245
01:17:53,598 --> 01:17:55,638
<i>She keeps on growing</i>

1246
01:17:55,726 --> 01:18:01,100
<i>Slipping through my fingers all the time</i>

1247
01:18:09,364 --> 01:18:11,488
Do you think I'm letting you down?

1248
01:18:13,702 --> 01:18:16,407
Why would you even think that?

1249
01:18:16,496 --> 01:18:19,414
Well, because of what you've done.

1250
01:18:19,499 --> 01:18:22,583
I mean, the Dynamos, raising a kid,

1251
01:18:22,669 --> 01:18:24,994
and running a business all on your own.

1252
01:18:25,129 --> 01:18:28,215
Well, honey, I didn't have a choice.

1253
01:18:28,300 --> 01:18:30,969
I couldn't go home, you know.

1254
01:18:32,763 --> 01:18:37,970
When I got pregnant, my mother told me
not to bother coming back.

1255
01:18:40,478 --> 01:18:43,148
And I wouldn't have had it any other way.

1256
01:18:43,232 --> 01:18:45,639
My God, look at what we've had.

1257
01:18:50,447 --> 01:18:52,320
Will you give me away?

1258
01:19:02,251 --> 01:19:03,282
Yeah.

1259
01:19:07,214 --> 01:19:09,040
<i>Sometimes I wish</i>

1260
01:19:09,132 --> 01:19:14,471
<i>That I could freeze the picture</i>

1261
01:19:14,555 --> 01:19:18,683
<i>And save it from the funny tricks of time</i>

1262
01:19:18,850 --> 01:19:23,761
<i>Slipping through my fingers</i>

1263
01:19:55,845 --> 01:19:58,716
<i>Schoolbag in hand</i>

1264
01:19:58,806 --> 01:20:03,683
<i>She leaves home in the early morning</i>

1265
01:20:03,770 --> 01:20:05,893
<i>Waving goodbye</i>

1266
01:20:05,981 --> 01:20:12,600
<i>With an absent-minded smile</i>

1267
01:20:19,036 --> 01:20:20,067
Donna!

1268
01:20:20,954 --> 01:20:23,825
Donna. I need to talk to you about
who's giving Sophie away.

1269
01:20:23,915 --> 01:20:25,908
- That would be me.
- But...

1270
01:20:26,001 --> 01:20:28,705
- What about her dad?
- Her dad isn't here.

1271
01:20:28,795 --> 01:20:32,580
It's what she wants.
She told me she wants her father here.

1272
01:20:32,758 --> 01:20:37,087
- What if her father wants that, too?
- What? Sam, don't do this now.

1273
01:20:37,179 --> 01:20:40,345
I can't hear this now!

1274
01:20:40,432 --> 01:20:44,050
Donna, listen to me. This is about us.

1275
01:20:44,144 --> 01:20:45,175
* THE WINNER TAKES IT ALL *

1276
01:20:45,270 --> 01:20:46,931
<i>I don't wanna talk</i>

1277
01:20:48,816 --> 01:20:51,104
<i>About things we've gone through</i>

1278
01:20:52,444 --> 01:20:54,353
<i>Though it's hurting me</i>

1279
01:20:56,031 --> 01:20:58,272
<i>Now it's history</i>

1280
01:21:00,034 --> 01:21:03,120
<i>I've played all my cards</i>

1281
01:21:04,123 --> 01:21:07,871
<i>And that's what you've done, too</i>

1282
01:21:07,960 --> 01:21:11,209
<i>Nothing more to say</i>

1283
01:21:11,296 --> 01:21:14,048
<i>No more ace to play</i>

1284
01:21:15,467 --> 01:21:19,299
<i>The winner takes it all</i>

1285
01:21:19,388 --> 01:21:23,088
<i>The loser standing small</i>

1286
01:21:23,183 --> 01:21:27,050
<i>Beside the victory</i>

1287
01:21:27,145 --> 01:21:31,273
<i>That's her destiny</i>

1288
01:21:31,357 --> 01:21:35,023
<i>I was in your arms</i>

1289
01:21:35,112 --> 01:21:38,563
<i>Thinking I belonged there</i>

1290
01:21:38,657 --> 01:21:42,156
<i>I figured it made sense</i>

1291
01:21:42,244 --> 01:21:45,161
<i>Building me a fence</i>

1292
01:21:46,581 --> 01:21:50,330
<i>Building me a home</i>

1293
01:21:50,461 --> 01:21:54,161
<i>Thinking I'd be strong there</i>

1294
01:21:54,256 --> 01:21:56,332
<i>But I was a fool</i>

1295
01:21:57,592 --> 01:22:01,590
<i>Playing by the rules</i>

1296
01:22:01,679 --> 01:22:05,429
<i>The gods may throw the dice</i>

1297
01:22:05,517 --> 01:22:09,266
<i>Their minds as cold as ice</i>

1298
01:22:09,354 --> 01:22:13,103
<i>And someone way down here</i>

1299
01:22:13,191 --> 01:22:16,940
<i>Loses someone dear</i>

1300
01:22:17,028 --> 01:22:20,694
<i>The winner takes it all</i>

1301
01:22:20,783 --> 01:22:24,483
<i>The loser has to fall</i>

1302
01:22:24,578 --> 01:22:28,362
<i>It's simple and it's plain</i>

1303
01:22:28,457 --> 01:22:32,454
<i>Why should I complain?</i>

1304
01:22:32,544 --> 01:22:36,293
<i>But tell me does she kiss</i>

1305
01:22:36,382 --> 01:22:39,964
<i>Like I used to kiss you?</i>

1306
01:22:40,052 --> 01:22:43,717
<i>Does it feel the same</i>

1307
01:22:43,805 --> 01:22:47,672
<i>When she calls your name?</i>

1308
01:22:47,767 --> 01:22:51,718
<i>Somewhere deep inside</i>

1309
01:22:51,814 --> 01:22:55,182
<i>You must know I miss you</i>

1310
01:22:55,275 --> 01:22:57,102
<i>But what can I say?</i>

1311
01:22:58,779 --> 01:23:02,562
<i>Rules must be obeyed</i>

1312
01:23:02,657 --> 01:23:06,442
<i>The judges will decide</i>

1313
01:23:06,537 --> 01:23:10,321
<i>The likes of me abide</i>

1314
01:23:10,415 --> 01:23:14,247
<i>Spectators at the show</i>

1315
01:23:14,336 --> 01:23:17,918
<i>Always staying low</i>

1316
01:23:18,006 --> 01:23:21,671
<i>The game is on again</i>

1317
01:23:21,759 --> 01:23:25,509
<i>A lover or a friend</i>

1318
01:23:25,597 --> 01:23:29,346
<i>A big thing or a small</i>

1319
01:23:29,434 --> 01:23:33,895
<i>The winner takes it all</i>

1320
01:23:35,440 --> 01:23:37,433
<i>I don't wanna talk</i>

1321
01:23:39,111 --> 01:23:41,684
<i>'Cause it makes me feel sad</i>

1322
01:23:42,990 --> 01:23:45,278
<i>And I understand</i>

1323
01:23:46,660 --> 01:23:48,818
<i>You've come to shake my hand</i>

1324
01:23:50,622 --> 01:23:54,454
<i>I apologise</i>

1325
01:23:54,543 --> 01:23:58,126
<i>If it makes you feel bad</i>

1326
01:23:58,213 --> 01:24:00,834
<i>Seeing me so tense</i>

1327
01:24:01,466 --> 01:24:05,214
<i>No self-confidence, but you see</i>

1328
01:24:05,303 --> 01:24:09,218
<i>The winner takes it all</i>

1329
01:24:12,811 --> 01:24:19,478
<i>The winner takes it all</i>

1330
01:24:20,819 --> 01:24:23,985
<i>The game is on again</i>

1331
01:24:24,072 --> 01:24:27,821
<i>A lover or a friend</i>

1332
01:24:27,910 --> 01:24:31,528
<i>A big thing or a small</i>

1333
01:24:31,621 --> 01:24:36,746
<i>The winner takes it all</i>

1334
01:24:37,168 --> 01:24:43,254
<i>So the winner takes it all</i>

1335
01:24:44,551 --> 01:24:50,803
<i>And the loser has to fall</i>

1336
01:24:52,142 --> 01:24:58,644
<i>So the winner takes it all</i>

1337
01:24:59,650 --> 01:25:05,522
<i>And the loser has to fall</i>

1338
01:25:05,614 --> 01:25:07,191
Donna!

1339
01:25:08,366 --> 01:25:12,281
<i>The winner takes it</i>

1340
01:25:14,331 --> 01:25:20,203
<i>All</i>

1341
01:25:37,020 --> 01:25:39,725
Donna, there you are.

1342
01:25:40,064 --> 01:25:42,058
- It's okay.
- They're my best shoes.

1343
01:25:42,151 --> 01:25:44,558
Panic over! Here she is.
She's here.

1344
01:25:44,653 --> 01:25:47,773
- Oh, don't worry.
- Oh, God.

1345
01:26:36,621 --> 01:26:37,784
I love you.

1346
01:26:43,586 --> 01:26:45,876
Welcome to Sophie and Sky,

1347
01:26:45,964 --> 01:26:49,665
and to all your friends
who have gathered together this evening.

1348
01:26:49,927 --> 01:26:54,138
And welcome, especially, to Donna,
who represents your family.

1349
01:26:54,222 --> 01:26:56,215
We are all here together in this

1350
01:26:56,307 --> 01:26:59,642
- glorious...
- And welcome to...

1351
01:26:59,728 --> 01:27:01,139
To

1352
01:27:01,230 --> 01:27:02,605
Sophie's dad.

1353
01:27:03,899 --> 01:27:07,433
- I have to tell you. He is here.
- I know. I invited him.

1354
01:27:09,654 --> 01:27:12,026
You couldn't have.
I don't know which one it is.

1355
01:27:15,118 --> 01:27:16,494
Oh, my God.

1356
01:27:17,538 --> 01:27:20,574
- That's why they're all here!
- I'm sorry. Sorry. I just...

1357
01:27:20,666 --> 01:27:24,200
Please, please forgive me!
Please forgive me. Please.

1358
01:27:24,294 --> 01:27:26,002
I don't know.

1359
01:27:28,840 --> 01:27:31,248
- Can you forgive me?
- What?

1360
01:27:32,177 --> 01:27:35,760
I don't care if you slept with
hundreds of men.

1361
01:27:37,349 --> 01:27:40,682
You're my mom, and I love you so much.

1362
01:27:42,687 --> 01:27:44,347
Oh, Soph.

1363
01:27:47,359 --> 01:27:50,562
And I haven't slept with hundreds of men.

1364
01:27:54,366 --> 01:27:57,485
Am I getting this right?

1365
01:27:57,577 --> 01:28:02,619
Sophie may be mine,
but she may be Bill's or Harry's?

1366
01:28:02,708 --> 01:28:06,373
Yeah, yeah. That's right.
And don't get all self-righteous with me,

1367
01:28:06,461 --> 01:28:09,166
because you have
no one but yourself to blame.

1368
01:28:09,256 --> 01:28:13,419
Yeah, if you hadn't just dumped my mother
and gone off and married somebody else...

1369
01:28:13,510 --> 01:28:18,089
Hey, hey, wait a minute!
I had to go home. I was engaged.

1370
01:28:18,182 --> 01:28:21,551
But I told Lorraine I couldn't marry her,
and I came right back.

1371
01:28:25,105 --> 01:28:27,144
You... You...

1372
01:28:28,566 --> 01:28:30,808
- Why didn't you call me?
- Because I was crazy enough

1373
01:28:30,902 --> 01:28:32,479
to think that you would be waiting for me.

1374
01:28:32,570 --> 01:28:36,154
Only when I arrived, they told me
you were off with some other guy.

1375
01:28:38,827 --> 01:28:43,204
So, Lorraine called me an idiot
and married me to prove it.

1376
01:28:43,331 --> 01:28:45,371
Sorry, can I just... Might I just butt in?

1377
01:28:45,458 --> 01:28:47,415
Oh, Harry, don't... It's all right.
You don't have to.

1378
01:28:47,502 --> 01:28:52,330
No, no, I just wanted to say it's great
to have even a third of Sophie.

1379
01:28:52,424 --> 01:28:55,591
I never thought I'd get
even that much of a child.

1380
01:28:55,802 --> 01:28:58,756
Donna, you were the first girl I ever loved.

1381
01:28:59,681 --> 01:29:02,966
Well, actually, you were
the last girl I ever loved.

1382
01:29:04,520 --> 01:29:07,770
Now, this gives me an excuse
to come here much more often.

1383
01:29:07,856 --> 01:29:10,857
We can find out if you want,

1384
01:29:11,193 --> 01:29:13,102
but I'm with Harry.

1385
01:29:14,029 --> 01:29:17,812
- Being a third of your dad is great by me.
- By me, too.

1386
01:29:17,907 --> 01:29:19,318
I'll take a third.

1387
01:29:19,409 --> 01:29:23,953
Typical, isn't it? You wait 20 years for a dad,
and then three come along at once.

1388
01:29:27,793 --> 01:29:28,955
Dearly beloved...

1389
01:29:29,044 --> 01:29:34,916
You know, I have no clue which one of you
is my dad, but I don't mind.

1390
01:29:35,593 --> 01:29:38,463
Now, I know what I really want.

1391
01:29:38,554 --> 01:29:40,214
Sky, let's just not get married yet.

1392
01:29:40,305 --> 01:29:42,179
- What?
- What?

1393
01:29:43,558 --> 01:29:45,634
You never wanted this anyway.

1394
01:29:45,727 --> 01:29:50,554
I know that. Let's just get off this island
and just see the world. Okay? All right?

1395
01:29:50,648 --> 01:29:52,060
I love you.

1396
01:29:59,157 --> 01:30:02,360
Donna, do I take it the wedding
is cancelled?

1397
01:30:03,036 --> 01:30:05,657
I'm not entirely sure
what's happening right now.

1398
01:30:05,747 --> 01:30:07,290
Hang on.

1399
01:30:09,877 --> 01:30:11,869
Why waste a good wedding?

1400
01:30:14,005 --> 01:30:15,915
How about it, Sheridan?

1401
01:30:16,508 --> 01:30:20,671
You're going to need someone
to boss around on this island of yours.

1402
01:30:21,512 --> 01:30:26,175
Are you nuts? I am not a bigamist.

1403
01:30:26,268 --> 01:30:31,345
Neither am I. I'm a divorced man
who's loved you for 21 years,

1404
01:30:32,691 --> 01:30:35,395
and ever since the day
I set foot on this island,

1405
01:30:35,485 --> 01:30:38,652
I've been trying to tell you
how much I love you.

1406
01:30:46,580 --> 01:30:51,040
Come on, Donna.
It's only the rest of your life.

1407
01:30:52,126 --> 01:30:54,085
* I DO, I DO, I DO, I DO, I DO *

1408
01:30:54,171 --> 01:30:59,378
<i>I can't conceal it
Don't you see?</i>

1409
01:30:59,468 --> 01:31:02,172
<i>Can't you feel it?</i>

1410
01:31:03,847 --> 01:31:05,720
<i>Say I do</i>

1411
01:31:05,807 --> 01:31:06,838
Oh, yeah.

1412
01:31:06,933 --> 01:31:11,845
<i>I do, I do, I do, I do, I do</i>

1413
01:31:13,607 --> 01:31:16,608
<i>Donna, please show it</i>

1414
01:31:16,693 --> 01:31:21,355
<i>You love me
And you know it</i>

1415
01:31:21,448 --> 01:31:24,021
<i>Say I do</i>

1416
01:31:26,078 --> 01:31:27,537
<i>I do</i>

1417
01:31:28,205 --> 01:31:31,241
I do, I do,

1418
01:31:31,333 --> 01:31:34,702
I do, I do.

1419
01:31:40,968 --> 01:31:45,594
I now pronounce you man and wife.

1420
01:31:54,147 --> 01:31:55,725
I'm so happy!

1421
01:32:03,573 --> 01:32:06,242
* WHEN ALL IS SAID AND DONE *

1422
01:32:18,672 --> 01:32:22,123
<i>Here's to us
One more toast</i>

1423
01:32:22,342 --> 01:32:26,755
<i>And then we'll pay the bill</i>

1424
01:32:26,847 --> 01:32:30,430
<i>Deep inside both of us</i>

1425
01:32:30,517 --> 01:32:34,680
<i>Could feel the autumn chill</i>

1426
01:32:35,105 --> 01:32:38,604
<i>Birds of passage
You and me</i>

1427
01:32:38,691 --> 01:32:42,144
<i>We fly instinctively</i>

1428
01:32:43,280 --> 01:32:46,447
<i>When the summer's over</i>

1429
01:32:46,533 --> 01:32:50,400
<i>And the dark clouds hide the sun</i>

1430
01:32:51,663 --> 01:32:55,281
<i>Neither you nor I'm to blame</i>

1431
01:32:55,375 --> 01:32:58,958
<i>When all is said and done</i>

1432
01:33:06,303 --> 01:33:09,718
<i>In our lives
We have walked</i>

1433
01:33:09,806 --> 01:33:12,890
<i>Some strange and Ionely treks</i>

1434
01:33:12,977 --> 01:33:14,175
Yeah.

1435
01:33:14,269 --> 01:33:16,262
<i>Slightly worn</i>

1436
01:33:16,355 --> 01:33:18,146
<i>but dignified</i>

1437
01:33:18,232 --> 01:33:21,268
<i>And not too old for sex</i>

1438
01:33:21,359 --> 01:33:22,735
Yeah!

1439
01:33:22,819 --> 01:33:26,402
<i>Clear-headed and open-eyed</i>

1440
01:33:26,489 --> 01:33:29,859
<i>With nothing left untried</i>

1441
01:33:30,911 --> 01:33:35,122
<i>Standing calmly at the crossroads</i>

1442
01:33:35,207 --> 01:33:38,124
<i>No desire to run</i>

1443
01:33:39,294 --> 01:33:42,959
<i>There's no hurry any more</i>

1444
01:33:43,047 --> 01:33:46,464

<i>And done</i>

1450
01:34:13,578 --> 01:34:19,332
That's not for me. I'm a writer. Lone wolf.

<i>If you change your mind</i>

1452
01:34:32,890 --> 01:34:34,929

Speech!

1461
01:35:03,962 --> 01:35:06,085
I'm gonna make a speech, everybody.

1462
01:35:06,173 --> 01:35:07,501

<i>Gonna do my very best

<i>Maybe just talking</i>

1475
01:35:52,136 --> 01:35:54,591

So much that I wanna do</i>

<i>It's magic</i>

1479
01:36:04,023 --> 01:36:07,806
<i>- You want me to leave it there
- Afraid of a love affair</i>

1480
01:36:07,901 --> 01:36:12,278
<i>But I think you know</i>

1481
01:36:12,364 --> 01:36:15,697

- Let's give it to them!
- You want another one?

1549
01:41:33,977 --> 01:41:35,057
Let's rip it up!

1550
01:41:35,145 --> 01:41:37,850
* WATERLOO *

1551
01:41:40,942 --> 01:41:47,444
<i>My, my, at Waterloo
Napoleon did surrender</i>

1552
01:41:47,533 --> 01:41:52,278
<i>Oh, yeah
And I have met my destiny</i>

1553
01:41:52,371 --> 01:41:54,944
<i>In quite a similar way</i>

1554
01:41:55,749 --> 01:41:58,952
<i>The history book on the shelf</i>

1555
01:41:59,085 --> 01:42:03,664
<i>Is always repeating itself</i>

1556
01:42:04,258 --> 01:42:08,800
<i>Waterloo
I was defeated, you won the war</i>

1557
01:42:10,805 --> 01:42:14,969
<i>Waterloo
Promise to love you for ever more</i>

1558
01:42:17,313 --> 01:42:21,524
<i>Waterloo
Couldn't escape if I wanted to</i>

1559
01:42:23,860 --> 01:42:28,107
<i>Waterloo
Knowing my fate is to be with you</i>

1560
01:42:30,366 --> 01:42:34,614
<i>Waterloo
Finally facing my Waterloo</i>

1561
01:42:36,665 --> 01:42:39,832
<i>And how could I ever refuse</i>

1562
01:42:39,918 --> 01:42:43,203
<i>I feel like I win when I lose</i>

1563
01:42:43,505 --> 01:42:48,048
<i>Waterloo
I was defeated, you won the war</i>

1564
01:42:50,012 --> 01:42:54,259
<i>Waterloo
Promise to love you for ever more</i>

1565
01:42:56,518 --> 01:43:00,350
<i>Waterloo
Couldn't escape if I wanted to</i>

1566
01:43:03,024 --> 01:43:07,402
<i>Waterloo
Knowing my fate is to be with you</i>

1567
01:43:09,615 --> 01:43:13,826
<i>Waterloo
Finally facing my Waterloo</i>

1568
01:43:16,204 --> 01:43:21,661
<i>Waterloo
Finally facing my Waterloo</i>
