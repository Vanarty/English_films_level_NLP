00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:15,083
So what are you gonna do?

174
00:07:15,118 --> 00:07:16,167
The only thing I can do.

175
00:07:16,219 --> 00:07:17,385
Get Harvey to ask me
for something else.

176
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:18,553
No, not an option.

177
00:07:18,588 --> 00:07:20,355
Donna, the only way
I can get this done

178
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:22,140
is with Jack Soloff's help,
and there is no way

179
00:07:22,175 --> 00:07:23,992
that he's gonna reverse
the very same proposal

180
00:07:24,027 --> 00:07:26,161
that put him on the map.

181
00:07:26,349 --> 00:07:27,826
I'll tell you
what Harvey would do.

182
00:07:27,878 --> 00:07:30,395
I don't care
what Harvey would do,

183
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:32,614
because I cannot do
what Harvey would do.

184
00:07:33,101 --> 00:07:34,467
What would Harvey do?

185
00:07:34,502 --> 00:07:36,669
He'd find a way to make it
worth Jack's while.

186
00:07:39,941 --> 00:07:42,175
Get Rachel to get me a list
of every major corporate merger

187
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:44,694
pending in the next month.

188
00:07:44,729 --> 00:07:46,579
There is the Louis
I came to work for.

189
00:07:46,581 --> 00:07:49,215
You are right. Here I am.
And I'm gonna get it done.

190
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:52,351
And when I do, you and I are
going for a long, slow mud.

191
00:07:52,387 --> 00:07:54,453
No, we're not.

192
00:08:00,285 --> 00:08:01,384
If you're here to check the air,

193
00:08:01,419 --> 00:08:03,119
it's like a sauna
on the 38th floor.

194
00:08:03,155 --> 00:08:04,254
Good to see you, Harvey.

195
00:08:04,289 --> 00:08:05,989
Nice to know some people
never change.

196
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:07,457
No witty rejoinder?
What's going on?

197
00:08:07,492 --> 00:08:08,658
You slowing down
in your old age?

198
00:08:08,693 --> 00:08:09,759
Could be low T.

199
00:08:09,794 --> 00:08:11,828
And I could talk shit
with guys all day,

200
00:08:11,863 --> 00:08:13,767
but I'm here because
I care about my client.

201
00:08:13,768 --> 00:08:14,851
Well, then maybe your client
shouldn't have tried

202
00:08:14,886 --> 00:08:16,649
to launch a company
with stolen IP.

203
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:19,685
That IP wasn't stolen.
Alyssa created it herself.

204
00:08:19,687 --> 00:08:21,567
It doesn't matter whether
she created it or not.

205
00:08:21,589 --> 00:08:23,889
She signed a contract
that says we own it,

206
00:08:23,924 --> 00:08:26,959
and it was on our laptop that
she took home on her last day.

207
00:08:26,994 --> 00:08:29,027
And we're not letting you walk
out the door with our property.

208
00:08:29,063 --> 00:08:30,796
Okay, I told you
this isn't about me.

209
00:08:30,831 --> 00:08:31,763
Okay, what do you want, Tanner?

210
00:08:31,815 --> 00:08:32,898
I want to make an offer.

211
00:08:33,354 --> 00:08:35,521
Alyssa is willing
to give you a 15% stake

212
00:08:35,557 --> 00:08:37,023
to drop this whole thing.

213
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:38,425
She could make it 100%
for all I care.

214
00:08:38,427 --> 00:08:39,976
- We're not settling.
- You don't have to settle,

215
00:08:40,028 --> 00:08:42,212
but you do have to present
that offer to your client

216
00:08:42,247 --> 00:08:43,363
and you know it.

217
00:08:43,398 --> 00:08:44,698
I will, I just need
to get it translated

218
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:46,533
from bullshit to English.

219
00:08:46,568 --> 00:08:48,535
Harvey, look at me.
That's a fair offer.

220
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:50,403
No, you look at me and tell me
you're not doing something

221
00:08:50,439 --> 00:08:52,188
behind our backs right now.

222
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,673
- I'm not.
- Well, we are.

223
00:08:53,709 --> 00:08:55,642
Your secretary said
you wouldn't file a TRO

224
00:08:55,677 --> 00:08:56,677
until after this meeting.

225
00:08:56,678 --> 00:08:57,861
Oh, we didn't.

226
00:08:57,896 --> 00:08:59,946
Turns out that Miss Lang
has some outstanding debts,

227
00:08:59,982 --> 00:09:01,715
so we just went ahead
and bought those up

228
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,483
and put a lien on her property.

229
00:09:04,061 --> 00:09:06,195
The sheriff's padlocking
her offices as we speak.

230
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:08,364
Harvey, don't do this.
You'll be sorry.

231
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:09,498
Tell that to the judge.

232
00:09:09,534 --> 00:09:11,500
We're filing that TRO
in the morning.

233
00:09:16,173 --> 00:09:19,708
I'm telling you,
I'm not the guy I used to be,

234
00:09:19,744 --> 00:09:22,628
but if you hit me,
I'm not turning the other cheek.

235
00:09:22,663 --> 00:09:24,797
You're gonna get hit back.

236
00:09:29,923 --> 00:09:31,355
What are you so happy about?

237
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:33,424
I told you,
it's exactly what I needed.

238
00:09:36,613 --> 00:09:38,913
You've gone up against
this man how many times?

239
00:09:38,965 --> 00:09:40,598
Enough to know that
he's a piece of shit

240
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:42,466
that'll cross whatever line
it takes to win.

241
00:09:42,502 --> 00:09:44,952
All I've heard so far
is the line that you crossed.

242
00:09:45,581 --> 00:09:49,149
Listen, you may understand
some things about people,

243
00:09:49,185 --> 00:09:50,751
but you don't understand
what I do.

244
00:09:50,786 --> 00:09:52,820
Well, it sounds to me like
what you did was attack a man

245
00:09:52,822 --> 00:09:54,038
that was waving a white flag.

246
00:09:54,073 --> 00:09:55,422
Were you listening?

247
00:09:55,424 --> 00:09:58,125
He wasn't waving a white flag,
he was setting us up.

248
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,960
How can you be so sure?

249
00:09:59,996 --> 00:10:01,262
Because I know Tanner.

250
00:10:01,297 --> 00:10:03,597
Okay, well, if you know so well
what he was capable of,

251
00:10:03,649 --> 00:10:06,200
why was it such a good idea
to pick a fight with him?

252
00:10:06,202 --> 00:10:08,569
Because it's what I do.

253
00:10:08,604 --> 00:10:11,405
Well, maybe it's time to
consider changing what you do.

254
00:10:14,247 --> 00:10:15,413
(Rachel)
Okay, here we go.

255
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:17,415
What about Gentech
and Orion Pharmaceuticals?

256
00:10:17,417 --> 00:10:20,718
Monster merger, contingent fee,
and huge upside.

257
00:10:20,754 --> 00:10:22,634
And Cravath is listed
as the attorney of record,

258
00:10:22,656 --> 00:10:25,690
which means if they swap out,
it blows the whole thing up.

259
00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:26,658
Okay, well, that's the last one.

260
00:10:26,693 --> 00:10:29,627
Shit.

261
00:10:30,104 --> 00:10:31,553
Wait, this has been here
the whole time.

262
00:10:31,605 --> 00:10:32,605
What about John Dellmore?

263
00:10:32,606 --> 00:10:34,005
They're merging
with Arkin Financial.

264
00:10:34,041 --> 00:10:35,574
Haven't been announced yet,
it's just sitting there

265
00:10:35,609 --> 00:10:36,975
- ripe for the taking.
- No, not gonna happen.

266
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:38,377
Dellmore's been with
Harmon and Shupe for decades.

267
00:10:38,412 --> 00:10:40,011
So what? Harmon and Shupe
is a third-tier law firm

268
00:10:40,064 --> 00:10:41,179
and Shupe is a joke.

269
00:10:41,215 --> 00:10:42,948
She's also John Dellmore's wife.

270
00:10:42,983 --> 00:10:44,332
Well, so then maybe
we can convince Dellmore

271
00:10:44,385 --> 00:10:45,684
that his wife is a trollop.

272
00:10:45,719 --> 00:10:47,352
- Louis!
- God damn it!

273
00:10:47,404 --> 00:10:48,987
What is going on?

274
00:10:49,022 --> 00:10:51,823
I need Jack Soloff to overturn
the compensation vote,

275
00:10:51,825 --> 00:10:53,675
and the only way for me
to do that is to bring in

276
00:10:53,727 --> 00:10:55,260
a big contingent client.

277
00:10:55,312 --> 00:10:56,495
And share the money with him.

278
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:59,081
Exactly!
And none of these people are it.

279
00:10:59,133 --> 00:11:00,399
Okay.

280
00:11:00,434 --> 00:11:02,401
Wait, where are you going?

281
00:11:02,436 --> 00:11:03,602
Like you said,
none of these people are it.

282
00:11:03,654 --> 00:11:05,103
It's late, we're both exhausted,

283
00:11:05,105 --> 00:11:06,371
and I've got a test
in the morning.

284
00:11:06,407 --> 00:11:07,539
Rachel, please.

285
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:09,040
Louis, I'm sorry.

286
00:11:09,042 --> 00:11:10,375
We'll work on it
tomorrow morning, I promise.

287
00:11:10,411 --> 00:11:12,110
Rach...

288
00:11:15,115 --> 00:11:16,648
[sighs]

289
00:11:16,683 --> 00:11:19,484
Gentlemen, I don't like granting
TROs without a good reason.

290
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:20,718
We have a good reason,
Your Honor.

291
00:11:20,754 --> 00:11:22,053
It's called a contract.

292
00:11:22,088 --> 00:11:24,088
A contract that explicitly
states that any product

293
00:11:24,124 --> 00:11:26,157
Alyssa Lang developed
during her employment

294
00:11:26,192 --> 00:11:27,725
is the property of our client.

295
00:11:27,761 --> 00:11:29,961
Unfortunately that contract
is unenforceable.

296
00:11:30,235 --> 00:11:33,069
It is unless I woke up
in Russia this morning.

297
00:11:33,105 --> 00:11:34,654
Your Honor, I have here a copy

298
00:11:34,706 --> 00:11:36,006
of Alyssa Lang's
birth certificate.

299
00:11:36,041 --> 00:11:37,474
She may have signed
that contract,

300
00:11:37,509 --> 00:11:40,177
but it isn't binding because
she was only 16 at the time.

301
00:11:40,212 --> 00:11:41,695
What?

302
00:11:41,747 --> 00:11:43,530
Your Honor, I know this man,

303
00:11:43,582 --> 00:11:45,148
and that document
could have come from anywhere.

304
00:11:45,184 --> 00:11:46,744
Get it verified
by the labs at Quantico.

305
00:11:46,752 --> 00:11:48,318
All it's gonna prove
is that Alyssa Lang

306
00:11:48,353 --> 00:11:50,529
had no legal capacity to sign.

307
00:11:50,551 --> 00:11:52,384
It doesn't matter how old
she was when she signed it.

308
00:11:52,419 --> 00:11:53,752
It was ten years ago.

309
00:11:53,787 --> 00:11:55,771
She's cashed every paycheck
she got since.

310
00:11:55,823 --> 00:11:57,022
And you can argue that at trial,

311
00:11:57,024 --> 00:11:59,157
but we have laws
protecting minors for a reason,

312
00:11:59,193 --> 00:12:00,492
and I'm not granting a TRO.

313
00:12:00,527 --> 00:12:01,643
And one more thing, Your Honor.

314
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:03,479
We have payment in full,
discharging her debt,

315
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,080
and are requesting her doors
be reopened.

316
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:07,115
That has nothing to do
with why we're here.

317
00:12:07,167 --> 00:12:09,501
Save it for trial, Mr. Specter.
It's lunch.

318
00:12:09,536 --> 00:12:11,737
I'm hungry, and those padlocks
are coming off today.

319
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:13,939
[bangs gavel]

320
00:12:13,974 --> 00:12:15,457
What the hell was that?

321
00:12:15,492 --> 00:12:17,926
That was the sound
of your face hitting the canvas.

322
00:12:17,961 --> 00:12:19,211
I suggest you stay down.

323
00:12:19,246 --> 00:12:21,847
I'm not staying anywhere,
you son of a bitch.

324
00:12:22,485 --> 00:12:23,901
- Excuse me?
- You heard me.

325
00:12:23,953 --> 00:12:27,121
Your client was 16 years old and
you conveniently left that out

326
00:12:27,156 --> 00:12:28,589
of your changed man speech.

327
00:12:28,641 --> 00:12:30,424
I didn't tell you about her
because I knew you wouldn't

328
00:12:30,459 --> 00:12:33,193
listen to a thing I said after
I offered you a fair deal

329
00:12:33,245 --> 00:12:34,395
and you told me to go to hell.

330
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:35,879
Bullshit.
You didn't tell us because

331
00:12:35,915 --> 00:12:37,444
you wanted to blindside us
in court.

332
00:12:37,544 --> 00:12:38,910
Hey, you're the one who
turned out the lights out

333
00:12:38,945 --> 00:12:41,212
on Alyssa's business while
I was extending an olive branch.

334
00:12:41,214 --> 00:12:42,296
Bullshit again.

335
00:12:42,348 --> 00:12:43,714
We both know
that settlement offer

336
00:12:43,716 --> 00:12:47,051
was nothing but a distraction.

337
00:12:47,103 --> 00:12:49,637
You want a distraction?

338
00:12:49,689 --> 00:12:52,807
That is a draft of Alyssa Lang's
sexual harassment complaint

339
00:12:52,859 --> 00:12:54,358
against your client.

340
00:12:54,394 --> 00:12:56,894
As far as our offer goes,
it wasn't a distraction

341
00:12:56,946 --> 00:12:58,229
because we haven't
filed that yet

342
00:12:58,281 --> 00:13:00,064
and our offer's
still on the table.

343
00:13:00,116 --> 00:13:01,649
I advise you to take it.

344
00:13:11,618 --> 00:13:13,519
You didn't believe the sexual
harassment allegation?

345
00:13:13,554 --> 00:13:14,920
- Not a chance.
- Why not?

346
00:13:14,955 --> 00:13:17,406
Well, for starters,
it came out of Tanner's mouth.

347
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:20,359
And I know Tim Petroff,
and he didn't cheat on his wife.

348
00:13:20,999 --> 00:13:21,931
And you're angry at him
for that?

349
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:23,199
You're damn right I am!

350
00:13:23,235 --> 00:13:26,102
There are some things
you just don't do.

351
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:27,437
Like lie?

352
00:13:27,472 --> 00:13:30,073
Like threaten to rip
a man's family apart.

353
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:31,908
Hmm.

354
00:13:31,943 --> 00:13:33,543
What?

355
00:13:33,578 --> 00:13:36,312
I just find it interesting
that you talk about family

356
00:13:36,348 --> 00:13:38,815
as if it were sacred,
yet you've never married.

357
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:40,517
You've never had
a family of your own.

I don't see any
macaroni paintings

359

in here either.

360
00:13:43,689 --> 00:13:45,221
And my personal life
is not the topic here.

361
00:13:45,257 --> 00:13:46,856
So why don't we get back
to what is?

362
00:13:46,892 --> 00:13:49,359
If it was such a good idea
to pick a fight with Tanner,

363
00:13:49,394 --> 00:13:51,244
why were you so angry at him
for doing exactly

364
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:52,379
what you knew he would do?

365
00:13:52,414 --> 00:13:55,714
You're the doctor.
You tell me.

366
00:13:55,814 --> 00:13:59,783
Okay, maybe because
getting angry at someone

367
00:13:59,818 --> 00:14:02,586
is a way to avoid facing
what's going on with yourself.

Tim Petroff of BetaSoft
in my office.

He's been wearing out
your carpet for half an hour.

374
00:14:20,672 --> 00:14:22,572
Tanner must have sent him a copy
of the complaint.

375
00:14:22,608 --> 00:14:25,275
If you mean that paper balled up
in his fist, I'd say he did.

Thanks for the heads-up,
Gretchen.

Tim, before you say anything...

What the hell is this?

It's only a draft.
It hasn't been filed yet.

And that's supposed
to make me feel better?

381
00:14:38,069 --> 00:14:39,135
It's a goddamn lie.

382
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:40,603
I have never done anything

383

remotely resembling
harassing anyone.

00:14:42,373 --> 00:14:44,773
- Tim, calm down.
- I'm not going to calm down.

385
00:14:44,809 --> 00:14:47,604
This is a complete twisting
of who I am.

386

I want this woman destroyed.

387
00:14:49,473 --> 00:14:51,022
It's not her.
It's her lawyer.

I don't care who it is.

389

I have a wife and children,
and I want this thing gone.

390
00:14:54,911 --> 00:14:56,578
Then you should know there's
a settlement on the table.

391
00:14:56,613 --> 00:14:57,712
Mike!
Not now.

392
00:14:57,748 --> 00:14:58,813
What settlement?

393
00:14:58,849 --> 00:15:00,915
A 15% stake in her venture.

394
00:15:00,951 --> 00:15:02,634
Are you out of your mind?

395
00:15:02,686 --> 00:15:03,818
You think I'm gonna settle
with these people

396
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:04,819
based on blackmail?

397
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:06,087
No one's settling.

Yeah, you're damn right
no one's settling.

I'll give him a piece,

he'll know it's worth
a fortune to him

427
00:16:07,648 --> 00:16:08,831

430
00:16:11,364 --> 00:16:13,498
He won't.
I'll make up some sob story

about how Dellmore
made up with his wife

432
00:16:14,851 --> 00:16:15,917

to fight another day.

Well, I made a promise
to Harvey.

between Jack hating me

00:19:19,179 --> 00:19:20,211
There's nothing
in that complaint

515
00:19:20,246 --> 00:19:21,879
that isn't factually correct.

516
00:19:21,915 --> 00:19:23,664
You are twisting those facts
and you could ruin a man's life,

517

and you know it.

518
00:19:25,218 --> 00:19:27,385
Oh, and how is that different
from what he's doing to me?

519
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:29,337
- It's completely different.
- Is it?

520
00:19:29,389 --> 00:19:32,006
I worked for that man
60 hours a week for 10 years,

521
00:19:32,058 --> 00:19:33,591
and now that I want
to start my own company,

522
00:19:33,593 --> 00:19:35,143
he not only wants to crush me,

523
00:19:35,178 --> 00:19:37,061
but he told people
I stole the idea.

524
00:19:37,097 --> 00:19:39,764
If that's not ruining a person's
life, then I don't know what is.

525
00:19:39,816 --> 00:19:42,100
Oh, and as far
as Travis Tanner goes,

526
00:19:42,102 --> 00:19:44,102
sexual harassment
wasn't his idea.

527
00:19:44,104 --> 00:19:45,319
It was mine.

528
00:19:45,355 --> 00:19:47,071
And when he tried
to talk me out of it,

529
00:19:47,107 --> 00:19:48,656
I told him he could either
get on board

530
00:19:48,691 --> 00:19:51,242
or watch me get another lawyer.

a brilliant attorney,

God damn it!
What did Donna tell you?

540
00:20:25,511 --> 00:20:26,843
She told me
that if it went well,

541
00:20:26,879 --> 00:20:28,545
you would come in here trying
to get a celebratory mud,

542
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:29,846
and that if it didn't go well,

543
00:20:29,882 --> 00:20:31,548
you would try to get
a sympathy mud.

544
00:20:31,583 --> 00:20:33,283
Wait a second, I could have
got a sympathy mud?

545
00:20:33,318 --> 00:20:34,651
No, you couldn't.

546
00:20:34,686 --> 00:20:36,903
But the good news is, you got
what you wanted with Jack,

547
00:20:36,955 --> 00:20:39,990
and on top of that, Louis,
you really made a difference

548
00:20:39,991 --> 00:20:41,774
in the lives
of homeless children.

549
00:20:41,809 --> 00:20:42,959
Which reminds me.
After the vote,

00:20:43,011 --> 00:20:44,210
I want you to put a stop payment
on that check.

551
00:20:44,245 --> 00:20:46,879
Okay, no... that is
a despicable thing to do.

Please, any charity
claiming to do a good thing

553
00:20:48,616 --> 00:20:50,233
is clearly a scam.
I won't have it.

So you mean you're cheap?

You know what, for someone who
won't throw me a sympathy mud,

556
00:20:53,221 --> 00:20:55,304
you're very judgmental.

Louis.
What can I do for you?

00:21:00,967 --> 00:21:01,983
You can give me your proxy.

559
00:21:02,018 --> 00:21:03,384
Why would I do that?

560
00:21:03,386 --> 00:21:06,437
Because you asked me to bring
the compensation issue up

561
00:21:06,489 --> 00:21:08,773
for a vote like a man and I did.

562
00:21:08,825 --> 00:21:10,105
And is Jack Soloff
aware of this?

Not only aware of it,
he's voting for it.

And however did you get him
to do that?

565

you should know.

her eyes, told you a sob story,

some kind of innocent.

No, I don't.

574
00:21:46,528 --> 00:21:49,929
In fact, she told me that the
sexual harassment idea was hers.

convince her to do that bullshit

00:25:40,033 --> 00:25:41,933
and it started with you
ripping off cancer victims,

686
00:25:41,969 --> 00:25:44,102
not to mention every other thing
you've ever done.

687
00:25:44,137 --> 00:25:46,187
Hey, I told you
I am not that guy anymore.

688
00:25:46,223 --> 00:25:48,690
Yeah, right before you tried
to ruin my client's life

689
00:25:48,742 --> 00:25:50,775
with some bullshit
sexual harassment charge.

690
00:25:50,811 --> 00:25:52,794
Right after he padlocked
my client's livelihood.

691
00:25:52,846 --> 00:25:54,346
Yeah, you're damn right he did!

692
00:25:54,381 --> 00:25:55,647
- Harvey...
- Because if you're on a case

693
00:25:55,682 --> 00:25:57,399
against me,
it's just a matter of time

694
00:25:57,434 --> 00:25:59,017
until you eviscerate
someone I care about.

695
00:25:59,069 --> 00:26:00,318
Eviscerate?

696
00:26:00,354 --> 00:26:02,020
If I was gonna eviscerate
someone you cared about,

697
00:26:02,022 --> 00:26:03,104
all I'd have to do is point out

698
00:26:03,156 --> 00:26:04,636
how Donna's no longer
working for you.

699
00:26:04,658 --> 00:26:06,074
- Hey, get out of here, Tanner.
- She's working for Louis Litt.

700
00:26:06,109 --> 00:26:07,742
- What did you just say to me?
- You heard me.

701
00:26:07,778 --> 00:26:09,394
And then I'd go up to her
and say, "What happened, Red?

702
00:26:09,429 --> 00:26:10,829
"Did Harvey get tired
of banging you?

that you left him

just like Harvey's mom

telling the truth?

711

What does it matter?

712
00:26:37,232 --> 00:26:39,065
Well, you could be ruining
this woman's life.

didn't trust swore he changed.

a chance to prove that,

second chances.

732
00:27:15,474 --> 00:27:17,424
I thought we were talking
about the case.

733
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:19,493
We started by talking
about your dream.

734
00:27:19,528 --> 00:27:21,161
Yeah, the one I had
because of my case.

735
00:27:21,197 --> 00:27:24,531
Mm-hmm. And you said the woman
in that dream wasn't Donna.

736
00:27:25,091 --> 00:27:27,191
But it doesn't add up,
because the man was Tanner

737
00:27:27,226 --> 00:27:29,193
and you just told me what he
said about her the same day

738
00:27:29,227 --> 00:27:30,426
that you had that dream.

739
00:27:30,462 --> 00:27:31,427
Yeah, well, I don't care
if it doesn't add up

740
00:27:31,463 --> 00:27:32,663
because I'm telling the truth.

741
00:27:32,697 --> 00:27:36,232
And yet you have tells
all over you that say otherwise.

742
00:27:36,268 --> 00:27:39,719
Then you don't know what a tell
is, because I don't have any.

743
00:27:39,771 --> 00:27:41,804
All right.

744
00:27:41,856 --> 00:27:44,490
We'll see who knows
what a tell is.

745
00:27:44,526 --> 00:27:46,009
You want to play poker with me?

746
00:27:46,044 --> 00:27:48,278
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.

747
00:27:48,313 --> 00:27:50,346
I'm gonna play poker with you.

748
00:27:50,398 --> 00:27:53,182
And when I win,
and you're out of money,

749
00:27:53,184 --> 00:27:55,385
you're gonna tell me the truth.

750
00:27:56,258 --> 00:27:57,791
And what do I get
when you're out of money?

751
00:27:57,826 --> 00:28:00,627
It doesn't matter 'cause
it's never gonna happen.

I need to talk to you
about something.

What's going on?

755
00:28:12,474 --> 00:28:13,914
I just got a call
from Travis Tanner.

756
00:28:14,158 --> 00:28:15,458
He wants me to meet him
in half an hour.

757
00:28:15,493 --> 00:28:16,625
Well, you have to tell Harvey.

758
00:28:16,661 --> 00:28:17,960
I left him two messages.

759

He hasn't gotten back to me,
but even if he does,

760

he's gonna tell me not to go.

761
00:28:20,631 --> 00:28:22,131
Well, then don't go.

762
00:28:22,293 --> 00:28:23,993
You can't go behind
Harvey's back.

763
00:28:24,117 --> 00:28:25,583
That's the thing.

764
00:28:25,619 --> 00:28:28,059
What if going to see Tanner is
more like having Harvey's back?

765
00:28:28,088 --> 00:28:29,187
What are you talking about?

766
00:28:29,222 --> 00:28:30,782
The client on the other side
of our case

767
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:32,724
made a fake ID ten years ago

768
00:28:32,759 --> 00:28:34,926
and now Harvey's ready
to send her to prison for it,

769
00:28:34,961 --> 00:28:36,561
and he's only doing it
because of Tanner.

770
00:28:36,596 --> 00:28:37,896
Okay, but it's still
Harvey's call.

771
00:28:37,931 --> 00:28:40,164
And if he makes that call
in his current state of mind,

772
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,866
he might regret it
for the rest of his life.

773
00:28:41,902 --> 00:28:44,335
What do you mean,
his current state of mind?

774
00:28:48,074 --> 00:28:50,341
A couple of weeks ago,
I walked into Harvey's office

775
00:28:50,377 --> 00:28:53,244
and he was having
a panic attack.

776
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,846
Oh, my God.

777
00:28:55,067 --> 00:28:56,417
And on top of that, yesterday,

778
00:28:56,469 --> 00:28:57,801
the two of them
got into a yelling match

779
00:28:57,803 --> 00:29:02,072
that ended
with Harvey punching Tanner.

780
00:29:02,108 --> 00:29:04,324
Okay, look.

- Bullshit, you don't know.

seen him since last night.

to fool Jack and it backfired?

A client needed someone
to get his son out of rehab

so that he could attend
his mother's funeral.

828
00:31:14,083 --> 00:31:16,049
I knew it was a mistake
to even get involved

829
00:31:16,085 --> 00:31:20,187
because he wanted it so badly,
but he was a long-time client

830
00:31:20,222 --> 00:31:22,456

but I gave the go-ahead anyway,

834

and the night of the funeral,

835
00:31:35,399 --> 00:31:38,701

What can I say?

1029
00:40:45,999 --> 00:40:48,800
You telling me that story
got to me.

1030
00:40:48,836 --> 00:40:52,537
So you're ready
to tell the truth?

1031
00:40:52,573 --> 00:40:54,740
I am.

1032
00:40:54,775 --> 00:40:59,544
The woman in my dream was Donna.

1033
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:02,547
Well, I'm glad you came back
to talk about it.

1034
00:41:02,583 --> 00:41:03,882
And since you've opened up
to me,

1035
00:41:03,917 --> 00:41:06,468
I'm going to open up to you.

1036
00:41:06,503 --> 00:41:07,919
I believe you're telling
the truth.

1037
00:41:07,955 --> 00:41:10,655
- That's opening up?
- No, this is.

1038
00:41:10,691 --> 00:41:12,524
I believe you're telling
the truth,

1039
00:41:12,526 --> 00:41:13,658
but I don't think the woman

1040
00:41:13,694 --> 00:41:17,345
in your dream
was actually Donna.

1041
00:41:17,381 --> 00:41:19,931
I think it was your mother.

1042
00:41:19,967 --> 00:41:24,136
I don't believe it.

1043
00:41:24,171 --> 00:41:28,073
I tell you the thing that's
been eating at me for days,

1044
00:41:28,108 --> 00:41:29,474
and you're calling me a liar?

1045
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:30,942
No, I'm not calling you a liar.

1046
00:41:31,074 --> 00:41:33,774
Your dream was a representation
of unresolved issues.

1047
00:41:33,805 --> 00:41:35,972
The only unresolved issue
is I opened up

1048
00:41:36,024 --> 00:41:37,390
and you're turning on me.

1049
00:41:37,442 --> 00:41:39,108
Harvey, bringing up your mother
isn't turning on you.

1050
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:41,611
You have no idea what
bringing up my mother is to me!

1051
00:41:41,646 --> 00:41:43,829
No, I don't. That's the whole
point of what we're doing here.

1052
00:41:43,881 --> 00:41:45,998
It doesn't matter what we're
doing here 'cause we're done.

1053
00:41:46,050 --> 00:41:47,717
Harvey, Harvey, look.

1054
00:41:47,752 --> 00:41:48,951
I don't care how much money
you make

1055
00:41:48,987 --> 00:41:50,970
or how many women
you sleep with.

1056
00:41:51,005 --> 00:41:53,923
You have issues in your life
that will keep you

1057
00:41:53,925 --> 00:41:55,474
from having real relationships.

1058
00:41:55,510 --> 00:41:57,727
And you can tell yourself
all you want

1059
00:41:57,762 --> 00:41:59,629
that it has nothing to do
with your mother,

1060
00:41:59,664 --> 00:42:01,297
but it's a lie and you know it.

1061
00:42:01,332 --> 00:42:05,017
Hmm.
Well, like I said, we're done.
