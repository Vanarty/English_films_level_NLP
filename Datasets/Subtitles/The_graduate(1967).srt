1
00:00:27,604 --> 00:00:31,940
Ladies and gentlemen, we are about
to begin our descent into Los Angeles.

2
00:00:31,983 --> 00:00:35,694
The sound you just heard is
the landing gear locking into place.

3
00:00:35,778 --> 00:00:39,656
Los Angeles weather is clear.
Temperature is 72.

4
00:00:39,741 --> 00:00:44,286
We expect to make our 4-hour
and 18-minute flight on schedule.

5
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:46,246
We have enjoyed having you onboard,

6
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:49,166
and look forward to seeing
you again in the near future.

7
00:00:56,674 --> 00:01:00,344
Please hold handrail
and stand to the right.

8
00:01:00,637 --> 00:01:04,139
If you wish to pass,
please do so on the left.

9
00:02:54,166 --> 00:02:59,628
Attention, please. Parking in
this area is limited to three minutes only.

10
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:03,090
Please do not leave your car unattended.

11
00:03:20,317 --> 00:03:22,651
Hey, what's the matter?

12
00:03:24,321 --> 00:03:27,782
The guests are all downstairs, Ben,
waiting to see you.

13
00:03:30,285 --> 00:03:34,622
Look, Dad, could you explain to them
that I have to be alone for a while?

14
00:03:34,956 --> 00:03:37,166
These are all our good friends, Ben.

15
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,710
Most of them have known you since...

16
00:03:39,795 --> 00:03:43,798
Well, practically since you were born.
What is it, Ben?

17
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:46,801
I'm just...

18
00:03:47,427 --> 00:03:48,969
Worried?

19
00:03:52,349 --> 00:03:53,766
Well...

20
00:03:54,393 --> 00:03:55,935
About what?

21
00:03:56,478 --> 00:03:58,813
I guess about my future.

22
00:04:01,233 --> 00:04:02,650
What about it?

23
00:04:03,402 --> 00:04:04,735
I don't know.

24
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:08,572
I want it to be...

25
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:11,617
To be what?

26
00:04:14,413 --> 00:04:15,663
Different.

27
00:04:17,457 --> 00:04:18,499
Is anything wrong?

28
00:04:18,542 --> 00:04:20,709
No, no.
We're just on our way downstairs.

29
00:04:20,794 --> 00:04:22,545
The Carlsons are here.

30
00:04:22,963 --> 00:04:25,047
They are? Well, come on.

31
00:04:25,132 --> 00:04:27,341
They came all the way from Tarzana.

32
00:04:28,176 --> 00:04:30,010
Come on, let's get cracking.

33
00:04:30,053 --> 00:04:33,347
It's a wonderful thing
to have so many devoted friends.

34
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:36,892
Hey, there's
the award-winning scholar.

35
00:04:36,977 --> 00:04:39,562
- We're all very proud of you, Ben.
- Thank you, Mrs. Carlson.

36
00:04:39,646 --> 00:04:41,522
Is that the new car out there?
That little red wop job?

37
00:04:41,606 --> 00:04:42,773
That's Ben's graduation present.

38
00:04:42,858 --> 00:04:44,817
Well, you won't have much trouble
picking up in that, will you?

39
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:47,862
- Sir?
- The girls, the chicks, the teenyboppers.

40
00:04:47,904 --> 00:04:50,823
Oh, I think Ben's gotten beyond
the teenybopper stage, haven't you, Ben?

41
00:04:50,866 --> 00:04:52,825
Yes, ma'am.

42
00:04:53,034 --> 00:04:56,537
Excuse me. I think I'd just like to check
something on the car for a minute.

43
00:04:56,621 --> 00:04:59,415
His father bought him
an Alfa Romeo. You know what that is?

44
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:03,210
Hey, here's the track star.
How are you, track star?

45
00:05:03,295 --> 00:05:04,462
Just fine, Mr. Loomis.

46
00:05:04,546 --> 00:05:07,590
I wanna get a drink, then I wanna
hear all about that thing you won,

47
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:08,883
that Hopperman Award.

48
00:05:08,967 --> 00:05:10,718
- Halpingham.
- Halpingham. Right.

49
00:05:10,802 --> 00:05:12,219
You wait right here.

50
00:05:16,391 --> 00:05:18,017
Ben.

51
00:05:19,144 --> 00:05:20,686
We're all so proud of you.

52
00:05:20,729 --> 00:05:24,607
Oh, proud, proud, proud,
proud, proud, proud.

53
00:05:25,108 --> 00:05:26,609
What are you going to do now?

54
00:05:26,693 --> 00:05:28,736
I was going to go upstairs for a minute.

55
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:31,322
- I meant with your future.
Your life.

56
00:05:31,406 --> 00:05:33,073
Well, that's a little hard to say.

57
00:05:33,116 --> 00:05:35,493
- Ben.
- Excuse me.

58
00:05:35,785 --> 00:05:37,077
Mr. McGuire.

59
00:05:38,246 --> 00:05:39,914
Ben.

60
00:05:39,998 --> 00:05:41,332
Mr. McGuire.

61
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:45,085
Come with me for a minute.
I wanna talk to you.

62
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:47,713
- Excuse us, Joanne.
- Of course.

63
00:05:47,756 --> 00:05:49,215
MR. McGUIRE: Thank you.

64
00:05:50,008 --> 00:05:52,176
- He is such a lamb.
- Congratulations, Ben.

65
00:05:52,427 --> 00:05:54,053
I look at him,
and I can't believe it.

66
00:05:54,095 --> 00:05:55,763
I simply can't believe it.

67
00:05:57,265 --> 00:05:59,266
I just wanna say one word to you.

68
00:06:00,018 --> 00:06:02,019
Just one word.

69
00:06:03,396 --> 00:06:04,605
Yes, sir.

70
00:06:04,689 --> 00:06:06,941
- Are you listening?
- Yes, I am.

71
00:06:07,025 --> 00:06:08,359
Plastics.

72
00:06:11,613 --> 00:06:13,322
Exactly how do you mean?

73
00:06:13,406 --> 00:06:15,824
There's a great future in plastics.

74
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:17,284
Think about it.

75
00:06:17,327 --> 00:06:19,745
- Will you think about it?
- Yes, I will.

76
00:06:19,788 --> 00:06:22,248
Enough said. That's a deal.

77
00:06:22,582 --> 00:06:25,334
Here he is now. Here's Ben.

78
00:06:25,752 --> 00:06:27,628
Excuse me just a minute.

79
00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:32,007
Listen, everybody.
I want you all to be quiet.

80
00:06:32,092 --> 00:06:34,051
I've got Ben's college yearbook here,

81
00:06:34,135 --> 00:06:37,721
and I just want to read you
some of the wonderful things about Ben.

82
00:06:37,806 --> 00:06:40,182
Be quiet, please!

83
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,977
"Captain of the cross-country team,
head of the debating club,

84
00:06:44,061 --> 00:06:47,564
"associate editor of the college newspaper
in his junior year,

85
00:06:47,648 --> 00:06:49,732
"managing editor in his senior... "

86
00:07:26,061 --> 00:07:29,230
Oh, I guess this isn't the bathroom, is it?

87
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,524
It's down the hall.

88
00:07:31,984 --> 00:07:33,443
How are you, Benjamin?

89
00:07:33,527 --> 00:07:35,194
Fine, thank you, Mrs. Robinson.

90
00:07:35,237 --> 00:07:38,823
The bathroom's
down at the end of the hall.

91
00:07:39,491 --> 00:07:41,034
Such a pleasant room.

92
00:07:41,744 --> 00:07:44,370
Look. Mrs. Robinson,

93
00:07:44,413 --> 00:07:46,998
I don't mean to be rude, but I'm awfully...

94
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:48,750
Is there an ashtray in here?

95
00:07:50,377 --> 00:07:51,919
No.

96
00:07:52,004 --> 00:07:54,714
Oh, yes, I forgot...
The track star doesn't smoke.

97
00:08:03,223 --> 00:08:04,599
Is it a girl?

98
00:08:05,893 --> 00:08:07,226
Is what a girl?

99
00:08:08,437 --> 00:08:10,563
Whatever it is that's upsetting you.

100
00:08:10,606 --> 00:08:14,442
Oh, no, I'm just sort of disturbed
about things.

101
00:08:14,943 --> 00:08:17,278
- In general?
- That's right.

102
00:08:19,907 --> 00:08:24,619
- Well, congratulations.
- Thank you.

103
00:08:27,831 --> 00:08:29,290
Oh, Benjamin.

104
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:32,126
- I want to ask you something.
- What?

105
00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:34,003
- Will you take me home?
- What?

106
00:08:34,088 --> 00:08:36,464
My husband took the car.
Will you drive me home?

107
00:08:38,133 --> 00:08:40,593
Here, you take it.

108
00:08:40,928 --> 00:08:43,179
Do you know how to work a foreign shift?

109
00:08:45,015 --> 00:08:47,308
- You don't?
- No.

110
00:08:51,772 --> 00:08:52,939
Let's go.

111
00:09:18,132 --> 00:09:20,591
- Thank you.
- Right.

112
00:09:40,404 --> 00:09:42,780
- Will you come in, please?
- What?

113
00:09:43,365 --> 00:09:45,241
I'd like you to come in
till I get the lights on.

114
00:09:45,325 --> 00:09:46,367
What for?

115
00:09:46,452 --> 00:09:49,078
'Cause I don't feel safe
till I get the lights on.

116
00:10:06,889 --> 00:10:09,557
Would you mind walking
ahead of me to the sun porch?

117
00:10:09,641 --> 00:10:12,268
I feel funny
about coming into a dark house.

118
00:10:12,352 --> 00:10:14,979
- But it's light in there.
- Please.

119
00:10:40,047 --> 00:10:42,298
What do you drink? Bourbon?

120
00:10:42,382 --> 00:10:45,468
Look, Mrs. Robinson, I drove you home.

121
00:10:45,552 --> 00:10:47,678
I was glad to do it,
but I have some things on my mind.

122
00:10:47,721 --> 00:10:49,180
Can you understand that?

123
00:10:49,223 --> 00:10:51,057
- Yes.
- All right.

124
00:10:51,934 --> 00:10:53,433
What do you drink?

125
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:57,437
Benjamin, I'm sorry to be this way,

126
00:10:57,522 --> 00:10:59,731
but I don't want to be left alone
in this house.

127
00:10:59,774 --> 00:11:00,899
Why not?

128
00:11:00,983 --> 00:11:02,859
Please wait till my husband gets home.

129
00:11:03,444 --> 00:11:06,446
- When is he coming back?
- I don't know.

130
00:11:07,782 --> 00:11:09,324
- Drink?
- No.

131
00:11:12,078 --> 00:11:14,412
Are you always
this much afraid of being alone?

132
00:11:14,455 --> 00:11:15,956
Yes.

133
00:11:16,082 --> 00:11:18,917
Well, why can't you just lock
the doors and go to bed?

134
00:11:19,502 --> 00:11:21,127
I'm very neurotic.

135
00:11:35,309 --> 00:11:37,185
May I ask you a question?

136
00:11:38,604 --> 00:11:40,021
What do you think of me?

137
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:42,232
What do you mean?

138
00:11:42,275 --> 00:11:43,525
You've known me nearly all your life.

139
00:11:43,609 --> 00:11:45,277
You must have formed
some opinion of me.

140
00:11:46,946 --> 00:11:50,240
Well, I always thought
that you were a very nice person.

141
00:11:52,577 --> 00:11:54,578
Did you know I was an alcoholic?

142
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:58,957
What?

143
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,625
Did you know that?

144
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:04,337
Look, I think I should be going.

145
00:12:04,839 --> 00:12:06,047
Sit down, Benjamin.

146
00:12:06,132 --> 00:12:08,174
Mrs. Robinson,
if you don't mind my saying so,

147
00:12:08,259 --> 00:12:10,510
this conversation
is getting a little strange.

148
00:12:10,595 --> 00:12:13,013
Now, I'm sure that Mr. Robinson
will be here any minute now...

149
00:12:13,097 --> 00:12:14,180
- No.
- What?

150
00:12:14,265 --> 00:12:16,516
My husband will be back quite late.

151
00:12:16,601 --> 00:12:18,602
He should be gone for several hours.

152
00:12:20,521 --> 00:12:22,731
- Oh, my God.
- Pardon?

153
00:12:22,815 --> 00:12:24,733
Oh, no, Mrs. Robinson. Oh, no.

154
00:12:25,151 --> 00:12:26,443
What's wrong?

155
00:12:26,485 --> 00:12:29,446
Mrs. Robinson, you didn't...
I mean, you didn't expect...

156
00:12:29,488 --> 00:12:30,989
What?

157
00:12:31,073 --> 00:12:33,825
I mean, you didn't really think
I'd do something like that.

158
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:35,869
- Like what?
- What do you think?

159
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:41,124
- Well, I don't know.
- For God's sake, Mrs. Robinson.

160
00:12:41,459 --> 00:12:43,335
Here we are, you got me into your house,

161
00:12:43,419 --> 00:12:45,295
you give me a drink, you put on music.

162
00:12:45,338 --> 00:12:47,756
Now you start opening up
your personal life to me

163
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,674
and tell me your husband
won't be home for hours.

164
00:12:49,717 --> 00:12:50,800
So?

165
00:12:50,843 --> 00:12:53,637
Mrs. Robinson,
you're trying to seduce me.

166
00:12:56,557 --> 00:12:57,724
Aren't you?

167
00:12:58,517 --> 00:13:00,769
Well, no, I hadn't thought of it.

168
00:13:00,853 --> 00:13:02,062
I feel very flattered.

169
00:13:02,146 --> 00:13:04,689
Mrs. Robinson, will you forgive me
for what I just said?

170
00:13:04,982 --> 00:13:06,316
- It's all right.
- It's not all right.

171
00:13:06,359 --> 00:13:08,944
- It's the worst thing I ever said to anyone.
- Sit down.

172
00:13:09,987 --> 00:13:12,530
Please forgive me because I like you.

173
00:13:12,949 --> 00:13:14,699
I don't think of you that way,
but I'm mixed-up.

174
00:13:14,784 --> 00:13:16,284
It's all right. Finish your drink.

175
00:13:16,369 --> 00:13:18,203
Mrs. Robinson, it makes me sick
that I said that to you.

176
00:13:18,287 --> 00:13:20,705
Well, forget it right now. Finish your drink.

177
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:23,959
What is wrong with me?

178
00:13:24,043 --> 00:13:26,086
Have you ever seen Elaine's portrait?

179
00:13:30,758 --> 00:13:32,050
Her portrait?

180
00:13:32,134 --> 00:13:33,802
- Yes.
- No.

181
00:13:33,886 --> 00:13:35,804
We had it done last Christmas.
Would you like to see it?

182
00:13:35,888 --> 00:13:37,138
Very much.

183
00:13:41,477 --> 00:13:43,561
It's here in Elaine's room.

184
00:13:49,068 --> 00:13:52,237
Elaine certainly is
an attractive girl, isn't she?

185
00:13:55,032 --> 00:13:57,409
I don't remember her
as having brown eyes.

186
00:13:57,451 --> 00:13:59,452
- Benjamin.
- Yes.

187
00:13:59,537 --> 00:14:02,038
- Will you come over here a minute?
- Over there?

188
00:14:02,081 --> 00:14:03,790
Sure.

189
00:14:09,588 --> 00:14:12,966
Will you unzip my dress?
I think I'll go to bed.

190
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:14,384
Oh, well, good night.

191
00:14:14,427 --> 00:14:17,554
- Won't you unzip my dress?
- I'd rather not, Mrs. Robinson.

192
00:14:17,596 --> 00:14:19,514
If you still think I'm trying to seduce you...

193
00:14:19,598 --> 00:14:21,349
No, I don't, but I just feel a little funny.

194
00:14:21,434 --> 00:14:24,060
- Benjamin, you've known me all your life.
- I know that, but I'm just...

195
00:14:24,103 --> 00:14:26,021
Come on. It's hard for me to reach.

196
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:35,238
- Thank you.
- Right.

197
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:38,033
What are you so scared of?

198
00:14:38,117 --> 00:14:39,701
I'm not scared, Mrs. Robinson.

199
00:14:39,785 --> 00:14:41,494
Then why do you keep running away?

200
00:14:41,579 --> 00:14:44,998
Because you're going to bed.
I don't think I should be up here.

201
00:14:45,082 --> 00:14:47,417
Haven't you seen
anybody in a slip before?

202
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:49,836
Yes, I have, but I just...

203
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,005
Look, what if Mr. Robinson
walked in right now?

204
00:14:52,089 --> 00:14:53,173
What if he did?

205
00:14:53,257 --> 00:14:55,175
Well, it would look pretty funny,
wouldn't it?

206
00:14:55,259 --> 00:14:57,594
- Don't you think he trusts us together?
- Of course he does,

207
00:14:57,636 --> 00:14:59,387
but he might get the wrong idea.
Anyone might.

208
00:14:59,472 --> 00:15:02,766
I don't see why. I'm twice as old
as you are. How could anyone think...

209
00:15:02,808 --> 00:15:04,600
But they would, don't you see?

210
00:15:04,642 --> 00:15:06,560
Benjamin, I am not trying to seduce you.

211
00:15:06,644 --> 00:15:09,354
I know that, but please,
Mrs. Robinson, this is difficult...

212
00:15:09,439 --> 00:15:12,483
- Would you like me to seduce you?
- What?

213
00:15:12,567 --> 00:15:15,027
Is that what you're trying to tell me?

214
00:15:15,111 --> 00:15:17,404
I'm going home now.
I apologize for what I said.

215
00:15:17,489 --> 00:15:20,282
I hope you can forget it,
but I'm going home right now.

216
00:15:23,578 --> 00:15:25,162
- Benjamin.
- Yes?

217
00:15:25,246 --> 00:15:27,122
Will you bring up my purse before you go?

218
00:15:27,165 --> 00:15:28,499
I have to go now. I'm sorry.

219
00:15:28,541 --> 00:15:31,543
I really don't want to put this on again.
Won't you bring it up?

220
00:15:31,628 --> 00:15:34,129
- Where is it?
- On the table in the hall.

221
00:15:38,885 --> 00:15:41,512
- Mrs. Robinson?
- I'm in the bathroom.

222
00:15:41,596 --> 00:15:44,765
- Well, here's the purse.
- Could you bring it up?

223
00:15:45,183 --> 00:15:46,391
Well, I'll hand it to you.

224
00:15:46,476 --> 00:15:48,227
Come to the railing, and I'll hand it up.

225
00:15:48,311 --> 00:15:50,896
Benjamin, I'm getting
pretty tired of all the suspicion.

226
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:53,899
Now, if you won't do me a simple favor,
I don't know what.

227
00:15:55,902 --> 00:15:57,569
I'm putting it on the top step.

228
00:15:57,654 --> 00:15:59,029
For God's sake, Benjamin,

229
00:15:59,072 --> 00:16:01,615
will you stop acting this way
and bring me the purse?

230
00:16:05,453 --> 00:16:08,831
- I'm putting it here by the door.
- Will you bring it in to me?

231
00:16:08,873 --> 00:16:10,415
I'd rather not.

232
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:13,794
All right. Put it in Elaine's room
where we were.

233
00:16:13,878 --> 00:16:15,045
Right.

234
00:16:25,723 --> 00:16:27,599
Oh, God.

235
00:16:27,684 --> 00:16:28,809
Let me out.

236
00:16:28,893 --> 00:16:31,019
- Don't be nervous.
- Get away from that door.

237
00:16:31,062 --> 00:16:33,063
- I want to say something first.
- Jesus Christ.

238
00:16:33,148 --> 00:16:35,149
Benjamin, I want you to know
that I'm available to you

239
00:16:35,233 --> 00:16:36,400
and if you won't sleep with me this time...

240
00:16:36,442 --> 00:16:38,527
- Oh, my Christ.
- If you won't sleep with me this time,

241
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:40,737
I want you to know that
you can call me up any time you want,

242
00:16:40,822 --> 00:16:42,447
and we'll make
some kind of an arrangement.

243
00:16:42,532 --> 00:16:44,074
- Do you understand what I've said?
- Let me out.

244
00:16:45,243 --> 00:16:47,161
- Benjamin, do you understand what...
- Yes, yes, let me out.

245
00:16:47,245 --> 00:16:49,371
'Cause I find you very attractive.
And any time you want, you just...

246
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:51,874
Oh, Jesus, that's him.

247
00:17:03,094 --> 00:17:06,805
- Is that Ben's car in front?
- Yes, sir.

248
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:10,100
I drove... I drove Mrs. Robinson home.

249
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:13,520
She wanted me to drive her home
so I drove her home.

250
00:17:13,938 --> 00:17:15,606
Swell. I appreciate.

251
00:17:17,275 --> 00:17:18,358
She's upstairs.

252
00:17:18,443 --> 00:17:20,903
She wanted me to wait
down here till you got home.

253
00:17:21,654 --> 00:17:23,947
Standing guard
over the old castle, are you?

254
00:17:24,032 --> 00:17:25,282
Yes, sir.

255
00:17:26,701 --> 00:17:28,869
Hey, congratulations.

256
00:17:29,078 --> 00:17:30,329
Thank you.

257
00:17:30,788 --> 00:17:34,249
- Hey, looks like you need a refill.
- Oh, no, I've got to go.

258
00:17:34,584 --> 00:17:38,962
Hey, is anything wrong?
You look a little shaken up.

259
00:17:39,005 --> 00:17:42,174
Oh, no, no. I'm just a little worried
about my future.

260
00:17:42,508 --> 00:17:44,927
I'm a little upset about my future.

261
00:17:45,678 --> 00:17:48,430
All right, come on,
let's have a nightcap together.

262
00:17:48,473 --> 00:17:51,433
- Scotch?
- Bourbon.

263
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:55,145
Ben...

264
00:17:57,106 --> 00:17:59,316
How old are you now?

265
00:18:00,068 --> 00:18:02,611
Twenty. I'll be 21 next week.

266
00:18:14,249 --> 00:18:17,501
- That's a hell of a good age to be.
- Thank you.

267
00:18:21,005 --> 00:18:22,506
Thank you very much, sir.

268
00:18:29,597 --> 00:18:34,101
I... I wish I was that age again.

269
00:18:35,019 --> 00:18:37,104
- Because, Ben...
- Sir?

270
00:18:38,439 --> 00:18:42,067
- You'll never be young again.
- I know.

271
00:18:49,701 --> 00:18:52,911
Ben, can I say something to you?

272
00:18:52,996 --> 00:18:54,121
What?

273
00:18:56,416 --> 00:19:00,794
How long
have we known each other now?

274
00:19:02,213 --> 00:19:06,008
How long
have you and I known each other?

275
00:19:06,801 --> 00:19:10,637
How long
have your dad and I been partners?

276
00:19:10,722 --> 00:19:12,222
Quite a while.

277
00:19:19,521 --> 00:19:22,064
- I watched you grow up, Ben.
- Yes, sir.

278
00:19:24,568 --> 00:19:28,779
In many ways,
I feel as though you were my own son.

279
00:19:28,864 --> 00:19:30,197
Thank you.

280
00:19:34,745 --> 00:19:36,704
So I hope you won't mind

281
00:19:36,747 --> 00:19:40,041
my giving you a friendly piece of advice.

282
00:19:41,418 --> 00:19:42,835
I'd like to hear it.

283
00:19:47,257 --> 00:19:48,424
Ben,

284
00:19:49,343 --> 00:19:50,593
I think...

285
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,596
I think you ought to be taking it

286
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:56,891
a little easier right now
than you seem to be.

287
00:19:58,393 --> 00:20:02,396
Sow a few wild oats.
Take things as they come.

288
00:20:03,106 --> 00:20:05,816
Have a good time
with the girls and so forth.

289
00:20:05,942 --> 00:20:07,777
Don't get up.

290
00:20:09,488 --> 00:20:12,656
I was just telling...

291
00:20:13,408 --> 00:20:15,451
- Ben.
... Ben here

292
00:20:15,494 --> 00:20:19,538
that he ought to sow a few wild oats,
have a good time while he can.

293
00:20:19,623 --> 00:20:22,792
- You think that's sound advice?
- Yes, I do.

294
00:20:23,627 --> 00:20:25,169
I've got to go.

295
00:20:26,588 --> 00:20:30,633
You have yourself
a few flings this summer.

296
00:20:31,134 --> 00:20:33,803
I bet you're quite a ladies' man, huh?

297
00:20:33,845 --> 00:20:36,472
- Oh, no.
- What?

298
00:20:36,848 --> 00:20:41,018
You look to me like the kind of guy
who has to fight 'em off.

299
00:20:41,353 --> 00:20:45,064
Now, doesn't he look to you like the kind
of guy who has to fight them off?

300
00:20:45,148 --> 00:20:46,565
Yes, he does.

301
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:51,195
Oh, say, Elaine gets down
from Berkeley on Saturday.

302
00:20:51,279 --> 00:20:52,279
Oh, yes.

303
00:20:52,322 --> 00:20:54,824
- I want you to give her a call.
- I will.

304
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:57,201
Benjamin.

305
00:20:58,829 --> 00:21:00,246
- Benjamin?
- Yes.

306
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:01,997
Thank you for taking me home.

307
00:21:02,416 --> 00:21:04,166
I'll see you soon, I hope.

308
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:10,131
Ladies and gentlemen,
your attention, please,

309
00:21:10,173 --> 00:21:12,341
for this afternoon's feature attraction.

310
00:21:13,009 --> 00:21:14,176
Hey, over there.

311
00:21:14,803 --> 00:21:18,180
Yes, I mean you. Your attention, please.

312
00:21:19,266 --> 00:21:22,268
Are you ready in there, feature attraction?

313
00:21:22,352 --> 00:21:24,145
Could I speak to you
for a second, Dad?

314
00:21:24,187 --> 00:21:27,690
Listen. Now I'm gonna ask
for a big round of applause

315
00:21:27,732 --> 00:21:29,442
to bring this boy out here, all right?

316
00:21:29,526 --> 00:21:32,153
Now, wait a minute.
Oh, let me amend that.

317
00:21:32,195 --> 00:21:37,450
To bring this young man out here,
because today he is 21 years old.

318
00:21:39,035 --> 00:21:40,911
Yeah! Let's go! Our food is cold.

319
00:21:40,996 --> 00:21:43,622
Oh, now, just hang on a minute.
I've got a few words to say.

320
00:21:43,707 --> 00:21:46,959
You always do.
- Look who's talking.

321
00:21:48,253 --> 00:21:50,671
Dad, can we just talk
about this for a second?

322
00:21:50,714 --> 00:21:53,466
I can't hold them much longer, Ben.
You better get out here.

323
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:55,050
I'd like to discuss this.

324
00:21:55,135 --> 00:21:57,636
This boy... I'm sorry, this young man,

325
00:21:57,721 --> 00:22:01,974
is soon to continue his education
as a Frank Halpingham Award scholar.

326
00:22:03,101 --> 00:22:05,394
But before he does...

327
00:22:05,437 --> 00:22:07,271
Before he does...

328
00:22:08,356 --> 00:22:11,400
You're disappointing them, Ben.
You're disappointing them.

329
00:22:11,485 --> 00:22:14,570
- Dad, can you listen?
- Listen, I'll give you 10 seconds.

330
00:22:14,988 --> 00:22:18,407
He is going to give us
a practical demonstration

331
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:22,369
of what I feel safe in saying
is a pretty exciting birthday present.

332
00:22:23,371 --> 00:22:26,707
And it better work,
or I'm out over 200 bucks.

333
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:31,754
Okay, then, let's hear it now
for Benjamin Braddock!

334
00:22:33,924 --> 00:22:36,926
Come on, Benjy! Come on, Benjy!

335
00:22:36,968 --> 00:22:39,303
Let's hear it now! That a boy!

336
00:22:40,388 --> 00:22:43,182
Well, folks, this remarkable young man

337
00:22:43,266 --> 00:22:49,271
is going to perform for you some
spectacular and amazing feats of daring

338
00:22:49,356 --> 00:22:52,191
in water that is over 6' deep.

339
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:45,511
Hello?

340
00:24:47,723 --> 00:24:50,058
I don't quite know how to put this.

341
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:51,100
Benjamin?

342
00:24:52,061 --> 00:24:56,022
Look, I was thinking
about that time after the party.

343
00:24:56,315 --> 00:24:57,398
Where are you?

344
00:24:57,524 --> 00:25:00,401
And I was wondering if I could buy you
a drink or something.

345
00:25:00,569 --> 00:25:01,819
Where are you?

346
00:25:02,404 --> 00:25:04,906
- The Taft Hotel.
- Did you get a room?

347
00:25:06,492 --> 00:25:07,575
No.

348
00:25:08,577 --> 00:25:10,578
Now, I know it's pretty late,
and if you'd rather...

349
00:25:10,663 --> 00:25:11,913
Give me an hour.

350
00:25:11,955 --> 00:25:14,332
- What?
- I'll be there in an hour.

351
00:26:32,327 --> 00:26:34,162
- Where's the party?
- It's in the main ballroom.

352
00:26:34,246 --> 00:26:36,998
- The main ballroom.
- Just there.

353
00:26:46,633 --> 00:26:48,009
Can I help you, sir?

354
00:26:48,051 --> 00:26:51,220
What? Oh, no, I'm just...

355
00:26:51,346 --> 00:26:53,222
Are you here for an affair, sir?

356
00:26:56,185 --> 00:26:57,351
What?

357
00:26:57,394 --> 00:26:58,978
The Singleman party, sir?

358
00:26:59,021 --> 00:27:01,814
Oh, yes. The Singleman party.

359
00:27:01,857 --> 00:27:04,984
- It's in the main ballroom.
- Thank you.

360
00:27:22,878 --> 00:27:24,128
- Hello.
- Hello.

361
00:27:24,213 --> 00:27:26,589
- You must be one of the Porters.
- No, actually, I'm not...

362
00:27:26,673 --> 00:27:29,884
Yes, I'd like you to meet
my sister Miss DeWitte.

363
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:32,261
- How do you do?
- How do you do, Miss DeWitte?

364
00:27:32,346 --> 00:27:33,930
And that's my husband, Mr. Singleman.

365
00:27:34,056 --> 00:27:35,597
- Oh, sorry.
- Fine, thank you.

366
00:27:35,681 --> 00:27:37,390
- That's Jeffrey, of course.
- Of course.

367
00:27:37,475 --> 00:27:40,185
- I didn't get your name, sir.
- Benjamin Braddock, sir...

368
00:27:40,228 --> 00:27:42,354
- Braddock.
- Yes, but I'm afraid...

369
00:27:42,396 --> 00:27:44,898
Oh, no, no, no, I'll find
your table in just a moment.

370
00:27:44,941 --> 00:27:48,568
Braddock, Braddock, Braddock.
Not Braniff. We have a Braniff.

371
00:27:50,029 --> 00:27:52,197
No, actually, I'm just looking for a friend.

372
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,824
Oh, well, I don't understand.

373
00:27:53,908 --> 00:27:55,659
I'm not with your party. I'm sorry.

374
00:27:55,743 --> 00:27:57,577
Hey, I don't get it.

375
00:27:57,662 --> 00:28:00,622
I've enjoyed meeting you, Mr. Braniff.

376
00:28:50,464 --> 00:28:53,216
- Hello, Benjamin.
- Oh, hello.

377
00:28:54,468 --> 00:28:56,970
- May I sit down?
- Of course.

378
00:28:57,054 --> 00:28:58,430
Thank you.

379
00:28:59,724 --> 00:29:02,517
- How are you?
- Very well, thank you.

380
00:29:06,898 --> 00:29:09,649
- May I have a drink?
- A drink. Of course.

381
00:29:13,529 --> 00:29:14,529
He didn't see me.

382
00:29:14,614 --> 00:29:18,158
- Waiter. I will have a martini.
- Yes, ma'am.

383
00:29:21,454 --> 00:29:23,622
You don't have to be
so nervous, you know.

384
00:29:23,664 --> 00:29:26,374
Nervous? Well, I am a bit nervous.

385
00:29:26,459 --> 00:29:29,002
I mean, it's pretty hard to be suave
when you're...

386
00:29:29,921 --> 00:29:31,796
- Did you get us a room?
- What?

387
00:29:31,839 --> 00:29:34,674
- Have you gotten us a room yet?
- I haven't, no.

388
00:29:34,717 --> 00:29:36,176
Do you want to?

389
00:29:36,594 --> 00:29:40,722
Well, I don't... I mean, I could,
or we could just talk.

390
00:29:41,807 --> 00:29:45,018
- You want me to get it?
- You... Oh, no, no, I'll get it.

391
00:29:46,437 --> 00:29:47,604
Do you want to get it now?

392
00:29:47,688 --> 00:29:49,272
- Now?
- Yes.

393
00:29:50,983 --> 00:29:52,525
Well, I don't know.

394
00:29:52,902 --> 00:29:55,111
- Why don't you get it?
- Why don't I get it?

395
00:29:55,196 --> 00:29:57,697
Well, I will then, if you'll excuse me.

396
00:30:13,839 --> 00:30:15,173
Excuse me.

397
00:30:16,968 --> 00:30:18,301
Yes, sir?

398
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:21,513
A room. I'd like a room, please.

399
00:30:21,555 --> 00:30:23,223
Single room or a double room?

400
00:30:23,307 --> 00:30:25,266
A single, just for myself, please.

401
00:30:25,351 --> 00:30:27,060
Could you sign the register, please?

402
00:30:32,149 --> 00:30:34,901
- Anything wrong, sir?
- What? No, nothing.

403
00:30:43,995 --> 00:30:46,538
Do you have any luggage, Mr. Gladstone?

404
00:30:47,081 --> 00:30:49,666
Luggage? Yes, yes, I do.

405
00:30:50,084 --> 00:30:51,710
- Where is it?
- What?

406
00:30:51,752 --> 00:30:53,378
Where is your luggage?

407
00:30:54,296 --> 00:30:56,715
Well, it's in the car.
It's out there in the car.

408
00:30:56,757 --> 00:30:58,633
Very good, sir.
I'll have a porter bring it in.

409
00:30:58,718 --> 00:30:59,884
Oh, no.

410
00:31:00,928 --> 00:31:02,053
I mean, I'd...

411
00:31:02,096 --> 00:31:05,181
I'd rather not go to all
the trouble of bringing it all in.

412
00:31:05,266 --> 00:31:08,935
I just have a toothbrush.
I can get it myself, if that's all right.

413
00:31:08,978 --> 00:31:11,771
Of course. I'll have
a porter show you the room.

414
00:31:11,856 --> 00:31:15,775
Oh, well, actually,
I'd just as soon find it myself.

415
00:31:15,818 --> 00:31:18,528
I just have a toothbrush
to carry up, and I...

416
00:31:18,612 --> 00:31:20,238
I can handle it myself.

417
00:31:20,906 --> 00:31:23,616
- Whatever you say, sir.
- Thank you.

418
00:31:27,496 --> 00:31:29,122
- Mrs. Robinson?
- Yes?

419
00:31:29,206 --> 00:31:32,042
- For you.
- Thank you.

420
00:31:37,214 --> 00:31:38,214
Hello.

421
00:31:38,299 --> 00:31:39,799
Mms. Robinson?
- Yes?

422
00:31:39,842 --> 00:31:41,926
- It's Benjamin.
- Yes?

423
00:31:42,386 --> 00:31:43,970
Benjamin Braddock.

424
00:31:44,846 --> 00:31:46,430
Benjamin, where are you?

425
00:31:47,307 --> 00:31:49,308
Can you look through the glass?

426
00:31:53,646 --> 00:31:56,023
- Can you see me now?
- Yes, I can.

427
00:31:56,107 --> 00:31:58,734
- I got a single room.
- That's fine.

428
00:31:58,818 --> 00:32:03,197
But there's one thing. The desk clerk
seemed to be a little bit suspicious.

429
00:32:03,615 --> 00:32:05,407
Now, I don't know what the policy is...

430
00:32:05,492 --> 00:32:08,327
- Well, do you want to go up first?
- Yes, I think that would be good.

431
00:32:08,411 --> 00:32:11,288
- I'll be up in five minutes.
- Well, goodbye, then.

432
00:32:11,331 --> 00:32:13,290
- Benjamin.
- Yes?

433
00:32:13,333 --> 00:32:14,833
Isn't there something you want to tell me?

434
00:32:14,918 --> 00:32:16,001
- Tell you?
- Yes.

435
00:32:16,836 --> 00:32:21,590
Well, I want you to know how much
I appreciate this. Really...

436
00:32:21,674 --> 00:32:23,342
- The number.
- What?

437
00:32:23,426 --> 00:32:25,886
The room number, Benjamin.
I think you ought to tell me that.

438
00:32:25,970 --> 00:32:27,679
You're absolutely right.

439
00:32:29,182 --> 00:32:32,684
- It's 568.
- Thank you.

440
00:32:33,436 --> 00:32:34,853
You're welcome.

441
00:32:35,939 --> 00:32:37,272
Well...

442
00:32:38,066 --> 00:32:40,526
I'll see you later, Mrs. Robinson.

443
00:32:47,951 --> 00:32:49,243
Check, please.

444
00:32:51,412 --> 00:32:52,538
I've got it.

445
00:32:52,997 --> 00:32:54,289
- I say I've got it.
- Sir?

446
00:32:54,374 --> 00:32:56,667
- The toothbrush. I got it all right.
- Very good, sir.

447
00:32:56,709 --> 00:32:59,795
- Yes. Well, good night.
- Good night, sir.

448
00:34:51,991 --> 00:34:53,242
Hello, Benjamin.

449
00:34:54,327 --> 00:34:56,119
Hello, Mrs. Robinson.

450
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:32,030
Well.

451
00:35:33,574 --> 00:35:36,451
- Benjamin...
- Yes.

452
00:35:37,578 --> 00:35:39,162
I'll get undressed now. Is that all right?

453
00:35:39,205 --> 00:35:41,581
Sure. Shall I...

454
00:35:41,666 --> 00:35:43,917
I mean, shall I just stand here?

455
00:35:44,002 --> 00:35:46,169
I mean, I don't know
what you want me to do.

456
00:35:46,212 --> 00:35:48,630
- Why don't you watch?
- Oh, sure. Thank you.

457
00:35:48,715 --> 00:35:51,258
- Will you bring me a hanger?
- What?

458
00:35:51,342 --> 00:35:53,385
- A hanger.
- Oh, yes.

459
00:35:59,558 --> 00:36:01,600
- Wood?
- What?

460
00:36:02,311 --> 00:36:04,061
Wood or wire? They have both.

461
00:36:04,354 --> 00:36:06,731
- Either one will be fine.
- Okay.

462
00:36:16,575 --> 00:36:17,825
Thank you.

463
00:36:25,584 --> 00:36:28,377
- Would you help me with this, please?
- Certainly.

464
00:36:32,507 --> 00:36:34,342
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

465
00:36:53,695 --> 00:36:56,280
Benjamin, would this be
easier for you in the dark?

466
00:36:56,323 --> 00:36:57,782
Mrs. Robinson, I can't do this.

467
00:36:57,824 --> 00:37:00,451
- You what?
- This is all terribly wrong.

468
00:37:00,494 --> 00:37:02,953
- Do you find me undesirable?
- Oh, no, Mrs. Robinson.

469
00:37:03,038 --> 00:37:05,623
I think you're the most attractive
of all my parents' friends.

470
00:37:05,665 --> 00:37:07,416
I mean that. I find you desirable.

471
00:37:07,459 --> 00:37:10,336
But I... For God's sake,
can you imagine my parents?

472
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:11,462
Can you imagine what they would say

473
00:37:11,546 --> 00:37:13,672
if they just saw us here
in this room right now?

474
00:37:13,757 --> 00:37:15,716
- What would they say?
- I have no idea, Mrs. Robinson,

475
00:37:15,801 --> 00:37:17,385
but for God's sake,

476
00:37:17,469 --> 00:37:19,637
they brought me up,
they made a good life for me,

477
00:37:19,679 --> 00:37:21,263
and I think they deserve better than this.

478
00:37:21,306 --> 00:37:24,350
I think they deserve a little better than
jumping into bed with the partner's wife.

479
00:37:24,434 --> 00:37:27,311
- Are you afraid of me?
- Oh, no. You're missing the point.

480
00:37:27,396 --> 00:37:30,648
Look, maybe we could
do something else together.

481
00:37:31,316 --> 00:37:33,984
Mrs. Robinson,
would you like to go to a movie?

482
00:37:36,863 --> 00:37:39,323
- Can I ask you a personal question?
- Ask me anything you want.

483
00:37:39,408 --> 00:37:41,826
- Is this your first time?
- Is this what?

484
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:44,078
It is, isn't it? It is your first time.

485
00:37:44,162 --> 00:37:46,539
That's a laugh, Mrs. Robinson.
That's really a laugh.

486
00:37:47,499 --> 00:37:50,000
- Well, you can admit that, can't you?
- Are you kidding?

487
00:37:50,085 --> 00:37:51,419
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

488
00:37:51,503 --> 00:37:52,795
- Wait a minute.
- On your first time...

489
00:37:52,838 --> 00:37:54,839
Who said it was my first time?
Wait a minute.

490
00:37:54,881 --> 00:37:56,882
I mean, just because you happen
to be inadequate in one way...

491
00:37:56,967 --> 00:37:58,217
Inadequate?

492
00:38:02,556 --> 00:38:04,682
- Well, I guess I'd better...
- Don't move!

493
00:43:02,312 --> 00:43:04,147
Ben, what are you doing?

494
00:43:07,901 --> 00:43:12,947
Well, I would say
that I'm just drifting here in the pool.

495
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:14,365
Why?

496
00:43:15,784 --> 00:43:18,703
Well, it's very comfortable
just to drift here.

497
00:43:19,872 --> 00:43:22,749
- Have you thought about graduate school?
- No.

498
00:43:23,208 --> 00:43:26,836
Would you mind telling me, then,
what those four years of college were for?

499
00:43:26,879 --> 00:43:30,631
- What was the point of all that hard work?
- You got me.

500
00:43:30,966 --> 00:43:32,467
Now, listen, Ben.

501
00:43:34,636 --> 00:43:39,348
Look, I think it's a very good thing
that a young man,

502
00:43:39,433 --> 00:43:42,185
after he's done some very good work,

503
00:43:42,227 --> 00:43:45,062
should have a chance
to relax and enjoy himself

504
00:43:45,147 --> 00:43:48,858
and lie around and drink beer and so on.

505
00:43:49,276 --> 00:43:51,819
But after a few weeks,

506
00:43:51,862 --> 00:43:56,282
I believe that person would want to take
some stock in himself and his situation

507
00:43:56,366 --> 00:43:59,202
and start to think about getting off his ass.

508
00:43:59,870 --> 00:44:02,205
The Robinsons are here.

509
00:44:04,833 --> 00:44:07,919
Hi, Ben. What are you doing
with yourself these days?

510
00:44:08,003 --> 00:44:11,380
Oh, not too much. Taking it easy.

511
00:44:12,883 --> 00:44:15,884
That's what I'd do if I could.
Nothing wrong with that.

512
00:44:16,552 --> 00:44:19,596
Hey, Ben, Elaine's coming down
from Berkeley soon.

513
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:22,432
- I want you to call her up this time.
- I will.

514
00:44:22,892 --> 00:44:26,061
'Cause I just think you two
would hit it off real well together.

515
00:44:26,938 --> 00:44:29,439
Say hello to Mrs. Robinson, Benjamin.

516
00:44:32,485 --> 00:44:36,071
- Hello, Mrs. Robinson.
- Hello, Benjamin.

517
00:44:49,502 --> 00:44:51,586
- Oh, my.
- Hi.

518
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:55,549
- Hi. Can I talk to you for a minute?
- Sure.

519
00:44:56,342 --> 00:45:00,262
Benjy. Darling,
I'm going to ask you something,

520
00:45:00,346 --> 00:45:03,890
but you don't... You don't have
to tell me if you don't want to.

521
00:45:03,933 --> 00:45:05,141
What?

522
00:45:05,393 --> 00:45:09,729
Well, I'm going to ask you what you do
when you go off at night.

523
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:12,774
When I go off?

524
00:45:13,818 --> 00:45:15,610
You don't have to tell me
if you don't want to.

525
00:45:15,653 --> 00:45:17,737
No, I do. I want to tell you.

526
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:20,740
I drive around.

527
00:45:22,076 --> 00:45:23,952
- What else?
- Nothing else.

528
00:45:24,036 --> 00:45:25,078
Well, you don't drive around

529
00:45:25,121 --> 00:45:27,414
from midnight until noon
the next day, Benjamin.

530
00:45:27,456 --> 00:45:29,916
- Oh, no.
- Well, then what do you do?

531
00:45:31,085 --> 00:45:33,545
- You meet someone?
- Meet someone?

532
00:45:34,005 --> 00:45:35,297
Why do you say that?

533
00:45:35,339 --> 00:45:37,674
Well, this is your business.
I don't wanna play games with you.

534
00:45:37,758 --> 00:45:39,134
Wait, wait.

535
00:45:39,719 --> 00:45:42,804
I don't meet anyone, Mother,
but why do you say that?

536
00:45:43,472 --> 00:45:45,891
Benjamin, I don't want
to pry into your affairs,

537
00:45:45,975 --> 00:45:49,644
but I would rather you didn't say
anything at all than be dishonest.

538
00:45:49,729 --> 00:45:52,606
- Good night.
- Well, wait. Wait a minute.

539
00:45:53,190 --> 00:45:55,108
Will you wait a minute, please?

540
00:45:58,404 --> 00:46:04,284
Mrs. Robinson, do you think we could say
a few words to each other first this time?

541
00:46:04,827 --> 00:46:07,287
I don't think we have much
to say to each other.

542
00:46:12,043 --> 00:46:16,588
Look, for months, all we've done is
come up here and leap into bed together.

543
00:46:17,423 --> 00:46:18,882
Are you tired of it?

544
00:46:18,966 --> 00:46:21,760
I'm not, no, but do you think
we could liven it up

545
00:46:21,844 --> 00:46:23,929
with a little conversation for a change?

546
00:46:24,013 --> 00:46:25,764
Well, what do you want to talk about?

547
00:46:25,848 --> 00:46:27,933
Anything. Anything at all.

548
00:46:28,684 --> 00:46:31,686
Do you want to tell me about some
of your college experiences?

549
00:46:31,729 --> 00:46:33,146
Oh, my God.

550
00:46:37,610 --> 00:46:39,277
Think of another topic.

551
00:46:48,996 --> 00:46:50,914
How about art?

552
00:46:50,998 --> 00:46:54,501
Art. That's a good subject.
You start it off.

553
00:46:54,543 --> 00:46:57,462
You start it off.
I don't know anything about it.

554
00:46:57,546 --> 00:46:59,047
Well, what do you wanna know about it?

555
00:46:59,090 --> 00:47:02,217
Are you interested more
in modern art or in classical art?

556
00:47:02,301 --> 00:47:04,344
- Neither.
- You're not interested in art?

557
00:47:04,387 --> 00:47:06,179
- No.
- Then why do you wanna talk about it?

558
00:47:06,222 --> 00:47:08,723
- I don't.
- Now, look, we're going to do this thing.

559
00:47:08,766 --> 00:47:12,060
We're going to have a conversation.
Tell me what you did today.

560
00:47:14,605 --> 00:47:15,855
I got up.

561
00:47:17,149 --> 00:47:19,067
I fixed breakfast for my husband.

562
00:47:19,151 --> 00:47:23,071
There. There's something we could have
a conversation about. Your husband.

563
00:47:23,489 --> 00:47:24,906
Oh. Him.

564
00:47:25,324 --> 00:47:29,160
I mean, everything. I don't know
anything about how you work this.

565
00:47:29,453 --> 00:47:31,663
What do you say to him
when you leave the house at night?

566
00:47:31,747 --> 00:47:34,249
- Nothing. He's asleep.
- Always?

567
00:47:34,792 --> 00:47:36,751
Doesn't he wake up
when you come home?

568
00:47:38,629 --> 00:47:41,589
- We have separate bedrooms.
- Oh, I see.

569
00:47:42,758 --> 00:47:46,386
So you don't... I mean,
I don't like to seem like I'm prying,

570
00:47:46,429 --> 00:47:48,763
but I guess
you don't sleep together or anything.

571
00:47:48,806 --> 00:47:50,181
No, we don't.

572
00:47:50,433 --> 00:47:52,976
- Well, how long has this been going on?
- For God's sake, let's drop this.

573
00:47:53,060 --> 00:47:55,437
Well, wait a minute.
Why did you marry him?

574
00:47:56,313 --> 00:47:59,315
- See if you can guess.
- Well, I can't.

575
00:47:59,692 --> 00:48:01,943
Think real hard, Benjamin.

576
00:48:02,403 --> 00:48:04,446
I can't see why you did, unless...

577
00:48:05,031 --> 00:48:07,615
You didn't have to marry him
or anything, did you?

578
00:48:15,958 --> 00:48:17,709
Don't tell Elaine.

579
00:48:17,793 --> 00:48:20,920
Oh, no. You had to marry him
because you got pregnant.

580
00:48:20,963 --> 00:48:22,380
Are you shocked?

581
00:48:24,425 --> 00:48:27,217
Well, I never thought
of you and Mr. Robinson as the kind of...

582
00:48:27,302 --> 00:48:29,386
All right. Now let's get to bed.

583
00:48:29,471 --> 00:48:31,388
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

584
00:48:33,058 --> 00:48:35,267
- So how did it happen?
- What?

585
00:48:35,810 --> 00:48:37,061
You and Mr. Robinson.

586
00:48:37,145 --> 00:48:39,855
I mean, do you feel like telling me
what were the circumstances?

587
00:48:40,523 --> 00:48:42,274
Not particularly.

588
00:48:42,484 --> 00:48:44,985
Was he a law student at the time?

589
00:48:45,820 --> 00:48:47,988
And you were a student also?

590
00:48:49,949 --> 00:48:52,159
- At college?
- Yes.

591
00:48:53,703 --> 00:48:55,329
What was your major?

592
00:48:59,375 --> 00:49:02,669
Benjamin, why are you asking me
all these questions?

593
00:49:02,712 --> 00:49:04,838
Because I'm interested, Mrs. Robinson.

594
00:49:04,923 --> 00:49:07,424
Well, what was
your major subject at college?

595
00:49:09,511 --> 00:49:11,428
- Art.
- Art?

596
00:49:14,182 --> 00:49:15,682
But I thought you...

597
00:49:21,064 --> 00:49:24,525
I guess you kind of lost interest
in it over the years, then.

598
00:49:25,944 --> 00:49:27,194
Kind of.

599
00:49:29,656 --> 00:49:31,406
Well, how did it happen?

600
00:49:32,534 --> 00:49:34,868
- What?
- You and Mr. Robinson.

601
00:49:35,203 --> 00:49:36,537
How do you think?

602
00:49:36,579 --> 00:49:40,124
I mean did he take you up to his room
with him? Did you go to a hotel?

603
00:49:40,208 --> 00:49:42,292
Oh, Benjamin,
what does it possibly matter?

604
00:49:42,377 --> 00:49:45,587
- I'm curious.
- We'd go to his car.

605
00:49:45,797 --> 00:49:48,882
Oh, no. In the car you did it?

606
00:49:49,425 --> 00:49:51,051
Well, I don't think we were the first.

607
00:49:51,886 --> 00:49:53,595
What kind of car was it?

608
00:49:55,223 --> 00:49:56,515
What?

609
00:49:56,724 --> 00:49:58,809
Do you remember the make of the car?

610
00:49:59,352 --> 00:50:01,937
- Oh, my God.
- Really, I wanna know.

611
00:50:02,021 --> 00:50:04,189
It was a Ford, Benjamin.

612
00:50:04,399 --> 00:50:05,941
A Ford.

613
00:50:06,025 --> 00:50:09,194
A Ford. God damn it, that's great.

614
00:50:09,279 --> 00:50:12,114
- A Ford.
- That's enough.

615
00:50:15,743 --> 00:50:19,538
So old Elaine Robinson
got started in a Ford.

616
00:50:20,707 --> 00:50:24,209
- Don't talk about Elaine.
- Don't talk about Elaine?

617
00:50:25,003 --> 00:50:27,588
- No.
- Why not?

618
00:50:28,673 --> 00:50:30,257
'Cause I don't want you to.

619
00:50:30,341 --> 00:50:33,594
Well, why don't you? I wish you'd tell me.

620
00:50:33,803 --> 00:50:35,345
There's nothing to tell.

621
00:50:35,430 --> 00:50:38,557
Well, why is she
a big taboo subject all of a sudden?

622
00:50:39,475 --> 00:50:43,395
Well, I guess I'll have to ask her out
on a date and find out what the big deal is.

623
00:50:43,438 --> 00:50:48,817
Benjamin, don't you ever take
that girl out. Do you understand that?

624
00:50:49,110 --> 00:50:51,862
Look, I have no intention of taking her out.

625
00:50:54,115 --> 00:50:57,701
- Good.
- I was just kidding around.

626
00:51:01,122 --> 00:51:02,122
Good.

627
00:51:03,708 --> 00:51:05,250
Well, why shouldn't I?

628
00:51:09,589 --> 00:51:10,839
I have my reasons.

629
00:51:10,924 --> 00:51:12,466
- Then let's hear them.
- No.

630
00:51:12,508 --> 00:51:15,636
Let's hear them, Mrs. Robinson,
because I think I know what they are.

631
00:51:15,803 --> 00:51:18,263
I'm not good enough for her
to associate with, am I?

632
00:51:18,306 --> 00:51:20,974
I'm not good enough to even
talk about her, am I?

633
00:51:21,059 --> 00:51:22,517
- Let's drop it.
- We're not dropping it.

634
00:51:22,602 --> 00:51:24,394
I'm good enough for you,
but not I'm not good enough

635
00:51:24,479 --> 00:51:26,939
to associate with your daughter.
That's it, isn't it?

636
00:51:27,148 --> 00:51:28,440
Isn't it?

637
00:51:41,454 --> 00:51:42,996
Yes.

638
00:51:43,623 --> 00:51:46,833
You go to hell.
You go straight to hell, Mrs. Robinson.

639
00:51:46,918 --> 00:51:49,336
Do you think I'm proud of myself?
Do you think I'm proud of this?

640
00:51:49,379 --> 00:51:51,171
- I wouldn't know.
- Well, I am not.

641
00:51:51,214 --> 00:51:52,839
- You're not.
- No, sir.

642
00:51:53,633 --> 00:51:56,718
I'm not proud that I spend my time
with a broken-down alcoholic.

643
00:51:58,137 --> 00:51:59,680
- I see.
- And if you think I come here

644
00:51:59,722 --> 00:52:03,016
for any reason besides pure boredom,
then you're all wrong.

645
00:52:03,059 --> 00:52:06,019
Because, Mrs. Robinson,
this is the sickest, most perverted thing

646
00:52:06,062 --> 00:52:07,562
that ever happened to me.

647
00:52:07,647 --> 00:52:10,023
And you do what you want,
but I'm getting the hell out.

648
00:52:10,775 --> 00:52:13,694
- Are you?
- You're goddamn right I am.

649
00:52:16,531 --> 00:52:19,700
That's how you feel about me,
that I'm a sick and disgusting person?

650
00:52:19,784 --> 00:52:22,077
- Now don't start this.
- What?

651
00:52:22,578 --> 00:52:26,581
- Don't start acting hurt.
- Don't you expect me to be a little hurt?

652
00:52:26,666 --> 00:52:30,544
Mrs. Robinson, you lie there and tell me
I'm not good enough for your daughter.

653
00:52:30,628 --> 00:52:34,006
- Did I say that?
- In so many words.

654
00:52:35,508 --> 00:52:39,051
Benjamin, I want to apologize
if that's the impression you got.

655
00:52:39,094 --> 00:52:42,138
Well, two minutes ago, you told me
I wasn't good enough for your daughter.

656
00:52:42,222 --> 00:52:44,724
Now you say you're sorry
I got that impression.

657
00:52:44,766 --> 00:52:48,352
I didn't mean it. I don't think
you'd be right for each other.

658
00:52:49,187 --> 00:52:52,315
But I would never say you weren't
as good a person as she is.

659
00:52:53,859 --> 00:52:57,069
- You wouldn't?
- Of course I wouldn't.

660
00:53:02,409 --> 00:53:03,909
What are you doing?

661
00:53:03,994 --> 00:53:07,246
Well, it's pretty obvious
you don't want me around anymore.

662
00:53:09,624 --> 00:53:11,083
Well, look...

663
00:53:14,129 --> 00:53:16,088
I was kind of upset there.

664
00:53:17,549 --> 00:53:20,092
I'm sorry I said those things.

665
00:53:20,177 --> 00:53:24,722
It's all right. I think I can understand
why I'm disgusting to you.

666
00:53:25,432 --> 00:53:32,229
Oh. Look, I like you. I wouldn't
keep coming here if I didn't like you.

667
00:53:33,023 --> 00:53:35,983
- But if it's sickening for you?
- It's not.

668
00:53:39,571 --> 00:53:41,155
I enjoy it. I look forward to it.

669
00:53:41,239 --> 00:53:43,991
It's the one thing I have
to look forward to.

670
00:53:45,702 --> 00:53:47,453
You don't have to say that.

671
00:53:47,496 --> 00:53:51,374
Well, I wouldn't.
I would never say it if it wasn't true.

672
00:53:51,958 --> 00:53:53,709
Well, may I stay, then?

673
00:53:56,463 --> 00:53:58,339
Yes, please. I want you to.

674
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:01,008
Thank you.

675
00:54:01,093 --> 00:54:04,178
Well, don't thank me
because I want you to.

676
00:54:06,306 --> 00:54:08,474
But you won't ever
take Elaine out, will you?

677
00:54:08,558 --> 00:54:10,476
I want you to promise me that.

678
00:54:10,977 --> 00:54:12,645
Look, why the hell did you bring this up?

679
00:54:12,687 --> 00:54:14,271
It never occurred to me to take her out.

680
00:54:14,314 --> 00:54:16,315
Then give me your word you won't.

681
00:54:17,150 --> 00:54:20,945
- This is absurd.
- Promise me, Benjamin.

682
00:54:22,114 --> 00:54:23,572
All right, I promise.

683
00:54:23,657 --> 00:54:27,076
For Christ's sake, I promise
I'll never take out Elaine Robinson.

684
00:54:29,496 --> 00:54:30,871
Thank you.

685
00:54:36,128 --> 00:54:38,504
- Benjamin...
- Let's not talk about it.

686
00:54:40,006 --> 00:54:41,841
Let's not talk at all.

687
00:55:18,003 --> 00:55:19,795
Elaine's back from school.

688
00:55:20,881 --> 00:55:23,674
I think it might be a nice gesture
if you asked her out.

689
00:55:37,731 --> 00:55:39,648
I suppose she's not good enough for you.
Is that it?

690
00:55:39,733 --> 00:55:42,234
Look, Elaine Robinson and I
do not get along.

691
00:55:42,277 --> 00:55:45,154
How do you know?
You haven't seen her since high school.

692
00:55:45,238 --> 00:55:47,948
I suppose your evenings,
whatever you do with them,

693
00:55:48,033 --> 00:55:49,575
are just too valuable.

694
00:55:49,659 --> 00:55:51,577
That has nothing to do with it.

695
00:55:51,703 --> 00:55:53,579
I guess I'll just have to tell Mr. Robinson

696
00:55:53,663 --> 00:55:57,458
that you're too busy every evening
doing God knows what.

697
00:55:57,542 --> 00:55:59,793
Now don't go on like this.

698
00:56:00,212 --> 00:56:03,172
If Benjamin absolutely refuses
to take her out...

699
00:56:03,256 --> 00:56:04,298
I do.

700
00:56:04,382 --> 00:56:09,595
...then I will simply have to invite
all the Robinsons over on Thursday.

701
00:56:21,733 --> 00:56:24,818
Well, Braddock,
it's about time you got around to this.

702
00:56:25,779 --> 00:56:27,863
Your wife predicted you
would say what?

703
00:56:27,948 --> 00:56:29,114
Patty Duvalle.

704
00:56:32,702 --> 00:56:34,495
That I didn't know...

705
00:56:35,747 --> 00:56:38,040
- No points, right?
- No.

706
00:56:38,124 --> 00:56:39,375
Here's the next question. Gentlemen.

707
00:56:40,043 --> 00:56:41,043
Hello.

708
00:56:41,127 --> 00:56:43,462
What is your wife's
most unusual habit?

709
00:56:43,547 --> 00:56:44,964
Come on in.

710
00:56:45,048 --> 00:56:48,466
I'm afraid the young lady
isn't quite ready yet.

711
00:56:49,385 --> 00:56:51,469
Here, what would you say to a short one?

712
00:56:51,512 --> 00:56:53,972
- Scotch still your drink?
- Bourbon.

713
00:56:54,557 --> 00:56:57,892
Can you think
of something before that bell rings?

714
00:56:59,436 --> 00:57:00,937
Not shaving her legs.

715
00:57:05,109 --> 00:57:06,276
Gosh.

716
00:57:10,155 --> 00:57:12,865
Well, I'll see if she's ready.

717
00:57:15,536 --> 00:57:17,662
I don't even wanna play anymore.

718
00:57:18,539 --> 00:57:19,956
Sorry, honey, I...

719
00:57:20,416 --> 00:57:23,167
Well, what else could... What did she say?

720
00:57:23,210 --> 00:57:26,546
Listen, this was not my idea.
This was my father's idea.

721
00:57:26,630 --> 00:57:29,465
Benjamin, I thought I made myself
perfectly clear about this.

722
00:57:29,508 --> 00:57:33,177
Look, we'll go out to dinner and have
a drink, and I'll bring her right back,

723
00:57:33,262 --> 00:57:36,180
because it was either that
or a dinner party for the two families,

724
00:57:36,223 --> 00:57:39,309
and I'm afraid I couldn't quite handle that,
if you don't mind.

725
00:57:40,436 --> 00:57:42,103
Look, I have no intention of ever taking

726
00:57:42,187 --> 00:57:44,147
your precious daughter out again
in her life,

727
00:57:44,189 --> 00:57:45,773
so don't get upset about it.

728
00:57:45,858 --> 00:57:49,944
I am. I'm extremely
upset about it, Benjamin.

729
00:57:51,822 --> 00:57:54,407
- Hello.
- Hello.

730
00:57:54,992 --> 00:57:57,785
Well, I want you to keep
your wits about you tonight.

731
00:57:57,870 --> 00:58:02,040
You never know what tricks
Ben picked up back there in the East.

732
00:58:12,801 --> 00:58:14,844
You're living at home now, is that right?

733
00:58:14,887 --> 00:58:16,137
Yes.

734
00:58:17,306 --> 00:58:20,224
- Do you know what you're going to do?
- No.

735
00:58:23,729 --> 00:58:27,148
- Are you going to graduate school?
- No.

736
00:58:33,447 --> 00:58:36,574
- Do you always drive like this?
- Yes.

737
01:00:01,326 --> 01:00:02,785
Sit down.

738
01:00:17,718 --> 01:00:19,677
Why don't you watch the show?

739
01:00:23,849 --> 01:00:26,476
Benjamin, do you dislike me
for some reason?

740
01:00:26,518 --> 01:00:28,603
No. Why should I?

741
01:00:29,772 --> 01:00:31,105
I don't know.

742
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:42,366
You're missing a great effect here.

743
01:00:43,786 --> 01:00:45,536
Go, go!

744
01:00:45,621 --> 01:00:47,163
How do you like that?

745
01:00:50,375 --> 01:00:51,793
Could you do it?

746
01:00:55,339 --> 01:00:57,047
Go, baby, go!

747
01:01:14,565 --> 01:01:15,607
Stop!

748
01:01:15,691 --> 01:01:17,025
Hey!

749
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:27,828
Elaine, I'm sorry.

750
01:01:28,412 --> 01:01:29,704
Elaine.

751
01:01:30,915 --> 01:01:34,292
- Would you take me home now?
- I'm sorry I took you in there.

752
01:01:34,377 --> 01:01:36,711
I think I'd better go home, please.

753
01:01:41,551 --> 01:01:43,051
Elaine.

754
01:01:43,386 --> 01:01:46,346
- Where's the car?
- I just want to tell you something.

755
01:01:50,184 --> 01:01:53,603
- I want to go home.
- But can I just tell you this one thing?

756
01:01:55,022 --> 01:01:56,857
- What?
- This whole idea, this date and everything,

757
01:01:56,941 --> 01:01:59,943
it was my parents' idea.
They forced me into it.

758
01:01:59,986 --> 01:02:02,571
Oh, that's very nice of you to tell me.

759
01:02:02,738 --> 01:02:04,739
No, what I mean is that's why
I've been acting this way.

760
01:02:04,782 --> 01:02:07,784
I'm not like this. I hate myself like this.

761
01:02:11,706 --> 01:02:13,957
Listen, could you just stop crying, please?

762
01:02:14,041 --> 01:02:15,417
No, I couldn't.

763
01:02:15,459 --> 01:02:17,544
- But could you try?
- No.

764
01:02:31,976 --> 01:02:34,477
I've had this feeling
ever since I've graduated,

765
01:02:34,520 --> 01:02:36,938
this kind of compulsion
that I have to be rude all the time,

766
01:02:36,981 --> 01:02:38,356
you know what I mean?

767
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:43,111
Yes, I do.

768
01:02:43,321 --> 01:02:45,405
It's like I've been
playing some kind of game,

769
01:02:45,489 --> 01:02:47,991
but the rules don't make any sense to me.

770
01:02:48,284 --> 01:02:50,702
They're being made up
by all the wrong people.

771
01:02:50,786 --> 01:02:53,580
No. I mean, no one makes them up.

772
01:02:53,664 --> 01:02:55,874
They seem to have made themselves up.

773
01:02:57,585 --> 01:03:01,880
Say, I wonder if I could request
you to turn that down a little?

774
01:03:52,765 --> 01:03:54,265
Would you like to come in?

775
01:03:55,351 --> 01:03:56,935
I could make you some coffee.

776
01:03:57,019 --> 01:04:00,480
No. I mean, I wouldn't want
to wake anyone up.

777
01:04:01,273 --> 01:04:04,025
We won't. Let's go inside.

778
01:04:05,236 --> 01:04:07,654
- Wait a minute.
- Is anything wrong?

779
01:04:07,738 --> 01:04:10,865
No. I was just thinking.

780
01:04:11,784 --> 01:04:16,329
It's still early. Maybe we could
do something, go somewhere else.

781
01:04:17,915 --> 01:04:19,124
All right.

782
01:04:26,549 --> 01:04:28,091
Where are we going?

783
01:04:28,134 --> 01:04:30,969
I'm trying to think of where there's
a place to have a drink around here.

784
01:04:31,053 --> 01:04:33,430
Isn't there one at the Taft Hotel?

785
01:04:34,598 --> 01:04:36,266
What is the matter?

786
01:04:36,350 --> 01:04:40,020
Nothing. I'm just wondering
if they have a bar or not.

787
01:04:40,104 --> 01:04:43,189
I mean, let's go see.
Let's go see if they do or not.

788
01:04:45,359 --> 01:04:47,652
Listen, Elaine, it seems to me
that there isn't a bar here.

789
01:04:47,737 --> 01:04:48,820
I mean, as far as I know.

790
01:04:48,904 --> 01:04:51,531
Of course there is. Look.
There's the Palm Room right there.

791
01:04:51,615 --> 01:04:53,033
Good evening.

792
01:04:53,117 --> 01:04:54,826
Hello. How are you, sir?

793
01:04:54,910 --> 01:04:57,954
- Good evening, Mr. Gladstone.
- Hello again.

794
01:04:59,832 --> 01:05:02,751
Hi, Mr. Gladstone.
How are you this evening?

795
01:05:04,462 --> 01:05:05,920
Benjamin?

796
01:05:06,296 --> 01:05:08,255
Let's get out of here, Elaine.
Let's go somewhere else.

797
01:05:08,298 --> 01:05:10,132
- Do they know you?
- Of course not.

798
01:05:10,216 --> 01:05:13,010
- Good evening, sir.
- Come on, Elaine. We're leaving.

799
01:05:15,180 --> 01:05:17,139
Mr. Gladstone, how are you?

800
01:05:17,766 --> 01:05:19,266
- Benjamin, what's happening?
- I don't know.

801
01:05:19,309 --> 01:05:21,351
They must think I look
like this guy Gladstone.

802
01:05:21,436 --> 01:05:23,270
Hello, Mr. Braniff.

803
01:05:35,825 --> 01:05:39,328
Elaine, I like you. I like you so much.

804
01:05:40,705 --> 01:05:41,955
Do you believe that?

805
01:05:46,086 --> 01:05:48,045
- Do you?
- Yes.

806
01:05:50,173 --> 01:05:51,632
You're the first...

807
01:05:53,218 --> 01:05:56,178
You're the first thing for so long
that I've liked.

808
01:05:57,055 --> 01:05:59,348
The first person I could stand to be with.

809
01:06:02,018 --> 01:06:04,853
My whole life is such a waste.

810
01:06:06,481 --> 01:06:08,107
It's just nothing.

811
01:06:12,237 --> 01:06:15,155
I'm sorry. I'll take you home now.

812
01:06:18,660 --> 01:06:21,703
Benjamin, are you having
an affair with someone?

813
01:06:27,544 --> 01:06:28,836
I'm sorry.

814
01:06:29,212 --> 01:06:31,255
I'm sorry. That's not my business.

815
01:06:32,173 --> 01:06:33,882
It just happened.

816
01:06:35,927 --> 01:06:39,888
It was just this thing that happened
along with everything else.

817
01:06:41,057 --> 01:06:42,808
Can you understand that?

818
01:06:44,227 --> 01:06:46,019
Was she married or something?

819
01:06:47,772 --> 01:06:48,939
Yes.

820
01:06:49,983 --> 01:06:51,859
With a family?

821
01:06:51,901 --> 01:06:54,027
Yes. She had a husband and a son.

822
01:06:55,738 --> 01:06:58,532
- Did they ever find out?
- No.

823
01:07:02,036 --> 01:07:03,620
And it's all over now?

824
01:07:06,749 --> 01:07:07,916
Yes.

825
01:07:14,841 --> 01:07:16,258
I'm glad.

826
01:07:26,728 --> 01:07:28,979
Can we do
something tomorrow?

827
01:07:29,063 --> 01:07:30,272
All right.

828
01:07:31,107 --> 01:07:33,650
During the day, we'll go
for a drive or something.

829
01:07:33,735 --> 01:07:35,319
Okay.

830
01:07:35,403 --> 01:07:38,280
- You sure you really want to?
- Yes.

831
01:07:38,323 --> 01:07:40,616
'Cause I wouldn't want you
to do it unless you really wanted to.

832
01:07:40,658 --> 01:07:42,743
- I do.
- You do?

833
01:07:43,620 --> 01:07:44,786
Benjamin, I really do.

834
01:08:17,070 --> 01:08:18,654
Drive down the block.

835
01:08:18,696 --> 01:08:22,866
Mrs. Robinson, Elaine and I have a date.
We're going for a drive.

836
01:08:22,951 --> 01:08:25,035
Do exactly as I say.

837
01:08:31,918 --> 01:08:35,337
- Now, it seems to me...
- Listen to me very carefully, Benjamin.

838
01:08:35,546 --> 01:08:39,174
You are not to see Elaine again ever.
Those are my orders. Is that clear?

839
01:08:39,217 --> 01:08:42,511
- Mrs. Robinson, do you think...
- I can make things quite unpleasant.

840
01:08:42,595 --> 01:08:44,179
How?

841
01:08:44,514 --> 01:08:48,684
In order to keep Elaine away from you,
I am prepared to tell her everything.

842
01:08:51,479 --> 01:08:52,854
I don't believe you.

843
01:08:53,690 --> 01:08:55,774
Then you better start believing me.

844
01:08:55,858 --> 01:08:58,068
I just don't believe you would do that.

845
01:08:58,945 --> 01:09:00,404
Try me.

846
01:09:05,201 --> 01:09:07,327
God damn it.

847
01:09:17,546 --> 01:09:18,546
Elaine!

848
01:09:18,630 --> 01:09:21,465
- Elaine! I'm coming up!
Benjamin?

849
01:09:21,550 --> 01:09:23,259
I'm not dressed yet.

850
01:09:23,885 --> 01:09:26,512
- Benjamin, I said I wasn't dressed.
- You've got to go over the back fence

851
01:09:26,555 --> 01:09:28,597
- and I'll meet you round the corner.
- What's the matter?

852
01:09:28,682 --> 01:09:30,224
Hurry. Put your shoes on.

853
01:09:32,144 --> 01:09:33,561
Benjamin.

854
01:09:33,645 --> 01:09:35,730
- Benjamin, what are you doing?
- Elaine?

855
01:09:35,814 --> 01:09:38,441
- Elaine, I have to tell you something.
- What is it?

856
01:09:38,525 --> 01:09:39,692
- That woman...
- What?

857
01:09:39,735 --> 01:09:41,569
That woman,
that older woman that I told you about?

858
01:09:41,653 --> 01:09:43,779
- You mean that one?
- Yes, the married woman.

859
01:09:43,864 --> 01:09:46,949
- That wasn't just some woman.
- What are you telling me?

860
01:09:47,034 --> 01:09:49,702
Benjamin, will you just tell me
what this is all about?

861
01:10:04,384 --> 01:10:06,469
- Oh, no.
- Elaine.

862
01:10:06,887 --> 01:10:09,180
- Oh, my God.
- Please.

863
01:10:09,639 --> 01:10:12,183
- Get out of here.
- Don't cry.

864
01:10:12,434 --> 01:10:14,393
Get out! Get out!

865
01:10:14,436 --> 01:10:15,811
Out! Get out!

866
01:10:21,443 --> 01:10:23,069
Goodbye, Benjamin.

867
01:12:20,729 --> 01:12:22,563
Say that again.

868
01:12:22,647 --> 01:12:24,732
I'm going to marry Elaine Robinson.

869
01:12:30,238 --> 01:12:34,033
- Well, well, well.
- What's happening?

870
01:12:34,534 --> 01:12:37,870
Ben says that he and Elaine
are getting married.

871
01:12:39,581 --> 01:12:42,875
- I don't believe it.
- That's what he says, right?

872
01:12:42,918 --> 01:12:44,585
I'm going up to Berkeley today.

873
01:12:44,669 --> 01:12:48,547
Oh, Ben, that's so exciting.

874
01:12:49,424 --> 01:12:51,342
Here, come on.
We've got to call the Robinsons.

875
01:12:51,426 --> 01:12:53,010
We've got something to celebrate.

876
01:12:53,094 --> 01:12:56,096
- No, I think you'll want to wait on that.
- They don't know?

877
01:12:56,181 --> 01:12:57,515
No, they don't.

878
01:12:57,599 --> 01:13:00,476
- Well, when did you decide all this?
- About an hour ago.

879
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:03,604
Wait a minute.
You talked to Elaine this morning?

880
01:13:03,688 --> 01:13:05,564
No. She doesn't know about it.

881
01:13:06,066 --> 01:13:08,817
You mean she doesn't know
that you're coming up to Berkeley?

882
01:13:08,902 --> 01:13:12,112
No. Actually, she doesn't know
about us getting married yet.

883
01:13:12,614 --> 01:13:14,281
Well, when did you two talk this over?

884
01:13:14,324 --> 01:13:16,909
- We haven't.
- You haven't?

885
01:13:17,661 --> 01:13:21,288
Ben, this whole idea
sounds pretty half-baked.

886
01:13:21,373 --> 01:13:25,334
No. It's not. It's completely baked.
It's a decision I've made.

887
01:13:25,460 --> 01:13:27,544
Well, what makes you think
she wants to marry you?

888
01:13:27,628 --> 01:13:31,089
She doesn't. To be perfectly honest,
she doesn't like me.

889
01:16:44,158 --> 01:16:45,491
- You a student?
- Not exactly.

890
01:16:45,576 --> 01:16:48,745
- What's that?
- I said not exactly. No.

891
01:16:49,830 --> 01:16:53,541
- What are you then?
- Oh, I'm just sort of traveling through.

892
01:16:55,419 --> 01:16:57,962
I like to know who's living in my house.

893
01:16:58,005 --> 01:17:00,590
I like to know what my boys are up to.

894
01:17:01,216 --> 01:17:06,012
I'm not up to much, actually.
I'm just visiting.

895
01:17:08,724 --> 01:17:11,350
I mean, I've always wanted
to see Berkeley.

896
01:17:14,813 --> 01:17:16,439
- You're not one of those agitators?
- What?

897
01:17:16,523 --> 01:17:17,982
- One of those outside agitators?
- Oh, no.

898
01:17:18,025 --> 01:17:19,859
I hate that. I won't stand for it.

899
01:17:20,360 --> 01:17:22,862
I won't stand for that.

900
01:18:49,282 --> 01:18:50,615
Excuse me.

901
01:18:52,451 --> 01:18:53,785
Pardon me.

902
01:18:58,791 --> 01:19:01,751
Well, how about this for a coincidence?

903
01:19:07,300 --> 01:19:09,342
I was wondering where you were headed.

904
01:19:10,094 --> 01:19:13,096
- I'm meeting someone.
- Where?

905
01:19:16,309 --> 01:19:18,184
Where are you meeting this person?

906
01:19:18,269 --> 01:19:21,104
- At the zoo.
- The zoo.

907
01:19:21,814 --> 01:19:24,065
They have a pretty good one here,
do they?

908
01:19:25,318 --> 01:19:29,362
- I don't know. I've never seen it.
- Oh. Well, I haven't, either.

909
01:19:31,657 --> 01:19:33,950
I might just ride out there with you.

910
01:19:38,205 --> 01:19:40,790
Is that him over there?
No.

911
01:19:44,337 --> 01:19:46,087
Where did he say
he was going to meet you?

912
01:19:46,172 --> 01:19:48,131
I thought he said by the monkey house.

913
01:19:49,425 --> 01:19:51,843
Benjamin, I would like to know
what you're doing here.

914
01:19:51,928 --> 01:19:54,262
- Here? In Berkeley?
- Yes.

915
01:19:54,347 --> 01:19:56,723
Well, I have this very pleasant room
on Carter Street,

916
01:19:56,807 --> 01:19:57,974
and I've been getting to some classes.

917
01:19:58,017 --> 01:20:00,268
- But you're not enrolled.
- No, I just sit in.

918
01:20:00,353 --> 01:20:03,647
They don't seem to mind.
They've been very congenial about it.

919
01:20:03,689 --> 01:20:06,524
Benjamin, you're...
I don't know what to say.

920
01:20:06,609 --> 01:20:09,569
Maybe we can get together
sometime and talk about it.

921
01:20:09,654 --> 01:20:11,196
Really incredible.

922
01:20:13,532 --> 01:20:15,450
- Here he comes.
- What?

923
01:20:15,618 --> 01:20:18,370
I've got a real feeling that this is the fella.

924
01:20:19,830 --> 01:20:20,872
Elaine.

925
01:20:20,915 --> 01:20:22,707
He certainly is a good walker.

926
01:20:23,626 --> 01:20:24,918
Am I late? I'm sorry.

927
01:20:25,002 --> 01:20:27,087
We thought you said
by the monkey house.

928
01:20:27,713 --> 01:20:30,382
This is Benjamin Braddock. Carl Smith.

929
01:20:30,424 --> 01:20:32,425
Benjamin rode here with me on the bus.

930
01:20:32,510 --> 01:20:35,303
- Glad to meet you, Ben.
- Great meeting you, Carl.

931
01:20:35,388 --> 01:20:36,888
Swell seeing you.

932
01:21:20,599 --> 01:21:21,975
Who is it?

933
01:21:22,601 --> 01:21:24,644
I wanna ask you a question,
and then I'm going.

934
01:21:24,729 --> 01:21:26,312
- Come in.
- No.

935
01:21:26,397 --> 01:21:28,106
I wanna know why you're here in Berkeley.

936
01:21:28,190 --> 01:21:29,858
Because I am.

937
01:21:30,234 --> 01:21:32,610
- Is it because I'm here?
- What do you think?

938
01:21:32,695 --> 01:21:36,197
I think it is. I said I think it is.

939
01:21:36,282 --> 01:21:38,825
- All right, then. Yes.
- Well, I want you to leave.

940
01:21:38,909 --> 01:21:40,660
Well, look, I love you.

941
01:21:40,745 --> 01:21:43,371
How could you do that, Benjamin?
Do you just hate everything?

942
01:21:43,456 --> 01:21:45,165
How could you possibly rape my mother?

943
01:21:45,249 --> 01:21:46,416
- What?
- I don't understand.

944
01:21:46,459 --> 01:21:48,333
- Did you say rape her?
- I don't understand how anyone could...

945
01:21:48,418 --> 01:21:50,461
What did she say?
You've got to tell me what she said.

946
01:21:50,545 --> 01:21:52,212
- Why?
- Because it isn't true.

947
01:21:52,297 --> 01:21:54,381
- I have to go.
- Tell me.

948
01:21:54,466 --> 01:21:56,967
She said that she was having a drink
at the hotel with a friend

949
01:21:57,010 --> 01:21:59,136
and that you waited for her
in the parking lot

950
01:21:59,220 --> 01:22:01,472
and told her
that she was too drunk to drive home,

951
01:22:01,514 --> 01:22:03,974
and that you would get her
a room for the night.

952
01:22:04,059 --> 01:22:05,476
Well, then what?

953
01:22:05,518 --> 01:22:07,269
Then you took her upstairs
and you raped her.

954
01:22:07,312 --> 01:22:09,646
Oh, no, no. That's not what happened.

955
01:22:09,731 --> 01:22:12,316
What happened was that there was
this party at my parents'.

956
01:22:12,358 --> 01:22:13,484
I drove your mother home.

957
01:22:13,526 --> 01:22:15,110
- I don't want to hear this!
- Then we went upstairs

958
01:22:15,153 --> 01:22:17,196
- to see your portrait. When we got up...
- No, I don't!

959
01:22:17,280 --> 01:22:19,656
...she started taking her clothes off...
- This is my mother, Benjamin.

960
01:22:19,741 --> 01:22:23,827
...and suddenly, there she was without
any clothes on. I mean, really naked.

961
01:22:31,836 --> 01:22:33,337
MR. McCLEERY: What's going on in there?

962
01:22:39,302 --> 01:22:41,470
- Oh, hello, Mr. McCleery.
- Who screamed?

963
01:22:41,513 --> 01:22:43,097
It's all right, Mr. McCleery.

964
01:22:43,181 --> 01:22:45,724
Screaming is not all right.
Not in my house, it isn't.

965
01:22:45,809 --> 01:22:48,519
It was just a visitor, but it's all right now.

966
01:22:50,522 --> 01:22:52,689
- What'd you do to her?
- Look, she's all right.

967
01:22:52,774 --> 01:22:55,359
She's upset, and she screamed,
but it's okay now.

968
01:22:55,401 --> 01:22:56,568
- Shall I get the cops?
- What?

969
01:22:56,653 --> 01:22:58,821
- I'll get the cops.
- Hey, wait a minute.

970
01:22:58,863 --> 01:23:02,991
Now, damn it, look.
Here she is, having some water.

971
01:23:04,077 --> 01:23:06,120
Now, there's no need
for the cops or anything.

972
01:23:06,204 --> 01:23:09,665
All right, boys.
You can all go back to your rooms now.

973
01:23:09,707 --> 01:23:13,585
Go ahead. We won't have
any more of this agitation.

974
01:23:15,380 --> 01:23:17,256
- Will we, Braddock?
- No, sir.

975
01:23:20,718 --> 01:23:22,427
I want you out of here.

976
01:23:22,804 --> 01:23:24,930
- What do you mean?
- Now, you heard me, out of here.

977
01:23:25,014 --> 01:23:27,558
- What for?
- Because I don't like you.

978
01:24:00,091 --> 01:24:01,800
I'm sorry I screamed.

979
01:24:06,472 --> 01:24:08,599
Benjamin, when you came up here,

980
01:24:08,641 --> 01:24:11,268
what did you think was going
to happen between us?

981
01:24:12,937 --> 01:24:15,189
Elaine, right now,
I don't feel like talking much.

982
01:24:15,273 --> 01:24:18,692
I'm sorry about everything,
but I think I'll just do this now.

983
01:24:30,538 --> 01:24:32,748
Can I just sit here while you're packing?

984
01:24:33,041 --> 01:24:34,625
If you want.

985
01:24:47,889 --> 01:24:49,890
What are you going to do now?

986
01:24:51,059 --> 01:24:52,601
I don't know.

987
01:24:53,436 --> 01:24:55,646
- Are you going home?
- No.

988
01:24:55,813 --> 01:24:57,689
Well, where are you going?

989
01:25:01,611 --> 01:25:04,613
Elaine, you're gonna have
to stop asking me that.

990
01:25:17,126 --> 01:25:19,378
I don't want you to leave tomorrow.

991
01:25:21,923 --> 01:25:23,507
I don't understand.

992
01:25:23,800 --> 01:25:26,134
I don't want you to go anywhere

993
01:25:28,680 --> 01:25:31,014
until you have a definite plan.

994
01:25:31,599 --> 01:25:32,933
Goodbye.

995
01:26:09,052 --> 01:26:10,386
What's happening?

996
01:26:10,429 --> 01:26:11,929
Benjamin?
- What?

997
01:26:18,228 --> 01:26:19,603
Will you kiss me?

998
01:26:47,424 --> 01:26:48,924
Will you marry me?

999
01:26:52,179 --> 01:26:54,930
- You won't?
- I don't know.

1000
01:26:58,643 --> 01:27:02,188
- But you might?
- I might.

1001
01:27:02,856 --> 01:27:06,108
Is that so? You might marry me?

1002
01:27:06,526 --> 01:27:07,735
Yes.

1003
01:27:08,528 --> 01:27:09,737
When?

1004
01:27:11,031 --> 01:27:12,448
I don't know.

1005
01:27:12,824 --> 01:27:15,618
How about tomorrow?
I don't mean to be pushy, but I think...

1006
01:27:15,702 --> 01:27:20,039
I don't know.
I don't know what's happening.

1007
01:27:22,125 --> 01:27:23,584
You mean you're confused?

1008
01:27:26,713 --> 01:27:28,672
Look, don't be confused.

1009
01:27:29,424 --> 01:27:30,925
We're getting married.

1010
01:27:32,761 --> 01:27:34,178
I don't see how we can.

1011
01:27:37,808 --> 01:27:39,141
We just can.

1012
01:27:46,691 --> 01:27:48,275
I have to go now.

1013
01:27:49,945 --> 01:27:54,115
Elaine? Are you serious about this?

1014
01:27:55,784 --> 01:27:57,368
I'll think about it.

1015
01:27:57,452 --> 01:27:59,662
- You really will?
- Yes.

1016
01:28:12,801 --> 01:28:14,260
Good God.

1017
01:28:16,346 --> 01:28:18,305
We can go down
and get our blood tests tomorrow.

1018
01:28:18,348 --> 01:28:21,016
Tomorrow?
- Or this afternoon. It's a good day for it.

1019
01:28:21,059 --> 01:28:23,519
Benjamin, I haven't even said
I'll marry you yet.

1020
01:28:23,562 --> 01:28:27,898
We'll need our birth certificates. I happen
to have mine with me. Where's yours?

1021
01:28:28,483 --> 01:28:31,026
- I just don't think it would work.
- Why wouldn't it?

1022
01:28:42,706 --> 01:28:45,708
- Why wouldn't it?
- I just don't think it would.

1023
01:28:47,252 --> 01:28:50,671
Tomorrow then. Can we get
our blood tests tomorrow morning?

1024
01:28:51,465 --> 01:28:54,550
Why don't you just drag me off
if you want to marry me so much?

1025
01:28:54,593 --> 01:28:56,635
Why don't I just drag you off?

1026
01:28:56,720 --> 01:29:00,389
All right, I will.
Right after we get the blood tests.

1027
01:29:00,474 --> 01:29:03,476
- I have to see Carl first.
- Carl who?

1028
01:29:07,230 --> 01:29:08,731
Carl who?

1029
01:29:09,274 --> 01:29:12,485
Carl Smith. He's a medical student.
We've known him for years.

1030
01:29:12,569 --> 01:29:14,487
- Who, that guy at the zoo?
- Yes.

1031
01:29:14,571 --> 01:29:17,907
- Why do you have to see him?
- Well, I said I might marry him.

1032
01:29:19,659 --> 01:29:21,368
You what?

1033
01:29:21,870 --> 01:29:24,747
How did he do it?
Did he get down on his knees?

1034
01:29:25,081 --> 01:29:26,916
He didn't get down on his knees, I hope.

1035
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:30,294
- No, Benjamin.
- Well, what did he say? I'm curious.

1036
01:29:32,255 --> 01:29:35,674
He said he thought
we'd make a pretty good team.

1037
01:29:35,759 --> 01:29:37,510
Oh, no. He said that?

1038
01:29:38,803 --> 01:29:40,387
Well, where did he do it?

1039
01:29:42,224 --> 01:29:44,058
I'd like to know where it happened.

1040
01:29:47,270 --> 01:29:49,605
It wasn't in his car, was it?

1041
01:30:02,869 --> 01:30:03,953
Good night.

1042
01:30:04,621 --> 01:30:08,206
- Are we getting married tomorrow?
- No.

1043
01:30:09,917 --> 01:30:14,254
- The day after tomorrow?
- I don't know.

1044
01:30:14,296 --> 01:30:16,714
Maybe we are and maybe we're not.

1045
01:31:07,016 --> 01:31:10,643
Do you want to... You want to try
and tell me why you did it?

1046
01:31:12,271 --> 01:31:13,605
Mr. Robinson.

1047
01:31:13,689 --> 01:31:15,565
Do you have a special grudge against me?

1048
01:31:15,649 --> 01:31:17,859
Do you feel
a particularly strong resentment?

1049
01:31:17,901 --> 01:31:18,943
No.

1050
01:31:19,028 --> 01:31:21,029
Is there something I've said
that's caused this contempt,

1051
01:31:21,113 --> 01:31:24,157
or is it just the things
I stand for that you despise?

1052
01:31:24,199 --> 01:31:25,908
It was nothing to do with you, sir.

1053
01:31:25,993 --> 01:31:28,870
Well, Ben, it was
quite a bit to do with me.

1054
01:31:28,912 --> 01:31:30,455
Now, look, please...

1055
01:31:30,539 --> 01:31:32,373
Ben, I think
we're two civilized human beings.

1056
01:31:32,416 --> 01:31:34,500
Do you think it's necessary
to threaten each other?

1057
01:31:34,543 --> 01:31:35,793
I am not threatening you.

1058
01:31:35,878 --> 01:31:38,880
Do you want to unclench
your fist, please? Thank you.

1059
01:31:39,006 --> 01:31:41,841
I can see in the dark, you know.
I've been here quite a while.

1060
01:31:41,884 --> 01:31:45,219
I'm trying to tell you I have no personal
feelings about you, Mr. Robinson.

1061
01:31:45,304 --> 01:31:47,221
I'm trying to tell you I do not resent you.

1062
01:31:47,306 --> 01:31:49,807
You don't respect me
terribly much either, do you?

1063
01:31:51,018 --> 01:31:52,852
- No, sir.
- What?

1064
01:31:52,895 --> 01:31:55,188
- No, sir...
- Don't shout at me, Ben.

1065
01:31:55,230 --> 01:31:57,815
I may not be as young as you,
but I still have pretty good hearing.

1066
01:31:57,900 --> 01:32:01,277
- Mr. Robinson...
- Have the decency to wait until I finish.

1067
01:32:02,696 --> 01:32:05,406
I do think you should know
the consequences of what you've done.

1068
01:32:05,449 --> 01:32:09,077
I do think you should know that
my wife and I are getting a divorce soon.

1069
01:32:09,161 --> 01:32:11,788
- But why?
- Why?

1070
01:32:12,122 --> 01:32:17,710
Listen to me. What happened between
Mrs. Robinson and me was nothing.

1071
01:32:17,753 --> 01:32:22,840
It didn't mean anything. We might
just as well have been shaking hands.

1072
01:32:22,925 --> 01:32:26,886
Shaking hands. Well, that's not
saying much for my wife, is it?

1073
01:32:26,929 --> 01:32:29,097
- You miss the point.
- I guess I do.

1074
01:32:29,139 --> 01:32:32,266
The point is I don't love your wife.
I love your daughter, sir.

1075
01:32:33,394 --> 01:32:35,269
All right. Now, listen to this.

1076
01:32:35,479 --> 01:32:38,398
I don't know whether
I can prosecute, but I think I can.

1077
01:32:38,440 --> 01:32:42,276
I think I can get you behind bars
if you ever look at my daughter again.

1078
01:32:42,611 --> 01:32:45,530
Now, I've seen Elaine, and I've made
damn sure you can't get to her.

1079
01:32:45,614 --> 01:32:47,573
Stay away from me, Ben.

1080
01:32:48,701 --> 01:32:50,451
I don't want to mince words with you.

1081
01:32:50,494 --> 01:32:54,622
As far as Elaine is concerned, you're to
get her out of your filthy mind right now.

1082
01:32:54,790 --> 01:32:56,874
Is that perfectly clear to you?

1083
01:32:57,251 --> 01:33:01,838
And that's all, Ben. You'll pardon me
if I don't shake hands with you.

1084
01:33:03,674 --> 01:33:05,425
I think you are filth.

1085
01:33:05,968 --> 01:33:07,969
I think you are scum.

1086
01:33:09,847 --> 01:33:11,723
You are a degenerate!

1087
01:33:17,646 --> 01:33:18,855
Hi.

1088
01:33:21,483 --> 01:33:24,652
Mr. McCleery, do you have some change?
I need to use the phone.

1089
01:33:24,695 --> 01:33:26,362
I want you out of here.

1090
01:33:26,447 --> 01:33:28,823
Look, I'll give you $10 for a dime.

1091
01:33:28,949 --> 01:33:32,994
I'll give you $20. For God's sake,
will you let me use that phone?

1092
01:33:34,079 --> 01:33:38,249
- I'm gonna call the police now.
- Could I make one phone call first?

1093
01:33:38,500 --> 01:33:40,084
Get out of here!

1094
01:33:51,096 --> 01:33:53,181
Elaine Robinson has left school.

1095
01:33:54,183 --> 01:33:57,185
Her roommate's coming down
with a note for you.

1096
01:34:00,564 --> 01:34:03,024
Dear Benjamin,
please forgive me,

1097
01:34:03,108 --> 01:34:06,319
because I know what I'm doing
is the best thing for you.

1098
01:34:06,403 --> 01:34:09,238
My father is so upset.
You've got to understand.

1099
01:34:09,323 --> 01:34:11,199
I love you, but it would never work out.

1100
01:35:35,950 --> 01:35:37,158
Elaine?

1101
01:35:39,412 --> 01:35:40,912
Hello, Benjamin.

1102
01:35:45,668 --> 01:35:47,961
- Where is she?
- Hello. Get me the police, please.

1103
01:35:48,004 --> 01:35:50,422
- Where's Elaine?
- I'll be with you in a moment, Benjamin.

1104
01:35:50,464 --> 01:35:54,134
Do you have a patrol car
in the vicinity of 1200 Glenview Road?

1105
01:35:54,969 --> 01:35:56,845
Good. We have a burglar here.

1106
01:35:57,138 --> 01:35:59,806
Just a second. I'll ask him. Are you armed?

1107
01:36:01,475 --> 01:36:04,144
No, I don't believe he is. Thank you.

1108
01:36:05,146 --> 01:36:06,396
What have you done to her?

1109
01:36:06,480 --> 01:36:09,107
I think we have everything
quite under control now, Benjamin.

1110
01:36:09,150 --> 01:36:10,901
Would you like
a quick drink before you go?

1111
01:36:10,985 --> 01:36:14,279
You can't stop me from seeing her,
Mrs. Robinson. I'll find her.

1112
01:36:14,447 --> 01:36:16,865
Sorry we won't be able
to invite you to the wedding, Benjamin,

1113
01:36:16,949 --> 01:36:19,159
but the arrangements
have been so rushed.

1114
01:36:20,494 --> 01:36:22,245
What the hell have you...

1115
01:36:27,335 --> 01:36:30,837
I don't think you'll have time
for that drink after all.

1116
01:36:31,839 --> 01:36:34,674
- I'll find her.
- I don't think so.

1117
01:37:38,823 --> 01:37:44,035
Say, fellas. Do any of you fellas know
where Carl Smith is?

1118
01:37:44,078 --> 01:37:46,663
He took off in the middle of the night
to get married.

1119
01:37:46,747 --> 01:37:49,749
Yeah, probably one step
ahead of the shotgun.

1120
01:37:49,834 --> 01:37:52,043
Would you happen to know
where he's getting married?

1121
01:37:52,086 --> 01:37:55,213
- I'm supposed to be there.
- Why don't you ask Carter?

1122
01:37:55,715 --> 01:37:57,841
Would you happen to know
where I might find him?

1123
01:37:57,925 --> 01:38:02,762
Hey, Carter! Hey, where's
the make-out king getting married?

1124
01:38:03,055 --> 01:38:04,347
Santa Barbara!

1125
01:38:04,640 --> 01:38:06,599
You don't happen to know exactly where

1126
01:38:06,642 --> 01:38:08,810
the old make-out king
is getting married, do you?

1127
01:38:08,894 --> 01:38:10,228
I'm supposed to be there.

1128
01:38:10,271 --> 01:38:12,313
Where in Santa Barbara?

1129
01:38:13,232 --> 01:38:17,944
I don't know. Maybe his old man's house
or in the maternity ward.

1130
01:38:19,113 --> 01:38:21,197
- Hey, you going to the wedding?
Yeah.

1131
01:38:21,282 --> 01:38:23,616
Hey, tell him to save a piece for me.

1132
01:38:25,286 --> 01:38:26,870
Of the wedding cake.

1133
01:39:12,749 --> 01:39:15,125
- Can I use your phone?
- Yeah.

1134
01:39:41,361 --> 01:39:42,986
657-2036.

1135
01:39:43,029 --> 01:39:46,031
- Hello, who is this?
- This is Dr. Smith's answering service.

1136
01:39:46,116 --> 01:39:47,449
Is the doctor anywhere?

1137
01:39:47,534 --> 01:39:50,202
Well, I'm afraid the doctor can't
be reached right now. If you'd like...

1138
01:39:50,245 --> 01:39:51,745
I have to know where he is.

1139
01:39:51,830 --> 01:39:55,707
Well, you see, the doctor is at his son's
wedding, but I'm sure it's over by now.

1140
01:39:55,750 --> 01:39:57,876
- He should be checking in any moment.
- Listen to me.

1141
01:39:57,961 --> 01:40:00,754
I'm Dr. Smith's brother, Reverend Smith,

1142
01:40:00,839 --> 01:40:02,756
and I'm supposed
to perform the ceremony.

1143
01:40:02,841 --> 01:40:05,926
I just got in from Portland,
and I've forgotten what church, you see.

1144
01:40:06,010 --> 01:40:09,972
Oh. Well, I'm not sure,
but you might try the First Presbyterian.

1145
01:40:10,056 --> 01:40:12,099
- Now that's on Allan Street.
- Thank you.

1146
01:40:13,393 --> 01:40:15,060
Allan Street, where is it?

1147
01:40:15,854 --> 01:40:18,522
Allan. It's, it's...

1148
01:40:19,899 --> 01:40:23,402
It's six blocks up and, uh, three over.

1149
01:40:24,821 --> 01:40:26,488
You need any gas, Father?

1150
01:42:14,514 --> 01:42:16,515
Oh, Jesus God.

1151
01:42:16,557 --> 01:42:17,683
No.

1152
01:42:28,528 --> 01:42:38,744
Elaine! Elaine!

1153
01:42:39,079 --> 01:42:41,205
Who is that guy? What's he doing?
- Elaine!

1154
01:42:41,290 --> 01:42:43,958
- I'll take care of him.
- He's too late.

1155
01:42:45,043 --> 01:42:54,218
Elaine! Elaine!

1156
01:42:54,261 --> 01:42:56,887
Get up,
you have to stop him.

1157
01:42:57,556 --> 01:43:01,892
Elaine! Elaine! Elaine!

1158
01:43:02,060 --> 01:43:06,188
Elaine! Elaine!

1159
01:43:09,526 --> 01:43:13,237
Elaine! Elaine! Elaine!

1160
01:43:13,280 --> 01:43:18,242
- Elaine!
- Ben!

1161
01:43:21,705 --> 01:43:24,081
You punk. You crazy punk!

1162
01:43:25,083 --> 01:43:26,417
I'll kill you.

1163
01:43:40,474 --> 01:43:41,932
Elaine! It's too late!

1164
01:43:42,017 --> 01:43:43,726
Not for me!

1165
01:43:45,187 --> 01:43:48,272
Move! Move!

1166
01:43:48,315 --> 01:43:49,648
- Damn you!
- Move!
