1
00:00:06,807 --> 00:00:07,037
.

2
00:00:07,041 --> 00:00:08,941
<i> - Previously on "Suits"...</i>

3
00:00:08,943 --> 00:00:10,083
- You think that I don't know
that all your problems

4
00:00:10,077 --> 00:00:11,537
are solved if I tell them
that Harvey did this?

5
00:00:11,545 --> 00:00:13,505
- I would be lying if I said
it didn't cross my mind

6
00:00:13,514 --> 00:00:15,954
that maybe Mike should think
about making a deal.

7
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:17,950
And now that they've taken in
your father, you can't tell me

8
00:00:17,952 --> 00:00:19,922
that the thought
hasn't crossed yours too.

9
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,190
- Thinking about it and talking
about it aren't the same thing.

10
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:25,359
- I got a call about an article
on Mike Ross' meteoric rise

11
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:26,829
to Junior Partner.

12
00:00:26,827 --> 00:00:29,127
The problem is
there is no Mike Ross.

13
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:30,700
- You reported it
anonymously,

14
00:00:30,698 --> 00:00:32,128
because you didn't want
to look bad.

15
00:00:32,133 --> 00:00:33,903
- I reported it anonymously

16
00:00:33,901 --> 00:00:36,141
because I was ashamed
that it happened on my watch.

17
00:00:36,137 --> 00:00:38,267
- I loved you, and you let
some stupid secret

18
00:00:38,272 --> 00:00:40,412
come between us because
you couldn't trust me with it.

19
00:00:40,408 --> 00:00:42,908
- All you have to do
is admit what you did,

20
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:44,440
and all of this goes away.

21
00:00:44,445 --> 00:00:46,145
- Sheila came forward.

22
00:00:46,147 --> 00:00:48,247
She admitted she was the one
who wrote the e-mail.

23
00:00:48,249 --> 00:00:50,779
- You and your partners
are hereby subpoenaed

24
00:00:50,785 --> 00:00:54,285
to hand over every single
document in the entire firm.

25
00:00:57,525 --> 00:00:59,425
- Harvey, I'm not sure
this is the best idea.

26
00:00:59,427 --> 00:01:02,087
- We need to know what she has.
What's the downside?

27
00:01:02,096 --> 00:01:04,026
- The downside is
that we move up the trial.

28
00:01:04,031 --> 00:01:06,931
- Mike, this trial's coming,
whether we like it or not.

29
00:01:06,934 --> 00:01:09,174
And the more time we have
knowing her game plan,

30
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:12,740
the better off we'll be.

31
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:14,810
- Holy shit.
- What?

32
00:01:14,809 --> 00:01:16,679
- I took the LSATs
with this guy.

33
00:01:16,677 --> 00:01:18,137
- So what?

34
00:01:18,145 --> 00:01:20,645
- So he can give Gibbs something
she doesn't even have on me yet.

35
00:01:20,648 --> 00:01:23,078
- Yes, but to do that, he'd
be ruining his whole career.

36
00:01:23,084 --> 00:01:24,924
Which means, even
if he remembers you,

37
00:01:24,919 --> 00:01:26,589
he's more afraid of you
than you are of him.

38
00:01:26,587 --> 00:01:28,947
So calm the hell down.

39
00:01:28,956 --> 00:01:30,916
- All right, let's make
this quick.

40
00:01:30,925 --> 00:01:32,515
- Your Honor,
making it quick is exactly

41
00:01:32,526 --> 00:01:34,156
what we're asking you to do.

42
00:01:34,161 --> 00:01:35,991
She hasn't handed over
her discovery yet.

43
00:01:35,996 --> 00:01:37,626
- I'm still building a case,

44
00:01:37,631 --> 00:01:39,471
and we haven't even set
a date for the trial yet.

45
00:01:39,467 --> 00:01:41,527
- And the check's in the mail,
and all the other things

46
00:01:41,535 --> 00:01:44,065
people say when they don't wanna
do what they have to do.

47
00:01:44,071 --> 00:01:45,601
- What I have to do
is protect the public

48
00:01:45,606 --> 00:01:47,536
from the likes of you.
- All right, that's enough.

49
00:01:47,541 --> 00:01:49,371
Get that discovery to them
by the end of the day.

50
00:01:49,376 --> 00:01:51,506
- In that case, we'd like to ask
that the day of the trial

51
00:01:51,512 --> 00:01:53,082
be set in the next two weeks.

52
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,310
- Objection, Your Honor,
she's had weeks to--

53
00:01:55,316 --> 00:01:57,176
- You can't have it both ways,
Mr. Specter.

54
00:01:57,184 --> 00:01:59,924
You can't demand discovery
and ask for more time.

55
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,590
Trial starts in two weeks.

56
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:06,829
- Jessica, we have
a problem.

57
00:02:06,827 --> 00:02:08,227
- Thanks for pointing
that out, Jack.

58
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:09,559
I had no idea.

59
00:02:09,563 --> 00:02:11,003
- I'm not talking
about the trial.

60
00:02:10,998 --> 00:02:12,398
I'm talking about this.

61
00:02:12,399 --> 00:02:13,499
- What the hell is that?

62
00:02:13,501 --> 00:02:15,801
- An Op-Ed in the Journal.

63
00:02:15,803 --> 00:02:18,243
"There is no way
on God's green Earth

64
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,909
"that at least one
of the three name partners

65
00:02:20,908 --> 00:02:23,078
"at Pearson Specter Litt

66
00:02:23,077 --> 00:02:26,977
didn't know what was going on
under their own roof."

67
00:02:26,981 --> 00:02:30,181
- "God's green Earth."
Who wrote it?

68
00:02:30,184 --> 00:02:31,524
- A partner at Skaaden.

69
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:33,019
If it wasn't them,
it would've been someone else,

70
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:35,250
because they smell blood.
- I don't care what they smell.

71
00:02:35,256 --> 00:02:37,056
I've given up everything
for this firm,

72
00:02:37,057 --> 00:02:38,817
and if anybody tries
to take it from me,

73
00:02:38,826 --> 00:02:41,886
they'll have to pry it
from my cold, dead hands.

74
00:02:41,896 --> 00:02:44,096
- And what's your goddamn plan?
- Excuse me?

75
00:02:44,098 --> 00:02:46,098
- Jessica, our reputation's
taking a beating.

76
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:47,270
We need to rehabilitate it.

77
00:02:47,268 --> 00:02:49,298
That means pro bono,
and you know it.

78
00:02:49,303 --> 00:02:51,673
- One free case is not going
to move the needle,

79
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:52,912
no matter how worthy it is.

80
00:02:52,907 --> 00:02:54,237
- I'm not talking
about one case.

81
00:02:54,241 --> 00:02:55,941
I'm talking about
a series of cases

82
00:02:55,943 --> 00:02:58,843
for our clients'
most valued charities.

83
00:03:00,481 --> 00:03:02,981
- Oh, this better not be
another scheme, Jack.

84
00:03:02,983 --> 00:03:04,323
- You think this is a move?

85
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:06,318
- Now why would I ever
think that after you tried

86
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:09,760
to take my firm from me six
times in the last ten minutes?

87
00:03:09,757 --> 00:03:11,387
- I did try
to take over from you.

88
00:03:11,392 --> 00:03:14,162
But I've been at this firm
my entire career,

89
00:03:14,161 --> 00:03:15,731
and I am fighting for it now.

90
00:03:15,729 --> 00:03:17,529
- And you think I'm not?
- I'm sure you are.

91
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:19,701
But you're also the reason
I'm holding this indictment

92
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:20,900
of our firm
in the first place,

93
00:03:20,901 --> 00:03:22,671
because what they're
saying is true.

94
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:24,170
And don't you dare
try to tell me

95
00:03:24,171 --> 00:03:25,401
you didn't know
about Mike Ross,

96
00:03:25,406 --> 00:03:27,306
because we both know you did.

97
00:03:36,517 --> 00:03:38,117
- What the hell do you want?

98
00:03:38,118 --> 00:03:40,018
- Oh, since you made me come
all the way down here,

99
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:42,450
I thought I'd save the taxpayers
some money on hiring a server.

100
00:03:42,456 --> 00:03:43,816
- A server for what?

101
00:03:43,824 --> 00:03:45,964
- For your fiancée. I'd like
to ask her some questions.

102
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,260
- Get the hell out of here.

103
00:03:47,261 --> 00:03:49,331
You want to serve a subpoena,
you serve it to her.

104
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:51,460
- Well, then I wouldn't get
to see the look on your face.

105
00:03:51,465 --> 00:03:53,595
Did you really think I wouldn't
hit you where it hurts?

106
00:03:53,601 --> 00:03:56,371
I was saving
your weakest spot for last.

107
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:57,900
Have a nice day, gentlemen.

108
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:05,079
- What?
- You know what.

109
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:07,249
It's time we give that woman
a taste of her own medicine.

110
00:04:07,248 --> 00:04:08,808
- What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

111
00:04:08,816 --> 00:04:10,746
- It means we hire a lawyer
from an outside firm,

112
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:12,681
and we dig up dirt on someone
she cares about.

113
00:04:12,686 --> 00:04:14,846
- Are you out of your mind?
- You saw what she did to Donna.

114
00:04:14,855 --> 00:04:16,785
It's only a matter of time
before she tries to pull

115
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:18,290
the same shit with Rachel.
- Mike--

116
00:04:18,292 --> 00:04:19,962
- Harvey, you're the one
that taught me that when someone

117
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,730
puts pressure on you,
you put it back on them.

118
00:04:21,729 --> 00:04:23,559
- I also taught you if you're
gonna take a swing at someone,

119
00:04:23,564 --> 00:04:25,804
you better knock them out,
and if we pull the shit

120
00:04:25,799 --> 00:04:27,469
that you're talking about
and get caught,

121
00:04:27,468 --> 00:04:30,238
all that happens is
I get thrown off this case,

122
00:04:30,237 --> 00:04:32,237
and it's game over.

123
00:04:32,239 --> 00:04:34,139
- Harvey, I can't stand by
and watch while the people

124
00:04:34,141 --> 00:04:36,211
I care about get attacked,
and neither could you.

125
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:37,540
- Mike, I promise you,

126
00:04:37,544 --> 00:04:39,444
I will be there for Rachel
every step of the way.

127
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:40,806
In the meantime,

128
00:04:40,814 --> 00:04:43,384
I need you going through
every one of those boxes.

129
00:04:43,384 --> 00:04:45,284
Because if that woman
is ready to go to trial,

130
00:04:45,286 --> 00:04:47,046
she's got a lot more
than an e-mail

131
00:04:47,054 --> 00:04:49,624

142
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:24,416
- Rachel Zane.
- Yes?

143
00:05:24,425 --> 00:05:26,015
My name is Anita Gibbs.
I'm the--

144
00:05:26,026 --> 00:05:27,226
- Yes, I know who you are.

145
00:05:27,227 --> 00:05:29,557
I'm flattered you came
for me personally.

146
00:05:29,563 --> 00:05:31,703
But we aren't supposed to talk
for another three days,

147
00:05:31,699 --> 00:05:33,229
and I don't have my lawyer
with me, so--

148
00:05:33,233 --> 00:05:35,003
- This isn't
a formal interrogation.

149
00:05:35,002 --> 00:05:36,232
That won't be necessary.

150
00:05:36,236 --> 00:05:38,566
- Then I'll tell you
what is necessary.

151
00:05:38,572 --> 00:05:40,372
You're going to put in writing
that anything I say to you

152
00:05:40,374 --> 00:05:41,574
is inadmissible.

153
00:05:41,575 --> 00:05:43,205
- I suspected you'd
say that, which is why

154
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:47,650
I prepared this.

155
00:05:47,648 --> 00:05:50,648
I understand if you'd prefer
to ask somebody who's actually

156
00:05:50,651 --> 00:05:54,591
completed law school
if that's legally binding.

157
00:05:54,588 --> 00:05:56,358
- I'm perfectly capable
of determining

158
00:05:56,357 --> 00:05:58,887
if this is legally
binding or not.

159
00:05:58,892 --> 00:06:00,292
and I'm not going to let you

160
00:06:00,294 --> 00:06:02,664
bait me into saying
anything to you.

161
00:06:02,663 --> 00:06:03,733
- Well, that's fine with me.

162
00:06:03,731 --> 00:06:05,901
I'm not looking for you to talk.

163
00:06:05,899 --> 00:06:07,699
I'm looking for you to listen.

164
00:06:15,576 --> 00:06:16,576
- Well, it's official.

165
00:06:16,577 --> 00:06:17,807
No matter what
happens at trial,

166
00:06:17,811 --> 00:06:19,581
this firm isn't surviving
Mike Ross.

167
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,250
- I know about
the editorial, Louis.

168
00:06:21,248 --> 00:06:22,578
- What editorial?

169
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:25,723
I'm talking about the summer
associate applications.

170
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:26,949
- How bad is it?
- Three people.

171
00:06:26,954 --> 00:06:29,094
Not just any three people,
the three people that never

172
00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:30,989
should've made it to Harvard
in the first place.

173
00:06:30,991 --> 00:06:32,421
- Goddamn it.

174
00:06:32,426 --> 00:06:34,486
Sheila's sending us
the bottom of the barrel.

175
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:36,255
- She's giving us
the sludge that grows

176
00:06:36,263 --> 00:06:40,403
at the bottom of the barrel.
- Then...

177
00:06:40,401 --> 00:06:44,941
I think it might be time to
start looking beyond Harvard.

178
00:06:44,938 --> 00:06:46,808
- Yeah, that's a great idea.
You know what?

179
00:06:46,807 --> 00:06:47,767
We should start shitting
in the urinals

180
00:06:47,775 --> 00:06:48,765
while we're at it.

181
00:06:48,776 --> 00:06:49,876
- I'm not talking about

182
00:06:49,877 --> 00:06:51,777
the University
of Arizona, Louis.

183
00:06:51,779 --> 00:06:54,779
I'm talking about Columbia,
Yale, Stanford--

184
00:06:54,782 --> 00:06:57,282
- And I'm talking
about appearances.

185
00:06:57,284 --> 00:06:59,754
We break our rule and suddenly
hire outside of Harvard--

186
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:02,323
- We already broke our rule
for Rachel with Columbia.

187
00:07:02,322 --> 00:07:04,122
- Please, that was different,
and you know it.

188
00:07:04,124 --> 00:07:05,924
- No. It was because of Mike,

189
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:08,186
which makes it the same
goddamn thing.

190
00:07:08,195 --> 00:07:11,125
One way or another, we are
going to keep this firm going.

191
00:07:11,131 --> 00:07:13,501
So if you don't wanna go
outside of Harvard to do that,

192
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,330
then I suggest you go up
to Cambridge,

193
00:07:16,336 --> 00:07:17,996
and convince Sheila
to start feeding us

194
00:07:18,005 --> 00:07:20,165
some worthy
goddamn applicants.

197
00:07:25,746 --> 00:07:27,876
- Okay. So first
you pick me up,

198
00:07:27,881 --> 00:07:30,181
then you bring me
to my favorite café.

199
00:07:30,184 --> 00:07:31,754
- What can I say?
I do my homework.

200
00:07:31,752 --> 00:07:33,592
- As do I, Ms. Gibbs,
which is why I'm not falling

201
00:07:33,587 --> 00:07:34,987
for you pretending
to be my friend.

202
00:07:34,988 --> 00:07:36,418
- You're right.
I'm not your friend.

203
00:07:36,423 --> 00:07:37,863
But I am willing
to pull some strings

204
00:07:37,858 --> 00:07:39,958
to get the man you love
into Columbia Law School.

205
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,190
- And if you think that I'm
gonna buy that fairy tale,

206
00:07:42,196 --> 00:07:44,096
the only strings you're trying
to pull are mine.

207
00:07:44,097 --> 00:07:46,197
- The only fairy tale here
is the one where you believe

208
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,400
you get out
of this thing unscathed.

209
00:07:48,402 --> 00:07:50,242
- Okay.
We're done here.

210
00:07:50,237 --> 00:07:51,837
- Rachel, I'm just trying
to give you your options.

211
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:52,939
- I know my options.

212
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:54,740
- Then you know you have
no spousal privilege,

213
00:07:54,741 --> 00:07:56,171
which means you're going to
have to tell the truth,

214
00:07:56,176 --> 00:07:57,636
and put your fiancée away.

215
00:07:57,644 --> 00:07:59,644
Or you're gonna have
to plead the Fifth.

216
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:01,906
- Or I can say that
he didn't do this.

217
00:08:01,915 --> 00:08:04,145
- Perjuring yourself is
the same as taking the Fifth,

218
00:08:04,151 --> 00:08:05,581
as far as your future
is concerned.

219
00:08:05,586 --> 00:08:06,846
- What the hell
does that mean?

220
00:08:06,854 --> 00:08:08,654
- I'm saying that someday
you're going to face

221
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:10,555
the character and fitness
committee of the Bar,

222
00:08:10,557 --> 00:08:12,257
and I seriously doubt they're
going to admit somebody

223
00:08:12,259 --> 00:08:13,389
who did that.

224
00:08:13,393 --> 00:08:14,633
- Are you trying to
intimidate a witness?

225
00:08:14,628 --> 00:08:18,358
Because yes, someday
I will face that committee,

226
00:08:18,365 --> 00:08:20,695
but tomorrow they're going
to be hearing about you.

227
00:08:20,701 --> 00:08:23,301
- I'm your only way
out of this mess.

228
00:08:23,303 --> 00:08:26,573
Just give me the people who are
actually responsible for it,

229
00:08:26,573 --> 00:08:29,613
and I'll see to it that both
you and Mike can practice law

230
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:31,140
for the rest of your lives.

231
00:08:38,952 --> 00:08:40,392
- Please tell me
that's the last one.

232
00:08:40,387 --> 00:08:41,787
- It is.

233
00:08:41,788 --> 00:08:44,018
Except for the hundred
in the other conference room.

234
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:45,724
- Holy shit.
- Yeah.

235
00:08:45,726 --> 00:08:47,556
Trial Strategy 101.

236
00:08:47,561 --> 00:08:49,131
Bury the other side
in paperwork,

237
00:08:49,129 --> 00:08:50,959
so they can't find
what they're looking for.

238
00:08:50,964 --> 00:08:52,234
- And what are we looking for?

239
00:08:52,232 --> 00:08:54,072
- Gibbs' trial strategy.

240
00:08:54,067 --> 00:08:56,797
Somewhere in these boxes
are the pieces

241
00:08:56,803 --> 00:08:58,803
that she is putting together
to make her case.

242
00:08:58,805 --> 00:09:00,235
We find them,
we know specifically

243
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,610
what we have to fight.

244
00:09:01,608 --> 00:09:05,338
- And what specifically might
those things look like?

245
00:09:05,345 --> 00:09:09,105
- Witness lists, interviews,
anything to do with Lola Jensen,

246
00:09:09,116 --> 00:09:11,316
utility bills from when I was
supposed to be at Harvard--

247
00:09:11,318 --> 00:09:13,118
- Wait, wait, wait.
Slow down.

248
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,520
- Why are you writing this down?
- So I can remember it.

249
00:09:15,522 --> 00:09:17,792
And because we need a system.

250
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:20,331
- And because you've never done
doc review before.

251
00:09:21,461 --> 00:09:22,591
I don't believe it.

252
00:09:22,596 --> 00:09:24,126
How you've been a legal
secretary this long,

253
00:09:24,131 --> 00:09:26,231
and never have done doc review.
- I will tell you how.

254
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:28,433
Because I'm the best damn person
you've ever seen

255
00:09:28,435 --> 00:09:30,335
at reading people,
anticipating needs,

256
00:09:30,337 --> 00:09:31,897
and generally
dominating everything.

257
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:33,035
- So, in this situation,

258
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,810
you're going to be
absolutely no help at all.

259
00:09:34,808 --> 00:09:36,638
- None whatsoever.
- I'm getting Rachel.

260
00:09:41,181 --> 00:09:42,681
- What's that?

261
00:09:42,683 --> 00:09:43,883
- What does it look like?

262
00:09:43,884 --> 00:09:45,724
- It looks like something
I don't have time for.

263
00:09:45,719 --> 00:09:47,119
- Well, make time.

264
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,850
- Jessica, we've got a thousand
boxes of shit to go through,

265
00:09:49,856 --> 00:09:52,056
and I've got trial in two weeks.
- What?

266
00:09:52,059 --> 00:09:53,759
- That's right.
The date's been set.

267
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,430
So I'm sorry that I can't have
a doughnut with you right now,

268
00:09:55,429 --> 00:09:57,199
but I've got something a little
more important to deal with.

269
00:09:57,197 --> 00:09:59,657
- Harvey, I understand, but
our clients are being circled.

270
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:00,826
Our reputation's getting
tanked,

271
00:10:00,834 --> 00:10:02,734
and we're getting sent
shit associates.

272
00:10:02,736 --> 00:10:04,136
- And Mike Ross
is facing prison.

273
00:10:04,137 --> 00:10:06,197
- And you're handling
one thing,

274
00:10:06,206 --> 00:10:08,406
while I'm handling
everything else.

275
00:10:08,408 --> 00:10:10,138
- Jessica--
- No, never mind, Harvey.

276
00:10:10,143 --> 00:10:12,983
It's clear that you
really don't care

277
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,450
about keeping
this firm together.

278
00:10:14,448 --> 00:10:16,078
- I resigned to keep
this firm together.

279
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:17,783
- Well, it sure doesn't seem
to be working out that way,

280
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:19,424
does it?

281
00:10:23,423 --> 00:10:27,133
- Great, I'll have my secretary
set up a meeting for Monday.

282
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:29,257
- If that meeting's about your
pro bono bullshit,

283
00:10:29,262 --> 00:10:30,562
cancel it.
- What?

284
00:10:30,564 --> 00:10:33,904
- You said it yourself, Jack.
Other firms smell blood.

285
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:36,940
Well, you don't get a shark
to back off by playing nice,

286
00:10:36,937 --> 00:10:39,367
you do it by clubbing him
in the face.

287
00:10:39,373 --> 00:10:41,613
- They come after our clients,
we go after theirs.

288
00:10:41,608 --> 00:10:43,478
- Clients aren't the ones
writing editorials

289
00:10:43,477 --> 00:10:46,137
for "The Wall Street
Journal", Jack.

290
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:47,676
- You want to poach
an attorney.

291
00:10:47,681 --> 00:10:50,621
- I wanna poach
a whole goddamn department.

292
00:10:50,617 --> 00:10:52,317
- That is definitely
another way to go.

293
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:53,889
- It's the only way to go,

294
00:10:53,887 --> 00:10:56,287
because if we didn't do what
we're saying we didn't do,

295
00:10:56,289 --> 00:10:58,159
this is what we do.
- I get it.

296
00:10:58,158 --> 00:11:00,588
You're trying to convince
the world we're innocent.

297
00:11:00,594 --> 00:11:02,894
- Jack, I don't give a shit
if my enemies think

298
00:11:02,896 --> 00:11:04,296
I'm innocent or not.

299
00:11:04,297 --> 00:11:07,627
I give a shit whether they
think they can take me down,

300
00:11:07,634 --> 00:11:08,974
which is why
I'm not going to cower

301
00:11:08,969 --> 00:11:11,369
in some pro bono corner,
trying to convince them

302
00:11:11,371 --> 00:11:12,801
that I'm friendly.

303
00:11:12,806 --> 00:11:15,136
I'm going to kick some ass,

304
00:11:15,142 --> 00:11:18,012
and remind them
that I'm fierce.

305
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:26,521
[door opening and closing]

306
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,650
- There you are. I've been
looking everywhere for you.

307
00:11:28,655 --> 00:11:31,285
Rachel, we need your help.
Where have you been?

308
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:32,461
- With Anita Gibbs.

309
00:11:32,459 --> 00:11:33,959
- What? How did you
let that happen?

310
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,660
- Because she ambushed me
on the street,

311
00:11:35,662 --> 00:11:37,102
with a document that said
our conversation

312
00:11:37,097 --> 00:11:38,427
would be inadmissible.

313
00:11:38,432 --> 00:11:39,762
- And if she did that
is because she didn't want

314
00:11:39,766 --> 00:11:41,366
to talk to you, she wanted
to get in your head.

315
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:43,938
- Mike, I know what
she wanted to do.

316
00:11:43,937 --> 00:11:45,667
- What did she say?

317
00:11:47,941 --> 00:11:51,081
- She said that she could
get you into Columbia,

318
00:11:51,078 --> 00:11:53,708
and that you could be a lawyer
after all this is over.

319
00:11:53,714 --> 00:11:54,884
- Rachel, she's lying--

320
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:56,051
- You think I don't know that?

321
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:57,519
- Well, we've already
been over this.

322
00:11:57,517 --> 00:11:59,347
The only way she is gonna help
us is if we help her

323
00:11:59,352 --> 00:12:00,692
put Harvey and Jessica away.

324
00:12:00,687 --> 00:12:03,087
- Yes, Mike, I know that,
but we didn't go over the part

325
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:05,590
where I don't get into the Bar
because I took the Fifth.

326
00:12:05,592 --> 00:12:06,792
- Oh, goddamn it!

327
00:12:06,793 --> 00:12:08,633
This is exactly why I wanted
Harvey to be there.

328
00:12:08,628 --> 00:12:10,198
She got into your head.
- She didn't got into my head.

329
00:12:10,197 --> 00:12:11,897
She dangled our dream
in front of me,

330
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:14,128
and I know
that we can't have that.

331
00:12:14,134 --> 00:12:15,934
It doesn't mean
I can't handle this.

332
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:20,909
- It doesn't seem
like you're handling it.

333
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:22,307
- I am.
- You're crying.

334
00:12:22,309 --> 00:12:24,979
- No. I'm releasing my emotions
so that I can persevere

335
00:12:24,978 --> 00:12:28,378
instead of denying them
and losing my mind.

336
00:12:28,381 --> 00:12:30,051
Which I can't do today,

337
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:31,820
because I have a meeting
with the dean.

338
00:12:31,818 --> 00:12:33,718
Now, I came in here
to be alone

339
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,990
so I can deal with my shit,

340
00:12:34,988 --> 00:12:37,518
so if you don't mind,
I would like to be alone

341
00:12:37,524 --> 00:12:38,894
so I can deal with my shit.

342
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:51,668
.

343
00:12:51,671 --> 00:12:53,611
- Hey, did you find something
in the discovery?

344
00:12:53,607 --> 00:12:54,737
- Yeah, sure as hell did.

345
00:12:54,741 --> 00:12:57,141
I just discovered that Gibbs
picked up Rachel.

346
00:12:57,144 --> 00:12:58,344
- What?
She arrested her?

347
00:12:58,345 --> 00:13:00,275
- No, she pulled up to the curb
with some document.

348
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,980
- I don't give a shit what she
pulled up with.

349
00:13:01,982 --> 00:13:03,252
Rachel should know
not to go with her.

350
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:04,750
- Yeah, and that would've been
an excellent thing

351
00:13:04,751 --> 00:13:07,051
for her lawyer to tell her,
except her lawyer wasn't there.

352
00:13:07,053 --> 00:13:08,323
- Excuse me?
- You promised me

353
00:13:08,321 --> 00:13:10,161
that you would be with her
every step of the way.

354
00:13:10,157 --> 00:13:12,187
- I promised I'd represent her
at a deposition,

355
00:13:12,192 --> 00:13:13,892
not babysit her
24 hours a day.

356
00:13:13,894 --> 00:13:16,334
- Maybe instead of getting mad
at Rachel, it is time for us

357
00:13:16,329 --> 00:13:18,099
to figure out
how to go after Gibbs.

358
00:13:18,098 --> 00:13:19,658
- This again.
- Yes, this again.

359
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:21,996
I told you she was gonna go
after Rachel, and now she has.

360
00:13:22,002 --> 00:13:23,902
- And I told you if you're
gonna go after someone,

361
00:13:23,904 --> 00:13:25,204
you better knock them out.

362
00:13:25,205 --> 00:13:27,405
- Then you better figure out
a way to knock Gibbs out soon,

363
00:13:27,407 --> 00:13:29,837
because if you don't, I will.

364
00:13:38,819 --> 00:13:42,189
- Louis.

365
00:13:42,189 --> 00:13:44,119
What are you doing here?
- What?

366
00:13:44,124 --> 00:13:45,794
You thought you could lie to
my face and get away with it?

367
00:13:45,792 --> 00:13:47,132
- I never lied to you.
- Really?

368
00:13:47,127 --> 00:13:48,487
Because you swore
you wouldn't come forward

369
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:49,955
about that e-mail,
but you did.

370
00:13:49,963 --> 00:13:51,833
And you you're pulling
this associate shit.

371
00:13:51,832 --> 00:13:53,532
- I didn't come forward.
They found me.

372
00:13:53,533 --> 00:13:55,173
And I'm not pulling
any associate shit.

373
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:56,628
- Then what do you call
this pathetic excuse

374
00:13:56,636 --> 00:13:58,396
of a candidates list?
- I call it inevitable.

375
00:13:58,405 --> 00:14:00,565
Because our students can read.

376
00:14:00,574 --> 00:14:01,874
- The editorial.
- Yes.

377
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:03,905
The editorial.

378
00:14:05,111 --> 00:14:06,811
- So you're not
sending us sludge.

379
00:14:06,813 --> 00:14:09,083
- Louis, I'm not
doing anything.

380
00:14:09,082 --> 00:14:13,222
Your firm is being investigated
by the U.S. Attorney's office.

381
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:15,990
And no one is going to risk
their career on a place

382
00:14:15,989 --> 00:14:17,959
that may not even exist
in a month.

383
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:21,188
- They might,
if you convince them to.

384
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:23,834
- Louis, I can't do that.
- Sheila, please.

385
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:25,860
I came here once before,
hoping for a second chance

386
00:14:25,866 --> 00:14:27,066
and you wouldn't
give it to me.

387
00:14:27,067 --> 00:14:28,397
- What does that
have to do with this?

388
00:14:28,401 --> 00:14:29,801
- Because if we'd gotten
back together then,

389
00:14:29,803 --> 00:14:31,203
I wouldn't even be
at the firm now,

390
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:32,944
but I am.

391
00:14:32,939 --> 00:14:35,269
And it's all I have.

392
00:14:35,275 --> 00:14:38,875
I understand you not giving
me a second chance then.

393
00:14:40,313 --> 00:14:43,823
But I'm begging you...

394
00:14:43,817 --> 00:14:45,717
give my firm one now.

395
00:14:45,719 --> 00:14:50,359
- Louis, even if I wanted to,
it won't work.

396
00:14:50,357 --> 00:14:52,417
- You don't know that.
- Yes, I do.

397
00:14:52,425 --> 00:14:54,785
Because they're going to ask me
if I think it's a good idea

398
00:14:54,794 --> 00:14:58,064
for them to work at Pearson
Specter Litt, and I don't.

399
00:14:58,064 --> 00:15:01,234
- Sheila--
- Louis.

400
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:03,534
Please don't ask me
to lie to them.

401
00:15:10,477 --> 00:15:11,907
- What are you doing?

402
00:15:11,912 --> 00:15:13,582
- I'm just wondering
if you're gonna stay in here

403
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:14,810
going over stuff all day.

404
00:15:14,814 --> 00:15:16,714
- What else would I be doing?
Going to the ball game?

405
00:15:16,716 --> 00:15:18,276
- I don't know, Harvey,

406
00:15:18,285 --> 00:15:19,915
I thought maybe you'd be doing
something to get Anita Gibbs

407
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,020
to back off Rachel.

408
00:15:21,021 --> 00:15:22,791
- Donna, she threatened
to go to the Bar.

409
00:15:22,789 --> 00:15:24,789
It's a bullshit hypothetical
that she couldn't do

410
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:26,191
until after Rachel testified.

411
00:15:26,192 --> 00:15:27,832
Which is after
the trial starts,

412
00:15:27,827 --> 00:15:29,387
and that's what I'm
goddamn working on.

413
00:15:29,396 --> 00:15:31,256
- Harvey, all I'm saying is

414
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:33,634
that when Mike gets worked up
about something,

415
00:15:33,633 --> 00:15:35,333
he doesn't tend to make
the best decisions.

416
00:15:35,335 --> 00:15:36,765
- Well, if he doesn't work
on the discovery,

417
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:39,240
he's gonna go to jail, so...

418
00:15:39,239 --> 00:15:41,409
what do you want me to do?
- I don't know, Harvey.

419
00:15:41,408 --> 00:15:43,368
But you better at least
go talk to Anita Gibbs,

420
00:15:43,376 --> 00:15:45,406
because Mike gave you
a warning loud and clear.

421
00:15:45,412 --> 00:15:48,012
If you don't do something,
he will.

422
00:15:57,891 --> 00:16:00,831
- Jack, I don't often come
outside for my coffee,

423
00:16:00,827 --> 00:16:03,157
but when I do is because
I'm feeling the need

424
00:16:03,163 --> 00:16:04,563
for a little alone time.

425
00:16:04,564 --> 00:16:07,004
- Well, I came out here because
I knew you wouldn't want

426
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,130
anyone hearing
what I have to say.

427
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:12,466
- Are you here to tell me
you can get the job done?

428
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:15,172
- No, I'm here to tell you
if you want me to get it done,

429
00:16:15,175 --> 00:16:17,575
you're going to have
to open your wallet.

430
00:16:17,577 --> 00:16:19,377
- I'm not paying you
more money,

431
00:16:19,379 --> 00:16:20,949
just to get you to
poach a department.

432
00:16:20,947 --> 00:16:22,447
- I'm not talking about me.

433
00:16:22,449 --> 00:16:25,619
I'm talking the real estate
division of Baker Hostetler.

434
00:16:25,618 --> 00:16:27,918
- How much do they want?
- Double what they're making.

435
00:16:27,921 --> 00:16:31,561
- Are you insane? That's what
broke Dewey Ballantine.

436
00:16:31,558 --> 00:16:33,418
You can't have two classes
of partners.

437
00:16:33,426 --> 00:16:34,986
- Then we can't poach
a department,

438
00:16:34,995 --> 00:16:37,195
because they're the only ones
even willing to come here,

439
00:16:37,197 --> 00:16:38,727
considering what's going on.

440
00:16:42,202 --> 00:16:44,372
- Then make the offer.

441
00:16:44,371 --> 00:16:47,741
And let me have
my goddamn coffee in peace.

442
00:16:55,115 --> 00:16:56,245
- Ms. Scott,

443
00:16:56,249 --> 00:16:57,849
there's a Harvey Specter
here to see you.

444
00:16:57,851 --> 00:16:59,981
He says it's urgent.

445
00:16:59,986 --> 00:17:01,186
- Send him in.

446
00:17:02,489 --> 00:17:04,489
I don't believe it.

447
00:17:04,491 --> 00:17:07,161
You have some balls pretending
to be Harvey to get in here.

448
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,930
- Well, you did call me
"Baby Harvey" once.

449
00:17:08,928 --> 00:17:10,458
- I don't give a shit
what I called you.

450
00:17:10,463 --> 00:17:12,133
Get out! Now!
- Scottie, Scottie, please.

451
00:17:12,132 --> 00:17:14,102
Listen, I knew you would
never agree to see me,

452
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,130
and I need to talk to you.

453
00:17:15,135 --> 00:17:17,295
- About what?

454
00:17:17,303 --> 00:17:18,743
- I need someone
to bring an action

455
00:17:18,738 --> 00:17:20,838
against Anita Gibbs' sister.
- Are you insane?

456
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,740
- Listen to me.
She's not just coming after me.

457
00:17:22,742 --> 00:17:25,542
She's coming after my fiancée.
- I don't care.

458
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:27,475
If I do that, I might as well
call the woman up,

459
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,480
and tell her that I'm in
on your whole bullshit too.

460
00:17:29,482 --> 00:17:30,782
- We get someone
from your firm--

461
00:17:30,784 --> 00:17:32,384
- Not to mention I told Harvey
that I never

462
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:34,915
even wanted to hear
your name again.

463
00:17:34,921 --> 00:17:36,121
- [sighs]

464
00:17:36,122 --> 00:17:37,962
- He didn't tell you
about that, did he?

465
00:17:37,957 --> 00:17:39,217
[scoffs]

466
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:40,685
Well, I guess
he hasn't changed,

467
00:17:40,693 --> 00:17:42,093
because he didn't
tell me about you

468
00:17:42,095 --> 00:17:43,795
until it was too late either.

469
00:17:43,797 --> 00:17:46,527
So I am sorry
about your fiancée,

470
00:17:46,533 --> 00:17:48,133
but I need you to go now.

471
00:17:48,134 --> 00:17:49,704
- Scottie, this woman
is not gonna stop

472
00:17:49,702 --> 00:17:51,272
until she gets
what she wants.

473
00:17:51,271 --> 00:17:53,401
And what she wants
is Harvey.

474
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:56,106
So I'm not asking you to do
this for me and Rachel.

475
00:17:56,109 --> 00:17:57,779
I'm asking you
to do it for him.

476
00:18:10,223 --> 00:18:11,963
- Is that an invitation
to your<i> bar mitzvah?</i>

477
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:13,258
because I'm busy that day.

478
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:14,759
- It's a motion
to have you sanctioned

479
00:18:14,761 --> 00:18:16,431
for improperly
contacting a witness.

480
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:18,129
- I didn't improperly
contact anyone.

481
00:18:18,131 --> 00:18:19,461
- Oh, bullshit.

482
00:18:19,466 --> 00:18:20,926
You got Rachel Zane alone
so you could offer her

483
00:18:20,934 --> 00:18:22,174
a deal to turn on me.

484
00:18:22,168 --> 00:18:23,698
- And there's nothing wrong
with that.

485
00:18:23,703 --> 00:18:24,743
- You listen to me.

486
00:18:24,737 --> 00:18:26,137
You've been pulling shit
like this

487
00:18:26,139 --> 00:18:27,909
from the second
this thing started.

488
00:18:27,907 --> 00:18:29,937
You denied my client access
to his attorney,

489
00:18:29,943 --> 00:18:31,783
you fabricated charges
against Donna,

490
00:18:31,778 --> 00:18:33,378
and now you're tampering
with a witness.

491
00:18:33,379 --> 00:18:35,809
- And all witness tampering
would do is hurt my own case,

492
00:18:35,815 --> 00:18:37,715
and why on God's green Earth
would I do that?

493
00:18:37,717 --> 00:18:38,717
<i> [dramatic music]</i>

494
00:18:38,718 --> 00:18:40,218
- Why did you just say?

495
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:42,190
- I said you're insane
if you think that--

496
00:18:42,188 --> 00:18:43,718
- No, you said,
"on God's green Earth,"

497
00:18:43,723 --> 00:18:45,993
which is exactly
what that editorial said.

498
00:18:45,992 --> 00:18:47,292
I remember because I thought,

499
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:49,733
"What person under 80
uses that phrase?"

500
00:18:49,729 --> 00:18:51,729
Well, looks like I found her.

501
00:18:51,731 --> 00:18:53,331
- I don't know
what you're talking about.

502
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:55,903
- You sure as hell do, because
you planted that goddamn thing.

503
00:18:55,902 --> 00:18:59,072
- You have any proof?
No, you don't.

504
00:18:59,072 --> 00:19:02,012
But even if I did plant that,
it would only have been

that one of you

what was going on.

And until one of you
admits that,

508

I'm going to take apart your
firm brick by brick.

You go ahead.

Have a seat.
- Thank you, Dean.

515
00:19:26,866 --> 00:19:29,996
I have to say I've
so been looking forward

516
00:19:30,003 --> 00:19:32,273
to my first student review.

517
00:19:32,272 --> 00:19:33,972
- And ever since
your first interview here,

518
00:19:33,973 --> 00:19:35,913
you've done nothing
but impress me.

519
00:19:35,909 --> 00:19:38,579
Which is why I'm sorry
to have to bring this up now.

520
00:19:38,578 --> 00:19:40,108
- Bring what up?

521
00:19:40,113 --> 00:19:42,783
- The fact that your last LSAT
score was significantly higher

522
00:19:42,782 --> 00:19:44,252
than your previous ones.

523
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:48,650
- That is because I studied
incredibly hard the last time.

524
00:19:48,655 --> 00:19:53,485
- Did you study hard? Or did
your fiancée study hard for you?

525
00:19:53,493 --> 00:19:56,033
- You think Mike took
the LSAT for me?

526
00:19:56,029 --> 00:19:57,199
- I think he's been indicted

527
00:19:57,197 --> 00:19:58,697
for more serious crimes
than that.

528
00:19:58,698 --> 00:19:59,858
And now there are allegations

529
00:19:59,866 --> 00:20:01,326
that he's taken the LSATs
for people.

530
00:20:01,334 --> 00:20:04,804
- I can't believe this.
I took that test myself.

531
00:20:04,804 --> 00:20:07,744
- And I have a responsibility
to protect the reputation

532
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:08,940
of this university.

533
00:20:08,942 --> 00:20:10,542
- And how exactly
are you proposing

534
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:12,183
to protect that reputation?

535
00:20:12,178 --> 00:20:14,178
- By expelling
any dangers to it.

536
00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:17,679
Unless, of course,
for some reason

537
00:20:17,684 --> 00:20:20,324
these allegations against him
are dropped.

538
00:20:21,621 --> 00:20:23,821
- Anita Gibbs called you,
didn't she?

539
00:20:23,823 --> 00:20:25,493
- I have no idea
what you're talking about.

540
00:20:25,491 --> 00:20:26,891
I'm simply giving you
the courtesy

541
00:20:26,893 --> 00:20:28,633

that if I have to choose

542
00:20:28,628 --> 00:20:32,658

and this university's,

543
00:20:32,665 --> 00:20:34,425
I'm not choosing you.

544
00:20:34,434 --> 00:20:36,904
- Well, then, please,
tell Ms. Gibbs

545
00:20:36,903 --> 00:20:39,803
thank you for the courtesy.

546
00:20:47,981 --> 00:20:49,481
- Scottie, what are you
doing here?

547
00:20:49,482 --> 00:20:51,282

you sent him to me.

548

- Sent who?
- Oh, don't give me that.

549
00:20:52,819 --> 00:20:53,919
The last time
you came to me,

550
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,490
you said it was
because Mike made you.

551
00:20:55,488 --> 00:20:57,218
Well, this time,
you made him.

552
00:20:57,223 --> 00:20:58,593
-I didn't made him do anything.

553
00:20:58,591 --> 00:20:59,921
- Well, then, you taught him
well, because he came to me

554
00:20:59,926 --> 00:21:01,086
and pulled on my heart strings

555
00:21:01,094 --> 00:21:02,394
to get me to do
something for you,

556
00:21:02,395 --> 00:21:03,995
but this time
the answer is no.

557
00:21:03,997 --> 00:21:06,127
I am not going after
Anita Gibbs.

558
00:21:06,132 --> 00:21:08,402
- Scottie, I would never ask you
to do something like that.

559
00:21:08,401 --> 00:21:10,601
- That's funny, because you
asked me to throw a case

560
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:11,943
to keep Mike
from getting caught.

561
00:21:11,938 --> 00:21:14,138
- Throwing a case doesn't put
a target on your back.

562
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:16,340
- If you really wanted to keep
a target off my back,

563
00:21:16,342 --> 00:21:18,542
you never would've told me
about Mike in the first place.

564
00:21:18,544 --> 00:21:20,714
- Scottie, I didn't tell him
to do that.

565
00:21:20,713 --> 00:21:22,883
- Well, then, I guess you two
are having the same problem

566
00:21:22,882 --> 00:21:26,182
we did: You don't talk
to each other.

567
00:21:26,185 --> 00:21:29,115
Since you chose him over me
it's not my problem anymore.

568
00:21:29,122 --> 00:21:30,692
- I didn't chose him over you.

569
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:32,220
- Yes, you did.

570
00:21:32,225 --> 00:21:33,455
And whether you choose
to admit it or not,

571
00:21:33,459 --> 00:21:34,459
it was Mike's secret

572
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:36,190
that broke us up
in the first place.

573
00:21:48,941 --> 00:21:50,511
- You let her in here
without telling me?

574
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:52,010
- I was in the conference room,
going over discovery.

575
00:21:52,011 --> 00:21:53,681
What are you going to do?

576
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,050
- I don't know what I'm gonna
do, but whatever it is,

577
00:21:55,048 --> 00:21:56,708
I'm gonna do it right now.
- Harvey, calm down.

578
00:21:56,716 --> 00:21:58,946
- I'm not gonna calm down,
you told me to go after Gibbs

579
00:21:58,951 --> 00:22:00,721
to stop Mike from doing
something stupid,

580
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,890
and I did, and all that did
was waste our time

581
00:22:02,889 --> 00:22:04,289
like I said it would.
- Harvey.

582
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:07,160
Gibbs is attacking Rachel,
the woman he loves.

583
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,190
You of all people should be
able to understand that.

584
00:22:09,195 --> 00:22:10,385
- I don't give a shit.

585
00:22:10,396 --> 00:22:12,726
He had no right to go after
someone I love.

586
00:22:13,766 --> 00:22:15,296
- Okay, you know what, Harvey?

587
00:22:15,301 --> 00:22:17,771
Mike is the one on trial here,
not Scottie.

588
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:19,440
And all he did was ask her
to do something.

589
00:22:19,439 --> 00:22:21,509
So maybe the thing that you're
really upset about

590
00:22:21,507 --> 00:22:22,837
is that she was right.

591
00:22:29,482 --> 00:22:31,382
- Well, how did it go?

592
00:22:31,384 --> 00:22:34,294

each other a long time, Jack,

593

but it's not gonna happen.

594

You said if I could
get them double--

595
00:22:39,792 --> 00:22:42,732
- I said it would take at least
double just to get me to ask.

596
00:22:42,729 --> 00:22:44,429
I did, and they laughed me
out of the room.

597
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:45,960
- What if I could
get you more?

598
00:22:45,965 --> 00:22:47,525
- There's no number that's
going to get them to come

599
00:22:47,533 --> 00:22:49,533
to Pearson Specter because they
don't believe there's gonna be

00:22:49,535 --> 00:22:50,565
a firm to come to.

601
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:53,140
- Then why did you ask
to meet me here?

602
00:22:53,139 --> 00:22:55,569
- Because after I asked them
about your offer,

603
00:22:55,575 --> 00:22:57,265
I asked them about mine.

604
00:22:58,277 --> 00:22:59,477
- What are you talking about?

605
00:22:59,479 --> 00:23:01,409
- I told them a former
fraternity brother of mine,

606
00:23:01,414 --> 00:23:02,954
who happens to be
a kick-ass lawyer

607

You're offering me a job?

609
00:23:06,919 --> 00:23:09,489
- Jack, Pearson Specter's

610
00:23:09,489 --> 00:23:10,819
- We've taken on some water.

611

You've taken on an ocean.

614
00:23:16,028 --> 00:23:18,898
Because if that ship sinks,
I'll find myself another job.

615

But if it doesn't,

00:26:35,962 --> 00:26:37,232
- Rachel, we've been
over this.

676
00:26:37,229 --> 00:26:38,999
She was lying.

677
00:26:38,998 --> 00:26:42,168
- That was before I knew she
was able to get to the dean.

678
00:26:42,168 --> 00:26:43,428
- What are you talking about?

679
00:26:43,436 --> 00:26:45,036
- I had my meeting
with him today,

680
00:26:45,037 --> 00:26:46,437
and I thought he was
going to tell me

681
00:26:46,439 --> 00:26:48,909
how well I've been doing,
and instead...

682
00:26:48,908 --> 00:26:51,178
he threatened to expel me.

683
00:26:52,111 --> 00:26:53,941
- [sighs]

684
00:26:53,946 --> 00:26:55,776
Okay.

685
00:26:55,781 --> 00:26:58,181
Okay, that--that doesn't mean
that it was Gibbs.

686
00:26:58,184 --> 00:27:00,224
- You weren't there.
- No, I wasn't there, all right?

687
00:27:00,219 --> 00:27:03,389
But it's not crazy to assume
that they would question

688
00:27:03,389 --> 00:27:05,919
whether or not you knew about me
without talking to Gibbs.

689
00:27:05,925 --> 00:27:08,225
- Is it crazy for them
to mention a crime

690
00:27:08,227 --> 00:27:11,327
you haven't even been accused of
without talking to Gibbs?

691
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:12,730
- What?
- They said there are rumors

692
00:27:12,732 --> 00:27:14,132
of you taking the LSATs
for people

693
00:27:14,133 --> 00:27:17,533
and they're accusing you
of doing that for me.

694
00:27:20,573 --> 00:27:24,983
- Well...at least now
I know what I need to do.

695
00:27:29,682 --> 00:27:30,912
- Harvey.

696
00:27:30,916 --> 00:27:32,576
I know how we can stop Gibbs
from pressuring Rachel.

697
00:27:32,585 --> 00:27:35,915
- Does it involve going
to Scottie without telling me?

698
00:27:35,921 --> 00:27:37,621
- Harvey.
- Goddamn it, you had no right.

699
00:27:37,623 --> 00:27:39,323
- I had every right,
because I knew Gibson

700
00:27:39,325 --> 00:27:41,685
would keep crossing lines,
and that's exactly what she did.

701
00:27:41,694 --> 00:27:42,794
- What are you talking about?

702
00:27:42,795 --> 00:27:43,955
- She manipulated
the Dean of Columbia

703
00:27:43,963 --> 00:27:45,203
into threatening
to expel Rachel.

704
00:27:45,197 --> 00:27:46,457
- Where's your proof?

705
00:27:46,465 --> 00:27:49,195
- They accused her of having me
take the LSATs for her,

706
00:27:49,201 --> 00:27:51,041
and the only problem is,
there's no record of me

707
00:27:51,037 --> 00:27:52,437
ever having
being accused of that.

708
00:27:52,438 --> 00:27:55,068
- The guy you saw in court.
- Yes, his name is David Green.

709
00:27:55,074 --> 00:27:57,614
He must've told Gibbs about me,
and then she used that

710
00:27:57,610 --> 00:27:59,340
to get the dean
to strong-arm Rachel.

711
00:27:59,345 --> 00:28:00,705
That's abuse of power.

712
00:28:00,713 --> 00:28:02,653
- I told you, the only problem
with that theory is,

713
00:28:02,648 --> 00:28:04,108
David Green tells Gibbs
about you,

714
00:28:04,116 --> 00:28:05,176
and his career is done.

715
00:28:05,184 --> 00:28:06,754
- Then he must've told her
anonymously.

716
00:28:06,752 --> 00:28:08,192
- Which doesn't help us,
'cause we still don't have

717
00:28:08,187 --> 00:28:09,847
any proof that she
contacted the dean.

718
00:28:09,855 --> 00:28:12,985
- No, we don't, but it wouldn't
be that hard for me to get.

719
00:28:12,992 --> 00:28:15,162
- No, it could be a setup.
It's too risky.

720
00:28:15,161 --> 00:28:17,061
- This whole goddamn thing
is too risky,

721
00:28:17,063 --> 00:28:19,233
but right now Rachel's future
is in jeopardy,

722
00:28:19,231 --> 00:28:21,831
and if I have to risk tacking on
a few years to save her,

723
00:28:21,834 --> 00:28:23,934
is not even a close call.

724
00:28:26,072 --> 00:28:27,572
- All right.
Do what you have to do.

725
00:28:27,573 --> 00:28:29,373
Just don't get caught.

726
00:28:33,746 --> 00:28:35,706
[knocking]

727
00:28:35,715 --> 00:28:37,145
- You're knocking.

728
00:28:37,149 --> 00:28:39,979
That means it's either bad news
or you want something.

729
00:28:39,985 --> 00:28:42,515
- I couldn't get the department.
- Don't tell me.

730
00:28:42,521 --> 00:28:45,291
They said we're in no position
to poach anybody.

731
00:28:45,291 --> 00:28:46,691
- That's exactly
what they said,

732
00:28:46,692 --> 00:28:48,662
right before they
offered me a job.

733
00:28:48,661 --> 00:28:51,701
- So you're here to tell me
you took it.

734
00:28:51,697 --> 00:28:53,797
- I'm here to ask you
if you want me to take it.

735
00:28:53,799 --> 00:28:56,499
- What the hell difference
does it make what I want?

736
00:28:56,502 --> 00:28:59,702
- Jessica, when I left Boston,
people said I was a traitor

737
00:28:59,705 --> 00:29:03,005
and that I thought I was
too good for my own hometown.

738
00:29:03,008 --> 00:29:04,678
Well, it wasn't true.

739
00:29:04,677 --> 00:29:06,377
But I knew
the real test for me

740
00:29:06,378 --> 00:29:07,978
wasn't making it
in my own hometown.

741
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:09,550
It was making it
in the toughest city

742
00:29:09,548 --> 00:29:11,418
in the world, and as far
as I'm concerned,

743
00:29:11,417 --> 00:29:15,717
I haven't done that yet.

744
00:29:15,721 --> 00:29:18,021
- You want to be made
name partner.

745
00:29:18,023 --> 00:29:20,893
- I wanna know if it'll ever
even be on the table.

746
00:29:20,893 --> 00:29:24,293
- I could say yes
to that right now,

747
00:29:24,296 --> 00:29:27,556
but how would you know
you could trust me?

748
00:29:27,566 --> 00:29:29,596
- I have no other choice.

749

<i> [dramatic music]</i>

750
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:33,640
- And how do I know
I can trust you?

What's this?
- You know what it is.

752
00:29:43,916 --> 00:29:46,416
- It's what Daniel Hardman
has on you.

753
00:29:47,887 --> 00:29:49,287
- Now you have it too.

754
00:29:58,964 --> 00:30:00,764
- David Green.

755
00:30:02,401 --> 00:30:03,401
- What are you doing here?

756
00:30:03,402 --> 00:30:04,542
- So you do remember me.

757
00:30:04,537 --> 00:30:05,597
- Of course I do.

758
00:30:05,604 --> 00:30:07,814
You're the guy
we're prosecuting.

759
00:30:07,807 --> 00:30:08,907
The fake lawyer.

760
00:30:08,908 --> 00:30:11,108
- Oh, I'm more than that
and you know it.

761
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:12,280
- What are you talking about?

762
00:30:12,278 --> 00:30:14,038
- You hired me
because I'm smart.

763
00:30:14,046 --> 00:30:16,446
What you don't know is that
I have a photographic memory,

764
00:30:16,448 --> 00:30:18,848
which means I have
your drivers license number

765
00:30:18,851 --> 00:30:20,751
from seven years ago memorized.

766
00:30:20,753 --> 00:30:23,453
Not that it matters, because
I also made a copy.

767
00:30:23,455 --> 00:30:26,115
Like I made a copy of all
my clients' licenses.

768
00:30:26,125 --> 00:30:27,515
- That doesn't prove anything.

769
00:30:27,526 --> 00:30:29,886
- Maybe not, but I also remember
every answer I put down

770
00:30:29,895 --> 00:30:31,895
on a 104 question test.

771
00:30:31,897 --> 00:30:33,557
If that's not proof,
I don't know what is.

772
00:30:33,566 --> 00:30:35,096
- What do you want?

773
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:37,100
- I want proof that Anita Gibbs'
pressuring the Dean of Columbia

774
00:30:37,102 --> 00:30:38,902
to expel Rachel Zane.

775
00:30:38,904 --> 00:30:40,874
- I can't do that.
- Yes, you can.

776
00:30:43,542 --> 00:30:45,142
- Okay, they went
to law school together.

777
00:30:45,144 --> 00:30:47,084
There's your connection.

778
00:30:47,079 --> 00:30:50,709
- Circumstantial public record
not good enough.

779
00:30:50,716 --> 00:30:52,276
- I do what you're asking
and get caught,

780
00:30:52,284 --> 00:30:54,324
and my career at the U.S.
Attorney's office is over.

781
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,520
- I give what I have
to the D.A.,

782
00:30:55,521 --> 00:30:57,021
and your career as a lawyer
is over.

783
00:30:57,022 --> 00:30:58,392
- If you do that, you only
implicate yourself.

784
00:30:58,390 --> 00:30:59,690
- Yeah, maybe
you didn't notice, asshole,

785
00:30:59,692 --> 00:31:01,562
but I'm already on trial,
and now you're coming

after the woman I love.

787
00:31:02,828 --> 00:31:05,098
And the truth is you don't
deserve to practice law.

788
00:31:05,097 --> 00:31:06,927
Maybe I don't either,
but she does.

789
00:31:06,932 --> 00:31:08,672
And, believe me,
when it comes to this,

790
00:31:08,667 --> 00:31:12,497
I really don't give a shit
about me or you.

791
00:31:12,504 --> 00:31:14,444
- And what if I can't find
what you're looking for?

792
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,810
- You know what, David?

793
00:31:15,808 --> 00:31:19,978
You might not have been smart
enough to get 178 on the LSATs,

794
00:31:19,979 --> 00:31:22,549
but I'm pretty damn sure
you're smart enough to do that.

795
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:32,820
- What's this?

796
00:31:32,825 --> 00:31:34,255
- That's what
you're gonna sign.

797
00:31:37,529 --> 00:31:39,059
- This says you're dropping
a charge

798
00:31:39,064 --> 00:31:41,474
of malicious prosecution
in exchange for me admitting

799
00:31:41,467 --> 00:31:42,767
a sanctionable offense.

800
00:31:42,768 --> 00:31:44,898
- And for backing the hell off
going after Rachel Zane.

801
00:31:44,904 --> 00:31:46,274
- Is this a joke?
- No.

802
00:31:46,272 --> 00:31:48,112
And neither is getting
the Dean of Columbia Law

803
00:31:48,107 --> 00:31:49,407
to do your dirty work.

804
00:31:49,408 --> 00:31:50,768
- I don't know what
you're talking about.

805
00:31:50,776 --> 00:31:52,236
- You know exactly
what we're talking about.

806
00:31:52,244 --> 00:31:53,684
And unless you want us
to tell the world

807
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:54,879
that you intimidated a witness

808
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,010

law school buddy,

809
00:31:57,016 --> 00:31:58,076
you're going to sign that.

00:31:58,083 --> 00:31:59,323

a shred of proof

00:31:59,318 --> 00:32:00,918
that I had anyone do anything.

812
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,950
- I have a copy of an anonymous
tip sent to you,

813
00:32:02,955 --> 00:32:04,345
saying I took the LSATs
for people,

814
00:32:04,356 --> 00:32:06,386
and a record of a phone call
from your office

815
00:32:06,392 --> 00:32:08,932
to the Dean of Columbia
ten minutes later.

816
00:32:08,928 --> 00:32:10,158
- That's no proof of anything.

817
00:32:10,162 --> 00:32:12,262
- It's proof enough for us
to sue Dean Herrick

818
00:32:12,264 --> 00:32:13,504
for every penny
he's ever made.

819
00:32:13,499 --> 00:32:15,069
You think when we get him
in a deposition

820
00:32:15,067 --> 00:32:16,127
he isn't gonna crack?

821
00:32:23,909 --> 00:32:26,239
- You think you're pretty smart,
don't you?

822
00:32:26,245 --> 00:32:27,635
- Smart enough to outwit
a U .S. Attorney.

823
00:32:27,646 --> 00:32:29,176
- And if we can do it here,
what makes you think

824
00:32:29,181 --> 00:32:30,411
we won't be able to do it
in court?

825
00:32:30,416 --> 00:32:32,046
- Because court is not about
bullshit like this.

826
00:32:32,051 --> 00:32:33,351
It's about facts.

827
00:32:33,352 --> 00:32:35,792
And the fact is, you're not
a goddamn lawyer.

You got it done.
