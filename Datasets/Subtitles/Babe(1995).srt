00:02:31,114 --> 00:02:34,316
This is a tale about<br/>an unprejudiced heart...

2
00:02:34,408 --> 00:02:37,693
and how it changed our valley forever.

3
00:02:37,744 --> 00:02:40,032
There was a time not so long ago...

4
00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:44,539
when pigs were afforded no<br/>respect except by other pigs.

5
00:02:44,582 --> 00:02:49,623
They lived their whole lives<br/>in a cruel and sunless world.

6
00:03:03,847 --> 00:03:08,757
In those days, pigs believed that<br/>the sooner they grew large and fat,

7
00:03:08,809 --> 00:03:11,809
the sooner they'd be<br/>taken into pig paradise.

8
00:03:11,895 --> 00:03:15,594
- Haa! Haa! Get up!<br/>- A place so wonderful...

9
00:03:15,647 --> 00:03:19,775
- that no pig had ever thought to come back.<br/>- Yo! Yeah!

10
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:30,819
Good-bye, Mom.

11
00:03:30,909 --> 00:03:36,447
So when the day came for their parents to<br/>go to that other world of endless pleasures,

12
00:03:36,496 --> 00:03:39,165
it was not a time for<br/>young pigs to be sad.

13
00:03:39,249 --> 00:03:44,490
Just another step towards the day<br/>when they, too, would make the journey.

14
00:03:57,054 --> 00:04:01,382
Perhaps it was because he was alone.

15
00:04:01,474 --> 00:04:04,924
Perhaps his sadness<br/>made him easier to catch.

16
00:04:04,976 --> 00:04:08,475
Whatever the reason, of the thousands<br/>of animals in the piggery that day...

17
00:04:08,562 --> 00:04:11,266
only one was chosen.

18
00:04:11,314 --> 00:04:13,520
- How's this one, Harry?<br/>- Just right for the purpose.

19
00:04:13,608 --> 00:04:17,818
- How much do I owe you?<br/>- It's a runt, Harry. A worthless, little runt.

20
00:04:33,164 --> 00:04:36,413
You're too modest, Esme Hoggett.

21
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,907
Nine out of ten first prizes<br/>for jams and jellies...

22
00:04:39,002 --> 00:04:40,910
is more than a matter of luck.

23
00:04:41,003 --> 00:04:44,585
Luck still plays its part. Our<br/>berries were wickedly good this year.

24
00:04:44,673 --> 00:04:47,245
And our water is very tasty too.

25
00:04:47,341 --> 00:04:50,045
Of course, we don't use the town water.

26
00:04:52,679 --> 00:04:56,806
Arthur Hoggett! How's it going, Arthur?

27
00:04:56,849 --> 00:04:59,256
How are those sheep of<br/>yours? Come on, try your luck.

28
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:03,050
How about taking a guess,<br/>Arthur? All for a good cause.

29
00:05:05,522 --> 00:05:10,229
- Don't keep pigs.<br/>- Christmas day. Think of it. What a feast!

30
00:05:11,485 --> 00:05:14,057
That'll do, Pig.

31
00:05:16,864 --> 00:05:21,524
The pig and the farmer<br/>regarded each other.

32
00:05:21,617 --> 00:05:25,234
And for a fleeting moment,<br/>something passed between them.

33
00:05:25,328 --> 00:05:30,238
- A faint sense of some common destiny.<br/>- Hah. Strange.

34
00:05:30,332 --> 00:05:32,869
First time the little thing<br/>hasn't screamed its head off.

35
00:05:32,917 --> 00:05:36,285
Now you'll have to have a guess.

36
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:40,375
Sixteen pounds, five-

37
00:05:42,341 --> 00:05:44,463
Eew.

38
00:05:48,846 --> 00:05:50,755
Two ounces.

39
00:05:56,685 --> 00:05:59,222
Hooey! Hoggett!

40
00:05:59,312 --> 00:06:01,221
Hooey! Hoggett!

41
00:06:01,272 --> 00:06:04,770
Thanks, Arthur. We'll be<br/>weighing the little pig tomorrow.

42
00:06:04,858 --> 00:06:07,146
We'll phone you if you win.

43
00:06:07,235 --> 00:06:11,278
When you win, Arthur. When you win!

44
00:06:11,363 --> 00:06:13,402
Care to guess the pig's weight, sir?

45
00:06:13,448 --> 00:06:15,689
Support the Lion's Club.

46
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,839
Ooh!

47
00:06:40,927 --> 00:06:42,835
What could we do with<br/>a pig, eh, Duchess?

48
00:06:42,928 --> 00:06:46,131
Just think. Two nice<br/>hams. Two sides of bacon.

49
00:06:46,222 --> 00:06:50,848
Oh, and pork chops, kidney,<br/>liver, chitlins, pickle his feet.

50
00:06:50,934 --> 00:06:53,804
- Save his blood for black<br/>puddin'. There's the telephone.

51
00:06:53,895 --> 00:06:55,554
Hoggett!

52
00:06:55,604 --> 00:06:59,186
Good news, Arthur. You've won the pig.

53
00:06:59,274 --> 00:07:01,480
Oh.

54
00:07:03,944 --> 00:07:08,107
Pigs are definitely stupid.

55
00:07:20,498 --> 00:07:22,455
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

56
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:27,867
- What is it, Mom?<br/>- That's a pig.

57
00:07:27,962 --> 00:07:30,452
- They'll eat him when he's big.<br/>- Will they eat us?

58
00:07:30,547 --> 00:07:34,496
Good heavens, no! The bosses<br/>only eat stupid animals...

59
00:07:34,592 --> 00:07:37,129
like sheep and ducks and chickens.

60
00:07:37,177 --> 00:07:41,126
Yea!

61
00:07:45,934 --> 00:07:48,555
It does look stupid, Mom.

62
00:07:48,644 --> 00:07:52,475
Not as stupid as sheep, mind you.<br/>But pigs are definitely stupid.

63
00:07:52,564 --> 00:07:56,014
Excuse me. No, we're not.

64
00:07:56,108 --> 00:07:59,144
- Good heavens! Who are you?<br/>- I'm a Large White.

65
00:07:59,194 --> 00:08:02,527
- Yes, that's your breed, dear. What's your name?<br/>- I don't know.

66
00:08:02,613 --> 00:08:06,859
What did your mother call you to tell<br/>you apart from your brothers and sisters?

67
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:09,072
Our mom called us all the same.

68
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,903
And what was that, dear?

69
00:08:10,994 --> 00:08:13,366
She called us all Babe.

70
00:08:13,455 --> 00:08:16,704
Perhaps we shouldn't talk<br/>too much about, uh, family.

71
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:22,080
I want my mom.

72
00:08:25,714 --> 00:08:29,497
There, there. You've got<br/>to be a brave boy now.

73
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:33,843
I left my mother when I was your age,<br/>and my pups will have to leave me soon.

74
00:08:33,887 --> 00:08:36,840
But I'll keep an eye on you, if you<br/>like, just 'til you find your feet.

75
00:08:42,518 --> 00:08:45,851
The little pig's a bit low.<br/>He's going to sleep with us...

76
00:08:45,937 --> 00:08:49,021
just 'til he finds his feet.

77
00:08:53,526 --> 00:08:56,692
Until he finds his feet.

78
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:01,187
But, Mom, he'll wet the bed!

79
00:09:01,282 --> 00:09:03,073
Nonsense!

80
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:06,278
If you do want to do anything,<br/>you'll go outside, won't you?

81
00:09:06,369 --> 00:09:11,030
Good boy.

82
00:09:11,081 --> 00:09:13,204
Yea!

83
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:16,867
Yeah! Yeah! Stomp on him!

84
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:19,588
What's your name, Pig?

85
00:09:19,671 --> 00:09:23,205
- What does he taste like?<br/>- Where did he come from?

86
00:09:44,189 --> 00:09:46,858
Comin' through! Hey, get lost!

87
00:09:56,157 --> 00:09:58,612
We've got to do<br/>something about that duck.

88
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:01,736
Ooh! Ooh!

89
00:10:01,786 --> 00:10:03,743
Doodle-loo-dee-doo.

90
00:10:03,829 --> 00:10:05,821
- What's that noise?<br/>- It's only Ferdinand.

91
00:10:05,914 --> 00:10:07,823
- What's Ferdinand?<br/>- He's a duck.

92
00:10:07,916 --> 00:10:10,916
- He wants to be a rooster.<br/>- He hates being a duck.

93
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:15,039
- We'll catch him one day and eat him. Won't we, Mom?<br/>- Yes, dear.

94
00:10:15,088 --> 00:10:20,425
Yech! Who'd want to eat a duck?

95
00:10:45,319 --> 00:10:48,485
Babe, you wait here.

96
00:10:48,571 --> 00:10:50,943
- Aren't pigs allowed?<br/>- Not live ones.

97
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:54,274
- Sorry, dear. Only dogs and cats inside the house.<br/>- Why?

98
00:10:54,367 --> 00:10:56,525
That's just the way things are.

99
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:13,457
Whoa!

100
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,884
- Ow! -<br/>Pig-pig-piggy!

101
00:11:18,969 --> 00:11:22,302
Ooh, what a spectacular<br/>feast I've got for you.

102
00:11:22,388 --> 00:11:25,472
Oh, yes! What a lucky<br/>little pork chop you are.

103
00:11:25,516 --> 00:11:28,136
Delicious! Oh, yes! Yum, yum, yum.

104
00:11:28,184 --> 00:11:30,556
Who's gonna grow up<br/>to be a big, fat pig?

105
00:11:30,644 --> 00:11:34,724
You are! You are! Yum, yum, yum.

106
00:11:43,946 --> 00:11:46,697
- Where are we going?<br/>- To work with the sheep.

107
00:11:46,782 --> 00:11:49,865
- What's sheep?<br/>- Sheep is animals with thick, woolly coats.

108
00:11:49,951 --> 00:11:52,488
And thick woolly heads. And men<br/>can't look after them without us.

109
00:11:52,536 --> 00:11:57,991
- Why do they need us?<br/>'Cause we're sheepdogs! Yea!

110
00:12:10,174 --> 00:12:13,009
- Not you, dear.<br/>- Why not?

111
00:12:13,051 --> 00:12:17,262
We have to do dogs' work. You're a pig.<br/>Your job is to stay here and eat your food.

112
00:12:17,346 --> 00:12:20,512
We'll be back at the end of the day.

113
00:12:28,438 --> 00:12:32,304
They don't think I'll<br/>remember. Well, I don't forget.

114
00:12:32,357 --> 00:12:35,358
Seems like a sheep's<br/>just born to suffer.

115
00:12:35,443 --> 00:12:37,850
Hello? Excuse me.

116
00:12:37,903 --> 00:12:39,895
Darn wolf!

117
00:12:39,988 --> 00:12:44,448
- I'm not a wolf. I'm a pig. What are you?<br/>- Ewe.

118
00:12:44,533 --> 00:12:46,525
Pig. What are you?

119
00:12:46,618 --> 00:12:49,453
I'm a ewe. A ewe!

120
00:12:49,537 --> 00:12:53,616
- You're a sheep!<br/>- I'll not be called a common sheep, thank you kindly.

121
00:12:53,707 --> 00:12:56,376
I'm a Border Leicester<br/>ewe. The name's Maa.

122
00:12:56,417 --> 00:12:59,086
Oh.

123
00:12:59,169 --> 00:13:03,166
- What's wrong with you, Maa?<br/>- Foot rot. And I got me a nasty cough.

124
00:13:03,214 --> 00:13:07,424
And I'm not as young as I used to be.

125
00:13:11,554 --> 00:13:13,510
Hmph.

126
00:13:16,933 --> 00:13:20,431
- Seem like a nice young pig. What be your name?<br/>- Babe.

127
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:23,389
Not like them wolves. Treat<br/>you like dirt, they do!

128
00:13:23,438 --> 00:13:26,521
- Bite you as soon as look at you, those savages!<br/>- Bite you?

129
00:13:26,565 --> 00:13:29,055
And worse. Some wolves be so bad,

130
00:13:29,108 --> 00:13:31,397
they run a sheep down<br/>and tear it to pieces.

131
00:13:31,485 --> 00:13:33,892
Fly would never do that!

132
00:13:33,987 --> 00:13:37,818
Fly, is it? A right vicious<br/>creature she be, I'll tell you.

133
00:13:37,907 --> 00:13:41,820
- Not Fly.<br/>- All them wolves is cruel to sheep. Always have been.

134
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:44,744
Brutal savages! That's what they be.

135
00:13:44,787 --> 00:13:49,080
I wouldn't want to see a gentle soul<br/>like you mixin' with the likes of them.

136
00:14:00,924 --> 00:14:03,414
That afternoon when he saw Fly,

137
00:14:03,468 --> 00:14:06,670
the pig's mind was a<br/>tangle of questions.

138
00:14:06,762 --> 00:14:09,928
Cruel, vicious, brutal?

139
00:14:09,973 --> 00:14:13,921
What was it that dogs<br/>did in the fields all day?

140
00:14:13,976 --> 00:14:18,268
- Hello, Babe? Had a good day?<br/>- Yes, thank you.

141
00:14:27,527 --> 00:14:31,690
The old sheep had to be wrong about Fly.

142
00:14:31,781 --> 00:14:37,236
And the pig promised himself that he would<br/>never think badly of any creature ever again.

143
00:14:40,829 --> 00:14:44,162
Crime and Punishment!

144
00:14:44,248 --> 00:14:47,284
The morning of the terrible crime...

145
00:14:47,334 --> 00:14:50,120
started like any other on Hoggett Farm.

146
00:14:50,169 --> 00:14:53,123
Comin' through! Comin' through!

147
00:14:53,213 --> 00:14:56,130
Take off!

148
00:14:58,217 --> 00:15:01,052
- Now!<br/>- Up, up, up.

149
00:15:01,136 --> 00:15:03,626
Nee-nee-nee-nee.

150
00:15:03,721 --> 00:15:05,381
Hmm?

151
00:15:05,473 --> 00:15:09,469
I was worried it might have a harsh tone,<br/>but that's quite a nice musical ring.

152
00:15:09,559 --> 00:15:13,805
I walked into O'Halloran's Hardware,<br/>and there it was waiting for me.

153
00:15:13,896 --> 00:15:16,018
What a splendid way to<br/>wake up each morning!

154
00:15:16,106 --> 00:15:18,643
Hoggett, dear. Church.

155
00:15:25,613 --> 00:15:28,566
When embarking on an audacious crime,

156
00:15:28,657 --> 00:15:31,361
a duck needs a willing accomplice.

157
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:34,404
A creature who is<br/>reliable, beyond suspicion,

158
00:15:34,494 --> 00:15:36,819
and above all, extremely gullible.

159
00:15:36,913 --> 00:15:38,739
Hey! Psst!

160
00:15:38,831 --> 00:15:40,870
Wha<br/>- What?

161
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:44,207
You look like an intelligent,<br/>sophisticated, discerning young fella.

162
00:15:44,293 --> 00:15:49,203
- Who, me?<br/>- Yeah. Follow me. Oh, boy! Are you in for some fun!

163
00:15:49,297 --> 00:15:52,500
What are we doin'? Where are we goin'?

164
00:15:54,301 --> 00:15:57,337
Now the duck knew<br/>exactly what he had to do.

165
00:15:57,428 --> 00:16:02,587
- The alarm clock had to go. His very life depended on it.<br/>- Do you see it?

166
00:16:02,682 --> 00:16:06,300
- Yes.<br/>- Good.

167
00:16:06,393 --> 00:16:09,559
So I go through the kitchen,<br/>across the living room...

168
00:16:09,604 --> 00:16:11,810
- Good, good.<br/>- into the bedroom.

169
00:16:11,897 --> 00:16:14,304
Get the mechanical rooster<br/>and bring it out to you.

170
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:17,353
- What about that cat?<br/>- But quietly bring it out to you.

171
00:16:17,443 --> 00:16:19,685
- Excellent.<br/>- I don't think I can do it.

172
00:16:19,778 --> 00:16:22,981
It's against the rules. Only dogs<br/>and cats allowed in the house.

173
00:16:23,073 --> 00:16:27,484
It's a good rule, but this is bigger<br/>than rules. This is life and death.

174
00:16:27,576 --> 00:16:30,113
- It is? -<br/>Mm-hmm. Follow me.

175
00:16:31,621 --> 00:16:35,036
Hello! Look, there's<br/>something you should know.

176
00:16:35,123 --> 00:16:38,823
- Humans eat ducks!<br/>- I beg your pardon?

177
00:16:38,918 --> 00:16:43,045
Most ducks prefer to forget it, but the<br/>fact is that humans like to eat plump ducks.

178
00:16:43,129 --> 00:16:46,295
I don't think so. Not the<br/>boss. Not the boss's wife.

179
00:16:46,382 --> 00:16:49,086
Come on. Humans don't eat cats. Why?

180
00:16:49,134 --> 00:16:51,375
- Well, they're- - They're<br/>indispensable. They catch mice.

181
00:16:51,469 --> 00:16:55,797
Humans don't eat roosters. Why? They make eggs<br/>with the hens and wake up everyone in the morning.

182
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:57,798
I tried it with the<br/>hens. It didn't work.

183
00:16:57,890 --> 00:17:00,725
So I turned to crowing,<br/>and lo! I discover my gift.

184
00:17:00,809 --> 00:17:04,972
But no sooner do I become indispensable<br/>than they bring in a machine to do the job!

185
00:17:05,021 --> 00:17:07,476
Ah, the treachery of it!

186
00:17:07,523 --> 00:17:10,309
- A mechanical rooster!<br/>- Oh, dear me.

187
00:17:10,358 --> 00:17:14,141
Oh, dear you?

188
00:17:14,194 --> 00:17:16,767
I suppose the life<br/>of an anorexic duck...

189
00:17:16,821 --> 00:17:19,738
doesn't amount to much in<br/>the broad scheme of things.

190
00:17:19,824 --> 00:17:21,816
But, Pig,

191
00:17:21,908 --> 00:17:24,695
I'm all I've got.

192
00:17:24,786 --> 00:17:26,694
Why do you need me to do it?

193
00:17:26,787 --> 00:17:29,787
- I'm allergic to cats.<br/>- Oh.

194
00:17:29,831 --> 00:17:32,203
They make me sneeze.

195
00:17:32,291 --> 00:17:34,248
Ahh.

196
00:17:35,419 --> 00:17:40,163
Don't worry. I won't wake the cat.

197
00:17:41,632 --> 00:17:43,754
My life is in your hands.

198
00:17:43,842 --> 00:17:47,790
Oh, dear.

199
00:17:48,679 --> 00:17:50,671
Oh, no!

200
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:30,625
Ah, boy.

201
00:18:52,935 --> 00:18:56,434
No, no, no!

202
00:19:04,777 --> 00:19:08,560
Your foot, your foot! Take<br/>the string off your foot.

203
00:19:08,614 --> 00:19:12,562
Wait, wait. Let me put it<br/>this way. Stop. Turn around-

204
00:19:12,617 --> 00:19:14,739
Shh.

205
00:19:16,286 --> 00:19:19,286
No, no! The other way! Turn-

206
00:19:20,915 --> 00:19:23,072
No, stop! Oh!

207
00:19:24,542 --> 00:19:27,910
Stop! Stop, stop, stop!

208
00:19:34,133 --> 00:19:38,592
Don't, don't, stupid. Go outside... now.

209
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:42,253
- But you said you can't do without me.<br/>- I can. Trust me, I can.

210
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:45,431
- Are you sure? You're positive?<br/>- Yes!

211
00:19:45,516 --> 00:19:49,809
- Go outside and stand guard.<br/>- Okay. Good idea.

212
00:19:57,901 --> 00:20:01,518
Oh, boy. Want something done,<br/>you gotta do it yourself.

213
00:20:12,036 --> 00:20:14,906
- Hmm.<br/>- Guard against what?

214
00:20:14,997 --> 00:20:17,748
Ahh! Ahh! Don't worry.

215
00:20:17,832 --> 00:20:23,038
Stick with me and please, I<br/>beg you, not one more word.

216
00:20:23,086 --> 00:20:24,829
All right.

217
00:21:18,044 --> 00:21:20,451
Aah-

218
00:21:20,546 --> 00:21:22,918
Don't sneeze, Ferdie.

219
00:21:23,006 --> 00:21:25,876
- Just hold your<br/>breath. - Ahhh-

220
00:21:36,683 --> 00:21:41,677
Ah-choo!

221
00:22:24,553 --> 00:22:28,384
It was my mistake. I was trying<br/>to loosen things up a little.

222
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:31,045
But, no. Today proves<br/>that it doesn't work.

223
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:33,382
From now on, we'll<br/>all respect the rules.

224
00:22:33,476 --> 00:22:35,385
To each creature its own destiny.

225
00:22:35,477 --> 00:22:38,015
Every animal in its proper place.

226
00:22:38,063 --> 00:22:42,522
And a pig's proper place is under<br/>the old cart, not in the barn.

227
00:22:42,566 --> 00:22:45,436
And absolutely never in the house.

228
00:22:45,527 --> 00:22:48,313
- Is that understood?<br/>- Yes, sir.

229
00:22:48,362 --> 00:22:52,608
Now, Pig, regarding the<br/>company you keep. Being young,

230
00:22:52,699 --> 00:22:55,450
it's hard to discriminate,<br/>so I'll make it easy for you.

231
00:22:55,534 --> 00:22:59,068
I forbid you to talk<br/>to or consort with...

232
00:22:59,162 --> 00:23:01,866
that duck... ever.

233
00:23:01,956 --> 00:23:06,912
- Have I made myself clear?<br/>- Uh... what's "consort"?

234
00:23:07,001 --> 00:23:09,077
It means, young man,

235
00:23:09,169 --> 00:23:12,620
that you must not go<br/>anywhere near that duck.

236
00:23:12,714 --> 00:23:15,714
As for the fugitive duck, when he<br/>shows himself, let him know this:

237
00:23:15,799 --> 00:23:20,092
Being a duck he must behave like a duck.<br/>No more of this crowing and nonsense.

238
00:23:20,178 --> 00:23:23,546
He should accept what he<br/>is and be thankful for it.

239
00:23:23,597 --> 00:23:26,431
- That goes for all of us.<br/>- Here, here!

240
00:23:26,516 --> 00:23:31,058
Rex continued long into the night.

241
00:23:31,103 --> 00:23:33,308
Elsewhere, there was more talk.

242
00:23:33,396 --> 00:23:36,182
The subject was Christmas dinner...

243
00:23:36,231 --> 00:23:39,564
and whether that year the main<br/>course would be roast pork...

244
00:23:39,651 --> 00:23:42,900
or Duck a l'Orange.

245
00:23:42,986 --> 00:23:45,062
And pork is a nice, sweet meat.

246
00:23:45,155 --> 00:23:48,902
Then there's the crackling. That<br/>always adds interest and texture.

247
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:55,242
Get him!

248
00:23:55,329 --> 00:23:58,199
Get the pig! Get the pig! Get the pig!

249
00:23:58,248 --> 00:24:00,205
Get him! Get him!

250
00:24:27,437 --> 00:24:29,559
- Psst!<br/>- Ferdinand!

251
00:24:29,605 --> 00:24:31,929
- Everyone's been looking for you.<br/>- Shh. Shh.

252
00:24:31,982 --> 00:24:34,982
- What is this place?<br/>- What's happenin' out there?

253
00:24:35,067 --> 00:24:39,479
Rex isn't very happy.<br/>Boy, all these new rules!

254
00:24:39,571 --> 00:24:41,479
I'm not allowed to<br/>- Oops.

255
00:24:41,572 --> 00:24:43,564
Not allowed to what?

256
00:24:43,615 --> 00:24:46,485
Huh?

257
00:24:46,576 --> 00:24:50,988
- Piggy!<br/>- What? You didn't see me, all right?

258
00:24:51,079 --> 00:24:55,242
And I didn't see you. All right? Oops.

259
00:25:29,942 --> 00:25:33,108
The time comes for all creatures...

260
00:25:33,153 --> 00:25:35,109
when childhood ends...

261
00:25:35,154 --> 00:25:39,815
and the doorway opens<br/>to life as an adult.

262
00:25:39,866 --> 00:25:42,819
And so it was with Fly's pups.

263
00:25:45,662 --> 00:25:51,165
Though that time was<br/>all too soon for Fly.

264
00:25:51,208 --> 00:25:54,790
Puppy, puppy, puppy. Come on.

265
00:26:11,598 --> 00:26:13,970
In my pocket.

266
00:27:01,052 --> 00:27:05,049
Fly?

267
00:27:05,097 --> 00:27:07,967
May I call you Mom?

268
00:27:14,354 --> 00:27:16,559
And so it was that the pig...

269
00:27:16,647 --> 00:27:20,347
found his place in<br/>the world of the farm.

270
00:27:20,442 --> 00:27:24,937
And he was happy, even in his dreams.

271
00:27:49,255 --> 00:27:52,789
- Hello!<br/>- Folks, how are you? Merry Christmas!

272
00:27:54,926 --> 00:27:57,463
How's my favorite girl?

273
00:27:57,553 --> 00:28:00,588
Nanny's got a jellybean.

274
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,672
Give us a kiss.

275
00:28:02,765 --> 00:28:05,386
Guess what we're having<br/>for Christmas dinner.

276
00:28:05,434 --> 00:28:08,636
- Roast pork.<br/>- I hate pork.

277
00:28:08,728 --> 00:28:11,763
Darn silly carry-on, if you ask me.

278
00:28:11,813 --> 00:28:15,431
The cat says they call it Christmas.

279
00:28:15,525 --> 00:28:19,771
Christmas! Christmas dinner, yeah.

280
00:28:19,861 --> 00:28:22,233
Dinner means death.

281
00:28:22,321 --> 00:28:26,816
Death means carnage!<br/>Christmas means carnage!

282
00:28:26,866 --> 00:28:28,906
Christmas means carnage!

283
00:28:41,544 --> 00:28:43,501
Oooh.

284
00:28:48,966 --> 00:28:51,635
Yes!

285
00:28:56,222 --> 00:28:58,013
Wait.

286
00:28:58,098 --> 00:29:02,309
Eatin' pigs! Blaah! Barbarians!

287
00:29:02,393 --> 00:29:04,848
You're goin' back to the fields, Maa.

288
00:29:04,937 --> 00:29:07,937
Oh, young'un, tragic there<br/>ain't more of your kind.

289
00:29:07,981 --> 00:29:11,479
- I'll be thinkin' of ya always.<br/>- I could come visit you.

290
00:29:11,567 --> 00:29:14,353
I'd like that, but-

291
00:29:14,444 --> 00:29:17,230
Well, we shouldn't<br/>hope for too much. Ooh!

292
00:29:37,128 --> 00:29:40,044
And so, it was Christmas Eve.

293
00:29:40,130 --> 00:29:43,000
And time had run out for the pig.

294
00:29:43,090 --> 00:29:46,838
- Are you doing him tonight then?<br/>- Mmm.

295
00:29:46,927 --> 00:29:50,129
Good. The blood'll drain by morning.

296
00:29:51,013 --> 00:29:53,800
- Pity.<br/>- What's that?

297
00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:55,598
Nothin'.

298
00:29:55,642 --> 00:29:58,049
What on earth are you babbling on about?

299
00:30:01,855 --> 00:30:05,353
Shame to miss out on the best ham<br/>prize at next year's fair, is all.

300
00:30:05,441 --> 00:30:09,389
Nice plump haunches he's gettin'.

301
00:30:09,485 --> 00:30:12,770
Beautiful. Still...

302
00:30:12,821 --> 00:30:15,394
silly to wait, I suppose.

303
00:31:29,003 --> 00:31:30,995
Here it is!

304
00:31:31,047 --> 00:31:34,000
- The bird.<br/>- Yuck. Chicken?

305
00:31:34,049 --> 00:31:36,005
No, it's Duck a l'Orange.

306
00:31:36,050 --> 00:31:38,422
And, Mother, it looks absolutely superb.

307
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:41,464
- I'm not going to eat any of it!<br/>- This is fabulous.

308
00:31:41,554 --> 00:31:43,630
Ferdinand!

309
00:31:43,723 --> 00:31:47,672
If you're out here, who's that in there?

310
00:31:47,726 --> 00:31:51,058
Her name's Rosanna.

311
00:31:57,066 --> 00:31:59,603
Why Rosanna?

312
00:31:59,693 --> 00:32:04,484
- She had such a beautiful nature.<br/>- Oh, Ferdinand.

313
00:32:04,572 --> 00:32:06,611
- I can't take it anymore.<br/>- Really!

314
00:32:06,698 --> 00:32:11,904
The fear's too much for a<br/>duck. It eats away at the soul.

315
00:32:11,952 --> 00:32:16,198
There must be kinder dispositions<br/>in far-off gentler lands.

316
00:32:16,247 --> 00:32:18,572
The only way you'll find<br/>happiness is to accept...

317
00:32:18,624 --> 00:32:22,074
that the way things are<br/>is the way things are.

318
00:32:22,127 --> 00:32:25,246
The way things are stinks! I'm<br/>not gonna be a goner. I'm gone.

319
00:32:25,296 --> 00:32:27,418
I wish all of you the best of luck.

320
00:32:27,506 --> 00:32:31,205
- Where will you go?<br/>- No idea.

321
00:32:31,258 --> 00:32:33,416
But I'm a clever duck. I<br/>could do with an adventure.

322
00:32:33,468 --> 00:32:37,797
- I'll miss you, Ferdie.<br/>- Ferdie? No one's ever called me that before.

323
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:40,177
Hey, good luck, Pig. Huh?

324
00:32:40,265 --> 00:32:42,590
- I am outta here.<br/>- Bye, bye.

325
00:32:42,684 --> 00:32:46,977
Ow! Would you do me a favor, old thing?

326
00:32:47,062 --> 00:32:49,896
- Anything.<br/>- Open the gate, huh?

327
00:32:53,650 --> 00:32:57,398
Ah! Ah! Ahh!<br/>Ha-ha-ha! Whoa!

328
00:33:08,161 --> 00:33:12,324
The pig knew it was against<br/>the rules to leave the farm.

329
00:33:12,414 --> 00:33:16,458
But something was definitely wrong.

330
00:33:21,338 --> 00:33:24,753
How lovely, darling. What is it?

331
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:28,498
It's a fax machine. You can<br/>send us letters by phone.

332
00:33:28,593 --> 00:33:31,380
- Hmm.<br/>- Oh.

333
00:33:37,433 --> 00:33:40,184
At any other time, the pig<br/>would've been tickled pink...

334
00:33:40,269 --> 00:33:42,557
by his first visit to the sheep fields.

335
00:33:42,645 --> 00:33:44,887
But now there was fear in the air.

336
00:33:44,981 --> 00:33:49,641
Maa and her kind were under threat.

337
00:34:02,327 --> 00:34:06,822
Hey, Frank, feel like<br/>pork for dinner tonight?

338
00:34:06,872 --> 00:34:08,781
- Young'un, you're alive!<br/>- Maa!

339
00:34:10,166 --> 00:34:12,205
What's happening? Who are these men?

340
00:34:12,293 --> 00:34:14,865
I'll get him out. Come around, Sniff!

341
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:19,914
Where's our boss? It doesn't seem right.

342
00:34:31,849 --> 00:34:35,976
- What's wrong, dear?<br/>- It's the wrong one!

343
00:34:36,019 --> 00:34:39,138
I want the house I<br/>saw on the television!

344
00:34:39,188 --> 00:34:41,145
Oh, there, there.

345
00:35:09,419 --> 00:35:12,503
Get! Quick! Get the dog in.

346
00:35:14,298 --> 00:35:16,503
Out of the sheep! Come on!

347
00:35:16,549 --> 00:35:18,506
Let's go!

348
00:35:54,078 --> 00:35:56,829
Good dog.

349
00:36:01,125 --> 00:36:03,081
Good pig.

350
00:36:26,602 --> 00:36:29,223
Oooh.

351
00:36:35,609 --> 00:36:40,104
Oooh!

352
00:36:40,154 --> 00:36:44,779
- Hey, hey. Dad says his little porker's a watch pig.<br/>- Dearie me!

353
00:36:44,824 --> 00:36:47,990
If it's not a duck that<br/>thinks it's a rooster,

354
00:36:48,076 --> 00:36:52,618
it's a pig that thinks it's a dog!

355
00:36:52,705 --> 00:36:55,575
A pig that thinks it's a dog!

356
00:37:13,637 --> 00:37:18,014
A pig that thinks it's a dog!

357
00:37:22,561 --> 00:37:26,807
A washing machine, a<br/>radio, a new alarm clock.

358
00:37:26,897 --> 00:37:31,108
I think it's a lovely fax machine,<br/>darling, but can't you use it?

359
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:35,313
We already have one, Mom.<br/>That's the whole idea.

360
00:37:35,404 --> 00:37:38,024
We can send faxes to each other.

361
00:37:38,114 --> 00:37:41,031
Don't be afraid of it<br/>just because it's new.

362
00:37:41,116 --> 00:37:43,404
These accounts are a real worry, Arthur.

363
00:37:43,493 --> 00:37:46,280
Every month your expenditure<br/>is greater than your income.

364
00:37:46,329 --> 00:37:48,736
It's eating up your reserves.

365
00:37:48,830 --> 00:37:51,831
You need to modernize, get<br/>some sort of cash flow going.

366
00:37:51,874 --> 00:37:55,040
You're still using a horse<br/>and cart, for God's sakes.

367
00:37:56,753 --> 00:37:58,994
- Dad?<br/>- Funny, that.

368
00:37:59,046 --> 00:38:03,672
- What?<br/>- Those chickens, that pig.

369
00:38:03,717 --> 00:38:07,844
What's the pig got to do with anything?

370
00:38:07,886 --> 00:38:10,341
Nothing.

371
00:38:10,388 --> 00:38:14,171
Just look at them. The<br/>browns and the whites.

372
00:38:38,743 --> 00:38:41,115
Come, Rex. Come, Fly.

373
00:38:43,371 --> 00:38:45,328
Come, Pig.

374
00:38:46,374 --> 00:38:48,662
Come, Pig!

375
00:38:53,379 --> 00:38:57,589
Perhaps he's pleased with you<br/>for what you did yesterday.

376
00:38:57,674 --> 00:39:00,378
- I didn't do much.<br/>- If it wasn't for you, dear,

377
00:39:00,468 --> 00:39:02,756
they could've stolen the whole flock.

378
00:39:02,844 --> 00:39:06,462
- Is Rex unhappy with me?<br/>- Oh, he'll be all right.

379
00:39:06,556 --> 00:39:09,260
Just stay out of his way today.

380
00:39:13,936 --> 00:39:16,806
Way to be, Fly. Rex, come by.

381
00:39:53,049 --> 00:39:55,373
That'll do.

382
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:02,882
You're so quick. I'd never<br/>be able to fly like you can.

383
00:40:02,931 --> 00:40:05,422
Pigs aren't built to fly, dear.

384
00:40:05,516 --> 00:40:08,221
But speed isn't the<br/>thing. It's attitude.

385
00:40:08,269 --> 00:40:10,510
They just have to know who's boss.

386
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:24,986
Out you go.

387
00:40:38,166 --> 00:40:40,787
Mmm!

388
00:41:08,147 --> 00:41:11,349
Get 'em up, Pig.

389
00:41:11,441 --> 00:41:14,809
- He wants you to drive them out of the yard.<br/>- Away to me, Pig.

390
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:16,899
Remember, you have to dominate them.

391
00:41:16,987 --> 00:41:19,987
Do that and they'll do<br/>anything you want. Go.

392
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:23,197
Woof!

393
00:41:23,283 --> 00:41:25,441
Woof, woof, woof!

394
00:41:25,493 --> 00:41:27,984
Woof! Woof! Woof, woof, woof, woof!

395
00:41:33,041 --> 00:41:35,033
Woof, woof, woof!

396
00:41:42,673 --> 00:41:44,914
This is ridiculous, Mom.

397
00:41:45,008 --> 00:41:47,249
Nonsense. It's only your first try.

398
00:41:47,343 --> 00:41:50,047
But you're treating them like equals.<br/>They're sheep. They're inferior.

399
00:41:50,137 --> 00:41:53,303
- Ah, no they're not.<br/>- Of course they are!

400
00:41:53,348 --> 00:41:56,763
We are their masters. Let them doubt it<br/>for a second and they'll walk all over you.

401
00:41:56,850 --> 00:42:01,926
- Fly, get that pig out of there.<br/>- Make them feel inferior. Abuse them. Insult them.

402
00:42:02,021 --> 00:42:03,894
- But they'll laugh at me.<br/>- Then bite them.

403
00:42:03,981 --> 00:42:07,313
Be ruthless. Whatever it<br/>takes. Bend them to your will.

404
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:11,271
- Enough!<br/>- Go on! Go!

405
00:42:16,365 --> 00:42:19,365
Move along there, you-

406
00:42:19,409 --> 00:42:21,448
You, uh, big butt heads!

407
00:42:27,206 --> 00:42:30,954
- Ow!<br/>- Young'un, stop this nonsense.

408
00:42:31,043 --> 00:42:35,335
What's got into you? I just finished<br/>tellin' what a nice young pig you be.

409
00:42:35,379 --> 00:42:38,130
Maa, I was just trying to be a sheepdog.

410
00:42:38,215 --> 00:42:40,705
Hah! Enough wolves in<br/>the world already...

411
00:42:40,758 --> 00:42:43,331
without a nice lad<br/>like you turnin' nasty.

412
00:42:43,385 --> 00:42:45,377
You haven't got it in ya, young'un.

413
00:42:51,016 --> 00:42:55,926
You and I are descended<br/>from the great sheepdogs.

414
00:42:56,020 --> 00:42:58,178
We carry the bloodline<br/>of the Ancient Bahou.

415
00:42:58,230 --> 00:43:00,222
We stand for something.

416
00:43:00,273 --> 00:43:03,226
And today I watched in shame<br/>as all that was betrayed.

417
00:43:03,275 --> 00:43:06,857
- Rex, he's just a little pig.<br/>- All the greater the insult.

418
00:43:09,738 --> 00:43:13,356
I'm sorry I bit you. Are you all right?

419
00:43:13,408 --> 00:43:17,784
I wouldn't call that a bite, myself. You<br/>got teeth in that floppy mouth or just gums?

420
00:43:21,289 --> 00:43:24,704
You see, ladies, a heart of gold.

421
00:43:24,750 --> 00:43:27,869
Ahh. Heart of gold.

422
00:43:27,919 --> 00:43:30,539
No need for all this<br/>wolf nonsense, young'un.

423
00:43:30,587 --> 00:43:34,501
All a nice little pig<br/>like you need do is ask.

424
00:44:06,531 --> 00:44:09,152
Thanks very much. It<br/>was very kind of you.

425
00:44:09,241 --> 00:44:11,483
- A pleasure.<br/>- What a nice little pig!

426
00:44:18,999 --> 00:44:21,038
All right, how did you do it?

427
00:44:21,125 --> 00:44:23,876
I asked them, and they did<br/>it. I asked them nicely.

428
00:44:23,961 --> 00:44:26,498
We don't ask sheep, dear.<br/>We tell them what to do.

429
00:44:26,588 --> 00:44:29,541
I did, Mom. They were really friendly.

430
00:44:29,632 --> 00:44:34,008
Maybe Rex might be a little more<br/>friendly if I had a talk with him.

431
00:44:34,093 --> 00:44:38,172
No, no, no. You better leave that to me.

432
00:45:02,742 --> 00:45:04,201
Rex?

433
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:10,081
I know it was hard for you today...

434
00:45:10,206 --> 00:45:12,249
watching all that happening.

435
00:45:12,374 --> 00:45:15,585
But surely it's not<br/>worth all this misery.

436
00:45:15,710 --> 00:45:19,505
Please, dear, not on<br/>such a beautiful night.

437
00:45:19,630 --> 00:45:22,298
You put these ideas into his head!

438
00:45:22,382 --> 00:45:25,050
Two-faced<br/>traitorous wret-

439
00:45:32,222 --> 00:45:34,724
Get down!

440
00:45:34,849 --> 00:45:37,685
Down, Rex. Fly!

441
00:46:01,161 --> 00:46:04,622
A dark cloud had<br/>descended on the valley.

442
00:46:04,747 --> 00:46:07,749
And the pig felt that the<br/>troubles were all his fault.

443
00:46:07,874 --> 00:46:12,086
But he was certain that he knew<br/>how to put things right again.

444
00:46:12,211 --> 00:46:15,672
Oh, uh, e<br/>- excuse me, sir.

445
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:20,092
But I-I-I think<br/>all this trouble-

446
00:46:27,305 --> 00:46:30,766
Well, it's not distemper.<br/>Can't be rabies.

447
00:46:30,892 --> 00:46:33,435
Must be the hormones.

448
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:38,397
- What about Hoggett's notion, the dog jealous of the wee pig?<br/>- I don't see that myself.

449
00:46:38,522 --> 00:46:41,566
No. So what should we do?

450
00:46:41,691 --> 00:46:46,111
You can keep him locked up or...<br/>snip, snip. I can do it Tuesday.

451
00:46:46,195 --> 00:46:48,446
No.

452
00:46:48,530 --> 00:46:49,989
Or Wednesday.

453
00:46:50,114 --> 00:46:53,867
Hoggett doesn't want the dog<br/>operated on. He's a breeding dog.

454
00:46:53,992 --> 00:46:56,327
I can sedate him, of course,

455
00:46:56,452 --> 00:46:59,747
but he'll be useless as a working dog.

456
00:47:06,627 --> 00:47:11,172
- I'll give you pills<br/>to put in his food.

457
00:47:11,297 --> 00:47:14,091
Good dog.

458
00:47:16,843 --> 00:47:20,762
The Sheep Pig.

459
00:47:41,653 --> 00:47:45,197
A pig doing the work of a sheepdog?

460
00:47:45,322 --> 00:47:49,951
With Rex out of action and Fly injured from<br/>the fight, Farmer Hoggett had no choice.

461
00:47:50,034 --> 00:47:54,204
Maa! Maa! The boss has<br/>to give you some medicine.

462
00:47:54,329 --> 00:47:57,874
Oh, dear, I thought so!<br/>It's horrible stuff, that.

463
00:47:57,999 --> 00:48:03,336
- I know, but it's for the best.<br/>- Young'un, if you say so.

464
00:48:18,222 --> 00:48:20,015
Shoo! Shoo!

465
00:48:20,140 --> 00:48:22,684
When the thought first came to him,

466
00:48:22,809 --> 00:48:26,020
Farmer Hoggett dismissed<br/>it as mere whimsy.

467
00:48:26,145 --> 00:48:30,190
But, like most of his harebrained<br/>ideas, it wouldn't go away.

468
00:48:36,277 --> 00:48:39,572
- What are they doing?<br/>- It's a sheepdog trial.

469
00:48:39,697 --> 00:48:42,157
So it's like a<br/>competition for sheepdogs?

470
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:45,242
And their bosses. It's<br/>like an obstacle course.

471
00:48:45,368 --> 00:48:47,369
How do they decide who wins?

472
00:48:47,452 --> 00:48:51,747
It's time and mistakes. You get<br/>points for how quick you are.

473
00:48:51,872 --> 00:48:54,082
And they take points<br/>off for every mistake.

474
00:48:54,208 --> 00:48:57,877
Every time a sheep goes the wrong way,<br/>that's a mistake and you lose points.

475
00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:02,922
- Looks like fun!<br/>- For a sheepdog, there's no prouder moment.

476
00:49:03,048 --> 00:49:06,342
- Rex and I<br/>used to- - Hmm?

477
00:49:06,425 --> 00:49:09,094
Never mind.

478
00:49:09,219 --> 00:49:12,054
Oh.

479
00:49:12,138 --> 00:49:15,307
Was Rex a champion?

480
00:49:15,432 --> 00:49:20,561
He had the makings of the greatest champion<br/>there ever was, but it wasn't to be.

481
00:49:20,686 --> 00:49:25,356
- What happened?<br/>- A while back when Rex was in his prime,

482
00:49:25,439 --> 00:49:29,109
the winter rains brought a<br/>great flood to the valley.

483
00:49:29,234 --> 00:49:32,528
Rex and the boss got most of<br/>the flock onto the high ground.

484
00:49:32,611 --> 00:49:35,655
Then Rex went back to<br/>look for the strays.

485
00:49:35,780 --> 00:49:39,408
He found them. They'd been<br/>stranded by the rising water.

486
00:49:40,993 --> 00:49:45,413
He tried to herd them across to<br/>safety, but they wouldn't budge.

487
00:49:45,496 --> 00:49:49,457
Too afraid and too stupid<br/>to save their own skins.

488
00:49:49,583 --> 00:49:53,127
It was freezing cold and<br/>the water kept rising.

489
00:49:53,252 --> 00:49:57,463
Rex stayed with them<br/>right through the night.

490
00:49:57,589 --> 00:50:00,841
By morning, the sheep were drowned.

491
00:50:00,966 --> 00:50:05,928
- And when they found Rex, he was barely alive.<br/>- Oh, Mom!

492
00:50:06,053 --> 00:50:09,389
Two weeks rest in front of the<br/>fire saw him back on his feet.

493
00:50:09,472 --> 00:50:12,391
But his hearing was<br/>never the same again.

494
00:50:12,475 --> 00:50:17,520
He'd never want anyone to know,<br/>but he's almost totally deaf.

495
00:50:17,645 --> 00:50:22,274
- Is that why he's so, you know, angry?<br/>- That's not the half of it.

496
00:50:22,357 --> 00:50:26,152
All this was barely a month before<br/>the Grand National Challenge.

497
00:50:26,277 --> 00:50:30,572
He tried his best, but he couldn't hear<br/>the boss's calls, and it slowed him up.

498
00:50:30,655 --> 00:50:34,283
The cold truth is that, but<br/>for the stupidity of sheep,

499
00:50:34,408 --> 00:50:38,161
Rex would've been the<br/>champion of champions.

500
00:50:42,289 --> 00:50:44,165
Good dog.

501
00:51:10,393 --> 00:51:13,104
That's it, all right. Good.

502
00:51:13,187 --> 00:51:16,523
Here we go. All right.

503
00:51:16,648 --> 00:51:19,608
Now, through here like this.

504
00:51:19,692 --> 00:51:22,152
And then, big hook<br/>to the left. Big hook.

505
00:51:22,235 --> 00:51:26,322
Big hook. Through this gate here.

506
00:51:26,405 --> 00:51:31,284
It was at that time that Mrs. Hoggett<br/>began to worry about her husband.

507
00:51:31,367 --> 00:51:36,246
But Farmer Hoggett knew<br/>that little ideas...

508
00:51:36,371 --> 00:51:39,498
that tickled and nagged<br/>and refused to go away...

509
00:51:39,582 --> 00:51:42,125
should never be ignored...

510
00:51:42,209 --> 00:51:45,837
for in them lie the seeds of destiny.

511
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:49,214
Close the gate like<br/>that, and you're done.

512
00:51:52,216 --> 00:51:55,010
A Tragic Day.

513
00:52:09,438 --> 00:52:14,191
Mom. Mom! Can we start work early today?

514
00:52:14,316 --> 00:52:17,235
Oh, dear, it's not even dawn yet.

515
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:23,198
You can go to work when the<br/>rooster crows. Oh, go back to sleep.

516
00:52:30,245 --> 00:52:32,205
Ahem.

517
00:52:32,288 --> 00:52:35,666
Um, excuse me.

518
00:52:35,749 --> 00:52:39,752
Hello, sir. Excuse me,<br/>but it's nearly dawn, and-

519
00:52:39,877 --> 00:52:43,213
- What?<br/>- Sorry to disturb you.

520
00:52:43,296 --> 00:52:47,466
It's nearly dawn, and I wondered if you'd mind<br/>crowing just a few minutes early this morning.

521
00:52:47,591 --> 00:52:49,468
- Get out of here!<br/>- But, well, see I-

522
00:52:49,593 --> 00:52:52,387
- Get lost!<br/>- Oh, okay.

523
00:52:54,722 --> 00:52:57,640
Whoa!

524
00:53:42,925 --> 00:53:47,386
Now the pig understood why the<br/>sheep called all dogs wolves.

525
00:53:47,470 --> 00:53:51,348
And he was filled with<br/>a deep and terrible rage.

526
00:54:19,994 --> 00:54:21,996
Maa! Maa!

527
00:54:22,121 --> 00:54:25,290
- Are you all right?<br/>- Hello, young'un.

528
00:54:25,373 --> 00:54:27,750
Oh, Maa, can you get up?

529
00:54:27,833 --> 00:54:30,502
I don't reckon.

530
00:54:30,544 --> 00:54:34,964
It's over, Maa. The<br/>wolves have gone far away.

531
00:54:35,047 --> 00:54:38,258
I'll get the boss up<br/>here to look after you.

532
00:54:38,341 --> 00:54:42,261
- You'll be all right.<br/>You'll be all right!

533
00:54:43,470 --> 00:54:47,640
Oh, Maa! Maa!

534
00:54:47,765 --> 00:54:52,810
Maa! Maa!

535
00:54:52,894 --> 00:54:54,854
Maa!

536
00:54:54,979 --> 00:54:59,065
Maa!

537
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:19,122
Home, Pig.

538
00:55:23,292 --> 00:55:26,377
Fly knew that there was only<br/>one fate for any creature...

539
00:55:26,461 --> 00:55:30,130
that took the life of<br/>a sheep on Hoggett Farm.

540
00:55:46,184 --> 00:55:50,729
But Fly could never believe<br/>that Babe was a sheep killer,

541
00:55:50,812 --> 00:55:56,483
so she remained in the field to do<br/>something she'd never talk to the sheep.

542
00:55:56,608 --> 00:55:59,360
Tell me. Who killed the old one?

543
00:55:59,485 --> 00:56:03,197
- Wolf! - Wolf. Is that the<br/>only words you half-wits know?

544
00:56:03,322 --> 00:56:06,199
- Wolf!<br/>- Are you saying it was a dog?

545
00:56:06,324 --> 00:56:09,827
- Where's Babe?<br/>- Was it wolf or Babe?

546
00:56:09,952 --> 00:56:15,122
Wolf! Babe!

547
00:56:17,457 --> 00:56:21,127
Farmer Hoggett was carrying<br/>something in the crook of one arm.

548
00:56:21,210 --> 00:56:23,670
A kind of black, shiny tube.

549
00:56:23,795 --> 00:56:27,131
Come, Pig.

550
00:56:27,215 --> 00:56:31,301
The pig had a vague memory<br/>that shiny tubes produced food,

551
00:56:31,384 --> 00:56:34,637
and guessed that some<br/>quite unexpected surprise...

552
00:56:34,762 --> 00:56:37,931
would come out of two<br/>small round mouths.

553
00:56:38,014 --> 00:56:40,933
Babe! Wolf!

554
00:56:41,017 --> 00:56:44,770
Babe! Wolf!

555
00:56:44,853 --> 00:56:48,064
Quiet!

556
00:56:48,189 --> 00:56:50,524
Fly decided to speak very slowly,

557
00:56:50,649 --> 00:56:54,610
for it was a cold fact of<br/>nature that sheep were stupid...

558
00:56:54,694 --> 00:56:56,653
and no one would ever<br/>persuade her otherwise.

559
00:56:56,779 --> 00:57:00,907
Please, please would you be...

560
00:57:00,990 --> 00:57:04,368
so kind as to tell me what happened?

561
00:57:04,451 --> 00:57:05,744
Quiet!

562
00:57:05,827 --> 00:57:09,580
Please, tell me what<br/>happened this morning.

563
00:57:09,663 --> 00:57:13,750
The sheep spoke very slowly...

564
00:57:13,875 --> 00:57:16,543
for it was a cold fact of nature<br/>that wolves were ignorant...

565
00:57:16,627 --> 00:57:19,087
and nothing would<br/>convince them otherwise.

566
00:57:19,212 --> 00:57:22,631
Babe came! He saved us!

567
00:57:22,756 --> 00:57:27,760
- The wolves killed Maa.<br/>- But Babe drove the wolves away!

568
00:57:27,844 --> 00:57:31,555
Thank you! Thank you!<br/>Thank you all very much!

569
00:57:31,638 --> 00:57:35,599
Pleasure talkin' to ya.

570
00:58:01,619 --> 00:58:06,331
Hooey! Hoggett! Hooey! Arthur!

571
00:58:09,041 --> 00:58:12,627
Oh, there you are!<br/>Well, what do you think?

572
00:58:12,752 --> 00:58:15,796
That was the police on the telephone.<br/>Said there are wild dogs about.

573
00:58:15,921 --> 00:58:18,840
Apparently the Mitchells<br/>lost six lambs this morning.

574
00:58:18,965 --> 00:58:21,300
What are you doing with that gun?

575
00:58:23,177 --> 00:58:26,971
Oh, I<br/>- Nothing.

576
00:58:48,196 --> 00:58:52,449
Pig of Destiny!

577
00:58:58,453 --> 00:59:01,873
It's all very simple. Half<br/>an hour at 350 degrees.

578
00:59:01,998 --> 00:59:05,167
I've given you rabbit<br/>casserole for Friday.

579
00:59:05,292 --> 00:59:08,252
Now, for Duchess, it's liver in<br/>the morning, heart for the evening.

580
00:59:08,377 --> 00:59:11,546
Except Fridays, when it's steak in<br/>the morning, and cooked liver at night.

581
00:59:11,672 --> 00:59:17,718
Warm it up a bit but test it, because she<br/>bites into it before she knows what's what.

582
00:59:17,843 --> 00:59:19,844
That'll be the bus.

583
00:59:25,223 --> 00:59:27,684
- Oh, bye, bye.<br/>- Have a good time. Bye.

584
00:59:27,809 --> 00:59:30,352
Hello, everyone!

585
00:59:36,023 --> 00:59:38,150
Oh, dearie me, Valda.

586
00:59:38,233 --> 00:59:40,401
I know I have to be at<br/>the National Conference.

587
00:59:40,527 --> 00:59:43,696
I am the Assistant General Secretary<br/>of the Northeast Region after all,

588
00:59:43,821 --> 00:59:47,448
but I do worry about<br/>leaving that man alone.

589
00:59:47,574 --> 00:59:51,326
- Still acting a bit strange?<br/>- Just silly things.

590
00:59:51,410 --> 00:59:54,495
Odd little things only<br/>a wife would notice.

591
00:59:54,579 --> 00:59:59,916
- Still, he can't get up to too much mischief in three days.<br/>- Of course not.

592
01:00:12,259 --> 01:00:15,553
Go on.

593
01:00:16,846 --> 01:00:18,388
Go on!

594
01:00:32,566 --> 01:00:36,527
- Oh! Good evening.<br/>Shame about the weather.

595
01:00:36,610 --> 01:00:39,196
Nasty cough!

596
01:00:41,781 --> 01:00:43,991
It had been a long time<br/>since Arthur Hoggett...

597
01:00:44,116 --> 01:00:48,411
had had an animal in whose<br/>abilities he had so much faith.

598
01:00:50,329 --> 01:00:54,290
And with the National Grand Challenge<br/>Sheepdog Trials only two days away,

599
01:00:54,415 --> 01:00:58,043
he wasn't going to let the fact<br/>that his animal was a pig deter him.

600
01:01:00,253 --> 01:01:03,339
He had been worried, for<br/>he was a truthful man,

601
01:01:03,464 --> 01:01:06,466
that the heading might<br/>say "Name of dog. "

602
01:01:06,591 --> 01:01:08,926
And then whatever he put would be a lie.

603
01:01:09,010 --> 01:01:14,264
But as it happened, luck, for<br/>the moment, was running with him.

604
01:01:22,645 --> 01:01:24,605
It's all right, really!

605
01:01:24,730 --> 01:01:28,316
I'm just, well<br/>- Bless you.

606
01:02:16,477 --> 01:02:21,106
Whoa, whoa! Uh, easy, whoa! Ah.

607
01:02:21,189 --> 01:02:23,107
Oh, no.

608
01:02:23,190 --> 01:02:27,319
- So, ah... what's happening?<br/>- Oh, no.

609
01:02:30,863 --> 01:02:32,656
Shh. Easy, easy.

610
01:02:32,739 --> 01:02:35,533
- Good pig. Good pig.<br/>- Huh? Huh?

611
01:02:36,826 --> 01:02:40,120
Hold still. Hold still.

612
01:02:40,203 --> 01:02:44,165
Huh?

613
01:02:47,500 --> 01:02:50,044
There are many perfectly<br/>nice cats in the world.

614
01:02:50,127 --> 01:02:52,713
But every barrel has its bad apples.

615
01:02:52,796 --> 01:02:55,173
And it is well to heed the old adage,

616
01:02:55,298 --> 01:02:59,760
"Beware the bad cat bearing a grudge. "

617
01:04:22,530 --> 01:04:25,449
- How are you feeling?<br/>- A bit tired.

618
01:04:25,532 --> 01:04:28,493
You'll need a good sleep to put<br/>you in top condition tomorrow.

619
01:04:28,618 --> 01:04:30,995
Don't stay up too late. Good night.

620
01:04:31,078 --> 01:04:34,164
Good night, Mom.

621
01:04:42,587 --> 01:04:46,298
Oh, do forgive me for<br/>scratching you, dear.

622
01:04:46,381 --> 01:04:51,135
I got a bit carried<br/>away. It's a cat thing.

623
01:04:51,218 --> 01:04:54,721
Oh. Well-<br/>But oh-

624
01:04:54,846 --> 01:04:58,099
Feeling good about tomorrow, are you?

625
01:04:58,224 --> 01:05:00,726
Mm-hmm. It should be<br/>all right, I think.

626
01:05:00,851 --> 01:05:06,355
I probably shouldn't say this,<br/>but I'm not sure if you realize...

627
01:05:06,438 --> 01:05:11,025
how much the other animals are laughing<br/>at you for this sheepdog business.

628
01:05:11,150 --> 01:05:13,193
Why would they do that?

629
01:05:13,277 --> 01:05:18,155
Well, they say that you've forgotten<br/>that you're a pig. Isn't that silly?

630
01:05:18,239 --> 01:05:21,825
They even say that you<br/>don't know what pigs are for.

631
01:05:21,908 --> 01:05:23,868
What do you mean?

632
01:05:23,951 --> 01:05:28,747
- You know... why pigs are here.<br/>- Why are any of us here?

633
01:05:28,872 --> 01:05:31,540
Well, the cow's here to be milked.

634
01:05:31,665 --> 01:05:34,543
The dogs are here to help the<br/>boss's husband with the sheep.

635
01:05:34,668 --> 01:05:37,837
And I'm here to be beautiful<br/>and affectionate to the boss.

636
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:40,172
Yes?

637
01:05:40,255 --> 01:05:44,675
The fact is that pigs<br/>don't have a purpose.

638
01:05:44,759 --> 01:05:47,678
Just like ducks don't have a purpose.

639
01:05:47,761 --> 01:05:52,389
- I don't- - All right, for<br/>you own sake, I'll be blunt.

640
01:05:52,473 --> 01:05:56,893
Why do the bosses keep<br/>ducks? To eat them.

641
01:05:56,976 --> 01:06:00,354
So why do the bosses keep a pig?

642
01:06:00,437 --> 01:06:06,025
The fact is that animals that don't seem<br/>to have a purpose really do have a purpose.

643
01:06:06,108 --> 01:06:10,611
The bosses have to eat. It's probably<br/>the most noble purpose of all...

644
01:06:10,736 --> 01:06:12,905
when you come to think about it.

645
01:06:12,988 --> 01:06:14,906
They eat pigs?

646
01:06:15,031 --> 01:06:18,659
Pork, they call it. Or bacon.

647
01:06:18,784 --> 01:06:21,453
They only call them<br/>pigs when they're alive.

648
01:06:21,536 --> 01:06:23,871
But, uh, I'm a sheep pig!

649
01:06:25,789 --> 01:06:28,667
The boss's husband's just<br/>playing a little game with you.

650
01:06:28,792 --> 01:06:32,545
Believe me, sooner or<br/>later, every pig gets eaten.

651
01:06:32,628 --> 01:06:36,256
That's the way the world works.

652
01:06:36,381 --> 01:06:41,259
Oh! I haven't upset you, have I?

653
01:07:10,698 --> 01:07:12,950
- Mom?<br/>- Mm-hmm.

654
01:07:13,075 --> 01:07:15,285
- Mom!<br/>- Good heavens!

655
01:07:15,368 --> 01:07:18,954
What on earth are you<br/>doing out in the rain?

656
01:07:19,038 --> 01:07:22,457
You should be looking after yourself<br/>with such a big day ahead of you.

657
01:07:22,582 --> 01:07:25,751
- Are pigs for eatin'?<br/>- Who told you that?

658
01:07:25,835 --> 01:07:29,462
The cat told me. Pigs don't have<br/>a purpose except to be eaten.

659
01:07:29,546 --> 01:07:33,340
Is it true?

660
01:07:33,465 --> 01:07:36,634
It's true. For many pigs, it's true.

661
01:07:36,718 --> 01:07:39,470
So my mother, my father,<br/>my brothers and my sisters,

662
01:07:39,595 --> 01:07:42,764
- all- -<br/>Probably, dear.

663
01:07:45,391 --> 01:07:49,269
- Do you want to talk about it?<br/>- No, it's all right.

664
01:07:50,353 --> 01:07:54,481
I understand. I'll be all right.

665
01:07:57,608 --> 01:08:01,320
Even... the boss?

666
01:08:01,403 --> 01:08:03,988
Yes, dear.

667
01:08:27,131 --> 01:08:30,091
Ooh! Ooo!

668
01:08:30,216 --> 01:08:32,551
Babe?

669
01:08:32,635 --> 01:08:34,178
Babe!

670
01:08:34,261 --> 01:08:36,054
Babe!

671
01:08:40,099 --> 01:08:42,267
Babe!

672
01:08:44,686 --> 01:08:46,020
Babe!

673
01:08:49,231 --> 01:08:51,566
Babe's run away.

674
01:08:51,691 --> 01:08:53,942
Rex?

675
01:08:54,068 --> 01:08:55,735
Please?

676
01:08:55,861 --> 01:08:58,404
Call the boss.

677
01:09:21,630 --> 01:09:23,923
He's over here.

678
01:09:24,007 --> 01:09:27,509
Hold on, Pig. You'll be home soon.

679
01:09:34,473 --> 01:09:38,351
He's got a cold, but that<br/>doesn't explain a pig not eating.

680
01:09:38,476 --> 01:09:41,770
He's got me stonkered, Arthur.<br/>But I can tell you this.

681
01:09:41,853 --> 01:09:46,440
If you don't get fluids into<br/>him soon, you're gonna lose him.

682
01:09:46,524 --> 01:09:51,319
C'mon, son. Pull yourself together.

683
01:09:51,444 --> 01:09:53,863
The boss needs you.

684
01:10:08,915 --> 01:10:11,000
Here we go.

685
01:10:12,335 --> 01:10:15,254
Come on, Pig. Ah, come on.

686
01:10:15,337 --> 01:10:17,464
There's my boy.

687
01:10:17,547 --> 01:10:21,508
Come on, then. Come on.

688
01:12:44,574 --> 01:12:46,742
Listen, Arthur, I'll<br/>tell you what we can do.

689
01:12:46,826 --> 01:12:49,995
You're listed third, but we<br/>can put you last in the program.

690
01:12:50,120 --> 01:12:53,664
However, you must be here by 3:30;<br/>otherwise you'll be disqualified.

691
01:12:53,789 --> 01:12:55,749
All right.

692
01:13:12,137 --> 01:13:16,098
And welcome back to the National<br/>Grand Challenge Sheepdog Trials...

693
01:13:16,223 --> 01:13:19,600
coming today from the Kingsmith Show<br/>Ground in the heart of sheep country.

694
01:13:19,726 --> 01:13:22,186
The weather's been patchy,

695
01:13:22,311 --> 01:13:26,856
but we've already seen some<br/>wonderful work by these talented dogs.

696
01:13:38,031 --> 01:13:39,991
Stay there.

697
01:13:40,074 --> 01:13:42,201
Excuse me, sheep.

698
01:13:42,326 --> 01:13:45,995
Hello! Hello! Good morning to you all!

699
01:13:48,539 --> 01:13:52,000
I've never met a sheep with<br/>such a strong, dark face.

700
01:13:52,083 --> 01:13:55,628
Are they feeding you well?

701
01:13:55,711 --> 01:13:57,337
Babe, I'll try.

702
01:13:57,421 --> 01:14:01,715
All right, blockheads!<br/>Pay attention over here!

703
01:14:01,841 --> 01:14:06,261
Now, you pay attention to<br/>what this pig has to say...

704
01:14:06,386 --> 01:14:11,014
or I'll come in there<br/>and rip you to shreds!

705
01:14:11,139 --> 01:14:15,559
Hadn't thought of this. Keep talking<br/>to them. I'll see what I can do.

706
01:14:20,313 --> 01:14:24,649
- Doesn't it look a picture? Our show ground on the telly!<br/>- Apart from the weather.

707
01:14:24,733 --> 01:14:29,069
- Look! There's your Bert!<br/>- Bert Ford and Sweep doing very well.

708
01:14:29,194 --> 01:14:34,198
- Sweep's having a little trouble with this gate, Clive.<br/>- A lot of trouble actually.

709
01:14:34,323 --> 01:14:38,785
- That's going to set Bert back.<br/>- Don't worry, Valda. Just a little slipup.

710
01:14:38,910 --> 01:14:41,579
Look, he's doing much better now.

711
01:14:41,704 --> 01:14:45,707
Too many loose sheep. And Sweep's<br/>usually such a reliable dog.

712
01:14:50,627 --> 01:14:52,879
Hey, whoa. Stop!

713
01:15:04,137 --> 01:15:07,807
If those sheep won't talk to Babe, the<br/>boss is going to look like an idiot.

714
01:15:07,932 --> 01:15:10,934
- I don't know what to do.<br/>- There is one thing.

715
01:15:11,059 --> 01:15:15,062
I gotta go! I'll try to be back in time.

716
01:15:21,442 --> 01:15:25,945
Ahem. It must've been<br/>terrible weather for you,

717
01:15:26,070 --> 01:15:31,116
- out in the field with all<br/>this rain we've been having.

718
01:15:34,785 --> 01:15:36,870
Hey, that dog's in a hurry.

719
01:15:36,954 --> 01:15:40,373
Come on, Nick, I got a<br/>beer and a TV waiting.

720
01:15:51,131 --> 01:15:55,676
The last entry is<br/>Pig. Owner, A. Hoggett.

721
01:15:55,801 --> 01:15:57,969
- Was that "Hoggett"?<br/>- I think it was!

722
01:15:58,095 --> 01:16:03,015
- Huh?<br/>- He said Hoggett. It was clear as a bell.

723
01:16:03,140 --> 01:16:07,018
Must be another Hoggett. We only have<br/>the two dogs, and they certainly...

724
01:16:07,143 --> 01:16:09,019
aren't-

725
01:16:20,611 --> 01:16:23,405
Wolf! Wolf!

726
01:16:23,489 --> 01:16:25,490
Wolf! Wolf!

727
01:16:25,615 --> 01:16:29,201
Shut up, you morons!

728
01:16:29,326 --> 01:16:31,286
The little pig's in trouble.

729
01:16:31,411 --> 01:16:34,789
What trouble has come to our Babe, wolf?

730
01:16:34,914 --> 01:16:37,708
The sheep at the trials won't<br/>talk to the little fellow.

731
01:16:37,833 --> 01:16:39,959
They won't listen. He<br/>doesn't know what to do.

732
01:16:40,084 --> 01:16:43,212
Don't know what we could do to help.

733
01:16:43,337 --> 01:16:47,131
- It's not right to give help to a wolf.<br/>- You wait here, wolf.

734
01:16:47,257 --> 01:16:52,010
You'll have to speak up. I'm<br/>a... little hard of hearing.

735
01:16:52,135 --> 01:16:56,013
I asked you to wait here, wolf.

736
01:16:56,138 --> 01:16:58,849
Do what you're told by<br/>an old sheep for a change.

737
01:16:58,974 --> 01:17:01,684
We'll see what we can do for you.

738
01:17:02,977 --> 01:17:06,563
Work completed. Restore power.

739
01:17:06,688 --> 01:17:10,149
Very frustrating to<br/>be sitting up here...

740
01:17:10,274 --> 01:17:12,359
wondering what's causing the delay.

741
01:17:12,484 --> 01:17:15,695
We have someone on their<br/>way to the judges' rooms now.

742
01:17:15,820 --> 01:17:18,488
We'll tell you what's causing the<br/>problem as soon as we find out.

743
01:17:18,613 --> 01:17:21,157
- Perhaps it's a drug test?<br/>- Yeah, it could be.

744
01:17:21,282 --> 01:17:24,076
- I've never heard of a drug<br/>test at a sheepdog contest before.

745
01:17:24,201 --> 01:17:29,538
We've got somethin' here that<br/>might be of use to our pig.

746
01:17:29,622 --> 01:17:31,665
Password! Password!

747
01:17:31,748 --> 01:17:34,208
Before we gives you anythin',

748
01:17:34,334 --> 01:17:38,295
- you'll be makin' us a solemn promise.<br/>- Yes?

749
01:17:38,378 --> 01:17:42,048
- Treat us civil! - Yes!<br/>You gotta treat us nice-like.

750
01:17:42,173 --> 01:17:44,675
I'll try.

751
01:17:44,758 --> 01:17:48,177
- No bitin'!<br/>- That's right. Wolf must avoid bitin' us sheep...

752
01:17:48,302 --> 01:17:51,888
- at all costs!<br/>- All right! I'll try that too.

753
01:17:52,014 --> 01:17:56,058
It's preposterous! We'd be the laughingstock<br/>of every sheepdog organization...

754
01:17:56,183 --> 01:17:58,977
- in every civilized country<br/>in the world! - There's no rule-

755
01:17:59,060 --> 01:18:02,813
We'll see about that when the adjudication<br/>committee have finished their meeting.

756
01:18:02,897 --> 01:18:08,317
What will we have next year, a<br/>laughing hyena doing show jumping?

757
01:18:08,401 --> 01:18:11,737
But the most important of<br/>all, you must promise...

758
01:18:11,862 --> 01:18:15,531
never ever to let this<br/>password we be about to give...

759
01:18:15,615 --> 01:18:17,866
to be used against any sheep anywhere.

760
01:18:17,950 --> 01:18:20,452
I promise you that. I'll make<br/>sure the pig knows it too.

761
01:18:20,577 --> 01:18:24,121
- We have the promise!<br/>- 'Tis for Babe.

762
01:18:24,246 --> 01:18:26,790
Maa would have wanted it.

763
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,878
Baa, ram, ewe.

764
01:18:32,961 --> 01:18:35,713
Baa, ram, ewe.

765
01:18:35,838 --> 01:18:39,925
To your breed, your<br/>fleece, your clan be true.

766
01:18:40,050 --> 01:18:45,012
Sheep be true. Baa, ram, ewe.

767
01:18:45,095 --> 01:18:49,390
Is that it? Is that the password?

768
01:19:04,443 --> 01:19:07,487
Mr. Hoggett, the judges would<br/>like me to convey to you...

769
01:19:07,612 --> 01:19:11,073
their disappointment that<br/>a man such as yourself,

770
01:19:11,198 --> 01:19:15,576
with a long and honorable association with<br/>the work of National Sheepdog Association,

771
01:19:15,701 --> 01:19:18,579
should see fit to flout...

772
01:19:18,662 --> 01:19:22,873
the historic conventions which<br/>have long ruled our sport.

773
01:19:22,957 --> 01:19:26,168
However we find there<br/>is no rule, as such,

774
01:19:26,293 --> 01:19:31,130
which would prevent your...<br/>animal... being entered.

775
01:19:45,349 --> 01:19:48,309
The committee has ruled<br/>that if you wish to proceed,

776
01:19:48,434 --> 01:19:51,311
there is nothing we can do to stop you.

777
01:19:51,437 --> 01:19:54,689
What do you wish to do?

778
01:20:01,986 --> 01:20:05,405
There appears to be some<br/>movement down there now.

779
01:20:05,489 --> 01:20:07,949
I expect if there are<br/>no further problems,

780
01:20:08,074 --> 01:20:11,785
we shall see Hoggett and his dog Pig.

781
01:20:11,910 --> 01:20:14,746
- Unusual name. Strange name, isn't it?<br/>- Pig.

782
01:20:14,829 --> 01:20:16,956
Anyone for a game of cards?

783
01:20:17,081 --> 01:20:19,791
Oh, good grief! Look!

784
01:20:36,846 --> 01:20:39,973
He's a fool!

785
01:20:40,056 --> 01:20:44,768
Entry number 23, Mr.<br/>A. Hoggett with Pig.

786
01:21:11,538 --> 01:21:15,041
This is just too crazy to believe.

787
01:21:15,166 --> 01:21:18,002
And if that isn't enough. We<br/>have a stray dog on the field.

788
01:21:18,127 --> 01:21:20,378
They trying to round him up?

789
01:21:20,504 --> 01:21:24,924
The dog's gonna give a few<br/>tips on how to be a sheep pig.

790
01:21:38,058 --> 01:21:41,853
Well, it's up to him now.

791
01:21:57,114 --> 01:21:59,783
Away to me, Pig.

792
01:22:06,997 --> 01:22:11,125
Get off!

793
01:22:15,128 --> 01:22:18,005
Baa, ram, ewe. Baa, ram, ewe!

794
01:22:18,088 --> 01:22:22,217
To your breed, your<br/>fleece, your clan be true.

795
01:22:22,342 --> 01:22:25,427
Sheep be true. Baa, ram, ewe.

796
01:22:25,552 --> 01:22:29,305
What... what did you say?

797
01:22:29,430 --> 01:22:33,141
Get yourself a dog, Hoggett.

798
01:22:39,188 --> 01:22:43,399
There, there, Esme. It's<br/>not the end of the world.

799
01:22:43,524 --> 01:22:47,652
Is he just going to stand<br/>there until his time runs out?

800
01:22:47,777 --> 01:22:49,696
Or could this be some sort of protest?

801
01:22:49,779 --> 01:22:52,906
Maybe we should line up an<br/>interview with the sheep pig?

802
01:22:53,031 --> 01:22:55,492
Or the sheep pig's trainer.

803
01:22:55,617 --> 01:22:57,910
He's a lively sort of fellow<br/>by the looks of things.

804
01:22:57,993 --> 01:23:00,787
Good heavens!

805
01:23:23,221 --> 01:23:26,098
- Hey!<br/>- Shh.

806
01:23:26,223 --> 01:23:28,933
It's Babe!

807
01:23:39,566 --> 01:23:41,276
I-<br/>I-

808
01:23:41,401 --> 01:23:44,111
- It,<br/>uh- - Hmm.

809
01:23:49,949 --> 01:23:53,535
Oh, beautifully done! I can't tell<br/>you how grateful I am to y'all.

810
01:23:53,660 --> 01:23:55,787
Now, for one last favor.

811
01:23:55,912 --> 01:23:59,123
If the three ladies with collars<br/>would kindly walk out of the ring,

812
01:23:59,248 --> 01:24:01,291
I'd be very much obliged.

813
01:25:49,164 --> 01:25:51,916
And so it was that in<br/>all the celebration,

814
01:25:52,041 --> 01:25:54,876
in all the hubbub of<br/>noise and excitement,

815
01:25:54,960 --> 01:25:58,421
there were two figures who<br/>stood silent and still...

816
01:25:58,546 --> 01:26:01,506
side by side.

817
01:26:03,258 --> 01:26:06,385
The pig did it! The perfect score!

818
01:26:08,637 --> 01:26:10,555
Yippee! Yippee!

819
01:26:10,638 --> 01:26:15,517
And though every single human in the<br/>stands or in the commentary boxes...

820
01:26:15,600 --> 01:26:19,186
was at a complete loss for words,

821
01:26:19,270 --> 01:26:23,064
the man, who in his life had uttered<br/>fewer words than any of them...

822
01:26:23,189 --> 01:26:26,984
knew exactly what to say.

823
01:26:27,109 --> 01:26:29,277
That'll do, Pig.

824
01:26:33,447 --> 01:26:35,449
That'll do.

825
01:26:48,500 --> 01:26:52,253
And a-one and a-two<br/>and a-three. Hit it.
