885
00:42:56,275 --> 00:42:59,009
This workshop is not
a government-led program.

886
00:42:59,011 --> 00:43:02,546
It's a private institution that turns
reclamation projects like yourself...

887
00:43:02,548 --> 00:43:06,083
into men of
extraordinary abilities.

888
00:43:07,553 --> 00:43:11,021
But if you think super-human
powers are acquired painlessly...

889
00:43:11,891 --> 00:43:13,290
Wrong.
(GROANS)

890
00:43:13,292 --> 00:43:14,959
I'm injecting you
with a serum...

891
00:43:14,961 --> 00:43:17,561
that activates any mutant
genes lurking in your DNA.

892
00:43:17,563 --> 00:43:21,565
For it to work we need to
subject you to extreme stress.

break some eggs" bit, right?

00:43:31,110 --> 00:43:33,577
I'm about to hurt you, Wade.

896
00:43:33,579 --> 00:43:36,647
I was a patient here once
myself, you know.

897
00:43:36,649 --> 00:43:39,516
The treatment affects
everyone differently.

898
00:43:39,518 --> 00:43:42,653
It made Angel
inhumanly strong.

899
00:43:42,655 --> 00:43:47,258
In my case,
it enhanced my reflexes.

900
00:43:47,260 --> 00:43:50,294
Also scorched my nerve endings,
so I no longer feel pain.

901
00:43:51,998 --> 00:43:55,933
And, in fact,
I no longer feel anything.

You have something
in your teeth.

905
00:44:10,082 --> 00:44:12,283
Right in the middle there.
Just, I don't...

906
00:44:12,285 --> 00:44:15,386
A little nugget of romaine
lettuce or something.

Hey, is Ajax
your actual name?

912
00:44:24,163 --> 00:44:25,996
Because it sounds
suspiciously made up.

913
00:44:25,998 --> 00:44:27,131
What is it, really?

914
00:44:27,133 --> 00:44:29,400

915
00:44:29,402 --> 00:44:31,702
Mitch? The Rickster?

916
00:44:31,704 --> 00:44:33,570
(in British accent)
Is it Basil Fawlty?

917

survives this place

919

978

is that you can't really
step it up from there.

nothing will.

982

00:47:42,944 --> 00:47:44,460
lower the oxygen
concentration in the air...

00:47:44,463 --> 00:47:47,364
to the exact point you feel
like you're suffocating.

If your brainwaves slow,

986
00:47:48,634 --> 00:47:51,235
meaning you're
about to pass out...

987
00:47:51,237 --> 00:47:52,436
then we'll turn up the O2.

to catch your breath...

1759
01:34:50,186 --> 01:34:51,252
To?

1760
01:34:52,155 --> 01:34:53,487
Be a hero.

1762
01:34:55,525 --> 01:34:58,426
Everyone thinks
it's a full-time job.

1763
01:34:58,428 --> 01:35:00,728
Wake up a hero,
brush your teeth a hero,

1764
01:35:00,730 --> 01:35:02,163
go to work a hero.

1765
01:35:02,498 --> 01:35:04,398
Not true.

1766
01:35:04,400 --> 01:35:07,601
Over a lifetime, there are
only four or five moments

1767
01:35:07,603 --> 01:35:10,237
that really matter.

1768
01:35:10,239 --> 01:35:12,673
Moments when you're
offered a choice.

1769
01:35:12,675 --> 01:35:15,443
To make a sacrifice,
conquer a flaw,

1770
01:35:15,445 --> 01:35:17,078
save a friend...

1771
01:35:17,513 --> 01:35:20,681
spare an enemy.

1772
01:35:20,683 --> 01:35:22,249
In these moments...

1773
01:35:23,019 --> 01:35:26,420
everything else falls away.

1774
01:35:26,422 --> 01:35:29,423
The way the world sees us.

1775
01:35:29,425 --> 01:35:30,491
The way we...

1777
01:35:34,630 --> 01:35:35,763
Why?

1778
01:35:37,033 --> 01:35:39,100
You were droning on.

1779
01:35:39,102 --> 01:35:42,169
Sure, I may be stuck looking
like pepperoni flatbread...

1780
01:35:42,171 --> 01:35:45,206
but at least fuckface
won't heal from that.

1781
01:35:45,208 --> 01:35:48,275
If wearing superhero tights...

1782
01:35:48,277 --> 01:35:49,677
means sparing psychopaths...

1783
01:35:49,679 --> 01:35:52,046
then maybe I wasn't
meant to wear 'em.

1784
01:35:52,048 --> 01:35:54,382
Not everyone monitors
a hall like you.

1785
01:35:54,384 --> 01:35:55,483
Just promise...

1786
01:35:55,485 --> 01:35:57,218
Yeah, yeah,
I'll be on the lookout

1787
01:35:57,220 --> 01:35:59,453
for the next four moments.

1788
01:35:59,455 --> 01:36:01,188
(WHISPERS) Oh, shit.

1789
01:36:01,190 --> 01:36:04,792
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm just a boy,

1790
01:36:04,794 --> 01:36:07,194
about to stand
in front of a girl...

1791
01:36:07,196 --> 01:36:08,496
and tell her...

1792
01:36:08,498 --> 01:36:10,564
What the fuck
am I gonna tell her?

1793
01:36:10,566 --> 01:36:14,035
Well, hmm,
you better figure it out.

1794
01:36:15,371 --> 01:36:16,637
I can't even tell you...
(GRUNTS)

1795
01:36:16,639 --> 01:36:18,506
I deserved that.
That, too.

1796
01:36:18,508 --> 01:36:20,274
No, no, no,
maybe not the nethers.

1797
01:36:20,276 --> 01:36:22,243
Start talking!

1798
01:36:24,213 --> 01:36:26,080
I'm sorry.

1799
01:36:26,082 --> 01:36:28,315
I'm so sorry.

1800
01:36:28,317 --> 01:36:30,818
(STUTTERS) For everything,
I'm sorry for leaving...

1801
01:36:32,355 --> 01:36:34,455
I'm sorry for not
cowboying up sooner.

1802
01:36:34,457 --> 01:36:36,290
It's been rough
couple of years.

1803
01:36:36,292 --> 01:36:37,358
Rough?

1804
01:36:45,134 --> 01:36:47,068
I live in a crackhouse.

1805
01:36:48,204 --> 01:36:49,537
With a family of 12.

1806
01:36:51,274 --> 01:36:52,740
Every night
we spoon for warmth.

1807
01:36:52,742 --> 01:36:55,810
Everybody fights for Noelle.
She's the fattest.

1808
01:36:55,812 --> 01:36:57,578
There's nothing
that we don't share.

1809
01:36:57,580 --> 01:37:01,782
Floor space, dental floss,
even condoms.

1810
01:37:09,792 --> 01:37:12,193
So, you live in a house.

1811
01:37:20,803 --> 01:37:23,838
I should have come
and found you sooner.

1812
01:37:25,341 --> 01:37:26,674
But, baby,
the guy under this mask,

1813
01:37:26,676 --> 01:37:29,376
he ain't the same one
that you remember.

1814
01:37:33,616 --> 01:37:34,849
You mean this mask?

1815
01:37:54,904 --> 01:37:56,637
And this one.

1816
01:37:58,141 --> 01:37:59,840
In case the other fell off.

1817
01:38:02,745 --> 01:38:05,212
All right.
Yeah, just... Ow.

1818
01:38:05,214 --> 01:38:06,814

just give it a...

1819

Owdie 5,000.

1820
01:38:09,152 --> 01:38:10,284
Wait, wait, wait...

1821
01:38:12,155 --> 01:38:13,420
Are you sure?

1822
01:38:15,258 --> 01:38:16,323
I'm sure.

1823
01:38:26,536 --> 01:38:27,601
Wow.

01:38:28,838 --> 01:38:30,204
Yeah.

adjustment period...

1827
01:38:42,785 --> 01:38:44,785
and a bunch of drinks...

1828
01:38:46,255 --> 01:38:48,289
it's a face...

1829
01:38:52,595 --> 01:38:54,361
I'd be happy to sit on.

1830
01:39:01,671 --> 01:39:05,306
I'm not the same
underneath this suit, either.

1831

No.

I've all been waiting for.
