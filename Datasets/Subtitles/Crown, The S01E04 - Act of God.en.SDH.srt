-Fuel on.
-[Philip] Fuel on.

3
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:32,160
Chocks are in position. Switches are off.

4
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,080
You sure about this, sir?

5
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:38,040
When I got married, my in-laws made me
marshal of the Royal Air Force,

6
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:43,720
as a result, I'm the most senior airman in
the country and I can't bloody well fly.

7
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,680
-Yes, I'm sure.
-Right-o, sir.

8
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,560
-[Townsend] Ready, sir?
-Ready!

9
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,200
[Townsend] Here we go. Whoa!

10
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,160
[Philip] Okay.

11
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,480
[Philip whoops]

12
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,160
[Philip] Blimey!

13
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,400
[Philip] Christ!

14
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,960
-[Townsend] All right there, sir?
-[Philip] Yes, yes, fine.

15
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,120
-Now it's your turn. You have control.
-[Philip] I have control.

16
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,080
[Townsend] Now remember what I told you,
keep your eye on the altimeter

17
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,920
and the compass heading
and keep the stick level.

18
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,080
[Townsend] That's very good.
That's balanced.

19
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:14,240
[Townsend] Stick to the left,
then to the right.

20
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:23,760
-[Townsend] And level. Good.
-Noisy, isn't it?

21
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,400
[engine stops]

22
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,200
[Townsend] How's this, sir?

23
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,680
[Philip] My God.

24
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,120
-[Townsend] Isn't it wonderful?
-Heaven.

25
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,080
[Philip] You fought in
the Battle of Britain, didn't you?

26
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,160
[Townsend] I did, sir.
Two-five-seven squadron.

27
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:00,320
-[Philip] Flying what? Spitfires?
-Hurricanes, mostly, sir.

28
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,080
-Any kills?
-One or two.

29
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:07,840
[Philip] Shouldn't we get her started now?
The ground seems terribly close.

30
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:12,120
[Townsend] No, it's too low to restart,
sir. We'll do a dead-stick landing.

31
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,360
-I have control.
-[Philip] You have control.

32
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,440
That was wonderful.

33
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:37,440
-Same time next week, sir?
-How about tomorrow?

34
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,800
[distant traffic noises]

35
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,240
[quiet chatter]

36
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,720
-Latest charts.
-Thank you.

37
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,800
[man] Thank you, sir.

38
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,960
Johnson, what do you think of this?

39
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,640
Interesting.

40
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,920
Sir?

41
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,600
[Johnson] I think you should see these.

42
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,280
I see.

43
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,840
Sir.

44
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,280
Goodness me.

45
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:09,400
[woman] Excuse me, you can't go
in there. Excuse me, sir.

46
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,640
Sorry, sir. Thought you should see these.

47
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,040
Good God.

48
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,600
We must send a warning.

49
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,120
To cover our backs.

50
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:31,600
Kenneth, it should probably come from you,
as chief scientist.

51
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,520
Address it to the PM.
He'll never read it, of course.

52
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,600
But the important thing is we sent it.

53
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,400
I'll get it to Downing Street right away.

54
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,760
[policeman] Wait there, please.

55
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:12,160
If Her Majesty could lean forward.

56
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,120
And deep breath in...

57
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,600
[wheezing]

58
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,840
...and out.

59
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,360
The air's a little stuffy, ma'am. It
might help to open the window a crack?

60
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,560
Not while they're rehearsing.

61
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,080
What are they rehearsing?

62
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,560
My funeral.

63
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,800
[typewriters clack]

64
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,800
[indistinct conversations]

65
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,160
Oh, there you are. Miss Scott.

66
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
[noisy conversation]

67
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,440
-Mr. Thurman.
-Mr. Collins.

68
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,280
-This is for you.
-Thank you.

69
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:01,160
I'm not a scientist.
I can't say I understand it.

70
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:06,400
But, what I can tell you is we don't get
a weather warning like this every day.

71
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,600
We don't get one every month, either.

72
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:12,400
In fact, I've never heard of us
getting one at all.

73
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:18,120
Does the name Donora mean anything to you?

74
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,880
Donora?

75
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:27,080
Oh, of course I remember Donora.
It was a scandal.

76
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,880
A small mill town in America,
outside Philadelphia?

77
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,280
Pittsburgh.

78
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:36,280
They had a smog
brought on by a freak anti-cyclone

79
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:39,600
which trapped the emissions
from the local copper work...

80
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,880
-Zinc.
-...in the fog.

81
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:45,600
-In a few days a number of people died.
-Twenty.

82
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:51,320
And several thousand became
seriously ill from the poisonous fog.

83
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:55,160
After the incident a cross-party
delegation was sent to Donora

84
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,080
on an urgent fact-finding mission.

85
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:00,200
They recommended that clean air zones
be set up all round London,

86
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,080
as a precautionary measure.

87
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:07,520
-I never saw the report.
-With good reason.

88
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,320
Our Prime Minister threw it away,
claiming it wasn't a priority.

89
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,560
-Can you prove that?
-I can, Mr. Atlee.

90
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:26,320
The Cabinet minutes
where it was discussed.

91
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:37,120
He's insisted the country keep
burning coal irresponsibly this winter,

92
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,440
to give the illusion of a solid economy.

93
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:46,600
-This is great, Clem.
-It's interesting, for sure.

94
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,520
What I don't understand is this.

95
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:57,080
Why a Downing Street employee,
working for the government,

96
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:59,760
should come to me with this information?

97
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:03,440
I've read the<i> Aeneid,</i> Mr. Thurman.

98
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:06,120
"Do not trust the horse, Trojans.

99
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:09,640
I fear the Greeks
even when they bring gifts."

100
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:14,480
Mr. Atlee, I entered the civil service
to serve the public

101
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,480
and to serve government, any government.

102
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,120
But I am also a responsible citizen

103
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,600
and I cannot stand by
while chaos reigns around me.

104
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,240
This is not a government.

105
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:33,720
Mr. Attlee, this is a collection
of hesitant, frightened, old men

106
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:39,320
unable to unseat a tyrannical,
delusional even older one.

107
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:42,920
Yours was the most radical,

108
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,200
forward-thinking government
this country has ever seen.

109
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:52,280
How you lost the election escapes me.

110
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,840
Escapes us all.

111
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:02,000
I believe I would be doing the British
public and this country a service

112
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:07,320
if I helped to usher him out of
the door, and you back in.

113
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:12,560
And to that end you come to me
with a "master plan"

114
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:17,720
that involves me crucifying the Tories
for their failure to deal with a fog

115
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,080
which as yet shows no sign of appearing.

116
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:25,800
At present I can see stars.

117
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,400
[choral music]

118
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,600
-[man] Good night.
-[Venetia] Good night.

119
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,200
[Churchill] Miss Scott.

120
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,880
Thank you for your conscientiousness,
but it's late.

121
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,240
-Go home.
-I am, sir.

122
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,920
You're no good to me tired.
Good evening to you.

123
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,200
-Scott, still here?
-Good night, sir.

124
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,200
[Venetia] Good night.

125
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,560
-[Venetia] Evening, Pat.
-[chuckles]

126
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,360
[Mary] You haven't moved.

127
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,960
I suppose it's still a "no"?

128
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:34,120
-To what?
-Coming out.

129
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:37,640
Oh, you mean going to the Lamb and Flag
with you, sitting at the bar,

130
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:41,680
twinkling our ankles at every
unremarkable young man in the room.

131
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:45,080
Then letting those men buy us drinks
for us to bring them home,

132
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:49,240
only to have their unremarkability
confirmed to us again?

133
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:52,640
No, thanks.

134
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:56,280
Goodness. And what will you be doing
in the meantime?

135
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:00,040
Spend time in the company
of someone remarkable.

136
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,320

It's been judged too hazardous, ma'am.

I have an appointment
to see my grandmother.

Might it be possible for you
to pretend that you haven't?

-Ma'am?

-Queen Elizabeth, ma'am.

171
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:16,120
-Which one? There are two.
-The young one.

172
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,400
Oh, the Queen.

173
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,360
I thought you was all queens.
They gave me a sheet.

174
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,960
We are.

175
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:26,880
I was the queen so long as my husband
the king was alive, but since he died,

176
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,560
I am no longer the queen,
I am simply Queen Mary.

177
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:35,600
My late son's widow was also the queen,
but upon the death of her husband,

178
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:38,480
she became Queen Elizabeth,
the Queen Mother.

179
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:42,720
Her daughter, Queen Elizabeth,
is now queen, so she is...

180
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:46,240
-The Queen.
-Bravo.

181
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,120
Nurses and nuns have the same problem.

182
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:53,680
-We're all called Sister.
-So you are.

183
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:57,760
Well, she's outside. The Queen.

184
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,520
Then let her in. Sister.

185
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,960
-Bad time?
-Not at all.

186
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,880
-How are you?
-I'm always happy to see you,

187
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,080
and my mood will improve yet further
if you promise me one thing.

188
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,680
-Name it.
-Not to ask me how I am.

189
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,400
It's all anyone ever does.

190
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:33,200
Forget death by lung disease,
it's death by bad conversation.

191
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,080
All right. I promise.

192
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,840
But if you are feeling up to it,

193
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:39,640
there was something
I wanted to talk to you about.

194
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,840
Fire away.

195
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,240
I was listening
to the wireless this morning,

196
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:57,480
where they described this fog
as an act of God.

197
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,920
Now, in your letter that you sent me,

198
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,840
you said...

199
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:13,840
"Loyalty to the ideal you have inherited
is your duty above everything else,

200
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:17,640
because the calling comes
from the highest source.

201
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,240
From God himself."

202
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,640
Yes.

203
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,080
Do you really believe that?

204
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:31,280
Monarchy is God's sacred mission
to grace and dignify the earth.

205
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:34,480
To give ordinary people
an ideal to strive towards,

206
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:39,480
an example of nobility and duty
to raise them in their wretched lives.

207
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:44,080
Monarchy is a calling from God.

208
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:47,160
That is why you are crowned in an abbey,
not a government building.

209
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,240
Why you are anointed, not appointed.

210
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:52,040
It's an archbishop
that puts the crown on your head,

211
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:54,560
not a minister or public servant.

212
00:20:54,640 --> 00:21:00,800
Which means that you are answerable
to God in your duty, not the public.

213
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:05,040
I'm not sure that my husband
would agree with that.

214
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:09,280
He would argue
that in any equitable modern society,

215
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,920
that church and state
should be separated.

216
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,440
That if God has servants
they're priests not kings.

217
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:20,720
He would also say that he watched
his own family destroyed,

218
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:23,480
because they were seen by the people
to embody indefensible

219
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:25,440
and unreasonable ideas.

220
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:29,600
Yes, but he represents a royal family
of carpetbaggers and parvenus,

221
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:33,040
that goes back what? Ninety years?

222
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:37,280
What would he know of Alfred the Great,
the Rod of Equity and Mercy,

223
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,040
Edward the Confessor,

224
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,480
William the Conqueror
or Henry the Eighth?

225
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:46,600
It's the Church of England, dear,
not the Church of Denmark or Greece.

226
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,880
Next question.

227
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:58,280
[Collins] It's chaos out there. Trains
disrupted, air services cancelled.

228
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,960
At Richmond Bridge this morning,

229
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:03,120
visibility was officially measured
at one yard.

230
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,360
That's a record low, incidentally.

231
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,920
Our Trojan friend in Downing Street
has been speaking

232
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,160
to his friends at the Met office.

233
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:15,560
They say this is just the beginning.
They expect it to get worse.

234
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:18,800
I know you would have me call
a vote of no confidence,

235
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,840
and will doubtless call me
over-cautious for not doing so.

236
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:26,440
But the Prime Minister
needs to be given a chance.

237
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,320
Even if it's only to hang himself.

238
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,600
Let's see how the old fool responds.

239
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:40,360
[pedestrians cough]

240
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:48,280
-[horse whickers]
-[man] There you go. There you go.

241
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,400
[man 2] Hey! Get out the way!

242
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,200
[chesty coughing]

243
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:10,560
[Venetia] Morning.

244
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:22,640
Oh. I'm glad to see someone else made it
in. No one saw this coming, did they?

245
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,000
No.

246
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:34,280
Prime Minister? Sir?

247
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:56,200
-Ah, you made it? Bravo!
-Oh, I'm so sorry, sir.

248
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:58,360
-I was just--
-No, no. You did well to get here.

249
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:01,760
I gather
half the Downing Street staff didn't?

250
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:06,120
It wasn't easy. Just crossing the road
you take your life in your hands.

251
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,440
Well, then don't.
You are too important to all of us.

252
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,200
Hardly.

253
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:13,560
All I do is bring you things to sign.
Then take them away again.

254
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:18,000
And so the wheels keep turning,
and the business gets done,

255
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,080
and the country is governed.

256
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:27,080
But what's my personal contribution?

257
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:33,480
You improve the quality of life
for all that deal with you.

258
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:37,680
An ornament. A flower.

259
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:43,400
By comparison at my age
you were a published writer,

260
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:46,240
and a cavalry officer, posted to India,

261
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,960
fighting local tribesmen
on the north west frontier.

262
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,160
Who told you that?

263
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:54,560
You asked me to engage in a relationship
with a young man, my own age.

264
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,000
So I have been reading
your autobiography.

265
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:00,600
[chuckles] Oh, yes.
That's not quite what I had in mind.

266
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:05,360
"Hear this, young men and women
everywhere, and proclaim it far and wide.

267
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:09,880
The earth is yours
and the fullness thereof.

268
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,800
Be kind but be fierce.

269
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:17,760
You are needed now
more than ever before.

270
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,400
-Take up the mantle of change...
-Stop.

271
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,960
...for this is your time."

272
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,160
You were 24.

273
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:37,400
All energy and hope
and passion and fire.

274
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,440
It's remarkable.

275
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:48,080
You found something you liked
in that young man?

276
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,160
I did.

277
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:03,040
[alarm clock rings]

278
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,880
[reporter]<i> Good morning.</i>

292
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,600
[coughing]

293
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:20,560
Are you all right?

294
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:23,920
You're not.

295
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:29,800
-Come on, let's get you up.
-No, no. I'm fine. I promise.

296
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:37,600
It's just because the window was open.
Now go to work. You've got a job to do.

297
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:49,800
Let us start with the unrest in Egypt,

298
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:53,160
where anti-colonial passions
continue to run high,

299
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:58,120
and where our soldiers continue to come
under fire from nationalist insurgents.

300
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:04,280
It is vital that we remain
and successfully defend the Suez Canal,

301
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:08,440
a point that I will be making in person
to the Commonwealth Heads,

302
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:12,560
when I host them
for the weekend at Chequers.

303
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,880
[Elizabeth] Weather permitting.

304
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,000
Indeed.

305
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,480
What is the latest information
that you have?

306
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:25,040
About the weather?
It's fog, ma'am. It will lift eventually.

307
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,440
I was hoping
for something more scientific.

308
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:31,680
Then I will ensure
that a barometric report

309
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,960
is included in your box tomorrow,

310
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:39,400
complete with isobars and isohumes.

311
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:42,400
It has been an unusually cold winter,

312
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:46,120
and there are only so many things
that I, as Prime Minister,

313
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:50,320
am prepared to inflict on your subjects
as a reward for winning a World War

314
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:54,800
and prevailing over fascism,
evil and tyranny.

315
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,720
Letting them freeze is not one of them.

316
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:01,200
-You do not seem unduly concerned.
-I'm not.

317
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:07,160
You do know that my late father wrote,
many years ago, to your predecessors,

318
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:10,080
to express his deep concern
about the inner city power stations

319
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,640
that your party was building.

320
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:15,960
Indeed.

321
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:22,640
And I was sympathetic
with your father's concerns at the time.

322
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:27,080
I also have sympathy with the leader
articles in the newspapers today,

323
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,800
baying for blood.

324
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:34,880
Wanting my head.
People have to be angry at someone.

325
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:39,920
But as leader,
one cannot simply react to everything.

326
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,160
We need the power stations,
we need the coal.

327
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:46,080
The people need to burn coal
to warm their homes.

328
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:51,400
-It is weather. It will pass.
-Well, I do hope so.

329
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:54,840
Not least because my husband's mood
is intolerable.

330
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:55,920
Why?

331
00:29:56,920 --> 00:30:00,440
Well, being caged in like this.
He can't fly.

332
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:07,040
-Fly where?
-Well, nowhere, he is learning to fly.

333
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,600
Whatever for?

334
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:14,320
Have we not enough qualified pilots
to take him where he needs to go?

335
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:18,200
No, he wants to fly himself.
It's a boyhood dream.

336
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:21,360
-It's what he's always wanted.
-Why was government not consulted?

337
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,640
Because it's a private matter.
And I am in favor.

338
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:28,200
Nothing you or His Royal Highness do
is a private matter.

339
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,560
And the father
of the future king of England

340
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:33,480
risking his life needlessly is...

341
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:34,600
quite unacceptable.

342
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:39,480
Please. Do not curtail my husband's
personal freedoms any further.

343
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:42,880
You've taken away his home.
You've taken away his name.

344
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,800
There comes a time
where one must draw a line in the sand.

345
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:50,080
And the job of drawing that line
falls to Cabinet, ma'am. Not to you.

346
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:53,280
Something your dear late papa
would certainly have taught you

347
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:56,480
had he been granted more time
to complete your education.

348
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:00,160
And now our time is up.

349
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:05,920
Until next week.

350
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,760
[Churchill grumbles]

351
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:12,840
[page] Sir.

352
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:19,880
[Churchill] Meteorological report.

353
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:25,160
[reporter]<i> Good morning. The time is</i>
<i>eight o'clock on the 8th of December</i>

354
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,520
<i>and here is the news.</i>

355
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:30,520
<i>The choking, eye-watering fog which</i>
<i>has already caused two days of chaos</i>

356
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:33,400
<i>across the capital</i>
<i>has worsened overnight.</i>

357
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:36,760
<i>The great coal-burning electricity</i>
<i>stations in Battersea and Fulham,</i>

358
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:38,280
<i>have attempted to reduce emissions</i>

359
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:40,960
<i>of poisonous sulphur dioxide</i>
<i>from their chimneys.</i>

360
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:43,320
<i>But we've been told that it is unlikely</i>

361
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:47,120
<i>they'll be able to make any significant</i>
<i>change to the air quality.</i>

362
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:50,680
<i>The government is expected</i>
<i>to make a statement later today.</i>

363
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:52,760
[coughing, sobbing]

364
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:03,240
-Come on, let's get you to hospital.
-I'm fine.

365
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:06,400
You're not. Come on. Let's get you up.

366
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,640
Shoes.

367
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:14,040
[Mary coughs]

368
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:21,880
Off we go. Arm in. And the other.

369
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:34,080
[Mary coughs]

370
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:38,080
-[Mary] I can't breathe.
-Do as I say and hold onto me.

371
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:50,840
-[Venetia] Come along.
-[coughs]

372
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:54,280
-[glass smashes]
-[shouting]

373
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,800
[engine purrs]

374
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,560
Quick, hold my hand.

375
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,120
[man] Make way!

376
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:21,840
[man] You all right, lady?

377
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:33,360
Control of this story
is getting away from us.

378
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:37,320
The opposition's blood is up.
We have to respond.

379
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,720
Respond how?

380
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:41,000
I would suggest
by commissioning a public enquiry.

381
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,760
An enquiry would be expensive.

382
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:50,880
Winston, people are angry.
They see us as the culprits.

383
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:57,160
Culpable for what? It's fog. Fog is fog.
It comes and it goes away.

384
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:01,160
Well, I'm glad that the Prime Minister
finds time for levity.

385
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:05,760
Perhaps I should remind him exactly
how serious the situation has now become.

386
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:09,840
This morning a suburban train
collided with a gang of railway workmen,

387
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:12,560
killing several
and injuring a great many more.

388
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:17,000
In parts of the capital, there is now
a total breakdown of law and order.

389
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,240
Hospitals are filling up,

390
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:22,360
as our citizens are breathing in
poisonous sulphur dioxide.

391
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:34,200
Sometimes we have sunshine.

392
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:37,120
Too much sunshine
and they call it a drought.

393
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,000
Then we have rain.

394
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:43,840
Too much rain, and they call it a deluge
and find a way to blame us for that too.

395
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:46,000
It's an act of God, Bobbety.

396
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:51,320
It's weather. And for better or for worse,
we get a great deal of it on this island.

397
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:54,600
Frankly, there are more pressing matters
to deal with.

398
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:58,280
-Like what?
-The Duke of Edinburgh.

399
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,600
[telephone rings]

400
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,720
[jovial chatter]

401
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,920
[butler] Telephone, sir.
The Marquis of Salisbury.

402
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,160
Oh, not now.

403
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:20,040
He asked me to stress
the importance of the matter.

404
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:28,040
-Bobbety.
<i>-Thanks for taking my call, Dickie.</i>

405
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:30,360
<i>-Are you alone?</i>
-Yes.

406
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:33,600
Can anyone overhear what you're saying?

407
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:39,320
-No.
-Good.

408
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:44,080
-It's chaos.
-I know.

409
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,280
Every ward is full. Every corridor too.

410
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:49,880
Most of the doctors are sick now,
and those that are well can't get in.

411
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,640
It was better than this in the war.

412
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:54,280
What do you need?
More equipment? Or masks?

413
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,320
Masks are bloody useless.
They're just for show.

414
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,600
To make it look like the government
is doing something.

415
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:02,200
-Then what is needed?
-Money. People. Trained staff.

416
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:04,120
Help is what is needed. Urgently.

417
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,080
Let her rest for now.

418
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:13,600
Maybe I can put a word in
with the people who make a difference.

419
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:17,320
-Such as?
-The Prime Minister, for example.

420
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:20,360
I see. You're just going to walk into
Downing Street and whisper in his ear.

421
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:22,360
Yes, something like that.

422
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:26,200
You know, my day is bad enough without
some delusional girl playing jokes.

423
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:29,440
Now, excuse me. Nurse? Nurse.

424
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:34,680
-[Venetia] I'll show you.
-Get out of the way.

425
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,280
-[man] Jim, where are you?
-[man 2] Over here.

426
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:50,840
[horn, brakes]

427
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,600
[man] Someone phone for an ambulance.

428
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:06,360
[crowd mutters]

429
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,600
How much longer
are you going to give the old man?

430
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,120
Their majority is tiny.

431
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,880
A vote of no confidence
and he'll be toppled.

432
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,800
You know what he calls you?

433
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:21,080
Yes, I know.
A sheep in sheep's clothing.

434
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:26,120
Perhaps it's time to prove you're not.

435
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,200
Very well.

436
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:36,280
Let's put a motion down on paper
and brief the whips.

437
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,280
[man] Thank you, sir.

438
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,600
[Philip whistles]

439
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:07,280
-Anything interesting?
-Yes.

440
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:11,560
-Care to share it?
-No.

441
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:16,120
I'd be happy to share glide ratios
and adiabatic lapse rates with you.

442
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:18,400
As part of a quid pro quo arrangement.

443
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:22,200
One glide ratio in return
for some cabinet minutes, for example.

444
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:27,760
No? A dihedral angle
or an absolute ceiling.

445
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:30,520
These are very interesting concepts.
You might learn something,

446
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:33,600
in exchange for a foreign office briefing?

447
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:37,040
Am I going to have to explain
my position again?

448
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:39,320
-No.
-Good.

449
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,840
"Once you have tasted flight,

450
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:46,520
you will forever walk the earth
with your eyes turned skyward,

451
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:50,640
for there you have been
and there you will always long to return."

452
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:55,120
You know what's remarkable
about those words?

453
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,800
-Go on.
-They were written 300 years

454
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,560
before man first got in a plane.

455
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:03,160
Leonardo da Vinci.

456
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,880
-Look, Philip, I know--
-[knocking on door]

457
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:12,520
Lord Mountbatten, Your Majesty.

458
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:15,800
-Uncle Dickie. What's he doing here?
-I know as much as you do.

459
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:17,640
[Equerry] He said it was important, ma'am.

460
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:18,760
Thank you.

461
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:25,080
Elizabeth.

462
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:31,240
-Hello.
-I came as soon as I could.

463
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:33,600
So...

464
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:40,240
Oh, is this a meeting
with Elizabeth your niece, my wife?

465
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,720
-Or the Queen?
-The latter, I'm afraid.

466
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,720
Right, then I know my place.

467
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:56,920
-What's the matter with him?
-Nothing.

468
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:02,480
He's just feeling a little grounded.
Ignore it.

469
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,680
Right, all ears.

470
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:09,960
I received a telephone call today
from Bobbety Salisbury.

471
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:13,960
It seems that even among his own people
the feeling is that our Prime Minister

472
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:17,080
is not able to deal
with a national crisis.

473
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:23,280
Indeed he could be seen
to be responsible for that crisis.

474
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:25,880
Hospitals are overflowing. People dying.

475
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:28,880
As sovereign,
you have the right to demand

476
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:32,880
that a government in your name
shows effective leadership.

477
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:38,680
The opposition are now calling
for a motion of no confidence.

478
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:42,720
So, I would say the time has come

479
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:47,920
for you to... summon Churchill and...

480
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,040
And what?

481
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:53,800
Insist that he go.

482
00:40:56,520 --> 00:41:00,040
-I can't do that.
-You can, and should.

483
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:04,600
But wouldn't that violate
the constitution?

484
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:06,920
As queen...

485
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:12,520
you have the right to be consulted.

486
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:17,760
The right to encourage. The right to warn.

487
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:22,560
Also, to appoint a new Prime Minister
in the event of incapacity

488
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:28,800
and many would say that Churchill's
behavior now constitutes incapacity.

489
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:32,520
-Then a revolution must come from within.
-They are trying.

490
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:35,760
-Well, then, they must try harder.
-They will.

491
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:39,800
But would prefer it to be bloodless.

492
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:43,760
So have asked for your help and influence.

493
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:48,920
I cannot do it. I will not do it.

494
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:53,120
Let's not forget it was Churchill
who denied Philip's children

495
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:54,920
-his own surname...
-Dickie.

496
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,080
...and insisted that you live
in Buckingham Palace.

497
00:41:57,160 --> 00:42:00,560
-As, alas, did everyone else.
-And now with looters on the street

498
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:02,640
and hospital corridors
stacked with the dead,

499
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:05,320
he is interested in only one thing.

500
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:09,880
Stopping Philip flying.

501
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,240
-What?
-At a crisis cabinet meeting this morning

502
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:16,560
when there should've only been
one thing on the agenda,

503
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:19,080
the unfolding national emergency...

504
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:26,440
all our Prime Minister wanted to discuss
was your husband's new hobby.

505
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:34,120
-I'm so sorry, sir.
-Who are her parents?

506
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:36,120
Her father is a clergyman. From Suffolk.

507
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:38,640
-They've been notified.
-I want to go to the hospital.

508
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:41,760
There is an emergency meeting
at the House. A meeting you must attend.

509
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:43,240
The House can wait.

510
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:51,760
[knocking]

511
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:56,240
-You wished to see me, Your Majesty?
-Yes, Tommy.

512
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:02,320
<i>I know how much my father</i>
<i>depended on you.</i>

513
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:06,560
And how closely you worked together.

514
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:09,840
Which is why I wanted to ask your advice.
Now...

515
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:16,320
It seems our Prime Minister, a man
who's led the country through many crises,

516
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,640
is no longer leading us at all.

517
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:22,800
Representations have been made to me,

518
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:25,320
through an intermediary
from the heart of the government,

519
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:32,520
to intercede and bid him stand down.
Make way for a younger man.

520
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:36,960
Which brings me to my question.

521
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:42,960
What are my responsibilities,
as head of state?

522
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:47,560
What should I do?

523
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:50,840
When it's in the national interest?
How far dare I go?

524
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:57,400
I'm not sure if her Majesty is aware,

525
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:03,080
but shortly before your father died
the Foreign Secretary, Mr. Eden, came,

526
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:05,800
begging his late Majesty to intervene,

527
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:09,800
if not on an official level,
then on a personal one.

528
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:13,280
As a friend.
To bid the Prime Minister to resign.

529
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:17,760
-What did my father say?
-Well...

530
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:19,720
His Majesty was,
like his father before him,

531
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:22,280
a stickler for convention and tradition,

532
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:25,720
and would never have done anything
that violated the constitution,

533
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:28,680
or overstepped the mark.

534
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:33,000
-Then I have my answer.
-But...

535
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:35,720
that was His Majesty, not Your Majesty.

536
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:39,880
And I do read the newspapers,
and I do listen to the wireless,

537
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:43,200
and the situation we're in today
is quite different,

538
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:46,160
than the one we were in when Mr. Eden
came to see your father.

539
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:51,840
Different situation, different sovereign.

540
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:04,760
[Churchill] Wait for me here.

541
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:11,800
[coughing]

542
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
[chaotic chatter]

543
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:57,400
[door opens]

544
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:03,640
Sir.

545
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:08,160
Just a child.

546
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:12,520
A beautiful child.

547
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:17,720
I just received word
from Buckingham Palace.

548
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:21,360
-The Queen has requested an audience.
-When?

549
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:23,440
At your earliest convenience.

550
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:33,840
"All energy and hope
and passion and fire."

551
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:37,680
Sir?

552
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:41,320
[curious whispering]

553
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:51,600
-Do the newspapers know I'm here?
-No.

554
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:57,480
-But it could easily be arranged.
-Then do it.

555
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:02,160
And tell the Queen
I'll be there first thing in the morning.

556
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:05,640
After the papers.

557
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:25,600
[chatter]

558
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:38,560
Good God.

559
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,040
Dear God.

560
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:57,680
Just come on in, the Prime Minister
will be here in a few moments.

561
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:08,640
[muttering]

562
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:11,400
[knocking]

563
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:15,280
-They're ready for you, sir.
-Yes, yes. One moment.

564
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:22,040
[reporters clamor]

565
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:25,760
[journalist] Quiet. Please. Settle down.

566
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:32,360
-Mr. Churchill?
-I have witnessed scenes here today,

567
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:37,960
the likes of which we have not seen
since the darkest days of the Blitz.

568
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:44,320
But alongside the suffering,
I have also seen heroism.

569
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:48,640
And where there is heroism
there will always be hope.

570
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:57,640
<i>Only God can lift the fog,</i>
<i>but I, as Prime Minister,</i>

571
00:48:57,720 --> 00:49:01,560
<i>am in position to ease the suffering.</i>

572
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:05,840
<i>To that end, I pledge to make available</i>
<i>with immediate effect,</i>

573
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:11,240
more money for hospital staff,
more money for equipment,

574
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:17,280
and a full and independent public enquiry
into the causes of air pollution...

575
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:22,400
<i>to ensure that such a calamity</i>

576
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:26,160
<i>may never befall us again.</i>

577
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:29,560
Thank you all.

578
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:31,440
[reporters shout questions]

579
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:37,040
[Philip] <i>"The Prime Minister</i>
<i>was alone among senior politicians</i>

580
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:40,960
to visit hospitals
and respond to the crisis in person.

581
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:43,520
And was rewarded by cheers and applause,

582
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:47,840
by those suffering through the worst smog
this city has ever witnessed."

583
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:52,320
The headline reads,
"True leader in a crisis."

584
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:54,400
[knocking on door]

585
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:58,440
Ma'am, the Prime Minister's here.

586
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:03,440
"The parallels
between his appearance yesterday,

587
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:05,840
and the war time years was striking.

588
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:10,160
<i>And his personal popularity</i>
<i>among the people remains undimmed."</i>

589
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:14,120
<i>Hello?</i>

590
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:19,800
<i>Clem, are you still there? Hello? Clem?</i>

591
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:25,120
<i>Clem, can you hear me? No, right...</i>

592
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:21,400
-[bell rings]
-[door opens]

593
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:28,320
The Prime Minister, Your Majesty.

594
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:37,600
Your Majesty.

595
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:44,800
-You asked to see me, ma'am?
-I did.

596
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:59,280
There is a delicate matter
which I felt I needed to discuss with you.

597
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:02,720
-In person.
-Concerning what?

598
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:07,000
Your position.

599
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:10,680
My position?

600
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:13,040
Yes. Your position...

601
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:18,520
as Prime Minister.

602
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:24,560
Go on.

603
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:30,680
[Churchill]<i> At that point she hesitated...</i>

604
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:37,600
and then she asked me to pick
either Khawaja Nazimuddin of Pakistan

605
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:39,720
or Sidney Holland of New Zealand.

606
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:43,640
-Whatever for?
-To sit next to at dinner!

607
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:46,800
No, she summoned you for that?

608
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:48,720
Oh, no, I think she summoned me

609
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:51,880
to haul me over the coals
for my handling of the fog,

610
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:54,160
but then the fog lifted,

611
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:57,440
and she had to make a decision
right then and there, in the room.

612
00:52:57,520 --> 00:53:01,240
You could see the wheels
turning behind her eyes.

613
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:06,200
And then she switched her tack
without so much as a flicker. Clever.

614
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:09,640
-No, no, not clever. Ingenious.
-Why?

615
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:14,120
Because it disarmed me.
And made me switch tack too.

616
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:15,560
What about?

617
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:19,640
About allowing Philip to learn to fly.
He can now.

618
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:20,720
Good.

619
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:25,760
But he still has to ask Cabinet
permission to do rolls and spins.

620
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,960
What, dear girl?

621
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:42,680
But what if the fog hadn't lifted?

622
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:47,800
And the government
had continued to flounder?

623
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:50,200
And people had continued to die?

624
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:53,360
And Churchill
had continued to cling to power

625
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:56,120
and the country had continued to suffer?

626
00:53:57,120 --> 00:54:01,760
It doesn't feel right,
as Head of State, to do nothing.

627
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:05,120
-It is exactly right.
-Is it?

628
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:08,280
But surely doing nothing is no job at all?

629
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:11,480
To do nothing is the hardest job of all.

630
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:14,840
And it will take every ounce of energy
that you have.

631
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:19,040
To be impartial is not natural,
not human.

632
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:22,880
People will always want you to smile
or agree or frown.

633
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:27,120
And the minute you do, you will have
declared a position. A point of view.

634
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:31,640
And that is the one thing as sovereign
that you are not entitled to do.

635
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:37,560
The less you do,
the less you say or agree or smile--

636
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:40,880
Or think? Or feel? Or breathe? Or exist?

637
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:42,320
The better.

638
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:47,640
Well, that's fine for the sovereign.

639
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,880
But where does that leave me?

640
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:06,400
[Philip]<i> So go on.</i>

641
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:08,600
How long would it take me to get my wings?

642
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:11,800
Well, normally, a trainee would spend
anything between 100 and 120 hours

643
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:13,400
in one of these things.

644
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:15,600
Do you think I could do it
in three months?

645
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:17,880
That would be unusual, sir.

646
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:22,480
I'm a fast learner, and believe me
when I say I've got nothing else to do.

647
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:39,720
[Philip] I couldn't help notice
you filled her right up.

648
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:42,680
-Starboard and port. Eighteen gallons?
-[Townsend] Yes.

649
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:45,320
-[Philip] Fancy lunch in Edinburgh?
-Edinburgh?

650
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:48,760
[Philip] They made me Duke there, so I
should probably show up from time to time.

651
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:50,960
Unless you have
more pressing engagements?

652
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:52,040
[Townsend] No, sir.

653
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:56,240
[Philip] All right, I'll adjust RPMs
and cruising speed for range flying.

654
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:59,320
[Townsend] We'll have to land to refuel,
sir. RAF Finningley.

655
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:02,000
-[Philip] Oh, really? Where's that?
-Doncaster.

656
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:05,120
[Philip] Doncaster? Right.
