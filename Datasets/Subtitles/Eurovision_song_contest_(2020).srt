<i>-No.</i><br/><i>-Probably not.</i>

826
00:39:54,875 --> 00:39:55,708
<i>No.</i>

827
00:39:56,583 --> 00:40:00,166
<i>You are Alexander Lemtov</i><br/><i>and I have heard you singing on the stage.</i>

828

<i>-Do you--</i><br/><i>-We could--</i>

834
00:40:14,166 --> 00:40:16,583
<i>The only thing is</i><br/><i>we have to finish the remix.</i>

835
00:40:16,666 --> 00:40:18,916
<i>This is shame. </i><br/><i>All of best performers,</i>

00:40:47,875 --> 00:40:49,125
<i>He is a sex player.</i>

850
00:40:49,416 --> 00:40:51,000
<i>Pfft... No.</i>

851
00:40:51,083 --> 00:40:52,583
<i>I don't know about that.</i>

852
00:40:52,666 --> 00:40:53,625
<i>[Lars] I do.</i>

853
00:40:53,708 --> 00:40:56,416
<i>No one travels around</i><br/><i>with four guys like that. Come on.</i>

854
00:40:57,083 --> 00:40:58,916
<i>Besides, he's a slick customer.</i>

855
00:40:59,375 --> 00:41:00,916
<i>And he probably has a very large penis.</i>

856
00:41:01,291 --> 00:41:02,375
<i>Oh, yes, yes.</i>

857
00:41:02,458 --> 00:41:04,541
<i>I sense that he does have </i><br/><i>a very large penis.</i>

858
00:41:04,625 --> 00:41:05,833
<i>I think that's true. Yeah.</i>

859
00:41:05,916 --> 00:41:08,708
<i>Yeah. He's got a BDE Hundo P.</i>

00:41:12,875 --> 00:41:14,083
<i>-No question.</i><br/><i>-No.</i>

864
00:41:14,166 --> 00:41:16,625
<i>Well, I think </i><br/><i>he's just being friendly, really.</i>

865
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:17,875
<i>[scoffs]</i>

866
00:41:18,416 --> 00:41:19,250
<i>Remember,</i>

867
00:41:19,625 --> 00:41:21,208
<i>we don't need friends, okay?</i>

868
00:41:21,958 --> 00:41:22,958
<i>We need to win.</i>

869
00:41:23,041 --> 00:41:25,041
<i>[dance music playing]</i>

870

871
00:41:33,750 --> 00:41:34,666
<i>[Sigrit] Amazing!</i>

872
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:37,916
<i>[Lars] Yeah, it looks kind of old to me,</i><br/><i>like it's about to fall apart.</i>

873
00:41:38,541 --> 00:41:39,375
<i>[both gasp]</i>

874
00:41:39,458 --> 00:41:41,625
<i>-Someone just opened our doors.</i><br/><i>-Yes.</i>

<i>[indistinct overlapping chatter]</i>

879
00:41:54,833 --> 00:41:57,166
<i>Sigrit, Lars, you came.</i>

880
00:41:57,250 --> 00:41:59,166

<i>Yes.</i>

892
00:42:20,625 --> 00:42:22,916
<i>The penises on the Greek statues...</i>

893
00:42:23,208 --> 00:42:24,958
<i>-Yeah.</i><br/><i>-...they are very dangly.</i>

894
00:42:25,041 --> 00:42:30,208
<i>Yes, I love the history and this just</i><br/><i>the way the Ancient Greek make statues.</i>

895
00:42:30,291 --> 00:42:32,416
<i>So these are Ancient Greek statues?</i>

896
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:33,625
<i>Yes, of course.</i>

897
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:35,791
<i>-That's was my question, too. Yes.</i><br/><i>-Yeah.</i>

898

<i>Oh, um...</i>

970
00:45:44,291 --> 00:45:45,125
<i>I-- You--</i>

971
00:45:45,208 --> 00:45:47,583
<i>Lars would really love this. [chuckles]</i>

972
00:45:47,666 --> 00:45:50,375
<i>-Maybe...</i><br/><i>-Sigrit. Sigrit, Sigrit.</i>

973
00:45:52,041 --> 00:45:54,041

<i>God, do you only think of winning?</i>

975
00:45:57,041 --> 00:45:58,041
<i>Of course.</i>

976
00:45:58,208 --> 00:46:01,625
<i>Now I have to become an international star</i><br/><i>to prove to all of Iceland,</i>

977
00:46:01,916 --> 00:46:04,000
<i>and my extremely handsome father,</i>

978
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:06,541
<i>that I have not wasted my life.</i>

979
00:46:07,250 --> 00:46:08,416
<i>[Mita] Oh, my God.</i>

980
00:46:10,166 --> 00:46:12,500
<i>-Well, I really like you now.</i><br/><i>-Oh.</i>

981
00:46:12,791 --> 00:46:16,250
<i>That-- That's something, it excited me, </i><br/><i>you know? [chuckles]</i>

982
00:46:16,583 --> 00:46:18,250
<i>I have heard you sing.</i>

983
00:46:19,250 --> 00:46:21,125
<i>You are very good, but...</i>

984
00:46:21,583 --> 00:46:23,083
<i>I think there is more.</i>

985
00:46:24,291 --> 00:46:26,000
<i>I think you sing from here...</i>

<i>You... didn't quit.</i>

1817
