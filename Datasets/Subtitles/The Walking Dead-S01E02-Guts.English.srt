1
00:00:03,045 --> 00:00:05,047
- ( birds chirping )
- ( bugs chittering )

2
00:00:09,218 --> 00:00:11,303
Boy: Mom!

3
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:13,388
Right here.

4
00:00:19,228 --> 00:00:21,939
( pots rattling )

5
00:00:26,568 --> 00:00:28,195
Any luck?

6
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,822
How do we tell if they're poison?

7
00:00:32,865 --> 00:00:36,327
Uh, there's only
one sure way I know of.

8
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:40,248
Ask Shane when he gets back?

9
00:00:40,414 --> 00:00:41,916
Yeah, you've got it.

10
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:43,417
Thank you.

11
00:00:46,045 --> 00:00:48,464
Dale, I'm heading out.

12
00:00:48,631 --> 00:00:51,342
Sweetheart, I want you to stay
where Dale can see you, okay?

13
00:00:51,509 --> 00:00:53,093
Yes, Mom.

14
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:55,345
Dale: You too.
Don't wander too far.

15
00:00:55,512 --> 00:00:56,930
Stay within shouting distance.

16
00:00:57,097 --> 00:00:59,766
And if you see anything, holler.
I'll come running.

17
00:00:59,933 --> 00:01:01,809
( softly )
Yes, Mom.

18
00:01:04,061 --> 00:01:06,063
( bugs chittering )

19
00:01:29,628 --> 00:01:31,630
( leaves rustle )

20
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:37,427
( bird wings flap )

21
00:02:08,541 --> 00:02:10,501
- ( branch snaps )
- ( gasps )

22
00:02:10,668 --> 00:02:12,670
( wings flap )

23
00:02:16,299 --> 00:02:19,135
( branches snapping )

24
00:02:31,898 --> 00:02:33,566
- ( gasps )
- ( panting )

25
00:02:36,778 --> 00:02:39,072
Shh shh shh
shh shh shh shh.

26
00:02:41,366 --> 00:02:43,201
- ( chuckles )
- You scared the hell out of me.

27
00:02:43,368 --> 00:02:45,495
I bet. That's what you get
for keeping me waiting.

28
00:02:45,662 --> 00:02:46,996
I was trying to be quiet.

29
00:02:47,163 --> 00:02:49,207
- Where you been?
- Amy the mushroom queen--

30
00:02:49,374 --> 00:02:51,501
I had to wait
for her to get back.

31
00:02:57,632 --> 00:02:59,841
- How much time we have?
- Enough.

32
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,396
( moans )

33
00:03:42,384 --> 00:03:44,845
( both moaning )

34
00:03:53,687 --> 00:03:55,563
- Come here.
- Okay.

35
00:03:59,275 --> 00:04:01,277
( both grunting )

36
00:04:03,904 --> 00:04:06,489
( theme music playing )

37
00:04:44,569 --> 00:04:47,405
( zombies growling, moaning )

38
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,874
- ( radio beeping, hissing )
- ( pounding )

39
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:01,084
Man on radio:
Hey, are you alive in there?

40
00:05:01,251 --> 00:05:02,627
( thuds, grunts )

41
00:05:03,961 --> 00:05:06,589
- Hello? Hello?
- ( man sighs ) There you are.

42
00:05:06,756 --> 00:05:08,340
You had me wondering.

43
00:05:08,507 --> 00:05:09,925
Where are you? Outside?

44
00:05:10,091 --> 00:05:11,551
Can you see me right now?

45
00:05:11,718 --> 00:05:13,762
Man:
Yeah, I can see you.

46
00:05:13,929 --> 00:05:16,556
You're surrounded by walkers.
That's the bad news.

47
00:05:16,723 --> 00:05:18,475
There's good news?

48
00:05:18,642 --> 00:05:21,311
- Man: No.
- Listen, whoever you are,

49
00:05:21,478 --> 00:05:23,939
I don't mind telling you
I'm a little concerned in here.

50
00:05:24,105 --> 00:05:27,567
Man: Oh man.
You should see it from over here.

51
00:05:27,734 --> 00:05:30,111
You'd be having a major freak-out.

52
00:05:30,278 --> 00:05:32,614
Got any advice for me?

53
00:05:32,781 --> 00:05:36,117
Man:
Yeah, I'd say make a run for it.

54
00:05:38,036 --> 00:05:40,121
That's it? "Make a run for it"?

55
00:05:40,288 --> 00:05:41,832
Man: My way's not
as dumb as it sounds.

56
00:05:41,998 --> 00:05:43,874
You've got eyes
on the outside here.

57
00:05:44,041 --> 00:05:46,502
There's one geek still up on the tank
but the others have climbed down

58
00:05:46,669 --> 00:05:48,796
and joined the feeding frenzy
where the horse went down.

59
00:05:48,963 --> 00:05:50,673
- With me so far?
- So far.

60
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,467
Okay, the street on the other side
of the tank is less crowded.

61
00:05:53,634 --> 00:05:56,053
If you move now while they're
distracted, you stand a chance.

62
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:58,222
- You got ammo?
- In that duffel bag

63
00:05:58,389 --> 00:06:00,349
I dropped out there,
and guns. Can I get to it?

64
00:06:00,516 --> 00:06:02,852
Man: Forget the bag, okay?
It's not an option.

65
00:06:03,018 --> 00:06:05,354
- What do you have on you?
- Hang on.

66
00:06:08,147 --> 00:06:10,191
( gun clicks, clatters )

67
00:06:23,162 --> 00:06:26,291
Yeah. Yeah.

68
00:06:26,457 --> 00:06:28,960
I've got a Beretta with one clip,

69
00:06:29,127 --> 00:06:31,880
- 15 rounds.
- Make ‘em count.

70
00:06:32,046 --> 00:06:34,674
Jump off the right side of the tank,
keep going in that direction.

71
00:06:34,841 --> 00:06:37,218
There's an alley up the street,
maybe 50 yards.

72
00:06:37,385 --> 00:06:39,137
Be there.

73
00:06:39,304 --> 00:06:41,306
Hey, what's your name?

74
00:06:41,472 --> 00:06:44,142
Have you been listening?
You're running out of time.

75
00:06:44,309 --> 00:06:45,560
Right.

76
00:06:46,644 --> 00:06:48,938
( breathing heavily )

77
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,902
( growling )

78
00:06:54,986 --> 00:06:56,738
( groans )

79
00:07:01,701 --> 00:07:04,203
- Ah!
- ( zombies moaning )

80
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:05,788
( gunshots )

81
00:07:16,299 --> 00:07:17,842
Whoa! Not dead!

82
00:07:18,009 --> 00:07:19,385
Come on! Come on!

83
00:07:19,552 --> 00:07:21,304
Back here!

84
00:07:22,347 --> 00:07:24,974
Come on! Come on!

85
00:07:26,768 --> 00:07:28,268
( gunshot )

86
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:32,272
What are you doing?! Come on!

87
00:07:37,152 --> 00:07:39,279
( growling )

88
00:07:43,617 --> 00:07:45,285
Come on, get up.

89
00:07:45,452 --> 00:07:47,955
( both panting )

90
00:07:56,463 --> 00:07:58,632
Nice moves there,
Clint Eastwood.

91
00:07:58,799 --> 00:08:01,927
You the new sheriff come riding
in to clean up the town?

92
00:08:02,094 --> 00:08:05,138
- It wasn't my intention.
- Yeah, whatever. Yeehaw.

93
00:08:05,305 --> 00:08:07,933
You're still a dumbass.

94
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:10,811
Rick. Thanks.

95
00:08:11,853 --> 00:08:14,147
Glenn. You're welcome.

96
00:08:15,649 --> 00:08:16,817
Oh no.

97
00:08:16,984 --> 00:08:19,319
( growling )

98
00:08:24,449 --> 00:08:25,993
The bright side:

99
00:08:26,159 --> 00:08:28,161
it'll be the fall that kills us.

100
00:08:28,328 --> 00:08:30,872
I'm a glass-half-full kind of guy.

101
00:08:37,254 --> 00:08:39,130
Rick: Are you the one
that barricaded the alley?

102
00:08:39,296 --> 00:08:42,341
Somebody did--
I guess when the city got overrun.

103
00:08:42,508 --> 00:08:45,219
Whoever did it was thinking
not many geeks would get through.

104
00:08:45,386 --> 00:08:47,388
Back at the tank, why'd you stick
your neck out for me?

105
00:08:47,555 --> 00:08:49,764
Call it foolish, naive hope

106
00:08:49,931 --> 00:08:52,058
that if I'm ever
that far up Shit Creek,

107
00:08:52,225 --> 00:08:53,601
somebody might
do the same for me.

108
00:08:53,768 --> 00:08:56,353
Guess I'm an even bigger
dumbass than you.

109
00:09:14,079 --> 00:09:16,331
I'm back. Got a guest
plus four geeks in the alley.

110
00:09:19,043 --> 00:09:21,003
( zombies growling )

111
00:09:32,473 --> 00:09:34,391
- Glenn: Let's go!
- ( men grunting )

112
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:37,770
Man:
Morales, let's go!

113
00:09:41,065 --> 00:09:42,733
Woman: You son of a bitch.
We ought to kill you.

114
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:45,861
- Just chill out, Andrea. Back off.
- Come on, ease up.

115
00:09:46,028 --> 00:09:47,362
Andrea: Ease up?
You're kidding me, right?

116
00:09:47,529 --> 00:09:49,698
We're dead because
of this stupid asshole.

117
00:09:49,865 --> 00:09:53,494
Andrea, I said
back the hell off.

118
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:01,042
Or pull the trigger.

119
00:10:04,462 --> 00:10:06,839
We're dead-- all of us--

120
00:10:07,923 --> 00:10:09,758
because of you.

121
00:10:11,593 --> 00:10:14,012
I don't understand.

122
00:10:14,179 --> 00:10:17,099
Look, we came into the city
to scavenge supplies.

123
00:10:17,265 --> 00:10:19,351
You know what the key
to scavenging is? Surviving!

124
00:10:19,518 --> 00:10:22,311
You know the key to surviving?
Sneaking in and out, tiptoeing.

125
00:10:22,478 --> 00:10:24,438
Not shooting up the streets
like it's the O.K. Corral.

126
00:10:24,605 --> 00:10:27,149
Every geek for miles around
heard you popping off rounds.

127
00:10:27,316 --> 00:10:29,401
You just rang the dinner bell.

128
00:10:29,568 --> 00:10:31,403
Morales:
Get the picture now?

129
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:33,656
( growling )

130
00:10:38,452 --> 00:10:40,454
Andrea: Oh God.

131
00:10:45,751 --> 00:10:47,962
What the hell were you
doing out there anyway?

132
00:10:48,129 --> 00:10:49,463
Trying to flag the helicopter.

133
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:51,382
Man: Helicopter?
Man, that's crap.

134
00:10:51,549 --> 00:10:53,092
- There ain't no damn helicopter.
- Woman: You were chasing

135
00:10:53,259 --> 00:10:54,635
a hallucination,
imagining things. It happens.

136
00:10:54,802 --> 00:10:56,137
I saw it.

137
00:10:57,637 --> 00:11:00,098
Morales: Hey, T-Dog, try that CB.
Can you contact the others?

138
00:11:00,265 --> 00:11:02,350
Others? The refugee center?

139
00:11:02,517 --> 00:11:05,270
Yeah, the refugee center. They've got
biscuits waiting at the oven for us.

140
00:11:05,436 --> 00:11:08,523
Got no signal.
Maybe the roof.

141
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:12,026
- ( gun firing )
- Oh no. Was that Dixon?

142
00:11:12,193 --> 00:11:14,654
- Woman: What is that maniac doing?
- Morales: Come on, let's go.

143
00:11:19,993 --> 00:11:21,869
( gun firing )

144
00:11:31,712 --> 00:11:34,756
- Hey, Dixon, are you crazy?!
- ( Dixon laughing )

145
00:11:35,924 --> 00:11:37,968
- ( gun fires )
- Andrea: Oh jeez.

146
00:11:38,135 --> 00:11:41,847
Huh? Hey! You ought to be
more polite to a man with a gun!

147
00:11:42,014 --> 00:11:44,349
Huh? Ah!

148
00:11:44,516 --> 00:11:46,184
Only common sense.
( laughing )

149
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:48,686
Man, you wasting bullets
we ain't even got, man!

150
00:11:48,853 --> 00:11:51,355
And you're bringing even more of them
down on our ass! Man, just chill.

151
00:11:51,522 --> 00:11:54,025
Hey, bad enough I've got
this taco-bender on my ass all day.

152
00:11:54,192 --> 00:11:56,027
Now I'm gonna
take orders from you?

153
00:11:56,194 --> 00:11:59,238
I don't think so, bro.
That'll be the day.

154
00:11:59,405 --> 00:12:01,240
"That'll be the day"?
You got something

155
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:03,618
- you want to tell me?
- Hey, T-Dog man, just leave it.

156
00:12:03,784 --> 00:12:05,160
- No.
- All right? It ain't worth it.

157
00:12:05,327 --> 00:12:08,330
Now, Merle, just relax, okay?

158
00:12:08,496 --> 00:12:10,332
We've got enough trouble.

159
00:12:10,498 --> 00:12:12,834
- Merle: You want to know the day?
- Yeah.

160
00:12:13,001 --> 00:12:16,630
I'll tell you the day, Mr. "Yo."
It's the day I take orders

161
00:12:16,796 --> 00:12:17,964
- from a nigger.
- Mother--

162
00:12:18,131 --> 00:12:19,925
Morales:
Hey, come on, Merle. That's enough.

163
00:12:20,091 --> 00:12:21,675
- Andrea: Okay, come on. Come on.
- ( all shouting )

164
00:12:21,842 --> 00:12:23,886
Andrea: Dixon! Dixon!

165
00:12:24,053 --> 00:12:25,387
Morales:
Whoa, cut it out, man!

166
00:12:25,554 --> 00:12:28,682
Andrea: Stop it!
Dixon, come on! Get off him!

167
00:12:28,849 --> 00:12:30,141
Dixon, you're gonna hurt him.

168
00:12:33,436 --> 00:12:35,855
Morales:
Merle, cut it out!

169
00:12:36,022 --> 00:12:38,524
( grunts )

170
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:46,115
No no no, please. Please.

171
00:12:47,991 --> 00:12:49,743
( thunder rumbling )

172
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:52,871
( T-Dog grunting )

173
00:13:02,506 --> 00:13:04,216
- ( yells )
- ( grunts )

174
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:07,176
Yeah! All right!

175
00:13:07,343 --> 00:13:10,554
We're gonna have ourselves
a little powwow, huh?

176
00:13:10,721 --> 00:13:14,183
Talk about who's in charge.

177
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:17,103
I vote me. Anybody else?

178
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:20,106
Huh? Democracy time, y'all.

179
00:13:20,273 --> 00:13:22,608
Show of hands, huh?

180
00:13:22,775 --> 00:13:25,486
All in favor? Huh?

181
00:13:25,653 --> 00:13:28,030
Come on. Let's see ‘em.

182
00:13:28,197 --> 00:13:29,240
Andrea:
Oh, come on.

183
00:13:29,407 --> 00:13:31,117
All in favor?

184
00:13:31,284 --> 00:13:34,620
Yeah. That's good.

185
00:13:34,787 --> 00:13:38,082
Yeah, that means
I'm the boss, right?

186
00:13:38,249 --> 00:13:41,460
Yeah. Anybody else?

187
00:13:41,627 --> 00:13:44,422
- Hmm? Anybody?
- Rick: Yeah.

188
00:13:47,091 --> 00:13:49,093
( grunting )

189
00:13:55,141 --> 00:13:57,810
- Who the hell are you, man?!
- Officer Friendly.

190
00:14:00,229 --> 00:14:03,149
Look here, Merle.
Things are different now.

191
00:14:03,316 --> 00:14:06,235
There are no niggers anymore.

192
00:14:06,402 --> 00:14:09,363
No dumb-as-shit,
inbred white-trash fools either.

193
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:11,991
Only dark meat
and white meat.

194
00:14:12,158 --> 00:14:13,826
There's us and the dead.

195
00:14:13,993 --> 00:14:15,785
We survive this
by pulling together,

196
00:14:15,952 --> 00:14:18,663
- not apart.
- Screw you, man.

197
00:14:20,165 --> 00:14:22,542
I can see you make a habit
of missing the point.

198
00:14:22,709 --> 00:14:25,045
Yeah? Well, screw you twice.

199
00:14:25,211 --> 00:14:27,255
Ought to be polite
to a man with a gun.

200
00:14:27,422 --> 00:14:29,132
Only common sense.

201
00:14:31,843 --> 00:14:34,512
You wouldn't. You're a cop.

202
00:14:36,139 --> 00:14:37,515
All I am anymore

203
00:14:37,682 --> 00:14:40,018
is a man looking
for his wife and son.

204
00:14:40,185 --> 00:14:43,271
Anybody gets in the way
of that is gonna lose.

205
00:14:45,147 --> 00:14:47,691
I'll give you a moment
to think about that.

206
00:14:50,027 --> 00:14:52,363
( pats )

207
00:14:58,202 --> 00:15:00,204
Got some on your nose there.

208
00:15:00,371 --> 00:15:02,498
What are you gonna do?

209
00:15:02,664 --> 00:15:04,124
Arrest me?
( laughs )

210
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:07,127
Hey! Dude, what are you doing?
Man, that's my stuff!

211
00:15:07,294 --> 00:15:09,380
Hey! ( grunts )

212
00:15:09,546 --> 00:15:11,465
If I get loose,
you'd better pray--

213
00:15:11,632 --> 00:15:14,343
yeah, you hear me, you pig?!

214
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:16,345
- You hear me?!
- Yeah, your voice carries.

215
00:15:16,512 --> 00:15:18,597
Merle:
You hear me, you filthy pig?!

216
00:15:20,557 --> 00:15:23,310
You're not Atlanta P.D.

217
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:27,897
- Where you from?
- Up the road a ways.

218
00:15:28,064 --> 00:15:32,735
( chuckles ) Well, Officer Friendly
from up the road a ways,

219
00:15:32,902 --> 00:15:36,406
- welcome to the big city.
- ( thunder rumbling )

220
00:15:36,572 --> 00:15:39,741
( zombies moaning )

221
00:15:46,832 --> 00:15:48,917
God, it's like
Times Square down there.

222
00:15:49,084 --> 00:15:53,255
- Morales: How's that signal?
- T-Dog: Like Dixon's brain-- weak.

223
00:15:54,923 --> 00:15:56,049
Morales:
Keep trying.

224
00:15:56,216 --> 00:15:57,676
Andrea:
Why? There's nothing they can do.

225
00:15:57,843 --> 00:15:59,302
Not a damn thing.

226
00:15:59,469 --> 00:16:01,763
Got some people
outside the city is all.

227
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:04,141
There's no refugee center.
That's a pipe dream.

228
00:16:04,307 --> 00:16:06,143
Rick: Then she's right.
We're on our own.

229
00:16:06,309 --> 00:16:07,477
It's up to us to find a way out.

230
00:16:07,644 --> 00:16:09,020
Merle:
Good luck with that.

231
00:16:09,187 --> 00:16:11,940
These streets ain't safe in this part
of town from what I hear.

232
00:16:12,107 --> 00:16:15,152
Ain't that right, sugar tits?

233
00:16:15,318 --> 00:16:17,446
Hey, honeybunch,

234
00:16:17,612 --> 00:16:19,239
what say you get me
out of these cuffs,

235
00:16:19,406 --> 00:16:22,492
we go off somewhere
and bump some uglies?

236
00:16:22,659 --> 00:16:26,121
- Gonna die anyway.
- I'd rather.

237
00:16:27,289 --> 00:16:30,792
Rug muncher.
I figured as much.

238
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:32,878
"The streets ain't safe."

239
00:16:33,044 --> 00:16:34,628
Now there's an understatement.

240
00:16:34,795 --> 00:16:37,465
What about under the streets?
The sewers?

241
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:39,550
Morales: Oh man.

242
00:16:39,717 --> 00:16:41,635
Hey, Glenn, check the alley.

243
00:16:41,802 --> 00:16:43,470
You see any manhole covers?

244
00:16:46,473 --> 00:16:48,475
- ( growling )
- ( thunder rumbling )

245
00:16:52,187 --> 00:16:55,315
No, must be all out on the street
where the geeks are.

246
00:16:55,482 --> 00:16:58,526
Maybe not. Old building like this
built in the '20s--

247
00:16:58,693 --> 00:17:01,488
big structures often had
drainage tunnels into the sewers

248
00:17:01,654 --> 00:17:03,907
in case of flooding
down in the subbasements.

249
00:17:04,073 --> 00:17:06,658
- Glenn: How do you know that?
- It's my job-- was.

250
00:17:06,825 --> 00:17:08,535
I worked in the city zoning office.

251
00:17:20,797 --> 00:17:22,841
Morales:
This is it? Are you sure?

252
00:17:23,008 --> 00:17:25,801
Glenn: I really scoped this place
out the other times I was here.

253
00:17:25,968 --> 00:17:28,012
It's the only thing
in the building that goes down.

254
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:30,556
But I've never gone down it.

255
00:17:30,723 --> 00:17:33,184
Who'd want to, right?

256
00:17:37,855 --> 00:17:40,525
Oh. Great.

257
00:17:42,109 --> 00:17:44,403
- We'll be right behind you.
- No, you won't. Not you.

258
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:46,614
Why not me? Think I can't?

259
00:17:46,781 --> 00:17:48,616
I wasn't--

260
00:17:48,783 --> 00:17:50,367
Speak your mind.

261
00:17:52,285 --> 00:17:56,414
Look, until now
I always came here by myself--

262
00:17:56,581 --> 00:17:59,042
in and out, grab a few things--
no problem.

263
00:17:59,209 --> 00:18:01,711
The first time I bring a group--
everything goes to hell.

264
00:18:01,878 --> 00:18:03,672
No offense.

265
00:18:05,715 --> 00:18:08,343
If you want me to go down
this gnarly hole, fine--

266
00:18:09,386 --> 00:18:11,638
but only if we do it my way.

267
00:18:11,805 --> 00:18:14,558
It's tight down there. If I run into
something and have to get out quick,

268
00:18:14,724 --> 00:18:16,893
I don't want you all jammed up
behind me getting me killed.

269
00:18:18,103 --> 00:18:21,398
I'll take one person--
not you either.

270
00:18:21,565 --> 00:18:23,774
You've got Merle's gun
and I've seen you shoot.

271
00:18:23,941 --> 00:18:25,693
I'd feel better
if you were out in that store

272
00:18:25,859 --> 00:18:27,903
watching those doors,
covering our ass.

273
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:30,239
You've got the only other gun,
so you should go with him.

274
00:18:30,406 --> 00:18:33,367
You be my wingman.
Jacqui stays here.

275
00:18:33,534 --> 00:18:35,410
Something happens,
yell down to us,

276
00:18:35,577 --> 00:18:36,995
- get us back up here in a hurry.
- Okay.

277
00:18:37,161 --> 00:18:40,248
Okay, everybody knows theirjobs.

278
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,844
( water splashing )

279
00:18:54,262 --> 00:18:56,264
( rats squeaking )

280
00:19:20,788 --> 00:19:22,624
- ( rat squeals )
- Dah!

281
00:19:32,467 --> 00:19:32,508
( zombies banging, growling )

282
00:19:32,508 --> 00:19:34,468
( zombies banging, growling )

283
00:19:47,189 --> 00:19:49,191
Sorry for the gun in your face.

284
00:19:50,442 --> 00:19:52,611
People do things
when they're afraid.

285
00:19:52,778 --> 00:19:54,946
Not that it was entirely unjustified.

286
00:19:55,113 --> 00:19:57,824
You did get us into this.

287
00:19:57,991 --> 00:19:59,993
If I get us out,
would that make up for it?

288
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:03,537
No. But it'd be a start.

289
00:20:15,841 --> 00:20:18,344
Next time though,
take the safety off.

290
00:20:18,511 --> 00:20:20,011
It won't shoot otherwise.

291
00:20:22,097 --> 00:20:24,265
- Oh.
- Is that your gun?

292
00:20:24,432 --> 00:20:26,392
It was a gift. Why?

293
00:20:30,688 --> 00:20:32,773
Little red dot means
it's ready to fire.

294
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:35,275
You may have occasion to use it.

295
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,030
Good to know.

296
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:45,202
- T-Dog: Anybody out there?
- ( thunder rumbling )

297
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:51,166
Hello? Anybody read?

298
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:52,668
I'm hoping to hear
somebody's voice,

299
00:20:52,835 --> 00:20:54,545
‘cause I'm getting sick
and tired of hearing mine.

300
00:20:54,712 --> 00:20:57,005
Yeah, well, that makes two of us.

301
00:20:57,172 --> 00:20:59,048
Why don't you knock
that crap off?

302
00:20:59,215 --> 00:21:00,758
You're giving me
a headache, boy.

303
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:03,426
Why don't you pull
your head out of your ass?

304
00:21:03,592 --> 00:21:05,260
Maybe your headache
will go away.

305
00:21:05,427 --> 00:21:08,179
- ( Merle chuckles )
- Try some positivity for a change.

306
00:21:08,346 --> 00:21:11,015
- Damn.
- I'll tell you what--

307
00:21:11,182 --> 00:21:12,517
you get me out of these cuffs

308
00:21:12,684 --> 00:21:15,395
and I'll be all "Sammy Sunshine"
positive for you.

309
00:21:16,687 --> 00:21:21,066
Hey, see that hacksaw
over there in that toolbag?

310
00:21:22,609 --> 00:21:26,405
Get it for me, hmm?
Make it worth your while.

311
00:21:26,572 --> 00:21:28,156
What do you say, man?
Come on.

312
00:21:28,322 --> 00:21:30,074
Get me out of these things.

313
00:21:30,241 --> 00:21:32,285
So you can beat my ass again?

314
00:21:33,911 --> 00:21:35,747
Or call me nigger some more?

315
00:21:35,913 --> 00:21:38,249
Come on now. It wasn't personal.

316
00:21:38,416 --> 00:21:41,252
It's just that your kind
and my kind ain't meant to mix.

317
00:21:41,419 --> 00:21:43,463
That's all.

318
00:21:43,629 --> 00:21:46,257
It don't mean we can't...
work together,

319
00:21:46,424 --> 00:21:49,510
parley, as long as there's
some kind of mutual gain involved.

320
00:21:52,764 --> 00:21:56,058
So... about that hacksaw--

321
00:21:56,225 --> 00:21:58,144
I guess you want me to get
that rifle over there too

322
00:21:58,311 --> 00:22:00,688
so you can shoot that cop
when he comes back up, huh?

323
00:22:03,691 --> 00:22:06,778
- Huh.
- ( door clangs )

324
00:22:08,237 --> 00:22:10,531
( rats squeaking )

325
00:22:16,078 --> 00:22:19,290
Morales: Yeah, we've got
ourselves a sewer tunnel.

326
00:22:19,457 --> 00:22:21,125
Jacqui was right.

327
00:22:22,293 --> 00:22:23,920
Can we cut through it?

328
00:22:24,086 --> 00:22:26,798
Morales: If we had
a blowtorch and half a day, sure.

329
00:22:26,964 --> 00:22:29,759
Dale's hacksaw sure
as hell won't do it.

330
00:22:29,926 --> 00:22:32,303
- ( rats squeaking )
- ( crunching )

331
00:22:34,388 --> 00:22:35,723
( growling )

332
00:22:41,729 --> 00:22:44,148
( zombies banging, growling )

333
00:22:44,315 --> 00:22:46,025
Andrea: Mmm.

334
00:22:51,322 --> 00:22:52,906
See something you like?

335
00:22:53,073 --> 00:22:56,493
Not me, but I know
someone who would--

336
00:22:57,993 --> 00:22:59,995
my sister.

337
00:23:00,162 --> 00:23:02,498
She's still such a kid
in some ways.

338
00:23:02,665 --> 00:23:04,416
Unicorns, dragons--

339
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:06,251
she's into all that stuff.

340
00:23:06,417 --> 00:23:08,586
But mermaids-- they rule.

341
00:23:08,753 --> 00:23:11,338
She loves mermaids.

342
00:23:11,505 --> 00:23:13,089
Why not take it?

343
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:16,300
There's a cop staring at me.

344
00:23:16,467 --> 00:23:17,969
( chuckles )

345
00:23:21,055 --> 00:23:23,015
Would it be considered looting?

346
00:23:25,434 --> 00:23:28,521
I don't think those rules
apply anymore. Do you?

347
00:23:35,528 --> 00:23:37,154
( glass shatters )

348
00:23:46,664 --> 00:23:48,666
- What did you find down there?
- Not a way out.

349
00:23:50,293 --> 00:23:51,711
We need to find a way...

350
00:23:51,878 --> 00:23:53,504
soon.

351
00:23:57,925 --> 00:23:59,885
( thunder rumbling )

352
00:24:01,595 --> 00:24:04,681
That construction site, those trucks--
they always keep keys on hand.

353
00:24:06,933 --> 00:24:09,102
Morales: You'll never
make it past the walkers.

354
00:24:09,269 --> 00:24:10,520
You got me out of that tank.

355
00:24:10,687 --> 00:24:13,064
Yeah, but they were feeding.
They were distracted.

356
00:24:13,231 --> 00:24:14,566
Rick:
Can we distract them again?

357
00:24:14,733 --> 00:24:16,942
Merle: Right. Listen to him.
He's onto something.

358
00:24:17,109 --> 00:24:19,445
A diversion,
like on "Hogan's Heroes."

359
00:24:19,612 --> 00:24:22,531
- God. Give it a rest.
- They're drawn by sound, right?

360
00:24:22,698 --> 00:24:25,743
Right, like dogs.
They hear a sound, they come.

361
00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:27,620
- Rick: What else?
- Aside from they hear you?

362
00:24:27,786 --> 00:24:30,371
They see you, smell you
and if they catch you, they eat you.

363
00:24:30,538 --> 00:24:33,416
- They can tell us by smell?
- Glenn: Can't you?

364
00:24:33,583 --> 00:24:36,210
They smell dead, we don't.
It's pretty distinct.

365
00:24:41,173 --> 00:24:42,883
If bad ideas
were an Olympic event,

366
00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:44,760
- this would take the gold.
- He's right.

367
00:24:44,927 --> 00:24:46,970
Just stop, okay?
Take some time to think this through.

368
00:24:47,137 --> 00:24:49,473
How much time? They already
got through one set of doors,

369
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,140
that glass won't hold forever.

370
00:24:56,896 --> 00:24:59,190
( zombies growling )

371
00:25:09,116 --> 00:25:11,369
( sighs )

372
00:25:47,863 --> 00:25:49,782
Wayne Dunlap.

373
00:25:49,949 --> 00:25:51,993
Georgia license.

374
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:56,163
Born in 1979.

375
00:26:00,668 --> 00:26:04,088
He had $28 in his pocket
when he died...

376
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,882
and a picture of a pretty girl.

377
00:26:11,302 --> 00:26:14,597
"With love, from Rachel."

378
00:26:15,681 --> 00:26:16,973
He used to be like us--

379
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:19,225
worrying about bills

380
00:26:19,392 --> 00:26:22,854
or the rent or the Super Bowl.

381
00:26:25,314 --> 00:26:28,735
If I ever find my family,
I'm gonna tell them about Wayne.

382
00:26:37,035 --> 00:26:39,120
Glenn:
One more thing--

383
00:26:40,538 --> 00:26:42,707
he was an organ donor.

384
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,252
- ( grunts )
- Oh!

385
00:26:47,419 --> 00:26:49,921
- Madre de Dios!
- ( chopping )

386
00:26:51,048 --> 00:26:53,592
Glenn:
Oh! God...

387
00:26:53,759 --> 00:26:55,135
damn it!

388
00:26:55,302 --> 00:26:58,138
- Oh God.
- Andrea: Oh.

389
00:26:58,305 --> 00:27:01,183
- ( all groan )
- Morales: Dios!

390
00:27:01,349 --> 00:27:02,976
Oh God.

391
00:27:04,895 --> 00:27:07,272
( all groaning )

392
00:27:11,735 --> 00:27:14,237
( groans )

393
00:27:16,448 --> 00:27:18,492
Keep chopping.

394
00:27:18,658 --> 00:27:20,242
( Glenn groaning )

395
00:27:21,786 --> 00:27:24,497
- I am so gonna hurl.
- Later.

396
00:27:32,212 --> 00:27:33,420
Andrea: Oh!

397
00:27:38,801 --> 00:27:40,677
Everybody got gloves?

398
00:27:42,637 --> 00:27:45,098
Don't get any on your skin
or in your eyes.

399
00:27:49,435 --> 00:27:51,437
( all groaning )

400
00:28:13,417 --> 00:28:15,253
Glenn:
Oh God!

401
00:28:15,419 --> 00:28:18,297
Oh jeez.
Oh, this is bad.

402
00:28:18,464 --> 00:28:19,924
This is really bad.

403
00:28:20,091 --> 00:28:21,425
Think about something else--

404
00:28:21,592 --> 00:28:23,010
puppies and kittens.

405
00:28:23,177 --> 00:28:25,221
Dead puppies and kittens.

406
00:28:26,639 --> 00:28:28,558
( vomiting )

407
00:28:28,724 --> 00:28:31,185
That is just evil.
What is wrong with you?

408
00:28:31,352 --> 00:28:33,688
Next time let
the cracker beat his ass.

409
00:28:34,730 --> 00:28:37,275
- T-Dog: I'm sorry, yo.
- Glenn: You suck!

410
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:43,989
- Do we smell like them?
- Oh yeah.

411
00:28:45,489 --> 00:28:46,991
Glenn.

412
00:28:48,993 --> 00:28:50,828
Just in case.

413
00:28:58,586 --> 00:29:00,170
If we make it back, be ready.

414
00:29:00,336 --> 00:29:02,130
What about Merle Dixon?

415
00:29:15,101 --> 00:29:16,769
Rick:
Give me the axe.

416
00:29:18,479 --> 00:29:21,733
- We nee-- we need more guts.
- Andrea: Oh God!

417
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:23,234
( door creaks )

418
00:29:25,528 --> 00:29:27,530
( zombies moaning )

419
00:29:48,134 --> 00:29:50,136
( growling )

420
00:30:29,759 --> 00:30:31,761
( zombies groaning )

421
00:31:13,636 --> 00:31:14,971
Merle:
Hey, what's happening, man?

422
00:31:15,138 --> 00:31:17,265
Morales:
Hey, T-Dog, try that CB.

423
00:31:17,432 --> 00:31:19,058
Merle: Hey, come on.
Talk to me, y'all.

424
00:31:19,225 --> 00:31:22,145
Base camp, this is T-Dog.
Anybody hear me?

425
00:31:22,312 --> 00:31:24,355
Can anybody out there hear me?

426
00:31:26,274 --> 00:31:28,901
- There.
- ( thunder rumbling )

427
00:31:29,068 --> 00:31:32,113
That asshole is out on the street
with the handcuff keys?

428
00:31:42,999 --> 00:31:47,003
Boy, that hose isn't long
for this world, is it?

429
00:31:48,087 --> 00:31:49,463
Man: No sir.

430
00:31:49,629 --> 00:31:52,507
Dale: Where the hell are
we gonna find a replacement?

431
00:31:53,799 --> 00:31:55,801
It's late. They should've
been back by now.

432
00:31:55,968 --> 00:31:58,137
Worrying won't make it better.

433
00:32:04,727 --> 00:32:06,145
- Shane: Attaboy.
- Carl: Yeah.

434
00:32:06,312 --> 00:32:08,188
Shane:
And three, two, one-- pull it.

435
00:32:08,355 --> 00:32:10,357
- Carl: Ah!
- ( both laugh )

436
00:32:11,775 --> 00:32:13,735
Shane:
Start it over.

437
00:32:15,235 --> 00:32:17,404
Make your "P" the other way--
around your finger.

438
00:32:17,571 --> 00:32:20,866
- Oops.
- Good, just tie it around your finger.

439
00:32:22,076 --> 00:32:23,535
Attaboy.

440
00:32:23,702 --> 00:32:25,746
- ( radio squawking )
- T-Dog: Hello, base camp!

441
00:32:27,246 --> 00:32:29,582
Can anybody out there hear me?

442
00:32:33,378 --> 00:32:36,214
Base camp, this is T-Dog.
Anybody hear me?

443
00:32:36,381 --> 00:32:38,091
Hello? Hello?

444
00:32:38,257 --> 00:32:39,884
Reception's bad on this end.

445
00:32:40,051 --> 00:32:43,054
- Repeat. Repeat.
- Shane, is that you?

446
00:32:43,221 --> 00:32:44,597
Is that them?

447
00:32:44,764 --> 00:32:46,599
- ( static )
- T-Dog: We're in some deep shit.

448
00:32:46,766 --> 00:32:49,685
We're trapped in
the department store.

449
00:32:49,852 --> 00:32:51,396
He say they're trapped?

450
00:32:51,562 --> 00:32:53,146
T-Dog: There are geeks
all over the place. Hundreds of ‘em.

451
00:32:53,313 --> 00:32:55,232
We're surrounded.

452
00:32:55,399 --> 00:32:57,401
T-Dog, repeat that last. Repeat.

453
00:32:57,567 --> 00:33:00,570
( static )

454
00:33:04,741 --> 00:33:06,910
- ( radio stops )
- He said the department store.

455
00:33:07,077 --> 00:33:08,495
Dale:
I heard it too.

456
00:33:09,913 --> 00:33:11,832
- Lori: Shane?
- No way.

457
00:33:11,998 --> 00:33:13,582
We do not go after them.

458
00:33:13,749 --> 00:33:15,459
We do not risk
the rest of the group.

459
00:33:15,626 --> 00:33:18,170
- Y'all know that.
- So we're just gonna leave her there?

460
00:33:18,337 --> 00:33:21,757
Look, Amy, I know that
this is not easy--

461
00:33:21,924 --> 00:33:23,259
She volunteered to go

462
00:33:23,426 --> 00:33:24,926
to help the rest of us.

463
00:33:25,093 --> 00:33:27,595
I know, and she knew
the risks, right?

464
00:33:27,762 --> 00:33:30,931
See, if she's trapped, she's gone.

465
00:33:32,182 --> 00:33:34,017
So we just have to
deal with that.

466
00:33:35,101 --> 00:33:36,519
There's nothing we can do.

467
00:33:37,937 --> 00:33:40,648
She's my sister,
you son of a bitch.

468
00:33:53,703 --> 00:33:55,746
- ( thunder rumbling )
- Lori: Amy...

469
00:33:58,583 --> 00:34:00,126
Come on.
It's all right, buddy.

470
00:34:02,462 --> 00:34:04,464
( moaning )

471
00:34:53,095 --> 00:34:56,474
( whispers )
It's gonna work. I can't believe it.

472
00:34:56,641 --> 00:34:59,852
( whispers )
Don't draw attention.

473
00:35:01,354 --> 00:35:03,356
( growling )

474
00:35:06,149 --> 00:35:08,734
( growling )

475
00:35:25,543 --> 00:35:27,545
( rain pattering )

476
00:35:32,508 --> 00:35:34,384
Oh man.

477
00:35:36,593 --> 00:35:38,595
( thunder crashes )

478
00:35:50,232 --> 00:35:51,732
It's just a cloudburst.

479
00:35:51,899 --> 00:35:54,318
We get ‘em all the time.
It'll pass real quick.

480
00:36:05,037 --> 00:36:07,039
( growling )

481
00:36:25,057 --> 00:36:27,602
The smell's washing off. Isn't it?

482
00:36:27,768 --> 00:36:29,520
- Is it washing off?
- No, it's not.

483
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:35,985
- Well, maybe.
- ( roars )

484
00:36:38,194 --> 00:36:39,446
Oh shit! Run!

485
00:36:39,613 --> 00:36:42,240
( zombies roaring )

486
00:36:52,709 --> 00:36:54,753
Come on, come on, come on.

487
00:37:16,524 --> 00:37:18,108
( gunshots )

488
00:37:24,990 --> 00:37:26,450
Rick!

489
00:37:40,214 --> 00:37:42,216
( engine starts )

490
00:37:42,383 --> 00:37:43,634
Go go go go!

491
00:37:43,801 --> 00:37:45,135
( tires screech )

492
00:38:05,155 --> 00:38:06,198
They're leaving us.

493
00:38:06,365 --> 00:38:07,408
- No. No no no no no.
- Dixon: What? What? What do you mean?

494
00:38:07,574 --> 00:38:09,868
- Where they going? Where they going?
- No no, come back.

495
00:38:14,873 --> 00:38:17,042
Oh God. Oh God.
They're all over that place!

496
00:38:17,209 --> 00:38:18,377
You need to draw them away.

497
00:38:18,544 --> 00:38:20,336
Those roll-up doors
at the front of the store--

498
00:38:20,503 --> 00:38:22,003
that area?
- -that's what I need cleared.

499
00:38:22,170 --> 00:38:25,006
Raise your friends. Tell them
to get down there and be ready.

500
00:38:25,173 --> 00:38:27,758
And I'm drawing the geeks away how?
I-- I missed that part.

501
00:38:27,925 --> 00:38:29,427
Noise.

502
00:38:29,593 --> 00:38:31,595
( car alarm blaring )

503
00:38:43,899 --> 00:38:45,901
( engine revving )

504
00:38:47,569 --> 00:38:49,778
( tires screech )

505
00:39:01,999 --> 00:39:03,834
Those roll-up doors
at the front of the store

506
00:39:04,001 --> 00:39:05,793
facing the street--
meet us there and be ready.

507
00:39:13,342 --> 00:39:15,344
( alarm continues )

508
00:39:21,017 --> 00:39:23,686
- Morales: Come on! Let's go, let's go!
- Hey, you can't leave me here!

509
00:39:23,853 --> 00:39:25,480
I'm not fooling, man! Morales!

510
00:39:25,646 --> 00:39:28,107
- Hey, man! Don't do this, Morales!
- Andrea: Come on!

511
00:39:28,274 --> 00:39:30,026
Hey, that's my gun!
You guys just can't leave me!

512
00:39:30,193 --> 00:39:32,278
- Don't leave me here, you guys!
- Morales, come on!

513
00:39:32,445 --> 00:39:34,197
I'm coming!
We've gotta go!

514
00:39:34,363 --> 00:39:36,783
Dixon: Morales!
You can't leave me like this, man!

515
00:39:36,949 --> 00:39:38,701
Hey, T-Dog. No, man.
You can't leave me, man.

516
00:39:38,868 --> 00:39:40,368
You can't leave me here--
not like this.

517
00:39:40,535 --> 00:39:42,162
You can't, man. It's not human.

518
00:39:42,329 --> 00:39:44,706
- Come on, don't do this.
- ( groans )

519
00:39:44,873 --> 00:39:46,749
