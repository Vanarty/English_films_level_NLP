1
00:02:58,849 --> 00:03:00,642
Goddamn bugs.

2
00:03:20,746 --> 00:03:22,372
Oh, shit!

3
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:28,754
Oh, crap.

4
00:03:41,016 --> 00:03:43,351
Well, Nick the Dick.
What a surprise.

5
00:03:43,602 --> 00:03:45,061
Where you coming from?

6
00:03:45,771 --> 00:03:47,647
Fishing in Cuernavaca.

7
00:03:47,898 --> 00:03:50,192
Sure. Let's take a look
at your catch.

8
00:03:51,526 --> 00:03:52,694
Come on.

9
00:04:00,285 --> 00:04:02,037
I would've thrown them back.

10
00:04:08,627 --> 00:04:11,296
What do you get?
100 bucks a head? 200?

11
00:04:11,671 --> 00:04:15,133
Hope you saved it all for your lawyer.
You'll need it.

12
00:04:19,971 --> 00:04:21,056
We'll take it from here.

13
00:04:21,515 --> 00:04:22,682
Who the hell are you?

14
00:04:22,933 --> 00:04:24,226
INS, Division 6.

15
00:04:24,476 --> 00:04:26,811
Division 6?
I never heard of Division 6.

16
00:04:27,062 --> 00:04:28,104
Really?

17
00:04:29,105 --> 00:04:30,232
Who you betting on?

18
00:04:31,066 --> 00:04:32,400
Tough call, Kay.

19
00:05:08,937 --> 00:05:10,230
We've got a winner here.

20
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,898
Oh, I know.

21
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:19,864
Sir, you can't-

22
00:05:20,073 --> 00:05:21,658
Don't "sir" me, young man.

23
00:05:21,866 --> 00:05:24,661
You have no idea
who you're dealing with.

24
00:05:30,667 --> 00:05:33,086
We'll chat with our friend.
You hit the road.

25
00:05:34,671 --> 00:05:38,216
Keep on protecting us from
the dangerous aliens.

26
00:05:42,554 --> 00:05:44,472
You ever hear of Division 6?

27
00:05:44,723 --> 00:05:46,474
There is no Division 6.

28
00:05:46,725 --> 00:05:47,809
This is bullshit.

29
00:05:48,059 --> 00:05:49,185
Hell, yeah.

30
00:05:50,645 --> 00:05:53,815
Looks like you fell off the bus
in the wrong part of town.

31
00:05:54,065 --> 00:05:56,901
I'll bet you're not
from anywhere near here.

32
00:06:00,864 --> 00:06:02,198
Mikey?

33
00:06:09,456 --> 00:06:11,499
Mikey, when they let you out of jail?

34
00:06:13,043 --> 00:06:14,210
Political refugee.

35
00:06:14,461 --> 00:06:17,338
You know how many treaties
you just violated?

36
00:06:18,048 --> 00:06:19,841
- One?
- Try seven.

37
00:06:22,886 --> 00:06:24,554
You hand me that head.

38
00:06:30,226 --> 00:06:31,770
Put up your arms and flippers.

39
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:44,657
Shit!

40
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,497
Shoot him!

41
00:07:21,236 --> 00:07:22,779
- "That. "
- That...

42
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:28,785
Was not human. I know.
You got some entrails on you.

43
00:07:30,119 --> 00:07:31,079
What the hell?

44
00:07:31,329 --> 00:07:32,830
The situation's under control.

45
00:07:33,122 --> 00:07:35,250
Give me your attention for a moment.

46
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,418
I'll tell you what happened.

47
00:07:46,261 --> 00:07:50,848
This is called a neuralizer. It's
a gift from friends from out of town.

48
00:07:51,099 --> 00:07:52,934
This red eye isolates...

49
00:07:53,184 --> 00:07:56,229
...the brain's impulses,
specifically the ones for memory.

50
00:07:56,813 --> 00:07:59,023
Give me a splay burn on
the perimeter...

51
00:07:59,274 --> 00:08:01,442
...with holes at 40, 60,
and 80 metres...

52
00:08:01,818 --> 00:08:03,820
...from right here.
Thank you.

53
00:08:09,534 --> 00:08:10,368
That's good.

54
00:08:11,119 --> 00:08:12,370
What's going on?

55
00:08:12,662 --> 00:08:14,080
Excellent question.

56
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:16,958
The answer you're looking for
lies right here.

57
00:08:20,044 --> 00:08:21,879
Who are you, really?

58
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:22,964
Really?

59
00:08:24,048 --> 00:08:27,176
I am just a figment
of your imagination.

60
00:08:31,472 --> 00:08:33,516
Damn, what a gullible breed.

61
00:08:34,726 --> 00:08:38,229
I'm serious. You're lucky
to be alive after that blast.

62
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:39,314
What blast?

63
00:08:39,522 --> 00:08:41,065
The underground gas main.

64
00:08:41,316 --> 00:08:43,526
You should exercise caution
before firing...

65
00:08:43,776 --> 00:08:46,195
...I'll tell you that now.
Especially you.

66
00:08:47,739 --> 00:08:50,658
Have yourself checked out with EMS
before you leave.

67
00:09:03,504 --> 00:09:05,089
I'm sorry about back there.

68
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:06,591
It happens.

69
00:09:06,841 --> 00:09:08,343
Didn't used to.

70
00:09:10,386 --> 00:09:12,722
The spirit's willing, Kay...

71
00:09:14,057 --> 00:09:15,850
...but the rest of me...

72
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:20,730
They're beautiful, aren't they?

73
00:09:21,522 --> 00:09:23,066
The stars.

74
00:09:24,192 --> 00:09:26,235
We never just look anymore.

75
00:09:31,866 --> 00:09:33,534
I'll tell you, Kay...

76
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:36,579
...I will miss the chase.

77
00:09:41,876 --> 00:09:42,752
No, Dee...

78
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,088
...you won't.

79
00:09:46,923 --> 00:09:48,382
Freeze!

80
00:09:48,591 --> 00:09:50,760
NYPD! Freeze!

81
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:53,554
All yours, Edwards.

82
00:09:55,556 --> 00:09:57,141
Freeze means stop!

83
00:10:03,773 --> 00:10:05,274
What the hell?!

84
00:10:13,783 --> 00:10:16,619
It just be raining black people
in New York.

85
00:10:41,811 --> 00:10:43,354
Do you see this?

86
00:10:43,604 --> 00:10:45,565
N- Y-P-D!

87
00:10:45,773 --> 00:10:48,359
Means I will knock your punk-ass down!

88
00:10:48,609 --> 00:10:49,944
He's coming!

89
00:10:50,194 --> 00:10:52,989
Yeah, and when he gets here,
I'll arrest his ass too.

90
00:10:56,867 --> 00:10:59,161
You trying to catch a beat-down?

91
00:12:06,562 --> 00:12:07,730
What's up?

92
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,733
He's coming.

93
00:12:11,025 --> 00:12:13,819
He's coming because I failed.
Now he'll kill me.

94
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:16,364
You pissing everybody off today, huh?

95
00:12:18,199 --> 00:12:19,867
You don't understand.

96
00:12:20,117 --> 00:12:22,286
Your world's gonna end.

97
00:12:25,373 --> 00:12:26,540
What are you?

98
00:12:32,546 --> 00:12:34,840
Watch that ledge. Watch the ledge.

99
00:12:35,091 --> 00:12:38,385
Come on down. We'll get those
eyes fixed, don't worry.

100
00:12:38,636 --> 00:12:40,805
Wait a minute.
Let me talk to you!

101
00:12:48,437 --> 00:12:50,481
I work my butt off to make a living.

102
00:12:50,731 --> 00:12:54,026
All I want is to come home to
a fat steak on the table...

103
00:12:54,276 --> 00:12:56,529
...but instead I get this.
It looks like poison.

104
00:12:56,904 --> 00:13:01,033
Don't take that away! I'm eating that!
It is poison, isn't it?

105
00:13:01,283 --> 00:13:03,869
I swear, I wouldn't
be surprised if it was...

106
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:07,706
...the way you skulk like a dog
been hit too much, or not enough!

107
00:13:07,957 --> 00:13:09,208
I can't decide.

108
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:11,085
You're useless, Beatrice.

109
00:13:11,335 --> 00:13:15,464
The only thing that pulls its weight
around here is my goddamn truck!

110
00:13:25,683 --> 00:13:27,101
Figures.

111
00:13:36,151 --> 00:13:37,695
What the heck is it?

112
00:13:38,988 --> 00:13:41,115
Get your big butt back in the house.

113
00:13:53,711 --> 00:13:57,089
Place projectile weapon on the ground.

114
00:13:57,339 --> 00:13:59,049
You can have my gun...

115
00:13:59,258 --> 00:14:01,427
...when you pry it
from my dead fingers.

116
00:14:01,677 --> 00:14:04,013
Your proposal is acceptable.

117
00:14:46,347 --> 00:14:48,098
Edgar, what on earth was that?

118
00:14:48,349 --> 00:14:49,516
Sugar.

119
00:14:49,892 --> 00:14:52,227
I've never seen sugar do that.

120
00:14:53,395 --> 00:14:55,564
Give me sugar.

121
00:15:00,277 --> 00:15:01,570
In water.

122
00:15:08,035 --> 00:15:09,203
More.

123
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:13,916
More.

124
00:15:28,472 --> 00:15:30,557
Your skin is hanging off your bones.

125
00:15:42,319 --> 00:15:43,362
Is that better?

126
00:16:12,808 --> 00:16:15,435
"The perpetrator blinked
two sets of eyelids. "

127
00:16:15,686 --> 00:16:17,396
Blinked with both eyes?

128
00:16:17,604 --> 00:16:20,691
He blinked one set,
then a completely different set.

129
00:16:20,941 --> 00:16:23,443
You know, like high beams
and low beams.

130
00:16:24,611 --> 00:16:28,407
Was that before or after he drew
the weapon that you claim...

131
00:16:28,657 --> 00:16:30,784
...evaporated into a million pieces?

132
00:16:31,034 --> 00:16:32,661
After, sir.

133
00:16:33,537 --> 00:16:37,249
Why is it that no other officers saw
either of these events?

134
00:16:37,499 --> 00:16:40,085
Some of them are
soggy around the midsection.

135
00:16:40,335 --> 00:16:41,920
They weren't able to keep up.

136
00:16:42,129 --> 00:16:44,173
If you were half the man I am-

137
00:16:44,506 --> 00:16:46,967
I am half the man that you are.

138
00:16:47,217 --> 00:16:48,844
What is your problem?

139
00:16:49,094 --> 00:16:50,220
You're in my face.

140
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:52,973
- I think he threw him off the roof.
- You next.

141
00:16:53,181 --> 00:16:54,224
I wanna talk to you.

142
00:16:54,433 --> 00:16:57,144
Ten minutes,
you take your best shot, tough guy.

143
00:16:58,061 --> 00:17:01,732
Take 10 minutes on a StairMaster,
you pudgy bastard!

144
00:17:06,987 --> 00:17:09,489
I believe you. Laurel Weaver.
Deputy Medical Examiner.

145
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:11,825
Find me at the morgue. I'll show you.

146
00:17:12,034 --> 00:17:12,868
Wait.

147
00:17:13,201 --> 00:17:14,161
Wait a minute!

148
00:17:15,203 --> 00:17:19,416
You're Dr. Weaver with the coroner's
office working on the John Doe?

149
00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:22,169
- That's right.
- Will you look at this, please?

150
00:17:29,384 --> 00:17:30,844
Some night, huh?

151
00:17:31,178 --> 00:17:32,012
Some night.

152
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:34,181
They were gills, not eyelids.

153
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:37,559
Gills. He was out of breath.

154
00:17:38,393 --> 00:17:39,519
Who are you?

155
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:41,438
Did he say anything to you?

156
00:17:41,688 --> 00:17:43,649
He said the world was
coming to an end.

157
00:17:44,733 --> 00:17:46,109
Did he say when?

158
00:17:52,199 --> 00:17:54,951
Would you recognize his weapon
if you saw it again?

159
00:17:55,202 --> 00:17:56,578
Absolutely.

160
00:17:58,205 --> 00:17:59,873
Come on, let's take a ride.

161
00:18:00,123 --> 00:18:02,876
Wait a minute. Look, I got
tons of paperwork-

162
00:18:03,126 --> 00:18:04,002
It's all done.

163
00:18:04,252 --> 00:18:05,128
Good work.

164
00:18:05,379 --> 00:18:08,298
You really ran this dude down on foot?
That's tough.

165
00:18:08,548 --> 00:18:10,092
That's double tough.

166
00:18:20,018 --> 00:18:22,229
So who exactly are you with?

167
00:18:22,479 --> 00:18:24,648
FBl? NSA?

168
00:18:24,898 --> 00:18:29,444
I'm part of a bureau that licenses,
monitors and polices aliens on Earth.

169
00:18:29,695 --> 00:18:30,987
Yeah, whatever.

170
00:18:31,196 --> 00:18:32,447
We're here.

171
00:18:34,408 --> 00:18:36,118
This is where we're going?

172
00:18:36,868 --> 00:18:38,286
This is Jack Jeebs' spot.

173
00:18:38,495 --> 00:18:40,831
He buys from chain-snatchers.
Doesn't sell guns.

174
00:18:41,081 --> 00:18:42,124
Really?

175
00:18:42,749 --> 00:18:43,708
All right, look.

176
00:18:43,917 --> 00:18:48,046
I'm gonna go in and put my thing down,
but when I come out, I want answers.

177
00:18:48,296 --> 00:18:49,965
Okay, go put your thing down.

178
00:18:56,012 --> 00:18:57,472
Officer Eduardo!

179
00:18:57,722 --> 00:19:00,559
How did these get here?
I thought I turned them in.

180
00:19:00,809 --> 00:19:04,146
I hear you're into something hotter
than stolen Rolexes.

181
00:19:04,354 --> 00:19:07,107
I deal crack, but I still work here.
I love the hours.

182
00:19:07,566 --> 00:19:10,485
I'm talking about guns, smart-ass!
Weird ones.

183
00:19:11,111 --> 00:19:13,905
Come on!
What you see is what I got.

184
00:19:16,283 --> 00:19:17,826
Show him the imports, Jeebs.

185
00:19:18,952 --> 00:19:20,579
Hey, Kay. How are you?

186
00:19:20,829 --> 00:19:23,874
- Show him the imports.
- I got out of that business.

187
00:19:24,124 --> 00:19:25,625
Why do you lie to me?

188
00:19:26,126 --> 00:19:27,335
Hold on a second.

189
00:19:27,669 --> 00:19:28,753
I'll count to three.

190
00:19:29,004 --> 00:19:31,923
He'll do it, Jeebs.
That man does not look stable.

191
00:19:32,132 --> 00:19:34,801
You know what? He's crazy
when he's like this.

192
00:19:35,051 --> 00:19:37,012
He's always crazy.
Get a massage.

193
00:19:37,262 --> 00:19:38,138
Take a cruise-

194
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:41,224
- Drop the weapon.
- I warned him.

195
00:19:41,474 --> 00:19:42,309
Drop the weapon!

196
00:19:42,517 --> 00:19:43,810
- You warned him.
- I'll kill you.

197
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:47,189
You insensitive jerk!

198
00:19:50,984 --> 00:19:53,361
Do you have any idea
how much that stings?

199
00:19:53,737 --> 00:19:56,114
Show us the merchandise,
or you'll lose another head.

200
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:09,794
Mr. Edwards...

201
00:20:15,258 --> 00:20:17,218
There, the one in the middle.

202
00:20:20,388 --> 00:20:23,975
You sold a reverberating carbonizer
with mutate capacity...

203
00:20:24,225 --> 00:20:26,645
...to an unlicensed cephalopoid!
You piece of-

204
00:20:27,103 --> 00:20:28,396
He looked okay to me.

205
00:20:28,605 --> 00:20:30,523
It was for an assassination.
The target?

206
00:20:30,774 --> 00:20:31,691
I don't know.

207
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:33,777
- Goddamn it!
- I don't know!

208
00:20:35,236 --> 00:20:36,571
All that's confiscated.

209
00:20:36,821 --> 00:20:40,909
Be on the next transport off this rock,
or I shoot where it don't grow back.

210
00:20:44,996 --> 00:20:48,041
And I'm gonna be back
to talk about them Rolexes.

211
00:21:10,689 --> 00:21:12,857
Searching for a handle on the moment?

212
00:21:14,567 --> 00:21:16,069
I can't help you.

213
00:21:17,028 --> 00:21:18,613
The only comfort I can offer...

214
00:21:18,863 --> 00:21:22,200
...is my promise that tomorrow
you won't remember a thing.

215
00:21:22,742 --> 00:21:25,370
That's not exactly
some shit you forget.

216
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:27,080
Ever seen one of these?

217
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:33,044
She looks over to her husband...

218
00:21:33,294 --> 00:21:36,381
...then sets it down in her lap
and says:

219
00:21:36,589 --> 00:21:39,801
" Honey, this one's eating my popcorn. "

220
00:21:43,096 --> 00:21:44,139
Get it?

221
00:21:44,389 --> 00:21:45,724
This one's eating...

222
00:21:48,101 --> 00:21:50,228
Gotta go.
Thanks for the egg rolls.

223
00:21:50,478 --> 00:21:51,771
Wait a minute.

224
00:21:52,063 --> 00:21:52,897
Who are you?

225
00:21:53,148 --> 00:21:55,733
See what I mean about tequila?
You're very bright.

226
00:21:55,984 --> 00:21:57,735
But you need to lay off the sauce.

227
00:21:57,986 --> 00:22:00,238
I'll see you bright and early, 9:00.

228
00:22:00,488 --> 00:22:01,322
Be there...

229
00:22:02,115 --> 00:22:03,658
...or be square.

230
00:22:24,888 --> 00:22:26,431
Well, well, well.

231
00:22:26,681 --> 00:22:29,976
Moving right in, are we?
Think we own the place?

232
00:22:30,185 --> 00:22:32,103
I got an eviction notice for you.

233
00:22:32,353 --> 00:22:35,148
Just what exactly
do you think you're doing here?

234
00:22:35,398 --> 00:22:37,442
Taking care of your pest problem.

235
00:22:37,692 --> 00:22:39,027
Pest problem?

236
00:22:39,903 --> 00:22:41,112
Pest?

237
00:22:41,321 --> 00:22:43,323
You got a hell of an infestation.

238
00:22:43,531 --> 00:22:46,367
You know, I've noticed
an infestation here.

239
00:22:46,576 --> 00:22:49,370
Everywhere I look, nothing but
undeveloped, unevolved...

240
00:22:49,621 --> 00:22:52,123
...barely conscious pond scum...

241
00:22:52,332 --> 00:22:55,001
...totally convinced
of their own superiority...

242
00:22:55,251 --> 00:22:57,337
...as they scurry about their short...

243
00:22:57,587 --> 00:22:59,339
...pointless lives.

244
00:23:02,342 --> 00:23:04,177
Don't you wanna get rid of them?

245
00:23:04,427 --> 00:23:06,137
In the worst way.

246
00:23:41,965 --> 00:23:43,383
Help you?

247
00:23:43,758 --> 00:23:45,677
This dude gave me this card-

248
00:23:45,927 --> 00:23:47,220
Elevator.

249
00:24:11,953 --> 00:24:14,205
You're late. Sit down.

250
00:24:21,212 --> 00:24:22,672
My name is Zed.

251
00:24:23,089 --> 00:24:25,717
You're all here
because you're the best.

252
00:24:25,925 --> 00:24:30,513
Marines, Air Force, Navy SEALs,
Army Rangers, NYPD.

253
00:24:30,888 --> 00:24:32,056
We want one of you.

254
00:24:32,598 --> 00:24:33,725
Just one.

255
00:24:33,975 --> 00:24:36,728
What will follow is
a series of simple tests...

256
00:24:36,978 --> 00:24:40,523
...for motor skills,
concentration, stamina.

257
00:24:41,274 --> 00:24:42,692
I see we have a question.

258
00:24:42,942 --> 00:24:46,529
I'm sorry, maybe you
already answered this but...

259
00:24:46,779 --> 00:24:48,197
...why are we here?

260
00:24:48,448 --> 00:24:49,449
Son.

261
00:24:49,949 --> 00:24:52,869
Lieutenant Jensen.
West Point graduate with honours.

262
00:24:53,119 --> 00:24:56,748
We're here because you want
the best of the best of the best, sir!

263
00:25:02,336 --> 00:25:04,172
What's so funny, Edwards?

264
00:25:04,547 --> 00:25:06,632
Your boy, Captain America, here.

265
00:25:07,258 --> 00:25:09,802
"The best of the best
of the best, sir!"

266
00:25:10,136 --> 00:25:10,970
"With honours. "

267
00:25:11,804 --> 00:25:13,431
He's just really excited...

268
00:25:13,639 --> 00:25:15,725
...and has no clue why we're here.

269
00:25:15,975 --> 00:25:18,394
That's just very funny to me.

270
00:25:19,812 --> 00:25:21,481
Y'all ain't laughing, though.

271
00:25:29,322 --> 00:25:31,240
Okay, let's get going.

272
00:26:55,866 --> 00:26:57,118
Wanna get down on this?

273
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:24,729
Edwards, what happened?

274
00:27:25,771 --> 00:27:26,605
Hesitated.

275
00:27:29,442 --> 00:27:33,154
May I ask why you felt
little Tiffany deserved to die?

276
00:27:33,404 --> 00:27:35,781
She was the only one
that seemed dangerous.

277
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:37,408
How'd you figure that?

278
00:27:37,616 --> 00:27:40,327
I was gonna pop this guy
hanging from the light...

279
00:27:40,578 --> 00:27:42,163
...but he's just working out.

280
00:27:42,455 --> 00:27:46,125
How'd I feel if somebody bust
my ass while I'm on the treadmill?

281
00:27:46,375 --> 00:27:48,252
Then I saw this snarling beast.

282
00:27:48,502 --> 00:27:51,547
I noticed he had a tissue
in his hand and realized...

283
00:27:51,797 --> 00:27:53,841
...he's not snarling,
he's sneezing.

284
00:27:54,091 --> 00:27:55,426
Ain't no threat there.

285
00:27:55,676 --> 00:27:56,761
Then I saw Tiffany.

286
00:27:57,011 --> 00:27:59,930
8- year-old white girl,
middle of the ghetto...

287
00:28:00,181 --> 00:28:03,017
...bunch of monsters at night
with quantum physics books?

288
00:28:03,309 --> 00:28:05,102
She about to start some shit.

289
00:28:05,311 --> 00:28:07,855
Those books are
way too advanced for her.

290
00:28:08,105 --> 00:28:10,483
If you ask me, she's up to something.

291
00:28:10,775 --> 00:28:13,486
I'd appreciate it if you
eased up about it.

292
00:28:17,656 --> 00:28:19,658
Or do I owe her an apology?

293
00:28:27,291 --> 00:28:28,709
Good shot, though, right?

294
00:28:34,256 --> 00:28:36,175
He has a problem with authority.

295
00:28:36,425 --> 00:28:37,718
So do I.

296
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:41,180
But this kid ran down
a cephalopoid on foot, boss.

297
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:43,265
That's gotta be tough enough.

298
00:28:44,391 --> 00:28:46,602
Let's hope you know what you're doing.

299
00:28:55,027 --> 00:28:57,196
Gentlemen, congratulations.

300
00:28:57,404 --> 00:29:00,950
You're everything we expect
from years of government training.

301
00:29:01,158 --> 00:29:04,787
If you'll just follow me,
we have one more test to administer.

302
00:29:04,995 --> 00:29:06,664
An eye exam.

303
00:29:19,593 --> 00:29:20,886
Where are you going?

304
00:29:22,721 --> 00:29:24,223
What the hell is all this?

305
00:29:24,473 --> 00:29:27,601
In the 1950s, the government
started an underfunded agency...

306
00:29:27,851 --> 00:29:30,604
...with the laughable purpose
of establishing contact...

307
00:29:30,813 --> 00:29:32,606
...with a race not of this planet.

308
00:29:32,815 --> 00:29:34,984
Look at the end of this device.

309
00:29:35,317 --> 00:29:38,237
Everyone thought the agency
was a joke, except the aliens...

310
00:29:38,487 --> 00:29:41,573
...who made contact on March 2, 1961
outside New York.

311
00:29:41,824 --> 00:29:45,869
There were nine of us the first night.
Seven agents, one astronomer...

312
00:29:46,078 --> 00:29:48,247
...and a dumb kid who'd gotten lost.

313
00:29:48,497 --> 00:29:51,333
You brought that tall man some flowers.

314
00:29:51,959 --> 00:29:53,127
This way.

315
00:29:54,253 --> 00:29:56,588
They were a group
of intergalactic refugees.

316
00:29:56,839 --> 00:30:00,467
Wanted Earth as an apolitical zone
for creatures without a planet.

317
00:30:00,718 --> 00:30:02,261
You ever see Casablanca?

318
00:30:02,511 --> 00:30:04,179
Same thing, except no Nazis.

319
00:30:04,388 --> 00:30:07,725
We agreed and concealed
all evidence of their landing.

320
00:30:08,684 --> 00:30:12,813
So these are real flying saucers
and the World's Fair was a cover-up?

321
00:30:13,105 --> 00:30:14,231
Why hold it in Queens?

322
00:30:14,481 --> 00:30:17,401
More nonhumans arrive every year
and live among us in secret.

323
00:30:17,651 --> 00:30:22,406
Not to change the subject, but when
was the last time you got a CAT scan?

324
00:30:22,656 --> 00:30:26,326
- Six months ago. It's company policy.
- Make another appointment.

325
00:30:26,577 --> 00:30:29,788
Tell your boy Zed I had
an absolutely wonderful time...

326
00:30:30,039 --> 00:30:33,083
...and thank you for everything,
but show me the door.

327
00:30:33,333 --> 00:30:36,420
All right. I'm getting some coffee.
You want some?

328
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:38,464
No, thank you, I'm fine.

329
00:30:43,844 --> 00:30:44,887
How you doing?

330
00:30:45,137 --> 00:30:46,305
Hi, Kay.

331
00:30:47,514 --> 00:30:50,017
- That's not decaf, is it?
- Viennese cinnamon.

332
00:30:50,434 --> 00:30:54,354
Don't tell me we only got powdered
stuff for cream. I hate it.

333
00:30:56,315 --> 00:30:58,525
Well, that's good. Good. Good.

334
00:30:59,401 --> 00:31:01,111
You guys getting along all right?

335
00:31:02,738 --> 00:31:04,239
Don't work too hard.

336
00:31:08,077 --> 00:31:10,079
Sure you don't want some coffee?

337
00:31:16,543 --> 00:31:18,045
Here's the deal.

338
00:31:18,295 --> 00:31:21,632
At any given time, there are
around 1,500 aliens on the planet.

339
00:31:21,882 --> 00:31:23,842
Most of them here in Manhattan.

340
00:31:24,092 --> 00:31:26,970
Most of them are decent.
Just trying to make a living.

341
00:31:27,221 --> 00:31:29,681
- Cab drivers?
- Not as many as you'd think.

342
00:31:30,182 --> 00:31:33,310
Humans, for the most part,
don't have a clue. Don't want one.

343
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:38,023
They're happy. They think
they have a good bead on things.

344
00:31:38,899 --> 00:31:41,401
People are smart.
They can handle it.

345
00:31:41,735 --> 00:31:42,778
A person is smart.

346
00:31:43,111 --> 00:31:46,865
People are dumb, panicky,
dangerous animals, and you know it.

347
00:31:47,241 --> 00:31:50,369
1,500 years ago, everybody knew
the Earth was...

348
00:31:50,619 --> 00:31:52,329
...the centre of the universe.

349
00:31:52,579 --> 00:31:55,916
500 years ago, everybody knew
the Earth was flat.

350
00:31:56,166 --> 00:32:00,212
And 15 minutes ago, you knew that
people were alone on this planet.

351
00:32:02,297 --> 00:32:04,341
Imagine what you'll know...

352
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:05,717
...tomorrow.

353
00:32:08,136 --> 00:32:10,347
- What's the catch?
- The catch?

354
00:32:10,931 --> 00:32:13,433
The catch is, you will sever
all human contact.

355
00:32:13,684 --> 00:32:16,770
Nobody will ever know
you exist anywhere...

356
00:32:18,689 --> 00:32:19,731
...ever.

357
00:32:23,068 --> 00:32:25,571
I'll give you to sunrise
to think it over.

358
00:32:30,701 --> 00:32:32,035
Is it worth it?

359
00:32:32,286 --> 00:32:33,662
Yeah, it's worth it.

360
00:32:36,164 --> 00:32:37,791
If you're strong enough.

361
00:33:38,018 --> 00:33:39,394
What's up, pops?

362
00:33:49,988 --> 00:33:50,947
I'm in...

363
00:33:51,156 --> 00:33:54,493
...because there's some
next-level shit going on here.

364
00:33:54,701 --> 00:33:57,954
Before y'all beam me up,
there's a few things to understand.

365
00:33:58,205 --> 00:34:01,958
First off, you chose me,
so you recognize the skills.

366
00:34:02,209 --> 00:34:05,837
I don't want nobody calling me
"son" or " kid" or "sport. " Cool?

367
00:34:06,088 --> 00:34:07,339
Cool. Whatever, slick.

368
00:34:07,547 --> 00:34:10,801
But I need to tell you something
about all your skills.

369
00:34:12,094 --> 00:34:15,347
As of right now,
they mean precisely...

370
00:34:15,764 --> 00:34:17,057
...dick.

371
00:34:30,278 --> 00:34:32,781
- Purpose of trip?
- Diplomatic mission.

372
00:34:33,031 --> 00:34:33,949
Duration of stay?

373
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:35,492
Lunch.

374
00:34:35,742 --> 00:34:37,577
Any fruits or vegetables?

375
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:52,551
You wanna stay away from that guy.

376
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,178
He's grouchy.

377
00:34:55,595 --> 00:34:58,557
Three hours in customs
after a 17-trillion-mile trip...

378
00:34:58,765 --> 00:35:00,267
...will make anyone cranky.

379
00:35:00,475 --> 00:35:02,394
What government branch
do we report to?

380
00:35:02,644 --> 00:35:05,230
- None. They ask too many questions.
- Who pays for this?

381
00:35:05,438 --> 00:35:09,901
We hold patents on a few gadgets we
confiscated from out-of-state visitors.

382
00:35:10,151 --> 00:35:12,320
Velcro, microwave ovens, liposuction.

383
00:35:12,529 --> 00:35:14,406
This is a fascinating gadget.

384
00:35:14,948 --> 00:35:18,493
It'll replace CDs soon. I'll have to
buy the White Album again.

385
00:35:18,743 --> 00:35:22,873
That's fun. A universal translator.
We're not even supposed to have it.

386
00:35:23,123 --> 00:35:25,709
Human thought is so primitive.
It's looked upon...

387
00:35:25,959 --> 00:35:28,503
...as an infectious disease
in some galaxies.

388
00:35:28,753 --> 00:35:30,589
That kind of makes you proud.

389
00:35:30,839 --> 00:35:31,923
What's this?

390
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,012
Just be calm!

391
00:35:37,262 --> 00:35:38,305
Relax!

392
00:35:39,014 --> 00:35:40,348
Watch your head!

393
00:35:40,849 --> 00:35:42,559
Someone get him some ice!

394
00:35:43,393 --> 00:35:46,521
Look out! Move! Just move
when it's coming at you!

395
00:35:52,736 --> 00:35:53,570
Damn!

396
00:35:54,321 --> 00:35:55,905
I'll pay for that!

397
00:36:07,208 --> 00:36:10,337
This thing caused
the 1977 New York blackout.

398
00:36:11,296 --> 00:36:13,423
Practical joke
by the Great Attractor.

399
00:36:13,673 --> 00:36:15,300
He thought it was funny.

400
00:36:16,676 --> 00:36:17,969
Sorry, y'all.

401
00:36:18,636 --> 00:36:20,764
It was a accident. Sorry.

402
00:36:21,306 --> 00:36:23,391
Observation,
the heart of our endeavour.

403
00:36:23,641 --> 00:36:25,810
Meet the twins, Blblup and Bob.

404
00:36:26,061 --> 00:36:29,397
This map shows the location
of every alien on Earth.

405
00:36:29,647 --> 00:36:31,649
Some are under constant surveillance.

406
00:36:32,025 --> 00:36:34,110
Everyone on those screens is an alien.

407
00:36:34,361 --> 00:36:37,238
In public, they're as normal
as you are, but in private...

408
00:36:37,822 --> 00:36:38,823
You'll get the idea.

409
00:36:40,033 --> 00:36:41,409
Oh, man.

410
00:36:41,868 --> 00:36:43,495
Doesn't make any sense, right?

411
00:36:44,704 --> 00:36:47,374
Well, no, it makes perfect sense.

412
00:36:47,916 --> 00:36:51,211
In third grade, everyone said
I was crazy, but I knew our teacher...

413
00:36:51,419 --> 00:36:53,671
...had to be from Venus or something.

414
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:56,633
Ms. Edelson. Jupiter, actually.
Well, one of the moons.

415
00:36:58,051 --> 00:36:58,927
revolve.

416
00:36:59,177 --> 00:37:00,512
Class...

417
00:37:00,970 --> 00:37:03,348
...be quiet and pay attention!

418
00:37:04,307 --> 00:37:05,934
If I have to tell you...

419
00:37:06,142 --> 00:37:08,520
...one more time...

420
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:11,439
Let's put it on.

421
00:37:12,273 --> 00:37:13,108
Put what on?

422
00:37:13,733 --> 00:37:16,236
The last suit you'll ever wear.

423
00:37:28,748 --> 00:37:31,459
You will dress only in attire
specially sanctioned...

424
00:37:31,709 --> 00:37:33,711
...by MiB Special Services.

425
00:37:34,212 --> 00:37:37,006
You'll conform to
the identity we give you...

426
00:37:37,257 --> 00:37:40,051
...eat where we tell you,
live where we tell you.

427
00:37:40,677 --> 00:37:41,636
From now on...

428
00:37:41,886 --> 00:37:44,389
...you'll have no identifying
marks of any kind.

429
00:37:44,639 --> 00:37:47,267
You will not stand out in any way.

430
00:37:47,684 --> 00:37:49,561
Your entire image is crafted...

431
00:37:49,811 --> 00:37:52,730
...to leave no lasting memory
with anyone you meet.

432
00:37:53,064 --> 00:37:55,483
You are a rumour,
recognizable only as...

433
00:37:55,692 --> 00:37:58,570
...déja vu and dismissed
just as quickly.

434
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:01,155
You don't exist.
You were never born.

435
00:38:03,908 --> 00:38:05,869
Anonymity is your name.

436
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:07,996
Silence, your native tongue.

437
00:38:08,788 --> 00:38:11,082
You're no longer part of the system.

438
00:38:11,291 --> 00:38:13,459
You are above the system. Over it.

439
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,503
Beyond it.

440
00:38:16,671 --> 00:38:18,840
We're "them. " We're "they. "

441
00:38:19,215 --> 00:38:21,676
We are the Men in Black.

442
00:38:29,017 --> 00:38:32,103
You know what the difference is
between you and me?

443
00:38:34,647 --> 00:38:36,608
I make this look good.

444
00:38:38,776 --> 00:38:40,737
We're gonna go for a little ride.

445
00:38:41,154 --> 00:38:44,824
I'll put you down here for a minute,
and Daddy will be right back.

446
00:39:16,272 --> 00:39:19,150
Okay, now we're ready to go
for a little ride.

447
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:22,987
We'll meet one of Daddy's friends,
and you'll like him.

448
00:39:26,032 --> 00:39:27,992
Okay, let's see.

449
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:32,121
Bee, we got the deposed sur-prefect
of Singalee...

450
00:39:32,372 --> 00:39:35,291
...touching down in the forest
outside Portland tonight.

451
00:39:35,541 --> 00:39:38,169
- Humanoid?
- You wish. Bring a sponge.

452
00:39:39,379 --> 00:39:41,464
Here. Red letter from last night.

453
00:39:42,173 --> 00:39:45,134
We had an unauthorized landing
in upstate New York.

454
00:39:45,385 --> 00:39:47,387
Keep your ears open
on this one.

455
00:39:47,595 --> 00:39:51,015
We're not hosting an
intergalactic kegger down here.

456
00:39:52,892 --> 00:39:54,352
We got a skimmer.

457
00:39:54,727 --> 00:39:56,646
Landed alien out of zone.
Who is it?

458
00:39:56,896 --> 00:39:57,939
Redgick.

459
00:39:58,189 --> 00:40:01,192
He's not cleared to leave Manhattan,
but he's out of town...

460
00:40:01,442 --> 00:40:03,486
...stuck on the New Jersey turnpike.

461
00:40:03,736 --> 00:40:05,446
Take junior with you.

462
00:40:05,696 --> 00:40:08,491
This is a good one
for him to warm up on.

463
00:40:09,075 --> 00:40:10,076
Go get him, tiger.

464
00:40:17,041 --> 00:40:19,710
"We're not hosting
an intergalactic kegger. "

465
00:40:21,045 --> 00:40:22,255
Zed...

466
00:40:23,214 --> 00:40:24,382
He just...

467
00:40:25,967 --> 00:40:29,929
Unlimited technology from the
whole universe, and we cruise around...

468
00:40:30,138 --> 00:40:31,597
...in a Ford POS.

469
00:40:34,142 --> 00:40:35,977
Fasten your seat belt.

470
00:40:36,227 --> 00:40:38,062
We gotta work on your people skills.

471
00:40:38,312 --> 00:40:41,023
You'd get a better reaction
if you were polite.

472
00:40:41,274 --> 00:40:42,900
Fasten your seat belt, please.

473
00:40:43,109 --> 00:40:44,735
Good. Did you hurt yourself?

474
00:40:48,573 --> 00:40:52,243
The red button there, kid.
Don't ever touch the red button.

475
00:41:02,253 --> 00:41:04,922
All right, pop,
that'll be $72 there.

476
00:41:05,548 --> 00:41:08,759
Okay, sweetie, let me pay
the impolite driver.

477
00:42:11,864 --> 00:42:13,366
Six is up!

478
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:15,743
Where is Ivan?

479
00:42:15,993 --> 00:42:17,495
Gave him a break.

480
00:42:40,726 --> 00:42:43,771
You can kill us both,
but you will not find the Galaxy.

481
00:42:44,730 --> 00:42:46,899
You're right about one thing.

482
00:43:01,288 --> 00:43:02,915
You're not going anywhere.

483
00:43:19,932 --> 00:43:22,101
Your licence and registration, please.

484
00:43:25,813 --> 00:43:28,941
Like to see your other licence
and registration, please.

485
00:43:35,948 --> 00:43:39,785
You're restricted to Manhattan.
Where are you going, Redgie?

486
00:43:40,578 --> 00:43:43,122
It's my wife. She's...
Well, look.

487
00:43:47,918 --> 00:43:49,086
No big deal.

488
00:43:49,336 --> 00:43:51,463
Okay, you come with me, Redge.

489
00:43:53,632 --> 00:43:55,718
And you handle this.

490
00:43:55,968 --> 00:43:56,844
What?! Me?

491
00:43:57,595 --> 00:43:59,972
- You just catch.
- Does he know what he's doing?

492
00:44:00,181 --> 00:44:02,266
He does it all the time.
Let him work.

493
00:44:10,983 --> 00:44:12,735
Damn, man!

494
00:44:13,569 --> 00:44:16,238
Something's peeking!

495
00:44:16,488 --> 00:44:18,449
You're headed out of town.

496
00:44:18,699 --> 00:44:20,993
- We're meeting someone.
- Who?

497
00:44:21,243 --> 00:44:24,246
- It's a ship.
- I saw no departure clearance.

498
00:44:24,496 --> 00:44:25,372
You didn't?

499
00:44:25,623 --> 00:44:27,875
It's an emergency.

500
00:44:28,459 --> 00:44:29,793
You're doing fine!

501
00:44:30,002 --> 00:44:34,131
What kind of emergency?
What's the rush to get off the planet?

502
00:44:34,465 --> 00:44:36,634
We don't like
the neighbourhood anymore.

503
00:44:36,884 --> 00:44:38,719
Some of the new arrivals...

504
00:44:38,969 --> 00:44:42,306
New arrivals? Have anything to do
with the crasher last night?

505
00:44:42,514 --> 00:44:43,891
Excuse me, miss!

506
00:44:47,561 --> 00:44:49,021
Oh, man.

507
00:44:49,605 --> 00:44:51,315
Oh, man!

508
00:44:53,359 --> 00:44:54,276
Look.

509
00:44:54,526 --> 00:44:56,320
Oh, man!

510
00:44:57,863 --> 00:45:00,032
Congratulations, Redge.
It's a...

511
00:45:00,908 --> 00:45:02,284
...squid.

512
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:06,580
You know, it's...

513
00:45:07,581 --> 00:45:09,500
...actually kind of...

514
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:17,007
...cute.

515
00:45:24,890 --> 00:45:27,059
Anything about that seem unusual?

516
00:45:29,687 --> 00:45:31,271
What would scare Redgick so badly...

517
00:45:31,522 --> 00:45:33,982
...that he'd risk a warp jump
with a newborn?

518
00:45:34,441 --> 00:45:36,360
We'll check the hot sheets.

519
00:45:41,990 --> 00:45:43,200
These are " hot sheets"?

520
00:45:43,409 --> 00:45:45,452
Best investigative reporting on Earth.

521
00:45:45,703 --> 00:45:48,789
Read The New York Times if you want.
They get lucky sometimes.

522
00:45:49,164 --> 00:45:52,876
Cannot believe you're looking for tips
in the supermarket tabloids.

523
00:45:54,378 --> 00:45:55,879
Not " looking for. "

524
00:45:56,755 --> 00:45:59,425
Found.

525
00:46:12,146 --> 00:46:14,523
- Wait a minute, slow down.
- Why?

526
00:46:14,773 --> 00:46:17,985
Give her time to get the wrong
impression. Makes it smoother.

527
00:46:19,111 --> 00:46:20,529
Can I help you?

528
00:46:20,779 --> 00:46:24,074
Yes, ma'am. I'm Agent Manheim,
this is Agent Black, FBl.

529
00:46:24,324 --> 00:46:26,034
We'd like to talk about your visitor.

530
00:46:26,285 --> 00:46:27,703
Gonna make fun of me too?

531
00:46:27,953 --> 00:46:32,040
No, we do not have a sense of humour
we're aware of. May we come in?

532
00:46:33,792 --> 00:46:34,668
Sure.

533
00:46:35,127 --> 00:46:36,336
- Thank you.
- Lemonade?

534
00:46:36,587 --> 00:46:38,005
Oh, yes, please.

535
00:46:42,634 --> 00:46:45,053
The chief of police came
to the house...

536
00:46:45,304 --> 00:46:47,264
...and did an investigation.

537
00:46:47,764 --> 00:46:50,893
Took a police report and writ down
everything I said...

538
00:46:51,143 --> 00:46:52,936
...not believing one thing I said.

539
00:46:53,187 --> 00:46:54,897
Sort of poking fun at me.

540
00:46:55,147 --> 00:46:57,232
He asked me, " If he was murdered...

541
00:46:57,483 --> 00:46:59,902
...how was he able to walk
back in the house?"

542
00:47:00,152 --> 00:47:02,988
I gotta admit to you that
that one got me stumped.

543
00:47:03,405 --> 00:47:05,949
I tell you, I know Edgar,
and that wasn't Edgar.

544
00:47:07,493 --> 00:47:10,454
It was like something was
wearing Edgar.

545
00:47:12,456 --> 00:47:13,707
Like a suit...

546
00:47:14,333 --> 00:47:15,751
...an Edgar suit.

547
00:47:23,342 --> 00:47:26,053
Dude was that ugly
before he was an alien.

548
00:47:28,972 --> 00:47:30,807
I'm sorry.

549
00:47:31,183 --> 00:47:32,226
Go on.

550
00:47:33,227 --> 00:47:34,394
Anyway...

551
00:47:34,645 --> 00:47:36,688
...I come to and he's gone.

552
00:47:37,731 --> 00:47:38,690
He say anything?

553
00:47:39,024 --> 00:47:41,860
Yes. He asked me for some water.

554
00:47:42,486 --> 00:47:44,321
Some sugar water.

555
00:47:44,696 --> 00:47:45,781
Sugar water?

556
00:47:46,031 --> 00:47:49,034
I remember that right.
I thought that that was odd...

557
00:47:49,409 --> 00:47:53,497
...that he asked me for sugar water
and not lemonade or ice water...

558
00:47:53,914 --> 00:47:55,165
...or regular water...

559
00:47:55,415 --> 00:47:56,667
...tap water.

560
00:47:57,751 --> 00:48:00,420
All right, Beatrice.
There was no alien.

561
00:48:00,671 --> 00:48:02,965
The flash of light was not a U.F.O.

562
00:48:03,215 --> 00:48:07,511
Gas was trapped in a thermal pocket
and refracted the light from Venus.

563
00:48:07,761 --> 00:48:09,012
Wait a minute.

564
00:48:09,262 --> 00:48:12,683
That thing erases her memory,
and you just make up a new one?

565
00:48:12,933 --> 00:48:14,559
A standard-issue neuralizer.

566
00:48:14,810 --> 00:48:17,521
That weak-ass story is
the best you came up with?

567
00:48:17,854 --> 00:48:20,399
All right. On a more personal note...

568
00:48:20,649 --> 00:48:24,653
...Edgar ran off with an old girlfriend.
You'll stay with your mama...

569
00:48:24,903 --> 00:48:26,279
...and decide you're better off.

570
00:48:26,530 --> 00:48:30,200
Yeah, because he never
appreciated you anyway.

571
00:48:30,784 --> 00:48:32,703
In fact, you know what?

572
00:48:32,953 --> 00:48:35,664
You kicked him out.
And now that he's gone...

573
00:48:35,914 --> 00:48:39,042
...you'll go in town,
find yourself some nice dresses.

574
00:48:39,292 --> 00:48:43,338
Get yourself some shoes.
Find somewhere you could get a facial.

575
00:48:44,923 --> 00:48:48,218
And hire a decorator to come
in here quick because... damn!

576
00:48:56,351 --> 00:48:58,145
When do I get my own flashy...

577
00:48:58,395 --> 00:48:59,771
...memory messer-upper?

578
00:49:00,021 --> 00:49:01,022
When you grow up.

579
00:49:05,152 --> 00:49:06,111
Please. Not green.

580
00:49:07,612 --> 00:49:08,572
Oh, damn!

581
00:49:10,323 --> 00:49:13,160
Do you know which alien leaves
a green spectral trail...

582
00:49:13,410 --> 00:49:14,745
...and craves sugar water?

583
00:49:15,746 --> 00:49:19,583
That was on Jeopardy last night.
Damn, Alex said it was...

584
00:49:19,833 --> 00:49:21,668
Zed, we have a bug.

585
00:49:22,377 --> 00:49:25,130
So...
What? We don't like bugs?

586
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:27,549
Bugs thrive on carnage, tiger.

587
00:49:28,008 --> 00:49:32,345
They consume, infest, destroy,
live off the death of other species.

588
00:49:32,596 --> 00:49:34,639
You were stung as a child, right?

589
00:49:35,265 --> 00:49:38,894
Imagine a giant cockroach
with unlimited strength...

590
00:49:39,144 --> 00:49:42,731
...a massive inferiority complex,
and a real short temper...

591
00:49:42,939 --> 00:49:46,234
...is terrorizing Manhattan Island
in a new Edgar suit.

592
00:49:47,402 --> 00:49:48,528
That sound like fun?

593
00:49:50,947 --> 00:49:52,032
What's the move?

594
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:55,660
With a bug in town,
we'll watch the morgues.

595
00:50:08,006 --> 00:50:09,841
Where do you want
contestant number 3?

596
00:50:10,050 --> 00:50:11,551
Just leave it there.

597
00:50:11,801 --> 00:50:12,886
What's with the cat?

598
00:50:13,136 --> 00:50:16,181
There's a problem with the cat.
Sign here.

599
00:50:16,431 --> 00:50:19,226
- What's the problem with the cat?
- It's your problem.

600
00:50:22,562 --> 00:50:24,105
I hate the living.

601
00:50:26,107 --> 00:50:27,484
Shall we?

602
00:50:57,138 --> 00:50:59,015
Oh, my God!

603
00:51:03,103 --> 00:51:05,105
Buddy, what are you?

604
00:51:13,488 --> 00:51:16,741
Subject was approximately 112 degrees
at time of autopsy...

605
00:51:16,992 --> 00:51:19,160
...indicating a temperature increase.

606
00:51:19,411 --> 00:51:23,540
Examiner tried to verify this rectally,
but the subject had no rectum.

607
00:51:23,790 --> 00:51:25,208
Which is really-

608
00:51:25,458 --> 00:51:26,334
Weird.

609
00:51:27,210 --> 00:51:31,381
I'm Dr. Leo Manville, Department
of Public Health. This is Dr. White.

610
00:51:32,424 --> 00:51:34,467
You must not have a home life.

611
00:51:34,676 --> 00:51:37,929
We watch the morgues carefully.
You have something unusual?

612
00:51:38,179 --> 00:51:40,473
I'd say so. Triple homicide.

613
00:51:40,724 --> 00:51:43,893
The first body was normal,
except he was broken in half.

614
00:51:44,144 --> 00:51:46,646
But when I opened up
the other two, well...

615
00:51:46,896 --> 00:51:47,856
Let me show you.

616
00:51:54,779 --> 00:51:57,907
There's a skeletal structure
unlike anything I've seen.

617
00:51:58,158 --> 00:51:59,617
I'll have a look at it.

618
00:51:59,826 --> 00:52:02,037
You and Dr. Weaver
check the other body.

619
00:52:02,245 --> 00:52:03,621
This way, doctor.

620
00:52:04,330 --> 00:52:06,207
This one's even stranger.

621
00:52:07,125 --> 00:52:09,794
I did a laparotomy.
I started with the stomach.

622
00:52:10,045 --> 00:52:13,506
But we can start with the
gastroesophageal junction.

623
00:52:14,632 --> 00:52:17,552
Let's start wherever you started at.

624
00:52:18,011 --> 00:52:19,345
Okey-dokey.

625
00:52:28,062 --> 00:52:29,647
- Is this your cat?
- It is now.

626
00:52:29,856 --> 00:52:32,233
It came in with the body.
Dive right in.

627
00:52:32,442 --> 00:52:34,152
I'm sure he won't mind.

628
00:52:37,781 --> 00:52:39,657
You have really pretty eyes.

629
00:52:40,658 --> 00:52:41,659
Thank you.

630
00:52:45,830 --> 00:52:46,623
Feel that?

631
00:52:46,873 --> 00:52:50,001
Where the pyloric junction would be?
Push it aside.

632
00:52:50,418 --> 00:52:53,379
Notice anything strange?
Stomach, liver, lungs...

633
00:52:53,797 --> 00:52:55,715
Nope, all fine.

634
00:52:56,049 --> 00:52:57,467
They're all missing.

635
00:52:58,218 --> 00:52:59,177
Of course.

636
00:52:59,385 --> 00:53:02,305
That's obviously
the first thing I noticed.

637
00:53:02,889 --> 00:53:05,809
What I was pointing out
is the fact that there are no...

638
00:53:07,060 --> 00:53:08,353
...pieces...

639
00:53:08,603 --> 00:53:10,104
...of them left.

640
00:53:10,438 --> 00:53:13,441
You know, so they're intact...

641
00:53:13,816 --> 00:53:16,986
...wherever they are whole.
That we can be sure of.

642
00:53:17,153 --> 00:53:18,613
Have we met before?

643
00:53:19,489 --> 00:53:21,574
I'm having a feeling of deja vu.

644
00:53:22,992 --> 00:53:25,453
- Yeah, me too.
- Really?

645
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:28,623
Wanna know what I think?
Don't tell him.

646
00:53:28,873 --> 00:53:32,168
He's under enough stress.
I don't think it's a real body.

647
00:53:32,502 --> 00:53:35,880
I think it's some kind of
transport unit for something else.

648
00:53:36,089 --> 00:53:37,966
The question is, what?

649
00:53:38,758 --> 00:53:40,343
Is this freaking you out?

650
00:53:43,388 --> 00:53:44,514
No, girl.

651
00:53:46,057 --> 00:53:49,102
You know what I like to do sometimes
when it's late?

652
00:53:53,356 --> 00:53:54,691
Dr. White.

653
00:53:56,484 --> 00:53:57,819
Excuse me.

654
00:54:02,532 --> 00:54:03,700
What do you think?

655
00:54:04,242 --> 00:54:07,453
Interesting. She got
a "Queen of the Undead" thing going-

656
00:54:07,745 --> 00:54:08,997
Of the body.

657
00:54:09,247 --> 00:54:10,039
Great body.

658
00:54:10,290 --> 00:54:11,916
The dead body.

659
00:54:12,792 --> 00:54:14,752
You have to look at that thing.

660
00:54:15,044 --> 00:54:16,546
You recognize him?

661
00:54:17,130 --> 00:54:20,717
He looks like the big guy I saw
at headquarters, only deader.

662
00:54:20,925 --> 00:54:22,260
What killed him?

663
00:54:23,594 --> 00:54:24,554
A bug?

664
00:54:25,388 --> 00:54:26,723
You're up, slugger.

665
00:54:30,685 --> 00:54:31,936
Look at this.

666
00:54:33,730 --> 00:54:35,148
What the hell is that?

667
00:54:53,750 --> 00:54:55,126
Must...

668
00:54:56,753 --> 00:54:58,713
To prevent...

669
00:55:01,215 --> 00:55:03,134
...contest.

670
00:55:04,177 --> 00:55:05,636
What are you saying?

671
00:55:05,970 --> 00:55:07,305
To prevent...

672
00:55:07,638 --> 00:55:09,098
To prevent...

673
00:55:09,390 --> 00:55:10,433
...struggle?

674
00:55:12,852 --> 00:55:13,895
To prevent...

675
00:55:14,353 --> 00:55:15,354
War?

676
00:55:15,772 --> 00:55:16,856
War.

677
00:55:19,525 --> 00:55:21,027
The Galaxy...

678
00:55:22,403 --> 00:55:24,155
...is on...

679
00:55:24,614 --> 00:55:26,491
...Orion's...

680
00:55:28,951 --> 00:55:29,827
...be-

681
00:55:32,747 --> 00:55:34,165
What is word?

682
00:55:34,832 --> 00:55:36,209
The bed?

683
00:55:36,667 --> 00:55:38,711
Belt? Orion's belt?

684
00:55:58,898 --> 00:56:02,318
"To prevent war, the Galaxy
is on Orion's belt. "

685
00:56:02,568 --> 00:56:04,529
What the hell does that mean?

686
00:56:07,949 --> 00:56:09,450
Doctor...

687
00:56:09,617 --> 00:56:11,035
...whatever, come here.

688
00:56:11,244 --> 00:56:15,248
Dr. Whatever? You guys aren't really
from the Department of Health.

689
00:56:15,581 --> 00:56:17,333
Rosenberg. Damn!

690
00:56:17,667 --> 00:56:21,963
The Arquillians won't like this.
He was one of the royal family.

691
00:56:22,255 --> 00:56:23,548
This is an alien...

692
00:56:23,756 --> 00:56:27,051
...and you're from a government agency
keeping it under wraps.

693
00:56:27,301 --> 00:56:30,471
He said, "To prevent war,
the Galaxy is on Orion's belt. "

694
00:56:30,721 --> 00:56:32,932
How else do you explain New York?

695
00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:35,518
I was in this cab, and this guy was-

696
00:56:37,395 --> 00:56:39,564
"Galaxy on Orion's belt"
makes no sense.

697
00:56:39,814 --> 00:56:43,734
That's what the little dude inside
the big dude's head said, right?

698
00:56:43,985 --> 00:56:46,862
Damn, man!
You did the flashy thing already.

699
00:56:47,113 --> 00:56:49,657
Whoever you are,
you'll have to show me I.D.

700
00:56:49,991 --> 00:56:53,035
Of course, young lady.
Look at this for me, please.

701
00:56:53,244 --> 00:56:55,121
- Would you stop that?
- What?

702
00:56:55,329 --> 00:56:57,415
That thing will give her brain cancer.

703
00:56:57,707 --> 00:56:59,917
Never hurt her before.
Close the doors.

704
00:57:00,251 --> 00:57:02,003
Special Services will be here.

705
00:57:02,169 --> 00:57:05,131
How many times have you
flashy-thinged that woman?

706
00:57:05,298 --> 00:57:06,173
Couple.

707
00:57:06,507 --> 00:57:09,677
- Don't you worry about long-term damage?
- A little.

708
00:57:09,885 --> 00:57:11,887
- Have you flashy-thinged me?
- No.

709
00:57:12,096 --> 00:57:14,640
I ain't playing with you! Have you?

710
00:57:24,233 --> 00:57:27,194
I think I should be in charge
of the flashy thing.

711
00:57:27,528 --> 00:57:28,904
Not while I'm around.

712
00:57:29,238 --> 00:57:31,365
You'll fricassee someone's brain.

713
00:57:31,574 --> 00:57:35,703
We got two dead aliens and
a medical examiner needs a new memory.

714
00:57:38,164 --> 00:57:40,583
Make it a happy memory.

715
00:58:13,866 --> 00:58:15,951
Where is it?!

716
00:58:59,745 --> 00:59:01,205
Hey, Zed.

717
00:59:01,705 --> 00:59:04,500
Doesn't anybody ever get
any sleep around here?

718
00:59:04,708 --> 00:59:08,671
The twins keep us on Centurian time.
It's a 37-hour day.

719
00:59:08,879 --> 00:59:11,090
Give it a few months.
You'll get used to it.

720
00:59:11,423 --> 00:59:12,925
Or have a psychotic episode.

721
00:59:13,509 --> 00:59:14,593
Here's Orion.

722
00:59:14,802 --> 00:59:17,888
It's a grouping of the brightest stars
in the northern sky.

723
00:59:18,055 --> 00:59:20,683
- Here's Orion's belt.
- The little guy said:

724
00:59:20,850 --> 00:59:24,186
"To prevent war, the Galaxy
is on Orion's belt. "

725
00:59:24,520 --> 00:59:26,730
There are no galaxies
on Orion's belt.

726
00:59:27,064 --> 00:59:30,651
The belt is just these three stars.
Galaxies are huge.

727
00:59:30,901 --> 00:59:35,072
They're made up of billions of stars.
You heard wrong.

728
00:59:35,865 --> 00:59:38,409
Look, whatever, I know what I heard.

729
01:00:15,487 --> 01:00:16,905
Pretty lady.

730
01:00:23,370 --> 01:00:27,916
That grumpy guy's story's starting to
come into focus a little bit here.

731
01:00:28,584 --> 01:00:31,754
So you were the guy in that picture
with the flowers?

732
01:00:32,755 --> 01:00:36,091
And, I take it,
she never got those flowers.

733
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:39,720
So, what, she ever get married
or anything?

734
01:00:40,888 --> 01:00:43,766
They say it's better to have
loved and lost...

735
01:00:44,016 --> 01:00:46,185
...than never to have loved at all.

736
01:00:46,352 --> 01:00:47,561
Try it.

737
01:00:53,150 --> 01:00:54,318
Look at this.

738
01:00:54,526 --> 01:00:55,944
They're all leaving.

739
01:00:56,278 --> 01:01:00,115
We've had 12 jumps in the last hour.
Redgick was just the first.

740
01:01:01,116 --> 01:01:02,868
What do they know that we don't?

741
01:01:03,035 --> 01:01:04,620
Why does a rat desert a ship?

742
01:01:04,870 --> 01:01:08,665
Give me Lem Sat 4, please,
with a proton induction thermoscan.

743
01:01:10,501 --> 01:01:12,753
Thank you. Okay. Lem Sat 18.

744
01:01:14,838 --> 01:01:16,090
All right, 4000.

745
01:01:20,511 --> 01:01:21,970
An Arquillian battle cruiser.

746
01:01:22,137 --> 01:01:24,890
And we've got
a dead Arquillian prince.

747
01:01:26,642 --> 01:01:28,227
Speak of the devil.

748
01:01:29,269 --> 01:01:30,104
They sound pissed.

749
01:01:30,354 --> 01:01:31,855
Translate that. Step on it.

750
01:01:32,189 --> 01:01:35,734
Go to Rosenberg's jewellery store,
and see what you can turn up.

751
01:01:41,615 --> 01:01:42,908
Give the kid a weapon.

752
01:01:52,835 --> 01:01:56,004
- Series 4 De-atomizer.
- That's what I'm talking about.

753
01:01:56,213 --> 01:01:57,923
Noisy Cricket.

754
01:02:00,008 --> 01:02:01,969
Kay, no, no, come on, man.

755
01:02:02,261 --> 01:02:04,721
You get a Series 4 De-atomizer...

756
01:02:04,972 --> 01:02:06,890
...I get a little midget Cricket?

757
01:02:10,811 --> 01:02:12,813
Feel like I'm gonna break it.

758
01:02:57,232 --> 01:02:59,568
Hey, this is my truck!

759
01:03:00,611 --> 01:03:03,739
Make sure you tell them that
down at the impound.

760
01:03:11,038 --> 01:03:12,998
Please.

761
01:03:22,507 --> 01:03:24,843
Who breaks into a jewellery store
and leaves the jewels?

762
01:03:25,218 --> 01:03:27,304
Somebody not looking for jewellery.

763
01:03:29,556 --> 01:03:32,059
This guy had a serious crush
on his cat.

764
01:03:34,645 --> 01:03:35,646
Get down!

765
01:03:40,901 --> 01:03:41,943
Man!

766
01:03:43,862 --> 01:03:45,697
That's him. That's the bug!

767
01:03:45,947 --> 01:03:47,282
In the Edgar suit!

768
01:04:09,012 --> 01:04:11,765
We do not discharge our weapons
in view of the public!

769
01:04:12,015 --> 01:04:14,017
We ain't got time for this bullshit!

770
01:04:14,226 --> 01:04:16,603
There's a alien battle cruiser
about to-

771
01:04:16,895 --> 01:04:19,731
There's always an alien battle
cruiser or a death ray...

772
01:04:20,023 --> 01:04:22,859
...or an intergalactic plague
about to wipe out life on Earth.

773
01:04:23,026 --> 01:04:25,987
The only way people get on
with their happy lives...

774
01:04:26,154 --> 01:04:28,865
...is they do not know about it!

775
01:04:33,662 --> 01:04:35,539
And don't worry about the bug.

776
01:04:35,914 --> 01:04:38,250
He's not leaving town.
We got his ship.

777
01:04:46,091 --> 01:04:48,051
We need a containment crew...

778
01:04:48,260 --> 01:04:49,970
...on MacDougal Street.

779
01:04:50,762 --> 01:04:54,433
Containment may be a moot point.
The exodus continues.

780
01:04:54,683 --> 01:04:58,478
The party's over, and the last one
to leave gets stuck with the check.

781
01:04:58,854 --> 01:05:01,189
You sorry little ingrates!

782
01:05:09,364 --> 01:05:10,991
What about the Arquillians?

783
01:05:11,199 --> 01:05:14,703
We've translated part of the message:
" Deliver the Galaxy. "

784
01:05:14,870 --> 01:05:18,123
- They don't want much, do they?
- Oh, it gets better.

785
01:05:18,415 --> 01:05:19,916
They hold us responsible.

786
01:05:28,842 --> 01:05:30,802
Where do you keep your dead?

787
01:05:31,011 --> 01:05:32,846
I don't have any dead.

788
01:05:33,346 --> 01:05:34,514
Where?

789
01:05:34,681 --> 01:05:36,016
I don't know.

790
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:38,560
The city morgue?

791
01:05:48,528 --> 01:05:50,989
That's three for a dollar, sir!

792
01:05:51,615 --> 01:05:54,492
It was some light
that refracted off of Venus...

793
01:05:54,743 --> 01:05:56,202
...into some swamp gas...

794
01:05:56,453 --> 01:05:57,913
...and that's what made the...

795
01:05:58,288 --> 01:05:59,581
All right, kid!

796
01:06:00,457 --> 01:06:01,791
Excuse me.
What's up?

797
01:06:02,083 --> 01:06:04,753
The Arquillians want the Galaxy,
whatever that means.

798
01:06:04,920 --> 01:06:06,838
We need help, a professional...

799
01:06:07,005 --> 01:06:10,258
...with years of experience
in intergalactic politics.

800
01:06:10,425 --> 01:06:13,136
I hope the little twerp
hasn't skipped town.

801
01:06:15,597 --> 01:06:17,307
If you'll gather over here...

802
01:06:17,682 --> 01:06:20,977
That's right, move in closer.
That's good. Thanks.

803
01:06:21,227 --> 01:06:24,731
If you look right here,
I'd appreciate it. Thank you.

804
01:06:37,744 --> 01:06:40,497
The worst disguise ever.
He's definitely an alien.

805
01:06:40,789 --> 01:06:43,500
You don't like it,
you can kiss my furry butt.

806
01:06:44,250 --> 01:06:45,043
Busy, Frank?

807
01:06:45,418 --> 01:06:47,504
Can't talk now.
My flight's leaving in-

808
01:06:47,671 --> 01:06:48,713
Get your paws off!

809
01:06:48,963 --> 01:06:50,173
Call the pound!

810
01:06:50,423 --> 01:06:52,509
The dog owes my friend money.

811
01:06:52,759 --> 01:06:54,344
Arquillians and bugs,
what do you know?

812
01:06:54,594 --> 01:06:55,845
- Nothing.
- Not a thing?

813
01:06:58,765 --> 01:07:01,351
Stop, stop, stop it!
Okay, okay!

814
01:07:01,643 --> 01:07:03,812
Rosenberg wasn't a two-bit Arquillian.

815
01:07:04,062 --> 01:07:07,357
He was the guardian of the Galaxy.
He thought he'd be safe on Earth.

816
01:07:07,732 --> 01:07:08,650
The bug had other plans.

817
01:07:08,817 --> 01:07:12,696
The Galaxy is the best source
for subatomic energy in the universe.

818
01:07:12,946 --> 01:07:15,699
If the bugs get it,
kiss the Arquillians goodbye.

819
01:07:15,949 --> 01:07:16,991
Ask about the belt.

820
01:07:17,283 --> 01:07:19,869
Rosenberg mentioned Orion's belt.
What did he mean?

821
01:07:20,245 --> 01:07:21,955
- Beats me.
- Beats you?

822
01:07:22,747 --> 01:07:23,998
Not around.

823
01:07:26,918 --> 01:07:28,837
It's a ventriloquist act.

824
01:07:29,212 --> 01:07:31,089
The Galaxy is here!

825
01:07:31,881 --> 01:07:32,757
Here?

826
01:07:32,924 --> 01:07:35,468
A galaxy's millions of stars
and planets.

827
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:38,221
When will you learn
that size doesn't matter?

828
01:07:38,638 --> 01:07:41,724
If something's important,
it doesn't mean it's not small.

829
01:07:42,142 --> 01:07:43,059
How small?

830
01:07:43,226 --> 01:07:45,311
The size of a marble or a jewel.

831
01:07:45,895 --> 01:07:48,565
Excuse me. I gotta be walked
before my flight.

832
01:07:48,815 --> 01:07:49,607
Get out of here.

833
01:07:52,193 --> 01:07:55,572
If the Galaxy's here,
it's not on Orion's belt.

834
01:08:15,925 --> 01:08:17,844
When you want attention...

835
01:08:19,304 --> 01:08:20,180
Orion.

836
01:08:20,346 --> 01:08:22,182
That's a pretty name.

837
01:08:22,682 --> 01:08:24,267
What's this?

838
01:09:18,696 --> 01:09:20,823
Yes, good, thank you.

839
01:09:21,074 --> 01:09:24,202
Thank you for making sure
the bell works.

840
01:09:26,913 --> 01:09:28,539
What's up, Farmer John?

841
01:09:30,166 --> 01:09:32,710
A man came in here earlier.

842
01:09:33,294 --> 01:09:34,128
A dead man.

843
01:09:34,379 --> 01:09:36,422
And that means what to me?

844
01:09:38,383 --> 01:09:41,260
It was a very dear friend of mine.

845
01:09:42,053 --> 01:09:44,138
I believe he had an animal with him.

846
01:09:44,305 --> 01:09:46,849
It was a gift I gave him. A pet cat.

847
01:09:47,141 --> 01:09:48,726
It means worlds to me.

848
01:09:48,977 --> 01:09:50,812
I'd like to have it back.

849
01:09:51,020 --> 01:09:54,440
I'll need picture I.D.,
proof of ownership of the cat...

850
01:09:54,732 --> 01:09:58,194
...notarized proof of kinship
with the deceased.

851
01:09:59,153 --> 01:10:00,571
Don't do that.

852
01:10:02,365 --> 01:10:03,408
Do what?

853
01:10:04,575 --> 01:10:06,077
Don't do it.

854
01:10:08,746 --> 01:10:10,081
Oh, man.

855
01:10:25,722 --> 01:10:27,974
Look, Kay, let me handle this one.

856
01:10:28,182 --> 01:10:30,935
All we gotta do is get a cat.
It's not that hard.

857
01:10:31,227 --> 01:10:35,523
But if you go in there, you'll start
flashing your brain ray in her face.

858
01:10:35,690 --> 01:10:37,400
She'll wind up with leukemia.

859
01:10:37,608 --> 01:10:41,446
The doctor don't need you flashing away
her med-school classes. Five minutes.

860
01:10:41,654 --> 01:10:42,989
Two minutes.

861
01:10:45,533 --> 01:10:46,576
Where's the animal?

862
01:10:46,868 --> 01:10:48,369
I said I don't know.

863
01:10:48,578 --> 01:10:50,830
Well, let's see if we can find it.

864
01:10:56,252 --> 01:10:57,295
Hello!

865
01:11:06,596 --> 01:11:07,722
Hello!

866
01:11:12,143 --> 01:11:13,686
- How you doing?
- Hello.

867
01:11:13,978 --> 01:11:16,898
I'm Sergeant Friday
from the 26th Precinct.

868
01:11:17,106 --> 01:11:19,692
A cat came in with a corpse
the other day.

869
01:11:19,942 --> 01:11:22,028
- "Orion" on the nametag?
- Right.

870
01:11:22,820 --> 01:11:25,907
Well, this cat is a witness...

871
01:11:26,115 --> 01:11:28,576
...in a murder case.
I'll need to take him.

872
01:11:28,826 --> 01:11:30,369
I don't know where the cat is.

873
01:11:30,661 --> 01:11:31,954
You don't?

874
01:11:32,455 --> 01:11:35,124
No, but maybe you could take me
with you instead.

875
01:11:37,168 --> 01:11:40,171
Damn, you do start fast,
don't you?

876
01:11:40,338 --> 01:11:42,131
I'd really like to go with you...

877
01:11:42,590 --> 01:11:43,466
...now.

878
01:11:44,467 --> 01:11:46,802
And exactly why is that?

879
01:11:54,101 --> 01:11:56,145
I need to show you something.

880
01:11:56,729 --> 01:11:57,688
Slow down.

881
01:11:58,022 --> 01:12:01,192
- Girl, don't hit the gas like that!
- You don't understand.

882
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:03,736
You really need to see this.

883
01:12:03,945 --> 01:12:08,491
I will. One thing. I gotta drive.
It's not some macho trip.

884
01:12:08,699 --> 01:12:11,118
That's just the way I get down.

885
01:12:22,255 --> 01:12:24,882
Look, stud, you're
really not getting this.

886
01:12:25,132 --> 01:12:28,261
There's something I need you
to help me with.

887
01:12:39,188 --> 01:12:40,314
Freeze it!

888
01:12:40,523 --> 01:12:41,565
You are thick!

889
01:12:41,816 --> 01:12:42,900
How could I know?

890
01:12:43,109 --> 01:12:44,402
Did I have to sing it?

891
01:12:44,694 --> 01:12:46,195
You were like a drunk prom date.

892
01:12:46,487 --> 01:12:50,366
Typical. Anytime a woman shows
even a hint of sexual independence-

893
01:12:50,574 --> 01:12:51,409
Shut up!

894
01:12:51,617 --> 01:12:52,451
Let her go!

895
01:12:52,660 --> 01:12:54,370
Listen, monkey-boy...

896
01:12:54,745 --> 01:12:57,873
...I'm on the top rung
of the evolutionary ladder.

897
01:12:58,165 --> 01:12:59,208
So can it.

898
01:12:59,542 --> 01:13:02,044
Show me your face,
and I'll cure your ills.

899
01:13:02,211 --> 01:13:05,673
Ever pull wings off a fly?
Care to see the fly get even?

900
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:07,258
What about your ship?

901
01:13:07,550 --> 01:13:10,469
If that's what you call
that trash we got locked up.

902
01:13:10,678 --> 01:13:13,097
- Put your weapons down!
- Won't happen.

903
01:13:13,305 --> 01:13:14,140
It's okay.

904
01:13:14,390 --> 01:13:15,975
How is it okay?

905
01:13:16,225 --> 01:13:18,310
I'm saying it's gonna be okay.

906
01:13:18,561 --> 01:13:20,438
Don't bet on it, meat sack.

907
01:13:30,281 --> 01:13:31,866
Let me go!

908
01:13:42,793 --> 01:13:44,044
Go on!

909
01:13:48,007 --> 01:13:49,341
Take me here.

910
01:13:49,592 --> 01:13:50,384
No way.

911
01:13:51,886 --> 01:13:52,720
Take me!

912
01:14:10,696 --> 01:14:11,530
He's in a cab!

913
01:14:34,094 --> 01:14:36,514
Don't move! Don't move!
Don't move!

914
01:14:37,014 --> 01:14:38,474
Hey, man, what?

915
01:14:49,735 --> 01:14:52,571
He's not leaving the planet in a cab.
Let's go.

916
01:14:57,576 --> 01:15:00,162
Put up a bionet
all the way around Manhattan.

917
01:15:00,496 --> 01:15:02,790
If it's not human, it doesn't leave.

918
01:15:04,124 --> 01:15:05,709
What do we hear from upstairs?

919
01:15:05,918 --> 01:15:07,169
" Deliver the Galaxy. "

920
01:15:07,336 --> 01:15:10,381
The bug's got the Galaxy,
but we got his ship.

921
01:15:13,592 --> 01:15:15,886
Warning.
Plutonic fusion detection.

922
01:15:16,929 --> 01:15:19,306
Warning.
Plutonic fusion detection.

923
01:15:24,019 --> 01:15:26,563
- Why are they shooting at us?
- Battle rules.

924
01:15:26,814 --> 01:15:31,151
We get an ultimatum, a warning shot,
then a galactic week to respond.

925
01:15:31,652 --> 01:15:34,280
A galactic week?
How the hell long is that?

926
01:15:34,446 --> 01:15:35,489
One hour.

927
01:15:35,948 --> 01:15:37,032
One hour?

928
01:15:37,574 --> 01:15:38,742
Then what?

929
01:15:44,039 --> 01:15:45,332
That's bullshit!

930
01:15:45,541 --> 01:15:49,503
To keep the bugs from getting it,
Arquillians will destroy that galaxy.

931
01:15:49,712 --> 01:15:52,172
And whatever planet it's on.

932
01:15:53,340 --> 01:15:54,758
You're talking about us.

933
01:15:54,967 --> 01:15:56,468
Sucks, huh?

934
01:15:59,096 --> 01:16:01,765
I'll get the location
of every interstellar vehicle.

935
01:16:02,016 --> 01:16:04,143
I already did.
Frank took the last ship.

936
01:16:04,518 --> 01:16:06,603
- Sneden's Landing and Throg's Neck.
- Gone.

937
01:16:06,895 --> 01:16:08,689
- What about Atlantic City?
- Gone.

938
01:16:08,856 --> 01:16:10,357
- Bayonne?
- Gone.

939
01:16:10,566 --> 01:16:13,152
- There's Three Mile Island.
- Gone.

940
01:16:13,360 --> 01:16:15,446
- Staten Island?
- Gone, thank God.

941
01:16:15,821 --> 01:16:19,742
We're running out of time. If that
bug gets off Earth, we're bug food.

942
01:16:19,992 --> 01:16:21,035
Hey, old guys!

943
01:16:26,206 --> 01:16:28,083
Do those still work?

944
01:16:43,265 --> 01:16:45,350
- You're coming with me.
- What?

945
01:16:45,851 --> 01:16:48,687
It's a long trip.
I'll need a snack.

946
01:16:54,735 --> 01:16:55,694
The tunnel?

947
01:16:55,986 --> 01:16:58,822
- You know a better way to Queens?
- It'll be packed!

948
01:17:12,294 --> 01:17:13,504
Remember the red button?

949
01:17:14,171 --> 01:17:15,798
Push the red button.

950
01:17:16,632 --> 01:17:18,008
Put on a seat belt.

951
01:17:30,521 --> 01:17:33,148
You're much too tense.
You're young. Relax.

952
01:17:33,440 --> 01:17:35,234
Take some joy in your work.

953
01:17:35,400 --> 01:17:36,568
Do you like music?

954
01:17:40,739 --> 01:17:41,782
That's better.

955
01:17:41,990 --> 01:17:45,452
- in Norfolk, Virginia
California on my mind

956
01:17:45,953 --> 01:17:48,580
I straddled that Greyhound
And rode him into Raleigh

957
01:17:48,789 --> 01:17:50,666
And on across Caroline

958
01:17:51,041 --> 01:17:54,002
Somebody help me
Get out of Louisiana

959
01:17:55,921 --> 01:17:58,340
There are people there
Who care a little 'bout me

960
01:17:58,549 --> 01:18:01,927
- And won't let the poor boy down
- All right, now!

961
01:18:13,438 --> 01:18:15,023
You do know Elvis is dead?

962
01:18:15,232 --> 01:18:17,818
No, Elvis is not dead.
He just went home.

963
01:18:33,208 --> 01:18:34,751
You don't wanna eat me.

964
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:37,796
I'm an important person on my planet.
Like a queen!

965
01:18:37,963 --> 01:18:40,757
A goddess, even.
There are those who worship me.

966
01:18:41,091 --> 01:18:42,801
I'm not trying to impress you.

967
01:18:43,093 --> 01:18:45,095
I'm just saying it could start a war!

968
01:18:45,387 --> 01:18:47,848
Good, war. That means
more food for my family.

969
01:18:48,223 --> 01:18:51,518
All 78 million of them.
That's a lot of mouths to feed.

970
01:18:51,727 --> 01:18:54,313
You're a wonderful dad,
but I'm staying here!

971
01:19:16,001 --> 01:19:18,086
Now, that's what I'm talking about.

972
01:19:19,504 --> 01:19:21,214
Roaches check in.

973
01:19:23,300 --> 01:19:24,551
They don't check out.

974
01:19:29,389 --> 01:19:33,435
Warning. Eight minutes
to the destruction of Earth.

975
01:19:35,228 --> 01:19:36,480
Eight minutes...

976
01:19:36,813 --> 01:19:38,065
...to destruction.

977
01:20:23,193 --> 01:20:26,029
We'll use pulsar level five
with an implosion factor.

978
01:20:26,321 --> 01:20:27,113
What?!

979
01:20:27,364 --> 01:20:30,575
Just shoot the damn thing
on the count of three. One...

980
01:20:30,784 --> 01:20:32,077
...two, three!

981
01:21:32,762 --> 01:21:34,306
You idiots!

982
01:21:35,557 --> 01:21:37,309
You don't get it!

983
01:21:37,642 --> 01:21:38,476
I've won.

984
01:21:39,311 --> 01:21:41,104
It's over.

985
01:21:41,605 --> 01:21:43,481
You're milk-suckers!

986
01:21:44,065 --> 01:21:45,775
You don't matter.

987
01:21:46,109 --> 01:21:48,612
In a few seconds,
you won't even be matter.

988
01:21:48,778 --> 01:21:51,531
You're under arrest
for violating the Tycho Treaty.

989
01:21:51,740 --> 01:21:54,492
So hand over whatever galaxy
you might be carrying...

990
01:21:54,701 --> 01:21:57,454
...and put your hands on your head.

991
01:22:02,459 --> 01:22:04,336
I'll put my hands...

992
01:22:06,838 --> 01:22:08,048
...on my head.

993
01:22:12,427 --> 01:22:13,470
Like this?

994
01:22:42,832 --> 01:22:44,918
That did not go the way I planned.

995
01:22:45,085 --> 01:22:46,795
Don't let him on the second ship.

996
01:22:47,087 --> 01:22:49,964
- What are you talking about?
- Keep him on this planet.

997
01:22:50,215 --> 01:22:52,217
Where are you going?

998
01:22:52,842 --> 01:22:54,677
I'm gonna get my gun back.

999
01:22:57,514 --> 01:22:58,306
Hey, bug!

1000
01:22:58,556 --> 01:23:01,434
You know how many of your kind
I've swatted with a paper?

1001
01:23:01,768 --> 01:23:04,312
You're just a smear
on the sports page...

1002
01:23:04,521 --> 01:23:07,440
...you slimy, gut-sucking,
intestinal parasite!

1003
01:23:07,941 --> 01:23:09,275
Eat me!

1004
01:23:09,526 --> 01:23:10,819
Eat me!

1005
01:23:29,212 --> 01:23:30,130
What's up?

1006
01:23:30,630 --> 01:23:33,925
You just gonna eat and run?
What about dessert?

1007
01:23:39,806 --> 01:23:41,307
That's it?

1008
01:23:41,724 --> 01:23:45,186
Where you going?
This party's just getting started.

1009
01:23:45,895 --> 01:23:47,272
Where you going?

1010
01:23:48,314 --> 01:23:49,941
Where you going?

1011
01:23:51,109 --> 01:23:52,277
Let me tell you.

1012
01:23:52,485 --> 01:23:55,905
There's only one way off this planet,
and that's through me.

1013
01:24:39,449 --> 01:24:40,950
Where you going?

1014
01:24:41,784 --> 01:24:43,369
Why you running, huh?

1015
01:24:43,786 --> 01:24:45,455
I'm still standing.

1016
01:24:46,164 --> 01:24:48,124
Come on, bring it. Bring it!

1017
01:25:07,935 --> 01:25:10,480
I'm sorry.
Was that your auntie?

1018
01:25:12,607 --> 01:25:14,525
That means that's your uncle.

1019
01:25:17,528 --> 01:25:18,821
You all look alike.

1020
01:25:27,163 --> 01:25:28,915
Well, well.

1021
01:25:29,248 --> 01:25:32,627
Big, bad bug got
a bit of a soft spot, huh?

1022
01:25:36,297 --> 01:25:38,383
I can't understand why you gotta...

1023
01:25:38,674 --> 01:25:41,135
...come down here
bringing all this ruckus...

1024
01:25:41,427 --> 01:25:44,097
...snatching up galaxies
and everything.

1025
01:25:44,347 --> 01:25:48,518
My attitude is, don't start nothing,
won't be nothing.

1026
01:25:54,774 --> 01:25:58,444
Ease up out of my face before
something bad happens to you.

1027
01:26:00,530 --> 01:26:01,572
Too late.

1028
01:26:31,269 --> 01:26:33,646
Tell the Arquillians
we have the Galaxy.

1029
01:26:33,938 --> 01:26:35,731
You got it, friend.

1030
01:26:37,441 --> 01:26:39,527
Going to get your gun back, huh?

1031
01:26:39,819 --> 01:26:41,237
I like this gun.

1032
01:26:41,988 --> 01:26:46,159
While you was in there playing around,
I was doing all the work.

1033
01:26:46,450 --> 01:26:49,412
I had to bean him in the head
with this big rock.

1034
01:26:49,745 --> 01:26:51,622
I was gonna hit him with a 2-by-4.

1035
01:26:51,831 --> 01:26:53,457
He kicked me. It hurt.

1036
01:26:53,708 --> 01:26:56,377
But then I got to the fire.
I was like that with it.

1037
01:26:56,711 --> 01:26:59,130
Not bad for your second
day of work, is it?

1038
01:26:59,964 --> 01:27:03,301
This definitely rates a 9.0
on my weird-shit-o-metre.

1039
01:27:03,676 --> 01:27:07,471
Should've been here for
the Zeronion migration in 1968.

1040
01:27:10,057 --> 01:27:12,685
I guess you weren't even alive in '68.

1041
01:27:18,399 --> 01:27:21,027
Interesting job you guys have.

1042
01:27:37,168 --> 01:27:38,961
I know we got these rules...

1043
01:27:39,253 --> 01:27:41,422
...but she did help us bust that bug.

1044
01:27:41,714 --> 01:27:44,342
Maybe we didn't have to
flashy-thing her.

1045
01:27:46,052 --> 01:27:49,221
Come on. Who will she tell?
She hang out with dead people.

1046
01:27:49,555 --> 01:27:51,098
It's not for her.

1047
01:27:51,474 --> 01:27:52,683
It's for me.

1048
01:27:54,393 --> 01:27:55,728
What?

1049
01:27:57,897 --> 01:27:59,148
Aren't they beautiful?

1050
01:28:00,941 --> 01:28:01,734
Stars.

1051
01:28:02,401 --> 01:28:05,404
I never look at them anymore,
but they actually are...

1052
01:28:08,240 --> 01:28:09,575
...beautiful.

1053
01:28:14,246 --> 01:28:16,666
Kay, you're frightening your partner.

1054
01:28:16,874 --> 01:28:20,044
I've been training a replacement,
not a partner.

1055
01:28:21,087 --> 01:28:22,755
Wait a minute, Kay.

1056
01:28:23,172 --> 01:28:25,466
I cannot do this job by myself.

1057
01:28:25,633 --> 01:28:28,386
Guys, my apartment isn't
anywhere near here.

1058
01:28:28,594 --> 01:28:30,554
It's not even on the same island.

1059
01:28:32,139 --> 01:28:33,182
Days...

1060
01:28:33,349 --> 01:28:34,475
...months...

1061
01:28:34,850 --> 01:28:35,935
...years.

1062
01:28:36,310 --> 01:28:37,978
Always face it forward.

1063
01:28:47,655 --> 01:28:50,282
I was in an interstellar
cockroach's gullet.

1064
01:28:50,533 --> 01:28:52,993
That's one of 100 memories
I don't want.

1065
01:29:10,094 --> 01:29:11,387
See you around.

1066
01:29:17,643 --> 01:29:18,811
No...

1067
01:29:19,687 --> 01:29:20,896
...you won't.

1068
01:29:56,765 --> 01:29:59,101
The high consulate
from Solaxium 9...

1069
01:29:59,310 --> 01:30:01,187
...wants seats for the Bulls game.

1070
01:30:01,395 --> 01:30:03,981
Call Dennis Rodman.
He's from that planet.

1071
01:30:06,233 --> 01:30:07,818
Rodman? You're kidding.

1072
01:30:08,152 --> 01:30:09,195
Nope.

1073
01:30:09,778 --> 01:30:11,822
Not much of a disguise.
