00:00:46,475 --> 00:00:48,136
You made me jump.

00:00:48,226 --> 00:00:51,218
Daisy, what is the matter with you?
You're all thumbs.

4
00:00:51,313 --> 00:00:53,851
Sorry. I hate this room.

5
00:00:54,066 --> 00:00:56,398
Why? What's the matter with it?

6
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:05,200
ANNA: Daisy?

7
00:01:29,857 --> 00:01:31,598
Who's that from, Papa?

8
00:01:31,692 --> 00:01:34,526
-You seem very absorbed.
-Your aunt Rosamond.

9
00:01:34,696 --> 00:01:37,859
-Anything interesting?
-Nothing to trouble you with.

10
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:40,989
Poor Aunt Rosamond.
All alone in that big house.

11
00:01:41,371 --> 00:01:43,908
-I feel so sorry for her.
-I don't.

12
00:01:44,207 --> 00:01:47,199
All alone with plenty of money
in a house in Eaton Square?

13
00:01:47,293 --> 00:01:49,410
I can't imagine anything better.

14
00:01:49,505 --> 00:01:52,042
Really, Mary,
I wish you wouldn't talk like that.

15
00:01:52,132 --> 00:01:56,252
There will come a day when
someone thinks you mean what you say.

16
00:01:56,388 --> 00:01:58,880
It can't come soon enough for me.

17
00:01:59,516 --> 00:02:01,508
Carson, I'll be in the library.

18
00:02:01,602 --> 00:02:03,395
Will you let me know
when her ladyship is down?

19
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:06,471
-Certainly, my lord.
-Sybil, darling. This one's for you.

20
00:02:12,823 --> 00:02:15,534
SYBIL: <i>I saw another opening
for a secretary and I applied.</i>

21
00:02:15,618 --> 00:02:19,452
-But you never said.
-I didn't want you to be disappointed.

22
00:02:19,581 --> 00:02:21,663
I thought you'd given up.

23
00:02:21,833 --> 00:02:24,121
I'll never give up and nor will you.

24
00:02:24,211 --> 00:02:26,327
Things are changing for women, Gwen.

25
00:02:26,422 --> 00:02:30,792
-Not just the vote but our lives.
-But it's tomorrow! At 10:00.

26
00:02:31,177 --> 00:02:35,011
Last time we waited for weeks
and weeks, and this one's tomorrow!

27
00:02:35,181 --> 00:02:38,300
Then we must be ready
by tomorrow, mustn't we?

28
00:02:39,687 --> 00:02:41,303
I thought I'd write to Edith

29
00:02:41,397 --> 00:02:43,733
-to settle our promised church visit.
-If you want.

30
00:02:43,817 --> 00:02:45,151
We can't just throw her over

31
00:02:45,235 --> 00:02:47,237
when she made such an effort
to arrange the last one.

32
00:02:47,321 --> 00:02:49,562
-It's all in your head.
-I don't think so.

33
00:02:49,656 --> 00:02:52,115
Then she's barking up the wrong tree.

34
00:02:52,201 --> 00:02:55,444
Poor Edith. I hope there's a right tree
for her somewhere.

35
00:02:55,538 --> 00:02:58,583
Ma'am, I was wondering if
I might take some time this afternoon

36
00:02:58,667 --> 00:03:01,127
-to help in the village hall.
-Why? What's happening?

37
00:03:01,211 --> 00:03:03,261
It's the flower show, sir, next Saturday.

38
00:03:03,589 --> 00:03:05,716
I'll give my father a hand with his stall,
if I may.

39
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:09,259
-Of course you must go.
-And so, I'm afraid, must I.

40
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:23,521
Is Mr. Carson about?

41
00:03:23,612 --> 00:03:26,212
I don't think so.
I was just looking for him, myself.

44
00:03:37,795 --> 00:03:41,289
I'm just trying to sort out
the wretched flower show.

45
00:03:42,592 --> 00:03:45,881
-I've had a letter from Rosamond.
-Don't tell me.

46
00:03:46,097 --> 00:03:50,182
She wants a saddle of lamb and all
the fruit and vegetables we can muster.

47
00:03:50,434 --> 00:03:52,722
She enjoys a taste of her old home.

48
00:03:52,854 --> 00:03:55,221
She enjoys not paying for food.

49
00:03:55,732 --> 00:03:57,222
There's something else...

50
00:03:57,317 --> 00:04:00,317
Apparently, the word is going round London
that Evelyn Napier

51
00:04:00,405 --> 00:04:02,362
has given up any thought of Mary.

52
00:04:02,448 --> 00:04:05,236
That he's going to marry
one of the Semphill girls.

53
00:04:05,326 --> 00:04:08,820
She writes as if, somehow,
it reflects badly on Mary.

54
00:04:09,206 --> 00:04:12,415
Your dear sister is always
such a harbinger of joy.

55
00:04:12,626 --> 00:04:14,083
No, as if...

56
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:19,456
As if Mary had somehow been
found wanting. In her character.

57
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:22,961
I don't believe Mr. Napier
would have said that.

58
00:04:23,055 --> 00:04:26,298
-Neither do I, really, but...
-She ought to be married.

59
00:04:26,392 --> 00:04:29,385
-Talk to her.
-She never listens to me.

60
00:04:29,771 --> 00:04:31,978
If she did, she'd marry Matthew.

61
00:04:32,107 --> 00:04:34,315
What about Anthony Strallan?

62
00:04:34,444 --> 00:04:38,233
Anthony Strallan is at least my age
and as dull as paint.

63
00:04:38,656 --> 00:04:41,576
I doubt she'd want to sit next to him
at dinner, let alone marry him.

64
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:44,152
She has to marry someone, Robert.

65
00:04:44,246 --> 00:04:47,739
And if this is what's being said
in London, she has to marry soon.

66
00:04:54,466 --> 00:04:56,333
You shouldn't do that in here.

67
00:04:56,594 --> 00:04:59,427
I don't like being in
the pantry all alone.

68
00:04:59,513 --> 00:05:01,556
And Mr. Carson won't mind.
He's gone into the village.

69
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,632
He'll mind if I tell him.

70
00:05:03,935 --> 00:05:06,347
-That's pretty.
-Do you think so?

71
00:05:06,646 --> 00:05:10,359
She wants it put onto a new shirt,
but it's a bit old-fashioned to my taste.

72
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:12,150
Oh, no, it's lovely.

73
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:15,612

74
00:05:17,034 --> 00:05:19,526
-What from?
-She had a bit of a turn.

75
00:05:19,828 --> 00:05:21,478
When we were in Lady Mary's room.

76
00:05:21,705 --> 00:05:23,290
-Didn't you?
-I'm fine, thank you.

77
00:05:23,374 --> 00:05:26,036
What sort of a turn? Did you see a ghost?

78
00:05:26,169 --> 00:05:28,462
Will you leave her alone,
if she doesn't want to talk about it?

79
00:05:28,546 --> 00:05:32,211
I've often wondered if this place
is haunted. It ought to be.

80
00:05:32,343 --> 00:05:35,131
By the spirits of maids and
footmen who died in slavery.

81
00:05:35,221 --> 00:05:37,098

Come on, Daisy. What was it?

84
00:05:51,323 --> 00:05:54,236
I don't know. I was thinking...
First we had the <i>Titanic.</i>

85

-Don't keep harping back to that.
-I know it was a while ago, but we knew 'em.

86
00:05:58,414 --> 00:06:03,909
I think of how I laid the fires for Mr.
Patrick, but he drowned in them icy waters.

87
00:06:04,003 --> 00:06:05,335
For God's sake.

88
00:06:05,422 --> 00:06:07,834
And then there was the Turkish gentleman.

89
00:06:07,925 --> 00:06:10,469
It just seems there's been
too much death in the house.

90
00:06:10,553 --> 00:06:13,546
But what's that got to do
with Lady Mary's bedroom?

91
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:16,761
Nothing. Nothing at all.

92
00:06:29,449 --> 00:06:30,939
Afternoon, ma'am.

93
00:06:31,076 --> 00:06:34,786
When do you put that magnificent display
of prizes on show?

94
00:06:34,914 --> 00:06:36,370
Not till the day itself.

95
00:06:36,457 --> 00:06:38,869
I remember a superb cup from last year.

96
00:06:38,961 --> 00:06:40,372
The Grantham Cup.

97
00:06:40,462 --> 00:06:43,799
It was donated by the late Lord Grantham
for the best bloom in the village.

98
00:06:43,883 --> 00:06:46,216
-And who won it?
-I did.

99
00:06:48,638 --> 00:06:50,094
Well done.

100
00:06:51,474 --> 00:06:55,890
-And the year before?
-Her Ladyship won that one, too.

101
00:06:56,397 --> 00:07:00,642
Heavens, how thrilling. And before that?

102
00:07:02,195 --> 00:07:04,106
You've met my father.

Good afternoon, Mr. Molesley.

-What are you showing this year?
-Oh, this and that.

105

in the village.

00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:15,454
Really? What an achievement.

107
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:19,538
It's a wonderful area for roses.
We're very lucky.

108
00:07:20,382 --> 00:07:22,927
We'll see some beautiful
examples right across the show.

-Won't we, Mr. Molesley?
-If you say so, your ladyship.

-What's up with you?
-Nothing.

for spreading gossip about Lady Mary,

-but it was you, wasn't it?
-Why do you say that?

113
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,207
Because Napier wasn't in on it.

114
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:57,800
Only four people know
he was in her room that night.

115
00:07:57,884 --> 00:08:00,171
You, me, Lady Mary and possibly Daisy.

116
00:08:00,261 --> 00:08:01,971
And I haven't said nothing to nobody.

00:08:02,055 --> 00:08:03,432
Well, I didn't tell about Pamuk.

118

was no better than she ought to be.

-Only a friend of mine.

Oh, you know what they say
about old Savident.

00:08:11,566 --> 00:08:13,898
Not so much an open mind
as an open mouth.

-No wonder it's all round London.
-You won't tell, will you?

00:08:16,447 --> 00:08:19,656
-I'm in enough trouble as it is.
-Why? What's happened?

00:08:19,742 --> 00:08:21,660
I think Mr. Bates saw me nicking
a bottle of wine.

126
00:08:21,744 --> 00:08:23,577
-Has he told Mr. Carson?
-Not yet.

127
00:08:23,706 --> 00:08:27,244
But he will when he's feeling spiteful.
I wish we could be shot of him.

128
00:08:27,376 --> 00:08:28,543
Then think of something quick.

129
00:08:28,627 --> 00:08:32,587
Turn the tables on him,
before he has the chance to nail you.

130
00:08:36,136 --> 00:08:38,048
I thought you went to bed hours ago.

00:08:38,139 --> 00:08:41,391
I was writing a note for Lynch.

00:08:42,643 --> 00:08:45,887
-I'm going into Malton.
-Don't risk the traffic in Malton.

Not now every Tom, Dick and Harry
seems to have a motor.

00:08:48,442 --> 00:08:50,024
-Hardly.
-Last time I was there,

136
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:52,363
there were five cars
parked in the market place,

137
00:08:52,447 --> 00:08:54,573
and another three drove past
while I was waiting.

138
00:08:54,657 --> 00:08:57,069
Get Branson to take you in the car.

139
00:08:57,243 --> 00:09:00,828
-Neither of us is using it.
-I thought I'd pop in on old Mrs. Stuart.

00:09:00,956 --> 00:09:03,288
Will you tell Mama, if I forget?

141
00:09:13,012 --> 00:09:15,174
You're late this morning.

142
00:09:15,306 --> 00:09:17,673
The library grate
needed a real going-over.

143
00:09:17,808 --> 00:09:21,143
-Are any of them down yet?
-Lady Sybil's in the dining room.

144
00:09:21,271 --> 00:09:23,933
-I'll start with her room, then.
-Daisy?

145
00:09:24,983 --> 00:09:28,278
You know when you were talking
about the feeling of death in the house.

146
00:09:28,362 --> 00:09:29,602
I was just being silly.

147
00:09:29,697 --> 00:09:32,690
I found myself wondering
about the connection between

148
00:09:32,826 --> 00:09:36,660
the poor Turkish gentleman, Mr. Pamuk,
and Lady Mary's room.

149
00:09:37,706 --> 00:09:41,871
Only you were saying how
you felt so uncomfortable in there.

150
00:09:44,089 --> 00:09:47,674
Well, I've got to get on.
I'm late enough as it is.

151
00:09:56,019 --> 00:09:57,225
Hello.

152
00:10:01,943 --> 00:10:05,652
-Is everything all right?
-Oh, hello. I am about to send a telegram.

153
00:10:05,738 --> 00:10:06,853
Oh.

154
00:10:09,201 --> 00:10:12,739
Papa's sister is always nagging
him to send supplies to London,

155
00:10:12,871 --> 00:10:16,866
and then we cable her so her butler
can be at King's Cross to meet them.

156
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:20,294
-It's idiotic, really.
-Is this Lady Rosamond Painswick?

157
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:23,800
-You have done your homework.
-She wrote to welcome me into the family,

158
00:10:23,884 --> 00:10:27,252
which I thought pretty generous,
given the circumstances.

159
00:10:27,388 --> 00:10:31,053
It's easy to be generous
when you have nothing to lose.

160
00:10:32,561 --> 00:10:35,350
So are you doing any more
church visiting with Edith?

161
00:10:35,439 --> 00:10:37,316
My mother's trying to set something up.

162
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,892
Watch out. I think she
has big plans for you.

163
00:10:40,069 --> 00:10:42,437
Then she's in for
an equally big disappointment.

164
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:55,002
-Is it all right to do the fire?
-Why are you so late?

165
00:10:55,086 --> 00:10:58,170
I went back to my room
after I'd woken everyone,

166
00:10:58,299 --> 00:11:02,010
and I just shut my eyes for a moment.
I've been trying to catch up ever since.

167
00:11:02,094 --> 00:11:04,507
-ANNA: Have you had any breakfast?
-Not a crumb.

168
00:11:04,598 --> 00:11:05,759
Here.

169
00:11:06,933 --> 00:11:10,104
-Wait! You can't take her biscuits.
-She never eats them. None of them do.

170
00:11:10,188 --> 00:11:12,231
They're just thrown away
and changed every evening.

171
00:11:12,315 --> 00:11:16,104
Thanks. She wouldn't mind anyway.
She's nice, Lady Sybil.

[EXCLAIMS]

173
00:11:24,954 --> 00:11:26,490
-Gwen?
-[GASPS]

174
00:11:27,457 --> 00:11:30,792
May I ask why you are sitting
on Lady Sybil's bed?

175
00:11:31,295 --> 00:11:35,835
Well, you see, I had a turn, like a
burst of sickness, just sudden-like.

176
00:11:35,966 --> 00:11:37,503
I had to sit down.

177
00:11:38,303 --> 00:11:40,638
-It's true.
-Well, you'd better go and lie down.

178
00:11:40,722 --> 00:11:44,181
-I'll tell Mrs. Hughes.
-I don't need to interrupt her morning.

179
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:46,910
I'm sure I'll be fine
if I could just put my feet up.

180
00:11:47,146 --> 00:11:49,478
And how many bedrooms
have you still got to do?

181
00:11:49,565 --> 00:11:52,809
-Just one. Lady Edith's.
-And you can manage on your own?

182
00:11:52,986 --> 00:11:55,978
Well, she's no use
to man or beast in that state.

183
00:11:56,156 --> 00:11:57,317
Go on. Shoo.

184
00:12:01,829 --> 00:12:03,240
Daisy?

185
00:12:03,331 --> 00:12:06,996
May I ask why you are holding
Lady Sybil's biscuit jar?

186
00:12:10,005 --> 00:12:12,998
I was just polishing
it before I put it back.

187
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:15,671
See that you do.

188
00:12:23,521 --> 00:12:26,771
MRS PATMORE: I'm sorry, my lady,
but I can't do more than my best.

189
00:12:26,858 --> 00:12:29,725
Is there some difficulty, your ladyship?

190
00:12:30,237 --> 00:12:31,819
Dear Mrs. Hughes, as you know,

191
00:12:31,905 --> 00:12:34,533
we're giving a dinner on Friday
for Sir Anthony Strallan.

192
00:12:34,617 --> 00:12:35,732
Yes, my lady.

193
00:12:35,827 --> 00:12:38,829
Well, it seems he is particularly fond
of a certain new pudding.

194
00:12:38,913 --> 00:12:41,121
It's called apple
charlotte. Do you know it?

195
00:12:42,126 --> 00:12:43,662
I'm not sure.

196
00:12:44,003 --> 00:12:46,171
His sister, Mrs. Chetwood,
sent me the receipt,

197
00:12:46,255 --> 00:12:48,466
I'm trying to persuade Mrs. Patmore
to make it.

198
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:50,259
And I'm trying to persuade her ladyship

199
00:12:50,343 --> 00:12:54,212
that I have already planned the dinner
with her, and I can't change it now.

200
00:12:54,307 --> 00:12:55,388
Why not?

201
00:12:55,474 --> 00:12:57,841
Because everything's been
ordered and prepared.

202
00:12:57,935 --> 00:13:00,605
Well, there's nothing here
that looks very complicated.

203
00:13:00,689 --> 00:13:02,271
Apples, lemons, butter...

204
00:13:02,357 --> 00:13:05,475
I cannot work from a new receipt
at a moment's notice!

205
00:13:05,569 --> 00:13:07,919
But I can read it to you,
if that's the problem.

206
00:13:08,031 --> 00:13:09,317
Problem?

207
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:11,322
Who mentioned a problem?

208
00:13:11,409 --> 00:13:14,823
How dare you say such a thing
in front of her ladyship!

209
00:13:14,913 --> 00:13:18,458
Very well. We'll try it another time,
when you've had longer to prepare.

210
00:13:18,542 --> 00:13:20,783
We'll stay with the raspberry meringue.

211
00:13:20,878 --> 00:13:23,667
-And very nice it'll be, too.
-I'm sure.

212
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:29,304
MRS PATMORE:
Have you taken leave of your senses?

213
00:13:29,388 --> 00:13:32,426
I'm so sorry about that, my lady.

214
00:13:32,516 --> 00:13:34,883
Never mind. I was asking a lot.

215
00:13:35,019 --> 00:13:37,887
-Do look after that girl.
-Daisy?

216
00:13:38,106 --> 00:13:41,189
-She's used to it. She'll be all right.
-I wonder.

217
00:13:41,276 --> 00:13:43,769
Mrs. Patmore looks ready to eat her alive.

218
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:45,197
I was only trying to help.

219
00:13:45,281 --> 00:13:48,649
Oh, like Judas was only
"trying to help" I suppose,

220
00:13:48,743 --> 00:13:51,143
when he brought the Roman soldiers
to the garden!

221
00:14:07,598 --> 00:14:10,762
I had to let your skirt down a little,
but I can put it back.

222
00:14:10,852 --> 00:14:12,559
No, it's yours.

223
00:14:12,813 --> 00:14:15,189
What will happen if one of the
maids finds your room is empty?

224
00:14:15,273 --> 00:14:17,651
Oh, but it'd only be Anna,
and she wouldn't give me away.

225
00:14:17,735 --> 00:14:20,147
She's like a sister.
She'd never betray me.

226
00:14:20,238 --> 00:14:23,606
[CHUCKLES] Then she's not like my sisters.
Walk on.

227
00:14:31,626 --> 00:14:33,867
-Shall I give you a hand?
-Oh, would you?

228
00:14:33,962 --> 00:14:36,374
It takes half the time with two.

229
00:14:38,968 --> 00:14:42,381
-I always feel a bit sorry for Lady Edith.
-Me too.

230
00:14:42,513 --> 00:14:43,722
Although I don't know why,

231
00:14:43,806 --> 00:14:46,720
when you think what
she's got and we haven't.

232
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:49,854
Mrs. Hughes said she was after
the other heir, Mr Patrick Crawley.

233
00:14:49,938 --> 00:14:52,180
-The one who drowned.
-That was different.

234
00:14:52,275 --> 00:14:54,482
-She was in love with him.
-What happened?

235
00:14:54,569 --> 00:14:57,903
She never got a look in.
He was all set up to marry Lady Mary.

236
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:01,149
Then he was a braver man
than I am, Gunga Din.

237
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,867
Sad to think about.

238
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:10,246
It's always sad when you love someone
who doesn't love you back.

239
00:15:10,336 --> 00:15:12,247
No matter who you are.

240
00:15:13,507 --> 00:15:16,124
No, I mean it's sad that he died.

241
00:15:17,303 --> 00:15:19,340
Oh. Yes.

242
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:23,132
Very sad. He was nice.

243
00:15:24,936 --> 00:15:27,554
Well, thank you for that.

244
00:15:28,274 --> 00:15:30,686
-Much appreciated.
-My pleasure.

245
00:15:31,235 --> 00:15:35,025
Perhaps Mr. Patrick did love her back,
he just couldn't say it.

246
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,650
Why ever not?

247
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:42,947
Sometimes we're not at liberty to speak.

248
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:45,533
Sometimes it wouldn't be right.

249
00:16:03,231 --> 00:16:04,767
Take a seat.

00:16:33,807 --> 00:16:35,799
COUNTESS: The flower show?

252
00:16:35,935 --> 00:16:38,645
Oh, I thought I was in for another
telling off about the hospital.

253
00:16:38,729 --> 00:16:41,016
No. This time it's the flower show.

254
00:16:41,107 --> 00:16:43,896
I've been to see old Mr. Molesley's garden.

255
00:16:44,069 --> 00:16:47,858
And his roses are the most beautiful
I've ever laid eyes on.

256
00:16:48,407 --> 00:16:50,149
-Go on.
-You may not know it,

257
00:16:50,243 --> 00:16:53,281
but I believe the committee feel
obliged to give you the cup

258
00:16:53,371 --> 00:16:55,954
for the best bloom
as a kind of local tradition.

259
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:58,157
No. No, I do not know that.

260
00:16:58,669 --> 00:17:02,378
I thought I usually won the prize
for "best bloom in the village"

261
00:17:02,464 --> 00:17:06,459
because my gardener had
grown the best bloom in the village.

262
00:17:06,595 --> 00:17:09,929
Yes, but you don't "usually" win, do you?

263
00:17:10,516 --> 00:17:12,098
You always win.

264
00:17:13,436 --> 00:17:17,225
Yes. I have been very fortunate
in that regard.

265
00:17:17,399 --> 00:17:20,642
But, surely, when Mr. Molesley's garden
is so remarkable

266
00:17:20,736 --> 00:17:23,444
and he is so very proud of his roses...

267
00:17:23,572 --> 00:17:25,985
You talk of Mr. Molesley's pride?

268
00:17:26,826 --> 00:17:29,238
What about my gardener's pride?

269
00:17:29,746 --> 00:17:33,331
Is he to be sacrificed on the altar
of Molesley's ambition?

270
00:17:33,459 --> 00:17:37,953
All I'm asking is that you release them
from any obligation to let you win.

271
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:40,961
Why not just tell them to choose
whichever flower is best?

272
00:17:41,051 --> 00:17:44,169
But that is precisely
what they already know.

273
00:17:44,596 --> 00:17:45,837
And do.

274
00:18:01,532 --> 00:18:04,490
I'm sorry, my lord.
I didn't think you'd be in here.

275
00:18:04,577 --> 00:18:08,037
Are my eyes deceiving me
or is one of these missing?

276
00:18:08,582 --> 00:18:11,916
-I don't know them well enough.
-No. Why would you?

277
00:18:12,002 --> 00:18:16,213
But there's a very pretty little blue one,
with a miniature framed in French paste.

278
00:18:16,341 --> 00:18:18,924
It was made for a German prince.
I forget who.

279
00:18:19,052 --> 00:18:21,886
Unless it's been moved for some reason.

280
00:18:23,099 --> 00:18:24,931
But why would it be?

281
00:18:37,281 --> 00:18:39,943
Can you help? I should be so grateful.

282
00:18:40,284 --> 00:18:43,277
Our horse has cast a shoe.
Is there a smithy nearby?

283
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:45,672
Aye. You can try old Crump
in the next village.

284
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:46,906

See, help's at hand.

286
00:18:49,254 --> 00:18:51,370
And at least it happened on the way home.

287
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:55,629
Oh, they'll be worried about you.
And if they check on me, I'm finished.

288
00:18:58,639 --> 00:19:01,809
-Is her ladyship wearing that now?
-Oh, no. This is for Friday night.

289
00:19:01,893 --> 00:19:04,395
I just thought I'd give it a press
while I had the time.

290
00:19:04,479 --> 00:19:06,648
You don't know what's happened
to Lady Sybil, do you?

291
00:19:06,732 --> 00:19:09,193
I've got the changes ready for the
other two, but there's no sign of her.

292
00:19:09,277 --> 00:19:12,315
Don't you start. I've had Her Majesty
on at me all afternoon.

293
00:19:12,405 --> 00:19:15,569
Mr. Carson says he'll fetch the police
if she's not back soon.

294
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,079
Sorry, Miss. But Mr. Crump's staying
over at the Skelton estate tonight.

295
00:19:19,163 --> 00:19:20,574
He's working there all week.

296
00:19:20,664 --> 00:19:23,327
-Is there anyone else?
-Not that I know of.

00:19:34,513 --> 00:19:36,972
SYBIL: Come on, Dragon, come on!

298
00:19:41,813 --> 00:19:45,773
Dragon, if you don't move now,
I'll have you boiled for glue!

299
00:19:52,159 --> 00:19:55,777
But what if she's overturned?
What if she's lying in a ditch somewhere?

300
00:19:55,871 --> 00:19:58,785
I'm sure she'll be back
in the shake of a lamb's tail.

301
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:02,618
The truth is they're all getting
too old for a mother's control.

-They're growing up.
-They've grown up.

303
00:20:05,132 --> 00:20:07,123
They need their own establishments.

304
00:20:07,218 --> 00:20:10,006
I'm sure they'll all get plenty of offers.

305
00:20:11,389 --> 00:20:14,222
No one ever warns you
about bringing up daughters.

be like <i>Little Women,</i>

other's throats from dawn till dusk.

when we've finished dinner.

00:20:38,586 --> 00:20:41,295
-You came up, then?
-Of course I did.

00:20:41,423 --> 00:20:44,273
-I had to change for the afternoon.
-Did you cover for me?

What do you think?

314
00:20:48,431 --> 00:20:51,017
I don't suppose this had
anything to do with Lady Sybil?

00:20:51,101 --> 00:20:53,764
Oh, Anna, it was a nightmare.

316
00:20:54,605 --> 00:20:56,732
I don't know how I got in
without being seen.

317
00:20:56,816 --> 00:20:59,216
I'm sure I've left a trail
of mud up the stairs.

318
00:21:00,279 --> 00:21:02,316
So, did you get the job?

319
00:21:05,117 --> 00:21:07,109

but your mother wanted you
to know Lady Sybil's back.

so dinner won't be late, after all.

00:32:39,535 --> 00:32:41,527
They'll organize a search, won't they?

496
00:32:41,622 --> 00:32:44,455
I wouldn't be Mr. Bates.
Not for all the tea in China.

497
00:32:44,541 --> 00:32:47,791
Wouldn't you, Thomas? I dare
say he feels just the same about you.

498
00:32:51,174 --> 00:32:53,586
-What's the matter with you?
-Nothing.

499
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:03,436
Oh! Just a minute.
I don't like to put it on earlier.

500
00:33:03,855 --> 00:33:06,893
It sinks in and spoils the effect.

501
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:15,570
Mama has released me, thank God.

502
00:33:16,537 --> 00:33:18,619
Sir Anthony seems nice enough.

503
00:33:18,706 --> 00:33:21,995
If you want to talk farming
and foxes by the hour.

504
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:26,537
I'm rather looking forward
to the flower show tomorrow.

505
00:33:27,048 --> 00:33:30,587
Where Mr. Molesley's roses
will turn everybody's heads.

506
00:33:30,678 --> 00:33:33,597
But if you tell Granny I said so,
I'll denounce you as a liar.

507
00:33:33,681 --> 00:33:35,012
I wouldn't dare.

508
00:33:35,224 --> 00:33:36,934
I'll leave that to my fearless mother.

509
00:33:37,018 --> 00:33:38,224
[BOTH CHUCKLE]

510
00:33:39,479 --> 00:33:41,939
-How were the cottages?
-They're coming on wonderfully.

511
00:33:42,023 --> 00:33:43,685
I'd love to show you.

512
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:46,692
Obviously, it's an act
of faith at this stage.

513
00:33:48,114 --> 00:33:49,320
Good God!

514
00:33:49,407 --> 00:33:50,694
[CHOKING]

515
00:33:51,326 --> 00:33:52,862
What on earth?

516
00:33:52,953 --> 00:33:55,872
I do apologize, Lady Grantham.
But I had a mouthful of salt.

517
00:33:55,956 --> 00:33:57,118
What?

518
00:33:59,419 --> 00:34:01,706
Everyone, put down your forks.

519
00:34:01,796 --> 00:34:06,007
Carson, remove this.
Bring fruit, bring cheese,

520
00:34:06,302 --> 00:34:11,013
bring anything to take this taste away!
Sir Anthony, I am so sorry.

521
00:34:12,058 --> 00:34:15,801
Fains I be Mrs. Patmore's
kitchen maid when the news gets out.

522
00:34:15,896 --> 00:34:18,935
Poor girl.
We ought to send in a rescue party.

523
00:34:19,108 --> 00:34:22,601
-You must think us very disorganized.
-Not at all.

524
00:34:22,987 --> 00:34:24,854
These things happen.

525
00:34:24,948 --> 00:34:26,063
[LAUGHING]

526
00:34:26,241 --> 00:34:27,572
[CRYING]

527
00:34:29,036 --> 00:34:33,622
Hey! Come on. It's not that bad.
Nobody's died.

528
00:34:34,501 --> 00:34:38,587
I don't understand it!
It must have been that Daisy!

529
00:34:39,089 --> 00:34:41,508
-She's muddled everything up before now!
-But I never...

530
00:34:41,592 --> 00:34:44,136
Don't worry, Daisy.
You're not in the line of fire here.

531
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:47,964
I know that pudding!
I chose it 'cause I know it!

532
00:34:48,183 --> 00:34:51,185
Which is why you wouldn't let her ladyship
have the pudding she wanted.

533
00:34:51,269 --> 00:34:53,136
Because you didn't know it.

534
00:34:53,231 --> 00:34:54,517
Exactly!

535
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:03,068
I don't see how it happened.

536
00:35:03,158 --> 00:35:06,322
Come on, everyone. Let's give Mrs. Patmore
some room to breathe.

537
00:35:08,122 --> 00:35:09,915
-You, too.
-I don't think I should leave her.

538
00:35:09,999 --> 00:35:12,582
Yes, you should.
Mr. Carson knows what he's doing.

539
00:35:14,046 --> 00:35:16,253
Don't do that.

540
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:20,084
Get William or the hall boy to do it.
It's beneath your dignity.

541
00:35:20,178 --> 00:35:22,215
It won't kill me.

542
00:35:25,725 --> 00:35:26,887
Now.

543
00:35:28,563 --> 00:35:30,770
All in your own good time…

544
00:35:33,734 --> 00:35:37,399
I think you've got something to tell me,
haven't you?

545
00:35:39,825 --> 00:35:42,568
ANNA: <i>I think I know
where that snuffbox is.</i>

546
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:44,786
Where?

547
00:35:45,331 --> 00:35:48,199
-Hidden in your room.
-You don't think...

548
00:35:48,294 --> 00:35:50,911
'Course I don't, you silly beggar.

549
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:53,371
-Then?
-I bet Thomas'd like it

550
00:35:53,465 --> 00:35:55,878
if they took you for a thief.

551
00:35:57,846 --> 00:35:59,507
Yes, I expect he would.

552
00:35:59,598 --> 00:36:01,806
Go upstairs now and find it.

553
00:36:01,893 --> 00:36:04,853
And when you have, you can
choose whether to put it in Thomas's room

554
00:36:04,937 --> 00:36:08,020
or give it to me,
and I'll slip it into Miss O'Brien's.

555
00:36:08,107 --> 00:36:11,226
-You naughty girl.
-Fight fire with fire.

556
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:13,231
That's what my mum says.

557
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:21,119
Poor Mrs. Patmore. Do you think
you should go down and see her?

558
00:36:21,205 --> 00:36:25,120
Tomorrow. She needs time
to recover her nerves.

559
00:36:25,419 --> 00:36:27,751
I knew there was something going on.

560
00:36:27,838 --> 00:36:30,752
It seems hard that poor Sir Anthony
had to pay the price.

561
00:36:30,842 --> 00:36:32,674
Good God!

562
00:36:32,802 --> 00:36:34,338
[LAUGHS]

563
00:36:34,596 --> 00:36:38,465
As for your giggling like a ridiculous
schoolgirl with Cousin Matthew!

564
00:36:38,559 --> 00:36:40,846
-It was pathetic.
-Poor Edith.

565
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:44,184
I am sorry Cousin Matthew's
proved a disappointment to you.

566
00:36:44,274 --> 00:36:45,935
Who says he has?

567
00:36:46,276 --> 00:36:48,392
Matthew. He told me.

568
00:36:50,281 --> 00:36:52,818
Oh, sorry. Wasn't I supposed to know?

569
00:36:54,118 --> 00:36:57,487
You were very helpful, Edith,
looking after Sir Anthony.

570
00:36:57,665 --> 00:37:00,282
-You saved the day.
-I enjoyed it.

571
00:37:01,335 --> 00:37:03,702
We seemed to have a lot to talk about.

572
00:37:15,309 --> 00:37:19,019
-Spare me your boasting, please.
-Now who's jealous?

573
00:37:19,523 --> 00:37:23,482
Jealous? Do you think I couldn't
have that old booby if I wanted him?

574
00:37:23,652 --> 00:37:26,566
-Even you can't take every prize.
-Is that a challenge?

575
00:37:27,532 --> 00:37:28,988
If you like.

576
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:36,993
I could almost manage for a long time,

577
00:37:37,084 --> 00:37:40,168
knowing the kitchen
and where everything was kept.

578
00:37:40,255 --> 00:37:44,920
-Even with that fool girl.
-I think you might owe Daisy an apology.

579
00:37:45,928 --> 00:37:47,089
Maybe.

580
00:37:47,763 --> 00:37:50,881
I've had a lot to put
up with, I can tell you.

581
00:37:51,267 --> 00:37:53,760
And you've not been to a doctor?

582
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:58,098
I don't need a doctor to tell me
I'm going blind.

583
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:04,445
A blind cook, Mr. Carson.

584
00:38:04,574 --> 00:38:06,612
[EXCLAIMS] What a joke.

585
00:38:07,244 --> 00:38:09,576
Whoever heard of such a thing?

586
00:38:10,789 --> 00:38:12,279
A blind cook.

587
00:38:18,631 --> 00:38:21,966
I hope our salty pudding
didn't spoil the evening for you.

588
00:38:22,053 --> 00:38:25,796
-On the contrary.
-I'm glad you and Mary are getting along.

589
00:38:25,890 --> 00:38:28,977
-There's no reason you can't be friends.
-No. No reason at all.

590
00:38:29,061 --> 00:38:33,055
I don't suppose there's any chance
that you could sort of start again?

591
00:38:33,231 --> 00:38:35,064
Life is full of surprises.

592
00:38:38,237 --> 00:38:41,150
Ah! I've been waiting for you.

593
00:38:41,241 --> 00:38:43,243
I've found a book over here
and I think it's just the thing

594
00:38:43,327 --> 00:38:44,567
to catch your interest.

595
00:38:44,661 --> 00:38:47,574
Oh, really? I'm intrigued.
What could it be?

596
00:38:47,664 --> 00:38:49,709
Well, I was looking
in the library and I...

597
00:38:49,793 --> 00:38:53,002
I was very taken by
what you were saying over dinner

598
00:38:53,129 --> 00:38:54,714
-about the way we...
-You're so right, Lady Mary.

599
00:38:54,798 --> 00:38:58,337
How clever you are. This is exactly
what we have to be aware of.

600
00:39:00,846 --> 00:39:04,260
There's a section just here
that I was rather unsure about.

601
00:39:08,438 --> 00:39:12,182
It seems we have both been
thrown over for a bigger prize.

602
00:39:14,195 --> 00:39:16,358
Heavens, is that the time?

603
00:39:16,949 --> 00:39:18,280
You're not going?

604
00:39:18,367 --> 00:39:20,199
The truth is my head's splitting.

605
00:39:20,327 --> 00:39:23,662
I don't want to spoil the party,
so I'll slip away.

606
00:39:24,624 --> 00:39:27,537
Would you make my excuses
to your parents?

607
00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:34,632
Excuse me, Sir Anthony.

608
00:39:41,184 --> 00:39:43,802
-Has Mr. Crawley left?
-Yes, my lady.

609
00:39:43,896 --> 00:39:45,227
But what about the car?

610
00:39:45,356 --> 00:39:47,316
Branson can't have brought it round
so quickly.

611
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,232
He said he'd rather walk, my lady.

612
00:39:49,318 --> 00:39:50,684
Thank you.

613
00:39:52,823 --> 00:39:56,066
-Mary can be such a child.
-What do you mean, darling?

614
00:39:58,705 --> 00:40:01,290
ROBERT: <i>She thinks if you put a toy down,
it'll still be sitting there</i>

615
00:40:01,374 --> 00:40:03,911
<i>when you want to play with it again.</i>

616
00:40:07,590 --> 00:40:10,878
-What are you talking about?
-Never mind.

617
00:40:22,773 --> 00:40:24,229
Mr. Carson?

618
00:40:25,109 --> 00:40:27,693
We were wondering about that snuff box.

619
00:40:28,113 --> 00:40:30,901
-Has it turned up yet?
-I'm afraid not.

620
00:40:31,283 --> 00:40:34,072
Well, I think we should have a search.

621
00:40:34,287 --> 00:40:35,448
What?

622
00:40:35,955 --> 00:40:38,040
It doesn't do to leave
these things too long.

623
00:40:38,124 --> 00:40:42,119
Mr Carson can search the men's rooms,
Mrs Hughes the women's.

624
00:40:42,296 --> 00:40:44,506
And it should be right away,
now we've talked of it.

625
00:40:44,590 --> 00:40:47,049
So no one has a chance to hide the box.

626
00:40:47,135 --> 00:40:48,796
Don't you agree, Mr. Carson?

627
00:40:48,887 --> 00:40:53,132
Well, perhaps it's for best.
Although I'm sure I won't find anything.

628
00:40:53,309 --> 00:40:55,300
I'll fetch Mrs. Hughes.

629
00:40:56,896 --> 00:41:00,561
-I think I'll just...
-I'd better check it's tidy.

630
00:41:03,070 --> 00:41:05,071
The bastard's hidden it
in my room or yours.

631
00:41:05,155 --> 00:41:07,648
Why did I ever listen to you
in the first place?

632
00:41:10,995 --> 00:41:12,611
Miss O'Brien?

633
00:41:16,835 --> 00:41:20,499
My, my. You have been busy.

634
00:41:27,347 --> 00:41:31,637
I was expecting you later than this.
I'll tell Molesley to lock up.

635
00:41:31,852 --> 00:41:33,843
Thanks. Good night, Mother.

636
00:41:35,524 --> 00:41:38,858
How was your evening?
Did you enjoy yourself?

637
00:41:40,362 --> 00:41:41,603
Quite.

638
00:41:42,365 --> 00:41:45,198
The thing is, just for
a moment I thought...

639
00:41:48,496 --> 00:41:51,831
Never mind what I thought.
I was wrong. Good night.

640
00:42:06,058 --> 00:42:09,050
My word, Molesley,
splendid roses as usual.

641
00:42:09,186 --> 00:42:10,939
-Well done.
-Thank you, your lordship.

642
00:42:11,023 --> 00:42:13,981
All the stalls are set
out very well this year.

643
00:42:14,067 --> 00:42:16,981
This is enchanting. Do we grow this?

644
00:42:17,071 --> 00:42:19,813
I doubt if you've got
that one, your ladyship.

645
00:42:20,033 --> 00:42:22,660
-I've only just found it, myself.
-CORA: is it a secret?

646
00:42:22,744 --> 00:42:26,704
-Or could you tell Mr. Brocket?
-I'd be glad to, my lady.

647
00:42:26,874 --> 00:42:30,334
He should come and see the rose garden.
He could give us some ideas.

648
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:34,334
Old Molesley's a champion.
Or he would be, in a fairer world.

649
00:42:34,424 --> 00:42:36,006
Don't you start.

650
00:42:36,092 --> 00:42:39,006
I'm afraid I've been annoying
Cousin Violet on that score.

651
00:42:39,430 --> 00:42:42,343
If Mr. Molesley deserves
the first prize for his flowers,

652
00:42:42,433 --> 00:42:45,677
-the judges will give it to him.
-They wouldn't dare.

653
00:42:45,771 --> 00:42:47,853
Really, Robert. You make me so annoyed.

654
00:42:47,939 --> 00:42:50,191
Isn't it possible
I should win the thing on merit?

655
00:42:50,275 --> 00:42:53,860
I think the appropriate answer
to that, Mama, is, "Yes, dear".

656
00:42:56,449 --> 00:42:58,282
I don't know why we're bothering.

657
00:42:58,369 --> 00:43:01,737
-We'll have missed the speeches as it is.
-Don't be such a grouch.

658
00:43:02,247 --> 00:43:05,411
You should have punished
one of them at least.

659
00:43:06,211 --> 00:43:09,374
They know that I know,
that's worth something.

660
00:43:12,385 --> 00:43:14,797
What do you think will happen
to Mrs. Patmore?

661
00:43:15,221 --> 00:43:18,054
She'll muddle through with Daisy for help.

662
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:21,144
In the long term, we'll just have to wait
for the doctor to give his opinion.

663
00:43:21,228 --> 00:43:23,811
I hope there's something they can do.

664
00:43:23,897 --> 00:43:25,558
I hope so, too.

665
00:43:25,649 --> 00:43:28,984
But if there isn't,
I hope they tell her there isn't.

666
00:43:29,112 --> 00:43:32,195
Nothing is harder to live with
than false hope.

667
00:43:32,323 --> 00:43:34,656
I wish you'd just come out with it.

668
00:43:36,328 --> 00:43:37,693
With what?

669
00:43:38,288 --> 00:43:40,155
Whatever it is you're keeping secret.

670
00:43:45,672 --> 00:43:47,004
I can't.

671
00:43:49,009 --> 00:43:52,172
-You don't deny it, then?
-No, I don't deny it.

672
00:43:53,222 --> 00:43:55,555
And I don't deny you've a right to ask.

673
00:43:55,684 --> 00:43:57,140
But I can't.

674
00:43:58,687 --> 00:44:00,474
I'm not a free man.

675
00:44:03,192 --> 00:44:05,900
Are you trying to tell me
that you're married?

676
00:44:06,028 --> 00:44:09,488
I have been married, yes.
But that's not all of it.

677
00:44:09,741 --> 00:44:11,197
Because...

678
00:44:13,370 --> 00:44:15,703
Because I love you, Mr. Bates.

679
00:44:16,499 --> 00:44:19,082
I know it's not ladylike to say it,

680
00:44:19,878 --> 00:44:23,042
but I'm not a lady and
I don't pretend to be.

681
00:44:26,927 --> 00:44:30,922
You are a lady to me.
And I never knew a finer one.

682
00:44:35,688 --> 00:44:39,181
If you want a lift,
I can take one of you, but not more.

683
00:44:39,275 --> 00:44:41,687
-One of the women.
-No, you must go.

684
00:44:41,777 --> 00:44:44,827
-Then we can all hurry and meet you there.
-Yes, you're right.

685
00:44:45,407 --> 00:44:47,444
I mustn't slow you down.

686
00:44:48,243 --> 00:44:51,032
There's been too much of that already.

687
00:45:12,813 --> 00:45:15,225
Have you recovered from our ordeal?

688
00:45:15,316 --> 00:45:17,058
I got a letter this morning.

689
00:45:17,152 --> 00:45:20,315
They must have written it
as soon as I left the office.

690
00:45:20,447 --> 00:45:22,233
They are pleased to have met me,

691
00:45:22,324 --> 00:45:27,946
but I do not quite fit their requirements.
So it was all for nothing.

692
00:45:28,164 --> 00:45:29,780
I don't agree.

693
00:45:29,916 --> 00:45:32,210
Only a fool doesn't know
when they've been beaten.

694
00:45:32,294 --> 00:45:35,787
Then I'm a fool, for I'm a long way
from being beaten yet.

695
00:45:42,639 --> 00:45:45,684
When you ran off last night,
I hope you hadn't thought me rude.

696
00:45:45,768 --> 00:45:49,396
Certainly not. I monopolized you at dinner.
I'd no right to any more of your time.

697
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:51,768
You see, Edith and I
had this sort of bet...

698
00:45:51,858 --> 00:45:53,849
Please don't apologize.

699
00:45:54,194 --> 00:45:57,983
I had a lovely evening
and I'm glad we're on speaking terms.

700
00:45:58,323 --> 00:46:00,941
Now, I should look after my mother.

701
00:46:04,789 --> 00:46:08,033
Why was Cousin Matthew
in such a hurry to get away?

702
00:46:08,168 --> 00:46:09,784
Don't be stupid.

703
00:46:09,878 --> 00:46:13,122
I suppose you didn't want him
when he wanted you,

704
00:46:13,216 --> 00:46:15,503
and now it's the other way round.

705
00:46:15,677 --> 00:46:17,884
You have to admit it's quite funny.

706
00:46:18,013 --> 00:46:20,426
I'll admit that if I ever wanted
to attract a man

707
00:46:20,516 --> 00:46:23,634
I'd steer clear of those
clothes and that hat.

708
00:46:23,728 --> 00:46:26,596
You think yourself so superior, don't you?

709
00:46:26,690 --> 00:46:27,725
[MARY GROANS]

710
00:46:35,199 --> 00:46:39,693
Well, I think she who laughs last
laughs longest.

711
00:46:40,205 --> 00:46:42,617
CORA: Did that missing box of yours
ever turn up?

712
00:46:42,708 --> 00:46:44,108
It was a fuss about nothing.

713
00:46:44,209 --> 00:46:46,503
They must've put it back on the
wrong shelf when they were dusting.

714
00:46:46,587 --> 00:46:48,249
Bates found it this morning.

715
00:46:48,381 --> 00:46:51,794
Next time, have a proper look
before you start complaining.

716
00:46:51,885 --> 00:46:54,012
I'm sure the servants
were frightened half to death.

717
00:46:54,096 --> 00:46:55,586
<i>Mea culpa.</i>

718
00:47:04,691 --> 00:47:08,560
And now, the Grantham Cup
for the best bloom in the village.

719
00:47:09,113 --> 00:47:12,071
And the Grantham Cup is awarded to...

720
00:47:26,883 --> 00:47:28,750
Mr. William Molesley

721
00:47:30,596 --> 00:47:33,384
for his Comtesse Cabarrus rose.

722
00:47:35,977 --> 00:47:39,060
Bravo! Well done! Bravo!

723
00:47:48,950 --> 00:47:52,740
-Congratulations, Mr. Molesley.
-Thank you, my lady.

724
00:47:53,122 --> 00:47:54,954
Thank you for letting me have it.

725
00:47:55,082 --> 00:47:58,417
It is the judges who decide these things,
not me.

726
00:47:58,837 --> 00:48:00,669
But very well done.

727
00:48:07,638 --> 00:48:09,299
Congratulations!

728
00:48:10,642 --> 00:48:13,976
Bravo, Mama.
That must have been a real sacrifice.

729
00:48:14,354 --> 00:48:15,970
And bravely borne.

730
00:48:16,106 --> 00:48:18,064
I don't know what everyone's on about.

731
00:48:18,151 --> 00:48:20,609
-But I...
-All is well, my dear.

732
00:48:20,778 --> 00:48:22,189
All is well.
