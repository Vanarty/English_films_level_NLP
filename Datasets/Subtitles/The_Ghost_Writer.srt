discover how i died

395
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:17,120
probable suicide just doesn't cut it

396
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,799
actually i was hoping they'd send

397
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:20,799
someone different you know

398
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:24,159
tall dark handsome

399
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:26,159
but since you're a relative and all i

400
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:28,880
guess you're it

401
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:32,880

402
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:43,840

no reason hey are you okay

406
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:57,840
you look like you've just seen a ghost

407
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,880

408
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:04,080

409
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,960

412
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,360
yeah yeah yeah i guess so then you think

413
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:21,760
it's

414
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,919
possible that a person's spirit could

415
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:27,360
come back and visit the living

416
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:29,200

417
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,480
things don't happen every day

418
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:37,520
i beg your pardon what would you do if

419
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:40,240
the ghost of a famous movie star

420
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,559

762
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:59,119
the ouija board could type out the

763
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:00,400

from so we made up the diary

1195
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:23,120
whoever kidnapped tom must think that

1196
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:24,080
billy had written something

1197
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:25,839
incriminating about him

1198
01:09:25,839 --> 01:09:30,000
it's got to be someone she knows bj

1199
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:33,279
you've got to help me call her back me

1200
01:09:33,279 --> 01:09:35,120
