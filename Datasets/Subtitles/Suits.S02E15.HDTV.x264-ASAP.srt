1
00:00:00,094 --> 00:00:01,256
Previously on... <i>Suits</i>

2
00:00:01,257 --> 00:00:03,203
Katrina Bennett said she'd put
the deal through

3
00:00:03,204 --> 00:00:04,205
if you offered her a job.

4
00:00:04,322 --> 00:00:05,322
You bribed her.

5
00:00:05,323 --> 00:00:06,973
You bet your ass I did.

6
00:00:06,974 --> 00:00:08,942
I decided to farm out the case.

7
00:00:08,943 --> 00:00:11,612
Let me guess... Daniel Hardman.

8
00:00:11,613 --> 00:00:13,664
[Whispering] He's baiting you
into breaching confidentiality.

9
00:00:13,665 --> 00:00:15,949
And I'm ready to bite down
and drag him in with me.

10
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:17,918
She was younger than you,
prettier than you,

11
00:00:17,919 --> 00:00:19,503
and of child-bearing age...

12
00:00:19,504 --> 00:00:23,123
all of the things you are not,
and you fired her for it.

13
00:00:23,124 --> 00:00:24,824
You can't be
the named defendant

14
00:00:24,825 --> 00:00:26,660
on a gender-discrimination case

15
00:00:26,661 --> 00:00:29,179
while we're suing Folsom Foods
for the same thing.

16
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:31,965
I am not capitulating
to that man.

17
00:00:31,966 --> 00:00:34,885
You have 45 cases
you can't afford.

18
00:00:34,886 --> 00:00:37,638
Any way you slice it,
I'm going to bleed you dry.

19
00:00:37,639 --> 00:00:39,690
I put my reputation
on the line to close Maria.

20
00:00:39,691 --> 00:00:44,228
- Sheila, please.
- I think you should go.

21
00:00:44,229 --> 00:00:46,146
Meet Ms. Dana Scott.

22
00:00:46,147 --> 00:00:47,281
- Scottie.
- Harvey.

23
00:00:47,282 --> 00:00:48,315
Oh, you two know each other?

24
00:00:48,316 --> 00:00:49,900
We went to Harvard Law
together.

25
00:00:49,901 --> 00:00:51,985
I've been here longer
than 75% of our associates,

26
00:00:51,986 --> 00:00:53,186
and I love it,

27
00:00:53,187 --> 00:00:54,738
and that's what I told them
in my essay.

28
00:00:54,739 --> 00:00:56,206
I'm going to Harvard.

29
00:00:56,207 --> 00:00:59,042
When I get back to London,
I'm getting married, Harvey.

30
00:00:59,043 --> 00:01:00,544
What would you like me to say?

31
00:01:02,997 --> 00:01:06,049
I'm Hanley Folsom,
President of Folsom Foods.

32
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:09,002
Recently we've been victim
to terrible allegations

33
00:01:09,003 --> 00:01:11,255
that we've been discriminating
against women.

34
00:01:11,256 --> 00:01:13,507
We're in places
like Marysville,

35
00:01:13,508 --> 00:01:16,710
places where women want
more than just jobs.

36
00:01:16,711 --> 00:01:20,681
They want homes, families,
and we support that.

37
00:01:20,682 --> 00:01:23,517
And if they want advancement,
we support that too.

38
00:01:23,518 --> 00:01:24,518
Got to give it to him.

39
00:01:24,519 --> 00:01:25,602
His food might suck,

40
00:01:25,603 --> 00:01:27,387
but he makes
a mean bullshit pie.

41
00:01:27,388 --> 00:01:29,189
Okay, please don't put
that image in my mind.

42
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:30,390
I'm eating. Thank you.

43
00:01:30,391 --> 00:01:33,193
What've you got there...
vomit bagel...

44
00:01:33,194 --> 00:01:35,245
Feces pancakes?

45
00:01:35,246 --> 00:01:36,580
Look, I don't care
what he says.

46
00:01:36,581 --> 00:01:38,115
This is a man
who won't promote women.

47
00:01:38,116 --> 00:01:39,666
I want to steal a page
from your book.

48
00:01:39,667 --> 00:01:41,785
I already checked. There's
no hot-mic footage from this.

49
00:01:41,786 --> 00:01:43,086
Then interview the cameraman

50
00:01:43,087 --> 00:01:44,738
or the sound guy,
whatever it takes.

51
00:01:44,739 --> 00:01:46,089
We need to catch this guy
in a lie.

52
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:48,091
I already tried
to hire an investigator.

53
00:01:48,092 --> 00:01:49,710
The authorization
got kicked back.

54
00:01:49,711 --> 00:01:52,212
Do it anyway.
I'll take care of it.

55
00:01:52,213 --> 00:01:55,382
We need to talk
about resources.

56
00:01:55,383 --> 00:01:56,850
We do.

57
00:01:56,851 --> 00:01:58,585
I hear clients' calls
aren't being returned.

58
00:01:58,586 --> 00:02:01,087
Hardman put seven cases
on the fast track.

59
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:02,422
The rest have to take
a backseat.

60
00:02:02,423 --> 00:02:04,274
We can't just hang our clients
out to dry.

61
00:02:04,275 --> 00:02:05,525
We won't.

62
00:02:05,526 --> 00:02:07,644
At 10:00 a.m.,
the library will be packed.

63
00:02:07,645 --> 00:02:10,063
Instead of returning 113 calls,

64
00:02:10,064 --> 00:02:11,148
I'm going to take an hour

65
00:02:11,149 --> 00:02:12,566
and give them
the state of the union.

66
00:02:12,567 --> 00:02:14,284
- Oh, good.
- Not good enough.

67
00:02:14,285 --> 00:02:16,153
I need 40 more
contract lawyers,

68
00:02:16,154 --> 00:02:17,321
a dozen paralegals,

69
00:02:17,322 --> 00:02:18,572
and Mike Ross just told me

70
00:02:18,573 --> 00:02:20,240
he couldn't even hire
an investigator.

71
00:02:20,241 --> 00:02:21,274
That's right. He can't.

72
00:02:21,275 --> 00:02:22,709
- We have to.
- No.

73
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:25,078
- We need to invest in this.
- Did you hear me?

74
00:02:25,079 --> 00:02:27,280
We bit this off.
We need to chew.

75
00:02:27,281 --> 00:02:29,115
You're like a toddler. No.

76
00:02:29,116 --> 00:02:31,084
All of these are bills.

77
00:02:31,085 --> 00:02:32,919
We knew what we were
getting into.

78
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,621
And then we took a hit
from Monica Eton

79
00:02:34,622 --> 00:02:36,122
and hired the contract lawyers.

80
00:02:36,123 --> 00:02:37,123
We are out of money.

81
00:02:37,124 --> 00:02:39,092
Use the line of credit.

82
00:02:39,093 --> 00:02:40,594
It's gone.

83
00:02:40,595 --> 00:02:43,647
What?

84
00:02:43,648 --> 00:02:46,733
They have evaluated
the situation,

85
00:02:46,734 --> 00:02:48,185
and they know we're bleeding.

86
00:02:48,186 --> 00:02:51,772
So we've got seven cases
in seven cities

87
00:02:51,773 --> 00:02:54,140
over the next two months.

88
00:02:54,141 --> 00:02:57,611
So what are you proposing I do?

89
00:02:57,612 --> 00:03:01,748
Okay, what do you have for me?

90
00:03:01,749 --> 00:03:02,949
Rachel.

91
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:04,334
Rachel?

92
00:03:04,335 --> 00:03:06,169
What's going on?
What are you doing?

93
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:08,255
- I'm working.
- On what?

94
00:03:08,256 --> 00:03:10,007
One of the seven cases
is in Massapequa,

95
00:03:10,008 --> 00:03:11,792
so I'm seeing
if one of the cities nearby

96
00:03:11,793 --> 00:03:13,293
might have
a private investigator.

97
00:03:13,294 --> 00:03:15,295
Okay, so that's a map
of Boston.

98
00:03:15,296 --> 00:03:18,298
You're on what we commonly
refer to as the Internet.

99
00:03:18,299 --> 00:03:19,499
And then, up here,

100
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,301
you would just write
"private investigator."

101
00:03:21,302 --> 00:03:22,686
But then
I wouldn't be able to see

102
00:03:22,687 --> 00:03:24,388
what part of town
I want to live in

103
00:03:24,389 --> 00:03:27,024
when I go to Harvard.

104
00:03:27,025 --> 00:03:29,393
Okay, so basically
you haven't been working

105
00:03:29,394 --> 00:03:32,178
for the last, what, 15 minutes?

106
00:03:32,179 --> 00:03:34,231
Half hour...

107
00:03:34,232 --> 00:03:35,282
45 minutes.

108
00:03:35,283 --> 00:03:36,349
- Come on.
- I am sorry.

109
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:37,701
I don't deal well with waiting.

110
00:03:37,702 --> 00:03:40,287
You've done everything
that you can do, all right?

111
00:03:40,288 --> 00:03:41,455
You killed the LSATs.

112
00:03:41,456 --> 00:03:43,707
You had a great interview.
You're a legacy.

113
00:03:43,708 --> 00:03:45,158
You're smoking hot.

114
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:46,493
They don't let people in
because they're hot.

115
00:03:46,494 --> 00:03:47,994
I would.

116
00:03:47,995 --> 00:03:50,697
You do realize we're working
on a gender-discrimination case.

117
00:03:50,698 --> 00:03:52,198
That's what I'm doing...
working.

118
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:55,201
And hopefully that's
what you'll be doing now too.

119
00:03:55,202 --> 00:03:56,703
Change of plans.

120
00:03:56,704 --> 00:03:59,372
Welcome to the team, hottie.

121
00:03:59,373 --> 00:04:01,007
We're consolidating resources.

122
00:04:01,008 --> 00:04:02,676
Jessica didn't approve
the investigator?

123
00:04:02,677 --> 00:04:04,428
Jessica approved
anything we want,

124
00:04:04,429 --> 00:04:05,762
for one case.

125
00:04:05,763 --> 00:04:07,397
What?
No, we have to fight them all.

126
00:04:07,398 --> 00:04:08,482
And we will.

127
00:04:08,483 --> 00:04:10,851
By letting six of them go?

128
00:04:10,852 --> 00:04:12,552
Do you know
how we won World War II?

129
00:04:12,553 --> 00:04:14,688
Yeah, of course. Spock didn't
let Kirk save Joan Collins

130
00:04:14,689 --> 00:04:15,989
from getting hit by that car.

131
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:17,557
Wrong. We'd already won.

132
00:04:17,558 --> 00:04:19,693
Kirk just would have changed
the course of history.

133
00:04:19,694 --> 00:04:20,861
I accept that.

134
00:04:20,862 --> 00:04:23,113
Eisenhower had 156,000 men

135
00:04:23,114 --> 00:04:26,199
for 8 possible invasion points,
which means...

136
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:30,036
- 19,500 men per point.
- Otherwise known as nothing.

137
00:04:30,037 --> 00:04:33,874
He had to put everything
that he had into one attack...

138
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:35,542
[Snaps fingers] Normandy.

139
00:04:35,543 --> 00:04:37,761
So the question is,
where the hell is our Normandy?

140
00:04:37,762 --> 00:04:39,963
That's easy. Bakersfield.

141
00:04:39,964 --> 00:04:42,382
Lowest percentage
of female promotions...

142
00:04:42,383 --> 00:04:43,934
Highest percentage
of female applicants.

143
00:04:43,935 --> 00:04:46,219
And Hanley Folsom's
brother-in-law runs the plant.

144
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,721
Exactly.

145
00:04:47,722 --> 00:04:50,223
You want to launch an attack,
you launch it from Bakersfield.

146
00:04:50,224 --> 00:04:51,758
Hey, am I Spock or Kirk?

147
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:52,759
Uhura.

148
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:55,145
Walked right into it.

149
00:04:55,146 --> 00:04:58,448
I got you an espresso,
quad shot.

150
00:04:58,449 --> 00:05:00,367
- I don't need coffee.
- You might.

151
00:05:01,986 --> 00:05:04,154
I'm fine.

152
00:05:04,155 --> 00:05:05,155
What?

153
00:05:05,156 --> 00:05:07,791
Oh, your suit's a little...

154
00:05:07,792 --> 00:05:10,243
It's a client meeting,
not a bachelor auction.

155
00:05:10,244 --> 00:05:11,795
Yeah, about that...

156
00:05:11,796 --> 00:05:13,330
What, are there too many
clients to fit in the library?

157
00:05:13,331 --> 00:05:14,781
We're using
the conference room.

158
00:05:14,782 --> 00:05:17,784
- They won't all fit.
- They will.

159
00:05:17,785 --> 00:05:19,503
There's been
a slight complication.

160
00:05:19,504 --> 00:05:20,921
Donna...

161
00:05:20,922 --> 00:05:24,224
You will understand
when you get there.

162
00:05:32,433 --> 00:05:34,651
Now you're ready.

163
00:05:34,652 --> 00:05:35,936
Donna.

164
00:05:35,937 --> 00:05:38,522
Scottie? Harvey.

165
00:05:38,523 --> 00:05:41,307
- How's married life?
- I wouldn't know.

166
00:05:41,308 --> 00:05:43,326
Divorced so soon?

167
00:05:43,327 --> 00:05:45,862
I never took the plunge.

168
00:05:45,863 --> 00:05:47,497
Oh, get over yourself.

169
00:05:47,498 --> 00:05:49,449
I know I came here last time
with cold feet

170
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:51,034
and blubbered over you
like a 15-year-old,

171
00:05:51,035 --> 00:05:52,702
but it wasn't about you.

172
00:05:52,703 --> 00:05:53,837
It was about me.

173
00:05:53,838 --> 00:05:56,206
So what's it about this time?

174
00:05:56,207 --> 00:05:57,424
Bakersfield.

175
00:05:57,425 --> 00:05:59,376
You are not taking
my clients, Scottie.

176
00:05:59,377 --> 00:06:01,294
We already did.

177
00:06:01,295 --> 00:06:03,180
Like taking candy
from a little Harvard baby.

178
00:06:03,181 --> 00:06:04,330
You just said
it wasn't about me.

179
00:06:04,331 --> 00:06:05,432
Harvey,
Bakersfield is everything,

180
00:06:05,433 --> 00:06:06,633
and I've got them.

181
00:06:06,634 --> 00:06:08,051
I've also got appointments
with the rest.

182
00:06:08,052 --> 00:06:10,270
So I can spend time going
after them and get 20 more,

183
00:06:10,271 --> 00:06:14,140
or you could let me have 10
and we call it a day.

184
00:06:14,141 --> 00:06:15,508
Well, why don't I just
give it all to you?

185
00:06:15,509 --> 00:06:16,860
My cases, office,
my wallet, my keys...

186
00:06:16,861 --> 00:06:19,396
It's not personal.
It's just business.

187
00:06:19,397 --> 00:06:22,315
- Yeah, my business.
- Good business.

188
00:06:22,316 --> 00:06:24,183
The answer is no.

189
00:06:24,184 --> 00:06:26,570
Well, there's no harm
in asking.

190
00:06:26,571 --> 00:06:28,354
It's good to see you, though.

191
00:06:28,355 --> 00:06:30,624
[Laughs] You look great.

192
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:32,191
A bit overworked, but...

193
00:06:32,192 --> 00:06:35,896

You've got to be kidding me.
She took Bakersfield?

204
00:07:13,764 --> 00:07:15,181
And she's looking for ten more.

205
00:07:15,182 --> 00:07:18,151
A woman that goes after
what she wants.

206
00:07:18,152 --> 00:07:20,353
- You sound impressed.
- You don't.

207
00:07:20,354 --> 00:07:22,638
I already work with a woman
like that every day.

208
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:25,191
Maybe I should have hired her
when I had the chance.

209
00:07:25,192 --> 00:07:26,493
What chance?

210
00:07:26,494 --> 00:07:28,077
There was one opening
that year,

211
00:07:28,078 --> 00:07:29,779
and she was the best on paper,

212
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:31,531
but I had already
invested so much in you

213
00:07:31,532 --> 00:07:33,867
that I decided to get a return
on my investment.

214
00:07:33,868 --> 00:07:35,585
Which is what I'm going
to give you right now,

215
00:07:35,586 --> 00:07:38,037
even though you don't have
any more money to invest.

216
00:07:38,038 --> 00:07:39,539
Are you back to resources?

217
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:43,159
Because I've had enough
of hearing about our weaknesses.

218
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:47,263
I'm talking about turning it
into one of our strengths.

219
00:07:47,264 --> 00:07:48,932
I'm listening.

220
00:07:48,933 --> 00:07:50,467
Hardman knows we're tapped out.

221
00:07:50,468 --> 00:07:51,768
He's counting on it.

222
00:07:51,769 --> 00:07:53,186
What if we're not?
What if we're flush?

223
00:07:53,187 --> 00:07:55,472
Are you talking
about joining forces with her?

224
00:07:55,473 --> 00:07:57,223
With her firm...

225
00:07:57,224 --> 00:08:00,360
Her infinitely
deep-pocketed firm.

226
00:08:00,361 --> 00:08:03,012
Harvey, she wanted ten cases.

227
00:08:03,013 --> 00:08:05,398
You're talking
about sharing 45,

228
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:06,900
and I've never known you
to share.

229
00:08:06,901 --> 00:08:09,202
They're based in London,
so we'll be running the show.

230
00:08:09,203 --> 00:08:10,737
They'll just be signing
the checks.

231
00:08:10,738 --> 00:08:12,539
And taking a cut
of the winnings.

232
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:14,624
Exactly. Winnings.

233
00:08:14,625 --> 00:08:16,025
It's the best way
to beat Hardman.

234
00:08:16,026 --> 00:08:19,078
And the side benefit is
you don't lose to Scottie.

235
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:21,915
Nothing wrong
with a side benefit.

236
00:08:21,916 --> 00:08:24,384
Fine. Don't lose to her.

237
00:08:24,385 --> 00:08:27,253
But you better make damn sure
that you don't lose with her.

238
00:08:39,817 --> 00:08:40,900
Good. You're here.

239
00:08:40,901 --> 00:08:42,235
I'm taking the personnel files,

240
00:08:42,236 --> 00:08:43,736
you go through
the corporate minutes, and...

241
00:08:43,737 --> 00:08:45,738
Excuse me?

242
00:08:45,739 --> 00:08:47,941
Bakersfield.
We don't have all day.

243
00:08:47,942 --> 00:08:49,943
[Scoffs]

244
00:08:49,944 --> 00:08:54,030
I'm... I'm sorry. I didn't know
you were on Bakersfield.

245
00:08:54,031 --> 00:08:56,332
Well, I am. Let's go.

246
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:57,567
The minutes are over there,

247
00:08:57,568 --> 00:08:59,202
and they're not going
to read themselves.

248
00:08:59,203 --> 00:09:01,237
Okay, well, you may be
on Bakersfield,

249
00:09:01,238 --> 00:09:03,256
but I'm the lead
on Bakersfield,

250
00:09:03,257 --> 00:09:04,874
and we're not going to do any
of that stuff

251
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:07,076
until we get Harvey
some up-to-date statistics.

252
00:09:07,077 --> 00:09:11,514
4.7% female executives...
up to date.

253
00:09:11,515 --> 00:09:12,799
That's a number.

254
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,884
We need the probability
of that ratio being chance

255
00:09:14,885 --> 00:09:17,887
across 22 divisions
in 45 states, which is one...

256
00:09:17,888 --> 00:09:19,722
One in 8.3 billion.

257
00:09:19,723 --> 00:09:21,391
How did you know that?

258
00:09:21,392 --> 00:09:23,059
I checked
with the statistician.

259
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:25,228
Yeah, well, he's wrong,
because he didn't...

260
00:09:25,229 --> 00:09:27,063
Adjust for outliers,
which takes it to...

261
00:09:27,064 --> 00:09:29,899
One in 6.4 billion.

262
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:33,236
- How did you know that?
- I did it in my head.

263
00:09:33,237 --> 00:09:34,904
It's what I do.

264
00:09:34,905 --> 00:09:36,439
It's why I'm lead,

265
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:39,208
and if you don't know,
you better ask somebody.

266
00:09:39,209 --> 00:09:41,244
I don't need to ask anybody

267
00:09:41,245 --> 00:09:43,496
to know that if we use
the 8.3 billion number,

268
00:09:43,497 --> 00:09:44,614
it's defensible,

269
00:09:44,615 --> 00:09:46,132
and it skews the results
in our favor.

270
00:09:46,133 --> 00:09:47,584
Oh, what a shock.

271
00:09:47,585 --> 00:09:48,668
You want to skew the results

272
00:09:48,669 --> 00:09:50,253
at the expense
of our credibility.

273
00:09:50,254 --> 00:09:51,638
We're not doing it.

274
00:09:51,639 --> 00:09:54,757
- I am a fifth year, Mike.
- And I work for Harvey.

275
00:09:54,758 --> 00:09:57,260
Well, Jessica assigned me.

276
00:09:57,261 --> 00:10:01,764
And if you don't like that,
why don't you go talk to her?

277
00:10:01,765 --> 00:10:03,516
I don't want to work
with Katrina.

278
00:10:03,517 --> 00:10:04,901
She comes in. She takes over.

279
00:10:04,902 --> 00:10:06,402
She acts like everything
is her idea.

280
00:10:06,403 --> 00:10:07,687
Then we're in the same boat,

281
00:10:07,688 --> 00:10:09,272
'cause I don't want
to work with Scottie.

282
00:10:09,273 --> 00:10:11,024
- We're working with Scottie?
- I'm working with Scottie.

283
00:10:11,025 --> 00:10:12,442
She's coming
to Bakersfield with us?

284
00:10:12,443 --> 00:10:13,993
She's coming
to Bakersfield with me.

285
00:10:13,994 --> 00:10:15,278
How can you do that to me?

286
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:17,246
I didn't do it to you.
She did. She stole them.

287
00:10:17,247 --> 00:10:19,315
- Wait. What?
- Relax, okay?

288
00:10:19,316 --> 00:10:20,833
You're going to go
on another road trip someday.

289
00:10:20,834 --> 00:10:22,251
No, Harvey,
you're not getting it.

290
00:10:22,252 --> 00:10:24,787
We're going
to lose World War II.

291
00:10:26,423 --> 00:10:28,541
What do you want?

292
00:10:28,542 --> 00:10:29,959
Coffee? Tea?

293
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,327
I'm good, thanks.

294
00:10:31,328 --> 00:10:34,631
A woman who wants nothing...
I distrust that.

295
00:10:34,632 --> 00:10:36,849
Who said I want nothing?

296
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:38,334
Oh, no one's ever said that
about you.

297
00:10:38,335 --> 00:10:39,886
Oh, what have they said?

298
00:10:39,887 --> 00:10:41,854
"They"?

299
00:10:41,855 --> 00:10:43,690
You.

300
00:10:43,691 --> 00:10:45,308
My opinion matters to you?

301
00:10:45,309 --> 00:10:47,226
Your opinion matters to him.

302
00:10:47,227 --> 00:10:49,345
I've only ever said
good things about you, Scottie.

303
00:10:49,346 --> 00:10:51,347
But what have you thought?

304
00:10:51,348 --> 00:10:53,849
Just don't screw with him.

305
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:56,819
Don't screw with him,
or don't screw him?

306
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:59,122
Are you able to do one
without the other?

307
00:10:59,123 --> 00:11:00,823
The other what?

308
00:11:00,824 --> 00:11:04,327
I'll leave you two to business.

309
00:11:04,328 --> 00:11:06,162
So are you going
to take me up on my offer,

310
00:11:06,163 --> 00:11:07,380
or are you going to fight me?

311
00:11:07,381 --> 00:11:09,132
You tell me.

312
00:11:09,133 --> 00:11:10,883
I think neither.

313
00:11:10,884 --> 00:11:12,702
I think you want us
to try the cases together

314
00:11:12,703 --> 00:11:15,088
and let my firm
bankroll the litigation.

315
00:11:15,089 --> 00:11:17,090
Which is exactly
what you wanted the whole time.

316
00:11:17,091 --> 00:11:20,376
You got me.
We'll start with Bakersfield.

317
00:11:20,377 --> 00:11:22,878
You couldn't just go
for the direct approach?

318
00:11:22,879 --> 00:11:25,098
You don't respond
to the direct approach, Harvey.

319
00:11:25,099 --> 00:11:27,400
You like to feel you can come
to things on your own.

320
00:11:27,401 --> 00:11:29,385
Which is why we're not
starting with Bakersfield.

321
00:11:29,386 --> 00:11:32,105
- It's the clear choice.
- Exactly.

322
00:11:32,106 --> 00:11:34,223
You knew it,
my first year knew it,

323
00:11:34,224 --> 00:11:35,408
and so will Hardman.

324
00:11:35,409 --> 00:11:37,410
- I'm not afraid of Hardman.
- You should be.

325
00:11:37,411 --> 00:11:39,895
And that's why
we're going to Parkville.

326
00:11:39,896 --> 00:11:41,497
You mean the one division
with a female manager

327
00:11:41,498 --> 00:11:43,082
and the best ratio
of women executives

328
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:44,617
in the entire company?

329
00:11:44,618 --> 00:11:45,868
No, I mean the one division

330
00:11:45,869 --> 00:11:47,704
where Hardman will never think
to find us.

331
00:11:47,705 --> 00:11:49,205
Because it's
the dumbest place to start

332
00:11:49,206 --> 00:11:50,590
and the hardest place to win.

333
00:11:50,591 --> 00:11:53,960
And when we win it,
all the others will surrender.

334
00:11:53,961 --> 00:11:55,411
What a surprise...

335
00:11:55,412 --> 00:11:57,513
Harvey Specter wants
to do things the hard way.

336
00:11:57,514 --> 00:11:58,881
What a surprise...

337
00:11:58,882 --> 00:12:00,717
Dana Scott's looking
for the shortcut.

338
00:12:00,718 --> 00:12:03,252
And what makes you think
that he's not going to find out

339
00:12:03,253 --> 00:12:04,754
that we're not still going
to Bakersfield?

340
00:12:04,755 --> 00:12:06,255
We're still going
to Bakersfield.

341
00:12:06,256 --> 00:12:08,057
We book a plane, a hotel,

342
00:12:08,058 --> 00:12:10,860
line up depositions there
and in all seven cities.

343
00:12:10,861 --> 00:12:14,363
That plan isn't worthy
of our kind of money.

344
00:12:14,364 --> 00:12:17,734
If you want
to overwhelm Hardman...

345
00:12:17,735 --> 00:12:20,987
We go to all 45 cities...

346
00:12:20,988 --> 00:12:24,607
Which is exactly
what you wanted the whole time.

347
00:12:24,608 --> 00:12:26,609
You got me.

348
00:12:28,796 --> 00:12:32,782
Hey, um, I just wanted
to say I'm sorry

349
00:12:32,783 --> 00:12:33,883
and that you were right.

350
00:12:33,884 --> 00:12:35,134
Jessica assigned you,

351
00:12:35,135 --> 00:12:37,953
so you should take the lead
on Bakersfield.

352
00:12:37,954 --> 00:12:40,623
What are you going to do?

353
00:12:40,624 --> 00:12:42,592
I've got other things.
I'll be fine.

354
00:12:42,593 --> 00:12:45,511
Good. You're both here.
Change of plan.

355
00:12:45,512 --> 00:12:47,013
Uh, no need.
I already know, so...

356
00:12:47,014 --> 00:12:48,681
This isn't about Parkville.

357
00:12:48,682 --> 00:12:50,566
I'm deposing Hanley Folsom
in 36 hours,

358
00:12:50,567 --> 00:12:52,819
and I need to know more
about him than his mistress does

359
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:54,303
before he gets here.

360
00:12:54,304 --> 00:12:55,688
He has a mistress?

361
00:12:55,689 --> 00:12:57,406
That would help, wouldn't it?

362
00:12:57,407 --> 00:13:00,443
And you should already know,
since you asked on this case.

363
00:13:00,444 --> 00:13:03,329
Now find me something.

364
00:13:05,415 --> 00:13:06,866
What are you pissed about now?

365
00:13:06,867 --> 00:13:10,119
Jessica assigned you?
No, you asked.

366
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,654
I asked, and she assigned me.

367
00:13:11,655 --> 00:13:12,988
That's how it works.

368
00:13:12,989 --> 00:13:15,174
When you phrased it to me,
you picked language

369
00:13:15,175 --> 00:13:18,177
that skewed a little bit
in your favor.

370
00:13:18,178 --> 00:13:20,546
Like you just said,
"I've got other things,"

371
00:13:20,547 --> 00:13:22,932
instead of telling me
the focus of the entire case

372
00:13:22,933 --> 00:13:24,467
apparently just moved
to Parkville,

373
00:13:24,468 --> 00:13:26,469
which I don't have
a problem with,

374
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:28,137
but clearly
you have a problem with me.

375
00:13:28,138 --> 00:13:30,840
My problem with you
is how you got here.

376
00:13:30,841 --> 00:13:32,141
That's funny,

377
00:13:32,142 --> 00:13:33,976
because my problem with you
is how I got here.

378
00:13:33,977 --> 00:13:35,144
What the hell
are you talking about?

379
00:13:35,145 --> 00:13:36,445
Harvey offered me a job,

380
00:13:36,446 --> 00:13:37,980
and I thought it was
because I'd impressed him.

381
00:13:37,981 --> 00:13:39,682
Then you showed up,
ready to break privilege,

382
00:13:39,683 --> 00:13:41,200
and I knew the real reason.

383
00:13:41,201 --> 00:13:43,870
He was hiring me
to protect you.

384
00:13:43,871 --> 00:13:45,121
Right, and then
after you found out

385
00:13:45,122 --> 00:13:46,289
the real reason for the offer,

386
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:47,406
you went to Harvey,
and you said,

387
00:13:47,407 --> 00:13:48,875
"I can't possibly accept
employment

388
00:13:48,876 --> 00:13:50,159
under those circumstances."

389
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,327
Oh, wait. No, you didn't.

390
00:13:51,328 --> 00:13:52,411
You're damn right I didn't,

391
00:13:52,412 --> 00:13:53,546
because I couldn't,

392
00:13:53,547 --> 00:13:55,498
because I had already
given notice.

393
00:13:55,499 --> 00:13:57,166
Stop taking everything
so personally

394
00:13:57,167 --> 00:13:59,051
and get over it.

395
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:03,928
Tell me you're
not having "Lear" envy.

396
00:14:05,217 --> 00:14:06,217
It's nice.

397
00:14:06,218 --> 00:14:07,251
"Nice"?

398
00:14:07,252 --> 00:14:08,603
Should we have taken your jet?

399
00:14:08,604 --> 00:14:11,088
Oh, wait. You don't have a jet.

400
00:14:11,089 --> 00:14:12,607
It's hard to park them
in Manhattan.

401
00:14:12,608 --> 00:14:15,443
Oh, right. I forgot how
provincial Pearson Hardman was...

402
00:14:15,444 --> 00:14:16,894
one office, one city.

403
00:14:16,895 --> 00:14:19,981
One office, the city.

404
00:14:22,267 --> 00:14:23,267
What?

405
00:14:23,268 --> 00:14:24,736
It just occurred to me.

406
00:14:24,737 --> 00:14:26,037
Oh, let me guess.

407
00:14:26,038 --> 00:14:28,489
There's an advantage
to being on the same side.

408
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:33,628
Well, we don't have to get
the business out of the way

409
00:14:33,629 --> 00:14:34,732
before getting to the pleasure.

410
00:14:34,733 --> 00:14:36,150
There's also a disadvantage.

411
00:14:36,151 --> 00:14:38,202
Oh, let me guess.
You have some rule.

412
00:14:38,203 --> 00:14:39,704
I don't cook in my own kitchen.

413
00:14:39,705 --> 00:14:41,355
- You cook?
- It's a metaphor.

414
00:14:41,356 --> 00:14:43,357
Yeah, I got that.
But you're in luck.

415
00:14:43,358 --> 00:14:45,543
We are not in the same kitchen.

416
00:14:45,544 --> 00:14:49,330
We are on this case.

417
00:14:49,331 --> 00:14:51,866
Somebody didn't read
the paperwork.

418
00:14:51,867 --> 00:14:54,502
When do I ever read
the paperwork?

419
00:14:54,503 --> 00:14:55,753
We're still separate entities.

420
00:14:55,754 --> 00:14:58,056
It's just a combined
legal action.

421
00:14:58,057 --> 00:14:59,390
Mm, I like the sound of that.

422
00:14:59,391 --> 00:15:01,059
I was hoping you would.

423
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:04,095
Are you going to litigate me
into sleeping with you?

424
00:15:04,096 --> 00:15:06,681
I'm going to lead you
right where you're dying to go.

425
00:15:06,682 --> 00:15:09,383
[Laughs]

426
00:15:09,384 --> 00:15:11,019
How long until we land?

427
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:13,604
Long enough.

428
00:15:13,605 --> 00:15:17,492
- Combined legal action.
- Mm-hmm.

429
00:15:17,493 --> 00:15:19,060
You know, wait.

430
00:15:19,061 --> 00:15:21,162
We didn't decide who's taking
the lead on the deposition.

431
00:15:21,163 --> 00:15:23,664
Well, we could
rock, paper, scissors for it.

432
00:15:23,665 --> 00:15:24,832
[Laughs]

433
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:25,900
Or we can do this.

434
00:15:25,901 --> 00:15:28,536
How will we know who won?

435
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:32,740
Oh, we'll know.

436
00:15:47,272 --> 00:15:48,473
Hey, sweetpants.

437
00:15:48,474 --> 00:15:49,974
I feel like
I never see you anymore,

438
00:15:49,975 --> 00:15:51,476
so I was wondering
if you want...

439
00:15:51,477 --> 00:15:54,112
oh, my God. What happened?

440
00:15:59,318 --> 00:16:00,701
You didn't get in.

441
00:16:00,702 --> 00:16:02,269
I don't want to talk about it.

442
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:03,821
I understand.

443
00:16:03,822 --> 00:16:05,873
[Knocks on glass]
Hey, Rachel, I need your help.

444
00:16:05,874 --> 00:16:07,909
Um, yes. What do you need?

445
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:09,627
I'm ready to work.

446
00:16:09,628 --> 00:16:11,996
Listen, if you need help
with any of it,

447
00:16:11,997 --> 00:16:13,915
I'm going to be at my desk.

448
00:16:13,916 --> 00:16:16,283
Thanks, Donna.

449
00:16:16,284 --> 00:16:18,669
Don't take it so personally.

450
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:19,787
What?

451
00:16:19,788 --> 00:16:21,255
That's what someone said to me.

452
00:16:21,256 --> 00:16:22,957
And whenever someone says
something's not personal,

453
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:24,759
it is, because everything
is personal.

454
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:25,843
I know.

455
00:16:25,844 --> 00:16:27,428
What do you think
Hanley Folsom's

456
00:16:27,429 --> 00:16:29,130
personal opinion is
on hiring women?

457
00:16:29,131 --> 00:16:32,299
Uh, that he doesn't think
we're good enough,

458
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:34,185
but, I mean, it's not
like he would say it out loud.

459
00:16:34,186 --> 00:16:36,971
Not at work.

460
00:16:36,972 --> 00:16:40,441
Which is why you need access
to his personal correspondence.

461
00:16:40,442 --> 00:16:42,309
- Exactly.
- That's outside the scope.

462
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:43,911
Well, let's find a way
to put it inside the scope.

463
00:16:43,912 --> 00:16:44,912
Do you have any ideas?

464
00:16:44,913 --> 00:16:46,247
No, but I have 62 boxes

465
00:16:46,248 --> 00:16:47,782
and 12 hours to find an idea.

466
00:16:47,783 --> 00:16:51,285
Exactly what I need to do...
let's go.

467
00:16:53,321 --> 00:16:55,656
- I told you I'd win.
- Maybe I let you win.

468
00:16:55,657 --> 00:16:57,758
You've never let anybody
win anything in your whole life.

469
00:16:57,759 --> 00:16:59,710
Why would you start now?

470
00:16:59,711 --> 00:17:01,379
Now I get to demand a rematch.

471
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:03,831
And I get
to lead the deposition.

472
00:17:03,832 --> 00:17:05,833
Parkville, Missouri...

473
00:17:05,834 --> 00:17:08,669
of all the places
to run into you, Harvey.

474
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:10,271
Glad you could make it.

475
00:17:10,272 --> 00:17:11,272
I almost didn't.

476
00:17:11,273 --> 00:17:12,807
I was on my way
to Bakersfield...

477
00:17:12,808 --> 00:17:15,676
after all, Harvey Specter
had a flight booked there...

478
00:17:15,677 --> 00:17:17,344
when, suddenly,
I had a thought.

479
00:17:17,345 --> 00:17:18,512
What would Harvey do?

480
00:17:18,513 --> 00:17:20,398
So I checked,

481
00:17:20,399 --> 00:17:22,366
and Dana Scott's flight plan
was here.

482
00:17:22,367 --> 00:17:27,155
Can't get around those pesky
F.A.A. regulations, can you?

483
00:17:27,156 --> 00:17:28,489
I hope you've got
all the cities covered,

484
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:30,041
'cause we've got
people everywhere.

485
00:17:30,042 --> 00:17:32,326
Deep pockets.

486
00:17:32,327 --> 00:17:33,911
Dana Scott. A pleasure.

487
00:17:33,912 --> 00:17:35,046
I can't say the same.

488
00:17:35,047 --> 00:17:36,530
You do like
strong women, Harvey.

489
00:17:36,531 --> 00:17:37,798
And you don't like women
at all.

490
00:17:37,799 --> 00:17:39,200
[Cell phone ringing]
Oh, she's cute.

491
00:17:39,201 --> 00:17:40,501
This should be fun.

492
00:17:40,502 --> 00:17:42,637
Oh, I'm just getting a call
from my niece

493
00:17:42,638 --> 00:17:45,723
who needs help
with her homework.

494
00:17:45,724 --> 00:17:46,924
What do you got?

495
00:17:46,925 --> 00:17:50,544
I know why
they promoted Cathleen Mitchell.

496
00:17:50,545 --> 00:17:52,230
What is your title,
Ms. Mitchell?

497
00:17:52,231 --> 00:17:54,565
Vice President,
Regional Services.

498
00:17:54,566 --> 00:17:56,567
And how many
management positions are there

499
00:17:56,568 --> 00:17:57,935
in your region? 612.

500
00:17:57,936 --> 00:17:59,403
And how many of those
are women?

501
00:17:59,404 --> 00:18:00,738
41.

502
00:18:00,739 --> 00:18:04,825
41 out of 612...
that's, uh, 6.6%.

503
00:18:04,826 --> 00:18:06,894
- 6.7%, if you round up.
- Let's not.

504
00:18:06,895 --> 00:18:08,496
And who sets the hiring policy?

505
00:18:08,497 --> 00:18:10,231
The hiring policy
is that we hire

506
00:18:10,232 --> 00:18:12,399
the best applicant
for each job.

507
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,668
I'm confused.

508
00:18:13,669 --> 00:18:16,003
Are women inherently
inferior, then?

509
00:18:16,004 --> 00:18:17,205
No.

510
00:18:17,206 --> 00:18:18,673
Well, then why is it
that your company

511
00:18:18,674 --> 00:18:20,708
doesn't want to promote women
into positions of power?

512
00:18:20,709 --> 00:18:22,627
I am in a position of power.

513
00:18:22,628 --> 00:18:26,347
Yes, but you're not exactly
like other women, are you?

514
00:18:26,348 --> 00:18:27,414
Harvey?

515
00:18:27,415 --> 00:18:29,800
You applied four times
for management,

516
00:18:29,801 --> 00:18:31,969
and you've been rejected
every time,

517
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:34,305
due to reviews
containing the terms

518
00:18:34,306 --> 00:18:37,975
"aggressive," "hostile,"
and "overly ambitious."

519
00:18:37,976 --> 00:18:39,593
And then, suddenly,
you were "dedicated,"

520
00:18:39,594 --> 00:18:41,779
"hardworking,"
and "a team player."

521
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:43,114
People change, Harvey.

522
00:18:43,115 --> 00:18:44,815
And the last I checked,
you have to ask a question.

523
00:18:44,816 --> 00:18:47,151
I will,
and it's about that change.

524
00:18:47,152 --> 00:18:50,037
Were you diagnosed
with uterine cancer in 2009?

525
00:18:50,038 --> 00:18:51,539
- That is not relevant.
- Are you married?

526
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:52,907
- What does that...
- Do you have any children?

527
00:18:52,908 --> 00:18:54,325
- No.
- Can you have any children?

528
00:18:54,326 --> 00:18:56,661
This is beyond the pale,
Harvey, even for you.

529
00:18:56,662 --> 00:18:58,412
Should I read your deposition
of Jessica Pearson

530
00:18:58,413 --> 00:18:59,780
from two weeks ago?

531
00:18:59,781 --> 00:19:01,966
That's a different case
and inadmissible here.

532
00:19:01,967 --> 00:19:05,119
Did you or did you not
have a hysterectomy

533
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,837
that rendered you unable
to have children

534
00:19:06,838 --> 00:19:08,472
nine months
before you were promoted?

535
00:19:08,473 --> 00:19:10,308
- She is not going to answer.
- Maybe not today.

536
00:19:10,309 --> 00:19:12,260
But it will become part
of the record.

537
00:19:12,261 --> 00:19:14,628
Hanley Folsom only promotes

538
00:19:14,629 --> 00:19:19,267
women whose attention to home
and family isn't in question.

539
00:19:19,268 --> 00:19:20,568
Except for one thing.

540
00:19:20,569 --> 00:19:22,186
Mr. Folsom didn't know.

541
00:19:22,187 --> 00:19:23,971
So you say.

542
00:19:23,972 --> 00:19:25,856
He didn't know
because I didn't tell anybody,

543
00:19:25,857 --> 00:19:27,241
because it's my business.

544
00:19:27,242 --> 00:19:29,160
Still, he found out,

545
00:19:29,161 --> 00:19:31,162
and that's why
you were promoted.

546
00:19:31,163 --> 00:19:32,413
[Whispering]
Harvey, that's enough.

547
00:19:32,414 --> 00:19:33,981
Will you look at that, Harvey?

548
00:19:33,982 --> 00:19:35,616
Even Ms. Scott understands

549
00:19:35,617 --> 00:19:37,251
that being childless
and unmarried

550
00:19:37,252 --> 00:19:41,088
doesn't make you damaged goods.

551
00:19:41,089 --> 00:19:43,324
But if that's how you're framing
your argument,

552
00:19:43,325 --> 00:19:45,159
good luck.

553
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,595
We'll see you in Bakersfield...

554
00:19:47,596 --> 00:19:49,213
And everywhere else.

555
00:19:55,437 --> 00:19:57,938
How could you not tell me
that she'd had a hysterectomy?

556
00:19:57,939 --> 00:19:59,506
Because I just got
the information

557
00:19:59,507 --> 00:20:00,858
on my way into the room.

558
00:20:00,859 --> 00:20:03,277
You could have taken
five seconds to fill me in.

559
00:20:03,278 --> 00:20:04,511
I didn't fill you in

560
00:20:04,512 --> 00:20:06,197
because I wasn't sure
you could play good cop.

561
00:20:06,198 --> 00:20:07,514
Because you weren't sure
that I could play it,

562
00:20:07,515 --> 00:20:08,849
or because even when we're
on the same side,

563
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:10,034
you still want to win?

564
00:20:10,035 --> 00:20:11,518
If I told you,
you wouldn't be pissed off.

565
00:20:11,519 --> 00:20:12,620
Now you can go to her

566
00:20:12,621 --> 00:20:14,322
and call me an asshole
with conviction.

567
00:20:14,323 --> 00:20:16,874
You're an asshole.

568
00:20:16,875 --> 00:20:19,827
Wait a second.

569
00:20:19,828 --> 00:20:23,080
You're accusing me
of still trying to win?

570
00:20:23,081 --> 00:20:25,416
You're the one who's still
trying to win something.

571
00:20:25,417 --> 00:20:27,218
You know, I should have known.

572
00:20:27,219 --> 00:20:28,669
It's never the whole story
with you.

573
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:32,056
What the hell's
really going on?

574
00:20:32,057 --> 00:20:34,425
You beat me last time.

575
00:20:34,426 --> 00:20:37,178
And ever since then,
Edward Darby hasn't seen me

576
00:20:37,179 --> 00:20:39,180
as worthy
of being a name partner.

577
00:20:39,181 --> 00:20:41,732
Cooke would never allow that
to happen, anyway.

578
00:20:41,733 --> 00:20:43,100
He can't stand Americans.

579
00:20:43,101 --> 00:20:44,402
Cooke retired,

580
00:20:44,403 --> 00:20:46,887
and he decided there's more
to life than work.

581
00:20:46,888 --> 00:20:49,056
So, if you deliver
a huge win...

582
00:20:49,057 --> 00:20:51,859
I get my name on the door.

583
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:55,913
Why didn't you
just tell me that?

584
00:20:55,914 --> 00:20:58,366
You always respond to strength,

585
00:20:58,367 --> 00:21:01,085
not weakness.

586
00:21:01,086 --> 00:21:05,005
Look at that.
You really did fool me.

587
00:21:05,006 --> 00:21:07,375
If I had known that you
were that good a performer,

588
00:21:07,376 --> 00:21:08,742
I would've let you be good cop.

589
00:21:08,743 --> 00:21:10,211
[Both laugh]

590
00:21:10,212 --> 00:21:12,713
Stop.

591
00:21:14,749 --> 00:21:17,435
Cooke really decided
there's more to life than work?

592
00:21:17,436 --> 00:21:20,187
Yep.

593
00:21:20,188 --> 00:21:22,589
Both: Pussy.

594
00:21:26,778 --> 00:21:28,262
Um, where have you been?

595
00:21:28,263 --> 00:21:29,613
- I've been right here.
- I've been waiting for you.

596
00:21:29,614 --> 00:21:31,065
I finished
going through everything.

597
00:21:31,066 --> 00:21:32,817
Me too. It's all catalogued.
It's right there.

598
00:21:32,818 --> 00:21:34,702
Okay, good,
'cause I got to get it to...

599
00:21:34,703 --> 00:21:36,070
where's 15 through 20?

600
00:21:36,071 --> 00:21:38,155
I thought that was you.

601
00:21:38,156 --> 00:21:39,773
The boxes
are right there, Rachel.

602
00:21:39,774 --> 00:21:41,325
What's the matter with you?
Come on.

603
00:21:41,326 --> 00:21:42,743
You're late.

604
00:21:42,744 --> 00:21:45,296
Katrina handed me her briefs
an hour ago.

605
00:21:45,297 --> 00:21:47,281
Um, yeah, I've, uh...
I got most of mine.

606
00:21:47,282 --> 00:21:49,333
Most? [Chuckles]

607
00:21:49,334 --> 00:21:51,168
If I can't count on you
for the effort,

608
00:21:51,169 --> 00:21:54,305
how the hell am I supposed
to count on you for the results?

609
00:21:54,306 --> 00:21:57,124
I'm sorry. It was my fault.

610
00:21:57,125 --> 00:21:59,677
Um, I'll get it done. Too late.

611
00:21:59,678 --> 00:22:01,178
Now I have to call
Daniel Hardman

612
00:22:01,179 --> 00:22:02,763
and postpone
and look like a fool.

613
00:22:02,764 --> 00:22:04,131
Thank you, Mr. Ross.

614
00:22:06,935 --> 00:22:09,303
- Mike...
- I don't want to hear it.

615
00:22:09,304 --> 00:22:11,272
Get it done.

616
00:22:19,725 --> 00:22:20,846
Rachael?

617
00:22:20,871 --> 00:22:21,808
Yes.

618
00:22:21,925 --> 00:22:23,876
Katrina Bennett.
We haven't met yet.

619
00:22:23,877 --> 00:22:25,744
Oh, I-I know who you are.
Welcome.

620
00:22:25,745 --> 00:22:28,413
Louis says you're
the best paralegal around.

621
00:22:28,414 --> 00:22:30,916
Thank you.

622
00:22:30,917 --> 00:22:32,417
I need 40 copies of these,

623
00:22:32,418 --> 00:22:33,886
and if you can duplicate
the tabs

624
00:22:33,887 --> 00:22:35,304
and have it back to me
within in an hour,

625
00:22:35,305 --> 00:22:38,223
I will be eternally
in your debt.

626
00:22:38,224 --> 00:22:41,060
Uh, Katrina, I'm so sorry.
I just can't.

627
00:22:41,061 --> 00:22:42,528
I'm too busy right now.

628
00:22:42,529 --> 00:22:44,262
Too busy on what?

629
00:22:44,263 --> 00:22:45,764
I'm going back
through discovery

630
00:22:45,765 --> 00:22:46,982
to see if I can find a door

631
00:22:46,983 --> 00:22:48,934
into Folsom's
personal correspondence.

632
00:22:48,935 --> 00:22:50,653
That's a wild-goose chase.
Who put you on that?

633
00:22:50,654 --> 00:22:51,770
Mike Ross.

634
00:22:51,771 --> 00:22:52,938
Well, I'm sorry you're busy

635
00:22:52,939 --> 00:22:54,239
working on something
for a first year.

636
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,242
But the managing partner
asked me to do something,

637
00:22:57,243 --> 00:22:59,111
and I didn't tell her
I was too busy.

638
00:22:59,112 --> 00:23:00,796
Right.

639
00:23:00,797 --> 00:23:02,948
This is for the same
managing partner.

640
00:23:02,949 --> 00:23:04,917
Yes, but she didn't ask for it.

641
00:23:04,918 --> 00:23:06,969
Mike Ross did.

642
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:09,505
Look, I know
you've taken your LSATs,

643
00:23:09,506 --> 00:23:11,390
and you may well be ready
to be a lawyer.

644
00:23:11,391 --> 00:23:13,425
But right now you're not.

645
00:23:13,426 --> 00:23:16,095
You're a paralegal.

646
00:23:16,096 --> 00:23:19,798
I'm doing my job,
and I need you to do yours.

647
00:23:31,444 --> 00:23:32,644
Rachel, do me a favor?

648
00:23:32,645 --> 00:23:33,912
Can you just put that on pause
for a sec?

649
00:23:33,913 --> 00:23:35,247
'Cause I need to make a copy.

650
00:23:35,248 --> 00:23:37,916
No, Louis, I can't.
I'm busy doing my job.

651
00:23:37,917 --> 00:23:39,317
Excuse me?

652
00:23:39,318 --> 00:23:41,286
What, do you want to fire me
like you fired Harold?

653
00:23:41,287 --> 00:23:43,655
Because honestly,
I-I-I don't give a shit.

654
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:48,927
I get it. [Chuckles]

655
00:23:48,928 --> 00:23:52,598
Rachel, listen, I know
about the Harvard thing.

656
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:54,600
And I think it's great. What?

657
00:23:54,601 --> 00:23:55,768
Yeah, Norma told me.

658
00:23:55,769 --> 00:23:57,553
Rachel, I know
the waiting is hard,

659
00:23:57,554 --> 00:24:00,222
but you're not going to be here
for much longer.

660
00:24:00,223 --> 00:24:04,026
I got 100% faith in you.

661
00:24:04,027 --> 00:24:05,944
[Voice breaking]
I didn't get in.

662
00:24:05,945 --> 00:24:07,146
What?

663
00:24:07,147 --> 00:24:08,397
I don't understand.
I had everything...

664
00:24:08,398 --> 00:24:10,682
my grades, the LSATs,
I'm a legacy,

665
00:24:10,683 --> 00:24:11,950
and I don't even
puff myself up,

666
00:24:11,951 --> 00:24:13,619
but I killed it
at that interview.

667
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:14,987
That doesn't make any sense.

668
00:24:14,988 --> 00:24:16,622
And do you remember that woman
who came from Harvard?

669
00:24:16,623 --> 00:24:18,523
She didn't like anyone,
but I swear, she loved me.

670
00:24:18,524 --> 00:24:20,409
Sheila?

671
00:24:20,410 --> 00:24:22,694
Yeah. Sheila... Sheila Sazs.

672
00:24:22,695 --> 00:24:24,713
You remember.

673
00:24:24,714 --> 00:24:26,531
Yeah, I remember.

674
00:24:26,532 --> 00:24:28,700
Is there something wrong?

675
00:24:28,701 --> 00:24:30,035
Yep, there is something wrong.

676
00:24:30,036 --> 00:24:33,005
I believe you were wronged.

677
00:24:33,006 --> 00:24:34,223
I believe you suffered

678
00:24:34,224 --> 00:24:36,175
the slings and arrows
of outrageous wrongness.

679
00:24:36,176 --> 00:24:37,709
And I will not have it.

680
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:39,144
What does that mean?

681
00:24:39,145 --> 00:24:41,230
That means that I'm going
to rectify this situation,

682
00:24:41,231 --> 00:24:44,233
because you, Miss Zane,
you're going to Harvard.

683
00:24:46,385 --> 00:24:48,053
[Telephone ringing]

684
00:24:48,054 --> 00:24:49,271
Looks like somebody
had a good trip.

685
00:24:49,272 --> 00:24:51,323
- Not exactly.
- Though the plane ride was fun.

686
00:24:51,324 --> 00:24:55,110
As long as you didn't hit
any turbulence.

687
00:24:55,111 --> 00:24:57,246
Jessica wants to see you.

688
00:24:57,247 --> 00:24:58,831
I'll be right back.

689
00:24:58,832 --> 00:25:00,616
Actually, she wants
to see both of you.

690
00:25:00,617 --> 00:25:02,234
Jessica wants to see me too?

691
00:25:02,235 --> 00:25:05,671
Not exactly.
Your boss wants to see you.

692
00:25:08,908 --> 00:25:10,676
I'll just ask the concierge
to find something...

693
00:25:10,677 --> 00:25:13,411
- Hello.
- Ah, Dana.

694
00:25:13,412 --> 00:25:16,248
And this must be
the man himself.

695
00:25:16,249 --> 00:25:17,766
Edward Darby.

696
00:25:17,767 --> 00:25:21,053
He doesn't seem stodgy at all,
or that old.

697
00:25:21,054 --> 00:25:23,222
You should see me
in my altogether.

698
00:25:23,223 --> 00:25:24,223
Pass.

699
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:25,524
Fair enough.

700
00:25:25,525 --> 00:25:27,309
[Jessica and Harvey chuckle]

701
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:29,862
Edward stopped in
to take stock of his investment.

702
00:25:29,863 --> 00:25:31,196
So how are we?

703
00:25:31,197 --> 00:25:32,481
We're right on schedule.

704
00:25:32,482 --> 00:25:34,199
Dana?

705
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,400
We've dropped a grenade.

706
00:25:35,401 --> 00:25:37,236
We're just waiting
for it to go off.

707
00:25:37,237 --> 00:25:39,738
- Meaning it hasn't.
- Rome wasn't built in a day.

708
00:25:39,739 --> 00:25:42,241
Excellent point.
I needn't have crossed the pond.

709
00:25:42,242 --> 00:25:44,776
And yet, here you are.

710
00:25:44,777 --> 00:25:45,911
[Sighs]

711
00:25:45,912 --> 00:25:48,613
Well, as I confessed
to Jessica,

712
00:25:48,614 --> 00:25:52,217
I have an ulterior motive
in our little venture.

713
00:25:52,218 --> 00:25:54,086
Daniel Hardman.

714
00:25:54,087 --> 00:25:57,956
I've had
the distinct displeasure.

715
00:25:57,957 --> 00:26:01,126
So I have asked him
to step it up a notch.

716
00:26:03,313 --> 00:26:06,265
Nice. Attack him on all fronts.

717
00:26:06,266 --> 00:26:08,066
We have clients everywhere.

718
00:26:08,067 --> 00:26:09,801
Finding a bone
of contention with him

719
00:26:09,802 --> 00:26:12,237
seemed the least
I could contribute.

720
00:26:12,238 --> 00:26:14,022
Along with 12 million pounds.

721
00:26:14,023 --> 00:26:17,075
I hate talking numbers.
I prefer raking them in.

722
00:26:17,076 --> 00:26:20,112
Well, I've done
what I came to do.

723
00:26:20,113 --> 00:26:22,247
Now I'm going to get
out of your way.

724
00:26:22,248 --> 00:26:24,416
Nice to put a face to all this.

725
00:26:24,417 --> 00:26:26,919
And a lovely face,
it turns out.

726
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,320
Thank you, Edward.

727
00:26:28,321 --> 00:26:29,872
I was referring to your man.

728
00:26:29,873 --> 00:26:31,373
[Both chuckle]

729
00:26:31,374 --> 00:26:34,293
I'll be waiting
for that detonation.

730
00:26:34,294 --> 00:26:36,595
I trust it will come through.
Mmhmm.

731
00:26:41,517 --> 00:26:43,268
[Knocks on glass]
You wanted to see me?

732
00:26:43,269 --> 00:26:45,721
Yeah.

733
00:26:45,722 --> 00:26:47,773
I wanted to explain
about earlier.

734
00:26:47,774 --> 00:26:49,858
You don't have to. It's fine.
I overreacted.

735
00:26:49,859 --> 00:26:51,310
Okay, then I won't.

736
00:26:51,311 --> 00:26:53,645
I will just tell you
I found what you needed.

737
00:26:53,646 --> 00:26:55,697
What, like you went
through the rest of the files?

738
00:26:55,698 --> 00:26:57,783
No. I found what you needed.

739
00:26:57,784 --> 00:26:59,318
- Access?
- Hanley Folsom.

740
00:26:59,319 --> 00:27:00,786
- Personal?
- Bingo.

741
00:27:00,787 --> 00:27:02,487
Oh, my God, that couldn't
have come at a better time.

742
00:27:02,488 --> 00:27:03,855
I would have found them
for you sooner,

743
00:27:03,856 --> 00:27:05,290
but I had to copy
some bullshit for Katrina.

744
00:27:05,291 --> 00:27:07,709
Why didn't you just tell her
you were working for me?

745
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:09,294
I told her exactly
what I was doing for you.

746
00:27:09,295 --> 00:27:11,246
And she didn't... oh, God.

747
00:27:11,247 --> 00:27:13,248
Never mind. I get it.
She did the same thing to me.

748
00:27:13,249 --> 00:27:14,666
She pulls that fifth-year crap,

749
00:27:14,667 --> 00:27:16,084
and then you don't feel
like dealing.

750
00:27:16,085 --> 00:27:17,336
You have no idea.

751
00:27:17,337 --> 00:27:19,537
What do we have?

752
00:27:19,538 --> 00:27:22,040
Enough for you
to write a motion.

753
00:27:22,041 --> 00:27:24,426
- He seems nice.
- He was pissed.

754
00:27:24,427 --> 00:27:26,929
That was pissed?
What does happy look like?

755
00:27:26,930 --> 00:27:28,347
He's British...
pretty much the same thing.

756
00:27:28,348 --> 00:27:29,881
Then how'd you know
he was pissed?

757
00:27:29,882 --> 00:27:31,516
- Wouldn't you be?
- I am.

758
00:27:31,517 --> 00:27:33,551
We haven't turned
Cathleen Mitchell yet.

759
00:27:33,552 --> 00:27:34,886
Your good cop failed.

760
00:27:34,887 --> 00:27:37,222
No, your move failed.

761
00:27:37,223 --> 00:27:38,890
Well, Jessica took it well.

762
00:27:38,891 --> 00:27:41,159
Because she had company.
I'll hear about it later.

763
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,694
Does he do that...

764
00:27:42,695 --> 00:27:44,729
just pop in for a spot of tea?

765
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:46,698
It's 12 million pounds.

766
00:27:46,699 --> 00:27:49,234
You weren't expecting him.

767
00:27:49,235 --> 00:27:51,236
No...

768
00:27:51,237 --> 00:27:53,755
I wasn't.

769
00:27:53,756 --> 00:27:56,008
But this is a big investment
for him, Harvey.

770
00:27:56,009 --> 00:27:57,742
His investment is only money.

771
00:27:57,743 --> 00:28:00,963
For me, it's my whole firm.

772
00:28:00,964 --> 00:28:04,716
Excuse me.
Harvey, do you have a minute?

773
00:28:04,717 --> 00:28:07,419
[Keys clacking]

774
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:10,605
You got here just in time.
I'm getting us access.

775
00:28:10,606 --> 00:28:12,691
- Hanley Folsom?
- Bingo.

776
00:28:12,692 --> 00:28:14,759
Well, if you're talking
about the July 29th reference

777
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,594
in his business email
to his personal email,

778
00:28:16,595 --> 00:28:18,263
then you're too late. What?

779
00:28:18,264 --> 00:28:20,315
Katrina gave me the subpoena
an hour ago.

780
00:28:20,316 --> 00:28:22,617
I guess it's a good thing
Jessica put her

781
00:28:22,618 --> 00:28:24,269
on the case after all.

782
00:28:36,624 --> 00:28:40,005
When people steal from me,
I take it personally.

783
00:28:40,007 --> 00:28:42,225
- Are you subpoenaing me?
- You diverted Rachel.

784
00:28:42,226 --> 00:28:44,094
And then you pursued
my idea yourself.

785
00:28:44,095 --> 00:28:45,729
Your idea?

786
00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:47,297
Are you denying it?

787
00:28:47,298 --> 00:28:49,566
No, you said we needed to fly,
so I built an airplane.

788
00:28:49,567 --> 00:28:51,334
And then flew it
right into Harvey's office

789
00:28:51,335 --> 00:28:52,769
just in time to take credit.

790
00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:54,521
I offered you a chance
to work together.

791
00:28:54,522 --> 00:28:55,772
You didn't want to take it.

792
00:28:55,773 --> 00:28:56,990
You've always got an answer.

793
00:28:56,991 --> 00:28:59,109
And you've always got
an accusation.

794
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:00,360
So either run to Harvey

795
00:29:00,361 --> 00:29:02,195
and tell him
your little tale of woe,

796
00:29:02,196 --> 00:29:04,647
or get to work
prepping for Folsom, like I am.

797
00:29:06,918 --> 00:29:09,920
[Elevator bell dings]

798
00:29:11,873 --> 00:29:15,491
[Knock at door]

799
00:29:15,492 --> 00:29:16,859
Louis.

800
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:18,661
Sheila.

801
00:29:18,662 --> 00:29:21,563
- Where's my interviewee?
- I dispatched him.

802
00:29:21,564 --> 00:29:22,615
That's unacceptable.

803
00:29:22,616 --> 00:29:27,169
- You are unacceptable.
- Excuse me?

804
00:29:27,170 --> 00:29:28,871
You behaved unprofessionally.

805
00:29:28,872 --> 00:29:30,589
I never behave
unprofessionally.

806
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:32,458
Okay, fine.

807
00:29:32,459 --> 00:29:33,592
Ski mask and coconut oil?

808
00:29:33,593 --> 00:29:34,910
That was personal.

809
00:29:34,911 --> 00:29:37,346
But you let the personal
color the professional,

810
00:29:37,347 --> 00:29:39,048
and Rachel Zane
will not be a casualty

811
00:29:39,049 --> 00:29:40,249
of your misplaced anger.

812
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:43,085
"Misplaced"?
You made me look the fool.

813
00:29:43,086 --> 00:29:44,470
I looked the fool.

814
00:29:44,471 --> 00:29:46,689
You were collateral damage...
not my fault.

815
00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:48,424
And it certainly
wasn't Ms. Zane's fault.

816
00:29:48,425 --> 00:29:51,260
So you're here to be
her knight in shining armor.

817
00:29:51,261 --> 00:29:52,928
I'm here to right a wrong.

818
00:29:52,929 --> 00:29:56,031
- How very...
- Very what?

819
00:29:56,032 --> 00:29:57,199
Noble.

820
00:30:01,604 --> 00:30:05,374
Yeah, it is.

821
00:30:05,375 --> 00:30:09,545
And you're going to undo this.

822
00:30:09,546 --> 00:30:11,630
I am.

823
00:30:11,631 --> 00:30:14,283
That's not what I meant.

824
00:30:14,284 --> 00:30:17,420
But it's what you've caused.

825
00:30:17,421 --> 00:30:19,638
I...

826
00:30:19,639 --> 00:30:20,956
Will not be denied.

827
00:30:20,957 --> 00:30:22,475
Then come reap
what you've sowed.

828
00:30:22,476 --> 00:30:24,977
- Have at you.
- Joust me.

829
00:30:28,148 --> 00:30:29,515
I don't care what it takes.

830
00:30:29,516 --> 00:30:31,767
We need to get to that
smoking gun before Katrina does.

831
00:30:31,768 --> 00:30:35,855
She already found it.

832
00:30:35,856 --> 00:30:37,773
Katrina gave it
to Missy Dietler to make copies.

833
00:30:37,774 --> 00:30:41,977
I'm sure it's already
in Jessica's hands by now.

834
00:30:41,978 --> 00:30:44,914
Wait a minute. Missy Dietler?

835
00:30:44,915 --> 00:30:47,450
She's going to take four coffee
breaks before she's done.

836
00:30:47,451 --> 00:30:48,617
She's going to take
four coffee breaks

837
00:30:48,618 --> 00:30:49,752
before she finishes
her coffee break.

838
00:30:49,753 --> 00:30:51,170
Which means it's probably still

839
00:30:51,171 --> 00:30:52,821
in the copy machine right now.

840
00:30:52,822 --> 00:30:54,123
Missy's not going to leave
the documents

841
00:30:54,124 --> 00:30:55,374
just sitting
in the copy machine.

842
00:30:55,375 --> 00:30:58,093
No, but she probably
already scanned them.

843
00:30:58,094 --> 00:31:00,095
So all we need is her code.

844
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:03,665
You're talking about
stealing someone's work.

845
00:31:03,666 --> 00:31:07,836
Mm, someone who lied to you,
stole from me,

846
00:31:07,837 --> 00:31:09,855
and made us both
look like fools.

847
00:31:09,856 --> 00:31:11,474
Look, if you have any qualms,
think about it.

848
00:31:11,475 --> 00:31:12,775
We're all on the same team.

849
00:31:12,776 --> 00:31:14,477
The faster this gets done,
the better for everyone.

850
00:31:14,478 --> 00:31:16,145
Oh, you got an answer
for everything.

851
00:31:16,146 --> 00:31:18,147
Well, so does she.

852
00:31:18,148 --> 00:31:19,982
Are you sure
you want to do this?

853
00:31:19,983 --> 00:31:22,735
Yes.

854
00:31:22,736 --> 00:31:25,371
Uh, whoa. What are you doing?

855
00:31:25,372 --> 00:31:27,323
Manningham's had a crush
on me since the day I got here.

856
00:31:27,324 --> 00:31:29,542
He would give me his mother's
social security number

857
00:31:29,543 --> 00:31:30,859
if I asked him for it.

858
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:32,328
Okay, Rachel, we don't
have much time.

859
00:31:32,329 --> 00:31:33,496
I need a sure thing here.

860
00:31:33,497 --> 00:31:36,865
Mike...

861
00:31:36,866 --> 00:31:39,635
I am a sure thing.

862
00:31:45,509 --> 00:31:47,009
Yeah, I mean, give it a shot.

863
00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:49,345
It probably won't work,
but, um...

864
00:31:52,232 --> 00:31:55,884
That was brutal,
deliciously brutal.

865
00:31:55,885 --> 00:31:59,855
And your act of vengeance
raised my ire.

866
00:31:59,856 --> 00:32:03,826
You, sir, are a knight.

867
00:32:03,827 --> 00:32:07,563
And now it is time
to right what is wrong.

868
00:32:07,564 --> 00:32:10,232
Look, Sheila, I'm flattered
by what you did,

869
00:32:10,233 --> 00:32:12,618
but this is not fair,

870
00:32:12,619 --> 00:32:15,621
and you know it can't stand.

871
00:32:15,622 --> 00:32:18,924
Louis, pull a resume
from the stack... any one.

872
00:32:18,925 --> 00:32:20,960
Read it. [Sighs]

873
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:25,722
Sure.

874
00:32:27,634 --> 00:32:30,302
Magna cum laude, Yale, 3.9 GPA.

875
00:32:30,303 --> 00:32:32,304
Another one.

876
00:32:34,558 --> 00:32:37,526
Summa cum laude,
Georgetown, 4.3. GPA.

877
00:32:37,527 --> 00:32:39,478
Listen, I get it.
I know what you're trying...

878
00:32:39,479 --> 00:32:42,648
That's my reject pile.

879
00:32:45,986 --> 00:32:47,369
I am a professional.

880
00:32:47,370 --> 00:32:48,821
I would never let
my feelings for you

881
00:32:48,822 --> 00:32:50,322
sway me against a candidate.

882
00:32:50,323 --> 00:32:52,124
Okay, but you have to let them

883
00:32:52,125 --> 00:32:54,276
sway you for a candidate.

884
00:32:54,277 --> 00:32:56,879
You can't ask me that.

885
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,998
Rachel Zane
is the best paralegal

886
00:32:58,999 --> 00:33:00,833
in the best law firm
in New York.

887
00:33:00,834 --> 00:33:03,669
She is relied upon
by the best lawyers

888
00:33:03,670 --> 00:33:05,971
who have graduated
from the best university.

889
00:33:05,972 --> 00:33:07,339
The woman is crimson.

890
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:08,974
So who do I knock out?

891
00:33:11,845 --> 00:33:13,062
I promised her.

892
00:33:13,063 --> 00:33:17,516
Louis, I liked her. I did.

893
00:33:17,517 --> 00:33:21,403
You're just going to have
to tell her the truth.

894
00:33:21,404 --> 00:33:24,473
Sometimes
good isn't good enough.

895
00:33:27,661 --> 00:33:30,412
So how's
that detonation coming?

896
00:33:30,413 --> 00:33:31,830
Long fuse.

897
00:33:31,831 --> 00:33:33,832
Is that your way of telling me
that it's never going off?

898
00:33:33,833 --> 00:33:35,167
Well, if it doesn't,

899
00:33:35,168 --> 00:33:36,919
you could always have James Bond
take care of it for you.

900
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,320
That reminds me.

901
00:33:38,321 --> 00:33:40,205
How are things going
with Pussy Galore?

902
00:33:40,206 --> 00:33:42,041
Um, I believe, at this point,

903
00:33:42,042 --> 00:33:46,161
she's still flying missions
for Goldfinger.

904
00:33:46,162 --> 00:33:48,714
"No, Mr. Bond,
I expect you to die."

905
00:33:48,715 --> 00:33:50,499
What the hell
are you doing here?

906
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:52,501
We can win Parkville.

907
00:33:54,504 --> 00:33:56,672
This is the key to everything.

908
00:33:56,673 --> 00:34:00,175
Well, then we need to get
Pussy Galore back on that plane.

909
00:34:09,432 --> 00:34:12,967
[Elevator bell dings,
telephone rings]

910
00:34:12,968 --> 00:34:14,736
Just remember what I told you.

911
00:34:14,737 --> 00:34:16,971
No matter what happens...

912
00:34:16,972 --> 00:34:20,108
well, if it isn't
the three stooges.

913
00:34:20,109 --> 00:34:21,827
Oh, dibs on Curly.

914
00:34:21,828 --> 00:34:23,745
Would you gentlemen mind
accompanying us

915
00:34:23,746 --> 00:34:25,497
to the conference room?

916
00:34:25,498 --> 00:34:27,783
What is she doing here?

917
00:34:27,784 --> 00:34:28,983
Dana Scott?

918
00:34:28,984 --> 00:34:31,152
She's the attorney of record
on the case.

919
00:34:31,153 --> 00:34:32,987
He's referring to my employee.

920
00:34:32,988 --> 00:34:35,674
Oh, well, at the moment,
she's reading this.

921
00:34:35,675 --> 00:34:37,426
An email you wrote
from your personal account

922
00:34:37,427 --> 00:34:39,127
on the subject
of hiring Ms. Mitchell.

923
00:34:39,128 --> 00:34:41,996
And next,
we'll show her the attachment.

924
00:34:41,997 --> 00:34:43,348
It wasn't on your copy.

925
00:34:43,349 --> 00:34:45,500
Oddly enough,
it wasn't on ours either.

926
00:34:45,501 --> 00:34:47,335
Mike managed
to find the original.

927
00:34:47,336 --> 00:34:49,020
We'll need time to review this.

928
00:34:49,021 --> 00:34:50,389
Review it? He wrote it.

929
00:34:50,390 --> 00:34:52,190
You knew
she couldn't have children.

930
00:34:52,191 --> 00:34:53,692
That's why you
changed her review,

931
00:34:53,693 --> 00:34:55,143
and that's why you
promoted her.

932
00:34:55,144 --> 00:34:57,312
And when she sees it,
she'll join the suit,

933
00:34:57,313 --> 00:35:01,683
and you won't stand a chance.

934
00:35:01,684 --> 00:35:03,952
That email
doesn't prove a pattern.

935
00:35:03,953 --> 00:35:06,405
- It proves what he did to her.
- It's one case.

936
00:35:06,406 --> 00:35:07,873
We'll see you at the next 44.

937
00:35:07,874 --> 00:35:09,157
In the meantime,

938
00:35:09,158 --> 00:35:10,742
we won't be participating
in that deposition

939
00:35:10,743 --> 00:35:13,027
until you put Ms. Mitchell
back on a plane.

940
00:35:22,722 --> 00:35:25,724
[Elevator bell dings]

941
00:35:29,929 --> 00:35:30,946
How'd it go?

942
00:35:30,947 --> 00:35:32,230
It's not over yet.

943
00:35:32,231 --> 00:35:33,899
But you're out of the doghouse
with Jessica?

944
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:36,318
Out.

945
00:35:36,319 --> 00:35:37,519
What?

946
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:40,021
You never said how it went
with Manningham.

947
00:35:40,022 --> 00:35:44,409
[Laughs] And I never will.

948
00:35:44,410 --> 00:35:46,862
Well, if it isn't
Bonnie and Clyde.

949
00:35:46,863 --> 00:35:48,363
What are you doing
in my office?

950
00:35:48,364 --> 00:35:51,032
Well, I didn't think you cared
to respect what's yours

951
00:35:51,033 --> 00:35:54,119
or, more to the point,
what's mine.

952
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:56,371
Your problem's not with her.
It's with me.

953
00:35:56,372 --> 00:35:57,756
Okay.

954
00:35:57,757 --> 00:35:59,791
You stole my discovery,
and you know it.

955
00:35:59,792 --> 00:36:01,209
Oh, you mean
that piece of paper

956
00:36:01,210 --> 00:36:02,594
that I turned into a strategy?

957
00:36:02,595 --> 00:36:04,746
Or, as you like to call it,
an airplane.

958
00:36:04,747 --> 00:36:06,715
Okay, fine.

959
00:36:06,716 --> 00:36:09,017
I put my toe over the line.

960
00:36:09,018 --> 00:36:10,418
You obliterated it.

961
00:36:10,419 --> 00:36:11,636
Yeah. I'm so sorry.

962
00:36:11,637 --> 00:36:14,055
But yesterday you were
the fifth-year authority

963
00:36:14,056 --> 00:36:16,224
on right and wrong, so I...

964
00:36:16,225 --> 00:36:17,726
I was just taking your advice.

965
00:36:17,727 --> 00:36:19,644
And which side
of right and wrong

966
00:36:19,645 --> 00:36:21,480
does sleeping
with the paralegals fall on?

967
00:36:21,481 --> 00:36:23,264
Get the hell out of my office.

968
00:36:23,265 --> 00:36:25,433
You're right.

969
00:36:25,434 --> 00:36:28,069
That's none of my business.

970
00:36:28,070 --> 00:36:30,155
But it's a good thing
you're going to law school,

971
00:36:30,156 --> 00:36:32,407
because they may sleep
with the paralegals,

972
00:36:32,408 --> 00:36:34,626
but they end up
with the lawyers.

973
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:39,080
Of course, when you called,

974
00:36:39,081 --> 00:36:40,832
I popped straight over,
but I must say,

975
00:36:40,833 --> 00:36:43,952
you do keep uncivilized hours
in the little apple.

976
00:36:43,953 --> 00:36:46,120
It's the Big Apple.

977
00:36:46,121 --> 00:36:49,057
Well, then someone's just
sold me a counterfeit T-shirt.

978
00:36:49,058 --> 00:36:51,476
A sense of humor...
I love that in a man,

979
00:36:51,477 --> 00:36:53,895
which is why
I'm prepared to consider

980
00:36:53,896 --> 00:36:55,313
taking you up on your offer.

981
00:36:55,314 --> 00:36:58,132
Might I inquire
what changed your mind?

982
00:37:01,103 --> 00:37:02,320
What's this?

983
00:37:02,321 --> 00:37:04,773
Our books
from the last five years.

984
00:37:04,774 --> 00:37:06,474
If we're going to do this,
I want you to know

985
00:37:06,475 --> 00:37:08,910
exactly what it is
you're getting yourself into.

986
00:37:08,911 --> 00:37:10,495
Now, start at the beginning.

987
00:37:10,496 --> 00:37:12,614
It's a great read.

988
00:37:12,615 --> 00:37:14,699
You are an impressive woman.

989
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:17,452
Oh, you don't know the half.

990
00:37:17,453 --> 00:37:21,489
Well, here's
to my further education.

991
00:37:37,339 --> 00:37:38,940
You're late.

992
00:37:38,941 --> 00:37:42,727
That's not going to get you
out of buying me a drink first.

993
00:37:42,728 --> 00:37:44,012
No more bullshit.

994
00:37:44,013 --> 00:37:45,530
What?

995
00:37:45,531 --> 00:37:47,399
I just left Jessica
and your boss,

996
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:49,200
and I know what I saw.

997
00:37:49,201 --> 00:37:51,686
They're in bed together,
and I don't mean having sex.

998
00:37:51,687 --> 00:37:53,021
They're talking merger.

999
00:37:53,022 --> 00:37:54,456
It's not what it looks like.

1000
00:37:54,457 --> 00:37:56,541
Hardman can check a plane,
and I can check a plane.

1001
00:37:56,542 --> 00:37:58,376
Edward Darby flew here
the day you did.

1002
00:37:58,377 --> 00:38:00,045
He didn't just pop in.

1003
00:38:00,046 --> 00:38:01,379
He wasn't supposed to do that.

1004
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:02,664
You don't want your name
on the door.

1005
00:38:02,665 --> 00:38:03,915
You want your name on my door.

1006
00:38:03,916 --> 00:38:06,701
I want to see our names
on the same door.

1007
00:38:06,702 --> 00:38:08,036
Yeah, like I said,

1008
00:38:08,037 --> 00:38:09,838
it's never the full story
with you.

1009
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:10,972
I wanted to be able
to tell you myself.

1010
00:38:10,973 --> 00:38:12,257
Then why didn't you tell me?

1011
00:38:12,258 --> 00:38:14,142
Because he wouldn't let me
until he decided.

1012
00:38:14,143 --> 00:38:16,210
Well, evidently,
he decided without you.

1013
00:38:16,211 --> 00:38:17,545
Okay, okay. He jumped the gun.

1014
00:38:17,546 --> 00:38:19,264
But I have his promise, Harvey.

1015
00:38:19,265 --> 00:38:21,066
If we merge,
he names me as partner,

1016
00:38:21,067 --> 00:38:24,152
and Jessica's only choice
is you.

1017
00:38:24,153 --> 00:38:26,154
I don't need you
to get my name on the door

1018
00:38:26,155 --> 00:38:28,356
any more than I need you
to win this case.

1019
00:38:28,357 --> 00:38:29,891
You know what, Harvey?

1020
00:38:29,892 --> 00:38:32,226
You have been outgunned
ever since Hardman left.

1021
00:38:32,227 --> 00:38:33,612
I am bringing the guns.

1022
00:38:33,613 --> 00:38:35,363
This is exactly
what you've always wanted.

1023
00:38:35,364 --> 00:38:36,448
Get over your pride.

1024
00:38:36,449 --> 00:38:39,000
I'm not getting over anything.

1025
00:38:39,001 --> 00:38:41,736
And this merger
isn't happening.

1026
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:57,018
Jessica. Edward.

1027
00:38:57,019 --> 00:38:59,921
Daniel, haven't seen you
since that business in Milan.

1028
00:38:59,922 --> 00:39:01,640
- Beautiful weather.
- Oh, enough.

1029
00:39:01,641 --> 00:39:03,441
We are not
friendly adversaries, Daniel.

1030
00:39:03,442 --> 00:39:04,859
And you're about to lose.

1031
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:06,427
My client already said no.

1032
00:39:06,428 --> 00:39:08,446
He may no longer listen to you

1033
00:39:08,447 --> 00:39:10,598
when I inform him
of your prior embezzlement.

1034
00:39:10,599 --> 00:39:12,901
You told him.

1035
00:39:12,902 --> 00:39:14,936
I didn't tell him anything.

1036
00:39:14,937 --> 00:39:16,821
I found it on my own.

1037
00:39:16,822 --> 00:39:19,407
Edward and I are merging.
I had to show him the books.

1038
00:39:19,408 --> 00:39:22,243
Legally required
to show me her books.

1039
00:39:22,244 --> 00:39:24,946
And unlike you,
I don't break the law.

1040
00:39:24,947 --> 00:39:28,833
A fact that Hanley Folsom
could be made acutely aware of.

1041
00:39:28,834 --> 00:39:31,553
You do break the law, Jessica.

1042
00:39:31,554 --> 00:39:33,555
Not reporting embezzlement
is a crime.

1043
00:39:33,556 --> 00:39:36,841
Why don't you bring that up
at your sentencing hearing?

1044
00:39:36,842 --> 00:39:38,510
Why don't I sue you?

1045
00:39:38,511 --> 00:39:41,796
You could.

1046
00:39:41,797 --> 00:39:43,732
Anybody could sue anybody.

1047
00:39:43,733 --> 00:39:45,600
But you still don't have proof
that I told him.

1048
00:39:45,601 --> 00:39:47,769
And our firms combined
have ten times

1049
00:39:47,770 --> 00:39:50,155
the resources that yours d...

1050
00:39:50,156 --> 00:39:52,991
[chuckles] Oh, wait.
You don't have a firm.

1051
00:39:52,992 --> 00:39:56,277
You're just here,
living in Zane's offices,

1052
00:39:56,278 --> 00:39:58,813
working on those cases
that will no longer be yours

1053
00:39:58,814 --> 00:40:02,150
when we're done with you.

1054
00:40:02,151 --> 00:40:05,120
Good-bye, Daniel.

1055
00:40:06,922 --> 00:40:09,323
Oh...

1056
00:40:09,324 --> 00:40:13,511
Get your client
to sign those papers, will you?

1057
00:40:31,313 --> 00:40:33,531
[Knocks on glass]

1058
00:40:37,953 --> 00:40:40,021
What is it, Louis?

1059
00:40:40,022 --> 00:40:43,208
Got a hard truth to tell you.

1060
00:40:45,411 --> 00:40:49,363
- I'm not going to Harvard.
- No, you're not.

1061
00:40:49,364 --> 00:40:50,531
I get it.

1062
00:40:50,532 --> 00:40:53,001
I'm not good enough.
I never have been.

1063
00:40:53,002 --> 00:40:54,636
That is not the hard truth.

1064
00:40:54,637 --> 00:40:56,137
You are an amazing candidate,

1065
00:40:56,138 --> 00:40:58,173
and you need to know this
in your heart.

1066
00:40:58,174 --> 00:41:02,510
The truth is,
you did not get in...

1067
00:41:02,511 --> 00:41:04,062
Because I let you down.

1068
00:41:08,734 --> 00:41:10,885
What are you talking about?

1069
00:41:10,886 --> 00:41:13,688
Sheila and I
had a relationship.

1070
00:41:13,689 --> 00:41:17,108
I hurt her, and...

1071
00:41:17,109 --> 00:41:19,694
And she took it out on me?

1072
00:41:19,695 --> 00:41:21,696
I'm going to write you
a recommendation for anywhere,

1073
00:41:21,697 --> 00:41:23,748
any law school.

1074
00:41:23,749 --> 00:41:25,033
It just...

1075
00:41:25,034 --> 00:41:27,085
Won't be Harvard.

1076
00:41:42,434 --> 00:41:45,436
I'm really sorry.
