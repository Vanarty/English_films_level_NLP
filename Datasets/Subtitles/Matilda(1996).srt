a real wart. A what?

A carbuncle, a blister, a festering

Oh, no, Matilda Wormwood is a
very sweet girl, and very bright.

A bright child?

498
00:31:52,953 --> 00:31:55,251
Yes. She can multiply
large sums in her head.

499
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:58,003
So can a calculator.

in an older and more advanced class.

Yes!

Listen to me, Jen.

507
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:21,983
The distance the shot put goes depends
upon the effort you put into it.
