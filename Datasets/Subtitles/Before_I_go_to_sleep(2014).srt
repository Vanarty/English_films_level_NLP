1
00:02:50,375 --> 00:02:51,957
Who are you?

2
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:55,457
l'm your husband. Ben.

3
00:02:56,541 --> 00:02:57,957
What?

4
00:02:58,583 --> 00:03:00,415
We got married in 1999.

5
00:03:01,708 --> 00:03:03,124
That's 14 years ago.

6
00:03:03,375 --> 00:03:04,790
Uh...

7
00:03:05,083 --> 00:03:07,082
Christine, you're 40.

8
00:03:23,791 --> 00:03:25,624
You had an accident.

9
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:29,624
lt was a bad accident.
You had head injuries.

10
00:03:30,958 --> 00:03:32,665
And you have problems
remembering things.

11
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:35,790
What things? What...

12
00:03:36,541 --> 00:03:39,665
Everything. You store up
information for a day

13
00:03:40,083 --> 00:03:41,999
and when you wake up
in the morning, it's all gone,

14
00:03:42,083 --> 00:03:43,874
you're back to your early 20s.

15
00:03:51,916 --> 00:03:53,499
lt'll be okay.

16
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:56,457
Just... trust me.

17
00:03:56,541 --> 00:03:58,082
- l'm scared.
- l know.

18
00:03:58,166 --> 00:03:59,665
l know, it's all right.

19
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:02,290
l love you.

20
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:11,874
l love you, Christine.

21
00:04:15,583 --> 00:04:17,665
We've been married for 14 years.

22
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:21,165
We met during your last term at King's.

23
00:04:21,708 --> 00:04:23,124
You were doing an MA in History

24
00:04:23,208 --> 00:04:25,165
and we got married
a couple of years after that.

25
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:26,999
l'd have been perfectly happy
with the registry office...

26
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:30,457
...but you wanted a white wedding.

27
00:04:30,541 --> 00:04:32,790
l hated every moment of it

28
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:35,457
until l saw you walking down the aisle.

29
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:37,165
ls every day like this?

30
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:40,874
ls every day the same?

31
00:04:42,958 --> 00:04:45,790
That's just a list of everything
you might need.

32
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:47,707
And where you'll find it.

33
00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:50,290
Aspirin, first aid,
sanitary towels, toiletries.

34
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:52,207
Couple of things you're allergic to.

35
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,957
And, uh...

36
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:57,207
Well, it's a list of things to do.
You like to keep busy.

37
00:04:57,625 --> 00:04:59,249
"Pack bag."

38
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:00,999
Today's our anniversary.

39
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:03,124
l'm taking you away.

40
00:05:03,208 --> 00:05:05,624
- Tonight. After work.
- Where?

41
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:09,082
That's a surprise.

42
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:10,874
A nice one.

43
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:13,874
You'll understand when we get there,
l promise.

44
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:19,957
l love you, Christine.

45
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:26,999
Christine?

46
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:28,499
Yes?

47
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:30,499
lt's Dr Nasch.

48
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:33,624
That'll mean nothing to you,
l know, but don't worry.

49
00:06:34,041 --> 00:06:37,040
We've been doing some work
on your memory. All right?

50
00:06:37,958 --> 00:06:40,790
Trying to figure out precisely
what's caused your problem

51
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:43,165
and whether there's
anything we can do to fix it.

52
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:45,499
Ben didn't say anything about this.

53
00:06:46,708 --> 00:06:48,707
l'm not certain that Ben knows.

54
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:51,832
l don't understand.

55
00:06:53,041 --> 00:06:55,957
Christine, l want you to do
something for me.

56
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:59,832
l want you to
open the wardrobe in your bedroom.

57
00:07:00,916 --> 00:07:03,499
Your wardrobe in the bedroom.

58
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:12,832
We're looking for something.

59
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:17,332
Hidden at the bottom of the wardrobe,
at the back, in a drawer.

60
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:21,832
- What am l looking for?
- We're looking for a shoe box.

61
00:07:22,416 --> 00:07:24,540
- Can you see it?
- No.

62
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,415
The right-hand wardrobe
nearest the bathroom.

63
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:41,957
Have you found the camera, Christine?

64
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:45,249
Yes.

65
00:07:45,416 --> 00:07:49,999
On the top, right-hand side
of the camera is a power button.

66
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:52,499
l want you to switch the camera on.

67
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:55,415
Now l want you to hit the "play" button
on the back of the camera.

68
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:01,457
My name is Christine,
Christine Lucas.

69
00:08:01,541 --> 00:08:03,957
l'm 40 years old and l'm an amnesiac.

70
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:07,707
Tonight, as l sleep, my mind

71
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:09,040
will erase everything,

72
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:10,832
everything that l know today.

73
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:13,332
Everything that l did today.

74
00:08:13,916 --> 00:08:16,999
And l will wake up tomorrow,
like l did this morning,

75
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:20,374
thinking that l have
my whole life ahead of me.

76
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:21,915
And the truth is...

77
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,874
The truth is half my life is over.

78
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,624
Oh, shit. He's coming.

79
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:42,082
Admittedly,

80
00:08:42,166 --> 00:08:45,124
this isn't a run-of-the-mill
doctor-patient relationship.

81
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:49,332
Picking you up at home,
driving you to my office.

82
00:08:49,416 --> 00:08:52,207
Seeing you without
your husband's knowledge.

83
00:08:57,166 --> 00:08:58,624
Are you all right?

84
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:27,040
l saw you in the park six months ago,
quite by chance.

85
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:28,665
You'd been referred to me
by a colleague

86
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:31,707
but l'd had absolutely no luck
getting hold of you. ln fact,

87
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:35,082
l recognised you from
your photograph in the file.

88
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:38,749
l explained that
l was a neuropsychologist

89
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:43,624
and that l was preparing a paper
on atypical psychogenic amnesia,

90
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:48,207
and that l was prepared to treat you
on a pro bono basis.

91
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:51,540
You agreed to give me
the telephone numbers

92
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:53,165
you had written in your diary.

93
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:00,832
l called you a few days later.

94
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,290
You didn't remember meeting me,
of course,

95
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:06,082
but you did consent to see me again.

96
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:08,290
Later that day you told me

97
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:11,040
you'd mentioned the possibility
of further treatment to Ben,

98
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:13,999
who made it very clear to you

99
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:16,207
you'd received extensive attention
in the past

100
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:20,207
and it had done nothing
other than to upset you.

101
00:10:20,291 --> 00:10:21,707
After you.

102
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:28,957
l want you to keep a visual diary.

103
00:10:30,791 --> 00:10:32,031
l've set the time and the date,

104
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:34,499
l've put in the biggest
memory chip l can find.

105
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:38,249
lt'll allow you to hold on
to the previous day's memories.

106
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:40,707
And even if the periods
before and after the attack

107
00:10:40,791 --> 00:10:43,665
remain blank, at least this will
bring some continuity...

108
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:45,165
Attack?

109
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:47,915
What attack?

110
00:10:48,666 --> 00:10:50,082
Ten years ago...

111
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:53,207
you were found on an industrial estate

112
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,582
not far from here.

113
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:58,665
According to the medical report,

114
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:02,957
your injuries were commensurate
with repeated blows to the head.

115
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:09,957
No. No, my husband said
that l had an accident.

116
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:11,624
l'm sure of it.

117
00:11:11,708 --> 00:11:13,665
l have a copy of
the medical report here.

118
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,999
Some newspaper articles. Mostly tabloid.

119
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:24,749
There's very little information
about the actual attack.

120
00:11:24,833 --> 00:11:26,874
"Left for dead"?

121
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:29,832
Someone tried to kill me?

122
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:33,957
Who? Who tried to kill me?

123
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:36,665
No one knows.

124
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:39,165
- What?
- No one but you.

125
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:50,374
l don't think Ben should know
about the camera.

126
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:52,957
lt's your diary.

127
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:55,999
l think it's important you don't feel...

128
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:58,124
constrained by the thought
of Ben checking up

129
00:11:58,208 --> 00:12:00,124
on your innermost thoughts and feelings.

130
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,915
lf l don't tell Ben, how will l know
the camera even exists?

131
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:26,749
You could hide it
at the bottom of your wardrobe.

132
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:28,374
At the back.

133
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:32,207
l'll call you in the morning
to remind you.

134
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:36,415
Was that a yes or a no?

135
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:43,665
l want to get well.

136
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:57,082
♫ You still wanna be just friends

137
00:12:58,125 --> 00:13:01,999
♫ But how can we still be friends
when seeing you...

138
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:07,915
♫ And there ain't nothing
l can do about it

139
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:23,165
My name...

140
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:26,082
My name is Christine Lucas.
l'm 40, 40 years old

141
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:27,582
and l'm an amnesiac.

142
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:30,874
♫ Get out my life why don't ya, babe?

143
00:13:31,166 --> 00:13:36,124
Tonight, as l sleep,
my mind will erase everything l know,

144
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:38,832
everything l did today.
And l will wake up tomorrow...

145
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:43,540
And the truth is half my life is over.

146
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:45,790
And l...

147
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,707
Oh, shit. He's coming.

148
00:14:05,666 --> 00:14:07,082
Christine?

149
00:14:53,041 --> 00:14:55,040
We've been married for 14 years.

150
00:14:57,416 --> 00:14:59,457
We met during your last term at King's.

151
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:01,665
You were doing an MA in History.

152
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:03,957
We got married
a couple of years after that.

153
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:06,707
l still teach at a school
round the corner.

154
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:10,290
l'm the head of
the chemistry department.

155
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:15,624
What do l do?

156
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:18,499
You stay at home.

157
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:20,540
What, l don't do anything? l don't...

158
00:15:20,625 --> 00:15:24,999
l don't study? l don't work from home?
l just sit around all day?

159
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:27,165
You store up information for a day.

160
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:30,415
And when you wake up in the morning,
it's all gone.

161
00:15:31,666 --> 00:15:33,915
You're back to your early 20s, Chris.

162
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:42,540
And tonight,
as l sleep, my mind...

163
00:15:42,625 --> 00:15:45,332
My mind will erase everything
that l know,

164
00:15:45,416 --> 00:15:47,499
everything that l did today.

165
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:50,415
And l will wake up tomorrow,
like l did this morning,

166
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:53,457
thinking that l have
my whole life ahead of me.

167
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:59,082
God, without this, l would believe
anything that he says. Anything.

168
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:01,124
That you had a car accident?

169
00:16:03,208 --> 00:16:05,332
l wonder what else he lies about?

170
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:08,265
lf we want to keep this
between ourselves,

171
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:11,957
l can't risk calling on the house phone
when Ben's home.

172
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:14,249
Why is he hiding the attack?

173
00:16:15,458 --> 00:16:17,374
Perhaps it's just easier.

174
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:22,040
- God!
- Sorry.

175
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:28,415
l wish l wasn't so frightened
all of the time.

176
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,374
Do you really think this is a good idea?

177
00:16:30,458 --> 00:16:32,040
There are plenty of
case histories of patients

178
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:34,082
going back to where
they suffered trauma.

179
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:37,249
Actually, it's very rarely effective.

180
00:16:38,291 --> 00:16:39,749
So why are we doing it?

181
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:42,790
We're building trust.

182
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:57,165
Hang on a minute.

183
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:59,332
- Mr Nancarrow?
- Yeah.

184
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:01,540
l'm Dr Nasch, we spoke on the phone.

185
00:17:02,291 --> 00:17:03,915
Dr Nasch, yeah.

186
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,415
l'll have to call you back.

187
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:17,832
Careful.

188
00:17:25,916 --> 00:17:27,874
Got quite a fright when l first saw you.

189
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:32,540
Here, just down here.

190
00:17:34,666 --> 00:17:36,207
That's where l found you.

191
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:41,165
Would you describe
exactly what you saw?

192
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:43,170
l don't know,
it was a long time ago.

193
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:45,374
Well, just tell us
what you remember.

194
00:17:45,541 --> 00:17:47,040
l'd just come off shift.

195
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:50,665
Miss Lucas was naked.

196
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,415
- Naked?
- Apart from a sheet.

197
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:55,290
A bed sheet or a plastic sheet?

198
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,415
l'd have said if it was plastic.

199
00:17:57,625 --> 00:17:59,332
Where did l come from?

200
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:01,457
You couldn't remember.

201
00:18:01,875 --> 00:18:04,415
You were very confused.

202
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:06,457
There was blood.

203
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:09,290
My blood?

204
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:11,165
Where?

205
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,124
Everywhere.

206
00:18:22,791 --> 00:18:24,790
What was l doing by the airport?

207
00:18:27,833 --> 00:18:30,790
Well, there are a lot of hotels
in the area.

208
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:33,499
Dozens.

209
00:18:33,958 --> 00:18:35,957
Hotels?

210
00:18:36,875 --> 00:18:38,790
lt would explain the bed sheet.

211
00:18:39,458 --> 00:18:41,957
l live here.
Why would l be staying in a hotel?

212
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,207
All sorts of reasons.

213
00:18:52,166 --> 00:18:55,874
The medical examination
indicated recent sexual intercourse.

214
00:18:58,916 --> 00:19:01,082
There was no trace of semen

215
00:19:01,166 --> 00:19:04,999
or anything to help the police
identify the man you slept with.

216
00:19:07,791 --> 00:19:09,415
Was l raped?

217
00:19:10,458 --> 00:19:14,415
The police report suggested not.

218
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,207
l'm married. l don't think
l would be the kind of person

219
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:20,957
who would cheat on my husband.

220
00:19:23,916 --> 00:19:25,832
How do you know?

221
00:19:32,708 --> 00:19:34,665
Whatever happened that night,

222
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:39,290
whatever l've done,

223
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:44,165
l have to remember.

224
00:19:45,458 --> 00:19:47,124
l know l do.

225
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:49,082
l have to, for us.

226
00:19:52,916 --> 00:19:54,332
For us.

227
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:36,665
Chris?

228
00:21:37,541 --> 00:21:38,957
No.

229
00:21:41,625 --> 00:21:42,625
No!

230
00:22:23,458 --> 00:22:25,999
Christine, could you
open your eyes, please?

231
00:22:26,541 --> 00:22:29,290
We're going to show you some pictures.
And l want you to look at each one

232
00:22:29,375 --> 00:22:31,165
and tell yourself what or who it is.

233
00:22:32,583 --> 00:22:34,290
Go ahead.

234
00:23:11,583 --> 00:23:12,999
Are you okay?

235
00:23:20,083 --> 00:23:22,290
Some of the photographs
were taken from random,

236
00:23:22,375 --> 00:23:23,957
others from your file.

237
00:23:24,958 --> 00:23:27,290
This caused distinct neural excitation.

238
00:23:31,833 --> 00:23:33,915
Who is she?

239
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:37,957
Did l have a friend?

240
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:40,415
Of course. You had a lot.
You were very popular.

241
00:23:41,666 --> 00:23:43,540
With red hair?

242
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:48,374
- Not that l recall.
- Called Claire.

243
00:23:49,625 --> 00:23:52,540
Claire? lt doesn't ring a bell. Why?

244
00:23:54,375 --> 00:23:56,040
You're absolutely certain?

245
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:58,707
Well, l mean, it's possible.
You had a lot of friends. Why?

246
00:24:01,458 --> 00:24:03,415
lt's just, l, uh...

247
00:24:03,666 --> 00:24:05,082
l had a memory.

248
00:24:05,333 --> 00:24:06,749
A memory?

249
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:12,207
Mmm, well, sort of. l guess.

250
00:24:12,958 --> 00:24:14,957
That's great. What kind of memory?

251
00:24:15,916 --> 00:24:19,249
Claire. She had red hair.
She was a friend.

252
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:21,499
A good friend, l think.

253
00:24:22,208 --> 00:24:23,790
Well, l mean...

254
00:24:24,541 --> 00:24:27,624
l suppose you might have done, once.
Years ago.

255
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,415
Claire...

256
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,749
There might have been a Claire.

257
00:24:33,458 --> 00:24:34,957
A friend from college.

258
00:24:35,916 --> 00:24:36,999
There was a girl you were close to.

259
00:24:37,083 --> 00:24:39,665
l mean, she might have been
called Claire.

260
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:41,499
So what happened to her?

261
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:45,165
What?

262
00:24:46,875 --> 00:24:49,207
This isn't the first time
you've remembered Claire.

263
00:24:51,791 --> 00:24:53,499
l don't understand.

264
00:24:54,083 --> 00:24:55,790
lt's not something we talk about.

265
00:24:57,166 --> 00:24:58,582
Why not?

266
00:24:59,666 --> 00:25:01,332
You drifted apart.

267
00:25:02,708 --> 00:25:04,040
Why?

268
00:25:04,125 --> 00:25:06,874
A couple of years after your accident,
she moved away.

269
00:25:06,958 --> 00:25:09,165
- Where to?
- Canada, l think.

270
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:10,665
You think?

271
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:12,332
Truth is it didn't really matter to you
where she went.

272
00:25:12,416 --> 00:25:13,707
You couldn't remember her
from one day to...

273
00:25:13,791 --> 00:25:15,749
lt matters. lt matters now.

274
00:25:22,166 --> 00:25:24,165
Don't say l didn't warn you.

275
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:39,457
l keep them in my study.

276
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:46,915
You hide them?

277
00:25:47,583 --> 00:25:49,207
They upset you.

278
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:51,040
You hide a piece of my past from me?

279
00:25:51,125 --> 00:25:52,665
- To protect you.
- From what?

280
00:25:54,583 --> 00:25:55,999
She couldn't handle it, Chris.

281
00:25:56,083 --> 00:25:57,915
She couldn't handle knowing that
1 5 minutes after she left,

282
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,790
you had no idea she even existed.

283
00:26:02,083 --> 00:26:04,374
After a while, she stopped calling
or even...

284
00:26:06,458 --> 00:26:10,624
- She wasn't the only one, Chris.
- How can l trust you if you lie to me?

285
00:26:13,291 --> 00:26:16,249
l live with you. With this.

286
00:26:17,291 --> 00:26:19,332
Sometimes, when the truth
is painful or complicated,

287
00:26:19,416 --> 00:26:20,624
l don't always have the strength.

288
00:26:20,708 --> 00:26:22,790
Usually l do, but not always.
l'm sorry.

289
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:26,915
- So, what, you edit my life?
- This isn't just about you!

290
00:26:27,375 --> 00:26:29,124
Sometimes this is a question
of what l can handle

291
00:26:29,208 --> 00:26:31,124
and l can't always handle everything!

292
00:26:31,958 --> 00:26:33,457
Not every day.

293
00:26:34,875 --> 00:26:37,457
Sometimes we both need a day off.

294
00:26:45,208 --> 00:26:46,665
He's keeping
Claire from you.

295
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:49,290
He says he's protecting you but he...

296
00:26:50,083 --> 00:26:51,582
Don't trust him.

297
00:26:51,666 --> 00:26:53,249
Don't trust Ben.

298
00:27:21,541 --> 00:27:23,540
- Hello?
- Christine?

299
00:27:24,125 --> 00:27:26,082
Hello, it's Dr Nasch.

300
00:27:26,916 --> 00:27:30,457
You won't remember me,
but we've been meeting almost every day

301
00:27:30,541 --> 00:27:32,707
for the last few weeks... A camera...

302
00:27:32,791 --> 00:27:34,249
lt's in a shoe box

303
00:27:34,333 --> 00:27:37,165
somewhere on the bottom shelf of
the cupboard nearest the bathroom.

304
00:27:37,375 --> 00:27:39,332
He's keeping
Claire from you.

305
00:27:39,583 --> 00:27:41,332
He says he's protecting...

306
00:27:42,166 --> 00:27:43,582
Claire...

307
00:27:43,666 --> 00:27:44,999
He's keeping Claire...

308
00:27:45,083 --> 00:27:48,540
He says he's protecting you,
but he's keeping Claire from you.

309
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:52,749
Don't trust Ben.

310
00:28:15,375 --> 00:28:16,375
Bastard.

311
00:29:14,083 --> 00:29:15,707
Are you all right?

312
00:29:17,166 --> 00:29:18,749
l'm pregnant.

313
00:29:45,583 --> 00:29:47,583
"When you
wake up in the morning, Pooh,

314
00:29:47,875 --> 00:29:50,290
"what's the first thing
you say to yourself?"

315
00:29:50,833 --> 00:29:54,582
"'What's for breakfast?'
What do you say, Piglet?"

316
00:29:58,958 --> 00:30:02,665
"l say, 'l wonder what's going
to happen exciting today?"'

317
00:30:08,416 --> 00:30:10,040
- We have a child.
- Chris...

318
00:30:10,125 --> 00:30:12,415
We have a child, a little boy, don't we?

319
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:13,915
Don't we?

320
00:30:14,666 --> 00:30:22,666
Where is he?

321
00:30:28,958 --> 00:30:31,665
- Come inside. Come inside.
- No. Where is he?

322
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:33,350
l can't talk to you
standing in the rain.

323
00:30:33,375 --> 00:30:36,874
Why are you hiding him from me?
Where is my son?

324
00:30:37,166 --> 00:30:38,915
- l'm not hiding. Come inside, please.
- Where is he?

325
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,040
- Would you just come inside now...
- No, l'm not coming inside!

326
00:30:41,125 --> 00:30:43,999
Come here... Come here. Come here
and l'll tell you, l'll tell you.

327
00:30:44,083 --> 00:30:45,624
- Come here.
- Where...

328
00:30:46,041 --> 00:30:48,332
He died. We have a son
but he's dead. He died.

329
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,874
- No!
- He died. Please.

330
00:30:51,333 --> 00:30:53,165
No!

331
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:54,624
Chris...

332
00:30:54,708 --> 00:30:56,624
Chris, here. Come on.

333
00:31:04,291 --> 00:31:05,749
How?

334
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,415
Meningitis.

335
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:13,665
How old?

336
00:31:14,041 --> 00:31:15,457
Eight.

337
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:19,624
Adam died about three weeks
before his ninth birthday.

338
00:31:37,666 --> 00:31:40,165
l keep these in the garage for safety.

339
00:31:44,708 --> 00:31:46,665
There are some things it wouldn't
be good for you to stumble on

340
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:48,165
when you're by yourself, Christine.

341
00:31:48,583 --> 00:31:50,624
Some things it's better
l explain to you.

342
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,832
This is Adam as a baby.

343
00:32:07,291 --> 00:32:08,915
That's my baby?

344
00:32:10,958 --> 00:32:12,457
Adam.

345
00:32:18,958 --> 00:32:22,540
He would have been
about three months old there.

346
00:32:22,625 --> 00:32:26,124
- When was he born?
- August 4th, 1 999.

347
00:32:38,958 --> 00:32:40,374
Adam.

348
00:32:44,666 --> 00:32:46,499
Adam Thomas Lucas.

349
00:32:51,166 --> 00:32:52,957
Beautiful.

350
00:33:09,875 --> 00:33:12,082
"l am sick, please come home."

351
00:33:13,875 --> 00:33:15,082
Where was l?

352
00:33:15,541 --> 00:33:17,707
ln and out of hospitals.

353
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:26,207
- Chris.
- No.

354
00:33:29,416 --> 00:33:32,624
l can't do it.
l can't do this, l'm so sorry.

355
00:33:40,416 --> 00:33:42,707
Ben's been
through all this before.

356
00:33:43,083 --> 00:33:44,915
His grief isn't new.

357
00:33:45,916 --> 00:33:47,665
But it's new for me.

358
00:33:53,916 --> 00:33:55,957
And it'll be new tomorrow.

359
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,290
And it'll be new the next day
and it'll be new the next day

360
00:34:00,375 --> 00:34:02,999
and the next, and the next
and every day.

361
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,415
Every day for the rest of my life.

362
00:34:22,750 --> 00:34:24,207
No!

363
00:34:43,541 --> 00:34:45,874
His grief isn't new.
Mine is.

364
00:34:47,208 --> 00:34:48,624
Mine is.

365
00:34:51,291 --> 00:34:55,040
This isn't new for him.
His grief isn't new. Mine is.

366
00:34:57,791 --> 00:34:59,207
Mine is.

367
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,915
And it'll be new tomorrow.

368
00:35:05,041 --> 00:35:06,749
And it'll be new the next day

369
00:35:06,833 --> 00:35:09,499
and it'll be new the next day
and the next and the next

370
00:35:09,583 --> 00:35:11,082
and every day.

371
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,415
Every day for the rest of my life.

372
00:36:21,125 --> 00:36:25,665
- Did you know about Adam?
- We've spoken about Adam.

373
00:36:27,416 --> 00:36:30,832
Maybe Ben's right.
Maybe it's better l don't know.

374
00:36:40,208 --> 00:36:42,082
Can we just sit here a while?

375
00:36:45,583 --> 00:36:47,249
Of course.

376
00:36:57,166 --> 00:36:58,832
Should l tell Ben?

377
00:37:02,166 --> 00:37:03,624
About us?

378
00:37:05,958 --> 00:37:07,624
About the therapy?

379
00:37:21,541 --> 00:37:25,415
Was l a good mother?
l mean, before the injury.

380
00:37:27,916 --> 00:37:29,915
You were a wonderful mother.

381
00:37:34,958 --> 00:37:38,082
lt must have been awful for him,
me not knowing who he was.

382
00:37:44,041 --> 00:37:45,957
You loved Adam very much.

383
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:10,207
l understand why you would
hide this from me, l do.

384
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,790
And you've probably lived through this
more times than you can bear.

385
00:38:13,875 --> 00:38:15,582
And l understand there must be days
when you say,

386
00:38:15,666 --> 00:38:18,499
"l can't,
l can't go through this again."

387
00:38:20,208 --> 00:38:23,582
But if you care about this marriage,
and l have to assume you do,

388
00:38:23,666 --> 00:38:27,040
never try to hide my son from me again.

389
00:38:30,375 --> 00:38:37,249
l'm sorry.

390
00:39:14,333 --> 00:39:15,832
Adam?

391
00:39:35,083 --> 00:39:36,332
Mike.

392
00:39:45,666 --> 00:39:48,540
Good morning, Christine.
lt's Dr Nasch.

393
00:39:49,541 --> 00:39:51,957
l'm a neuropsychologist
at University College, London,

394
00:39:52,041 --> 00:39:54,121
and l've been calling you
every morning to remind you

395
00:39:54,166 --> 00:39:57,707
to look for the camera
hidden in the back of your wardrobe.

396
00:39:58,333 --> 00:40:00,415
You've been keeping a video diary...

397
00:40:00,916 --> 00:40:03,874
Get ready, then l can come
and pick you up from home.

398
00:40:12,291 --> 00:40:13,707
Mike.

399
00:40:13,916 --> 00:40:15,332
What?

400
00:40:15,416 --> 00:40:18,207
l'm not sure
but l think that's his name.

401
00:40:20,083 --> 00:40:21,499
Whose name?

402
00:40:24,166 --> 00:40:26,665
The man who did this to me.

403
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:30,374
Come here.

404
00:40:31,625 --> 00:40:33,040
Come on.

405
00:40:33,833 --> 00:40:35,665
Come here, come on. lt's okay.

406
00:40:36,458 --> 00:40:38,249
lt's okay.

407
00:40:53,875 --> 00:40:56,540
You're the only one
who makes me feel good.

408
00:40:58,625 --> 00:41:01,165
l want you to feel good.

409
00:41:19,625 --> 00:41:20,665
Christine, l'm sorry.

410
00:42:07,625 --> 00:42:10,207
Christine,
my name is Dr Nasch.

411
00:42:11,458 --> 00:42:13,749
- l know.
- How do you feel?

412
00:42:14,875 --> 00:42:16,290
Shitty.

413
00:42:16,666 --> 00:42:18,415
l only administered a mild sedative.

414
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:21,457
Just something to calm you down,
not put you to sleep.

415
00:42:23,208 --> 00:42:25,499
- l remember.
- You were confused.

416
00:42:26,666 --> 00:42:28,165
We call it confabulation,

417
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:31,290
your imagination filling in the gaps
in your memory,

418
00:42:31,375 --> 00:42:34,415
turning me into the man
who did this to you. Do you understand?

419
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:35,915
Ah...

420
00:42:36,166 --> 00:42:38,249
- l want to talk to Ben.
- No.

421
00:42:39,541 --> 00:42:41,207
No, l just found something out

422
00:42:41,291 --> 00:42:43,171
and l need to talk to you about it
face-to-face.

423
00:42:43,666 --> 00:42:45,582
Christine...

424
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:48,165
lt's about Ben.

425
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,457
Who were you talking to?

426
00:43:06,875 --> 00:43:08,290
When?

427
00:43:08,958 --> 00:43:11,332
When l called earlier.
lt went straight to voicemail.

428
00:43:11,416 --> 00:43:13,457
Oh, l was trying to call you.

429
00:43:22,333 --> 00:43:24,540
My name is Christine, Christine Lucas.

430
00:43:24,625 --> 00:43:27,290
l'm 40 years old and l'm an amnesiac.

431
00:43:27,375 --> 00:43:31,207
Tonight, as l sleep,
my mind will erase everything...

432
00:43:31,291 --> 00:43:34,207
This isn't new for him.
His grief isn't new. Mine is.

433
00:43:34,541 --> 00:43:36,207
You're vulnerable.

434
00:43:37,666 --> 00:43:40,915
Vulnerable patients often develop
feelings for their psychiatrists.

435
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,165
lt's common.

436
00:43:44,083 --> 00:43:47,582
What's less common nowadays
is when those feelings are reciprocated.

437
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:55,207
We call it counter-transference.
lt's unprofessional.

438
00:43:57,708 --> 00:43:59,665
Completely unprofessional.

439
00:44:00,166 --> 00:44:02,332
On my video,
l say that you're my only hope.

440
00:44:03,333 --> 00:44:06,540
l'm referring you to an excellent
neuropsychiatrist at St Thomas's.

441
00:44:07,541 --> 00:44:09,832
l say that we're making progress.

442
00:44:10,291 --> 00:44:14,874
Christine, l can't go on treating you.
lt wouldn't be ethical.

443
00:44:14,958 --> 00:44:16,874
- Please.
- Christine.

444
00:44:18,750 --> 00:44:22,457
She works out of the university
department at King's College.

445
00:44:22,541 --> 00:44:24,021
- She's very good.
- l don't want her.

446
00:44:24,041 --> 00:44:25,832
l want you. You're fixing me.

447
00:44:27,416 --> 00:44:29,207
When l called you this morning,

448
00:44:30,375 --> 00:44:32,499
you'd already watched your video diary.

449
00:44:34,375 --> 00:44:35,915
You remembered.

450
00:44:38,541 --> 00:44:41,124
Yes. Yes!

451
00:44:41,416 --> 00:44:43,207
Unfortunately, what you remember one day

452
00:44:43,291 --> 00:44:45,540
you may not necessarily
remember the next.

453
00:44:46,583 --> 00:44:48,082
Even the most significant things.

454
00:44:49,708 --> 00:44:51,374
What things?

455
00:44:53,958 --> 00:44:58,207
Ben had you transferred
from the psychiatric hospital in 2007

456
00:44:58,291 --> 00:45:01,124
to an adult community care centre.

457
00:45:01,208 --> 00:45:03,957
l rang the administrator the other day
to arrange a visit.

458
00:45:04,291 --> 00:45:08,499
lt seems your friend Claire
has been trying to get in touch.

459
00:45:10,375 --> 00:45:12,082
This is her number.

460
00:45:19,416 --> 00:45:22,957
The administrator asked
how you were and l told her.

461
00:45:23,041 --> 00:45:24,999
She became extremely confused.

462
00:45:26,416 --> 00:45:27,749
Why?

463
00:45:27,875 --> 00:45:29,832
Well, according to her records,

464
00:45:32,166 --> 00:45:33,749
Ben divorced you four years ago.

465
00:45:39,708 --> 00:45:42,124
Hi, you've reached Claire.
Leave a message.

466
00:45:42,541 --> 00:45:43,999
Claire, it's, uh...

467
00:45:44,083 --> 00:45:45,707
lt's Christine Lucas.

468
00:45:46,583 --> 00:45:49,290
Um, l really need to talk to you.

469
00:45:49,375 --> 00:45:51,335
Can you call me, please?
My number is, uh, zero...

470
00:46:08,125 --> 00:46:11,290
- We're divorced, aren't we?
- Who told you?

471
00:46:12,375 --> 00:46:15,040
Who told me? No one.
l'm remembering things.

472
00:46:15,125 --> 00:46:16,374
- Really?
- Yes.

473
00:46:16,458 --> 00:46:17,915
- You sure?
- Yes.

474
00:46:18,208 --> 00:46:20,790
- You're remembering an awful lot lately.
- Stay away.

475
00:46:22,208 --> 00:46:24,249
Just tell me the fucking truth.

476
00:46:24,541 --> 00:46:26,540
Why did you divorce me?

477
00:46:27,708 --> 00:46:29,874
- Why did you divorce me?
- You want the truth?

478
00:46:29,958 --> 00:46:31,374
- Yes.
- l'll tell you the truth!

479
00:46:31,458 --> 00:46:38,832
We had a little boy.

480
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:42,915
And he got very sick very suddenly
and we lost him.

481
00:46:51,583 --> 00:46:54,040
l walked away. l was in bits.

482
00:47:01,541 --> 00:47:03,457
l came back and l'm here.

483
00:47:06,583 --> 00:47:09,207
l'll never leave you, Chris. Never.

484
00:47:13,833 --> 00:47:15,415
l'm sorry.

485
00:47:50,833 --> 00:47:52,290
Hello?

486
00:47:52,458 --> 00:47:53,957
Chrissy?

487
00:47:58,250 --> 00:47:59,832
Claire?

488
00:47:59,958 --> 00:48:02,374
Oh, my God, Chrissy, darling,
is that really you?

489
00:48:07,083 --> 00:48:08,749
Yes, it's me.

490
00:48:11,083 --> 00:48:13,207
You call me Chrissy.

491
00:48:14,750 --> 00:48:17,415
l kept ringing the care centre.
Did they tell you?

492
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:20,540
They gave me your old address
and all my letters were returned.

493
00:48:21,541 --> 00:48:23,290
Every day, every single day,

494
00:48:23,375 --> 00:48:26,457
l've been waiting for this phone
to ring, hoping it might be you.

495
00:48:28,125 --> 00:48:31,207
They, um... They told me
that you moved away.

496
00:48:31,291 --> 00:48:32,707
- Moved away?
- Yes.

497
00:48:32,791 --> 00:48:34,540
- Whatever gave you that idea?
- Um...

498
00:48:34,625 --> 00:48:37,832
Oh, my God, Chrissy.
l've missed you so much.

499
00:48:37,916 --> 00:48:40,749
- Oh...
- How are you?

500
00:48:42,541 --> 00:48:44,165
Um...

501
00:48:44,250 --> 00:48:47,415
Well, l can't remember a fucking thing
but otherwise l'm fine.

502
00:48:50,458 --> 00:48:52,582
- Where are you?
- Um...

503
00:48:53,333 --> 00:48:55,749
l'm at home. l'm with Ben.

504
00:48:57,125 --> 00:48:59,999
And l really need to see you.
Can l see you?

505
00:49:00,875 --> 00:49:02,457
Yeah. Um...

506
00:49:02,541 --> 00:49:05,082
l'd rather not come to you, Chris.

507
00:49:05,583 --> 00:49:06,790
Why?

508
00:49:06,875 --> 00:49:09,915
lt's difficult to explain
over a phone...

509
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:12,957
How about we meet at the Observatory?

510
00:49:13,875 --> 00:49:14,999
Um...

511
00:49:15,083 --> 00:49:16,790
- The Observe...
- ln Greenwich.

512
00:49:16,875 --> 00:49:18,540
l could be there in an hour.

513
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:23,582
Will you be okay?

514
00:49:29,833 --> 00:49:32,499
Yes, l'm fine and l'll be there.

515
00:50:07,791 --> 00:50:09,374
Chrissy?

516
00:50:11,833 --> 00:50:14,499
Chrissy, darling, it's me, Claire.

517
00:50:16,333 --> 00:50:24,290
Claire.

518
00:50:25,375 --> 00:50:26,874
Oh...

519
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,790
l remember you.

520
00:50:37,875 --> 00:50:39,374
Yeah?

521
00:50:42,125 --> 00:50:43,624
Oh...

522
00:50:43,958 --> 00:50:46,290
l've missed you, l've missed you,
l've missed you!

523
00:50:46,375 --> 00:50:48,124
l remember you.

524
00:50:49,875 --> 00:50:52,290
l've missed you so much.

525
00:50:53,708 --> 00:50:55,124
Oh...

526
00:50:55,208 --> 00:50:57,540
This is amazing.

527
00:51:01,583 --> 00:51:03,624
Was l a good mother?

528
00:51:03,708 --> 00:51:07,540
Oh, Chrissy.
Nobody was more loved than Adam.

529
00:51:08,083 --> 00:51:10,915
Ben used to rush home from work
just to see his little boy.

530
00:51:11,291 --> 00:51:13,832
Adam was so like him at that age.

531
00:51:14,541 --> 00:51:17,207
Even then he was just as handsome
as his daddy.

532
00:51:21,750 --> 00:51:23,957
Who did this to me?

533
00:51:27,666 --> 00:51:29,999
Things were tough.

534
00:51:30,916 --> 00:51:33,290
You were juggling looking after Adam

535
00:51:33,375 --> 00:51:35,374
and starting a new teaching job.

536
00:51:37,250 --> 00:51:38,874
You and Ben were arguing a lot.

537
00:51:39,375 --> 00:51:42,457
l said l'd look after Adam
two afternoons a week.

538
00:51:43,875 --> 00:51:47,832
After a month or so back at work,
you seemed to get better, you...

539
00:51:49,083 --> 00:51:51,499
You even started dressing differently.

540
00:51:52,333 --> 00:51:54,749
l didn't realise
what it was at the time.

541
00:51:54,833 --> 00:51:56,540
l met someone?

542
00:51:57,250 --> 00:51:58,832
l asked you.

543
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:04,207
You denied it at first
but you knew l wasn't stupid.

544
00:52:05,750 --> 00:52:07,540
We had an argument.

545
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:10,165
Eventually, you told me the truth.

546
00:52:10,250 --> 00:52:11,790
l didn't tell you his name?

547
00:52:11,875 --> 00:52:13,915
You wouldn't give me
any details about him.

548
00:52:14,250 --> 00:52:15,915
Did Ben know?

549
00:52:16,166 --> 00:52:17,874
Not until the police found you.

550
00:52:18,125 --> 00:52:19,999
Oh, Jesus.

551
00:52:21,125 --> 00:52:23,207
Oh, poor Ben.

552
00:52:23,291 --> 00:52:24,790
l had to tell him, Chrissy.

553
00:52:24,875 --> 00:52:27,499
l'd already told the police.
l had no choice.

554
00:52:28,208 --> 00:52:30,707
No wonder he keeps lying to me.

555
00:52:30,791 --> 00:52:32,415
Well, that's Ben.

556
00:52:32,958 --> 00:52:35,165
- Protecting you.
- Maybe.

557
00:52:36,333 --> 00:52:39,749
Or maybe he thinks we just can't
come to terms with the truth.

558
00:52:40,416 --> 00:52:42,136
l mean, he still lies to me
about the attack

559
00:52:42,208 --> 00:52:43,790
and he never talks to me about you.

560
00:52:46,083 --> 00:52:47,540
Well...

561
00:52:48,666 --> 00:52:53,249
There's a reason why
he doesn't talk about me to you.

562
00:52:54,291 --> 00:52:55,749
Why?

563
00:52:57,458 --> 00:52:59,457
After your accident,

564
00:53:00,375 --> 00:53:02,582
l tried to help out.

565
00:53:02,666 --> 00:53:05,332
You can imagine how hard it was for Ben
looking after Adam.

566
00:53:05,666 --> 00:53:07,540
l did what l could.

567
00:53:08,708 --> 00:53:10,207
We spent a lot of time together.

568
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:12,582
One day, after visiting you, he just...

569
00:53:13,833 --> 00:53:16,499
collapsed.
He said he couldn't go on any more.

570
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,582
l...

571
00:53:20,541 --> 00:53:22,457
l put my arms around him.

572
00:53:22,916 --> 00:53:24,832
We got carried away.

573
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:27,582
lt only happened once.

574
00:53:29,583 --> 00:53:31,415
l felt so bad.

575
00:53:32,333 --> 00:53:34,415
We both felt so bad.

576
00:53:35,375 --> 00:53:37,665
l decided l owed it to both of you
to stay away

577
00:53:37,750 --> 00:53:39,540
so l just...

578
00:53:41,458 --> 00:53:43,207
disappeared.

579
00:53:45,791 --> 00:53:47,374
l'm so sorry.

580
00:53:50,625 --> 00:53:53,540
Well, you can hardly blame us,
Christine, after your affair.

581
00:53:54,333 --> 00:53:56,415
You don't know how lucky you are.

582
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:59,332
You have never known
how lucky you are to have Ben.

583
00:54:01,125 --> 00:54:03,249
- l have to go.
- Oh, Chrissy...

584
00:54:03,333 --> 00:54:05,415
- Ben will be home soon and...
- Please.

585
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:08,249
- He'll worry if l'm not there.
- Look, just wait.

586
00:54:11,416 --> 00:54:14,582
Ben sent this to me
shortly before you separated.

587
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:19,290
He asked me to give it to you
if you were ever well enough to read it.

588
00:54:23,208 --> 00:54:25,249
l'm so glad that you are.

589
00:54:25,541 --> 00:54:28,332
l don't expect you to believe me
but l care about you, Christine.

590
00:54:28,916 --> 00:54:30,374
A lot.

591
00:54:32,583 --> 00:54:34,249
lt's all right.

592
00:54:44,583 --> 00:54:46,249
"My darling Christine,

593
00:54:48,083 --> 00:54:50,415
"l can't bear to say the words

594
00:54:50,916 --> 00:54:53,332
"but l have decided to leave you.

595
00:54:53,791 --> 00:54:56,957
"l've tried so hard
to find another way, Chris.

596
00:54:57,458 --> 00:54:59,207
"Please believe me.

597
00:55:00,750 --> 00:55:02,707
"You loved Adam,

598
00:55:03,583 --> 00:55:05,957
"even if you couldn't
consciously remember him.

599
00:55:06,833 --> 00:55:09,540
"He would run into your arms
and you would pick him up

600
00:55:10,291 --> 00:55:12,915
"and for a while, you sensed who he was.

601
00:55:14,291 --> 00:55:15,790
"Then you started to believe

602
00:55:15,875 --> 00:55:18,915
"that Adam had been taken away from you
when he was a baby.

603
00:55:19,583 --> 00:55:22,582
"Every time you saw him,
you thought it was for the first time.

604
00:55:24,916 --> 00:55:28,165
"l'd ask him to tell you
when he last saw you, and he'd say,

605
00:55:28,958 --> 00:55:30,707
"'Yesterday, Mummy.'

606
00:55:30,791 --> 00:55:32,999
"But you wouldn't believe him.

607
00:55:33,583 --> 00:55:36,749
"One day you attacked me,
grabbed Adam and ran.

608
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:39,207
"He started screaming.

609
00:55:39,291 --> 00:55:42,415
"Later, l tried to explain
but he didn't understand.

610
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:44,790
"He became frightened
to come and see you.

611
00:55:46,625 --> 00:55:50,124
"l left it a few days and then called
to find out how you were.

612
00:55:50,208 --> 00:55:52,415
"They said you were happy.

613
00:55:53,458 --> 00:55:56,332
"When l asked them
if you remembered us,

614
00:55:56,416 --> 00:55:58,165
"they said no.

615
00:56:01,041 --> 00:56:03,665
"l love you so much, Chris.

616
00:56:03,750 --> 00:56:07,457
"l love you more than
l love anything or anyone in this world.

617
00:56:08,583 --> 00:56:11,207
"But our son is only eight years old.

618
00:56:12,750 --> 00:56:15,082
"He's desperately unhappy, Chris.

619
00:56:15,875 --> 00:56:19,374
"And l just can't put him through
that kind of trauma again.

620
00:56:20,958 --> 00:56:23,582
"l want you both to be happy,

621
00:56:23,666 --> 00:56:27,040
"even if you can only
find that happiness without us.

622
00:56:28,125 --> 00:56:30,540
"Forgive me. Ben."

623
00:56:36,958 --> 00:56:38,915
l forgive you.

624
00:56:40,125 --> 00:56:42,207
Can you forgive me?

625
00:56:45,916 --> 00:56:49,290
You're my lover. You're my protector.

626
00:56:49,916 --> 00:56:53,082
And my life is nothing,
nothing without you.

627
00:56:56,833 --> 00:57:00,124
By the time you see this,
you will know everything.

628
00:57:02,750 --> 00:57:06,832
And you will know that there is nothing
inside me for you now but love.

629
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:13,540
And the hope that we can finally
find a way to truly be together.

630
00:57:16,250 --> 00:57:17,790
Hello?

631
00:57:19,333 --> 00:57:20,832
Chris?

632
00:57:21,166 --> 00:57:22,665
l forgive you.

633
00:57:24,750 --> 00:57:26,999
Can you forgive me?

634
00:57:27,083 --> 00:57:31,040
You're my lover. You're my protector.
You're my... You're my everything.

635
00:57:31,125 --> 00:57:34,249
So by the time you see this,
you will know everything.

636
00:57:34,333 --> 00:57:35,749
You will know that there...

637
00:57:36,916 --> 00:57:38,716
No, l want you to watch it
from the beginning.

638
00:57:39,083 --> 00:57:41,415
What do you mean,
"you will know everything"?

639
00:57:45,458 --> 00:57:48,332
l've been seeing a doctor, Dr Nasch.

640
00:57:49,333 --> 00:57:51,082
For a few weeks.

641
00:57:52,791 --> 00:57:54,790
He gave me the camera.

642
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:00,124
He's been calling me
every morning to remind me.

643
00:58:01,291 --> 00:58:03,082
Why would you do that?

644
00:58:04,125 --> 00:58:05,582
To hold on to my memories.

645
00:58:05,666 --> 00:58:07,346
No, l mean, why would you
keep it a secret?

646
00:58:07,416 --> 00:58:09,415
Because l wasn't sure
if l could trust you.

647
00:58:13,125 --> 00:58:15,499
- l know now l can.
- Are you having an affair?

648
00:58:15,583 --> 00:58:18,957
No.

649
00:58:19,041 --> 00:58:21,332
l know how much l hurt you.

650
00:58:21,875 --> 00:58:25,540
l know what it's taken
for you to forgive me and l...

651
00:58:25,625 --> 00:58:29,249
l understand why you left.
l understand everything now.

652
00:58:29,625 --> 00:58:31,207
Ben...

653
00:58:32,083 --> 00:58:35,874
You're so good to me.
l love you. l love you so...

654
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:54,749
He did what?

655
00:58:55,250 --> 00:58:56,999
Let me talk to him.

656
00:58:57,083 --> 00:58:59,999
He, uh... He left.

657
00:59:01,375 --> 00:59:03,290
l'm going to call him.

658
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:05,540
l don't think that's a good idea.

659
00:59:05,625 --> 00:59:07,082
Look, l love you both.

660
00:59:07,166 --> 00:59:08,874
God.

661
00:59:11,083 --> 00:59:12,707
l'll call you right back.

662
00:59:23,083 --> 00:59:24,915
Ben hit me.

663
00:59:25,625 --> 00:59:27,290
l, um...

664
00:59:27,375 --> 00:59:30,540
told him everything and he hit me.

665
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:34,957
And nothing can alter that, so...

666
00:59:37,916 --> 00:59:38,957
Ah...

667
00:59:42,916 --> 00:59:45,332
- Hello?
- l spoke to Ben.

668
00:59:46,666 --> 00:59:49,582
He says he's been living alone, Chris.

669
00:59:50,041 --> 00:59:51,124
What?

670
00:59:51,208 --> 00:59:54,832
Ben says he hasn't seen you
for four years.

671
00:59:54,916 --> 00:59:56,624
Christine,

672
00:59:57,458 --> 00:59:59,457
describe Ben to me.

673
01:00:02,166 --> 01:00:05,249
- What?
- Describe Ben to me.

674
01:00:05,583 --> 01:00:07,124
What does he look like?

675
01:00:07,208 --> 01:00:08,915
ls he tall?

676
01:00:11,625 --> 01:00:13,124
Yes.

677
01:00:13,208 --> 01:00:14,790
Black hair?

678
01:00:17,083 --> 01:00:20,415
No. No, he has brown hair.

679
01:00:22,583 --> 01:00:24,540
Does he have a scar?

680
01:00:26,166 --> 01:00:29,332
- A scar?
- Yeah. He had a skiing accident.

681
01:00:29,416 --> 01:00:32,332
He should have a scar
across the right side of his face.

682
01:00:49,125 --> 01:00:50,707
Chrissy?

683
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,999
No. No, he doesn't.

684
01:00:57,166 --> 01:00:58,582
Ben doesn't have a scar.

685
01:01:02,208 --> 01:01:03,874
The man you're living with,

686
01:01:04,250 --> 01:01:06,207
l don't know who he is, Christine.

687
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,790
But it's not Ben!

688
01:01:44,875 --> 01:01:46,165
Help me.

689
01:01:46,250 --> 01:01:49,457
l need your address, Christine.
l need to know where you're living.

690
01:01:51,083 --> 01:01:53,665
l can't... l can't remember.

691
01:02:01,166 --> 01:02:03,207
l'll be right out.

692
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:07,207
Find out quickly
and l'll call you back on your mobile.

693
01:05:13,500 --> 01:05:15,082
Who are you?

694
01:05:15,500 --> 01:05:18,165
l'm your husband. Ben.

695
01:05:27,500 --> 01:05:29,749
- Christine?
- Yes?

696
01:05:29,833 --> 01:05:33,082
lt's Dr Nasch. That'll mean
nothing to you, l know...

697
01:05:33,166 --> 01:05:34,832
We've been doing some work
on your memory.

698
01:05:34,916 --> 01:05:37,624
Trying to figure out precisely what...
Have you found the camera, Christine?

699
01:05:37,708 --> 01:05:39,124
Yes.

700
01:05:39,208 --> 01:05:41,249
Watch it and l'll call you back.

701
01:05:41,333 --> 01:05:44,124
You're my lover. You're my protector.

702
01:05:44,583 --> 01:05:46,874
My life is nothing without you.

703
01:05:48,041 --> 01:05:50,790
By the time you see this,
you will know everything

704
01:05:50,875 --> 01:05:55,207
and you will know that there is nothing
inside me for you now but love.

705
01:05:57,916 --> 01:06:02,124
And the hope that we can finally
find a way to truly be together.

706
01:06:26,833 --> 01:06:28,249
Hello?

707
01:06:28,333 --> 01:06:31,665
Christine, it's me. ls everything okay?

708
01:06:32,583 --> 01:06:34,707
Everything's fine.

709
01:06:41,416 --> 01:06:42,999
Ben?

710
01:06:43,750 --> 01:06:46,582
Sorry, yes, l heard. l'm in traffic.

711
01:06:50,125 --> 01:06:52,415
Just wanted to make sure
you remembered to pack

712
01:06:52,500 --> 01:06:54,165
for our anniversary.

713
01:06:55,250 --> 01:06:56,874
To pack?

714
01:06:57,958 --> 01:07:01,124
- l wrote it on the board in the kitchen.
- Yes, l remember.

715
01:07:01,750 --> 01:07:03,374
Ben...

716
01:07:05,666 --> 01:07:07,457
l love you.

717
01:07:09,583 --> 01:07:12,040
l love you, too, Christine.

718
01:07:41,958 --> 01:07:44,957
Dr Nasch, please come to main reception.

719
01:07:45,041 --> 01:07:47,332
Dr Nasch, please come to main reception.

720
01:07:58,666 --> 01:08:00,207
Dr Nasch?

721
01:08:01,666 --> 01:08:03,082
Can l help you?

722
01:08:06,500 --> 01:08:07,915
l'm Ben Lucas.

723
01:08:09,875 --> 01:08:12,832
Oh, Mr Lucas. How's Christine?

724
01:08:14,166 --> 01:08:15,749
How is she?

725
01:08:17,791 --> 01:08:20,332
Stay the fuck away from my wife.

726
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,665
- ls this really our anniversary?
- Yes.

727
01:09:17,958 --> 01:09:20,165
Our wedding anniversary?

728
01:09:21,041 --> 01:09:22,499
No.

729
01:09:23,208 --> 01:09:25,457
lt's a different kind of anniversary.

730
01:09:58,208 --> 01:10:00,374
Why have you brought me here?

731
01:10:25,041 --> 01:10:26,457
l want you to remember.

732
01:10:27,208 --> 01:10:31,374
Oh, Mike,
l can't do this, l can't. l'm married.

733
01:10:31,458 --> 01:10:33,165
Oh, Mike, l can't.

734
01:10:33,958 --> 01:10:35,665
How about this?

735
01:10:37,666 --> 01:10:45,207
Mike?

736
01:10:48,291 --> 01:10:49,749
Where's Ben?

737
01:10:50,333 --> 01:10:52,124
Ben left you.

738
01:10:56,791 --> 01:10:58,332
l didn't.

739
01:10:58,708 --> 01:11:00,665
l stayed close by.

740
01:11:01,333 --> 01:11:04,582
Watching over you. Protecting you.

741
01:11:04,916 --> 01:11:07,082
- Protecting me?
- Mmm.

742
01:11:07,166 --> 01:11:10,665
While your so-called husband
left you to rot in a care home,

743
01:11:10,750 --> 01:11:13,540
l watched you wither and die,
day by day.

744
01:11:14,750 --> 01:11:17,040
l couldn't stand it any longer.

745
01:11:18,625 --> 01:11:20,374
l had to get you out of there.

746
01:11:21,083 --> 01:11:22,707
They let you take me home?

747
01:11:22,791 --> 01:11:25,999
False documents and a fake smile.
l got you out in half an hour.

748
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:29,624
Do you honestly think
l'd have got away with this

749
01:11:29,708 --> 01:11:31,588
if anyone else gave a shit
about you, Christine?

750
01:11:33,625 --> 01:11:36,290
You know, this whole Ben charade
wasn't the point.

751
01:11:36,375 --> 01:11:42,499
The point...

752
01:11:45,583 --> 01:11:47,665
...was to care for you.

753
01:11:48,416 --> 01:11:51,999
Was to look after you. Was to love you.

754
01:11:58,083 --> 01:12:01,790
l honestly meant to tell you the truth
but you were so distraught and then...

755
01:12:03,333 --> 01:12:06,374
then the lie
just got bigger and bigger...

756
01:12:08,333 --> 01:12:10,874
You know what? l'm sick of explaining.

757
01:12:10,958 --> 01:12:13,040
And l'm tired of lying.

758
01:12:15,708 --> 01:12:18,665
That's why l brought you here.
To put an end to this.

759
01:12:20,375 --> 01:12:23,790
We're going to leave here,
not as Christine and Ben

760
01:12:23,875 --> 01:12:25,499
but as Christine and Mike.

761
01:12:25,583 --> 01:12:27,040
l can't keep doing this.

762
01:12:27,833 --> 01:12:30,665
Well, call Ben
and tell him the truth.

763
01:12:34,333 --> 01:12:36,665
- No.
- Tell him.

764
01:12:36,791 --> 01:12:38,999
Don't be ridiculous. l can't do that.

765
01:12:39,083 --> 01:12:40,249
Then l will.

766
01:12:41,958 --> 01:12:43,624
lf l were Ben, l'd want to know.

767
01:12:43,708 --> 01:12:45,124
Don't be a prick, Mike.

768
01:12:49,250 --> 01:12:50,665
You did this.

769
01:12:53,833 --> 01:12:54,874
No.

770
01:12:57,250 --> 01:12:58,790
No! No!

771
01:12:58,875 --> 01:13:00,582
What did you expect me to do?

772
01:13:00,666 --> 01:13:02,665
l tried talking to you,
you wouldn't listen.

773
01:13:02,916 --> 01:13:04,707
l'd never hurt you.

774
01:13:06,291 --> 01:13:07,571
l hate myself for what happened.

775
01:13:11,166 --> 01:13:13,499
lt's all right. Please don't leave.

776
01:13:15,416 --> 01:13:17,832
l'm scared.

777
01:13:22,166 --> 01:13:24,415
Don't leave.

778
01:13:30,708 --> 01:13:32,332
Go.

779
01:13:33,291 --> 01:13:34,707
Go, then.

780
01:13:35,250 --> 01:13:36,332
Thank you.

781
01:13:39,541 --> 01:13:42,082
What did you have to go and do that for?
You see, this is what l'm talking about.

782
01:13:42,166 --> 01:13:44,165
This is what happens!

783
01:13:45,500 --> 01:13:48,749
- God, l'm sorry.
- And will you stop fucking apologising!

784
01:13:52,166 --> 01:13:54,665
l just don't want to be Ben any more.

785
01:13:55,916 --> 01:13:58,707
Nothing...
l've nothing to live for except for you.

786
01:14:01,333 --> 01:14:02,915
Understand?

787
01:14:06,250 --> 01:14:07,499
Please let me go.

788
01:14:07,583 --> 01:14:10,582
No, we leave together
or we don't leave at all.

789
01:14:14,750 --> 01:14:21,624
Now...

790
01:14:22,166 --> 01:14:23,582
No more guilt.

791
01:14:28,375 --> 01:14:29,832
No more grief.

792
01:14:32,208 --> 01:14:33,874
No more battles to fight.

793
01:14:47,541 --> 01:14:48,999
Now...

794
01:14:50,708 --> 01:14:52,457
You're free.

795
01:15:00,333 --> 01:15:01,957
Come here.

796
01:15:03,833 --> 01:15:06,082
Come on.

797
01:15:09,083 --> 01:15:10,499
Come.

798
01:15:19,416 --> 01:15:20,874
Here.

799
01:15:26,458 --> 01:15:28,082
Come here.

800
01:15:33,041 --> 01:15:34,582
Kiss me.

801
01:15:43,291 --> 01:15:44,874
Again.

802
01:15:56,833 --> 01:15:58,499
Forget Ben.

803
01:15:59,541 --> 01:16:01,249
He's forgotten you.

804
01:16:02,458 --> 01:16:04,374
You must forget Adam.

805
01:16:05,250 --> 01:16:07,124
He's forgotten you.

806
01:16:08,458 --> 01:16:10,415
Adam's forgotten you.

807
01:16:11,333 --> 01:16:15,082
Adam?

808
01:16:21,625 --> 01:16:23,290
My son is alive?

809
01:16:48,541 --> 01:16:49,790
Ah!

810
01:16:55,625 --> 01:16:58,624
We leave together
or we don't leave at all.

811
01:16:58,875 --> 01:17:01,082
Do you understand me?

812
01:17:01,750 --> 01:17:03,540
Let me go, please. Let me go.

813
01:17:37,500 --> 01:17:38,915
Ah!

814
01:18:19,458 --> 01:18:24,082
My name is Christine Lucas.
l'm 40 years old and l'm an amnesiac.

815
01:18:24,166 --> 01:18:28,332
Tonight, as l sleep, my mind will erase
everything that l know,

816
01:18:28,416 --> 01:18:30,915
everything that l did today.

817
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,540
And l will wake up tomorrow
like l did this morning,

818
01:18:33,625 --> 01:18:36,374
thinking that l have my whole life
ahead of me.

819
01:18:38,541 --> 01:18:40,707
And the truth is, the truth is

820
01:18:40,791 --> 01:18:44,457
l will never let anyone
take my life from me again.

821
01:18:44,541 --> 01:18:48,165
And l will not wake up tomorrow
thinking that my son is dead.

822
01:18:48,833 --> 01:18:54,415
l will not.

823
01:19:24,083 --> 01:19:25,832
Christine?

824
01:19:28,333 --> 01:19:30,832
Christine, my name is Dr Nasch.

825
01:19:30,916 --> 01:19:33,957
l'm a neuropsychologist.
l treated you for several weeks.

826
01:19:37,791 --> 01:19:40,332
But l'm not here today as your doctor,

827
01:19:41,375 --> 01:19:43,374
l'm here as a friend.

828
01:19:45,791 --> 01:19:49,290
You have two cracked ribs,
mild concussion,

829
01:19:50,041 --> 01:19:51,665
so you'll need someone
to keep an eye on you

830
01:19:51,750 --> 01:19:53,374
but you're going to be fine.

831
01:19:54,041 --> 01:19:56,332
Your friend Claire
is coming by this afternoon

832
01:19:56,416 --> 01:19:58,665
to pick you up,
to take you home with her.

833
01:20:02,583 --> 01:20:04,332
Do you remember Claire?

834
01:20:12,625 --> 01:20:14,207
Red hair.

835
01:20:17,291 --> 01:20:18,999
That's very good.

836
01:20:21,250 --> 01:20:23,207
And you're safe now.

837
01:20:23,666 --> 01:20:26,165
The man that did this to you
is in police custody.

838
01:20:26,250 --> 01:20:28,790
He's going to be in prison
for a very long time.

839
01:20:32,083 --> 01:20:34,332
Can you recall anything at all
about last night?

840
01:20:46,750 --> 01:20:49,332
Christine, l've brought you a visitor.

841
01:20:49,791 --> 01:20:53,457
l'm hoping this may be the breakthrough
we've been looking for.

842
01:21:02,625 --> 01:21:04,499
That gentleman is Ben.

843
01:21:05,875 --> 01:21:08,582
You were married
but you've been apart for four years.

844
01:21:28,666 --> 01:21:30,665
She's awake.

845
01:21:31,125 --> 01:21:32,749
Thank you.

846
01:21:46,333 --> 01:21:47,957
Christine.

847
01:21:49,125 --> 01:21:50,665
lt's Ben.

848
01:21:53,291 --> 01:21:55,040
Your Ben.

849
01:21:59,666 --> 01:22:02,749
lf l'd have known
you were in any kind of danger,

850
01:22:03,125 --> 01:22:05,749
l'd never have stayed away.

851
01:22:06,750 --> 01:22:08,499
l had to.

852
01:22:11,083 --> 01:22:13,124
For Adam's sake.

853
01:22:28,958 --> 01:22:30,082
He's our son, Chris.

854
01:22:35,750 --> 01:22:38,082
And he loves you very much.

855
01:22:40,541 --> 01:22:42,415
We both do.

856
01:23:54,375 --> 01:23:59,832
Hi.

857
01:24:09,541 --> 01:24:11,165
l'm Adam.

858
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:17,457
Adam.

859
01:24:25,083 --> 01:24:26,415
"When...

860
01:24:26,500 --> 01:24:28,060
"When you wake up in the morning, Pooh,

861
01:24:28,125 --> 01:24:30,624
"what's the first thing
you say to yourself?"

862
01:24:35,208 --> 01:24:36,790
"l say...

863
01:24:39,041 --> 01:24:40,999
"'What's for breakfast?'

864
01:24:42,625 --> 01:24:44,707
"What do you say, Piglet?"

865
01:24:48,208 --> 01:24:50,499
"l say... l say...

866
01:24:52,375 --> 01:24:56,165
"'l wonder what's going to
happen exciting today?"'

867
01:25:04,041 --> 01:25:05,915
You remembered.

868
01:25:08,500 --> 01:25:10,124
Oh...

869
01:25:13,208 --> 01:25:20,332
Adam.

870
01:25:23,083 --> 01:25:31,083
l remember.

871
01:25:49,916 --> 01:25:51,499
Adam.

872
01:25:52,583 --> 01:25:54,582
My Adam.
