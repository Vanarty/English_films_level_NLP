Your Majesty.

00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:54,360
So, it is always the Sovereign
who begins the meal.

00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:04,040
It is absolutely forbidden to begin
before he, or she, takes their first bite.

00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,360
Yes, miss.

00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:10,040
During the meal,
when it is the first course,

6
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:13,640
you must only speak to the person
seated on your right until the end.
