2
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,600
Looking good...

3
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,900
Oh, yeah, nice to see you.

4
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:03,000
Hey...

5
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:05,200
That dress needs dry-cleaning.

6
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:08,800
- Here you go.
- Thank you kindly, Monica.

7
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,600
Monica, Monica?
Oh shit, Hillary.

8
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,000
Okay...

9
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:23,600
- Hi, Bill.
- Oh hey Snow white.

10
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Where's 11B?

11
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,200
Bingo.

12
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:33,400
What did you say
that thing was?

13
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,700
It's time for a little action.

14
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,100
Monica... It's Bill.

15
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:47,500
I've got some dictation
for you, Monica.

16
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,600
I've got a big secret
for you, Baby.

17
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:53,500
How did you get up here
so soon?

18
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,900
Monica.

19
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:12,300
Oh my eyes..
I can't see.

20
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,400
Who let you in.?

21
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,200
What happened...
Where's Monica?

22
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,300
What happened to Monica?

23
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,700
- How did you get in here?

24
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,300
She told me where the key was.

25
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,400
- I can't see.

26
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,200
Did she say it was ok to
dry-hump her roommate?

27
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:25,500
She said, you would be in the...

28
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,800
library cause you
were a geek...

29
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:29,500
I am not a geek..
God.

30
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,400
My God.
What was that, mace?

31
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,600
'Eternity', by Calvin Klein.

32
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,200
I gotta be so careful who I
get into bed with from now on.

33
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:50,500
It would be a big adjustment
for you, wouldn't it?

34
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
God.

35
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,500
I do that every time.

36
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,700
I've invented a solution
for that. Seriously.

37
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,200
It is something that
goes around the...

38
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:02,800
coffee cup, so you
don't burn your hand.

39
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:05,000
I'm gonna call it
'The Coffee Collar'.

40
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,100
Brilliant idea.

41
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,000
I know all about you.
I know you whole wrap.

42
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:10,500
- You do?
- Yeah. You're a senior...

43
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,200
who prays on freshmen.
You've slept...

44
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,500
with half my floor.

45
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,500
- Well, half your
floor was female.

46
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,500
Whatever.

47
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,700
And you once met Bono,

48
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,600
which I suspect is
total bullshit.

49
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:24,200
No, it's true.
He signed my CD.

50
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,300
It's upstairs in my room
with my...

51
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,400
'Coffee Collar',
if you wanna see it.

52
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:33,100
- Are you hitting on me?
- No. I'm going of your look.

53
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,300
- My look...
- Yeah, doggy bull look.

54
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:39,700
- Are you calling me a dog?
- No, it's a theory I have.

55
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,100
- Oh, Casanova has a theory.
- Yeah. When a girl...

56
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,800
is attracted to a
guy, she has a look.

57
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:44,900
It's her tell, like poker.

58
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,300
It's the same look a dog gets,

59
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,800
right before you
put down the bowl.

60
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:50,800
- You're offensive.
And you're crazy.

61
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,000
No, I'm honest.

62
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:53,800
I believe honesty is the best
policy.

63
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:54,400
Alright...

64
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,300
You want me to be
honest with you?

65
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,000
- Sure.
- I'm majoring in fine art.

66
00:03:59,100 --> 00:03:59,400
- Right.

67
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,100
I'm studying the
golden proportions...

68
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,900
of the human face. And you're
nose is bent and...

69
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,200
and it drips down
at the bottom.

70
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:06,400
A feature that is
accentuated...

71
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,200
by the thinness of
your upper lip.

72
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:09,000
And your eyes,

73
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,600
are too far apart,
but they have to be...

74
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:13,600
to accommodate that bent nose.
And I feel sorry for you,

75
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:15,900
that you have to validate
yourself through...

76
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,900
insatiable-meaning
less-ego-sport-sex,

77
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,700
with insecure girls
like my roommate.

78
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:24,900
I... Would never have sex with
someone... Like you.

79
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,100
Hey come here.

80
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,900
That was amazing.

81
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,500
- What was?
- The honesty.

82
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,200
That was better than sex
without the... The crying.

83
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:38,500
- Actually it did
feel pretty good.

84
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,300
Yeah, no one's ever...

85
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,400
been that honest
with me before.

86
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,200
It's called a friend.

87
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,600
I'm Tom, by the way.

88
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:45,400
- Hannah.
- Hannah? That's a palindrome.

89
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:48,200
Well, good night.

90
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:50,700
Good night.

91
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,400
- Your hands, Clammy...

92
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:57,000
Well, I can see that
you're knocked out.

93
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:05,800
Tom, is that you?
Can I see your Bono-autograph?

94
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,600
She's all yours, friend.

95
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:18,000
Monica, get some sleep.

96
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:30,800
MADE OF HONOR

97
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:38,700
Subs by: Macco

98
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,900
What time is it?

99
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:45,300
I'm late.

100
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,700
What are you doing tonight?

101
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:52,200
I don't do 'back to backs'.

102
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,500
- Isn't that what we
were doing last night?

103
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,300
No, that was
something different.

104
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,300
'Back to Backs' is
seeing each other two...

105
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,200
nights in a row. You
know I don't do that.

106
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,300
- Couldn't you just break
one of your stupid rules?

107
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,400
No.

108
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,500
- For me.

109
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,900
I'm sorry, but I
don't break the rules.

110
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,300
I have a rule about that.

111
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,800
See you next week.

112
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,400
Thanks.

113
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,600
- Excuse me.
- Sorry.

114
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:12,200
Can I get a grandee drip,
and a decaff,

115
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,500
triple grandee, non-fat,

116
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,600
extra hot, stirred
milk Como Macchiato.

117
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:18,000
With whip cream,
extra caramel.

118
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:21,600
Fill that 70% of the way.
Thank you.

119
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,500
Here, let me put a 'Coffee-
Collar' on that.

120
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,000
- Thank you.

121
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:31,700
I hear that the guy
that invented that...

122
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,700
gets a dime for each one used.
- You're kidding.

123
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:37,000
I am not.
That could add up.

124
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,800
I think I picked up
yours by accident.

125
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:40,700
Sorry about that.

126
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,100
- That's alright. Thank you.
- Any time.

127
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,600
Bye-bye.

128
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,400
Gloria.

129
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,200
Morning.

130
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:44,700
Good morning, Hannah.

131
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,700
Coffee, the way you like it.

132
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,000
Perfect timing. I
just finished...

133
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,400
working on his balls.

134
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:54,500
That's eh... Yeah.
So I made a reservation.

135
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
- So what rule is this?
- No 'back to backs'.

136
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,400
Isn't that the same as the...

137
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,800
'no more than once
a week'-rule?

138
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:01,900
No, the 'no more than
once a week'-rule...

139
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,500
works Monday to Fridays.

140
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,300
So theoretically
you could have a

141
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,500
Sunday night and Monday
without breaking it.

142
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,300
Exactly, you got it.

143
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,600
Here we go.
Hey, good morning.

144
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,800
Can I get the steamed buns...

145
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:15,000
the scalloped
steamed ducklings...

146
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:17,600
and the vegetarian
and shrimp steamed...

147
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:18,900
- Thank you.
- For what?

148
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,600
You know how much I
love the fried stuff.

149
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:22,800
You look after me.

150
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,700
Excellent.
So, what did you say?

151
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,500
- She was hurt,
but you know...

152
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,100
But you where honest, right?

153
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,800
What? I was.
I am. Always.

154
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:33,200
I know you are, but
it's just shocking...

155
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,200
to see how you use
it as a shield.

156
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:37,500
Maybe I should lie.
Be more like Dennis Philips,

157
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,600
and say whatever it takes
to get a woman into bed.

158
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:41,000
No, do not be like
Dennis Philips.

159
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,600
- He's so gross.
- He only hit on you once.

160
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,800
At my father’s funeral.

161
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:48,000
Okay, so he's not known
for his sensitivity.

162
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:51,000
Oh, God.
Anyways...

163
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:54,000
- What?
- Nothing.

164
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:55,700
I know that 'nothing'.
It's not...

165
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:56,500
nothing, it's something.

166
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,700
- 'Anyway'...?
- Anyway we both know,

167
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,500
you don't need to
lie to get a woman...

168
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,000
into bed.

169
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,100
Gloria.

170
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,500
I don't wanna lose that.
Can I keep that? Thank you.

171
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,400
See there's another rule too.
The 24 hour-rule.

172
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,400
I can't call her for another
24 hours.

173
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:11,600
Cause then it appears
that I'm too desperate.

174
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:13,600
You know, Dan sent
me another letter?

175
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:15,700
Asking you to move to Canada
and marry him again?

176
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:19,500
- A slice of apple-crumb pie?
- No, we did that last time.

177
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,400
- You guys broke up
like a year ago.

178
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,000
19 months.

179
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:23,300
- You're counting?

180
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,700
No. He is... It
was in the letter.

181
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,700
Lemon butter cream cup?

182
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,500
Not feeling the
cream cup today.

183
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,100
- Cranberry orange muffin?

184
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,200
Hannah, come on.
You're losing it.

185
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:37,000
- I know, I know... Okay.
- Think about it.

186
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,500
- Come on. You're
disappointing.

187
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,600
I got it, I got it...

188
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,900
- Yeah.
- Wait, I so have it...

189
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,600
Cream cheese sorrel brownie.

190
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,400
You're so good.

191
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,500
What do you think of this?
I think we should get this.

192
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,400
Tom, I am not going to another
one of your fathers weddings.

193
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:02,400
Thank you.
Hannah? Please?

194
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,500
Take one of the girls you've
been rubbing up against.

195
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,400
'No weddings or
family events'.

196
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,500
That's right.
I forgot that rule.

197
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,100
- It gives the
wrong impression.

198
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,200
It does.

199
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,400
- Is this made with
real alligator?

200
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,700
Yes, baby-alligator.

201
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:21,600
- You should be
ashamed of yourself.

202
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:22,900
Look at you.

203
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,600
Hello there...
And who would you be?

204
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:29,700
I love you. Yes I do.
I love you.

205
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,300
You're so pretty. Yes you are.

206
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:34,200
You're beautiful. Yes you
are. Your beautiful face...

207
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:36,700
I love you, love
you, love you.

208
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,900
You should try saying that to
a human sometime.

209
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,400
What?
A human?

210
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,800
To say it to a human?.

211
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,200
You're sweet.
Love you.

212
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:48,900
Hannah, please.
Come to the wedding.

213
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,900
He gets married and
I go. I go because...

214
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,200
he's my father and I
care deeply for the man.

215
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:54,900
And everybody knows
he doesn't love...

216
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,200
them, and they don't love him.

217
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:58,000
It's pathetic, it
breaks my heart.

218
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:59,300
I don't know what to say.

219
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,800
You know when someone's
making a mistake...

220
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:02,100
and it's not your
place to interfere.

221
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,300
You simply say:
'I'm happy you're happy'.

222
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,100
- I'm happy you're happy.
- Yeah.

223
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,300
Okay. I'll do that.

224
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,700
I promise you, this is the...

225
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,400
last time I'll
ask you to come.

226
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,200
And then I'll find
somebody else...

227
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,600
to come to the next funeral.

228
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:18,100
Hannah, please.

229
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,900
That's cute.

230
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:27,300
- Last time.
- Thank you. Thank you.

231
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,900
She gets the
apartment in the city,

232
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
and 30 grand a month.

233
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:44,100
Right.
Right, okay.

234
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,400
You get the house in
the Hamptons, she's...

235
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,700
asking for the
apartment in the city,

236
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,500
and 30 grand a month.
- Thirty? But...

237
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,300
Are you still negotiating
a pre-nup?

238
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,700
Now the party starts...
My son is here.

239
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,400
Dad, you’re getting
married in 10 minutes.

240
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,300
Dad, please, I can't breathe.

241
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,100
- Did you bring
the lovely Hannah?

242
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,200
Yes, I did.

243
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,300
You know, if you
don't act on that...

244
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,500
pretty soon, you know
what I'm gonna do?

245
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,600
- No.

246
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:05,000
I'm gonna make
her my number 6.

247
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:08,700
Seven...
This is number 6.

248
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:12,000
- Yeah.
- My God, you are pretty.

249
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,500
Dad.

250
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,600
- I used to be
that pretty once.

251
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,800
Dennis, look how
pretty my boy is.

252
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,400
Yeah, he's beautiful.
They won't...

253
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,900
accept a minimum
of 5 times a week.

254
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,700
- She promised 5, I want 5.

255
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,300
What did she promise
you, 5 times a week?

256
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,400
- 4 times?
- Two.

257
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,900
No, no...
We're not done yet.

258
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,000
- She says 3, with
a bi-monthly BJ.

259
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,300
This is disturbing.

260
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,900
4 and make it weekly.

261
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,700
Wait, no... Driver
go around the block.

262
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,500
We are not even close...

263
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,600
What was that?

264
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:47,500
Come on.
Come on, tell me.

265
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,200
- Say what you gotta say.
- I'm happy, If you're happy.

266
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:52,600
No, no...'You're
too old for her dad'.

267
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:55,200
'She doesn't love you,
this is embarrassing'.

268
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:56,700
'You're gonna rack up
your fifth divorce'.

269
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,800
- Sixth.
- Sixth.

270
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,700
- I'm happy, if you're happy.
- Bullshit.

271
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,700
Go for 4 if you exercise more.

272
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,700
She says you can't gain
any more weight.

273
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,100
- Take it. Deal.
- Deal.

274
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,300
I told her I weigh 10 pounds
more than I do.

275
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,900
- Ain't love grand?
- Sign the both please.

276
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
What's he signing now?

277
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:16,300
His current pre-nup and
his last divorce-papers.

278
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,400
That's just great...

279
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,200
Your good. Thank you.

280
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,500
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

281
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,600
- Did you tell your
dad you love him?

282
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:11,900
I told him I cared for him.

283
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,600
You can't even
tell your father.

284
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:16,000
- I don't get that.
- It's a 'Guy thing'.

285
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:19,100
No, it's a 'Tom thing'.

286
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:22,900
- You're an 'I love you-slut'.
- Are you kidding me?

287
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,800
You say it all the time.
To everybody.

288
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,000
- Oh, this looks so good.

289
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:28,500
Yeah, it looks
good doesn't it?

290
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:32,200
I should have ordered
this. this look good.

291
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:35,200
You always order
better than I do.

292
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,200
It's lemon, right? It's good.
I'm ordering that from now on.

293
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:40,400
- No, you won't.
- Why?

294
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,400
I need you to order
the chocolate cake...

295
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,400
so I can have some.

296
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:46,700
- There's my 'son'.
- There you go...

297
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:51,600
Oh, you're bad boy
I'm gonna spank you.

298
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:55,700
You know what I would like
to say to you? Is that...

299
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,600
- I want you to
listen to me, Tom.

300
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:58,700
Yeah.

301
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,900
If you need any advice...

302
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,600
- or you need any advice...
- Right.

303
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:07,100
Or you got girl problems,
I don't know...

304
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,100
I need you to think
of me how you...

305
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,500
would a real mother.

306
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,100
- Yeah that's
exactly what I...

307
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,600
Look at this beauty, will you?

308
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,700
Hello, Sweety

309
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:20,300
Drunk as the night I first
met her.

310
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:25,300
- You are a bad
influence on her.

311
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,400
Me?

312
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,500
- Last shot?
- Thanks.

313
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:32,000
- I'm stealing you away...
- Last one...

314
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:35,900
- He does know that he
can just date, right?

315
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,200
No, I don't think he does.

316
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:41,200
- To mothers.
- To mothers. Cheers.

317
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,800
Careful.

318
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,400
Nice...

319
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:59,600
Oh God...

320
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:00,800
Hide me.

321
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:01,900
- What?

322
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,600
It's my dad’s
patient coordinator.

323
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:04,900
Yeah, don't look,
don't look...

324
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:05,800
There... Don't look.

325
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,500
She's obsessed with me.

326
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,400
She's created a website called
'allthingstom. org'.

327
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,600
- A Psycho blogger?
- Yes.

328
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,700
Okay. Come on...
Dance with me.

329
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,300
- Watch yourself.
- She's kind of cute.

330
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,800
- Oh stop it.
- I'm serious...

331
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:19,900
Keep going.

332
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:25,300
Here. Right here. Hide me.
back side, side. Go, go...

333
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,700
The last blog was a
2 page description...

334
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:31,800
of my face.

335
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,900
See, she doesn't think
my nose is too...

336
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,500
bent or my lips are too thin.

337
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,700
- Who said that?
- You did. When we met.

338
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,800
- Well, I lied.
- What?

339
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:45,800
- I thought you were hot.
- Really?

340
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,100
Well, you told me I looked
like a dog.

341
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,500
That was just cause I was
trying to sleep with you.

342
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,600
Why haven't you since?

343
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:57,000
Well... I like having you
in my life.

344
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:59,200
- ...
- Hi, Tom.

345
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:01,000
- Oh, hi.
- Did you see the new blog?

346
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:03,100
No, we haven't.

347
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,800
- Who's this?
- This? This is my girlfriend.

348
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,800
Why didn't you tell me you
we’re seeing someone?

349
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:10,900
Because I don't know you.

350
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,600
But we have a really, really
open relationship...

351
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:14,000
- Really?

352
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,400
You know? I wanted to
talk to you about that,

353
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,100
- princess.
- Princess?

354
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,600
I... I don't wanna be with
anybody but you.

355
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:20,900
I don't know if
I’m really quite...

356
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,100
ready to make that
commitment...

357
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,900
- Are you?
- You know my rules...

358
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
- I'm bit of an
emotional retard.

359
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,100
Yeah...

360
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:31,600
I think I need to
start a new blog now.

361
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:33,700
- That is so scary.

362
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,900
She's psychotic on top of P..

363
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Oh, this is not good.

364
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,400
- Saia da minha frente.
- Ei.

365
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:52,800
Okay, good... She's gone.
Perfect. Let's go.

366
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,900
Good, come on.
What?

367
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:00,100
Do you remember that ancestral
home in Scotland,

368
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,900
with those amazing paintings
I told you about?

369
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,700
- It's all I think about.
- Stop it, Tom.

370
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,200
I finally got the board to
sign of...

371
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:08,200
on making editions to a
permanent collection.

372
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:09,700
Really?

373
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,300
But they want me to go to

374
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,200
Scotland for an
aquisitionship.

375
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:15,000
- When are you going?
- A couple of days.

376
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:17,100
- Couple of days?
For how long?

377
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,200
Six weeks.

378
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,300
That's a long time.

379
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:23,500
- That's great.
- You think?

380
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,400
Yes, it's a great opportunity
for you.

381
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:30,000
You're like the
'museum maiden of the Met'.

382
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,400
It's got a good ring to it...

383
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,900
- Thank you.
- Congratulations.

384
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:41,300
Six Sundays.

385
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,600
- That is six Sundays.

386
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,800
What am I gonna
do without you?

387
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:49,000
I can just imagine.

388
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,700
- Yeah...
- What are you doing?

389
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,000
- I'm gonna jump.
- No, no.

390
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:54,400
- I'm gonna jump.
- Jesus.

391
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,700
Six Sundays,
how can I live without you?

392
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,900
Can you not take
anything seriously?

393
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,200
- Yeah, I can.
- Get down.

394
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:03,200
- Let's get you another drink.

395
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:05,300
I think I've had
too many already.

396
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,200
- Thanks for coming
to the wedding.

397
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:07,900
It was a ball,

398
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,800
- I can't wait
for number seven.

399
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:12,000
It's coming up soon,
I have a feeling.

400
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:13,700
We also ask at this time that...

401
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,900
you turn off all your
electronic devices.

402
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,200
Please leave your
cell phones turned...

403
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,200
off for the duration
of the flight.

404
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:38,900
- I'm not gonna be able
to play today, man.

405
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,100
If we don't have a
fourth, we are gonna...

406
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,300
end up playing with
'Tiny-Shorts Guy'.

407
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,600
- So?
- Hey, how's it going?

408
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,200
- Need another?
- No, our friend Paul,

409
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:45,900
- with longer
shorts, is coming.

410
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:46,300
Right.

411
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,900
No, Jenny signed him up
for some art walk thing...

412
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,700
Art walk? Are you serious?
Tell me something.

413
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,200
What do you think Jenny
did with his balls...

414
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:53,000
when she cut them off?

415
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:54,800
Come on, guys,
marriage isn't that bad.

416
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:56,800
I agree. Without marriage
there would be no divorce,

417
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:59,300
and without divorce I wouldn't
have my condo in Aspen.

418
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,400
Bingo.

419
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,100
- Good one.
- What is he?

420
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,200
I'm serious, man.

421
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:06,500
Your missing out on
the best parts of life.

422
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,000
- The most important
part of life.

423
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:09,700
This coming from the
guy who's wife...

424
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,300
won't let him own porn.
He's gotta wank off...

425
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,800
to the underwear section
of the Sears catalogue.

426
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:15,800
I thought we weren't
gonna talk...

427
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:16,500
about that?

428
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,600
What's the matter with you?

429
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,100
You are single and
you've been single,

430
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,400
ever since...
What was her name?

431
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:21,600
- Sophomore year.

432
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:24,100
Plim... Pimpkin,
Pimpkin, that's it.

433
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,000
Pimpkin dumped you for him.

434
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:27,700
Sophomore year, you've
never been the same...

435
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:28,800
you haven't been
able to sleep.

436
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:29,900
- Scarred...

437
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,500
Yeah. You have no
idea, how nice it is...

438
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,400
to have someone who
is gonna be there,

439
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:35,700
no matter what, whatever.

440
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:36,600
- Snaps to that.

441
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:38,400
And you don't know
how nice it is...

442
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,500
to sleep with a different
girl every night.

443
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:43,400
- That's true.
- Nice recital.

444
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,600
You got the best of
both worlds, Tom.

445
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:47,300
No, it's true.

446
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,800
I can sleep with
whoever I want.

447
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,500
But I still get to hang
out with Hannah afterwards.

448
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:51,400
- Perfect setup.

449
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,100
Yeah, well maybe
not for Hannah...

450
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,700
- What's that
supposed to mean?

451
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,100
Come on, Tom. She's a woman.

452
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,400
Yeah, I got that.

453
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:58,500
- You sure?
- Yeah.

454
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:01,600
Tom, she's pushing 30.
You think her idea of...

455
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:04,000
'Happily ever after' is
coming home to you...

456
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:06,200
and hanging out after
you got laid?

457
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:09,000
- Makes you think, right?
- Yeah.

458
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,100
- Hallo?
- Hey.

459
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:21,500
- Hi.

460
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,400
How's the weather in England?

461
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:26,700
It's great.
Only I'm in Scotland.

462
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:31,300
Right, right.
So it's sunny?

463
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:36,700
It's 3 in the morning.
- Oh, right. Sorry.

464
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,800
- So it's dark.
- Yeah.

465
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:41,900
Have you seen the
Loch Ness Monster?

466
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,900
- I know, terrible joke...

467
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,600
Was there something important?

468
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:47,500
Yeah. You'll
never guess what happened.

469
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,600
- What?
- They filled in the pot hole.

470
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:52,500
- The pot hole?
- On 83rd.

471
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,700
- Terrific... Hey, Tom?.
- Yeah?

472
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,800
- I'm gonna go
back to sleep now.

473
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:58,900
Ok. Sure.

474
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,800
Love you.

475
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:03,500
Good night...
Call me tomorrow.

476
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:17,700
- This stuff's all old...
- Yeah, that's the point.

477
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,700
- Let's go to Fendi...
- Fendi? No.

478
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:22,500
We're here,
let's just stay here.

479
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,400
I'm not into old stuff.

480
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,200
Why do you talk like
a six-year-old?

481
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:28,300
I'm not.

482
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,000
The line is too long...

483
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:33,800
- Can't we just go
somewhere else?

484
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:34,000
No.

485
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:35,900
This is the best
bakery in the world.

486
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,900
That's why it's worth
waiting in line.

487
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Come on.
We'll play a game.

488
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:42,000
- Wanna play a game?
- Yeah, I can play a game.

489
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:43,400
Okay. Good.

490
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:46,000
- Tell me what to order.
- Why?

491
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:49,900
You'll see. It will be fun.
Make a suggestion.

492
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,300
- A cookie.
- No, you have to be specific,

493
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,700
like what type of cookie...

494
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,200
A really big cookie.

495
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:09,500
Tom, your phone's ringing...

496
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,600
Hallo. Hallo?

497
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,800
Hallo...

498
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:23,300
- What's wrong?
- Just an important call.

499
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:26,800
That's because you are
an important person.

500
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:30,200
Wait. Hey...

501
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:31,600
We will have...

502
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:34,500
2 fried dumplings,
2 of the wantons...

503
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:37,300
and 6 of the fried
'pork-thingies'.

504
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,700
- Yeah. But that's
fried. It's not healthy.

505
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,900
Oh, come on. Have
some of the fried...

506
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
It won't hurt you.

507
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:46,700
Thank you.

508
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:49,500
Move, please..

509
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:52,100
God.

510
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:54,300
This is unbelievable.

511
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:56,400
- Hallo?
- Hey, hallo?

512
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:59,000
- Hallo?
- Hannah?

513
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,800
- Hallo?
- Hey.

514
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:03,800
Tom?
Tom is that you?

515
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:05,900
- Tom?
- Hallo?

516
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,500
Hallo? You're cutting out,

517
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,700
I can't hear anything
you're saying.

518
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:12,200
Tom? I'm stuck in a
thunderstorm.

519
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:14,800
I'm surrounded by a world
of cows.

520
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:16,600
- I'll call you when
I get to the hotel...

521
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:17,400
I can't hear you.

522
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:19,500
Tom?

523
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,200
Hallo.

524
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,800
Hallo. Hallo?

525
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,400
Hallo?

526
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
I hate Scotland.

527
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:20,200
- Having a hard time?
- We're having a hard time...

528
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:23,500
- Oh yeah? Want a hand?
- Thank you, sir.

529
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,000
- Yeah.
- We would love it.

530
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:27,600
- You'd better sit down, sir.
- ...

531
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:29,600
- Sit down.
- Sit, sit, sit.

532
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:31,700
Here we go.

533
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:34,300
- Thank you.
- No, no, thank you.

534
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,200
- Thank you.
- Have a good afternoon.

535
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:38,300
You were wonderful.

536
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,400
- Desista enquanto pode.
- Here we go.

537
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:57,400
- Come on, Scott.
- Let's go.

538
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:58,300
What you got, Gar?

539
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,200
What you got, Gar?
What do you got?

540
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:03,200
- Come on.
- What do you got, Gary?

541
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Foul. Foul, Tom.

542
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,000
What the matter
with you today?

543
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:11,100
Ahh... I think I might have
feelings for Hannah.

544
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:15,800
Come on, come on...
Let's just play.

545
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:18,100
It's just...

546
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:20,100
Without her, something’s off,

547
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,500
and it's got me
thinking that maybe...

548
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:25,500
there's more to life than
just sleeping around.

549
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,900
- I don't understand...
- I'm not following...

550
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,600
Come on, let's just play.
Come on.

551
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:32,700
- I'll take it out.

552
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,600
I know exactly what
you mean, Tom.

553
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:37,000
Thanks. Here you go.

554
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,500
I'm gonna tell Hannah.
When she gets home.

555
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,300
I'm gonna tell her that
i wanna be with her,

556
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,600
not marriage,
just be together.

557
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:44,700
Yeah, that's romantic...

558
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:50,000
>You have one unheard
message<

559
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:54,100
Hey, Tom. I'm back.
God, I cannot wait to see you.

560
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,300
I don't care what you're
doing tonight, cancel it.

561
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,600
We're going to dinner.

562
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:59,000
Meet me at that new
trendy place,

563
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:00,700
next to the small
Greek place we hated,

564
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,700
that used to be the
Thai-fusion place we loved.

565
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:07,200
Meet me there 8 o'clock,
I have so much to tell you.

566
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:20,600
- Hey, what have you got?

567
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:22,200
Hey Buddy. I'll
find you something.

568
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:24,300
Alright...

569
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,700
Here's something.
How many do you want?

570
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:29,900
- I'll take the yellow ones.
- Good choice. Ten bucks.

571
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

572
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,500
- Have a good night.
- I will.

573
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,800
- Sorry, is she already here?
- Over there.

574
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:46,900
Yeah, thanks.

575
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:21,100
Oh, God.

576
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,900
- Tom, are you okay?

577
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,900
I'm alright. Are you alright?

578
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,400
I think I have a broken rib.

579
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:27,200
- Your flowers, sir.

580
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:28,600
They're not mine.
I'm fine, I'm okay..

581
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:30,000
- I'm okay.
- Are you okay?

582
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:32,000
- I'm so sorry.
- You alright?

583
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:34,100
- Here are your flowers.
- What, what...

584
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,800
- You had flowers?
- They're not my flowers.

585
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,900
- They're your flowers.
- I didn't have flowers.

586
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,300
- Hi. It's so good to see you.
- I've missed you.

587
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,400
- Great.

588
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:43,300
Come here, there's someone
I want you to meet.

589
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,900
Oh good.

590
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
It started pouring
and suddenly it...

591
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:48,700
was just me in
a field of cows.

592
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,100
And, of course we're in Europe...

593
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,700
so there's no street
signs anywhere...

594
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:52,500
- and it's getting dark...

595
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,600
And then she thought
she was in...

596
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:58,200
some bad werewolf movie.
'Stay off the moors, Lassie'.

597
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:02,000
Anyway... all of the
sudden, out of nowhere.

598
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:04,300
Colin comes riding
up on horseback.

599
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,000
- Can you believe it? A horse.
- Oh...

600
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:07,900
He asked me if I
needed any help.

601
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,200
You were a 'Lady in distress',
what was I supposed to do?

602
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:13,300
It was right out
of a Bronte-novel.

603
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,400
So anyway... He shows me
to this charming little Inn.

604
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,000
Were he proceeds to buy me...

605
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:20,800
the most awful dinner
I've ever had.

606
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:25,000
It was pretty bad,
even by Scottish standards.

607
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:26,600
Then we just spend the next...

608
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:27,900
month travelling
around the country,

609
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,600
getting to know each other,
visiting museums... It was..

610
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:34,700
- Perfect.
- Perfect.

611
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:43,500
So... When it was time for
Hannah to leave, I just...

612
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:46,900
I don't know, I just...
Couldn't let her go.

613
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,700
- So I got down on one knee...

614
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,700
And he proposed.
And I accepted.

615
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,500
- Wow. That's
just... Huge, it's...

616
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,800
So the wedding's coming
together very quickly.

617
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:55,500
- Sounds like it.

618
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,000
We're gonna be
married in Scotland,

619
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:58,100
- At Colin's
parents summer home.

620
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,300
It's gonna be a
pretty small thing.

621
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,400
We can't expect
too many people...

622
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:04,000
making the trip over
sea, just for a night.

623
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:05,400
- The Fourth?
- Right.

624
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,400
- That's two weeks.
- It's crazy, isn't it?

625
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:08,800
- Have you ever been
to Scotland, Tom?

626
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:09,600
You know, I haven't.

627
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:11,800
- You should see the wee
church we're gonna have.

628
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:14,100
It's the same one Colin's
parent's were married in.

629
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,900
It's pretty spectacular,
just a walk...

630
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:16,700
from my distillery.

631
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:17,300
- Distillery?

632
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,700
Colin's family owns
the largest...

633
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:21,600
whiskey distillery in
Scotland.

634
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:24,500
Tom.. Look, If you're
getting married

635
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,900
I expect to be
your 'Best Man'.

636
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:31,500
Tom... Will you be my
'Maid of Honor'?

637
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,800
Your 'Maid of Honor'?

638
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:40,900
Sorry.

639
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:46,700
What is it with you, man?
I didn't...

640
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:50,500
Excuse me... Excuse me.
Did you see that?

641
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:54,700
'Made of Honor'?

642
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:57,200
That's fun stuff.
But you're a guy.

643
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:59,500
Go ahead...
Just get it out.

644
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,700
So, what did you say?

645
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,200
- Did you say yes?
- No.

646
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:03,400
- No?

647
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:05,200
I didn't know what to say. I
told her I'd think about it.

648
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:06,900
You need to think
about whether your...

649
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,500
dress is gonna make
your ass look big.

650
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:11,300
- Give me a break, come on.
- Okay. Alright, let me think.

651
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,500
- Is she really
in to this guy?

652
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:13,500
You should have seen them.

653
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,900
Staring at him all moony
like he shits unicorns.

654
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:16,600
That's not good, man.

655
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:18,200
I'm thinking you're
gonna have to do this.

656
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:19,600
You're gonna have to be
the Maid of Honor.

657
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:20,000
- What?

658
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:21,900
Yeah, I'm serious.
Think about it,

659
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,500
this will give you
an excuse to be...

660
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:24,600
around Hannah all the time.

661
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:26,400
Helping her out, being...

662
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:28,600
'the man behind
the curtain'...

663
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:30,700
You'll be her confident.

664
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,200
And you can use that
time to point...

665
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:33,800
out to Hannah that
this is really crazy.

666
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:35,900
- And that she doesn't
even know this guy at all.

667
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,400
No, I'm not gonna
do that. No way.

668
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:38,700
- What?
- No.

669
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:42,700
Look, I don't know what your
other options are.

670
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:44,300
You got a better
chance of stopping...

671
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:44,900
this wedding,

672
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,200
from 'inside'
than from another continent.

673
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:49,200
And they say that you can...

674
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:52,400
shorten this and wear
it again, if you like.

675
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:54,400
Come on man. If you're
serious and you...

676
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,200
really want Hanna
back from this guy.

677
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:59,100
You're gonna have to
do whatever it takes.

678
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,500
Whatever.

679
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:15,400
- The dress is beautiful.
- Thank you.

680
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:18,400
- I am so happy
you're gonna do this.

681
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:19,500
My pleasure.

682
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:22,100
For this wedding, I am willing
to do whatever it takes.

683
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:24,100
- I'm so excited.
- Yeah, me too.

684
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:25,200
So let me tell you who the...

685
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:26,300
other bridesmaids
are gonna be.

686
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,500
- Okay.
- Okay. Stephanie...

687
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,300
- Stephanie, great.
- And she loves you.

688
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:29,600
- Good.

689
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:30,900
And my friend
Hillary, from camp.

690
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Hillary, I don't know Hillary.

691
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:34,100
- She's the best
- Okay.

692
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:36,100
- And Melissa.
- Oh, no.

693
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:37,800
- I had to, Tom,
she's my cousin.

694
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:38,700
No, she hates me.

695
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:41,300
- Well, you broke her heart.
- She broke my nose.

696
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,600
- It was an accident.
- She hit me with her fist.

697
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:44,800
I was completely
honest with her.

698
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:45,900
I said: 'Look,
nothing serious'.

699
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
And she agreed.

700
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:50,100
So sometimes our hearts don't
match our mouths.

701
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:51,400
That's good, you should
put that in your vows.

702
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:52,900
And, she's been
wanting to be my...

703
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,700
maid of honor since
we were 5 years old,

704
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,700
so now she's really gonna
hate you.

705
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,000
Here they are now.

706
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:00,800
Okay. Well as your
Maid of Honor.

707
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:03,300
I promise to keep the peace.

708
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,700
Oh, hi.

709
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,400
Yes. The bride to be.

710
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,100
- Hello, you must be Tom.
- And you must be Hillary.

711
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,200
You look gorgeous.

712
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:26,900
Stephanie, how are you doing?
So good to see you.

713
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
- Are you kidding.
- It's you, Melissa.

714
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:31,400
Look at that...

715
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,900
- This was great.
- This isn't awkward...

716
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,100
Go on.
I'm gonna be fine.

717
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:49,700
- Tom, have you met Colin yet?
- Yes.

718
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:53,400
- Isn't he dreamy?
- Absolutely.

719
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:57,600
Could someone please pass
me the Splendor?

720
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:00,900
Could someone who's
not a misogynist,

721
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
please pass the Splenda?

722
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,000
- Hallo?
- Thank you, Stephanie.

723
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:09,100
It's Colin, you guys.

724
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:14,400
Hi, babe.
Just a sec... Hi.

725
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:17,400
So cute.

726
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
We only have 9 days before
we leave for Scotland,

727
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:22,600
- so we have to act quickly.
- Exactly.

728
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:24,800
I've been a 'MOH' 6 times,
so I'll organize everything...

729
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:26,700
that needs to be
done, even though

730
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,500
I'm not officially
the 'MOH' here.

731
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:31,300
- What is a 'MOH'?
- M-O-H.

732
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,500
Maid Of Honor.

733
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:34,800
- Yes.
- Oh, yes. That's clever.

734
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:38,500
No, it's going great.
Very smoothly.

735
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:42,600
So we got the bridal shower
bachelorette, dress fittings,

736
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:43,900
- The 'kilt'...
- I'll do the 'kilt'.

737
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
- Okay... perfect.
- Okay.

738
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:47,500
Shopping for Hannah's
true self...

739
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,000
- That's gonna be great.

740
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:51,000
So, what is
Hannah's true self?

741
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:54,100
It's lingerie. For her
wedding night.

742
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,700
How do you expect to be a good...

743
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,300
'MOH' if you don't
even know that.

744
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,900
- She's talking to me.
- No, I didn't..

745
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,200
- You just did.
- Oh, I'm sorry, Tom.

746
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:05,500
Did I break a rule?

747
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:07,900
How about we focus on the
wedding part?

748
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,100
- Good idea.
- Just for now...

749
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,700
Okay, I need, dress sizes.

750
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,500
- I'm a four.
- Okay.

751
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:15,800
- Eight.
- Sorry?.

752
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,200
You know, Hillary...

753
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:21,900
Do you think that maybe
you'd just be more...

754
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,600
- comfortable in
like a, twelve?

755
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:26,300
No, it will be fine.

756
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,000
- I'm doing the
Dr. Riverbed fast.

757
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:29,100
Oh, yeah.

758
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,600
- Yeah.
- What is that?

759
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:33,200
Water, peach raisin/apple
pectin /shark extract.

760
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:35,500
And Lowry's Seasoning Salt.

761
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,800
- What about food?
- Look.

762
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:40,100
I'm going to look
amazing in that dress.

763
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,400
I am going to meet a
Scottish man, and...

764
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:46,000
I'm gonna be happy.
Write down an eight.

765
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:47,200
Got it.

766
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:49,600
What's your dress size,
Made Of Honor?

767
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:52,000
I don't know. What's your jock
size, Melissa?

768
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:54,100
That's enough. Enough.

769
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:57,800
Sorry. But will you guys
look at Hannah, please.

770
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,900
She's happy, finally.

771
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:02,700
So please, for Hannah,
let's all just get along,

772
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,100
put a smile on our faces...

773
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,700
and pretend
everything's perfect.

774
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:08,400
- Here she comes.
- Okay. Fine.

775
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:14,500
- What did he say?
- He's so sweet.

776
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:18,300
Isn't that great?

777
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:19,600
How's it going?

778
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:23,600
- Good, really good.
- Fantastic.

779
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:26,500
- And it's pretty much done.
- Perfect, really?

780
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,600
- Tom.
- Yes?

781
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,800
- Here.
- What is this?

782
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,300
She does bridal
shower entertainment.

783
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,900
And I hired her for
Stephanie's sisters shower,

784
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,900
and Hannah loved it.
She reads Tarot...

785
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:36,800
cards and stuff.

786
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:38,300
That's great.
Thank you, Melissa.

787
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,500
I'm not doing it for you,
I'm doing it for Hannah.

788
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:43,800
Okay.
Thank you, for Hannah.

789
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:45,000
It should have been me...

790
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:46,000
- I'll talk with you tomorrow.
- Okay.

791
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:47,300
- Bye, Tom.
- Goodbye.

792
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,800
- Bye, Hillary.
- Nice meeting you.

793
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:49,900
You too, bye.

794
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,500
I just had a very nice
bonding moment with Melissa.

795
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:54,400
- Can I ask you a favor?
- Sure.

796
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:57,300
My mother and grandmother are
coming in to town tomorrow.

797
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,700
And I have so much to plan...

798
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,800
I was wondering if you
and the boys could...

799
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:02,100
entertain Colin for the day.

800
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:02,800
- Entertain him?

801
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:04,600
Yeah, just kind of get
to know him and stuff.

802
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:06,700
- Sure.
- Cool.

803
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:11,700
So are you more proud of
'Scotch Tape' or McDonald's?

804
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,700
I think they're both American.

805
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,900
- So wait, you invited this
guy to play ball with us?

806
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,100
Yeah, he's the competition.

807
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:19,300
I need to get to know his
strengths and weaknesses.

808
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,700
I like his green shirts.

809
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,900
Is that like a poly
blend kind of thing?

810
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,100
Yeah, it's my shirt...

811
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,300
- It's your shirt?
- Yeah.

812
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,900
- Looks good on him, huh?
- Yeah, real good.

813
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,100
Why don't you play with him?

814
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,800
Thanks.

815
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:32,700
Colin, have you ever played
basketball before?

816
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,200
We would call this 'netball',

817
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:36,500
back in Scotland, it's
more of a woman's game,

818
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:38,900
so, no I don't have much
experience.

819
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,700
- Hi, I do. Need one more?
- We're good.

820
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,500
Alright.

821
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:47,600
- Alright, 'girls', you ready?
- Yeah, I am.

822
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:49,000
Oh.
Use your hands.

823
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:52,200
- You alright there?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

824
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:54,000
- I'm open. I'm open.
- Here we go.

825
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:56,800
You gotta hold on
to the ball, man.

826
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:58,500
Hold on to the ball.

827
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:01,300
Homos. Homos.
Homos.

828
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:03,300
Let's get the Scottish girl
out if the tree.

829
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,600
You wanna start a game cause
you didn't get that.

830
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:07,200
There you go.
Open. Open.

831
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:08,700
Here you go. That was good.
Good.

832
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,300
Good.
Amiga.

833
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,400
Shoot it. Guys.

834
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,300
- I like it.
- I'm sorry.

835
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:18,100
- Come on.
- Get on the path.

836
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,900
You ok?

837
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Ok, basket.

838
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:28,100
Put it in the basket.
Put it in the basket.

839
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:29,900
- You know what I'm learning?
The guy's a chump.

840
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,500
Yeah.

841
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:34,200
- Wow, 'Fault'.
- There it is. That's it.

842
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:36,200
That's it. That's it.
We got it now.

843
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:38,000
Hey, I look good now, don't I?

844
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:40,100
Here we go.

845
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:44,000
Put it in the basket.

846
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:47,300
- In the basket.
- Take a shot, chief.

847
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,800
- Sorry, guys.
- Did you see that?

848
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:55,900
Probably not allowed to just
stuff it in like that.

849
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,400
- He dunks the ball.
- Sorry. Sorry.

850
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:59,700
He dunks the ball...

851
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:02,200
That was awesome.
You can dunk.

852
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:04,600
He can dunk. That is awesome.

853
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:06,400
If that's allowed, why
don't you guys all do it?

854
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:09,200
If we could, we would.
Right?

855
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,300
- Play?
- Guys.

856
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
- No.
- Yeah.

857
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:27,300
- Score.
- Yeah.

858
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:35,400
- Yes.
- Good game, yeah, good game.

859
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:36,900
My brother.

860
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,900
- Looks like you're
getting more competition..

861
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:39,700
I know, I know...

862
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:42,300
I love this guy.

863
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,100
Shit.

864
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:00,900
- You alright?
- Yeah.

865
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
What happening?

866
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:06,700
My boy's got mad cow disease.

867
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,000
We have got to get some dirt
on this guy.

868
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:11,900
I got a guy I use
when a spouse...

869
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
suspect infidelity.

870
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:14,900
Everybody's got
skeletons in the closet.

871
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Nobody is squeaky-clean,

872
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:17,100
- and my guy's the best.

873
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,700
I don't know, it
just seems so cheap.

874
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,300
Don't worry, I'll
charge you double...

875
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:21,200
because you're rich.

876
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:22,800
I mean, it's a
cheap thing to do.

877
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:24,500
- He play's cheap,
you gotta match that.

878
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:25,600
How does Colin play cheep?

879
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:27,800
That whole thing with
Hannah, being Scottish.

880
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:29,900
Making her fall in love
with him in Scotland.

881
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,100
That 'monster thing' of his.

882
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:35,900
Fine.
Get the dirt.

883
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:41,500
That's cool.

884
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:45,200
Van Wyck Expressway
Kennedy Airport 1.5 mile

885
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:56,600
What's he gonna do,
eat her?

886
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:00,900
Come on, come on.
Take a breath. Take a...

887
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:08,300
Thanks, Tom.

888
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:12,700
- Yeah, have a great flight.
- Right. Thanks, mate.

889
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,400
Come on...

890
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:21,800
- I love you, Colin.
- Bye.

891
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:23,900
Bye.

892
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:31,600
- Yeah...
- My God.

893
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:35,000
- Need some chap stick?
- Yeah...

894
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:36,900
So... What church should
we go to?

895
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
Grace's Church.

896
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:50,600
Thank you so much for coming
with me to meet the reverend.

897
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:52,800
- No problem.
- He is the sweetest man...

898
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:53,900
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

899
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,900
He married my parents
and insisted...

900
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
on coming to Scotland
to do my wedding.

901
00:43:58,100 --> 00:44:00,200
Why didn't Colin stay and do
this with you?

902
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:01,400
It was more important for him...

903
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:02,800
to go back to
Scotland to partition

904
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:03,800
The Grand Council...

905
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:05,400
so Colin and I
could get married.

906
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:07,300
I don't know. Grand?
What does that mean?

907
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:09,700
I'm not Scottish
and his family...

908
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:10,800
is kind of...

909
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:11,800
What?

910
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:13,600
Royalty.

911
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:15,500
Royalty?

912
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:20,000
- Royalty? Is he like a King?
- No.. No, he's a Duke.

913
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:24,700
A Duke?

914
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,000
- Hannah, darling.
- Reverend Foote.

915
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:35,600
And this must be the
lucky young man...

916
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:37,400
who is marrying our
beautiful Hannah.

917
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:38,700
Oh, no.

918
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:40,100
- I'm not marrying him
- No...

919
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:42,900
This is Tom,
my 'Maid Of Honor'.

920
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:45,800
- Maid of Honor?
- Yes.

921
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:47,700
How about that...

922
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:52,000
We have many gay and lesbian
members of the congregation.

923
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:54,100
Welcome.

924
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:05,600
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Reverend.

925
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:11,700
So...

926
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:13,400
- Let's talk
about the wedding.

927
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:13,800
Okay.

928
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:16,500
I need to get some details
about you and...

929
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:18,600
- Colin.
- Colin, yes.

930
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,100
I want to work it
in to the ceremony.

931
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:24,000
Okay. It was such a
whirl wind. Really...

932
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:27,100
Yes, enlighten me.
Tell me about it.

933
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:30,900
Hannah, darling.

934
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,500
Hannah, I think it's important...

935
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:34,000
to dig deep her
for the vows...

936
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:36,700
and tell the Reverend all
you know about Colin.

937
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:38,600
- All that you love about him.
- Okay.

938
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:39,700
And not just the
obvious stuff,

939
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:41,700
but those unique
characteristics...

940
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:42,800
that are Colin.

941
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:47,600
Those things that make you
laugh and say...

942
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:49,700
'That's so Colin'.

943
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:52,600
Right...

944
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:55,100
And then, maybe you
could get some...

945
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:56,800
information from Colin...

946
00:45:56,900 --> 00:45:59,300
and emphasize
their unique bond,

947
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:01,000
their shared history.

948
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:03,100
Off course.

949
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:05,700
We could talk about
love at first sight.

950
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:08,800
Well, that's always a
crowd pleaser, but...

951
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:10,700
Hannah... Elaborate...

952
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:14,800
Tell me more about him.
How you feel about him.

953
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:22,100
Where did you meet?

954
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:24,700
- In Scotland...
- Modigliani.

955
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,200
Your first summer
in New York City,

956
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:27,900
you were dating a guy who
worked on Wall Street...

957
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,100
and he asked you to move in...

958
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:30,500
with him and you
weren't quite sure...

959
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:31,700
And it was right
around that time...

960
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:32,900
that you 'discovered'
Modigliani...

961
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,800
And became obsessed
with this painting...

962
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:38,500
of this woman who had this
blue scarf on, holding a baby.

963
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:39,400
And Hannah said: 'That...

964
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:40,500
painting captured
the essence...

965
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:42,800
of that woman better
than any photograph'.

966
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:45,100
I can't believe you
can remember that.

967
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:46,300
I also remembered that she...

968
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:48,000
freaked, because she
said she felt more...

969
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:49,500
passionate about that painting...

970
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:51,100
than she did but
'Mr. Wall Street'...

971
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:52,800
And she wondered if she could
ever meet somebody...

972
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:54,400
that could make her feel this...

973
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:56,000
passionate as
that work of art.

974
00:46:56,100 --> 00:46:58,100
That's good.

975
00:46:58,100 --> 00:46:59,800
That's good.

976
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:01,800
Modigliani.

977
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:04,900
Now I know why you picked
him to be 'Maid of Honor'.

978
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
Yes...

979
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:10,600
Come on. Who's ready
to lose some...

980
00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:12,500
money tonight. Because
I'm feeling lucky.

981
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:13,600
You guys are late.
How you doing?

982
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:14,600
- How you holding up, champ?
- Stressed.

983
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:16,700
What the hell is this?

984
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:18,400
- Hannah's shower's
in the morning.

985
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:19,400
Well where are we gonna play?

986
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:21,400
We're not gonna play until
these baskets get done,

987
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:22,600
and everything else gets done.

988
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:26,100
- What about this party mix?
- That's 'pot-pourri'.

989
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:27,600
This is perfect...

990
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:28,700
- Come on Felix,
take that off...

991
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:29,800
Have you ever
had one of these?

992
00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:31,400
- That's funny...
- You can't even see.

993
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:32,800
You'll have to,
to sleep with you...

994
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:34,500
- Take this.
- You could be like blinded.

995
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:37,300
No, I'm not playing
with baskets.

996
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:39,400
It's poker night.

997
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:42,500
You put 'Bayberry'
with 'Serenity'.

998
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:44,200
- You don't like?
- No, it's interesting.

999
00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:45,300
Just thought it
was obvious that...

1000
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:46,600
'Bayberry' worked
best with 'Harmony'.

1001
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:49,500
Really? I've been
putting 'Bayberry'...

1002
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:51,400
with 'Tahitian Sunrise'.

1003
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:53,200
- That I like. That's Zen.
- Yeah.

1004
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:54,700
You know what I
like? I like how...

1005
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:56,400
you put the bat ball
right in the center.

1006
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:58,200
I like that so much
that I'm gonna...

1007
00:47:58,300 --> 00:48:00,100
see you ball and raise
you another ball.

1008
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:00,700
That's a good idea.

1009
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:01,900
We should definitely
have 2 balls...

1010
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,900
- Yeah. Do another ball.
- Hey, Dennis...

1011
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,800
Come and curl some ribbon.

1012
00:48:05,900 --> 00:48:07,900
I can feel my sperm
dying inside...

1013
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,200
of me, one at a time.

1014
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:11,200
Shut up and grab a basket.
Come on, it's fun.

1015
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:13,500
I'm going to a strip club
to eat some meat.

1016
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:16,200
Then I'm gonna
get into a fight.

1017
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:18,000
Call me when you find your
balls, Tom.

1018
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:19,000
Alright, tuff guy.

1019
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:21,400
Or maybe they're
in the basket,

1020
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:23,700
next to the
'Tahitian Sunrise'.

1021
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:26,400
Someone's afraid of his
feminine side...

1022
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:28,800
Look at that... Nice job
with the fluffing.

1023
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:30,000
Look at that.

1024
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:32,100
- Perfect. Perfect.
- What is that, my friends.

1025
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:33,400
- Look at us.
- Come on.

1026
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:36,000
- Can't lose.
- Good work, huh?

1027
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:41,600
Hello ladies.
You look lovely today.

1028
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:43,300
- Tom.
- Oh, Hillary. How are you?

1029
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:45,900
Good. Everything
looks wonderful.

1030
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,600
This is the best shower
I've ever been to.

1031
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:48,900
Really? You think so?

1032
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:49,800
You know what, Hillary?

1033
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:51,100
You should really
eat something.

1034
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:53,500
No, Tom. I'm fine.

1035
00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:59,200
Fine. I'm okay.

1036
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:00,600
What you ladies would go...

1037
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:02,200
through to fit
in to a dress...

1038
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:04,000
This pretty much blows
your rule out of...

1039
00:49:04,100 --> 00:49:06,000
the water about no women
allowed at your place.

1040
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:06,800
What good is a rule if you...

1041
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:07,600
don't break it
every now and then?

1042
00:49:07,700 --> 00:49:10,200
I'm very, very impressed
Thank you.

1043
00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:12,300
Listen to that.

1044
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:15,700
Gay Gordon's party remix,
just for you.

1045
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:19,200
Hear the horn.

1046
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:20,700
- It's good isn't it?
- No.

1047
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:22,800
Let me turn it up there...
It's...

1048
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:24,500
- It's a little loud...
- What?

1049
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:27,600
- It's a little loud.
- Okay. There you go.

1050
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:29,600
Look at this. Try this.
Haggis pink.

1051
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:32,400
It's pepper, cheese,
chopped up baby...

1052
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:34,900
lamb lung, and cow
pituitary gland.

1053
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:35,700
- How are you?
- ...

1054
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:39,700
It's a Scottish delicacy.
Colin recommended it.

1055
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:43,300
Ladies, ladies.
Look...

1056
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:45,800
What just came,
for Hannah.

1057
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:49,700
It's from Colin, everyone.

1058
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:53,600
Oh wait. There's a card.
There's a card, a card...

1059
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:55,700
For: 'Hannah'.

1060
00:49:55,900 --> 00:49:58,600
'Hannah, my love, this
is the extremely...

1061
00:49:58,700 --> 00:50:00,900
rare Scottish floral
bud thistle'.

1062
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:01,900
Thistle?

1063
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:05,100
'They only bloom for 4 hours
before they die'.

1064
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:08,200
He must have timed this out
perfectly...

1065
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:09,600
Oh my gosh, when we first met,

1066
00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:11,300
Colin promised that
he would roam...

1067
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:15,000
at the countryside to
find me one, and he did.

1068
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:17,500
Sweetheart, that's
the most romantic...

1069
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:18,700
thing I ever heard.

1070
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:20,100
Thanks mom.

1071
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:22,200
Joan, good to see you.
It's been too long.

1072
00:50:22,300 --> 00:50:24,100
Easter, wasn't it?

1073
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:27,300
Yes. You slept with our maid.

1074
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:27,900
She told you?

1075
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,500
I didn't know she
spoke English.

1076
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:30,500
Yes...

1077
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:32,700
This is grandma Pearl.
You remember Tom?

1078
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:36,600
- How are you?
- Oh, yes, the fornicator.

1079
00:50:37,900 --> 00:50:39,700
That's right.

1080
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:42,700
- Okay...
- Tom, this is awesome.

1081
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:44,700
- It's great.
- Good. Thank you.

1082
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:46,400
This is even better than
my sister's shower.

1083
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:47,700
- Oh, really?
- Ahem...

1084
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:48,900
Everything seems to
be doing well. Yes?

1085
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,400
Sharon would like to know
where to set up.

1086
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:52,700
- Who?
- The entertainment...

1087
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:57,300
Ah, yes... I mean good.
She should set up over there.

1088
00:50:57,300 --> 00:51:00,000
Hello everybody.
Hi, I'm Sharon.

1089
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,600
Good to see you all.

1090
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:03,900
Yeah, come on, right
down the front.

1091
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,900
This was my idea, you know?

1092
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,200
I know how much
you loved her from

1093
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:08,400
Stephanie's sister's shower...

1094
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:09,900
Before we start, I
would like for us...

1095
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,000
all to take in
a deep breath...

1096
00:51:11,100 --> 00:51:13,400
She wasn't at the shower...

1097
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:14,900
- She wasn't?
- No.

1098
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,200
- And now exhale slowly...
- Really?

1099
00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:17,700
Good job.

1100
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:20,700
It's very important to
reset our third eye.

1101
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:22,200
And connect to...

1102
00:51:22,300 --> 00:51:24,800
the primal inside
of ourselves.

1103
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:27,000
Before I present the
pleasure aids.

1104
00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:28,500
Pleasure aids?

1105
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:29,900
Now...

1106
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,100
These pleasures are
best used when...

1107
00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:35,300
in tantric meditative state.

1108
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:38,100
And today, I'm going
to show you ladies...

1109
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:40,700
how to reach your
optimal sacred Chakra.

1110
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:43,100
All of these aids are
for sale, ladies.

1111
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:47,600
And look what we have here...
Edible panties.

1112
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:50,000
You look hungry.
Try to snack on these.

1113
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:52,100
There you go.

1114
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:53,800
Now ladies, what pleasure...

1115
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:55,800
party would be
complete without...

1116
00:51:55,900 --> 00:51:58,300
Glow-in-the-dark
thunder beads?

1117
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:00,200
These are terrific.
And for you ladies, today...

1118
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:01,700
Two for one.

1119
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:03,200
Okay?

1120
00:52:03,300 --> 00:52:06,700
There you go.
Wanna try this out, princess?

1121
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:08,800
Where do these go?

1122
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:14,200
From casual writing
to evening wear.

1123
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:15,300
Gorgeous.

1124
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:17,500
Why don't you keep those?

1125
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:20,900
And they match your
ear rings.

1126
00:52:31,700 --> 00:52:33,700
Hannah, are you okay?

1127
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:37,500
You know that I've dreamt
of my wedding shower,

1128
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:39,200
ever since I was
10 years old?

1129
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:40,200
No...

1130
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:41,700
Strangely enough, the image...

1131
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:43,100
of my grand mom,
pearl drape...

1132
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:44,500
and glow-in-the-dark
thunder beads...

1133
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:45,200
wasn't part of it.

1134
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:47,300
It's not funny, Tom.

1135
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:51,800
Do you have any idea how
important this is to me?

1136
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:55,800
The Gay Gordon, pink Haggis,
Dildo-sales woman?

1137
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:58,300
Just understand something,
Melissa set me up.

1138
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:02,100
Oh please. There's always
an excuse with you.

1139
00:53:02,300 --> 00:53:03,500
I never even should have asked...

1140
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:04,900
you to do this in
the first place.

1141
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,000
You don't even
believe in marriage...

1142
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:06,600
for Christ sake...

1143
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:08,700
You know, I might.

1144
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:13,600
I gotta get back.

1145
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:27,900
Melissa's pretty good.

1146
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,600
Look, the whole
goal here was to...

1147
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:31,300
convince Hannah
that I've grown up,

1148
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:34,100
and that she doesn't know
anything about Colin...

1149
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:36,700
That I'm the right
man for her.

1150
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:38,800
That did not happen.

1151
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:42,900
Stella. No, baby.
Don't eat buttons, okay?

1152
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:45,900
Yeah, but your still
the Maid of Honor, right Tom?

1153
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,600
I don't know. I think she
might have fired me.

1154
00:53:47,700 --> 00:53:48,400
How does somebody...

1155
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:49,800
get fired from
being Maid of Honor?

1156
00:53:49,900 --> 00:53:51,300
Tell me about it.

1157
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:53,300
- You know what?
I got an idea.

1158
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:53,600
Okay.

1159
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:55,600
To prove to Hannah that
you're the only man for her,

1160
00:53:55,700 --> 00:53:57,800
we have to make you the best
Made of Honor, ever.

1161
00:53:57,900 --> 00:53:59,300
Right.

1162
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:01,000
- I'm out of loss.
Completely stunned.

1163
00:54:01,100 --> 00:54:01,300
Great.

1164
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:02,800
My guy couldn't find any
dirt on Colin.

1165
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:04,800
This has never happened.
This guy's clean.

1166
00:54:04,900 --> 00:54:05,700
Glad that happened to me.

1167
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:07,400
You know, he's got
3 Guinness world records?

1168
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:07,800
- Cool.

1169
00:54:07,900 --> 00:54:09,100
We don't need to know that...

1170
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:11,000
He's actually got
a Medal of Honor.

1171
00:54:11,100 --> 00:54:15,000
That's funny, because we
got the Made of Honor.

1172
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:17,700
Let's stay focused.

1173
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:19,400
Look, the point is,
we're not gonna...

1174
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:20,300
get her off this guy.

1175
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:22,600
Yeah, so we need to make
this not about Colin.

1176
00:54:22,700 --> 00:54:24,000
Yeah, we need to
make it about you.

1177
00:54:24,100 --> 00:54:25,500
- Good...
- You gotta show her

1178
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:27,000
That you're growing up...
- Finally...

1179
00:54:27,100 --> 00:54:29,000
I am changing.
I am growing up.

1180
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:31,100
- Good.. Then this
should be easy for you.

1181
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:31,500
Great...

1182
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:33,400
These are bridal
magazines from...

1183
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:34,900
18 different countries...

1184
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,300
each with a feature article on...

1185
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:37,800
the duties of being
the Maid of Honor.

1186
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:39,800
Perfect.'Über Bride'...

1187
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:41,800
I got these guys in
Bangalore that we're...

1188
00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:44,000
outsource to, they
translated them over night.

1189
00:54:44,100 --> 00:54:44,500
- Great.

1190
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:46,400
Nice 'appetizers'
there, Gary...

1191
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:48,200
- Here's the 'Main course'
- What have you got for me?

1192
00:54:48,300 --> 00:54:50,100
My wife Deb is a
A-type personality,

1193
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:51,900
she has to do
everything perfect.

1194
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,100
- Sure...
- Love her...

1195
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:54,100
- Hate that about her.
- Right.

1196
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:55,600
Anyway, she rented this when...

1197
00:54:55,700 --> 00:54:57,400
she was gonna be
the Maid Of Honor...

1198
00:54:57,500 --> 00:54:59,200
for her yoga teacher.

1199
00:54:59,300 --> 00:55:03,000
This is 'the goods'.
You're gonna be wow-ed.

1200
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:05,800
12 Steps Down The Aisle

1201
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:13,300
Hi, I'm Elisabeth Hasselbeck
and I'm just so thrilled...

1202
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:14,900
you've purchased this program.

1203
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:15,900
And I'm proud of you...

1204
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,300
Because it shows that
you're not happy being just...

1205
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:20,200
an ordinary friend
and loved one.

1206
00:55:20,300 --> 00:55:23,100
No. You and I are
gonna work together...

1207
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:25,800
to make you the
perfect Maid of Honor.

1208
00:55:25,900 --> 00:55:27,200
When we're through,
you'll know...

1209
00:55:27,300 --> 00:55:28,900
everything there is to
know about dresses.

1210
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:32,500
Crockery, nuptial etiquette
and pleasing your bride.

1211
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:35,000
What's the length...
of the bridesmaid dress?

1212
00:55:35,100 --> 00:55:36,200
No longer than the brides.

1213
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:37,200
What if you know someone...

1214
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:38,600
won't be able to
attend the wedding?

1215
00:55:38,700 --> 00:55:40,400
You got to send an
invitation anyway.

1216
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:42,500
Receiving line?

1217
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:44,600
Receiving line?

1218
00:55:44,700 --> 00:55:46,300
If there's a receiving
line, it means I've failed,

1219
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:47,200
because Hannah's married.

1220
00:55:47,300 --> 00:55:49,300
Right. It was a
trick question.

1221
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:51,400
Who was the runner
up MVP in 1974?

1222
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:53,200
No, these questions all have
to do with Tom...

1223
00:55:53,300 --> 00:55:55,200
being the best Maid Of Honor
he can be.

1224
00:55:55,300 --> 00:55:56,600
Alright.

1225
00:55:56,700 --> 00:55:59,600
I thought we were just
asking like... Questions.

1226
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:01,300
Go sit down.

1227
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:03,200
Basic duties of the
Maid of Honor?

1228
00:56:03,300 --> 00:56:04,300
Manage the bridesmaids,

1229
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:06,300
carry the ring, and
support the bride.

1230
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:08,600
Basic duties as You as
the Maid of Honor?

1231
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:09,800
Show Hannah that I've matured,

1232
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:11,900
that I can take care of my
responsibilities fully...

1233
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,900
and that I need to destroy
the wedding from within.

1234
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,100
- What happens if you
fail at that task?

1235
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:17,200
Colin gets her.

1236
00:56:17,300 --> 00:56:19,600
- What are we gonna do?
- Steal the bride.

1237
00:56:19,700 --> 00:56:21,400
- What are we gonna do?
- Steal the bride.

1238
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:23,900
- What are we gonna do?
- Steal the bride.

1239
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
Steal the bride.

1240
00:56:26,100 --> 00:56:27,500
And remember...

1241
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:29,400
Weather it is helping
with the seating chart...

1242
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:30,700
or giving your
opinion on the cake,

1243
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:32,900
the perfect Maid Of Honor is...

1244
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,500
with her bride every
step of the way.

1245
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:38,000
You didn't have to clear your
whole day to do all this.

1246
00:56:38,100 --> 00:56:39,700
Are you kidding?
Off course I did.

1247
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:41,100
The perfect Maid of Honor is...

1248
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:42,800
with his bride every
step of the way.

1249
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:44,700
A changed man...

1250
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:46,800
I am indeed.

1251
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:49,300
I don't even know
where to begin.

1252
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:50,600
When choosing a china
pattern,

1253
00:56:50,700 --> 00:56:53,300
you need to think
about what type...

1254
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:57,400
of entertaining you're open
to, foods you wanna cook...

1255
00:56:57,500 --> 00:57:01,400
Look. Now don't be afraid
to mix and mash.

1256
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:04,100
It's important, even with
different styles and textures.

1257
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:06,700
What you wanna do, is stir
up the table.

1258
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:10,900
Make it come alive with color
and tenacity. That's the goal.

1259
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:14,900
Also, at the end of the day...
You will find...

1260
00:57:16,100 --> 00:57:18,100
...Connections.

1261
00:57:18,300 --> 00:57:20,300
Thank you very much.

1262
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:22,900
Let's go.

1263
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,200
If you think I'm
good with plates,

1264
00:57:24,300 --> 00:57:25,700
wait till you see what
I do with linens.

1265
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:27,800
- Lingerie, perfect.
- What about the linens?

1266
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:28,700
You'll be able to pick out...

1267
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:29,700
something for the
wedding night.

1268
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:30,800
- No.

1269
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:33,600
Are you crazy? You're the
perfect person for this job.

1270
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:36,300
Who's taken off more lingerie
than you?

1271
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:39,700
let's put your 'whore-ing'
to good use.

1272
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:41,800
Good point.

1273
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:46,100
So how did it go with the
Scottish Grand Council?

1274
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:49,900
Great. Colin got them to
approve everything.

1275
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
Great.

1276
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:55,100
So, I gotta tell you...

1277
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:57,700
This is gonna
sound funny, but...

1278
00:57:57,800 --> 00:58:00,600
- I have to thank you.
- For what?

1279
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:03,500
For asking me to be your
Maid of Honor.

1280
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:06,900
I know this is gonna
sound crazy, but...

1281
00:58:07,100 --> 00:58:10,900
You've really opened my eyes,
to the whole idea of marriage.

1282
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,900
- Yeah, right...
- No, seriously...

1283
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:17,900
- Have you met someone, Tom?
- No.

1284
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,400
Then how can you be serious?

1285
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:23,500
I don't know, I just...

1286
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
I don't know.

1287
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:50,900
What do you think?

1288
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,100
Think Colin will like it?

1289
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,700
No... no.

1290
00:58:57,800 --> 00:58:59,800
- What?
- It's just...

1291
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:02,800
It's cute.

1292
00:59:02,900 --> 00:59:06,400
'Cute'? I do not wanna look
'cute' on my wedding night.

1293
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:08,100
Just put this on.
Cover yourself up.

1294
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:09,700
That's my coat.

1295
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:12,300
- Thank you.
- Thank you. Yeah.

1296
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:19,500
Here let me get you
in a cab. Come on.

1297
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:22,200
I can't believe this is my
last day in New York.

1298
00:59:22,300 --> 00:59:24,600
What are you talking about?

1299
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:27,500
I've been meaning
to tell you, Tom.

1300
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:31,200
When I leave tomorrow,
I'm not coming back.

1301
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:35,700
I've decided to move to
Scotland, to be with Colin.

1302
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:38,600
- You're leaving New York?
- I am.

1303
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:42,500
It's exciting, you know?
It makes sense.

1304
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:46,200
He's next in line to take
over the family business...

1305
00:59:46,300 --> 00:59:48,400
It's a whole new chapter.

1306
00:59:53,300 --> 00:59:54,800
- You were amazing
today, you know that?

1307
00:59:54,900 --> 00:59:55,900
Oh, yeah?

1308
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,800
Yeah. I had no idea you could
juggle like that.

1309
00:59:58,900 --> 01:00:01,000
- Yeah, well...
- I mean, women yes, china no.

1310
01:00:01,100 --> 01:00:04,400
- Yeah, I know.
- You're always amazing.

1311
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:08,400
Come here.

1312
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:17,300
- See you in
Scotland soon, okay?

1313
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:19,500
Yeah, see you over there.

1314
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:23,400
I'll miss you.

1315
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:33,800
Scotland...

1316
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:45,400
Come, baby.

1317
01:00:49,300 --> 01:00:50,700
He likes you.

1318
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:52,800
- Hi.
- Hey.

1319
01:00:53,700 --> 01:00:54,700
- Nice dogs.

1320
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:56,500
This is Hamish and
this is Callum.

1321
01:00:56,600 --> 01:00:58,800
- Callum?
- Yeah.

1322
01:01:00,100 --> 01:01:01,300
What kind of dog is that?

1323
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:03,800
- He's a Scottie.
- A Scottie?

1324
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:08,600
That's perfect.
Fuckin Scottie...

1325
01:01:18,300 --> 01:01:20,700
I've never felt
like this before.

1326
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:22,000
So hopeless.

1327
01:01:22,100 --> 01:01:23,700
So, tell me again, why you...

1328
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:25,500
agreed to be the
Maid of Honor?

1329
01:01:25,600 --> 01:01:27,900
To be with her,
make her happy.

1330
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:31,000
Figure out some way to
get her off of him.

1331
01:01:31,100 --> 01:01:32,900
Maybe that was all
wrong. Maybe he's...

1332
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:34,000
better for her than me.

1333
01:01:34,100 --> 01:01:36,200
He's Scottish, he can dunk,
he's perfect.

1334
01:01:36,300 --> 01:01:38,500
Nobody's perfect.
But I tell you,

1335
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:40,700
this whiskey comes
damn close...

1336
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:43,700
It was a gift from Colin.
He made it.

1337
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:45,800
Swell.

1338
01:01:46,100 --> 01:01:50,100
I can't go. I can't watch
Hannah marry this guy.

1339
01:01:50,700 --> 01:01:52,700
She's moving to Scotland,
I've lost her already.

1340
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:53,800
- Crap.

1341
01:01:53,900 --> 01:01:55,600
'...Love something,
set it free'.

1342
01:01:55,700 --> 01:01:59,600
Said by a pussy and used
by pussies ever since.

1343
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:02,600
- Casablanca.'Bogie'
put's her on a plane.

1344
01:02:02,700 --> 01:02:03,700
Pussy.

1345
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:06,500
- 'Bogie’s a pussy?
- Big pussy.

1346
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:10,300
You know, I've only
truly been in love once.

1347
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:12,800
Most amazing woman
in the world.

1348
01:02:12,900 --> 01:02:14,600
She was my best friend.

1349
01:02:14,700 --> 01:02:18,600
But I was young, stupid,
and I messed it up.

1350
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:22,400
In my great list of mistakes,
that was the greatest.

1351
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:25,000
- Who was this?
- Your mother.

1352
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:29,000
When I finally
found out how stupid

1353
01:02:29,100 --> 01:02:31,600
I was and I decided
to fight for it...

1354
01:02:31,700 --> 01:02:33,700
I was too late.

1355
01:02:34,700 --> 01:02:36,900
She wouldn't take me back.

1356
01:02:37,300 --> 01:02:39,300
She was right.

1357
01:02:40,700 --> 01:02:43,300
And then it really
was too late.

1358
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:54,900
By the way...
I'm getting another divorce.

1359
01:02:59,300 --> 01:03:01,300
Dad...

1360
01:03:05,500 --> 01:03:08,500
Hey... Go and get her,
you pussy.

1361
01:03:11,900 --> 01:03:12,900
- What about the dresses?

1362
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:14,600
UPS are delivering
them tomorrow morning.

1363
01:03:14,700 --> 01:03:17,700
- I gave you the
tracking address...

1364
01:03:17,700 --> 01:03:18,900
I got it.

1365
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:22,100
So, Colin and Hannah are gonna
meet everyone at the house...

1366
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:24,200
- Okay.
- Great.

1367
01:03:24,500 --> 01:03:25,800
- Thomas.
- Yeah?

1368
01:03:25,900 --> 01:03:27,400
Go get 'em, Maid of Honor.

1369
01:03:27,500 --> 01:03:28,500
- Yeah.

1370
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:30,800
Make this the perfect wedding.

1371
01:03:30,900 --> 01:03:34,200
- And steal the bride.
- Thanks, guys. Thanks.

1372
01:03:34,300 --> 01:03:36,700
Thanks for everything, man.
Thank you so much, alright?

1373
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:37,800
- Alright, baby.

1374
01:03:37,900 --> 01:03:40,200
Alright. Alright,
alright. Get out of here.

1375
01:03:40,300 --> 01:03:42,300
I'll see you later.

1376
01:03:49,500 --> 01:03:53,900
- This is like a fairy tale.
- Hannah is SO lucky.

1377
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,100
- I know.
- I wish I was her.

1378
01:03:56,200 --> 01:03:58,400
- How has she ever
found such a great guy?

1379
01:03:58,500 --> 01:03:59,600
We'll come visit her.

1380
01:03:59,700 --> 01:04:02,300
- I know...
- Look at the time.

1381
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:32,700
What's your name?

1382
01:04:32,700 --> 01:04:35,700
You're a pretty dog.
I love you.

1383
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:44,500
- That's his house?

1384
01:04:44,600 --> 01:04:46,600
No, isn't this
the summer house?

1385
01:04:46,700 --> 01:04:48,700
The McMurray's have
homes for each...

1386
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:51,200
season. This summer
home, is their smallest.

1387
01:04:51,300 --> 01:04:53,800
They also have an Autumn home,
a Winter home, a Spring...

1388
01:04:53,900 --> 01:04:55,700
I know the seasons,
thanks, buddy.

1389
01:04:55,800 --> 01:04:57,200
Somebody's richer
thank you, Tom.

1390
01:04:57,300 --> 01:04:59,800
I guess you are gonna have to...

1391
01:04:59,900 --> 01:05:02,600
invent something
even stupider.

1392
01:05:22,200 --> 01:05:24,200
Oh, my God.

1393
01:05:30,100 --> 01:05:32,600
The entire castle
was actually build...

1394
01:05:32,700 --> 01:05:33,700
in 1220...

1395
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:36,500
- This is
incredible, isn't it?

1396
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:38,400
Yes...Wow...

1397
01:05:38,500 --> 01:05:41,000
Grandma Pearl, Joan, this is...

1398
01:05:41,100 --> 01:05:44,400
my mother, Diedre
and my father, Mungo.

1399
01:05:46,700 --> 01:05:48,300
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

1400
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:48,800
- How do you do?

1401
01:05:48,900 --> 01:05:49,700
Nice to meet you,
Joan. Pleasure.

1402
01:05:49,800 --> 01:05:51,300
- Thank you.
- Nice to meet you.

1403
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:52,800
Everyone, I want you
to meet someone...

1404
01:05:52,900 --> 01:05:54,100
who is so special
to my Hannah...

1405
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:57,000
and who has been her
life-long friend,

1406
01:05:57,100 --> 01:05:59,400
and now her Maid
of Honor, Tom.

1407
01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:00,500
- Hi, how is...

1408
01:06:00,600 --> 01:06:03,100
Did he just say he's
the Maid of Honor...

1409
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:04,200
He's a bloke?.

1410
01:06:04,300 --> 01:06:06,000
- How do you do?
- Very good, thank you.

1411
01:06:06,100 --> 01:06:07,700
- Mungo.
- Mungo, pleasure. Thank you.

1412
01:06:07,800 --> 01:06:09,900
Definitely gay.

1413
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,500
And these are the bridesmaids.

1414
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:15,100
Hillary, Stephanie
and Melissa.

1415
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:16,800
- How do you do?
- Hello.

1416
01:06:16,900 --> 01:06:17,900
- Hi.

1417
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:21,100
Nice that you could
come. How do you do?

1418
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:23,200
How do you do?

1419
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:28,800
- So... what do you think?
- I think, they think I'm gay.

1420
01:06:28,900 --> 01:06:31,100
Look can we get together,
talk, catch up?

1421
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:33,200
- Tom, do wanna
see your chamber?

1422
01:06:33,300 --> 01:06:33,700
Love to.

1423
01:06:33,800 --> 01:06:36,200
- Okay, follow me
- Thank you.

1424
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
Thank you.

1425
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:51,200
Thank you.

1426
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:54,000
Now then... I think
just a few more...

1427
01:06:54,100 --> 01:06:57,000
sprigs of jipsoffle
at the front there...

1428
01:06:57,100 --> 01:06:59,100
Lovely.

1429
01:06:59,300 --> 01:07:02,500
- What do you guys think?
- Oh.. It is gorgeous...

1430
01:07:02,600 --> 01:07:04,400
- It is so pretty...
With the veil...

1431
01:07:04,500 --> 01:07:05,800
So shiny, and the volume...

1432
01:07:05,900 --> 01:07:08,000
Tom... What do you think?

1433
01:07:08,600 --> 01:07:13,300
Of...?
The hair. Yeah, it...

1434
01:07:13,900 --> 01:07:16,600
This sash will
go on the dress.

1435
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:20,100
- Really?
- Tradition.

1436
01:07:22,900 --> 01:07:24,100
What's up with that?

1437
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:25,300
Well...

1438
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:28,400
I'm not.. entirely sure...

1439
01:07:28,500 --> 01:07:31,000
Oh no, you see...
It's attached up here...

1440
01:07:31,100 --> 01:07:32,600
Tom, you're the Maid of Honor,

1441
01:07:32,700 --> 01:07:34,400
it's good to just
be supportive...

1442
01:07:34,500 --> 01:07:36,400
- I'm supportive.
- I don't think you are.

1443
01:07:36,500 --> 01:07:37,900
- No, I am.
- Listen to me...

1444
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,200
You're doing good,
you're good...

1445
01:07:40,300 --> 01:07:42,000
Hannah...

1446
01:07:42,100 --> 01:07:45,900
Actually, your hair...
Looks amazing.

1447
01:07:46,300 --> 01:07:48,300
- Really?
- Yes.

1448
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:51,200
The games will be
starting soon.

1449
01:07:51,300 --> 01:07:52,600
Here are your costumes.

1450
01:07:52,700 --> 01:07:54,900
- Games?
- Costumes.

1451
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,300
- Our costumes?
- What do you mean, games?

1452
01:07:57,400 --> 01:07:58,700
The Highland games.

1453
01:07:58,800 --> 01:08:01,500
It's a tradition,
in honor of the wedding.

1454
01:08:01,600 --> 01:08:04,100
It goes right back to the time
when the groom had to prove...

1455
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:06,500
that he was man enough to
deserve the bride.

1456
01:08:06,600 --> 01:08:09,800
If he didn't win, he
didn't get the bride.

1457
01:08:09,900 --> 01:08:12,100
No problem for my Colin...

1458
01:08:16,900 --> 01:08:20,500
Welcome, one and all
to the Highland Games.

1459
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:22,400
Men have travelled
from all four...

1460
01:08:22,500 --> 01:08:23,900
corners of this
great country...

1461
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:27,000
to compete in feats of
strength and agility.

1462
01:08:27,100 --> 01:08:32,000
But only one warrior will be
man enough to claim the bride.

1463
01:08:33,700 --> 01:08:36,500
One warrior that needs
no introduction...

1464
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:38,700
is our very own
Colin McMurray.

1465
01:08:38,800 --> 01:08:41,200
- Isn't Colin handsome?
- And coming up,

1466
01:08:41,300 --> 01:08:44,100
here, all the
way from America.

1467
01:08:44,200 --> 01:08:46,800
Hannah's Maid of Honor, Tom.

1468
01:08:47,900 --> 01:08:50,200
Who I think you can all agree,

1469
01:08:50,300 --> 01:08:53,400
is wearing a rather
fetching mini-kilt.

1470
01:08:53,500 --> 01:08:57,300
- Who was in charge of that?
- I have no idea.

1471
01:09:19,900 --> 01:09:22,400
They're really
giving their all.

1472
01:09:22,500 --> 01:09:25,700
And we're running
neck and neck...

1473
01:09:25,800 --> 01:09:28,700
A Scottish man against a Yank.

1474
01:09:29,300 --> 01:09:31,000
Ladies and gentlemen,

1475
01:09:31,100 --> 01:09:33,800
the result of today's
Highland Games...

1476
01:09:33,900 --> 01:09:35,800
rests upon the 'Cable Toss'.

1477
01:09:35,900 --> 01:09:38,800
The competition is down to
2 competitors.

1478
01:09:38,900 --> 01:09:41,500
A tree...
We're tossing a tree?

1479
01:09:45,300 --> 01:09:47,300
What a toss.

1480
01:09:48,400 --> 01:09:50,400
Way to go, Colin.

1481
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:53,800
Okay, Tom. Let's see
what you're made of.

1482
01:09:54,100 --> 01:09:57,300
The whole competition rests
on this throw.

1483
01:09:57,400 --> 01:10:00,300
Look at that Yankee..

1484
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:02,400
Alright. Okay..

1485
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,800
Come on, Tom.
Oh gosh...

1486
01:10:07,100 --> 01:10:09,600
Okay. I can do this.
I can do this. Okay.

1487
01:10:09,700 --> 01:10:11,700
Here we go. Great.

1488
01:10:12,200 --> 01:10:14,200
Okay. Okay.

1489
01:10:15,100 --> 01:10:16,300
Here we go. Here we go.

1490
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:18,400
Here we go, Oh...

1491
01:10:19,500 --> 01:10:21,500
Watch out, watch out.

1492
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:41,200
That's gonna cost the Yank
the gold medal.

1493
01:10:42,900 --> 01:10:43,900
- What an ass.

1494
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,800
And the winner of the
Highland Games is,

1495
01:10:46,900 --> 01:10:49,600
our very own Colin McMurray.

1496
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:02,600
That's great.

1497
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:07,400
*For my love is
like a melody*...

1498
01:11:07,500 --> 01:11:10,500
*That sweetly
played in June*...

1499
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:14,700
*As fair art thou,
my bonny lass*...

1500
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:18,100
*say deep in love am I*...

1501
01:11:18,200 --> 01:11:24,000
*And I will love thee
still, my dear*...

1502
01:11:24,100 --> 01:11:27,800
*till all the
seas gang dry*...

1503
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:34,400
*And I will love thee still,
My dear*...

1504
01:11:34,700 --> 01:11:40,100
*Though t'were 10
thousand miles*.

1505
01:11:43,700 --> 01:11:45,200
Well done, My boy.

1506
01:11:45,300 --> 01:11:47,300
Well done.

1507
01:11:49,300 --> 01:11:50,800
That was so....

1508
01:11:50,900 --> 01:11:52,900
Well done, my boy.

1509
01:12:01,100 --> 01:12:03,900
Robert Burns, who
wrote that song,

1510
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,700
is Scotland's
most famous poet.

1511
01:12:09,100 --> 01:12:11,400
No, no, Auntie. We haven't
had any 'bairns' yet,

1512
01:12:11,500 --> 01:12:13,000
so we haven't got
any names yet.

1513
01:12:13,100 --> 01:12:14,600
'Bairns' means children.

1514
01:12:14,700 --> 01:12:16,600
I'm so sorry, I'm
having a hard...

1515
01:12:16,700 --> 01:12:18,300
time understanding
your accent.

1516
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:20,600
- 'Ethel'.
- Excuse me?

1517
01:12:21,200 --> 01:12:23,400
It's a name, for the children.

1518
01:12:23,500 --> 01:12:25,500
- 'Ethel'.
- 'Ethel'...

1519
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:28,600
Little Ethel.

1520
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:33,500
Yeah. We won't be naming our
child Ethel.

1521
01:12:34,100 --> 01:12:36,100
Maybe if he was a teenager...

1522
01:12:36,200 --> 01:12:38,400
My mother's third cousin was
the Duke of Ethel.

1523
01:12:38,500 --> 01:12:41,300
We're a long line
of 'Ethel’s'.

1524
01:12:42,100 --> 01:12:44,400
Maybe... Maybe we'll keep...

1525
01:12:44,500 --> 01:12:47,900
it in the mix, maybe
as a middle name...

1526
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:02,200
- So, Hannah, do you
like the venison?

1527
01:13:02,300 --> 01:13:03,500
It's delicious.

1528
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:06,700
Colin shot it.
He's a wonderful Shot.

1529
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:08,700
- Stop, mum. You'll
make me blush.

1530
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:11,500
And this is the moment.
I've just remembered.

1531
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:14,700
- What moment is that?
- When Colin killed the deer.

1532
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:16,800
I filmed it.

1533
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:22,100
Right between the eyes.

1534
01:13:24,300 --> 01:13:27,200
In fact, everything
we are eating...

1535
01:13:27,300 --> 01:13:30,000
this evening,
Colin has killed.

1536
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:32,000
- To Colin.
- To Colin.

1537
01:13:32,100 --> 01:13:34,100
In your honor, Hannah.

1538
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:36,900
That is so thoughtful...

1539
01:13:37,100 --> 01:13:41,000
I'm so sorry, I didn't kill
anything for you...

1540
01:13:47,200 --> 01:13:49,700
Gosh...
What did you get?

1541
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:52,300
- Uhm...
- I love chocolate.

1542
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:54,800
Don't... Don't do that.

1543
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:57,600
You want some...

1544
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,100
Here. I'll give you some.

1545
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,400
Excuse me.
Reverend...

1546
01:14:16,700 --> 01:14:20,400
Excuse me, sir. There you go.
Wonderful dinner, by the way.

1547
01:14:20,500 --> 01:14:22,500
- Delighted, Tom.
- And your wife is beautiful.

1548
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:24,600
Thank you very much.

1549
01:14:25,100 --> 01:14:27,100
- Thanks.
- Cheers.

1550
01:14:28,700 --> 01:14:31,100
A little birdie tells me
that Colin personally...

1551
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:33,200
slayed each one of
these reindeer heads...

1552
01:14:33,300 --> 01:14:35,300
- Tom...
- Alright.

1553
01:14:35,300 --> 01:14:37,000
I say 'a little
birdie told me'.

1554
01:14:37,100 --> 01:14:39,300
He would have told
me, but Colin shot it.

1555
01:14:39,400 --> 01:14:41,400
Listen, seriously...

1556
01:14:41,500 --> 01:14:45,200
Can we go somewhere private
and talk? It's important.

1557
01:14:45,300 --> 01:14:48,200
- Yeah.
- Should we go?

1558
01:14:51,700 --> 01:14:53,700
Bagpipes...

1559
01:14:54,900 --> 01:14:57,100
Oh, My God...

1560
01:14:57,200 --> 01:15:00,300
He's been playing the
bag pipes ever since...

1561
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:03,300
he was 3 years old.
Practices every night.

1562
01:15:03,400 --> 01:15:05,900
- Every night?
- Never misses.

1563
01:15:09,300 --> 01:15:12,100
- What kind of
necklace is that?

1564
01:15:12,200 --> 01:15:15,500
They're glow-in-the-dark
thunder beets.

1565
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:30,900
- Hi, mom.
- I have something for you.

1566
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:37,500
- Some evening, huh?
- Yes...

1567
01:15:39,700 --> 01:15:41,600
This is so you can
have a little...

1568
01:15:41,700 --> 01:15:43,000
piece of home with you.

1569
01:15:43,100 --> 01:15:45,100
Thank you.

1570
01:15:47,700 --> 01:15:50,200
Look at you...

1571
01:15:50,900 --> 01:15:55,000
There's you and Melissa.
You were about 5 there.

1572
01:15:58,000 --> 01:15:59,400
Do you remember this?

1573
01:15:59,500 --> 01:16:02,200
It was taken at the
lake, when you father...

1574
01:16:02,300 --> 01:16:05,700
broke his arm, because of
that silly motorcycle of his.

1575
01:16:05,800 --> 01:16:09,600
- I miss dad so much
- Me too, Sweetheart.

1576
01:16:09,700 --> 01:16:12,100
I just wish that he could
have been here.

1577
01:16:12,200 --> 01:16:15,600
He was always so worried,
I was never gonna meet anyone.

1578
01:16:15,700 --> 01:16:18,600
- No, he wasn't.
- That's Paris.

1579
01:16:18,700 --> 01:16:21,100
He could be so 'off
days' sometimes...

1580
01:16:21,200 --> 01:16:22,700
What?

1581
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:26,400
Well, it's just... He
was always convinced...

1582
01:16:26,500 --> 01:16:29,100
that you were gonna marry Tom.

1583
01:16:29,100 --> 01:16:31,100
Really?

1584
01:16:33,500 --> 01:16:38,000
- I'll see you in the morning.
- Good night, My Angel.

1585
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
It's pulling off a band aid.

1586
01:16:42,100 --> 01:16:45,200
You just have to close
your eyes and do it.

1587
01:16:45,300 --> 01:16:47,200
- I just haven't
found the right time.

1588
01:16:47,300 --> 01:16:49,300
What are you talking
about, 'right time'?

1589
01:16:49,400 --> 01:16:52,200
Anytime is the
right time to say...

1590
01:16:52,300 --> 01:16:54,000
'I love you, marry me'.

1591
01:16:54,100 --> 01:16:55,100
- Right.

1592
01:16:55,200 --> 01:16:56,800
Come on, what are
you there for, man?

1593
01:16:56,900 --> 01:17:00,300
Take the shot, win the game
and bring her home.

1594
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:02,000
And stop running up
my long-distance...

1595
01:17:02,100 --> 01:17:03,500
phone bill with
these crazy calls..

1596
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:06,900
Right, right okay.
Thanks, Felix.

1597
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:11,000
God, come on. You
can do this, Tom.

1598
01:17:11,100 --> 01:17:14,300
What's wrong with
me? You can do this.

1599
01:17:25,400 --> 01:17:26,400
- Hey.
- Hey.

1600
01:17:26,500 --> 01:17:29,900
I thought we could go for a
walk and work on the vows.

1601
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:33,700
- Good idea. I need some help.
- Good. Okay.

1602
01:17:36,900 --> 01:17:38,800
- What do you think?
- I think a lot of things.

1603
01:17:38,900 --> 01:17:40,100
I've been working
on them all week...

1604
01:17:40,200 --> 01:17:41,500
and I actually think
they're getting worse.

1605
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:43,300
At first I went
for the 'emotion'.

1606
01:17:43,400 --> 01:17:45,100
I thought: 'What
if Colin does it'?

1607
01:17:45,200 --> 01:17:46,600
Then I tried to be funny...

1608
01:17:46,700 --> 01:17:48,100
I don't know if Scots
have the same...

1609
01:17:48,200 --> 01:17:49,200
sense of humor as Americans.

1610
01:17:49,300 --> 01:17:50,700
So now I am back to
something basic...

1611
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:51,900
and I totally think
I've geared...

1612
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:52,900
off into something boring...

1613
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:53,900
I'm crazy about you.

1614
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:55,700
I think of you
all the time and

1615
01:17:55,800 --> 01:17:58,200
I wanna spend the rest
of my life with you.

1616
01:17:58,300 --> 01:18:00,000
Really?

1617
01:18:00,100 --> 01:18:01,300
Really.

1618
01:18:01,400 --> 01:18:03,800
- That's so 'generic'.
- Generic?

1619
01:18:03,900 --> 01:18:05,700
- Yeah.
- Generic?

1620
01:18:05,800 --> 01:18:07,500
- It totally is.
- How can that be generic?

1621
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:11,200
It sounds like something
you're supposed...

1622
01:18:11,200 --> 01:18:14,900
to say instead of what
your really feeling.

1623
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:17,400
Alright. How about...

1624
01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:25,000
Nobody in the world makes
me laugh the way you do.

1625
01:18:26,100 --> 01:18:28,100
You're my best friend.

1626
01:18:30,500 --> 01:18:33,200
I just wanna be with you.

1627
01:18:34,200 --> 01:18:38,200
Look, look.
There she is.

1628
01:18:39,500 --> 01:18:41,900
Let's go, let's go.

1629
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,900
- Hannah, let's go.
- What is this?

1630
01:18:45,300 --> 01:18:47,500
- It's her 'taking out'.
- Her... What?

1631
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:48,800
We dress her up and then we...

1632
01:18:48,900 --> 01:18:50,400
parade around one of
the pubs in town.

1633
01:18:50,500 --> 01:18:52,200
- That's weird...
- It's tradition.

1634
01:18:52,300 --> 01:18:52,700
- Really?

1635
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:54,700
Then we fill a
toilet with salt...

1636
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:57,100
and we sell your kisses
for change.

1637
01:18:57,200 --> 01:19:00,600
- Sell your kisses?
- Yep.

1638
01:19:02,200 --> 01:19:06,300
Come on, it's like a Scottish
Bachelorette-party.

1639
01:19:08,900 --> 01:19:11,000
Okay, Okay...

1640
01:19:22,100 --> 01:19:25,400
- Okay, come on.

1641
01:19:35,700 --> 01:19:39,700
Change for kisses.
Right there...

1642
01:19:40,700 --> 01:19:42,700
Instead of Whiskeys.

1643
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:45,600
It's her 'taking-out'.

1644
01:19:45,700 --> 01:19:48,500
She's got the
breath of an angel.

1645
01:20:27,300 --> 01:20:31,100
One more, alright, alright.

1646
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:37,900
- Another.
- Another.

1647
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
Thank you.

1648
01:20:43,500 --> 01:20:45,500
This is all I have.

1649
01:21:30,500 --> 01:21:33,300
- Oh, my God. My
God, you guys.

1650
01:21:33,400 --> 01:21:34,800
Let's go.

1651
01:21:34,900 --> 01:21:38,000
We have to get more kisses.

1652
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:40,800
Kisses.

1653
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,300
- I can't take it anymore.
- What are you doing?

1654
01:22:47,400 --> 01:22:48,400
- Let's do it again.
- No.

1655
01:22:48,500 --> 01:22:50,600
- For old time's sake...
- Don't take that off.

1656
01:22:50,700 --> 01:22:52,800
- I need to make
this up to you...

1657
01:22:52,900 --> 01:22:54,300
Don't... take... this.

1658
01:22:54,400 --> 01:22:57,400
No, I'm really unhappy.

1659
01:22:57,500 --> 01:22:58,300
- That's fine.
- Tom...

1660
01:22:58,400 --> 01:23:01,200
- It's okay. It's okay...
- I'm not happy at all.

1661
01:23:01,300 --> 01:23:03,300
- Get up...
- And I am in a really...

1662
01:23:03,400 --> 01:23:07,100
confusing place in my life
right now...

1663
01:23:08,300 --> 01:23:09,800
- Confusing?
- Listen...

1664
01:23:09,900 --> 01:23:12,900
- I have had some whiskey...
- I can tell.

1665
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,100
And I need you
to 'service' me.

1666
01:23:15,200 --> 01:23:17,000
- 'Service' you? I not
gonna 'service you'...

1667
01:23:17,100 --> 01:23:17,800
'Service me', bitch.

1668
01:23:17,900 --> 01:23:19,500
- Oh, my...
'Service me'.

1669
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:21,900
- Be quiet.
- You be quiet.

1670
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
Everyone's sleeping...

1671
01:23:24,100 --> 01:23:26,100
- Get down.
- You can't get down.

1672
01:23:26,200 --> 01:23:27,100
You can't...

1673
01:23:27,200 --> 01:23:29,400
- Be quiet.
- You be quiet.

1674
01:23:29,500 --> 01:23:33,000
No. No. Get off.

1675
01:23:34,900 --> 01:23:36,900
Wait... Wait...

1676
01:23:37,200 --> 01:23:40,200
- Hannah...
- Bring me more whiskey.

1677
01:23:43,300 --> 01:23:45,000
Hannah.

1678
01:23:45,100 --> 01:23:47,300
It's Tom, let me in.
Let me in.

1679
01:23:47,400 --> 01:23:48,900
Go away, Tom.

1680
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,100
No. Let me explain.
It's not what you think.

1681
01:23:51,200 --> 01:23:53,400
- It doesn't matter now.
- Yes it does. Why did you...

1682
01:23:53,500 --> 01:23:54,500
- Just... Go.

1683
01:23:54,600 --> 01:23:56,400
I'll go. Just tell me, why...

1684
01:23:56,500 --> 01:23:58,600
did you come to my room?

1685
01:24:00,900 --> 01:24:04,300
Hannah... Why did you
come to the room?

1686
01:24:04,400 --> 01:24:06,900
To talk about that kiss.

1687
01:24:13,200 --> 01:24:16,700
Please, don't...
Don't marry him.

1688
01:24:17,500 --> 01:24:20,100
- All these years, Tom...
- Don't marry him...

1689
01:24:20,200 --> 01:24:22,500
All this time...

1690
01:24:22,700 --> 01:24:26,000
- You're doing this now?
- I know...

1691
01:24:26,100 --> 01:24:29,200
- How can you do this?
- I'm sorry... Just let me in.

1692
01:24:29,300 --> 01:24:32,500
- No. I can't.
- Let me in.

1693
01:24:32,600 --> 01:24:35,600
You're only doing
this now because...

1694
01:24:35,700 --> 01:24:38,000
you are afraid of losing me.

1695
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:43,500
I need someone who's gonna
be there for me,

1696
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:45,800
no matter what happens.

1697
01:24:49,700 --> 01:24:53,500
Someone who truly...
Loves me.

1698
01:24:57,100 --> 01:24:59,200
Someone I can trust.

1699
01:25:06,600 --> 01:25:11,100
I'm marrying Colin tomorrow...
Tom.

1700
01:25:29,400 --> 01:25:31,800
I can't be your
Maid of Honor.

1701
01:25:33,200 --> 01:25:35,200
I can't give you away.

1702
01:25:43,600 --> 01:25:45,600
I'm sorry, Hannah.

1703
01:25:47,300 --> 01:25:50,100
I'm sorry, you and Tom
had a fight.

1704
01:25:50,800 --> 01:25:52,800
I'm his best friend.

1705
01:25:53,600 --> 01:25:56,100
He's just afraid of
loosing me.

1706
01:25:58,500 --> 01:26:01,300
- He'll get over it.
- Ay.

1707
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:33,500
- Suck it. Suck it.
- I am.

1708
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:35,700
- Okay. Suck it
in. Breath in...

1709
01:26:35,800 --> 01:26:38,900
- Hold it...
- I'm trying, my God..

1710
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:41,200
- I'll hold it in.
- Okay. Alright, alright.

1711
01:26:41,300 --> 01:26:46,000
- Give it to me..
- 1, 2, 3...

1712
01:26:48,200 --> 01:26:50,500
- Is it?...
- Oh, My God.

1713
01:26:50,600 --> 01:26:52,300
- It fits, it fits.

1714
01:26:52,400 --> 01:26:55,200
- It fits.
- Well done.

1715
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:59,000
- Oh no. No, no...
- My God... no...

1716
01:27:25,900 --> 01:27:28,500
- Why are we stopping?
- An early flock.

1717
01:27:28,600 --> 01:27:30,600
A... What?

1718
01:27:47,500 --> 01:27:49,500
Hi, Sweetheart.

1719
01:28:14,700 --> 01:28:16,700
I remember you.

1720
01:28:17,400 --> 01:28:19,400
Hey.

1721
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
Hi.

1722
01:28:30,300 --> 01:28:32,300
I love you too.

1723
01:28:32,700 --> 01:28:34,700
Thank you.

1724
01:28:35,700 --> 01:28:38,300
Turn around,
I have to go back.

1725
01:29:04,600 --> 01:29:06,600
Oh, no.

1726
01:29:08,200 --> 01:29:12,200
Oh no.
Shit... Shit.

1727
01:29:12,300 --> 01:29:14,100
- Hey, I need
another ferry-boat.

1728
01:29:14,200 --> 01:29:15,500
We only got the one ferry.

1729
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:16,600
- What?

1730
01:29:16,700 --> 01:29:19,200
And it's waiting over there
for the ceremony to finish.

1731
01:29:19,300 --> 01:29:21,000
- Is there another
way to get there?

1732
01:29:21,100 --> 01:29:21,700
You can drive.

1733
01:29:21,800 --> 01:29:22,500
- Drive... How long?

1734
01:29:22,600 --> 01:29:24,100
It will take about an
hour and a half...

1735
01:29:24,200 --> 01:29:25,700
- That's too long.
- You can swim.

1736
01:29:25,800 --> 01:29:26,200
- Swim?..

1737
01:29:26,300 --> 01:29:28,100
Or you can go on trip
around the shore.

1738
01:29:28,200 --> 01:29:32,100
- That will take a wee while.
- Shore, right...

1739
01:29:32,600 --> 01:29:35,800
A horse. A horse.
Hey, I need your horse.

1740
01:29:35,900 --> 01:29:37,900
- My horse?
- Yes.

1741
01:29:38,700 --> 01:29:41,100
- Come down from there.
- I need to get to the church.

1742
01:29:41,200 --> 01:29:42,400
What do think you're
planning, you...

1743
01:29:42,500 --> 01:29:43,500
great fool? You'll
hurt yourself.

1744
01:29:43,600 --> 01:29:44,600
I'll give you 3 cents for...

1745
01:29:44,700 --> 01:29:45,900
every coffee collar
used worldwide.

1746
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:47,000
- What?

1747
01:29:47,100 --> 01:29:48,400
Do you have any idea
how much money that is?

1748
01:29:48,500 --> 01:29:50,200
Good luck to you, then.
Her name's Nancy.

1749
01:29:50,300 --> 01:29:54,600
- I'll see you over there
- Thanks. Nancy, let's go.

1750
01:29:56,600 --> 01:29:59,200
Stick to the shore... Pass the...

1751
01:29:59,300 --> 01:30:02,400
monument, the church
is on the left.

1752
01:30:02,700 --> 01:30:05,500
What, in the name
of the wee man,

1753
01:30:05,600 --> 01:30:07,600
is a 'Coffee collar'?

1754
01:30:07,900 --> 01:30:09,900
Go, Nancy.

1755
01:30:14,300 --> 01:30:17,800
This is just what
this nice dress needs...

1756
01:30:17,900 --> 01:30:22,600
and it goes across the dress.
It looks really beautiful.

1757
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
Please, be seated.

1758
01:30:50,100 --> 01:30:53,000
We are gathered here together,
in the sight of God...

1759
01:30:53,100 --> 01:30:54,000
- Give me your pin...

1760
01:30:54,100 --> 01:30:55,400
to witness this
congregation...

1761
01:30:55,500 --> 01:30:58,100
To join together this man...

1762
01:31:03,200 --> 01:31:05,700
This is a celebration of love.

1763
01:31:06,200 --> 01:31:08,000
For Colin, it's
through the memories...

1764
01:31:08,100 --> 01:31:09,400
of seeing his parent's love.

1765
01:31:09,500 --> 01:31:11,300
- ...As a child.
- It looks very nice.

1766
01:31:11,400 --> 01:31:13,200
And for Hannah, it's...

1767
01:31:13,300 --> 01:31:16,300
through the paintings
of Modigliani.

1768
01:31:16,300 --> 01:31:19,100
Therefore, if any man
can show just cause...

1769
01:31:19,200 --> 01:31:21,900
why these two may not
be joined together...

1770
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:25,800
Let him now speak,
or forever hold his peace.

1771
01:31:32,500 --> 01:31:34,500
Tom?

1772
01:31:41,500 --> 01:31:43,300
Tom?

1773
01:31:43,400 --> 01:31:45,400
Tom.

1774
01:31:45,700 --> 01:31:48,400
Tom.
Tom?

1775
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
Tom.

1776
01:31:52,700 --> 01:31:54,800
Tom...

1777
01:31:56,700 --> 01:31:58,000
Tom.

1778
01:31:58,100 --> 01:32:00,900
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I think so.

1779
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:03,100
- Tom, what are
you doing here?

1780
01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:05,400
I have to tell
you something...

1781
01:32:05,500 --> 01:32:07,500
Hannah...

1782
01:32:09,800 --> 01:32:11,000
Your hair looks awful.

1783
01:32:11,100 --> 01:32:12,400
- It does?
- Yeah.

1784
01:32:12,500 --> 01:32:14,500
- What?
- And the sash...

1785
01:32:15,500 --> 01:32:17,500
It sucks.

1786
01:32:19,100 --> 01:32:21,100
But that hair...

1787
01:32:21,800 --> 01:32:24,200
- It's like a co-op
for parakeets.

1788
01:32:24,300 --> 01:32:25,800
What?

1789
01:32:25,900 --> 01:32:28,200
Look... Hannah...

1790
01:32:28,300 --> 01:32:30,900
I pride myself with
being honest...

1791
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:32,100
with everybody.

1792
01:32:32,200 --> 01:32:35,300
But there's somebody
I've been lying...

1793
01:32:35,400 --> 01:32:37,900
to for a very long
time. Myself.

1794
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:41,800
Because the truth it's...
It's scary.

1795
01:32:42,500 --> 01:32:46,400
And 10 years ago I got in bed
with the wrong girl.

1796
01:32:46,500 --> 01:32:49,400
She turned out to be
the right one.

1797
01:32:55,700 --> 01:32:57,700
I love you, Hannah.

1798
01:32:58,400 --> 01:33:02,200
I always have...
And I always will.

1799
01:33:04,400 --> 01:33:06,400
Thomas Bailey...

1800
01:33:06,600 --> 01:33:10,500
You are the worst Maid
of Honor of all time.

1801
01:33:36,600 --> 01:33:38,600
Oh, no.

1802
01:33:51,200 --> 01:33:53,000
I'm...

1803
01:33:53,100 --> 01:33:55,100
So...

1804
01:33:57,500 --> 01:33:59,700
Very, truly, sorry.

1805
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:09,200
I don't expect you to
ever forgive me.

1806
01:34:13,400 --> 01:34:15,400
Just so you know...

1807
01:34:16,600 --> 01:34:18,900
You are the perfect guy.

1808
01:34:21,200 --> 01:34:23,800
Just not the perfect guy
for me.

1809
01:34:36,900 --> 01:34:38,900
Goodbye, Hannah.

1810
01:34:40,900 --> 01:34:42,900
Colin...

1811
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:49,700
- What did she say?
- She said I should dick you.

1812
01:34:49,800 --> 01:34:52,200
Oh yeah, that makes sense...

1813
01:34:55,200 --> 01:34:57,200
Arsehole.

1814
01:35:11,800 --> 01:35:12,800
- I do.

1815
01:35:12,900 --> 01:35:14,500
And Tom, do you take Hannah...

1816
01:35:14,600 --> 01:35:17,000
- to be your lawfully
wedded wife?

1817
01:35:17,100 --> 01:35:18,600
I do.

1818
01:35:18,700 --> 01:35:20,700
Now, this is the moment.

1819
01:35:23,500 --> 01:35:27,000
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

1820
01:35:27,100 --> 01:35:30,200
At last... You may
kiss your bride.

1821
01:35:55,600 --> 01:35:57,600
Oh my God.

1822
01:35:57,700 --> 01:35:59,700
- Number six?
- Seven.

1823
01:36:01,300 --> 01:36:04,700
You're absolutely glowing
tonight, grandma Pearl.

1824
01:36:04,800 --> 01:36:09,800
Thank you. It's very
nice of you to say so.

1825
01:36:21,100 --> 01:36:23,100
What are you doing?

1826
01:36:25,300 --> 01:36:27,900
I'm just making sure I got
the right girl this time.

1827
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:31,600
You do.
Definitely.

1828
01:36:36,400 --> 01:36:41,300
- Oh, Monica...
- Oh, Bill...
