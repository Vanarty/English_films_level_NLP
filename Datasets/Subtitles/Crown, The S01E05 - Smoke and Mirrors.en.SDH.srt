00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:32,000
-[knocking at door]
-Yes.

4
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,200
Ah, there you are. Come in.

5
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,560
I'm practicing for the big day tomorrow
and I need an Archbishop.

6
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,840
Will you do me the honour? From here.

7
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:05,920
"Is Your Majesty willing
to take the oath?"

8
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:08,240
I am...

9
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,640
willing.

10
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,720
"Will you maintain and preserve in...

11
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,080
invi..."

12
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,920
Ah. Inviolably.

13
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,920
It means... to make a promise
you can... you can never break.

14
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:36,040
A very sacred promise indeed.

15
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,000
-[knocking at door]
-Yes!

16
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,560
-We're ready for you, sir.
-Oh, not yet, Tommy.

17
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,120
We haven't even reached the anointing.

18
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,440
You have to anoint me,
otherwise, I can't...

19
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,040
be King.

20
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,440
Do you understand?

21
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,840
When the holy oil touches me,

22
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:10,520
I am tr... I am transformed.

23
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:17,920
Brought into direct contact
with the divine.

24
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,800
For... forever changed.

25
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,640
Bound to God.

26
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,440
It is the most important part
of the entire ceremony.

27
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,400
So we had better practice,
hadn't we, archbishop?

28
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:46,240
"Be thy hands, anointed, with holy oil.

29
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:56,240
Be thy breast, anointed, with holy oil.

30
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:12,440
Be thy head, anointed, with holy oil.

31
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:18,760
As kings, priests and prophets
were anointed."

32
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:33,640
-Goodness. That's very heavy indeed.
-Five pounds, sir.

33
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:39,200
Not to mention the, uh,
symbolic weight, hm?

34
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,680
There's a sight I hoped I'd never see.

35
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,120
It's not as easy as it looks.

36
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,040
That's exactly what the King said.

37
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,320
I remember.

38
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:52,480
Do you suppose I could borrow it
for a couple of days?

39
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,800
Just to practice.

40
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,720
Borrow it, ma'am? From whom?

41
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,160
If it's not yours, whose is it?

42
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,640
[Charles] Be quiet, Anne.

43
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:34,840
[whispers] Ready?

44
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:45,040
Close your eyes,
and don't open them until I say so.

45
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,440
-Oh, any idea where the Duke is?
-His Royal Highness went flying, ma'am.

46
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,080
[Anne] Daddy?

47
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,160
Again?

48
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,360
So when's the big day?

49
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,040
Pilot's exam? Two weeks.

50
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,160
-Are you still on track for the record?
-I am. Just.

51
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,480
-If I do nothing else.
-Oh, then you'll hate me.

52
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,720
Why?

53
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,920
There was something
I wanted you to help me with.

54
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,920
It would've to be jolly important
to distract me

55
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,840
from getting my wings faster than anyone
in British aviation history.

56
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:30,760
It is. I'd like you to come aboard
my Coronation Committee.

57
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:37,280
-In which capacity?
-As Chairman.

58
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,800
But you already have one. Bernard.

59
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,080
I'd ask the Duke of Norfolk
to make room for you.

60
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,040
I want to make a public declaration
of my trust in you.

61
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,800
-There's no need to matronize me.
-I'm not matronizing you.

62
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,760
Yes, you are. You're taking pity on me

63
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,080
and giving me a job,
for appearance's sake.

64
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,680
No, it's not that.

65
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:58,240
I was just thinking how I'd like us
to spend more time together.

66
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,680
What are you talking about?
We spend all our time together.

67
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:04,720
No, we don't. You're always off flying,
or lunching with strange men.

68
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,800
A few hours a week, darling.
Anyway, what else am I supposed to do?

69
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:10,120
Sit around and wait for you
while you're Queening?

70
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:13,000
-Queening?
-Yes. Queening.

71
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,800
Maybe I'd like your help
with the Queening.

72
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,800
Oh, in the same flattering way
you asked me to redecorate Clarence House?

73
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:21,080
-Well, you did that jolly well.
-I felt like a sissy.

74
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,400
Fussing about curtain fabrics
and paint charts.

75
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,720
Honestly,
it's just queening of another sort.

76
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,840
[chuckling]

77
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,080
What would it entail?

78
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:41,320
Well,
the Duke of Norfolk will run the show

79
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:44,800
from an organizational perspective,
look after the seating,

80
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,560
the root of the procession,
but as Chairman of the Committee,

81
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:52,080
you would have an input on ideas,
inspire everyone, lead them.

82
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,560
They won't listen to me.
The grey, old men?

83
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,160
The men with moustaches? They hate me.

84
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,240
[cheering]

85
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,640
-They do not hate you.
-They do.

86
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,240
They treat me as an outsider.

87
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,520
An irrelevance. Everyone does.

Total control or nothing at all.
Those are my terms.

92

All right.

93
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:42,560
-[laughs]
-But don't go mad.

94
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,800
-What does that mean?
-It means just don't go mad.

95
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,960
It's the Coronation.

96
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,440
A service which goes back
a thousand years.

00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:25,880
Miss...?

104
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:28,280
[journalist] You must have been thrilled,
Your Highness.

105
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,640
-Not Your Highness.
-Oh.

106
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,760
-Sore point.
-Just a Duchess.

107
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,640
Not H.R.H. So, "Ma'am."

108
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,560
-Ma'am?
-Or, "Your Grace".

109
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,400
What made you choose
this particular house?

110
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,760
It has a two-acre park,
which gives us privacy.

111
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,400
And its size means the Duke and I
can finally entertain properly

112
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,480
and we very much enjoy entertaining.

113
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,040
The Duchess is so very good at it.

114
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,360
I believe our editor agreed
as part of the deal

115
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,440
that you would give our readers
some tips for entertaining?

116
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:06,960
-Did we agree that?
-We did, darling, yes. They paid extra.

117
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:08,720
Hmm.

118
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,840
Okay. Big smiles.

119
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,400
Perfect.

120
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,200
[David] But having had a naval background,

121
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:20,440
I don't much care
for fussy things or smells,

122
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:24,280
but I do like a good, well-milled soap.

123
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,600
What sartorial tips
would you give the young men of today?

124
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:36,040
No matter what the fashion,
a well-cut suit in a beautiful fabric

125
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,800
will take you anywhere.

126
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,040
Is that the sort of thing
you're looking for?

127
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,880
You're very fortunate.

128
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:53,520
He lets no one in here,
it's his private room. Full of secrets.

129
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,040
Not secrets, darling.
Memories, precious memories.

130
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:03,200
I come in here
for a few moments every day

131
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:08,080
to meditate and remember.

132
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:13,360
-Goodness. Bagpipes, too?
-Yes, I play.

133
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,040
When he gets homesick.

134
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:20,160
My favourite armchair.

135
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,640
-And the briefcase?
-Box.

136
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:29,840
As Monarch, one receives a daily red box
from the government.

137
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:36,480
State papers, business of the day.
Matters requiring royal assent.

138
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:43,320
That was the final box I received as King.
It contained my abdication papers.

139
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:49,240
And all these photographs of you as King,
there are none with the crown.

140
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:52,640
-Why is that?
-Well, I never made it that far.

141
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:01,120
I never had a coronation.

142
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:12,240
I forgot to mention,
I had a call today from Sir John Weir.

143
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,240
-[Wallis] Who?
-My mother's doctor.

144
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:22,680
Telling me that, in his opinion,
she was in her final days now,

145
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:26,080
and my sister and I
should make our way over.

146
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,600
With me?

147
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,280
Probably best without.

148
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,640
Even if she dies?

149
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,240
Let's hope she does.

150
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,040
Couldn't bear to go over twice.

151
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,640
I shall have to be brave.

152
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,920
My darling one.

153
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:02,960
And go without you.

154
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,240
To cold London.

155
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,840
Brutal London.

156
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,800
Hellish London.

157
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,960
Shall we fuck?

158
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,320
[both laugh softly]

[Equerry] <i>The Lord Great Chamberlain,</i>
<i>the Lord Chamberlain,</i>

160
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:51,040
<i>the Marshall of the Diplomatic Corp</i>
<i>and the Comptroller, Your Majesty.</i>

161
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:54,800
I have asked you to join me
because I have made a decision

162
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,640
regarding the Coronation Committee,

163
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:01,280
which is that I would like my husband
to be the Chairman of that Committee.

164
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:11,240
That's impossible, ma'am.
There can only be one Chairman.

165
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:14,560
As far as I'm aware,
I only have one husband.

166
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:17,520
And the Duke of Norfolk
will be expecting it to be him.

167
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,240
-He is the Earl Marshall.
-That may be.

168
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,240
And the Chief Butler of England,

169
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,840
he would be the 16th Duke of Norfolk
to do it.

170
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:31,360
He ran your father's coronation,
his father ran your grandfather's.

171
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,280
And running the coronation,
it's what the Norfolks do.

172
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:41,680
-Couldn't you give Philip some other job?
-Like what?

173
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,440
Arrange the photographer?

174
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:55,520
The chairmanship is what he wants.
With full autonomy.

175
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,120
Therefore, it is what I want.

176
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,640
-Norfolk can be vice-chair.
-Why don't you think about it?

177
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,560
I have, and my decision stands.

178
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,640
Thank you.

179
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,280
[Lascelles] Of course,
the Duke of Norfolk will be furious.

180
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:20,360
[Queen Mother] Yes,
and Bernard does fury so well.

181
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,840
What would Your Majesty suggest?

182
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:28,320
I will throw my hat in with Bernard
and sanity will prevail.

183
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,640
The Queen is young.

184
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:34,040
And has to learn
what any young general has to learn.

185
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,120
Namely?

186
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,040
Which battles to fight and which to leave.

187
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:44,840
-Let me know what you want me to do.
-The same as always, Tommy.

188
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,840
Exactly as I tell you.

189
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:53,280
Now, I've spoken
to the Archbishop of Canterbury

190
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:57,600
who's agreed to help us
with our other delicate matter.

191
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,160
The Duke of Windsor.

192
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,640
-When does he arrive?
-This afternoon, I believe.

193
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,840
God help us.

194
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,640
-And when will you meet him?
-We thought tomorrow, ma'am.

195
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,360
Good. Sooner the better.

196
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:16,480
-Be sure to be firm, Tommy.
-Yes, ma'am.

197
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:19,880
That one's like mercury.
He'll slip through the tiniest crack.

198
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,200
[reporters clamour]

199
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:28,320
[David] <i>Good afternoon.</i>

200
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:33,800
<i>I have returned to London</i>
<i>to visit my mother, Queen Mary,</i>

201
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:39,480
who I'm delighted to say has made
such good improvement in recent days.

202
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,200
Thank you very much.

203
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,160
[David]<i> My dearest, darling one...</i>

204
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:05,360
<i>London is as awful and hellish</i>

205
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:09,240
<i>and as full of my smug,</i>
<i>stinking relations as ever.</i>

206
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,720
<i>Each day I call on Mama in the afternoon,</i>

207
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:17,920
<i>and although she doesn't look quite</i>
<i>as bad as the doctors warned me,</i>

208
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,880
<i>she'll never again</i>
<i>be able to leave her rooms,</i>

209
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,760
<i>far less go out in public.</i>

210
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,960
[Queen Mary muttering]

211
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,520
What?

212
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,760
Don't go.

213
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,920
Not going anywhere, Mummy.

214
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,440
Good.

215
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,360
[David]<i> It's one of the hardest things</i>
<i>I've ever had to endure.</i>

216
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:02,640
<i>Spending so much time with a woman</i>
<i>who has been so vicious</i>

217
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:06,560
<i>and inhumane to you, my beloved,</i>
<i>is wearing me down.</i>

218
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,840
-[knocking on door]
-Come in.

219
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,920
-Sorry to disturb, Your Royal Highness.
-What is it?

220
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,040
The Archbishop of Canterbury's
private secretary called, sir.

221
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,840
Requesting a meeting
between you and His Grace.

222
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,520
Oh? What about?

223
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:29,000
Didn't say, sir.
He hoped you could make tomorrow.

224
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:35,120
Fine, I have a few errands planned,
but the Archbishop can come to lunch.

225
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,520
As a matter of fact,
they suggested 4 p.m.

226
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:43,240
-Well, alright. We'll give him tea.
-At Lambeth Palace.

227
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,240
Of course.

228
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:52,760
Now I'm no longer King, I go to them.

229
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,640
-Thank you.
-Good night, Your Royal Highness.

230
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,640
[choirboys shout playfully]

231
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,920
His Royal Highness,
the Duke of Windsor, Your Grace.

232
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,080
[David] Goodness. What is this?

233
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:43,360
-An ambush?
-[Archbishop] Not at all, sir.

234
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,840
No, just a gathering of old friends
who have come together

235
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:50,400
to appeal to you in person,

236
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:56,440
in the hope that you will do
what we all think... would be...

237
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,440
The right thing.

238
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,120
-Regarding what?
-The coronation.

239
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,760
What about the coronation?

240
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,240
We acknowledge...

241
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:17,520
as a...

242
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:24,360
as a member of the Queen's close family,
you are entitled to attend,

243
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:31,360
but also feel that the attendance
at this sacred ceremony

244
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,440
by one who, however good his reasons,

245
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:40,640
did not feel... capable of undertaking

246
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,040
the obligations himself...

247
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:50,840
It could strike a wrong note
and would be deeply upsetting.

248
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,240
To whom?

249
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:55,160
-[Lascelles] To everyone concerned.
-I didn't ask you, Tommy.

250
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:00,720
This is Cookie's work, isn't it?
The Queen Mother's?

251
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:03,400
It's got her pudgy little fingers
all over it.

252
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:08,560
She asked you to do her dirty work for her
and you agreed, Archbishop, shame on you.

253
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,760
I will attend if I want.
And I do want and so does my wife.

254
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:15,120
Alas, no, sir.

255
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:19,720
Of course the Royal Family is obliged
to extend an invitation to you,

256
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:20,840
as a Royal Duke.

257
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:24,800
But that obligation does not extend
to the Duchess of Windsor.

258
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:28,600
And it is my duty to inform you
on behalf of the Royal Family

259
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:32,560
and the government, with whom
we have worked in close consultation,

260
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:36,600
that she will not be offered
an invitation.

261
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,120
Oh, that's madness.

262
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:46,000
The pusillanimity and vindictiveness
knows no limits.

263
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:50,160
Seventeen years have elapsed
since the abdication.

264
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,400
Shouldn't bygones be bygones?

265
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,600
[Lascelles]
Some things can never be forgotten.

266
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,480
Which of us, for example,
has forgotten the Somme?

267
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:04,480
You would compare the love
and public commitment I made to my wife

268
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:07,040
to slaughter in a world war?

269
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:31,320
Why not use a celebration such as this,

270
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:35,040
the investiture of a new sovereign,
a beautiful young child,

271
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:39,920
symbol of modernity, change and progress,
to turn a page?

272
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:44,320
Surely the sophistication of a society

273
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,840
can be measured by its tolerance
and ability to forgive.

274
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:52,920
Its weakness, too.
Sometimes lines just need to be drawn.

275
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,640
You know, Tommy, you're an embarrassment
to the institution you serve,

276
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:00,000
and to the country
that institution serves in turn.

277
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:03,960
And I will take a lecture on national
embarrassment from many people, sir,

278
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,840
but not from you.

279
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:10,160
Let's face it,
this whole thing is a charade.

280
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,320
You knew already the answer to the choice
you have given me.

281
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,920
It is simply the same as the choice
that caused all this offense

282
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,080
in the first place.

283
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:22,400
Namely, would I do anything that excludes
or disrespects the woman I love?

284
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:26,360
No, never. I will therefore
not be attending the coronation

285
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,680
of my own niece.

286
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:31,000
Whose favourite uncle I have always been.

287
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:34,080
Hers, you should know,
was one of the strongest voices involved.

288
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,640
Oh, was it indeed?

289
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:38,440
Well, we know from where
she gets that ice in her veins.

290
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:41,000
And it wasn't from my own dear,
weak brother.

291
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:43,880
[Lascelles] Nothing weak
about the late King, sir.

292
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:47,600
I'm sure I speak for everyone present
when I call him a hero.

293
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:48,880
Hear, hear.

294
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:54,640
"My Lord, Archbishop,

295
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,400
what a scold you are.

296
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:00,800
And when your man is down,
how very bold you are.

297
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:07,880
Of Christian charity, how very scant
you are, you Auld Lang Swine,

298
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,480
-how full of cant you are."
-[protests]

299
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:18,000
A rhyme composed for your perfidious
predecessor at the time of my abdication.

300
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:21,880
I find the sentiment
oddly applicable to you, too.

301
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:42,200
If I were to release a statement,
could you have a look over it?

302
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,320
Of course, sir.

303
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:49,720
I'm aware that it's normal
for no reigning monarchs

304
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:53,680
to be present at a coronation.

305
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:58,480
Perhaps we could extend that
to include former kings too.

306
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,360
To spare my blushes.

307
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:03,560
Might just throw
some of the vultures off the scent.

308
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,040
It's an elegant solution, sir.

309
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:13,840
And I'm quite sure Cabinet
will support it. Tommy?

310
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,440
I'll speak to Their Majesties
and get back to you.

311
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,920
We've just had a call
from Marlborough House.

312
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,680
Regarding her Majesty, Queen Mary.

313
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:41,240
[David]<i> My own darling sweetheart.</i>

314
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,320
<i>Well, at last it's all over.</i>

315
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,840
<i>Mama took ill in the afternoon,</i>

316
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:50,360
<i>then began haemorrhaging</i>
<i>in the early hours.</i>

317
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:54,520
<i>Doctors plied her</i>
<i>with tranquilizers and morphine</i>

318
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:57,240
<i>to ensure there was no suffering.</i>

319
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:59,560
<i>In the end, she passed in her sleep.</i>

320
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,160
<i>I was sad, of course,</i>

321
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:06,640
<i>but let's not forget</i>
<i>how she clung to such hatred for me,</i>

322
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,120
<i>her eldest, till the last.</i>

323
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:14,600
<i>I'm afraid her blood ran as icy cold</i>
<i>when she was alive</i>

324
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:16,800
<i>as it does now she's dead.</i>

325
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,040
<i>Later in the day,</i>
<i>all the members of the family assembled</i>

326
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:25,640
<i>to identify which of her personal</i>
<i>possessions they would most like.</i>

327
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,040
Not entirely.

328
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:30,880
<i>I told Shirley Temple</i>
<i>what I had my eye on.</i>

329
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,480
<i>Because I shan't be there</i>
<i>when the jackals descend</i>

330
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,560
<i>I don't suppose it will do much good.</i>

331
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:41,120
<i>What a vile, tawdry rabble</i>
<i>my relatives are</i>

332
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:45,880
<i>and what a sad, desiccated bunch of</i>
<i>hyenas most of them have become.</i>

333
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,120
<i>But I'm tired of talking about it.</i>

334
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:55,600
<i>I yearn for our perfect life together,</i>

335
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:58,720
<i>away from the snarling</i>
<i>and the sniping of the Court.</i>

336
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:02,520
<i>I adore you, my sweetheart,</i>

337
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:05,840
<i>more deeply than you will ever realize,</i>

338
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:08,520
<i>and I am furiously mad</i>
<i>that you aren't here with me</i>

339
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,920
<i>as you ought by right to be.</i>

340
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,640
[Archbishop] While Queen Mary lived,

341
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:23,360
something of the great reigns
of Queen Victoria and George V

342
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:26,960
seemed to live on with her.

343
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:32,960
Proving that character is,
as it will remain,

344
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:35,720
the essential strength
of British Monarchy.

345
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:41,280
Wherever she went,
she was assured of an applause

346
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:47,280
which sprang from some
deep-seated affection and respect.

347
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:51,200
Have you noticed?
Identical to the funeral of your father.

348
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:53,760
Nothing different. Not one detail.

349
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,040
Not one guest.

350
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:00,560
And she always regarded herself

351
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:06,640
as a servant of our country,
which she served to the end.

352
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:10,560
No sooner does someone in the family
pop their clogs, they ask themselves:

353
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,960
"Right. How was it done last time?

354
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:14,480
Then let's do it
exactly the same way again." I mean...

355
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:21,440
Meanwhile, the people who have come
to share in it are locked outside.

356
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,680
I'm not going to let your coronation
be like this.

357
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:27,640
You're a young woman. Symbol of a new era.

358
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:32,200
In a fast-changing, modern world.

359
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,960
And I think your coronation
should reflect that.

360
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:42,160
-[whispers] Sorry.
-...Almighty God of his great mercy.

361
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,320
Sorry, darling.

362
00:29:53,800 --> 00:30:00,120
[Archbishop] Earth to earth,
ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

363
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:06,240
In sure and certain hope
of the resurrection to eternal life

364
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:11,400
through our Lord Jesus Christ,
who changed our vile body

365
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:14,680
that it may be like
unto his glorious body...

366
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:23,880
Ladies and gentlemen...

367
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:27,040
[muttering]

368
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,360
[knocking on door]

369
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,640
We should go.

370
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:05,120
Good morning.

371
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,400
Head's up.

372
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:15,440
What is the collective noun
for a group of stuffy old Etonians?

373
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:20,240
A herd? A pack?

374
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:22,800
A school? [chuckles]

375
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:43,760
Thank you.

376
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:50,280
Gentlemen,

377
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:53,840
I'd like to start by saying
how very honoured I feel

378
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:58,360
to be working with all the great minds
and talents here in this room today

379
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:03,360
as we come together to organize
the very best coronation for my wife,

380
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,440
the Queen.

381
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:09,360
We all know the scale of the challenge
that faces us.

382
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:13,160
The eyes of the world will be on us,
Britain will be on show

383
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:16,840
and we must put our best foot forward.

384
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:22,040
In such circumstances, the temptation

385
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:24,800
is to roll out the red carpet
and follow the precedents

386
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:29,960
set by the grand
and successful coronations of the past.

387
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:33,600
But looking to the past
for our inspiration

388
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,600
would be a mistake in my view.

389
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:40,000
Britain today
is not the Britain of past coronations.

390
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:43,120
Assumptions made at the time
of my father-in-law's coronation

391
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:46,440
17 years ago cannot be made anymore.

392
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,400
That is why I think
we should adapt this ceremony.

393
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:57,200
Make it less ostentatious.
More egalitarian.

394
00:32:57,280 --> 00:33:00,400
Show more respect
and sensitivity to the real world.

395
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:03,920
We have a new sovereign,
young and a woman.

396
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,560
Let us give her
a coronation that is befitting

397
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:11,120
of the wind of change that she represents,

398
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,880
modern and forward-looking
at a moment in time

399
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,040
where exciting technological developments

400
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,880
are making things possible
we never dreamt of.

401
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:22,000
Which brings me to my next point...

402
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:38,120
It's an unconscionable vulgarization.

403
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:46,400
How close are you proposing
that these cameras get?

404
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:49,000
They will be kept
at a very discreet distance.

405
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:51,040
No, no close-ups, sir?

406
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,240
Zoom lenses.

407
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:58,520
Oh, no, it will all be done
with the greatest sensitivity

408
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:01,520
and respect for the occasion.

409
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:15,360
But I have had one or two broader thoughts
about the service itself.

410
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:20,720
What?

411
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,320
We can both see what's going on here.

412
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,320
A young couple are playing marital games

413
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:42,760
with the most cherished parts
of our history and pageantry.

414
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:48,200
Our Queen wouldn't agree with a single one
of these radical proposals,

415
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,560
television being just the tip
of the iceberg.

416
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:57,400
She's simply trying to keep peace
in her own bed chamber

417
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:00,520
by promoting her husband
and keeping him happy and occupied

418
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,080
and virile.

419
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:09,960
-That's what's going on here, Winston.
-Why? What else has he proposed?

420
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,800
-Prime Minister.
-Your Majesty.

421
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:37,440
Please tell me this has nothing to do
with my husband.

422
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,800
I told him not to go mad.

423
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:46,960
No one is questioning
the Duke of Edinburgh's motives

424
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:49,560
or the sincerity of his beliefs.

425
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:52,080
I see. He went mad.

426
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:58,480
The changes he is proposing
to an ancient, sacred,

427
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:02,080
never previously changed
liturgy and text...

428
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,040
It went from top to toe.

429
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:11,480
And if it were just a business,
it would be applauded.

430
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:14,360
But this isn't a business. It's the Crown.

431
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:19,040
And one has to ask oneself...

432
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:25,200
What is the purpose of the Crown?
What is the purpose of the monarchy?

433
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,080
Does the Crown bend
to the will of the people

434
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:30,120
to be audited and accountable?

435
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:34,720
Or should it remain
above temporal matters?

436
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,600
What say you?

437
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:49,360
No, ma'am. What say you?

438
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,840
The decision is yours to make.

439
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:56,600
We will take our lead from you.

440
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:41,040
We just wondered if you might be available
for a brief moment in the vestry.

441
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:44,720
Alright.

442
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:57,840
-What is this? Hide and seek?
-I told you not to overstep the mark.

443
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,920
I made it clear,
carte blanche or nothing at all.

444
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,840
Trade Unionists and businessmen?
In the Abbey?

445
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:06,800
-If you want to stay on the throne, yes.
-In a trimmed-down televised coronation?

446
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:09,680
If you want to avoid a revolution, yes.
You forget.

447
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:13,040
I have seen first-hand what it is like
for a royal family to be overthrown

448
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:14,920
because they were out of step
with the people.

449
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,160
I left Greece in an orange crate.
My father would have been killed.

450
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:21,240
My grandfather was.
I'm just trying to protect you.

451
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:23,400
From whom? The British people?

452
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:25,600
You have no idea who they are
or what they want.

453
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:30,200
Oh, oh, I'm just Johnny Foreigner, again,
who doesn't understand. Fine, fine.

454
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:32,520
You want a big overblown ceremony
costing a fortune

455
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:35,400
while the rest of the country
is on rations, have it.

456
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,360
But don't come bleating to me

457
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:40,520
when your head and the heads
of our children are on spikes.

458
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:43,640
If the people are hungry,
they want something that lifts them up.

459
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:47,960
And how do you propose lifting them
if they cannot see it?

460
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:50,840
The people look to a monarchy
for something bigger than themselves.

461
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:52,880
An inspiration. A higher ideal.

462
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,680
If you put it in their homes,

463
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:56,960
allow them to watch it
with their dinner on their laps.

464
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:00,600
It will democratize it, make them feel
that they share in it. Understand it.

465
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:01,880
Alright!

466
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:06,200
Alright.
I'll support you in the televising.

467
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:11,480
You won't regret it.

468
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:13,760
On one condition.

469
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,680
That you kneel.

470
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:34,040
-Who told you?
-My Prime Minister.

471
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:38,000
-He said you intended to refuse.
-I merely asked the question.

472
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:40,800
Whether it was right in this day and age
that the Queen's consort,

473
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:45,440
her husband, should kneel to her
rather than stand beside her.

474
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,680
You won't be kneeling to me.

475
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,960
That's not how it will look.
That's not how it will feel.

476
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:52,840
It will feel like a eunuch,
an amoeba, is kneeling before his wife.

477
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:55,760
You'll be kneeling before God
and the Crown as we all do.

478
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,400
I don't see you kneeling before anyone.

479
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:59,960
Because I'm already flattened
under the weight of this thing.

480
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:02,720
Oh, spare me the false humility.
Doesn't look like that to me.

481
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,280
-How does it look to you?
-Looks to me like you're enjoying it.

482
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:08,280
It's released an unattractive sense
of authority and entitlement

483
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:09,680
that I have never seen before.

484
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:12,680
In you, it's released a weakness
and insecurity I've never seen before.

485
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:15,400
-Are you my wife or my Queen?
-I'm both.

486
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:17,600
I want to be married to my wife.

487
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:20,200
I am both and a strong man
would be able to kneel to both.

488
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:22,800
-I will not kneel before my wife.
-Your wife is not asking you to.

489
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,240
-But my Queen commands me?
-Yes.

490
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,320
I beg you make an exception for me.

491
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:32,880
No.

492
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:23,120
Come on, they'll be here soon!

493
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:30,920
[Wallis] David, you're our host, darling.

494
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,000
Be right there.

495
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:39,960
[in French]<i> For the sixth time</i>
<i>in the history of England,</i>

496
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:44,560

500
00:41:54,000 --> 00:42:01,000
[David] Alright, everyone. She's arriving.
In the dreaded Gold State Coach.

501
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:06,560
Made in the 1760s and the most
uncomfortable ride known to man.

502
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:08,640
[laughter]

503
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:14,400
[producer] Final checks, please,
gentlemen.

00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:17,440
-West door.
-West door, sir.

00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:20,200
-Triforium.
