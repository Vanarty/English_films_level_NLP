1
00:01:50,703 --> 00:01:52,819
13 meters. You should see it.

2
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:07,851
Okay, take her up and over the bow rail.

3
00:02:09,298 --> 00:02:12,499
Okay, Mir-2, we're going over the bow.
Stay with us.

4
00:02:45,381 --> 00:02:47,372
Okay, quiet. We're rolling.

5
00:02:48,016 --> 00:02:51,377
Seeing her coming out of the darkness
like a ghost ship ...

6
00:02:51,458 --> 00:02:53,372
still gets me every time.

7
00:02:54,502 --> 00:02:57,729
To see the sad ruin of the great ship,
sitting here ...

8
00:02:58,544 --> 00:03:02,898
where she landed at 2:30 in the morning
of April 15, 1912 ...

9
00:03:03,381 --> 00:03:05,178
after her long fall ...

10
00:03:06,021 --> 00:03:07,739
from the world above.

11
00:03:08,341 --> 00:03:10,457
You're so full of shit, boss.

12
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,369
Dive 6.

13
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:43,292
Here we are again on the deck of Titanic.

14
00:03:43,379 --> 00:03:45,290
2½ miles down.

15
00:03:45,819 --> 00:03:47,969
3,821 meters.

16
00:03:49,219 --> 00:03:52,848
The pressure outside
is 3½ tons per square inch.

17
00:03:52,939 --> 00:03:55,658
These windows are 9 inches thick
and if they go ...

18
00:03:55,739 --> 00:03:58,048
it's sayonara in 2 microseconds.

19
00:03:58,779 --> 00:04:01,168
All right, enough of that bullshit.

20
00:04:14,539 --> 00:04:17,689
Just put her down on the roof
of the officers' quarters like yesterday.

21
00:04:17,778 --> 00:04:18,767
Sure.

22
00:04:19,058 --> 00:04:21,936
Okay, Mir-2, we're landing
right over the Grand Staircase.

23
00:04:22,018 --> 00:04:23,815
You guys set to launch?

24
00:04:24,018 --> 00:04:26,851
Yeah, Brock, launching Dunkin now.
Go, Charlie.

25
00:04:34,698 --> 00:04:36,734
- All right, tether out.
- Tether out.

26
00:04:37,098 --> 00:04:40,056
Okay, Brock,
we're dropping down along the hull.

27
00:04:42,618 --> 00:04:46,769
Yeah, roger that. Okay, drop down,
and go into the first-class gangway door.

28
00:04:46,857 --> 00:04:51,055
I want you guys working the "D" deck
reception area and the dining saloon.

29
00:04:51,697 --> 00:04:52,971
Copy that.

30
00:04:58,577 --> 00:04:59,692
- Tether out.
- Tether out.

31
00:04:59,777 --> 00:05:01,813
Okay, now left. Now left. Left, left.

32
00:05:10,297 --> 00:05:13,733
Snoop Dog is on the move.
We're headed down the stairwell.

33
00:05:16,777 --> 00:05:18,768
Okay, Lewis, drop down to "B" deck.

34
00:05:18,896 --> 00:05:20,045
"A" deck.

35
00:05:20,136 --> 00:05:22,810
- Give me some rope, Captain.
- "B" deck. Get in there.

36
00:06:00,295 --> 00:06:03,492
- Watch the door frame. Watch it.
- I see it. I got it.

37
00:06:10,015 --> 00:06:11,209
We're good. Just chill, boss.

38
00:06:24,454 --> 00:06:26,172
Okay, make your turn.

39
00:06:27,014 --> 00:06:29,403
- Cable out, Captain.
- Make your turn. Watch the wall.

40
00:06:29,494 --> 00:06:31,883
Brock, we're at the piano. You copy?

41
00:06:32,294 --> 00:06:33,522
Copy that.

42
00:06:41,254 --> 00:06:42,528
Right there.

43
00:06:42,614 --> 00:06:45,572
- That's it. That's the bedroom door.
- I see it.

44
00:06:54,853 --> 00:06:57,845
We're in. We're in, baby. We're there.

45
00:07:00,213 --> 00:07:03,649
That's Hockley's bed.
That's where the son of a bitch slept.

46
00:07:09,293 --> 00:07:11,568
Oops. Somebody left the water running.

47
00:07:11,653 --> 00:07:14,451
Hold it. Just a second.
Go back to the right.

48
00:07:20,573 --> 00:07:22,768
That wardrobe door. Get closer.

49
00:07:23,493 --> 00:07:26,530
- You're smelling something, boss.
- I want to see what's under it.

50
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:28,409
Give me my hands, man.

51
00:07:33,412 --> 00:07:34,640
All right.

52
00:07:35,972 --> 00:07:38,645
- Take it easy. It might come apart.
- Okay.

53
00:07:39,892 --> 00:07:43,202
Okay, go. Flip it over. Go. Turn over.

54
00:07:43,492 --> 00:07:44,925
Keep going. Go.

55
00:07:45,772 --> 00:07:47,251
Okay, drop it.

56
00:07:55,851 --> 00:07:58,365
Oh, baby, baby. Are you seeing this, boss?

57
00:08:01,811 --> 00:08:03,403
It's payday, boys.

58
00:08:18,731 --> 00:08:20,005
Cha-ching!

59
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:23,759
- We did it, Bobby.
- We brought it back.

60
00:08:24,011 --> 00:08:25,205
Oh, yeah! You the man!

61
00:08:25,291 --> 00:08:28,362
Who's the best, baby? Say it.

62
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:30,169
You are, Lewis.

63
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:34,766
- Bobby, my cigar.
- Right here.

64
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:43,929
Okay, crack her open.

65
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:47,485
Let me get around. Hang on.

66
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:48,844
- You getting it?
- Got it.

67
00:09:12,129 --> 00:09:13,198
Shit.

68
00:09:15,249 --> 00:09:16,523
No diamond.

69
00:09:17,769 --> 00:09:19,999
You know, boss,
this same thing happened to Geraldo ...

70
00:09:20,089 --> 00:09:21,647
and his career never recovered.

71
00:09:26,409 --> 00:09:27,762
Turn the camera off.

72
00:09:27,849 --> 00:09:30,966
Brock. The partners would like to know
how it's going.

73
00:09:31,689 --> 00:09:34,839
Hey, Dave. Barry, hi.
Look, it wasn't in the safe.

74
00:09:34,928 --> 00:09:38,318
Don't worry about it. There are
still plenty of places it could be.

75
00:09:38,408 --> 00:09:39,397
Hell, yes.

76
00:09:39,488 --> 00:09:41,843
The floor debris in the suite,
the mother's room ...

77
00:09:41,928 --> 00:09:44,283
- The purser's safe on "C" deck.
- Jimmy Hoffa's briefcase.

78
00:09:44,368 --> 00:09:45,562
A dozen other places.

79
00:09:45,648 --> 00:09:48,879
Guys, look, you just got to trust
my instincts. I know we're close.

80
00:09:48,968 --> 00:09:52,199
We just got to go through
a little process of elimination.

81
00:09:52,888 --> 00:09:54,446
Hang on a second.

82
00:09:57,488 --> 00:10:00,764
- Let me see that.
- We might have something here, guys.

83
00:10:02,887 --> 00:10:06,004
- Where's the photograph of the necklace?
- We'll call you right back.

84
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:18,880
I'll be goddamned.

85
00:10:21,447 --> 00:10:24,564
Treasure hunter Brock Lovett
is best known for finding Spanish gold.

86
00:10:24,647 --> 00:10:27,115
It's okay, I'll feed you in a minute.

87
00:10:27,207 --> 00:10:30,836
He has chartered Russian subs to reach
the most famous shipwreck of all ...

88
00:10:30,927 --> 00:10:32,246
the Titanic.

89
00:10:32,327 --> 00:10:35,842
He's with us live via satellite,
from the research ship Keldysh ...

90
00:10:35,927 --> 00:10:37,201
in the North Atlantic.

91
00:10:37,287 --> 00:10:39,323
- Hello, Brock.
- Hello, Tracy.

92
00:10:39,606 --> 00:10:42,325
Of course, everyone knows
the familiar stories of Titanic.

93
00:10:42,406 --> 00:10:45,796
You know, the nobility of the band
playing to the very end and all that.

94
00:10:45,886 --> 00:10:48,241
But what I'm interested in
are the untold stories ...

95
00:10:48,326 --> 00:10:50,840
the secrets locked deep inside
the hull of Titanic.

96
00:10:50,926 --> 00:10:54,123
And we're out here using robot technology
to go further into the wreck ...

97
00:10:54,206 --> 00:10:55,958
than anybody has ever done before.

98
00:10:56,046 --> 00:10:58,196
Your expedition is at the center
of a storm ...

99
00:10:58,286 --> 00:11:01,164
of controversy over salvage rights,
and even ethics.

100
00:11:01,246 --> 00:11:02,998
Many are calling you a grave-robber.

101
00:11:03,086 --> 00:11:06,203
Nobody ever called the recovery
of the artifacts from King Tut's tomb ...

102
00:11:06,286 --> 00:11:08,356
- What is it?
- Turn that up, dear.

103
00:11:08,446 --> 00:11:11,119
I have museum-trained experts
sent out here making sure ...

104
00:11:11,206 --> 00:11:14,038
that these relics are preserved
and catalogued properly.

105
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:16,958
Take a look at this drawing
that we found just today.

106
00:11:17,045 --> 00:11:20,242
A piece of paper that's been underwater
for 84 years ...

107
00:11:20,325 --> 00:11:23,203
and my team are able to preserve it intact.

108
00:11:23,925 --> 00:11:27,759
Should this have remained unseen
at the bottom of the ocean for eternity?

109
00:11:27,925 --> 00:11:29,278
We can see it and ...

110
00:11:29,365 --> 00:11:30,957
I'll be goddamned.

111
00:11:34,245 --> 00:11:37,123
Brock, there's a satellite call for you.

112
00:11:37,524 --> 00:11:40,756
Bobby, we're launching. See these
submersibles going in the water?

113
00:11:40,844 --> 00:11:43,598
Trust me, buddy,
you want to take this call.

114
00:11:44,604 --> 00:11:46,322
This better be good.

115
00:11:46,804 --> 00:11:50,035
- You got to speak up. She's kind of old.
- Great.

116
00:11:52,364 --> 00:11:54,753
This is Brock Lovett.
How can I help you, Mrs. ...

117
00:11:54,844 --> 00:11:56,596
Calvert. Rose Calvert.

118
00:11:56,884 --> 00:11:58,317
Mrs. Calvert?

119
00:11:59,204 --> 00:12:03,914
I was just wondering if you had found
the "Heart of the Ocean" yet, Mr. Lovett.

120
00:12:06,284 --> 00:12:08,639
Told you you wanted to take the call.

121
00:12:10,004 --> 00:12:12,597
All right, you have my attention, Rose.

122
00:12:12,883 --> 00:12:15,875
Can you tell us who the woman
in the picture is?

123
00:12:15,963 --> 00:12:18,557
Oh, yes. The woman in the picture is me.

124
00:12:34,763 --> 00:12:38,438
She's a goddamn liar!
Some nutcase seeking money or publicity.

125
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:42,758
God only knows why!
Like that Russian babe, Anesthesia.

126
00:12:42,922 --> 00:12:44,435
They're inbound!

127
00:12:49,522 --> 00:12:53,231
Rose Dewitt Bukater died on the Titanic
when she was 17, right?

128
00:12:53,322 --> 00:12:54,437
That's right.

129
00:12:54,522 --> 00:12:57,036
If she had lived, she'd be over 100 by now.

130
00:12:57,122 --> 00:12:59,238
101 next month.

131
00:12:59,442 --> 00:13:02,115
Okay, so she's a very old goddamn liar.

132
00:13:02,402 --> 00:13:04,757
Look, I've already done the background
on this woman ...

133
00:13:04,842 --> 00:13:08,551
all the way back to the '20s,
when she was working as an actress.

134
00:13:08,642 --> 00:13:11,520
An actress.
There's your first clue, Sherlock.

135
00:13:11,762 --> 00:13:16,039
Her name was Rose Dawson back then.
Then she marries this guy named Calvert.

136
00:13:16,121 --> 00:13:19,558
They move to Cedar Rapids
and she punches out a couple of kids.

137
00:13:19,641 --> 00:13:22,599
Now Calvert's dead, and from what I hear,
Cedar Rapids is dead.

138
00:13:22,681 --> 00:13:24,319
And everybody
who knows about the diamond ...

139
00:13:24,401 --> 00:13:27,279
is supposed to be dead or on this boat,
but she knows.

140
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:42,635
Doesn't exactly travel light, does she?

141
00:13:42,721 --> 00:13:44,439
Hurry up, give him a hand!

142
00:13:44,801 --> 00:13:48,077
Mrs. Calvert, I'm Brock Lovett.
Welcome to the Keldysh.

143
00:13:50,001 --> 00:13:51,592
Okay, let's get her inside there.

144
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,432
- Hi, Miss Calvert.
- Hi.

145
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:57,318
- Welcome to the Keldysh.
- Thanks.

146
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,149
Yes?

147
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,437
- Are your staterooms all right?
- Oh, yes, very nice.

148
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,435
Have you met my granddaughter, Lizzy?
She takes care of me.

149
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:19,557
We met just a few minutes ago.
Remember, Nana, up on deck?

150
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,715
Oh, yeah ...

151
00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:25,952
There. That's nice.
Have to have my pictures when I travel.

152
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:29,796
Can I get you anything?
Is there anything you'd like?

153
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:31,154
Yes.

154
00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:33,834
I would like to see my drawing.

155
00:14:47,439 --> 00:14:51,557
Louis XVI wore a fabulous stone
called the Blue Diamond of the Crown.

156
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:54,028
It disappeared in 1792.

157
00:14:54,839 --> 00:14:58,592
About the same time old Louis
lost everything from the neck up.

158
00:14:58,878 --> 00:15:02,268
The theory goes that the
crown diamond was chopped, too.

159
00:15:02,438 --> 00:15:06,750
Re-cut into a heart-like shape that
became known as the "Heart of the Ocean".

160
00:15:06,918 --> 00:15:09,830
Today, it would be worth
more than the Hope Diamond.

161
00:15:09,918 --> 00:15:14,116
It was a dreadful, heavy thing.
I only wore it this once.

162
00:15:14,278 --> 00:15:16,746
You actually think this is you, Nana?

163
00:15:16,878 --> 00:15:18,357
It is me, dear.

164
00:15:19,118 --> 00:15:20,676
Wasn't I a dish?

165
00:15:22,558 --> 00:15:25,196
I tracked it down
through insurance records.

166
00:15:25,277 --> 00:15:28,952
An old claim that was settled
under terms of absolute secrecy.

167
00:15:29,957 --> 00:15:32,676
Can you tell me
who the claimant was, Rose?

168
00:15:32,957 --> 00:15:35,551
I should imagine someone named Hockley.

169
00:15:35,877 --> 00:15:39,108
Nathan Hockley. That's right.
Pittsburgh steel tycoon.

170
00:15:39,917 --> 00:15:44,468
The claim was for a diamond necklace
his son, Caledon, bought his fiancée, you.

171
00:15:45,317 --> 00:15:47,706
A week before he sailed on Titanic.

172
00:15:48,557 --> 00:15:51,071
It was filed right after the sinking.

173
00:15:51,597 --> 00:15:54,747
So the diamond had to have gone down
with the ship.

174
00:15:55,997 --> 00:15:57,396
You see the date?

175
00:15:58,836 --> 00:16:00,394
April 14, 1912.

176
00:16:00,556 --> 00:16:03,275
Which means if your grandmother
is who she says she is ...

177
00:16:03,356 --> 00:16:06,553
she was wearing the diamond
the day the Titanic sank.

178
00:16:06,636 --> 00:16:09,196
And that makes you my new best friend.

179
00:16:10,316 --> 00:16:13,626
These are some of the things
we recovered from your stateroom.

180
00:16:15,836 --> 00:16:17,235
This was mine.

181
00:16:18,716 --> 00:16:20,274
How extraordinary!

182
00:16:21,316 --> 00:16:24,672
And it looks the same as it did
the last time I saw it.

183
00:16:30,116 --> 00:16:32,345
The reflection has changed a bit.

184
00:16:48,515 --> 00:16:50,904
Are you ready to go back to Titanic?

185
00:16:54,315 --> 00:16:57,624
Here we go.
She hits the 'berg on the starboard side.

186
00:16:58,155 --> 00:17:02,750
She kind of bumps along, punching holes
like Morse code along the side ...

187
00:17:02,834 --> 00:17:04,347
below the water line.

188
00:17:04,434 --> 00:17:06,504
Then the forward compartments
start to flood.

189
00:17:06,594 --> 00:17:10,428
Now, as the water level rises,
it spills over the watertight bulkheads ...

190
00:17:10,514 --> 00:17:13,551
which, unfortunately,
don't go any higher than "E" deck.

191
00:17:13,634 --> 00:17:17,786
So now, as the bow goes down,
the stern rises up, slow at first ...

192
00:17:17,874 --> 00:17:22,265
then faster and faster, until finally,
she's got her whole ass sticking in the air.

193
00:17:22,354 --> 00:17:25,744
And that's a big ass.
We're talking 20,000, 30,000 tons.

194
00:17:26,114 --> 00:17:28,674
Okay? And the hull's not designed to deal
with that pressure.

195
00:17:28,754 --> 00:17:32,269
So what happens?
She splits, right down to the keel ...

196
00:17:32,673 --> 00:17:34,869
and the stern falls back level.

197
00:17:35,514 --> 00:17:40,189
Then as the bow sinks, it pulls the stern
vertical and then finally detaches.

198
00:17:41,153 --> 00:17:45,465
Now the stern section kind of bobs there
like a cork for a couple of minutes ...

199
00:17:45,553 --> 00:17:48,147
floods, and finally goes under
about 2:20 am ...

200
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:51,031
2 hours and 40 minutes
after the collision.

201
00:17:51,873 --> 00:17:55,752
The bow section planes away,
landing about a ½ a mile away ...

202
00:17:55,833 --> 00:17:58,745
going 20, 30 knots
when it hits the ocean floor.

203
00:18:02,192 --> 00:18:03,545
Pretty cool, huh?

204
00:18:03,632 --> 00:18:07,420
Thank you for that fine
forensic analysis, Mr. Bodine.

205
00:18:08,912 --> 00:18:11,221
Of course,
the experience of it was —

206
00:18:12,472 --> 00:18:14,303
somewhat different.

207
00:18:15,032 --> 00:18:16,943
Will you share it with us?

208
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:11,461
- I'm taking her to rest.
- No.

209
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:13,467
- Come on, Nana.
- No!

210
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:20,301
Give me the tape recorder.

211
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:23,983
Tell us, Rose.

212
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:27,628
It's been 84 years.

213
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:31,540
It's okay. Just try to remember
anything, anything at all.

214
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:35,188
Do you want to hear this
or not, Mr. Lovett?

215
00:19:39,149 --> 00:19:41,868
It's been 84 years ...

216
00:19:43,669 --> 00:19:46,137
and I can still smell the fresh paint.

217
00:19:48,309 --> 00:19:50,425
The china had never been used.

218
00:19:51,549 --> 00:19:53,938
The sheets had never been slept in.

219
00:19:56,109 --> 00:19:59,465
Titanic was called "The Ship of Dreams".

220
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:02,223
And it was.

221
00:20:03,269 --> 00:20:04,702
It really was.

222
00:20:33,428 --> 00:20:37,580
All third-class passengers
with a forward berth ...

223
00:20:37,668 --> 00:20:40,466
this way, please!
This queue! Right here ...

224
00:20:40,548 --> 00:20:43,540
- It's a big boat, huh?
- Daddy, it's a ship.

225
00:20:43,628 --> 00:20:45,026
You're right.

226
00:21:13,307 --> 00:21:15,901
I don't see what all the fuss is about.

227
00:21:16,146 --> 00:21:18,502
It doesn't look any bigger
than the Mauretania.

228
00:21:18,586 --> 00:21:21,817
You can be blasé about some things,
Rose, but not about Titanic.

229
00:21:21,906 --> 00:21:25,865
It's over 100 feet longer than
Mauretania, and far more luxurious.

230
00:21:25,986 --> 00:21:29,137
Your daughter is far too difficult
to impress, Ruth.

231
00:21:29,306 --> 00:21:31,501
So this is the ship
they say is unsinkable.

232
00:21:31,586 --> 00:21:34,100
It is unsinkable.
God himself could not sink this ship.

233
00:21:34,186 --> 00:21:36,905
Sir, you have to check your baggage
through the main terminal.

234
00:21:36,986 --> 00:21:38,021
It's round that way, sir.

235
00:21:38,106 --> 00:21:40,461
I put my faith in you, good sir.
Now, kindly see my man.

236
00:21:40,546 --> 00:21:43,219
Yes, sir. It's my pleasure, sir.
If I can do anything at all ...

237
00:21:43,306 --> 00:21:44,580
Yes, right.

238
00:21:44,666 --> 00:21:48,419
All the trunks from that car there.
12 from here.

239
00:21:49,186 --> 00:21:53,701
And the safe, to the parlor suite,
rooms B-52, 54, 56.

240
00:21:55,665 --> 00:21:59,021
Ladies, we better hurry. Come along.

241
00:22:03,585 --> 00:22:05,496
- My coat?
- I have it, miss.

242
00:22:05,585 --> 00:22:07,974
Queue here for health inspection.

243
00:22:08,145 --> 00:22:11,694
All third-class passengers
queue here for health inspection.

244
00:22:12,345 --> 00:22:13,539
Chin up.

245
00:22:18,345 --> 00:22:21,017
- Welcome aboard, ma'am.
- Welcome to Titanic.

246
00:22:21,864 --> 00:22:25,413
It was the ship of dreams
to everyone else.

247
00:22:26,064 --> 00:22:28,180
To me, it was a slave ship ...

248
00:22:28,744 --> 00:22:31,463
taking me back to America in chains.

249
00:22:32,504 --> 00:22:36,543
Outwardly, I was everything
a well brought up girl should be.

250
00:22:36,904 --> 00:22:38,974
Inside, I was screaming.

251
00:22:55,144 --> 00:22:58,101
Jack, you are pazzo.
You bet everything we have.

252
00:22:59,103 --> 00:23:01,981
When you got nothing,
you got nothing to lose.

253
00:23:08,703 --> 00:23:09,818
Sven?

254
00:23:10,703 --> 00:23:11,692
Bet.

255
00:23:30,262 --> 00:23:31,251
All right.

256
00:23:31,342 --> 00:23:34,539
Moment of truth.
Somebody's life is about to change.

257
00:23:35,662 --> 00:23:36,777
Brizio?

258
00:23:38,862 --> 00:23:40,261
- Niente.
- Niente.

259
00:23:41,622 --> 00:23:42,691
Olaf?

260
00:23:43,622 --> 00:23:44,771
Nothing.

261
00:23:45,022 --> 00:23:46,057
Sven?

262
00:23:50,382 --> 00:23:51,610
2 pair.

263
00:23:52,182 --> 00:23:53,740
I'm sorry, Fabrizio.

264
00:23:53,821 --> 00:23:55,732
Che sorry, ma vaffanculo!
Did you bet all our money?

265
00:23:55,821 --> 00:23:59,700
I'm sorry, you're not going to
see your mom again for a long time.

266
00:24:00,141 --> 00:24:03,019
'Cause we're going to America.
Full house, boys.

267
00:24:16,461 --> 00:24:17,576
Come on.

268
00:24:18,661 --> 00:24:20,140
I'm going home!

269
00:24:22,781 --> 00:24:25,341
- I'm going home.
- I go to America!

270
00:24:25,981 --> 00:24:27,174
No, mate.

271
00:24:27,421 --> 00:24:30,856
Titanic go to America, in 5 minutes.

272
00:24:31,661 --> 00:24:34,128
Shit, Fabri. Come on. Come on, here.

273
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:39,778
We're riding in high style now.
We're a couple of regular swells.

274
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:42,852
We're practically goddamn royalty,
ragazzo mio.

275
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:44,976
You see? Is my destino.

276
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:48,291
Like I told you,
I go to America to be millionaire.

277
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:54,217
- You are pazzo.
- Maybe, but I've got the tickets.

278
00:24:55,979 --> 00:24:58,288
- I thought you were fast.
- Aspetta!

279
00:24:58,419 --> 00:25:01,093
Wait! Hey, wait!

280
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:03,171
We're passengers! Passengers!

281
00:25:05,259 --> 00:25:07,011
Have you been through
the inspection queue?

282
00:25:07,099 --> 00:25:08,134
Of course.

283
00:25:08,219 --> 00:25:11,370
Anyway, we don't have any lice.
We're Americans, both of us.

284
00:25:11,619 --> 00:25:13,257
Right. Come aboard.

285
00:25:16,779 --> 00:25:20,089
We're the luckiest sons of bitches
in the world. You know that?

286
00:25:28,899 --> 00:25:30,093
Goodbye!

287
00:25:33,539 --> 00:25:36,336
- You know somebody?
- Of course not. That's not the point.

288
00:25:36,418 --> 00:25:38,773
- Goodbye. I'll miss you.
- Goodbye!

289
00:25:38,858 --> 00:25:41,418
- Goodbye.
- I will never forget you!

290
00:26:27,337 --> 00:26:29,055
Come with me, darling. Let's go.

291
00:26:34,017 --> 00:26:35,370
G-60.

292
00:26:35,856 --> 00:26:37,414
Excuse me, ma'am.

293
00:26:40,736 --> 00:26:42,055
Right here.

294
00:26:42,256 --> 00:26:45,407
How you doing? Jack.
Nice to meet you.

295
00:26:45,896 --> 00:26:48,569
Jack Dawson. Nice to meet you.
How you doing?

296
00:26:49,416 --> 00:26:51,566
Who says you get top bunk?

297
00:26:56,936 --> 00:26:59,325
This is your private
promenade deck, sir.

298
00:26:59,416 --> 00:27:02,135
Would you be requiring anything?
Excuse me.

299
00:27:03,056 --> 00:27:04,489
- This one?
- No.

300
00:27:04,776 --> 00:27:06,767
It had a lot of faces on it.

301
00:27:07,775 --> 00:27:09,288
This is the one.

302
00:27:10,616 --> 00:27:12,651
Would you like all of them out, miss?

303
00:27:12,735 --> 00:27:15,408
Yes, we need a little color in this room.

304
00:27:19,175 --> 00:27:20,927
Put it in there. In the wardrobe.

305
00:27:21,575 --> 00:27:23,805
God, not those finger-paintings again.

306
00:27:23,895 --> 00:27:25,692
They certainly were a waste of money.

307
00:27:25,775 --> 00:27:29,051
The difference between Cal's taste
in art and mine is that I have some.

308
00:27:29,135 --> 00:27:30,807
They're fascinating ...

309
00:27:30,935 --> 00:27:33,244
like being inside a dream or something.

310
00:27:33,455 --> 00:27:34,934
There's truth, but no logic.

311
00:27:35,015 --> 00:27:38,006
- What's the artist's name?
- Something Picasso.

312
00:27:38,094 --> 00:27:42,087
Something Picasso. He won't amount
to a thing. He won't, trust me.

313
00:27:42,174 --> 00:27:44,927
- Put the Degas in the bedroom.
- At least they were cheap.

314
00:27:45,574 --> 00:27:47,485
Put it in the wardrobe.

315
00:27:52,134 --> 00:27:56,286
At Cherbourg, a woman came aboard
named Margaret Brown.

316
00:27:56,614 --> 00:27:58,491
We all called her Molly.

317
00:27:58,694 --> 00:28:01,731
History would call her
the "Unsinkable Molly Brown".

318
00:28:01,854 --> 00:28:04,414
I wasn't about to wait
all day for you, sonny.

319
00:28:04,494 --> 00:28:06,689
Here, if you think you can manage.

320
00:28:06,774 --> 00:28:09,765
Her husband had struck gold,
someplace out west.

321
00:28:09,853 --> 00:28:12,812
And she was what mother called
"New Money. "

322
00:28:14,053 --> 00:28:16,851
By the next afternoon,
we were steaming west ...

323
00:28:16,933 --> 00:28:18,924
from the coast of Ireland ...

324
00:28:19,013 --> 00:28:21,766
with nothing out ahead of us but ocean.

325
00:28:27,973 --> 00:28:32,091
Take her to sea, Mr. Murdoch.
Let's stretch her legs.

326
00:28:32,453 --> 00:28:33,681
Yes, sir.

327
00:28:35,813 --> 00:28:38,532
- All ahead full, Mr. Moody.
- Very good, sir.

328
00:28:43,412 --> 00:28:44,892
All ahead full.

329
00:28:45,292 --> 00:28:47,044
All ahead full!

330
00:28:47,452 --> 00:28:49,249
Come on, lads, step lively.

331
00:28:55,652 --> 00:28:57,324
What's the reading?

332
00:29:06,532 --> 00:29:10,002
All right! Let's stoke her right up!
We go full ahead!

333
00:29:10,092 --> 00:29:11,968
Come on, right back to work.

334
00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:06,368
21 knots, sir.

335
00:30:14,969 --> 00:30:16,527
Hey, look!

336
00:30:19,009 --> 00:30:20,283
See it?

337
00:30:23,689 --> 00:30:25,839
There's another one. See him?

338
00:30:35,449 --> 00:30:37,838
Look at that one! Look at him jump!

339
00:31:02,088 --> 00:31:04,727
I can see the Statue of Liberty already.

340
00:31:05,088 --> 00:31:06,806
Very small, of course.

341
00:31:10,048 --> 00:31:12,608
I'm the king of the world!

342
00:31:56,966 --> 00:32:01,118
She's the largest moving object ever made
by the hand of man in all history.

343
00:32:02,326 --> 00:32:06,558
And our master shipbuilder, Mr. Andrews,
here, designed her from the keel plates up.

344
00:32:06,646 --> 00:32:10,355
I may have knocked her together,
but the idea was Mr. Ismay's.

345
00:32:10,646 --> 00:32:13,604
He envisioned a steamer
so grand in scale ...

346
00:32:13,726 --> 00:32:17,639
and so luxurious in its appointments that
its supremacy would never be challenged.

347
00:32:17,726 --> 00:32:21,321
And here she is,
willed into solid reality.

348
00:32:21,406 --> 00:32:22,724
Hear, hear.

349
00:32:23,606 --> 00:32:25,278
The salmon.

350
00:32:28,125 --> 00:32:30,355
You know I don't like that, Rose.

351
00:32:33,805 --> 00:32:35,079
She knows.

352
00:32:37,725 --> 00:32:41,274
We'll both have the lamb.
Rare, with very little mint sauce.

353
00:32:42,485 --> 00:32:44,237
You like lamb, right, sweet pea?

354
00:32:44,325 --> 00:32:45,314
Sausage.

355
00:32:46,645 --> 00:32:49,079
You gonna cut her meat for her,
too, there, Cal?

356
00:32:51,045 --> 00:32:53,684
Hey, who thought of the name Titanic?

357
00:32:54,525 --> 00:32:56,834
- Was it you, Bruce?
- Yes, actually.

358
00:32:57,605 --> 00:32:59,959
I wanted to convey sheer size.

359
00:33:00,164 --> 00:33:02,758
And size means stability, luxury ...

360
00:33:03,204 --> 00:33:05,035
and above all, strength.

361
00:33:06,044 --> 00:33:08,353
Do you know of Dr. Freud, Mr. Ismay?

362
00:33:08,604 --> 00:33:10,799
His ideas about
the male preoccupation with size ...

363
00:33:10,884 --> 00:33:13,239
might be of particular interest to you.

364
00:33:13,884 --> 00:33:15,681
What's gotten into you?

365
00:33:15,764 --> 00:33:16,958
Excuse me.

366
00:33:21,284 --> 00:33:22,717
I do apologize.

367
00:33:22,804 --> 00:33:25,637
She's a pistol, Cal.
Hope you can handle her.

368
00:33:25,764 --> 00:33:28,153
I may have to start minding
what she reads from now on ...

369
00:33:28,244 --> 00:33:29,597
won't I, Mrs. Brown?

370
00:33:29,764 --> 00:33:32,152
Freud, who is he? Is he a passenger?

371
00:33:44,003 --> 00:33:46,039
The ship is nice?

372
00:33:46,123 --> 00:33:47,681
Yeah, it's an Irish ship.

373
00:33:47,763 --> 00:33:49,082
Is English, no?

374
00:33:49,163 --> 00:33:51,802
No, it was built in Ireland.
15,000 Irishmen built this ship.

375
00:33:51,883 --> 00:33:54,272
Solid as a rock. Big Irish hands.

376
00:33:54,923 --> 00:33:56,402
Well, that's typical.

377
00:33:56,483 --> 00:33:59,236
First-class dogs come down here
to take a shit.

378
00:33:59,322 --> 00:34:01,996
Lets us know where we rank
in the scheme of things.

379
00:34:02,083 --> 00:34:03,800
Like we could forget.

380
00:34:05,082 --> 00:34:06,401
I'm Tommy Ryan.

381
00:34:06,482 --> 00:34:07,881
- Jack Dawson.
- Hello.

382
00:34:07,962 --> 00:34:09,441
- Fabrizio.
- Hi.

383
00:34:10,362 --> 00:34:12,876
Do you make any money
with your drawings?

384
00:34:21,842 --> 00:34:23,355
Forget it, boyo.

385
00:34:24,122 --> 00:34:26,113
You'd as like have angels
fly out of your arse ...

386
00:34:26,202 --> 00:34:28,431
as get next to the likes of her.

387
00:34:50,561 --> 00:34:53,951
I saw my whole life
as if I'd already lived it.

388
00:34:54,601 --> 00:34:57,752
An endless parade of parties
and cotillions ...

389
00:34:58,241 --> 00:35:00,152
yachts and polo matches.

390
00:35:00,761 --> 00:35:04,800
Always the same narrow people,
the same mindless chatter.

391
00:35:05,961 --> 00:35:08,952
I felt like I was standing at
a great precipice ...

392
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:12,030
with no one to pull me back.

393
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,998
No one who cared ...

394
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:15,953
or even noticed.

395
00:37:02,677 --> 00:37:03,996
Don't do it.

396
00:37:04,477 --> 00:37:05,751
Stay back.

397
00:37:06,717 --> 00:37:08,469
Don't come any closer.

398
00:37:09,317 --> 00:37:11,830
Come on. Just give me your hand,
I'll pull you back over.

399
00:37:11,917 --> 00:37:13,747
No! Stay where you are.

400
00:37:14,276 --> 00:37:15,596
I mean it.

401
00:37:16,156 --> 00:37:17,475
I'll let go.

402
00:37:28,276 --> 00:37:29,709
No, you won't.

403
00:37:30,996 --> 00:37:32,952
What do you mean, no I won't?

404
00:37:33,116 --> 00:37:36,950
Don't presume to tell me what I will
and will not do. You don't know me.

405
00:37:37,036 --> 00:37:39,504
Well, you would have done it already.

406
00:37:39,756 --> 00:37:41,950
You're distracting me. Go away.

407
00:37:42,116 --> 00:37:44,107
I can't. I'm involved now.

408
00:37:45,556 --> 00:37:48,308
You let go, and I'm gonna have
to jump in there after you.

409
00:37:50,355 --> 00:37:51,834
Don't be absurd.

410
00:37:52,275 --> 00:37:54,743
- You'll be killed.
- I'm a good swimmer.

411
00:37:54,835 --> 00:37:56,666
The fall alone will kill you.

412
00:37:56,755 --> 00:37:59,394
It would hurt.
I'm not saying it wouldn't.

413
00:37:59,995 --> 00:38:01,986
To tell you the truth,
I'm a lot more concerned ...

414
00:38:02,075 --> 00:38:04,145
about that water being so cold.

415
00:38:11,355 --> 00:38:12,549
How cold?

416
00:38:12,635 --> 00:38:15,513
Freezing.
Maybe a couple of degrees over.

417
00:38:20,394 --> 00:38:22,862
You ever ...
You ever been to Wisconsin?

418
00:38:26,474 --> 00:38:27,509
What?

419
00:38:27,674 --> 00:38:30,347
They have some of the coldest
winters around.

420
00:38:30,434 --> 00:38:32,789
I grew up there, near Chippewa Falls.

421
00:38:32,954 --> 00:38:35,991
I remember, when I was a kid,
me and my father ...

422
00:38:36,114 --> 00:38:38,582
we went ice fishing
out on Lake Wissota.

423
00:38:39,114 --> 00:38:42,789
- Ice fishing is, you know, where you —
- I know what ice fishing is.

424
00:38:43,514 --> 00:38:44,663
Sorry.

425
00:38:46,074 --> 00:38:49,271
You just seem like,
you know, kind of an indoor girl.

426
00:38:51,194 --> 00:38:52,421
Anyway, I ...

427
00:38:53,433 --> 00:38:55,503
I fell through some thin ice.

428
00:38:55,593 --> 00:38:57,185
And I'm telling you ...

429
00:38:58,393 --> 00:38:59,985
water that cold ...

430
00:39:00,313 --> 00:39:02,144
like right down there ...

431
00:39:02,713 --> 00:39:06,592
it hits you like a 1,000 knives
stabbing you all over your body.

432
00:39:07,193 --> 00:39:09,991
You can't breathe. You can't think.

433
00:39:11,433 --> 00:39:14,027
Least, not about anything but the pain.

434
00:39:16,713 --> 00:39:20,342
Which is why I'm not looking forward
to jumping in there after you.

435
00:39:21,073 --> 00:39:22,506
Like I said ...

436
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:25,189
I don't have a choice.

437
00:39:28,752 --> 00:39:31,824
I guess I'm kind of hoping you'll
come back over the rail an ...

438
00:39:31,912 --> 00:39:33,709
and get me off the hook here.

439
00:39:34,032 --> 00:39:35,465
You're crazy.

440
00:39:36,712 --> 00:39:38,703
That's what everybody says bu ...

441
00:39:40,152 --> 00:39:41,983
but with all due respect, miss ...

442
00:39:42,072 --> 00:39:44,950
I'm not the one hanging off
the back of a ship here.

443
00:39:45,472 --> 00:39:46,666
Come on.

444
00:39:47,392 --> 00:39:48,984
Give me your hand.

445
00:39:49,432 --> 00:39:51,423
You don't want to do this.

446
00:40:06,431 --> 00:40:07,989
I'm Jack Dawson.

447
00:40:09,431 --> 00:40:11,308
Rose Dewitt Bukater.

448
00:40:11,391 --> 00:40:14,224
I'll have to get you
to write that one down.

449
00:40:15,351 --> 00:40:16,545
Come on.

450
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:23,423
I got you. Come on.

451
00:40:24,231 --> 00:40:25,424
Come on!

452
00:40:29,830 --> 00:40:31,229
Help, please!

453
00:40:34,070 --> 00:40:37,107
- Please, help me!
- Listen to me. I've got you.

454
00:40:37,390 --> 00:40:38,869
I won't let go.

455
00:40:38,950 --> 00:40:41,066
Now pull yourself up. Come on!

456
00:40:43,790 --> 00:40:45,587
Come on. That's right.

457
00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:47,663
You can do it.

458
00:40:51,990 --> 00:40:53,309
I got you.

459
00:40:58,709 --> 00:41:00,267
What's all this?

460
00:41:05,669 --> 00:41:08,263
You stand back!
And don't move an inch!

461
00:41:10,589 --> 00:41:12,068
Fetch the master-at-arms.

462
00:41:14,069 --> 00:41:16,299
This is completely unacceptable.

463
00:41:16,589 --> 00:41:20,104
What made you think you could
put your hands on my fiancée?

464
00:41:20,469 --> 00:41:22,061
Look at me, you filth!

465
00:41:22,149 --> 00:41:24,185
- Cal.
- What do you think you were doing?

466
00:41:24,269 --> 00:41:26,384
Cal, stop. It was an accident.

467
00:41:27,508 --> 00:41:28,861
An accident?

468
00:41:29,508 --> 00:41:30,658
It was.

469
00:41:31,828 --> 00:41:33,227
Stupid, really.

470
00:41:33,308 --> 00:41:35,583
I was leaning over and I slipped.

471
00:41:38,108 --> 00:41:40,622
I was leaning far over to see the ...

472
00:41:45,268 --> 00:41:47,384
- Propellers?
- Propellers, and I slipped.

473
00:41:47,468 --> 00:41:51,143
And I would have gone overboard,
but Mr. Dawson here saved me.

474
00:41:51,388 --> 00:41:53,538
And almost went over himself.

475
00:41:54,028 --> 00:41:55,825
She wanted to see the propellers.

476
00:41:55,908 --> 00:41:58,706
Like I said,
women and machinery do not mix.

477
00:41:59,588 --> 00:42:01,419
Was that the way of it?

478
00:42:03,988 --> 00:42:06,103
Yeah, that was pretty much it.

479
00:42:06,187 --> 00:42:09,099
Well, the boy's a hero, then.
Good for you, son. Well done.

480
00:42:09,427 --> 00:42:12,225
So, it's all's well and
back to our brandy, eh?
- Aha.

481
00:42:13,507 --> 00:42:16,897
Look at you. You must be freezing.
Let's get you inside.

482
00:42:17,947 --> 00:42:20,541
Err ... perhaps a little
something for the boy?

483
00:42:22,347 --> 00:42:23,621
Of course.

484
00:42:24,067 --> 00:42:25,420
Mr. Lovejoy ...

485
00:42:25,507 --> 00:42:27,657
I think a 20 should do it.

486
00:42:27,987 --> 00:42:31,184
Is that the going rate
for saving the woman you love?

487
00:42:31,947 --> 00:42:33,619
Rose is displeased.

488
00:42:34,307 --> 00:42:35,625
What to do?

489
00:42:36,306 --> 00:42:37,421
I know.

490
00:42:39,506 --> 00:42:42,782
Perhaps you could join us
for dinner tomorrow evening.

491
00:42:43,466 --> 00:42:46,697
To regale our group
with your heroic tale.

492
00:42:49,426 --> 00:42:51,098
Sure. Count me in.

493
00:42:51,666 --> 00:42:53,497
Good. It's settled then.

494
00:42:54,866 --> 00:42:56,902
This should be interesting.

495
00:43:04,986 --> 00:43:07,135
Can I bum a smoke?

496
00:43:16,185 --> 00:43:18,141
You'll want to tie those.

497
00:43:19,905 --> 00:43:22,942
It's interesting.
The young lady slipped so suddenly ...

498
00:43:23,065 --> 00:43:26,535
and you still had time to remove
your jacket and your shoes.

499
00:43:41,784 --> 00:43:43,934
I know you've been melancholy.

500
00:43:45,024 --> 00:43:47,015
I don't pretend to know why.

501
00:43:49,424 --> 00:43:51,335
I intended to save this ...

502
00:43:51,504 --> 00:43:56,100
until the engagement gala next week.

503
00:43:57,584 --> 00:44:01,736
But I thought, tonight.

504
00:44:02,584 --> 00:44:03,983
Good gracious!

505
00:44:04,464 --> 00:44:07,536
Perhaps as a reminder
of my feelings for you.

506
00:44:07,944 --> 00:44:09,820
- Is it a —
- Diamond? Yes.

507
00:44:12,383 --> 00:44:14,772
56 carats to be exact.

508
00:44:17,263 --> 00:44:19,174
It was worn by Louis XVI.

509
00:44:20,103 --> 00:44:22,492
And they called it "Le Coeur de la Mer".

510
00:44:22,583 --> 00:44:25,893
- The "Heart of the Ocean".
- The "Heart of the Ocean". Yes.

511
00:44:30,863 --> 00:44:32,501
It's overwhelming.

512
00:44:32,783 --> 00:44:34,580
It's for royalty.

513
00:44:35,663 --> 00:44:37,414
We are royalty, Rose.

514
00:44:41,583 --> 00:44:44,460
You know, there is nothing
I couldn't give you.

515
00:44:44,622 --> 00:44:46,658
There is nothing I'd deny you ...

516
00:44:47,102 --> 00:44:48,933
if you would not deny me.

517
00:44:53,262 --> 00:44:55,332
Open your heart to me, Rose.

518
00:45:10,542 --> 00:45:12,772
I've been on my own since I was 15.

519
00:45:12,861 --> 00:45:14,534
Since my folks died.

520
00:45:15,301 --> 00:45:19,010
And I had no brothers or sisters
or close kin in that part of the country.

521
00:45:19,381 --> 00:45:22,214
So I lit on out of there
and I haven't been back since.

522
00:45:22,301 --> 00:45:25,532
You can just call me
a tumbleweed blowing in the wind.

523
00:45:27,461 --> 00:45:31,295
Well, Rose, we've walked
about a mile around this boat deck ...

524
00:45:32,021 --> 00:45:35,218
chewed over how great
the weather's been and how I grew up ...

525
00:45:35,501 --> 00:45:39,016
but I reckon that's not
why you came to talk to me, is it?

526
00:45:40,141 --> 00:45:41,813
- Mr. Dawson, I —
- Jack.

527
00:45:42,980 --> 00:45:44,129
Jack ...

528
00:45:44,581 --> 00:45:47,048
I want to thank you for what you did.

529
00:45:48,140 --> 00:45:50,859
Not just for pulling me back ...

530
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:54,133
- but for your discretion.
- You're welcome.

531
00:45:54,740 --> 00:45:55,889
Look ...

532
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:58,809
I know what you must be thinking:

533
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:02,610
"Poor little rich girl.
What does she know about misery?"

534
00:46:03,140 --> 00:46:04,289
No.

535
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:07,258
That's not what I was thinking.

536
00:46:07,660 --> 00:46:09,093
What I was thinking was ...

537
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:12,855
what could have happened to this girl
to make her think she had no way out?

538
00:46:14,459 --> 00:46:15,779
Well, I ...

539
00:46:16,780 --> 00:46:18,053
It was everything.

540
00:46:18,139 --> 00:46:21,290
It was my whole world
and all the people in it.

541
00:46:21,699 --> 00:46:23,610
And the inertia of my life ...

542
00:46:23,979 --> 00:46:26,777
plunging ahead,
and me, powerless to stop it.

543
00:46:27,459 --> 00:46:29,336
God, look at that thing.

544
00:46:29,619 --> 00:46:32,053
You'd have gone straight
to the bottom.

545
00:46:33,419 --> 00:46:36,013
500 invitations have gone out.

546
00:46:36,099 --> 00:46:38,772
All of Philadelphia society
will be there.

547
00:46:38,859 --> 00:46:41,168
And all the while, I feel I'm  ...

548
00:46:41,259 --> 00:46:43,454
standing in the middle of
a crowded room ...

549
00:46:43,539 --> 00:46:46,497
screaming at the top of my lungs,
and no one even looks up.

550
00:46:47,899 --> 00:46:49,412
Do you love him?

551
00:46:50,258 --> 00:46:51,452
Pardon me?

552
00:46:51,538 --> 00:46:53,051
Do you love him?

553
00:46:53,498 --> 00:46:56,649
You're being very rude.
You shouldn't be asking me this.

554
00:46:56,738 --> 00:46:59,855
It's a simple question.
Do you love the guy or not?

555
00:47:01,458 --> 00:47:03,414
This is not a suitable conversation.

556
00:47:03,498 --> 00:47:06,058
Why can't you
just answer the question?

557
00:47:07,298 --> 00:47:08,777
This is absurd.

558
00:47:08,938 --> 00:47:10,735
You don't know me
and I don't know you ...

559
00:47:10,818 --> 00:47:13,252
and we are not having
this conversation at all.

560
00:47:13,338 --> 00:47:16,136
You are rude and uncouth
and presumptuous and ...

561
00:47:16,218 --> 00:47:17,571
I am leaving now.

562
00:47:17,658 --> 00:47:20,217
Jack, Mr. Dawson,
it's been a pleasure.

563
00:47:20,298 --> 00:47:22,687
I sought you out to thank you
and now I have thanked you —

564
00:47:22,777 --> 00:47:24,574
And you've insulted me.

565
00:47:24,697 --> 00:47:26,255
Well, you deserved it.

566
00:47:26,337 --> 00:47:27,770
- Right.
- Right.

567
00:47:30,537 --> 00:47:32,892
- I thought you were leaving.
- I am.

568
00:47:35,537 --> 00:47:37,255
You are so annoying.

569
00:47:38,217 --> 00:47:40,367
Wait, I don't have to leave.

570
00:47:40,457 --> 00:47:43,051
This is my part of the ship.
You leave.

571
00:47:43,817 --> 00:47:46,411
Well, well, well!
Now who's being rude?

572
00:47:50,497 --> 00:47:53,533
What is this stupid thing
you're carrying around?

573
00:47:54,416 --> 00:47:57,055
So, what are you,
an artist or something?

574
00:48:00,736 --> 00:48:02,533
These are rather good.

575
00:48:05,456 --> 00:48:08,254
They're — they're very good, actually.

576
00:48:15,416 --> 00:48:17,327
Jack, this is exquisite work.

577
00:48:17,416 --> 00:48:20,135
They didn't think too much
of them in old Paree.

578
00:48:20,216 --> 00:48:21,284
Paris?

579
00:48:22,575 --> 00:48:24,726
You do get around for a ...

580
00:48:27,855 --> 00:48:29,891
Well, a person of limited means.

581
00:48:29,975 --> 00:48:32,250
Go on, a poor guy. You can say it.

582
00:48:35,615 --> 00:48:37,173
Well, well, well.

583
00:48:41,655 --> 00:48:43,850
And these were drawn from life?

584
00:48:46,535 --> 00:48:48,605
That's one of the good things
about Paris.

585
00:48:48,695 --> 00:48:51,652
Lots of girls willing to take
their clothes off.

586
00:48:56,615 --> 00:48:58,367
You liked this woman.

587
00:48:58,615 --> 00:49:00,605
You used her several times.

588
00:49:03,494 --> 00:49:05,803
Well, she had beautiful hands,
you see?

589
00:49:07,974 --> 00:49:10,044
I think you must have had
a love affair with her.

590
00:49:10,134 --> 00:49:12,364
No, no, no, no — just with her hands.

591
00:49:12,894 --> 00:49:15,169
She was a one-legged prostitute.

592
00:49:16,454 --> 00:49:17,443
See?

593
00:49:23,534 --> 00:49:26,093
She had a good sense of humor, though.

594
00:49:27,973 --> 00:49:29,646
And this lady ...

595
00:49:30,613 --> 00:49:33,047
she used to sit
at this bar every night ...

596
00:49:33,133 --> 00:49:35,647
wearing every piece of jewelry
she owned just ...

597
00:49:35,733 --> 00:49:38,167
waiting for her long lost love.

598
00:49:38,653 --> 00:49:40,689
We called her Madame Bijoux.

599
00:49:41,093 --> 00:49:43,527
See, her clothes are all moth-eaten.

600
00:49:44,693 --> 00:49:46,843
Well, you have a gift, Jack.

601
00:49:47,653 --> 00:49:48,768
You do.

602
00:49:49,413 --> 00:49:52,132
- You see people.
- I see you.

603
00:49:54,533 --> 00:49:55,567
And?

604
00:49:57,333 --> 00:49:59,289
You wouldn't have jumped.

605
00:50:03,013 --> 00:50:06,561
But the purpose of university
is to find a suitable husband.

606
00:50:06,812 --> 00:50:08,768
Rose has already done that.

607
00:50:08,852 --> 00:50:11,525
Look, here comes that vulgar
"Brown" woman.

608
00:50:11,732 --> 00:50:14,371
Quickly, get up
before she sits with us.

609
00:50:15,412 --> 00:50:17,926
Hello, girls.
I was hoping I'd catch you at tea.

610
00:50:18,012 --> 00:50:20,082
We're awfully sorry. You missed it.

611
00:50:20,172 --> 00:50:23,130
The Countess and I were just off
to take the air on the boat deck.

612
00:50:23,212 --> 00:50:26,363
What a lovely idea.
I need to catch up on my gossip.

613
00:50:29,452 --> 00:50:30,680
Countess.

614
00:50:32,131 --> 00:50:34,804
You've not yet lit
the last 4 boilers?

615
00:50:35,171 --> 00:50:37,048
No, I don't see the need.

616
00:50:37,131 --> 00:50:39,167
We are making excellent time.

617
00:50:39,811 --> 00:50:41,722
The press knows the size of Titanic.

618
00:50:41,811 --> 00:50:44,120
Now, I want them to marvel at her speed.

619
00:50:44,211 --> 00:50:46,850
We must give them
something new to print.

620
00:50:48,371 --> 00:50:51,488
This maiden voyage of Titanic
must make headlines.

621
00:50:52,611 --> 00:50:54,010
Mr. Ismay ...

622
00:50:54,811 --> 00:50:59,123
I would prefer not to push the engines
until they've been properly run in.

623
00:50:59,971 --> 00:51:01,404
Of course, I'm just a passenger.

624
00:51:01,491 --> 00:51:04,129
I leave it to your good offices
to decide what's best.

625
00:51:04,210 --> 00:51:06,804
But what a glorious end
to your final crossing ...

626
00:51:06,891 --> 00:51:10,166
if we were to get into New York
on Tuesday night and surprise them all.

627
00:51:10,250 --> 00:51:12,127
Make the morning papers.

628
00:51:12,210 --> 00:51:14,360
Retire with a bang, eh, E.J.?

629
00:51:17,930 --> 00:51:19,158
Good man.

630
00:51:20,130 --> 00:51:22,690
Well, after that, I worked
on a squid boat in Monterey,

631
00:51:23,370 --> 00:51:26,043
then I went down to Los Angeles
to the pier in Santa Monica ...

632
00:51:26,130 --> 00:51:29,406
and started doing portraits there
for 10 cents a piece.

633
00:51:29,650 --> 00:51:31,686
Why can't I be like you, Jack?

634
00:51:31,770 --> 00:51:35,045
Just head out for the horizon
whenever I feel like it.

635
00:51:36,930 --> 00:51:39,727
Say we'll go there sometime,
to that pier ...

636
00:51:39,810 --> 00:51:42,323
even if we only ever
just talk about it.

637
00:51:42,409 --> 00:51:45,082
No, we'll do it.
We'll drink cheap beer,

638
00:51:45,329 --> 00:51:48,207
we'll ride on the roller coaster
till we throw up.

639
00:51:48,289 --> 00:51:51,361
Then we'll ride horses on the beach,
right in the surf.

640
00:51:51,449 --> 00:51:55,442
But you'll have to do it like a real
cowboy, none of that side-saddle stuff.

641
00:51:55,769 --> 00:51:58,283
- You mean, one leg on each side?
- Yeah.

642
00:51:59,809 --> 00:52:02,243
- Can you show me?
- Sure, if you like.

643
00:52:04,169 --> 00:52:06,000
Teach me to ride like a man.

644
00:52:06,089 --> 00:52:07,965
And chew tobacco like a man.

645
00:52:08,648 --> 00:52:10,526
And spit like a man.

646
00:52:10,608 --> 00:52:12,997
What, they didn't teach you that
in finishing school?

647
00:52:13,088 --> 00:52:14,077
No.

648
00:52:14,808 --> 00:52:16,924
Come on, I'll show you. Let's do it.

649
00:52:17,008 --> 00:52:18,361
I'll show you how, come on.

650
00:52:18,448 --> 00:52:20,245
- Jack, no.
- Come on.

651
00:52:20,328 --> 00:52:22,205
- No. Wait, Jack.
- Come on.

652
00:52:22,528 --> 00:52:24,758
No, Jack. I couldn't possibly, Jack.

653
00:52:24,848 --> 00:52:26,281
Watch closely.

654
00:52:28,248 --> 00:52:29,840
That's disgusting.

655
00:52:30,088 --> 00:52:31,806
All right, your turn.

656
00:52:33,048 --> 00:52:35,482
That was pitiful.
Come on, you really gotta hawk it back.

657
00:52:35,568 --> 00:52:38,127
Get some leverage to it,
use your arms ...

658
00:52:38,208 --> 00:52:39,641
arc your neck.

659
00:52:40,407 --> 00:52:42,637
You see the range on that thing?

660
00:52:43,127 --> 00:52:44,560
Okay, go.

661
00:52:47,607 --> 00:52:49,802
- That was better. You got to work on it.
- Really?

662
00:52:49,887 --> 00:52:53,596
Really try to hawk it up
and get some body to it. You gotta ...

663
00:53:00,207 --> 00:53:01,356
Mother.

664
00:53:06,487 --> 00:53:08,557
May I introduce Jack Dawson?

665
00:53:09,967 --> 00:53:11,605
Charmed, I'm sure.

666
00:53:16,126 --> 00:53:18,481
The others were gracious
and curious ...

667
00:53:18,566 --> 00:53:20,875
about the man who'd saved my life.

668
00:53:21,966 --> 00:53:24,685
But my mother looked at him
like an insect.

669
00:53:25,086 --> 00:53:28,795
A dangerous insect
which must be squashed quickly.

670
00:53:29,446 --> 00:53:33,439
Jack, sounds like you're a good man
to have around in a sticky spot.

671
00:53:35,846 --> 00:53:38,155
Why do they always insist on
announcing dinner ...

672
00:53:38,246 --> 00:53:40,236
like a damn cavalry charge?

673
00:53:40,606 --> 00:53:42,596
Shall we go dress, Mother?

674
00:53:43,246 --> 00:53:45,122
See you at dinner, Jack.

675
00:53:47,045 --> 00:53:48,080
Son?

676
00:53:48,366 --> 00:53:49,400
Son!

677
00:53:50,125 --> 00:53:53,322
Do you have the slightest comprehension
of what you're doing?

678
00:53:53,405 --> 00:53:54,440
Not really.

679
00:53:54,525 --> 00:53:56,993
You're about to go into the snake pit.

680
00:53:59,085 --> 00:54:01,235
What are you planning to wear?

681
00:54:03,805 --> 00:54:05,477
I figured. Come on.

682
00:54:08,125 --> 00:54:09,604
I was right.

683
00:54:10,085 --> 00:54:12,473
You and my son
are just about the same size.

684
00:54:12,565 --> 00:54:13,963
Pretty close.

685
00:54:17,804 --> 00:54:19,920
You shine up like a new penny.

686
00:54:31,404 --> 00:54:32,996
Good evening, sir.

687
00:55:34,362 --> 00:55:37,479
There are several thousand tons
of Hockley steel in this very ship.

688
00:55:37,562 --> 00:55:39,757
- Which part?
- All the right ones, of course.

689
00:55:39,842 --> 00:55:42,231
Then we'll know who to hold accountable
if there's a problem.

690
00:55:42,322 --> 00:55:44,472
- Where's my daughter?
- She'll be along.

691
00:55:44,562 --> 00:55:46,314
There is the Countess.

692
00:55:46,442 --> 00:55:48,194
- Hello, my dear.
- Good evening, Cal.

693
00:55:48,282 --> 00:55:50,078
So good to see you.

694
00:56:14,441 --> 00:56:18,070
I saw that in a nickelodeon once
and I always wanted to do it.

695
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:31,192
I'll see you at dinner.

696
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:32,794
Darling ...

697
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:35,355
surely you remember Mr. Dawson.

698
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:36,914
Dawson.

699
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:39,399
That's amazing.

700
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:42,274
You could almost pass
for a gentleman.

701
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:43,794
Almost.

702
00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:45,598
Extraordinary.

703
00:56:56,799 --> 00:56:59,393
My dear, it's delightful to see you.

704
00:56:59,519 --> 00:57:00,793
What a remarkable voyage this is.

705
00:57:00,879 --> 00:57:03,347
- It's mad, isn't it?
- Completely lunatic.

706
00:57:04,319 --> 00:57:06,549
There's the Countess of Rothes.

707
00:57:09,319 --> 00:57:11,469
And that's John Jacob Astor ...

708
00:57:11,759 --> 00:57:13,477
the richest man on the ship.

709
00:57:13,559 --> 00:57:17,393
His little wifey there, Madeleine,
is my age, and in a delicate condition.

710
00:57:18,199 --> 00:57:19,951
See how she's trying to hide it?

711
00:57:20,039 --> 00:57:21,597
Quite the scandal.

712
00:57:22,079 --> 00:57:25,469
And that's Benjamin Guggenheim
and his mistress, Madame Aubert.

713
00:57:25,558 --> 00:57:28,675
Mrs. Guggenheim is at home
with the children, of course.

714
00:57:28,759 --> 00:57:32,148
And over here, we have Sir Cosmo
and Lucile, Lady Duff-Gordon.

715
00:57:32,238 --> 00:57:35,469
She designs naughty lingerie,
among her many talents.

716
00:57:35,798 --> 00:57:37,914
Very popular with the royals.

717
00:57:38,758 --> 00:57:41,192
Congratulations, Hockley.
She's splendid.

718
00:57:41,278 --> 00:57:42,711
Why, thank you.

719
00:57:43,198 --> 00:57:46,076
- Care to escort a lady to dinner?
- Certainly.

720
00:57:47,598 --> 00:57:49,077
Sweet pea?

721
00:57:50,238 --> 00:57:53,275
Ain't nothing to it, is there, Jack?
Remember, they love money.

722
00:57:53,358 --> 00:57:56,475
So just pretend like you own a
gold mine and you're in the club.

723
00:57:58,878 --> 00:58:00,105
Hey, Astor.

724
00:58:01,197 --> 00:58:03,427
Hello, Molly, nice to see you.

725
00:58:03,957 --> 00:58:06,471
J.J., Madeleine,
I'd like you to meet Jack Dawson.

726
00:58:06,557 --> 00:58:07,990
- How do you do?
- Pleasure.

727
00:58:08,077 --> 00:58:09,510
Well, Jack ...

728
00:58:09,917 --> 00:58:12,033
are you of the Boston Dawsons?

729
00:58:12,477 --> 00:58:15,071
No, the Chippewa Falls
Dawsons, actually.

730
00:58:15,157 --> 00:58:16,306
Oh, yes.

731
00:58:18,317 --> 00:58:21,434
He must have been nervous,
but he never faltered.

732
00:58:22,917 --> 00:58:25,067
They assumed he was one of them.

733
00:58:25,157 --> 00:58:27,751
Heir to a railroad fortune, perhaps.

734
00:58:28,757 --> 00:58:31,987
New money, obviously,
but still a member of the club.

735
00:58:33,396 --> 00:58:36,433
Mother, of course,
could always be counted upon.

736
00:58:37,276 --> 00:58:40,234
Tell us of the accommodations
in steerage, Mr. Dawson.

737
00:58:40,316 --> 00:58:42,034
I hear they're quite good
on this ship.

738
00:58:43,436 --> 00:58:46,189
The best I've seen, ma'am.
Hardly any rats.

739
00:58:49,396 --> 00:58:52,115
Mr. Dawson is joining us
from the third class.

740
00:58:52,196 --> 00:58:54,585
He was of some assistance
to my fiancée last night.

741
00:58:54,676 --> 00:58:57,429
It turns out that Mr. Dawson
is quite a fine artist.

742
00:58:57,516 --> 00:59:00,508
He was kind enough to show me
some of his work today.

743
00:59:00,596 --> 00:59:03,588
Rose and I differ somewhat
in our definition of fine art.

744
00:59:03,676 --> 00:59:05,745
Not to impugn your work, sir.

745
00:59:15,635 --> 00:59:16,829
Are these all for me?

746
00:59:16,915 --> 00:59:18,906
Just start from the outside
and work your way in.

747
00:59:18,995 --> 00:59:21,270
He knows every rivet in her,
don't you, Thomas?

748
00:59:21,355 --> 00:59:23,823
Your ship is a wonder,
Mr. Andrews. Truly.

749
00:59:23,915 --> 00:59:25,428
Thank you, Rose.

750
00:59:28,275 --> 00:59:29,754
How do you take your caviar, sir?

751
00:59:29,835 --> 00:59:31,631
No caviar for me, thanks.

752
00:59:31,715 --> 00:59:33,546
Never did like it much.

753
00:59:34,795 --> 00:59:37,467
And where exactly do you live,
Mr. Dawson?

754
00:59:37,634 --> 00:59:40,432
Right now, my address
is the RMS Titanic.

755
00:59:41,074 --> 00:59:43,224
After that, I'm on God's good humor.

756
00:59:43,314 --> 00:59:45,874
And how is it you have means to travel?

757
00:59:45,954 --> 00:59:48,070
I work my way from place to place.

758
00:59:48,154 --> 00:59:50,349
You know, tramp steamers and such.

759
00:59:50,434 --> 00:59:53,824
But I won my ticket on Titanic here
at a lucky hand at poker.

760
00:59:53,954 --> 00:59:55,546
A very lucky hand.

761
00:59:56,274 --> 00:59:58,310
All life is a game of luck.

762
00:59:59,474 --> 01:00:02,307
A real man makes his own luck,
Archie. Right, Dawson?

763
01:00:03,754 --> 01:00:07,462
And you find that sort of rootless
existence appealing, do you?

764
01:00:10,393 --> 01:00:11,985
Yes, ma'am, I do.

765
01:00:12,593 --> 01:00:15,710
I mean, I've got everything I need
right here with me.

766
01:00:15,793 --> 01:00:19,103
I got air in my lungs
and a few blank sheets of paper.

767
01:00:19,713 --> 01:00:22,910
I love waking up in the morning
not knowing what's gonna happen ...

768
01:00:23,233 --> 01:00:25,030
or who I'm gonna meet ...

769
01:00:25,113 --> 01:00:26,831
where I'm gonna wind up.

770
01:00:26,913 --> 01:00:29,552
Just the other night I was sleeping
under a bridge, and now ...

771
01:00:29,633 --> 01:00:31,783
here I am on the grandest
ship in the world ...

772
01:00:31,873 --> 01:00:33,511
having champagne with you fine people.

773
01:00:33,593 --> 01:00:35,390
I'll take some more of that.

774
01:00:35,793 --> 01:00:39,307
I figure life is a gift
and I don't intend on wasting it.

775
01:00:39,753 --> 01:00:42,347
You never know what hand
you're gonna get dealt next.

776
01:00:42,432 --> 01:00:44,582
You learn to take life
as it comes at you.

777
01:00:44,672 --> 01:00:46,185
Here you go, Cal.

778
01:00:47,592 --> 01:00:49,389
To make each day count.

779
01:00:50,072 --> 01:00:52,188
- Well said, Jack.
- Hear, hear.

780
01:00:53,232 --> 01:00:54,950
To making it count.

781
01:00:56,112 --> 01:00:57,784
To making it count!

782
01:00:58,392 --> 01:00:59,541
Bravo.

783
01:01:05,672 --> 01:01:09,221
But Mr. Brown had no idea
I'd hidden the money in the stove.

784
01:01:10,471 --> 01:01:14,385
So he comes home drunk as a pig,
celebrating, and he lights a fire.

785
01:01:16,951 --> 01:01:17,986
Bravo.

786
01:01:18,071 --> 01:01:20,710
Next it'll be brandies
in the smoking room.

787
01:01:22,151 --> 01:01:25,143
- Join me in a brandy, gentlemen?
- What a good idea.

788
01:01:25,671 --> 01:01:28,822
Now they retreat into a cloud of smoke
and congratulate each other ...

789
01:01:28,911 --> 01:01:30,503
on being masters of the universe.

790
01:01:30,591 --> 01:01:33,469
Ladies, thank you for the pleasure
of your company.

791
01:01:33,551 --> 01:01:35,109
Rose, may I escort you to the cabin?

792
01:01:35,191 --> 01:01:36,863
No, I'll stay here.

793
01:01:37,071 --> 01:01:38,743
Here you go, Molly.

794
01:01:39,230 --> 01:01:40,949
Joining us, Dawson?

795
01:01:41,030 --> 01:01:44,227
You don't want to stay out here
with the women, do you?

796
01:01:44,310 --> 01:01:47,586
- No, thanks, I've got to be heading back.
- Probably best.

797
01:01:47,670 --> 01:01:50,059
It'll be all business and politics,
that sort of thing.

798
01:01:50,150 --> 01:01:51,947
Wouldn't interest you.

799
01:01:52,110 --> 01:01:53,509
But, Dawson ...

800
01:01:53,910 --> 01:01:55,628
good of you to come.

801
01:02:00,070 --> 01:02:01,503
Jack, must you go?

802
01:02:01,590 --> 01:02:04,388
Time for me to go row
with the other slaves.

803
01:02:07,030 --> 01:02:08,622
Good night, Rose.

804
01:02:46,988 --> 01:02:49,183
So you want to go to a real party?

805
01:02:59,388 --> 01:03:01,822
Is okay if I put my hand here? Okay.

806
01:03:16,348 --> 01:03:17,417
What?

807
01:03:20,027 --> 01:03:21,824
I can't understand you.

808
01:03:52,946 --> 01:03:55,380
I'm going to dance
with her now, all right?

809
01:03:55,466 --> 01:03:56,615
Come on.

810
01:03:56,706 --> 01:03:58,139
- What?
- Come on.

811
01:03:58,226 --> 01:04:00,535
- Come with me.
- Jack! Jack, wait.

812
01:04:03,146 --> 01:04:04,340
I can't do this.

813
01:04:04,426 --> 01:04:07,736
We're gonna have to get
a little bit closer, like this.

814
01:04:10,506 --> 01:04:12,781
You're still my best girl, Cora.

815
01:04:15,426 --> 01:04:18,577
- I don't know the steps.
- Neither do I, just go with it.

816
01:04:18,666 --> 01:04:20,019
Don't think.

817
01:04:38,305 --> 01:04:40,944
Wait, Jack! Stop!

818
01:04:50,304 --> 01:04:51,704
Stop! Wait!

819
01:05:31,423 --> 01:05:33,095
Jack, no.

820
01:05:38,823 --> 01:05:40,814
... beyond the jurisdiction
of the Sherman Act.

821
01:05:40,903 --> 01:05:42,541
So my lawyers will argue.

822
01:05:42,623 --> 01:05:45,979
That's what Rockefeller said, but
the Supreme Court is not swallowing it.

823
01:06:05,382 --> 01:06:06,451
What?

824
01:06:06,542 --> 01:06:09,215
You think a first-class girl
can't drink?

825
01:06:11,262 --> 01:06:12,775
Get out of here.

826
01:06:12,862 --> 01:06:14,420
You all right?

827
01:06:15,982 --> 01:06:17,097
I'm fine.

828
01:06:17,182 --> 01:06:18,740
2 out of 3.

829
01:06:20,142 --> 01:06:21,177
So ...

830
01:06:22,422 --> 01:06:24,652
you think you're big tough men?

831
01:06:25,542 --> 01:06:27,338
Let's see you do this.

832
01:06:29,101 --> 01:06:31,490
Hold this for me, Jack. Hold it up.

833
01:06:48,621 --> 01:06:50,339
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

834
01:06:50,421 --> 01:06:53,458
- Are you all right?
- I haven't done that in years.

835
01:07:28,220 --> 01:07:29,573
Coffee, sir?

836
01:07:39,099 --> 01:07:41,613
I had hoped you would come to me
last night.

837
01:07:42,779 --> 01:07:44,098
I was tired.

838
01:07:46,859 --> 01:07:50,169
Your exertions below decks were,
no doubt, exhausting.

839
01:07:52,099 --> 01:07:55,933
I see you had that undertaker
of a manservant follow me. How typical.

840
01:07:56,019 --> 01:07:59,773
You will never behave like that again,
Rose, do you understand?

841
01:08:02,018 --> 01:08:05,567
I'm not a foreman in one of
your mills that you can command.

842
01:08:06,538 --> 01:08:08,096
I'm your fiancée.

843
01:08:10,698 --> 01:08:12,256
My fiancée!

844
01:08:12,578 --> 01:08:14,489
Yes, you are, and my wife!

845
01:08:15,138 --> 01:08:19,177
My wife in practice, if not yet
by law. So you will honor me.

846
01:08:19,658 --> 01:08:22,650
You'll honor me the way a wife
is required to honor her husband.

847
01:08:22,738 --> 01:08:25,457
Because I will not be made
out a fool, Rose.

848
01:08:25,538 --> 01:08:27,529
Is this in any way unclear?

849
01:08:28,298 --> 01:08:29,287
No.

850
01:08:29,618 --> 01:08:31,973
Good. Excuse me.

851
01:08:37,377 --> 01:08:38,652
Miss Rose.

852
01:08:40,417 --> 01:08:42,977
- We had a little accident.
- That's all right, Miss Rose.

853
01:08:43,057 --> 01:08:44,649
- Sorry, Trudy.
- It's all right.

854
01:08:44,737 --> 01:08:46,011
Let me help you.

855
01:08:46,097 --> 01:08:47,815
It's all right, miss.

856
01:08:53,617 --> 01:08:55,016
It's all right, miss.

857
01:09:00,697 --> 01:09:03,086
- Tea, Trudy.
- Yes, ma'am.

858
01:09:18,616 --> 01:09:21,767
You are not to see that boy again.
Do you understand me?

859
01:09:22,936 --> 01:09:25,211
Rose, I forbid it.

860
01:09:26,176 --> 01:09:29,293
Stop it, Mother.
You'll give yourself a nosebleed.

861
01:09:29,376 --> 01:09:31,048
This is not a game.

862
01:09:31,496 --> 01:09:33,566
Our situation is precarious.

863
01:09:33,656 --> 01:09:35,135
You know the money's gone.

864
01:09:35,216 --> 01:09:37,252
Of course I know it's gone.

865
01:09:37,735 --> 01:09:39,613
You remind me every day.

866
01:09:40,335 --> 01:09:44,886
Your father left us nothing but a legacy
of bad debts hidden by a good name.

867
01:09:45,375 --> 01:09:48,094
That name is the only card
we have to play.

868
01:09:48,575 --> 01:09:50,406
I don't understand you.

869
01:09:50,695 --> 01:09:54,370
It is a fine match with Hockley.
It will ensure our survival.

870
01:09:55,935 --> 01:09:57,812
How can you put this on my shoulders?

871
01:09:57,895 --> 01:09:59,613
Why are you being so selfish?

872
01:09:59,695 --> 01:10:01,287
I'm being selfish?

873
01:10:04,695 --> 01:10:07,573
Do you want to see me working
as a seamstress?

874
01:10:09,255 --> 01:10:11,051
Is that what you want?

875
01:10:13,454 --> 01:10:16,048
To see our fine things
sold at auction?

876
01:10:17,894 --> 01:10:20,283
Our memories scattered to the winds?

877
01:10:30,334 --> 01:10:31,892
It's so unfair.

878
01:10:33,494 --> 01:10:35,371
Of course it's unfair.

879
01:10:36,334 --> 01:10:37,653
We're women.

880
01:10:40,094 --> 01:10:42,130
Our choices are never easy.

- Hello, Mr. Andrews.
- Hello, Jack.

889
01:11:49,171 --> 01:11:51,002
I just need to talk to somebody
for a second.

890
01:11:51,092 --> 01:11:54,447
- Sir, you're not supposed to be in here.
- I just need to speak to someone.

891
01:11:57,411 --> 01:11:59,322
I was just here last night,
you don't remember me?

892
01:11:59,411 --> 01:12:00,446
No, I'm afraid I don't.

893
01:12:00,531 --> 01:12:02,999
- Now, you're gonna have to turn around.
- He'll tell you.

894
01:12:03,091 --> 01:12:04,444
I just need to talk —

895
01:12:04,531 --> 01:12:07,250
Mr. Hockley and Mrs. Dewitt Bukater ...

896
01:12:07,931 --> 01:12:10,525
continue to be appreciative
of your assistance.

897
01:12:10,851 --> 01:12:14,287
They asked me to give you this
in gratitude.

898
01:12:14,371 --> 01:12:16,043
I don't want your money. Please.
I just —

899
01:12:16,131 --> 01:12:19,247
Also to remind you
that you hold a third-class ticket ...

900
01:12:19,331 --> 01:12:22,083
and that your presence here
is no longer appropriate.

901
01:12:22,170 --> 01:12:24,206
Please, I just wanna speak
to Rose for one second.

902
01:12:24,291 --> 01:12:27,999
Gentlemen, please see Mr. Dawson
gets back to where he belongs ...

903
01:12:28,090 --> 01:12:29,967
and that he stays there.

904
01:12:30,330 --> 01:12:32,321
Yes, sir. Come along, you.

905
01:12:34,690 --> 01:12:37,329
♪ Hear us when we cry to Thee ♪

906
01:12:37,610 --> 01:12:42,400

907
01:12:43,330 --> 01:12:45,286
And why do you have
2 steering wheels?

908
01:12:45,370 --> 01:12:47,804
- We really only use this near shore.
- Excuse me, sir.

909
01:12:47,890 --> 01:12:50,450
Another ice warning.
This one is from the Noordam.

910
01:12:50,530 --> 01:12:52,167
Thank you, Sparks.

911
01:12:54,009 --> 01:12:57,479
Not to worry.
Quite normal for this time of year.

912
01:12:58,049 --> 01:13:01,803
In fact, we're speeding up.
I've just ordered the last boilers lit.

913
01:13:05,769 --> 01:13:08,806
Okay, son, wind it up tight
like I showed you. That's right.

914
01:13:08,889 --> 01:13:10,607
Okay, now, let it go.

915
01:13:16,489 --> 01:13:18,081
That's excellent.

916
01:13:22,088 --> 01:13:24,557
Mr. Andrews, forgive me ...

917
01:13:25,449 --> 01:13:27,325
I did the sum in my head ...

918
01:13:27,408 --> 01:13:31,196
and with the number of lifeboats
times the capacity you mentioned ...

919
01:13:31,288 --> 01:13:35,042
Forgive me, but it seems that there are
not enough for everyone aboard.

920
01:13:35,128 --> 01:13:36,846
About half, actually.

921
01:13:37,568 --> 01:13:39,763
Rose, you miss nothing, do you?

922
01:13:39,848 --> 01:13:42,237
In fact, I put in
these new-type davits ...

923
01:13:42,328 --> 01:13:45,445
which can take an extra row of boats
inside this one.

924
01:13:45,528 --> 01:13:47,678
But it was thought, by some ...

925
01:13:47,768 --> 01:13:49,599
the deck would look too cluttered.

926
01:13:49,688 --> 01:13:51,360
So, I was overruled.

927
01:13:52,008 --> 01:13:55,159
It's a waste of deck space as it is
in an unsinkable ship.

928
01:13:55,248 --> 01:13:57,044
Sleep soundly, young Rose.

929
01:13:57,128 --> 01:13:59,925
I have built you a good ship,
strong and true.

930
01:14:00,008 --> 01:14:01,804
She's all the lifeboat you need.

931
01:14:01,887 --> 01:14:04,959
Keep heading aft.
The next stop will be the engine room.

932
01:14:05,047 --> 01:14:06,196
Come on.

933
01:14:11,167 --> 01:14:14,125
Jack, this is impossible.
I can't see you.

934
01:14:14,207 --> 01:14:16,482
- I need to talk to you.
- No, Jack. No.

935
01:14:18,447 --> 01:14:20,358
Jack, I'm engaged.

936
01:14:21,647 --> 01:14:23,205
I'm marrying Cal.

937
01:14:24,127 --> 01:14:25,446
I love Cal.

938
01:14:29,126 --> 01:14:31,481
Rose, you're no picnic, all right?

939
01:14:31,566 --> 01:14:33,955
You're a spoiled little brat, even.

940
01:14:34,046 --> 01:14:36,879
But under that,
you're the most amazingly ...

941
01:14:37,446 --> 01:14:39,755
astounding, wonderful girl ...

942
01:14:40,366 --> 01:14:43,005
Woman that I've ever known and —

943
01:14:43,086 --> 01:14:45,281
- Jack, I —
- No, let me try to get this out.

944
01:14:45,366 --> 01:14:46,685
You're making ...

945
01:14:48,926 --> 01:14:51,804
I'm not an idiot.
I know how the world works.

946
01:14:51,886 --> 01:14:53,683
I've got $10 in my pocket.

947
01:14:53,766 --> 01:14:56,599
I have nothing to offer you
and I know that.

948
01:14:56,886 --> 01:14:58,285
I understand.

949
01:14:59,366 --> 01:15:01,242
But I'm too involved now.

950
01:15:01,325 --> 01:15:03,236
You jump, I jump, remember?

951
01:15:03,325 --> 01:15:06,601
I can't turn away without knowing
you'll be all right.

952
01:15:07,165 --> 01:15:08,996
That's all that I want.

953
01:15:09,965 --> 01:15:11,478
Well, I'm fine.

954
01:15:12,445 --> 01:15:14,356
I'll be fine. Really.

955
01:15:15,685 --> 01:15:16,834
Really?

956
01:15:18,685 --> 01:15:20,277
I don't think so.

957
01:15:21,485 --> 01:15:22,998
They have got you trapped, Rose.

958
01:15:23,085 --> 01:15:25,076
And you're gonna die
if you don't break free.

959
01:15:25,165 --> 01:15:27,962
Maybe not right away,
because you're strong ...

960
01:15:28,924 --> 01:15:32,473
but sooner or later, that fire
that I love about you, Rose ...

961
01:15:32,565 --> 01:15:34,680
that fire's going to burn out.

962
01:15:39,644 --> 01:15:42,033
It's not up to you to save me, Jack.

963
01:15:43,364 --> 01:15:44,797
You're right.

964
01:15:45,884 --> 01:15:47,636
Only you can do that.

965
01:15:53,564 --> 01:15:56,078
I'm going back. Leave me alone.

966
01:16:07,963 --> 01:16:11,080
Tell Lucile about the disaster
you had with the stationers.

967
01:16:11,163 --> 01:16:13,802
Of course, the invitations had to be
sent back, twice.

968
01:16:13,883 --> 01:16:16,761
- Oh, my dear.
- And the dreadful bridesmaids' gowns.

969
01:16:16,843 --> 01:16:19,277
Let me tell you,
what an odyssey that has been.

970
01:16:19,363 --> 01:16:23,072
Rose decided she wanted lavender.
She knows I detest the color.

971
01:16:23,163 --> 01:16:25,199
She did it to spite me.

972
01:16:25,283 --> 01:16:27,399
If only you'd come to me sooner.

973
01:16:27,483 --> 01:16:29,713
Ruth saw some of my designs
in La Mode lllustrée ...

974
01:16:29,803 --> 01:16:30,952
they were for the trousseau ...

975
01:16:31,043 --> 01:16:34,035
of the Duchess of Marlborough's youngest
daughter. They were quite charming.

976
01:16:34,123 --> 01:16:36,352
I think you'll agree, my dear,
that together ...

977
01:16:37,002 --> 01:16:39,721
we've created something
of a phoenix from the ashes.

978
01:16:53,962 --> 01:16:55,315
Hello, Jack.

979
01:17:00,602 --> 01:17:02,194
I changed my mind.

980
01:17:08,122 --> 01:17:10,238
They said you might be up here —

981
01:17:11,921 --> 01:17:13,559
Give me your hand.

982
01:17:20,481 --> 01:17:22,199
Now close your eyes.

983
01:17:23,201 --> 01:17:24,350
Go on.

984
01:17:27,481 --> 01:17:28,834
Now step up.

985
01:17:32,761 --> 01:17:35,480
Now hold on to the railing.
Keep your eyes closed.

986
01:17:35,561 --> 01:17:37,279
- Don't peek.
- I'm not.

987
01:17:38,521 --> 01:17:40,352
Step up onto the rail.

988
01:17:44,320 --> 01:17:46,390
Hold on. Hold on.

989
01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:48,391
Keep your eyes closed.

990
01:17:48,720 --> 01:17:51,553
- Do you trust me?
- I trust you.

991
01:18:01,360 --> 01:18:04,033
All right, open your eyes.

992
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:12,869
I'm flying. Jack.

993
01:18:37,039 --> 01:18:40,634
♪ Come, Josephine,
in my flying machine ♪

994
01:18:40,718 --> 01:18:45,473
♪ Going up she goes, up she goes ♪

995
01:19:31,357 --> 01:19:34,429
That was the last time Titanic
ever saw daylight.

996
01:19:35,277 --> 01:19:37,996
We're up to dusk,
the night of the sinking.

997
01:19:38,237 --> 01:19:40,353
- 6 hours to go.
- Incredible.

998
01:19:40,557 --> 01:19:42,229
There's Smith,
and he's standing there ...

999
01:19:42,317 --> 01:19:44,706
and he's got the iceberg warning
in his fucking hand.

1000
01:19:44,797 --> 01:19:47,549
Excuse me, his hand,
and he's ordering more speed.

1001
01:19:47,636 --> 01:19:50,355
26 years of experience working
against him.

1002
01:19:50,916 --> 01:19:55,034
He figures anything big enough to sink
the ship, they're gonna see in time to turn.

1003
01:19:55,116 --> 01:19:57,755
But the ship's too big
with too small a rudder.

1004
01:19:57,836 --> 01:19:59,906
Doesn't corner worth a damn.

1005
01:20:00,396 --> 01:20:02,466
Everything he knows is wrong.

1006
01:20:14,676 --> 01:20:18,146
It's quite proper, I assure you.
This is the sitting room.

1007
01:20:20,195 --> 01:20:22,345
- Will this light do?
- What?

1008
01:20:22,675 --> 01:20:24,825
Don't artists need good light?

1009
01:20:24,915 --> 01:20:28,590
That is true, but I'm not used to working
in such horrible conditions.

1010
01:20:29,715 --> 01:20:30,864
Monet!

1011
01:20:32,035 --> 01:20:34,151
- You know his work?
- Of course.

1012
01:20:34,595 --> 01:20:36,984
Look at his use of color here.
Isn't he great?

1013
01:20:37,075 --> 01:20:39,066
I know. It's extraordinary.

1014
01:20:41,195 --> 01:20:44,471
Cal insists on carting
this hideous thing everywhere.

1015
01:20:44,875 --> 01:20:47,514
Should we be expecting him
anytime soon?

1016
01:20:48,195 --> 01:20:51,072
Not as long as the cigars
and brandy hold out.

1017
01:20:54,594 --> 01:20:57,313
That's nice. What is it, a sapphire?

1018
01:20:58,234 --> 01:21:01,192
A diamond. A very rare diamond.

1019
01:21:04,954 --> 01:21:08,469
Jack, I want you to draw me
like one of your French girls.

1020
01:21:08,834 --> 01:21:11,394
- Wearing this.
- All right.

1021
01:21:13,194 --> 01:21:14,786
Wearing only this.

1022
01:21:48,673 --> 01:21:50,345
The last thing I need ...

1023
01:21:50,432 --> 01:21:53,743
is another picture of me
looking like a porcelain doll.

1024
01:21:56,513 --> 01:21:58,423
As a paying customer ...

1025
01:22:00,112 --> 01:22:02,182
I expect to get what I want.

1026
01:22:19,352 --> 01:22:21,866
Over on the bed. The couch.

1027
01:22:30,311 --> 01:22:32,029
Lie down.

1028
01:22:35,871 --> 01:22:39,500
- Tell me when it looks right.
- Put your arm back the way it was.

1029
01:22:41,151 --> 01:22:44,507
Put that other arm up,
that hand right by your face there.

1030
01:22:45,911 --> 01:22:47,060
Right.

1031
01:22:47,671 --> 01:22:49,423
Now, head down.

1032
01:22:51,711 --> 01:22:53,827
Eyes to me, keep them on me.

1033
01:22:55,830 --> 01:22:57,583
And try to stay still.

1034
01:23:15,790 --> 01:23:17,109
So serious.

1035
01:23:57,389 --> 01:24:00,222
I believe you are blushing,
Mr. Big Artiste.

1036
01:24:04,509 --> 01:24:07,181
I can't imagine
Monsieur Monet blushing.

1037
01:24:08,388 --> 01:24:10,060
He does landscapes.

1038
01:24:10,908 --> 01:24:13,183
- Just relax your face.
- Sorry.

1039
01:24:13,268 --> 01:24:14,587
No laughing.

1040
01:24:44,307 --> 01:24:46,821
My heart was pounding the whole time.

1041
01:24:47,507 --> 01:24:50,897
It was the most erotic
moment of my life ...

1042
01:24:54,587 --> 01:24:56,543
up until then, at least.

1043
01:24:57,667 --> 01:24:59,464
So what happened next?

1044
01:25:00,107 --> 01:25:02,575
You mean, did we do it?

1045
01:25:06,266 --> 01:25:07,938
Sorry to disappoint you, Mr. Bodine.

1046
01:25:08,027 --> 01:25:10,063
Jack was very professional.

1047
01:25:17,426 --> 01:25:18,745
Thank you.

1048
01:25:26,746 --> 01:25:28,418
What are you doing?

1049
01:25:28,826 --> 01:25:31,579
Will you put this back
in the safe for me?

1050
01:25:42,785 --> 01:25:44,821
- Gentlemen, would you excuse me?
- Sure.

1051
01:25:46,825 --> 01:25:49,214
None of the stewards have seen her.

1052
01:25:49,705 --> 01:25:52,060
This is absurd. It's a ship.

1053
01:25:52,145 --> 01:25:54,420
There's only so many places
she could be.

1054
01:25:54,505 --> 01:25:56,097
Lovejoy, find her.

1055
01:26:13,065 --> 01:26:14,497
- Clear.
- Yes.

1056
01:26:15,704 --> 01:26:18,616
I don't think I've ever seen
such a flat calm.

1057
01:26:19,824 --> 01:26:22,975
Like a mill pond.
Not a breath of wind.

1058
01:26:24,264 --> 01:26:26,903
It will make
the 'bergs harder to see ...

1059
01:26:27,184 --> 01:26:29,618
with no breaking water at the base.

1060
01:26:40,504 --> 01:26:41,937
Well, I'm off.

1061
01:26:42,024 --> 01:26:44,743
Maintain speed and heading,
Mr. Lightoller.

1062
01:26:45,063 --> 01:26:46,258
Yes, sir.

1063
01:26:57,063 --> 01:26:58,655
It's getting cold.

1064
01:26:58,863 --> 01:27:00,774
- You look nice.
- Miss Rose?

1065
01:27:01,823 --> 01:27:03,142
My drawings.

1066
01:27:28,182 --> 01:27:29,376
Come on, Jack!

1067
01:27:32,782 --> 01:27:34,659
- Wait!
- Wait!

1068
01:27:35,742 --> 01:27:37,858
- Go!
- Take us down, quick.

1069
01:27:37,942 --> 01:27:39,375
- Go!
- Quickly! Quickly!

1070
01:27:44,542 --> 01:27:45,576
Bye.

1071
01:27:53,061 --> 01:27:54,050
Sorry.

1072
01:27:59,381 --> 01:28:01,372
- Keep going.
- Thank you, I've got it.

1073
01:28:11,181 --> 01:28:13,695
Pretty tough for a valet, this fella.

1074
01:28:13,781 --> 01:28:16,341
- Seems more like a cop.
- I think he was.

1075
01:28:16,980 --> 01:28:18,459
- Oh, shit.
- Go!

1076
01:28:22,981 --> 01:28:25,414
- No, over here!
- Quick!

1077
01:28:32,220 --> 01:28:34,495
- Now what?
- What?

1078
01:28:40,620 --> 01:28:43,088
More coal for number one, mate.

1079
01:28:43,180 --> 01:28:45,330
What are you two doing down here?

1080
01:28:45,420 --> 01:28:47,695
You shouldn't be down here.
It could be dangerous!

1081
01:28:51,379 --> 01:28:53,574
Carry on. Don't mind us.

1082
01:28:53,660 --> 01:28:56,617
You're doing a great job.
Keep up the good work!

1083
01:29:11,819 --> 01:29:13,810
Look at what we have here.

1084
01:29:31,378 --> 01:29:32,606
Thank you.

1085
01:29:43,778 --> 01:29:45,257
Where to, miss?

1086
01:29:46,618 --> 01:29:48,051
To the stars.

1087
01:30:06,297 --> 01:30:07,650
You nervous?

1088
01:30:10,017 --> 01:30:11,052
No.

1089
01:30:27,297 --> 01:30:29,333
Put your hands on me, Jack.

1090
01:30:53,016 --> 01:30:54,529
It's bloody cold.

1091
01:30:54,616 --> 01:30:57,288
You know, I can smell ice, you know.
When it's near.

1092
01:30:59,255 --> 01:31:01,769
- Bollocks!
- Well, I can, all right?

1093
01:31:02,695 --> 01:31:04,925
Did you ever find those binoculars
for the lookouts?

1094
01:31:05,015 --> 01:31:07,449
Haven't seen them since Southampton.

1095
01:31:07,535 --> 01:31:09,924
Well, I'll be on my rounds. Cheerio.

1096
01:31:40,334 --> 01:31:41,926
You're trembling.

1097
01:31:43,774 --> 01:31:46,413
Don't worry, I'll be all right.

1098
01:32:07,533 --> 01:32:09,808
- They ran down there.
- All right.

1099
01:32:18,613 --> 01:32:20,171
Anything missing?

1100
01:32:44,012 --> 01:32:45,923
I've got a better idea.

1101
01:32:58,212 --> 01:32:59,201
Gotcha!

1102
01:33:08,132 --> 01:33:10,247
Did you see those guys' faces?

1103
01:33:11,411 --> 01:33:12,969
Did you see them?

1104
01:33:19,291 --> 01:33:21,122
When the ship docks ...

1105
01:33:22,411 --> 01:33:24,367
I'm getting off with you.

1106
01:33:25,171 --> 01:33:27,048
- This is crazy.
- I know.

1107
01:33:27,131 --> 01:33:29,042
It doesn't make any sense.

1108
01:33:30,531 --> 01:33:32,327
That's why I trust it.

1109
01:33:41,770 --> 01:33:43,442
Here, look at this.

1110
01:33:44,210 --> 01:33:46,041
Look at that, would you?

1111
01:33:46,130 --> 01:33:48,121
They're a bit warmer than we are.

1112
01:33:48,210 --> 01:33:50,644
If that's what it takes for us
to get warm, I'd rather not ...

1113
01:33:50,730 --> 01:33:52,527
if it's all the same to you, all right?

1114
01:34:04,210 --> 01:34:06,041
Bugger me!

1115
01:34:10,689 --> 01:34:12,486
Pick up, you bastards!

1116
01:34:15,649 --> 01:34:17,879
- Is anyone there?
- Yes, what do you see?

1117
01:34:17,969 --> 01:34:20,278
- Iceberg, right ahead!
- Thank you.

1118
01:34:22,809 --> 01:34:24,128
Iceberg, right ahead!

1119
01:34:24,209 --> 01:34:25,881
Hard to starboard!

1120
01:34:32,729 --> 01:34:35,118
Turn! Smartly!

1121
01:34:39,729 --> 01:34:41,082
Full astern!

1122
01:34:43,168 --> 01:34:45,523
- Hard over.
- Helm's hard over, sir.

1123
01:34:49,168 --> 01:34:50,601
Go, lads, go!

1124
01:34:53,248 --> 01:34:55,762
Bring that steam down!
Bring it down!

1125
01:34:57,648 --> 01:35:00,037
Shut all the dampers! Shut them!

1126
01:35:04,608 --> 01:35:05,836
Hold it.

1127
01:35:09,848 --> 01:35:12,122
Now! Engage the reversing engine.

1128
01:35:39,447 --> 01:35:41,243
Why ain't they turning?

1129
01:35:41,327 --> 01:35:44,204
- Is it hard over?
- It is. Yes, sir, hard over.

1130
01:35:49,246 --> 01:35:52,363
Come on. Come on. Turn.

1131
01:36:02,846 --> 01:36:03,835
Yes.

1132
01:36:09,206 --> 01:36:10,685
It's gonna hit!

1133
01:36:21,685 --> 01:36:23,084
Jesus Christ!

1134
01:36:43,005 --> 01:36:44,358
Jesus.

1135
01:36:44,445 --> 01:36:46,879
- Hard to port!
- Hard to port!

1136
01:36:56,524 --> 01:36:57,718
Get back!

1137
01:37:25,723 --> 01:37:27,156
Come on, let's go!

1138
01:37:27,243 --> 01:37:29,677
Get out of the door.
They're closing the doors!

1139
01:37:29,763 --> 01:37:30,957
Get out!

1140
01:37:36,843 --> 01:37:39,038
Get out of the door! Go!

1141
01:37:39,923 --> 01:37:42,642
Come on, lads! Go, lads, go!

1142
01:37:54,563 --> 01:37:55,597
Out!

1143
01:38:09,682 --> 01:38:10,956
Oh, my God.

1144
01:38:12,282 --> 01:38:13,874
That was a close shave, wasn't it?

1145
01:38:13,962 --> 01:38:16,396
Smell ice, can you? Bleeding Christ!

1146
01:38:20,722 --> 01:38:23,236
Note the time and enter it in the log.

1147
01:38:28,761 --> 01:38:30,797
What was that, Mr. Murdoch?

1148
01:38:31,281 --> 01:38:32,839
An iceberg, sir.

1149
01:38:33,681 --> 01:38:37,435
I put her hard to starboard, and ran the
engines full astern, but it was too close.

1150
01:38:37,521 --> 01:38:39,716
I tried to port round it, but she hit.

1151
01:38:39,801 --> 01:38:42,952
- Close the watertight doors.
- Doors are closed, sir.

1152
01:38:45,641 --> 01:38:47,359
- All stop.
- Aye, sir.

1153
01:38:55,481 --> 01:38:57,472
Find the carpenter.
Get him to sound the ship.

1154
01:38:57,560 --> 01:38:58,754
Yes, sir.

1155
01:39:09,160 --> 01:39:11,196
Come on, let's get the hell
out of here.

1156
01:39:11,280 --> 01:39:12,315
Come on, hurry up.

1157
01:39:17,160 --> 01:39:18,957
Excuse me,
why have the engines stopped?

1158
01:39:19,040 --> 01:39:21,031
- I felt a shudder.
- I shouldn't worry, madam.

1159
01:39:21,120 --> 01:39:24,032
We've likely thrown a propeller blade.
That's the shudder you felt.

1160
01:39:24,120 --> 01:39:25,917
May I bring you anything?

1161
01:39:25,999 --> 01:39:27,068
No, thank you.

1162
01:39:32,159 --> 01:39:34,434
So, now there's talk of an iceberg.
Did you see anything?

1163
01:39:34,519 --> 01:39:36,316
I don't see anything now. Do you?

1164
01:39:38,119 --> 01:39:41,270
If this is the direction the rats
are going, that's good enough for me.

1165
01:39:44,159 --> 01:39:46,150
Everything's under control.

1166
01:39:47,959 --> 01:39:49,995
- You there.
- Sir, there is no emergency.

1167
01:39:50,079 --> 01:39:51,717
Yes, there is. I've been robbed.

1168
01:39:51,799 --> 01:39:53,278
Get the master-at-arms.

1169
01:39:53,359 --> 01:39:55,236
- Now, you moron!
- Yes, sir.

1170
01:39:58,359 --> 01:40:00,235
Hey, did I miss the fun?

1171
01:40:01,718 --> 01:40:03,674
- Did you see what happened?
- No, I missed it.

1172
01:40:03,759 --> 01:40:05,875
Apparently, it hit over there.

1173
01:40:06,078 --> 01:40:08,638
Boiler Room 6 is flooded
8 feet above the plate ...

1174
01:40:08,718 --> 01:40:10,754
and the mail hold is worse.
She's all buckled in —

1175
01:40:10,838 --> 01:40:12,908
- Can you shore up?
- Not unless the pumps get ahead.

1176
01:40:12,998 --> 01:40:14,670
Have you seen the damage
in the mail hold?

1177
01:40:14,758 --> 01:40:16,874
No, she's already underwater.

1178
01:40:16,958 --> 01:40:18,311
This is bad.

1179
01:40:20,518 --> 01:40:22,190
We should tell Mother and Cal.

1180
01:40:23,278 --> 01:40:25,473
I think they're very good, sir.

1181
01:40:28,038 --> 01:40:31,508
Don't touch anything.
I want the entire room photographed.

1182
01:40:35,877 --> 01:40:38,152
We've been looking for you, miss.

1183
01:40:42,277 --> 01:40:43,346
Here we go.

1184
01:40:49,277 --> 01:40:51,472
Something serious has happened.

1185
01:40:52,037 --> 01:40:53,436
Yes, it has.

1186
01:40:54,757 --> 01:40:55,792
Indeed.

1187
01:40:55,877 --> 01:40:58,186
Two things dear to me
have disappeared this evening.

1188
01:40:58,277 --> 01:41:01,393
Now that one is back, I have a pretty
good idea where to find the other.

1189
01:41:01,477 --> 01:41:02,511
Search him.

1190
01:41:02,597 --> 01:41:04,188
- Take your coat off, son.
- Now what?

1191
01:41:04,277 --> 01:41:05,504
Come on, now.

1192
01:41:05,596 --> 01:41:07,394
Cal, what are you doing?

1193
01:41:07,476 --> 01:41:09,706
We're in the middle of an emergency.
What's going on?

1194
01:41:09,796 --> 01:41:11,866
- Is this it?
- That's it.

1195
01:41:12,476 --> 01:41:14,068
This is horseshit!

1196
01:41:14,916 --> 01:41:16,668
Don't you believe it, Rose. Don't.

1197
01:41:16,756 --> 01:41:18,667
- He couldn't have.
- Of course he could.

1198
01:41:18,756 --> 01:41:20,348
It's easy enough for a professional.

1199
01:41:20,436 --> 01:41:23,075
But I was with him the whole time.
This is absurd.

1200
01:41:23,156 --> 01:41:27,115
Perhaps he did it while you were putting
your clothes back on, dear.

1201
01:41:27,516 --> 01:41:29,666
Real slick, Cal.
Rose, they put it in my pocket.

1202
01:41:29,756 --> 01:41:32,668
- Shut up.
- It isn't even your pocket. Is it, son?

1203
01:41:32,755 --> 01:41:34,747
"Property of A.L. Ryerson."

1204
01:41:38,355 --> 01:41:39,755
That was reported stolen today.

1205
01:41:39,835 --> 01:41:41,666
I just borrowed it.
I was gonna return it.

1206
01:41:41,755 --> 01:41:44,144
An honest thief.
We have an honest thief here, do we?

1207
01:41:44,235 --> 01:41:47,033
You know I didn't do this, Rose.
You know it.

1208
01:41:47,195 --> 01:41:48,833
Don't believe them, Rose. You know it.

1209
01:41:48,915 --> 01:41:51,748
- You know I didn't do it.
- Come on, son. Let's go.

1210
01:41:51,835 --> 01:41:54,224
- Rose!
- Come on, there's a good lad.

1211
01:41:54,715 --> 01:41:55,830
Come on.

1212
01:41:55,915 --> 01:41:58,110
You know I didn't do it. You know me!

1213
01:41:59,355 --> 01:42:01,311
This is most unfortunate, Captain.

1214
01:42:05,194 --> 01:42:08,266
Water 14 feet above the keel
in 10 minutes ...

1215
01:42:08,954 --> 01:42:12,106
in the forepeak, in all 3 holds,
and in Boiler Room 6.

1216
01:42:12,194 --> 01:42:15,027
- That's right, sir.
- When can we get underway, damn it?

1217
01:42:15,114 --> 01:42:17,070
That's 5 compartments.

1218
01:42:18,714 --> 01:42:21,228
She can stay afloat with the
first 4 compartments breached ...

1219
01:42:21,314 --> 01:42:22,713
but not 5.

1220
01:42:23,154 --> 01:42:24,348
Not 5.

1221
01:42:24,554 --> 01:42:26,067
As she goes down by the head ...

1222
01:42:26,154 --> 01:42:29,305
the water will spill over the tops
of the bulkheads at "E" deck ...

1223
01:42:29,634 --> 01:42:31,943
from one to the next, back and back.

1224
01:42:32,114 --> 01:42:33,911
There's no stopping it.

1225
01:42:33,994 --> 01:42:35,313
The pumps. We open the pumps ...

1226
01:42:35,394 --> 01:42:38,067
The pumps buy you time,
but minutes only.

1227
01:42:39,113 --> 01:42:41,389
From this moment,
no matter what we do ...

1228
01:42:42,153 --> 01:42:43,871
Titanic will founder.

1229
01:42:46,473 --> 01:42:47,872
But this ship can't sink.

1230
01:42:47,953 --> 01:42:51,741
She's made of iron, sir.
I assure you, she can. And she will.

1231
01:42:52,833 --> 01:42:54,710
It is a mathematical certainty.

1232
01:42:59,193 --> 01:43:00,626
How much time?

1233
01:43:07,792 --> 01:43:09,988
An hour. Two, at most.

1234
01:43:16,032 --> 01:43:18,341
And how many aboard, Mr. Murdoch?

1235
01:43:18,512 --> 01:43:20,742
2,200 souls on board, sir.

1236
01:43:27,752 --> 01:43:30,710
Well, I believe you may
get your headlines, Mr. Ismay.

1237
01:43:47,910 --> 01:43:50,140
Oh, it is a little slut, isn't it?

1238
01:43:50,870 --> 01:43:52,861
You look at me
when I'm talking to you!

1239
01:43:53,030 --> 01:43:55,147
- Mr. Hockley?
- Not now. We're busy.

1240
01:43:55,231 --> 01:43:57,950
Sir, I've been told to ask you
to put on your lifebelts ...

1241
01:43:58,031 --> 01:44:00,022
and come up to the boat deck.
- I said, not now.

1242
01:44:00,111 --> 01:44:03,103
I'm sorry to inconvenience you,
Mr. Hockley, but it's Captain's orders.

1243
01:44:03,191 --> 01:44:05,069
Now please, dress warmly.

1244
01:44:05,352 --> 01:44:07,422
It's quite cold out tonight.

1245
01:44:07,792 --> 01:44:10,306
Now, may I suggest topcoats and hats?

1246
01:44:10,792 --> 01:44:12,464
This is ridiculous.

1247
01:44:13,152 --> 01:44:16,429
Not to worry, miss.
I'm sure it's just a precaution.

1248
01:44:16,873 --> 01:44:18,704
Everybody up. Lifebelts on.

1249
01:44:20,713 --> 01:44:22,431
What's he on about?

1250
01:44:22,513 --> 01:44:24,788
- Everybody up. Put your lifebelts on.
- What's the ruckus?

1251
01:44:24,873 --> 01:44:26,148
Just put your lifebelts on.

1252
01:44:27,594 --> 01:44:28,583
CQD?

1253
01:44:29,274 --> 01:44:30,343
Sir?

1254
01:44:31,874 --> 01:44:33,990
That's right, CQD, the distress call.

1255
01:44:34,474 --> 01:44:35,793
That's our position.

1256
01:44:40,995 --> 01:44:43,463
Tell whoever responds that we're
going down by the head ...

1257
01:44:43,555 --> 01:44:45,432
and need immediate assistance.

1258
01:44:53,956 --> 01:44:55,150
Blimey.

1259
01:45:05,157 --> 01:45:06,476
Keep lowering!

1260
01:45:12,478 --> 01:45:16,073
Steady! Make it taut! And winch out!

1261
01:45:21,039 --> 01:45:24,190
Uncover this boat!
Uncover all the boats aft!

1262
01:45:24,279 --> 01:45:25,951
Release those ties!

1263
01:45:26,159 --> 01:45:28,912
Roll back that cover! Smartly now!

1264
01:45:29,439 --> 01:45:31,078
Mr. Wilde, where are the passengers?

1265
01:45:31,160 --> 01:45:34,436
They've all gone back inside.
Too damn cold and noisy for them.

1266
01:45:34,520 --> 01:45:35,555
You there!

1267
01:45:36,520 --> 01:45:38,431
Get down here
and help with these lines!

1268
01:45:52,362 --> 01:45:54,193
Care for a drink, sir?

1269
01:45:55,282 --> 01:45:56,556
Please put your lifebelts on.

1270
01:45:56,642 --> 01:45:58,314
Sonny, what's doing?

1271
01:45:58,442 --> 01:46:01,240
You got us all trussed up here
and now we're cooling our heels.

1272
01:46:01,322 --> 01:46:03,234
Sorry, ma'am. Let me go find out.

1273
01:46:04,083 --> 01:46:06,836
I don't think anybody knows
what the hell's going on around here.

1274
01:46:06,923 --> 01:46:09,676
It's just the goddamned English,
doing everything by the book.

1275
01:46:09,763 --> 01:46:12,482
There's no need
for language, Mr. Hockley.

1276
01:46:12,723 --> 01:46:14,999
Go back and turn the heaters on
in our rooms.

1277
01:46:15,084 --> 01:46:16,881
I'd like a cup of tea when I return.

1278
01:46:16,964 --> 01:46:18,761
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

1279
01:46:27,965 --> 01:46:29,444
Mr. Andrews ...

1280
01:46:30,885 --> 01:46:33,797
I saw the iceberg.
And I see it in your eyes.

1281
01:46:34,165 --> 01:46:35,565
Please tell me the truth.

1282
01:46:43,806 --> 01:46:45,479
The ship will sink.

1283
01:46:47,127 --> 01:46:48,719
- You're certain?
- Yes.

1284
01:46:49,007 --> 01:46:50,679
In an hour or so ...

1285
01:46:51,447 --> 01:46:54,519
all this will be
at the bottom of the Atlantic.

1286
01:46:55,207 --> 01:46:56,243
What?

1287
01:46:56,328 --> 01:46:58,284
Please, tell only who you must.

1288
01:46:58,368 --> 01:47:00,518
I don't want to be
responsible for a panic.

1289
01:47:00,688 --> 01:47:03,248
And get to a boat.
Quickly. Don't wait.

1290
01:47:04,288 --> 01:47:07,122
You remember
what I told you about the boats?

1291
01:47:09,449 --> 01:47:10,484
Yes.

1292
01:47:12,369 --> 01:47:13,802
I understand.

1293
01:47:17,970 --> 01:47:20,279
Yes, madam,
please put it on immediately.

1294
01:47:21,490 --> 01:47:22,969
Over here, son.

1295
01:47:23,810 --> 01:47:26,199
Sir, they need you up
at the second-class purser's office.

1296
01:47:26,290 --> 01:47:29,169
- There's a big mob up there.
- Go on. I'll keep an eye on him.

1297
01:47:29,691 --> 01:47:31,044
Aye. Right.

1298
01:47:44,412 --> 01:47:45,481
Sir!

1299
01:47:45,572 --> 01:47:47,927
Carpathia says they're making 17 knots.

1300
01:47:48,012 --> 01:47:49,889
Full steam for them, sir.

1301
01:47:51,173 --> 01:47:52,731
She's the only one who's responding?

1302
01:47:52,813 --> 01:47:54,212
The only one close, sir.

1303
01:47:54,293 --> 01:47:56,409
Says they can be here in 4 hours.

1304
01:47:56,933 --> 01:47:58,252
4 hours!

1305
01:48:03,374 --> 01:48:04,932
Thank you, Bride.

1306
01:48:09,254 --> 01:48:10,403
My God.

1307
01:48:19,655 --> 01:48:21,885
We are swung out and ready, sir.

1308
01:48:23,016 --> 01:48:26,213
Hadn't we better get the women
and children into the boats, sir?

1309
01:48:28,696 --> 01:48:29,811
Yes.

1310
01:48:29,896 --> 01:48:30,931
Sir?

1311
01:48:33,497 --> 01:48:36,694
Women and children first, yes.

1312
01:48:38,057 --> 01:48:39,285
Yes, sir.

1313
01:48:42,097 --> 01:48:45,135
Ladies and gentlemen,
your attention, please!

1314
01:48:45,458 --> 01:48:47,688
Step this way, please. That's right.

1315
01:48:47,858 --> 01:48:50,167
Come towards me. Thank you.

1316
01:48:51,618 --> 01:48:52,687
Good.

1317
01:48:52,858 --> 01:48:56,738
For the time being, I shall
require only women and children.

1318
01:48:57,019 --> 01:48:59,055
- Gentlemen, please.
- Right here.

1319
01:48:59,139 --> 01:49:02,768
All right, boys. Like the Captain said,
nice and cheery, so there's no panic.

1320
01:49:03,819 --> 01:49:05,378
Wedding Dance.

1321
01:49:13,180 --> 01:49:15,455
Lifebelts on. Put your lifebelts on.

1322
01:49:16,981 --> 01:49:18,619
Here, put your lifebelt on.

1323
01:49:18,701 --> 01:49:20,737
Yeah, come on. Put your lifebelt on.

1324
01:49:20,821 --> 01:49:22,379
Turn that around.

1325
01:49:23,421 --> 01:49:24,615
Please.

1326
01:49:26,581 --> 01:49:28,971
It isn't time to go up to the boats yet!

1327
01:49:29,342 --> 01:49:30,821
Please stay calm.

1328
01:49:30,902 --> 01:49:34,577
Make sure, everybody,
you've got your lifebelts on.

1329
01:49:34,662 --> 01:49:37,335
And, gentlemen, allow the women
and children through to the front.

1330
01:49:37,422 --> 01:49:39,732
- What are we doing, Mommy?
- We're just waiting, dear.

1331
01:49:39,823 --> 01:49:42,212
When they finish putting
first-class people in the boats ...

1332
01:49:42,303 --> 01:49:45,340
they will be starting with us
and we'll want to be all ready, won't we?

1333
01:49:45,423 --> 01:49:46,856
Everybody, not just right yet.

1334
01:49:46,943 --> 01:49:48,775
Don't push on the gates.
You won't get out any faster.

1335
01:49:48,864 --> 01:49:50,217
- Someone help.
- Go and get some help.

1336
01:49:50,304 --> 01:49:52,772
Lower it away, left and right together!

1337
01:49:54,944 --> 01:49:57,219
Both sides together! Steady!

1338
01:49:58,024 --> 01:49:59,219
Steady!

1339
01:50:02,265 --> 01:50:03,744
Stop!

1340
01:50:04,745 --> 01:50:06,417
Hold the left side!

1341
01:50:06,505 --> 01:50:08,700
Right side only!

1342
01:50:09,025 --> 01:50:11,335
Right side only. Hold the left side!

1343
01:50:12,706 --> 01:50:14,424
Lower away together!

1344
01:50:16,146 --> 01:50:17,579
Steady, lads!

1345
01:51:03,310 --> 01:51:06,269
You know,
I do believe this ship may sink.

1346
01:51:08,751 --> 01:51:12,539
I've been asked to give you
this small token of our appreciation.

1347
01:51:15,432 --> 01:51:17,821
Compliments of Mr. Caledon Hockley.

1348
01:51:24,512 --> 01:51:27,266
Come on, sister. You heard the man.
Into the boat.

1349
01:51:27,633 --> 01:51:29,430
Any room for a gentleman, gentlemen?

1350
01:51:29,513 --> 01:51:31,583
Only women at this time, sir.

1351
01:51:33,953 --> 01:51:36,752
Will the lifeboats be seated
according to class?

1352
01:51:38,154 --> 01:51:40,384
I hope they're not too crowded.

1353
01:51:41,474 --> 01:51:43,704
Oh, Mother, shut up!

1354
01:51:44,194 --> 01:51:45,673
Don't you understand?

1355
01:51:45,754 --> 01:51:48,030
The water is freezing
and there aren't enough boats.

1356
01:51:48,115 --> 01:51:49,753
Not enough by half.

1357
01:51:50,115 --> 01:51:52,345
Half the people on this ship
are going to die.

1358
01:51:52,635 --> 01:51:54,353
Not the better half.

1359
01:51:56,035 --> 01:51:59,870
Come on, Ruth, get in the boat.
First-class seats are right up here.

1360
01:52:00,556 --> 01:52:02,592
You know, it's a pity
I didn't keep that drawing.

1361
01:52:02,676 --> 01:52:04,553
It'll be worth a lot more by morning.

1362
01:52:04,636 --> 01:52:07,594
Women and children
towards the front, please.

1363
01:52:07,676 --> 01:52:10,066
You unimaginable bastard.

1364
01:52:10,997 --> 01:52:13,636
Come on, Rose, darling.
There's plenty of room for you.

1365
01:52:13,717 --> 01:52:14,832
Right this way, miss.

1366
01:52:14,917 --> 01:52:16,316
Come on, Rose.

1367
01:52:16,397 --> 01:52:18,115
You're next, darling.

1368
01:52:18,277 --> 01:52:20,189
Come into the boat, Rose.

1369
01:52:21,318 --> 01:52:22,387
Come.

1370
01:52:22,838 --> 01:52:23,907
Rose?

1371
01:52:24,958 --> 01:52:26,596
Get into the boat.

1372
01:52:26,918 --> 01:52:27,987
Rose?

1373
01:52:29,438 --> 01:52:30,997
Goodbye, Mother.

1374
01:52:32,599 --> 01:52:33,668
Rose?

1375
01:52:34,119 --> 01:52:36,508
- Rose, come back here.
- Where are you going?

1376
01:52:36,999 --> 01:52:38,148
To him?

1377
01:52:38,279 --> 01:52:40,190
What, to be a whore to a gutter rat?

1378
01:52:40,279 --> 01:52:41,269
No, wait.

1379
01:52:41,360 --> 01:52:43,999
I'd rather be his whore
than your wife.

1380
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:47,989
No!

1381
01:52:48,560 --> 01:52:49,913
I said, no!

1382
01:52:51,601 --> 01:52:53,512
Rose, please stop!

1383
01:52:55,201 --> 01:52:56,759
- Lower away!
- No, stop!

1384
01:52:56,841 --> 01:52:58,479
- All together.
- No, wait!

1385
01:52:58,561 --> 01:52:59,880
Lower away!

1386
01:53:00,041 --> 01:53:01,156
Rose!

1387
01:53:07,322 --> 01:53:08,391
Help!

1388
01:53:09,122 --> 01:53:11,113
Can anybody hear me?

1389
01:53:12,242 --> 01:53:14,120
Hello! Help me!

1390
01:53:23,924 --> 01:53:25,243
Mr. Andrews!

1391
01:53:28,524 --> 01:53:31,084
- Steward, check the starboard corridor.
- Yes, Mr. Andrews.

1392
01:53:31,164 --> 01:53:33,962
Madam, please, put on a lifebelt.
Get to the boat deck immediately.

1393
01:53:34,044 --> 01:53:36,605
Lucy, for God's sake, put on
a lifebelt and set a good example.

1394
01:53:36,685 --> 01:53:37,913
Yes, sir.

1395
01:53:38,365 --> 01:53:40,560
- Anyone in here?
- Mr. Andrews?

1396
01:53:40,845 --> 01:53:41,880
Thank God.

1397
01:53:41,965 --> 01:53:44,525
Where would the master-at-arms
take someone under arrest?

1398
01:53:44,845 --> 01:53:47,280
- You have to get to a boat right away.
- No!

1399
01:53:47,366 --> 01:53:49,596
I'm doing this with or
without your help, sir.

1400
01:53:49,686 --> 01:53:51,642
But without will take longer.

1401
01:53:52,926 --> 01:53:55,724
Take the elevator to the very bottom.
Go to the left.

1402
01:53:55,807 --> 01:53:59,356
Down the crewmen's passage, then
go right and left again at the stairs.

1403
01:53:59,447 --> 01:54:00,880
You'll come to a long corridor.

1404
01:54:04,967 --> 01:54:06,606
This could be bad.

1405
01:54:10,728 --> 01:54:11,922
Oh, shit!

1406
01:54:18,529 --> 01:54:20,281
Excuse me. Thank you.

1407
01:54:21,649 --> 01:54:23,879
- I do not care what you think, sir.
- Lifts are closed.

1408
01:54:23,969 --> 01:54:26,722
I'm sorry, miss,
but the lifts are closed.

1409
01:54:27,689 --> 01:54:31,160
I'm through being polite,
God damn it! Now, take me down!

1410
01:54:32,850 --> 01:54:33,965
"E" deck.

1411
01:54:37,410 --> 01:54:38,604
Come on.

1412
01:54:57,412 --> 01:54:59,050
- I'm going back up.
- No.

1413
01:55:04,533 --> 01:55:07,843
Come back! I'm going back up!

1414
01:55:16,174 --> 01:55:17,607
Crew passage.

1415
01:55:39,736 --> 01:55:40,851
Jack!

1416
01:55:53,177 --> 01:55:54,213
Rose!

1417
01:55:55,218 --> 01:55:56,207
Jack!

1418
01:55:56,298 --> 01:55:57,890
Rose, I'm in here!

1419
01:55:59,218 --> 01:56:00,207
Jack!

1420
01:56:01,218 --> 01:56:02,253
- Jack!
- Rose!

1421
01:56:02,338 --> 01:56:04,899
Jack! Jack, I'm sorry.

1422
01:56:05,459 --> 01:56:07,529
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

1423
01:56:08,539 --> 01:56:12,054
- That guy, Lovejoy, put it in my pocket.
- I know. I know.

1424
01:56:12,139 --> 01:56:13,288
Listen, Rose ...

1425
01:56:13,379 --> 01:56:15,415
you're gonna have to find
a spare key, all right?

1426
01:56:15,499 --> 01:56:17,491
Look in that cabinet right there.

1427
01:56:17,820 --> 01:56:20,050
It's a little silver one, Rose.

1428
01:56:20,940 --> 01:56:21,929
Silver.

1429
01:56:22,540 --> 01:56:24,496
These are all brass ones!

1430
01:56:24,740 --> 01:56:26,572
Check right here, Rose.

1431
01:56:30,501 --> 01:56:31,695
Rose ...

1432
01:56:32,861 --> 01:56:34,931
how'd you find out I didn't do it?

1433
01:56:35,101 --> 01:56:37,821
I didn't.
I just realized I already knew.

1434
01:56:40,342 --> 01:56:41,775
Keep looking.

1435
01:56:50,263 --> 01:56:52,697
No key. There's no key!

1436
01:56:52,783 --> 01:56:53,818
All right, Rose, listen.

1437
01:56:53,903 --> 01:56:55,894
You're gonna have to go
find some help.

1438
01:56:56,383 --> 01:56:57,896
It'll be all right.

1439
01:57:02,064 --> 01:57:03,736
I'll be right back.

1440
01:57:10,905 --> 01:57:12,623
I'll just wait here!

1441
01:57:25,106 --> 01:57:27,176
Hello? Is there anyone here?

1442
01:57:27,586 --> 01:57:28,701
Hello?

1443
01:57:29,506 --> 01:57:31,577
Is there anybody down here?

1444
01:57:32,227 --> 01:57:33,945
We need help! Hello?

1445
01:57:35,707 --> 01:57:36,901
Damn it.

1446
01:57:42,628 --> 01:57:45,062
Can anybody hear me, please? Hello?

1447
01:57:48,308 --> 01:57:49,536
Oh, thank God.

1448
01:57:49,668 --> 01:57:52,786
Wait, I need your help.
There's a man back here.

1449
01:57:53,109 --> 01:57:54,098
Wait!

1450
01:57:58,109 --> 01:57:59,258
Hello?

1451
01:58:24,191 --> 01:58:25,341
Hello?

1452
01:58:26,152 --> 01:58:27,585
Miss, you shouldn't be here now.

1453
01:58:27,672 --> 01:58:30,106
- I need your help.
- We'll get you topside. This way, quickly.

1454
01:58:30,192 --> 01:58:31,591
There's a man down here. He's trapped.

1455
01:58:31,672 --> 01:58:33,947
- This way. There is no need to panic.
- Please!

1456
01:58:34,032 --> 01:58:36,706
No, I'm not panicking!
You're going the wrong way!

1457
01:58:36,993 --> 01:58:38,711
Let go of me! Listen!

1458
01:58:43,833 --> 01:58:45,425
The hell with you.

1459
01:59:21,357 --> 01:59:22,710
Oh, my God.

1460
02:00:09,161 --> 02:00:10,230
Jack!

1461
02:00:10,721 --> 02:00:11,790
Rose!

1462
02:00:12,882 --> 02:00:14,361
Will this work?

1463
02:00:15,282 --> 02:00:17,512
I guess we'll find out. Come on.

1464
02:00:20,882 --> 02:00:21,951
Wait.

1465
02:00:22,242 --> 02:00:24,199
Try a couple
of practice swings over there.

1466
02:00:29,923 --> 02:00:33,632
Good. Now try to hit the same
mark again, Rose. You can do it.

1467
02:00:39,244 --> 02:00:40,996
Okay. That's enough practice.

1468
02:00:41,324 --> 02:00:42,916
Come on, Rose. You can do it.

1469
02:00:43,724 --> 02:00:46,762
Listen, just hit it really hard
and really fast.

1470
02:00:48,685 --> 02:00:50,038
Come on. Wait.

1471
02:00:50,165 --> 02:00:51,757
Open your hands up a little more.

1472
02:00:51,845 --> 02:00:52,914
- Good.
- Like that?

1473
02:00:53,005 --> 02:00:54,154
Right.

1474
02:00:54,405 --> 02:00:56,362
Listen, Rose, I trust you.

1475
02:01:01,166 --> 02:01:02,155
Go.

1476
02:01:07,967 --> 02:01:09,116
You did it!

1477
02:01:09,487 --> 02:01:11,045
Come on, let's go.

1478
02:01:11,167 --> 02:01:12,998
Oh, shit, this is cold!

1479
02:01:20,888 --> 02:01:22,606
This is the way out.

1480
02:01:22,808 --> 02:01:25,276
We have to find another way.
Come on.

1481
02:01:38,850 --> 02:01:41,284
Now there's something
you don't see every day.

1482
02:02:02,571 --> 02:02:05,847
What's this luggage doing here?
Get rid of it. We need the room.

1483
02:02:05,931 --> 02:02:07,489
Get rid of that! Out!

1484
02:02:07,891 --> 02:02:10,929
Come. Time for her to go, sir.
Step back.

1485
02:02:11,012 --> 02:02:13,162
- Keep calm. Sit down.
- No.

1486
02:02:13,452 --> 02:02:15,807
- No!
- Make more room.

1487
02:02:16,852 --> 02:02:18,524
That's right. Look sharp.

1488
02:02:19,412 --> 02:02:20,561
Lovejoy.

1489
02:02:20,652 --> 02:02:22,769
She's not on the starboard side, either.

1490
02:02:23,053 --> 02:02:24,202
We're running out of time.

1491
02:02:24,293 --> 02:02:27,330
This strutting martinet
isn't letting any men on at all.

1492
02:02:27,573 --> 02:02:30,041
There's one on the other side
letting men on.

1493
02:02:30,133 --> 02:02:31,566
Then that's our play.

1494
02:02:31,813 --> 02:02:34,453
We'll need some insurance first.
Come on.

1495
02:02:34,534 --> 02:02:37,207
Come on, this way, please.
All the way down there.

1496
02:02:39,654 --> 02:02:40,723
Here!

1497
02:02:41,494 --> 02:02:43,690
What do you think you're doing?

1498
02:02:43,775 --> 02:02:45,845
You'll have to pay for that, you know.

1499
02:02:45,975 --> 02:02:48,694
- That's White Star Line property.
- Shut up!

1500
02:02:50,335 --> 02:02:53,806
Will you hold the boat a moment?
I just have to run back to my room ...

1501
02:02:53,896 --> 02:02:56,854
- Sit down.
- She's the last.

1502
02:02:56,936 --> 02:03:00,690
Mr. Lightoller, why are the boats
being launched half-full?

1503
02:03:00,776 --> 02:03:02,448
- Not now, Mr. Andrews.
- There, look.

1504
02:03:02,576 --> 02:03:05,091
20 or so in a boat built for 65?

1505
02:03:05,177 --> 02:03:07,532
And I saw one boat with only 12. 12!

1506
02:03:07,617 --> 02:03:10,336
We weren't sure of the weight,
Mr. Andrews.

1507
02:03:10,417 --> 02:03:12,647
- These boats may buckle.
- Rubbish!

1508
02:03:12,857 --> 02:03:15,418
They were tested in Belfast
with the weight of 70 men.

1509
02:03:15,498 --> 02:03:18,456
Now fill these boats, Mr. Lightoller.
For God's sake, man!

1510
02:03:25,298 --> 02:03:28,097
Please, I need more
women and children!

1511
02:03:32,739 --> 02:03:35,094
Get back in there!
This is not an exit.

1512
02:03:35,179 --> 02:03:36,738
Get back in there.

1513
02:03:39,260 --> 02:03:42,935
You can't keep us locked in here
like animals. The ship's bloody sinking.

1514
02:03:43,020 --> 02:03:45,056
Bring forward the women.

1515
02:03:45,140 --> 02:03:47,096
Unlock the gates.

1516
02:03:47,460 --> 02:03:49,099
Women only!

1517
02:04:02,022 --> 02:04:03,535
Lock the gates!

1518
02:04:11,623 --> 02:04:14,660
For God's sake, man, there are
women and children down here!

1519
02:04:14,783 --> 02:04:17,377
Let us up, so we can have a chance!

1520
02:04:17,663 --> 02:04:18,891
Get back!

1521
02:04:22,224 --> 02:04:23,498
- Jack.
- Tommy.

1522
02:04:23,584 --> 02:04:25,381
- Can we get out?
- It's hopeless that way.

1523
02:04:25,464 --> 02:04:27,500
Whatever we do,
we've got to do it fast.

1524
02:04:27,624 --> 02:04:28,818
Jack!

1525
02:04:28,904 --> 02:04:30,132
Fabrizio.

1526
02:04:30,585 --> 02:04:31,859
The boats are all gone.

1527
02:04:31,945 --> 02:04:33,901
This whole place is flooding.
We've got to get out.

1528
02:04:33,985 --> 02:04:35,862
- There is niente this way.
- All right.

1529
02:04:35,985 --> 02:04:37,657
Let's go this way,
all right? Come on.

1530
02:04:43,226 --> 02:04:45,501
- I make my own luck.
- So do I.

1531
02:04:53,347 --> 02:04:54,541
Come on!

1532
02:04:55,187 --> 02:04:56,700
No, come on, let's go this way.

1533
02:05:05,628 --> 02:05:06,902
This way.

1534
02:05:06,988 --> 02:05:11,106
Just go back to the main stairwell
and everything will be sorted out there.

1535
02:05:11,188 --> 02:05:12,177
The hell it will.

1536
02:05:12,508 --> 02:05:15,785
It will all get sorted out back there.
Go back to the main stairwell.

1537
02:05:15,909 --> 02:05:17,900
- Open the gate.
- Go back down the main stairwell.

1538
02:05:17,989 --> 02:05:18,978
Open the gate right now.

1539
02:05:19,069 --> 02:05:21,424
Go back down the main stairwell
like I told you!

1540
02:05:23,549 --> 02:05:26,144
God damn it! Son of a bitch!

1541
02:05:26,310 --> 02:05:27,584
Stop that!

1542
02:05:27,750 --> 02:05:29,502
Open the damn gate!

1543
02:05:32,070 --> 02:05:33,264
Fabri, Tommy, give me hand here.

1544
02:05:33,350 --> 02:05:35,501
- Move aside. Move aside!
- Pull!

1545
02:05:36,591 --> 02:05:37,660
Pull!

1546
02:05:38,391 --> 02:05:40,541
- Move aside.
- Put that down!

1547
02:05:40,631 --> 02:05:42,269
- Move aside!
- Put that down!

1548
02:05:42,351 --> 02:05:44,387
- One! Two!
- Stop that!

1549
02:05:44,591 --> 02:05:45,580
Three!

1550
02:05:47,712 --> 02:05:48,701
Again!

1551
02:05:50,832 --> 02:05:52,060
Let's go!

1552
02:05:53,992 --> 02:05:55,027
Let's go, Rose.

1553
02:05:55,112 --> 02:05:57,308
You can't go up there!
You can't do this!

1554
02:06:03,713 --> 02:06:05,385
Keep order here!

1555
02:06:05,473 --> 02:06:07,590
Get back. Get back!

1556
02:06:12,474 --> 02:06:13,953
Hold on to her!

1557
02:06:14,914 --> 02:06:16,063
Pull her in.

1558
02:06:16,714 --> 02:06:18,785
Get back, I say ...

1559
02:06:18,995 --> 02:06:21,463
or I'll shoot you all like dogs!

1560
02:06:21,555 --> 02:06:22,783
Keep order here!

1561
02:06:24,355 --> 02:06:25,868
Keep order, I say.

1562
02:06:27,435 --> 02:06:29,313
Mr. Lowe, man this boat.

1563
02:06:33,556 --> 02:06:34,625
Right.

1564
02:06:34,716 --> 02:06:37,469
Is everybody all right? Nobody panic.

1565
02:06:43,557 --> 02:06:44,785
Stay back!

1566
02:06:45,477 --> 02:06:46,626
We're too late.

1567
02:06:46,717 --> 02:06:48,594
There are more boats down the front.

1568
02:06:48,677 --> 02:06:51,715
Stay with this one. Murdoch.
He seems to be quite practical.

1569
02:06:53,638 --> 02:06:55,117
Stop lowering!

1570
02:06:56,238 --> 02:06:57,466
Stop lowering!

1571
02:06:57,798 --> 02:06:59,117
Cut the falls!

1572
02:07:05,799 --> 02:07:07,118
Sit down!

1573
02:07:08,159 --> 02:07:10,548
Stay back, you lot! Just stay back!

1574
02:07:10,759 --> 02:07:13,194
Stay back, the lot of you!
Just stay back!

1575
02:07:15,720 --> 02:07:18,280
It's starting to fall apart.
We don't have much time.

1576
02:07:19,720 --> 02:07:20,914
Mr. Murdoch?

1577
02:07:21,040 --> 02:07:23,714
Mr. Hockley. You two, with me, now!

1578
02:07:24,041 --> 02:07:27,238
I'm a businessman, as you know,
I have a business proposition for you.

1579
02:07:34,642 --> 02:07:35,791
Come on, Rose.

1580
02:07:39,082 --> 02:07:40,834
The boats are gone!

1581
02:07:45,483 --> 02:07:47,075
Colonel, are there any boats
on that side?

1582
02:07:47,163 --> 02:07:49,552
No, miss, but there are a couple
of boats all the way forward.

1583
02:07:49,643 --> 02:07:51,201
This way, I'll lead you.

1584
02:07:57,204 --> 02:07:59,877
What's the use?
Nobody's listening to us anyway.

1585
02:08:00,404 --> 02:08:04,192
They don't listen to us at dinner, either.
Come on, let's play. Keep us warm.

1586
02:08:05,564 --> 02:08:06,680
Orpheus.

1587
02:08:11,445 --> 02:08:14,278
Music to drown by.
Now I know I'm in first class.

1588
02:08:19,326 --> 02:08:22,284
- Where is everyone?
- They're all still aft, sir.

1589
02:08:22,486 --> 02:08:23,965
Come on, madam, don't cry.

1590
02:08:24,686 --> 02:08:26,881
We have an understanding,
then, Mr. Murdoch.

1591
02:08:37,567 --> 02:08:41,356
Will the men please hold back?
Hold back, I say!

1592
02:08:43,928 --> 02:08:47,477
Women and children only! Get back!

1593
02:08:47,928 --> 02:08:49,999
I said, step back, sir.
Come through, madam.

1594
02:08:50,089 --> 02:08:51,886
This way. Step back, sir!

1595
02:08:51,969 --> 02:08:52,958
Let the women —

1596
02:08:53,049 --> 02:08:55,085
You better check the other side. Go!

1597
02:09:02,610 --> 02:09:06,125
I found her, on the other side.
Waiting for a boat ...

1598
02:09:06,770 --> 02:09:07,919
with him.

1599
02:09:09,090 --> 02:09:11,730
- Any more women and children?
- They're all aboard, Mr. Murdoch.

1600
02:09:11,811 --> 02:09:13,324
Anyone else then?

1601
02:09:14,291 --> 02:09:15,644
- Hop on, sir.
- Anyone else?

1602
02:09:15,731 --> 02:09:17,562
Do hurry. Hurry along.

1603
02:09:20,771 --> 02:09:22,125
Stand by the falls.

1604
02:09:22,212 --> 02:09:24,009
God damn it all to hell.

1605
02:09:26,492 --> 02:09:27,527
Shit.

1606
02:09:27,612 --> 02:09:28,601
Fire!

1607
02:09:29,732 --> 02:09:31,928
Sir, you can't go through here.

1608
02:09:32,293 --> 02:09:34,090
Sir, you can't go through.

1609
02:09:35,853 --> 02:09:37,809
That's it. Splendid. Right.

1610
02:09:42,013 --> 02:09:43,367
Prepare to lower!

1611
02:09:45,614 --> 02:09:47,206
Ready on the left!

1612
02:09:53,054 --> 02:09:54,374
Take them down.

1613
02:09:59,215 --> 02:10:00,489
Keep it steady.

1614
02:10:02,935 --> 02:10:06,246
Both sides together.
Steady. Keep it steady.

1615
02:10:07,776 --> 02:10:09,846
- Give her to me.
- Daddy.

1616
02:10:10,136 --> 02:10:12,696
- It'll be fine, darling. Don't you worry.
- Take her.

1617
02:10:12,776 --> 02:10:14,494
Daddy, get in the boat.

1618
02:10:14,576 --> 02:10:17,887
It's goodbye for a little while.
Only for a little while.

1619
02:10:17,977 --> 02:10:19,615
There'll be another
boat for the daddies ...

1620
02:10:19,697 --> 02:10:21,369
this boat's for the mommies
and the children.

1621
02:10:21,457 --> 02:10:24,210
You hold Mommy's hand
and be a good little girl.

1622
02:10:24,897 --> 02:10:26,092
I'm not going without you.

1623
02:10:26,178 --> 02:10:28,487
- No. You have to go, now.
- No, Jack.

1624
02:10:28,818 --> 02:10:30,376
Get in the boat, Rose.

1625
02:10:30,458 --> 02:10:31,447
No, Jack.

1626
02:10:31,538 --> 02:10:33,256
Yes. Get on the boat.

1627
02:10:33,458 --> 02:10:35,335
Yes, get on the boat, Rose.

1628
02:10:38,419 --> 02:10:41,058
My God. Look at you.
You look a fright.

1629
02:10:41,579 --> 02:10:42,614
Here.

1630
02:10:44,219 --> 02:10:46,255
Put this on. Come on.

1631
02:10:51,580 --> 02:10:53,411
Go on. I'll get the next one.

1632
02:10:53,500 --> 02:10:55,377
No, not without you.

1633
02:10:55,460 --> 02:10:57,416
I'll be all right.
Listen, I'll be fine.

1634
02:10:57,500 --> 02:10:59,537
I'm a survivor, all right?
Don't worry about me.

1635
02:10:59,621 --> 02:11:00,815
Now, go on. Get on.

1636
02:11:00,901 --> 02:11:03,540
I have an arrangement with an officer
on the other side of the ship.

1637
02:11:03,621 --> 02:11:06,010
Jack and I can get off safely.
Both of us.

1638
02:11:07,461 --> 02:11:09,657
See? I got my own boat to catch.

1639
02:11:09,742 --> 02:11:12,302
- Go.
- Come on, hurry. They're almost full.

1640
02:11:13,582 --> 02:11:14,617
Step aboard, miss.

1641
02:11:14,702 --> 02:11:16,055
- Go.
- Come on, hurry.

1642
02:11:16,862 --> 02:11:18,898
- Step aboard, please.
- You're Daddy's good girl.

1643
02:11:18,982 --> 02:11:21,133
- Step lively!
- Keep back.

1644
02:11:21,263 --> 02:11:22,901
Keep back, I say.

1645
02:11:24,663 --> 02:11:26,381
Clear the rail, please.

1646
02:11:27,383 --> 02:11:28,657
Lower away!

1647
02:11:32,224 --> 02:11:33,452
Steady.

1648
02:11:36,264 --> 02:11:38,334
And lower away evenly, lads.

1649
02:11:39,064 --> 02:11:40,053
Easy.

1650
02:11:40,504 --> 02:11:41,733
Lower away.

1651
02:11:41,825 --> 02:11:43,543
You're a good liar.

1652
02:11:43,705 --> 02:11:44,933
Almost as good as you.

1653
02:11:45,025 --> 02:11:47,698
Easy, now. And lower away.

1654
02:11:49,985 --> 02:11:53,058
There's no ...
There's no arrangement, is there?

1655
02:11:54,706 --> 02:11:56,219
No, there is.

1656
02:11:56,426 --> 02:11:58,576
Not that you'll benefit much from it.

1657
02:11:58,666 --> 02:11:59,860
And even away.

1658
02:12:00,266 --> 02:12:01,255
I always win, Jack.

1659
02:12:01,346 --> 02:12:03,144
And lower away evenly, lads.

1660
02:12:03,227 --> 02:12:04,296
One way or another.

1661
02:12:04,387 --> 02:12:07,060
Watch that trim. Trim that boat.

1662
02:12:08,147 --> 02:12:09,136
Easy.

1663
02:12:10,107 --> 02:12:11,381
Even, lads.

1664
02:12:11,987 --> 02:12:14,616
Keep going!

1665
02:13:00,312 --> 02:13:01,381
Rose!

1666
02:13:03,552 --> 02:13:04,951
- Stop her!
- Rose!

1667
02:13:05,272 --> 02:13:07,184
- What are you doing?
- Stop her!

1668
02:13:08,153 --> 02:13:09,188
No!

1669
02:13:26,754 --> 02:13:27,869
Rose!

1670
02:13:31,155 --> 02:13:33,828
You're so stupid!
Why did you do that?

1671
02:13:34,235 --> 02:13:35,907
You're so stupid, Rose.

1672
02:13:37,635 --> 02:13:39,547
Why did you do that? Why?

1673
02:13:40,116 --> 02:13:41,993
You jump, I jump, right?

1674
02:13:44,076 --> 02:13:45,111
Right.

1675
02:13:47,156 --> 02:13:48,305
Oh, God.

1676
02:13:48,396 --> 02:13:50,786
I couldn't go. I couldn't go, Jack.

1677
02:13:51,357 --> 02:13:53,712
It's all right.
We'll think of something.

1678
02:13:54,597 --> 02:13:56,633
At least I'm with you.

1679
02:14:09,718 --> 02:14:11,037
Come on! Move!

1680
02:14:12,039 --> 02:14:13,267
Come on!

1681
02:14:14,119 --> 02:14:15,711
Come on! Move!

1682
02:14:21,799 --> 02:14:22,949
Come on!

1683
02:14:30,480 --> 02:14:31,515
Move!

1684
02:14:37,441 --> 02:14:38,840
Come on, come on, Rose!

1685
02:14:41,161 --> 02:14:42,560
Rose, come on!

1686
02:14:45,242 --> 02:14:46,311
Move, Rose!

1687
02:14:49,322 --> 02:14:50,357
Go!

1688
02:15:00,283 --> 02:15:02,433
I hope you enjoy your time together!

1689
02:15:16,405 --> 02:15:18,202
What could possibly be funny?

1690
02:15:19,085 --> 02:15:21,235
I put the diamond in the coat.

1691
02:15:24,125 --> 02:15:26,116
And I put the coat on her!

1692
02:15:27,646 --> 02:15:28,840
Come on.

1693
02:15:47,167 --> 02:15:48,840
Dada!

1694
02:15:51,888 --> 02:15:53,287
We can't leave him.

1695
02:15:57,288 --> 02:15:58,721
All right, come on!

1696
02:16:00,409 --> 02:16:02,240
Dada!

1697
02:16:14,610 --> 02:16:15,679
Go back!

1698
02:16:26,211 --> 02:16:28,406
That's the wrong way! Come back!

1699
02:16:34,892 --> 02:16:35,881
Go!

1700
02:16:38,212 --> 02:16:39,247
Go!

1701
02:16:40,132 --> 02:16:41,485
Run, Rose!

1702
02:16:48,613 --> 02:16:49,602
Jack!

1703
02:16:52,813 --> 02:16:54,247
- Jack!
- Rose!

1704
02:17:06,535 --> 02:17:07,604
This way!

1705
02:17:16,616 --> 02:17:17,605
Come on!

1706
02:17:18,936 --> 02:17:20,255
Give me your hand!

1707
02:17:28,697 --> 02:17:30,016
Oh, God!

1708
02:17:34,337 --> 02:17:35,372
Help!

1709
02:17:40,898 --> 02:17:42,013
Help!

1710
02:17:43,938 --> 02:17:46,247
Wait, sir! Sir,
open the gate, please!

1711
02:17:46,338 --> 02:17:48,728
- Please!
- Please, help us!

1712
02:17:48,979 --> 02:17:50,492
- Please!
- Please!

1713
02:17:51,699 --> 02:17:52,848
Bloody hell!

1714
02:17:56,099 --> 02:17:57,088
Hurry.

1715
02:17:58,500 --> 02:18:00,252
- Come on, come on!
- Come on!

1716
02:18:00,780 --> 02:18:01,929
Go, go!

1717
02:18:02,020 --> 02:18:03,089
Jesus.

1718
02:18:03,900 --> 02:18:05,219
- Please!
- Come on!

1719
02:18:05,540 --> 02:18:06,529
Hurry!

1720
02:18:06,900 --> 02:18:07,935
Come on!

1721
02:18:13,061 --> 02:18:14,733
I'm sorry, I dropped the keys.

1722
02:18:15,461 --> 02:18:16,735
- Wait, please!
- Wait!

1723
02:18:18,021 --> 02:18:20,855
Don't leave! Please, send for help!

1724
02:18:38,543 --> 02:18:40,614
I got it! Which one is it, Rose?

1725
02:18:40,904 --> 02:18:42,781
The short one. Try the short one.

1726
02:18:43,744 --> 02:18:45,018
Hurry, Jack.

1727
02:18:48,104 --> 02:18:50,095
Oh, no! No, it won't go in.

1728
02:18:50,344 --> 02:18:51,573
Hurry, Jack.

1729
02:18:54,105 --> 02:18:56,096
It's stuck! It's stuck!

1730
02:18:56,905 --> 02:18:58,816
- Come on!
- Hurry, Jack!

1731
02:19:00,105 --> 02:19:01,584
Hurry, Jack!

1732
02:19:04,266 --> 02:19:06,541
I got it! Go, Rose!

1733
02:19:07,426 --> 02:19:08,859
Go!

1734
02:19:18,547 --> 02:19:19,821
Jack!

1735
02:19:21,787 --> 02:19:23,186
Come on!

1736
02:19:24,508 --> 02:19:25,782
Move, move.

1737
02:19:35,469 --> 02:19:38,506
- Get those oars in place.
- Get an oar under it.

1738
02:19:39,229 --> 02:19:41,424
Women and children only, damn you!

1739
02:19:42,229 --> 02:19:44,789
Hold it!

1740
02:19:55,030 --> 02:19:58,944
Get these davits cranked in!
Let's get the falls hooked up!

1741
02:20:07,752 --> 02:20:08,980
Stay back!

1742
02:20:10,792 --> 02:20:12,111
Mommy!

1743
02:20:12,712 --> 02:20:14,304
Stay back, sir!

1744
02:20:15,712 --> 02:20:17,351
Stay back, I say.

1745
02:20:18,793 --> 02:20:20,226
Keep going up!

1746
02:20:22,993 --> 02:20:24,551
Stop pushing!

1747
02:20:25,513 --> 02:20:27,504
Stay back!

1748
02:20:27,593 --> 02:20:30,267
Will you give us a chance to live,
you limey bastard?

1749
02:20:30,354 --> 02:20:33,073
I'll shoot any man who tries
to get past me! Get back!

1750
02:20:33,154 --> 02:20:34,223
Bastard!

1751
02:20:34,314 --> 02:20:35,588
Get back!

1752
02:20:36,234 --> 02:20:38,145
We had a deal, damn it!

1753
02:20:40,475 --> 02:20:44,354
Your money can't save you anymore
than it can save me. Get back!

1754
02:20:45,555 --> 02:20:47,273
Women and children only!

1755
02:20:49,676 --> 02:20:50,950
Stop pushing!

1756
02:20:53,076 --> 02:20:54,350
No, Tommy!

1757
02:20:54,876 --> 02:20:56,628
No! No, Tommy!

1758
02:20:57,316 --> 02:20:58,544
Bastardo!

1759
02:21:15,478 --> 02:21:16,706
No, Will!

1760
02:21:23,199 --> 02:21:24,188
Now stand back, damn you!

1761
02:21:27,999 --> 02:21:30,308
Gently, hold it.

1762
02:21:40,360 --> 02:21:41,952
I have a child!

1763
02:21:43,040 --> 02:21:44,633
Clear a path!

1764
02:21:44,721 --> 02:21:46,632
Please, I have a child.

1765
02:21:47,361 --> 02:21:49,829
Please, I'm all she has in the world.

1766
02:21:50,641 --> 02:21:51,676
Go on.

1767
02:21:52,041 --> 02:21:53,474
Step back!

1768
02:21:53,561 --> 02:21:54,551
Please!

1769
02:21:54,642 --> 02:21:56,598
Here. Give her to me.

1770
02:22:02,362 --> 02:22:04,080
There, there.

1771
02:22:07,883 --> 02:22:10,272
Wait! Mr. Andrews.

1772
02:22:12,763 --> 02:22:13,991
Oh, Rose.

1773
02:22:16,524 --> 02:22:18,754
Won't you even make a try for it?

1774
02:22:19,964 --> 02:22:23,718
I'm sorry that I didn't build you
a stronger ship, young Rose.

1775
02:22:26,324 --> 02:22:28,316
It's going fast. We have to move.

1776
02:22:28,405 --> 02:22:29,440
Wait.

1777
02:22:32,445 --> 02:22:34,276
Good luck to you, Rose.

1778
02:22:35,725 --> 02:22:36,999
And to you.

1779
02:22:48,887 --> 02:22:51,606
Mr. Guggenheim? These are for you.

1780
02:22:51,687 --> 02:22:54,201
No, thank you.
We are dressed in our best ...

1781
02:22:54,287 --> 02:22:56,881
and are prepared to go down
as gentlemen.

1782
02:22:57,647 --> 02:22:59,286
But we would like a brandy.

1783
02:23:00,008 --> 02:23:01,885
Get the falls over here now!

1784
02:23:02,608 --> 02:23:05,042
Make them taut. Then we'll right it!

1785
02:23:11,409 --> 02:23:14,401
Capitain, Capitain,
where should I go? Please.

1786
02:23:20,210 --> 02:23:22,770
Captain. Sir.

1787
02:23:52,573 --> 02:23:54,450
Right. That's it, then.

1788
02:23:55,453 --> 02:23:57,489
Goodbye, Wally, good luck.

1789
02:23:57,813 --> 02:24:00,327
- Goodbye, Wallace.
- So long, old chap.

1790
02:25:11,260 --> 02:25:14,889
And so they lived happily
together for 300 years ...

1791
02:25:15,980 --> 02:25:18,414
in the land of "Tir na nÓg" ...

1792
02:25:18,701 --> 02:25:21,010
land of eternal youth and beauty.

1793
02:25:55,464 --> 02:25:58,217
There's no time! Cut the falls!

1794
02:25:58,304 --> 02:26:00,659
Cut them if you have to!

1795
02:26:01,264 --> 02:26:03,495
I need a knife!

1796
02:26:05,025 --> 02:26:08,415
Cut the falls now! Cut them loose!

1797
02:26:19,226 --> 02:26:21,023
Cut those bloody falls!

1798
02:27:06,551 --> 02:27:10,226
Gentlemen, it has been a privilege
playing with you tonight.

1799
02:28:08,756 --> 02:28:10,793
We have to stay on the ship
as long as possible.

1800
02:28:10,877 --> 02:28:12,071
Come on.

1801
02:28:23,518 --> 02:28:25,429
This way. Hold the rail.

1802
02:28:27,238 --> 02:28:29,433
Come on, Rose. Jump.

1803
02:28:31,878 --> 02:28:33,028
Come on.

1804
02:29:05,122 --> 02:29:06,760
I got you. Jump!

1805
02:29:09,202 --> 02:29:10,920
I've got you, miss.

1806
02:29:11,362 --> 02:29:12,761
- Jack!
- What?

1807
02:29:14,562 --> 02:29:15,598
Back!

1808
02:29:44,525 --> 02:29:46,197
No, you'll swamp us!

1809
02:29:54,206 --> 02:29:55,480
Nobody panic.

1810
02:29:58,687 --> 02:30:01,759
Yea, though I walk through the
valley of the shadow of death —

1811
02:30:01,847 --> 02:30:04,520
You want to walk a little faster
through that valley, there?

1812
02:30:52,492 --> 02:30:54,960
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us, sinners ...

1813
02:30:55,052 --> 02:30:57,361
now and at the hour
of our death. Amen.

1814
02:30:57,452 --> 02:30:58,885
Hail Mary, full of grace ...

1815
02:30:58,972 --> 02:31:00,166
This way.

1816
02:31:10,773 --> 02:31:12,172
Come on!

1817
02:31:21,134 --> 02:31:23,364
And I saw a new heaven
and a new Earth.

1818
02:31:23,454 --> 02:31:26,765
For the first heaven and the
first Earth had passed away ...

1819
02:31:28,055 --> 02:31:30,046
and there was no more sea.

1820
02:31:35,656 --> 02:31:38,693
It'll be over soon.
It'll all be over soon.

1821
02:31:44,376 --> 02:31:45,969
And he shall dwell with them ...

1822
02:31:46,057 --> 02:31:47,775
and they shall be his people ...

1823
02:31:47,857 --> 02:31:51,293
and God himself shall be with them
and be their God.

1824
02:31:52,417 --> 02:31:53,611
Jack ...

1825
02:31:54,417 --> 02:31:55,896
this is where we first met.

1826
02:32:02,978 --> 02:32:06,288
And God shall wipe away
all the tears from their eyes ...

1827
02:32:06,378 --> 02:32:08,654
and there shall be no more death ...

1828
02:32:09,219 --> 02:32:11,733
neither shall there
be sorrow or crying ...

1829
02:32:11,819 --> 02:32:14,287
neither shall there
be any more pain ...

1830
02:32:14,659 --> 02:32:17,127
for the former world has passed away.

1831
02:32:31,421 --> 02:32:33,616
Bloody pull faster! And pull!

1832
02:32:56,023 --> 02:32:57,456
Hang on, Miss Trudy!

1833
02:33:31,706 --> 02:33:33,344
Hold on real tight.

1834
02:33:50,228 --> 02:33:51,627
God almighty!

1835
02:33:58,829 --> 02:34:01,184
Keep those breakers in! Keep them in!

1836
02:35:17,196 --> 02:35:18,754
We have to move!

1837
02:35:23,957 --> 02:35:25,834
Give me your hand, I'll pull you over.

1838
02:35:26,157 --> 02:35:28,148
Come on, give me your hand.

1839
02:35:30,397 --> 02:35:32,514
I've got you. I won't let go.

1840
02:35:32,598 --> 02:35:33,587
Come on, I've got you.

1841
02:35:44,679 --> 02:35:47,193
- What's happening, Jack?
- I don't know.

1842
02:35:56,360 --> 02:35:57,918
- Hold on!
- Jack!

1843
02:36:00,920 --> 02:36:03,070
Somebody help me, please!

1844
02:36:38,124 --> 02:36:39,443
This is it!

1845
02:36:51,045 --> 02:36:53,275
Oh, my God, Jack!

1846
02:36:54,405 --> 02:36:55,599
Hold on!

1847
02:37:10,127 --> 02:37:12,357
The ship is gonna suck us down.

1848
02:37:12,647 --> 02:37:14,239
Take a deep breath when I say.

1849
02:37:19,688 --> 02:37:22,043
Kick for the surface and keep kicking.

1850
02:37:22,128 --> 02:37:23,607
Do not let go of my hand.

1851
02:37:30,609 --> 02:37:33,077
We're going to make it, Rose. Trust me.

1852
02:37:33,169 --> 02:37:34,488
I trust you.

1853
02:37:38,968 --> 02:37:42,200
Ready? Now!

1854
02:38:17,492 --> 02:38:19,244
Jack!

1855
02:38:23,012 --> 02:38:24,366
- Rose!
- Jack!

1856
02:38:28,813 --> 02:38:29,802
Jack!

1857
02:38:49,655 --> 02:38:51,247
Jack!

1858
02:39:01,856 --> 02:39:03,369
Get off her!

1859
02:39:06,936 --> 02:39:08,086
- Rose!
- Jack!

1860
02:39:08,177 --> 02:39:10,407
Swim, Rose! I need you to swim!

1861
02:39:14,137 --> 02:39:15,570
Keep swimming.

1862
02:39:19,298 --> 02:39:21,528
- It's so cold.
- Swim, Rose!

1863
02:39:26,778 --> 02:39:28,497
Come on. Here.

1864
02:39:29,859 --> 02:39:32,009
Keep swimming. Come on.

1865
02:39:34,299 --> 02:39:35,891
Here, get on it.

1866
02:39:37,179 --> 02:39:38,612
Get on top.

1867
02:39:45,780 --> 02:39:47,213
Come on, Rose.

1868
02:39:56,221 --> 02:39:58,132
Stay on it. Stay on, Rose.

1869
02:40:18,783 --> 02:40:20,614
It'll be all right now.

1870
02:40:22,664 --> 02:40:24,382
You'll be all right now.

1871
02:40:31,344 --> 02:40:34,223
Return the boats!

1872
02:40:38,065 --> 02:40:40,454
The boats are coming
back for us, Rose.

1873
02:40:40,745 --> 02:40:42,861
Hold on just a little bit longer.

1874
02:40:42,945 --> 02:40:45,506
They had to row away
for the suction ...

1875
02:40:46,746 --> 02:40:48,941
but now they'll be coming back.

1876
02:40:50,546 --> 02:40:51,865
For God's sake!

1877
02:40:51,946 --> 02:40:54,939
Please help us!

1878
02:41:00,067 --> 02:41:01,785
You don't understand.

1879
02:41:02,467 --> 02:41:06,586
If we go back, they'll swamp the boat.
They'll pull us right down, I'm telling you.

1880
02:41:06,668 --> 02:41:09,023
Knock it off. You're scaring me.

1881
02:41:09,348 --> 02:41:11,942
Come on, girls, grab an oar. Let's go.

1882
02:41:12,028 --> 02:41:15,304
Are you out of your mind? We're in
the middle of the North Atlantic.

1883
02:41:15,388 --> 02:41:18,665
Now, do you people want to live
or do you want to die?

1884
02:41:25,109 --> 02:41:27,340
I don't understand a one of you.

1885
02:41:29,030 --> 02:41:32,227
What's the matter with you?
It's your men out there!

1886
02:41:34,910 --> 02:41:36,548
There's plenty of room for more.

1887
02:41:36,630 --> 02:41:38,462
And there'll be one less on this boat.

1888
02:41:38,551 --> 02:41:41,270
If you don't shut
that hole in your face!

1889
02:41:56,752 --> 02:41:58,708
Bring in your oars over there.

1890
02:41:58,792 --> 02:42:01,307
Tie these two boats together as well.

1891
02:42:04,993 --> 02:42:07,712
Now, make sure that's tied up
nice and tight.

1892
02:42:10,914 --> 02:42:13,303
Right, listen to me, men.
We have to go back.

1893
02:42:13,394 --> 02:42:16,909
I want to transfer all the women
from this boat into that boat right now.

1894
02:42:16,994 --> 02:42:18,313
As quick as you can, please.

1895
02:42:18,394 --> 02:42:20,863
Let's create some space over there.
Move forward and out.

1896
02:42:30,235 --> 02:42:31,908
It's getting quiet.

1897
02:42:34,196 --> 02:42:38,906
It's just going to take a couple of
minutes to get the boats organized.

1898
02:42:42,397 --> 02:42:44,228
I don't know about you ...

1899
02:42:44,317 --> 02:42:48,071
but I intend to write
a strongly-worded letter ...

1900
02:42:48,157 --> 02:42:50,625
to the White Star Line about all this.

1901
02:42:57,518 --> 02:42:59,110
I love you, Jack.

1902
02:43:05,519 --> 02:43:07,111
Don't you do that.

1903
02:43:08,399 --> 02:43:10,515
Don't you say your goodbyes.

1904
02:43:10,959 --> 02:43:13,075
Not yet. Do you understand me?

1905
02:43:13,679 --> 02:43:15,033
I'm so cold.

1906
02:43:15,920 --> 02:43:17,353
Listen, Rose ...

1907
02:43:18,440 --> 02:43:20,317
you're gonna get out of here.

1908
02:43:21,080 --> 02:43:22,798
You're gonna go on ...

1909
02:43:23,280 --> 02:43:25,875
and you're gonna make lots of babies.

1910
02:43:26,321 --> 02:43:28,437
And you're gonna watch them grow.

1911
02:43:29,681 --> 02:43:33,640
You're gonna die an old lady,
warm in her bed.

1912
02:43:35,841 --> 02:43:37,036
Not here.

1913
02:43:37,602 --> 02:43:39,081
Not this night.

1914
02:43:39,482 --> 02:43:41,916
Not like this.
Do you understand me?

1915
02:43:44,762 --> 02:43:46,480
I can't feel my body.

1916
02:43:48,603 --> 02:43:52,391
Winning that ticket was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

1917
02:43:54,203 --> 02:43:55,921
It brought me to you.

1918
02:43:57,564 --> 02:43:59,794
And I'm thankful for that, Rose.

1919
02:44:00,484 --> 02:44:01,883
I'm thankful.

1920
02:44:03,924 --> 02:44:06,313
You must ...

1921
02:44:07,444 --> 02:44:09,003
do me this honor.

1922
02:44:12,045 --> 02:44:14,843
You must promise me that you'll survive.

1923
02:44:16,285 --> 02:44:18,594
That you won't give up ...

1924
02:44:19,886 --> 02:44:21,763
no matter what happens.

1925
02:44:24,206 --> 02:44:26,162
No matter how hopeless.

1926
02:44:29,767 --> 02:44:31,485
Promise me now, Rose.

1927
02:44:33,927 --> 02:44:36,236
And never let go of that promise.

1928
02:44:37,567 --> 02:44:38,841
I promise.

1929
02:44:41,088 --> 02:44:42,521
Never let go.

1930
02:44:45,328 --> 02:44:47,239
I'll never let go, Jack.

1931
02:44:50,048 --> 02:44:51,641
I'll never let go.

1932
02:45:14,811 --> 02:45:16,403
Right ahead, sir.

1933
02:45:19,371 --> 02:45:20,406
Oars!

1934
02:45:21,131 --> 02:45:22,928
Do you see any moving?

1935
02:45:23,812 --> 02:45:25,723
No, sir. None moving, sir.

1936
02:45:26,252 --> 02:45:27,571
Check them.

1937
02:45:27,892 --> 02:45:29,723
Bring that oar up here.

1938
02:45:35,533 --> 02:45:37,364
Check them. Make sure.

1939
02:45:37,733 --> 02:45:39,485
These are dead, sir.

1940
02:45:39,973 --> 02:45:42,248
Now give way. Ahead easy.

1941
02:45:48,974 --> 02:45:51,647
Careful with your oars.
Don't hit them.

1942
02:45:54,454 --> 02:45:56,685
Is there anyone alive out there?

1943
02:45:58,215 --> 02:46:00,126
Can anyone hear me?

1944
02:46:02,015 --> 02:46:04,245
Is there anyone alive out there?

1945
02:46:10,976 --> 02:46:12,455
We waited too long.

1946
02:46:16,296 --> 02:46:18,652
Keep checking them! Keep looking!

1947
02:46:20,017 --> 02:46:22,247
Is there anyone alive out there?

1948
02:46:25,737 --> 02:46:27,409

There's a boat.

1956
02:47:50,985 --> 02:47:52,020
Jack?

1957
02:48:16,308 --> 02:48:18,026
There's a boat, Jack.

1958
02:48:59,992 --> 02:49:01,266
Come back.

1959
02:49:10,673 --> 02:49:11,947
Come back!

1960
02:49:16,593 --> 02:49:18,231
Hello!

1961
02:49:19,673 --> 02:49:21,505
Can anyone hear me?

1962
02:49:22,434 --> 02:49:24,390
There's nothing here, sir.

1963
02:49:26,194 --> 02:49:27,468
Come back.

1964
02:49:37,675 --> 02:49:40,428
I'll never let go. I promise.

1965
02:50:22,359 --> 02:50:23,678
Come about!

1966
02:50:44,321 --> 02:50:47,519
1,500 people went into the sea ...

1967
02:50:48,042 --> 02:50:50,875
when Titanic sank from under us.

1968
02:50:52,922 --> 02:50:55,675
There were 20 boats floating nearby ...

1969
02:50:57,002 --> 02:50:58,880
and only one came back.

1970
02:51:01,083 --> 02:51:02,072
One.

1971
02:51:03,803 --> 02:51:06,237
6 were saved from the water ...

1972
02:51:06,603 --> 02:51:08,162
myself included.

1973
02:51:09,564 --> 02:51:13,842
6 out of 1,500.

1974
02:51:17,004 --> 02:51:21,157
Afterward,
the 700 people in the boats ...

1975
02:51:21,525 --> 02:51:23,834
had nothing to do but wait.

1976
02:51:25,605 --> 02:51:28,597
Wait to die, wait to live.

1977
02:51:30,086 --> 02:51:32,156
Wait for an absolution ...

1978
02:51:32,646 --> 02:51:34,557
that would never come.

1979
02:52:36,172 --> 02:52:38,447
Sir, I don't think you'll find
any of your people down here.

1980
02:52:38,532 --> 02:52:40,124
It's all steerage.

1981
02:52:45,013 --> 02:52:47,846
His hair is reddish brown,
and a white beard.

1982
02:52:47,973 --> 02:52:50,771
- Isn't there another passenger list?
- There's no other list.

1983
02:52:50,853 --> 02:52:54,163
- Perhaps he's on another ship.
- We're doing all we can.

1984
02:53:16,896 --> 02:53:19,410
That's the last time I ever saw him.

1985
02:53:19,616 --> 02:53:22,688
He married, of course,
and inherited his millions.

1986
02:53:23,856 --> 02:53:26,973
But the crash of '29
hit his interests hard.

1987
02:53:27,376 --> 02:53:29,937
And he put a pistol
in his mouth that year.

1988
02:53:30,257 --> 02:53:31,656
Or so I read.

1989
02:53:44,258 --> 02:53:46,374
Can I take your name, please, love?

1990
02:53:48,658 --> 02:53:49,774
Dawson.

1991
02:53:52,019 --> 02:53:53,372
Rose Dawson.

1992
02:53:54,459 --> 02:53:55,733
Thank you.

1993
02:54:02,420 --> 02:54:06,254
We never found anything on Jack.
There's no record of him at all.

1994
02:54:07,220 --> 02:54:09,097
No, there wouldn't be, would there?

1995
02:54:09,740 --> 02:54:14,257
And I've never spoken of him
until now. Not to anyone.

1996
02:54:15,061 --> 02:54:17,131
Not even your grandfather.

1997
02:54:17,421 --> 02:54:20,697
A woman's heart
is a deep ocean of secrets.

1998
02:54:22,022 --> 02:54:25,298
But now you know there was a
man named Jack Dawson ...

1999
02:54:25,782 --> 02:54:27,579
and that he saved me ...

2000
02:54:28,062 --> 02:54:30,815
in every way
that a person can be saved.

2001
02:54:33,063 --> 02:54:35,452
I don't even have a picture of him.

2002
02:54:38,023 --> 02:54:41,732
He exists now only in my memory.

2003
02:54:46,584 --> 02:54:49,303
Keldysh, Mir-2 on our way
to the surface.

2004
02:55:05,786 --> 02:55:08,698
I was saving this
for when I found the diamond.

2005
02:55:17,467 --> 02:55:18,741
I'm sorry.

2006
02:55:21,427 --> 02:55:22,746
3 years.

2007
02:55:23,387 --> 02:55:26,027
I've thought of nothing
except Titanic.

2008
02:55:26,628 --> 02:55:28,346
But I never got it.

2009
02:55:31,323 --> 02:55:32,915
