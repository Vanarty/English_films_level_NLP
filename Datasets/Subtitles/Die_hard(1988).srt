1
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,300
You don't like flying, do you?

2
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,800
What gives you that idea?

3
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:08,600
You want to know the secret
to surviving air travel?

4
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:11,400
After you get where you're going,
take off your shoes and socks.

5
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:16,100
Then you walk around on the rug barefoot
and make fists with your toes.

6
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:19,500
Fists with your toes?

7
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,000
I know. It sounds crazy.

8
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:24,000
Trust me.
I've been doing it for nine years.

9
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:28,600
Yes, sir! Better than a shower
and a hot cup of coffee.

10
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:29,700
OK.

11
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,500
It's OK. I'm a cop.

12
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:47,800
Trust me.
I've been doing this for 11 years.

13
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,200
On behalf of the captain and the crew,

14
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,600
I'd like to welcome you to Los Angeles.

15
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,400
Have a very merry Christmas.

16
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:08,400
Flight 247 to Tucson
now boarding at gate 14.

17
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:15,000
Flight 247 to Tucson
now boarding at gate 14.

18
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,100
How do you do?

19
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:45,100
Ladies and gentlemen...

20
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,600
Ladies and gentlemen!

21
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:49,700
I want to congratulate
each and every one of you

22
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:52,300
for making this
one of the greatest years

23
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:54,900
in the history
of the Nakatomi Corporation.

24
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,600
On behalf of the Chief
Executive Officer, Mr Ozu,

25
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,900
and the Board of Directors,

26
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,800
we thank you one and all

27
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:08,200
and wish you a merry Christmas
and a happy New Year!

28
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:11,800
Merry Christmas!
Happy New Year!

29
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:15,900
Hey, Holly.
What about dinner tonight?

30
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,600
Harry, it's Christmas Eve.

31
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:21,800
Families, stockings...

32
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:25,200
Chestnuts?

33
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:27,100
Rudolph and Frosty?

34
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,200
Any of these things ring a bell?

35
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:30,900
Actually, I was thinking more of

36
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,600
mulled wine, a nice aged Brie

37
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:38,800
and a roaring fireplace.
You know what I'm saying?

38
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,200
Ginny, it's 5.40. Go join the party.
Have some champagne.

39
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:46,800
You're making me feel
like Ebenezer Scrooge.

40
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:50,600
Thanks. Do you think the baby
can handle a little sip?

41
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:53,700
That baby's ready to tend bar.

42
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,200
Last chance.

43
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:57,200
Bye.

44
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:06,100
McClane residence.
Lucy McClane speaking.

45
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:10,200
Hello, Lucy McClane.
This is your mother speaking.

46
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:13,100
Mommy!
When are you coming home?

47
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,300
Pretty soon.

48
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,700
You'll be in bed
when I get there, though.

49
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,300
Let me talk to Paulina, OK, hon?

50
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:24,700
And no snooping around the house
looking for presents.

51
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,300
Is Daddy coming home with you?

52
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,900
Well, we'll see what

53
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,500
Santa and Mommy can do, OK?

54
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,100
Put Paulina on. Bye, honey.

55
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,700
Paulina!

56
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,700
Hola, Mrs Holly.

57
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,400
Um, did Mr McClane call?

58
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:50,100
No, Mrs Holly. No telefono.

59
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,500
He probably didn't have time
before his flight.

60
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,400
It might be a good idea
to make up the spare bedroom

61
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,500
just in case.

62
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,600
Si, Mrs Holly. I do that already.

63
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,800
What would I do without you, Paulina?

64
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,300
California!

65
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,100
Hey, I'm John McClane.

66
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,200
Argyle.

67
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,200
I'm your limo driver.

68
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,500
Nice bear.

69
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,200
OK... Argyle.

70
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,100
What do we do now?

71
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:05,100
I was, uh, hoping you could tell me.

72
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,100
It's my first time driving a limo.

73
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:10,200
That's OK.
It's my first time riding in one.

74
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:13,000
Relax.
We got everything in this mug, man.

75
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,700
Look at this... CD, CB, TV,

76
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,900
telephone, full bar, VHS.

77
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,200
If your friend's hot to trot,

78
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:24,100
I know a few mama bears
we can hook up with.

79
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,800
Or is he married?

80
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,500
He's married.

81
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,600
OK.

82
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:35,500
Sorry about that.
It's the girl's day off.

83
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:38,000
I didn't know
you were gonna sit up front.

84
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,600
Your lady live out here?

85
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,800
About the past six months.

86
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,900
Meaning you still live in New York?

87
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:48,800
You always ask
this many questions, Argyle?

88
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:52,500
Sorry. I used to drive a cab
and people would expect a little chitchat.

89
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:56,900
- So, you divorced?
- Just drive the car, man.

90
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,800
Hey, come on. You divorced?
You separated? She beat you up!?

91
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:07,800
She had a good job.
It turned into a great career.

92
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,200
- That meant she had to move here.
- You're very fast, Argyle.

93
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,600
So, why didn't you come?

94
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,800
Well?

95
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,400
Why didn't you come with her?

96
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,500
Because I'm a New York cop.

97
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:27,600
I got a backlog of New York scumbags
I'm still trying to put behind bars.

98
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:29,600
I can't just go that easy.

99
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:32,200
You thought she wasn't
gonna make it out here

100
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:36,600
and she'd come crawling back to you
so why bother to pack, right?

101
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:39,700
Like I said, you're very fast, Argyle.

102
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,300
Mind if we hear some tunes?

103
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,200
Hey, that'll work.

104
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,300
Don't you got any Christmas music?

105
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:54,100
This is Christmas music.

106
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:25,800
So your lady sees you,
you run into each other's arms,

107
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:29,400
the music comes up
and you live happily ever after, right?

108
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:31,400
I can live with that.

109
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:35,800
So, if it doesn't work out,
you got a place to stay?

110
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,500
I'll find a place.

111
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,600
I tell you what...

112
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:44,600
I'll wait in the parking garage. You score,
give me a call on the car phone.

113
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:49,600
I'll take your bags to the desk.
You strike out, I'll get you a hotel.

114
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:54,200
- You're all right, Argyle.
- Remember that when you sign for the tip.

115
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,800
- Hi.
- Good evening.

116
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,500
I'm here to see Holly McClane.

117
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:25,100
Just type it in there.

118
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,600
Cute toy.

119
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:35,100
Yeah, if you have to take a leak,
it'll even help you find your zipper.

120
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:53,800
Christ.

121
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:01,000
- Thirtieth floor?
- The party.

122
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,900
They're the only ones
left in the building.

123
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,500
Take the express elevator.

124
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,600
Get off where you hear the noise.

125
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,500
Thanks.

126
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:09,200
- Champagne, sir?
- Yeah, thanks.

127
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,500
Oh, I'm sorry.

128
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,600
Hey! Merry Christmas!

129
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,000
Jesus.

130
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,200
Fuckin' California!

131
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:58,500
I couldn't agree with you more.

132
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,700
Why don't I talk to him right now?

133
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,200
Hi. I'm looking for...

134
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,700
- Holly Gennero.
- Yeah.

135
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,800
Then you must be John McClane.

136
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,200
Joe Takagi.
How was your ride in?

137
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:12,800
Nice. I have you to thank for that?

138
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:15,100
Seemed the least we could do.

139
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,800
- Quite a place you have here.
- It will be if we ever get it finished.

140
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:20,900
Still several floors under construction.

141
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,400
Holly went to fax some documents.
She should be back any minute.

142
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:29,100
In the meanwhile,
her office is back here.

143
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,400
Ellis?

144
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:36,800
I was just making a call.
This was the nearest phone.

145
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I want you to meet John McClane,

146
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,700
Holly's husband.

147
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:42,900
Holly's policeman.

148
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:45,300
Ellis is in charge
of international development.

149
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,900
Heard a lot about you.

150
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,700
You missed some.

151
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,000
Can I get you anything?

152
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:56,200
Food? Cake?
Some watered-down champagne?

153
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:58,300
No, thank you. I'm fine.

154
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,500
You throw quite a party.

155
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,900
I didn't realize they celebrated
Christmas in Japan.

156
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:07,100
We're flexible.

157
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,100
Pearl Harbor didn't work out,
so we got you with tape decks.

158
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:16,800
It's sort of a double celebration.
We closed a pretty big deal today

159
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:19,300
and a lot of it was due to Holly.
Right, Joe?

160
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:22,000
I'll be out in a couple of minutes.

161
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,500
John.

162
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,600
Have you met everyone?

163
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,700
We've been sticking him with spears.

164
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,800
Of course he has.

165
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,900
She was made for the business.
Tough as nails.

166
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,400
I was hoping you made that flight.

167
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,600
Show him the watch.

168
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,200
Later.

169
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:50,400
Show him. Are you embarrassed?

170
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,500
It's just a small token of appreciation

171
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,200
for all her hard work. It's a Rolex.

172
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:58,700
I'm sure I'll see it later.

173
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,000
Is there a place
where I could wash up?

174
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:02,800
Sure.

175
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,300
You have to forgive Ellis.

176
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,900
He gets very depressed
this time of year.

177
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:26,700
He thought he was
God's greatest gift, you know?

178
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,000
I know the type.

179
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,900
I think he's got his eye on you.

180
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:36,000
That's OK. I have my eye
on his private bathroom.

181
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:39,300
Where are you staying?
Things happened so fast

182
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:42,100
I didn't get a chance
to ask you on the phone.

183
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,700
Cappy Roberts retired out here.

184
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,900
Oh, yeah?

185
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,600
He said I could bunk with him.

186
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:50,000
Cappy retired, huh?
Where's he live?

187
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:53,300
- Romona.
- Ha! Pomona.

188
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
- Huh?
- Pomona.

189
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,900
- Pomona.
- Yeah.

190
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:01,200
You'll be in the car half the time.

191
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:05,100
Why don't we make it easy?
I have a spare bedroom.

192
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,900
It's not huge or anything, but

193
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,500
the kids would love to have you
at the house.

194
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,200
They would, huh?

195
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,800
I would, too.

196
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,500
Sorry.

197
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:35,000
I missed you.

198
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,500
Didn't miss my name, though, huh?

199
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:47,500
Except maybe
when you're signing checks?

200
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,700
Since when did you start using
Ms Gennero?

201
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:56,100
This is a Japanese company.
They figure a married woman's...

202
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:58,400
You are a married woman.

203
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:01,300
This conversation again?
We did this in July.

204
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,600
We never finished this conversation.

205
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:06,000
I had an opportunity. I had to take it.

206
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:08,900
No matter what it did to our marriage.

207
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,300
It only changed your idea
of our marriage.

208
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,100
You have no clue what my idea...

209
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:16,800
I know exactly what your idea
of our marriage should be.

210
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:18,700
Ms Gennero, I...

211
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,100
Excuse me.

212
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,000
Hi.

213
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:27,400
Um, Mr Takagi is looking for you.

214
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:30,000
He wants you to say something
to the troops.

215
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:30,900
Thank you.

216
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,500
Speech time.

217
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,400
Be back in a few minutes.

218
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:52,800
That was great, John.

219
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:55,900
Good job. Very mature.

220
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,800
So Kareem rebounds.

221
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:50,700
Feeds Worthy on the break,
over to AC, to Magic,

222
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,000
then back to Worthy.

223
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,200
Boom! Two points.

224
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,600
We're in.

225
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:31,400
Links,

226
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:35,500
rechts,

227
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,300
und wieder links.

228
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,400
Son of a bitch.

229
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,800
Fists with your toes.

230
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:47,400
Yeah, Argyle?

231
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,200
How's it going?

232
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:50,600
All right. Where are you?

233
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:53,600
Down at the garage.
What's with you and your lady?

234
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:56,000
The vote's not in yet.

235
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:07,200
- Hey, Bruder.
- Moment.

236
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,300
Nein! Nein! Nein!

237
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:28,900
Argyle?

238
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,600
Mac, you there? Hello?

239
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,400
You know the number. Use it.

240
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,600
Stay calm.
Everything's going to be fine.

241
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,300
Everything's going to be fine.

242
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:40,100
Shit!

243
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,600
Think.

244
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,500
Think.

245
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,700
Ladies and gentlemen.

246
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,100
Ladies and gentlemen.

247
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:19,700
Due to the Nakatomi Corporation's
legacy of greed around the globe

248
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:23,700
they're about to be taught a lesson
in the real use of power.

249
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:27,300
You will be witnesses.

250
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:30,500
Now

251
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,500
where is Mr Takagi?

252
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:39,500
Joseph Yashinobo Takagi,

253
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
born Kyoto, 1937

254
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,900
Don't move.

255
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:49,100
Family emigrated to San Pedro,
California, 1939,

256
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:55,000
interned at Manzanar, 1942 to '43,

257
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:00,000
scholarship student,
University of California,

258
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:02,500
1955.

259
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:10,600
Law degree, Stanford, 1962.

260
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:14,400
MBA, Harvard, 1970.

261
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:18,300
President, Nakatomi Trading.

262
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,700
Vice Chairman,
Nakatomi Investment Group...

263
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:22,900
Enough.

264
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,100
And father

265
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,500
of five.

266
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,400
I am Takagi.

267
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:33,000
How do you do?

268
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,300
It's a pleasure to meet you.

269
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:50,700
OK, 32... construction,
33... computers.

270
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,700
Nice suit.

271
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,500
John Phillips, London.

272
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,900
I have two myself.

273
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:16,500
Rumor has it
Arafat buys his there.

274
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:24,100
- This way?
- On the left.

275
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:50,100
And when Alexander saw
the breadth of his domain

276
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:54,000
he wept, for there were
no more worlds to conquer.

277
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:01,300
The benefits of a classical education.

278
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:04,600
Ohh, that's beautiful.

279
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,900
I always enjoyed to make models
when I was a boy.

280
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,800
The exactness, the attention
to every conceivable detail.

281
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,100
It's beautiful.

282
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:20,400
Is this what this is all about?
Our project in Indonesia?

283
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:24,300
Contrary to what you people may think,

284
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:27,900
we're going to develop
that region, not exploit it.

285
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,600
I believe you.
I read the article in Forbes.

286
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,000
Mr Takagi,

287
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:41,400
I could talk about industrialization
and men's fashions all day

288
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:43,600
but I'm afraid work must intrude

289
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:46,800
and my associate here
has some questions for you.

290
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,600
Sort of fill-in-the-blanks questions,
actually.

291
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,800
I don't have that code.

292
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:05,200
You broke in here
to access our computer?

293
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,500
Any information you could get

294
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,800
when they wake up in Tokyo,
they'll change it.

295
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:12,800
You won't be able to blackmail
our executives...

296
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:15,000
Sit... down!

297
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:28,500
Mr Takagi, I'm really not
interested in your computer.

298
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:35,200
But I need the code key

299
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:40,300
because I am interested
in the $640 million

300
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:45,200
in negotiable bearer bonds
that you have locked in your vault

301
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:48,900
and the computer
controls the vault.

302
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:52,100
You want money?

303
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:55,000
What kind of terrorists are you?

304
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:00,700
Who said we were terrorists?

305
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:23,000
The bonds represent, at most

306
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:26,900
10 days' operating capital
for your parent organization.

307
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,300
It's really no more
than a temporary inconvenience.

308
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,400
Now...

309
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,600
the code, please.

310
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:39,900
It's useless to you.

311
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,400
There are seven safeguards on our vault
and the code key's only one of them.

312
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:44,900
You'll never get it open.

313
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,500
Then there's no reason
not to tell it to us.

314
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:52,300
- I told you.
- It's not over yet.

315
00:30:56,900 --> 00:31:00,500
It's a very nice suit, Mr Takagi.

316
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:04,500
It would be a shame to ruin it.

317
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:09,100
I'm going to count to three.

318
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:13,100
There will not be a four.

319
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,900
Give me the code.

320
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:18,100
One,

321
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,400
two,

322
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,500
- three,
- I don't know it.

323
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,500
Get on a jet to Tokyo
and ask the chairman.

324
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,200
You're just gonna have to kill me.

325
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:32,500
OK.

326
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,000
We do it the hard way.

327
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:40,100
Tony, see if you can dispose of that.

328
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:43,500
Karl, you better check on Heinrich's work
up on the machine floor.

329
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:09,900
Nothing.

330
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,400
See to Heinrich.

331
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,400
Now

332
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:18,300
you can break the code?

333
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:24,100
You didn't bring me
for my charming personality.

334
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:31,500
Argyle, tell me you heard the shots.

335
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,200
You're calling the police right now.

336
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,600
Of course I'm still coming by later.

337
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Sweetheart, have I ever lied to you?

338
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:42,300
My boss? He thinks
I'm on my way to Vegas.

339
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:46,200
Uli, get up on the pipes.

340
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:48,900
Marco, you go through here.

341
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:52,500
I'll throw you the cord.

342
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:58,200
Hans, we're on the roof.

343
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:13,000
Here.

344
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:17,700
Uli.

345
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:27,300
30 minutes to break the code,

346
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:31,900
two hours, two and a half hours
for the five mechanicals, at the minimum.

347
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,200
The 7th lock, however,
is out of my hands.

348
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:59,300
I'm sorry?

349
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:02,200
The 7th lock...
the electromagnetic seal.

350
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:05,300
You do understand the circuits
cannot be cut locally?

351
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:08,300
Trust me.

352
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:13,200
Why the fuck
didn't you stop him, John?

353
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:17,100
'Cause then you'd be dead, too,
asshole.

354
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:19,200
Think, goddamn it! Think!

355
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,300
We've got a fire alarm.

356
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:35,600
Call 911.

357
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:39,600
Give them the guard's name
and cancel the alarm.

358
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:41,000
Then disable the sys...

359
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:47,400
Eddie, on what floor
did the alarm go off?

360
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:51,000
Shall we go?

361
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,500
Nein.

362
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,800
Yes.

363
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,800
Hello, baby.
Come to Papa. Come on.

364
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:10,200
Ah ha ha ha!

365
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:13,200
Come on, baby.

366
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:14,800
Come on, baby.

367
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:16,200
Come on, baby. Come to Papa.

368
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:18,800
I'll kiss your fuckin' Dalmatian.

369
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,900
You stupid motherfuckers!
No! No!

370
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,400
Turn the fuckin' truck around!

371
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:03,000
The fire has been called off, my friend.

372
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:10,000
No-one is coming to help you.

373
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,200
You might as well come out
and join the others.

374
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:22,000
I promise I won't hurt you.

375
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:54,600
Drop it, dickhead. It's the police.

376
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:56,500
You won't hurt me.

377
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:58,300
Yeah? Why not?

378
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,300
Because you're a policeman.

379
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,800
There are rules for policemen.

380
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:06,400
Yeah, that's what my captain
keeps telling me.

381
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:15,200
Bet your ass I wish to proceed.

382
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,500
Nine million terrorists in the world

383
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:00,800
and I got to kill one with feet
smaller than my sister.

384
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:52,600
I wanted this to be professional,

385
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:54,700
efficient, adult, cooperative.

386
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:55,900
Not a lot to ask.

387
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:59,000
Alas, your Mr Takagi
did not see it that way

388
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:02,700
so he won't be joining us
for the rest of his life.

389
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:06,800
We can go any way you want it.

390
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,900
You can walk out of here
or be carried out

391
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:15,000
but have no illusions...
we are in charge.

392
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:20,400
So... decide now, each of you

393
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:22,500
and please remember

394
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:26,100
we have left nothing to chance.

395
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,900
It's Tony!

396
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:35,800
Get them back!

397
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:48,100
Now I have a machine gun.

398
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:53,000
Ho... ho... ho.

399
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:57,900
A security guard we missed?

400
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:03,100
They're usually tired old policemen.
No, this is something else.

401
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,900
We have to do something, Hans.

402
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,300
Yes, we do.

403
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,800
Tell Karl his brother is dead.

404
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:20,800
Tell him to come down.

405
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,400
Karl... komm sofort.

406
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:27,200
Franco, Fritz, take the body upstairs

407
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:28,500
and out of sight.

408
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:31,400
I don't want the hostages
to think too much.

409
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,500
Komm sofort. Schnell.

410
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:37,500
I want blood!

411
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:40,600
You'll have it, but let
Heinrich plant the detonators

412
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:43,300
and Theo prepare the vault.
After we call the police,

413
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:46,600
you can tear the building apart
looking for this man

414
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:49,500
but until then,
do not alter the plan!

415
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:52,200
And if he alters it?

416
00:42:57,100 --> 00:42:59,000
What do you think?

417
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:03,000
Something's wrong.

418
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:04,500
Cops?

419
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,800
- John.
- John?

420
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,300
He can fuck this whole thing up.

421
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:12,700
What does he think he's doing?

422
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,000
His job.

423
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:17,800
Bullshit.
His job's 3,000 miles away.

424
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:21,100
Without him, we still have
a chance to get out of here.

425
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:24,700
Tell that to Takagi.

426
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:50,500
Mayday, Mayday,
anyone copying channel nine.

427
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:53,100
Terrorists have seized
the Nakatomi building

428
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:54,600
and are holding
at least 30 people hostage.

429
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:56,800
I repeat.
Unknown number of terrorists

430
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:59,000
six or more
armed with automatic weapons

431
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,200
at Nakatomi Plaza,

432
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:01,300
Century City.

433
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:04,200
Where's the best place to transmit?

434
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:04,900
The roof!

435
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,400
Go! Go!

436
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,600
It's the same address
as that fire signal.

437
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:14,100
I'll handle it.

438
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:17,400
Attention, whoever you are,

439
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:20,000
this channel is reserved
for emergency calls only.

440
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:23,100
No fucking shit, lady!
Do I sound like I'm ordering a pizza?

441
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:38,900
No-one kills him but me.

442
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:41,700
They have already killed one hostage.

443
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:44,900
They are fortifying their positions
while you're jerkin' me off on the radio!

444
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:47,300
Sir, I've already told you.

445
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:49,000
This is a reserved channel.

446
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:52,900
If this is an emergency call,
dial 911 on your telephone.

447
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,600
Otherwise, I'll report this
as an FCC violation.

448
00:44:56,700 --> 00:44:59,200
Fine! Report me!
Come the fuck down here and arrest me!

449
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:00,600
Just send the police now!

450
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:17,700
See if a black and white can drive by.

451
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:31,500
Thought you guys just ate doughnuts.

452
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,900
- They're for my wife.
- Yeah.

453
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:39,700
- She's pregnant.
- Yeah.

454
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:41,700
Bag it.

455
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:44,600
Big time.

456
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:49,000
Thanks.

457
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,400
Dispatch to 8-Lincoln-30. Over.

458
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:56,500
This is 8-Lincoln-30.

459
00:45:56,500 --> 00:46:00,800
Investigate a code two
at Nakatomi Plaza, Century City.

460
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:04,900
8-Lincoln-30 to Dispatch.
I'm on my way.

461
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:04,300
Girls.

462
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,100
Shit! Where the fuck is it?

463
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:46,100
Oh, my God.

464
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,200
He's in the elevator shaft.

465
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:05,700
Perfect.

466
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:08,200
The elevators are locked off.
He can't escape.

467
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:10,000
Just shut him in
and come back down.

468
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:15,100
Oh, fuck.

469
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,400
Karl, the police are probably
on their way

470
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:24,400
already.

471
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:25,300
Karl?

472
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:47,600
Christ.

473
00:49:52,900 --> 00:49:55,200
I can stall them,
but not if they hear gunshots.

474
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:57,800
If you lock him in,
he'll be neutralized...

475
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:04,200
"Come out to the coast!"

476
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:06,400
"We'll get together,
have a few laughs."

477
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:16,400
Now I know
what a TV dinner feels like.

478
00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:27,900
Such!

479
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:26,100
Karl, komm! Die Polizei!

480
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:28,000
Karl, die Polizei!

481
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:14,900
Well, it's about time.

482
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:21,900
No signs of disturbance, Dispatch.

483
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,400
Roger. Possible crank call.

484
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:26,200
Check the area again and confirm.

485
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:35,000
Who's driving this car,
Stevie Wonder?

486
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:38,700
I do see a guard inside.

487
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:41,700
I'm gonna go in for a closer look.

488
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:43,100
Use caution.

489
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:47,300
Eddie?

490
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:50,200
I had a feelin' you'd be calling.

491
00:54:13,700 --> 00:54:16,200
Evenin', officer.
What can I do for you?

492
00:54:27,700 --> 00:54:29,600
We had that false alarm.

493
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:31,900
You ask me, that goddamn
computer sent you

494
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,900
on another wild-goose chase.

495
00:54:33,900 --> 00:54:37,400
They been chasing bugs in this system
ever since they installed it.

496
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:39,800
..Notre Dame on top of USC.

497
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:41,700
Aw, shit!

498
00:54:41,700 --> 00:54:44,300
I got 50 bucks bet on them assholes.

499
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:50,100
Come on, come on,
where's the fucking cavalry?

500
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:16,000
..was good for 52 yards.

501
00:55:16,100 --> 00:55:18,200
Mind if I look around?

502
00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:19,700
Help yourself.

503
00:55:19,700 --> 00:55:22,400
27 seconds left in this first period.
Seven to nothing, Notre Dame.

504
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:25,500
The Irish driving 74 yards
in eight plays...

505
00:55:28,100 --> 00:55:29,100
I'll put this fuckin'...

506
00:55:29,700 --> 00:55:31,200
Freeze, motherfucker! Drop it!

507
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:32,400
Don't shoot!

508
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:35,300
- Put the gun down!
- OK! Don't shoot!

509
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:36,600
Drop that fuckin' gun!

510
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:38,200
Marco, down!

511
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:56,800
Ah, to hell with this!

512
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:07,500
You are done!

513
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:10,700
No more table!
Where are you going, pal?

514
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:13,300
Next time you have a chance
to kill someone,

515
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:15,000
don't hesitate.

516
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:24,300
Thanks for the advice.

517
00:56:24,700 --> 00:56:28,100
- Sorry to waste your time.
- No problem at all.

518
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:30,800
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas to you.

519
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:40,200
Oh, the weather outside is frightful

520
00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:42,700
Dum de dum delightful

521
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:47,000
Oh, for the love...

522
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:52,300
8-Lincoln-30 to Dispatch.

523
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:53,400
Go ahead.

524
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:56,000
A wild-goose chase
over here at Nakatomi Plaza.

525
00:56:56,100 --> 00:56:58,000
Everything here's OK. Over.

526
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,800
But nobody has no place to go

527
00:57:01,900 --> 00:57:05,100
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

528
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:07,700
Shit!

529
00:57:07,900 --> 00:57:09,600
Goddamn it! Jesus H Christ!

530
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:19,400
Welcome to the party, pal!

531
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:20,900
Goddamn it!

532
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:29,800
Get someone here now, goddamn it!

533
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:32,400
Policeman under automatic
rifle fire at Nakatomi!

534
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:34,500
I need backup assistance now!

535
00:57:35,900 --> 00:57:37,200
Now, goddamn it! Now!

536
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:57,700
Monica, I can get us a table.

537
00:57:58,900 --> 00:58:01,400
Wolfgang and I
are very close friends.

538
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:03,600
I interviewed him, for God's sake.

539
00:58:03,700 --> 00:58:05,400
..Nakatomi.

540
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:08,200
Repeat.
Officer needs assistance at...

541
00:58:08,300 --> 00:58:09,700
I'm at Nakatomi Plaza.

542
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:12,000
They're turning my car
into Swiss cheese!

543
00:58:12,100 --> 00:58:13,700
I need backup assistance now!

544
00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:16,100
Now, goddamn it! Now!

545
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
Never thought
I'd love to hear that sound.

546
00:58:39,100 --> 00:58:40,700
All of you relax.

547
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:43,700
This is a matter
of inconvenient timing, that's all.

548
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:45,700
Police action was inevitable

549
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:48,500
and, as it happens, necessary.

550
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:52,100
So, let them fumble about outside
and stay calm.

551
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:53,800
This is simply the beginning.

552
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:59,000
I told you all I wanted
radio silence until...

553
00:58:59,100 --> 00:59:01,700
I'm very sorry, Hans.
I didn't get that message.

554
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:05,200
Maybe you should have put it
on the bulletin board.

555
00:59:05,300 --> 00:59:07,700
I figured since I waxed Tony
and Marco and his friend here,

556
00:59:07,900 --> 00:59:10,700
I figured you and Karl
and Franco might be lonely

557
00:59:10,700 --> 00:59:12,700
so I wanted to give you a call.

558
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:15,000
How does he know
so much about us?

559
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:18,500
That's very kind of you.

560
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:22,000
I assume you are
our mysterious party crasher.

561
00:59:22,700 --> 00:59:24,100
You are most troublesome

562
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:26,000
for a security guard.

563
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:29,200
Eeeh! Sorry, Hans. Wrong guess.

564
00:59:29,300 --> 00:59:32,000
Would you like to go for double jeopardy
where the scores can really change?

565
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:39,500
Mm, these are very bad for you.

566
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:41,900
Who are you, then?

567
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,300
Just the fly in the ointment, Hans.

568
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:45,700
The monkey in the wrench,

569
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:47,800
the pain in the ass.

570
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:51,300
Whoa!

571
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,400
Check on all the others.
Don't use the radio.

572
00:59:55,500 --> 00:59:56,900
See if he's lying about Marco

573
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,600
and find out
if anyone else is missing.

574
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:05,400
Mr Mystery Guest,

575
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:08,200
are you still there?

576
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:10,600
Yeah, I'm still here

577
01:00:10,700 --> 01:00:13,400
unless you want to open
the front door for me.

578
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:15,400
No, I'm afraid not

579
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:18,300
but you have me at a loss.

580
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:20,200
You know my name, but who are you?

581
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:24,400
Just another American
who saw too many movies as a child?

582
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:27,600
Another orphan
of a bankrupt culture

583
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:30,900
who thinks he's John Wayne,
Rambo, Marshal Dillon?

584
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:35,100
I was always partial
to Roy Rogers, actually.

585
01:00:35,700 --> 01:00:37,500
I liked those sequined shirts.

586
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:40,800
Do you really think you have
a chance against us, Mr Cowboy?

587
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,100
Yippee-ki-yay, motherfucker.

588
01:00:49,900 --> 01:00:52,200
I'll beat everyone if I get a remote.

589
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:54,000
Sam, I don't have the new pages.

590
01:00:54,100 --> 01:00:56,400
Harvey, keep your pants on.

591
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:58,200
Sam, I'm begging you.

592
01:00:58,300 --> 01:01:01,500
Simon's with the remote.
I'll tell him to swing by.

593
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:03,400
I won't sit on this!

594
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:06,300
This is my story!
I'm going out there!

595
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:08,000
Look, Sam. Tell you what.

596
01:01:08,100 --> 01:01:10,300
You don't give me a truck,
I'll steal a truck.

597
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:11,500
Give us a break, Thornburg.

598
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:12,800
Eat it, Harvey!

599
01:01:12,900 --> 01:01:15,500
..four, three, two,

600
01:01:15,500 --> 01:01:16,700
one.

601
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:18,700
Harvey, we're on the air.

602
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,100
Good evening.
This is Harvey Johnson.

603
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:28,700
And I'm Gail Wallens.

604
01:01:28,700 --> 01:01:30,700
This is Nightline News at 10.00.

605
01:01:30,900 --> 01:01:33,600
Our top stories
on this Christmas Eve...

606
01:01:33,700 --> 01:01:36,900
Take truck number five.
Get out of here.

607
01:01:44,700 --> 01:01:47,600
He wasn't lying about Marco.
He's down on the street.

608
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:50,100
The other man was Heinrich

609
01:01:50,600 --> 01:01:52,400
and his bag is missing.

610
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:56,100
He had the detonator.

611
01:02:01,100 --> 01:02:01,900
Theo.

612
01:02:02,700 --> 01:02:03,700
Theo.

613
01:02:03,900 --> 01:02:05,000
Yo!

614
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:08,600
We may have some problems.
How's our schedule?

615
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:10,600
Three down, four to go.

616
01:02:10,700 --> 01:02:12,200
Then don't waste time

617
01:02:12,300 --> 01:02:14,100
talking to me.

618
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:16,300
This is Sergeant Al Powell

619
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:18,100
of the Los Angeles
Police Department.

620
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:19,600
If the person who radioed for help

621
01:02:19,700 --> 01:02:20,800
can hear me on this channel,

622
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:22,900
acknowledge this transmission.

623
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:24,100
I say again,

624
01:02:24,100 --> 01:02:27,500
if the person who radioed
for help can hear me,

625
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:30,000
acknowledge this transmission!

626
01:02:34,300 --> 01:02:36,900
I read you, pal.
You the guy in the car?

627
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
What's left of him.

628
01:02:39,100 --> 01:02:40,700
Can you identify yourself?

629
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:42,500
Not now. Maybe later.

630
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:44,600
Listen fast. This is a party line.

631
01:02:44,700 --> 01:02:46,700
The neighbors got itchy trigger fingers.

632
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:48,300
All right, here's the deal.

633
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:50,200
You got 30 or so hostages
on the 30th floor.

634
01:02:50,300 --> 01:02:51,700
The leader's name is Hans.

635
01:02:51,800 --> 01:02:53,300
We have to find him and shut him up.

636
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:54,500
He's telling them everything!

637
01:02:54,600 --> 01:02:56,600
Let him. I'm waiting for the FBI.

638
01:02:56,700 --> 01:02:58,800
He can waste
as much time as he likes

639
01:02:58,900 --> 01:03:01,200
but we must find the bag, Fritz.

640
01:03:01,300 --> 01:03:03,300
They have a freakin' arsenal here.

641
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:04,700
We must have the detonators.

642
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:07,300
They got missiles, automatic weapons,

643
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:09,500
and enough plastic explosives
to orbit Arnold Schwarzenegger.

644
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,800
They're down to nine now,
counting the skydiver you met.

645
01:03:12,900 --> 01:03:14,700
These guys are mostly European

646
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:17,300
judging by their clothing labels and

647
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:25,700
cigarettes.

648
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:28,400
They're well-financed and very slick.

649
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:30,100
How do you know that?

650
01:03:30,200 --> 01:03:32,000
I've seen enough phony IDs in my time

651
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:35,800
to recognize the ones they got
must have cost a fortune.

652
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:40,600
Add all that up. I don't know
what the fuck it means

653
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:42,700
but you got
some bad-ass perpetrators

654
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:44,200
and they're here to stay.

655
01:03:45,800 --> 01:03:47,300
I hear you, partner.

656
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:48,600
LA's finest are on it,

657
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:50,300
so light 'em if you got 'em.

658
01:03:50,900 --> 01:03:53,700
Way ahead of you, partner.

659
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:56,200
So what do I call you?

660
01:03:57,800 --> 01:03:59,000
Call me...

661
01:04:00,800 --> 01:04:01,700
Roy.

662
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:05,500
Listen up, Roy,
if you think of anything else,

663
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:06,800
don't be shy, OK?

664
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:09,900
In the meantime, find a safe place
and let us do our job.

665
01:04:10,900 --> 01:04:13,200
They're all yours, Al.

666
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:32,000
Who's talking to 'em?

667
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:36,100
I am, sir.
Sergeant Powell. Al Powell.

668
01:04:36,500 --> 01:04:38,500
Dwayne Robinson. What's the deal?

669
01:04:38,600 --> 01:04:40,500
What do these pricks want?

670
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:42,700
If you mean the terrorists,

671
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:44,900
we haven't heard a peep from them.

672
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:46,800
Who have you been talking to?

673
01:04:47,900 --> 01:04:50,700
We don't know.
He won't give us his name.

674
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:53,500
But he appears to be
the one who phoned.

675
01:04:53,600 --> 01:04:56,800
He's killed one terrorist for sure
and claims he capped off two others.

676
01:04:56,900 --> 01:04:58,100
He claims?

677
01:04:58,200 --> 01:05:00,400
Powell, has it occurred to you

678
01:05:00,500 --> 01:05:02,900
he could be
one of the terrorists pulling your chain

679
01:05:02,900 --> 01:05:04,700
or some nutcase in there?

680
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:07,900
I don't think so.
In fact, I think he's a cop,

681
01:05:07,900 --> 01:05:10,700
maybe not LAPD,
But he's definitely a badge.

682
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:14,100
- How do you know that?
- A hunch... things he said

683
01:05:14,200 --> 01:05:16,900
like being able to spot a phony ID.

684
01:05:17,100 --> 01:05:19,100
Jesus Christ, Powell!

685
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:21,700
He could be a fucking bartender
for all we know!

686
01:05:21,800 --> 01:05:23,300
TV's here.

687
01:05:24,300 --> 01:05:25,900
Oh, shit.

688
01:05:42,900 --> 01:05:44,400
I have a request.

689
01:05:44,500 --> 01:05:47,300
What idiot put you in charge?

690
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:48,900
You did

691
01:05:48,900 --> 01:05:51,100
when you murdered my boss.

692
01:05:51,100 --> 01:05:53,200
Now everybody's looking to me.

693
01:05:53,300 --> 01:05:55,900
Personally, I'd pass on the job.

694
01:05:55,900 --> 01:05:59,300
I don't enjoy being this close to you.

695
01:06:07,300 --> 01:06:08,600
Go on.

696
01:06:08,700 --> 01:06:10,700
We have a pregnant woman.

697
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:13,700
Relax. She's not due
for a couple weeks

698
01:06:13,800 --> 01:06:16,900
but sitting on that rock
isn't doing her back any good.

699
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:20,400
So I'd like permission to move her
to an office with a sofa.

700
01:06:21,800 --> 01:06:24,700
No, but I'll have a sofa
brought out. Good enough?

701
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:26,200
Good enough.

702
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:28,300
And unless you like it messy,

703
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:30,600
start bringing us
in groups to the bathroom.

704
01:06:30,700 --> 01:06:33,800
Yes. You're right.

705
01:06:34,700 --> 01:06:36,400
It will be done.

706
01:06:36,600 --> 01:06:38,000
Was there something else?

707
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:42,200
No, thank you.

708
01:06:48,700 --> 01:06:51,500
Mr Takagi
chose his people well, Mrs...?

709
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:53,400
Gennero.

710
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:57,800
Ms Gennero.

711
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:03,000
We interrupt this program
for a special news bulletin.

712
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:06,000
This is Richard Thornburg
live from Century City.

713
01:07:06,200 --> 01:07:09,200
Tonight, Los Angeles has joined

714
01:07:09,300 --> 01:07:12,400
the sad and worldwide
fraternity of cities

715
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:14,400
whose only membership requirement

716
01:07:14,500 --> 01:07:17,600
is to suffer the anguish
of international terrorism.

717
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:22,100
Approximately two hours ago,
an unidentified group of men

718
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:24,800
seized control
of the Nakatomi building,

719
01:07:24,900 --> 01:07:27,200
sealing off all entrances and exits.

720
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:29,200
All telephone lines have been cut

721
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:31,500
and the only communication
now possible

722
01:07:31,600 --> 01:07:34,500
has been through the use
of CB communicators

723
01:07:34,600 --> 01:07:37,000
which the group
apparently brought with them.

724
01:07:37,100 --> 01:07:38,900
According to official sources,

725
01:07:38,900 --> 01:07:41,600
the perpetrators of this building siege...

726
01:07:41,700 --> 01:07:44,400
Unit five,
hold your position in the main entrance.

727
01:07:44,500 --> 01:07:47,100
We got Charlie unit in position

728
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:48,700
by the parking structure.

729
01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:50,600
Let me ask you something.

730
01:07:50,700 --> 01:07:52,800
Does this stairway
go up to the escalator?

731
01:07:52,900 --> 01:07:54,100
Yeah.

732
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:55,900
Tell them to go ahead.

733
01:07:56,700 --> 01:07:58,300
What's going on?

734
01:07:59,100 --> 01:08:01,300
What's it look like? We're going in.

735
01:08:01,300 --> 01:08:04,100
Going in? Man, that's crazy!

736
01:08:04,300 --> 01:08:06,200
There could be over 30 hostages
in there for all we know.

737
01:08:06,300 --> 01:08:08,200
We don't know shit, Powell.

738
01:08:08,300 --> 01:08:11,700
If there's hostages, how come
there were no ransom demands?

739
01:08:11,700 --> 01:08:15,000
If there's terrorists in there,
where's their list of demands?

740
01:08:15,100 --> 01:08:17,300
All we know is that
somebody shot your car up.

741
01:08:17,400 --> 01:08:19,500
It's probably the same silly son of a bitch

742
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:21,700
you've been talking to on that radio.

743
01:08:21,700 --> 01:08:23,400
Excuse me, sir,

744
01:08:23,500 --> 01:08:26,800
but what about the body
that fell out the window?

745
01:08:26,900 --> 01:08:28,700
Probably some stockbroker
got depressed.

746
01:08:28,700 --> 01:08:29,900
We're ready, Chief.

747
01:08:29,900 --> 01:08:32,300
- Light 'em up. Let's go.
- Hit your lights.

748
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:35,300
- Blue units, go.
- Lights on!

749
01:08:47,300 --> 01:08:48,100
Powell?

750
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:52,300
Powell, you still with me, babe?
What's going on?

751
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:54,300
Yo, Al.

752
01:08:54,500 --> 01:08:57,000
I'm here, Roy,
but I'm kind of busy right now.

753
01:08:57,100 --> 01:08:58,200
I'll talk to you later.

754
01:08:58,300 --> 01:08:59,300
Al, what's wrong?

755
01:08:59,300 --> 01:09:01,000
I'll talk to you later.

756
01:09:01,100 --> 01:09:03,100
If you are what I think you are,

757
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:05,700
you'll know when to listen,
shut up, and

758
01:09:07,300 --> 01:09:09,200
and when to pray.

759
01:09:09,300 --> 01:09:11,500
Jesus Christ!
You're coming in, right?

760
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:13,000
Christ, Powell,

761
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,100
I told you what kind of people
you're dealing with here.

762
01:09:15,200 --> 01:09:17,500
Let's load them up.

763
01:09:20,900 --> 01:09:23,400
They'll be coming.
Everyone get ready.

764
01:09:24,300 --> 01:09:26,900
Theo, you are the eyes now.

765
01:09:39,400 --> 01:09:40,600
- Rivers.
- Yo.

766
01:09:40,700 --> 01:09:43,500
Begin your reconnoiter.

767
01:09:44,200 --> 01:09:45,500
Let's go.

768
01:09:48,800 --> 01:09:50,300
Shit!

769
01:10:09,300 --> 01:10:11,500
Come on. Let's go.

770
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:23,200
Ow! Jesus!

771
01:10:57,300 --> 01:10:59,700
All right, spread out.

772
01:11:25,700 --> 01:11:27,200
Shut up.

773
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:30,900
Let's go.

774
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:37,500
You macho assholes. No! No!

775
01:11:40,500 --> 01:11:43,300
Ahem... all right. Listen up, guys.

776
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:46,800
'It was the night before Christmas

777
01:11:46,900 --> 01:11:48,900
and all through the house

778
01:11:48,900 --> 01:11:51,400
not a creature was stirring, except

779
01:11:51,500 --> 01:11:54,500
the four assholes
coming in the rear in standard

780
01:11:54,500 --> 01:11:56,300
two-by-two cover formation.

781
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:00,000
We're all set.

782
01:12:01,500 --> 01:12:03,300
We're ready.

783
01:12:03,500 --> 01:12:04,800
Kick ass.

784
01:12:04,900 --> 01:12:06,000
Go!

785
01:12:06,100 --> 01:12:08,300
Right. Let's do it.

786
01:12:23,700 --> 01:12:25,100
Take cover!

787
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:27,100
They're shooting at 'em.

788
01:12:27,100 --> 01:12:29,200
It's panic fire.
They can't see anything.

789
01:12:29,300 --> 01:12:31,100
They're shooting at the lights.

790
01:12:35,500 --> 01:12:39,000
They're going after the lights.
Call them back.

791
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:41,400
It's not happening.

792
01:12:41,500 --> 01:12:42,700
Mike, burn it.

793
01:12:44,900 --> 01:12:46,600
Don't be impatient.

794
01:12:47,500 --> 01:12:49,300
Just wound them.

795
01:12:51,300 --> 01:12:53,800
Get them back.
They're sitting ducks without lights.

796
01:12:53,900 --> 01:12:55,700
They're almost in.

797
01:12:55,800 --> 01:12:56,900
Send in the car.

798
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:58,600
Send in the car.

799
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:13,400
Jesus Christ!

800
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:19,200
Rivers, Rodriguez, report.

801
01:13:19,400 --> 01:13:22,200
Wait a minute.
What have we here, gentlemen?

802
01:13:26,300 --> 01:13:29,000
The police have themselves an RV.

803
01:13:34,300 --> 01:13:35,600
Southeast corner.

804
01:13:48,700 --> 01:13:50,600
Oh, Jesus Christ.

805
01:14:02,500 --> 01:14:05,200
Get back! Get the fuck back!

806
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:08,100
Get over there.

807
01:14:08,200 --> 01:14:09,600
Schnell! Schnell!

808
01:14:09,700 --> 01:14:11,800
Mach schnell!

809
01:14:14,700 --> 01:14:16,600
Weiter! Weiter! Weiter!

810
01:14:16,700 --> 01:14:18,500
Mach schnell! Mach schnell!

811
01:14:18,600 --> 01:14:19,800
Weiter!

812
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:24,300
Mach los! Mach los!

813
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:45,300
I see him!

814
01:14:56,900 --> 01:14:58,600
- Fire!
- Clear!

815
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:07,600
Oh, my God!
The quarterback is toast!

816
01:15:08,200 --> 01:15:10,800
Hang on, Rivers. That's an order.

817
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:13,000
Hit it again.

818
01:15:13,100 --> 01:15:15,400
All right, you motherfucker,
you made your point!

819
01:15:15,500 --> 01:15:16,300
Let them pull back!

820
01:15:16,400 --> 01:15:18,900
Thank you, Mr Cowboy.
I'll take it under advisement.

821
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:19,400
Hit it

822
01:15:19,500 --> 01:15:20,500
again.

823
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:36,100
Fire.

824
01:15:50,600 --> 01:15:52,600
Fuck me.

825
01:15:52,700 --> 01:15:55,200
Get them out of the car! They're burning!

826
01:16:05,500 --> 01:16:06,100
Fuck it.

827
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:10,600
Mach schnell! Mach los!

828
01:16:18,500 --> 01:16:22,100
Let's see you take this
under advisement, jerkweed.

829
01:16:25,900 --> 01:16:27,800
Geronimo, motherfucker.

830
01:16:46,600 --> 01:16:47,600
Oh, shit!

831
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:54,400
They're using artillery on us!

832
01:16:54,500 --> 01:16:56,600
You idiot, it's not the police.

833
01:16:57,200 --> 01:16:58,900
It's him.

834
01:17:06,400 --> 01:17:07,700
Holy shit.

835
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:14,500
My God!

836
01:17:16,700 --> 01:17:19,600
- Tell me you got that.
- I got it.

837
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,500
Eat your heart out, Channel Five.

838
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:24,900
We've had an update

839
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,500
on the terrorist takeover
of the Nakatomi building.

840
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:29,800
Sources say
the terrorist leader, Hans,

841
01:17:29,800 --> 01:17:31,900
may be this man... Hans Gruber.

842
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,900
A member of the radical
West German Volksfrei movement.

843
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:38,800
Strangely, the Volksfrei leadership
issued a communiqué an hour ago

844
01:17:38,900 --> 01:17:41,700
stating that Gruber had been
expelled from that organization.

845
01:17:41,700 --> 01:17:43,800
Al, do you copy?

846
01:17:44,200 --> 01:17:45,600
Are you all right?

847
01:17:46,500 --> 01:17:47,900
Yeah, I'm fine.

848
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:50,300
W-what was that?

849
01:17:50,500 --> 01:17:53,300
Remember that plastic
explosive I told you about?

850
01:17:53,500 --> 01:17:56,300
There you go.
Is the building on fire?

851
01:17:56,500 --> 01:17:58,200
No, but it's gonna need a paintjob

852
01:17:58,300 --> 01:17:59,900
and a shitload of screen doors.

853
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,800
Our spotter said you got two
with that blast.

854
01:18:02,900 --> 01:18:05,400
- Is that him?
- Yes, sir.

855
01:18:07,100 --> 01:18:09,700
I don't know who you think you are

856
01:18:09,800 --> 01:18:12,300
but you just destroyed a building.

857
01:18:12,300 --> 01:18:15,500
We do not want your help.
Is that clear?

858
01:18:15,500 --> 01:18:17,300
We don't want your help.

859
01:18:17,500 --> 01:18:20,500
I've got 100 people down here,
and they're covered with glass.

860
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:23,500
Glass? Who gives a shit about glass?

861
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:24,600
Who the fuck is this?

862
01:18:26,200 --> 01:18:28,900
This is Deputy Chief of Police
Dwayne T Robinson

863
01:18:28,900 --> 01:18:30,900
and I am in charge of this situation.

864
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:32,800
Oh, you're in charge?

865
01:18:32,900 --> 01:18:34,900
I got some bad news for you, Dwayne.

866
01:18:34,900 --> 01:18:38,200
From up here it doesn't look
like you're in charge of shit.

867
01:18:38,300 --> 01:18:40,400
Listen to me, you little asshole...

868
01:18:40,500 --> 01:18:41,300
Asshole?

869
01:18:41,400 --> 01:18:43,200
I'm not the one
who just got buttfucked

870
01:18:43,300 --> 01:18:45,100
on national TV, Dwayne.

871
01:18:45,200 --> 01:18:46,500
Ah ha ha!

872
01:18:46,600 --> 01:18:48,400
Listen to me, jerk-off,

873
01:18:48,500 --> 01:18:51,500
if you're not part of the solution,
you're part of the problem.

874
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:54,700
Quit being part of the problem
and put the other guy back on!

875
01:18:57,500 --> 01:18:59,200
Hey, Roy, how you feeling?

876
01:18:59,300 --> 01:19:01,300
Pretty fucking unappreciated, Al.

877
01:19:01,400 --> 01:19:03,700
Hey, look. I love you.

878
01:19:03,700 --> 01:19:06,000
So do a lot of the other guys.

879
01:19:06,100 --> 01:19:08,700
So hang in there, man, you hear me?

880
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:10,700
You hang in there.

881
01:19:12,300 --> 01:19:14,800
Yeah, thanks, partner.

882
01:19:20,700 --> 01:19:22,000
What are you doing?

883
01:19:22,100 --> 01:19:23,400
I'm tired of sitting here

884
01:19:23,400 --> 01:19:25,600
waiting to see
who gets us killed first,

885
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:27,100
them or your husband.

886
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:29,200
What are you going to do?

887
01:19:29,200 --> 01:19:30,100
Hey, babe,

888
01:19:30,200 --> 01:19:32,000
I negotiate million-dollar deals
for breakfast.

889
01:19:32,100 --> 01:19:34,000
I think I can handle this Eurotrash.

890
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:37,600
Hey, sprechen sie talk, huh?

891
01:19:37,700 --> 01:19:40,600
If you'd listened to me,
he would be neutralized already.

892
01:19:40,700 --> 01:19:42,400
I don't want neutral. I want dead.

893
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:45,800
Hope I'm not interrupting.

894
01:19:45,800 --> 01:19:46,800
What does he want?

895
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:50,600
It's not what I want.
It's what I can give you.

896
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,400
Look, let's be straight, OK?

897
01:20:00,400 --> 01:20:03,000
It's obvious you're not
some dumb schmuck

898
01:20:03,100 --> 01:20:05,100
up here to snatch a few purses.

899
01:20:05,200 --> 01:20:06,800
You're very perceptive.

900
01:20:06,900 --> 01:20:08,600
I watch 60 Minutes.

901
01:20:08,600 --> 01:20:11,300
I say to myself,
these guys are professional,

902
01:20:11,400 --> 01:20:13,800
they're motivated, they're happening,

903
01:20:13,900 --> 01:20:15,500
they want something.

904
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:18,400
I couldn't care less
about your politics.

905
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:20,700
Maybe you're pissed off
at the camel jockeys.

906
01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:22,300
Maybe it's the Hebes,
Northern Ireland.

907
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:23,800
It's none of my business.

908
01:20:23,800 --> 01:20:26,200
I figure you're here
to negotiate, am I right?

909
01:20:26,200 --> 01:20:27,400
You're amazing.

910
01:20:27,400 --> 01:20:29,800
You figured this all out already?

911
01:20:29,900 --> 01:20:32,000
Hey, business is business.

912
01:20:32,100 --> 01:20:34,000
You use a gun,
I use a fountain pen.

913
01:20:34,100 --> 01:20:35,300
What's the difference?

914
01:20:35,400 --> 01:20:36,500
Let's put it in my terms.

915
01:20:36,600 --> 01:20:38,000
You're here on a hostile takeover.

916
01:20:38,100 --> 01:20:39,300
You grab us for some green

917
01:20:39,400 --> 01:20:42,700
but you didn't expect some poison pill
was gonna be running around the building.

918
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:43,600
Am I right?

919
01:20:44,200 --> 01:20:45,200
Hans,

920
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:46,900
bubbie...

921
01:20:47,400 --> 01:20:49,200
I'm your white knight.

922
01:20:50,300 --> 01:20:53,000
I must have missed 60 Minutes.

923
01:20:53,100 --> 01:20:54,100
What are you saying?

924
01:20:56,500 --> 01:20:59,700
The guy upstairs
who's fucking things up, huh?

925
01:21:04,100 --> 01:21:06,100
I can give him to you.

926
01:21:08,700 --> 01:21:10,800
Oh, God...

927
01:21:12,900 --> 01:21:15,300
Roy? Roy, you all right?

928
01:21:16,500 --> 01:21:19,600
Just trying to fire down
a 1,000-year-old Twinkie.

929
01:21:20,600 --> 01:21:22,100
What do they put in these things,

930
01:21:22,100 --> 01:21:23,000
anyway?

931
01:21:23,500 --> 01:21:25,300
Sugar, enriched flour,

932
01:21:25,400 --> 01:21:27,400
partially hydrogenated
vegetable oil,

933
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:29,000
polysorbate 60,

934
01:21:29,100 --> 01:21:30,800
and yellow dye number five.

935
01:21:30,900 --> 01:21:33,800
Just everything
a growing boy needs.

936
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:36,300
How many kids you got, Al?

937
01:21:36,300 --> 01:21:40,400
As a matter of fact,
my wife is working on our first.

938
01:21:40,500 --> 01:21:42,100
How about you, cowboy?

939
01:21:42,200 --> 01:21:44,700
You got any kids
back on your ranch?

940
01:21:45,900 --> 01:21:47,100
Yeah.

941
01:21:47,700 --> 01:21:48,500
Two.

942
01:21:49,200 --> 01:21:50,900
Sure hope I can see them

943
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,300
swinging on a jungle gym
with Al Jr. someday.

944
01:21:55,800 --> 01:21:57,600
Well, now, that's a date

945
01:21:57,700 --> 01:21:59,800
but you bring the ice cream.

946
01:22:00,300 --> 01:22:02,500
Touching, cowboy. Touching.

947
01:22:03,400 --> 01:22:04,700
Or should I call you

948
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:06,900
Mr McClane?

949
01:22:08,300 --> 01:22:10,900
Mr Officer John McClane

950
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,700
of the New York
Police Department?

951
01:22:15,300 --> 01:22:17,500
Get on the phone to Harry in New York.

952
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:19,900
You better get a hold of somebody
at Dispatch.

953
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:23,400
Sister Theresa called me
Mr McClane in the third grade.

954
01:22:23,500 --> 01:22:26,100
My friends call me John

955
01:22:26,100 --> 01:22:28,900
and you're neither, shithead.

956
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:32,700
I have someone
who wants to talk to you.

957
01:22:32,800 --> 01:22:35,500
A very special friend

958
01:22:35,600 --> 01:22:38,200
who was with you
at the party tonight.

959
01:22:44,200 --> 01:22:46,300
Hey, John boy.

960
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:49,000
Ellis?

961
01:22:49,300 --> 01:22:50,600
Yeah.

962
01:22:50,700 --> 01:22:54,700
Listen, John, they're giving me
a few minutes to talk sense into you.

963
01:22:54,800 --> 01:22:57,800
I know you think you're doing your job
and I can appreciate that

964
01:22:57,900 --> 01:22:59,600
but you're just dragging
this thing out.

965
01:22:59,700 --> 01:23:02,700
Look, no-one gets out of here
until these guys

966
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:04,500
can talk to the LA Police.

967
01:23:04,600 --> 01:23:08,000
That won't happen until you stop
messing up the works. Capisce?

968
01:23:13,500 --> 01:23:15,300
Ellis, what have you told them?

969
01:23:15,400 --> 01:23:19,400
I told them we were old friends
and you were my guest

970
01:23:19,500 --> 01:23:21,000
at the party.

971
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
Ellis, you shouldn't be doing this.

972
01:23:24,100 --> 01:23:25,300
Tell me about it.

973
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:33,700
All right, John, listen.

974
01:23:33,800 --> 01:23:37,000
They want you to tell them
where the detonators are.

975
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,300
They know people are listening.

976
01:23:39,400 --> 01:23:43,300
They want the detonators,
or they're gonna kill me.

977
01:23:46,900 --> 01:23:48,300
John, didn't you hear me?

978
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:52,700
Yeah, I hear you.

979
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:54,600
John, get with the program.

980
01:23:54,700 --> 01:23:57,300
The police are here now.
It's their problem.

981
01:23:57,400 --> 01:23:59,900
Tell these guys where the detonators are
so no-one else gets hurt!

982
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:03,000
I'm putting my life
on the line for you, pal!

983
01:24:03,100 --> 01:24:05,300
Ellis, listen to me carefully.

984
01:24:05,400 --> 01:24:05,800
John...

985
01:24:05,800 --> 01:24:07,800
Shut up, Ellis!
Just shut your mouth!

986
01:24:08,600 --> 01:24:10,000
Put Hans back on the line.

987
01:24:10,100 --> 01:24:14,700
Hans, this shithead doesn't know
what kind of man you are but I do.

988
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:16,800
Good. Then you'll
give us what we want

989
01:24:16,900 --> 01:24:18,200
and save your friend's life.

990
01:24:18,300 --> 01:24:20,500
You're not part of this equation.

991
01:24:20,600 --> 01:24:22,900
Hey, what am I, a method actor?

992
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:24,500
Babe, put away the gun.

993
01:24:24,700 --> 01:24:26,300
This is radio, not television.

994
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:28,500
Hans, this asshole is not my friend!

995
01:24:28,500 --> 01:24:30,000
I just met him tonight!
I don't know him!

996
01:24:30,100 --> 01:24:32,100
Jesus Christ, Ellis!
These people will kill you!

997
01:24:32,200 --> 01:24:34,100
Tell them you don't know me!

998
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:37,700
How can you say that
after all these years?

999
01:24:37,700 --> 01:24:41,300
John? John?

1000
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:06,200
Do you hear that?

1001
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,400
Talk to me!
Where are my detonators?

1002
01:25:09,800 --> 01:25:12,400
Where are they,
or shall I shoot another one?

1003
01:25:12,500 --> 01:25:13,700
Sooner or later

1004
01:25:13,800 --> 01:25:16,400
I might get to someone
you do care about.

1005
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:19,600
Go fuck yourself, Hans.

1006
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:22,900
He just let the guy die.

1007
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:25,000
He just gave him up.
Give me that headset.

1008
01:25:25,100 --> 01:25:27,200
That's like pulling the trigger yourself.

1009
01:25:27,300 --> 01:25:31,000
Can't you see what's happening?
Can't you read between the lines?

1010
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,300
He did everything he could
to save him.

1011
01:25:33,400 --> 01:25:36,500
If he gave himself up,
they'd both be dead right now!

1012
01:25:36,600 --> 01:25:39,300
No way, man. They'd be talking to us.

1013
01:25:39,400 --> 01:25:42,900
You tell this partner of yours
to stay out of this from now on.

1014
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:46,000
Because if he doesn't,
I'm really going to nail his ass.

1015
01:25:46,100 --> 01:25:48,000
The man is hurting.

1016
01:25:48,100 --> 01:25:49,700
He is alone, tired,

1017
01:25:49,800 --> 01:25:53,500
and he hasn't seen diddly-squat
from anybody here!

1018
01:25:53,600 --> 01:25:56,100
You're gonna tell me he'll give a damn

1019
01:25:56,200 --> 01:25:59,300
about what you do to him
if he makes it out of there alive?

1020
01:25:59,400 --> 01:26:02,300
Why don't you wake up
and smell what you're shoveling?

1021
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:04,000
You listen to me, sergeant.

1022
01:26:04,100 --> 01:26:07,600
Any time you want to go home,
you consider yourself dismissed.

1023
01:26:07,700 --> 01:26:11,000
No, sir.
You couldn't drag me away.

1024
01:26:11,100 --> 01:26:13,000
Attention, police.

1025
01:26:14,100 --> 01:26:16,200
Attention, police.

1026
01:26:16,300 --> 01:26:19,400
- This is Sergeant Al Powell...
- Give me that.

1027
01:26:19,700 --> 01:26:22,000
This is Deputy Chief Dwayne Robinson.

1028
01:26:22,100 --> 01:26:23,000
Who is this?

1029
01:26:23,100 --> 01:26:24,600
This is Hans Gruber.

1030
01:26:25,900 --> 01:26:29,400
I assume you realize the futility
of direct action against me.

1031
01:26:29,500 --> 01:26:31,400
We have no wish
for further loss of life.

1032
01:26:31,500 --> 01:26:34,500
What is it you do wish for?

1033
01:26:34,600 --> 01:26:38,900
I have comrades in arms
around the world languishing in prison.

1034
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:42,700
The American State Department
enjoys rattling its saber for its own ends.

1035
01:26:42,700 --> 01:26:44,800
Now it can rattle it for me.

1036
01:26:46,200 --> 01:26:49,900
The following people
are to be released from their captors.

1037
01:26:50,500 --> 01:26:53,600
In Northern Ireland the seven members
of the New Provo Front.

1038
01:26:53,700 --> 01:26:58,300
In Canada, the five imprisoned leaders
of Liberté de Quebec.

1039
01:26:58,400 --> 01:27:02,300
In Sri Lanka, the nine members
of the Asian Dawn.

1040
01:27:02,500 --> 01:27:03,900
What the fuck?

1041
01:27:04,100 --> 01:27:05,900
Asian Dawn?

1042
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,400
I read about them in Time magazine.

1043
01:27:08,500 --> 01:27:12,500
When these revolutionary
brothers and sisters are free,

1044
01:27:12,500 --> 01:27:15,700
the hostages in this building
will be taken to the roof

1045
01:27:15,900 --> 01:27:18,200
and they will accompany us
in helicopters

1046
01:27:18,300 --> 01:27:20,500
to the Los Angeles
International Airport

1047
01:27:20,600 --> 01:27:23,200
where they will be given
further instructions.

1048
01:27:23,300 --> 01:27:25,200
You have two hours to comply.

1049
01:27:25,300 --> 01:27:28,700
Wait a minute. Uh, Mr. Gruber.
This is crazy.

1050
01:27:28,800 --> 01:27:32,500
I don't have the authority.
Two hours is not enough.

1051
01:27:32,600 --> 01:27:35,000
Hello? Hello!

1052
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:40,200
Did you get all that?
We got to make some calls.

1053
01:27:40,300 --> 01:27:42,400
Do you think they'll even try?

1054
01:27:42,500 --> 01:27:44,200
Who cares?

1055
01:27:46,900 --> 01:27:49,100
Theo, are we on schedule?

1056
01:27:49,200 --> 01:27:51,100
One more to go, then it's up to you.

1057
01:27:51,200 --> 01:27:54,600
You better be right
because the last one will take a miracle.

1058
01:27:54,700 --> 01:27:56,200
It's Christmas, Theo.

1059
01:27:56,300 --> 01:27:58,900
It's the time of miracles,
so be of good cheer

1060
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:01,700
and call me
when you hit the last lock.

1061
01:28:02,400 --> 01:28:03,500
Karl,

1062
01:28:03,600 --> 01:28:07,200
hunt that little shit down
and get those detonators.

1063
01:28:07,400 --> 01:28:09,400
Fritz is checking the explosives.

1064
01:28:09,600 --> 01:28:12,200
I'll check the explosives.
You just get the detonators.

1065
01:28:12,300 --> 01:28:14,600
Hey, Powell, you out there?

1066
01:28:14,700 --> 01:28:17,400
I'm here, John. I'm here.

1067
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:21,400
You gotta believe me.
There was nothing I could do.

1068
01:28:21,500 --> 01:28:25,100
Well, it's gonna be
both our asses if you're wrong.

1069
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:27,200
I hear you.

1070
01:28:33,100 --> 01:28:35,500
Did you catch that bullshit
Hans was running?

1071
01:28:35,600 --> 01:28:38,100
It doesn't make sense, man.

1072
01:28:39,500 --> 01:28:40,800
Hey, don't ask me, man.

1073
01:28:40,900 --> 01:28:43,400
I'm just a desk jockey
who was on my way home when you rang.

1074
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:47,200
The way you drove that car
I figured you for the street, Al.

1075
01:28:47,300 --> 01:28:50,200
In my youth. In my youth.

1076
01:28:50,300 --> 01:28:54,300
..author of "Hostage Terrorist,
Terrorist Hostage,

1077
01:28:54,400 --> 01:28:55,500
A Study in Duality."

1078
01:28:55,600 --> 01:28:57,200
Dr Hasseldorf,

1079
01:28:57,200 --> 01:28:59,400
what can we expect
in the next few hours?

1080
01:28:59,400 --> 01:29:00,000
Well, Gail,

1081
01:29:00,100 --> 01:29:02,600
by this time,
the hostages should be going through

1082
01:29:02,700 --> 01:29:05,000
the early stages
of the Helsinki Syndrome.

1083
01:29:05,100 --> 01:29:07,000
As in Helsinki, Sweden.

1084
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:08,600
Finland.

1085
01:29:08,700 --> 01:29:12,300
Basically, it's when the hostages
and the terrorists

1086
01:29:12,400 --> 01:29:15,000
go through a sort of
psychological transference

1087
01:29:15,100 --> 01:29:17,200
and a projection of dependency.

1088
01:29:17,300 --> 01:29:20,200
A strange sort of trust
and bond develops.

1089
01:29:20,300 --> 01:29:22,800
We've had situations
where the hostages

1090
01:29:22,900 --> 01:29:25,300
have embraced their captors
after release

1091
01:29:25,300 --> 01:29:27,700
and even corresponded with them
in prison.

1092
01:29:27,900 --> 01:29:30,700
No, no, darling. Asian Dawn. Dawn.

1093
01:29:30,700 --> 01:29:33,700
D-A-W-N.

1094
01:29:33,800 --> 01:29:35,300
- Sir?
- Yeah?

1095
01:29:35,300 --> 01:29:37,300
Sir, the FBI is here.

1096
01:29:37,300 --> 01:29:41,100
- The FBI is here now?
- Yes, sir. Right over there.

1097
01:29:41,200 --> 01:29:42,300
Hold this.

1098
01:29:42,600 --> 01:29:44,900
Want a breath mint?

1099
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:50,900
Hey, how you doing, man?

1100
01:29:51,400 --> 01:29:54,100
I'm Agent Johnson.
This is Special Agent Johnson.

1101
01:29:54,100 --> 01:29:57,500
- Oh, how you doing?
- No relation.

1102
01:29:57,500 --> 01:29:58,900
I'm, uh...

1103
01:30:00,300 --> 01:30:03,300
I'm Dwayne Robinson, LAPD.
I'm in charge here.

1104
01:30:04,200 --> 01:30:06,300
Not any more.

1105
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:04,500
Hi, there. How you doing?

1106
01:31:07,800 --> 01:31:08,900
Ohh...

1107
01:31:10,500 --> 01:31:13,600
Please, God. No.
You're one of them, aren't you?

1108
01:31:13,700 --> 01:31:15,300
You're one of them.

1109
01:31:15,400 --> 01:31:18,200
No! Don't kill me! Please!

1110
01:31:18,300 --> 01:31:20,800
Don't kill me, please!
Please, please, please.

1111
01:31:20,800 --> 01:31:23,600
Whoa. Relax.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

1112
01:31:23,700 --> 01:31:25,400
I'm not gonna hurt you!

1113
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:29,600
Oh, God.

1114
01:31:33,100 --> 01:31:34,600
What the fuck
are you doing up here?

1115
01:31:34,700 --> 01:31:36,300
What were you looking for?

1116
01:31:36,400 --> 01:31:38,800
I managed to get out of there and

1117
01:31:38,800 --> 01:31:42,000
I was just trying
to get up on the roof

1118
01:31:42,100 --> 01:31:44,800
and see if I could signal for help.

1119
01:31:46,300 --> 01:31:48,400
It's just over here.
Why don't you come and help?

1120
01:31:48,500 --> 01:31:51,600
Hold it. Forget the roof.

1121
01:31:52,300 --> 01:31:55,200
I said forget the roof.
They got people all over it.

1122
01:31:56,600 --> 01:31:59,000
You want to stay alive,
you stay with me.

1123
01:32:01,900 --> 01:32:03,900
The best we can figure it,

1124
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:07,500
we've got maybe
30 or 35 hostages up there

1125
01:32:07,600 --> 01:32:09,500
probably on the 30th floor

1126
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:13,200
and maybe seven or eight
terrorists up there.

1127
01:32:13,300 --> 01:32:15,500
Sounds like an A-7 scenario.

1128
01:32:15,600 --> 01:32:18,000
Thank you.
We'll handle it from here.

1129
01:32:18,100 --> 01:32:20,900
When we commandeer your men,
we'll try and let you know.

1130
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:22,900
Aren't you forgetting something?

1131
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:24,000
Such as?

1132
01:32:24,100 --> 01:32:25,800
What about John McClane?

1133
01:32:25,800 --> 01:32:29,000
He's the reason
we have any information.

1134
01:32:29,100 --> 01:32:32,700
He's also the reason
you're facing seven terrorists, not twelve.

1135
01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:35,100
He's inside? Who is he?

1136
01:32:35,200 --> 01:32:38,100
He might be a cop.
We're checking on that.

1137
01:32:38,200 --> 01:32:40,900
- One of yours?
- No, no way.

1138
01:32:46,400 --> 01:32:47,300
You smoke?

1139
01:32:48,800 --> 01:32:50,300
Yeah.

1140
01:32:55,100 --> 01:32:56,300
Thanks.

1141
01:33:00,100 --> 01:33:03,000
You don't work for Nakatomi.

1142
01:33:07,300 --> 01:33:09,100
And if you're not one of them...

1143
01:33:12,300 --> 01:33:13,700
I'm a cop from New York.

1144
01:33:15,600 --> 01:33:17,200
New York?

1145
01:33:17,300 --> 01:33:18,400
Yeah.

1146
01:33:19,300 --> 01:33:22,100
Got invited to
the Christmas party by mistake.

1147
01:33:22,200 --> 01:33:23,500
Who knew?

1148
01:33:31,300 --> 01:33:33,700
Better than being caught
with your pants down, huh?

1149
01:33:43,500 --> 01:33:44,900
I'm John McClane.

1150
01:33:46,300 --> 01:33:47,800
You're, uh...

1151
01:33:49,200 --> 01:33:50,300
Clay.

1152
01:33:52,800 --> 01:33:54,100
Bill Clay.

1153
01:34:00,300 --> 01:34:02,300
Know how to use a handgun, Bill?

1154
01:34:03,700 --> 01:34:05,700
I spent a weekend at a combat ranch.

1155
01:34:05,800 --> 01:34:08,100
That game with the guns
that shoot red paint.

1156
01:34:08,200 --> 01:34:10,400
Probably seems kind of stupid to you.

1157
01:34:11,800 --> 01:34:13,000
Nope.

1158
01:34:16,200 --> 01:34:18,000
Time for the real thing, Bill.

1159
01:34:26,500 --> 01:34:28,800
All you got to do
is pull the trigger.

1160
01:34:29,500 --> 01:34:30,000
Come on.

1161
01:34:49,500 --> 01:34:51,000
Put down the gun

1162
01:34:51,100 --> 01:34:53,800
and give me my detonators.

1163
01:34:58,200 --> 01:34:59,600
Well, well, well...

1164
01:35:01,600 --> 01:35:02,600
Hans.

1165
01:35:03,700 --> 01:35:06,200
Put it down now.

1166
01:35:09,800 --> 01:35:12,500
That's pretty tricky
with that accent.

1167
01:35:12,600 --> 01:35:15,900
You oughta be on fucking TV
with that accent.

1168
01:35:18,900 --> 01:35:22,500
But what do you want
with the detonators?

1169
01:35:22,600 --> 01:35:25,300
I already used all the explosives.

1170
01:35:27,600 --> 01:35:29,000
Or did I?

1171
01:35:30,400 --> 01:35:32,000
I'm going to count to three.

1172
01:35:32,200 --> 01:35:34,600
Yeah. Like you did with Takagi?

1173
01:35:35,700 --> 01:35:36,400
Oops.

1174
01:35:38,300 --> 01:35:39,600
No bullets.

1175
01:35:39,700 --> 01:35:42,800
What do you think...
I'm fucking stupid, Hans?

1176
01:35:42,800 --> 01:35:43,900
You were saying?

1177
01:36:38,600 --> 01:36:39,100
Karl.

1178
01:36:40,100 --> 01:36:41,300
Schieß dem Fenster.

1179
01:36:48,900 --> 01:36:50,800
Shoot the glass!

1180
01:37:24,100 --> 01:37:25,700
Jesus Christ!

1181
01:37:54,900 --> 01:37:57,800
Smile, Karl.
We're back in business.

1182
01:38:00,500 --> 01:38:03,500
..is the last resort of diplomacy,

1183
01:38:03,600 --> 01:38:06,600
then couldn't we just as well say

1184
01:38:06,800 --> 01:38:09,700
that terrorism has an equal claim
on being that, too?

1185
01:38:10,400 --> 01:38:12,500
Tell me you got something.

1186
01:38:12,600 --> 01:38:16,500
McClane's name, badge number,
employment record, vital statistics,

1187
01:38:16,600 --> 01:38:18,000
and his family's home address

1188
01:38:18,100 --> 01:38:20,100
right here in LA.

1189
01:38:22,500 --> 01:38:23,300
Whoo!

1190
01:38:28,800 --> 01:38:30,000
Go to work.

1191
01:38:30,200 --> 01:38:32,000
Got it.

1192
01:38:44,200 --> 01:38:47,400
God, that man looks really pissed.

1193
01:38:49,800 --> 01:38:51,800
He's still alive.

1194
01:38:52,100 --> 01:38:53,100
What?

1195
01:38:54,500 --> 01:38:58,500
Only John can drive
somebody that crazy.

1196
01:39:13,300 --> 01:39:16,400
Hans, you better heat up that miracle

1197
01:39:16,500 --> 01:39:18,600
because we just broke through
on number six

1198
01:39:18,700 --> 01:39:21,400
and the electromagnetic
came down like a fucking anvil.

1199
01:39:21,500 --> 01:39:26,800
Have a look at what our friends
outside are doing and I'll be right up.

1200
01:39:29,300 --> 01:39:30,400
Hey, John.

1201
01:39:30,500 --> 01:39:32,900
John McClane, you still with us?

1202
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:34,100
Yeah.

1203
01:39:34,900 --> 01:39:38,700
But all things being equal,
I'd rather be in Philadelphia.

1204
01:39:39,300 --> 01:39:41,500
Chalk up two more bad guys.

1205
01:39:41,800 --> 01:39:44,600
The boys down here
will be glad to hear that.

1206
01:39:45,500 --> 01:39:47,300
We got a pool going on you.

1207
01:39:47,500 --> 01:39:49,300
What kind of odds am I getting?

1208
01:39:49,400 --> 01:39:51,000
You don't want to know.

1209
01:39:51,100 --> 01:39:52,600
Put me down for 20.

1210
01:39:52,700 --> 01:39:53,800
I'm good for it.

1211
01:39:57,700 --> 01:40:00,400
Hey, pal, you got flat feet?

1212
01:40:02,900 --> 01:40:05,100
What the hell
are you talking about, man?

1213
01:40:05,200 --> 01:40:07,600
Something had
to get you off the street.

1214
01:40:07,700 --> 01:40:08,900
What's the matter?

1215
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:12,200
You don't think jockeying papers
across a desk is a noble effort for a cop?

1216
01:40:14,100 --> 01:40:15,400
No.

1217
01:40:18,900 --> 01:40:20,900
I had an accident.

1218
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:23,300
The way you drive, I can see why.

1219
01:40:23,400 --> 01:40:24,100
What'd you do ?

1220
01:40:24,200 --> 01:40:26,800
Run over your captain's foot
with the car?

1221
01:40:30,700 --> 01:40:31,900
I shot a kid.

1222
01:40:33,500 --> 01:40:35,300
He was 13 years old.

1223
01:40:36,600 --> 01:40:38,600
Oh, it was dark. I couldn't see him.

1224
01:40:38,700 --> 01:40:40,600
He had a ray gun, looked real enough.

1225
01:40:43,900 --> 01:40:47,600
When you're a rookie, they teach you
everything about being a cop

1226
01:40:47,700 --> 01:40:49,600
except how to live with a mistake.

1227
01:40:53,600 --> 01:40:58,000
Anyway, I just couldn't bring myself
to draw my gun on anybody again.

1228
01:41:01,400 --> 01:41:02,800
Sorry, man.

1229
01:41:04,200 --> 01:41:07,000
Hey, man, how could you know?

1230
01:41:09,300 --> 01:41:11,100
I feel like shit anyway.

1231
01:41:14,100 --> 01:41:15,700
Well, then, this won't matter.

1232
01:41:15,800 --> 01:41:20,600
The LAPD is not calling the shots
down here any more.

1233
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:24,200
The Feds?

1234
01:41:24,700 --> 01:41:25,800
You got it.

1235
01:41:27,400 --> 01:41:29,700
Those are the city engineers.

1236
01:41:30,900 --> 01:41:31,700
Wait.

1237
01:41:32,500 --> 01:41:34,400
They're going into the street circuits.

1238
01:41:34,500 --> 01:41:37,500
Those guys in the suits,
I don't know who they are.

1239
01:41:37,600 --> 01:41:38,500
That's the FBI.

1240
01:41:39,400 --> 01:41:43,000
They're ordering the others
to cut the building's power.

1241
01:41:43,100 --> 01:41:45,100
Regular as clockwork.

1242
01:41:46,900 --> 01:41:48,500
Or a time lock.

1243
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:50,800
Precisely.

1244
01:41:50,800 --> 01:41:54,700
The circuits that cannot be cut
are cut automatically

1245
01:41:54,800 --> 01:41:57,500
in response to a terrorist incident.

1246
01:41:57,600 --> 01:41:59,700
You asked for miracles, Theo.

1247
01:41:59,800 --> 01:42:04,000
I give you the F-B-I.

1248
01:42:04,100 --> 01:42:06,000
I want the building shut down.

1249
01:42:06,100 --> 01:42:08,200
I got a problem. I got a switch...

1250
01:42:08,300 --> 01:42:12,300
I don't care
about your switch. I want it out. Dark!

1251
01:42:13,300 --> 01:42:14,800
You can't do it from here.

1252
01:42:14,900 --> 01:42:17,300
- Yeah, you could.
- It can't be done from here.

1253
01:42:17,400 --> 01:42:19,100
I could just... I got the radio...

1254
01:42:19,200 --> 01:42:22,700
You can't do it from here.
It's got to be done from downtown.

1255
01:42:22,800 --> 01:42:24,600
They've gotta take out
a whole city grid.

1256
01:42:24,600 --> 01:42:26,600
We're talking 10 square blocks.

1257
01:42:26,700 --> 01:42:28,500
Ten blocks? Johnson, that's crazy.

1258
01:42:28,600 --> 01:42:31,200
It's Christmas Eve.
There's thousands of people.

1259
01:42:31,200 --> 01:42:32,900
You have to go wider.

1260
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:38,100
- I need authorization.
- How about the United States government?

1261
01:42:38,200 --> 01:42:40,200
Lose the grid, or you lose your job.

1262
01:42:46,500 --> 01:42:48,200
- Yeah, Central?
- Yeah?

1263
01:42:48,300 --> 01:42:50,700
This is Walt down at Nakatomi.

1264
01:42:50,700 --> 01:42:55,700
Would it be possible for you
to turn off grid 212?

1265
01:42:55,700 --> 01:42:56,900
Are you crazy?!

1266
01:42:56,900 --> 01:42:59,600
Maybe I should call the Mayor.

1267
01:42:59,700 --> 01:43:02,800
No shit it's my ass.
I got a big problem here.

1268
01:43:02,900 --> 01:43:05,200
Shut it down now.

1269
01:43:08,600 --> 01:43:10,800
Emergency lighting activated.

1270
01:43:11,400 --> 01:43:14,200
Al, talk to me. What's going on here?

1271
01:43:14,300 --> 01:43:15,900
Ask the FBI.

1272
01:43:15,900 --> 01:43:18,700
They got the universal
terrorist playbook

1273
01:43:18,800 --> 01:43:21,200
and they're running it step by step.

1274
01:43:23,300 --> 01:43:25,200
It's gonna go. It's gonna go!

1275
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:28,500
Yes!

1276
01:43:51,300 --> 01:43:52,800
Merry Christmas.

1277
01:43:54,300 --> 01:43:57,500
They must be pissing in their pants.

1278
01:43:57,600 --> 01:43:59,500
The Mayor is gonna have my ass.

1279
01:44:06,500 --> 01:44:07,800
Whoo!

1280
01:44:20,800 --> 01:44:23,000
What are we gonna do now ?

1281
01:44:23,100 --> 01:44:26,100
Arrest them for not paying
their electric bill?

1282
01:44:26,200 --> 01:44:28,000
We've shut them down.

1283
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:31,500
We let them sweat for a while,
then we give them helicopters.

1284
01:44:31,600 --> 01:44:33,800
Right up the ass.

1285
01:44:36,300 --> 01:44:37,900
This is Agent Johnson.

1286
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:39,300
No, the other one.

1287
01:44:39,400 --> 01:44:42,700
I want that air support ready
to lift off in five minutes.

1288
01:44:42,800 --> 01:44:46,300
Damn right. Fully armed.
We're on the way.

1289
01:44:52,200 --> 01:44:54,100
Oh, yes!

1290
01:44:55,800 --> 01:44:58,200
I wish to talk to the FBI.

1291
01:45:00,800 --> 01:45:03,000
This is Special Agent Johnson.

1292
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:07,500
The State Department has arranged
for the return of your comrades.

1293
01:45:07,600 --> 01:45:10,200
Helicopters are en route
as you requested.

1294
01:45:10,300 --> 01:45:11,600
I hear you. We'll be ready.

1295
01:45:11,700 --> 01:45:15,000
By the time he figures out
what hit him, he'll be in a body bag.

1296
01:45:15,100 --> 01:45:17,000
When they touch down,
we'll blow the roof.

1297
01:45:17,100 --> 01:45:18,800
They'll spend a month
sifting through the rubble.

1298
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:21,900
By the time they figure out
what went wrong,

1299
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:25,000
we'll be sitting on a beach earning 20%.

1300
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:31,500
Ah! Jeez!

1301
01:45:31,600 --> 01:45:32,600
Powell?

1302
01:45:33,500 --> 01:45:35,300
Yo, Powell, you got a minute?

1303
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:38,800
I'm here, John.

1304
01:45:40,500 --> 01:45:43,500
Listen, I'm starting to get
a bad feeling up here.

1305
01:45:44,100 --> 01:45:46,000
I want you to do something for me.

1306
01:45:46,100 --> 01:45:47,400
Um... ahem...

1307
01:45:48,900 --> 01:45:50,400
I want you to find my wife.

1308
01:45:50,500 --> 01:45:52,800
Don't ask me how.
By then you'll know how.

1309
01:45:52,900 --> 01:45:56,300
Uh, I want you
to tell her something.

1310
01:45:57,900 --> 01:45:59,600
I want you to tell her that...

1311
01:46:06,500 --> 01:46:09,200
Tell her it took me
a while to figure out

1312
01:46:09,300 --> 01:46:11,200
what a jerk I've been

1313
01:46:11,900 --> 01:46:13,200
but, um...

1314
01:46:14,900 --> 01:46:15,900
that...

1315
01:46:19,700 --> 01:46:22,400
that when things started
to pan out for her

1316
01:46:22,500 --> 01:46:26,600
I should have been more supportive.

1317
01:46:27,100 --> 01:46:27,900
And, uh...

1318
01:46:29,400 --> 01:46:32,300
I just should have been
behind her more.

1319
01:46:35,100 --> 01:46:36,400
Oh, shit.

1320
01:46:39,100 --> 01:46:41,100
Tell her that, um

1321
01:46:42,100 --> 01:46:46,700
that she's the best thing
that ever happened to a bum like me.

1322
01:46:48,600 --> 01:46:52,000
She's heard me say "I love you"
a thousand times.

1323
01:46:53,200 --> 01:46:56,600
She never heard me say I'm sorry.

1324
01:46:57,200 --> 01:47:03,400
I want you to tell her that, Al.
Tell her that John said that he was sorry.

1325
01:47:04,900 --> 01:47:05,900
OK?

1326
01:47:06,900 --> 01:47:08,000
You got that, man?

1327
01:47:08,100 --> 01:47:10,400
Yeah, I got it, John.

1328
01:47:11,700 --> 01:47:13,400
But you can tell her that yourself.

1329
01:47:13,500 --> 01:47:18,000
You just watch your ass
and you'll make it out. You hear me?

1330
01:47:18,500 --> 01:47:21,100
I guess that's up to the man upstairs.

1331
01:47:24,500 --> 01:47:26,000
John?

1332
01:47:26,900 --> 01:47:28,300
John?

1333
01:47:28,800 --> 01:47:32,300
What the fuck
were you doing upstairs, Hans?

1334
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:35,000
John?

1335
01:47:35,100 --> 01:47:38,200
No, Al, listen.
Just lay off for a while.

1336
01:47:40,200 --> 01:47:43,000
I gotta go check on something.

1337
01:47:45,600 --> 01:47:48,200
One minute, that's all I'm asking.

1338
01:47:48,300 --> 01:47:50,200
One minute to speak to them.

1339
01:47:50,300 --> 01:47:52,300
All right. Get back. Get back.

1340
01:47:52,400 --> 01:47:54,800
All right, look.

1341
01:47:54,900 --> 01:47:59,000
You let me in right now,
or I call the INS, comprende?

1342
01:48:01,600 --> 01:48:04,000
This is the last time
these kids are gonna have

1343
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:06,200
to speak to their parents.

1344
01:48:07,900 --> 01:48:09,000
All right?

1345
01:48:09,300 --> 01:48:11,300
All right. Come on. Come on.

1346
01:48:21,500 --> 01:48:22,900
What were you doing, Hans?

1347
01:48:23,700 --> 01:48:25,200
What were you doing?

1348
01:48:47,600 --> 01:48:50,800
Jesus, Mary, mother of God.

1349
01:48:54,200 --> 01:48:56,800
Al, listen to me!
It's a double-cross!

1350
01:48:56,900 --> 01:48:58,500
The roof is wired to...

1351
01:49:01,200 --> 01:49:02,300
John?

1352
01:49:04,700 --> 01:49:06,200
John!

1353
01:49:06,500 --> 01:49:07,900
John, come in!

1354
01:49:08,400 --> 01:49:09,400
Did you get that?

1355
01:49:09,500 --> 01:49:12,500
Something about a double-cross.

1356
01:49:12,700 --> 01:49:15,000
Tell me about it.

1357
01:49:20,700 --> 01:49:22,900
We are both professionals.

1358
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:26,700
This is personal.

1359
01:49:28,100 --> 01:49:29,400
Aww...

1360
01:49:50,300 --> 01:49:52,700
They're coming!

1361
01:49:53,300 --> 01:49:54,900
Choppers are coming.

1362
01:49:55,200 --> 01:49:58,500
Time to gather your flock,
Miss Gennero.

1363
01:49:58,700 --> 01:50:02,700
Your mom and dad
are very important people.

1364
01:50:02,800 --> 01:50:04,800
They're very brave people.

1365
01:50:04,900 --> 01:50:08,900
Is there something you'd like
to say to them, if they're watching?

1366
01:50:08,900 --> 01:50:12,100
Come home.

1367
01:50:20,600 --> 01:50:21,900
Mrs McClane.

1368
01:50:25,200 --> 01:50:28,500
How nice to make your acquaintance.

1369
01:50:31,700 --> 01:50:33,700
On your feet, everyone! To the roof!

1370
01:50:33,800 --> 01:50:36,500
Lock them up there
and come right back.

1371
01:51:03,400 --> 01:51:06,400
You should have heard
your brother squeal

1372
01:51:06,500 --> 01:51:09,700
when I broke his fucking neck!

1373
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:15,300
What do you figure the breakage?

1374
01:51:15,400 --> 01:51:17,600
I figure we take out the terrorists,

1375
01:51:17,700 --> 01:51:20,600
lose 20, 25% of the hostages, tops.

1376
01:51:21,400 --> 01:51:23,800
I can live with that.

1377
01:51:23,900 --> 01:51:25,300
Get this thing on the deck.

1378
01:51:25,400 --> 01:51:28,800
They're expecting transports,
not gun ships.

1379
01:51:40,900 --> 01:51:42,700
Move it! Come on! Move!

1380
01:51:42,800 --> 01:51:44,400
Come on! Come on!

1381
01:51:44,400 --> 01:51:45,700
Move it!

1382
01:51:46,900 --> 01:51:48,200
Go! Move!

1383
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:53,000
Theo.

1384
01:51:53,500 --> 01:51:55,100
A little bonus for us.

1385
01:51:55,200 --> 01:51:57,200
Please, sit down. Sit down!

1386
01:51:57,300 --> 01:52:00,000
A policeman's wife
might come in handy.

1387
01:52:00,100 --> 01:52:02,600
McClane, I have some news for you.

1388
01:52:03,600 --> 01:52:05,000
McClane?

1389
01:52:16,400 --> 01:52:17,700
Move!

1390
01:52:20,400 --> 01:52:21,100
Come on!

1391
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:36,200
Motherfucker! I'll kill you!

1392
01:52:40,200 --> 01:52:41,200
Armed.

1393
01:52:41,700 --> 01:52:43,800
- The truck?
- The truck.

1394
01:52:50,900 --> 01:52:55,000
After all your posturing,
all your little speeches,

1395
01:52:55,100 --> 01:52:57,400
you're nothing but a common thief.

1396
01:52:57,600 --> 01:53:00,100
I am an exceptional thief,
Mrs McClane.

1397
01:53:00,200 --> 01:53:01,800
And since I'm moving up
to kidnapping,

1398
01:53:01,900 --> 01:53:03,900
you should be more polite.

1399
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:13,100
You motherfucker,
I'm gonna kill you!

1400
01:53:13,200 --> 01:53:16,600
I'm gonna fuckin' cook you,
and I'm gonna fuckin' eat you!

1401
01:53:39,200 --> 01:53:41,300
I don't like this, Sarge.

1402
01:53:49,100 --> 01:53:55,000
Yee-hah!
Just like fucking Saigon, eh, Slick?

1403
01:53:56,500 --> 01:53:59,400
I was in Junior High, dickhead.

1404
01:54:27,300 --> 01:54:28,700
Where's Holly?

1405
01:54:28,800 --> 01:54:30,300
Where's Holly Gennero?

1406
01:54:30,400 --> 01:54:32,500
Holly Gennero? Where's Holly?

1407
01:54:32,600 --> 01:54:34,400
Where's Holly? Where is she?

1408
01:54:34,500 --> 01:54:36,000
- They took her!
- Where?

1409
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:37,200
The vault!

1410
01:54:37,300 --> 01:54:39,200
- Where is the vault?
- The 30th floor!

1411
01:54:39,300 --> 01:54:41,200
They just took her!

1412
01:54:41,400 --> 01:54:42,600
Get downstairs!

1413
01:54:42,600 --> 01:54:45,200
The whole fucking roof
is wired to blow!

1414
01:54:45,200 --> 01:54:46,800
Get down!

1415
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:49,500
Get down!
Get the fuck downstairs!

1416
01:54:51,700 --> 01:54:54,600
They made us, Bureau.
Terrorist shooting hostages.

1417
01:54:54,700 --> 01:54:56,400
Break left!

1418
01:55:02,600 --> 01:55:04,300
Nail that sucker!

1419
01:55:12,400 --> 01:55:15,500
I'm on your side, you assholes!

1420
01:55:15,600 --> 01:55:18,700
Swing around again!
I'll bag this little bastard.

1421
01:55:37,600 --> 01:55:39,400
What the fuck...

1422
01:55:41,400 --> 01:55:44,300
Oh, John,
what the fuck are you doing?

1423
01:55:44,400 --> 01:55:47,200
How the fuck
did you get into this shit?

1424
01:55:57,300 --> 01:56:00,700
There's something wrong!
They're coming back down!

1425
01:56:00,700 --> 01:56:02,900
- Blow the roof.
- But Karl's up there!

1426
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:04,400
Blow the roof!

1427
01:56:07,700 --> 01:56:10,500
I promise I will never even think

1428
01:56:10,600 --> 01:56:13,600
about going up
in a tall building again.

1429
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:19,300
Oh, God, please don't let me die!

1430
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:53,400
Holy Christ!

1431
01:57:54,600 --> 01:57:57,200
We're gonna need
some more FBI guys, I guess.

1432
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:11,800
Jesus fucking Christ!

1433
01:58:12,800 --> 01:58:13,900
Fuck!

1434
01:58:38,300 --> 01:58:40,800
What the fuck is going on?

1435
01:58:42,700 --> 01:58:46,300
What are you gonna do?
Sit here while the building falls down?

1436
01:58:54,600 --> 01:58:55,500
Shit!

1437
01:58:55,600 --> 01:58:57,500
All right!

1438
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:00,200
Hey! Hey!

1439
01:59:01,100 --> 01:59:02,900
Hang on, baby.

1440
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:04,600
Hang on, honey.

1441
01:59:05,600 --> 01:59:06,600
Oh, God.

1442
01:59:51,800 --> 01:59:53,500
Hans!

1443
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:09,700
Jesus.

1444
02:00:09,800 --> 02:00:13,100
Hi, honey.

1445
02:00:34,200 --> 02:00:38,100
So that's what this is all about?
A fucking robbery?

1446
02:00:38,600 --> 02:00:39,800
Put down the gun.

1447
02:00:41,500 --> 02:00:43,800
Why'd you have to nuke
the whole building, Hans?

1448
02:00:43,900 --> 02:00:46,900
Well, when you steal $600,
you can just disappear.

1449
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:50,000
When you steal 600 million,
they will find you

1450
02:00:50,100 --> 02:00:52,400
unless they think
you're already dead.

1451
02:00:52,500 --> 02:00:54,600
Put down the gun.

1452
02:01:05,100 --> 02:01:06,700
Nein. This is mine.

1453
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:11,800
You got me.

1454
02:01:11,900 --> 02:01:14,700
Still the cowboy, Mr McClane.

1455
02:01:14,800 --> 02:01:16,400
Americans... all alike.

1456
02:01:16,500 --> 02:01:20,500
This time, John Wayne does not walk off
into the sunset with Grace Kelly.

1457
02:01:20,600 --> 02:01:22,400
That was Gary Cooper, asshole.

1458
02:01:22,500 --> 02:01:24,300
Enough jokes.

1459
02:01:24,400 --> 02:01:27,200
You'd have made a pretty
good cowboy yourself, Hans.

1460
02:01:27,400 --> 02:01:32,000
Oh, yes. What was it
you said to me before?

1461
02:01:32,100 --> 02:01:35,800
Yippee-ki-yay, motherfucker.

1462
02:01:57,000 --> 02:01:57,400
Holly!

1463
02:02:03,600 --> 02:02:05,100
Happy trails, Hans.

1464
02:02:10,600 --> 02:02:12,200
- Aah!
- Holly.

1465
02:02:49,700 --> 02:02:51,600
I hope that's not a hostage.

1466
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:24,000
Gimme water hook-ups
for engine companies 5, 3, 9, 6.

1467
02:03:27,700 --> 02:03:29,300
Over here. It's a better angle.

1468
02:03:29,400 --> 02:03:31,300
Let's give them a hand.

1469
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:37,000
Keep it going, now. Keep it going.

1470
02:03:42,100 --> 02:03:45,700
- Come on. We're going to miss it!
- OK. Hand me my notes!

1471
02:04:08,700 --> 02:04:12,800
What was it like in there?
How did they treat you?

1472
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:00,800
Al, this is my wife Holly.

1473
02:05:00,900 --> 02:05:02,800
Holly Gennero.

1474
02:05:03,600 --> 02:05:05,300
Holly McClane.

1475
02:05:05,400 --> 02:05:07,000
Hello, Holly.

1476
02:05:07,200 --> 02:05:09,100
You got yourself a good man.

1477
02:05:09,200 --> 02:05:11,200
You take good care of him.

1478
02:05:11,800 --> 02:05:13,400
McClane!

1479
02:05:13,400 --> 02:05:16,200
McClane, I want a debriefing!

1480
02:05:16,200 --> 02:05:18,900
You got some things
to answer for, mister.

1481
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:20,700
Ellis' murder, for one thing.

1482
02:05:20,800 --> 02:05:24,600
Property damage,
interfering with police business.

1483
02:06:04,900 --> 02:06:08,000
Two of you go inside
and see if there's anybody else!

1484
02:06:18,800 --> 02:06:21,400
No. This one's with me.

1485
02:06:31,300 --> 02:06:32,900
Mr McClane, Mr McClane!

1486
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:35,500
Now that it's all over,
after this incredible ordeal,

1487
02:06:35,700 --> 02:06:37,600
what are your feelings?

1488
02:06:42,900 --> 02:06:44,300
Well, well, well.

1489
02:06:44,400 --> 02:06:48,600
- Merry Christmas, Argyle.
- Merry Christmas.

1490
02:06:52,100 --> 02:06:53,200
Did you get that?

1491
02:06:53,300 --> 02:06:55,300
Let me through.

1492
02:06:55,800 --> 02:06:59,300
If this is their idea of Christmas,
I gotta be here for New Year's.
