1
00:01:43,157 --> 00:01:45,459
Morning, Mr. Thrombey.

2
00:01:58,828 --> 00:02:01,405
Mr. Thrombey, you up there?

3
00:02:01,792 --> 00:02:04,082
Mr. Thrombey, I'm coming in.

4
00:02:14,794 --> 00:02:16,156
Shit!

5
00:02:36,888 --> 00:02:40,228
<i>You killed him! You bastard!
You murdered him!</i>

6
00:02:40,228 --> 00:02:41,702
<i>I didn't murder nobody.</i>

7
00:02:41,702 --> 00:02:45,545
<i>You slashed his face open and you left him
bleeding in the street, like a stuffed pig.</i>

8
00:02:45,545 --> 00:02:50,223
<i>Then you crushed his skull with a forklift
and burnt his hands off to erase the fingerprints.</i>

9
00:02:50,223 --> 00:02:51,347
<i>You'll never prove it.</i>

10
00:02:51,347 --> 00:02:53,530
<i>We have the nanny cam footage!</i>

11
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:55,643
Alice, turn that off now, please.

12
00:02:55,643 --> 00:02:56,711
Why? It's almost over.

13
00:02:56,711 --> 00:02:57,850
Now, please. Just turn that off.

14
00:02:57,850 --> 00:02:59,842
They're finding out who did it,
and the WiFi sucks in my room...

15
00:02:59,842 --> 00:03:02,743
Turn it off now! Alice! Off!

16
00:03:02,743 --> 00:03:05,049
There isn't even anything bad on it,
it's just normal TV...

17
00:03:05,049 --> 00:03:07,364
They're talking murder on it!

18
00:03:07,364 --> 00:03:10,943
Your sister just had a friend
she loves slit his throat open,

19
00:03:10,943 --> 00:03:12,955
and she doesn't need
to be hearing that right now!

20
00:03:12,955 --> 00:03:14,919
Let's be sensitive!

21
00:03:19,029 --> 00:03:21,062
Alice, you can keep watching
your show, it's fine.

22
00:03:21,062 --> 00:03:23,006
No, I guessed who did it anyway.

23
00:03:23,006 --> 00:03:25,701
- I'm sorry Marta.
- It's okay.

24
00:03:27,447 --> 00:03:29,211
It's Harlan's son.

25
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:33,422
Hi, Walt.

26
00:03:33,422 --> 00:03:35,280
Hi, Martha. It's Walt.

27
00:03:35,454 --> 00:03:37,260
Would you mind
coming to the house early?

28
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:40,549
The police have
a few more questions for everybody.

29
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:42,456
What?

30
00:04:01,734 --> 00:04:04,974
Hey! Excuse me ma'am.
You with the help?

31
00:04:04,974 --> 00:04:07,665
Hey! Her name is Marta.
She was granddad's nurse.

32
00:04:07,665 --> 00:04:10,061
She's with us. "The help?"

33
00:04:10,634 --> 00:04:12,481
It's okay. I'm sorry.

34
00:04:12,545 --> 00:04:15,159
No. It's not okay.
What the hell?

35
00:04:24,693 --> 00:04:26,220
How are you doing?

36
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:30,586
Not very good. Alone.

37
00:04:31,282 --> 00:04:35,487
Lots of days,
and not knowing what to do next.

38
00:04:35,836 --> 00:04:38,812
Martha, anything you need.

39
00:04:39,574 --> 00:04:41,607
You're part of this family.

40
00:04:43,104 --> 00:04:44,112
Thank you.

41
00:04:45,956 --> 00:04:48,302
- How are you doing kiddo?
- Linda.

42
00:04:49,072 --> 00:04:50,578
How are you?

43
00:04:52,384 --> 00:04:55,927
You know, the funeral helped, I guess.
Just seeing him.

44
00:04:56,227 --> 00:04:59,022
I thought you should've been there.
I was out voted.

45
00:04:59,022 --> 00:05:01,121
Get arrested.
Die up your own ass for all I care!

46
00:05:01,121 --> 00:05:02,765
Richard.

47
00:05:03,085 --> 00:05:04,597
He's not coming.

48
00:05:05,367 --> 00:05:08,611
Ransom. Little shit.
Missed the funeral.

49
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:10,389
Excuse me.

50
00:05:10,824 --> 00:05:13,540
We're ready for you now.
We'd like to see you one at a time.

51
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:15,775
All right. I'll go first.

52
00:05:15,775 --> 00:05:19,963
I'm assuming this will all be wrapped up
before the memorial tonight.

53
00:05:20,243 --> 00:05:21,973
We'll do our best, ma'am.

54
00:05:24,309 --> 00:05:27,211
So, how are you doing kiddo?

55
00:05:28,543 --> 00:05:31,115
We're just gonna reintroduce
ourselves as a formality.

56
00:05:31,115 --> 00:05:34,610
I am Detective Lieutenant Elliott,
and this is Trooper Wagner.

57
00:05:34,761 --> 00:05:39,844
Now, I'm going to record,
this just to make things easier.

58
00:05:40,127 --> 00:05:42,378
All right, we're with Linda Drysdale,
nee Thrombey,

59
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:44,754
Harlan Thrombey's eldest daughter,

60
00:05:45,723 --> 00:05:48,113
in discussing the events
that took place the night of his demise,

61
00:05:48,113 --> 00:05:50,502
one week ago, November 8th.

62
00:05:50,502 --> 00:05:52,728
We're very sorry for your loss.

63
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:56,473
Thank you. That means a lot.

64
00:05:56,679 --> 00:05:59,800
So, we understand at that night
the family had gathered

65
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,930
to celebrate
your father's 85th birthday.

66
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:03,182
Yes.

67
00:06:03,182 --> 00:06:04,394
How was it?

68
00:06:04,785 --> 00:06:07,288
The party? Pre my dad's death?

69
00:06:08,104 --> 00:06:09,619
It was great.

70
00:06:10,076 --> 00:06:12,561
Did anyone besides the family
show face?

71
00:06:13,196 --> 00:06:14,935
Fran, the housekeeper.

72
00:06:14,935 --> 00:06:18,267
He was a nice guy,
but he was so hairy.

73
00:06:18,267 --> 00:06:21,098
And I dated Italian guys,
you know what I mean.

74
00:06:22,017 --> 00:06:26,306
Marta, Harlan's caregiver,
good girl, hard worker.

75
00:06:26,596 --> 00:06:28,486
Family's from Ecuador.

76
00:06:28,946 --> 00:06:32,840
And Wanetta - Greatnana,
Harlan's mom.

77
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:33,875
Hi Nana.

78
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:37,144
His mom? How old is she?

79
00:06:37,768 --> 00:06:39,219
We have no idea.

80
00:06:39,523 --> 00:06:42,988
Okay, and your son Ransom,
did he attend as well?

81
00:06:43,112 --> 00:06:44,874
Yes, but he left early.

82
00:06:45,548 --> 00:06:48,741
Ransom, are you leaving?

83
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:58,638
Right, would you say that all three of you
showed up around the same time?

84
00:06:59,711 --> 00:07:01,077
No.

85
00:07:02,731 --> 00:07:06,173
Richard came early
to help the caterers set up.

86
00:07:06,373 --> 00:07:10,294
Okay, and you and your husband Richard
work at a real estate firm in Boston?

87
00:07:10,294 --> 00:07:12,188
No, it's my company.

88
00:07:12,188 --> 00:07:13,742
Right, right. Sorry.

89
00:07:13,742 --> 00:07:15,724
I built my business
from the ground up.

90
00:07:16,034 --> 00:07:18,958
Just like your father.
You two were very close?

91
00:07:20,456 --> 00:07:23,669
We had our own secret way
of communicating.

92
00:07:23,794 --> 00:07:26,647
You had to find that with dad.

93
00:07:26,818 --> 00:07:28,693
You had to find a game
to play with him.

94
00:07:28,841 --> 00:07:32,703
And if you did that,
and you played by his rules...

95
00:07:38,122 --> 00:07:40,852
Everyone idolizes their dad, right?

96
00:07:40,974 --> 00:07:42,745
I don't know, do they?

97
00:07:43,789 --> 00:07:47,098
Very much not,
don't know why I said that.

98
00:07:47,871 --> 00:07:49,804
But my wife, Linda, does.

99
00:07:49,804 --> 00:07:52,212
Harlan started out
with a rusty Smith-Corona,

100
00:07:52,212 --> 00:07:56,614
and built himself into one of the bestselling
mystery writers of all time.

101
00:07:56,614 --> 00:08:01,003
Wow, seems like all his kids
are self-made overachievers.

102
00:08:02,812 --> 00:08:04,287
Sure.

103
00:08:04,436 --> 00:08:08,983
For the record, I'm speaking with Walt Thrombey,
Harlan Thrombey's youngest son.

104
00:08:08,983 --> 00:08:11,481
So, you run
your father's publishing company?

105
00:08:11,481 --> 00:08:12,331
Yeah.

106
00:08:12,331 --> 00:08:14,168
It's my - it's our...

107
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:17,564
It's the family's publishing company,
dad trusts me to run it.

108
00:08:18,561 --> 00:08:23,819
30 languages, over 80 million
copies sold. A real legacy.

109
00:08:24,654 --> 00:08:25,745
You guys fans?

110
00:08:25,745 --> 00:08:28,116
I mean, I don't do
much fiction reading myself.

111
00:08:28,116 --> 00:08:30,622
Big fan. I'm big fan.
I mean...

112
00:08:30,622 --> 00:08:33,201
His plots are just like...
I got one spoiler for you,

113
00:08:33,201 --> 00:08:36,673
But, okay, like "A Thousand Knives",
the cow and the shotgun,

114
00:08:36,673 --> 00:08:39,096
like, where do you
come up with that?

115
00:08:39,316 --> 00:08:42,585
Dad said the plots just popped into
his head fully formed.

116
00:08:42,585 --> 00:08:44,476
It was the easy part for him.

117
00:08:46,863 --> 00:08:48,489
So, you're in the area, right?

118
00:08:48,489 --> 00:08:51,034
You guys probably arrived
around the same time?

119
00:08:52,863 --> 00:08:54,723
We all got here around 8.

120
00:08:55,191 --> 00:08:57,369
My wife Donna, she's my rock.

121
00:08:59,301 --> 00:09:01,451
Jesus! Donna. Are you all right?

122
00:09:01,911 --> 00:09:07,450
My son Jacob, he's 16.
Very politically active.

123
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:09,150
The boy is literally a Nazi.

124
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:11,239
He's an alt-right troll dipshit.

125
00:09:11,556 --> 00:09:14,076
Kids today, with the internet.
It's amazing.

126
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:16,649
So, the night went well?

127
00:09:18,701 --> 00:09:22,768
I mean, we're all gutted, but I was happy
to have that night with him.

128
00:09:22,768 --> 00:09:27,464
To be by his side, to think about our books
and what we've accomplished with them.

129
00:09:27,956 --> 00:09:30,925
It's like I can still feel
his hand on my shoulder.

130
00:09:32,317 --> 00:09:33,947
Passing the torch.

131
00:09:33,947 --> 00:09:38,582
So, we're here with Joni Thrombey,
Harlan Thrombey's daughter in law?

132
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:43,131
Yeah, I married his son Neil.
We had one daughter, Meg.

133
00:09:43,409 --> 00:09:47,022
And then Neil passed on,
15 years ago.

134
00:09:47,282 --> 00:09:49,371
And you remained close
to the Thrombeys.

135
00:09:49,371 --> 00:09:51,497
Oh, they're my family.

136
00:09:54,921 --> 00:09:57,381
I feel simultaneously freed by

137
00:09:58,796 --> 00:10:01,240
and supported by them.

138
00:10:04,848 --> 00:10:08,000
It's that balance of opposites
that's the nugget of Flam.

139
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,217
Sorry, the Nugget of...?

140
00:10:10,217 --> 00:10:11,523
Flam.

141
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:14,674
Yeah, Flam, your skin care
company. Sorry.

142
00:10:14,841 --> 00:10:16,410
I forgive you.

143
00:10:16,887 --> 00:10:19,971
Yeah, it's skin care,
but it promotes a total lifestyle.

144
00:10:19,971 --> 00:10:23,879
Self sufficiency with an acknowledgment
of human need.

145
00:10:23,879 --> 00:10:26,903
That's Flam, but it's also Harlan.

146
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:29,427
He got me and Meg
through some tough times.

147
00:10:29,687 --> 00:10:31,354
Granddad gives my mom
a yearly allowance,

148
00:10:31,354 --> 00:10:34,954
and he's never missed
wiring a tuition payment to my schools.

149
00:10:36,573 --> 00:10:39,239
He's a genuinely selfless man.

150
00:10:39,813 --> 00:10:41,791
But, you left his party early?

151
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:42,729
Have fun.

152
00:10:42,729 --> 00:10:44,157
To see some friends at Smith.

153
00:10:44,157 --> 00:10:47,873
You know, Dad pays
for her crypto-Marxist

154
00:10:47,873 --> 00:10:52,469
postdeconstructual feminist
poetry theory whatever major.

155
00:10:53,159 --> 00:10:55,249
She could've stuck around
for the cake.

156
00:10:55,345 --> 00:10:57,395
I think Linda was upset.

157
00:11:00,809 --> 00:11:02,667
But Harlan understood.

158
00:11:06,768 --> 00:11:07,930
Right.

159
00:11:08,448 --> 00:11:11,483
You two showed up to the party
around the same time?

160
00:11:11,483 --> 00:11:14,773
If I could pause.
Because I just...

161
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:18,702
Who is that guy?
And why are we doing all this? Again?

162
00:11:18,702 --> 00:11:20,385
This is just follow up questions,

163
00:11:20,585 --> 00:11:23,698
We're tending to be thorough,
so we can figure out the manner of death.

164
00:11:24,038 --> 00:11:26,645
So by "manner of death"
you mean if someone killed him?

165
00:11:26,645 --> 00:11:29,673
If one of us killed him.
One of his family.

166
00:11:29,673 --> 00:11:30,924
- No, Walt.
- killed him.

167
00:11:30,924 --> 00:11:32,671
Is that what
you're suggesting, Lieutenant?

168
00:11:32,671 --> 00:11:35,377
No one is saying that, okay?
This is all pro forma.

169
00:11:35,792 --> 00:11:36,920
Okay.

170
00:11:37,742 --> 00:11:39,453
So, who the fuck is that?

171
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:43,119
This is Benoit Blanc.

172
00:11:43,687 --> 00:11:45,422
Benoit Blanc?

173
00:11:45,422 --> 00:11:49,584
Yes. Mr. Blanc is a private investigator
of great renown.

174
00:11:49,584 --> 00:11:50,713
Wait a minute.

175
00:11:50,889 --> 00:11:54,170
I read a tweet
about a New Yorker article about you.

176
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:56,292
The last of the gentlemen sleuths?

177
00:11:56,292 --> 00:11:59,001
You solved that case
with the tennis champ.

178
00:11:59,861 --> 00:12:01,710
You're famous!

179
00:12:02,205 --> 00:12:05,696
Mr. Blanc is not with the police department,
and not officially involved in the case,

180
00:12:05,696 --> 00:12:07,300
but he's offered to consult.

181
00:12:07,762 --> 00:12:09,820
I happily obliged
and I can vouch for him.

182
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:11,900
Mr. Blanc, I know who you are.

183
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:15,340
I read your profile in the New Yorker.
I found it delightful.

184
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:20,685
I just buried my 85 year old father,
who committed suicide.

185
00:12:21,005 --> 00:12:22,749
Why are you here?

186
00:12:24,446 --> 00:12:27,363
I'm here at the behest of a client.

187
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:29,213
Who?

188
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:33,867
I cannot say,
but let me assure you this:

189
00:12:34,369 --> 00:12:37,475
my presence will be ornamental.

190
00:12:37,828 --> 00:12:43,391
You will find me a respectful,
quiet, passive observer

191
00:12:44,522 --> 00:12:46,044
of the truth.

192
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,873
Fine. Are we getting there?

193
00:12:50,226 --> 00:12:52,590
Nearly. Harlan's nurse.

194
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:55,537
She was at the party
in a professional capacity?

195
00:12:55,537 --> 00:12:56,931
Marta?

196
00:12:57,662 --> 00:12:58,789
I guess.

197
00:12:59,098 --> 00:13:02,788
Harlan hired her to be around to take care
of whatever medical needs popped up.

198
00:13:03,455 --> 00:13:06,431
But really she's
like part of the family.

199
00:13:06,709 --> 00:13:09,527
Good kid.
Been a good friend to Harlan.

200
00:13:09,888 --> 00:13:14,003
Family's from Paraguay.
Linda really likes her work ethic.

201
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,221
"Immigrants - we get the job done."

202
00:13:21,699 --> 00:13:23,836
- From Hamilton.
- Oh Hamilton!

203
00:13:24,203 --> 00:13:25,253
It's so good.

204
00:13:25,253 --> 00:13:26,923
I saw it at the public.

205
00:13:29,124 --> 00:13:30,417
May I just...

206
00:13:31,305 --> 00:13:32,741
Then, I'll recede, but...

207
00:13:33,587 --> 00:13:35,874
As a self-made man myself,

208
00:13:36,658 --> 00:13:41,902
I have to express my admiration
for how you've followed in your father's footsteps.

209
00:13:43,213 --> 00:13:43,985
Thank you.

210
00:13:43,985 --> 00:13:47,642
Just marvelous, you know.
The whole family too.

211
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:52,135
Joni with her thing,
Walt with his publishing empire.

212
00:13:54,339 --> 00:13:55,587
Well.

213
00:13:56,746 --> 00:14:01,981
Yes, I mean, Walt, he's done well
with what dad gave him.

214
00:14:02,141 --> 00:14:05,479
Not that it matters, but
really, Dad hands him a book

215
00:14:05,479 --> 00:14:08,256
twice a year, and Walt publishes it.

216
00:14:09,714 --> 00:14:10,636
it's just not the same.

217
00:14:10,636 --> 00:14:16,596
But, surely, Walt runs the merchandising,
adaptations, film and television rights...

218
00:14:17,096 --> 00:14:19,227
Are you baiting me, Detective?

219
00:14:20,214 --> 00:14:21,793
You know he doesn't.

220
00:14:22,287 --> 00:14:24,343
And you think I am dumb enough

221
00:14:24,343 --> 00:14:27,661
to be baited into talking
family business,

222
00:14:27,661 --> 00:14:32,990
into shit talking my baby brother in front of a
police detective and a state trooper...

223
00:14:33,153 --> 00:14:35,215
Walt doesn't run shit!

224
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:37,893
Because there are no
TV and film rights.

225
00:14:38,284 --> 00:14:41,162
Harlan's never allowed
any adaptations of his books.

226
00:14:41,321 --> 00:14:43,352
- Hated the idea.
- No!

227
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:46,250
Yeah! Drives Walt nuts.

228
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:48,458
'Cause that's where the real money is.

229
00:14:48,907 --> 00:14:52,813
Walt would get a little Irish courage in him,
he'd get into it with Harlan.

230
00:14:53,102 --> 00:14:55,656
Did he get "into it" at the party?

231
00:14:56,006 --> 00:14:57,332
Oh my God!

232
00:14:57,332 --> 00:14:58,316
Come one, Dad!

233
00:14:58,316 --> 00:15:02,316
He wouldn't leave him alone, the poor guy.
Harlan finally had to give him the hook.

234
00:15:03,452 --> 00:15:07,230
I didn't hear what he said,
but he must've really handed him his lunch.

235
00:15:07,408 --> 00:15:10,900
'Cause Walt was like a wounded puppy
the rest of the night.

236
00:15:11,106 --> 00:15:14,612
What? Richard said what?
No, Jesus, we did not get "into it."

237
00:15:14,612 --> 00:15:17,489
I'm just trying to get
an accurate impression.

238
00:15:18,355 --> 00:15:23,032
Harlan took you aside at the party,
when you returned you were chastened.

239
00:15:26,377 --> 00:15:27,943
What did Harlan say to you?

240
00:15:29,889 --> 00:15:32,897
The Netflix guys, their business affairs guy,
he sent something over,

241
00:15:32,897 --> 00:15:35,755
it's hard numbers this time,
and I just think this is a window,

242
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,563
that's not gonna stay open,
we need to take advantage of it,

243
00:15:38,563 --> 00:15:40,533
but then you just need
to look at the numbers.

244
00:15:41,027 --> 00:15:42,384
- Walt.
- Dad!

245
00:15:43,172 --> 00:15:48,188
You put me in charge of our books,
let me be in charge, let me do this! Please.

246
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:52,066
They're not our books, son.
They're my books.

247
00:15:53,007 --> 00:15:56,033
And this is not how I wanted
to have this conversation.

248
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,324
But you're right,
you're right, it's...

249
00:15:58,622 --> 00:16:02,158
It's unfair of me to keep you tethered

250
00:16:02,514 --> 00:16:05,187
to something that isn't yours to control.

251
00:16:05,187 --> 00:16:06,528
What?

252
00:16:07,004 --> 00:16:10,137
I've done you a grave disservice.

253
00:16:11,119 --> 00:16:14,313
All these years I have kept you from

254
00:16:14,313 --> 00:16:18,102
building something of your own,
that was yours.

255
00:16:19,948 --> 00:16:25,014
But you're not going to be running
the publishing house anymore.

256
00:16:25,694 --> 00:16:27,128
You're free of it.

257
00:16:30,451 --> 00:16:32,256
Dad, are you firing me?

258
00:16:34,459 --> 00:16:36,365
We'll talk about details tomorrow.

259
00:16:37,065 --> 00:16:41,038
My mind's made up. Good boy.

260
00:16:49,187 --> 00:16:52,878
We talked, we had a business discussion
about e-books.

261
00:16:53,957 --> 00:16:56,081
Jesus, it was nothing.

262
00:16:57,104 --> 00:17:00,206
You wanna talk about an argument,
hell, Ransom had an argument with him.

263
00:17:00,206 --> 00:17:03,192
Ransom, that's Richard and Linda's son?

264
00:17:04,407 --> 00:17:07,126
Look, we all love Ransom,
he's a good kid, we love him.

265
00:17:09,686 --> 00:17:10,962
But?

266
00:17:10,962 --> 00:17:13,263
But he's always been
the black sheep of the family.

267
00:17:14,879 --> 00:17:17,708
I'm not trying to... I like to keep
stuff like this in the family,

268
00:17:17,708 --> 00:17:20,774
but with Ransom,
he's never had a job.

269
00:17:20,948 --> 00:17:25,043
And dad for some unknown reason
always supported him.

270
00:17:25,181 --> 00:17:28,615
They have this love hate bond.
They fight.

271
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:32,050
But that night, God,
they had a blow out.

272
00:17:32,613 --> 00:17:33,698
About what?

273
00:17:33,698 --> 00:17:35,698
Are you, goddamn, insane?

274
00:17:35,711 --> 00:17:38,302
We couldn't make it out really,
but it was huge.

275
00:17:38,881 --> 00:17:41,952
And it's strange they went
into another room to do it.

276
00:17:42,094 --> 00:17:46,012
Usually, they like to stoke up drama
in front of the whole family.

277
00:17:46,419 --> 00:17:48,248
Speaking of getting into it.

278
00:17:49,251 --> 00:17:52,743
You were at the house early
to help the caterer set up.

279
00:17:53,678 --> 00:17:56,836
Did you converse
with Harlan at that time?

280
00:17:57,864 --> 00:17:59,749
Well, he was there,
we must have spoke.

281
00:18:00,008 --> 00:18:01,424
In his study?

282
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:04,729
I don't think so.

283
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:07,917
You see, I spoke with the caterer
this morning.

284
00:18:08,009 --> 00:18:10,831
She didn't see you
helping her staff,

285
00:18:10,831 --> 00:18:16,279
She did hear Harlan in a screaming match
with someone that afternoon in his study.

286
00:18:17,091 --> 00:18:19,682
I don't... A screaming match?

287
00:18:20,952 --> 00:18:21,976
No.

288
00:18:23,416 --> 00:18:26,419
But Joni was here too, she was early.

289
00:18:26,419 --> 00:18:28,782
So, it might have been her,
maybe ask her.

290
00:18:28,782 --> 00:18:30,629
These were two male voices.

291
00:18:30,905 --> 00:18:32,775
Harlan shouted the phrase.

292
00:18:32,775 --> 00:18:35,115
You tell her or I will!

293
00:18:35,632 --> 00:18:39,605
"You tell her or I will."

294
00:18:41,345 --> 00:18:42,893
Bells ringing?

295
00:18:51,568 --> 00:18:54,179
That's none of your business.
You stay out of my marriage!

296
00:18:54,179 --> 00:18:57,415
I know my daughter.
And she would want to know.

297
00:18:57,415 --> 00:19:01,525
I've put it all of it in this letter to her.
Tomorrow she gets it.

298
00:19:01,525 --> 00:19:05,247
Harlan, I'm warning you.
You stay out of my marriage!

299
00:19:05,247 --> 00:19:07,193
She deserves to know
and you gonna tell her.

300
00:19:07,193 --> 00:19:10,240
- The hell I am.
- You tell her or I will!

301
00:19:12,919 --> 00:19:15,040
Yes. I know.

302
00:19:16,705 --> 00:19:17,985
Yes.

303
00:19:20,476 --> 00:19:25,468
Harlan finally decided to put his mom
in a nursing home.

304
00:19:25,647 --> 00:19:27,442
Linda'd always opposed that.

305
00:19:27,524 --> 00:19:31,297
And I wanted to wait
until we got back from Boston to tell Linda.

306
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:33,723
To avoid the whole scene.

307
00:19:33,723 --> 00:19:36,893
And Harlan wanted me
to tell her then.

308
00:19:37,844 --> 00:19:39,022
That was it.

309
00:19:39,754 --> 00:19:41,715
Sorry. Forgot.

310
00:19:42,521 --> 00:19:43,879
The house?

311
00:19:44,367 --> 00:19:47,162
Early. Richard said you were there.

312
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:49,731
I was. At the house early.

313
00:19:50,775 --> 00:19:52,242
To see Harlan?

314
00:19:53,397 --> 00:19:55,824
To see Harlan. Yes.

315
00:19:57,425 --> 00:19:59,445
What were you seeing Harlan about?

316
00:20:00,226 --> 00:20:04,569
It was just a mix up
with the payment for Meg's tuition.

317
00:20:06,156 --> 00:20:10,685
I'm sorry to press,
what kind of mix up?

318
00:20:12,652 --> 00:20:16,018
The school hasn't got the check yet,
I don't know why Alan didn't mail it.

319
00:20:16,018 --> 00:20:20,072
Well, Alan didn't mail it
because he caught a discrepancy.

320
00:20:21,135 --> 00:20:26,524
Alan's office has been wiring tuition
directly to the school, as per your request.

321
00:20:26,683 --> 00:20:30,096
But Phyllis's office,
that handles your yearly allowance,

322
00:20:30,096 --> 00:20:34,021
has been wiring the tuition money
directly to you as well.

323
00:20:35,087 --> 00:20:39,086
You have been double dipping Meg's tuition,
and stealing from me.

324
00:20:39,659 --> 00:20:43,864
100 thousand dollars a year.
For the past four years.

325
00:20:43,864 --> 00:20:46,257
Harlan, I don't know how this mix up
happened, but...

326
00:20:46,257 --> 00:20:49,337
So, now I am writing this tuition check,

327
00:20:49,494 --> 00:20:55,446
but you must know that this is
the last money you or Meg will get from me.

328
00:20:55,644 --> 00:20:56,997
Please, you don't understand.

329
00:20:56,997 --> 00:21:00,698
Joni, I know it'll hurt,
but it's all for the best.

330
00:21:02,224 --> 00:21:04,150
My mind's made up.

331
00:21:06,553 --> 00:21:10,499
It was a money wiring issue
with the office at the school.

332
00:21:10,629 --> 00:21:14,115
So, I had to ask Harlan
to cut a check for this semester.

333
00:21:14,284 --> 00:21:15,642
No big deal.

334
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:20,634
Why don't we just take
a little break and we'll resume...

335
00:21:21,819 --> 00:21:23,849
She's gone.

336
00:21:30,746 --> 00:21:32,242
Richard.

337
00:21:33,398 --> 00:21:34,868
Joni. Have you seen Richard?

338
00:21:34,868 --> 00:21:36,373
No, I was just in with the...

339
00:21:36,373 --> 00:21:37,964
Okay, thanks.

340
00:21:39,336 --> 00:21:40,668
No.

341
00:21:41,127 --> 00:21:42,781
Goddammit! Richard!

342
00:21:44,871 --> 00:21:46,340
Richard.

343
00:22:15,471 --> 00:22:17,453
Son of a bitch!

344
00:22:27,821 --> 00:22:30,582
I might be a victim
of my own expectations here.

345
00:22:30,582 --> 00:22:33,666
But when the great Benoit Blanc
comes knocking at my door

346
00:22:34,423 --> 00:22:40,062
I expect it's going to be about something,
if not extraordinary, then at least interesting.

347
00:22:41,103 --> 00:22:44,330
I'm sorry, this is an
open and shut case of suicide and...

348
00:22:44,808 --> 00:22:47,914
Quite frankly, Benny, we're getting to the point
where I need to know what we're doing here.

349
00:22:47,914 --> 00:22:49,519
The method.

350
00:22:50,604 --> 00:22:52,121
Throat slit.

351
00:22:52,701 --> 00:22:54,720
Typical for a suicide?

352
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,377
I mean, that's dramatic. But look around.

353
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:01,162
I mean, the guy practically lives
in a clue board.

354
00:23:10,556 --> 00:23:12,564
You told me
to invite all of these people back

355
00:23:12,913 --> 00:23:15,687
for questioning all over again.
I don't get it.

356
00:23:21,468 --> 00:23:25,936
This is a pleasant family with the usual quarrels,
but no possible motives for murder.

357
00:23:26,235 --> 00:23:27,914
Where are you going?

358
00:23:32,071 --> 00:23:34,678
Harlan Thrombey's nurse, Marta...

359
00:23:35,186 --> 00:23:36,951
- Cabrera.
- Marta Cabrera.

360
00:23:36,951 --> 00:23:38,825
Miss Cabrera, you can just wait inside
and we'll be...

361
00:23:38,825 --> 00:23:40,285
Miss Cabrera.

362
00:23:43,171 --> 00:23:45,113
I've been doing a little poking.

363
00:23:45,755 --> 00:23:49,405
You are hired on a part time basis
as a registered nurse, yes?

364
00:23:49,589 --> 00:23:53,666
Yes, I don't work for a VNA.
Harlan hired me directly.

365
00:23:53,666 --> 00:23:55,141
Take a seat, please.

366
00:23:55,834 --> 00:24:01,044
And you're paid a flat rate
for how many hours a week?

367
00:24:02,569 --> 00:24:05,368
Well, I started at 15, and then he...

368
00:24:06,495 --> 00:24:08,888
- He needed more help.
- Medical help?

369
00:24:11,789 --> 00:24:13,401
He needed a friend.

370
00:24:15,641 --> 00:24:19,780
Does having a kind heart
make you a good nurse?

371
00:24:20,193 --> 00:24:22,285
All right, Blanc, I mean.
This is...

372
00:24:22,285 --> 00:24:26,325
Marta, we were just discussing
possible motives in the family.

373
00:24:26,632 --> 00:24:31,446
I suspect that Harlan has told you
much unfiltered truth about each of them.

374
00:24:31,446 --> 00:24:34,185
And a little bird has told me,

375
00:24:34,734 --> 00:24:37,038
how should I put this delicately?

376
00:24:38,105 --> 00:24:43,831
You have a regurgitive reaction
to mistruthin'.

377
00:24:45,159 --> 00:24:46,442
Who told you that?

378
00:24:46,442 --> 00:24:48,134
Is it true?

379
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:51,873
Yes.

380
00:24:52,036 --> 00:24:54,304
It's something I had
since I was a kid.

381
00:24:54,304 --> 00:24:56,494
It's a physically thing that I...

382
00:24:56,832 --> 00:25:00,747
Just the thought of lying,
yeah, it makes me puke.

383
00:25:01,013 --> 00:25:02,427
Really?

384
00:25:06,366 --> 00:25:08,600
Is Richard having an affair?

385
00:25:12,931 --> 00:25:18,686
Why do men instinctively
pull at loose threads on their parachutes?

386
00:25:19,406 --> 00:25:20,732
What?

387
00:25:28,297 --> 00:25:29,710
Richard?

388
00:25:31,296 --> 00:25:33,039
An affair?

389
00:25:33,897 --> 00:25:36,244
<i>A yes or no will do.</i>

390
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:40,725
No.

391
00:25:44,309 --> 00:25:45,699
Oh shit!

392
00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:49,571
Dear girl I'm sorry. I assumed you
were speaking figuratively.

393
00:25:50,775 --> 00:25:53,466
Here, here. Just take a sip of this.

394
00:25:53,466 --> 00:25:55,707
Take that. Quite something.

395
00:25:56,872 --> 00:25:58,774
But I was obviously right.

396
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:03,005
Richard is having an affair, his father-in-law
found out and confronted him.

397
00:26:03,055 --> 00:26:04,432
"You tell her or I will."

398
00:26:04,432 --> 00:26:06,275
Okay, but even if that was a case...

399
00:26:06,571 --> 00:26:08,058
- You all right?
- Yeah.

400
00:26:08,058 --> 00:26:09,545
Even if that was a case, I mean,

401
00:26:09,545 --> 00:26:12,590
protecting a relationship as a motive,
that's weak sauce, you know that.

402
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:14,864
Well. And then there is Joni.

403
00:26:15,166 --> 00:26:17,566
Joni? Lifestyle guru Joni?

404
00:26:17,566 --> 00:26:20,328
No. Harlan was supporting her and her daughter,
and that's the opposite of a motive.

405
00:26:20,328 --> 00:26:23,259
And if that support was threatened?
Miss Cabrera one moment please.

406
00:26:23,259 --> 00:26:24,752
Yes, I just wanna
get some Scope.

407
00:26:24,752 --> 00:26:26,085
Miss Cabrera.

408
00:26:27,133 --> 00:26:30,992
Was Harlan planning on
cutting off Joni's allowance?

409
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:35,153
Oh, Joni.

410
00:26:36,461 --> 00:26:37,838
What's up?

411
00:26:40,857 --> 00:26:41,912
Oh my God.

412
00:26:42,088 --> 00:26:43,639
Don't answer that
if you're gonna puke again.

413
00:26:43,639 --> 00:26:48,173
Meg said he paid the school directly,
Joni said he sends the money to her.

414
00:26:48,173 --> 00:26:49,816
Both were true.

415
00:26:50,162 --> 00:26:55,469
She was pocketing the double payment.
Harlan found out and cut her off without a cent. Yes?

416
00:26:56,054 --> 00:26:59,086
So she bumps him off
for the inheritance?

417
00:26:59,138 --> 00:27:02,225
Come on! No. Have you seen
her insta? She's an influencer.

418
00:27:02,225 --> 00:27:05,455
No. Allowance as a motive?
Again, more weak sauce.

419
00:27:05,678 --> 00:27:07,432
You're just dumping that bag
of weak sauce on it.

420
00:27:07,432 --> 00:27:09,653
Granted. But she lied to me.

421
00:27:10,312 --> 00:27:11,885
All three of them did.

422
00:27:11,885 --> 00:27:12,964
Three?

423
00:27:14,486 --> 00:27:15,654
Walter.

424
00:27:16,638 --> 00:27:17,876
I see where you are going with this.

425
00:27:17,876 --> 00:27:20,614
Harlan had turned Walter down before
regarding film rights.

426
00:27:20,614 --> 00:27:23,525
But that night something Harlan said
shook him.

427
00:27:23,525 --> 00:27:26,995
Now, we look at the pattern.
Harlan was cleaning house.

428
00:27:28,103 --> 00:27:29,421
I wonder...

429
00:27:29,831 --> 00:27:31,905
Did he plan to fire Walter?

430
00:27:31,905 --> 00:27:34,186
Can I wait inside?
I feel like I shouldn't be here.

431
00:27:34,186 --> 00:27:36,685
Yeah, please just wait inside,
stay close, all right?

432
00:27:41,559 --> 00:27:43,583
You have been very patient my friend.

433
00:27:44,593 --> 00:27:47,245
And yes. You are right.

434
00:27:47,245 --> 00:27:51,477
None of these weak alibis
and domestic squibbles answer your question:

435
00:27:51,477 --> 00:27:53,873
Why is Benoit Blanc here?

436
00:27:54,817 --> 00:27:56,939
Well, now I will tell you why.

437
00:27:57,846 --> 00:28:02,985
I'm here because this morning
someone dodged a very important question.

438
00:28:03,653 --> 00:28:04,842
Who?

439
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:08,739
Me. Linda asked who hired me.

440
00:28:10,107 --> 00:28:11,420
Who hired you?

441
00:28:11,614 --> 00:28:13,440
I do not know.

442
00:28:14,194 --> 00:28:16,952
An envelope of cash showed up
at my apartment yesterday,

443
00:28:16,952 --> 00:28:19,291
with the news,
clipping of Thrombey's death.

444
00:28:19,291 --> 00:28:20,958
An envelope? That worked?

445
00:28:22,621 --> 00:28:24,413
An envelope of cash.

446
00:28:25,455 --> 00:28:28,076
So, somebody suspects foul play,

447
00:28:28,076 --> 00:28:32,670
and goes through this ha cha dance
of hiring me, of staying anonymous.

448
00:28:33,385 --> 00:28:36,136
It makes no damn sense.

449
00:28:37,598 --> 00:28:39,387
Compels me though.

450
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:44,108
Walk me through everyone's
whereabouts at the time of death.

451
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:48,373
We know that the party
ended around 11:30.

452
00:28:48,816 --> 00:28:49,689
Goodnight, Joni.

453
00:28:49,689 --> 00:28:52,347
Marta took Harlan upstairs
to give him his meds.

454
00:28:54,312 --> 00:28:59,076
The stairs leading up to Harlan's bedroom
and his attic office creak horribly.

455
00:28:59,621 --> 00:29:01,555
And Linda is a light sleeper.

456
00:29:01,555 --> 00:29:04,314
So we know every time someone
took the stairs that night.

457
00:29:07,428 --> 00:29:11,825
The first was when Joni heard a ka-thunk
from somewhere above her in the house.

458
00:29:21,082 --> 00:29:24,545
She's concerned about Harlan,
so she goes up to investigate,

459
00:29:25,865 --> 00:29:27,478
waking Linda.

460
00:29:28,028 --> 00:29:30,026
Harlan was in his attic office with Marta.

461
00:29:30,072 --> 00:29:31,962
- Hi, Joni.
- I just ... Hi.

462
00:29:31,962 --> 00:29:33,908
He explained that they
had just knocked over the GO board.

463
00:29:33,908 --> 00:29:35,507
I just knocked over the GO board.

464
00:29:35,507 --> 00:29:39,463
That game with the grid and stones,
they play it every night, and he was fine.

465
00:29:39,463 --> 00:29:41,671
- Go to bed.
- Go to bed, Joni.

466
00:29:41,776 --> 00:29:42,989
- Love you.
- Love you.

467
00:29:42,989 --> 00:29:44,365
So she did.

468
00:29:45,736 --> 00:29:49,140
Ten minutes later,
Linda is awoken a second time

469
00:29:51,112 --> 00:29:52,256
by Marta leaving.

470
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:53,809
Walt, I'm leaving!

471
00:29:54,329 --> 00:29:56,763
Walt was smoking a cigar
on the porch with his son.

472
00:29:56,763 --> 00:29:59,010
He saw her leave and drive off.

473
00:30:00,077 --> 00:30:02,468
Noted the time - midnight.

474
00:30:09,163 --> 00:30:13,520
Fifteen minutes later, Linda is awoken
for the third and final time

475
00:30:15,793 --> 00:30:17,877
by someone coming down the stairs.

476
00:30:17,877 --> 00:30:20,255
Harlan, who came down
for a midnight snack.

477
00:30:20,404 --> 00:30:21,910
Dad, go to bed!

478
00:30:22,088 --> 00:30:24,185
Which Walt tried to discourage.

479
00:30:24,992 --> 00:30:30,997
Based on this, the medical examiner determined
the time of death to be between 12:15 and 2 AM.

480
00:30:30,997 --> 00:30:34,842
As Walt was finishing his cigar,
about 12:30, Meg came home.

481
00:30:34,989 --> 00:30:38,907
She went straight to bed.
Walt and Jacob turned in shortly after that.

482
00:30:41,224 --> 00:30:46,026
Sometime later that night,
it's undetermined, but possibly near 3 AM,

483
00:30:46,447 --> 00:30:49,370
Meg woke up because the dogs
were barking outside.

484
00:30:49,370 --> 00:30:52,154
She used the bathroom,
went back to bed.

485
00:30:52,608 --> 00:30:54,383
That's it, all right?

486
00:30:54,383 --> 00:30:58,085
Everyone's stories matched,
every moment accounted for.

487
00:30:59,167 --> 00:31:02,482
And there is no other staircase
up to Harlan's room?

488
00:31:02,496 --> 00:31:04,366
None. Just the creaky one.

489
00:31:04,366 --> 00:31:05,559
Interesting.

490
00:31:05,559 --> 00:31:09,621
So, we know that Ransom didn't do it
because he wasn't there.

491
00:31:09,766 --> 00:31:13,333
Marta couldn't have.
Harlan was still alive when she left.

492
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:17,279
Meg? Meg came home during the window
of the time of death.

493
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:21,734
Except it was a suicide, all right?
Harlan slit right through his carotid.

494
00:31:21,734 --> 00:31:24,871
We saw from the blood splat patterns
that they were uninterrupted,

495
00:31:24,871 --> 00:31:28,569
meaning, It's almost impossible for anyone
to have been around him at the time.

496
00:31:29,851 --> 00:31:32,453
He's the one who cut his own throat, all right?
I don't know why we keep going over this.

497
00:31:32,453 --> 00:31:36,821
Physical evidence can tell
a clear story with a forked tongue.

498
00:31:36,821 --> 00:31:38,149
What?

499
00:31:38,149 --> 00:31:42,554
And as we can see from this morning.
Everyone can lie.

500
00:31:44,278 --> 00:31:47,220
Well. Almost everyone.

501
00:31:49,554 --> 00:31:51,068
Miss Cabrera.

502
00:31:52,111 --> 00:31:55,841
We kept you waiting all afternoon
because I wanted to hear from you last.

503
00:31:57,159 --> 00:32:00,843
I needed an entire picture
of the evening in my head.

504
00:32:01,688 --> 00:32:05,333
Your piece of it
is at its very center.

505
00:32:06,576 --> 00:32:09,181
So please, take your time.

506
00:32:11,084 --> 00:32:17,502
You took Mr. Thrombey upstairs
at 11:30, and left at midnight.

507
00:32:18,137 --> 00:32:23,264
Think very carefully
and with as much detail as possible.

508
00:32:24,119 --> 00:32:26,943
Tell us what happened
in that half hour.

509
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,304
- I got it.
- You got it?

510
00:32:34,744 --> 00:32:36,082
I got it.

511
00:32:36,734 --> 00:32:38,736
Okay, that's... Hey.

512
00:32:38,988 --> 00:32:41,240
Harlan. Let's...

513
00:32:42,474 --> 00:32:44,331
There are no second thoughts!

514
00:32:44,515 --> 00:32:46,036
No, no.

515
00:32:46,097 --> 00:32:47,781
- Get up here!
- I had dose of champagne.

516
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:50,919
You only had one glass.

517
00:32:51,258 --> 00:32:54,846
We are not breaking tradition
on my birthday!

518
00:32:54,846 --> 00:32:57,248
Can you just take your
goddamn medicine and go to bed?

519
00:32:57,248 --> 00:33:02,256
If you're gonna put that vile shit in me
you'll have to earn it. On my birthday.

520
00:33:02,256 --> 00:33:04,802
- 85th birthday.
- Fine, Jesus.

521
00:33:04,802 --> 00:33:06,502
I'm so old.

522
00:33:07,136 --> 00:33:08,816
You really love drama, huh?

523
00:33:10,106 --> 00:33:13,077
Okay, let's do this, 9 by 9.
You ready?

524
00:33:13,302 --> 00:33:14,867
- I'll whip your ass.
- Are you sure?

525
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:17,844
How dare you?

526
00:33:20,198 --> 00:33:21,938
I know how this is gonna end.

527
00:33:23,185 --> 00:33:24,568
What is that?

528
00:33:24,568 --> 00:33:26,389
Why can't I beat you at this game?

529
00:33:26,389 --> 00:33:29,462
Because I'm not playing to beat you,
I'm playing to built a beautiful pattern.

530
00:33:29,462 --> 00:33:32,643
That's elder abuse. I'm gonna call the AARP.

531
00:33:32,643 --> 00:33:34,505
Don't make me get the belt,
I would, you know.

532
00:33:34,505 --> 00:33:36,286
It's basically over.

533
00:33:37,078 --> 00:33:39,228
My only hope is
that an earthquake will strike.

534
00:33:40,207 --> 00:33:42,185
But what are the chances?

535
00:33:45,452 --> 00:33:47,178
Hello?

536
00:33:48,763 --> 00:33:50,436
Get under a door frame!

537
00:33:55,495 --> 00:33:58,735
Such a bad loser you are.
Meds, then bed.

538
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,465
I'm done with you.

539
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:02,371
That's fair.

540
00:34:05,484 --> 00:34:10,339
Walt is smoking that filthy cigar
out there on the porch. Nasty things.

541
00:34:12,222 --> 00:34:13,556
How was tonight?

542
00:34:13,556 --> 00:34:15,839
Tonight was good.

543
00:34:16,561 --> 00:34:19,881
Oh, yeah? I know you weren't
looking forward to it.

544
00:34:19,881 --> 00:34:24,711
No. But I did it.
I cut the line on all four of them.

545
00:34:27,507 --> 00:34:32,215
It wasn't easy. This goddamn fortune.

546
00:34:34,243 --> 00:34:37,530
You know, sometimes I think that
everything I've given my family,

547
00:34:37,530 --> 00:34:43,367
I've done maybe, without knowing,
or maybe, to keep them beneath me.

548
00:34:44,839 --> 00:34:47,146
I certainly should have...
I don't know...

549
00:34:47,488 --> 00:34:51,058
encouraged Walt to write
his own stories,

550
00:34:51,058 --> 00:34:54,966
not just be a caretaker of mine.

551
00:34:55,177 --> 00:34:56,982
Like you said I should.

552
00:34:57,388 --> 00:35:02,439
And then be a father, not just a provider
for Joni, like you've also said.

553
00:35:02,762 --> 00:35:06,067
I could've been kinder
to Linda and Ransom.

554
00:35:07,196 --> 00:35:09,107
Jesus, Ransom.

555
00:35:10,998 --> 00:35:14,471
There's so much of me in that kid.

556
00:35:15,532 --> 00:35:19,059
Confident, stupid, I dunno.

557
00:35:19,059 --> 00:35:25,071
Protected. Playing life like a game
without consequence,

558
00:35:27,199 --> 00:35:29,459
until you can't tell the difference

559
00:35:30,065 --> 00:35:34,354
between a stage prop
and a real knife.

560
00:35:36,039 --> 00:35:37,853
I don't fear death.

561
00:35:38,375 --> 00:35:43,647
But, oh God, I'd like to fix
some of this before I go.

562
00:35:44,022 --> 00:35:46,186
Close the book with a flourish.

563
00:35:49,434 --> 00:35:51,058
I guess we'll see.

564
00:35:51,929 --> 00:35:53,460
I guess we will.

565
00:35:58,629 --> 00:35:59,682
Hey.

566
00:36:00,041 --> 00:36:03,637
You had a long day.
You wanna do drugs.

567
00:36:04,265 --> 00:36:06,446
- You mean the good stuff?
- Yeah.

568
00:36:07,531 --> 00:36:11,147
Come on, send me to lala land.

569
00:36:11,147 --> 00:36:13,244
Just a tiny bit, okay?

570
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:16,788
Why did I wait till my mid 80s
to become a morphine user.

571
00:36:16,788 --> 00:36:19,780
What a schmuck.
What a nud-nig.

572
00:36:21,249 --> 00:36:22,579
This stuff is the best.

573
00:36:28,195 --> 00:36:29,897
Oh my god!

574
00:36:30,864 --> 00:36:32,288
Is there a problem?

575
00:36:34,957 --> 00:36:37,640
This is what I just gave you
a 100 milligrams of.

576
00:36:39,019 --> 00:36:40,407
I messed up.

577
00:36:40,707 --> 00:36:44,195
You gave me a 100 milligrams
of the good stuff?

578
00:36:46,481 --> 00:36:50,616
Excuse me, but what is the good stuff's
dosage supposed to be?

579
00:36:50,818 --> 00:36:53,839
Let's not call it that right now, okay?
Three milligrams.

580
00:36:53,996 --> 00:36:57,147
That's much less. So what happens?

581
00:36:57,824 --> 00:37:01,767
I'm gonna give you an emergency shot
of Naloxone, so that you don't die in ten minutes.

582
00:37:01,838 --> 00:37:03,177
Well, no pressure.

583
00:37:04,611 --> 00:37:07,378
You know, this is
an interesting and efficient

584
00:37:07,891 --> 00:37:10,453
method of murder.
I need to write this down.

585
00:37:10,826 --> 00:37:16,391
So, if someone switched the meds
on purpose, I'd be dead in ten minutes.

586
00:37:17,013 --> 00:37:18,673
Like stone cold dead?

587
00:37:18,673 --> 00:37:22,259
Yes, you'll feel symptoms in five.
Sweats, disorientation, and then...

588
00:37:23,371 --> 00:37:26,157
Yes, that big dose injected,
within ten your

589
00:37:26,852 --> 00:37:30,415
Your brain... Yes, ten minutes.

590
00:37:30,415 --> 00:37:32,546
Yeah, from the moment of injection.

591
00:37:32,848 --> 00:37:34,247
It's eightish now.

592
00:37:34,247 --> 00:37:38,532
And even if the victim called
for an ambulance when he first felt symptoms,

593
00:37:38,532 --> 00:37:42,032
and if he lived in a great
big country house like we do.

594
00:37:42,032 --> 00:37:47,576
The ambulance would take at least
15 minutes to arrive, it'd be too late.

595
00:37:48,741 --> 00:37:52,370
If the victim didn't have
the emergency Naxostuff.

596
00:37:53,906 --> 00:37:57,355
Marta. Do you have the Naxostuff?

597
00:37:57,355 --> 00:37:59,289
Yes, I'm gonna find it.

598
00:37:59,594 --> 00:38:05,086
I have it because it comes with the kit,
it should be here, it has to be, it's like a...

599
00:38:14,918 --> 00:38:18,977
It's not here, Harlan.
I don't know, it's not here.

600
00:38:18,977 --> 00:38:20,906
So, I'm gonna use the phone, okay?

601
00:38:21,614 --> 00:38:23,366
To call an ambulance.

602
00:38:36,352 --> 00:38:37,786
What are you doing?

603
00:38:39,667 --> 00:38:41,278
What are you doing?

604
00:38:42,869 --> 00:38:44,836
Marta, listen to me.

605
00:38:44,972 --> 00:38:45,846
Harlan, I need to...

606
00:38:45,846 --> 00:38:49,284
Stop this! Stop this, Marta!
There is no time, you have to listen!

607
00:38:49,284 --> 00:38:50,782
I'm calling the family!

608
00:38:55,209 --> 00:38:57,487
What are you doing?
Are you nuts?

609
00:38:58,093 --> 00:39:00,340
Harlan, we have to call the ambulance,
we don't have time!

610
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:01,689
Listen to me!

611
00:39:02,815 --> 00:39:05,860
If what you said is true,
I'm gone, there's no saving me.

612
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:08,132
We have six minutes.

613
00:39:08,721 --> 00:39:12,376
We have got to get you out of this.
Think of your mom.

614
00:39:12,938 --> 00:39:14,216
My mom?

615
00:39:16,159 --> 00:39:18,533
Get behind, get behind.
Don't make a noise.

616
00:39:19,383 --> 00:39:20,382
Harlan?

617
00:39:21,225 --> 00:39:23,586
Marta? Everything all right?

618
00:39:24,376 --> 00:39:26,451
- Hi, Joni.
- Hi.

619
00:39:26,639 --> 00:39:28,708
I thought I heard something.
Is everything okay?

620
00:39:29,082 --> 00:39:30,455
We're fine.

621
00:39:31,367 --> 00:39:34,762
I just knocked over
the GO board, sorry about that.

622
00:39:34,954 --> 00:39:36,023
Everyone's all right?

623
00:39:36,023 --> 00:39:38,794
Yes, fine. Go to bed Joni.

624
00:39:38,794 --> 00:39:43,112
Okay. Maybe, we can talk tomorrow
about the thing with..

625
00:39:43,112 --> 00:39:44,644
Tomorrow is fine.

626
00:39:44,987 --> 00:39:46,182
- Love you.
- Love you.

627
00:39:46,182 --> 00:39:48,031
Night.

628
00:39:51,056 --> 00:39:52,528
Come on.

629
00:39:53,225 --> 00:39:54,874
Pay attention now.

630
00:39:55,375 --> 00:39:58,674
Your mom is still undocumented,

631
00:39:58,674 --> 00:40:00,342
and if this is your fault

632
00:40:00,494 --> 00:40:05,088
she'll be found out and, at best, deported,
and your family will be broken.

633
00:40:05,088 --> 00:40:07,467
But we're not gonna let
that happen, are we?

634
00:40:07,963 --> 00:40:10,532
But you have to do exactly
what I tell you.

635
00:40:11,032 --> 00:40:12,939
Will you do this Marta?

636
00:40:14,493 --> 00:40:19,044
This last thing.
For me. For your family.

637
00:40:22,548 --> 00:40:24,447
What do you want me to do?

638
00:40:25,684 --> 00:40:30,232
Go downstairs as noisily as you can,
and then say goodbye loudly.

639
00:40:30,232 --> 00:40:31,240
Walt! I'm leaving!

640
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:32,650
Call attention to the time.

641
00:40:32,650 --> 00:40:33,889
God, it's midnight already.

642
00:40:33,889 --> 00:40:35,194
If you can.

643
00:40:36,652 --> 00:40:39,931
Drive out the gate, then to avoid
the security cameras,

644
00:40:39,931 --> 00:40:43,335
pull off the road
before the carved elephant.

645
00:40:44,583 --> 00:40:46,684
Wait, was it before or after?

646
00:40:46,684 --> 00:40:48,110
<i>After the carved elephant.</i>

647
00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:50,197
No, he said before? Was it?

648
00:40:50,197 --> 00:40:51,855
<i>Beafterfore the carved elephant.</i>

649
00:40:51,855 --> 00:40:53,456
Oh, shit!

650
00:40:56,613 --> 00:41:00,012
Park and come back on foot
up to the house.

651
00:41:00,929 --> 00:41:03,850
Take the side yard path,
through that little gate.

652
00:41:04,745 --> 00:41:07,213
The dogs will know you,
they shouldn't bark.

653
00:41:08,498 --> 00:41:12,146
You've got to get up to the third floor
without being seen.

654
00:41:12,310 --> 00:41:17,328
And the only way is to climb the side trellis
and come in through the trick hall window.

655
00:41:17,734 --> 00:41:20,857
- You gotta be kidding me.
- I am not. Do it.

656
00:41:29,494 --> 00:41:32,286
And for God's sake
don't make any noise.

657
00:41:42,752 --> 00:41:45,428
Once you're inside.
Now, this is the tricky part.

658
00:41:45,722 --> 00:41:47,065
This is the tricky part?

659
00:41:47,335 --> 00:41:52,216
Get my robe and cap
from my bedroom, and put them on.

660
00:41:52,216 --> 00:41:55,197
Harlan, this is crazy.
I don't think I can do...

661
00:41:55,197 --> 00:41:56,805
We need to make this so airtight

662
00:41:56,805 --> 00:42:00,655
that the average cop
will entirely dismiss you as a suspect.

663
00:42:00,655 --> 00:42:02,886
It sounds crazy, but it will work.

664
00:42:07,466 --> 00:42:10,659
Walt is smoking outside,
and he'll see you

665
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:12,823
through the glazed window.

666
00:42:12,823 --> 00:42:15,240
Dad, go back to bed.

667
00:42:16,430 --> 00:42:20,590
You were seen leaving,
the security cameras show you driving off.

668
00:42:20,590 --> 00:42:25,150
And twenty minutes later
I am seen alive and well by my son.

669
00:42:25,538 --> 00:42:30,319
You see, you've gone from suspect
number one to an impossibility.

670
00:42:30,638 --> 00:42:35,896
Leave the way you came,
and don't be seen.

671
00:42:45,924 --> 00:42:47,643
Ransom?

672
00:42:48,665 --> 00:42:51,110
Are you back again already?

673
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:55,640
Drive home.

674
00:42:56,149 --> 00:43:00,330
And sometime, in the next few days
the police will question you.

675
00:43:00,334 --> 00:43:02,406
No, no, no.

676
00:43:03,001 --> 00:43:06,818
I can't lie, you know
I can't lie, I'll puke.

677
00:43:06,818 --> 00:43:08,060
Then don't lie.

678
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:11,424
Tell fragments of the truth.
In this exact order:

679
00:43:18,537 --> 00:43:23,692
I took him upstairs,
we played our nightly game of GO.

680
00:43:25,221 --> 00:43:30,905
At some point he knocked the board over
and Joni came up to check on us.

681
00:43:34,604 --> 00:43:39,302
I gave him pain medication,
he pulled his shoulder last week.

682
00:43:41,195 --> 00:43:45,357
And I left him
in his study at midnight.

683
00:43:45,612 --> 00:43:47,978
I said goodbye to Walt.

684
00:43:49,153 --> 00:43:50,158
Went home.

685
00:43:50,158 --> 00:43:52,313
What kind of medication
did you give him?

686
00:43:55,510 --> 00:44:00,400
Since his injury I've been giving him
a 100 milligram IV push of Toradol.

687
00:44:00,516 --> 00:44:02,538
It's a non narcotic analgesic.

688
00:44:02,948 --> 00:44:06,953
And to help him sleep,
3 milligrams of morphine.

689
00:44:07,341 --> 00:44:10,179
- And the family was aware of this?
- Yes, of course.

690
00:44:10,424 --> 00:44:14,451
Did you notice anything strange,
off about his demeanor?

691
00:44:18,304 --> 00:44:19,835
No.

692
00:44:23,936 --> 00:44:26,003
Sounds about right.

693
00:44:26,678 --> 00:44:28,630
Thank you, Miss Cabrera.

694
00:44:47,182 --> 00:44:50,596
Hey, sis, people are gonna start
getting here for the memorial pretty soon.

695
00:44:50,596 --> 00:44:52,389
Are you..?

696
00:44:54,612 --> 00:44:55,884
Are you all right?

697
00:44:56,340 --> 00:44:58,955
I was just thinking
about Dad's games.

698
00:45:00,663 --> 00:45:05,707
This all feels like one,
like something he'd write, not do.

699
00:45:06,879 --> 00:45:09,741
I keep waiting for the big reveal,

700
00:45:11,478 --> 00:45:16,222
where it all makes sense,
wouldn't that be nice?

701
00:45:16,917 --> 00:45:18,989
Walter.

702
00:45:21,141 --> 00:45:24,765
I don't think he killed himself.
I don't. I really don't.

703
00:45:25,363 --> 00:45:29,159
There's this Hallmark movie called
"Deadly By Surprise" with Danica McKellar.

704
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:33,151
And she plays the wife,
who's getting poisoned by her husband.

705
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:35,951
But he's doing it little by little,
so she doesn't know it.

706
00:45:36,106 --> 00:45:38,318
And she goes crazy
and she kills herself.

707
00:45:38,459 --> 00:45:41,799
And my cousin, who's a receptionist
at the medical examiners office.

708
00:45:41,927 --> 00:45:44,071
She says that stuff totally happens.

709
00:45:44,071 --> 00:45:47,683
Say, with 3% as crazy as this stuff
she's seen come through the...

710
00:45:50,032 --> 00:45:51,789
Oh, God. Yeah, I mean...

711
00:45:51,789 --> 00:45:53,769
You don't like him
because you love him.

712
00:45:53,904 --> 00:45:56,528
No, I don't like him,
he's an asshole.

713
00:45:56,763 --> 00:45:59,416
But maybe, an asshole is what we needed.

714
00:45:59,907 --> 00:46:00,858
God, yeah...

715
00:46:00,858 --> 00:46:04,533
An asshole is what Germany
needed in nineteen thirty... whatever.

716
00:46:04,710 --> 00:46:06,608
Those 2 things don't even complete.

717
00:46:07,441 --> 00:46:11,916
Jesus, I'm gonna disappear
until the politics talk is done.

718
00:46:11,916 --> 00:46:13,663
You want some champers?

719
00:46:14,199 --> 00:46:16,092
I can't. I'm technically working.

720
00:46:16,604 --> 00:46:19,063
Take off your red cap, Richard
and look around you.

721
00:46:19,063 --> 00:46:21,213
The streets
are literally flooded with Nazis.

722
00:46:21,213 --> 00:46:22,396
No, no, no.

723
00:46:22,396 --> 00:46:25,866
We're losing our way of life
and our culture.

724
00:46:26,037 --> 00:46:28,331
There are millions of Mexicans coming.

725
00:46:28,460 --> 00:46:31,307
And don't make this a race thing.
You always make this a race thing.

726
00:46:31,307 --> 00:46:34,971
I would say the same thing
if they were European immigrants.

727
00:46:34,971 --> 00:46:36,881
If the Swiss were like
clogging in the streets...

728
00:46:36,881 --> 00:46:39,763
We allow them in and
they think they own...

729
00:46:39,763 --> 00:46:43,805
They're putting children in cages.
I mean, these are camps!

730
00:46:43,805 --> 00:46:46,711
Come on, Joni.
Nobody's saying that isn't bad,

731
00:46:46,711 --> 00:46:48,490
but the parents
have some blame here.

732
00:46:48,542 --> 00:46:50,903
For what? For wanting a better life
for their kids?

733
00:46:50,903 --> 00:46:52,021
Isn't that what America is..?

734
00:46:52,021 --> 00:46:54,331
For breaking the law.

735
00:46:54,761 --> 00:46:57,469
And you gonna hate hearing this,
but it's true.

736
00:46:57,469 --> 00:46:59,533
- America is for Americans.
- Don't point at me!

737
00:46:59,533 --> 00:47:01,085
Where is Marta,
is she still here?

738
00:47:01,085 --> 00:47:05,391
Marta. Come on over.
Marta, please. Come over.

739
00:47:06,168 --> 00:47:11,349
Marta, your family is from Uruguay,
but you did it right.

740
00:47:11,843 --> 00:47:15,695
What I'm saying is, they did it legally.
She did it the right way.

741
00:47:16,026 --> 00:47:19,989
You work hard, and you'll earn
your share from the ground up

742
00:47:19,989 --> 00:47:22,629
just like Dad
and like all the rest of us.

743
00:47:22,629 --> 00:47:24,205
And I bet
you agree with me, right?

744
00:47:24,205 --> 00:47:26,736
Just leave the poor girl
alone, Richard.

745
00:47:26,736 --> 00:47:29,390
It's okay, I just wanna
hear what she has to say.

746
00:47:29,390 --> 00:47:30,343
It's okay, Marta, you can speak.

747
00:47:30,343 --> 00:47:32,353
Oh, sweetheart, don't feel
pressured to answer.

748
00:47:32,690 --> 00:47:38,102
Look, if you wanna become an American,
there are legal ways to do it.

749
00:47:38,763 --> 00:47:42,415
But if you break the law,
it doesn't matter how good you heart is,

750
00:47:42,790 --> 00:47:45,159
you gotta face the consequences.

751
00:47:45,503 --> 00:47:47,672
Are you, goddamn, insane?

752
00:47:47,672 --> 00:47:49,747
- Hey!
- I warn you!

753
00:47:55,573 --> 00:47:58,754
So I ask her, I'm like, Tonya,
what is wrong with people literally?

754
00:47:59,487 --> 00:48:01,391
Oh my God, Marta. What?

755
00:48:01,918 --> 00:48:04,093
Marta! What's the matter?

756
00:48:04,438 --> 00:48:08,075
Whoa, hey. Breathe.
Marta, are you okay?

757
00:48:09,696 --> 00:48:11,853
Hey, Fran, do you still have
your stash?

758
00:48:17,496 --> 00:48:18,976
Take 'em whenever you need 'em.

759
00:48:18,976 --> 00:48:21,124
They're just drying out
since you gave me that Juul.

760
00:48:21,443 --> 00:48:22,787
Thanks Fran.

761
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:23,892
Hey.

762
00:48:23,892 --> 00:48:26,821
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm very very sorry.

763
00:48:26,821 --> 00:48:29,413
Stop. Stop saying
you're sorry, Jesus.

764
00:48:29,774 --> 00:48:31,910
God, my heart won't stop, I can't...

765
00:48:33,595 --> 00:48:35,821
It's just everything.
No, thank you.

766
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:40,287
That's where Fran keeps her stash?

767
00:48:42,119 --> 00:48:43,534
Who's gonna open a clock?

768
00:48:45,129 --> 00:48:50,046
Do you want dinner, Nana?
Dinner? To eat? To eat?

769
00:48:51,950 --> 00:48:54,798
Walt, she's fine, she ate
the entire salmon spread already.

770
00:48:56,863 --> 00:48:59,507
Walt, did you tell Marta yet,
what we all talked about?

771
00:48:59,507 --> 00:49:01,279
No, not yet.
Is now a good time?

772
00:49:01,279 --> 00:49:03,462
Yes, yes a very good time.
Right now.

773
00:49:03,743 --> 00:49:07,603
Okay, all right.
Calm down. Calm down.

774
00:49:09,314 --> 00:49:13,355
Marta. We've been talking it over, and...

775
00:49:14,962 --> 00:49:16,988
Have you been smoking grass?

776
00:49:16,988 --> 00:49:19,306
No. Come on.

777
00:49:19,641 --> 00:49:21,971
Marta, we've been talking it over,

778
00:49:21,971 --> 00:49:25,989
the whole family,
we'd like to take care of you.

779
00:49:27,612 --> 00:49:28,859
What does that mean?

780
00:49:29,830 --> 00:49:31,723
We all think
that you deserve something.

781
00:49:31,723 --> 00:49:34,280
Financially, we'd like to help you out.

782
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:36,492
You were never anything
but good to dad.

783
00:49:37,590 --> 00:49:41,444
Because of that
you can count on us.

784
00:49:46,076 --> 00:49:50,563
I thought you should've been
at the funeral, by the way. I was outvoted.

785
00:50:01,586 --> 00:50:05,236
Detective, you're still here?

786
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:13,164
Did you know Harlan?

787
00:50:13,357 --> 00:50:16,771
He knew my father,
who was a police detective, years ago.

788
00:50:18,939 --> 00:50:23,109
My father respected Harlan.
That says quite a lot.

789
00:50:23,532 --> 00:50:25,004
Is that why you're here?

790
00:50:26,303 --> 00:50:28,836
Here, now here? No.

791
00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:32,408
I stayed hoping to speak
to you a little more.

792
00:50:37,727 --> 00:50:40,839
Something is afoot
with this whole affair.

793
00:50:42,291 --> 00:50:45,658
I know it, and I believe
you know it too.

794
00:50:47,737 --> 00:50:49,516
So, you're gonna keep digging.

795
00:50:50,378 --> 00:50:56,869
Harlan's detectives, they dig,
they rifle and root, truffle pigs.

796
00:50:58,801 --> 00:51:02,688
I anticipate the terminus
of gravity's rainbow.

797
00:51:03,699 --> 00:51:05,450
Gravity's Rainbow?

798
00:51:05,450 --> 00:51:08,119
- It's a novel.
- Yeah, I know.

799
00:51:08,630 --> 00:51:10,993
- I haven't read it though.
- Neither have I.

800
00:51:10,993 --> 00:51:13,553
Nobody has. But I like the title.

801
00:51:14,507 --> 00:51:18,770
It describes the path of a projectile,
determined by natural law.

802
00:51:19,097 --> 00:51:20,901
I Voilà, my method.

803
00:51:21,585 --> 00:51:25,104
I observe the facts,
without biases of the head or heart.

804
00:51:25,620 --> 00:51:29,547
I determine the arc's path,
stroll leisurely to its terminus,

805
00:51:30,343 --> 00:51:32,689
and the truth falls at my feet.

806
00:51:35,698 --> 00:51:38,737
The medical examiner
was ready to rule this a suicide,

807
00:51:38,737 --> 00:51:42,078
but Elliott agreed
to keep it pending for 48 hours.

808
00:51:42,523 --> 00:51:46,574
Tomorrow morning I search the grounds
and the house, begin my investigation.

809
00:51:47,828 --> 00:51:50,061
I want you to be
by my side for it.

810
00:51:50,061 --> 00:51:50,648
What?

811
00:51:50,648 --> 00:51:52,530
My confidant, my eyes and ears.

812
00:51:52,530 --> 00:51:54,465
Wait, detective. Why me?

813
00:51:54,465 --> 00:51:56,836
I trust your kind heart.

814
00:51:58,816 --> 00:52:02,065
Also, you're the only one
who had nothing to gain from Harlan's death.

815
00:52:03,175 --> 00:52:05,097
So, how about it, Watson?

816
00:52:05,693 --> 00:52:09,278
Detective, if you want my insight
into this family.

817
00:52:10,548 --> 00:52:13,856
None of them are murderers.
That's my insight.

818
00:52:14,127 --> 00:52:17,690
And yet. Be it cruel or comforting,

819
00:52:18,392 --> 00:52:21,828
this machine unerringly
arrives at the truth.

820
00:52:22,864 --> 00:52:24,408
That's what it does.

821
00:52:25,810 --> 00:52:27,182
Always?

822
00:52:28,107 --> 00:52:29,870
Tomorrow at 8.

823
00:53:00,288 --> 00:53:03,380
I know I missed something,
there's gonna be something I missed.

824
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:05,416
- But I know you can beat it
- No, I can't...

825
00:53:05,416 --> 00:53:10,240
without losing your soul you have to do
what you have to do to beat this and win.

826
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:11,696
Harlan, I can't.

827
00:53:11,696 --> 00:53:13,826
You can and you have to.

828
00:53:15,075 --> 00:53:17,663
For me. Right now!

829
00:53:37,444 --> 00:53:39,307
Harlan, I have to get you help.

830
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:42,579
You do as I say

831
00:53:43,216 --> 00:53:46,194
- and everything will be just fine.
- God, no.

832
00:53:47,786 --> 00:53:49,873
I promise.

833
00:53:49,873 --> 00:53:51,873
Please...

834
00:55:00,182 --> 00:55:02,826
Fifty years ago I worked at this estate.

835
00:55:03,196 --> 00:55:09,565
You know, security back then was such
that you had to make the rounds with a 94

836
00:55:09,887 --> 00:55:12,142
and keeping your ears open.

837
00:55:12,695 --> 00:55:16,328
Now, you got all this
modern technology.

838
00:55:17,933 --> 00:55:22,082
That's the video there,
I saved the tape from that night.

839
00:55:22,255 --> 00:55:25,744
Normally, I erase 'em
with the magnetic de-gauser.

840
00:55:25,744 --> 00:55:28,795
But in this case I thought
I just save it, you know?

841
00:55:29,003 --> 00:55:33,252
For security. That's the live feed there.

842
00:55:34,758 --> 00:55:39,530
<i>To avoid the security cameras,
pull off the road after the carved elephant.</i>

843
00:55:39,530 --> 00:55:41,729
All right, well,
can we see the actual tape?

844
00:55:41,729 --> 00:55:43,494
Of course, you can.

845
00:55:43,702 --> 00:55:50,100
I recorded it SSLP.
There's 8 hours on that tape, 9 PM to 5 AM.

846
00:56:00,198 --> 00:56:02,099
Looks like a Japanese horror movie.

847
00:56:02,099 --> 00:56:04,374
You think we can scan forward on that?

848
00:56:05,481 --> 00:56:06,911
How can we scan forward?

849
00:56:07,107 --> 00:56:12,801
Just hold the play button down
and press FF until you hear it grind.

850
00:56:18,989 --> 00:56:22,496
All right, should be coming up now
at the time when the party ended.

851
00:56:25,601 --> 00:56:26,582
What happened?

852
00:56:26,582 --> 00:56:29,656
You gotta keep holding it down
or else it'll eject.

853
00:56:29,725 --> 00:56:31,975
That thing eats tapes like popcorn.

854
00:56:31,975 --> 00:56:35,392
You think your guys can digitize it,
so we can scan it properly?

855
00:56:35,392 --> 00:56:37,177
Yeah, I think we can do that.

856
00:56:37,745 --> 00:56:39,197
I got it.

857
00:56:41,458 --> 00:56:43,465
You know, all these statues
that you see around here,

858
00:56:43,617 --> 00:56:47,921
they are all straight out of his series
"The Menagerie Tragedy" trilogy, pretty cool.

859
00:56:48,083 --> 00:56:49,918
- Awesome.
- Yeah.

860
00:56:50,471 --> 00:56:52,664
Benny. It's beautiful out here.

861
00:56:52,664 --> 00:56:55,389
But do you really think someone
broken into the house and murdered Harlan?

862
00:56:55,389 --> 00:56:56,697
Is that why we're out here?

863
00:56:56,697 --> 00:57:00,456
It is unlikely, but if they did,
there will be traces.

864
00:57:00,876 --> 00:57:02,790
- I can take on that.
- Yeah.

865
00:57:11,417 --> 00:57:14,089
Hey Wagner, you got any luck on...

866
00:57:15,719 --> 00:57:16,847
- What's his name?
- Ransom?

867
00:57:16,847 --> 00:57:17,726
Yeah.

868
00:57:17,889 --> 00:57:19,129
No.

869
00:57:20,201 --> 00:57:24,633
Did get an address though.
10 Kenoak street.

870
00:57:25,525 --> 00:57:28,845
Ten Kenoak. Kenoak.

871
00:57:30,110 --> 00:57:32,282
It's a pleasant thing to say, isn't it?

872
00:57:32,654 --> 00:57:38,007
Kenoak. I awoke
amid Kenoak. That's funny.

873
00:57:38,007 --> 00:57:42,176
Always leaves and mud,
they really gonna do a number on my boots.

874
00:57:42,531 --> 00:57:45,107
Mud, has it rained the past week?

875
00:57:45,846 --> 00:57:47,607
- No. Stay there!
- What?

876
00:57:48,539 --> 00:57:50,862
Okay. We got footprints here.

877
00:57:50,862 --> 00:57:53,073
So, I wanna...

878
00:57:53,619 --> 00:57:56,312
- Marta, stop.
- What?

879
00:57:57,044 --> 00:57:57,693
What?

880
00:57:57,693 --> 00:57:59,481
- Marta, stay there.
- What?

881
00:57:59,481 --> 00:58:02,076
No, Marta, stay there, Marta! No!

882
00:58:02,678 --> 00:58:03,900
Did you call me?

883
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:05,475
Excuse me.

884
00:58:05,475 --> 00:58:07,831
Wagner, we gonna need to call the boys,
so they come down here

885
00:58:07,831 --> 00:58:10,168
and take a look at
all these tracks, get it taped off.

886
00:58:10,168 --> 00:58:11,946
- Stay on that side.
- I'm sorry.

887
00:58:14,714 --> 00:58:16,114
Hey.

888
00:58:19,881 --> 00:58:24,332
Best judge of character is a dog.
I found that to be true.

889
00:58:33,539 --> 00:58:35,964
They've got plans
to read the will at around 10.

890
00:58:37,005 --> 00:58:38,847
The whole family will be here soon.

891
00:58:41,417 --> 00:58:43,206
I've never been to a will reading.

892
00:58:44,458 --> 00:58:46,454
You think it'll be like a game show.

893
00:58:47,076 --> 00:58:51,190
Think of a community theater
production of a tax return.

894
00:58:52,639 --> 00:58:54,501
So, what are we looking for?

895
00:58:54,501 --> 00:58:58,416
Oh, you know, anything suspicious
or out of the ordinary.

896
00:58:59,023 --> 00:59:00,698
You'll know it when you see it.

897
00:59:01,526 --> 00:59:02,989
Oh my God!

898
00:59:03,675 --> 00:59:05,504
Sweet beans!

899
00:59:09,340 --> 00:59:13,007
Well, good morning, Mrs. Thrombey.

900
00:59:22,109 --> 00:59:24,152
You think you could
handle the study?

901
00:59:33,829 --> 00:59:35,918
Where's your medical bag?

902
00:59:36,202 --> 00:59:40,153
I don't know. I left it here.
I always leave it here with Harlan at night.

903
00:59:40,153 --> 00:59:42,986
They must've taken it in
as evidence. I'll look into that.

904
00:59:48,822 --> 00:59:50,234
Shit.

905
00:59:52,600 --> 00:59:55,095
How'd the GO board get knocked over?

906
00:59:55,282 --> 00:59:57,155
We were just goofing around.

907
00:59:58,762 --> 01:00:00,453
What are you thinking?

908
01:00:14,994 --> 01:00:17,307
No, no, no.
Hey, hey, hey!

909
01:00:17,870 --> 01:00:19,428
Let me guess.

910
01:00:19,428 --> 01:00:21,422
Hey. Stop. Stop.

911
01:00:22,343 --> 01:00:23,521
Stop. Stop.

912
01:00:24,194 --> 01:00:25,729
Hugh Drysdale?

913
01:00:26,551 --> 01:00:29,295
Ransom. Call me Ransom.
It's my middle name.

914
01:00:29,432 --> 01:00:31,035
Only the help call me Hugh.

915
01:00:31,951 --> 01:00:36,020
Okay, this is Trooper Wagner,
I'm Lieutenant Elliott.

916
01:00:36,699 --> 01:00:38,470
We just wanna ask
a few questions.

917
01:00:42,569 --> 01:00:45,088
Excuse me. Sir?

918
01:00:46,009 --> 01:00:47,648
We're officers of the law.

919
01:00:47,648 --> 01:00:50,734
You gonna run me in? I don't feel
like talking. I'm distraught.

920
01:00:51,287 --> 01:00:53,569
Hey Benny, you wanna ask
this guy some questions?

921
01:00:53,569 --> 01:00:55,120
All right, what is this?
What's this arrangement?

922
01:00:55,120 --> 01:00:56,583
Mr. Drysdale.

923
01:00:56,893 --> 01:00:59,055
CSI KFC?

924
01:01:03,945 --> 01:01:06,504
Hey Frannie, how about a glass
of cold milk?

925
01:01:06,852 --> 01:01:10,029
Hey asshole.
Not her name, Not her job.

926
01:01:10,354 --> 01:01:12,962
Hey Meg. How's your
SJW degree coming?

927
01:01:13,431 --> 01:01:15,937
- Trust fund prick.
- All right. Guys.

928
01:01:18,152 --> 01:01:19,660
Hey, everyone.

929
01:01:19,992 --> 01:01:24,291
I'm just gonna be in the other room,
setting up, be ready in 10 minutes.

930
01:01:30,038 --> 01:01:33,983
Funny, Ransom, you skipped the funeral,
but you're early for the will reading.

931
01:01:35,689 --> 01:01:38,729
Okay, people grieve
in different ways, let's not...

932
01:01:38,729 --> 01:01:40,371
You know what?
It's funny you're here at all.

933
01:01:40,371 --> 01:01:43,228
Why are you even bothering?
That's what I'm asking myself.

934
01:01:43,629 --> 01:01:44,996
What's that supposed to mean?

935
01:01:44,996 --> 01:01:48,031
- He knows what it supposed to mean.
- Wait. Walt. What?

936
01:01:50,610 --> 01:01:53,871
Jacob was in that bathroom
in the night of the party.

937
01:01:55,354 --> 01:01:57,311
Oh, that's where
you were all night?

938
01:01:57,311 --> 01:01:59,744
The hell were you doing in the
bathroom all night?

939
01:01:59,744 --> 01:02:01,785
- Nothing.
- Swatting Syrian refugees?

940
01:02:01,785 --> 01:02:03,718
- No. I was not.
- Alt right troll.

941
01:02:03,718 --> 01:02:05,006
Liberal snowflake.

942
01:02:05,006 --> 01:02:06,647
I don't know
what any of that means.

943
01:02:06,647 --> 01:02:08,466
It means your son's
a little creep.

944
01:02:08,466 --> 01:02:11,114
Oh, my son's a creep?

945
01:02:11,114 --> 01:02:12,715
Guys! Just...

946
01:02:12,715 --> 01:02:14,388
Walt, he was in the bathroom.

947
01:02:14,388 --> 01:02:15,730
Yeah, he was in the bathroom,

948
01:02:15,730 --> 01:02:18,730
joylessly masturbating
to pictures of dead deer.

949
01:02:19,814 --> 01:02:22,030
You know what, Richard?
You wanna go?

950
01:02:22,030 --> 01:02:23,728
You bet, Skippy. Let's go!

951
01:02:23,878 --> 01:02:25,148
You wanna go? C'mon!

952
01:02:25,319 --> 01:02:26,615
You better watch out!

953
01:02:26,615 --> 01:02:27,880
Stop!

954
01:02:29,417 --> 01:02:31,945
C'mon, you had me
waiting for it my whole life!

955
01:02:31,945 --> 01:02:33,648
Stop it right now!

956
01:02:33,648 --> 01:02:35,859
I can handle myself!
I can handle it.

957
01:02:35,859 --> 01:02:37,349
Oh my God!

958
01:02:37,542 --> 01:02:39,381
We gotta do this more often.

959
01:02:39,381 --> 01:02:40,941
Hey!

960
01:02:41,108 --> 01:02:43,740
Jacob, we know
where this is going.

961
01:02:44,033 --> 01:02:46,098
You were in the bathroom
next to Harlan's office,

962
01:02:46,098 --> 01:02:47,797
where he had the fight
with Ransom.

963
01:02:47,952 --> 01:02:50,325
Now, you heard something. Spill it.

964
01:02:52,595 --> 01:02:54,343
I just heard two things.

965
01:02:58,005 --> 01:02:59,289
...my will!

966
01:02:59,458 --> 01:03:01,046
My will.

967
01:03:01,233 --> 01:03:03,647
And then there was more yelling,

968
01:03:04,915 --> 01:03:09,419
and then I heard
Ransom say "I'm warning you."

969
01:03:13,319 --> 01:03:16,071
Ransom? What's that mean?

970
01:03:16,426 --> 01:03:18,929
I think that means our father
finally came to his senses

971
01:03:18,929 --> 01:03:21,851
and cut this worthless little brat
out of his will.

972
01:03:22,642 --> 01:03:24,944
So, I guess you gonna have to
sell the Beamer,

973
01:03:24,944 --> 01:03:26,887
and give your notice
at the country club,

974
01:03:26,887 --> 01:03:29,331
and kick whatever fashion drugs
you're on.

975
01:03:29,497 --> 01:03:32,799
Because if you think that after
all the bridges you burned,

976
01:03:32,799 --> 01:03:35,588
After all the shit you said,
after everything that you put

977
01:03:35,588 --> 01:03:37,706
this family through
for the last 10 years,

978
01:03:37,706 --> 01:03:40,362
that any of us
are gonna support you,

979
01:03:40,362 --> 01:03:42,316
that any of us
are gonna give you,

980
01:03:42,316 --> 01:03:48,429
like dad liked to say,
a single red dime, you're nuts!

981
01:03:52,232 --> 01:03:53,462
Son.

982
01:03:54,473 --> 01:03:55,646
Father?

983
01:03:56,434 --> 01:03:59,780
Did Harlan tell you he was
gonna cut you out of the will?

984
01:04:01,669 --> 01:04:02,979
Yup.

985
01:04:05,907 --> 01:04:10,553
Well, then he's done what
none of us were strong enough to do.

986
01:04:11,949 --> 01:04:14,513
Maybe this might finally
make you grow up.

987
01:04:16,900 --> 01:04:20,250
This might be the best thing
that could ever happen to you.

988
01:04:20,463 --> 01:04:22,788
Thank you. My mother,
ladies and gentlemen.

989
01:04:22,971 --> 01:04:26,726
Look, this is not gonna be easy
for you, but it'll be good.

990
01:04:27,305 --> 01:04:29,275
Nothing good is ever easy.

991
01:04:29,617 --> 01:04:30,735
Up your ass, Joni.

992
01:04:30,735 --> 01:04:33,121
You've got your teeth in this family's
tit for a long time.

993
01:04:33,121 --> 01:04:35,194
Up your ass? Very nice.

994
01:04:35,194 --> 01:04:38,087
Matter of fact -
eat shit, hows that?

995
01:04:38,899 --> 01:04:42,200
In fact, eat shit,
eat shit, eat shit.

996
01:04:42,200 --> 01:04:45,038
- You entitled prick!
- I would snap that smug smile...

997
01:04:45,038 --> 01:04:47,562
Definitely eat shit. Eat shit.

998
01:04:52,121 --> 01:04:53,576
I own it, shit!

999
01:04:55,162 --> 01:04:57,718
What was that about
will readings being boring?

1000
01:04:58,532 --> 01:05:00,721
Exception that proves the rule.

1001
01:05:03,244 --> 01:05:04,742
Asshole.

1002
01:05:05,509 --> 01:05:09,879
I'm warning you.
Ransom said "I'm warning you."

1003
01:05:10,225 --> 01:05:12,960
You heard Ransom in there,
that's the kind of thing he says.

1004
01:05:13,756 --> 01:05:15,562
You want this? You want this?

1005
01:05:20,049 --> 01:05:22,349
What do we have here?

1006
01:05:27,782 --> 01:05:31,190
This looks like
a relatively fresh break.

1007
01:05:31,469 --> 01:05:33,344
Yup. Right there.

1008
01:05:33,985 --> 01:05:34,997
Wait a minute.

1009
01:05:35,303 --> 01:05:39,452
That doesn't make sense.
Where's that window?

1010
01:05:40,119 --> 01:05:43,827
How about some more cookies, you?
You want some more cookies?

1011
01:05:45,355 --> 01:05:49,550
Hey, maybe Harlem left you
a cold glass of milk in his will, asshole!

1012
01:05:51,831 --> 01:05:53,874
Show me, but stay off the carpet.

1013
01:06:08,827 --> 01:06:12,416
It's the trick window!
From "A Kill For All Seasons!"

1014
01:06:12,519 --> 01:06:14,342
Trooper, here, will you take this?

1015
01:06:26,733 --> 01:06:29,150
Traces of dried mud.

1016
01:06:29,674 --> 01:06:32,505
I suspect they go
the length of the hallway.

1017
01:06:33,668 --> 01:06:34,862
Footprints?

1018
01:06:34,862 --> 01:06:36,708
No, just traces.

1019
01:06:36,887 --> 01:06:39,509
Depending on when this thing
was last cleaned,

1020
01:06:39,879 --> 01:06:42,631
this could've happened
at anytime, right?

1021
01:06:42,674 --> 01:06:45,839
No, that would not explain this.

1022
01:06:46,579 --> 01:06:49,741
Analyze that mud.
It will match these traces.

1023
01:06:50,286 --> 01:06:54,474
And you will find similar samples,
leading up the trellis on the outside of the house.

1024
01:06:55,328 --> 01:06:59,384
On the night of the party, somebody
who did not want to be heard climbing those steps

1025
01:06:59,543 --> 01:07:03,500
went to a great deal of trouble
to break into Harlan Thrombey's rooms.

1026
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:07,071
The game is afoot, eh Watson?

1027
01:07:17,914 --> 01:07:20,806
Well. Thank you all for
getting together like this,

1028
01:07:20,806 --> 01:07:24,378
it isn't legally necessary,
but I thought because you're all in town

1029
01:07:24,378 --> 01:07:26,047
and some of you are leaving soon...

1030
01:07:26,047 --> 01:07:28,802
Excuse me, I'm sorry.

1031
01:07:29,769 --> 01:07:34,823
Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to
gently request that you all stay in town

1032
01:07:34,982 --> 01:07:36,901
until the investigation is completed.

1033
01:07:36,901 --> 01:07:40,351
He's gently requesting,
but we gotta make that an order.

1034
01:07:40,523 --> 01:07:42,266
No one move
until we figure this all out.

1035
01:07:42,697 --> 01:07:44,628
- What?
- Can we ask why?

1036
01:07:44,628 --> 01:07:46,066
- Has something changed?
- No.

1037
01:07:46,066 --> 01:07:48,169
No it hasn't changed
or no we can't ask?

1038
01:07:48,169 --> 01:07:51,200
Mr. Stevens, you may continue.

1039
01:07:51,627 --> 01:07:57,042
Right. Well the other reason I thought
this gathering would be beneficial

1040
01:07:57,214 --> 01:08:02,622
is because Harlan altered
his will a week before he died.

1041
01:08:02,622 --> 01:08:08,336
He sealed, he asked me not to submit
it to the courts for probate until after his death.

1042
01:08:08,884 --> 01:08:13,030
If anyone is confused about anything,
we're all together, we can talk.

1043
01:08:13,522 --> 01:08:17,163
Although, I don't imagine any of it
is going to be that complicated.

1044
01:08:17,768 --> 01:08:19,623
Harlan's assets included

1045
01:08:20,646 --> 01:08:22,099
- The house.
- The house,

1046
01:08:22,099 --> 01:08:23,643
which he owned outright.

1047
01:08:24,891 --> 01:08:26,460
- Sixty million.
- Yes.

1048
01:08:26,460 --> 01:08:30,113
Sixty million in various
cash accounts and investments.

1049
01:08:30,277 --> 01:08:33,636
And, of course, the real asset -

1050
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:37,800
sole ownership of Blood Like Wine,
his publishing company.

1051
01:08:37,800 --> 01:08:43,098
He also wrote up a statement when he was making
the changes and he wanted that read first.

1052
01:08:45,786 --> 01:08:48,377
"Dearest Linda, Walter, and Joni.

1053
01:08:48,569 --> 01:08:51,348
Some of you may be surprised
by the choice I've made here.

1054
01:08:51,348 --> 01:08:53,933
No pleasure was taken
in the exclusion,

1055
01:08:53,933 --> 01:08:58,660
and its purpose was not to sow
greater discord in the family, quite the opposite.

1056
01:08:59,119 --> 01:09:02,910
Please accept it with grace
and without bitterness. But do accept it.

1057
01:09:03,223 --> 01:09:05,503
It's for the best, Dad."

1058
01:09:19,025 --> 01:09:21,611
Wow, well, yeah.
Not too complex at all.

1059
01:09:22,671 --> 01:09:23,879
This'll be quick.

1060
01:09:24,853 --> 01:09:30,034
I, Harlan Thrombey, being of sound mind
and body, yada yada...

1061
01:09:31,274 --> 01:09:35,335
I hereby direct that all my assets,
both liquid and otherwise,

1062
01:09:35,493 --> 01:09:39,261
I leave in their entirety
to Marta Cabrera.

1063
01:09:40,756 --> 01:09:43,491
My entire ownership
of Blood Like Wine publishing

1064
01:09:43,620 --> 01:09:46,488
I leave in its entirety to Marta Cabrera.

1065
01:09:46,661 --> 01:09:51,681
The copyright of its catalog likewise
I leave in its entirety to Marta Cabrera."

1066
01:09:55,771 --> 01:09:57,058
What?

1067
01:10:01,807 --> 01:10:04,555
No. That's not...

1068
01:10:04,736 --> 01:10:05,924
No.

1069
01:10:05,924 --> 01:10:08,171
That can't be.
Can I see that please, Alan?

1070
01:10:08,171 --> 01:10:09,470
- That's right.
- Please.

1071
01:10:09,470 --> 01:10:10,616
This can't be legal.

1072
01:10:11,240 --> 01:10:12,499
It's right.

1073
01:10:12,568 --> 01:10:14,030
- You know, he's been...
- Oh my God!

1074
01:10:15,300 --> 01:10:16,303
Alan, it's a mistake.

1075
01:10:16,303 --> 01:10:18,555
I don't know what to say,
we're his family, so...

1076
01:10:19,107 --> 01:10:20,602
It's not possible!

1077
01:10:20,662 --> 01:10:22,644
Are there safeguards against this?

1078
01:10:25,835 --> 01:10:26,790
Harlan was...

1079
01:10:26,790 --> 01:10:29,619
In his final days
he was under weight of medication.

1080
01:10:29,769 --> 01:10:31,827
Obviously, he wasn't...
I mean... I don't know...

1081
01:10:32,815 --> 01:10:38,759
Alan, you can take this piece of paper
and shove it right up your ass and get out.

1082
01:10:38,932 --> 01:10:40,985
And you cops too.
Out! Out!

1083
01:10:41,276 --> 01:10:42,393
- Right now!
- Melinda.

1084
01:10:42,393 --> 01:10:46,096
No, Richard, we need to talk,
we need to fight this thing.

1085
01:10:46,096 --> 01:10:48,693
We're not going anywhere.
I said get out!

1086
01:10:49,379 --> 01:10:54,058
We're the Thrombeys goddammit!
This is still our house!

1087
01:11:01,641 --> 01:11:02,569
Sorry.

1088
01:11:02,866 --> 01:11:05,514
"Likewise the house at 2 Deerborn Drive

1089
01:11:05,514 --> 01:11:08,666
and all belongings therein
I leave to Marta Cabrera."

1090
01:11:10,949 --> 01:11:13,194
You little bitch!

1091
01:11:13,362 --> 01:11:15,964
You little bitch!

1092
01:11:16,097 --> 01:11:19,126
Did you know about this?
Were you in this from the beginning?

1093
01:11:19,126 --> 01:11:20,530
No, no, no!
I just wanna know!

1094
01:11:20,947 --> 01:11:23,580
What were you doing?
Were you boinking my father?

1095
01:11:23,580 --> 01:11:24,519
"Boinking?"

1096
01:11:25,410 --> 01:11:27,356
I think everybody just needs to cool...

1097
01:11:27,356 --> 01:11:30,337
You had sex with my grandpa.
You dirty anchor baby.

1098
01:11:30,983 --> 01:11:33,324
In the meantime I'd maybe run.

1099
01:11:34,154 --> 01:11:35,183
Marta.

1100
01:11:35,549 --> 01:11:37,067
- Ladies and gentlemen.
- Talk to us.

1101
01:11:37,672 --> 01:11:40,021
Marta, wait a minute.

1102
01:11:40,170 --> 01:11:42,124
I totally understand
how you must be feeling.

1103
01:11:42,124 --> 01:11:42,991
You can talk to me.

1104
01:11:42,991 --> 01:11:44,441
I don't know how this...

1105
01:11:45,204 --> 01:11:46,589
I don't know.

1106
01:11:50,229 --> 01:11:53,270
I don't know what's happening.
I don't know why he...

1107
01:11:53,379 --> 01:11:56,205
Guys, I'm also confused,
I need to think.

1108
01:11:56,205 --> 01:11:57,954
Marta! You listen...

1109
01:11:58,384 --> 01:11:59,638
I can't catch up!

1110
01:12:04,533 --> 01:12:06,338
I can't open the damn...

1111
01:12:08,368 --> 01:12:11,880
Marta, you have to understand.
He is our father.

1112
01:12:12,347 --> 01:12:14,929
Marta, don't listen to them. I'm here.

1113
01:12:15,108 --> 01:12:16,884
I'm not on Twitter anymore.

1114
01:12:17,810 --> 01:12:21,386
So, de-add me on Instagram, okay?
I wanna talk to you.

1115
01:12:28,347 --> 01:12:29,415
What's going on?

1116
01:12:29,415 --> 01:12:32,120
I think this could be the best thing
to happen to all of you!

1117
01:12:34,289 --> 01:12:35,949
What does he mean by that?

1118
01:12:37,403 --> 01:12:39,187
Richard, why didn't you stop he?

1119
01:12:39,256 --> 01:12:42,117
What was I supposed to do?
Grab the bumper with my teeth?

1120
01:12:52,394 --> 01:12:54,361
Okay, seriously though, what the hell?

1121
01:12:59,488 --> 01:13:01,198
Hey, can we take an extra bowl?

1122
01:13:01,198 --> 01:13:02,586
Sure.

1123
01:13:09,280 --> 01:13:12,205
You look like you're gonna pass out.
Have you eaten anything today?

1124
01:13:12,205 --> 01:13:13,506
Eat.

1125
01:13:17,511 --> 01:13:18,828
This is a nightmare.

1126
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:22,529
So why?

1127
01:13:23,868 --> 01:13:25,816
- Why?
- Why?

1128
01:13:27,081 --> 01:13:30,117
Hey, this is everything.

1129
01:13:31,239 --> 01:13:33,200
There gotta be a bigger reason why
and you know it.

1130
01:13:33,200 --> 01:13:35,767
Well, how about it had to do more
with you guys than with me.

1131
01:13:37,865 --> 01:13:39,200
Yeah.

1132
01:13:39,951 --> 01:13:41,891
Yeah, it's the only thing
that makes sense.

1133
01:13:47,220 --> 01:13:48,818
Did he tell you anything?

1134
01:13:48,818 --> 01:13:50,554
Only that I wasn't getting a cent.

1135
01:13:50,554 --> 01:13:52,652
That's because he wanted you to build
something from the ground...

1136
01:13:52,652 --> 01:13:54,327
"Build something
from the ground up", yeah.

1137
01:13:54,327 --> 01:13:55,961
My mother built her business
from the ground up

1138
01:13:55,961 --> 01:13:58,539
with a million dollar loan
from my grandfather.

1139
01:13:58,685 --> 01:14:01,623
My father owns none of it,
she made him sign a prenup.

1140
01:14:01,667 --> 01:14:02,915
He lives in fear.

1141
01:14:03,421 --> 01:14:06,576
And I know that's what grandfather
was trying to protect me from by doing this,

1142
01:14:06,576 --> 01:14:10,223
And I know I shouldn't say this
out loud, but when he told me, I...

1143
01:14:11,972 --> 01:14:14,605
Jesus, I coulda killed him.

1144
01:14:17,198 --> 01:14:19,827
After I left the party, though,
I was driving

1145
01:14:20,372 --> 01:14:23,598
nowhere, just in the night,
and I had this...

1146
01:14:25,804 --> 01:14:27,261
clarity.

1147
01:14:27,745 --> 01:14:30,860
Like from here on out
I was gonna have to fend for myself.

1148
01:14:31,661 --> 01:14:33,281
And that felt...

1149
01:14:34,341 --> 01:14:35,638
Good.

1150
01:14:36,870 --> 01:14:38,508
The old bastard.

1151
01:14:41,508 --> 01:14:47,318
Marta I know three things.
One: I know he didn't commit suicide.

1152
01:14:49,448 --> 01:14:50,422
What makes you think that?

1153
01:14:50,422 --> 01:14:52,932
I don't think it. I know it.

1154
01:14:53,606 --> 01:14:55,233
Because I knew my granddad.

1155
01:14:55,233 --> 01:14:57,100
Maybe you and I
are the only two who knew him,

1156
01:14:57,100 --> 01:14:59,769
so you're not gonna bullshit
me on this, because two:

1157
01:15:00,768 --> 01:15:02,718
I know lying makes you puke.

1158
01:15:03,203 --> 01:15:05,752
'Cause of that mafia game
last 4th of July.

1159
01:15:07,095 --> 01:15:08,553
And three:

1160
01:15:10,176 --> 01:15:13,333
I know that you just ate a full plate
of baked beans and sausage.

1161
01:15:15,984 --> 01:15:17,415
So.

1162
01:15:19,044 --> 01:15:21,055
Look me in the eye

1163
01:15:21,737 --> 01:15:24,376
and tell me what
happened to my grandfather.

1164
01:15:27,306 --> 01:15:29,212
- You asshole.
- Marta.

1165
01:15:30,218 --> 01:15:32,562
Tell me everything.

1166
01:15:35,710 --> 01:15:37,590
Alan, there have got
to be options here.

1167
01:15:37,590 --> 01:15:40,032
No. I don't know how many times

1168
01:15:40,032 --> 01:15:43,324
I can repeat the same
two pieces of information.

1169
01:15:43,324 --> 01:15:46,718
If Harlan was of sound mind
when he made the changes,

1170
01:15:46,718 --> 01:15:48,312
and we've all confirmed he was.

1171
01:15:48,312 --> 01:15:51,020
Would a sound mind
do this! How? Sound how?

1172
01:15:51,020 --> 01:15:53,483
The very action
speaks to unsoundness!

1173
01:15:53,615 --> 01:15:55,044
Not legally, no.

1174
01:15:55,682 --> 01:15:59,515
You, not liking what he did
does not speak to testamentary capacity.

1175
01:15:59,515 --> 01:16:02,214
What about undue influence?

1176
01:16:02,214 --> 01:16:04,589
Yes! Undue influence!
How about that?

1177
01:16:05,108 --> 01:16:06,077
Did you just Google that?

1178
01:16:06,077 --> 01:16:09,111
Look, if Marta was manipulating
dad somehow, and if...

1179
01:16:09,111 --> 01:16:11,598
If somehow she had gotten
her hooks into him.

1180
01:16:11,598 --> 01:16:13,996
You need a strong case for that.

1181
01:16:14,439 --> 01:16:16,870
Your honor, "She endeared herself to him

1182
01:16:16,870 --> 01:16:19,119
through hard work and good humor."

1183
01:16:19,285 --> 01:16:21,384
That won't cut the salami.

1184
01:16:21,524 --> 01:16:23,167
What about the slayer rule?

1185
01:16:23,953 --> 01:16:25,298
I did just Google that.

1186
01:16:25,669 --> 01:16:27,588
The slayer rule obviously
doesn't apply here.

1187
01:16:28,792 --> 01:16:30,363
What the hell is the slayer rule?

1188
01:16:30,363 --> 01:16:34,501
It's if someone is convicted of killing
the person, they don't get their inheritance.

1189
01:16:34,501 --> 01:16:38,416
Not even convicted, even if they're
held responsible for their death in civil court.

1190
01:16:38,918 --> 01:16:40,392
Like OJ.

1191
01:16:40,707 --> 01:16:46,320
Yes, Like OJ.
But Harlan committed suicide.

1192
01:16:54,903 --> 01:16:56,630
Detective Blank.

1193
01:16:56,630 --> 01:16:59,853
You said that the investigation is ongoing,
you made a point of that.

1194
01:17:00,151 --> 01:17:01,629
Do you suspect foul play?

1195
01:17:01,629 --> 01:17:04,756
Mister Blanc. If you please.

1196
01:17:06,129 --> 01:17:12,686
There is much that remains unclear.
But yes. I suspect foul play.

1197
01:17:14,371 --> 01:17:15,465
Marta?

1198
01:17:15,663 --> 01:17:18,139
I have eliminated no suspects.

1199
01:17:20,217 --> 01:17:23,505
You're full of shit, I don't trust
this guy in the tweed suit,

1200
01:17:23,808 --> 01:17:26,194
and Alan, God bless you,
you're useless.

1201
01:17:26,735 --> 01:17:27,864
Thank you.

1202
01:17:27,864 --> 01:17:30,995
There's only one answer to this:
she has to renounce the inheritance.

1203
01:17:30,995 --> 01:17:31,971
She knows that's what
she should do...

1204
01:17:31,971 --> 01:17:33,994
That's exactly what she'll do.

1205
01:17:36,224 --> 01:17:37,601
- Mom.
- She'll do it.

1206
01:17:37,973 --> 01:17:40,857
If Granddad wanted to give Marta
everything, then that's what he wanted.

1207
01:17:40,857 --> 01:17:44,310
No, this wasn't him.
He loved us.

1208
01:17:44,454 --> 01:17:48,069
He wanted us taken care of.
He wanted you to have an education.

1209
01:17:48,549 --> 01:17:52,185
Meg, you think I can pay
for your school?

1210
01:18:02,930 --> 01:18:06,447
I know, just saying it it
sounds insane, but it's all true.

1211
01:18:06,582 --> 01:18:09,087
And I think Blanc's been on to me
from the start.

1212
01:18:09,247 --> 01:18:11,653
I don't care if I go to jail,
but my mom...

1213
01:18:12,191 --> 01:18:14,749
My sister, we...

1214
01:18:17,313 --> 01:18:19,142
Are you gonna say something?

1215
01:18:20,387 --> 01:18:23,540
I always thought I was the only one
that could beat him at GO.

1216
01:18:24,430 --> 01:18:26,431
I always thought
that meant something.

1217
01:18:26,781 --> 01:18:28,743
Yeah, I know you did.

1218
01:18:28,743 --> 01:18:33,283
In the night of the party, my last
conversation with him, our last argument.

1219
01:18:33,283 --> 01:18:35,159
that's what he told me about you.

1220
01:18:36,205 --> 01:18:38,710
That you beat him in GO
more than I do, and I thought...

1221
01:18:41,204 --> 01:18:43,385
What a strange thing to tell me.

1222
01:18:45,521 --> 01:18:47,137
I think I get it now.

1223
01:18:49,261 --> 01:18:51,305
It did mean something.

1224
01:18:56,746 --> 01:18:58,588
I'm not gonna tell my family shit.

1225
01:18:58,736 --> 01:19:01,767
You're not going to jail.
That detective is not gonna catch you.

1226
01:19:02,873 --> 01:19:04,994
And you're not gonna
give up the money.

1227
01:19:05,234 --> 01:19:08,393
This is was granddad wanted for you and me,
think about what he did to go through with this.

1228
01:19:08,393 --> 01:19:11,059
He wanted this for himself,
he wanted this for the family.

1229
01:19:12,066 --> 01:19:13,770
And he wanted it for you.

1230
01:19:13,770 --> 01:19:18,011
You've come this far.
Let me help you go all the way.

1231
01:19:18,179 --> 01:19:19,959
What's going on? This isn't you.

1232
01:19:20,513 --> 01:19:24,866
You could just turn me in right now
and still get your cut of the inheritance. Why?

1233
01:19:25,415 --> 01:19:27,355
Because fuck my family.

1234
01:19:28,715 --> 01:19:31,542
I can help you get away
with this, and then...

1235
01:19:32,522 --> 01:19:35,037
You're gonna give me
my cut of the inheritance.

1236
01:19:36,511 --> 01:19:40,537
Happy ending. Everybody wins:
you, me, Harlan.

1237
01:19:40,537 --> 01:19:42,193
Yeah.

1238
01:19:42,918 --> 01:19:45,114
Deal?

1239
01:19:56,530 --> 01:19:58,024
- Meg.
- Marta.

1240
01:19:59,220 --> 01:20:01,723
- That was nuts.
- I know.

1241
01:20:02,111 --> 01:20:03,338
Are you okay?

1242
01:20:04,835 --> 01:20:06,941
Yeah. Are you?

1243
01:20:06,941 --> 01:20:08,345
Yeah, I'm fine.

1244
01:20:09,984 --> 01:20:12,027
Look, no one knows
I'm calling you, I just...

1245
01:20:12,224 --> 01:20:13,668
I wanted to...

1246
01:20:16,188 --> 01:20:18,934
I wanted to say sorry
for how everyone was.

1247
01:20:20,244 --> 01:20:25,744
And... I guess I wanted to ask...
What are you gonna do?

1248
01:20:28,646 --> 01:20:30,168
What do you mean?

1249
01:20:30,168 --> 01:20:33,734
Well, the... with the will.
What are you gonna to do?

1250
01:20:36,421 --> 01:20:38,326
What do you think I should do?

1251
01:20:38,895 --> 01:20:43,510
You should do
whatever you think is right.

1252
01:20:46,172 --> 01:20:47,927
Look, I...

1253
01:20:49,544 --> 01:20:51,914
I think you should
give it back to us.

1254
01:20:53,709 --> 01:20:56,950
Granddad always took
care of us, we're his family.

1255
01:20:57,735 --> 01:21:01,338
I know he was like family to you,
but we're his actual family.

1256
01:21:01,484 --> 01:21:02,569
Yeah.

1257
01:21:03,578 --> 01:21:08,381
Marta, you know this isn't fair,
we've always been good to you,

1258
01:21:08,381 --> 01:21:11,235
and you're like family
and we'll take care of you, but...

1259
01:21:11,630 --> 01:21:15,734
You have to make things right.
You know what's right.

1260
01:21:16,587 --> 01:21:17,940
Marta.

1261
01:21:20,474 --> 01:21:24,468
Mom's broke, she says
I'm gonna have to drop out of school.

1262
01:21:24,468 --> 01:21:26,153
No, no, Meg.

1263
01:21:27,761 --> 01:21:29,550
Listen, I won't let that happen.

1264
01:21:29,722 --> 01:21:33,152
Whatever money you need,
I'll give it to you. I'm here for you.

1265
01:21:33,152 --> 01:21:34,977
And I want you to know
I'm gonna take care of you.

1266
01:21:34,977 --> 01:21:38,635
- I promise that, okay?
- Thanks.

1267
01:21:39,187 --> 01:21:40,748
And once I...

1268
01:21:59,765 --> 01:22:01,312
Okay then.

1269
01:22:01,805 --> 01:22:04,518
Did Blanc find anything
suspicious at the house?

1270
01:22:06,750 --> 01:22:11,274
Yes, he found mud, upstairs,
where I broke in through the window.

1271
01:22:12,009 --> 01:22:13,600
Identifiable prints?

1272
01:22:13,987 --> 01:22:16,548
- No.
- Good, okay.

1273
01:22:17,319 --> 01:22:19,158
Good. Hey.

1274
01:22:19,158 --> 01:22:23,333
You lay low for a coupe of days.
Wait for this investigation to blow over, and it will.

1275
01:22:23,333 --> 01:22:27,206
'Cause no matter how good that Blanc guy
thinks he is, he's got nothing.

1276
01:22:27,378 --> 01:22:29,881
Hey, Relax.

1277
01:22:31,800 --> 01:22:35,364
Marta get your ass up, what the hell is happening?
There's a guy here and a bunch of stuff.

1278
01:22:35,364 --> 01:22:37,491
Everything's going crazy.
Are we rich?

1279
01:22:38,879 --> 01:22:40,760
Maybe, Alice, I don't know.

1280
01:22:40,760 --> 01:22:43,650
I don't even know what that means
but you better get your ass up.

1281
01:22:44,433 --> 01:22:47,970
We don't know much about Marta Cabrera
or her exact relationship...

1282
01:22:47,970 --> 01:22:51,482
Oh my God Marta.
What is all this. What did you do?

1283
01:22:52,244 --> 01:22:54,496
- Is that here?
- Oh, yeah it is.

1284
01:22:55,641 --> 01:22:58,592
Wait, so is that true?
Are we rich?

1285
01:23:01,809 --> 01:23:03,191
Oh my God.

1286
01:23:17,291 --> 01:23:19,611
Good Morning, Mrs. Thrombey.

1287
01:23:24,734 --> 01:23:27,851
Why is grief the providence of youth?

1288
01:23:29,204 --> 01:23:30,777
I don't know.

1289
01:23:32,507 --> 01:23:37,215
But I'd imagine that
age deepens all feelings.

1290
01:23:38,621 --> 01:23:40,749
Including grief.

1291
01:23:43,056 --> 01:23:50,134
This was a long walk to offering
condolences for the loss of your son.

1292
01:23:51,242 --> 01:23:57,153
And asking you if it isn't presumptuous
of me not to think too harshly of your family.

1293
01:23:58,264 --> 01:24:02,988
if I am, as I suspect,
the first to console you.

1294
01:24:04,245 --> 01:24:07,127
They're young, aren't they?

1295
01:24:12,079 --> 01:24:17,575
One thing I assume of age
is weariness.

1296
01:24:18,145 --> 01:24:20,955
Damned if I don't get
more tired every day.

1297
01:24:21,490 --> 01:24:26,455
Tired of what I do.
Following arcs, like lobbed rocks.

1298
01:24:26,632 --> 01:24:29,181
The inevitability of truth.

1299
01:24:32,063 --> 01:24:37,130
But the complexity
and the gray lie not in the truth

1300
01:24:38,376 --> 01:24:42,149
but what you do
with the truth once you have it.

1301
01:24:49,061 --> 01:24:52,740
I think you have something
you wanna tell me.

1302
01:24:53,815 --> 01:24:57,849
I think you're very perceptive
and very capable

1303
01:24:57,849 --> 01:25:02,260
of telling me what you saw
the night of your son's party.

1304
01:25:10,483 --> 01:25:14,644
But I'll happily wait.
I'm in no rush.

1305
01:25:15,795 --> 01:25:20,758
In fact, I find it quite pleasant,
sitting here with you.

1306
01:25:28,901 --> 01:25:31,353
Lawyers were here,
very big lawyers it looked like.

1307
01:25:31,353 --> 01:25:33,864
They left all this stuff
and business cards,

1308
01:25:33,864 --> 01:25:36,045
and there was a pile
of other stuff when I got home.

1309
01:25:37,192 --> 01:25:39,339
I don't like any of this, Marta.

1310
01:25:39,475 --> 01:25:41,147
I don't like it either.

1311
01:25:41,335 --> 01:25:44,065
I'm slipping out the back.
I'll be back later.

1312
01:25:44,065 --> 01:25:45,980
Please don't talk to anyone.

1313
01:25:52,473 --> 01:25:53,814
Walt?

1314
01:25:54,317 --> 01:25:58,454
Yeah, I came from...
Hey, how are you doing?

1315
01:26:01,229 --> 01:26:03,828
Walt, I want you to know
that I didn't know about any of this.

1316
01:26:03,828 --> 01:26:06,507
We know you didn't.
We know you didn't.

1317
01:26:06,805 --> 01:26:09,847
Yeah, we all kinda went
a little crazy yesterday.

1318
01:26:09,847 --> 01:26:11,832
- Understandable.
- Yeah.

1319
01:26:13,228 --> 01:26:14,997
I haven't even looked
at all this yet.

1320
01:26:14,997 --> 01:26:20,124
It must just be local lawyers and accountants
who saw the news and wanna get a jump on it.

1321
01:26:20,878 --> 01:26:23,180
I'd be careful of all of it.

1322
01:26:24,822 --> 01:26:29,094
Marta, is it your intention
to renounce the inheritance?

1323
01:26:32,210 --> 01:26:34,664
This is what Harlan wanted.

1324
01:26:36,539 --> 01:26:40,902
Yeah, but, Harlan put you
in a very hard position here.

1325
01:26:41,663 --> 01:26:43,655
It was unfair of him.

1326
01:26:44,603 --> 01:26:48,629
You see the kind of
press and the scrutiny that this kicks up?

1327
01:26:49,221 --> 01:26:51,850
We know... with your mother.

1328
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:54,964
- My mother?
- Yeah.

1329
01:27:00,425 --> 01:27:02,118
What did Meg tell you?

1330
01:27:03,184 --> 01:27:04,703
This isn't about Meg.

1331
01:27:06,398 --> 01:27:09,550
You're missing the point.
We don't wanna attack you with this.

1332
01:27:10,098 --> 01:27:14,803
Marta, if your mother came into
the country illegally, criminally,

1333
01:27:14,933 --> 01:27:18,889
and you come into this inheritance
with all the scrutiny that entails,

1334
01:27:18,889 --> 01:27:23,256
I'd be afraid that could come to light.
That's what we wanna avoid here.

1335
01:27:23,256 --> 01:27:28,231
We can protect you from
that happening, or if it happens.

1336
01:27:28,553 --> 01:27:32,416
So, you're saying that
even if it came to light.

1337
01:27:33,493 --> 01:27:35,839
With your family's resources
you could help me fix it.

1338
01:27:35,839 --> 01:27:40,746
Yeah, with the right lawyers,
you know, not these local guys,

1339
01:27:40,746 --> 01:27:43,418
but New York lawyers,
DC lawyers.

1340
01:27:43,560 --> 01:27:45,681
With enough resources
put toward it, yes.

1341
01:27:45,681 --> 01:27:50,334
Not that that ever even needs
to come up. But yes.

1342
01:27:52,169 --> 01:27:53,723
Okay. Good.

1343
01:27:55,400 --> 01:27:56,579
Okay?

1344
01:27:57,614 --> 01:28:00,897
'Cause Harlan gave
me all your resources.

1345
01:28:01,468 --> 01:28:04,317
So, that means with my resources
I'll be able to fix it.

1346
01:28:04,317 --> 01:28:06,672
So, I guess I will find
the right lawyers.

1347
01:28:07,201 --> 01:28:08,701
Marta, that's...

1348
01:28:10,591 --> 01:28:12,652
Better be sure if that's

1349
01:28:13,625 --> 01:28:15,473
what you want.

1350
01:28:53,180 --> 01:28:54,774
I don't know. What's this?

1351
01:28:54,774 --> 01:28:58,916
It's my medical bag tag.
They have my medical bag, for some reason.

1352
01:28:59,157 --> 01:29:04,079
Okay, but this is a photocopy of just the header
of a blood toxicology report on Harlan.

1353
01:29:04,259 --> 01:29:06,460
Marta, this is gonna show
the morphine overdose.

1354
01:29:10,137 --> 01:29:11,899
So I'm screwed!

1355
01:29:13,050 --> 01:29:14,695
How do you know all this stuff?

1356
01:29:14,695 --> 01:29:17,190
I was Harlan's
research assistant for a summer.

1357
01:29:18,243 --> 01:29:20,438
But what kind of blackmail
scheme is this?

1358
01:29:20,524 --> 01:29:23,751
I mean the actual evidence
is sitting up the street at the crime lab.

1359
01:29:23,751 --> 01:29:26,328
There are no demands,
there's no meeting place.

1360
01:29:28,511 --> 01:29:30,517
What's the point
of sending you this?

1361
01:29:40,657 --> 01:29:42,779
Could be a half hour.
Could be an hour.

1362
01:29:42,779 --> 01:29:44,431
We wanna make sure...

1363
01:29:53,268 --> 01:29:55,356
- What's the cheese?
- Hey.

1364
01:29:55,356 --> 01:29:56,820
- Thank you.
- No problem.

1365
01:29:57,494 --> 01:30:00,473
5 AM, security systems
here were all triggered.

1366
01:30:00,712 --> 01:30:02,125
This thing went up really quick.

1367
01:30:02,125 --> 01:30:06,395
So that means blood stores, records,
anything of that nature, it's all gone.

1368
01:30:06,575 --> 01:30:09,680
There were no employees here,
so thank God for that.

1369
01:30:10,719 --> 01:30:13,776
- What about security cameras?
- Oh yeah.

1370
01:30:16,453 --> 01:30:19,576
Speaking of security, the surveillance tape
at the Thrombey estate

1371
01:30:19,576 --> 01:30:21,943
was all scrambled for some reason.

1372
01:30:24,199 --> 01:30:26,362
What's still pending
from the autopsy?

1373
01:30:26,843 --> 01:30:28,667
Just the report on the blood work.

1374
01:30:30,013 --> 01:30:31,739
Blood work?

1375
01:30:36,068 --> 01:30:38,150
Holy shit!

1376
01:30:41,096 --> 01:30:43,054
This is insane!

1377
01:30:43,771 --> 01:30:47,871
I mean who would blow up
the whole real building just to blackmail me?

1378
01:30:47,871 --> 01:30:50,289
Marta this means that the blackmailer
has the only paper copy

1379
01:30:50,289 --> 01:30:51,965
of the thing
that can prove your guilt.

1380
01:30:51,965 --> 01:30:55,248
You didn't get any other instructions,
no phone call, no email, nothing?

1381
01:30:57,405 --> 01:30:59,173
I haven't checked my email.

1382
01:31:04,669 --> 01:31:06,183
There is one.

1383
01:31:06,183 --> 01:31:10,175
That's it. 1209 Columbus Road, 10 AM.

1384
01:31:15,671 --> 01:31:16,891
You know what this means, right?

1385
01:31:16,891 --> 01:31:20,890
If you destroy that copy
you are totally in the clear.

1386
01:31:20,895 --> 01:31:22,347
Oh no!

1387
01:31:23,561 --> 01:31:26,311
Marta, did you hear me?

1388
01:31:27,421 --> 01:31:28,934
Yeah.

1389
01:31:36,766 --> 01:31:39,271
Elliott!
We gotta go! We gotta go!

1390
01:31:42,368 --> 01:31:43,298
Okay, Baby Driver.

1391
01:31:43,306 --> 01:31:45,721
Oh God! You regret helping me yet?

1392
01:31:45,721 --> 01:31:47,970
I regret not taking the beamer.

1393
01:31:49,706 --> 01:31:51,522
Oh shit!

1394
01:32:04,642 --> 01:32:06,447
Vehicles in pursuit in
Washington Street.

1395
01:32:06,447 --> 01:32:08,080
- Make sure you say "No force."
- No force.

1396
01:32:08,080 --> 01:32:10,971
- We got a possible murder suspect.
- I said that, I said that.

1397
01:32:12,534 --> 01:32:14,623
Go! Go!
Are you flooring it?

1398
01:32:14,623 --> 01:32:16,702
I am literally flooring it.

1399
01:32:27,369 --> 01:32:29,089
- This is going well.
- I'm pulling over.

1400
01:32:29,089 --> 01:32:32,375
If you miss your chance
to get this tox report it's all over.

1401
01:32:32,375 --> 01:32:33,881
Oh my God!

1402
01:32:38,688 --> 01:32:39,858
Why are we stopping?

1403
01:32:39,858 --> 01:32:42,376
Why are you stopping
in the middle of the road?

1404
01:32:55,496 --> 01:32:56,820
Hold on!

1405
01:33:20,521 --> 01:33:24,559
Oh my God. I'm just pure adrenaline
right now, I feel like I swallowed bees.

1406
01:33:24,878 --> 01:33:27,122
Okay, so, what is it?
What's the address?

1407
01:33:27,122 --> 01:33:29,056
- 1209 Columbus road.
- Okay.

1408
01:33:29,544 --> 01:33:31,699
I mean, whatever they want,
I'll say yes because...

1409
01:33:31,875 --> 01:33:33,364
You know, just to get
that report back.

1410
01:33:33,364 --> 01:33:35,404
- Get it back and destroy it.
- Destroy it.

1411
01:33:35,894 --> 01:33:37,698
Holy shit! Ransom.

1412
01:33:38,581 --> 01:33:42,138
Thank you. I couldn't
do this without you.

1413
01:33:45,953 --> 01:33:47,372
Oh my God!

1414
01:33:48,569 --> 01:33:50,109
Get out!

1415
01:33:51,352 --> 01:33:54,428
That was the dumbest
car chase of all time.

1416
01:33:54,428 --> 01:33:55,605
Put your hands down.

1417
01:33:55,870 --> 01:33:58,268
I spoke to Wanetta Thrombey,
Greatnana.

1418
01:33:58,776 --> 01:34:02,357
The night of the party she saw someone
climbing the trellis to the third floor.

1419
01:34:02,928 --> 01:34:05,140
Mr. Drysdale, come on.

1420
01:34:05,848 --> 01:34:07,448
Pat him down, check him out.

1421
01:34:07,448 --> 01:34:09,188
What's going on?

1422
01:34:09,380 --> 01:34:11,195
"Ransom came back" she said.

1423
01:34:12,135 --> 01:34:14,890
I don't know what he came back to do,
but we'll find out.

1424
01:34:14,983 --> 01:34:16,182
You have anything sharp?

1425
01:34:17,219 --> 01:34:19,886
- Watch your head. Thank you.
- You don't need to thank him.

1426
01:34:19,886 --> 01:34:23,569
Did he ask you to drive
when he saw me coming?

1427
01:34:24,883 --> 01:34:26,429
Yes.

1428
01:34:33,716 --> 01:34:35,127
Blanc, you're coming with us?

1429
01:34:35,127 --> 01:34:36,595
I'll drive with Marta.

1430
01:34:37,322 --> 01:34:39,162
Let's go to the police station.

1431
01:34:39,162 --> 01:34:42,274
I wanna full run down
on everything he said to you.

1432
01:34:42,462 --> 01:34:44,547
And I'll can catch you up
on where we're at.

1433
01:34:51,412 --> 01:34:54,063
Strange case from the start.

1434
01:34:55,301 --> 01:34:58,318
A case with a hole in the middle.

1435
01:35:00,251 --> 01:35:01,782
A donut?

1436
01:35:02,683 --> 01:35:06,649
I'm just talking through my process here,
let me know if this is boring.

1437
01:35:07,580 --> 01:35:12,180
I feel the noose tightening,
the family is truly desperate.

1438
01:35:12,890 --> 01:35:14,565
Desperate motives.

1439
01:35:15,139 --> 01:35:21,498
Then mystery of who hired me,
the impossibility of the crime, and yet...

1440
01:35:22,588 --> 01:35:30,191
A donut! One central piece,
and if it reveals itself the fog would lift,

1441
01:35:30,662 --> 01:35:34,175
the arc would resolve,
the slinky become unkinked.

1442
01:35:34,175 --> 01:35:36,268
Do you mind
if I stop for a second?

1443
01:35:36,439 --> 01:35:39,525
I need to pick something up.
It will be very quick.

1444
01:35:40,857 --> 01:35:42,221
Sure.

1445
01:35:55,432 --> 01:35:56,705
It'll be just a few minutes.

1446
01:35:56,705 --> 01:35:59,470
I'll watch the door.

1447
01:36:22,497 --> 01:36:24,461
Hello?

1448
01:36:47,174 --> 01:36:48,971
Listen, I don't know what you want.

1449
01:36:51,990 --> 01:36:53,805
Whatever it is we can work it out.

1450
01:36:53,805 --> 01:36:56,292
But we have to figure it out
right here, right now.

1451
01:36:56,570 --> 01:36:58,308
And I'm leaving with that report.

1452
01:37:02,857 --> 01:37:04,522
Hello?

1453
01:37:29,443 --> 01:37:31,246
Fran?

1454
01:37:40,470 --> 01:37:42,578
No, no, no! Fran.

1455
01:37:45,475 --> 01:37:48,955
Can you hear me?
Fran, give me a sign if you can hear me.

1456
01:37:48,955 --> 01:37:49,914
You.

1457
01:37:49,914 --> 01:37:51,601
Yes, it's me, it's Marta.

1458
01:37:51,601 --> 01:37:54,209
You called me here, you sent
me an email, that's why I'm here.

1459
01:37:54,209 --> 01:37:55,402
Did you take something?

1460
01:37:55,402 --> 01:37:58,020
I'm gonna call an ambulance now
and you're going to be okay.

1461
01:37:58,020 --> 01:37:59,968
You gonna be fine, okay?
Stay with me.

1462
01:38:00,338 --> 01:38:01,291
What?

1463
01:38:01,291 --> 01:38:02,612
Help me.

1464
01:38:03,339 --> 01:38:04,593
- Stashed.
- What?

1465
01:38:04,593 --> 01:38:06,433
What are you saying?

1466
01:38:07,009 --> 01:38:09,201
You did this!

1467
01:38:09,201 --> 01:38:11,292
You won't get away with this!

1468
01:38:11,292 --> 01:38:13,388
Jesus! Stop!

1469
01:38:34,951 --> 01:38:37,243
<i>911, what's your emergency?</i>

Oh lord.

1474
01:39:00,343 --> 01:39:02,654
All right my friend,
thank you for the update.

1475
01:39:04,091 --> 01:39:08,567
No need for that, I'll bring her in
once we get word that the housekeeper is stable.

1476
01:39:08,567 --> 01:39:11,633
It's still touch and go. All right.

1477
01:39:13,177 --> 01:39:15,991
This is over.
People are getting hurt.

1478
01:39:18,360 --> 01:39:19,442
So, I'm gonna tell you
the truth.

1479
01:39:19,442 --> 01:39:23,616
Young Ransom just told
Lieutenant Elliott everything.

1480
01:39:23,823 --> 01:39:26,966
Good. Wait, I hope
he didn't cover for me.

1481
01:39:26,966 --> 01:39:29,593
Did he tell the real truth
about me switching the...

1482
01:39:29,593 --> 01:39:30,425
Yeah.

1483
01:39:30,425 --> 01:39:32,523
- And the disguise...
- Yes.

1484
01:39:32,523 --> 01:39:34,233
And the whole blackmailing...

1485
01:39:35,042 --> 01:39:37,199
But why did Fran take my morphine?

1486
01:39:37,660 --> 01:39:39,626
Obviously, she had swiped
a bag from the house,

1487
01:39:39,626 --> 01:39:43,770
but she didn't seem like a user to me,
unless that's why she needed the blackmail money...

1488
01:39:44,049 --> 01:39:46,062
I don't know,
it doesn't matter anyway.

1489
01:39:46,427 --> 01:39:49,401
I have to tell the Thrombeys myself,
I feel like I owe that to them.

1490
01:39:49,401 --> 01:39:50,570
I don't think that's a good idea.

1491
01:39:50,570 --> 01:39:52,745
No, I have to do it!
I need to do it!

1492
01:39:55,012 --> 01:39:58,183
I gave the doctors my number,
so they'll call if anything changes with Fran.

1493
01:39:58,183 --> 01:39:59,308
All right.

1494
01:39:59,308 --> 01:40:02,578
We'll round up the Thrombeys
at the house, along with a police escort.

1495
01:40:03,147 --> 01:40:05,342
For the arrest after.

1496
01:40:05,536 --> 01:40:08,561
You can tell me your whole
story on the drive over.

1497
01:40:09,093 --> 01:40:11,410
I don't want any more surprises.

1498
01:40:26,826 --> 01:40:29,111
Fran said it was stashed, the copy,

1499
01:40:29,277 --> 01:40:33,243
and then she said,
"you did this, you won't get away with it."

1500
01:40:34,650 --> 01:40:37,761
I called the ambulance. That's it.

1501
01:40:38,912 --> 01:40:40,283
All right.

1502
01:40:42,039 --> 01:40:43,888
You ready?

1503
01:40:50,551 --> 01:40:53,805
Okay, has she come
to her senses?

1504
01:40:54,028 --> 01:40:56,263
She's standing right there Richard,
she can speak for herself.

1505
01:40:56,263 --> 01:40:57,841
Is the rest of the family here?

1506
01:40:57,841 --> 01:40:59,743
- In the living room.
- I think it would be better if we were

1507
01:40:59,743 --> 01:41:02,349
to gather together
and get this over with.

1508
01:41:07,856 --> 01:41:09,691
- Hey.
- Hey.

1509
01:41:11,630 --> 01:41:13,374
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry I told them
about your mom.

1510
01:41:13,374 --> 01:41:15,254
Meg, it's okay.

1511
01:41:15,970 --> 01:41:18,664
I'm sorry. No, I was scared, I just,
I didn't wanna tell them...

1512
01:41:18,664 --> 01:41:21,395
I get it. Trust me.

1513
01:41:22,489 --> 01:41:24,745
I understand. It's all right.

1514
01:41:25,743 --> 01:41:27,445
I'm sorry.

1515
01:41:29,849 --> 01:41:32,521
God, I'm so raiding Fran's
stash after this.

1516
01:41:32,713 --> 01:41:37,984
I still think this is a bad idea,
but the family is assembled.

1517
01:41:41,428 --> 01:41:43,725
I know where the tox report is.

1518
01:41:50,662 --> 01:41:52,551
She basically told me where it was.

1519
01:41:55,049 --> 01:41:57,218
Anyway this will tie everything up.

1520
01:41:59,093 --> 01:42:01,176
And I just handed it to you.

1521
01:42:02,178 --> 01:42:04,930
God, you're not much
of a detective, are you?

1522
01:42:05,712 --> 01:42:07,218
To be fair.

1523
01:42:08,800 --> 01:42:11,689
You make a pretty lousy murderer.

1524
01:42:13,102 --> 01:42:15,531
Perhaps we deserve each other.

1525
01:42:26,968 --> 01:42:29,493
You've always been good to me.

1526
01:42:30,964 --> 01:42:34,653
What I'm about to say isn't gonna be easy
and you're gonna be upset.

1527
01:42:35,287 --> 01:42:38,698
But I thought after what
you've gone through the last few days,

1528
01:42:39,444 --> 01:42:42,466
that you deserved
to hear it from me.

1529
01:42:44,684 --> 01:42:45,144
I...

1530
01:42:45,144 --> 01:42:46,582
Excuse me!

1531
01:42:50,520 --> 01:42:52,980
You have not been
good to her.

1532
01:42:53,526 --> 01:42:57,517
You have all treated her like shit
to steal back a fortune

1533
01:42:57,517 --> 01:42:59,731
that you lost and she deserves.

1534
01:42:59,891 --> 01:43:02,916
You're a pack of vultures
at the feast.

1535
01:43:02,916 --> 01:43:05,116
Nose all beak's bloody.

1536
01:43:05,116 --> 01:43:09,662
Well, you're not getting
bailed out, not this time.

1537
01:43:10,422 --> 01:43:15,043
Ms. Cabrera has decided definitively
not to renounce the inheritance.

1538
01:43:15,043 --> 01:43:15,940
What?

1539
01:43:16,296 --> 01:43:16,875
What?

1540
01:43:16,875 --> 01:43:21,118
Furthermore, it will be my professional
recommendation to the local authorities

1541
01:43:21,118 --> 01:43:23,723
that the manner of death
in the case of Harlan Thrombey

1542
01:43:23,723 --> 01:43:27,752
is ruled as suicide,
and the case is closed.

1543
01:43:27,752 --> 01:43:28,769
- Blanc.
- What?

1544
01:43:28,769 --> 01:43:30,507
Thank you all for coming.
Goodbye.

1545
01:43:30,507 --> 01:43:31,746
What's going on?

1546
01:43:31,746 --> 01:43:33,097
Just tell me what's...

1547
01:43:34,381 --> 01:43:37,065
That's certainly not
what I was expecting.

1548
01:43:38,001 --> 01:43:39,120
Is anybody else confused?

1549
01:43:39,120 --> 01:43:41,454
Not what I was
expecting to hear at all.

1550
01:43:44,294 --> 01:43:45,798
Are you gonna tell me
what the hell is going on?

1551
01:43:45,798 --> 01:43:46,681
Yes.

1552
01:43:46,681 --> 01:43:48,837
I just wanna come clean, okay?

1553
01:43:48,837 --> 01:43:50,107
- It's over.
- Almost.

1554
01:43:50,107 --> 01:43:51,441
Blanc, what are we doing?

1555
01:43:51,441 --> 01:43:53,755
I'm sorry. Officer Wagner.

1556
01:43:54,212 --> 01:43:57,162
Keep the family out of this room,
get them out of the house if you can.

1557
01:43:57,162 --> 01:43:59,419
But stand by
with your additional officer.

1558
01:43:59,419 --> 01:44:01,643
- Get the family out?
- Yes, but not all of them.

1559
01:44:03,233 --> 01:44:03,891
Blanc.

1560
01:44:03,891 --> 01:44:05,024
- Yes, sir.
- Come on. Come on.

1561
01:44:05,024 --> 01:44:06,073
What's with all this drama?

1562
01:44:06,073 --> 01:44:07,133
Indulge me.

1563
01:44:07,133 --> 01:44:10,911
Blanc. I told Ransom, Ransom told
you, I'm telling you now -

1564
01:44:11,530 --> 01:44:14,263
it is an immovable fact
that I killed Harlan.

1565
01:44:14,263 --> 01:44:17,528
Yes, you did. Yes, he did.
Yes, you are, but. But.

1566
01:44:18,092 --> 01:44:21,947
I spoke in the car about the hole
at the center of this donut.

1567
01:44:22,465 --> 01:44:26,309
And what you and Harlan did that fateful
night seems at first glance

1568
01:44:26,309 --> 01:44:28,177
to fill that hole perfectly.

1569
01:44:28,332 --> 01:44:30,898
A donut hole in a donut's hole.

1570
01:44:31,742 --> 01:44:33,780
But we must look a little closer.

1571
01:44:34,469 --> 01:44:39,536
And when we do, we see that
the donut hole has a hole in its center.

1572
01:44:39,709 --> 01:44:44,721
It is not a donut hole, but a smaller
donut with its own hole,

1573
01:44:44,874 --> 01:44:47,729
and our donut is not holed at all!

1574
01:44:47,729 --> 01:44:50,020
Blanc, look, I understand that
this is amusing for you.

1575
01:44:50,020 --> 01:44:54,643
Why was I hired?
Why would someone hire me?

1576
01:44:54,643 --> 01:44:57,216
Someone fishing for a crime
to reverse the will, Blanc.

1577
01:44:57,216 --> 01:44:59,687
I was hired before
the sealed will was read.

1578
01:45:00,073 --> 01:45:04,017
So yes, the person must have
known the contents of the will.

1579
01:45:04,632 --> 01:45:08,982
But one step further - that same person
must have known a crime was committed,

1580
01:45:08,982 --> 01:45:10,249
and further,

1581
01:45:10,787 --> 01:45:14,836
if the intent was to reverse
Marta's inheritance,

1582
01:45:15,744 --> 01:45:18,357
they must've known
that Marta was responsible.

1583
01:45:19,061 --> 01:45:23,077
An intriguing combination of factors.
Someone who knew what Marta did,

1584
01:45:23,077 --> 01:45:26,524
wanted to expose it,
but could not reveal how they knew.

1585
01:45:26,686 --> 01:45:30,743
Fran! She was blackmailing me,
she knew what I did.

1586
01:45:30,893 --> 01:45:34,855
But Fran wanted money,
ergo she did not want the crime exposed.

1587
01:45:34,855 --> 01:45:37,681
Did someone in the family observe Marta
doing something suspicious?

1588
01:45:37,681 --> 01:45:40,831
But they would've had no reason
not to speak up.

1589
01:45:42,908 --> 01:45:45,805
The answer is not so simple.

1590
01:45:46,674 --> 01:45:50,936
Now with the entire solution
in my field of view.

1591
01:45:50,936 --> 01:45:54,155
The arc of this case
is a tragedy of errors.

1592
01:45:56,544 --> 01:45:58,967
And Marta, it will not be easy
for you to hear.

1593
01:45:59,573 --> 01:46:05,294
But there is at least one
truly guilty party behind it all,

1594
01:46:05,294 --> 01:46:08,377
guilty in the true sense
of acting with malice,

1595
01:46:08,884 --> 01:46:11,807
committing a heinous crime
with selfish intent.

1596
01:46:14,779 --> 01:46:16,335
Trooper Wagner.

1597
01:46:16,335 --> 01:46:17,924
Trooper Wagner?

1598
01:46:19,135 --> 01:46:20,522
No.

1599
01:46:22,048 --> 01:46:25,870
Marta, I'm so sorry. I told them everything,
I figured it was up. I'm sorry.

1600
01:46:25,870 --> 01:46:28,160
It's all right, Ransom,
I'm glad you did.

1601
01:46:28,160 --> 01:46:30,394
Not exactly everything though.

1602
01:46:30,795 --> 01:46:32,792
Is this about what
Greatnana told you?

1603
01:46:33,090 --> 01:46:36,215
She saw me that night,
she mistook me for Ransom.

1604
01:46:36,215 --> 01:46:38,707
We'll get to that.
In the meanwhile,

1605
01:46:39,186 --> 01:46:41,604
Mr. Hugh Ransom Drysdale,

1606
01:46:41,941 --> 01:46:46,007
you might tell us all
why you hired me?

1607
01:46:49,222 --> 01:46:50,834
Why I hired you?

1608
01:46:51,336 --> 01:46:54,949
You're right, let's back up.
To the night of the party.

1609
01:46:55,059 --> 01:46:57,158
Your argument with Harlan.

1610
01:46:57,608 --> 01:47:01,980
What were the overheard words
by the Nazi child, masturbating in the bathroom?

1611
01:47:02,206 --> 01:47:05,329
"my will" and
"I'm warning you."

1612
01:47:05,859 --> 01:47:11,527
You and Harlan were "drama mamas," you shared
a love of twisting the knife into one another.

1613
01:47:11,549 --> 01:47:15,467
You see, I don't believe he would've
slipped it in halfway - no, no, no.

1614
01:47:16,280 --> 01:47:20,474
I submit Harlan told you everything.

1615
01:47:20,596 --> 01:47:21,956
You can't be serious!

1616
01:47:21,956 --> 01:47:27,999
Not a red dime or word of my work
to a single one of them, you included.

1617
01:47:28,508 --> 01:47:34,001
Marta, remind me what Ransom said
his conversation with Harlan ended with.

1618
01:47:34,547 --> 01:47:37,033
Harlan told him that I could beat
him at GO.

1619
01:47:37,033 --> 01:47:39,961
And I asked myself - Marta?

1620
01:47:40,328 --> 01:47:44,382
How would the topic of the will
have steered around to Marta?

1621
01:47:45,822 --> 01:47:49,048
There is one obvious explanation.

1622
01:47:49,159 --> 01:47:52,047
You can't be that crazy, you're not
just gonna throw away your fortune.

1623
01:47:52,047 --> 01:47:55,319
No. I'm giving it to Marta.
All of it.

1624
01:47:56,616 --> 01:47:59,318
Your Brazilian nurse?
Are you goddamn insane?

1625
01:47:59,318 --> 01:48:03,585
I am sane for the first time
in my life and I've done it.

1626
01:48:04,294 --> 01:48:07,237
I've made the change
to my will, it's done.

1627
01:48:07,535 --> 01:48:08,818
I'm warning you!

1628
01:48:09,756 --> 01:48:11,993
That's some heavy duty conjecture.

1629
01:48:12,043 --> 01:48:13,479
Granted.

1630
01:48:13,681 --> 01:48:17,149
But it is the only way of
what comes next makes sense.

1631
01:48:17,542 --> 01:48:21,103
So, you storm out,
you drive off into the night.

1632
01:48:21,862 --> 01:48:26,170
You tell Marta later of, what was it?
Feeling an overwhelming sense of...

1633
01:48:26,351 --> 01:48:30,856
Clarity. That he has to make do
for himself from here on out.

1634
01:48:31,181 --> 01:48:32,740
Exactly!

1635
01:48:35,379 --> 01:48:39,801
Marta. The will. Harlan.
Do for yourself.

1636
01:48:39,801 --> 01:48:42,060
"You won't get away with this."

1637
01:48:42,562 --> 01:48:44,593
And a plan forms.

1638
01:48:53,051 --> 01:48:57,491
You return, careful to avoid the
gate's security camera range.

1639
01:48:57,641 --> 01:48:59,906
Then on foot up towards the house.

1640
01:49:00,045 --> 01:49:04,354
You sneak in, up the trellis so as
not to be seen by the rest of the family,

1641
01:49:04,354 --> 01:49:07,031
who are still having their
party downstairs.

1642
01:49:08,956 --> 01:49:12,323
What you need to do
will take moments.

1643
01:49:12,898 --> 01:49:17,004
But it is essential that
you are alone and undetected.

1644
01:49:17,312 --> 01:49:19,768
You knew what medications Harlan took.

1645
01:49:19,768 --> 01:49:22,540
You knew what Marta would be
injecting him with that night.

1646
01:49:23,858 --> 01:49:31,203
And you knew if Marta was responsible
for his death, even unintentionally,

1647
01:49:32,028 --> 01:49:37,624
the slayer rule would nullify the changed will,
and you would get your share back.

1648
01:49:38,533 --> 01:49:42,901
You use the syringes in the kit to switch
the liquids in the two medication vials.

1649
01:49:42,901 --> 01:49:45,872
And, as a final precaution,

1650
01:49:47,794 --> 01:49:53,022
you took the Naloxone,
the life saving antidote.

1651
01:49:53,421 --> 01:49:55,647
No, no. That's impossible.

1652
01:49:55,873 --> 01:49:57,316
It is the truth.

1653
01:49:57,487 --> 01:50:00,042
Hand me that vial of morphine,
I'll show you.

1654
01:50:00,042 --> 01:50:05,029
If he did that, if the meds were switched,
then when I got them mixed up...

1655
01:50:07,134 --> 01:50:09,791
I accidentally switched them back.

1656
01:50:10,687 --> 01:50:11,861
I gave Harlan...

1657
01:50:11,861 --> 01:50:13,600
The correct doses.

1658
01:50:13,919 --> 01:50:15,515
Yes.

1659
01:50:17,585 --> 01:50:19,571
But not accidentally.

1660
01:50:20,574 --> 01:50:24,169
I taped over the labels
of these two vials.

1661
01:50:25,046 --> 01:50:28,083
The vials themselves are identical.

1662
01:50:30,405 --> 01:50:32,638
How'd you know
that this was the morphine?

1663
01:50:33,073 --> 01:50:34,523
I just knew.

1664
01:50:34,523 --> 01:50:37,691
You knew because there is the slightest,
almost imperceptible difference

1665
01:50:37,691 --> 01:50:40,281
of tincture and viscosity
between the two liquids.

1666
01:50:42,226 --> 01:50:45,763
You knew because you'd done it
a hundred times.

1667
01:50:46,717 --> 01:50:52,360
You gave him the correct medication
because you are a good nurse.

1668
01:50:53,285 --> 01:50:54,242
Then Harlan was...

1669
01:50:54,242 --> 01:50:56,889
I'm sorry Marta, but yes.

1670
01:50:57,969 --> 01:51:00,185
Harlan was perfectly fine.

1671
01:51:01,004 --> 01:51:02,876
His blood was normal.

1672
01:51:03,409 --> 01:51:09,336
The cause of death was truly,
solely suicide, and you are guilty of nothing

1673
01:51:09,336 --> 01:51:12,354
but some damage to the trellis
and a few amateur theatrics.

1674
01:51:13,237 --> 01:51:17,858
In fact, if Harlan had listened to you
and called the ambulance,

1675
01:51:19,368 --> 01:51:21,871
he would be alive today.

1676
01:51:24,289 --> 01:51:25,880
Hot damn.

1677
01:51:25,880 --> 01:51:27,687
A twisted web.

1678
01:51:28,607 --> 01:51:32,093
And we are not finished
untangling it. Not yet.

1679
01:51:32,766 --> 01:51:37,006
Marta, when Greatnana spotted you
climbing down the trellis she said,

1680
01:51:38,260 --> 01:51:41,973
Ransom? Are you back again already?

1681
01:51:41,973 --> 01:51:46,373
<i>"Are you back again already?"
'Cause earlier that night</i>

1682
01:51:49,426 --> 01:51:51,990
Ransom, you're back!

1683
01:51:54,131 --> 01:51:55,518
Come on, Marta.

1684
01:51:55,518 --> 01:51:59,116
This is stoopid with two o's.
You don't have a shred of evidence,

1685
01:51:59,116 --> 01:52:00,418
You're just spinning a fairy tale.

1686
01:52:00,418 --> 01:52:02,299
Not a shred, no.

1687
01:52:02,474 --> 01:52:05,656
Just as we have no real proof
of Marta's mixing up the vials.

1688
01:52:05,656 --> 01:52:08,290
- so it's your word against.
- You have her confession!

1689
01:52:10,949 --> 01:52:14,396
All right, yeah.
Yeah, we do have that.

1690
01:52:14,396 --> 01:52:17,041
With your permission,
I'd like to spin a little further.

1691
01:52:17,710 --> 01:52:20,406
Much later that night you'd have
to come back to the house

1692
01:52:20,406 --> 01:52:22,908
to retrieve the incriminating
tampered vials.

1693
01:52:23,228 --> 01:52:26,653
However, this time
the dogs were outside.

1694
01:52:28,996 --> 01:52:31,126
They barked waking Meg.

1695
01:52:31,126 --> 01:52:33,951
No matter.
You'll get the vials tomorrow.

1696
01:52:34,405 --> 01:52:38,747
But tomorrow brings news,
not of a medical error and guilty nurse,

1697
01:52:38,747 --> 01:52:41,718
but of a slit throat and suicide.

1698
01:52:45,851 --> 01:52:50,809
Now the circumstances are perfect
for the anonymous hiring of a me:

1699
01:52:51,324 --> 01:52:53,474
you know a crime has been committed
by Ms. Cabrera,

1700
01:52:53,474 --> 01:52:58,026
you need her to be caught for it,
you cannot reveal how you know.

1701
01:52:59,793 --> 01:53:02,308
Enter Benoit Blanc.

1702
01:53:02,770 --> 01:53:05,593
Benny, look I hear
what you are saying, it's just...

1703
01:53:06,439 --> 01:53:08,479
The body is discovered
early the next morning.

1704
01:53:08,479 --> 01:53:13,226
The police, the medical examiners,
the family, everyone swarms in,

1705
01:53:13,226 --> 01:53:18,217
and there is no possible way you can get
to Marta's medical bag to retrieve the vials.

1706
01:53:18,398 --> 01:53:21,560
You must wait for your moment
when the investigation is over

1707
01:53:21,560 --> 01:53:24,572
and you know
the house will be empty.

1708
01:53:25,176 --> 01:53:28,839
That is why you missed the funeral.

1709
01:53:30,005 --> 01:53:33,729
There is no one home to wonder
why you're going into Harlan's study.

1710
01:53:34,965 --> 01:53:36,619
Or so you think.

1711
01:53:39,880 --> 01:53:45,203
Poor Fran. She witnessed you tampering
with Harlan's medication in the medical bag.

1712
01:53:45,253 --> 01:53:48,657
She did not know
what you were doing.

1713
01:53:48,987 --> 01:53:53,762
But she knew you were up to no good,
so her mind begins to turn.

1714
01:53:53,762 --> 01:53:58,448
Oh God, that Hallmark movie
she told me about, with Danica McKellar.

1715
01:53:58,622 --> 01:53:59,889
"Deadly By Surprise."

1716
01:53:59,889 --> 01:54:01,398
That's what she
was talking about.

1717
01:54:01,548 --> 01:54:04,667
She loved Harlan. She hates Ransom.

1718
01:54:05,113 --> 01:54:09,149
So the poor girl decides to test her theory
and make this asshole pay.

1719
01:54:09,149 --> 01:54:15,741
She gets a copy of the toxicology report,
I will be honest I have no idea how.

1720
01:54:15,741 --> 01:54:17,580
'Cause she has a cousin.

1721
01:54:17,880 --> 01:54:21,424
She told me, she has a cousin who works
as a receptionist at the examiners office.

1722
01:54:21,424 --> 01:54:22,906
Well, Voilà!

1723
01:54:22,906 --> 01:54:25,676
The numbers, they mean
nothing to her,

1724
01:54:25,676 --> 01:54:29,356
but if Ransom is guilty,
its existence is a threat,

1725
01:54:29,356 --> 01:54:32,913
so she photocopies the header
and makes her blackmail note.

1726
01:54:33,619 --> 01:54:35,163
So, why did she send it to me?

1727
01:54:35,163 --> 01:54:38,503
She didn't. She sent it to Ransom.

1728
01:54:43,596 --> 01:54:47,744
And when Mr. Drysdale gets it,
what is his reaction?

1729
01:54:48,264 --> 01:54:53,145
Elation! He still thinks Marta has
given Harlan the tampered drugs!

1730
01:54:53,145 --> 01:54:55,826
A blood tox report
will prove her guilt.

1731
01:54:55,997 --> 01:55:00,997
He goes to the will reading in high spirits,
ready to see the family tear itself apart,

1732
01:55:00,997 --> 01:55:06,476
secure in the knowledge it will all be undone
when the tox report comes to light.

1733
01:55:07,409 --> 01:55:09,146
And then...

1734
01:55:09,998 --> 01:55:11,986
Marta's confession.

1735
01:55:12,381 --> 01:55:14,871
And everything turns on its head.

1736
01:55:14,871 --> 01:55:19,223
Now he realizes that Marta
has committed no crime,

1737
01:55:19,223 --> 01:55:23,002
and the tox report
will prove her innocence.

1738
01:55:23,315 --> 01:55:27,584
The changed will is gonna stand.
He has lost.

1739
01:55:29,372 --> 01:55:30,975
Unless...

1740
01:55:31,536 --> 01:55:33,305
Unless you decide.

1741
01:55:33,305 --> 01:55:34,583
You're not gonna
give up the money.

1742
01:55:34,583 --> 01:55:36,612
You're not gonna
give up the money.

1743
01:55:36,671 --> 01:55:39,309
- You've come this far!
- You've come this far!

1744
01:55:40,190 --> 01:55:42,557
Just one step further.

1745
01:55:42,746 --> 01:55:47,837
Just one last act,
in for a penny, in for a pound.

1746
01:55:50,453 --> 01:55:52,649
You decide. You are in.

1747
01:55:57,444 --> 01:56:02,769
Step one: destroy all evidence
of Marta's innocence.

1748
01:56:09,247 --> 01:56:15,263
Step two: send her the anonymous email
with a late morning rendezvous time,

1749
01:56:18,880 --> 01:56:21,953
and deliver her the blackmail note.

1750
01:56:24,298 --> 01:56:28,820
Step three: keep your appointment
with Fran.

1751
01:56:30,636 --> 01:56:34,966
I knew it! I knew you were
a no good son of a bitch!

1752
01:56:35,304 --> 01:56:37,179
I knew Harlan wouldn't
just kill himself.

1753
01:56:37,534 --> 01:56:39,186
Yes, Fran, you are right.

1754
01:56:39,350 --> 01:56:43,794
I knew you were guilty as shit.
And now you're gonna pay for it!

1755
01:56:44,134 --> 01:56:45,600
Don't you come near me!

1756
01:56:45,760 --> 01:56:47,582
Don't come near me,
I'm warning you!

1757
01:56:58,350 --> 01:57:01,947
Now the board is set.
Marta will get the blackmail note.

1758
01:57:01,947 --> 01:57:03,916
You'll put the pieces together for her.

1759
01:57:04,083 --> 01:57:06,092
You'll guide her to the rendezvous.

1760
01:57:06,246 --> 01:57:08,204
You'll make an anonymous call
to the police.

1761
01:57:08,280 --> 01:57:11,296
They will catch her there
with the body and the burned evidence.

1762
01:57:11,296 --> 01:57:15,287
Marta will get arrested
for killing Fran and Harlan.

1763
01:57:16,823 --> 01:57:17,671
She said:

1764
01:57:17,671 --> 01:57:19,378
You did this!

1765
01:57:20,324 --> 01:57:26,247
<i>She didn't say "you did this,"
she wasn't talking about me, she said,</i>

1766
01:57:26,247 --> 01:57:28,648
Hugh did this.

1767
01:57:28,648 --> 01:57:32,899
Hugh did this, 'cause you made
the help call you Hugh.

1768
01:57:34,289 --> 01:57:36,155
'Cause you're an asshole.

1769
01:57:36,971 --> 01:57:38,928
It would have worked.

1770
01:57:39,295 --> 01:57:43,899
If we hadn't have brought you in for questioning,
so you could not make your anonymous call.

1771
01:57:43,899 --> 01:57:47,954
And if Fran had not stashed
a safety copy of the tox report.

1772
01:57:48,464 --> 01:57:52,405
And if Marta had not outplayed you
once again,

1773
01:57:53,471 --> 01:57:55,458
by having a kind heart.

1774
01:57:57,384 --> 01:57:59,627
By saving Fran's life,

1775
01:57:59,964 --> 01:58:03,225
though it meant her losing the inheritance
and going to jail.

1776
01:58:03,225 --> 01:58:08,324
She didn't play your game,
she saved Fran's life.

1777
01:58:11,540 --> 01:58:13,030
Fran's alive?

1778
01:58:13,379 --> 01:58:14,788
Oh yes.

1779
01:58:14,788 --> 01:58:21,734
Fran, who will confirm this
fairy story or something close to it.

1780
01:58:22,655 --> 01:58:27,692
And send you, Hugh, to jail.

1781
01:58:32,383 --> 01:58:34,009
Yes.

1782
01:58:36,857 --> 01:58:41,585
Doctor, that's great news.
We'll be there soon. Thank you.

1783
01:58:46,232 --> 01:58:49,129
She's okay. She's ready to talk.

1784
01:58:49,582 --> 01:58:52,985
Trooper Wagner, if you could
keep Mr. Drysdale in custody

1785
01:58:52,985 --> 01:58:55,460
while Lieutenant Elliott,
Ms. Cabrera and myself

1786
01:58:55,572 --> 01:58:57,724
we go to the hospital
and take Fran's statement.

1787
01:58:57,724 --> 01:58:59,609
All right. Up. Come on.

1788
01:59:05,434 --> 01:59:07,176
I'm gonna say this just to you.

1789
01:59:07,533 --> 01:59:10,725
No cameras, no courtroom, just to you
because you know it's the truth.

1790
01:59:11,554 --> 01:59:13,437
We allowed you into our home.

1791
01:59:13,437 --> 01:59:16,749
We let you watch our granddad,
we welcomed you into our family.

1792
01:59:16,749 --> 01:59:18,977
And now you think
you can steal it from us?

1793
01:59:18,977 --> 01:59:23,308
You think I'm not gonna fight
to protect my home, our birthright,

1794
01:59:24,164 --> 01:59:26,858
our ancestral family home?

1795
01:59:29,019 --> 01:59:30,208
That is hooey!

1796
01:59:30,619 --> 01:59:34,326
Harlan, he bought this place in the 80s
from a Pakistani real estate billionaire.

1797
01:59:34,326 --> 01:59:36,245
Oh, shut up Blanc! Shut up!

1798
01:59:36,245 --> 01:59:41,096
Shut up with that Kentucky fried
fog horn rag-horn drawl.

1799
01:59:41,461 --> 01:59:45,064
Yeah, I killed Fran, but I guess I didn't.
So what do you have on me?

1800
01:59:45,228 --> 01:59:47,114
Nothing. What?
Attempted murder?

1801
01:59:47,114 --> 01:59:50,554
I get arson for the building, and a few
other charges, with a good lawyer,

1802
01:59:50,554 --> 01:59:53,397
which I have,
I'll be out in no time.

1803
01:59:53,397 --> 01:59:59,533
And then you'll see just how much hell
I can wreak on your life, you vicious little bitch.

1804
02:00:07,037 --> 02:00:08,542
What the shit!?

1805
02:00:09,560 --> 02:00:12,618
- That means she's lying!
- Yeah, man, we know.

1806
02:00:12,618 --> 02:00:16,080
That's right, Fran's dead.

1807
02:00:20,063 --> 02:00:22,448
And you just confessed to her murder.

1808
02:00:34,930 --> 02:00:36,307
Well...

1809
02:00:37,162 --> 02:00:38,718
In for a penny...

1810
02:01:22,844 --> 02:01:24,414
Shit!

1811
02:02:51,609 --> 02:02:55,626
... He's cheating on you, I have proof I know
you don't need to see. Untether yourself - Dad.

1812
02:02:57,075 --> 02:02:59,334
Linda?

1813
02:02:59,661 --> 02:03:02,602
We gotta get the attorneys
on the phone. Right now!

1814
02:03:10,201 --> 02:03:14,817
Can I ask? When did you know I had
something to do with Harlan's death?

1815
02:03:15,794 --> 02:03:19,559
From the first moment you
set foot in front of me.

1816
02:03:23,654 --> 02:03:24,795
Oh shit!

1817
02:03:24,795 --> 02:03:28,762
I want you to remember
something that's very important:

1818
02:03:29,368 --> 02:03:35,425
you won not by playing the game
Harlan's way, but yours.

1819
02:03:37,629 --> 02:03:40,023
You're a good person.

1820
02:03:41,308 --> 02:03:42,974
This family.

1821
02:03:48,882 --> 02:03:51,287
I should help them, right?

1822
02:03:52,541 --> 02:03:54,871
I have my own opinion.

1823
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:59,197
But I have a feeling
you'll follow your heart.
