174
00:09:33,212 --> 00:09:36,674
I'm saying, he's holding nothing
better than a pair of face cards.

175
00:09:36,924 --> 00:09:38,342
Barry?

176
00:09:41,304 --> 00:09:42,638
All right.

177
00:09:43,097 --> 00:09:44,891
I fold.

178
00:09:47,018 --> 00:09:49,562
- Josh?
- Don't worry, I'm game.

179
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:54,525
I will see your $500 and I
will raise you another...

180
00:09:55,067 --> 00:09:56,372
...$500 of my own.

181
00:09:56,373 --> 00:09:58,571
<i>RUSTY: That's a
handsome bet Josh.</i>

182
00:09:58,821 --> 00:10:02,417
But be careful we don't wanna
push him too high too fast.

183
00:10:02,418 --> 00:10:04,452
Want to keep him on the leash.

184
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:06,662
- Holly?
- Call.

185
00:10:06,738 --> 00:10:08,831
- Call.
- Call.

186
00:10:09,665 --> 00:10:11,375
And I'll call.

187
00:10:14,795 --> 00:10:18,674
DANNY: I'll see your $500
and raise you $2000.

188
00:10:19,425 --> 00:10:22,845
Guys, you're free to do what you like.
It's a lot of money.

189
00:10:23,054 --> 00:10:24,578
But I'm staying in.

190
00:10:24,579 --> 00:10:28,267
He's trying to buy his
way out of his bluff.

191
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:32,313
- Josh?
- Two.

192
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:39,070
Thattagirl. Call.

193
00:10:39,654 --> 00:10:41,481
- Call.
- Call.

194
00:10:45,159 --> 00:10:46,911
RUSTY: Let's see them.

195
00:10:47,119 --> 00:10:50,041
<i>DANNY: I'm not sure
what four nines does,</i>

196
00:10:50,042 --> 00:10:52,301
<i>but the ace, I think,
is pretty high.</i>

197
00:10:52,325 --> 00:10:53,825
<i>Dude!</i>

198
00:10:54,126 --> 00:10:56,420
<i>JOSH: Thanks for the tip
on calling off a bluff.</i>

199
00:10:57,046 --> 00:11:02,009
FAN: Hey, Topher! How about an
autograph? Come on, real quick.

200
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:05,097
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

201
00:11:17,775 --> 00:11:20,055
- God, I'm bored.
- You look bored.

202
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:21,579
I am bored.

203
00:11:22,405 --> 00:11:25,017
<i>So, how was the clink?
You get the cookies I sent?</i>

204
00:11:26,576 --> 00:11:28,720
<i>Why do you think I
came to see you first?</i>

205
00:11:30,454 --> 00:11:32,790
- So tell me.
- It's tricky.

206
00:11:33,082 --> 00:11:37,670
It's never been done before.
It'll need planning and a large crew.

207
00:11:38,588 --> 00:11:40,064
- Guns?
- Not exactly.

208
00:11:40,065 --> 00:11:42,066
Lot of security.
But The take...

209
00:11:42,425 --> 00:11:44,260
- What's the target?
- Eight figures each.

210
00:11:44,468 --> 00:11:46,187
What's the target?

211
00:11:47,847 --> 00:11:50,217
When was the last time
you were in Vegas?

212
00:11:51,225 --> 00:11:53,620
What? You want to
knock over a casino?

213
00:12:07,241 --> 00:12:09,243
<i>DANNY:
The vault at the Bellagio.</i>

214
00:12:14,081 --> 00:12:18,085
<i>RUSTY: Well, If I'm reading this
right, and I like to think I am...</i>

215
00:12:18,252 --> 00:12:22,089
...this is probably the least
accessible vault ever designed.

216
00:12:22,207 --> 00:12:23,583
Yep.

217
00:12:24,175 --> 00:12:26,177
You said three casinos?

218
00:12:26,427 --> 00:12:32,350
These feed into the cages in Mirage and
MGM Grand, but every dime ends up there.

219
00:12:33,226 --> 00:12:35,895
The Bellagio and the Mirage.

220
00:12:36,103 --> 00:12:38,591
These are Terry
Benedict's places.

221
00:12:38,592 --> 00:12:39,874
Yes, they are.

222
00:12:40,483 --> 00:12:43,361
- You think he'll mind?
- More than somewhat.

223
00:12:43,569 --> 00:12:47,657
You'd need at least a dozen guys
doing a combination of cons.

224
00:12:47,865 --> 00:12:49,534
Like what, you think?

225
00:12:49,742 --> 00:12:52,207
Well, off the top of my head,
I'd say you're looking at..

226
00:12:52,208 --> 00:12:54,997
...a Boesky, a Jim Brown...

227
00:12:55,206 --> 00:12:57,625
...a Miss Daisy, Two
Jethros, and a Leon Spinks.

228
00:12:57,875 --> 00:13:01,754
Not to mention the biggest
Ella Fitzgerald ever.

229
00:13:01,963 --> 00:13:04,841
Where do you think you're gonna
get the money to back this?

230
00:13:05,049 --> 00:13:08,177
We're hitting these three casinos,
we'll get our bankroll.

231
00:13:08,386 --> 00:13:10,805
Benedict's got a long
list of enemies.

232
00:13:11,055 --> 00:13:14,892
Yeah, but enemies with loose
cash and nothing to lose?

233
00:13:15,917 --> 00:13:17,417
Aha.

234
00:13:18,104 --> 00:13:19,689
- Reuben.
- Reuben.

235
00:13:19,981 --> 00:13:21,399
<i>SECURITY GUARD: Hey.</i>

236
00:13:22,692 --> 00:13:25,111
DANNY: Oscar, lower it a bit,
would you?

237
00:13:25,653 --> 00:13:28,698
Sorry. You guys done up here?
Find what you want?

238
00:13:28,906 --> 00:13:31,993
We'll take these home for the night
to make some copies. If it's all right.

239
00:13:32,201 --> 00:13:35,204
- Whatever you need.
- Appreciate it.

240
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:43,963
What?

241
00:13:45,506 --> 00:13:47,049
I need a reason.

242
00:13:47,842 --> 00:13:50,303
And don't say money.
Why do this?

243
00:13:50,511 --> 00:13:52,638
Why not do it?

244
00:13:57,768 --> 00:13:59,627
Because yesterday I walked
out of the joint after...

245
00:13:59,652 --> 00:14:01,630
...losing four years of my life,

246
00:14:01,631 --> 00:14:04,218
and you're cold-decking
Teen Beat cover boys.

247
00:14:06,861 --> 00:14:09,030
Because the house always wins.

248
00:14:09,238 --> 00:14:12,408
You play long enough, never changing
stakes, the house takes you.

249
00:14:12,617 --> 00:14:15,926
Unless, when that perfect hand
comes around, you bet big.

250
00:14:15,927 --> 00:14:17,831
And then you take the house.

251
00:14:21,092 --> 00:14:22,516
You're been practicing
that speech,

252
00:14:22,541 --> 00:14:23,654
- haven't you?
- A little bit. Did I rush it?

253
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:25,504
- It felt like I rushed it.
- No, it was good. I like it.

254
00:14:25,529 --> 00:14:27,163
The Teen Beat thing was harsh.

255
00:14:30,801 --> 00:14:32,970
I wonder what Reuben will say.

256
00:14:34,013 --> 00:14:36,558
REUBEN: You're out
of your damn minds!

257
00:14:36,582 --> 00:14:38,082
Are you listening to me?

258
00:14:38,476 --> 00:14:40,061
You're both of you nuts!

259
00:14:40,311 --> 00:14:45,691
I know more about casino security
than any man alive. I invented it.

260
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,777
And it cannot be beaten.

261
00:14:47,985 --> 00:14:51,155
They got cameras, they got
watchers, they got locks...

262
00:14:51,364 --> 00:14:53,199
...they got timers,
they got vaults.

263
00:14:53,533 --> 00:14:56,994
They got enough armed
personnel to occupy Paris!

264
00:14:58,037 --> 00:15:00,248
Okay, bad example.

265
00:15:00,498 --> 00:15:02,208
It's never been tried.

266
00:15:02,309 --> 00:15:05,688
Oh, It's never been tried!
It's been tried.

267
00:15:05,689 --> 00:15:07,839
A few guys even came close.

268
00:15:08,047 --> 00:15:11,759
You know the three most successful
robberies in the history of Vegas?

269
00:15:11,968 --> 00:15:13,970
<i>REUBEN: Number three,
the bronze medal.</i>

270
00:15:14,178 --> 00:15:17,306
<i>Pencilneck grabs a
lockbox at the Horseshoe.</i>

271
00:15:17,315 --> 00:15:19,809
MAN: Hey, Hey. Grab that guy.
Grab the the suit!

272
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:24,355
<i>He got two steps closer to the door
than any living soul before him.</i>

273
00:15:24,564 --> 00:15:25,731
MAN: Hey, leave the money!

274
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:27,900
Second most successful robbery,

275
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:32,613
<i>The Flamingo in '71 . This guy
actually tasted fresh oxygen...</i>

276
00:15:32,622 --> 00:15:34,666
<i>...before they grabbed him.</i>

277
00:15:35,408 --> 00:15:39,912
<i>Of course, he was breathing out
of a hose for the next three weeks.</i>

278
00:15:40,121 --> 00:15:41,914
<i>Goddamn hippie.</i>

279
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:44,980
And the closest any
man has ever come...

280
00:15:44,981 --> 00:15:47,403
...to robbing a Las Vegas casino,

281
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,965
<i>was outside of Caesars in '87.</i>

282
00:15:51,966 --> 00:15:53,134
<i>He came...</i>

283
00:15:54,135 --> 00:15:55,469
<i>...he grabbed...</i>

284
00:15:56,345 --> 00:15:58,181
<i>...they conquered.</i>

285
00:16:03,352 --> 00:16:07,982
But what am I saying?
You guys are pros. The best.

286
00:16:08,316 --> 00:16:11,277
I'm sure you can make
it out of the casino.

287
00:16:11,485 --> 00:16:13,738
Of course, lest we forget...

288
00:16:13,946 --> 00:16:15,663
...once you're out
the front door,

289
00:16:15,764 --> 00:16:18,943
you're still in the middle
of the fucking desert!

290
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:21,162
You're right. He's right.

291
00:16:21,317 --> 00:16:22,317
Reuben, you're right.

292
00:16:22,318 --> 00:16:24,165
Our eyes were bigger
than our stomachs.

293
00:16:24,373 --> 00:16:26,235
That's exactly what it is.
Pure ego.

294
00:16:26,236 --> 00:16:27,743
REUBEN: Yeah, Yeah,
Yeah, blah, blah. Blah.

295
00:16:27,793 --> 00:16:30,755
- Thank you for lunch.
- The nicoise was delicious.

296
00:16:30,963 --> 00:16:32,418
Sorry we bother you.

297
00:16:32,419 --> 00:16:34,133
Look, we all go way back and...

298
00:16:34,342 --> 00:16:36,745
...I owe you from the thing
with the guy in the place.

299
00:16:36,746 --> 00:16:38,039
...and I'll never forget it.

300
00:16:38,054 --> 00:16:40,515
- It was our pleasure.
- I'd never been to Belize.

301
00:16:40,723 --> 00:16:42,348
Give Dominic your addresses,

302
00:16:42,349 --> 00:16:45,686
I got some remaindered
furniture I wanna send you.

303
00:16:46,854 --> 00:16:49,051
Look just out of curiosity,

304
00:16:49,052 --> 00:16:52,777
which casinos did you
geniuses pick to rob?

305
00:16:54,028 --> 00:16:57,365
DANNY: The Bellagio, the
Mirage and the MGM Grand.

306
00:16:59,283 --> 00:17:01,920
Those are Terry
Benedict's casinos.

307
00:17:02,828 --> 00:17:05,206
- Is that right?
- That's right.

308
00:17:05,998 --> 00:17:07,675
You guys,

309
00:17:09,001 --> 00:17:11,754
What do you got against
Terry Benedict?

310
00:17:12,004 --> 00:17:14,933
What do you have against
him, that's the question.

311
00:17:15,842 --> 00:17:20,596
He torpedoed my casino.
Muscled me out.

312
00:17:20,805 --> 00:17:23,087
Now he's gonna blow
it up next month to...

313
00:17:23,088 --> 00:17:26,143
...make way for
some monstrosity.

314
00:17:26,477 --> 00:17:28,433
Don't think I don't see
what you're doing.

315
00:17:28,434 --> 00:17:30,122
What are we doing, Reuben?

316
00:17:31,232 --> 00:17:35,945
If you're gonna steal from Terry
Benedict, you better goddamn know.

317
00:17:36,195 --> 00:17:38,409
This sorta thing used
to be civilized.

318
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:40,283
You'd hit a guy,
he'd whack you. Done.

319
00:17:40,533 --> 00:17:42,368
But with Benedict,

320
00:17:43,369 --> 00:17:47,248
At the end of this, he'd better
not know you're involved.

321
00:17:47,256 --> 00:17:49,290
Not know your names,
or think you're dead.

322
00:17:49,291 --> 00:17:52,095
Because he'll kill you, then
he'll go to work on you.

323
00:17:53,254 --> 00:17:56,867
That's why we have to be
very careful, very precise.

324
00:17:56,891 --> 00:17:58,503
Hmm. Well-funded.

325
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:01,396
Yeah, you gotta be nuts, too.

326

which anybody tell you
takes more than a smile.

510
00:31:21,562 --> 00:31:24,065
Next, through these doors.

511
00:31:24,315 --> 00:31:28,778
Each of which requires a different
six-digit code changed every 12 hours.

512
00:31:28,986 --> 00:31:32,698
Past those, lies the elevator.
And this is where it gets tricky.

513
00:31:32,907 --> 00:31:36,167
The elevator won't move without
authorized fingerprint identifications.

514
00:31:36,168 --> 00:31:37,604
<i>Which we can't fake.</i>

515
00:31:37,628 --> 00:31:39,110
And vocal confirmations from...

516
00:31:39,111 --> 00:31:43,018
both the security system within
the Bellagio and the vault below.

517
00:31:43,042 --> 00:31:44,551
- Which we won't get.
- Furthermore...

518
00:31:44,552 --> 00:31:47,797
The elevator shaft is rigged
with motion detectors.

519
00:31:47,805 --> 00:31:49,579
Meaning if we manually
override the lift,

520
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:52,844
the shaft's exit will lock down
automatically and we'll be trapped.

521
00:31:53,094 --> 00:31:56,472
Now, once we get down the shaft,
though, then it's a piece of cake.

522
00:31:56,722 --> 00:32:00,127
Just, two more guards
with Uzis and...

523
00:32:00,151 --> 00:32:04,063
...the most elaborate vault
door ever conceived by man.

524
00:32:04,689 --> 00:32:06,357

VIRGIL: You said something
about good news.

531
00:32:19,829 --> 00:32:23,207
DANNY: Yeah. The Nevada Gaming
Commission stipulates that...

532
00:32:23,208 --> 00:32:25,736
...a casino must hold
in reserve enough cash,

533
00:32:25,737 --> 00:32:28,096
to cover every chip
at play on its floor.

534
00:32:28,212 --> 00:32:32,049
That means on a weekday, by law,
it has to carry anywhere...

535
00:32:32,258 --> 00:32:35,136
...between $60 and $70
million in cash and coin.

536
00:32:35,344 --> 00:32:39,515
On the weekend, between $80 and
$90 million. On a fight night...

537
00:32:39,724 --> 00:32:42,810
...like the one two weeks from tonight,
the night we're robbing it.

538
00:32:43,019 --> 00:32:46,355
$150 million, without
breaking a sweat.

539
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:49,740

548

source within its blast radius.

920
00:57:48,316 --> 00:57:50,938
That tends not to matter in most
cases because the nuclear weapon

use to destroys everything you
might need power for anyway.

<i>I would.</i>

I'm gonna be supremely
disappointed.

1409
01:34:51,971 --> 01:34:55,168

...rest assured, we're not gonna
hand you over to the police.

1411

is this. "Run and hide."
