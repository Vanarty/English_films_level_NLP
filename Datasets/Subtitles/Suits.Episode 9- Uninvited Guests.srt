00:07:45,232 --> 00:07:48,033
- Let me
tell you something, jack.

173
00:07:48,035 --> 00:07:50,135
When the dust settles,

174
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:53,138
You're gonna be the one
begging for a place,

175
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:57,142
And i'm gonna be the one
recommending they throw you out.

176
00:08:02,883 --> 00:08:05,884
- You really should try
one of those standing desks.

177
00:08:05,886 --> 00:08:09,120
It's better on the back
for a woman of your age.

178
00:08:09,122 --> 00:08:12,123
- This is a standing desk
for a man of your height.

179
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:14,159
- Nice to see you, jessica.
- No, it isn't.

180
00:08:14,161 --> 00:08:15,577
And the last time i saw you,

181
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:16,994
I told you to
stay the hell away from my firm.

182
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:18,597
- And a good lawyer
puts aside their feelings

183
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:19,998
When there's money on the table.

184
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,600
- Oh, cut the shit, daniel.
Second you get your foot

185
00:08:21,602 --> 00:08:22,767
In the door,
you'll start hatching a plan

186
00:08:22,769 --> 00:08:24,603
To put me on the street.
- You're right.

187
00:08:24,605 --> 00:08:25,904
But thanks to you,
the partners will put you

188
00:08:25,906 --> 00:08:27,506
On the street anyway.

189
00:08:27,508 --> 00:08:28,807
- What the hell
are you talking about?

190
00:08:28,809 --> 00:08:30,175
- The client i was willing
to share with you

191
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:32,210
Is looking
to make numerous acquisitions,

192
00:08:32,212 --> 00:08:34,946
And those acquisitions
would have been new clients

193
00:08:34,948 --> 00:08:36,648
For you too.

194
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:39,117
Instead, we're going to start
targeting your clients

195
00:08:39,119 --> 00:08:42,020
As acquisitions,
and everyone we close

196
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:45,590
Leaves you and comes
right over to me.

197
00:08:45,592 --> 00:08:48,293
And now all the partners
will know why it's happening.

198
00:08:48,295 --> 00:08:52,063
- And your puppet, jack soloff,
tells the partners,

199
00:08:52,065 --> 00:08:55,166
"if we let you back,
the bleeding stops."

200
00:08:55,168 --> 00:08:57,102
- Which is why i'm here.

201
00:08:57,104 --> 00:08:58,537
To thank you.

202
00:08:58,539 --> 00:09:00,739
It would be so much
less delightful

203
00:09:00,741 --> 00:09:05,911
If you had just said yes
right away.

204
00:09:05,913 --> 00:09:08,046
- Well the least you could do
is tell me your first target.

205
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:10,882
- I'll give you a hint.

206
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:14,953
It's one that's gonna hit you
right where it hurts.

207
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:21,026
- I can't believe that
in a couple of months

208
00:09:21,028 --> 00:09:22,327
We'll be back here
for your wedding.

209
00:09:22,329 --> 00:09:24,062
- I know, it's amazing.
I can't believe

210
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:25,630
How much we have left to do.

211
00:09:25,632 --> 00:09:26,731
- Mmm, speaking of which.

212
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:28,934
- Mm-hmm?

213
00:09:28,936 --> 00:09:30,135
What's this?

214
00:09:30,137 --> 00:09:31,803
- Your wedding announcement
for "the times."

215
00:09:31,805 --> 00:09:34,739
I know that you're busy,
so i took the liberty

216
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:35,907
Of writing it up.

217
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:37,142
- Wedding announcement?
- Yes.

218
00:09:37,144 --> 00:09:38,743
- Um, mom, i don't think that...

219
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:40,412
- I left a couple
of things blank.

220
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:42,080
I wasn't sure
where mike went for undergrad.

221
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:44,282
Was it cornell or columbia?

222
00:09:44,284 --> 00:09:46,851
Oh, and was he
on the harvard law review?

223
00:09:46,853 --> 00:09:48,420
And they're gonna want
a picture of the two of you.

224
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:50,301
I was thinking maybe
the central park boathouse?

225
00:09:53,026 --> 00:09:54,926
- We're not doing
an announcement.

226
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:56,094
- What?

227
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:57,295
- Mike and i,
we're not interested in this.

228
00:09:57,297 --> 00:09:58,663
- [scoffs]

229
00:09:58,665 --> 00:10:00,031
I don't understand.

230
00:10:00,033 --> 00:10:01,199
When you read your cousin
nicole's announcement,

231
00:10:01,201 --> 00:10:03,068
You didn't have
a problem with it.

232
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:03,969
- 'cause something like this
is right for nicole.

233
00:10:03,971 --> 00:10:06,304
It's not right for me.

234
00:10:06,306 --> 00:10:08,239
- You mean it's not
right for mike?

235
00:10:08,241 --> 00:10:10,642
- Oh, come on, mom.
What are you talking about?

236
00:10:10,644 --> 00:10:11,743
- Two years ago,
you wouldn't have had a problem

237
00:10:11,745 --> 00:10:12,978
With something like this.

238
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,245
- Well, it's not two years ago,

239
00:10:14,247 --> 00:10:16,047
And this is how we both feel.

240
00:10:16,049 --> 00:10:19,684
So i'm just asking you
to respect my wishes

241
00:10:19,686 --> 00:10:25,991
Because we have
so much more to go over, okay?

242
00:10:25,993 --> 00:10:27,225
<i>- I'm telling you
it's cutie pie cosmetics.</i>

243
00:10:27,227 --> 00:10:28,760
Joan's ready to retire.

244
00:10:28,762 --> 00:10:30,261
- No one gives a shit
about joan walsh's business.

245
00:10:30,263 --> 00:10:31,796
It's nader communications.

246
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:33,064
<i>- Why, because they're
you're client?</i>

247
00:10:33,066 --> 00:10:34,165
- No, because
they were jack's client

248
00:10:34,167 --> 00:10:35,834
And now they're my client.

249
00:10:35,836 --> 00:10:37,269
- So this is all about you?

250
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:38,703
- Louis, calm down.
- No, this is all about you.

251
00:10:38,705 --> 00:10:39,971
- You know what?
You're the one who gave

252
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:41,406
Hardman the opening he needed.

253
00:10:41,407 --> 00:10:42,840
- <i>Did you hear what i just said?</i>
- Excuse me?

254
00:10:42,843 --> 00:10:44,042
- Yeah, you heard me.
This wouldn't be happening

255
00:10:44,044 --> 00:10:45,710
If you didn't try to suspend me.

256
00:10:45,712 --> 00:10:46,862
- After you punched me
in the face.

257
00:10:46,863 --> 00:10:48,013
If you really want
to know who's at fault here,

258
00:10:48,015 --> 00:10:49,014
Why don't you take a look
in the mirror?

259
00:10:49,016 --> 00:10:50,682
<i>- That's enough.</i>

260
00:10:50,684 --> 00:10:52,250
<i>This is exactly
what hardman wants.</i>

261
00:10:52,252 --> 00:10:54,653
He's trying to get us
to turn on each other.

262
00:10:54,655 --> 00:10:56,988
Well, the fight is out there,
not in here,

263
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:59,924
And we have to figure out
who hardman's target is.

264
00:11:01,128 --> 00:11:02,444
Where the hell are you going?

265
00:11:02,445 --> 00:11:03,761
- You're right,
the fight is out there,

266
00:11:03,764 --> 00:11:07,032
But jack soloff's in here.

267
00:11:07,034 --> 00:11:09,000
- You think it's a good idea
to let him go after jack?

268
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:10,802
- What's he gonna do?
Make him less on our side?

269
00:11:10,804 --> 00:11:12,671
- [sighs] you're right.

270
00:11:12,673 --> 00:11:14,305
There's more important things
to do here anyway.

271
00:11:14,307 --> 00:11:15,874
- Yeah, and number one
on the list

272
00:11:15,876 --> 00:11:17,776
Is if you think that hardman's
really going after

273
00:11:17,778 --> 00:11:19,911
Nader communications,
then we need to get over there

274
00:11:19,913 --> 00:11:21,480
And warn them.

275
00:11:21,481 --> 00:11:23,048
- It's not nader,
it's mckernon motors.

276
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:24,082
- It can't be mckernon.
They're too small.

277
00:11:24,084 --> 00:11:25,417
- Not since we did
that battery deal.

278
00:11:25,419 --> 00:11:26,885
And i know
what you're gonna say,

279
00:11:26,886 --> 00:11:28,352
"avery mckernon's estate
still owns too much

280
00:11:28,355 --> 00:11:30,889
Of the stock," but not anymore.

281
00:11:30,891 --> 00:11:31,956
- Who bought it?

282
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:33,058
- It doesn't matter
who bought it.

283
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:34,710
It matters
who the attorney of record is.

284
00:11:34,711 --> 00:11:36,361
- Let me guess, daniel hardman.
- Exactly.

285
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:38,830
- Goddamn it.

286
00:11:38,832 --> 00:11:40,065
- Harvey, what are you doing?

287
00:11:40,067 --> 00:11:41,466
- I'm going
to see dominic barone.

288
00:11:41,468 --> 00:11:43,435
- Well, then i'm going with you.
- No, you're not.

289
00:11:43,437 --> 00:11:44,969
They're my oldest client,

290
00:11:44,971 --> 00:11:46,905
And this is something
i have to do.

291
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:48,840
- Harvey, this is a client
that you gave to me and louis.

292
00:11:48,842 --> 00:11:50,008
- Yeah, and you were
smart enough

293
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:51,476
To figure out
they were the target.

294
00:11:51,478 --> 00:11:53,011
Now i need you to use that brain

295
00:11:53,013 --> 00:11:56,047
To start figuring out
how we're gonna get out of this.

296
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:57,415
- What are you gonna do?

297
00:11:57,417 --> 00:11:59,184
- I'm gonna look dominic barone
in the eye

298
00:11:59,186 --> 00:12:02,087
And tell him i'm the reason
this is happening.

299
00:12:06,026 --> 00:12:06,257
.

300
00:12:06,259 --> 00:12:08,026
- Jack, i need to talk to you.

301
00:12:08,028 --> 00:12:09,060
- You can save your breath,
louis.

302
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:10,462
I know what you're here to say.

303
00:12:10,464 --> 00:12:11,996
You're here to tell me
not to go against

304
00:12:11,998 --> 00:12:14,799
Your precious
harvey and jessica.

305
00:12:14,801 --> 00:12:16,935
- No, i'm here to tell you
that you have no idea

306
00:12:16,937 --> 00:12:18,470
Who you're in bed with.

307
00:12:18,472 --> 00:12:21,506
- Well, i appreciate
your concern for my well-being,

308
00:12:21,508 --> 00:12:24,242
But i can handle myself.
- No you can't.

309
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:25,844
- What difference does it make,
louis?

310
00:12:25,846 --> 00:12:27,846
It's too late.
- It's not too late.

311
00:12:27,848 --> 00:12:29,414
- You think if
i suddenly abandon daniel,

312
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:31,950
Jessica's just gonna welcome
me back with open arms?

313
00:12:31,952 --> 00:12:34,119
- Yes, you don't know
how forgiving she can be.

314
00:12:34,121 --> 00:12:35,987
- I trust her.
The only thing she's going

315
00:12:35,989 --> 00:12:37,856
To forgive me with
is a knife in the back.

316
00:12:37,858 --> 00:12:39,424
- Jack, listen to me.

317
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:42,427
Daniel hardman
treated me like a son.

318
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:45,063
He promoted me
to senior partner,

319
00:12:45,065 --> 00:12:46,431
Used me to take over the firm.

320
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:49,400
After he lost power,
he turns around

321
00:12:49,402 --> 00:12:51,903
And slaps me
with a sexual harassment claim.

322
00:12:51,905 --> 00:12:53,204
- I know.
Monica eaton.

323
00:12:53,206 --> 00:12:59,210
- But what you don't know
is that it was bullshit.

324
00:12:59,212 --> 00:13:03,114
He betrayed me.

325
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:06,050
Humiliated me.

326
00:13:06,052 --> 00:13:07,452
And after i finally
confronted him about it,

327
00:13:07,454 --> 00:13:11,089
He tells me...

328
00:13:11,091 --> 00:13:14,292
That i got what i always wanted.

329
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:16,895
So, jack, believe me,
if you think this man

330
00:13:16,897 --> 00:13:20,131
Cares about you, he doesn't.

331
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:21,800
- I know what kind of man
he is, louis.

332
00:13:21,802 --> 00:13:24,035
- Then why are you siding
with him?

333
00:13:24,037 --> 00:13:26,004
- I'll tell you why.

334
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:27,972
He promised to do something
jessica never would.

335
00:13:27,974 --> 00:13:29,073
Put my name on the wall.

336
00:13:29,075 --> 00:13:31,109
- What if she would?

337
00:13:31,111 --> 00:13:32,277
- You're not in reality.

338
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:34,078
- Jack, she did it for me.

339
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,181
- Even if i wanted
to go with you, i couldn't.

340
00:13:36,183 --> 00:13:38,049
- He's got something on you,
doesn't he?

341
00:13:38,051 --> 00:13:39,984
- This conversation is over.

342
00:13:49,429 --> 00:13:51,129
- Harvey, what the hell?

343
00:13:51,131 --> 00:13:52,831
I just to notification
of a tender offer.

344
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:54,132
They're coming after my company.

345
00:13:54,134 --> 00:13:55,233
- I know, that's why i'm here.

346
00:13:55,235 --> 00:13:56,334
- So they sent
the big guns to fight

347
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:58,069
Because it's a hostile takeover?

348
00:13:58,071 --> 00:13:59,604
- I'm not here
because it's a hostile takeover.

349
00:13:59,606 --> 00:14:02,006
I'm here because
this whole thing is my fault.

350
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:03,274
- What do you mean your fault?

351
00:14:03,275 --> 00:14:04,541
- The reason you're
in the crosshairs is because

352
00:14:04,544 --> 00:14:07,145
Daniel hardman
has a vendetta against me.

353
00:14:07,147 --> 00:14:08,179
- You're telling me
we just closed a deal

354
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:10,215
That ensures
this company's future

355
00:14:10,217 --> 00:14:11,983
And you put it in jeopardy
because you pissed off

356
00:14:11,985 --> 00:14:13,118
Your former partner?

357
00:14:13,119 --> 00:14:14,252
- Yes, that's
what i'm telling you.

358
00:14:14,254 --> 00:14:16,020
- God damn it.

359
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:17,322
- Well what do you
want me to do, dominic?

360
00:14:17,324 --> 00:14:19,591
- I want you to stop being
an asshole to people.

361
00:14:19,593 --> 00:14:22,093
- It's too late for that.

362
00:14:22,095 --> 00:14:25,163
But it may not be too late
for this.

363
00:14:25,165 --> 00:14:26,998
Drop us as your attorneys.

364
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,066
- What?

365
00:14:28,068 --> 00:14:30,301
- As long as
you're connected to us,

366
00:14:30,303 --> 00:14:32,036
There's gonna be
a target on your back.

367
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:34,138
You let us go,
there's a chance it goes away.

368
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:35,373
- Harvey.

369
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:36,607
If i was just gonna
cut you loose because

370
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:38,209
Someone hates you,
i wouldn't have hired you

371
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:40,511
In the fist place,
because we both know

372
00:14:40,513 --> 00:14:43,014
I used to hate you.

373
00:14:43,016 --> 00:14:45,016
- Thanks, dominic.

374
00:14:45,018 --> 00:14:46,551
- So what are we gonna do?
- I'll let you know.

375
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:48,019
But i'll tell you this:

376
00:14:48,021 --> 00:14:51,055
They want a war, they got a war.

377
00:14:56,129 --> 00:14:58,162
- Hey, rach, do you have
that neilson brief for louis

378
00:14:58,164 --> 00:14:58,997
From last month?

379
00:14:58,999 --> 00:15:00,531
- No, i don't.

380
00:15:00,533 --> 00:15:01,599
- Are you sure?
Because he keeps telling me

381
00:15:01,601 --> 00:15:02,667
That you have it.

382
00:15:02,669 --> 00:15:04,002
- And i keep telling him i don't

383
00:15:04,004 --> 00:15:05,237
And i have more
important things to do

384
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:06,471
Than sit around
and answer the same question

385
00:15:06,473 --> 00:15:08,439
Every other day.

386
00:15:08,441 --> 00:15:10,174
- And i have better things
to do with my time

387
00:15:10,176 --> 00:15:12,911
Than to be spoken to that way.

388
00:15:12,913 --> 00:15:15,213
- [sighs] i'm sorry.

389
00:15:15,215 --> 00:15:20,318
- Rachel, what's going on?

390
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,420
- I just had lunch with my mom

391
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:24,521
To talk about our wedding,
and she wants to put

392
00:15:24,524 --> 00:15:26,357
An announcement
in "the new york times."

393
00:15:26,359 --> 00:15:27,492
- Oh, my god.

394
00:15:27,494 --> 00:15:28,593
Did you tell her
that she can't do that?

395
00:15:28,595 --> 00:15:30,161
- Yeah.
I made up some story

396
00:15:30,163 --> 00:15:31,963
About it being snobby,
but donna, that's just

397
00:15:31,965 --> 00:15:33,031
The tip of the iceberg.

398
00:15:33,033 --> 00:15:34,132
- What are you talking about?

399
00:15:34,134 --> 00:15:36,100
- This is her
proposed guest list.

400
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:38,569
It is 300 people and it includes

401
00:15:38,571 --> 00:15:42,473
The attorney general
and the dean of harvard law.

402
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:46,144
What am i gonna do?

403
00:15:46,146 --> 00:15:47,078
- You're gonna tell her
that you don't want

404
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,980
A big wedding and that's that.

405
00:15:48,982 --> 00:15:50,048
- And if i do that,
she's gonna know

406
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:51,149
That something's not right.

407
00:15:51,151 --> 00:15:53,117
- Rachel, this is
the type of argument

408
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:55,286
That every mother has
with every daughter

409
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:58,156
About her wedding.

410
00:15:58,158 --> 00:16:01,292
She's never gonna think
that mike's a fraud.

411
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,434
- How'd dominic take it?
- He took it fine.

412
00:16:09,436 --> 00:16:10,601
- Good, 'cause i have a plan.

413
00:16:10,603 --> 00:16:12,103
- Let's hear it.

414
00:16:12,105 --> 00:16:13,104
- We go to the last place
they'd ever expect

415
00:16:13,106 --> 00:16:14,172
And we offer to merge.
- Where?

416
00:16:14,174 --> 00:16:15,239
- Fletcher engines.

417
00:16:15,241 --> 00:16:16,874
- Are you crazy?

418
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:18,508
We go to fletcher,
they're gonna kick dominic out,

419
00:16:18,511 --> 00:16:20,078
Jack gains power.

420
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,512
Might as well have
let mckernon get bought out

421
00:16:21,514 --> 00:16:23,147
In the first place.

422
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:24,482
- Then the only other option
that's even remotely possible

423
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:26,651
Is we take them private.

424
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:29,988
- That actually might work.

425
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:31,289
Come to think of it,
why the hell didn't you

426
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:32,991
Just say that to me
in the first place?

427
00:16:32,993 --> 00:16:35,360
- Because i knew you'd shit on
whatever my first idea was

428
00:16:35,362 --> 00:16:36,761
And that you'd be open
to the backup.

429
00:16:36,763 --> 00:16:38,296
- You're telling me
you set up a straw man idea

430
00:16:38,298 --> 00:16:40,631
To manipulate me
into liking your real idea?

431
00:16:40,633 --> 00:16:42,300
- Yep.
- How long you been doing that?

432
00:16:42,302 --> 00:16:43,768
- Peabody versus danthorpe.

433
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:46,070
- Son of a bitch.

434
00:16:46,072 --> 00:16:47,422
All right, smart guy.

435
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:48,773
Now where are we gonna get
the money for the equity?

436
00:16:48,775 --> 00:16:50,541
- I'll tell you where.
Sidwell and gianopolous.

437
00:16:50,543 --> 00:16:52,076
<i>- Is that another
straw man idea?</i>

438
00:16:52,078 --> 00:16:53,928
Because you'll never get
the two of them

439
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:55,779
To go in on a deal together.
They hate each other.

440
00:16:55,782 --> 00:16:57,582
- Oh, those two hating
each other is exactly

441
00:16:57,584 --> 00:17:00,018
What i'm counting on.

442
00:17:03,089 --> 00:17:05,189
<i>- Hey, mom.</i>
- Oh, rachel!

443
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:06,724
<i>You're just in time.</i>

444
00:17:06,726 --> 00:17:09,060
The caterer dropped off
some samples.

445
00:17:09,062 --> 00:17:11,029
I was just about to try them,
but it'll be much more fun

446
00:17:11,031 --> 00:17:12,096
If we do this together.

447
00:17:12,098 --> 00:17:13,698
- Okay, mom,
but before you pout that.

448
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:16,100
- I don't think that
the crostini travels very well.

449
00:17:16,102 --> 00:17:18,236
- Mom, please.

450
00:17:18,238 --> 00:17:20,438
I know that you have given this
a lot of thought,

451
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:23,041
But i need to talk to you
about the size of the wedding.

452
00:17:23,043 --> 00:17:25,376
It's way too big.

453
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:27,278
- I have given this
a lot of thought,

454
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,213
And 30 people at a wedding

455
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:31,449
Isn't going to get
a chef like this.

456
00:17:31,451 --> 00:17:32,583
- Right, but i'm not
having a wedding

457
00:17:32,585 --> 00:17:33,851
Based on the chef,

458
00:17:33,852 --> 00:17:35,118
And i'm not here
to talk about the menu.

459
00:17:35,121 --> 00:17:39,157
I'm here to talk about
the guest list.

460
00:17:39,159 --> 00:17:40,725
- Rachel, did i ever tell you
what your father did

461
00:17:40,727 --> 00:17:43,194
Three weeks
before we got married?

462
00:17:43,196 --> 00:17:46,130
Bought two tickets to bermuda
and said we're eloping.

463
00:17:46,132 --> 00:17:47,632
And he did that
because he didn't want

464
00:17:47,634 --> 00:17:49,167
To deal with my mother.

465
00:17:49,169 --> 00:17:51,469
But you know what stopped me?

466
00:17:51,471 --> 00:17:53,805
I knew that i would regret
doing that to my mom

467
00:17:53,807 --> 00:17:55,406
For the rest of my life.

468
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:58,076
- But i told you
this isn't about mike,

469
00:17:58,078 --> 00:17:59,510
And it isn't about eloping.

470
00:17:59,512 --> 00:18:01,712
This is just about
me not wanting to get married

471
00:18:01,714 --> 00:18:04,615
In front of hundreds of people
that i don't know.

472
00:18:04,617 --> 00:18:05,817
- What's going on here, rachel?

473
00:18:05,819 --> 00:18:07,318
<i>- I'm telling you
what's going on.</i>

474
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,419
You're just not hearing me.
I don't want this big

475
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:09,821
Of a wedding.

476
00:18:09,823 --> 00:18:12,223
- I'm hearing you,
but i know my own daughter,

477
00:18:12,224 --> 00:18:14,624
And there is something
that you're not telling me.

478
00:18:14,627 --> 00:18:15,943
- Okay, mom.

479
00:18:15,944 --> 00:18:17,260
Yes, there is something
that i'm not telling you,

480
00:18:17,263 --> 00:18:20,198
And that's because
it's really hard for me

481
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:23,134
To say it.

482
00:18:23,136 --> 00:18:27,872
You keep thinking
that this is about mike.

483
00:18:27,874 --> 00:18:29,273
Well, it's not.

484
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:31,742
This is about you
not accepting that it's

485
00:18:31,744 --> 00:18:34,412
My wedding and it's not yours.

486
00:18:34,414 --> 00:18:35,680
- Rachel.

487
00:18:35,682 --> 00:18:38,116
- And if you can't
figure out a way to accept that,

488
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:40,551
Then i think maybe
we will have to elope.

489
00:18:49,896 --> 00:18:50,884
.

490
00:18:50,885 --> 00:18:51,873
- Jessica, can i talk to you
for a second?

491
00:18:51,874 --> 00:18:52,862
- Can it wait till tomorrow?

492
00:18:52,866 --> 00:18:54,298
- No.

493
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,800
I think we should consider
promoting jack soloff

494
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:57,168
To name partner.

495
00:18:57,170 --> 00:19:00,171
- Are you crazy?

496
00:19:00,173 --> 00:19:01,339
- Jessica, we are under attack.

497
00:19:01,341 --> 00:19:02,707
- And you're asking me
to reward our enemy.

498
00:19:02,709 --> 00:19:04,475
- No, i'm asking you
to bring our enemy's right hand

499
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:05,776
Over to our side.

500
00:19:05,778 --> 00:19:07,378
- Louis, it's late.
I'm going home.

501
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:08,880
- Jessica, you have to
listen to me, please.

502
00:19:08,882 --> 00:19:13,351
Hardman's got something on him.

503
00:19:13,353 --> 00:19:16,754
- Has what on him?

504
00:19:16,756 --> 00:19:18,556
- I don't know,
but until two months ago,

505
00:19:18,558 --> 00:19:20,158
The only thing we knew
about jack soloff

506
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,360
Is that he bills more hours
than anyone but me.

507
00:19:22,362 --> 00:19:23,561
So, what, you think
he just woke up one day

508
00:19:23,563 --> 00:19:25,429
And became mastermind
of a palace coup?

509
00:19:25,431 --> 00:19:27,231
- The question isn't
who's in charge between

510
00:19:27,233 --> 00:19:29,834
Those two,
it's whether jack is a volunteer

511
00:19:29,836 --> 00:19:31,169
Or a conscription.

512
00:19:31,171 --> 00:19:32,470
- I'm telling you,

00:25:49,598 --> 00:25:51,148
I had to lean in.
It's called committing.

683
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:53,050
- Then how about you commit
to buying the next round

684
00:25:53,052 --> 00:25:53,984
For a change?

685
00:25:53,986 --> 00:25:56,053
- I'd love to, but i can't.

686
00:25:56,055 --> 00:25:57,922
I got to go meet rachel
at her mom's.

I'd love to join you,

689

But i'd rather
have a prostate exam.

690
00:26:03,095 --> 00:26:04,261

You're leaning in.

00:26:05,798 --> 00:26:06,931

00:26:20,329 --> 00:26:22,613
- Just wondering what color
to paint the walls.

700
00:26:22,615 --> 00:26:25,049
I've never been partial to red.

Why don't you go back

It'll be

Your offer falls through.

- Well, then lucky for me,
my client's japanese

713
00:26:51,711 --> 00:26:55,012
And the dollar just
took a dive against the yen.

And another one and another one,

There is to know

From his pirate beard
to his stupid pen

00:27:45,798 --> 00:27:47,865

something i never

742
00:28:06,452 --> 00:28:08,919
Thought i would.
- What?

743
00:28:08,921 --> 00:28:10,888
- The night that harvey and mike
put it together

744
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:14,024
About daniel and cm,

745
00:28:14,026 --> 00:28:16,126
They got stoned first.

746
00:28:16,128 --> 00:28:17,511
- What?

747
00:28:17,512 --> 00:28:18,895
- They thought you and daniel
had them and they were screwed

748
00:28:18,898 --> 00:28:20,964
And they figured,
"what the hell?"

749
00:28:20,966 --> 00:28:23,333
So they bought some marijuana
and they got high.

750
00:28:23,335 --> 00:28:25,169
- Are you suggesting
we take the pot?

751
00:28:25,171 --> 00:28:26,336
- Worked for them.

752
00:28:26,338 --> 00:28:27,705
- Well, it's not
gonna work for me.

753
00:28:27,707 --> 00:28:28,823
- Louis...
- Donna look at me.

754
00:28:28,824 --> 00:28:29,940
Do i look like someone
who needs to be hungry

755
00:28:29,942 --> 00:28:31,075
And paranoid?
- Relax.

756
00:28:31,077 --> 00:28:32,560
It was just a suggestion.

757
00:28:32,561 --> 00:28:34,044
- Well it was
a stupid god damn suggestion,

758
00:28:34,046 --> 00:28:36,046
And if that's all you have,
just walk you ass out of here.

759
00:28:36,048 --> 00:28:39,049
- Louis, what is going on?
Why are you so angry at me?

760
00:28:39,051 --> 00:28:40,317
- I'm not angry at you.

761
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:43,087
I'm angry at myself.
- Louis.

762
00:28:43,089 --> 00:28:44,755
- After the vote,
harvey told me it was my fault

763
00:28:44,757 --> 00:28:47,458
And you want to know what?
He's right.

764
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:49,993
- Harvey says a lot of things.

765
00:28:49,995 --> 00:28:52,463
- You told me too.
- What?

766
00:28:52,465 --> 00:28:54,765
- This whole thing started
because i told jack

767
00:28:54,767 --> 00:28:56,200
That he could
bring up harvey's compensation

768
00:28:56,202 --> 00:28:59,103
For a vote,
and you told me not to.

769
00:28:59,105 --> 00:29:02,005
- Well, then maybe
it's my fault too.

770
00:29:02,007 --> 00:29:04,108
Because this whole thing
really started when you tried

771
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:08,212
To make things right with harvey
for me coming to work for you.

772
00:29:08,214 --> 00:29:11,115
- Donna, are you saying
that you regret coming to me?

773
00:29:11,117 --> 00:29:13,083
- No, louis.
I'm saying maybe

774
00:29:13,085 --> 00:29:16,053
I had a hand in this too.

775
00:29:16,055 --> 00:29:17,221
- What do we do now?

776
00:29:17,223 --> 00:29:19,056
- We keep looking together.

777
00:29:19,058 --> 00:29:22,292
And if we can't find anything,
then we tell jessica the truth.

778
00:29:28,134 --> 00:29:30,968
- Hey.
- Laura, hi, how are you?

779
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:32,336
Where's rachel,
i thought for sure

780
00:29:32,338 --> 00:29:33,837
She'd beat me here.

781
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:36,540
- Uh, rachel's not coming.

782
00:29:36,542 --> 00:29:39,042
I told her i wasn't feeling well

783
00:29:39,044 --> 00:29:41,311
Because i wanted
to talk to you alone.

784
00:29:41,313 --> 00:29:43,147
- Is something wrong?

785
00:29:43,149 --> 00:29:44,414
- Yes, there is.

786
00:29:44,416 --> 00:29:46,083
Rachel told me today that

787
00:29:46,085 --> 00:29:48,085
She wants to
scale back the wedding

788
00:29:48,087 --> 00:29:52,022
And that you two are
in sync on this.

789
00:29:52,024 --> 00:29:53,290
- Sounds like
you don't believe her.

790
00:29:53,292 --> 00:29:54,558
- Found it hard enough
to believe that she wouldn't

791
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,360
Want to put an announcement
in "the times,"

792
00:29:56,362 --> 00:30:00,063
But that my little girl,
who always dreamed

793
00:30:00,065 --> 00:30:02,065
Of getting married
at the plaza hotel

794
00:30:02,067 --> 00:30:04,968
Now only wants
a handful of people there?

795
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:07,037
I'm sorry, michael.

796
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:10,107
I just don't buy it.

797
00:30:10,109 --> 00:30:12,810
This is coming from you,
isn't it?

798
00:30:12,812 --> 00:30:15,979
- You're right.

799
00:30:15,981 --> 00:30:18,115
It is.

800
00:30:18,117 --> 00:30:21,985
And i'll tell you why.

801
00:30:21,987 --> 00:30:25,956
I don't have a family.

802
00:30:25,958 --> 00:30:27,491
I don't have a lot of people
that i can invite,

803
00:30:27,493 --> 00:30:29,927
And i asked her
if we could please

804
00:30:29,929 --> 00:30:35,499
Keep the entire wedding low-key.

805
00:30:35,501 --> 00:30:37,835
And she said that
she would do that for me.

806
00:30:37,837 --> 00:30:40,170
- And i understand that.

807
00:30:40,172 --> 00:30:43,307
I think it's incredibly
sweet of her

808
00:30:43,309 --> 00:30:49,079
To be willing
to do that for you.

809
00:30:49,081 --> 00:30:53,016
But...

810
00:30:53,018 --> 00:30:55,285
If you could find it
in your heart

811
00:30:55,287 --> 00:30:57,354
To let my little girl
have the wedding

812
00:30:57,356 --> 00:31:01,158
That she's always wanted,
i am telling you,

813
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:04,027
She'll remember it
for the rest of her life.

814
00:31:14,373 --> 00:31:16,206
- Again?

815
00:31:16,208 --> 00:31:18,108
You know, i'd really prefer it
if i gave you a key

816
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:19,977
So i wouldn't have to wonder
how you keep getting in.

817
00:31:19,979 --> 00:31:22,112
- And i'd really prefer it
if you checked your cell phone

818
00:31:22,114 --> 00:31:23,247
Every once in a while
so that i wouldn't

819
00:31:23,249 --> 00:31:24,615
Have to keep doing this.

820
00:31:24,617 --> 00:31:26,216
- I have a cell phone?
- You do

821
00:31:26,218 --> 00:31:28,385
And if you'd check it,
you'd know that daniel hardman

822
00:31:28,387 --> 00:31:31,288
Topped our bid by 20%.

823
00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:33,123
- That's impossible.
- No, it isn't.

824
00:31:33,125 --> 00:31:35,058
Because the dollar
took a dive against the yen

825
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:37,895
And it turns out
his client is japanese.

826
00:31:37,897 --> 00:31:39,029
- God damn it, we are not losing

827
00:31:39,031 --> 00:31:40,353
To that son of a bitch.

828
00:31:40,354 --> 00:31:41,676
- Why the hell
did you think i'm here?

829
00:31:41,677 --> 00:31:42,999
We need to go back to
gianopolous and get more money.

830
00:31:43,002 --> 00:31:44,167
- Jessica, he's not going
to pay that much.

831
00:31:44,169 --> 00:31:45,636
No one in his right mind would.

832
00:31:45,638 --> 00:31:47,971
- Then go to somebody
who's not in his right mind,

833
00:31:47,973 --> 00:31:50,407
Because that lying bastard
isn't going to stop

834
00:31:50,409 --> 00:31:51,975
Until his name is
back up on the wall.

835
00:31:51,977 --> 00:31:54,011
- Wait a second,
the dollar took a dive

836
00:31:54,013 --> 00:31:56,980
Against the yen two weeks ago.

837
00:31:56,982 --> 00:31:58,181
- Which means there's something
else going on here.

838
00:31:58,183 --> 00:32:00,183
- Oh, i'll tell you
what's going on.

839
00:32:00,185 --> 00:32:03,487
Hardman's been playing with us
this whole time.

840
00:32:03,489 --> 00:32:05,389
- What are you saying?

841
00:32:05,391 --> 00:32:09,126
- I'm saying i need to go
see a guy about a thing.

842
00:32:17,136 --> 00:32:17,367
.

843
00:32:17,369 --> 00:32:18,669
- Hey.

844
00:32:18,671 --> 00:32:21,004
Where were you?

845
00:32:21,006 --> 00:32:22,940
- I was with you mom.
- What?

846
00:32:22,942 --> 00:32:24,608
Didn't you get the message?
She had to postpone.

847
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:27,611
- She didn't postpone, rachel.
She blindsided me.

848
00:32:27,613 --> 00:32:29,146
- What are you talking about?

849
00:32:29,148 --> 00:32:30,381
- Why didn't you tell me
you were fighting with her?

850
00:32:30,382 --> 00:32:31,615
- Because mothers and daughters
fight about weddings

851
00:32:31,617 --> 00:32:33,083
All the time.

852
00:32:33,085 --> 00:32:34,291
- But you weren't fighting
about the wedding.

853
00:32:34,292 --> 00:32:35,498
You were fighting
about my secret.

854
00:32:35,499 --> 00:32:36,705
- And what does that
have to do with anything?

855
00:32:36,706 --> 00:32:37,912
<i>- Because she doesn't
even know it.</i>

856
00:32:37,913 --> 00:32:39,119
- Because i'm trying
to protect you.

857
00:32:39,124 --> 00:32:40,691
- I understand that,
but you have to share

858
00:32:40,693 --> 00:32:42,192
These things with me.
<i>- Why?</i>

859
00:32:42,194 --> 00:32:43,961
- 'cause instead of
protecting me,

860
00:32:43,963 --> 00:32:45,228
You hung me out to dry.

861
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:46,697
- And how exactly did i do that?

862
00:32:46,699 --> 00:32:48,098
- By making it seem like
i'm the one

863
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:49,466
That's taking away
your dream wedding.

864
00:32:49,468 --> 00:32:55,172
- You are the one
taking away my dream wedding.

865
00:32:55,174 --> 00:32:56,139
- Rachel.

866
00:32:56,141 --> 00:32:57,274
<i>- I'm sorry.</i>

867
00:32:57,276 --> 00:32:58,408
It's just, it's a lot,

868
00:32:58,410 --> 00:33:00,611
And she wanted
to make this announcement

869
00:33:00,612 --> 00:33:02,813
In "the new york times"
and had this huge guest list

870
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:05,015
And the dean of harvard law
and i just...

871
00:33:05,017 --> 00:33:09,019
I don't want you to get caught.

872
00:33:09,021 --> 00:33:10,120
- You don't want me
to get caught

873
00:33:10,122 --> 00:33:12,556
Or you don't want to marry me?

874
00:33:12,558 --> 00:33:14,191
- What?

875
00:33:14,193 --> 00:33:17,160
- I went to see claire.

876
00:33:17,162 --> 00:33:20,163
I know she knows.

877
00:33:20,165 --> 00:33:21,298
And i want to know
if that made you

878
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:25,669
Have second thoughts about us.

879
00:33:25,671 --> 00:33:27,504
- [sniffs]

880
00:33:27,506 --> 00:33:29,473
You went to see claire?
Why...

881
00:33:29,475 --> 00:33:31,174
Why didn't you tell me that?

882
00:33:31,176 --> 00:33:32,642
- Because she told me
that if i really loved you,

883
00:33:32,644 --> 00:33:35,712
I wouldn't marry you.

884
00:33:35,714 --> 00:33:38,432
And i was afraid
to tell you that

885
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:41,151
Because i thought
maybe you feel the same way.

886
00:33:41,153 --> 00:33:44,654
- Well, it, um,

887
00:33:44,656 --> 00:33:48,792
It sounds like you're the one
who's having second thoughts.

888
00:33:48,794 --> 00:33:52,796
- No.

889
00:33:52,798 --> 00:33:57,234
No, i'm not
having second thoughts,

890
00:33:57,236 --> 00:34:00,203
But i do hate the idea
that i am somehow dragging

891
00:34:00,205 --> 00:34:02,539
You into something
that is gonna ruin your life.

892
00:34:02,541 --> 00:34:03,707
- You are not dragging me
into anything

893
00:34:03,709 --> 00:34:06,043
And you're not ruining my life,
mike.

894
00:34:06,045 --> 00:34:10,113
I don't care about the plaza
or who comes or...

895
00:34:10,115 --> 00:34:12,132
I don't care about any of it.

896
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:14,150
The only thing
that matters to me is that

897
00:34:14,153 --> 00:34:18,688
The man that
i'm marrying is you.

898
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:22,125
And if you take that
away from me,

899
00:34:22,127 --> 00:34:24,227
I don't...
[cries]

900
00:34:24,229 --> 00:34:26,430
- Rachel, rachel, listen,
look at me, look at me.

901
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:28,799
I'm not going anywhere.

902
00:34:28,801 --> 00:34:32,269
Okay?
We're getting married.

903
00:34:32,271 --> 00:34:34,337
And it could be
as small as possible

904
00:34:34,339 --> 00:34:37,707
With just our close friends,
okay?

905
00:34:37,709 --> 00:34:39,776
Okay?
- Okay.

906
00:34:47,086 --> 00:34:48,452
- I need to talk to you.

907
00:34:48,454 --> 00:34:50,187
- What is it, louis?

908
00:34:50,189 --> 00:34:51,822
- I couldn't find
what hardman has on jack.

909
00:34:51,824 --> 00:34:53,223
- That doesn't sound like
something you needed

910
00:34:53,225 --> 00:34:54,858
To be waiting by the elevators
to tell me.

911
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:56,793
- I've been thinking.
What if we tell him

912
00:34:56,795 --> 00:34:59,162
We'll only make him name partner
if he takes a public stand

913
00:34:59,164 --> 00:35:02,199
Against daniel first?
That way, even if he tries

914
00:35:02,201 --> 00:35:05,669
To go against it later,
it won't work.

915
00:35:05,671 --> 00:35:07,204
- Did you speak
to him about this?

916
00:35:07,206 --> 00:35:08,772
- I have.
- And?

917
00:35:08,774 --> 00:35:10,140
- He said he'll be onboard.

918
00:35:10,142 --> 00:35:11,174
And jessica,

919
00:35:11,176 --> 00:35:14,344
I believe him.

920
00:35:14,346 --> 00:35:16,813
- Then tell him to come see me
at the end of the day.

921
00:35:21,353 --> 00:35:22,786
- Hey.

922
00:35:25,891 --> 00:35:29,626
Turns out i'm getting married.

923
00:35:29,628 --> 00:35:31,194
Yeah, i know.

924
00:35:32,898 --> 00:35:36,166
I was telling my future
mother-in-law

925
00:35:36,168 --> 00:35:39,369
About how i didn't
have any friends or any family

926
00:35:39,371 --> 00:35:43,206
When i realized,

927
00:35:43,208 --> 00:35:48,211
Whatever happened between
you and me...

928
00:35:48,213 --> 00:35:51,281
You're the closest thing
to family that i have.

929
00:35:54,153 --> 00:35:56,353
So what do you say
we get together?

930
00:36:03,929 --> 00:36:08,632
- You wanted to see me?
- I did.

931
00:36:08,634 --> 00:36:12,169
- I, uh...
I just want to say,

932
00:36:12,171 --> 00:36:14,204
Based on what louis said
that you're prepared to do...

933
00:36:14,206 --> 00:36:15,939
- Louis has no idea
what i'm prepared to do

934
00:36:15,941 --> 00:36:17,574
Because the only thing
i'm prepared to do

935
00:36:17,576 --> 00:36:20,377
Is give you a chance
to come to jesus.

936
00:36:20,379 --> 00:36:21,878
And you're looking at her.

937
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,914
- Come to jesus about what?

938
00:36:23,916 --> 00:36:25,916
- Stop tap dancing, jack.

939
00:36:25,918 --> 00:36:28,552
What the hell does
daniel hardman have on you?

940
00:36:28,554 --> 00:36:30,287
- You can ask me that question
a million times.

941
00:36:30,289 --> 00:36:32,322
I'm never even going
to acknowledge its premise.

942
00:36:32,324 --> 00:36:33,924
- And you just did.

943
00:36:33,926 --> 00:36:35,892
And if it's that bad,
and daniel knows it

944
00:36:35,894 --> 00:36:37,861
And i don't,

945
00:36:37,863 --> 00:36:39,963
Then i only have one choice.

946
00:36:39,965 --> 00:36:43,233
So, what i'm prepared
to do now is this.

947
00:36:43,235 --> 00:36:47,204
Resign tonight
and i'll waive your non-compete.

948
00:36:47,206 --> 00:36:48,972
- What?
- Oh, you didn't actually think

949
00:36:48,974 --> 00:36:52,375
I was going to make you
a name partner, did you?

950
00:36:56,815 --> 00:36:58,882
- Here's my counter.

951
00:36:58,884 --> 00:37:03,887
You resign,
and i waive your non-compete.

952
00:37:06,391 --> 00:37:09,326
- You want me gone,
call for a vote.

953
00:37:09,328 --> 00:37:10,994
- You want me gone,
you do the same thing

954
00:37:10,996 --> 00:37:12,896
Because i'm a partner
as much as you

955
00:37:12,898 --> 00:37:14,898
And you're the one on the ropes.

956
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:16,900
- I'm not on shit,

957
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:18,901
Because we know what's going on
with daniel's investor

958
00:37:18,904 --> 00:37:21,304
And harvey's about
to put a stop to it right now.

959
00:37:21,306 --> 00:37:22,939
- If you really knew
what was going on

960
00:37:22,941 --> 00:37:24,941
Between daniel and his investor,

961
00:37:24,943 --> 00:37:27,877
You'd know
it's never gonna happen.

962
00:37:27,879 --> 00:37:31,615
- Then i guess we'll just have
to see what we see.

When you get to rikers,
drink bleach.

No deal.

an answer...

You came here tonight

While you still can?

To your end of the bargain?

1021
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:11,074
- Because i don't
give a shit about your war

00:40:14,679 --> 00:40:17,647
About your firm.

1025
00:40:17,649 --> 00:40:20,483
All i want to do
is see you get down

1026
00:40:20,485 --> 00:40:23,753
On your knees
and say, "i quit."

1027
00:40:29,594 --> 00:40:30,927
- Trevor.

1028
00:40:30,929 --> 00:40:32,829
- Hey, mike.

1029
00:40:36,568 --> 00:40:38,168
- Thanks for coming.
- Yeah, hey,

1030
00:40:38,170 --> 00:40:40,970
I'm glad you called.
- Yeah, me too.

1031
00:40:40,972 --> 00:40:43,072
- Listen, uh,
about the last time,

1032
00:40:43,074 --> 00:40:44,908
I said some things...

1033
00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:46,943
- Ah, we both said some things.

1034
00:40:46,945 --> 00:40:50,780
But i did some things.
And i'm sorry.

1035
00:40:50,782 --> 00:40:54,751
- Well, uh, i have a way
you can make it up to me.

1036
00:40:54,753 --> 00:40:57,053
Come to my wedding.

1037
00:40:57,055 --> 00:40:59,022
- It means a lot to me
that you want me there,

1038
00:40:59,024 --> 00:41:00,657
But i'm sorry.

1039
00:41:00,659 --> 00:41:02,892
I can't.

1040
00:41:02,894 --> 00:41:04,527
- What do you mean you can't?

1041
00:41:04,529 --> 00:41:05,995
- Look, i'm married now,

1042
00:41:05,997 --> 00:41:08,765
And i promised my wife
that that part of my life

1043
00:41:08,767 --> 00:41:10,333
Is behind me.

1044
00:41:10,334 --> 00:41:11,900
- What does that have to do
with you coming to my wedding?

1045
00:41:11,903 --> 00:41:14,237
- She didn't even want me
to meet you here.

1046
00:41:14,239 --> 00:41:18,241
Don't you get it?

1047
00:41:18,243 --> 00:41:20,243
You're breaking the law

1048
00:41:20,245 --> 00:41:22,045
Every day.

1049
00:41:22,047 --> 00:41:23,513
- You're judging me?
- No.

1050
00:41:23,515 --> 00:41:26,082
I'm not judging you.

1051
00:41:26,084 --> 00:41:28,051
Nothing would make me happier
than to raise a glass

1052
00:41:28,053 --> 00:41:29,953
To your new life,

1053
00:41:29,955 --> 00:41:32,722
But i can't.

1054
00:41:32,724 --> 00:41:33,756
And you shouldn't either.

1055
00:41:33,758 --> 00:41:35,024
- Oh, so now
i shouldn't get married?

1056
00:41:35,026 --> 00:41:36,192
- No, i'm saying
you should quit.

1057
00:41:36,194 --> 00:41:39,062
- [chuckles]

1058
00:41:39,064 --> 00:41:40,897
Oh, okay.

1059
00:41:40,898 --> 00:41:42,731
Well, thank you
for the advice, trevor.

1060
00:41:42,734 --> 00:41:45,068
But i don't think
i'm going to do that.

1061
00:41:45,070 --> 00:41:48,705
- Michael, the longer you go,

1062
00:41:48,707 --> 00:41:51,641
The less the money matters.

1063
00:41:51,643 --> 00:41:53,910
The food doesn't taste as good.

1064
00:41:53,912 --> 00:41:55,011
The car isn't fast enough.

1065
00:41:55,013 --> 00:41:57,046
The view isn't high enough.

1066
00:41:57,048 --> 00:41:58,948
And finally you realize

1067
00:41:58,950 --> 00:42:00,550
That you would trade it all in

1068
00:42:00,552 --> 00:42:04,087
For one night of going to bed

1069
00:42:04,089 --> 00:42:05,889
Where you don't have to worry,

1070
00:42:05,891 --> 00:42:09,025
"when are they gonna
come for me?"

1071
00:42:09,027 --> 00:42:11,094
- You almost got caught,
didn't you?

1072
00:42:11,096 --> 00:42:15,131
- No, i didn't.
I just couldn't take it anymore.

1073
00:42:15,133 --> 00:42:17,233
So finally, i went
to talk to someone.

1074
00:42:17,235 --> 00:42:19,269
- Who?

1075
00:42:19,271 --> 00:42:20,937
- You know who.

1076
00:42:23,975 --> 00:42:26,042
I gotta go.

1077
00:42:30,148 --> 00:42:31,915
Take care, michael.
