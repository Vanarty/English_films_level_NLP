1
00:00:00,033 --> 00:00:01,512
Previously on... <i>Suits.</i>

2
00:00:01,537 --> 00:00:02,757
We just went
through a civil war,

3
00:00:02,782 --> 00:00:03,763
and the world knows it.

4
00:00:03,764 --> 00:00:05,031
You're using
privileged information

5
00:00:05,099 --> 00:00:06,199
to target our clients.

6
00:00:06,266 --> 00:00:08,034
Pearson Hardman
is falling apart.

7
00:00:08,102 --> 00:00:09,782
I never thought
you'd betray your own firm.

8
00:00:09,837 --> 00:00:12,271
I did nothing wrong.

9
00:00:12,339 --> 00:00:13,373
Jesus!

10
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:14,707
You're the guy
that nobody wants

11
00:00:14,775 --> 00:00:15,842
but we can't get rid of.

12
00:00:15,909 --> 00:00:17,276
You order me to rescind
an offer

13
00:00:17,344 --> 00:00:19,045
due to a firm-wide
hiring freeze.

14
00:00:19,113 --> 00:00:21,047
Two minutes later,
you hire a fifth-year.

15
00:00:21,115 --> 00:00:22,181
Katrina Bennett.

16
00:00:22,249 --> 00:00:23,850
I need you to waive
my non-compete

17
00:00:23,917 --> 00:00:25,985
so I can take a position
at another firm.

18
00:00:26,053 --> 00:00:28,087
- You went to Louis?
- He didn't betray us, Harvey.

19
00:00:28,155 --> 00:00:29,856
He found the problem.

20
00:00:32,493 --> 00:00:33,693
You may have fended off
this attack,

21
00:00:33,761 --> 00:00:35,201
but we're not
the only ones circling.

22
00:00:35,229 --> 00:00:37,897
We fended you off,
we'll fend off the rest.

23
00:00:37,965 --> 00:00:39,899
I want my name on the door.

24
00:00:49,877 --> 00:00:52,578
Nice!

25
00:01:00,421 --> 00:01:01,654
- Ugh!
- H-o-r-s.

26
00:01:01,722 --> 00:01:03,656
That means you get an "e,"
you lose.

27
00:01:03,724 --> 00:01:05,258
- Thank you. I can spell.
- Too bad you can't shoot.

28
00:01:05,325 --> 00:01:06,759
Crumpled paper.

29
00:01:06,827 --> 00:01:08,361
Winners don't blame
the ball or the rim

30
00:01:08,429 --> 00:01:10,029
or the wind speed
in a closed-off room.

31
00:01:10,097 --> 00:01:11,197
The fan was on.

32
00:01:11,265 --> 00:01:12,565
Excuses don't win
championships.

33
00:01:12,633 --> 00:01:14,033
Oh, yeah? Did Michael Jordan
tell you that?

34
00:01:14,101 --> 00:01:16,169
No. I told him.

35
00:01:16,236 --> 00:01:18,738
Come on. All right.

36
00:01:18,806 --> 00:01:21,374
That was going in.
We're in the middle of a game!

37
00:01:21,442 --> 00:01:22,475
If you two are playing horse,

38
00:01:22,543 --> 00:01:24,110
then one of you needs
to thank me.

39
00:01:24,178 --> 00:01:25,578
Thank you.

40
00:01:25,646 --> 00:01:28,281
Pussies. Out.

41
00:01:28,348 --> 00:01:29,482
Would you like to finish
this game?

42
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:31,083
Winner gets to be name partner.

43
00:01:31,151 --> 00:01:33,386
See, that's funny because
you're already name partner...

44
00:01:33,454 --> 00:01:34,987
Derek Portis died this weekend.

45
00:01:35,055 --> 00:01:36,322
What took him so long?

46
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:37,723
- Harvey.
- What?

47
00:01:37,791 --> 00:01:39,659
He lived a long life.
He was an old man.

48
00:01:39,726 --> 00:01:41,828
- He was 56.
- Didn't look a day under 70.

49
00:01:41,895 --> 00:01:43,496
Man dies,
and the first thing you think

50
00:01:43,564 --> 00:01:45,465
to say is that
he looked older than he was.

51
00:01:45,532 --> 00:01:46,899
No. That's the first thing
I said.

52
00:01:46,967 --> 00:01:48,407
The first thing
I thought to say was,

53
00:01:48,469 --> 00:01:51,070
"dead or alive,
Derek is a dick."

54
00:01:51,138 --> 00:01:52,638
A dick that convinced
Folsom Foods

55
00:01:52,706 --> 00:01:54,874
to settle with us
for $10 million.

56
00:01:54,942 --> 00:01:56,108
Well, we'll just have
to tell his replacement

57
00:01:56,176 --> 00:01:57,710
the settlement needs
a signature.

58
00:01:57,778 --> 00:02:01,347
- It's not gonna be that easy.
- Why? Who's replacing him?

59
00:02:05,652 --> 00:02:07,620
I'm gonna have the cornish hen,

60
00:02:07,688 --> 00:02:09,388
and we're gonna start
with the foie gras special,

61
00:02:09,456 --> 00:02:10,523
two of them.

62
00:02:10,591 --> 00:02:11,891
You're gonna love it. Just one.

63
00:02:11,959 --> 00:02:13,826
I'm okay. Thank you. Dad.

64
00:02:13,894 --> 00:02:15,528
I'm watching what I eat.

65
00:02:15,596 --> 00:02:17,530
- On my birthday?
- [Chuckles]

66
00:02:17,598 --> 00:02:19,232
I'm trying to be disciplined.

67
00:02:19,299 --> 00:02:21,200
Listen...

68
00:02:21,268 --> 00:02:24,337
I'm taking a case
against Pearson Hardman.

69
00:02:24,404 --> 00:02:26,072
It's Folsom Foods.
Do you know it?

70
00:02:26,139 --> 00:02:28,541
Um, of course. It's
the gender-discrimination case.

71
00:02:28,609 --> 00:02:30,443
Well, I wanted to give
a chance to get off it,

72
00:02:30,511 --> 00:02:33,012
if you were on it.
Well, I'm not, but okay.

73
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,013
It's just that I know

74
00:02:34,081 --> 00:02:37,517
you keep a low profile at work.

75
00:02:37,584 --> 00:02:39,619
That was supposed to be
between me and mom.

76
00:02:39,686 --> 00:02:42,421
Well, I wish you could tell me
these things,

77
00:02:42,489 --> 00:02:45,291
and I wish
that you didn't keep the fact

78
00:02:45,359 --> 00:02:46,893
that I was your father
a secret.

79
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:50,196
It's not a secret.
I just don't broadcast it.

80
00:02:50,264 --> 00:02:53,165
People treat me differently once
they find out you're my dad.

81
00:02:53,233 --> 00:02:55,067
Are you worried
that they're judging you

82
00:02:55,135 --> 00:02:57,203
for being a paralegal?

83
00:02:57,271 --> 00:02:59,272
No, Dad.

84
00:02:59,339 --> 00:03:02,041
Only you judge me
for being a paralegal.

85
00:03:02,109 --> 00:03:04,610
- I do not judge you.
- It doesn't matter.

86
00:03:04,678 --> 00:03:06,779
I'm not planning on being
a paralegal forever.

87
00:03:06,847 --> 00:03:09,649
[Laughs] I know.

88
00:03:12,085 --> 00:03:13,686
Right there.

89
00:03:13,754 --> 00:03:15,087
You can't even pretend
to believe

90
00:03:15,155 --> 00:03:16,923
I have what it takes
to be a lawyer.

91
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:20,126
Rachel,
you are a beautiful woman,

92
00:03:20,193 --> 00:03:21,527
and you can do whatever
you want.

93
00:03:21,595 --> 00:03:22,929
Beautiful, not smart.

94
00:03:22,996 --> 00:03:24,636
Honey, I am trying
to give you a heads-up.

95
00:03:24,665 --> 00:03:26,532
And you're taking
the whole thing

96
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,701
as an indictment.

97
00:03:28,769 --> 00:03:32,104
Do you believe I have
what it takes to be a lawyer?

98
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,876
It's been five years,

99
00:03:36,944 --> 00:03:38,544
and...

100
00:03:38,612 --> 00:03:40,379
It hasn't happened.

101
00:03:40,447 --> 00:03:42,014
I just wonder
if you've considered

102
00:03:42,082 --> 00:03:43,549
trying something else.

103
00:03:43,617 --> 00:03:44,884
Of all days...

104
00:03:44,952 --> 00:03:46,886
"Hey, Rachel,
how was your birthday?"

105
00:03:46,954 --> 00:03:49,855
"Great. My dad told me
that I should aim lower."

106
00:03:49,923 --> 00:03:52,325
Please, Rachel,
that is not what I meant.

107
00:03:52,392 --> 00:03:54,827
Let's just have lunch. No, Dad.

108
00:03:54,895 --> 00:03:56,375
Really, I wouldn't want you
to overeat

109
00:03:56,396 --> 00:03:58,197
on the day that you told me
that I won't amount to anything.

110
00:03:58,265 --> 00:04:00,299
Rachel.

111
00:04:03,203 --> 00:04:04,303
Hi.

112
00:04:04,371 --> 00:04:06,839
Excuse me.

113
00:04:06,907 --> 00:04:10,343
But I think you might be
in the wrong office.

114
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:12,311
Oh, I'm in the right office.

115
00:04:12,379 --> 00:04:16,549
You're Katrina Bennett,
Harvey's mysterious new hire.

116
00:04:16,617 --> 00:04:18,484
I'm afraid that puts me
at a disadvantage,

117
00:04:18,552 --> 00:04:20,252
because I don't know
who you are.

118
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,488
That's our problem right there.

119
00:04:22,556 --> 00:04:24,156
- We have a problem?
- Oh, yeah, a big one.

120
00:04:24,224 --> 00:04:25,591
You haven't come to see me yet.

121
00:04:25,659 --> 00:04:26,959
Again, I don't know who you...

122
00:04:27,027 --> 00:04:29,028
I oversee the first-
and second-year associates.

123
00:04:29,096 --> 00:04:30,796
It's a responsibility
that I take as seriously

124
00:04:30,864 --> 00:04:33,633
as holding the nuclear
launch codes in my hands.

125
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:35,021
Well, if you take it
so seriously,

126
00:04:35,068 --> 00:04:36,736
then why are you in
a fifth-year associate's office,

127
00:04:36,803 --> 00:04:38,371
trimming your fingernails
at her desk?

128
00:04:38,438 --> 00:04:39,839
Trimming?

129
00:04:39,906 --> 00:04:42,541
This is a gold-plated
nickel alloy cuticle sculptor

130
00:04:42,609 --> 00:04:43,542
from the south of Denmark,

131
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:45,211
and I will sculpt my nails

132
00:04:45,278 --> 00:04:46,612
wherever I damn well please.

133
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,682
Why don't we see
what you're up to?

134
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:50,790
That's password-protected.

135
00:04:50,851 --> 00:04:54,020
Please. Prosecutor99...
third try.

136
00:04:54,087 --> 00:04:56,055
That's a violation
of my privacy.

137
00:04:56,123 --> 00:04:59,558
Oh, yeah?
Who are you gonna tell?

138
00:04:59,626 --> 00:05:01,027
[Keys clacking]

139
00:05:01,094 --> 00:05:03,029
I see you're representing
Chad Ritter.

140
00:05:03,096 --> 00:05:06,766
And this is your defense?
Wow, it's like you're a baboon.

141
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:09,035
I'm in full control of
Mr. Ritter's defense strategy.

142
00:05:09,102 --> 00:05:10,536
It's not a strategy,
it's a prayer,

143
00:05:10,604 --> 00:05:12,538
which is why I'm going
to be forced to supervise you.

144
00:05:12,606 --> 00:05:14,040
I don't need a babysitter.

145
00:05:14,107 --> 00:05:15,474
You're not getting
a babysitter.

146
00:05:15,542 --> 00:05:18,244
You're getting Louis Litt.
This is unacceptable.

147
00:05:19,546 --> 00:05:21,313
Be that as it may,

148
00:05:21,381 --> 00:05:24,550
you can either welcome
my tutelage,

149
00:05:24,618 --> 00:05:27,019
or you can crawl back
to the D.A.'s office

150
00:05:27,087 --> 00:05:29,555
from whence you came.

151
00:05:32,192 --> 00:05:34,827
Welcome to Pearson Hardman.

152
00:05:43,937 --> 00:05:46,105
You got a minute?

153
00:05:46,173 --> 00:05:47,540
Maybe.

154
00:05:47,607 --> 00:05:49,175
It's not about us.
It's about work.

155
00:05:49,242 --> 00:05:50,242
Oh. Then, yeah.

156
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:51,444
Folsom Foods...

157
00:05:51,511 --> 00:05:53,245
Missy Dietler's
your paralegal on it, right?

158
00:05:53,313 --> 00:05:54,847
Yeah, when she's not texting
her boyfriend

159
00:05:54,915 --> 00:05:56,348
every five seconds
or her roommate,

160
00:05:56,416 --> 00:05:57,950
like, every other five seconds.

161
00:05:58,018 --> 00:05:59,351
Put me on instead.

162
00:05:59,419 --> 00:06:00,519
[Chuckles] No.

163
00:06:00,587 --> 00:06:02,288
I don't think
that's a good idea.

164
00:06:02,355 --> 00:06:04,056
The new opposing counsel
is my dad.

165
00:06:04,124 --> 00:06:07,326
Your dad is Robert Zane?

166
00:06:07,394 --> 00:06:10,229
Is it so hard to believe
that my father's black?

167
00:06:10,297 --> 00:06:11,764
Robert Zane is black?

168
00:06:11,832 --> 00:06:13,299
You think
this is a year-round tan?

169
00:06:13,366 --> 00:06:14,886
I know who you are,
but I can't believe

170
00:06:14,901 --> 00:06:16,869
that your father is
<i>the</i> Robert Zane

171
00:06:16,937 --> 00:06:18,070
and you never said
anything to me.

172
00:06:18,138 --> 00:06:19,705
I don't like people
here knowing.

173
00:06:19,773 --> 00:06:21,507
Oh, and I'm just "people"?

174
00:06:21,575 --> 00:06:23,075
[Sighs]

175
00:06:23,143 --> 00:06:25,478
I mean, before, with the... okay.

176
00:06:25,545 --> 00:06:27,279
Look, I'm offering
to help you kick his ass.

00:06:27,347 --> 00:06:29,548
Are you gonna make room
for me or not?

178
00:06:32,052 --> 00:06:34,153
Before I answer that question,

179
00:06:34,221 --> 00:06:35,755
do you really think
it's a good idea

180
00:06:35,822 --> 00:06:37,256
for you and I to work together?

181
00:06:37,324 --> 00:06:41,627
Are you really asking me
what is or isn't a good idea?

182
00:06:41,695 --> 00:06:42,728
Wow.

183
00:06:42,796 --> 00:06:46,132

First of ala Robert, I'm sorry
to hear about Derek Portis.

194
00:07:19,343 --> 00:07:21,997
Oh, I appreciate
your condolences, Harvey,

195
00:07:22,097 --> 00:07:24,498
but the fact is,
Derek was a dick.

196
00:07:24,566 --> 00:07:26,367
[Laughing] That's what I said.

197
00:07:26,435 --> 00:07:28,169
That's what everybody says.

198
00:07:28,236 --> 00:07:30,337
In any case, you didn't need
to come all the way over here.

199
00:07:30,405 --> 00:07:31,885
We could've faxed you
that settlement.

200
00:07:31,907 --> 00:07:33,274
Here you go, sir.

201
00:07:33,341 --> 00:07:35,976
You and I both know
I didn't come over here to sign.

202
00:07:36,044 --> 00:07:37,378
I came to negotiate.

203
00:07:37,446 --> 00:07:40,347
To renegotiate,
which is bad faith.

204
00:07:40,415 --> 00:07:42,116
The fact is
you snookered Derek.

205
00:07:42,184 --> 00:07:44,585
10 million is double
what any competent attorney

206
00:07:44,653 --> 00:07:45,853
would've settled for.

207
00:07:45,921 --> 00:07:47,321
Should have been 5.
I'll give you 2.

208
00:07:47,389 --> 00:07:49,423
Great. Let's settle for 2.

209
00:07:49,491 --> 00:07:51,459
Then I'll get you the keys
to my condo,

210
00:07:51,526 --> 00:07:53,561
and maybe you'll drop a deuce
on my pillow.

211
00:07:53,628 --> 00:07:56,230
Does it have
a security code? Doorman?

212

[Laughter]

213
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,301
Okay, you've had your fun.

214
00:08:00,368 --> 00:08:01,969
But we're not taking
that offer.

215
00:08:02,037 --> 00:08:04,238
Then when would you like
to schedule.

216
00:08:04,306 --> 00:08:05,740
Sloane Moseley's deposition?

217
00:08:05,807 --> 00:08:08,275
But you can't re-depose her,
Mr. Zane.

218
00:08:08,343 --> 00:08:09,376
Yes, he can.

219
00:08:09,444 --> 00:08:11,312
And you'll use this opportunity

220
00:08:11,379 --> 00:08:13,814
to show Sloane Moseley
what she's in for.

221
00:08:13,882 --> 00:08:16,016
When I get done with her,

222
00:08:16,084 --> 00:08:18,252
she's gonna jump
at the 2 million.

223
00:08:20,055 --> 00:08:23,224
That's more than bad faith.
That's just cruel.

224
00:08:23,291 --> 00:08:24,992
My offer stands.

225
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:27,661
Uh, it was nice
to meet you, sir.

226
00:08:32,167 --> 00:08:33,100
What?

227
00:08:33,168 --> 00:08:34,902
"Sir"? "Mr. Zane"?

228
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:37,838
Why don't you just call him
"dad" and get it over with?

229
00:08:37,906 --> 00:08:40,074
I was showing respect.

You're trying to get invited
to Thanksgiving dinner.

231
00:08:41,943 --> 00:08:43,611
You think he'd let me have
one of the turkey legs?

232
00:08:43,678 --> 00:08:45,179
I don't think that's what
you're wanting him

233
00:08:45,247 --> 00:08:46,347
to let you have.

234
00:08:46,414 --> 00:08:48,516
You think I didn't notice
that Rachel Zane

235
00:08:48,583 --> 00:08:49,950
just became the paralegal?

236
00:08:50,018 --> 00:08:51,152
She asked to be on it.

237
00:08:51,219 --> 00:08:53,187
This better not end up
with you in bed with her

238
00:08:53,255 --> 00:08:55,122
telling her your secret.
Not a problem.

239
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:56,423
We'll do it on the couch.

240
00:08:56,491 --> 00:08:57,625
Wow.

241
00:08:57,692 --> 00:09:00,427
That was not respectful
to you, me, or her.

242
00:09:00,495 --> 00:09:03,798
- Or her father.
- Or your couch.

243
00:09:03,865 --> 00:09:05,666

That's what I've heard.
Do you have a minute?

248
00:09:17,412 --> 00:09:18,646
Well, eight days from now,

249
00:09:18,713 --> 00:09:20,915
I think I got
a spare 45 seconds.

250
00:09:20,982 --> 00:09:24,552
Well, if you get a break...

00:09:24,619 --> 00:09:26,987
You think I can be bought
with cookies?

- Semisweet.

- A dollop of peanut butter?
- Butterscotch.

- Walnuts?
- Please.

Not a totally
unprecedented reaction.

Harvey brought me in,
so I don't want to piss him off.

272
00:10:14,269 --> 00:10:15,669
I just want to know
what the protocol is.

273

Harvey won't stand in
your way, but you listen to me.

You want to go toe-to-toe
with Louis,

already settling Folsom Foods.

a slightly different number.

said no to.

2 million.

292

That's an $8 million hit.

293
00:11:05,253 --> 00:11:07,922
It's 8 million to your client,
and you need a win.

00:11:07,989 --> 00:11:09,323

associates were fired,
and clients were retained.

all you want.

that sure would look good.

00:13:35,603 --> 00:13:38,205
just like he loves me.

352
00:13:39,574 --> 00:13:42,276
Since you know him so well,

353
00:13:42,343 --> 00:13:44,611
would you do me
the honor of signing on

354
00:13:44,679 --> 00:13:46,046
as first chair?

355
00:13:46,114 --> 00:13:49,450
I can.

356
00:13:49,517 --> 00:13:52,052
And I will.

357
00:13:53,721 --> 00:13:55,355
You've forgiven me with grace,

358
00:13:55,423 --> 00:13:58,025
and now you're saving me
in my hour of need.

359
00:13:58,093 --> 00:13:59,726
You're my knight
in shining armor.

360
00:13:59,794 --> 00:14:02,996
Ah. [Chuckles]

361
00:14:03,064 --> 00:14:05,399
I will see-eth you
on Wednesday, milady.

362
00:14:05,467 --> 00:14:08,001
[Laughs]

363
00:14:14,909 --> 00:14:17,845
[Clears throat, sighs]

364
00:14:21,649 --> 00:14:22,950
Um... [Clears throat]

365
00:14:23,017 --> 00:14:24,785
You wanted to see me?

366
00:14:24,853 --> 00:14:27,421
Yes, but usually that means

367
00:14:27,489 --> 00:14:28,889
the person tells Donna
they're here.

368
00:14:28,957 --> 00:14:31,024
Then Donna tells me.
That's how it works.

369
00:14:31,092 --> 00:14:35,996
- Donna's not there.
- You think that's by accident?

370
00:14:36,064 --> 00:14:37,231
Apparently not.

371
00:14:37,298 --> 00:14:39,032
You know why you're here?

372
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:41,935
Because my last name is Zane.

373
00:14:42,003 --> 00:14:44,705
You know why Donna isn't?

374
00:14:44,772 --> 00:14:46,974
Because you know we're friends.

375
00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:48,709
And you're about to ask me
to do something

376
00:14:48,776 --> 00:14:50,644
that she would tell me
not to do.

377
00:14:50,712 --> 00:14:52,679
And what exactly do I want
to ask you?

378
00:14:52,747 --> 00:14:55,482
You want to know if I want
to be in on the deposition.

379
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:58,152
- You did ask on the case.
- Yes, I did.

380
00:14:58,219 --> 00:15:00,154
And before you ask me
if I'm tough enough

381
00:15:00,221 --> 00:15:01,321
to be in there,

382
00:15:01,389 --> 00:15:02,856
I want you to know
that I am tough enough.

383
00:15:02,924 --> 00:15:04,725
That's not
what I wanted to ask.

384
00:15:04,792 --> 00:15:07,694
I want you to know if you think
it'll rattle your father.

385
00:15:07,762 --> 00:15:09,429
Frankly,
I don't think he'd care.

386
00:15:09,497 --> 00:15:11,231
Good.

387
00:15:11,299 --> 00:15:12,566
Why good?

388
00:15:12,634 --> 00:15:14,635
Because if that's
what you think about him,

389
00:15:14,702 --> 00:15:16,937
then your relationship
is worse than you think,

390
00:15:17,005 --> 00:15:20,274
and he cares about you more
than you know.

391
00:15:40,361 --> 00:15:42,196
Is this a joke?

392
00:15:42,263 --> 00:15:44,131
She doesn't need to be
in there.

393
00:15:44,199 --> 00:15:45,499
Sloane Moseley?

394
00:15:45,567 --> 00:15:47,067
You know who I'm talking about.

395
00:15:47,135 --> 00:15:48,435
You think having her
in the room

396
00:15:48,503 --> 00:15:50,237
is gonna keep me
from doing my job?

397
00:15:50,305 --> 00:15:51,338
The relevant question is,

398
00:15:51,406 --> 00:15:52,739
what is she gonna think
about you

399
00:15:52,807 --> 00:15:54,641
after you eviscerate
Sloane Moseley?

400
00:15:54,709 --> 00:15:58,579
You accuse me of being cruel,
and you orchestrate this stunt.

401
00:15:58,646 --> 00:16:00,480
We had a deal. You pulled it.

402
00:16:00,548 --> 00:16:02,216
Put the deal back on the table,

403
00:16:02,283 --> 00:16:04,718
this whole thing ends now.

404
00:16:13,561 --> 00:16:15,462
Harvey, what did you do?

405
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:17,664
My job.

406
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:22,700
Miss Moseley...

407
00:16:23,274 --> 00:16:25,994
why did you choose
this particular field?

408
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:30,643
Because I have a love of food.

409
00:16:30,711 --> 00:16:33,246
Is it really a requirement
of excellence

410
00:16:33,313 --> 00:16:35,214
in an executive
that one love food?

411
00:16:35,282 --> 00:16:36,649
It's not a requirement,

412
00:16:36,717 --> 00:16:37,884
but it's a food company,

413
00:16:37,951 --> 00:16:40,553
and it's what I thought
made it a perfect fit.

414
00:16:40,621 --> 00:16:41,888
Well, if it was such
a perfect fit,

415
00:16:41,955 --> 00:16:44,323
why were you looking
for a job in another field?

416
00:16:44,391 --> 00:16:47,927
Because I spent nine years
killing myself for your client

417
00:16:47,995 --> 00:16:50,196
and got passed over
for promotion after promotion

418
00:16:50,264 --> 00:16:52,498
in favor of less-qualified men.

419
00:16:52,566 --> 00:16:53,666
Okay, let me get this straight.

420
00:16:53,734 --> 00:16:55,501
So you hit a wall,
you blame my client,

421
00:16:55,569 --> 00:16:57,003
and rather than figuring out
what it takes

422
00:16:57,070 --> 00:16:58,471
to make it in this perfect fit,

423
00:16:58,539 --> 00:17:00,673
you give up and fold
like a house of cards.

424
00:17:00,741 --> 00:17:02,041
I don't know what law school
you went to,

425
00:17:02,109 --> 00:17:03,309
but I was always taught

426
00:17:03,377 --> 00:17:05,211
that depositions
require questions.

427
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:07,680
I went to Harvard.

428
00:17:07,748 --> 00:17:09,115
And here's your question.

429
00:17:09,183 --> 00:17:11,384
After all these interviews
for all these jobs,

430
00:17:11,451 --> 00:17:13,686
why didn't you just pursue
one of them

431
00:17:13,754 --> 00:17:15,555
and switch careers?

432
00:17:15,622 --> 00:17:18,057
It would require
a step backward.

433
00:17:18,125 --> 00:17:20,626
Isn't it true it didn't
require a step backward?

434
00:17:20,694 --> 00:17:21,994
But that's all you could find,

435
00:17:22,062 --> 00:17:23,362
cause no one thought
you were any good

436
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:25,364
at the job you had
in the first place.

437
00:17:25,432 --> 00:17:26,532
You don't know that.

438
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:29,235
I have sworn testimony
from a headhunter

439
00:17:29,303 --> 00:17:31,437
who said nobody wanted you.

440
00:17:31,505 --> 00:17:32,839
Okay, you're badgering her.

441
00:17:32,906 --> 00:17:35,274
Well, the truth is
you're untalented and pathetic

442
00:17:35,342 --> 00:17:36,642
and blaming other people

443
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:38,578
because you don't have
the skills or the fortitude

444
00:17:38,645 --> 00:17:41,214
or anything else to make it
in your chosen field.

445
00:17:41,281 --> 00:17:43,049
And you don't even have
the courage

446
00:17:43,116 --> 00:17:45,117
to try something else.

447
00:17:45,185 --> 00:17:46,452
I'm sorry.
I just wanted to make sure

448
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,454
that the court reporter
got all that.

449
00:17:48,522 --> 00:17:49,856
Did you hear it down there?

450
00:17:49,923 --> 00:17:51,424
We heard it.

451
00:17:51,491 --> 00:17:53,192
Good.

452
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:54,861
I have a few more questions.

453
00:17:54,928 --> 00:17:56,796
No.

454
00:17:56,864 --> 00:17:59,732
This deposition is over.

455
00:18:07,207 --> 00:18:08,967
This is the men's room.
You know that, right?

456
00:18:08,976 --> 00:18:10,843
Don't do that shit again.

457
00:18:10,911 --> 00:18:11,944
Excuse me?

458
00:18:12,012 --> 00:18:13,279
I don't need your protection.

459
00:18:13,347 --> 00:18:14,580
That's what my dad does.

460
00:18:14,648 --> 00:18:16,115
Rachel, the only thing

461
00:18:16,183 --> 00:18:17,516
your father and I
have in common

462
00:18:17,584 --> 00:18:18,985
is that you're angry
at both of us.

463
00:18:19,052 --> 00:18:20,686
Well, all you did in there
was embarrass me.

464
00:18:20,754 --> 00:18:22,455
Embarrass you?

465
00:18:22,522 --> 00:18:25,458
I wasn't even watching you.
I was watching our client.

466
00:18:25,525 --> 00:18:26,559
You're trying to say

467
00:18:26,627 --> 00:18:28,527
you didn't call that off
because of him?

468
00:18:28,595 --> 00:18:30,296
No, I'm trying to say I didn't
call it off because of you,

469
00:18:30,364 --> 00:18:32,198
even though evidently
you went to Harvey

470
00:18:32,266 --> 00:18:33,799
to ask in to make it about you.

471
00:18:33,867 --> 00:18:35,534
I didn't go to Harvey.
He came to me.

472
00:18:35,602 --> 00:18:37,770
Look, Rachel, you might want
to make this Zane versus Zane,

473
00:18:37,838 --> 00:18:39,071
but it's not.

474
00:18:39,139 --> 00:18:41,007
It's Folsom Foods
versus our client.

475
00:18:41,074 --> 00:18:42,942
But you're so eager to prove
how tough you are

476
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:46,078
that you seem
to have forgotten about her.

477
00:18:49,549 --> 00:18:52,518
- How dare you?
- How dare I what?

478
00:18:52,586 --> 00:18:55,154
I just got a $3,000 fine
from Judge Mclntyre

479
00:18:55,222 --> 00:18:57,023
for missing my own hearing.

480
00:18:57,090 --> 00:18:58,124
I know.

481
00:18:58,191 --> 00:18:59,892
I was wondering
what happened to you.

482
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:02,862
I thought maybe your horse
took fever, my liege.

483
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:04,130
Uhhuh.

484
00:19:04,197 --> 00:19:05,932
You said it was Wednesday,
and you know it.

485
00:19:05,999 --> 00:19:07,566
No. I said Tuesday...

486
00:19:07,634 --> 00:19:11,037
as is confirmed
in the documents I gave you.

487
00:19:12,873 --> 00:19:15,341
This here is a fight
you don't want to have.

488
00:19:15,409 --> 00:19:18,144
- I didn't pick it.
- Yeah, you did.

489
00:19:18,211 --> 00:19:19,645
And now you're gonna pay
that fine,

490
00:19:19,713 --> 00:19:20,980
and you're gonna write a letter

491
00:19:21,048 --> 00:19:23,349
expressing how sorry you are
to Judge Mclntyre.

492
00:19:23,417 --> 00:19:26,152
No. I'm not.

493
00:19:26,219 --> 00:19:28,421
I'm gonna count to five.

494
00:19:28,488 --> 00:19:30,323
You can count to 500.

495
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:33,793
The only thing I'm sorry for
is getting stuck with you.

496
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:36,128
You lied to me...

497
00:19:36,196 --> 00:19:38,197
and you know it.

498
00:19:38,265 --> 00:19:40,066
Oh, yeah?

499
00:19:40,133 --> 00:19:42,735
Who you gonna tell?

500
00:19:55,048 --> 00:19:57,883
Here it comes.
Speech number 162...

501
00:19:57,951 --> 00:19:59,719
14 reasons why I'm an asshole.

502
00:19:59,786 --> 00:20:01,654
No, no. This is gonna be 216.

503
00:20:01,722 --> 00:20:03,189
That's uncharted territory.

504
00:20:03,256 --> 00:20:05,024
And you're still
not gonna like it.

505
00:20:05,092 --> 00:20:07,093
If it's coming from you,
that goes without saying.

506
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,521
Look, I'm just saying
that you went

507
00:20:08,528 --> 00:20:10,029
out of your way to put Rachel
in that deposition.

508
00:20:10,097 --> 00:20:11,430
You promised
uncharted territory.

509
00:20:11,498 --> 00:20:12,865
We've been here before.

510
00:20:12,933 --> 00:20:14,834
No, usually you're accusing me
of making things personal.

511
00:20:14,901 --> 00:20:16,702
But this time
you're making things personal

512
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:17,770
for Robert Zane.

513
00:20:17,838 --> 00:20:19,271
No. He made it personal.

514
00:20:19,339 --> 00:20:20,840
And how exactly did he do that?

515
00:20:20,907 --> 00:20:22,675
He threatened our firm.

516
00:20:22,743 --> 00:20:25,378
And on top of that,
he tried to show Sloane Moseley

517
00:20:25,445 --> 00:20:28,114
what she'd be in for her
if this goes to trial.

518
00:20:28,181 --> 00:20:30,182
So I'm just returning
the favor.

519
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:32,610
Yeah, well, it didn't seem to
have much of an effect on him.

520
00:20:32,619 --> 00:20:33,686
Trust me. It will.

521
00:20:33,754 --> 00:20:35,187
And did you think
about the effect

522
00:20:35,255 --> 00:20:37,323
it'll have on Sloane Moseley,
not to mention his daughter?

523
00:20:37,391 --> 00:20:38,657
Here we are,

524
00:20:38,725 --> 00:20:41,127
right back to good old 162.

525
00:20:41,194 --> 00:20:43,129
Did you misunderstand me
when I said

526
00:20:43,196 --> 00:20:44,764
to cut Robert Zane
off at the knees?

527
00:20:44,831 --> 00:20:46,032
You too?

528
00:20:46,099 --> 00:20:47,600
Oh, don't tell me
you think I went too far.

529
00:20:47,667 --> 00:20:49,135
I don't think
you went far enough.

530
00:20:49,202 --> 00:20:50,970
- What?
- Your client just called.

531
00:20:51,038 --> 00:20:53,906
She wants to take
Zane's bullshit settlement.

532
00:20:57,577 --> 00:20:59,245
You're gonna want
to turn your hips

533
00:20:59,312 --> 00:21:02,481
to transfer your weight
through the ball.

534
00:21:04,351 --> 00:21:05,484
Nice job tracking me down.

535
00:21:05,552 --> 00:21:06,819
You think you're the only one

536
00:21:06,887 --> 00:21:08,521
who knows
where Judge Benjamin plays?

537
00:21:08,588 --> 00:21:09,722
No.

538
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:12,691
But I'm the only one here
he plays with.

539
00:21:12,759 --> 00:21:16,829
Now, did you come here
to caddie for me?

540
00:21:16,897 --> 00:21:18,631
I came here to negotiate.

541
00:21:18,698 --> 00:21:20,833
Bullshit.

542
00:21:24,071 --> 00:21:26,906
Your client caved
after that deposition,

543
00:21:26,973 --> 00:21:29,608
because she knew she couldn't
make it through a trial.

544
00:21:29,676 --> 00:21:31,877
So I'm gonna negotiate for you.

545
00:21:31,945 --> 00:21:33,979
The offer on the table
was 2 million.

546
00:21:34,047 --> 00:21:36,215
It just went down to one.
Robert.

547
00:21:36,283 --> 00:21:37,850
Now it's 500,000.

548
00:21:37,918 --> 00:21:39,151
You're pretty good at this.

549
00:21:39,219 --> 00:21:41,053
Remind me to have you buy
my next car for me.

550
00:21:41,121 --> 00:21:42,721
Now it's 100,000.

551
00:21:42,789 --> 00:21:45,624
No, wait.

552
00:21:45,692 --> 00:21:48,160
Here.

553
00:21:48,228 --> 00:21:51,163
No one wins if we go to war.

554
00:21:53,667 --> 00:21:55,768
You don't have children,
do you?

555
00:21:55,836 --> 00:21:59,305
You came to my house
and threatened my firm.

556
00:21:59,372 --> 00:22:01,140
"Your house"?

557
00:22:01,208 --> 00:22:03,042
You put my little girl
in that deposition

558
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:05,111
so she could see me
shred that woman,

559
00:22:05,178 --> 00:22:07,146
which I did
because that's my job.

560
00:22:07,214 --> 00:22:09,115
And I was trying to protect
that woman.

561
00:22:09,182 --> 00:22:10,816
That was my job.

562
00:22:10,884 --> 00:22:13,686
Well, your client is scared
shitless.

563
00:22:13,753 --> 00:22:15,287
So I guess that means
that I did my job

564
00:22:15,355 --> 00:22:16,722
a lot better
than you did yours.

565
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:19,291
The settlement is gone.

566
00:22:19,359 --> 00:22:21,293
You want something...

567
00:22:21,361 --> 00:22:24,663
you come take it at trial.

568
00:22:34,283 --> 00:22:37,226
What do you need?

569
00:22:37,326 --> 00:22:38,359
A napkin.

570
00:22:38,427 --> 00:22:40,028
No social security number,

571
00:22:40,095 --> 00:22:41,596
date of birth, favorite color,

572
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:42,864
allergy to nuts... I don't know.

573
00:22:42,932 --> 00:22:44,332
What's it gonna take?

574
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,700
I don't think I need to steal

575
00:22:45,768 --> 00:22:47,235
your father's identity
just yet.

576
00:22:47,303 --> 00:22:49,203
Mike said he pulled
the settlement,

577
00:22:49,271 --> 00:22:51,272
and we can't let that happen.

578
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:53,975
- "We"?
- Yes, "we."

579
00:22:54,043 --> 00:22:55,877
I work here too.

580
00:22:55,945 --> 00:22:58,413
- Now I get it.
- Get...

581
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,115
No, no, no. This isn't
about me and my father.

582
00:23:01,183 --> 00:23:02,450
This is about the client.

583
00:23:02,518 --> 00:23:05,320
No, I meant
why Donna likes you so much.

584
00:23:05,387 --> 00:23:07,455
Oh.

585
00:23:07,523 --> 00:23:09,090
Thank you. I-I like her too.

586
00:23:09,158 --> 00:23:10,391
You know what?

587
00:23:10,459 --> 00:23:13,294
I was gonna give in
and drop this case.

588
00:23:13,362 --> 00:23:16,531
But now that you accosted me
during my me time,

589
00:23:16,599 --> 00:23:20,201
I'm gonna change my mind
and do what you say.

590
00:23:20,269 --> 00:23:22,503
You were gonna continue
with it anyway.

591
00:23:22,571 --> 00:23:24,272
- Yes.
- Right.

592
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:26,841
Would you like to eat
my bagel now too?

593
00:23:26,909 --> 00:23:31,045
Oh, thank you. I... [Laughs]

594
00:23:31,113 --> 00:23:33,848
I'm so sorry.

595
00:23:33,916 --> 00:23:36,551
Thank you.

596
00:23:49,198 --> 00:23:52,367
Hi.

597
00:23:52,434 --> 00:23:54,435
What are you doing here?

598
00:23:54,503 --> 00:23:56,004
I just came by to tell you
that you were right.

599
00:23:56,071 --> 00:23:57,338
This is your case, not mine.

600
00:23:57,406 --> 00:23:59,641
I'm no longer first chair.

601
00:23:59,708 --> 00:24:01,075
Fine. We're best friends.

602
00:24:01,143 --> 00:24:02,610
Now please leave.

603
00:24:02,678 --> 00:24:06,114
Okay, I came to give you
your files back.

604
00:24:06,181 --> 00:24:07,348
All rise.

605
00:24:07,416 --> 00:24:09,817
No way.
I wasn't born yesterday.

606
00:24:09,885 --> 00:24:11,386
I've got my files right here.

607
00:24:11,453 --> 00:24:13,855
Okay, Katrina, I'm offering us
both a way out here.

608
00:24:13,922 --> 00:24:17,325
You keep whatever's in those
files the hell away from me.

609
00:24:17,393 --> 00:24:19,460
Okay. You got me.

610
00:24:19,528 --> 00:24:22,463
I'm not to be trusted.
All right, let's get to it.

611
00:24:22,531 --> 00:24:24,451
Ms. Bennett, I believe
you have something for me.

612
00:24:24,466 --> 00:24:26,167
Your Honor,

613
00:24:26,235 --> 00:24:28,236
Mr. Gibbs charged my client
with securities fraud,

614
00:24:28,303 --> 00:24:30,238
but he neglected
to disclose discrepancies

615
00:24:30,305 --> 00:24:32,974
between the S.E.C.'S findings
and the IRS's.

616
00:24:33,042 --> 00:24:37,612
I have with me an exhibit.

617
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,180
I'm sorry.

618
00:24:39,248 --> 00:24:41,015
You must've accidentally
somehow gotten

619
00:24:41,083 --> 00:24:42,216
the file of pictures of me

620
00:24:42,284 --> 00:24:45,720
photoshopped
as various American presidents.

621
00:24:45,788 --> 00:24:47,522
I actually like that one.

622
00:24:47,589 --> 00:24:48,756
I look pretty sharp, don't I?

623
00:24:48,824 --> 00:24:50,591
What you're really looking
for was this...

624
00:24:50,659 --> 00:24:52,026
[Patting folder]
like I offered.

625
00:24:52,094 --> 00:24:54,328
But per your request,

626
00:24:54,396 --> 00:24:56,731
I'm gonna keep it
the hell away from you.

627
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:59,267
Is this some sort of joke?

628
00:24:59,334 --> 00:25:00,935
No. Your Honor.

629
00:25:01,003 --> 00:25:03,037
Bring that folder up here
right now.

630
00:25:03,105 --> 00:25:04,939
And if they're not
legitimate court documents,

631
00:25:05,007 --> 00:25:07,341
you are in for one hell
of a fine.

632
00:25:07,409 --> 00:25:10,211
Uh...

633
00:25:17,619 --> 00:25:19,120
What are you working on?

634
00:25:19,188 --> 00:25:21,823
I'm going through the reviews
for every executive

635
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:24,192
promoted at Folsom Foods
for the last five years.

636
00:25:24,259 --> 00:25:25,960
You?

637
00:25:26,028 --> 00:25:29,263
Reviews of every executive
promoted at Folsom Foods

638
00:25:29,331 --> 00:25:30,932
for the past five years.

639
00:25:30,999 --> 00:25:34,001
[Both chuckles]

640
00:25:36,305 --> 00:25:37,872
You were right.

641
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:40,174
This is not Zane versus Zane.

642
00:25:40,242 --> 00:25:42,477
And I don't want to talk
about my dad anymore.

643
00:25:42,544 --> 00:25:44,479
Good.

644
00:25:44,546 --> 00:25:46,481
It's like
he was sitting me down

645
00:25:46,548 --> 00:25:48,349
and looking me in the eye

646
00:25:48,417 --> 00:25:52,220
and telling me... What?

647
00:25:52,287 --> 00:25:54,822
That I'm untalented
and pathetic

648
00:25:54,890 --> 00:25:56,858
and don't have
the skills or the fortitude

649
00:25:56,925 --> 00:25:59,527
or anything else it takes
to make it in my chosen field.

650
00:25:59,595 --> 00:26:01,195
He was talking to a client.

651
00:26:01,263 --> 00:26:03,564
You got a 172.
You're going to law school.

652
00:26:03,632 --> 00:26:06,200
He can't deny that.

653
00:26:06,268 --> 00:26:09,704
Yeah. He... he doesn't know that.

654
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:14,609
Rachel, you...

655
00:26:14,676 --> 00:26:16,544
[sighs]

656
00:26:16,612 --> 00:26:18,713
When I, um...

657
00:26:18,781 --> 00:26:22,550
told him that I was
high-school salutatorian...

658
00:26:24,386 --> 00:26:27,054
Guess what the first words
out of his mouth were.

659
00:26:27,122 --> 00:26:29,524
He wanted to know
who the valedictorian was.

660
00:26:29,591 --> 00:26:30,792
Nope.

661
00:26:30,859 --> 00:26:32,660
He said...

662
00:26:32,728 --> 00:26:34,929
"Number two ain't bad."

663
00:26:34,997 --> 00:26:36,798
He thought it was funny.

664
00:26:41,436 --> 00:26:44,272
Everyone's always said
that my mom is beautiful

665
00:26:44,339 --> 00:26:49,010
and that my dad is smart
and powerful.

666
00:26:51,713 --> 00:26:54,515
And all I've ever wanted
is for him...

667
00:27:05,027 --> 00:27:07,728
He's never gonna see
a different side of you

668
00:27:07,796 --> 00:27:11,399
if you don't show him
a different side of you.

669
00:27:11,466 --> 00:27:14,569
He knew I was sitting
right there.

670
00:27:14,636 --> 00:27:17,446
You chose to be sitting
right there.

671
00:27:26,081 --> 00:27:28,749
[Knock on door]

672
00:27:28,817 --> 00:27:30,384
- Louis.
- Hi, Donna.

673
00:27:30,452 --> 00:27:31,385
What can I do for you?

674
00:27:31,453 --> 00:27:32,820
Not for me.

675
00:27:32,888 --> 00:27:34,789
For Katrina.

676
00:27:34,857 --> 00:27:37,558
- Which one's Katrina again?
- Okay, you know what?

677
00:27:37,626 --> 00:27:39,227
You've had your fun.
Time to let it go.

678
00:27:39,294 --> 00:27:40,962
Yeah, I'm afraid
I'm not gonna let anything go

679
00:27:41,029 --> 00:27:42,697
until that woman kneels
before Zod.

680
00:27:42,764 --> 00:27:44,999
First of all,
you know who Zod is?

681
00:27:45,067 --> 00:27:46,634
And second of all,
you think you're Zod?

682
00:27:46,702 --> 00:27:48,369
General Zod
was a visionary leader

683
00:27:48,437 --> 00:27:50,304
who was underappreciated
by his entire planet.

684
00:27:50,372 --> 00:27:51,772
Of course I know who he is.

685
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,474
Okay, well,
Katrina isn't Superman,

686
00:27:53,542 --> 00:27:56,777
so what the hell
do you want from her?

687
00:27:56,845 --> 00:28:00,047
Okay. I get it.

688
00:28:00,115 --> 00:28:01,816
Harvey is Superman,
and he hired Katrina,

689
00:28:01,884 --> 00:28:03,517
instead of you getting
your first-year.

690
00:28:03,585 --> 00:28:05,586
Her name was Maria,
and this is not about that.

691
00:28:05,654 --> 00:28:07,955
What this is about
is me getting respect

692
00:28:08,023 --> 00:28:09,657
from a new employee, so...

693
00:28:09,725 --> 00:28:11,759
You beat her.
You want her respect?

694
00:28:11,827 --> 00:28:13,761
Make up with her
and leave her alone.

695
00:28:13,829 --> 00:28:16,230
Oh, really, Donna?
Is that a sign of respect?

696
00:28:16,298 --> 00:28:17,999
Leaving someone alone,
like you and Harvey

697
00:28:18,066 --> 00:28:19,400
left me alone since Daniel?

698
00:28:19,468 --> 00:28:21,502
Louis, Harvey
welcomed you back.

699
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:22,803
"Welcomed"?

700
00:28:22,871 --> 00:28:24,872
He ripped up
my letter of resignation,

701
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:26,274
and he didn't say a word.

702
00:28:26,341 --> 00:28:27,575
- Louis.
- You know what?

703
00:28:27,643 --> 00:28:29,143
Over the years, all the ribbing

704
00:28:29,211 --> 00:28:31,445
and all the practical jokes
between you and Harvey...

705
00:28:31,513 --> 00:28:33,681
I found that to be
a sign of respect.

706
00:28:33,749 --> 00:28:36,050
But you haven't had
one conversation with me

707
00:28:36,118 --> 00:28:37,318
since you told me
you never wanted

708
00:28:37,386 --> 00:28:38,486
to see my smug face again.

709
00:28:38,553 --> 00:28:40,554
So you know what?
You go tell Katrina

710
00:28:40,622 --> 00:28:43,024
that I'm not really
in a forgiving mood.

711
00:28:56,972 --> 00:28:58,839
I had an idea
about Folsom Foods.

712
00:28:58,907 --> 00:29:00,741
- You too?
- What?

713
00:29:00,809 --> 00:29:02,276
You are not getting my bagel.

714
00:29:02,344 --> 00:29:03,811
Why would I want your bagel?

715
00:29:03,879 --> 00:29:05,546
Never mind. What do you got?

716
00:29:05,614 --> 00:29:06,881
I checked the review
of every promotion

717
00:29:06,949 --> 00:29:08,049
from the last five years.

718
00:29:08,116 --> 00:29:09,817
Every time
they don't promote a woman,

719
00:29:09,885 --> 00:29:12,653
they use some combination
of the same 16 words.

720
00:29:12,721 --> 00:29:14,855
- And the men?
- No.

721
00:29:14,923 --> 00:29:16,157
What are the words?

722
00:29:16,224 --> 00:29:18,993
"High-strung, sensitive,
aggressive, abrasive..."

723
00:29:19,061 --> 00:29:20,561
Coded language.

724
00:29:20,629 --> 00:29:22,296
They went out of their way
to shield themselves

725
00:29:22,364 --> 00:29:24,665
from any one person bringing
a gender-discrimination suit,

726
00:29:24,733 --> 00:29:26,567
which means they treated
all of them the same.

727
00:29:26,635 --> 00:29:27,568
As a class.

728
00:29:27,636 --> 00:29:30,237
Yeah. And guess how many.

729
00:29:30,305 --> 00:29:33,841
113 female employees
across all 22 divisions...

730
00:29:33,909 --> 00:29:35,409
you know
what they have in common?

731
00:29:35,477 --> 00:29:36,677
All denied promotions

732
00:29:36,745 --> 00:29:38,212
due to the fact
that they're women,

733
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:40,514
not that they're untalented
or pathetic

734
00:29:40,582 --> 00:29:44,552
or lack the fortitude
to excel in their chosen field.

735
00:29:44,619 --> 00:29:45,920
This is a crock of shit.

736
00:29:45,988 --> 00:29:47,788
You didn't want to settle
for 2 million.

737
00:29:47,856 --> 00:29:49,957
You'll be lucky to settle
for 200 million.

738
00:29:50,025 --> 00:29:51,592
Robert,
play all the golf you want.

739
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:54,862
Judge Benjamin isn't gonna
get you out of this one.

740
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:15,595
How we doing today, boys?

741
00:30:15,663 --> 00:30:16,763
[Metal detector beeps]

742
00:30:16,831 --> 00:30:18,899
Sir, need you to step
over here, please.

743
00:30:18,966 --> 00:30:20,801
Easy, Batman.
I left my belt on.

744
00:30:20,868 --> 00:30:22,702
Well, if it's okay with you,

745
00:30:22,770 --> 00:30:26,339
I'm gonna break out
my trusty bat metal detector.

746
00:30:26,407 --> 00:30:28,287
[Metal detector beeps]
Sir, we need you to raise

747
00:30:28,342 --> 00:30:29,709
your arms
above your head, please.

748
00:30:29,777 --> 00:30:32,145
Okay, and I'm gonna need
your badge number.

749
00:30:32,213 --> 00:30:33,280
How did those get there?

750
00:30:33,347 --> 00:30:35,916
- Sir, this is a weapon.
- A weapon?

751
00:30:35,983 --> 00:30:37,250
They're my nail scissors,
you asshole.

752
00:30:37,318 --> 00:30:38,718
They're gold-plated.
They cost $2,000.

753
00:30:38,786 --> 00:30:40,821
You're gonna bring a $2,000
weapon into my courthouse?

754
00:30:40,888 --> 00:30:42,556
I'm just saying I don't know
even how they got there.

755
00:30:42,623 --> 00:30:43,957
Oh, well, maybe the Riddler
put them there.

756
00:30:44,025 --> 00:30:45,425
Okay, that's very funny.
I'm just saying...

757
00:30:45,493 --> 00:30:46,693
maybe it was, like,
a big misunderstanding.

758
00:30:46,761 --> 00:30:47,928
You say you don't know
whose those are?

759
00:30:47,995 --> 00:30:49,930
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Okay. I'm sorry.

760
00:30:49,997 --> 00:30:51,264
Okay, let's just start over.

761
00:30:51,332 --> 00:30:52,499
I'm just gonna need them back.

762
00:30:52,567 --> 00:30:53,967
Ow!

763
00:30:54,035 --> 00:30:55,535
I'm placing you under arrest

764
00:30:55,603 --> 00:30:56,803
for carrying a concealed weapon

765
00:30:56,804 --> 00:30:58,071
into a courthouse
in the state of New York

766
00:30:58,139 --> 00:30:59,539
and for assaulting
an officer of the court.

767
00:30:59,607 --> 00:31:00,807
- What?
- Hey, Eddie.

768
00:31:00,875 --> 00:31:02,709
Hey, Ms. Bennett.
Nice to see you again.

769
00:31:02,777 --> 00:31:04,244
- How are Shelly and the kids?
- Oh, they're doing great.

770
00:31:04,312 --> 00:31:05,612
You know, I mean...
you know, she's...

771
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,047
yeah. No, they're doing great.
Thanks for asking.

772
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:08,115
It was her!

773
00:31:08,182 --> 00:31:10,317
You think I don't know that?

774
00:31:19,427 --> 00:31:22,162
I always loved that picture.

775
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:24,598
Me too.

776
00:31:24,665 --> 00:31:28,602
Tryouts for the school play.

777
00:31:28,669 --> 00:31:30,337
Minnie Mouse.

778
00:31:30,404 --> 00:31:32,506
I want to talk
about the deposition.

779
00:31:32,573 --> 00:31:36,009
Rachel, you and I cannot talk
about the case.

780
00:31:36,077 --> 00:31:38,111
I said the deposition,
not the case.

781
00:31:38,179 --> 00:31:39,779
I don't give a shit
about the case.

782
00:31:39,847 --> 00:31:41,515
Then why did you take it?

783
00:31:41,582 --> 00:31:43,016
Because you took me out
for my birthday

784
00:31:43,084 --> 00:31:45,485
and told me you were picking
a fight with my family and said,

785
00:31:45,553 --> 00:31:48,855
"Sit it out, little girl.
You can't handle this."

786
00:31:51,692 --> 00:31:55,962
Do you know
why I love that picture?

787
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:58,098
Because I'm still
your little girl.

788
00:31:58,166 --> 00:32:00,033
Because you were happy.

789
00:32:04,505 --> 00:32:07,073
You remember what happened
at those tryouts?

790
00:32:07,141 --> 00:32:09,075
Yeah. I didn't get the part.

791
00:32:09,143 --> 00:32:12,312
- And it killed you.
- I was a child.

792
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:16,249
And most children
let things go.

793
00:32:16,317 --> 00:32:18,618
But you never tried out
for a play again.

794
00:32:18,686 --> 00:32:20,620
I did other things.

795
00:32:20,688 --> 00:32:23,490
But why aren't you doing
other things now?

796
00:32:23,558 --> 00:32:27,194
I am watching you fail

797
00:32:27,261 --> 00:32:30,664
and stall and beat yourself up.

798
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:34,501
And it rips me up inside.

799
00:32:36,170 --> 00:32:39,105
I took the LSATs.

800
00:32:39,173 --> 00:32:42,609
I got a 172.

801
00:32:42,677 --> 00:32:43,944
When?

802
00:32:44,011 --> 00:32:46,146
Six weeks ago.

803
00:32:48,783 --> 00:32:50,617
And you're just telling me now.

804
00:32:50,685 --> 00:32:54,921
[Scoffs] I didn't want to hear
some joke about your 177.

805
00:32:54,989 --> 00:32:56,790
- Ah, but...
- When we were in that room,

806
00:32:56,857 --> 00:32:58,124
I know you were talking to her,

807
00:32:58,192 --> 00:33:01,628
but it was like you were aiming
everything right at me.

808
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:03,129
And then I thought,
"you know what?

809
00:33:03,197 --> 00:33:05,031
Maybe you look
at all of us that way."

810
00:33:05,099 --> 00:33:08,101
- Rachel.
- Well, we're not all the same.

811
00:33:08,169 --> 00:33:09,703
And you need to toughen up

812
00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:13,673
because I am not
that little girl anymore.

813
00:33:19,747 --> 00:33:21,715
So who's gonna kneel
before Zod now?

814
00:33:21,782 --> 00:33:23,316
I'm not kneeling
before anybody,

815
00:33:23,384 --> 00:33:24,718
let alone the person
who framed me

816
00:33:24,785 --> 00:33:26,019
and put me in this jail cell.

817
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:27,921
You humiliated me
with Judge Mclntyre.

818
00:33:27,989 --> 00:33:29,656
Oh, please.
You did the same thing.

819
00:33:29,724 --> 00:33:31,191
Missing an appearance
is different

820
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:33,026
from looking
like a buffoon in open court.

821
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:35,695
I gave you a way out,
so don't come crying to me.

822
00:33:35,763 --> 00:33:38,431
Rapist, murderer...

823
00:33:38,499 --> 00:33:42,002
these are the kinds of people
I'm used to dealing with.

824
00:33:42,069 --> 00:33:43,603
And you know where they are?

825
00:33:43,671 --> 00:33:45,405
Spending the rest
of their lives

826
00:33:45,473 --> 00:33:49,109
realizing that I wasn't just
a pretty face.

827
00:33:49,176 --> 00:33:51,077
Is that what you think
this is about?

828
00:33:51,145 --> 00:33:53,880
You treated me like shit
because I'm a woman.

829
00:33:53,948 --> 00:33:56,116
How dare you? I worship women.

830
00:33:56,183 --> 00:33:59,119
My mother, my grandmother...
God rest her soul...

831
00:33:59,186 --> 00:34:02,756
Hillary Clinton, Gwen Stefani.

832
00:34:02,823 --> 00:34:06,693
Then what the hell
is your problem?

833
00:34:06,761 --> 00:34:10,697
You took a job from somebody
who deserved it more.

834
00:34:12,433 --> 00:34:16,770
I went to resubmit my motion
to dismiss.

835
00:34:16,837 --> 00:34:19,873
Turns out judge Mclntyre
already received it...

836
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:21,541
from me.

837
00:34:21,609 --> 00:34:24,210
The client needed it,
and you wrote it.

838
00:34:24,278 --> 00:34:26,713
For me to put my signature
on it would just be wrong.

839
00:34:26,781 --> 00:34:29,816
Well, it worked.

840
00:34:29,884 --> 00:34:33,386
Are you ready to call a truce?

841
00:34:33,454 --> 00:34:35,789
Are you gonna frame me
for murder if I say no?

842
00:34:35,856 --> 00:34:38,892
Not as long as you keep these

843
00:34:38,959 --> 00:34:40,260
in your own office.

844
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:48,234
Robert.

845
00:34:48,302 --> 00:34:50,070
What a coincidence seeing
you here.

846
00:34:50,137 --> 00:34:52,572
- It's not a coincidence.
- I didn't think it was.

847
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:54,507
I got to give it
to your man Harvey.

848
00:34:54,575 --> 00:34:55,875
He comes full throttle.

849
00:34:55,943 --> 00:34:57,877
He has his pros and cons.

850
00:34:57,945 --> 00:34:59,813
They all do.

851
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:01,481
Did you bring your checkbook?

852
00:35:01,549 --> 00:35:04,217
Thank you. I brought this.

853
00:35:07,455 --> 00:35:09,856
You're going to decertify
our class?

854
00:35:09,924 --> 00:35:11,624
I'm gonna bust it wide open.

855
00:35:11,692 --> 00:35:13,973
You see, after you brought
my daughter to that deposition,

856
00:35:13,994 --> 00:35:16,429
I realized not
all women are the same.

857
00:35:16,497 --> 00:35:19,733
No way this gets
busted up into 113 cases.

858
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,901
I'd say a minimum of 45.

859
00:35:21,969 --> 00:35:24,003
Some you may win,
some you may lose,

860
00:35:24,071 --> 00:35:26,606
all of which are gonna drain
your resources.

861
00:35:26,674 --> 00:35:28,575
You're threatening me again.

862
00:35:28,642 --> 00:35:31,711
- I have another option.
- Which is what?

863
00:35:31,779 --> 00:35:35,749
I told you...
not all women are the same.

864
00:35:35,816 --> 00:35:39,052
[Laughs]
You got to be kidding me.

865
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:41,921
"Not all women are the same."
What the hell does that mean?

866
00:35:41,989 --> 00:35:43,690
He wants to merge.

867
00:35:43,758 --> 00:35:44,758
What?

868
00:35:44,825 --> 00:35:46,459
Pearson Zane.

869
00:35:46,527 --> 00:35:48,862
No. No way. I'm not doing that.

870
00:35:48,929 --> 00:35:50,096
Oh, excuse me?

871
00:35:50,164 --> 00:35:51,844
We didn't fight off Hardman
to end up here.

872
00:35:51,866 --> 00:35:53,427
Well, you went
after the man's daughter,

873
00:35:53,434 --> 00:35:54,734
which is what put us here.

874
00:35:54,802 --> 00:35:56,369
You told me to cut him off
at the knees.

875
00:35:56,437 --> 00:35:58,438
If you're gonna go that low
to put someone down,

876
00:35:58,506 --> 00:36:02,041
then you better make damn sure
that they don't get back up.

877
00:36:02,109 --> 00:36:03,777
It doesn't matter
if it's Robert or not.

878
00:36:03,844 --> 00:36:05,378
They're gonna keep coming.

879
00:36:05,446 --> 00:36:06,767
Until I put your name
on the door.

880
00:36:06,781 --> 00:36:09,516
That's not what this is about.

881
00:36:09,583 --> 00:36:12,652
We can only take these hits
for so long.

882
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:15,655
Death by a thousand cuts.

883
00:36:15,723 --> 00:36:18,591
[Scoffs]

884
00:36:18,659 --> 00:36:20,059
All right.

885
00:36:20,127 --> 00:36:21,995
Well, if they're
gonna keep coming,

886
00:36:22,062 --> 00:36:26,666
then we may as well
just make it one big brawl.

887
00:36:41,276 --> 00:36:44,545
Jessica. What a coincidence.

888
00:36:44,613 --> 00:36:46,381
Skip it.

889
00:36:46,448 --> 00:36:48,616
I'm guessing by your tone

890
00:36:48,684 --> 00:36:50,218
that our merger
is off the table?

891
00:36:50,285 --> 00:36:52,120
It was never on the table.

892
00:36:52,187 --> 00:36:53,588
- What's this?
- A press release.

893
00:36:53,656 --> 00:36:56,190
"Female head of major law firm

894
00:36:56,258 --> 00:36:57,579
"is going to the ends
of the earth

895
00:36:57,626 --> 00:37:00,528
to fight 45 cases
of gender discrimination."

896
00:37:00,596 --> 00:37:01,996
This is bullshit.

897
00:37:02,064 --> 00:37:05,266
Look at me.

898
00:37:05,334 --> 00:37:07,035
You'll cripple your firm.

899
00:37:07,102 --> 00:37:09,470
I would rather lose my firm

900
00:37:09,538 --> 00:37:13,041
than get married staring down
the barrel of a shotgun.

901
00:37:13,108 --> 00:37:14,942
You're not gonna be able
to have my daughter

902
00:37:15,010 --> 00:37:16,010
in every deposition.

903
00:37:16,078 --> 00:37:17,512
This is 45 cases.

904
00:37:17,579 --> 00:37:20,014
And it will cost you
45 times the amount

905
00:37:20,082 --> 00:37:22,784
that you could settle
for right here.

906
00:37:25,754 --> 00:37:28,289
Yeah, I know you.

907
00:37:28,357 --> 00:37:33,261
The chess master...
you think you're Bobby Fischer.

908
00:37:33,328 --> 00:37:36,898
This isn't chess.
It's dominoes.

909
00:37:36,965 --> 00:37:39,367
Now, the first case
might be tough.

910
00:37:39,435 --> 00:37:41,169
But after that,

911
00:37:41,236 --> 00:37:44,205
one by one...

912
00:37:44,273 --> 00:37:45,973
And when it's all said
and done,

913
00:37:46,041 --> 00:37:47,642
I'll be the last one standing,

914
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:50,945
holding a big, fat check
in my hand.

915
00:38:03,726 --> 00:38:06,961
Remind me
to get the papers ready

916
00:38:07,029 --> 00:38:11,866
for, uh, the deposition
tomorrow, the 19th.

917
00:38:11,934 --> 00:38:13,868
Uh, that would...

918
00:38:15,904 --> 00:38:18,806
holy shit.

919
00:38:18,874 --> 00:38:21,743
Who the hell did this?

920
00:38:21,810 --> 00:38:24,412
All right, Norma, if you're
gonna keep letting people

921
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,280
into this office like this,

922
00:38:26,348 --> 00:38:29,016
then what the hell
good are you?

923
00:38:29,084 --> 00:38:30,418
Oh, yeah, wait.

924
00:38:30,486 --> 00:38:33,387
And by the way, remind me
to buy socks for next week.

925
00:38:33,455 --> 00:38:35,823
I'm running low.

926
00:38:43,232 --> 00:38:44,999
I got to admit,

927
00:38:45,067 --> 00:38:48,369
you do look
kind of hot as a bad boy.

928
00:38:48,437 --> 00:38:51,139
You tell me right now
this was not Katrina Bennett,

929
00:38:51,206 --> 00:38:52,573
'cause this is not a truce.
Oh, please.

930
00:38:52,641 --> 00:38:54,876
Katrina had nothing to do
with this.

931
00:38:54,943 --> 00:38:56,677
- Then this was you?
- No.

932
00:38:56,745 --> 00:38:58,713
Harvey?

933
00:39:00,182 --> 00:39:02,083
You're not lying.

934
00:39:02,151 --> 00:39:03,417
Nope.

935
00:39:03,485 --> 00:39:05,286
Does this mean
that you and I are good?

936
00:39:05,354 --> 00:39:07,021
No.

937
00:39:07,089 --> 00:39:09,056
Not yet.

938
00:39:09,124 --> 00:39:10,858
Bye, Louis.

939
00:39:10,926 --> 00:39:13,294
Wait, don't go.

940
00:39:14,997 --> 00:39:16,664
We're back!

941
00:39:16,732 --> 00:39:19,700
No, we're not.

942
00:39:19,768 --> 00:39:21,969
Oh, shit.

943
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:25,873
[Knock on door]

944
00:39:25,941 --> 00:39:28,676
- Hey.
- Hey.

945
00:39:32,648 --> 00:39:34,348
I'm dropping the case.

946
00:39:37,386 --> 00:39:39,620
Why?

947
00:39:39,688 --> 00:39:42,223
Because I never should have
taken it in the first place.

948
00:39:42,291 --> 00:39:44,559
- Dad.
- You said it yourself.

949
00:39:44,626 --> 00:39:47,028
I picked a fight
with your family,

950
00:39:47,095 --> 00:39:49,730
told you to sit it out,

951
00:39:49,798 --> 00:39:52,533
and those aren't words a man
should ever hear from...

952
00:39:52,601 --> 00:39:55,236
from his daughter.

953
00:39:56,972 --> 00:39:59,574
You're not tough enough?

954
00:39:59,641 --> 00:40:01,709
Not even close.

955
00:40:01,777 --> 00:40:04,846
[Laughs]

956
00:40:04,913 --> 00:40:06,714
Well, we never finished
our lunch.

957
00:40:06,782 --> 00:40:08,649
Tomorrow?

958
00:40:08,717 --> 00:40:11,252
Tomorrow.

959
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:14,021
But we'll have to pick
a new place.

960
00:40:14,089 --> 00:40:18,659
I already tried
that foie gras of yours.

961
00:40:18,727 --> 00:40:22,163
- You did?
- Yep.

962
00:40:22,231 --> 00:40:23,164
And?

963
00:40:23,232 --> 00:40:26,033
It tasted like ass.

964
00:40:26,101 --> 00:40:28,636
Come on. [Laughs]

965
00:40:28,704 --> 00:40:30,972
[Chuckles]

966
00:40:37,045 --> 00:40:39,547
Looks like you guys made up.

967
00:40:39,615 --> 00:40:42,016
It's a start.

968
00:40:42,084 --> 00:40:43,684
I didn't want to interrupt,

969
00:40:43,752 --> 00:40:45,720
and I know I'm a few days late,

970
00:40:45,787 --> 00:40:47,722
but...

971
00:40:49,791 --> 00:40:51,759
Is that my...

972
00:40:51,827 --> 00:40:53,728
Your LSAT score?

973
00:40:53,795 --> 00:40:56,564
Yeah. I figured...

974
00:40:56,632 --> 00:40:59,734
You shouldn't keep things
like this a secret.

975
00:40:59,801 --> 00:41:01,302
Thanks, Mike.

976
00:41:01,370 --> 00:41:03,237
Happy Birthday.

977
00:41:03,305 --> 00:41:06,807
How did you know
it was my birthday?

978
00:41:06,875 --> 00:41:10,645
Oh, right.
I must have told you once.

979
00:41:10,712 --> 00:41:12,513
You did, yeah.
I mean, I forgot.

980
00:41:12,581 --> 00:41:14,949
Yeah, this is from Donna.

981
00:41:15,017 --> 00:41:17,184
[Imitating Robert] Come on.

982
00:41:17,252 --> 00:41:18,552
That is exac...

983
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:20,321
- I just saw that.
- [Laughs]

984
00:41:20,389 --> 00:41:21,555
Yeah, that's how fast I am.

985
00:41:21,623 --> 00:41:24,859
You're impressed.
It's no big deal.

986
00:41:29,264 --> 00:41:30,665
How did it go down?

987
00:41:30,732 --> 00:41:32,700
Did you tell him if he puts
one of ours in the hospital,

988
00:41:32,768 --> 00:41:34,468
we put one
of his in the morgue?

989
00:41:34,536 --> 00:41:37,104
No, Harvey. I did not quote
<i>The Untouchables</i> to the man.

990
00:41:37,172 --> 00:41:40,207
You should've,
you stinkin' Irish pig.

991
00:41:40,275 --> 00:41:41,609
That's really funny,

992
00:41:41,677 --> 00:41:44,779
you lying member of a no-good...

993
00:41:44,846 --> 00:41:46,380
Robert.

994
00:41:46,448 --> 00:41:48,649
Oh, I hate to interrupt
in the middle

995
00:41:48,717 --> 00:41:50,184
of a <i>Untouchables quote fest.</i>

996
00:41:50,252 --> 00:41:52,186
Two doors down,
they're doing <i>Steel Magnolias.</i>

997
00:41:52,254 --> 00:41:53,754
You'd fit right in.

998
00:41:53,822 --> 00:41:55,756
I'm more
of a <i>Beaches</i> man myself.

999
00:41:55,824 --> 00:41:57,591
I assume you're here to settle.

1000
00:41:57,659 --> 00:41:58,926
I'm afraid not.

1001
00:41:58,994 --> 00:42:01,228
I wanted to tell you
that my firm

1002
00:42:01,296 --> 00:42:02,964
has a conflict of interest,

1003
00:42:03,031 --> 00:42:05,199
so I decided to farm out
the case.

1004
00:42:05,267 --> 00:42:07,668
Whose ass
are we gonna kick now?

1005
00:42:07,736 --> 00:42:10,638
Actually,
an old classmate of mine.

1006
00:42:10,706 --> 00:42:13,174
Let me guess...

1007
00:42:13,241 --> 00:42:16,010
Daniel Hardman.
