His Excellency, the Papal Nuncio...

26
00:04:09,014 --> 00:04:14,439
Monsignor Altomonte.

27
00:04:17,651 --> 00:04:20,573
Sir Hugo Macey de Farmington.

28
00:04:20,781 --> 00:04:24,494
- Good evening, Sir Hugo.
- Good evening, Your Royal Highness.

29
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:27,706
His Highness, the Maharajah of Khanipur...

30
00:04:27,914 --> 00:04:29,460
and the Rajkumari.

31
00:04:29,668 --> 00:04:32,505

32
00:04:32,714 --> 00:04:38,138
Thank you, madame.

33
00:04:40,893 --> 00:04:45,733
Prince Istvar Barlossy Nagayavaros.

34
00:04:45,941 --> 00:04:51,365
How do you do?

35
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:01,837
Sir Hari Singh...

36
00:05:02,046 --> 00:05:05,718
and Karak Singh.

37
00:05:05,927 --> 00:05:09,348
The Count and Countess Von Marstrand.

38
00:05:09,556 --> 00:05:12,602
Good evening, Countess.

39
00:05:12,811 --> 00:05:18,235
Good evening.

40
00:05:23,827 --> 00:05:29,291
Good evening.

41
00:05:32,047 --> 00:05:37,511
How do you do?

42
00:07:20,737 --> 00:07:22,617
I hate this nightgown.

43
00:07:22,826 --> 00:07:25,078
I hate all my nightgowns.

44
00:07:25,287 --> 00:07:27,414
And I hate all my underwear too.

45
00:07:27,622 --> 00:07:29,667
My dear, you have lovely things.

46
00:07:29,876 --> 00:07:33,130
But I'm not 200 years old.

47
00:07:33,338 --> 00:07:35,800
- Why can't I sleep in pajamas?
- Pajamas?

48
00:07:36,009 --> 00:07:40,141
Just the top part.

49
00:07:40,349 --> 00:07:44,813
Did you know there are people who sleep
with absolutely nothing on at all?

50
00:07:45,022 --> 00:07:50,111
I rejoice to say that I did not.

51
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:55,744
Listen.

52
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:02,504
And your slippers.

53
00:08:04,257 --> 00:08:09,722
Please put on your slippers
and come away from the window.

54
00:08:13,435 --> 00:08:14,939
Your milk and crackers.

55
00:08:15,147 --> 00:08:17,859
Everything we do is so wholesome.

56
00:08:18,068 --> 00:08:20,071
They'll help you to sleep.

57
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:24,034
I'm too tired to sleep.
I shan't sleep a wink.

58
00:08:24,243 --> 00:08:27,539
Now, my dear, if you don't mind,
tomorrow's schedule.

59
00:08:27,747 --> 00:08:30,625
Or schedule. Whichever you prefer.
Both are correct.

60
00:08:30,834 --> 00:08:33,296
8:30, breakfast here
with the embassy staff.

61
00:08:33,506 --> 00:08:36,218
9:00, we leave for
the Polinari Automotive Works...

62
00:08:36,427 --> 00:08:38,555
where you'll be presented with a small car.

63
00:08:38,763 --> 00:08:39,764
Thank you.

64
00:08:39,973 --> 00:08:42,058
- Which you will not accept.
- No, thank you.

65
00:08:42,267 --> 00:08:45,021
10:35, inspection of food
and agricultural organization...

66
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:47,023
which will present you with an olive tree.

67
00:08:47,232 --> 00:08:51,071
- No, thank you.
- Which you will accept.

68
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,158
Thank you.

69
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:56,580
10:55, the new Foundling Home for Orphans.

70
00:08:56,788 --> 00:08:59,958
You will preside over the laying of the
cornerstone. Same speech as last Monday.

71
00:09:00,167 --> 00:09:03,171
- Trade relations.
- Yes.

72
00:09:03,379 --> 00:09:05,591
For the orphans?

73
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:07,595
No, no, the other one.

74
00:09:07,803 --> 00:09:10,848
- Youth and progress.
- Precisely.

75
00:09:11,056 --> 00:09:12,852
11:45, back here to rest.

76
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:16,273
No, that's wrong.
11:45, conference here with the press.

77
00:09:16,482 --> 00:09:17,942
Sweetness and decency.

78
00:09:18,151 --> 00:09:20,904
1:00 sharp, lunch with
the foreign ministry.

79
00:09:21,112 --> 00:09:23,700
You will wear your white lace
and carry a bouquet of...

80
00:09:23,909 --> 00:09:26,954
Very small pink roses.

81
00:09:27,163 --> 00:09:29,709
3:05, presentation of a plaque.

82
00:09:29,918 --> 00:09:30,710
Thank you.

83
00:09:30,919 --> 00:09:33,713
4:10, review special guard
of Carabiniere Police.

84
00:09:33,922 --> 00:09:36,593
No, thank you.
How do you do?

85
00:09:36,802 --> 00:09:39,221
Charmed.
So happy.

86
00:09:39,429 --> 00:09:40,889
Stop!

87
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:44,813
Stop, stop, stop!

88
00:09:45,021 --> 00:09:46,816
It's all right, dear.
It didn't spill.

89
00:09:47,024 --> 00:09:50,904
I don't care if it spilled or not.
I don't care if I drowned in it!

90
00:09:51,113 --> 00:09:54,660
My dear, you're ill.

91
00:09:54,868 --> 00:09:56,620
I'll send for Doctor Bonnachoven.

92
00:09:56,829 --> 00:09:58,624
I don't want Doctor Bonnachoven!

93
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:00,960
- Please let me die in peace.
- You're not dying.

94
00:10:01,168 --> 00:10:03,129
Leave me!

95
00:10:03,337 --> 00:10:04,924
- Leave me!
- It's nerves.

96
00:10:05,133 --> 00:10:06,218
Control yourself, Ann.

97
00:10:06,426 --> 00:10:08,387
I don't want to!

98
00:10:08,595 --> 00:10:11,724
Your Highness.

99
00:10:11,933 --> 00:10:13,726
I'll get Doctor Bonnachoven.

100
00:10:13,935 --> 00:10:15,229
It's no use.

101
00:10:15,437 --> 00:10:20,903
I'll be dead before he gets here.

102
00:10:27,246 --> 00:10:32,711
- She is asleep.
- She was in hysterics three minutes ago.

103
00:10:34,214 --> 00:10:39,138
- Are you asleep, ma'am?
- No!

104
00:10:39,346 --> 00:10:42,141
I'll only disturb
Your Royal Highness for a moment.

105
00:10:42,349 --> 00:10:44,896
I'm very ashamed.

106
00:10:45,104 --> 00:10:47,983
Suddenly I was crying.

107
00:10:48,192 --> 00:10:50,988
To cry is a perfectly normal thing to do.

108
00:10:51,197 --> 00:10:54,742
It's most important she be calm
and relaxed for the press conference.

109
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:56,370
Don't worry, Doctor.

110
00:10:56,579 --> 00:10:58,372
I'll be calm and relaxed.

111
00:10:58,581 --> 00:11:00,416
I'll bow and I'll smile and...

112
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:03,463
I'll improve trade relations and...

113
00:11:03,671 --> 00:11:06,300
There she goes again, Doctor.
Give her something, please.

114
00:11:06,509 --> 00:11:11,974
Uncover her arm, please.

115
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,392
What's that?

116
00:11:13,601 --> 00:11:14,937
Sleep and calm.

117
00:11:15,145 --> 00:11:18,942
This will relax you and make
Your Highness feel a little happy.

118
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:24,616
It's a new drug.
Quite harmless.

119
00:11:24,651 --> 00:11:27,455
There.

120
00:11:27,664 --> 00:11:29,791
I don't feel any different.

121
00:11:29,999 --> 00:11:31,042
You will.

122
00:11:31,252 --> 00:11:33,796
It may take a little time to take hold.

123
00:11:34,004 --> 00:11:37,093
Just lie back.

124
00:11:37,301 --> 00:11:39,304
Can I keep just one light on?

125
00:11:39,513 --> 00:11:41,265
Of course.

126
00:11:41,473 --> 00:11:46,898
Best thing I know is to do
exactly what you wish for a while.

127
00:11:47,357 --> 00:11:51,487
Thank you, Doctor.

128
00:11:51,696 --> 00:11:57,163
The general!
Doctor, quick!

129
00:11:59,707 --> 00:12:01,836
I'm perfectly all right.

130
00:12:02,044 --> 00:12:05,131
Good night, ma'am.

131
00:12:05,339 --> 00:12:10,805
- Good night, ma'am.
- Good night, Doctor.

132
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:03,461
Bet 500.

133
00:17:03,669 --> 00:17:05,588
Five hundred.
How many?

134
00:17:05,796 --> 00:17:09,719
One.

135
00:17:09,927 --> 00:17:11,805
I'll take one.

136
00:17:12,014 --> 00:17:13,017
Three.

137
00:17:13,225 --> 00:17:18,690
Foolish boy.

138
00:17:19,942 --> 00:17:24,280
Two for papa.

139
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:25,575
Five hundred more.

140
00:17:25,784 --> 00:17:27,285
Without looking.

141
00:17:27,494 --> 00:17:32,919
Five hundred,
and I'll raise you a thousand.

142
00:17:38,717 --> 00:17:39,635
Two pairs.

143
00:17:39,843 --> 00:17:43,432
Well, I got three shy little sevens.

144
00:17:43,642 --> 00:17:45,602
A nervous straight.

145
00:17:45,811 --> 00:17:48,440
Come home, you fools.

146
00:17:48,649 --> 00:17:51,653
Look at that... 6,500.

147
00:17:51,861 --> 00:17:55,533
Not bad.
That's ten bucks.

148
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:59,538
One more round and I'm gonna throw
you gents right out in the snow.

149
00:17:59,746 --> 00:18:02,710
- Say, what do you mean?
- I gotta get up early.

150
00:18:02,918 --> 00:18:06,799
A date with Her Royal Highness who
will graciously pose for some pictures.

151
00:18:07,008 --> 00:18:11,013
What do you mean "early"?
My personal invitation says 11:45.

152
00:18:11,222 --> 00:18:13,850
Couldn't be anything to do
with the fact that you're ahead?

153
00:18:14,058 --> 00:18:16,102
- It could.
- Well, it works out fine for me.

154
00:18:16,311 --> 00:18:21,485
This is my last 5,000,
and you hyenas are not gonna get it.

155
00:18:21,694 --> 00:18:24,490
Thanks a lot, Irving. See you
at Annie's little party in the morning.

156
00:18:24,699 --> 00:18:26,492
- "Ciao", Joe.
- Good night, Joe.

157
00:18:26,701 --> 00:18:29,413
All right, a little seven-card stud.

158
00:18:29,621 --> 00:18:35,087
Okay with me.

159
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:49,023
So happy.

160
00:18:51,067 --> 00:18:56,491
How are you this evening?

161
00:18:59,997 --> 00:19:01,374
Hey, wake up.

162
00:19:01,582 --> 00:19:03,920
- Thank you very much. Delighted.
- Wake up.

163
00:19:04,128 --> 00:19:06,047
No, thank you.

164
00:19:06,255 --> 00:19:10,844
Charmed.

165
00:19:11,053 --> 00:19:16,521
Charmed too.

166
00:19:16,854 --> 00:19:19,816
You may sit down.

167
00:19:20,024 --> 00:19:23,488
I think you'd better sit up. Much too
young to get picked up by the police.

168
00:19:23,697 --> 00:19:24,990
- Police?
- Yep. Police.

169
00:19:25,198 --> 00:19:28,035
2:15, and back here to change.

170
00:19:28,244 --> 00:19:31,622
2:45...

171
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:36,840
You know, people who can't
handle liquor shouldn't drink it.

172
00:19:37,048 --> 00:19:41,887
"If I were dead and buried
and I heard your voice...

173
00:19:42,096 --> 00:19:45,101
beneath the sod my heart of dust...

174
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:49,105
would still rejoice."

175
00:19:49,315 --> 00:19:52,779
Do you know that poem?

176
00:19:52,988 --> 00:19:54,656
What do you know?

177
00:19:54,865 --> 00:19:57,827
You're well-read...

178
00:19:58,036 --> 00:19:59,829
well-dressed...

179
00:20:00,038 --> 00:20:02,959
and snoozing away on a public street.

180
00:20:03,168 --> 00:20:05,587
Would you care to make a statement?

181
00:20:05,795 --> 00:20:07,674
What the world needs...

182
00:20:07,883 --> 00:20:10,178
is a return to sweetness and decency...

183
00:20:10,386 --> 00:20:15,852
in the souls of its young men and...

184
00:20:21,192 --> 00:20:26,617
Yeah, I couldn't agree
with you more, but...

185
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:41,346
Get yourself some coffee.
You'll be all right.

186
00:21:01,415 --> 00:21:06,840
Look, you take the cab.

187
00:21:09,509 --> 00:21:14,975
Come on, climb in the cab and go home.

188
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:17,730
- So happy.
- Got any money?

189
00:21:17,938 --> 00:21:21,901
- Never carry money.
- That's a bad habit.

190
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:24,823
All right, I'll drop you off.
Come on.

191
00:21:25,032 --> 00:21:30,496
- It's a taxi.
- Well, it's not the Super Chief.

192
00:21:33,082 --> 00:21:34,253
Where are we going?

193
00:21:34,462 --> 00:21:37,923
Where do you live?

194
00:21:38,132 --> 00:21:39,384
Coliseum.

195
00:21:39,593 --> 00:21:43,222
Come on.
You're not that drunk.

196
00:21:43,431 --> 00:21:46,603
You're so smart.
I'm not drunk at all.

197
00:21:46,811 --> 00:21:49,355
I'm just being very happy.

198
00:21:49,564 --> 00:21:54,072
Don't go to sleep again.
Come on.

199
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:58,744
Where we going?

200
00:21:58,952 --> 00:22:04,419
Look, where do you want to go?
Where shall I take you?

201
00:22:04,586 --> 00:22:07,381
Where do you live?

202
00:22:07,589 --> 00:22:12,096
Come on. Come on.
Where do you live?

203
00:22:12,304 --> 00:22:16,769
Come on.
Where do you live?

204
00:22:16,977 --> 00:22:21,067
Coliseum.

205
00:22:21,275 --> 00:22:23,778
She lives in the Coliseum.

206
00:22:23,986 --> 00:22:25,239
Is wrong address.

207
00:22:25,447 --> 00:22:27,952
Look, "signore", for me
it is very late night.

208
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,245
"Mia moglie"... My wife.

209
00:22:29,453 --> 00:22:34,669
I have three "bambino"...
You know "bambino"?

210
00:22:34,877 --> 00:22:38,258
My taxi go home.
I go home together. Excuse me...

211
00:22:38,466 --> 00:22:43,932
Via Margutta 51.

212
00:22:57,242 --> 00:22:59,494
Here is Via Margutta 51.
<i>Cinquant'uno.</i>

213
00:22:59,703 --> 00:23:02,958
I am very happy.

214
00:23:03,167 --> 00:23:08,632
Thousand lira.

215
00:23:17,436 --> 00:23:20,775
One, two, three, four "Mille".

216
00:23:20,983 --> 00:23:23,444
Okay.

217
00:23:23,653 --> 00:23:26,824
For me?

218
00:23:27,033 --> 00:23:30,829
Now look, take a little bit of that...

219
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:36,506
take her wherever she wants to go.

220
00:23:38,049 --> 00:23:43,514
Good night.

221
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:48,104
All right, look...

222
00:23:48,312 --> 00:23:51,274
as soon as she wakes up
she'll tell you where she wants to go.

223
00:23:51,483 --> 00:23:52,778
- Okay.
- Moment. Moment.

224
00:23:52,986 --> 00:23:56,074
My taxi is not for sleep.

225
00:23:56,282 --> 00:23:57,951
Understand?
You understand?

226
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:01,122
Look, pal, this is not my problem, see?

227
00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:03,958
I never see her before.
Okay.

228
00:24:04,167 --> 00:24:07,421
Is not your problem.
Is not my problem.

229
00:24:07,631 --> 00:24:10,511
What you want?
You don't want girl, yeah?

230
00:24:10,719 --> 00:24:13,514
Me don't want girl.

231
00:24:13,722 --> 00:24:16,144
Police.
Maybe she want girl.

232
00:24:16,352 --> 00:24:21,817
Stay calm, stay calm.

233
00:25:01,245 --> 00:25:03,292
So happy.

234
00:25:03,501 --> 00:25:08,966
So happy.

235
00:25:28,117 --> 00:25:33,582
I oughta have my head examined.

236
00:25:34,333 --> 00:25:37,422
Is this the elevator?

237
00:25:37,631 --> 00:25:41,427
It's my room.

238
00:25:41,636 --> 00:25:44,306
I'm terribly sorry to mention it, but...

239
00:25:44,515 --> 00:25:47,936
the dizziness is getting worse.

240
00:25:48,145 --> 00:25:50,064
Can I sleep here?

241
00:25:50,273 --> 00:25:52,650
Well, that's the general idea.

242
00:25:52,859 --> 00:25:58,326
Can I have a silk nightgown
with rosebuds on it?

243
00:25:59,954 --> 00:26:02,290
I'm afraid you'll have to
rough it tonight...

244
00:26:02,498 --> 00:26:04,041
in these.

245
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:05,459
Pajamas.

246
00:26:05,668 --> 00:26:11,092
Sorry, honey, but I haven't
worn a nightgown in years.

247
00:26:11,342 --> 00:26:16,809
Will you help me get undressed, please?

248
00:26:20,315 --> 00:26:25,779
Okay.

249
00:26:34,542 --> 00:26:39,966
There you are.
You can handle the rest.

250
00:26:48,854 --> 00:26:52,652
May I have some?

251
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:54,779
No.

252
00:26:54,987 --> 00:26:56,072
Now, look...

253
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:58,576
This is very unusual.

254
00:26:58,785 --> 00:27:01,371
I've never been alone with a man before...

255
00:27:01,579 --> 00:27:04,125
even with my dress on.

256
00:27:04,334 --> 00:27:09,508
With my dress off, it's most unusual.

257
00:27:09,716 --> 00:27:12,512
I don't seem to mind.

258
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:16,183
Do you?

259
00:27:16,392 --> 00:27:19,479
I think I'll go out for a cup of coffee.

260
00:27:19,688 --> 00:27:23,652
You'd better get to sleep.

261
00:27:23,861 --> 00:27:25,070
On this one.

262
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:30,704
Terribly nice.

263
00:27:30,745 --> 00:27:32,832
These are pajamas.

264
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:35,543
They're to sleep in.
You're to climb into them.

265
00:27:35,751 --> 00:27:37,170
- You understand?
- Thank you.

266
00:27:37,378 --> 00:27:40,176
Then you do your sleeping
on the couch, not on the bed.

267
00:27:40,384 --> 00:27:42,595
Not on the chair.
On the couch. Is that clear?

268
00:27:42,803 --> 00:27:46,349
- Do you know my favorite poem?
- You already recited that for me.

269
00:27:46,558 --> 00:27:50,648
"Are thus arose from her couch of snows...

270
00:27:50,857 --> 00:27:54,569
in the Acroceraunian Mountains."

271
00:27:54,777 --> 00:27:56,698
- Keats.
- Shelley.

272
00:27:56,907 --> 00:28:00,119
You just keep your mind off the poetry
and on the pajamas.

273
00:28:00,328 --> 00:28:01,488
Everything will be all right.

274
00:28:01,663 --> 00:28:05,585
- Keats.
- Shelley. I'll be back in ten minutes.

275
00:28:05,793 --> 00:28:11,259
Keats.

276
00:28:14,890 --> 00:28:16,683
You have my permission...

277
00:28:16,892 --> 00:28:18,810
to withdraw.

278
00:28:19,021 --> 00:28:24,486
Thank you very much.

279
00:28:28,616 --> 00:28:30,410
- Well?
- No trace, Your Excellency.

280
00:28:30,621 --> 00:28:33,749
- Have you searched the grounds?
- From the attics to the cellar, sir.

281
00:28:33,958 --> 00:28:36,753
I must put you on your honor
not to speak of this to anyone.

282
00:28:36,962 --> 00:28:41,175
I must remind you that the princess
is the direct heir to the throne.

283
00:28:41,384 --> 00:28:44,347
This must be classified
as top crisis secret.

284
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:45,682
Have I your pledge?

285
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:49,855
- Yes, sir.
- Very well.

286
00:28:50,064 --> 00:28:55,487
Now we must notify Their Majesties.

287
00:30:15,641 --> 00:30:17,393
So happy.

288
00:30:17,601 --> 00:30:22,650
The pleasure's mine.

289
00:30:22,858 --> 00:30:28,282
Screwball.

290
00:31:10,925 --> 00:31:14,680
Holy smoke.
The princess interview.

291
00:31:14,889 --> 00:31:20,354
11:45.

292
00:32:03,415 --> 00:32:04,917
Hi, Joe.

293
00:32:05,126 --> 00:32:10,589
- Good morning, Joe.
- Hello, honey.

294
00:32:11,216 --> 00:32:14,971
Mr. Hennessy has been looking for you.

295
00:32:18,852 --> 00:32:21,981
Thanks a lot, hon.

296
00:32:22,191 --> 00:32:27,655
Come in!

297
00:32:30,951 --> 00:32:33,622
- You been looking for me?
- Just coming to work?

298
00:32:33,832 --> 00:32:34,958
Who, me?

299
00:32:35,167 --> 00:32:37,961
We start our days at 8:30 in this office.

300
00:32:38,170 --> 00:32:41,216
- We pick up our assignments...
- I picked mine up last night.

301
00:32:41,425 --> 00:32:46,891
- What assignment was that?
- The princess, 11:45.

302
00:32:47,725 --> 00:32:50,519
You've already been to the interview?

303
00:32:50,728 --> 00:32:53,567
Sure.
I just got back.

304
00:32:53,776 --> 00:32:55,569
Well, well, well.

305
00:32:55,778 --> 00:32:57,072
All my apologies.

306
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:59,075
- It's all right.
- Very interesting.

307
00:32:59,283 --> 00:33:01,952
- Just routine.
- She answered the questions on the list?

308
00:33:02,161 --> 00:33:04,040
Well, of course she did.

309
00:33:04,248 --> 00:33:07,043
- I've got them right here somewhere.
- Don't disturb yourself.

310
00:33:07,251 --> 00:33:09,172
I have a copy here.

311
00:33:09,381 --> 00:33:13,552
How did Her Highness react to the idea
of a European federation?

312
00:33:13,761 --> 00:33:16,641
She thought it was just fine.

313
00:33:16,849 --> 00:33:19,060
She did?

314
00:33:19,268 --> 00:33:22,064
Well, she thought
there would be two effects.

315
00:33:22,272 --> 00:33:23,316
Two.

316
00:33:23,525 --> 00:33:26,571
The direct and the indirect.

317
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:27,990
Remarkable.

318
00:33:28,198 --> 00:33:32,370
Naturally, she thought that
the indirect would not be as direct...

319
00:33:32,578 --> 00:33:34,666
as the direct.

320
00:33:34,874 --> 00:33:36,960
At least not right away.

321
00:33:37,168 --> 00:33:41,257
Later on, of course, well, nobody knows.

322
00:33:41,465 --> 00:33:43,721
Well, well, well.

323
00:33:43,929 --> 00:33:46,348
That was a shrewd observation.

324
00:33:46,557 --> 00:33:48,767
They fool you, these royal kids.

325
00:33:48,976 --> 00:33:51,771
They've got a lot more on the ball
than we suspect.

326
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:57,447
How did she feel about
the future friendship of nations?

327
00:33:57,822 --> 00:33:58,781
Youth.

328
00:33:58,990 --> 00:34:01,244
She felt that the youth of the world...

329
00:34:01,453 --> 00:34:03,706
must... lead the way...

330
00:34:03,914 --> 00:34:06,626
to a better...

331
00:34:06,835 --> 00:34:08,128
world.

332
00:34:08,337 --> 00:34:10,922
Original.

333
00:34:11,131 --> 00:34:15,221
By the way, what was she wearing?

334
00:34:15,430 --> 00:34:17,640
You mean what did she have on?

335
00:34:17,849 --> 00:34:19,644
Well, that's usually what it means.

336
00:34:19,853 --> 00:34:22,105
What's the matter?
Little warm for you?

337
00:34:22,314 --> 00:34:24,109
No, I just hurried over here.

338
00:34:24,318 --> 00:34:26,320
Naturally, with a story
of these dimensions.

339
00:34:26,528 --> 00:34:28,947
Did you say she was wearing gray?

340
00:34:29,156 --> 00:34:31,952
- No, I didn't say that.
- Well, she usually wears gray.

341
00:34:32,161 --> 00:34:35,374
Well, it was a kind of a gray.

342
00:34:35,584 --> 00:34:38,379
I think I know the dress you mean.
It has a gold collar.

343
00:34:38,587 --> 00:34:42,175
That's the one. I didn't know exactly
how to describe it, but that's it.

344
00:34:42,384 --> 00:34:46,013
I think you described it very well...

345
00:34:46,222 --> 00:34:50,478
in view of the fact that Her Highness
was taken violently ill at 3:00 a.m...

346
00:34:50,687 --> 00:34:52,689
put to bed with a high fever...

347
00:34:52,899 --> 00:34:57,738
and has had all her appointments
for today canceled in Toto!

348
00:34:57,947 --> 00:34:59,241
In Toto?

349
00:34:59,449 --> 00:35:00,867
Yes, Mr. Bradley.

350
00:35:01,076 --> 00:35:05,416
In Toto.

351
00:35:05,624 --> 00:35:07,419
That's certainly pretty hard to swallow.

352
00:35:07,627 --> 00:35:10,882
In view of the fact
that you just left her, of course.

353
00:35:11,091 --> 00:35:15,096
But here it is, all over the front page
of every newspaper in Rome.

354
00:35:15,304 --> 00:35:18,183
All right, all right, I overslept.
It could happen to anybody.

355
00:35:18,392 --> 00:35:21,145
If you ever got up early enough
to read a morning paper...

356
00:35:21,353 --> 00:35:23,273
you might discover little news events...

357
00:35:23,481 --> 00:35:25,277
little items of general interest...

358
00:35:25,485 --> 00:35:28,490
that might prevent you in the future
from getting immersed...

359
00:35:28,699 --> 00:35:32,911
in such a gold-plated, triple-decked,
star-spangled lie as you just told me.

360
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:36,751
If I were you, I'd try some other line
of business, like mattress testing.

361
00:35:36,959 --> 00:35:38,419
Is this the princess?

362
00:35:38,627 --> 00:35:41,006
Yes, Mr. Bradley, that is the princess.

363
00:35:41,214 --> 00:35:44,385
It isn't Annie Oakley, Dorothy Amour
or Madame Chang Kai-shek.

364
00:35:44,594 --> 00:35:47,933
Take a good look at her. You might be
interviewing her again someday.

365
00:35:48,142 --> 00:35:50,519
Am I fired?

366
00:35:50,729 --> 00:35:52,356
No, you're not fired.

367
00:35:52,564 --> 00:35:55,109
When I want to fire you,
you won't have to ask.

368
00:35:55,318 --> 00:36:00,783
You'll know you're fired.

369
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:06,417
The man's mad.

370
00:36:25,694 --> 00:36:28,072
Giovanni, it's Joe Bradley.

371
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,990
Now listen carefully.

372
00:36:30,199 --> 00:36:35,665
I want you to hurry up to my place and
see if there's somebody there asleep.

373
00:36:37,419 --> 00:36:38,546
"Si", Mr. Joe.

374
00:36:38,754 --> 00:36:40,381
I look... "subito".

375
00:36:40,589 --> 00:36:46,055
You wait... "aspetta".

376
00:37:02,578 --> 00:37:03,537
Mr. Joe?

377
00:37:03,746 --> 00:37:09,211
Yeah... Yeah, yeah.
Tell me, tell me.

378
00:37:10,171 --> 00:37:13,050
Giovanni, I love you.
Now, listen...

379
00:37:13,259 --> 00:37:16,556
Yes, Mr. Joe.

380
00:37:16,765 --> 00:37:18,350
A gun?

381
00:37:18,559 --> 00:37:19,435
No!

382
00:37:19,643 --> 00:37:22,521
Yes, a gun, a knife, anything!

383
00:37:22,730 --> 00:37:27,403
But nobody goes in, and nobody goes out.

384
00:37:27,612 --> 00:37:33,079
Okay.

385
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:44,259
You still here?

386
00:37:44,468 --> 00:37:46,932
How much would a real interview
with this dame be worth?

387
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:48,433
You mean Her Highness?

388
00:37:48,642 --> 00:37:52,188
I don't mean Annie Oakley,
Dorothy Amour or Madame... How much?

389
00:37:52,397 --> 00:37:54,441
What do you care?
You got as much chance...

390
00:37:54,650 --> 00:37:56,945
I know, but if I did,
how much would it be worth?

391
00:37:57,153 --> 00:38:01,617
Just a plain talk on
world conditions might be worth 250.

392
00:38:01,826 --> 00:38:05,289
Her views on clothes, of course, would
be worth a lot more. Maybe a thousand.

393
00:38:05,498 --> 00:38:06,298
- Dollars?
- Dollars.

394
00:38:06,499 --> 00:38:10,297
I'm talking about her views on everything.

395
00:38:10,506 --> 00:38:13,134
The private and secret longings...

396
00:38:13,342 --> 00:38:15,010
of a princess.

397
00:38:15,219 --> 00:38:18,641
Her innermost thoughts, as revealed
to your Rome correspondent...

398
00:38:18,850 --> 00:38:21,479
in a private, personal...

399
00:38:21,688 --> 00:38:24,149
exclusive...

400
00:38:24,357 --> 00:38:29,782
interview.

401
00:38:30,867 --> 00:38:33,078
Can't use it?

402
00:38:33,287 --> 00:38:38,293
I didn't think you'd like it.

403
00:38:38,501 --> 00:38:41,631
Come here.

404
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:43,633
Love angle too, I suppose.

405
00:38:43,842 --> 00:38:45,386
Practically all love angle.

406
00:38:45,596 --> 00:38:47,348
With pictures.

407
00:38:47,557 --> 00:38:49,142
Could be.
How much?

408
00:38:49,350 --> 00:38:53,355
That particular story would be worth
five grand to any news service.

409
00:38:53,564 --> 00:38:56,444
But tell me, Mr. Bradley,
if you are sober...

410
00:38:56,652 --> 00:38:59,531
just how you are going to obtain
this fantastic interview.

411
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:03,286
I plan to enter her sick room
disguised as a thermometer.

412
00:39:03,495 --> 00:39:08,961
You said five grand?
I want you to shake on that.

413
00:39:09,545 --> 00:39:13,382
You realize Her Highness is in bed today
and leaves for Athens tomorrow.

414
00:39:13,593 --> 00:39:16,679
I'd like to make
a little side bet with you.

415
00:39:16,888 --> 00:39:22,355
Five hundred says
you don't come up with the story.

416
00:39:26,819 --> 00:39:29,705
- What are you looking at that for?
- I just want to see what time it is.

417
00:39:29,714 --> 00:39:31,469
What day it is.

418
00:39:32,577 --> 00:39:38,043
- It's a deal.
- Now I'd like you to shake.

419
00:39:39,711 --> 00:39:42,298
You're into me for about 500 now.

420
00:39:42,508 --> 00:39:45,553
When you lose this bet,
you'll owe me a thousand.

421
00:39:45,761 --> 00:39:48,559
Why, you poor sucker.
I'll practically own you.

422
00:39:48,767 --> 00:39:52,396
You have practically owned me for
a couple of years, but that's all over.

423
00:39:52,604 --> 00:39:57,360
I'm gonna win that money, and I'm gonna
buy a one-way ticket back to New York.

424
00:39:57,569 --> 00:39:59,866
Go on.
I love to hear you whine.

425
00:40:00,074 --> 00:40:03,286
And when I'm back in a real newsroom,
I'll enjoy thinking about you...

426
00:40:03,494 --> 00:40:07,792
sitting here with an empty leash in
your hands and nobody to twitch for you.

427
00:40:08,001 --> 00:40:13,425
So long, pigeon.

428
00:40:41,381 --> 00:40:43,509
- Everything okay, Giovanni?
- "Si", Signore Joe.

429
00:40:43,717 --> 00:40:46,638
Nobody she's come, nobody she's go.

430
00:40:46,846 --> 00:40:48,431
- Absolutely nobody.
- Swell.

431
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:54,106
Thanks a lot.

432
00:40:57,401 --> 00:41:00,616
How would you like to make some money?

433
00:41:00,825 --> 00:41:02,535
That's the stuff.

434
00:41:02,743 --> 00:41:04,329
I've got a sure thing.

435
00:41:04,538 --> 00:41:07,207
Double your money back in two days.

436
00:41:07,415 --> 00:41:08,708
Double my money?

437
00:41:08,917 --> 00:41:12,006
Well, I need a little
investment capital to swing the deal.

438
00:41:12,215 --> 00:41:17,681
Now, if you'll just
lend me a little cash...

439
00:41:17,973 --> 00:41:19,684
You...

440
00:41:19,892 --> 00:41:23,230
owing me two months rent.

441
00:41:23,438 --> 00:41:28,903
And you want me to lend you money?

442
00:41:30,949 --> 00:41:36,373
Tomorrow you'll be sorry.

443
00:42:38,875 --> 00:42:42,006
Your Highness?

444
00:42:42,215 --> 00:42:47,638
Your Royal Highness?

445
00:42:48,306 --> 00:42:53,772
Yes?
What is it?

446
00:44:29,904 --> 00:44:34,662
Dear Doctor Bonnachoven.

447
00:44:34,870 --> 00:44:37,498
Sure, yes.

448
00:44:37,707 --> 00:44:39,501
Well, you're fine.
Much better.

449
00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:41,753
Is there anything you want?

450
00:44:41,963 --> 00:44:43,633
So many things.

451
00:44:43,842 --> 00:44:46,136
Yes?
Well, tell the doctor.

452
00:44:46,344 --> 00:44:49,306
Tell the good doctor everything.

453
00:44:49,515 --> 00:44:52,604
I dreamt and I dreamt.

454
00:44:52,812 --> 00:44:57,818
Yes?
Well, what did you dream?

455
00:44:58,027 --> 00:45:01,532
I dreamt I was asleep in the street...

456
00:45:01,741 --> 00:45:03,535
and a young man came.

457
00:45:03,744 --> 00:45:07,874
He was tall and strong...

458
00:45:08,082 --> 00:45:11,587
and he was so mean to me.

459
00:45:11,795 --> 00:45:17,261
He was?

460
00:45:20,016 --> 00:45:25,482
It was wonderful.

461
00:45:54,815 --> 00:46:00,238
Good morning.

462
00:46:00,947 --> 00:46:03,742
Where's Doctor Bonnachoven?

463
00:46:03,951 --> 00:46:06,122
I'm afraid I don't know anybody
by that name.

464
00:46:06,330 --> 00:46:11,796
- Wasn't I talking to him just now?
- Afraid not.

465
00:46:13,340 --> 00:46:18,805
Have I had an accident?

466
00:46:18,930 --> 00:46:22,310
Quite safe for me to sit up?

467
00:46:22,518 --> 00:46:27,944
Perfectly.

468
00:46:34,870 --> 00:46:40,293
Thank you.

469
00:46:45,594 --> 00:46:51,059
Are these yours?

470
00:46:54,897 --> 00:47:00,321
Did you lose something?

471
00:47:02,073 --> 00:47:05,037
Would you be so kind as to tell me...

472
00:47:05,245 --> 00:47:06,497
where I am?

473
00:47:06,705 --> 00:47:10,877
Well, this is what is
laughingly known as my apartment.

474
00:47:11,086 --> 00:47:15,801
Did you bring me here by force?

475
00:47:16,009 --> 00:47:18,096
Quite the contrary.

476
00:47:18,304 --> 00:47:20,934
Have I been here all night...

477
00:47:21,142 --> 00:47:22,185
alone?

478
00:47:22,394 --> 00:47:27,192
If you don't count me, yes.

479
00:47:27,401 --> 00:47:29,194
So I've spent the night here...

480
00:47:29,403 --> 00:47:31,238
with you.

481
00:47:31,446 --> 00:47:36,121
Well, now, I don't know
that I'd use those words exactly.

482
00:47:36,329 --> 00:47:38,917
But...

483
00:47:39,126 --> 00:47:41,461
from a certain angle...

484
00:47:41,670 --> 00:47:47,136
yes.

485
00:47:58,485 --> 00:47:59,778
How do you do?

486
00:47:59,987 --> 00:48:01,114
How do you do?

487
00:48:01,323 --> 00:48:04,409
- And you are?
- Bradley. Joe Bradley.

488
00:48:04,618 --> 00:48:05,995
Delighted.

489
00:48:06,203 --> 00:48:08,457
You don't know
how delighted I am to meet you.

490
00:48:08,665 --> 00:48:10,292
You may sit down.

491
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:15,926
Thank you very much.

492
00:48:17,345 --> 00:48:22,809
What's your name?

493
00:48:23,101 --> 00:48:24,897
You may call me...

494
00:48:25,105 --> 00:48:26,398
Anya.

495
00:48:26,607 --> 00:48:31,239
Thank you... Anya.

496
00:48:31,448 --> 00:48:33,533
- Would you like a cup of coffee?
- What time is it?

497
00:48:33,742 --> 00:48:34,869
About 1:30.

498
00:48:35,078 --> 00:48:36,497
1:30?

499
00:48:36,705 --> 00:48:38,874
- I must get dressed and go.
- Why?

500
00:48:39,083 --> 00:48:41,086
What's your hurry?
There's lots of time.

501
00:48:41,294 --> 00:48:44,839
No, there isn't. And I've been
quite enough trouble to you as it is.

502
00:48:45,049 --> 00:48:47,053
Trouble?

503
00:48:47,261 --> 00:48:50,557
You're not what I would call trouble.

504
00:48:50,766 --> 00:48:53,353
I'm not?

505
00:48:53,561 --> 00:48:58,986
I'll run a bath for you.

506
00:49:12,796 --> 00:49:18,262
There you are.

507
00:49:56,733 --> 00:50:00,278
Here we go now.

508
00:50:00,487 --> 00:50:04,951
There you are.
That does it.

509
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:09,708
Give me a little slack, will ya.

510
00:50:09,917 --> 00:50:13,128
Irving! Why don't you answer the phone?
Look, this is Joe.

511
00:50:13,337 --> 00:50:15,174
Can you get here in five minutes?

512
00:50:15,383 --> 00:50:20,849
No, I can't come now, Joe.
I'm busy.

513
00:50:21,183 --> 00:50:24,978
Joe, I'm up to my ears in work.

514
00:50:25,187 --> 00:50:27,316
Get into your next outfit, honey.
The canoe.

515
00:50:27,525 --> 00:50:28,651
What kind of scoop?

516
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:31,197
I can't talk over the telephone.

517
00:50:31,406 --> 00:50:34,246
One word in the wrong quarter, and
this whole thing might blow sky high.

518
00:50:34,409 --> 00:50:36,662
It's front page stuff.
That's all I can tell you.

519
00:50:36,870 --> 00:50:39,967
It might be political, it might be a
sensational scandal. I'm not sure which.

520
00:50:39,975 --> 00:50:42,670
But it's a big story.
It's gotta have pictures.

521
00:50:42,879 --> 00:50:46,383
But I can't come now.
I'm busy...

522
00:50:46,592 --> 00:50:52,058
I'm busy now, and I'm meeting Francesca
at Rocca's in half an hour.

523
00:51:48,970 --> 00:51:54,395
Don't understand.

524
00:52:13,337 --> 00:52:15,633
There you are.

525
00:52:15,842 --> 00:52:17,803
I was looking at all the people out here.

526
00:52:18,011 --> 00:52:21,224
It must be fun
to live in a place like this.

527
00:52:21,433 --> 00:52:22,767
It has its moments.

528
00:52:22,976 --> 00:52:25,395
I can give you a running commentary
on each apartment.

529
00:52:25,603 --> 00:52:28,233
I must go.

530
00:52:28,442 --> 00:52:31,946
- I only waited to say good-bye.
- Good-bye?

531
00:52:32,155 --> 00:52:34,951
But we've only just met.

532
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:37,662
- How about breakfast?
- I'm sorry. I haven't time.

533
00:52:37,871 --> 00:52:42,377
Must be a pretty important date
to run off without eating.

534
00:52:42,586 --> 00:52:43,503
It is.

535
00:52:43,712 --> 00:52:46,507
Well, I'll go along with you
wherever you are going.

536
00:52:46,716 --> 00:52:51,600
That's all right, thank you.
I can find the place.

537
00:52:51,808 --> 00:52:55,687
Thank you for letting me sleep in your bed.

538
00:52:55,896 --> 00:52:57,982
That's all right.

539
00:52:58,191 --> 00:53:01,195
- Think nothing of it.
- It was very considerate of you.

540
00:53:01,403 --> 00:53:04,199
You must've been awfully
uncomfortable on that couch.

541
00:53:04,407 --> 00:53:09,875
No.
Do it all the time.

542
00:53:11,418 --> 00:53:12,961
Good-bye, Mr. Bradley.

543
00:53:13,170 --> 00:53:17,967
Good-bye.

544
00:53:18,176 --> 00:53:23,643
Go right through there, down all the steps.

545
00:53:53,142 --> 00:53:55,812
Well... small world.

546
00:53:56,020 --> 00:53:57,939
Yes.
I almost forgot.

547
00:53:58,148 --> 00:53:59,944
Can you lend me some money?

548
00:54:00,154 --> 00:54:02,281
Yeah.

549
00:54:02,489 --> 00:54:07,954
That's right.
You didn't have any last night.

550
00:54:08,872 --> 00:54:11,293
How much was it that you wanted?

551
00:54:11,501 --> 00:54:16,006
Well, I don't know how much I need.
How much have you got?

552
00:54:16,214 --> 00:54:19,053
Suppose we split this 50-50.
Here's a thousand lira.

553
00:54:19,262 --> 00:54:21,474
A thousand?

554
00:54:21,682 --> 00:54:24,644
- You can spare all that?
- It's about a dollar and a half.

555
00:54:26,521 --> 00:54:29,317
Well, I'll arrange for it
to be sent back to you.

556
00:54:29,526 --> 00:54:32,362
What is your address?

557
00:54:32,571 --> 00:54:34,364
Via Margutta 51.

558
00:54:34,575 --> 00:54:36,870
Via Margutta 51.

559
00:54:37,078 --> 00:54:39,039
Joe Bradley.

560
00:54:39,247 --> 00:54:44,713
Good-bye.
Thank you.

561
00:54:55,145 --> 00:54:57,356
Double my money?

562
00:54:57,564 --> 00:55:00,861
- Tell me how I double my money that way?
- Tomorrow. Tomorrow.

563
00:55:01,070 --> 00:55:06,493
Yeah, tomorrow.

564
00:57:36,576 --> 00:57:41,124
What wonderful hair you have.

565
00:57:41,333 --> 00:57:42,710
Just cut, thank you.

566
00:57:42,919 --> 00:57:43,920
Just cut?

567
00:57:44,128 --> 00:57:46,716
Well, then...

568
00:57:46,925 --> 00:57:48,134
cut so?

569
00:57:48,343 --> 00:57:49,594
Higher.

570
00:57:49,802 --> 00:57:50,970
Higher?

571
00:57:51,179 --> 00:57:54,976
- Here?
- More.

572
00:57:55,185 --> 00:57:58,732
- Here?
- Even more.

573
00:57:58,941 --> 00:58:01,818
Where?

574
00:58:02,027 --> 00:58:03,156
There.

575
00:58:03,365 --> 00:58:05,325
There.

576
00:58:05,534 --> 00:58:10,998
- Are you sure, miss?
- I'm quite sure, thank you.

577
00:58:13,043 --> 00:58:14,294
All off?

578
00:58:14,503 --> 00:58:17,216
All off.

579
00:58:17,424 --> 00:58:22,891
Off.

580
00:58:28,189 --> 00:58:33,613
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

581
00:58:36,450 --> 00:58:41,916
Off!

582
00:58:43,085 --> 00:58:48,550
Off!

583
00:58:49,552 --> 00:58:55,018
Off.

584
00:59:04,531 --> 00:59:09,996
Off!

585
00:59:25,018 --> 00:59:30,485
That's a nice little camera you have there.
It's nice.

586
00:59:31,444 --> 00:59:34,240
You don't mind
if I just borrow it, do you?

587
00:59:34,448 --> 00:59:38,286
- Miss Weber!
- Just for a couple of minutes.

588
00:59:38,495 --> 00:59:43,961
Let go.
It's my camera.

589
00:59:49,997 --> 00:59:52,919
You musician, maybe?

590
00:59:53,127 --> 00:59:55,464
You artist?

591
00:59:55,673 --> 00:59:59,094
Painter?

592
00:59:59,302 --> 01:00:02,265
I know!
You "modella"!

593
01:00:02,473 --> 01:00:06,479
- Model?
- Thank you.

594
01:00:06,688 --> 01:00:08,315
It's perfect.

595
01:00:08,524 --> 01:00:11,152
You be nice without long hair.

596
01:00:11,361 --> 01:00:13,823
Now it's cool.

597
01:00:14,031 --> 01:00:17,578
Yes.
It's just what I wanted.

598
01:00:17,786 --> 01:00:21,585
Now, why you not come
dancing tonight with me?

599
01:00:21,793 --> 01:00:24,170
You should see.
It's so nice.

600
01:00:24,379 --> 01:00:26,842
It's on a boat on the "Tevere"...

601
01:00:27,050 --> 01:00:29,012
Tiber.
The river by Sant'Angelo.

602
01:00:29,220 --> 01:00:31,014
Moonlight, music.

603
01:00:31,222 --> 01:00:33,851
It's very, very...
Very.

604
01:00:34,059 --> 01:00:39,526
- Please? You come?
- I wish I could.

605
01:00:40,277 --> 01:00:45,368
But your friend,
I not think they recognize you.

606
01:00:45,577 --> 01:00:48,414
No, I don't think they will.

607
01:00:48,623 --> 01:00:54,088
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

608
01:00:54,339 --> 01:00:57,843
After 9:00, I'll be there dancing on river.

609
01:00:58,052 --> 01:01:00,598
Remember Sant'Angelo.
All my friends...

610
01:01:00,806 --> 01:01:06,272
If you come, you will be
most pretty of all girl.

611
01:01:08,484 --> 01:01:10,612
Thank you.

612
01:01:10,820 --> 01:01:16,287
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

613
01:02:06,525 --> 01:02:11,991
- Gelato?
- Gelato.

614
01:02:12,533 --> 01:02:18,000
Thank you.

615
01:02:40,198 --> 01:02:42,660
A thousand lire.

616
01:02:42,868 --> 01:02:46,790
No money.

617
01:02:46,998 --> 01:02:52,465
I'm sorry.
I've really no money.

618
01:02:53,549 --> 01:02:59,016
Look.

619
01:03:00,518 --> 01:03:05,984
I'm sorry.

620
01:03:35,443 --> 01:03:37,863
Well, it's you.

621
01:03:38,071 --> 01:03:42,411
- Yes, Mr. Bradley.
- Or is it?

622
01:03:42,619 --> 01:03:48,045
- Do you like it?
- Yeah. Very much.

623
01:03:49,713 --> 01:03:52,383
So that was your mysterious appointment.

624
01:03:52,592 --> 01:03:55,888
- I have a confession to make.
- Confession?

625
01:03:56,096 --> 01:04:01,271
Yes.
I ran away last night... from school.

626
01:04:01,480 --> 01:04:04,610
What was the matter,
trouble with the teacher?

627
01:04:04,818 --> 01:04:06,111
No, nothing like that.

628
01:04:06,320 --> 01:04:08,573
You don't just run away
from school for nothing.

629
01:04:08,782 --> 01:04:11,202
I only meant it to be for an hour or two.

630
01:04:11,410 --> 01:04:15,249
They gave me something last night
to make me sleep.

631
01:04:15,458 --> 01:04:19,422
I see.

632
01:04:19,631 --> 01:04:21,425
Now I'd better get a taxi and go back.

633
01:04:21,634 --> 01:04:24,429
Look, before you do...

634
01:04:24,638 --> 01:04:28,184
why don't you take
a little time for yourself?

635
01:04:28,393 --> 01:04:30,145
Maybe another hour.

636
01:04:30,354 --> 01:04:33,900
Live dangerously.
Take the whole day.

637
01:04:34,109 --> 01:04:36,363
I could do some of the things
I've always wanted to.

638
01:04:36,571 --> 01:04:39,325
- Like what?
- You can't imagine.

639
01:04:39,534 --> 01:04:42,830
I'd like to do just whatever I like
the whole day long.

640
01:04:43,038 --> 01:04:45,834
You mean things like having
your hair cut, eating gelato?

641
01:04:46,042 --> 01:04:51,467
Yes. I'd like to sit at a sidewalk cafe
and look in shop windows...

642
01:04:51,634 --> 01:04:53,262
walk in the rain...

643
01:04:53,470 --> 01:04:57,183
have fun and maybe some excitement.

644
01:04:57,392 --> 01:04:59,770
Doesn't seem much to you, does it?

645
01:04:59,979 --> 01:05:01,815
It's great.

646
01:05:02,024 --> 01:05:06,447
Tell you what.
Why don't we do all those things together?

647
01:05:06,655 --> 01:05:08,659
- Don't you have to work?
- Work?

648
01:05:08,868 --> 01:05:10,661
No.
Today's gonna be a holiday.

649
01:05:10,871 --> 01:05:13,749
You don't want to do
a lot of silly things.

650
01:05:13,957 --> 01:05:18,255
Don't I? First wish,
one sidewalk cafe coming right up.

651
01:05:18,464 --> 01:05:23,929
I know just the place.
Rocca's.

652
01:05:30,230 --> 01:05:32,942
What will the people at school say
when they see your new haircut?

653
01:05:33,151 --> 01:05:35,571
They'll have a fit.

654
01:05:35,780 --> 01:05:39,452
What would they say if they knew
I'd spent the night in your room?

655
01:05:39,660 --> 01:05:43,833
Well, I'll tell you what. You don't
tell your folks, and I won't tell mine.

656
01:05:44,043 --> 01:05:47,339
- It's a pact.
- What would you like to drink?

657
01:05:47,547 --> 01:05:53,013
Champagne, please.

658
01:05:54,140 --> 01:05:57,436
Champagne?

659
01:05:57,645 --> 01:06:03,111
Well, champagne "per la signorina"
and cold coffee for me.

660
01:06:05,572 --> 01:06:08,743
Must be quite a life you have
in that school. Champagne for lunch.

661
01:06:08,952 --> 01:06:11,498
- Only on special occasions.
- For instance?

662
01:06:11,706 --> 01:06:13,792
The last time was my father's anniversary.

663
01:06:14,001 --> 01:06:19,008
- Wedding?
- No. It was the 40th anniversary of...

664
01:06:19,217 --> 01:06:21,011
of the day he got his job.

665
01:06:21,220 --> 01:06:25,434
40 years on the job.
What do you know about that?

666
01:06:25,642 --> 01:06:27,896
What does he do?

667
01:06:28,105 --> 01:06:31,569
Well, mostly you might call it
public relations.

668
01:06:31,777 --> 01:06:33,947
Well, that's hard work.

669
01:06:34,156 --> 01:06:36,658
- Yes. I wouldn't care for it.
- Does he?

670
01:06:36,867 --> 01:06:40,831
- I've heard him complain about it.
- Why doesn't he quit?

671
01:06:41,039 --> 01:06:45,379
Well, people in that line of work
almost never do quit...

672
01:06:45,588 --> 01:06:48,468
unless it's actually unhealthy
for them to continue.

673
01:06:48,676 --> 01:06:51,513
Well, here's to his health, then.

674
01:06:51,722 --> 01:06:57,188
You know, that's what everybody says.

675
01:06:59,649 --> 01:07:03,362
- It's all right?
- Yes, thank you.

676
01:07:03,571 --> 01:07:05,366
What is your work?

677
01:07:05,575 --> 01:07:08,537
I'm, in the selling game.

678
01:07:08,746 --> 01:07:14,170
Really? How interesting.
What do you sell?

679
01:07:15,088 --> 01:07:16,548
Fertilizer.

680
01:07:16,757 --> 01:07:22,182
Chemicals. You know, chemicals.
Stuff like that.

681
01:07:27,940 --> 01:07:30,150
Irving!
Well, am I glad to see you!

682
01:07:30,360 --> 01:07:32,655
Why?
Did you forget your wallet?

683
01:07:32,863 --> 01:07:35,659
- Pull up a chair. Sit down with us.
- So you're gonna introduce me?

684
01:07:35,867 --> 01:07:38,539
Yes. This is a good friend of mine,
Irving Radovich. Anya, Irving.

685
01:07:40,417 --> 01:07:42,877
- Anya...
- Smith.

686
01:07:43,086 --> 01:07:48,218
- Hiya, Smitty.
- Charmed.

687
01:07:48,427 --> 01:07:53,893
Hey, anybody ever tell you
you're a dead ringer for...

688
01:07:58,275 --> 01:08:00,611
Well, I guess I'll be going.

689
01:08:00,820 --> 01:08:06,286
Don't do anything like that, Irving.
Sit down. Join us. Join us.

690
01:08:07,830 --> 01:08:11,627
Well, just till Francesca gets here.

691
01:08:11,836 --> 01:08:14,715
Tell me, Mr. Radovich...

692
01:08:14,923 --> 01:08:16,675
- what is a ringer?
- Waiter?

693
01:08:16,885 --> 01:08:20,890
It's an American term, and it means...

694
01:08:21,098 --> 01:08:24,228
anyone who has a great deal of charm.

695
01:08:24,437 --> 01:08:27,566
Thank you.

696
01:08:27,775 --> 01:08:32,907
You're welcome.

697
01:08:33,115 --> 01:08:34,743
Cousins.

698
01:08:34,951 --> 01:08:38,706
Mr. Bradley's just been telling me
all about his work.

699
01:08:38,915 --> 01:08:41,753
- I'd like to have heard that.
- What do you do?

700
01:08:41,961 --> 01:08:45,217
I'm in the same racket as Joe, only I'm...

701
01:08:45,425 --> 01:08:48,304
I'm awfully sorry, Irving.

702
01:08:48,513 --> 01:08:51,058
- For the love of... What are you...
- I'm sorry, Irving.

703
01:08:51,266 --> 01:08:54,521
I can take a hint.
I'll see you around.

704
01:08:54,729 --> 01:08:59,694
- Your drink's here. Please sit down.
- Here's your drink. Take it easy.

705
01:08:59,903 --> 01:09:03,910
I'm sorry about that.
Sit down. That's a good fellow.

706
01:09:04,119 --> 01:09:09,291
That's a boy.

707
01:09:09,500 --> 01:09:14,716
- You're twisting my arm, you know.
- Just be more careful not to spill.

708
01:09:14,925 --> 01:09:16,376
Spill?
Who's been doing the spilling?

709
01:09:16,385 --> 01:09:18,139
- You.
- Me?

710
01:09:18,347 --> 01:09:20,642
Yeah.

711
01:09:20,851 --> 01:09:25,857
Where did you find this loony?

712
01:09:26,065 --> 01:09:28,277
You're okay.
Here's to you?

713
01:09:28,485 --> 01:09:31,365
Here's hoping for the best.

714
01:09:31,574 --> 01:09:37,040
If it wasn't for that hair,
I'd swear that...

715
01:09:39,376 --> 01:09:41,921
Thanks.

716
01:09:42,130 --> 01:09:44,383
You slipped, Irving.
Slipped and almost hurt yourself.

717
01:09:44,592 --> 01:09:47,763
I slipped?
I almost hurt myself?

718
01:09:47,972 --> 01:09:50,017
- Joe, I didn't slip!
- You've got a bad sprain.

719
01:09:50,225 --> 01:09:54,273
- Never mind I got a sprain.
- We'd better go and get it fixed up.

720
01:09:54,482 --> 01:09:57,944
- Excuse us for a minute.
- Yes, of course. I'm so sorry.

721
01:09:58,153 --> 01:10:02,367
Joe, now wait a minute.
What are you trying to do?

722
01:10:02,576 --> 01:10:05,070
- Have you got your lighter?
- What's that got to do with it?

723
01:10:05,079 --> 01:10:07,332
- Have you got it?
- Yeah, but what are you trying to do?

724
01:10:07,341 --> 01:10:11,230
Listen.
What would you do for five grand?

725
01:10:11,339 --> 01:10:13,342
Five grand?

726
01:10:13,550 --> 01:10:15,802
She doesn't know who I am or what I do.

727
01:10:16,011 --> 01:10:18,891
Look, Irving, this is my story.
I dug it up. I gotta protect it.

728
01:10:19,099 --> 01:10:20,977
She's really the...

729
01:10:21,186 --> 01:10:24,148
Your tintypes are gonna make
this little epic twice as valuable.

730
01:10:24,358 --> 01:10:27,320
- "The princess goes slumming."
- You're in for 25 % of the take.

731
01:10:27,529 --> 01:10:31,158
- The take's five G's.
- Minimum. Hennessy shook hands on it.

732
01:10:31,367 --> 01:10:34,329
- That's $1,500.
- It's 1,250.

733
01:10:34,538 --> 01:10:39,169
- Okay. Now you shake.
- Okay, now lend me 30,000.

734
01:10:39,378 --> 01:10:41,465
That's 50 bucks.
You gonna buy the crown jewels?

735
01:10:41,674 --> 01:10:44,068
She's out there now drinking
champagne that I can't pay for.

736
01:10:44,077 --> 01:10:45,670
We got to entertain her, don't we?

737
01:10:45,679 --> 01:10:48,474
We can't go running around town
with a hot princess.

738
01:10:48,683 --> 01:10:54,149
Do you want in on this deal or don't you?

739
01:10:58,364 --> 01:11:00,367
This I want back Saturday.

740
01:11:00,576 --> 01:11:06,040
Now where's your lighter?
Let's go to work.

741
01:11:12,508 --> 01:11:15,013
Better now?

742
01:11:15,221 --> 01:11:17,349
- Your ear.
- My ear?

743
01:11:17,558 --> 01:11:20,979
Yeah.
Joe fixed it.

744
01:11:21,188 --> 01:11:22,982
Would you care for a cigarette?

745
01:11:23,191 --> 01:11:24,984
Yes, please.

746
01:11:25,194 --> 01:11:27,822
You won't believe this,
but it's my very first.

747
01:11:28,031 --> 01:11:30,326
Your very first?

748
01:11:30,534 --> 01:11:32,787
No smoking in school?

749
01:11:32,997 --> 01:11:38,462
Your first cigarette.

750
01:11:41,716 --> 01:11:44,930
There.
The gizmo works.

751
01:11:45,138 --> 01:11:47,476
Well, what's the verdict?
Okay?

752
01:11:47,684 --> 01:11:49,562
Nothing to it.

753
01:11:49,771 --> 01:11:55,236
That's right.
Nothing to it.

754
01:11:55,319 --> 01:11:57,447
I'll stretch my legs a little here.

755
01:11:57,656 --> 01:12:03,081
- I'll pick this one up, Irving.
- Yeah. You can afford it.

756
01:12:03,540 --> 01:12:07,254
Well, what shall we do next?
Shall we make out a little schedule?

757
01:12:07,462 --> 01:12:10,132
Not that word, please.

758
01:12:10,341 --> 01:12:13,470
I didn't mean a work... school schedule.

759
01:12:13,679 --> 01:12:16,057
I meant a fun schedule.

760
01:12:16,267 --> 01:12:21,732
- Yes. Let's just go.
- How about you, Irving? Are you ready?

761
01:12:22,316 --> 01:12:27,782
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

762
01:12:30,119 --> 01:12:31,370
This is...

763
01:12:31,579 --> 01:12:34,458
- Smitty.
- She's a grand girl, Irving. Grand.

764
01:12:34,667 --> 01:12:38,214
Five grand, Irving.

765
01:12:38,423 --> 01:12:40,384
Where are you going now?

766
01:12:40,593 --> 01:12:46,058
Honey, I got to work.
I'll call you tonight.

767
01:13:23,320 --> 01:13:25,656
Look at those men!

768
01:13:25,864 --> 01:13:28,327
They were supposed to be inconspicuous.

769
01:13:28,535 --> 01:13:34,001
You asked for plainclothes.

770
01:15:21,028 --> 01:15:26,495
Stop!
Come back!

771
01:15:35,299 --> 01:15:40,724
- Let me take it.
- No. Let go. I can do it.

772
01:17:19,656 --> 01:17:23,036
I'm going straight from now on.

773
01:17:23,244 --> 01:17:26,040
American news service?
What did he mean?

774
01:17:26,248 --> 01:17:30,755
Well, you say you're with the press,
you can get away with anything.

775
01:17:30,963 --> 01:17:33,592
Go to church to get married on a scooter.
That's a hot one.

776
01:17:33,800 --> 01:17:39,267
Joe's a wonderful liar.

777
01:17:44,273 --> 01:17:49,740
Congratulations.
Congratulations.

778
01:17:59,212 --> 01:18:02,299
You don't have to look so worried.
I won't hold you to it.

779
01:18:02,508 --> 01:18:04,302
Thank you very much.

780
01:18:04,511 --> 01:18:06,847
You don't have to be too grateful.

781
01:18:07,056 --> 01:18:10,645
Okay, I won't.

782
01:18:10,853 --> 01:18:13,524
I'm a good liar, too, aren't I?

783
01:18:13,732 --> 01:18:16,444
The best I ever met.

784
01:18:16,653 --> 01:18:18,447
Thank you very much.

785
01:18:18,656 --> 01:18:20,324
Say!

786
01:18:20,533 --> 01:18:25,999
Come with me.

787
01:18:28,546 --> 01:18:32,134
The mouth of truth. The legend is
that if you're given to lying...

788
01:18:32,342 --> 01:18:35,638
and put your hand in there,
it'll be bitten off.

789
01:18:35,847 --> 01:18:41,312
- What a horrid idea.
- Let's see you do it.

790
01:19:05,765 --> 01:19:09,770
Let's see you do it.

791
01:19:09,978 --> 01:19:15,445
Sure.

792
01:19:30,299 --> 01:19:31,676
Hello.

793
01:19:31,885 --> 01:19:35,766
You beast!
It was perfectly all right!

794
01:19:35,974 --> 01:19:40,605
- I'm sorry. It's just a joke.
- You never hurt your hand.

795
01:19:40,814 --> 01:19:43,609
- I'm sorry. You okay?
- Yes.

796
01:19:43,819 --> 01:19:49,285
All right. Let's go.
Look out!

797
01:19:55,669 --> 01:20:01,135
I'll park at the corner.

798
01:20:18,952 --> 01:20:22,708
What do they mean, all these inscriptions?

799
01:20:22,916 --> 01:20:26,045
Well, each one represents a wish fulfilled.

800
01:20:26,254 --> 01:20:29,175
It all started during the war when
there was an air raid right out here.

801
01:20:29,383 --> 01:20:32,971
A man with his four children
was caught in the street.

802
01:20:33,180 --> 01:20:35,684
They ran over against the wall
right there for shelter...

803
01:20:35,893 --> 01:20:37,186
and prayed for safety.

804
01:20:37,394 --> 01:20:40,274
Bombs fell very close, but no one was hurt.

805
01:20:40,483 --> 01:20:44,529
Later on, the man came back and
he put up the first of these tablets.

806
01:20:44,739 --> 01:20:46,741
Since then, it's become sort of a shrine.

807
01:20:46,949 --> 01:20:49,536
People come, and whenever
their wishes are granted...

808
01:20:49,745 --> 01:20:53,542
they put up another one
of these little plaques.

809
01:20:53,751 --> 01:20:58,550
Lovely story.

810
01:20:58,759 --> 01:21:04,182
Read some of the inscriptions.

811
01:21:15,407 --> 01:21:18,036
Make a wish?

812
01:21:18,245 --> 01:21:20,372
Tell the doctor?

813
01:21:20,580 --> 01:21:26,047
Anyway, the chances of it
being granted are very slight.

814
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:28,634
Well, what now?

815
01:21:28,843 --> 01:21:31,389
I've heard of a wonderful place
for dancing on a boat.

816
01:21:31,597 --> 01:21:34,768
- The barges down by Sant'Angelo.
- Yes. Couldn't we go there tonight?

817
01:21:34,977 --> 01:21:36,395
- Why not?
- Anything you wish.

818
01:21:36,603 --> 01:21:40,109
Then at midnight,
I'll turn into a pumpkin...

819
01:21:40,317 --> 01:21:42,654
and drive away in my glass slipper.

820
01:21:42,863 --> 01:21:45,283
And that'll be the end of the fairy tale.

821
01:21:45,492 --> 01:21:49,622
- Well, I guess Irving has to go now.
- I do?

822
01:21:49,831 --> 01:21:54,128
That big business development of yours
that you have to attend to.

823
01:21:54,337 --> 01:21:57,008
- The development.
- Can't afford not to take care of that.

824
01:21:57,216 --> 01:22:00,053
Yeah.
I'll see you later, Smitty.

825
01:22:00,262 --> 01:22:05,729
- Good luck with the big development.
- Thanks.

826
01:22:28,677 --> 01:22:34,143
Two, please.

827
01:23:44,161 --> 01:23:46,371
Hello.

828
01:23:46,580 --> 01:23:52,046
Hello.

829
01:24:03,187 --> 01:24:05,941
Mr. Bradley,
if you don't mind my saying so...

830
01:24:06,149 --> 01:24:09,530
- I think you are a ringer.
- A what?

831
01:24:09,738 --> 01:24:12,492
Thanks very much.

832
01:24:12,700 --> 01:24:18,125
You've spent the whole day doing things
I've always wanted to. Why?

833
01:24:18,209 --> 01:24:20,169
I don't know.
It seemed the thing to do.

834
01:24:20,378 --> 01:24:24,843
I never heard of anybody so kind.

835
01:24:25,051 --> 01:24:26,971
It wasn't any trouble.

836
01:24:27,179 --> 01:24:32,646
Or so completely unselfish.

837
01:24:35,233 --> 01:24:40,699
Let's have a drink at the bar.

838
01:24:43,244 --> 01:24:47,667
There you are!
I look for you a long time.

839
01:24:47,876 --> 01:24:51,381
I think maybe you not come.

840
01:24:51,590 --> 01:24:53,049
Off!
All off!

841
01:24:53,258 --> 01:24:56,179
It's nice without, isn't it?
Cool.

842
01:24:56,387 --> 01:24:59,976
- Very, very good.
- This is Mr. Bradley.

843
01:25:00,185 --> 01:25:02,188
I Mario Delani.

844
01:25:02,396 --> 01:25:05,359
- Old friends?
- Yes. He cut my hair this afternoon.

845
01:25:05,568 --> 01:25:08,405
He invited me here tonight.

846
01:25:08,614 --> 01:25:10,575
Well, what did you say the name was?

847
01:25:10,783 --> 01:25:13,369
Delani.
Mario Delani.

848
01:25:13,578 --> 01:25:15,915
I'm very glad to know you.

849
01:25:16,124 --> 01:25:19,045
Me too.

850
01:25:19,253 --> 01:25:23,509
May I enjoy myself the pleasure?

851
01:25:23,719 --> 01:25:26,180
- Do you mind?
- No, no. Go right ahead.

852
01:25:26,388 --> 01:25:31,854
Thank you.

853
01:25:51,800 --> 01:25:54,095
- Did I miss anything?
- You're just in time, pal.

854
01:25:54,303 --> 01:25:58,059
- Who's Smitty dancing with?
- Her barber.

855
01:25:58,268 --> 01:26:00,980
Cut her hair this afternoon,
made a date for tonight.

856
01:26:01,188 --> 01:26:06,654
The princess and the barber.

857
01:27:13,792 --> 01:27:19,216
What is it?

858
01:27:44,668 --> 01:27:50,093
August.

859
01:27:54,016 --> 01:27:59,480
Thank you!

860
01:27:59,940 --> 01:28:05,406
Bye.

861
01:28:13,877 --> 01:28:17,214
Your Highness.

862
01:28:17,423 --> 01:28:19,426
You'll dance quietly towards the entrance.

863
01:28:19,635 --> 01:28:21,804
- There is a car waiting.
- No.

864
01:28:22,013 --> 01:28:25,852
- Your Highness, please.
- You've made a mistake.

865
01:28:26,061 --> 01:28:28,481
Let me go.
Will you let me go?

866
01:28:28,689 --> 01:28:34,155
Mr. Bradley! Let me go!
Mr. Bradley!

867
01:29:48,178 --> 01:29:53,644
Hit him again, Smitty!

868
01:29:59,861 --> 01:30:02,489
- Joe, here are my car keys.
- Police, police. Come on.

869
01:30:02,697 --> 01:30:08,122
The other side of the bridge.

870
01:31:15,968 --> 01:31:18,013
- All right?
- Fine. How are you?

871
01:31:18,221 --> 01:31:23,688
Fine.

872
01:31:25,357 --> 01:31:27,486
Say, you know, you were great back there.

873
01:31:27,694 --> 01:31:33,160
You weren't so bad yourself.

874
01:31:59,197 --> 01:32:04,663
I guess we better get Irving's car
and get out of here.

875
01:32:23,189 --> 01:32:25,024
<i>This is the American hour from Rome...</i>

876
01:32:25,233 --> 01:32:30,658
<i>continuing our program
of musical selections.</i>

877
01:32:53,775 --> 01:32:59,199
- Everything ruined?
- No. They'll be dry in a minute.

878
01:33:01,243 --> 01:33:05,708
Suits you.
You should always wear my clothes.

879
01:33:05,917 --> 01:33:11,383
It seems I do.

880
01:33:12,133 --> 01:33:16,056
I thought a little wine might be good.

881
01:33:16,264 --> 01:33:19,603
- Shall I cook something?
- No kitchen. Nothing to cook.

882
01:33:20,896 --> 01:33:23,274
- I always eat out.
- Do you like that?

883
01:33:23,484 --> 01:33:28,950
Well, life isn't always
what one likes, is it?

884
01:33:30,410 --> 01:33:35,876
No, it isn't.

885
01:33:41,175 --> 01:33:43,095
- Tired?
- A little.

886
01:33:43,303 --> 01:33:46,015
- You've had quite a day.
- A wonderful day.

887
01:33:46,224 --> 01:33:49,186
<i>This is the American hour from Rome
broadcasting a special news bulletin...</i>

888
01:33:49,395 --> 01:33:51,189
<i>in English and Italian.</i>

889
01:33:51,398 --> 01:33:54,902
<i>Tonight there is no further word from
the bedside of Princess Ann in Rome...</i>

890
01:33:55,111 --> 01:33:59,869
<i>where she was taken ill yesterday on the
last leg of her European goodwill tour.</i>

891
01:34:00,077 --> 01:34:02,873
<i>This has given rise to rumors
that her condition may be serious...</i>

892
01:34:03,081 --> 01:34:08,547
<i>which is causing alarm and anxiety
among the people in her country.</i>

893
01:34:10,925 --> 01:34:13,012
- The news can wait till tomorrow.
- Yes.

894
01:34:13,221 --> 01:34:18,686
May I have a little more wine?

895
01:34:19,021 --> 01:34:22,192
I'm sorry I couldn't cook us some dinner.

896
01:34:22,400 --> 01:34:24,403
Did you learn how in school?

897
01:34:24,612 --> 01:34:27,866
I'm a good cook.
I could earn my living at it.

898
01:34:28,074 --> 01:34:30,871
I can sew, too, and clean a house and iron.

899
01:34:31,080 --> 01:34:34,793
I learned to do all those things.
I just haven't had the chance...

900
01:34:35,001 --> 01:34:40,432
to do it for anyone.

901
01:34:40,467 --> 01:34:44,890
Well, looks like I'll have to move...

902
01:34:45,099 --> 01:34:50,524
and get myself a place with a kitchen.

903
01:34:52,401 --> 01:34:57,867
Yes.

904
01:35:19,481 --> 01:35:24,947
I shall have to go now.

905
01:35:41,512 --> 01:35:46,936
There's... something
that I want to tell you.

906
01:35:49,441 --> 01:35:51,276
No, please.

907
01:35:51,485 --> 01:35:56,951
Nothing.

908
01:36:07,216 --> 01:36:12,682
I must go and get dressed.

909
01:36:49,776 --> 01:36:55,243
Stop at the next corner, please.

910
01:37:10,639 --> 01:37:13,310
Here?

911
01:37:13,518 --> 01:37:18,985
Yes.

912
01:37:23,491 --> 01:37:28,916
I have to leave you now.

913
01:37:31,878 --> 01:37:37,344
I'm going to that corner there and turn.

914
01:37:37,844 --> 01:37:41,725
You must stay in the car and drive away.

915
01:37:41,934 --> 01:37:46,273
Promise not to watch me
go beyond the corner.

916
01:37:46,482 --> 01:37:51,155
Just drive away and leave me...

917
01:37:51,364 --> 01:37:56,830
as I leave you.

918
01:37:59,667 --> 01:38:03,464
All right.

919
01:38:03,673 --> 01:38:09,139
I don't know how to say good-bye.

920
01:38:09,431 --> 01:38:14,062
I can't think of any words.

921
01:38:14,271 --> 01:38:19,737
Don't try.

922
01:40:08,559 --> 01:40:10,644
Your Royal Highness...

923
01:40:10,853 --> 01:40:16,320
Twenty-four hours...
they can't all be blank.

924
01:40:17,864 --> 01:40:20,576
They are not.

925
01:40:20,784 --> 01:40:23,705
But what explanation
am I to offer Their Majesties?

926
01:40:23,914 --> 01:40:29,379
I was indisposed.
I am better.

927
01:40:30,048 --> 01:40:34,846
Ma'am, you must appreciate
that I have my duty to perform...

928
01:40:35,055 --> 01:40:38,268
just as Your Royal Highness has her duty.

929
01:40:38,477 --> 01:40:42,232
Your Excellency,
I trust you will not find it necessary...

930
01:40:42,440 --> 01:40:44,735
to use that word again.

931
01:40:44,944 --> 01:40:50,368
Were I not completely aware of my duty
to my family and my country...

932
01:40:50,451 --> 01:40:55,876
I would not have come back tonight...

933
01:40:58,797 --> 01:41:04,222
or, indeed, ever again.

934
01:41:07,977 --> 01:41:09,771
And now...

935
01:41:09,980 --> 01:41:15,404
since I understand we have
a very full schedule today...

936
01:41:15,696 --> 01:41:21,162
you have my permission to withdraw.

937
01:41:34,013 --> 01:41:39,438
No milk and crackers.

938
01:41:44,321 --> 01:41:49,785
That will be all, thank you, Countess.

939
01:42:48,202 --> 01:42:51,499
- Is it true? Did you really get it?
- Did I get what?

940
01:42:51,708 --> 01:42:54,586
The princess story, the exclusive.
Did you get it?

941
01:42:54,795 --> 01:42:57,757
- No, I didn't get it.
- What? But that's impossible.

942
01:42:57,966 --> 01:43:00,686
- Have a cup of coffee or something?
- Joe, you can't hold out on me.

943
01:43:00,846 --> 01:43:03,933
- Who's holding out on you?
- You are. I know too much.

944
01:43:04,142 --> 01:43:07,104
First, you come into my office and ask
about an exclusive on the princess.

945
01:43:07,314 --> 01:43:10,985
Next, you disappear. Then I get the rumor
from my contact at the embassy...

946
01:43:11,193 --> 01:43:13,633
that the princess isn't sick at all
and she's out on the town.

947
01:43:13,696 --> 01:43:16,993
What kind of newspaperman are you?
You believe every two-bit rumor?

948
01:43:17,202 --> 01:43:21,876
Yeah, and a lot of other rumors about
a shindig on a barge down by the river...

949
01:43:22,084 --> 01:43:23,879
and the arrest
of eight secret service men...

950
01:43:24,087 --> 01:43:26,214
from a country which shall be nameless.

951
01:43:26,423 --> 01:43:29,218
And then comes the news
of the lady's miraculous recovery.

952
01:43:29,427 --> 01:43:31,513
It all adds up.

953
01:43:31,722 --> 01:43:34,722
And don't think by playing hard-to-get
you'll raise the price of that story.

954
01:43:34,810 --> 01:43:37,814
A deal's a deal.
Now, come on, come on, come on.

955
01:43:38,023 --> 01:43:43,489
- Where is that story?
- I have no story.

956
01:43:44,199 --> 01:43:48,287
Then what was the idea of...

957
01:43:48,496 --> 01:43:50,958
Man, wait till you see these!

958
01:43:51,167 --> 01:43:53,219
Hiya, Mr. Hennessy.
You got here at the right time.

959
01:43:53,227 --> 01:43:55,116
Wait'll you get a look...

960
01:43:56,925 --> 01:43:57,968
What's the idea?

961
01:43:58,177 --> 01:44:00,847
What do you mean charging
in here and spilling things?

962
01:44:01,056 --> 01:44:02,516
- Who's spilling?
- You did!

963
01:44:02,724 --> 01:44:05,561
I spoke to you about that once before,
don't you remember?

964
01:44:05,770 --> 01:44:08,775
- Joe, look at my pants.
- Come in here and dry 'em off.

965
01:44:08,983 --> 01:44:12,572
Nuts to that.
Hey, did you tell him about Smitty?

966
01:44:12,781 --> 01:44:13,658
Smitty?

967
01:44:13,866 --> 01:44:16,577
Mr. Hennessy, wait till...

968
01:44:16,786 --> 01:44:22,252
There you go again, Irving.

969
01:44:23,379 --> 01:44:25,882
All right, save that till later.
You're here early anyway.

970
01:44:26,091 --> 01:44:29,888
- Why don't you go home and... shave?
- Shave?

971
01:44:30,097 --> 01:44:33,184
Or else keep quiet till Mr. Hennessy
and I are finished talking.

972
01:44:33,393 --> 01:44:35,938
Hey, what kind of a routine is that?

973
01:44:36,147 --> 01:44:38,066
What are you two guys up to?
Who's Smitty?

974
01:44:38,275 --> 01:44:40,320
He's a guy that we met.
You wouldn't care for him.

975
01:44:40,529 --> 01:44:43,257
- What am I supposed to look at?
- Just a couple of Irving's dames.

976
01:44:43,365 --> 01:44:45,369
You wouldn't like 'em.

977
01:44:45,578 --> 01:44:47,039
Maybe you would.

978
01:44:47,247 --> 01:44:50,376
Don't change the subject. When you
came back into my office yesterday...

979
01:44:50,585 --> 01:44:53,922
Yesterday I thought I had
a good lead, but I was wrong.

980
01:44:54,131 --> 01:44:59,555
That's all there is to it.
There is no story.

981
01:45:01,309 --> 01:45:04,730
She's holding the press interview today.
Same time, same place.

982
01:45:04,938 --> 01:45:08,943
Maybe that's one story you can get.

983
01:45:09,152 --> 01:45:12,156
- And you owe me 500 bucks!
- Take it out of my salary.

984
01:45:12,366 --> 01:45:17,831
- Fifty bucks a week.
- Don't think I won't.

985
01:45:18,333 --> 01:45:21,629
Hey, what gives?
Have we had a better offer?

986
01:45:21,837 --> 01:45:27,261
Irving, I don't know
just how to tell you this, but...

987
01:45:27,512 --> 01:45:31,309
Wait till I sit down.

988
01:45:31,518 --> 01:45:36,984
Well, in regard to the story
that goes with these...

989
01:45:39,237 --> 01:45:44,703
- There is no story.
- Why not?

990
01:45:44,994 --> 01:45:50,461
I mean, not as far as I'm concerned.

991
01:45:59,515 --> 01:46:02,854
Hey, the pictures came out pretty well.

992
01:46:03,062 --> 01:46:08,487
You want to have a look at 'em?

993
01:46:15,413 --> 01:46:19,794
How about a blowup
from a negative that size?

994
01:46:20,004 --> 01:46:22,339
That's her first cigarette.

995
01:46:22,548 --> 01:46:27,056
Yeah.
Hey, the mouth of truth.

996
01:46:27,264 --> 01:46:29,433
You want to know the caption
I had in mind there?

997
01:46:29,641 --> 01:46:33,230
"Barber cuts in."

998
01:46:33,439 --> 01:46:36,251
Here's the one I figured would be
the key shot for the whole layout...

999
01:46:36,359 --> 01:46:40,783
- "The wall where wishes come true."
- Joe, that's good.

1000
01:46:40,992 --> 01:46:44,914
Lead off with that,
then follow up with the wishes.

1001
01:46:45,122 --> 01:46:48,919
I dug that up out of the file.
"Princess inspects police."

1002
01:46:49,127 --> 01:46:50,755
Yeah.

1003
01:46:50,963 --> 01:46:54,052
"Police inspects princess."

1004
01:46:54,260 --> 01:46:59,684
How about... Wait.
I got a topper for you.

1005
01:47:01,521 --> 01:47:05,317
- Is that a shot?
- What a picture!

1006
01:47:05,526 --> 01:47:07,779
"Bodyguard gets body blow."

1007
01:47:07,987 --> 01:47:11,243
How about this?
"Crowned head."

1008
01:47:11,451 --> 01:47:16,876
I get it!
That's... Joe, you got...

1009
01:47:21,048 --> 01:47:23,218
She's fair game, Joe.

1010
01:47:23,427 --> 01:47:28,267
It's always open season on princesses.

1011
01:47:28,475 --> 01:47:30,813
You must be out of your mind.

1012
01:47:31,021 --> 01:47:32,857
Yeah, I know, but...

1013
01:47:33,066 --> 01:47:37,822
Look, I can't prevent you from
selling the pictures if you want to.

1014
01:47:38,030 --> 01:47:43,456
- You'll get a good price for 'em.
- Yeah!

1015
01:47:47,545 --> 01:47:50,340
You going to the interview?

1016
01:47:50,549 --> 01:47:54,846
- Are you going?
- Yeah. It's an assignment, isn't it?

1017
01:47:55,054 --> 01:48:00,480
Yeah.

1018
01:48:01,189 --> 01:48:06,655
I'll see you.

1019
01:48:17,587 --> 01:48:23,054
It ain't much, but it's home.

1020
01:48:30,688 --> 01:48:36,154
Ladies and gentlemen, please approach.

1021
01:49:03,235 --> 01:49:08,701
Her Royal Highness.

1022
01:49:33,904 --> 01:49:35,697
Your Royal Highness...

1023
01:49:35,906 --> 01:49:41,372
the ladies and gentlemen of the press.

1024
01:50:15,420 --> 01:50:16,714
Ladies and gentlemen...

1025
01:50:16,923 --> 01:50:20,053
Her Royal Highness
will now answer your questions.

1026
01:50:20,262 --> 01:50:22,055
I believe at the outset, Your Highness...

1027
01:50:22,264 --> 01:50:26,145
that I should express
the pleasure of all of us...

1028
01:50:26,353 --> 01:50:31,235
at your recovery from the recent illness.

1029
01:50:31,443 --> 01:50:33,739
Thank you.

1030
01:50:33,948 --> 01:50:36,535
Does Your Highness believe
that federation...

1031
01:50:36,743 --> 01:50:42,167
would be a possible solution
to Europe's economic problems?

1032
01:50:42,585 --> 01:50:45,255
I am in favor of any measure...

1033
01:50:45,463 --> 01:50:50,221
which would lead to closer
cooperation in Europe.

1034
01:50:50,430 --> 01:50:53,100
And what, in the opinion
of Your Highness...

1035
01:50:53,309 --> 01:50:57,606
is the outlook for friendship
among nations?

1036
01:50:57,814 --> 01:51:02,196
I have every faith in it...

1037
01:51:02,405 --> 01:51:07,871
as I have faith
in relations between people.

1038
01:51:11,709 --> 01:51:17,175
May I say, speaking
for my own press service...

1039
01:51:17,383 --> 01:51:20,180
we believe that Your Highness's faith...

1040
01:51:20,388 --> 01:51:25,437
will not be unjustified.

1041
01:51:25,646 --> 01:51:31,070
I am so glad to hear you say it.

1042
01:51:31,362 --> 01:51:36,787
Which of the cities visited
did Your Highness enjoy the most?

1043
01:51:44,631 --> 01:51:48,971
Each in its own way...

1044
01:51:49,179 --> 01:51:54,270
Each in its own way was... unforgettable.

1045
01:51:54,478 --> 01:51:58,776
It would be difficult to...

1046
01:51:58,986 --> 01:52:04,450
Rome.
By all means, Rome.

1047
01:52:06,829 --> 01:52:11,460
I will cherish my visit here in memory...

1048
01:52:11,669 --> 01:52:17,136
as long as I live.

1049
01:52:19,931 --> 01:52:25,022
Despite your indisposition, Your Highness?

1050
01:52:25,230 --> 01:52:27,775
Despite that.

1051
01:52:27,984 --> 01:52:33,451
Photographs may now be taken.

1052
01:52:59,154 --> 01:53:01,073
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

1053
01:53:01,281 --> 01:53:03,911
Thank you very much.

1054
01:53:04,119 --> 01:53:09,544
I would now like to meet some of
the ladies and gentlemen of the press.

1061

May I present Your Highness...

1062
01:54:31,994 --> 01:54:37,460
