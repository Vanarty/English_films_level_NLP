it is the art of the leader who<br/>is also a brother to his followers.

She loved David. Hated me.

676
00:53:35,710 --> 00:53:37,170
When we were...

677
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:40,710
...presented to my parents<br/>for the daily viewing,

678
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:45,760
she would... she'd pinch me

679
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:50,430
so that I'd cry and be handed back<br/>to her immediately.

680
00:53:53,350 --> 00:53:55,140
And then she would...

687
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:31,720
What about your brother, Johnnie?

688
00:54:32,970 --> 00:54:35,430
Were you close to him?

689
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:39,850
Johnnie... sweet boy.

690
00:54:41,270 --> 00:54:42,940

691
00:54:48,530 --> 00:54:50,200
...epilepsy.

692
00:54:51,700 --> 00:54:56,040
And he was... different.

693
00:54:58,290 --> 00:55:01,330

...you're the first<br/>ordinary Englishman...

701
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:35,740
- Australian.<br/>- ...I've ever really spoken to.

702

703

and I see the, you know,<br/>the common man staring at me, I...

704
00:55:47,210 --> 00:55:49,590
...I'm struck by how little<br/>I know of his life

705
00:55:49,670 --> 00:55:52,630
and how little he knows of mine.

706
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:56,140
- Thank you.<br/>- What are friends for?

707
00:55:59,430 --> 00:56:01,190
I wouldn't know.

708
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:08,190
[Bertie]<br/>I sifted seven...

709
00:56:09,570 --> 00:56:13,570
...thick-stalked thistles<br/>through a strong, thick sieve.

710
00:56:13,660 --> 00:56:17,240
- I sifted seven thick-stalked...<br/>- That's enough now, darling.

711
00:56:17,330 --> 00:56:21,000
Listen, I have to keep doing this,<br/>it's awful. I sifted seven...

712
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:23,420
- Oh, no.<br/>- ...thick-stalked...

717
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:42,140
I'm getting plump.

718
00:56:43,310 --> 00:56:44,770
Well, you seldom cook.

Oh, how lovely to see you both.

00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:11,170
Welcome to our little country shack.

727
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:14,510
I came at the invitation of the King.

00:57:19,260 --> 00:57:20,850
Your Majesty.

729
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:24,600
- You all right?<br/>- Sorry we're late.

Very nice to see you... Mrs. Simpson.

Very nice.

Hello, David. Making some...

734
00:57:45,210 --> 00:57:47,960
Yes, I'm not quite finished yet.

735
00:57:52,090 --> 00:57:54,420
Don't tell me I behaved badly,<br/>Mr. Churchill.

- David, I've been trying to see you.<br/>- I've been terribly busy.

746
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:47,020
- Doing what?<br/>- Kinging.

747
00:58:47,100 --> 00:58:51,770

00:59:43,410 --> 00:59:46,290
- I'm not having her as my mistress.<br/>- The Church doesn't recognize divorce,

- ...of Baltimore.<br/>- That's not right.

824

- Queen Wallis of Baltimore.<br/>- Unthinkable.

- Can he do it?<br/>- Absolutely not.

826

But he's going to anyway.<br/>All hell's broken loose.

01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:16,700
- Can't they just carry on privately?<br/>- If only they would.

Is it that serious?

833
01:03:36,100 --> 01:03:40,230
- Your place may well be on the throne.<br/>- I am not an alternative to my brother.

834

- You can outshine David.<br/>- Don't take liberties!

835
01:03:44,110 --> 01:03:46,650

836
01:03:46,730 --> 01:03:48,610

Every monarch in history

1012
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:40,630
has succeeded someone who's dead

1013
01:18:40,710 --> 01:18:43,420
Or just about to be.

1014
01:18:45,420 --> 01:18:51,140
My predecessor is not only alive,<br/>but very much so.

1015
01:18:55,100 --> 01:18:56,890
It's a bloody mess.

1016
01:18:58,100 --> 01:19:00,480
Couldn't even give them<br/>a Christmas speech.

1017
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:03,570
- Like your dad used to do?<br/>- Precisely.

1018
01:19:03,650 --> 01:19:06,280
He's not here anymore.

1019
01:19:08,820 --> 01:19:11,410
Yes, he is.<br/>He's on that shilling I gave you.

1020
01:19:11,490 --> 01:19:15,620
[Chuckles]<br/>Easy enough to give away.

1021
01:19:15,700 --> 01:19:18,750
You don't have to carry him<br/>around in your pocket.

1022
01:19:18,830 --> 01:19:20,330
Or your brother.

1023
01:19:20,420 --> 01:19:24,170
You don't need to be afraid<br/>of the things you were afraid of

1024
01:19:24,250 --> 01:19:26,760
when you were five.

1025
01:19:26,840 --> 01:19:28,970
[Sighs]

1026
01:19:32,350 --> 01:19:34,760
You're very much your own man, Bertie.

1027
01:19:36,270 --> 01:19:37,850
Am I?

1028
01:19:42,230 --> 01:19:44,860
- Your face is next, mate.<br/>- [Myrtle] Lionel, dear!

1029
01:19:45,940 --> 01:19:46,940
Myrtle.

1030
01:19:47,030 --> 01:19:50,570
- [Bertie] Is this your wife?<br/>- [Lionel] Yes.

1031
01:19:51,110 --> 01:19:53,200
Bertie. Come here.

1032
01:19:54,530 --> 01:19:57,200
- Are you all right, Logue?<br/>- Yes.

1033
01:19:59,290 --> 01:20:02,460
- [Bertie] Shouldn't we go through?<br/>- [Lionel] Trust me, it's important.

1034
01:20:03,960 --> 01:20:07,630
- [Bertie] What is it?<br/>- Oh!

1035
01:20:07,710 --> 01:20:10,220
- You're...<br/>- It's "Your Majesty" the first time.

1036
01:20:10,300 --> 01:20:12,640
After that, it's "Ma'am." As in "ham."

1037
01:20:12,720 --> 01:20:14,390
Not "malm" as in "palm."

1038
01:20:15,850 --> 01:20:17,970
I haven't told her about us.

1039
01:20:18,060 --> 01:20:19,850
Sit down, relax.

1040
01:20:19,940 --> 01:20:24,440
I'm told your husband<br/>calls my husband Bertie.

1041
01:20:24,520 --> 01:20:26,860
And my husband calls<br/>your husband Lionel.

1042
01:20:26,940 --> 01:20:28,440
I trust you won't call me Liz.

1043
01:20:29,490 --> 01:20:33,450
Your Majesty, you may<br/>call me Mrs. Logue, ma'am.

1044
01:20:33,530 --> 01:20:35,410
Very nice to meet you, Mrs. Logue.

1045
01:20:37,910 --> 01:20:40,040
- Logue, we can't stay here all day.<br/>- Yes, we can.

1046
01:20:40,120 --> 01:20:42,290
- Logue!<br/>- I need to wait for the right moment.

1047
01:20:42,370 --> 01:20:45,210
- Logue, you're being a coward.<br/>- You're damn right.

1048
01:20:46,960 --> 01:20:48,130
Get out there, man.

1049
01:20:50,470 --> 01:20:52,880
Hello, Myrtle, darling.

1050
01:20:53,680 --> 01:20:55,010
You're early.

1051
01:20:55,100 --> 01:20:59,140
I believe you two have met,<br/>but I don't think you know...

1052
01:21:00,270 --> 01:21:03,980
...king George the Sixth.<br/>- It's very nice to meet you.

1053
01:21:07,900 --> 01:21:11,070
Will Their Majesties<br/>be staying to dinner?

1054
01:21:12,150 --> 01:21:16,200
We'd love to, such a treat,<br/>but alas a...

1055
01:21:16,280 --> 01:21:19,030
...previous engagement. What a pity.

1056
01:21:34,130 --> 01:21:37,760
- Archbishop.<br/>- Welcome, Your Majesty.

1057
01:21:38,310 --> 01:21:41,680
What a glorious transformation, sir.

1058
01:21:41,770 --> 01:21:45,140
I hope you'll forgive us<br/>if we continue our preparations?

1059
01:21:46,150 --> 01:21:51,940
Now, allow me to guide you<br/>through the ceremony.

1060
01:21:56,160 --> 01:22:01,240
We begin, of course,<br/>at the West door into the nave.

1061
01:22:02,700 --> 01:22:06,750
I see all your pronouncements<br/>are to be broadcast, Archbishop.

1062
01:22:06,830 --> 01:22:09,290
Ah, yes. Wireless.

1063
01:22:09,380 --> 01:22:11,750
It is, indeed, a Pandora's box,

1064
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:16,050
and I'm afraid I've also had<br/>to permit the newsreel cameras.

1065
01:22:16,130 --> 01:22:19,760
The product of which<br/>I shall personally edit.

1066
01:22:19,850 --> 01:22:22,350
Without momentary hesitations.

1067
01:22:22,430 --> 01:22:26,140
This is Dr. Logue of Harley Street.

1068
01:22:26,230 --> 01:22:30,020
He's... my speech therapist.

1069
01:22:30,570 --> 01:22:33,860
- Your Grace.<br/>- Had I known that Your Majesty

1070
01:22:33,940 --> 01:22:36,950
was seeking assistance, I should<br/>have made my own recommendation.

1071
01:22:37,030 --> 01:22:39,450
Dr. Logue will...

1072
01:22:40,330 --> 01:22:42,410
...will be attending the Coronation.

1073
01:22:42,490 --> 01:22:47,290
Of course I'll speak to the Dean,<br/>but it will be extremely difficult.

1074
01:22:47,370 --> 01:22:49,210
I should like the...

1075
01:22:50,750 --> 01:22:54,340
...doctor to be seated in the...

1076
01:22:54,420 --> 01:22:55,630
...King's Box.

1077
01:22:56,630 --> 01:22:59,720
[Archbishop] But members of your family<br/>will be seated there, sir.

1078
01:22:59,800 --> 01:23:01,600
That is why it is suitable.

1079
01:23:03,850 --> 01:23:05,850
And now, if you don't mind, Your Grace,<br/>we need the premises.

1080
01:23:05,930 --> 01:23:08,480
My dear fellow,<br/>this is Westminster Abbey.

1081
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:10,600
The Church must prepare His Majesty.

1082
01:23:10,690 --> 01:23:13,610
My preparations are equally<br/>as important.

1083
01:23:17,740 --> 01:23:20,570
With complete privacy,<br/>if you don't mind.

1084
01:23:22,330 --> 01:23:24,580
Those are my wishes, Your Grace.

1085
01:23:25,790 --> 01:23:29,790
I will place the Abbey<br/>at Your Majesty's disposal,

1086
01:23:29,870 --> 01:23:33,420
this evening. Your Majesty.

1087
01:23:52,940 --> 01:23:55,770
[Indistinct Murmuring]

1088
01:24:03,950 --> 01:24:07,910
I can't believe I'm walking<br/>on Chaucer and Handel and Dickens.

1089
01:24:11,420 --> 01:24:13,500
Everything all right?<br/>Let's get cracking.

1090
01:24:15,300 --> 01:24:19,380
I'm not here to rehearse, Dr. Logue.

1091
01:24:22,050 --> 01:24:23,970
Call me Lionel.

1092
01:24:24,970 --> 01:24:29,140
True, you... never...

1093
01:24:30,100 --> 01:24:32,560
...called yourself Doctor. I did that...

1094
01:24:34,980 --> 01:24:36,110
...for you.

1095
01:24:39,150 --> 01:24:40,900
No training.

1096
01:24:40,990 --> 01:24:43,820
No diploma, no...

1097
01:24:46,910 --> 01:24:48,370
...qualifications.

1098
01:24:48,450 --> 01:24:52,290
Just... a great deal of nerve.

1099
01:24:53,330 --> 01:24:55,710
The Star Chamber inquisition, is it?

1100
01:24:55,790 --> 01:24:57,710
You asked for trust.

1101
01:24:57,800 --> 01:25:02,260
And... total equality.

1102
01:25:02,340 --> 01:25:05,760
Bertie, I heard you at Wembley.<br/>I was there.

1103
01:25:06,850 --> 01:25:09,520
My son Laurie said, "Dad, do you think<br/>you could help that poor man?"

1104
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:13,060
- What, as a failed actor?<br/>- It's true.

1105
01:25:13,140 --> 01:25:18,820
I'm not a doctor.<br/>And yes, I acted, a bit.

1106
01:25:19,230 --> 01:25:23,360
Well, I recited in pubs.<br/>I taught elocution in schools.

1107
01:25:23,450 --> 01:25:25,030
When the Great War came,

1108
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:27,660
all our soldiers were returning<br/>to Australia from the front,

1109
01:25:27,740 --> 01:25:31,370
a lot of them shell-shocked,<br/>unable to speak.

1110
01:25:31,450 --> 01:25:33,870
Somebody said, Lionel,<br/>"You're very good at this speech stuff.

1111
01:25:33,960 --> 01:25:36,630
Do you think you could possibly<br/>help these poor buggers?"

1112
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:40,420
I did muscle therapy,<br/>exercises, relaxation,

1113
01:25:40,510 --> 01:25:42,760
but I knew I had to go deeper.

1114
01:25:44,340 --> 01:25:46,760
Those poor young blokes<br/>had cried out in fear.

1115
01:25:46,850 --> 01:25:49,100
No one was listening to them.

1116
01:25:50,640 --> 01:25:53,730
My job was to give them faith<br/>in their own voice,

1117
01:25:53,810 --> 01:25:57,440
and let them know that<br/>a friend was listening.

1118
01:25:58,770 --> 01:26:01,860
That must ring<br/>a few bells with you, Bertie.

1119
01:26:06,240 --> 01:26:08,450
You give a very noble<br/>account of yourself.

1120
01:26:08,530 --> 01:26:12,490
- Make inquiries. It's all true.<br/>- Inquiries have been made.

1121
01:26:12,580 --> 01:26:16,330
You have no idea who I have<br/>breathing down my neck.

1122
01:26:17,500 --> 01:26:20,090
I vouched for you, and you have no...

1123
01:26:23,170 --> 01:26:25,590
- ...credentials.<br/>- But lots of success.

1124
01:26:25,680 --> 01:26:29,010
I can't show you a certificate.<br/>There was no training then.

1125
01:26:29,100 --> 01:26:30,930
Everything I know,<br/>I know from experience.

1126
01:26:31,010 --> 01:26:34,640
And that war was some experience.

1127
01:26:37,100 --> 01:26:39,350
My plaque says,<br/>"L. Logue, Speech Defects."

1128
01:26:39,440 --> 01:26:42,440
Not "Doctor."<br/>There are no letters after my name.

1129
01:26:47,240 --> 01:26:49,870
- Lock me in the Tower.<br/>- I would if I could.

1130
01:26:49,950 --> 01:26:51,620
- On what charge?<br/>- Fraud.

1131
01:26:51,700 --> 01:26:55,370
With war looming, you've saddled<br/>this nation with a voiceless...

1132
01:26:55,460 --> 01:26:59,710
...King. You've destroyed<br/>the happiness of my family,

1133
01:26:59,790 --> 01:27:05,010
all for the sake of ensnaring<br/>a star... patient you couldn't...

1134
01:27:05,090 --> 01:27:07,590
...possibly hope to assist.

1135
01:27:08,640 --> 01:27:10,640
It'll be like mad...

1136
01:27:12,510 --> 01:27:14,560
...King George the Third.

1137
01:27:15,560 --> 01:27:18,980
I'll be... Mad King...

1138
01:27:20,020 --> 01:27:22,270
...George the Stammerer...

1139
01:27:24,150 --> 01:27:27,820
...who let his people down<br/>so badly in their hour of need.

1140
01:27:28,820 --> 01:27:31,410
What are you doing? Get up!<br/>You can't sit there! Get up!

1141
01:27:31,490 --> 01:27:34,410
- Why not? It's a chair.<br/>- No, it... That is not a chair!

1142
01:27:34,490 --> 01:27:36,500
That is... That...

1143
01:27:36,580 --> 01:27:40,250
- That is Saint Edward's chair.<br/>- People have carved their names on it.

1144
01:27:40,330 --> 01:27:41,920
That chair is the seat<br/>on which every King...

1145
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:45,550
- It's held in place by a large rock.<br/>- That is the Stone of Scone!

1146
01:27:45,630 --> 01:27:50,260
- You are trivializing everything.<br/>- I don't care how many royal assholes

1147
01:27:50,340 --> 01:27:52,340
- ...have sat on this chair.<br/>- Listen to me! Listen to me!

1148
01:27:52,430 --> 01:27:54,720
- Listen to you? By what right?<br/>- By Divine Right, if you must.

1149
01:27:54,810 --> 01:27:55,930
- I am your King!<br/>- No, you're not.

1150
01:27:56,020 --> 01:27:58,310
You told me so yourself.<br/>You said you didn't want it.

1151
01:27:58,390 --> 01:27:59,690
Why should I waste my time<br/>listening to you?

1152
01:27:59,770 --> 01:28:02,900
Because I have a right to be heard!<br/>I have a voice!

1153
01:28:08,240 --> 01:28:09,860
Yes, you do.

1154
01:28:19,500 --> 01:28:23,460
You have such perseverance, Bertie.<br/>You're the bravest man I know.

1155
01:28:23,540 --> 01:28:25,840
You'll make a bloody good King.

1156
01:28:33,430 --> 01:28:37,390
- What on earth is going on, sir?<br/>- It's quite all right, Archbishop.

1157
01:28:37,470 --> 01:28:39,140
Mr. Logue, you must know that

1158
01:28:39,230 --> 01:28:43,020
I've found a replacement English<br/>specialist with impeccable credentials.

1159
01:28:43,100 --> 01:28:46,650
Hence, your services<br/>will no longer be required.

1160
01:28:46,730 --> 01:28:48,690
- I'm sorry?<br/>- Your Majesty's function

1161
01:28:48,780 --> 01:28:51,740
is to consult and be advised.<br/>Now, you didn't consult,

1162
01:28:51,820 --> 01:28:57,120
- ...but you have just been advised.<br/>- And now I advise you.

1163
01:28:57,200 --> 01:29:03,120
In this personal matter,<br/>I will make my own decision.

1164
01:29:03,290 --> 01:29:07,960
My concern is for the head<br/>on which I must place the crown.

1165
01:29:08,050 --> 01:29:10,170
I appreciate that, Archbishop.

1166
01:29:11,920 --> 01:29:13,760
But it's my head.

1167
01:29:15,010 --> 01:29:16,970
Your humble servant.

1168
01:29:24,190 --> 01:29:25,770
Thank you, Bertie.

1169
01:29:28,150 --> 01:29:31,610
Shall we rehearse? Come on.<br/>Up on your perch.

1170
01:29:39,040 --> 01:29:42,200
Now, when you and Elizabeth<br/>enter through the West door,

1171
01:29:42,290 --> 01:29:46,420
you will be greeted by the hymn<br/>"I was glad when they said unto me."

1172
01:29:46,500 --> 01:29:49,800
Actually, you won't be that glad because<br/>they do sing it for a very long time.

1173
01:29:51,460 --> 01:29:56,680
Then your friend, the Archbishop,<br/>will ponce up the stairs towards you,

1174
01:29:56,760 --> 01:30:02,060
and say, "Sir, is Your Majesty<br/>willing to take the oath?"

1175
01:30:02,140 --> 01:30:05,640
- "I am willing."<br/>- Well, of course you are.

1176
01:30:05,730 --> 01:30:07,900
I'm gonna see what this sounds like<br/>in the cheap seats,

1177
01:30:07,980 --> 01:30:10,400
so even your old nanny can hear.

1178
01:30:10,480 --> 01:30:15,240
"Will you govern your peoples,<br/>Great Britain, Ireland, Canada,

1179
01:30:15,320 --> 01:30:18,240
Australia and New Zealand,

1180
01:30:18,320 --> 01:30:22,290
according to their lands and customs?"

1181
01:30:22,370 --> 01:30:24,700
- "I SOLEMNLY PROMISE TO DO SO!"<br/>- Louder.

1182
01:30:24,790 --> 01:30:28,580
- I can't hear you up the back.<br/>- "I solemnly promise to do so."

1183
01:30:28,670 --> 01:30:31,750
Very good. "And will you, to your power,

1184
01:30:31,840 --> 01:30:36,930
cause Law and Justice, in Mercy to be<br/>executed in all your judgments?"

1185
01:30:37,010 --> 01:30:38,890
"I will. [Louder] "I WILL!"

1186
01:30:38,970 --> 01:30:42,010
Then there's a very long bit<br/>about upholding the faith. It goes on,

1187
01:30:42,100 --> 01:30:44,850
rubbish, rubbish, rubbish,<br/>to which you finally say...

1188
01:30:44,930 --> 01:30:50,860
"The things which I have...<br/>here before promised,

1189
01:30:50,940 --> 01:30:54,730
I will perform and keep.<br/>So help me God."

1190
01:30:55,320 --> 01:30:58,200
And that's all you say.<br/>Four short responses.

1191
01:30:58,280 --> 01:31:01,700
Kiss the book, sign the oath,<br/>and you're King.

1192
01:31:02,450 --> 01:31:03,450
Easy.

1193
01:31:04,290 --> 01:31:06,120
[Man On Film Speaks Indistinctly]

1194
01:31:16,800 --> 01:31:19,720
You nearly crowned him backwards,<br/>Archbishop.

1195
01:31:21,220 --> 01:31:25,310
Someone had removed the thread<br/>marking the back of the crown, sir.

1196
01:31:25,390 --> 01:31:27,640
Try not to lose the thread, Archbishop.

1197
01:31:28,560 --> 01:31:31,230
[Chuckles]<br/>Archbishop, we're missing Papa.

1198
01:31:33,690 --> 01:31:37,030
- [All] God save the King.<br/>- Very good.

1199
01:31:37,570 --> 01:31:39,280
Very good, Archbishop.

1200
01:31:40,280 --> 01:31:43,780
Well, I hope Your Majesties<br/>are thrilled with the result.

1201
01:31:43,870 --> 01:31:49,000
- You can switch that machine off.<br/>- No, wait. Keep going.

1202
01:31:49,080 --> 01:31:51,460
- Nazism has held its great convention.<br/>- Do take a seat, Archbishop.

1203
01:31:51,540 --> 01:31:53,750
Masses of uniformed men,<br/>stupefying to the eye,

1204
01:31:53,840 --> 01:31:57,340
and incredible to the imagination<br/>have stood in spellbound audience...

...of the Fuhrer.<br/>[Speaking German]

1206
01:32:10,480 --> 01:32:14,020
- Papao Papa, what's he saying?<br/>- [Bertie] Hmm?

1207
01:32:14,110 --> 01:32:18,280
I don't know, but he seems<br/>to be saying it rather well.

1208
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:42,590
Sir... I have asked to see you today

1209
01:32:42,680 --> 01:32:46,810
in order to tender my resignation<br/>as Prime Minister.

1210
01:32:48,270 --> 01:32:51,600
I'm so sorry to hear that,<br/>Mr. Baldwin.

1211
01:32:51,690 --> 01:32:55,360
Neville Chamberlain will<br/>take my place as Prime Minister.

1212
01:32:55,440 --> 01:33:00,030
It's a matter of principle.<br/>I was mistaken.

1213
01:33:00,110 --> 01:33:03,660
I have found it impossible to believe

1214
01:33:03,740 --> 01:33:07,080
that there is any man in the world

1215
01:33:07,160 --> 01:33:12,250
so lacking in moral feeling as Hitler,

1216
01:33:12,330 --> 01:33:16,880
that the world may be hurled<br/>for a second time

1217
01:33:16,960 --> 01:33:20,260
into the abyss of destructive war.

1218
01:33:21,840 --> 01:33:24,680
Churchill was right all along.

1219
01:33:24,760 --> 01:33:27,300
This was always Hitler's intention.

1220
01:33:28,560 --> 01:33:33,180
I'm only very sorry to leave you<br/>at this great time of crisis.

1221
01:33:35,810 --> 01:33:41,820
I'm very much afraid, sir,<br/>that your greatest test is yet to come.

1222
01:33:47,070 --> 01:33:49,410
[Chamberlain On Radio]<br/>I am speaking to you...

1223
01:33:49,490 --> 01:33:54,620
...from the Cabinet room<br/>at 10 Downing Street.

1224
01:33:54,710 --> 01:33:58,960
This morning,<br/>the British ambassador in Berlin

1225
01:33:59,050 --> 01:34:03,050
handed the German government<br/>a final note

1226
01:34:03,130 --> 01:34:08,800
stating that unless<br/>we heard from them by 11:00,

1227
01:34:08,890 --> 01:34:14,020
that they were prepared at once<br/>to withdraw their troops from Poland,

1228
01:34:14,100 --> 01:34:17,440
...a state of war would exist between us.<br/>[Door Shuts]

1229
01:34:19,230 --> 01:34:25,150
I have to tell you now that<br/>no such undertaking has been received,

1230
01:34:25,240 --> 01:34:30,780
and that, consequently, this country<br/>is at war with Germany.

1231
01:34:36,420 --> 01:34:38,880
At last, sir, here is your speech.

1232
01:34:39,750 --> 01:34:41,960
You are on air at six.

1233
01:34:42,050 --> 01:34:46,590
I have timed it<br/>to just under nine minutes.

1234
01:34:46,680 --> 01:34:49,300
The wording is fully approved.

1235
01:34:49,390 --> 01:34:52,100
The Prime Minister<br/>will be joining you for the broadcast,

1236
01:34:52,180 --> 01:34:54,890
which will go out live<br/>across the nation, the Empire

1237
01:34:54,980 --> 01:34:58,310
- ...and to our armed forces.<br/>- Get Logue here immediately.

1238
01:35:12,870 --> 01:35:15,620
- [Laurie] There's the barrage balloons.<br/>- [Lionel] Yes.

1239
01:35:17,370 --> 01:35:20,040
- They got them up there quickly.<br/>- Yeah.

1240

[Air-Raid Siren Wails]<br/>[Indistinct Shouting]

1241
01:35:32,640 --> 01:35:35,350
- Shall we pull over and find a shelter?<br/>- No, no. Go straight there.

1242
01:35:35,430 --> 01:35:36,850
We'll be all right.

1243
01:35:46,320 --> 01:35:48,450
- Yes, sir?<br/>- Lionel Logue.

1244
01:35:48,530 --> 01:35:51,700
Major Hartley is expecting me.<br/>This is my son, Laurie.

1245
01:35:59,330 --> 01:36:01,670
- Thank you, Laurie.<br/>- Good luck, Dad.

1246
01:36:08,010 --> 01:36:09,510
- The King's speech.<br/>- Thank you, sir.

1247
01:36:09,590 --> 01:36:12,430
We have about 40 minutes<br/>to the broadcast.

1248
01:36:14,600 --> 01:36:17,850
Thank you very much. Thank you.

1249
01:36:17,930 --> 01:36:21,690
[Bertie]<br/>There may be dark days ahead...

1250
01:36:22,560 --> 01:36:25,480
...and...<br/>- Try again.

1251
01:36:29,360 --> 01:36:33,660
There may be dark days ahead, and...

1252
01:36:35,030 --> 01:36:38,290
Turn the hesitations into pauses and say<br/>to yourself, "God save the King."

1253
01:36:38,370 --> 01:36:42,040
I say that continuously,<br/>but apparently no one's listening.

1254
01:36:42,120 --> 01:36:45,130
Long pauses are good.<br/>They add solemnity to great occasions.

1255
01:36:45,210 --> 01:36:48,250
Then I'm the solemnest king<br/>who ever lived.

1256
01:36:48,340 --> 01:36:52,880
You know, if I'm a king,<br/>where's my power?

1257
01:36:52,970 --> 01:36:54,800
Can I... can I form a government?

1258
01:36:54,890 --> 01:36:58,260
Can I... can I... levy a tax?

1259
01:36:58,350 --> 01:37:00,810
Declare a... a war? No.

1260
01:37:00,890 --> 01:37:04,100
And yet I'm the seat of all authority.<br/>Why? Because...

1261
01:37:04,690 --> 01:37:07,980
...the nation believes<br/>that when I... I speak,

1262
01:37:08,070 --> 01:37:10,320
I speak for them. But I can't speak.

1263
01:37:12,030 --> 01:37:15,030
Let's take it all again from the top.<br/>"In this grave hour."

1269
01:37:43,440 --> 01:37:45,350
Bounce on to it. "A peoples."

- Prime Minister.<br/>- Your Majesty.

Nice to see you... again so soon.

1290
01:39:13,650 --> 01:39:15,900
Good of you to be here.<br/>I'm sure you have had...

1291
01:39:18,240 --> 01:39:21,370
- ...a rather busy day.<br/>- I hope we have no more interruptions...

Good luck, sir.

1297
01:39:45,430 --> 01:39:48,690
I, too, dread this apparatus.

- I didn't.<br/>- Family secret. Tongue-tied.

1300
01:39:56,900 --> 01:39:59,530
An operation was considered<br/>to be too dangerous.

01:39:59,610 --> 01:40:03,320
I eventually made an asset of it.

...to every household of my...

1335
01:43:31,910 --> 01:43:33,740
...a- peoples...

1336
01:43:36,330 --> 01:43:38,210
...both at home...

1337
01:43:42,380 --> 01:43:44,420
...and overseas...

1338
01:43:53,930 --> 01:43:55,970
...this message...

1339
01:43:56,980 --> 01:44:01,690
...spoken with the same<br/>depth of feeling...

1340
01:44:02,480 --> 01:44:04,480
...for each one of you...

1341
01:44:04,980 --> 01:44:10,070
...as if I were able<br/>to cross your threshold

1342
01:44:10,160 --> 01:44:14,370
and speak to you... myself.

1343
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:22,790
For the second time<br/>in the lives of most of us...

1344
01:44:22,880 --> 01:44:25,420
...we are... at...

1345
01:44:25,500 --> 01:44:26,840
[Mouthing]<br/>Fuck, fuck, fuck!

1346
01:44:26,920 --> 01:44:28,170
...at war.

1347
01:44:29,130 --> 01:44:30,590
[Mouthing]<br/>Very good.

1348
01:44:32,180 --> 01:44:36,430
Over and over again...

1349
01:44:37,520 --> 01:44:40,890
...we have tried to find...

1350
01:44:42,850 --> 01:44:48,690
...a peaceful way out<br/>of the differences...

1351
01:44:49,740 --> 01:44:52,360
...between ourselves...

1352
01:44:52,450 --> 01:44:53,990
...and those...

1353
01:44:54,700 --> 01:45:00,040
...who are now our... enemies.

1354
01:45:02,040 --> 01:45:06,040
But it has been... in vain.

1355
01:45:06,880 --> 01:45:11,920
We have been forced into a conflict,

1356
01:45:12,010 --> 01:45:16,930
for we are called<br/>to meet the challenge of a principle,

1357
01:45:17,010 --> 01:45:21,230
which, if it were to prevail,

1358
01:45:21,310 --> 01:45:25,860
would be fatal to any civilized order

1359
01:45:25,940 --> 01:45:27,980
in the world.

1360
01:45:28,900 --> 01:45:31,570
Such a principle,

1361
01:45:31,650 --> 01:45:37,580
stripped of all disguise,

1362
01:45:37,660 --> 01:45:40,790
is surely the mere...

1363
01:45:43,920 --> 01:45:47,880
...primitive doctrine that might...

1364
01:45:49,420 --> 01:45:51,010
...is right.

1365
01:45:51,970 --> 01:45:57,800
For the sake of all<br/>that we ourselves hold dear,

1366
01:45:57,890 --> 01:46:01,470
it is unthinkable

1367
01:46:01,560 --> 01:46:06,230
that we should refuse to meet...

1368
01:46:06,310 --> 01:46:07,980
...the challenge.

1369
01:46:10,530 --> 01:46:15,280
It is to this high purpose

1370
01:46:15,360 --> 01:46:18,030
that I now call

1371
01:46:18,120 --> 01:46:22,080
my people at home,

1372
01:46:22,160 --> 01:46:26,670
and my peoples across the seas,

1373
01:46:26,750 --> 01:46:31,500
who will make our cause their own.

1374
01:46:31,590 --> 01:46:36,590
I ask them to stand calm

1375
01:46:36,680 --> 01:46:39,850
and firm and united

1376
01:46:39,930 --> 01:46:43,970
in this time of trial.

1377
01:46:44,060 --> 01:46:46,810
The task will be hard.

1378
01:46:47,770 --> 01:46:51,730
There may be dark days ahead,

1379
01:46:51,820 --> 01:46:57,660
and war can no longer be confined

1380
01:46:57,740 --> 01:47:00,030
to the battlefield.

1381
01:47:00,120 --> 01:47:03,120
But we can only do the right

1382
01:47:03,200 --> 01:47:05,790
as we see the right,

1383
01:47:05,870 --> 01:47:09,830
and reverently commit

1384
01:47:09,920 --> 01:47:14,380
Our cause to God.

1385
01:47:16,260 --> 01:47:19,930
If one and all we keep

1386
01:47:20,010 --> 01:47:24,930
resolutely faithful to it,

1387
01:47:25,020 --> 01:47:30,940
then, with God's help,

1388
01:47:31,020 --> 01:47:34,900
we shall... prevail.

1389
01:47:38,360 --> 01:47:42,370
[Long Sigh]<br/>[Indistinct Murmuring]

1390
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:51,630
It was very good, Bertie.

1391
01:47:52,380 --> 01:47:54,300
[Exhales]

1392
01:48:06,480 --> 01:48:09,230
You still stammered on the "W."

1393
01:48:10,150 --> 01:48:14,060
Well, I had to throw in a few,<br/>so they knew it was me.

1394
01:48:18,860 --> 01:48:21,950
Congratulations, Your Majesty.<br/>A true broadcaster.

1395
01:48:22,030 --> 01:48:23,740
[Applause]<br/>Thank you, Mr. Wood.

1396
01:48:26,790 --> 01:48:29,120
- Congratulations, Your Majesty.<br/>- Sir.

1397
01:48:30,080 --> 01:48:33,080
- Congratulations, Your Majesty.<br/>- Thank you.

1398
01:48:43,430 --> 01:48:44,800
Ready.

1399
01:48:45,810 --> 01:48:48,100
- Good?<br/>- Perfect, sir.

1400
01:48:49,270 --> 01:48:52,560
Your first wartime speech.

1401
01:48:52,650 --> 01:48:54,520
Congratulations.

1402
01:48:54,610 --> 01:48:59,690
I expect I shall have to...<br/>do a great deal more.

1403
01:49:03,030 --> 01:49:04,780
Thank you, Logue.

1404
01:49:14,170 --> 01:49:15,670
Well done.

1405
01:49:16,960 --> 01:49:18,630
My friend.

1406
01:49:20,300 --> 01:49:22,050
Thank you...

1407
01:49:22,880 --> 01:49:24,300
...Your Majesty.

1408
01:49:27,100 --> 01:49:28,760
[Doors Open]

1409
01:49:36,730 --> 01:49:38,520
I knew you'd be good.

1410
01:49:47,530 --> 01:49:50,910
Thank you... Lionel.

1411
01:49:53,960 --> 01:49:55,420
Onwards.

1412
01:49:56,210 --> 01:49:59,550
- [Man #1] Congratulations, sir.<br/>- [Man #2] Well done, sir.

1413
01:49:59,630 --> 01:50:01,590
Couldn't have<br/>said it better myself, sir.

1414
01:50:01,670 --> 01:50:04,680
Your Majesty, I am speechless.

1415
01:50:04,760 --> 01:50:08,140
- Congratulations, sir.<br/>- Gentlemen.

1416
01:50:10,350 --> 01:50:14,850
- So how was Papa, Elizabeth?<br/>- Halting at first,

1417
01:50:14,940 --> 01:50:19,690
- But you got much better, Papa.<br/>- Well, bless you.

1418
01:50:20,570 --> 01:50:24,280
- And how about you, Margaret?<br/>- You were just splendid, Papa.

1419
01:50:24,360 --> 01:50:26,780
Of course I was.

1420
01:50:27,870 --> 01:50:29,950
Are we all ready?

1421
01:50:30,040 --> 01:50:31,540
[Elizabeth] Come on, girls.

1422
01:50:46,260 --> 01:50:49,600
