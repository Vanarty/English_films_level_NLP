Whoo-hoo!
Smash them in the head!

893
00:45:14,047 --> 00:45:15,048
Whoa!

894
00:45:20,804 --> 00:45:21,805
Watch out.

895
00:45:22,806 --> 00:45:23,807

Up high. Down low. Too slow.

898
00:45:42,075 --> 00:45:43,202
Outta my way, Bones!

899
00:45:45,621 --> 00:45:47,748
Ha! That didn't hurt.

900
00:45:47,915 --> 00:45:49,833
Ferdinand,
El Primero is watching.

901
00:45:49,917 --> 00:45:50,959
You gotta hit something.

902
00:45:51,126 --> 00:45:53,337
Nope. Actually, I'm gonna pass
on the violence.

903
00:45:53,504 --> 00:45:55,714
Well, if you don't hit them,
they're going to hit you.

904
00:45:55,881 --> 00:45:57,716

-Whoa!

You finally ready to fight?
Come on!

907
00:46:02,846 --> 00:46:04,056
Guapo with the hit.

908
00:46:04,223 --> 00:46:05,849
Take that, Valiente.

909
00:46:06,517 --> 00:46:08,936
You think you got
what it takes, Guapo?

910
00:46:09,019 --> 00:46:10,562
Then show that to El Primero.

911
00:46:10,729 --> 00:46:14,066
Oh, I will. I'll show him who
the real champ is around here.

912
00:46:16,944 --> 00:46:19,696
Keep it together, Guapo.

00:46:21,573 --> 00:46:22,658

915
00:46:23,617 --> 00:46:24,660
Aah!

916
00:46:25,285 --> 00:46:26,495
Hey! Get off me!

917
00:46:30,207 --> 00:46:31,208
EL PRIMERO: Enough.

918
00:46:31,375 --> 00:46:34,419
The bullfight is a battle
of wits and strength.

919
00:46:34,586 --> 00:46:36,505
These bulls have nothing.

920
00:46:36,672 --> 00:46:39,842

Give the bulls another chance.

921

If I do not find the best bull

923
00:46:44,388 --> 00:46:46,265
for the best bullfighter
by then...

924
00:46:46,431 --> 00:46:50,602
no bullfighter will ever
use your ranch again.

925
00:46:56,108 --> 00:46:58,735
What did you think you were
doing back there, you numpty?

926
00:46:58,902 --> 00:47:00,320
Are you trying
to make us look bad?

927
00:47:00,404 --> 00:47:01,780
Because you made us look bad.

928
00:47:01,947 --> 00:47:03,991
You made us look real bad.

929
00:47:04,157 --> 00:47:06,577
I was just trying
to help Guapo.

930
00:47:06,743 --> 00:47:08,871
Help? There's no helping.

00:47:10,205 --> 00:47:12,124
Oh, you are the worst
fighting bull

933
00:47:12,207 --> 00:47:13,750
I have ever partially seen.

934
00:47:13,917 --> 00:47:17,171
Well, that's because he isn't
a real fighter. (LAUGHS)

935
00:47:17,254 --> 00:47:20,632
Oh, little Ferdinand
had a growth spurt.

936
00:47:20,799 --> 00:47:23,844
But he's still the same scared
little coward he always was.

937
00:47:24,011 --> 00:47:26,555
Why does not wanting to fight
mean I'm scared?

938
00:47:26,722 --> 00:47:29,266
Yeah. That's ridonculous.
Look at him.

939
00:47:29,433 --> 00:47:31,268
My boy is a killing machine.
Right, Ferd?

940
00:47:31,435 --> 00:47:33,478
No, I'm not a killing machine.

941
00:47:33,562 --> 00:47:35,147
I've been trying
to tell you, Lupe.

942
00:47:35,314 --> 00:47:36,732
You didn't destroy a village?

943
00:47:36,899 --> 00:47:38,692
And I didn't eat a baby.

944
00:47:39,651 --> 00:47:41,153
Not even a nibble?

945
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:43,697
Eh...
Are you trying to tell me

946
00:47:43,780 --> 00:47:46,533
that you don't want to fight
for glory in the ring?

947
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:47,993
I'm not a fighter.

948
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:50,287
I don't understand that
at all.

949
00:47:50,454 --> 00:47:52,873

Look who got picked
by El Primero.

953
00:47:58,754 --> 00:48:00,130
Who's the bull now?

954
00:48:00,214 --> 00:48:03,675
Uh-huh. Guapo going to
the big show, that's right.

955
00:48:03,842 --> 00:48:04,843
What in the blazes?

956
00:48:05,010 --> 00:48:07,804
I have no idea
what happened back there.

957
00:48:07,888 --> 00:48:08,931
No clue.

is happening?

960
00:48:14,478 --> 00:48:15,687
Somebody narrate.

00:48:15,854 --> 00:48:19,024
I'm gonna be famous! Whoo!

00:48:19,191 --> 00:48:20,526
Oh, no!

963
00:48:20,692 --> 00:48:23,654
So long, suckers!

964
00:48:23,820 --> 00:48:26,615
Wait a second.
Where are they taking him?

965
00:48:26,949 --> 00:48:27,950
Uh...

966
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:31,286
They're taking Guap
to the chop house.

967
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:46,051
You.

968
00:48:46,218 --> 00:48:49,596
You messed with his head.
This is on you.

Oh, please.

970
00:48:51,390 --> 00:48:53,308
Guapo was never going
to make it to the ring.

971
00:48:53,392 --> 00:48:54,393
We all knew that.

972
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:57,145
And so, because of that,
he deserves to go there?

973

Listen to me, Flower Bull.

around here

or you're meat.

outta your head, man.

You won't tell anyone
about this, will you?

1002
00:50:51,802 --> 00:50:53,512
I won't say a word.

wanna talk about,
