I don't have a choice.
There's a tiger hunting me.

Really? Why a tiger?

587
00:41:45,421 --> 00:41:46,922

You know what his problem is?

594
00:42:04,690 --> 00:42:06,859
He always plays by the rules.

595
00:42:07,026 --> 00:42:08,986
And, sometimes rules
were meant to be...

well, not necessarily broken,
but certainly bent.

597
00:42:11,655 --> 00:42:14,033
And definitely reinterpreted.
Don't you think?

598
00:42:14,199 --> 00:42:16,785
He told me to go to the man village,
so, that's where I'm gonna go!

Okay, fine.
