MONEY IS BASICALLY JUST
AN ACCOUNTING SYSTEM.

WHO OWNS WHAT,

47
00:03:41,489 --> 00:03:43,824
WHO HAS WHAT,
WHO OWES WHAT TO WHOM.

48
00:03:43,857 --> 00:03:46,560
THAT IS ALL MONEY REALLY IS.

WOULD PERFORM.

VERY CLOSE TO HAPPENING.

THE CLOSEST WAS DIGICASH
FROM DAVID CHAUM.

[DAVID CHAUM]
PRIVACY OF PAYMENTS

140
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:45,065
IS ACTUALLY ESSENTIAL
FOR DEMOCRACY.

141
00:07:45,098 --> 00:07:47,968
THE REASON IS NOT
BECAUSE YOU NEED TO BE ABLE

142
00:07:48,001 --> 00:07:50,904
TO MAKE PRIVATE PAYMENTS
IN ORDER TO EXPRESS YOURSELF,

143
00:07:50,938 --> 00:07:54,608
BUT RATHER THAT IN ORDER
TO INFORM YOURSELF,

144
00:07:54,642 --> 00:07:56,877
YOU MAY NEED
TO PURCHASE INFORMATION

145
00:07:56,910 --> 00:08:01,715

THAT ALLOWS YOU TO HAVE
OPINIONS WORTH EXPRESSING.

KIND OF CAME UPON

151

AND THEY ONLY TOOK
THE WEAPONS.

152
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:19,600
THEY WERE MOST INTERESTED
IN THE ONES THAT COULD BE USED

153
00:08:19,633 --> 00:08:22,670
TO DISEMPOWER THE GOVERNMENT
AND EMPOWER INDIVIDUALS.

154
00:08:22,703 --> 00:08:24,738
[VIGNA]
THE BREAK BETWEEN HIM
AND THE CYPHERPUNKS CAME

155
00:08:24,772 --> 00:08:26,106
WHEN HE REALIZED
HE WOULD NEED

156
00:08:26,139 --> 00:08:28,041
EXISTING INSTITUTIONS
TO HELP HIM WITH IT,

157
00:08:28,075 --> 00:08:29,810
SO HE STARTED
TALKING TO GOVERNMENTS,

158
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:31,011
HE STARTED TALKING TO BANKS.

159
00:08:31,044 --> 00:08:32,580
HE WAS VERY CLOSE
TO HAVING

160
00:08:32,613 --> 00:08:34,181
THIS THING HAPPEN
IN THE LATE '90S,

161
00:08:34,214 --> 00:08:36,550
AND NOBODY WAS REALLY
PREPARED FOR THIS

162

AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN
IT CAME BACK TO LIFE

169
00:08:53,634 --> 00:08:55,703
AFTER THE FINANCIAL CRISIS,

170
00:08:55,736 --> 00:08:59,206
AND YOU HAD PEOPLE
GOING BACK TO THOSE EXPERIMENTS
IN THE 1990S

171
00:08:59,239 --> 00:09:02,075
AND LOOKING AT NEW WAYS OF
PUTTING THOSE IDEAS TOGETHER.

172
00:09:02,109 --> 00:09:05,879
NICK SZABO, IN 2006,
HAD JUST FINISHED UP

173
00:09:05,913 --> 00:09:09,149
A MID-LIFE STINT
AT LAW SCHOOL,

174
00:09:09,182 --> 00:09:12,920
AND IF YOU LOOK NICK'S WRITING
AROUND THE FINANCIAL CRISIS

175
00:09:12,953 --> 00:09:16,356
THAT IS REALLY REVIVED
HIS INTEREST

176
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:18,992
IN THESE IDEAS THAT,
YOU KNOW,

177
00:09:19,026 --> 00:09:20,894
HE HAD BEEN WORKING ON
IN THE 1990S

178
00:09:20,928 --> 00:09:24,865
WITH PRIVACY AND CONTRACTS
AND THE PROBLEMS

179
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:27,701
OF GOVERNMENTS
AND OTHER TRUSTED
THIRD PARTIES.

180
00:09:27,735 --> 00:09:31,872
AND HE BROUGHT BIT GOLD
BACK INTO THE CONVERSATION.

181
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:34,007
[VIGNA]
SO HAL FINNEY
CAME UP WITH HIS OWN SYSTEM.

182
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:37,044
ADAM BACK HAS HASHCASH,
WEI DAI HAS B MONEY,

183
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:38,879
SZABO HAS BIT GOLD.

184
00:09:41,148 --> 00:09:43,216
[WINTER]
SO WHAT SATOSHI DID
IN 2008,

185
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:46,920
WAS SATOSHI TOOK
A LOT OF THESE IDEAS
AND MADE THEM WORK.

186
00:09:46,954 --> 00:09:49,222
HE CREATED
AN ENCRYPTION-BASED
PROTOCOL--

187
00:09:49,256 --> 00:09:50,758
IT'S NOT REALLY
A CURRENCY--

188
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:53,226
UTILIZING A LEDGER
CALLED THE BLOCKCHAIN,

189
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:56,363
ALLOWING FOR MANY KINDS
OF TRANSACTIONS TO OCCUR.

190
00:09:56,396 --> 00:09:57,798
CONTRACTS,
ALL KINDS OF THINGS

191
00:09:57,831 --> 00:09:59,366
CAN BE BUILT
INTO THE BLOCKCHAIN.

192
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:03,837
AND IT DOES THIS
THROUGH A SYSTEM
OF CONSENSUS BUILDING

193
00:10:03,871 --> 00:10:07,941
WHERE MULTIPLE COMPUTERS
ALL PARTICIPATE

194
00:10:07,975 --> 00:10:10,911
IN THE MANAGEMENT
OF THE BLOCKCHAIN LEDGER,

195
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:12,946
A KIND OF DIGITAL DOCUMENT,
IF YOU WILL,

196
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,682
THAT KEEPS TRACK
OF ALL THE PAYMENTS.

197
00:10:25,859 --> 00:10:27,728
I UNDERSTAND
IT'S SOMETHING THAT

198
00:10:27,761 --> 00:10:30,764
IS INSTANTANEOUS ONLINE

199
00:10:30,798 --> 00:10:33,734
AND IT CAN GO
FROM ONE COUNTRY
TO THE OTHER

200
00:10:33,767 --> 00:10:35,803
AND YOU KNOW,
THEY CAN HAVE THEIR MONEY.

201
00:10:35,836 --> 00:10:39,039
WELL, I NEVER HEARD OF IT
UNTIL NANCY CALLED ME

202
00:10:39,072 --> 00:10:41,909
AND MENTIONED
DIGITAL CURRENCY

203
00:10:41,942 --> 00:10:44,044
AND I'M THINKING
SHE MUST HAVE BEEN

204
00:10:44,077 --> 00:10:45,813
IN THE BOTTLE THIS MORNING
OR SOMETHING.

205
00:10:45,846 --> 00:10:46,980
-[LAUGHTER]
-DIGITAL CURRENCY, OH.

206
00:10:47,014 --> 00:10:48,949
WHAT, WHAT?
YOU KNOW.

207
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:51,952
BUT THEY SAY
IT'S FOR PEOPLE WHO DON'T
HAVE BANK ACCOUNTS.

208
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:53,253
I CAN'T UNDERSTAND.

209
00:10:53,286 --> 00:10:54,354
IF YOU HAVE ONE COIN,
IT'S--

210
00:10:54,387 --> 00:10:57,424
LET'S SAY IT'S WORTH
$150.

211
00:10:57,457 --> 00:11:01,261
WHAT DO YOU DO,
GIVE THE NUMBER OR SOMETHING
TO THE--

212
00:11:01,294 --> 00:11:03,130
SAY, THE GROCERY
STORE PERSON,

213
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:04,965
AND THEN THEY SUBTRACT IT?

214
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:07,467
HOW DO YOU KNOW?
HOW DO YOU MAKE CHANGE?

215
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,137
HOW DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE
LEFT OR WHAT YOU'VE SPENT?

216
00:11:11,404 --> 00:11:13,807
[VIGNA]
YOU CAN HAVE
THE MONEY SUPPLY

217
00:11:13,841 --> 00:11:15,275
CONTROLLED BY A COMPUTER.

218
00:11:15,308 --> 00:11:16,944
THAT'S ALL BITCOIN
REALLY IS.

219
00:11:16,977 --> 00:11:18,812
THE KEY POINT HERE IS THAT

220
00:11:18,846 --> 00:11:20,714
THIS A DISTRIBUTED LEDGER.

221
00:11:20,748 --> 00:11:22,215
THERE IS NO CENTRAL SERVER.

222
00:11:22,249 --> 00:11:23,751
ALL THE OTHER LEDGERS
THAT WE HAVE,

223
00:11:23,784 --> 00:11:25,719
ALL THE BANKING LEDGERS,
ALL COMPANY LEDGERS,

224
00:11:25,753 --> 00:11:28,455
THEY ALL SIT AND RESIDE
INSIDE THAT COMPANY,

225
00:11:28,488 --> 00:11:30,323
WHICH MEANS THEY HAVE
ONE POINT OF ATTACK.

226
00:11:30,357 --> 00:11:32,993
THEY CAN BE HACKED.
JP MORGAN WAS HACKED

227
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:35,028
BY, YOU KNOW, THE CYBERTHIEVES
NOT SO LONG AGO.

228
00:11:35,062 --> 00:11:37,998
HOME DEPOT, TARGET,
WE'VE HAD ALL THESE COMPANIES
GET HACKED,

229
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:42,002
PRECISELY BECAUSE THERE'S
ONE CENTRAL REPOSITORY
OF INFORMATION.

230
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:45,138
THE BITCOIN LEDGER RESIDES,
ON, YOU KNOW,

231
00:11:45,172 --> 00:11:46,807
THOUSANDS OF COMPUTERS.

232
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,208
YOU CAN'T HACK THAT.

233
00:11:48,241 --> 00:11:50,110
EVERY SINGLE TRANSACTION
IS RECORDED,

234
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:51,879
AND ONCE IT IS RECORDED
IN THE BLOCKCHAIN,

235
00:11:51,912 --> 00:11:53,947
IT IS THERE,
IT IS PERMANENT.

236
00:11:53,981 --> 00:11:56,984
IT CANNOT BE ALTERED.
IT CANNOT BE CHANGED,
SO THAT YOU CAN READ IT.

237
00:11:57,017 --> 00:11:59,219
NOW THE IDENTITIES
OF THE PEOPLE ARE ENCRYPTED.

238
00:11:59,252 --> 00:12:00,821
THE WALLETS ARE ENCRYPTED,

239
00:12:00,854 --> 00:12:03,056
SO YOU DON'T KNOW WHO
IS SPENDING THE MONEY,

240
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:05,826
BUT YOU KNOW THAT EVERY
SINGLE BITCOIN OUT THERE

241
00:12:05,859 --> 00:12:07,861
HAS A HISTORY,
YOU KNOW WHERE IT'S BEEN,

242
00:12:07,895 --> 00:12:10,263
YOU KNOW THE DIFFERENT
ADDRESSES IT'S GONE BETWEEN.

243
00:12:12,933 --> 00:12:16,469
THE MOST IMPORTANT PIECES
OF THE BITCOIN INFRASTRUCTURE

244
00:12:16,503 --> 00:12:17,871
ARE THE MINERS.

245
00:12:17,905 --> 00:12:20,240
THESE ARE THE COMPUTERS
THAT ARE TASKED

246
00:12:20,273 --> 00:12:22,910
WITH MAINTAINING
THE LEDGER OF THE BLOCKCHAIN

247
00:12:22,943 --> 00:12:25,278
TO VERIFY THE INFORMATION,
TO UPDATE IT,

248
00:12:25,312 --> 00:12:27,447
TO MAKE SURE
THAT IT IS TRUSTWORTHY.

249
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,950
SO HOW DO WE
INCENTIVIZE THEM TO DO SO?

250
00:12:29,983 --> 00:12:34,254
AS THEY ARE GOING
THROUGH THE PROCESS OF
CONFIRMING TRANSACTIONS,

251
00:12:34,287 --> 00:12:37,390
THEY ARE SIMULTANEOUSLY
BEING SUBJECTED TO

252
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:40,260
A VERY, VERY DIFFICULT
COMPUTING TEST.

253
00:12:40,293 --> 00:12:43,797
THE BITCOIN CORE PROTOCOL
IS FORCING THEM

254
00:12:43,831 --> 00:12:46,166
TO LOOK FOR A NUMBER.

255
00:12:46,199 --> 00:12:48,268
ALL OF THESE MINERS
ARE ULTIMATELY COMPETING

256
00:12:48,301 --> 00:12:51,171
TO BE THE ONE THAT RECEIVES
THAT PAYOUT EVERY TEN MINUTES.

257
00:12:51,204 --> 00:12:53,206
BUT REALLY THAT'S
THE SECONDARY COMPONENT.

258
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,208
THEY'RE REALLY BEING
REWARDED WITH BITCOIN,

259
00:12:55,242 --> 00:12:56,576
BUT WHAT IS
THE MORE IMPORTANT TASK

260
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:58,478
IS THE VALIDATION
AND VERIFICATION

261
00:12:58,511 --> 00:13:01,882
OF TRANSACTIONS AND
THE MAINTAINING OF THE LEDGER.

262
00:13:01,915 --> 00:13:05,118
BITCOIN, IN BEING
THE FIRST TO ACHIEVE

263
00:13:05,152 --> 00:13:10,090
THIS HOLY GRAIL
OF DECENTRALIZED
VALUE EXCHANGE

264
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:12,459
THAT TRANSFERS
THAT PROCESS OF TRUST

265
00:13:12,492 --> 00:13:16,163
TO A COLLECTIVE AGREEMENT
AROUND A BODY

266
00:13:16,196 --> 00:13:18,265
OF INDEPENDENT COMPUTERS

267
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:21,068
WHO ARE COMPELLED
BY AN INCENTIVE SYSTEM

268
00:13:21,101 --> 00:13:22,435
TO MAINTAIN THAT CONSENSUS

269
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:25,105
AND AFFIRM THE INFORMATION
TO BE CORRECT

270
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:27,074
IS INCREDIBLY LIBERATING
BECAUSE IT MEANS

271
00:13:27,107 --> 00:13:28,942
THAT WE CAN DO IT WITHOUT
ALL THESE INTERMEDIARIES

272
00:13:28,976 --> 00:13:30,844
IN ALL
THESE DIFFERENT REALMS.

273
00:13:30,878 --> 00:13:33,881
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING BEHIND
BITCOIN IS NOT THE CURRENCY.

274
00:13:33,914 --> 00:13:36,516
THE KEY FACTOR
IS THE BLOCKCHAIN.

275
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:38,285
[TUCKER]
NOBODY EXPECTED THIS.

276
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:41,154
YOU KNOW, IN 2008,
VERY FEW PEOPLE CARED ABOUT IT.

277
00:13:41,188 --> 00:13:43,056
IT WAS JUST
THE COMPUTER SCIENTISTS

278
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:46,126
AND THE SORT OF CODE GEEKS
THAT WERE REALLY INTERESTED.

279
00:13:49,562 --> 00:13:51,064
ALL OF MY COMMUNICATION
WITH SATOSHI

280
00:13:51,098 --> 00:13:55,635
WAS EVER VIA EITHER
THE BITCOIN TALK FORUMS,

281
00:13:55,668 --> 00:14:00,073
WHICH, ALL OF
THAT COMMUNICATION IS...

282
00:14:00,107 --> 00:14:05,345
PUBLIC, OR PRIVATE FORUM
MESSAGES OR PRIVATE EMAILS.

283
00:14:05,378 --> 00:14:07,280
SATOSHI WAS ALWAYS
ALL BUSINESS.

284
00:14:07,314 --> 00:14:09,950
IT WAS JUST ALWAYS
ABOUT THE CODE.

285
00:14:09,983 --> 00:14:11,952
MY VERY MESSAGE
TO SATOSHI,

286
00:14:11,985 --> 00:14:15,889
I ASKED HIM, "SO,
IS SATOSHI YOUR REAL NAME?

287
00:14:15,923 --> 00:14:17,157
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE BEFORE?

288
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:18,525
CAN YOU TELL ME
A LITTLE BIT ABOUT YOURSELF?"

289
00:14:18,558 --> 00:14:20,627
AND HE JUST IGNORED
THAT COMPLETELY.

290
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,129
BUT CAME BACK AND SAID,
"YOU KNOW,

291
00:14:22,162 --> 00:14:23,530
GREAT TO HAVE MORE
EXPERIENCED PROGRAMMERS

292
00:14:23,563 --> 00:14:25,532
HELPING OUT
WITH THE PROJECT."

293
00:14:25,565 --> 00:14:27,935
YOU KNOW, "HERE'S
A COUPLE OF PROBLEMS
THAT NEED TO BE SOLVED.

294
00:14:27,968 --> 00:14:29,302
MAYBE YOU CAN
HELP SOLVE THEM."

295
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:39,246
[VOORHEES]
IN 2011,

296
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:41,949
I WAS INTO BITCOIN
SORT OF JUST AS A HOBBY.

297
00:14:41,982 --> 00:14:44,417
I DIDN'T REALLY KNOW
WHAT TO DO IN IT YET.

298
00:14:44,451 --> 00:14:46,419
I WAS TRYING TO MEET
EVERYONE I COULD,

299
00:14:46,453 --> 00:14:48,555
FIGURE OUT WHAT PROJECTS
WOULD BE COOL TO WORK ON.

300
00:14:48,588 --> 00:14:51,992
I MET ROGER VER SORT
OF IN AUGUST OF THAT YEAR

301
00:14:52,025 --> 00:14:54,427
AND A FEW MONTHS LATER,
HE RECOMMENDED TO THIS GUY,

302
00:14:54,461 --> 00:14:56,129
CHARLIE SHREM,
WHO STARTED BITINSTANT

303
00:14:56,163 --> 00:14:57,664
THAT THE CHARLIE
SHOULD HIRE ME

304
00:14:57,697 --> 00:15:00,200
AS THE HEAD OF MARKETING
FOR BITINSTANT.

305
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:02,002
[SHREM]
BITCOIN IS CASH
WITH WINGS.

306
00:15:02,035 --> 00:15:04,571
IT'S THE ABILITY TO BE ABLE
TO TAKE A LOCAL TRANSACTION

307
00:15:04,604 --> 00:15:06,974
AND DO IT GLOBALLY,
AND THAT'S WHY BITCOIN

308
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:08,641
IS GONNA OVERTURN
THE FINANCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE.

309
00:15:08,675 --> 00:15:10,510
BITCOIN IS LIKE
THE LARGEST

310
00:15:10,543 --> 00:15:13,713
SOCIOECONOMIC EXPERIMENT
THE WORLD HAS EVER SEEN.

311
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,715
[VOORHEES]
OUR CONVERSATIONS
WOULD RANGE FROM

312
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:18,185
YOU KNOW,
THE MUNDANE AND PRACTICAL,

313
00:15:18,218 --> 00:15:19,719
LIKE HOW THE HELL
ARE WE GONNA GET
ANOTHER BANK ACCOUNT

314
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:21,254
SINCE OUR CURRENT
BANK ACCOUNT'S

315
00:15:21,288 --> 00:15:22,555
PROBABLY GONNA GET
SHUT DOWN ANY DAY NOW?

316
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:25,325
TO VERY HIGH-MINDED,
ASPIRATIONAL ONES,

317
00:15:25,358 --> 00:15:27,995
LIKE, IS THIS ACTUALLY
GONNA CHANGE THE WORLD
IN A GOOD WAY?

318
00:15:28,028 --> 00:15:29,662
ARE WE JUST A BUNCH
OF CRAZY PEOPLE

319
00:15:29,696 --> 00:15:31,231
WHO DON'T KNOW WHAT
THE HELL WE'RE TALKING ABOUT,

320
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:33,700
OR ARE WE ACTUALLY
STARTING TO

321
00:15:33,733 --> 00:15:36,369
INITIATE AN INDUSTRY
WHICH, IN HINDSIGHT,

322
00:15:36,403 --> 00:15:37,637
WILL LOOK OBVIOUS
TO EVERYONE,

323
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:39,572
BUT, YOU KNOW,
RIGHT NOW DOES NOT?

324
00:15:41,508 --> 00:15:43,376
[CASEY]
CHARLIE SHREM WAS,
AT THAT STAGE,

325
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:46,113
A FAIRLY HIGH-PROFILE FIGURE
IN THE BITCOIN COMMUNITY.

326
00:15:46,146 --> 00:15:48,181
THE VICE CHAIRMAN
OF THE BITCOIN FOUNDATION

327
00:15:48,215 --> 00:15:51,451
AND YOU KNOW, ONE OF THESE
BITCOIN MILLIONAIRES

328
00:15:51,484 --> 00:15:53,453
WHO'D MADE A LOT OF MONEY
VERY QUICKLY.

329
00:15:53,486 --> 00:15:56,289
AND REALLY PLAYED
AN IMPORTANT ROLE
IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE

330
00:15:56,323 --> 00:15:59,159
OF MANAGING THE MOVEMENT
OF FUNDS AROUND THE SYSTEM

331
00:15:59,192 --> 00:16:01,361
IN THAT EARLY
RUDIMENTARY PHASE.

332
00:16:02,362 --> 00:16:04,131
[MAN]
632 BID!

333
00:16:04,164 --> 00:16:08,035
654 OFFER IN THE NEW YORK
CASH MARKET FOR BITCOIN.

334
00:16:08,068 --> 00:16:12,639
BUYERS RIGHT NOW
WILL PAY $632 CASH
ON THE SPOT.

335
00:16:15,575 --> 00:16:18,378
WHO'S NEXT FOR THE BITCOIN?
YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHAT BITCOIN IS?

336
00:16:22,449 --> 00:16:25,518
YOU KNOW WHAT I PREFER?
I PREFER DOLLARS.

337
00:16:36,763 --> 00:16:38,398
IF YOU WANT TO GO ON
DOWN TO 40 BROAD,

338
00:16:38,431 --> 00:16:41,301
RIGHT NEXT DOOR TO
THE STOCK EXCHANGE THERE,

339
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:43,703
TO THE NEW YORK
BITCOIN CENTER,

340
00:16:43,736 --> 00:16:46,139
YOU CAN BUY AND SELL
ALL THE TIME.

341
00:16:55,582 --> 00:16:58,085
- YOU HAVE A TABLE
IN THE MIDDLE.
- YEAH.

342
00:16:58,118 --> 00:17:00,620
JUST ONE SMALL TABLE,
ROUND.

343
00:17:00,653 --> 00:17:05,558
AND I HAVE FLOWERS,
LIKE A FLOWER ARRANGEMENT.

344
00:17:05,592 --> 00:17:07,827
- A VERY NICE
FLOWER ARRANGEMENT.
- BITCOIN FLOWERS?

345
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:10,163
BITCOIN FLOWERS.
BITCOIN FLOWERS WOULD BE

346
00:17:10,197 --> 00:17:13,133
WHITE LILY,
PURPLE AND ORANGE.

347
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:14,767
JUST RIGHT HERE,
THREE COLORS.

348
00:17:17,404 --> 00:17:21,241
WE'RE PUTTING TOGETHER
THE FIRST BITCOIN CENTER

349
00:17:21,274 --> 00:17:22,675
HERE IN NEW YORK CITY,

350
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:25,345
RIGHT NEXT DOOR TO
THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE

351
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:28,115
BITCOIN IS A NEW SPACE,

352
00:17:28,148 --> 00:17:32,385
AND MANY OF THE RULES
AND REGULATIONS HAVEN'T
BEEN IMPOSED YET.

353
00:17:32,419 --> 00:17:35,622
BUT WE WILL OPEN
ONE DAY SOON,

354
00:17:35,655 --> 00:17:39,526
AFTER THE LAWYERS
DO THEIR JOB,

355
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:43,496
A LIVE DIGITAL CURRENCY
EXCHANGE.

356
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:46,133
WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE
IS A FUSION BETWEEN

357
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:49,702
WALL STREET AND BITCOIN,
HOPEFULLY.

358
00:17:51,238 --> 00:17:53,773
[POPPER]
SATOSHI SEEMED
TO ACKNOWLEDGE

359
00:17:53,806 --> 00:17:57,610
THAT IT WOULD BE HARD
FOR BITCOIN TO DEVELOP
IN ANY WAY

360
00:17:57,644 --> 00:18:02,282
IN WHICH IT WASN'T INTERACTING
WITH THE REGULAR ECONOMY

361
00:18:02,315 --> 00:18:04,584
OF DOLLARS AND EUROS.

362
00:18:04,617 --> 00:18:06,519
THE PROBLEM
WITH EXCHANGES IS

363
00:18:06,553 --> 00:18:09,722
THAT THEY TOOK YOU BACK
TO THIS OLD WORLD

364
00:18:09,756 --> 00:18:12,425
THAT BITCOIN WAS REALLY
TRYING TO GET AWAY FROM.

365
00:18:12,459 --> 00:18:15,862
AS SOON AS YOU MOVE
BACK TO AN EXCHANGE,

366
00:18:15,895 --> 00:18:18,465
YOU'RE MOVING BACK
TO A WORLD

367
00:18:18,498 --> 00:18:23,436
IN WHICH SOME THIRD PARTY
HAS ALL THIS PERSONAL DATA
ON YOU,

368
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:24,737
HAS ALL OF YOUR MONEY,

369
00:18:24,771 --> 00:18:26,873
HAS ALL OF THE SECURITY
VULNERABILITIES,

370
00:18:26,906 --> 00:18:29,276
AND REALLY HAS NONE
OF THOSE STRENGTHS

371
00:18:29,309 --> 00:18:34,381
THAT BITCOIN
WAS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE.

372
00:18:34,414 --> 00:18:36,416
JED MCCALEB
CREATED MT. GOX,

373
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:38,318
ESSENTIALLY
ON A LARK ONE NIGHT

374
00:18:38,351 --> 00:18:42,455
BECAUSE HE COULDN'T
BUY BITCOINS AS QUICKLY
AS HE WANTED TO.

375
00:18:42,489 --> 00:18:44,857
[CASEY]
AND INTERESTINGLY,
HE DID IT BY STARTING

376
00:18:44,891 --> 00:18:47,494
WITH A URL
THAT HE'D PREVIOUSLY USED

377
00:18:47,527 --> 00:18:50,397
TO RUN MAGIC CARD
TRADING SITES.

378
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:53,266
SO YOU GET AN IDEA
ABOUT WHERE SOMEBODY'S IDEAS
ARE COMING FROM

379
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:56,369
AND HOW REALLY KIND OF
RUDIMENTARY SOME OF THEM WERE.

380
00:18:56,403 --> 00:18:59,539
[POPPER]
JED ESSENTIALLY THREW
THIS SITE TOGETHER,

381
00:18:59,572 --> 00:19:03,676
AND PUT IT ONLINE WITHOUT
TOO MUCH THOUGHT.

382
00:19:14,887 --> 00:19:18,725
JED ESSENTIALLY SOLD IT
TO THE FIRST PERSON HE FOUND.

383
00:19:18,758 --> 00:19:20,927
WHO WAS MARK KARPELES,
A FRENCH GUY

384
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,595
WHO WAS LIVING IN TOKYO.

385
00:19:22,629 --> 00:19:24,964
HE REALLY KNEW
VERY LITTLE ABOUT MARK

386
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:27,267
WHEN HE DECIDED
TO SELL IT TO HIM.

387
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:29,602
AND ONCE HE TOOK IT OVER,

388
00:19:29,636 --> 00:19:32,272
IT BEGAN GROWING
MUCH MORE QUICKLY

389
00:19:32,305 --> 00:19:35,808
THAN MARK WAS EXPECTING
OR WAS PREPARED FOR.

390
00:19:46,719 --> 00:19:48,488
[VIGNA]
THERE ARE 21 MILLION BITCOINS

391
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:50,357
PROGRAMMED INTO THE SYSTEM
THAT ARE GOING TO BE RELEASED.

392
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:52,292
IT'S A SET NUMBER,
BUT WITHIN THAT,

393
00:19:52,325 --> 00:19:54,627
EVERY SINGLE BITCOIN
CAN BE DIVIDED UP

394
00:19:54,661 --> 00:19:56,829
INTO A HUNDRED MILLION
DIFFERENT PIECES

395
00:19:56,863 --> 00:19:59,899
SO THERE'S ROOM FOR IT
TO EXPAND AS THE USE EXPANDS,

396
00:19:59,932 --> 00:20:03,370
ESPECIALLY IN
THE EMERGING MARKETS,
IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD.

397
00:20:03,403 --> 00:20:05,572
THAT IS REALLY
THE MOST INTERESTING PLACE

398
00:20:05,605 --> 00:20:07,907
TO SEE
WHERE THIS THING GOES.

399
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:10,910
SO IN MY POCKET I HAVE
A HUNDRED TRILLION
ZIMBABWE DOLLARS

400
00:20:10,943 --> 00:20:12,545
FROM THE RESERVE BANK
OF ZIMBABWE,

401
00:20:12,579 --> 00:20:14,514
JUST AS A REMINDER
OF WHAT HAPPENS

402
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:16,716
IF OUR GOVERNMENTS
SCREW UP OUR MONEY.

403
00:20:16,749 --> 00:20:18,951
YOU KNOW, ZIMBABWE'S
A GOOD EXAMPLE

404
00:20:18,985 --> 00:20:23,290
OF A GOVERNMENT THAT LOST
THE TRUST OF THEIR PEOPLE,

405
00:20:23,323 --> 00:20:24,557
AND THEY LOST
THE TRUST OF THEIR PEOPLE

406
00:20:24,591 --> 00:20:25,792
BY PRINTING TOO MUCH MONEY

407
00:20:25,825 --> 00:20:28,695
AND CAUSING RUNAWAY
HYPERINFLATION.

408
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:31,498
SO I THINK YOU WILL SEE PEOPLE
IN OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD

409
00:20:31,531 --> 00:20:33,300
WHO'VE EXPERIENCED
HYPERINFLATION

410
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:35,502
WHO'VE EXPERIENCED
BANK FAILURES.

411
00:20:35,535 --> 00:20:37,370
I THINK THOSE WILL BE
THE KIND OF PEOPLE

412
00:20:37,404 --> 00:20:41,541
WHO ARE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING--
SOMETHING NEW, RIGHT?

413
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:43,843
THEY'RE WILLING
TO TAKE THE RISK.

414
00:20:43,876 --> 00:20:46,946
A LOT OF US
TAKE THE CAPACITY
TO SEND MONEY TO OTHERS,

415
00:20:46,979 --> 00:20:48,515
RECEIVE MONEY,
STORE MONEY

416
00:20:48,548 --> 00:20:51,050
AND DO IT ELECTRONICALLY
THESE DAYS FOR GRANTED

417
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:54,387
BECAUSE WE ARE AMONGST
THE LUCKY 50% OR SO
OF THE WORLD

418
00:20:54,421 --> 00:20:55,822
THAT HAVE BANK ACCOUNTS.

419
00:20:55,855 --> 00:20:58,625
BUT 2.5 BILLION ADULTS
IN THE WORLD

420
00:20:58,658 --> 00:21:00,660
DO NOT HAVE ACCESS
TO BANK ACCOUNTS.

421
00:21:00,693 --> 00:21:03,062
A TECHNOLOGY LIKE BITCOIN,
CRYPTOCURRENCY,

422
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:08,401
HAS THE CAPACITY
TO BRING THOSE PEOPLE
INTO THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM,

423
00:21:08,435 --> 00:21:10,470
TO GIVE THEM THIS POWER
TO EFFECTIVELY HAVE

424
00:21:10,503 --> 00:21:12,839
WHAT YOU COULD ARGUE
IS A BANK IN THEIR CELL PHONE,

425
00:21:12,872 --> 00:21:14,507
A BANK IN THEIR POCKET.

426
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:18,811
REALLY COULD OPEN UP COMMERCE
TO A LOT OF PEOPLE

427
00:21:18,845 --> 00:21:21,614
WHO ARE CURRENTLY
EXCLUDED FROM IT.

428
00:21:21,648 --> 00:21:25,518
[ANDRESEN]
SOMEBODY WHO IS MAYBE
WORKING IN ONE COUNTRY

429
00:21:25,552 --> 00:21:28,488
AND, YOU KNOW, THEY WANT
TO SEND MONEY BACK HOME.

430
00:21:28,521 --> 00:21:31,724
AND RIGHT NOW,
LIKE, WESTERN UNION
IS A BIG WAY

431
00:21:31,758 --> 00:21:33,593
THAT PEOPLE DO REMITTANCES.

432
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:35,562
FROM A WESTERN UNION
PERSPECTIVE,

433
00:21:35,595 --> 00:21:38,365
WE SERVE CLIENTS IN MANY
DIFFERENT LOCATIONS
AROUND THE GLOBE,

434
00:21:38,398 --> 00:21:39,966
AND PRIMARILY
FOR REMITTANCES.

435
00:21:39,999 --> 00:21:43,002
WESTERN UNION
SERVES TYPICALLY
AN UNBANKED CUSTOMER,

436
00:21:43,035 --> 00:21:46,639
A CUSTOMER WHO IS
EITHER A MIGRANT WORKER,

437
00:21:46,673 --> 00:21:48,975
OR AN INDIVIDUAL WHO DOESN'T
FEEL COMFORTABLE

438
00:21:49,008 --> 00:21:50,677
IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES
SECTOR.

439
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:52,779
[ANDRESEN]
AND THE PROBLEM
WITH REMITTANCES

440
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:54,681
IS THEY'RE REALLY EXPENSIVE.

441
00:21:54,714 --> 00:21:57,450
SO IF I'M SENDING $100
BACK HOME,

442
00:21:57,484 --> 00:22:00,387
I MAY END UP SPENDING
$5.00 OR $10.00

443
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:05,057
JUST ON FEES
TO GET THAT MONEY
BACK TO MY FAMILY.

444
00:22:05,091 --> 00:22:07,927
THAT'S A HUGE PERCENTAGE
IF YOU'RE POOR AND WORKING.

445
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:11,130
SO SINCE BITCOIN
DOESN'T CARE ABOUT BORDERS,

446
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:13,500
I COULD JUST SEND BITCOIN
TO ANOTHER COUNTRY,

447
00:22:13,533 --> 00:22:15,802
AND IF MY FAMILY
IN THAT OTHER COUNTRY

448
00:22:15,835 --> 00:22:17,136
HAS SOME WAY OF SPENDING
THAT BITCOIN

449
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:18,771
OR HAS SOME WAY OF TRANS--

450
00:22:18,805 --> 00:22:21,874
OF EXCHANGING THAT BITCOIN
INTO THE LOCAL CURRENCY,

451
00:22:21,908 --> 00:22:26,479
THEN IT'S JUST
QUICKER AND CHEAPER
AND MORE CONVENIENT.

452
00:22:26,513 --> 00:22:28,515
AND A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK
THAT REMITTANCES

453
00:22:28,548 --> 00:22:31,418
WILL BE ONE OF THE REALLY BIG
FIRST USES FOR BITCOIN.

454
00:22:32,619 --> 00:22:35,522
THE ONE CHALLENGE THERE
IS WE DEAL WITH

455
00:22:35,555 --> 00:22:39,158
YOU KNOW, AT OUR COMPANY,
750 TRANSACTIONS, PEAK,
A SECOND.

456
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:41,127
AND THOSE HAPPEN INSTANTLY.

457
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:43,830
IF YOU LOOK AT A BLOCKCHAIN,
YOU HAVE TO WAIT
FOR VERIFICATIONS,

458
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:45,498
AND IF YOU DO
A RECENT TEST,

459
00:22:45,532 --> 00:22:47,667
IT TAKES ABOUT 15 MINUTES
FOR EVERY TRANSACTION

460
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,702
TO BE VALIDATED
BY THE NETWORK.

461
00:22:49,736 --> 00:22:51,170
THAT DOESN'T SCALE,

462
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:53,139
SO IT HAS
ITS CHALLENGES AS WELL.

463
00:23:00,813 --> 00:23:03,583
WIKILEAKS, WHICH SOLICITS
AND PUBLISHES

464
00:23:03,616 --> 00:23:05,418
SECRETS
AND SUPPRESSED MATERIAL

465
00:23:05,452 --> 00:23:07,520
FROM WHISTLEBLOWERS
AROUND THE WORLD,

466
00:23:07,554 --> 00:23:09,622
HAS BEEN UNDER CYBER ATTACK
FROM GOVERNMENTS

467
00:23:09,656 --> 00:23:10,990
THAT WANT TO SHUT IT DOWN.

468
00:23:11,023 --> 00:23:12,792
[NEWSCASTER]
PAYPAL IS THE LATEST BUSINESS

469
00:23:12,825 --> 00:23:14,627
TO BREAK TIES WITH WIKILEAKS,

470
00:23:14,661 --> 00:23:16,529
BUT THE WHISTLE-BLOWING
WEBSITE

471
00:23:16,563 --> 00:23:19,065
DEDICATED TO
PUBLISHING CLASSIFIED
GOVERNMENT DOCUMENTS

472
00:23:19,098 --> 00:23:20,900
STILL CONTINUES
TO SEEK FUNDING,

473
00:23:20,933 --> 00:23:24,437
WHILE CROSSING OUT PAYPAL
AS ONE METHOD OF PAYMENT.

474
00:23:24,471 --> 00:23:27,474
IN ORDER TO INSURE
OUR FUTURE SURVIVAL,

475
00:23:27,507 --> 00:23:30,910
WIKILEAKS IS NOW FORCED
TO TEMPORARILY SUSPEND

476
00:23:30,943 --> 00:23:33,179
ALL PUBLISHING OPERATIONS

477
00:23:33,212 --> 00:23:36,749
IN ORDER TO DIRECT
ALL OUR RESOURCES

478
00:23:36,783 --> 00:23:40,787
INTO FIGHTING THE BLOCKADE
AND RAISING FUNDS.

479
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:43,456
THE WIKILEAKS SCANDAL
SEEMED TO PROVIDE

480
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:45,024
AN OPPORTUNITY
FOR BITCOIN.

481
00:23:45,057 --> 00:23:47,860
AT THE TIME,
THE BIG BANKS AND CREDIT CARDS

482
00:23:47,894 --> 00:23:50,563
STOPPED PROCESSING PAYMENTS
FOR WIKILEAKS,

483
00:23:50,597 --> 00:23:53,733
AND SOME PEOPLE THOUGHT THAT
BITCOIN WOULD PROVIDE A WAY

484
00:23:53,766 --> 00:23:57,604
TO SEND DONATIONS
TO WIKILEAKS.

485
00:24:05,011 --> 00:24:09,248
YOU COULD CERTAINLY
SEE IN THE HUBBUB
AROUND WIKILEAKS

486
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:11,751
THAT SATOSHI
WAS STILL SOMEBODY

487
00:24:11,784 --> 00:24:14,921
WHO WAS VERY PARANOID
ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT,

488
00:24:14,954 --> 00:24:18,124
AND THE GOVERNMENT COMING IN
AND TAKING TOO CLOSE A LOOK

489
00:24:18,157 --> 00:24:19,592
AT THE BITCOIN PROJECT.

490
00:24:19,626 --> 00:24:21,260
AND YOU COULD ALSO SEE
THAT SATOSHI,

491
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:23,029
I THINK, REALIZED
AT THIS POINT

492
00:24:23,062 --> 00:24:27,033
THAT BITCOIN WAS STILL
YOUNG SOFTWARE

493
00:24:27,066 --> 00:24:29,736
AND THE KINKS HADN'T BEEN
WORKED OUT YET.

494
00:24:29,769 --> 00:24:32,004
[ANDRESEN]
IN, I THINK, LATE 2010,

495
00:24:32,038 --> 00:24:35,207
HE ASKED ME IF IT'D BE OKAY
IF HE PUT MY EMAIL ADDRESS

496
00:24:35,241 --> 00:24:37,043
ON THE BITCOIN.ORG
HOME PAGE,

497
00:24:37,076 --> 00:24:40,780
'CAUSE HE HAD BEEN
THE PRIMARY CONTACT
FOR PEOPLE.

498
00:24:40,813 --> 00:24:42,615
AND I SAID, "SURE."

499
00:24:42,649 --> 00:24:44,717
HE WENT AHEAD
AND CHANGED THE WEB PAGE,

500
00:24:44,751 --> 00:24:47,720
BUT WHAT HE DID IS
HE LEFT HIS NAME THERE,

501
00:24:47,754 --> 00:24:50,557
BUT HE TOOK AWAY
HIS EMAIL ADDRESS.

502
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:53,593
AND SO IT WAS JUST ME
AND MY EMAIL ADDRESS

503
00:24:53,626 --> 00:24:56,729
WHO WAS SUDDENLY GETTING
ALL OF THE ATTENTION.

504
00:24:56,763 --> 00:24:59,566
I THINK THAT WAS SATOSHI'S WAY
OF KIND OF SAYING,

505
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:01,868
"YOU'RE THE LEADER
OF THE PROJECT NOW."

506
00:25:01,901 --> 00:25:04,203
THERE WAS
ONE PARTICULAR EMAIL

507
00:25:04,236 --> 00:25:06,573
WHERE HE TOLD ME
THAT HE WAS GONNA STEP AWAY
FROM THE PROJECT

508
00:25:06,606 --> 00:25:08,975
AND DO SOMETHING ELSE.
HE NEVER TOLD ME WHAT ELSE

509
00:25:09,008 --> 00:25:11,811
HE'S GONNA DO
OR THAT HE IS DOING.

510
00:25:11,844 --> 00:25:16,015
I HAD JUST BEEN INVITED
TO GIVE A TALK AT THE CIA.

511
00:25:16,048 --> 00:25:17,850
AND I TOLD SATOSHI THAT
I ACCEPTED THE INVITATION

512
00:25:17,884 --> 00:25:20,252
TO GO SPEAK AT THE CIA.

513
00:25:20,286 --> 00:25:22,989
[POPPER]
AFTER HE SENT
THAT EMAIL TO SATOSHI

514
00:25:23,022 --> 00:25:25,792
TELLING HIM
THAT HE WAS PLANNING
ON GOING TO THE CIA,

515
00:25:25,825 --> 00:25:27,894
HE NEVER HEARD
FROM SATOSHI AGAIN,

516
00:25:27,927 --> 00:25:32,699
AND THAT WAS
ESSENTIALLY THE LAST TIME
ANYBODY HEARD FROM SATOSHI.

517
00:25:32,732 --> 00:25:35,167
[VIGNA]
YOU VERY QUICKLY GET CAUGHT UP
IN THE QUESTION

518
00:25:35,201 --> 00:25:37,269
OF WHO IS
SATOSHI NAKAMOTO?

519
00:25:37,303 --> 00:25:39,606
WHERE DID THIS COME FROM?
WHO IS THIS PERSON?

520
00:25:39,639 --> 00:25:41,007
I MEAN, THIS IS THE 2000S.

521
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,308
INFORMATION IS OUT THERE,
EVERYTHING.

522
00:25:42,341 --> 00:25:44,143
EVERYONE KNOWS EVERYTHING
ABOUT EVERYBODY.

523
00:25:44,176 --> 00:25:45,845
HOW CAN THERE POSSIBLY
BE A PERSON

524
00:25:45,878 --> 00:25:47,847
THAT NOBODY KNOWS
WHO THIS GUY IS?

525
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,983
BUT THERE IS A PERSON--
AT LEAST I THINK IT'S A PERSON.

526
00:25:51,017 --> 00:25:52,251
IT MIGHT BE A GROUP--

527
00:25:52,284 --> 00:25:53,886
WHO NOBODY KNOWS
WHO THIS GUY IS.

528
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:58,224
AND HE KIND OF APPEARS
OUT OF NOWHERE IN 2008

529
00:25:58,257 --> 00:26:00,292
ON THESE CRYPTOGRAPHY
EMAIL LISTS,

530
00:26:00,326 --> 00:26:02,228
WITH THIS SYSTEM
CALLED BITCOIN.

531
00:26:02,261 --> 00:26:04,196
HE'S VERY ACTIVE
IN THE EARLY YEARS,

532
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:05,632
THERE'S A LOT OF
BACK AND FORTH

533
00:26:05,665 --> 00:26:07,634
WITH HIM COMMUNICATING
WITH PEOPLE.

534
00:26:07,667 --> 00:26:10,136
[GREENBERG]
IT SEEMED LIKE MOST PEOPLE
KIND OF WROTE HIM OFF

535
00:26:10,169 --> 00:26:13,272
AS KIND OF LIKE
A DELUSIONS-OF-GRANDEUR
KIND OF SCHEME.

536
00:26:13,305 --> 00:26:15,074
HAL FINNEY,
ON THE OTHER HAND,

537
00:26:15,107 --> 00:26:18,310
SEEMED TO BE REALLY INTERESTED
RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING.

538
00:26:18,344 --> 00:26:20,112
HE WAS A CRYPTO-IDEALIST.

539
00:26:20,146 --> 00:26:22,682
LIKE, HE WAS NOT AS
KIND OF CYNICAL

540
00:26:22,715 --> 00:26:24,684
AS MANY OF
THE OTHER CYPHERPUNKS

541
00:26:24,717 --> 00:26:25,985
SO HE GOT REALLY
INTO THIS.

542
00:26:26,018 --> 00:26:27,920
HE STARTED TALKING
TO SATOSHI NAKAMOTO,

543
00:26:27,954 --> 00:26:32,959
WHO HE SAID SEEMED LIKE
SOME YOUNG JAPANESE
AMERICAN CODER.

544
00:26:32,992 --> 00:26:37,196
HAL FINNEY WAS THE FIRST GUY
TO WORK WITH NAKAMOTO.

545
00:26:37,229 --> 00:26:38,264
HE WAS A CRYPTOGRAPHER.

546
00:26:38,297 --> 00:26:39,899
SOON AS NAKAMOTO
RELEASED IT,

547
00:26:39,932 --> 00:26:41,901
HE WAS ONE OF THE FIRST PEOPLE
TO EMAIL HIM BACK AND SAY,

548
00:26:41,934 --> 00:26:43,903
"HEY, THIS IS INTERESTING.
I'D LIKE TO WORK WITH YOU."

549
00:26:43,936 --> 00:26:45,638
AND IN THE FIRST WEEKS
OF BITCOIN

550
00:26:45,672 --> 00:26:46,873
HE WORKED WITH HIM
BACK AND FORTH

551
00:26:46,906 --> 00:26:48,340
SETTING UP THE SYSTEM.

552
00:26:48,374 --> 00:26:51,177
AND SATOSHI NAKAMOTO
ENDED UP SENDING HAL FINNEY

553
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:54,280
THE FIRST EVER BITCOIN
TRANSACTION.

554
00:26:54,313 --> 00:26:57,183
[POPPER]
ANY DISCUSSION
OF SATOSHI'S IDENTITY

555
00:26:57,216 --> 00:27:00,219
HAS TO GO BACK TO THE FACT
THAT BITCOIN

556
00:27:00,252 --> 00:27:04,390
WAS BASED ON THIS
SMALL NUMBER OF PROJECTS
BACK IN THE 1990S

557
00:27:04,423 --> 00:27:07,326
THAT ONLY A HANDFUL
OF PEOPLE KNEW ABOUT,

558
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:10,663
LIKE HASHCASH
AND BIT GOLD AND B MONEY,

559
00:27:10,697 --> 00:27:15,101
AND SO YOU END UP WITH
A PRETTY SMALL GROUP OF PEOPLE

560
00:27:15,134 --> 00:27:19,238
WHO WOULD HAVE KNOWN
ABOUT THESE PROJECTS.

561
00:27:19,271 --> 00:27:21,340
[VIGNA]
PEOPLE THOUGH CHAUM,
DAVID CHAUM, WAS, YOU KNOW--

562
00:27:21,373 --> 00:27:22,975
EVERYBODY IN
THE CYPHERPUNK MOVEMENT

563
00:27:23,009 --> 00:27:24,176
AT ONE POINT OR ANOTHER,
THEY'VE SAID,

564
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:25,878
"WELL, HE MUST HAVE BEEN
SATOSHI."

565
00:27:25,912 --> 00:27:27,413
THEY'VE ALL COME OUT
AND DENIED IT.

566
00:27:27,446 --> 00:27:29,415
PROBABLY SOMEBODY
WHO STARTED OUT IN THE '90S,

567
00:27:29,448 --> 00:27:31,217
IN CALIFORNIA,
WITH THE CYPHERPUNKS.

568
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:34,253
SOMEBODY WHO WAS VERY,
VERY GOOD AT CRYPTOGRAPHY

569
00:27:34,286 --> 00:27:37,323
WHO UNDERSTANDS ENCRYPTION,
AND HAS DONE A WONDERFUL JOB

570
00:27:37,356 --> 00:27:42,094
OF JUST SEPARATING BITCOIN
FROM ANYTHING THAT CAN
IDENTIFY HIM.

571
00:27:43,429 --> 00:27:45,431
[POPPER]
I THINK FOR BITCOIN'S SAKE,

572
00:27:45,464 --> 00:27:48,367
THAT CONTINUING ANONYMITY
OF SATOSHI

573
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:51,270
HAS ENDED UP BEING
A REALLY GOOD THING,

574
00:27:51,303 --> 00:27:54,941
BECAUSE PEOPLE WHO
HAVE GOTTEN INVOLVED IN IT

575
00:27:54,974 --> 00:27:59,111
HAVE BEEN ABLE TO WRITE
THEIR OWN IDEAS AND DREAMS

576
00:27:59,145 --> 00:28:00,847
ONTO THIS TECHNOLOGY,

577
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,782
AND THERE WAS NOBODY
THERE TO SAY,

578
00:28:02,815 --> 00:28:04,784
"NO, THAT'S NOT
WHAT I MEANT."

579
00:28:04,817 --> 00:28:06,819
[SAXOPHONE PLAYING]

580
00:28:10,422 --> 00:28:11,958
IN THE EARLY, EARLY DAYS,

581
00:28:11,991 --> 00:28:14,026
THE FIRST GROUP WAS
REALLY JUST A BUNCH OF

582
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:17,864
MORE OR LESS
TECH-MINDED CODERS.

583
00:28:41,888 --> 00:28:43,289
[VIGNA]
THEN YOU HAD THE LIBERTARIANS
COME ON BOARD,

584
00:28:43,322 --> 00:28:45,057
WHO SAW IT THROUGH
A POLITICAL LENS,

585
00:28:45,091 --> 00:28:47,526
I'M EXCITED TO BE
A LITTLE BIT OF A PART OF IT

586
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:50,462
WITH ALLOWING
AND ACCEPTING BITCOIN.

587
00:28:50,496 --> 00:28:52,899
[VIGNA]
AND THEN YOU HAD THESE
TWO GROUPS WORKING TOGETHER

588
00:28:52,932 --> 00:28:54,400
AND THEY OVERLAPPED TOO,

589
00:28:54,433 --> 00:28:56,335
AND THE TIMING WAS VERY GOOD

590
00:28:56,368 --> 00:28:59,471
BECAUSE THE EXISTING SYSTEM
WAS IN UTTER DISREPAIR.

591
00:28:59,505 --> 00:29:01,841
IT WAS LIKE A MATCH
TO A PILE OF WOOD

592
00:29:01,874 --> 00:29:03,442
WITH GASOLINE
POURED ON TOP OF IT.

593
00:29:03,475 --> 00:29:06,846
AND THE WHOLE THING KIND OF
REALLY GOES VIRAL AND TAKES OFF,

594
00:29:06,879 --> 00:29:11,083
AND THEN YOU HAVE THE SUITS,
THE VC MONEY,

595
00:29:11,117 --> 00:29:12,484
AND IT WAS
VERY SMALL AT FIRST,

596
00:29:12,518 --> 00:29:14,453
JUST A COUPLE OF GUYS
OUT IN SILICON VALLEY

597
00:29:14,486 --> 00:29:18,090
WHO RAN INTO BITCOIN GUYS
AT COFFEE HOUSES

598
00:29:18,124 --> 00:29:20,426
AND YOU STARTED HAVING
THIS MESHING OF CONVERSATIONS.

599
00:29:20,459 --> 00:29:22,461
ONCE SILICON VALLEY
GETS ON BOARD,

600
00:29:22,494 --> 00:29:25,131
THAT WHOLE DYNAMIC
STARTS TO TAKE OFF.

601
00:29:25,164 --> 00:29:27,366
SO NOW YOU HAVE
THE TECH-MINDED CODERS,

602
00:29:27,399 --> 00:29:29,468
THE LIBERTARIANS,
THE COUNTER-CULTURE PEOPLE,

603
00:29:29,501 --> 00:29:31,003
THE VC, SILICON VALLEY,

604
00:29:31,037 --> 00:29:34,140
AND YOU HAVE THIS ENTIRE
GREAT MISHMASH OF PEOPLE

605
00:29:34,173 --> 00:29:35,407
COMING TOGETHER.

606
00:29:35,441 --> 00:29:37,076
YOU HAD A NETWORK EFFECT.

607
00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:38,477
THE MORE PEOPLE
THAT GOT INVOLVED,

608
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:40,479
THE STRONGER THE NETWORK GOT,

609
00:29:40,512 --> 00:29:43,415
AND THE MORE IT GREW
AND IT REALLY STARTED GROWING
ON ITSELF.

610
00:29:43,449 --> 00:29:46,585
AND IN 2013 ESPECIALLY,

611
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:49,889
YOU LITERALLY SEE
THIS THING MUSHROOM.

612
00:29:49,922 --> 00:29:52,925
THE THING WAS JUST GROWING,
GROWING AND GROWING
AND GROWING

613
00:29:52,959 --> 00:29:55,294
AS MORE AND MORE PEOPLE
GOT INVOLVED.

614
00:29:58,464 --> 00:30:02,101
I THINK MOST BITCOIN
COMPANIES AT THE TIME

615
00:30:02,134 --> 00:30:06,272
KNEW THAT A BIG PART
OF THE MARKET FOR BITCOINS

616
00:30:06,305 --> 00:30:09,241
WAS PEOPLE BUYING DRUGS
ON SILK ROAD

617
00:30:09,275 --> 00:30:11,077
WHO NEEDED BITCOINS
TO DO THAT.

618
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:12,945
THE BIG BANG MOMENT
FOR BITCOIN

619
00:30:12,979 --> 00:30:14,413
WAS THE SILK ROAD.

620
00:30:14,446 --> 00:30:17,884
WHAT ROSS ULBRICHT DID
BY CREATING THE SILK ROAD

621
00:30:17,917 --> 00:30:21,220
WAS HE TOOK THIS
BY NO MEANS COMMON

622
00:30:21,253 --> 00:30:23,422
BUT USABLE CRYPTOCURRENCY
CALLED BITCOIN

623
00:30:23,455 --> 00:30:25,557
AND HE MARRIED IT
WITH A STREAMLINED,

624
00:30:25,591 --> 00:30:27,426
WORKABLE USER INTERFACE

625
00:30:27,459 --> 00:30:30,863
THAT WAS A FREE MARKET
THAT COULD SELL ANYTHING.

626
00:30:32,464 --> 00:30:35,367
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN
IF PEOPLE WERE REALLY FREE

627
00:30:35,401 --> 00:30:38,170
TRULY FREE TO TRADE
WHAT THEY WANTED TO?

628
00:30:38,204 --> 00:30:42,174
[WINTER]
ROSS DID HAVE
AN EXTREMELY RADICAL

629
00:30:42,208 --> 00:30:44,576
LIBERTARIAN VIEWPOINT,

630
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:48,180
AND REALLY WANTED TO EXPERIMENT
WITH USING TECHNOLOGY

631
00:30:48,214 --> 00:30:51,317
TO CREATE FREE MARKETS
FOR PEOPLE.

632
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:54,921
WHAT ROSS ULBRICHT
DID IS A COMBINATION
OF TOR AND BITCOIN.

633
00:30:54,954 --> 00:30:57,223
THAT WAS THE "AHA" MOMENT
THAT ROSS MUST HAVE HAD.

634
00:30:57,256 --> 00:31:00,659
[GREENBERG]
THE SILK ROAD WAS
BASICALLY THE FRUITION

635
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:05,965
OF ALL THE CYPHERPUNK DREAMS,
THE CRYPTO-ANARCHISTS'
UTOPIA

636
00:31:05,998 --> 00:31:07,900
THAT THEY HAD IMAGINED
IN THE '90S,

637
00:31:07,934 --> 00:31:09,435
YOU KNOW, WAS REAL NOW.

638
00:31:09,468 --> 00:31:14,406
THIS WAS A PERFECTLY,
IN THEORY, ANONYMOUS WEBSITE,

639
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:16,642
WITH PERFECTLY, IN THEORY,
ANONYMOUS MONEY

640
00:31:16,675 --> 00:31:19,278
USED TO BY ANY CONTRABANDS
IMAGINABLE.

641
00:31:19,311 --> 00:31:23,149
THE SILK ROAD WEBSITE
IS A PARTICULAR HEADACHE
FOR AUTHORITIES.

642
00:31:23,182 --> 00:31:25,617
IT'S A ANONYMOUS
ONLINE MARKETPLACE

643
00:31:25,651 --> 00:31:28,520
WHERE PEOPLE SELL DRUGS
THAT ARE POSTED TO CUSTOMERS

644
00:31:28,554 --> 00:31:31,190
ALL OVER THE WORLD.

645
00:31:31,223 --> 00:31:33,359
[CHRIS TARBELL]
CYBER INVESTIGATORS, YOU KNOW,
WHEN THERE'S A CRIME

646
00:31:33,392 --> 00:31:36,162
CAN KIND OF TRACE YOU BACK
BECAUSE YOU HAVE AN IP ADDRESS.

647
00:31:36,195 --> 00:31:37,263
IT'S LIKE
A TELEPHONE NUMBER,

648
00:31:37,296 --> 00:31:38,965
SO IF YOU CALL
ANOTHER COMPUTER

649
00:31:38,998 --> 00:31:41,200
THAT IP ADDRESS IS TRACKED.

650
00:31:41,233 --> 00:31:43,469
ON TOR, THAT'S TAKEN AWAY,
BECAUSE YOUR INFORMATION

651
00:31:43,502 --> 00:31:45,437
HOPS FROM COMPUTER
TO COMPUTER TO COMPUTER

652
00:31:45,471 --> 00:31:47,506
SO THERE'S NO WAY
TO TRACE YOU BACK
TO YOUR ORIGINAL ONE.

653
00:31:47,539 --> 00:31:52,144
TOR IS AN ANONYMOUS SYSTEM,

654
00:31:52,178 --> 00:31:54,213
SO IF YOU USE
THE TOR BROWSER,

655
00:31:54,246 --> 00:31:55,647
WHICH IT HAS A BROWSER.

656
00:31:55,681 --> 00:31:57,449
YOU CAN GO TO TOR
AND DOWNLOAD THEIR BROWSER,

657
00:31:57,483 --> 00:32:01,087
YOU CAN BROWSE WITH
SOME DEGREE OF SECURITY.

658
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:04,090
SO THAT'S GREAT FOR PLUGGING
YOUR BANKING INFORMATION

659
00:32:04,123 --> 00:32:05,557
INTO A SITE
SO YOU DON'T GET HACKED.

660
00:32:05,591 --> 00:32:08,694

WHICH HAS SIMILAR USES,

661
00:32:08,727 --> 00:32:10,396
IS CALLED
TOR HIDDEN SERVICES.

662
00:32:10,429 --> 00:32:14,200
TOR HIDDEN SERVICES
IS ACTUALLY, TO PUT IT SIMPLY,

663
00:32:14,233 --> 00:32:16,235
A URL THAT DOESN'T HAVE ".COM"
ON THE END OF IT.

664
00:32:16,268 --> 00:32:17,569
IT HAS ".ONION."

665
00:32:17,603 --> 00:32:19,438
AND THAT IS
ITS OWN LITTLE SPACE

666
00:32:19,471 --> 00:32:24,010
WHERE YOU CAN CREATE WEBSITES
AND YOU COULD FREELY TRANSACT

667
00:32:24,043 --> 00:32:26,645
WITHOUT OVERSIGHT
OR REGULATION.

668
00:32:26,678 --> 00:32:28,680
[TARBELL]
PEOPLE PUT WEBSITES ON THERE

669
00:32:28,714 --> 00:32:31,183
THAT ARE OUTSIDE OF
LAW ENFORCEMENT'S VIEW.

670
00:32:31,217 --> 00:32:33,119
THERE'S HACKERS FOR HIRE,
THERE'S MALWARE,

671
00:32:33,152 --> 00:32:35,154
THERE'S CREDIT CARD
DUMP SERVICES

672
00:32:35,187 --> 00:32:36,588
THERE'S A WHOLE BUNCH OF THEM.

673
00:32:36,622 --> 00:32:39,625
CHRIS TARBELL HAS ENDED UP
BEING, IN SOME WAYS,

674
00:32:39,658 --> 00:32:43,562
THE MOST IMPORTANT
FBI DIGITAL CRIME INVESTIGATOR

675
00:32:43,595 --> 00:32:45,231
OF THE LAST FEW YEARS.

676
00:32:45,264 --> 00:32:48,067
HE WAS THE ONE WHO TOOK
DOWN ANONYMOUS, ESSENTIALLY.

677
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:51,203
SO WE DECIDED
TO START LOOKING AT SOME
OF THE SERVICES ON TOR,

678
00:32:51,237 --> 00:32:52,504
AND SILK ROAD
BEING ONE THEM,

679
00:32:52,538 --> 00:32:54,206
OTHER CASES,
THEY WOULD HIT TOR,

680
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,008
AND THEY WOULD KIND OF THROW
THEIR HANDS IN THE AIR

681
00:32:56,042 --> 00:32:58,610
AND SAY "IT'S TOR, THERE'S NOT
MUCH WE CAN DO ABOUT IT."

682
00:32:58,644 --> 00:33:02,114
I FOUND IT INTERESTING
TO KIND OF TAKE A LOOK AT IT
AND TACKLE IT.

683
00:33:07,619 --> 00:33:09,155
[VOORHEES]
BITINSTANT WAS BASICALLY BORN

684
00:33:09,188 --> 00:33:10,789
BECAUSE IF YOU WANTED
TO MOVE YOUR DOLLARS

685
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:12,158
INTO A BITCOIN EXCHANGE,

686
00:33:12,191 --> 00:33:13,725
IT TAKES AT LEAST
THREE DAYS.

687
00:33:13,759 --> 00:33:16,728
AND SINCE THE MAJOR EXCHANGE,
MT. GOX, WAS IN TOKYO

688
00:33:16,762 --> 00:33:18,530
IT COULD TAKE
A WEEK OR MORE.

689
00:33:18,564 --> 00:33:20,632
SO THAT'S REALLY
PROBLEMATIC,

690
00:33:20,666 --> 00:33:23,235
AND BASICALLY
CHARLIE FIGURED OUT THAT

691
00:33:23,269 --> 00:33:27,339
IF YOU JUST HELD A BALANCE
OF DOLLARS AT THE EXCHANGE,

692
00:33:27,373 --> 00:33:30,109
YOU COULD GO TO HIM AND SAY,
"CHARLIE, I'LL GIVE YOU $100.

693
00:33:30,142 --> 00:33:33,145
WILL YOU GIVE ME $100
OF CREDIT AT THE EXCHANGE?"

694
00:33:33,179 --> 00:33:35,481
AND YOU CAN LITERALLY
THEN HAVE YOUR DOLLARS
AT THE EXCHANGE

695
00:33:35,514 --> 00:33:38,450
IN TEN SECONDS
AS OPPOSED TO A WEEK.

696
00:33:38,484 --> 00:33:41,320
SO THAT'S HUGELY HELPFUL,
ESPECIALLY WHEN BITCOIN
IS SO VOLATILE

697
00:33:41,353 --> 00:33:43,389
AND YOU NEED
TO KNOW EXACTLY WHAT PRICE
YOU'RE GOING TO GET.

698
00:33:43,422 --> 00:33:45,057
CHARLIE WAS RAISING CAPITAL

699
00:33:45,091 --> 00:33:47,126
RIGHT AS, SORT OF,
I JOINED.

700
00:33:47,159 --> 00:33:49,661
DURING THAT PROCESS,
HE CAME ACROSS LOTS OF

701
00:33:49,695 --> 00:33:52,364
INTERESTED INVESTORS WHO WERE
STARTING TO GET A WHIFF

702
00:33:52,398 --> 00:33:56,168
THAT MAYBE THIS
BITCOIN THING WAS COOL.

703
00:33:56,202 --> 00:33:58,070
[CAMERON WINKLEVOSS]
WE HAD AN INTERESTING
DEBATE EARLY ON

704
00:33:58,104 --> 00:34:01,440
ABOUT DO WE INVEST IN BITCOIN
OR BITCOIN COMPANIES

705
00:34:01,473 --> 00:34:04,276
AND WE SORT OF
DECIDED TO DO BOTH.

706
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:07,113
MORE TOWARDS INVESTING
IN ACTUALLY BITCOIN

707
00:34:07,146 --> 00:34:08,580
IN THE ASSET EARLY DAYS,

708
00:34:08,614 --> 00:34:11,517
BUT ALSO TRYING TO PLACE
A FEW BETS IN THE ECOSYSTEM

709
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:15,187
TO SUPPORT THE COMPANIES,
SUPPORT THE ENTREPRENEURS,

710
00:34:15,221 --> 00:34:17,456
AND SEE HOW THAT WENT.

711
00:34:17,489 --> 00:34:21,127
A FEW DAYS AFTER THEY FIRST
FOUND OUT ABOUT BITCOIN,

712
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:24,563
THEY WERE IN THE BITINSTANT
OFFICES IN NEW YORK

713
00:34:24,596 --> 00:34:26,598
MEETING WITH
ERIK AND CHARLIE.

714
00:34:26,632 --> 00:34:31,870
AND ERIK AND CHARLIE
ESSENTIALLY TALKED THEM
THROUGH BITCOIN

715
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:35,574
AND ANSWERED ALL OF THEIR
QUESTIONS AND CONCERNS.

716
00:34:35,607 --> 00:34:38,277
WHAT MADE YOU INVEST
IN BITINSTANT?

717
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:41,647
THERE ARE A LOT OF COMPANIES
AND EXCHANGES AND WEBSITES.

718
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:45,351
WITH RESPECT TO BITCOIN,
REGULATION IS OBVIOUSLY
A BIG QUESTION.

719
00:34:45,384 --> 00:34:48,420
WHAT YOU DO WANT IS
A COMPANY THAT SORT OF TAKES
THAT SERIOUSLY

720
00:34:48,454 --> 00:34:50,889
AND UNDERSTANDS THAT
THERE'S THE TECHNOLOGY ELEMENT,

721
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:52,458
THERE'S BUILDING THE COMPANY,

722
00:34:52,491 --> 00:34:53,525
AND THEN THERE'S ALSO
CREATING THE COMPANY

723
00:34:53,559 --> 00:34:54,826
THAT WORKS WITH REGULATORS.

724
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:56,562
AND SO THAT'S BITINSTANT.

725
00:34:56,595 --> 00:34:58,830
IT'S NOT THIS SORT OF
COMPLETELY UNDERGROUND THING?

726
00:34:58,864 --> 00:35:02,334
YEAH, CHARLIE THE CEO
HAPPENS TO HAVE BEEN IN
THIS SPACE FOR A LONG TIME,

727
00:35:02,368 --> 00:35:04,836
SO HE'S SORT OF ON
THE PULSE AND THE CUTTING EDGE.

728
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:06,505
[SHREM]
YOU KNOW, YOU COME OUT
AND YOU SAY, LIKE,

729
00:35:06,538 --> 00:35:08,374
"WE WANT THIS BITCOIN THING
TO OVERTURN EVERYTHING,"

730
00:35:08,407 --> 00:35:10,442
BUT AT THE SAME TIME
WE HAVE TO BE COMPLIANT

731
00:35:10,476 --> 00:35:12,244
AND YOU HAVE TO KNOW
YOUR CUSTOMER.

732
00:35:12,278 --> 00:35:14,913
YOU HAVE TO KNOW
EVERY SINGLE CUSTOMER
NO MATTER WHAT.

733
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:17,316
EVEN IF THEY'RE TRANSFERRING
A DOLLAR OR $1,000.

734
00:35:17,349 --> 00:35:18,817
AND HOW REASONABLE IS THAT?

735
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:20,786
THE TERM "MONEY LAUNDERING"
WAS INVENTED BY BANKS,

736
00:35:20,819 --> 00:35:22,588
AND KNOWING YOUR CUSTOMER
SHOULDN'T BE

737
00:35:22,621 --> 00:35:24,723
THIS COMPLICATED,
EXPENSIVE THING.

738
00:35:24,756 --> 00:35:27,826
AND YOU SHOULDN'T
TREAT EVERYONE LIKE
A CRIMINAL IN THE BEGINNING.

739
00:35:27,859 --> 00:35:29,795
[TYLER WINKLEVOSS]
THEY REALLY WANTED US INVOLVED.

740
00:35:29,828 --> 00:35:32,564
PEOPLE WERE REALLY FRIENDLY,
BECAUSE IT BENEFITS YOU

741
00:35:32,598 --> 00:35:34,666
TO ONBOARD MORE PEOPLE IN,

742
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:37,869
SO BITCOIN'S ALWAYS BEEN
THIS VERY FRIENDLY COMMUNITY

743
00:35:37,903 --> 00:35:41,407
AND IT'S ALSO-- IN SOME WAYS
IT'S SELF-SERVING THAT WAY,

744
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:45,177
BUT WE WERE THERE
FOR THE RIGHT REASONS.

745
00:35:45,211 --> 00:35:48,447
[POPPER]
AT THE TIME, BITINSTANT
WAS THE BIG COMPANY

746
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,781
OTHER THAN MT. GOX.

747
00:35:49,815 --> 00:35:53,452
IT WAS THE WAY THAT MOST
AMERICANS WERE ABLE

748
00:35:53,485 --> 00:35:55,421
TO BUY BITCOINS.

749
00:35:55,454 --> 00:35:57,556
HERE IT IS.

750
00:35:57,589 --> 00:36:00,226
SO BITINSTANT
WAS LOCATED RIGHT THERE.

751
00:36:00,259 --> 00:36:02,761
I THINK IT'S THE ONE
THAT NOW SAYS "BLING."

752
00:36:02,794 --> 00:36:04,863
IT WAS A WHIRLWIND
SIX MONTHS.

753
00:36:04,896 --> 00:36:07,699
GOING FROM TOTAL OBSCURITY
WITH NO MONEY

754
00:36:07,733 --> 00:36:11,670
TO BECOMING ONE OF
THE HOT STARTUPS OF BITCOIN.

755
00:36:11,703 --> 00:36:15,641
BUT ALMOST AS SOON AS
THE TWINS MADE THEIR INVESTMENT
IN THE COMPANY,

756
00:36:15,674 --> 00:36:17,243
IT BEGAN FALLING APART.

757
00:36:17,276 --> 00:36:19,511
THE TWINS HAD A MUCH MORE
PRACTICAL APPROACH

758
00:36:19,545 --> 00:36:21,347
TO BITCOIN
AND BITINSTANT.

759
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:24,316
THEY WANTED TO SEE
THE COMPANY MAKING MONEY

760
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:26,318
AND MAKING AS MUCH MONEY
AS IT COULD

761
00:36:26,352 --> 00:36:27,753
AS QUICKLY AS IT COULD.

762
00:36:27,786 --> 00:36:30,622
THEY SAW EARLY ON
THAT IT WOULD BE REGULATED,

763
00:36:30,656 --> 00:36:32,258
THAT IT WASN'T
GONNA BE THIS BIG,

764
00:36:32,291 --> 00:36:34,793
AND HAVE NO ONE BE
INTERESTED IN REGULATING IT.

765
00:36:34,826 --> 00:36:37,629
SO THEY FEARED THAT
ALL KINDS OF REGULATORS

766
00:36:37,663 --> 00:36:39,731
WOULD COME IN
AT ALL DIFFERENT ANGLES

767
00:36:39,765 --> 00:36:41,600
AND TIE THE THING UP
IN A COMPLETE MORASS

768
00:36:41,633 --> 00:36:43,235
WHERE NOTHING
WOULD EVER GET DONE.

769
00:36:43,269 --> 00:36:46,638
SO THEY WANTED TO HELP
DRIVE THE REGULATION

770
00:36:46,672 --> 00:36:49,375
SO THAT WHATEVER REGULATION
WOULD BE THERE WOULD WORK

771
00:36:49,408 --> 00:36:53,379
AND WOULD NOT END UP
BEING A COMPLETE DEAD END
FOR BITCOIN.

772
00:36:54,646 --> 00:36:56,982
[VOORHEES]
THAT STRATEGY IS SMARTER,

773
00:36:57,015 --> 00:36:58,950
FROM PURELY
A BUSINESS PERSPECTIVE,

774
00:36:58,984 --> 00:37:01,620
BUT I'M NOT IN THIS PURELY
FROM A BUSINESS PERSPECTIVE.

775
00:37:01,653 --> 00:37:04,390
I AM IN THIS FOR BUSINESS
AND BECAUSE I'M TRYING

776
00:37:04,423 --> 00:37:05,791
TO CHANGE THE WORLD
AND MAKE IT BETTER,

777
00:37:05,824 --> 00:37:07,859
AND BUILDING
BITCOIN COMPANIES

778
00:37:07,893 --> 00:37:09,428
AND BEGGING FOR REGULATION

779
00:37:09,461 --> 00:37:11,263
THAT MATCHES EXACTLY
THE BANKING REGULATION

780
00:37:11,297 --> 00:37:12,731
THAT HAS CAUSED
SO MANY PROBLEMS

781
00:37:12,764 --> 00:37:14,766
I FEEL LIKE IS
COUNTERPRODUCTIVE.

782
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:19,605
FOR THE MOST PART,
BITINSTANT WAS ACTUALLY
TAKING STEPS

783
00:37:19,638 --> 00:37:24,910
TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE
WEREN'T USING THE SERVICE
FOR ILLEGAL PURPOSES,

784
00:37:24,943 --> 00:37:28,514
BUT CHARLIE MADE THE MISTAKE
IN DEALING WITH BTCKING

785
00:37:28,547 --> 00:37:30,849
OF ACKNOWLEDGING
THAT HE KNEW

786
00:37:30,882 --> 00:37:33,051
WHAT BTCKING WAS DOING,

787
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:35,954
AND THAT HE WAS ACQUIRING
BITCOINS TO SELL THEM

788
00:37:35,987 --> 00:37:37,623
TO SILK ROAD CUSTOMERS.

789
00:37:39,958 --> 00:37:42,994
IN THIS CASE,
CHARLIE WORKED WITH THE GUY

790
00:37:43,028 --> 00:37:46,332
AND WROTE EMAILS THAT
ESSENTIALLY ACKNOWLEDGED

791
00:37:46,365 --> 00:37:48,967
HE KNEW WHAT
THIS GUY WAS UP TO.

792
00:38:10,422 --> 00:38:11,890
THAT STUNNING ARREST
OF THE DRUG KINGPIN

793
00:38:11,923 --> 00:38:13,925
WHO GOES BY THE NAME
"DREAD PIRATE ROBERTS"

794
00:38:13,959 --> 00:38:16,462
AND APPEARS TO HAVE CORNERED
THE INTERNET DRUG MARKET.

795
00:38:16,495 --> 00:38:19,097
HIS REAL NAME IS ROSS ULBRICHT
AND HIS WEBSITE, SILK ROAD,

796
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:21,933
IS PACKED WITH PRODUCTS
LIKE COCAINE AND HEROIN.

797
00:38:21,967 --> 00:38:23,902
[NEWSCASTER]
THE PAYMENT SYSTEM
IS ALL THROUGH BITCOINS,

798
00:38:23,935 --> 00:38:26,438
WHICH IS BASICALLY
DIGITAL CURRENCY,

799
00:38:26,472 --> 00:38:28,740
NOT BACKED UP BY
ANY INTERNATIONAL BANKS,

800
00:38:28,774 --> 00:38:30,509
NOT BACKED UP
BY ANY US BANKS,

801
00:38:30,542 --> 00:38:33,078
BUT SIMPLY BASED ON
THE CONFIDENCE OF THE USERS

802
00:38:33,111 --> 00:38:35,614
WHO EXCHANGE THESE BITCOINS
COMPUTER TO COMPUTER.

803
00:38:40,552 --> 00:38:42,554
[WINTER]
THERE'S A REASON WHY
THE CASE WAS TRIED IN NEW YORK,

804
00:38:42,588 --> 00:38:43,855
IN THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT,

805
00:38:43,889 --> 00:38:47,959
AND LARGELY THAT
WAS BECAUSE OF BITCOIN.

806
00:38:47,993 --> 00:38:50,095
ROSS WAS CAUGHT
IN SAN FRANCISCO.

807
00:38:50,128 --> 00:38:53,599
THE SILK ROAD SERVERS
WERE OUT OF THE COUNTRY.

808
00:38:53,632 --> 00:38:56,802
SO WHY WAS ROSS'S CASE
TRIED IN THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT
OF NEW YORK

809
00:38:56,835 --> 00:39:00,839
WHERE MOST OF THE FINANCIAL
REGULATIONS CASES
ARE DEALT WITH?

810
00:39:00,872 --> 00:39:03,074
WHERE THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY,
PREET BHARARA

811
00:39:03,108 --> 00:39:05,010
HAS BEEN ALL OVER BITCOIN.

812
00:39:05,043 --> 00:39:07,579
WHERE CHARLES SCHUMER,
THE SENATOR, HAS BEEN ALL OVER
BITCOIN.

813
00:39:07,613 --> 00:39:10,015
ROSS ULBRICHT'S CASE
IS A BITCOIN CASE.

814
00:39:10,048 --> 00:39:11,683
THERE'S ABSOLUTELY
NO DENYING IT.

815
00:39:11,717 --> 00:39:14,753
THE LEVEL OF THREAT
THAT THE SILK ROAD POSED

816
00:39:14,786 --> 00:39:16,888
TO THE MARKETPLACE,
TO WALL STREET,

817
00:39:16,922 --> 00:39:19,625
WHETHER IT'S A PERCEIVED THREAT
OR AN ACTUAL THREAT,

818
00:39:19,658 --> 00:39:21,560
WAS HUMONGOUS.

819
00:39:21,593 --> 00:39:25,664
AND THE IDEA THAT SOMEBODY
COULD CREATE A MARKETPLACE

820
00:39:25,697 --> 00:39:29,768
WHERE YOU COULD
FREELY TRANSACT WITHOUT
OVERSIGHT OR REGULATION

821
00:39:29,801 --> 00:39:34,072
HAD TO BE DEALT
A MASSIVE AND PUBLIC BLOW.

822
00:39:34,105 --> 00:39:39,711
BITCOIN KIND OF MONETIZED
THAT ANONYMOUS PART
OF THE INTERNET

823
00:39:39,745 --> 00:39:41,847
AND MADE IT POSSIBLE
TO TRADE IN THINGS

824
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:45,451
THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT
DOESN'T WANT YOU TO TRADE IN.

825
00:39:45,484 --> 00:39:47,453
LAW ENFORCEMENT
MOVES SLOWLY

826
00:39:47,486 --> 00:39:50,155
BUT IT'S A BIG HEAVY WHEEL
THAT GRINDS FINELY,

827
00:39:50,188 --> 00:39:52,991
SO, YOU KNOW, SOMEONE
WAS RUNNING A HIDDEN SERVICE,

828
00:39:53,024 --> 00:39:54,926
AND NOW THEY'RE
IN PRISON FOR LIFE.

829
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:57,195
THEY WERE PLAYING HARDBALL.
IT WAS VERY EVIDENT

830
00:39:57,228 --> 00:40:02,067
THAT THEIR INTENTION,
AS THE JUDGE HERSELF SAID
IN HER SENTENCING,

831
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:03,835
WAS TO MAKE AN EXAMPLE
OUT OF ROSS,

832
00:40:03,869 --> 00:40:06,872
WAS TO SAY TO ALL OF YOU
PEOPLE USING BITCOIN,

833
00:40:06,905 --> 00:40:08,840
TO ALL OF YOU PEOPLE
WHO WANT TO TANGLE

834
00:40:08,874 --> 00:40:12,944
WITH UNREGULATED MARKETPLACES
AND TECHNOLOGIES

835
00:40:12,978 --> 00:40:15,213
AND OPEN SOURCE
CRYPTOCURRENCIES,

836
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:20,018
"WE WILL THROW THE BOOK
IN ITS ENTIRETY AT YOU
IF YOU DO THIS."

837
00:40:20,051 --> 00:40:22,020
WE SEIZED A WHOLE BUNCH
OF BITCOINS.

838
00:40:22,053 --> 00:40:26,224
AND IN ORDER TO SELL
THOSE BITCOINS OFF
OR GO TO AN EXCHANGE,

839
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:29,595
YOU HAVE TO FIT WITHIN
FEDERAL LAW AND STATE LAW.

840
00:40:29,628 --> 00:40:31,162
THERE'S NOT REALLY AN EXCHANGE
THAT COULD HANDLE THAT,

841
00:40:31,196 --> 00:40:33,999
THAT MET THOSE REGULATIONS
AT THE CURRENT TIME,

842
00:40:34,032 --> 00:40:35,867
SO IT HAD TO BE HANDLED
THROUGH AUCTION.

843
00:40:47,112 --> 00:40:48,947
[WOMAN]
YOU KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT BITCOINS?

844
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:53,619
THERE'S AN ARTICLE
IN "THE WALL STREET JOURNAL"
TODAY

845
00:40:53,652 --> 00:40:56,087
- ON BITCOINS.
- [WOMAN] REALLY?

846
00:40:56,121 --> 00:40:58,189
RIGHT HERE,
IF YOU WANT TO READ IT.

847
00:40:58,223 --> 00:41:00,726
IT IS?

848
00:41:00,759 --> 00:41:02,160
DIGITAL CURRENCY,
DID YOU SEE THAT?

849
00:41:02,193 --> 00:41:04,195
[WOMAN #2]
WOW, OH!

850
00:41:04,229 --> 00:41:06,965
"DIGITAL CURRENCIES
WILL DISRUPT GLOBAL FINANCE,

851
00:41:06,998 --> 00:41:09,000
TRANSFORM THE WAY
WE PAY FOR THINGS,

852
00:41:09,034 --> 00:41:12,504
AND JUST MAYBE,
MAKE THE WORLD A FAIRER PLACE."

853
00:41:12,538 --> 00:41:14,072
FROM WHAT I'VE READ
ON THE COMPUTER,

854
00:41:14,105 --> 00:41:15,641
THEY HAVE HAD
SOME PROBLEMS.

855
00:41:18,544 --> 00:41:20,746
- YEAH.
- YEAH.

856
00:41:20,779 --> 00:41:23,181
THE REASON IS
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T TRACK IT.

857
00:41:23,214 --> 00:41:26,585
WELL, I THINK I DON'T LIKE
THIS IDEA AT ALL.

858
00:41:31,623 --> 00:41:33,124
[ANDRESEN]
WHEN WE SAW
THE SILK ROAD SHUT DOWN,

859
00:41:33,158 --> 00:41:34,860
A LOT OF PEOPLE SAID,

860
00:41:34,893 --> 00:41:37,195
"BITCOIN'S NOTHING BUT
ILLEGAL DRUGS ON THE INTERNET.

861
00:41:37,228 --> 00:41:38,864
THAT'S WHAT IT IS."

862
00:41:38,897 --> 00:41:40,632
AND THEY WOULD POINT
AT THE SILK ROAD AND SAY,

863
00:41:40,666 --> 00:41:43,001
"LOOK HERE
AT ALL THE STUFF
THAT'S HAPPENING HERE."

864
00:41:43,034 --> 00:41:46,304
AND I THINK WHEN YOU SAW
THE SILK ROAD SHUT DOWN

865
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:48,239
AND BITCOIN
TRANSACTION VOLUME

866
00:41:48,273 --> 00:41:50,609
TAKE A TINY LITTLE DIP,

867
00:41:50,642 --> 00:41:52,778
AND THEN KEEP GOING UP,

868
00:41:52,811 --> 00:41:55,246
YOU KNOW, I THINK THAT WAS
A GREAT EVENT TO POINT AT

869
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:58,984
AND SAY, "IT REALLY
WASN'T ABOUT THAT.

870
00:41:59,017 --> 00:42:00,952
IT REALLY ISN'T ABOUT THAT."

871
00:42:00,986 --> 00:42:03,054
IT'S A TINY LITTLE PART
OF THE ECONOMY.

872
00:42:09,094 --> 00:42:10,762
[PETER CAVENAUGH]
I GUESS IN THE LAST WEEK

873
00:42:10,796 --> 00:42:13,599
I'VE REALLY STARTED
HEARING ABOUT BITCOIN.

874
00:42:13,632 --> 00:42:15,166
RECENTLY I HEARD
A SCENARIO

875
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,969
AFTER THE FBI HAD SEIZED
A BUNCH OF BITCOINS

876
00:42:18,003 --> 00:42:19,838
DUE TO ILLEGAL TRANSACTIONS,

877
00:42:19,871 --> 00:42:21,172
NOW THEY'RE GONNA BE
AUCTIONING THEM OFF

878
00:42:21,206 --> 00:42:23,642
LIKE THEY WOULD
A PRIVATE YACHT

879
00:42:23,675 --> 00:42:26,077
FOR, YOU KNOW,
FROM SOME DRUG DEALER.

880
00:42:26,111 --> 00:42:30,181
SO THAT, IN A WAY,
LEGITIMIZES THE USE OF IT

881
00:42:30,215 --> 00:42:32,217
AS A CURRENCY.

882
00:42:37,088 --> 00:42:41,927
[SPANOS]
LOOKS LIKE
IT'S THE FIRST LIVE

883
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:45,597
BITCOIN EXCHANGE
ON WALL STREET.

884
00:42:45,631 --> 00:42:47,098
LOOKS THAT WAY.

885
00:42:48,834 --> 00:42:50,702
YEAH, SO ONE FOR 950.

886
00:42:50,736 --> 00:42:52,604
-BUYING OR SELLING?
-[MAN] SELLING.

887
00:42:52,638 --> 00:42:54,272
550 ON A THOUSAND--

888
00:42:54,305 --> 00:42:58,243
RIGHT NOW WE WERE LOOKING
AT THE OPEN INTEREST

889
00:42:58,276 --> 00:43:00,812
AT THE FLOOR OF
THE BITCOIN EXCHANGE.

890
00:43:00,846 --> 00:43:04,015
THERE'S DIFFERENT
EXCHANGES THAT ARE ONLINE,

891
00:43:04,049 --> 00:43:05,383
THAT WILL PRESENT
AT THE BIDDING HOUSE,

892
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:09,621
BUT THERE'S NO TRUE
OPEN OUTCRY EXCHANGE.

893
00:43:09,655 --> 00:43:11,222
BUYERS AND SELLERS
COMING TOGETHER

894
00:43:11,256 --> 00:43:14,793
IN AN OPEN, CLEAR,
TRANSPARENT, HONEST WAY.

895
00:43:16,695 --> 00:43:19,197
-GOX IS THE HIGHEST ONE.
-WHY DON'T WE CALL IT 900?

896
00:43:19,230 --> 00:43:20,632
900...

897
00:43:26,004 --> 00:43:27,372
THERE'S MY TRANSACTION,

898
00:43:27,405 --> 00:43:29,340
PROBABLY THE FIRST TWO
TRANSACTIONS OF THE DAY.

899
00:43:29,374 --> 00:43:30,742
IT'S REALLY
NOT ABOUT THE MONEY,

900
00:43:30,776 --> 00:43:32,310
IT'S ABOUT BEING INVOLVED,

901
00:43:32,343 --> 00:43:34,212
AND I THINK THERE'S A LOT
MORE PEOPLE GONNA FOLLOW ME.

902
00:43:40,218 --> 00:43:42,187
[TRISH REGAN]
CHARLIE SHREM,
24 YEARS OLD,

903
00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:44,656
ARRESTED TODAY
AND CHARGED WITH ENGAGING
IN MONEY LAUNDERING

904
00:43:44,690 --> 00:43:48,059
SHREM ENABLED PEOPLE
TO TRANSFER MONEY

905
00:43:48,093 --> 00:43:50,996
FROM BITCOIN TO CASH
VIA HIS COMPANY
CALLED BITINSTANT.

906
00:43:51,029 --> 00:43:52,798
NOW THE OTHER POINT
THAT THE DEA IS MAKING

907
00:43:52,831 --> 00:43:56,301
IS THAT SHREM BOUGHT DRUGS
ONLINE AT SILK ROAD

908
00:43:56,334 --> 00:44:00,338
AND THAT HE KNEW SILK ROAD
WAS A TRAFFICKING WEBSITE.

909
00:44:00,371 --> 00:44:02,741
[NEWSCASTER]
AND WE KNOW
THE WINKLEVOSS TWINS

910
00:44:02,774 --> 00:44:05,911
WHO OBVIOUSLY WERE FEATURED
IN THE MOVIE ABOUT FACEBOOK.

911
00:44:05,944 --> 00:44:09,080
THEY'RE ACTUALLY INVESTORS
IN SHREM'S COMPANY.

912
00:44:09,114 --> 00:44:12,851
YEAH, YOU KNOW,
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE VERY
EXCITED BY THIS IDEA.

913
00:44:12,884 --> 00:44:15,220
THEY LIKE THE IDEA THAT
YOU CAN HAVE A CURRENCY

914
00:44:15,253 --> 00:44:17,923
THAT IS NOT TIED
TO ANY KIND OF CENTRAL BANK,

915
00:44:17,956 --> 00:44:19,758
BUT AT THE SAME TIME,
I MEAN, THINK ABOUT IT.

916
00:44:19,791 --> 00:44:21,059
IF YOU'RE IN
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT,

917
00:44:21,092 --> 00:44:22,694
YOU DON'T LIKE THE IDEA
THAT PEOPLE COULD

918
00:44:22,728 --> 00:44:25,330
EFFECTIVELY USE ANOTHER
FORM OF CASH

919
00:44:25,363 --> 00:44:29,267
TO BUY THINGS THAT THEY
SHOULDN'T BE BUYING ONLINE.

920
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:32,370
[SHREM]
WITH ME, IT WASN'T ALL
MY CUSTOMERS.

921
00:44:32,403 --> 00:44:34,105
IT WAS ONE CUSTOMER,

922
00:44:34,139 --> 00:44:36,441
OUT OF ABOUT
100,000 CUSTOMERS.

923
00:44:36,474 --> 00:44:38,810
THIS WAS ONE CUSTOMER.
ONE SINGLE--

924
00:44:38,844 --> 00:44:40,178
AND I MADE THAT CASE
IN MY SENTENCING.

925
00:44:40,211 --> 00:44:42,714
I SAID, "YOUR HONOR,
THIS WAS ONE CUSTOMER."

926
00:44:42,748 --> 00:44:46,317
IT HAPPENED THAT I WAS LITERALLY
COMING HOME FROM AMSTERDAM.

927
00:44:46,351 --> 00:44:47,919
I WAS IN MY SWEATSHIRT.
I WAS STILL STONED.

928
00:44:47,953 --> 00:44:49,154
I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT WAS GOING ON.

929
00:44:49,187 --> 00:44:51,857
CHARLIE DID NOT KNOW
WHEN TO SHUT UP,

930
00:44:51,890 --> 00:44:54,993
AND THAT ENDED UP
GETTING HIM IN TROUBLE,

931
00:44:55,026 --> 00:44:57,963
AND PROBABLY LED TO THE END
OF HIS COMPANY.

932
00:44:57,996 --> 00:44:59,297
[SHREM]
BUT THEY GOT ME UNDER
THE PATRIOT ACT,

933
00:44:59,330 --> 00:45:00,866
AND IT'S MONEY LAUNDERING

934
00:45:00,899 --> 00:45:03,168
BECAUSE I KNEW THAT
THE MONEY I WAS TAKING

935
00:45:03,201 --> 00:45:07,072
WAS EVENTUALLY POSSIBLY
GOING TO BE USED FOR DRUG
TRAFFICKING.

936
00:45:07,105 --> 00:45:09,808
NOW DRUG TRAFFICKING
IS NOT BUYING DRUGS,
IT'S SELLING DRUGS.

937
00:45:09,841 --> 00:45:11,309
I DIDN'T HELP
THE DRUG SELLER.

938
00:45:11,342 --> 00:45:13,044
I HELPED THE GUY
BUY DRUGS.

939
00:45:13,078 --> 00:45:15,781
BUT I NEVER WENT
TO TRIAL BECAUSE--

940
00:45:15,814 --> 00:45:19,517
AND I PLED GUILTY BECAUSE
WHO WINS AT TRIAL, YOU KNOW?

941
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:22,353
LIKE THIS GUY, SILK ROAD,
HE'S GONNA GO TO LIFE.

942
00:45:22,387 --> 00:45:24,255
IN TRIAL,
ALL HE NEEDED TO GET
WAS A LADY

943
00:45:24,289 --> 00:45:26,758
WHOSE SON DIED
FROM A COCAINE OVERDOSE

944
00:45:26,792 --> 00:45:29,828
AND I WOULD'VE--
THE JURY WOULD'VE CONVICTED ME
RIGHT THERE.

945
00:45:29,861 --> 00:45:32,163
SO ESSENTIALLY CHARLIE WAS
SELLING BITCOINS TO A GUY

946
00:45:32,197 --> 00:45:34,032
WHO WAS SELLING
BITCOINS TO PEOPLE

947
00:45:34,065 --> 00:45:37,468
WHO WERE PUTTING DRUGS
INTO THEIR OWN BODIES.

948
00:45:37,502 --> 00:45:40,205
AND FOR THIS,
CHARLIE WAS CHARGED
WITH CRIMES

949
00:45:40,238 --> 00:45:43,141
THAT COULD'VE PUT HIM
IN JAIL FOR 20 YEARS.

950
00:45:43,174 --> 00:45:44,976
THAT'S WHAT THE PROSECUTORS
WERE SHOOTING FOR.

951
00:45:45,010 --> 00:45:47,946
WE HAVE BANKS
THAT HAVE ATMS

952
00:45:47,979 --> 00:45:49,447
ON EVERY STREET CORNER
IN AMERICA,

953
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:51,783
AND THOSE BANKS
KNOW VERY WELL

954
00:45:51,817 --> 00:45:53,251
THAT THAT CASH
IS GETTING USED FOR DRUGS.

955
00:45:53,284 --> 00:45:54,920
AND YET,
THAT'S FINE.

956
00:45:54,953 --> 00:45:56,822
THEY'RE ALLOWED TO DO THAT.
NO ONE GETS IN TROUBLE.

957
00:45:56,855 --> 00:45:59,024
BUT CHARLIE SELLS BITCOIN
TO A GUY WHO SELLS BITCOIN

958
00:45:59,057 --> 00:46:01,259
TO SOMEONE WHO USES DRUGS,
AND HE GOES TO JAIL.

959
00:46:01,292 --> 00:46:04,529
HE WAS AN ENTREPRENEUR THAT
STARTED BUILDING THIS INDUSTRY,

960
00:46:04,562 --> 00:46:07,132
BUILT SERVICES
THAT PEOPLE FOUND USEFUL,

961
00:46:07,165 --> 00:46:09,300
WHEN BANKERS ALMOST DESTROYED
THE WORLD ECONOMY

962
00:46:09,334 --> 00:46:12,904
AND NONE OF THEM
GOT IN TROUBLE WHATSOEVER.

963
00:46:12,938 --> 00:46:15,440
AND HERE WE HAVE THIS
23-YEAR-OLD KID,
HE GOES TO JAIL

964
00:46:15,473 --> 00:46:18,209
BECAUSE HE STARTED
BUILDING AN ALTERNATIVE.

[BENJAMIN LAWSKY]
OVER THE LAST SIX MONTHS,

966
00:46:29,454 --> 00:46:32,357

AN EXTENSIVE INQUIRY

IN THIS FACT-FINDING EFFORT

00:46:39,865 --> 00:46:41,466
WILL ALLOW US

00:46:41,499 --> 00:46:44,035
DURING THE COURSE
OF 2014,

00:47:20,906 --> 00:47:23,608

OR EXTREME OPTIMISTS.

00:47:30,916 --> 00:47:33,118
[VOORHEES]
BITCOIN IS
A BATTLE OF IDEAS,

990
00:47:33,151 --> 00:47:35,553
AND IT FORCES THE ISSUE OF
WHETHER PEOPLE SHOULD BE

991
00:47:35,586 --> 00:47:38,523
AS FREE IN THEIR HANDLING
OF MONEY AS THEY ARE

992
00:47:38,556 --> 00:47:40,558
IN THEIR HANDLING
OF SPEECH OR RELIGION

993
00:47:40,591 --> 00:47:42,928
OR RELATIONSHIPS
WITH EACH OTHER.

994
00:47:42,961 --> 00:47:45,997
IF YOU WANT TO HAVE
THIS THING GO MAINSTREAM,

995
00:47:46,031 --> 00:47:48,266
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE
TO HAVE THE REGULATORS,

996
00:47:48,299 --> 00:47:49,968
THE LAWMAKERS
WEIGH IN ON IT.

997
00:47:50,001 --> 00:47:52,137
ONE OF THE FIRST ONES
WHO REALLY TOOK AN INTEREST

998
00:47:52,170 --> 00:47:53,671
WAS BENJAMIN LAWSKY.

999
00:47:53,704 --> 00:47:56,274
VERY IMPORTANT REGULATOR
IN THE FINANCIAL WORLD.

1000
00:47:56,307 --> 00:47:59,544
AND IN JANUARY, 2014,
HOLDS THESE PUBLIC HEARINGS

1001
00:47:59,577 --> 00:48:01,913
BECAUSE HE WANTS
TO COME UP WITH A LICENSE

1002
00:48:01,947 --> 00:48:04,182
FOR BITCOIN COMPANIES.

1003
00:48:04,215 --> 00:48:06,117
WE BELIEVE
THAT PUTTING IN PLACE

1004
00:48:06,151 --> 00:48:08,686
APPROPRIATE
REGULATORY SAFEGUARDS
FOR VIRTUAL CURRENCIES

1005
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:11,022
WILL ULTIMATELY
BE BENEFICIAL

1006
00:48:11,056 --> 00:48:14,559
TO THE LONG-TERM STRENGTH
OF THE INDUSTRY ITSELF.

1007
00:48:14,592 --> 00:48:17,595
LAWSKY WAS ESSENTIALLY
GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY

1008
00:48:17,628 --> 00:48:22,300
TO WRITE THE RULES
FOR THIS WHOLE NEW INDUSTRY
FROM SCRATCH.

1009
00:48:22,333 --> 00:48:24,535
[LAWSKY]
THE FIRST QUESTION
IS THE OBVIOUS ONE

1010
00:48:24,569 --> 00:48:25,971
THAT'S ON EVERYONE'S MIND.

1011
00:48:26,004 --> 00:48:27,973
SORT OF UNEXPECTED YESTERDAY,

1012
00:48:28,006 --> 00:48:30,208
BUT WITH THE ARRESTS
WE SAW OBVIOUSLY

1013
00:48:30,241 --> 00:48:32,310
THAT'S PUT A BIT OF A CLOUD

1014
00:48:32,343 --> 00:48:34,079
HANGING OVER
THE INDUSTRY RIGHT NOW,

1015
00:48:34,112 --> 00:48:37,582
AND SO HOW DO EACH OF YOU REACT
TO WHAT WE SAW YESTERDAY,

1016
00:48:37,615 --> 00:48:41,452
WHAT IT MEANS FOR BITCOIN
OR VIRTUAL CURRENCY
AND ITS FUTURE?

1017
00:48:41,486 --> 00:48:44,422
I THINK IT FURTHER
SUPPORTS THAT

1018
00:48:44,455 --> 00:48:46,424
BAD GUYS ARE GONNA DO
BAD THINGS,

1019
00:48:46,457 --> 00:48:49,060
AND THEY'RE GONNA
USE WHATEVER TECHNOLOGY
IS AVAILABLE TO THEM.

1020
00:48:49,094 --> 00:48:51,997
BUT I VIEW IT AS,
IF THE ALLEGATIONS ARE TRUE
AND THEY'RE CONVICTED,

1021
00:48:52,030 --> 00:48:54,332
THE SYSTEM WORKS.

1022
00:48:54,365 --> 00:48:56,501
[FRED WILSON]
ARE PEOPLE STILL DOING BAD
THINGS WITH BITCOIN?

1023
00:48:56,534 --> 00:49:00,138
SURE. IS THE MAJORITY OF
THE BITCOIN ACTIVITY VICE?

1024
00:49:00,171 --> 00:49:01,306
NOT A CHANCE.

1025
00:49:01,339 --> 00:49:02,607
SO I THINK
THE ISSUE YOU RAISE

1026
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:05,276
IS ONE THAT PEOPLE
LIKE TO WRITE ABOUT,

1027
00:49:05,310 --> 00:49:07,645
THE MEDIA LIKES
TO WRITE ABOUT IT,
MAKES GREAT HEADLINES.

1028
00:49:07,678 --> 00:49:09,614
YOU GET A LOT OF CLICKS.
YOU CAN SELL A LOT OF ADS,

1029
00:49:09,647 --> 00:49:12,984
BUT I THINK
IT'S IN THE REARVIEW MIRROR.

1030
00:49:13,018 --> 00:49:15,620
THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE
IN THE BITCOIN COMMUNITY

1031
00:49:15,653 --> 00:49:17,722
FROM THE LIBERTARIAN
SIDE OF THINGS

1032
00:49:17,755 --> 00:49:20,725
THAT WANT GOVERNMENT
TO JUST LEAVE IT ALONE.

1033
00:49:20,758 --> 00:49:24,595
WOULD YOU SAY REGULATION
IS BOTH INEVITABLE

1034
00:49:24,629 --> 00:49:26,764
BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY,
ACTUALLY ULTIMATELY

1035
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:29,700
GOING TO BE CRUCIAL
FOR THE SURVIVAL
OF VIRTUAL CURRENCY?

1036
00:49:29,734 --> 00:49:31,536
[WILSON]
SOUNDS LIKE A TERRIBLE
IDEA TO ME.

1037
00:49:31,569 --> 00:49:33,171
JUST UNDERSTAND WHAT WE'RE
TRYING TO DO WITH BITCOIN.

1038
00:49:33,204 --> 00:49:35,206
WE'RE TRYING
TO CREATE A WORLD

1039
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:39,644
WHERE TRANSACTIONS
CAN MOVE GLOBALLY FOR FREE,
OKAY?

1040
00:49:39,677 --> 00:49:43,414
AND MAKING
THESE COMPANIES HIRE

1041
00:49:43,448 --> 00:49:45,650
YOU KNOW, SOME OUTSOURCED
COMPLIANCE FIRM

1042
00:49:45,683 --> 00:49:47,618
IS A BAD IDEA.

1043
00:49:47,652 --> 00:49:49,354
IT'D BE GREAT,
IN ANY INDUSTRY,

1044
00:49:49,387 --> 00:49:51,189
IF YOU COULD JUST
OPEN THE DOOR AND LET FOLKS

1045
00:49:51,222 --> 00:49:52,723
RUN OUT AND
GIVE IT A SHOT.

1046
00:49:52,757 --> 00:49:55,393
WE MAY CHOOSE NOT
TO INVEST IN A COMPANY

1047
00:49:55,426 --> 00:49:58,696
IF THEY CAN'T
GET LICENSED BY YOU.

1048
00:49:58,729 --> 00:50:01,199
[LAWSKY]
IF THE CHOICE ULTIMATELY
IS BETWEEN

1049
00:50:01,232 --> 00:50:03,568
PREVENTING MONEY LAUNDERING
ON THE ONE HAND,

1050
00:50:03,601 --> 00:50:06,137
AND I PROBABLY
SHOULDN'T EVEN USE THE WORD
"MONEY LAUNDERING"

1051
00:50:06,171 --> 00:50:07,805
'CAUSE IT'S TOO NICE
A WORD, FRANKLY.

1052
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:10,508
MONEY LAUNDERING
IS THE FACILITATION

1053
00:50:10,541 --> 00:50:12,410
OF ALL KINDS
OF HORRIFIC CRIMES

1054
00:50:12,443 --> 00:50:14,179
THAT I THINK
EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM

1055
00:50:14,212 --> 00:50:15,646
NEVER WANTS TO SEE HAPPEN.

1056
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:18,449
ACTS OF TERRORISM,
FUNDING ROGUE NATIONS, ETC.,

1057
00:50:18,483 --> 00:50:20,785
ALL TAKE PLACE THROUGH
MASSIVE MONEY LAUNDERING.

1058
00:50:20,818 --> 00:50:22,820
NOW THE CHOICE
FOR THE REGULATOR IS,

1059
00:50:22,853 --> 00:50:25,223
PERMIT MONEY LAUNDERING
ON THE ONE HAND,

1060
00:50:25,256 --> 00:50:29,127
OR PERMIT INNOVATION
ON THE OTHER.

1061
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:31,262
WE'RE ALWAYS
GOING TO CHOOSE

1062
00:50:31,296 --> 00:50:33,131
SQUELCHING
THE MONEY LAUNDERING FIRST.

1063
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:38,803
I AGREE THAT I DON'T THINK
ANYBODY WANTS MONEY LAUNDERING.

1064
00:50:38,836 --> 00:50:41,806
WHEN WE GOT A--
FIRST SAW BITCOIN

1065
00:50:41,839 --> 00:50:43,841
YOU KNOW, ABOUT A YEAR AND
A HALF, ALMOST TWO YEARS AGO.

1066
00:50:43,874 --> 00:50:44,775
I DON'T THINK
ANYBODY WOULD DENY

1067
00:50:44,809 --> 00:50:46,577
THAT IT WAS A BIT
OF A WILD, WILD WEST,

1068
00:50:46,611 --> 00:50:48,113
BECAUSE THERE WAS
NO REGULATION.

1069
00:50:48,146 --> 00:50:50,515
THERE WAS NO FRAMEWORK
TO EVALUATE

1070
00:50:50,548 --> 00:50:52,750
THE ASSET,
EVALUATE COMPANIES,

1071
00:50:52,783 --> 00:50:55,420
DETERMINE WHO WAS COMPLIANT
AND WHO WAS NOT,

1072
00:50:55,453 --> 00:50:57,822
AND A WILD WEST
ATTRACTS COWBOYS.

1073
00:50:57,855 --> 00:51:00,858
AND I DON'T THINK ANYBODY HERE
WOULD DISAGREE WITH THE FACT

1074
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:03,661
THAT A SHERIFF
WOULD BE A GOOD THING.

1075
00:51:03,694 --> 00:51:05,296
[VOORHEES]
A LOT OF, I THINK,
THE ENTREPRENEURS

1076
00:51:05,330 --> 00:51:07,465
FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE
TO SELF-CENSOR.

1077
00:51:07,498 --> 00:51:10,835
THEY DON'T WANT TO COME OUT
VOCALLY CRITICAL
OF THE REGULATIONS.

1078
00:51:10,868 --> 00:51:12,570
PART OF THAT IS MAYBE
'CAUSE SOME OF THEM

1079
00:51:12,603 --> 00:51:13,771
JUST LIKE REGULATIONS,

1080
00:51:13,804 --> 00:51:15,340
BUT I THINK ANOTHER
PART OF IT,

1081
00:51:15,373 --> 00:51:17,742
SOME OF THEM JUST FEEL LIKE
THEY WILL GET

1082
00:51:17,775 --> 00:51:20,178
ATTENTION OF THE REGULATORS
IF THEY COME OUT AGAINST THEM.

1083
00:51:20,211 --> 00:51:22,313
YES, WE WANT THEM TO INNOVATE,
BUT AT THE SAME TIME,

1084
00:51:22,347 --> 00:51:25,683
WE JUST CAN'T LIVE IN A WORLD
WHERE WE'RE GONNA PERMIT

1085
00:51:25,716 --> 00:51:27,485
MONEY LAUNDERING
TO GO ON.

1086
00:51:27,518 --> 00:51:29,287
[ANDRESEN]
I THINK REGULATORS
SHOULD GIVE BITCOIN

1087
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:30,421
SOME TIME TO GROW UP.

1088
00:51:30,455 --> 00:51:32,290
TOO MUCH REGULATION NOW

1089
00:51:32,323 --> 00:51:33,824
WILL JUST
STIFLE INNOVATION.

1090
00:51:33,858 --> 00:51:37,128
I THINK BEFORE REGULATORS
KIND OF COME IN AND SAY,

1091
00:51:37,162 --> 00:51:38,663
"WE'RE GONNA SOLVE
ALL YOUR PROBLEMS,"

1092
00:51:38,696 --> 00:51:41,166
AND THEN FAIL
TO SOLVE ALL THEIR PROBLEMS,

1093
00:51:41,199 --> 00:51:43,268
I THINK THEY SHOULD GIVE
THE INNOVATORS TIME

1094
00:51:43,301 --> 00:51:45,236
TO SOLVE THOSE PROBLEMS.

1095
00:51:45,270 --> 00:51:48,573
ONE FUNCTION OF REGULATION
IS TO MAKE THINGS CLEARER,

1096
00:51:48,606 --> 00:51:51,242
SO RIGHT NOW BITCOIN,
BECAUSE IT'S SO NEW,

1097
00:51:51,276 --> 00:51:54,545
IS IN A STATE OF FLUX
EVERYWHERE.

1098
00:51:54,579 --> 00:51:55,613
THE LESSON
FROM THE INTERNET

1099
00:51:55,646 --> 00:51:57,748
IS ANYTHING
THAT CHINA BANS,

1100
00:51:57,782 --> 00:51:58,749
INVEST IN.

[LAUGHTER]

1102
00:52:00,885 --> 00:52:04,455
AND THAT'S A JOKE,
BUT THE U.S.

1103
00:52:04,489 --> 00:52:07,625
ALLOWS GOOGLE TO OPERATE HERE,
ALLOWS TWITTER TO OPERATE HERE,

1104

TO OPERATE HERE,

ALLOWS FACEBOOK
TO OPERATE HERE.

1106

DOESN'T ALLOW ANY OF THOSE
COMPANIES TO OPERATE

1107
00:52:13,964 --> 00:52:18,469
THE WAY THEY OPERATE
IN THIS COUNTRY,
OR AT ALL.

1108
00:52:18,503 --> 00:52:20,538
THIS IS ABOUT FREEDOM,
ULTIMATELY.

1109
00:52:20,571 --> 00:52:22,873
YOU KNOW, WE'RE 50 YARDS

1110
00:52:22,907 --> 00:52:24,609
FROM THE OLD
WORLD TRADE CENTER HERE

1111
00:52:24,642 --> 00:52:27,378
AND I THINK ALL OF US
NEVER WANT TO SEE

1112
00:52:27,412 --> 00:52:29,714
ANYTHING LIKE THAT HAPPEN
AGAIN, AND IT WOULD HAVE
BEEN A LOT HARDER

1113
00:52:29,747 --> 00:52:31,449
FOR 9/11
TO EVER HAVE OCCURRED

1114
00:52:31,482 --> 00:52:32,717
HAD WE HAD
THE PROTECTIONS IN PLACE

1115
00:52:32,750 --> 00:52:34,519
THAT WOULD
PREVENT THE MOVEMENT

1116
00:52:34,552 --> 00:52:36,921
OF MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF MONEY
AROUND THE GLOBE

1117
00:52:36,954 --> 00:52:41,292
BY PEOPLE WHO WOULD
WANT TO KILL EVERYBODY
IN THIS ROOM,

1118
00:52:41,326 --> 00:52:44,295
SO I THINK THE KEY IS

1119
00:52:44,329 --> 00:52:46,697
TO NOT CREATE
USELESS REGULATION

1120
00:52:46,731 --> 00:52:50,301
BUT I THINK THE MOTIVES
BEHIND A LOT OF THOSE RULES

1121
00:52:50,335 --> 00:52:54,171
ARE TO ENSURE WE DON'T
MISS SOMETHING AGAIN.

1122
00:52:55,473 --> 00:52:56,874
[VOORHEES]
SINCE 2001,

1123
00:52:56,907 --> 00:53:00,378
THERE'S THIS ABSURD
OBSESSION WITH TERRORISM.

1124
00:53:00,411 --> 00:53:02,613
SO ANY TIME A REGULARY
GETS UP AND SAYS,

1125
00:53:02,647 --> 00:53:04,482
"WELL, BITCOIN CAN BE USED
FOR TERRORISM."

1126
00:53:04,515 --> 00:53:06,451
WELL, OF COURSE IT CAN.
SO CAN ANYTHING.

1127
00:53:06,484 --> 00:53:08,886
SO CAN CELL PHONES
AND SO CAN THE INTERNET
AND SO CAN THE CAR.

1128
00:53:08,919 --> 00:53:12,557
IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT
WE SHOULD STIFLE THE GROWTH
OF THOSE INDUSTRIES

1129
00:53:12,590 --> 00:53:14,359
JUST BECAUSE BAD PEOPLE
CAN USE IT.

1130
00:53:29,974 --> 00:53:31,976
[NEWSCASTER]
THIS HAS ARGUABLY BEEN
THE WORST WEEK

1131
00:53:32,009 --> 00:53:33,844
IN THE CRYPTOCURRENCY'S
SHORT LIFE,

1132
00:53:33,878 --> 00:53:38,283
STUNNED BY THE COLLAPSE
OF ONCE-DOMINANT EXCHANGE
MT. GOX.

1133
00:53:38,316 --> 00:53:42,387
NOW THAT FAILED FIRM'S CEO
MARK KARPELES IS IN HIDING.

1134
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:46,824

ALLEGEDLY STOLEN OR LOST

1135
00:53:46,857 --> 00:53:50,628
WHICH ACCOUNTS FOR ABOUT 6%
OF THE TOTAL CIRCULATION.

1136
00:53:52,497 --> 00:53:53,998
[POPPER]
BY THE TIME
MT. GOX WENT DOWN,

1137
00:53:54,031 --> 00:53:57,034
IT WAS HOLDING WHAT
ITS CUSTOMERS BELIEVED

1138
00:53:57,067 --> 00:53:59,504
WERE ABOUT
A HALF A BILLION DOLLARS

1139
00:53:59,537 --> 00:54:02,307
WORTH OF THEIR BITCOINS
AND THE COMPANY'S BITCOINS.

1140
00:54:02,340 --> 00:54:05,710
IT WAS NO LONGER THE LARGEST
EXCHANGE IN THE WORLD.

1141
00:54:05,743 --> 00:54:07,745
BUT PART OF
WHAT'S SO AMAZING IS

1142
00:54:07,778 --> 00:54:10,481
THAT PEOPLE KEPT USING IT

1143
00:54:10,515 --> 00:54:13,551
EVEN AFTER THERE HAD BEEN
NUMEROUS INCIDENTS

1144
00:54:13,584 --> 00:54:15,386
IN WHICH IT WAS CLEAR
THAT THE COMPANY

1145
00:54:15,420 --> 00:54:17,955
WAS NOT UP TO THE TASK
OF SAFEGUARDING THE MONEY.

1146
00:54:24,929 --> 00:54:27,498
AND THE ONLY REASON HE SURVIVED
AS LONG AS HE DID

1147
00:54:27,532 --> 00:54:29,900
WAS BECAUSE IN 2013,
THE PRICE STARTED GOING UP.

00:54:29,934 --> 00:54:31,702
PEOPLE KEPT
PUTTING MONEY INTO IT.

1149
00:54:31,736 --> 00:54:33,938
HE HAD MORE AND MORE MONEY
'CAUSE THE PRICE WAS GOING UP,

1150
00:54:33,971 --> 00:54:35,840
BUT AS SOON AS
THE PRICE STARTED GOING DOWN,

1151
00:54:35,873 --> 00:54:36,841
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED,
RIGHT?

1152
00:54:36,874 --> 00:54:39,410
IT PEAKS IN LATE 2013.

1153
00:54:39,444 --> 00:54:40,911
IT STARTS COMING DOWN
IN 2014.

1154
00:54:40,945 --> 00:54:43,047
SOON AS THAT PRICE
STARTED COMING DOWN,

1155
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:45,383
IT ALL JUST TUMBLED FOR HIM.

1156
00:54:45,416 --> 00:54:47,485
GOX WAS GOING TO COLLAPSE.

1157
00:54:47,518 --> 00:54:48,953
THAT IT LASTED
AS LONG AS IT DID

1158
00:54:48,986 --> 00:54:51,989
WAS ACTUALLY
KIND OF A STROKE OF FATE.

1159
00:54:52,022 --> 00:54:53,558
BUT ITS FAILURE WAS

1160
00:54:53,591 --> 00:54:55,560
IT DIDN'T HAVE
THE KIND OF MORE BORING

1161
00:54:55,593 --> 00:54:57,094
MAINSTREAM
INSTITUTIONAL CONTROLS

1162
00:54:57,127 --> 00:54:59,864
THAT WE REQUIRE TO BRING IT
TO THE NEXT LEVEL.

1163
00:54:59,897 --> 00:55:02,833
AND THERE'S A WHOLE BUNCH
OF MONEY MISSING,

1164
00:55:02,867 --> 00:55:04,869
AND NO ONE KNOWS
IF THEY JUST LOST IT,

1165
00:55:04,902 --> 00:55:05,970
IT IF WAS STOLEN FROM THEM,

1166
00:55:06,003 --> 00:55:08,406
IF THEY EMBEZZLED IT OR WHAT,

1167
00:55:08,439 --> 00:55:11,008
BUT THE IMPORTANT
LESSON FROM GOX

1168
00:55:11,041 --> 00:55:13,378
ISN'T THAT BITCOIN
DOESN'T WORK.

1169
00:55:13,411 --> 00:55:15,413
THE IMPORTANT LESSON
FROM GOX

1170
00:55:15,446 --> 00:55:17,615
IS THAT YOU DON'T
LEAVE YOUR MONEY WITH
A TRUSTED THIRD PARTY

1171
00:55:17,648 --> 00:55:19,550
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T
ALWAYS TRUST THEM.

1172
00:55:19,584 --> 00:55:20,985
YOU CAN ONLY TRUST THEM
UNTIL YOU CAN'T.

1173
00:55:21,018 --> 00:55:22,787
THIS WAS ALSO A LESSON
THAT PEOPLE WERE

1174
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:24,121
SUPPOSED TO LEARN
DURING THE FINANCIAL CRISIS

1175
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:26,591
BUT THEY DON'T SEEM
TO HAVE LEARNED IT YET.

1176
00:55:29,126 --> 00:55:30,728
[VIGNA]
MARK KARPELES

1177
00:55:30,761 --> 00:55:32,797
WAS A GAMER.

1178
00:55:32,830 --> 00:55:35,065
HE WAS NOT A FINANCE PRO.

1179
00:55:35,099 --> 00:55:37,735
HE REALLY DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT HE WAS DOING,

1180
00:55:37,768 --> 00:55:40,805
AND HE DIDN'T BUILD IT.
JED MCCALEB BUILT IT.

1181
00:55:40,838 --> 00:55:42,407
HE DIDN'T IMPROVE UPON IT.

1182
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:44,609
I MEAN, IT LURCHED
FROM CRISIS TO CRISIS

1183
00:55:44,642 --> 00:55:46,844
THROUGHOUT
THE ENTIRE HISTORY.

1184
00:55:46,877 --> 00:55:50,715
LAST YEAR WAS
A TERRIBLE YEAR FOR BITCOIN,

1185
00:55:50,748 --> 00:55:52,683
AND AN ESPECIALLY
TERRIBLE YEAR FOR
THE FOUNDATION,

1186
00:55:52,717 --> 00:55:55,886
BECAUSE WE HAD
TWO OF THE PEOPLE
ON OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS

1187
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:59,657
WHO HAD TO RESIGN
IN DISGRACE, BASICALLY.

1188
00:55:59,690 --> 00:56:02,527
YOU KNOW, MY EXPERTISE
IS TECHNOLOGY.

1189
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:05,396
MY EXPERTISE IS NOT
FIGURING OUT, LIKE,

1190
00:56:05,430 --> 00:56:07,031
WHO'S TRUSTWORTHY,
WHO'S NOT,

1191
00:56:07,064 --> 00:56:08,866
WHICH BUSINESSES
ARE GONNA SUCCEED,

1192
00:56:08,899 --> 00:56:10,935
WHICH BUSINESSES
ARE GONNA FAIL.

1193
00:56:10,968 --> 00:56:12,903
[LAWSKY]
AFTER WE HAD
HELD OUR HEARINGS,

1194
00:56:12,937 --> 00:56:17,842
WE THOUGHT WE WOULD TAKE
SIX MONTHS TO NINE MONTHS,
EVEN A YEAR,

1195
00:56:17,875 --> 00:56:19,777
TO DRAFT
OUR INITIAL REGULATIONS.

1196
00:56:19,810 --> 00:56:21,446
THIS WAS SO COMPLICATED
THAT WE WANTED

1197
00:56:21,479 --> 00:56:23,881
TO REALLY TAKE OUR TIME
AND GET IT RIGHT.

1198
00:56:23,914 --> 00:56:26,817
WHAT HAPPENED WAS, THOUGH,
MT. GOX COLLAPSED.

1199
00:56:26,851 --> 00:56:28,085
AND I THINK THAT GAVE US

1200
00:56:28,118 --> 00:56:30,455
A REAL RENEWED
SENSE OF URGENCY,

1201
00:56:30,488 --> 00:56:33,157
AND WE REALIZED THAT
IF WE GOT REGULATION RIGHT,

1202
00:56:33,190 --> 00:56:36,527
WE COULD CREATE MORE CONFIDENCE
IN BITCOIN, FRANKLY,

1203
00:56:36,561 --> 00:56:38,963
AS OPPOSED TO THE SORT OF
LOSS OF CONFIDENCE YOU SAW

1204
00:56:38,996 --> 00:56:41,566
NOT ONLY
FROM THE SILK ROAD CASE

1205
00:56:41,599 --> 00:56:43,434
BUT ALSO FROM THE COLLAPSE
OF MT. GOX.

1206
00:56:43,468 --> 00:56:45,002
[NEWSCASTER]
SO YOUR SENSE, THOUGH,

1207
00:56:45,035 --> 00:56:46,771
OF THE REGULATORS,
RIGHT NOW.

1208
00:56:46,804 --> 00:56:47,938
I ASSUME YOU'VE
HAD CONVERSATIONS.

1209
00:56:47,972 --> 00:56:49,540
THE DISCUSSIONS
THAT WE'VE HAD,

1210
00:56:49,574 --> 00:56:51,509
I THINK EVERYBODY
RECOGNIZES THE INNOVATION

1211
00:56:51,542 --> 00:56:53,110
AND DOESN'T WANT
TO STIFLE IT.

1212
00:56:53,143 --> 00:56:55,480
THEY JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE
THAT THERE'S HEALTHY REGULATION

1213
00:56:55,513 --> 00:56:58,516
SO IT'S USED IN A SAFE
AND PRODUCTIVE MANNER.

1214
00:57:00,851 --> 00:57:03,153
[SPANOS]
I'M NOT GIVING UP ON NEW YORK.
NEW YORK'S GIVING UP ON ME.

1215
00:57:03,187 --> 00:57:05,690
I CAN'T EVEN TURN ON
THE BITCOIN MACHINE.

1216
00:57:05,723 --> 00:57:07,858
AN ATM,
I CAN'T TURN IT ON.

1217
00:57:07,892 --> 00:57:10,461
I CAN'T MAKE TRADES.
I CAN'T DO ANYTHING.

1218
00:57:10,495 --> 00:57:14,231
THERE'S NO CASH FLOW
AT ALL.

1219
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:16,200
AND IT'S POTENTIAL
REGULATION.

1220
00:57:16,233 --> 00:57:19,604
IT'S REGULATIONS
I SHOULD BELIEVE

1221
00:57:19,637 --> 00:57:21,639
IS COMING DOWN THE PIPE.

1222
00:57:21,672 --> 00:57:24,875
LIKE, I DON'T WANT TO DO
ANYTHING THAT SOMEONE'S
FROWNING UPON

1223
00:57:24,909 --> 00:57:27,812
RIGHT NEXT DOOR
TO THE STOCK MARKET.

1224
00:57:27,845 --> 00:57:29,113
THEY'RE GONNA LOCK ME UP.

1225
00:57:29,146 --> 00:57:30,881
YOU KNOW, YOU CAN'T
HAVE AN EXCHANGE.

1226
00:57:30,915 --> 00:57:32,683
WELL, WE DON'T.
PEOPLE MEET THERE

1227
00:57:32,717 --> 00:57:33,984
AND EXCHANGE
WITH EACH OTHER.

1228
00:57:34,018 --> 00:57:36,220
NEW YORK'S SITTING THERE
ON THE HIGH HORSE,

1229
00:57:36,253 --> 00:57:38,255
AND THE WHOLE WORLD'S
WAITING

1230
00:57:38,288 --> 00:57:41,759
ON NEW YORK TO CREATE
SOME FUCKIN' LICENSE.

1231
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:52,770
[POPPER]
ULTIMATELY LAWSKY'S OFFICE
BROUGHT OUT

1232
00:57:52,803 --> 00:57:54,672
THE FINAL RULES
FOR THE BITLICENSE

1233
00:57:54,705 --> 00:57:56,574
IN THE SPRING OF 2015.

1234
00:57:56,607 --> 00:58:00,945
A LOT OF COMPANIES COMPLAINED
THAT THE REGULATIONS

1235
00:58:00,978 --> 00:58:04,181
WERE TOO BURDENSOME FOR THEM
TO OPERATE IN NEW YORK

1236
00:58:04,214 --> 00:58:05,683
AND STILL MAKE MONEY.

1237
00:58:05,716 --> 00:58:07,284
[TUCKER]
I SAW JUST OVERNIGHT

1238
00:58:07,317 --> 00:58:09,887
DOZENS OF COMPANIES THAT WERE
ON THE VERGE OF LAUNCHING.

1239
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:12,657
THEY JUST THREW IN THE TOWEL
AND SAID, "WE CAN'T
AFFORD THIS."

1240
00:58:12,690 --> 00:58:14,859
ERIK VOORHEES' NEW COMPANY
SHAPESHIFT

1241
00:58:14,892 --> 00:58:16,994
WOULD HAVE HAD TO APPLY
FOR THE BITLICENSE

1242
00:58:17,027 --> 00:58:19,530
IF IT WANTED TO KEEP
CUSTOMERS IN NEW YORK.

1243
00:58:21,131 --> 00:58:23,701
SO, IN MY LAP HERE
I HAVE THE--

1244
00:58:23,734 --> 00:58:25,970
THE APPLICATION FORMS
FOR LICENSE TO ENGAGE

1245
00:58:26,003 --> 00:58:28,205
IN VIRTUAL CURRENCY
BUSINESS ACTIVITY,

1246
00:58:28,238 --> 00:58:31,976
WHICH IS A VERY STATIST WAY
OF SAYING THE BITLICENSE.

1247
00:58:32,009 --> 00:58:35,279
THE IS THE APPLICATION
TO BE APPROVED

1248
00:58:35,312 --> 00:58:39,884
TO DO BASICALLY WHAT WE'VE
ALL BEEN DOING FOR YEARS NOW,

1249
00:58:39,917 --> 00:58:41,919
WHICH IS BUILDING BITCOIN
COMPANIES IN NEW YORK.

1250
00:58:41,952 --> 00:58:45,856
AND A LOT OF
STUFF IN HERE I PERSONALLY
FEEL IS UNETHICAL,

1251
00:58:45,890 --> 00:58:47,558
SO WE'RE NOT GONNA
COMPLY WITH IT,

1252
00:58:47,592 --> 00:58:49,126
WHICH MEANS WE HAVE TO BLOCK
NEW YORKERS ENTIRELY.

1253
00:58:49,159 --> 00:58:50,595
AND WHEN
AN ENTIRE NEW INDUSTRY

1254
00:58:50,628 --> 00:58:52,129
STARTS BLOCKING
A PLACE LIKE NEW YORK

1255
00:58:52,162 --> 00:58:54,699
THAT USED TO BE THE FINANCIAL
CENTER OF THE WORLD,

1256
00:58:54,732 --> 00:58:58,703
HOPEFULLY SOME OF THOSE
POLITICIANS WILL TAKE NOTICE.

1257
00:58:58,736 --> 00:59:00,170
THE POINT OF IT
IS TO, ONE,

1258
00:59:00,204 --> 00:59:01,906
MAKE SURE THERE ARE ENOUGH
CONSUMER PROTECTIONS;

1259
00:59:01,939 --> 00:59:04,609
TWO, MAKE SURE WE HAVE
ADEQUATE CYBERSECURITY;

1260
00:59:04,642 --> 00:59:09,113
THREE, MAKE SURE THAT
THE COMPANIES ARE ADEQUATELY
CAPITALIZED

1261
00:59:09,146 --> 00:59:11,248
SO THEY DON'T COLLAPSE
UPON THEMSELVES.

1262
00:59:11,281 --> 00:59:14,218
[CASEY]
YOU KNOW, YOU'VE SEEN
A TUG OF WAR

1263
00:59:14,251 --> 00:59:17,354
BETWEEN THE HARD LINERS
AND THOSE WHO ARE SAYING,

1264
00:59:17,387 --> 00:59:18,923
"YOU KNOW,
YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE

1265
00:59:18,956 --> 00:59:21,726
ENOUGH SPACE
FOR INNOVATION IN HERE,"

1266
00:59:21,759 --> 00:59:24,061
AND THE SYSTEM HAS COME OUT,
I THINK,

1267
00:59:24,094 --> 00:59:26,864
PROBABLY STRONGER
AS A RESULT OF THAT

1268
00:59:26,897 --> 00:59:28,699
AND THERE'S
A WIDESPREAD VIEW

1269
00:59:28,733 --> 00:59:30,901
AMONGST CERTAINLY
THE BUSINESS BITCOIN COMMUNITY

1270
00:59:30,935 --> 00:59:33,303
THAT SOME LEVEL
OF REGULATION

1271
00:59:33,337 --> 00:59:35,039
GIVES LEGITIMACY
TO WHAT THEY'RE DOING.

1272
00:59:35,072 --> 00:59:36,741
IT GIVES PEOPLE
CONFIDENCE IN WHAT
THEY'RE DOING.

1273
00:59:36,774 --> 00:59:39,109
THIS IS AN IMPORTANT PART
OF GROWING UP.

1274
00:59:39,143 --> 00:59:41,178
ULTIMATELY, THEY'RE NOT
GOING TO GET IT RIGHT,

1275
00:59:41,211 --> 00:59:44,114
BECAUSE NO REGULATION
IS EVER RIGHT.

1276
00:59:44,148 --> 00:59:46,283
BUT I'M HIGHLY CONFIDENT

1277
00:59:46,316 --> 00:59:49,820
THAT WHATEVER HAPPENS
GOING FORWARD,

1278
00:59:49,854 --> 00:59:51,656
THE BITLICENSE
WILL BE LOOKED AT

1279
00:59:51,689 --> 00:59:53,123
AS A POSITIVE DEVELOPMENT

1280
00:59:53,157 --> 00:59:55,359
IN THE EVOLUTION OF BITCOIN

1281
00:59:55,392 --> 00:59:58,195
BECAUSE IT JUST REMOVED
ONE OF THE BIGGEST PIECES
OF UNCERTAINTY,

1282
00:59:58,228 --> 01:00:01,298
WHICH IS HOW IS THIS INDUSTRY
GOING TO BE REGULATED.

1283
01:00:01,331 --> 01:00:05,302
I THINK MOST OF US--
AT LEAST A LOT OF US--

1284
01:00:05,335 --> 01:00:07,304
THINK THAT
SENSIBLE REGULATION

1285
01:00:07,337 --> 01:00:08,706
THAT SETS GUIDELINES

1286
01:00:08,739 --> 01:00:10,775
THAT MAKES SURE
PEOPLE'S MONEY

1287
01:00:10,808 --> 01:00:12,943
DOESN'T JUST GO INTO
A BLACK HOLE

1288
01:00:12,977 --> 01:00:15,713
THAT THAT'S
A REALLY IMPORTANT THING,

1289
01:00:15,746 --> 01:00:17,214
THAT REGULATION.

1290
01:00:17,247 --> 01:00:19,316
I'M SURE SATOSHI
WOULDN'T BE HAPPY

1291
01:00:19,349 --> 01:00:20,818
TO SEE THIS KIND OF THING,

1292
01:00:20,851 --> 01:00:22,753
WHICH IS NOT BASED
ON THE LOGIC AND REASON

1293
01:00:22,787 --> 01:00:24,221
THAT A PROGRAMMER
IS USED TO.

1294
01:00:24,254 --> 01:00:27,024
I THINK A LOT OF DEVELOPERS,
UNDERSTANDABLY SO,

1295
01:00:27,057 --> 01:00:31,428
TRY TO STAY OUT OF
THE POLITICAL NONSENSE.

1296
01:00:31,461 --> 01:00:33,698
[NEWSCASTER]
IT HAS BEEN ONE OF
THE BIGGEST MYSTERIES

1297
01:00:33,731 --> 01:00:34,899
RAGING ACROSS
THE INTERNET:

1298
01:00:34,932 --> 01:00:36,934
WHO IS SATOSHI NAKAMOTO?

1299
01:00:36,967 --> 01:00:38,769
NEWSWEEK PUBLISHED
AN ARTICLE

1300
01:00:38,803 --> 01:00:41,371
CLAIMING THE MAN
IN THESE IMAGES IS
THE BITCOIN FOUNDER.

1301
01:00:41,405 --> 01:00:43,440
THE MAN WHO
CREATED BITCOIN,

1302
01:00:43,473 --> 01:00:45,175
IS KNOWN AS
THE FATHER OF BITCOIN,

1303
01:00:45,209 --> 01:00:49,046
THE ONLINE CURRENCY
NOW WORTH BILLIONS.

1304
01:00:49,079 --> 01:00:50,748
WHEN YOU ASKED HIM
ABOUT BITCOIN,

1305
01:00:50,781 --> 01:00:52,983
AND HE SAYS, "I CAN'T TALK
ABOUT THIS ANYMORE,"

1306
01:00:53,017 --> 01:00:54,919
HE WAS NOT REFERRING
TO BITCOIN.

1307
01:00:54,952 --> 01:00:57,287
BUT WITH ME, HE DEFINITELY
ACKNOWLEDGED BITCOIN.

1308
01:00:57,321 --> 01:00:58,756
I THINK AT THIS POINT NOW
HE'S SAYING

1309
01:00:58,789 --> 01:01:00,657
HE WAS CONFUSED
BY THE CONVERSATION.

1310
01:01:01,792 --> 01:01:02,927
CLEARLY SOMEBODY THOUGHT

1311
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:05,129
THAT WE DID THIS
AS AN ACT OF WAR

1312
01:01:05,162 --> 01:01:07,031
AGAINST SATOSHI NAKAMOTO
OR BITCOIN,

1313
01:01:07,064 --> 01:01:08,365
AND I WANT
TO BE VERY CLEAR

1314
01:01:08,398 --> 01:01:12,102
THAT I CERTAINLY NEVER
MEANT IT THAT WAY.

1315
01:01:12,136 --> 01:01:14,905
I HAVE NOTHING TO DO
WITH BITCOIN.

1316
01:01:14,939 --> 01:01:17,708
[VIGNA]
IT WAS A MONSTER STORY.

1317
01:01:17,742 --> 01:01:19,143
HOW DID THEY FIGURE IT OUT?

1318
01:01:19,176 --> 01:01:20,845
OH, MY GOD, LOOK AT
THIS GUY THAT THEY NAMED.

1319
01:01:20,878 --> 01:01:23,147
HIS NAME IS
DORIAN SATOSHI NAKAMOTO,

1320
01:01:23,180 --> 01:01:24,949
LIVING IN CALIFORNIA,

1321
01:01:24,982 --> 01:01:26,717
BASICALLY HIDING
IN PLAIN SIGHT.

1322
01:01:26,751 --> 01:01:29,820
IT BECOMES A GIGANTIC
MEDIA SCRAMBLE,

1323
01:01:29,854 --> 01:01:31,956
AND THEN DORIAN EMERGES
FROM HIS HOUSE

1324
01:01:31,989 --> 01:01:34,424
LOOKING KIND OF DISHEVELED,
LOOKING KIND OF CONFUSED,

1325
01:01:34,458 --> 01:01:37,361
AND SAYS
HE'S NOT SATOSHI NAKAMOTO,

1326
01:01:37,394 --> 01:01:39,229
SAYS HE'S NEVER HEARD
OF BITCOIN.

1327
01:01:39,263 --> 01:01:41,065
HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND.
HE HAD ONE CONVERSATION
WITH LEAH.

1328
01:01:41,098 --> 01:01:42,266
SHE MISUNDERSTOOD
WHAT HE SAID,

1329
01:01:42,299 --> 01:01:45,069
SHE TOOK IT
THE WRONG WAY.

1330
01:01:45,102 --> 01:01:48,072
AND YOU PROBABLY WOULD HAVE
HAD TO HAVE BEEN
A CYPHERPUNK

1331
01:01:48,105 --> 01:01:49,840
TO UNDERSTAND ALL
THE ELEMENTS OF IT

1332
01:01:49,874 --> 01:01:51,375
THAT HAD ALREADY BEEN
PUT TOGETHER.

1333
01:01:51,408 --> 01:01:53,277
THE ODDS OF IT SEEMED
VERY LOW TO ME

1334
01:01:53,310 --> 01:01:55,846
THAT IT WAS SOMEBODY
FROM COMPLETELY OUTSIDE
THAT COMMUNITY

1335
01:01:55,880 --> 01:01:58,115
WHO HAPPENED TO KNOW
ALL THESE DIFFERENT THINGS

1336
01:01:58,148 --> 01:02:00,384
AND PUT THIS TOGETHER
AND APPEAR OUT OF NOWHERE.

1337
01:02:03,220 --> 01:02:05,422
[GREENBERG]
THE DAY THAT "NEWSWEEK'S"
STORY CAME OUT

1338
01:02:05,455 --> 01:02:07,992
NAMING DORIAN NAKAMOTO
AS THE CREATOR OF BITCOIN,

1339
01:02:08,025 --> 01:02:10,294
I GOT THIS EMAIL
FROM AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE

1340
01:02:10,327 --> 01:02:12,830
THAT WAS TITLED
"WHAT ARE THE ODDS?"

1341
01:02:12,863 --> 01:02:17,267
AND IT LAID OUT THE FACT
THAT HAL FINNEY

1342
01:02:17,301 --> 01:02:20,137
LIVES LESS THAN
TWO MILES AWAY FROM

1343
01:02:20,170 --> 01:02:22,172
THE KNOWN ADDRESS
OF DORIAN NAKAMOTO

1344
01:02:22,206 --> 01:02:24,008
WHERE "NEWSWEEK"
HAD FOUND HIM.

1345
01:02:24,041 --> 01:02:27,244
AND HAL FINNEY IS THE NUMBER TWO
EVER USER OF BITCOIN,

1346
01:02:27,277 --> 01:02:30,047
WHO RECEIVED THE FIRST
BITCOIN TRANSACTION.

1347
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:32,482
HE WORKED ON
AN EARLY PROTOTYPE

1348
01:02:32,516 --> 01:02:34,384
OF AN ANONYMOUS
CURRENCY SYSTEM.

1349
01:02:34,418 --> 01:02:36,153
HE WAS A CYPHERPUNK.

1350
01:02:38,355 --> 01:02:41,325
SO HOW COULD IT BE
THAT THE PURPORTED CREATOR
OF BITCOIN

1351
01:02:41,358 --> 01:02:44,929
AND THIS KNOWN, CONFIRMED,
SECOND-EVER USER OF BITCOIN,

1352
01:02:44,962 --> 01:02:46,430
HADN'T EVER COLLABORATED?

1353
01:02:46,463 --> 01:02:48,899
THAT HAL FINNEY, WHO WAS LESS
THAN TWO MILES AWAY

1354
01:02:48,933 --> 01:02:51,401
FROM DORIAN NAKAMOTO
HADN'T HELPED TO CREATE BITCOIN?

1355
01:02:51,435 --> 01:02:54,038
OR MAYBE HE REALLY WAS
THE CREATOR OF BITCOIN.

1356
01:02:54,071 --> 01:02:56,540
MAYBE HAL FINNEY
WAS SATOSHI NAKAMOTO.

1357
01:02:58,508 --> 01:03:00,945
[POPPER]
WHEN YOU LOOK AT
THE BITCOIN WHITE PAPER,

1358
01:03:00,978 --> 01:03:05,182
IT MADE REFERENCE TO
A LOT OF THE EARLIER PROJECTS

1359
01:03:05,215 --> 01:03:07,217
THAT FED INTO BITCOIN.

1360
01:03:07,251 --> 01:03:11,588
BUT IT'S VERY NOTABLE
THAT THE ONE PROJECT
IT DOESN'T REFER TO

1361
01:03:11,621 --> 01:03:13,290
IS NICK SZABO'S BIT GOLD,

1362
01:03:13,323 --> 01:03:15,292
WHICH IS PERHAPS
THE CLOSEST PRECEDENT

1363
01:03:15,325 --> 01:03:18,562
AND THE CLOSEST PARALLEL
TO BITCOIN.

1364
01:03:18,595 --> 01:03:20,397
[ANDRESEN]
I MEAN, BIT GOLD
IS SO CLOSE TO BITCOIN,

1365
01:03:20,430 --> 01:03:21,866
IT'S HARD NOT TO THINK

1366
01:03:21,899 --> 01:03:25,903
THAT, YOU KNOW,
MAYBE NICK IS SATOSHI.

1367
01:03:28,138 --> 01:03:31,141
[VIGNA]
A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL SAY
"NAKAMOTO MUST BE SZABO."

1368
01:03:31,175 --> 01:03:32,476
"NAKAMOTO
MUST HAVE BEEN FINNEY."

1369
01:03:32,509 --> 01:03:34,578
BUT I DON'T THINK
HE WAS TRYING TO LEAVE

1370
01:03:34,611 --> 01:03:37,281
ANY BREADCRUMBS OUT THERE
FOR ANYBODY TO FOLLOW.

1371
01:03:39,616 --> 01:03:41,185
[GREENBERG]
I TOLD MY EDITOR ABOUT IT.

1372
01:03:41,218 --> 01:03:43,888
HE AGREED THAT
"YOU FOUND SATOSHI NAKAMOTO."

1373
01:03:43,921 --> 01:03:46,056
SO I GOT ON A PLANE
TO SANTA BARBARA

1374
01:03:46,090 --> 01:03:48,625
AND I DROVE OUT
TO HAL FINNEY'S HOUSE.

1375
01:03:48,658 --> 01:03:51,428
BUT AT THIS STAGE,
HE WAS ALREADY

1376
01:03:51,461 --> 01:03:53,898
COMPLETELY PARALYZED
BY ALS,

1377
01:03:53,931 --> 01:03:57,968
THIS REALLY AWFUL,
DEBILITATING TERMINAL ILLNESS

1378
01:03:58,002 --> 01:04:00,537
THAT SLOWLY
SHUTS DOWN YOUR BODY

1379
01:04:00,570 --> 01:04:03,540
WHILE LEAVING YOUR MIND
COMPLETELY INTACT.

1380
01:04:03,573 --> 01:04:07,477
AND THE TIME WHEN
HE STARTED TO FADE IN
HIS PHYSICAL ABILITIES

1381
01:04:07,511 --> 01:04:09,213
DID ROUGHLY COINCIDE
WITH THE TIME

1382
01:04:09,246 --> 01:04:11,481
THAT SATOSHI NAKAMOTO
STARTED TO DISAPPEAR.

1383
01:04:11,515 --> 01:04:13,383
NOW MAYBE THE REASON
THAT SATOSHI NAKAMOTO

1384
01:04:13,417 --> 01:04:15,552
HAD CHOSEN TO FADE AWAY

1385
01:04:15,585 --> 01:04:18,555
WAS BECAUSE HAL FINNEY
WAS PHYSICALLY FADING.

1386
01:04:21,525 --> 01:04:25,162
[POPPER]
THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER
OF STYLOMETRIC STUDIES

1387
01:04:25,195 --> 01:04:28,132
AND YOU SEE SO MANY
OF THESE SIMILARITIES

1388
01:04:28,165 --> 01:04:30,901
BETWEEN SATOSHI'S WRITINGS
AND THOSE OF NICK'S,

1389
01:04:30,935 --> 01:04:33,570
INCLUDING THESE LITTLE THINGS
LIKE HAVING TWO SPACES

1390
01:04:33,603 --> 01:04:35,239
AT THE BEGINNING
OF A SENTENCE,

1391
01:04:35,272 --> 01:04:38,075
AND PHRASES AND SPELLINGS
THAT NOBODY ELSE USES.

1392
01:04:39,709 --> 01:04:43,280
[GREENBERG]
SO I TALKED TO HAL AS MUCH AS I
COULD, MOSTLY IN A KIND OF

1393
01:04:43,313 --> 01:04:49,453
ONE-WAY INTERVIEW BECAUSE HE
COULD REALLY ONLY RESPOND
WITH YES AND NO ANSWERS,

1394
01:04:49,486 --> 01:04:52,089
AND HE DENIED BEING
SATOSHI NAKAMOTO.

1395
01:04:52,122 --> 01:04:54,158
YOU COULD TELL
THAT HE WAS AMUSED
BY THE WHOLE IDEA

1396
01:04:54,191 --> 01:04:55,625
THAT I THOUGHT
HE WAS SATOSHI NAKAMOTO.

1397
01:04:55,659 --> 01:04:58,996
[POPPER]
ONE OF THE REALLY
REMARKABLE THINGS

1398
01:04:59,029 --> 01:05:00,264
FROM NICK SZABO'S WRITING

1399
01:05:00,297 --> 01:05:02,599
IN THOSE MONTHS
BEFORE BITCOIN

1400
01:05:02,632 --> 01:05:06,370
WAS PUBLICALLY LAUNCHED
IS THAT NICK,

1401
01:05:06,403 --> 01:05:08,438
IN RESPONDING
TO SOME COMMENTS

1402
01:05:08,472 --> 01:05:11,108
ABOUT A POST HE HAD MADE
ABOUT BIT GOLD,

1403
01:05:11,141 --> 01:05:14,278
ACTUALLY ASKED THE OTHER PEOPLE
WHO WERE READING HIM

1404
01:05:14,311 --> 01:05:18,348
IF ANYBODY WANTED TO HELP HIM
CODE THIS IDEA UP

1405
01:05:18,382 --> 01:05:21,018
INTO REAL SOFTWARE
THAT COULD WORK.

1406
01:05:21,051 --> 01:05:22,519
IT WAS NEVER TURNED
INTO A REALITY,

1407
01:05:22,552 --> 01:05:24,521
BUT WHEN YOU
LOOK AT BIT GOLD,

1408
01:05:24,554 --> 01:05:29,293
IT'S HARD NOT TO BE STRUCK
BY THE SIMILARITIES

1409
01:05:29,326 --> 01:05:32,362
BETWEEN IT AND BITCOIN.

1410
01:05:38,235 --> 01:05:40,137
IT'S POSSIBLE.

1411
01:05:40,170 --> 01:05:42,206
HAL COULD'VE
BEEN THE CODER.

1412
01:05:44,274 --> 01:05:46,043
I DON'T KNOW.

1413
01:05:46,076 --> 01:05:47,611
YOU KNOW, THIS IDEA THAT--
THAT HAL FINNEY COULD'VE BEEN

1414
01:05:47,644 --> 01:05:51,982
THE KIND OF GHOST CODER
FOR BITCOIN...

1415
01:05:52,016 --> 01:05:54,684
I GUESS IT'S POSSIBLE.

1416
01:05:54,718 --> 01:05:57,087
OTHER PEOPLE KIND OF
SPECULATING ON REDDIT

1417
01:05:57,121 --> 01:05:59,156
OR OTHER PARTS
OF THE INTERNET

1418
01:05:59,189 --> 01:06:01,325
THOUGHT THAT
MAYBE HAL FINNEY

1419
01:06:01,358 --> 01:06:04,261
HAD USED DORIAN NAKAMOTO
AS A PATSY.

1420
01:06:04,294 --> 01:06:07,264
IF HE WERE EVER TRACED
BACK TO DORIAN NAKAMOTO,

1421
01:06:07,297 --> 01:06:10,267
IT SEEMED LIKE THIS GUY
WAS THE CREATOR,

1422
01:06:10,300 --> 01:06:13,303
AND HAL FINNEY WOULD BE
SORT OF IMMUNIZED FROM IT.

1423
01:06:13,337 --> 01:06:17,241
EVERYONE ELSE WHO WAS
INVOLVED IN THE PROJECTS

1424
01:06:17,274 --> 01:06:19,676
LEADING UP TO BITCOIN
HAS RELEASED

1425
01:06:19,709 --> 01:06:23,680
THEIR COMMUNICATIONS
WITH SATOSHI FROM THIS PERIOD.

1426
01:06:23,713 --> 01:06:25,682
NICK HAS AVOIDED
DOING THAT,

1427
01:06:25,715 --> 01:06:28,552
AND ESSENTIALLY WENT SILENT
IN THOSE CRITICAL MONTHS

1428
01:06:28,585 --> 01:06:30,620
AFTER BITCOIN WAS RELEASED.

1429
01:06:30,654 --> 01:06:33,390
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU TALK
TO PEOPLE FACE TO FACE,

1430
01:06:33,423 --> 01:06:35,459
AND THEY TELL YOU
THESE THINGS,

1431
01:06:35,492 --> 01:06:39,463
YOU CAN GET A SENSE
IF THEY'RE BEING HONEST.

1432
01:06:39,496 --> 01:06:42,066
IF HAL FINNEY ACTUALLY
HAD A SECRET

1433
01:06:42,099 --> 01:06:44,168
BILLION-DOLLAR CACHE
OF BITCOINS,

1434
01:06:44,201 --> 01:06:47,104
HE WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ABLE
TO LIE TO ME SO EFFECTIVELY
ABOUT IT.

1435
01:06:47,137 --> 01:06:50,774
IN THE END, THE REASONS
TO BELIEVE THAT THIS WAS
ALL JUST A COINCIDENCE

1436
01:06:50,807 --> 01:06:54,478
BEGAN TO OUTWEIGH
THE COINCIDENCE ITSELF.

1437
01:06:54,511 --> 01:06:55,745
IT'S ALMOST LIKE AN EEL.

1438
01:06:55,779 --> 01:06:58,082
THERE'S SOMETHING THERE,
YOU CAN SEE IT,

1439
01:06:58,115 --> 01:07:00,350
BUT AS SOON AS YOU TOUCH IT
IT JUST SLIDES RIGHT OUT
OF YOUR HANDS

1440
01:07:00,384 --> 01:07:01,718
AND YOU'RE LEFT
WITH NOTHING.

1441
01:07:02,852 --> 01:07:04,754
ANYBODY WHO IS
OF ANY NOTE

1442
01:07:04,788 --> 01:07:06,156
IN THE CYPHERPUNK
MOVEMENT,

1443
01:07:06,190 --> 01:07:07,191
AND EVEN OUTSIDE
OF IT TOO,

1444
01:07:07,224 --> 01:07:09,093
HAS AT ONE TIME
OR ANOTHER

1445
01:07:09,126 --> 01:07:10,494
BEEN CALLED SATOSHI.

1446
01:07:10,527 --> 01:07:12,562
HAL FINNEY DENIED IT.
NICK SZABO DENIED IT.

1447
01:07:12,596 --> 01:07:13,830
THEY'VE ALL DENIED IT.

1448
01:07:13,863 --> 01:07:15,832
MAYBE ONE OF THEM
IS SATOSHI.

1449
01:07:15,865 --> 01:07:17,634
MAYBE ALL OF THEM
ARE SATOSHI.

1450
01:07:17,667 --> 01:07:19,669
IT REALLY IS A MYSTERY.

1451
01:07:55,372 --> 01:07:57,741
THAT'S THE ORIGINAL TICKER

1452
01:07:57,774 --> 01:08:00,410
FROM NEXT DOOR.

1453
01:08:00,444 --> 01:08:02,546
ALL RIGHT,
SO WE'RE OVER HERE.

1454
01:08:02,579 --> 01:08:06,316
BITCOIN CENTER, 100 FEET FROM
THE STOCK EXCHANGE, OVER HERE.

1455
01:08:06,350 --> 01:08:09,153
AND, UH...

1456
01:08:09,186 --> 01:08:11,188
YOU KNOW, SOME OF YOU GUYS
TOOK A HIT LAST WEEK,

1457
01:08:11,221 --> 01:08:14,658
LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS.

1458
01:08:14,691 --> 01:08:16,226
LOT OF THE BIG GUYS,

1459
01:08:16,260 --> 01:08:20,564
THEY GOT THEIR FOOTHOLD
IN THE BUSINESS

1460
01:08:20,597 --> 01:08:24,134
THAT THEY WEREN'T A PART OF
IN THE BEGINNING.

1461
01:08:26,636 --> 01:08:28,305
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON.

1462
01:08:28,338 --> 01:08:30,374
BUT, UH, I DON'T KNOW.

1463
01:08:30,407 --> 01:08:32,176
I WOULDN'T WRITE OFF
BITCOIN THAT EASY.

1464
01:08:32,209 --> 01:08:34,544
I KNOW THAT BITCOIN
IS GONNA CHANGE THE WORLD.

1465
01:08:34,578 --> 01:08:36,446
IT'S CHANGING
THE WORLD ALREADY.

1466
01:08:36,480 --> 01:08:39,649
AND WE HAVE
TO STAND TALL

1467
01:08:39,683 --> 01:08:42,919
AND PROUD

1468
01:08:42,952 --> 01:08:45,789
AS BITCOINERS
AND EARLY ADOPTERS.

1469
01:08:45,822 --> 01:08:48,225
THEY DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT NEW TECHNOLOGY,

1470
01:08:48,258 --> 01:08:52,396
BUT ONCE
IT STARTS MAKING SENSE,

1471
01:08:52,429 --> 01:08:53,797
THEY THROW THEIR DOLLARS
BEHIND IT.

1472
01:09:00,937 --> 01:09:03,240
[WINTER]
YOU KNOW, UNFORTUNATELY,

1473
01:09:06,343 --> 01:09:09,679
EARLY ADOPTERS

1474
01:09:09,713 --> 01:09:13,683
MAKE THE ROADS
THAT WE ALL TRAVEL DOWN,

1475
01:09:13,717 --> 01:09:17,287
AND THEY ARE USUALLY PAVED OVER
IN THE PROCESS.

1476
01:09:17,321 --> 01:09:20,257
THE FIRST GUY
THROUGH THE DOOR GETS SHOT.

1477
01:09:20,290 --> 01:09:22,292
YOU KNOW, BUT SOMEBODY'S
GOTTA GO THROUGH THE DOOR,

1478
01:09:22,326 --> 01:09:24,594
BUT THEY'RE GONNA GET SHOT.

1479
01:09:24,628 --> 01:09:26,830
CHARLIE SHREM,
ROSS ALBRICHT,

1480
01:09:26,863 --> 01:09:28,532
JULIAN ASSANGE,

1481
01:09:28,565 --> 01:09:31,468
THEY GOT SHOT
COMING THROUGH THE DOOR.

1482
01:09:31,501 --> 01:09:35,905
BUT WE'RE ALL UTILIZING
THE FREEDOMS

1483
01:09:35,939 --> 01:09:38,408
AND TECHNOLOGIES
AFFORDED TO US

1484
01:09:38,442 --> 01:09:39,843
BECAUSE THEY KNOCKED
THE DOOR DOWN.

1485
01:09:41,911 --> 01:09:43,547
[ELIZABETH]
HEY, MICHAEL.

1486
01:09:43,580 --> 01:09:45,715
CAN I PUT YOU
ON SPEAKERPHONE
FOR A MINUTE?

1487
01:09:45,749 --> 01:09:48,352
IF I KNOW HOW.

1488
01:09:48,385 --> 01:09:51,755
HEY, MICHAEL, CAN I ASK YOU,
WHERE DID YOU BUY BITCOINS?

1489
01:09:53,523 --> 01:09:54,658
YEAH.

1490
01:09:58,295 --> 01:10:00,497
DID YOU LOSE-- HOW MUCH--
DO YOU STILL HAVE THEM?

1491
01:10:05,402 --> 01:10:06,436
YOU PUT INTO IT.

1492
01:10:06,470 --> 01:10:08,305
CAN YOU USE IT?

1493
01:10:08,338 --> 01:10:11,508
DO I WANT TO BUY IT?
NO, NOT TODAY.

1494
01:10:11,541 --> 01:10:13,677
THOUGH IT IS GOING
TO BE AROUND.

1495
01:10:16,646 --> 01:10:19,549
DID YOU EVER USE IT
TO BUY ANYTHING?

1496
01:10:22,652 --> 01:10:25,221
-MICHAEL.
-[LAUGHTER]

1497
01:10:27,824 --> 01:10:28,958
NO, OKAY.

1498
01:10:28,992 --> 01:10:31,828
THEY SHOULD GO BACK TO,
YOU KNOW,

1499
01:10:31,861 --> 01:10:33,963
DAY ONE AND
JUST START ALL OVER.

1500
01:10:33,997 --> 01:10:36,733
FORGET ABOUT BITCOIN,
CALL IT SOMETHING ELSE.

1501
01:10:36,766 --> 01:10:39,436
I THINK IT'S BEEN
SO TARNISHED NOW

1502
01:10:39,469 --> 01:10:42,439
WITH THIS--
WITH THE SILK ROAD...

1503
01:10:44,808 --> 01:10:47,477
YOU KNOW, I JUST THINK,
YOU KNOW,

1504
01:10:47,511 --> 01:10:51,047
THAT ALL THAT STUFF ABOUT
$400 MILLION DISAPPEARING

1505
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:55,285
AND... YOU'RE JUST NOT
GONNA GET OFF THE GROUND.

1506
01:10:55,319 --> 01:10:56,753
NOBODY'S GONNA--

1507
01:10:56,786 --> 01:10:57,887
YOU KNOW,
LIKE WARREN BUFFET SAID,

1508
01:10:57,921 --> 01:10:59,389
"STAY THE HELL AWAY FROM IT."

1509
01:11:03,427 --> 01:11:05,295
[LAWSKY]
TO PUT ALL THE CARDS
ON THE TABLE,

1510
01:11:05,329 --> 01:11:07,697
I'M GONNA BE
LEAVING THE DEPARTMENT
IN THE COMING WEEKS.

1511
01:11:07,731 --> 01:11:12,336
AND IF YOU ASKED ME
BACK WHEN I TOOK THIS JOB
IN 2011

1512
01:11:12,369 --> 01:11:16,606
WHAT I THOUGHT
WE'D BE WORKING ON
DURING MY TENURE,

1513
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:19,843
DIGITAL CURRENCIES
WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN
AT THE TOP OF THE LIST.

1514
01:11:26,783 --> 01:11:28,752
[VOORHEES]
SO BEN LAWSKY CREATED
THIS THING CALL THE BITLICENSE

1515
01:11:28,785 --> 01:11:32,656
WHICH IS NEW YORK'S
ATTEMPT TO REGULATE

1516
01:11:32,689 --> 01:11:35,592
THIS SCARY NEW TECHNOLOGY.
IT'S NOW LAW.

1517
01:11:35,625 --> 01:11:39,095
AND HE HAS ANNOUNCED
THAT HE IS LEAVING GOVERNMENT

1518
01:11:39,128 --> 01:11:42,699
IN ORDER TO SET UP HIS OWN
PRIVATE CONSULTING FIRM

1519
01:11:42,732 --> 01:11:46,636
TO HELP COMPANIES NAVIGATE
FINANCIAL REGULATIONS

1520
01:11:46,670 --> 01:11:48,938
SUCH AS THE BITLICENSE
THAT HE CREATED.

1521
01:11:48,972 --> 01:11:52,642
SO WE ESSENTIALLY HAD THIS
BEAUTIFUL NEW ECOSYSTEM
BEING BUILT,

1522
01:11:52,676 --> 01:11:55,345
AND BEN LAWSKY COMES BY,

1523
01:11:55,379 --> 01:11:56,646
SAYS, "I'M HERE
TO PROTECT CONSUMERS."

1524
01:11:56,680 --> 01:11:58,014
HE BUILDS A HUGE
WALL AROUND THE THING,

1525
01:11:58,047 --> 01:11:59,115
AND THEN HE SITS
OUTSIDE THE GATE

1526
01:11:59,148 --> 01:12:01,117
CHARGING PEOPLE
TO GET IN.

1527
01:12:01,150 --> 01:12:03,753
THIS IS THE VERY DEFINITION
OF CRONY CAPITALISM,

1528
01:12:03,787 --> 01:12:06,356
AND, FOR SOME REASON,

1529
01:12:06,390 --> 01:12:08,024
BEN LAWSKY DOESN'T EVEN SEE
ANYTHING WRONG WITH THAT.

1530
01:12:10,026 --> 01:12:11,761
I THINK HISTORY
WILL NOT JUDGE HIM

1531
01:12:11,795 --> 01:12:13,863
AS FAVORABLY AS HE THINKS.

1532
01:12:16,165 --> 01:12:17,667
SO, UM, YEAH.

1533
01:12:17,701 --> 01:12:21,037
I'VE STARTED UP
MY OWN CONSULTING BUSINESS.

1534
01:12:21,070 --> 01:12:22,606
IT'S BEEN
QUITE INTERESTING.

1535
01:12:22,639 --> 01:12:24,541
DOING A LOT OF WORK
IN THE FINTECH SPACE,

1536
01:12:24,574 --> 01:12:27,811
BUT ALSO DOING WORK
WITH A LOT OF TRADITIONAL
COMPANIES

1537
01:12:27,844 --> 01:12:30,013
IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES
WORLD AS WELL.

01:12:30,046 --> 01:12:34,083
[POPPER]
BEN LAWSKY'S TEAM
AT THE DFS

1539
01:12:34,117 --> 01:12:37,387
THAT WAS WORKING ON
THIS BITLICENSE

1540
01:12:37,421 --> 01:12:38,688
AND THE BITCOIN INITIATIVE

1541
01:12:38,722 --> 01:12:41,024
HAVE ALL ENDED UP
LEAVING THE AGENCY

1542
01:12:41,057 --> 01:12:42,792
AND GOING
TO CONSULTING FIRMS

1543
01:12:42,826 --> 01:12:45,895
THAT ARE NOW WORKING
ON THESE ISSUES.

1544
01:12:45,929 --> 01:12:50,700
DANNY ALTER IS GOING
TO WORK FOR ITBIT

1545
01:12:50,734 --> 01:12:52,869
AND DANA SYRACUSE
IS GOING TO WORK FOR

1546
01:12:52,902 --> 01:12:54,638
THE CONSULTING FIRM K2.

1547
01:12:54,671 --> 01:12:56,640
ITBIT IS
PARTICULARLY NOTABLE

1548
01:12:56,673 --> 01:12:59,943
BECAUSE THEY WERE
THE FIRST TO FIND A WAY

1549
01:12:59,976 --> 01:13:03,112
TO PARTNER WITH THE DFS
TO GET LICENSED

1550
01:13:03,146 --> 01:13:05,682
TO OPEN THEIR OWN
BITCOIN EXCHANGE.

1551
01:13:10,219 --> 01:13:11,821
[SHREM]
WHEN THIS IS OVER,

1552
01:13:11,855 --> 01:13:14,491
DEFINITELY GOING TO LEAVE
NEW YORK WHEN I CAN.

1553
01:13:14,524 --> 01:13:16,092
WHERE I'M GONNA GO,
I DON'T KNOW.

1554
01:13:16,125 --> 01:13:18,562
I THINK THE BITCOIN COMMUNITY
IN NEW YORK IS DONE WITH.

1555
01:13:18,595 --> 01:13:20,129
NO, IT DOESN'T FOSTER
INNOVATION HERE.

1556
01:13:20,163 --> 01:13:21,765
IT'S TOO DIFFICULT
TO HAVE A BITCOIN COMPANY.

1557
01:13:21,798 --> 01:13:22,999
NO BANKS WILL
OPEN UP ACCOUNTS.

1558
01:13:23,032 --> 01:13:24,934
YOU HAVE THE THREAT
OF REGULATION,

1559
01:13:24,968 --> 01:13:26,069
AND YOUR HIGH-PROFILE
ARRESTS

1560
01:13:26,102 --> 01:13:27,170
LIKE MYSELF AND OTHERS.

1561
01:13:27,203 --> 01:13:29,973
NO ONE WANTS
TO DEAL WITH IT.

1562
01:13:30,006 --> 01:13:31,941
WHEN DID YOU FIRST
START DIGGING IN ON BITCOIN?

1563
01:13:31,975 --> 01:13:33,777
TWO, TWO AND HALF
YEARS AGO,

1564
01:13:33,810 --> 01:13:35,779
WHEN I TOOK OVER
THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE

1565
01:13:35,812 --> 01:13:38,014
- AT JP MORGAN.
- SO YOU PROBABLY
HAD YOUR MT. GOX,

CHARLIE AND THOSE GUYS.

1567
01:13:40,684 --> 01:13:43,553
IT'S INTERESTING,
ALMOST NONE OF THOSE GUYS
ARE AROUND ANYMORE.

1568
01:13:43,587 --> 01:13:45,221
TWO YEARS AGO
AT ALL THE MAJOR BANKS,

1569
01:13:45,254 --> 01:13:46,490
BITCOIN WAS
AN AFTERTHOUGHT.

1570
01:13:46,523 --> 01:13:48,858
IT WAS KIND OF A--
MAYBE IN A HALLWAY
KIND OF CONVERSATION

1571
01:13:48,892 --> 01:13:50,727
AT THE WATER COOLER
AND NOW,

1572
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:53,029
YOU KNOW, EVEN THIS WEEK,
I MET WITH ONE OF THE OTHER
MAJOR BANKS.

1573
01:13:53,062 --> 01:13:57,100
EVERYONE'S GOT
A BITCOIN SPECIALIST,
AT LEAST ONE WORKING GROUP.

1574
01:13:57,133 --> 01:13:59,102
KIND OF TEAMS OF PEOPLE
WHO ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

1575
01:13:59,135 --> 01:14:01,638
HOW TO INCORPORATE
THE TECHNOLOGY

1576
01:14:01,671 --> 01:14:04,774
INTO THEIR
EXISTING OPERATION.

1579
01:14:08,211 --> 01:14:10,614
ARE REALLY STARTING
TO RECOGNIZE

1580
01:14:10,647 --> 01:14:13,249
THAT THE PAYMENT SYSTEM
UNDERLYING BANKING

1581
01:14:13,282 --> 01:14:14,884
COULD BE MADE
MORE EFFICIENT

1582
01:14:14,918 --> 01:14:17,621
BY THE APPLICATION
OF BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGIES.

1583
01:14:18,822 --> 01:14:20,924
[LAWSKY]
THE BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY

1584
01:14:20,957 --> 01:14:22,792
UNDERLYING BITCOIN

1585
01:14:22,826 --> 01:14:24,728
HAS BECOME SOMETHING THAT

1586
01:14:24,761 --> 01:14:27,631
A LOT PEOPLE ARE NOW
VERY, VERY INTERESTED IN

1587
01:14:27,664 --> 01:14:29,666
FOR ALL KINDS OF
OTHER USES,

1588
01:14:29,699 --> 01:14:33,169
WHETHER IT'S ALLOWING
FOR DERIVATIVES
TO BE TRANSFERRED

1589
01:14:33,202 --> 01:14:35,004
OR SECURITIES
TO BE TRANSFERRED,

1590
01:14:35,038 --> 01:14:38,908
OR ALL MANNER OF FINANCIAL
INSTRUMENTS TO BE TRANSFERRED

IN COMPLEX,
INTERESTING WAYS.

1592
01:14:40,243 --> 01:14:41,811
I THINK DIFFERENT COMPANIES

1593
01:14:41,845 --> 01:14:43,847
ARE GOING TO ADOPT
DIFFERENT STRATEGIES.

1594
01:14:43,880 --> 01:14:46,015
AND IT'S GONNA BE
FASCINATING TO WATCH

1595
01:14:46,049 --> 01:14:48,017
COMPANIES LIKE
DIGITAL ASSET HOLDINGS,

VERY INTERESTING WORK.

01:14:55,324 --> 01:14:57,627
[BLYTHE MASTERS]
I DIDN'T BECOME
AWARE OF BITCOIN

1599
01:14:57,661 --> 01:15:01,765
IN ANY MEANINGFUL SENSE
UNTIL 2014,

1600
01:15:01,798 --> 01:15:04,167
LATE IN THE YEAR,
AND AT THE TIME,

1601
01:15:04,200 --> 01:15:08,672
MY PERSPECTIVE WAS ONE
OF SKEPTICISM, I WOULD SAY.

1602
01:15:08,705 --> 01:15:12,241
SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE
THE STORYLINE THAT I HEARD

1603
01:15:12,275 --> 01:15:15,579
RELATED VERY MUCH
TO CRYPTOCURRENCY

1604
01:15:15,612 --> 01:15:18,682
AS A POTENTIAL MEDIUM
OF EXCHANGE AND STORE OF VALUE,

1605
01:15:18,715 --> 01:15:22,051
WHICH IS A VALID DEBATE
AND APPLICATION,

1606
01:15:22,085 --> 01:15:26,255
BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE
FULL EXTENT OF THE POWER

1607
01:15:26,289 --> 01:15:29,993
THAT THE UNDERLYING TECHNOLOGY
HAS TO ACHIEVE.

1608
01:15:31,227 --> 01:15:34,297
BLYTHE MASTERS
IS NOT JUST ANY BANKER.

1609
01:15:34,330 --> 01:15:38,735
SHE IS THIS PERSON
WHO I THINK IS REALLY SEEN

1610
01:15:38,768 --> 01:15:42,305
AS BEING BEHIND
SOME OF THE MOST
PROBLEMATIC INNOVATIONS

1611
01:15:42,338 --> 01:15:45,909
IN THE FINANCIAL INDUSTRY
OVER THE LAST THREE DECADES.

BLYTHE IS THE ONE WHO'S
ESSENTIALLY GIVEN CREDIT

1613
01:15:48,377 --> 01:15:51,214
FOR CREATING
THE CREDIT DEFAULT SWAP

1614
01:15:51,247 --> 01:15:56,019
WHICH ESSENTIALLY
PROVIDES A WAY TO BET
ON THE DEFAULT OF A BOND,

1615
01:15:56,052 --> 01:15:59,923
AND THE CREDIT DEFAULT SWAP
ENDED UP TAKING THIS PLACE

1616
01:15:59,956 --> 01:16:02,125
AT THE CENTER
OF THE FINANCIAL CRISIS

1617
01:16:02,158 --> 01:16:04,594
AND THESE BETS
THAT BANKS HAD MADE

1618
01:16:04,628 --> 01:16:07,030
AGAINST SUB-PRIME
MORTGAGES.

1619
01:16:08,364 --> 01:16:11,134
BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY
ERADICATES

1620
01:16:11,167 --> 01:16:13,870
A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT
OF INEFFICIENCY IN THE SYSTEM,

1621
01:16:13,903 --> 01:16:15,805
AND REDUCES COSTS.

1622
01:16:15,839 --> 01:16:18,307
IT DOESN'T MEAN
THAT WE ARE DOING AWAY

1623
01:16:18,341 --> 01:16:21,678
WITH THE NEED FOR TRUST
IN FINANCIAL SERVICES AT ALL.

TO FIND A WAY

TO CIRCUMVENT WALL STREET,

1626
01:16:27,784 --> 01:16:30,053
AND WHAT BLYTHE MASTERS
IS DOING

1627
01:16:30,086 --> 01:16:32,255
IS ESSENTIALLY
TRYING TO FIND WAYS

1628
01:16:32,288 --> 01:16:35,625
TO BRING WALL STREET
INTO BITCOIN

1629
01:16:35,659 --> 01:16:38,928
AND MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR THEM
TO USE THIS TECHNOLOGY
AS WELL.

1630
01:16:38,962 --> 01:16:41,965
WHAT THE BANKERS SEEM TO BE
LOOKING TO DO AT THIS POINT

1631
01:16:41,998 --> 01:16:45,735
IS CREATE THEIR OWN
PRIVATE BLOCKCHAIN,

1632
01:16:45,769 --> 01:16:48,104
WHERE THEIR COMPUTERS
ARE POWERING IT.

1633

RATHER THAN
THESE ANONYMOUS MINERS,

1634
01:16:50,807 --> 01:16:53,342
THEY WANT CONTROL
OVER THE SYSTEM.

1635
01:16:53,376 --> 01:16:58,414
THE BANKS ARE LOOKING
AT THIS INCREDIBLY WIDE ARRAY

1636
01:16:58,447 --> 01:17:01,084
OF WAYS THAT
THEY MIGHT USE THIS,

1637
01:17:01,117 --> 01:17:04,654
WHICH INCLUDE REPLACING
STOCK EXCHANGES,

1638
01:17:04,688 --> 01:17:08,057
FINDING NEW WAYS
TO ORIGINATE LOANS,

1639
01:17:08,091 --> 01:17:12,428
FINDING NEW WAYS TO MOVE MONEY
BETWEEN COUNTRIES,

1640
01:17:12,461 --> 01:17:14,063
AND, OF COURSE,
THAT'S GOING BACK

1641
01:17:14,097 --> 01:17:17,100
TO THE ORIGINAL IDEA
OF BITCOIN,

1642
01:17:17,133 --> 01:17:20,670
BUT NOW IT'S HAPPENING WITHIN
THESE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS

1643
01:17:20,704 --> 01:17:24,040
RATHER THAN OUTSIDE IT,
AS BITCOIN HAD IMAGINED.

1644
01:17:25,842 --> 01:17:28,011
[VOORHEES]
I HAVE NO PROBLEM
WITH THE BANKING SYSTEM

1645
01:17:28,044 --> 01:17:29,946
AND THE FINANCIAL INDUSTRY
CO-OPTING BITCOIN,

1646
01:17:29,979 --> 01:17:33,049
PRIMARILY BECAUSE BITCOIN
CAN'T REALLY BE CO-OPTED.

1647
01:17:33,082 --> 01:17:34,283
THE FACT
THAT IT'S DECENTRALIZED

1648
01:17:34,317 --> 01:17:35,985
MEANS NO ONE
CAN CONTROL IT,

1649
01:17:36,019 --> 01:17:39,756
NO MATTER WHO THEY ARE
OR HOW MUCH MONEY THEY HAVE.

1650
01:17:39,789 --> 01:17:41,224
[ANDRESEN]
I THINK IT'S
ALL GOOD FOR BITCOIN.

1651
01:17:41,257 --> 01:17:42,792
I THINK ALL OF THE INNOVATION
THAT'S HAPPENING,

1652
01:17:42,826 --> 01:17:45,061
BOTH ON WALL STREET
AND IN SILICON VALLEY

1653
01:17:45,094 --> 01:17:47,063
I THINK COMPETITION
WILL TAKE CARE OF

1654
01:17:47,096 --> 01:17:49,032
PEOPLE WHO WANT TO TRY
TO HAVE A MONOPOLY,

1655
01:17:49,065 --> 01:17:53,036
OR WHO WANT TO TRY TO CHARGE
MORE THAN THEY SHOULD

1656
01:17:53,069 --> 01:17:54,303
FOR WHATEVER
PRODUCT OR SERVICE

1657
01:17:54,337 --> 01:17:56,172
THAT IS HAPPENING
ON THE BLOCKCHAIN.

1658
01:17:56,205 --> 01:17:58,007
IT REALLY IS
AS ADVERTISED.

1659
01:17:58,041 --> 01:18:00,877
IT REALLY IS CONTROLLED BY ALL
THE PEOPLE WHO ARE USING IT,

1660
01:18:00,910 --> 01:18:04,781
AND IT REALLY IS DESIGNED
JUST TO BE A MORE EFFICIENT,

1661
01:18:04,814 --> 01:18:08,317
MORE FAIR WAY OF SENDING
VALUE OVER THE INTERNET.

1662
01:18:10,019 --> 01:18:12,088
[WINTER]
BITCOIN IS NOT NEUTRAL.

1663
01:18:12,121 --> 01:18:16,092
YOU CANNOT REMOVE
THE POLITICAL COMPONENT

1664
01:18:16,125 --> 01:18:19,062
THAT SATOSHI IMPLANTED
IN BITCOIN FROM BITCOIN.

1665
01:18:19,095 --> 01:18:20,429
THAT'S WHAT
A LOT OF THE PEOPLE

1666
01:18:20,463 --> 01:18:22,331
ON THE WALL STREET SIDE
TRY TO DO.

1667
01:18:22,365 --> 01:18:25,368
YOU CANNOT NEUTRALIZE
BITCOIN.

1668
01:18:25,401 --> 01:18:26,702
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

1669
01:18:30,206 --> 01:18:33,176
[SHREM]
THANKFULLY, I'M GONNA GO TO
A COMFY FEDERAL PRISON CAMP

1670
01:18:33,209 --> 01:18:35,879
WITHOUT FENCES, THAT HAS
POOL TABLES AND A TRACK,

1671
01:18:35,912 --> 01:18:38,514
AND BASEBALL FIELD
AND DECENT FOOD,

1672
01:18:38,547 --> 01:18:42,852
AND KIND OF
100 TO 200 PEOPLE
THAT ARE WHITE COLLAR.

1673
01:18:42,886 --> 01:18:46,856
THOSE GUYS IN PRISON
ARE THE BEST ONES
TO USE BITCOIN.

1674
01:18:46,890 --> 01:18:48,792
THEY'RE SMART.
I'M VERY EXCITED

1675
01:18:48,825 --> 01:18:50,193
TO TALK TO THEM ABOUT IT.

1676
01:19:09,846 --> 01:19:12,849
[VIGNA]
SO YES, THE VCS ARE
DRIVING THIS THING RIGHT NOW.

1677
01:19:12,882 --> 01:19:14,217
THEY'RE POURING
MONEY INTO IT.

1678
01:19:14,250 --> 01:19:16,820
THEY'RE BUILDING THESE
FOR-PROFIT COMPANIES

1679
01:19:16,853 --> 01:19:19,522
PEOPLE WHO HAVE A BACKGROUND
OUTSIDE OF BITCOIN

1680
01:19:19,555 --> 01:19:21,991
SEEING THE VALUE OF IT
AND COMING TO IT.

1681
01:19:22,025 --> 01:19:25,528
BUT JUST BECAUSE THEY'RE DOING
EVERYTHING THEY'RE DOING

1682
01:19:25,561 --> 01:19:28,397
DOESN'T MEAN
THAT THE LIBERTARIANS
AND THE UTOPIANS

1683
01:19:28,431 --> 01:19:29,899
HAVE TO GO AWAY.

1684
01:19:29,933 --> 01:19:31,200
BITCOIN IS OPEN SOURCE.

1685
01:19:31,234 --> 01:19:32,836
YOU CAN DO WHATEVER
YOU WANT WITH IT.

1686
01:19:32,869 --> 01:19:34,070
SO THEY'RE STILL THERE.

1687
01:19:34,103 --> 01:19:35,404
THEY'RE STILL BUILDING
THEIR PRODUCTS.

1688
01:19:35,438 --> 01:19:36,940
THEY'RE STILL BUILDING
THEIR VISION.

1689
01:19:36,973 --> 01:19:38,875
AND IF BITCOIN
GOES MAINSTREAM

1690
01:19:38,908 --> 01:19:40,176
AND IF IT GETS PICKED UP,

1691
01:19:40,209 --> 01:19:41,945
EVEN IF IT'S RUNNING
IN THE BACKGROUND,

1692
01:19:41,978 --> 01:19:44,213
THERE ARE GOING
TO BE ELEMENTS OF THAT

1693
01:19:44,247 --> 01:19:46,549
AND THAT'S KIND OF WHAT
UTOPIA MOVEMENTS ALWAYS ARE.

1694
01:19:46,582 --> 01:19:49,552
THE THING THAT THE UTOPIANS
WERE DREAMING ABOUT

1695
01:19:49,585 --> 01:19:51,955
IS NOT GONNA HAPPEN
THE WAY THEY EXPECTED IT,

1696
01:19:51,988 --> 01:19:54,190
BUT I DO THINK IT
IS GOING TO FILTER THROUGH

1697
01:19:54,223 --> 01:19:56,893
AND YOU ARE GONNA SEE IT.
YOU'RE GONNA SEE IT.

1698
01:20:06,202 --> 01:20:10,073
SO YOU'RE GONNA SHOW ME
THAT SATOSHI NAKAMOTO IS YOU.

1699
01:20:11,374 --> 01:20:13,843
YES.

1700
01:20:13,877 --> 01:20:16,345
SOME PEOPLE WILL BELIEVE,
SOME PEOPLE WON'T.

1701
01:20:16,379 --> 01:20:19,883
AND TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH,
I DON'T REALLY CARE.

1702
01:20:19,916 --> 01:20:22,418
BUT YOU CAN SAY,
HAND ON HEART TO ME,

1703
01:20:22,451 --> 01:20:25,121
"I AM SATOSHI NAKAMOTO."

1704
01:20:25,154 --> 01:20:28,157
I WAS THE MAIN PART OF IT.
OTHER PEOPLE HELPED ME.

1705
01:20:28,191 --> 01:20:32,395
I'M GOING TO COME IN FRONT
OF THAT CAMERA ONCE,

1706
01:20:32,428 --> 01:20:34,630
AND I WILL NEVER

1707
01:20:34,663 --> 01:20:36,900
EVER BE ON A CAMERA
EVER AGAIN

1708
01:20:36,933 --> 01:20:39,002
FOR ANY TV STATION

1709
01:20:39,035 --> 01:20:41,470
OR ANY MEDIA EVER.
