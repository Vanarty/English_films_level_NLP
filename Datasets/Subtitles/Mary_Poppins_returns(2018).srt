1
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,607
<i>When the early
morning hours</i>

2
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,921
<i>Have come and gone</i>

3
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,647
<i>Through the misty
morning showers</i>

4
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:17,206
<i>I greet the dawn</i>

5
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,840
<i>For when its light
has hit the ground</i>

6
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,002
<i>There's lots of treasures
to be found</i>

7
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,690
<i>Underneath
the lovely London sky</i>

8
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,921
<i>Though the lamps
I'm turning down</i>

9
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,526
<i>Please don't feel blue</i>

10
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,887
<i>For in this part
of London town</i>

11
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,526
<i>The light shines through</i>

12
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,967
<i>Don't believe
the things you've read</i>

13
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,247
<i>You never know
what's up ahead</i>

14
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:57,009
<i>Underneath the lovely
London sky</i>

15
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,687
<i>Have a pot of tea</i>

16
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,649
<i>Mend your broken cup</i>

17
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,728
<i>There's a different
point of view awaiting you</i>

18
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,723
<i>If you would just look up</i>

19
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,404
- Get out of here!
- I know.

20
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,771
<i>Yesterday you had to borrow
from your chums</i>

21
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:26,482
<i>Seems the promise
of tomorrow never comes</i>

22
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,246
<i>But since you dreamed
the night away</i>

23
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,607
<i>Tomorrow's here,
it's called today</i>

24
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:35,970
<i>So count your blessings
You're a lucky guy</i>

25
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:42,366
<i>For you're underneath
the lovely London sky</i>

26
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,561
Morning, Jack.

27
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:38,611
Admiral above decks!

28
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,250
<i>Listen</i>

29
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:46,371
<i>Soon the slump will
disappear, it won't be long</i>

30
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,648
<i>Sooner than you think
you'll hear</i>

31
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,451
<i>Some bright new song</i>

32
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,365
You're all right, children?

33
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,082
<i>So hold on tight
to those you love</i>

34
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:59,005
<i>And maybe soon
from up above</i>

35
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:03,290
<i>You'll be blessed,
so keep on looking high</i>

36
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:10,289
<i>While you're underneath
the lovely London sky</i>

37
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:20,282
<i>Lovely London sky</i>

38
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,206
Great steaming clams!
They've done it again!

39
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,126
Those blundering blowfish
have rung Big Ben too soon!

40
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,851
Storm clouds.
On the horizon, sir.

41
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,162
Heading straight
for Cherry Tree Lane.

42
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:04,051
Batten down the hatches,
Mr. Binnacle!

43
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:07,045
Rough seas ahead, I fear!

44
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,526
Michael!

45
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,326
Jane!

46
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,845
What is it, Ellen?

47
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,048
The bloody sink's exploded!

48
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,770
- Dear.
- Not again!

49
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,251
Annabel! John!

50
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,323
We heard, Aunt Jane!
I'll ring the plumbers!

51
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,686
I'll turn off the water
at the mains.

52
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,086
Yes, thank you,
darlings.

53
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,969
Ellen, fetch us a mop and towels, will you?

54
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,043
I told him
to get them pipes fixed.

55
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,601
Been here
since the Romans ruled.

56
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,167
What's happening?

57
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,685
Don't go
in the kitchen, Georgie.

58
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:35,841
Not without your wellies.

59
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,207
Yes. Hello.
We've had a burst pipe.

60
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,407
<i>Just one moment, please.</i>

61
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,170
Excuse me. Ellen!

62
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,641
Can you please get the door?
I've got the plumbers here.

63
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,211
That was quick work,
wasn't it?

64
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,482
- Here, Georgie. Take them.
-17 Cherry Tree Lane.

65
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,641
<i>By</i> the <i>park?</i>

66
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,166
Yes, I'm coming! Blimey.

67
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,410
Good morning, mum.

68
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,369
They don't look
much like plumbers to me.

69
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,567
I meant on the phone.

70
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,165
We are not plumbers,
we are lawyers.

71
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,367
Lawyers?

72
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,408
And here's me
hoping you might prove useful.

73
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,001
Water's off!

74
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,081
And the plumbers
are on their way.

75
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,527
Well done, everybody.
Such excitement.

76
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,409
What are you doing here,
Aunt Jane?

77
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,403
We're handing out
breakfast at the union hall.

78
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,085
I snuck away
for a morning hug.

79
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,129
Come here, Georgie.

80
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:19,484
Will you stop that banging?

81
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,603
Barely eight o'clock
on a Sunday morning!

82
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,408
What you doing with my mop?

83
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,166
Forgive the intrusion, mum.

84
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,681
Our current workload prevents
us from taking weekends off.

85
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:30,887
We would like to have a word

86
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,564
with Mr. Banks,
if he is available.

87
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,444
"Notice of Repossession"?

88
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,247
Wait there.

89
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,970
Goodness. I'll be cleaning up
that mess all morning.

90
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,087
Here, let me take that
for you.

91
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,207
Thank you, sweetheart.

92
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,281
Excuse me, sir.

93
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,850
The wolves are at the door.

94
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,246
What do they want?

95
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,368
Well, a good thrashing,
if you ask me.

96
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,568
It's like
the River Thames in there!

97
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,131
Don't worry, Ellen.
I'll clean up.

98
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,326
Why don't you see
to the breakfast?

99
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,050
Well, yes, somebody's got to,
haven%they?

100
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,248
Unless we all wanna starve.

101
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,365
Why don't you let Ellen
clean up?

102
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,204
I'm afraid, lately,
that means more work for me.

103
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,646
The other day,
I found a butcher's sack

104
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,721
hanging on the coat rack...

105
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,120
- and my hat was in the larder.
- Dear.

106
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,201
Can we go to the park?

107
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,281
No, Georgie.

108
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,361
I need a brush!
I look a fright.

109
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,164
Michael, don't forget
you've got guests at the door.

110
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,407
Right.

111
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,081
I'm sorry.

112
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,004
We're struggling through a bit
of chaos this morning.

113
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,764
- Please.
- So it seems.

114
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:17,730
Unfortunately, Mr. Banks,
our business cannot wait.

115
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,484
- Excuse me, sir.
- Today, we were...

116
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,085
How exactly am I
supposed to make breakfast

117
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,366
when there's nothing
in the larder...

118
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,885
but pickled herrings
and marmalade?

119
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,243
The groceries.
I meant to go yesterday.

120
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,006
Very well.
Pickled herrings for breakfast

121
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,650
and marmalade for lunch.

122
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,842
There's a shop
across the park, will be open.

123
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,888
- The three of us can go.
- Thank you, John.

124
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,849
But you said we would go
to the park today!

125
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:38,921
We can cut through the park
on the way.

126
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,001
But...

127
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,161
Enough, Georgie, come along.

128
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,241
I'll take that, Father.

129
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,084
Thank you.
Please come through.

130
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,443
Now, what is it
that I can do for you?

131
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,001
I am Hamilton Gooding.
This is Mr. Templeton Frye.

132
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,050
We are solicitors with
the law firm of Gordy, Cordry,

133
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,804
- Gooding and Frye.

134
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:57,961
What?

135
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,804
No. Sorry, nothing.

136
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,405
Uspruceur?

137
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,642
Is that your garden club?

138
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,804
No, it's the Society for
the Protection of the Rights

139
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,450
of the Underpaid Citizens
of England.

140
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,682
A labor organizer.

141
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,530
She's a labor organizer.

142
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:13,681
Yes.

143
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,928
Yes, but we also run
soup kitchens.

144
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,162
It's a never-ending job
these days, I'm afraid.

145
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,970
I'm sure it is, Mrs. Banks.

146
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,327
Miss Banks, actually.
I'm Michael's sister.

147
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,050
My wife passed away
this last year.

148
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,771
That's awful.
Those poor children.

149
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:29,048
Yes. Our deepest condolences.

150
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,201
Thank you. Forgive me,

151
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,327
what brings the two of you
here this morning?

152
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,329
I'm going to say my goodbyes.
I'm late for work.

153
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,641
Mr. Banks, you took out a loan

154
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,926
with the
Fidelity Fiduciary Bank...

155
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,287
last year against the value
of your home.

156
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,601
You did what? Michael.

157
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,649
I had to, Jane.

158
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,121
With Kate and the bills piling
up, I really had no choice.

159
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,487
It's hard enough these days,
isn't it?

160
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,324
Yes. Well...

161
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,686
It seems you have fallen

162
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,286
three months behind
in your payments.

163
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,964
On.

164
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,326
I'm so sorry.

165
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:58,529
Kate, my wife, used to
look after our finances.

166
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,166
And I've been
a bit off stride. Forgive me.

167
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,448
How much is it
that I owe you, exactly?

168
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:06,120
Unfortunately,
the bank is now demanding

169
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:09,488
that you pay back
the entire loan in full.

170
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,526
The entire loan?

171
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,806
Yes. It's all in the contract.

172
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,610
That's more than I make in
a year. I couldn't possibly.

173
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,171
Dear.

174
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,124
You have five days.

175
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,209
If you are unable
to pay in full

176
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,520
by Friday at midnight...

177
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,887
I'm afraid we will have
to repossess your home...

178
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,401
and you will have to vacate
the premises.

179
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:30,884
But I work
for Fidelity Fiduciary.

180
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,570
Not as an accountant,
I presume.

181
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,801
No, as a teller.

182
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,206
I took a part-time position
there this past year.

183
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,486
You see, I'm really an artist.

184
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,801
Yes, be that as it may.

185
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:41,282
But my father, George Banks,
was a senior partner there.

186
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,680
Father left us shares
in the bank.

187
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,330
You could use those
to pay off the loan.

188
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,686
I was saving those
for the children.

189
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:48,002
Shares? In the bank?

190
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,606
Well, that does change things,
doesn't it?

191
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,809
Primed and ready,
Mr. Binnacle?

192
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,689
Ready and charged, sir.

193
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,251
Do you have
the share certificate?

194
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,169
- I'm sorry, the what?
- The document...

195
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,840
The document proving
you own shares in the bank.

196
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,044
I suppose it must be somewhere
among Father's old papers.

197
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,241
Yes, I suppose it must.

198
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,561
Three...

199
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,641
two...

200
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,366
One!

201
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,681
Fire!

202
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,001
Good heavens!

203
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,445
Are you housing anarchists?

204
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,126
No, that's the Admiral,
next door.

205
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,804
He fires off a cannon
to mark the hour.

206
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,645
He's over five minutes late.

207
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,251
Yes. I'm afraid
he's been running

208
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,203
a little behind
these last few years.

209
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,283
As are we, this morning.

210
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,721
You've been given notice.

211
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:40,282
We'll see ourselves out.
Come along, Mr. Frye.

212
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,602
I do hope you find that share
certificate. I really do.

213
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:45,331
Good day to you both!

214
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:49,160
You really have chosen the
wrong profession, you know.

215
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:56,566
Why didn't you tell me
you'd taken out a loan?

216
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,642
I didn't want to worry you.

217
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,445
Or the children.

218
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,491
I kept thinking
I would catch up.

219
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,324
Kate always managed.

220
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,167
Of all
the thick-headed mistakes.

221
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,811
I can't lose our home, Jane.
She's everywhere, here.

222
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,247
Well, then, we're not
going to let that happen.

223
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,368
But, Michael, you know we
neither of us have any money,

224
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,164
so we just have to find
that share certificate.

225
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,924
Do you have any idea where
Father might have kept it?

226
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,081
I don't know.

227
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,400
- In the attic, perhaps?
- Yes.

228
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,164
I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to bring you into all of this.

229
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,486
Michael!

230
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,766
Michael!

231
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,809
This is our family home,
and you're about to lose it.

232
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:30,566
So please stop pretending
everything's fine. You need...

233
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,041
Are we going to lose our home?

234
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,565
- No. No, no, no.
- No, no. I...

235
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,290
Aunt Jane was only...

236
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,329
I was just saying
you won't have to worry,

237
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,402
because your father
owns shares in the bank.

238
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,564
But you said we don't have
enough money.

239
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,770
Well, I can make more money.

240
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,685
I am a banker now, aren't I?
That's what bankers do.

241
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,405
Make money.

242
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,887
But you're not a banker.
You're a painter.

243
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,691
Yes, well,
painters don't make money.

244
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:58,081
Not these days. Here, you see.

245
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,242
The day has hardly begun,

246
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,727
and I have already made you
10 pounds!

247
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,768
We'd best be going.

248
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,207
Yes, yes, let's get
your hats on, shall we?

249
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:08,841
One moment, John.

250
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,610
Georgie shouldn't have to
spend his 10 pounds

251
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,806
on the shopping, should he?

252
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,246
Here you are.

253
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,609
Thank you, Father.

254
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,764
Off to the park, I see.

255
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,644
- Yes, that's right, Ellen.
- That's nice.

256
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,846
Shall we search
the attic, then?

257
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:24,921
Don't you have to go to work?

258
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,445
No. Work can wait.

259
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,601
Thank you, Jane.

260
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,847
Well, why don't I check
the attic

261
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:29,921
and you check Father's
old wardrobe?

262
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,081
- Yes.
- We'll make lunch...

263
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,241
when we get home, Ellen.

264
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,924
Gillie stays here.

265
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:38,886
Blimey, what little
grown-ups you've become.

266
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,645
Father didn't give us
enough, did he?

267
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,801
Not nearly.

268
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:47,088
Well, we can ask for
day-old bread at half off.

269
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,930
That's what Mother used to do.

270
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,081
Hello, Willoughby!

271
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,641
Hello, Miss Lark!

272
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,007
Hello, Georgie. Twins.

273
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,326
Good boy, Willoughby.

274
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,448
Come on, Georgie, we haven't
got enough time for this.

275
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,170
- Aw.
- Come along. Come on, Will.

276
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,049
The balloon lady!
Can we get balloons?

277
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,851
No, Georgie! We haven't enough
for groceries as it is.

278
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,924
Oi! Georgie Banks!
Keep off the grass.

279
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,969
I don't spend all day
caring for it

280
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,280
just to see my work
get trampled on.

281
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,441
Go on, off it!

282
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,726
Sorry.

283
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,247
What if Father
does lose the house?

284
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,006
We'll just have to
figure out a way

285
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,366
to get it back, I suppose.

286
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,086
You're right.
That's what Mother would do.

287
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,761
No.

288
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,921
<i>We haven't spoken
in so long, dear</i>

289
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,766
<i>This year has gone by
in a blur</i>

290
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:16,401
<i>Today, seems
everything's gone wrong here</i>

291
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,723
<i>I'm looking
for the way things were</i>

292
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:23,842
<i>I know you'd laugh
and call me tragic</i>

293
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:27,044
<i>For everything's
in disarray</i>

294
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:31,521
<i>These rooms
were always full of magic</i>

295
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,569
<i>That's vanished...</i>

296
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:37,088
<i>Since you went away</i>

297
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:45,442
<i>This house is crowded now
with questions</i>

298
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,570
<i>Your John's
a walking questionnaire</i>

299
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,361
<i>And I could surely use
a few suggestions</i>

300
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:55,649
<i>On how to brush
our daughter's hair</i>

301
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:59,361
<i>When Georgie
needed explanations</i>

302
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:02,763
<i>You always knew
just what to say</i>

303
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:06,322
<i>And I miss
our family conversations</i>

304
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,005
<i>It's silent...</i>

305
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:11,122
<i>Since you went away</i>

306
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,285
<i>Winter has gone</i>

307
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:20,084
<i>But not from this room</i>

308
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,528
<i>Snow's left the lane</i>

309
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:28,083
<i>But the cherry trees
forgot to bloom</i>

310
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,721
The certificate.

311
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,442
The certificate.

312
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:41,171
<i>I'll carry on
the way you told me</i>

313
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,567
<i>I say that
like I have a choice</i>

314
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,770
<i>And though you are not here
to hold me</i>

315
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,284
<i>In the echoes,
I can hear your voice</i>

316
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:56,841
<i>But still one question
fills my day, clear</i>

317
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,322
<i>The answer
I've most longed to know</i>

318
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,246
<i>Each moment
since you went away, dear</i>

319
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,641
<i>My question, Kate, is...</i>

320
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,409
<i>Where'd you go?</i>

321
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,843
Nothing in the wardrobe!

322
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,045
My goodness.

323
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,481
Yes, it's quite a mess.

324
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,090
Yes, it is.

325
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,406
What are all your art things
doing up here?

326
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:32,450
I wasn't
using them anymore.

327
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:36,365
I should probably just
get rid of it all.

328
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,489
Have you looked
in Father's old desk?

329
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,886
I honestly
can't remember why we kept

330
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,200
most of this stuff
to begin with.

331
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,887
I mean, why on earth did we
save this old broken thing?

332
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,281
Don't you remember that kite?

333
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:53,169
We used to love flying that
with Mother and Father.

334
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,609
Well, it won't fly anymore.

335
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,325
Out it goes.

336
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,370
No looking back.

337
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:58,008
<i>Hold on tight
to those you love</i>

338
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,164
<i>And maybe soon
from up above</i>

339
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,409
Willoughby!

340
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,449
Naughty boy.

341
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,645
Hush.

342
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,963
How long do you think
it will take us today?

343
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:28,369
Well, let's see. It's a
9-minute walk to the shop.

344
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,204
So if it takes 10 minutes...

345
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,281
to purchase each item...

346
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,407
Excuse me, children,
coming through!

347
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,046
Georgie! Come back!

348
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,804
- Georgie!
- You two!

349
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,367
I've told you before,
off the grass!

350
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,124
- But our brother!
- You heard me!

351
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,203
Now! What?

352
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,365
Help!

353
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,806
We're coming, Georgie!

354
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,241
Help!

355
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,041
Help!

356
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,727
- Hold on!
- Help me!

357
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,207
As I live and breathe.

358
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,727
You need to be more careful
when the wind rises, Georgie.

359
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,120
You nearly lost your kite.

360
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,408
And you two
nearly lost your Georgie.

361
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,886
He might have
got away completely

362
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:17,961
had I not been holding on

363
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,644
to the other end
of that string.

364
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,290
My goodness, Annabel...

365
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,448
what have you done
to your clothes?

366
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,965
You could grow a garden
in that much soil.

367
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,246
And, John...

368
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,845
yes, just as filthy.

369
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,491
How do you know our names?

370
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:32,042
Because she's Mary Poppins,
of course.

371
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,129
May I say, you look lovely,
as always.

372
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,085
Do you really think so?

373
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,526
Nice to see you, Jack.

374
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,762
Good to see you too,
Mary Poppins.

375
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:42,361
I was just your age
when we first met,

376
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,851
working for a chimney sweep.

377
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,206
How is dear old Bert?

378
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,408
Traveling the world, he is.
Off to points unknown.

379
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,891
Well, now I am off to speak

380
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,200
with the father
of these children.

381
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:51,930
This family is clearly
in desperate need of a nanny.

382
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,165
Now, quick march
and best foot forward,

383
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,083
and I'll thank you
not to dawdle.

384
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:01,801
Go on!

385
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,724
Father! Aunt Jane! Come quick!

386
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,086
- Quickly!
- What is it, Georgie?

387
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,850
Has something happened?

388
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,209
I was flying a kite
and it got caught on a nanny!

389
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,090
Whatever are you
talking about?

390
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,651
Come! Come, look!

391
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,245
Wait, where did you get
that kite?

392
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,643
I found it in the park.

393
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:26,167
She kept it from blowing away.

394
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,010
- Mary...
- Poppins.

395
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,805
Close your mouth please,
Michael.

396
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,291
We are still not a codfish.

397
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:40,608
Jane Banks, still rather
inclined to giggle, I see.

398
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,564
Good heavens,
it really is you.

399
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,165
You seem hardly
to have aged at all.

400
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,250
Really! How incredibly rude.

401
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,482
One never discusses
a woman's age, Michael.

402
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,971
I would have hoped
I taught you better.

403
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:56,242
- I'm sorry, I didn't mean...
- You came back.

404
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,447
I thought
we'd never see you again.

405
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,364
It is wonderful to see you.

406
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,049
Yes, it is, isn't it?

407
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,205
So, you know her, then?

408
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,169
Mary Poppins
used to be our nanny.

409
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:12,290
What brings you here
after all this time?

410
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,680
Same thing that
brought me the first time.

411
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,205
I've come to look after
the Banks children.

412
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,203
- Us?
- Yes, you too.

413
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,885
But we don't need a nanny.

414
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,530
Mother taught us
to look after ourselves.

415
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,523
You did just misplace Georgie,
I might point out.

416
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:25,126
Only slightly.
We got him back.

417
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,691
We can do anything
a nanny can.

418
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,569
Mary Poppins
flew here on a kite.

419
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,370
You can't do that, can you?

420
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,931
What are you talking about,
Georgie? Don't be silly.

421
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,570
Let him believe
what he likes.

422
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,484
When your father and I were
young, we used to imagine...

423
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:38,246
that Mary Poppins could do all
sorts of impossible things.

424
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:39,920
Actually...

425
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,401
"Actually," what?

426
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,481
Actually, I'd like to get back

427
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,561
to the matter
of my employment.

428
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,085
Your umbrella talks!

429
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,241
Georgie, please,

430
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,446
we're in the midst
of a grown-up conversation.

431
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,523
Why don't we go
upstairs, Georgie?

432
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,921
But it did talk! I promise!

433
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,366
I'm afraid Georgie sometimes

434
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,283
suffers from an excess
of imagination.

435
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,441
As I recall,

436
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,443
you had the same affliction
yourself when you were young.

437
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,802
Did I, really? Well,
those days are long behind me.

438
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,042
Are they, indeed?

439
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,009
- Now, about my employment...
- Yes, about your employment...

440
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,446
the truth is,
I simply can't afford...

441
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,011
We can settle on terms later,

442
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,241
although I will want
my old room back.

443
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,124
That's if it's not
a complete disaster...

444
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:13,129
and I will insist on having
every second Tuesday off.

445
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:15,561
- No, I'm afraid, I...
- Of course, Mary Poppins.

446
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:16,881
Good, good.
That's all settled.

447
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:19,691
Then I'll stay.
Now, if you'll excuse me...

448
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,285
the children have turned
themselves into dustbins.

449
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,805
So the first order of business

450
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,769
is to see them properly bathed
and dressed.

451
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,969
Jane, have you gone
completely mad?

452
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,690
I can't afford to take
on anyone else.

453
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:31,886
Mary Poppins
isn't just anyone.

454
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:32,961
Don't you see, Michael?

455
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,371
No one's
hiring nannies anymore.

456
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,646
The poor woman
has nowhere to go.

457
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:36,807
Well, neither will we
by the end of the week!

458
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:37,881
Don't be so grumpy.

459
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,007
- You sound just like Father.
- I do not!

460
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,127
Give Mary Poppins a chance.

461
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,486
You need help
just as much as she does!

462
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,524
Very well. She can stay
for the time being, I suppose.

463
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:48,569
After all, she did fly
all this way on a kite.

464
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:55,570
Those things, when we were
young, they didn't really...

465
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,721
- Happen?
- No.

466
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,006
- No.
- Of course not.

467
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,611
Ridiculous.

468
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,567
Hello, Mary Poppins.

469
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,404
Hello, Ellen.

470
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,001
How'd you do that?

471
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,366
Do what?

472
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:16,488
And why didn't Father believe
you flew here on a kite?

473
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,563
Because it's
complete nonsense, of course.

474
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,762
Grown-ups forget.
They always do.

475
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,410
That will be
quite enough of that.

476
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,682
I should have left you
in the umbrella stand.

477
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,524
Not with the canes!

478
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,166
What are you two
whispering about?

479
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,241
Nothing.

480
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,966
"Nothing."
Such a useful word, isn't it?

481
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:36,361
It can mean anything
and everything.

482
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,441
AN ANNABEL It's just that...

483
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,681
You don't require
the services of a nanny.

484
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,569
Well, we have grown up
a good deal

485
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,130
in the past year, after all.

486
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,880
Yes.

487
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,560
Well, we'll have to see
what can be done about that.

488
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,245
That was
our mother's, be careful.

489
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,562
I am always careful.

490
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:53,085
So, you're staying?

491
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:56,210
Yes, I'll stay.
Until the door opens.

492
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:57,521
What does that mean?

493
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,165
That door's always opening.

494
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:01,288
Not that door,
another one.

495
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,204
The bathroom door?

496
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:05,282
That's just silly, Georgie.

497
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,808
- Not the bathroom door?
- No.

498
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,564
But a bath would prove useful.

499
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,405
Come along.
Time for a good, clean start.

500
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,363
Mother always had us
take our baths in the evening.

501
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,931
Well, in my experience,
Annabel...

502
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:22,730
the perfect time of day
to have a bath

503
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:23,926
is when one needs a wash.

504
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,441
Georgie, you will go first.

505
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,841
We are perfectly capable
of drawing our own baths.

506
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,371
How very helpful, John.

507
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,408
In that case,
you may turn off the tap.

508
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:35,530
But not quite yet, still need
to put in the bubbles.

509
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,250
But I don't like soap bubbles.

510
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,561
Well, then
you shall have to try

511
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,927
to avoid them at all costs.

512
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,722
She's a tough nut, isn't she?

513
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,284
All right then...

514
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,124
but we'll have to
get this done quickly!

515
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:50,806
Right, we still have to
get down to the grocers...

516
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,530
and it looks as though
it might rain.

517
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,682
- I know who you should ask.

518
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:55,921
Her umbrella can't talk,
Georgie.

519
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,127
The very idea.

520
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:58,446
How do you know it can't?

521
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,648
Because it can't.
The very notion is ridiculous.

522
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,484
Exactly right, Annabel.
It's nonsense.

523
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,926
Foolishness.

524
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,206
It makes no sense.

525
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,522
And if it makes no sense,
it can't be true.

526
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,564
<i>John, you're right</i>

527
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,324
<i>It's good to know
you're bright</i>

528
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:15,166
<i>For intellect
can wash away confusion</i>

529
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:18,403
<i>Georgie sees,
and Annabel agrees</i>

530
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:22,446
<i>Most folderol's
an optical illusion</i>

531
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:25,683
<i>You three know it's true
that one plus one is two</i>

532
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:30,004
<i>Yes, logic is the rock
of our foundation</i>

533
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:34,490
<i>I suspect,
and I'm never incorrect</i>

534
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:40,761
<i>That you're far too old
to give in to imagination</i>

535
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,480
No, not yet.

536
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:49,283
<i>Some people like
to splash and play</i>

537
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,522
<i>Can you imagine that?</i>

538
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:54,286
<i>And take a seaside holiday</i>

539
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,920
<i>Can you imagine that?</i>

540
00:28:57,080 --> 00:29:01,130
<i>Too much glee leaves
rings around the brain</i>

541
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:05,725
<i>Take that joy
and send it down the drain</i>

542
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,962
<i>Some people
like to laugh at life</i>

543
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,485
<i>And giggle through the day</i>

544
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,731
<i>They think the world's
a brand-new, shiny toy</i>

545
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,448
<i>And if while dreaming
in the clouds</i>

546
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,602
<i>They fall and go kersplat</i>

547
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,922
<i>Although they're down
and bent in half</i>

548
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,002
<i>They brush right off
and start to laugh!</i>

549
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:26,960
<i>Can you imagine that?</i>

550
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,729
On second thoughts,
perhaps you're right.

551
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,689
It makes no sense to take
a bath this early.

552
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:37,002
Wait! I want to take a bath!

553
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:38,725
Really?

554
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,843
Very well, then.

555
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,245
Up you go.

556
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,721
And in you go.

557
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:46,961
Georgie!

558
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,121
Georgie!

559
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,247
John!

560
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,243
What happened?
Will they be all right?

561
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,050
Well, it is just a bath,
after all.

562
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,121
But then again,
it's not my tub.

563
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,611
Shouldn't you go in
after them?

564
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,842
No, I had my bath
this morning, thank you.

565
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,004
Well, if you won't, I will!

566
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,810
Off we go.

567
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,402
<i>Some people like
to dive right in</i>

568
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,602
<i>Can you imagine that?</i>

569
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,524
<i>And ?ap about
in bathtub gin</i>

570
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,728
<i>Can you imagine that?</i>

571
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:47,168
<i>Doggies paddling
20 leagues below</i>

572
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:52,206
<i>Might seem real,
but we know it's not so</i>

573
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,962
<i>To cook without a recipe</i>

574
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,804
<i>Can you imagine that?</i>

575
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,129
<i>And heaven knows what lives
within that pot!</i>

576
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:08,088
<i>Some pirates follow
treasure maps</i>

577
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,924
<i>And wear a silly hat</i>

578
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,003
<i>They search the world
for buried gold</i>

579
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:14,083
<i>They won't grow up
and don't grow old!</i>

580
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,242
<i>Can you imagine that?</i>

581
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:37,284
Be sure to scrub
behind your ears!

582
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,968
<i>Some answer
when adventure calls!</i>

583
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,685
<i>Can you imagine that?</i>

584
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:16,968
<i>And sail straight
over waterfalls!</i>

585
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,810
<i>Can you imagine that?</i>

586
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:22,250
<i>They see living
as its own reward</i>

587
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,447
Ahoy!

588
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:25,204
<i>They rock the boat,
then...</i>

589
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:27,248
- Whoa!
- Man overboard!

590
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,323
<i>Some people
look out on the sea</i>

591
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,765
<i>And see a brand-new day</i>

592
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:35,200
<i>Their spirit lifts them high
above the blue</i>

593
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:38,409
<i>Yet, some others
wear an anchor</i>

594
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:41,006
<i>And they sink
in seconds flat</i>

595
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,291
<i>So...</i>

596
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:45,642
<i>Perhaps we've learn't
when day is done</i>

597
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,563
<i>Some stuff and nonsense
could be fun!</i>

598
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:54,691
<i>Can you imagine that?</i>

599
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:11,686
No.

600
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,206
No.

601
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,086
No.

602
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,241
No. Anything?

603
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,401
No, nothing.

604
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:21,164
Just your old drawings,
and bills, and nothing else.

605
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:22,401
Well, then that's it,
it's not here.

606
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:23,601
Father, Aunt Jane!

607
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:26,411
It was amazing! And
then there were these boats!

608
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:27,891
Everything you could
ever dream of!

609
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,564
And then,
he fell in the water!

610
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,245
Not now, please.

611
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,568
But it really happened!
Tell him, Mary Poppins!

612
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,643
I have no idea
what you're all talking about.

613
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,086
We swam through a pirate ship!

614
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,851
Enough, please!

615
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,720
You're right, Father.
We're sorry.

616
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,688
No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

617
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,446
I don't mean to be cross
with all of you. I...

618
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:55,331
I've just lost something
very important.

619
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,131
Yes. And we're
going to find it.

620
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:58,770
I'm sure your grandfather just

621
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,285
tucked it away somewhere
for safekeeping.

622
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,680
The bank!

623
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,729
Didn't Father have a safety
deposit box in the bank?

624
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:04,881
Yes. Yes, he did.

625
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,485
- Well, let's go.
-It's closed.

626
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:07,641
We'll go first thing
in the morning.

627
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:08,721
But won't we need a key?

628
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,006
There's a whole drawer
full of keys

629
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:11,366
in Father's old desk upstairs.

630
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:12,646
- ls there?
- Yes!

631
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,962
My goodness, gracious,
glory me.

632
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,211
You'd think
by now they'd have learned

633
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,203
to pick up after themselves.

634
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:39,008
Cleaning is not a spectator
sport, I'll remind you.

635
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,161
John, Annabel,
put all the books

636
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:41,241
back on the bookshelves.

637
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:43,482
Georgie Banks, come back here.

638
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:45,967
Take out this rubbish,
would you?

639
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,087
Yes, Mary Poppins.

640
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:48,765
There's a good boy.

641
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,929
Off you go, spit spot-

642
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:28,961
Well.

643
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,325
That's that.

644
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:35,442
What about Mr. Dawes, Jr.?

645
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:38,080
Couldn't he give you
more time?

646
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:40,044
Yes, I'm sure he could
if he were still here...

647
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:43,847
but Dawes' nephew has been
running things lately.

648
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,128
I don't think he even knows
who I am.

649
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,884
- Thank you.
- Very good, sir.

650
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:50,731
Well, it's high time he found
out, don't you think?

651
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,682
Jane?

652
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,481
Jane!

653
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,040
Jane!

654
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:07,041
Jane!

655
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,130
- Banks.
- Good morning.

656
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,611
Sorry.

657
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:17,924
Jane. We can't just charge
into his office.

658
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:21,448
Hello, Miss Penny Farthing,
is it?

659
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:24,080
Heavens, did the old secretary
finally retire?

660
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,642
She always had
that big jar of sweets

661
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,006
on the desk
we'd raid as children.

662
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,770
I remember that jar.

663
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:33,086
Those little toffees that
stuck your teeth together.

664
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,242
Must get you one of
those jars, Miss Farthing.

665
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,004
Of course, sir.

666
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,081
This wouldn't happen

667
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,286
to be your sister,
would it, Mr. Banks?

668
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:42,089
- Yes.
- Yes, Jane Banks.

669
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,161
How do you do?

670
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:45,448
Great pleasure to meet you.
William Wetherall Wilkins.

671
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:47,404
Do step this way.

672
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,566
If I had known...

673
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:57,881
that George Banks' son
had taken a loan with us...

674
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:00,202
I would have handled
the paperwork myself.

675
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,402
Unfortunately...

676
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:03,846
regarding an extension,

677
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,968
there's very little I can do
at this point.

678
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,161
I see.

679
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,641
Our father did leave us shares
in the bank.

680
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:12,246
Well, that is good news!

681
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,401
Yes. Yes, it is.

682
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:14,561
But the trouble is,

683
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,210
we can't seem to find
the share certificate.

684
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:17,725
You wouldn't happen
to have any record

685
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:18,926
of Father's shares, would you?

686
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,889
- I would think so.

687
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,041
Bring in the shareholder's ledger,

688
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,121
would you, Miss Farthing?

689
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,770
<i>Right away, Mr. Wilkins.</i>

690
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:27,966
And what about your uncle,
Mr. Dawes, Jr.?

691
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:30,771
He'd know if Father received
shares, wouldn't he?

692
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,923
I'm afraid

693
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,128
dear old Uncle Dawes
is getting on in years.

694
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,928
<i>Non compos mentis...</i>

695
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:41,367
Which, sadly, is why
I had to take over for him.

696
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,010
Thank you, Miss Farthing.

697
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,045
Let's see.

698
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:47,801
"Babcock...

699
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,325
"Baker..."

700
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:58,923
Doesn't seem to be a listing
for George Banks here.

701
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,730
Don't despair.

702
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:05,280
You still have until
that big fellow out there

703
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,521
chimes his last
on Friday night...

704
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:07,881
to find that certificate.

705
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:10,088
And I'll keep looking here
as well.

706
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:12,481
Yes, well, thank you
so very much, Mr. Wilkins.

707
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:14,887
It's really been
a great pleasure. Thank you.

708
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,565
Very kind of you.
Thank you, Mr. Wilkins.

709
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:17,846
Not at all.

710
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:28,884
Bring in all of George Banks'
old files, would you?

711
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,008
<i>Of course, Mr. Wilkins.</i>

712
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,085
Georgie, this is a nursery,

713
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:11,531
let me remind you,
and not a music hall.

714
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:13,921
Can we have another bath?

715
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,121
Pish posh.

716
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,170
Now, John,
you'd best go downstairs

717
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:18,241
- and help Ellen...

718
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,481
- Whoa!
- ...put away the dishes.

719
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:21,005
Yes, Mary Poppins.

720
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:23,049
Here, I can
put those away myself.

721
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,043
Very well, then.

722
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,365
Now, Georgie Banks...

723
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,170
if you were hoping
that I will let you

724
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:30,526
take this
sadly neglected kite...

725
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:31,767
to the park tomorrow,

726
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,330
you'd better start
patching it up this instant.

727
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:35,130
Yes, Mary Poppins.

728
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,682
Let me help you
with those.

729
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,683
You're a good lad.

730
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,968
You're such a help, you are.

731
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,610
I only wish
I could help your father

732
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:50,284
save this poor old house.

733
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:53,569
I could sell my broach
and necklace, I suppose.

734
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:57,247
Matching set,
my old mum gave them to me.

735
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,640
You'd do that for us?

736
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,882
What?
Sell my prized possessions?

737
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:02,241
No,
I didn't mean it like that.

738
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,529
It's all right.
I think they're fakes, anyway.

739
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:09,483
No. Plenty in this house worth
more than them old trinkets.

740
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,643
If you'll excuse me, Ellen.

741
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:17,724
What's got into him?

742
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:24,844
Annabel!

743
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,248
- I know how to save the house!
- What do you mean?

744
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,408
If you two are going to keep
up all of this whispering...

745
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:30,641
I'd like you
to practice doing so

746
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:31,721
as loudly as possible.

747
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:33,405
It will still be bad manners,

748
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:35,528
but at least then we'll all
be in on the secret.

749
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:39,121
Hello, Jack!

750
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,408
Mary Poppins,
how are you this fine evening?

751
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:43,722
I'm settling in
quite nicely, thank you.

752
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,691
I was downstairs
with Ellen...

753
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,086
Do you know,
when I was a lad...

754
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,971
I used to wave up to the boy
and girl who lived here.

755
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,849
You mean Michael and Jane.

756
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:56,370
Miss Jane Banks!

757
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:57,681
I see Mr. Banks
about now and again.

758
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,125
It's been ages
since I've seen her.

759
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,009
Well, she lives in a flat
on the other side of town now.

760
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:03,527
I'm sure you'll bump into her
one of these days.

761
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,446
What are you doing?

762
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:06,567
You know we're not supposed
to touch that.

763
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:09,450
This is authentic
Royal Doulton china, Annabel.

764
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,489
Mother always said
it was priceless...

765
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:14,009
and I bet it'll be enough
to pay off Father's debt.

766
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,081
That's a terrible idea, John.

767
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,201
You know
Mother loved that bowl.

768
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:17,611
But she'd sell it herself
to save the house!

769
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:18,966
That was Mother's!
Put that back!

770
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:20,411
No, Georgie,
give it to me!

771
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,483
- No! Put it back!
- Let go, let go!

772
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:23,561
It's a good thing
you come along

773
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:24,971
- when you did, Mary Poppins.

774
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:29,045
That didn't sound good,
now did it?

775
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,364
What are the three of you
up to?

776
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:35,045
- Give me the missing piece!
- I don't have it!

777
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,850
Well, look for it then!

778
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,725
Which of you broke the bowl?

779
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:49,970
- Georgie did.
- I did not! It was Annabel!

780
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:51,406
No, I didn't!
If John hadn't taken it...

781
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:54,366
Actually,
it was all three of them.

782
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:58,089
Who said that?

783
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:03,487
Dear.

784
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:04,721
Look!
The picture's changed.

785
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:06,211
It looks
as though they've broken

786
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:07,520
your carriage wheel.

787
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:09,648
That they have.
It's useless now.

788
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:12,007
Useless
as a chocolate teapot.

789
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:13,400
The bowl is speaking!

790
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:15,210
And who do we think
is gonna fix that?

791
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:16,964
Aye, there's the riddle.
Them what broke it fixes it.

792
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,201
That's what I say.

793
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:19,850
What do you think,
Mary Poppins?

794
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,411
Well, I suppose
we have no choice.

795
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:23,011
But how are we
going to do that?

796
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:24,730
I know a bit
about fixing carriages.

797
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:26,086
But we can't fix
the carriage wheel.

798
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:27,207
It isn't possible.

799
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:31,087
Everything is possible.
Even the impossible.

800
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:35,286
Now, gather 'round,
everyone. Spit, spot!

801
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:37,602
Georgie, don't forget Gillie.

802
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:38,841
Are we ready?

803
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:39,921
Ready.

804
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:12,561
What just happened?

805
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,928
Where are we?

806
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,449
Looks like we're in china,
so to speak.

807
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:21,091
Over here, everyone.
This wheel won't fix itself.

808
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:23,681
Now, tread lightly,
this is fine porcelain,

809
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:25,842
and we don't want
to chip the glaze.

810
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:30,083
Wheel.

811
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:32,242
Georgie, head up
and feet beneath you.

812
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:34,045
You too, John.

813
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:39,485
Excuse me, driver,
would you help us?

814
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:43,290
Well, Mary Poppins,
is it yourself?

815
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:44,930
- But he's...
- But you're...

816
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:49,130
- That's right, I'm Irish.
- I'm also part poodle.

817
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:52,324
How wonderful
to see you, Shamus.

818
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:53,771
I'm so sorry about all this.

819
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:55,729
Now, would you help Jack
lift the carriage

820
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,802
while the children
put the wheel back on?

821
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:59,007
With pleasure!

822
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:01,003
She's talking to a dog!

823
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:03,407
Well, of course she can talk.

824
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:05,686
Take your places,
everyone.

825
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:08,560
Ready?

826
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:11,088
And lift.

827
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:15,286
Yes. Let's see now,
this should do it.

828
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:17,411
There we are, shipshape.

829
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:18,846
Not a bad job at all.

830
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,411
Suppose it'll have to do.

831
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:23,085
And back to the nursery we go.

832
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:24,287
Back already?

833
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:25,905
Can't we stay in this bowl
for a while?

834
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:28,167
I want a carriage ride.

835
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:29,924
I wouldn't mind one myself.

836
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:34,450
Well, I suppose
it wouldn't do any harm.

837
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:35,726
Shamus, would you mind?

838
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:37,041
Not in the least.

839
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:38,361
Climb aboard, everybody!

840
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:39,885
Hooray!

841
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:42,805
Mind the step,
plant yourselves comfy.

842
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:45,884
Now, where would we all like
to go on this fine, fine day?

843
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:48,850
The Royal Doulton Music Hall,
please.

844
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:50,765
- Where?
- What's that?

845
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:52,809
We're on the brink
of an adventure, children,

846
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:55,042
don't spoil it
with too many questions.

847
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:56,361
Let's go, Clyde!

848
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:57,851
Easy.

849
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:02,362
<i>In the nursery,
you were never by yourself</i>

850
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:06,730
<i>There was quite another
world upon your shelf</i>

851
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:07,881
Hold on!

852
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:11,002
<i>Where each day
crowds make their way</i>

853
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:12,809
<i>Upon the sun's descent</i>

854
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:16,442
<i>To a mythical, mystical,
never-quite-logistical tent</i>

855
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:19,963
<i>Yes, in this
dearly dynamical</i>

856
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:23,010
<i>Simply ceramical
Royal Doulton bowl</i>

857
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:24,969
<i>There's a cuddly
and curious</i>

858
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:28,010
<i>Furry and furious
animal watering hole</i>

859
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:30,009
<i>Where the monkeys
and humming birds</i>

860
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:31,326
<i>Know the tunes
and the words</i>

861
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:33,050
<i>Every beast
large and small</i>

862
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:35,123
<i>Loves the very
top drawer-able</i>

863
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:39,967
<i>Always encore-able
Royal Doulton Music Hall</i>

864
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:41,930
Ooh, that one tickled my tail.

865
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:43,809
Nearly there, Mary Poppins!

866
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:47,563
<i>Yes,
in this marvelous, mystical</i>

867
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:50,650
<i>Rather sophistical
Royal Doulton bowl</i>

868
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:52,450
<i>There's a lot of birds
queuing up</i>

869
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:55,610
<i>A lot of hams chewing up
scenery they swallow whole</i>

870
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:57,603
<i>There are lots of cats
tuning strings</i>

871
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:59,000
<i>Nightingales
in the wings</i>

872
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:00,810
<i>Waiting for
their big drum roll</i>

873
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:03,804
<i>- At the simply sensational
-Standing ovation-al</i>

874
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:07,760
<i>- Royal Doulton Music Hall
-Music Hall</i>

875
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:09,490
Here we are!

876
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:13,682
But where's the music hall?

877
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:17,130
Yes, that. Silly me.

878
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:31,601
Step right up!

879
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:33,887
Step right up
for the simply sensational

880
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:36,088
Royal Doulton Music Hall!

881
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:38,527
How on earth did she do that?

882
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:40,589
One thing you should know
about Mary Poppins...

883
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:42,768
she never explains anything.
Come on.

884
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:44,763
Hurry, hurry!
Only a few seats left!

885
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:48,242
Get tickets while you can
for the one-night only...

886
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:51,529
one and only...
Mary Poppins!

887
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:53,251
What an honor it is

888
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:54,731
to have you join us
this evening.

889
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:55,881
Thank you.

890
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:57,491
And who is this I see?

891
00:46:57,640 --> 00:47:00,564
Why, it's John,
Annabel and Georgie Banks!

892
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:01,721
You know us?

893
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:04,127
Of course. Everyone knows
the Banks children.

894
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:06,851
We've all been watching you
in the nursery for years.

895
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,365
It's so good
to finally meet you.

896
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:10,761
Hurry along, now.
Get yourselves some peanuts

897
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:12,842
and candy floss
and go right on in.

898
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,365
May we, Mary Poppins?

899
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:16,964
Yes.

900
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:18,690
Come on!
Let's get candy floss!

901
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:21,446
Just keep away
from the edge of the bowl.

902
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:32,208
<i>At the highly-acclaimable</i>

903
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:33,520
<i>Nearly untamable</i>

904
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:37,569
<i>Lavishly praisable,
always roof-raise-able</i>

905
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:42,041
<i>Royal Doulton</i>

906
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:46,444
<i>Music Hall!</i>

907
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:55,886
Excuse me.

908
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:11,561
Bucks and mares,
cubs and does,

909
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:13,244
welcome to our show of shows!

910
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:15,323
It is my great honor
to introduce

911
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:17,289
this evening's
renowned guest...

912
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:18,646
the one...

913
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:20,404
the only...

914
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:22,608
Mary Poppins!

915
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:27,188
Well, thank you, thank you
very much. Yes, thank you.

916
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:28,844
- Come on!
- No, no.

917
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,490
- Come on up!
- Go on!

918
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:32,324
Silly Jack.

919
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:39,449
- Thank you.
- Sing for us, Mary Poppins!

920
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:41,210
- No. No, no, no.
- Come on, have a go.

921
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:42,964
No, I haven't sung in years.

922
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:44,645
Sing for us, Mary Poppins.

923
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:46,165
- Please. Please.
- Do sing for us.

924
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:48,010
No, I couldn't possibly.

925
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:49,844
D-flat major.

926
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:05,445
<i>Uncle Gutenberg
was</i> a <i>bookworm</i>

927
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:07,841
<i>And he lived
on Charing Cross</i>

928
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,800
<i>The memory of his volumes
brings a smile</i>

929
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:14,481
<i>He would read me
lots of stories</i>

930
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:16,881
<i>When he wasn't
on the sauce</i>

931
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:19,407
<i>Now I'd like to share
the wisdom</i>

932
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:23,371
<i>Of my favorite bibliophile</i>

933
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:26,325
<i>He said</i>

934
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:29,603
<i>A cover is not the book</i>

935
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:31,762
<i>So open it up
and take a look</i>

936
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:33,285
<i>'Cause under the covers</i>

937
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:35,806
<i>One discovers
that the king may be a crook</i>

938
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:37,803
<i>Chapter titles
are like signs</i>

939
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:40,087
<i>And if you read
between the lines</i>

940
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:42,846
<i>You'll find your
first impression was mistook</i>

941
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:47,202
<i>For a cover is nice
but a cover is not the book</i>

942
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:52,846
Mary Poppins,
could you give us an example?

943
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:55,162
- Certainly!

944
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:57,769
<i>Nellie Rubina
was made of wood</i>

945
00:49:57,840 --> 00:49:59,080
<i>But what could not be seen</i>

946
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:01,447
<i>Was though her trunk up top
was barren</i>

947
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:03,289
<i>Well, her roots
were lush and green</i>

948
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:05,488
<i>So in spring
when Mr. Hickory</i>

949
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:07,289
<i>Saw her blossoms
blooming' there</i>

950
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:08,925
<i>He took root,
despite her bark</i>

951
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:11,401
<i>And now there's
seedlings everywhere!</i>

952
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:14,643
<i>Which proves</i>
a <i>cover is not the book</i>

953
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:16,290
<i>So open it up
and take a look</i>

954
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:17,601
<i>'Cause under the covers</i>

955
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:20,251
<i>One discovers
that the king may be a crook</i>

956
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:21,925
<i>Chapter titles
are like signs</i>

957
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:24,361
<i>And if you read
between the lines</i>

958
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:27,683
<i>You'll find your
first impression was mistook</i>

959
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:31,005
<i>For a cover is nice
but a cover is not the book!</i>

960
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:33,849
Shall we do the one
about the "Wealthy Widow"?

961
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,206
By all means!

962
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:36,407
Always loved that one!

963
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:37,766
Well, go on then.

964
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:41,931
<i>Lady Hyacinth Macaw brought
all her treasures to a reef</i>

965
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:44,242
<i>Where she only
wore a smile</i>

966
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:46,209
<i>Plus two feathers
and a leaf</i>

967
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:47,805
<i>So no one tried to rob her</i>

968
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:49,803
<i>'Cause she barely
wore a stitch</i>

969
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:51,644
<i>For when you're
in your birthday suit</i>

970
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:53,802
<i>There ain't much there
to show you're rich!</i>

971
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:55,803
<i>A cover
is not the book</i>

972
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:57,644
<i>So open it up
and take a look</i>

973
00:50:57,800 --> 00:50:59,006
<i>'Cause under the covers</i>

974
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:01,560
<i>One discovers
that the king may be a crook</i>

975
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:08,561
<i>You'll find your
first impression was mistook</i>

976
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:13,088
<i>For a cover is nice,
but a cover is not the book</i>

977
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:15,961
Give us the one about the
"Dirty Rascal," why don't ya?

978
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:17,326
Isn't that one a bit long?

979
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:18,606
Well, the quicker
you're into it,

980
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:19,881
the quicker you're out of it.

981
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:27,161
<i>Once upon a time
in a nursery rhyme</i>

982
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:29,129
<i>There was a castle
with a king hiding in a wing</i>

983
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:30,441
<i>'Cause he never
went to school</i>

984
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:31,646
<i>To learn a single thing</i>

985
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:33,768
<i>He had scepters and swords
And a parliament of Lords</i>

986
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:35,809
<i>But on the inside he was sad
Egad!</i>

987
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:37,849
<i>Because he never had
a wisdom for numbers</i>

988
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:38,921
<i>A wisdom for words</i>

989
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:40,127
<i>Though his crown
was quite immense</i>

990
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:41,366
<i>His brain was smaller
than a bird's</i>

991
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:43,568
<i>So the queen of the nation
made a royal proclamation</i>

992
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:44,926
<i>"To the missus
and the messers</i>

993
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,047
<i>"The more or lessers</i>

994
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:47,361
<i>"Bring me
all the land's professors"</i>

995
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:48,601
<i>Then she went
to the hair dressers</i>

996
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:50,922
<i>And they came from the East
And they came from the South</i>

997
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:52,206
<i>From each college,
they poured knowledge</i>

998
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:53,361
<i>From their brains
into his mouth</i>

999
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:54,567
<i>But the king
couldn't learn</i>

1000
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:55,721
<i>So each professor
met their fate</i>

1001
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:56,887
<i>For the queen
had their heads removed</i>

1002
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:57,961
<i>And placed upon the gate</i>

1003
00:51:58,040 --> 00:51:59,041
<i>And on that date</i>

1004
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:01,046
<i>I state their wives
all got a note</i>

1005
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:02,406
<i>Their mate
was now the late great</i>

1006
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:03,561
<i>But then suddenly one day</i>

1007
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:04,806
<i>A stranger started
in to sing</i>

1008
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:05,927
<i>He said,
"I'm the dirty rascal</i>

1009
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,047
<i>"And I'm here
to teach the king!"</i>

1010
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:08,246
<i>And the queen
clutched her jewels</i>

1011
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:09,481
<i>For she hated royal fools</i>

1012
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:10,766
<i>But this fool
had some rules</i>

1013
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:11,921
<i>They really ought
to teach in schools</i>

1014
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:13,127
<i>Like you'll be
a happy king</i>

1015
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:14,440
<i>If you enjoy
the things you've got</i>

1016
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:15,521
<i>You should never try to be</i>

1017
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:16,647
<i>The kind of person
that you're not</i>

1018
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:17,881
<i>So they sang
and they laughed</i>

1019
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:19,086
<i>For the king
had found a friend</i>

1020
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:21,760
<i>And they ran onto a rainbow
for the story's perfect end</i>

1021
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:23,922
<i>So the moral is you mustn't
let the outside be the guide</i>

1022
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:25,127
<i>For it's not so cut
and dried</i>

1023
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:26,281
<i>Well, unless
it's Doctor Jekyll</i>

1024
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:27,361
<i>Then you better hide</i>

1025
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:28,441
<i>Petrified!</i>

1026
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:29,931
<i>No, the truth
can't be denied</i>

1027
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:31,041
<i>As I have now
have testified</i>

1028
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:32,929
<i>All that really counts
and matters</i>

1029
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,890
<i>is the special
stuff inside!</i>

1030
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:37,929
- Hooray!
- He did it!

1031
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:41,329
A cover
<i>is</i> not the book

1032
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:43,050
<i>So open it up
and take a look</i>

1033
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:44,850
<i>'Cause under the covers</i>

1034
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:47,571
<i>One discovers
that the king may be a crook</i>

1035
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:49,404
<i>So please
listen to what we've said</i>

1036
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:51,568
<i>And open a book
tonight in bed</i>

1037
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,480
<i>So one more time
before we get the hook</i>

1038
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:55,687
<i>Sing it out strong!</i>

1039
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,002
<i>- A cover is nice
-Please take our advice</i>

1040
00:52:58,160 --> 00:52:59,924
<i>- A cover is nice
-Or you'll pay the price!</i>

1041
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:04,722
<i>A cover is nice
but a cover is not the book</i>

1042
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:14,362
Bravo!

1043
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:33,841
Gillie!

1044
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:45,370
Where's Georgie?

1045
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:46,965
I don't know.

1046
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:48,920
Take this.

1047
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:55,245
What are you doing?

1048
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:58,762
Well, well,
if it isn't the boy

1049
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:00,689
who cracked the bowl.

1050
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:03,963
We've waited a long time
for you Banks children...

1051
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:05,121
to come and visit us,

1052
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:07,806
so we could pay a visit
to your nursery.

1053
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:10,884
But those are our things!

1054
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:12,804
Not anymore,
they aren't.

1055
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:13,927
Give Gillie back!

1056
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:18,166
He's mine!
My mother made him for me!

1057
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:20,209
Hey! Leave our brother alone!

1058
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:21,765
Time to go, boys!

1059
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:38,284
Annabel! Help!

1060
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:40,204
Georgie!

1061
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:43,324
We're coming, Georgie!

1062
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:44,841
John!

1063
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:49,449
Let me go! I want to go home!

1064
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:52,484
What home?
You've lost your home!

1065
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:04,445
Shamus!

1066
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:05,601
Clyde!

1067
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:06,921
That's right, it's us!

1068
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:09,890
Let's go
get your brother back.

1069
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:20,124
We're gaining on 'em!

1070
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:22,121
Give it more speed!

1071
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:23,281
Right away, sir.

1072
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:43,761
Giddy-up, big fella!

1073
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:53,642
We're closing in.
Get ready to jump!

1074
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:57,885
Ready. And now!

1075
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:00,440
Well done, children!

1076
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:02,443
Give 'em what-for!

1077
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:04,564
Get rid of them!

1078
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:06,722
- But, sir!
- You heard me!

1079
00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:09,724
Georgie, are you all right?

1080
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:10,881
Annabel, look!

1081
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:34,842
- Stay with Georgie.
- Right.

1082
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,445
Be careful!

1083
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:44,726
What are you doing?

1084
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:15,926
No!

1085
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:19,642
The edge of the bowl!

1086
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:35,726
Georgie, it's all right,

1087
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:37,006
it's all right.

1088
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:38,764
My goodness me.

1089
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:41,889
It's all right.

1090
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:47,248
You were having a nice
sort of nightmare, I must say.

1091
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:49,966
You were right, Mary Poppins!
A cover is not the book.

1092
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:51,610
We thought they were nice,
but they were mean!

1093
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:53,330
Whatever are you
talking about?

1094
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:54,686
They tried to take Gillie!

1095
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:58,731
No, Gillie is right here,
sleeping, as you should be.

1096
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:01,281
But it was real!
They stole all our things...

1097
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:02,601
and the wolf said
we were never

1098
00:58:02,680 --> 00:58:03,886
going to see our home again!

1099
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:05,411
That is absurd.

1100
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:10,127
But I had a nightmare
like that, too.

1101
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:12,726
So did I.
It seemed awfully real.

1102
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:15,841
I don't want to lose our home.

1103
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:18,850
You see, Georgie?

1104
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:21,002
That's why we wanted
Mother's bowl.

1105
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:24,004
We were going to sell it
to save the house.

1106
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:28,244
I miss Mother.

1107
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:36,566
Listen
to the three of you.

1108
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:38,449
You're all worrying
far too much.

1109
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:43,561
After all, you can't lose
what you've never lost.

1110
00:58:44,360 --> 00:58:46,089
I don't understand.

1111
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:47,605
Well...

1112
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:52,561
<i>Do you ever
lie awake at night?</i>

1113
00:58:53,480 --> 00:58:58,566
<i>Just between the dark
and the morning light</i>

1114
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:04,490
<i>Searching for the things
you used to know</i>

1115
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:10,729
<i>Looking for the place
where the lost things go?</i>

1116
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:16,611
<i>Do you ever dream
or reminisce?</i>

1117
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:22,166
<i>Wondering where to find
what you truly miss?</i>

1118
00:59:22,520 --> 00:59:27,890
<i>Well, maybe all those things
that you love so</i>

1119
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:34,448
<i>Are waiting in the place
where the lost things go</i>

1120
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:40,444
<i>Memories you've shared,
gone for good you feared</i>

1121
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:43,365
<i>They're all
around you still</i>

1122
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:46,922
<i>Though they've disappeared</i>

1123
00:59:47,640 --> 00:59:53,044
<i>Nothing's really left
or lost without a trace</i>

1124
00:59:54,200 --> 01:00:00,731
<i>Nothing's gone forever,
only out of place</i>

1125
01:00:02,560 --> 01:00:07,441
<i>So maybe now the dish
and my best spoon</i>

1126
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:13,730
<i>Are playing hide and seek
just behind the Moon</i>

1127
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:20,164
<i>Waiting there
until it's time to show</i>

1128
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:23,645
<i>Spring is like that now</i>

1129
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:27,327
<i>Far beneath the snow</i>

1130
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:34,205
<i>Hiding in the place
where the lost things</i>

1131
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:36,610
<i>Go</i>

1132
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:39,604
Now, time to get some sleep.

1133
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:40,966
And in the morning,
bright and early...

1134
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:42,485
we'll take that bowl
to my cousin.

1135
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:43,891
We'll have it mended.

1136
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:53,291
<i>Time to close your eyes</i>

1137
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:56,649
<i>So sleep can come around</i>

1138
01:00:56,840 --> 01:00:58,490
<i>For when you dream</i>

1139
01:00:58,560 --> 01:01:03,248
<i>You'll find all that's lost
is found</i>

1140
01:01:03,720 --> 01:01:06,451
<i>Maybe on the Moon</i>

1141
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:10,281
<i>Or maybe somewhere new</i>

1142
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:17,050
<i>Maybe all you're missing
lives inside of you</i>

1143
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:24,765
<i>So, when you need her touch
and loving gaze</i>

1144
01:01:25,560 --> 01:01:31,203
<i>"Gone but not forgotten"
is the perfect phrase</i>

1145
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:38,240
<i>Smiling from a star
that she makes glow</i>

1146
01:01:39,120 --> 01:01:41,441
<i>Trust she's always there</i>

1147
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:45,483
<i>Watching as you grow</i>

1148
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:53,123
<i>Find her in the place
where the lost things</i>

1149
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:56,443
<i>Go</i>

1150
01:02:35,560 --> 01:02:36,891
John, look!

1151
01:02:40,520 --> 01:02:41,806
Mary Poppins' scarf.

1152
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:44,562
It wasn't a dream after all.

1153
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:46,929
Shall we tell her?

1154
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:48,761
Better not.

1155
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:51,648
I expect she already knows.

1156
01:03:09,680 --> 01:03:12,001
Blast the devil, too soon!

1157
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:15,846
Why can't those pea-brained
Big Ben buffoons get it right?

1158
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:19,887
Ahoy there, fair lady!

1159
01:03:20,040 --> 01:03:21,087
Hello!

1160
01:03:21,160 --> 01:03:23,003
Good morning.

1161
01:03:23,080 --> 01:03:24,081
I'm sorry, miss.

1162
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:25,491
No, no. It's quite
all right. Don't worry.

1163
01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:27,130
- Let me help you with that.
- Thank you.

1164
01:03:27,320 --> 01:03:28,560
Good morning, Jane.

1165
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:30,006
I see you've bumped into Jack.

1166
01:03:30,200 --> 01:03:31,770
The children and I are
heading into town

1167
01:03:31,840 --> 01:03:32,841
to get something fixed.

1168
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:34,160
Would you like to come
with us?

1169
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:37,130
Work calls, I'm afraid.
We've got a rally today.

1170
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:40,602
That's right. You ought to
give Jack one of those flyers.

1171
01:03:41,880 --> 01:03:43,325
You're Miss Banks, aren't you?

1172
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:44,401
Yes.

1173
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:45,845
I don't know
if you remember me.

1174
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,161
I used to wave to you
when I'd see you

1175
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:49,049
up there in that very window.

1176
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:50,247
Yes.

1177
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:51,447
Jack.

1178
01:03:51,640 --> 01:03:53,927
Yes, of course, I remember.

1179
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:55,320
Call me Jane, please.

1180
01:03:55,480 --> 01:03:56,811
Of course,
I was much younger then.

1181
01:03:56,880 --> 01:03:57,961
True...

1182
01:03:58,040 --> 01:04:00,566
but your smile
hasn't changed a bit.

1183
01:04:01,040 --> 01:04:03,850
Well, it's this afternoon,
if you can make it.

1184
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:05,201
Spruce?

1185
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:06,851
Good for you, Jane Banks.

1186
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:08,646
All us lamplighters know

1187
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:10,609
what a fine job you're doing
for the workers.

1188
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:12,364
Well, we try our best.

1189
01:04:12,520 --> 01:04:13,806
If you ever need
a ladder raised

1190
01:04:13,880 --> 01:04:15,370
or a lamp lit,
consider it done.

1191
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:18,410
Thank you, Jack. Thank you.

1192
01:04:20,120 --> 01:04:21,485
Polishing the keyhole, are we?

1193
01:04:21,640 --> 01:04:22,721
Look at this.

1194
01:04:22,920 --> 01:04:25,924
Miss Jane's chatting with
that handsome lamplighter.

1195
01:04:27,560 --> 01:04:29,085
It looks like he's lit her up
as well, don't it?

1196
01:04:29,160 --> 01:04:30,161
Ellen!

1197
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:31,446
No,
nothing will come of it.

1198
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:33,489
No, she says
that ship's sailed.

1199
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:35,170
And I say,
there are always other ships.

1200
01:04:35,320 --> 01:04:36,321
My alarm didn't ring.

1201
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:38,164
Dear. Let me help you.

1202
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:40,530
I'm gonna be late.

1203
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:41,721
That's all that I need!

1204
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:43,211
Well, you're not late yet,
are you?

1205
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:44,561
Here you are.

1206
01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:46,085
Off you go.

1207
01:04:49,320 --> 01:04:50,401
Good morning, Michael.

1208
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:51,481
Hello, forgive me,
I have to run.

1209
01:04:51,560 --> 01:04:52,561
Watch where you're...
Michael!

1210
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:53,641
I am so sorry!

1211
01:04:53,720 --> 01:04:54,767
It's fine.

1212
01:04:54,840 --> 01:04:57,446
Um, I'm looking for number 19.

1213
01:04:57,600 --> 01:04:58,965
It's two doors down.

1214
01:05:00,320 --> 01:05:02,448
Many thanks. Sincerely.

1215
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:05,763
Michael, your briefcase!

1216
01:05:05,960 --> 01:05:07,166
Blimey, he'd leave his head

1217
01:05:07,240 --> 01:05:09,481
on the breakfast table
if it weren't screwed on.

1218
01:05:09,640 --> 01:05:11,051
Here, Ellen.
I'll take the briefcase.

1219
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:13,202
The children and I are heading
that way on an errand.

1220
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:14,686
We'll stop
by the bank afterwards.

1221
01:05:14,840 --> 01:05:16,763
I'll give you a lift.
My rounds are done.

1222
01:05:17,360 --> 01:05:18,441
Wonderful.

1223
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:20,404
All aboard, everyone. Come on.

1224
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:22,170
On the bicycle?

1225
01:05:22,320 --> 01:05:24,322
But there are five of us.
We can't all fit.

1226
01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:26,329
The weight
on those wheels alone.

1227
01:05:26,520 --> 01:05:28,010
Mary Poppins,
how much do you weigh?

1228
01:05:28,520 --> 01:05:29,885
Never you mind about that.

1229
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:31,724
It's all a question
of balance.

1230
01:05:32,320 --> 01:05:33,970
- Annabel here.
- Whoa!

1231
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,128
- And then John.
- Whoa!

1232
01:05:37,360 --> 01:05:39,124
Sit up straight!
You're not flour bags.

1233
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:41,089
- Georgie at the front.
- Yay!

1234
01:05:41,600 --> 01:05:43,489
- Mary Poppins, you here.

1235
01:05:43,560 --> 01:05:44,686
- I've got it!
- Blimey!

1236
01:05:44,760 --> 01:05:46,125
All right, everybody.

1237
01:05:46,280 --> 01:05:48,123
Primed and ready,
Mr. Binnacle?

1238
01:05:48,280 --> 01:05:49,770
Ready and charged, sir.

1239
01:05:49,960 --> 01:05:51,644
- Ready, everyone?
- Ready!

1240
01:05:51,840 --> 01:05:53,126
Are you sure
this is quite safe?

1241
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:54,770
Not in the slightest.
Ready.

1242
01:05:54,840 --> 01:05:55,841
Three!

1243
01:05:55,920 --> 01:05:56,921
Two !

1244
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:58,445
Steady;
'One!

1245
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:00,245
- Fire!
- Go!

1246
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:31,643
Now, pull over, right ahead.
Thank you, Jack.

1247
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:38,368
Right. Off we go, jiggity-jog.

1248
01:06:39,040 --> 01:06:40,121
Thank you, Georgie.

1249
01:06:42,760 --> 01:06:43,921
This way, please.

1250
01:06:53,560 --> 01:06:55,642
Never noticed
this alley before.

1251
01:06:55,800 --> 01:06:57,086
Well, clearly you've never had

1252
01:06:57,200 --> 01:06:59,362
a Royal Doulton bowl
that wanted mending.

1253
01:07:00,200 --> 01:07:01,440
Straight ahead.

1254
01:07:05,640 --> 01:07:06,641
Here we are.

1255
01:07:08,560 --> 01:07:11,928
"Topotrepolovsky's
all repairs,

1256
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:13,604
"large and small fix-it shop."

1257
01:07:13,800 --> 01:07:15,848
Looks as though it's just
a small fix-it shop today.

1258
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:17,161
That's just what we want.

1259
01:07:17,240 --> 01:07:19,402
The bowl only needs
a small fix, after all.

1260
01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:22,881
So now my head
is a door knocker.

1261
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:26,327
I suppose my beak might be
useful for opening cans.

1262
01:07:26,520 --> 01:07:28,887
You fuss, fuss, fuss.
Don't be so dramatic.

1263
01:07:34,080 --> 01:07:35,764
Cousin Topsy!

1264
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:38,563
Mary Poppins!

1265
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:41,371
For the love
of all that is holy...

1266
01:07:41,560 --> 01:07:42,971
do not come in!

1267
01:07:43,160 --> 01:07:44,605
Don't be so rude!

1268
01:07:44,760 --> 01:07:46,888
Please stay away.

1269
01:07:47,080 --> 01:07:49,765
- It is Second Wednesday!

1270
01:07:49,840 --> 01:07:52,810
Second Wednesday. Dear.
I'd forgotten.

1271
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:56,604
Still, today or never,
that's my motto.

1272
01:07:59,240 --> 01:08:00,526
There we are!

1273
01:08:05,800 --> 01:08:06,926
Follow me.

1274
01:08:09,720 --> 01:08:11,643
So, in you come.

1275
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:14,890
You do not listen to Topsy.

1276
01:08:18,360 --> 01:08:20,010
No!

1277
01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:22,282
It has begun!

1278
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:35,771
Now, what do you want?

1279
01:08:35,960 --> 01:08:37,200
You have guests, cousin.

1280
01:08:37,280 --> 01:08:39,248
You might at least greet them
at the door.

1281
01:08:39,400 --> 01:08:41,084
And how am I to do that,
please,

1282
01:08:41,160 --> 01:08:44,130
when I am down here,
up on the ceiling?

1283
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:46,688
Very well,
we'll come to you.

1284
01:08:46,920 --> 01:08:48,763
Excuse me, please, Georgie.

1285
01:08:48,920 --> 01:08:50,490
Now, this way.

1286
01:08:50,840 --> 01:08:53,525
Be careful on the way up.

1287
01:08:53,680 --> 01:08:54,966
Why be careful?

1288
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:57,885
Leave it all for Topsy to fix.

1289
01:08:58,040 --> 01:09:00,884
Climb on my shelves.
Step on the toys.

1290
01:09:02,200 --> 01:09:05,568
Kick the little china dolls
in their faces.

1291
01:09:05,720 --> 01:09:08,246
John, Annabel,
Georgie and Jack...

1292
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:09,526
this is my cousin.

1293
01:09:09,680 --> 01:09:12,445
Second cousin,
many times removed.

1294
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:15,490
Tatiana Antanasia
Cositori Topotrepolovsky.

1295
01:09:15,640 --> 01:09:18,644
But you may call me Topsy.

1296
01:09:19,680 --> 01:09:21,011
That's an unusual accent
you've got there.

1297
01:09:21,080 --> 01:09:22,081
Where are you from?

1298
01:09:22,160 --> 01:09:23,605
That's very
interesting story...

1299
01:09:23,720 --> 01:09:25,085
We have no idea.

1300
01:09:25,240 --> 01:09:26,969
We need you
to fix this bowl, dear.

1301
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:29,964
No,no,no.
It is as I have told to you...

1302
01:09:30,120 --> 01:09:31,804
second Wednesday
of the month...

1303
01:09:31,880 --> 01:09:34,360
when everything
is turning turtle.

1304
01:09:34,480 --> 01:09:35,811
- "Turning turtle"?

1305
01:09:35,960 --> 01:09:37,485
What exactly does that mean?

1306
01:09:37,640 --> 01:09:40,962
It means my whole world
goes flippity-flop

1307
01:09:41,040 --> 01:09:42,724
like a turtle on his back.

1308
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:44,882
And I don't know
my up from my down,

1309
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:46,041
my east from my west.

1310
01:09:46,240 --> 01:09:48,971
- My topsy from my bottomsy.

1311
01:09:49,080 --> 01:09:51,401
Yes, I think
we've all grasped the concept.

1312
01:09:51,560 --> 01:09:53,528
Good. That's quick for you.

1313
01:09:53,680 --> 01:09:57,241
You see, my littles,
anything I try to fix...

1314
01:09:57,400 --> 01:10:00,131
on Second Wednesday
goes kerflooey.

1315
01:10:00,280 --> 01:10:02,009
Kerflooey.

1316
01:10:02,160 --> 01:10:03,321
- Kerflooey!

1317
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:05,561
Please, cousin,
you have always said

1318
01:10:05,680 --> 01:10:06,781
that you can fix anything.

1319
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:09,486
Sweet girl,
you tell Mary Poppins,

1320
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:10,886
who doesn't listen...

1321
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:12,565
that any other day,

1322
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:15,928
Tatiana Antanasia Cositori
Topotrepolovsky...

1323
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:18,003
can fix anything.

1324
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:22,605
<i>If you ring
with something broken</i>

1325
01:10:22,680 --> 01:10:24,842
<i>On a Thursday</i>

1326
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:30,040
<i>I'll make new with my glue,
pins and thread</i>

1327
01:10:30,240 --> 01:10:33,130
<i>What you bring,
when I've awoken</i>

1328
01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:35,441
<i>On a Friday</i>

1329
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:40,288
<i>I will mend, and then spend
the day in bed</i>

1330
01:10:40,440 --> 01:10:42,920
<i>Children, Saturn, Sun,
and Mondays</i>

1331
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,048
<i>Are just
everything-is-fun days</i>

1332
01:10:45,200 --> 01:10:48,522
<i>But in the second week,
I wear a frown</i>

1333
01:10:48,720 --> 01:10:52,008
<i>For I know
that after Tuesday</i>

1334
01:10:52,080 --> 01:10:54,242
<i>Comes the
Topsy-gets-bad-news day</i>

1335
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:57,051
<i>It's the dreaded
Second Wednesday</i>

1336
01:10:57,200 --> 01:11:02,570
<i>When from nine to noon
my life turns upside down</i>

1337
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:11,048
<i>Fast is slow, low is high
Stop is go and that is why</i>

1338
01:11:11,240 --> 01:11:13,402
<i>Every Second Wednesday
is a hurdle</i>

1339
01:11:14,360 --> 01:11:16,124
<i>From eight to nine
all is well</i>

1340
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:17,884
<i>Then I roll over
on my shell</i>

1341
01:11:18,080 --> 01:11:20,606
<i>And all because
the world is turning turtle</i>

1342
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:24,646
<i>Now day is night, dog is cat
Black is white, thin is fat</i>

1343
01:11:24,840 --> 01:11:27,764
<i>That is why
I'm loosening up my girdle</i>

1344
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:29,809
<i>I cannot help
this charming troupe</i>

1345
01:11:29,880 --> 01:11:31,450
<i>Don't mock me
'cause I'm in the soup</i>

1346
01:11:31,640 --> 01:11:34,564
<i>And why? Because the world
is turning turtle</i>

1347
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:38,089
<i>Woe is me
I'm as opposite as I can be</i>

1348
01:11:38,240 --> 01:11:41,608
<i>I long for Thursdays
when the world is drab</i>

1349
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:43,205
<i>When will it cease?</i>

1350
01:11:43,280 --> 01:11:45,169
<i>Now my life resembles
War and Peace</i>

1351
01:11:45,360 --> 01:11:47,283
<i>That Tolstoy certainly
had the gift of gab</i>

1352
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:48,691
<i>I couldn't get through it</i>

1353
01:11:48,840 --> 01:11:50,444
<i>Bottom's top, yin is yang</i>

1354
01:11:50,520 --> 01:11:52,170
<i>Peace and quiet's
sturm und drang</i>

1355
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:55,449
<i>Tuesday nights,
my blood begins to curdle</i>

1356
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:57,250
<i>East is west, in is out</i>

1357
01:11:57,320 --> 01:11:58,810
<i>And that is why
I need to shout</i>

1358
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:03,005
<i>"No! The world
is turning turtle!"</i>

1359
01:12:07,640 --> 01:12:09,961
<i>If you had come
some other morn</i>

1360
01:12:10,040 --> 01:12:11,883
<i>You wouldn't have found me
so forlorn</i>

1361
01:12:12,040 --> 01:12:13,565
<i>But since the day
that I was born</i>

1362
01:12:13,680 --> 01:12:15,444
<i>Second Wednesdays
is on the fritz</i>

1363
01:12:15,640 --> 01:12:17,324
<i>I couldn't mend this
to save my soul</i>

1364
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:19,323
<i>If this keeps up,
I'll dig a hole</i>

1365
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:22,490
<i>You say life's a cherry bowl
But Wednesday's full of pits</i>

1366
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:24,130
<i>Tell us,
can you fix this drum?</i>

1367
01:12:24,280 --> 01:12:26,089
<i>Well,
today is looking glum</i>

1368
01:12:26,240 --> 01:12:28,447
<i>- Can you mend this crack?
-And broken string?</i>

1369
01:12:28,600 --> 01:12:30,409
<i>Well, perhaps
if you all lend a hand</i>

1370
01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:32,289
<i>Our fingers
are at your command</i>

1371
01:12:32,440 --> 01:12:34,408
<i>A broken songbird
still can sing</i>

1372
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:36,210
<i>Let's do the turtle swing</i>

1373
01:13:08,240 --> 01:13:10,720
<i>Woe is me
Now I'm on my head</i>

1374
01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:11,881
<i>How can that be?</i>

1375
01:13:12,040 --> 01:13:14,281
<i>Well, you say "woe"
but I say "lucky you"</i>

1376
01:13:14,440 --> 01:13:15,521
<i>- Lucky me?
-Yes</i>

1377
01:13:15,680 --> 01:13:16,727
<i>Here, on your head</i>

1378
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:19,087
<i>"A" is far behind
and led by "Z"</i>

1379
01:13:19,240 --> 01:13:22,084
<i>It's good to get
a different point of view</i>

1380
01:13:23,120 --> 01:13:24,565
I love your shoes.

1381
01:13:25,200 --> 01:13:27,726
You see, when the world turns
upside down...

1382
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:30,321
the best thing is
to turn right along with it.

1383
01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:32,371
I do see!

1384
01:13:32,520 --> 01:13:35,330
From down here,
things look right side up!

1385
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:38,864
I wouldn't mind seeing things
from that angle.

1386
01:13:38,920 --> 01:13:40,365
- Sounds like fun!
- Can we?

1387
01:13:40,760 --> 01:13:42,842
Very well. Flippity-flop.

1388
01:13:46,520 --> 01:13:47,567
<i>- Near is
-Far is</i>

1389
01:13:47,640 --> 01:13:48,641
<i>- Here is
-There</i>

1390
01:13:48,720 --> 01:13:50,165
<i>Turtles turning everywhere</i>

1391
01:13:50,360 --> 01:13:51,521
<i>Things are getting clear</i>

1392
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:53,728
<i>Well, knock on wood,
my dear</i>

1393
01:13:55,200 --> 01:13:58,363
<i>When you change the view
from where you stood</i>

1394
01:13:58,520 --> 01:14:01,888
<i>The things you view
will change for good</i>

1395
01:14:03,720 --> 01:14:05,290
<i>I never thought of things
that way</i>

1396
01:14:05,440 --> 01:14:07,283
<i>She never thought of things
that way</i>

1397
01:14:07,440 --> 01:14:08,965
<i>Now Wednesdays
are my favourite day</i>

1398
01:14:09,120 --> 01:14:11,282
<i>Now Wednesdays
are her favourite day</i>

1399
01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:13,090
<i>'Cause that's the day
I'm quite contrary</i>

1400
01:14:13,160 --> 01:14:14,844
<i>And now,
thanks to Cousin</i> Mary

1401
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,526
<i>I have changed, to be exact
I love the fact</i>

1402
01:14:17,720 --> 01:14:20,326
<i>The world is
turning turtle</i>

1403
01:14:20,480 --> 01:14:24,963
<i>Turtle</i>

1404
01:14:31,440 --> 01:14:34,762
Come, give your bowl to me.

1405
01:14:34,840 --> 01:14:38,083
No more am I afraid
with this new point of view.

1406
01:14:38,280 --> 01:14:39,327
Good.

1407
01:14:39,400 --> 01:14:41,448
Excuse me,
but do you have any idea

1408
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:42,881
how much our bowl
might be worth?

1409
01:14:43,320 --> 01:14:44,560
In money?

1410
01:14:44,840 --> 01:14:46,683
Not very much, I'm afraid.

1411
01:14:46,840 --> 01:14:49,525
But that doesn't make it
any less beautiful.

1412
01:14:50,200 --> 01:14:52,567
Our mother always said
it was priceless.

1413
01:14:53,040 --> 01:14:56,886
Well, I'm sure it was to her.

1414
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:03,565
Mary Poppins is right,
for once.

1415
01:15:03,720 --> 01:15:06,485
It is all in the way
that you look at things.

1416
01:15:07,280 --> 01:15:09,248
Thank you, cousin.

1417
01:15:09,440 --> 01:15:11,110
Now, come along, children.
Get your hats.

1418
01:15:11,400 --> 01:15:14,449
And don't you worry
about Mother's bowl.

1419
01:15:14,600 --> 01:15:17,683
I will fix
and make perfect for you.

1420
01:15:18,120 --> 01:15:21,010
So you come back, maybe,
next Second Wednesday?

1421
01:15:21,200 --> 01:15:22,725
Yes. Spit spot.

1422
01:15:23,720 --> 01:15:26,166
Nice meeting you, Topsy Turvy.

1423
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:29,041
"Topsy Turvy'

1424
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:32,444
I like. It's catchy.

1425
01:15:35,840 --> 01:15:36,887
Now, what do we do?

1426
01:15:37,040 --> 01:15:38,280
I have no idea.

1427
01:15:38,440 --> 01:15:40,010
Well, like Topsy said...

1428
01:15:40,160 --> 01:15:42,731
maybe we should start
looking at things differently.

1429
01:15:45,240 --> 01:15:46,241
Marvellous.

1430
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:47,481
It looks like
things are starting

1431
01:15:47,560 --> 01:15:49,369
to turn around for my cousin.

1432
01:15:56,400 --> 01:15:57,401
Mary Poppins,

1433
01:15:57,480 --> 01:15:58,925
this is not
the quickest way to the bank.

1434
01:15:59,080 --> 01:16:00,445
It is today.

1435
01:16:00,640 --> 01:16:02,085
Look, there's Aunt Jane!

1436
01:16:02,280 --> 01:16:04,328
Aunt Jane! Aunt Jane!

1437
01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:05,401
Hello!

1438
01:16:05,480 --> 01:16:06,641
Off to the rally,
are you, Jane?

1439
01:16:06,720 --> 01:16:08,643
Yes. All still here,
thank goodness.

1440
01:16:08,720 --> 01:16:09,881
- Nobody fell off.

1441
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:11,923
Say, I could come back and
give you a hand with all that

1442
01:16:12,080 --> 01:16:13,525
once I drop the others
at the bank.

1443
01:16:13,680 --> 01:16:16,206
No, please don't worry.
I'm perfectly fine. Really.

1444
01:16:16,360 --> 01:16:17,885
Nonsense. The bank's
just around the corner...

1445
01:16:18,040 --> 01:16:19,041
and the children and I have

1446
01:16:19,120 --> 01:16:20,246
plenty of legs
to get us there.

1447
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:23,324
Now, climb off, everyone.
Ready, and jump.

1448
01:16:23,480 --> 01:16:24,891
Steady the bicycle for me,
would you, children?

1449
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:26,041
You're sure
you don't mind, Jack?

1450
01:16:26,120 --> 01:16:27,167
'Course not.

1451
01:16:27,240 --> 01:16:29,049
I was hoping to drop by
that rally of yours, anyway.

1452
01:16:29,280 --> 01:16:31,089
You were? Good.

1453
01:16:31,240 --> 01:16:32,730
You can ride
in the front basket.

1454
01:16:33,760 --> 01:16:34,761
Really?

1455
01:16:34,920 --> 01:16:36,206
I think she'll be better here.

1456
01:16:36,320 --> 01:16:37,321
Here, is it?

1457
01:16:37,520 --> 01:16:39,363
- Yeah. Up you go.
- Now, where should I hold on?

1458
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:40,760
Handlebars are fine.

1459
01:16:40,920 --> 01:16:42,684
- Ready?
- Yes! Ready as I'll ever...

1460
01:16:46,080 --> 01:16:47,684
My goodness!

1461
01:16:49,640 --> 01:16:51,369
Now, be careful here, 'cause
there are cars crossing!

1462
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:52,521
That's all right.
They'll see us.

1463
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:02,200
Right, that's enough.

1464
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:08,564
Step along, children.

1465
01:17:15,400 --> 01:17:16,890
There must be
someone at this bank

1466
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:18,485
who could help us
save our house.

1467
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:19,926
I'm sure
Father's already asked.

1468
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:21,366
Well, we haven't.

1469
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:22,521
Maybe we could get them

1470
01:17:22,600 --> 01:17:23,931
to see things
from a new point of view.

1471
01:17:24,080 --> 01:17:25,923
Sit over there,
please, children.

1472
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:27,201
Good afternoon.

1473
01:17:27,280 --> 01:17:28,327
I'd like to see Mr. Michael...

1474
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:29,925
I'll need a signature
for those, sir.

1475
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:32,409
Of course.
Excuse me a moment.

1476
01:17:32,560 --> 01:17:33,607
Well!

1477
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:40,849
We mustn't be late
for Mr. Wilkins.

1478
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:46,244
What did you do that for?

1479
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:47,890
You hurt his feelings.

1480
01:17:48,040 --> 01:17:50,008
You do know who those men are,
don't you, Georgie?

1481
01:17:50,160 --> 01:17:52,208
Yes. They're the lawyers.

1482
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:54,040
He's the nice one.

1483
01:17:54,480 --> 01:17:56,960
Maybe we could convince him
to help us.

1484
01:17:57,640 --> 01:17:59,130
Worth a try.

1485
01:17:59,400 --> 01:18:01,687
Today or never,
that's my motto.

1486
01:18:04,960 --> 01:18:06,200
Come on!

1487
01:18:14,720 --> 01:18:16,529
Now, how can I help you?

1488
01:18:16,680 --> 01:18:19,286
Finally. I'd like to see
Mr. Michael Banks, please.

1489
01:18:22,680 --> 01:18:23,886
Hello. Operator.

1490
01:18:27,560 --> 01:18:30,040
- May we go in?
- He's expecting you.

1491
01:18:36,200 --> 01:18:38,202
Is there something I can do
for you, children?

1492
01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:41,008
May I have a sweet, please?

1493
01:18:43,560 --> 01:18:44,891
Yes, of course you can, dear.

1494
01:18:45,040 --> 01:18:46,087
-- You all can.

1495
01:18:46,200 --> 01:18:47,247
ls in foreclosure.

1496
01:18:47,320 --> 01:18:49,448
Mr. Michael Banks,
17 Cherry Tree Lane.

1497
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:50,806
In foreclosure.

1498
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:53,167
How many repossessions,
so far, this month?

1499
01:18:53,320 --> 01:18:55,641
19, sir. And we have
nearly that amount

1500
01:18:55,720 --> 01:18:57,529
scheduled for next week alone.

1501
01:18:57,680 --> 01:18:58,920
Who'd have thought this slump

1502
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:00,331
would be so good
for business?

1503
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:02,130
I wonder, Mr. Wilkins,
if, perhaps...

1504
01:19:02,280 --> 01:19:04,169
as Michael Banks
is an employee,

1505
01:19:04,240 --> 01:19:06,004
you might consider
giving him a few more weeks.

1506
01:19:06,160 --> 01:19:07,605
And lose our chance
to get that house?

1507
01:19:08,160 --> 01:19:09,161
I mean...

1508
01:19:09,320 --> 01:19:11,482
I don't like to lose,
Mr. Frye.

1509
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:18,047
<i>Didn't I ask
for more tea, Miss Farthing?</i>

1510
01:19:18,200 --> 01:19:20,282
Yes, sir. Right away,
Mr. Wilkins.

1511
01:19:22,280 --> 01:19:24,601
Why don't you all
help yourselves?

1512
01:19:26,720 --> 01:19:27,767
Come on.

1513
01:19:28,680 --> 01:19:31,684
"Office of the Bank Chairman."
We can't go in there.

1514
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:34,403
I'm running
a business, not a charity.

1515
01:19:34,560 --> 01:19:35,891
It's just that, Well...

1516
01:19:36,080 --> 01:19:37,081
his family has suffered

1517
01:19:37,160 --> 01:19:38,491
tremendous hardship
this past year...

1518
01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:41,405
You are not giving
Banks one more second...

1519
01:19:41,560 --> 01:19:43,289
to pay off that loan.

1520
01:19:43,440 --> 01:19:45,204
Do I make myself clear?

1521
01:19:45,360 --> 01:19:46,600
Look.

1522
01:19:46,680 --> 01:19:47,761
It's the wolf.

1523
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:49,524
In two days,
Banks will be out

1524
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:51,125
on that street
and the house...

1525
01:19:51,800 --> 01:19:52,801
will be ours.

1526
01:19:53,840 --> 01:19:54,841
Georgie, no!

1527
01:19:54,920 --> 01:19:57,685
You can't steal our house.
I'm telling my father!

1528
01:19:58,000 --> 01:19:59,001
Steal your...?

1529
01:19:59,160 --> 01:20:00,161
Who are you?

1530
01:20:00,320 --> 01:20:01,651
These are the Banks children.

1531
01:20:02,520 --> 01:20:03,521
Are they?

1532
01:20:04,840 --> 01:20:06,365
Come here, boy,
I think you might have...

1533
01:20:06,440 --> 01:20:07,521
- Let's go, Georgie!
- Run!

1534
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:09,250
Close that door,
Miss Farthing!

1535
01:20:13,400 --> 01:20:14,401
Fool!

1536
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:15,766
Stop them.

1537
01:20:26,680 --> 01:20:27,966
There you are,
Michael.

1538
01:20:28,120 --> 01:20:29,451
The children and I brought you
your briefcase.

1539
01:20:29,520 --> 01:20:30,521
Thank you.

1540
01:20:30,600 --> 01:20:32,011
- You're welcome.
- Where are the children?

1541
01:20:32,160 --> 01:20:33,969
Father!
Father! Father!

1542
01:20:34,120 --> 01:20:35,360
- Help!
- Wait!

1543
01:20:35,520 --> 01:20:36,601
What is it?
What's happened?

1544
01:20:36,760 --> 01:20:38,728
He's the wolf
trying to steal our house!

1545
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:40,211
What on earth
are you talking about?

1546
01:20:40,360 --> 01:20:41,930
I'm afraid
your children

1547
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,162
burst into my office
just now, Banks.

1548
01:20:44,480 --> 01:20:45,527
What?

1549
01:20:45,680 --> 01:20:46,886
I was just seeing if anything
could be done

1550
01:20:46,960 --> 01:20:48,405
about extending your loan...

1551
01:20:48,560 --> 01:20:49,846
when they came in claiming

1552
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:51,888
I was trying
to steal your house.

1553
01:20:51,960 --> 01:20:52,961
He is! We heard him!

1554
01:20:53,040 --> 01:20:54,246
Mr. Wilkins
is trying to help us!

1555
01:20:54,320 --> 01:20:55,367
But then,
why was he chasing us?

1556
01:20:55,520 --> 01:20:57,124
I just thought they might
stop running around

1557
01:20:57,200 --> 01:20:59,407
and making a scene
if I offered them some sweets.

1558
01:20:59,560 --> 01:21:01,244
I'm so sorry, Mr. Wilkins.

1559
01:21:02,160 --> 01:21:03,650
See it doesn't happen again.

1560
01:21:04,240 --> 01:21:07,084
After all, you don't
want your father...

1561
01:21:07,320 --> 01:21:10,847
losing his position
on account of you, do you?

1562
01:21:12,320 --> 01:21:14,084
I know time is
running short, Banks...

1563
01:21:14,240 --> 01:21:16,208
but I want you to have
every chance

1564
01:21:16,280 --> 01:21:17,327
of paying off that loan.

1565
01:21:17,680 --> 01:21:19,682
So, I will make sure
that I'm in my office

1566
01:21:19,760 --> 01:21:20,841
on Friday evening...

1567
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:22,650
until the last stroke
of midnight.

1568
01:21:22,720 --> 01:21:23,721
You have my word.

1569
01:21:23,880 --> 01:21:25,769
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

1570
01:21:26,360 --> 01:21:27,361
Gentlemen?

1571
01:21:32,280 --> 01:21:33,281
But, Father,
he really did do it.

1572
01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:34,566
Not another word!

1573
01:21:36,240 --> 01:21:37,651
- Take them home this instant!
- Yes, sir.

1574
01:21:37,800 --> 01:21:39,848
We'll discuss this
when I get back!

1575
01:21:40,120 --> 01:21:41,645
Come along, children.

1576
01:21:51,880 --> 01:21:53,325
Now we've done it,
haven't we?

1577
01:21:53,480 --> 01:21:54,970
I don't think
I've ever seen Father

1578
01:21:55,040 --> 01:21:56,246
that upset with us before.

1579
01:21:56,400 --> 01:21:57,765
But we were
telling the truth!

1580
01:21:57,920 --> 01:21:59,285
That doesn't matter,
Georgie.

1581
01:21:59,440 --> 01:22:00,566
We got him into trouble.

1582
01:22:00,720 --> 01:22:03,041
And he doesn't even know
that we broke Mother's bowl.

1583
01:22:03,200 --> 01:22:05,771
Everything we've tried to fix,
we've only made it worse.

1584
01:22:33,400 --> 01:22:35,084
Which way do we go,
Mary Poppins?

1585
01:22:35,240 --> 01:22:36,685
Now,
why would you ask me?

1586
01:22:36,840 --> 01:22:38,842
The three of you are leading
the way, after all.

1587
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:40,081
- Us?
- But we were...

1588
01:22:40,240 --> 01:22:41,890
Walking around in a fog.

1589
01:22:42,040 --> 01:22:45,328
No, we weren't. I mean,
we are in a fog, but...

1590
01:22:45,520 --> 01:22:46,601
We were only talking.

1591
01:22:46,760 --> 01:22:48,649
Yes, too focused
on where you've been

1592
01:22:48,720 --> 01:22:49,881
to pay attention
to where you're going.

1593
01:22:50,040 --> 01:22:51,485
But Father told us
to go straight home!

1594
01:22:51,640 --> 01:22:52,687
He'll be furious
if we're late.

1595
01:22:52,840 --> 01:22:55,047
Not much to be done
about that now, is there?

1596
01:22:55,240 --> 01:22:56,730
Are we lost, then?

1597
01:22:56,880 --> 01:22:58,405
That would depend
on where you want to go.

1598
01:22:58,480 --> 01:22:59,481
Jack!

1599
01:22:59,560 --> 01:23:00,561
At your service.

1600
01:23:00,720 --> 01:23:02,688
Say, what's with
all the glum faces?

1601
01:23:02,840 --> 01:23:04,683
Lost sixpence
and found a penny?

1602
01:23:04,760 --> 01:23:05,807
We've made a mess
of everything.

1603
01:23:05,880 --> 01:23:06,881
Father's furious with us.

1604
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,571
And we can't find
our way home.

1605
01:23:09,720 --> 01:23:10,881
Lost?

1606
01:23:11,040 --> 01:23:12,280
Are you, Mary Poppins?

1607
01:23:13,120 --> 01:23:14,610
Hopelessly.

1608
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:17,603
Well, now, I'm no expert...

1609
01:23:17,800 --> 01:23:19,245
but if ever I lose my way,

1610
01:23:19,320 --> 01:23:21,721
I just look for a little light
to guide me.

1611
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:27,685
<i>Let's say
you're lost</i>

1612
01:23:27,760 --> 01:23:30,240
<i>In a park, sure</i>

1613
01:23:30,440 --> 01:23:34,445
<i>You can give in
to the dark, or</i>

1614
01:23:35,360 --> 01:23:39,570
<i>You can trip a little light
fantastic with me</i>

1615
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:44,163
<i>When you're alone
in your room</i>

1616
01:23:44,320 --> 01:23:47,324
<i>Your choice is just
embrace the gloom</i>

1617
01:23:47,480 --> 01:23:52,611
<i>Or you can trip a little
light fantastic with me</i>

1618
01:23:53,640 --> 01:23:56,769
<i>For if you hide
under the covers</i>

1619
01:23:56,920 --> 01:23:59,321
<i>You might
never see the day</i>

1620
01:23:59,480 --> 01:24:02,723
<i>But if a spark can start
inside your heart</i>

1621
01:24:02,880 --> 01:24:04,370
<i>Then you can always
find the way</i>

1622
01:24:04,720 --> 01:24:07,291
<i>So when life
is getting' dreary</i>

1623
01:24:07,440 --> 01:24:09,807
<i>Just pretend
that you're a leerie</i>

1624
01:24:09,960 --> 01:24:13,806
<i>As you trip a little
light fantastic with me</i>

1625
01:24:13,960 --> 01:24:15,007
What's a leerie?

1626
01:24:15,160 --> 01:24:17,481
Why, it's what we lamplighters
call ourselves, of course.

1627
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,002
Time to send up
the call to arms.

1628
01:24:20,200 --> 01:24:23,841
Leeries, trip the light
to lead the way!

1629
01:24:25,880 --> 01:24:28,724
<i>Now, when you're stuck
in the mist, sure</i>

1630
01:24:28,880 --> 01:24:30,962
<i>You can struggle
and resist, or</i>

1631
01:24:31,120 --> 01:24:34,442
<i>You can trip a little
light fantastic with me</i>

1632
01:24:35,040 --> 01:24:37,771
<i>Now, say you're lost
in the crowd, well</i>

1633
01:24:37,920 --> 01:24:40,002
<i>You can stamp
and scream out loud, or</i>

1634
01:24:40,160 --> 01:24:43,562
<i>You can trip a little
light fantastic with me</i>

1635
01:24:44,040 --> 01:24:45,804
<i>And when the fog
comes rolling' in</i>

1636
01:24:45,960 --> 01:24:48,566
<i>Just keep your feet
upon the path</i>

1637
01:24:48,720 --> 01:24:51,166
<i>Mustn't mope and frown
Or worse, lie down</i>

1638
01:24:51,320 --> 01:24:53,004
<i>Don't let it be
your epitaph</i>

1639
01:24:53,160 --> 01:24:55,447
<i>So, when life
is getting' scary</i>

1640
01:24:55,600 --> 01:24:57,568
<i>Be your own illuminary</i>

1641
01:24:57,720 --> 01:25:01,406
<i>Who can shine their light
for all the world to see</i>

1642
01:25:01,560 --> 01:25:05,406
<i>As you trip a little
light fantastic with me</i>

1643
01:25:07,920 --> 01:25:09,046
- Hello.
- Hello.

1644
01:25:09,200 --> 01:25:10,201
Thank you!

1645
01:25:10,840 --> 01:25:12,683
<i>A leerie
loves the edge of night</i>

1646
01:25:12,840 --> 01:25:14,763
<i>Though dim, to him,
the world looks bright</i>

1647
01:25:14,960 --> 01:25:16,849
<i>He's got the gift
of second sight</i>

1648
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:18,729
<i>To trip</i>
a <i>little light fantastic!</i>

1649
01:25:18,920 --> 01:25:20,922
<i>A leerie's job's
to light the way</i>

1650
01:25:21,080 --> 01:25:22,889
<i>To take the night
and make it day!</i>

1651
01:25:23,040 --> 01:25:24,963
<i>We mimic the Moon
Yes, that's our aim</i>

1652
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:27,487
<i>For we're
the keepers of the flame!</i>

1653
01:25:29,800 --> 01:25:32,087
<i>And if you're deep
inside a tunnel</i>

1654
01:25:32,160 --> 01:25:34,208
<i>And there is
no end in sight</i>

1655
01:25:34,360 --> 01:25:36,647
<i>Well, just carry on
until the dawn</i>

1656
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:39,167
<i>It's darkest
right before the light</i>

1657
01:25:42,080 --> 01:25:43,081
Now what do we do?

1658
01:25:43,280 --> 01:25:44,520
Well, just as Jack said...

1659
01:25:44,680 --> 01:25:46,091
we follow the light.

1660
01:26:20,160 --> 01:26:22,606
<i>As you trip
a little light fantastic</i>

1661
01:26:22,760 --> 01:26:24,808
<i>Won't you trip
a little light fantastic?</i>

1662
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:25,881
<i>Come on</i>

1663
01:26:25,960 --> 01:26:28,440
<i>Trip a little
light fantastic with me</i>

1664
01:28:20,560 --> 01:28:21,561
Come along!

1665
01:28:21,720 --> 01:28:23,529
Join us in a bit
of kick and prance.

1666
01:28:23,880 --> 01:28:24,961
What did he say?

1667
01:28:25,120 --> 01:28:27,930
"Kick and prance," it means
"dance." It's leerie speak.

1668
01:28:28,080 --> 01:28:29,241
You don't say
the word you mean,

1669
01:28:29,320 --> 01:28:30,685
you say something
that rhymes, only...

1670
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:32,490
Here, I'll show you
how it works.

1671
01:28:32,640 --> 01:28:34,529
Angus, give us
your weep and wail.

1672
01:28:34,840 --> 01:28:36,410
To the rest of you,
that means "tale."

1673
01:28:36,480 --> 01:28:37,481
<i>I was short of a sheet</i>

1674
01:28:37,560 --> 01:28:38,561
<i>He was in the street</i>

1675
01:28:38,640 --> 01:28:39,641
<i>Just to tumble
down the sink</i>

1676
01:28:39,720 --> 01:28:40,721
<i>Just to get himself
a drink</i>

1677
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:41,801
<i>Then I pinched
what's fatter</i>

1678
01:28:41,920 --> 01:28:42,921
<i>He grabbed his ladder</i>

1679
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:44,729
<i>- To smile and smirk</i>
<i>- To work!</i>

1680
01:28:45,280 --> 01:28:46,406
There's nothing to it.

1681
01:28:46,560 --> 01:28:48,130
Can you speak leerie,
Mary Poppins?

1682
01:28:48,280 --> 01:28:49,566
Can I speak leerie?

1683
01:28:49,760 --> 01:28:51,808
Of course she can.
She's Mary Poppins!

1684
01:28:51,960 --> 01:28:54,008
- Can we do it with you?
- Please?

1685
01:28:54,160 --> 01:28:55,969
Very well then.

1686
01:28:56,120 --> 01:28:57,724
<i>JACK'. Children,
tell us your sorry tale</i>

1687
01:28:58,440 --> 01:29:00,090
<i>Give us your weep
and wail!</i>

1688
01:29:00,240 --> 01:29:02,083
<i>- Well, we had this bowl
-Rabbit in the hole</i>

1689
01:29:02,240 --> 01:29:04,083
<i>- That fell and broke
-Bicycle spoke</i>

1690
01:29:04,240 --> 01:29:05,844
<i>- So we took it to a shop
-Like a lollipop</i>

1691
01:29:05,920 --> 01:29:06,967
<i>And went upside down!</i>

1692
01:29:07,040 --> 01:29:08,041
<i>That's a circus clown</i>

1693
01:29:08,120 --> 01:29:09,929
<i>- Then went to the bank
-Rattle and clank</i>

1694
01:29:10,080 --> 01:29:11,605
<i>- Got lost in the fog
-Lump on a log</i>

1695
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:12,681
<i>Till we found our friend</i>

1696
01:29:12,760 --> 01:29:13,807
<i>To stand and defend</i>

1697
01:29:13,960 --> 01:29:15,644
<i>- Who took us on a trip
-Snap a horse's whip</i>

1698
01:29:15,800 --> 01:29:17,848
<i>And we tripped
a little light fantastic!</i>

1699
01:29:18,040 --> 01:29:19,690
<i>Now, that sounds
a little bit bombastic</i>

1700
01:29:19,760 --> 01:29:20,761
<i>But they tripped the light</i>

1701
01:29:20,840 --> 01:29:21,887
<i>We tripped the light</i>

1702
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,162
<i>Let's trip
a little light fantastic!</i>

1703
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:47,525
<i>Join us,</i> Mary <i>Poppins!</i>

1704
01:30:56,240 --> 01:30:57,241
You've got it!

1705
01:30:57,400 --> 01:30:59,368
Now let's get you
all back home!

1706
01:30:59,720 --> 01:31:02,963
<i>Now, if your life
is getting' foggy</i>

1707
01:31:03,120 --> 01:31:05,043
<i>That's no reason
to complain</i>

1708
01:31:05,200 --> 01:31:07,931
<i>There's so much in store
inside the door</i>

1709
01:31:08,080 --> 01:31:10,242
<i>Of 17 Cherry Tree Lane!</i>

1710
01:31:14,360 --> 01:31:16,408
<i>So when troubles
are incessant</i>

1711
01:31:16,480 --> 01:31:18,687
<i>Simply be
more incandescent</i>

1712
01:31:18,840 --> 01:31:22,287
<i>For your light comes with
a lifetime guarantee</i>

1713
01:31:22,560 --> 01:31:23,561
<i>As you</i>

1714
01:31:23,640 --> 01:31:25,085
<i>Trip a little
light fantastic</i>

1715
01:31:25,160 --> 01:31:26,161
<i>Won't you</i>

1716
01:31:26,240 --> 01:31:27,366
<i>Trip a little
light fantastic</i>

1717
01:31:27,440 --> 01:31:28,441
<i>Come on!</i>

1718
01:31:28,520 --> 01:31:29,885
<i>Trip a little
light fantastic</i>

1719
01:31:31,520 --> 01:31:32,521
<i>With me!</i>

1720
01:31:32,600 --> 01:31:33,647
<i>Went to the bank,
rattle and clank</i>

1721
01:31:33,720 --> 01:31:35,085
<i>Met with the boss
Pitch and toss</i>

1722
01:31:35,240 --> 01:31:36,969
<i>Got lost in the fog
Lump on a log</i>

1723
01:31:37,120 --> 01:31:39,691
<i>Trip a little
light fantastic!</i>

1724
01:31:41,480 --> 01:31:43,209
<i>Trip</i> a <i>little light fantastic!</i>

1725
01:31:43,360 --> 01:31:44,771
<i>Trip a little
light fantastic!</i>

1726
01:31:45,360 --> 01:31:47,124
<i>Trip a little
light fantastic!</i>

1727
01:31:47,280 --> 01:31:48,770
Where on earth
have you all been?

1728
01:31:51,040 --> 01:31:52,405
I told you to bring them
straight home.

1729
01:31:52,480 --> 01:31:53,561
I've been worried sick!

1730
01:31:53,720 --> 01:31:54,767
We're sorry
we're late, Father.

1731
01:31:54,840 --> 01:31:56,205
It wasn't Mary Poppins' fault.

1732
01:31:56,400 --> 01:31:57,731
We got lost in the fog.

1733
01:31:57,880 --> 01:32:00,724
Jack and the leeries led us
down the frog and toad.

1734
01:32:00,880 --> 01:32:02,484
He means road.

1735
01:32:02,640 --> 01:32:04,404
So you've been off filling
the children's heads

1736
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:05,527
with stuff and nonsense.

1737
01:32:06,040 --> 01:32:08,520
I've heard quite enough.
Come in at once!

1738
01:32:08,680 --> 01:32:09,966
Best to take my leave.
Good night, Mary Poppins.

1739
01:32:10,040 --> 01:32:11,041
Good night, Jack.

1740
01:32:11,120 --> 01:32:12,121
Into the parlour, go on.

1741
01:32:13,840 --> 01:32:14,841
Go on.

1742
01:32:19,040 --> 01:32:21,122
Don't be too hard on 'em, sir.

1743
01:32:21,280 --> 01:32:22,964
They're only children,
after all.

1744
01:32:23,120 --> 01:32:24,849
I know they're children,
my children,

1745
01:32:24,920 --> 01:32:26,410
and I will deal with them
as I see fit.

1746
01:32:26,600 --> 01:32:28,329
- Now leave us to it.
- Yes, sir.

1747
01:32:28,840 --> 01:32:30,171
Not you, Mary Poppins.
In here.

1748
01:32:31,120 --> 01:32:32,281
Very well, sir.

1749
01:32:41,440 --> 01:32:43,568
You could have lost me my job.

1750
01:32:44,760 --> 01:32:45,807
Do you understand that?

1751
01:32:46,920 --> 01:32:49,685
Have you any idea
how difficult it is to find

1752
01:32:49,760 --> 01:32:51,489
a good position like mine
these days?

1753
01:32:52,160 --> 01:32:54,401
But there you all were,
tearing about like a...

1754
01:32:54,800 --> 01:32:55,847
And you, Mary Poppins,

1755
01:32:55,920 --> 01:32:58,605
I thought you were here
to look after these children.

1756
01:32:58,800 --> 01:33:01,565
It wasn't her doing,
it was me.

1757
01:33:01,760 --> 01:33:03,524
No, it was us.

1758
01:33:04,040 --> 01:33:06,327
We thought maybe
if we talked to Mr. Frye...

1759
01:33:06,480 --> 01:33:08,244
he could give you more time
to save the house.

1760
01:33:08,400 --> 01:33:09,686
We were only trying to help.

1761
01:33:09,840 --> 01:33:11,080
Well, you didn't help!

1762
01:33:12,160 --> 01:33:13,161
Now...

1763
01:33:13,800 --> 01:33:16,565
I know it's been a hard year
for our family...

1764
01:33:16,720 --> 01:33:18,609
and I've done all I can...

1765
01:33:18,760 --> 01:33:21,001
to keep you all from worrying,
but I can't do this on my own.

1766
01:33:21,160 --> 01:33:22,685
It's too hard. I just...

1767
01:33:23,920 --> 01:33:25,331
I'm barely holding it together
as it is.

1768
01:33:25,480 --> 01:33:27,721
I can't even seem to remember
my briefcase in the morning...

1769
01:33:27,800 --> 01:33:28,801
and there's no more time,

1770
01:33:28,880 --> 01:33:30,041
we're about to lose
our home...

1771
01:33:30,120 --> 01:33:32,407
and I can't lose this house.
I just can't.

1772
01:33:34,200 --> 01:33:35,326
I don't know what to do.

1773
01:33:35,400 --> 01:33:37,129
I'm sorry,
I don't know what to do.

1774
01:33:40,960 --> 01:33:43,566
Everything's fallen to pieces
since your mother...

1775
01:33:55,240 --> 01:33:57,720
Haven't we lost
enough already?

1776
01:34:02,120 --> 01:34:04,043
We haven't lost Mother.

1777
01:34:04,600 --> 01:34:06,284
Not really.

1778
01:34:09,240 --> 01:34:15,646
<i>Nothing is gone
forever, only out of place</i>

1779
01:34:16,360 --> 01:34:22,606
<i>So when we need her touch
and loving gaze</i>

1780
01:34:23,320 --> 01:34:29,248
<i>"Gone but not forgotten"
is the perfect phrase</i>

1781
01:34:29,400 --> 01:34:35,328
<i>Smiling from a star
that she makes glow</i>

1782
01:34:35,840 --> 01:34:39,083
<i>Trust she's always there</i>

1783
01:34:39,240 --> 01:34:42,608
<i>Watching as we grow</i>

1784
01:34:42,760 --> 01:34:45,127
<i>Find her in the place</i>

1785
01:34:45,320 --> 01:34:51,487
<i>Where the lost things go</i>

1786
01:34:58,120 --> 01:35:00,043
When did you all
get so clever?

1787
01:35:00,960 --> 01:35:03,088
Last night,
Mary Poppins told us...

1788
01:35:07,160 --> 01:35:09,401
I hope I'm as clever as you
when I grow up.

1789
01:35:11,040 --> 01:35:13,088
You're right.

1790
01:35:13,240 --> 01:35:15,163
Of course, you're right,
Georgie.

1791
01:35:16,120 --> 01:35:18,726
Your mother's not gone.
She's in your smile.

1792
01:35:20,800 --> 01:35:22,802
And in your walk, John...

1793
01:35:23,080 --> 01:35:25,162
and Annabel's eyes.

1794
01:35:26,120 --> 01:35:29,727
And she'll always be with us
wherever we go.

1795
01:35:35,880 --> 01:35:36,961
Love you.

1796
01:35:37,480 --> 01:35:40,768
Now, run along, wash your
hands, get ready for dinner.

1797
01:35:47,480 --> 01:35:48,481
Did you have something
to do with them

1798
01:35:48,560 --> 01:35:49,561
trying to save the house?

1799
01:35:51,320 --> 01:35:52,970
I never said a word.

1800
01:35:53,120 --> 01:35:54,929
It was
all the children's idea.

1801
01:35:56,800 --> 01:35:58,425
The whole time
I've been looking after them,

1802
01:35:58,440 --> 01:35:59,587
they've been looking after me.

1803
01:35:59,640 --> 01:36:01,005
I had it all backward.

1804
01:36:01,160 --> 01:36:02,889
A Banks family trait.

1805
01:36:04,200 --> 01:36:05,884
What was I thinking?

1806
01:36:08,080 --> 01:36:10,924
Some people think
a great deal too much.

1807
01:36:11,480 --> 01:36:13,289
Of that I'm certain.

1808
01:37:16,040 --> 01:37:17,963
Here, Jane.
Let me help you with that.

1809
01:37:18,120 --> 01:37:19,167
Thank you.

1810
01:37:20,080 --> 01:37:21,241
No luck?

1811
01:37:21,720 --> 01:37:23,848
We can look through
everything again if you like.

1812
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,765
No. No, there's no point.
It's nearly midnight.

1813
01:37:27,080 --> 01:37:29,765
We tried our best, but
thank you, Jack, so much...

1814
01:37:29,920 --> 01:37:32,890
and thanks to all your friends
for helping us. Thank you.

1815
01:37:33,040 --> 01:37:34,087
Of course.

1816
01:37:34,200 --> 01:37:35,201
Anything for you.

1817
01:37:36,840 --> 01:37:38,365
We'll be out in a moment.

1818
01:38:11,400 --> 01:38:12,401
The children
have packed up

1819
01:38:12,480 --> 01:38:13,845
the last of their things
themselves.

1820
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:15,650
Well done, everyone.

1821
01:38:15,800 --> 01:38:17,290
All right,
have you got Gillie?

1822
01:38:17,360 --> 01:38:18,361
Yes, Father.

1823
01:38:18,440 --> 01:38:19,487
Good, good.

1824
01:38:19,560 --> 01:38:21,369
Good riddance
to that old kitchen.

1825
01:38:21,520 --> 01:38:23,329
Never could figure out
that stove.

1826
01:38:24,560 --> 01:38:25,766
All right, Well...

1827
01:38:25,960 --> 01:38:28,531
we've spent every last moment
that we can here.

1828
01:38:28,680 --> 01:38:30,808
It's time to say goodbye.

1829
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:34,445
Goodbye, old friend!

1830
01:38:34,600 --> 01:38:37,251
Goodbye, old friend!

1831
01:38:46,120 --> 01:38:47,929
- <i>Thank you.</i>
- <i>Thank you.</i>

1832
01:38:48,080 --> 01:38:50,526
- Hello, Willoughby.
- Miss Lark. Admiral.

1833
01:38:53,640 --> 01:38:55,449
What are you all
doing here so late?

1834
01:38:55,600 --> 01:38:57,409
We've been waiting'
to see you off, sir.

1835
01:38:57,560 --> 01:38:59,005
We'd be here no matter
what the hour.

1836
01:38:59,200 --> 01:39:00,725
If you or your family

1837
01:39:00,800 --> 01:39:02,165
should ever need
a place to stay...

1838
01:39:02,360 --> 01:39:04,727
Willoughby and I would be
happy for the company.

1839
01:39:04,880 --> 01:39:06,245
That's very kind of you,
Miss Lark.

1840
01:39:06,320 --> 01:39:07,845
Jane's offered to put us up
in her flat...

1841
01:39:08,040 --> 01:39:09,121
at least for the time being.

1842
01:39:09,280 --> 01:39:11,362
No, forever,
for as long as you'd like.

1843
01:39:11,600 --> 01:39:13,045
I wish you'd come
with us, Ellen.

1844
01:39:13,200 --> 01:39:14,611
Don't you worry about me.

1845
01:39:14,800 --> 01:39:17,371
I got a nice room fixed up
at my sister's.

1846
01:39:17,840 --> 01:39:19,490
You won't leave us,
will you, Mary Poppins?

1847
01:39:19,960 --> 01:39:21,007
Don't be silly.

1848
01:39:21,160 --> 01:39:23,367
She says she's not leaving
until the door opens.

1849
01:39:23,560 --> 01:39:25,164
In any case,
your home is with us.

1850
01:39:25,880 --> 01:39:27,962
I'm pleased she got caught
on your string, Georgie.

1851
01:39:28,120 --> 01:39:29,121
My kite!

1852
01:39:29,200 --> 01:39:30,201
I forgot my kite!

1853
01:39:30,400 --> 01:39:31,970
Very well,
but be quick about it.

1854
01:39:32,120 --> 01:39:33,485
The Admiral's got something

1855
01:39:33,560 --> 01:39:35,801
he would like to give you,
Mr. Banks, sir.

1856
01:39:36,240 --> 01:39:40,370
<i>The H. M.</i> S. <i>Glad Tidings,</i>
I <i>commanded her myself.</i>

1857
01:39:40,520 --> 01:39:43,524
May she guide you
safely into port.

1858
01:39:43,680 --> 01:39:45,205
Thank you very much, Admiral.

1859
01:39:45,640 --> 01:39:47,483
I will take
very good care of her.

1860
01:39:48,160 --> 01:39:50,925
Eight bells, Mr. Binnacle,
time to man our posts!

1861
01:39:51,080 --> 01:39:52,844
Yes, sir.
Goodbye, Mr. Banks, sir.

1862
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:54,365
- Bye. Bye.
- Goodbye, Binnacle.

1863
01:39:54,440 --> 01:39:55,646
- I found it!
- Bye, Miss Lark.

1864
01:39:55,760 --> 01:39:56,761
Bye, Willoughby.

1865
01:39:56,840 --> 01:39:59,366
I'm not sure that's gonna
get off the ground anymore.

1866
01:39:59,520 --> 01:40:01,522
It looks more glue than kite.

1867
01:40:01,720 --> 01:40:02,767
Georgie...

1868
01:40:02,920 --> 01:40:05,082
did you patch this up
with one of my old drawings?

1869
01:40:05,760 --> 01:40:08,081
It looks like you've done
a fine job, there.

1870
01:40:08,400 --> 01:40:09,447
Look.

1871
01:40:09,520 --> 01:40:10,806
Can you see?

1872
01:40:11,280 --> 01:40:13,601
That's all of us together...

1873
01:40:13,880 --> 01:40:15,723
in front of the...

1874
01:40:18,680 --> 01:40:20,489
- What is it, Father?
- Wait.

1875
01:40:25,800 --> 01:40:27,211
"Certificate of shares"!

1876
01:40:27,360 --> 01:40:28,666
This is it. This is what
we've been looking for!

1877
01:40:28,720 --> 01:40:29,846
Yes! Yes!

1878
01:40:30,040 --> 01:40:31,530
We need
to get to the bank!

1879
01:40:31,840 --> 01:40:32,966
What's the time? Anyone?

1880
01:40:33,120 --> 01:40:34,121
Um, seven minutes to midnight.

1881
01:40:34,200 --> 01:40:35,247
Seven minutes?
It's not enough time.

1882
01:40:35,320 --> 01:40:36,546
We need to be at the bank
by midnight.

1883
01:40:36,600 --> 01:40:37,940
- Take the van.
- No, it's no good.

1884
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:39,306
You still wouldn't
make it in time.

1885
01:40:39,360 --> 01:40:40,441
Well, what can we do?

1886
01:40:40,600 --> 01:40:42,170
Nothing.
We can't turn back time.

1887
01:40:42,320 --> 01:40:43,367
Why not?

1888
01:40:43,880 --> 01:40:45,166
Everything is possible.

1889
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:47,445
Even the impossible.

1890
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:49,843
Can we do that,
Mary Poppins?

1891
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:51,525
Can we turn back time?

1892
01:40:52,560 --> 01:40:54,881
Well, I don't see why
that couldn't be arranged.

1893
01:40:54,960 --> 01:40:57,088
-- But that's ridiculous.

1894
01:40:57,280 --> 01:40:58,964
Indeed it is, Michael.
It's nonsense.

1895
01:40:59,040 --> 01:41:00,041
Foolishness!

1896
01:41:00,240 --> 01:41:02,368
It makes no sense!
And if it makes no sense...

1897
01:41:02,520 --> 01:41:03,726
it can't be true!

1898
01:41:03,880 --> 01:41:04,961
What are you
all talking about?

1899
01:41:05,040 --> 01:41:06,087
Never you mind about that.

1900
01:41:06,160 --> 01:41:07,207
You just get that kite
to the bank...

1901
01:41:07,280 --> 01:41:09,169
as fast as possible,
and leave the rest to us.

1902
01:41:09,320 --> 01:41:10,810
- How will you...
- Go!

1903
01:41:10,880 --> 01:41:12,006
Now, we'll need
a lot of help, Jack.

1904
01:41:12,080 --> 01:41:13,081
Good as done!

1905
01:41:13,160 --> 01:41:14,625
- Go and gather the leeries!
- Right.

1906
01:41:14,680 --> 01:41:16,170
Children, help me
ready the bicycle.

1907
01:41:16,320 --> 01:41:18,548
I'll take the reins this time.
Speed is of the essence.

1908
01:41:18,600 --> 01:41:20,762
Have you ever ridden
a bicycle like this before?

1909
01:41:20,920 --> 01:41:23,366
Please. How different can
it be from riding an elephant?

1910
01:41:30,920 --> 01:41:33,730
- Ready, and up!

1911
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:35,968
Now, all we have to do
is turn back time.

1912
01:41:41,520 --> 01:41:42,965
This is fun!

1913
01:42:23,960 --> 01:42:26,725
A very good week's work,
gentlemen.

1914
01:42:26,880 --> 01:42:28,120
Thank you, sir.

1915
01:42:28,280 --> 01:42:31,568
It look as if Banks won't be
joining us tonight.

1916
01:42:31,720 --> 01:42:33,185
He does have
a few more minutes, sir.

1917
01:42:33,240 --> 01:42:35,607
You said you'd wait until
the last stroke of midnight.

1918
01:42:35,760 --> 01:42:37,125
Yes, I know that!

1919
01:42:37,960 --> 01:42:39,325
So we wait.

1920
01:42:40,080 --> 01:42:42,686
I'm a man of my word.

1921
01:42:50,400 --> 01:42:51,606
How much time do we have?

1922
01:42:51,680 --> 01:42:54,206
Um, there's only
five minutes left, I think.

1923
01:43:04,240 --> 01:43:06,481
Good. Now over
to the tower, boys!

1924
01:43:08,240 --> 01:43:10,129
Sorry, this is as far
as you go.

1925
01:43:10,280 --> 01:43:11,850
Back in a flash.

1926
01:43:24,480 --> 01:43:26,130
- Come on!
- Come on, lads!

1927
01:43:34,720 --> 01:43:35,881
Ladder

1928
01:43:36,040 --> 01:43:37,041
Jack!

1929
01:43:59,040 --> 01:44:00,451
- Ladder!
- Ladder!

1930
01:44:00,600 --> 01:44:01,965
- Ladder!
- Ladder!

1931
01:44:16,640 --> 01:44:17,926
No, I can't watch!

1932
01:44:25,200 --> 01:44:27,567
I mean, you would think
they'd never done this before.

1933
01:44:40,160 --> 01:44:41,730
What are we gonna do?

1934
01:44:43,520 --> 01:44:45,363
I've got an idea! Come on!

1935
01:45:12,360 --> 01:45:13,361
Now!

1936
01:45:18,880 --> 01:45:20,769
Yay!

1937
01:45:40,960 --> 01:45:43,042
Jack! You can turn
the time back now!

1938
01:45:43,480 --> 01:45:45,801
How? I can't reach the hands!

1939
01:45:46,120 --> 01:45:48,168
Honestly.

1940
01:45:48,360 --> 01:45:49,407
They better hurry.

1941
01:45:49,560 --> 01:45:51,642
We have less than
a minute to go.

1942
01:45:55,480 --> 01:45:57,005
We're too late, Jack!

1943
01:45:57,200 --> 01:45:58,929
There's got to be a way!

1944
01:45:59,880 --> 01:46:00,881
Look!

1945
01:46:22,480 --> 01:46:26,883
And three,
two, one...

1946
01:46:29,760 --> 01:46:31,649
Why hasn't Big Ben chimed?

1947
01:46:31,800 --> 01:46:32,881
Perhaps your watch
is running fast.

1948
01:46:33,040 --> 01:46:35,281
Don't be a simpleton,
my watch never runs fast.

1949
01:46:38,200 --> 01:46:40,123
Big Ben's gone dark.

1950
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:44,764
Relight the clock,
Jack, quickly.

1951
01:46:50,720 --> 01:46:53,405
Look. They've relit Big Ben.

1952
01:46:53,560 --> 01:46:55,085
But that time is wrong.

1953
01:46:55,240 --> 01:46:57,368
The clock must have stopped.

1954
01:47:05,600 --> 01:47:06,840
That's Banks.

1955
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:08,047
He's made it in time!

1956
01:47:08,200 --> 01:47:09,611
Not yet he hasn't. Get down
there and make sure...

1957
01:47:09,760 --> 01:47:12,127
he doesn't get inside until
that blasted clock strikes 12.

1958
01:47:12,320 --> 01:47:14,641
- But, sir...
- Now, Mr. Frye!

1959
01:47:27,200 --> 01:47:29,328
Lock it, Mr. Frye!

1960
01:47:33,080 --> 01:47:34,081
Hello!

1961
01:47:34,240 --> 01:47:35,765
Hello!
Let us in, please!

1962
01:47:35,920 --> 01:47:37,081
Please, let us in!

1963
01:47:37,240 --> 01:47:38,480
JANE; Hello?

1964
01:47:38,680 --> 01:47:40,091
Hello?

1965
01:47:40,240 --> 01:47:41,321
- Jane.
- What?

1966
01:47:41,480 --> 01:47:42,811
Let's...

1967
01:47:43,120 --> 01:47:44,929
Let's go fly a kite.

1968
01:47:46,960 --> 01:47:48,291
There it is!
It's the one with the light.

1969
01:47:48,480 --> 01:47:50,289
The first one? Okay.

1970
01:47:50,480 --> 01:47:51,845
You run. I'll unspool.

1971
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:53,525
Yes, quickly!

1972
01:47:58,280 --> 01:47:59,281
Come on!

1973
01:47:59,440 --> 01:48:00,441
Come on!

1974
01:48:00,600 --> 01:48:02,284
Hello!

1975
01:48:06,760 --> 01:48:09,730
It won't work.
He's never gonna see it.

1976
01:48:24,680 --> 01:48:26,250
- Let's get in.
- Yes, let's go!

1977
01:48:31,120 --> 01:48:32,326
- Let us in, please!

1978
01:48:32,440 --> 01:48:34,030
Please let us in!
We need to get inside!

1979
01:48:35,200 --> 01:48:37,089
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

1980
01:48:37,600 --> 01:48:39,125
Hurry, Mr. Banks!

1981
01:48:39,320 --> 01:48:40,321
What?

1982
01:48:46,520 --> 01:48:47,931
What is all this?

1983
01:48:48,360 --> 01:48:50,044
It's what
we've been looking for.

1984
01:48:52,760 --> 01:48:55,650
Three, two, one...

1985
01:48:55,840 --> 01:48:56,841
fire!

1986
01:49:01,440 --> 01:49:02,965
Mr. Binnacle...

1987
01:49:05,720 --> 01:49:09,088
Big Ben has
finally got it right.

1988
01:49:16,080 --> 01:49:17,161
<i>And this goes...</i>

1989
01:49:17,920 --> 01:49:19,251
at the top.

1990
01:49:21,040 --> 01:49:23,042
What's that?
Where did this go?

1991
01:49:23,240 --> 01:49:24,241
- Right there?
- No.

1992
01:49:24,400 --> 01:49:25,925
- No, there.
- This piece goes there.

1993
01:49:26,120 --> 01:49:27,824
And does it matter that
it's all cut up in bits?

1994
01:49:27,880 --> 01:49:28,981
It's still worth something,
is it?

1995
01:49:29,080 --> 01:49:31,269
It's still valid, so long as
all the pieces are there.

1996
01:49:31,480 --> 01:49:32,686
Is that so?

1997
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:36,128
Now, Georgie, there was one
more piece, a corner piece...

1998
01:49:36,200 --> 01:49:37,281
with a lot of signatures
on it.

1999
01:49:37,360 --> 01:49:38,361
Do you remember that?

2000
01:49:38,840 --> 01:49:42,083
I must have thrown it out.
I'm sorry, Father.

2001
01:49:42,440 --> 01:49:44,408
that's all right, Georgie.

2002
01:49:44,560 --> 01:49:45,766
No, it isn't.

2003
01:49:48,320 --> 01:49:50,800
I'm afraid you have
a problem, Banks.

2004
01:49:51,320 --> 01:49:52,731
You see,
without those signatures,

2005
01:49:52,800 --> 01:49:54,245
you have no bank shares...

2006
01:49:55,520 --> 01:49:56,681
no house...

2007
01:49:57,760 --> 01:49:59,285
you have nothing.

2008
01:49:59,440 --> 01:50:00,441
What?

2009
01:50:00,520 --> 01:50:02,284
But he knows you have
the bank shares!

2010
01:50:02,440 --> 01:50:04,044
He's been planning this
all along!

2011
01:50:04,240 --> 01:50:05,571
Take your children
out of here, Banks.

2012
01:50:05,640 --> 01:50:06,841
I've had enough of their lies.

2013
01:50:07,800 --> 01:50:09,564
Don't you dare
insult my children.

2014
01:50:10,920 --> 01:50:12,888
- Don't you dare.

2015
01:50:13,080 --> 01:50:14,605
They are not lying,
and you know it!

2016
01:50:16,120 --> 01:50:18,168
I only wish I'd believed
them sooner!

2017
01:50:18,320 --> 01:50:20,971
You all had him pegged right
from the start, didn't you?

2018
01:50:21,040 --> 01:50:22,087
Come on.

2019
01:50:23,080 --> 01:50:24,764
Take the house!

2020
01:50:24,920 --> 01:50:26,206
Go ahead.

2021
01:50:26,360 --> 01:50:27,885
I have everything
I need right here.

2022
01:50:34,040 --> 01:50:35,849
He has you there, Willie.

2023
01:50:36,560 --> 01:50:38,085
Uncle Dawes?

2024
01:50:38,720 --> 01:50:40,882
What on earth
are you doing here?

2025
01:50:41,040 --> 01:50:43,725
A little bird told me...

2026
01:50:44,320 --> 01:50:46,891
that you've been trying
to cheat the Banks family...

2027
01:50:47,040 --> 01:50:48,769
out of their shares
in this bank.

2028
01:50:48,920 --> 01:50:50,684
That he has. We heard him.

2029
01:50:51,040 --> 01:50:52,690
I also hear...

2030
01:50:52,840 --> 01:50:54,968
you've been telling
the whole of London

2031
01:50:55,040 --> 01:50:57,008
that I've gone loony.

2032
01:50:57,320 --> 01:50:58,810
The only loony thing
I ever did

2033
01:50:58,920 --> 01:51:00,604
was trust you
to look after this bank!

2034
01:51:00,760 --> 01:51:01,841
You can't be serious,

2035
01:51:01,920 --> 01:51:03,410
I've nearly doubled
the profits of this bank.

2036
01:51:03,560 --> 01:51:07,087
Yes, by wringing it out of
the customers' pockets.

2037
01:51:07,240 --> 01:51:10,084
Their trust in us
built this bank.

2038
01:51:10,240 --> 01:51:14,006
You've squandered every
last bit of their goodwill.

2039
01:51:14,160 --> 01:51:15,400
Well, Willie...

2040
01:51:16,560 --> 01:51:18,403
I'm back, and you're out.

2041
01:51:19,920 --> 01:51:22,400
Gentlemen, would you show
my nephew to the door, please?

2042
01:51:22,560 --> 01:51:24,050
Yes, sir, Mr. Dawes.

2043
01:51:24,200 --> 01:51:26,009
Get off!

2044
01:51:27,480 --> 01:51:29,403
You're not fit
to run this bank!

2045
01:51:31,800 --> 01:51:34,121
We'll see about that!

2046
01:51:34,280 --> 01:51:36,487
I may be circling the drain...

2047
01:51:36,640 --> 01:51:39,291
but I got a few steps
left in me.

2048
01:51:39,640 --> 01:51:43,167
<i>So, when they
tell you that you're finished</i>

2049
01:51:43,360 --> 01:51:45,840
<i>And your chance
to dance is done</i>

2050
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:48,731
<i>That's the time to stand
To strike up the band</i>

2051
01:51:48,880 --> 01:51:50,882
<i>And tell 'em that
you've just begun</i>

2052
01:51:51,040 --> 01:51:53,281
<i>So when life's
a real pea-souper</i>

2053
01:51:53,440 --> 01:51:55,522
<i>You must choose
to be a trouper</i>

2054
01:51:55,680 --> 01:51:59,082
<i>For your light comes
with a lifetime guarantee</i>

2055
01:51:59,320 --> 01:52:00,481
<i>As you</i>

2056
01:52:07,760 --> 01:52:08,761
<i>With me!</i>

2057
01:52:08,840 --> 01:52:10,171
<i>Went to the bank,
rattle and clank</i>

2058
01:52:10,320 --> 01:52:11,765
<i>Met with the boss
Pitch and toss</i>

2059
01:52:11,920 --> 01:52:13,729
<i>Got lost in the fog
Lump on a log</i>

2060
01:52:13,800 --> 01:52:15,882
<i>- Trip a little
-Trip a little</i>

2061
01:52:15,960 --> 01:52:17,007
<i>Trip a little light fantastic!</i>

2062
01:52:17,080 --> 01:52:18,081
<i>Light fantastic!</i>

2063
01:52:21,760 --> 01:52:23,683
John, would you get
the feet off the...

2064
01:52:23,880 --> 01:52:25,484
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

2065
01:52:26,320 --> 01:52:28,243
So glad to have you back,
Mr. Dawes.

2066
01:52:28,320 --> 01:52:30,527
Thank you, Michael.

2067
01:52:30,720 --> 01:52:33,200
By the way,
those shares of yours...

2068
01:52:33,360 --> 01:52:34,964
perfectly fine...

2069
01:52:35,120 --> 01:52:36,690
save 'em for your family.

2070
01:52:36,840 --> 01:52:38,604
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

2071
01:52:39,600 --> 01:52:42,046
I'd like to tell you
a little story.

2072
01:52:43,280 --> 01:52:45,009
Once upon a time...

2073
01:52:45,160 --> 01:52:48,164
there was a man
with a wooden leg...

2074
01:52:50,240 --> 01:52:52,561
That's not it.

2075
01:52:53,600 --> 01:52:56,285
It's about a little boy
named Michael.

2076
01:52:56,440 --> 01:52:59,569
Michael wanted to give his
tuppence to a bird lady...

2077
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:04,322
but after
a little persuasion?

2078
01:53:04,480 --> 01:53:07,450
He decided he'd give 'em
to his father.

2079
01:53:07,600 --> 01:53:10,729
Michael's father,
your grandfather...

2080
01:53:10,880 --> 01:53:13,167
gave those tuppence
to this bank...

2081
01:53:13,320 --> 01:53:16,210
and told us to guard it well.

2082
01:53:16,760 --> 01:53:18,250
We did just that.

2083
01:53:18,840 --> 01:53:22,003
And after several quite
clever investments...

2084
01:53:22,160 --> 01:53:23,924
if I do say so myself...

2085
01:53:24,800 --> 01:53:28,521
that tuppence has grown
into quite a tidy sum.

2086
01:53:28,760 --> 01:53:29,966
Really?

2087
01:53:30,360 --> 01:53:31,566
Really, Michael.

2088
01:53:31,720 --> 01:53:35,441
In fact, enough
to pay off that loan you took.

2089
01:53:37,840 --> 01:53:40,605
- The house is yours.

2090
01:54:08,160 --> 01:54:10,401
What a beautiful day
to be going back home.

2091
01:54:10,560 --> 01:54:12,528
Look at them
lovely cherry blossoms.

2092
01:54:12,680 --> 01:54:14,409
They're lovely.

2093
01:54:14,560 --> 01:54:16,449
I shall have to paint them.

2094
01:54:17,200 --> 01:54:18,440
What about you, Jane?

2095
01:54:18,600 --> 01:54:19,806
What about me?

2096
01:54:19,960 --> 01:54:21,086
He means what about you

2097
01:54:21,160 --> 01:54:23,083
and that handsome
lamplighter, Jack?

2098
01:54:23,240 --> 01:54:25,163
No! No, we're just friends.

2099
01:54:25,320 --> 01:54:26,321
- Go on.
- Really.

2100
01:54:26,480 --> 01:54:27,811
Stop it, Ellen!

2101
01:54:27,920 --> 01:54:29,570
What's this?

2102
01:54:30,080 --> 01:54:32,321
The Spring Fair, it's today!
Can we go?

2103
01:54:32,480 --> 01:54:33,481
Please?

2104
01:54:33,640 --> 01:54:34,687
I don't see why not.

2105
01:54:34,840 --> 01:54:35,841
Hooray!

2106
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:37,001
Come on, Father, let's go!

2107
01:54:37,080 --> 01:54:38,241
Will you go
on the Ferris wheel with us?

2108
01:54:38,320 --> 01:54:39,560
Yes.
And you too, Jane!

2109
01:54:39,720 --> 01:54:41,404
Only if you come
with me, Ellen.

2110
01:54:41,600 --> 01:54:43,921
What? Wouldn't be
caught dead on that thing.

2111
01:54:56,400 --> 01:54:58,323
Follow me! Follow me!

2112
01:55:00,320 --> 01:55:02,448
All right, all right.
My turn, my turn.

2113
01:55:02,600 --> 01:55:04,364
- Let's see it.
- I've got it.

2114
01:55:08,240 --> 01:55:09,890
Come ride
the Ferris wheel!

2115
01:55:09,960 --> 01:55:11,371
Come ride the Ferris wheel!

2116
01:55:12,680 --> 01:55:14,045
- Georgie!
- Georgie!

2117
01:55:14,120 --> 01:55:16,202
- Slow down!
- Race you!

2118
01:55:17,120 --> 01:55:18,326
Lollipops!

2119
01:55:18,680 --> 01:55:20,682
Look at
the Ferris wheel!

2120
01:55:20,840 --> 01:55:22,365
The ponies!

2121
01:55:24,200 --> 01:55:28,285
<i>Life's</i> a <i>balloon
that tumbles or rises</i>

2122
01:55:28,480 --> 01:55:32,007
<i>Depending on what is inside</i>

2123
01:55:33,200 --> 01:55:37,364
<i>Fill it with hope
and playful surprises</i>

2124
01:55:37,520 --> 01:55:42,321
<i>And, dearie ducks,
then you're in for a ride</i>

2125
01:55:42,480 --> 01:55:45,484
<i>Look inside the balloon</i>

2126
01:55:45,640 --> 01:55:47,768
<i>And if you hear a tune</i>

2127
01:55:47,960 --> 01:55:50,964
<i>There's nowhere to go but up</i>

2128
01:55:51,040 --> 01:55:52,451
May we have balloons?

2129
01:55:53,320 --> 01:55:55,561
Yes, of course, we can.
Let's go.

2130
01:55:56,320 --> 01:55:58,800
<i>Choose the secret we know</i>

2131
01:55:58,960 --> 01:56:01,201
<i>Before life makes us grow</i>

2132
01:56:01,360 --> 01:56:04,807
<i>There's nowhere to go but up</i>

2133
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:07,001
Hello, we would like

2134
01:56:07,080 --> 01:56:09,162
some of your
very finest balloons, please.

2135
01:56:09,320 --> 01:56:10,651
That you shall have.

2136
01:56:10,800 --> 01:56:12,848
But choose carefully,
my dearie ducks.

2137
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:15,128
Many have chosen
the wrong balloon.

2138
01:56:15,880 --> 01:56:19,202
Be sure to choose the one
that's right for you.

2139
01:56:19,360 --> 01:56:20,600
Which balloon
would you like, Georgie?

2140
01:56:20,680 --> 01:56:23,126
- Um...
- Why don't you go first, sir?

2141
01:56:23,280 --> 01:56:24,281
Me?

2142
01:56:24,440 --> 01:56:25,930
Those days are long behind me.

2143
01:56:26,120 --> 01:56:28,441
I don't think I've held
a balloon since I was a child.

2144
01:56:28,600 --> 01:56:30,443
Then you've forgotten
what it's like.

2145
01:56:30,840 --> 01:56:32,080
To hold a balloon?

2146
01:56:32,520 --> 01:56:34,682
To be a child!

2147
01:56:36,200 --> 01:56:38,931
<i>If your selection feels right</i>

2148
01:56:39,080 --> 01:56:41,082
<i>Well, then, dearie, hold tight</i>

2149
01:56:41,240 --> 01:56:45,325
<i>If you see your reflection
your heart will take flight</i>

2150
01:56:45,480 --> 01:56:47,847
<i>If you pick the right string</i>

2151
01:56:47,920 --> 01:56:49,809
<i>Then your heart will take wing</i>

2152
01:56:49,960 --> 01:56:53,487
<i>And there's nowhere to go
but up</i>

2153
01:57:04,280 --> 01:57:05,930
on!

2154
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:07,206
Father.

2155
01:57:09,120 --> 01:57:14,604
<i>Now I feel like
that boy with</i> a <i>shiny new toy</i>

2156
01:57:14,760 --> 01:57:17,411
<i>And there's nowhere to go
but up</i>

2157
01:57:17,560 --> 01:57:18,561
Michael!

2158
01:57:18,640 --> 01:57:21,928
<i>Just one day at the fair
has me Waltzing on air</i>

2159
01:57:22,280 --> 01:57:25,523
<i>And there's nowhere to go
but up</i>

2160
01:57:25,720 --> 01:57:27,848
Jane, I remember!

2161
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:29,161
It's all true!

2162
01:57:29,320 --> 01:57:32,483
Every impossible thing we
imagined with Mary Poppins...

2163
01:57:32,640 --> 01:57:34,165
it all happened!

2164
01:57:34,320 --> 01:57:36,607
<i>Now my heart is so light</i>

2165
01:57:36,680 --> 01:57:38,569
<i>That I think I just might</i>

2166
01:57:38,720 --> 01:57:42,281
<i>Start feeding the birds
and then go fly a kite!</i>

2167
01:57:42,440 --> 01:57:46,206
<i>With your head in a cloud
Only laughter's allowed</i>

2168
01:57:46,360 --> 01:57:48,931
<i>And there's nowhere to go
but up!</i>

2169
01:57:49,120 --> 01:57:50,121
Father!

2170
01:57:50,200 --> 01:57:51,711
You've got to choose
your own balloons.

2171
01:57:51,760 --> 01:57:53,922
What balloon
are you going to have?

2172
01:57:54,080 --> 01:57:55,286
This one.

2173
01:57:55,360 --> 01:57:57,169
I'm going in the air!

2174
01:58:03,360 --> 01:58:05,249
<i>We're zigging and zagging</i>

2175
01:58:05,320 --> 01:58:07,129
<i>Our feet never dragging</i>

2176
01:58:07,280 --> 01:58:10,250
<i>We might take a ride
to the Moon</i>

2177
01:58:10,400 --> 01:58:14,291
<i>All this bobbing and weaving
all comes from believing</i>

2178
01:58:14,480 --> 01:58:18,326
<i>The magic inside the balloon</i>

2179
01:58:18,480 --> 01:58:20,369
<i>The past is the past</i>

2180
01:58:20,440 --> 01:58:22,363
<i>It lives on as history</i>

2181
01:58:22,520 --> 01:58:25,251
<i>And that's an important thing</i>

2182
01:58:25,880 --> 01:58:29,805
<i>The future comes fast
Each second a mystery</i>

2183
01:58:29,960 --> 01:58:34,170
<i>For nobody knows
what tomorrow may bring</i>

2184
01:58:35,360 --> 01:58:37,010
This one looks like you.

2185
01:58:37,480 --> 01:58:38,766
How do you know?

2186
01:58:47,720 --> 01:58:49,768
Don't you lose her, son!

2187
01:58:50,560 --> 01:58:52,130
I won't, sir!

2188
01:58:52,920 --> 01:58:56,129
<i>Up here in the blue
It's</i> a <i>marvellous view!</i>

2189
01:58:56,280 --> 01:58:59,807
<i>Side by side
is the best way to fly</i>

2190
01:59:00,080 --> 01:59:04,324
<i>Once I just looked above
but now I am part of</i>

2191
01:59:04,480 --> 01:59:07,484
<i>The lovely London sky!</i>

2192
01:59:11,600 --> 01:59:14,285
Would you like to try
one yourself, sir?

2193
01:59:16,240 --> 01:59:18,004
Well, I'll give it a go.

2194
01:59:18,160 --> 01:59:19,650
All right, love.

2195
01:59:20,360 --> 01:59:22,249
Choose carefully.

2196
01:59:34,800 --> 01:59:38,009
Well, nowhere to go but up.

2197
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:41,923
When the <i>clouds</i> make a muss

2198
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:43,843
<i>Well, I won't make a fuss</i>

2199
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:45,843
<i>But I'll polish the stars</i>

2200
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:47,570
<i>Ellen, better let us!</i>

2201
01:59:47,720 --> 01:59:51,486
<i>Give</i> a <i>lift to</i> a <i>foe
For you reap what you sow</i>

2202
01:59:51,640 --> 01:59:54,564
<i>And there's nowhere
to go but up!</i>

2203
01:59:57,800 --> 01:59:59,928
I've set sail!

2204
02:00:00,080 --> 02:00:02,162
Chart a course, Mr. Binnacle!

2205
02:00:02,320 --> 02:00:04,084
That I will, sir!

2206
02:00:08,400 --> 02:00:12,166
<i>If your day's up the spout</i>

2207
02:00:12,320 --> 02:00:14,288
<i>Well, there isn't a doubt</i>

2208
02:00:14,440 --> 02:00:17,603
<i>There's nowhere to go
but up</i>

2209
02:00:21,680 --> 02:00:25,287
<i>And if you don't believe
Just hang onto my sleeve</i>

2210
02:00:25,440 --> 02:00:28,649
<i>For there's nowhere
to go but up</i>

2211
02:00:32,680 --> 02:00:36,526
<i>As you fly over town
It gets harder to frown</i>

2212
02:00:36,680 --> 02:00:38,489
<i>And We'll all hit the heights</i>

2213
02:00:38,560 --> 02:00:40,289
<i>If we never look down</i>

2214
02:00:40,440 --> 02:00:44,206
<i>Let the past take a bow
The forever is now</i>

2215
02:00:44,360 --> 02:00:48,046
<i>And there's nowhere to go
but up, up!</i>

2216
02:00:48,200 --> 02:00:50,931
<i>There's nowhere to go
but up</i>

2217
02:00:58,080 --> 02:01:00,924
Of course, the grown-ups
will all forget by tomorrow.

2218
02:01:01,080 --> 02:01:02,844
They always do.

2219
02:01:03,480 --> 02:01:06,086
Only one balloon left,
Mary Poppins.

2220
02:01:06,880 --> 02:01:08,723
I think it must be yours.

2221
02:01:09,320 --> 02:01:11,448
Yes, I suppose it must.

2222
02:01:17,960 --> 02:01:20,531
Practically perfect
in every way.

2223
02:01:36,360 --> 02:01:37,441
Welcome home, everyone.

2224
02:01:37,640 --> 02:01:39,688
It's nice to be back,
isn't it?

2225
02:01:39,760 --> 02:01:41,649
It is, it's so nice.

2226
02:01:42,200 --> 02:01:43,201
I never thought I'd feel

2227
02:01:43,280 --> 02:01:45,681
this much joy and wonder
ever again.

2228
02:01:45,840 --> 02:01:48,127
I thought that door
was closed to me forever.

2229
02:02:12,080 --> 02:02:13,127
Come on, let's go!

2230
02:02:13,200 --> 02:02:14,201
Race you up the stairs!

2231
02:02:14,280 --> 02:02:15,461
No fair,
you got a head start.

2232
02:02:15,520 --> 02:02:16,885
Wait for me.

2233
02:02:20,440 --> 02:02:21,601
It's time.

2234
02:02:35,400 --> 02:02:37,482
She's gone, hasn't she,
Michael?

2235
02:02:43,840 --> 02:02:45,649
Thank you, Mary Poppins.

2236
02:02:47,280 --> 02:02:48,441
Good bye.

2237
02:03:00,960 --> 02:03:03,566
I won't forget, Mary Poppins.
Promise.

2238
02:03:05,840 --> 02:03:08,491
<i>So hold on tight
to those you love</i>

2239
02:03:08,640 --> 02:03:11,644
<i>And maybe soon from up above</i>

2240
02:03:11,800 --> 02:03:16,567
<i>You'll be blessed,
so keep on looking high</i>

2241
02:03:16,720 --> 02:03:23,604
<i>While you're underneath
the lovely London</i>

2242
02:03:23,880 --> 02:03:27,009
<i>SKY</i>

2243
02:05:42,840 --> 02:05:46,401
<i>If your day's up the spout</i>

2244
02:05:46,480 --> 02:05:48,721
<i>Well, there isn't a doubt</i>

2245
02:05:48,800 --> 02:05:51,371
<i>There's nowhere to go but up</i>

2246
02:05:52,160 --> 02:05:55,926
<i>And if you don't believe
Just hang onto my sleeve</i>

2247
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:58,924
<i>For there's nowhere to go
but up</i>

2248
02:05:59,840 --> 02:06:03,640
<i>As you fly over town
