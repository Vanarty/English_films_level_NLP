164
00:09:16,137 --> 00:09:17,366
JENNY:
Come on.

165
00:09:17,539 --> 00:09:20,304
See? I knew there wouldn't be
any weirdness between you two.

166
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:24,645
- Connor, you remember Sandra?
- Yes, I do. How are you, Sandra?

167
00:09:25,486 --> 00:09:28,047
You know, it's not too late
to get out, gorgeous.

168
00:09:28,223 --> 00:09:29,486
He's joking.

169
00:09:29,659 --> 00:09:31,457
And you know the bridesmaids.

170
00:09:31,628 --> 00:09:34,998
Oh, yes, I do. Deena, Donna.
How are you?

171
00:09:35,168 --> 00:09:36,328
- And, uh...?
- Denice.

172
00:09:36,503 --> 00:09:39,065
CONNOR: Nice to meet you, Denice. Ladies.
- Me too. How are you?

173
00:09:39,241 --> 00:09:42,076
PAUL: My groomsmen.
Guys, this is my brother, Connor.

174
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:44,248
- We've heard the stories, man.
CONNOR: Oh, okay.

175
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:47,478
- An honor to be serving with you.
- And with you.

176
00:09:47,653 --> 00:09:50,284
It's "mice" to "neet" you.
Damn it, I blew it.

177
00:09:50,459 --> 00:09:52,552
JENNY: Sorry to break up the bromance,
guys, but...

178
00:09:52,729 --> 00:09:55,359
...I need you right here
where I can keep my eyes on you.

179
00:09:55,534 --> 00:09:58,060
- Absolutely.
- Are we ready?

180
00:09:58,237 --> 00:09:59,330
Yes, sorry, sarge.

181
00:09:59,841 --> 00:10:02,037
Sarge?
Are they getting married by a cop?

182
00:10:02,212 --> 00:10:05,410
Sergeant Major Volcom,
United States Marine Corps.

183
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:08,384
I am not a cop.

184
00:10:09,856 --> 00:10:13,693
- Where'd you find this ray of sunshine?
PAUL: He's Sandra's dad.

185
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:16,959
Sarge, this is my brother, Connor.
Connor, this is the sarge.

186
00:10:17,135 --> 00:10:19,128
He was ordained right after the war.

187
00:10:19,306 --> 00:10:22,675
Little war called Korea.
Perhaps you've heard of it, slick?

188
00:10:22,845 --> 00:10:24,677
Lost more men than Nam.

189
00:10:24,849 --> 00:10:27,216
We didn't get a wall.
We didn't get a movie.

190
00:10:27,385 --> 00:10:30,846
We got a sitcom with Alan Alda
which was all nonstop laughs...

191
00:10:31,024 --> 00:10:33,425
...unless you were the one
watching his friends die.

192
00:10:33,595 --> 00:10:36,122
The war's over, Dad. It was a tie.

193
00:10:36,299 --> 00:10:39,168
You know, we should probably try
to keep going on schedule.

194
00:10:39,338 --> 00:10:41,706
- Hua.
- Hua.

195
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:45,939
Following the kiss at 1530 hours,
on my mark...

196
00:10:46,115 --> 00:10:48,084
...groom will take bride's left forearm...

197
00:10:48,252 --> 00:10:52,317
...rotate 180 degrees,
orienting north by northwest.

198
00:10:52,493 --> 00:10:55,360
Then I will announce you
as husband and wife.

199
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:57,523
Following which...

200
00:10:59,302 --> 00:11:03,367
Following which,
you will live happily ever after.

00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:09,582
DENICE: So sweet. Oh, my God.
DEENA: That is sweet.

204
00:11:10,721 --> 00:11:13,419
- I'm surrounded by huggers.
- There we go.

205
00:11:13,594 --> 00:11:16,529
- No, we're cool, man.
- Come on.

206
00:11:27,849 --> 00:11:31,287
Hey, Uncle Wayne.

207
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:38,288
Ah, the world's a lot less fun
without you in it, buddy.

208
00:11:43,073 --> 00:11:45,407
Oh, no. Oh, no.

209
00:11:45,577 --> 00:11:49,071
No decorations in here. No.

210
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,744
No. No.

211
00:11:51,922 --> 00:11:54,153
And, yes.

212
00:11:54,325 --> 00:11:55,350
No.

213
00:11:56,796 --> 00:12:01,166
- No! Wha...? What did...? What the...?
- Something wrong?

214
00:12:03,641 --> 00:12:06,133
I got over 30 scented candles
in my room.

215
00:12:06,311 --> 00:12:09,043
- Oh, the wedding scent is lavender.
- The wedding scent?

216
00:12:09,216 --> 00:12:12,153
- And people wonder why I'm not married.
- Not really.

217
00:12:12,321 --> 00:12:16,020
I mean, seriously, Jenny, my Uncle Wayne
is rolling over in his grave right now.

218
00:12:16,193 --> 00:12:18,163
No, come on. Wayne loved a good party.

219
00:12:18,331 --> 00:12:22,393
Party, yes. A wedding? No.
Back in the day that man used this place...

220
00:12:22,569 --> 00:12:27,100
...for mind-numbing, clothing-optional,
weeklong orgies, okay?

221
00:12:27,277 --> 00:12:29,577
Do you know Dean Martin
slept in that bathroom?

222
00:12:29,748 --> 00:12:32,878
He drank from the bidet
and sang the Canadian national anthem...

223
00:12:33,054 --> 00:12:34,352
...in Spanish.
- In Spanish.

224
00:12:34,523 --> 00:12:40,124
- Yeah, I remember Wayne telling us that.
- Yeah. Now that, that was a party. Not this.

225
00:12:42,103 --> 00:12:45,403
You know, people were taking bets
on whether or not you'd even show up.

226
00:12:45,574 --> 00:12:47,975
- Miss my kid brother's wedding?
- That's what I said.

227
00:12:48,144 --> 00:12:51,605
The whole asshole thing you do
is to get insecure women to sleep with you.

228
00:12:51,784 --> 00:12:55,620
- Deep down, you're a big sweetheart.
- Oh. Look who's got me pegged.

229
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:59,593
And there's the sarcasm to cover up
the accidental display of affection for Paul.

230
00:12:59,764 --> 00:13:01,232
Hey.

231
00:13:02,068 --> 00:13:03,593
I'm not covering anything up.

232
00:13:04,337 --> 00:13:09,506
And I would also be more than happy to
take off the rest of my clothes to prove it.

233
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:13,915
Then there's the cheap sexual innuendo.
All the old Connor Mead tricks are back.

00:13:14,087 --> 00:13:17,251
Well, don't worry,
your secret's safe with me.

Oh. Kids?

00:13:38,659 --> 00:13:40,959
What? They're not really married
unless they have kids.

I'm a huge fan of your work.

- Gonna photograph your brother's wedding?

No. No, I'm not a wedding photographer.

- Right.

00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:23,458

with their clothes on.

00:14:48,106 --> 00:14:52,238
- Endive arugula salad. You did well...
- No, no, no. The salad I ordered had figs.

269
00:14:52,412 --> 00:14:56,316
Yeah, because fruit is the new crouton.
This is...

Paulie, you know where I come out
on all this, buddy.

309
00:16:48,933 --> 00:16:53,339
To me, marriage is an archaic
and oppressive institution...

310
00:16:53,507 --> 00:16:55,635
...that should a been abolished years ago.

311
00:16:55,810 --> 00:17:00,512
And love? It's magical comfort food
for the weak and the uneducated.

312
00:17:00,685 --> 00:17:02,882
Yeah, it makes you feel all warm
and relevant...

313
00:17:03,056 --> 00:17:07,290
...but in the end, love leaves you weak,
dependant and fat.

314
00:17:08,296 --> 00:17:11,461
- Yeah, that might not make the best toast.
- Are you saying I'm fat?

315
00:17:11,635 --> 00:17:13,502
- No. Are you kidding?
PAUL: No, no, no.

I wish I could believe in all this crap. I do.

319
00:17:25,926 --> 00:17:28,394
And I also wish I could believe
in the Easter bunny...

320
00:17:28,562 --> 00:17:32,023
...the missile shield,
and strippers with a heart of gold, all right?

321
00:17:32,203 --> 00:17:36,767
But, unfortunately, I am condemned
to see the world as it really is.

322
00:17:36,944 --> 00:17:39,345
And love? Love is a myth.

00:38:18,341 --> 00:38:22,974
Makes them feel more powerful, which
in turn makes them feel more comfortable.

656
00:38:23,149 --> 00:38:26,087
Which in turn makes them prone
to massive errors in judgment...

657
00:38:26,255 --> 00:38:30,284
...like, having sex with a complete stranger
in the port authority bathroom. Ha, ha.

658
00:38:30,462 --> 00:38:32,693
But I'm not even supposed
to talk to strangers.

659
00:38:32,865 --> 00:38:35,130
No, that's good, that's good.
No talking is good.

660

No phone numbers, no last names.
Hey, no first names if you can swing it.

661

Will somebody please
call Child Protective Services?

662
00:38:41,847 --> 00:38:43,543
Shh. Quiet, the prophet speaks.

663
00:38:43,717 --> 00:38:47,246
See, kid, an ugly broad, you might as well
take her out behind the shed...

664
00:38:47,423 --> 00:38:49,984
...and put one behind the ear.
That dog won't hunt.

665
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,722
But any dude with a johnson,
he's got a shot...

666
00:38:52,898 --> 00:38:57,803
...because cool comes from the inside.
- God, I miss that man.

667
00:38:57,973 --> 00:38:59,441
WAYNE:
So here's a couple of tips.

668
00:38:59,609 --> 00:39:04,447
When you first meet a girl, you give her
two compliments, above the neck.

669
00:39:04,617 --> 00:39:08,077
You tell her she's got nice lips,
nice eyes, nice hair...

670
00:39:08,256 --> 00:39:11,819
...she's intelligent, her moral ethics,
whatever crap comes to your mind.

671
00:39:11,995 --> 00:39:15,229
Then, just when she begins to think
that you're another, you know...

672
00:39:15,401 --> 00:39:19,305
...vanilla-nice guy that she can tool around
with all night without getting naked...

673
00:39:20,141 --> 00:39:25,981
...you insult her. Flip the power dynamic,
and you let her know you're here to play.

674
00:39:26,151 --> 00:39:30,420
- Well, Jenny said she doesn't like games.
- Forget about that broad.

675
00:39:30,592 --> 00:39:34,291
- I thought all this was to get her back.
- That's why you gotta forget about her.

676
00:39:34,464 --> 00:39:37,867
It's your feelings for her
that are killing your game.

677
00:39:38,405 --> 00:39:42,241
If there's one thing
that you learn tonight, it's this:

678
00:39:42,411 --> 00:39:47,647
The power of a relationship lies
with whoever cares less.

679
00:39:49,855 --> 00:39:51,620
Amen to that, brother.

680
00:39:51,793 --> 00:39:54,423
One day you're gonna wake up
with some chick, spooning...

681
00:39:54,598 --> 00:39:56,226
...you know, thinking about love.

682
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,528
And at that moment,
you have gotta get up.

683
00:39:58,705 --> 00:40:01,606
Do not walk, don't get your shoes,
run the hell out of there.

684
00:40:01,774 --> 00:40:04,040
Because maybe not the next day
or the next week...

685
00:40:04,212 --> 00:40:07,945
...but sometime in the future,
you're gonna get crushed. Again.

686
00:40:08,753 --> 00:40:10,746
- You don't wanna feel that way, do you?
- No.

687
00:40:10,924 --> 00:40:12,687
- No.
- Yep.

688
00:40:12,859 --> 00:40:17,857
Okay, so, uh, let's get down
to brass tacks here.

689
00:40:18,435 --> 00:40:22,840
Say I wanted to pick up
on that ice-cold blond at eight o'clock.

690
00:40:23,009 --> 00:40:25,946
Eight o'clock? How did you even see her?

691
00:40:26,115 --> 00:40:28,914
We'll deal with reflective surfaces
at another time.

692
00:40:29,085 --> 00:40:31,921
Should I, uh, get a handful a daisies,
then go:

693
00:40:32,091 --> 00:40:34,059
"Hi, you wanna go to the disco with me?"

694
00:40:34,227 --> 00:40:35,787
Uh...

695
00:40:35,964 --> 00:40:36,989
- No?
- No.

696
00:40:37,166 --> 00:40:40,535
No, because I might as well say,
"I'm a fag. Let's be friends."

697
00:40:40,705 --> 00:40:45,576
So, what would be a smart play?
Have some fun with it. What do you think?

...you could maybe
talk to the girl next to her?

700
00:40:52,089 --> 00:40:53,854
You know, maybe make her feel jealous?

701
00:40:57,532 --> 00:41:03,475
Hand to God, kid, I never felt
like you were my son until now.

702
00:41:07,013 --> 00:41:10,918
Man, I don't know why we didn't have
this conversation years ago, huh?

Well, that's enough for one night.

- No, no, no.

- Aah! Aah!

983
00:58:54,966 --> 00:58:56,901
VOLCOM:
He's not worth it, sweetheart.

984
00:58:57,069 --> 00:58:59,733
I'm fine. I'm fine.

985
00:58:59,908 --> 00:59:02,173
I am a lady.

986
00:59:02,344 --> 00:59:04,940
I am a professional.

987
00:59:05,484 --> 00:59:07,715
And I'm fine.

988
00:59:08,388 --> 00:59:11,882
PAUL: Let's get out of here.
- Okay, see if you can stabilize the bride.

989
00:59:12,060 --> 00:59:15,328
I've got the cake and childcare.
Brad, some shiatsu for Sandra, please?

990
00:59:15,500 --> 00:59:17,058
Let's see some happy faces.

991
00:59:17,469 --> 00:59:18,528
Big happy, big happy.

992
00:59:18,704 --> 00:59:20,731
Oh, where do you think you're going?

993
00:59:21,476 --> 00:59:23,570
- Breathe.
BRAD: Let me know if the pressure's okay.

994
00:59:23,745 --> 00:59:25,408
There you go.

995
00:59:26,551 --> 00:59:28,610
- Thank you, Denice.
- Thank you.

996
00:59:28,787 --> 00:59:30,916
- Okay. Oh, that's good.
- She's freaking out.

997
00:59:31,091 --> 00:59:33,560
- I know.
- Connor is ruining the wedding.

998
00:59:33,729 --> 00:59:36,757
He is also ruining
Operation Sex For Every Bridesmaid.

999
00:59:36,934 --> 00:59:38,835
- I almost hooked up with Connor.
- What?

1000
00:59:39,003 --> 00:59:41,530
When he told me to go by his room,
the door was locked.

1001
00:59:41,708 --> 00:59:43,439
I could hear him talking to himself.

1002
00:59:43,612 --> 00:59:45,204
Dude, that guy takes mind games...

1003
00:59:45,380 --> 00:59:47,350
...to the next level.
- Old school.

1004
00:59:47,518 --> 00:59:49,750
- So who's next?
- I'm up.

1005
00:59:49,921 --> 00:59:52,221
Oh, wait. Are you the one
that slept with Paul?

1006
00:59:52,392 --> 00:59:54,089
- No.
- Because he won't go there.

1007
00:59:54,730 --> 00:59:58,099
- Ew. What?
- That would be me.

1008
00:59:59,571 --> 01:00:02,336
- Shut up. Shut your face.
- No. You never told us that.

1009
01:00:02,508 --> 01:00:06,038
Well, I'm paying the price. Looks like
I'm gonna have to get plastered...

1010
01:00:06,215 --> 01:00:08,878
...and downgrade
to one of Paul's desperate work friends.

1011
01:00:09,052 --> 01:00:11,614
I can transmit, page, pilot
and sync channels now.

1012
01:00:11,790 --> 01:00:15,023
- What channel are you on?
- Hey, guys, holster them.

1013
01:00:15,864 --> 01:00:17,799
- Why?
- Women.

1014
01:00:17,967 --> 01:00:19,128
Oh.

1015
01:00:19,303 --> 01:00:21,330
- Say it isn't so.
- They're so weird.

1016
01:00:24,209 --> 01:00:28,945
- Yeah, somebody is enjoying this a little bit.
- Ha, ha. Are you kidding me?

1017
01:00:29,117 --> 01:00:32,886
Connor Mead, cleaning up his own mess.
I am loving it.

1018
01:00:33,925 --> 01:00:36,418
You know what? I'm sorry.

1019
01:00:37,031 --> 01:00:39,500
It's a cake.
There'll be a bakery open in town.

1020
01:00:39,668 --> 01:00:42,537
I'm not talking about this.

1021
01:00:43,141 --> 01:00:47,044
I'm talking about us. You know?

1022
01:00:47,347 --> 01:00:49,681
How it played out.

1023
01:00:49,852 --> 01:00:52,185
You're actually apologizing, aren't you?

1024
01:00:52,356 --> 01:00:55,259
Okay, we don't need
to make a production out of it, now.

1025
01:00:55,427 --> 01:00:58,090
How are things looking? Spick-and-span?
Any more spots?

1026
01:00:58,265 --> 01:01:02,967
You know, it was probably,
in some small way, partially my fault.

1027
01:01:03,140 --> 01:01:05,939
- I was always attracted to assholes.
- Thank you very much.

1028
01:01:06,111 --> 01:01:09,913
Well, you know what I mean, though.
Projects. Guys that I thought I could fix.

1029
01:01:10,084 --> 01:01:12,553
Probably has something to do
with my dad.

1030
01:01:12,755 --> 01:01:15,692
- Probably.
- After you left, I made a vow to myself...

1031
01:01:15,860 --> 01:01:18,558
...to date only fully functional,
well-adjusted men.

1032
01:01:18,731 --> 01:01:24,263
- No more works-in-progress. No dirtbags.
- So basically, women.

1033
01:01:24,441 --> 01:01:26,103
Basically women.

1034
01:01:26,277 --> 01:01:31,809
So how strong of a vow
is your no-dirtbags policy?

1035
01:01:31,986 --> 01:01:34,547
I had it tattooed on my ass.

1036
01:01:36,694 --> 01:01:38,891
- Can I see?
- No.

1037
01:01:40,299 --> 01:01:42,097
- Wait, what are you doing?
- What?

1038
01:01:42,270 --> 01:01:43,670
- What?
- What am I doing? Wha...?

1039
01:01:43,839 --> 01:01:48,472
Okay, look. I know I dropped the ball
before a bit, but I have changed, I swear.

1040
01:01:48,647 --> 01:01:50,114
- No, you haven't.
- No, I have.

1041
01:01:50,282 --> 01:01:54,483
Jenny, I'm seeing things
in a whole different way tonight.

1042
01:01:54,656 --> 01:01:58,253
All right? I love you. I think.
I mean, I always have.

1043
01:01:58,428 --> 01:02:01,888
- You're the one I was supposed to be with.
- Wait, Connor, stop it. Just...

1044
01:02:02,502 --> 01:02:06,168
I hear what you're saying,
and I think right now you actually believe it.

1045
01:02:06,342 --> 01:02:09,802
- Yeah.
- But I know you.

1046
01:02:11,116 --> 01:02:13,585
Tomorrow morning, I'll wake up.

1047
01:02:14,888 --> 01:02:16,652
You won't be there.

1048
01:02:17,593 --> 01:02:21,498
Okay, but, Jenny, I really, really don't
wanna be alone tonight, you know?

1049
01:02:21,666 --> 01:02:23,999
- Okay. No, I get it.
- Will you please stay with me?

1050
01:02:24,737 --> 01:02:27,766
Seriously!
Jenny, I've got ghosts in my bedroom!

1051
01:02:31,682 --> 01:02:33,742
WOMAN: Hello, Connor.
- Aah!

1052
01:02:35,687 --> 01:02:36,951
Dude.

1053
01:02:37,124 --> 01:02:40,926
What does a girl have to do
to get laid at this wedding?

1054
01:02:43,968 --> 01:02:47,634
Yeah. Four Seasons, please.

1055
01:02:51,748 --> 01:02:54,741
- Come on, start. Aah!
- Where do you think you're going?

1056
01:02:57,055 --> 01:03:01,791
Oh, Mel. God, you don't know
how happy I am to see you.

1057
01:03:02,598 --> 01:03:04,157
Aah!

1058
01:03:04,335 --> 01:03:07,396
Really, did you learn nothing
from the last ghost?

1059
01:03:07,874 --> 01:03:09,900
- You're the ghost of girlfriends present?
- Mm-hm.

1060
01:03:10,077 --> 01:03:12,411
- That makes no sense.
- Oh, tell me about it.

1061
01:03:12,581 --> 01:03:15,815
But as sad as it is,
I'm the only consistent woman in your life.

1062
01:03:15,987 --> 01:03:20,187
So here I am,
just working on the weekend. Again.

1063
01:03:20,360 --> 01:03:21,851
But we never...

1064
01:03:22,029 --> 01:03:23,498
I mean, you...

1065
01:03:23,665 --> 01:03:25,726
- You're totally gay, right?
- What?

1066
01:03:25,903 --> 01:03:26,928
You're not?

1067
01:03:27,105 --> 01:03:31,168
No. There was just one time in college.
I went to Barnard.

1068
01:03:31,345 --> 01:03:32,939
- Okay.
- I had no choice.

1069
01:03:33,115 --> 01:03:34,707
Hey, I'm sorry, Mel.

1070
01:03:34,884 --> 01:03:37,446
If I'd have known,
I would of hit on you a lot sooner.

1071
01:03:37,622 --> 01:03:39,523
Aw. Ha, ha.

1072
01:03:39,691 --> 01:03:43,356
- Ow! What was that for?
- Because tonight, I'm the boss.

1073
01:03:43,530 --> 01:03:44,999
You ready?

1074
01:03:49,675 --> 01:03:51,734
What are you doing?

1075
01:03:53,581 --> 01:03:57,212
Aren't we gonna, like,
fly off or something?

1076
01:03:57,387 --> 01:04:01,155
It's the present, you idiot.
We're here already.

1077
01:04:06,468 --> 01:04:07,492
Mel.

1078
01:04:08,437 --> 01:04:11,432
PAUL: Okay, no. That is not what I said.
WOMAN: I don't care.

1079
01:04:11,610 --> 01:04:13,738
He's a beautiful piece of a man.

1080
01:04:13,913 --> 01:04:18,046
Hey, look at how much fun they're having
now that you're gone.

1081
01:04:18,487 --> 01:04:20,046
- He's not shallow.
- Shallow?

1082
01:04:20,223 --> 01:04:23,058
Honey, he spends every Christmas alone
at the Knicks game.

1083
01:04:23,228 --> 01:04:24,354
Yeah, he is all surface.

1084
01:04:24,530 --> 01:04:28,128
Yeah, but in his defense,
it's a really hot surface.

1085
01:04:28,303 --> 01:04:30,397
- Well, yeah.
- Okay, he's not that bad.

1086
01:04:30,573 --> 01:04:34,012
- Thank you, Paulie.
DEENA: Paul, he hit on your mother in law.

1087
01:04:34,180 --> 01:04:36,979
- I've banged worse.
- Thank you, Vonda.

1088
01:04:37,150 --> 01:04:38,710
ALL:
Oh!

1089
01:04:38,887 --> 01:04:42,120
You guys just don't know him like I do.
You don't.

1090
01:04:42,293 --> 01:04:44,626
You know, that guy practically raised me.

1091
01:04:45,097 --> 01:04:50,368
I was 2 when our parents died.
Connor was just 7.

1092
01:04:50,973 --> 01:04:56,438
You know, at an age when he's supposed
to be a kid, he's busy taking care of one.

1093
01:04:56,915 --> 01:04:59,010
He taught me how to read.

1094
01:05:00,555 --> 01:05:03,320
He taught me how to ride a bike.

1095
01:05:04,428 --> 01:05:08,423
He beat the crap out of any kid
who ever teased me.

1096
01:05:08,601 --> 01:05:12,939
You know, he always said,
"Paulie, it's you and me against the world."

1097
01:05:14,144 --> 01:05:19,517
My point is, I had the opportunity
to be a nice kid and Connor didn't.

1098
01:05:19,986 --> 01:05:23,516
Now, I know he seems like a joke
to you guys...

1099
01:05:23,693 --> 01:05:28,962
...and trust me, you all have fair points,
but that guy is the only family I've got.

1100
01:05:29,134 --> 01:05:30,966
And if there's one thing family does...

1101
01:05:31,137 --> 01:05:36,043
...it is believe, against all odds,
in the best of each other.

1102
01:05:41,420 --> 01:05:42,581
I love him.

1103
01:05:42,757 --> 01:05:46,752
And as long as I live,
I'll believe he can change, because he's...

1104
01:05:47,765 --> 01:05:49,733
He's my big brother.

1105
01:05:54,441 --> 01:05:56,434
I'm gonna call my brother.

1106
01:05:56,612 --> 01:05:58,171
It's been a while.

1107
01:05:59,584 --> 01:06:01,781
Of course,
that doesn't mean anything to you.

1108
01:06:02,255 --> 01:06:04,451
Because love doesn't exist, right?

1109
01:06:04,625 --> 01:06:08,723
It's just, "magical comfort food
for the weak and uneducated"?

1110
01:06:08,899 --> 01:06:14,168
Wow, that is as close as I will ever come
to feeling something for Connor Mead.

1111
01:06:14,340 --> 01:06:16,776
- Kudos.
- I saw you chatting him up at the bar.

1112
01:06:17,412 --> 01:06:22,443
Well, I still wanna do him,
but now I'll be scrumping a tragic figure.

1113
01:06:22,621 --> 01:06:26,890
Ooh, like when Denice hooked up
with Gary Coleman at Lollapalooza.

1114
01:06:27,462 --> 01:06:31,663
I was drunk
and he had such delicate hands.

1115
01:06:32,270 --> 01:06:36,037
Denice, you think that's bad? I mean,
look at what Connor is doing to poor Jenny.

1116
01:06:36,209 --> 01:06:39,237
He has got that girl so twisted up
into a pretzel...

1117
01:06:39,414 --> 01:06:42,681
...she can't even appreciate
that fine slice of wedding beefcake...

1118
01:06:42,853 --> 01:06:45,688
...that Sandy has flown in for her.

1119
01:06:45,859 --> 01:06:47,326
Hua! Ha, ha.

1120
01:06:48,596 --> 01:06:51,533
Heard, understood, acknowledged?

1121
01:06:55,507 --> 01:06:56,702
Jenny, she's just...

1122
01:06:59,580 --> 01:07:01,243
Jenny.

1123
01:07:09,295 --> 01:07:12,665
- Oh, Jesus. Is she okay?
- What do you think?

1124
01:07:12,835 --> 01:07:14,234
BRAD:
Jenny?

1125
01:07:15,472 --> 01:07:18,807
Oh, of course.
Sensitive Brad to the rescue.

1126
01:07:18,978 --> 01:07:23,543
Now, wait a second, are you actually trying
to repair this wedding cake?

1127
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:25,547
Maybe.

1128
01:07:26,457 --> 01:07:30,259
- I mean, a little.
- I used to moonlight as a pastry chef.

1129
01:07:30,429 --> 01:07:33,424
- Tell me this guy's gay.
- He's not. Trust me.

1130
01:07:33,602 --> 01:07:35,661
- Really?
- No. Not really.

1131
01:07:35,839 --> 01:07:38,240
[BOTH LAUGHING]

1132
01:07:38,676 --> 01:07:40,406
You wanna talk about it?

1133
01:07:40,580 --> 01:07:43,573
As your designated wedding sex,
everything you say is privileged.

1134
01:07:43,751 --> 01:07:45,550
No, I just...

1135
01:07:45,721 --> 01:07:49,955
I mean, it's been like a decade
since Connor and l... You know.

1136
01:07:50,763 --> 01:07:54,201
But I see him again, and I am just right back
to where I was before.

1137
01:07:54,368 --> 01:07:57,601
My attending in med school used to say
that doctors never break up...

1138
01:07:57,774 --> 01:08:02,077
...we just go into remission. We're naturally
drawn to the most hopeless patients.

1139
01:08:02,248 --> 01:08:05,150
The irredeemably screwed up.
The terminal cases.

1140
01:08:05,319 --> 01:08:09,315
- We get the point, Brad.
